I am rep (0:00 - 0:03)
[Music] (0:05 - 0:14)
am what&#39;s up everyone welcome to the (0:14 - 0:21)
623 episode of the Pokemon podcast it&#39;s (0:18 - 0:23)
super effective I&#39;m your host Steve with (0:21 - 0:27)
me is Hannah I am here I finally got a (0:23 - 0:29)
karat this morning we will talk about (0:27 - 0:32)
that we will talk about that we sure (0:29 - 0:36)
will Bobby also here I have returned (0:32 - 0:40)
from the Grand Canyon and uh I will tell (0:36 - 0:42)
you one thing I learned about the Grand (0:40 - 0:46)
Canyon it&#39;s pretty massive so uh they&#39;re (0:42 - 0:48)
not wrong in naming it the Grand Canyon (0:46 - 0:50)
you left your (0:48 - 0:53)
house you hate traveling I do hate (0:50 - 0:56)
traveling but we drove and it was fine (0:53 - 0:59)
uh it was it was not that long of a (0:56 - 1:01)
drive it was a 7 hour drive but we broke (0:59 - 1:04)
it up into two days cuz I have little (1:01 - 1:07)
kids and they would cannot sit in the (1:04 - 1:09)
car for seven hours not that long of a (1:07 - 1:12)
drive seven hours is pretty long maybe (1:09 - 1:16)
not to Americans yeah yeah I guess I (1:12 - 1:19)
mean I don&#39;t take too many road trips so (1:16 - 1:20)
I mean like this is longer than most (1:19 - 1:23)
trips that I do take usually it&#39;s like (1:20 - 1:24)
five hours if I&#39;m going to drive (1:23 - 1:28)
somewhere but yeah it&#39;s fine I feel like (1:24 - 1:33)
anything over six for me is like (1:28 - 1:37)
G like two to three feels pretty easy to (1:33 - 1:41)
drive yeah yeah I&#39;ve done many many (1:37 - 1:43)
weekends or like many like Saturdays (1:41 - 1:44)
where when I used to go to like car (1:43 - 1:46)
shows and stuff they were always in La (1:44 - 1:48)
so I did many Saturdays where I was (1:46 - 1:50)
driving two hours to LA and two hours (1:48 - 1:51)
back like (1:50 - 1:54)
within four or five hours of each other (1:51 - 1:57)
so one of the hours was completely in La (1:54 - 2:01)
I would assume yeah exactly one hour to (1:57 - 2:04)
get down the street (2:01 - 2:06)
yeah uh well we have a show for you guys (2:04 - 2:09)
I got back from Spain earlier this week (2:06 - 2:12)
so uh we do have some Pokemon go news (2:09 - 2:14)
but I&#39;ll save my impressions of Spain go (2:12 - 2:16)
Fest for that segment of the (2:14 - 2:21)
show and uh unfortunately we&#39;ll have to (2:16 - 2:25)
talk about this AI art show stuff (2:21 - 2:27)
which if you&#39;ve listened to this podcast (2:25 - 2:31)
for some amount of years I always always (2:27 - 2:33)
have disliked this art show thing they (2:31 - 2:36)
do every I think it&#39;s every year they do (2:33 - 2:39)
it um (2:36 - 2:41)
but we I guess we&#39;ll get to that after (2:39 - 2:44)
our break let&#39;s get to the good stuff (2:41 - 2:45)
Pokemon (2:44 - 2:48)
sleeve (2:45 - 2:48)
uh uh it is karant week uh I was on the (2:49 - 2:56)
beach uh where did you guys go I was (2:53 - 3:00)
also on the beach also on the beach h on (2:56 - 3:03)
the beach stepping on the (3:00 - 3:07)
beach um it was fine I mean like it was (3:03 - 3:10)
a pretty normal week I focused all on I (3:07 - 3:12)
like I didn&#39;t I had a berry finding (3:10 - 3:14)
Totodile but I (3:12 - 3:18)
didn&#39;t feel like it was good enough to (3:14 - 3:19)
level (3:18 - 3:22)
up uh but I went like all ingredients (3:19 - 3:25)
anyways uh with like a magnone to (3:22 - 3:29)
increase my pot size um and I was able (3:25 - 3:32)
to make what whatever The Inferno corn (3:29 - 3:33)
Curry whatever like the best thing you (3:32 - 3:35)
can make for curry (3:33 - 3:39)
is and I got to master ranks as of as of (3:35 - 3:41)
recording this right now I got to master (3:39 - 3:45)
rank 16 wow nice um nice with like no (3:41 - 3:49)
focus on berries at all just literally (3:45 - 3:51)
meals but if I like I when I think about (3:49 - 3:54)
it if I had like the feraligator there (3:51 - 3:58)
that would be like less ingredient (3:54 - 3:58)
finders I mean you&#39;re probably not (3:58 - 4:03)
running your ingredient bag down all the (4:01 - 4:07)
way every time you make a meal no uh (4:03 - 4:10)
every like I was using probably 120ish (4:07 - 4:13)
ingredients each meal and how big is (4:10 - 4:16)
your bag 600 (4:13 - 4:18)
yeah okay then you probably could have (4:16 - 4:21)
swapped in the feraligator wow no cuz (4:18 - 4:25)
cuz I needed the the Pokemon to get cuz (4:21 - 4:30)
it would take like 27 corn 27 uh or 25 (4:25 - 4:33)
fiery herb or whatever it&#39;s uh 27 fiery (4:30 - 4:39)
herb 14 corn 12 Ginger and uh 20 some 24 (4:33 - 4:42)
sausage yeah yeah and the the berry (4:39 - 4:44)
finding thing I had was just it was just (4:42 - 4:46)
getting (4:44 - 4:48)
oil and I was like I don&#39;t need I don&#39;t (4:46 - 4:51)
need more oil I got I got so much oil (4:48 - 4:56)
yeah also like a aund of my bag is Cacao (4:51 - 4:58)
which I like save that stuff for like (4:56 - 4:59)
dessert and then like another 100 is (4:58 - 5:01)
like Slowpoke (4:59 - 5:04)
Tails nice it just feels weird to use (5:01 - 5:06)
those ingredients as like filler M since (5:04 - 5:09)
like those well well Cacao is like super (5:06 - 5:11)
good for desserts and you can like burn (5:09 - 5:14)
through cacao way F like very fast if (5:11 - 5:15)
you have a dessert week but like (5:14 - 5:18)
Slowpoke tail is like I don&#39;t know it&#39;s (5:15 - 5:21)
just a slug to get yeah (5:18 - 5:23)
yeah (5:21 - 5:27)
yep yeah I well I don&#39;t have nearly as (5:23 - 5:30)
much uh I&#39;m not leveled nearly as high (5:27 - 5:33)
as you are but I I was able to get the (5:30 - 5:35)
The Good the good meal that you were (5:33 - 5:37)
just talking about the good curry once (5:35 - 5:40)
because I had saved up stuff from last (5:37 - 5:44)
week um but I had switched to yeah he (5:40 - 5:47)
was using Flareon to increase pot size (5:44 - 5:50)
and then um as soon as I got my crar an (5:47 - 5:52)
I was using crar an and that thing was (5:50 - 5:55)
triggering like almost every time I like (5:52 - 5:57)
clicked on it I feel like I was it was (5:55 - 6:00)
great and so I got multiple uh (5:57 - 6:02)
you know extra tasty meals or whatever (6:00 - 6:04)
throughout the week which was awesome uh (6:02 - 6:05)
just because you guys talk about it all (6:04 - 6:08)
the time with the den and GNA say you (6:05 - 6:11)
have a d right I don&#39;t have a d so I was (6:08 - 6:13)
very excited to get CR rant to be able (6:11 - 6:16)
to do that um but Steve you had a few CR (6:13 - 6:19)
RS right as of right now I have four oh (6:16 - 6:24)
my gosh uh hopefully one more before the (6:19 - 6:28)
end of the week wow uh I masterball two (6:24 - 6:30)
of them (6:28 - 6:33)
and then uh the other two just happen to (6:30 - 6:36)
be hungry which is crazy lucky for me (6:33 - 6:38)
because I&#39;ve never had a legendary (6:36 - 6:42)
hungry I never had uh a den (6:38 - 6:46)
hungry um the kar just likes you yeah I (6:42 - 6:49)
also oddly enough got three shinies this (6:46 - 6:55)
week oh in a uh which is frustrating cuz (6:49 - 6:58)
I would rather have karant and I would (6:55 - 7:01)
like a shiny karant but I got a shiny (6:58 - 7:02)
Vaporeon which actually had a really (7:01 - 7:05)
good roll on it um and then I got a (7:02 - 7:07)
Gulpin which is completely useless and (7:05 - 7:09)
then I got a gold duck which uh had a (7:07 - 7:12)
bad roll um which is also like kind of a (7:09 - 7:14)
bummer that I didn&#39;t get Psyduck because (7:12 - 7:16)
then like now I still need a side duck (7:14 - 7:17)
for the little (7:16 - 7:20)
profile icon picture because I just have (7:17 - 7:22)
gold (7:20 - 7:23)
duck (7:22 - 7:26)
so did you well how was your cramar an (7:23 - 7:30)
luck Hannah um I have been (7:26 - 7:32)
tired this week and I am learning that I (7:30 - 7:35)
uh don&#39;t press the button when I&#39;m super (7:32 - 7:38)
tired and that when I am playing solely (7:35 - 7:41)
on my phone is when I actually remember (7:38 - 7:43)
to start the sleep session so I missed a (7:41 - 7:46)
day or two but I got one cramar at this (7:43 - 7:48)
morning and it&#39;s really good for (7:46 - 7:50)
ingredients and it has a main skill (7:48 - 7:55)
chance down oh no (7:50 - 7:59)
yeah so very close if mints are ever a (7:55 - 8:01)
thing (7:59 - 8:03)
right did you get the crar an off of it (8:01 - 8:05)
was just a wild spawn like it was no it (8:03 - 8:07)
was just the incense I was saving the (8:05 - 8:10)
incense for the last day just in case uh (8:07 - 8:13)
yeah that makes sense the last day I (8:10 - 8:15)
guess mine was from the incense as well (8:13 - 8:16)
I haven&#39;t (8:15 - 8:19)
seen another one since then but luckily (8:16 - 8:22)
my first one was actually quite good so (8:19 - 8:26)
um I think it it&#39;s got some skill (8:22 - 8:28)
trigger at like level 25 it&#39;s got potato (8:26 - 8:32)
at level 30 and then I think it was exp (8:28 - 8:35)
gains are down but ingredient finding is (8:32 - 8:39)
up M it&#39;s really good yeah so I&#39;ve just (8:35 - 8:41)
been using that but I was I was hoping (8:39 - 8:43)
to at least get one more just to see to (8:41 - 8:46)
see one more this week um you buy (8:43 - 8:48)
another incense for no I&#39;m not doing the (8:46 - 8:52)
to $20 I&#39;m saving my I&#39;m saving my (8:48 - 8:54)
diamonds for I should be saving it for (8:52 - 8:56)
storage increase but I&#39;m saving them for (8:54 - 8:59)
like good camp tickets when I get weak (8:56 - 9:01)
and decide bag bag increase or (8:59 - 9:04)
ingredient bag increase is way better (9:01 - 9:06)
than Pokemon storage increase I know I (9:04 - 9:08)
yeah Pokemon storage I&#39;m fine with cuz (9:06 - 9:09)
I&#39;ll just I&#39;m good transferring them I&#39;m (9:08 - 9:11)
like Hannah over here who needs to keep (9:09 - 9:13)
every Hannah refuses to transfer (9:11 - 9:17)
anything I have 260 Pokemon Box Storage (9:13 - 9:20)
right now 234 of it is (9:17 - 9:24)
full I have a 100 I have 120 yeah I (9:20 - 9:27)
started started throwing them throwing (9:24 - 9:30)
them out it&#39;s just the value (9:27 - 9:33)
judgement it takes so much (9:30 - 9:36)
time five candy though five candy for (9:33 - 9:39)
each those I&#39;ve transferred enough (9:36 - 9:40)
Eevees that&#39;s most of what I needed (9:39 - 9:43)
candy for that&#39;s that&#39;s true how I did (9:40 - 9:46)
get a shin week how did you guys feel (9:43 - 9:48)
about the (9:46 - 9:52)
cromatic H I was not happy with the (9:48 - 9:54)
cromatic for the most (9:52 - 9:57)
part work as intended yeah that&#39;s the (9:54 - 9:59)
thing it was kind of random way too (9:57 - 10:00)
random (9:59 - 10:02)
like I was I was just like in the main (10:00 - 10:06)
series first like first day I it popped (10:02 - 10:08)
up I was like this is great okay I&#39;ll (10:06 - 10:12)
put 40 I forget what it was I fairy type (10:08 - 10:14)
I put some Pokemon where it I assumed (10:12 - 10:17)
like I&#39;m only putting this candy so like (10:14 - 10:20)
of course I&#39;ll get the type right let&#39;s (10:17 - 10:21)
say it was a water type so let&#39;s of (10:20 - 10:23)
course I&#39;ll get water candy and then it (10:21 - 10:25)
was like (10:23 - 10:27)
poison why did I just spend 40 water (10:25 - 10:30)
Pokemon candy to get a poison and candy (10:27 - 10:31)
like that&#39;s (10:30 - 10:34)
horrible yeah not not Happ with the (10:31 - 10:36)
camatic pretty much what happened to me (10:34 - 10:39)
too I remember putting 37 normal type of (10:36 - 10:41)
some sort in there and then however many (10:39 - 10:47)
left Pikachu and got poison back to back (10:41 - 10:50)
perfect which almost useful almost (10:47 - 10:51)
useless (10:50 - 10:53)
yep I don&#39;t know if it mentioned it and (10:51 - 10:56)
I just didn&#39;t notice or but like I did (10:53 - 10:58)
like that you could get two candies (10:56 - 11:00)
sometimes when it hit the (10:58 - 11:02)
exclamation point um and that seemed to (11:00 - 11:04)
be happening quite often for me it&#39;s (11:02 - 11:07)
just that it wasn&#39;t candy I wanted so (11:04 - 11:09)
you know uh there were a few times I got (11:07 - 11:11)
a couple like flying type candy when I (11:09 - 11:13)
put flying type in there for you know (11:11 - 11:16)
for crar an um and a couple water type (11:13 - 11:18)
because I was trying to evolve my War (11:16 - 11:22)
tle to Blastoise but I think I used it I (11:18 - 11:25)
was using it twice each day so I was I (11:22 - 11:29)
wasn&#39;t going up to the 15,000 shards I (11:25 - 11:33)
was just using it at like 1,000 and (11:29 - 11:33)
5,000 uh yeah I think people were saying (11:33 - 11:39)
that it was like a 30 35% chance of if (11:36 - 11:42)
you put 40 in you would get what you put (11:39 - 11:45)
in back and then it was like less of a (11:42 - 11:47)
chance if you did the the mixing of like (11:45 - 11:51)
20 and 20 or whatever uh I I I didn&#39;t (11:47 - 11:53)
realize this until like the second time (11:51 - 11:55)
I used it cuz the first time I used it I (11:53 - 11:57)
put in 40 flying and it gave me flying (11:55 - 11:58)
and I was like ah perfect worked as (11:57 - 12:00)
attended and then I put another 40 in (11:58 - 12:02)
and it got me like psychic and I was (12:00 - 12:05)
like hold on did I mess this (12:02 - 12:08)
up yeah yeah the blog post said when you (12:05 - 12:11)
put in say 40 Bulbasaur candies it would (12:08 - 12:13)
come out it would be slightly more (12:11 - 12:16)
likely to be a grass type but I guess (12:13 - 12:19)
slightly more likely is I thought I said (12:16 - 12:21)
it was like much more likely or (12:19 - 12:23)
something I was expecting it to be like (12:21 - 12:26)
90% that type if you put in like 40 of (12:23 - 12:29)
them but then what what what happens (12:26 - 12:32)
every time is I&#39;ll put in you know I&#39;ll (12:29 - 12:34)
get the wrong type and then I&#39;ll be fine (12:32 - 12:36)
I&#39;ll just put in 40 poison because it&#39;ll (12:34 - 12:38)
just be whatever right no it&#39;s poison of (12:36 - 12:39)
course then I get the thing that I it&#39;s (12:38 - 12:41)
like no I didn&#39;t want (12:39 - 12:43)
poison yeah I I ended up changing my (12:41 - 12:46)
strategy after like the first two days (12:43 - 12:49)
cuz I I I originally was like I&#39;m going (12:46 - 12:52)
to put in flying from do Duo because I (12:49 - 12:54)
don&#39;t need a do Duo and I&#39;m going to use (12:52 - 12:57)
that for the potential crar ants I get (12:54 - 12:59)
because crar an&#39;s flying in this game (12:57 - 13:03)
and and when that when that wasn&#39;t (12:59 - 13:05)
working my strategy was just I&#39;m going (13:03 - 13:10)
to put in Rattata and Gulpin and uh woba (13:05 - 13:12)
Fett like just the garbage ones and I (13:10 - 13:15)
don&#39;t ton of candy for yeah I just don&#39;t (13:12 - 13:17)
care what I I just want to use it to use (13:15 - 13:19)
it because anything is better than 900 (13:17 - 13:21)
woba Fett candy I&#39;m just never going to (13:19 - 13:23)
power up a woba Fett ever so if they&#39;re (13:21 - 13:25)
giving me psychic that&#39;s still good if (13:23 - 13:26)
they&#39;re giving me something else that&#39;s (13:25 - 13:29)
still good I used it twice a day every (13:26 - 13:32)
every day cuzz it did get I I just think (13:29 - 13:33)
level three and level (13:32 - 13:37)
four so expensive yeah (13:33 - 13:41)
yep yeah what&#39;s level four like 40,000 (13:37 - 13:44)
shards CU level three is (13:41 - 13:48)
15,000 oh yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s, or (13:44 - 13:50)
something it&#39;s super high though that&#39;s (13:48 - 13:53)
way too high for what you&#39;re what you&#39;re (13:50 - 13:56)
getting out of it like even if even if (13:53 - 13:58)
you do get exactly what you want right (13:56 - 14:02)
even if you do hit the extra candy and (13:58 - 14:05)
it&#39;s a flying type and you put in 40 (14:02 - 14:07)
flying 50 it&#39;s 50 candy worth also (14:05 - 14:09)
putting away 40,000 shards and that&#39;s (14:07 - 14:12)
just like a 30% chance at maybe that and (14:09 - 14:14)
you know I don&#39;t know it just doesn&#39;t (14:12 - 14:15)
make (14:14 - 14:18)
I the whales in this game are on another (14:15 - 14:20)
level I know but the rates in this game (14:18 - 14:24)
are weird like just the way that they (14:20 - 14:27)
Factor how you pay for things in this (14:24 - 14:31)
game is very weird to (14:27 - 14:31)
me yeah (14:31 - 14:37)
uh I think though also like playing this (14:34 - 14:41)
game for so long it&#39;s almost been a year (14:37 - 14:45)
and and I saw somebody mention this (14:41 - 14:47)
and I guess I guess this is more (14:45 - 14:51)
speculation but next month is the year (14:47 - 14:54)
anniversary MH and if you look at raicho (14:51 - 14:58)
and you look at ente they both happened (14:54 - 15:02)
over a good sleep sleep day M two weeks (14:58 - 15:05)
somewhat always overlapped with good (15:02 - 15:07)
sleep so if suun is supposed to come (15:05 - 15:11)
next month that would overlap with the (15:07 - 15:13)
anniversary because that would be close (15:11 - 15:16)
to good sleep day so now I&#39;m curious is (15:13 - 15:18)
if they&#39;re going to delay (15:16 - 15:21)
suun because our news is there&#39;s a new (15:18 - 15:23)
event but remember for suun there would (15:21 - 15:26)
have to be a water type week what we (15:23 - 15:29)
just had was not water type week it was (15:26 - 15:31)
F Festival Summer Festival week or (15:29 - 15:33)
whatever yeah this was like the comfy (15:31 - 15:36)
event after raicho it was like an event (15:33 - 15:38)
that was just a different event it (15:36 - 15:41)
wasn&#39;t related to ente it wasn&#39;t related (15:38 - 15:43)
to the next legendary Pokemon so there (15:41 - 15:46)
would have to be a water type week uh a (15:43 - 15:49)
week break and then two weeks of suun (15:46 - 15:53)
and if that is July that leaves no space (15:49 - 15:55)
for an anniversary event unless they&#39;re (15:53 - 15:56)
just going to say like that&#39;s the (15:55 - 15:58)
anniversary event which that&#39;s not (15:56 - 15:59)
really a good (15:58 - 16:02)
anniversary like that&#39;s not to say suun (15:59 - 16:03)
is bad like I think everyone&#39;s excited (16:02 - 16:05)
for suun (16:03 - 16:08)
but that doesn&#39;t seem like a good way to (16:05 - 16:10)
celebrate your first year is just to do (16:08 - 16:12)
an event that we&#39;ve had just with a (16:10 - 16:14)
different legendary Pokemon they could (16:12 - 16:16)
just give everyone a really big (16:14 - 16:19)
present yeah but I would love to (16:16 - 16:23)
see yes they could and I&#39;m not against (16:19 - 16:25)
that especially if it&#39;s like five great (16:23 - 16:28)
balls and like rare like that that&#39;s (16:25 - 16:31)
cool but I would like to see a week-long (16:28 - 16:33)
event with like green grass decorated of (16:31 - 16:36)
like a little cake and like little party (16:33 - 16:39)
balloons like I they&#39;ve done such a good (16:36 - 16:42)
job with Christmas and Halloween and uh (16:39 - 16:44)
all of these other events that like this (16:42 - 16:47)
is the game not Pokemon go not Pokemon (16:44 - 16:49)
Masters although Pokemon Master are (16:47 - 16:51)
pretty good at inary events like this is (16:49 - 16:53)
the game that has has been good at like (16:51 - 16:55)
a weeklong event with music and (16:53 - 16:57)
decorations and stuff and I don&#39;t want (16:55 - 17:01)
suun to take that away from me I don&#39;t (16:57 - 17:03)
think suun is going to take that away (17:01 - 17:05)
from you I actually do think that they (17:03 - 17:08)
would delay suun and have like an (17:05 - 17:10)
anniversary event honestly like I I (17:08 - 17:12)
don&#39;t see there there&#39;s there&#39;s nothing (17:10 - 17:14)
to say that they wouldn&#39;t I mean just (17:12 - 17:17)
because ente came a month after raicho (17:14 - 17:18)
doesn&#39;t mean suun has to come a month (17:17 - 17:20)
after ente it&#39;ll probably be the next (17:18 - 17:22)
one of course but it doesn&#39;t mean it has (17:20 - 17:25)
to be July it could be August yeah yeah (17:22 - 17:26)
and they probably don&#39;t want to set a (17:25 - 17:29)
president precedent for a new legendary (17:26 - 17:32)
coming out every month mhm I would (17:29 - 17:35)
imagine (17:32 - 17:37)
right yeah yeah I don&#39;t know what would (17:35 - 17:38)
be (17:37 - 17:42)
a like a good anniversary Pokemon or (17:38 - 17:44)
whatever if that&#39;s a thing that wouldn&#39;t (17:42 - 17:46)
be a legendary because I can&#39;t I can&#39;t (17:44 - 17:48)
imagine they would be like ah here&#39;s (17:46 - 17:50)
Articuno all of a sudden and then we&#39;ll (17:48 - 17:51)
go to suun like I don&#39;t think that would (17:50 - 17:53)
happen I would I think what would (17:51 - 17:54)
actually (17:53 - 17:59)
be hype would be if they added another (17:54 - 18:03)
starter Trio like Mudkip Trio (17:59 - 18:05)
Torchic and say like these three (18:03 - 18:07)
starters are coming for the anniversary (18:05 - 18:09)
they&#39;ll all be on green grass after (18:07 - 18:11)
green grass you know Mudkip will be on (18:09 - 18:14)
the beach and Trio will (18:11 - 18:18)
be wherever Trio would be I&#39;m not sure (18:14 - 18:19)
actually maybe (18:18 - 18:22)
lapis maybe lapis lap but I think I (18:19 - 18:25)
think starters are always as powerful as (18:22 - 18:28)
legendaries when it comes to attracting (18:25 - 18:30)
people to (18:28 - 18:31)
a game they (18:30 - 18:34)
are but I also wouldn&#39;t be surprised if (18:31 - 18:36)
it&#39;s just a party hat Pikachu I&#39;m I&#39;m (18:34 - 18:38)
good with that (18:36 - 18:42)
too good with I&#39;m all right with that as (18:38 - 18:45)
well we&#39;ve had hat Pikachus in this game (18:42 - 18:48)
before so I figure that is a a thing we (18:45 - 18:50)
could definitely potentially expect are (18:48 - 18:52)
they are the Hat Pikachu any different (18:50 - 18:55)
than regular Pikachu or is it just like (18:52 - 19:00)
in go they they they cannot evolve yeah (18:55 - 19:02)
but they&#39;re like slightly better than (19:00 - 19:05)
normal Pikachu but because Raichu exists (19:02 - 19:07)
they&#39;re not as good as (19:05 - 19:11)
Raichu sounds awful like I think the the (19:07 - 19:13)
Santa hat Pikachu has their main skills (19:11 - 19:15)
are different so Santa had Pikachu&#39;s (19:13 - 19:17)
main skill is like dream Shard or (19:15 - 19:19)
whatever it&#39;s like the same as Meowth (19:17 - 19:20)
well it&#39;s not better what are you (19:19 - 19:22)
talking about that one&#39;s not better no (19:20 - 19:23)
that one&#39;s not better I think the (19:22 - 19:25)
Halloween one is good but I can&#39;t (19:23 - 19:26)
remember what that one is off the top of (19:25 - 19:27)
my (19:26 - 19:31)
head that should be witch hat Pikachu is (19:27 - 19:33)
pretty decent but also like when you (19:31 - 19:36)
think of the electric event witch hat (19:33 - 19:38)
Pikachu was different than regular (19:36 - 19:39)
Pikachu so if you were trying to get (19:38 - 19:41)
like five electric Pokemon yeah you (19:39 - 19:44)
could have witch hat and regular Pikachu (19:41 - 19:45)
and that would (19:44 - 19:49)
work yeah witch hat Pikachu is only very (19:45 - 19:51)
slightly different it has the other type (19:49 - 19:53)
of charge (19:51 - 19:54)
strength (19:53 - 19:57)
so instead of having charge strength (19:54 - 19:59)
instead of the range it (19:57 - 20:03)
it&#39;s the from 200 to 800 okay right they (19:59 - 20:05)
could have Pikachu with ingredient (20:03 - 20:07)
finder that would be pretty (20:05 - 20:11)
cool I was to say how you like Halloween (20:07 - 20:13)
Pikachu would have been good to have (20:11 - 20:15)
with ingredient finder like finding kaca (20:13 - 20:17)
like finding chocolate Halloween yeah uh (20:15 - 20:20)
but anyways um maybe for the year (20:17 - 20:23)
anniversary they will buff pseudo wo and (20:20 - 20:25)
and woba Fett (20:23 - 20:28)
and every dream Shard finder Pokemon (20:25 - 20:31)
they do something woba (20:28 - 20:33)
Fett uh I think it could hold like plus (20:31 - 20:35)
two more ingredients or something okay (20:33 - 20:39)
great yeah it was like so much better (20:35 - 20:41)
totally maybe yeah maybe the anniversary (20:39 - 20:42)
will make Riolu (20:41 - 20:45)
good just just give him a gift it&#39;s a (20:42 - 20:48)
real uphill battle on (20:45 - 20:51)
rolu uh there is a new event (20:48 - 20:56)
coming uh Pokemon growth week which (20:51 - 21:01)
is it&#39;s an event that&#39;s for sure (20:56 - 21:01)
it&#39;s more than nothing it&#39;s true so soon (21:01 - 21:07)
uh sleep well to grow well it&#39;s time for (21:05 - 21:09)
Pokemon growth week this weekl long (21:07 - 21:11)
event is a special opportunity to get (21:09 - 21:14)
more sleep XP and Candy than usual let&#39;s (21:11 - 21:16)
all try to get plenty of sleep to raise (21:14 - 21:18)
our favorite helper Pokemon from Monday (21:16 - 21:22)
July 1st through Monday July 8th in all (21:18 - 21:25)
areas taupe Hollow finally included in (21:22 - 21:29)
an event uh helper sleep Pokemon will (21:25 - 21:32)
get uh helper Pokemon sleep XP will go (21:29 - 21:35)
up by 1.5% and then Candy&#39;s gain from (21:32 - 21:40)
the first sleep research of the day is (21:35 - 21:40)
1.5 I think I think people calculated (21:40 - 21:47)
this out and it was not that much extra (21:43 - 21:50)
XP and it was (21:47 - 21:55)
like 16 extra free candy per Pokemon you (21:50 - 21:58)
pick assuming you use them all week uh (21:55 - 22:00)
which is is better than nothing but it (21:58 - 22:02)
seems like a (22:00 - 22:06)
very lackluster (22:02 - 22:06)
event (22:10 - 22:15)
[Laughter] (22:11 - 22:19)
yep I guess my only advice would be the (22:15 - 22:21)
entire week run a Pokemon (22:19 - 22:26)
with sleep XP as well because that will (22:21 - 22:30)
stack so I guess like (22:26 - 22:33)
take advantage of it I mean have they (22:30 - 22:36)
done this grow incense also Stacks it (22:33 - 22:39)
looks like so in okay it&#39;s a pretty good (22:36 - 22:41)
use for that incense if you have some (22:39 - 22:42)
that you never (22:41 - 22:45)
use yeah I mean the ones that are hard (22:42 - 22:47)
to level up are (22:45 - 22:49)
like dragon air (22:47 - 22:52)
and uh (22:49 - 22:54)
Larvitar but I don&#39;t think this is going (22:52 - 22:56)
to give you enough (22:54 - 22:59)
experience that that matters but let&#39;s I (22:56 - 23:02)
said I I I&#39;m personally going to run (22:59 - 23:04)
like just Pokemon that has the gold (23:02 - 23:08)
skill sleep XP and just might as well (23:04 - 23:10)
boost the 1.5 even more and just take (23:08 - 23:11)
advantage of it there&#39;s nothing else (23:10 - 23:13)
happening this week (23:11 - 23:16)
so might as (23:13 - 23:18)
well like it&#39;s it&#39;s not like I need to (23:16 - 23:22)
level up anything else well I think this (23:18 - 23:24)
is helpful for people who are later to (23:22 - 23:26)
start though right I mean like me for (23:24 - 23:29)
instance I I mean there isn&#39;t any (23:26 - 23:31)
anything I&#39;m I guess there are a couple (23:29 - 23:32)
Pokemon that I would like to level up (23:31 - 23:35)
but uh you know I don&#39;t have things like (23:32 - 23:37)
dragon air or like I guess I have (23:35 - 23:39)
Larvitar but um so I&#39;m not even trying (23:37 - 23:42)
to like really level up those super high (23:39 - 23:44)
ones but there are other Pokemon like I (23:42 - 23:45)
don&#39;t have that many Pokemon like at (23:44 - 23:48)
level 30 so there&#39;s a lot of like second (23:45 - 23:50)
ingredient stuff I haven&#39;t unlocked like (23:48 - 23:52)
I don&#39;t have anything with potato I (23:50 - 23:53)
don&#39;t have anything with mushroom I (23:52 - 23:56)
don&#39;t have anything with Slowpoke tail (23:53 - 23:58)
um so there are definitely Pokemon that (23:56 - 24:00)
aren&#39;t aren&#39;t super hard to level but (23:58 - 24:02)
like I just haven&#39;t had the chance to (24:00 - 24:04)
get them there and you know something (24:02 - 24:07)
like this I think is helpful uh but yeah (24:04 - 24:09)
if you&#39;ve got everything leveled pretty (24:07 - 24:11)
well already I mean it&#39;s going to be a (24:09 - 24:13)
bit tougher unless you&#39;re just choosing (24:11 - 24:17)
new stuff to level up I guess um yeah (24:13 - 24:20)
like I don&#39;t know you&#39;re very finding (24:17 - 24:22)
Toto di or something I don&#39;t (24:20 - 24:25)
know other things you can level I guess (24:22 - 24:27)
have they done before I think they&#39;ve (24:25 - 24:29)
done it once before (24:27 - 24:31)
okay and I think they&#39;re increasing the (24:29 - 24:33)
frequency of events I feel like they may (24:31 - 24:35)
be seeing the people play more when (24:33 - 24:38)
there is an event going on mhm because (24:35 - 24:40)
at the beginning there weren&#39;t quite as (24:38 - 24:43)
many yeah and not every event has to be (24:40 - 24:45)
like amazing like Pokemon go runs into (24:43 - 24:47)
this problem too (24:45 - 24:49)
where like sometimes there just a week (24:47 - 24:51)
of nothing and that&#39;s okay cuz like I&#39;m (24:49 - 24:53)
like great I don&#39;t have to play this (24:51 - 24:55)
game this week yeah well this week&#39;s (24:53 - 24:59)
event is exactly that the scorching (24:55 - 25:01)
event with the hatching eggs exactly (24:59 - 25:04)
that so it&#39;s perfect yeah (25:01 - 25:07)
exactly um but now that karan&#39;s leaving (25:04 - 25:09)
I guess I&#39;m going to go to Tundra (25:07 - 25:11)
because I haven&#39;t had a reason to go to (25:09 - 25:14)
Tundra and crar an&#39;s (25:11 - 25:17)
there and my lapis is at like (25:14 - 25:20)
40% and my green grass is at 60 and my (25:17 - 25:23)
beach is at 60 and my topalo which I (25:20 - 25:26)
wouldn&#39;t go to anyways is that like 40 (25:23 - 25:29)
that&#39;s unfortunate that topalo has the (25:26 - 25:31)
best music in the entire game but it&#39;s (25:29 - 25:34)
just I tired of topollo I don&#39;t need any (25:31 - 25:37)
more Kow gunks or riolu&#39;s don&#39;t (25:34 - 25:40)
need don&#39;t need them that&#39;s fair that&#39;s (25:37 - 25:44)
fair um I&#39;ve finally got a decent team (25:40 - 25:47)
together for beach so I&#39;m just going to (25:44 - 25:50)
stick at cion beach I don&#39;t have the (25:47 - 25:53)
percentage that High and um after (25:50 - 25:56)
getting the crar an plus I finally got (25:53 - 25:59)
like a good Wiggly tough up and then (25:56 - 26:00)
now so it&#39;s like I finally have some (25:59 - 26:02)
Pokemon that have that actually have (26:00 - 26:05)
like snorlax&#39;s favorite berries on C so (26:02 - 26:06)
I think I&#39;ll probably just stick with (26:05 - 26:08)
beach for a while and because I don&#39;t (26:06 - 26:10)
really feel like going I have snow drop (26:08 - 26:13)
but I I just feel like I want to get a (26:10 - 26:16)
little bit leveled up before I go (26:13 - 26:19)
there yeah I probably should focus on (26:16 - 26:22)
leveling in that way too but I think I&#39;m (26:19 - 26:24)
going to go back to lapis because I (26:22 - 26:26)
think I&#39;ve forgot to mention during the (26:24 - 26:30)
ente event I finally unlocked lapis nice (26:26 - 26:33)
so I&#39;ve gone there once so far and would (26:30 - 26:37)
like to go back it&#39;s it&#39;s a nice (26:33 - 26:40)
place good music good music good music (26:37 - 26:43)
nice (26:40 - 26:47)
yes it&#39;s a nice place uh okay the (26:43 - 26:51)
Pokemon TCG trick or trade booster (26:47 - 26:54)
bundle has been announced on Pokemon (26:51 - 26:57)
Center uh you can pre-order it purchase (26:54 - 26:59)
limit of 12 (26:57 - 27:01)
I just want to point out we&#39;re recording (26:59 - 27:03)
this on June (27:01 - 27:08)
23rd but the 2024 trick or trade booster (27:03 - 27:11)
bundle is available for (27:08 - 27:14)
pre-order I think they made them pretty (27:11 - 27:15)
I think they made them available pretty (27:14 - 27:19)
early last year too yeah yeah uh they (27:15 - 27:21)
said they are expected to ship late (27:19 - 27:25)
August and they will come with 35 mini (27:21 - 27:27)
packs of TCG cards each Mini pack (27:25 - 27:30)
contains three cards this is the third (27:27 - 27:33)
year I think they&#39;ve done this yep um (27:30 - 27:34)
and there is no complaints I think this (27:33 - 27:36)
is great I think this is a cool thing to (27:34 - 27:39)
hand out for Halloween it is I think in (27:36 - 27:41)
a lot of aspects cheaper than candy at (27:39 - 27:43)
this point because of in because of (27:41 - 27:45)
corporate I&#39;m not going to say inflation (27:43 - 27:46)
it&#39;s because of corporate (27:45 - 27:49)
[Laughter] (27:46 - 27:53)
greed yeah um and if you are on the (27:49 - 27:54)
collector side of this because I know (27:53 - 27:57)
there are people who do buy them to try (27:54 - 27:59)
to collect the set usually you can (27:57 - 28:02)
collect the set with within one to two (27:59 - 28:05)
bags so when it says maximum of 12 you (28:02 - 28:07)
don&#39;t need to go and buy 12 bags to (28:05 - 28:09)
collect the set I think you can probably (28:07 - 28:11)
do it in like one or two bags yeah I (28:09 - 28:13)
would say almost guaranteed in one (28:11 - 28:15)
they&#39;re pretty small sets so it gets (28:13 - 28:17)
pretty repetitive opening the packs they (28:15 - 28:20)
are not really for one person to open (28:17 - 28:23)
but they are very fun every once in a (28:20 - 28:25)
while I still just pull one out and open (28:23 - 28:26)
it up just to just to get that little (28:25 - 28:30)
rush of opening up Pokemon cards (28:26 - 28:31)
yeah yeah it&#39;s one uh one of the cooler (28:30 - 28:32)
things they&#39;ve done I&#39;m actually (28:31 - 28:36)
surprised other companies (28:32 - 28:36)
haven&#39;t like you see a bunch of candy (28:36 - 28:40)
companies doing stuff for Halloween but (28:38 - 28:41)
I&#39;m actually surprised you don&#39;t see (28:40 - 28:45)
like a funco or a Disney or maybe maybe (28:41 - 28:47)
there are but like I when I think of (28:45 - 28:51)
that stuff I just think of candy yeah or (28:47 - 28:53)
like dentist is handing out (28:51 - 28:55)
toothbrushes how many dentist office do (28:53 - 28:58)
you go to for Halloween Steve you (28:55 - 29:01)
toothbrush when you&#39;ve been (28:58 - 29:03)

also fruit&#39;s like way more expensive (29:28 - 29:34)
than candy yep that was also a while ago (29:31 - 29:37)
though so maybe it was different 10 15 (29:34 - 29:39)
years ago have you ever gotten like (29:37 - 29:41)
pennies I like an old lady would give (29:39 - 29:44)
like five pennies to each person yeah (29:41 - 29:47)
yeah that&#39;s yep how about (29:44 - 29:50)
rulers r no I&#39;ve never gotten a ruler (29:47 - 29:52)
yeah teacher giv her rulers or something (29:50 - 29:54)
I got like a box of crayons once like (29:52 - 29:56)
like the like 10 pack like the small (29:54 - 29:59)
pack of crayons pretty good nice (29:56 - 30:00)
the really good ones are the houses that (29:59 - 30:03)
give out the big the big oh yeah candy (30:00 - 30:04)
bars yeah when you get the king-size (30:03 - 30:05)

sharable candy bar yeah the sharable (30:05 - 30:10)
candy yeah those are the those are the (30:08 - 30:12)
best house those are the ones where you (30:10 - 30:15)
switch your costume to go back a second (30:12 - 30:15)
time all right uh okay let&#39;s take a (30:17 - 30:21)
break and we come back we&#39;ll talk about (30:20 - 30:25)
this AR AI art thing so we will be right (30:21 - 30:29)
back and we are back from our break (30:25 - 30:34)
uh okay so every year Pokemon does this (30:29 - 30:36)
art (30:34 - 30:40)
contest where you can that it&#39;s it&#39;s (30:36 - 30:42)
usually six different Pokemon they pick (30:40 - 30:46)
almost always Charizard always (30:42 - 30:49)
Pikachu it&#39;s called the illustration (30:46 - 30:51)
contest (30:49 - 30:54)
and you could have submitted between (30:51 - 30:58)
October 12th 2023 and January 31st 202 (30:54 - 31:02)
four and then they will pick 300 (30:58 - 31:04)
winners I don&#39;t actually remember what (31:02 - 31:07)
you get for winning but then from those (31:04 - 31:10)
300 they will pick (31:07 - 31:15)
another three winners in each card (31:10 - 31:22)
category um so this year there was uh (31:15 - 31:24)
Absol oh I have to scroll through all (31:22 - 31:26)
these Absol uh (31:24 - 31:30)
Eevee uh for alligator (31:26 - 31:30)
uh (31:30 - 31:35)
coridon (31:32 - 31:35)
toxcity and Pikachu (31:35 - 31:41)
beof lot of bofs (31:38 - 31:45)
Flygon melmetal didn&#39;t you say six Char (31:41 - 31:48)
yeah they did a lot this year Charizard (31:45 - 31:51)
pretty sure last year it was exactly six (31:48 - 31:52)
we cover this every year and I feel like (31:51 - 31:54)
they they did a lot more Pokemon this (31:52 - 31:57)
year crazy um so th those are the (31:54 - 31:59)
Pokemon you could draw (31:57 - 32:02)
for there are there&#39;s also a bunch of (31:59 - 32:05)
other rules where you could only submit (32:02 - 32:09)
two entries per your name uh you could (32:05 - 32:12)
also not submit art that has already (32:09 - 32:15)
been out there in the world there has (32:12 - 32:18)
been issues with that before um actually (32:15 - 32:19)
I&#39;ll talk about that issue because I (32:18 - 32:22)
might forget there was an art contest (32:19 - 32:26)
for sword and shield where you could (32:22 - 32:28)
design a a shirt for sword and shield (32:26 - 32:30)
and if you won it would be in the game (32:28 - 32:32)
and it would be accessible to everyone (32:30 - 32:34)
through a mystery gift through digital (32:32 - 32:36)
download and they got however many (32:34 - 32:39)
entries and the shirt that won ended up (32:36 - 32:41)
being like a Magikarp Gyarados shirt it (32:39 - 32:44)
was really cool and they found out that (32:41 - 32:48)
the artist actually published that (32:44 - 32:51)
artwork prior to the event and then (32:48 - 32:54)
deleted it once the event started cuz (32:51 - 32:56)
they wanted to submit it to the event (32:54 - 32:59)
and then what ended up happening is (32:56 - 33:01)
when the shirt (32:59 - 33:03)
won (33:01 - 33:05)
people somehow found out that hey this (33:03 - 33:09)
was already posted and also a couple (33:05 - 33:12)
factories in China decided to put those (33:09 - 33:15)
on the back of like iPhone cases and (33:12 - 33:17)
started selling those on like red bubble (33:15 - 33:18)
for like (33:17 - 33:21)
$5 and so the Pokemon company ended up (33:18 - 33:24)
canceling that whole contests the second (33:21 - 33:26)
place person didn&#39;t get anything like it (33:24 - 33:28)
wasn&#39;t like oh we disqualified the first (33:26 - 33:30)
place person so we&#39;ll we&#39;ll move up to (33:28 - 33:31)
Second Place person like nope that (33:30 - 33:33)
didn&#39;t happen there just none of us got (33:31 - 33:34)
shirts we we should have got a free (33:33 - 33:36)
digital cool shirt that an artist made (33:34 - 33:39)
and it didn&#39;t happen and that (33:36 - 33:41)
scenario right there is part of the (33:39 - 33:43)
reason why I hate this art illustration (33:41 - 33:45)
contest every year because like no one (33:43 - 33:48)
wins ever (33:45 - 33:52)
like like I still feel so bad for the (33:48 - 33:54)
second place person who followed all the (33:52 - 33:57)
rules did everything right the fir first (33:54 - 34:00)
place person got disqualified and the (33:57 - 34:01)
second place person got nothing they (34:00 - 34:02)
were just like yep we&#39;re canceling the (34:01 - 34:04)
whole thing and then us as people that (34:02 - 34:06)
are like oh we love Pokemon fan art we (34:04 - 34:09)
also get nothing um out of this yeah (34:06 - 34:12)
that&#39;s totally true but I will say as (34:09 - 34:14)
far as the illustration contest goes (34:12 - 34:17)
like this one the 2022 illustration (34:14 - 34:19)
contest had three winners right it was (34:17 - 34:22)
like a Bulbasaur Greninja and a Arcanine (34:19 - 34:24)
I think yes I know the Greninja for sure (34:22 - 34:27)
because that artist is is now (34:24 - 34:30)
Illustrated another card that&#39;s coming (34:27 - 34:33)
out in the the next set so I think (34:30 - 34:35)
that&#39;s pretty cool like it&#39;s like that (34:33 - 34:38)
person is now there&#39;s like a Houndoom (34:35 - 34:40)
illustration rare coming out in the next (34:38 - 34:41)
set and that it&#39;s the same person who (34:40 - 34:44)
won who did the Greninja from the (34:41 - 34:48)
2022 illustration contest so I do think (34:44 - 34:50)
it&#39;s cool that like that person ended up (34:48 - 34:52)
going on and like illustrating another (34:50 - 34:55)
card uh and who knows will maybe (34:52 - 34:56)
illustrate more down the road who knows (34:55 - 34:58)
but just the fact that it wasn&#39;t just (34:56 - 35:00)
the one win and then they were never (34:58 - 35:02)
heard from again from the Pokemon (35:00 - 35:06)
company uh but not to say that there&#39;s (35:02 - 35:08)
not a lot of negatives out there just (35:06 - 35:09)
it&#39;s just one thing that I that I (35:08 - 35:10)
noticed the other day when they when I (35:09 - 35:14)
was seeing stuff coming out (35:10 - 35:17)
soon uh so (35:14 - 35:20)
10,830 people entered the (35:17 - 35:22)
2024 art (35:20 - 35:27)
contest they have done round one top 300 (35:22 - 35:29)
I think they will then bring the down to (35:27 - 35:31)
I think round two brings it down to like (35:29 - 35:33)
six of each or something like that or 10 (35:31 - 35:35)
of each they&#39;ll they&#39;ll start (35:33 - 35:38)
eliminating and and bring it down but (35:35 - 35:40)
there&#39;s there&#39;s the the overview of like (35:38 - 35:44)
what this is now (35:40 - 35:47)
um where is my (35:44 - 35:50)
link oh I have the I have the I have the (35:47 - 35:52)
wrong I have the wrong Link in our show (35:50 - 35:57)
notes um so the problem here is uh (35:52 - 36:00)
that now that the top 300 are out (35:57 - 36:02)
artists can be like this was my art that (36:00 - 36:03)
I submitted and it didn&#39;t make it and (36:02 - 36:05)
that&#39;s a bummer um and then you see a (36:03 - 36:07)
lot of really good art because I think (36:05 - 36:10)
karant was 2023 or (36:07 - 36:12)
2022 and there was like a lot a lot of (36:10 - 36:15)
really really good karant art also just (36:12 - 36:17)
side note if you go to like (36:15 - 36:20)
Bulbapedia you can like Bulbapedia (36:17 - 36:23)
documents all the people in the art (36:20 - 36:27)
contest that like made it mhm so like I (36:23 - 36:28)
don&#39;t know where you would go to see (36:27 - 36:30)
that art so if you wanted to see like (36:28 - 36:32)
all that Karan art or all the old (36:30 - 36:33)
Pikachu art or whatever that were like (36:32 - 36:36)
top 300 almost made it um bub pia has (36:33 - 36:38)
like a whole section on their on their (36:36 - 36:42)
Wiki of (36:38 - 36:45)
past win winners I don&#39;t know like you (36:42 - 36:48)
you definitely made it if you&#39;re top 300 (36:45 - 36:49)
for sure like that&#39;s a huge (36:48 - 36:50)
accomplishment I don&#39;t know what that (36:49 - 36:53)
looks like on a an art portfolio or an (36:50 - 36:55)
art resume but I I I don&#39;t think that&#39;s (36:53 - 36:58)
for nothing yeah that&#39;s I mean out of (36:55 - 37:01)
10,000 there are 10,000 applicants like (36:58 - 37:04)
top 300 is I would say pretty (37:01 - 37:10)
good um yeah so the camar was in 2022 um (37:04 - 37:11)
you can literally just like if you like (37:10 - 37:13)
Google like Bulbapedia illustration (37:11 - 37:15)
contests there&#39;s a bunch on the bul on (37:13 - 37:17)
Bulbapedia um but you can go click right (37:15 - 37:21)
into the specific one for like 2022 or (37:17 - 37:23)
2024 and then yeah you can just scroll (37:21 - 37:26)
through and it just shows you all of the (37:23 - 37:29)
all of the top 300 artworks in there are (37:26 - 37:31)
this is from 2022 that I&#39;m looking at (37:29 - 37:34)
but so many beautiful I&#39;m so envious of (37:31 - 37:38)
people who uh have taken the time and (37:34 - 37:42)
have the talent to draw like this uh (37:38 - 37:45)
because I do not have that Talent nor (37:42 - 37:47)
have I put in that time to try to be (37:45 - 37:49)
able to draw like that but it&#39;s amazing (37:47 - 37:52)
to see what some people uh can (37:49 - 37:58)
do uh this is off uh Sports Illustrated (37:52 - 38:00)
the Pokemon illustration contest (37:58 - 38:02)
returned for 2024 giving chance a giving (38:00 - 38:04)
fans a chance to have their art featured (38:02 - 38:06)
on a trading card the guidelin states (38:04 - 38:09)
that submissions must be standard cards (38:06 - 38:12)
not full art uh not like ex and show a (38:09 - 38:15)
Pokemon in a dynamic pose uh maybe that (38:12 - 38:17)
was inspired by an attacker ability one (38:15 - 38:19)
of the rules state that the artwork must (38:17 - 38:21)
be original uh but that didn&#39;t stop many (38:19 - 38:23)
AI images from sneaking into the top 300 (38:21 - 38:26)
and raging Pokemon fans off the internet (38:23 - 38:29)
on Twitter we&#39;re calling it Twitter the (38:26 - 38:31)
official Pokemon TCG account announced (38:29 - 38:33)
the top 300 quarterfinalists for the (38:31 - 38:36)
illustration contest have been selected (38:33 - 38:39)
and then linked to all the artwork (38:36 - 38:41)
before one user on Twitter pointed out (38:39 - 38:43)
that many of the users were blatantly (38:41 - 38:45)
breaking the contest guidelines by (38:43 - 38:47)
submitting multiple artwork under (38:45 - 38:48)
different names yeah so there&#39;s two (38:47 - 38:50)
issues here uh there&#39;s what I said (38:48 - 38:53)
earlier which is you can only submit (38:50 - 38:56)
two um Pokemon per your name there was (38:53 - 38:58)
somebody that (38:56 - 39:01)
submitted six and got six of their (38:58 - 39:03)
entries into the top 300 and they did (39:01 - 39:06)
not do a very good job at hiding their (39:03 - 39:10)
name at all this would be the vegan K (39:06 - 39:12)
vegan (39:10 - 39:15)
kutan uh vgo K was the three different (39:12 - 39:18)
aliases they used so just VK is what (39:15 - 39:20)
we&#39;ll refer to them (39:18 - 39:25)
as uh but they they got six into the top (39:20 - 39:25)
300 uh and and then those six entries I (39:26 - 39:35)
just named from VK all have signs of (39:31 - 39:37)
[Music] (39:35 - 39:41)
AI adjustments I don&#39;t AI was used in (39:37 - 39:44)
some instances even going as far (39:41 - 39:48)
as that people found that the Vaporeon (39:44 - 39:52)
used in the Eevee art was a Vaporeon (39:48 - 39:54)
stolen from another (39:52 - 39:57)
artist that they found the original art (39:54 - 39:59)
of that Vaporeon that was then put in (39:57 - 40:02)
the background of this (39:59 - 40:02)
Eevee (40:02 - 40:08)
uh players are asking to reconsider all (40:04 - 40:10)
AI images they&#39;re not (40:08 - 40:13)
art uh (40:10 - 40:16)
this I guess there&#39;s this (40:13 - 40:19)
this and I agree with the vocal (40:16 - 40:21)
community (40:19 - 40:24)
of like going through and banning the AI (40:21 - 40:26)
art or like admitting that they messed (40:24 - 40:28)
up and and that they&#39;re going to re go (40:26 - 40:31)
through the entries (40:28 - 40:31)
again it doesn&#39;t feel like they went (40:32 - 40:37)
through the entries very well at all I (40:35 - 40:39)
mean again this is it&#39;s not even like (40:37 - 40:42)
just set aside the AI for a second and (40:39 - 40:45)
this person clearly submitted six (40:42 - 40:47)
different I feel like you narrow it down (40:45 - 40:51)
to 300 you look at those 300 and go huh (40:47 - 40:53)
those six have like very similar names (40:51 - 40:55)
maybe we should look a little further (40:53 - 40:57)
into the fact that there are six images (40:55 - 41:00)
in the top 300 with very similar names (40:57 - 41:02)
and it&#39;s possible could be a popular (41:00 - 41:04)
name could be you know so it&#39;s like it (41:02 - 41:08)
just deserves you know an extra step of (41:04 - 41:11)
really looking into that uh before you (41:08 - 41:13)
even get to the AI portion of it uh and (41:11 - 41:17)
I do believe I also heard that there was (41:13 - 41:18)
something about maybe one of these (41:17 - 41:20)
images or a different image that had (41:18 - 41:22)
also been previously used so we&#39;re (41:20 - 41:24)
talking like three different rules (41:22 - 41:28)
having been broken from cards in or (41:24 - 41:32)
images in the top 300 there uh and and (41:28 - 41:36)
also to be clear VK the the six that are (41:32 - 41:38)
going around the most are not the only (41:36 - 41:42)
ones accused of a those are just the the (41:38 - 41:44)
primary ones because because they (41:42 - 41:48)
submitted six entries submitted (41:44 - 41:50)
six yeah and but I think that&#39;s a good (41:48 - 41:52)
example (41:50 - 41:55)
of I&#39;m I&#39;m not (41:52 - 41:59)
like I would assume a bunch of artists (41:55 - 42:03)
are looking at the art to make it in the (41:59 - 42:05)
top 300 like we don&#39;t know what the (42:03 - 42:07)
judging panel is like like who is (42:05 - 42:09)
looking at the art how did they make it (42:07 - 42:11)
into the top 300 (42:09 - 42:15)
are certain artists at the Pokemon (42:11 - 42:17)
company or at creatures or wherever (42:15 - 42:19)
they&#39;re doing this are they only looking (42:17 - 42:22)
at a specific Pokemon are they broken up (42:19 - 42:23)
into like hey you look at these a (42:22 - 42:25)
thousand I&#39;ll look at these a th you (42:23 - 42:27)
look at those a thousand there&#39;s a lot (42:25 - 42:29)
of entries 10,000 entries that you go (42:27 - 42:31)
through and you have to bring it down to (42:29 - 42:35)
300 so not to let them off the hook (42:31 - 42:37)
because there but there&#39;s a lot to look (42:35 - 42:41)
at I think once you put the six V go vks (42:37 - 42:43)
together and then you see that one has (42:41 - 42:46)
like really weird AI stuff it&#39;s then (42:43 - 42:48)
very easy to look at the other five (42:46 - 42:49)
because they&#39;re all right next to each (42:48 - 42:50)
other so that&#39;s why I think people are (42:49 - 42:54)
using VK as a really good example I&#39;m (42:50 - 42:57)
assuming and this is just assuming with (42:54 - 42:59)
good intent that when they were going (42:57 - 43:02)
through they didn&#39;t see all six vks in a (42:59 - 43:06)
row right sure cuz if you saw like if (43:02 - 43:08)
you saw like vegan within the first 100 (43:06 - 43:10)
and then you&#39;re you&#39;re 5,000 in and you (43:08 - 43:12)
see a vgo you&#39;re not even thinking about (43:10 - 43:15)
that vegan anymore sure maybe not when (43:12 - 43:17)
choosing them initially but once you get (43:15 - 43:19)
it narrowed down to the 300 presumably (43:17 - 43:21)
somebody is going through that list of (43:19 - 43:25)
300 before deciding that&#39;s the final 300 (43:21 - 43:28)
I mean I feel like there should be a few (43:25 - 43:30)
people going through that list of 300 if (43:28 - 43:33)
you&#39;re like if there are 10,000 entries (43:30 - 43:34)
and I&#39;m assuming there&#39;s more than one (43:33 - 43:36)
person reviewing 10,000 entries so let&#39;s (43:34 - 43:38)
say there are three or four I would hope (43:36 - 43:40)
so art is so subjective I would hope (43:38 - 43:42)
that more than one person iswing so (43:40 - 43:44)
let&#39;s say even 10 people are reviewing (43:42 - 43:46)
10,000 entries that&#39;s a th per person (43:44 - 43:48)
right let&#39;s just say it&#39;s a th000 per (43:46 - 43:51)
person then after all of that getting it (43:48 - 43:53)
down to 300 reviewing (43:51 - 43:56)
300 you should be able to you know (43:53 - 43:57)
multiple people should be able to do (43:56 - 43:58)
that (43:57 - 43:59)
almost together or separately and then (43:58 - 44:01)
they come together with their notes of (43:59 - 44:02)
like well this is what I found this is (44:01 - 44:05)
what I found and you know and it it just (44:02 - 44:07)
feels like sure it&#39;s easy for us to look (44:05 - 44:09)
at this like you said when we see them (44:07 - 44:11)
all six of them sitting together but (44:09 - 44:14)
even at 300 and seeing six of them I (44:11 - 44:16)
feel like that should have been that (44:14 - 44:18)
should have been caught it just I mean (44:16 - 44:20)
it I definitely feel like it should have (44:18 - 44:23)
been because most of them are Eevees so (44:20 - 44:24)
they all would have been right next to (44:23 - 44:26)
each (44:24 - 44:29)
other yeah for of vks or EES and then (44:26 - 44:30)
two are (44:29 - 44:33)
Pikachu and from there&#39;s like multiple (44:30 - 44:36)
threads on this uh like I retweeted a (44:33 - 44:38)
thread on my personal Twitter of uh (44:36 - 44:42)
their name is stormy and they&#39;re they&#39;re (44:38 - 44:44)
an artist and they&#39;ve done AI they it&#39;s (44:42 - 44:45)
a huge huge thread and I think it&#39;s (44:44 - 44:47)
really good it&#39;s also linked in the (44:45 - 44:48)
Sports Illustrated article that&#39;ll be in (44:47 - 44:49)
the show notes if you want to read (44:48 - 44:53)
through it but if you don&#39;t do art at (44:49 - 44:56)
all it would make sense how you could (44:53 - 44:58)
miss this (44:56 - 44:59)
like if you&#39;re not an artist if you&#39;ve (44:58 - 45:02)
never used Photoshop or procreate or any (44:59 - 45:04)
of this stuff because you you&#39;re looking (45:02 - 45:05)
for specific things you&#39;re looking for (45:04 - 45:07)
lines that don&#39;t make sense you&#39;re (45:05 - 45:08)
looking for flower shapes that don&#39;t (45:07 - 45:11)
make sense you question like why did you (45:08 - 45:13)
draw something this way uh and of course (45:11 - 45:15)
some people are bad at drawing certain (45:13 - 45:16)
things some people might be bad at (45:15 - 45:18)
drawing feet some people might be bad at (45:16 - 45:21)
drawing faces or bad at drawing um (45:18 - 45:22)
certain (45:21 - 45:25)
stances but it&#39;s interesting for (45:22 - 45:28)
somebody who is not like an illustrator (45:25 - 45:32)
or an artist in the sense of drawing (45:28 - 45:34)
creatures artist is a really big (45:32 - 45:37)
umbrella term um that once you start (45:34 - 45:39)
once people start pointing out stuff (45:37 - 45:41)
then you&#39;re like oh I I didn&#39;t even (45:39 - 45:43)
consider (45:41 - 45:46)
that which takes me back to the judges (45:43 - 45:48)
or whoever&#39;s in charge of getting this (45:46 - 45:50)
down to (45:48 - 45:50)
300 are they just not familiar with AI (45:51 - 45:57)
art were they not the actual art were (45:54 - 46:00)
they somebody else just in charge of (45:57 - 46:02)
like narrowing down this list to then (46:00 - 46:05)
pass down to the artist like whatever (46:02 - 46:08)
their structure of judging was needs to (46:05 - 46:09)
be completely re (46:08 - 46:11)
re-evaluated uh (46:09 - 46:15)
because going through a a 10,000 entries (46:11 - 46:18)
is a a lot and like keep in mind that (46:15 - 46:20)
that&#39;s 10,000 entries each of those (46:18 - 46:22)
entries could submit at least two pieces (46:20 - 46:25)
of art so minimum they were looking at (46:22 - 46:27)
anywhere between 10,000 to 20,000 pieces (46:25 - 46:30)
of art to then get it down to (46:27 - 46:35)
300 how one dude got six entries (46:30 - 46:38)
submitted there must be somebody there (46:35 - 46:40)
must be somebody on that judging panel (46:38 - 46:42)
that just liked that specific style of (46:40 - 46:44)
art a (46:42 - 46:46)
lot (46:44 - 46:49)
right well so have they they haven&#39;t (46:46 - 46:50)
said anything about this right said (46:49 - 46:53)
nothing as of recording I guess the (46:50 - 46:54)
question becomes are they gonna say (46:53 - 46:57)
anything about it or is the next round (46:54 - 46:58)
just going to not have these six entries (46:57 - 47:00)
in it right like is the next round just (46:58 - 47:04)
going to have these six eliminated and (47:00 - 47:05)
and then they&#39;re just going to continue (47:04 - 47:09)
on and say nothing but be like well (47:05 - 47:11)
those six got eliminated they didn&#39;t win (47:09 - 47:14)
you know so but they also took up Slots (47:11 - 47:17)
of people who actually oh for sure yes (47:14 - 47:19)
that&#39;s absolutely that is the bigger (47:17 - 47:20)
problem but I just am saying from like (47:19 - 47:23)
the company standpoint is it easier for (47:20 - 47:26)
them to just not say anything but then (47:23 - 47:27)
in the next round just remove well they (47:26 - 47:30)
did say something about the (47:27 - 47:33)
Magikarp the The Magikarp shirt but that (47:30 - 47:35)
was first place yeah they ended the (47:33 - 47:38)
entire it got to the end of the (47:35 - 47:41)
contest to you know yeah that&#39;s true (47:38 - 47:42)
that&#39;s true they made it to the end a (47:41 - 47:43)
little bit different here they could (47:42 - 47:45)
just remove those six at the next round (47:43 - 47:46)
and (47:45 - 47:49)
then not say anything it&#39;s not like they (47:46 - 47:51)
haven&#39;t done things like that before not (47:49 - 47:54)
specifically for AI art but I just mean (47:51 - 47:56)
just kind of I think when you&#39;re an (47:54 - 47:59)
artist and you&#39;re in this field AI art (47:56 - 48:01)
is probably on the front of your mind (47:59 - 48:04)
because you&#39;re dealing with it every day (48:01 - 48:10)
um and when you have a big company like (48:04 - 48:14)
Pokemon get have some AI art slip past (48:10 - 48:18)
and and some is is in this case a lot (48:14 - 48:21)
because out of 20,000 possibly 20,000 (48:18 - 48:23)
different art we at least see more than (48:21 - 48:26)
six because again VK is not the only one (48:23 - 48:28)
that&#39;s accused of AR (48:26 - 48:32)
art but also there&#39;s this fine line of (48:28 - 48:38)
you don&#39;t want to accuse somebody of AI (48:32 - 48:42)
art when it&#39;s not yeah yeah and it is (48:38 - 48:44)
not always easy to tell yeah been seeing (48:42 - 48:47)
that as well but I think VK is a good (48:44 - 48:48)
example (48:47 - 48:51)
of this is for (48:48 - 48:55)
sure AI (48:51 - 48:58)
art in some aspects and again that&#39;s why (48:55 - 49:00)
I&#39;m like maybe go look at stormy&#39;s (48:58 - 49:03)
thread of like pointing out like there&#39;s (49:00 - 49:06)
no re no artist would draw a flower like (49:03 - 49:09)
this do we&#39;re not even certain though (49:06 - 49:12)
that there are human reviewers reviewing (49:09 - 49:14)
the the ones that get it down to 300 (49:12 - 49:16)
right yeah we (49:14 - 49:20)
havea right so uh because I&#39;m just (49:16 - 49:22)
thinking of completely it&#39;s different (49:20 - 49:24)
but like meta came out with like the (49:22 - 49:27)
made by AI label on things for in (49:24 - 49:29)
Instagram and threads and then started (49:27 - 49:32)
labeling people&#39;s actual work as made (49:29 - 49:34)
with AI and then people were going in to (49:32 - 49:36)
prove like no this isn&#39;t I didn&#39;t use AI (49:34 - 49:38)
to make this like more for like photos (49:36 - 49:41)
and things but yeah and they had to go (49:38 - 49:42)
and were like but I can&#39;t it like (49:41 - 49:44)
automatically labeled it made with AI so (49:42 - 49:46)
now it now they&#39;re confusing things it&#39;s (49:44 - 49:48)
like no this wasn&#39;t AI but now it&#39;s (49:46 - 49:49)
labeled this way it&#39;s like the other way (49:48 - 49:52)
around but it just makes me wonder is (49:49 - 49:54)
there a possibility that there aren&#39;t (49:52 - 49:56)
even human reviewers for the getting it (49:54 - 50:00)
to the 300 and then at the 300 level (49:56 - 50:02)
then maybe they start actually reviewing (50:00 - 50:04)
them with people I feel like that would (50:02 - 50:07)
be insulting um if there weren&#39;t human (50:04 - 50:09)
reviewers getting it down to the 300 (50:07 - 50:11)
getting it getting into the top 300 (50:09 - 50:14)
should be something to be proud of (50:11 - 50:15)
agreed but I&#39;m just wondering I mean (50:14 - 50:18)
like we&#39;ve seen this company get to the (50:15 - 50:20)
end with the Magikarp Gyarados thing and (50:18 - 50:22)
that like it just feel that&#39;s not quite (50:20 - 50:24)
the same thing we have we have the (50:22 - 50:27)
issues of one person submitting (50:24 - 50:29)
more than they should and we have the (50:27 - 50:32)
issue of people using artificial (50:29 - 50:35)
intelligence generated art and the AI (50:32 - 50:39)
art is really not always easy to tell (50:35 - 50:40)
and I feel like if they are still going (50:39 - 50:42)
through with the same process as (50:40 - 50:45)
previous years where AI art wasn&#39;t as (50:42 - 50:48)
big a thing because more people are (50:45 - 50:50)
doing that this year than probably any (50:48 - 50:53)
other previous year ever before they&#39;re (50:50 - 50:54)
probably just using the same checklist (50:53 - 50:57)
they have all those previous years and (50:54 - 51:00)
have not been looking for it they (50:57 - 51:02)
probably just need to have at least one (51:00 - 51:06)
person go through the three the top 300 (51:02 - 51:08)
and specifically be looking for it if (51:06 - 51:11)
they want to even (51:08 - 51:14)
try yeah I just to get those out weird (51:11 - 51:16)
that both of those issues have come up (51:14 - 51:19)
the AI art but also the well it&#39;s not (51:16 - 51:21)
weird that those have both come up (51:19 - 51:23)
together when you don&#39;t have to put as (51:21 - 51:25)
much work into a piece of art you can (51:23 - 51:28)
submit more no but the fact that they (51:25 - 51:30)
got through to the top 300 is what is (51:28 - 51:32)
weird that like reviewers should be I (51:30 - 51:34)
mean maybe they&#39;re not reviewing the AI (51:32 - 51:36)
art but like you&#39;d think that they&#39;d be (51:34 - 51:38)
reviewing if there&#39;s a rule for only (51:36 - 51:40)
submitting two per person you think (51:38 - 51:42)
there would be some sort of more of (51:40 - 51:46)
review on who is submitting and whether (51:42 - 51:47)
that is the same person or not (51:46 - 51:50)
submitting multiple pieces you know I (51:47 - 51:53)
mean I mean I&#39;m sure there are (51:50 - 51:55)
protections for you can only submit with (51:53 - 51:58)
this email you can only submit two (51:55 - 52:00)
pieces with this email and so this (51:58 - 52:01)
person probably just used three (52:00 - 52:03)
different emails or something like that (52:01 - 52:05)
and those are the protections they&#39;ve (52:03 - 52:09)
had so far yeah yeah I guess so I I (52:05 - 52:11)
don&#39;t really understand why this person (52:09 - 52:13)
submitted all of the same Pokemon and (52:11 - 52:15)
names it&#39;s I I I can answer that (52:13 - 52:17)
question those are the only six that (52:15 - 52:18)
made the 300 though could have they (52:17 - 52:20)
could have submitted 50 that&#39;s true and (52:18 - 52:22)
only six made the 300 I mean we&#39;re only (52:20 - 52:24)
looking at 300 they could have submitted (52:22 - 52:27)
a 100 a thousand you know like there&#39;s (52:24 - 52:29)
nothing there&#39;s no way to know that so (52:27 - 52:31)
you know it that&#39;s what I&#39;m saying (52:29 - 52:32)
though is like if you have human (52:31 - 52:35)
reviewers doing that now like it&#39;s worth (52:32 - 52:37)
looking back at the last couple of years (52:35 - 52:40)
like are there were there people who got (52:37 - 52:43)
like four five six eight 10 entries (52:40 - 52:46)
through to the top 300 you know it&#39;s if (52:43 - 52:48)
that check has been that check is not (52:46 - 52:50)
something that would be new that would (52:48 - 52:50)
be something that would have been (52:50 - 52:52)
happening the entire time along versus (52:50 - 52:55)
the AI art would have been different but (52:52 - 52:57)
checking to see if the same person and (52:55 - 52:58)
submitting multiple things I feel like (52:57 - 53:01)
is not would not be new yeah I I I (52:58 - 53:03)
didn&#39;t even consider that point Bobby we (53:01 - 53:07)
see that VK got six entries in but they (53:03 - 53:10)
could have submitted 50 mhm just using (53:07 - 53:13)
different emails right and the going (53:10 - 53:14)
back to like why did they focus on (53:13 - 53:16)
Pikachu and Eevee I that&#39;s a really easy (53:14 - 53:19)
question to answer it&#39;s because AI art (53:16 - 53:21)
needs to pull for something and there (53:19 - 53:24)
are a lot of Pikachu and Eevee artwork (53:21 - 53:26)
out there there&#39;s not a lot of Absol (53:24 - 53:28)
artwork out there there&#39;s not a lot of (53:26 - 53:30)
toxcity artwork out there so if you&#39;re (53:28 - 53:32)
like why did VK just do a bunch of (53:30 - 53:34)
Eevees or a bunch of Pikachus it&#39;s (53:32 - 53:36)
because AI can can figure that out (53:34 - 53:38)
better I&#39;m not saying like perfect but (53:36 - 53:40)
it can figure it out better than a (53:38 - 53:42)
toxitricity because how much toxcity art (53:40 - 53:44)
do you see on a daily Bas that&#39;s not to (53:42 - 53:46)
say toxitricity is not a cool Pokemon it (53:44 - 53:48)
is very cool but Pikachu and Eevee have (53:46 - 53:49)
been around for (53:48 - 53:52)
28 years toxitricity is a better round (53:49 - 53:55)
for six well and that&#39;s not even to say (53:52 - 53:59)
that we didn&#39;t do Absol toxcity I could (53:55 - 54:01)
see them doing a bunch of all of them (53:59 - 54:03)
and then it&#39;s just that Eevee and (54:01 - 54:05)
Pikachu are the ones that made it to the (54:03 - 54:08)
top to the top 300 I I you know it&#39;s (54:05 - 54:10)
you&#39;ll never we&#39;ll never know obviously (54:08 - 54:13)
we&#39;re not seeing all 10,000 entries but (54:10 - 54:16)
I just feel like for to make six make (54:13 - 54:19)
the top 300 I&#39;m almost 100% sure they (54:16 - 54:22)
didn&#39;t only submit six then they just (54:19 - 54:24)
100% made the top 300 I&#39;m pretty sure (54:22 - 54:26)
they submitted a bunch and yeah if (54:24 - 54:28)
you&#39;re if you&#39;re six out of six for a (54:26 - 54:31)
Pokemon contest (54:28 - 54:33)
that&#39;s maybe buy a lottery ticket or (54:31 - 54:36)
something yeah but like when you look at (54:33 - 54:37)
their style of (54:36 - 54:41)
art with the exception of like the Eevee (54:37 - 54:42)
in the in the (54:41 - 54:45)
snow I feel like take that one out but (54:42 - 54:47)
if you look at the other five of vks (54:45 - 54:48)
they have a very they&#39;re all very (54:47 - 54:51)
similar they have like a very distinct (54:48 - 54:54)
style so if I&#39;m thinking (54:51 - 54:58)
like how many people did it take to get (54:54 - 55:02)
10,000 entrance down to 300 pieces of (54:58 - 55:05)
art because at a certain point like do (55:02 - 55:07)
did they just not have enough people (55:05 - 55:11)
looking because I feel (55:07 - 55:11)
like this Jud a a judge was like I (55:11 - 55:18)
really like this style and they approved (55:15 - 55:21)
five (55:18 - 55:21)
of and that&#39;s that&#39;s hard to like I (55:21 - 55:27)
think I think when you look at the art (55:25 - 55:31)
that didn&#39;t make it it&#39;s really (55:27 - 55:34)
frustrating because one the art is (55:31 - 55:37)
incredible and two you can just tell (55:34 - 55:39)
that it&#39;s a completely different style (55:37 - 55:45)
of art yeah um yeah and and artist (55:39 - 55:48)
totally subjective when you have like (55:45 - 55:52)
two judges they might prefer more of a (55:48 - 55:53)
waterc (55:52 - 55:57)
colory uh flowery look versus if you had (55:53 - 56:00)
eight judges now you have somebody who (55:57 - 56:02)
might prefer like thick lines and you (56:00 - 56:03)
might have somebody who prefer like (56:02 - 56:05)
bright colors or you might have somebody (56:03 - 56:09)
that prefers like very simple but still (56:05 - 56:11)
you just you just get more options so (56:09 - 56:12)
again what I&#39;m saying is when I&#39;m (56:11 - 56:16)
looking at VK stuff it just seems like (56:12 - 56:19)
somebody liked that sort of art style (56:16 - 56:21)
which there&#39;s nothing wrong with that (56:19 - 56:23)
but then you look at the stuff that (56:21 - 56:27)
didn&#39;t make it and you&#39;re like how I (56:23 - 56:29)
like that like I love that style and I (56:27 - 56:33)
wish I saw more of that style in the top (56:29 - 56:37)
300 so was there just not that many (56:33 - 56:39)
people trying to get it down to 300 like (56:37 - 56:40)
we have no clue how the judging process (56:39 - 56:43)
works like maybe when it gets to 300 (56:40 - 56:45)
they bring in like actual different (56:43 - 56:48)
artists or maybe when it comes down to (56:45 - 56:51)
the top 10 they&#39;re like we&#39;re bringing (56:48 - 56:54)
in all our artists to to to narrow this (56:51 - 56:55)
down (56:54 - 56:59)
like yeah so first things first if you (56:55 - 57:01)
haven&#39;t already done it go look at the (56:59 - 57:04)
top 300 because they are pretty I&#39;m just (57:01 - 57:05)
looking through this in bul pipedia (57:04 - 57:07)
right now and they are pretty amazing (57:05 - 57:10)
like the Absol and the tox TriCities (57:07 - 57:13)
plenty of good ones um but what&#39;s also (57:10 - 57:15)
weird is that unless I&#39;m reading this (57:13 - 57:19)
incorrectly there are only 16 EES that (57:15 - 57:21)
made the top (57:19 - 57:27)
300 and four of them are from VK uh K (57:21 - 57:29)
which seems even weirder to me there are (57:27 - 57:33)
literally only 16 Eevees here 25% of the (57:29 - 57:36)
EES that are in the top 300 are from VK (57:33 - 57:38)
I mean the best Eevee is obviously Taki (57:36 - 57:42)
Kazu kazi&#39;s Eevee just phenomenal very (57:38 - 57:44)
good but a a very different style than (57:42 - 57:47)
vk&#39;s yeah because I like that style that (57:44 - 57:48)
style is (57:47 - 57:53)
like not water colory it almost feels (57:48 - 57:54)
like animation yeah like something you (57:53 - 57:57)
would see in like a TV show (57:54 - 57:59)
versus like something that looks like (57:57 - 58:00)
it&#39;s painted (57:59 - 58:01)
[Music] (58:00 - 58:06)
mhm yeah um yeah 15 yeah 16 looks like (58:01 - 58:09)
16 so only 16 so it&#39;s so the other (58:06 - 58:11)
question is like did not that many (58:09 - 58:13)
people submit Eevee but I find that so (58:11 - 58:15)
hard to (58:13 - 58:17)
believe like I feel like if there&#39;s a (58:15 - 58:18)
Pokemon that didn&#39;t get a lot of (58:17 - 58:20)
submissions it&#39; probably be like (58:18 - 58:24)
toxcity you really really on that not (58:20 - 58:27)
coridon the brand new poon has 21 (58:24 - 58:30)
submissions there so many good ones too (58:27 - 58:33)
these These are great now I don&#39;t know (58:30 - 58:35)
which like now the thing is is like well (58:33 - 58:37)
I mean because you said there were more (58:35 - 58:39)
than just those six that (58:37 - 58:43)
were um that people saw that look like (58:39 - 58:45)
their AI art (58:43 - 58:48)
right yeah I don&#39;t have the other (58:45 - 58:49)
there&#39;s like a whole other Twitter (58:48 - 58:52)
thread of it&#39;s a different artist I (58:49 - 58:55)
think they had two that made it and it (58:52 - 58:59)
was a but again it&#39;s like (58:55 - 58:59)
this do you want to call an artist out (59:00 - 59:07)
for AI art right exactly um T Kazu has a (59:03 - 59:09)
really good bedf as well by the way if (59:07 - 59:12)
you like oh they get two in that&#39;s like (59:09 - 59:15)
not that that&#39;s like a weird thing too (59:12 - 59:18)
is I remember the last year whatever (59:15 - 59:21)
year had the crar an I looked at it (59:18 - 59:22)
pretty frequently because we were we (59:21 - 59:24)
were like watching which crants got (59:22 - 59:27)
eliminated as they went down and I did (59:24 - 59:30)
notice that like a lot of artists this (59:27 - 59:33)
year and last year and the year before a (59:30 - 59:36)
lot of artists did get like two like two (59:33 - 59:38)
made it in it&#39;s almost like it almost (59:36 - 59:41)
feels like if somebody (59:38 - 59:45)
likes one of their two submissions then (59:41 - 59:47)
they like purpose they they go out of (59:45 - 59:48)
their way to look at the second (59:47 - 59:50)
submission it almost feels (59:48 - 59:53)
like like one is a cover letter and the (59:50 - 59:55)
other is like the resume and it&#39;s like (59:53 - 59:56)
you&#39;ve made it past the cover letter (59:55 - 59:58)
stage so now we&#39;re actually going to (59:56 - 60:00)
look at like your your the both things (59:58 - 60:04)
you submitted yeah well the art style is (60:00 - 60:06)
I mean between that Eevee and the bed (60:04 - 60:09)
here is very similar so if you know if (60:06 - 60:11)
someone&#39;s picking them out and sees an (60:09 - 60:14)
art style they like then there&#39;s at (60:11 - 60:15)
least a chance like they&#39;re going to see (60:14 - 60:17)
that and say oh this I also like this I (60:15 - 60:22)
liked the other one um but so was I um (60:17 - 60:24)
didn&#39;t hear for the rules is it two (60:22 - 60:28)
entries per Pokemon or just two entries (60:24 - 60:30)
total for my understanding it was two (60:28 - 60:34)
entries total total so like this person (60:30 - 60:36)
Tak Kazu who got the bedf and the Eevee (60:34 - 60:39)
through both of their (60:36 - 60:41)
entries got into the top (60:39 - 60:45)
300 they would have only had two (60:41 - 60:45)
entries that seems impressive to (60:45 - 60:51)
me uh here I have the Q&amp;A (60:54 - 60:58)
uh can I apply with an illustration I (60:59 - 61:03)
drew in the past as long as it&#39;s never (61:01 - 61:04)
been published you can apply with an (61:03 - 61:07)
illustration you&#39;ve Drew in the past (61:04 - 61:09)
which is as long as it&#39;s never been on (61:07 - 61:11)
as long as it&#39;s never been on Twitter or (61:09 - 61:14)
deviant art or whatever yes I drew it (61:11 - 61:18)
it&#39;s sitting on my bedroom wall (61:14 - 61:18)
like uh can I apply with an illustration (61:19 - 61:22)
that has been submitted to other (61:21 - 61:24)
contests no you (61:22 - 61:27)
cannot um I&#39;ve applied for the Pokemon (61:24 - 61:29)
card illustration contest before can I (61:27 - 61:32)
apply again you can apply before however (61:29 - 61:33)
if you&#39;ve officially worked on (61:32 - 61:35)
illustrations for the Pokemon Trading (61:33 - 61:37)
Card Game in the past you cannot apply (61:35 - 61:39)
just means if you&#39;ve ever done art for (61:37 - 61:42)
them you can&#39;t do it again is it okay to (61:39 - 61:45)
draw additional Pokemon in the one (61:42 - 61:47)
specified theme in principle you should (61:45 - 61:48)
only draw one Pokemon per illustration (61:47 - 61:50)
so it&#39;s easy to tell which Pokemon of (61:48 - 61:52)
the subject of the card however as long (61:50 - 61:53)
as it&#39;s perfectly clear who the main (61:52 - 61:55)
subject is you may draw additional (61:53 - 61:57)
Pokémon we saw that with VK cuz two of (61:55 - 61:59)
their Eevees have Vaporeon in the (61:57 - 62:01)
background can I draw Shiny Pokemon (61:59 - 62:04)
please do not draw Shiny Pokemon uh can (62:01 - 62:06)
I draw a Pokemon of their male and (62:04 - 62:07)
female versions please draw them (62:06 - 62:09)
according to the reference materials (62:07 - 62:11)
provided for each Pokemon can I draw a (62:09 - 62:13)
trainer or a human trainer along with a (62:11 - 62:15)
Pokemon do not trotle human (62:13 - 62:18)
trainers um which is funny because like (62:15 - 62:20)
I&#39;ve seen so many artists be like this (62:18 - 62:21)
was my art it wasn&#39;t submitted and (62:20 - 62:23)
there&#39;s like a trainer in the background (62:21 - 62:25)
or like you&#39;ll see like the feet of a (62:23 - 62:28)
trainer or something and it&#39;s just (62:25 - 62:28)
like (62:29 - 62:34)
yeah there has been some there was a (62:31 - 62:35)
karant card where there was like a (62:34 - 62:37)
person in the background in like the (62:35 - 62:40)
doorway and that did make it to top 300 (62:37 - 62:41)
but you couldn&#39;t like really make out (62:40 - 62:43)
the person it was like more of like a (62:41 - 62:47)
silhouette right (62:43 - 62:51)
right uh please draw on landscape Can I (62:47 - 62:53)
submit handra illustrations yes you can (62:51 - 62:55)
but please convert the illustration into (62:53 - 62:57)
a digital form with a scan (62:55 - 62:58)
[Music] (62:57 - 63:01)
uh Can I submit illustrations with (62:58 - 63:03)
pencils and color pencils yes there are (63:01 - 63:05)
no restrictions on Art material used oh (63:03 - 63:07)
there was also an artist this year that (63:05 - 63:10)
did like a 3D clay thing they did like (63:07 - 63:13)
Charizard it was so cool didn&#39;t make top (63:10 - 63:15)
300 sucks for that guy because it was (63:13 - 63:18)
awesome um can I make a Pokemon from (63:15 - 63:21)
clay yarn wool or felt yes you can make (63:18 - 63:23)

not publish your submitted art until we (63:32 - 63:38)
announce the award recipients after we (63:35 - 63:40)
announce award recipients if your (63:38 - 63:42)
illustration has not received any award (63:40 - 63:45)
you may publish it as you please uh you (63:42 - 63:46)
are free to include objects from the (63:45 - 63:48)
Pokemon world however make sure you make (63:46 - 63:50)
the Pokemon the main subject of your art (63:48 - 63:52)
please do not draw Pokemon in their (63:50 - 63:54)
tralized form which actually is a new (63:52 - 63:58)
rule this year that kind of makes sense (63:54 - 63:58)
[Music] (64:00 - 64:05)
um let&#39;s see we can only of so we can (64:01 - 64:09)

permanent residents of those countries (64:14 - 64:18)
and the legal (64:16 - 64:21)
age (64:18 - 64:24)
um we cannot accept illustrations by (64:21 - 64:26)
more than one person the applicant must (64:24 - 64:30)
be be the sole creator of the (64:26 - 64:30)
illustration uh you have to be 18 or (64:30 - 64:36)
older to participate there&#39;s no (64:33 - 64:38)
participation fee we do not accept by (64:36 - 64:41)
mail you must use a pen name or an (64:38 - 64:44)
illustrator name instead of your real (64:41 - 64:47)
name if you do so and your work is (64:44 - 64:48)
selected it will be credited to the pen (64:47 - 64:50)
name you (64:48 - 64:53)
choose uh there&#39;s a maximum of three (64:50 - 64:54)
entries per (64:53 - 64:58)
person must must all three be the same (64:54 - 65:01)
Pokemon no they do not have to be the (64:58 - 65:03)
illustrations of the same Pokemon you (65:01 - 65:06)
can freely choose any Pokemon of the (65:03 - 65:07)
contest for your illustration so there (65:06 - 65:11)
you go so three Pokemon per (65:07 - 65:15)
person so V vk&#39;s name is broken down (65:11 - 65:20)
into three different vks so they four (65:15 - 65:23)
different vks is it four or is it three (65:20 - 65:25)
there are four on that list of six there (65:23 - 65:29)
are four there&#39;s there&#39;s vegan vgo vegan (65:25 - 65:31)
K and vgo (65:29 - 65:35)
K so that would have been at least (65:31 - 65:39)
what&#39;s three * 4 12 12 12 submitted and (65:35 - 65:42)
they got six accepted assuming they (65:39 - 65:45)
didn&#39;t do what Bobby said which I didn&#39;t (65:42 - 65:48)
think about submit even more (65:45 - 65:51)
emails because they submitted (65:48 - 65:55)
four to have four different names (65:51 - 65:55)
yeah well that whole like it must be a (65:56 - 66:02)
pen name now makes it like a lot (65:58 - 66:07)
harder to uh to know if it&#39;s the same (66:02 - 66:09)
person though right it does unless (66:07 - 66:11)
somebody just submits something like (66:09 - 66:13)
this where it&#39;s just their name in (66:11 - 66:15)
different formats which I don&#39;t yeah I (66:13 - 66:20)
feel like M Mr or Mrs or or MX VK did (66:15 - 66:23)
not do a very good job at hiding yeah (66:20 - 66:26)
I&#39;m still confused about that I&#39;m (66:23 - 66:28)
looking at the official Contest rules (66:26 - 66:31)
and things like that it looks like there (66:28 - 66:35)
were uh 12 judges one 2 3 four 5 6 7 8 9 (66:31 - 66:39)
10 11 12 12 people on the judging panel (66:35 - 66:42)
oh cool okay there are a lot of (66:39 - 66:44)
Executives of the Pokemon company and of (66:42 - 66:47)
creatures and then they are five Pokemon (66:44 - 66:48)
card (66:47 - 66:50)
illustrators so I don&#39;t know if those (66:48 - 66:51)
are all the same people who narrowed (66:50 - 66:54)
them down to the top 300 but we do at (66:51 - 66:56)
least have the names of everybody (66:54 - 66:58)
supposedly on the judging panel I would (66:56 - 67:01)
assume there are some judges and I I (66:58 - 67:03)
don&#39;t think this is a complaint I would (67:01 - 67:04)
assume there are some judges that are (67:03 - 67:06)
not actually (67:04 - 67:08)
artists like they they don&#39;t draw or (67:06 - 67:10)
anything (67:08 - 67:12)
so I don&#39;t think they know what to look (67:10 - 67:14)
for for AI art that doesn&#39;t excuse the (67:12 - 67:16)
fact that there is AI art here because (67:14 - 67:18)
what are the other artists (67:16 - 67:21)
doing to not notice that (67:18 - 67:25)
also uh I just picked a random name uh (67:21 - 67:28)
yumo from from from the top 300 and they (67:25 - 67:30)
have three entries they have a (67:28 - 67:33)
feraligator they have an Absol and they (67:30 - 67:34)
have a (67:33 - 67:38)
Flygon so VK is not the only one that (67:34 - 67:43)
has multiple entries but again I do (67:38 - 67:45)
think uh here I found another one really (67:43 - 67:48)
really easy Telly tuna they also have (67:45 - 67:50)
three entries they have an Absol they (67:48 - 67:53)
have a Pikachu they have a fly (67:50 - 67:57)
gun um Sarah just has her full name on (67:53 - 67:59)
here it just says Hera Hamilton they did (67:57 - 68:01)
not use a pen name for her but maybe (67:59 - 68:04)
they did maybe her sah Hamilton maybe (68:01 - 68:06)
her last name is not Hamilton I guess I (68:04 - 68:07)
mean there&#39;s plenty of people who do (68:06 - 68:09)
that like it could just be another name (68:07 - 68:11)
that just looks like a different name (68:09 - 68:13)
that they (68:11 - 68:18)
used uh time but yeah I I noticed this (68:13 - 68:21)
there there&#39;s two Su there&#39;s a Reno Su (68:18 - 68:22)
which is a feraligator and there&#39;s just (68:21 - 68:24)
a regular Su that has a a (68:22 - 68:27)
be um but I noticed this uh with the (68:24 - 68:29)
karant that there was like a lot of (68:27 - 68:30)
names that (68:29 - 68:33)
were like slightly similar or like wow (68:30 - 68:35)
this person got like three entries made (68:33 - 68:38)
it that&#39;s that&#39;s crazy out of like 10 (68:35 - 68:40)
thou 10,000 submissions and each person (68:38 - 68:42)
could submit (68:40 - 68:47)
three uh the there&#39;s a lot (68:42 - 68:51)
of ISS this Pikachu&#39;s tight there&#39;s a (68:47 - 68:54)
lot of issues with this I don&#39;t feel I I (68:51 - 68:56)
feel like number one there needs to be (68:54 - 68:59)
better guidelines (68:56 - 69:02)
in maybe signing (68:59 - 69:04)
up there needs to be way better (69:02 - 69:08)
guidelines on the judges (69:04 - 69:08)
reviewing yeah I think that&#39;s the (69:08 - 69:12)
biggest one is all right I gotta stop (69:10 - 69:15)
looking at this art okay uh I think that (69:12 - 69:18)
that&#39;s the the biggest one is the the (69:15 - 69:20)
judges because you can put as many (69:18 - 69:22)
guidelines in there as you want and (69:20 - 69:23)
people will (69:22 - 69:26)
still people are people you know as long (69:23 - 69:28)
as someone can submit 5050 things they (69:26 - 69:31)
will right so it&#39;s it&#39;s on the it&#39;s on (69:28 - 69:32)
the Pokemon company I think this was (69:31 - 69:36)
said in the article to show how they (69:32 - 69:39)
feel about it and to really come down (69:36 - 69:42)
and make a statement about hey this (69:39 - 69:43)
isn&#39;t how this is supposed to work and (69:42 - 69:46)
we&#39;re going to remove this or we&#39;re (69:43 - 69:48)
going to do something about it to show (69:46 - 69:51)
artists going forward and the artists (69:48 - 69:54)
that didn&#39;t make the cut that they do (69:51 - 69:55)
care about the mistakes that were made (69:54 - 69:57)
made here and if they don&#39;t do anything (69:55 - 69:59)
about it and they just brush it under (69:57 - 70:02)
the rug and they just like I said they (69:59 - 70:04)
just cut out those six or the other (70:02 - 70:06)
images that were seen as AI for the next (70:04 - 70:08)
round and then those are and they just (70:06 - 70:12)
continue on then that&#39;s a problem that&#39;s (70:08 - 70:14)
a huge problem especially if they&#39;re (70:12 - 70:15)
going to continue doing these (70:14 - 70:18)
illustration contests now I did notice (70:15 - 70:20)
on the Bulbapedia site it doesn&#39;t look (70:18 - 70:23)
like there was one for (70:20 - 70:27)
2023 so I guess they they skipped they (70:23 - 70:30)
skipped the year I you know 2022 was the (70:27 - 70:33)
last one that they did yeah um (70:30 - 70:36)
so which to be fair AI has gotten a lot (70:33 - 70:39)
more popular in the last two years yeah (70:36 - 70:42)
oh absolutely lot more powerful I was (70:39 - 70:44)
thinking it was an annual thing and then (70:42 - 70:45)
I was wondering why I couldn&#39;t remember (70:44 - 70:49)
2023 and it&#39;s because it wasn&#39;t there uh (70:45 - 70:52)
so you know I I do wonder if something (70:49 - 70:55)
like this will would lead them to just (70:52 - 70:58)
saying okay well we&#39;re not going to do (70:55 - 71:01)
this again you know cuz they didn&#39;t do a (70:58 - 71:04)
thing like this for scarlet Violet right (71:01 - 71:05)
like the sword and shield thing that (71:04 - 71:08)
ended up getting completely thrown out (71:05 - 71:10)
they didn&#39;t do something well scarlet (71:08 - 71:12)
and violet had different clothing (71:10 - 71:13)
situation (71:12 - 71:16)
but so there&#39;s that but they didn&#39;t you (71:13 - 71:18)
know so it&#39;s possible that they see (71:16 - 71:20)
something like this happen they get done (71:18 - 71:22)
with this they get their (71:20 - 71:25)
finalists and maybe then they just say (71:22 - 71:27)
you know never mind I really hope that (71:25 - 71:30)
they do say something about it because (71:27 - 71:32)
there&#39;s a lot of people who (71:30 - 71:34)
deserve to hear from them there&#39;s a lot (71:32 - 71:37)
of people who didn&#39;t make that 300 cut (71:34 - 71:39)
who potentially should have or could (71:37 - 71:42)
have and I think that they deserve to (71:39 - 71:44)
hear something from the Pokemon company (71:42 - 71:47)
uh in owning up (71:44 - 71:50)
to the mistakes that were that look like (71:47 - 71:52)
they were made (71:50 - 71:55)
here yeah I think best case scenario or (71:52 - 71:57)
the scenario people want is for them to (71:55 - 72:01)
come out and say we messed up they won&#39;t (71:57 - 72:02)
they won&#39;t ever say the words we messed (72:01 - 72:05)
up say that but ideally acknowledge that (72:02 - 72:07)
they messed up that they noticed that (72:05 - 72:10)
there was AI art after the fact that all (72:07 - 72:12)
the AI art has been (72:10 - 72:14)
disqualified that it won&#39;t happen again (72:12 - 72:17)
and they&#39;re going to finish the contest (72:14 - 72:20)
with whatever was remaining after going (72:17 - 72:21)
through it one more time and getting rid (72:20 - 72:24)
of AI art again you don&#39;t want to accuse (72:21 - 72:26)
somebody of AI art that (72:24 - 72:29)
you don&#39;t know 100% for sure but in the (72:26 - 72:32)
situation of VK and the couple other (72:29 - 72:34)
ones like for (72:32 - 72:38)
sure um that that is AI (72:34 - 72:43)
art but it does set like will they do (72:38 - 72:47)
this again and if they do it again (72:43 - 72:51)
what changes are going to be in place so (72:47 - 72:54)
we&#39;re not looking (72:51 - 72:57)
at the same people taking other people&#39;s (72:54 - 72:59)
opportunities (72:57 - 73:04)
with stolen art or AI art or just (72:59 - 73:06)
breaking the rules and having multiple (73:04 - 73:10)
entries which hey VK did all (73:06 - 73:10)
three they just they did all three I saw (73:12 - 73:18)
I did I the the I guess the the the (73:16 - 73:22)
Silver Lining here is that news outlets (73:18 - 73:26)
did pick this up big creators have have (73:22 - 73:28)
talked about this we&#39;re talking about (73:26 - 73:30)
this so (73:28 - 73:32)
hopefully they are silent because they (73:30 - 73:34)
are figuring This (73:32 - 73:36)
Out Sports Illustrated is talking about (73:34 - 73:38)
it I&#39;m out of the loop the Sports (73:36 - 73:40)
Illustrated all of a sudden getting into (73:38 - 73:43)
the uh they&#39;ve done some TCG stuff (73:40 - 73:46)
before I think okay yeah Pokemon just (73:43 - 73:47)
gets (73:46 - 73:49)
clicks (73:47 - 73:52)
okay yeah that&#39;s true that&#39;s still (73:49 - 73:53)
surprising to see it was a Sports (73:52 - 73:56)
Illustrated article surprising Sports (73:53 - 73:57)
Illustrated is still around that&#39;s the (73:56 - 74:00)
real (73:57 - 74:00)
surprise um yeah it&#39;s frustrating (74:01 - 74:06)
so there&#39;s a lot of talented people out (74:07 - 74:13)
there and it sucks when that Talent got (74:09 - 74:15)
taken away from from people not (74:13 - 74:18)
following the rules or stealing art or (74:15 - 74:21)
using AI I know I follow a lot of people (74:18 - 74:24)
on Instagram who submitted stuff and (74:21 - 74:26)
then they didn&#39;t make the cut but they (74:24 - 74:27)
then showed what they submitted you know (74:26 - 74:29)
on their Instagram stories or on their (74:27 - 74:33)
posts and it&#39;s like wow so good you know (74:29 - 74:36)
like I&#39;m not a judge but it&#39;s like (74:33 - 74:38)
that&#39;s amazing artwork you know there&#39;s (74:36 - 74:40)
a lot of a lot of amazing artwork out (74:38 - 74:43)
there yeah I mean these are issues that (74:40 - 74:45)
I feel like every art contest is going (74:43 - 74:48)
to have to face going forward oh yeah (74:45 - 74:51)
more and more and I&#39;m not sure anyone (74:48 - 74:56)
has a clear-cut solution yet (74:51 - 75:00)
it would be nice if Facebook&#39;s meta tag (74:56 - 75:01)
thing worked (75:00 - 75:04)
properly right but there&#39;s no way for (75:01 - 75:06)
there&#39;s like technically there is no way (75:04 - 75:10)
for it to that&#39;s the issue there you (75:06 - 75:13)
can&#39;t always tell yeah there but but at (75:10 - 75:15)
least like flagging something to be like (75:13 - 75:17)
hey can we have a real person look at (75:15 - 75:20)
this MH again a little bit closer I (75:17 - 75:22)
think a real person should just look (75:20 - 75:24)
through all of like the once the top 300 (75:22 - 75:27)
is decided they should have a specialist (75:24 - 75:28)
go through and make sure that there are (75:27 - 75:32)
not signs clearcut signs of artificially (75:28 - 75:36)
generated artwork yeah that seems like (75:32 - 75:38)
the easiest thing to me we&#39;ll see what (75:36 - 75:41)
they do if (75:38 - 75:41)
anything all right uh let&#39;s take a break (75:42 - 75:46)
and when we come back uh we will talk (75:44 - 75:51)
about Pokemon go and (75:46 - 75:56)
their well uneventful week this week (75:51 - 75:56)
but they&#39;re they&#39;re planned for for July (75:56 - 76:02)
we will be right back and we are back (75:59 - 76:06)
from our break let&#39;s talk Pokémon go 8th (76:02 - 76:10)
anniversary from June 28th through July (76:06 - 76:13)
3rd which I think is the anniversary (76:10 - 76:16)
actually like July 6th it is but that&#39;s (76:13 - 76:20)
the weekend of go Fest (76:16 - 76:25)
yeah um what are they doing I tell you (76:20 - 76:27)
yeah move move it up a little bit can&#39;t (76:25 - 76:29)
have too many events overlapping each (76:27 - 76:32)
other what do you think this (76:29 - 76:36)
is uh there will be a grimer wearing a (76:32 - 76:38)
party hat and a Muk wearing a party hat (76:36 - 76:40)
I think this is because Grier&#39;s pokedex (76:38 - 76:44)
entry is 88 yes I wish there was (76:40 - 76:47)
something more exciting there to report (76:44 - 76:50)
on I mean it feels about right for where (76:47 - 76:54)
the game&#39;s at (76:50 - 76:54)
which I feel bad saying but it seemed (76:56 - 77:01)
really appropriate even before I&#39;d made (76:59 - 77:04)
the the Pokedex number (77:01 - 77:07)
connection yeah somebody likes g (77:04 - 77:09)
somebody who grimer is their favorite (77:07 - 77:12)
they&#39;re over the moon excited about this (77:09 - 77:14)
they&#39;re like finally grimer getting (77:12 - 77:17)
their they they&#39;re du uh meltan will (77:14 - 77:19)
return with a shiny meltan if you&#39;re (77:17 - 77:21)
lucky I believe that is going to start (77:19 - 77:24)
on you don&#39;t open your malan box until (77:21 - 77:27)
10 a.m on June 28th actually don&#39;t open (77:24 - 77:30)
your meltan box until somebody else can (77:27 - 77:34)
verify yes that it&#39;s working yep (77:30 - 77:36)
definitely yeah wait for somebody else (77:34 - 77:39)
to bite that bullet um there will be an (77:36 - 77:40)
increased chance of Lucky friends (77:39 - 77:42)
increased chance to get lucky trade in (77:40 - 77:44)
Pokemon uh friendship will increase (77:42 - 77:46)
faster through opening gifts trading (77:44 - 77:48)
battling uh all that stuff chance of (77:46 - 77:52)
finding eight or 88 or more give me (77:48 - 77:54)
ghoul coins when you spend a poké stop (77:52 - 77:55)
with a golden lur that&#39;s actually a (77:54 - 77:58)
really cool bonus do you think that (77:55 - 78:00)
they&#39;re saying or more because there&#39;s a (77:58 - 78:03)
slight very very slight chance that you (78:00 - 78:07)
could get 888 coins that would be cool (78:03 - 78:09)
that would be good that would be really (78:07 - 78:11)
really cool I feel like they that would (78:09 - 78:13)
be Niantic doing it right if even if (78:11 - 78:15)
it&#39;s a small chance just like that like (78:13 - 78:18)
slight chance at getting 888 coins would (78:15 - 78:19)
be (78:18 - 78:23)
cool uh half the egg hatch distance when (78:19 - 78:26)
eggs are placed in incubators in the uh (78:23 - 78:29)

eggs okay they have had it where the (79:42 - 79:48)
Pokemon the chance of it being shiny (79:45 - 79:51)
from an egg was higher than the wild (79:48 - 79:52)
spawn they&#39;ve definitely done that in an (79:51 - 79:56)

anniversary event but as far Pokemon (80:29 - 80:36)
sleep it would be yeah yeah right uh $2 (80:32 - 80:38)

research ticket I&#39;m not it&#39;s at least (80:38 - 80:42)
two but they have a $5 ticket too well (80:39 - 80:46)

shiny celes is what it&#39;s saying right so (81:38 - 81:42)
but it&#39;s nice that if you&#39;ve already (81:40 - 81:43)
gotten one you&#39;re still going to get the (81:42 - 81:45)
bonuses because that research was a long (81:43 - 81:47)
time (81:45 - 81:51)
ago yeah 20 20120 I (81:47 - 81:53)
believe (81:51 - 81:58)
uh maybe 21 was it not 2019 wasn&#39;t the (81:53 - 82:01)
shiny celab before Co was it no because (81:58 - 82:04)
the shiny Mew wasn&#39;t was it oh yeah no (82:01 - 82:07)
it was before shiny me huh yeah because (82:04 - 82:09)
um the movie was supposed to come out in (82:07 - 82:11)
2020 and then Co delayed it and that was (82:09 - 82:17)
I shiny celby on December 16th 2020 nice (82:11 - 82:20)
it looks like the research was long (82:17 - 82:21)
before go to or (82:20 - 82:25)
Kanto oh okay (82:21 - 82:26)
uh there will be an anniversary box in (82:25 - 82:28)
the store which will be three remote (82:26 - 82:30)
raid passes one incubator three premium (82:28 - 82:32)
battle passes for (82:30 - 82:36)
$4.99 if you do decide to give Niantic (82:32 - 82:39)
money I&#39;m not here to judge well I will (82:36 - 82:40)
judge you that&#39;s fine uh if you do (82:39 - 82:42)
decide to give Niantic money go through (82:40 - 82:46)
the web store it&#39;s just cheap you it&#39;s (82:42 - 82:49)
just better not that giving Niantic (82:46 - 82:51)
money is better but like compared to iOS (82:49 - 82:54)
or Android you do get more bang for your (82:51 - 82:56)
buck by going through the web store you (82:54 - 82:57)
can buy coins on the web store and then (82:56 - 83:00)
use them in Game Y you just save a (82:57 - 83:03)
little bit of money that&#39;s what I did (83:00 - 83:05)
recently there will be some new Avatar (83:03 - 83:09)
items there will be new showcases that&#39;s (83:05 - 83:10)
the eth year (83:09 - 83:13)
anniversary it seems fine there should (83:10 - 83:16)
be more free stuff that&#39;s that&#39;s kind of (83:13 - 83:19)
the problem here yeah I mean the event (83:16 - 83:22)
bonuses are good there are a lot of good (83:19 - 83:23)
event bonuses here and so I&#39;m (83:22 - 83:25)
appreciating that I&#39;m a little bit (83:23 - 83:28)
frustrated that they&#39;re broken down (83:25 - 83:31)
into 24hour periods for some of them (83:28 - 83:33)
yeah just do it for the whole thing just (83:31 - 83:34)
do all three of them for the whole thing (83:33 - 83:37)
I mean gez it&#39;s eight years we&#39;ve all (83:34 - 83:38)
been you know all of us who&#39;ve been (83:37 - 83:40)
playing for eight years deserve three (83:38 - 83:44)
days of bonuses instead of just 24 (83:40 - 83:47)
hours but it&#39;s it&#39;s pretty standard (83:44 - 83:49)
Pokemon go anniversary event (83:47 - 83:52)

put rookie in there make rookie shiny (84:36 - 84:39)
from the beginning kind of do one of (84:37 - 84:41)
those things and then the three (84:39 - 84:43)
starters we&#39;d be fine I would I&#39;ll give (84:41 - 84:45)
you five bucks Niantic (84:43 - 84:49)
like stop giving them they probably are (84:45 - 84:51)
going my guess would be that the Galler (84:49 - 84:54)
stuff would be the reward bonus for yeah (84:51 - 84:56)
it&#39;ll be the ultra unlock like if you (84:54 - 84:59)
didn&#39;t do a thousand whatevers we (84:56 - 85:01)
wouldn&#39;t have released Galler ever but (84:59 - 85:02)
now that you did we&#39;ll release it in (85:01 - 85:05)
September I would like us to fail that (85:02 - 85:07)
to see what niantic&#39;s plan is there is (85:05 - 85:12)
no Galler in Pokemon go we (85:07 - 85:12)
failed okay sorry continue (85:13 - 85:20)
uh uh Euro gamer caught up with Pokemon (85:17 - 85:23)
go director Michael stenka I can never (85:20 - 85:25)
say this guy&#39;s last name (85:23 - 85:29)
stanka I think that&#39;s correct yeah um (85:25 - 85:31)
the past few months have seen a number (85:29 - 85:34)
of useful quality of life features uh in (85:31 - 85:37)
the app with the recent go to Orno which (85:34 - 85:38)
moved the needle in terms of player (85:37 - 85:40)
engagement but there have been (85:38 - 85:43)
criticisms too uh not least uh there (85:40 - 85:46)
criticisms around the game Avatar update (85:43 - 85:48)
with uh which despite good attentions (85:46 - 85:51)
felt decidedly rushed and of a general (85:48 - 85:52)
slowdown in the number of Pokemon (85:51 - 85:56)
species being added I discussed I being (85:52 - 85:59)
Tom Phillips of Euro gamer uh these (85:56 - 86:03)
issues with Michael (85:59 - 86:03)
below so here&#39;s your here&#39;s your gen 8 I (86:04 - 86:10)
guess Pokemon go the question is Pokemon (86:07 - 86:12)
go has slowed down its release of new (86:10 - 86:13)
species in the game which is something (86:12 - 86:15)
I&#39;ve noticed and pointed out on Reddit (86:13 - 86:18)
as well how intentional is this as the (86:15 - 86:22)
game works within a finite number of (86:18 - 86:24)
Pokemon uh Michael says even before I (86:22 - 86:26)
read that on readit I was doing analysis (86:24 - 86:27)
new Pokemon release over time even (86:26 - 86:29)
before that uh there was that was (86:27 - 86:31)
something very top of Mind of us we felt (86:29 - 86:33)
it actually yeah it seemed to slow down (86:31 - 86:35)
a bit on this stuff and we don&#39;t want to (86:33 - 86:37)
operate the game in that way we want to (86:35 - 86:39)
consistently provide players something (86:37 - 86:41)
fun and exciting to chase it sort of (86:39 - 86:43)
naturally happened uh that way with the (86:41 - 86:45)
Cadence of events and whatnot man this (86:43 - 86:49)
guy is just yapping and uh we were (86:45 - 86:50)
putting it together but it&#39;s definitely (86:49 - 86:52)
something we want to course correct I (86:50 - 86:54)
would say players will start to see in (86:52 - 86:57)
the new upcoming season more new Pokemon (86:54 - 86:58)
coming out that they know and love in (86:57 - 87:01)
the game we also know there&#39;s a finite (86:58 - 87:04)
number of Pokemon uh as released in the (87:01 - 87:06)
last main Series games and we&#39;re really (87:04 - 87:09)
trying to think about what&#39;s what&#39;s next (87:06 - 87:11)
there how do we keep the game more (87:09 - 87:13)
exciting without solely relying on brand (87:11 - 87:16)
new releases of Pokemon that&#39;s top of (87:13 - 87:18)
the line for us but you (87:16 - 87:20)
know but but you know what you&#39;re saying (87:18 - 87:22)
isn&#39;t news to me it&#39;s definitely (87:20 - 87:23)
something our team has been putting a (87:22 - 87:25)
lot of serious consideration around and (87:23 - 87:26)
I&#39;m pretty excited with a lot of (87:25 - 87:29)
discussions we&#39;re having on that so okay (87:26 - 87:33)
they&#39;ve had a lot of time to figure out (87:29 - 87:35)
what to do other than just release new (87:33 - 87:38)
Pokemon it&#39;s not like there has been (87:35 - 87:40)
eight years of this game where they knew (87:38 - 87:42)
they were eventually going to run out (87:40 - 87:44)
and then they went and dropped a hundred (87:42 - 87:47)
Pokemon at one time when joho came out (87:44 - 87:50)
so like they started this the wrong way (87:47 - 87:52)
which whatever that was six years ago (87:50 - 87:54)
you can&#39;t like or almost eight years (87:52 - 87:56)
right it was like years ago I don&#39;t know (87:54 - 87:58)
if I blame them for dropping 100 Pokemon (87:56 - 88:00)
of jotto when it came out because like (87:58 - 88:01)
at the time they probably were like ah (88:00 - 88:04)
this game&#39;s not going to (88:01 - 88:06)
lie but when you do that you have to (88:04 - 88:08)
think like okay if we&#39;re going to drop (88:06 - 88:11)
an entire generation six months after (88:08 - 88:14)
this game came out we should probably (88:11 - 88:16)
figure out how to make the game enticing (88:14 - 88:18)
without there having to be a new Pokemon (88:16 - 88:21)
drop every I mean I would argue they (88:18 - 88:23)
kind of have at least found their (88:21 - 88:24)
solution there consider considering (88:23 - 88:27)
there haven&#39;t really been new Pokemon (88:24 - 88:29)
dropping this (88:27 - 88:33)
year in the wild no wild ones right one (88:29 - 88:36)
I guess the only new wild Pokemon yeah (88:33 - 88:40)
like the last new Pokemon I can think of (88:36 - 88:41)
that is even that new and I know there&#39;s (88:40 - 88:43)
been more since is like terator and I&#39;m (88:41 - 88:46)
sure there&#39;s like four terator fans out (88:43 - 88:48)
there but like there&#39;s Wiglet that&#39;s wi (88:46 - 88:51)
was a new oh Wiglet yeah but like who (88:48 - 88:54)
stopped playing the game to then be like (88:51 - 88:56)
I hav&#39;t played for six months someone (88:54 - 88:59)
probably wiglets (88:56 - 89:01)
here yeah no it&#39;s but even with like (88:59 - 89:03)
turnator like I know they&#39;re turnator (89:01 - 89:04)
fans don&#39;t get me wrong Tator is pretty (89:03 - 89:07)
cool but like putting a Pokemon in raids (89:04 - 89:11)
like that I wouldn&#39;t even consider that (89:07 - 89:14)
like new I I get I guess the definition (89:11 - 89:16)
of new content yes that is new content (89:14 - 89:18)
but like when they announced terator I (89:16 - 89:20)
didn&#39;t go out of my way to be like ah I (89:18 - 89:23)
gota like I got to use my free raid pass (89:20 - 89:25)
on a turnator i i I would even remote (89:23 - 89:28)
into a terator like why would I spend $2 (89:25 - 89:30)
on a terator well when they released (89:28 - 89:31)
shiny terator I was like oh now I&#39;m (89:30 - 89:33)
going to start (89:31 - 89:36)
us because that shiny is (89:33 - 89:38)
great I just like I understand what (89:36 - 89:40)
you&#39;re saying but like as somebody who (89:38 - 89:42)
has traveled to different countries to (89:40 - 89:43)
play Pokemon go as somebody who has (89:42 - 89:45)
given niic money I do genuinely love (89:43 - 89:47)
Pokemon go (89:45 - 89:52)
but I don&#39;t value a turtonator at $2 I (89:47 - 89:56)
don&#39;t value a lot of Pokémon at $2 (89:52 - 89:57)
so it&#39;s (89:56 - 90:00)
like I do think Niantic has figured it (89:57 - 90:03)
out of like keeping the game engaging (90:00 - 90:05)
because they&#39;re obviously doing that and (90:03 - 90:07)
there&#39;s players like me who don&#39;t want (90:05 - 90:09)
to spend $2 on a terator so it&#39;s like (90:07 - 90:12)
yes they added terator to raids they (90:09 - 90:14)
turned it shiny I don&#39;t know why I&#39;m (90:12 - 90:15)
using turnator as an example that&#39;s just (90:14 - 90:17)
my example go with it there are some (90:15 - 90:18)
people out there that are like I&#39;m going (90:17 - 90:22)
to keep giving Niantic $2 or I&#39;m going (90:18 - 90:24)
to do one free turnator a day until get (90:22 - 90:26)
a shiny Tator I&#39;m not discrediting (90:24 - 90:27)
that&#39;s if that&#39;s how you want to play (90:26 - 90:29)
the game but the majority of people are (90:27 - 90:31)
not doing that and like the game is (90:29 - 90:33)
still doing fine I don&#39;t know what point (90:31 - 90:37)
I&#39;m making but (90:33 - 90:40)
like I would assume that they have more (90:37 - 90:43)
things in the pipeline that isn&#39;t just (90:40 - 90:46)
like new Pokemon because I don&#39;t think (90:43 - 90:49)
adding a Wiglet adding a Tator is what (90:46 - 90:51)
is actually driving people back to this (90:49 - 90:53)
game or like ah I was going to quit the (90:51 - 90:55)
game this week but time to go get one (90:53 - 90:58)
Wiglet for no reason like I think that (90:55 - 90:59)
different people play the game for (90:58 - 91:01)
different reasons I think that some (90:59 - 91:03)
people do come back to play for new (91:01 - 91:05)
Pokemon coming out whether it&#39;s in raids (91:03 - 91:07)
or whether it&#39;s in the wild but I also (91:05 - 91:10)
think that when they are drip beating it (91:07 - 91:13)
at the speed they have been for the last (91:10 - 91:15)
three years (91:13 - 91:19)
plus it&#39;s not fun anymore to the same (91:15 - 91:23)
extent it&#39;s more just check the box kind (91:19 - 91:25)
of kind of like (91:23 - 91:27)
I would argue doing the raids in scarlet (91:25 - 91:30)
and violet can be the mightiest Mark (91:27 - 91:33)
raids get that one and done you&#39;re good (91:30 - 91:36)
yeah and and I&#39;ll be honest I mean even (91:33 - 91:38)
adding a new Pokemon to raids is a (91:36 - 91:40)
little bit better than what they do with (91:38 - 91:42)
some of them where they add them to like (91:40 - 91:46)
12K eggs or 10K eggs and then it&#39;s also (91:42 - 91:48)
a low percentage chance that you even (91:46 - 91:51)
get it and you end up having to hatch (91:48 - 91:54)
you know 15 30 10kgs before you get a (91:51 - 91:57)
Larvesta or whatever whatever that was (91:54 - 92:01)
at the time uh you know so the roll out (91:57 - 92:04)
of Pokemon has been slow and I don&#39;t (92:01 - 92:07)
think at this point it&#39;s been so slow (92:04 - 92:08)
that they&#39;re barely relying on that to (92:07 - 92:10)
bring people back anymore they are more (92:08 - 92:13)
relying on things like events so if they (92:10 - 92:16)
just finally released the Galler Pokemon (92:13 - 92:18)
so that people could stop being annoyed (92:16 - 92:21)
about that I feel like that would be a (92:18 - 92:23)
net positive they&#39;re already not relying (92:21 - 92:27)
on poke drops to bring people back it&#39;s (92:23 - 92:29)
not I know what you&#39;re saying I just I (92:27 - 92:31)
just that&#39;s not like a that&#39;s like not a (92:29 - 92:33)
long-term Solution that&#39;s like that&#39;s (92:31 - 92:36)
like a long-term (92:33 - 92:38)
solution because they&#39;re already not (92:36 - 92:41)
giving us new Pokemon yeah and like (92:38 - 92:42)
that&#39;s working for them right like (92:41 - 92:44)
people are still playing the game even (92:42 - 92:46)
though there&#39;s not no new (92:44 - 92:48)
Pokemon right exactly so they could give (92:46 - 92:50)
us the new Pokemon and then still and (92:48 - 92:51)
then continue doing what they&#39;re already (92:50 - 92:53)
doing yeah like they&#39;re they&#39;re there (92:51 - 92:55)
just give them to us and then then (92:53 - 92:57)
continue your way and you could even (92:55 - 92:59)
have more events because you have a (92:57 - 93:02)
wider variety of Pokemon to choose from (92:59 - 93:04)
maybe maybe I play the game differently (93:02 - 93:05)
but I remember when they announced like (93:04 - 93:08)
Gen 6 and it was like ah you can get um (93:05 - 93:11)
what was it it was like Fletch fingler (93:08 - 93:13)
bunnel bee and then the starters and (93:11 - 93:15)
they for whatever reason made Froakie (93:13 - 93:18)
like slightly more rare MH like none of (93:15 - 93:20)
that was like oh I need to go out and (93:18 - 93:22)
get these no like cool you did five (93:20 - 93:26)
Pokemon cuz like fun day for me yeah (93:22 - 93:28)
same because my thought process was they (93:26 - 93:30)
they&#39;ll all have Community Days it&#39;s (93:28 - 93:33)
fine like Fletching will be the new (93:30 - 93:35)
Pidgey like it will be I won&#39;t have to (93:33 - 93:36)
ever leave my house and I&#39;ll have like (93:35 - 93:38)
five fleshlings in my house well sure (93:36 - 93:41)
but eventually everything will have a (93:38 - 93:42)
community I mean like I could say like (93:41 - 93:44)
10 years from now we&#39;ll just have all (93:42 - 93:45)
the Pokemon and we&#39;ll have all the (93:44 - 93:48)
shinies and everything but like but I I (93:45 - 93:50)
like I think the difference between gen (93:48 - 93:52)
six of being like here&#39;s five poke I&#39;m (93:50 - 93:53)
pretty sure it was five I&#39;m pretty sure (93:52 - 93:55)
it was bundlebee (93:53 - 93:57)
three starters (93:55 - 94:00)
yeah that didn&#39;t feel eventful enough (93:57 - 94:03)
compared to like gen one or gen two or (94:00 - 94:05)
even gen 3 where I think they released (94:03 - 94:07)
like 40 or 50 Pokemon I just like the (94:05 - 94:09)
game is just not that (94:07 - 94:12)
anymore it&#39;s true and it it and it&#39;s (94:09 - 94:14)
like it&#39;s like World of Warcraft players (94:12 - 94:15)
they&#39;re like I want to go back to like (94:14 - 94:18)
classic wow and it&#39;s like you&#39;re never (94:15 - 94:21)
going to recapture that experience that (94:18 - 94:22)
was the first time you played World of (94:21 - 94:24)
Warcraft you&#39;re never going to recapture (94:22 - 94:26)
the very first summer of Pokémon go (94:24 - 94:30)
you&#39;re just not sure but honestly like (94:26 - 94:33)
if tomorrow all of a sudden there were (94:30 - 94:36)
30 new Pokemon to catch that would be (94:33 - 94:38)
something like there would be something (94:36 - 94:39)
to that like all of a sudden if (94:38 - 94:41)
everything around you you haven&#39;t seen (94:39 - 94:44)
before even for like if it&#39;s just for a (94:41 - 94:45)
week but the problem is is that would (94:44 - 94:47)
only be for a week and then the problem (94:45 - 94:49)
is that it&#39;s only for Galler at this (94:47 - 94:51)
point cuz they don&#39;t have that many (94:49 - 94:54)
Pokemon left but that&#39;s okay that be a (94:51 - 94:56)
really fun week that would make people (94:54 - 94:58)
really happy and then they could just go (94:56 - 95:00)
back to what they&#39;ve been doing which is (94:58 - 95:03)
not us new Pokemon that ship has sailed (95:00 - 95:04)
though they could have done that with (95:03 - 95:06)
Gen 5 they could have they could have (95:04 - 95:08)
yeah with how many there were they (95:06 - 95:09)
definit that&#39;s I thought they were going (95:08 - 95:11)
to go back to that with Gen 5 just (95:09 - 95:14)
because everything from Gen 5 was like (95:11 - 95:18)
let&#39;s start over you know so uh it was (95:14 - 95:20)
it was like oh when they didn&#39;t it yeah (95:18 - 95:21)
I was kind of like okay well this is (95:20 - 95:24)
just what it is I I do appreciate (95:21 - 95:27)
that alola has been drawn out for as (95:24 - 95:29)
long as it and like there&#39;s things (95:27 - 95:31)
events surrounding it that go Fest is (95:29 - 95:34)
about like a all this stuff I appreciate (95:31 - 95:40)
that but at the same time you know just (95:34 - 95:41)
everybody&#39;s been asking for Galler for (95:40 - 95:45)
how long like just give us some cuz some (95:41 - 95:47)
more obviously we got a few right but (95:45 - 95:50)
like you like my my favorite Pokemon is (95:47 - 95:51)
still not in the (95:50 - 95:54)
game like that that will be exciting (95:51 - 95:57)
when it gets there (95:54 - 96:00)
but I think I think it&#39;s way more (95:57 - 96:04)
important that to them to fix or add (96:00 - 96:07)
more structures than it is (96:04 - 96:08)
Pokemon (96:07 - 96:13)
themselves yeah but I guess in my mind (96:08 - 96:15)
eventually they are going to catch up to (96:13 - 96:18)
the games with how many Pokemon there (96:15 - 96:20)
are in go and how many Pokemon there are (96:18 - 96:23)
in the main Series games they are going (96:20 - 96:26)
to catch up if they keep going and so (96:23 - 96:29)
that may as well just happen and I would (96:26 - 96:31)
argue that yeah you&#39;re not going to (96:29 - 96:33)
capture the same excitement there was in (96:31 - 96:36)
the first month or two of Pokémon go (96:33 - 96:38)
that&#39;s never coming back no matter how (96:36 - 96:41)
much I miss it but seeing a Pokemon (96:38 - 96:44)
Shadow on your nearby is still a really (96:41 - 96:45)
exciting (96:44 - 96:48)
thing yeah and seeing an entire there (96:45 - 96:50)
was nothing exciting about Wiglet you&#39;ve (96:48 - 96:53)
seen I was excited about seeing a Wiglet (96:50 - 96:54)
but (96:53 - 96:56)
I just I didn&#39;t even care enough to get (96:54 - 96:58)
enough Wiglet to evolve it because well (96:56 - 97:00)
so the thing about Wiglet was that it (96:58 - 97:02)
wasn&#39;t just a new wild spawn right it (97:00 - 97:04)
was like a wild spawn in a specific (97:02 - 97:06)
biome so it still was complicated but (97:04 - 97:08)
the fact that we&#39;ve only had one new (97:06 - 97:11)
Pokemon in six in the whole six months (97:08 - 97:14)
of 2024 that&#39;s been a wild spawn it&#39;s (97:11 - 97:16)
like you can do it at a little bit of a (97:14 - 97:18)
faster PA I mean yeah no I one Pokemon (97:16 - 97:20)
in six months that you can that you can (97:18 - 97:23)
see as a silhouette on your nearby it (97:20 - 97:25)
people love I mean I think that we know (97:23 - 97:27)
people love seeing like the silhouette (97:25 - 97:29)
on the nearby like they love seeing like (97:27 - 97:31)
oh there&#39;s a new thing that I haven&#39;t (97:29 - 97:32)
seen or caught I&#39;ll be honest with you (97:31 - 97:35)
Bobby I hate the nearby because once I (97:32 - 97:37)
catch no no no no no once I catch that (97:35 - 97:40)
Wiglet it will never appear on my nearby (97:37 - 97:42)
again ever because like the nearby has (97:40 - 97:44)
been broken for eight months the nearby (97:42 - 97:46)
should have been like let me hunt (97:44 - 97:49)
specific Pokemon because once I catch it (97:46 - 97:52)
it will never appear again on my nearby (97:49 - 97:54)
the one of the best time S I had was (97:52 - 97:56)
playing with Bobby I don&#39;t know if you (97:54 - 97:58)
remember this but we were all downtown (97:56 - 98:00)
San Diego and we had a group of 10 (97:58 - 98:03)
people and one person refused to catch (98:00 - 98:06)
the Pokemon so we used their phone to (98:03 - 98:09)
find golet and other Pokemon because as (98:06 - 98:11)
soon as we caught the goet or as soon as (98:09 - 98:14)
we caught whatever we were looking for (98:11 - 98:15)
no one could see it anymore in the (98:14 - 98:18)
nearby the nearby is garbage and it has (98:15 - 98:20)
been garbage the fact that we had to (98:18 - 98:23)
have one person not catch the Pokemon so (98:20 - 98:26)
we could keep relying on nearby is (98:23 - 98:29)
insane but their silhouette kept us (98:26 - 98:31)
playing the game the fact that there was (98:29 - 98:34)
a silhouette kept us going to find a (98:31 - 98:35)
Pokemon yeah I guess their silhouette of (98:34 - 98:38)
not (98:35 - 98:38)
playing to be fair I have done that too (98:38 - 98:45)
but that&#39;s also a different thing than (98:42 - 98:47)
just having a new Pokemon on the nearby (98:45 - 98:49)
when there&#39;s a big drop of new Pokémon (98:47 - 98:51)
and your entire nearby is filled with (98:49 - 98:53)
Silhouettes I feel like it does bring (98:51 - 98:55)
back some of the Nostalgia for the early (98:53 - 98:58)
days of this game yeah little definitely (98:55 - 99:01)
when it&#39;s different Pokemon and not V SL (98:58 - 99:04)
nine times your I don&#39;t I don&#39;t I can&#39;t (99:01 - 99:06)
even remember the last time I&#39;ve like (99:04 - 99:09)
opened up my nearby because it&#39;s it&#39;s if (99:06 - 99:10)
if I like that&#39;s the thing I would want (99:09 - 99:12)
like if you&#39;re think of like 10 years of (99:10 - 99:14)
this game like there should be an option (99:12 - 99:16)
where I could go in and be like I&#39;m (99:14 - 99:19)
looking for Snorlax (99:16 - 99:22)
yeah yeah assuming that Snorlax is (99:19 - 99:25)
spawning maybe Snorlax (99:22 - 99:28)
playing more I think honestly because if (99:25 - 99:29)
people were able to find the Pokemon (99:28 - 99:32)
they were looking for yeah like like if (99:29 - 99:34)
they were like hey this this week is (99:32 - 99:36)
fairy and drag man that fairy and dragon (99:34 - 99:38)
week was so good this week is fairy and (99:36 - 99:40)
dragon week and we&#39;re increasing Den in (99:38 - 99:42)
the wild like if you&#39;re a lucky trainer (99:40 - 99:44)
it&#39;s like cool let me select den and (99:42 - 99:45)
like that would actually get me out in (99:44 - 99:47)
walking like okay I walk this pokus up (99:45 - 99:49)
Den spawned oh from this Poké stop I can (99:47 - 99:51)
see Den is like a half mile away I guess (99:49 - 99:52)
I&#39;m going to walk in that direction (99:51 - 99:54)
because I don&#39;t know where else would (99:52 - 99:56)
walk yeah (99:54 - 99:59)
um (99:56 - 99:59)
anyways speaking of Pokemon they&#39;re (100:00 - 100:05)
running out of uh what&#39;s his name Tom (100:02 - 100:07)
Tom Tom asked about Mega (100:05 - 100:10)
Pokemon uh Mega Pokemon released now (100:07 - 100:12)
last November (100:10 - 100:16)
the hold on where&#39;s the question there (100:12 - 100:18)
has been only one Mega Pokemon since (100:16 - 100:20)
last November it was Heracross which is (100:18 - 100:22)
a definite slowdown do you feel like uh (100:20 - 100:25)
do you do you feel the need to let (100:22 - 100:26)
players complete their Mega decks before (100:25 - 100:28)
going onto something else or will megas (100:26 - 100:29)
be something that players are still (100:28 - 100:32)
chasing for a while uh Michael says one (100:29 - 100:34)
of my favorites is Mega Mewtwo we try to (100:32 - 100:36)
approach things on an individual Pokemon (100:34 - 100:38)
basis so it&#39;s not necessarily we want to (100:36 - 100:39)
finish off a chunk of this before moving (100:38 - 100:42)
on to the next thing it&#39;s more like (100:39 - 100:43)
we&#39;re trying to think about the right (100:42 - 100:45)
moment to or opportunity to feature (100:43 - 100:48)
something like Mega Mewtwo uh what will (100:45 - 100:50)
that do to Pokemon Justice for how epic (100:48 - 100:52)
you know they are that&#39;s where when I (100:50 - 100:55)
mentioned earlier the Rel of new Pokemon (100:52 - 100:57)
just naturally went the way it did for (100:55 - 100:58)
the first half of the (100:57 - 101:00)
year (100:58 - 101:03)
um with the few Maring megas we have (101:00 - 101:05)
left we we really want to make sure we (101:03 - 101:08)
release them in a meaningful way I got (101:05 - 101:09)
news for you Michael there ain&#39;t no (101:08 - 101:12)
meaningful way to introduce uh Mega (101:09 - 101:14)
Sharpedo I&#39;m (101:12 - 101:15)
[Applause] (101:14 - 101:19)
sorry well if you if you rework the team (101:15 - 101:22)
go rocket system and you introduce Team (101:19 - 101:25)
Magma and Team Aqua (101:22 - 101:27)
that&#39;s a meaningful (101:25 - 101:30)
way I guess that&#39;s true if you did (101:27 - 101:33)
something with Team Aqua and Team Magma (101:30 - 101:36)
for Mega camerupt which still has not (101:33 - 101:39)
been released and mega Sharpedo which (101:36 - 101:40)
you know people have already calculated (101:39 - 101:42)
the current megas that are out are just (101:40 - 101:45)
better there&#39;s no reason to Mega Evolve (101:42 - 101:48)
Sharpedo when Gyarados has existed for (101:45 - 101:52)
what four years mega Gyarados five (101:48 - 101:55)
years um (101:52 - 101:57)
yeah I guess I mean that&#39;s buying into (101:55 - 101:59)
like whether you trust Michael or not (101:57 - 102:01)
the guy shows up once a year does these (101:59 - 102:04)
interview says a lot of things and then (102:01 - 102:06)
like oh yeah I mean all of this article (102:04 - 102:09)
is just saying it&#39;s on our mind right (102:06 - 102:12)
yeah we know that this is a thing yeah (102:09 - 102:14)
well and also there&#39;s no way that Mega (102:12 - 102:16)
Mewtwo isn&#39;t the last Mega right like at (102:14 - 102:18)
this point in time because it&#39;s like (102:16 - 102:20)
Mega Rick is already out there Mega (102:18 - 102:23)
Dan&#39;s already out there I feel like no (102:20 - 102:26)
Odo yet they&#39;re going to end the whole (102:23 - 102:29)
thing with mega Ado that&#39;s that&#39;s what (102:26 - 102:32)
they&#39;re going to do this is just another (102:29 - 102:34)
case of a ever dwindling list of things (102:32 - 102:36)
that they&#39;re releasing and drip feeding (102:34 - 102:38)
because they&#39;re getting close to the end (102:36 - 102:40)
it&#39;s the same thing as with the Pokedex (102:38 - 102:43)
Legend Za could potentially bring that&#39;s (102:40 - 102:45)
true leg could add more megas it would (102:43 - 102:46)
make (102:45 - 102:49)
Mega it would be easier to release Mega (102:46 - 102:51)
Sharpedo and mega camera up when you (102:49 - 102:54)
have better megas behind that (102:51 - 102:56)
that&#39;s true you make a great (102:54 - 102:59)
Point uh Pokemon go is missing much of (102:56 - 103:01)
gen 8 and I suppose after megas it will (102:59 - 103:03)
be expecting either Z moves or (103:01 - 103:06)
gigantamax to appear next uh would it (103:03 - 103:07)
make sense to launch gen 8 and (103:06 - 103:09)
gigantamax around the same time Michael (103:07 - 103:10)
says we&#39;ve definitely been thinking a (103:09 - 103:12)
lot of gen 8 for a while in Pokemon go (103:10 - 103:14)
nothing to share right now in terms of (103:12 - 103:16)
timing or launch strategy but we&#39;re (103:14 - 103:18)
always trying to what we&#39;re always (103:16 - 103:20)
trying to do is pay homage to the source (103:18 - 103:22)
material and do right by the source (103:20 - 103:23)
material know that the the team is (103:22 - 103:25)
thinking about gen8 Pokemon and thinking (103:23 - 103:28)
about Galler thinking about what makes (103:25 - 103:30)
those Pokemon special and when is the (103:28 - 103:32)
right time for their Pokemon go debut it (103:30 - 103:35)
will make sense okay I know I just said (103:32 - 103:38)
I want Galler out but do not skip over Z (103:35 - 103:40)
moves for ganim X please let&#39;s get those (103:38 - 103:43)
Z moves in in some fashion before (103:40 - 103:44)
they&#39;re introducing (103:43 - 103:49)
gigantamax because alola is (103:44 - 103:52)
best uh as time goes on more players hit (103:49 - 103:55)
Pokemon Go&#39;s current level cap of 50 is (103:52 - 103:58)
that is your thinking expanding that cap (103:55 - 104:00)
changing over time as more and more (103:58 - 104:01)
people get there Michael says as (104:00 - 104:03)
somebody who&#39;s been 50 myself for a (104:01 - 104:05)
couple years now I personally feel uh (104:03 - 104:08)
I&#39;m missing that chase of continuing the (104:05 - 104:10)
grind going after the accomplishment (104:08 - 104:11)
it&#39;s definitely something we&#39;ve talked (104:10 - 104:12)
about for a good amount for me (104:11 - 104:14)
personally something I want to resolve (104:12 - 104:16)
before we take the next step if we (104:14 - 104:17)
decide to increase levels again is (104:16 - 104:20)
bringing more of our player base up to (104:17 - 104:21)
the current thresholds you don&#39;t ever (104:20 - 104:23)
want to be in a position where you&#39;re (104:21 - 104:24)
long long term franchise players are (104:23 - 104:26)
level 60 but new players feel like they (104:24 - 104:28)
have to play 10 years of catchup fixing (104:26 - 104:30)
that root challenge is something we&#39;ll (104:28 - 104:33)
have to go hand inand if we do some type (104:30 - 104:35)
of level cap increase you might recall (104:33 - 104:37)
the first increase to level 50 (104:35 - 104:39)
completely Chang The Source xp games (104:37 - 104:40)
it&#39;s hard to remember but that that (104:39 - 104:43)
previous update XP was much harder much (104:40 - 104:45)
much harder to come by and now you can (104:43 - 104:46)
reasonably get to level 30 if you&#39;re (104:45 - 104:48)
playing regularly in a month or a couple (104:46 - 104:50)
months depending on how hardcore you&#39;re (104:48 - 104:52)
playing now if we take things to level (104:50 - 104:53)
60 hypothetically we want to make sure (104:52 - 104:55)
players also have a great opportunity to (104:53 - 104:57)
catch up if they&#39;re coming new to the (104:55 - 105:01)
game that that&#39;s probably the the best (104:57 - 105:03)
question he answered in this (105:01 - 105:05)
interview um which is like a real (105:03 - 105:07)
problem that they would have to solve (105:05 - 105:09)
and I do think a lot of people forgot (105:07 - 105:13)
how hard it was to level (105:09 - 105:17)
up before the 50 to 40 cap um one of the (105:13 - 105:18)
things they changed is if you got an (105:17 - 105:22)
excellent throw you got a th000 XP (105:18 - 105:23)
versus (105:22 - 105:25)
it was just a 100 before so like getting (105:23 - 105:27)
excellent throws would be like catching (105:25 - 105:28)
10 Pokemon at (105:27 - 105:32)
once and if you&#39;re were good at (105:28 - 105:35)
that you could get significantly more XP (105:32 - 105:36)
than somebody who was not getting (105:35 - 105:39)
excellent (105:36 - 105:39)
throws uh (105:41 - 105:46)
they talk about (105:43 - 105:49)
the the the evolving pidgeys to level up (105:46 - 105:52)
oh jeez I those were the days L throw a (105:49 - 105:56)
lucky egg on and Evol 57 (105:52 - 105:58)
Pidgey a couple years ago Mato made his (105:56 - 106:00)
debut in artwork that was teased in the (105:58 - 106:02)
addition of roots and games the lady on (106:00 - 106:04)
the police of art work has not debuted (106:02 - 106:06)
any news on where she is at that&#39;s (106:04 - 106:07)
actually a good question because I (106:06 - 106:10)
completely forgot about that lady yeah (106:07 - 106:12)
MH the artwork you&#39;re referring to they (106:10 - 106:14)
always become my computer background for (106:12 - 106:17)
a year sometimes in that there&#39;s a bit (106:14 - 106:20)
of a peer into the future beyond that (106:17 - 106:21)
year sometimes it&#39;s a bit more (106:20 - 106:23)
aspirational than what we&#39;re ready to go (106:21 - 106:26)
for so if I wouldn&#39;t look into that as a (106:23 - 106:28)
definite road map of Any Given year in (106:26 - 106:30)
Pokémon go that&#39;s true didn&#39;t they like (106:28 - 106:32)
show Mega Mewtwo like three years ago (106:30 - 106:35)
yeah and they had and they had groi and (106:32 - 106:38)
sabble and score bunny in a couple years (106:35 - 106:40)
ago as well I think instead it&#39;s (106:38 - 106:41)
something we&#39;re excited about and almost (106:40 - 106:43)
A Creative Vision for where we would (106:41 - 106:45)
genuinely like the games to go in the (106:43 - 106:48)
future but it&#39;s not one to one as what (106:45 - 106:49)
is to (106:48 - 106:52)
come when Matteo did pop up he mentioned (106:49 - 106:55)
he was interested in extra extra small (106:52 - 106:56)
Pokemon is that something he&#39;s still (106:55 - 106:58)
interested in in I I like how the (106:56 - 107:01)
interview is like yeah you me and Mato (106:58 - 107:03)
we had tea last (107:01 - 107:06)
week he didn&#39;t mention any XX small (107:03 - 107:08)
Pokemon I&#39;ve been (107:06 - 107:10)
concerned we want players to find Value (107:08 - 107:12)
in all different types of Pokemon and xx (107:10 - 107:15)
XX extra extra small is not just (107:12 - 107:17)
visually fun to see uh we want to make (107:15 - 107:18)
sure players can find Value in different (107:17 - 107:21)
Pokemon they have in their (107:18 - 107:23)
inventory okay so nothing nothing yet (107:21 - 107:25)
with don&#39;t I guess don&#39;t throw away your (107:23 - 107:28)
extra extra small Pokemon uh too late (107:25 - 107:29)
too (107:28 - 107:31)
late (107:29 - 107:33)
H well to be fair I also threw away the (107:31 - 107:37)
XXL ones so fa okay (107:33 - 107:38)
yeah (107:37 - 107:41)
um we&#39;ll we&#39;ll have the whole interview (107:38 - 107:42)
in the show notes if you want to read it (107:41 - 107:43)
there&#39;s a couple more questions we (107:42 - 107:45)
skipped (107:43 - 107:48)
but (107:45 - 107:48)
um I I I wish there was just (107:48 - 107:54)
like more (107:54 - 107:58)
substance and I know like this is a very (107:55 - 108:00)
like Michael can only say what he&#39;s (107:58 - 108:04)
allowed to say kind of thing MH but I (108:00 - 108:06)
feel like the takeaway of Michael&#39;s (108:04 - 108:08)
interviews whether he like did one with (108:06 - 108:10)
Zoe he does one with like Game Informer (108:08 - 108:12)
or Euro gamer every (108:10 - 108:15)
year he&#39;s done a I think he done did one (108:12 - 108:17)
with like trainer tips at one point they (108:15 - 108:19)
all (108:17 - 108:19)
just they&#39;re so Broad and generalized (108:19 - 108:26)
that they don&#39;t instill any (108:24 - 108:28)
like (108:26 - 108:32)
confidence I feel like as a (108:28 - 108:36)
player it&#39;s it it reminds me of (108:32 - 108:39)
like if you if you&#39;re familiar with like (108:36 - 108:43)
the tech world like any Apple interview (108:39 - 108:45)
that happens when it&#39;s like you know (108:43 - 108:47)
that they&#39;re not going to answer any (108:45 - 108:49)
like you know every question you ask has (108:47 - 108:50)
an answer and it&#39;s not going to be the (108:49 - 108:53)
answer you&#39;re probably hoping for it&#39;s (108:50 - 108:55)
going to be vague it&#39;s going to be (108:53 - 108:56)
General it&#39;s not going to discuss (108:55 - 108:58)
anything they know they can&#39;t discuss (108:56 - 109:00)
and the interviewer is probably not (108:58 - 109:01)
going to ask them anything that they (109:00 - 109:02)
know they&#39;re not going to be able to (109:01 - 109:05)
answer like directly or else it&#39;s just (109:02 - 109:07)
not going to give them any information (109:05 - 109:09)
right yeah I mean that&#39;s the thing I (109:07 - 109:10)
feel like those are slightly different (109:09 - 109:13)
because they just won&#39;t ask or won&#39;t (109:10 - 109:15)
answer those kinds of questions whereas (109:13 - 109:18)
in these interviews with Michael he will (109:15 - 109:21)
answer he&#39;ll just say it&#39;s on our mind (109:18 - 109:22)
we&#39;ve been thinking about it okay sure (109:21 - 109:23)
so (109:22 - 109:25)
that but that&#39;s what I&#39;m saying like if (109:23 - 109:27)
an interviewer does ask Apple something (109:25 - 109:29)
about some future thing they also say (109:27 - 109:31)
the same thing it&#39;s on our mind we&#39;re (109:29 - 109:32)
thinking about it you know we can&#39;t say (109:31 - 109:34)
anything more but it&#39;s on our mind it&#39;s (109:32 - 109:36)
the same kind of interview where if (109:34 - 109:37)
those questions do get asked you&#39;re (109:36 - 109:39)
never going to get the answer you&#39;re (109:37 - 109:41)
hoping (109:39 - 109:43)
for yeah it would just be nice to be (109:41 - 109:46)
like yes we do want Z moves to come to (109:43 - 109:48)
the game yes we do want Dynamax to come (109:46 - 109:50)
to the game not even Dynamax I don&#39;t (109:48 - 109:52)
even think Dynamax makes sense cuz like (109:50 - 109:53)
the raid bosses are already big (109:52 - 109:55)
gigantamax I guess would make more sense (109:53 - 109:58)
because they visually change the Pokemon (109:55 - 109:59)
is that what he asked you ask about (109:58 - 110:01)
gigantamax or you he asked about (109:59 - 110:04)
gigantamax Dynamax okay good um yeah (110:01 - 110:06)
they&#39;ve been dynamaxing for years yeah (110:04 - 110:08)
they&#39;ve been they&#39;ve they&#39;ve been (110:06 - 110:14)
dynamaxing um it would also be nice for (110:08 - 110:14)
like uh anything (110:14 - 110:20)
regarding the character customization (110:17 - 110:22)
that was not really brought up yeah I (110:20 - 110:24)
thought did didn&#39;t the headline say (110:22 - 110:26)
something about the Avatar backlash uh (110:24 - 110:30)
that of the article different let me see (110:26 - 110:32)
if uh cuz I think I think there (110:30 - 110:35)
were I think he was not like oneon-one I (110:32 - 110:38)
think there was a room of people oh and (110:35 - 110:40)
people asked different (110:38 - 110:42)
questions um because he didn&#39;t mention (110:40 - 110:44)
any remote raid passes here I have a (110:42 - 110:46)
different article with Esports where he (110:44 - 110:48)
brings up remote raid (110:46 - 110:51)
passes um it (110:48 - 110:51)
says let&#39;s see see uh Michael quote say (110:51 - 110:57)
I will say I will say that we found out (110:55 - 111:00)
after we made change the made the change (110:57 - 111:01)
change referring to the increase of (111:00 - 111:03)
remote raid passes the price increase (111:01 - 111:05)
holy cow the amount of ads on this (111:03 - 111:09)
website um uh we&#39;ve seen so after we&#39;ve (111:05 - 111:11)
made the (111:09 - 111:13)
change it was exactly what we were (111:11 - 111:15)
hoping for Michael said we&#39;ve seen more (111:13 - 111:17)
in-person communities coming back (111:15 - 111:18)
together those local communities are (111:17 - 111:20)
flourishing in a way we haven&#39;t seen (111:18 - 111:23)
since pre pandemic (111:20 - 111:24)
as much as we want to give players the (111:23 - 111:26)
opportunity to use remote raid passes we (111:24 - 111:28)
decided they can&#39;t come at the expense (111:26 - 111:30)
mission of our game that&#39;s something (111:28 - 111:32)
that we&#39;ve cherished within this company (111:30 - 111:34)
at Niantic and you know it&#39;s something (111:32 - 111:36)
we&#39;ve tried to strike a good balance as (111:34 - 111:38)
we can thereby still offering players (111:36 - 111:41)
the ability to do do remote raids at a (111:38 - 111:43)
limited (111:41 - 111:43)
rate uh in hindsight the remote raid (111:44 - 111:49)
past decision was definitely the right (111:47 - 111:53)
decision so yeah but that&#39;s old we&#39;ve (111:49 - 111:55)
talked about that that&#39;s not the same (111:53 - 111:56)
thing as the Avatar (111:55 - 112:01)
stuff yeah yes that was just this same (111:56 - 112:05)
date as the oh sport the same date as (112:01 - 112:09)
the uh Euro gamer stuff it&#39;s just Euro (112:05 - 112:12)
gamer didn&#39;t ask about remote R (112:09 - 112:12)
passes I see nothing about the character (112:14 - 112:20)
stuff even though I do see oh you know (112:18 - 112:23)
what we skipped it there was a there was (112:20 - 112:24)
a question about feedback to the (112:23 - 112:26)
Character Creator update this year was (112:24 - 112:28)
mixed are there still changes you&#39;d like (112:26 - 112:31)
to make there in the Euro gamer one yeah (112:28 - 112:34)
it was right before the Mato question oh (112:31 - 112:36)
yeah I couldn&#39;t bass up the Matteo (112:34 - 112:40)
question no of course (112:36 - 112:43)
uh for the character stuff uh he says (112:40 - 112:44)
absolutely we knew that there was going (112:43 - 112:45)
to be a challenging one for us players (112:44 - 112:47)
have grown to love their avatars in the (112:45 - 112:48)
past seven and a half years and anytime (112:47 - 112:49)
we change something of that there&#39;s a (112:48 - 112:51)
lot of risk involved some people might (112:49 - 112:53)
not be happy with it whereas others (112:51 - 112:54)
might appreciate us responding to the (112:53 - 112:56)
feedback over the years from players who (112:54 - 112:58)
felt the Avatar system was (112:56 - 113:00)
outdated we definitely saw a lot of (112:58 - 113:02)
feedback that players still didn&#39;t feel (113:00 - 113:03)
like it matched what they were hoping (113:02 - 113:05)
for the team has been hardworking at (113:03 - 113:07)
that feedback and we&#39;ve already made (113:05 - 113:09)
some up updates and adjustments like (113:07 - 113:11)
improving different body proportions and (113:09 - 113:12)
the different skin (113:11 - 113:15)
tones are they saying that&#39;s did they (113:12 - 113:17)
that they did yeah they did fix some of (113:15 - 113:20)
those things made Minor Adjustments have (113:17 - 113:22)
changed a little bit and then the uh (113:20 - 113:24)
some of the proportions have slightly (113:22 - 113:27)
changed I would say that it&#39;s just the (113:24 - 113:28)
start we want to continue adding more (113:27 - 113:30)
features making it more diverse my goal (113:28 - 113:31)
is for every single player in the world (113:30 - 113:32)
to feel like they can be represented the (113:31 - 113:34)
other thing we want to share on this (113:32 - 113:35)
front is how just technically (113:34 - 113:37)
challenging that feature was for us to (113:35 - 113:38)
bring to Market because we have this (113:37 - 113:40)
backlog of different Avatar items (113:38 - 113:43)
articles clothings and poses and they (113:40 - 113:46)
were all designed for a two two very (113:43 - 113:48)
specific form factors taking those (113:46 - 113:50)
hundreds and dozens of Avatar items and (113:48 - 113:51)
applying them in much more of a (113:50 - 113:53)
customizable character way is very very (113:51 - 113:55)
tricky but we&#39;ve seen the feedback and (113:53 - 113:56)
we&#39;re already making some adjustments (113:55 - 113:59)
and we have more to come well they were (113:56 - 114:00)
already messed up on the two form (113:59 - 114:03)
factors that were supposed to be made (114:00 - 114:06)
for they weren&#39;t perfect on those two (114:03 - 114:08)
either (114:06 - 114:11)
right (114:08 - 114:11)
um I don&#39;t know I like Pokemon go (114:15 - 114:22)
but there are a lot of issues it&#39;s in a (114:19 - 114:24)
bit of a weird right now we&#39;ll see if it (114:22 - 114:25)
makes it to 10 (114:24 - 114:28)
years I mean the last 6 months they did (114:25 - 114:31)
do a lot of good quality of life updates (114:28 - 114:33)
they I will say that I don&#39;t want to (114:31 - 114:36)
forget that they have done a number of (114:33 - 114:39)
good small but impactful quality of life (114:36 - 114:40)
Updates this (114:39 - 114:44)
year but there&#39;s still just drip feeding (114:40 - 114:47)
the Pokemon all the tickets that are (114:44 - 114:50)
paid tickets there&#39;s just a lot yeah (114:47 - 114:52)
some really lackluster events as well (114:50 - 114:54)
which every event doesn&#39;t have to be (114:52 - 114:56)
amazing but it feels like there have (114:54 - 114:59)
been in a row just and I guess right now (114:56 - 115:00)
it kind of makes sense cuz they&#39;ve got (114:59 - 115:02)
the go fests going on and stuff and so (115:00 - 115:04)
they want to focus on that but it just (115:02 - 115:06)
feels like this year there&#39;s been a lot (115:04 - 115:08)
of events that (115:06 - 115:11)
are just not I don&#39;t know it&#39;s not (115:08 - 115:12)
things that are bringing people to (115:11 - 115:14)
playing the game a whole lot it feels (115:12 - 115:16)
like I mean you even look at just like (115:14 - 115:18)
the eth year anniversary event and it&#39;s (115:16 - 115:20)
like why is that why is that event $2 (115:18 - 115:23)
just mhm make it free it&#39;s your (115:20 - 115:24)
anniversary just make it free for (115:23 - 115:27)
everyone right mhm yeah I mean it&#39;s $2 (115:24 - 115:30)
because the game is8 years in that&#39;s (115:27 - 115:32)
that&#39;s part of it (115:30 - 115:36)
yeah it it there there is like (115:32 - 115:40)
some bitter sweetness to Michael (115:36 - 115:41)
continuing to double down on the remote (115:40 - 115:44)
raid pass thing like I I didn&#39;t I didn&#39;t (115:41 - 115:45)
think Niantic was going to change their (115:44 - 115:48)
mind on it sure but it&#39;s been what it&#39;s (115:45 - 115:51)
been two years since that change I think (115:48 - 115:53)
mhm and people are still like revert it (115:51 - 115:55)
back and he&#39;s like (115:53 - 116:00)
