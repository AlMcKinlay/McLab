full spoiler thing in a second here uh (0:42 - 0:46)
but first i have greg (0:44 - 0:48)
hi (0:46 - 0:50)
and i have a little look (0:48 - 0:53)
i'm technically at work at the moment i (0:50 - 0:55)
mean so am i but greg you were supposed (0:53 - 0:57)
to make a statement about people (0:55 - 0:59)
completing things (0:57 - 1:00)
was i (0:59 - 1:01)
yes i mean i've seen a bunch of (1:00 - 1:03)
completionists people have completed a (1:01 - 1:05)
lot of video games no no i'm talking (1:03 - 1:08)
about i showed you that i knit something (1:05 - 1:10)
and it's fully finished ready to be (1:08 - 1:13)
transferred to its new owner i don't (1:10 - 1:14)
recall this i would need a reminder (1:13 - 1:16)
right now immediately wow (1:14 - 1:18)
show it on screen (1:16 - 1:20)
that's right here (1:18 - 1:22)
look at that beautiful hat (1:20 - 1:24)
congratulations on completing a knit (1:22 - 1:26)
project you are in the 0.1 (1:24 - 1:29)
knitters now you can open up an etsy (1:26 - 1:31)
from one hat yes yeah (1:29 - 1:33)
one hat etsy store (1:31 - 1:36)
um okay uh this is like uh we didn't do (1:33 - 1:38)
a mini series like we did for diamond (1:36 - 1:39)
pro mostly because we didn't know the (1:38 - 1:41)
structure of the game uh (1:39 - 1:43)
i guess (1:41 - 1:45)
if if you look at your trainer card for (1:43 - 1:46)
five seconds you realize there's five (1:45 - 1:48)
spots for five different novel nobles (1:46 - 1:49)
it's (1:48 - 1:53)
specifically after you beat cleaver (1:49 - 1:55)
cleaver so in retrospect we probably (1:53 - 1:58)
could have done five episodes (1:55 - 1:59)
uh (1:58 - 2:00)
but hey here we are (1:59 - 2:03)
[Laughter] (2:00 - 2:04)
hey you got a two-hour episode monday (2:03 - 2:06)
you're getting another episode here and (2:04 - 2:08)
i mean also if you did like the the (2:06 - 2:12)
nobles and the ride pokemon which you (2:08 - 2:13)
also have to unlock you could have we (2:12 - 2:16)
could have done what nine ten (2:13 - 2:18)
yeah we could really upgrade (2:16 - 2:20)
so if you're (2:18 - 2:21)
curious about what we're gonna talk (2:20 - 2:22)
about this show we're going to we're (2:21 - 2:24)
going to be talking about the battle (2:22 - 2:26)
system i want to go over that again (2:24 - 2:27)
um (2:26 - 2:28)
because i do think it's one of the (2:27 - 2:30)
weaker parts of the game (2:28 - 2:32)
i want to go over the (2:30 - 2:34)
shiny hunting method (2:32 - 2:38)
and i want to go over up to all of area (2:34 - 2:40)
two including that noble battle and then (2:38 - 2:43)
a little bit of area three i know will (2:40 - 2:45)
has not seen that noble yet so we can (2:43 - 2:47)
just talk about the beginning area of (2:45 - 2:50)
noble three or area three because it (2:47 - 2:51)
just we'll talk about the basket legion (2:50 - 2:53)
stuff because it's the water area (2:51 - 2:55)
spoiler it is the weakest of the five (2:53 - 2:56)
masks (2:55 - 2:58)
well (2:56 - 2:59)
well i'm (2:58 - 3:03)
i got some some words about area too so (2:59 - 3:04)
oh boy (3:03 - 3:08)
area 2 is a godsend compared to hero3 (3:04 - 3:09)
okay (3:08 - 3:11)
it (3:09 - 3:13)
i know this is a me problem and i'm (3:11 - 3:14)
going to state this (3:13 - 3:17)
i would i was running across rocks that (3:14 - 3:19)
had cracks in them like oh (3:17 - 3:21)
i wonder when i'll get rock smash to (3:19 - 3:23)
crack those because that's how my brain (3:21 - 3:25)
thinks pokemon game i've had that (3:23 - 3:27)
thought please tell me it's coming (3:25 - 3:31)
as long as you have a pokemon that knows (3:27 - 3:34)
rock smash you can use it immediately (3:31 - 3:35)
i don't think it i don't think it needs (3:34 - 3:37)
no rock smash i think you just throw (3:35 - 3:39)
anything (3:37 - 3:41)
i've i threw a bunch of stuff and (3:39 - 3:42)
nothing happened i threw one with rock (3:41 - 3:45)
smash and it happened so that is my (3:42 - 3:47)
because i would throw stuff against (3:45 - 3:48)
those big (3:47 - 3:50)
look like they could break rocks and (3:48 - 3:51)
nothing i've always seen like three of (3:50 - 3:52)
them there's like one of the first (3:51 - 3:55)
they're everywhere (3:52 - 3:55)
they're the thing is (3:55 - 3:59)
we're talking about different rocks (3:57 - 4:01)
big (3:59 - 4:01)
yeah i've only seen like three of them (4:04 - 4:07)
like one on the first island and like (4:05 - 4:08)
two on the second (4:07 - 4:09)
i don't know why i'm calling them (4:08 - 4:11)
islands (4:09 - 4:13)
the whole (4:11 - 4:16)
i've ran into a bunch (4:13 - 4:16)
i don't think it needs right i think you (4:16 - 4:19)
just throw any (4:17 - 4:20)
because i feel like i threw a glammy out (4:19 - 4:22)
one and it broke it and i'm gonna tell (4:20 - 4:24)
you right now glammy i ain't no (4:22 - 4:28)
don't got no rock smash on here on her (4:24 - 4:28)
i can't say i haven't tried it (4:28 - 4:32)
you are correct and the game tells you (4:30 - 4:34)
nothing in the sense you just see it and (4:32 - 4:35)
you don't really think to like just (4:34 - 4:37)
throw a pokemon (4:35 - 4:39)
well i did think (4:37 - 4:42)
i hope i get that move because i have (4:39 - 4:44)
these things blocking my way and the way (4:42 - 4:46)
i've been thinking about it is oh there (4:44 - 4:49)
must be a ride pokemon that like will (4:46 - 4:51)
charge this to smash it open that was my (4:49 - 4:53)
other thought i didn't sort of i i may (4:51 - 4:56)
have been like distorted a bit by (4:53 - 4:58)
monster hunter stories where it's like (4:56 - 5:00)
oh if you're riding this monster it has (4:58 - 5:02)
these terrain effects if you ride this (5:00 - 5:04)
monster it has these terrain effects and (5:02 - 5:06)
i'm like oh okay i just need the pokemon (5:04 - 5:08)
that does that (5:06 - 5:10)
can we uh before we i don't want to (5:08 - 5:11)
start off the show complaining about the (5:10 - 5:12)
battle system but i don't want to (5:11 - 5:13)
explain why (5:12 - 5:15)
i'm just saying (5:13 - 5:17)
oh no no i'm just saying that's one of (5:15 - 5:19)
the topics i want to get to let's talk (5:17 - 5:22)
about the story real quick uh because (5:19 - 5:24)
you guys always make fun of me for not (5:22 - 5:26)
reading or not caring about the story (5:24 - 5:28)
which for the most part there is some (5:26 - 5:30)
truth to that uh when i love the truth (5:28 - 5:32)
not some (5:30 - 5:33)
there's a lot (5:32 - 5:35)
i had to send you down and explain final (5:33 - 5:38)
fantasy 14 to you buddy so i think i (5:35 - 5:39)
think that (5:38 - 5:41)
at least the way i play video games and (5:39 - 5:42)
i feel like i know the way i play video (5:41 - 5:44)
games there has to be a pretty good hook (5:42 - 5:46)
for me to care about the story because (5:44 - 5:48)
i've definitely been burned in the past (5:46 - 5:51)
where a game starts off very story heavy (5:48 - 5:53)
and i'm like this is cool and then i (5:51 - 5:54)
start playing it and i was like i hate (5:53 - 5:56)
the way this game plays i don't know if (5:54 - 5:58)
i i don't know if i want to like i'm mad (5:56 - 6:00)
that i've invested myself in the story (5:58 - 6:01)
and now i have to suffer through the (6:00 - 6:03)
gameplay right and that was my worry (6:01 - 6:05)
with destiny when it came out and i (6:03 - 6:07)
ignored all the story stuff i got about (6:05 - 6:10)
seven eight hours into destiny and then (6:07 - 6:11)
i was like you know what i do kind of (6:10 - 6:13)
care and then i went back and i (6:11 - 6:14)
destiny's maybe the worst example (6:13 - 6:16)
because their story is so convoluted you (6:14 - 6:18)
have to go to websites and you gotta buy (6:16 - 6:19)
books but i did all that because i (6:18 - 6:21)
genuinely did end up caring about the (6:19 - 6:22)
story (6:21 - 6:25)
i will say so far in legends i'm like (6:22 - 6:27)
this is fine right like it's a pokemon (6:25 - 6:30)
story i do think the the falling out of (6:27 - 6:31)
the sky with a cell phone i thought that (6:30 - 6:33)
was a great opener (6:31 - 6:34)
there is a character on the fourth (6:33 - 6:35)
island (6:34 - 6:38)
and once i met them (6:35 - 6:40)
now i care (6:38 - 6:43)
interesting oh yeah everything and i (6:40 - 6:46)
everything changes wildly yes here's the (6:43 - 6:48)
thing and i've said i've said this to (6:46 - 6:50)
other people (6:48 - 6:50)
the story itself (6:51 - 6:55)
is (6:53 - 6:57)
pretty much a paint by numbers anime (6:55 - 7:00)
trope like they don't really stray (6:57 - 7:00)
much from (7:00 - 7:01)
[Music] (7:00 - 7:03)
what you would get out of a standard (7:01 - 7:07)
anime if you really are into world lore (7:03 - 7:10)
and pokemon lore this game is rich with (7:07 - 7:13)
story but if you only care about the (7:10 - 7:16)
main story it isn't (7:13 - 7:17)
it isn't (7:16 - 7:19)
that surprising (7:17 - 7:21)
they do through they have thrown one (7:19 - 7:23)
major curveball (7:21 - 7:26)
uh where i was like i did not expect (7:23 - 7:29)
this to happen but that's one area so (7:26 - 7:31)
far out of (7:29 - 7:33)
five that i've been to are you talking (7:31 - 7:34)
about the same area the fourth area (7:33 - 7:37)
right yeah yeah yeah (7:34 - 7:39)
there's the curveball happens there and (7:37 - 7:41)
it's not i guess it's it's a somewhat (7:39 - 7:43)
expected curveball if you thought about (7:41 - 7:45)
it a lot but (7:43 - 7:48)
the story is a paint by numbers (7:45 - 7:49)
storyline (7:48 - 7:52)
but it's the side quest and filling in (7:49 - 7:53)
the world that's really drawn me in i (7:52 - 7:55)
think they do that really well but the (7:53 - 7:57)
main plot line's pretty (7:55 - 7:59)
i don't know i don't i the thing i was (7:57 - 8:01)
thinking about too is like on the second (7:59 - 8:02)
island which i guess this is a good (8:01 - 8:04)
transition (8:02 - 8:06)
um you meet the uh (8:04 - 8:10)
like budget shadow triad like i love (8:06 - 8:13)
them oh the the the the women this is (8:10 - 8:16)
three women yeah yeah it's like chance (8:13 - 8:19)
and clover yeah yeah i say i say shadow (8:16 - 8:21)
triad because they both throw down the (8:19 - 8:23)
like smoke to disappear (8:21 - 8:25)
yeah they have they are (8:23 - 8:29)
anime ninja trope i i do like the (8:25 - 8:30)
characters are based off other (8:29 - 8:33)
characters right like the farmer guy is (8:30 - 8:35)
based off gardenia (8:33 - 8:37)
but also at the same time like i (8:35 - 8:39)
remember the candice character because (8:37 - 8:40)
that's like a big joke when we do (8:39 - 8:42)
pokemon master polls obviously she's (8:40 - 8:43)
part of the shadow triad (8:42 - 8:45)
obviously it's very candice (8:43 - 8:47)
i just can't remember their names (8:45 - 8:48)
because when i look i'm just like oh (8:47 - 8:49)
that's candace (8:48 - 8:51)
like i don't know who i don't know who (8:49 - 8:52)
the leader of the shadow triad is i just (8:51 - 8:54)
know that it's based on bertha slash (8:52 - 8:56)
agatha (8:54 - 8:58)
they have names i know but i can't (8:56 - 9:00)
remember like i don't know what the (8:58 - 9:01)
farmer dude's name is i just know that (9:00 - 9:03)
he's based off gardenia (9:01 - 9:05)
and then oh do you mean their names in (9:03 - 9:07)
the game yeah no i just literally just (9:05 - 9:09)
said there are three names chance (9:07 - 9:11)
and clover (9:09 - 9:14)
they all three start with c (9:11 - 9:15)
yep (9:14 - 9:17)
i don't know if that's like (9:15 - 9:18)
i i think one of the great parts i do (9:17 - 9:20)
like about pokemon specifically playing (9:18 - 9:22)
pokemon masters is like i know who these (9:20 - 9:24)
characters are right like well you'll (9:22 - 9:26)
learn them you'll learn them in time but (9:24 - 9:28)
does pokemon is pokemon masters going to (9:26 - 9:30)
be adding like of course because pokemon (9:28 - 9:33)
masters otherwise it's just cheryls (9:30 - 9:34)
cheryl's on top of cheryl's for all (9:33 - 9:36)
eternity (9:34 - 9:39)
the bad part about pokemon legends where (9:36 - 9:42)
is our cheryl ancestor (9:39 - 9:43)
so (9:42 - 9:46)
the whoop okay so then the woman who (9:43 - 9:48)
is the (9:46 - 9:51)
warren caretaker for (9:48 - 9:53)
ursuluna (9:51 - 9:54)
is (9:53 - 9:56)
the (9:54 - 10:00)
grass guy from kaylos (9:56 - 10:01)
is that right okay (10:00 - 10:03)
oh is that who she's supposed to be yeah (10:01 - 10:05)
she's got the same sort of pouty face (10:03 - 10:07)
the patty and she's got that big like (10:05 - 10:08)
leaf over here yeah she's got the big (10:07 - 10:10)
leaf over her head (10:08 - 10:11)
okay but there are characters where i'm (10:10 - 10:14)
like is this a new character or is this (10:11 - 10:15)
based off a character that i don't know (10:14 - 10:17)
of because when you get to basketlegian (10:15 - 10:18)
island which is the third area (10:17 - 10:22)
you have the the the darker skinned guy (10:18 - 10:25)
and he's in charge of basco legion (10:22 - 10:28)
and there's like this love relationship (10:25 - 10:29)
between (10:28 - 10:31)
because i think he's on (10:29 - 10:34)
diamond clan and then the the girl who's (10:31 - 10:35)
in charge of the growlithe she's on (10:34 - 10:36)
pearl (10:35 - 10:38)
pearl clan and they have like a love (10:36 - 10:40)
relationship and they're like oh this is (10:38 - 10:42)
forbidden love and because i'm in an (10:40 - 10:43)
interracial relationship the first thing (10:42 - 10:46)
i thought of was like oh it's because i (10:43 - 10:49)
can tell i watched that and the amount i (10:46 - 10:50)
was screaming (10:49 - 10:53)
in my own home because you're like i pay (10:50 - 10:55)
attention and they have clearly large (10:53 - 10:58)
clan symbols on their clothing they have (10:55 - 11:01)
clearly stated the entire storyline (10:58 - 11:02)
through here that they are of two (11:01 - 11:05)
different clans and you're like oh (11:02 - 11:07)
i can't believe they're in can't date (11:05 - 11:09)
because they're an interracial couple (11:07 - 11:11)
and i'm like this is why people get mad (11:09 - 11:13)
at you for not paying attention we're in (11:11 - 11:16)
the past i don't know (11:13 - 11:19)
what the rich history is (11:16 - 11:21)
i can feel for these people (11:19 - 11:23)
so going back to what greg was saying (11:21 - 11:26)
about the the environment and the story (11:23 - 11:29)
in the rich history that so one thing i (11:26 - 11:30)
noticed (11:29 - 11:32)
which i obviously haven't gotten as far (11:30 - 11:35)
as you guys is in in the diamond (11:32 - 11:36)
settlement (11:35 - 11:39)
inside one of the tents there's like (11:36 - 11:42)
paintings of a person and i'm like i (11:39 - 11:44)
don't know who this person is i didn't (11:42 - 11:45)
see any of that i didn't know you could (11:44 - 11:46)
go in the tents (11:45 - 11:47)
oh yeah i can go into everything that's (11:46 - 11:49)
the annoying thing about this game is (11:47 - 11:51)
you can't go into every building but (11:49 - 11:53)
they don't tell you (11:51 - 11:54)
oh yeah there's there's like the main (11:53 - 11:57)
tent and it's like you know we (11:54 - 11:58)
we came here (11:57 - 12:01)
from and we have like the somebody came (11:58 - 12:04)
and they were accompanied by 10 (12:01 - 12:06)
somethings (12:04 - 12:08)
and i'm like who who (12:06 - 12:12)
was it that came with 10 somethings (12:08 - 12:13)
like 10 it was like they were (12:12 - 12:16)
accompanied by 10 or something okay but (12:13 - 12:18)
going back to the basque legion guy (12:16 - 12:20)
is he a new character or is he based off (12:18 - 12:22)
somebody because if if if he's based off (12:20 - 12:23)
marlin (12:22 - 12:24)
which is the only water guy i could (12:23 - 12:26)
think of with blue hair because the the (12:24 - 12:29)
guy's like bald but he has like blue eye (12:26 - 12:30)
eyebrows (12:29 - 12:34)
but marlon's not technically brown he's (12:30 - 12:38)
white he's very tan he's whiter he's (12:34 - 12:39)
he's whiter but yes he's very tan you (12:38 - 12:42)
can tell because again his feet his feet (12:39 - 12:44)
like the joke for marlin is he's always (12:42 - 12:46)
in the sun and water and his feet are (12:44 - 12:48)
not because they're in the water (12:46 - 12:49)
so i don't i don't know i can't (12:48 - 12:51)
sometimes i can't like i thought that (12:49 - 12:52)
one girl with the leaf and the b barrel (12:51 - 12:55)
i thought she was original (12:52 - 12:57)
but if she's based off ramos i mean i (12:55 - 13:01)
guess that makes sense well i (12:57 - 13:01)
we're sort of like (13:01 - 13:06)
i guess it doesn't matter that much i (13:04 - 13:07)
think it cares a little bit like they (13:06 - 13:11)
are all based off of ideas (13:07 - 13:13)
to make parallels and that that does (13:11 - 13:15)
seem to be part of the story especially (13:13 - 13:18)
since (13:15 - 13:21)
there's a the thing that happens makes (13:18 - 13:22)
you believe that there's a lot more (13:21 - 13:24)
happening (13:22 - 13:26)
uh than these people just sort of were (13:24 - 13:27)
like hey we've moved to this strange (13:26 - 13:28)
island (13:27 - 13:31)
and it started over again i mean well if (13:28 - 13:32)
you look at (13:31 - 13:35)
archie from (13:32 - 13:36)
omega ruby (13:35 - 13:41)
ruby apple sapphire he's got darker skin (13:36 - 13:42)
he's got darker skin but he doesn't have (13:41 - 13:45)
blue hair he's got a blue (13:42 - 13:48)
he's got a blue hat pat (13:45 - 13:49)
um (13:48 - 13:50)
it's it it is (13:49 - 13:52)
wait well who's archie's uh there's like (13:50 - 13:55)
a big buff guy behind archie um archie's (13:52 - 13:59)
a big buffer guy he's a big buff guy (13:55 - 13:59)
you're thinking mac you're thinking (13:59 - 14:03)
magma with the skinny guy (14:00 - 14:05)
magma with the skinny guy no because (14:03 - 14:07)
they have two they have two admins they (14:05 - 14:09)
both have a girl admin and a boy admin (14:07 - 14:11)
and i thought the boy admin for archie (14:09 - 14:13)
was like a bigger buffer guy and then (14:11 - 14:15)
the girl admin was like (14:13 - 14:16)
the (14:15 - 14:18)
like very fancy very pretty girl that (14:16 - 14:20)
everyone likes i mean archie's the big (14:18 - 14:22)
buff guy for (14:20 - 14:25)
i thought he had a bigger buffer guy (14:22 - 14:27)
i mean it's possible (14:25 - 14:31)
[Laughter] (14:27 - 14:31)
[Music] (14:35 - 14:38)
is his name just matt yes (14:38 - 14:44)
yeah he is a bigger buffer guy (14:41 - 14:46)
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah he doesn't have (14:44 - 14:49)
blue hair though he has um (14:46 - 14:51)
his black hair i mean it is so i think (14:49 - 14:54)
shelley shelly is the girl i think part (14:51 - 14:56)
of it is (14:54 - 15:00)
they take inspiration from things (14:56 - 15:00)
in the future so like you can easily (15:00 - 15:06)
look at is ken as (15:03 - 15:08)
representing his cam that's his name (15:06 - 15:11)
team aqua (15:08 - 15:13)
and i think that sort of like they are (15:11 - 15:13)
all (15:13 - 15:17)
somewhat original characters but (15:13 - 15:21)
based off of (15:17 - 15:21)
the future world which kind of ties into (15:22 - 15:26)
the weird lore story that they're (15:24 - 15:27)
telling (15:26 - 15:28)
yeah um (15:27 - 15:30)
so i think (15:28 - 15:32)
i haven't obviously gotten to the end of (15:30 - 15:34)
the game so i'll have my wild theories (15:32 - 15:36)
then but (15:34 - 15:39)
i i think they are meant (15:36 - 15:43)
to evoke feelings of i know these (15:39 - 15:45)
characters but they aren't direct (15:43 - 15:49)
descendants of those characters (15:45 - 15:49)
like i don't know that we can i think (15:52 - 15:56)
everybody's saying like oh you'll draw a (15:54 - 15:59)
direct line from leon to clay and i (15:56 - 16:01)
don't think that that is a line that we (15:59 - 16:03)
can draw now it's probably more like (16:01 - 16:06)
parallel universes and this is like this (16:03 - 16:08)
is this universe's interpretation of (16:06 - 16:10)
that character well i haven't i i (16:08 - 16:12)
haven't finished the game either but i'm (16:10 - 16:14)
i'm uh how is that possible you've (16:12 - 16:18)
played it for like 60 hours (16:14 - 16:21)
i have hit the 60 hour mark um (16:18 - 16:21)
i like catching a lot like it is it is (16:22 - 16:28)
so enjoyable and so much fun to catch (16:24 - 16:29)
and (16:28 - 16:31)
uh when you catch a lot you you run out (16:29 - 16:33)
of resources a lot and then you have to (16:31 - 16:34)
farm and then farming leads to more (16:33 - 16:36)
catching and then you get stuck in this (16:34 - 16:38)
way the gameplay loop is very good um (16:36 - 16:40)
this whole game is incredibly good (16:38 - 16:41)
the (16:40 - 16:44)
i i guess story wise isn't it something (16:41 - 16:46)
where like the pearl clan thinks that (16:44 - 16:49)
palkia is the god and diamond clan (16:46 - 16:50)
thinks dialga is the god but neither (16:49 - 16:52)
know that arceus is god is that well (16:50 - 16:54)
they think it's sinnoh (16:52 - 16:56)
they don't use the word god they use (16:54 - 16:59)
sinnoh they use almighty sinnoh and and (16:56 - 17:00)
the (16:59 - 17:04)
diamond clan thinks sinnoh controls (17:00 - 17:05)
time (17:04 - 17:07)
and the (17:05 - 17:10)
pearl clan thinks cinno controls (17:07 - 17:12)
oh okay okay okay they think it's one (17:10 - 17:14)
creature (17:12 - 17:18)
and they have differing interpretations (17:14 - 17:19)
i think they think that they're they're (17:18 - 17:21)
they're different i think there was some (17:19 - 17:23)
text in there that said that they (17:21 - 17:25)
implied that there were different they (17:23 - 17:26)
they think of them as different (17:25 - 17:28)
creatures (17:26 - 17:31)
but one is the one that created his sui (17:28 - 17:33)
yeah they can't agree on which is the (17:31 - 17:34)
category (17:33 - 17:37)
and then you're you're neutral (17:34 - 17:39)
yes and (17:37 - 17:41)
galaxy just doesn't care at all well (17:39 - 17:45)
galaxy is their whole deal is (17:41 - 17:47)
we want to we want to keep the peace and (17:45 - 17:49)
we're not going to pick either side like (17:47 - 17:50)
we're not going to get into your (17:49 - 17:52)
religious argument but we need to make (17:50 - 17:54)
this (17:52 - 17:57)
area livable and i just like (17:54 - 18:00)
it's so hard for people who don't think (17:57 - 18:02)
about these things but just remember (18:00 - 18:04)
galaxy are (18:02 - 18:08)
the colonizers from outside (18:04 - 18:10)
they are they are new there the people (18:08 - 18:12)
the diamonds and the pearls have lived (18:10 - 18:14)
there forever for a long time galaxy's (18:12 - 18:17)
been there for about six months (18:14 - 18:21)
and they're trying to take over (18:17 - 18:22)
so (18:21 - 18:24)
i i disagree that they're trying to take (18:22 - 18:25)
over (18:24 - 18:27)
sure so (18:25 - 18:29)
every colonizer would disagree that they (18:27 - 18:31)
were trying to take over no i was here (18:29 - 18:34)
for religious freedom (18:31 - 18:34)
will made a super great point the last (18:34 - 18:38)
episode i want to bring it up again (18:36 - 18:39)
because i didn't think we spent a lot of (18:38 - 18:44)
time on it but the the concept of (18:39 - 18:46)
catching pokemon and then giving them to (18:44 - 18:47)
people (18:46 - 18:49)
is such (18:47 - 18:51)
a strong yeah (18:49 - 18:52)
i don't know what to call it like (18:51 - 18:55)
gameplay like i (18:52 - 18:58)
gave that one dude a cat the worm ball (18:55 - 18:59)
right (18:58 - 19:00)
yeah and that warmful's been there the (18:59 - 19:02)
entire time and i remember when i caught (19:00 - 19:04)
the worm pole and then i remember and (19:02 - 19:05)
then i see other people and like (19:04 - 19:07)
somebody gave (19:05 - 19:09)
that dude a shiny wormple and that (19:07 - 19:11)
wormpole will always sit out there be (19:09 - 19:12)
shiny and then somebody else gave that (19:11 - 19:14)
dude an out an alpha wormpole and then (19:12 - 19:16)
he just had a big wormpole sitting next (19:14 - 19:19)
to him and i gave the one dude in the (19:16 - 19:21)
house he wanted a parasect i gave him a (19:19 - 19:23)
big parasect and like i completely (19:21 - 19:24)
forgot about it and like two days later (19:23 - 19:26)
i went back in there and i was like oh (19:24 - 19:27)
yeah there's a huge parasite in this (19:26 - 19:29)
house it's great (19:27 - 19:32)
dude and so (19:29 - 19:32)
i'm curious about the guy because i (19:33 - 19:37)
think this happens early on (19:35 - 19:39)
you give him a whirlpool and he wants it (19:37 - 19:40)
to be (19:39 - 19:44)
a beauty fly a beauty fly (19:40 - 19:44)
that's probably the best side mission in (19:45 - 19:50)
the entire game did yours (19:46 - 19:52)
did the whirlpool you get turn into a (19:50 - 19:53)
silku (19:52 - 19:55)
i think it turns into a (19:53 - 19:57)
cast [ __ ] for everyone because the (19:55 - 19:59)
dialogue is very specific that's what i (19:57 - 20:00)
thought yeah (19:59 - 20:02)
i wasn't sure if because there's a (20:00 - 20:03)
second part of the mission where it (20:02 - 20:05)
evolved when you you give them the (20:03 - 20:06)
wormpole and it will stay wormful (20:05 - 20:09)
forever until you talk to him again (20:06 - 20:11)
and when you when you talk to him again (20:09 - 20:12)
he'll say like oh it's getting ready to (20:11 - 20:14)
evolve and then i think you just have to (20:12 - 20:16)
talk to him one more time where it does (20:14 - 20:19)
evolve and then it evolves into a (20:16 - 20:21)
cast [ __ ] for everyone (20:19 - 20:22)
and he (20:21 - 20:24)
he calls it a silcoon (20:22 - 20:27)
even though the cascoon is saying cass (20:24 - 20:28)
yeah and (20:27 - 20:30)
then (20:28 - 20:32)
something happens where i mean maybe you (20:30 - 20:33)
talk to him one more time and he goes (20:32 - 20:36)
like i'm pretty sure this is a uh he's (20:33 - 20:37)
like this is a silcoon there's no way (20:36 - 20:40)
it's not a socoon there's a quest for (20:37 - 20:40)
him (20:40 - 20:41)
[Music] (20:40 - 20:44)
in professors blackboard and that starts (20:41 - 20:46)
that storyline of him thinking that it's (20:44 - 20:49)
a silicoon and then you catch a silk he (20:46 - 20:50)
wants ultimately he wants you to catch a (20:49 - 20:52)
selkoon and so you catch a silkun and (20:50 - 20:53)
you bring it back and you put both side (20:52 - 20:55)
by side and he goes i told you they're (20:53 - 20:58)
identical they're exactly the same it's (20:55 - 21:00)
like really great (20:58 - 21:00)
and then he like he like accepts that (21:00 - 21:04)
it's a cast [ __ ] and then he like (21:02 - 21:06)
apologized to it i don't think that i (21:04 - 21:07)
don't know i haven't gotten the part (21:06 - 21:08)
where i don't know if it actually (21:07 - 21:10)
evolves though for me it's still cascan (21:08 - 21:13)
mine has evolved oh okay (21:10 - 21:15)
um but whatever that is the most (21:13 - 21:16)
important question what name did you (21:15 - 21:17)
pick (21:16 - 21:20)
i think i picked beauty fred i picked (21:17 - 21:23)
beautiful peanut friend's the best name (21:20 - 21:23)
the three names are really great too (21:24 - 21:27)
though they're all good the days are (21:26 - 21:29)
great but be the fred being a friend (21:27 - 21:32)
made me laugh when i saw it and still (21:29 - 21:35)
makes me laugh every time i see it but (21:32 - 21:36)
but that just that just that mechanic of (21:35 - 21:39)
like adding to a town which i i can't (21:36 - 21:41)
think of any other pokemon game that (21:39 - 21:44)
really has that but also not only are (21:41 - 21:46)
you catching pokemon but you're catching (21:44 - 21:47)
pokemon with the intent to give to (21:46 - 21:49)
people but also like it's it's making (21:47 - 21:52)
those memories like i remember catching (21:49 - 21:54)
this alpha krogan and i gave this alpha (21:52 - 21:56)
krogan to this girl and now it's always (21:54 - 21:58)
going to be there and i think the farm (21:56 - 22:00)
is even even better example because you (21:58 - 22:03)
can put your pokemon to do something (22:00 - 22:05)
like the farm has i think three or four (22:03 - 22:06)
pokemon where they want like i want a (22:05 - 22:07)
water pokemon here i want a ground (22:06 - 22:09)
pokemon here and i want to pokemon with (22:07 - 22:12)
rocksmash here and i can give the farm (22:09 - 22:14)
like like somebody gave their farm an (22:12 - 22:16)
alpha torterra an alpha (22:14 - 22:19)
infernape and an alpha empoleon (22:16 - 22:20)
and so you have these three towering (22:19 - 22:22)
pokemon on their farm (22:20 - 22:24)
but like i was like oh i have more than (22:22 - 22:27)
i have i have more than seven chinese or (22:24 - 22:29)
six chinese i can only hold seven (22:27 - 22:31)
chinese in my party so i'm going to put (22:29 - 22:33)
my out i'm gonna put my shiny golem on (22:31 - 22:36)
the farm so he's not living in a pc so (22:33 - 22:37)
now at least we're gonna get it but you (22:36 - 22:39)
can see the ones you put into the (22:37 - 22:41)
pasture too (22:39 - 22:42)
yeah but but when you run to your farm (22:41 - 22:44)
to pick up the stuff which you should be (22:42 - 22:47)
doing like it's cool (22:44 - 22:50)
what's up gollum good to see you um (22:47 - 22:51)
i love it i love it i think it's a (22:50 - 22:52)
really great thing because it makes the (22:51 - 22:54)
world (22:52 - 22:56)
alive and it makes you feel like your (22:54 - 22:58)
choices matter (22:56 - 22:59)
yes and that's like (22:58 - 23:02)
what is a hallmark of a good game (22:59 - 23:04)
for me currently (23:02 - 23:06)
is i want to feel that the choices that (23:04 - 23:10)
i make have an impact and it's something (23:06 - 23:12)
you get so minimally in other pokemon (23:10 - 23:14)
games right right i can't think of an (23:12 - 23:17)
i can only think of like (23:14 - 23:19)
black and white two that did some of (23:17 - 23:21)
that yeah what you did carried over and (23:19 - 23:23)
it made black and white to feel more (23:21 - 23:26)
like my continuation of a game (23:23 - 23:28)
i guess you could argue like secret (23:26 - 23:29)
bases and gen 3 was kind of like that (23:28 - 23:30)
but (23:29 - 23:32)
but somebody had to come and visit yeah (23:30 - 23:33)
but you had to come (23:32 - 23:34)
but (23:33 - 23:37)
your secret base really didn't alter the (23:34 - 23:39)
fundamental society of the world right (23:37 - 23:41)
like i couldn't (23:39 - 23:43)
give (23:41 - 23:44)
uh (23:43 - 23:47)
like flannery a bunch of fire type and (23:44 - 23:49)
then come back and have her being (23:47 - 23:51)
have her use those and say hey these are (23:49 - 23:53)
working out great or you know whatever (23:51 - 23:54)
like that (23:53 - 23:56)
that level of interaction and being a (23:54 - 23:58)
part of the world is one of the (23:56 - 24:01)
strongest parts of legends arceus and (23:58 - 24:05)
why i i am very sold on this game (24:01 - 24:07)
yeah i would love to see them take it a (24:05 - 24:09)
little bit more advanced where yes you (24:07 - 24:12)
can switch out pokemon um with everyone (24:09 - 24:14)
but also like more people request (24:12 - 24:15)
pokemon more pokemon existing and the (24:14 - 24:18)
pokemon you give even matter like it (24:15 - 24:20)
would be really cool where the farm (24:18 - 24:23)
specifically like hey if i put (24:20 - 24:24)
more (24:23 - 24:26)
grass-type pokemon things grow faster if (24:24 - 24:28)
i put more water type pokemon things (24:26 - 24:29)
grow (24:28 - 24:30)
slower but bigger or something i don't (24:29 - 24:32)
know how farming works but (24:30 - 24:35)
like the choices you put (24:32 - 24:38)
like effect the like hey this this (24:35 - 24:41)
uh nurse if you give her um you know a (24:38 - 24:43)
crow gunk she's better at healing for (24:41 - 24:46)
poison if you give her a chancey she (24:43 - 24:47)
just heals you more or something like (24:46 - 24:49)
that it would be backaches (24:47 - 24:50)
yeah (24:49 - 24:51)
um (24:50 - 24:55)
i would like to see (24:51 - 24:55)
that (24:55 - 24:58)
continue i would like to see like if (24:56 - 24:59)
side quests continue because they (24:58 - 25:01)
started doing side quests a little in (24:59 - 25:03)
sun and moon (25:01 - 25:04)
but like when you fulfilled those side (25:03 - 25:06)
quests things changed in the things that (25:04 - 25:09)
you did hung around i would love to see (25:06 - 25:11)
that make its way forward (25:09 - 25:13)
yeah i yeah i think people (25:11 - 25:16)
i think the like discussion i hear is (25:13 - 25:19)
you know i want the catching mechanic (25:16 - 25:20)
and everything to come back for future (25:19 - 25:22)
games i want the open worldness to come (25:20 - 25:24)
back for future games and well while i (25:22 - 25:25)
agree (25:24 - 25:27)
i think legends is doing a lot of like (25:25 - 25:28)
these smaller things like giving (25:27 - 25:30)
characters pokemon which which like that (25:28 - 25:32)
also needs to come back that adds so (25:30 - 25:35)
much personality and (25:32 - 25:38)
it makes the world feel (25:35 - 25:38)
vibrant it makes the world feel (25:39 - 25:44)
like i'm actually living in a world (25:42 - 25:46)
where pokemon aren't just fighting (25:44 - 25:48)
machines but but it's also it's like the (25:46 - 25:50)
animal crossing-ness of it right yeah i (25:48 - 25:53)
am building my own village with like (25:50 - 25:55)
these are the parts that it's very (25:53 - 25:56)
limited but these are the parts that i (25:55 - 25:58)
get to insert and it's a reflection of (25:56 - 25:59)
me (25:58 - 26:01)
yeah and i could even see people playing (25:59 - 26:02)
through the game being like my (26:01 - 26:04)
playthrough is going to be try to get (26:02 - 26:06)
all these villagers shiny pokemon or get (26:04 - 26:07)
all these villagers alpha pokemon like (26:06 - 26:09)
it kind of gives you like your own (26:07 - 26:10)
challenge to do if you wanted to play (26:09 - 26:12)
through it again i mean even a future (26:10 - 26:14)
game just had like a pocapella go where (26:12 - 26:16)
i had control of an island and the (26:14 - 26:20)
people there and i gave them things and (26:16 - 26:22)
that world changed even it wasn't (26:20 - 26:24)
everywhere in the world but like my own (26:22 - 26:26)
thing like i could i really need to (26:24 - 26:28)
hatch eggs so i'm going to swap out this (26:26 - 26:30)
pokemon to make that better like those (26:28 - 26:31)
type of things i would like to see come (26:30 - 26:34)
forward (26:31 - 26:34)
uh speaking of shiny pokemon there is a (26:34 - 26:39)
shiny hunting method in this game uh (26:36 - 26:40)
don't matter (26:39 - 26:43)
so so there's a couple things uh going i (26:40 - 26:45)
will say and i've said this on my (26:43 - 26:46)
streams (26:45 - 26:49)
that (26:46 - 26:49)
the reason we know shiny hunting stuff (26:49 - 26:53)
exists is because of data miners they (26:51 - 26:55)
have been wrong before in the past they (26:53 - 26:57)
were wrong with sword and shield for the (26:55 - 26:59)
first two months they kept changing and (26:57 - 27:01)
then as we discovered recently they were (26:59 - 27:02)
wrong for pretty much two years for (27:01 - 27:04)
sword and shield you know it took over a (27:02 - 27:07)
month to figure out sos technically (27:04 - 27:09)
properly uh people just kind of do what (27:07 - 27:11)
feels to be right and if it works it (27:09 - 27:13)
works and then maybe we refine that in (27:11 - 27:15)
the future so just a little side note of (27:13 - 27:17)
you know maybe in like five episodes (27:15 - 27:18)
we're gonna be like well that was wrong (27:17 - 27:20)
uh here's the right way to do it yeah (27:18 - 27:22)
um but so we know a couple things we (27:20 - 27:24)
know that if you get a (27:22 - 27:27)
uh a pokemon dex research to 10 it's (27:24 - 27:28)
supposed to give you a plus one extra (27:27 - 27:30)
roll so instead of a one and four (27:28 - 27:31)
thousand chance it's a two and four (27:30 - 27:33)
thousand chance and then if you get it (27:31 - 27:34)
to perfect it gives you i believe (27:33 - 27:36)
another plus two (27:34 - 27:38)
uh which combined with that that's like (27:36 - 27:40)
a plus three so ultimately getting a (27:38 - 27:42)
pokemon to perfect in the decks should (27:40 - 27:45)
give you ideally a one in one thousand (27:42 - 27:46)
chance (27:45 - 27:47)
of (27:46 - 27:49)
finding a perfect or a shiny pokemon (27:47 - 27:51)
that's what i have in front of me in my (27:49 - 27:52)
notes (27:51 - 27:55)
um and then there is the shiny charm so (27:52 - 27:56)
in every so the shiny charm was (27:55 - 27:58)
introduced in one of the greatest (27:56 - 27:59)
pokemon games ever made that is called (27:58 - 28:03)
pokemon black 2 and pokemon white 2 and (27:59 - 28:05)
um (28:03 - 28:05)
and that gave you a plus two role (28:05 - 28:11)
now in black two white two the odds were (28:09 - 28:12)
still one in eight thousand and then (28:11 - 28:14)
they changed it to one in four thousand (28:12 - 28:16)
in x and y and so it's been plus two (28:14 - 28:18)
ever since now in this game the shining (28:16 - 28:20)
charm is a plus three (28:18 - 28:21)
but it's a little bit more tedious to (28:20 - 28:23)
get in order to get the shining charm (28:21 - 28:25)
not only do you have to catch all 240 40 (28:23 - 28:27)
pokemon in the game (28:25 - 28:29)
not counting the two mythicals can you (28:27 - 28:33)
just give me credit for my guess of 250 (28:29 - 28:35)
yes you guys are only 10 off yeah you it (28:33 - 28:36)
looks like the price is right you didn't (28:35 - 28:38)
go above (28:36 - 28:39)
um (28:38 - 28:41)
so you need 240 pokemon to complete the (28:39 - 28:43)
decks in order to get the shiny charm (28:41 - 28:46)
you need the 240 pokemon and you need (28:43 - 28:48)
all of them to be research level 10 (28:46 - 28:51)
which might sound like a lot (28:48 - 28:52)
it's not that hard because the research (28:51 - 28:54)
level is usually to get it to 10 it's (28:52 - 28:56)
usually like catch three of the pokemon (28:54 - 28:57)
it's like when you find them there's (28:56 - 28:59)
usually three of them right there so (28:57 - 29:01)
the thing that i didn't that i didn't (28:59 - 29:03)
realize (29:01 - 29:04)
at first is (29:03 - 29:06)
if you look at the pokedex the things (29:04 - 29:09)
that have the two red up arrows that (29:06 - 29:10)
line (29:09 - 29:12)
they count as two points towards the (29:10 - 29:13)
research (29:12 - 29:15)
instead of one (29:13 - 29:18)
so like a lot of them have catch (29:15 - 29:20)
this line so if you catch the number (29:18 - 29:23)
like you know like some of them is 25 (29:20 - 29:25)
that's a five line thing but it's almost (29:23 - 29:27)
always two up so as long as you catch (29:25 - 29:29)
that many you're going to get the 10. (29:27 - 29:31)
like it sounds worse than it is but if (29:29 - 29:33)
you can pay attention to what on the (29:31 - 29:36)
deck's entry what the boosted things are (29:33 - 29:38)
and just do those (29:36 - 29:41)
you get to 10 real fast yeah (29:38 - 29:42)
perfect so (29:41 - 29:44)
ultimately another thing (29:42 - 29:47)
so ultimately if you get the shiny charm (29:44 - 29:48)
which means you have to get research (29:47 - 29:50)
level 10 of everything you can't get the (29:48 - 29:52)
shiny charm without getting the research (29:50 - 29:53)
level 10. (29:52 - 29:56)
uh you would have a one (29:53 - 29:59)
in 819 chance of finding a shiny (29:56 - 30:01)
um (29:59 - 30:03)
if you just decide like you don't care (30:01 - 30:04)
about chinese but you specifically only (30:03 - 30:06)
want rosalia so you ignore everything (30:04 - 30:08)
else and you just focus on rosalia you (30:06 - 30:10)
would have a and you get the resilient (30:08 - 30:12)
to perfect you would have a one in a (30:10 - 30:13)
thousand chance (30:12 - 30:15)
of that rosalia (30:13 - 30:16)
just walking around the overworld these (30:15 - 30:19)
are like standard odds (30:16 - 30:21)
and then finally if you perfected your (30:19 - 30:23)
pokedex everything is perfect i believe (30:21 - 30:24)
you do get something i don't know what (30:23 - 30:26)
that item is i didn't look it up uh but (30:24 - 30:30)
it would be a one in 585 chance of a (30:26 - 30:32)
pokemon to be shiny which is not as good (30:30 - 30:34)
as sword and shield i believe sword and (30:32 - 30:37)
shield was a one in (30:34 - 30:40)
555 or something with the brilliant but (30:37 - 30:42)
that was only specifically brilliant and (30:40 - 30:44)
whatever the whatever that is doesn't (30:42 - 30:45)
matter (30:44 - 30:47)
or maybe what (30:45 - 30:49)
none of this matters that much (30:47 - 30:51)
the method (30:49 - 30:52)
none of this matters because chinese are (30:51 - 30:55)
50 50. it's either shiny or it's not (30:52 - 30:57)
i am fundamentally i am hunting for a (30:55 - 30:59)
shiny (30:57 - 31:00)
alpha (30:59 - 31:02)
buddhu or azalea (31:00 - 31:04)
and i thought (31:02 - 31:06)
alpha badou was a standard like it was (31:04 - 31:08)
always going to be there and it was very (31:06 - 31:10)
wrong (31:08 - 31:11)
it is not (31:10 - 31:14)
and my life is terrible can we just say (31:11 - 31:15)
that the (31:14 - 31:17)
alpha badou (31:15 - 31:19)
it just looks (31:17 - 31:20)
wrong (31:19 - 31:22)
oh he's a thing have you seen alpha (31:20 - 31:25)
starly that's a good one too yeah (31:22 - 31:27)
alphabet (31:25 - 31:28)
makes me laugh (31:27 - 31:31)
every time i see it spit with his little (31:28 - 31:33)
angry eyes coming at me the red eyes (31:31 - 31:34)
yeah (31:33 - 31:37)
bring it bring it let's be friends (31:34 - 31:39)
so the shiny hunting method in this game (31:37 - 31:42)
is called mass outbreak (31:39 - 31:44)
i did a whole 15 minute video on youtube (31:42 - 31:46)
right now that you can see how it works (31:44 - 31:48)
i walk you through it i walk i also walk (31:46 - 31:49)
you through (31:48 - 31:52)
and prove that if you save where i tell (31:49 - 31:54)
you to save and if you mess it up if you (31:52 - 31:56)
mess the shiny up (31:54 - 31:58)
you can still get it back and then i (31:56 - 32:01)
also proved that if you save (31:58 - 32:04)
where i told you not to save you have a (32:01 - 32:06)
very you have a small chance of losing (32:04 - 32:08)
the shiny um (32:06 - 32:10)
greg is shaking his head for the audio (32:08 - 32:12)
only listeners what what is the issue uh (32:10 - 32:17)
okay i was following your method okay i (32:12 - 32:19)
was hunting pikachu (32:17 - 32:21)
uh-huh there wasn't a pikachu in the (32:19 - 32:23)
back (32:21 - 32:26)
i reset my game (32:23 - 32:28)
i went back to the professor (32:26 - 32:30)
said take me back to village because i (32:28 - 32:32)
need a new batch (32:30 - 32:35)
when i went to my mass outbreak (32:32 - 32:38)
pikachu was now a wormhole outbreak (32:35 - 32:40)
yes that can't happen (32:38 - 32:44)
you did not say that in your video (32:40 - 32:44)
whispered (32:45 - 32:50)
liar you said it will stay there and it (32:46 - 32:52)
did not and i got a shiny whimple (32:50 - 32:54)
instead of a shiny pikachu and this is (32:52 - 32:57)
your fault you owe me a shiny pikachu (32:54 - 33:00)
it's a little banner that comes up in my (32:57 - 33:02)
video and says it's possible for these (33:00 - 33:05)
to change mr i don't read things i do (33:02 - 33:08)
need to say it out loud but i did false (33:05 - 33:11)
advertising did right here right now go (33:08 - 33:12)
put uh (33:11 - 33:14)
there's like no (33:12 - 33:16)
video that says so hey if it does change (33:14 - 33:19)
you can just reset and try to re-roll (33:16 - 33:21)
for that pikachu again but yes that's (33:19 - 33:23)
the one like (33:21 - 33:25)
not a gripe but i am so mad at you you (33:23 - 33:28)
cannot specifically control what you're (33:25 - 33:30)
hunting for right like if i if i booted (33:28 - 33:31)
up the game today and was like i want to (33:30 - 33:34)
hunt for gumi i have no way of telling (33:31 - 33:35)
the game that i just kind of have to (33:34 - 33:37)
keep resetting until gumi appears (33:35 - 33:40)
you don't have to talk to ress (33:37 - 33:42)
you don't have to talk to russ (33:40 - 33:43)
technically but you do because he's (33:42 - 33:45)
going to talk to you when he's attacking (33:43 - 33:47)
you but if you're in jubilee village and (33:45 - 33:49)
you just go out to the overworld map it (33:47 - 33:51)
will show you if there's an outbreak (33:49 - 33:54)
without talking yeah (33:51 - 33:56)
unless unless i there's something that (33:54 - 33:58)
unlocks you have to pass yeah you do (33:56 - 34:00)
have to pass him and he will tell you he (33:58 - 34:02)
will tell you but i'm just saying (34:00 - 34:05)
another falsehood in your so-called (34:02 - 34:08)
video you can't because you have to talk (34:05 - 34:10)
duress he he's like that he's like that (34:08 - 34:12)
hotel you know greeter (34:10 - 34:15)
you gotta talk to him every time (34:12 - 34:16)
wait while we're on the topic of (34:15 - 34:18)
falsehoods coming from steve i just want (34:16 - 34:21)
a clarification okay because i think you (34:18 - 34:24)
guys had a little memory mishap um (34:21 - 34:26)
distortions do not (34:24 - 34:30)
appear until you unlock the second area (34:26 - 34:32)
then distortion is not true this is not (34:30 - 34:35)
true i note i did not get the pop-up (34:32 - 34:37)
that said hey this is what a distortion (34:35 - 34:40)
is until i unlocked the second area (34:37 - 34:41)
everyone gets the pop-up on the second (34:40 - 34:43)
area yeah (34:41 - 34:45)
i didn't even get to cleaver and i got (34:43 - 34:46)
like seven distortions before clever (34:45 - 34:48)
yeah you can get them before but i still (34:46 - 34:50)
think it's tied to your star level (34:48 - 34:53)
i had a real so i had a really high yeah (34:50 - 34:54)
it's really dumb (34:53 - 34:55)
because they don't they don't tell you (34:54 - 34:57)
they don't think about it (34:55 - 34:59)
also somebody called it a giant soap (34:57 - 35:01)
bubble and i can't stop thinking about (34:59 - 35:02)
that (35:01 - 35:05)
called it a what a soap bubble well yeah (35:02 - 35:08)
it's a dome because it ha anyways (35:05 - 35:10)
um i can't direct in those places all (35:08 - 35:13)
the time it is very stressful you know (35:10 - 35:16)
distortions would be great in pogo like (35:13 - 35:19)
if you could see on the map that there's (35:16 - 35:21)
a distortion happening in a park and you (35:19 - 35:24)
walk to that part that would be cool and (35:21 - 35:26)
the park has different spawns because (35:24 - 35:27)
visually on the map there's the (35:26 - 35:30)
distortion that would be incredible i'd (35:27 - 35:32)
be in for that that'd be cool um (35:30 - 35:34)
especially for communities make more (35:32 - 35:35)
interesting anyways steve is a liar (35:34 - 35:37)
moving on anyways so if you want to see (35:35 - 35:38)
how to shiny hunt that is up on my (35:37 - 35:39)
youtube (35:38 - 35:42)
um put giant asterisks in the comments (35:39 - 35:45)
there's not there's little there i i i (35:42 - 35:47)
thought of it all i don't know (35:45 - 35:50)
i spent so long in the video and you (35:47 - 35:53)
left out vital information (35:50 - 35:53)
here's the thing about the mass outbreak (35:53 - 35:56)
odds though that i want to talk about so (35:55 - 35:58)
a base rate mass outbreak so this is (35:56 - 36:00)
like you can do mass outbreak you know (35:58 - 36:02)
right right right before cleaver if you (36:00 - 36:05)
wanted to if it pops up you can do it um (36:02 - 36:07)
i believe you just have to be two stars (36:05 - 36:09)
in order to get a mass outbreak um to (36:07 - 36:11)
appear (36:09 - 36:12)
i show you how to reset for a mass (36:11 - 36:13)
outbreak if you want to just start (36:12 - 36:16)
hunting the odds of that is one in 158 (36:13 - 36:18)
and then we'll just skip everything in (36:16 - 36:20)
the middle if you have a perfect pokedex (36:18 - 36:23)
plus the shiny charm your odds for a (36:20 - 36:24)
shiny in a mass outbreak would be one in (36:23 - 36:28)
128. now i've seen the discussions of (36:24 - 36:29)
this game is the easiest pokemon game to (36:28 - 36:32)
shiny hunt in um but i've also been (36:29 - 36:33)
around on the internet where people have (36:32 - 36:35)
said that for literally every pokemon (36:33 - 36:37)
game that has come out uh when x and y (36:35 - 36:38)
came out (36:37 - 36:40)
people were like oh my gosh chain (36:38 - 36:42)
fishing is so broken and every chinese (36:40 - 36:45)
are so easy and they guess chain fishing (36:42 - 36:46)
is one in (36:45 - 36:48)
one in one in that i think it's one in a (36:46 - 36:50)
hundred it's either one or two (36:48 - 36:53)
or things that can be caught by fishing (36:50 - 36:55)
correct so even though like yes chain (36:53 - 36:58)
fishing is one in a hundred there's only (36:55 - 37:00)
like 20 pokemon that you can change for (36:58 - 37:03)
so this conversation of oh my gosh (37:00 - 37:05)
either and it's whatever it's like (37:03 - 37:07)
chinese are devalued chinese are too (37:05 - 37:09)
easy they're just handing out chinese (37:07 - 37:11)
this that this the conversation that's (37:09 - 37:13)
happening around legends with mass (37:11 - 37:14)
outbreaks is the same conversation we (37:13 - 37:17)
had for x and y now to uh you know bring (37:14 - 37:19)
up everyone's memory it's the same (37:17 - 37:21)
conversation we had offer ultrasound (37:19 - 37:22)
ultramoon in the ultra wormholes oh my (37:21 - 37:25)
gosh they made chinese so easy (37:22 - 37:28)
once again there's only 20 shinies in (37:25 - 37:30)
the ultra wormhole yeah but they really (37:28 - 37:35)
made shinies easy in dynamaxx adventures (37:30 - 37:37)
you know in dynamics adventures uh it's (37:35 - 37:38)
a one in a hundred chance yes that is (37:37 - 37:40)
correct with so assuming you have shiny (37:38 - 37:44)
charm they ruin chinese with pogo so (37:40 - 37:48)
here's the thing about mass outbreaks um (37:44 - 37:48)
you cannot control it it's like change (37:48 - 37:52)
it's like (37:50 - 37:53)
dynamics adventure (37:52 - 37:56)
it's like the ultra wormhole it's like (37:53 - 37:58)
yeah chain fishing you can kind of (37:56 - 37:59)
control chain fishing you can control (37:58 - 38:01)
the three but like a lot of the chain (37:59 - 38:04)
fishing stuff was like 60 (38:01 - 38:06)
thirty five percent five percent so if (38:04 - 38:07)
you're going for the five percent you're (38:06 - 38:08)
probably gonna get like eighteen shiny (38:07 - 38:10)
horses before you get that fight that (38:08 - 38:13)
that five percent (38:10 - 38:15)
you can't specifically control (38:13 - 38:16)
the mass outbreak yes you can keep (38:15 - 38:19)
resetting until you get the one you want (38:16 - 38:21)
but again (38:19 - 38:23)
you know if i boot up my game today and (38:21 - 38:24)
i want gumi (38:23 - 38:27)
i might see krika tot cricketoon (38:24 - 38:30)
b-barrel gold duck (38:27 - 38:34)
whatever else before i get the goomy one (38:30 - 38:36)
and (38:34 - 38:36)
the one in 158 is is a great (38:36 - 38:43)
odds i mean i've i'm up to like 12 (38:40 - 38:45)
13 chinese in the game after five days (38:43 - 38:46)
and most of them are i think three of (38:45 - 38:48)
them are just random but most of them (38:46 - 38:49)
are mass outbreak (38:48 - 38:52)
but some mass outbreaks (38:49 - 38:53)
are awful (38:52 - 38:54)
they (38:53 - 38:56)
suck (38:54 - 38:59)
like pikachu is not fun yeah pikachu i (38:56 - 39:01)
did pikachu it was it was not fun i was (38:59 - 39:02)
very lucky pikachu it was my first four (39:01 - 39:04)
but the other three pikachu were very (39:02 - 39:06)
upset that i was there (39:04 - 39:09)
um surprisingly silcoon is like i don't (39:06 - 39:11)
know why you would ever do silkun just (39:09 - 39:13)
do wormpole three like just do one i (39:11 - 39:14)
guess maybe you're you could be go and (39:13 - 39:16)
you're still [ __ ] or your wormful could (39:14 - 39:19)
evolve into three cast goons but (39:16 - 39:21)
like the silcoon outbreak awful i think (39:19 - 39:24)
the worst outbreak i've done is psyduck (39:21 - 39:26)
for whatever reason oh i had to decide (39:24 - 39:28)
that quantity that was bad the you (39:26 - 39:30)
cannot throw this is why the third area (39:28 - 39:32)
in the game is bad (39:30 - 39:34)
because it's a water area (39:32 - 39:38)
if if your pokeball hits the water (39:34 - 39:40)
you don't it does you have to hit the (39:38 - 39:42)
pokemon in like the like 10 of its head (39:40 - 39:46)
that is showing up so since the psyduck (39:42 - 39:48)
outbreak in the second area is in the (39:46 - 39:51)
swamp and they're all four in the water (39:48 - 39:54)
it's really hard to hit them and you (39:51 - 39:55)
have to like bring them out of the water (39:54 - 39:58)
with berries the targeting doesn't help (39:55 - 39:59)
with that (39:58 - 40:00)
it (39:59 - 40:02)
the auto targeting seems to go for their (40:00 - 40:04)
body always yeah it goes for the body so (40:02 - 40:06)
you have to tilt you have to target it (40:04 - 40:08)
and tilt it up to hit them in the head (40:06 - 40:10)
forget it forget it yeah and they get (40:08 - 40:12)
frustrated they get the side ducks get (40:10 - 40:14)
mad they get mad (40:12 - 40:16)
and when you when you finally catch like (40:14 - 40:18)
so how a mouse break also works is like (40:16 - 40:20)
there's usually like 12 in a group so (40:18 - 40:22)
you catch you catch one another one pops (40:20 - 40:23)
up so ideally you catch four then four (40:22 - 40:25)
more pop up and then you do that one (40:23 - 40:26)
more time (40:25 - 40:28)
um with psyduck (40:26 - 40:29)
you have to like (40:28 - 40:31)
fish them out of the water with berries (40:29 - 40:32)
and then catch them and then the new (40:31 - 40:34)
ones spawn in the water again and you (40:32 - 40:36)
have to do the same thing over and good (40:34 - 40:39)
luck making sure none of them get mad (40:36 - 40:40)
because once they get mad you're just (40:39 - 40:41)
like (40:40 - 40:43)
i was i was doing a psyduck because i (40:41 - 40:46)
just wanted to complete the pokedex and (40:43 - 40:46)
and (40:46 - 40:49)
at the near the end when they were all (40:46 - 40:50)
mad at me the one that spawned was an (40:49 - 40:52)
alpha (40:50 - 40:57)
who was also very mad at me (40:52 - 40:57)
so (40:57 - 41:00)
i don't think they're handing out (41:01 - 41:05)
chinese i don't think that like shiny (41:03 - 41:07)
hunting is ruined i do think the shiny (41:05 - 41:10)
hunting method is fun i do think it's (41:07 - 41:11)
easy (41:10 - 41:12)
i don't know if it's as easy as (41:11 - 41:15)
something as like sos because sos was (41:12 - 41:18)
one in 252 (41:15 - 41:21)
for odds sos was you could set that up (41:18 - 41:23)
like a machine it was like a set it and (41:21 - 41:24)
forget it type thing (41:23 - 41:27)
yeah and sos i think is really easy to (41:24 - 41:29)
explain to somebody it is (41:27 - 41:31)
pick a pokemon (41:29 - 41:33)
wait for it to call in (41:31 - 41:35)
keep knocking out switch if you need to (41:33 - 41:36)
like you can get really advanced with (41:35 - 41:38)
sos and you could be like well false (41:36 - 41:41)
swipe blep a berry harvest switch like (41:38 - 41:42)
you can get very advanced with it but (41:41 - 41:43)
for (41:42 - 41:46)
um like like irene she sos successfully (41:43 - 41:47)
four or five pokemon and she didn't know (41:46 - 41:49)
any of those tricks it was just like (41:47 - 41:50)
false swipe the first one knock out the (41:49 - 41:52)
next one look at your watch maybe after (41:50 - 41:54)
30 minutes you know switch the two (41:52 - 41:55)
around (41:54 - 41:58)
and she got she got a scuffle she got a (41:55 - 42:00)
a rock rough she she got a bunch like it (41:58 - 42:02)
was very easy to do (42:00 - 42:04)
and i think for the most part let's go (42:02 - 42:05)
pikachu let's go eevee was pretty easy (42:04 - 42:07)
for a lot of people to do i think mass (42:05 - 42:09)
outbreaks is a little (42:07 - 42:12)
more complicated depending on the hunt (42:09 - 42:15)
like example psyduck sucks so [ __ ] sucks (42:12 - 42:17)
like there are some pokemon where if you (42:15 - 42:18)
catch one no matter what they're all (42:17 - 42:20)
getting angry yeah and you gotta deal (42:18 - 42:22)
with that they have to deal with it uh i (42:20 - 42:24)
mean to be fair if you can time it right (42:22 - 42:26)
you can throw a high level pokemon in (42:24 - 42:28)
the middle of them (42:26 - 42:30)
and then as they're all focused on your (42:28 - 42:33)
pokemon pick them off one by one (42:30 - 42:35)
which is what i was doing for pikachu (42:33 - 42:38)
before uh a youtuber lied to me and my (42:35 - 42:39)
pikachu (42:38 - 42:40)
not lie to you hey (42:39 - 42:44)
i i i don't think they they do well the (42:40 - 42:45)
game does give you a free shine it gives (42:44 - 42:47)
you a free shiny ponyta which is cool (42:45 - 42:50)
it's whatever it's nice yeah um (42:47 - 42:52)
i mean i'm hunting a shiny alpha so my (42:50 - 42:53)
life is over (42:52 - 42:55)
i think they're still trying to find (42:53 - 42:58)
that balance of like what is (42:55 - 42:59)
what is (42:58 - 43:01)
what is too generous for chinese and (42:59 - 43:04)
what is not generous enough but also (43:01 - 43:05)
i think at the end of the day it doesn't (43:04 - 43:08)
matter because somebody who is into (43:05 - 43:10)
shiny hunting is going to min max the (43:08 - 43:11)
system right like what is the most (43:10 - 43:13)
efficient way that i can get the most (43:11 - 43:15)
number of chinese yeah definitely (43:13 - 43:17)
and if you're just a person who is (43:15 - 43:19)
playing through the game which is (43:17 - 43:22)
probably the majority of pokemon fans (43:19 - 43:24)
it is (43:22 - 43:26)
it is nice for those people to get maybe (43:24 - 43:27)
one or two while playing through the (43:26 - 43:29)
game and not putting a lot of effort in (43:27 - 43:30)
for as many people coming into my twitch (43:29 - 43:32)
streams being like i'm up to five i'm up (43:30 - 43:35)
to six i'm up to seven chinese there is (43:32 - 43:37)
an equal amount of people that are like (43:35 - 43:40)
i've played this game for 40 hours i (43:37 - 43:42)
haven't seen one what am i doing wrong (43:40 - 43:43)
and it's you know you're not doing (43:42 - 43:44)
anything wrong it's it's just luck and (43:43 - 43:46)
the people who are saying they're (43:44 - 43:47)
getting five six seven (43:46 - 43:48)
they're (43:47 - 43:51)
they're trying to find them yeah (43:48 - 43:52)
um (43:51 - 43:55)
and i would say i'm very torn between (43:52 - 43:56)
trying to find them and (43:55 - 43:59)
finish the game because i get real sick (43:56 - 44:00)
of (43:59 - 44:03)
doing that grind real fast (44:00 - 44:04)
and then i'm like don't want to burn (44:03 - 44:06)
yourself out (44:04 - 44:08)
this is what i've been doing because i (44:06 - 44:09)
i've also felt like i just want to (44:08 - 44:11)
finish the story but also like an (44:09 - 44:13)
outbreak is appearing if you don't want (44:11 - 44:14)
to burn yourself out this is what i (44:13 - 44:16)
suggest if you see an outbreak (44:14 - 44:17)
prioritize it just do it don't worry (44:16 - 44:19)
about resetting if you get a shiny great (44:17 - 44:21)
if not you've only you've only spent (44:19 - 44:22)
like five or six minutes and then and (44:21 - 44:24)
the the (44:22 - 44:25)
you you've probably got that to level (44:24 - 44:27)
10. yeah (44:25 - 44:29)
and you need to do that for completing (44:27 - 44:30)
the pokedex because if you catch all of (44:29 - 44:32)
them generally you're going to get a (44:30 - 44:34)
complete on that (44:32 - 44:37)
on that dex entry which only serves (44:34 - 44:38)
you (44:37 - 44:41)
good it's only a good thing (44:38 - 44:41)
speaking of bad things (44:42 - 44:47)
the battle system is (44:45 - 44:49)
bad (44:47 - 44:50)
and we talked about it a little bit last (44:49 - 44:51)
week what do you mean by battle system (44:50 - 44:53)
like trainer battles or just battling (44:51 - 44:55)
pokemon in general (44:53 - 44:57)
both because they're like the same (44:55 - 45:00)
okay (44:57 - 45:00)
i i was (45:00 - 45:04)
i i strongly feel (45:04 - 45:08)
that (45:07 - 45:11)
they were too timid in the implement (45:08 - 45:14)
implementation of this battle system (45:11 - 45:17)
i feel like (45:14 - 45:18)
as a company they're like we really want (45:17 - 45:21)
to try something new (45:18 - 45:24)
but if we make it super complicated it (45:21 - 45:26)
will turn (45:24 - 45:29)
people off so they went too far in the (45:26 - 45:30)
other way (45:29 - 45:34)
and it's it's not (45:30 - 45:34)
it's not great it's not (45:34 - 45:38)
it's just like there (45:36 - 45:42)
i mean i use it but i'm never like (45:38 - 45:44)
we (45:42 - 45:44)
um (45:44 - 45:48)
yeah i i think it's bad for for a lot of (45:45 - 45:50)
reasons and i i said this last week and (45:48 - 45:52)
i'll say this you know going forward i (45:50 - 45:54)
always will applaud come this company (45:52 - 45:56)
for trying something new (45:54 - 45:58)
and when they do something new and it (45:56 - 46:00)
works man it is a home run and when they (45:58 - 46:03)
do something new and it doesn't work (46:00 - 46:05)
it they really like you just you just (46:03 - 46:07)
can't help but think like (46:05 - 46:10)
you did this well before how did you (46:07 - 46:12)
drop the ball (46:10 - 46:13)
this game (46:12 - 46:16)
wants the battle system to be easy (46:13 - 46:18)
enough for i think any new pokemon fan (46:16 - 46:19)
to jump in (46:18 - 46:22)
but i think they fumble the ball so hard (46:19 - 46:24)
and and actually make it more (46:22 - 46:27)
complicated than it needs to be (46:24 - 46:29)
like like when you first this is the (46:27 - 46:31)
first pokemon game (46:29 - 46:32)
where (46:31 - 46:34)
they're like here's a whole type chart (46:32 - 46:36)
at the beginning and you can pull it up (46:34 - 46:39)
in your menu at any time yeah like every (46:36 - 46:41)
other pokemon game is here's a trainer (46:39 - 46:43)
school and in the trainer school we're (46:41 - 46:45)
going to teach you about fire water and (46:43 - 46:47)
grass and you're like okay paper rock (46:45 - 46:49)
paper scissors this makes sense this (46:47 - 46:51)
game doesn't do that here's 18 000 (46:49 - 46:53)
different types and this is like no (46:51 - 46:56)
one's looking at this chart no one no (46:53 - 46:58)
when i say no one i mean no one who is (46:56 - 47:00)
this this is their first or maybe even (46:58 - 47:02)
second pokemon game wants to stare at (47:00 - 47:03)
that chart i've been playing the series (47:02 - 47:05)
for 25 years i don't want to stare at (47:03 - 47:06)
that chart (47:05 - 47:11)
like i just i just don't it it's (47:06 - 47:14)
yeah and i remember i remember playing (47:11 - 47:16)
i remember playing temtem for the first (47:14 - 47:17)
time two years ago when it was in beta (47:16 - 47:20)
or alpha temtem is like that you know (47:17 - 47:22)
wannabe pokemon it's it's a pokemon (47:20 - 47:26)
clone and they have i think 15 types in (47:22 - 47:27)
that game and they do the same thing in (47:26 - 47:28)
temtem when you start up the game (47:27 - 47:30)
they're like here's the type chart and (47:28 - 47:32)
you're like i don't know what oil type (47:30 - 47:35)
or technology type is but apparently (47:32 - 47:37)
they don't interact (47:35 - 47:39)
i guess maybe if i like this game i'll (47:37 - 47:40)
i'll eventually memorize it (47:39 - 47:42)
um (47:40 - 47:43)
and then (47:42 - 47:45)
they they do the thing of let's go (47:43 - 47:47)
pikachu let's be eevee which initially i (47:45 - 47:49)
thought this game was going to be (47:47 - 47:51)
no held items no abilities (47:49 - 47:52)
fine (47:51 - 47:54)
there's so many pokemon players who go (47:52 - 47:56)
through the game without ever equipping (47:54 - 47:59)
a held item totally acceptable there are (47:56 - 48:01)
so many pla like look i play i didn't i (47:59 - 48:03)
don't think i actually understood what (48:01 - 48:05)
mold breaker did until like gen six (48:03 - 48:07)
breaks the mold yeah it breaks the ball (48:05 - 48:09)
yeah it breaks the mold (48:07 - 48:12)
and i i would wager to bet anyone who's (48:09 - 48:14)
not super into competitive probably (48:12 - 48:16)
doesn't catch a pokemon with the intent (48:14 - 48:20)
of like this ability is good (48:16 - 48:20)
i want this dog pokemon on my team (48:21 - 48:27)
what like i most people probably don't (48:25 - 48:29)
even know what for free's ability so (48:27 - 48:33)
story storyline players yes (48:29 - 48:34)
i think (48:33 - 48:35)
i think (48:34 - 48:37)
certain ones they look for (48:35 - 48:39)
like i think every (48:37 - 48:41)
even casual players when they have a (48:39 - 48:43)
pickup one time (48:41 - 48:45)
well they're like i need a pokemon with (48:43 - 48:48)
pickup like there's just certain useful (48:45 - 48:49)
game abilities (48:48 - 48:50)
that (48:49 - 48:53)
they do care about but competitive (48:50 - 48:56)
specific or battle specific abilities (48:53 - 48:58)
i don't think i would agree that they (48:56 - 49:00)
really don't look for but over world (48:58 - 49:03)
useful things i do think people look for (49:00 - 49:04)
sure (49:03 - 49:05)
um like the only one i could really (49:04 - 49:07)
think of that somebody might stick with (49:05 - 49:09)
would be like mimikyu (49:07 - 49:12)
yeah because mimikyu's ability is very (49:09 - 49:13)
obvious (49:12 - 49:14)
um (49:13 - 49:17)
and like an ability too uh an ability (49:14 - 49:20)
like torrent (49:17 - 49:22)
of like a piplup or a uh (49:20 - 49:24)
for alligator or something (49:22 - 49:28)
i i would assume that like (49:24 - 49:28)
i would assume that people would be (49:28 - 49:31)
would just not know that hey if your (49:29 - 49:34)
health is below 30 your water type move (49:31 - 49:35)
is going to do more damage (49:34 - 49:36)
so (49:35 - 49:39)
again i my problem with the the the (49:36 - 49:40)
battle system isn't the lack of (49:39 - 49:42)
abilities and isn't the lack of held (49:40 - 49:44)
items i think that's fine to remove (49:42 - 49:47)
those to get people to ease into the (49:44 - 49:48)
game (49:47 - 49:50)
um and there's not even eevees in this (49:48 - 49:53)
game there's or sorry ivs there's just (49:50 - 49:55)
eevees yeah and they're doing the eevees (49:53 - 49:57)
kind of similar to let's go peach let's (49:55 - 49:58)
go eevee although maybe a little bit (49:57 - 50:00)
better where (49:58 - 50:01)
um (50:00 - 50:04)
every stat has a stat of 10 (50:01 - 50:07)
and you the alpha pokemon already have (50:04 - 50:09)
evs set (50:07 - 50:11)
that's why they're so much stronger (50:09 - 50:15)
and it when you catch like 50 ponyta and (50:11 - 50:17)
you release those 50 ponytail you get (50:15 - 50:19)
that grit i think it's called yeah you (50:17 - 50:21)
give that grit to increase it so if (50:19 - 50:23)
you're if you're playing through legends (50:21 - 50:26)
and you're like man the wild why is my (50:23 - 50:27)
level (50:26 - 50:28)
25 (50:27 - 50:30)
um (50:28 - 50:33)
wormple losing to a level (50:30 - 50:36)
five benary it's probably because you (50:33 - 50:38)
didn't give it any of that grit and some (50:36 - 50:40)
of those wild pokemon have that applied (50:38 - 50:42)
already (50:40 - 50:46)
and i think that is fine (50:42 - 50:48)
again not my specific problem with the (50:46 - 50:50)
game although they don't really make (50:48 - 50:52)
that super clear of like why you would (50:50 - 50:55)
want to do that yeah now you've educated (50:52 - 50:56)
me right now (50:55 - 50:58)
yeah they don't make it clear at all (50:56 - 50:59)
they really don't talk about it they say (50:58 - 51:02)
here's grit no they talk about the grant (50:59 - 51:04)
they talk about what it does but they (51:02 - 51:06)
don't say hey your pokemon's not going (51:04 - 51:07)
to be any good unless you give it some (51:06 - 51:10)
of the grit there's a whole thing about (51:07 - 51:12)
uh because leon interrupts you in this (51:10 - 51:14)
in the town and he's like there's stones (51:12 - 51:16)
all over and stones do different things (51:14 - 51:18)
and stones are important and here's some (51:16 - 51:20)
grit (51:18 - 51:20)
but also i i (51:23 - 51:27)
think that the (51:28 - 51:32)
problem (51:30 - 51:34)
is how they've (51:32 - 51:35)
i think the problem with the battle (51:34 - 51:38)
system is again not not the lack of (51:35 - 51:40)
abilities not the lack of held items not (51:38 - 51:41)
the lack of ivs not the fact that they (51:40 - 51:43)
simplified i actually think simplifying (51:41 - 51:45)
the evs is probably good as a (51:43 - 51:47)
competitive player i understand like hey (51:45 - 51:50)
incineroar needs like 68 (51:47 - 51:52)
in special defense and like 110 in speed (51:50 - 51:54)
but also the meta has changed so now (51:52 - 51:56)
we're going to bump down in center roar (51:54 - 51:58)
to 80. like i get it like i'm very into (51:56 - 52:00)
that scene right like i've (51:58 - 52:02)
i i (52:00 - 52:03)
hated competitive battling until i (52:02 - 52:06)
understood it and i get it (52:03 - 52:08)
i also understand that the (52:06 - 52:11)
wall to get into competitive battling is (52:08 - 52:12)
very high and i also understand that (52:11 - 52:15)
this game is not a competitive game i (52:12 - 52:16)
think the thing that drives me crazy (52:15 - 52:19)
with the battle system is (52:16 - 52:21)
for somebody who has (52:19 - 52:23)
fully understood the mechanics of (52:21 - 52:26)
pokemon (52:23 - 52:28)
this battle system is incredibly (52:26 - 52:30)
frustrating on what is doing what and (52:28 - 52:32)
why stuff is happening so like last week (52:30 - 52:33)
we talked about how you can't swords (52:32 - 52:36)
dance twice you can only sword stance (52:33 - 52:37)
once (52:36 - 52:40)
and there are no priority moves so a (52:37 - 52:43)
move like aquajet should be priority but (52:40 - 52:45)
it doesn't it's not priority but what (52:43 - 52:47)
happens when is when you use a move that (52:45 - 52:49)
is supposed to be priority it then gives (52:47 - 52:52)
you priority for the next turn which is (52:49 - 52:54)
nowhere explained (52:52 - 52:56)
and (52:54 - 52:58)
the the like you have to hit the y (52:56 - 53:01)
button to drop down this menu and the (52:58 - 53:04)
menu is showing who's going first (53:01 - 53:06)
for whatever reason so it'll be like (53:04 - 53:10)
weasel parasect weasel parasite weasel (53:06 - 53:12)
parasect (53:10 - 53:15)
and there are instances where (53:12 - 53:17)
the it'll be like okay i'm going first (53:15 - 53:19)
then they're going then i'm going and (53:17 - 53:21)
sometimes they'll just go twice (53:19 - 53:25)
well that's kind of explained is if it's (53:21 - 53:27)
if their speed is higher than yours they (53:25 - 53:29)
go first and if it's like (53:27 - 53:32)
significantly higher than yours they may (53:29 - 53:34)
get too attacked yeah they literally say (53:32 - 53:36)
that at the beginning (53:34 - 53:38)
but but you have no way in battle of (53:36 - 53:40)
figuring that out so you can't because (53:38 - 53:42)
it's the magic of being in a world where (53:40 - 53:44)
you don't have all the answers it's not (53:42 - 53:46)
spreadsheet wars (53:44 - 53:48)
it's living in a pokemon world i mean (53:46 - 53:50)
you can see if they have it because you (53:48 - 53:53)
can bring up the turn order true (53:50 - 53:55)
but i'm saying sometimes the turn order (53:53 - 53:58)
is like me you me you me you and they're (53:55 - 54:00)
not using agile style and they're (53:58 - 54:04)
sometimes taking two turns (54:00 - 54:04)
so it's like me me you (54:04 - 54:09)
but (54:06 - 54:09)
yes it's like it's like the aquajet (54:09 - 54:14)
thing right like nowhere does aquajet (54:11 - 54:16)
tell you that your next time is going to (54:14 - 54:17)
be boosted (54:16 - 54:19)
you just do it and then the next time (54:17 - 54:21)
you have a slight boost because you use (54:19 - 54:25)
that move i mean one thing i would like (54:21 - 54:26)
changed (54:25 - 54:28)
is i would like because what's happening (54:26 - 54:31)
and i know what you're talking about is (54:28 - 54:33)
when they do something that gives them (54:31 - 54:35)
an extra turn you can't look at the turn (54:33 - 54:38)
order again until it's your turn yes it (54:35 - 54:41)
is not visible yes so correct without it (54:38 - 54:44)
being there it makes it feel (54:41 - 54:46)
confusing about what just happened (54:44 - 54:49)
and since you passed that moment in the (54:46 - 54:51)
turn order you don't get to see it i (54:49 - 54:53)
would like to be able to see the turn (54:51 - 54:55)
order (54:53 - 54:55)
outside of my menu (54:56 - 55:00)
so that i can see what's happening to (54:58 - 55:02)
make more sense of what just happened in (55:00 - 55:04)
this battle they they don't do that so (55:02 - 55:07)
it does sometimes feel like what just (55:04 - 55:09)
happened why did they get two because (55:07 - 55:11)
when i looked at the turn order that (55:09 - 55:13)
wasn't going to happen (55:11 - 55:15)
there's also (55:13 - 55:17)
there's all i i purposely got in a fight (55:15 - 55:20)
with three zubats (55:17 - 55:23)
and you can you can hit the lr or (55:20 - 55:24)
whatever to pick which zubat and then if (55:23 - 55:27)
you look at the turn order it'll say you (55:24 - 55:29)
so i'll say weasel and it'll say zubat (55:27 - 55:32)
zubat zubat weasel (55:29 - 55:34)
which which zubat i don't know which one (55:32 - 55:37)
is going first (55:34 - 55:39)
like so you can be in a situation where (55:37 - 55:41)
it's you (55:39 - 55:42)
zubat (55:41 - 55:43)
you (55:42 - 55:45)
zubat zubat zubat and you're like well (55:43 - 55:47)
if i knock out the one zubat that's (55:45 - 55:48)
supposed to go next (55:47 - 55:49)
i (55:48 - 55:52)
get to go again so i was like i see the (55:49 - 55:54)
strategy i see what they're trying to do (55:52 - 55:56)
but when i'm selecting i don't know (55:54 - 55:58)
which of the three zubats is the one zoo (55:56 - 56:00)
bat that is supposed to go first so (55:58 - 56:02)
the only thing i have found in that is (56:00 - 56:05)
the one that you have highlighted like (56:02 - 56:07)
the one that you have targeted (56:05 - 56:08)
their (56:07 - 56:10)
panel turns red (56:08 - 56:11)
so you get the blue (56:10 - 56:13)
and then the one that you have targeted (56:11 - 56:17)
is red and then the other two are blank (56:13 - 56:19)
they'll be the the blank background and (56:17 - 56:21)
if you change the targeting (56:19 - 56:24)
you should be able to see (56:21 - 56:25)
oh (56:24 - 56:27)
i'm now targeting this one and then (56:25 - 56:30)
their line should turn red in the turn (56:27 - 56:33)
order it's not particularly intuitive (56:30 - 56:34)
[Music] (56:33 - 56:36)
but you should be able to switch the (56:34 - 56:38)
targets and see by which gets the red (56:36 - 56:42)
background which is in what order (56:38 - 56:44)
it's not great it's not great (56:42 - 56:46)
it's not great and i generally just am (56:44 - 56:48)
like whatever i don't care (56:46 - 56:52)
i don't think i don't think the agile (56:48 - 56:55)
strong style is also a problem (56:52 - 56:57)
when i when i first saw it i thought of (56:55 - 56:59)
bravely default and i'm gonna use a (56:57 - 57:01)
bravely default i'm gonna for those that (56:59 - 57:02)
haven't played bravely default i'm gonna (57:01 - 57:04)
explain that game a little bit because i (57:02 - 57:06)
think that this game (57:04 - 57:08)
if they just copied bravely default one (57:06 - 57:11)
to one it would have been incredible it (57:08 - 57:12)
seems like they copied somebody's (57:11 - 57:14)
homework but they like missed question (57:12 - 57:17)
one so then they like wrote like like (57:14 - 57:19)
they wrote the wrong answer for the next (57:17 - 57:20)
thing (57:19 - 57:21)
it's that thing where you can't copy it (57:20 - 57:23)
directly so you try to paraphrase it in (57:21 - 57:27)
your own way and make it worse so in in (57:23 - 57:30)
bravely default the game is called (57:27 - 57:32)
bravely default because you have two (57:30 - 57:35)
options you can brave or you can default (57:32 - 57:38)
during a battle if you decide to brave (57:35 - 57:40)
you can brave anywhere up to one to four (57:38 - 57:43)
times so what you can do is you can (57:40 - 57:45)
attack four times in a row which is (57:43 - 57:47)
brave brave rave and now you're (57:45 - 57:48)
attacking four times in a row but what (57:47 - 57:51)
that means is your opponent (57:48 - 57:53)
if they survive (57:51 - 57:55)
you have to wait now four turns because (57:53 - 57:57)
you you opted to use all your four turns (57:55 - 57:59)
up front and they get four turns sound (57:57 - 58:02)
familiar this is exactly like the brave (57:59 - 58:05)
and agile system so you can also default (58:02 - 58:07)
so if you choose to default you can (58:05 - 58:10)
default one to four times so you can say (58:07 - 58:13)
default default now you have you now you (58:10 - 58:15)
have reserved yourself two turns so if (58:13 - 58:17)
the next turn you want to brave one two (58:15 - 58:20)
three four times you're negative two (58:17 - 58:22)
plus four so now you're only losing two (58:20 - 58:24)
turns because you defaulted twice but (58:22 - 58:26)
then brave four (58:24 - 58:29)
um and when you do brave you're actually (58:26 - 58:31)
like in a defense mode so you can still (58:29 - 58:33)
take damage you just don't take as much (58:31 - 58:35)
because you're like default default (58:33 - 58:37)
pausing your turn um (58:35 - 58:40)
and it's really great and you why it's (58:37 - 58:44)
so great is because when you're grinding (58:40 - 58:47)
uh creatures in bravely default you go (58:44 - 58:49)
well there's only two creatures in front (58:47 - 58:52)
of me i'm going to brave bravery i'm (58:49 - 58:53)
gonna just brave (58:52 - 58:56)
and two hits knock that out two hits (58:53 - 58:59)
knock that out battle over (58:56 - 58:59)
but (58:59 - 59:02)
in a boss battle or maybe in this game (58:59 - 59:04)
an alpha battle you might not want to (59:02 - 59:07)
brave four times because that might not (59:04 - 59:10)
be enough to knock out like the alpha (59:07 - 59:11)
ursa ring (59:10 - 59:13)
and now you're giving alpha ursa ring (59:11 - 59:18)
four turns in a row to knock you out (59:13 - 59:18)
they could have just done that (59:18 - 59:23)
and they they didn't (59:20 - 59:25)
they didn't have to do like plus four (59:23 - 59:28)
minus four all that stuff but it's it's (59:25 - 59:31)
so close to that but not nearly as good (59:28 - 59:34)
and not nearly as fun i mean i i i do (59:31 - 59:36)
think there are hidden benefits to it (59:34 - 59:38)
they just don't (59:36 - 59:40)
they don't seem to (59:38 - 59:43)
matter enough to make the system that's (59:40 - 59:44)
pretty much what i was going to say it's (59:43 - 59:47)
to me it's very similar to held items (59:44 - 59:51)
and abilities i will probably never do (59:47 - 59:54)
an agile or a strong i'm just not (59:51 - 59:55)
putting that much effort (59:54 - 59:57)
into figuring out how that's gonna work (59:55 - 59:59)
but if you if you're if you're in a (59:57 - 60:01)
battle with um (59:59 - 60:02)
if you're in a battle with an earth ring (60:01 - 60:04)
right and you use a fighting type move (60:02 - 60:06)
and the move does ha (60:04 - 60:08)
like 40 percent (60:06 - 60:09)
you would (60:08 - 60:10)
you would know that the next turn if you (60:09 - 60:12)
just use the same move and then a (60:10 - 60:14)
supplied strong style with it it will (60:12 - 60:16)
probably finish it sure if i was (60:14 - 60:18)
overthinking things or actually planning (60:16 - 60:19)
through (60:18 - 60:21)
i just keep pressing buttons until (60:19 - 60:22)
something happens (60:21 - 60:24)
and then the other the other thing with (60:22 - 60:26)
the battle system and again i'm going to (60:24 - 60:28)
tie this back to bravely default because (60:26 - 60:30)
it just does it so much better (60:28 - 60:32)
is and i don't need pokemon to be (60:30 - 60:35)
bravely default but like (60:32 - 60:38)
you you introduce a system in this game (60:35 - 60:40)
where you're walking around in the world (60:38 - 60:43)
and you can get into a battle with like (60:40 - 60:45)
two psyduck (60:43 - 60:46)
and (60:45 - 60:47)
here i'll give you i'll give you a (60:46 - 60:49)
better example i was running to another (60:47 - 60:52)
area of the map and a shiny drift loon (60:49 - 60:55)
popped up out of nowhere awesome i went (60:52 - 60:56)
to go in (60:55 - 60:58)
interact with that shiny driftloon and (60:56 - 60:59)
while i started that battle with the (60:58 - 61:02)
shiny driftloon a star ravia decided to (60:59 - 61:05)
join and like a scruppy decided to join (61:02 - 61:07)
so the game puts you in a situation (61:05 - 61:08)
where it's (61:07 - 61:12)
one verse three and the battle system (61:08 - 61:14)
doesn't really give you anything to work (61:12 - 61:17)
with in that situation (61:14 - 61:18)
because i talked about that turn order (61:17 - 61:20)
before so (61:18 - 61:22)
what you can what you can do is you can (61:20 - 61:24)
just choose to ignore everything and (61:22 - 61:26)
keep throwing pokeballs at the driftloon (61:24 - 61:28)
or you can try to knock out the scooby (61:26 - 61:29)
and then the star rabia and then keep (61:28 - 61:31)
throwing pokeballs but there's nothing (61:29 - 61:34)
like (61:31 - 61:34)
surf or rock slide or or spread attacks (61:34 - 61:41)
they opted to get rid of all the spread (61:39 - 61:44)
attacks but they didn't opt to get rid (61:41 - 61:45)
of multiple battles i have no problem (61:44 - 61:47)
with multiple battles they're just not (61:45 - 61:49)
interesting in any way (61:47 - 61:51)
um and they've done multiple battles (61:49 - 61:53)
before in sun and moon (61:51 - 61:55)
all of the totem battles are two verse (61:53 - 61:56)
one well (61:55 - 62:00)
but we can blame this on the legions of (61:56 - 62:02)
people i won't name names but they (62:00 - 62:04)
probably live in scotland (62:02 - 62:07)
who complained of like well how come (62:04 - 62:10)
when i use earthquake it doesn't hit me (62:07 - 62:12)
if it's hitting everything else around (62:10 - 62:14)
here and now they're pokemon companies (62:12 - 62:16)
like oh well we can't do these spread (62:14 - 62:18)
moves because clearly the player is on (62:16 - 62:20)
the field so if they earthquake it's (62:18 - 62:22)
going to hurt the player himself oh (62:20 - 62:25)
that's something that happens (62:22 - 62:26)
that still happens (62:25 - 62:29)
and (62:26 - 62:29)
so so they got rid of spread moves for (62:29 - 62:34)
whatever reason but they incur they they (62:31 - 62:35)
have (62:34 - 62:37)
hey five pokemon can join this battle (62:35 - 62:40)
but they've done this before so like (62:37 - 62:41)
you have totem pokemon in sun and moon (62:40 - 62:44)
and ultra sun and moon where it's 1v2 (62:41 - 62:46)
and then in x and y and omega ruby you (62:44 - 62:48)
have five pokemon in front of you but (62:46 - 62:50)
they've also made the change that you (62:48 - 62:52)
can throw poke balls when there are (62:50 - 62:53)
multiple pokemon in front of you that's (62:52 - 62:56)
a good question (62:53 - 62:56)
i just wish if five people joined (62:56 - 63:01)
the party i should be able to throw out (63:00 - 63:04)
my other pokemon and be like let's let's (63:01 - 63:05)
do this (63:04 - 63:07)
my whole squad's here (63:05 - 63:09)
okay (63:07 - 63:10)
now i'm going to tie this back to (63:09 - 63:13)
bravely default so in bravely default if (63:10 - 63:15)
you're walking around the overworld and (63:13 - 63:16)
in bravely default you can see the (63:15 - 63:17)
creatures around the overworld because (63:16 - 63:20)
pokemon was one of the last jrpgs in the (63:17 - 63:21)
entire world to have creatures walking (63:20 - 63:23)
around the overworld (63:21 - 63:24)
um (63:23 - 63:27)
you can kite you can you can get (63:24 - 63:29)
creatures to follow you into other (63:27 - 63:31)
creatures so if i'm in bravely default (63:29 - 63:33)
and i see a scorpion (63:31 - 63:35)
it probably has a name because it's some (63:33 - 63:36)
monster i'll just cause and you the (63:35 - 63:38)
scorpion's not following you i'm gonna (63:36 - 63:40)
follow it i'm gonna walk this scorpion (63:38 - 63:42)
to another scorpion i'm gonna walk this (63:40 - 63:44)
scorpion to another scorpion and now (63:42 - 63:46)
instead of battling one scorpion i'm (63:44 - 63:47)
battling three scorpions and what (63:46 - 63:50)
bravely default does is you opted you (63:47 - 63:53)
made the choice to battle three instead (63:50 - 63:54)
of one we're gonna give you more (63:53 - 63:56)
experience we're gonna give you more (63:54 - 63:58)
rewards you've made it harder for (63:56 - 63:59)
yourself (63:58 - 64:01)
good luck and i think pokemon trainers (63:59 - 64:04)
want that they want a game where like if (64:01 - 64:06)
i make choices and i want to make it (64:04 - 64:09)
difficult i did that (64:06 - 64:11)
and in this game (64:09 - 64:14)
i can get three zubats to fight me i get (64:11 - 64:16)
zero benefit from those three zubat (64:14 - 64:18)
there's no reason (64:16 - 64:20)
there besides the i guess the challenge (64:18 - 64:21)
it's not challenging it's not (64:20 - 64:23)
challenging to fight them that's just (64:21 - 64:25)
annoying it's three zubats right the (64:23 - 64:27)
quack (64:25 - 64:29)
yeah i mean you get experience for the (64:27 - 64:32)
three but it's not the only real answer (64:29 - 64:34)
and what i do in these situations like (64:32 - 64:37)
let's say i roll up on a geo dude and a (64:34 - 64:40)
nosey zubat flies in and he's like i (64:37 - 64:41)
want in on this too i say get out of (64:40 - 64:45)
here nosy zubat (64:41 - 64:47)
and i mean that's as much as i do yeah (64:45 - 64:49)
the (64:47 - 64:49)
like i just i still don't understand why (64:51 - 64:56)
they got rid of like discharge or like (64:53 - 64:59)
surf like in in the sense (64:56 - 65:01)
you can stand behind the zubat and rock (64:59 - 65:03)
throw and you will get hit by the rock (65:01 - 65:05)
throw yeah so (65:03 - 65:07)
if (65:05 - 65:10)
i think it would be more interesting (65:07 - 65:12)
where your pokemon can only hold four (65:10 - 65:15)
moves so if you want to hold earthquake (65:12 - 65:18)
but you also want to hold (65:15 - 65:20)
a mud slap because mudslap they're both (65:18 - 65:21)
ground type moves mudslap hits one (65:20 - 65:23)
earthquake hits everything (65:21 - 65:24)
then (65:23 - 65:26)
then you're making more (65:24 - 65:28)
i don't even think it's complex but (65:26 - 65:30)
you're you're you're saying like i want (65:28 - 65:31)
these two moves because of these two (65:30 - 65:34)
situations and let let it have it have (65:31 - 65:36)
it where hey earthquake does hit (65:34 - 65:37)
everything it doesn't do as much damage (65:36 - 65:39)
as maybe single a single target move but (65:37 - 65:41)
also if you're using a move like (65:39 - 65:43)
earthquake or you're moving using a move (65:41 - 65:45)
like discharge your trainer has to (65:43 - 65:46)
actually stand farther back you have to (65:45 - 65:48)
move your trainer the trainer moving (65:46 - 65:50)
around in the world is like a very nice (65:48 - 65:52)
gimmick but that's all it is it's just a (65:50 - 65:54)
gimmick once you like move around after (65:52 - 65:57)
the first like five battles you're like (65:54 - 65:59)
makes me feel like i'm in the world (65:57 - 66:02)
it's a nice gimmick i enjoy it but (65:59 - 66:04)
again (66:02 - 66:06)
i think (66:04 - 66:10)
they stepped too far back (66:06 - 66:11)
from (66:10 - 66:14)
[Music] (66:11 - 66:14)
what the system could be out of safety (66:14 - 66:19)
and (66:17 - 66:22)
like we don't want to push this too far (66:19 - 66:23)
and i think (66:22 - 66:26)
for people who are very experienced with (66:23 - 66:30)
pokemon games we feel that that how far (66:26 - 66:33)
we are away from where we were (66:30 - 66:35)
very strongly yeah (66:33 - 66:37)
because it's gorgeous to be able to toss (66:35 - 66:39)
my pokemon out run off to the side and (66:37 - 66:41)
have them fight and that's so fluid but (66:39 - 66:43)
then i feel like (66:41 - 66:45)
the animations look right i want all my (66:43 - 66:47)
things i want to be able to hit these (66:45 - 66:49)
four pikachu with one move i want to be (66:47 - 66:50)
able to do (66:49 - 66:52)
all the things that i could do in my (66:50 - 66:54)
other games (66:52 - 66:57)
here and i'm stopped for not (66:54 - 66:59)
a great reason like it's not clear why (66:57 - 67:02)
they did it this way and so it feels (66:59 - 67:04)
like (67:02 - 67:05)
oh (67:04 - 67:07)
well i don't know i'd say that like for (67:05 - 67:09)
all of these types of things they (67:07 - 67:10)
probably had to do a valley an (67:09 - 67:15)
evaluation be of a spectrum of realism (67:10 - 67:18)
of i am in the world (67:15 - 67:20)
which we haven't had before because (67:18 - 67:21)
there's always been like there's this (67:20 - 67:24)
weird barrier between me and my pokemon (67:21 - 67:26)
versus (67:24 - 67:28)
how the moves work and operate based on (67:26 - 67:30)
tradition of how they move and operate (67:28 - 67:33)
and you know for you guys you feel like (67:30 - 67:35)
they went too (67:33 - 67:37)
far on the realism side (67:35 - 67:40)
rather than having to explain oh when (67:37 - 67:42)
your pokemon uses earthquake there's (67:40 - 67:44)
like a cone behind or something like (67:42 - 67:45)
that which they could have done but then (67:44 - 67:47)
once again that's that much more (67:45 - 67:49)
complexity (67:47 - 67:50)
for (67:49 - 67:52)
a new style of game that people have to (67:50 - 67:56)
learn yeah i i i do think (67:52 - 67:56)
experienced people (67:56 - 68:01)
find the battle system (67:58 - 68:03)
find find the parts that are missing (68:01 - 68:05)
from the battle system more readily (68:03 - 68:08)
i i do feel it when i'm like i want to (68:05 - 68:10)
be able to use discharge and it's just (68:08 - 68:11)
not available i don't want to have to (68:10 - 68:14)
fight all these zubats singly (68:11 - 68:16)
i don't have these options whereas a new (68:14 - 68:18)
player probably does not have that (68:16 - 68:20)
concern at all (68:18 - 68:23)
yeah i think though (68:20 - 68:25)
and some of the pushback is like well (68:23 - 68:27)
it's not a competitive game (68:25 - 68:30)
i get that but like (68:27 - 68:32)
sword and shield doesn't slam in your (68:30 - 68:34)
face that it's a competitive game right (68:32 - 68:36)
but sword and shield lowered the (68:34 - 68:38)
barriers to entry so much for (68:36 - 68:40)
competitive people that you have to (68:38 - 68:42)
start somewhere (68:40 - 68:43)
i (68:42 - 68:46)
as a pokemon fan (68:43 - 68:48)
always came to pokemon from like red and (68:46 - 68:49)
blue (68:48 - 68:50)
gold and silver (68:49 - 68:53)
diamond and pearl like the battling is (68:50 - 68:55)
what brought me to pokemon (68:53 - 68:58)
and i didn't switch that and then black (68:55 - 68:59)
and white is like i want to try to take (68:58 - 69:01)
this seriously i just don't understand (68:59 - 69:03)
it enough and people helped me build (69:01 - 69:04)
teams and i went that's where will and i (69:03 - 69:06)
met we met at like a tournament (69:04 - 69:08)
um and then that the competitive (69:06 - 69:11)
battling in the video game got me into (69:08 - 69:14)
competitive battling in the tcg (69:11 - 69:16)
and then in x and y i (69:14 - 69:19)
slowly stopped caring about the battling (69:16 - 69:21)
because it was kind of so much the same (69:19 - 69:23)
and i then got more into (69:21 - 69:26)
like the catching and then sun and moon (69:23 - 69:28)
was like i want to complete my pokedex (69:26 - 69:30)
so i definitely like changed as a (69:28 - 69:32)
trainer where like the the battle system (69:30 - 69:34)
in the original pokemon games me being (69:32 - 69:36)
like a 10 year old the 12 year old (69:34 - 69:38)
seeing ash battle like i wanted to but i (69:36 - 69:40)
wanted to be like the world's greatest (69:38 - 69:42)
trainer right and then very quickly (69:40 - 69:43)
realized (69:42 - 69:44)
there's (69:43 - 69:46)
way many people out there that are (69:44 - 69:48)
better than battling than i am (69:46 - 69:49)
and now as a trainer i like the (69:48 - 69:52)
collection aspect and then because sword (69:49 - 69:54)
and shield was so good with the battling (69:52 - 69:56)
i got back into battling to a point (69:54 - 69:58)
where like i understand evs i understand (69:56 - 70:00)
ivs i understand turn order i understand (69:58 - 70:02)
how to like build a team to like have (70:00 - 70:04)
synergy with each other (70:02 - 70:07)
and so it's hard for me to be like well (70:04 - 70:09)
legends is the best pokemon game ever i (70:07 - 70:10)
don't think it is i think it's an (70:09 - 70:12)
incredibly good pokemon game i think (70:10 - 70:13)
it's incredibly fun i think it's worth (70:12 - 70:14)
the 60 (70:13 - 70:16)
even with the battle system being bad i (70:14 - 70:18)
still think a hundred percent every (70:16 - 70:20)
pokemon fan should go out and buy this (70:18 - 70:22)
game except (70:20 - 70:25)
if you the main reason you like pokemon (70:22 - 70:27)
games is battling and that's that's why (70:25 - 70:29)
i'm being so hard in the battle sense (70:27 - 70:30)
because i cannot say this is the best (70:29 - 70:32)
pokemon game ever because if your (70:30 - 70:34)
favorite part of pokemon is battling (70:32 - 70:37)
this game does not do it (70:34 - 70:41)
it just doesn't i hope that (70:37 - 70:41)
they keep this sort of fluid into battle (70:41 - 70:49)
in the over world going forward but with (70:45 - 70:51)
the battle advancements that we're used (70:49 - 70:53)
to in (70:51 - 70:56)
like sword and shield (70:53 - 70:56)
like i want to be able to move in and (70:56 - 71:00)
out of battles as freely in future games (70:58 - 71:03)
as i can in arceus but i want (71:00 - 71:06)
more of the (71:03 - 71:08)
the spread moves and the things that i'm (71:06 - 71:10)
used to in battling in future games i (71:08 - 71:13)
kind of want like i really like the fact (71:10 - 71:14)
that it's so smooth to jump into battle (71:13 - 71:17)
i just toss it and it's poof it's like (71:14 - 71:19)
what would happen in the real world and (71:17 - 71:21)
i it feels great (71:19 - 71:24)
i just want my (71:21 - 71:28)
rich pool of moves back so like for for (71:24 - 71:31)
pokemon legends victini they can just (71:28 - 71:32)
like make it (71:31 - 71:34)
slightly more complex because it's like (71:32 - 71:36)
all right everybody learned arceus the (71:34 - 71:38)
basics now we're going to just dial up (71:36 - 71:41)
the complexity a little bit more (71:38 - 71:44)
i and i think it's i think it's close (71:41 - 71:45)
the ease of getting into battle the ease (71:44 - 71:47)
of leaving battle (71:45 - 71:49)
the the the weirdness of like taking a (71:47 - 71:52)
move like surf i don't even know if surf (71:49 - 71:55)
is in the game um but like only single (71:52 - 71:56)
like (71:55 - 71:58)
again they if they did the bravely (71:56 - 72:00)
default thing of hey you can choose to (71:58 - 72:03)
battle one geodude at a time but if you (72:00 - 72:05)
want to get three geodudes in here we're (72:03 - 72:06)
gonna give you more experience more (72:05 - 72:08)
rewards we're going to make it harder (72:06 - 72:10)
for you you got to think about the move (72:08 - 72:11)
choices a little bit better maybe you'll (72:10 - 72:13)
bring different pokemon (72:11 - 72:16)
um like they're really close (72:13 - 72:19)
to what other jrpgs are doing persona 5 (72:16 - 72:21)
is another great example (72:19 - 72:23)
like (72:21 - 72:25)
there is a balance (72:23 - 72:27)
between (72:25 - 72:29)
battling (72:27 - 72:31)
six zubats (72:29 - 72:34)
and battling an alpha and battling a (72:31 - 72:36)
boss and i wouldn't really consider (72:34 - 72:38)
alpha's bosses but (72:36 - 72:40)
again i think of games like persona 5 i (72:38 - 72:41)
think in games like bravely default (72:40 - 72:44)
where there are strong creatures (72:41 - 72:46)
in the overworld that are not bosses (72:44 - 72:49)
and you do need a good like i sh like (72:46 - 72:51)
there is nothing interesting (72:49 - 72:53)
and this is this is this goes back to (72:51 - 72:54)
why i think let's go pikachu let's go (72:53 - 72:56)
eevee is a great game (72:54 - 72:57)
they added more trainers and let's go (72:56 - 72:59)
eevee let's go pikachu (72:57 - 73:02)
versus pokemon yellow right so you go (72:59 - 73:04)
into viridian forest (73:02 - 73:05)
there's a bunch of trainers you go your (73:04 - 73:06)
way to celadon there's a bunch of (73:05 - 73:07)
trainers there's more trainers than (73:06 - 73:09)
there were in the past game but you're (73:07 - 73:11)
not battling pikachus you're not (73:09 - 73:12)
battling weedles you're not battling (73:11 - 73:14)
caterpies you're just catching them and (73:12 - 73:15)
i think let's go pikachu let's go eevee (73:14 - 73:17)
has a great balance of like hey if you (73:15 - 73:18)
want a trainer battle it's there if you (73:17 - 73:20)
want a wild pokemon battle it's there (73:18 - 73:22)
and i get i do get pushback of like i (73:20 - 73:24)
miss battling wild pokemon (73:22 - 73:26)
why (73:24 - 73:27)
what do you miss about it do you miss (73:26 - 73:30)
one-shotting pikachus over and over and (73:27 - 73:31)
over again because i get to battle (73:30 - 73:33)
pokemon what's (73:31 - 73:36)
because like (73:33 - 73:38)
i don't think inherently there is (73:36 - 73:40)
interest anything interesting about (73:38 - 73:42)
battling wild pokemon if i want to (73:40 - 73:44)
battle i want to battle a trainer who (73:42 - 73:46)
normally has two or three pokemon who (73:44 - 73:48)
normally has a strategy (73:46 - 73:50)
even on early routes (73:48 - 73:53)
like a really good example of this is in (73:50 - 73:55)
sun and moon when you make it right (73:53 - 73:57)
outside the first trial of sun and moon (73:55 - 73:59)
there's like a really rich trainer and i (73:57 - 74:01)
can't remember what she's using she (73:59 - 74:03)
might be using like a mill tank or (74:01 - 74:05)
something pretty basic (74:03 - 74:08)
it doesn't matter what she's using but (74:05 - 74:10)
most people cannot one shot her (74:08 - 74:12)
and so you get her down to like one hp (74:10 - 74:15)
and then she just uses a max potion (74:12 - 74:16)
and then you're like what and then you (74:15 - 74:18)
like get her down to one hp again and (74:16 - 74:20)
she uses a max potion and this girl has (74:18 - 74:22)
like unlimited max potions because her (74:20 - 74:24)
like username is like (74:22 - 74:25)
rich (74:24 - 74:28)
beauty524 like like all of the trainers (74:25 - 74:31)
in most pokemon games have a strategy (74:28 - 74:33)
the the difference is (74:31 - 74:35)
you probably knock them out before they (74:33 - 74:37)
even use the strategy and it's the same (74:35 - 74:39)
for gym leaders too like they all have a (74:37 - 74:43)
strategy like if you let (74:39 - 74:44)
uh what's that dude's name not iris the (74:43 - 74:46)
eighth gym leader in black and white the (74:44 - 74:48)
dreiden (74:46 - 74:50)
dryden well it's either drayton or (74:48 - 74:52)
driving on your version yeah (74:50 - 74:54)
like if you (74:52 - 74:55)
let (74:54 - 74:57)
him set up (74:55 - 74:59)
oh he's he's setting up and he's (74:57 - 75:01)
probably going to beat you like he has a (74:59 - 75:03)
specific strategy and if you don't stop (75:01 - 75:04)
it (75:03 - 75:06)
you will be stopped by him hey if you (75:04 - 75:09)
don't stop it he will stop you um (75:06 - 75:12)
but but wild pokemon don't have that (75:09 - 75:15)
strategy right like and i think that's (75:12 - 75:18)
why the alpha pokemons stand out to me (75:15 - 75:20)
as like fun (75:18 - 75:22)
why non-trainer battles is because they (75:20 - 75:24)
are super strong and before you (75:22 - 75:27)
encounter them you have to think like (75:24 - 75:29)
okay do i want to knock this out do i (75:27 - 75:31)
want to catch it they're like they're (75:29 - 75:32)
like i remember the first time i (75:31 - 75:36)
attacked that parasect i was level 25 (75:32 - 75:37)
um (75:36 - 75:38)
was my strongest pokemon and my other (75:37 - 75:41)
pokemon were like 22 23 and the parasite (75:38 - 75:44)
was 40. 15 levels above and i was like (75:41 - 75:46)
i'm gonna go in i'm gonna hope that i (75:44 - 75:47)
hit it with a thunder wave it's gonna (75:46 - 75:49)
one i know it's going to one shot me i (75:47 - 75:51)
am gonna send out another pokemon i'm (75:49 - 75:53)
going to hope i hit it with hypnosis and (75:51 - 75:55)
now i know in like three or four turns (75:53 - 75:57)
that status condition is going to clear (75:55 - 75:58)
because that's how status conditions (75:57 - 76:01)
work in this game so i'm on a time limit (75:58 - 76:03)
to catch this but i'm also on a time (76:01 - 76:05)
limit that it's going to one shot (76:03 - 76:08)
everything so like (76:05 - 76:09)
that is great and that's what these (76:08 - 76:12)
other jrpgs have been doing for years (76:09 - 76:15)
like person five bravely default etc (76:12 - 76:18)
the other battles (76:15 - 76:19)
again in persona five and bravely (76:18 - 76:22)
default yeah they exist but they exist (76:19 - 76:24)
in like a millisecond because you're (76:22 - 76:26)
you're just knocking them out right away (76:24 - 76:28)
and you're moving on (76:26 - 76:30)
and they have the speed up features and (76:28 - 76:32)
they have like the bravery feature (76:30 - 76:34)
where it's like these battles are so (76:32 - 76:35)
useless (76:34 - 76:37)
and they're they're just filler and (76:35 - 76:38)
they're just for you to experience and (76:37 - 76:41)
pokemon has an alternative to that now (76:38 - 76:43)
and that alternative was in let's go (76:41 - 76:45)
pikachu let's go eevee it's just called (76:43 - 76:47)
catching them and moving on we don't (76:45 - 76:49)
need to battle (76:47 - 76:51)
800 pikachus we already know that we're (76:49 - 76:52)
just gonna bulldoze it over and over (76:51 - 76:54)
again so instead of going through the (76:52 - 76:55)
okay we started the battle i gotta (76:54 - 76:58)
select bulldoze we i gotta watch you (76:55 - 77:01)
faint i gotta move on let me just catch (76:58 - 77:03)
like i don't need to battle (77:01 - 77:06)
garbage wild pokemon (77:03 - 77:08)
i don't but i would like to battle (77:06 - 77:09)
alphas and i would like to battle (77:08 - 77:12)
trainers you can just catch (77:09 - 77:13)
the right (77:12 - 77:15)
that's what i'm saying you don't have to (77:13 - 77:16)
battle them (77:15 - 77:18)
um (77:16 - 77:20)
i enjoy the battles i like seeing (77:18 - 77:21)
animations (77:20 - 77:24)
there are (77:21 - 77:24)
valid reasons for people who like (77:25 - 77:30)
battling wild pokemon for them liking (77:27 - 77:33)
liking it and like it doesn't hurt me to (77:30 - 77:34)
have them there (77:33 - 77:38)
uh so like i could be over it like (77:34 - 77:41)
i'm over grinding on mobs in most games (77:38 - 77:43)
but a lot of people (77:41 - 77:46)
enjoy seeing (77:43 - 77:46)
like that gives them a sense of wonder (77:46 - 77:50)
of the world you run into these things (77:48 - 77:53)
they they attack they have certain moves (77:50 - 77:54)
that are standard that's like kind of (77:53 - 77:55)
gives you (77:54 - 77:58)
interest about about what they are like (77:55 - 78:00)
there are reasons to do it and whether (77:58 - 78:02)
or not you find them compelling or not (78:00 - 78:04)
is entirely on you (78:02 - 78:05)
um (78:04 - 78:08)
i think what i'm saying is i (78:05 - 78:10)
if you're if you're reasoning because (78:08 - 78:12)
you want to battle wild pokemon is (78:10 - 78:15)
because you like to battle (78:12 - 78:15)
then the solution the game should give (78:15 - 78:20)
you is battles that mean something and (78:17 - 78:23)
that's usually normally a trainer battle (78:20 - 78:23)
versus (78:23 - 78:28)
just a random battle in viridian forest (78:23 - 78:28)
i mean that's why you like that's why (78:28 - 78:32)
i'm saying let's go pikachu let's go (78:31 - 78:34)
evie did that go well (78:32 - 78:35)
because they increased the amount of (78:34 - 78:37)
trainers because they knew that there (78:35 - 78:39)
were not any wild battles (78:37 - 78:41)
but there are also people who found the (78:39 - 78:43)
game lacking because there weren't wild (78:41 - 78:46)
pokemon battles (78:43 - 78:48)
and i just think those people are wrong (78:46 - 78:49)
like yeah i mean you can think that (78:48 - 78:50)
they're wrong because it doesn't appeal (78:49 - 78:52)
to you but it appeals to them there is (78:50 - 78:54)
something about that interaction that (78:52 - 78:56)
they enjoy there is something about the (78:54 - 78:58)
interaction of people doing huns in (78:56 - 79:02)
final fantasy 14 that is completely lost (78:58 - 79:04)
on me i don't know why you want to do (79:02 - 79:06)
those i don't know why people do them (79:04 - 79:10)
but they're there and they do it (79:06 - 79:10)
it's not for me to say (79:12 - 79:17)
hey this is dumb you should remove it (79:15 - 79:19)
from the game because clearly there's a (79:17 - 79:22)
lot of people that like it (79:19 - 79:24)
i just think that (79:22 - 79:27)
pokemon in particular could be better at (79:24 - 79:29)
ways to avoid those other than you have (79:27 - 79:32)
to spend money on super repels (79:29 - 79:33)
and one of the ways of doing that is (79:32 - 79:35)
having things in the (79:33 - 79:37)
overworld that you can dodge (79:35 - 79:38)
yeah (79:37 - 79:40)
and if you there's three of them (79:38 - 79:42)
you should be able to hit all three or (79:40 - 79:44)
be rewarded for whatever yes (79:42 - 79:47)
yes like i said i i don't think the (79:44 - 79:48)
battle system (79:47 - 79:50)
the battle system doesn't deter detour (79:48 - 79:51)
deter (79:50 - 79:53)
push away (79:51 - 79:56)
d2 or the game (79:53 - 79:58)
something's getting detoured it doesn't (79:56 - 80:01)
take away from the enjoyment of the game (79:58 - 80:04)
it takes okay it lowers the score like i (80:01 - 80:06)
give the game a solid b plus (80:04 - 80:09)
like it's not an a plus game because of (80:06 - 80:11)
these things that i find missing (80:09 - 80:16)
but it is a it is a b plus (80:11 - 80:18)
experience for me and that is a rare (80:16 - 80:20)
game these days (80:18 - 80:23)
yeah i think i i do think (80:20 - 80:24)
the (80:23 - 80:26)
core things that make a pokemon game a (80:24 - 80:27)
pokemon game really come down to (80:26 - 80:30)
catching and collecting pokemon and (80:27 - 80:33)
battling pokemon (80:30 - 80:35)
like i don't think eight gyms need makes (80:33 - 80:37)
a pokemon game i don't think (80:35 - 80:39)
as much as i like ribbons and marks i (80:37 - 80:40)
don't think ribbons and marks make a (80:39 - 80:42)
pokemon game as much as i (80:40 - 80:44)
as as much as some people like breeding (80:42 - 80:46)
i don't think breeding (80:44 - 80:48)
needs to be in a pokemon game although i (80:46 - 80:51)
do would i would i need to say that it (80:48 - 80:52)
is it is a very important part (80:51 - 80:56)
in this game i want it so bad (80:52 - 80:58)
um i don't think abilities and held (80:56 - 81:01)
items need to be in a pokemon game i (80:58 - 81:03)
don't need i don't think growing berries (81:01 - 81:05)
need to be in a pokemon game (81:03 - 81:06)
but i do think that catching and (81:05 - 81:08)
collecting needs to be in a pokemon game (81:06 - 81:10)
and i do think battling needs to be in a (81:08 - 81:12)
pokemon game and the battling in this (81:10 - 81:14)
game is very weak (81:12 - 81:16)
yeah (81:14 - 81:18)
i agree that it is a it is a weaker (81:16 - 81:20)
point of the game (81:18 - 81:20)
very intro level (81:22 - 81:25)
but the second area is the best area (81:25 - 81:29)
because it has badu in it so (81:27 - 81:31)
nothing more no (81:29 - 81:33)
wrong because (81:31 - 81:35)
one thing (81:33 - 81:37)
that you said on sunday (81:35 - 81:39)
which you shouldn't have because it was (81:37 - 81:41)
talking about the second area when we (81:39 - 81:43)
were supposed to only be talking about (81:41 - 81:45)
up to cleavoir was (81:43 - 81:47)
they've put me in this area with all of (81:45 - 81:50)
these high ridges that i can't get (81:47 - 81:51)
around i can't (81:50 - 81:54)
dag nabbit i hate that (81:51 - 81:59)
i cannot get anywhere in that area and (81:54 - 82:03)
i'm just like oh yes i'm so tired of it (81:59 - 82:06)
and it's very very brown and i just it (82:03 - 82:08)
is very care about the brown i don't (82:06 - 82:09)
care it's just like it's just so (82:08 - 82:11)
annoying that they they (82:09 - 82:13)
can't i played enough in this game to (82:11 - 82:16)
know how weird dear glitches through (82:13 - 82:17)
clips at this point (82:16 - 82:19)
like if i hit the cliff at this angle at (82:17 - 82:22)
this speed he will go up i don't know if (82:19 - 82:24)
that's a glitch because one of the first (82:22 - 82:26)
errors that air quote errors i saw in (82:24 - 82:28)
the game was a stantler standing in (82:26 - 82:30)
midair because it had decided to jump (82:28 - 82:33)
away from me but then turn around i see (82:30 - 82:35)
that too well it's the it is the looney (82:33 - 82:37)
tunes (82:35 - 82:39)
philosophy of gravity (82:37 - 82:42)
standards and weird ears have anti-grav (82:39 - 82:44)
powers that's all it is well they have (82:42 - 82:46)
psychic abilities so (82:44 - 82:47)
um (82:46 - 82:49)
this is probably getting a little ahead (82:47 - 82:53)
but i think the so the pokedex is 240. (82:49 - 82:54)
this is probably the last point i will (82:53 - 82:56)
say the pokedex is 240. (82:54 - 82:59)
when i got to the second area i was so (82:56 - 83:00)
excited and there are new pokemon in the (82:59 - 83:02)
second area (83:00 - 83:03)
um there's like that's for the first (83:02 - 83:06)
time you see badou and roselia well (83:03 - 83:08)
that's poison lots of poison (83:06 - 83:11)
and i think somebody at game freak (83:08 - 83:13)
they that we they've been working on the (83:11 - 83:15)
games for a long time bless their souls (83:13 - 83:16)
hopefully they get a great retirement (83:15 - 83:20)
plan but whoever is obsessed with zubat (83:16 - 83:25)
and geodude please retire them (83:20 - 83:25)
there is no need for crooked tots all (83:25 - 83:29)
over the place but i think a new (83:27 - 83:31)
contender has happened (83:29 - 83:33)
they were like you know what (83:31 - 83:35)
paris needs the spotlight (83:33 - 83:38)
we like that (83:35 - 83:40)
he's on every map (83:38 - 83:43)
and he's very aggressive and there is (83:40 - 83:46)
too much paris in this game (83:43 - 83:48)
and i just can't i can't handle it it's (83:46 - 83:50)
the new g dude (83:48 - 83:51)
like look look (83:50 - 83:53)
somebody who's working at the pokemon (83:51 - 83:55)
company or game freak we know you listen (83:53 - 83:56)
the show (83:55 - 83:59)
if you're going to keep giving us zubats (83:56 - 84:02)
and geodudes and paris's at least give (83:59 - 84:05)
us gallerian forms of them at least let (84:02 - 84:06)
us like yeah (84:05 - 84:08)
in forms gallery let us look at (84:06 - 84:10)
something new well we did get (84:08 - 84:13)
a lowland geodude well put him on the (84:10 - 84:15)
island yeah like get rid of the old give (84:13 - 84:17)
us the the lowlands you do he's give us (84:15 - 84:19)
something different here (84:17 - 84:20)
um (84:19 - 84:23)
ending point here is (84:20 - 84:26)
the the first area is so (84:23 - 84:30)
great and so rich and such an amazing (84:26 - 84:32)
experience and the second area (84:30 - 84:34)
a little muddy a little brown you start (84:32 - 84:36)
a little (84:34 - 84:38)
paris everywhere (84:36 - 84:40)
the third area (84:38 - 84:42)
a little bit better in pokemon choices (84:40 - 84:45)
the fourth area we ran out of pokemon (84:42 - 84:47)
because uh (84:45 - 84:49)
we're giving you the same ones again (84:47 - 84:51)
and i think that's where like (84:49 - 84:54)
that's where a bigger dex would have (84:51 - 84:55)
fixed this (84:54 - 84:58)
i disagree with that about the fourth (84:55 - 84:59)
area (84:58 - 85:02)
the fourth area is schink's galore (84:59 - 85:05)
and i've been seeing shanks for (85:02 - 85:06)
three areas do you want to talk about (85:05 - 85:08)
why i disagree with that because it's a (85:06 - 85:11)
big spoiler for that area oh (85:08 - 85:12)
there is a lot of things though when you (85:11 - 85:14)
walk into the area there is a lot of (85:12 - 85:17)
shanks when you start but i (85:14 - 85:21)
i the what the fourth area does is (85:17 - 85:24)
is interesting and i don't i i don't (85:21 - 85:25)
want to spoil (85:24 - 85:27)
why i think it's i think it's a better (85:25 - 85:29)
design than you're giving it credit but (85:27 - 85:31)
if the pokedex was bigger we would not (85:29 - 85:33)
have the pokedex was bigger we would (85:31 - 85:35)
still have bdoofs everywhere so that's (85:33 - 85:37)
true let's try not wait they are good at (85:35 - 85:40)
the mind of the game yeah yes (85:37 - 85:41)
it's like slightly weird like murkrow (85:40 - 85:43)
comes out at night on the second area (85:41 - 85:45)
and like not really anywhere else and (85:43 - 85:46)
it's like why do you keep giving me like (85:45 - 85:48)
there's other night pokemon (85:46 - 85:50)
like why is it not paris during the day (85:48 - 85:52)
spin a rack at night or something it's i (85:50 - 85:54)
don't know it's (85:52 - 85:55)
there's some they're slightly weird (85:54 - 85:58)
choices a bigger pokedex (85:55 - 86:01)
would have helped some yes i don't i (85:58 - 86:03)
don't think knowing that (86:01 - 86:04)
when we had what (86:03 - 86:07)
how many did we have in (86:04 - 86:10)
sun and moon potentially 320 i think for (86:07 - 86:13)
the first pokedex 400 for ultra (86:10 - 86:16)
you still had giant swaths of zubats and (86:13 - 86:18)
yeah so like you don't have to ride (86:16 - 86:19)
behind me (86:18 - 86:23)
you still have a like a bigger pokedex (86:19 - 86:25)
does not alter the fact that they really (86:23 - 86:26)
like (86:25 - 86:28)
not having great bio tentacles and (86:26 - 86:31)
tentacruels i think a bigger pokedex in (86:28 - 86:33)
the sense of (86:31 - 86:35)
this game breaks it this game breaks (86:33 - 86:37)
down into five areas (86:35 - 86:39)
and there are no routes there are no (86:37 - 86:40)
cities (86:39 - 86:42)
and sure there can be some overlap (86:40 - 86:43)
obviously there's only so much you can (86:42 - 86:45)
do with water so much you can do at (86:43 - 86:48)
night so much you can do with caves (86:45 - 86:51)
but if instead of having (86:48 - 86:52)
gosh how many routes are in brilliant (86:51 - 86:55)
diamond shining pearl like 100 (86:52 - 86:58)
[Laughter] (86:55 - 87:00)
uh (86:58 - 87:03)
but having each (87:00 - 87:06)
area with a more unique selection of (87:03 - 87:08)
pokemon so by the time you get to the (87:06 - 87:11)
fourth or fifth area or just like (87:08 - 87:13)
because because you are at least for me (87:11 - 87:15)
i'm like excited to go to a new area (87:13 - 87:17)
because i'm excited to see new pokemon (87:15 - 87:18)
and when you first walk into area four (87:17 - 87:22)
and all you're seeing are sinks and um (87:18 - 87:23)
mothers (87:22 - 87:24)
you're like well this isn't exciting (87:23 - 87:26)
yeah and yes area four has some great (87:24 - 87:29)
pokemon in the back but (87:26 - 87:31)
it opens weak i will agree with that (87:29 - 87:34)
also don't do what i did (87:31 - 87:36)
which is ignore (87:34 - 87:39)
the mission to set up the second camp (87:36 - 87:41)
in the swamp area (87:39 - 87:43)
no i did that immediately (87:41 - 87:45)
i forgot i didn't even i didn't even (87:43 - 87:47)
notice it on the map (87:45 - 87:50)
and it wasn't until today that i'm like (87:47 - 87:52)
that is such an easy mission too because (87:50 - 87:54)
it's like throw a pokeball throw a (87:52 - 87:57)
pokeball throw a pokeball done (87:54 - 87:58)
yeah i (87:57 - 88:00)
didn't even see it on the map (87:58 - 88:02)
it wasn't until today that i got the (88:00 - 88:05)
second camp in the swamp area (88:02 - 88:07)
because i i just spaced it (88:05 - 88:08)
um (88:07 - 88:10)
i think we should wrap up here another (88:08 - 88:12)
just a great part (88:10 - 88:13)
another great part here mass release (88:12 - 88:16)
that's a thing i'm not 100 sure how to (88:13 - 88:19)
unlock it uh i know the box system (88:16 - 88:22)
as long as the boxes keep filling um (88:19 - 88:23)
more boxes will start opening that's (88:22 - 88:25)
just like in other pokemon games the (88:23 - 88:27)
game will actually straight up tell you (88:25 - 88:29)
if your boxes are full (88:27 - 88:31)
i believe it's 29 boxes (88:29 - 88:33)
30 pokemon per box i believe that's 890 (88:31 - 88:36)
pokemon um i filled my boxes very (88:33 - 88:38)
quickly because i catch a lot (88:36 - 88:40)
the game will (88:38 - 88:42)
not let you catch anymore and then in (88:40 - 88:44)
the bottom corner i think it's the right (88:42 - 88:46)
hand corner it will say your your (88:44 - 88:48)
pasture is full and it will keep linking (88:46 - 88:50)
that at you yeah um so that's a great (88:48 - 88:53)
feature (88:50 - 88:55)
there is no way to search for alphas or (88:53 - 88:58)
shinies so i would highly recommend (88:55 - 89:01)
people to mark use the marks (88:58 - 89:03)
in a way like there are no ivs in this (89:01 - 89:04)
game i know some people are still on (89:03 - 89:07)
boomer mode for using mark the marking (89:04 - 89:09)
system for ivs there are no ivs in this (89:07 - 89:12)
game mark your shinies as like stars (89:09 - 89:14)
and that way you can just search by star (89:12 - 89:15)
find all your shinies and put them in a (89:14 - 89:18)
box you can also (89:15 - 89:20)
i just mark my alphas as the red circle (89:18 - 89:22)
because i'm the red eyes so you can find (89:20 - 89:23)
all your alphas very quickly so you (89:22 - 89:26)
don't accidentally release them they did (89:23 - 89:28)
do two great things as well one the (89:26 - 89:30)
shininess appears in the name of the (89:28 - 89:31)
pokemon that's incredible for (89:30 - 89:34)
accessibility pokemon games and i think (89:31 - 89:36)
just nintendo games in general are so (89:34 - 89:38)
bad at accessibility so this is a great (89:36 - 89:41)
step for people who are colorblind um or (89:38 - 89:43)
people who maybe can't hear the sparkles (89:41 - 89:45)
or whatnot (89:43 - 89:46)
uh so that's in the name the other thing (89:45 - 89:49)
is when you try to release a shiny in a (89:46 - 89:51)
box it will tell you that it's a special (89:49 - 89:54)
pokemon so an another great thing to do (89:51 - 89:56)
um (89:54 - 89:58)
i can't gosh i i don't mean to do this (89:56 - 90:00)
but because we brought up boxes they do (89:58 - 90:02)
the they do the the (90:00 - 90:04)
when you catch a new pokemon it goes to (90:02 - 90:06)
the front of the box (90:04 - 90:08)
yeah i hate it and it's the they did (90:06 - 90:10)
this in diamond and pearl it's the worst (90:08 - 90:13)
in sword and shield or most pokemon (90:10 - 90:14)
games the past i think almost all the (90:13 - 90:15)
pokemon games until we got to diamond (90:14 - 90:16)
and pearl (90:15 - 90:18)
when you caught a pokemon it would go (90:16 - 90:20)
into the box that was selected so if i'm (90:18 - 90:22)
on box 20 and i start catching those (90:20 - 90:24)
pokemon go into box 20 and then they (90:22 - 90:27)
fill from 20 to 21 to 22. in this game (90:24 - 90:30)
if i have a single spot in box 3 and (90:27 - 90:33)
then box 4 5 and 6 are all filled (90:30 - 90:34)
whatever i catch will go into that (90:33 - 90:37)
single spot and it makes it impossible (90:34 - 90:38)
to find stuff if you're not using the (90:37 - 90:40)
search feature (90:38 - 90:41)
at all so (90:40 - 90:44)
i don't know why this is a thing i don't (90:41 - 90:46)
know why they decided to change this it (90:44 - 90:48)
is awful because if you're trying to (90:46 - 90:49)
build a living dex don't do it in the (90:48 - 90:51)
first like five boxes because they're (90:49 - 90:52)
just gonna fill in the blanks you have (90:51 - 90:54)
to like move it to like box five (90:52 - 90:56)
everywhere (90:54 - 90:56)
yeah (90:56 - 90:59)
it is it is it is some (90:56 - 91:01)
two steps forward one step backwards (90:59 - 91:03)
yeah uh (91:01 - 91:04)
i believe (91:03 - 91:07)
you unlock mass at some point if you (91:04 - 91:09)
talk to the pastor people they say oh (91:07 - 91:10)
you can now release they let you know (91:09 - 91:12)
when you can now release (91:10 - 91:14)
and it is (91:12 - 91:17)
surprisingly well done yes (91:14 - 91:19)
and it is great (91:17 - 91:21)
that if you try to mass release and (91:19 - 91:22)
there's a shiny in the bunch it will (91:21 - 91:24)
yell at you it will yell at you (91:22 - 91:26)
um i still think pokemon go has the best (91:24 - 91:28)
system for (91:26 - 91:30)
signifying that it's a shiny before you (91:28 - 91:32)
even tap on it like letting you know (91:30 - 91:34)
it's a shiny like (91:32 - 91:34)
whatever (91:34 - 91:36)
game freak is doing just look at what (91:34 - 91:37)
pokemon go is doing because they figured (91:36 - 91:39)
out how to throw away pokemon very well (91:37 - 91:40)
in that game yeah because it's very (91:39 - 91:43)
important to do (91:40 - 91:43)
and it's very important to see that it's (91:43 - 91:46)
a like the one thing i think would (91:44 - 91:48)
really make it great is you can see it's (91:46 - 91:50)
you can see it's a shiny in the circle (91:48 - 91:52)
but again for people who are colorblind (91:50 - 91:54)
you have to like hit the start button (91:52 - 91:56)
like twice to like toggle it and stuff (91:54 - 91:58)
and they put the shiny in the in the (91:56 - 92:01)
pasture specifically they put the (91:58 - 92:03)
star on a white background and the star (92:01 - 92:05)
is like gray (92:03 - 92:07)
it's kind of hard to see if your eyes (92:05 - 92:08)
aren't great (92:07 - 92:10)
um so it'd be nice if there was a symbol (92:08 - 92:12)
on top of the pokemon in the pasture (92:10 - 92:15)
like in pogo their symbol is in the (92:12 - 92:17)
upper right left hand corner i think (92:15 - 92:19)
um so they're close they've gotten much (92:17 - 92:21)
better the like the shiny being in the (92:19 - 92:24)
name is is fantastic and it's it's great (92:21 - 92:26)
they finally got there (92:24 - 92:28)
um (92:26 - 92:30)
that's all i got i mean obviously i can (92:28 - 92:31)
keep going for another hour but we'll (92:30 - 92:34)
save it for the next episode (92:31 - 92:34)
still enjoying the game though still (92:35 - 92:39)
think if you're still on the fence (92:37 - 92:41)
like i said the only reason you probably (92:39 - 92:43)
wouldn't want to pick up this game is if (92:41 - 92:46)
the if battling is your favorite part of (92:43 - 92:47)
pokemon i agree um that's probably the (92:46 - 92:50)
only reason why you might be not pick it (92:47 - 92:51)
up if you like collecting if you like (92:50 - 92:53)
exploring if you like the story of (92:51 - 92:55)
pokemon if you like the lore of pokemon (92:53 - 92:59)
um if you like discoverability (92:55 - 93:02)
100 worth it yeah it's a great it is a (92:59 - 93:05)
great great game with (93:02 - 93:08)
some minor drawbacks (93:05 - 93:10)
it's not a perfect game but (93:08 - 93:12)
it is (93:10 - 93:14)
it is well worth the money and if you (93:12 - 93:16)
tell me the graphics are good go to the (93:14 - 93:17)
third area and catch any water type (93:16 - 93:19)
pokemon and come back to me and tell me (93:17 - 93:21)
the graphics are good because i think (93:19 - 93:23)
every single pixel on the pokeball in (93:21 - 93:25)
that water it is uh i don't know who (93:23 - 93:26)
made that (93:25 - 93:28)
or who thought that was okay (93:26 - 93:29)
or why the wrath looks like it's ripped (93:28 - 93:33)
out of a super nintendo game (93:29 - 93:35)
but man this game looks bad at times (93:33 - 93:37)
at times (93:35 - 93:39)
at times (93:37 - 93:41)
well that lava was not flowing the way (93:39 - 93:43)
lava should float look it's fantasy lava (93:41 - 93:45)
the fact that you can stand next to it (93:43 - 93:46)
at all is a miracle (93:45 - 93:48)
do that in hawaii and see how far you (93:46 - 93:49)
get (93:48 - 93:51)
exactly you know i've never seen lava in (93:49 - 93:53)
real life (93:51 - 93:56)
it is terrifying but it's not only that (93:53 - 93:57)
but you have to stand like a kilometer (93:56 - 94:00)
away like from where you have to stand (93:57 - 94:03)
it looks pixelated to be safe so be (94:00 - 94:05)
happy (94:03 - 94:06)
um (94:05 - 94:08)
