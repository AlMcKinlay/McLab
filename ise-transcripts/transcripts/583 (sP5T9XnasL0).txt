um like the updates like some of that (1:36 - 1:39)
stuff you don't even need to buy the DLC (1:38 - 1:41)

entire story so if you haven't finished (1:52 - 1:58)

not wrong maybe hit the pause button or (1:58 - 2:02)
something I don't know (2:00 - 2:04)
back to it come back to it I I don't (2:02 - 2:06)
think waiting a whole week to talk (2:04 - 2:09)
another whole week to talk about it is I (2:06 - 2:09)
don't know you're listening to a Pokemon (2:09 - 2:12)
podcast probably because (2:09 - 2:15)
you consume Pokemon things (2:12 - 2:17)
there's not a lot to consume (2:15 - 2:21)
uh okay let's talk off uh talk about the (2:17 - 2:22)
first bit where are my notes uh let's (2:21 - 2:24)
talk about the first bit of news (2:22 - 2:27)
uh our Pokemon sleep check-in as we've (2:24 - 2:30)
been doing for the last like six weeks (2:27 - 2:33)
uh did you guys get your mime or your (2:30 - 2:37)
mime Junior that debuted in the last (2:33 - 2:39)
week (2:37 - 2:42)
I got a mime Junior also I've noticed (2:39 - 2:46)
that my sleep has now just decided to (2:42 - 2:48)
decide when I went to sleep and when I (2:46 - 2:50)
woke up regardless of what buttons I hit (2:48 - 2:52)
it's just like nah you only slept this (2:50 - 2:53)
much (2:52 - 2:57)
that's not accurate but fine whatever (2:53 - 2:59)
like today I did not wake up until nine (2:57 - 3:02)
it's like oh you woke up at 8 30. (2:59 - 3:04)
no (3:02 - 3:06)
no I I rolled over opened my eyes at (3:04 - 3:09)
nine and hit the button but sure (3:06 - 3:13)
too much movement you do you friends not (3:09 - 3:16)
seeing enough movement (3:13 - 3:18)
Hannah did you get your mime I did not (3:16 - 3:20)
I've been at the beach and I've been (3:18 - 3:22)
getting better sleep than I have almost (3:20 - 3:24)
in the rest of my entire life and I have (3:22 - 3:27)
not found a mime or of my Junior at all (3:24 - 3:30)
and that's fine you get you need worse (3:27 - 3:32)
sleep so the Nightmare Horror that is Mr (3:30 - 3:35)
mime shows up that's yeah you have to (3:32 - 3:37)
have bad sleep so the horror monster (3:35 - 3:41)
comes you're sleeping too good uh I (3:37 - 3:43)
gotta I got a mime junior he was not (3:41 - 3:46)
hungry so I had to throw multiple this I (3:43 - 3:47)
threw multiple biscuits because I was (3:46 - 3:49)
like I bet I'm not gonna get another one (3:47 - 3:53)
and I did I did not so I have one now (3:49 - 3:53)
um (3:53 - 3:56)
did you uh the other (3:53 - 3:58)
apparently uh new Pokemon are coming (3:56 - 4:00)
they've said that in the app (3:58 - 4:04)
they also said to celebrate with us you (4:00 - 4:07)
can spend fifty dollars if you would (4:04 - 4:12)
like on what does that look of love I'm (4:07 - 4:14)
not exaggerating it is a legit a 50 (4:12 - 4:17)
dollar pun (4:14 - 4:20)
it is kind of insane I don't understand (4:17 - 4:22)
why they think these are reasonable (4:20 - 4:26)
prices for boxes (4:22 - 4:26)
oh it is it is it is called the 100 (4:26 - 4:32)
million Pokemon befriend bundle medium (4:29 - 4:36)
which is 20 great biscuits six friend (4:32 - 4:38)
incense which are kind of like some of (4:36 - 4:40)
the better ones uh (4:38 - 4:43)
hard candy small 10 hard candy medium (4:40 - 4:45)
three (4:43 - 4:47)
which I don't know how rare the candy (4:45 - 4:50)
stuff is because they've given a lot in (4:47 - 4:52)
the last month but I I literally just (4:50 - 4:54)
had to spend it because I didn't have (4:52 - 4:56)
space so I was like I feel like I'm (4:54 - 4:59)
wasting this because I have to put I (4:56 - 5:01)
have to pump it into somebody but also (4:59 - 5:03)
like I I just don't have the space to (5:01 - 5:07)
hold like 70 candy out of my 120 bag you (5:03 - 5:09)
just gotta spend the gems to upgrade the (5:07 - 5:10)
bag (5:09 - 5:14)
have upgraded the bag but then it kept (5:10 - 5:17)
being more and more candy (5:14 - 5:17)
it's cool that they're celebrating (5:18 - 5:22)
hitting 100 million (5:20 - 5:25)
uh players though (5:22 - 5:30)
yeah I I mean besides the the money (5:25 - 5:30)
they did also give some things out for (5:30 - 5:34)
free they got they gave out another free (5:32 - 5:38)
bundle that was nice it also made my uh (5:34 - 5:41)
inventory hit the top and I had to spend (5:38 - 5:44)
some things or use some items to accept (5:41 - 5:47)
all of the gifts uh on the free end of (5:44 - 5:49)
things the even though the game is (5:47 - 5:52)
asking for for your money uh they're (5:49 - 5:54)
bought they're like gift bundles are way (5:52 - 5:56)
better than Niantic has ever done oh (5:54 - 5:59)
yeah oh yeah (5:56 - 5:59)
keep hitting Milestones or something (6:02 - 6:05)
because every time they give gifts it's (6:04 - 6:08)
pretty good (6:05 - 6:08)
keep hitting keep hitting different (6:09 - 6:14)
Milestones uh speaking of money (6:11 - 6:17)
the Santa Cruz skateboard collection (6:14 - 6:22)
came out it sure did and left (6:17 - 6:22)
and if uh if you had any expectations at (6:23 - 6:31)
all that lasted about 30 seconds before (6:28 - 6:34)
Oh everything out the window (6:31 - 6:37)
um so I learned a couple things here (6:34 - 6:38)
number one (6:37 - 6:42)
uh scalpers nothing is off limit for (6:38 - 6:44)
scalpers tickets (6:42 - 6:50)
uh Pokemon cards Escape skateboards (6:44 - 6:50)
uh number two (6:51 - 6:59)
is uh I I I don't think I've hated Tick (6:53 - 7:02)
Tock anymore in the past week than (6:59 - 7:04)
watching people just appear (7:02 - 7:09)
and be like I'm opening 10 of these also (7:04 - 7:13)
cool I would have loved to get one but (7:09 - 7:15)
that's cool that you got 10. also the (7:13 - 7:17)
skateboard came out this morning how do (7:15 - 7:19)
you have ten I don't know probably (7:17 - 7:21)
because your buddy works at Zumiez and (7:19 - 7:24)
sold them to you or something (7:21 - 7:28)
uh number three I've learned almost (7:24 - 7:31)
every single tick tocker called Ivysaur (7:28 - 7:34)
Bulbasaur (7:31 - 7:34)
look they are scalpers not Pokemon (7:34 - 7:41)
professionals I didn't see a single tick (7:37 - 7:45)
tocker properly say ivysaur's name it (7:41 - 7:47)
was all Bulbasaur one person called him (7:45 - 7:51)
Venusaur so shout out to that person (7:47 - 7:51)
um (7:51 - 7:54)
here was my plan my I wanted two (7:51 - 7:56)
skateboards I wanted one skateboard for (7:54 - 7:58)
the wall and I won one skateboard to (7:56 - 8:02)
ride and I I have been eyeing (7:58 - 8:04)
skateboards for a long time we have a (8:02 - 8:06)
lot of skateboard shops here in the Twin (8:04 - 8:08)
Cities I've been I've been to them with (8:06 - 8:10)
will I'm always like maybe I should get (8:08 - 8:14)
a skateboard and then I never do uh (8:10 - 8:16)
and I my thought process is if I bought (8:14 - 8:19)
two uh whichever the bad one was which (8:16 - 8:22)
would probably be Ivysaur it would be (8:19 - 8:23)
the one I would ride and then if I got (8:22 - 8:25)
like a Pikachu or me too that's the one (8:23 - 8:28)
I would go on the wall woke up at (8:25 - 8:29)
um (8:28 - 8:30)
what what they went on sale I think at (8:29 - 8:32)
eight or something eight or nine I woke (8:30 - 8:34)
up five minutes before had my alarm set (8:32 - 8:35)
sat there (8:34 - 8:38)
and they were already on the website and (8:35 - 8:40)
everything said coming soon like you (8:38 - 8:42)
could see all the items that they were (8:40 - 8:43)
they were about to sell they all said (8:42 - 8:46)
coming soon and then 8080 8 o'clock came (8:43 - 8:49)
still coming soon for the skateboard but (8:46 - 8:51)
the hoodies and stuff started coming in (8:49 - 8:52)
stock (8:51 - 8:55)
and then 801 still coming soon 802. it (8:52 - 8:58)
said unavailable and I was like oh are (8:55 - 9:01)
we done because I did it hasn't come in (8:58 - 9:04)
stock 803 coming soon I was like okay (9:01 - 9:07)
and then 804 and Beyond unavailable (9:04 - 9:11)
there was no point ever (9:07 - 9:13)
that I could add this to my cart it was (9:11 - 9:15)
just coming soon coming soon unavailable (9:13 - 9:17)
coming soon unavailable and then never (9:15 - 9:20)
never came in stock and then gone that's (9:17 - 9:23)
wild I I did get a hoodie (9:20 - 9:25)
um (9:23 - 9:27)
so I (9:25 - 9:30)
yeah that was okay I guess uh that (9:27 - 9:34)
hasn't shipped yet (9:30 - 9:34)
uh uh and then I (9:34 - 9:39)
called every skate shop (9:36 - 9:42)
it's a true story I did it while I was (9:39 - 9:44)
live streaming the DLC I called every (9:42 - 9:46)
skate shop and (9:44 - 9:49)
um they all said they were sold out uh (9:46 - 9:52)
there was a couple skate shops (9:49 - 9:54)
uh so so Zoomies was like the big (9:52 - 9:56)
partner I think (9:54 - 9:58)
um and I believe from at least I caught (9:56 - 10:00)
we had three Zoomies here in the the (9:58 - 10:03)
cities and one of them told me that each (10:00 - 10:05)
zoomy's got about 10 in (10:03 - 10:08)
uh uh I don't know how true that is that (10:05 - 10:10)
he said like all our zoo of the Zoomies (10:08 - 10:12)
in the area all got 10 in so that's (10:10 - 10:14)
maybe maybe in like New York or (10:12 - 10:15)
something they got more because (10:14 - 10:17)
obviously New York's a bigger city but (10:15 - 10:20)
um I called like a Vans and then some of (10:17 - 10:22)
my twitch chat also said like their Vans (10:20 - 10:25)
only got one in so if you're a van store (10:22 - 10:27)
you only got like one maybe a couple (10:25 - 10:28)
more (10:27 - 10:30)
um and then I called three local skate (10:28 - 10:32)
shops they didn't tell me how many they (10:30 - 10:34)
got uh but it sounded like (10:32 - 10:38)
they had them for more than 10 seconds (10:34 - 10:41)
uh sounded like theirs lasted maybe 30 (10:38 - 10:42)
minutes or so probably because people (10:41 - 10:45)
did go to Zoomies or (10:42 - 10:46)
um (10:45 - 10:48)
what was the uh the van store (10:46 - 10:51)
um but everyone is sold out by noon (10:48 - 10:52)
because that's when I called I called (10:51 - 10:55)
that like 11 11 30. I asked them all if (10:52 - 10:57)
they got we were getting restocks they (10:55 - 10:59)
all said no except the one Zumi said (10:57 - 11:02)
there was a restock there was apparently (10:59 - 11:05)
a Pokemon launch party on Saturday at (11:02 - 11:08)
select Zoomies from two to five (11:05 - 11:10)
and there would be a restock uh which (11:08 - 11:12)
was yesterday as we're recording this (11:10 - 11:14)
podcast I wish I could come on the show (11:12 - 11:16)
and tell you what a Pokemon launch party (11:14 - 11:20)
at Zumiez would have been like uh but I (11:16 - 11:21)
was very ill yesterday (11:20 - 11:24)
so I unfortunately did not get to go (11:21 - 11:26)
well here I wrote it down it was the uh (11:24 - 11:31)
Ridgedale Zoomies oh fancy Zoomies (11:26 - 11:33)
so not Mall of America Zoomies which you (11:31 - 11:35)
would think would be the place they (11:33 - 11:38)
would hold it but nah bridgedale's a (11:35 - 11:40)
fancier mall now (11:38 - 11:43)
um so (11:40 - 11:46)
um as for resale prices these boards (11:43 - 11:49)
were a hundred and nine dollars (11:46 - 11:53)
uh most on eBay (11:49 - 11:57)
uh unopened so you know good you know (11:53 - 11:58)
you're just you're just buying it and (11:57 - 12:00)
opening it for yourself are about three (11:58 - 12:02)
hundred dollars (12:00 - 12:06)
uh there are 50 gold (12:02 - 12:08)
poke skateboards there's there's five of (12:06 - 12:11)
them so 250 in the world (12:08 - 12:15)
Charizard Mimi Q Pikachu Gyarados and uh (12:11 - 12:19)
Evie and I believe the Pikachu sold the (12:15 - 12:21)
highest which was around I think four (12:19 - 12:23)
thousand dollars and then the EV sold (12:21 - 12:26)
for three thousand and fifty dollars I (12:23 - 12:28)
know I've also learned this on Tick Tock (12:26 - 12:29)
that Tick Tock people don't know how (12:28 - 12:31)
eBay Works they're like look at this (12:29 - 12:33)
skateboard for eight thousand dollars no (12:31 - 12:35)
it has not sold it has been eight (12:33 - 12:38)
thousand dollars for four days no one (12:35 - 12:40)
has bought it the ones that have sold as (12:38 - 12:43)
of this podcast were a Pikachu it did (12:40 - 12:45)
have like 50 bids it sold for four (12:43 - 12:47)
thousand Evie had like 50 bids sold for (12:45 - 12:48)
like three thousand (12:47 - 12:51)
uh maybe when this show goes up here I (12:48 - 12:53)
don't I don't think Gyarados outsells a (12:51 - 12:55)
Pikachu or an Evie I don't think so (12:53 - 13:00)
I think maybe not I think Charizard does (12:55 - 13:01)
um (13:00 - 13:03)
I do not think uh I don't know Gyarados (13:01 - 13:06)
is cool but he he you know he ain't no (13:03 - 13:07)
mascot (13:06 - 13:10)
he ain't no starter Pokemon (13:07 - 13:10)
um (13:10 - 13:14)
so yeah they they look cool (13:11 - 13:16)
um they're skateboards uh the other (13:14 - 13:18)
thing I learned is apparently he's uh (13:16 - 13:20)
not to me Santa Cruz has done this (13:18 - 13:23)
before with other brands the actual like (13:20 - 13:27)
blind uh box thing which I didn't know (13:23 - 13:30)
um so that's probably why (13:27 - 13:32)
uh uh that's probably why these were (13:30 - 13:36)
just treated the same because apparently (13:32 - 13:39)
releases like this at Santa Cruz gets (13:36 - 13:41)
bought out and then goes up on eBay so I (13:39 - 13:44)
don't I'm sure the Pokemon brand helped (13:41 - 13:47)
but I'm sure any brand would have been (13:44 - 13:49)
purchased as quickly as possible and put (13:47 - 13:53)
up on eBay as quickly as possible (13:49 - 13:53)
it'd be nice for a reprint (13:53 - 14:02)
uh if if they're gonna do that but I (13:57 - 14:05)
uh I don't think so (14:02 - 14:05)
did all the clothing sell out (14:06 - 14:12)
um no not all of it unless they uh (14:09 - 14:13)
there's something like grip tape that's (14:12 - 14:15)
still in stock right yeah (14:13 - 14:16)
okay (14:15 - 14:18)
the green hoodie I think sold out (14:16 - 14:21)
relatively quickly I bought the women's (14:18 - 14:22)
hoodie I don't know (14:21 - 14:25)
it did look like the other hoodie I was (14:22 - 14:27)
like I like this one better I'm not sure (14:25 - 14:28)
why it's women's probably because like (14:27 - 14:29)
the shoulders are maybe thinner or (14:28 - 14:32)
something but uh that one that one sold (14:29 - 14:33)
out last anyways (14:32 - 14:36)
um yeah but like when I say last it was (14:33 - 14:40)
like it was up for like 20 extra minutes (14:36 - 14:40)
but I like that one the best I thought I (14:40 - 14:44)
had the best design (14:42 - 14:44)
yeah um (14:46 - 14:49)
it sounds like a lot of people were were (14:50 - 14:56)
want I I (14:53 - 14:58)
I'm always shocked that like skateboards (14:56 - 15:00)
sell really well even though like a lot (14:58 - 15:02)
of them end up on walls I'm not sure (15:00 - 15:05)
what the correlation between (15:02 - 15:09)
Brands and skateboards are but (15:05 - 15:09)
here we go here we are again here we are (15:10 - 15:15)
in the wonderful world of scalping on (15:13 - 15:20)
eBay yup went about as expected (15:15 - 15:20)
I don't know how (15:20 - 15:23)
we deal with this trend like I think (15:25 - 15:30)
there's like no way to stop this sort of (15:28 - 15:32)
nightmare thing unless the company's (15:30 - 15:33)
actively (15:32 - 15:37)
take any sort of steps to try to like (15:33 - 15:39)
control the timing of their stock or say (15:37 - 15:41)
limit one per customer but even then so (15:39 - 15:43)
many people set up these robot computers (15:41 - 15:45)
like I have (15:43 - 15:47)
17 Gmail addresses and they're all gonna (15:45 - 15:49)
buy one (15:47 - 15:52)
or maybe like one per person but again (15:49 - 15:56)
that doesn't stop employees from (15:52 - 15:59)
uh the chart update (15:56 - 16:02)
uh there is a Charizard at six thousand (15:59 - 16:05)
dollars with three bids so (16:02 - 16:07)
Charizard the the eight thousand dollar (16:05 - 16:09)
to Gyarados that has been up since (16:07 - 16:12)
Wednesday is still on eBay with no bids (16:09 - 16:14)
I just want to say that Gyarados has (16:12 - 16:16)
been on eBay at 8 000 with no bids for (16:14 - 16:18)
multiple days now uh Charizard has three (16:16 - 16:20)
bids six thousand dollars as of this (16:18 - 16:23)
recording this grip tape which is on 45 (16:20 - 16:26)
400 oh it's grip tape and the board I (16:23 - 16:27)
was gonna say like the grip tape why (16:26 - 16:29)
who's buying the script it's still in (16:27 - 16:30)
stock (16:29 - 16:33)
don't buy it off eBay (16:30 - 16:36)
um I do like that eBay people are very (16:33 - 16:38)
good at click bait (16:36 - 16:40)
and I like the ones that take a picture (16:38 - 16:43)
of the gold boards on the packaging and (16:40 - 16:46)
says and in the title it says gold foil (16:43 - 16:52)
possible yeah and those have more bids (16:46 - 16:52)
just because they put gold foil pot it's (16:53 - 16:59)
like uh in for for um (16:56 - 17:02)
people who like Paul Charizard in like (16:59 - 17:03)
the TCG (17:02 - 17:10)
on eBay they'll put possibly PSA 10 (17:03 - 17:13)
but it's not even graded (17:10 - 17:13)
because people search for the words PSA (17:15 - 17:22)
10. so those go to the top (17:18 - 17:26)
possibly ancient Mew (17:22 - 17:26)
there's a charmeleon for 600 no one's (17:28 - 17:34)
buying it nobody's buying Charmeleon (17:31 - 17:38)
hey Ivysaur has uh Ivysaur has uh 200 (17:34 - 17:41)
and 50 cents (17:38 - 17:41)
all right Ivysaur is not that bad (17:41 - 17:49)
that's a rigging endorsement obviously (17:46 - 17:52)
these are bad things Charizard is not as (17:49 - 17:53)
bad (17:52 - 17:56)
as Ivysaur just less distinguishable (17:53 - 17:59)
than the other two that's all (17:56 - 18:02)
obviously was like a top 800 Pokemon (17:59 - 18:04)
look he's like yeah it's definitely (18:02 - 18:06)
within the top 800. (18:04 - 18:10)
for sure the top thousand (18:06 - 18:10)
um Venus are doing a little better here (18:11 - 18:17)
like 285 a little a little more than I (18:13 - 18:18)
don't see any bubble Source though it's (18:17 - 18:20)
very clear well I mean that skateboard (18:18 - 18:23)
can Mega so yeah Mega skateboard the (18:20 - 18:26)
skateboards I saw opened the most were (18:23 - 18:29)
were Ivysaur (18:26 - 18:30)
I actually didn't see anyone open a (18:29 - 18:33)
charmeleon and (18:30 - 18:34)
um (18:33 - 18:37)
Snorlax surprisingly like the one of the (18:34 - 18:40)
guys that bought like 10 skateboards (18:37 - 18:43)
he opened three of them were Snorlax (18:40 - 18:45)
and then I can't he didn't get any gold (18:43 - 18:47)
I can't remember he got like Mew Mewtwo (18:45 - 18:49)
Pikachu all that stuff and then he (18:47 - 18:51)
decided to ride one of the snorlaxes (18:49 - 18:53)
which was like that was like I was like (18:51 - 18:55)
angry I was like watching him open all (18:53 - 18:58)
10 and I'm like fuming I was like and (18:55 - 19:00)
then like he decided to ride one of them (18:58 - 19:02)
and I was like okay well at least like (19:00 - 19:04)
you're the only person I've seen ride (19:02 - 19:07)
one so like it kind of was cool to see (19:04 - 19:09)
it get beat up and be like okay nope (19:07 - 19:12)
it's a skateboard it is indeed a (19:09 - 19:15)
skateboard you definitely can skate (19:12 - 19:17)
onset skateboard that's a sick board (19:15 - 19:19)
Slide Man (19:17 - 19:23)
it's even radical (19:19 - 19:23)
um (19:24 - 19:28)
yeah I mean whatever things are sought (19:25 - 19:30)
after I'll go back to collecting 100 (19:28 - 19:32)
metal pokeballs because apparently (19:30 - 19:34)
scalpers don't care about those I'm (19:32 - 19:36)
still waiting for the luxury ball I have (19:34 - 19:39)
money set aside it's supposed to be this (19:36 - 19:42)
year yeah no coming out soon (19:39 - 19:44)
that's it enough the money's just (19:42 - 19:46)
sitting into my savings account doing (19:44 - 19:48)
nothing taunting me to like spend it on (19:46 - 19:50)
actually food or something since I don't (19:48 - 19:52)
have a job still it's like you should (19:50 - 19:54)
maybe pay a bill and I'm like no this is (19:52 - 19:58)
luxury ball money it's earmarked (19:54 - 20:00)
uh (19:58 - 20:02)
uh the last bit of (20:00 - 20:06)
non-dlc news I think is well there's two (20:02 - 20:07)
there's number one there's the (20:06 - 20:10)
illustration contest that's coming back (20:07 - 20:11)
um (20:10 - 20:13)
I can't I don't have enough energy to (20:11 - 20:15)
complain about it like I do every year (20:13 - 20:17)
but there are very talented artists out (20:15 - 20:19)
there so shout out to the people with (20:17 - 20:21)
Talent not me (20:19 - 20:23)
um Greg uh did you try Blaziken in (20:21 - 20:26)
Pokemon unite uh I haven't I've seen (20:23 - 20:29)
because it's still it's still gems right (20:26 - 20:31)
like it's still it's not coins yet (20:29 - 20:37)
um I've seen Blaziken being played and (20:31 - 20:37)
it is one of the (20:38 - 20:44)
most high skill ones they've added like (20:41 - 20:46)
you have to know what you're doing (20:44 - 20:50)
because it's unite move switches it (20:46 - 20:53)
between a different so it has one set of (20:50 - 20:55)
attacks and when you ignite it switches (20:53 - 20:57)
it to the other set of attacks so it's (20:55 - 21:00)
unite move charges really quickly so (20:57 - 21:02)
that you can pop between (21:00 - 21:04)
all the different attacks which is like (21:02 - 21:06)
it doesn't Mega does it it doesn't make (21:04 - 21:08)
a oh okay okay (21:06 - 21:10)
but (21:08 - 21:14)
knowing when to switch between and use (21:10 - 21:16)
your unite property like I need distance (21:14 - 21:18)
or I need power like (21:16 - 21:21)
I think it's a very good and balanced (21:18 - 21:24)
Pokemon but I think people are mad at it (21:21 - 21:27)
because it really requires a lot of (21:24 - 21:30)
skill to play well and if you don't know (21:27 - 21:32)
what you're doing like I have no idea (21:30 - 21:33)
how to play that thing I'm like I have (21:32 - 21:36)
no clue when I should be switching I (21:33 - 21:39)
have no idea what's appropriate (21:36 - 21:43)
um it feels real it feels real real bad (21:39 - 21:44)
um especially since they still haven't (21:43 - 21:47)
nerfed Mewtwo Y and The Meta is (21:44 - 21:50)
atrocious right now like the game is (21:47 - 21:52)
back in a place where (21:50 - 21:55)
you either are steamrolled or you (21:52 - 21:59)
steamroll there's no it's so rare that (21:55 - 22:00)
you have something in between right now (21:59 - 22:04)
because things are so unbalanced and I (22:00 - 22:05)
think people are really hoping Blaziken (22:04 - 22:07)
would change the balance and it probably (22:05 - 22:10)
will for people who know how to play (22:07 - 22:13)
that character if you don't it's it's (22:10 - 22:16)
nigh impossible to like get the best out (22:13 - 22:18)
of that out of the thing it's cool but (22:16 - 22:22)
yeah it's it's a toughie it sounds cool (22:18 - 22:24)
because I feel like in the past (22:22 - 22:28)
uh like we had um (22:24 - 22:30)
we had uh (22:28 - 22:33)
we had that unite podcast and it was (22:30 - 22:36)
like oh if you just want to like easily (22:33 - 22:38)
win on ladder just like pick Mewtwo or (22:36 - 22:41)
zashian and and just spend the win (22:38 - 22:44)
button that is still the case which is (22:41 - 22:46)
like look there are there are definitely (22:44 - 22:49)
the game tells you like this is a easy (22:46 - 22:51)
Pokemon to play or this is a hard (22:49 - 22:53)
Pokemon to play but I never felt like (22:51 - 22:55)
the ones that said they were hard were (22:53 - 22:58)
actually like that much harder (22:55 - 22:59)
um so it's cool that you're saying like (22:58 - 23:00)
this one has like a different skill (22:59 - 23:02)
level like yeah in my head I'm thinking (23:00 - 23:06)
like Hoopa is a lot harder to play (23:02 - 23:09)
um and like Muse a lot harder to play (23:06 - 23:10)
because it's important to sort of know (23:09 - 23:13)
which moves to pick at which time which (23:10 - 23:17)
I think Blaziken is more complicated (23:13 - 23:18)
than that because you can just stick (23:17 - 23:21)
with your same Muse moves with Mew and (23:18 - 23:23)
get the benefit and just be like this is (23:21 - 23:26)
the way I play it you really have to (23:23 - 23:28)
understand and master both sides of (23:26 - 23:30)
Blaziken to get the most out of that (23:28 - 23:32)
character it I I'm the thing that makes (23:30 - 23:36)
me excited about it is I want to see (23:32 - 23:38)
how it plays with professionals I want (23:36 - 23:40)
to see a professional (23:38 - 23:43)
be good at that character and wreck (23:40 - 23:47)
house because it is (23:43 - 23:49)
it also it's a weird chicken so it's (23:47 - 23:53)
just fun to watch it run around but (23:49 - 23:54)
um (23:53 - 23:56)
no seeing somebody who really really (23:54 - 23:58)
really really knows how to play it makes (23:56 - 24:00)
it much more exciting and you're like (23:58 - 24:03)
wow I wish I could do that I can't I (24:00 - 24:05)
have no way of doing that it's so (24:03 - 24:07)
complicated really good to know that I (24:05 - 24:09)
shouldn't come back to unite for one of (24:07 - 24:11)
my favorite Pokemon because I can barely (24:09 - 24:13)
play the easy characters yeah I think (24:11 - 24:15)
like (24:13 - 24:18)
a lot of people have multiple Mains like (24:15 - 24:20)
oh I can switch to this if the one that (24:18 - 24:23)
I want and I really think if you're a (24:20 - 24:25)
Blaziken main you just need to stay with (24:23 - 24:26)
Blaziken and learn how to play it and (24:25 - 24:29)
that's like the character you play (24:26 - 24:30)
um to be really really good at it and (24:29 - 24:32)
again I will say that nothing in unite (24:30 - 24:34)
is all that difficult it is sort of like (24:32 - 24:37)
Point yourself at another thing and hit (24:34 - 24:40)
the button and try to kill it I think (24:37 - 24:44)
what make Blaziken more difficult is the (24:40 - 24:45)
fact that (24:44 - 24:48)
to get the most out of it to actually (24:45 - 24:50)
have it really feel like it's pulling (24:48 - 24:52)
its weight compared to a mewtwoi which (24:50 - 24:53)
is literally just look in the direction (24:52 - 24:56)
of something hit a button it explodes (24:53 - 25:00)
um yeah you you really need to (24:56 - 25:03)
to be aware of how the game plays and (25:00 - 25:05)
and the right moments to do the right (25:03 - 25:06)
thing (25:05 - 25:09)
um I will never say like any of the (25:06 - 25:11)
characters are all that difficult really (25:09 - 25:14)
all that difficult to play to to be able (25:11 - 25:17)
to to win a match but if you want to (25:14 - 25:20)
really be able to turn the tide you (25:17 - 25:21)
really have to know how to play that (25:20 - 25:23)
character (25:21 - 25:23)
um and then mimikyu is next right (25:26 - 25:30)
mimikyu is next (25:27 - 25:33)
cool which is another is yeah I think (25:30 - 25:35)
that's mimikyu and then meowskarata I (25:33 - 25:39)
think that's the order which uh two very (25:35 - 25:43)
popular Pokemon mm-hmm yeah probably the (25:39 - 25:45)
uh the starter that came out on top with (25:43 - 25:47)
uh popularity (25:45 - 25:49)
it's got a weird shadow teleportability (25:47 - 25:52)
that I've seen (25:49 - 25:55)
uh it I've only seen it move like I've (25:52 - 25:57)
seen a start clip of it and I'm vastly (25:55 - 26:00)
curious how that whole thing works (25:57 - 26:03)
love how the the cat's standing up (26:00 - 26:05)
and the most popular one (26:03 - 26:09)
it's almost like the Pokemon company (26:05 - 26:12)
knows Their audience more than like (26:09 - 26:14)
Twitter just complaining they don't want (26:12 - 26:16)
a cat to stand up I mean I still don't (26:14 - 26:19)
want a cat to stand up but (26:16 - 26:23)
but other people do but other people do (26:19 - 26:26)
barely a lot of other people want the (26:23 - 26:29)
game they did pretty well (26:26 - 26:32)
I mean I I don't love meowskarada I (26:29 - 26:34)
don't hate it I think I think he's cool (26:32 - 26:37)
but um I like consider her a lot uh but (26:34 - 26:39)
I don't think that's because incident (26:37 - 26:40)
we're standing I think that's just (26:39 - 26:42)
because you know when it's dinner is (26:40 - 26:43)
based off of it was something I just (26:42 - 26:46)
really like so (26:43 - 26:49)
maybe there's a lot of magician fans out (26:46 - 26:53)
there there are so many magic people out (26:49 - 26:55)
there who are into the Magics and not (26:53 - 26:57)
the Gathering the actual pulling things (26:55 - 26:58)
of the Gathering (26:57 - 27:02)
all right uh we'll gather ourselves up (26:58 - 27:03)
for a break here and then when we come (27:02 - 27:05)
back we are going to talk about DLC (27:03 - 27:07)
again we're going to be talking about uh (27:05 - 27:09)
first we're gonna be talking about like (27:07 - 27:12)
the update itself which adds a lot (27:09 - 27:15)
um and then you know when we if you (27:12 - 27:16)
haven't finished the story we'll let (27:15 - 27:18)
we'll give you a clear indicator of when (27:16 - 27:21)
Story Time happens so uh we will be (27:18 - 27:23)
right back (27:21 - 27:26)
and we are back from our break (27:23 - 27:31)
uh so the DLC came out around what was (27:26 - 27:33)
it like eight o'clock yeah Central Time (27:31 - 27:36)
on Tuesday right on time as every report (27:33 - 27:38)
so choke on that actually the Sports (27:36 - 27:41)
Illustrated called it and it was right (27:38 - 27:44)
yeah we can always rely on Sports (27:41 - 27:46)
Illustrated for the latest and greatest (27:44 - 27:49)
Pokemon news (27:46 - 27:50)
um (27:49 - 27:52)
uh which would have been about 10 a.m (27:50 - 27:56)
Japan time which the official (27:52 - 27:58)
quote was it will come out the morning (27:56 - 28:01)
of Japan (27:58 - 28:01)
the only morning that exists it's 10 (28:01 - 28:05)
o'clock (28:03 - 28:05)
10 a.m is apparently what Pokemon (28:06 - 28:11)
considers morning so uh it came out uh (28:07 - 28:13)
we also got the (28:11 - 28:16)
2.0.1 update (28:13 - 28:19)
which uh for me was (28:16 - 28:22)
did it fix the leg (28:19 - 28:26)
I'm gonna say no it did not (28:22 - 28:26)
I I will say there again this maybe this (28:28 - 28:34)
is a placebo or or maybe I've just been (28:31 - 28:36)
playing too long I do feel like there (28:34 - 28:38)
are instances where it's like slightly (28:36 - 28:40)
smoother (28:38 - 28:43)
um like I feel like there's like a three (28:40 - 28:45)
second period from going from point A to (28:43 - 28:48)
point B in like the 30 seconds three of (28:45 - 28:50)
those 30 seconds I'm like oh this is it (28:48 - 28:52)
feels a little smoother right here (28:50 - 28:55)
but I did try leg like I did try the (28:52 - 28:57)
like Forest (28:55 - 28:57)
um (28:57 - 29:00)
it's like yeah still and you know it's (28:57 - 29:02)
it's been 10 minutes and it's still (29:00 - 29:05)
laggy the one thing when I went um I (29:02 - 29:06)
want to say it's a festival and they (29:05 - 29:08)
were Fanning themselves and the fans (29:06 - 29:11)
were doing (29:08 - 29:11)
and I'm like (29:11 - 29:13)
come on (29:14 - 29:16)
like yes whether at the festival and the (29:17 - 29:22)
fans are are obviously one frame a (29:20 - 29:25)
second uh (29:22 - 29:25)
just have them hold it it (29:26 - 29:31)
it was just like (29:29 - 29:33)
it's not (29:31 - 29:35)
there's not even a lot of them here (29:33 - 29:38)
there's not even a lot of people yeah (29:35 - 29:39)
there's like not too crowded there's (29:38 - 29:41)
like two people and neither one of them (29:39 - 29:43)
know how to how to how to not (29:41 - 29:46)
robotically move their fan (29:43 - 29:48)
oh and another good check was I went to (29:46 - 29:52)
the Old Reliable Windmill and uh (29:48 - 29:57)
nope and uh if if you're curious (29:52 - 30:00)
Old Reliable for a reason we're still (29:57 - 30:02)
moving at three frames a second on that (30:00 - 30:03)
bad boy (30:02 - 30:06)
um so yeah like that that was uh that (30:03 - 30:08)
was a bit of a bummer that there was not (30:06 - 30:10)
a pro maybe there was a performance (30:08 - 30:12)
thing like there there are people saying (30:10 - 30:13)
they feel like their game runs smoother (30:12 - 30:16)
I said there was like very very when I (30:13 - 30:18)
say small Pockets I mean the tiniest (30:16 - 30:20)
Pockets where it feels like (30:18 - 30:22)
did they fix it oh wait never mind the (30:20 - 30:25)
game's about to lock up (30:22 - 30:29)
um what they did fix is the PC boxes (30:25 - 30:32)
and as much as I we just complained (30:29 - 30:33)
about the frame rate and laughed about (30:32 - 30:36)
it uh I am so happy and it feels great (30:33 - 30:39)
that the PC boxes feel like a normal PC (30:36 - 30:41)
box again I don't know what magic they (30:39 - 30:44)
did for that uh but it it feels great to (30:41 - 30:45)
scroll through the boxes and everything (30:44 - 30:49)
loads at most maybe it's like a half a (30:45 - 30:50)
second but like you can literally see (30:49 - 30:52)
like day and night difference with the (30:50 - 30:54)
PC boxes so they they did they did fix (30:52 - 30:56)
something yeah I will say like I was (30:54 - 30:58)
scrolling through my PC boxes to find (30:56 - 30:59)
something for a raid and I'm like oh I (30:58 - 31:01)
don't have to wait for things to pop in (30:59 - 31:03)
I don't have to have like the bizarre (31:01 - 31:06)
blank Square where I know things are but (31:03 - 31:10)
they haven't loaded in and I appreciate (31:06 - 31:12)
that (31:10 - 31:14)
um (31:12 - 31:19)
again it's it is a minor thing that (31:14 - 31:20)
shouldn't have been a problem in the (31:19 - 31:23)
first place amongst a lot of minor (31:20 - 31:26)
things that are still a problem (31:23 - 31:26)
it's like one of those games where (31:27 - 31:30)
there's so many minor things it just (31:28 - 31:33)
makes you like like hyper like hard not (31:30 - 31:35)
to hyper focus on the things that you (31:33 - 31:37)
notice because it's just like there's a (31:35 - 31:39)
rock in my shoe and every time I shake (31:37 - 31:41)
every time I shake my shoe I see a rock (31:39 - 31:43)
come out and I put my shoe back on and (31:41 - 31:46)
there's another rock in my shoe (31:43 - 31:48)
but there could be a rock in your shoe (31:46 - 31:51)
but if you walk Justice (31:48 - 31:51)
that's this game in a nutshell (31:54 - 32:03)
um so yes so boxes fixed uh frame rate (31:56 - 32:08)
not uh razor mixed bag (32:03 - 32:10)
yeah so there was a fix in the raid (32:08 - 32:13)
um you can now see uh thanks for (32:10 - 32:15)
bringing that up Greg uh you can now see (32:13 - 32:17)
heel cheer and defense chair (32:15 - 32:20)
uh it is you know it was (32:17 - 32:21)
I guess (32:20 - 32:25)
confirmed by Anubis who is uh she is she (32:21 - 32:26)
is one of the people who I don't I don't (32:25 - 32:28)
know if I would consider her a data (32:26 - 32:30)
Miner but she does run software on her (32:28 - 32:31)
computer that just like tells her what's (32:30 - 32:33)
happening in the game she'll she'll post (32:31 - 32:35)
screenshots of it uh but she was the one (32:33 - 32:37)
that can (32:35 - 32:39)
she's the one that kind of confirmed all (32:37 - 32:40)
the recent shiny hunting that's how we (32:39 - 32:42)
know how sword and shield shining (32:40 - 32:43)
hunting Works after three years she was (32:42 - 32:47)
the one that was like I figured it out (32:43 - 32:47)
um (32:47 - 32:49)
she was the one that figured out let's (32:47 - 32:51)
go again three years later we now know (32:49 - 32:53)
how let's go it was because of her (32:51 - 32:55)
um same for Legends Arceus she figured (32:53 - 32:57)
out right away that's when Sarah be (32:55 - 32:58)
updated (32:57 - 33:01)
um and then she figured out it in uh (32:58 - 33:03)
Scarlet Violet so she was the one that (33:01 - 33:07)
said hey these cheers don't stack (33:03 - 33:10)
um they do last random amount of turns (33:07 - 33:12)
uh and then she was like I don't care (33:10 - 33:16)
enough to keep figuring it out (33:12 - 33:20)
very very valid the Pokemon company or (33:16 - 33:22)
anything so uh (33:20 - 33:25)
so we do now we do she was right uh they (33:22 - 33:28)
don't stack you can test it yourself uh (33:25 - 33:30)
you can do two attack shares well in in (33:28 - 33:33)
online multiplayer they don't stack (33:30 - 33:35)
um and they do last a random turns so it (33:33 - 33:37)
can go anywhere between two and six (33:35 - 33:39)
turns it shows you that most of the time (33:37 - 33:42)
it seems to be just two turns (33:39 - 33:45)
um we do now know that the raid boss can (33:42 - 33:47)
clear that buff as well so if you attack (33:45 - 33:49)
cheer and then all of a sudden it says (33:47 - 33:51)
raid boss has cleared your stats it does (33:49 - 33:53)
clear that buff (33:51 - 33:55)
um whether that's defense or attack (33:53 - 33:57)
so (33:55 - 34:00)
um it's a great it's very helpful more (33:57 - 34:02)
communication and raids is really really (34:00 - 34:04)
helpful right like (34:02 - 34:07)
um and hopefully that that in itself (34:04 - 34:10)
tells people that these are good Buffs (34:07 - 34:12)
that you should be using (34:10 - 34:16)
um I I it's it's really a great change I (34:12 - 34:18)
don't think raids (34:16 - 34:21)
run amazingly smooth still like like (34:18 - 34:23)
they they still lock up a little bit but (34:21 - 34:26)
they're not fixed they sure do slightly (34:23 - 34:27)
better (34:26 - 34:31)
I was in one where I was like (34:27 - 34:32)
huh (34:31 - 34:35)
I'm not moving (34:32 - 34:36)
things are happening (34:35 - 34:39)
oh our timer bar is now half (34:36 - 34:42)
I guess a bunch of things died (34:39 - 34:44)
I have no idea what actually happened (34:42 - 34:47)
because when I popped back in apparently (34:44 - 34:49)
to catch up to real time everybody was (34:47 - 34:51)
back up so a number of people had died (34:49 - 34:54)
and Reed spawned in the amount of time (34:51 - 34:57)
it took for my game to be like oh hey (34:54 - 35:00)
did you maybe want to do a move (34:57 - 35:04)
how about now thanks (35:00 - 35:04)
I definitely felt like raids were (35:05 - 35:11)
choppier (35:09 - 35:14)
around like release maybe because that (35:11 - 35:16)
was just like it was a huge influx of (35:14 - 35:18)
people (35:16 - 35:20)
um but like if it it does feel like it's (35:18 - 35:23)
it's smoothed out like I did a handful (35:20 - 35:25)
of raids before I I went to bed last (35:23 - 35:27)
night and they all ran relatively smooth (35:25 - 35:30)
like besides the whole like wait two (35:27 - 35:31)
seconds for your move to hit but (35:30 - 35:33)
obviously the game's trying to calculate (35:31 - 35:35)
everyone at once and (35:33 - 35:38)
who knows but that's (35:35 - 35:40)
seeing things in raids are good (35:38 - 35:42)
the other thing I don't know if it's (35:40 - 35:44)
don't know if it's fixed don't know if (35:42 - 35:45)
it was intentional (35:44 - 35:47)
um we knew that there were five new (35:45 - 35:49)
marks ribbons whatever you want to call (35:47 - 35:51)
them marks and ribbons one was the item (35:49 - 35:54)
finder uh it was told to us that it was (35:51 - 35:56)
broken (35:54 - 35:58)
um and it magically magically worked (35:56 - 36:00)
when the DLC came out (35:58 - 36:02)
we could speculate for the next hour (36:00 - 36:04)
whether it was broken or whether they (36:02 - 36:06)
were just going to turn it on for the (36:04 - 36:08)
DLC (36:06 - 36:09)
um obviously there's a lot of items in (36:08 - 36:11)
the game that don't get turned on until (36:09 - 36:15)
the DLC uh (36:11 - 36:17)
if you want me to speculate I feel like (36:15 - 36:18)
they were just saving it to turn it on (36:17 - 36:20)
it's called the item finder mark it is (36:18 - 36:23)
when you use the let's go feature and (36:20 - 36:24)
you send your Pokemon out to pick up an (36:23 - 36:26)
item there's a one in a hundred chance (36:24 - 36:28)
that you get the mark on your Pokemon so (36:26 - 36:30)
you can earn it on any Pokemon the (36:28 - 36:32)
reason I I kind of think that like they (36:30 - 36:34)
were just saving it for the DLC (36:32 - 36:36)
is number one there's still another one (36:34 - 36:38)
that doesn't work which I'm assuming (36:36 - 36:40)
will come out with the next DLC and (36:38 - 36:42)
number two is if you've explored the DLC (36:40 - 36:44)
for 10 minutes (36:42 - 36:46)
you will quickly realize there are items (36:44 - 36:48)
everywhere (36:46 - 36:52)
somebody broke a pinata over kitakami (36:48 - 36:55)
and and it is littered (36:52 - 36:58)
like you cannot go two feet without (36:55 - 37:00)
something shining in the Grass at you (36:58 - 37:04)
and I'm like leave me alone I just want (37:00 - 37:06)
to move (37:04 - 37:08)
I kind of like it because it does remind (37:06 - 37:11)
me of Isle of armor in front under where (37:08 - 37:13)
like I I feel rewarded for walking (37:11 - 37:15)
around I'm like even when I'm done (37:13 - 37:17)
picking up items I'm like oh what was I (37:15 - 37:19)
doing and then I was like ah it doesn't (37:17 - 37:20)
matter there's more items over here I'll (37:19 - 37:23)
just go over here (37:20 - 37:23)
um so yeah uh there's a brand new Mark (37:25 - 37:28)
whether or not you thought it was broken (37:27 - 37:30)
it's working now it works great I've (37:28 - 37:33)
gotten it on like 10 Pokemon so (37:30 - 37:35)
sometimes it takes an hour sometimes it (37:33 - 37:40)
takes 10 minutes it's all RNG baby RNG (37:35 - 37:40)
um (37:41 - 37:44)
so they added that uh I don't use the (37:41 - 37:47)
lock on feature apparently that's fixed (37:44 - 37:49)
I didn't know it was broken I don't use (37:47 - 37:51)
it but people were saying that the L (37:49 - 37:53)
button they fixed that did they (37:51 - 37:56)
okay that's I I heard a lot of people (37:53 - 37:58)
very excited that they fixed it I I (37:56 - 38:01)
don't use it at all so I I didn't know (37:58 - 38:03)
how bad it was my staff using it didn't (38:01 - 38:04)
work (38:03 - 38:06)
like I don't know yeah like why is it (38:04 - 38:07)
it's like what I did (38:06 - 38:10)
is it took me years to understand that (38:07 - 38:13)
sword dance was fixed because it was it (38:10 - 38:16)
never worked in gen 1 so I was convinced (38:13 - 38:19)
like well these are just broken useless (38:16 - 38:21)
moves and it took like three generations (38:19 - 38:25)
to be like oh no they work properly now (38:21 - 38:25)
um yeah so the lock-on thing apparently (38:26 - 38:32)
works I cannot tell you what I I just (38:28 - 38:33)
know it was bad (38:32 - 38:34)
um but people were saying it works now (38:33 - 38:36)
so that's cool (38:34 - 38:39)
uh what else did they fix I pretty much (38:36 - 38:40)
everything I'm saying you don't need to (38:39 - 38:42)
pay for the DLC like you can if you (38:40 - 38:44)
didn't buy the DLC you can still get the (38:42 - 38:47)
item finder Mark in it works in paldaya (38:44 - 38:49)
you can pick up items in paldea it will (38:47 - 38:51)
it will work fine (38:49 - 38:54)
um there's probably a couple fixes so if (38:51 - 38:56)
I remember more I'll I'll bring it up (38:54 - 38:59)
we'll move on to just features in the (38:56 - 39:00)
DLC the first one I want to talk about (38:59 - 39:02)
that I absolutely love (39:00 - 39:06)
is uh very shortly after the bus stop (39:02 - 39:08)
which is my new favorite location never (39:06 - 39:11)
leave it uh there's a care there's a (39:08 - 39:13)
character that will update your Pokedex (39:11 - 39:17)
uh or your your Rotom decks and you can (39:13 - 39:20)
change the theme of your Rotom decks (39:17 - 39:23)
which very minor very small (39:20 - 39:26)
but I love it I you go into your Pokedex (39:23 - 39:27)
a lot (39:26 - 39:28)
um (39:27 - 39:30)
and (39:28 - 39:32)
to be able to just change that color (39:30 - 39:35)
customize it is it's it's great uh like (39:32 - 39:37)
more customization good uh that (39:35 - 39:38)
character (39:37 - 39:42)
was a nice little surprise uh it made me (39:38 - 39:45)
that literal feature alone made me buy (39:42 - 39:47)
every single Rotom case in the entire (39:45 - 39:48)
game I bought them all I needed to know (39:47 - 39:51)
what they all look like the quaxley one (39:48 - 39:52)
is great (39:51 - 39:54)
um if you sync to let's go Pikachu let's (39:52 - 39:57)
go Eevee that one is great Legends is (39:54 - 39:59)
great if you forgot about those it syncs (39:57 - 40:01)
with your Rotom phone case it's the (39:59 - 40:06)
region that syncs with your decks yep (40:01 - 40:06)
but there's there's a lot there's a lot (40:09 - 40:13)
more (40:12 - 40:17)
customization available in in your decks (40:13 - 40:19)
not your not your character there's not (40:17 - 40:21)
a lot of more clothing no no there's (40:19 - 40:22)
nothing (40:21 - 40:26)
there's some more hairstyles (40:22 - 40:26)
and they added more (40:27 - 40:34)
variety of hairstyles to meet a a bigger (40:30 - 40:38)
demographic which is always appreciated (40:34 - 40:38)
um (40:38 - 40:40)
you know Steve's running around with the (40:38 - 40:42)
Moon breeda Final Fantasy 14 hairstyle (40:40 - 40:46)
yeah yes (40:42 - 40:46)
um (40:49 - 40:52)
they did they did actually add more (40:50 - 40:54)
clothing though uh they added like a (40:52 - 40:56)
grievered beanie they added the beanie (40:54 - 40:58)
for that the professor wears in Legends (40:56 - 41:01)
Arceus if so at a certain point you'll (40:58 - 41:02)
get what's called (41:01 - 41:03)
um (41:02 - 41:06)
like the teal ticket I think just a (41:03 - 41:08)
character gives it to you like it's like (41:06 - 41:10)
it's really really early on you get the (41:08 - 41:12)
ticket I think it's when you get the the (41:10 - 41:13)
DLC (41:12 - 41:15)
outfit I was that called Hannah the (41:13 - 41:17)
outfit your characters wearing I don't (41:15 - 41:20)
remember sorry I expected you to know (41:17 - 41:22)
you are my Japanese expert I don't wanna (41:20 - 41:25)
I don't want to name it wrong it's not a (41:22 - 41:28)
kyoma spell it I can say it (41:25 - 41:30)
oh I can't I I don't remember what's (41:28 - 41:32)
called the the little Japanese outfit (41:30 - 41:33)
they were at the festival (41:32 - 41:34)
um I can't remember what it's called you (41:33 - 41:36)
when you get that outfit for the first (41:34 - 41:38)
time you get the little ticket (41:36 - 41:39)
um so the ticket gives you more (41:38 - 41:42)
hairstyles and then if you go back to (41:39 - 41:44)
paldea stores will have updated (41:42 - 41:49)
inventory new shoes new socks new hats (41:44 - 41:52)
probably new glasses (41:49 - 41:55)
um the DLC has its own little store with (41:52 - 41:58)
the masks and stuff (41:55 - 42:00)
but I don't think you can access most of (41:58 - 42:03)
that until you beat this story (42:00 - 42:04)
um (42:03 - 42:06)
but that's not like a surprise you see (42:04 - 42:08)
the mask so you know you know that (42:06 - 42:09)
you'll be able to wear the masks (42:08 - 42:12)
eventually yeah yeah so there are also (42:09 - 42:14)
new stools for when you're picnicking (42:12 - 42:17)
there are news tools (42:14 - 42:17)
they they have updated the picnic stuff (42:21 - 42:28)
uh that's true now that this stuff you (42:25 - 42:29)
have to spend the forty dollars for you (42:28 - 42:32)
just can't go back to paldaya and just (42:29 - 42:34)
be like I want the new like hats like it (42:32 - 42:37)
is part of the 40 is it 35 or is it 40 I (42:34 - 42:39)
just keep saying 40 because tax makes it (42:37 - 42:40)
40. (42:39 - 42:43)
it's it's like (42:40 - 42:45)
I think it's 35 so yeah I think that's (42:43 - 42:46)
right (42:45 - 42:47)
um (42:46 - 42:49)
uh so yeah there's that character (42:47 - 42:52)
there's the the picnic people I (42:49 - 42:54)
completely forgot about the picnic (42:52 - 42:55)
people I put a lot of effort into (42:54 - 42:58)
collecting all of the picnics (42:55 - 43:01)
the tablecloths in the main game and so (42:58 - 43:04)
when I went and got all the stools they (43:01 - 43:07)
just it kept going it was all the stools (43:04 - 43:10)
me Mom I was like oh you you have two (43:07 - 43:12)
yeah I don't care about picnics (43:10 - 43:14)
all right well here's your stool uh I (43:12 - 43:17)
would maybe care about picnics if they (43:14 - 43:18)
didn't look (43:17 - 43:20)
so pixelated (43:18 - 43:23)
it doesn't look real great when you go (43:20 - 43:24)
in (43:23 - 43:25)
um (43:24 - 43:27)
what else a lot of items on the ground (43:25 - 43:29)
we talked about the ATMs oh the other (43:27 - 43:33)
change okay so going back to you don't (43:29 - 43:35)
have to spend money (43:33 - 43:38)
they fixed a lot of the outbreak stuff (43:35 - 43:40)
and when I say fixed again I don't know (43:38 - 43:44)
if it was intentional or not but if you (43:40 - 43:47)
are listening to this podcast and you (43:44 - 43:50)
maybe played two or three times a week I (43:47 - 43:54)
promise you that that every single (43:50 - 43:55)
outbreak you saw (43:54 - 43:59)
every day was probably like flittle (43:55 - 44:03)
weasel and like frost last and then like (43:59 - 44:06)
you would be so lucky if you didn't see (44:03 - 44:08)
flittle but you were probably seeing (44:06 - 44:11)
flittle like every day in outbreaks (44:08 - 44:13)
I haven't seen a flittle since the (44:11 - 44:17)
update I have seen so many new outbreaks (44:13 - 44:20)
in both pal well obviously in in kidkami (44:17 - 44:21)
I see a bunch of new outbreaks because (44:20 - 44:23)
they're all new Pokemon but in paldea (44:21 - 44:26)
I've seen scatterbuck never seen a (44:23 - 44:28)
Scatterbug so Larvesta never saw (44:26 - 44:30)
Larvesta (44:28 - 44:32)
um what else did I see that was really (44:30 - 44:36)
cool I saw hariyama don't eat hariyama (44:32 - 44:37)
it was really cool to see a Hari on my (44:36 - 44:39)
outbreak though (44:37 - 44:41)
um (44:39 - 44:45)
they must have changed the the (44:41 - 44:48)
percentage that these raids pop up (44:45 - 44:50)
and which like makes sense like whether (44:48 - 44:53)
or not it was like broken or this is (44:50 - 44:54)
intentional like the game's eight months (44:53 - 44:57)
old it so it just breathed breath (44:54 - 45:01)
breathes braved uh it just pushed in a (44:57 - 45:03)
breath of fresh air (45:01 - 45:08)
into those outbreaks uh again I I saw a (45:03 - 45:10)
Cycles all raid I the outbreak I've (45:08 - 45:13)
never I know they existed I know other (45:10 - 45:14)
people have gotten them I've played this (45:13 - 45:17)
game like every day for the last eight (45:14 - 45:20)
months I've never seen one so (45:17 - 45:22)
um again you don't need to spend the 40 (45:20 - 45:25)
for that if if (45:22 - 45:27)
you know you one of the reasons you put (45:25 - 45:29)
the game down is because you got a (45:27 - 45:32)
little outbreak every day (45:29 - 45:34)
you missed your shot you'll never see (45:32 - 45:36)
one again (45:34 - 45:38)
you're gonna be so excited when you (45:36 - 45:42)
finally see a fiddle because it's gone (45:38 - 45:42)
um so yeah that that is different (45:42 - 45:48)
apparently uh (45:45 - 45:50)
apparently if you go out down into area (45:48 - 45:52)
zero (45:50 - 45:53)
um (45:52 - 45:55)
there was something where like roaring (45:53 - 45:58)
moon or flutter Maine didn't spawn based (45:55 - 46:01)
off sandwiches because of something now (45:58 - 46:02)
they do (46:01 - 46:05)
that actually sounded broken it was very (46:02 - 46:07)
broken I tried to catch so many flutter (46:05 - 46:09)
Maine for people and it was always a (46:07 - 46:11)
slog (46:09 - 46:14)
yeah so (46:11 - 46:16)
um that that sounded like an actual (46:14 - 46:18)
issue that they fixed so that's great (46:16 - 46:20)
there was another issue we only know (46:18 - 46:22)
this because of Anubis (46:20 - 46:25)
where uh (46:22 - 46:29)
uh the antique synasty would not spawn (46:25 - 46:34)
in a three level three sandwich outbreak (46:29 - 46:36)
but if you did a level one or two it (46:34 - 46:39)
would spawn but that wasn't as good (46:36 - 46:41)
because obviously you want level three (46:39 - 46:44)
and they're reporting that is fixed so (46:41 - 46:47)
if you do a level three antique synasty (46:44 - 46:50)
it will work properly (46:47 - 46:54)
um probably just related to The General (46:50 - 46:54)
outbreaks seem good finally (46:54 - 46:59)
but (46:58 - 47:03)
uh yeah so don't need don't need the (46:59 - 47:05)
forty dollars to have good outbreaks (47:03 - 47:09)
great like like uh there's a lot of good (47:05 - 47:11)
changes here without spending money yeah (47:09 - 47:15)
and and you can get you should see raids (47:11 - 47:17)
from people putting them up (47:15 - 47:19)
from from (47:17 - 47:22)
the DLC (47:19 - 47:25)
yep yeah so they they added the the Kid (47:22 - 47:27)
Academy Pokedex should be about a (47:25 - 47:31)
hundred uh the Pokedex itself is 200 (47:27 - 47:33)
total (47:31 - 47:34)
um there's not that many new Pokemon (47:33 - 47:36)
obviously there's the loyal three (47:34 - 47:38)
there's ogre Pawn there's a couple (47:36 - 47:39)
others (47:38 - 47:42)
um but there is there's 90s (47:39 - 47:45)
something returning Pokemon (47:42 - 47:47)
and then (47:45 - 47:49)
you know if you completed your scarlet (47:47 - 47:51)
and violet decks you should go into the (47:49 - 47:53)
DLC with anywhere between 100 to maybe (47:51 - 47:56)
like 103 I think and the only reason 103 (47:53 - 47:59)
would exist is because basket Legion is (47:56 - 48:01)
a Pokemon and then like carbank like (47:59 - 48:03)
those were Pokemon you could technically (48:01 - 48:04)
move in (48:03 - 48:06)
in the last like month because they (48:04 - 48:08)
updated the game so you got like 100 (48:06 - 48:10)
Pokemon to catch now (48:08 - 48:13)
you could just connect a Pokemon home (48:10 - 48:14)
and move them all over and be like well (48:13 - 48:16)
I got nothing to do (48:14 - 48:20)
you're right you you you you did that (48:16 - 48:21)
yourself (48:20 - 48:24)
and by all means if that's what you (48:21 - 48:26)
wanted to do cool I enjoy catching (48:24 - 48:28)
Pokemon I enjoy filling out my decks I (48:26 - 48:29)
don't think I think Greg has talked (48:28 - 48:31)
about maybe he doesn't care about (48:29 - 48:34)
catching Pokemon again I like it I mean (48:31 - 48:36)
I caught them all but it was easier than (48:34 - 48:37)
whatever (48:36 - 48:39)
because my home is disorganized mess I'm (48:37 - 48:41)
like I don't care (48:39 - 48:44)
so you just thought about them (48:41 - 48:46)
yeah although I like that I will say (48:44 - 48:47)
this (48:46 - 48:51)
I did run into the you're stuck at 199 (48:47 - 48:53)
out of 200. (48:51 - 48:56)
well I didn't hear about this (48:53 - 48:56)
you have to catch a white stripe (48:57 - 49:01)
masculine (48:59 - 49:01)
oh was that your last one oh (49:02 - 49:06)
because it will Mark basculine as (49:05 - 49:10)
complete but to complete the Pokedex you (49:06 - 49:12)
have to have caught a white stripe (49:10 - 49:14)
masculine because I caught everything (49:12 - 49:19)
else and I'm like it's complete I have (49:14 - 49:22)
nothing left uh and then I came across a (49:19 - 49:24)
white stripe and I'm like (49:22 - 49:26)
you can't be serious and they were (49:24 - 49:27)
serious (49:26 - 49:29)
that's that's amazing my last Pokemon (49:27 - 49:33)
was Duskull because the game for the the (49:29 - 49:36)
DLC will force you into time zones until (49:33 - 49:41)
you complete it so I was in like the (49:36 - 49:43)
morning for almost the entire (49:41 - 49:45)
playthrough because I just wasn't (49:43 - 49:47)
progressing the DLC I was just like I'm (49:45 - 49:49)
just gonna catch everything it does go (49:47 - 49:51)
only appears at night so that was like (49:49 - 49:52)
my literally my last one so as soon as (49:51 - 49:55)
the game was like okay now it's night (49:52 - 49:56)
time I was like I gotta go find this (49:55 - 49:59)
video they're pretty easy to find would (49:56 - 50:00)
you know where to look yeah once (49:59 - 50:02)
nighttime happens (50:00 - 50:05)
um Hannah how did you like your uh Dex (50:02 - 50:06)
collecting experience I'm still not (50:05 - 50:08)
quite done yet but I am enjoying it I (50:06 - 50:10)
have been using the new and improved (50:08 - 50:12)
lock-on feature quite a bit (50:10 - 50:15)
it works (50:12 - 50:18)
I don't know I am enjoying having more (50:15 - 50:21)
things to work on in the game again (50:18 - 50:24)
I don't set that many independent goals (50:21 - 50:27)
I don't shiny hunt I don't Mark hunt I'm (50:24 - 50:28)
enjoying having a pokedex to complete (50:27 - 50:31)
again so I will I will there's two (50:28 - 50:33)
things I have to say about the region (50:31 - 50:37)
one it is as blind as I figured it was (50:33 - 50:41)
going to be from the preview it is just (50:37 - 50:44)
paldea with some rice fields (50:41 - 50:46)
um there's a giant okay there's only one (50:44 - 50:48)
right there's a giant ugly mountain in (50:46 - 50:49)
the middle that looks like a lump of (50:48 - 50:50)
clay (50:49 - 50:54)
the thing that actually made me (50:50 - 50:57)
want to explore it is they did the caves (50:54 - 51:00)
so much better in this DLC like running (50:57 - 51:03)
into a hoot hoot cave running into a (51:00 - 51:06)
mammo swine cave or a swine up cave like (51:03 - 51:09)
that's kind of exciting like I found a (51:06 - 51:12)
colony and now I'm gonna raid your (51:09 - 51:14)
Colony for each and every one of you (51:12 - 51:17)
those do exist in paudia too there are (51:14 - 51:19)
just fewer of them and they're harder to (51:17 - 51:22)
find right and they're just broken (51:19 - 51:23)
they're just straight up broken (51:22 - 51:25)
sometimes (51:23 - 51:27)
um I thought that I liked the fact that (51:25 - 51:30)
it is it it is smaller it doesn't look (51:27 - 51:32)
any particularly better it doesn't look (51:30 - 51:35)
like a particularly new exciting region (51:32 - 51:37)
it you know you come up from a bus stop (51:35 - 51:38)
there's some rice fields and then it's (51:37 - 51:41)
pale and there's a once again a Giant (51:38 - 51:43)
Mountain in the middle for no real good (51:41 - 51:45)
reason and it looks like a weird lump of (51:43 - 51:47)
clay (51:45 - 51:47)
um (51:49 - 51:53)
look I I the hoot hoot cave was my one (51:50 - 51:56)
of my favorite sports games I like the (51:53 - 51:58)
hoodoo cave it's it's great if you have (51:56 - 51:59)
not found the who hoot cave I hope you (51:58 - 52:02)
do find on the Geodude (51:59 - 52:04)
that's exciting but that's not like it (52:02 - 52:06)
was for no so you know going back to (52:04 - 52:08)
Center days (52:06 - 52:11)
that sounds that sounds bad (52:08 - 52:12)
um (52:11 - 52:17)
uh what else okay so Pokedex uh (52:12 - 52:19)
uh is (52:17 - 52:21)
I yeah so I heard people were getting (52:19 - 52:24)
stuck at 199 but that was because one (52:21 - 52:26)
Pokemon is hide hidden behind a little (52:24 - 52:28)
Side Story (52:26 - 52:30)
um which (52:28 - 52:32)
I don't think we need to spoil that for (52:30 - 52:33)
this episode I think we could save that (52:32 - 52:35)
but that Side Story I think is great I (52:33 - 52:39)
do I do like that science story it it is (52:35 - 52:40)
making me question how they're (52:39 - 52:43)
classifying certain things I'm like we (52:40 - 52:45)
really need to sort of look at what (52:43 - 52:46)
regions are (52:45 - 52:49)
and what these games are but it is that (52:46 - 52:52)
that is a fun little storyline and I I (52:49 - 52:54)
and I enjoyed (52:52 - 52:56)
that storyline (52:54 - 52:58)
okay so there are two Side Stories (52:56 - 53:01)
there's one there's the one that gives (52:58 - 53:03)
you a Pokemon and then there's one with (53:01 - 53:04)
two rich people that you meet very early (53:03 - 53:07)
I adore and I want to be them I want to (53:04 - 53:09)
follow them I want to know everything (53:07 - 53:11)
about their lives I want a reality show (53:09 - 53:15)
about them they are such terrible awful (53:11 - 53:17)
people that I am fasted into every (53:15 - 53:19)
aspect of their life and I want their (53:17 - 53:22)
outfits we I want their hairstyles (53:19 - 53:24)
everything I want to know everything (53:22 - 53:27)
about these two jerks (53:24 - 53:29)
yeah so so we won't go in depth of those (53:27 - 53:33)
two Side Stories but we will I will I (53:29 - 53:35)
will just in case I don't know if we're (53:33 - 53:37)
gonna go full story right now but we'll (53:35 - 53:38)
do the like (53:37 - 53:41)
hey after this part we gave you your (53:38 - 53:42)
warning (53:41 - 53:45)
um but there is a Pokemon behind one of (53:42 - 53:46)
those two Side Stories so if you're (53:45 - 53:48)
missing a Pokemon go do that the one (53:46 - 53:50)
thing I will say about that is people (53:48 - 53:52)
are always like I wish they would add (53:50 - 53:54)
more stories to like legendaries or (53:52 - 53:56)
mythicals they always say like back like (53:54 - 53:59)
when they did in Gen 5 which I was (53:56 - 54:01)
around during Gen 5 (53:59 - 54:05)
taking a single boat to an island and (54:01 - 54:07)
walking straight into a tower where (54:05 - 54:10)
Victini is is not a Side Story like it's (54:07 - 54:12)
I mean kind of that's just a short story (54:10 - 54:14)
it's like it's a very short story (54:12 - 54:16)
there's nothing there there's no there's (54:14 - 54:18)
no one to battle yeah there is there's a (54:16 - 54:20)
Pokemon trapped on an island go save it (54:18 - 54:24)
that's it the story you literally you (54:20 - 54:27)
entered a a 16-digit code that gave you (54:24 - 54:30)
an in-game item for a boat ticket you (54:27 - 54:32)
take the boat to the island there is (54:30 - 54:34)
nothing there's not a single item on the (54:32 - 54:37)
idle Island to pick up there's no I (54:34 - 54:39)
think there's maybe one person person to (54:37 - 54:41)
talk to and they're like my pants fit (54:39 - 54:43)
great and then you catch Victini that's (54:41 - 54:45)
it that's the whole story story is a (54:43 - 54:47)
Nobel Prize winner like what what they (54:45 - 54:49)
did for everyone that's like I wish they (54:47 - 54:51)
used to do in jet five they did in this (54:49 - 54:54)
dlcu they did it the you talk to the (54:51 - 54:56)
person you start the mission you get the (54:54 - 54:59)
thingy thingy thing sorry (54:56 - 54:59)
and this was not they did this in I'm (55:00 - 55:03)
pretty sure there was something like (55:02 - 55:05)
this in Crown Tundra (55:03 - 55:08)
I mean there is with uh (55:05 - 55:10)
with Kelly there's with Kelly I mean you (55:08 - 55:12)

ticket like like I I was talking to (55:15 - 55:18)
people this week that didn't even know (55:16 - 55:20)
Keldeo was in the crown Tundra for (55:18 - 55:21)
everyone that's complaining again that (55:20 - 55:23)
like oh they they need to bring back (55:21 - 55:25)
stuff like gen 5. (55:23 - 55:28)
you talk to Sonia she's like follow (55:25 - 55:30)
these Footprints you gotta find three (55:28 - 55:32)
different sets of footprints then they (55:30 - 55:34)
give you the uh the swords of justice (55:32 - 55:37)
you gotta catch each one of them (55:34 - 55:39)
and then once you get all three swords (55:37 - 55:40)
of justice you can go to the little (55:39 - 55:41)
cooking I can't believe we're talking (55:40 - 55:43)
about this you go to a little cooking (55:41 - 55:46)
pot that is below the giant big pink (55:43 - 55:48)
tree (55:46 - 55:51)
so with keldia or sorry with cobalian (55:48 - 55:53)
Terrakion and Verizon in your party you (55:51 - 55:56)
do the cooking minigame doesn't matter (55:53 - 55:59)
what you cook you can fail it as long as (55:56 - 56:01)
you do it next a little fire pot and (55:59 - 56:04)
then Keldeo will spawn there (56:01 - 56:06)
and there's a whole like Sonia talks to (56:04 - 56:07)
you in between all of this stuff like (56:06 - 56:09)
every time you catch one of these things (56:07 - 56:12)

catch Keldeo it's shiny locked it's a (56:12 - 56:18)
mythical Pokemon it's it's not only is (56:14 - 56:20)
it like 18 times longer than the Victini (56:18 - 56:22)
thing there is (56:20 - 56:24)
infinite more words in the Victini thing (56:22 - 56:26)
because there's no words (56:24 - 56:28)
welcome to the boat (56:26 - 56:29)
you've made it to your destination (56:28 - 56:33)
brevity is the soul of wit (56:29 - 56:37)
um so yes they this game has uh a (56:33 - 56:39)
Pokemon with a story that's very good (56:37 - 56:41)
Quran Tundra had the same thing with (56:39 - 56:45)
Keldeo spoiler the the DLC is not killed (56:41 - 56:48)
is not here yet (56:45 - 56:48)
um (56:49 - 56:54)
uh so yeah that's that stuff exists uh (56:50 - 56:58)
uh I guess let's I can't think of (56:54 - 57:00)
um other talking points right now let me (56:58 - 57:01)
look at my notes but as I'm thinking of (57:00 - 57:03)
that let's let's just get the story (57:01 - 57:04)
stuff out of the way spoiler we're (57:03 - 57:06)
starting the story (57:04 - 57:08)
turn away now (57:06 - 57:10)
foreign (57:08 - 57:12)
I do have more stuff but that's all (57:10 - 57:14)
right it's story time uh Hannah said (57:12 - 57:17)
let's start with Hannah uh because you (57:14 - 57:19)
said you liked it uh we didn't really (57:17 - 57:21)
get your thoughts or Impressions with (57:19 - 57:23)
scarlet and violet because we had Greg (57:21 - 57:25)
and Al and then you came on and then (57:23 - 57:28)
will left to the shadow realm (57:25 - 57:31)
um but you said you liked it so uh the (57:28 - 57:34)
the floor is yours I liked it primarily (57:31 - 57:36)
because there was more to do with the (57:34 - 57:39)
paladea story than I was expecting so I (57:36 - 57:43)
did enjoy the kitikami story as a story (57:39 - 57:46)
I have some of the same qualms that I'm (57:43 - 57:48)
sure Greg will bring up (57:46 - 57:50)
um but (57:48 - 57:54)
they started off with a new character (57:50 - 57:57)
who we had seen in the trailers (57:54 - 57:59)
um who started talking about the Scarlet (57:57 - 58:01)
book and the Violet book and (57:59 - 58:03)
we get to learn a little bit more about (58:01 - 58:06)
that and it's just at the beginning and (58:03 - 58:07)
at the end with a little bit in the (58:06 - 58:08)
middle (58:07 - 58:11)
but it's starting to make it sound like (58:08 - 58:14)
the theories I am excited about are (58:11 - 58:16)
going to come to fruition in the last (58:14 - 58:19)
DLC so there was a whole lot more there (58:16 - 58:22)
in this DLC than I was expecting I was (58:19 - 58:24)
expecting nothing and when this started (58:22 - 58:28)
out by talking about the books they got (58:24 - 58:31)
excited they laid groundwork I honestly (58:28 - 58:33)
wish I could have just hung out with (58:31 - 58:37)
Breyer the entire time and told (58:33 - 58:40)
everybody else to go jump in the lake I (58:37 - 58:42)
would have I would have rather have (58:40 - 58:46)
spent my entire time with the puking kid (58:42 - 58:46)
give me the puking kid and I would have (58:46 - 58:52)
been happy (58:51 - 58:54)
that was that actually that's a good (58:52 - 58:55)
two-sidetracked that's one of my (58:54 - 58:58)
complaints is they pair you with Randy (58:55 - 59:02)
useless characters but I still prefer (58:58 - 59:04)
the I would still prefer the puking kid (59:02 - 59:06)
over the the brother and sister when (59:04 - 59:08)
that story (59:06 - 59:10)
again I'm sorry I'm getting sidetracked (59:08 - 59:12)
they the the I was hoping something (59:10 - 59:14)
would happen with these three useless (59:12 - 59:16)
characters but nothing dude they don't (59:14 - 59:18)
even attend there's a point where like (59:16 - 59:20)
everyone is in the town to like meet (59:18 - 59:22)
ogrepon and they don't even show up to (59:20 - 59:25)
that they're they're nowhere they they (59:22 - 59:27)
could have (59:25 - 59:27)
the other part that I really like is the (59:38 - 59:44)
clearly doesn't care Pocus and her (59:42 - 59:46)
worker who just spends her entire time (59:44 - 59:50)
on the phone and cannot be oh she cannot (59:46 - 59:52)
be bothered Millennial Nurse Joy is (59:50 - 59:55)
again yeah what do you want (59:52 - 59:59)
I'm swiping just put him in the thing (59:55 - 60:02)
she's like swiping on she's like healing (59:59 - 60:04)
your Pokemon as soon as they're she's (60:02 - 60:07)
like I'm back to Snapchat she is she is (60:04 - 60:08)
done here (60:07 - 60:10)
she's awesome (60:08 - 60:13)
um they could have like there was Martin (60:10 - 60:15)
and sorok and sword and shield had more (60:13 - 60:17)
personality and character than the three (60:15 - 60:20)
people they stuck with you like they (60:17 - 60:22)
could have put like nimona doesn't have (60:20 - 60:25)
to be there but like there are like (60:22 - 60:27)
there are literally anyone else could (60:25 - 60:30)
have been there and been a better one (60:27 - 60:31)
kid who was supposed to be stuck with (60:30 - 60:33)
Carmine did have valid complaints (60:31 - 60:35)
throughout the entire time every time (60:33 - 60:38)
you talk to him yeah (60:35 - 60:42)
yeah uh okay so my question Hannah is (60:38 - 60:44)
you said they laid groundwork it was (60:42 - 60:46)
more than you expected leading theories (60:44 - 60:49)
like what what stood out to you Theory (60:46 - 60:52)
wise that the lake like the lake the (60:49 - 60:55)
lake oh the lake the lake so the lake (60:52 - 60:58)
that has the Terra crystals that do (60:55 - 61:01)
something that is not past and future as (60:58 - 61:03)
well as the fact that the music is the (61:01 - 61:05)
same music that is in area zero if (61:03 - 61:07)
you're there for long enough this whole (61:05 - 61:08)
singing starts up and that was super (61:07 - 61:12)
exciting but oh I didn't get that I (61:08 - 61:15)
wasn't there you have to be there yeah (61:12 - 61:15)
but it's it's very exciting the theory (61:15 - 61:20)
that I'm excited about is that uh past (61:18 - 61:22)
and future is not actually what these (61:20 - 61:25)
crystals do and this leads towards that (61:22 - 61:27)
being maybe right (61:25 - 61:30)
yeah oh okay it is I will say this I (61:27 - 61:32)
agree with Hannah it is (61:30 - 61:35)
much more (61:32 - 61:37)
they seem to at least in some way be (61:35 - 61:40)
pointing towards dimensional and not (61:37 - 61:41)
past and future which is a much more (61:40 - 61:45)
exciting thing uh who knows again they (61:41 - 61:48)
lay a lot of theory ground work that (61:45 - 61:49)
they (61:48 - 61:51)
do not follow up on but they're (61:49 - 61:54)
following it this time yeah we said that (61:51 - 61:56)
about Legends Arceus and at the end (61:54 - 61:59)
you're like they went or not Naf (61:56 - 62:02)
whatever we're done bye I think that I (61:59 - 62:05)
think the reason I like this DLC and I (62:02 - 62:07)
know maybe this is why Greg doesn't is (62:05 - 62:09)
the DLC literally (62:07 - 62:13)
ends with it to be continued that's not (62:09 - 62:14)
why I don't like it I'm fine with the (62:13 - 62:17)
Doobie continue dude (62:14 - 62:17)
oh sure sure and we can get to those (62:19 - 62:23)
characters but I really did like that (62:21 - 62:25)
the DLC was just like a big old to be (62:23 - 62:28)
continued I really liked it I I think (62:25 - 62:30)
with the Isle of armor there's there's (62:28 - 62:32)
no story there really um there's a lot (62:30 - 62:34)
of lore there's a and it's good lore (62:32 - 62:36)
like knowing that mustard was like (62:34 - 62:39)
Leon's teacher and the like the Honeys (62:36 - 62:41)
like the lore in Isle of armor is good (62:39 - 62:44)
the story non-existent but that's fine (62:41 - 62:48)
uh like it was fine the the story in the (62:44 - 62:53)
crown Tundra was fine uh I I like the (62:48 - 62:55)
characters in this DLC more (62:53 - 62:58)
um uh but I I was thinking about peony (62:55 - 63:01)
and I don't remember her name uh (62:58 - 63:03)
peonya (63:01 - 63:05)
um I I just didn't like relate to those (63:03 - 63:07)
characters at all it like it was funny (63:05 - 63:09)
when cataracts like took control of (63:07 - 63:11)
peony like that was like very humorous (63:09 - 63:13)
but like (63:11 - 63:14)
I don't even remember what happens at (63:13 - 63:16)
the end there besides like you pick a (63:14 - 63:19)
horse that was cool (63:16 - 63:21)
um the little rabbit rides the horse (63:19 - 63:24)
also cool and then like this is actually (63:21 - 63:26)
a story (63:24 - 63:29)
yeah I mean the CR they had completed (63:26 - 63:31)
the story really a sword and shield like (63:29 - 63:34)
and there wasn't much more to tell other (63:31 - 63:35)
than what the other regions were doing (63:34 - 63:37)
and like there is a story in Crown (63:35 - 63:39)
Tundra of solving Mysteries and you do (63:37 - 63:41)
solve the Mysteries like that's what's (63:39 - 63:43)
the Mysteries that they're like a lot of (63:41 - 63:44)
little like what's the mysteries of the (63:43 - 63:46)
contender and you know here's Rose's (63:44 - 63:47)
hotter younger brother running around (63:46 - 63:50)
and his daughter doesn't like him (63:47 - 63:53)
um and it was really like the contender (63:50 - 63:56)
story was really to explain why all the (63:53 - 63:57)
legendaries in the ultra beasts are here (63:56 - 64:00)
like it was an excuse there was like a (63:57 - 64:03)
lore excuse to put them there which I at (64:00 - 64:04)
least appreciate the thought of putting (64:03 - 64:07)
there but it's not a deep story this (64:04 - 64:11)
also this DLC is not a deep story (64:07 - 64:12)
um but the characters are actually (64:11 - 64:14)
characters (64:12 - 64:17)
I know you don't like them I'm not (64:14 - 64:18)
saying they're good but they're (64:17 - 64:21)
characters they actually have (64:18 - 64:22)
personalities (64:21 - 64:26)
and wrestling they make characters that (64:22 - 64:28)
you're supposed to purposely hate and I (64:26 - 64:30)
feel like they did that here like you (64:28 - 64:32)
are supposed to (64:30 - 64:35)
oh this is my uh you guys can correct me (64:32 - 64:37)
if I'm wrong but I think what what my (64:35 - 64:38)
takeaway from it was you were supposed (64:37 - 64:39)
to like (64:38 - 64:43)
Kiki I don't remember she just calls him (64:39 - 64:45)
Kira and you're supposed to like Kieran (64:43 - 64:47)
and then hate Carmine and then at the (64:45 - 64:50)
end of it it's supposed to switch (64:47 - 64:52)
I I think that was their goal I think (64:50 - 64:54)
that is the tropes that they were trying (64:52 - 64:58)
to play with and I would argue they (64:54 - 65:00)
failed (64:58 - 65:04)
so spectacularly because (65:00 - 65:04)
nothing angers me more in a story when (65:06 - 65:12)
me as a main character are purposely (65:09 - 65:15)
written to be mentally and emotionally (65:12 - 65:19)
unintelligent and I am forced to (65:15 - 65:22)
participate in abuse and bullying that I (65:19 - 65:26)
cannot make any active (65:22 - 65:30)
actions to either opt out of it (65:26 - 65:33)
or change it (65:30 - 65:36)
and when she is called to the carpet for (65:33 - 65:38)
it she says the one thing that made me (65:36 - 65:42)
put the thing down and walk away was I (65:38 - 65:47)
am being kind I didn't hit him and I'm (65:42 - 65:51)
like are you kid you are emotionally and (65:47 - 65:52)
psychologically abusive when you're (65:51 - 65:54)
called to the carpet your defense is (65:52 - 65:56)
that you didn't physically hit a person (65:54 - 65:58)
and that we're supposed to be okay with (65:56 - 66:01)
this I am not okay with this I'm not (65:58 - 66:03)
okay that you forced me to lie to this (66:01 - 66:05)
person I am not okay that you force me (66:03 - 66:10)
into actions that make me participate in (66:05 - 66:12)
the actual bullying of an actual (66:10 - 66:14)
character that I'm never allowed to make (66:12 - 66:16)
a meaningful change to and then I have (66:14 - 66:19)
to continue this in the next storyline (66:16 - 66:22)
no this is inappropriate (66:19 - 66:24)
I don't care that I'm supposed to hate (66:22 - 66:27)
them when you have in your main (66:24 - 66:29)
storyline a story about the damage that (66:27 - 66:31)
bullying does and then you force me to (66:29 - 66:35)
participate in bullying in your DLC (66:31 - 66:37)
absolutely not (66:35 - 66:39)
that is unacceptable I liked it (66:37 - 66:42)
I loved it I thought it was great I (66:39 - 66:44)
hated Carmine and had to kind of pretend (66:42 - 66:48)
I wasn't the one going along with it (66:44 - 66:50)
it was I don't think it's I don't think (66:48 - 66:53)
it's that different from n (66:50 - 66:56)
and what you know you what getsis does (66:53 - 66:57)
to end I don't think it's that different (66:56 - 67:00)
from what lusamine does to correct but (66:57 - 67:03)
you are participating in both of those (67:00 - 67:04)
situations too and you don't have a (67:03 - 67:06)
choice with Lily you are building Lily (67:04 - 67:08)
up you are building Lily and you are (67:06 - 67:10)
changing her to become her own person (67:08 - 67:13)
you have an effect to build her and get (67:10 - 67:16)
her out of that relationship and the (67:13 - 67:18)
same with n and she still chooses to (67:16 - 67:19)
stay (67:18 - 67:21)
she walks away she leaves she goes to (67:19 - 67:24)
Kanto she she says her goodbyes she does (67:21 - 67:26)
what she needs to do to advertise and (67:24 - 67:29)
then she leaves and also does the same (67:26 - 67:32)
thing and realizes his mistake realizes (67:29 - 67:34)
that he's been manipulated and also (67:32 - 67:37)
chooses to walk away now they may (67:34 - 67:40)
attempt to fix this but neither in (67:37 - 67:41)
neither case (67:40 - 67:45)
are you directly having to side with the (67:41 - 67:48)
abuser you do not ever side with guesses (67:45 - 67:51)
and you never asked you never go on the (67:48 - 67:54)
side of lucid and you are forced to go (67:51 - 67:57)
on the side of Carmine and you are (67:54 - 67:59)
forced to be with her and you are forced (67:57 - 68:01)
to follow her (67:59 - 68:03)
I think there's a big difference between (68:01 - 68:06)
lusamine and getsis and you are talking (68:03 - 68:08)
about two adults and then an actual (68:06 - 68:13)
child and I think I think Carmine and (68:08 - 68:15)
Kiki's relationship (68:13 - 68:19)
is so this is why I liked it it's so (68:15 - 68:24)
relatable to me and my siblings (68:19 - 68:30)
like the little things that she says (68:24 - 68:32)
um or the little things that he says (68:30 - 68:35)
they set each other off and if you're an (68:32 - 68:36)
outsider you're like that wasn't really (68:35 - 68:39)
that big of a deal but also I've been in (68:36 - 68:41)
that situation and like I can see why (68:39 - 68:43)
like there's a point where she's like (68:41 - 68:45)
hey just go find something to do and (68:43 - 68:48)
he's like yeah okay whatever and she (68:45 - 68:51)
gets mad and and like I 100 relate to (68:48 - 68:53)
that like why she got mad but also I 100 (68:51 - 68:57)
relate to a car or Kiki being like yeah (68:53 - 68:58)
whatever like it's not that big of a (68:57 - 69:00)
deal like yeah whatever but like I see (68:58 - 69:03)
why both got mad in that situation and (69:00 - 69:06)
that dialogue is like the entire story (69:03 - 69:09)
and I like loved that because I can (69:06 - 69:11)
relate to that so much because I have of (69:09 - 69:13)
course I understand that Dynamic I've (69:11 - 69:18)
lived in that dynamic as well I think (69:13 - 69:18)
so when Carmine is like I I I yeah I (69:18 - 69:24)
yelled at him I didn't hit him like (69:21 - 69:27)
like that that has happened so much in (69:24 - 69:29)
my household and that's still not a good (69:27 - 69:30)
thing that's not a good thing no it's (69:29 - 69:32)
not a good thing but it's the story (69:30 - 69:33)
they're trying to tell and it's like (69:32 - 69:35)
relatable of like I remember when I was (69:33 - 69:37)
like 15 and I said the same thing to my (69:35 - 69:39)
parents like I didn't hit Sabrina I just (69:37 - 69:41)
yelled at her and it was like but Carmen (69:39 - 69:42)
my parents would be like stand in the (69:41 - 69:45)
corner but Karma's just a bully but (69:42 - 69:47)
currently and also when she says he (69:45 - 69:48)
didn't hit him the grandfather just (69:47 - 69:50)
drops it like yeah I guess you're right (69:48 - 69:52)
but anyways let's talk about the mask (69:50 - 69:55)
it's like she's never held by any adult (69:52 - 69:57)
to any standard (69:55 - 70:01)
that would say hey you're this behavior (69:57 - 70:05)
is beyond the pale like you are yeah and (70:01 - 70:06)
I think I think I think there's going to (70:05 - 70:08)
be a payoff the story is only like two (70:06 - 70:10)
hours long like like I feel like (70:08 - 70:13)
everything in the story was just set up (70:10 - 70:16)
maybe I I'm I don't know like as (70:13 - 70:17)
somebody who watches wrestling and (70:16 - 70:19)
you're like you hate this person you (70:17 - 70:20)
literally have to wait like two years (70:19 - 70:22)
before the payoff comes of like okay now (70:20 - 70:24)
I actually like the like the pain it was (70:22 - 70:26)
worth it like all of this drama was (70:24 - 70:28)
worth it for like the story I don't (70:26 - 70:30)
expect to like Carmine I am hoping to (70:28 - 70:31)
see Kieran (70:30 - 70:34)
be okay (70:31 - 70:37)
I mean also like this is it's also (70:34 - 70:39)
really really heavily trophy like we we (70:37 - 70:42)
just I also just completed this exact (70:39 - 70:45)
storyline in Pokemon Masters like I'm (70:42 - 70:49)
just like I'm over this idea I'm over (70:45 - 70:51)
people (70:49 - 70:53)
being horrible and you're not allowed to (70:51 - 70:55)
do anything about it and you're not all (70:53 - 70:57)
and they're not really held responsible (70:55 - 71:00)
and that a payoff hopefully will be (70:57 - 71:03)
coming I don't have faith that it will (71:00 - 71:05)
um I don't I don't think you two are the (71:03 - 71:06)
type of people that are like I missed (71:05 - 71:09)
the mean rivals or whatever uh but we (71:06 - 71:12)
know they exist and so if you if you (71:09 - 71:15)
miss somebody being mean (71:12 - 71:18)
here they are the the here's your main (71:15 - 71:19)
character that they haven't done enough (71:18 - 71:21)
well they did do I think uh what's his (71:19 - 71:24)
name and bead yeah I mean sword and (71:21 - 71:27)
shield right yeah straight up as a jerk (71:24 - 71:30)
Arvin starts out a little bit yeah Aaron (71:27 - 71:33)
said it starts out as a jerk but oh yeah (71:30 - 71:34)
that's true (71:33 - 71:35)
um (71:34 - 71:38)
you know even even gladion wasn't that (71:35 - 71:42)
mean or rude compared to (71:38 - 71:46)
um bead uh or Carmine uh there's a point (71:42 - 71:48)
where I don't know if it was a (71:46 - 71:51)
coincidence do you guys know the Arthur (71:48 - 71:53)
meme where Arthur clenches his fist (71:51 - 71:56)
uh-huh Carmen does it and they zoom in (71:53 - 71:58)
on it (71:56 - 72:00)
and I think (71:58 - 72:02)
somebody at game freak must have watched (72:00 - 72:05)
Arthur uh but that was like for me that (72:02 - 72:07)
was like a little like a funny but also (72:05 - 72:09)
cool moment of like showing (72:07 - 72:14)
like a deeper anger that (72:09 - 72:17)
I will say the emotions shown on the (72:14 - 72:19)
characters their faces throughout the (72:17 - 72:21)
whole thing they had (72:19 - 72:23)
good it was good Expressions it was good (72:21 - 72:26)
visual storytelling (72:23 - 72:28)
when Greg was like I I don't like when (72:26 - 72:31)
the game forces you to lie (72:28 - 72:33)
um (72:31 - 72:33)
I got to that part because like I I saw (72:34 - 72:38)
Greg tweet that before I knew what was (72:36 - 72:39)
going to happen because I was stuck at (72:38 - 72:42)
the bus stop for like three days uh I (72:39 - 72:43)
did a lot of me too raids after the (72:42 - 72:45)
deals he came out (72:43 - 72:46)
um (72:45 - 72:48)
uh I was like oh yeah this does suck (72:46 - 72:50)
but then I didn't know that (72:48 - 72:54)
Carmen was going to turn (72:50 - 72:58)
um so like even even at the end I was (72:54 - 73:00)
like okay well we we caught ogre Pawn (72:58 - 73:03)
everything's okay and he was he was more (73:00 - 73:05)
not okay and then that said to be (73:03 - 73:09)
continued and I was like okay like the (73:05 - 73:13)
lie that I was forced to tell tell like (73:09 - 73:14)
I I thought I didn't think we were gonna (73:13 - 73:16)
get to be continued I thought like (73:14 - 73:19)
this this lie why did I have to lie to (73:16 - 73:21)
them to have a payoff and it was like oh (73:19 - 73:24)
there is no payoff yet like (73:21 - 73:26)
we are we are not done with this story (73:24 - 73:28)
at all and that's that is why I liked it (73:26 - 73:30)
I totally see why somebody would not (73:28 - 73:33)
like that and if if the story just ended (73:30 - 73:35)
there of like you caught ogrepon (73:33 - 73:37)
everyone's happy now but I get it like (73:35 - 73:40)
he liked ogre Pond you got to keep him (73:37 - 73:42)
he was being very childish and I think (73:40 - 73:44)
at one point he says I know I'm being (73:42 - 73:45)
really selfish but it should be my (73:44 - 73:47)
Pokemon not not yours (73:45 - 73:50)
um and then he was even more Angry after (73:47 - 73:52)
you beat him again and then it said to (73:50 - 73:54)
be continued I was like I is this the (73:52 - 73:56)
first time a side character has been (73:54 - 73:58)
frustrated that the main character gets (73:56 - 74:00)
the legendary (73:58 - 74:03)
I mean in in the in these games yes in (74:00 - 74:06)
in Masters no like they literally just (74:03 - 74:10)
did this they literally just did this (74:06 - 74:10)
um (74:11 - 74:16)
but also I was like take it take it just (74:12 - 74:19)
take it like seriously (74:16 - 74:19)
I want this weird Cape thing in a diaper (74:22 - 74:27)
I don't you don't like ogrepon she's (74:24 - 74:31)
great what (74:27 - 74:31)
holy cow I love I I went from not caring (74:31 - 74:36)
about ogre pond at all at all until like (74:34 - 74:38)
she like danced into the festival and (74:36 - 74:40)
like walked around I don't know like I (74:38 - 74:42)
love this thing I was like all you had (74:40 - 74:44)
to make her do was like dance and I was (74:42 - 74:46)
like I I think she's immediately like I (74:44 - 74:48)
think she's such a cool Pokemon (74:46 - 74:50)
I like the mask test rationalization (74:48 - 74:53)
effect I think that's really cool but I (74:50 - 74:55)
look at it and I'm like take the take (74:53 - 74:57)
the cape off get out of the weird diaper (74:55 - 74:59)
like what is going on you're an (74:57 - 75:01)
amorphous blob that I only care about (74:59 - 75:03)
the masks on (75:01 - 75:06)
I love auger pond (75:03 - 75:08)
um (75:06 - 75:08)
I I I think the twist of the loyal three (75:09 - 75:14)
actually being bad was like (75:12 - 75:17)
twist it was it was like super (75:14 - 75:19)
surprising (75:17 - 75:21)
um if they had had platforms that (75:19 - 75:23)
actually looked like the masks and those (75:21 - 75:26)
had been the the forms that we had seen (75:23 - 75:28)
leading up to this if we if they had (75:26 - 75:31)
looked like good Pokemon instead of (75:28 - 75:33)
looked like evil Pokemon (75:31 - 75:35)
here's like well yeah I mean in (75:33 - 75:37)
retrospect you go oh the three Pokemon (75:35 - 75:39)
that are mainly poisonous types are the (75:37 - 75:41)
evil ones sick oh okay I'm dumb I should (75:39 - 75:43)
have realized that right now also I feel (75:41 - 75:45)
like the whole like oh we can't tell the (75:43 - 75:47)
we can't tell everybody I'm like (75:45 - 75:48)
literally if I walked in there and just (75:47 - 75:51)
said hey the ogre's actually a Pokemon (75:48 - 75:53)
everybody would be like oh okay that (75:51 - 75:56)
makes sense sure like that is not a (75:53 - 75:58)
different conversation to have in a (75:56 - 76:00)
world that has legendary Pokemon and (75:58 - 76:02)
Pokemon running around uh the Catholic (76:00 - 76:05)
Oh it's a Pokemon oh cool cool it (76:02 - 76:07)
reminded awesome it reminded me of the (76:05 - 76:09)
episode of The Simpsons where Lisa (76:07 - 76:12)
discovers that Jebediah Springfield is (76:09 - 76:13)
actually like a bad pirate but (76:12 - 76:15)
everyone's like celebrating Jebediah day (76:13 - 76:17)
and she wants to tell everyone and then (76:15 - 76:19)
the the one person is like nah they (76:17 - 76:22)
can't handle the truth which is like (76:19 - 76:24)
whatever I I don't know where that Trope (76:22 - 76:26)
originally came from it's like I mean (76:24 - 76:29)
just so that she she ends up she ends up (76:26 - 76:30)
not telling them and they all just (76:29 - 76:33)
celebrate Jebediah day anyways and it's (76:30 - 76:35)
like it's not the you know he's he (76:33 - 76:37)
brings happiness even though he's a bad (76:35 - 76:39)
whatever it was like that that's a weird (76:37 - 76:42)
episode of The Simpsons uh (76:39 - 76:44)
I think though like the other part of (76:42 - 76:47)
why I like the story is it felt like (76:44 - 76:49)
things made sense (76:47 - 76:51)
so like here's a good example of that (76:49 - 76:53)
would be like why did they suddenly (76:51 - 76:55)
become totem Pokemon and they like (76:53 - 76:58)
explain it like they they ran to the old (76:55 - 76:59)
guy and they're like did you see them (76:58 - 77:00)
and they were like yeah they came and we (76:59 - 77:02)
gave them all this food and they're like (77:00 - 77:04)
you fed them like they literally (77:02 - 77:05)
answered the question of why they were (77:04 - 77:07)
total Pokemon and a bunch of people in (77:05 - 77:08)
my chat were like why are they taught a (77:07 - 77:10)
Pokemon it was like do you guys not read (77:08 - 77:13)
like I will say all it took was like one (77:10 - 77:14)
line (77:13 - 77:18)
I will admit like I like the I like the (77:14 - 77:21)
three I like I again like being (77:18 - 77:24)
resurrected through anger again like it (77:21 - 77:27)
was a really really trophy storyline and (77:24 - 77:28)
at that point it was sort of really over (77:27 - 77:30)
the whole thing yeah that was like the (77:28 - 77:32)
one thing they didn't kind of explained (77:30 - 77:34)
but I thought it was probably obvious (77:32 - 77:36)
that like they Rose from the grave (77:34 - 77:40)
because of the toxicity slash anger of (77:36 - 77:42)
Kieran Kiki yeah (77:40 - 77:44)
um which is also a whole different super (77:42 - 77:47)
problematic thing but whatever (77:44 - 77:49)
um I was so over it at that point and (77:47 - 77:51)
realized like we're just we're just (77:49 - 77:52)
doing this and I just have to go through (77:51 - 77:54)
this as fast as I possibly can just to (77:52 - 77:56)
be out of it (77:54 - 77:57)
um (77:56 - 78:00)
so like I will say this they gave actual (77:57 - 78:03)
reasons they gave actual through lines (78:00 - 78:05)
that made sense (78:03 - 78:08)
um like (78:05 - 78:08)
they wrote (78:08 - 78:14)
a story that is cohesive which I cannot (78:10 - 78:18)
say about every Pokemon game yes it's a (78:14 - 78:19)
whole lot better than starting to talk (78:18 - 78:22)
about X and Y like they wrote why is (78:19 - 78:26)
there a very tall three thousand Road (78:22 - 78:26)
um (78:26 - 78:29)
that I'm not that excited to continue (78:27 - 78:31)
also I was surprised that the blueberry (78:29 - 78:36)
Academy is in Unova I was like hey we (78:31 - 78:37)
didn't talk about that it's a region (78:36 - 78:38)
that exists (78:37 - 78:42)
so for the last two years of this game (78:38 - 78:45)
coming out people were like Spain is (78:42 - 78:48)
right next to France and kallus is right (78:45 - 78:49)
there and even when you start the game (78:48 - 78:51)
there's like an area that's connected (78:49 - 78:56)
and not only do we not go to Kalos the (78:51 - 78:58)
first DLC is set in Japan they don't say (78:56 - 79:01)
where if it's close to Sinnoh or Holland (78:58 - 79:03)
or whatever right we literally go to as (79:01 - 79:06)
far as way as possible and then the (79:03 - 79:09)
second DLC they just straight up say yep (79:06 - 79:11)
it's connected to you Nova yep neither (79:09 - 79:14)
of these places (79:11 - 79:14)
um (79:18 - 79:24)
the I don't know what they're doing with (79:19 - 79:27)
Breyer Greg said like I would rather (79:24 - 79:30)
doing research papers I don't understand (79:27 - 79:34)
I don't fully understand her her (79:30 - 79:36)
character (79:34 - 79:38)
um like obviously she's a professor (79:36 - 79:42)
obviously she's from Unova she brought (79:38 - 79:47)
so Carmen and Carmine and Kieran Kieran (79:42 - 79:50)
go to the blueberry Academy but they're (79:47 - 79:52)
from katakami so that that all that all (79:50 - 79:55)
makes sense like that I get that (79:52 - 79:57)
um so obviously there's students there (79:55 - 80:00)
and then she is The Chaperone who does a (79:57 - 80:03)
very bad job at chaperoning everyone (80:00 - 80:05)
but like and then she knows about the (80:03 - 80:06)
books and she knows about the lake it's (80:05 - 80:09)
not just knows about she is she is (80:06 - 80:11)
descendant of Heath who wrote the book (80:09 - 80:13)
who wrote the book (80:11 - 80:16)
oh throughout the book she's also (80:13 - 80:18)
curious one (80:16 - 80:21)
about (80:18 - 80:23)
tracelization being able to be moved (80:21 - 80:25)
through other places in the world and (80:23 - 80:27)
the fact that it exists in Palo Duro but (80:25 - 80:30)
it also exists here because of the lake (80:27 - 80:32)
and the crystals up up top that seems to (80:30 - 80:35)
stabilize the phenomenon (80:32 - 80:38)
she is investigating that and why that (80:35 - 80:39)
is a thing (80:38 - 80:42)
and it is based out of the completed (80:39 - 80:45)
Violet book of which she has quote (80:42 - 80:47)
unquote the original copy (80:45 - 80:50)
choose to believe her because she's cool (80:47 - 80:52)
um okay (80:50 - 80:53)
definitely she's supposed to be The (80:52 - 80:55)
Descendant she has got the completed (80:53 - 80:58)
book and she's trying to understand (80:55 - 81:01)
how to rationalization spread to various (80:58 - 81:03)
places and that it seems to be able to (81:01 - 81:05)
stabilize the phenomenon for us to be (81:03 - 81:09)
able to use them in other areas do we (81:05 - 81:12)
think she's a bad guy no her eyes look (81:09 - 81:16)
like it though I don't I I think (81:12 - 81:16)
I think she is (81:17 - 81:27)
along the lines of a of a Kukui sort of (81:21 - 81:29)
I want to bring these things to other (81:27 - 81:31)
areas and expand out (81:29 - 81:35)
of that guy but also kind of tied to (81:31 - 81:37)
that as I don't really care how we get (81:35 - 81:40)
there I think there is an element of the (81:37 - 81:43)
end will justify the means with her (81:40 - 81:47)
um that we don't know again I would have (81:43 - 81:50)
rather have spent my entire time getting (81:47 - 81:52)
to know hurt or motivations and studying (81:50 - 81:54)
with her this entire thing and I'm (81:52 - 81:56)
really hoping that I can just choose to (81:54 - 81:59)
be with her at the blueberry Academy and (81:56 - 82:01)
those who can fall off into the ocean (81:59 - 82:04)
and drown I don't care it's more likely (82:01 - 82:05)
the two storylines are going to come (82:04 - 82:08)
together into one (82:05 - 82:08)
um (82:08 - 82:12)
for the record I don't think we're (82:10 - 82:16)
actually going into Unova no no uh (82:12 - 82:18)
I I think that like what what is what is (82:16 - 82:20)
uh New York has like a couple Islands I (82:18 - 82:22)
would assume that the blueberry (82:20 - 82:23)
academies (82:22 - 82:27)
Staten Island that is enclosed (82:23 - 82:29)
it could be anything it doesn't really (82:27 - 82:32)
matter all of all of this geography is (82:29 - 82:35)
already it's made up water Giant (82:32 - 82:37)
floating boarding Academy it's there (82:35 - 82:40)
it's there it's right it isn't (82:37 - 82:41)
isn't Galler like just technically (82:40 - 82:44)
upside down technically yeah I mean it's (82:41 - 82:46)
weird or like the crown Tundra is also (82:44 - 82:48)
just like upside down Ireland or (82:46 - 82:50)
something like that or not not Crown (82:48 - 82:52)
Tundra Isle of armor (82:50 - 82:54)
um and it doesn't matter I just don't (82:52 - 82:56)
think we're like walking into castellia (82:54 - 82:59)
city is what I'm saying no (82:56 - 83:02)
like the walking in castalia City I need (82:59 - 83:05)
them cones baby it's been so long I know (83:02 - 83:08)
so uh I believe people were saying that (83:05 - 83:13)
kitakami is about 25 the size of paldea (83:08 - 83:16)
which feels right like one-fourth of it (83:13 - 83:21)
uh maybe 26 who knows so if we're gonna (83:16 - 83:26)
just assume that uh the biome is (83:21 - 83:27)
probably the same size (83:26 - 83:31)
uh that would make sense but I don't (83:27 - 83:32)
remember seeing a bunch of big buildings (83:31 - 83:36)
or whatever in the biome so I would (83:32 - 83:37)
guess or (83:36 - 83:40)
that the academy or there is a city (83:37 - 83:43)
above the biome or below that you take (83:40 - 83:47)
an elevator into because (83:43 - 83:52)
the second DLC seems very very battle (83:47 - 83:53)
focused (83:52 - 83:55)
um it they they talk about how the (83:53 - 83:57)
blueberry Academy is this great battling (83:55 - 84:00)
League there is an actual Elite Four (83:57 - 84:01)
this is not like a they said this (84:00 - 84:04)
they're yep there's an elite four in the (84:01 - 84:06)
second one I'm assuming there's going to (84:04 - 84:08)
be some battle tree or battle tower (84:06 - 84:12)
since that was cut or not cut but that (84:08 - 84:14)
doesn't exist and gosh I can't remember (84:12 - 84:17)
a Pokemon game without a tower of (84:14 - 84:19)
battling uh what whatever they decide to (84:17 - 84:20)
call it you know (84:19 - 84:22)
um so I'm assuming that's going to come (84:20 - 84:24)
back whether that's more advanced like a (84:22 - 84:26)
Battle Frontier or something who knows (84:24 - 84:29)
but (84:26 - 84:31)
uh I'm I'm assuming there will be (84:29 - 84:33)
something where multiple battles exist (84:31 - 84:36)
and this seems very flipped from Isle of (84:33 - 84:37)
armor and Crown Thunder where they (84:36 - 84:39)
decide to do the battling stuff up front (84:37 - 84:42)
also fun fact didn't apparently a lot of (84:39 - 84:44)
people didn't know this there is a whole (84:42 - 84:47)
battle section in the dojo (84:44 - 84:50)
for Isle of armor where there are 18 (84:47 - 84:53)
very unique very specific battles of (84:50 - 84:57)
every type against mustard and they can (84:53 - 84:58)
be pretty tough I mean it kind of (84:57 - 85:01)
depends on RNG because his Pokemon do (84:58 - 85:02)
change (85:01 - 85:03)
um but you're like forced to be like you (85:02 - 85:06)
bring three bugs and then mustard brings (85:03 - 85:07)
whatever he wants and sometimes he (85:06 - 85:09)
brings three fire Pokemon against your (85:07 - 85:11)
three bugs and that's a that's a loser (85:09 - 85:12)
battle you just gotta go in again and (85:11 - 85:15)
and hope that so if you do all all of (85:12 - 85:16)
those battles you get like a exclusive (85:15 - 85:18)
it's not that great you just get a shirt (85:16 - 85:20)
that you can't get anywhere else (85:18 - 85:23)
um but that was like a lot of content (85:20 - 85:24)
like obviously if you don't like (85:23 - 85:27)
battling that's not for you but (85:24 - 85:29)
the biggest complaint (85:27 - 85:35)
of this DLC is it's too short which (85:29 - 85:37)
is kind of the worst complaint you can (85:35 - 85:40)
have because if it was bad you wouldn't (85:37 - 85:43)
care you're like oh it's bad who cares (85:40 - 85:44)
if it's short I'm done I'm already done (85:43 - 85:45)
with it like I only played an hour I (85:44 - 85:47)
didn't like it I'm moving on (85:45 - 85:50)
um I think that's my main complaint is I (85:47 - 85:53)
liked it so much I wanted to do more and (85:50 - 85:54)
there's (85:53 - 85:55)
there's not a lot (85:54 - 85:58)
I mean there is like I like I I put like (85:55 - 85:59)
15 hours into it like I played it a lot (85:58 - 86:01)
this weekend (85:59 - 86:02)
um and I I mean I played more than 15 (86:01 - 86:05)
hours but some of that was Mewtwo some (86:02 - 86:07)
of that was old stuff uh but you know (86:05 - 86:10)
completed the Pokedex did one of the two (86:07 - 86:14)
side quests did the main story did a (86:10 - 86:16)
bunch of raids uh I did two new (86:14 - 86:18)
outbreaks (86:16 - 86:21)
um I got a bunch of uh marks on my (86:18 - 86:24)
Pokemon with the new Mark like I I feel (86:21 - 86:26)
like I got my money's worth I could (86:24 - 86:28)
easily see (86:26 - 86:30)
somebody just doing the main story using (86:28 - 86:32)
their Pokemon home to connect and been (86:30 - 86:35)
like I'm kind of done and I totally get (86:32 - 86:36)
that (86:35 - 86:37)
um (86:36 - 86:39)
but (86:37 - 86:41)
I think I I think it's a little too (86:39 - 86:44)
short I think uh if there was (86:41 - 86:48)
one other thing but I don't know what (86:44 - 86:50)
that would be that isn't battling (86:48 - 86:51)
because they're they're saving all the (86:50 - 86:53)
battling for them so there's there are (86:51 - 86:55)
hidden like you can you have to like (86:53 - 86:58)
there's the ogre Clan to deal with like (86:55 - 87:01)
there are little I didn't finish things (86:58 - 87:03)
you know there's the greatest golden (87:01 - 87:05)
couple in the world that you have to (87:03 - 87:10)
deal with there's there's the one side (87:05 - 87:12)
mission to get the Pokemon like there (87:10 - 87:15)
are little things (87:12 - 87:16)
um but again I think they are leaning (87:15 - 87:20)
heavily on the exploration to carry the (87:16 - 87:22)
bulk of what you want to do here and if (87:20 - 87:24)
you don't like doing that (87:22 - 87:27)
um there's not a lot to do (87:24 - 87:27)
um (87:27 - 87:30)
so (87:27 - 87:30)
I mean I have to agree with you like if (87:32 - 87:36)
you don't like scarlet and violet this (87:34 - 87:40)
is not this is not making yeah (87:36 - 87:40)
um because it did I was really hoping it (87:40 - 87:44)
would maybe somehow turn a corner for me (87:42 - 87:47)
and it just it just doesn't it just it's (87:44 - 87:48)
like (87:47 - 87:51)
you gave me an offensive story that's (87:48 - 87:53)
short blissfully short that I could get (87:51 - 87:54)
out of it fast (87:53 - 87:56)
um you have a weird mini game that I (87:54 - 87:57)
guess you can play with multiple people (87:56 - 87:59)
for (87:57 - 88:01)
which is cool (87:59 - 88:03)
um there's another million dollar prize (88:01 - 88:05)
for reasons (88:03 - 88:08)
that is the best I guess I guess we we (88:05 - 88:10)
said spoilers off limit there's a (88:08 - 88:12)
there's a million dollar outfit it is (88:10 - 88:15)
the best outfit in this entire series it (88:12 - 88:17)
it looks good (88:15 - 88:19)
um it feels like you can accessorize it (88:17 - 88:22)
a little bit better it is not all purple (88:19 - 88:24)
it is not all orange (88:22 - 88:28)
it actually looks good in the lighting (88:24 - 88:29)
um (88:28 - 88:31)
it's it's the best outfit they've done (88:29 - 88:34)
so far uh (88:31 - 88:36)
that's still you know what would have (88:34 - 88:37)
changed (88:36 - 88:40)
actual outfits like I feel like people (88:37 - 88:44)
like I I think of like (88:40 - 88:44)
I I think (88:45 - 88:48)
I think of (88:48 - 88:52)
um (88:50 - 88:53)
I think I said this like two weeks ago (88:52 - 88:55)
that like (88:53 - 88:57)
I encourage Pokemon fans to play other (88:55 - 88:59)
games I think we were talking about (88:57 - 89:02)
raids for that instance of like how the (88:59 - 89:04)
intent for raids are they're supposed to (89:02 - 89:06)
be multiplayer can you do the stuff (89:04 - 89:09)
single player sure but the intent is (89:06 - 89:10)
you're supposed to be playing with other (89:09 - 89:13)
people and this is you know other games (89:10 - 89:15)
do this other games have like the intent (89:13 - 89:17)
here is multiplayer the intent here is (89:15 - 89:19)
single player and sometimes I feel like (89:17 - 89:22)
Pokemon fans get stuck in like I'm not (89:19 - 89:23)
used to this (89:22 - 89:25)
it's okay (89:23 - 89:29)
um and so like I do think about (89:25 - 89:31)
I didn't like scarlet and violet I wish (89:29 - 89:34)
I'd liked it what could they do to get (89:31 - 89:36)
me to come back in my review that I like (89:34 - 89:39)
posted that is very short is hey if you (89:36 - 89:41)
didn't like Scarlet Violet this DLC is (89:39 - 89:43)
not going to convince you and then but (89:41 - 89:44)
then I think like (89:43 - 89:47)
Are there games out there where the DLC (89:44 - 89:49)
did convince slash change and bring (89:47 - 89:52)
people back and I do think there are I I (89:49 - 89:54)
think there's a handful of that but I I (89:52 - 89:58)
do think that is incredibly rare where a (89:54 - 90:02)
DLC is so good that it brings people (89:58 - 90:03)
back but (90:02 - 90:05)
I think at the core that's all that's (90:03 - 90:07)
what people the the developers want (90:05 - 90:08)
right they know that people bought their (90:07 - 90:09)
game and they want to make a good (90:08 - 90:12)
product to bring people back to it (90:09 - 90:14)
um I think no man's sky is a weird (90:12 - 90:17)
example yeah because they they just kept (90:14 - 90:19)
updating it they didn't actually Force (90:17 - 90:22)
anyone to pay but they did it right they (90:19 - 90:24)
they launched with a very very bad game (90:22 - 90:28)
it sold incredibly well I bought two (90:24 - 90:31)
copies because I'm dumb and and (90:28 - 90:34)
uh I I sold both of them before they (90:31 - 90:36)
fixed it but anytime you talk to (90:34 - 90:38)
somebody with no man's Sky I guarantee (90:36 - 90:40)
you the first thing they say is oh it's (90:38 - 90:42)
so much better now like they they did do (90:40 - 90:44)
the work (90:42 - 90:46)
to bring people back (90:44 - 90:49)
um I think the work that the Poke that (90:46 - 90:51)
game freak could have done is fix the (90:49 - 90:52)
frame rate (90:51 - 90:56)
uh address a lot of the bugs and to (90:52 - 90:59)
their credit they did address so that (90:56 - 91:01)
outbreaks uh the boxes (90:59 - 91:03)
um the the other thing we mentioned that (91:01 - 91:04)
I can't remember (91:03 - 91:07)
um they did address some of the bugs but (91:04 - 91:09)
I think frame rate (91:07 - 91:11)
the graphics but that's like a huge (91:09 - 91:15)
stretch uh but that's not there yet so (91:11 - 91:17)
like if one of your complaints is like (91:15 - 91:20)
the game runs like garbage (91:17 - 91:24)
DLC didn't change that right like (91:20 - 91:27)
if if you're not super interested in (91:24 - 91:30)
catching Pokemon DLC is not for you if (91:27 - 91:32)
you're not really heavy on the story DLC (91:30 - 91:35)
is not for you if (91:32 - 91:37)
you only care about the new Pokemon (91:35 - 91:41)
there's not a lot there are only a few (91:37 - 91:44)
uh like the mini game is cool (91:41 - 91:47)
um the new raids are fun but again you (91:44 - 91:50)
have to like raids and some people just (91:47 - 91:52)
don't like raids that's fine like I get (91:50 - 91:53)
I get I totally get why people don't (91:52 - 91:54)
like raids (91:53 - 91:57)
um like the Moshi that they introduced I (91:54 - 92:00)
actually don't love I don't like when (91:57 - 92:03)
the Pokemon I don't like when game freak (92:00 - 92:06)
introduces new items that are just the (92:03 - 92:08)
same item I could not figure out why (92:06 - 92:11)
these were I could not I still cannot (92:08 - 92:13)
figure out why they're being added like (92:11 - 92:15)
what are you doing the only one that (92:13 - 92:17)
makes sense is the one that resets your (92:15 - 92:19)
IDs that one makes complete sense it's (92:17 - 92:23)
brand new item it's great but like (92:19 - 92:25)
we have so those that don't know Moshi (92:23 - 92:27)
gives you the Moshi that you earn from (92:25 - 92:28)
ogre (92:27 - 92:31)
ousting (92:28 - 92:31)
gives you 10 EVS per Moshi so 10 HP 10 (92:31 - 92:38)
attack whatever one it whatever color is (92:36 - 92:40)
what this already exists they're just (92:38 - 92:42)
vitamins (92:40 - 92:45)
yeah and the vitamins give you 10. now (92:42 - 92:46)
there's a different thing that are (92:45 - 92:49)
called feathers and Feathers give you (92:46 - 92:53)
one so this is helpful if you have (92:49 - 92:56)
something that's like 152 that is 15 (92:53 - 92:58)
vitamins and then two feathers like (92:56 - 93:01)
that's and all of this stuff needs to be (92:58 - 93:03)
divisible by four (93:01 - 93:05)
that's why um (93:03 - 93:09)
170 doesn't work 160 does 180 does 170 (93:05 - 93:10)
does not that's why you need the (93:09 - 93:12)
feathers to tweak it this is all just (93:10 - 93:15)
for competitive people so like (93:12 - 93:18)
why is Moshi 10 why would it not be like (93:15 - 93:20)
even if it was four that would be like (93:18 - 93:23)
okay I see what you're doing what or if (93:20 - 93:24)
it was 20. okay I could see what you're (93:23 - 93:26)
doing but like (93:24 - 93:28)
the the argument against me was like (93:26 - 93:29)
well I have to buy vitamins I don't have (93:28 - 93:31)
to buy this yeah I mean like yeah I (93:29 - 93:33)
guess but you don't have to that's the (93:31 - 93:35)
one argument for them but at that point (93:33 - 93:38)
just but there's only one minigame can (93:35 - 93:42)
have them just be vitamins like adding (93:38 - 93:45)
another item right yeah let's have them (93:42 - 93:48)
reward you vitamins like having them (93:45 - 93:49)
when I looked at it I'm like oh what do (93:48 - 93:51)
these two I'm like oh these are just (93:49 - 93:54)
free vitamins but (93:51 - 93:57)
they made them a different item which (93:54 - 94:00)
now clogs up my screen (93:57 - 94:03)
more for no good reason it's so (94:00 - 94:06)
confusing for no good reason it's like (94:03 - 94:09)
at this point get rid of rare candy we (94:06 - 94:12)
don't need it anymore like you have like (94:09 - 94:13)
why (94:12 - 94:15)
like yeah somebody's gonna be like well (94:13 - 94:17)
experience candy is only like x amount (94:15 - 94:20)
of experience yeah I know I get it but (94:17 - 94:21)
also just get rid of her candy it's not (94:20 - 94:24)
that it's it's not that deep like the (94:21 - 94:26)
fact that we have like C incense and (94:24 - 94:29)
Mystic water and water plate they all do (94:26 - 94:30)
the same thing it's all just twenty (94:29 - 94:33)
percent water thing the instances are (94:30 - 94:34)
supposed to be useful in breeding but (94:33 - 94:37)
again sure yes like we don't need an (94:34 - 94:40)
item that does that either we could just (94:37 - 94:44)
have baby Pokemon appear without having (94:40 - 94:47)
to jump through 14 loops and different (94:44 - 94:50)
ways to make it up like come on (94:47 - 94:53)
you could maybe argue in like a (94:50 - 94:55)
competitive sense where you're limited (94:53 - 94:56)
one item per you could be like well I (94:55 - 94:59)
need I need wave incense on them and (94:56 - 95:00)
then I need Mystic water on them and if (94:59 - 95:02)
they were the same item I could only (95:00 - 95:03)
like (95:02 - 95:06)
yeah I guess (95:03 - 95:08)
but there are so many other items to use (95:06 - 95:11)
like I don't think in the history of (95:08 - 95:13)
competitive there has been a big Mystic (95:11 - 95:15)
water I think there's ever been a team (95:13 - 95:17)
that needed both I don't think that's a (95:15 - 95:21)
thing like that could be a thing one day (95:17 - 95:24)
I don't I just don't love let's add more (95:21 - 95:28)
items that do the same thing like I (95:24 - 95:30)
don't see how that benefits anyone in (95:28 - 95:32)
the player base like if anything I I (95:30 - 95:34)
think of the average Pokemon player (95:32 - 95:36)
being like there's so much stuff I don't (95:34 - 95:38)
know what it does (95:36 - 95:42)
there is there like like they're oh more (95:38 - 95:44)
quality of life changes uh you can sort (95:42 - 95:49)
the TM stuff by learnable only for your (95:44 - 95:50)
Pokemon you do not need to pay the 40 (95:49 - 95:53)
for that that's great see I'm talking (95:50 - 95:54)
about all these like quality of life (95:53 - 95:58)
changes but they're just not enough (95:54 - 96:01)
I don't think to bring somebody back and (95:58 - 96:04)
I hope that the second DLC is that I (96:01 - 96:06)
hope that like the second DLC like if (96:04 - 96:10)
the second DLC is as short as this will (96:06 - 96:12)
I be happy personally yeah I like (96:10 - 96:15)
Pokemon and I do like scarlet and violet (96:12 - 96:17)
um minus all the issues I do like the (96:15 - 96:18)
games I don't think they're the best (96:17 - 96:21)
Pokemon games but they're fun but I (96:18 - 96:22)
don't think (96:21 - 96:25)
that that would be satisfactory like (96:22 - 96:29)
this second DLC almost has to be double (96:25 - 96:33)
this DLC to make it feel (96:29 - 96:35)
valuable (96:33 - 96:37)
this DLC is just (96:35 - 96:41)
a little shallow yeah (96:37 - 96:43)
it is I don't expect any more from the (96:41 - 96:46)
next one I don't either I expect them to (96:43 - 96:48)
finish up scarlet and violet in a way (96:46 - 96:49)
that I'm probably gonna be happy with (96:48 - 96:52)
but but but even even going to what you (96:49 - 96:54)
said Hannah which made me more excited (96:52 - 96:56)
for the the second part because I didn't (96:54 - 96:58)
I didn't put in correlation that the (96:56 - 97:00)
lake was the Terra Lake (96:58 - 97:01)
um (97:00 - 97:03)
and we know how can they wrap up this (97:01 - 97:05)
whole story in like another three years (97:03 - 97:09)
only took me six hours but yeah I mean (97:05 - 97:12)
that we do know that they that after the (97:09 - 97:14)
main sort of elite four events of (97:12 - 97:16)
blueberry Academy they do say we go back (97:14 - 97:19)
to area zero to continue the story so (97:16 - 97:24)
the whole is that (97:19 - 97:27)
it's a slightly longer (97:24 - 97:30)
storyline (97:27 - 97:35)
so that they can Encompass both easily (97:30 - 97:39)
um I'm at this point hoping that the (97:35 - 97:41)
Carmen and Kieran storylines 30 minutes (97:39 - 97:43)
and they both get crushed by some Crane (97:41 - 97:45)
and then we all move on happy with our (97:43 - 97:48)
lives and there would be Koreans and you (97:45 - 97:49)
know they're always building stuff (97:48 - 97:52)
always building something that is that a (97:49 - 97:54)
cotton kelder just falls out of the sky (97:52 - 97:55)
and then we can get onto things that are (97:54 - 97:57)
interesting (97:55 - 97:58)
um we do know that they are going to do (97:57 - 98:01)
an entire section that that is exploring (97:58 - 98:05)
with Breyer and the area zero stuff so I (98:01 - 98:06)
have at least they're going to do some (98:05 - 98:09)
justice to that I have less hope because (98:06 - 98:11)
they really didn't do a lot of (98:09 - 98:14)
explanation at the end of Legends Arceus (98:11 - 98:18)
that that was cohesive and coherent (98:14 - 98:20)
um Legends Arceus did some stuff better (98:18 - 98:23)
in General as well though these (98:20 - 98:25)
I like (98:23 - 98:29)
story Instagram Violet overall (98:25 - 98:29)
yeah I agree with that I think (98:29 - 98:34)
Legends kind of fell apart yeah Legends (98:32 - 98:36)
Falls real apart at the end and (98:34 - 98:39)
Pokemon has a history of falling apart (98:36 - 98:42)
at the end and just oh a ton of games I (98:39 - 98:44)
am very that's your X and Y you fall (98:42 - 98:46)
apart right at the beginning I am (98:44 - 98:49)
concerned that they won't (98:46 - 98:51)
I am hopeful that they will the fact (98:49 - 98:53)
that they brought it up in this first (98:51 - 98:56)
DLC gives me so much more hope yeah hope (98:53 - 98:59)
is a hope is easily crushed by the (98:56 - 99:00)
Pokemon (98:59 - 99:03)
I still think the second DLC (99:00 - 99:07)
comes out in November which is very soon (99:03 - 99:11)
and the reason I think that is because I (99:07 - 99:13)
don't think I think it's always been (99:11 - 99:15)
targeted towards November (99:13 - 99:17)
I think that (99:15 - 99:20)
every company whether they're video game (99:17 - 99:23)
or not wants their product to come out (99:20 - 99:25)
before Black Friday (99:23 - 99:29)
and I am sure that they have already (99:25 - 99:31)
manufactured a bunch of discs or a bunch (99:29 - 99:33)
of cartridges and a bunch of boxes like (99:31 - 99:36)
they did for the sword and shield final (99:33 - 99:37)
release which was (99:36 - 99:40)
here are both DLCs on the cartridge oh (99:37 - 99:42)
absolutely for eighty dollars and we're (99:40 - 99:44)
gonna put it in Target and that's going (99:42 - 99:46)
to sell very well because ma because (99:44 - 99:48)
whether or not like (99:46 - 99:51)
there's a reason why fortnite and Apex (99:48 - 99:54)
Legends are on the Shelf at Target it's (99:51 - 99:56)
not because they need to be they're (99:54 - 99:59)
they're free games why are they on the (99:56 - 100:01)
Shelf because like being on a shelf is (99:59 - 100:04)
incredibly important in retail and so (100:01 - 100:05)
you spend the twenty dollars you get the (100:04 - 100:07)
free game but really all you're doing is (100:05 - 100:09)
you're getting a 20 gift card grandma (100:07 - 100:12)
doesn't know how to give you a gift card (100:09 - 100:14)
for Christmas she knows how to walk into (100:12 - 100:16)
Walmart and buy something on a shelf (100:14 - 100:18)
that you asked but also and she's gonna (100:16 - 100:20)
people like giving physical things as (100:18 - 100:24)
gifts right like here's an email print (100:20 - 100:28)
out of a digital code does not make a (100:24 - 100:30)
person's heart sing if it's wrapped in (100:28 - 100:32)
like five boxes (100:30 - 100:33)
it can (100:32 - 100:37)
oh God that that are you one of those (100:33 - 100:38)
people Hannah are you one of those (100:37 - 100:42)
process of like it's in the last box at (100:38 - 100:44)
that point I'm like you know what the (100:42 - 100:46)
entire thing's going in the trash I (100:44 - 100:48)
don't care why would you do this to a (100:46 - 100:51)
person Greg's anger for the character (100:48 - 100:53)
storyline and Scarlet Violet is my anger (100:51 - 100:55)
when I have to open more than one box (100:53 - 100:57)
for a gift (100:55 - 101:01)
my family definitely definitely does it (100:57 - 101:04)
definitely a thing okay I think that (101:01 - 101:05)
basically I will say this one sorry (101:04 - 101:08)
because this still makes me laugh to (101:05 - 101:09)
this day (101:08 - 101:11)
is one Christmas there is a package that (101:09 - 101:13)
appeared under the Christmas tree that (101:11 - 101:15)
was for my mother (101:13 - 101:18)
and the person that said to Joyce from (101:15 - 101:22)
the one that loves you most (101:18 - 101:25)
all of us not my mom were trying to (101:22 - 101:27)
figure out who that was (101:25 - 101:31)
she gave it to herself (101:27 - 101:31)
oh that's pretty close (101:31 - 101:34)
Fair mom absolutely fair you drove us (101:36 - 101:41)
crazy for an entire month trying to (101:39 - 101:43)
figure out who this person was because (101:41 - 101:48)
what it wasn't my dad that was a scandal (101:43 - 101:48)
thing your mom's time she has She's (101:49 - 101:54)
Crafty (101:51 - 101:54)
I still think it I still think it's (101:54 - 101:58)
gonna come out November I I think it's (101:56 - 101:59)
probably going to come up before (101:58 - 102:02)
Thanksgiving to get yeah the week before (101:59 - 102:05)
they get the Black Friday stuff hit (102:02 - 102:07)
uh because again maybe some of you (102:05 - 102:09)
listening aren't parents or don't have (102:07 - 102:12)
kids but uh (102:09 - 102:14)
parents want to go out once during the (102:12 - 102:15)
holiday season they want to get all (102:14 - 102:17)
their shopping done they don't want to (102:15 - 102:18)
think about it again (102:17 - 102:20)
let me tell you if it's a kid wanting a (102:18 - 102:23)
Pokemon game the parents have known this (102:20 - 102:25)
kid wants the Pokemon game since (102:23 - 102:28)
December 26th they they they have known (102:25 - 102:30)
for the last year what the kid wants for (102:28 - 102:31)
Christmas they want to go out once they (102:30 - 102:35)
want to buy everything well before (102:31 - 102:37)
Christmas to get it so I think there is (102:35 - 102:40)
I I I think they're aiming for November (102:37 - 102:42)
I have no proof of that if I'm wrong (102:40 - 102:44)
cool I'll put out my LinkedIn that I was (102:42 - 102:45)
wrong that's fine (102:44 - 102:48)
um but (102:45 - 102:48)
that doesn't mean I don't think the (102:49 - 102:53)
first DLC was delayed like I still do (102:50 - 102:54)
think that that should have been like a (102:53 - 102:57)
June July release (102:54 - 102:59)
I wonder (102:57 - 103:04)
if things were cut in kitakami (102:59 - 103:06)
to like okay we got the storyline done (103:04 - 103:08)
we got everything we wanted to (103:06 - 103:09)
accomplish (103:08 - 103:11)
put it out (103:09 - 103:15)
let's focus on the the I hopefully the (103:11 - 103:18)
bigger DLC to complete the package (103:15 - 103:22)
there are things in kitakami that like I (103:18 - 103:25)
feel like something should be here like (103:22 - 103:26)
this shouldn't be a completely empty (103:25 - 103:29)
field why are there like this spot looks (103:26 - 103:31)
like a Pokemon should spawn in like a (103:29 - 103:34)
Reggie gigas or a a a request like (103:31 - 103:36)
whatever like like what it why why does (103:34 - 103:39)
this exist why are there so many like (103:36 - 103:40)
little Zelda like (103:39 - 103:43)
haha you found me like why are there so (103:40 - 103:45)
many of these in kitakami that don't do (103:43 - 103:46)
anything (103:45 - 103:48)
um (103:46 - 103:49)
so (103:48 - 103:52)
I don't know if things were cut (103:49 - 103:55)
it does seem a little empty especially (103:52 - 103:57)
compared to like compared to Crown (103:55 - 103:59)
Tundra and Isle of armor (103:57 - 104:01)
this is this is bottom like of things to (103:59 - 104:04)
do and then I would say Isle of armor (104:01 - 104:05)
would be next and then I would say Crown (104:04 - 104:09)
Tundra would be up there uh and (104:05 - 104:11)
for a game that needed more time because (104:09 - 104:13)
they delayed it why is there less things (104:11 - 104:16)
to do and if that time was spent fixing (104:13 - 104:19)
boxes fixing the the raids fixing that's (104:16 - 104:21)
fine I'm totally okay with that like (104:19 - 104:22)
people are always like do you want to (104:21 - 104:25)
see a third DLC no I want to see a face (104:22 - 104:28)
game that that I can continue playing (104:25 - 104:30)
for two more years like I don't need a (104:28 - 104:32)
third DLC with the same problems that (104:30 - 104:34)
I'm gonna like come on the show and be (104:32 - 104:35)
like yeah frame rate's still not cool (104:34 - 104:38)
we're we're going to castellia third DLC (104:35 - 104:39)
good thing everyone in the town's (104:38 - 104:41)
running at four frames a second like (104:39 - 104:42)
yeah (104:41 - 104:44)
I I don't need more robots like to all (104:42 - 104:45)
the people that are like man when are we (104:44 - 104:48)
going to back to Kalos why do you want (104:45 - 104:51)
that like why do you want Kalos at 14 (104:48 - 104:54)
frames a second don't you want like (104:51 - 104:57)
a good like good running version of (104:54 - 104:59)
Kalos don't you finally want to go back (104:57 - 105:01)
to Kalos when things are like a hundred (104:59 - 105:05)
percent working fixed they have a bunch (105:01 - 105:07)
of time like like (105:05 - 105:10)
if I have to eat my words and like there (105:07 - 105:12)
is a third DLC and we do finally go to (105:10 - 105:13)
Kalos (105:12 - 105:16)
that doesn't sound great in this current (105:13 - 105:18)
state (105:16 - 105:21)
it's hot it's hard because I think one (105:18 - 105:25)
of the more frustrating things is (105:21 - 105:30)
laugh we are well into the life cycle of (105:25 - 105:31)
this game (105:30 - 105:35)
and it is hard to argue against people (105:31 - 105:38)
at this point that talk about it and and (105:35 - 105:42)
Game Freak in a very negative way and (105:38 - 105:44)
point to this game as proof and I have (105:42 - 105:46)
to be like yeah the frame rate is (105:44 - 105:47)
terrible no they haven't fixed it no (105:46 - 105:50)
they haven't fixed these things (105:47 - 105:53)
you are valid in those specific (105:50 - 105:56)
criticisms not in the criticism as a (105:53 - 105:59)
whole but that is not that is not an (105:56 - 106:02)
internet viable conversation to have (105:59 - 106:06)
because that level of nuance can't exist (106:02 - 106:09)
in in the written short exchanges that (106:06 - 106:10)
people have on the internet (106:09 - 106:14)
it is fresh like I would love to have (106:10 - 106:16)
things brought up into like I like (106:14 - 106:18)
remakes when they bring them into a (106:16 - 106:21)
modern game having gone back and played (106:18 - 106:23)
yellow and being like this game is (106:21 - 106:26)
virtually unplayable because all the all (106:23 - 106:29)
of the life improvements are gone and (106:26 - 106:32)
I'm moving it two frames a second slowly (106:29 - 106:35)
trudging through this town (106:32 - 106:38)
when they bring them into a new (106:35 - 106:41)
style and they bring them into a new (106:38 - 106:43)
Switch and it runs better and all the (106:41 - 106:45)
life improvements are there and you can (106:43 - 106:48)
re-experience a game with all of the (106:45 - 106:50)
improvements that is very warming and (106:48 - 106:53)
comforting to me right like when they (106:50 - 106:55)
digitally remaster an album that you (106:53 - 106:57)
know a million times and it's like (106:55 - 106:59)
listening to it fresh for the first time (106:57 - 107:01)
because you hear things again those are (106:59 - 107:03)
all wonderful warming experiences and (107:01 - 107:06)
that is what I want from remakes like (107:03 - 107:09)
it's part of the reason why brilliant (107:06 - 107:10)
diamond and Shining Pearl were so (107:09 - 107:13)
disappointing because they just didn't (107:10 - 107:17)
really get us there it did not feel like (107:13 - 107:19)
it was a fresh new (107:17 - 107:22)
take and upgrade to this it just felt (107:19 - 107:23)
like this is a game with slightly better (107:22 - 107:27)
graphics but just terrible gameplay (107:23 - 107:27)
so like I understand the desire to see (107:28 - 107:34)
games that are your favorites brought (107:32 - 107:38)
into a modern era with modern things (107:34 - 107:40)
not where we're at with scarlet and (107:38 - 107:44)
violet no I do not this isn't the time (107:40 - 107:46)
to do that and this isn't the engine to (107:44 - 107:50)
do it and it's not fixed (107:46 - 107:50)
interesting thing is like (107:51 - 107:56)
um when like the frame rate is like (107:54 - 107:59)
really bad uh we've said it like every (107:56 - 108:02)
pot every week for the last eight months (107:59 - 108:03)
but like it's (108:02 - 108:06)
it's almost not surprising and I feel (108:03 - 108:08)
like the the thing I hear is like (108:06 - 108:11)
Pokemon games got real bad after Gen 5 (108:08 - 108:14)
which is I I always think it's funny (108:11 - 108:16)
because uh it has (108:14 - 108:19)
let's let's not rewrite history of how (108:16 - 108:21)
much Gen 5 was hated it is the most (108:19 - 108:24)
hated Series in the entire franchise (108:21 - 108:26)
sales numbers prove this Twitter was not (108:24 - 108:29)
a real thing when Gen 5 came out like (108:26 - 108:32)
but I was there Greg was there I I'm not (108:29 - 108:35)
sure if Hannah remembered but I I was I (108:32 - 108:39)
was podcasting I when Gen 5 came out it (108:35 - 108:42)
was by far the most hated Pokemon game (108:39 - 108:44)
ever (108:42 - 108:46)
that being said (108:44 - 108:49)
if like I think somebody commented like (108:46 - 108:52)
man old Pokemon games didn't have these (108:49 - 108:54)
issues (108:52 - 108:54)
I just want to remind everyone that (108:56 - 109:00)
before this Golden Era which some people (108:57 - 109:03)
dub is Gen 5 and before there was this (109:00 - 109:06)
game called Diamond and Pearl (109:03 - 109:11)
and it ran so miserable that when you (109:06 - 109:13)
saved your game it said the words saving (109:11 - 109:17)
a lot of data and it would take like a (109:13 - 109:21)
full minute and gen 3 and Gen 5 saved in (109:17 - 109:24)
mere seconds Platinum also saved in (109:21 - 109:27)
seconds when you attack like watch (109:24 - 109:29)
somebody go go on Twitch or go on (109:27 - 109:32)
YouTube watch somebody play a non-sped (109:29 - 109:33)
up version (109:32 - 109:36)
of heart gold soul silver or original (109:33 - 109:38)
Diamond and Pearl and watch those HP (109:36 - 109:41)
bars watch them because I guarantee you (109:38 - 109:43)
probably most of those people playing it (109:41 - 109:45)
or playing some sort of emulator which (109:43 - 109:46)
we you know I don't emulate anything (109:45 - 109:48)
just Nintendo I know sometimes you (109:46 - 109:51)
listen not me uh they're all sped up (109:48 - 109:53)
they're all sped up because those games (109:51 - 109:57)
ran so slow and sluggish (109:53 - 110:00)
they ran terrible so like again this is (109:57 - 110:02)
not defending game freak like go back to (110:00 - 110:06)
gen 1 you can break that game so fast so (110:02 - 110:08)
instantly missing no very famous (110:06 - 110:10)
everyone loved to duplicate your master (110:08 - 110:13)
ball a million times like like every (110:10 - 110:15)
single Pokemon game I could sit here on (110:13 - 110:18)
the show and nitpick to death there was (110:15 - 110:23)
a very glitch in Ruby and Sapphire that (110:18 - 110:25)
they had to put out a different game or (110:23 - 110:28)
you had to go to a mall tour to get a or (110:25 - 110:30)
you had to mail them your game to get a (110:28 - 110:32)
physical (110:30 - 110:36)
patch to fix they lit the game like no (110:32 - 110:39)
game is bug free right like no there is (110:36 - 110:42)
not a game that like there's no game is (110:39 - 110:43)
bug free nothing is bug free something (110:42 - 110:46)
always happens (110:43 - 110:46)
this is (110:46 - 110:53)
an issue of (110:49 - 110:53)
what our vision and expectations are and (110:53 - 111:00)
what the expectations of games that (110:57 - 111:02)
exist in this time period there is a (111:00 - 111:06)
stark mismatch of what other things are (111:02 - 111:08)
able to do and what this one is able to (111:06 - 111:12)
do and we can talk about that what our (111:08 - 111:14)
expectations are based off of equipment (111:12 - 111:17)
other games other a lot of other things (111:14 - 111:20)
and what we're getting in this game but (111:17 - 111:22)
to say like uh back in the day they (111:20 - 111:24)
never had no look seriously watch a (111:22 - 111:26)
health bar in half of those older's (111:24 - 111:29)
games that takes you 17 hours to get to (111:26 - 111:31)
zero in a one-hit KO where you're like (111:29 - 111:34)
I'm literally aging to death while this (111:31 - 111:36)
uh for the record (111:34 - 111:38)
for the record (111:36 - 111:40)
I want the frame rate fixed oh (111:38 - 111:41)
absolutely (111:40 - 111:43)
for the record I don't like my (111:41 - 111:47)
expectations are a game that sells 25 (111:43 - 111:50)
million copies should have an acceptable (111:47 - 111:52)
frame rate like those are my (111:50 - 111:53)
expectations I think those are a lot of (111:52 - 111:55)
the people's expectations I'm just (111:53 - 111:57)
saying like (111:55 - 112:00)
this is not new uh also to the people (111:57 - 112:02)
that are like I can't believe they're (112:00 - 112:04)
selling us back a hundred Pokemon for (112:02 - 112:07)
forty dollars again not new they did (112:04 - 112:10)
this in gen three you wanted first off (112:07 - 112:13)
boom cut you can't have any gen two or (112:10 - 112:16)
one Pokemon you want a reminder to (112:13 - 112:18)
people that their breeding was in gen 3 (112:16 - 112:21)
of here's a reminder Ruby and Sapphire (112:18 - 112:22)
you could breed (112:21 - 112:25)
all the PO you want illumise and Volbeat (112:22 - 112:26)
you could breed them don't know why you (112:25 - 112:28)
would be doing that but that's my (112:26 - 112:30)
example illumise Volbeat you want to put (112:28 - 112:32)
them two in the day can't breed them do (112:30 - 112:34)
you know what Pokemon wasn't in gen 3 (112:32 - 112:38)
I'm talking about breeding ditto if you (112:34 - 112:41)
wanted Ditto in Ruby and Sapphire you (112:38 - 112:44)
had to buy another game either fire red (112:41 - 112:47)
leaf green or emerald and then you had (112:44 - 112:49)
to get a 10 Link cable or have a friend (112:47 - 112:52)
and move that ditto over you wanted (112:49 - 112:54)
other Pokemon missing while there were (112:52 - 112:56)
two games that you could buy on a whole (112:54 - 112:58)
different console called Coliseum and (112:56 - 113:01)
Gale of Darkness this is not the first (112:58 - 113:03)
and again I'm not like defending this (113:01 - 113:06)
but this is not the first time the (113:03 - 113:08)
Pokemon company has taken Pokemon away (113:06 - 113:11)
from us and then have put it into (113:08 - 113:13)
something that you need to re-buy again (113:11 - 113:17)
this is their entire strategy for 27 (113:13 - 113:20)
years so I'm only talking to the people (113:17 - 113:22)
like they never did this in the past (113:20 - 113:26)
they did you are just uh using a bad (113:22 - 113:28)
faith argument right now they they did (113:26 - 113:31)
do they have been doing this like (113:28 - 113:32)
they're not getting rid of version (113:31 - 113:33)
exclusives they're not getting rid of (113:32 - 113:35)
trade exclusives they're not getting rid (113:33 - 113:37)
of the fact that like in the future (113:35 - 113:39)
they'll have this Pokemon over this (113:37 - 113:41)
Pokemon do you know why that has been (113:39 - 113:43)
their entire business structure for (113:41 - 113:46)
almost 30 years now they're not and it (113:43 - 113:49)
works unfortunately it works very well (113:46 - 113:51)
sword and shield has sold a lot of (113:49 - 113:53)
copies this game has sold a lot of (113:51 - 113:56)
copies it's not changing I'm still (113:53 - 113:58)
surprised Legend Arceus was one game (113:56 - 114:01)
still a huge shocker honestly (113:58 - 114:03)
if anything that might have been the (114:01 - 114:05)
most surprising thing this company has (114:03 - 114:09)
done in 25 years has put out one copy of (114:05 - 114:13)
Legends yeah that still is wild (114:09 - 114:13)
yeah (114:13 - 114:16)
so (114:15 - 114:19)
um I will say if you did not buy the DLC (114:16 - 114:22)
and the things we said earlier convinced (114:19 - 114:25)
you to go back fixed boxes fixed (114:22 - 114:29)
outbreaks fixed area zero Pokemon you do (114:25 - 114:33)
not need to buy the DLC to bring in (114:29 - 114:35)
for it or your spinner Rack or your (114:33 - 114:37)
other old Pokemon into the game you (114:35 - 114:39)
don't need to buy the DLC (114:37 - 114:41)
you also don't need to buy the DLC to (114:39 - 114:43)
participate in those rates so if (114:41 - 114:46)
somebody is hosting a cramerant raid (114:43 - 114:48)
you can join it you don't need the DLC (114:46 - 114:50)
to do that (114:48 - 114:51)
um (114:50 - 114:55)
so again to all the people are like (114:51 - 114:57)
saying like these Pokemon are behind a (114:55 - 115:00)
paywall just want to remind you (114:57 - 115:02)
that these games are not free you do (115:00 - 115:04)
have to spend at this point sixty (115:02 - 115:06)
dollars to get into scarlet and violet I (115:04 - 115:10)
guess sixty dollars buys you 400 Pokemon (115:06 - 115:13)
um but as for the DLC Pokemon they're (115:10 - 115:16)
not sure you have to spend forty dollars (115:13 - 115:18)
to experience that new content but if (115:16 - 115:19)
you want (115:18 - 115:21)
Duskull or dusclops (115:19 - 115:23)
you you can trade them in from Pokemon (115:21 - 115:25)
home you can trade them to other people (115:23 - 115:28)
you can jump into raids you do not need (115:25 - 115:30)
to spend the money to get those Pokemon (115:28 - 115:34)
back uh also Kramer ant when he follows (115:30 - 115:36)
you he makes a little Tippy tappies with (115:34 - 115:38)
his feet and he's by far still the best (115:36 - 115:41)
Pokemon in the entire world uh and that (115:38 - 115:43)
in itself has made the DLC forty dollars (115:41 - 115:45)
worth it two Scarlet players it is not (115:43 - 115:47)
worth it to Violet players because (115:45 - 115:49)
Grandma Rand is a version exclusive for (115:47 - 115:51)
some reason I told you at the start of (115:49 - 115:54)
this eight months ago I play Violet you (115:51 - 115:57)
play scarlet and you I messaged me that (115:54 - 115:59)
Scarlet's been the better version the (115:57 - 116:03)
entire time I 100 you that is the real (115:59 - 116:06)
issue and once again you didn't listen (116:03 - 116:08)
to me (116:06 - 116:10)
I'm so mad that I gotta play through (116:08 - 116:14)
Scarlett now it's fine I'm like just (116:10 - 116:16)
gotta be here before still no roses so (116:14 - 116:19)
this game can suck eggs (116:16 - 116:19)
um (116:25 - 116:29)
uh okay a couple like just minor (116:26 - 116:32)
speculation things uh I think number one (116:29 - 116:38)
is diplin works with eviolite (116:32 - 116:38)
take that for what it's worth (116:38 - 116:43)
if you don't know what evolite does it (116:40 - 116:46)
doubles your defenses if you are not a (116:43 - 116:48)
fully evolved Pokemon (116:46 - 116:51)
and this has been tested I don't think (116:48 - 116:53)
it's an issue I don't think it's a bug (116:51 - 116:55)
but diplin does work with EVO light I (116:53 - 116:58)
think this is probably intentional like (116:55 - 116:59)
they they want us to know that diplin's (116:58 - 117:01)
going to evolve (116:59 - 117:03)
uh somebody was saying that diplin or (117:01 - 117:05)
Aplin or something there's like two (117:03 - 117:08)
worms inside it yeah there are two there (117:05 - 117:10)
are two worms in diplin (117:08 - 117:12)
in Dublin (117:10 - 117:15)
but not that one applin's one Worm but (117:12 - 117:18)
diplin is two (117:15 - 117:20)
so that would make sense then there (117:18 - 117:22)
would be two texts well the worm is the (117:20 - 117:25)
dragon that's the the gimmick (117:22 - 117:28)
so apparently diplin is supposed to (117:25 - 117:29)
evolve I guess (117:28 - 117:32)
the other speculation is there's (117:29 - 117:35)
actually somebody in charge of the loyal (117:32 - 117:36)
three (117:35 - 117:40)
and if you if you look at that weird (117:36 - 117:43)
cut scene thing they did which oh is (117:40 - 117:45)
that the first time they've did like a (117:43 - 117:47)
cut scene to tell a story I mean besides (117:45 - 117:49)
the like beginning of paldea they kind (117:47 - 117:51)
of did that they didn't have that in (117:49 - 117:53)
Crown tundra or Isle of armor did they I (117:51 - 117:54)
mean depending on what you're (117:53 - 117:55)
considering (117:54 - 117:57)
well it's not a really good it's like a (117:55 - 117:59)
PowerPoint yeah I mean they've done that (117:57 - 118:02)
before yeah they've done it okay they (117:59 - 118:04)
did an X and Y they did it oh yeah they (118:02 - 118:06)
did so like there's not even a story (118:04 - 118:08)
there and they did yeah like that's not (118:06 - 118:11)
uncommon but there is at least so on NPC (118:08 - 118:13)
that talks about it maybe being their (118:11 - 118:16)
trainer the figure that's on the (118:13 - 118:18)
placards (118:16 - 118:20)
the figure on them there's a human yeah (118:18 - 118:23)
the with the loyal three (118:20 - 118:27)
oh hmm because there's a human with ogre (118:23 - 118:29)
Pond and there's a human with the loyal (118:27 - 118:31)
three (118:29 - 118:33)
I'd have to relook or so apparently in (118:31 - 118:35)
the in the PowerPoint presentation (118:33 - 118:37)
there's a fourth thing (118:35 - 118:40)
with next to the loyal three (118:37 - 118:43)
and then people are so oh the crypto (118:40 - 118:44)
lady we didn't talk about we're gonna (118:43 - 118:46)
talk about the crypto lady (118:44 - 118:49)
so there's one shop in kit well there's (118:46 - 118:52)
technically two shops the the shop by uh (118:49 - 118:54)
Millennial Nurse Joy yeah (118:52 - 118:57)
uh she she tells you she doesn't accept (118:54 - 118:58)
LP (118:57 - 119:00)
but if you keep bothering her about it (118:58 - 119:02)
not only does she bring up that she (119:00 - 119:05)
doesn't trust cryptocurrencies she (119:02 - 119:08)
eventually Buys in and then lets you (119:05 - 119:11)
use LP you just have to keep bothering (119:08 - 119:12)
her about it but yeah no I and the (119:11 - 119:13)
minute she said I don't trust (119:12 - 119:15)
cryptocurrency I said (119:13 - 119:18)
same sister which I've never used LP in (119:15 - 119:21)
this entire game there's a lot of little (119:18 - 119:23)
things about this DLC like her the (119:21 - 119:25)
Hooters (119:23 - 119:30)
syrup incredibly off-putting (119:25 - 119:31)
um (119:30 - 119:33)
but anyways so people are speculating (119:31 - 119:36)
that there's in front of her Booth (119:33 - 119:38)
there's like a pink doll (119:36 - 119:41)
and they think that is the loyal three's (119:38 - 119:42)
leader (119:41 - 119:45)
and there's like a screenshot of that (119:42 - 119:48)
pink doll and that kinda lines up with (119:45 - 119:50)
the PowerPoint that you can only barely (119:48 - 119:54)
see the fourth thing so I have no clue (119:50 - 119:56)
take that with a grain of salt it's a (119:54 - 119:58)
big grain of salt also there the the the (119:56 - 120:00)
the the Twitter account that's always (119:58 - 120:03)
wrong but then sometimes the right also (120:00 - 120:04)
tweeted that one of ogre Pond's masks (120:03 - 120:06)
was supposed to be ghost (120:04 - 120:08)
s that's it wasn't they were wrong I (120:06 - 120:09)
should make a Twitter account (120:08 - 120:12)
documenting how many times they're wrong (120:09 - 120:13)
because it's way more than the right (120:12 - 120:15)
people only remember them being right (120:13 - 120:18)
information about anyways take with that (120:15 - 120:20)
with a grain of salt there is a really (120:18 - 120:22)
weird pink thing in front of her Booth (120:20 - 120:26)
if anything it does stand out like I (120:22 - 120:27)
don't why why is this here another (120:26 - 120:29)
interesting thing about her Booth is if (120:27 - 120:32)
you zoom in like there are Pikachu and (120:29 - 120:35)
Eevee like crackers or chips those are (120:32 - 120:36)
like real things that you can buy in (120:35 - 120:40)
Japan so that's kind of cool that you (120:36 - 120:42)
can see that they're like real (120:40 - 120:44)
things (120:42 - 120:45)
um (120:44 - 120:47)
uh (120:45 - 120:48)
also if you're catching the loyal three (120:47 - 120:50)
I don't know if this works or not but (120:48 - 120:53)
the only booth that sells ramen in the (120:50 - 120:55)
festival gives you catch power poison (120:53 - 120:58)
too I don't think that's a coincidence I (120:55 - 121:00)
don't know if catch power with the loyal (120:58 - 121:02)
three I mean they're all poison I used (121:00 - 121:04)
it I caught all of them under five (121:02 - 121:05)
minutes (121:04 - 121:09)
so I don't know confirmation bias there (121:05 - 121:13)
so over catch rates I am can we just be (121:09 - 121:15)
done can we just that's why I'm telling (121:13 - 121:17)
you to get the catch power catch power (121:15 - 121:20)
can we just see Greg didn't use it and (121:17 - 121:22)
they're mad I did use it I'm not mad I (121:20 - 121:24)
didn't use it I didn't use it and it (121:22 - 121:26)
took me five minutes for each but also (121:24 - 121:28)
if I have it at one hit point and (121:26 - 121:32)
paralyzed it still it is this whole (121:28 - 121:34)
catch rate thing is just dumb it is dumb (121:32 - 121:36)
at this point (121:34 - 121:40)
just end it just end it like it is so (121:36 - 121:43)
refreshing in raids to have a one-hit (121:40 - 121:47)
catch like I'm gonna get it that is that (121:43 - 121:51)
does not diminish my experience in any (121:47 - 121:54)
way just let me catch these things in a (121:51 - 121:56)
ball that I want it has been nearly 30 (121:54 - 122:01)
years of catch rates ended be done let's (121:56 - 122:03)
just be done They don't serve any (122:01 - 122:05)
purpose anymore it's not up it's never (122:03 - 122:07)
been a fun mechanic it's not ever going (122:05 - 122:10)
to be a fun mechanic (122:07 - 122:13)
it would be a fun mechanic in my eyes if (122:10 - 122:15)
there was more than one way to catch (122:13 - 122:18)
sleeping and fall swiping everything is (122:15 - 122:20)
not this is the argument we have with (122:18 - 122:21)
let's go Pikachu let's go Evie where (122:20 - 122:23)
people were like I miss battling Pokemon (122:21 - 122:25)
to catch them I was like why yeah you're (122:23 - 122:26)
just gonna you're just gonna you're just (122:25 - 122:28)
gonna Spore them and then fall swipe (122:26 - 122:30)
them and then do the same thing I'm (122:28 - 122:31)
doing right now which is just Huck (122:30 - 122:34)
pokeballs until it catches it's not it's (122:31 - 122:37)
not an exciting thing anymore and if you (122:34 - 122:39)
want some sort of strategy like maybe (122:37 - 122:41)
like one out of 400 Pokemon you're (122:39 - 122:42)
bringing a Pokemon with damp and maybe (122:41 - 122:44)
like three out of 400 Pokemon you're (122:42 - 122:46)
bringing a Pokemon with soak so you can (122:44 - 122:47)
do the same thing which is Spore and (122:46 - 122:50)
fall swipe like if anything in let's go (122:47 - 122:52)
Pikachu we cut out half of that battle (122:50 - 122:55)
item like we've we saved some time there (122:52 - 122:58)
um if there were moves that were like (122:55 - 123:00)
this Pokemon can only learn this move (122:58 - 123:02)
and this move makes it where it's easier (123:00 - 123:04)
to catch grass Pokemon that would be (123:02 - 123:05)
more interesting because then I would (123:04 - 123:07)
like think about what Pokemon I would be (123:05 - 123:09)
bringing to catch I think SOS was maybe (123:07 - 123:11)
the closest we got to that of like (123:09 - 123:13)
um the catch stuff uh other thing that (123:11 - 123:14)
we didn't mention that was new was the (123:13 - 123:19)
selfie stick they did fix the camera (123:14 - 123:21)
so I actually did a couple fixes for the (123:19 - 123:23)
camera number one is you don't have to (123:21 - 123:26)
hide the overlay to take a picture if (123:23 - 123:27)
you just take a picture the overlay (123:26 - 123:29)
won't be included in the photo which is (123:27 - 123:30)
great (123:29 - 123:31)
um the other thing is you can tell (123:30 - 123:34)
Pokemon to stand still yep uh which is (123:31 - 123:37)
great both of those do not require the (123:34 - 123:39)
40 DLC man if you're listening to this (123:37 - 123:41)
podcast and you're watching on YouTube (123:39 - 123:44)
uh now's your time to comment your (123:41 - 123:46)
favorite thing that you liked in the DLC (123:44 - 123:50)
um why and why do we need a selfie stick (123:46 - 123:52)
and a phone that flies (123:50 - 123:54)
we cannot answer that question this (123:52 - 123:56)
podcast is too long but if you did spend (123:54 - 123:58)
the forty dollars you get the selfie (123:56 - 124:02)
stick which is not the free thing (123:58 - 124:05)
um but you can take better photos uh (124:02 - 124:07)
like the photos are genuinely more (124:05 - 124:09)
interesting and better and the other (124:07 - 124:12)
thing is this DLC adds a lot of emotes (124:09 - 124:15)
oh a lot of some of these and some of (124:12 - 124:16)
the emotes are like behind like little (124:15 - 124:18)
very very little like side things like (124:16 - 124:20)
show me a Pokemon or like but they're (124:18 - 124:22)
they're like cool like I didn't think (124:20 - 124:23)
that they were gonna do that but there (124:22 - 124:25)
are new emotes (124:23 - 124:27)
um which is DLC forty dollars for new (124:25 - 124:29)
emotes forty dollars for selfie stick uh (124:27 - 124:31)
taking pictures is actually more fun now (124:29 - 124:34)
they succeeded (124:31 - 124:34)
okay cool (124:36 - 124:42)
my very last thing and then I'm done (124:39 - 124:44)
talking we can end the show is I still (124:42 - 124:46)
think (124:44 - 124:49)
trainers in an open world (124:46 - 124:52)
needs to be addressed and I don't know (124:49 - 124:56)
how that has to be addressed it works (124:52 - 125:00)
really well in a linear Game Works super (124:56 - 125:02)
well in the linear game yeah like I I I (125:00 - 125:05)
could sit here and I can over level in (125:02 - 125:06)
Viridian Forest (125:05 - 125:08)
and then I can destroy everything and (125:06 - 125:11)
then eventually it'll catch up with me I (125:08 - 125:12)
get it (125:11 - 125:15)
there are so many trainers scattered (125:12 - 125:18)
around kitakami and there are two types (125:15 - 125:21)
there are the the little kids who send (125:18 - 125:23)
out Geodude also okay okay with the (125:21 - 125:25)
exception of the Geodude kid who uses (125:23 - 125:27)
self-destruct on both of you like his (125:25 - 125:29)
type I love that kid (125:27 - 125:32)
he's awesome but like (125:29 - 125:34)
somebody was somebody said like man I (125:32 - 125:37)
wish I wish there I wish they were level (125:34 - 125:39)
100 and I was like what would be the (125:37 - 125:42)
difference between a level 70 circuit (125:39 - 125:45)
and a level 100 sir Skippy nothing like (125:42 - 125:47)
they're all using like service kit (125:45 - 125:50)
Geodude Centric yeah spinner rack (125:47 - 125:52)
they're using the Pokemon there none of (125:50 - 125:54)
them are challenging now you could (125:52 - 125:57)
the weird thing about the both deals (125:54 - 126:00)
like all three DLCs are (125:57 - 126:03)
you are you you've already played the (126:00 - 126:05)
game for six plus months and so (126:03 - 126:08)
therefore you probably have a very (126:05 - 126:09)
powerful team (126:08 - 126:11)
because you beat the you beat the (126:09 - 126:13)
champion you continued playing you (126:11 - 126:15)
probably have a handful of 100 level 100 (126:13 - 126:18)
Pokemon you could be like well I'm gonna (126:15 - 126:20)
box those Pokemon I'm Gonna Catch what's (126:18 - 126:23)
here and then I'm gonna battle (126:20 - 126:26)
catching a level 67 Central (126:23 - 126:28)
leveling it up once to fur it and then (126:26 - 126:31)
battling a level 70 circuit is not (126:28 - 126:34)
interesting also it's so and get putting (126:31 - 126:36)
them it's so weird to have like here's a (126:34 - 126:39)
Bellsprout that's leveled 950 I'm like (126:36 - 126:42)
what is happening in this region (126:39 - 126:45)
like like it's cool that the Pokemon are (126:42 - 126:48)
high levels and it's but (126:45 - 126:50)
I don't like I wanna I would love to sit (126:48 - 126:52)
down and be like how do you want people (126:50 - 126:54)
to play if you want people to catch the (126:52 - 126:58)
Pokemon here and then use that then do (126:54 - 126:59)
something like do like a storyline thing (126:58 - 127:02)
like your box is locked until you get to (126:59 - 127:04)
this part of the game like here's the (127:02 - 127:06)
thing people wouldn't like going to a (127:04 - 127:08)
new region and your Pokemon have to be (127:06 - 127:09)
quarantined until it's proven that (127:08 - 127:11)
they're not bringing foreign diseases (127:09 - 127:14)
and you have to catch only locals (127:11 - 127:16)
okay but even even that (127:14 - 127:19)
this this isn't even a DLC problem but (127:16 - 127:22)
like even the trainers in paldea are (127:19 - 127:24)
kind of pointless to battle like none of (127:22 - 127:26)
them are particularly (127:24 - 127:28)
um they don't really say anything well (127:26 - 127:29)
they don't really have any unique (127:28 - 127:31)
Pokemon they don't really give you that (127:29 - 127:33)
much money or that much experience they (127:31 - 127:35)
made so like they're they're there is an (127:33 - 127:37)
exception with like the oh yeah (127:35 - 127:41)
um the ogre Clan they have I think they (127:37 - 127:42)
all have like four or five Pokemon they (127:41 - 127:44)
all have like a theme I think there's (127:42 - 127:46)
eight maybe there's seven members I've (127:44 - 127:48)
only seven I've only about like three or (127:46 - 127:49)
four (127:48 - 127:51)
um and even so I was walking around with (127:49 - 127:54)
level 100 Pokemon that (127:51 - 127:56)
um I was just getting ribbons on I was (127:54 - 127:58)
like here's my glass rear from VGC that (127:56 - 127:59)
already had all five ribbons let me get (127:58 - 128:01)
some more ribbons here's my mighty Mew (127:59 - 128:03)
that has like five ribbons let me get (128:01 - 128:05)
more ribbons on it here's my (128:03 - 128:09)
um antique synasty that I caught let me (128:05 - 128:11)
get the ribbons on that so none of these (128:09 - 128:14)
Pokemon are like I literally just (128:11 - 128:15)
transferred them in had the default move (128:14 - 128:17)
sets which are all bad when you (128:15 - 128:18)
transferred and I think last year knew (128:17 - 128:20)
like four normal type moves and (128:18 - 128:21)
literally nothing else and it's a nice (128:20 - 128:23)
Pokemon (128:21 - 128:26)
and like (128:23 - 128:28)
I'm just crushing bellsprouts and I'm (128:26 - 128:29)
just like destroying trainers with (128:28 - 128:31)
Centra and it's and I'm thinking like (128:29 - 128:33)
well maybe I should box these Pokemon (128:31 - 128:34)
but like (128:33 - 128:37)
I don't want to catch a Bellsprout or a (128:34 - 128:38)
centroid and then level it up and use (128:37 - 128:42)
those that doesn't sound fun either (128:38 - 128:43)
um and then when I was battling the ogre (128:42 - 128:45)
Clan I was like oh cool they have like (128:43 - 128:48)
held items seems like they maybe are EV (128:45 - 128:50)
trained they definitely have a strategy (128:48 - 128:53)
but also like I'm gonna chilling name my (128:50 - 128:56)
way to Victory here and that's cool (128:53 - 128:58)
um (128:56 - 129:00)
I don't know how they fix I I think they (128:58 - 129:03)
fixed that by like forcing you to be the (129:00 - 129:05)
same level so like battle battle yeah (129:03 - 129:08)
right or like mustard I think mustard (129:05 - 129:10)
the mustard battles I mentioned earlier (129:08 - 129:12)
were the same like I think almost if (129:10 - 129:14)
they want something like that just say (129:12 - 129:17)
that the you know they're 80 if you're (129:14 - 129:20)
82 or 100 you go up down to 80. like I (129:17 - 129:21)
don't think every battle needs to be (129:20 - 129:24)
that like it's very clear that there are (129:21 - 129:26)
some filler battles that's fine like you (129:24 - 129:28)
could go in here with like a you know if (129:26 - 129:29)
you didn't beat the game those trainers (129:28 - 129:31)
make sense because those Pokemon would (129:29 - 129:33)
be a way lower level and you can (129:31 - 129:36)
experience that I totally get that but (129:33 - 129:38)
then have the opposite like these (129:36 - 129:40)
trainers are here for you know somebody (129:38 - 129:41)
who just wants to experience the DLC (129:40 - 129:43)
they're just here for filler (129:41 - 129:46)
um but these these ogre people (129:43 - 129:49)
that sounds offensive (129:46 - 129:49)
there there was clearly thought put into (129:51 - 129:56)
their teams (129:54 - 129:56)
but like how am I supposed to know what (129:57 - 130:01)
level they are and like my teams are (129:59 - 130:03)
already level 100 because I played (130:01 - 130:04)
through the game so do you want me to (130:03 - 130:06)
catch different Pokemon and then get (130:04 - 130:10)
them to 80 and then it seems very (130:06 - 130:12)
it seems like I have to do so much work (130:10 - 130:15)
as a player yeah (130:12 - 130:18)
to be like I'm okay now I'm I'm doing it (130:15 - 130:20)
right in there's no right way (130:18 - 130:23)
and candy (130:20 - 130:25)
wild trainers which is awesome don't (130:23 - 130:27)
make sense anymore (130:25 - 130:28)
when it was the best way to level (130:27 - 130:31)
Pokemon like you wanted to find and like (130:28 - 130:32)
for a secret was the thing because I (130:31 - 130:34)
need to level Pokemon and like have to (130:32 - 130:36)
do that grind that that grind doesn't (130:34 - 130:38)
exist anymore so (130:36 - 130:43)
the way I see them fixing trainers is (130:38 - 130:45)
that trainers out in the world need to (130:43 - 130:48)
have some sort of story to them that's (130:45 - 130:50)
giving you a lower bit of Interest (130:48 - 130:54)
something that you are learning from (130:50 - 130:57)
them that makes interacting with them (130:54 - 131:00)
worthwhile that's not just I like shorts (130:57 - 131:03)
and now I'm gonna battle you like they (131:00 - 131:06)
need to be side quests more than just (131:03 - 131:08)
battles they need to be there needs to (131:06 - 131:11)
now be some bigger purpose for them (131:08 - 131:13)
being there other than filling empty (131:11 - 131:15)
space which is honestly what it feels (131:13 - 131:17)
like like I'm in a Barren patch and (131:15 - 131:19)
there's a person that I'm there's one (131:17 - 131:21)
guy I'm gonna give a wide berth because (131:19 - 131:23)
I do not want to waste my time in a (131:21 - 131:26)
level 60 battle when I have all 100s I (131:23 - 131:29)
don't care I don't care I'm not doing (131:26 - 131:32)
this (131:29 - 131:32)
yeah I uh again this DLC is not battle (131:32 - 131:37)
heavy (131:36 - 131:39)
um (131:37 - 131:42)
and I I I just think that like (131:39 - 131:45)
wearing this weird open world Pokemon (131:42 - 131:47)
now and the things that we're working in (131:45 - 131:49)
the past are (131:47 - 131:51)
not working here and I don't know how (131:49 - 131:53)
they fix it (131:51 - 131:54)
um (131:53 - 131:56)
I I think you know I I think the the (131:54 - 131:59)
battles I had the most fun with were the (131:56 - 132:01)
three Titan battles and it was because (131:59 - 132:04)
even though I was level 100 they had so (132:01 - 132:06)
much health (132:04 - 132:09)
that they could still set up and do (132:06 - 132:11)
something and I thought that was more (132:09 - 132:13)
interesting are they cheat are they (132:11 - 132:15)
quote unquote cheating like the cars in (132:13 - 132:17)
in powder yeah sure but like it's it's (132:15 - 132:20)
still fun like like knocking out the (132:17 - 132:23)
monkey Dory was significantly more fun (132:20 - 132:27)
than crushing 12 trainers with surskit (132:23 - 132:28)
like (132:27 - 132:31)
um like I I was like oh I kind of wish (132:28 - 132:33)
my move set was better here from this (132:31 - 132:35)
glass rear because I don't double edging (132:33 - 132:38)
working out too well (132:35 - 132:38)
but like (132:39 - 132:43)
they can do and like the interesting (132:41 - 132:45)
thing about the Titan stuff is I I (132:43 - 132:46)
actually don't know what level they were (132:45 - 132:48)
I'm assuming like the monkey Dory was (132:46 - 132:50)
level like 70. yeah or something I mean (132:48 - 132:52)
because when you catch them they're 70 (132:50 - 132:54)
but like the Titan battle never shows (132:52 - 132:55)
you the level (132:54 - 132:57)
and which is fine like and I almost feel (132:55 - 132:59)
like that's how (132:57 - 133:03)
battles should be except again I think (132:59 - 133:05)
you're okay with having filler battles (133:03 - 133:07)
for people who just started the game (133:05 - 133:09)
want to go to the DLC right away the (133:07 - 133:11)
Pokemon are lower level I get that but (133:09 - 133:13)
then the higher end battles of the ogre (133:11 - 133:16)
people still feel (133:13 - 133:18)
off they feel challenging enough (133:16 - 133:22)
but they still feel like (133:18 - 133:24)
you're asking me to do work to change my (133:22 - 133:28)
team to be on their level when you can I (133:24 - 133:30)
don't know but I could over level and it (133:28 - 133:32)
doesn't matter (133:30 - 133:32)
yeah and you know the argument is like (133:32 - 133:35)
well that's your choice for over (133:34 - 133:38)
leveling I totally get that but like the (133:35 - 133:39)
thing is is (133:38 - 133:42)
the one thing I will knock about both (133:39 - 133:46)
DLCs is when they make the DLC the first (133:42 - 133:49)
one capable if you start the game fresh (133:46 - 133:52)
and you're going there at level 15. when (133:49 - 133:55)
they are trying to straddle that we (133:52 - 133:57)
don't know when you're going to come (133:55 - 134:01)
here it it the DLC suffers a little bit (133:57 - 134:04)
because it feels really weird when (134:01 - 134:06)
you're high level to be running into (134:04 - 134:08)
these Basic Pokemon at these wild levels (134:06 - 134:10)
but it also Bellsprout at level 80. it (134:08 - 134:12)
also feels really weird to leave your (134:10 - 134:16)
main storyline to do a whole side quest (134:12 - 134:19)
Island to come back to your main (134:16 - 134:21)
storyline it feels weird in sword and (134:19 - 134:23)
shield and I can guarantee it will feel (134:21 - 134:27)
weird to do it here and I don't know how (134:23 - 134:30)
they fixed that disconnect to make it (134:27 - 134:32)
like they clearly want to make it (134:30 - 134:34)
accessible for people who are getting (134:32 - 134:38)
the completed the complete Game new (134:34 - 134:41)
um complete heavily in quotes like it (134:38 - 134:43)
it's a finished game and they add a DLC (134:41 - 134:46)
like understand that I'm saying all (134:43 - 134:49)
parts that they've put out as complete (134:46 - 134:52)
um so I I think (134:49 - 134:53)
foreign (134:52 - 134:56)
those are just those are just design (134:53 - 134:58)
decisions that I think the Pokemon (134:56 - 135:00)
company needs to really ruminate on and (134:58 - 135:03)
figure out what (135:00 - 135:06)
a better play experience is given those (135:03 - 135:09)
limitations and this isn't it for me (135:06 - 135:13)
right now it's fine it it it feels off (135:09 - 135:15)
every time like I just replayed all of (135:13 - 135:17)
sword and it felt off when I went to (135:15 - 135:19)
Isle of armor at level 15 because I (135:17 - 135:21)
couldn't get every everywhere also (135:19 - 135:23)
because it didn't have a bike that can (135:21 - 135:25)
go to the bike (135:23 - 135:27)
um so it felt really weird to be there (135:25 - 135:32)
to be like I'm gated off but also (135:27 - 135:35)
I'm here and I can do some like it felt (135:32 - 135:37)
weird and this also feels weird and it (135:35 - 135:38)
feels weird to go there after when (135:37 - 135:41)
they're all like here's a Geodude that's (135:38 - 135:44)
level 5000 and (135:41 - 135:46)
it only knows explode or like all the (135:44 - 135:48)
coffings that are level 60 that all no (135:46 - 135:50)
self-destruct moves (135:48 - 135:53)
it is like how is this fun this is real (135:50 - 135:55)
momentum (135:53 - 135:57)
the best timing is probably right after (135:55 - 136:00)
you beat the main game before you've (135:57 - 136:02)
done a whole ton of raids before you've (136:00 - 136:03)
leveled up everything to level 100 (136:02 - 136:06)
that's when this DLC fits in (136:03 - 136:08)
the best but the problem is it came out (136:06 - 136:11)
months after yeah (136:08 - 136:13)
again I think I think there's a deeper (136:11 - 136:15)
conversation to have where people are (136:13 - 136:18)
like I wish the gym leaders level scaled (136:15 - 136:22)
and I don't agree with that (136:18 - 136:25)
um and I I could spend an hour of why I (136:22 - 136:28)
don't agree with that but because you've (136:25 - 136:30)
beaten the game and you've done all of (136:28 - 136:32)
these raids I'm thinking of a person (136:30 - 136:33)
that's coming back and they're doing (136:32 - 136:35)
Mewtwo and they're doing Delphox and (136:33 - 136:38)
they're doing score bunny cinderes (136:35 - 136:41)
and they're playing every day (136:38 - 136:44)
and then to go into the DLC six months (136:41 - 136:46)
eight months later and then the best (136:44 - 136:48)
trainers are level 80 (136:46 - 136:53)
they're asking you to give up your team (136:48 - 136:55)
not asking but maybe insinuating that (136:53 - 136:57)
you give up your team to go kind of down (136:55 - 136:59)
to their level to make it challenging (136:57 - 137:01)
which you can do (136:59 - 137:03)
and I know a lot like at least like this (137:01 - 137:05)
is my new kitakami team (137:03 - 137:07)
but at least with the the first part (137:05 - 137:10)
you're not uh level 100 right away (137:07 - 137:11)
you're you're working and you're (137:10 - 137:14)
building that so like if you go to Iona (137:11 - 137:16)
first and she crushes you you're like I (137:14 - 137:18)
gotta come back later if you (137:16 - 137:20)
accidentally missed the bug type gym (137:18 - 137:21)
leader (137:20 - 137:24)
and you go over there you're like I did (137:21 - 137:27)
the work here and I crushed them (137:24 - 137:29)
um because I missed them and that's like (137:27 - 137:31)
fine that happens in like Fallout and (137:29 - 137:33)
Eldon ring and all that stuff of like oh (137:31 - 137:35)
this area is like way lower I missed it (137:33 - 137:37)
I Crush everything here but but like (137:35 - 137:39)
there is no other the you just go in (137:37 - 137:40)
crushing everyone because you have all (137:39 - 137:44)
because it's just been so long (137:41 - 137:47)
uh of that so if anything why don't they (137:44 - 137:48)
just set them out like I said like (137:47 - 137:50)
there's no point in setting the surskate (137:48 - 137:52)
to level 100. (137:50 - 137:55)
obviously it's a source kit but like why (137:52 - 137:57)
does why not just set the ogre Clan to (137:55 - 138:00)
level 100 and then if you got destroyed (137:57 - 138:01)
by them (138:00 - 138:04)
the raids give you so much candy like (138:01 - 138:06)
yeah just come back it's not that big of (138:04 - 138:07)
a deal (138:06 - 138:09)
like I I don't (138:07 - 138:10)
like as somebody who loves building (138:09 - 138:13)
Pokemon and building teams and seeing (138:10 - 138:15)
all the new Pokemon it just feels weird (138:13 - 138:17)
to be like okay I'm going to get them (138:15 - 138:22)
specifically to 80 to battle them (138:17 - 138:22)
but Arthur like all my good Pokemon had (138:23 - 138:27)
to build for that it also makes the (138:25 - 138:29)
Mochi make more sense and be useful like (138:27 - 138:31)
there are more interactions yeah but (138:29 - 138:33)
then you also have to like look up that (138:31 - 138:36)
they're like I don't are they all 80 I'm (138:33 - 138:38)
assuming they're all 80. I don't know (138:36 - 138:41)
I've only done four (138:38 - 138:41)
um but like at a certain point and then (138:42 - 138:45)
you're looking stuff up and that feels (138:43 - 138:47)
weird too like oh well then I'm gonna (138:45 - 138:48)
see their team I'm gonna know what there (138:47 - 138:51)
are I don't know I I it's (138:48 - 138:53)
the the I guess the nice thing is you (138:51 - 138:54)
can do that if you want to the game's (138:53 - 138:56)
not forcing you but like there's only (138:54 - 138:57)
eight of them I don't know make them (138:56 - 138:59)
level 100 it's not that big of a deal (138:57 - 139:00)
like you clearly put thought into their (138:59 - 139:02)
team order they're they're they're (139:00 - 139:03)
they're they're they're clearly holding (139:02 - 139:05)
items (139:03 - 139:07)
um (139:05 - 139:07)
I I think (139:07 - 139:12)
there are some design philosophy things (139:10 - 139:14)
that need to be thought out heavily (139:12 - 139:18)
going forward (139:14 - 139:18)
um overall I like the DLC uh (139:19 - 139:23)
uh I was a fan of it (139:22 - 139:25)
sounds like Hannah liked it sounds like (139:23 - 139:29)
Greg hated it that's you know I say this (139:25 - 139:32)
it's a solid okay for me I don't regret (139:29 - 139:35)
buying it I don't regret (139:32 - 139:38)
I I (139:35 - 139:38)
would be where you were at if I didn't (139:38 - 139:43)
find that storyline so offensive and so (139:40 - 139:46)
deeply deeply troubling (139:43 - 139:49)
um sure sure I totally get why you don't (139:46 - 139:52)
like it um but like I think (139:49 - 139:56)
for a DLC (139:52 - 139:56)
it's I get I would as I told everybody (139:57 - 140:02)
it's fine (139:59 - 140:02)
you know it's not going to make you love (140:03 - 140:10)
this game it's not doing anything (140:05 - 140:14)
shocking it's it is just fine it's just (140:10 - 140:16)
more of the same game yeah (140:14 - 140:18)
I was hoping for a couple big surprises (140:16 - 140:20)
and (140:18 - 140:22)
fixing bugs was actually a nice surprise (140:20 - 140:24)
but that was not the surprise that was (140:22 - 140:26)
not the gameplay surprise I was I was uh (140:24 - 140:30)
