to go in well they had one on the window (4:01 - 4:06)
and one inside (4:04 - 4:08)
because it was that it was the toxicity (4:06 - 4:10)
thing but there were two of them (4:08 - 4:12)
so he hit it twice (4:10 - 4:14)
yeah that was weird i ended up with like (4:12 - 4:17)

company international did send me that (13:24 - 13:29)
big package that we opened up on twitch (13:26 - 13:30)
if you missed the twitch it took me (13:29 - 13:32)
three hours to open all that mostly (13:30 - 13:34)
because i get distracted very easily um (13:32 - 13:36)
but we took the best of that and we cut (13:34 - 13:38)
it down to well there's be two parts (13:36 - 13:41)
first part's already up 20 minutes long (13:38 - 13:42)
that's the first 90 minutes i cut down (13:41 - 13:45)
to 20 minutes so that's on youtube (13:42 - 13:47)

you would make a very small indent into (14:31 - 14:37)
that whole set (14:35 - 14:38)
and you'd be lucky in that etb if you (14:37 - 14:40)
got like one full art if you got super (14:38 - 14:43)
lucky maybe like one full art a secret (14:40 - 14:45)
rare and you know maybe like two rares (14:43 - 14:47)
that's like unheard of i don't know what (14:45 - 14:49)
you're talking about (14:47 - 14:51)
an etv for the record is like eight (14:49 - 14:53)
packs (14:51 - 14:53)
but i feel like you could get away with (14:54 - 14:57)
buying (14:55 - 14:59)
like five packs (14:57 - 15:02)
and have a lot of the set already done (14:59 - 15:04)
and there's some exciting cards that (15:02 - 15:05)
you'd probably get in those five packs (15:04 - 15:08)
like it does feel like something where (15:05 - 15:10)
if they were easily available (15:08 - 15:12)
on shelves while you're checking out (15:10 - 15:14)
target it'd be like oh i heard about (15:12 - 15:16)
this yeah let's pick up a couple packs (15:14 - 15:19)
like i really do feel like that is (15:16 - 15:20)
something for somebody who doesn't (15:19 - 15:23)
collect the tcg versus (15:20 - 15:25)
what are you gonna do with (15:23 - 15:26)
five packs of children reigns there (15:25 - 15:28)
ain't no there ain't nothing like (15:26 - 15:29)
there ain't nothing really great in (15:28 - 15:31)
those (15:29 - 15:32)
these are really (15:31 - 15:34)
unless you really love calorics or (15:32 - 15:37)
horses (15:34 - 15:38)
just horses (15:37 - 15:42)
underestimate the horse fan contingency (15:38 - 15:43)
there are a lot of horse people out (15:42 - 15:45)
there (15:43 - 15:46)
i'm sure there are (15:45 - 15:49)
i'm sure there are um but yeah like i (15:46 - 15:52)
think chilling rain was 200 cards or (15:49 - 15:54)
something was the total plus the secret (15:52 - 15:56)
rares so that's talking like 230 or (15:54 - 15:58)
something oh yeah versus the 50 of this (15:56 - 16:00)
one and that was kind of that's funny (15:58 - 16:02)
back when detective pikachu came out (16:00 - 16:03)
they had that little mini set of (16:02 - 16:05)
detective pikachu with maybe like 30 (16:03 - 16:07)
cards i think and they had little four (16:05 - 16:08)
card packs as well (16:07 - 16:10)
and that actually (16:08 - 16:11)
got me like (16:10 - 16:13)
jumped into the back end of the tcg a (16:11 - 16:15)
little bit that little mini set because (16:13 - 16:17)
i was like oh i can collect these like (16:15 - 16:18)
maybe i can complete this set it's like (16:17 - 16:21)
25 cards or something that might be fun (16:18 - 16:24)
uh didn't last unfortunately (16:21 - 16:25)
but you know i feel like that's kind of (16:24 - 16:27)
the same with this one just being a (16:25 - 16:30)
smaller set and (16:27 - 16:31)
i don't know if you've been around since (16:30 - 16:33)
the beginning times of pokemon and (16:31 - 16:35)
collected the cards back then it's a (16:33 - 16:36)
little you know a little bit of (16:35 - 16:39)
nostalgia as well since it's a lot of (16:36 - 16:40)
since there's a bunch of like classic (16:39 - 16:43)
cards and things like that so (16:40 - 16:44)
i don't know i'm happy with it i my (16:43 - 16:46)
stuff still hasn't arrived i pre-ordered (16:44 - 16:48)
a bunch of stuff from gamestop none of (16:46 - 16:52)
it is even shipped yet and yet i ordered (16:48 - 16:54)
two things from the pokemon center (16:52 - 16:55)
yesterday and they're supposed to be (16:54 - 16:57)
here tomorrow so i don't know what's (16:55 - 16:58)
going on with gamestop i don't know why (16:57 - 17:00)
it's taking them so long to get their (16:58 - 17:02)
act together but i still haven't opened (17:00 - 17:03)
anything and i'm (17:02 - 17:06)
slightly bummed about that (17:03 - 17:06)
what is going on with gamestop i don't (17:07 - 17:11)
think anyone can answer that question (17:08 - 17:13)
i think we've hinted towards the (17:11 - 17:15)
question (17:13 - 17:15)
let's do our pokemon unite minute here (17:16 - 17:22)
uh (17:20 - 17:24)
sylveon is now available in pokemon (17:22 - 17:28)
unite and got nerfed today (17:24 - 17:30)
oh i think i cut out there greg (17:28 - 17:34)
it came out on what the fifth wednesday (17:30 - 17:36)
they nerfed it today (17:34 - 17:38)
they cut damage down quick today real (17:36 - 17:40)
quick said quick nerf them fixed (17:38 - 17:43)
venusaur nah blastoise totally fine can (17:40 - 17:45)
shoot water across the entire map and (17:43 - 17:47)
stop you from doing anything (17:45 - 17:49)
sylveon can take like (17:47 - 17:53)
one pokemon down maybe two nerf it (17:49 - 17:55)
no i think so garbage (17:53 - 17:57)
like i (17:55 - 17:59)
was watching (17:57 - 18:01)
the the the high-end players you know (17:59 - 18:03)
the top ten people they play on the team (18:01 - 18:05)
or the top five people in unite playing (18:03 - 18:06)
a team (18:05 - 18:07)
and (18:06 - 18:10)
it was it was 20 plus kills every game (18:07 - 18:12)
it was unreal what they were doing i (18:10 - 18:15)
mean they're good right wait the top (18:12 - 18:17)
five unite players all are on the same (18:15 - 18:20)
team yeah (18:17 - 18:21)
that's (18:20 - 18:24)
okay i mean it's a team-based game (18:21 - 18:26)
it is but that's like that would be like (18:24 - 18:29)
if like the usa dream team was like all (18:26 - 18:31)
in the same nba like on the same (18:29 - 18:33)
basketball team or something instead of (18:31 - 18:34)
like (18:33 - 18:36)
within the nba like that seems unfair (18:34 - 18:39)
that just seems unfair i don't know like (18:36 - 18:41)
i get sports analogies it kind of made (18:39 - 18:44)
sense (18:41 - 18:44)
i mean they haven't fixed the other (18:45 - 18:48)
stuff (18:47 - 18:50)
it was fine (18:48 - 18:54)
do a big balance plan let people enjoy (18:50 - 18:56)
sylveon (18:54 - 18:59)
for a week you have not fixed the petal (18:56 - 19:01)
dance garbage of venusaur i mean maybe (18:59 - 19:03)
there may have barely done anything for (19:01 - 19:07)
blastoise but this cute wonderful thing (19:03 - 19:11)
can can be in the sunlight for two days (19:07 - 19:13)
and then you nerf it into the ground (19:11 - 19:15)
yeah it seems weird that it was so quick (19:13 - 19:17)
because it that makes it seem like the (19:15 - 19:20)
data that came back within 24 hours (19:17 - 19:22)
maybe was like (19:20 - 19:23)
showed something was wrong with it i (19:22 - 19:25)
mean i'm telling you people were rocking (19:23 - 19:26)
it on the (19:25 - 19:29)
the matches i watched i was like jeez (19:26 - 19:30)
they were (19:29 - 19:32)
like (19:30 - 19:33)
in a situation where it's cramerant (19:32 - 19:35)
versus bees (19:33 - 19:37)
i feel like i'm working hard even if i'm (19:35 - 19:39)
like level 12 i'm like i gotta work (19:37 - 19:41)
these bees you guys gotta give me a (19:39 - 19:42)
moment i'm still i'm struggling over (19:41 - 19:44)
here and then like with sylveon it was (19:42 - 19:45)
like (19:44 - 19:47)
like a roomba (19:45 - 19:49)
on the first day (19:47 - 19:52)
working amazingly like just (19:49 - 19:54)
sucking up those bees instantly and (19:52 - 19:55)
we're not talking about like a three (19:54 - 19:56)
year old room but you know that thing's (19:55 - 19:58)
struggling out there but we're talking (19:56 - 20:00)
about like fresh out of the box well (19:58 - 20:03)
this this was 600 bucks that sylvia was (20:00 - 20:05)
working (20:03 - 20:08)
um i don't know like (20:05 - 20:11)
i don't feel like blastoise has been a (20:08 - 20:14)
problem since they fixed the like (20:11 - 20:16)
bugs that blast always had like (20:14 - 20:18)
the fixing the bug took like a week and (20:16 - 20:21)
a half yeah that's true and sylveon (20:18 - 20:22)
they're like nope (20:21 - 20:24)
two days (20:22 - 20:26)
nerf it (20:24 - 20:29)
garbage this is garbage choices also (20:26 - 20:30)
you're right they haven't done anything (20:29 - 20:32)
about venusaur but peddled it like (20:30 - 20:36)
venusaur's pedal dance is unreal it is (20:32 - 20:38)
it lasts like eight seconds and then (20:36 - 20:40)
it's like two seconds and then you get (20:38 - 20:41)
it again for another eight seconds (20:40 - 20:44)
because it's the countdown doesn't start (20:41 - 20:46)
over again after the move ends the (20:44 - 20:48)
countdown starts (20:46 - 20:50)
when you use the move the move lasts six (20:48 - 20:52)
seconds (20:50 - 20:55)
the countdown is eight so when it ends (20:52 - 20:57)
two seconds and you fire it up again (20:55 - 20:59)
it's like the most (20:57 - 21:02)
ridiculous amount of time (20:59 - 21:04)
oh and you can't outrun that thing (21:02 - 21:06)
either he's not outright he's hustling i (21:04 - 21:08)
don't run that thing it's a hustle and (21:06 - 21:10)
frog it is so overpowered and they're (21:08 - 21:12)
like oh it's fine (21:10 - 21:14)
but you're gonna look at sylvian who is (21:12 - 21:16)
doing (21:14 - 21:17)
hey sylvia was out there working she was (21:16 - 21:19)
she was she was doing it look (21:17 - 21:22)
okay so hyper voice (21:19 - 21:27)
could do 6 000 points of damage (21:22 - 21:27)
big deal (21:27 - 21:30)
let (21:29 - 21:32)
get your money (21:30 - 21:33)
i mean they fixed hyper voice fixed (21:32 - 21:35)
mystical player maybe they got their (21:33 - 21:38)
money and they saw like a huge spike of (21:35 - 21:39)
like oh people aren't buying anymore so (21:38 - 21:41)
now if that's then what about blastoise (21:39 - 21:43)
people aren't buying blasphemous (21:41 - 21:45)
meanwhile mammo swine (21:43 - 21:48)
is out there trying to work man (21:45 - 21:50)
got done dirty by these developers you (21:48 - 21:53)
don't see us urgent fixed that nah (21:50 - 21:56)
sylveon's out there represent the trans (21:53 - 21:58)
community doing the work (21:56 - 22:01)

with charizard (22:21 - 22:26)
they just keep pumping charizard and (22:24 - 22:28)
everybody still picks charizard because (22:26 - 22:29)
it's the favorite (22:28 - 22:32)
um i'm sure i'm sure i'm sure they'll (22:29 - 22:34)

actually i thought it was just gonna be (23:03 - 23:07)
like (23:05 - 23:10)
sylveon from the start oh yeah that's (23:07 - 23:11)
what i thought (23:10 - 23:13)
i was like what (23:11 - 23:15)
this is gonna get (23:13 - 23:17)
complicated if they introduce the other (23:15 - 23:19)
ones right i was gonna say sylveon's the (23:17 - 23:21)
first evolution right yeah so who cares (23:19 - 23:23)
about the other ones i mean sylveon is (23:21 - 23:26)
the best one (23:23 - 23:26)
am i wrong there are (23:27 - 23:32)

there's a dark sylveon (24:10 - 24:14)
in the tcg (24:12 - 24:16)
not to be confused with darkness type (24:14 - 24:17)
greg (24:16 - 24:19)
darkness type is (24:17 - 24:20)
the (24:19 - 24:23)
dark energy what makes it dark (24:20 - 24:25)
dark would mean that it was trained by (24:23 - 24:26)
team rocket (24:25 - 24:28)
like dark dragonite dark charizard you (24:26 - 24:30)
remember those cards back in the day (24:28 - 24:33)
yeah but it can't be that bad because (24:30 - 24:35)
sylveon (24:33 - 24:37)
evolves with friendship (24:35 - 24:39)
it's a it's a pouty silver it's a pretty (24:37 - 24:41)
cool card actually (24:39 - 24:43)

how is that pouty he's got his back to (24:52 - 24:55)
you it's just not exactly it's not (24:54 - 24:57)
friendly to you because you're judging (24:55 - 24:59)
it about being dark it's trying to live (24:57 - 25:02)
its best life trying to nuke people on (24:59 - 25:04)
the field and you come in two days later (25:02 - 25:06)
call it dark and nerf it (25:04 - 25:07)
that yeah that's that is exactly what (25:06 - 25:10)
happened (25:07 - 25:10)
uh speaking for part of the course (25:10 - 25:14)
pokemon evolutions episode three is out (25:12 - 25:16)
the visionary watch that i have not (25:14 - 25:19)
watched it but i have been told i've (25:16 - 25:20)
heard it's not good (25:19 - 25:22)
that it does not answer any of the (25:20 - 25:24)
questions that were (25:22 - 25:26)
happening in x and y (25:24 - 25:29)
i'm looking at the screenshot here (25:26 - 25:31)
i see i see a xerneas in the screenshot (25:29 - 25:34)
i see uh i see lysander and i see a mega (25:31 - 25:36)
gyarados (25:34 - 25:37)
um (25:36 - 25:40)
so i expect to see the virtual boy on (25:37 - 25:42)
lysander at some point (25:40 - 25:44)
of the plot lines (25:42 - 25:46)
i don't feel like there were a lot of (25:44 - 25:48)
questions left in x and y (25:46 - 25:51)
yeah there was (25:48 - 25:54)
why is tiarano at my parade like get out (25:51 - 25:57)
of here man because you're best friends (25:54 - 26:00)
no who is your dance instructor he did (25:57 - 26:02)
not follow me down into the the dark (26:00 - 26:04)
pits to battle pitbull and then to (26:02 - 26:07)
battle lysander with a virtual boy (26:04 - 26:09)
also why does az think it's okay to do a (26:07 - 26:12)
battle during my parade because you are (26:09 - 26:13)
a champion and you are (26:12 - 26:16)
supposed to accept challenges whenever (26:13 - 26:18)
they happen he should wherever happened (26:16 - 26:20)
with getting a job because he was in (26:18 - 26:21)
prison for like two years (26:20 - 26:23)
and he probably doesn't have any income (26:21 - 26:25)
you are there to help him get back into (26:23 - 26:27)
society you have abandoned him well he (26:25 - 26:30)
can whatever until i get to the top and (26:27 - 26:32)
get my trust at the end of that game (26:30 - 26:34)
bothers me so much did get in the top (26:32 - 26:36)
you're in the middle of your parade all (26:34 - 26:37)
of the stuff that happened you've (26:36 - 26:39)
already been declared champion at that (26:37 - 26:42)
point your obligation would you (26:39 - 26:44)
stop santa (26:42 - 26:46)
mid-parade no yes (26:44 - 26:49)
if santa was my next challenge to become (26:46 - 26:51)
a champion of the region (26:49 - 26:54)
you bet i'm saying pull over (26:51 - 26:58)
it is time to throw down fat man (26:54 - 27:01)
let's go (26:58 - 27:01)
all right everybody put it that way (27:01 - 27:06)
maybe i changed my mind yeah you bet (27:04 - 27:09)
change your mind (27:06 - 27:11)
look i love x and y i say it all the (27:09 - 27:12)

partake in a play pokemon event with the (32:29 - 32:34)
first very official pokemon go (32:32 - 32:36)
championship series it's very i know it (32:34 - 32:38)
because they said it (32:36 - 32:40)
now i know what you're thinking they had (32:38 - 32:43)
pokemon go at the dc (32:40 - 32:45)
world (32:43 - 32:47)
that was an invitational it was invite (32:45 - 32:49)
only it was like (32:47 - 32:52)
masuda i think was one of the people in (32:49 - 32:54)
that tournament and he used the psyduck (32:52 - 32:55)
um (32:54 - 32:56)
that was (32:55 - 33:00)
it was like very cute and it was (32:56 - 33:00)
i don't want to be negative (33:00 - 33:05)
but watching a bunch of people play (33:03 - 33:08)
early gbl on stage at worlds and (33:05 - 33:10)
realizing how slow gbl kind of is (33:08 - 33:13)
sometimes (33:10 - 33:15)
not the most entertaining thing to watch (33:13 - 33:16)
no (33:15 - 33:17)
not at all (33:16 - 33:19)
[Laughter] (33:17 - 33:24)
so is it going to be the gbl at (33:19 - 33:24)
i can answer some of those questions for (33:24 - 33:27)
you (33:26 - 33:29)
to register for the pokemon go (33:27 - 33:31)
championship series of events you must (33:29 - 33:34)
be your home region's age uh digital (33:31 - 33:36)
consent or older you also need to have a (33:34 - 33:38)
linked pokemon go account to your (33:36 - 33:40)
trainer club account have a player id (33:38 - 33:42)
opt-in to play terms of use and the (33:40 - 33:44)
ability to create the ability to create (33:42 - 33:46)
an account and link will be available in (33:44 - 33:49)
late 2021 registration for the first (33:46 - 33:52)
time will open in january so just to (33:49 - 33:54)
clarify here if you made a pokemon go (33:52 - 33:56)
account back in the day you either (33:54 - 33:58)
picked google or trainer club you tried (33:56 - 34:00)
to pick trainer club remember it was (33:58 - 34:01)
broken for like the first like month (34:00 - 34:03)
correct (34:01 - 34:05)
[Laughter] (34:03 - 34:08)
and since then you could link it but (34:05 - 34:10)
that linking isn't working right now for (34:08 - 34:12)
the play pokemon stuff so (34:10 - 34:13)
they're gonna fix that before the end of (34:12 - 34:15)
the year but theoretically what i would (34:13 - 34:17)
recommend too is you can like link your (34:15 - 34:19)
pogo to like more than one email (34:17 - 34:21)
you do like gmail and then you could do (34:19 - 34:25)
like either facebook or your apple um id (34:21 - 34:26)
or like one other thing (34:25 - 34:29)
yeah that's apple facebook google and (34:26 - 34:31)
pokemon trainer club you should do two (34:29 - 34:34)
of those is what i'm saying (34:31 - 34:36)
at least i mean if nothing else like (34:34 - 34:37)
facebook (34:36 - 34:38)
two days ago showed us that (34:37 - 34:40)
anybody who needed to log in with (34:38 - 34:42)
facebook to couldn't play pokemon go the (34:40 - 34:45)
other day either yeah period of time so (34:42 - 34:46)
definitely (34:45 - 34:47)
you should probably do two of those just (34:46 - 34:50)
in case one goes down (34:47 - 34:52)
um additionally as previously announced (34:50 - 34:54)
access to early registration will be (34:52 - 34:56)
granted to pokemon go players who (34:54 - 34:58)
perform well in go battle league for the (34:56 - 35:00)
first batch of invites players much must (34:58 - 35:03)
achieve legend rank in season 9 in order (35:00 - 35:05)
to qualify details for later events will (35:03 - 35:07)
be added once the corresponding go (35:05 - 35:08)
battle league season is announced (35:07 - 35:10)
tournaments for pokemon go will operate (35:08 - 35:13)
seniors and masters division and will (35:10 - 35:13)
run (35:13 - 35:15)
the great league format that's actually (35:13 - 35:17)
really great (35:15 - 35:19)
no pun intended for specific uh format (35:17 - 35:21)
details stay tuned to the rules and (35:19 - 35:23)
documents will be available soon (35:21 - 35:25)
to ensure an even playing field (35:23 - 35:27)
participants at most qualifiers will be (35:25 - 35:29)
re required to log into their go account (35:27 - 35:31)
and to battle using a smart devices (35:29 - 35:34)
provided on site if this is not this is (35:31 - 35:35)
not (35:34 - 35:37)
the case for specific events (35:35 - 35:39)
the organizers will announce that (35:37 - 35:41)
separately (35:39 - 35:43)
okay (35:41 - 35:46)
so a lot of things here number one is (35:43 - 35:47)
they said four (35:46 - 35:51)
games competing tcg video game series (35:47 - 35:53)
pokken pokemon go there's no word of (35:51 - 35:55)
unite (35:53 - 35:56)
i bet they're gonna do the thing that (35:55 - 35:59)
they did with pokemon go unite is going (35:56 - 36:02)
to be an invitational this 2022 they're (35:59 - 36:05)
going to find like four of the best (36:02 - 36:07)
teams (36:05 - 36:09)
they're going to like showcase it (36:07 - 36:10)
because those are highly skilled players (36:09 - 36:12)
and then they're going to set it up for (36:10 - 36:14)
anyone to be able to play for 2023 that (36:12 - 36:17)
would be my bet there is no way (36:14 - 36:19)
we somebody write down the time stamp (36:17 - 36:22)
there is no way at the 2022 world (36:19 - 36:24)
championships there will not be unite up (36:22 - 36:28)
on that stage in some capacity (36:24 - 36:28)
that's a bold prediction i mean i guess (36:28 - 36:33)
i guess it makes sense i mean they have (36:33 - 36:36)
really (36:35 - 36:39)
uh they're really going all with it for (36:36 - 36:41)
unite right now so and it doesn't seem (36:39 - 36:43)
to well i don't know does is it is it (36:41 - 36:45)
losing steam at all i mean (36:43 - 36:47)
unite like it it's got they had that (36:45 - 36:50)
initial bump for sure is it i think it (36:47 - 36:52)
did what (36:50 - 36:53)
i thought it was going to do (36:52 - 36:55)
which is be (36:53 - 36:57)
mediocrity popular in the united states (36:55 - 37:00)
and be incredibly popular in (36:57 - 37:02)
in asia and it is like if you watch (37:00 - 37:04)
korean streamers or japanese streamers (37:02 - 37:05)
or (37:04 - 37:07)
um here this is really hard to explain (37:05 - 37:09)
but let me try to explain it if you (37:07 - 37:11)
watch anyone from an asian country and (37:09 - 37:13)
you just watch them long enough you'll (37:11 - 37:16)
see that their matches are so varied and (37:13 - 37:17)
so different you watch an american (37:16 - 37:20)
streamer you'll see like the same names (37:17 - 37:23)
pop up constantly like (37:20 - 37:25)
like oh like i just played this dude two (37:23 - 37:27)
games ago (37:25 - 37:29)
like the it seems that the player pool (37:27 - 37:32)
for the american servers are so much (37:29 - 37:33)
smaller (37:32 - 37:34)
than the player pools in other countries (37:33 - 37:36)
and obviously you want to try to match (37:34 - 37:38)
to people closer to you for lag and (37:36 - 37:40)
stuff but (37:38 - 37:41)
maybe maybe i'm jaded but that's my (37:40 - 37:45)
experience at least with it (37:41 - 37:45)
interesting i i don't know i am still (37:45 - 37:49)
stuck (37:48 - 37:52)
on are people actually gonna stand on (37:49 - 37:53)
stage (37:52 - 37:56)
with their smartphones in hand (37:53 - 37:59)
to play go battle league which is just (37:56 - 38:01)
tapping the phone (37:59 - 38:03)
and hitting one button (38:01 - 38:04)
sometimes too sometimes there's two (38:03 - 38:07)
charge moves down there (38:04 - 38:09)
and then swiping (38:07 - 38:11)
that (38:09 - 38:13)
that's that's the thing they're doing (38:11 - 38:17)
hey people play poker (38:13 - 38:20)
that has choices (38:17 - 38:22)
you have choices in battle yeah but the (38:20 - 38:23)
choices (38:22 - 38:25)
sure you have like one choice in battle (38:23 - 38:25)
but (38:25 - 38:27)
most of those are done before the battle (38:25 - 38:29)
starts you have two choices okay yeah (38:27 - 38:32)
i'm not disagreeing with you i just (38:29 - 38:34)
cannot fathom (38:32 - 38:35)
sitting (38:34 - 38:37)
in the audience (38:35 - 38:41)
when anything else could be going on (38:37 - 38:44)
to watch static animations on a giant (38:41 - 38:47)
screen and two people (38:44 - 38:48)
not (38:47 - 38:50)
like writing things down or trying to (38:48 - 38:51)
decide if they're gonna switch out (38:50 - 38:53)
literally tapping a screen and then (38:51 - 38:56)
moving slightly to hit a button (38:53 - 38:58)
there is okay (38:56 - 38:59)
i i (38:58 - 39:00)
i'm not trying to defend anything (38:59 - 39:01)
it is (39:00 - 39:04)
the wildest thing i've heard like i (39:01 - 39:06)
thought like it's (39:04 - 39:06)
hey (39:06 - 39:08)
we're going to release a bun it's like a (39:06 - 39:10)
bug contest try to catch the most rare (39:08 - 39:12)
thing catch the highest ep that would be (39:10 - 39:14)
cool that would be interesting like run (39:12 - 39:16)
around do something (39:14 - 39:19)
the battle system in pokemon go is the (39:16 - 39:21)
most boring part of that game it's (39:19 - 39:23)
pretty bad (39:21 - 39:25)
i and you're gonna put it on a stage (39:23 - 39:28)
okay (39:25 - 39:28)
i'm going to say some stuff (39:29 - 39:33)
before i say it i want to say that i (39:31 - 39:36)
agree with everything rick just said (39:33 - 39:38)
i do agree with greg (39:36 - 39:41)
i do i do have some more things to add (39:38 - 39:43)
so i was looking through my costume (39:41 - 39:45)
collection in pokemon go there's a (39:43 - 39:47)
costume decks (39:45 - 39:50)
i think there's like 102 costumes total (39:47 - 39:51)
or something like that (39:50 - 39:54)
and i have 92 of them so i'm missing (39:51 - 39:56)
like the flower happy knee i'm missing a (39:54 - 39:58)
couple of raichu's which i have i just (39:56 - 40:00)

but i didn't i don't care about go (40:22 - 40:26)

you can get it (40:39 - 40:44)
from omega ruby and alpha sapphire (40:41 - 40:46)
that's true or i could maybe trade (40:44 - 40:49)
somebody for it yes all possible things (40:46 - 40:52)
but (40:49 - 40:54)
so so i'm looking i'm looking so i'm (40:52 - 40:55)
sitting here playing pokemon go on (40:54 - 40:56)
twitch (40:55 - 40:58)
it was spotlight hour (40:56 - 41:01)
a quick aside there are some people that (40:58 - 41:03)
still don't know spotlight hours just a (41:01 - 41:05)
thing that exists every tuesday from six (41:03 - 41:07)
to seven local time (41:05 - 41:09)
it's it's it's existed before the (41:07 - 41:10)
pandemic it's been around for a while (41:09 - 41:12)
this is my only time frame is when the (41:10 - 41:14)
pandemic started and what features were (41:12 - 41:16)
added and not happening (41:14 - 41:18)
because it's been like 50 years (41:16 - 41:19)
um (41:18 - 41:22)
so we're like doing spotlight hour and (41:19 - 41:24)
then i'm like oh i don't have the (41:22 - 41:25)
pikachu libre cause i'm like looking at (41:24 - 41:27)
things i'm missing and then i like click (41:25 - 41:28)
on go battle league (41:27 - 41:31)
and it says like ultra cup (41:28 - 41:34)
ultra cup whatever and then it says (41:31 - 41:36)
little jungle cup (41:34 - 41:38)
and i was like i'm out i'm not (41:36 - 41:40)
interested in anything that isn't great (41:38 - 41:42)
league because ultra cup you got to (41:40 - 41:44)
spend on you gotta chop off your arm and (41:42 - 41:47)
then cash it in for stardust like no way (41:44 - 41:48)
am i doing in the ultra you have to have (41:47 - 41:50)
like half deoxys (41:48 - 41:52)
stardust that's true you have to have (41:50 - 41:54)
like deoxys from like (41:52 - 41:57)
2003 specifically caught at this lake (41:54 - 41:59)
park over here and like it has to be in (41:57 - 42:02)
defense form and it has to have like (41:59 - 42:04)
three attack and 50 like you have to (42:02 - 42:05)
have the most complicated thing in the (42:04 - 42:08)
world for ultra cup whatever (42:05 - 42:10)
that's where the pros are (42:08 - 42:12)
the people who know (42:10 - 42:14)
and the only and if you want to even (42:12 - 42:16)
play in master cup you got to get like a (42:14 - 42:19)
brazilian dialga that's 15 15 15 and (42:16 - 42:21)
then you got to make it your best bud (42:19 - 42:22)
and then you gotta (42:21 - 42:23)
i'm out (42:22 - 42:25)
this is all whatever and then okay so i (42:23 - 42:28)
see little jungle cup i'm like what is (42:25 - 42:29)
this (42:28 - 42:31)
and they're like 500 cp (42:29 - 42:34)
this sounds great 500 that's one third (42:31 - 42:37)
of 1500 cp i'm in (42:34 - 42:40)
so i i go to google (42:37 - 42:42)
smash on my keyboard hold on for the for (42:40 - 42:43)
the (42:42 - 42:47)
smash on my keyboard here and (42:43 - 42:47)
i i type (42:47 - 42:52)
jungle cup teams (42:50 - 42:55)
and the first team said ducklit (42:52 - 42:58)
and i was like i'm all in ducklit i love (42:55 - 43:01)
ducklit i can get behind (42:58 - 43:03)
a team with ducklit on it i was like (43:01 - 43:06)
cool so i go back to pokemon go i type (43:03 - 43:08)
in ducklit i have (43:06 - 43:10)
two (43:08 - 43:13)
because why would you have more than two (43:10 - 43:16)
ducklit you would be like i have too (43:13 - 43:18)
many ducklit well just throw them away (43:16 - 43:21)
which is what i do in pokemon go i for (43:18 - 43:24)
some reason had 36 gallerian ponyta so (43:21 - 43:26)
what i did is i just randomly picked 30 (43:24 - 43:29)
of them and was like goodbye and now i (43:26 - 43:31)
have six so i have two ducklit (43:29 - 43:32)
and i was like okay they're both under (43:31 - 43:35)
500 cp (43:32 - 43:37)
so i did the thing of like (43:35 - 43:39)
plus the cp to see how close they would (43:37 - 43:41)
get to 500 (43:39 - 43:43)
and one of them got to like 4.96 and i (43:41 - 43:45)
was like okay well that's as good as (43:43 - 43:46)
we're getting right we can't go above (43:45 - 43:49)
500. otherwise disqualified (43:46 - 43:51)
so i was like i put aside the ducklit (43:49 - 43:52)
i'm looking at the list they're (43:51 - 43:54)
recommending all these pokemon and they (43:52 - 43:57)
were like chansey i was like okay (43:54 - 43:58)
chansey ducklit i think i understand (43:57 - 44:00)
what they're going for i'd like go over (43:58 - 44:02)
type in chancy i have (44:00 - 44:04)
one chansey (44:02 - 44:07)
happens to be exactly 500 cp though so (44:04 - 44:09)
i'm over the moon i'm like this is (44:07 - 44:10)
perfect (44:09 - 44:13)
and then the last one was show (44:10 - 44:15)
i decided i was like oh let me try (44:13 - 44:16)
shellmet right (44:15 - 44:20)
type in shellmet i got two shelmets (44:16 - 44:23)
and i they're both under 500 so i do the (44:20 - 44:24)
little plus thing and one of the (44:23 - 44:27)
shelmets can get to 500 cp and i was (44:24 - 44:29)
like this is great this is great i mean (44:27 - 44:30)
there's lots of other pokemon you know (44:29 - 44:33)
cottony and what you know zubat you know (44:30 - 44:34)
these pokemon (44:33 - 44:37)
i was like i'm gonna go all in i'm gonna (44:34 - 44:39)
teach them all second moves (44:37 - 44:43)
i'm the power of them up i've i spent (44:39 - 44:43)
254 000 stardust quarter of a million (44:44 - 44:48)
stardust (44:47 - 44:50)
because you second moves or 50 000 (44:48 - 44:53)
stardust for maybe for what chansey no (44:50 - 44:55)
no all of them well chansey was like 75 (44:53 - 44:57)
000 or something (44:55 - 44:59)
one was 75 the other two were 50. (44:57 - 45:01)
i don't remember which one okay so i did (44:59 - 45:03)
the second moves power powered up the (45:01 - 45:05)
cps (45:03 - 45:07)
did all that stuff (45:05 - 45:08)
quarter of a million started us to get (45:07 - 45:10)
here (45:08 - 45:12)
now i want to pre i want a preference (45:10 - 45:13)
preference (45:12 - 45:16)
preface (45:13 - 45:19)
breakfast preface i want to preface (45:16 - 45:20)
that (45:19 - 45:22)
i hate go battling (45:20 - 45:25)
but i don't hate it because i'm bad at (45:22 - 45:25)
it (45:25 - 45:28)
i think i'm relatively decent at it (45:25 - 45:30)
um (45:28 - 45:32)
is it permit (45:30 - 45:34)
it's hitting the screen (45:32 - 45:35)
yeah i know it's interesting and you're (45:34 - 45:37)
a cookie clicker (45:35 - 45:39)
champ from trims (45:37 - 45:41)
so long story short (45:39 - 45:43)
i'm (45:41 - 45:43)
i don't know what hold on (45:46 - 45:51)
i can't remember the record long story (45:49 - 45:53)
short (45:51 - 45:53)
i agree with everything greg said (45:54 - 46:02)
but i've experienced it firsthand i (45:58 - 46:04)
don't understand i really don't i'm (46:02 - 46:07)
trying to i'm trying to like (46:04 - 46:09)
you know stand in these people's shoes (46:07 - 46:11)
but the amount of stardust and the (46:09 - 46:14)
amount of time and like (46:11 - 46:15)
me just (46:14 - 46:17)
being lucky enough to have ducklit and (46:15 - 46:19)
if i'm thinking like junk go battle (46:17 - 46:21)
league is he's here i wanna let's say (46:19 - 46:25)
i'm like a hardcore pokemon go battler (46:21 - 46:29)
and oh you can't catch ducklit right now (46:25 - 46:30)
where are you supposed to get a ducklit (46:29 - 46:33)
you want a chansey (46:30 - 46:35)
good luck finding a chansey in the wild (46:33 - 46:36)
like (46:35 - 46:38)
it's (46:36 - 46:38)
dumbfounding to me (46:39 - 46:42)
that (46:41 - 46:44)
a competitive (46:42 - 46:46)
pokemon go player (46:44 - 46:49)
has to just like (46:46 - 46:51)
constantly check every pokemon they (46:49 - 46:52)
catch (46:51 - 46:54)
not like the like check the three star (46:52 - 46:57)
or four star they have to like (46:54 - 47:01)
check it of can this get to 500 or 1500 (46:57 - 47:03)
or whatever it is because it's not (47:01 - 47:05)
perfect perfect perfect it's like (47:03 - 47:07)
oh the attack has to be three and the (47:05 - 47:10)
defense the hp and the what defense has (47:07 - 47:14)
to be 15. it's like such a weird (47:10 - 47:16)
system to get like i understand like the (47:14 - 47:18)
lower the attack the like smaller (47:16 - 47:20)
increments the cp goes up and that's (47:18 - 47:23)
what actually matters (47:20 - 47:25)
um (47:23 - 47:26)
but what if i didn't have any like what (47:25 - 47:27)
if i didn't have ducklit what if i (47:26 - 47:28)
didn't like what if i didn't have these (47:27 - 47:30)
pokemon i mean yeah i guess i built (47:28 - 47:32)
another team (47:30 - 47:33)
but (47:32 - 47:37)
then i have to have all the stardust (47:33 - 47:38)
to then power it up and i have to have (47:37 - 47:40)
the candy (47:38 - 47:42)
and i have to like (47:40 - 47:43)
because you have to have the candy to do (47:42 - 47:44)
the move with the stardust so i caught (47:43 - 47:46)
enough ducklit obviously to have the (47:44 - 47:48)
ducklit candy (47:46 - 47:50)
and then i'm thinking about this and i'm (47:48 - 47:52)
like (47:50 - 47:54)
okay on october (47:52 - 47:56)
10th (47:54 - 47:57)
these three pokemon are useless they're (47:56 - 48:01)
done they i gave them all second moves i (47:57 - 48:03)
powered them up and they're they're (48:01 - 48:05)
garbage they're done now before anyone (48:03 - 48:07)
is like well in the video game the the (48:05 - 48:09)
you know your old competitive pokemon (48:07 - 48:10)
are (48:09 - 48:12)
are you're right they are but i also (48:10 - 48:14)
don't have to spend eight hours outside (48:12 - 48:16)
catching the same pokemon over and over (48:14 - 48:19)
to then cash it in (48:16 - 48:22)
like i mean (48:19 - 48:24)
what some people would say like (48:22 - 48:27)
you get to go outside for eight hours (48:24 - 48:29)
nobody says that (48:27 - 48:31)
nobody's happy about that they clearly (48:29 - 48:33)
want you to live in the game right i (48:31 - 48:34)
mean that's the whole point like having (48:33 - 48:37)
to do these checks having to like do all (48:34 - 48:38)
of that (48:37 - 48:39)
keeps you looking at the game it keeps (48:38 - 48:40)
you in there longer like you don't get (48:39 - 48:42)
to do the whole i'm just gonna catch a (48:40 - 48:44)
few things see if they're (48:42 - 48:46)
good like you know three stars or (48:44 - 48:49)
whatever and leave now i get to do all (48:46 - 48:50)
this and i have to grind this out and i (48:49 - 48:52)
have to do that like they want you to do (48:50 - 48:55)
that and they clearly like (48:52 - 48:56)
whether people do it or not i don't know (48:55 - 48:58)
i mean it seems like it's pretty popular (48:56 - 49:00)
uh i mean the go battle league seems (48:58 - 49:03)
pretty popular and so people are doing (49:00 - 49:04)
it people are living in the game they're (49:03 - 49:06)
giving them the money they need for the (49:04 - 49:09)
stardust costs and the stardust pieces (49:06 - 49:10)
or star pieces and (49:09 - 49:13)
they're trading with people and you know (49:10 - 49:15)
making it happen so (49:13 - 49:17)
this is (49:15 - 49:20)
early pokemon (49:17 - 49:22)
problems right like right like this is (49:20 - 49:25)
like the gen 3 probably all over again (49:22 - 49:27)
gen 2 and be like (49:25 - 49:30)
at the time we loved the breeding system (49:27 - 49:31)
now (49:30 - 49:34)
it is awful like (49:31 - 49:36)
because people are interacting with it (49:34 - 49:38)
now because they have no other (49:36 - 49:40)
other choice like this is how the game (49:38 - 49:41)
was built (49:40 - 49:44)
does not mean that's good or fun (49:41 - 49:45)
like (49:44 - 49:46)
the like (49:45 - 49:49)
the grind is only acceptable because (49:46 - 49:52)
it's technically a new game yeah like (49:49 - 49:53)
it's been (49:52 - 49:57)
five years and go battle like (49:53 - 49:57)
it (49:57 - 50:01)
it is still just tapping the screen (49:58 - 50:02)
yeah okay (50:01 - 50:04)
and (50:02 - 50:04)
i i agree with both of you i don't like (50:05 - 50:10)
the go battling at all i have not done (50:08 - 50:12)
it in multiple seasons now like i do (50:10 - 50:14)
want to get the did you get the libre (50:12 - 50:17)
pikachu steve no okay so i'm ranked 10. (50:14 - 50:19)
no i'm i've done all this and i have not (50:17 - 50:22)
received an award i am rank 10 i have (50:19 - 50:26)
done 46 battles i have won 34 of them (50:22 - 50:29)
and i won 12 battles in a row (50:26 - 50:30)
so again i want to say that i don't (50:29 - 50:32)
think i'm particular like obviously my (50:30 - 50:35)
win ratio very good right now (50:32 - 50:36)
um (50:35 - 50:38)
i don't think i'm awful i go battling (50:36 - 50:40)
i think i've made some mistakes a lot of (50:38 - 50:42)
my losses in go battle league like you (50:40 - 50:44)
it is just like in vgc sometimes it's (50:42 - 50:46)
just imp you have three pokemon there (50:44 - 50:49)
are like 40 pokemon in jungle cup that (50:46 - 50:50)
you can pick from so like (50:49 - 50:53)
every like out of my 12 losses or (50:50 - 50:55)
however many that is yeah 34 plus 12 is (50:53 - 50:57)
46. out of my 12 losses i think half of (50:55 - 51:01)
them were against um like altaria teams (50:57 - 51:03)
i can't beat altaria (51:01 - 51:05)
it just it's an auto lease for me unless (51:03 - 51:07)
they miss play i just lose and that's (51:05 - 51:08)
okay (51:07 - 51:10)
like my team can clearly beat almost (51:08 - 51:12)
every other team here like i'm good if (51:10 - 51:14)
all zarya shows and then you of course (51:12 - 51:15)
you got somebody in twitch chat they're (51:14 - 51:17)
like well maybe you should change your (51:15 - 51:18)
team for altaria yeah well then i'll (51:17 - 51:20)
lose to something else like there is not (51:18 - 51:23)
a single team that can beat everything (51:20 - 51:25)
that's that's pokemon right that's (51:23 - 51:26)
pokemon um (51:25 - 51:28)
so i'm i'm good i'm good with the team i (51:26 - 51:30)
like my team i lead with ducklit i like (51:28 - 51:35)
ducklit i'm able to use a pokemon i like (51:30 - 51:35)
i want to just (51:36 - 51:40)
let's go let's back up a second 500 cp a (51:37 - 51:43)
quarter of a million stardust (51:40 - 51:45)
what the the time investment the amount (51:43 - 51:49)
of candy you need and stardust you need (51:45 - 51:51)
and catching the same pokemon you need (51:49 - 51:55)
for ultra or master is just (51:51 - 51:56)
what (51:55 - 51:58)
why would and (51:56 - 52:00)
let's say let's say (51:58 - 52:02)
that that grind didn't exist let's say (52:00 - 52:06)
like you're okay with the grind (52:02 - 52:08)
go battle league is the laggiest (52:06 - 52:11)
unforgiving frustrating game in the (52:08 - 52:14)
entire world imagine grinding like three (52:11 - 52:16)
months for like a perfect dialga and (52:14 - 52:18)
then the game just lags out and you're (52:16 - 52:20)
like i click i tap the button four times (52:18 - 52:22)
and they're going first i don't i (52:20 - 52:24)
i can't tap any harder (52:22 - 52:25)
um (52:24 - 52:26)
if i would have went first i would have (52:25 - 52:28)
won but clearly the game decided i (52:26 - 52:31)
didn't tap first (52:28 - 52:31)
it's it's a very frustrating experience (52:31 - 52:35)
i will say i've had fun with it like you (52:33 - 52:38)
know i had fun with it because (52:35 - 52:42)
of the low commitment that the game had (52:38 - 52:43)
me had me do i happened to have the (52:42 - 52:46)
right pokemon it was a low barrier to (52:43 - 52:47)
entry (52:46 - 52:49)
greg is right i'm starter stress rich it (52:47 - 52:50)
doesn't like the stardust thing is like (52:49 - 52:53)
not that big of a deal but (52:50 - 52:55)
even though i've had fun with (52:53 - 52:57)
the jungle cup (52:55 - 53:00)
like (52:57 - 53:02)
it's still a barrier to entry to so many (53:00 - 53:04)
people (53:02 - 53:06)
to be like do you have these pokemon (53:04 - 53:08)
nope you don't oh you you do have (53:06 - 53:10)
cottony but they're all over 500. oh (53:08 - 53:12)
it's too bad can't use it you throw away (53:10 - 53:16)
all your zubats sorry sucks (53:12 - 53:19)
like i i i don't know (53:16 - 53:22)
what the better situation is (53:19 - 53:26)
but it feels like the grind and or money (53:22 - 53:28)
that you put into the game is not worth (53:26 - 53:30)
the actual it feels like hey you want to (53:28 - 53:32)
play chess cool go out to the woods and (53:30 - 53:34)
whittle some pieces because like well (53:32 - 53:35)
that's what true masters do they become (53:34 - 53:37)
one of the sets like i don't want to (53:35 - 53:38)
worry about pieces (53:37 - 53:40)
like i don't i want to play the chess (53:38 - 53:45)
game of then download the app (53:40 - 53:45)
here's the thing like (53:46 - 53:50)
what (53:48 - 53:52)
there are usually it's pokemon company (53:50 - 53:54)
they're usually not great safeguards for (53:52 - 53:57)
people to do shenanigans on (53:54 - 53:59)
getting the pokemon they need (53:57 - 54:02)
like it is problem i still think i'm (53:59 - 54:04)
still stuck on the fact that they expect (54:02 - 54:05)
an audience (54:04 - 54:08)
to sit and watch this because i watched (54:05 - 54:10)
you play and i lasted about 20 minutes (54:08 - 54:14)
before i'm like i could be doing (54:10 - 54:14)
anything else with my life (54:14 - 54:18)
i could be asleep (54:17 - 54:20)
hey there was some sick plays though (54:18 - 54:24)
yeah listen you complained i hit heavy i (54:20 - 54:27)
hit it i had it and it didn't accept it (54:24 - 54:30)
i heavy slammed that's pretty much yeah (54:27 - 54:32)
that's that's the game in the nuts (54:30 - 54:33)
first off it was body slam thank you (54:32 - 54:35)
very much (54:33 - 54:35)
um think i think there's potential there (54:36 - 54:41)
for go battling in the sense that like (54:39 - 54:43)
matches are quick like that's why i (54:41 - 54:44)
liked clash royale and i think that's (54:43 - 54:46)
why you like clash royale greg like (54:44 - 54:48)
you're you're you're probably going to (54:46 - 54:50)
be there to two to three minutes if it (54:48 - 54:51)
goes into overtime overtime's only an (54:50 - 54:54)
extra minute yeah it's in and out and (54:51 - 54:55)
you're done (54:54 - 54:58)
right and i get that for the normal (54:55 - 54:59)
video game (54:58 - 55:02)
or for the tcg (54:59 - 55:04)
those matches can go (55:02 - 55:06)
way way over 10 minutes (55:04 - 55:08)
how i don't know what the timer is in (55:06 - 55:09)
sword and shield whenever i think the (55:08 - 55:12)
timer's 15 maybe but (55:09 - 55:15)
those those matches can be long (55:12 - 55:17)
and so it's nice to be able to (55:15 - 55:20)
get like a three four minute match in (55:17 - 55:21)
like right before bed or right when you (55:20 - 55:23)
wake up (55:21 - 55:23)
but i i can't help but think of like (55:24 - 55:29)
okay these three pokemon that i invested (55:27 - 55:31)
in they're they're done they're garbage (55:29 - 55:32)
and (55:31 - 55:34)
what what's like is it's just ultra cup (55:32 - 55:36)
if great doesn't come back i don't want (55:34 - 55:38)
to play i don't want to play an ultra (55:36 - 55:39)
cup i don't want to play this (55:38 - 55:41)
isn't garbage (55:39 - 55:43)
they felt love (55:41 - 55:45)
you're right (55:43 - 55:50)
they appreciate their moment to shine (55:45 - 55:51)
um and then into the grinder give me my (55:50 - 55:53)
candies (55:51 - 55:55)
i will say like (55:53 - 55:57)
you know the the stuff that is for those (55:55 - 56:00)
special cups like jungle cup (55:57 - 56:01)
i don't really know what what the who (56:00 - 56:03)
those are for to be honest because like (56:01 - 56:05)
you have great league of ultra league of (56:03 - 56:07)
master league those repeat (56:05 - 56:08)
you know i still have pokemon that i (56:07 - 56:10)
powered up for great league initially (56:08 - 56:12)
like when it for when go battley first (56:10 - 56:13)
came out i still use them whenever (56:12 - 56:15)
greatly comes around that's the pokemon (56:13 - 56:17)
i use like and i do okay like i'm not (56:15 - 56:18)
i'm not like (56:17 - 56:19)
doing (56:18 - 56:20)
great and i'm not playing a whole lot (56:19 - 56:22)
because i usually just play to like (56:20 - 56:24)
complete tasks or whatever (56:22 - 56:26)
but those are still good i'm still using (56:24 - 56:28)
stuff that i picked before now the (56:26 - 56:29)
jungle cup and those like i don't know (56:28 - 56:31)
there's different cups that that come (56:29 - 56:32)
and go and i guess that's a little (56:31 - 56:33)
different but (56:32 - 56:34)
you know if you're using stuff for a (56:33 - 56:36)
great league like that's going to be (56:34 - 56:38)
back next season i mean you still have (56:36 - 56:41)
those those aren't gone um (56:38 - 56:42)
but (56:41 - 56:44)
i agree with greg in the sense of like (56:42 - 56:47)
it's it's boring to watch (56:44 - 56:48)
who like (56:47 - 56:51)
who like unless you're (56:48 - 56:53)
also i guess super in it like (56:51 - 56:55)
maybe but like for a general audience of (56:53 - 56:57)
people who are going to be at (56:55 - 56:59)
a tournament that's like four or four (56:57 - 57:01)
different uh types of pokemon i don't i (56:59 - 57:03)
just don't see the audience wanting to (57:01 - 57:05)
sit and watch that can i be a (57:03 - 57:06)
commentator (57:05 - 57:07)
oh (57:06 - 57:09)
steve that was a good tap like he's got (57:07 - 57:11)
excellent tapping technique oh look at (57:09 - 57:13)
that swish oh he's catching all those (57:11 - 57:14)
water drops look at him go oh whatever (57:13 - 57:16)
made excellent excellent what an (57:14 - 57:18)
excellent attack oh he didn't put up the (57:16 - 57:20)
shields can he serve oh this is like oh (57:18 - 57:21)
they're back to tapping look the furious (57:20 - 57:23)
tapping i can hear the tapping now i can (57:21 - 57:26)
feel my fingers twitch switch (57:23 - 57:28)
a play what a play he swapped oh he's (57:26 - 57:30)
tapping again look at that tap what an (57:28 - 57:32)
excellent tab he's doing that wouldn't (57:30 - 57:34)
be the only exciting part is oh he's (57:32 - 57:35)
swapped that's like literally what it (57:34 - 57:37)
comes down to is like (57:35 - 57:40)
every mat look i am sure there are some (57:37 - 57:42)
gbl lovers that are furious listening to (57:40 - 57:44)
this (57:42 - 57:47)
but at dragging a lake the reality is (57:44 - 57:50)
the reality is (57:47 - 57:50)
like (57:51 - 57:55)
it comes down to how you open (57:52 - 57:57)
and you you don't know it's there's no (57:55 - 57:59)
team preview like in vgc they have six (57:57 - 58:01)
pokemon i have six pokemon we're picking (57:59 - 58:03)
four what are we picking what four do i (58:01 - 58:05)
think can beat their six (58:03 - 58:06)
what four do i think they're bringing (58:05 - 58:08)
with with go battle league it's a flip (58:06 - 58:10)
of a coin (58:08 - 58:12)
like what do they lead with do they lead (58:10 - 58:14)
with something i'm good at (58:12 - 58:16)
or they lead with something i'm bad at (58:14 - 58:18)
or do they leave something neutral and (58:16 - 58:19)
then if they leave something neutral (58:18 - 58:21)
it's just it's just chicken who's (58:19 - 58:22)
switching first (58:21 - 58:24)
that's all it is yeah and whoever (58:22 - 58:26)
switches first at that point is probably (58:24 - 58:27)
gonna lose (58:26 - 58:28)
because they're gonna switch they're (58:27 - 58:29)
locked in and now you're just gonna (58:28 - 58:31)
switch the counter and you you win that (58:29 - 58:33)
now i get there's like more to it than (58:31 - 58:36)
that but this was the problem with the (58:33 - 58:38)
tcg (58:36 - 58:40)
and there were statistics to prove this (58:38 - 58:43)
if you went first in the tcg even if you (58:40 - 58:45)
had the worst deck you were 60 percent (58:43 - 58:47)
favored to win (58:45 - 58:48)
that was just it (58:47 - 58:52)
just going first bad deck or not you had (58:48 - 58:54)
an obvious advantage and that's why they (58:52 - 58:57)
had to change the the supporter rule and (58:54 - 58:59)
that's how it feels and go battling and (58:57 - 59:00)
i don't know if they have the stats but (58:59 - 59:02)
if you open good (59:00 - 59:04)
and they have to switch and you switch (59:02 - 59:05)
and then you switch because they're (59:04 - 59:07)
locked in (59:05 - 59:09)
you're unless you miss play (59:07 - 59:11)
you're you're fine (59:09 - 59:12)
or unless they have a hard counter that (59:11 - 59:14)
you didn't prep for um like again for me (59:12 - 59:16)
it would be like altaria i just don't (59:14 - 59:20)
have a pokemon for that but um (59:16 - 59:21)
i don't know (59:20 - 59:26)
i i see the light i see how go battle (59:21 - 59:27)
league is like (59:26 - 59:30)
i want to do more matches in jungle cup (59:27 - 59:31)
because i like (59:30 - 59:34)
it was easy to get into the pokemon (59:31 - 59:36)
selection was cute like ducklit i just (59:34 - 59:37)
want to remind everyone that ducklit's (59:36 - 59:39)
great uh (59:37 - 59:43)
but there's just so much that's like (59:39 - 59:45)
i will say this (59:43 - 59:47)
sometimes the light at the end of the (59:45 - 59:50)
tunnel is an oncoming train (59:47 - 59:50)
that's fair (59:51 - 59:53)
there's another one in my house you (59:52 - 59:55)
think i should catch that for the (59:53 - 59:57)
impossible never know it could matter as (59:55 - 60:00)
well and just save it you it's you know (59:57 - 60:02)
hope for the best maxed out so you can (60:00 - 60:05)
save them no i think like i agree though (60:02 - 60:06)
uh it (60:05 - 60:07)
i think there will be there will be (60:06 - 60:09)
changes over time like it's not gonna (60:07 - 60:12)
stay like this uh but it is what it is (60:09 - 60:15)
now and it seems pretty popular between (60:12 - 60:17)
for people and (60:15 - 60:19)
uh greg if you decide to do a (60:17 - 60:22)
sports commentary thing for steve you (60:19 - 60:24)
could start a twitch channel and where (60:22 - 60:25)
your twitch channel is watching steve's (60:24 - 60:28)
streams (60:25 - 60:28)
the new career you bet (60:31 - 60:36)
screen sniping (60:33 - 60:36)
um two more things uh the news before we (60:37 - 60:42)
wrap up number one very quick uh they (60:39 - 60:44)
put the very first episode of the (60:42 - 60:45)
pokemon anime on the official youtube (60:44 - 60:47)
channel (60:45 - 60:48)
um that was just kind of random that (60:47 - 60:50)
they did that the full episode just on (60:48 - 60:52)
youtube i mean obviously it was on (60:50 - 60:54)
pokemon tv (60:52 - 60:58)
but they uh threw it up on youtube i'm (60:54 - 61:00)
sure that is just hey we did the market (60:58 - 61:02)
research (61:00 - 61:04)
put it on youtube and it'll appear in (61:02 - 61:06)
the algorithm and people will be (61:04 - 61:07)
nostalgia for pokemon again i'm sure (61:06 - 61:10)

like i'm on the japanese website and (63:50 - 63:55)
it's not very clear i have a feeling (63:53 - 63:56)

world section where it's (63:56 - 64:02)
going to be like a couple of rides and (64:00 - 64:05)

during the tcg opening stream somebody (66:04 - 66:09)

podcast was like a long-term joke (66:09 - 66:14)
i didn't see that i'm like i mean it (66:12 - 66:15)
could be a joke we'll see what happens (66:14 - 66:17)

because (66:23 - 66:28)
i'm in a moving van uh (66:24 - 66:28)
let's see this is from matt (66:30 - 66:36)
if you had to pick if you had to pick a (66:34 - 66:38)
ghost type as your starter (66:36 - 66:40)
in a pokemon game which would you pick (66:38 - 66:42)
of course assuming that you would keep (66:40 - 66:46)
your starter from start to finish (66:42 - 66:48)
so ghost is a starter take it to the (66:46 - 66:52)
elite four what are we picking (66:48 - 66:52)
i feel like picking a non-evolving one (66:52 - 66:57)
is kind of cheating (66:54 - 66:59)
a non-evolving one yeah it's like (66:57 - 67:01)
mimikyu (66:59 - 67:03)
yeah mimikyu would be just good right or (67:01 - 67:06)
like staple it like i feel like (67:03 - 67:08)
the thing about starters is they have to (67:06 - 67:10)
evolve (67:08 - 67:12)
because that's like their deal (67:10 - 67:13)
they're like the they're like the three (67:12 - 67:15)
stager (67:13 - 67:16)
hm (67:15 - 67:17)
well i (67:16 - 67:20)
then if if we're thinking that i would (67:17 - 67:22)
i mean everyone loves gengar right so i (67:20 - 67:25)
think i would probably gasly would be (67:22 - 67:28)
would be up there for sure i am going to (67:25 - 67:30)
pick honedge (67:28 - 67:32)
is good that's a good one that's playing (67:30 - 67:35)
the game on easy mode though (67:32 - 67:37)
i want it's real good (67:35 - 67:40)
look i didn't say i was a bad trainer (67:37 - 67:43)
that's true (67:40 - 67:43)
oh my god you're good litwick (67:44 - 67:50)
is very good that's good yeah yeah (67:46 - 67:51)
i feel like it would be really really (67:50 - 67:55)
hard if you pick like a cursula (67:51 - 67:55)
uh shepard would be okay dust goal would (67:55 - 68:00)
be okay yeah (67:58 - 68:02)
okay (68:00 - 68:03)
um (68:02 - 68:04)
actually you know i take back all my (68:03 - 68:08)
answers i think yeah you know like um (68:04 - 68:10)
marshado would be (68:08 - 68:10)
no (68:10 - 68:12)
[Laughter] (68:10 - 68:14)
we ruled out non (68:12 - 68:16)
single form poke that was already stated (68:14 - 68:20)
that that could not be allowed (68:16 - 68:20)
dreepy anybody going drippy dripping oh (68:20 - 68:24)
drapey (68:23 - 68:26)
you know i used a drac cloak for the i (68:24 - 68:28)
used droopy drac cloak for the first (68:26 - 68:30)
time in uh sword and shield and it was (68:28 - 68:31)
it was awful (68:30 - 68:33)
like like drac cloak is not (68:31 - 68:36)
good until it gets to dragon ball (68:33 - 68:38)
it's real bad it's only level 60 for (68:36 - 68:41)
devol it's true yeah it's only level 50 (68:38 - 68:43)
for it to evolve the first time i don't (68:41 - 68:45)
know what your issue is (68:43 - 68:47)
grinds are for black and white right (68:45 - 68:51)
where everything takes a million levels (68:47 - 68:53)
that's where they introduced adino (68:51 - 68:55)
you just had oh yeah adidas gave you a (68:53 - 68:59)
50 million experience yeah (68:55 - 68:59)

times (70:14 - 70:17)
all right actual question of the week (70:19 - 70:23)
here uh from dustin from youtube what (70:20 - 70:25)
previously unused animal creature or (70:23 - 70:27)
object would you like to see in a gen 9 (70:25 - 70:31)
pokemon model after and what is it type (70:27 - 70:32)
you've done this because i've talked (70:31 - 70:34)
about the grass flamingo bobby was in (70:32 - 70:35)
here (70:34 - 70:37)
actually what's funny is i was here went (70:35 - 70:39)
like my first episode of doing this was (70:37 - 70:41)
when sword and shield was revealed and (70:39 - 70:43)
greg will and i did this we're like what (70:41 - 70:45)
kind of pokemon that haven't been (70:43 - 70:46)
animals that haven't well you were in (70:45 - 70:49)
japan steve but we got three scratch it (70:46 - 70:52)
crunchy dad you're out question gone (70:49 - 70:54)
wolf 11. do you think that there could (70:52 - 70:56)
be a ranger game for switch in the (70:54 - 70:58)
future (70:56 - 71:01)
i mean yeah anything's possible i mean (70:58 - 71:03)
the the thing about the ranger games is (71:01 - 71:05)
the touch screen was the selling point (71:03 - 71:07)
to make you drew circles (71:05 - 71:09)
and you can technically do that on the (71:07 - 71:11)
switch in handheld mode yeah and cafe (71:09 - 71:13)
mix draw circles (71:11 - 71:16)
i could see a ranger game on mobile (71:13 - 71:19)
before i see it on switch yeah um agreed (71:16 - 71:21)
that makes sense cause like i forgot my (71:19 - 71:23)
switch was touch screen to be completely (71:21 - 71:25)
honest like yeah i played doc so much (71:23 - 71:26)
that like i like picked it up and it (71:25 - 71:28)
accidentally like hit letters and i was (71:26 - 71:30)
like oh this thing's a touch screen i (71:28 - 71:32)
forgot about that yeah i will literally (71:30 - 71:33)
pull when i have to type something i (71:32 - 71:36)
will pull it out of the dock so i don't (71:33 - 71:37)
have to use the (71:36 - 71:39)
front around (71:37 - 71:42)
i feel like (71:39 - 71:43)
i mean i'm not against any new pokemon (71:42 - 71:45)
game i feel like you we were more likely (71:43 - 71:49)
get to get a pokey park 3 than a (71:45 - 71:52)
anything ranger related (71:49 - 71:52)
okay (71:53 - 71:57)
i just think we're heading back to (71:55 - 71:59)
diamond and pearl and ranger times (71:57 - 72:01)
and then maybe for that ranger mobile (71:59 - 72:03)
game this is true i wonder how happy (72:01 - 72:05)
they send me an email she's like look (72:03 - 72:07)
