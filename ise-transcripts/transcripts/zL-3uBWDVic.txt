to be fair you did start this before the 8 30 cut off we've already said absolutely not the plan before the cut-off if you make the plans before the cutoff it's fine i will show up i didn't have anything else to do on this glorious friday night you're getting your sunday your sunday is going to be free now my sunday's gonna be free now i can go grocery shopping and do nothing else sounds wonderful i can do brunch whenever i want oh will is not here he could not he we you know we we didn't text him early enough his cutoff was uh he is busy he has a life on a friday night unlike me i watched the disney haunted mansion special and the serious finale of ted lasso uh i'm still working through ted last so no spoilers [Laughter] anyways our own personal ted lasso bobby is here what oh man how's it going it's only 6 30 here so i've got that advantage it's nice and early it is my five year wedding anniversary today but uh other than that what are you doing perfect what are these life choices hey honey recording on friday pokemon time why are you here we also have two kids it's not like we're like going out on the town on a friday night i mean with that attitude you get a big winner bobby we went out today we went out today i took today off work we went out and had a had a day date so the old day date the old one of those in a while ah we're here to talk about pokemon what is there to talk about nothing happens i got two three four seven tabs greg you have seven tabs and two of them are gold [Laughter] all right let's just get right into things uh you know we're not gonna say this is gonna be a shorter episode because then we jinx ourselves we're just gonna you know get through it here you know friday night i'm trying to move trying to pack stuff got company over plow through this it'll be great we're gonna plow right through our first news article which is a distribution of dynamaxx crystals for gigantomax pikachu and gigantomax ev will be available at best buy uh from uh october 10th through the 24th whew the cars are just sitting sitting somewhere amongst video games oh absolutely or do i actually have to talk to somebody yeah i we that will be the news in itself will we talk to somebody yeah that's uh i have bought pokemon cards from best buy consistently for the last like eight months never walked in the store curbside pick up every single time you never need to even that free thing could just haul it out to my car please because greg what was it we were at mall of america and there was a distribution at gamestop yeah and they had it on the window so you didn't have to go in well they had one on the window and one inside because it was that it was the toxicity thing but there were two of them so he hit it twice yeah that was weird i ended up with like seven doctor city codes because of the way they had it set up um so those are out i mean like look people are continuing to buy sword and shield this coincides with the release of celebrations there's most i don't know if you're probably listening to this podcast you're probably like this is useless to me it's just it's just a regular old thick eevee and a regular old thick pikachu but it says crisp like is crystals meaning that you turn them in to get the actual crease yeah you use it's like a wishing piece that gets you they did this for copperage in europe yeah they've done it for a few pokemon throughout the last i've never actually i think when you even bought the game you got like larva didn't you get like it not larva larvitar and uh oh i believe oh what okay it was a lot of time eat them the soup you you're right yes you can what if they don't have the isle of armor though i don't have time for soup i got time for best buy pick up my cards okay the code literally getting the soup will take less time than driving to a best buy working through wherever scavenger hunt they hid the codes in their in their video game session which is now at the back between refrigerators and car stereos maybe this is big refrigerator maybe they're in the pockets of pokemon i mean best buy is desperate to get anybody into their stores that's true this is yet another look i will pick best buy any day of the week over gamestop how is that like a big statement it's like saying i will pick going to the mall of america to buy things instead of the dump i will not run around through garbage i will go to the mall of america like this is not a this is not a comparison that anybody takes yeah uh yeah speaking of distributions uh did you guys get yours a rude and your shiny celebrity email i got my email twice wow nice nice because i have because i doubled up out of fear my gmail and my regular my mac account both got it nice very happy i uh steve searching for something i'm looking for my light no continue talking ignore me for the youtube people they probably are very curious what's happening here we go what is he doing why um you get the slow liberator i uh i got mine and it is still sitting i made sure to keep it unread on my phone so that i don't forget to do the codes the problem here is this is the greg greg hold on before you before you you know what i'm going to say i know the problem okay for first off i already have the data zeroed in the shell sign it beef or the shell he's signing me what was that everything every celebrity is named shelley from now i have to nickname foreign uh shelley now that's that's gonna happen um so i have the ones from japan i think uh someone in the slack was able to get me there so i have them already but uh i i can't connect to the internet because i haven't done the alola starter oh dynamic or like uh rainbows and i still need to get some in luxury balls and stuff i can just try to have them in luxury balls oh i know i will breed you in luxury balls to make sure you do not forget to repeat your code catches pokemon let the man scavenger hunt in best buy come on it's about the thrill of the hunt no none of that is thrilling that's not that's not like the definition of not thrilling it's really not thrilling it's like a chorus i haven't done it yet but they were really not fun to catch in any ball it was awful right i guess that's yeah oh maybe okay we'll never mind well greg just send just traded me trade me in luxury balls i have the hidden abilities i did the work all weekend this is my gift to you ah thank you greg so i can just i can go ahead and download my my rude and my uh shelly plus i'm pretty sure there's like a giant spreadsheet and slack of everybody who has them in each type of ball i was supposed to be a part of that i totally didn't um speaking of dad as a rude and shiny celebi the movie is now out on netflix uh this is offpokemon.com secrets of the movie now out on netflix uh secrets of the movie [Laughter] some words together save some breath i'm not going to read the synopsis if you have netflix you're probably going to watch it i don't know if you don't want to watch it that's fine i understand look it has to be better than the power of us still haven't seen that based on your recommendation good good choices well done um i mean i'll hope it's better but yeah uh like anything pokemon related there's a million things happening this weekend movies out the celebrations tcg came out the rude codes went out that best buy thing started community day happening tomorrow we're recording this on a friday night not a sunday morning um i'm sure community was all it was fantastic wow again what a blessing um the fact that they rarely release shiny litwick hidden if you knew the code to do it that was the most impressive part really it was so scary when kecleon finally appeared it was a real halloween train was full of keklia and i thought surely this is a meltdown moment the pokemon tcg celebrations came out uh it was not planned for bobby to be on this episode but uh there is a bonus episode of bobby and i talking about the celebrations for um anyone who listens to premium feed so if you are curious about an hour of tcg talk specifically around celebrations um patreon.com pkmncast for five dollars you'll get two bonus episodes every month um this was the first this was actually the september episode uh so there'll be two more episodes this month one of them spoiler will be the movie thoughts of uh what irene and i watch eventually when we watch it this weekend hoping for tomorrow night and so yeah if you want to hear and support us on patreon that's where you can go more podcasts but uh greg you watched me open some packs right do you have any interest in said celebration um when did i i bailed out of that stream pretty early [Laughter] in there i saw you in there for at least a couple minutes i think i got my codes i got the email i'm like bye i gotta redeem my codes and do something more interesting with my life than watch you open packs wow wow celebrations though like you're not you're not like a tcg to see the big box because i was hoping it was at all exciting to me it wasn't i hung around to be polite and then i bailed you don't want some original blastoise charizard venusaur look i was there for farting pikachu do you don't want more farting pikachu no i mean you post it literally i've seen it on instagram i saw it on tick tock and i commented it every time here comes the chunky farting pikachu he's not farting it's a little dusty there there are two brown clouds coming from chunkachu's lower region that's true so you're saying that this is not a fun this doesn't seem fun to you to collect it's a small set only 50 cards no okay we talked about how i'm over collecting things and i don't need more stuff that is gonna sit in my head it's just gonna sit in my house and i'm gonna have to ask them and i ask you the most important question is there azalea in it and the answer was no there's you like lunala coyote gas a little gravity yes professor oak not my good professor oak not my top professor pikachu like seven times this is what i will say uh full disclosure the pokemon company international did send me that big package that we opened up on twitch if you missed the twitch it took me three hours to open all that mostly because i get distracted very easily um but we took the best of that and we cut it down to well there's be two parts first part's already up 20 minutes long that's the first 90 minutes i cut down to 20 minutes so that's on youtube uh i think it's worth watching i edited myself i thought look i edited myself it has to be good they just you know mwah rolls like your eyes will be happy if you youtube.com you put blah blah you you know where it is click the like and bell subscribe click like to comment your what you had for breakfast below uh i don't eat breakfast so that's there um were you two happy with the set yeah uh i think it's um i think it is a it is a cool set to collect like like here's what i'll say and i think i said this in the bonus podcast if you were to go in and buy like an etb of chilling rains you would make a very small indent into that whole set and you'd be lucky in that etb if you got like one full art if you got super lucky maybe like one full art a secret rare and you know maybe like two rares that's like unheard of i don't know what you're talking about an etv for the record is like eight packs but i feel like you could get away with buying like five packs and have a lot of the set already done and there's some exciting cards that you'd probably get in those five packs like it does feel like something where if they were easily available on shelves while you're checking out target it'd be like oh i heard about this yeah let's pick up a couple packs like i really do feel like that is something for somebody who doesn't collect the tcg versus what are you gonna do with five packs of children reigns there ain't no there ain't nothing like there ain't nothing really great in those these are really unless you really love calorics or horses just horses underestimate the horse fan contingency there are a lot of horse people out there i'm sure there are i'm sure there are um but yeah like i think chilling rain was 200 cards or something was the total plus the secret rares so that's talking like 230 or something oh yeah versus the 50 of this one and that was kind of that's funny back when detective pikachu came out they had that little mini set of detective pikachu with maybe like 30 cards i think and they had little four card packs as well and that actually got me like jumped into the back end of the tcg a little bit that little mini set because i was like oh i can collect these like maybe i can complete this set it's like 25 cards or something that might be fun uh didn't last unfortunately but you know i feel like that's kind of the same with this one just being a smaller set and i don't know if you've been around since the beginning times of pokemon and collected the cards back then it's a little you know a little bit of nostalgia as well since it's a lot of since there's a bunch of like classic cards and things like that so i don't know i'm happy with it i my stuff still hasn't arrived i pre-ordered a bunch of stuff from gamestop none of it is even shipped yet and yet i ordered two things from the pokemon center yesterday and they're supposed to be here tomorrow so i don't know what's going on with gamestop i don't know why it's taking them so long to get their act together but i still haven't opened anything and i'm slightly bummed about that what is going on with gamestop i don't think anyone can answer that question i think we've hinted towards the question let's do our pokemon unite minute here uh sylveon is now available in pokemon unite and got nerfed today oh i think i cut out there greg it came out on what the fifth wednesday they nerfed it today they cut damage down quick today real quick said quick nerf them fixed venusaur nah blastoise totally fine can shoot water across the entire map and stop you from doing anything sylveon can take like one pokemon down maybe two nerf it no i think so garbage like i was watching the the the high-end players you know the top ten people they play on the team or the top five people in unite playing a team and it was it was 20 plus kills every game it was unreal what they were doing i mean they're good right wait the top five unite players all are on the same team yeah that's okay i mean it's a team-based game it is but that's like that would be like if like the usa dream team was like all in the same nba like on the same basketball team or something instead of like within the nba like that seems unfair that just seems unfair i don't know like i get sports analogies it kind of made sense i mean they haven't fixed the other stuff it was fine do a big balance plan let people enjoy sylveon for a week you have not fixed the petal dance garbage of venusaur i mean maybe there may have barely done anything for blastoise but this cute wonderful thing can can be in the sunlight for two days and then you nerf it into the ground yeah it seems weird that it was so quick because it that makes it seem like the data that came back within 24 hours maybe was like showed something was wrong with it i mean i'm telling you people were rocking it on the the matches i watched i was like jeez they were like in a situation where it's cramerant versus bees i feel like i'm working hard even if i'm like level 12 i'm like i gotta work these bees you guys gotta give me a moment i'm still i'm struggling over here and then like with sylveon it was like like a roomba on the first day working amazingly like just sucking up those bees instantly and we're not talking about like a three year old room but you know that thing's struggling out there but we're talking about like fresh out of the box well this this was 600 bucks that sylvia was working um i don't know like i don't feel like blastoise has been a problem since they fixed the like bugs that blast always had like the fixing the bug took like a week and a half yeah that's true and sylveon they're like nope two days nerf it garbage this is garbage choices also you're right they haven't done anything about venusaur but peddled it like venusaur's pedal dance is unreal it is it lasts like eight seconds and then it's like two seconds and then you get it again for another eight seconds because it's the countdown doesn't start over again after the move ends the countdown starts when you use the move the move lasts six seconds the countdown is eight so when it ends two seconds and you fire it up again it's like the most ridiculous amount of time oh and you can't outrun that thing either he's not outright he's hustling i don't run that thing it's a hustle and frog it is so overpowered and they're like oh it's fine but you're gonna look at sylvian who is doing hey sylvia was out there working she was she was she was doing it look okay so hyper voice could do 6 000 points of damage big deal let get your money i mean they fixed hyper voice fixed mystical player maybe they got their money and they saw like a huge spike of like oh people aren't buying anymore so now if that's then what about blastoise people aren't buying blasphemous meanwhile mammo swine is out there trying to work man got done dirty by these developers you don't see us urgent fixed that nah sylveon's out there represent the trans community doing the work nerfed nerfed into the ground almost unplayable you know wow [Laughter] mama swine is something they exist i am so took two buffs to get where he's at and they still don't know what they're doing with charizard they just keep pumping charizard and everybody still picks charizard because it's the favorite um i'm sure i'm sure i'm sure they'll fix mammals one um you know maybe one day maybe one day yeah who knows yeah but sylvia can't exist out there being loud and proud and taking monsters down now waiting for the 40 mammal swine skin i was gonna does does sylveon have a uh no no they have a normal like five dollar skin okay okay a regularly priced now nerfed skin it's like a little rain coat it's kind of cute yeah okay it's fine i was actually i thought it was just gonna be like sylveon from the start oh yeah that's what i thought i was like what this is gonna get complicated if they introduce the other ones right i was gonna say sylveon's the first evolution right yeah so who cares about the other ones i mean sylveon is the best one am i wrong there are okay jolteon folk it's at dragging a lake uh you can also send emails that he will ignore to the podcast or whatever it's very true direct your rage there i am out of this i think they wanted to make money right would they already learn from build-a-bear you put a flare on the shelf no one's buying it like i didn't say flareon i said jolteon jojo's the popular one yeah well i thought people no no the popular ones are espn and umbreon i was going to say umbreon there's umbreon yeah esprion's just out there being weird got two tails speaking of sylveon there's a dark sylveon in the tcg not to be confused with darkness type greg darkness type is the dark energy what makes it dark dark would mean that it was trained by team rocket like dark dragonite dark charizard you remember those cards back in the day yeah but it can't be that bad because sylveon evolves with friendship it's a it's a pouty silver it's a pretty cool card actually it's a pouty sylvia yeah it's very pouty it's cool it's cool you should look it up dark on celebration i see this full art one and it's just not it's not facing the front i don't know yeah yeah but it's pouty how is that pouty he's got his back to you it's just not exactly it's not friendly to you because you're judging it about being dark it's trying to live its best life trying to nuke people on the field and you come in two days later call it dark and nerf it that yeah that's that is exactly what happened uh speaking for part of the course pokemon evolutions episode three is out the visionary watch that i have not watched it but i have been told i've heard it's not good that it does not answer any of the questions that were happening in x and y i'm looking at the screenshot here i see i see a xerneas in the screenshot i see uh i see lysander and i see a mega gyarados um so i expect to see the virtual boy on lysander at some point of the plot lines i don't feel like there were a lot of questions left in x and y yeah there was why is tiarano at my parade like get out of here man because you're best friends no who is your dance instructor he did not follow me down into the the dark pits to battle pitbull and then to battle lysander with a virtual boy also why does az think it's okay to do a battle during my parade because you are a champion and you are supposed to accept challenges whenever they happen he should wherever happened with getting a job because he was in prison for like two years and he probably doesn't have any income you are there to help him get back into society you have abandoned him well he can whatever until i get to the top and get my trust at the end of that game bothers me so much did get in the top you're in the middle of your parade all of the stuff that happened you've already been declared champion at that point your obligation would you stop santa mid-parade no yes if santa was my next challenge to become a champion of the region you bet i'm saying pull over it is time to throw down fat man let's go all right everybody put it that way maybe i changed my mind yeah you bet change your mind look i love x and y i say it all the time but man that story sucks it's bad yes you never say that i like it cause and why i like xmi you like it you don't love it see that is not a love reaction i like x and y more than i like omega ruby yeah because you're right you like everything more than omega ruby alphabet you like gamestop more than omega ruby apples on fire that's no let's not go let's not take things let's not say things we can't take back um well that's out that's out uh and then in another two weeks we'll get the black and white storyline because they're going backwards let's count down um speaking of counting down let's count down to a break uh and when we come back we will talk about some more pokemon stuff figure that out during the break pokemon stuff maybe we'll change midstream what this podcast is abundance dance [Music] dance abundance abundance [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] and we are back from our break all right we got we i saved the good news here i said the good news the 20 well first good news the 2022 championship series kicks off soon and it includes pokemon go what what do you mean what yes what uh pokemon premiere events are returning in early 2022 complete for prizes travel awards and glory with four different ways to play pokemon tcg pokemon video game pokken tournament dx that's still alive and for the first time pokemon go as already announced some players will age up to the new age divisions for 2022 can you imagine you were like top of your class and then the pandemic happened and now all of a sudden you're in master rank and now you're over there yeah i can't imagine it's called my life all players who earned points in the 2020 season which was cancelled in march of 2020 will have their points transferred to the 2022 season players attending pokemon tournaments will be required to comply with pokemon's covid policies which mandates that all participants must be vaccinated for more information about play pokemon covid19 policies they can be found here this is off pokemon.com by the way information is subject to change based on government health mandates and participants should check with their organizers for the most up-to-date information prizes and champion point schedules for each event series for the 2022 season will mostly uh mirror the one the stuff that was already established in the 2020 season since 2022 is a shorter season than usual players will only be able to earn travel awards for the 2022 north american championships based on points they've earned during the period from when the championship championship events began through april 24th 2022 this is like really through the european championships that are taking place in 2022 there will be no travel award because travel awards and stipends which were provided to all players okay here i'll this is if you gotta if you got travel reward back then you still will have it for the 2022. if you somehow qualify in 2022 no travel award that's easy um pokken tournament dx returns to worlds 2022. players have already got the same travel reward stuff um okay skip into this pokemon go for the first time ever pokemon go players can partake in a play pokemon event with the first very official pokemon go championship series it's very i know it because they said it now i know what you're thinking they had pokemon go at the dc world that was an invitational it was invite only it was like masuda i think was one of the people in that tournament and he used the psyduck um that was it was like very cute and it was i don't want to be negative but watching a bunch of people play early gbl on stage at worlds and realizing how slow gbl kind of is sometimes not the most entertaining thing to watch no not at all [Laughter] so is it going to be the gbl at i can answer some of those questions for you to register for the pokemon go championship series of events you must be your home region's age uh digital consent or older you also need to have a linked pokemon go account to your trainer club account have a player id opt-in to play terms of use and the ability to create the ability to create an account and link will be available in late 2021 registration for the first time will open in january so just to clarify here if you made a pokemon go account back in the day you either picked google or trainer club you tried to pick trainer club remember it was broken for like the first like month correct [Laughter] and since then you could link it but that linking isn't working right now for the play pokemon stuff so they're gonna fix that before the end of the year but theoretically what i would recommend too is you can like link your pogo to like more than one email you do like gmail and then you could do like either facebook or your apple um id or like one other thing yeah that's apple facebook google and pokemon trainer club you should do two of those is what i'm saying at least i mean if nothing else like facebook two days ago showed us that anybody who needed to log in with facebook to couldn't play pokemon go the other day either yeah period of time so definitely you should probably do two of those just in case one goes down um additionally as previously announced access to early registration will be granted to pokemon go players who perform well in go battle league for the first batch of invites players much must achieve legend rank in season 9 in order to qualify details for later events will be added once the corresponding go battle league season is announced tournaments for pokemon go will operate seniors and masters division and will run the great league format that's actually really great no pun intended for specific uh format details stay tuned to the rules and documents will be available soon to ensure an even playing field participants at most qualifiers will be re required to log into their go account and to battle using a smart devices provided on site if this is not this is not the case for specific events the organizers will announce that separately okay so a lot of things here number one is they said four games competing tcg video game series pokken pokemon go there's no word of unite i bet they're gonna do the thing that they did with pokemon go unite is going to be an invitational this 2022 they're going to find like four of the best teams they're going to like showcase it because those are highly skilled players and then they're going to set it up for anyone to be able to play for 2023 that would be my bet there is no way we somebody write down the time stamp there is no way at the 2022 world championships there will not be unite up on that stage in some capacity that's a bold prediction i mean i guess i guess it makes sense i mean they have really uh they're really going all with it for unite right now so and it doesn't seem to well i don't know does is it is it losing steam at all i mean unite like it it's got they had that initial bump for sure is it i think it did what i thought it was going to do which is be mediocrity popular in the united states and be incredibly popular in in asia and it is like if you watch korean streamers or japanese streamers or um here this is really hard to explain but let me try to explain it if you watch anyone from an asian country and you just watch them long enough you'll see that their matches are so varied and so different you watch an american streamer you'll see like the same names pop up constantly like like oh like i just played this dude two games ago like the it seems that the player pool for the american servers are so much smaller than the player pools in other countries and obviously you want to try to match to people closer to you for lag and stuff but maybe maybe i'm jaded but that's my experience at least with it interesting i i don't know i am still stuck on are people actually gonna stand on stage with their smartphones in hand to play go battle league which is just tapping the phone and hitting one button sometimes too sometimes there's two charge moves down there and then swiping that that's that's the thing they're doing hey people play poker that has choices you have choices in battle yeah but the choices sure you have like one choice in battle but most of those are done before the battle starts you have two choices okay yeah i'm not disagreeing with you i just cannot fathom sitting in the audience when anything else could be going on to watch static animations on a giant screen and two people not like writing things down or trying to decide if they're gonna switch out literally tapping a screen and then moving slightly to hit a button there is okay i i i'm not trying to defend anything it is the wildest thing i've heard like i thought like it's hey we're going to release a bun it's like a bug contest try to catch the most rare thing catch the highest ep that would be cool that would be interesting like run around do something the battle system in pokemon go is the most boring part of that game it's pretty bad i and you're gonna put it on a stage okay i'm going to say some stuff before i say it i want to say that i agree with everything rick just said i do agree with greg i do i do have some more things to add so i was looking through my costume collection in pokemon go there's a costume decks i think there's like 102 costumes total or something like that and i have 92 of them so i'm missing like the flower happy knee i'm missing a couple of raichu's which i have i just have to evolve them and then i realized oh costume pokemon yeah got it okay not like avatar style stuff yeah yeah the the pokemon the costume pokemon decks got it and i realize i'm missing pikachu libre uh which you can only get through go battle league now like two seasons ago i think it was season seven they made it really easy to get but i didn't i don't care about go battle league and i missed that opportunity now in go battle league if you want pikachu libre you have to get to like rank 20 or something it's very high like 20 24 i don't know something like that five or something like that yeah it's like you can get it from omega ruby and alpha sapphire that's true or i could maybe trade somebody for it yes all possible things but so so i'm looking i'm looking so i'm sitting here playing pokemon go on twitch it was spotlight hour a quick aside there are some people that still don't know spotlight hours just a thing that exists every tuesday from six to seven local time it's it's it's existed before the pandemic it's been around for a while this is my only time frame is when the pandemic started and what features were added and not happening because it's been like 50 years um so we're like doing spotlight hour and then i'm like oh i don't have the pikachu libre cause i'm like looking at things i'm missing and then i like click on go battle league and it says like ultra cup ultra cup whatever and then it says little jungle cup and i was like i'm out i'm not interested in anything that isn't great league because ultra cup you got to spend on you gotta chop off your arm and then cash it in for stardust like no way am i doing in the ultra you have to have like half deoxys stardust that's true you have to have like deoxys from like 2003 specifically caught at this lake park over here and like it has to be in defense form and it has to have like three attack and 50 like you have to have the most complicated thing in the world for ultra cup whatever that's where the pros are the people who know and the only and if you want to even play in master cup you got to get like a brazilian dialga that's 15 15 15 and then you got to make it your best bud and then you gotta i'm out this is all whatever and then okay so i see little jungle cup i'm like what is this and they're like 500 cp this sounds great 500 that's one third of 1500 cp i'm in so i i go to google smash on my keyboard hold on for the for the smash on my keyboard here and i i type jungle cup teams and the first team said ducklit and i was like i'm all in ducklit i love ducklit i can get behind a team with ducklit on it i was like cool so i go back to pokemon go i type in ducklit i have two because why would you have more than two ducklit you would be like i have too many ducklit well just throw them away which is what i do in pokemon go i for some reason had 36 gallerian ponyta so what i did is i just randomly picked 30 of them and was like goodbye and now i have six so i have two ducklit and i was like okay they're both under 500 cp so i did the thing of like plus the cp to see how close they would get to 500 and one of them got to like 4.96 and i was like okay well that's as good as we're getting right we can't go above 500. otherwise disqualified so i was like i put aside the ducklit i'm looking at the list they're recommending all these pokemon and they were like chansey i was like okay chansey ducklit i think i understand what they're going for i'd like go over type in chancy i have one chansey happens to be exactly 500 cp though so i'm over the moon i'm like this is perfect and then the last one was show i decided i was like oh let me try shellmet right type in shellmet i got two shelmets and i they're both under 500 so i do the little plus thing and one of the shelmets can get to 500 cp and i was like this is great this is great i mean there's lots of other pokemon you know cottony and what you know zubat you know these pokemon i was like i'm gonna go all in i'm gonna teach them all second moves i'm the power of them up i've i spent 254 000 stardust quarter of a million stardust because you second moves or 50 000 stardust for maybe for what chansey no no all of them well chansey was like 75 000 or something one was 75 the other two were 50. i don't remember which one okay so i did the second moves power powered up the cps did all that stuff quarter of a million started us to get here now i want to pre i want a preference preference preface breakfast preface i want to preface that i hate go battling but i don't hate it because i'm bad at it i think i'm relatively decent at it um is it permit it's hitting the screen yeah i know it's interesting and you're a cookie clicker champ from trims so long story short i'm i don't know what hold on i can't remember the record long story short i agree with everything greg said but i've experienced it firsthand i don't understand i really don't i'm trying to i'm trying to like you know stand in these people's shoes but the amount of stardust and the amount of time and like me just being lucky enough to have ducklit and if i'm thinking like junk go battle league is he's here i wanna let's say i'm like a hardcore pokemon go battler and oh you can't catch ducklit right now where are you supposed to get a ducklit you want a chansey good luck finding a chansey in the wild like it's dumbfounding to me that a competitive pokemon go player has to just like constantly check every pokemon they catch not like the like check the three star or four star they have to like check it of can this get to 500 or 1500 or whatever it is because it's not perfect perfect perfect it's like oh the attack has to be three and the defense the hp and the what defense has to be 15. it's like such a weird system to get like i understand like the lower the attack the like smaller increments the cp goes up and that's what actually matters um but what if i didn't have any like what if i didn't have ducklit what if i didn't like what if i didn't have these pokemon i mean yeah i guess i built another team but then i have to have all the stardust to then power it up and i have to have the candy and i have to like because you have to have the candy to do the move with the stardust so i caught enough ducklit obviously to have the ducklit candy and then i'm thinking about this and i'm like okay on october 10th these three pokemon are useless they're done they i gave them all second moves i powered them up and they're they're garbage they're done now before anyone is like well in the video game the the you know your old competitive pokemon are are you're right they are but i also don't have to spend eight hours outside catching the same pokemon over and over to then cash it in like i mean what some people would say like you get to go outside for eight hours nobody says that nobody's happy about that they clearly want you to live in the game right i mean that's the whole point like having to do these checks having to like do all of that keeps you looking at the game it keeps you in there longer like you don't get to do the whole i'm just gonna catch a few things see if they're good like you know three stars or whatever and leave now i get to do all this and i have to grind this out and i have to do that like they want you to do that and they clearly like whether people do it or not i don't know i mean it seems like it's pretty popular uh i mean the go battle league seems pretty popular and so people are doing it people are living in the game they're giving them the money they need for the stardust costs and the stardust pieces or star pieces and they're trading with people and you know making it happen so this is early pokemon problems right like right like this is like the gen 3 probably all over again gen 2 and be like at the time we loved the breeding system now it is awful like because people are interacting with it now because they have no other other choice like this is how the game was built does not mean that's good or fun like the like the grind is only acceptable because it's technically a new game yeah like it's been five years and go battle like it it is still just tapping the screen yeah okay and i i agree with both of you i don't like the go battling at all i have not done it in multiple seasons now like i do want to get the did you get the libre pikachu steve no okay so i'm ranked 10. no i'm i've done all this and i have not received an award i am rank 10 i have done 46 battles i have won 34 of them and i won 12 battles in a row so again i want to say that i don't think i'm particular like obviously my win ratio very good right now um i don't think i'm awful i go battling i think i've made some mistakes a lot of my losses in go battle league like you it is just like in vgc sometimes it's just imp you have three pokemon there are like 40 pokemon in jungle cup that you can pick from so like every like out of my 12 losses or however many that is yeah 34 plus 12 is 46. out of my 12 losses i think half of them were against um like altaria teams i can't beat altaria it just it's an auto lease for me unless they miss play i just lose and that's okay like my team can clearly beat almost every other team here like i'm good if all zarya shows and then you of course you got somebody in twitch chat they're like well maybe you should change your team for altaria yeah well then i'll lose to something else like there is not a single team that can beat everything that's that's pokemon right that's pokemon um so i'm i'm good i'm good with the team i like my team i lead with ducklit i like ducklit i'm able to use a pokemon i like i want to just let's go let's back up a second 500 cp a quarter of a million stardust what the the time investment the amount of candy you need and stardust you need and catching the same pokemon you need for ultra or master is just what why would and let's say let's say that that grind didn't exist let's say like you're okay with the grind go battle league is the laggiest unforgiving frustrating game in the entire world imagine grinding like three months for like a perfect dialga and then the game just lags out and you're like i click i tap the button four times and they're going first i don't i i can't tap any harder um if i would have went first i would have won but clearly the game decided i didn't tap first it's it's a very frustrating experience i will say i've had fun with it like you know i had fun with it because of the low commitment that the game had me had me do i happened to have the right pokemon it was a low barrier to entry greg is right i'm starter stress rich it doesn't like the stardust thing is like not that big of a deal but even though i've had fun with the jungle cup like it's still a barrier to entry to so many people to be like do you have these pokemon nope you don't oh you you do have cottony but they're all over 500. oh it's too bad can't use it you throw away all your zubats sorry sucks like i i i don't know what the better situation is but it feels like the grind and or money that you put into the game is not worth the actual it feels like hey you want to play chess cool go out to the woods and whittle some pieces because like well that's what true masters do they become one of the sets like i don't want to worry about pieces like i don't i want to play the chess game of then download the app here's the thing like what there are usually it's pokemon company they're usually not great safeguards for people to do shenanigans on getting the pokemon they need like it is problem i still think i'm still stuck on the fact that they expect an audience to sit and watch this because i watched you play and i lasted about 20 minutes before i'm like i could be doing anything else with my life i could be asleep hey there was some sick plays though yeah listen you complained i hit heavy i hit it i had it and it didn't accept it i heavy slammed that's pretty much yeah that's that's the game in the nuts first off it was body slam thank you very much um think i think there's potential there for go battling in the sense that like matches are quick like that's why i liked clash royale and i think that's why you like clash royale greg like you're you're you're probably going to be there to two to three minutes if it goes into overtime overtime's only an extra minute yeah it's in and out and you're done right and i get that for the normal video game or for the tcg those matches can go way way over 10 minutes how i don't know what the timer is in sword and shield whenever i think the timer's 15 maybe but those those matches can be long and so it's nice to be able to get like a three four minute match in like right before bed or right when you wake up but i i can't help but think of like okay these three pokemon that i invested in they're they're done they're garbage and what what's like is it's just ultra cup if great doesn't come back i don't want to play i don't want to play an ultra cup i don't want to play this isn't garbage they felt love you're right they appreciate their moment to shine um and then into the grinder give me my candies i will say like you know the the stuff that is for those special cups like jungle cup i don't really know what what the who those are for to be honest because like you have great league of ultra league of master league those repeat you know i still have pokemon that i powered up for great league initially like when it for when go battley first came out i still use them whenever greatly comes around that's the pokemon i use like and i do okay like i'm not i'm not like doing great and i'm not playing a whole lot because i usually just play to like complete tasks or whatever but those are still good i'm still using stuff that i picked before now the jungle cup and those like i don't know there's different cups that that come and go and i guess that's a little different but you know if you're using stuff for a great league like that's going to be back next season i mean you still have those those aren't gone um but i agree with greg in the sense of like it's it's boring to watch who like who like unless you're also i guess super in it like maybe but like for a general audience of people who are going to be at a tournament that's like four or four different uh types of pokemon i don't i just don't see the audience wanting to sit and watch that can i be a commentator oh steve that was a good tap like he's got excellent tapping technique oh look at that swish oh he's catching all those water drops look at him go oh whatever made excellent excellent what an excellent attack oh he didn't put up the shields can he serve oh this is like oh they're back to tapping look the furious tapping i can hear the tapping now i can feel my fingers twitch switch a play what a play he swapped oh he's tapping again look at that tap what an excellent tab he's doing that wouldn't be the only exciting part is oh he's swapped that's like literally what it comes down to is like every mat look i am sure there are some gbl lovers that are furious listening to this but at dragging a lake the reality is the reality is like it comes down to how you open and you you don't know it's there's no team preview like in vgc they have six pokemon i have six pokemon we're picking four what are we picking what four do i think can beat their six what four do i think they're bringing with with go battle league it's a flip of a coin like what do they lead with do they lead with something i'm good at or they lead with something i'm bad at or do they leave something neutral and then if they leave something neutral it's just it's just chicken who's switching first that's all it is yeah and whoever switches first at that point is probably gonna lose because they're gonna switch they're locked in and now you're just gonna switch the counter and you you win that now i get there's like more to it than that but this was the problem with the tcg and there were statistics to prove this if you went first in the tcg even if you had the worst deck you were 60 percent favored to win that was just it just going first bad deck or not you had an obvious advantage and that's why they had to change the the supporter rule and that's how it feels and go battling and i don't know if they have the stats but if you open good and they have to switch and you switch and then you switch because they're locked in you're unless you miss play you're you're fine or unless they have a hard counter that you didn't prep for um like again for me it would be like altaria i just don't have a pokemon for that but um i don't know i i see the light i see how go battle league is like i want to do more matches in jungle cup because i like it was easy to get into the pokemon selection was cute like ducklit i just want to remind everyone that ducklit's great uh but there's just so much that's like i will say this sometimes the light at the end of the tunnel is an oncoming train that's fair there's another one in my house you think i should catch that for the impossible never know it could matter as well and just save it you it's you know hope for the best maxed out so you can save them no i think like i agree though uh it i think there will be there will be changes over time like it's not gonna stay like this uh but it is what it is now and it seems pretty popular between for people and uh greg if you decide to do a sports commentary thing for steve you could start a twitch channel and where your twitch channel is watching steve's streams the new career you bet screen sniping um two more things uh the news before we wrap up number one very quick uh they put the very first episode of the pokemon anime on the official youtube channel um that was just kind of random that they did that the full episode just on youtube i mean obviously it was on pokemon tv but they uh threw it up on youtube i'm sure that is just hey we did the market research put it on youtube and it'll appear in the algorithm and people will be nostalgia for pokemon again i'm sure that was it's canto month right like this yeah in this countdown of months that they're doing no but like you've seen the pokemon tweets and everything like each month they're doing and you know the tcg obviously we have the big jumbo cards every month but october is canto month so this is like the and you know with the 25th anniversary tcg coming out like so it kind of makes sense to have to have thrown up that first episode iconic that first iconic pokemon episode and the last bit of news um is off the softpolygon.com universal studios will bring pokemon to its japan theme park universal studios theme park in japan will be adding a pokemon attraction to the park uh they shared this in a press release the pokemon company and universal shared in a press release on wednesday beginning in 2022 the two companies will enter a long-term partnership to explore a new entertainment to immerse park guests into the world of pokemon new attractions will combine real and virtual experiences to create a revolutionary park experience um here's a quote pokemon is beloved but beloved by fans around the world we are honored to have a long-term partnership with the pokemon company while developing groundbreaking pokemon entertainment at universal studio japan for both pokemon fans and guests jl bonnie bonier president ceo of universal japan said in a statement the release did not comment on any specific plans for rides or experiences for guests pokemon won't oh and then they talk about nintendo world my hope is this this is full jurassic park they are mutating animals to become pokemon and then it all breaks out but they're all female pokemon because they don't want anybody know what but the ditto got in there at all it was the dead nature finds a way uh is this so is this supposed to be like um out here in in la they the universal studios they have like a harry potter world like it's like one whole portion of the park is now harry potter themed you can go to like get butter beer and you can go to different ways i thought there was one in like florida too there is there's oh there's two there's one in l.a there's one out here in l.a and um and it's like a whole section of the park is harry potter themed it's not just like one attraction it's it's like a whole world of harry potter in the park is that the plan there i mean i know they said they didn't mention objections but they don't say like i'm on the japanese website and it's not very clear i have a feeling it's gonna be a lot like the nintendo world section where it's going to be like a couple of rides and then a lot of statues right right okay yeah i mean it's cool yeah i mean if i'd go yeah definitely i don't see i don't see why not i mean we we we we are due for our trip to japan greg business expense business expenses you you have to run it through for your taxes richie rich that's right gotta gotta bring those loopholes in so buy me a ticket let's go we'll go find good pizza in japan well i had pizza japan it was very bad in japan it was very good i don't know what you're talking about you're going to the wrong pizza place in japan clearly look when it said chicago deep dish pizza and i was in japan i was like i need to know what that tastes like one nope chicago deep dish is not good pizza what oh no it's like eating a pie it's eating like two meals i just walked into that it's like a lot of dough and very little payoff we're not talking about go battling here we ended that moved on from go battle league it's a chicago pizza a lot of dough little payoffs that'll pay off i like the way we're ending the show uh craig question of the week cause i want the question of the week um oh i lost the attic channel ah brandon sending in the uh lysander stuff spencer sending in the um pikachu eevee stuff thank you guys in the attic channel for that uh miles sent in that there's a giant swablu in pokemon center let's just mention that that's cute how much is it 40 bucks oh yeah that's not bad i was thinking it was like 300. you can add that to your growing collection nothing's getting added until i move also during the tcg opening stream somebody thought that me mentioning moving on the podcast was like a long-term joke i didn't see that i'm like i mean it could be a joke we'll see what happens when you get here i'm actually moving if there's an episode in the next couple weeks that i'm not suddenly on it's probably because i'm in a moving van uh let's see this is from matt if you had to pick if you had to pick a ghost type as your starter in a pokemon game which would you pick of course assuming that you would keep your starter from start to finish so ghost is a starter take it to the elite four what are we picking i feel like picking a non-evolving one is kind of cheating a non-evolving one yeah it's like mimikyu yeah mimikyu would be just good right or like staple it like i feel like the thing about starters is they have to evolve because that's like their deal they're like the they're like the three stager hm well i then if if we're thinking that i would i mean everyone loves gengar right so i think i would probably gasly would be would be up there for sure i am going to pick honedge is good that's a good one that's playing the game on easy mode though i want it's real good look i didn't say i was a bad trainer that's true oh my god you're good litwick is very good that's good yeah yeah i feel like it would be really really hard if you pick like a cursula uh shepard would be okay dust goal would be okay yeah okay um actually you know i take back all my answers i think yeah you know like um marshado would be no [Laughter] we ruled out non single form poke that was already stated that that could not be allowed dreepy anybody going drippy dripping oh drapey you know i used a drac cloak for the i used droopy drac cloak for the first time in uh sword and shield and it was it was awful like like drac cloak is not good until it gets to dragon ball it's real bad it's only level 60 for devol it's true yeah it's only level 50 for it to evolve the first time i don't know what your issue is grinds are for black and white right where everything takes a million levels that's where they introduced adino you just had oh yeah adidas gave you a 50 million experience yeah um youtube if you're listening on youtube you can leave a comment we'll answer it for the next time hit the like hit the subscribe button hey i'm gonna answer this for orange wolf it's not the question though uh do you think they'll ever release a 3ds ds pokemon game no they already said they're done they said ultrasound ultramoon was the last game also the 3ds is like 11 years old let it die it's fine well the 3ds is not being manufactured anymore yeah it's they've let it the company has let it die it came out in 2011. no i think i was still using a motorola razer or something when that no i was not into iphone world dude hey i didn't get the first couple iphones i couldn't afford that you weren't working at apple um i was there after the i think i was there for the 3gs launch oh okay i'm a couple years before you then yeah got it um i was there for the first launch of iphone but they wouldn't let employees of my company purchased them i yes i remember this actually it was erased from my memory you just brought it back horrible times horrible times all right actual question of the week here uh from dustin from youtube what previously unused animal creature or object would you like to see in a gen 9 pokemon model after and what is it type you've done this because i've talked about the grass flamingo bobby was in here actually what's funny is i was here went like my first episode of doing this was when sword and shield was revealed and greg will and i did this we're like what kind of pokemon that haven't been animals that haven't well you were in japan steve but we got three scratch it crunchy dad you're out question gone wolf 11. do you think that there could be a ranger game for switch in the future i mean yeah anything's possible i mean the the thing about the ranger games is the touch screen was the selling point to make you drew circles and you can technically do that on the switch in handheld mode yeah and cafe mix draw circles i could see a ranger game on mobile before i see it on switch yeah um agreed that makes sense cause like i forgot my switch was touch screen to be completely honest like yeah i played doc so much that like i like picked it up and it accidentally like hit letters and i was like oh this thing's a touch screen i forgot about that yeah i will literally pull when i have to type something i will pull it out of the dock so i don't have to use the front around i feel like i mean i'm not against any new pokemon game i feel like you we were more likely get to get a pokey park 3 than a anything ranger related okay i just think we're heading back to diamond and pearl and ranger times and then maybe for that ranger mobile game this is true i wonder how happy they send me an email she's like look for it i wonder how happy they are with the mystery dungeon dx sales that came that game came and went all mystery dungeon games come and win come and go like there's a core group of people who love them bless ya it's your favorite thing great but they're they have never been big splashes yeah there's always like the they do the thing they get a lot of chitter chatter though when mystery dungeon comes out it's the same song and dance it's like well maybe this is the one and you're like oh no i didn't change it it's the same thing i mean people love what they love and when they have a a small nugget of hope they're going to carry it yeah flame uh no pokemon the week that's that's will's thing we we're not gonna step on his toes also i can't remember what it was i didn't write anything down so it was perfect well you guys got a whole other week to figure it out this is brian this week it's samuel perfect hey uh thank you for listening thanks for making it to the end sorry it's a little bit short i we said maybe a little bit shorter ended up being a little bit shorter so thank you for hanging out a little bit we're saying a little bit we are like 15 minutes less what no no we had a two-hour episode last week yeah but average is an hour and a half that's true our average is an hour and a half um will always takes you know 20 minutes on that pokemon of the week just easy to cut he's just rambling and rambling thanks for breaking to the end most of the things that he didn't matter what he says i for for what it's worth will if you're listening i appreciate you and i appreciate your pokemon he will but it's his thing like the 17 clues at the start are red herrings to throw you off there's like two words spelled backwards in the middle of the last few sentences that say the name of the pokemon like he's very clever but i'm telling you right now ignore the first part of everyone he says which means the next time he writes one it's all gonna be front loaded this is how this works you won't believe the
