[Music] (0:16 - 0:22)
what's up everyone welcome to the first (0:24 - 0:31)
episode of the super picnic club I'm (0:27 - 0:33)
your host Steve that's the the episode (0:31 - 0:36)
series is called super picnic Club oh is (0:33 - 0:40)
it what a way to learn wow what could we (0:36 - 0:44)
have maybe workshopped the name no no I (0:40 - 0:46)
said so much time (0:44 - 0:49)
here's the problem you spent so much (0:46 - 0:51)
time to come up with a bad name had you (0:49 - 0:53)
workshopped it it wouldn't be that bad (0:51 - 0:55)
all right let's work shopping right now (0:53 - 0:57)
once you guys why (0:55 - 1:01)
super picnic Club yeah (0:57 - 1:01)
Greg's here (1:01 - 1:07)
excuse me professor (1:04 - 1:10)
Professor Greg is here thank you very (1:07 - 1:12)
much dress for the job you want not the (1:10 - 1:15)
job you have people (1:12 - 1:15)
foreign (1:16 - 1:21)
because none of this makes sense we (1:18 - 1:23)
could have had Al on the Galler episodes (1:21 - 1:25)
but you know we have Al on the Spain (1:23 - 1:27)
episode so you know Alice secretly (1:25 - 1:29)
Spanish (1:27 - 1:31)
oh you have (1:29 - 1:34)
is it exactly wow there's a giant hole (1:31 - 1:36)
in the middle of it and there is now to (1:34 - 1:38)
be honest to be honest I slept over most (1:36 - 1:41)
of the trip over and then when I was (1:38 - 1:43)
there I was basically in a hotel for (1:41 - 1:45)
three days with work stuff so okay I (1:43 - 1:48)
didn't really visit it (1:45 - 1:48)
um uh okay so this is our mini series (1:48 - 1:54)
I'm planning on five to six episodes (1:51 - 1:55)
gonna lay out the structure here so when (1:54 - 1:56)
you listen to future episodes you know (1:55 - 1:58)
what's happening (1:56 - 1:59)
um so each episode is going to be (1:58 - 2:00)
structured we're going to tell you up (1:59 - 2:02)
front exactly what we're talking about (2:00 - 2:03)
we're going to tell you what we're not (2:02 - 2:04)
talking about so for example this (2:03 - 2:06)
episode we're going to talk about the (2:04 - 2:09)
Pokedex for scarlet and violet so you (2:06 - 2:10)
don't have to worry about any story (2:09 - 2:12)
spoilers now you might be like well I'm (2:10 - 2:14)
not done with the game I don't want to (2:12 - 2:15)
listen to this we're not going to talk (2:14 - 2:18)
about any Pokemon that are in area zero (2:15 - 2:20)
which is the center of that map yeah (2:18 - 2:22)
that would be a lot of those uh maybe (2:20 - 2:24)
special Pokemon out there uh we're not (2:22 - 2:25)
going to talk about any of those like (2:24 - 2:26)
new legendaries we know there are two (2:25 - 2:28)
Corydon and me ride on we're not going (2:26 - 2:29)
to talk about anymore there's a couple (2:28 - 2:31)
legendaries and then there's all the (2:29 - 2:33)
Pokemon in area zero but otherwise (2:31 - 2:36)
returning Pokemon fair game the Pokemon (2:33 - 2:39)
that you've seen the Overworld all fair (2:36 - 2:41)
game that's a lot of Pokemon there's a (2:39 - 2:43)
uh you know there's a hundred plus new (2:41 - 2:47)
Pokemon in this generation uh I for for (2:43 - 2:49)
oh over a year didn't think they would (2:47 - 2:52)
go past the a thousand in the Pokedex (2:49 - 2:55)
because I thought they would save that (2:52 - 2:57)
for Gen 10 a thousand Pokemon 10 (2:55 - 3:00)
Generations plus you would think that (2:57 - 3:01)
they would want the 1000 Pokemon to be (3:00 - 3:02)
special (3:01 - 3:04)
I think we can maybe talk about that (3:02 - 3:05)
Pokemon because I even though there is (3:04 - 3:07)
not final Pokedex numbers I think (3:05 - 3:09)
everyone kind of suspects what the 1000 (3:07 - 3:12)
Pokemon is so I guess yeah based on (3:09 - 3:14)
assumptions assumptions that I haven't (3:12 - 3:17)
been through in previous games (3:14 - 3:19)
so (3:17 - 3:20)
um so yeah we're gonna be talking about (3:19 - 3:22)
Pokemon the second episode we'll be (3:20 - 3:25)
talking about the Titan third episode it (3:22 - 3:27)
will probably be team (3:25 - 3:30)
star almost said team flare fourth (3:27 - 3:32)
episode will be (3:30 - 3:36)
um the the gym leader stuff and then uh (3:32 - 3:38)
a fifth episode would probably be like (3:36 - 3:40)
kind of everything put together we might (3:38 - 3:41)
need two episodes for that that's why I (3:40 - 3:43)
say like five to six because we're still (3:41 - 3:46)
trying to keep these episodes 45 minutes (3:43 - 3:47)
um and this is the first time they're (3:46 - 3:48)
growing up on YouTube so if you're (3:47 - 3:50)

uh at the gym so you know there we got (4:17 - 4:23)
our audio people worked out here (4:20 - 4:24)
um (4:23 - 4:27)
let's start with the the basics here uh (4:24 - 4:29)
starter Pokemon I I want to talk about (4:27 - 4:35)
sprigatito uh Flora gato uh miascarata (4:29 - 4:37)
Fuego this is going to be the worst the (4:35 - 4:39)
worst episode isn't it (4:37 - 4:42)
way Coco (4:39 - 4:44)
I'm saying a lot of these out loud for (4:42 - 4:46)
the first time crackalore crocolor (4:44 - 4:49)
Skelly skeletons (4:46 - 4:51)
Skelly durge (4:49 - 4:54)
skeletorgeous (4:51 - 4:54)
uh quaxley quacks well and then (4:54 - 5:00)
quackaval (4:58 - 5:03)
how you say that (5:00 - 5:05)
um so for the longest time I I wanted to (5:03 - 5:07)
be like you know two legs four legs gay (5:05 - 5:12)
duck uh uh and that is what it is two (5:07 - 5:14)
legs four legs and a gay duck (5:12 - 5:17)
the gayest duck they've created and we (5:14 - 5:21)
all love we love our little our little (5:17 - 5:25)
timid gay boy growing into the fine (5:21 - 5:26)
Pride dancer (5:25 - 5:30)
that he has become uh I'll I'll start (5:26 - 5:32)
with you what do we you know a lot of (5:30 - 5:34)
starters over the years how do we feel (5:32 - 5:37)
about these final evolutions (5:34 - 5:39)
uh okay right well I think we can all (5:37 - 5:41)
agree that Coco will or however it said (5:39 - 5:42)
is uh (5:41 - 5:46)
fabulous fantastic great quaxley was (5:42 - 5:48)
mayor but evolved into fantastic final (5:46 - 5:52)
evolution uh skelodurge um fine I I (5:48 - 5:53)
don't think you could have done any (5:52 - 5:55)
better than that unless you just did (5:53 - 5:58)
free Coco but bigger like I think the (5:55 - 6:00)
problem is if we Coco was too good that (5:58 - 6:01)
I don't think they could have done (6:00 - 6:03)
something better later on unless it was (6:01 - 6:06)
just massive way Coco (6:03 - 6:07)
um which which I mean in my opinion (6:06 - 6:08)
would have been better (6:07 - 6:12)
well yes yeah it's fair but she was gone (6:08 - 6:14)
back which is bigger (6:12 - 6:17)
I like it being ghost though but anyway (6:14 - 6:18)
um I um (6:17 - 6:21)
I don't really have any feelings for (6:18 - 6:24)
sprigatito was pretty boring in the (6:21 - 6:25)
first place the only thing going for it (6:24 - 6:28)
was it was cute and it loses that so I'm (6:25 - 6:30)
not massively bothered about it (6:28 - 6:34)
Greg what are your thoughts here bad and (6:30 - 6:38)
bad what these three three starters have (6:34 - 6:41)
just do not do it for me uh of them the (6:38 - 6:46)
quaxi line is consistently the best (6:41 - 6:49)
um but like way Coco starts kind of cute (6:46 - 6:51)
and then just (6:49 - 6:53)
gets worse (6:51 - 6:54)
and (6:53 - 6:57)
uh Flora gato is the best of the three (6:54 - 7:00)
it is the cutest and one that makes the (6:57 - 7:01)
most sense (7:00 - 7:06)
the other two are just okay like I think (7:01 - 7:09)
this ranks in the bottom of my starters (7:06 - 7:12)
list wow like I will put I wouldn't put (7:09 - 7:15)
any of the three in my top ten you you (7:12 - 7:16)
put you put Gallop pretty high if I (7:15 - 7:18)
remember right I love the what Geller (7:16 - 7:22)
ones yeah okay except for supper (7:18 - 7:22)
off to the side (7:24 - 7:28)
which is good we're gonna ignore (7:26 - 7:32)
I think for for Middle Evolutions I (7:28 - 7:35)
think Florida gato is really great (7:32 - 7:37)
um and honestly when I looked at leaks I (7:35 - 7:38)
I thought it was the final (7:37 - 7:41)
uh for a hot second (7:38 - 7:44)
um I think crackalore is is actually a (7:41 - 7:46)
real good upgrade from Fue Coco it looks (7:44 - 7:48)
like a little Sombrero but it's actually (7:46 - 7:50)
uh it's actually like a little Nest yeah (7:48 - 7:53)
uh yeah and I think there is a lot of (7:50 - 7:55)
creativity in in scella Ridge of like (7:53 - 7:57)
that Nest finally hatching and then the (7:55 - 8:00)
little Firebird runs yeah (7:57 - 8:03)
thematically of having the crocodiles (8:00 - 8:05)
that have their little bird that goes (8:03 - 8:06)
into their mouth and cleans up like real (8:05 - 8:09)
life like converting that into a real (8:06 - 8:12)
thing it's cute also to make them each (8:09 - 8:15)
some sort of Entertainer it's really (8:12 - 8:17)
interesting because we have the magician (8:15 - 8:20)
we have the singer and we have the (8:17 - 8:22)
dancer the magician is like a weird (8:20 - 8:24)
addition because you generally (8:22 - 8:27)
don't go to work (8:24 - 8:27)
dancer and (8:28 - 8:31)
could have had a top hat could have been (8:34 - 8:38)
a ring Master because they all kind of (8:37 - 8:41)
look like they belong in a circus (8:38 - 8:42)
um (8:41 - 8:45)
magician is just a weird (8:42 - 8:47)
ad to that (8:45 - 8:51)
line up because that's just not (8:47 - 8:54)
have you have you read Skeletor just uh (8:51 - 8:57)
pokedex entry because it turns out the (8:54 - 9:01)
birds the firebird has its own soul (8:57 - 9:03)
yeah it's not technically part of (9:01 - 9:04)
skeleton (9:03 - 9:07)
it's like Kamala and the log but the log (9:04 - 9:09)
turns shiny no but this is confirmed by (9:07 - 9:12)
the Pokedex right this isn't some weird (9:09 - 9:15)
fan theory yes much as the Pokedex (9:12 - 9:16)
confirms things because that thing's (9:15 - 9:20)
full of lies but yes uh because the bird (9:16 - 9:22)
tages shape it becomes an attack with (9:20 - 9:25)
torch lock which which I will say the (9:22 - 9:30)
move torch song is a brilliant (9:25 - 9:30)
brilliant name for uh for uh (9:30 - 9:36)
for a move it hits on many many levels I (9:33 - 9:39)
like that move a lot I love torch song I (9:36 - 9:43)
just am not agreed I'm not a fan of the (9:39 - 9:46)
final the final kind of weird Clowney it (9:43 - 9:50)
kind of here's my problem (9:46 - 9:50)
what's the deal with Evolution yeah it (9:50 - 9:56)
makes me think it makes me look like (9:53 - 9:59)
he's a juggalo and that bothers me ah so (9:56 - 10:02)
he's from Michigan yes got it Michigan (9:59 - 10:05)
Pokemon who's a juggalo (10:02 - 10:07)
um I think I think uh I think quacks (10:05 - 10:09)
well is like the the weakest of the (10:07 - 10:11)
middle the Maxwell is not (10:09 - 10:15)
not great it's fine it's fine it's like (10:11 - 10:18)
the standard middle Evo of like being (10:15 - 10:21)
forgettable and I think Galler and maybe (10:18 - 10:23)
another gen really had good middle evos (10:21 - 10:25)
I think that was kind of a shining thing (10:23 - 10:28)
of Galler is like reboot probably still (10:25 - 10:30)
one of the top two all-time middle (10:28 - 10:33)
Evolutions he's a hooligan no (10:30 - 10:36)
um uh we we get the whole duck actually (10:33 - 10:37)
turning into peacock I don't think (10:36 - 10:39)
anyone is is (10:37 - 10:43)
going to try to debate that quack quack (10:39 - 10:47)
of all quack quack quaval is is a quack (10:43 - 10:50)
peacock based on its its beak and uh (10:47 - 10:52)
it's obvious peacock tail in motion (10:50 - 10:54)
which you can't see in the screenshots (10:52 - 10:56)
like that yeah this is this is one where (10:54 - 10:58)
the leaks I was really not impressed by (10:56 - 10:59)
but when you see it in game you're just (10:58 - 11:01)
like oh okay no I've completely changed (10:59 - 11:05)
my opinion yes it's just fantastic (11:01 - 11:08)
um especially like um uh who um quite (11:05 - 11:09)
often will will like hype you up if (11:08 - 11:11)
you're running around and and spinning (11:09 - 11:14)
uh like in the over world if you've got (11:11 - 11:17)
them out it's it just the interaction is (11:14 - 11:20)
so good yeah and they all have uh really (11:17 - 11:23)
great moves um miascarata's signature (11:20 - 11:25)
move always crits uh someone's gonna (11:23 - 11:26)
have to fill me in on those crocodiles (11:25 - 11:29)
uh krakival's move is pretty much uh (11:26 - 11:32)
flame wheel uh you hit really hard with (11:29 - 11:34)
water type move and your speed gets (11:32 - 11:35)
boosted which is actually really good (11:34 - 11:36)
for him (11:35 - 11:39)
yeah flip charge sorry because their (11:36 - 11:41)
base speed is like I believe 85. male (11:39 - 11:43)
escarade's base speed is like 123. it's (11:41 - 11:43)
it's (11:43 - 11:46)
very high I don't know what scalarages (11:43 - 11:49)
scalarages (11:46 - 11:52)
it boosts special attack but yeah it was (11:49 - 11:54)
their special attack (11:52 - 11:56)
um (11:54 - 11:56)
um (11:56 - 12:02)
so yeah I I like them I like them (11:57 - 12:05)
I just don't love them (12:02 - 12:08)
uh I think at this point (12:05 - 12:08)
um (12:08 - 12:11)
we we might have to be checking on all (12:08 - 12:12)
of our uh (12:11 - 12:14)
you know all of our our community (12:12 - 12:17)
members that really wanted this cat to (12:14 - 12:19)
stay on four legs they are not they are (12:17 - 12:21)
not well believed I think I've heard (12:19 - 12:23)
from them and they are not doing okay (12:21 - 12:26)
and that is valid they should not be (12:23 - 12:28)
doing okay I mean you look you got (12:26 - 12:30)
pyroar he's on four legs uh you got a (12:28 - 12:32)
Persian they're on four legs I mean you (12:30 - 12:34)
got cat you got options out there (12:32 - 12:34)
um (12:34 - 12:38)
I don't mind saying to have M M's at (12:34 - 12:39)
home (12:38 - 12:41)
and their knockout or say they have (12:39 - 12:43)
Oreos at home and they're Hydrox (12:41 - 12:47)
it's like no I do not know no they're (12:43 - 12:48)
not as good ma (12:47 - 12:50)
we also need to check on the Chinese (12:48 - 12:53)
zodiac people they've been they've been (12:50 - 12:56)
stretching for for years honestly uh and (12:53 - 12:58)
I don't know how to see someone try and (12:56 - 12:59)
justify this one I can't even remember (12:58 - 13:00)
what they said because it was so crazy (12:59 - 13:03)
it just something like crocodiles are (13:00 - 13:05)
related to snakes or something I think (13:03 - 13:07)
it was something weird like a reputation (13:05 - 13:09)
you are you are absolutely stretching (13:07 - 13:12)
like that makes no sense you can stretch (13:09 - 13:14)
anything into whatever you want this way (13:12 - 13:17)
if it's stretching for 20 some years (13:14 - 13:19)
it's like why don't we just say a (13:17 - 13:21)
crocodile's a dog then right like what (13:19 - 13:26)
even is the point yeah well you know I (13:21 - 13:27)
mean there are a bunch of good dogs in (13:26 - 13:29)
here so you might as well just slide it (13:27 - 13:30)
in that's true that's true a lot of (13:29 - 13:33)
dollars Birds this generation a lot of (13:30 - 13:36)
dogs a lot of birds and a lot of one Evo (13:33 - 13:37)
fish (13:36 - 13:40)
oh yeah okay yeah uh so here's the thing (13:37 - 13:43)
I I foreign (13:40 - 13:43)
because soon as double showed up people (13:46 - 13:50)
boxed that Pokemon moved on to a (13:48 - 13:52)
different thing (13:50 - 13:55)
um uh oink oinklage oink all alone owing (13:52 - 13:58)
clone okay it's like cologne right it's (13:55 - 14:00)
oink and cologne yeah yeah quick alone (13:58 - 14:02)
is what I've been saying we have uh just (14:00 - 14:05)
like pyroar pyro is getting the most (14:02 - 14:06)
attention they've ever received in the (14:05 - 14:09)
history like like pyroar there's a male (14:06 - 14:11)
and there's a female version (14:09 - 14:14)
um just quick thoughts on this (14:11 - 14:17)
I I really like it it's it's still in my (14:14 - 14:18)
team (14:17 - 14:19)
um when I'm coming up to the end of the (14:18 - 14:22)
game uh and I think it has a good kind (14:19 - 14:24)
of I think I think some people were (14:22 - 14:26)
disappointed I've seen a lot of classic (14:24 - 14:28)
tick tocks of people like evolving (14:26 - 14:30)
something and going oh this is going to (14:28 - 14:31)
be great and then they're disappointed (14:30 - 14:32)
with it oh and I don't know what people (14:31 - 14:35)
were wanting out of this like it's it's (14:32 - 14:37)
like the chunk but sassy and bigger like (14:35 - 14:39)
I don't I I don't see what you what you (14:37 - 14:42)
what do you what do you expect like just (14:39 - 14:46)
everything bigger hey what if they made (14:42 - 14:49)
a game where your Pokemon I got bigger (14:46 - 14:50)
bigger it's like if you want to play (14:49 - 14:53)
with the chunk play with Le chunk you (14:50 - 14:54)
don't have to evolve it you can keep it (14:53 - 14:57)
the way it is and it's that's perfectly (14:54 - 14:59)
valid (14:57 - 15:02)
uh I mean I think it's cute but I I did (14:59 - 15:03)
box at the minute I saw one particular (15:02 - 15:06)
Pokemon and I'm like well you're out (15:03 - 15:08)
I like how I think it's the male one has (15:06 - 15:10)
like a little fort like his curly tail (15:08 - 15:12)
turns like a fork I think that's pretty (15:10 - 15:14)
cute no that's a female the female oh (15:12 - 15:17)
the female the female's fork okay (15:14 - 15:19)
um (15:17 - 15:21)
they they they you know Gen 2 got a lot (15:19 - 15:25)
of love uh a lot of uh evos from Gen 2 (15:21 - 15:27)
we got for rigoraf which we probably (15:25 - 15:29)
actually don't have to talk about uh but (15:27 - 15:33)
what about dun dun sparse Greg can I (15:29 - 15:36)
just can I just can I just point out (15:33 - 15:38)
Greg people need to pronounce this (15:36 - 15:40)
correctly everybody's been saying dun (15:38 - 15:42)
Dunsparce there's no first end there's (15:40 - 15:44)
no first (15:42 - 15:44)
right I absolutely love this it is the (15:45 - 15:52)
most trolley Evolution ever I I find (15:48 - 15:53)
that a bit weird that they have two (15:52 - 15:55)
versions of the Dunsparce the like (15:53 - 15:57)
that's it's I don't know why they didn't (15:55 - 16:00)
just do another done sparse like that (15:57 - 16:02)
would have been even funnier but I like (16:00 - 16:04)
it it's funny (16:02 - 16:07)
Greg you've been waiting 20 some years (16:04 - 16:10)
for your boy to evolve yep are you are (16:07 - 16:11)
you satisfied (16:10 - 16:13)
all right so we're gonna go through this (16:11 - 16:15)
journey (16:13 - 16:15)
I love it because it's so dumb and it's (16:16 - 16:23)
so fitting for duns bars because if it (16:20 - 16:26)
had turned into something cool it (16:23 - 16:29)
wouldn't be done sparse anymore so the (16:26 - 16:31)
fact that it just turns into Dunsparce (16:29 - 16:35)
but with extra sets of wings I was like (16:31 - 16:38)
I hate it I love it I will have to get a (16:35 - 16:41)
shiny of it because it's so bad (16:38 - 16:45)
it's good I think the pun is redundant (16:41 - 16:48)
is that yes yeah (16:45 - 16:50)
I think that's supposed to be the (16:48 - 16:53)
um redundant redundant I actually didn't (16:50 - 16:55)
notice I I when you battle (16:53 - 16:56)
um when you battle somebody in the game (16:55 - 16:59)
they have one I think most people have (16:56 - 17:01)
most of the new Pokemon that's how you (16:59 - 17:03)
see a lot of them is there an actual (17:01 - 17:04)
difference between the two and the three (17:03 - 17:08)
is it an EVO thing it's a random Evo (17:04 - 17:09)
thing (17:08 - 17:12)
like is the same with the mouse it's it (17:09 - 17:16)
you'll randomly get the other version (17:12 - 17:18)
there may be something more behind it (17:16 - 17:20)
that they haven't discovered yet right (17:18 - 17:22)
like the data miners are like yeah you (17:20 - 17:24)
do it from six to seven that's what (17:22 - 17:27)
Generations I believe if we're able to (17:24 - 17:29)
talk about this I believe then they know (17:27 - 17:32)
it's completely random but it's a one in (17:29 - 17:35)
25 chance of getting the three segment (17:32 - 17:36)
form we've believed a lot that's pretty (17:35 - 17:39)
cool we're random but they turned out (17:36 - 17:41)
now you have to be so but right now it (17:39 - 17:43)
is sure there's always random right (17:41 - 17:45)
right there's always a chance the seed (17:43 - 17:48)
of how the rain starts of course of (17:45 - 17:49)
course but it's random in so much as (17:48 - 17:52)
like wormple is random as far as as far (17:49 - 17:54)
as can be seen oh right right right (17:52 - 17:56)
that's a good example Wormhole random (17:54 - 17:58)
this okay cool I think that's the only (17:56 - 18:00)
other one that actually is random (17:58 - 18:03)
um yeah uh well Pokemon go if you want (18:00 - 18:07)
to evolve clamper I guess yeah no no (18:03 - 18:11)
we're not talking about that Insanity uh (18:07 - 18:13)
so I okay I don't know how to say this (18:11 - 18:16)
one to Rand tarantula (18:13 - 18:19)
the the spider yeah I mean I mean it's (18:16 - 18:22)
just like Tehran Tyrone tarantula I (18:19 - 18:25)
think yeah (18:22 - 18:25)
and then it evolves into uh spydops (18:26 - 18:32)
which I which is I I guess spider and (18:29 - 18:33)
like (18:32 - 18:37)
Call of Duty Ops right like no it's the (18:33 - 18:40)
top it's a top the bottom is the spring (18:37 - 18:44)
oh I can't see his arm is blocking it (18:40 - 18:44)
um (18:44 - 18:46)
I think the spider is super cute I think (18:44 - 18:49)
the evolution I I don't totally dig I'm (18:46 - 18:53)
sure somebody digs it uh my face reminds (18:49 - 18:55)
me of the series of stickers that (18:53 - 18:57)
existed like I think back in the 80s and (18:55 - 18:59)
I can't remember exactly what it was but (18:57 - 19:01)
it had those eyes and the minute I saw (18:59 - 19:05)
it I went I well the first one I saw (19:01 - 19:07)
the spool of string with legs and I said (19:05 - 19:11)
we're done no we're out I hate this (19:07 - 19:13)
thing this is the worst thing I have (19:11 - 19:15)
ever seen and then I saw its revolve (19:13 - 19:16)
sword said oh and then they made it (19:15 - 19:18)
worse (19:16 - 19:20)
they made it worse they made it into (19:18 - 19:23)
it's the thing is it's like people are (19:20 - 19:25)
like oh it's an ogre like a cyclops that (19:23 - 19:27)
I'm like well then it should only have (19:25 - 19:30)
one eye which it does is also based off (19:27 - 19:32)
of a top (19:30 - 19:34)
because the bottom is is this it pulls (19:32 - 19:36)
the string to wrap around yeah I see (19:34 - 19:38)
that now I didn't notice that the first (19:36 - 19:40)
time I thought they should have got with (19:38 - 19:42)
maybe a spool because it's like a ball (19:40 - 19:44)
of yarn and then a spool of thread but (19:42 - 19:46)
they didn't name it that's what I (19:44 - 19:48)
thought it was (19:46 - 19:49)
because it is a spool of thread because (19:48 - 19:51)
if you've seen it out it's threatening (19:49 - 19:53)
to kill people (19:51 - 19:56)
like he like gets real low and crawls (19:53 - 19:58)
yeah because it's a trap spider is (19:56 - 20:01)
supposed to come up behind you and then (19:58 - 20:03)
garage you with its weird thread because (20:01 - 20:05)
if you see it in the wild it's like (20:03 - 20:06)
pulling the thread menacing at you and (20:05 - 20:09)
I'm like I hate this thing with a (20:06 - 20:11)
passion I hate it (20:09 - 20:13)
yeah you know you gotta have a couple of (20:11 - 20:15)
Duds the Gin I think this is the first (20:13 - 20:18)
dud up to this point yeah (20:15 - 20:21)
you like having it is it on your team I (20:18 - 20:23)
love it yeah he's on my team okay (20:21 - 20:25)
baseball type in the game (20:23 - 20:28)
uh I will say when I played in New York (20:25 - 20:31)
uh the the spider was not in any of the (20:28 - 20:34)
area what what did you see that you (20:31 - 20:36)
couldn't talk about I couldn't okay so (20:34 - 20:38)
the the big the big Pokemon that knocked (20:36 - 20:41)
me out and I think I said on the podcast (20:38 - 20:43)
I I don't love it but I know other (20:41 - 20:46)
people will absolutely love it was the (20:43 - 20:49)
flamingo Flamingo (20:46 - 20:51)
is the greatest thing that's ever (20:49 - 20:52)
existed we'll get we'll get the we (20:51 - 20:54)
should go in order just so you know we (20:52 - 20:56)
get every Pokemon but uh when I saw a (20:54 - 20:58)
lot of the new Pokemon (20:56 - 21:00)
um like the Minecraft Salt thing I also (20:58 - 21:02)
saw early (21:00 - 21:03)
um they didn't have they had Japanese (21:02 - 21:06)
names so when I like ran into Le chunk (21:03 - 21:07)
it said Le chunk and then when I ran (21:06 - 21:09)
into flamigo it just had a Japanese name (21:07 - 21:12)
so I had no clue what it was called (21:09 - 21:14)
um also I couldn't talk about it but (21:12 - 21:18)
um yeah so the tarantula thingy is all (21:14 - 21:20)
scattered around like I'm doing air (21:18 - 21:22)
quotes route one and Route 2 and Route (21:20 - 21:23)
three (21:22 - 21:26)
um but it was scrubbed from My Places I (21:23 - 21:28)
never saw this one at all (21:26 - 21:29)
um (21:28 - 21:33)
we have Nimble and low kicks low low (21:29 - 21:37)
kicks is that lockix low Kix lock X (21:33 - 21:39)
depends if you're if you consider it (21:37 - 21:41)
low-key or not (21:39 - 21:43)
yeah (21:41 - 21:45)
um nimble (21:43 - 21:48)
I I Adore it I think it's so cute and so (21:45 - 21:49)
great (21:48 - 21:52)
um I like I like both these Pokemon a (21:49 - 21:54)
whole lot like these will probably be my (21:52 - 21:56)
bugs of the generation of these two I I (21:54 - 21:58)
don't know Nimble to me is just really (21:56 - 22:01)
really cute he's really tiny (21:58 - 22:03)
um I like the way he moves I like his (22:01 - 22:05)
design I like his color scheme I think (22:03 - 22:08)
the Evo is great too uh I don't I dig (22:05 - 22:11)
them I didn't put them on my team uh but (22:08 - 22:13)
I I I I don't know a good name too (22:11 - 22:16)
Nimble I don't know he's he's good (22:13 - 22:18)
Greg's shaking his head you don't like (22:16 - 22:19)
him nope (22:18 - 22:21)
you don't like grasshoppers I'm not a (22:19 - 22:23)
big bug person so all right here's the (22:21 - 22:25)
thing nipple is kind of cute for a (22:23 - 22:29)
grasshopper when it's walk when locix is (22:25 - 22:31)
walking around I'm just like why is (22:29 - 22:33)
there a weird robot the problem is is (22:31 - 22:36)
that it looks like the machine it should (22:33 - 22:37)
be steel but yeah it looks like it (22:36 - 22:38)
should be but it looks like The (22:37 - 22:39)
Machinist (22:38 - 22:42)
The Machinist robot in Final Fantasy 14. (22:39 - 22:45)
so when I see it I'm like you haven't (22:42 - 22:47)
played machinists now get a robot that (22:45 - 22:49)
deploys I only got it when they had a (22:47 - 22:51)
turret right no they have a full-on (22:49 - 22:53)
robot and it looks like that and it (22:51 - 22:57)
bothers me every time I hate it (22:53 - 22:59)
I don't I don't hate them I don't really (22:57 - 23:02)
have that any feelings towards them the (22:59 - 23:04)
only thing I find interesting was locix (23:02 - 23:06)
is quite terrifying in the Overworld uh (23:04 - 23:10)
yeah chase after you very fast (23:06 - 23:10)
excuse me big uh Ben 10 energy like it (23:12 - 23:18)
applies yeah like I'm not a fan (23:15 - 23:21)
uh we have uh (23:18 - 23:22)
[Music] (23:21 - 23:24)
re-lower (23:22 - 23:26)
roller I don't know how to say his name (23:24 - 23:31)
it's relor I think relor and then (23:26 - 23:35)
rabska rebska (23:31 - 23:35)
um finally we have (23:37 - 23:45)
confirmed dung beetle in the game (23:40 - 23:45)
rolling dust (23:45 - 23:51)
yeah I mean it has a it has a really (23:49 - 23:54)
good shiny Yeah well yeah but it's also (23:51 - 23:56)
confusing right why is the dung changing (23:54 - 23:57)
color (23:56 - 24:01)
Kabbalah 2.0 (23:57 - 24:01)
that doesn't make any sense because you (24:02 - 24:05)
see them out in the whale they're (24:04 - 24:07)
rolling up the dust on the ground why is (24:05 - 24:09)
this very shady ones (24:07 - 24:11)
it doesn't make any sense because it (24:09 - 24:13)
found a nugget on the ground like you do (24:11 - 24:17)
so instead of fighting that one it dust (24:13 - 24:19)
it found a nugget in the desert and then (24:17 - 24:22)
it becomes the golden Scarab when it (24:19 - 24:25)
finds the eye of Sauron I I I get the (24:22 - 24:26)
golden Scarab kind of thing that they (24:25 - 24:28)
were going with the the shiny (24:26 - 24:31)
um they're they're they're fine uh I I (24:28 - 24:33)
don't know they look they added a bunch (24:31 - 24:36)
of bugs this Jen and I'm sure this I'm (24:33 - 24:38)
sure the bug fans are I'm sure some bug (24:36 - 24:40)
catcher out there is over the moon (24:38 - 24:41)
they're very happy that they got a bunch (24:40 - 24:44)
of bugs uh I mean I like the fact that (24:41 - 24:46)
it finds an evil eyeball that stares at (24:44 - 24:50)
you like inside the ball of (24:46 - 24:53)
dust was it was somebody's I was an evil (24:50 - 24:55)
sorcerer's eyeball and it is now staring (24:53 - 24:57)
at you (24:55 - 25:00)
um we have green griever gree grievard (24:57 - 25:03)
grievard uh which you know the the (25:00 - 25:05)
biggest complaint here is they just put (25:03 - 25:07)
a lit wick on it said I think it pays (25:05 - 25:09)
off when it I didn't have a problem with (25:07 - 25:11)
it I think it pays off when it revolves (25:09 - 25:13)
into houndstone uh houndstone to me (25:11 - 25:16)
looks fantastic I absolutely love it so (25:13 - 25:18)
bad (25:16 - 25:21)
I kind of like it but I I don't I'm a (25:18 - 25:24)
bit confused as to why the the light (25:21 - 25:27)
turns the fire turns into a tombstone we (25:24 - 25:29)
got a little duck evolving into a gay (25:27 - 25:31)
peacock we can't no no I know I don't (25:29 - 25:33)
know I know I get that right but like (25:31 - 25:34)
what's the what's the story you're (25:33 - 25:37)
telling us here right like and I I get I (25:34 - 25:39)
quite like the rest of the design I (25:37 - 25:40)
don't like the tombstone on the head I (25:39 - 25:42)
would have said it to be like they are (25:40 - 25:45)
bigger candle or something the idea that (25:42 - 25:47)
I think is kind of going off of the (25:45 - 25:49)
freshly dead you're honoring because (25:47 - 25:52)
it's a fresh it's a fresh corpse so to (25:49 - 25:54)
speak and so you're honoring them with a (25:52 - 25:57)
candle and then when it evolves it has (25:54 - 25:59)
been in the ground for a very long time (25:57 - 26:02)
you have created the tombstone you (25:59 - 26:04)
buried it because it's just a skeleton (26:02 - 26:06)
at this point so I think it's meant to (26:04 - 26:10)
show the progression of grieving freshly (26:06 - 26:13)
honored to you have a place to go (26:10 - 26:17)
memorial a place to visit a tombstone I (26:13 - 26:20)
don't like it okay so my love for (26:17 - 26:24)
grievard died so we're excited with the (26:20 - 26:26)
dog I mean thematically I think they hit (26:24 - 26:27)
the mark then so we're zero out of one (26:26 - 26:29)
for Greg and dogs (26:27 - 26:30)
yep (26:29 - 26:33)
um real quick not to Sidetrack did these (26:30 - 26:34)
games not come out in China I know (26:33 - 26:38)
they're very strict about skeletons (26:34 - 26:38)
and so like (26:39 - 26:43)
they are no they are very strict about (26:41 - 26:46)
human (26:43 - 26:46)
um I I know that most most of the things (26:49 - 26:55)
revolve around human remains not (26:52 - 26:58)
necessarily animal remains (26:55 - 27:01)
um so it is possible lots of games that (26:58 - 27:03)
have had to change specifically a (27:01 - 27:05)
character or two in China because of (27:03 - 27:08)
skeletons yes (27:05 - 27:08)
I don't think this falls into that (27:09 - 27:15)
because it is a it is an animal skeleton (27:11 - 27:17)
and not a human skeleton which is why we (27:15 - 27:19)
did apparently (27:17 - 27:21)
sorry go ahead (27:19 - 27:23)
I was just saying they did a pattern (27:21 - 27:24)
only change the story for the Chinese (27:23 - 27:26)
version though oh (27:24 - 27:28)
all right yeah it doesn't surprise me (27:26 - 27:29)
actually I can't talk about that yet (27:28 - 27:33)
though uh we have flittle and S (27:29 - 27:36)
pothra (27:33 - 27:36)
look they finally have the lgbtq (27:50 - 27:58)
community weighing in because we got (27:53 - 27:59)
the diva (27:58 - 28:04)
the moment the icon is bartha (27:59 - 28:06)
who everybody's like oh it's Lady Gaga (28:04 - 28:08)
which I kind of see but the first time I (28:06 - 28:10)
saw it went oh it's got Sia's haircut (28:08 - 28:13)
we all have a diva singer that we all (28:10 - 28:16)
associated with this bird and it like (28:13 - 28:18)
you look at little flittle and you think (28:16 - 28:20)
you're hot garbage (28:18 - 28:23)
you are bad and everything about you is (28:20 - 28:25)
atrocious (28:23 - 28:27)
and then you're like but I will I will (28:25 - 28:28)
stick it out for you to evolve into our (28:27 - 28:32)
super Diva and it does (28:28 - 28:35)
yeah it's fine yeah I mean they they did (28:32 - 28:38)
the ostrich if there's if there's a line (28:35 - 28:40)
if there's anything that this generation (28:38 - 28:42)
has done it goes what Pokemon have we (28:40 - 28:47)
done check moving on oh yeah and we're (28:42 - 28:48)
here for it (28:47 - 28:51)
um we can kind of skip for for a graph I (28:48 - 28:53)
mean it is what it is we talked about it (28:51 - 28:56)
before uh Wiglet and they did it (28:53 - 28:58)
they they just they just they just did (28:56 - 29:02)
it rug Trio no no it's (28:58 - 29:05)
they they did it uh as somebody who used (29:02 - 29:08)
the lug Trio for 20 hours (29:05 - 29:12)
it's not good hey I tried so hard it (29:08 - 29:14)
just it I think it has an HP stat of 35 (29:12 - 29:16)
or something it doesn't matter what (29:14 - 29:19)
attacks it it just faints (29:16 - 29:21)
um good shiny though (29:19 - 29:24)
yeah so uh look man I don't know what (29:21 - 29:26)
else to say either you either like the (29:24 - 29:28)
joke or you don't it really comes down I (29:26 - 29:30)
didn't like the joke the first time and (29:28 - 29:33)
I hated it the second time (29:30 - 29:37)
okay now it starts our journey of 800 (29:33 - 29:40)
fish 800 single Evolution fish for no (29:37 - 29:43)
good reason well we'll skip we'll skip (29:40 - 29:45)
this one for now we'll we'll we'll go to (29:43 - 29:48)
uh velusa (29:45 - 29:48)
again for those maybe not paying (29:48 - 29:52)
attention to my twitch streams I decided (29:51 - 29:54)
to do a whole water mono type (29:52 - 29:56)
playthrough (29:54 - 30:01)
um kind of hard uh when uh you just only (29:56 - 30:02)
have (30:01 - 30:05)
Surf and waterfall and AquaJet like you (30:02 - 30:07)
don't have a lot of options but there's (30:05 - 30:08)
a lot of water pokemon so made possible (30:07 - 30:11)
I put this on my team (30:08 - 30:13)
um it you know you would think that this (30:11 - 30:14)
would be fast because when you're in the (30:13 - 30:17)
water it zooms to you sharp faster than (30:14 - 30:20)
sharp Sharpedo does in the Isle of armor (30:17 - 30:22)
there's only base speed 70. it's not (30:20 - 30:24)
particularly fast it's water psychic (30:22 - 30:26)
again without looking at it you would (30:24 - 30:28)
think like oh it's like a Steel type (30:26 - 30:30)
Pokemon it looks like a metal fish it's (30:28 - 30:31)
not (30:30 - 30:32)
um (30:31 - 30:35)
I like it I I think it's grown on me (30:32 - 30:36)
because I was forced to I'm not forced (30:35 - 30:39)
but you know I was like I want to use (30:36 - 30:40)
the new sharp water shark but like it's (30:39 - 30:43)
really cute in the picnics and um it's (30:41 - 30:45)
like fainting animation is is very cute (30:43 - 30:47)
uh (30:45 - 30:49)
uh it's (30:47 - 30:51)
I could see maybe in 15 years it gets (30:49 - 30:53)
like some weird Evolution like basklin (30:51 - 30:55)
right yeah it's it's fine I was like oh (30:53 - 30:57)
it's a fish (30:55 - 30:58)
okay yeah (30:57 - 31:00)
it's quite angular I think it looks (30:58 - 31:01)
better from far away than it does up (31:00 - 31:04)
close personally (31:01 - 31:07)
yeah it it kind of just feels like it (31:04 - 31:10)
Should Have a Gimmick or something and (31:07 - 31:11)
it just really does I guess it's gimmick (31:10 - 31:15)
is like it just crits like but (31:11 - 31:17)
um (31:15 - 31:19)
so did Pokemon in the last 20 some years (31:17 - 31:22)
have that also gimmick of just credit uh (31:19 - 31:24)
speaking of gimmicks we have finnison oh (31:22 - 31:28)
boy uh who evolves into palafin yeah (31:24 - 31:31)
yeah love love love and if if they did (31:28 - 31:35)
it 26 years later we have now hit the (31:31 - 31:39)
dolphin check mark yep we had done it (31:35 - 31:41)
with gorbus so let's we (31:39 - 31:46)
add we had the river dolphin in gorbis (31:41 - 31:48)
and now we have the ocean dolphin in (31:46 - 31:50)
finison (31:48 - 31:53)
um fitizen is a play on citizen which (31:50 - 31:55)
doesn't make a whole bunch of sense (31:53 - 31:58)
until it evolves into palafin which (31:55 - 32:00)
looks exactly like finnison they just (31:58 - 32:02)
put a Care Bear heart on it yeah it's (32:00 - 32:04)
got a Care Bear stare I love this thing (32:02 - 32:06)
if you have not played with the finison (32:04 - 32:08)
it is like dragging around a Magikarp in (32:06 - 32:12)
a fee bass it is it does not hit hard it (32:08 - 32:13)
does not do anything it has a terrible (32:12 - 32:16)
move pool (32:13 - 32:19)
um the the gimmick here is okay so a lot (32:16 - 32:22)
I I want to clear this up because I have (32:19 - 32:25)
seen about 500 tick tocks that do not (32:22 - 32:26)
understand how to evolve this Pokemon (32:25 - 32:28)
they're all like you need to be in Co-op (32:26 - 32:30)
you need to be this level you need to (32:28 - 32:32)
have somebody else with another dolphin (32:30 - 32:33)
you don't I will explain it to you right (32:32 - 32:35)
now (32:33 - 32:38)
in order to evolve finnison into palafin (32:35 - 32:42)
it evolves at level 38 so you can start (32:38 - 32:46)
this process at 37. you connect to the (32:42 - 32:49)
union Circle (32:46 - 32:52)
with a friend and it doesn't matter what (32:49 - 32:53)
the friend is doing they could be on the (32:52 - 32:55)
other side of the map they do not need a (32:53 - 32:57)
Pokemon out they don't need a fitness in (32:55 - 32:58)
your party they literally just have to (32:57 - 33:02)
show up and you can say go away (32:58 - 33:03)
um but as long as you're in the co-op (33:02 - 33:06)
mode you just give your Fitness in a (33:03 - 33:08)
rare candy from 37 to 38 it will evolve (33:06 - 33:11)
there's no other like no you need 18 (33:08 - 33:14)
Dolphins to be surrounded you you just (33:11 - 33:16)
37 to 38 just use rare candy or battle (33:14 - 33:18)
something just a side note if you're (33:16 - 33:20)
battling with the let's go feature it (33:18 - 33:22)
doesn't evolve that way (33:20 - 33:24)
um so just give it a rare candy if you (33:22 - 33:26)
want it you want to do it you don't want (33:24 - 33:28)
to suffer any more levels from 30s (33:26 - 33:29)
though just give it the rare candy and (33:28 - 33:31)
just get it over with (33:29 - 33:33)
um now in zero form it looks exactly the (33:31 - 33:35)
same if you hadn't looked at leaks or (33:33 - 33:38)
spoilers like me I did look at some I (33:35 - 33:40)
didn't see this you're like why did I (33:38 - 33:43)
drink this around for 20 hours (33:40 - 33:45)
um the ability no one knows how this (33:43 - 33:47)
ability works either I'm gonna explain (33:45 - 33:49)
that to you (33:47 - 33:51)
I think we figured it out I think we (33:49 - 33:53)
figured it out but we're still not 100 (33:51 - 33:55)
certain the code's complicated for this (33:53 - 33:58)
sort of stuff but it looks like if you (33:55 - 34:00)
have it out in battle and then you (33:58 - 34:02)
switch it out and then you switch it (34:00 - 34:04)
back that should do it correct yeah some (34:02 - 34:06)
people some people are saying some weird (34:04 - 34:07)
stuff around it oh it has the Pokemon (34:06 - 34:10)
that you switch out to has to lose a (34:07 - 34:11)
certain amount of HP it doesn't seem to (34:10 - 34:13)
be the case no I I I've used this (34:11 - 34:15)
Pokemon from start to finish now I can I (34:13 - 34:18)
can I can tell you it's life story (34:15 - 34:20)
um when it evolves it learns a move (34:18 - 34:22)
called flip turn which is just a water (34:20 - 34:24)
U-turn flip tuner is not a new move it (34:22 - 34:26)
existed in the the Isle of armor it was (34:24 - 34:28)
one of the the moves that you can get at (34:26 - 34:29)
the dojo (34:28 - 34:32)
just water U-turn you do not need flip (34:29 - 34:33)
turn (34:32 - 34:36)
um what Al said is 100 correct you can (34:33 - 34:38)
just switch it out and switch it back in (34:36 - 34:40)
that's all you need (34:38 - 34:43)
um you can't make that easier yeah (34:40 - 34:44)
there's situations where you wouldn't (34:43 - 34:45)
want to use that especially in like a (34:44 - 34:46)
double battle (34:45 - 34:47)
um (34:46 - 34:50)
you can you can you can uh you can (34:47 - 34:51)
manually flip it out you could Baton (34:50 - 34:53)
Pass it you could get Whirlwind you (34:51 - 34:56)
could get roared you can hard switch it (34:53 - 34:59)
um there's tons of ways that you can (34:56 - 35:01)
activate you could probably put red card (34:59 - 35:03)
on it or whatever reject button or (35:01 - 35:07)
whatever to activate it reasons why you (35:03 - 35:09)
wouldn't want to use flip turn takes up (35:07 - 35:11)
a move slot uh if you're in front of a (35:09 - 35:14)
miascarata and it not only outspeeds you (35:11 - 35:16)
it will guarantee Cricket you and you (35:14 - 35:18)
are also weak to it so you will die (35:16 - 35:20)
um uh you can get fed in a double battle (35:18 - 35:22)
you get easily faked out and then double (35:20 - 35:24)
attacked into it which you want to do so (35:22 - 35:26)
there's tons of water absorbed like Greg (35:24 - 35:29)
said there's tons of reasons why you (35:26 - 35:31)
would want to manually switch I'm not (35:29 - 35:33)
saying so (35:31 - 35:36)
that being said when it switches it goes (35:33 - 35:39)
from zero form to Hero form and it comes (35:36 - 35:41)
out as palafin which I believe is a play (35:39 - 35:45)
on Paladin yeah um and uh then it is the (35:41 - 35:49)
superhero dolphin which then solidifies (35:45 - 35:51)
why finnison is called Finn is in (35:49 - 35:52)
because they're like citizens among (35:51 - 35:55)
people it's a it's a play on Superman (35:52 - 35:58)
um it also evolves at level 38 which I (35:55 - 36:00)
believe the very first Superman comic (35:58 - 36:02)
came out in 1938 (36:00 - 36:06)
oh my word uh that's ridiculous (36:02 - 36:09)
I think this is an interesting idea and (36:06 - 36:11)
I really like it except (36:09 - 36:13)
the whole having (36:11 - 36:15)
the having to switch out and switch back (36:13 - 36:16)
in (36:15 - 36:18)
rather than just like if you could just (36:16 - 36:20)
do it as any switch in right you didn't (36:18 - 36:21)
have to do the switch out in the first (36:20 - 36:24)
place so if it's the first Pokemon that (36:21 - 36:25)
you send out then it's not gonna have it (36:24 - 36:27)
but then if it switches in from another (36:25 - 36:31)
Pokemon then that I think that feels it (36:27 - 36:32)
just it's a whole thing because the base (36:31 - 36:35)
stats are so high it's it's almost as (36:32 - 36:37)
high as slacking's based off base stats (36:35 - 36:39)
it's a tire a lot than a lot of pseudo (36:37 - 36:40)
legendaries I mean it's it's base it's a (36:39 - 36:43)
text that is 160. it gets a signature (36:40 - 36:44)
move which is just literally better (36:43 - 36:45)
AquaJet (36:44 - 36:47)
um jet punch it's the only Pokemon that (36:45 - 36:49)
can learn it so (36:47 - 36:52)
in you know when if if you're in the (36:49 - 36:54)
time of gen 3 like Greg and maybe (36:52 - 36:55)
looking at rumors or early leaks you'd (36:54 - 36:57)
look at slacking and you're like oh my (36:55 - 36:59)
gosh look at how powerful this happened (36:57 - 37:01)
in Pokemon go where Pokemon go players (36:59 - 37:03)
were like looking at slacking and then (37:01 - 37:04)
when it was coming and they were like (37:03 - 37:06)
slacking's kind of completely destroy (37:04 - 37:09)
the meta and like they didn't understand (37:06 - 37:13)
like true yeah through it and like I (37:09 - 37:15)
think like made truant kind of work in (37:13 - 37:17)
Pokemon well slacking is useless in (37:15 - 37:19)
Pokemon go it's so bad because Niantic (37:17 - 37:21)
made truant work (37:19 - 37:25)
um so this the this is this is the uh (37:21 - 37:27)
what's the word for it this is like the (37:25 - 37:31)
the disadvantage they gave (37:27 - 37:33)
palafin is like you have to at least (37:31 - 37:35)
switch it yeah (37:33 - 37:37)
yeah that's fair it just it just feels a (37:35 - 37:39)
little bit meh to me in that aspect of (37:37 - 37:41)
things but in general I think it's fun I (37:39 - 37:42)
it's another one of the fun ones where (37:41 - 37:44)
you get to see tick tocks of people (37:42 - 37:46)
being disappointed when it evolves yeah (37:44 - 37:48)
who did that uh I really like the design (37:46 - 37:50)
and everything I think it's really great (37:48 - 37:54)
I like to play on Superman person (37:50 - 37:54)
Greg this is all you we got small lived (37:54 - 38:01)
Olive and our Bowl our Bulova uh it's an (37:56 - 38:04)
olive (38:01 - 38:04)
our believer our believer so when I saw (38:04 - 38:10)
our believer I was like this matches (38:07 - 38:12)
Arena's energy maybe this will save the (38:10 - 38:14)
small of line for Greg and it did (38:12 - 38:17)
actually doll of saved the line I like (38:14 - 38:19)
doll of a lot more than I like the third (38:17 - 38:21)
evolution but I like the third evolution (38:19 - 38:24)
in game when it's got its arms up and it (38:21 - 38:27)
looks like the victory frond from the (38:24 - 38:29)
Olympics (38:27 - 38:33)
um yeah the fast however fast it has to (38:29 - 38:35)
take me to get rid of smallav I will do (38:33 - 38:36)
it (38:35 - 38:40)
whatever how fast I can get it to 25 so (38:36 - 38:43)
it evolves cannot be fast enough because (38:40 - 38:45)
I hate I do not like small love but (38:43 - 38:48)
dollop is so (38:45 - 38:50)
super cute such a great design (38:48 - 38:54)
absolutely adorable 100 percent (38:50 - 38:58)
another Another Gay Triumph no notes (38:54 - 39:00)
is the last one supposed to be like an (38:58 - 39:04)
what what is it supposed to be besides (39:00 - 39:06)
the tree it's just an olive tree is that (39:04 - 39:08)
it yeah it's an olive tree but it's also (39:06 - 39:11)
puts its arms up like the victory crown (39:08 - 39:13)
that used to get at the Olympics uh way (39:11 - 39:14)
back in the day the grease that they (39:13 - 39:16)
would wrap around so it's got that feel (39:14 - 39:19)
when its arms are up (39:16 - 39:22)
um so yeah it's a it's a multiple (39:19 - 39:25)
it's multiple things but yes it's mostly (39:22 - 39:27)
a tree (39:25 - 39:27)
uh we got Casper kid and skull villain (39:27 - 39:33)
skull villain which is a play on the (39:31 - 39:36)
Scoville scale or whatever right yeah (39:33 - 39:41)
yeah school villain perfect capsicate (39:36 - 39:41)
bad and bad (39:41 - 39:48)
no school villain is amazing bad perfect (39:42 - 39:48)
no wait I do have a note give a third (39:48 - 39:51)
one with the third head that's my no (39:50 - 39:53)
maybe we'll find that there's a rare (39:51 - 39:56)
chest to evolve a third head isn't this (39:53 - 39:58)
the first fire grass ever the first fire (39:56 - 40:01)
grass which I mean like technically it's (39:58 - 40:04)
grass fire having oh you you well (40:01 - 40:06)
there's one person listening that was (40:04 - 40:08)
was about to write down YouTube comments (40:06 - 40:10)
that it was technically grass fire uh (40:08 - 40:11)
which I think is like really fitting for (40:10 - 40:14)
like incredibly spicy hot peppers right (40:11 - 40:16)
like yeah yeah I don't know if this (40:14 - 40:18)
would see any competitive play like what (40:16 - 40:21)
is grass fire even weak to uh Rock still (40:18 - 40:24)
right flying (40:21 - 40:26)
um (40:24 - 40:26)
not ground uh I mean it's the the hidden (40:28 - 40:35)
ability if we can talk about it that (40:33 - 40:36)
they found (40:35 - 40:41)
um uh Moody yeah fits its face yeah (40:36 - 40:43)
I would maybe would I think the (40:41 - 40:44)
disappointing here thing isn't the (40:43 - 40:46)
design I think the design is fine I mean (40:44 - 40:48)
like it's like a yeah you know it's (40:46 - 40:50)
supposed to be evil looking whatever uh (40:48 - 40:52)
I think the disappointing thing is for a (40:50 - 40:54)
grass fire type it doesn't have like a (40:52 - 40:56)
unique ability to go along with it yeah (40:54 - 40:58)
um it just has chlorophyll insomnia (40:56 - 40:59)
Moody (40:58 - 41:04)
uh belly bolts uh Tad bulb and belly (40:59 - 41:07)
bolt uh Tad bulb is fine it's just like (41:04 - 41:09)
it's whatever it it's the like I Titan (41:07 - 41:13)
Mo slash polywag it's yeah I think it's (41:09 - 41:15)
I think it's fine as well but I I would (41:13 - 41:19)
I want it to be bigger yeah I think it (41:15 - 41:20)
would have been more fun if if Todd bulb (41:19 - 41:22)
was bigger (41:20 - 41:24)
um because (41:22 - 41:26)
well not least because there are so many (41:24 - 41:28)
tiny Pokemon in this game make some big (41:26 - 41:31)
generation is tiny tiny tiny (41:28 - 41:33)
um but also like it just (41:31 - 41:35)
it doesn't feel to scale with belly ball (41:33 - 41:37)
like it's got the same same fake face (41:35 - 41:39)
right or real face I can't remember (41:37 - 41:40)
which one's the real one it's got the (41:39 - 41:43)
same face but their scale is wrong right (41:40 - 41:45)
so it gets bigger as it evolves as like (41:43 - 41:47)
the face gets bigger when it evolves (41:45 - 41:48)
yeah (41:47 - 41:50)
but your face got bigger when you (41:48 - 41:52)
evolved (41:50 - 41:53)
I bet it does it though because your (41:52 - 41:57)
head stays pretty much the same thing (41:53 - 41:59)
please don't tell me it's not true I (41:57 - 42:01)
know it's not true you grow into your (41:59 - 42:03)
ears right yeah you grow into your ears (42:01 - 42:07)
is bigger than percentage-wise of your (42:03 - 42:09)
body than when you're bigger but it does (42:07 - 42:11)
still get bigger (42:09 - 42:13)
I know Greg's not gonna like these next (42:11 - 42:15)
too I think they're great maybe maybe (42:13 - 42:17)
maybe Greg will surprise me we got varum (42:15 - 42:21)
and rev a room (42:17 - 42:21)
room perfect they're so good (42:21 - 42:28)
they're 100 no notes these things are (42:25 - 42:30)
awesome oh what (42:28 - 42:33)
these things are awesome I know you're (42:30 - 42:35)
not a huge fan of like mechanical things (42:33 - 42:37)
I'm not a huge fan of mechanical things (42:35 - 42:40)
and this is this warms my heart this (42:37 - 42:42)
makes the episode worth it that you love (42:40 - 42:45)
these ones this is the one exception (42:42 - 42:48)
to my hatred of mechanical things (42:45 - 42:51)
because it fits the storyline really (42:48 - 42:53)
well (42:51 - 42:53)
um (42:53 - 42:56)
so the car is a Pokemon I was I was I (42:53 - 42:58)
was told strictly by Nintendo never (42:56 - 43:01)
confirmed that the car isn't a Pokemon (42:58 - 43:03)
right multiple Pokemon in there (43:01 - 43:05)
apparently as you do to the story which (43:03 - 43:07)
we'll get to but (43:05 - 43:09)
um I think (43:07 - 43:14)
for a region that they decided to say (43:09 - 43:17)
our main theme is cars (43:14 - 43:22)
this fists like paldea we have cars (43:17 - 43:25)
nobody else has them but we do (43:22 - 43:27)
and here's Pokemon based of course when (43:25 - 43:29)
I saw it I'm like okay yeah cool I get (43:27 - 43:31)
it I like it I think it fits with the (43:29 - 43:34)
poison type fits I think it makes sense (43:31 - 43:38)
I think it it fits the theme I'm like I (43:34 - 43:40)
don't have any notes with it I won't use (43:38 - 43:42)
that one of us I love that one of its (43:40 - 43:45)
abilities the slow start which is really (43:42 - 43:47)
great and totally makes sense (43:45 - 43:51)
yeah his inability a slow start (43:47 - 43:54)
and then it gets filter as its hidden (43:51 - 43:55)
ability from Soul start which is also (43:54 - 43:59)
very good uh again I I think these these (43:55 - 44:01)
these both are really great uh and (43:59 - 44:02)
they're great in the Overworld they got (44:01 - 44:05)
a great shiny as well yeah the shiny is (44:02 - 44:06)
really good (44:05 - 44:08)
yeah I'm pretty happy with these Al any (44:06 - 44:10)
more thoughts (44:08 - 44:11)
I I think you're right around about the (44:10 - 44:14)
Overworld they are so fast and but not (44:11 - 44:15)
in a terrifying way just something like (44:14 - 44:18)
oh another one got me great uh you don't (44:15 - 44:19)
feel like they're gonna kill you but you (44:18 - 44:23)
have to keep keep a watch for them (44:19 - 44:23)
um we have oathworm which is the place (44:23 - 44:31)
earthworm yeah like earthworm uh it it's (44:26 - 44:32)
it's a (44:31 - 44:34)
it's weird because it does look like a (44:32 - 44:36)
worm and then when the animation it has (44:34 - 44:38)
like the wiggler arms that pop out of it (44:36 - 44:41)
uh which is I thought there'd be more (44:38 - 44:43)
here uh I thought it would evolve or (44:41 - 44:49)
something it's just a worm it's just bad (44:43 - 44:51)
it's fine I know some people really like (44:49 - 44:55)
it uh yeah they're wrong (44:51 - 44:55)
it's just Steel type two and there's no (44:55 - 45:01)
secondary type (44:59 - 45:05)
which is weird why not grind yeah (45:01 - 45:07)
designed off an earthworm I don't (45:05 - 45:09)
understand whatever (45:07 - 45:12)
uh we have I don't know maybe a girl I (45:09 - 45:14)
mean uh we have tandemous and then Mouse (45:12 - 45:19)
hold uh which uh (45:14 - 45:19)
you know not only we gotta appeal to the (45:19 - 45:23)
gays we gotta appeal to the polyamorous (45:21 - 45:25)
people here because you you put in two (45:23 - 45:27)
two mouse families in a daycare and (45:25 - 45:28)
you're getting another mouse family it (45:27 - 45:29)
is real (45:28 - 45:32)
let's not ask any questions I love (45:29 - 45:33)
tandemouse though and I love Mouse holes (45:32 - 45:37)
they're really cute yeah one if you look (45:33 - 45:39)
really closely one is wearing pants one (45:37 - 45:41)
is wearing a shirt for whatever reason (45:39 - 45:43)
oh I never noticed that I think that's (45:41 - 45:45)
pretty great (45:43 - 45:47)
um my only issue with these Pokemon is (45:45 - 45:49)
the shiny is terrible yeah like (45:47 - 45:51)
literally (45:49 - 45:54)
which is really hard to notice I don't (45:51 - 45:56)
yeah we can talk to Chinese please the (45:54 - 45:59)
bad decisions they made around Chinese (45:56 - 46:02)
do we do we know the three and four (45:59 - 46:04)
thing is this the same as just the the (46:02 - 46:08)
how far it's the Dunsparce it's random (46:04 - 46:10)
as well I don't think we know like if (46:08 - 46:11)
there's any waiting like there is with (46:10 - 46:14)
with the dance bars but yeah it's random (46:11 - 46:14)
again (46:14 - 46:15)
[Music] (46:14 - 46:16)
um (46:15 - 46:18)
I I like these are probably my favorite (46:16 - 46:19)
honestly of the generation are these (46:18 - 46:21)
these mice I really think they're super (46:19 - 46:24)
cute they're cute (46:21 - 46:25)
and their names are really good because (46:24 - 46:27)
it's like I didn't real it's like a (46:25 - 46:29)
tandem bike right yeah (46:27 - 46:33)
Tandem and then they're a household (46:29 - 46:35)
I think they're leak in the video a few (46:33 - 46:37)
months ago was part was perfect because (46:35 - 46:40)
they look like a placeholder because (46:37 - 46:43)
they're so like white and generic they (46:40 - 46:45)
look like it was just a random (46:43 - 46:48)
placeholder image yeah I think so I (46:45 - 46:50)
think the like accidental there's new (46:48 - 46:52)
Pokemon in the compass in the corner I (46:50 - 46:54)
think now this was on purpose because (46:52 - 46:56)
you would have never guessed that the (46:54 - 46:59)
two mice were supposed to be together (46:56 - 47:02)
the entire time and the tail didn't (46:59 - 47:05)
matter like I said yeah the tail well (47:02 - 47:07)
the well the tail didn't well I think (47:05 - 47:09)
the tail is the one on the shirt and the (47:07 - 47:13)
yeah anyways I think they're great (47:09 - 47:16)
um uh so we have to Titan and so Titan (47:13 - 47:19)
did have a pre-evolution it was a total (47:16 - 47:22)
which is like a plan (47:19 - 47:22)
uh which is super cute holy cow I love (47:22 - 47:28)
it it's guilt (47:25 - 47:28)
I don't think they're different enough (47:29 - 47:34)
they are trying to figure out which one (47:31 - 47:36)
is which when I see them out no they are (47:34 - 47:38)
I mean one has one horn and the other (47:36 - 47:40)
has lots of horns yeah but you have to (47:38 - 47:42)
remember that right like it's not it's (47:40 - 47:44)
not it's not different enough in my (47:42 - 47:47)
opinion when you grow up you get more (47:44 - 47:50)
horns everybody knows this yes you grow (47:47 - 47:52)
into your heart into your heart (47:50 - 47:54)
[Laughter] (47:52 - 47:57)
uh we just have a couple more here we (47:54 - 48:00)
have uh frigid backs our Arky Archie (47:57 - 48:03)
backs and back scabbler uh which okay (48:00 - 48:08)
fridge backs artifacts Max caliber yes (48:03 - 48:10)
please get it correct they're going to (48:08 - 48:12)
insult my new child (48:10 - 48:15)
oh you like this one too oh my God this (48:12 - 48:19)
ice Godzilla yes one thousand percent (48:15 - 48:21)
now I'm not Spencer (48:19 - 48:24)
like but I love me guy Godzilla and Ice (48:21 - 48:30)
Godzilla I spent I kid you not I spent (48:24 - 48:30)
seven hours (48:30 - 48:35)
trying to find this (48:33 - 48:38)
it's just so I can have it and I found (48:35 - 48:41)
two one that has a dark Terror type I (48:38 - 48:43)
will change it whatever but I've (48:41 - 48:45)
literally spent hours (48:43 - 48:48)
finding this because it is the greatest (48:45 - 48:50)
thing that has ever been created I love (48:48 - 48:53)
it if everybody speaks bad about it (48:50 - 48:55)
you will be kicked out it is in the top (48:53 - 48:56)
ten (48:55 - 48:59)
I'm figuring out who I'm kicking out I (48:56 - 49:02)
don't know yet but it is amazing I love (48:59 - 49:06)
ice Godzilla and I (49:02 - 49:10)
will cherish ice Godzilla forever (49:06 - 49:13)
so uh I didn't think anything for me (49:10 - 49:15)
could pass so if we're talking to pseudo (49:13 - 49:17)
pseudo legendaries you know the dragon (49:15 - 49:20)
of the generation or whatever I didn't (49:17 - 49:22)
think anything could surpass Dragon pulp (49:20 - 49:24)
for me they got they got big shoes to (49:22 - 49:27)
fill for Dragon Ball I adore and love (49:24 - 49:31)
dragon Paul on so many levels uh I back (49:27 - 49:34)
caliber for me does not come close at (49:31 - 49:38)
all no you're wrong and it did it's (49:34 - 49:39)
Godzilla right like it's obviously (49:38 - 49:43)
Godzilla Vibes it's ice Godzuki and Ice (49:39 - 49:46)
Godzilla what more do you want from a (49:43 - 49:49)
Pokemon I want Al's opinion (49:46 - 49:50)
it's fine (49:49 - 49:52)
[Laughter] (49:50 - 49:54)
all right you're both getting back to (49:52 - 49:56)
pokedexes this professor is revoking (49:54 - 49:58)
your license (49:56 - 50:01)
Greg Greg you did not see (49:58 - 50:03)
if anybody doesn't say it's the greatest (50:01 - 50:04)
thing you said if anybody speaks bad (50:03 - 50:06)
about it I'm not speaking bad about it I (50:04 - 50:08)
don't have any issues with it I'm just (50:06 - 50:10)
not in love with it I like the middle (50:08 - 50:12)
Evo I do like the middle Evo (50:10 - 50:14)
I think the middle Evo has a lot of (50:12 - 50:15)
character to it (50:14 - 50:19)
oh okay I don't like the first one I (50:15 - 50:21)
believe it was the most boring thing in (50:19 - 50:22)
the world (50:21 - 50:24)
he's a little chunky boy with a beauty (50:22 - 50:26)
mark he is chunky that's true I do like (50:24 - 50:28)
a little charger okay let's talk about (50:26 - 50:30)
tosuguri and I gotta scroll back up here (50:28 - 50:33)
to uh Dondo so I like saying the word (50:30 - 50:35)
dandozo (50:33 - 50:37)
um you know maybe the leaks maybe uh (50:35 - 50:38)
assume that this would have been like a (50:37 - 50:41)
wish cash Evolution it is a giant Sushi (50:38 - 50:43)
fish whale (50:41 - 50:46)
uh we got a lot of whales but yeah a lot (50:43 - 50:47)
of whales now (50:46 - 50:49)
um there's a there's a gimmick here in (50:47 - 50:51)
double battles where uh so there are (50:49 - 50:53)
three Sushi's tassagiri there are three (50:51 - 50:55)
of them there's an orange one uh a pink (50:53 - 50:57)
one and a yellow one they're like (50:55 - 50:59)
different forms like stringy form curly (50:57 - 51:03)
form something else uh they don't have (50:59 - 51:05)
anything particular right like the (51:03 - 51:06)
yellow one isn't stronger than the (51:05 - 51:08)
orange one what it does do is if you're (51:06 - 51:10)
in a double battle with tusuguri and (51:08 - 51:13)
dantozzo because of tosuguri's ability (51:10 - 51:15)
Commander dondoza will eat that and (51:13 - 51:18)
depending on which color it is dandoza (51:15 - 51:19)
will get a boost so like an attack boost (51:18 - 51:21)
a speed boost or I think a defense boost (51:19 - 51:23)
are the three based off the colors (51:21 - 51:25)
um tusuguri also has three different (51:23 - 51:26)
shinies so (51:25 - 51:30)
uh there's a yellow a brown and an (51:26 - 51:33)
orange uh I know that does the the (51:30 - 51:36)
normal colors are are pink orange and (51:33 - 51:39)
yellow so uh that's a little weird I (51:36 - 51:41)
mean that's purpose shinies are (51:39 - 51:43)
purposeful at this point they are (51:41 - 51:45)
purposely giving us applicatoros for (51:43 - 51:48)
example uh they know what they're doing (51:45 - 51:48)
um (51:48 - 51:50)
so I do feel like we have to talk to (51:48 - 51:54)
these in a in a pair uh I I like them (51:50 - 51:55)
both I think they're really great and I (51:54 - 51:58)
think the animations (51:55 - 51:58)
his little thing makes like a sushi chef (51:59 - 52:05)
on his head oh yeah I mean I I it's fine (52:02 - 52:08)
but tatsuguri is (52:05 - 52:12)
adorable a thousand percent yes want a (52:08 - 52:15)
million of them just all around me (52:12 - 52:17)
love it (52:15 - 52:19)
yeah I I think the fun um especially (52:17 - 52:21)
like how they integrated into the story (52:19 - 52:22)
which obviously we can't talk about just (52:21 - 52:25)
now but um I think that that yeah makes (52:22 - 52:26)
me like it more I think if it was just (52:25 - 52:28)
on their own they'd be fine but with (52:26 - 52:30)
that that story element I think it was (52:28 - 52:32)
really good yeah and them being together (52:30 - 52:37)
but not together is is great too uh we (52:32 - 52:41)
have palmy palmo palmat (52:37 - 52:41)
do we call this a Pikachu clone now that (52:42 - 52:48)
we know it evolves oh yeah okay yeah (52:44 - 52:50)
it's electrical fighting which is (52:48 - 52:53)
besides this is the first electric (52:50 - 52:55)
fighting I believe ever I think Sarah (52:53 - 52:57)
Aura should have been electric fighting (52:55 - 53:00)
uh it's not (52:57 - 53:00)
it's it's fine uh I think it's fun and (53:00 - 53:06)
not just because it was my first shiny (53:05 - 53:08)
in the games right not just because of (53:06 - 53:09)
that (53:08 - 53:13)
um the the evolution method from Pomo to (53:09 - 53:14)
palmot is (53:13 - 53:18)
interesting but too long right too long (53:14 - 53:20)
I like that you have to walk it to (53:18 - 53:22)
evolve it but it seems not to be (53:20 - 53:24)
cumulative it seems to be just like in (53:22 - 53:27)
one watt yeah and it's a thousand steps (53:24 - 53:29)
yeah and I just sat there counting and (53:27 - 53:31)
oh my word it takes a long time to walk (53:29 - 53:33)
a thousand steps in this game that was (53:31 - 53:37)
yeah not fun and it's so easy to get it (53:33 - 53:38)
back to go back in the Pokeball (53:37 - 53:39)
accidentally if you walk too far away (53:38 - 53:42)
from it or if you press the button to to (53:39 - 53:43)
do it and you're in the wrong direction (53:42 - 53:47)
or just oh no like 100 steps fine do a (53:43 - 53:48)
hundred step a thousand steps is two (53:47 - 53:50)
yeah (53:48 - 53:53)
a thousand steps to change you into this (53:50 - 53:54)
Evolution and I don't care anymore (53:53 - 53:56)
trying to get that Pokemon go time we (53:54 - 54:00)
have watchroll and kilowattroll love it (53:56 - 54:01)
here's our journey of birds and then we (54:00 - 54:04)
have bombarder we have squawkabilly uh (54:01 - 54:07)
we have flamigo uh we got a lot of birds (54:04 - 54:10)
here a lot of them a lot of single Birds (54:07 - 54:11)
hmm (54:10 - 54:14)
I I like them all I don't think any of (54:11 - 54:16)
them are like huge standouts I think wow (54:14 - 54:18)
Patrol has that like really dumb bird (54:16 - 54:20)
look going on you know you compare it to (54:18 - 54:24)
the pig the the Spiro or the whatever (54:20 - 54:26)
bird of the generation you you're not a (54:24 - 54:27)
three-stage bird but a bro but a (54:26 - 54:30)
two-stage bird it's like a swallow or or (54:27 - 54:31)
Taylor (54:30 - 54:34)
uh electric flying great type I mean (54:31 - 54:36)
like again I I think they're they're the (54:34 - 54:38)
the birds from uh Finding Nemo right (54:36 - 54:41)
like the mine mine mine mine mine yeah (54:38 - 54:43)
there's seagulls seagulls into the (54:41 - 54:45)
albatra I think I'll slash albatross (54:43 - 54:48)
is the size of an albatross and it's (54:45 - 54:50)
kind of got an albatrossy face but yes (54:48 - 54:54)
it is uh is a lot of seagull in there (54:50 - 54:56)
ah yeah it's they're they're fine I've (54:54 - 54:58)
not really given them much thought to be (54:56 - 54:59)
honest I think they're I think they're (54:58 - 55:00)
good I think they're super cute but I'm (54:59 - 55:02)
not using one (55:00 - 55:06)
uh bombarder just is uh the uh (55:02 - 55:09)
historically we have that storage (55:06 - 55:12)
checklist but check again (55:09 - 55:14)
no no you're pronouncing it wrong again (55:12 - 55:15)
it's not Bombardier it's clearly (55:14 - 55:18)
Bombardier (55:15 - 55:20)
it's meant to be like Bombardier it's (55:18 - 55:23)
Bombardier Bombardier doesn't it have (55:20 - 55:26)
like uh it has like move that Kos itself (55:23 - 55:27)
right (55:26 - 55:28)
I think (55:27 - 55:29)
um I think the first time I ran into one (55:28 - 55:31)
it just I was like oh I guess I'm not (55:29 - 55:33)
catching you goodbye (55:31 - 55:35)
I mean (55:33 - 55:38)
it has parting shot (55:35 - 55:39)

have memento (55:41 - 55:46)
yeah momento uh Rocky payload uh squawka (55:42 - 55:47)
Billy there are four this this was (55:46 - 55:50)
another Pokemon I saw early uh it was in (55:47 - 55:53)
the um the the mini map screenshot I (55:50 - 55:55)
think the green one was there are four (55:53 - 55:57)
colors uh (55:55 - 56:03)
can't remember what the four colors do (55:57 - 56:05)
I I think they're just they're just (56:03 - 56:06)
colors I don't think they do it aren't (56:05 - 56:09)
they I thought they did something not (56:06 - 56:11)
like competitively but (56:09 - 56:14)
I mean the colors are based off of (56:11 - 56:17)
like green like cities (56:14 - 56:23)
uh blue likes forests yellow likes (56:17 - 56:26)
fighting like like their Pokedex or (56:23 - 56:28)
something but I don't think they (56:26 - 56:31)
their colors actually do anything to (56:28 - 56:34)
them not that I've seen it yeah I'm not (56:31 - 56:35)
I'm not seeing anything other than just (56:34 - 56:39)
the the different Pokedex entries uh (56:35 - 56:42)
I think that's maybe the the most (56:39 - 56:45)
controversial Pokemon Flamingo Flamingo (56:42 - 56:46)
is the greatest thing that's ever (56:45 - 56:50)
existed it is it is not fair really it (56:46 - 56:53)
is it it is not it is not fairy it is (56:50 - 56:54)
flying fighting which is the same as (56:53 - 56:57)
Hawlucha are we just doing that thing (56:54 - 56:58)
again we're seeing every pink Pokemon (56:57 - 57:00)
should be Theory right what about oh (56:58 - 57:01)
yeah yeah yeah yeah that's the (57:00 - 57:04)
stereotype right like I don't (57:01 - 57:04)
I feel like even if they didn't show a (57:07 - 57:11)
flamingo if they're if you're like hey (57:09 - 57:12)
think of a flamingo Pokemon what would (57:11 - 57:13)
you want it to be I feel like most (57:12 - 57:15)
people default to like oh it should be (57:13 - 57:17)
like fairy I know I think most people (57:15 - 57:20)
defaulted to be fire (57:17 - 57:21)
flamingo (57:20 - 57:24)
no I was thinking flying water because (57:21 - 57:26)
it's like I would I mean I know flying (57:24 - 57:28)
water is boating and overdone but like (57:26 - 57:29)
it's a water bird (57:28 - 57:31)
I mean they could do like fairy water (57:29 - 57:33)
there's only two other ones uh primarina (57:31 - 57:36)
and tapufini right maybe there's a third (57:33 - 57:38)
one anyways uh they remove a letter it's (57:36 - 57:41)
flamigo and I think I think this (57:38 - 57:44)
generation whether or not you agree with (57:41 - 57:46)
some of the designs because the the (57:44 - 57:48)
designs of a Pokemon are always going to (57:46 - 57:50)
be preference yeah right of whether or (57:48 - 57:51)
not you like spiders or birds or (57:50 - 57:55)
Dolphins yeah or or how they did those I (57:51 - 57:57)
think this generation really (57:55 - 58:00)
Nails it with names (57:57 - 58:03)
and like even if you're like like when I (58:00 - 58:06)
first saw when I first saw flamigo in my (58:03 - 58:07)
preview I was like I know people are (58:06 - 58:09)
gonna like it because it's a flamingo (58:07 - 58:11)
right like we did it we hit that (58:09 - 58:13)
checklist and I was like it didn't (58:11 - 58:14)
really like I couldn't like say because (58:13 - 58:18)
I was under NDA that like it's like you (58:14 - 58:20)
saw Flamingo like what does it look like (58:18 - 58:21)
what's the cool thing and it's like how (58:20 - 58:23)
do I say that it just looks like a flame (58:21 - 58:25)
this looks like a flamingo and that is (58:23 - 58:26)
the greatest thing they've done it's (58:25 - 58:28)
just a flamingo and I love it and and (58:26 - 58:32)
the name really sold me out yeah it's (58:28 - 58:34)
the name is so good and to be fair like (58:32 - 58:36)
just because it looks like a flamingo I (58:34 - 58:37)
don't think that's a big deal we have (58:36 - 58:39)
rat attack we have Pidgey we have we (58:37 - 58:42)
have a rock with arms like we have so (58:39 - 58:45)
many like it's just this kind of thing (58:42 - 58:48)
and that's that's part of the charm of a (58:45 - 58:49)
lot of Pokemon (58:48 - 58:52)
so I I think the Design's fine right I (58:49 - 58:54)
don't love it I don't hate it it's fine (58:52 - 58:55)
I I get that people like it I'm not (58:54 - 58:56)
gonna (58:55 - 58:59)
but the name I think is a crime right (58:56 - 59:04)
this name is as bad as seal right I do (58:59 - 59:06)
not understand (59:04 - 59:09)
I do not understand how people like this (59:06 - 59:11)
name (59:09 - 59:11)
and I went I I laughed I was just like (59:14 - 59:21)
this is ridiculous they put the least (59:18 - 59:23)
thought possible into this name they put (59:21 - 59:25)
the most thought it's your flying friend (59:23 - 59:29)
nope Migo no (59:25 - 59:32)
fly it's great you're reading too much (59:29 - 59:34)
into it it's not you're not really (59:32 - 59:36)
enough I do it because yeah (59:34 - 59:39)
uh we have uh I can't say any of these (59:36 - 59:41)
names the salt the salt's Minecraft (59:39 - 59:44)
Pokemon next (59:41 - 59:48)
gargant nickel (59:44 - 59:48)
uh the first one I think is great the (59:48 - 59:52)
last one I think is okay the middle one (59:51 - 59:54)
just screams Minecraft to me but it's (59:52 - 59:57)
Minecraft Minecraft no no it's not it's (59:54 - 60:00)
Mario Minecraft Minecraft it's clearly a (59:57 - 60:03)
Mario power-up yeah (60:00 - 60:03)
it turns Mario into assault for the for (60:03 - 60:09)
the record I don't I don't think like me (60:05 - 60:12)
calling it Minecraft I don't it's not me (60:09 - 60:15)
like hating on it it just reminds me of (60:12 - 60:17)
Minecraft I don't think that's a bad (60:15 - 60:19)
thing I know people who love it I'm like (60:17 - 60:20)
it's okay yeah there are a lot of people (60:19 - 60:23)
that love it uh we have glimit and (60:20 - 60:25)
glamora which (60:23 - 60:27)
I still don't know what this is supposed (60:25 - 60:29)
to be I mean it's like floating in a (60:27 - 60:32)
case like an ore (60:29 - 60:34)
I think it's very much like (60:32 - 60:37)
um what was it called (60:34 - 60:39)
the the not the answer one (60:37 - 60:41)
Carbink (60:39 - 60:42)
yeah Carbink I think it's just meant to (60:41 - 60:44)
be like an ore (60:42 - 60:46)
yeah I thought it was psychic when I (60:44 - 60:47)
first saw it because it was just kind of (60:46 - 60:50)
floating there menacingly (60:47 - 60:51)
um (60:50 - 60:53)
I I this is a Pokemon I have to come (60:51 - 60:55)
back to in like a month and give you (60:53 - 60:57)
like more thoughts it's just I don't (60:55 - 61:00)
care for it it's weird just the cave (60:57 - 61:02)
that they live in by the way they they (61:00 - 61:04)
can have a mouse at Mass outbreak that (61:02 - 61:06)
is the worst mass outbreak in the world (61:04 - 61:09)
to do shark (61:06 - 61:11)
uh oh I've not done the shark but no I (61:09 - 61:14)
just I'm not I had that yesterday I (61:11 - 61:17)
liked it 10 like picnic resets and I (61:14 - 61:18)
gave up I was like I'm not doing this (61:17 - 61:20)
because you cannot picnic in the cave (61:18 - 61:23)
you have to go out the cave and then (61:20 - 61:24)
swim a bunch and then do it and then (61:23 - 61:27)
come back it's terrible uh we have (61:24 - 61:29)
strudel uh the pre-evolution of graphite (61:27 - 61:31)
eye uh I think it's cute it's good cute (61:29 - 61:34)
yeah yeah really cute knocked out of the (61:31 - 61:36)
park there for pre-evolution (61:34 - 61:38)
um we got our journey of dogs we got (61:36 - 61:43)
Fido Dosh Dash buns Dosh buns uh Mastiff (61:38 - 61:46)
mess boss stiff Greg you were zero for (61:43 - 61:48)
one on dogs give me the dog update here (61:46 - 61:51)
uh all right so I'm gonna ask you the (61:48 - 61:55)
question of these four dogs (61:51 - 61:59)
which one kicked the chunk off my team (61:55 - 62:04)
massive absolutely mashiff love love (61:59 - 62:06)
that poor little sad bad dog oh he's so (62:04 - 62:08)
cute and Angies I thought you didn't (62:06 - 62:10)
like sad Pokemon like you didn't like (62:08 - 62:14)
that's sad he's he's got a traumatic (62:10 - 62:16)
past he's an angry pup that needs to be (62:14 - 62:19)
reformed he just needs love and I gave (62:16 - 62:22)
him love and he became a super good boy (62:19 - 62:23)
and you like must you like the (62:22 - 62:26)
evolutions of these dogs yeah I mean the (62:23 - 62:28)
mob boss thing is a little overdone (62:26 - 62:29)
because you have hanch Crow but I'm like (62:28 - 62:33)
oh it the design is is cute (62:29 - 62:33)
nothing on the The Bagel the the what (62:34 - 62:38)
fight out Fido and dash button they're (62:37 - 62:40)
good Evolutions like the evolution makes (62:38 - 62:45)
sense and it's um well-baked body is a (62:40 - 62:47)
very good ability yeah like it's great (62:45 - 62:51)
it fits the butt of the four dogs like (62:47 - 62:53)
I'm like oh that's (62:51 - 62:57)
okay there are bet there are there are (62:53 - 63:00)
much better fairy types so (62:57 - 63:02)
yeah I like dashboard but yeah I think (63:00 - 63:04)
if we're if we're if we're going to pick (63:02 - 63:07)
one to talk about mashif and my boss (63:04 - 63:11)
oh my God better dashboard feels like a (63:07 - 63:12)
Pokemon that is like infiltrating EV (63:11 - 63:16)
fans like they need they they yeah this (63:12 - 63:18)
is your bread Evolution like it has (63:16 - 63:20)
enough it has enough characteristics (63:18 - 63:22)
where like EV fans are also on life (63:20 - 63:24)
support right now yeah (63:22 - 63:27)
but Mastiff and my boss stiffer (63:24 - 63:31)
brilliant no no um we have uh we have (63:27 - 63:34)
bramblin and bramble gas which are there (63:31 - 63:37)
two of these because it evolves why why (63:34 - 63:39)
why why does it evolve and okay right if (63:37 - 63:40)
it was going to evolve why does it (63:39 - 63:43)
evolve into just slightly thornier right (63:40 - 63:45)
if you're gonna evolve right a (63:43 - 63:47)
tumbleweed Pokemon make it like a (63:45 - 63:50)
massive pile of Tumbleweed don't just (63:47 - 63:52)
make it a slightly thought it's no no (63:50 - 63:55)
it's eyes it's not slightly thornier it (63:52 - 63:59)
gets a smile and a nose yeah true it's (63:55 - 64:00)
true it's another one of those Pokemon (63:59 - 64:02)
where you have to walk to evolve in the (64:00 - 64:04)
game right I believe this is a this is (64:02 - 64:06)
bad I do not like this yeah another (64:04 - 64:07)
another (64:06 - 64:09)
I think brambling is good Bramble guess (64:07 - 64:10)
bad (64:09 - 64:14)
it's it's the same uh I I would assume (64:10 - 64:16)
like they do make Pokemon based on other (64:14 - 64:17)
Pokemon (64:16 - 64:20)
with with the intention of them being (64:17 - 64:22)
similar but not the same obviously they (64:20 - 64:24)
did this with Wiglet and Diglett uh I (64:22 - 64:26)
think people can point to uh love disc (64:24 - 64:29)
and alolomola like why don't they evolve (64:26 - 64:30)
like just because things look the same (64:29 - 64:32)
doesn't mean yeah I get it I do think (64:30 - 64:35)
that this might be a tie to Del mice now (64:32 - 64:36)
people are like Steve dunmies is an (64:35 - 64:37)
anchor what are you talking about no (64:36 - 64:40)
you're wrong Del Mize is the seaweed is (64:37 - 64:41)
the seaweed on the anchor that's why (64:40 - 64:45)
it's grass ghost it is possessed seaweed (64:41 - 64:48)
that takes over the anchor (64:45 - 64:51)
um so I got real big Del Mize vibes from (64:48 - 64:52)
this dumb eyes could technically take (64:51 - 64:55)
over like a boat right and but delmize (64:52 - 64:57)
would still be delmized it's the seaweed (64:55 - 65:00)
uh so anyways I think it's cool in that (64:57 - 65:02)
aspect but I agree I think the uh (65:00 - 65:03)
evolutionary is a little disappointing I (65:02 - 65:05)
think bramblin had like oh cool (65:03 - 65:07)
Tumbleweed great potential and then it's (65:05 - 65:09)
like oh just (65:07 - 65:09)
yeah yeah it's not even bigger though (65:09 - 65:15)
it's just more it's just gotta smile (65:12 - 65:18)
okay uh so we have gimme ghoul I think a (65:15 - 65:19)
lot of people thought gimmigo was maybe (65:18 - 65:21)
like a stable eye of this generation or (65:19 - 65:22)
something kind of a standalone it does (65:21 - 65:27)
evolve into uh how do we say this (65:22 - 65:32)
and gold gold and gold gold then go (65:27 - 65:35)
um has the ability good as gold uh I (65:32 - 65:36)
think so I saw some people compare this (65:35 - 65:40)
to Gumby uh which might out date (65:36 - 65:44)
something no it's not Gumby it's worse (65:40 - 65:47)
it is the cheese string the string (65:44 - 65:49)
cheese mascot and I hate it I hate them (65:47 - 65:53)
I hate it so the the speculation is this (65:49 - 65:55)
is the a thousandth Pokemon uh because (65:53 - 65:58)
it takes a thousand coins to evolve (65:55 - 66:03)
gimme ghoul 999. oh yeah okay true (65:58 - 66:07)
they could be Pokedex 999 we don't know (66:03 - 66:09)
who a thousand is or this is the a (66:07 - 66:10)
thousandth right (66:09 - 66:12)
that's that's because we don't actually (66:10 - 66:13)
know the Pokedex order (66:12 - 66:16)
we don't I think if you take the the (66:13 - 66:18)
Pokemon in there (66:16 - 66:21)
Regional decks order it's not this one (66:18 - 66:23)
which is there's another assumption that (66:21 - 66:24)
people are making we've not talked about (66:23 - 66:26)
that one yet is that agent I think is (66:24 - 66:29)
that area zero I think no I think it was (66:26 - 66:30)
Tinker Tink (66:29 - 66:32)
or one of the Tinker tank line is is if (66:30 - 66:35)
you go in order would be a thousand but (66:32 - 66:37)
that they haven't always done that so (66:35 - 66:39)
that's a an assumption (66:37 - 66:41)
uh by the way I love this Pokemon I (66:39 - 66:43)
think he's I think he's so I think he (66:41 - 66:46)
hits that so silly so dumb like all gold (66:43 - 66:51)
like I'm very into it I hate I hate it (66:46 - 66:54)
with a burning passion it is the string (66:51 - 66:59)
cheese mascot worse it is bad (66:54 - 66:59)
nothing can ever be nice because it's in (67:00 - 67:05)
Gold I saw it he's good as gold he's (67:03 - 67:09)
good as gold he's bad he's bad he's bad (67:05 - 67:12)
as a gold-based economy (67:09 - 67:14)
um it's just every time I look at him I (67:12 - 67:16)
guess this it's either you think of the (67:14 - 67:19)
string cheese mascot or the wiggly (67:16 - 67:22)
balloons outside of car dealerships both (67:19 - 67:25)
bad it's just bad (67:22 - 67:28)
I didn't think of the I know the Balloon (67:25 - 67:30)
Guys (67:28 - 67:30)
Greg thank you good as good as snow bad (67:30 - 67:40)
uh we have Tinka Tink Tinka tough Tinker (67:36 - 67:42)
Time (67:40 - 67:45)
amazing win win win win win we thought (67:42 - 67:48)
we could get Amy from Sonic in Pokemon (67:45 - 67:51)
you look at this Pokemon line there's (67:48 - 67:52)
some Pokemon that you just look at and (67:51 - 67:55)
you go people are gonna love I love this (67:52 - 67:56)
so (67:55 - 67:59)
whereas we had a whole thing serving the (67:56 - 68:02)
gays we finally have a powerful (67:59 - 68:05)
incredible lesbian coming in to get work (68:02 - 68:07)
done (68:05 - 68:12)
tinkerton has ticket on I moved many (68:07 - 68:15)
things off my team to put a ticket on my (68:12 - 68:18)
team this Pokemon is incredible this is (68:15 - 68:22)
another top tenor love tinkerton uh it (68:18 - 68:24)
is 100 female (68:22 - 68:25)
yep (68:24 - 68:27)
um you know just putting out there you (68:25 - 68:29)
know Jinx is 50 or doing some matchings (68:27 - 68:30)
um (68:29 - 68:33)
uh well Mr mime is 50 50. (68:30 - 68:35)
what was the other gorbus is 50 50 just (68:33 - 68:37)
from for there was that weird thing (68:35 - 68:39)
where Pokemon go people thought like oh (68:37 - 68:41)
huntail's the male one gorbus is the (68:39 - 68:42)
female one but this is a is there a 100 (68:41 - 68:44)
male that I'm missing I mean we have (68:42 - 68:47)
hazarene was 100 female in Galler and (68:44 - 68:50)
then grim star was 100 ml am I missing (68:47 - 68:52)
the mail here (68:50 - 68:53)
I don't think there's an equivalent no (68:52 - 68:56)
there's no counterpart at least not that (68:53 - 68:58)
I've seen (68:56 - 68:59)
um we have char Cadet which is another (68:58 - 69:02)
Pokemon I saw early in the preview (68:59 - 69:03)
um I didn't I actually just thought it (69:02 - 69:05)
was gonna evolve into armories but this (69:03 - 69:08)
is the the split a Evo here now uh (69:05 - 69:10)
misinformation around this as well (69:08 - 69:12)
um these Pokemon are technically version (69:10 - 69:16)
exclusive in the sense that the items (69:12 - 69:20)
like yeah it's like apple so if you if (69:16 - 69:23)
if you know Greg collects two of the (69:20 - 69:26)
items needed for Arma Rouge he could (69:23 - 69:27)
keep one for himself and then he could (69:26 - 69:29)
put one on um you know a strudel and (69:27 - 69:30)
trade me the strudel and then I could (69:29 - 69:34)
evolve it so it's very apple and in that (69:30 - 69:36)
sense yeah (69:34 - 69:36)
is my precious child and (69:39 - 69:45)
Brent saw it and said I love that thing (69:43 - 69:47)
you know Greg you came into this I (69:45 - 69:49)
thought you were gonna hate way more (69:47 - 69:51)
than you led on you you seem to like (69:49 - 69:53)
quite a bit here (69:51 - 69:55)
I mean no no good it's gold but what is (69:53 - 69:58)
oh good get out (69:55 - 70:01)
I'm revoking your Pokemon license as the (69:58 - 70:03)
official professor of the reason get out (70:01 - 70:07)
go back to Kalos you do not belong here (70:03 - 70:08)
ah we have (70:07 - 70:10)
go ahead (70:08 - 70:13)
I think that I'm gonna say it's I think (70:10 - 70:15)
it's pronounced Sharky day rather than (70:13 - 70:18)
Target but we'll see (70:15 - 70:20)
um but I think that is the best of this (70:18 - 70:22)
line (70:20 - 70:25)
oh you get out yeah I don't I mean I (70:22 - 70:26)
said this before I don't really care for (70:25 - 70:28)
the evolutions but I don't know I'm not (70:26 - 70:30)
a huge experience (70:28 - 70:33)
uh Chuck it is adorable (70:30 - 70:35)
uh speaking of Bisharp I guess we'll (70:33 - 70:38)
just talk about King Gambit can get (70:35 - 70:41)
Gambit King Gambit (70:38 - 70:44)
uh it the bit hey look Bishop evolved (70:41 - 70:45)
that's pretty cool (70:44 - 70:46)
um no I don't think anyone's upset about (70:45 - 70:49)
that Bisharp fans the three of them out (70:46 - 70:54)
there Overjoyed I'm sure uh I like (70:49 - 70:56)
I'm not sure if anyone has ever (70:54 - 70:58)
encountered one of these uh in the wild (70:56 - 71:00)
or in the game but uh he's like he comes (70:58 - 71:02)
out of his pokeball sitting on a rock (71:00 - 71:05)
which I think is just fantastic Samurai (71:02 - 71:08)
waiting for you to challenge and I don't (71:05 - 71:10)
think that the like screenshots are just (71:08 - 71:12)
looking at on cerebii really does it (71:10 - 71:15)
justice until you see it in battle (71:12 - 71:17)
um and I feel like it makes it even more (71:15 - 71:18)
intimidating that he comes out of his (71:17 - 71:21)
pokeball and he just sits down yeah he's (71:18 - 71:22)
just he knows that it's a one and done (71:21 - 71:25)
baby yeah you didn't even see my sword (71:22 - 71:27)
moving you're dead (71:25 - 71:31)
so yeah I'm very happy like Bishop got (71:27 - 71:34)
an evolution uh I I I I I do like that (71:31 - 71:35)
they're revisiting these Pokemon I mean (71:34 - 71:37)
like that was a big thing of Gen 4 is (71:35 - 71:39)
like let's give a bunch of Pokemon third (71:37 - 71:43)
Evolutions uh Meg mortar uh Togekiss uh (71:39 - 71:45)
electivire (71:43 - 71:46)
um (71:45 - 71:48)
and so they're kind of starting to touch (71:46 - 71:50)
back and and and and clean some of those (71:48 - 71:52)
Pokemon up uh I know we're skipping (71:50 - 71:53)
around but speaking of third Evolutions (71:52 - 71:57)
probably one of the best annihilate uh (71:53 - 72:00)
which is the evolution of primeape (71:57 - 72:04)
um did you guys read its pokedex entry (72:00 - 72:08)
I haven't evolved one yet but okay so it (72:04 - 72:09)
is fire ghost it is the evolution of (72:08 - 72:11)
primate the Pokedex entry I'll just (72:09 - 72:13)
paraphrase for it pretty much says that (72:11 - 72:19)
primeape got so mad it died it died (72:13 - 72:19)
absolutely (72:21 - 72:27)
incredible yeah probably like like I (72:23 - 72:29)
looked at the design I was like oh you (72:27 - 72:31)
know I like primate if I was a kid like (72:29 - 72:33)
a nightly looks great great name again (72:31 - 72:35)
cannot stress right names are so good (72:33 - 72:39)
but then the Pokedex entry Just Nails it (72:35 - 72:42)
that that oh my gosh like I love analy (72:39 - 72:44)
annihilate a lot (72:42 - 72:47)
good Evolution method as well yeah (72:44 - 72:49)
I did not see what that was I guess uh (72:47 - 72:51)
is is it an evolution method where like (72:49 - 72:54)
you'd have to look it up yep uh probably (72:51 - 72:56)
I do think you would probably end up (72:54 - 72:58)
doing you might end up doing it so it's (72:56 - 73:02)
use rage 20 times first (72:58 - 73:04)
um oh so it's just like a Legends thing (73:02 - 73:07)
of like Stantler was use yeah Shield (73:04 - 73:10)
bash or whatever statlers yeah exactly (73:07 - 73:13)
you need to you need to have rage fist (73:10 - 73:16)
not say oh why would I take this move (73:13 - 73:19)
uh you need to have it and then use it (73:16 - 73:23)
20 times to level it up got it (73:19 - 73:25)
um and then we have Toad's cool and Toad (73:23 - 73:28)
screw a Toad's cruel I mean wake cool (73:25 - 73:30)
wake cool and wig crew (73:28 - 73:33)
which these looked like (73:30 - 73:35)
forms (73:33 - 73:37)
like uber (73:35 - 73:40)
um they're not uh they're ground grass (73:37 - 73:43)
with a brand new ability and I thought (73:40 - 73:45)
these were so bad until I saw them in (73:43 - 73:47)
motion and then I was like I'm back in (73:45 - 73:48)
I'm back in (73:47 - 73:51)
all right do two of you place your bat (73:48 - 73:53)
somewhere I fall on this thing I'm gonna (73:51 - 73:55)
say that you hate them (73:53 - 73:57)
but you I'm gonna say you like them I'm (73:55 - 73:59)
gonna say you hate them but when you saw (73:57 - 74:00)
the move you were like (73:59 - 74:04)
okay I'll tolerate them (74:00 - 74:04)
yeah I know I think you like them (74:05 - 74:10)
I like them I like them I like them when (74:07 - 74:12)
I saw them I liked it when I saw like (74:10 - 74:13)
well again this is one of the things (74:12 - 74:16)
where like it's so dumb I'm in (74:13 - 74:18)
and then when I saw I saw its little (74:16 - 74:20)
floppy legs walking around below a tree (74:18 - 74:24)
I'm like one thousand percent sold this (74:20 - 74:26)
thing is so dumb (74:24 - 74:29)
that I have to use it (74:26 - 74:32)
did we only get what is it just Whooper (74:29 - 74:36)
is yeah no there's there's Taurus as (74:32 - 74:39)
well oh yes you're right Tauros which is (74:36 - 74:42)
technically three so it's technically (74:39 - 74:44)
four pounds (74:42 - 74:46)
well uh so yeah there's Taurus the water (74:44 - 74:48)
Taurus which is water fighting and then (74:46 - 74:52)
the fire Tauros which is fire fighting (74:48 - 74:53)
um (74:52 - 74:55)
and I think the water and the fire are (74:53 - 74:57)
just more rare is that it they're fresh (74:55 - 74:59)
they're fashion exclusive and and more (74:57 - 75:01)
rare I think they have they can only (74:59 - 75:03)
show up in like one of the two areas you (75:01 - 75:05)
can get the Taurus (75:03 - 75:07)
um and their version exclusive yeah (75:05 - 75:08)
something like that yeah and I should (75:07 - 75:12)
know that I met a graphic about it (75:08 - 75:12)
like (75:15 - 75:19)
they the water version (75:16 - 75:22)
technique like they the water and fire (75:19 - 75:24)
ones technically have a slight (75:22 - 75:27)
difference so you can see them yes (75:24 - 75:29)
they have a little blue a little red and (75:27 - 75:31)
uh their horns are different like the (75:29 - 75:33)
fire ones horns (75:31 - 75:35)
stick out straight forward like a long (75:33 - 75:38)
horn and the water ones horns twist like (75:35 - 75:41)
like a swirl like a Ram's Horn more but (75:38 - 75:44)
off to the sides (75:41 - 75:44)
I think Tauros was like a knockout here (75:45 - 75:51)
for this region I mean when they (75:49 - 75:53)
announced that Spain that everyone was (75:51 - 75:57)
like Tauros is getting its dues (75:53 - 75:58)
um yeah and I think I think it did great (75:57 - 76:01)
I I maybe would have liked to see you (75:58 - 76:03)
know if you're doing Tauros maybe touch (76:01 - 76:06)
on miltank too you've already finally (76:03 - 76:08)
you've stopped making them all male (76:06 - 76:11)
you've already (76:08 - 76:14)
touched every single Gen 2 Pokemon (76:11 - 76:17)
except Bill tank right like Dunsparce (76:14 - 76:20)
giraffe rig murkrow's been like well (76:17 - 76:23)
Skarmory Discovery have one oh Skarmory (76:20 - 76:25)
yeah (76:23 - 76:25)
yeah corvo Knight really just (76:25 - 76:30)
threw strawberry to the ground there (76:28 - 76:32)
yeah (76:30 - 76:35)
and then yeah I'll take at this point in (76:32 - 76:37)
Gen 2 that hasn't been touched (76:35 - 76:39)
yeah I mean in like the single like solo (76:37 - 76:42)
like Evolution I think so (76:39 - 76:44)
look I don't like Gen 2 I don't know (76:42 - 76:47)
speaking of Gen 2 Whooper evolves into (76:44 - 76:50)
Quagsire uh and then (76:47 - 76:53)
Whooper evolves into Claude sire (76:50 - 76:56)
a perfect Pokemon just amazing like it (76:53 - 76:58)
couldn't be any better clothes (76:56 - 77:00)
incredible he's great he's a good boy (76:58 - 77:02)
he's fine (77:00 - 77:05)
he has how can you say that toadstool is (77:02 - 77:08)
so dumb it's good clown sire is the (77:05 - 77:11)
essence of that look at this nice clad's (77:08 - 77:12)
hair is not dumb enough (77:11 - 77:16)
[Laughter] (77:12 - 77:20)
I've seen it motion I'm like (77:16 - 77:21)
what I love about it is it's it's (77:20 - 77:23)
basically just Quagsire but like black (77:21 - 77:26)
and brown and vertical yeah yeah that's (77:23 - 77:29)
exactly this it's just I I just love (77:26 - 77:31)
everything everything about that Pokemon (77:29 - 77:34)
Cloud sire is very much the there's like (77:31 - 77:36)
I feel like there's always a Pokemon in (77:34 - 77:39)
a generation that you get early enough (77:36 - 77:44)
that just ends up being a a a staple of (77:39 - 77:46)
your team because of its its typing or (77:44 - 77:48)
because of its ability or because of its (77:46 - 77:50)
moveset and clothsire (77:48 - 77:53)
hits that for a lot of people like I (77:50 - 77:55)
wouldn't have won this be if it wasn't (77:53 - 77:59)
for my cloud sire or I wrecked this this (77:55 - 78:01)
area of the game because of quad sire (77:59 - 78:03)
like I don't think a lot of Pokemon in (78:01 - 78:05)
this generation fill (78:03 - 78:08)
the void that quad sire does and I think (78:05 - 78:10)
we could probably spend a whole episode (78:08 - 78:13)
being like these are key Pokemon in the (78:10 - 78:14)
generation because it felt like everyone (78:13 - 78:16)
had those Pokemon because they were (78:14 - 78:18)
genuinely good yeah (78:16 - 78:20)
um and I'm not saying like cloth sire is (78:18 - 78:22)
like absolutely amazing in stats or (78:20 - 78:24)
anything it's just that it's typing and (78:22 - 78:26)
its ability assuming you got the good (78:24 - 78:28)
ability which is water absorb (78:26 - 78:32)
um uh I it's closer is like a contender (78:28 - 78:36)
of just like usability on a team if it's (78:32 - 78:39)
a really good uh void (78:36 - 78:40)
um and I think that's all of them (78:39 - 78:43)
besides that age Agent Zero or areas (78:40 - 78:44)
zero (78:43 - 78:48)
too much Animal Crossing (78:44 - 78:48)
um (78:49 - 78:51)
is there any anything we didn't we (78:50 - 78:53)
didn't talk I mean I guess we didn't (78:51 - 78:54)
talk about Cycles are but presumably (78:53 - 78:56)
we'd already done that in previous yeah (78:54 - 78:57)
Cycles are yeah (78:56 - 79:00)
that's fine I was I was skipping the (78:57 - 79:02)
ones that we kind of touched on Cycles (79:00 - 79:04)
are doesn't get well I guess we can (79:02 - 79:06)
Cycles are doesn't get an evolution it (79:04 - 79:10)
it is just what it is and there was lots (79:06 - 79:12)
of debate of like this is the obvious (79:10 - 79:14)
like must evolve and I was like really (79:12 - 79:15)
you think (79:14 - 79:18)
it doesn't involve it it's just there (79:15 - 79:20)
it's just there we can't go further than (79:18 - 79:21)
that without talking story but yeah yeah (79:20 - 79:23)
I yeah I think there's speculation of (79:21 - 79:26)
like theme uh with Pokemon I mean like (79:23 - 79:28)
they're the Pokedex just straight up (79:26 - 79:31)
confirms carbank and diance being (79:28 - 79:32)
related (79:31 - 79:33)
um even though they don't evolve into (79:32 - 79:35)
each other I think that was the example (79:33 - 79:38)
I used too right like yeah (79:35 - 79:38)
um (79:38 - 79:40)
but that that they're they're (79:38 - 79:43)
speculation for and I'm sure there's DLC (79:40 - 79:44)
that might expand on it who knows yeah (79:43 - 79:49)
who knows uh but yeah I uh (79:44 - 79:51)
a lot of dogs a lot of birds (79:49 - 79:53)
a lot of them (79:51 - 79:56)
fish a lot of single fish (79:53 - 79:58)
one cat (79:56 - 80:00)
greatest Godzilla that has ever existed (79:58 - 80:02)
ends up standing on two legs (80:00 - 80:06)
I cannot think that this is the (80:02 - 80:08)
strongest Pokedex (80:06 - 80:09)
um (80:08 - 80:14)
I I do really like Galler's Pokedex I do (80:09 - 80:17)
um uh Gen 5 has an obvious Advantage (80:14 - 80:19)
just because the amount of Pokemon there (80:17 - 80:21)
are duds in Gen 5 (80:19 - 80:21)
um (80:21 - 80:25)
Gen 6 and 7 I think were good pokedexes (80:21 - 80:28)
but incredibly small (80:25 - 80:30)
um a Gen 4 (80:28 - 80:33)
really a really heavily evolved on gen 1 (80:30 - 80:37)
uh in past Pokemon uh (80:33 - 80:40)
gen 3 great refresh there I think I (80:37 - 80:41)
think a lot of people would look at gen (80:40 - 80:44)
3 as a lot of great Pokemon (80:41 - 80:47)
um so it's hard to say like I there are (80:44 - 80:49)
I think for me and this is what I've (80:47 - 80:50)
said you know (80:49 - 80:52)
throughout the weekend of playing on on (80:50 - 80:54)
Twitch and I will still continue to be (80:52 - 80:56)
playing on Twitch if if you want (80:54 - 80:58)
somebody to watch and you know once you (80:56 - 80:59)
finish I know people are like not (80:58 - 81:00)
watching because they're trying to get (80:59 - 81:02)
the story totally understand right you (81:00 - 81:04)
want to experience that story yourself (81:02 - 81:05)
um (81:04 - 81:07)
but for me there wasn't a lot of like (81:05 - 81:10)
this Pokemon is instantly moving into my (81:07 - 81:13)
top 10 where other Generations have done (81:10 - 81:15)
that like oh Gen 6 came along boom we're (81:13 - 81:17)
putting this in the top ten oh gen seven (81:15 - 81:19)
putting this in the top ten obviously (81:17 - 81:21)
cramerant for me really solidified like (81:19 - 81:22)
an all-time favorite and there's a lot (81:21 - 81:24)
of other Galler Pokemon that like I (81:22 - 81:26)
would easily say like this is top 10 (81:24 - 81:27)
might well I mean my top 10 probably (81:26 - 81:30)
constantly rotating but (81:27 - 81:33)
um I like so many of these Pokemon (81:30 - 81:36)
and even tandemouse and mouse hold which (81:33 - 81:38)
I I think for me are the ones that are I (81:36 - 81:41)
really really do like they would barely (81:38 - 81:43)
make my top 10 I feel like like I think (81:41 - 81:45)
they're good (81:43 - 81:47)
um but maybe I just need more time in (81:45 - 81:50)
the region so that's my final thoughts (81:47 - 81:53)
I think tinkerton is in my top ten I (81:50 - 81:54)
think (81:53 - 81:56)
uh (81:54 - 81:59)
uh my ice Godzilla is probably in my top (81:56 - 82:00)
ten (81:59 - 82:02)
um but that's it like I'm not in love (82:00 - 82:05)
with a lot of the other ones in this (82:02 - 82:07)
region enough to be like I want to make (82:05 - 82:09)
sure these carry forward (82:07 - 82:12)
um but I think Bex caliber and tinkerton (82:09 - 82:13)
are (82:12 - 82:17)
great additions to (82:13 - 82:20)
Pokemon (82:17 - 82:20)
Al what are you what are you thinking (82:20 - 82:23)
here (82:21 - 82:25)
so I haven't (82:23 - 82:27)
sat down and done the list right (82:25 - 82:29)
recently because it it's going to take (82:27 - 82:31)
me some time I think but I suspect there (82:29 - 82:33)
are a few from here that will get into (82:31 - 82:35)
my top ten (82:33 - 82:37)
um but yeah I'm not (82:35 - 82:39)
it's a difficult one right because for (82:37 - 82:40)
every Pokemon you put in you have to (82:39 - 82:43)
take one out right and it has to be that (82:40 - 82:44)
good right it has to be good to start (82:43 - 82:46)
bumping exactly (82:44 - 82:47)
um yeah so it's going to take some more (82:46 - 82:49)
time with them to make sure they're (82:47 - 82:50)
worthy of that I'm not going to do it (82:49 - 82:52)
after less than a week thank you very (82:50 - 82:54)
much but there are definitely contenders (82:52 - 82:57)
for it yeah (82:54 - 82:57)
yeah (82:57 - 83:02)
um but I I it has been so cool you know (82:59 - 83:03)
playing with other people this this past (83:02 - 83:05)
weekend and watch people gravitate (83:03 - 83:07)
towards certain Pokemon like I have seen (83:05 - 83:12)
people gravitate towards uh Garden Ackle (83:07 - 83:15)
um the salt giant thing yeah that's all (83:12 - 83:18)
giant Knuckles you know I I've seen a (83:15 - 83:19)
ton of people gravitate towards (83:18 - 83:20)
tinkerton (83:19 - 83:25)
um and Char Cadet and uh (83:20 - 83:25)
Bombardier uh I I know there was (83:25 - 83:30)
somebody very excited about Bombardier (83:28 - 83:33)
uh tasaguri was was a big hit that I saw (83:30 - 83:35)
so you know you see people gravitate (83:33 - 83:37)
through certain Pokemon and it's really (83:35 - 83:38)
cool it's really cool to see why people (83:37 - 83:40)
like certain Pokemon so there's a lot (83:38 - 83:41)
here (83:40 - 83:43)
um it is also funny uh seeing people (83:41 - 83:45)
very upset that the dolphin evolves and (83:43 - 83:47)
then not understanding that like right (83:45 - 83:48)
there's like there's a gimmick there (83:47 - 83:50)
right like yeah like it's hiding its (83:48 - 83:53)
secret identity until it comes back out (83:50 - 83:56)
um which is it's super clever (83:53 - 83:57)
um (83:56 - 84:00)
so I will say I think (83:57 - 84:02)
I think this generation has certainly (84:00 - 84:04)
thrown it out the park with hit it out (84:02 - 84:07)
the park not thrown out of the park (84:04 - 84:11)
Steve is infecting your brain yeah (84:07 - 84:13)
I think (84:11 - 84:17)
um the you know you can take on me take (84:13 - 84:19)
or leave a bunch of these Pokemon but I (84:17 - 84:21)
think most of the Chinese are very good (84:19 - 84:23)
right unless they're purposely bad like (84:21 - 84:27)
tandemous and Taurus can we just take a (84:23 - 84:29)
accessibility moment to say (84:27 - 84:31)
my PSA to (84:29 - 84:33)
Game Freak (84:31 - 84:35)
all of you (84:33 - 84:38)
Legends of Arceus you had a sound in the (84:35 - 84:40)
Overworld which helps a million people (84:38 - 84:43)
who have visual impairments and before (84:40 - 84:45)
you come into the comments to say people (84:43 - 84:47)
who can't see shouldn't play games I (84:45 - 84:49)
have a visual impairment if you had (84:47 - 84:50)
noticed I'm wearing glasses I would hope (84:49 - 84:52)
no one comes into the comments for that (84:50 - 84:55)
I mean oh believe me they they will for (84:52 - 84:57)
for for probably the last six or seven (84:55 - 85:00)
years on the show I'm like well I I (84:57 - 85:01)
would say actually since Pokemon go (85:00 - 85:05)
where they put a little Sparkle in the (85:01 - 85:07)
name of the Pokemon which was fantastic (85:05 - 85:09)
fantastic (85:07 - 85:11)
um even because I I have a friend who is (85:09 - 85:13)
colorblind and they have texted me I (85:11 - 85:14)
have a lot of friends who are colorblind (85:13 - 85:16)
and they they're like hey I just found (85:14 - 85:18)
this shiny in X and Y and they send me a (85:16 - 85:20)
picture of it and they're like can you (85:18 - 85:21)
just confirm that this is shiny or not I (85:20 - 85:25)
can't really tell and that that could be (85:21 - 85:27)
completely solved by having a little (85:25 - 85:30)
symbol in the name of the Pokemon it's (85:27 - 85:33)
almost like they did this the Legends (85:30 - 85:36)
Arceus they did it (85:33 - 85:36)
Arceus they even put it into the box in (85:37 - 85:42)
Legends Arc yes and they changed it like (85:41 - 85:46)
they did it oh I yeah it's it's the most (85:42 - 85:47)
frustrating thing to get your first (85:46 - 85:49)
shiny Pokemon in this game and then you (85:47 - 85:50)
look in your party and it doesn't look (85:49 - 85:53)
like it's shiny I just do not understand (85:50 - 85:57)
why they're Sprites right they're the (85:53 - 85:58)
easiest thing that you have the shiny (85:57 - 86:00)
Sprites we know you have the shiny (85:58 - 86:02)
Sprites they're in home Pokemon home (86:00 - 86:05)
doesn't have them (86:02 - 86:05)
okay you you can sit here and you can (86:05 - 86:11)
say the logistical reason why it doesn't (86:09 - 86:13)
Sparkle or doesn't make a sound is to (86:11 - 86:15)
make you pay attention or to make (86:13 - 86:17)
Chinese harder right I'm not defending (86:15 - 86:19)
that but that is probably the logistical (86:17 - 86:22)
reason of like you know you have a (86:19 - 86:24)
person flying you know all three of us (86:22 - 86:25)
have probably done this you start (86:24 - 86:27)
Legends you you get to the camp you go (86:25 - 86:29)
up into the sky and you just do a full (86:27 - 86:31)
circle and you go no shinies and a lot (86:29 - 86:32)
of the times if you have the shiny charm (86:31 - 86:34)
and you did that you would find one or (86:32 - 86:36)
two you would find them very quickly and (86:34 - 86:38)
there's we can have a whole episode (86:36 - 86:40)
about the whole debate of whether they (86:38 - 86:42)
should be more rare or less rare or (86:40 - 86:43)
whatever the end of the story is they (86:42 - 86:45)
want them to be rare your level of (86:43 - 86:47)
Rarity may vary to what game freak (86:45 - 86:50)
thinks but there's still a huge (86:47 - 86:53)
accessibility issue (86:50 - 86:57)
Pokemon games but Nintendo games in (86:53 - 86:59)
general there is no colorblind mode (86:57 - 87:02)
there is there and and if if you cannot (86:59 - 87:04)
program a colorblind mode which is still (87:02 - 87:06)
baffling to me just like that that is (87:04 - 87:09)
worth the development time for any video (87:06 - 87:11)
game right even Pokemon unite has a (87:09 - 87:14)
colorblind mode and I turn it on and I I (87:11 - 87:16)
wouldn't consider myself colorblind but (87:14 - 87:18)
like I have turned colorblind mode on in (87:16 - 87:19)
Destiny (87:18 - 87:22)
um in in Apex legends in Pokemon unite (87:19 - 87:24)
probably other games I no longer play (87:22 - 87:28)
because I love that Stark color (87:24 - 87:30)
difference right like it contrast makes (87:28 - 87:33)
it easier for you to see right maybe it (87:30 - 87:35)
is because I'm getting older right it as (87:33 - 87:37)
you get older it gets worse but like I (87:35 - 87:39)
had a friend I went and played in and (87:37 - 87:42)
like oh you have a shiny small love I I (87:39 - 87:45)
well Arbor Olive and I'm like no (87:42 - 87:47)
you just can't see the subtle color it's (87:45 - 87:49)
purple not black (87:47 - 87:51)
because they they knew that the change (87:49 - 87:52)
was black but of course they're (87:51 - 87:53)
colorblind let's registered the dark (87:52 - 87:56)
purple is black so I'm like no and (87:53 - 87:58)
naturally you wouldn't do that because (87:56 - 88:01)
you can't tell and they got rid of the (87:58 - 88:03)
sound they get rid of the mark they just (88:01 - 88:05)
decided accessibility should go out the (88:03 - 88:07)
window and it stinks (88:05 - 88:09)
so many of these Chinese even the good (88:07 - 88:12)
ones are hard to tell hard to tell this (88:09 - 88:13)
is the thing and they may be good and (88:12 - 88:15)
like if you take our believer as an (88:13 - 88:17)
example I think it's a great shiny it is (88:15 - 88:18)
um (88:17 - 88:21)
but I like I can't see images in my head (88:18 - 88:23)
so I have really trouble remembering (88:21 - 88:25)
what colors what things wear I mean it's (88:23 - 88:27)
definitely the obvious ones that I get (88:25 - 88:29)
it's not just visual impairment it's (88:27 - 88:31)
people who like you'd have to you'd have (88:29 - 88:33)
to compare things there's a ton of (88:31 - 88:35)
people who can't hold the image in their (88:33 - 88:37)
head to know what the difference is and (88:35 - 88:41)
without a symbol without a sound without (88:37 - 88:44)
something else accessibility just tanks (88:41 - 88:47)
and it's super frustrating also (88:44 - 88:49)
accessibility thing Pokemon don't close (88:47 - 88:51)
their eyes when they're asleep anymore (88:49 - 88:53)
why they close their eyes in Camp it is (88:51 - 88:57)
it is why I I watched all six of my (88:53 - 88:59)
Pokemon fall asleep in Camp and watch (88:57 - 89:00)
their eyes visit well except for (88:59 - 89:01)
gastronard because he doesn't have (89:00 - 89:03)
eyelids but (89:01 - 89:07)
um their eyes close yeah and so like you (89:03 - 89:08)
know we've we have problems with the (89:07 - 89:11)
game I'm very glad we were able to do uh (89:08 - 89:13)
and and I know people are exhausted (89:11 - 89:15)
about hearing the problems because at (89:13 - 89:17)
the end of the day the game is genuinely (89:15 - 89:19)
fun it is generally fun and the gameplay (89:17 - 89:22)
Loop they did is great and the there's (89:19 - 89:24)
so many good things and then there's (89:22 - 89:26)
everything bad and you know I mean (89:24 - 89:29)
people I'm enjoying it and even I'm (89:26 - 89:31)
exhausted of of hearing the bad things (89:29 - 89:34)
but they do exist they exist uh and it (89:31 - 89:36)
it screams to me that this game was like (89:34 - 89:38)
you know every game is rushed I used to (89:36 - 89:40)
work on websites every website I ever (89:38 - 89:42)
worked on was rushed because people want (89:40 - 89:44)
a website out at a certain time and you (89:42 - 89:47)
have to make Cuts you're like you want (89:44 - 89:50)
this feature we can have it but not at (89:47 - 89:53)
launch you want this well do you want a (89:50 - 89:54)
or b because I can only do one before (89:53 - 89:57)
the date you want so they took three (89:54 - 89:59)
years on this game (89:57 - 90:00)
I don't think anyone's doubting that (89:59 - 90:02)
it's very ambitious for what game freak (90:00 - 90:04)
has done but like when you see things (90:02 - 90:05)
like (90:04 - 90:08)
the eyes don't close right they used to (90:05 - 90:11)
close and they close in the camp Camp so (90:08 - 90:14)
we know you it's programmed in it's like (90:11 - 90:17)
what else did they have to cut to get (90:14 - 90:20)
this game to be delivered I (90:17 - 90:24)
I just the the symbol next to the name (90:20 - 90:27)
would would probably alleviate a lot of (90:24 - 90:29)
the complaints not all because I know (90:27 - 90:30)
people miss the sound people miss the (90:29 - 90:33)
Sparkles but like that there's still a (90:30 - 90:36)
huge accessibility issue there (90:33 - 90:38)
um for a lot of people and I will I will (90:36 - 90:39)
sit on the show for the next two three (90:38 - 90:41)
four or five years (90:39 - 90:43)
we need colorblind modes in every video (90:41 - 90:46)
game and again that's not a Pokemon (90:43 - 90:48)
problem I can't think of (90:46 - 90:51)
a Mario game or Zelda game or Bayonetta (90:48 - 90:52)
or xenoblite I don't think any of them (90:51 - 90:54)
have colorblind modes and they should (90:52 - 90:56)
they should (90:54 - 90:58)
it's frustrating all right we've gone (90:56 - 91:00)
way too long we're gonna wait too long (90:58 - 91:03)
uh and I I so (91:00 - 91:04)
um (91:03 - 91:06)
yeah thank you for listening uh we used (91:04 - 91:07)
