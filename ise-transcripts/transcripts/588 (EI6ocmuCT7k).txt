Circle at Mall of America I have nothing (1:05 - 1:11)
to say Greg is also here I am also here (1:08 - 1:15)
I am fresh off my first week of work (1:11 - 1:20)
and you know it's tiring work I forgot (1:15 - 1:22)
that aspect of it where I was like at (1:20 - 1:24)
the end of the day I'm more tired than (1:22 - 1:26)
me just sitting on my couch being (1:24 - 1:28)
depressed huh who (1:26 - 1:31)
knew um (1:28 - 1:33)
[Laughter] (1:31 - 1:36)
uh so today's show is primar I don't (1:33 - 1:38)
know about primarily but we're we we (1:36 - 1:40)
have a huge section to talk about (1:38 - 1:42)
detective Pikachu that'll be after the (1:40 - 1:47)
Break um this game has been out for two (1:42 - 1:50)
weeks two weeks (1:47 - 1:52)
so uh there will be some spoilers we're (1:50 - 1:54)
not going to spoiler the ending but I (1:52 - 1:56)
I'm I I don't know the ending but I'm (1:54 - 1:59)
going to safely say if you saw the movie (1:56 - 2:02)
it's probably a similar ending uh you (1:59 - 2:03)
probably knew when you beat the first (2:02 - 2:05)
game what the ending should have been (2:03 - 2:08)
and then you had to wait like 5 years so (2:05 - 2:09)
uh we're not going to talk about the (2:08 - 2:10)
ending because uh only Greg Beat It (2:09 - 2:13)
Hannah and I are in the same chapter uh (2:10 - 2:15)
but that's not the point I think the (2:13 - 2:18)
point is just to talk about should you (2:15 - 2:20)
buy this game so we'll talk about that (2:18 - 2:23)
second half of the break like always (2:20 - 2:27)
like clock work Pokemon (2:23 - 2:29)
sleep there's (2:27 - 2:32)
a no no one saw this one coming uh (2:29 - 2:33)
before our daily check-in we actually (2:32 - 2:35)
have (2:33 - 2:39)
news which is yeah we do beginning at (2:35 - 2:42)
400 a.m. it just say 4 is this (2:39 - 2:46)
everyone's 400 a.m. uh 400 a.m. Imaging (2:42 - 2:48)
it's everybody's 4 a your own personal 4 (2:46 - 2:52)
a.m. there's no time zones listed uh (2:48 - 2:53)
beginning on 4:00 A.M on Monday October (2:52 - 2:57)
30th we will be holding a Halloween 2023 (2:53 - 2:59)
double candy research trick-or treat (2:57 - 3:00)
event (2:59 - 3:02)
uh during the long the weekl long (3:00 - 3:04)
Halloween uh double candy research event (3:02 - 3:06)
you'll be able to encounter different (3:04 - 3:09)
typ sleep types regardless of your own (3:06 - 3:12)
sleep type you also get lavish rewards (3:09 - 3:15)
their words not mine uh such as a total (3:12 - 3:18)
of 25 (3:15 - 3:21)
cand but you have to do a special (3:18 - 3:23)
mission for (3:21 - 3:26)
that and you will get uh at least twice (3:23 - 3:29)
the usual number of Pokemon candies from (3:26 - 3:30)
sleep res (3:29 - 3:34)
search uh also you can find a Pikachu (3:30 - 3:37)
wearing a Halloween hat and Ghost type (3:34 - 3:39)
Pokémon such as (3:37 - 3:43)
Gastly so uh hat Pokemon are coming to (3:39 - 3:46)
Pokemon sleep and they can't evolve or (3:43 - 3:48)
at least this Pikachu can't evolve which (3:46 - 3:50)
kind of doesn't help with the way sleep (3:48 - 3:52)
Works you're not going to ever want to (3:50 - 3:55)
use this Pikachu unless they've done (3:52 - 3:58)
something other to it then just could (3:55 - 4:01)
have like a better ability skill what is (3:58 - 4:04)
it called main skill I think yeah main (4:01 - 4:06)
skill (4:04 - 4:09)
yeah I mean this is why you have your (4:06 - 4:12)
your box upgrades this is why you need (4:09 - 4:15)
to pay the gems to get more Pokemon (4:12 - 4:17)
storage because you're going to be (4:15 - 4:19)
filling it up with all of the hats just (4:17 - 4:21)
like in Pokémon go and they just like (4:19 - 4:25)
Pokemon go they can go nowhere forever (4:21 - 4:27)
trapped inside (4:25 - 4:30)
sleep this is the argument I made like a (4:27 - 4:32)
month ago (4:30 - 4:37)
of in like Pokemon go you just have like (4:32 - 4:39)
an Abra and that Abra could be a (4:37 - 4:41)
different CP and it could have different (4:39 - 4:43)
IVs but at the end of the day it's just (4:41 - 4:44)
an (4:43 - 4:47)
Abra and if you were to do if you were (4:44 - 4:49)
to evolve it to Alakazam and take it (4:47 - 4:52)
into raids there's really not I don't (4:49 - 4:53)
want to have this conversation again (4:52 - 4:55)
there's not actually like that much of a (4:53 - 4:59)
difference between like a a 0% Alakazam (4:55 - 5:02)
and like a 15 155 Alakazam when you are (4:59 - 5:06)
raiding uh now of course in PvP there's (5:02 - 5:09)
a difference but with like Pokemon sleep (5:06 - 5:12)
I have like five psyducks and they have (5:09 - 5:15)
like different gold sub skills and they (5:12 - 5:18)
have different abilities which is like (5:15 - 5:22)
item finder or up or experience down and (5:18 - 5:24)
I haven't sat there with a calculator to (5:22 - 5:26)
be like which one of these should I (5:24 - 5:28)
throw out because they're so different (5:26 - 5:30)
compared to like Pokemon do it with just (5:28 - 5:33)
a calculator because you have to figure (5:30 - 5:35)
out which one corresponds with its main (5:33 - 5:38)
ability and it's it's more complicated (5:35 - 5:41)
than just this specific sub ability is (5:38 - 5:42)
this (5:41 - 5:45)
valuable I know there are calculators (5:42 - 5:48)
but but it it's not good (5:45 - 5:48)
enough I don't want I only need like one (5:50 - 5:54)
or two of these (5:53 - 5:57)
signu they all can't possibly be good (5:54 - 5:59)
there must be like I just don't know how (5:57 - 6:01)
to figure it out without sitting in (5:59 - 6:03)
front of a spreadsheet being like which (6:01 - 6:04)
is the (6:03 - 6:08)
best yeah I mean you need to compare (6:04 - 6:10)
them you need to directly compare them (6:08 - 6:11)
and you need to see which one has the (6:10 - 6:13)
better subskills that benefit its main (6:11 - 6:15)
skill is at least the way I've been (6:13 - 6:17)
doing it I thought the one calculator I (6:15 - 6:21)
sent you does take in a in the one (6:17 - 6:23)
calculator you sent me kind of values (6:21 - 6:26)
all the subskills the same regardless of (6:23 - 6:28)
which kind of Pokemon it is so I was (6:26 - 6:31)
told that in order to use that (6:28 - 6:34)
calculator properly just max out each (6:31 - 6:35)
subskill (6:34 - 6:39)
because that would give you a (6:35 - 6:41)
better for those that don't play sleep (6:39 - 6:44)
your Pokemon has five sub skills which (6:41 - 6:46)
is level 10 level (6:44 - 6:51)
25 50 75 100 and those skills you can (6:46 - 6:56)
upgrade as well as your main skill so (6:51 - 7:00)
ideally you should upgrade you so I had (6:56 - 7:02)
I used my master ball I used it on an (7:00 - 7:06)
absu lucky uh I was because people were (7:02 - 7:08)
saying absu and Kangas Canan are like (7:06 - 7:12)
really good to AB and Heracross I think (7:08 - 7:14)
is the other one mhm so I was like (7:12 - 7:16)
whatever I'll just masterball the abso I (7:14 - 7:17)
have enough points to get another master (7:16 - 7:19)
ball if I need it which is another which (7:17 - 7:20)
is kind of a good thing about the game (7:19 - 7:22)
is you don't have to hold a master ball (7:20 - 7:24)
the entire time you just buy it whenever (7:22 - 7:27)
you need it which is like cool so I (7:24 - 7:30)
plugged absil into the calculator so I (7:27 - 7:32)
regret my master ball throwing and it (7:30 - 7:35)
said it was a c tier Pokemon I was like (7:32 - 7:38)
okay well it's not F that's cool and (7:35 - 7:40)
then I upgraded the skills from like I (7:38 - 7:42)
don't know like item finder small to (7:40 - 7:45)
item finder medium so like if I was to (7:42 - 7:48)
upgrade the skills with the seeds I have (7:45 - 7:50)
and then it became an S tier (7:48 - 7:53)
Pokemon yeah but first of all you have (7:50 - 7:56)
to actually spend money to get those (7:53 - 7:58)
seeds no you can get them in the oh I'm (7:56 - 8:00)
in the premium store so in so you have (7:58 - 8:03)
to be spending (8:00 - 8:06)
money and second of all I still think (8:03 - 8:08)
that that calculator doesn't work well (8:06 - 8:09)
because you're going to be just (8:08 - 8:10)
upgrading those sub skills and it's (8:09 - 8:13)
going to be calculating based off of how (8:10 - 8:14)
good the subskills are regardless of (8:13 - 8:18)
what the main skill is so if you have a (8:14 - 8:20)
berry finder and what you want it to do (8:18 - 8:23)
is primarily gather as many berries as (8:20 - 8:26)
it possibly can you want subskills that (8:23 - 8:29)
benefit that yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah (8:26 - 8:30)
and that calculator doesn't take that (8:29 - 8:31)
into (8:30 - 8:35)
account it's complicated I know but like (8:31 - 8:37)
what else am I supposed to you're (8:35 - 8:40)
supposed to look at it and think about (8:37 - 8:43)
it I can't I'm too dumb to figure it out (8:40 - 8:45)
it's too complicated of a (8:43 - 8:48)
[Laughter] (8:45 - 8:51)
game it is more complicated than Pokemon (8:48 - 8:54)
go as a Pokemon go person I will say (8:51 - 8:56)
there are Legacy moves that make some (8:54 - 8:57)
Pokémon significantly different from (8:56 - 9:01)
others but aside aside from that mostly (8:57 - 9:04)
one Pokemon is roughly the same as (9:01 - 9:06)
another this is why I haven't like (9:04 - 9:07)
recommended the calculator though to (9:06 - 9:09)
people CU people will like write it and (9:07 - 9:11)
they'll be like give me that calculator (9:09 - 9:13)
you could find it pretty easily if you (9:11 - 9:15)
did a couple Google searches (9:13 - 9:19)
but it it doesn't yeah but it but what (9:15 - 9:22)
else is there to base things on like the (9:19 - 9:24)
calculator at Le you look at it and you (9:22 - 9:27)
think about it you think about your (9:24 - 9:32)
choices um so day one of this event is (9:27 - 9:34)
going to be October (9:32 - 9:38)
30th uh day two is actually (9:34 - 9:41)
Halloween (9:38 - 9:44)
uh and then they're they're saying like (9:41 - 9:46)
day three day four day five so the only (9:44 - 9:47)
two days that matter is the second day (9:46 - 9:48)
which is (9:47 - 9:50)
Halloween will not matter because you're (9:48 - 9:52)
getting candy and then the last day (9:50 - 9:55)
there's going to be bonuses on Halloween (9:52 - 9:58)
itself and then the last day of the (9:55 - 10:01)
event which is Sunday November 5th so (9:58 - 10:04)
researchers will gain three times the (10:01 - 10:07)
usual amount of candy um many different (10:04 - 10:10)
Pokemon will appear regardless of your (10:07 - 10:11)
sleep (10:10 - 10:13)
research uh and certain Pokemon will (10:11 - 10:15)
have a greater chance of appearing I'm (10:13 - 10:17)
assuming that's like Gasol and Pikachu (10:15 - 10:19)
because they literally said that well (10:17 - 10:20)
it's Gasol and Pikachu and there are (10:19 - 10:22)
question marks question mark Mark (10:20 - 10:24)
there're going to be two new Pokemon (10:22 - 10:26)
your rival from Pokemon Silver is going (10:24 - 10:28)
to show oh heck (10:26 - 10:32)
yeah uh other days you will gain two (10:28 - 10:34)
times the amount of candy and a few (10:32 - 10:36)
different Pokemon will appear regardless (10:34 - 10:38)
of your (10:36 - 10:39)
sleep and (10:38 - 10:42)
then you will have a great much greater (10:39 - 10:44)
chance to encounter Pikachu in the (10:42 - 10:47)
Halloween costume Gastly Haunter Gengar (10:44 - 10:51)
a great chance to en counter Meowth and (10:47 - 10:53)
Cubone and then a slightly greater (10:51 - 10:55)
Encounter of the question mark question (10:53 - 10:57)
mark question (10:55 - 10:58)
mark (10:57 - 11:02)
um they're saying that the event bonuses (10:58 - 11:05)
will only be tracked on green grass (11:02 - 11:09)
aisle so if you're listening to this now (11:05 - 11:12)
on Monday maybe uh just spend more time (11:09 - 11:16)
on green grass aisle to up your research (11:12 - 11:18)
and make sure that next Monday you (11:16 - 11:21)
choose green grass because otherwise uh (11:18 - 11:23)
you're going to miss the event miss the (11:21 - 11:25)
event if you there is the island hopping (11:23 - 11:28)
ticket so if you accidentally choose the (11:25 - 11:30)
wrong Island (11:28 - 11:31)
I think you should be able to switch to (11:30 - 11:33)
green grass but you don't want to have (11:31 - 11:37)
to do that yeah I'm curious if in the (11:33 - 11:39)
game they going to be like event (11:37 - 11:43)
happening here on this island I hope so (11:39 - 11:45)
if you're not reading the press releases (11:43 - 11:48)
or the in-game news or the Twitter or (11:45 - 11:50)
listening to a podcast and you just pick (11:48 - 11:51)
the (11:50 - 11:54)
beach that would (11:51 - 11:56)
suck (11:54 - 12:01)
yeah uh this is also going to over lap (11:56 - 12:05)
with um good sleep (12:01 - 12:08)
day they're back to back yeah they're (12:05 - 12:10)
back to back but I think one of the days (12:08 - 12:14)
overlaps cuz good sleep day uh (12:10 - 12:17)
yep so it's the 30th is the last day of (12:14 - 12:21)
good sleep day yes I think so so good (12:17 - 12:24)
sleep day would be starting the 28th the (12:21 - 12:27)
full moon technically the 29th and then (12:24 - 12:30)
the last would be the 30th so there's (12:27 - 12:34)
like a slight overlap so oh I have a (12:30 - 12:36)
question maybe Hannah knows this can you (12:34 - 12:39)
use your good camp ticket in the middle (12:36 - 12:42)
of the week so you can so I accidentally (12:39 - 12:44)
used one once so would it go Thursday to (12:42 - 12:49)
Thursday yep huh I might save my good (12:44 - 12:51)
camp because like if I used it tomorrow (12:49 - 12:55)
on Monday then it would end on Monday (12:51 - 12:56)
and then I would be (12:55 - 12:58)
missing it would end right before (12:56 - 13:01)
Halloween so I'd have to use another one (12:58 - 13:04)
yeah using the camp ticket right before (13:01 - 13:06)
this month's good sleep day starts (13:04 - 13:10)
sounds like a really good idea yeah yeah (13:06 - 13:12)
that does okay cool that's what I'm (13:10 - 13:13)
going to do I'm going to probably pop it (13:12 - 13:16)
on Thursday Thursday night or Friday (13:13 - 13:18)
Thursday or Friday night something like (13:16 - 13:21)
that when I (13:18 - 13:21)
remember (13:23 - 13:27)
um yeah Pokemon sleep so good I guess my (13:25 - 13:30)
check-in was I used my master ball (13:27 - 13:32)
so my check-in is that I learned that (13:30 - 13:34)
there is or I started using the fast (13:32 - 13:37)
forward button in the mornings so I'm (13:34 - 13:39)
not taking individual photos of every (13:37 - 13:41)
Pokemon I've already taken photos of and (13:39 - 13:43)
it just goes by faster and it's nice it (13:41 - 13:45)
does it makes a nice little shudder (13:43 - 13:49)
noise it (13:45 - 13:49)
does Greg you're still pressing the (13:49 - 13:53)
button I hit the (13:51 - 13:57)
button button button every week every (13:53 - 14:00)
week is an S week so like I I've never (13:57 - 14:02)
gotten s mine's like f every week how (14:00 - 14:06)
it's so easy just sleep I hit the button (14:02 - 14:08)
every week is an S week There's never (14:06 - 14:11)
not a s week gr I don't think I've ever (14:08 - 14:13)
got get further into work and then keep (14:11 - 14:16)
saying that I went through an entire (14:13 - 14:19)
week of work where I had to get up new (14:16 - 14:21)
schedule and I'm still getting an S (14:19 - 14:24)
sleep schedule does well when it's gives (14:21 - 14:26)
you like the S does it give you like (14:24 - 14:28)
rewards I yeah something it says hey (14:26 - 14:30)
here's stuff I don't pay that much (14:28 - 14:33)
attention I'm like cool thanks bye okay (14:30 - 14:35)
cuz what okay so my bedtime was set for (14:33 - 14:37)
for 4:00 a.m. right that's what I said (14:35 - 14:39)
it two months ago and then when I was in (14:37 - 14:42)
Korea I was going to bed at 2: a.m. (14:39 - 14:44)
every night like it was consistent but (14:42 - 14:46)
it punished me and it only gave me like (14:44 - 14:48)
a d cuz I didn't go to bed at my bedtime (14:46 - 14:50)
even though I consistently went to bed (14:48 - 14:53)
at 2:00 a.m. and I woke like I got like8 (14:50 - 14:55)
hours of sleep every night my my stay in (14:53 - 14:57)
Korea was the most consistent sleep I (14:55 - 14:59)
ever had cuz I was just so so exhausted (14:57 - 15:02)
from walking around South Korea all day (14:59 - 15:04)
that I passed out at 2: a.m. every (15:02 - 15:07)
single morning or at night and it still (15:04 - 15:09)
was like you failed you suck at this (15:07 - 15:12)
game was it consistent for a full entire (15:09 - 15:15)
week though full entire week okay I have (15:12 - 15:18)
found that if I am consistent for six (15:15 - 15:20)
out of seven days of a week and then go (15:18 - 15:23)
to sleep later one night of the week it (15:20 - 15:26)
it brings my score down at least two (15:23 - 15:30)
levels and where did it list your weeks (15:26 - 15:31)
in here somewhere to show you what your (15:30 - 15:33)

just on Twitter where people just gush (17:18 - 17:24)
about her outfit and I will say her (17:21 - 17:27)
outfit is really great every single time (17:24 - 17:29)
sometimes questionable why they pick the (17:27 - 17:32)
Pokemon they picked to stand next to her (17:29 - 17:34)

through the speaker experience playing (18:08 - 18:12)
through Pokemon games in the Game Boy (18:10 - 18:14)
many of the original 151 Pokemon are (18:12 - 18:17)
featured in this song um lyrics reflect (18:14 - 18:19)
the joyful impact that Pokemon has on (18:17 - 18:21)

life uh (18:22 - 18:27)

months and the following four producers (19:32 - 19:38)
will also participate continuing in late (19:35 - 19:40)
November see there's a lot to this this (19:38 - 19:42)
is why we haven't covered it also like (19:40 - 19:43)
yeah this is a lot bigger than I thought (19:42 - 19:46)
it was this is assuming you understand (19:43 - 19:50)
what hatsu hatsun Miku is that's the (19:46 - 19:53)
first perer of Entry which in itself (19:50 - 19:56)
could be its own pod like not like one (19:53 - 19:59)
podcast episode like an ongoing (19:56 - 20:02)
I'm sure there are podcasts in apple or (19:59 - 20:04)
Spotify that is like every week we're (20:02 - 20:07)
talking about hatsun Miku um I don't (20:04 - 20:10)
know how to sum that up in like a (20:07 - 20:14)
paragraph of like this is a I'm still (20:10 - 20:15)
not sure I fully understand and I've (20:14 - 20:19)
been trying to understand for like 15 (20:15 - 20:24)
years Greg what I mean I can do my (20:19 - 20:26)
what's to (20:24 - 20:28)
understand the concept seems pretty (20:26 - 20:32)
simple I don't where's the (20:28 - 20:37)
hangup like anyone can use hatsun (20:32 - 20:39)
muku because (20:37 - 20:42)
she's Vocaloid is like a voice Sy (20:39 - 20:45)
synthesizer so you can make songs with (20:42 - 20:47)
the voice of Miku or with any of the (20:45 - 20:49)
other Vocaloids but then Miku is a (20:47 - 20:52)
specific character who has kind of (20:49 - 20:55)
become a celebrity as a specific (20:52 - 20:57)
character she is no that's definitely a (20:55 - 21:03)
celebrity one 100% a celebrity y yep (20:57 - 21:06)
but no I this is where I stop (21:03 - 21:08)
understanding right like cuz originally (21:06 - 21:12)
she was vocal Vocaloid software y but (21:08 - 21:15)
she's she's transcended past (21:12 - 21:18)
software and (21:15 - 21:21)
anyone can use her for anything you can (21:18 - 21:23)
use her for a music video you can use (21:21 - 21:25)
her for your song you can use her as a (21:23 - 21:29)
3D model you don't like need permission (21:25 - 21:32)
to use her at all but I guess maybe the (21:29 - 21:33)
permission would be like you need to (21:32 - 21:38)
spend the $200 on her like software I (21:33 - 21:40)
don't know how much her software (21:38 - 21:43)
costs but yeah like that's that's like (21:40 - 21:45)
the weird thing about her is like you (21:43 - 21:48)
can use her for anything um but there (21:45 - 21:51)
are like official concerts and (21:48 - 21:53)
collaborations and stuff with her so (21:51 - 21:56)
that's like the part I don't understand (21:53 - 21:59)
is like anyone can use use (21:56 - 22:03)
meiku to make songs but then who does (21:59 - 22:07)
the Pokemon company reach out to to be (22:03 - 22:09)
like I guess the people who make meiku (22:07 - 22:13)
but anyone can make meu stuff so that's (22:09 - 22:15)
the like part I'm like slightly like I (22:13 - 22:17)
get it but also I don't get it like I (22:15 - 22:20)
get that that like this I (22:17 - 22:24)
understand but I don't um I so I think I (22:20 - 22:27)
think the hangup is a very American (22:24 - 22:31)
hangup in which we can't use characters (22:27 - 22:34)
without paying somebody like our (22:31 - 22:36)
licensing and capitalistic nightmare (22:34 - 22:38)
that we live in means like if I was (22:36 - 22:41)
going to take anything from Disney or (22:38 - 22:44)
anything from Marvel Comics there would (22:41 - 22:47)
be a legal team of 50 million lawyers (22:44 - 22:49)
and a million fees and Licensing (22:47 - 22:51)
agreements that have to happen I don't (22:49 - 22:54)
think that exists here and it's just a (22:51 - 22:57)
foreign concept of like well who do I (22:54 - 22:59)
pay (22:57 - 23:01)
I mean open source isn't a completely (22:59 - 23:05)
foreign concept um yeah that's a good (23:01 - 23:08)
word open yeah like you can open open (23:05 - 23:09)
source (23:08 - 23:12)
meiku is that what this is I guess well (23:09 - 23:15)
I me it could be but isn't a completely (23:12 - 23:17)
foreign concept that might be closer to (23:15 - 23:20)
what this is she does have like some (23:17 - 23:24)
rules she also has like a bio like she's (23:20 - 23:27)
16 years old she will always be 16 uh (23:24 - 23:29)
she's 5'2 (23:27 - 23:33)
that's uh 158 CM for our non-freedom uh (23:29 - 23:37)
listeners uh she weighs 93 lbs uh they (23:33 - 23:40)
suggest that she does pop rock dance (23:37 - 23:43)
house techno crossover they suggest that (23:40 - 23:46)
her Tempo range should be between 70 and (23:43 - 23:47)
150 (23:46 - 23:51)
bpm um I know there was a dude in Japan (23:47 - 23:53)
that got married to her and that was (23:51 - 23:59)
like legal and okay yeah fans were mad (23:53 - 24:01)
he married her I think there's a couple (23:59 - 24:03)
of things that like apply here that we (24:01 - 24:06)
are familiar with like the Vocaloid (24:03 - 24:10)
software is proprietary so a group did (24:06 - 24:14)
make the vocal Aid software it is open (24:10 - 24:16)
source but there is licensing with it (24:14 - 24:18)
because it is proprietary (24:16 - 24:21)
so there is that aspect of it which is (24:18 - 24:23)
the Vocaloid part of it then if you're (24:21 - 24:26)
going to talk about the character design (24:23 - 24:29)
the character Design Falls under (24:26 - 24:32)
Creative Commons (24:29 - 24:37)
non-commercial so if it's so create (24:32 - 24:39)
so this came up a lot with the D andd (24:37 - 24:42)
stuff Creative Commons means anybody can (24:39 - 24:46)
use it but not for commercial use so you (24:42 - 24:49)
can use it in your own personal products (24:46 - 24:50)
you can use it for things that really (24:49 - 24:53)
get close to commercial use but they I (24:50 - 24:55)
make a YouTube video of (24:53 - 24:58)
it with her because that's not really (24:55 - 25:01)
commercial that's just right me (24:58 - 25:03)
making that also isn't all Creative (25:01 - 25:05)
Commons that's just Creative Commons (25:03 - 25:07)
non-commercial right non-commercial so (25:05 - 25:08)
Creative Commons covers a lot of things (25:07 - 25:11)
and this one seems is under I believe if (25:08 - 25:13)
I'm looking things up right Creative (25:11 - 25:15)
Commons non-commercial and then if you (25:13 - 25:17)
want to use it for commercial things (25:15 - 25:22)
then you have to talk to XYZ so it's it (25:17 - 25:26)
exists future media I'm assuming (25:22 - 25:30)
yeah it it just exist in a very unusual (25:26 - 25:35)
Middle Ground of sort of Open Source but (25:30 - 25:37)
not really if you're a (25:35 - 25:39)
business (25:37 - 25:42)
um proprietary meaning that there are (25:39 - 25:45)
very specific ways you have to use it (25:42 - 25:47)
but also as long as you're within those (25:45 - 25:50)
guidelines you're free to do whatever uh (25:47 - 25:52)
without necessarily having to pay money (25:50 - 25:55)
for that so it it's I mean it is (25:52 - 25:57)
complicated (25:55 - 25:58)
but (25:57 - 26:01)
not I mean it's pretty well spelled out (25:58 - 26:03)
like if you just go look up say I want (26:01 - 26:05)
to use TSO for this they're pretty clear (26:03 - 26:06)
about whether you can or cannot do that (26:05 - 26:09)
and if you have to pay somebody she she (26:06 - 26:13)
did perform at Coachella in 2020 mhm yep (26:09 - 26:15)
oh she was uh supposed to perform but (26:13 - 26:18)
that was canceled because of Co my bad (26:15 - 26:19)
but she did perform somewhere CU there (26:18 - 26:23)
was a hologram at performance at some (26:19 - 26:26)
point oh yeah um (26:23 - 26:30)
so yeah this this collaboration is very (26:26 - 26:32)
big (26:30 - 26:36)
um and if I if I click on the project (26:32 - 26:38)
voltage website uh it says this site can (26:36 - 26:43)
only be accessed from Japan so um yep uh (26:38 - 26:47)
I maybe if uh VPN sponsored the show I (26:43 - 26:49)
don't actually think there's a I don't (26:47 - 26:52)
actually think that that's this episode (26:49 - 26:57)
but you could access it uh using a VPN (26:52 - 26:58)
uh I don't know what that website looks (26:57 - 27:00)
like I again a lot of a lot of the (26:58 - 27:03)
images of uh Miku of her outfits and (27:00 - 27:05)
stuff is just like what I see on Twitter (27:03 - 27:07)
and it's cool cuz like there was like (27:05 - 27:10)
one with her and like R Tom and then (27:07 - 27:12)
people did like more fan art of that oh (27:10 - 27:15)
yeah I've seen a lot of fan art so (27:12 - 27:16)
people really like meiku that's why I (27:15 - 27:19)
was like hesitant to cover this because (27:16 - 27:22)
I didn't I I cannot I can't do service (27:19 - 27:25)
to Miku I I don't I'm not that's that's (27:22 - 27:29)
a that's a hole I've never (27:25 - 27:31)
dig into a lot you have to dig into a (27:29 - 27:33)
lot of legalities and what it mean and (27:31 - 27:35)
like I mean it's not just legalities (27:33 - 27:40)
it's like 15 almost 20 years of oh yeah (27:35 - 27:43)
of what it is and how it's I don't know (27:40 - 27:48)
of of fans and content and story and (27:43 - 27:50)
characters Vocaloid has always kind of (27:48 - 27:53)
intimidated me yeah it's cool though (27:50 - 27:56)
look all I have to know is hatso arrived (27:53 - 28:00)
the same year of the iPhone did (27:56 - 28:03)
2007 how was he in 2004 maybe that was (28:00 - 28:06)
just Vocaloid that was Vocaloid like the (28:03 - 28:08)
actual heavy promotion of hatsun Miko (28:06 - 28:12)
was 20 2007 2008 okay in that in that (28:08 - 28:13)
time frame when they're like hey use (28:12 - 28:15)
this (28:13 - 28:18)
character and (28:15 - 28:18)
then and then it blew up it blew up uh (28:19 - 28:26)
speaking of blowing up uh I think we're (28:23 - 28:30)
done with Van go I think think that's (28:26 - 28:33)
all out the window now I think it came (28:30 - 28:35)
and went (28:33 - 28:37)
um as (28:35 - 28:41)
predicted uh no time no date no heads up (28:37 - 28:44)
just hopefully you were sitting in front (28:41 - 28:47)
of your computer uh with your email open (28:44 - 28:52)
saying spend $30 get the card uh it (28:47 - 28:55)
lasted let's be generous and say it (28:52 - 28:57)
lasted about an hour that's if the (28:55 - 29:01)
website worked for you shout out to (28:57 - 29:05)
dozens of people who messaged me in in (29:01 - 29:08)
the first 15 minutes being like I got (29:05 - 29:12)
blocked just by opening the website yeah (29:08 - 29:16)
oh yeah and and they they tried to I was (29:12 - 29:18)
like use a different browser I was like (29:16 - 29:21)
try your iPhone with like no Wi-Fi (29:18 - 29:22)
connected and they're like I can't I (29:21 - 29:24)

I I will say I got the card I didn't I I (29:29 - 29:35)
was I was not in the shower I was in my (29:32 - 29:39)
bed I was literally looking at my email (29:35 - 29:40)
when the email came (29:39 - 29:43)
in and I (29:40 - 29:44)
went (29:43 - 29:47)
and this is the this is the not the (29:44 - 29:49)
worst part about this whole there's a (29:47 - 29:51)
lot of things bad about the van go (29:49 - 29:54)
situation I bought junk I bought (29:51 - 29:56)
something I didn't need to get this card (29:54 - 30:00)
you know what I wanted want a pika a (29:56 - 30:02)
Pikachu plush I wanted him holding the (30:00 - 30:03)

plush that's what I wanted I wanted all (30:07 - 30:10)
any really anything from the van go (30:09 - 30:14)

instead I was like okay maybe I'll just (30:14 - 30:19)
get some 151 that's all sold out that's (30:16 - 30:21)
like the newest TCG set you had to buy (30:19 - 30:25)
$30 worth of TCG stuff to get this card (30:21 - 30:28)
um they were out of 151 (30:25 - 30:31)
I didn't really want anything older than (30:28 - 30:32)
that I guess I could have got like the (30:31 - 30:36)
booster packs um they had those in stock (30:32 - 30:37)
I was like ah I don't know and then all (30:36 - 30:40)
of a sudden the website started like you (30:37 - 30:42)

thing that happened like two years ago (31:17 - 31:23)
and open the whole calendar in a single (31:19 - 31:23)
instance um and then it sold out like if (31:25 - 31:33)
you weren't there within around the time (31:29 - 31:35)
that email went out I mean they did (31:33 - 31:38)
tweet on time they did tweet like a (31:35 - 31:40)
minute after the email went out they did (31:38 - 31:44)
update socials but it's gone and now it (31:40 - 31:46)
it's done (31:44 - 31:52)
so on the plus side of all of this is (31:46 - 31:55)
when this card originally came out it (31:52 - 31:59)
was around 34 $400 on eBay it was (31:55 - 32:01)
selling for that you can look at past (31:59 - 32:02)
sellings there was there was only one (32:01 - 32:04)
card that sold for like $600 I still (32:02 - 32:06)
think that one was (32:04 - 32:11)
like fake in the way of like up bidding (32:06 - 32:15)
um and then within 20 within 48 Hours (32:11 - 32:18)
That C dropped to about $100 to $120 and (32:15 - 32:21)
that was because they everyone finally (32:18 - 32:22)
understood that it was coming to Pokemon (32:21 - 32:24)
Center it will be on Pokemon Center you (32:22 - 32:26)
don't have to go to Amsterdam to get the (32:24 - 32:30)
card and then it said at $120 until this (32:26 - 32:32)
distribution this last one and now if (32:30 - 32:35)
you look um it ranges anywhere between (32:32 - 32:39)
$50 and $60 so releasing the card again (32:35 - 32:42)
multiple times did drive the price down (32:39 - 32:44)
and this was the the point I was trying (32:42 - 32:47)
to drive home an episode or two ago is (32:44 - 32:50)
even if the Pokemon (32:47 - 32:53)
company like on their website put up (32:50 - 32:56)
like the Pikachu plush and was like hey (32:53 - 32:58)
you can pre-order this plush every (32:56 - 33:01)
pre-order will come with this card the (32:58 - 33:03)
plushes might not ship until like (33:01 - 33:05)
December or January because we have to (33:03 - 33:08)
make them again it would have drove all (33:05 - 33:10)
of that price down on eBay and then (33:08 - 33:12)
those scalpers standing outside of the (33:10 - 33:13)
museum would be (33:12 - 33:16)
like well yep no one want and they would (33:13 - 33:19)
have left and it would have fixed two (33:16 - 33:21)
problems I'm so mad about this they (33:19 - 33:24)
would have fixed two problems at (33:21 - 33:24)
once it would have it would have solved (33:24 - 33:28)
the the scalper standing outside of the (33:27 - 33:30)
museum and it would have solved all the (33:28 - 33:33)
people that just wanted the card or all (33:30 - 33:34)
the people who just wanted a plush cuz (33:33 - 33:36)
that that wasn't the same there were I (33:34 - 33:38)
know plenty of people who don't care (33:36 - 33:41)
about the card at all they just wanted a (33:38 - 33:42)
sunf flora painting they just wanted the (33:41 - 33:45)
plush they just wanted to pin they don't (33:42 - 33:47)
like not everyone cares about the card (33:45 - 33:49)
but when you attach the card to (33:47 - 33:50)
something (33:49 - 33:53)
else that's where it all goes (33:50 - 33:56)
south like there's another Museum plush (33:53 - 33:58)
I don't know if I said this last week (33:56 - 33:59)
there's another Museum plush on the (33:58 - 34:02)
store the the one in California the co (33:59 - 34:05)
Kay Museum plush it's been it's been up (34:02 - 34:07)
there for three months that museum (34:05 - 34:09)
exhibit is free in California I think we (34:07 - 34:11)
talked about that I think we have talked (34:09 - 34:13)
about that on the show um that plush (34:11 - 34:16)
didn't sell out you know why because (34:13 - 34:17)
there wasn't a card attached to it also (34:16 - 34:19)
to be fair I think van go is a lot more (34:17 - 34:20)
popular (34:19 - 34:25)
than the the co gave me but still still (34:20 - 34:28)
still it's still one of the limited (34:25 - 34:29)
edition Pikachu plush and I feel like (34:28 - 34:33)
people collect those too yeah (34:29 - 34:35)
yeah uh I think right now it says like (34:33 - 34:37)
limit 10 but I think when they initially (34:35 - 34:39)
released it on the website it said limit (34:37 - 34:42)
2 so maybe they expected to sell a lot (34:39 - 34:44)
more of (34:42 - 34:47)
that anyways uh the museum did refund me (34:44 - 34:50)
my tickets they were like oh we're sorry (34:47 - 34:52)
you don't want to come to our Museum (34:50 - 34:57)
anymore um I got my flight refunded well (34:52 - 35:01)
Delta Credit which I'll use refunded (34:57 - 35:06)
wink I'll use it um but man again I (35:01 - 35:08)
think this is the final chapter of being (35:06 - 35:10)
very soured on what could have been a (35:08 - 35:12)
cool (35:10 - 35:12)
collaboration mimikyu's in unite (35:14 - 35:21)
now uh yeah you want to talk about that (35:18 - 35:22)
uh I (35:21 - 35:24)
mean yeah I mean there's not much to (35:22 - 35:26)
talk about they did a huge finally (35:24 - 35:29)
balance patch so the game is playable (35:26 - 35:33)
again so you can have a lot of fun mimik (35:29 - 35:35)
looks really fun again it's only gems (35:33 - 35:37)
right now it's not been released for (35:35 - 35:40)
coins so this time next week it'll be (35:37 - 35:42)
out for coins it looks really really fun (35:40 - 35:44)
it seems to be a combination of a (35:42 - 35:46)
Speedster SL all-arounder it's got some (35:44 - 35:47)
good jumping (35:46 - 35:51)
around capabilities again since they did (35:47 - 35:54)
the re it did the rebalance it is now (35:51 - 35:56)
technically overpowered because it was (35:54 - 35:59)
released at the standard level uh and (35:56 - 35:59)
they (35:59 - 36:02)
nerfed many things across the board (35:59 - 36:04)
making the game much more enjoyable (36:02 - 36:05)
again the Halloween event is also (36:04 - 36:07)
happening do you remember the Halloween (36:05 - 36:08)
event where you turn people into (36:07 - 36:11)
pumpkins yeah yeah yeah yeah that's back (36:08 - 36:12)
so you can do the Halloween pumpkin (36:11 - 36:14)
event (36:12 - 36:18)
uh so unite is back in a better place (36:14 - 36:20)
mimikyu is here super cute it's got its (36:18 - 36:22)
disguise and so it's head bre is it like (36:20 - 36:25)
only gems right now it's only gems right (36:22 - 36:27)
now they're still doing that for like a (36:25 - 36:30)
week right yep so next week it'll be (36:27 - 36:33)
coins uh I don't know how how many coins (36:30 - 36:36)
probably 12 could be 14 they've upped (36:33 - 36:37)
the amount of coins pretty much across (36:36 - 36:41)
the board you know ingame inflation is a (36:37 - 36:45)
a real thing uh so could be 12 could be (36:41 - 36:47)
14 um I have so many coins I'm just (36:45 - 36:49)
probably going to buy it once it's for (36:47 - 36:50)
coins because it's super cute and it (36:49 - 36:52)
looks fun (36:50 - 36:56)
um so they fixed the Mewtwo problem they (36:52 - 36:58)
fixed the Mewtwo Problem by nerfing (36:56 - 37:03)
Mewtwo Y into the literal ground so he's (36:58 - 37:06)
bad now no one no one playing (37:03 - 37:09)
him it's never going to be bad but (37:06 - 37:12)
whereas it had previously it had so its (37:09 - 37:15)
first I want say it's like its first (37:12 - 37:18)
Seven Levels it had a 10% chance to grit (37:15 - 37:20)
and then its second set up to 15 it had (37:18 - 37:22)
a 5% chance to crit which meant it crit (37:20 - 37:26)
all the time uh it now has a 0% chance (37:22 - 37:28)
to crit (37:26 - 37:31)
because it was so bad uh they changed a (37:28 - 37:32)
lot of the steps they us a lot of timers (37:31 - 37:36)
it's still very powerful but it is (37:32 - 37:38)
not (37:36 - 37:40)
overwhelming it's also they nerfed (37:38 - 37:43)
Blissey so that combination isn't an (37:40 - 37:44)
immediate like let's just surrender in (37:43 - 37:46)
the first three minutes because you'll (37:44 - 37:50)
never win um both of those got (37:46 - 37:52)
significant uh Nerf in the P what (37:50 - 37:55)
happened to uh k (37:52 - 37:55)
zachian (37:56 - 38:01)
uh Mewtwo Y and (37:58 - 38:06)
blissy is what happened like what it lit (38:01 - 38:10)
blissy K zachian all on a team yeah oh (38:06 - 38:12)
that has happened and (38:10 - 38:15)
it's a nightmare to play against it is (38:12 - 38:20)
just awful um they nerfed K pretty bad (38:15 - 38:24)
when they nerfed zachian uh made they (38:20 - 38:26)
made them more deal withth but then the (38:24 - 38:28)
M like it's hard to (38:26 - 38:31)
say the Mewtwo problem was a Mewtwo (38:28 - 38:33)
problem for so long we're all trying to (38:31 - 38:36)
figure out what a post apocalyptic world (38:33 - 38:38)
looks like now that Mewtwo Y has been (38:36 - 38:40)
taken care of and Mewtwo X has been (38:38 - 38:44)
taken care of so it's hard to say if (38:40 - 38:46)
like zashi and K is going to come back (38:44 - 38:48)
up top I've seen it a couple of times (38:46 - 38:51)
but they're not that hard to deal with (38:48 - 38:54)
they just we all know sort of now how to (38:51 - 38:55)
deal with them when you see them like (38:54 - 38:59)
you know they're not also one shot one (38:55 - 39:01)
kill like they look at you and you're (38:59 - 39:03)
dead like Mewtwo Y was just like I'm (39:01 - 39:05)
across I'm all the way over here and I'm (39:03 - 39:06)
just going to shoot two things at you (39:05 - 39:09)
and then you're gone they also really (39:06 - 39:13)
changed Mewtwo y's Mega meter so it does (39:09 - 39:16)
not turn into Mega as (39:13 - 39:20)
fast uh which helps immensely because it (39:16 - 39:22)
was just like it would be up around the (39:20 - 39:23)
map and then suddenly shoot down we're (39:22 - 39:26)
like oh it's about to turn Mega and that (39:23 - 39:28)
doesn't happen as much um (39:26 - 39:31)
overall this last patch (39:28 - 39:35)
really really fixed the game um I (39:31 - 39:36)
stopped playing so I'm back playing I (39:35 - 39:38)
stopped playing for two weeks because it (39:36 - 39:39)
was just (39:38 - 39:41)
so frustrating and everything was the (39:39 - 39:44)
same they really buffed Blazin so now (39:41 - 39:48)
Blazin players are really happy um (39:44 - 39:49)
Blazin is actually a force to be dealt (39:48 - 39:51)
with whereas before people weren't (39:49 - 39:53)
playing it because you could never get (39:51 - 39:55)
close to meww Y it had to get close it (39:53 - 39:57)
was like well you'll be dead before you (39:55 - 40:00)
get there now now there's a lot of (39:57 - 40:03)
blazen players I see Blazin in almost (40:00 - 40:08)
every game um so this last patch was a (40:03 - 40:10)
really good patch I think everybody (40:08 - 40:12)
across the board is like the game is (40:10 - 40:15)
playable again it's fun again mimiku is (40:12 - 40:17)
here it's super good everybody I know (40:15 - 40:20)
who's played it has loved it so far like (40:17 - 40:23)
it's a super fun play style um you can (40:20 - 40:26)
jump around the screen a lot so I think (40:23 - 40:27)
the game is a good place so if you just (40:26 - 40:30)
wanted to try it out for the Halloween (40:27 - 40:33)
stuff and just jump in it's it's in a (40:30 - 40:36)
balanced place right now the season (40:33 - 40:39)
isn't going to reset for a few weeks or (40:36 - 40:41)
maybe a week I forget where we're at but (40:39 - 40:43)
you can jump in the Halloween event (40:41 - 40:45)
where you turn every in pumpkins is (40:43 - 40:46)
super fun it takes you five minutes and (40:45 - 40:49)
you're shooting pumpkins at people yeah (40:46 - 40:51)
it's a good (40:49 - 40:53)
time all right well uh let's take a (40:51 - 40:56)
break uh when we come back we will uh (40:53 - 40:59)
give you our thoughts on Mr detective (40:56 - 41:03)
Pikachu we will be right (40:59 - 41:07)
back and we are back from our break (41:03 - 41:11)
detective Pikachu return (41:07 - 41:15)
returns uh which is probably one of the (41:11 - 41:19)
worst named sequels ever I mean it's (41:15 - 41:21)
better than detective Pikachu to search (41:19 - 41:24)
for Curly's (41:21 - 41:27)
gold but like then people would the (41:24 - 41:28)
amount of people I had come into my (41:27 - 41:31)
twitch stream being like oh they may is (41:28 - 41:35)
this is this the movie no oh no is this (41:31 - 41:39)
a remake of the first one no is is this (41:35 - 41:39)
a (41:39 - 41:42)
sequel yes oh wait they made a they made (41:39 - 41:46)
one but just like so confused of what (41:42 - 41:48)
this was I think it's the timeline (41:46 - 41:50)
that's more confusing than the name (41:48 - 41:53)
makes zero sense I had somebody go like (41:50 - 41:55)
why is Tim White I was like yep in the (41:53 - 41:57)
movie he's not (41:55 - 42:01)
yep although hey they addressed that in (41:57 - 42:04)
the game thank you very much they do (42:01 - 42:05)
they do okay (42:04 - 42:09)
um there there there's a there's a lot (42:05 - 42:11)
that we can talk about that isn't the (42:09 - 42:13)
game itself but just a minor spoiler (42:11 - 42:16)
warning that you know we might spoil (42:13 - 42:18)
what happens in chapter one or two uh (42:16 - 42:21)
also full disclosure here Nintendo sent (42:18 - 42:23)
me a free copy of detective Pikachu (42:21 - 42:26)
returns I was going to spend the I (42:23 - 42:28)
probably probably I probably will (42:26 - 42:30)
probably spend the (42:28 - 42:34)
$50 for a physical copy just for my own (42:30 - 42:35)
collection but they sent me a digital (42:34 - 42:37)
copy maybe I'll wait for the Black (42:35 - 42:40)
Friday sale you (42:37 - 42:41)
wait (42:40 - 42:44)
um so there there's a lot to say let's (42:41 - 42:45)
let's start off with Hannah though who (42:44 - 42:49)
did pay $50 for this video game uh so (42:45 - 42:52)
did I yeah well I we're starting with (42:49 - 42:56)
Hannah uh you played the first one right (42:52 - 42:59)
no I actually didn't oh oh G play the (42:56 - 43:01)
first one I watched somebody else play (42:59 - 43:04)
the first one in the last couple weeks (43:01 - 43:06)
because I needed to recap it for myself (43:04 - 43:08)
so I could understand better okay well (43:06 - 43:11)
give me your initial impression like (43:08 - 43:12)
what do you think did you are you happy (43:11 - 43:16)
with your $50 are you enjoying it what's (43:12 - 43:19)
instant regret not my kind well I don't (43:16 - 43:21)
know I I would have enjoyed it a lot as (43:19 - 43:26)
a kid um at this point I feel like I'm (43:21 - 43:30)
falling asleep every time I try to play (43:26 - 43:33)
it I I actually did fall asleep the (43:30 - 43:35)
first time I I was playing it for a (43:33 - 43:39)
couple hours um granted I didn't sleep (43:35 - 43:42)
well the night before I am enjoying it I (43:39 - 43:44)
think I don't find it that boring it's (43:42 - 43:48)
just slow put that on the put that on (43:44 - 43:52)
the back of the box I am enjoying it I (43:48 - 43:55)
look jury's (43:52 - 43:58)
out (43:55 - 43:58)
yep so so are but do you regret the $50 (43:59 - 44:05)
are you like (44:03 - 44:09)
ah considering I'm where Greg was a few (44:05 - 44:11)
weeks months ago and looking for a job (44:09 - 44:15)
without pop right now uh maybe (44:11 - 44:18)
regretting the $50 just considering that (44:15 - 44:20)
situation (44:18 - 44:24)
but I I don't know if it was a $50 game (44:20 - 44:26)
I it feels like a switch game which in (44:24 - 44:29)
my head means that's 50 (44:26 - 44:33)
bucks or 60 bucks uh I don't buy many of (44:29 - 44:35)
the indie games because this is a (44:33 - 44:37)
Pokemon game I don't think of it is an (44:35 - 44:39)
indie game it's a Pokemon game on the (44:37 - 44:43)
switch I'm not surprised it costs H I'm (44:39 - 44:45)
actually kind of surprised it costs $50 (44:43 - 44:47)
because I would be more surprised if or (44:45 - 44:49)
less surprised if it cost (44:47 - 44:52)
60 I was surprised that it was (44:49 - 44:55)
50 don't know if that means it's worth (44:52 - 44:58)
it (44:55 - 44:58)
uh Greg you you beat the game although (44:58 - 45:02)
we're not talking about the ending I (45:01 - 45:05)
have completed the game I know the (45:02 - 45:08)
secret ending I know all of its Secrets (45:05 - 45:10)
um but you you you played the first one (45:08 - 45:13)
so y you kind of knew what to expect (45:10 - 45:14)
game (45:13 - 45:19)
playwise and you still spent the 50 (45:14 - 45:22)
bucks so I don't mean that negatively (45:19 - 45:24)
like trying to like frame (45:22 - 45:27)
expectations I did know on some level (45:24 - 45:28)
what to (45:27 - 45:31)
expect (45:28 - 45:31)
um I think it looks bad for a switch (45:32 - 45:40)
game um the first like five minutes (45:36 - 45:42)
before I just kind of got into it and (45:40 - 45:44)
gave it up I'm like this looks like a (45:42 - 45:48)
direct to DVD CGI movie like it just (45:44 - 45:51)
isn't good they don't really move (45:48 - 45:54)
naturally everything just feels off and (45:51 - 45:57)
cheap and it does not look (45:54 - 46:01)
like I should be paying $50 for a switch (45:57 - 46:02)
game because it doesn't really look like (46:01 - 46:04)
a good switch (46:02 - 46:06)
game (46:04 - 46:10)
um I I think it is I think it is way (46:06 - 46:14)
overpriced for what you get (46:10 - 46:18)
um I do think it does a few things (46:14 - 46:20)
really well I do think it can make the (46:18 - 46:22)
case that there should be voice acting (46:20 - 46:24)
in Pokemon games because it switches (46:22 - 46:27)
between voice scenes and text scenes (46:24 - 46:29)
just fine and I think the times that (46:27 - 46:31)
they do do voice and I think the voice (46:29 - 46:35)
acting that they do do is good is there (46:31 - 46:37)
less voice acting in this one than the (46:35 - 46:40)
last one I feel like the cut scenes are (46:37 - 46:43)
shorter than the ones I (46:40 - 46:45)
saw it depends on where you are in the (46:43 - 46:47)
game some of the cut scenes get real (46:45 - 46:50)
long (46:47 - 46:50)
okay how you you recently watched like (46:50 - 46:54)
somebody play through it there besides (46:53 - 46:57)
Pikachu cuz obviously it's Pik Pikachu (46:54 - 46:59)
has the gruff like detective Voice or (46:57 - 47:02)
whatever but how (46:59 - 47:05)
many the characters are the human (47:02 - 47:07)
characters in the first one were voice (47:05 - 47:10)
acted right yeah but not all of (47:07 - 47:14)
them no not all of them but like your (47:10 - 47:17)
Tim your love interest and then there (47:14 - 47:20)
was like another character that kept (47:17 - 47:22)
appearing I mean there were Side (47:20 - 47:24)
characters and small occasional (47:22 - 47:26)
appearance characters who had voes too (47:24 - 47:28)
they may have been voice acted by the (47:26 - 47:30)
same people as the bigger characters but (47:28 - 47:32)
I didn't look it up just kind of seemed (47:30 - 47:34)
that way kind of seems that way in this (47:32 - 47:36)
one too when when people were like was (47:34 - 47:37)
the first game voice acted I was like (47:36 - 47:40)
yeah because like Pikachu's voice was (47:37 - 47:42)
the talking point of the first game but (47:40 - 47:44)
then I was like it's been five years I (47:42 - 47:46)
don't remember I don't remember like how (47:44 - 47:49)
much voice acting was in the first one (47:46 - 47:53)
about four hours worth yeah (47:49 - 47:58)
yep um over all I (47:53 - 48:01)
really I struggle to understand who this (47:58 - 48:04)
game is made for oh my God you you're (48:01 - 48:07)
secretly reading my question sheet cuz (48:04 - 48:10)
that was that's a very good question to (48:07 - 48:14)
ask of like who exactly is this game for (48:10 - 48:17)
because the puzzles and the writing is (48:14 - 48:22)
so simplistic and so frustrating where (48:17 - 48:23)
you're like (48:22 - 48:26)
H right there everybody is looking right (48:23 - 48:28)
at it and yet we're like what are these (48:26 - 48:32)
things and I'm like I we stop pointing (48:28 - 48:35)
it out for the 400th time we know by now (48:32 - 48:37)
so it seems to be written for a very (48:35 - 48:41)
young audience but it moves at a snails (48:37 - 48:44)
pace and I cannot imagine the young (48:41 - 48:46)
audience that it's written for having (48:44 - 48:49)
the patience to play this (48:46 - 48:52)
game okay well that we should stop there (48:49 - 48:55)
game is not what this is no I mean it is (48:52 - 48:58)
a it's a visual novel with it's a visual (48:55 - 49:00)
novel which the first game was a visual (48:58 - 49:05)
novel yeah um I mean there are some gy (49:00 - 49:07)
elements in it there are some things (49:05 - 49:10)
where you have to like be aware (49:07 - 49:13)
of the guards movements so you can get (49:10 - 49:15)
around them or the Pokemon's movements (49:13 - 49:18)
so you can so there's some gamey (49:15 - 49:20)
elements in it it is not the majority of (49:18 - 49:22)
that game it is mostly a visual (49:20 - 49:25)
novel which which is which when when I (49:22 - 49:27)
say visual no I don't think that's a bad (49:25 - 49:30)
thing no um like two of my favorite (49:27 - 49:33)
games I don't visual novels are gone (49:30 - 49:37)
home uh which is a $20 game well (49:33 - 49:39)
probably when it came out was $20 and it (49:37 - 49:40)
was a (49:39 - 49:44)
2hour game SL visual novel again what (49:40 - 49:45)
I'm going to use those words (49:44 - 49:47)
interchangeably but like gone home is a (49:45 - 49:50)
visual novel um and people were upset (49:47 - 49:52)
about gone home at the time because it (49:50 - 49:56)
was like oh I'm paying $10 an hour for a (49:52 - 50:01)
game visual novel uh which to me I 100% (49:56 - 50:04)
got my two hours worth of that (50:01 - 50:07)
experience I if you don't know what gone (50:04 - 50:09)
home is don't look anything up about it (50:07 - 50:10)
and if you like visual novels you should (50:09 - 50:13)
go play it it's good (50:10 - 50:16)
and knowing what I know about our (50:13 - 50:17)
audience who listens to the show you (50:16 - 50:20)
will like (50:17 - 50:23)
it um it's not spooky uh although it (50:20 - 50:25)
does present itself it it does present (50:23 - 50:26)
itself as like oh there's going to be (50:25 - 50:29)
jump scares it's it's not a spooky game (50:26 - 50:31)
um it's just telling a story the other (50:29 - 50:33)
game I really really like was firewatch (50:31 - 50:36)
which again was visual novel there are (50:33 - 50:39)
some game elements in firewatch but it's (50:36 - 50:41)
telling a story uh and that I think was (50:39 - 50:44)
a $30 game when it came out and it was (50:41 - 50:48)
about 4 hours 5 hours long it was (50:44 - 50:50)
relatively short same complaints as gone (50:48 - 50:52)
home I will (50:50 - 50:56)
say this is a very long visual novel uh (50:52 - 50:58)
uh the average completion time on how (50:56 - 51:01)
long to beat is 12 hours completionist (50:58 - 51:05)
is 14 hours fastest time was like 11 (51:01 - 51:11)
hours um I I can't say like because it's (51:05 - 51:13)
making you do a lot of busy work there's (51:11 - 51:16)
just a lot of reading and that's what a (51:13 - 51:18)
visual novel (51:16 - 51:21)
is uh but I can't disagree with Greg of (51:18 - 51:27)
like it feels slow but at the same time (51:21 - 51:28)
like it's not like you're getting (51:27 - 51:30)
repeating dialogue it's just like all (51:28 - 51:32)
the characters are just kind of dumb (51:30 - 51:36)
yeah I mean it it it would (51:32 - 51:36)
be hard to it'd be less frustrating if (51:36 - 51:41)
everybody (51:39 - 51:44)
didn't get written as completely (51:41 - 51:46)
unintelligent (51:44 - 51:51)
like they talk about things in ways (51:46 - 51:53)
where you're (51:51 - 51:57)
like no (51:53 - 52:00)
you don't need to say it this slowly it (51:57 - 52:03)
forces you into sections where you have (52:00 - 52:08)
to move slowly for no good reasons it (52:03 - 52:10)
forces you to go to places where things (52:08 - 52:14)
just take a lot of time and it's you're (52:10 - 52:16)
kind of like okay it's kind of fine in (52:14 - 52:17)
the first two chapters and then you hit (52:16 - 52:20)
chapter three and you're (52:17 - 52:20)
[Music] (52:21 - 52:25)
like there's just too much I don't know (52:22 - 52:27)
if chapter 4 is better than chapter 3 (52:25 - 52:30)
but chapter 3 was awful in I I'm trying (52:27 - 52:31)
to remember which is chapter 3 and which (52:30 - 52:35)
is chapter 4 okay so chapter one is the (52:31 - 52:37)
is the jewelry Thief right which I (52:35 - 52:39)
actually think is a really good opening (52:37 - 52:41)
chapter it's a good opening chapter like (52:39 - 52:44)
it reintroduces you everything it moves (52:41 - 52:46)
it moves at a decent pace like a couple (52:44 - 52:48)
of times when you have to do like the (52:46 - 52:50)
the the smell sniff thing and I'm like (52:48 - 52:54)
oh boy that's move faster (52:50 - 52:56)
that's come on (52:54 - 52:59)
yeah so like chapter one so here's (52:56 - 53:02)
here's the thing that I liked like gosh (52:59 - 53:04)
I have so much to say when people came (53:02 - 53:06)
into my stream and they were like is (53:04 - 53:07)
this worth (53:06 - 53:10)
$50 I I would tell them (53:07 - 53:14)
genuinely no and the reason it's a no is (53:10 - 53:16)
because you're asking that (53:14 - 53:19)
question if you played the first (53:16 - 53:22)
detective Pikachu and you were curious (53:19 - 53:26)
about this you knew exactly what your gu (53:22 - 53:28)
and if you did not play the first (53:26 - 53:31)
detective Pikachu and you're asking if (53:28 - 53:33)
this is $50 then this game is not for (53:31 - 53:36)
you because there was probably a (53:33 - 53:38)
plethora of reasons why you skipped the (53:36 - 53:40)
first one it wasn't interesting to you (53:38 - 53:43)
it was too much money not your type of (53:40 - 53:46)
game like you probably had a lot of (53:43 - 53:48)
reasons why you didn't buy the first one (53:46 - 53:52)
so there's nothing in this sequel (53:48 - 53:55)
that would be worth it to you in my my (53:52 - 53:57)
opinion that's why like the hannnah (53:55 - 53:59)
situation was interesting to me but then (53:57 - 54:02)
Hannah said that no it doesn't really (53:59 - 54:05)
seem worth it because (54:02 - 54:08)
like even if you like visual novel games (54:05 - 54:10)
like go home and (54:08 - 54:12)
firewatch I don't think this is a (54:10 - 54:16)
particularly good visual novel game (54:12 - 54:20)
unless you liked the first game and so (54:16 - 54:22)
for me I'm like telling you guys it's (54:20 - 54:24)
not worth $50 but I really liked the (54:22 - 54:27)
first game but I liked it for what it (54:24 - 54:31)
was I liked how the very specific thing (54:27 - 54:34)
I like about it is how Pikachu interacts (54:31 - 54:37)
with Pokemon and that was what was the (54:34 - 54:40)
like driving force for me to complete (54:37 - 54:42)
the game I did like at the end of every (54:40 - 54:45)
chapter the like there's something very (54:42 - 54:47)
satisfying about Tim calling somebody (54:45 - 54:50)
out on being a criminal and like you (54:47 - 54:53)
piecing that together of like it was you (54:50 - 54:56)
in the laboratory with the science Cube (54:53 - 54:58)
at 2:00 in the afternoon and then (54:56 - 55:00)
everyone's like it wasn't and then like (54:58 - 55:02)
the criminal tries to backtrack and then (55:00 - 55:04)
like Tim's like no I have enough like (55:02 - 55:06)
there's that's satisfying and you do (55:04 - 55:08)
that like five times in the first game (55:06 - 55:09)
right because I think there's also five (55:08 - 55:12)
chapters but like the charm of Pikachu (55:09 - 55:14)
talking with characters and like like (55:12 - 55:16)
there's like a bunch of PS in both games (55:14 - 55:19)
actually but in the first game like you (55:16 - 55:21)
talk to the PVS and then you come back (55:19 - 55:22)
later cuz you have to ask them a (55:21 - 55:24)
question and they completely forgot who (55:22 - 55:26)
you are and it's like cuz like the pdubs (55:24 - 55:28)
can't remember more than like 2 minutes (55:26 - 55:31)
of information and so every character (55:28 - 55:34)
had like every character in the original (55:31 - 55:36)
detective Pikachu were like just oozing (55:34 - 55:38)
with personality and it was like very (55:36 - 55:40)
fun to be like oh my gosh like what kind (55:38 - 55:42)
of personality is like this klef key (55:40 - 55:44)
going to have and it was like oh this (55:42 - 55:47)
klef key is like really sassy cool like (55:44 - 55:48)
that's (55:47 - 55:52)
fun and they do that here they do but I (55:48 - 55:54)
don't even think they do it as good no (55:52 - 55:56)
or as well (55:54 - 55:57)
like (55:56 - 56:00)
I'm like and I think this is why chapter (55:57 - 56:03)
3 is like the worst chapter because so (56:00 - 56:07)
chapter one is like uh very very similar (56:03 - 56:09)
to the first detective Pikachu which is (56:07 - 56:12)
like you need to solve a crime which is (56:09 - 56:15)
like good and bad it's like your dad has (56:12 - 56:18)
been missing for two years and like the (56:15 - 56:19)
the guy who supposed to help you like (56:18 - 56:22)
find your dad is like yeah we we haven't (56:19 - 56:24)
figured anything out in 2 years but like (56:22 - 56:27)
hey this we're going to do it this time (56:24 - 56:29)
yeah this jewel is stolen so let's stop (56:27 - 56:31)
everything on your dad to like solve (56:29 - 56:33)
this Jewel the Jew and you need to help (56:31 - 56:35)
me with it so like that's like (56:33 - 56:38)
frustrating but like that case is fun in (56:35 - 56:40)
my opinion like to figure it out and (56:38 - 56:42)
like when you figure out like at the (56:40 - 56:43)
very end of that case when you're like (56:42 - 56:46)
it's this Pokemon and this person and (56:43 - 56:49)
like this is how it happened like that (56:46 - 56:51)
sequence was like really fun of like we (56:49 - 56:53)
solved the case and all the Pokémon (56:51 - 56:56)
along the way were really Charming (56:53 - 56:58)
and then this the second one the second (56:56 - 57:01)
chapter you're in the like Aztec like (56:58 - 57:02)
Temple or whatever with the like sliding (57:01 - 57:05)
doors and the puzzles and I don't know I (57:02 - 57:07)
got Indiana Joan feels but yeah I mean (57:05 - 57:10)
you're in mysterious ruins because (57:07 - 57:11)
they're just around and they're always (57:10 - 57:14)
around like okay cool and that chapter's (57:11 - 57:17)
like a little bit weaker than the first (57:14 - 57:19)
one I don't think the Pokemon there are (57:17 - 57:20)
as (57:19 - 57:23)
interesting and I feel like the game (57:20 - 57:25)
literally starts to fall apart at that (57:23 - 57:26)
in instance and I'm going to give you a (57:25 - 57:31)
reason why um there are side quests in (57:26 - 57:33)
this game which are nice there's like a (57:31 - 57:35)
quiz lady and she's like I need to find (57:33 - 57:37)
a Pokemon that like has a really long (57:35 - 57:39)
tongue and you're like oh I saw a lick a (57:37 - 57:40)
tongue earlier cool it's that one and (57:39 - 57:42)
then she's like I need to find a Pokemon (57:40 - 57:44)
that's cute but like steals things and (57:42 - 57:45)
you're like oh it's probably this (57:44 - 57:49)
Pokemon I have that that (57:45 - 57:53)
part made me so frustrated because I had (57:49 - 57:55)
already met them I had already talked to (57:53 - 57:58)
to them I already knew who they were and (57:55 - 58:00)
instead of remembering that I had met (57:58 - 58:05)
them I had to go back find them again (58:00 - 58:08)
and then walk back to wherever she was (58:05 - 58:10)
did you have running speed on yeah but (58:08 - 58:13)
okay still it didn't matter that I'd (58:10 - 58:15)
already met them it didn't matter that I (58:13 - 58:17)
had met everybody already and it could (58:15 - 58:20)
tell you immediately I had to once again (58:17 - 58:24)
waste my time to go find them and then (58:20 - 58:26)
come back and I'm like this is not (58:24 - 58:31)
necessarily this is just filler time (58:26 - 58:33)
this is just (58:31 - 58:35)
frustrating because I know what you're (58:33 - 58:36)
talking (58:35 - 58:39)
about I met that Pokemon that makes your (58:36 - 58:42)
description met it on my way here and I (58:39 - 58:47)
can't just tell you it's this I have (58:42 - 58:50)
to stop the criminal (58:47 - 58:52)
investigation stop the major thing that (58:50 - 58:55)
I'm doing to walk five feet to talk to (58:52 - 58:58)
the thing again and then walk 5p back to (58:55 - 59:00)
say it's (58:58 - 59:03)
liong that didn't bother me as much cuz (59:00 - 59:05)
the the maps weren't big I think what (59:03 - 59:08)
bothered me that I that I got over was (59:05 - 59:11)
like oh I don't get anything for this (59:08 - 59:13)
like each chapter probably has like four (59:11 - 59:16)
or five side quests and they're like (59:13 - 59:18)
Puzzles they're like you know what is (59:16 - 59:20)
this Pokemon that has like really close (59:18 - 59:22)
friendship but that's really shy and (59:20 - 59:23)
you're like you kind of have to think (59:22 - 59:25)
like they they do get like slly harder (59:23 - 59:31)
but also like there's if there's the the (59:25 - 59:33)
there's only so many Pokemon on the map (59:31 - 59:35)
so you're like well if this Pokemon (59:33 - 59:37)
doesn't have to do with this side quest (59:35 - 59:38)
then it probably has to do with this (59:37 - 59:40)
side quest kind of thing so you can like (59:38 - 59:44)
eliminate it um but I think the thing (59:40 - 59:46)
that bothered me the most in Chapter 2 (59:44 - 59:48)
and why I slowly stopped wanting to do (59:46 - 59:51)
the side quest is there were a there was (59:48 - 59:55)
a minor and the minor was like I'm I'm (59:51 - 59:57)
too like my shell is too heavy to go (59:55 - 60:00)
back to my like home planet or whatever (59:57 - 60:03)
and you're like oh how do I like how do (60:00 - 60:06)
I solve this and then when you get (60:03 - 60:08)
darmanitan spoiler you ride a darmanitan (60:06 - 60:12)
in the second chapter um I was like oh I (60:08 - 60:14)
wonder if I can punch the minor and I (60:12 - 60:15)
punched it and it shell broke and I was (60:14 - 60:17)
like oh that was actually really cool (60:15 - 60:19)
like I I didn't actually think that was (60:17 - 60:20)
going to work and it worked and it was (60:19 - 60:23)
like aha very cool and then so like that (60:20 - 60:26)
minor shows that it's like yellow and (60:23 - 60:28)
then you find like another minere and (60:26 - 60:29)
you're like I'm I'm going to punch it (60:28 - 60:31)
and you punch it and then that one's (60:29 - 60:33)
like red and you're like oh cool there's (60:31 - 60:34)
like five I don't actually I think (60:33 - 60:36)
there's five minor colors maybe six (60:34 - 60:39)
Minar colors there are six Minar colors (60:36 - 60:42)
and I'm like running around this map (60:39 - 60:44)
being like there has to be six of them (60:42 - 60:47)
and there's and there's not there's (60:44 - 60:49)
three there's just three and when you (60:47 - 60:51)
punch them they like they break their (60:49 - 60:53)
shell it's a cool animation it's like (60:51 - 60:55)
very satisfying to punch Minar which is (60:53 - 60:56)
is like a really weird thing I never (60:55 - 61:00)
thought I would say and they they just (60:56 - 61:02)
don't do anything they're not even part (61:00 - 61:04)
of a side quest they're not even there's (61:02 - 61:07)
no little like satisying satisfying like (61:04 - 61:09)
check mark it's just you punch them and (61:07 - 61:10)
they're like thank you and and they (61:09 - 61:13)
leave and that was like that was more (61:10 - 61:15)
frustrating than like oh I know it's (61:13 - 61:17)
perin let me run back talk to the perin (61:15 - 61:19)
run back okay cool check mark like did (61:17 - 61:22)
it that hit some at least for me some (61:19 - 61:24)
endorphin of like at least completing a (61:22 - 61:25)
checklist (61:24 - 61:27)
there's just nothing with this Min and (61:25 - 61:29)
you're like you didn't even do all six (61:27 - 61:31)
why you didn't even do all six colors (61:29 - 61:35)
yeah I did hunt thinking there has to be (61:31 - 61:38)
six there has to be and I finally looked (61:35 - 61:39)
it up I'm (61:38 - 61:43)
like just tell me if there's six no (61:39 - 61:46)
there's three but that like like the (61:43 - 61:48)
fact that you had to look it up to be (61:46 - 61:50)
like oh I wonder if there's all six and (61:48 - 61:51)
maybe there's some part of the puzzle (61:50 - 61:53)
I'm missing and to find out there isn't (61:51 - 61:56)
like makes it even more disappointing it (61:53 - 61:57)
was just (61:56 - 62:00)
yeah I will say I don't hate the lack of (61:57 - 62:01)
checklist personally because the (62:00 - 62:04)
checklist is (62:01 - 62:06)
slow that's that's the problem I have (62:04 - 62:08)
with so much of this it's not even that (62:06 - 62:10)
the dialogue is slow and repetitive it's (62:08 - 62:13)
that no matter how fast you have it set (62:10 - 62:17)
to it takes a full second to close out (62:13 - 62:19)
of any dialogue it takes a full second (62:17 - 62:21)
to move from any character to another (62:19 - 62:24)
character it's just it's just slow to go (62:21 - 62:26)
through the game no matter how fast you (62:24 - 62:30)
have what you do it feels deliberate how (62:26 - 62:34)
slow it moves and it feels deliberate to (62:30 - 62:38)
make the game seem longer than it is and (62:34 - 62:41)
I'm not a fan of that at all so in in (62:38 - 62:44)
chapter 3 which I I really Greg tell me (62:41 - 62:46)
if chapter 4 is better than chapter 3 (62:44 - 62:49)
but in chapter 3 they they they it it's (62:46 - 62:52)
very cleverly named it's called detain (62:49 - 62:54)
Pikachu so minor spoilers here they (62:52 - 62:57)
arrest Pikachu and the whole point of (62:54 - 62:59)
arresting Pikachu well besides the story (62:57 - 63:01)
is to separate you and Tim which is (62:59 - 63:04)
probably the worst thing they could have (63:01 - 63:07)
done in this entire series because what (63:04 - 63:11)
I just said 10 minutes ago the appeal to (63:07 - 63:15)
this game is talking to Pokemon as (63:11 - 63:18)
Pikachu and when you're Tim and you're (63:15 - 63:20)
walking around the world seeing a (63:18 - 63:23)
hattena seeing failinks seeing lilligant (63:20 - 63:28)
seeing a aom you can't talk to them you (63:23 - 63:32)
can like you're going to hate chapter (63:28 - 63:32)
4 so it's like look at this liton and (63:33 - 63:38)
Glameow like laying on top of each other (63:35 - 63:41)
that's so cute that like draws me into (63:38 - 63:44)
this world I want to know about this lit (63:41 - 63:48)
and PE or or Glam meow and I cannot talk (63:44 - 63:50)
to them because Pikachu is in prison he (63:48 - 63:53)
is a hardened criminal and I just don't (63:50 - 63:55)
know the story (63:53 - 63:58)
of this L and Glam meow now even if it (63:55 - 63:59)
was like three but that's the thing (63:58 - 64:01)
about the old detective Pikachu games (63:59 - 64:03)
they'll they'll say like one or two (64:01 - 64:05)
things but they're just so personalized (64:03 - 64:07)
they did such a good job in the first (64:05 - 64:11)
game of like giving like a stereotype to (64:07 - 64:14)
a Pokemon that you're just like like (64:11 - 64:16)
karant did this game and they gave (64:14 - 64:20)
karant like a very like BR stere and (64:16 - 64:24)
it's so good and if like they applied (64:20 - 64:26)
the crar (64:24 - 64:28)
treatment like whatever character they (64:26 - 64:31)
injected to all the Pokemon in this game (64:28 - 64:34)
I could probably be like it is worth $50 (64:31 - 64:37)
yeah but after the first chapter they (64:34 - 64:40)
kind of it falls apart they do it a (64:37 - 64:42)
little like there's there's nuggets like (64:40 - 64:45)
impidimp is really funny oh yeah (64:42 - 64:48)
impidimp is great and Sabai is is also (64:45 - 64:51)
somewhat interesting but like all the (64:48 - 64:52)
other ones are (64:51 - 64:56)
real are real Bland for whatever reason (64:52 - 64:58)
yeah Pangoro is like super Bland super (64:56 - 65:01)
bland liart is super Bland um like (64:58 - 65:03)
luxray is like I get what they're doing (65:01 - 65:06)
with luxuray yeah but even that doesn't (65:03 - 65:08)
pay off well I'm just going to tell you (65:06 - 65:10)
no because they there was a clear love (65:08 - 65:13)
relationship between luxray and mighten (65:10 - 65:14)
and they don't explore it at all but it (65:13 - 65:18)
is like I thought for sure like they're (65:14 - 65:21)
setting it they it never comes back (65:18 - 65:25)
never you never you you don't even run (65:21 - 65:28)
into medana again for the rest of the (65:25 - 65:32)
game just gone you had that one shot and (65:28 - 65:34)
they could have they like it was am I (65:32 - 65:36)
projecting is was that not a love (65:34 - 65:39)
interest between M and luxur I it was it (65:36 - 65:42)
it was I mean I think you're shipping (65:39 - 65:44)
them a bit it was definitely I think it (65:42 - 65:47)
was definitely a heavy friendship like (65:44 - 65:49)
misunderstanding (65:47 - 65:52)
starcross thing but (65:49 - 65:56)
uh there is a relationship there that is (65:52 - 66:00)
worth exploring that they don't do at (65:56 - 66:04)
all there are a lot of things in this (66:00 - 66:06)
game that are worth exploring that they (66:04 - 66:07)
don't do at all and I'm I'm going to (66:06 - 66:10)
tell you now you are going to (66:07 - 66:13)
be frustrated in bamboo forest as you (66:10 - 66:17)
were frustrated in in three they do a (66:13 - 66:20)
thing where you are switching between (66:17 - 66:23)
two different characters and one of (66:20 - 66:25)
those characters does not have (66:23 - 66:32)
Pikachu um and while the overall story (66:25 - 66:35)
of it isn't until the end of chapter 4 (66:32 - 66:38)
that they really start to push what the (66:35 - 66:42)
end game story is going to be it takes (66:38 - 66:45)
that long for you to finally get to the (66:42 - 66:46)
point where they are going to bring (66:45 - 66:47)
everything (66:46 - 66:50)
together and then they sort of just (66:47 - 66:52)
really Ram it through in chapter 5 cuz (66:50 - 66:54)
it's like we've got nothing else so now (66:52 - 66:56)
we have have to deal with the (66:54 - 67:00)
story and there are parts of chapter 4 (66:56 - 67:03)
that are Charming but again you are (67:00 - 67:07)
forced to switch between two different (67:03 - 67:09)
characters without really a great (67:07 - 67:12)
explanation it's (67:09 - 67:15)
really both of them move slowly one of (67:12 - 67:17)
them doesn't have Pikachu so you can't (67:15 - 67:19)
talk to the Pokemon around so you are (67:17 - 67:21)
only getting certain things and then it (67:19 - 67:24)
really doesn't come together until the (67:21 - 67:27)
last five minutes of that story and then (67:24 - 67:30)
you're like and now oh now we're moving (67:27 - 67:32)
into chapter five and I don't even get (67:30 - 67:34)
to really complete a lot of the things (67:32 - 67:37)
that was happening there I now have to (67:34 - 67:41)
go into chapter 5 I now have (67:37 - 67:44)
to solve chapter 5 that will get me to (67:41 - 67:46)
the end goal and maybe I will get the (67:44 - 67:49)
resolution there but chapter part just (67:46 - 67:53)
feels long (67:49 - 67:56)
and (67:53 - 67:59)
I think because chapter 3 dragged on so (67:56 - 68:01)
long when I got to chapter 4 and I was (67:59 - 68:02)
forced to do those things again that I (68:01 - 68:05)
was like I need I I was literally like I (68:02 - 68:07)
need to take a break I need to walk away (68:05 - 68:08)
from this game and I need to go do (68:07 - 68:11)
something fun for a while because this (68:08 - 68:14)
is super frustrating and I know that (68:11 - 68:16)
when I sit down to do this chapter I'm (68:14 - 68:20)
going to be locked into a two to 3our (68:16 - 68:25)
time period for no good reason reason it (68:20 - 68:31)
just takes forever to play this game and (68:25 - 68:33)
they introduced new characters but they (68:31 - 68:35)
don't expand on them and they aren't (68:33 - 68:38)
that interesting you can talk to some of (68:35 - 68:40)
the Pokemon but not all of them and so (68:38 - 68:42)
you just don't get a lot of the things (68:40 - 68:44)
that make it (68:42 - 68:47)
charming and then I'm going to say (68:44 - 68:50)
this if you watch a lot of (68:47 - 68:53)
anime be prepared for Trope city that is (68:50 - 68:55)
chapter 5 because it is every anime (68:53 - 68:59)
Trope that has ever existed rammed into (68:55 - 69:01)
one well chapter I don't watch a lot of (68:59 - 69:03)
anime so maybe it'll be surprising for (69:01 - 69:05)
me I mean if you've watched any (69:03 - 69:07)
Naruto you know what's going to happen (69:05 - 69:10)
in chapter 5 well here here here's the (69:07 - 69:13)
thing too is (69:10 - 69:15)
like the other thing that drove me crazy (69:13 - 69:19)
about chapter 2 and three is there's (69:15 - 69:22)
no (69:19 - 69:22)
like this game would do so much better (69:22 - 69:28)
if every chapter was just an episode of (69:25 - 69:32)
Scooby-Doo 100% like I don't I'm glad (69:28 - 69:34)
that Greg was like I know exactly what (69:32 - 69:37)
you mean I know yes 100% yes because the (69:34 - 69:40)
end of chapter 2 which like chapter 2 (69:37 - 69:43)
starts off strong and it it falls apart (69:40 - 69:45)
very fast like when you meet Slowpoke (69:43 - 69:47)
for the first time fantastic brilliant (69:45 - 69:50)
super funny I genuinely laughed out loud (69:47 - 69:52)
when I met Slowpoke for the first time (69:50 - 69:54)
when you meet like slowpokes partner (69:52 - 69:56)
which is the (69:54 - 69:58)
professor the fact that this guy has any (69:56 - 70:01)
sort of degree is insulting to anyone (69:58 - 70:04)
like you now I'm going to say that that (70:01 - 70:05)
is the most (70:04 - 70:08)
accurate depiction of a highlevel (70:05 - 70:10)
academic that has ever existed that they (70:08 - 70:12)
only care about their academics and they (70:10 - 70:15)
know nothing else if you've ever met (70:12 - 70:17)
highlevel tenur professors that is what (70:15 - 70:20)
they are they could not care about the (70:17 - 70:23)
rest of the world except for the thing (70:20 - 70:26)
that they've devoted their life to that (70:23 - 70:29)
that dude is 100% an academic but but (70:26 - 70:31)
like going back to Greg's Point like the (70:29 - 70:34)
character outside of the (70:31 - 70:37)
temple he's useless like he's useless (70:34 - 70:39)
he's there's nothing about him none of (70:37 - 70:41)
him matters at all so like that's like (70:39 - 70:44)
the first like in the first chapter with (70:41 - 70:47)
karant and everyone like everyone has a (70:44 - 70:49)
personality all their Pokemon have a (70:47 - 70:51)
personality like it's actually a really (70:49 - 70:53)
good like like if you could if you could (70:51 - 70:55)
pay five to do the first chapter of this (70:53 - 70:57)
game I would recommend it to everyone I (70:55 - 71:01)
would agree 100% also karat being an (70:57 - 71:04)
absolute criminal I'm here for it lock (71:01 - 71:10)
that lock him up but uh the the end of (71:04 - 71:12)
chapter 2 where it's not even like (71:10 - 71:16)
solving a crime it's just like I've (71:12 - 71:21)
deduced the puzzle is so (71:16 - 71:23)
underwhelming like it would be like an (71:21 - 71:25)
episode Scooby-Doo where there was no (71:23 - 71:28)
criminal and they were like we figured (71:25 - 71:30)
out how to get out of the cave does that (71:28 - 71:32)
feel satisfying to you viewer for your (71:30 - 71:35)
22 minutes of time like no no I want to (71:32 - 71:38)
call somebody a criminal and I want to (71:35 - 71:41)
see them escorted out in handcuffs and I (71:38 - 71:43)
want to hear the line I would have (71:41 - 71:45)
gotten away with it if it wasn't for (71:43 - 71:48)
your talking Pikachu that's all I want (71:45 - 71:51)
that's why I bought the game I want the (71:48 - 71:53)
satisfaction of arresting (71:51 - 71:54)
criminals (71:53 - 71:57)
and that happens in chapter one and that (71:54 - 71:59)
happens in almost every chapter of the (71:57 - 72:02)
first detective Pikachu game oh yeah (71:59 - 72:04)
yeah like every like unless I'm (72:02 - 72:06)
misremembering it you're arresting (72:04 - 72:08)
somebody every two hours in that first (72:06 - 72:10)
game everybody gets arrested in in the (72:08 - 72:12)
first one a lot of people don't get (72:10 - 72:15)
arrested in this (72:12 - 72:15)
one okay the other complaint I have it (72:15 - 72:20)
this is what drove me crazy I like you (72:18 - 72:23)
guys are like ah the game moves too slow (72:20 - 72:25)
the the text boxes no no no no you know (72:23 - 72:29)
what drove me crazy the weird reason for (72:25 - 72:33)
no reason they needed to introduce Tim's (72:29 - 72:36)
mom and his sister (72:33 - 72:39)
after five years of this game being in (72:36 - 72:41)
development and after also for whatever (72:39 - 72:43)
reason every character needs to remind (72:41 - 72:45)
you that it's been 2 years since the (72:43 - 72:47)
first game which is (72:45 - 72:50)
like we're in chapter three and they're (72:47 - 72:52)
still being like 2 years later like no I (72:50 - 72:56)
get it but ALS also why did we invent my (72:52 - 72:58)
mom and my sister to come to my (72:56 - 73:01)
apartment and hang out (72:58 - 73:03)
like that was not a thing in the first (73:01 - 73:06)
game here's the (73:03 - 73:09)
thing they have a (73:06 - 73:12)
plotline that (73:09 - 73:16)
explains why they would be (73:12 - 73:18)
there but (73:16 - 73:19)
do (73:18 - 73:23)
nothing with it they introduced the (73:19 - 73:24)
conflict (73:23 - 73:27)
they introduce why these two characters (73:24 - 73:30)
should be there and are important and at (73:27 - 73:34)
the end of the game you're (73:30 - 73:40)
like and how are you resolving the (73:34 - 73:44)
conflict you're not you are (73:40 - 73:47)
just leaving it you are they didn't even (73:44 - 73:49)
do that in the movie in the movie his (73:47 - 73:53)
mom is dead I don't even remember I (73:49 - 73:55)
think so I think (73:53 - 73:55)
so and he doesn't have a sister in the (73:56 - 74:01)
movie and I know this is not the movie (73:58 - 74:03)
don't the game tell not the movie but (74:01 - 74:06)
but yeah which which is really clever (74:03 - 74:07)
writing that like there there is a point (74:06 - 74:09)
I had a lot of Hope at that moment I'm (74:07 - 74:10)
like this is going to be good and that (74:09 - 74:14)
hope was smashed upon the Rocks but like (74:10 - 74:16)
why this is such a big deal is in the (74:14 - 74:18)
first game they never mention his sister (74:16 - 74:21)
they never mention his like Mom it was (74:18 - 74:26)
like Dad got dead car accident Mewtwo (74:21 - 74:28)
all that stuff got to find the dad (74:26 - 74:31)
Pikachu is here now Pikachu used to be (74:28 - 74:35)
dad's Pikachu Pikachu can talk nothing (74:31 - 74:37)
like Tim is eight like at least 18 in (74:35 - 74:40)
the first game because he has his own (74:37 - 74:44)
apartment and he's living in Ryme City I (74:40 - 74:47)
think he's like 16 in the first game (74:44 - 74:49)
well kid has money I I think maybe (74:47 - 74:51)
you're right like he's there because of (74:49 - 74:53)
school technically or something but like (74:51 - 74:55)
he's he's he's much older so whether (74:53 - 75:00)
he's 16 or 18 he is now 18 or 20 in the (74:55 - 75:01)
second game because they have to remind (75:00 - 75:04)
you that it's 2 years later why they (75:01 - 75:08)
needed to bring in a a mom and a sister (75:04 - 75:10)
and like they like slightly mentioned (75:08 - 75:13)
divorce and like Harry wanted to divorce (75:10 - 75:15)
her probably to like protect the family (75:13 - 75:18)
I'm assuming but like like when when (75:15 - 75:20)
they asked for me to talk to my mom and (75:18 - 75:22)
sister I was like no I don't want to (75:20 - 75:24)
talk to them there's nothing nothing (75:22 - 75:27)
that they could add any value after 14 (75:24 - 75:29)
hours of the first game like they just (75:27 - 75:32)
didn't exist why do they exist now what (75:29 - 75:36)
what possibility could they possibly add (75:32 - 75:38)
to make this story better that was (75:36 - 75:42)
continuing from the first game (75:38 - 75:44)
also yeah maybe Harry divorced you I'm (75:42 - 75:46)
not sure how this ends but why are we (75:44 - 75:49)
all just happy cheery around my (75:46 - 75:52)
apartment when my father has been (75:49 - 75:55)
missing for like two (75:52 - 75:58)
years and they're both in a good mood (75:55 - 75:59)
that's what drove me crazy mom and (75:58 - 76:03)
sister are both like you won the lottery (75:59 - 76:09)
Tim the whole time oh yeah also I (76:03 - 76:11)
mean I think by chapter 3 you've got a (76:09 - 76:13)
hint that there's something up with the (76:11 - 76:17)
sister and Pikachu and you're like (76:13 - 76:20)
mhm that should pay (76:17 - 76:22)
no that should pay into to something (76:20 - 76:28)
nope nope doesn't it goes 100 to the (76:22 - 76:29)
place that you think it does and then (76:28 - 76:32)
stops abruptly they walk you to the (76:29 - 76:34)
answer and go yep that's what you (76:32 - 76:37)
thought okay how about you get out of (76:34 - 76:40)
this house now and leave them behind (76:37 - 76:43)
cool I'm like why are they there and the (76:40 - 76:48)
entire time I kept waiting for you've (76:43 - 76:51)
introduced very (76:48 - 76:51)
interesting conflict (76:51 - 76:56)
and you've introduced a very interesting (76:54 - 77:01)
thing about the sister this is going to (76:56 - 77:03)
nope not nope it's not going to pay off (77:01 - 77:05)
it is just you're going to walk me to (77:03 - 77:06)
the doorstep and then you're going to (77:05 - 77:08)
leave without a kiss good night you're (77:06 - 77:10)
just going to walk away thanks text me (77:08 - 77:12)
later here's the thing I already know (77:10 - 77:14)
that somebody has probably already typed (77:12 - 77:16)
a novel on YouTube they're like typing (77:14 - 77:18)
it right now if you're if you're (77:16 - 77:19)
watching this on YouTube feel free to (77:18 - 77:22)
like comment subscribe I think that (77:19 - 77:24)
YouTube now has AI so when I say like (77:22 - 77:26)
and comment the little bell actually (77:24 - 77:29)
like visually lights up so let me know (77:26 - 77:30)
if that's actually happening when I say (77:29 - 77:33)
those words anyways I know that the (77:30 - 77:36)
YouTube comment is why are three adults (77:33 - 77:38)
being so critical about a children's (77:36 - 77:39)
game well number one you're watching (77:38 - 77:42)
three adults talk about Pokemon so that (77:39 - 77:44)
that's maybe on you number two is I (77:42 - 77:46)
don't think this game is actually for (77:44 - 77:49)
children in any means (77:46 - 77:53)
because what Greg said earlier you like (77:49 - 77:57)
when I was for modern children yeah it's (77:53 - 78:01)
okay here I I played pong my first video (77:57 - 78:03)
game was pong the literally slowest (78:01 - 78:07)
moving game of all time it is simulated (78:03 - 78:10)
tennis or ping pong take your pick and (78:07 - 78:15)
it moved maybe fif out two seconds to (78:10 - 78:18)
get across the screen every time this (78:15 - 78:19)
game moves too slowly for me it would (78:18 - 78:21)
have moved too slowly for me as a kid (78:19 - 78:24)
and I dealt with worth Gra (78:21 - 78:26)
here's the thing that I hate about like (78:24 - 78:28)
the Pokemon is for kids argument or (78:26 - 78:30)
something cuz I feel like it just (78:28 - 78:32)
doesn't it just like such a boomer (78:30 - 78:35)
mentality because like when I was a (78:32 - 78:38)
kid and I'm obviously I'm a millennial (78:35 - 78:39)
when I say Boomer I don't mean like age (78:38 - 78:41)
I just mean like an an old person way of (78:39 - 78:44)
thinking when I that's whatever when I (78:41 - 78:47)
was a kid I played so many bad games (78:44 - 78:51)
because that's all I had mhm like I (78:47 - 78:54)
would play Sonic over over again because (78:51 - 78:57)
I didn't have any other games and when I (78:54 - 79:00)
got when I was able to borrow a friend's (78:57 - 79:03)
game or we exchanged games doesn't (79:00 - 79:05)
matter what kind of game it was it was a (79:03 - 79:07)
new game to me so I would play the heck (79:05 - 79:09)
out of it I played sports games I played (79:07 - 79:10)
racing games I played basketball games (79:09 - 79:12)
street fight like fighting games I (79:10 - 79:14)
played everything because I was (79:12 - 79:18)
desperate to play anything like I got (79:14 - 79:21)
games twice a year my birthday and (79:18 - 79:23)
Christmas and they weren't good games (79:21 - 79:27)
they were like WCW like 299 in the (79:23 - 79:30)
Walmart clearance bin we can't afford (79:27 - 79:32)
WWF the better games you're getting the (79:30 - 79:36)
WCW games right like I didn't get good (79:32 - 79:40)
games we now live in an age (79:36 - 79:46)
where I can access unlimited free games (79:40 - 79:48)
and a lot of them are very good and some (79:46 - 79:50)
of them might nickel and dime you but (79:48 - 79:52)
like you know what I spent my 20 minutes (79:50 - 79:54)
with this free free game I've now hit (79:52 - 79:56)
the pay wall great let me switch to (79:54 - 80:00)
another free game like (79:56 - 80:03)
steam PlayStation store your iPhone your (80:00 - 80:06)
Android phone you have like to to sit (80:03 - 80:08)
here and say like well this game was (80:06 - 80:11)
made for kids no they would go and find (80:08 - 80:14)
and play something else they would play (80:11 - 80:16)
Minecraft they've been playing Minecraft (80:14 - 80:19)
from the time they left their mother to (80:16 - 80:22)
now they are still playing Minecraft (80:19 - 80:26)
they're not playing this they're just no (80:22 - 80:29)
there there might be some small children (80:26 - 80:31)
maybe the ages of 6 to seven that are (80:29 - 80:33)
like Mom I love Pikachu get me the new (80:31 - 80:35)
detective Pikachu game I want it but (80:33 - 80:37)
like the majority of kids are they're (80:35 - 80:39)
they're not playing this so the question (80:37 - 80:40)
is like who is this game made for who is (80:39 - 80:42)
it for who is it for who who is this (80:40 - 80:44)
game for like even like even if you go (80:42 - 80:46)
up an age of like a 10 to 12y old (80:44 - 80:49)
they're not playing that nope there's no (80:46 - 80:51)
way they're playing that if this came (80:49 - 80:53)
out around the time Diamond and Pearl (80:51 - 80:55)
not not platinum diamond and pearl were (80:53 - 80:57)
out I probably would have been playing (80:55 - 81:00)
it because it's around the same pace and (80:57 - 81:03)
it is Pokemon and it's kind of a story (81:00 - 81:06)
when it was a Pokemon (81:03 - 81:08)
game I was used to Diamond and Pearl (81:06 - 81:09)
being (81:08 - 81:13)
slow this is slow I liked stories I was (81:09 - 81:14)
a big reader I probably would have (81:13 - 81:17)
enjoyed this but at this point with the (81:14 - 81:19)
games that are out there like you said (81:17 - 81:22)
with everything that moves much (81:19 - 81:24)
faster (81:22 - 81:26)
don't know who's enjoying it fully today (81:24 - 81:28)
I just and the thing is the frustrating (81:26 - 81:31)
thing about the game is the overarching (81:28 - 81:35)
story is a good story there are moments (81:31 - 81:38)
of fun and Brilliance there are moments (81:35 - 81:41)
of really funny things that happen and (81:38 - 81:46)
it is bogged down in this slow shell (81:41 - 81:49)
that doesn't respect you very much as an (81:46 - 81:53)
intelligent human being and can't decide (81:49 - 81:57)
who the audience should be (81:53 - 81:57)
and like look people who are like well (81:57 - 82:03)
you just don't like Pokemon look I have (82:02 - 82:05)
been doing this show for I think seven (82:03 - 82:09)
years now I talk about Pokemon for two (82:05 - 82:15)
hours every week I adore this (82:09 - 82:19)
franchise this does not this this is (82:15 - 82:24)
another bad game in a series of them (82:19 - 82:27)
just not hitting the mark in a lot of (82:24 - 82:31)
different areas and it just is like it (82:27 - 82:34)
came out way too late like it's been 5 (82:31 - 82:36)
years in real life only two years in (82:34 - 82:38)
game but still why is it taking you two (82:36 - 82:42)
years to give medals to Your Heroes you (82:38 - 82:45)
don't wait two years to honor people you (82:42 - 82:49)
do that (82:45 - 82:49)
immediately two years for a medal (82:50 - 82:55)
ceremony who cares at that point no why (82:52 - 82:57)
is it why why did they decide two years (82:55 - 82:59)
why is it not two months that that also (82:57 - 83:01)
makes no sense the time they needed (82:59 - 83:04)
College they needed it to be College age (83:01 - 83:06)
they did need to age him for whatever I (83:04 - 83:08)
don't know so like new love interest (83:06 - 83:11)
comes in yeah where he continues to lie (83:08 - 83:14)
to her for the first three (83:11 - 83:14)
chapters believe me that doesn't (83:14 - 83:23)
end um yeah like uh it's it's it's so (83:18 - 83:25)
weird to like again I I streamed I (83:23 - 83:28)
streamed this game nine hours on Friday (83:25 - 83:30)
I was I I tried to warn you about it too (83:28 - 83:32)
you're like I'm going to stream it till (83:30 - 83:34)
it's done I'm like no you're not if okay (83:32 - 83:36)
but here's the thing is like I people (83:34 - 83:37)
would come in they'd be like do you like (83:36 - 83:39)
it I'm like I'm having a great time cuz (83:37 - 83:41)
I am having a good time with it minus (83:39 - 83:43)
all the frustrations and then the (83:41 - 83:44)
obviously the question is like should I (83:43 - 83:46)
pick this up is it worth $50 and they're (83:44 - 83:47)
like no I'm like no and they're like (83:46 - 83:49)
well you just said you like (83:47 - 83:51)
it (83:49 - 83:55)
yes but like if every chapter was the (83:51 - 83:57)
first chapter it would actually probably (83:55 - 84:00)
be a yes for me oh 100% I'd be on board (83:57 - 84:01)
I I would also be on board with the (84:00 - 84:04)
price I'd be like yeah it's Charming for (84:01 - 84:06)
50 bucks sure I mean it's Pokemon priced (84:04 - 84:09)
but it's Charming but they lose the (84:06 - 84:13)
charm unfortunately very quickly so it's (84:09 - 84:15)
like I don't think this game was in (84:13 - 84:17)
development for five years right like I (84:15 - 84:19)
don't think it was I I would assume what (84:17 - 84:22)
happened is they started making the game (84:19 - 84:25)
and then because of Co and because (84:22 - 84:28)
creatures also makes models they do the (84:25 - 84:31)
modeling for pretty much all the other (84:28 - 84:32)
Pokemon (84:31 - 84:35)
games they probably had to stop work on (84:32 - 84:37)
scarlet and violet work on bdsp work on (84:35 - 84:40)
Legends work on whatever asleep I don't (84:37 - 84:41)
actually know who's making the models (84:40 - 84:43)
for sleep right they they probably had (84:41 - 84:46)
to stop and either help game freak or do (84:43 - 84:48)
whatever they needed to do and then come (84:46 - 84:50)
back to this game that's the only (84:48 - 84:53)
explanation why it took 5 years years to (84:50 - 84:58)
make a pretty mediocre game and again I (84:53 - 85:00)
I don't know if it was just like okay (84:58 - 85:01)
like we we this this is going too long (85:00 - 85:03)
we just got to put something out just (85:01 - 85:05)
wrap it up because the first chapter is (85:03 - 85:08)
is genuinely pretty okay like like it (85:05 - 85:10)
felt great it felt satisfying like (85:08 - 85:12)
there's of course there was like some (85:10 - 85:14)
slogs of like running back and forth and (85:12 - 85:16)
stuff but like it's better than nothing (85:14 - 85:18)
like like the first game didn't really (85:16 - 85:21)
have side quest or anything it'd be nice (85:18 - 85:25)
if the side quest gave you something but (85:21 - 85:27)
like what's interesting about the side (85:25 - 85:30)
quest is like you get more story about (85:27 - 85:33)
the world like so the more you do the (85:30 - 85:36)
better the newspaper (85:33 - 85:40)
is but that's it I mean there's just an (85:36 - 85:42)
additional newspaper story for each side (85:40 - 85:44)
quest you complete oh is that what it (85:42 - 85:47)
does yeah cuz when I picked up the side (85:44 - 85:49)
quest with the newspaper for the first (85:47 - 85:50)
time they're like oh there's a crossword (85:49 - 85:53)
puzzle here and I was like oh 10 out of (85:50 - 85:54)
10 game if we're doing a crossw word (85:53 - 85:55)
puzzle right now but then it wasn't (85:54 - 85:57)
actually a cross word puzzle it was just (85:55 - 85:59)
more dialogue and then I never looked at (85:57 - 86:02)
the newspaper again cuz I was I so every (85:59 - 86:04)
side quest you complete adds to the (86:02 - 86:06)
newspaper (86:04 - 86:08)
and as you get through more chapters you (86:06 - 86:11)
learn more about the world because it's (86:08 - 86:12)
not just reading what you did they (86:11 - 86:16)
expound on things so if you're at all (86:12 - 86:19)
interested in how the world around you (86:16 - 86:23)
is sort of working there it's (86:19 - 86:25)
it as that (86:23 - 86:28)
but by the time you get through chapter (86:25 - 86:32)
3 you are the payoff for that is so (86:28 - 86:35)
minor and you really have to care about (86:32 - 86:38)
rhyme City and the game does not make (86:35 - 86:39)
you care about these (86:38 - 86:41)
people (86:39 - 86:45)
um and and this while the additional (86:41 - 86:49)
information is cute it's not (86:45 - 86:52)
necessary it does at one point I think (86:49 - 86:54)
in chapter I think it's chapter 3 it was (86:52 - 86:56)
the longest amount of side quest that I (86:54 - 86:58)
had and so the paper was just this (86:56 - 87:00)
stream of things that I was clicking (86:58 - 87:02)
through and I'm like this is now just (87:00 - 87:05)
wasting my (87:02 - 87:05)
time why (87:05 - 87:10)
why some of the stuff is interesting but (87:08 - 87:12)
Al and some of the interactions with (87:10 - 87:16)
Pikachu are cute but (87:12 - 87:19)
ultimately I'm just wasting my time for (87:16 - 87:22)
fluff that doesn't affect the world I (87:19 - 87:24)
learned more about Ryme City a little (87:22 - 87:26)
bit more about Pikachu which (87:24 - 87:29)
becomes mostly unimportant after chapter (87:26 - 87:34)
4 so cool they also do a thing I hate in (87:29 - 87:36)
video games Final Fantasy 14 does this (87:34 - 87:39)
too and it drives me crazy is they'll do (87:36 - 87:42)
a cut scene and then they'll break away (87:39 - 87:44)
from the cut scene and they'll give you (87:42 - 87:46)
like the smallest amount of manually (87:44 - 87:48)
pressing a text dialogue and then they (87:46 - 87:51)
immediately go back into a cutscene and (87:48 - 87:53)
I hate it (87:51 - 87:54)
and I I know Greg's going to defend (87:53 - 87:56)
Final Fantasy 14 but they do it all the (87:54 - 87:59)
time and it's like I the one defense I (87:56 - 88:02)
have they stopped they don't do it in (87:59 - 88:04)
the last two these last two expansions (88:02 - 88:06)
they really stopped doing that they did (88:04 - 88:08)
that a lot before they did so much in a (88:06 - 88:10)
rorn and I hated it and it was like you (88:08 - 88:12)
could you could literally count the (88:10 - 88:15)
words like like she said 20 different (88:12 - 88:17)
words and that wasn't good enough for (88:15 - 88:21)
the cut scene like literally just reuse (88:17 - 88:23)
the animations and just have her speak (88:21 - 88:25)
those 20 words I don't know how much (88:23 - 88:28)
people are getting paid per word but (88:25 - 88:31)
like why are we why are we 30 second cut (88:28 - 88:35)
scene two sentences of dialogue a minute (88:31 - 88:38)
cut scene just put it all into a cut (88:35 - 88:40)
scene that's that they fixed they fixed (88:38 - 88:43)
that little problem a lot the later (88:40 - 88:45)
expenses I will Adit like a r Mor is (88:43 - 88:46)
just (88:45 - 88:50)
not great um it's fun but it's not their (88:46 - 88:53)
best when you get later that stops a lot (88:50 - 88:54)
really when they're going to go into a (88:53 - 88:57)
cut scene you're in the cut scene and (88:54 - 89:00)
then you go into yeah if it just for a (88:57 - 89:01)
story based game it just kind of takes (89:00 - 89:04)
you out of it yeah of and it's just like (89:01 - 89:06)
you're you're just feeding me story just (89:04 - 89:09)
feed it to me just just give me (89:06 - 89:11)
um yeah (89:09 - 89:15)
I I again I'm having fun with it I think (89:11 - 89:17)
I think to answer the question again if (89:15 - 89:21)
you liked the first one this is probably (89:17 - 89:24)
worth it to you but that's if you paid (89:21 - 89:25)
$40 and you like the first (89:24 - 89:27)
one (89:25 - 89:30)
yes if you liked the first one I'm going (89:27 - 89:31)
to say if you like the first one chances (89:30 - 89:33)
are you're going to be disappointed in (89:31 - 89:35)
this one because it's not I don't think (89:33 - 89:38)
it's as good it's at a higher (89:35 - 89:42)
price which also hurts I think if you (89:38 - 89:44)
liked the first one wait for this to go (89:42 - 89:48)
on Black Friday sale or some other you (89:44 - 89:51)
do not there is nothing pressing about (89:48 - 89:53)
this story there is nothing to get it (89:51 - 89:55)
done before the rest everybody else does (89:53 - 89:57)
The Story Goes exactly where you thought (89:55 - 89:59)
it was going to go it it it is not a (89:57 - 90:02)
highly complex I can't believe the twist (89:59 - 90:05)
at the end you won't believe what number (90:02 - 90:07)
chapter 5 brings none of that happens (90:05 - 90:09)
wait for it to go on sale if you liked (90:07 - 90:11)
the first (90:09 - 90:14)
one there's enough in here that you will (90:11 - 90:18)
find it Charming but it is a it is a (90:14 - 90:20)
bitter pill to swallow at the price (90:18 - 90:22)
point and how long it takes (90:20 - 90:25)
I I I don't think this is a I don't (90:22 - 90:29)
think this is a good enough sequel for (90:25 - 90:31)
people who liked the first one because I (90:29 - 90:32)
played the first one granted I got it (90:31 - 90:35)
for free because I borrowed it from you (90:32 - 90:38)
and I enjoyed it but ultimately I was (90:35 - 90:41)
disappointed at at a lot of the (90:38 - 90:44)
production value in the sequel it just (90:41 - 90:50)
felt it felt inferior to the original (90:44 - 90:52)
game so this is good for people who want (90:50 - 90:55)
to finish the story from the first one (90:52 - 90:58)
yes I'm not sure if it's worth it for (90:55 - 91:00)
anyone who didn't play the first one yes (90:58 - 91:03)
yeah know if you didn't pick up the (91:00 - 91:05)
first (91:03 - 91:08)
one use that same logic that apply to (91:05 - 91:12)
this one also I think a lot of the the (91:08 - 91:14)
plot points were better in the (91:12 - 91:17)
movie Just rewatch the movie yeah (91:14 - 91:19)
rewatch the movie I think it the movie (91:17 - 91:21)
does a really good (91:19 - 91:26)
job yeah yeah um also no amiibo support (91:21 - 91:27)
not that that's like super surprising (91:26 - 91:31)
but they did make a giant P detective (91:27 - 91:33)
Pikachu amiibo which was (91:31 - 91:38)
cool uh that doesn't work or do anything (91:33 - 91:42)
here which I don't remember what the (91:38 - 91:44)
giant Pikachu amiibo did in the first (91:42 - 91:48)
one uh but nothing literally nothing (91:44 - 91:52)
here not even like uh Tim changes his (91:48 - 91:54)
iconic Red Jacket which is a line they (91:52 - 91:58)
use in the game Tim with his iconic Red (91:54 - 92:00)
Jacket yeah not what I think when I (91:58 - 92:03)
think of Tim Goodman but go go off video (92:00 - 92:06)
game tell me how I should feel but like (92:03 - 92:08)
nothing (92:06 - 92:12)
like Zip zero no amiibo support not that (92:08 - 92:14)
like the amiibo support would have (92:12 - 92:17)
changed anyone's thoughts on this game (92:14 - 92:19)
it looks like in the original one when (92:17 - 92:20)
you scanned the amiibo you would get (92:19 - 92:24)
access to all previous Pika prompts so (92:20 - 92:27)
discussions with Detective Pikachu oh (92:24 - 92:30)
okay uh I will say find my final thought (92:27 - 92:32)
here is I did get stuck in the game at (92:30 - 92:35)
the end of chapter 3 there in the corner (92:32 - 92:37)
it tells you what your mission is (92:35 - 92:40)
supposed to be uh and my mission was (92:37 - 92:41)
talk to (92:40 - 92:44)
everyone's uh talk to like every person (92:41 - 92:47)
about their partner Pokemon or whatever (92:44 - 92:50)
right um so there's like the Sab ey the (92:47 - 92:53)
the liard or no sorry the it was like (92:50 - 92:56)
intellian lilan whatever it was it was (92:53 - 92:59)
just like four people and I talked to (92:56 - 93:03)
everyone and I was like what (92:59 - 93:06)
like what what do I need to (93:03 - 93:08)
do and there are some people you just (93:06 - 93:10)
don't need to talk to they have like (93:08 - 93:11)
little blue Bubbles and they're just (93:10 - 93:13)
side quest people and I was like well I (93:11 - 93:14)
guess I'll just talk to all the side (93:13 - 93:17)
quest people as I'm just like knocking (93:14 - 93:19)
out bubbles and I was like I can't (93:17 - 93:20)
progress at all and the top Corner said (93:19 - 93:22)
like talk to all the people and I was (93:20 - 93:24)
like I talk to everyone and then I was (93:22 - 93:25)
like you know what I'll use the little (93:24 - 93:26)
Pikachu (93:25 - 93:29)
hint and the Pikachu obviously Pikachu (93:26 - 93:32)
is not there but like it said like it (93:29 - 93:35)
said let's organize our thoughts (93:32 - 93:38)
together and see where we need to go (93:35 - 93:40)
next and then it just said talk to all (93:38 - 93:43)
the people and it continued just to tell (93:40 - 93:44)
me to talk to all the people and what I (93:43 - 93:47)
actually had to do was go right next to (93:44 - 93:49)
where the people were standing and (93:47 - 93:52)
investigate the crime scene and it never (93:49 - 93:56)
told me not even in the hint that like (93:52 - 93:58)
you're done talking to the (93:56 - 94:01)
people now maybe check around the people (93:58 - 94:03)
which is like in retrospect it's like oh (94:01 - 94:04)
duh like at some point I'm sure at the (94:03 - 94:06)
beginning of the chapter it it said (94:04 - 94:08)
something like that but when your video (94:06 - 94:10)
game in the upper right hand corner says (94:08 - 94:12)
the your current mission is to talk to (94:10 - 94:14)
all the people and I did that it never (94:12 - 94:17)
updated or changed to being like you did (94:14 - 94:19)
indeed talk to all the (94:17 - 94:22)
people it's like this is the hard part (94:19 - 94:24)
of the (94:22 - 94:24)
game just finding out what I should talk (94:25 - 94:29)
to next also one of them is the (94:28 - 94:31)
hamburger shop which has nothing to do (94:29 - 94:33)
with anything you just have to know that (94:31 - 94:36)
you need to like try to go in inside the (94:33 - 94:38)
hamburger shop which you can't go in you (94:36 - 94:40)
just stand at the door and then it gives (94:38 - 94:42)
you a bunch of prompts which is (94:40 - 94:47)
like okay maybe I miss some dialogue but (94:42 - 94:50)
there is in the (94:47 - 94:53)
dialogue one moment where so I knew I (94:50 - 94:54)
had to go check cuz they were like I (94:53 - 94:56)
don't understand blah blah blah blah BL (94:54 - 94:58)
blah and you're like maybe I should (94:56 - 95:00)
check the table next to you what you (94:58 - 95:02)
just said was really (95:00 - 95:05)
[Laughter] (95:02 - 95:07)
weird (95:05 - 95:10)
um yeah it's it's it's a weird (95:07 - 95:13)
game it's a weird game because of what (95:10 - 95:15)
it is who it's marketed towards the (95:13 - 95:17)
price and that there has been nothing (95:15 - 95:23)
detective Pikachu for five years mhm mhm (95:17 - 95:26)
nothing it's (95:23 - 95:30)
so weird it's like a case study of Mis (95:26 - 95:33)
timing all (95:30 - 95:33)
around like even if it was a as even if (95:33 - 95:38)
it was the same game but it came out (95:36 - 95:40)
closer to the movie I bet I bet it would (95:38 - 95:43)
sell significantly better I mean I think (95:40 - 95:46)
I think it I still think it would play (95:43 - 95:48)
incredibly slowly and that would (95:46 - 95:50)
frustrate me but I would be more (95:48 - 95:52)
generous to it because I had better (95:50 - 95:54)
feelings about the franchise at that (95:52 - 95:57)
point it's been 5 years (95:54 - 96:01)
and a rough a rough year of (95:57 - 96:06)
Pokemon so so like the the one rumor I (96:01 - 96:08)
heard is or not rumor but like there was (96:06 - 96:10)
a couple press releases or press Outlets (96:08 - 96:12)
saying like this might not be the last (96:10 - 96:14)
detective Pikachu ever even though it (96:12 - 96:17)
wraps up the story which maybe I could (96:14 - 96:19)
believe I I don't know how well this (96:17 - 96:22)
game is selling I have like the chart (96:19 - 96:24)
that like it it was number one this past (96:22 - 96:27)
week in top 10 in Japan for physical (96:24 - 96:29)
copies I mean its competition was you (96:27 - 96:31)
know Pikmin 4 Pokemon Scarlet Violet (96:29 - 96:34)
Mario Kart Minecraft smash like games (96:31 - 96:35)
that are already selling well or have (96:34 - 96:37)
existed for several years right like (96:35 - 96:40)
it's not surprising that a Pokemon game (96:37 - 96:42)
in Japan jumped to number one for a (96:40 - 96:45)
couple weeks mhm if they were to make (96:42 - 96:48)
any future detective Pikachu games the (96:45 - 96:51)
thing that I think would actually make (96:48 - 96:53)
it stand stand apart and be fun and (96:51 - 96:57)
bring new people in because again if you (96:53 - 96:59)
skipped the first game I'm not sure why (96:57 - 97:01)
you would be buying this game is just to (96:59 - 97:03)
make every chapter like (97:01 - 97:06)
Scooby-Doo just bring me to a new (97:03 - 97:09)
location give me a crime give me a bunch (97:06 - 97:11)
of characters in Pokemon MO mostly (97:09 - 97:14)
Pokemon that make that interesting and (97:11 - 97:17)
just make it like a Scooby-Doo episode (97:14 - 97:21)
of like what do I need to solve here I I (97:17 - 97:24)
struggled to know how I I don't know how (97:21 - 97:26)
they make a sequel after this one in all (97:24 - 97:29)
honesty I do not know how they make a (97:26 - 97:31)
sequel after this (97:29 - 97:36)
one I don't like I just it was very much (97:31 - 97:38)
at the end I'm like and that's the end (97:36 - 97:40)
of this (97:38 - 97:43)
series because I don't know where I (97:40 - 97:45)
don't know how I don't know how they (97:43 - 97:47)
would continue it I literally don't know (97:45 - 97:49)
how they would continue it like I just (97:47 - 97:53)
don't I'm like okay I don't understand (97:49 - 97:55)
what okay we're and we're done this is (97:53 - 97:57)
it this is the done one okay there were (97:55 - 97:59)
two cool (97:57 - 97:59)
done uh yeah the first chapter is really (98:01 - 98:04)
good (98:03 - 98:07)
though until you have to ride the growth (98:04 - 98:10)
I'm sorry that is just too slow it's so (98:07 - 98:12)
slow I didn't really I didn't mind the (98:10 - 98:14)
Growlithe I like the Growlithe more than (98:12 - 98:15)
the (98:14 - 98:19)
dantan they're both slow yeah maybe it (98:15 - 98:20)
was my Placebo I felt like the growth (98:19 - 98:24)
was much faster mm mm no I mean the (98:20 - 98:27)
growth went went not slow when you were (98:24 - 98:29)
just walking around and running around (98:27 - 98:31)
but when you had to follow the scent oh (98:29 - 98:33)
see I just ran and then like scented (98:31 - 98:34)
like (98:33 - 98:37)
every like I just I just would pick it I (98:34 - 98:39)
would run see where the scent is going (98:37 - 98:41)
go to the end of the level double check (98:39 - 98:43)
the scent was still there then go (98:41 - 98:44)
through the (98:43 - 98:46)
door so I was I was speeding around I (98:44 - 98:49)
never held it down for the whole scent I (98:46 - 98:52)
was I should have done that I was ta I (98:49 - 98:54)
was tactical sniffing I did that a (98:52 - 98:55)
couple of times you'll you'll need (98:54 - 98:58)
you'll need those skills in chapter 5 I (98:55 - 99:02)
was I was tactical sniffing um well okay (98:58 - 99:03)
