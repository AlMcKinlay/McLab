glory 2 it's super effective i know (1:55 - 1:59)
those brits (1:57 - 2:02)
cancelled that's very weird in the (1:59 - 2:04)
podcast space of like (2:02 - 2:05)
this probably applies to like youtubers (2:04 - 2:07)
and other content creators too but like (2:05 - 2:09)
just shows existing (2:07 - 2:12)
for 10 15 years and then yeah one day (2:09 - 2:13)
they (2:12 - 2:15)
they're done i think with answering me (2:13 - 2:17)
this it's been obvious for probably the (2:15 - 2:17)
past (2:17 - 2:19)
five years that they haven't wanted to (2:17 - 2:20)
do it anymore (2:19 - 2:22)
and then they were just like you know (2:20 - 2:24)
what it's episode 400. (2:22 - 2:26)
we really don't want to do this anymore (2:24 - 2:28)
let's just go out on an even number (2:26 - 2:31)
i mean i'm i support that that is valid (2:28 - 2:32)
i was super in a night vale until they (2:31 - 2:34)
started doing those live podcasts and (2:32 - 2:35)
then i was like (2:34 - 2:38)
instantly out uh live (2:35 - 2:40)
you mean would they record their live (2:38 - 2:42)
programs yeah so they would do like (2:40 - 2:42)
their (2:42 - 2:44)
stories and then there they got to like (2:42 - 2:46)
episode like 60 and they did one in (2:44 - 2:47)
front of an audience (2:46 - 2:49)
and like having the audience laugh at (2:47 - 2:51)
like that's okay that's right (2:49 - 2:53)
humor that's what killed nightvale for (2:51 - 2:55)
me too as i watched a video of a live (2:53 - 2:56)
performance and (2:55 - 2:58)
it's like all the people in the audience (2:56 - 3:00)
the the way that i always put it (2:58 - 3:03)
it's like they the audience were (3:00 - 3:03)
thinking (3:03 - 3:06)
well i'm supposed to laugh at this so (3:03 - 3:07)
let me laugh (3:06 - 3:10)
out loud so people know that i get the (3:07 - 3:10)
joke (3:10 - 3:14)
too i never got just (3:10 - 3:16)
dumb i never got past night vale episode (3:14 - 3:17)
three (3:16 - 3:20)
i could yeah i listened to the first ten (3:17 - 3:22)
episodes probably like (3:20 - 3:23)
uh four or five times because i like a (3:22 - 3:25)
lot of people (3:23 - 3:26)
because a lot of my friends at the time (3:25 - 3:28)
started it as well so (3:26 - 3:31)
um and then yeah once we get to live (3:28 - 3:31)
because (3:31 - 3:33)
like when you're listening to night vale (3:31 - 3:35)
you're never actually laughing out loud (3:33 - 3:37)
correct it was just like oh that's (3:35 - 3:39)
clever (3:37 - 3:40)
like oh very but then when you're (3:39 - 3:42)
hearing people laugh at the dry humor (3:40 - 3:43)
you're like (3:42 - 3:47)
it's not that funny exactly well it's (3:43 - 3:47)
not (3:47 - 3:50)
it's not laugh out loud funny it's like (3:47 - 3:53)
think about it and get an internal (3:50 - 3:54)
chuckle (3:53 - 3:55)
i just couldn't get past the (3:54 - 3:57)
affectations like (3:55 - 3:59)
it just their performance hey hey you (3:57 - 4:01)
you can't talk about affectations on (3:59 - 4:02)
this program (4:01 - 4:05)
i can because they're no this is all (4:02 - 4:06)
that's all we are (4:05 - 4:08)
they're the way they performed that (4:06 - 4:11)
character (4:08 - 4:11)
bothered me deeply and i could never get (4:11 - 4:15)
past it well it's not like you went to (4:14 - 4:17)
acting school greg come on it's not (4:15 - 4:19)

i can tell you that uh we got (4:33 - 4:40)
actually quite a bit of news today a lot (4:37 - 4:42)
of it revolves around bdoof but i think (4:40 - 4:43)
we'll save that part because there was a (4:42 - 4:43)
lot of (4:43 - 4:47)
b doof related things and uh whoo that's (4:43 - 4:48)
like both good and bad (4:47 - 4:51)
uh there's i mean it was one joke (4:48 - 4:55)
and they milked that joke for everything (4:51 - 4:56)
they could (4:55 - 4:59)
and i have some ratings to give out (4:56 - 5:02)
and yeah i mean it was okay (4:59 - 5:04)
ah so we'll we'll we'll get to the b do (5:02 - 5:06)
stuff (5:04 - 5:07)
uh let's start off with the pokemon (5:06 - 5:09)
masters news uh because we haven't (5:07 - 5:10)
talked about masters in a hot minute (5:09 - 5:12)

kakui and the mass royale (5:21 - 5:27)
in the same sink pear party there's an (5:24 - 5:28)
obvious bug (5:27 - 5:31)
there's an obvious obvious bug uh and (5:28 - 5:32)
then they said (5:31 - 5:34)
well you know a lot of people have been (5:32 - 5:35)
experiencing this (5:34 - 5:38)
well we're gonna have to get back to you (5:35 - 5:40)
it doesn't make any sense (5:38 - 5:42)
yeah because i mean i haven't they're (5:40 - 5:43)
very different characters they're very (5:42 - 5:44)
different characters (5:43 - 5:46)
they don't even know each other as far (5:44 - 5:47)
as i can tell like i (5:46 - 5:48)
i don't even know when they would have (5:47 - 5:51)
met so there's that (5:48 - 5:53)
also i haven't pulled mascara out i did (5:51 - 5:54)
i spent all my gems in pulling (5:53 - 5:58)
kiawah because i wanted the best (5:54 - 6:01)
alolan pokemon alolan marowak and i (5:58 - 6:02)
finally got it (6:01 - 6:04)
wait you like alolan merriweath yeah who (6:02 - 6:08)
doesn't like a little (6:04 - 6:08)
shirt that i've worn on community today (6:08 - 6:13)
while you were there (6:10 - 6:13)
another is this usually i feel like i (6:13 - 6:18)
know all your favorite pokemon i didn't (6:16 - 6:21)
know marowak was one (6:18 - 6:24)
no no regular marowak is just (6:21 - 6:27)
ground normal garbage alolan marijuana (6:24 - 6:32)
lowland marowak is outstanding (6:27 - 6:32)
uh so you didn't pull the master out i (6:33 - 6:36)
didn't (6:36 - 6:39)
i pulled kia away and nobody else (6:36 - 6:40)
because i my gems (6:39 - 6:44)
my gem in flux is pitifully slow (6:40 - 6:46)
well we are eventually getting to the (6:44 - 6:48)
two year anniversary was that like a (6:46 - 6:49)
month or two away (6:48 - 6:52)
yeah yeah uh so the the news here is (6:49 - 6:56)
emmett and ingo for reasons (6:52 - 6:56)
so wait for the two-year anniversary i (6:57 - 7:04)
can't say this joke (6:59 - 7:04)
do you think hold on i i know there were (7:04 - 7:08)
i know (7:07 - 7:11)
this is off topic do you think that (7:08 - 7:14)
no probably not because we know that (7:11 - 7:16)
we know that dynamics is coming yeah (7:14 - 7:18)
yeah my thoughts are everywhere we know (7:16 - 7:19)
that dynamaxx is coming to pokemon (7:18 - 7:20)
masters they (7:19 - 7:22)
said that yeah um and i think they said (7:20 - 7:23)
by the two-year anniversary (7:22 - 7:27)
yes and we have leon and we have nessa (7:23 - 7:30)
and we have who's the other one (7:27 - 7:33)
marley mark we have (7:30 - 7:36)
yeah we have marnie we have (7:33 - 7:39)
nessa we have leon (7:36 - 7:41)
pierce but piers doesn't die to max (7:39 - 7:44)
pierce has an imax do we have reihan (7:41 - 7:47)
yeah we have reihan raihan (7:44 - 7:50)
and he is doraledon yep so that's g max (7:47 - 7:51)
leon has (7:50 - 7:54)
charizard that's g max yup uh marnie is (7:51 - 7:59)
more peco so no no but could die to max (7:54 - 8:03)
has dreadna yeah so gmax (7:59 - 8:06)
could be gmax they've done (8:03 - 8:09)
such a good job in the last like (8:06 - 8:11)
year and a half of lining events up (8:09 - 8:13)
mm-hmm and obviously (8:11 - 8:14)
gigantomax will eventually come to (8:13 - 8:16)
masters even though like (8:14 - 8:18)
we are already fighting big pokemon in (8:16 - 8:19)
like a raid battle sense (8:18 - 8:21)
but i would i would be curious of (8:19 - 8:23)
gigantomax like if you want (8:21 - 8:27)
gigantivex charizard if they would (8:23 - 8:29)
they need more like ex rate stuff and (8:27 - 8:31)
they know that ex for aids like we know (8:29 - 8:32)
that that's coming back we talked about (8:31 - 8:33)
that a week ago (8:32 - 8:34)
so what are you switching now you're (8:33 - 8:36)
switching to go yeah i just wonder if (8:34 - 8:38)
they're gonna line the two up (8:36 - 8:40)
oh i see so you're saying we're gonna (8:38 - 8:41)
because we know when gigantomax is (8:40 - 8:42)
coming we know that well (8:41 - 8:44)
i guess we're assuming it's coming for (8:42 - 8:45)
the two year but i swear they said that (8:44 - 8:46)
at one point (8:45 - 8:49)
i don't know that i remember them saying (8:46 - 8:52)
that specifically but i think they've (8:49 - 8:55)
heavily implied that there's going to be (8:52 - 8:56)
a (8:55 - 8:58)
that it's going to come at the two-year (8:56 - 8:59)
anniversary (8:58 - 9:02)
yeah uh (8:59 - 9:07)
but they normally in go do something big (9:02 - 9:09)
for like there's usually one big (9:07 - 9:11)
mechanic they do and go like last year (9:09 - 9:11)
was megas (9:11 - 9:13)
was it last year i can't remember when (9:11 - 9:15)
people were complaining (9:13 - 9:19)
it was last year um (9:15 - 9:23)
anyways uh for characters we never (9:19 - 9:24)
thought would come to masters ingo (9:23 - 9:27)
and excadrill and emmett and archaeops (9:24 - 9:28)
are coming to (9:27 - 9:31)
are here will knows who they are they're (9:28 - 9:33)
the battle subway bosses from the unova (9:31 - 9:34)
region (9:33 - 9:37)
correct will what's your hot take on (9:34 - 9:39)
these two dudes (9:37 - 9:41)
i mean that's a unique feature of the (9:39 - 9:43)
black and white games that wasn't (9:41 - 9:44)
carried forward (9:43 - 9:46)
but they're just you know you battle (9:44 - 9:48)
your way through the battle subway and (9:46 - 9:52)
finally get to the conductors (9:48 - 9:56)
what more is there to say spoiler alert (9:52 - 9:59)
they're building a battle subway in (9:56 - 10:01)
paizo (9:59 - 10:03)
passive what are they really that's (10:01 - 10:04)
that's their storyline yeah they want to (10:03 - 10:06)
build a battle subway (10:04 - 10:08)
are there enough locations to travel to (10:06 - 10:09)
to require a (10:08 - 10:12)
a subway i'm not going to spoil the (10:09 - 10:14)
story of what they find (10:12 - 10:17)
and how they make their thing remember (10:14 - 10:18)
that i'm (10:17 - 10:20)
you could only get to by riding the (10:18 - 10:22)
train and it was like the train turn (10:20 - 10:23)
around town (10:22 - 10:26)
yeah you know just fantastic you know (10:23 - 10:27)
i'm waiting for the character that gets (10:26 - 10:31)
will hardcore in the masters this (10:27 - 10:34)
we're already two years past any (10:31 - 10:38)
possibility i i i just i can't (10:34 - 10:41)
my only response to gotcha games (10:38 - 10:45)
is to continually ask all of you people (10:41 - 10:48)
please let the industry know that we (10:45 - 10:49)
don't want gotcha games (10:48 - 10:52)
by stop playing them red is the only way (10:49 - 10:53)
they will learn (10:52 - 10:56)
is if you all stop playing gotcha games (10:53 - 10:59)
they will stop making gotcha games (10:56 - 11:01)
yeah but everyone's playing [ __ ] impact (10:59 - 11:02)
at this point everything (11:01 - 11:05)
i stopped playing yeah yeah i i had to (11:02 - 11:06)
stop i didn't (11:05 - 11:08)
get very far into it uh so fyi there are (11:06 - 11:09)
a lot of people i know that were (11:08 - 11:12)
confused as to why ingo and emmett (11:09 - 11:15)
have ex gadrill and archeops (11:12 - 11:17)
uh they i'm assuming those people never (11:15 - 11:18)
battled (11:17 - 11:20)
like these like those aren't their (11:18 - 11:22)
pokemon they did well they it's their (11:20 - 11:23)
pokemon on the 49th (11:22 - 11:25)
consecutive battle it's not what they (11:23 - 11:27)
have the first time (11:25 - 11:31)
so if you only got to 20 uh (11:27 - 11:34)
you never you never saw it and it's also (11:31 - 11:37)
only through the multi trains like it's (11:34 - 11:39)
a very specific (11:37 - 11:42)
like it happened in the second team set (11:39 - 11:42)
but they do (11:42 - 11:45)
have them but also when has pokemon (11:42 - 11:46)
masters (11:45 - 11:49)
ever hewn so close to what pokemons (11:46 - 11:51)
would be related with anything they do (11:49 - 11:53)
they do they do they do the only time (11:51 - 11:55)
they don't is when it's the (11:53 - 11:57)
uh the alternate clothing what is that (11:55 - 11:58)
called um (11:57 - 12:01)
well sigma sigma suits is what strays (11:58 - 12:03)
away from the (12:01 - 12:06)
main series lore uh segment suits and (12:03 - 12:08)
um i feel like i've heard you guys (12:06 - 12:09)
complain about (12:08 - 12:12)
shouldn't this person have shown up with (12:09 - 12:14)
this pokemon but they actually should (12:12 - 12:15)
didn't do it (12:14 - 12:16)
well how are we gonna have eight (12:15 - 12:18)
charizards in the game when there's so (12:16 - 12:20)
many people that are so identified with (12:18 - 12:21)
charizard yeah but the charizards are (12:20 - 12:22)
different (12:21 - 12:26)
ones it's gonna there are things like (12:22 - 12:26)
don (12:26 - 12:29)
is here with turtwig and you know don (12:26 - 12:30)
had piplup in the anime (12:29 - 12:33)
hello hello so there's i mean there are (12:30 - 12:35)
things like that because (12:33 - 12:39)
they gave barry piplup so (12:35 - 12:40)
yeah but what else were they going to (12:39 - 12:42)
give barry come on i know so i mean (12:40 - 12:46)
there there are there are s (12:42 - 12:48)
they stray from people's expectations (12:46 - 12:50)
but usually there is (12:48 - 12:52)
an underlying reason unless it's a sigma (12:50 - 12:53)
suit (12:52 - 12:57)
or a holiday specific (12:53 - 13:00)
pair you know but after this game almost (12:57 - 13:02)
existing for two years it's kind of nice (13:00 - 13:03)
that the (13:02 - 13:06)
cigna suits stray away from that because (13:03 - 13:06)
otherwise (13:06 - 13:08)
you wouldn't get you wouldn't ever see (13:06 - 13:11)
specific pokemon right (13:08 - 13:12)
because if you're only limiting yourself (13:11 - 13:14)
to like gym leaders (13:12 - 13:17)
like they run out of pokemon relatively (13:14 - 13:18)
quickly (13:17 - 13:20)
i mean they have a lot of battle (13:18 - 13:22)
frontier battle subways and battle (13:20 - 13:24)
towers and battle manor (13:22 - 13:27)
they have a lot of people to pull from (13:24 - 13:28)
they're not going to run out anytime (13:27 - 13:29)
soon yeah (13:28 - 13:31)
i think what's really interesting though (13:29 - 13:33)
about including emmett and ingo (13:31 - 13:36)
is there are people who were even like (13:33 - 13:39)
hardcore fans and players of (13:36 - 13:42)
black and white black and white too who (13:39 - 13:44)
even played extensive post game (13:42 - 13:46)
who never encountered emmett and ningo (13:44 - 13:47)
yeah so in (13:46 - 13:50)
black white black black 2 white 2 you do (13:47 - 13:51)
have to fight them once (13:50 - 13:54)
they're outside of the subway and they (13:51 - 13:55)
you have to (13:54 - 13:57)
do a double battle with them with your (13:55 - 13:58)
um (13:57 - 14:01)
with bianca i think not bianca (13:58 - 14:04)
uh hugh hugh yeah so you and hugh have (14:01 - 14:05)
to battle them once (14:04 - 14:07)
and then you can just completely ignore (14:05 - 14:08)
them but in the first one (14:07 - 14:10)
in first black and white you could just (14:08 - 14:12)
never go into the subway and never see (14:10 - 14:12)
them (14:12 - 14:16)
and never see them uh the (14:12 - 14:19)
i i i did hear i heard the same (14:16 - 14:21)
complaint you heard greg which is like (14:19 - 14:23)
why do they have these pokemon we talked (14:21 - 14:24)
about that (14:23 - 14:26)
the other thing is like i saw people (14:24 - 14:28)
were upset they were like fair scout (14:26 - 14:30)
but when they announced these characters (14:28 - 14:32)
in japan they were trending on twitter (14:30 - 14:34)
like these are two super popular (14:32 - 14:35)
characters in japan (14:34 - 14:38)
and so like even though like i know a (14:35 - 14:39)
bunch of people being like i'm skipping (14:38 - 14:40)
these i'm not going to fair scout for (14:39 - 14:42)
them it's like that's fine (14:40 - 14:45)
yeah japan will gladly pay for (14:42 - 14:46)
everything they need to pay in facebook (14:45 - 14:49)
they have a lot they have a lot (14:46 - 14:51)
they have two men are too many banners (14:49 - 14:52)
running right now (14:51 - 14:56)
anyways so it's fine if you skip yeah (14:52 - 14:57)
and it's totally fine to skip and i (14:56 - 14:59)
think i don't know why (14:57 - 15:01)
people feel they need to pull on every (14:59 - 15:04)
new banner and (15:01 - 15:04)
because polling is fun i get it pulling (15:05 - 15:09)
is fun it's it is the nature of gotcha (15:06 - 15:10)
games where they make it (15:09 - 15:12)
like these are new and exciting and you (15:10 - 15:13)
get to pull these these (15:12 - 15:16)
new and exciting potentially high (15:13 - 15:17)
quality (15:16 - 15:20)
sink pairs uh and you know they make a (15:17 - 15:21)
big deal out of them and they get (15:20 - 15:23)
introduced and their stories around them (15:21 - 15:24)
and also (15:23 - 15:27)
in their own storyline if you have them (15:24 - 15:28)
you get better rewards (15:27 - 15:30)
from that storyline so there's like (15:28 - 15:32)
multiple layers as to (15:30 - 15:35)
why you want to pull on that banner (15:32 - 15:37)
because like in their storyline they (15:35 - 15:39)
give a 1.6 times (15:37 - 15:42)
boost to getting the tickets right right (15:39 - 15:45)
as a reward and nobody else gives you (15:42 - 15:46)
that much so (15:45 - 15:48)
even having just one of them increases (15:46 - 15:50)
the amount of tickets you get (15:48 - 15:54)
from that um so like (15:50 - 15:57)
it's built into the gain economy to make (15:54 - 15:59)
you want to pull on them but (15:57 - 16:02)
as a gotcha game player resists the urge (15:59 - 16:03)
you don't (16:02 - 16:06)
need it you will get even if you have (16:03 - 16:07)
the (16:06 - 16:10)
1.4 if you line everybody up who has it (16:07 - 16:12)
you will get so many tickets you run out (16:10 - 16:14)
of the top tier rewards (16:12 - 16:16)
anyways if you do it every day and do 10 (16:14 - 16:17)
of them with your (16:16 - 16:19)
tickets and stamina that's the only (16:17 - 16:21)
thing you do you will have (16:19 - 16:22)
more than enough to buy everything out (16:21 - 16:24)
of the item shop (16:22 - 16:25)
i think it's cool they added these two (16:24 - 16:27)
characters though even if you don't like (16:25 - 16:29)
them like it's cool that (16:27 - 16:32)
the i feel like every time they add a (16:29 - 16:34)
not like a character that people forget (16:32 - 16:34)
about (16:34 - 16:38)
like bingo and emmett we get one step (16:34 - 16:41)
closer to mir b and ludacola (16:38 - 16:44)
every i will pay (16:41 - 16:47)
potential money to pull mirror being (16:44 - 16:48)
ludicolo you have (16:47 - 16:51)
no idea how much i want mirror b (16:48 - 16:55)
i love mirror b so much i (16:51 - 16:57)
i have gone on record many times not (16:55 - 16:59)
liking gale darkness or coliseum but (16:57 - 17:01)
there's two things about those games (16:59 - 17:01)
that (17:01 - 17:03)
are huge bangers number one the music (17:01 - 17:04)
the music (17:03 - 17:06)
is incredible the music in those games (17:04 - 17:07)
out but (17:06 - 17:09)
easily the best feature number two is (17:07 - 17:10)
just mere be (17:09 - 17:13)
in general as a character yes (17:10 - 17:17)
top two things of those games (17:13 - 17:19)
those games are brilliant so whatever (17:17 - 17:20)
you're such (17:19 - 17:21)
you're just such a hater i can't even (17:20 - 17:23)
stand it (17:21 - 17:25)
but mirror b is a great thing i think (17:23 - 17:27)
the compliments of the game i will (17:25 - 17:30)
i they've never released the soundtrack (17:27 - 17:32)
for those here have they (17:30 - 17:34)
i wonder if there's i wonder if they did (17:32 - 17:36)
release them in japan i don't think they (17:34 - 17:37)
did i don't think they did (17:36 - 17:39)
we need we still don't have sword and (17:37 - 17:40)
chill soundtrack either (17:39 - 17:42)
i know we need braxton berks to make (17:40 - 17:46)
remake a jazz band version of all those (17:42 - 17:48)
okay songs there's your pokemon masters (17:46 - 17:51)
minute uh i'm sure let's start (17:48 - 17:53)
i'm sure we'll start talking about more (17:51 - 17:55)
closer to closer to as they release more (17:53 - 17:57)
things (17:55 - 18:00)
i'm sure i'm just hoping for a real good (17:57 - 18:00)
gem (18:00 - 18:03)
sale that's what i i mean (18:00 - 18:06)
it if if mirror b is coming in the two (18:03 - 18:08)
year anniversary i will also hope for a (18:06 - 18:10)
good gem sale (18:08 - 18:14)
uh this is off pokemon.com uh uh (18:10 - 18:17)
they have announced series 10 (18:14 - 18:18)
for competitive play here starting (18:17 - 18:20)
august 1st and that will go for three (18:18 - 18:22)
months (18:20 - 18:25)
for pokemon sword and shield uh as (18:22 - 18:27)
previously seen in ranked series eight (18:25 - 18:29)
trainers could include one restricted (18:27 - 18:31)
pokemon from the list (18:29 - 18:33)
of their uh one restricted pokemon (18:31 - 18:35)
listed below for their battle team (18:33 - 18:37)
uh this is different than gs cup which (18:35 - 18:40)
people thought was gonna be series 10 (18:37 - 18:43)
and then the twist to series 10 (18:40 - 18:45)
is that you will not be allowed to (18:43 - 18:48)
dynamics (18:45 - 18:48)
so the restricted pokemon are normally (18:48 - 18:53)
box pokemon (18:51 - 18:54)
now i get this all the time when i'm (18:53 - 18:56)
doing competitive they're like wow (18:54 - 18:59)
there's a lot of legendaries uh and it (18:56 - 19:01)
seems unfair (18:59 - 19:03)
it's not there are legendaries that are (19:01 - 19:05)
just straight up bad like savalai (19:03 - 19:09)
and type null and cosmog (19:05 - 19:11)
just because the pokemon's legendary (19:09 - 19:12)
doesn't mean by default it's (19:11 - 19:13)
automatically good (19:12 - 19:17)
um but the box legends (19:13 - 19:20)
uh which is the probably the easiest way (19:17 - 19:21)
to classify them (19:20 - 19:23)
the you're allowed to have one on your (19:21 - 19:25)
team so that would be mewtwo (19:23 - 19:28)
lugia ho-oh kyogre groudon spoiler (19:25 - 19:30)
kyogre groudon are some of the best (19:28 - 19:33)
uh rayquaza dialga palkia guillotina (19:30 - 19:34)
restaurant zekrom (19:33 - 19:36)
spoiler giratina is probably one of the (19:34 - 19:37)
worst (19:36 - 19:41)
uh kirum xerneas evital zygarde cosmo (19:37 - 19:43)
cosmo (19:41 - 19:43)
don't have to asterix that (19:43 - 19:50)
solgaleo lunala necrozma (19:47 - 19:52)
zashi and zamazenta spoilers zamasunt is (19:50 - 19:53)
very bad (19:52 - 19:56)
uh eternitus and calarex (19:53 - 19:58)
with calorics that would also be (19:56 - 20:00)
caloric's riding (19:58 - 20:03)
spectre and glass tree so shadow rider (20:00 - 20:05)
or ice rider (20:03 - 20:07)
that being said you could have calorics (20:05 - 20:08)
on (20:07 - 20:11)
spectrier and you could still have a (20:08 - 20:12)
glass gear on your team (20:11 - 20:14)
you just can't have calorics writing (20:12 - 20:16)
both (20:14 - 20:19)
um is zernia still really good or is (20:16 - 20:20)
ernest (20:19 - 20:24)
so zernius was awful in dynamaxx format (20:20 - 20:26)
which is really funny because everyone (20:24 - 20:28)
thought dynamaxx zernigs would be (20:26 - 20:31)
unstoppable uh but it just didn't work (20:28 - 20:33)
out that way so xernia should be good (20:31 - 20:34)
again (20:33 - 20:36)
now that there's no dynamics now going (20:34 - 20:37)
back to the earlier thing where they did (20:36 - 20:40)
mention gs cup gs cup was like the end (20:37 - 20:42)
of ultrasound ultra moon (20:40 - 20:43)
uh where you could have two legendary (20:42 - 20:46)
pokemon or sorry two box legends so you (20:43 - 20:48)
would see a lot of people running kyogre (20:46 - 20:50)
and groudon or kyogre and rayquaza or (20:48 - 20:55)
groudon rayquaza um or xerneas (20:50 - 20:58)
groudon usually groudon and kyger was (20:55 - 20:59)
somewhere in that combination because (20:58 - 21:01)
they control weather very well (20:59 - 21:05)
so not that and then we (21:01 - 21:08)
i just want to mention this because (21:05 - 21:11)
they were because people are silly (21:08 - 21:12)
they're like oh they finally realized (21:11 - 21:14)
dynamics was bad (21:12 - 21:16)
no that's not what they're doing they (21:14 - 21:17)
did this in ultrasound ultramoon where (21:16 - 21:18)
they (21:17 - 21:19)
they did a whole format where they were (21:18 - 21:21)
like no z moves and then they did a (21:19 - 21:23)
whole format where they were like no (21:21 - 21:24)
megas (21:23 - 21:25)
and then they did a whole format where (21:24 - 21:28)
they were like you could use both (21:25 - 21:33)
uh fyi this is called data collection (21:28 - 21:35)
and you're doing it for them for free (21:33 - 21:36)
yeah (21:35 - 21:38)
um you know if you're not super in (21:36 - 21:39)
competitive (21:38 - 21:40)
and we said we've seen these people we (21:39 - 21:42)
talk about these people all the time (21:40 - 21:43)
where they're like wow drug dog (21:42 - 21:46)
set up stealth rock it's so broken like (21:43 - 21:47)
we see these kind of like these people (21:46 - 21:48)
are not in competitive they think (21:47 - 21:50)
they're in a competitive they complain (21:48 - 21:51)
about the metagame they don't play the (21:50 - 21:51)
manda game (21:51 - 21:53)
there are lots of things that were (21:51 - 21:55)
changed um (21:53 - 21:58)
that like for example mamo swine had (21:55 - 21:58)
peck (21:58 - 22:01)
you could prior to gen 8 you could use (21:58 - 22:03)
peck on mamo swine (22:01 - 22:05)
no one ever did that because it was a (22:03 - 22:07)
bad move on mamo swine in (22:05 - 22:10)
gen 7 and gen 6 and gen 5. do you know (22:07 - 22:12)
why they got rid of peck (22:10 - 22:14)
because max airstream mamo swine would (22:12 - 22:15)
have been (22:14 - 22:19)
really good yeah man of swine dynamixing (22:15 - 22:20)
and then (22:19 - 22:22)
setting up airstream for speed control (22:20 - 22:23)
is incredibly (22:22 - 22:26)
powerful yeah so they're very they're (22:23 - 22:27)
and (22:26 - 22:28)
why did they get rid of that that would (22:27 - 22:30)
have been awesome i love mammoths (22:28 - 22:30)
because (22:30 - 22:34)
mamo swine can never be king (22:30 - 22:36)
be careful what you ask for mammal (22:34 - 22:38)
shrine is one of my favorites (22:36 - 22:41)
so dynamite's fourth favorite it is (22:38 - 22:44)
[Music] (22:41 - 22:44)
so dynamics was really good to get (22:44 - 22:48)
around things like fake out (22:46 - 22:50)
um to get around things like accuracy (22:48 - 22:51)
evasion (22:50 - 22:53)
um you know dynamics moves hit dynamax (22:51 - 22:56)
also takes a move like dazzling gleam (22:53 - 22:57)
and instead of making it a double target (22:56 - 22:59)
it makes it a single target (22:57 - 23:01)
so when you know a pokemon dynamax's you (22:59 - 23:02)
know they're stuck in single target they (23:01 - 23:03)
can only pick one (23:02 - 23:06)
so there's a lot of structure issues (23:03 - 23:07)
that dynamics (23:06 - 23:11)
does very well but now without dynamax (23:07 - 23:13)
you're going to see a lot more fake out (23:11 - 23:15)
um (23:13 - 23:19)
and you are going to see ershifu (23:15 - 23:22)
and no they did not ban urshifu or she (23:19 - 23:25)
i don't know why they would they clearly (23:22 - 23:26)
this is the thing (23:25 - 23:30)
is they they it's their game they can (23:26 - 23:31)
change their po (23:30 - 23:32)
they have changed their pokemon they (23:31 - 23:34)
have changed their moves they have (23:32 - 23:35)
changed stats (23:34 - 23:37)
they have like nerfed pokemon before (23:35 - 23:39)
talonflame was very very good in gen (23:37 - 23:39)
five (23:39 - 23:41)
and then they were like whoa gale wing's (23:39 - 23:42)
ability is way too strong we need to (23:41 - 23:44)
change this in gen six yeah (23:42 - 23:47)
boom so i don't see (23:44 - 23:50)
third gale wings yeah so (23:47 - 23:53)
uh urshi fu being very good uh because (23:50 - 23:55)
it's ability is unseen fist (23:53 - 23:56)
so it means that you cannot protect in (23:55 - 23:58)
front of hershifu (23:56 - 24:00)
so you have situations now or you will (23:58 - 24:02)
in series 10 where they lead urshifu (24:00 - 24:05)
and they lead somebody that has fake out (24:02 - 24:07)
and you can't (24:05 - 24:08)
protect against the fake out because (24:07 - 24:10)
urshifu will just break through protect (24:08 - 24:14)
and you can't dynamax max guard uh (24:10 - 24:16)
because (24:14 - 24:19)
you can't dynamics you can't dynamics so (24:16 - 24:22)
this will lead to really interesting (24:19 - 24:25)
situations and it should make the format (24:22 - 24:28)
very different than what we saw (24:25 - 24:30)
at the end of series seven with a lot of (24:28 - 24:31)
kyogre a lot of groudon a lot of (24:30 - 24:32)
rayquaza (24:31 - 24:36)
megas um i don't know if it'll like (24:32 - 24:40)
i don't know if it'll be good or bad uh (24:36 - 24:43)
zashian is here now urshifu is here now (24:40 - 24:46)
both calorixes are here the ice rider (24:43 - 24:48)
shadow rider you can still use the (24:46 - 24:49)
regular glass rear (24:48 - 24:52)
urshifu is here so there's a lot of new (24:49 - 24:52)
pokemon (24:52 - 24:55)
that really dictate what other pokemon (24:52 - 24:56)
you can use (24:55 - 24:57)
that being said the best pokemon in the (24:56 - 24:59)
format is still and always will be or (24:57 - 25:02)
incineroar which is not a legendary (24:59 - 25:03)
pokemon (25:02 - 25:05)
uh but a very very good pokemon oh and (25:03 - 25:06)
we still have eloquent we have elokie we (25:05 - 25:08)
have reggie drago (25:06 - 25:12)
um alakia has been very very dominant (25:08 - 25:16)
uh i don't know if eleki is (25:12 - 25:19)
dominant because dynamaxx (25:16 - 25:20)
[Music] (25:19 - 25:22)
um you will find out won't we we will (25:20 - 25:24)
find out (25:22 - 25:26)
reggie drago really didn't see any (25:24 - 25:27)
action (25:26 - 25:29)
uh but maybe because there's no dynamax (25:27 - 25:31)
reggie drago (25:29 - 25:35)
moves up in the list and uh eternitus (25:31 - 25:37)
which was a very bad pokemon in the (25:35 - 25:39)
dynamics format (25:37 - 25:42)
seems really good here because if you (25:39 - 25:42)
can't die (25:42 - 25:44)
if they could never dynamics and now you (25:42 - 25:46)
can't dynomax so (25:44 - 25:49)
they they seem potentially okay here (25:46 - 25:51)
uh but yeah i guess we'll we'll find out (25:49 - 25:56)
so all of july (25:51 - 25:59)
you can still do series nine yep and (25:56 - 26:00)
then (25:59 - 26:02)
start on august 1st yeah yeah august 1st (26:00 - 26:03)
this will start and then (26:02 - 26:08)
we'll run august september and october (26:03 - 26:09)
and then november 1st i don't know (26:08 - 26:12)
what's happening because (26:09 - 26:14)
november is also when diamond pro comes (26:12 - 26:15)
out so (26:14 - 26:17)
i wonder i i wonder if they switched to (26:15 - 26:25)
gs cup at that point but (26:17 - 26:26)
because they do just straight up mention (26:25 - 26:28)
note this is different than previous gs (26:26 - 26:29)
cup regulations (26:28 - 26:30)
so i don't know if they switch to gs cup (26:29 - 26:32)
at that point or they switch (26:30 - 26:34)
immediately like they've done in the (26:32 - 26:36)
past to diamond and pearl format (26:34 - 26:38)
right because they want to sell yep like (26:36 - 26:39)
i mean there have been times where they (26:38 - 26:41)
switched the competitive it's like one (26:39 - 26:45)
week after the game came out (26:41 - 26:45)
or you're those uk players and the (26:45 - 26:48)
weeknd sword and shield came out they're (26:47 - 26:50)
still playing ultrasound ultra moon (26:48 - 26:51)
because they had a regional tournament (26:50 - 26:52)
that weekend (26:51 - 26:55)
oh well (26:52 - 26:55)
this is from the uh twitter.com (26:57 - 27:03)
oreo (27:01 - 27:03)
oreo cookie verified june 30th (27:05 - 27:11)
says our newest collab in september is (27:08 - 27:12)
going to be (27:11 - 27:15)
electric emoji can you guess what it is (27:12 - 27:17)
trainers here are some more hit (27:15 - 27:21)
hints leaf emoji fire emoji water emoji (27:17 - 27:23)
um so i know this is a pokemon podcast (27:21 - 27:25)
but it's really weird that oreo is uh (27:23 - 27:26)
partnering with avatar the last (27:25 - 27:29)
airbender yeah yeah (27:26 - 27:29)
and why would they bring it up it's just (27:30 - 27:33)
so weird (27:32 - 27:35)
uh i personally can't wait for (27:33 - 27:38)
grass-flavored oreos (27:35 - 27:41)
to come you know it's mint you know it's (27:38 - 27:42)
mint (27:41 - 27:44)
i i don't know that do you know that (27:42 - 27:50)
they haven't said their hint was fire um (27:44 - 27:53)
he told me (27:50 - 27:56)
i saw a real good hot take (27:53 - 27:58)
because we we've been comparing the 25th (27:56 - 28:00)
anniversary to the 20th anniversary (27:58 - 28:02)
right i think we all agree that the 20th (28:00 - 28:04)
and our 20th anniversary was better (28:02 - 28:06)
it's great and this has been garbage and (28:04 - 28:08)
the hot take was (28:06 - 28:11)
the 20th anniversary was very good at (28:08 - 28:13)
targeting (28:11 - 28:16)
hardcore fans and the 25th anniversary (28:13 - 28:17)
has been (28:16 - 28:22)
good at targeting who non heartfelt fans (28:17 - 28:23)
i agree because you don't want to over (28:22 - 28:26)
saturate the non-hardcore fans (28:23 - 28:28)
well like what is oreo oreo is literally (28:26 - 28:29)
for people to like (28:28 - 28:31)
walk down the aisle at target or walmart (28:29 - 28:33)
and be like oh there's a pikachu on this (28:31 - 28:35)
i'm gonna buy it yeah that's like (28:33 - 28:36)
literally all that's there for us to (28:35 - 28:37)
remind (28:36 - 28:40)
casual fans that pokemon is a thing so (28:37 - 28:42)
when i look at the last (28:40 - 28:44)
seven months that's like literally (28:42 - 28:45)
everything they've been doing is like (28:44 - 28:49)
they've done one song and but again (28:45 - 28:51)
a collab with oreo that's not like a (28:49 - 28:53)
deluge of things for the casual player (28:51 - 28:56)
technically two songs but um (28:53 - 29:00)
yeah they didn't post malone again which (28:56 - 29:02)
also you see if you think about it was (29:00 - 29:03)
just like hey (29:02 - 29:06)
postmodern like hoodie the blowfish (29:03 - 29:07)
because there unless you knew it (29:06 - 29:09)
specifically for pokemon you would have (29:07 - 29:10)
never made that connection (29:09 - 29:12)
and same with katy perry unless you (29:10 - 29:16)
watch the video the song is so generic (29:12 - 29:18)
like you had to be aware that this was a (29:16 - 29:19)
pokemon (29:18 - 29:21)
thing so you're you're making the (29:19 - 29:23)
argument that the 25th anniversary is (29:21 - 29:25)
designed to appeal to a wider (29:23 - 29:27)
who want your audience who has no idea (29:25 - 29:29)
that pokemon exists that will just be (29:27 - 29:30)
like i'll buy a katie (29:29 - 29:32)
sure (29:30 - 29:32)
is is this gonna be four different oreos (29:34 - 29:38)
or does it just give me one (29:36 - 29:40)
it has to just be like one pack that is (29:38 - 29:42)
not how we do oreos (29:40 - 29:44)
no you never find a multi-flavor pack of (29:42 - 29:45)
oreos (29:44 - 29:48)
oreo fans are purists (29:45 - 29:51)
and dedicated to the type of oreo that (29:48 - 29:51)
they (29:51 - 29:55)
enjoy carrot cake well not not even (29:51 - 29:55)
flavor (29:55 - 29:57)
right because you'll have people who are (29:55 - 29:59)
like man (29:57 - 30:02)
if you don't like double stuff oreos get (29:59 - 30:03)
out my house (30:02 - 30:04)
and then there's the other people who (30:03 - 30:06)
are like but the cookie part is better (30:04 - 30:07)
so i prefer (30:06 - 30:10)
like the the regular stuff oreos (30:07 - 30:12)
right and then yeah you'll have your (30:10 - 30:14)
your carrot cake or your (30:12 - 30:16)
uh whatever bizarre so they're they're (30:14 - 30:18)
going to have (30:16 - 30:21)
red velvet okay will do they have a red (30:18 - 30:23)
velvet already okay first off the lady (30:21 - 30:25)
gaga oreos were some of the best (30:23 - 30:26)
i didn't even know that i don't even (30:25 - 30:28)
look at the oreos as i walked the oreo (30:26 - 30:28)
is like (30:28 - 30:31)
of all the cookies in the universe (30:28 - 30:32)
possibly (30:31 - 30:35)
the worst what flavor was the lady gaga (30:32 - 30:35)
or (30:35 - 30:38)
it was it was pink cookie yeah and then (30:35 - 30:40)
the inside was green (30:38 - 30:42)
cream and then pink cookie again but (30:40 - 30:44)
what were the flavors (30:42 - 30:47)
i don't was it just oreo flavored was it (30:44 - 30:48)
just chocolate and cream no (30:47 - 30:50)
it wasn't it wasn't chocolate was it (30:48 - 30:52)
vanilla (30:50 - 30:56)
ah i don't know so it was hard (30:52 - 30:59)
look i don't you can't describe lady (30:56 - 31:01)
gaga as one flavor greg (30:59 - 31:03)
pikachu i'm not talking about lady gaga (31:01 - 31:07)
i'm talking about lady gaga oreos (31:03 - 31:07)
the pikachu oreo banana (31:07 - 31:14)
oh i mean so hardcore the (31:11 - 31:17)
the um (31:14 - 31:20)
mint grass i think it's just going to be (31:17 - 31:21)
one cookie (31:20 - 31:24)
squirtle no why (31:21 - 31:26)
would they we look we can't really do we (31:24 - 31:28)
can't do fruit flavors in oreo (31:26 - 31:30)
cannot yeah you can lemon the lemon (31:28 - 31:32)
oreos are outstanding they're my (31:30 - 31:33)
favorites (31:32 - 31:34)
i don't think they're making four (31:33 - 31:36)
cookies i think it's one cookie (31:34 - 31:38)
well then yeah and i'm sure it's gonna (31:36 - 31:40)
be like just i'm sure (31:38 - 31:41)
it's gonna be like a poke ball it's (31:40 - 31:43)
gonna be like black cream (31:41 - 31:45)
red cookie on top white cookie on bottom (31:43 - 31:47)
no they can't do two different color (31:45 - 31:48)
cookies (31:47 - 31:49)
that they do not have the machine they (31:48 - 31:52)
don't have the machinery to do it (31:49 - 31:56)
they don't it is a an operation and a (31:52 - 31:58)
violation of the laws of (31:56 - 32:00)
physics to have two different colors (31:58 - 32:01)
oreo (32:00 - 32:03)
can not think of a time that they've (32:01 - 32:04)
done two different colors (32:03 - 32:08)
it cannot be done when you (32:04 - 32:09)
it's like do you know how like when (32:08 - 32:11)
you're trying to like push (32:09 - 32:14)
like two positive on a magnet and two (32:11 - 32:16)
negative or whatever north and south and (32:14 - 32:16)
it's (32:16 - 32:18)
and it's like no matter how hard you (32:16 - 32:20)
push those two are never going to come (32:18 - 32:21)
together (32:20 - 32:22)
that's what would happen if you tried to (32:21 - 32:25)
put two different color oreo cookies (32:22 - 32:28)
on i mean oreos are granimals in cookie (32:25 - 32:29)
form (32:28 - 32:33)
and if you at home (32:29 - 32:37)
get regular chocolate oreos (32:33 - 32:40)
and the yellow cookie (32:37 - 32:43)
oreos i don't know what those are golden (32:40 - 32:44)
goals sure (32:43 - 32:47)
whatever and take off like (32:44 - 32:49)
one of the chocolates and one of the (32:47 - 32:52)
goldens and try to put those together (32:49 - 32:55)
you're it it looks we are coming for you (32:52 - 32:56)
you are (32:55 - 33:02)
evil you are wrong that's too much work (32:56 - 33:04)
somebody's got to do it just because you (33:02 - 33:06)
know that there's kids out there who are (33:04 - 33:07)
just like (33:06 - 33:09)
i'm going to do this one bad thing just (33:07 - 33:10)
to prove that i have (33:09 - 33:13)
like free will in the universe so (33:10 - 33:14)
saturday nights when i used to (33:13 - 33:17)
do gaming in person your oreo (33:14 - 33:18)
aberrations (33:17 - 33:20)
is that saturday night we used to always (33:18 - 33:21)
buy a whole (33:20 - 33:23)
box of oreos we used to all buy the (33:21 - 33:25)
different flavors of oreos and then (33:23 - 33:26)
taste test (33:25 - 33:29)
so oreos don't come in boxes (33:26 - 33:30)
even if it's in a box they don't come in (33:29 - 33:33)
boxes oreos come in sleeves (33:30 - 33:36)
you would consume a sleeve of oreos i've (33:33 - 33:37)
never (33:36 - 33:39)
opened row i've been doing this podcast (33:37 - 33:40)
for 11 years (33:39 - 33:42)
i have never heard will get so worked up (33:40 - 33:43)
about any of the top (33:42 - 33:47)
cooking he won't even eat true but (33:43 - 33:54)
that's because will is a hydrox fan boom (33:47 - 33:54)
let me tell you the optimal way of (33:58 - 34:02)
eating an oreo here's the 7 million iq (34:00 - 34:05)
take don't even open the package put it (34:02 - 34:06)
in trash (34:05 - 34:08)
there you go go get a nice oatmeal (34:06 - 34:10)
raisin cookie (34:08 - 34:12)
you take a fork and you stab the cream (34:10 - 34:13)
of the oreo (34:12 - 34:17)
what monster are you i'm not even pork (34:13 - 34:17)
has come (34:17 - 34:21)
into this with an oreo here we go (34:17 - 34:22)
what are you doing you get a fork you (34:21 - 34:25)
stab the cream of the oreo and then you (34:22 - 34:27)
dunk the oreo in milk (34:25 - 34:29)
and now you pull out the whole oreo so (34:27 - 34:30)
the whole oreo gets milk (34:29 - 34:33)
you get no milk on your fingers the the (34:30 - 34:34)
fork (34:33 - 34:36)
right in your mouth and then you got (34:34 - 34:39)
clean hands and you have a fully dunked (34:36 - 34:43)
slightly soggy or oh it's mwah (34:39 - 34:45)
it's so good it's like the best way to (34:43 - 34:47)
you cannot eat oreos with (34:45 - 34:49)
milk listeners this is what it's like (34:47 - 34:51)
this is what it's like being with steve (34:49 - 34:55)
this is what it's like i am changing (34:51 - 34:58)
you are lives (34:55 - 34:58)
people's lives and creating fractures in (34:59 - 35:02)
reality (35:02 - 35:05)
with your terrible ideas and let me give (35:02 - 35:06)
you (35:05 - 35:08)
the correct version of everything that (35:06 - 35:09)
steve just said (35:08 - 35:13)
the proper the good the holy (35:09 - 35:16)
and sanctified sandwich cookie (35:13 - 35:20)
is the nutter butter (35:16 - 35:20)
so what you do is you take one of those (35:20 - 35:27)
with your fingers not a fork and (35:23 - 35:30)
scoop it in peanut butter and then eat (35:27 - 35:32)
the peanut butter off the nutter butter (35:30 - 35:37)
yes we're going to take a break (35:32 - 35:40)
and when we come back uh we're going to (35:37 - 35:43)

july 4. (36:43 - 36:56)
[Applause] (36:59 - 37:03)
we are back from our break (37:06 - 37:13)
hey it is the start of the month it is a (37:10 - 37:16)
perfect time to sign up for our patreon (37:13 - 37:21)
patreon.com pkmncast (37:16 - 37:24)
we have one or two vip slots open if (37:21 - 37:25)
you're interested in that (37:24 - 37:28)
we have some producer slots open if (37:25 - 37:29)
you're interested in that (37:28 - 37:32)
but more importantly for five dollars a (37:29 - 37:32)
month greg (37:32 - 37:35)
only five dollars a month they can hear (37:32 - 37:36)
you (37:35 - 37:39)
and me talk about our first pokemon (37:36 - 37:41)
experiences (37:39 - 37:44)
i even listened to that one with other (37:41 - 37:46)
members i finally figured out how to get (37:44 - 37:47)
it (37:46 - 37:49)
and that was that was a super fun (37:47 - 37:52)
conversation it was fun hearing (37:49 - 37:55)
from members of the community and having (37:52 - 37:57)
them come up and talk about (37:55 - 38:00)
just it was such a (37:57 - 38:02)
warm and positive experience hearing (38:00 - 38:04)
everybody's first experiences with (38:02 - 38:04)
pokemon (38:04 - 38:06)
it was a fun the hour flew by it was (38:04 - 38:08)
super fun (38:06 - 38:10)
also for clarification as greg had (38:08 - 38:11)
speculated at the beginning of that (38:10 - 38:12)
recording (38:11 - 38:15)
that i was napping with my cat that (38:12 - 38:18)
number one that does not happen number (38:15 - 38:19)
two uh (38:18 - 38:21)
you guys were recording on a saturday (38:19 - 38:22)
evening and for me (38:21 - 38:24)
saturday evenings are reserved for (38:22 - 38:26)
watching the newest episode of my hero (38:24 - 38:27)
academia (38:26 - 38:30)
and eating korean food so that is what i (38:27 - 38:33)
was actually doing (38:30 - 38:37)
uh the biggest (38:33 - 38:40)
piece of feedback we get is that we (38:37 - 38:44)
that listeners want more to listen to (38:40 - 38:46)
and they wish our podcasts were like 10 (38:44 - 38:48)
hours long don't we like (38:46 - 38:51)
cumulatively do like 40 podcasts where (38:48 - 38:52)

upset about the whole thing and it was (41:08 - 41:13)
the worst (41:11 - 41:16)
it was the worst event i (41:13 - 41:19)
worked hard i (41:16 - 41:23)
walked outside for like 20 minutes and (41:19 - 41:23)
completed (41:23 - 41:27)
all four steps i ran into (41:23 - 41:30)
like 200 b doof and not one of them (41:27 - 41:31)
shined (41:30 - 41:34)
so garbage event ah so this is the (41:31 - 41:35)
classic (41:34 - 41:37)
if i get a shiny the event was good it (41:35 - 41:38)
was great it would have been freddy if (41:37 - 41:39)
that was bad (41:38 - 41:42)
it was bad yeah we we have established (41:39 - 41:44)
this is how these work (41:42 - 41:47)
okay so some history here uh b doof has (41:44 - 41:49)
always been (41:47 - 41:52)
a joke in the pokemon fandom it has (41:49 - 41:55)
always been this like (41:52 - 41:57)
b doof is the thing you have to have on (41:55 - 41:59)
your team and diamond pearl because it (41:57 - 42:00)
requires so many hms (41:59 - 42:04)
and b doof is like the the rattata (42:00 - 42:06)
or the central that people just seem to (42:04 - 42:08)
like more (42:06 - 42:10)
because of its utility of hms you can (42:08 - 42:13)
stack a lot of hms onto a badoof (42:10 - 42:16)
yes and there's (42:13 - 42:20)
it's it's kind of been a meme pokemon (42:16 - 42:22)
for quite a while (42:20 - 42:22)
and for whatever reason the 25th (42:25 - 42:29)
anniversary (42:27 - 42:31)
diamond pro remix coming out they (42:29 - 42:33)
decided that this was the year (42:31 - 42:36)
to really focus on b doof (42:33 - 42:39)
which is like cool it's fine like it is (42:36 - 42:40)
it is refreshing (42:39 - 42:44)
to get attention on a pokemon that isn't (42:40 - 42:46)
pikachu that isn't charizard (42:44 - 42:47)
you know they kind of did this with (42:46 - 42:48)
slowpoke you know they do that for april (42:47 - 42:49)
fools they do the (42:48 - 42:52)
the slowpoke song and they you know did (42:49 - 42:53)
the (42:52 - 42:56)
slowpoke glasses and pokemon go where (42:53 - 42:58)
it's he's like a year behind (42:56 - 43:00)
like they kind of run that joke into the (42:58 - 43:03)
ground (43:00 - 43:07)
but this is what i will say (43:03 - 43:08)
to be fair there are there is the (43:07 - 43:10)
pokemon company which is (43:08 - 43:12)
japan focus and then there's the pokemon (43:10 - 43:14)
company international which is mostly (43:12 - 43:18)
english focused well it's international (43:14 - 43:19)
focused (43:18 - 43:23)
the pokemon company international (43:19 - 43:27)
in my opinion spent more effort (43:23 - 43:32)
and time in bedoof day (43:27 - 43:35)
than all of the 25th anniversary yeah (43:32 - 43:37)
yeah not wrong and yeah wrong shame on (43:35 - 43:39)
you for bringing that up (43:37 - 43:42)
like they really look i i'm not saying (43:39 - 43:44)
bedoof day was bad (43:42 - 43:48)
but i am saying they put a lot into this (43:44 - 43:49)
day (43:48 - 43:52)
will july 1st be badoofday for all (43:49 - 43:54)
eternity going forward (43:52 - 43:56)
yeah i don't see why not why not i mean (43:54 - 43:57)
why not it's (43:56 - 43:59)
it's the world we deserve not the one (43:57 - 44:00)
that we want (43:59 - 44:03)
true true they they just (44:00 - 44:07)
really it i mean it wasn't bad it was (44:03 - 44:07)
good (44:07 - 44:09)
it was like a good day it was it was (44:07 - 44:12)
cute but like the joke (44:09 - 44:16)
like it was sort of hard to be like (44:12 - 44:16)
it's a one note joke that was kind of (44:17 - 44:22)
funny back when they did it for april (44:20 - 44:22)
fools (44:22 - 44:24)
and it's back again so they could test (44:22 - 44:26)
the branching (44:24 - 44:29)
event they put into pokemon go that (44:26 - 44:31)
they're going to use for go fest (44:29 - 44:33)
so like it was a cute way to sort of (44:31 - 44:35)
test to make sure things (44:33 - 44:39)
worked uh for go and then (44:35 - 44:40)
everywhere else was just like yeah it's (44:39 - 44:43)
bidoof day because (44:40 - 44:45)
why the heck not let's just go all in (44:43 - 44:47)
it's it says bedoof day on the google (44:45 - 44:49)
cal for the entire pokemon company (44:47 - 44:50)
because that's how they plan all the (44:49 - 44:54)
events at the same time and (44:50 - 44:58)
uh let's just go for it it (44:54 - 44:58)
it's it was fine if as it didn't make (45:00 - 45:04)
really any sense (45:03 - 45:08)
and it was just like okay (45:04 - 45:11)
is this actually going anywhere and the (45:08 - 45:13)
answer is no (45:11 - 45:16)
it's just there we (45:13 - 45:19)
we have to point out that the song that (45:16 - 45:20)
they created (45:19 - 45:23)
for the day of every (45:20 - 45:26)
like from the pokemon company pokemon (45:23 - 45:28)
company international (45:26 - 45:31)
official song about a pokemon that has (45:28 - 45:33)
ever been made this is (45:31 - 45:35)
absolutely the worst the lowest amount (45:33 - 45:36)
of effort (45:35 - 45:40)
was put into i mean yes (45:36 - 45:42)
i like the song they tried to rick roll (45:40 - 45:44)
everybody that was cute (45:42 - 45:48)
but could you not have put half an ounce (45:44 - 45:49)
of energy towards writing (45:48 - 45:53)
lyrics lyrics (45:49 - 45:56)
were so i would rather watch (45:53 - 45:59)
a two-hour video of (45:56 - 46:02)
where is magnemite here is magnemite (45:59 - 46:04)
where is magnemite here is magnesium (46:02 - 46:05)
right (46:04 - 46:08)
then that when which when you write the (46:05 - 46:10)
lyrics to the magikarp being the saddest (46:08 - 46:11)
pokemon (46:10 - 46:15)
you you've already set the bar too high (46:11 - 46:17)
and they just can't do it anymore that (46:15 - 46:19)
magic part is incredible (46:17 - 46:22)
every month they had tons of time (46:19 - 46:24)
to plan for badoofday it's been on the (46:22 - 46:26)
calendar (46:24 - 46:29)
could they not have hired a fantastic (46:26 - 46:31)
lyricist (46:29 - 46:33)
i i think the okay i think the b do song (46:31 - 46:34)
was fine (46:33 - 46:36)
let me listen (46:34 - 46:36)
this is everything angry because i time (46:37 - 46:41)
from my life was taken (46:39 - 46:43)
as i sat and watched the entire thing (46:41 - 46:45)
saying there's there's got to be (46:43 - 46:46)
something (46:45 - 46:48)
better (46:46 - 46:48)
so they did b doof and pokemon go they (46:49 - 46:55)
had a very in my opinion okay (46:52 - 46:57)
i'm already getting sidetracked the (46:55 - 47:00)
bedoof and go having bidoof spawn (46:57 - 47:02)
having pedufan raids even five-star (47:00 - 47:03)
raids (47:02 - 47:07)
um and this specifically i think that (47:03 - 47:08)
questline (47:07 - 47:13)
was so clever and funny (47:08 - 47:13)
and i enjoyed it a lot compared to like (47:14 - 47:19)
the roasted berries of tepig (47:16 - 47:21)
uh or the um just the community day (47:19 - 47:22)
stuff like with that (47:21 - 47:27)
like i think as a hardcore pogo player (47:22 - 47:29)
there's no reason not to buy the dollar (47:27 - 47:30)
community (47:29 - 47:32)
stuff because you're already out and the (47:30 - 47:34)
things you get from it are worth it (47:32 - 47:36)
you get the incense you get the star (47:34 - 47:37)
piece you get the rocket radar (47:36 - 47:39)
like you're a hardcore player you're (47:37 - 47:40)
probably going to use all these items (47:39 - 47:43)
so it is definitely worth the dollar to (47:40 - 47:44)
get the star (47:43 - 47:46)
dust and the experience and the extra (47:44 - 47:47)
like (47:46 - 47:50)
it's fine but most people like i i (47:47 - 47:52)
i am sure that person exists you're not (47:50 - 47:54)
a hardcore player greg don't give me (47:52 - 47:56)
those side eyes (47:54 - 47:58)
how many pokemon have you powered up a (47:56 - 48:00)
lot because i have to do it for things (47:58 - 48:04)
i'm just saying i i did not but i did (48:00 - 48:07)
what did not buy the dollar uh this time (48:04 - 48:07)
around (48:07 - 48:11)
i skipped it i think the dollar is (48:07 - 48:11)
always worth it (48:11 - 48:13)
if you're planning on playing like the (48:11 - 48:15)
entire six hours you're already (48:13 - 48:16)
dedicating so much of your (48:15 - 48:18)
time to this game you might as well (48:16 - 48:19)
spend the dollar and get more value out (48:18 - 48:20)
of it (48:19 - 48:23)
in my opinion that being said i am sure (48:20 - 48:24)
there are some people out there (48:23 - 48:27)
although probably very rare that want to (48:24 - 48:29)
have that little story line (48:27 - 48:31)
and i think sometimes the story line is (48:29 - 48:33)
cute of like the gimbal like biting your (48:31 - 48:36)
ankles or whatever but it's (48:33 - 48:39)
but it's also i would probably imagine (48:36 - 48:41)
for most people they just skip through (48:39 - 48:41)
the storyline (48:41 - 48:44)
i do and i know i can just go to sarah b (48:41 - 48:45)
or wherever and i can just like reread (48:44 - 48:46)
the storyline (48:45 - 48:48)
if i'm ever like okay what happened here (48:46 - 48:50)
like it's documented forever (48:48 - 48:54)
but the bidoof storyline was so (48:50 - 48:57)
cute and so good that you didn't want to (48:54 - 48:59)
skip it and they even take it a little (48:57 - 49:00)
fur they took it a little further and (48:59 - 49:01)
they're like (49:00 - 49:04)
okay you got two dramatic choices here (49:01 - 49:06)
and they were like (49:04 - 49:07)
and it was like you you like clicked on (49:06 - 49:09)
one and then you went back because you (49:07 - 49:10)
wanted to click on the other and it was (49:09 - 49:11)
just very charming (49:10 - 49:16)
and i want that expect like i want that (49:11 - 49:18)
to those dollar community like i want to (49:16 - 49:20)
be i want it to be good enough where i (49:18 - 49:21)
stop to actually (49:20 - 49:25)
read it um well i read the community day (49:21 - 49:26)
one and (49:25 - 49:30)
at the end was very offended because (49:26 - 49:33)
classic professor willow asked me to do (49:30 - 49:33)
a (49:33 - 49:35)
ton of work and then he's like all right (49:33 - 49:37)

a ship by the way uh it's very cute (54:53 - 54:58)
it is cute that was the thing i got from (54:56 - 54:59)
bdoof day (54:58 - 55:02)
i think it's awesome and very cool that (54:59 - 55:03)
the pokemon company (55:02 - 55:06)
partnered with mondo and (55:03 - 55:10)
um an independent artist (55:06 - 55:12)
got to do artwork officially and this (55:10 - 55:14)
says game freak on it and it says the (55:12 - 55:17)
pokemon company and it says nintendo (55:14 - 55:21)
and it is an official poster done (55:17 - 55:24)
by s with a collaboration (55:21 - 55:27)
very cool i the only thing that i'm (55:24 - 55:29)
coming away from b doof day (55:27 - 55:31)
is everything you've done here do this (55:29 - 55:32)
for (55:31 - 55:35)
all of your events yeah (55:32 - 55:37)
partner with people acknowledge the (55:35 - 55:40)
pokemon trading card game online (55:37 - 55:42)
make your go events like you did with (55:40 - 55:44)
the b dupe make them charming like this (55:42 - 55:44)
like (55:44 - 55:47)
keep doing what you did here this is my (55:44 - 55:49)
takeaway from b doof day (55:47 - 55:54)
uh so (55:49 - 55:54)
very i was overall very happy with b (55:55 - 55:58)
doof day (55:58 - 56:00)
canada came out of nowhere they kind of (55:58 - 56:02)
beat a dead horse with it (56:00 - 56:05)
they really did but overall i would say (56:02 - 56:07)
it was a it was a success (56:05 - 56:10)
um it was it was a fun day to be a (56:07 - 56:13)
pokemon fan (56:10 - 56:13)
also the most work they probably did (56:13 - 56:18)
compared to the last six months (56:15 - 56:18)
yeah i mean it felt like they were (56:22 - 56:26)
actually doing (56:24 - 56:30)
something major it's just it was like (56:26 - 56:32)
and you just limited it to be like i (56:30 - 56:34)
think what frustrates me is like it was (56:32 - 56:35)
a glimpse of what they could have been (56:34 - 56:38)
doing this entire year (56:35 - 56:41)
maybe for the 25th anniversary be doing (56:38 - 56:42)
going forwards (56:41 - 56:44)
hopefully more to look forward to i mean (56:42 - 56:45)
i'm that is my hope (56:44 - 56:48)
but i will tell you we are at the start (56:45 - 56:50)
of july and they have stomped all hope (56:48 - 56:54)
out of my heart i will say (56:50 - 56:57)
update as of this recording all three be (56:54 - 56:58)
duped t-shirts sold out the play mats (56:57 - 57:01)
sold out the hat and the plush are still (56:58 - 57:02)
pre-order they wouldn't ship anyways the (57:01 - 57:05)
sign sold out (57:02 - 57:09)
um so yeah i mean (57:05 - 57:14)
they did something right i guess (57:09 - 57:15)
the one thing that i feel like we don't (57:14 - 57:17)
talk about enough on the show (57:15 - 57:22)
is in japan (57:17 - 57:25)
they get new merch like every two weeks (57:22 - 57:27)
uh and pokey jungle is a really good (57:25 - 57:28)
account to follow uh (57:27 - 57:30)
because they'll tweet all the new merch (57:28 - 57:32)
but like that's not a new thing (57:30 - 57:35)
they have been doing this for a decade (57:32 - 57:37)
like a decade (57:35 - 57:40)
and when you're in a pokemon center in (57:37 - 57:43)
japan and you see all that merch (57:40 - 57:45)
and you go back like a month later it's (57:43 - 57:46)
all different like they they're just (57:45 - 57:49)
cycling out merch consistently and it (57:46 - 57:49)
does very (57:49 - 57:51)
very well here we like if you if you're (57:49 - 57:53)
a new listener if you haven't listened (57:51 - 57:54)
to our older shows we've talked about (57:53 - 57:55)
this before (57:54 - 57:57)
but the pokemon company is very (57:55 - 57:58)
profitable (57:57 - 58:00)
and you would think maybe it's because (57:58 - 58:02)
of go or you would think maybe it's (58:00 - 58:02)
because of (58:02 - 58:04)
you know the main series games like (58:02 - 58:05)
sword shield or let's go or heart goals (58:04 - 58:07)
or silver it's not (58:05 - 58:09)
their money comes from merch they are a (58:07 - 58:10)
merch (58:09 - 58:13)
machine 60 of all their revenue i think (58:10 - 58:14)
it's a little higher i think it's like (58:13 - 58:15)
64 (58:14 - 58:18)
of all their revenue is merchandise and (58:15 - 58:19)
i feel like the trend (58:18 - 58:23)
this year for america is they are (58:19 - 58:26)
catching up and i feel like every week (58:23 - 58:27)
they are putting something new on (58:26 - 58:28)
pokemon center.com (58:27 - 58:31)
even if it's one or two things that i i (58:28 - 58:32)
really thought (58:31 - 58:34)
when they launched pokemon center.com (58:32 - 58:36)
like two years ago (58:34 - 58:38)
that it was gonna be dead in the water (58:36 - 58:39)
after like three months (58:38 - 58:40)
here's a bunch of stuff here's a bunch (58:39 - 58:43)
of plushes we're never gonna update it (58:40 - 58:46)
everything's sold out uh and there was (58:43 - 58:47)
like a small period where like they (58:46 - 58:49)
weren't updating it (58:47 - 58:51)
and everything was kind of sold out but (58:49 - 58:52)
now they're just (58:51 - 58:54)
pumping out much like every week i feel (58:52 - 58:57)
like pokemon center has something new (58:54 - 59:00)
and it's like there are some things (58:57 - 59:02)
exclusive to our pokemon center compared (59:00 - 59:04)
to japan like japan doesn't get these (59:02 - 59:04)
ceramic (59:04 - 59:06)
figures that they keep or resin figures (59:04 - 59:08)
that they keep pumping out (59:06 - 59:09)
and we don't get a lot of like the (59:08 - 59:10)
japanese stuff like they got like a (59:09 - 59:11)
sinister (59:10 - 59:14)
teapot which was cool or a polti guys (59:11 - 59:15)
teapot i should say (59:14 - 59:17)
and we may get that like we get some of (59:15 - 59:19)
the japan stuff like (59:17 - 59:20)
six months after like they get their (59:19 - 59:23)
sitting cuties well in advance before us (59:20 - 59:25)
like they have all gen three sitting (59:23 - 59:26)
cuties i don't think we're there yet (59:25 - 59:28)
with gen three sitting cuties (59:26 - 59:34)
um but yeah the (59:28 - 59:34)
the pokemon center is is is like i feel (59:34 - 59:40)
like this (59:38 - 59:40)
money making machine even in a time (59:40 - 59:46)
where like (59:44 - 59:47)
you know sword shield's almost two two (59:46 - 59:49)
years old it's a little long in the (59:47 - 59:50)
tooth (59:49 - 59:53)
a little long in the tooth (59:50 - 59:56)
but man they they have their hands (59:53 - 59:59)
in so many pots is that an expression (59:56 - 60:00)
hands in the pots (59:59 - 60:04)
no no no sure just (60:00 - 60:06)
just you look you've already defeated me (60:04 - 60:07)
many times this show (60:06 - 60:10)
so i've recovered from the eu thing (60:07 - 60:13)
so sure whatever you want i'm still (60:10 - 60:14)
thinking about bear tick from last week (60:13 - 60:17)
honestly (60:14 - 60:17)
good old bear tick uh anyways (60:17 - 60:26)
uh final bit of news here is (60:22 - 60:26)
that they're doing kind of irl pokemon (60:27 - 60:31)
go stuff (60:30 - 60:33)
and we'll we'll end with this we don't (60:31 - 60:34)
spend too much time on it but this is (60:33 - 60:36)
off pokemon go live (60:34 - 60:38)

previous pokemon go (60:58 - 61:02)
events uh these outdoor socially (61:00 - 61:04)

note an in-game go fest ticket will not (63:12 - 63:16)

musical adventure that is go fest no (63:28 - 63:30)
matter where you play we hope that this (63:29 - 63:32)
year event can make (63:30 - 63:35)
your favorite places feel extra special (63:32 - 63:36)
and then they say like make sure you (63:35 - 63:39)
follow guidelines and stuff (63:36 - 63:41)
okay (63:39 - 63:41)
so the complaint here is probably (63:42 - 63:49)
more so focused to europe since their (63:45 - 63:52)
vaccine rollout is not as quick as the (63:49 - 63:54)
united states and they have had a (63:52 - 63:58)
increase in cases with the delta variant (63:54 - 64:01)
yes but they also i mean there is an (63:58 - 64:03)
application to the us too which was that (64:01 - 64:05)
throwaway line at the beginning of like (64:03 - 64:08)
please follow travel guidance (64:05 - 64:11)
for the locations because i like i know (64:08 - 64:12)
dc (64:11 - 64:15)
if you are coming to dc from another (64:12 - 64:15)
state (64:15 - 64:17)
you are supposed to quarantine for 14 (64:15 - 64:19)
days yep (64:17 - 64:22)
so like don't show up at dc the day (64:19 - 64:23)
before (64:22 - 64:25)
and expect to go to this event because (64:23 - 64:26)
you're not welcome (64:25 - 64:28)
okay but i feel like we have to talk (64:26 - 64:30)
about the event itself it's just (64:28 - 64:34)
yes photo op it's yeah it's (64:30 - 64:35)
it's like but they didn't give any (64:34 - 64:37)
detail right (64:35 - 64:41)
yeah so my so when i asked giant (64:37 - 64:44)
okay so you okay so when i talked to (64:41 - 64:46)
niantic and i said (64:44 - 64:49)
i just like are these players getting (64:46 - 64:50)
anything that other players are not (64:49 - 64:51)
getting (64:50 - 64:53)
are they getting better spawns are they (64:51 - 64:55)
getting you know more gifts from (64:53 - 64:56)
pokestops (64:55 - 65:00)
they just told me that it is just (64:56 - 65:01)
the photo opera you just get the (65:00 - 65:04)
exclusive picture (65:01 - 65:06)
they're saying that it is a physical (65:04 - 65:10)
photo op (65:06 - 65:10)
but players will not receive anything in (65:12 - 65:15)
in (65:14 - 65:18)
game or real life it is literally just a (65:15 - 65:21)
picture opportunity yes that's all it is (65:18 - 65:25)
that makes sense so possibly a food (65:21 - 65:26)
truck (65:25 - 65:27)
congregated nearby that you could (65:26 - 65:30)
purchase food items from (65:27 - 65:30)
so just like everything covered related (65:33 - 65:41)
this was probably planned a while ago (65:37 - 65:41)
when things were looking good (65:41 - 65:46)
it probably didn't seem too terrible to (65:44 - 65:48)
set up (65:46 - 65:51)
right i don't know how i don't know how (65:48 - 65:53)
complicated or how hard it is to make (65:51 - 65:56)
however many photo opportunities stands (65:53 - 65:57)
we don't even know what they look like (65:56 - 65:58)
they're probably it's probably like (65:57 - 65:59)
mellowetta and (65:58 - 66:01)
galerion zigzagoon or something some (65:59 - 66:03)
sort of like (66:01 - 66:05)
maybe like a band shell like where a (66:03 - 66:06)
performance uh (66:05 - 66:08)
would be and it's like maybe you can (66:06 - 66:10)
stand in the band shell (66:08 - 66:11)
and look like you're on stage with (66:10 - 66:14)
meluetta or something weird like that (66:11 - 66:18)
they gotta so what 25 cities (66:14 - 66:20)
or something they they hire 25 people (66:18 - 66:22)
off craigslist or whatever to stand (66:20 - 66:23)
there (66:22 - 66:24)
to look at your phone no well no no (66:23 - 66:26)
that's like a real thing like (66:24 - 66:27)
i don't know if people know this but (66:26 - 66:29)
like when nintendo does their like (66:27 - 66:30)
pop-up booths (66:29 - 66:33)
at like mall of america or mayfair they (66:30 - 66:35)
literally just get people off craigslist (66:33 - 66:37)
and they pay them like 25 dollars an (66:35 - 66:38)
hour and they say like this is like a (66:37 - 66:40)
three-day gig (66:38 - 66:43)
and that's it and they sign an nda and (66:40 - 66:44)
they they show people how to play like (66:43 - 66:46)
wii sports and then they like move on (66:44 - 66:49)
like that's like what they do um because (66:46 - 66:50)
they're going from city to city so they (66:49 - 66:52)
need local people to run these booths (66:50 - 66:54)
and they like walk away with a free (66:52 - 66:55)
nintendo shirt and like (66:54 - 66:58)
500 bucks (66:55 - 66:58)
so they're setting up 25 booths (66:59 - 67:05)
you're you have to register to even like (67:03 - 67:07)
stand in a line (67:05 - 67:08)
you go you get up there you take a (67:07 - 67:10)
picture and then you're done that's like (67:08 - 67:10)
it right (67:10 - 67:13)
i don't think personally i understand i (67:10 - 67:14)
totally understand the concern but i (67:13 - 67:16)
don't think it's like that big of a deal (67:14 - 67:19)
like it's an outside take a picture (67:16 - 67:21)
that that is your day and then you're (67:19 - 67:22)
done like there's nothing else to do (67:21 - 67:23)
there (67:22 - 67:27)
yeah and what the concern is (67:23 - 67:31)
that they they aren't implying like (67:27 - 67:34)
if you're unable to write like so when (67:31 - 67:35)
we went to go fast (67:34 - 67:37)
people just walked into the park like (67:35 - 67:39)
there wasn't a person that (67:37 - 67:41)
stopped you and checked your ticket it's (67:39 - 67:43)
just that things that activated (67:41 - 67:46)
so i think what people's fear of is (67:43 - 67:49)
looking at past events (67:46 - 67:51)
more people that have tickets (67:49 - 67:53)
potentially will show up (67:51 - 67:55)
and attempt to do the thing that they (67:53 - 67:56)
aren't going to be able to do (67:55 - 68:00)
and in past events niantic did not have (67:56 - 68:02)
gatekeeping they did not have a good way (68:00 - 68:04)
they relied completely on the app of (68:02 - 68:05)
doing that (68:04 - 68:08)
and since this is (68:05 - 68:08)
not detailed on the website there is (68:08 - 68:12)
concern that there are a number of (68:10 - 68:13)
people who are just (68:12 - 68:17)
going to show up and make this (68:13 - 68:19)
more (68:17 - 68:19)
potentially dangerous than it needs to (68:21 - 68:28)
be um for (68:24 - 68:30)
a photo op and they're sort of walking (68:28 - 68:31)
this line (68:30 - 68:34)
of fear of misting out but also be (68:31 - 68:38)
safe it's just like (68:34 - 68:40)
i mean like they say like don't worry (68:38 - 68:41)
the pokemon go fest experience will be (68:40 - 68:43)
the same for everyone around the world (68:41 - 68:45)
like like it's almost like these press (68:43 - 68:46)
releases need like an (68:45 - 68:48)
faq but i think the problem is like no (68:46 - 68:50)
one would read it like i (68:48 - 68:51)
i had i went to niantic i got (68:50 - 68:53)
clarification that it's literally just (68:51 - 68:56)
some standee that you will be able to (68:53 - 68:57)
take a picture in front of (68:56 - 68:58)
which is cool if you're in that city (68:57 - 69:00)
totally cool um (68:58 - 69:04)
you know but i would (69:00 - 69:06)
i would assume for most people they're (69:04 - 69:08)
they're not going to be like oh i live (69:06 - 69:09)
in kenosha wisconsin i'm going to drive (69:08 - 69:11)
down to chicago because i want a picture (69:09 - 69:12)
with mellowetta (69:11 - 69:14)
i'm sure i'm sure one of the or two or (69:12 - 69:16)
three of those people exist (69:14 - 69:18)
yes um but i don't think the vast (69:16 - 69:20)
majority of like (69:18 - 69:22)
fans are gonna be like oh it's just oh (69:20 - 69:24)
it's just a photo opportunity okay i (69:22 - 69:25)
don't have to go to chicago (69:24 - 69:27)
but to be fair if you live in kenosha i (69:25 - 69:29)
would say maybe you should go to chicago (69:27 - 69:31)
because it's a better place to play (69:29 - 69:35)
than kenosha like there's just more gyms (69:31 - 69:36)
more stops more (69:35 - 69:38)
spawns because it's just because the (69:36 - 69:39)
spawns and everything are based on cell (69:38 - 69:40)
phone traffic there's just so many (69:39 - 69:42)
people in chicago it's a great city to (69:40 - 69:43)
play at (69:42 - 69:47)
um well i think i think honestly (69:43 - 69:50)
i'm developing a new rule for 2021. (69:47 - 69:52)
follow it if you wish don't follow it if (69:50 - 69:53)
you don't wish (69:52 - 69:57)
but here's will anderson's rule for 2021 (69:53 - 70:00)
do the things that you're comfortable (69:57 - 70:01)
doing (70:00 - 70:04)
don't complain about people doing things (70:01 - 70:07)
that you are not comfortable doing (70:04 - 70:10)
done do it if you want to (70:07 - 70:18)
don't do it if you don't (70:10 - 70:21)
i just leave it there this is (70:18 - 70:24)
a lot i could say about this it's it is (70:21 - 70:25)
it is what it is i don't (70:24 - 70:28)
i don't i'm not behind niantic's many (70:25 - 70:32)
choices currently so (70:28 - 70:35)
i don't think this is the worst but i (70:32 - 70:36)
understand the concern i don't want to (70:35 - 70:39)
sound like it's like if i was in (70:36 - 70:41)
if i was going to chicago would i sign (70:39 - 70:42)
up for this photo opportunity (70:41 - 70:46)
yes i would if i was going to chicago (70:42 - 70:46)
which was a (70:46 - 70:47)
which was a thought we talked about on (70:46 - 70:49)
the show like are we going to go to (70:47 - 70:50)
chicago this year (70:49 - 70:53)
uh and if this was in minneapolis would (70:50 - 70:54)
we (70:53 - 70:55)
the three of us sign up for this i think (70:54 - 70:57)
i would yeah yeah (70:55 - 71:00)
um but (70:57 - 71:01)
i don't know what the situation like are (71:00 - 71:03)
they gonna have a person standing there (71:01 - 71:05)
saying like okay everyone's six feet (71:03 - 71:06)
apart (71:05 - 71:08)
yeah like i mean like if if those (71:06 - 71:10)
questions were answered (71:08 - 71:12)
i think people would feel i think the (71:10 - 71:13)
people who have concerns and your (71:12 - 71:14)
concerns are 100 (71:13 - 71:17)
valid 100 valid uh i think people would (71:14 - 71:19)
then feel better (71:17 - 71:21)
but (71:19 - 71:21)
like i don't know i i like (71:22 - 71:27)
what what does this look like it's (71:25 - 71:29)
almost like what if they had a picture (71:27 - 71:29)
of like (71:29 - 71:31)
this is what the photo opera looks like (71:29 - 71:33)
this is what the line looks like (71:31 - 71:35)
if you want to sign up cool hey don't (71:33 - 71:36)
worry though if you're (71:35 - 71:40)
in uh if you're in uh (71:36 - 71:44)
san antonio don't drive an hour to (71:40 - 71:44)
austin (71:44 - 71:47)
maybe it's an hour and a half because (71:44 - 71:48)
it's not worth it (71:47 - 71:51)
right i think i think the problem is is (71:48 - 71:52)
they are still (71:51 - 71:55)
putting out press releases (71:52 - 71:59)
with limited details (71:55 - 72:02)
in a situation where we need better (71:59 - 72:03)
details to make (72:02 - 72:06)
more informed decisions given the state (72:03 - 72:06)
of the (72:06 - 72:10)
world and i think what frustrates me and (72:06 - 72:12)
a lot of other people is the fact that (72:10 - 72:13)
they want to (72:12 - 72:17)
they want it always and (72:13 - 72:17)
people are going to make ill-informed (72:18 - 72:22)
decisions (72:21 - 72:25)
because you have not provided them (72:22 - 72:27)
the proper amount of information and it (72:25 - 72:29)
is not hard to provide that information (72:27 - 72:31)
like again if you had a like i said if (72:29 - 72:33)
there's a picture of what the plan (72:31 - 72:36)
is like this is what the photo op is (72:33 - 72:38)
this is what we're planning (72:36 - 72:39)
because you know they've had to have it (72:38 - 72:42)
to plan it because (72:39 - 72:45)
they've had to have this i don't know (72:42 - 72:46)
there's certain amounts that you just (72:45 - 72:48)
can't plan for (72:46 - 72:50)
yeah but you know what your setup is (72:48 - 72:51)
going to be if you're going into the (72:50 - 72:52)
city (72:51 - 72:54)
and saying hey we're going to set this (72:52 - 72:55)
up you have (72:54 - 72:56)
talked to them at least a month in (72:55 - 72:58)
advance okay but this is the other thing (72:56 - 73:00)
i don't get (72:58 - 73:01)
maybe it tells you when you sign up i (73:00 - 73:04)
didn't sign up chicago's a big city (73:01 - 73:06)
where is this stand this where where am (73:04 - 73:07)
i going where am i going i think it (73:06 - 73:09)
doesn't tell you until you sign up (73:07 - 73:12)
yes like where like is there just one (73:09 - 73:16)
is there two is there four (73:12 - 73:19)
yeah like is there one person working it (73:16 - 73:21)
is there five people working it (73:19 - 73:25)
is it gonna be roped off did like (73:21 - 73:25)
like did chicago pay for this did (73:26 - 73:30)
niantic pay chicago (73:28 - 73:32)
like what yeah it's just like i get (73:30 - 73:34)
there's a lot of parties involved (73:32 - 73:36)
there's a lot of different cities (73:34 - 73:38)
there's the pokemon company there's (73:36 - 73:40)
niantic this was probably planned for a (73:38 - 73:40)
while (73:40 - 73:42)
they had to go to some company to build (73:40 - 73:44)
some of these standees (73:42 - 73:47)
that they got laying around and you know (73:44 - 73:49)
maybe they built the standees (73:47 - 73:50)
and they were like oh we're going to (73:49 - 73:51)
take a huge loss on these standees (73:50 - 73:52)
because we (73:51 - 73:54)
were hoping covid was going to be solved (73:52 - 73:55)
by it then and (73:54 - 73:57)
maybe we can try to get some of our (73:55 - 73:59)
money back by partnering with atlanta (73:57 - 74:03)
but again like denver atlanta chicago (73:59 - 74:04)
indianapolis new york (74:03 - 74:06)
these are huge cities where where are (74:04 - 74:09)
you going (74:06 - 74:09)
what is happening well calling (74:10 - 74:15)
indianapolis a huge city is a bit of a (74:13 - 74:16)
stretch (74:15 - 74:19)
it's very spread out it is very spread (74:16 - 74:19)
out (74:19 - 74:22)
i would assume that the indianapolis one (74:19 - 74:23)
would like (74:22 - 74:25)
my assumption is like the chicago one is (74:23 - 74:27)
probably by the the bean (74:25 - 74:28)
the indianapolis one is probably buy (74:27 - 74:30)
that giant roundabout statue with the (74:28 - 74:31)
fountain (74:30 - 74:33)
that would be my guess austin is (74:31 - 74:34)
probably by (74:33 - 74:37)
17 food trucks yes (74:34 - 74:39)
that is basically the perfect (74:37 - 74:43)
description of all of austin (74:39 - 74:46)
it's i i i it's so hard because i (74:43 - 74:49)
i see i see like okay if you're in the (74:46 - 74:50)
city (74:49 - 74:52)
if you're playing go safely it's outside (74:50 - 74:53)
this is like a fun probably ten minute (74:52 - 74:54)
thing out of your day (74:53 - 74:55)
like people like you're not going to (74:54 - 74:57)
stand there for an hour you're getting a (74:55 - 74:58)
picture and you're moving on (74:57 - 75:00)
so like yeah this seems fun and then i (74:58 - 75:02)
see the other side of like why even do (75:00 - 75:02)
this (75:02 - 75:06)
like i see both sides um (75:02 - 75:06)
i don't know in the audio podcast i'm (75:07 - 75:11)
throwing my hands up i don't know i i i (75:09 - 75:14)
don't have a good answer it's it's it's (75:11 - 75:16)
a test for future (75:14 - 75:17)
go fest to see if they can hold a (75:16 - 75:21)
physical event in multiple cities (75:17 - 75:21)
very simple version of it next year (75:22 - 75:26)
it'll be (75:25 - 75:30)
more advanced yeah (75:26 - 75:33)

speaking of games this is from tom from (77:57 - 78:01)
our youtube (77:59 - 78:03)
some of y'all asking look i love our (78:01 - 78:05)
youtube comments they're very (78:03 - 78:06)
nice and humble at least in the podcast (78:05 - 78:10)
episodes they're very nice (78:06 - 78:10)
boy my youtube shorts you get some wild (78:10 - 78:14)
comments on those (78:13 - 78:16)
uh some of y'all writing paragraphs (78:14 - 78:18)
though which is very nice we're gonna do (78:16 - 78:20)
an easy one this week this is from tom (78:18 - 78:21)
says stepping away from maine title (78:20 - 78:23)
games do you have any ideas for spin-off (78:21 - 78:25)
pokemon games that haven't been (78:23 - 78:28)
from here in england thank you tom i am (78:25 - 78:28)
still (78:28 - 78:32)
100 behind a pokemon tower defense (78:28 - 78:35)
game (78:32 - 78:35)
i feel like power defense is so 2012. (78:36 - 78:41)
they are still making them they're still (78:39 - 78:43)
fun do you and they're still fun (78:41 - 78:45)
are we going back to clash royale no (78:43 - 78:47)
that's not tower defense (78:45 - 78:51)
that's yeah tower chess (78:47 - 78:51)
i still want a pokemon racing game like (78:52 - 78:56)
legit actually pokemon racing game (78:54 - 78:58)
like a mario kart where they're in cars (78:56 - 79:00)
yeah yeah yeah okay (78:58 - 79:02)
like pikachu in a car well i would be (79:00 - 79:04)
yeah because so you could like (79:02 - 79:07)
the problem with pokemon is an erasing (79:04 - 79:09)
concept is just some pokemon are (79:07 - 79:10)
naturally faster (79:09 - 79:11)
and then like something can fly and some (79:10 - 79:14)
can only swim so like if you had (79:11 - 79:16)
a vehicle that was like oh pikachu (79:14 - 79:17)
driving a swanna (79:16 - 79:19)
vehicle but then you could change out (79:17 - 79:21)
the pikachu to be like oh he's in (79:19 - 79:23)
now the pikachu's in like a giggleth (79:21 - 79:25)
vehicle because gigoloth could never (79:23 - 79:26)
race (79:25 - 79:30)
he's too slow he's slow (79:26 - 79:33)
but even if it was like (79:30 - 79:33)
i would just be super happy if it was (79:34 - 79:37)
just (79:36 - 79:40)
they put link in isabel and mario kart (79:37 - 79:42)
why can't we just have like (79:40 - 79:45)
squirtle that's squirtle (79:42 - 79:48)
war turtle like that that would probably (79:45 - 79:49)
literally not old enough to drive (79:48 - 79:53)
no satisfy my my itch for the the (79:49 - 79:55)
pokemon mario kart kind of situation (79:53 - 79:55)
what if they put (79:55 - 79:59)
uh a mario party pokemon game (79:55 - 80:02)
so no this is what i was thinking dr (79:59 - 80:06)
evie which is similar to dr mario (80:02 - 80:08)
where things drop in and you've got to (80:06 - 80:10)
match them and not fill up the thing (80:08 - 80:13)
but if you get the correct evolution (80:10 - 80:16)
order sequencing then the pokemon (80:13 - 80:18)
evolves and you get abilities that (80:16 - 80:18)
assist (80:18 - 80:21)
with your doctor evie yeah i like that (80:18 - 80:23)
so like a pokemon tetris (80:21 - 80:28)
type version or pokemon puyo puyo or (80:23 - 80:28)
etc (80:31 - 80:35)
trying to think of what else i mean they (80:33 - 80:36)
did a pokemon fighting game that was (80:35 - 80:37)
pretty cool (80:36 - 80:40)
yeah uh (80:37 - 80:40)
let me bring back pokemon ranger i do i (80:41 - 80:44)
do (80:44 - 80:47)
i do like the the mario party situation (80:44 - 80:49)
yeah they kind of did that with animal (80:47 - 80:51)
crossing but they messed it up yeah (80:49 - 80:52)
they we should do a non-messed up (80:51 - 80:56)
pokemon version a pokemon (80:52 - 81:00)
portal like a hyper realistic first (80:56 - 81:01)
person (81:00 - 81:04)
puzzle game where you have to somehow (81:01 - 81:08)
incorporate pokemon to escape the rooms (81:04 - 81:08)
and (81:08 - 81:12)
solve the puzzles um like (81:08 - 81:18)
detective pikachu after dark for adults (81:12 - 81:18)
they could literally take the 14 games (81:19 - 81:24)
from stadium one (81:23 - 81:28)
and the 14 games from stadium (81:24 - 81:30)
and then just add a bunch of new games (81:28 - 81:32)
that are literally reskins of like (81:30 - 81:34)
instead of (81:32 - 81:38)
catching digletts you're catching uh (81:34 - 81:41)
patrats or watch hogs that pop up (81:38 - 81:43)
you remember the ekans you like pull (81:41 - 81:44)
back the airplanes you get you just (81:43 - 81:46)
change it out for like watch hogs (81:44 - 81:48)
um they could just like reskin or they (81:46 - 81:50)
could just make a couple new ones and (81:48 - 81:51)
they could (81:50 - 81:54)
add a board yeah like even if the board (81:51 - 81:56)
part was bad (81:54 - 81:58)
uh which it probably would be people (81:56 - 82:00)
would just be like oh i can play stadium (81:58 - 82:02)
mini games on switch that's like (82:00 - 82:04)
like yeah well they would just buy it (82:02 - 82:05)
because they like like that those mini (82:04 - 82:08)
those mini games were pretty good each (82:05 - 82:09)
stage (82:08 - 82:12)
is a gym and you are collecting badges (82:09 - 82:16)
from the gym leaders instead of stars (82:12 - 82:16)
oh i said oh i see you were going back (82:17 - 82:20)
to the board game party yes (82:19 - 82:25)
mario party stadium did have gym leaders (82:20 - 82:27)
yeah but like if so if like it was (82:25 - 82:29)
pokemon party (82:27 - 82:32)
and each board was a gym (82:29 - 82:35)
and instead of stars you got badges and (82:32 - 82:37)
you moved your (82:35 - 82:40)
pokemon around the gym and then all the (82:37 - 82:41)
media games from stadium and all the (82:40 - 82:42)
other ones (82:41 - 82:44)
are the things you fight against each (82:42 - 82:46)
other (82:44 - 82:52)
sold done easy check please nintendo (82:46 - 82:54)
hey you know it's 25th anniversary they (82:52 - 82:56)
could surprise us with uh (82:54 - 82:58)
a brand new game later this year (82:56 - 83:00)
probably not that's not how they work (82:58 - 83:02)
that's not what's going to happen stop (83:00 - 83:03)
getting your hopes up (83:02 - 83:07)
this has been a terrible anniversary (83:03 - 83:09)
we had could be worse could be worse (83:07 - 83:10)
could be worse (83:09 - 83:13)
uh he was going to be much better five (83:10 - 83:15)
months left of the year (83:13 - 83:17)
uh will give us a pokemon of the week (83:15 - 83:20)
all right so the pokemon from last week (83:17 - 83:23)
uh as one that i got newly added to my (83:20 - 83:25)
pokedex in pokemon go (83:23 - 83:29)
by completing a what (83:25 - 83:33)
five month old special research (83:29 - 83:33)
that originally had required that you (83:33 - 83:37)
battled jesse and james but since jesse (83:35 - 83:39)
and james aren't in the game anymore had (83:37 - 83:41)
been subsequently edited (83:39 - 83:45)
um the uh this pokemon had been added to (83:41 - 83:46)
pokemon go (83:45 - 83:49)
on may 17 2019 but cannot (83:46 - 83:52)
be caught in eggs or (83:49 - 83:56)
uh in the wild you have to use a mossy (83:52 - 83:58)
lure on a pokestop which (83:56 - 83:59)
you know everybody who visited the art (83:58 - 84:01)
park yesterday you're welcome (83:59 - 84:03)
for all of the inappropriate lures that (84:01 - 84:04)
i placed (84:03 - 84:08)
up magnets we put up ice we put up (84:04 - 84:10)
mossy and specifically one of the (84:08 - 84:12)
premium blurs (84:10 - 84:17)
oh yeah uh specifically in pokemon go it (84:12 - 84:19)
can evolve into one of two final forms (84:17 - 84:21)
because for whatever reason its second (84:19 - 84:22)
evolution is (84:21 - 84:24)
basically in pokemon go considered as (84:22 - 84:26)
almost like two different pokemon (84:24 - 84:28)
um so for those of you who guessed the (84:26 - 84:30)
final evolution you (84:28 - 84:31)
obviously weren't paying attention when (84:30 - 84:33)
i said that this pokemon can evolve (84:31 - 84:36)
but yes that's very specific to go how (84:33 - 84:38)
it works in other pokemon games (84:36 - 84:40)
is very different okay the more than (84:38 - 84:43)
enough information (84:40 - 84:47)
who is it it's (84:43 - 84:50)
zig zagoon yeah (84:47 - 84:54)
it's cherubi (84:50 - 84:57)
ruby is that cherry (84:54 - 85:01)
this it doesn't matter it's disturbing (84:57 - 85:04)
have you ever read the pokedex entry (85:01 - 85:07)
uh the shuffle is gorgeous uh (85:04 - 85:10)
the shiny is okay it's just weirdly (85:07 - 85:11)
lighter and i'm not a fan (85:10 - 85:13)
you know how cherubi has that like (85:11 - 85:14)
second head (85:13 - 85:17)
hanging off the pokedex entry i think (85:14 - 85:18)
it's the pokemon go (85:17 - 85:21)
does pokemon go have pokedex entries no (85:18 - 85:22)
no (85:21 - 85:25)
somewhere somewhere it's basically says (85:22 - 85:28)
that trueby stores nutrients in that (85:25 - 85:31)
second head and then like (85:28 - 85:34)
uses them and i'm like oh why (85:31 - 85:38)
why does it have to have a face then (85:34 - 85:40)
it nimbly dashes about to avoid getting (85:38 - 85:42)
pecked by bird pokemon that would love (85:40 - 85:42)
to make (85:42 - 85:45)
off with its small nutrient-rich storage (85:42 - 85:46)
ball (85:45 - 85:50)
yes with a face with a face (85:46 - 85:50)
is there maybe it's like maybe it's like (85:53 - 85:57)
a decoys (85:55 - 85:59)
like the birds will take that one and (85:57 - 86:00)
the main body will get away like (85:59 - 86:03)
dogs that have like the the little marks (86:00 - 86:04)
above their eyes (86:03 - 86:06)
yeah which are not eyebrows they're so (86:04 - 86:08)
that when the dog is sleeping it looks (86:06 - 86:09)
like their eyes are still open (86:08 - 86:13)
mm-hmm uh no there's no trivia dang (86:09 - 86:15)
tribby seems to be based on a cherry oh (86:13 - 86:17)
my gosh that's it's trivia (86:15 - 86:19)
all right what about next week here we (86:17 - 86:20)
go (86:19 - 86:23)

from sibling nintendo based (86:30 - 86:35)
home video game series pokemon sun and (86:32 - 86:37)
pokemon moon (86:35 - 86:40)

characters (86:48 - 86:51)
up special moves does not leave the (86:48 - 86:53)
pokemon helpless (86:51 - 86:56)
but is dangerous to use on stages where (86:53 - 86:57)
falling off the side (86:56 - 87:00)
is a possibility as it requires (86:57 - 87:01)
preparing for the landing location (87:00 - 87:06)
before you initiate the move (87:01 - 87:06)
[Laughter] (87:07 - 87:12)

bowl of tomato soup (87:26 - 87:29)
