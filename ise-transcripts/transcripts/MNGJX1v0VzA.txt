[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 468th episode of the pokemon podcast it's super effective uh glory to america to those in america well in the united states because let's remember like canada mexico those are in north america central america is a thing and south america is a thing so we don't get to claim all of america although we do try we do try and we often ignore anybody else so glory to us in america yes greg is here i am here i am fresh from a fourth of july parade in 101 heat i it is not 101. it was in the sun uh will also here no tank top no uh we've got element um elements skateboards i'm not a poser i do own an element skateboard trying to get them brand deals all i wanted to say is answer me this really this bit is getting no that's the name of a podcast they have our their next episode next month because they've gone to monthly is episode 400 and they're quitting we have beat yes another one down another one so much for quality we'll give you quantity glory 2 it's super effective i know those brits cancelled that's very weird in the podcast space of like this probably applies to like youtubers and other content creators too but like just shows existing for 10 15 years and then yeah one day they they're done i think with answering me this it's been obvious for probably the past five years that they haven't wanted to do it anymore and then they were just like you know what it's episode 400. we really don't want to do this anymore let's just go out on an even number i mean i'm i support that that is valid i was super in a night vale until they started doing those live podcasts and then i was like instantly out uh live you mean would they record their live programs yeah so they would do like their stories and then there they got to like episode like 60 and they did one in front of an audience and like having the audience laugh at like that's okay that's right humor that's what killed nightvale for me too as i watched a video of a live performance and it's like all the people in the audience the the way that i always put it it's like they the audience were thinking well i'm supposed to laugh at this so let me laugh out loud so people know that i get the joke too i never got just dumb i never got past night vale episode three i could yeah i listened to the first ten episodes probably like uh four or five times because i like a lot of people because a lot of my friends at the time started it as well so um and then yeah once we get to live because like when you're listening to night vale you're never actually laughing out loud correct it was just like oh that's clever like oh very but then when you're hearing people laugh at the dry humor you're like it's not that funny exactly well it's not it's not laugh out loud funny it's like think about it and get an internal chuckle i just couldn't get past the affectations like it just their performance hey hey you you can't talk about affectations on this program i can because they're no this is all that's all we are they're the way they performed that character bothered me deeply and i could never get past it well it's not like you went to acting school greg come on it's not it's not like i did a six-year college degree i have a bfa thank you very much a bachelor of fine arts unlike whatever yours is you know it's a piece of paper i can tell you that uh we got actually quite a bit of news today a lot of it revolves around bdoof but i think we'll save that part because there was a lot of b doof related things and uh whoo that's like both good and bad uh there's i mean it was one joke and they milked that joke for everything they could and i have some ratings to give out and yeah i mean it was okay ah so we'll we'll we'll get to the b do stuff uh let's start off with the pokemon masters news uh because we haven't talked about masters in a hot minute come on masters uh i did talk to dna full disclosure i am partnered with dna i said look dna papa dna i cannot put kakui and the mass royale in the same sink pear party there's an obvious bug there's an obvious obvious bug uh and then they said well you know a lot of people have been experiencing this well we're gonna have to get back to you it doesn't make any sense yeah because i mean i haven't they're very different characters they're very different characters they don't even know each other as far as i can tell like i i don't even know when they would have met so there's that also i haven't pulled mascara out i did i spent all my gems in pulling kiawah because i wanted the best alolan pokemon alolan marowak and i finally got it wait you like alolan merriweath yeah who doesn't like a little shirt that i've worn on community today while you were there another is this usually i feel like i know all your favorite pokemon i didn't know marowak was one no no regular marowak is just ground normal garbage alolan marijuana lowland marowak is outstanding uh so you didn't pull the master out i didn't i pulled kia away and nobody else because i my gems my gem in flux is pitifully slow well we are eventually getting to the two year anniversary was that like a month or two away yeah yeah uh so the the news here is emmett and ingo for reasons so wait for the two-year anniversary i can't say this joke do you think hold on i i know there were i know this is off topic do you think that no probably not because we know that we know that dynamics is coming yeah yeah my thoughts are everywhere we know that dynamaxx is coming to pokemon masters they said that yeah um and i think they said by the two-year anniversary yes and we have leon and we have nessa and we have who's the other one marley mark we have yeah we have marnie we have nessa we have leon pierce but piers doesn't die to max pierce has an imax do we have reihan yeah we have reihan raihan and he is doraledon yep so that's g max leon has charizard that's g max yup uh marnie is more peco so no no but could die to max has dreadna yeah so gmax could be gmax they've done such a good job in the last like year and a half of lining events up mm-hmm and obviously gigantomax will eventually come to masters even though like we are already fighting big pokemon in like a raid battle sense but i would i would be curious of gigantomax like if you want gigantivex charizard if they would they need more like ex rate stuff and they know that ex for aids like we know that that's coming back we talked about that a week ago so what are you switching now you're switching to go yeah i just wonder if they're gonna line the two up oh i see so you're saying we're gonna because we know when gigantomax is coming we know that well i guess we're assuming it's coming for the two year but i swear they said that at one point i don't know that i remember them saying that specifically but i think they've heavily implied that there's going to be a that it's going to come at the two-year anniversary yeah uh but they normally in go do something big for like there's usually one big mechanic they do and go like last year was megas was it last year i can't remember when people were complaining it was last year um anyways uh for characters we never thought would come to masters ingo and excadrill and emmett and archaeops are coming to are here will knows who they are they're the battle subway bosses from the unova region correct will what's your hot take on these two dudes i mean that's a unique feature of the black and white games that wasn't carried forward but they're just you know you battle your way through the battle subway and finally get to the conductors what more is there to say spoiler alert they're building a battle subway in paizo passive what are they really that's that's their storyline yeah they want to build a battle subway are there enough locations to travel to to require a a subway i'm not going to spoil the story of what they find and how they make their thing remember that i'm you could only get to by riding the train and it was like the train turn around town yeah you know just fantastic you know i'm waiting for the character that gets will hardcore in the masters this we're already two years past any possibility i i i just i can't my only response to gotcha games is to continually ask all of you people please let the industry know that we don't want gotcha games by stop playing them red is the only way they will learn is if you all stop playing gotcha games they will stop making gotcha games yeah but everyone's playing [ __ ] impact at this point everything i stopped playing yeah yeah i i had to stop i didn't get very far into it uh so fyi there are a lot of people i know that were confused as to why ingo and emmett have ex gadrill and archeops uh they i'm assuming those people never battled like these like those aren't their pokemon they did well they it's their pokemon on the 49th consecutive battle it's not what they have the first time so if you only got to 20 uh you never you never saw it and it's also only through the multi trains like it's a very specific like it happened in the second team set but they do have them but also when has pokemon masters ever hewn so close to what pokemons would be related with anything they do they do they do they do the only time they don't is when it's the uh the alternate clothing what is that called um well sigma sigma suits is what strays away from the main series lore uh segment suits and um i feel like i've heard you guys complain about shouldn't this person have shown up with this pokemon but they actually should didn't do it well how are we gonna have eight charizards in the game when there's so many people that are so identified with charizard yeah but the charizards are different ones it's gonna there are things like don is here with turtwig and you know don had piplup in the anime hello hello so there's i mean there are things like that because they gave barry piplup so yeah but what else were they going to give barry come on i know so i mean there there are there are s they stray from people's expectations but usually there is an underlying reason unless it's a sigma suit or a holiday specific pair you know but after this game almost existing for two years it's kind of nice that the cigna suits stray away from that because otherwise you wouldn't get you wouldn't ever see specific pokemon right because if you're only limiting yourself to like gym leaders like they run out of pokemon relatively quickly i mean they have a lot of battle frontier battle subways and battle towers and battle manor they have a lot of people to pull from they're not going to run out anytime soon yeah i think what's really interesting though about including emmett and ingo is there are people who were even like hardcore fans and players of black and white black and white too who even played extensive post game who never encountered emmett and ningo yeah so in black white black black 2 white 2 you do have to fight them once they're outside of the subway and they you have to do a double battle with them with your um with bianca i think not bianca uh hugh hugh yeah so you and hugh have to battle them once and then you can just completely ignore them but in the first one in first black and white you could just never go into the subway and never see them and never see them uh the i i i did hear i heard the same complaint you heard greg which is like why do they have these pokemon we talked about that the other thing is like i saw people were upset they were like fair scout but when they announced these characters in japan they were trending on twitter like these are two super popular characters in japan and so like even though like i know a bunch of people being like i'm skipping these i'm not going to fair scout for them it's like that's fine yeah japan will gladly pay for everything they need to pay in facebook they have a lot they have a lot they have two men are too many banners running right now anyways so it's fine if you skip yeah and it's totally fine to skip and i think i don't know why people feel they need to pull on every new banner and because polling is fun i get it pulling is fun it's it is the nature of gotcha games where they make it like these are new and exciting and you get to pull these these new and exciting potentially high quality sink pairs uh and you know they make a big deal out of them and they get introduced and their stories around them and also in their own storyline if you have them you get better rewards from that storyline so there's like multiple layers as to why you want to pull on that banner because like in their storyline they give a 1.6 times boost to getting the tickets right right as a reward and nobody else gives you that much so even having just one of them increases the amount of tickets you get from that um so like it's built into the gain economy to make you want to pull on them but as a gotcha game player resists the urge you don't need it you will get even if you have the 1.4 if you line everybody up who has it you will get so many tickets you run out of the top tier rewards anyways if you do it every day and do 10 of them with your tickets and stamina that's the only thing you do you will have more than enough to buy everything out of the item shop i think it's cool they added these two characters though even if you don't like them like it's cool that the i feel like every time they add a not like a character that people forget about like bingo and emmett we get one step closer to mir b and ludacola every i will pay potential money to pull mirror being ludicolo you have no idea how much i want mirror b i love mirror b so much i i have gone on record many times not liking gale darkness or coliseum but there's two things about those games that are huge bangers number one the music the music is incredible the music in those games out but easily the best feature number two is just mere be in general as a character yes top two things of those games those games are brilliant so whatever you're such you're just such a hater i can't even stand it but mirror b is a great thing i think the compliments of the game i will i they've never released the soundtrack for those here have they i wonder if there's i wonder if they did release them in japan i don't think they did i don't think they did we need we still don't have sword and chill soundtrack either i know we need braxton berks to make remake a jazz band version of all those okay songs there's your pokemon masters minute uh i'm sure let's start i'm sure we'll start talking about more closer to closer to as they release more things i'm sure i'm just hoping for a real good gem sale that's what i i mean it if if mirror b is coming in the two year anniversary i will also hope for a good gem sale uh this is off pokemon.com uh uh they have announced series 10 for competitive play here starting august 1st and that will go for three months for pokemon sword and shield uh as previously seen in ranked series eight trainers could include one restricted pokemon from the list of their uh one restricted pokemon listed below for their battle team uh this is different than gs cup which people thought was gonna be series 10 and then the twist to series 10 is that you will not be allowed to dynamics so the restricted pokemon are normally box pokemon now i get this all the time when i'm doing competitive they're like wow there's a lot of legendaries uh and it seems unfair it's not there are legendaries that are just straight up bad like savalai and type null and cosmog just because the pokemon's legendary doesn't mean by default it's automatically good um but the box legends uh which is the probably the easiest way to classify them the you're allowed to have one on your team so that would be mewtwo lugia ho-oh kyogre groudon spoiler kyogre groudon are some of the best uh rayquaza dialga palkia guillotina restaurant zekrom spoiler giratina is probably one of the worst uh kirum xerneas evital zygarde cosmo cosmo don't have to asterix that solgaleo lunala necrozma zashi and zamazenta spoilers zamasunt is very bad uh eternitus and calarex with calorics that would also be caloric's riding spectre and glass tree so shadow rider or ice rider that being said you could have calorics on spectrier and you could still have a glass gear on your team you just can't have calorics writing both um is zernia still really good or is ernest so zernius was awful in dynamaxx format which is really funny because everyone thought dynamaxx zernigs would be unstoppable uh but it just didn't work out that way so xernia should be good again now that there's no dynamics now going back to the earlier thing where they did mention gs cup gs cup was like the end of ultrasound ultra moon uh where you could have two legendary pokemon or sorry two box legends so you would see a lot of people running kyogre and groudon or kyogre and rayquaza or groudon rayquaza um or xerneas groudon usually groudon and kyger was somewhere in that combination because they control weather very well so not that and then we i just want to mention this because they were because people are silly they're like oh they finally realized dynamics was bad no that's not what they're doing they did this in ultrasound ultramoon where they they did a whole format where they were like no z moves and then they did a whole format where they were like no megas and then they did a whole format where they were like you could use both uh fyi this is called data collection and you're doing it for them for free yeah um you know if you're not super in competitive and we said we've seen these people we talk about these people all the time where they're like wow drug dog set up stealth rock it's so broken like we see these kind of like these people are not in competitive they think they're in a competitive they complain about the metagame they don't play the manda game there are lots of things that were changed um that like for example mamo swine had peck you could prior to gen 8 you could use peck on mamo swine no one ever did that because it was a bad move on mamo swine in gen 7 and gen 6 and gen 5. do you know why they got rid of peck because max airstream mamo swine would have been really good yeah man of swine dynamixing and then setting up airstream for speed control is incredibly powerful yeah so they're very they're and why did they get rid of that that would have been awesome i love mammoths because mamo swine can never be king be careful what you ask for mammal shrine is one of my favorites so dynamite's fourth favorite it is [Music] so dynamics was really good to get around things like fake out um to get around things like accuracy evasion um you know dynamics moves hit dynamax also takes a move like dazzling gleam and instead of making it a double target it makes it a single target so when you know a pokemon dynamax's you know they're stuck in single target they can only pick one so there's a lot of structure issues that dynamics does very well but now without dynamax you're going to see a lot more fake out um and you are going to see ershifu and no they did not ban urshifu or she i don't know why they would they clearly this is the thing is they they it's their game they can change their po they have changed their pokemon they have changed their moves they have changed stats they have like nerfed pokemon before talonflame was very very good in gen five and then they were like whoa gale wing's ability is way too strong we need to change this in gen six yeah boom so i don't see third gale wings yeah so uh urshi fu being very good uh because it's ability is unseen fist so it means that you cannot protect in front of hershifu so you have situations now or you will in series 10 where they lead urshifu and they lead somebody that has fake out and you can't protect against the fake out because urshifu will just break through protect and you can't dynamax max guard uh because you can't dynamics you can't dynamics so this will lead to really interesting situations and it should make the format very different than what we saw at the end of series seven with a lot of kyogre a lot of groudon a lot of rayquaza megas um i don't know if it'll like i don't know if it'll be good or bad uh zashian is here now urshifu is here now both calorixes are here the ice rider shadow rider you can still use the regular glass rear urshifu is here so there's a lot of new pokemon that really dictate what other pokemon you can use that being said the best pokemon in the format is still and always will be or incineroar which is not a legendary pokemon uh but a very very good pokemon oh and we still have eloquent we have elokie we have reggie drago um alakia has been very very dominant uh i don't know if eleki is dominant because dynamaxx [Music] um you will find out won't we we will find out reggie drago really didn't see any action uh but maybe because there's no dynamax reggie drago moves up in the list and uh eternitus which was a very bad pokemon in the dynamics format seems really good here because if you can't die if they could never dynamics and now you can't dynomax so they they seem potentially okay here uh but yeah i guess we'll we'll find out so all of july you can still do series nine yep and then start on august 1st yeah yeah august 1st this will start and then we'll run august september and october and then november 1st i don't know what's happening because november is also when diamond pro comes out so i wonder i i wonder if they switched to gs cup at that point but because they do just straight up mention note this is different than previous gs cup regulations so i don't know if they switch to gs cup at that point or they switch immediately like they've done in the past to diamond and pearl format right because they want to sell yep like i mean there have been times where they switched the competitive it's like one week after the game came out or you're those uk players and the weeknd sword and shield came out they're still playing ultrasound ultra moon because they had a regional tournament that weekend oh well this is from the uh twitter.com oreo oreo cookie verified june 30th says our newest collab in september is going to be electric emoji can you guess what it is trainers here are some more hit hints leaf emoji fire emoji water emoji um so i know this is a pokemon podcast but it's really weird that oreo is uh partnering with avatar the last airbender yeah yeah and why would they bring it up it's just so weird uh i personally can't wait for grass-flavored oreos to come you know it's mint you know it's mint i i don't know that do you know that they haven't said their hint was fire um he told me i saw a real good hot take because we we've been comparing the 25th anniversary to the 20th anniversary right i think we all agree that the 20th and our 20th anniversary was better it's great and this has been garbage and the hot take was the 20th anniversary was very good at targeting hardcore fans and the 25th anniversary has been good at targeting who non heartfelt fans i agree because you don't want to over saturate the non-hardcore fans well like what is oreo oreo is literally for people to like walk down the aisle at target or walmart and be like oh there's a pikachu on this i'm gonna buy it yeah that's like literally all that's there for us to remind casual fans that pokemon is a thing so when i look at the last seven months that's like literally everything they've been doing is like they've done one song and but again a collab with oreo that's not like a deluge of things for the casual player technically two songs but um yeah they didn't post malone again which also you see if you think about it was just like hey postmodern like hoodie the blowfish because there unless you knew it specifically for pokemon you would have never made that connection and same with katy perry unless you watch the video the song is so generic like you had to be aware that this was a pokemon thing so you're you're making the argument that the 25th anniversary is designed to appeal to a wider who want your audience who has no idea that pokemon exists that will just be like i'll buy a katie sure is is this gonna be four different oreos or does it just give me one it has to just be like one pack that is not how we do oreos no you never find a multi-flavor pack of oreos oreo fans are purists and dedicated to the type of oreo that they enjoy carrot cake well not not even flavor right because you'll have people who are like man if you don't like double stuff oreos get out my house and then there's the other people who are like but the cookie part is better so i prefer like the the regular stuff oreos right and then yeah you'll have your your carrot cake or your uh whatever bizarre so they're they're going to have red velvet okay will do they have a red velvet already okay first off the lady gaga oreos were some of the best i didn't even know that i don't even look at the oreos as i walked the oreo is like of all the cookies in the universe possibly the worst what flavor was the lady gaga or it was it was pink cookie yeah and then the inside was green cream and then pink cookie again but what were the flavors i don't was it just oreo flavored was it just chocolate and cream no it wasn't it wasn't chocolate was it vanilla ah i don't know so it was hard look i don't you can't describe lady gaga as one flavor greg pikachu i'm not talking about lady gaga i'm talking about lady gaga oreos the pikachu oreo banana oh i mean so hardcore the the um mint grass i think it's just going to be one cookie squirtle no why would they we look we can't really do we can't do fruit flavors in oreo cannot yeah you can lemon the lemon oreos are outstanding they're my favorites i don't think they're making four cookies i think it's one cookie well then yeah and i'm sure it's gonna be like just i'm sure it's gonna be like a poke ball it's gonna be like black cream red cookie on top white cookie on bottom no they can't do two different color cookies that they do not have the machine they don't have the machinery to do it they don't it is a an operation and a violation of the laws of physics to have two different colors oreo can not think of a time that they've done two different colors it cannot be done when you it's like do you know how like when you're trying to like push like two positive on a magnet and two negative or whatever north and south and it's and it's like no matter how hard you push those two are never going to come together that's what would happen if you tried to put two different color oreo cookies on i mean oreos are granimals in cookie form and if you at home get regular chocolate oreos and the yellow cookie oreos i don't know what those are golden goals sure whatever and take off like one of the chocolates and one of the goldens and try to put those together you're it it looks we are coming for you you are evil you are wrong that's too much work somebody's got to do it just because you know that there's kids out there who are just like i'm going to do this one bad thing just to prove that i have like free will in the universe so saturday nights when i used to do gaming in person your oreo aberrations is that saturday night we used to always buy a whole box of oreos we used to all buy the different flavors of oreos and then taste test so oreos don't come in boxes even if it's in a box they don't come in boxes oreos come in sleeves you would consume a sleeve of oreos i've never opened row i've been doing this podcast for 11 years i have never heard will get so worked up about any of the top cooking he won't even eat true but that's because will is a hydrox fan boom let me tell you the optimal way of eating an oreo here's the 7 million iq take don't even open the package put it in trash there you go go get a nice oatmeal raisin cookie you take a fork and you stab the cream of the oreo what monster are you i'm not even pork has come into this with an oreo here we go what are you doing you get a fork you stab the cream of the oreo and then you dunk the oreo in milk and now you pull out the whole oreo so the whole oreo gets milk you get no milk on your fingers the the fork right in your mouth and then you got clean hands and you have a fully dunked slightly soggy or oh it's mwah it's so good it's like the best way to you cannot eat oreos with milk listeners this is what it's like this is what it's like being with steve this is what it's like i am changing you are lives people's lives and creating fractures in reality with your terrible ideas and let me give you the correct version of everything that steve just said the proper the good the holy and sanctified sandwich cookie is the nutter butter so what you do is you take one of those with your fingers not a fork and scoop it in peanut butter and then eat the peanut butter off the nutter butter yes we're going to take a break and when we come back uh we're going to talk about beedoofday so we will see you in a bit uh yeah glory to america a little cherubic child running up and down gold medal parks

okay let's talk about beedoof where do you want to start a one i didn't get a golden beaver and i'm very upset about the whole thing and it was the worst it was the worst event i worked hard i walked outside for like 20 minutes and completed all four steps i ran into like 200 b doof and not one of them shined so garbage event ah so this is the classic if i get a shiny the event was good it was great it would have been freddy if that was bad it was bad yeah we we have established this is how these work okay so some history here uh b doof has always been a joke in the pokemon fandom it has always been this like b doof is the thing you have to have on your team and diamond pearl because it requires so many hms and b doof is like the the rattata or the central that people just seem to like more because of its utility of hms you can stack a lot of hms onto a badoof yes and there's it's it's kind of been a meme pokemon for quite a while and for whatever reason the 25th anniversary diamond pro remix coming out they decided that this was the year to really focus on b doof which is like cool it's fine like it is it is refreshing to get attention on a pokemon that isn't pikachu that isn't charizard you know they kind of did this with slowpoke you know they do that for april fools they do the the slowpoke song and they you know did the slowpoke glasses and pokemon go where it's he's like a year behind like they kind of run that joke into the ground but this is what i will say to be fair there are there is the pokemon company which is japan focus and then there's the pokemon company international which is mostly english focused well it's international focused the pokemon company international in my opinion spent more effort and time in bedoof day than all of the 25th anniversary yeah yeah not wrong and yeah wrong shame on you for bringing that up like they really look i i'm not saying bedoof day was bad but i am saying they put a lot into this day will july 1st be badoofday for all eternity going forward yeah i don't see why not why not i mean why not it's it's the world we deserve not the one that we want true true they they just really it i mean it wasn't bad it was good it was like a good day it was it was cute but like the joke like it was sort of hard to be like it's a one note joke that was kind of funny back when they did it for april fools and it's back again so they could test the branching event they put into pokemon go that they're going to use for go fest so like it was a cute way to sort of test to make sure things worked uh for go and then everywhere else was just like yeah it's bidoof day because why the heck not let's just go all in it's it says bedoof day on the google cal for the entire pokemon company because that's how they plan all the events at the same time and uh let's just go for it it it's it was fine if as it didn't make really any sense and it was just like okay is this actually going anywhere and the answer is no it's just there we we have to point out that the song that they created for the day of every like from the pokemon company pokemon company international official song about a pokemon that has ever been made this is absolutely the worst the lowest amount of effort was put into i mean yes i like the song they tried to rick roll everybody that was cute but could you not have put half an ounce of energy towards writing lyrics lyrics were so i would rather watch a two-hour video of where is magnemite here is magnemite where is magnemite here is magnesium right then that when which when you write the lyrics to the magikarp being the saddest pokemon you you've already set the bar too high and they just can't do it anymore that magic part is incredible every month they had tons of time to plan for badoofday it's been on the calendar could they not have hired a fantastic lyricist i i think the okay i think the b do song was fine let me listen this is everything angry because i time from my life was taken as i sat and watched the entire thing saying there's there's got to be something better so they did b doof and pokemon go they had a very in my opinion okay i'm already getting sidetracked the bedoof and go having bidoof spawn having pedufan raids even five-star raids um and this specifically i think that questline was so clever and funny and i enjoyed it a lot compared to like the roasted berries of tepig uh or the um just the community day stuff like with that like i think as a hardcore pogo player there's no reason not to buy the dollar community stuff because you're already out and the things you get from it are worth it you get the incense you get the star piece you get the rocket radar like you're a hardcore player you're probably going to use all these items so it is definitely worth the dollar to get the star dust and the experience and the extra like it's fine but most people like i i i am sure that person exists you're not a hardcore player greg don't give me those side eyes how many pokemon have you powered up a lot because i have to do it for things i'm just saying i i did not but i did what did not buy the dollar uh this time around i skipped it i think the dollar is always worth it if you're planning on playing like the entire six hours you're already dedicating so much of your time to this game you might as well spend the dollar and get more value out of it in my opinion that being said i am sure there are some people out there although probably very rare that want to have that little story line and i think sometimes the story line is cute of like the gimbal like biting your ankles or whatever but it's but it's also i would probably imagine for most people they just skip through the storyline i do and i know i can just go to sarah b or wherever and i can just like reread the storyline if i'm ever like okay what happened here like it's documented forever but the bidoof storyline was so cute and so good that you didn't want to skip it and they even take it a little fur they took it a little further and they're like okay you got two dramatic choices here and they were like and it was like you you like clicked on one and then you went back because you wanted to click on the other and it was just very charming and i want that expect like i want that to those dollar community like i want to be i want it to be good enough where i stop to actually read it um well i read the community day one and at the end was very offended because classic professor willow asked me to do a ton of work and then he's like all right thanks i'm going to this picnic sorry you're not invited go about go on about your business don't you're not you can't come to this picnic that you just did all the work for great also commentary on the badoo special research i didn't even finish number one so we're adding this to the stack of special researches that will live uncompleted in my pokemon go account for months and years to come think of it this way well now when you see a bidoof you're like oh my gosh me too but i never step closer i never see a bidoof well now you will get excited when you see one yeah it'll be like whoa one step closer to completing okay so they did the do thing and go uh i'm gonna give them credit here if you log into pokemon trading card game online this app is hanging together by threads here any moment it can break and fall apart it could collapse at any moment but if you logged in between july 1st to july 7th you get like a little b doof deck box and a b doof coin and b do sleeves please do more of this like stop forgetting that this client exists if you're doing a slowpoke day if you're doing a magikarp day if you're doing a bidoof day for celebrating pikachu rockstar this app needs to be part of the celebration and they did it this time i got huge props for that log into your pokemon training card game online get your b doof sleeves for free they did a b do thing in masters although very simple you just get bonus gems for logging in um i think log in bonus you get three login bonuses but they give you seven days to do it very generous so if you're listening to this podcast log and your masters get your be duped gems they did a bunch of merch on pokemon center um they had like three shirts they had a hat they had like a little sign they had a plush uh to me nothing really stood out but i'm sure for those who truly love be dupe i'm sure they were very excited that's cool though um they did be do fun pokemon tv no one really cares about that much that stuff that much but hey if you want to watch b dupe episodes they did that the coolest thing they probably did beside well they did the rick roll thing whatever um the coolest thing they probably did was they partnered with a independent artist through mondo merch and they did a b doof poster that was like 50 that you could pre-order um and let me see if that was still up because they said it was limited so it was by nicole gustafan and it was through mondoshop.com and it says we are beyond excited to celebrate b-dup day july 1st working with the pokemon company has been a dream for years and being one of the first north american companies to collaborate on a project like this is an unbelievable honor we have teamed up with nicole gustafon to release a gorgeous limited edition art print featuring most one of the most lovable pokemon to roam the central region bedoof it will be a limited time offer from midnight uh to july 5th so act fast and it will it's a screen printed poster of 18 by 24 printed by lady lazarus art by nicole um it will ship in october and it will ship to africa australia canada european union i what the heck does that even mean uh middle east and united states what is the what is the european union what where is that wow what does that mean is that all of europe are you is that like france oh my word please stop stop now let's end the train wreck no we already talked about trains earlier with indonesia my word well let's put it this way okay al right now knows nothing of the european union what's the european union have you never seen a blue flag with a circle of gold yellow stars flying over one of the eu embassies no obviously wait you've been to dc i don't remember that i just remembered your apartment being very dirty uh there's an entire website about the eu brexit was all about britain leaving the eu it's a whole thing if you want to talk to al about it have you ever heard of a currency called the euro the european where do you think that comes from i did check the b dupe poster is still available for pre-order it ends at midnight on july 5th so if you're listening to this on monday if you want to be do poster it's 50 bucks it's like 15 a ship by the way uh it's very cute it is cute that was the thing i got from bdoof day i think it's awesome and very cool that the pokemon company partnered with mondo and um an independent artist got to do artwork officially and this says game freak on it and it says the pokemon company and it says nintendo and it is an official poster done by s with a collaboration very cool i the only thing that i'm coming away from b doof day is everything you've done here do this for all of your events yeah partner with people acknowledge the pokemon trading card game online make your go events like you did with the b dupe make them charming like this like keep doing what you did here this is my takeaway from b doof day uh so very i was overall very happy with b doof day canada came out of nowhere they kind of beat a dead horse with it they really did but overall i would say it was a it was a success um it was it was a fun day to be a pokemon fan also the most work they probably did compared to the last six months yeah i mean it felt like they were actually doing something major it's just it was like and you just limited it to be like i think what frustrates me is like it was a glimpse of what they could have been doing this entire year maybe for the 25th anniversary be doing going forwards hopefully more to look forward to i mean i'm that is my hope but i will tell you we are at the start of july and they have stomped all hope out of my heart i will say update as of this recording all three be duped t-shirts sold out the play mats sold out the hat and the plush are still pre-order they wouldn't ship anyways the sign sold out um so yeah i mean they did something right i guess the one thing that i feel like we don't talk about enough on the show is in japan they get new merch like every two weeks uh and pokey jungle is a really good account to follow uh because they'll tweet all the new merch but like that's not a new thing they have been doing this for a decade like a decade and when you're in a pokemon center in japan and you see all that merch and you go back like a month later it's all different like they they're just cycling out merch consistently and it does very very well here we like if you if you're a new listener if you haven't listened to our older shows we've talked about this before but the pokemon company is very profitable and you would think maybe it's because of go or you would think maybe it's because of you know the main series games like sword shield or let's go or heart goals or silver it's not their money comes from merch they are a merch machine 60 of all their revenue i think it's a little higher i think it's like 64 of all their revenue is merchandise and i feel like the trend this year for america is they are catching up and i feel like every week they are putting something new on pokemon center.com even if it's one or two things that i i really thought when they launched pokemon center.com like two years ago that it was gonna be dead in the water after like three months here's a bunch of stuff here's a bunch of plushes we're never gonna update it everything's sold out uh and there was like a small period where like they weren't updating it and everything was kind of sold out but now they're just pumping out much like every week i feel like pokemon center has something new and it's like there are some things exclusive to our pokemon center compared to japan like japan doesn't get these ceramic figures that they keep or resin figures that they keep pumping out and we don't get a lot of like the japanese stuff like they got like a sinister teapot which was cool or a polti guys teapot i should say and we may get that like we get some of the japan stuff like six months after like they get their sitting cuties well in advance before us like they have all gen three sitting cuties i don't think we're there yet with gen three sitting cuties um but yeah the the pokemon center is is is like i feel like this money making machine even in a time where like you know sword shield's almost two two years old it's a little long in the tooth a little long in the tooth but man they they have their hands in so many pots is that an expression hands in the pots no no no sure just just you look you've already defeated me many times this show so i've recovered from the eu thing so sure whatever you want i'm still thinking about bear tick from last week honestly good old bear tick uh anyways uh final bit of news here is that they're doing kind of irl pokemon go stuff and we'll we'll end with this we don't spend too much time on it but this is off pokemon go live uh they say pokemon go fest news doesn't stop we're excited to announce a real world pokemon go fest celebration that will be held in 20 cities this year uh this is up for you know some people are excited some people are not excited i understand both arguments yeah some people are confused uh that's consistent on the show uh we can't gather at the scale of the previous pokemon go events uh these outdoor socially distance experience will certainly be worth attending if you're nearby don't worry the pokemon go fest 2021 in-game experience will be the same for everyone however trainers who attend the in person can look forward to enjoying photo opportunities as they explore the city please note that these real world celebrations are scheduled for saturday 10 to 6 and will not happen on sunday as you plan your weekend please adhere to local policy guidelines and restrictions regarding travel in-person celebrations for the united states are san francisco denver atlanta chicago indianapolis new york city nashville austin seattle and dc for europe it is uh linz uh dr dresden essen hamburg hambur hamburger uh civilia paris warsaw bristol edenburg liverpool and london and for asian pacific it is wow actually no japanese cities it is auckland did i say that right auckland yeah he didn't say a lot of things in europe right but it's fine we're just going to move on you hate that's a parasite essen yeah as i said right bristol liverpool come on i got like [Applause] [Laughter] and it's ludon okay [Music] let me finish the press release if you want to join in these celebrations you must you must register via the link this is off pokemongolive.com or through the events section in the app registration is free spots are limited first come first serve uh please attend the in person experience only if you confirmed registration if you're unable to register please help keep crowd sizes at reasonable and safe levels note an in-game go fest ticket will not grant you admission to these real world celebrations if you live in one of these cities above but not able to register don't worry you still can still participate in go fest in your home city we can't wait for you to experience the musical adventure that is go fest no matter where you play we hope that this year event can make your favorite places feel extra special and then they say like make sure you follow guidelines and stuff okay so the complaint here is probably more so focused to europe since their vaccine rollout is not as quick as the united states and they have had a increase in cases with the delta variant yes but they also i mean there is an application to the us too which was that throwaway line at the beginning of like please follow travel guidance for the locations because i like i know dc if you are coming to dc from another state you are supposed to quarantine for 14 days yep so like don't show up at dc the day before and expect to go to this event because you're not welcome okay but i feel like we have to talk about the event itself it's just yes photo op it's yeah it's it's like but they didn't give any detail right yeah so my so when i asked giant okay so you okay so when i talked to niantic and i said i just like are these players getting anything that other players are not getting are they getting better spawns are they getting you know more gifts from pokestops they just told me that it is just the photo opera you just get the exclusive picture they're saying that it is a physical photo op but players will not receive anything in in game or real life it is literally just a picture opportunity yes that's all it is that makes sense so possibly a food truck congregated nearby that you could purchase food items from so just like everything covered related this was probably planned a while ago when things were looking good it probably didn't seem too terrible to set up right i don't know how i don't know how complicated or how hard it is to make however many photo opportunities stands we don't even know what they look like they're probably it's probably like mellowetta and galerion zigzagoon or something some sort of like maybe like a band shell like where a performance uh would be and it's like maybe you can stand in the band shell and look like you're on stage with meluetta or something weird like that they gotta so what 25 cities or something they they hire 25 people off craigslist or whatever to stand there to look at your phone no well no no that's like a real thing like i don't know if people know this but like when nintendo does their like pop-up booths at like mall of america or mayfair they literally just get people off craigslist and they pay them like 25 dollars an hour and they say like this is like a three-day gig and that's it and they sign an nda and they they show people how to play like wii sports and then they like move on like that's like what they do um because they're going from city to city so they need local people to run these booths and they like walk away with a free nintendo shirt and like 500 bucks so they're setting up 25 booths you're you have to register to even like stand in a line you go you get up there you take a picture and then you're done that's like it right i don't think personally i understand i totally understand the concern but i don't think it's like that big of a deal like it's an outside take a picture that that is your day and then you're done like there's nothing else to do there yeah and what the concern is that they they aren't implying like if you're unable to write like so when we went to go fast people just walked into the park like there wasn't a person that stopped you and checked your ticket it's just that things that activated so i think what people's fear of is looking at past events more people that have tickets potentially will show up and attempt to do the thing that they aren't going to be able to do and in past events niantic did not have gatekeeping they did not have a good way they relied completely on the app of doing that and since this is not detailed on the website there is concern that there are a number of people who are just going to show up and make this more potentially dangerous than it needs to be um for a photo op and they're sort of walking this line of fear of misting out but also be safe it's just like i mean like they say like don't worry the pokemon go fest experience will be the same for everyone around the world like like it's almost like these press releases need like an faq but i think the problem is like no one would read it like i i had i went to niantic i got clarification that it's literally just some standee that you will be able to take a picture in front of which is cool if you're in that city totally cool um you know but i would i would assume for most people they're they're not going to be like oh i live in kenosha wisconsin i'm going to drive down to chicago because i want a picture with mellowetta i'm sure i'm sure one of the or two or three of those people exist yes um but i don't think the vast majority of like fans are gonna be like oh it's just oh it's just a photo opportunity okay i don't have to go to chicago but to be fair if you live in kenosha i would say maybe you should go to chicago because it's a better place to play than kenosha like there's just more gyms more stops more spawns because it's just because the spawns and everything are based on cell phone traffic there's just so many people in chicago it's a great city to play at um well i think i think honestly i'm developing a new rule for 2021. follow it if you wish don't follow it if you don't wish but here's will anderson's rule for 2021 do the things that you're comfortable doing don't complain about people doing things that you are not comfortable doing done do it if you want to don't do it if you don't i just leave it there this is a lot i could say about this it's it is it is what it is i don't i don't i'm not behind niantic's many choices currently so i don't think this is the worst but i understand the concern i don't want to sound like it's like if i was in if i was going to chicago would i sign up for this photo opportunity yes i would if i was going to chicago which was a which was a thought we talked about on the show like are we going to go to chicago this year uh and if this was in minneapolis would we the three of us sign up for this i think i would yeah yeah um but i don't know what the situation like are they gonna have a person standing there saying like okay everyone's six feet apart yeah like i mean like if if those questions were answered i think people would feel i think the people who have concerns and your concerns are 100 valid 100 valid uh i think people would then feel better but like i don't know i i like what what does this look like it's almost like what if they had a picture of like this is what the photo opera looks like this is what the line looks like if you want to sign up cool hey don't worry though if you're in uh if you're in uh san antonio don't drive an hour to austin maybe it's an hour and a half because it's not worth it right i think i think the problem is is they are still putting out press releases with limited details in a situation where we need better details to make more informed decisions given the state of the world and i think what frustrates me and a lot of other people is the fact that they want to they want it always and people are going to make ill-informed decisions because you have not provided them the proper amount of information and it is not hard to provide that information like again if you had a like i said if there's a picture of what the plan is like this is what the photo op is this is what we're planning because you know they've had to have it to plan it because they've had to have this i don't know there's certain amounts that you just can't plan for yeah but you know what your setup is going to be if you're going into the city and saying hey we're going to set this up you have talked to them at least a month in advance okay but this is the other thing i don't get maybe it tells you when you sign up i didn't sign up chicago's a big city where is this stand this where where am i going where am i going i think it doesn't tell you until you sign up yes like where like is there just one is there two is there four yeah like is there one person working it is there five people working it is it gonna be roped off did like like did chicago pay for this did niantic pay chicago like what yeah it's just like i get there's a lot of parties involved there's a lot of different cities there's the pokemon company there's niantic this was probably planned for a while they had to go to some company to build some of these standees that they got laying around and you know maybe they built the standees and they were like oh we're going to take a huge loss on these standees because we were hoping covid was going to be solved by it then and maybe we can try to get some of our money back by partnering with atlanta but again like denver atlanta chicago indianapolis new york these are huge cities where where are you going what is happening well calling indianapolis a huge city is a bit of a stretch it's very spread out it is very spread out i would assume that the indianapolis one would like my assumption is like the chicago one is probably by the the bean the indianapolis one is probably buy that giant roundabout statue with the fountain that would be my guess austin is probably by 17 food trucks yes that is basically the perfect description of all of austin it's i i i it's so hard because i i see i see like okay if you're in the city if you're playing go safely it's outside this is like a fun probably ten minute thing out of your day like people like you're not going to stand there for an hour you're getting a picture and you're moving on so like yeah this seems fun and then i see the other side of like why even do this like i see both sides um i don't know in the audio podcast i'm throwing my hands up i don't know i i i don't have a good answer it's it's it's a test for future go fest to see if they can hold a physical event in multiple cities very simple version of it next year it'll be more advanced yeah anyways question of the week greg all right hold on i'm exhausted from that conversation all right oh question of the week pulled from youtube and slack yes there was a bunch of stuff you guys really knocked out of the park with uh uh tone chris catherine wait which andrew alex chris christie chris uh lot lots of news this week so there's there's there's me acknowledging your names uh in the attic channel but thank you for sending stuff in where's our question of the week i just lost it i had it then i lost it way up at the top oh yeah cause the piplup came right below the bdoof uh uh picture thing you guys are having a lot of fun in the attic channel you're in it i am not actually not al says b dupe question mark brandon says if you have to make a game around b doof what would it be tone says pokemon legends b do fun b doof is already on the cover of legends yeah b diff is in legends it is already all about be diff uh it would be a tap a beat of chopping through wood a cookie thing how much cookie clicker yeah a bit of cookie cooker chewing through logs how much done could there be a b doof like one of those runny escape things where it's beautiful swimming down oh like temple yeah front beat of river run or uh uh be do frogger oh what is he trying to dodge i mean he's got to get across the highway and then you gotta get across the river yeah and there's for alligator in that river speaking of games this is from tom from our youtube some of y'all asking look i love our youtube comments they're very nice and humble at least in the podcast episodes they're very nice boy my youtube shorts you get some wild comments on those uh some of y'all writing paragraphs though which is very nice we're gonna do an easy one this week this is from tom says stepping away from maine title games do you have any ideas for spin-off pokemon games that haven't been from here in england thank you tom i am still 100 behind a pokemon tower defense game i feel like power defense is so 2012. they are still making them they're still fun do you and they're still fun are we going back to clash royale no that's not tower defense that's yeah tower chess i still want a pokemon racing game like legit actually pokemon racing game like a mario kart where they're in cars yeah yeah yeah okay like pikachu in a car well i would be yeah because so you could like the problem with pokemon is an erasing concept is just some pokemon are naturally faster and then like something can fly and some can only swim so like if you had a vehicle that was like oh pikachu driving a swanna vehicle but then you could change out the pikachu to be like oh he's in now the pikachu's in like a giggleth vehicle because gigoloth could never race he's too slow he's slow but even if it was like i would just be super happy if it was just they put link in isabel and mario kart why can't we just have like squirtle that's squirtle war turtle like that that would probably literally not old enough to drive no satisfy my my itch for the the pokemon mario kart kind of situation what if they put uh a mario party pokemon game so no this is what i was thinking dr evie which is similar to dr mario where things drop in and you've got to match them and not fill up the thing but if you get the correct evolution order sequencing then the pokemon evolves and you get abilities that assist with your doctor evie yeah i like that so like a pokemon tetris type version or pokemon puyo puyo or etc trying to think of what else i mean they did a pokemon fighting game that was pretty cool yeah uh let me bring back pokemon ranger i do i do i do like the the mario party situation yeah they kind of did that with animal crossing but they messed it up yeah they we should do a non-messed up pokemon version a pokemon portal like a hyper realistic first person puzzle game where you have to somehow incorporate pokemon to escape the rooms and solve the puzzles um like detective pikachu after dark for adults they could literally take the 14 games from stadium one and the 14 games from stadium and then just add a bunch of new games that are literally reskins of like instead of catching digletts you're catching uh patrats or watch hogs that pop up you remember the ekans you like pull back the airplanes you get you just change it out for like watch hogs um they could just like reskin or they could just make a couple new ones and they could add a board yeah like even if the board part was bad uh which it probably would be people would just be like oh i can play stadium mini games on switch that's like like yeah well they would just buy it because they like like that those mini those mini games were pretty good each stage is a gym and you are collecting badges from the gym leaders instead of stars oh i said oh i see you were going back to the board game party yes mario party stadium did have gym leaders yeah but like if so if like it was pokemon party and each board was a gym and instead of stars you got badges and you moved your pokemon around the gym and then all the media games from stadium and all the other ones are the things you fight against each other sold done easy check please nintendo hey you know it's 25th anniversary they could surprise us with uh a brand new game later this year probably not that's not how they work that's not what's going to happen stop getting your hopes up this has been a terrible anniversary we had could be worse could be worse could be worse uh he was going to be much better five months left of the year uh will give us a pokemon of the week all right so the pokemon from last week uh as one that i got newly added to my pokedex in pokemon go by completing a what five month old special research that originally had required that you battled jesse and james but since jesse and james aren't in the game anymore had been subsequently edited um the uh this pokemon had been added to pokemon go on may 17 2019 but cannot be caught in eggs or uh in the wild you have to use a mossy lure on a pokestop which you know everybody who visited the art park yesterday you're welcome for all of the inappropriate lures that i placed up magnets we put up ice we put up mossy and specifically one of the premium blurs oh yeah uh specifically in pokemon go it can evolve into one of two final forms because for whatever reason its second evolution is basically in pokemon go considered as almost like two different pokemon um so for those of you who guessed the final evolution you obviously weren't paying attention when i said that this pokemon can evolve but yes that's very specific to go how it works in other pokemon games is very different okay the more than enough information who is it it's zig zagoon yeah it's cherubi ruby is that cherry this it doesn't matter it's disturbing have you ever read the pokedex entry uh the shuffle is gorgeous uh the shiny is okay it's just weirdly lighter and i'm not a fan you know how cherubi has that like second head hanging off the pokedex entry i think it's the pokemon go does pokemon go have pokedex entries no no somewhere somewhere it's basically says that trueby stores nutrients in that second head and then like uses them and i'm like oh why why does it have to have a face then it nimbly dashes about to avoid getting pecked by bird pokemon that would love to make off with its small nutrient-rich storage ball yes with a face with a face is there maybe it's like maybe it's like a decoys like the birds will take that one and the main body will get away like dogs that have like the the little marks above their eyes yeah which are not eyebrows they're so that when the dog is sleeping it looks like their eyes are still open mm-hmm uh no there's no trivia dang tribby seems to be based on a cherry oh my gosh that's it's trivia all right what about next week here we go in the popular home video game series known as super smash bros period ultimate two of the playable characters derived from sibling nintendo based home video game series pokemon sun and pokemon moon can be said to be to potentially share a career this week's pokemon's up special move unlike many other super smash bros period ultimate playable characters up special moves does not leave the pokemon helpless but is dangerous to use on stages where falling off the side is a possibility as it requires preparing for the landing location before you initiate the move [Laughter] i loves me some smash bros period ultimate you do not you have never played it once you you outsourced for your no no no no no no no it's fortunately i'm like the crouton floating in the bowl of tomato soup where the tomato soup is i'm constantly surrounded by people playing
