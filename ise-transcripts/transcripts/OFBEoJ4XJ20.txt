[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 397 Thep asone of the pokemon podcast it's super effective we have a heck of a show for you guys I said I introduced myself I'm just thinking about doctrine gonna show already huh Zuko how daunting this is I'm your host SBJ with me Gregg hello remind me I have a quick GTS PSA to give everybody when it's my shot okay and well also here I have no PSAs I love everything everything is great Irv is a wonderful world all right good you probably can figure out by the episode title that there's an interview this episode with dr. lava they are the twitter / youtuber that posts old pokemon history and we talked a little bit about that stuff with like Goro Chu which was supposed to be the evolution ride shoe and the Gen 4 sprite female male leaks a couple episodes back kind of more in depth of you know how he came across this information what he actually does with the information you know going forward so that'll be in the middle of the episode and it was it was a great interview okay we got a jam-packed show for you guys so we're gonna go through the stuff there's certain news articles I didn't pull I'm sure you I saw it by at the start well well let's just jump right in the news there there's a new episode of Twilight wings that podcast oh good well listen to that in the patreon feed I will save my opinions for it speaking of controversy that's good let's talk about a different controversy for it let's talk about a different controversy this is egg events that have made up the last couple things in Pokemon go the egg-cellent egg events yes think the sulfur road did some research and what how did they how did they frame this we're not gonna do it anymore well no no not that they like calculated the amount of days it's like January well since the start of the year and how many of those days had events and out of those days that had event since the year started like 77% of them involved egg events I think it was 48 out of 62 days had egg events yes yes there you go so that's a lot of egg events and we've complained on the show about how the egg events seemed awful and and other people have also complained and then we decided to start a petition hashtag bring back no egg events know that I'm just kidding that didn't happen that I did so the controversy that they changed it apparently this is this is the controversy I guess this is the issue is the antek came out and told third party sources that they've changed it and they said to these third party sources such as like trainer tips or some other youtubers or some other sources of media that the the starters the clone starters that are we're going to be available in 7k eggs will now also be available in one-star raids a great start they have also said they plan on redoing events in the future based off what they've heard about the complaints for all these egg events which is that's all good that's all great my problem is you can't actually find the antics saying this you can only find like youtubers repeating that like we've talked to Manta can they said oh and we saw this before with Darumaka where they said we're knee antic said don't worry after Darmok is out of 7k eggs it will appear in the wild but they never posted an official statement about that they told I think like an Instagram person and then the Instagram person told us and then back a couple months ago suddenly gibble shiny gibble was available but again they didn't tell anyone except they told an instagramer and the Instagram person told us I get that knee antic is working with youtubers and influencers not us because I think we're too negative we don't influence we could be come on I mean we can change with make an offer there's there's a couple things one is like why are they not just they they have they can push us news in the app they have a website that we go to and report on they have their own Twitter account which we've gotten news from before when they reply to people but they seem to rely on aaniin influencers that one not everyone follows and if you're going to tell like the gibble and the the gibble is a good example they only told one influencer and it wasn't until very much later on the other influencers just piggybacked off that initial influencer but we don't even know what influencers they work with and i feel like that should be disclosed like i work like if nintendo sends me a free game not only do i have to include hashtag free game in my tweet and i have to include hashtag free game if i'm streaming it on twitch but there was like one time i forgot about it and nintendo like messaged me and they were like you're that we were like they were like hey just a heads up out of your four videos this one doesn't have the hashtag in it can you update that video and I was like oh yeah I'm super sorry like that was an accident because sometimes I changed my when I'm streaming on Twitch sometimes I'm changing games and then I'm changing the type the title and then twitch only remembers one of your multiple titles that you have and then when D it with DNA you know any time we bring up Pokemon master news it's just very easy to say like hey I specifically work with DNA but I've I have like no clue which influencers are working with me antic I don't know where to find that information who I don't get why any anti geared is are they like doing it so they don't have like any responsibilities of like if the SHINee gable broke they could be like well you know we never officially said it gives some plausible deniability I guess but in kind of a terrible way that's the whole universe of possible can I have anything is a terrible way yes you don't use plausible deniability for good things well the good news out of all of this is if you don't want to buy incubators and you want to get these starters those Lonestar the clone starters they will also be available in raids which I said this before I would rather spend a dollar ensuring I'm getting a Pokemon that I'm writing said dollar for and some spending how much is an incubator either a dollar fifty or two dollars for three random chances of who knows what probably leftover Luvdisc from the Valentine's Day event for the amount of money that the three of us have cumulatively put into Pokemon go I honestly think that we should be the influencers yeah and then we'll stop complaining about them using other influencers yeah I mean oh I know well just stop complaining if you give me free stuff well the ante has paid for us to go to go fest before when not not not all of us so not all of us I see where I am pecking order a bunch of crap I'm not saying I don't like the people some of the people who are on the show but - before that Pokemon good news I'm just saying that I feel like there probably is some legal gray area that knee antic is avoiding with a lot of stuff right now true and if the people from play Rick's would like me to say positive things about garden scapes I did start putting money into your game so my ears are up in friends why are you playing that game I love it it's sick I mean it's sick speaking of sick yes Funko pops are the greatest thing ever I'm so happy that everybody out there has the opportunity get them can we just become a Funko podcast because week it look that cubone has turned me Funko positive I hate that word a lot oh the one facto positive yeah I think the Pikachu is cuter a peach is very cute but Atta was real cute too I don't know the huge frittata or pea Japan but that Cuban though yeah that is all of it so I'm sold on Franken berry Morton Salt girl and cubone like you're winning me over so this was this came out of the New York Toy Fair how which I feel like didn't get that much coverage the last year or also last year but maybe I'm just maybe that's on me the I think that's on you okay but the Toy Fair was held February 22nd to the 25th it's actually still going on as of this recording but they showed off another four new Funko pops which is another Pikachu so I think they're up to three or four Funko Pikachu's at this point growlithe icky bone and a Rattata they will also be doing a 10-inch version of Mewtwo which will be exclusive to target for $29.99 and this is to follow the but they have done Bulbasaur Charmander squirtle they did Eevee and then earlier this month they announced me to mr. mime Vulpix and Pichu and out of I didn't recognize I didn't realize this but still kind of arrow pointed this out the only Jen to Pokemon out of this was Pichu otherwise everything so far has been genuine I mean that's no surprise I mean hello relay Gnaeus yeah we sure do I mean this eight they're gonna go the Pokemon go route and sudden the people I'd be like I mean when's Gen 5 coming like they're still in Gen 1 they're gonna milk this till 2050 is there I mean I'm trying to think of like a series that has like a lot of characters and they actually did every character I think Harry Potter had a lot of fun goes the Golden Girls Hillary yeah my favorite Hillary Hillary I really loved Bianca Samantha and Joanne those are my yeah or favorite or the best i I don't know that they've done every character of one series like I think they've done the main characters of one series but I don't think there's like a Moaning Myrtle Funko oh I know they did they did the like what's his name Dean the like Harry Potter is only black Moaning Myrtle Harry Potter's one black friend yeah they do that we're gonna avoid what controversy and walk is the others what I'm hearing right now list of Harry Potter Funko Wow they literally have on the Funko or I guess it's off the Funko site a Harry Potter shop that is only Harry Potter holy cow there's a lot of Harry Potter Funko's there's oh there's a chess set that's that's not fun no but there's a Viktor Krum Yule Ball Funko what oh there is it's really bad there's a Cho Chang there's a there's multiple uh Harry Potter's of course multiple run of cars there's a Malfoy with a whip spider I don't know what that means Quidditch Draco Malfoy from Hot Topic only there's the you could just get a basket liske as a Harry Potter figure sure you got mad guy Budhia I remember let me just say they've done almost every important character in Harry Potter looking at this list so that's what I'm worried about Pokemon because if if if Game Freak has enough audacity to put both qwilfish and Murr actus into sword and shield then I would imagine that Funko has enough audacity to make a bar budge figure look if Funko doesn't make it dunce if they don't make it done sports they better quit now frauds like Mammon floor now long wine I'm you can get it from me for my 100th birthday there's a lot of Harry Potter Funko's I am still scrolling on this page I found are you on cardboard connection calm I am hotter shop calm I am only at Dolores Umbridge number 39 there's two hagwons oh one what is flocked and one is unlocked I see there's a hermit I could never say her name her moaning or my any or my my Annie there's one of her as a cat yeah that's an important plot point the Polyjuice potion went wrong right in in three years this podcast is us going to be it's just us talking about which which Pokemon Funko's were missing and they're only gonna be up to like Gen 2 and it's gonna be like glow-in-the-dark Dunsparce only available at KB Toys in Canada man I'm there road trippin to KB Toys Canada it's not that hard to get to Canada from we're not saying road trippin I'll be my first time to Canada I bet alright yes I have not been to Canada don't say I didn't say it you you didn't have to I could hear the typing sword and shield TCG set just came out if you're thinking about getting into the Pokemon Trading Card Game both will and I will advise you not to but if you decide that you hate money the sword shield just came out or anything is anything good ah there's a Cramer it but is it good ah it was good until this past weekend now it's not good anymore this weekend they released some promos oh the Oceania championships in Australia happened oh and nobody played Cara Maria no the people who did play Kramer aunt lost Kramer aunt has a four three colorless energy can do 160 damage to any Pokemon on the bench or not which is very good people run to den agx but they never use it to attack they just run D it did n AG X for the ability and so did n AG X has ironically 160 HP and if you knock it out it gives you two prizes so what what the thought process was is I will put one creme around in my deck and when I only need to knock out one more GX come on and or take two prizes I will drop the creamer and move the energy snipe the dedenne win the game that didn't happen no that didn't have if you only have one of a card in your deck is you will never see it Pokemon TCG is still just shuffle everything until I get what I want right I mean that's how you play the game shuffle shuffle shuffle shuffle and then maybe I'll get what I want search shuffle search shuffle shuffle shuffle sorcerer search I love the pokemon TCG you are so full of baloney I love it it has ups and downs X&Y definitely a Down Sun and Moon definitely an up until the end ascendant moon that was definitely that this is just crime ranch vCard is just the crime rant be yeah it looks it looks like he's coming out of the square yeah although there's two is there cream are not V no the other one is just the alternative art okay no art where's this one where he's just standing at a shoreline it's just a that's nice we will just grammar a we call that filler just like how Cameron was Pokemon killing mmm bring it the controversy bring it the heat I am assuming the only reason they announced this so early but this is a lot earlier than they've ever announced it is because the the the Toy Fair but they've already announced the expansion to sword and shield which is called rebel clash and off the press release here it says dozens of recently discovered Pokemon from gallery make their way to the trading card game in the next expansion rebel clash releasing around the world on May first available in booster packs theme decks elite trainer boxes and special collections sword and shield rebel clash will continue to introduce new Pokemon V and Pokemon VMAX such as toques tricity v-max based on Giganta max hawks tricity in addition trainers will look forward to adding the following key cards to their TCG collection 16 pokemon v such as toxicity v double v Bolton v in Santa Conda v+ 14 full arts of pokemon v7v max Pokemon will be included in the final evolutions of the first starter of the first partner Pokemon of Galler as well as kapa Raja v-max and drag appleton v-max 15 trainer cards and 4 full art supporter cards and 4 new special energy cards will be included in the set I don't know if they said how many cards total I want to say I read somewhere it was like a hundred and seventy oh man I know that's a lot how many rosaries are in there zero man I don't think they've maybe they did printer Rose raid they were probably more than plenty of Rosa raid cards in the past there has been there should be Electro's raids there should be some that are playable now alright Pokemon masters news here full disclosure I am partnered with DNA will and Greg not partnered with DNA full disclosure I saw that somebody data leaked the game yeah I heard about that so there's like a lot of characters that I guess were shown we're not I'm we're just gonna talk about the news here it does you're more than welcome to a couple months ago DNA apologized that the game wasn't fun and they did this like six month roadmap and they said that this this month would include news stories this month would include news stories etc etc and they've really stuck to that to a tee I don't think they were late on anything they originally promised in that roadmap so the first one being that there are that on February 24th there will be three new chapters of the story being added chapters 22 through 24 and it looks like you will be able to get Valerie I don't know if they've actually revealed her pokemon yet what game is she from Valerie I'm not Valerie oh geez everyone know whenever Valerie she's from X&Y she's the fashion designer right the fashion designer that has the she she's in the coolest town in x and y but the problem with her her gym is it was just a copy and paste from Sabrina's gym weight she's the fairy gym yes yeah she's a fairy Joe okay with all the kimono ladies yes the fashion house is the fashion design house in the Jin her gym she had mall while mr. mime and sylveon it's gonna be sylveon but didn't they release to the Japanese Twitter of it she was with Sylvia as of this podcast we can reveal that it is Sylvia I predicted it right yeah so her sake Paris thought of Sylvia and I'm pretty sure besides Mina and grand bull this is the second fairy sinker they're adding to the game alright second bit of news here is that there is an update to the app and they've changed some things in the update sync Paris can now be used sync Paris can now use a new feature known as lucky skills sync pairs level caps have been adjusted the amount of XP acquired in some areas have been increased area detailed view can now be seen in all areas that contain battles sync pairs that appear and their types and weaknesses can now be viewed an area detail they fix the bug we're in a rare occasion specific circumstance um of the AI and they have done some minor bug fixes and improvements so update your app there is a whole thing about what I just mentioned they changed some of the level cap levels for specific six pairs we don't know we don't need to go through the whole list it's pretty long but they've changed it so it's ideally easier to level up your current characters the big news here is if you missed it maybe you just got into Pokemon masters the mu-2 and Giovanni are coming back well thank goodness because I miss fat to coincide with the new changes with the changes new exchange options will be available and it looks like the item exchange period will begin on March 5th and Giovanni will run from March 5th to March 15th I don't know why you guys didn't tell me that the team break from Pokemon masters is basically Pokemon dual players who got mad cuz their game got canceled so they're invading another game with their masks is is that what they look like in duel I don't remember I mean kind of feel everybody had to wear a mask so team break has like a cool animation though when you battle them how like the their masks slash the be like kind of zooms into the screen yeah how do I haven't really had one team break battle and I didn't notice that it was on the beach I was trying to find a I also just like the concept of they have all the character models in the game and like they just put up masks on them to represent that their team break it's like really kind of dumb but also like I love it so much because it's like much better than this is like older Pokemon games where they would just be like oh I'm part of Team Rocket and they'll like spin around and then they just turned they're like little sprite just turns into a Team Rocket grunt I just think this is like way more funny of just it's an ace trainer boy but let's just put the mask on them or like the hiker with the team break mask is really funny to me spoilers haven't gotten that far today every model has a team break mask I'm pretty sure Greg did you poles Stephen nope so like I don't want to waste all of my gems on trying to get Stephen stone when there are for sure at least three new one coming I think isn't because they've rashon supermodel Alisa Valerie and her sylveon and we know red is in there I don't know if it's in this one but we've seen him yeah that was kind of like the weird thing so I think that that was on the Japanese Twitter so we can talk about Lisa Eliza ally ally I think she I'm almost positive when you grill you pull her she says I'm Ally I think so because like the American one says Cygnus utilize and Rotom are joining the fray and the Japanese one says it's Valerie and Sylvia okay joining the fray yeah so the Rotom one is really weird I just want to talk about this real quick because I really like Eliza and that's my favorite sync pair is that Zeb Stryker in Eliza so like seeing Eliza get a another Pokemon is really cool and I know some people were like oh oh can you are kind of weird but not really because like Oakes gern the reason oak gives red and blue and I guess chase and trace the Pokedex is because he wants to document all the Pokemon but he can't do it yourself and his main goal was to like he like II know I'm pretty I made me a member I yes correct me like he knows MU exists but he's never been able to document it so it when you get this is weird you learn why professor oak has mu by going through his sync story okay I have enough so it's it's very strange because you're introduced to this pair and you're introduced to Professor Oak who's like I want to join your team and this is my partner and then you do a sync story and it's got a completely different partner and at the end of it is like I wanna join your tea even like we've already covered this okay I know you're old but come on oh we've talked about like why doesn't mean I have grandpa land not Rabanne B but I guess you could get a sig signature Cygnus suit but ELISA or Liza doesn't ever hit rook Tom ever I get that her dress looks like Rotom which is really cool that's just really good and she's like she have a wait does she never have not in any of the game so yeah so in in black and white she has a Moga Emolga substrate which i always hate when they give trainers / gym leaders the same Pokemon a mogul bowgasm Tyga's of shreeka the the or maybe in Gen 2 with Morty you know the gen where they introduced new ghost Pokemon like mr. Rivas they gave Marty hunter Hunter hunter gang guy so in black and white - she has Emolga flappy and then zip Strika so perfect they got rid of animo we gave her a flappy and then in challenge mode so if you do the harder black and white - they gave her Emolga flappy Joel tick and zip Strika and then in the world tournament she has zip Strika Ampharos Galvin Chawla Emolga Electress and stunfisk and it's possible that you can match her up and she adds on a luxray and drops the Galvin Sheila so no in in no sense that she ever have a Rotom and I'm not like it's fine like she's an electric gym leader and wrote like it's just you would think that Emolga would come before Rotom as like she always has the Emolga with her as well as somebody more special I don't know of another person who handed on a Moga though somebody electric professor Elmen is Emolga stop your nonsense so ill out of curiosity I guess you downloaded masters yeah you like it so far because I was told for several weeks that I should at least log in and get my gems and whatever that weird comic book looking thing is so I've been doing that oh and well when when do I get to talk about the raids the raids since Pokemon home and how much I love them raid since Pokemon home well let's uh well that was our last night I got my PSA when we talked about this we're gonna take a break we got through all the news pretty reasonably interview with dr. lava then we'll come back and we'll talk about Pokemon home because it's updated multiple times it's good and then a pokemen of the week and question the week not in that order but we will be [Music] [Music] [Music] we are back from our break interview time I am here with dr. lava from lava cut content calm how are you doing good how you doing Steve I'm good I'm good it's funny cuz you were you connected with me like almost a year ago and we are now getting to this so I apologize for the delay that's all good things before a sword and shield were super hectic so that was my bed it's all good I got more interesting stuff to talk about now than I did a year ago anyway that's true your site's really blown up so Before we jump into what we're gonna talk about if somebody has not heard of lava cut content or yourself who are you and what do you do well I'm an evil scientist first and foremost but my spare time I like to kind of guess you'd say catalog Pokemon content content in the traditional sense as well as just sort of unused ideas I also do a lot with kind of beta content and leaks not leaks as far as like what's gonna happen the sword and shield next but like leaks of stuff that beta content from stuff like you know Gen one to four more recently just kind of cuz there have been quite a few leaks of old you know 20 year old Pokemon demos and that kind of thing over the past year or two so yeah japan-exclusive [ __ ] just japan exclusive content cut content also do translations of old japanese developer interviews that kind of thing i noticed you said 1 to 4 is there a reason that gen 3 you just kind of skipped over well there hasn't really been a week of not on the scale of what we've had four one two and four although I do suspect that some stuff from gen 3 will leak one of these days because of that worth what the source of the of the other leaks came from I suspect that the well I guess I was guess we're gonna say this for later bow is go ahead and get into it you know it was a head someone hacked into Nintendo servers back in 2017 got a whole bunch of kind of development assets not just from Pokemon but from a lot of stuff actually but will the stick with Pokemon so the stuff from 1 2 & 4 has been made public at least most of it but nothing from gen 3 yet but I suspect that it was also hacked and just hasn't surfaced yet like the other stuff so the first time we talked about your stuff was just a couple weeks ago it was the Gen 4 leaked hundreds of gendered beta sprites mmm I guess we came with it from like complete transparency we came with it as like we don't know if this is real we don't know if this is false because like in the Pokemon world if it's not on Sara B and some public pedia people just kind of like shrug their shoulders and was like we don't know if this is real or not but you kind of proven over the last well how about almost two years you've been doing this right uh a year and a half something like that yeah it seems like there's a lot of there's a lot of in-depth stuff that you definitely go into but do you still get that from your audience of like why should we believe you um I think most people have followed me for a while have kind of come to accept it the people have read the articles my website of course I'll have random comments from time to time live seems like BS to me but you know the the case is pretty strong and you know that stuff for example that the most well known of the leaks the gold and silver of 1997 demo that's a space broad one right right space world it was the demo exhibited at the space world 1997 Stoffel often referred to as a space world demo but it's not on Bulba pedia but it's my understanding that the I guess non port of directors I forget the exact term but basically the board of directors from Bulba pedia seldomly meets and they they're the ones that would approve that kind of thing being put on Bulba pedia but I've spoken with some Bubba pedia moderators they think space world is true there's been footage that surfaced after the that confirmed what was in the leak and also we've had you know we now know we didn't know this when when space world leaks but we now know the past six weeks or so that the all these leaks including space world came from March 2017 hack of Nintendo servers and that guy was the hacker was caught he was prosecuted you obviously know knows I now report on that stuff but it's not me he's you know breaking into servers and that kind of thing know wouldn't know how to and would want to do it but yeah it's pretty indisputable I would say that these gen 1 2 & 4 leaks are legitimate although the the Gen 1 stuff was kind of confused by some fan-made stuff got mixed in with it but we know what's what's real and what's not and the leaks are legitimate you're doing all this on your own and I'm from my understanding you don't speak Japanese so you have to actually pay translators and stuff so with all of that like what got you into reporting on this stuff because this is something really cool this is something I would have liked I am the person that cares about the the silly difference between like oh this is a mythical this is not a mythical this is right this is how you actually say the pokemons name I like I care about I know most people don't right but I care about that trivia stuff and I like to know the history of how these things happened or how we got to the point or why Game Freak makes the decisions they do well I first started making just some kind of Nintendo cut content I started with Metroid Prime I did Zelda Mario a few other games and then after I did Mario 64 on YouTube I was like you know I'll do pokémon red and blue like probably won't get many views cuz it's like a 25 year old game at this point but you know I guess I'll just make a Pokemon game I like Pokemon I've always loved Pokemon so I made one video about pokemon red and blues cut content and I kind of blew up got you know over 100,000 views which was a lot more than I had been getting so that maybe I'll make one more Pokemon video and they got you know some traction as well and I was like okay well maybe I'll just stay with this for a little while and then you know about a year and a half's come by now and and people seem to care a lot more when I talk about Pokemon tech content than anything else so I kind of stuck with it and you know I've been a big Pokemon fan since I was 10 years old and I used to be really into the card game I went to the World Championships so didn't do very well but big Pokemon fan for a long time and just seemed like there was kind of I guess you could say like a hole in the market there are there are other people doing it I want to shout out some people probably later in this episode there are other people who do it but they're kind of no disrespect to them but kind of splintered and the people who do do it even do a good job don't have the best presentation yeah you know there would be something like an info dump and you know most people would rather see you know a tweets worth of information or YouTube videos worth of information than just have you know pages and pages and pages of sort of like try you know info dump at their fingertips so a lot of what I do is take stuff that was leaked or by other people and then kind of try and condense it into presentable format presentable is is definitely what people look for it sometimes like case in point you know the Pokemon go community they love their infographics and that was just a thing that blew up in that community and like a clean infographic about like that infos out there right like this Pokemon is weak to this and this and this and this and it's gonna show up from 10:00 to 12:00 and it's like you can find that info pretty easily but they love it when it's presented in a P&G 10 by 10 inch thread we're on Twitter or on Instagram and stuff so like presentation goes a long way and and so when you when we hit this Gen 4 leak hundreds of gendered beta sprites this is very easy to follow very easy to read so yeah let's uh let's get into this so this was the one with uh like female Pikachu with the heart tail butt down ears female ride shoe with down ears which that the the ear Park I cut but the tail stayed the same on the Pikachu so yeah we can talk about sort of how happened and I guess more this story of the leak rather than you know describing the ears of all the female variants so I guess I kinda have to start at the end to get back to the beginning so when the you know first there was a space world link leak back in 2018 and then there was a Gen 1 leak which is published by helix chamber and early 2019 and then in this past December there was a gem for beta sprite leak which first leaked on Forge hands VP board not sure if you're familiar but I know for Chan I stay far far away from it well I don't spend too much time on there but they do you know credit where it's where it's due there is a lot of interesting kind of beta Pokemon discussion as well as in this case an actual leak that happens over there on 4chan so you know my honor they they use rude words it's for sure but they do kind of play you know sort of an important part in the Pokemon beta content community I would say but anyway so there was this leak someone posted the who we now know but at the time didn't know who it was posted a link to a web site a weird web site that had hundreds of Gen 4 beta sprites on it and of course everyone on 4chan was you know skeptical of course but it seemed to be legitimate just on the face of it and then it was about 24 hours it was taken offline and I'm getting into contact with the guy who owns that web site that had the beta sprites on it yeah I talked to him and there's some details won't go into but a few days after that that person I talked to you own the website posted I guess you would say a confession I hope I'm not miss character just characterizing it but he did say sorry and kind of tell the truth so I think it's fair to frame it as a confession sure so anyway this the guy who owned the web site the Gen 4 beta sprites were on he posted confession on glitched city which said which basically told the story of how these leaks happened what who played part I have to apologize I keep referring to this person is he they actually prefer to be referred to as they so I'll probably accidentally say he but this person does preferred they/them pronouns so forgiven if I slip out of that just out of habit but this person known as Ganic s-- online posted the confession saying that how it happened was there was another individual security researcher by trade who online that has a number of aliases but the one used in this context their alias is whacko i don't want to use their real name but they hacked into both Nintendo and Microsoft servers and March 2017 and then were caught in May 25th two months later in May 2017 they were prosecuted ended up getting off pretty light didn't get jail time I hope this isn't improper to say but it's my understanding that a disrespect of course but it's my understanding that one of the reasons they were let off is because they're autistic and the judge limited their internet use and decided that they weren't you know a general threat to you know society so this person did not wacko did not get jail time fortunately but is Wakko United States or a different country cuz I guess that would be different I suppose depending on how they were or do we not know it's in the public record I want to say British okay can't say there's a hunt confidence because I may be forgiving I wanna say British though but regardless so the way it happened was this person wacko a hacked these servers and I guess had a particular interest in Pokemon you know the most famed kind of the most sought-after maybe legendary demo of all time in all video games is the space world 1997 demo of gold and silver which is you know rumors been going around for years the people drawing what they saw fan art saying a lot come on that looks like this it was in the release version and it gotten kind of legendary over the past 20 years or so so that was I guess kind of top priority for wakko so what Wanko did was there's a discord server that a lot of kind of you know like a prototype beta content enthusiasts use called a pret discord server and so Wakko created like an alternate count and on an anonymous account dropped off the the ROM for the spatial demo and with a limit of 20 downloads and then turned around and logged into his regular account along with jnx the person who made this confession has relayed this story to us they both downloaded got two of those 20 downloads but you know who dropped this off pretending that it wasn't them who done it and then they those 20 people became what's now known as team space world they pulled in a few other translators and people like that and they dissected the demo and that's how we you know came to know what was in the demo so this essentially janux and Wakko were lying about not knowing where it came from because I knew exactly where it came from and I was shortly after that I believe if I'm getting my timeline right that Wakko was caught and prosecuted is now under limited internet access and then Wakko gave a bunch of the other prototype beta assets to janux who distributed some of it to Helix chamber the Gen 1 stuff sure eventually leaked the Gen 4 stuff on 4chan and and yeah that's basically the story which is it all came from that Nintendo hack person was prosecuted and it's my understanding that there are still a lot more of the stuff that came from that hack that has not been made public and I would imagine some gen 3 stuff would be in there and who knows what else probably lots of non Pokemon stuff sure Microsoft actually was also hacked but I guess we'll just stick with Pokemon for this conversation so the still a lot more out there some of it I've heard rumblings about and some that I just I'm sure I have no idea about so high it's been an exciting time to be in the you know beta content Pokemon biz and so much has come out of that week that of that hack and I think there's still more to come probably in the next you know coming years specifically for like the gen 4 stuff is there still stuff coming or does everything that you have up here kind of all of it or was there as so much that we're like slowly filtering through as far as Gen 4 I pretty sure the only thing that has been made public or a few shiny sprites shinies of sprites that were already in the leaked janux actually gave those to me but I haven't published them because I was kind of afraid I'd be crossing the line and maybe I would be open to some legal prosecution yeah I was gonna ask that if you like feel like you're in this weird middle ground where somebody was already prosecuted about having this information and now you're publishing the information from I don't even know I like first and secondhand third-hand source right so you know when I'm reporting on what's been leaked at I'm pretty sure I'm legally just fine right but if I'm the first person to publish these hacked sprites then I I'm not a lawyer and I don't really have a lawyer so I'm but I feel like that would probably be crossing a line into being liable so I have not distributed those those hats shiny sprites from the Gen 4 League okay so like with the the jet for leak again is there is there anything else here that signifies like why this stuff was cut I mean we have there like the different Charizard it's the different side X you know the different Pikachu's again I guess going back to the aina and I forgive me because I'm not a hacker either but is like there's something like notes or something that we're also pulled that maybe like maybe we'll save this for later or maybe this just isn't ready I don't think there were any notes extracted from the hack someone again like I said 4chan does serve its purpose despite using some naughty words but someone on 4chan did point out and I included this and and one of my two articles covering that Gen four League there's an issue of coral Cora magazine from shortly before Gen fours release where they quote Game Freak saying that all Pokemon will have gender differences or at least most of them will have gender differences of course and the release version I think it was something like eighty of the you know four hundred some-odd Pokemon ended up with with gender differences and now this league shows this gives us a peek at what they were thinking when they were considering giving nearly every Pokemon the gender differences and speculated my article as far as why they would throw out that idea which is probably just that they realize it was a lot of extra work to make all these animated sprites with with you know of two of each one and I don't think it probably wouldn't have you know sold any extra copies no one was gonna say we all buy that new Pokemon game because of the gender differences I wouldn't think that would make a big difference in sales and then yeah I'm sure they're probably looking to the future when it was time to make 3d models and future generations and they're thinking oh do we really want to have you know a thousand Pokemon two versions of everyone making all this extra work for ourselves and not really making the extra money and at that point they decided to sharply you know curb their idea of giving so many Pokemon gender differences that's that's my theory it is cool to see like how I mean this just definitely seemed pretty ambitious and as somebody who like me primarily I like love collecting Pokemon I'm the I'm the dude that I was like well I need every I'll crap me form so that's 63 not including shiny so I guess this is what I'm doing right I'm one of the guys who collects them all not one of the one who you know max is added stats I'm right getting the full living pokedex yeah you're pretty confident in this reporting you're pretty confident of everything that you you know you reported on here how does that tie in then with some of the you know the other stuff like I guess going jumping a little bit back to the space world stuff with all those baby Pokemon that were cut like baby mouths or the evolution of far fetch is it kind of just the the same the same situation these things were just cut we don't really have a reason for it besides you know maybe it was too much work or maybe they didn't have the space or maybe they didn't have the time or is that a slightly different story it's kind of different in different cases so like for space world demo you know originally junichi Masuda the series director has said that they worked after they completed red and green they were working on blue yellow gold and silver all simultaneously and they were originally planning on gold and silver to launch in 1998 the space world demo was exhibited in November 97 so I think at that point they were thinking it wasn't far off things end up getting delayed and I could we go into this pretty deep I just try not to be too long-winded here but it makes they end up getting delayed and in that time because you know Ken Sugimori the lead master designer an art director he said that gen 2 they made several hundred Pokemon but they cut most of them or this you know didn't use most of them and just willed it down to a hundred so I think the spatial demo is something like a snapshot in time when they thought that they'd be releasing the game fairly soon these works were like the top 100 Pokemon that they'd come up with at that point and then the games end up getting delayed it took two years and so by that time they'd had another top hundred and they decided I would assume you know we don't need 17 baby Pokemon in this list of new 100 Pokemon so let's Whittle it down to seven yeah yeah I'm sure each Pokemon that was Cod had had various you know reasonings but um I think it mostly just comes down to those were the hundred best they had at the time and then two years later they had they're top hundred list you heard it here first qwilfish a hundred best oh you got me run the mill of it drink a coffee there there's a lot of debate about shiny colors and how they were just automatically generated back in the day and they weren't like hand-picked I think at one point somebody said they started hand picking Chinese and like Gen 5 maybe you know actually I'm that's a good good thing to bring it up cuz actually I had been misinformed about this for a long time because I dread you know all over the internet that they were determined by some kind of knife or an algorithm or just automatic palette swap or something to that effect and basically that they weren't manually chosen I dread that for a long time and you know supposedly it was until they moved the 3d models or sometime around that time period that they started hand picking them but I just recently actually was corrected by a former team space world member goes by the name rom hacking carrot that's his online alias he's he was in team space world and he is a Gentoo disassembler he makes rom hacks - Chen - that kind of thing so he is one of those people who's you know spinning around in his computer chair hacking into well into games not in the servers but and he told me this I later had it confirmed by someone else with the technical know-how that there is the you know internal data does show that they were hand-picked from the very start the only time that they were determined by some kind of a palette swap was in the space world demo but in the gen 2 release version gold and silver they were manually chosen and and they always have been although they did reuse some palettes which is maybe why sometimes you'll see oh well this blue pokemon and this blue pokemon both have pink shinies in those instances it's a matter of you know them sort of you know maybe we're lazily reusing those palettes yeah they actually did mainly the developers did choose every Pokemon shiny color from the very start but and also after they told me this I looked and compared some sprites from different generations even in Gen 2 you look at you know say like Meowth same for us and I think was right you were the three examples I posted on Twitter where they're all their main color is all yellow but they're all different colors and their shiny colors are all different which would seem to back up these ROM hackers claims that that that they're not predetermined palette swaps you know that yellow was always green there yeah we was always paying her what have you so one of the the newer articles you have sorry we're jumping around one of the newer articles you have talks about the Gen 5 starters right this pretty good read oh thanks yeah that was so in Japan they have a magazine called Nintendo dream which is kind of like the Japanese version of what we used to have in the u.s. called Nintendo power except they had you know more of a direct connection to to people like Game Freak a Nintendo was a Nintendo Power was more not as closely connected just because you know people weren't connect you know Japan and America wearing is connected by things like the internet and so forth in the 90s but anyway so Nintendo power back around the time of Gen 5s release did a series of interviews of the course of several magazines with Ken Sugimori and a couple other Pokemon designers who basically describe the design origins of most of the Gen 5 Pokemon about 100 110 of them or so out of the hundred fifty-six so there's some interesting information in there they described some scrap Pokemon they decide described some early designs of Pokemon that did make into the game for example he said earlier that you're really into pronouncing Pokemon names right I always mispronounce them wrong so you give me but but just cuz all this stuff I read on the internet or I'm playing the game I read the name and and you don't really watch the anime so right yes I'll say the names wrong 99% of times so forgive me no worries but but so he says dwell and the Ken Sugimori says that dwell on crustal were originally furnace Pokemon with shells made out of ceramic pottery a kiln fired pottery and presumably would have been fired the half fire type although he doesn't say that necessarily but as furnace Pokemon I would assume that it's likely that they would have been at least half fire yeah I also have kind of a pet theory that the reason that dwells shiny is red is kind of a callback to I would imagine he was probably originally read as a furnace Pokemon he doesn't say that Ken's Sookie more doesn't say that but I think that's probably a safe assumption that they were red fire pokemon but anyway so Ken Sugimori these other two developers to talk about basically the development of all the mostly Gen 5 Pokemon they say that Amber is based on zhang FEI from the chinese epic romance the three kingdoms zhang FEI is kind of like a drunken general who ends up getting assassinated by his own soldiers he also says that the three starter lines in Gen 5 were meant to represent Japan China and the West with superior being a European night and more of course being a Chinese general and actually not samer odd the Duat is meant to be a samurai they also go into how when they were making up the otter family that is the Oshawa line how is kind of coincidental they couldn't they didn't want to just make bigger and bigger otters so one of the designers went to the zoo to see otters to come up with some ideas and there just happened to be a live sea lion show next to the the otter exhibit and so he was like what if we had the otter evolved into a sea lion which I think for what I can tell from Twitter most people don't really like that idea but that's that's a tandem happening camera does not really loved that much unfortunately I when I've tweeted about this this how this visit to the zoo ended up leading to samraat I always get commenting something like how versus you had been closed that day or well it's funny because I don't know if enough you've ever seen Digimon or sus or whatnot but Gollum on which is an otter like Digimon evolves into Iike cumin which looks very much like samurai so and I kind of put those two together I'm not sure if that's like those designs are based off something reminiscent of you know a creature in Japan Japanese lore but I was like okay I can I can accept samurai a lot more seeing that it's kind of very similar to this like Digimon family but again there's like a gamer I don't think you could have heard talk about that or say that but I would like to point out that Game Freak is very this was sort of unusual like I said I got my hands on these old Japanese magazines and paid a translator to translate them into English I'll put them on my website but other than a few exceptions Game Freak is usually very secretive about what influenced what pokemons designed the design process this is kind of interesting a few months back you know James Turner yes love James Turner he was the art director on sword and shield he's been with Game Freak since gen5 he a few months ago I went through his entire Twitter history and you know search through every tweet he'd ever made looking for development information and and he said for example again I'm gonna pronounce this wrong but nagging adele is that right noggin needle noggin hit okay noggin because it's going to be uh naga and then needle but yet naga needle it's it's look the anime said it I'm just repeating it I said it wrong all I said around for the two years but yet Nagin Adel okay well via he said that Nagin Adel someone on Twitter to asked him about Nagin a told he'd said like oh you know I was going for really sleek alien design I was very influenced by HR Giger he said his exact words were I'm a big HR Giger fan HR Giger's most famous for being the guy who designed the alien for the xenomorph things and he also said that earlier in development Naga Nadel had legs that eventually got removed from his design and yeah it seemed pretty clear that he drew inspiration from from HR Giger and probably the xenomorph specifically from those Alien films of the course of the processes of designing Naga Nadel so I so I pulled about 50 or so quotes of that kind of development information from his Twitter and then I started sharing them you know one day I'd do a couple quotes about Nagin Adel another day I do this and that some stuff I pulled from his Twitter and then I later we someone asked me like podium a source for that quote we have pulled up for you and I realized that tweet had been deleted oh oh all the tweets I've quoted had been deleted and that I've looked on socialblade and I realized that the day after I had quoted cuz I died polo the quotes all together and yeah put them in a Word document but so fortunately I still have them but apparently the day after I had posted the first of those development quotes from James Turner's Twitter he'd gone through his old his whole Twitter feed himself right after I gone through all that and he went deleted all that kind of information interesting you know what's funny is I asked James Turner it was about people and Nagin Adel I asked him shortly after ultra Sun ultramoon came out with zero expectation of him responding I asked him because this was going back to the shiny thing we brought up earlier I was like hey did you do you know who like did you I know you made people and Nagin Adel that you've cited that but did you make their shinies and he said he replied to me pretty quickly and he said yeah I made their shinies and I wanted them to look like Hornets so that's why I decided on the the yellow and black no I'm like super curious if he deleted that tweet that's funny that was that was one of the quotes that I copy/paste it was yea his response to you apparently I like I think I still have the tweet I screenshot at it because I was like oh my gosh James turn to reply ever replied to me this is so cool you should probably hold on to that because I'm pretty certain it was one I pulled from about 50 and I saw that the day after I started quoting his tweets he deleted a hundred tweets so I checked about a half dozen all the half dozen that I'd used were deleted so I would assume he delete all the ones I took plus about another 50 that you know he also want to get rid of although I guess that I didn't think we're valuable enough to copy paste but yeah I think he probably deleted his response to your tweet at this point dang it I'm so very flattered that he tweeted at me he's like one of my favorite artists in Pokemon for sure like I love all his designs well hold on to it cuz you know I you know I've covered lost Pokemon history in this case that is definitely you could consider that lost Pokemon history at this point since it was deleted by James Turner so you know you played a role and getting a little bit of information out of him and then I I guess Game Freak later came and said like hey some dick that's worth some some jerk on Twitter's been quoting your do your stuff you should have said so go to your Twitter history in the lead all that development information so you got it out of him and then he later was told to delete it so good work I think the only thing that this solidifies is we probably can't get away with asking him any questions anymore probably not none of that sort that's a bummer but we can talk a little bit more about kind of like translations and staff while we're on the topic yeah so what's interesting is like you're paying somebody to translate this stuff for you is and I kind of always wondered this with you know like like Sarah B and with bubble pedia you know being these two big resources in the Pokemon world the I hate saying this because I know it's not true but does like the the question would be does the Japanese audience care about this do they not have their own pokemon sites where they're they're easily translating their own magazines that they're getting is like I feel like that has to exist somewhere right I would think so although you know I don't speak Japanese so I've I can't just surf around the web as easily as I'd like to although I you know I live in China I have for about ten years and there's I've gotten pretty good at searching for things in other languages that I don't fully understand so what I can tell it's not very well documented for example the way I originally found out about those Nintendo dream magazine issues that talk about the Gen 5 origins was there was a now-defunct but still on the wayback machine Japanese language blog where someone had transcribed those interviews for the magazine in Bulba pedia as they sometimes do they'll cite Japanese language stuff and then I guess someone said oh it says this in English so it's untranslated they use it as a source and in this case I went and had that source translated but actually had more recently finasteride actually bought the magazines I realized that a lot of what this person had transcribed was actually summaries not actual quotes so maybe he'd summarized a paragraph into a couple sentences so I ended up having to get a lot of that stuff retranslated but as far as I can tell even in Japanese a lot of it's not too well documented which yeah it makes it necessary to actually go find the actual magazines or you know other primary source documents and actually get a professional to translate them and unfortunately doesn't seem like there's a super good source of like a Japanese person who's actually collected that in one place so um you know a lot of work to be done sure there's tons of hardcore Japanese Pokemon fans at every magazine sitting in a closet yeah you have to find those people right so like just this past week there was a similar thing why I was bumping around on Bulba PD and I found like a or they they cited a source but there was no you know I wouldn't hold up in a college-level essay it was just said like well this this says this in this book but there's no page number there's no translation there's no direct quote it just said like this is mentioned in this book it was the the book was an autobiography of and I gonna try and say her name but she's the host of Pokemon Sunday and she's a voice actress who does spiky you're Pikachu Shoko something anyway in autobiography it says as some I'm gonna tweet about tomorrow it says that spiky eared Pikachu was originally supposed to be white Pikachu and that they were they were planning on releasing like white Pichu branded white cream soup because fry so the Japanese the words for for spikey gear there for white peach you and white cream soup are almost identical there's like one letter difference and so like oh if we're gonna make white Pikachu we can just start selling white soup but white Pichu on it but they ended up it's kind of complicated they ended up scrapping that idea and going for spikey your Pichu and that was based off of this the girl who does the one of the voice actors is always making typos and basically one of the typos that she was always making the word is originally he's big but she made a type of typo which translates to like spiky or spiky eared something to that effect and so they said oh she's always making this type but let's use that typo spiky spiky ear peak okay let's do spiky or Pichu yeah let's do that there's actually concept art I've got photos of her the the girl the type of girl with official concept art of ye Picchu and I've when I got that book on Japanese Amazon with the help of a guy named Webster shout out to him and had it translated by another friend of mine no gasps whose backpack I'm not sure if you're familiar with him I've heard of that item but he had been helped me on some translation stuff recently finding but he's books that kind of thing he's great but um anyway so I actually had to get the Japanese book have it translated someone else had a picture of that concept art that they'd sent me and kind of was able to put this whole story together about how originally they had white Picchu playing for Gen 4 and not to mention the the cream soup merchandising but they ended up throwing that idea in the trash this is a this is a dumb question but regards to this translation so even even in you know 2019 when Masuda and some other members of game freak's sat on stage at e3 and you know they they said what they needed to say about you know not all Pokemon coming into a sword and shield you had all these people on the internet saying like oh they must have missed translated it wrong or maybe we just didn't understand and then you know fast forward a couple months with the Game Informer interview where the Game Informer said there was you know I think what 18 gems and then they're like no that was a mistranslation cancel the only eight Tim's only eight gems only eight gems do you do you worry that in your end with the you know people you pay for translation that you know something might not be actually a hundred percent maybe they got one or two words wrong or misinterpreted something I've gone through a few translators there's a few people I'd use that they I'd have had to throw out their translations because it just wasn't up to snuff the people I've been using more recently I'm feel pretty confident about and I always double-check key phrases the most important parts really with other translators to make sure that you know if Ken Sugimori said that you know at the Hydra gun family were originally supposed to be tanks and that the purple tread marks on their bellies and their final designs are leftovers from the tanks you know that's pretty important information to make sure it's it's right and so when I get that in from the translator I'll make sure and double-check that because that's particularly important and you know if necessary all you know make any adjustments to the translation and check that back with the original translators there's a lot of back-and-forth that goes on with these translations but fortunately the the translator I'll be using more recently is really good and also a Pokemon fan herself so that helps a lot because I've learned that in the past with you if you have a good translator if they don't know what pokemon is then then there's gonna be some some you know errors just cuz they don't know what a trainer is I don't know what a Pikachu is I don't know what leveling up is and you know so forth so that makes sense can we bring up something that was a little bit controversial here and bubble pedia has since corrected forgive me I'm so bad at saying Japanese names you're you know exactly we're going to go with this mmm say out oh I would mispronounce it monster I would say moon ao Saito okay but it's probably wrong to who's the male versus female thing yeah so not only was it a male versus female thing but I don't know what happened you know somewhere in the last 20-some years where people think that a saber-tooth Tiger is a dog and so the other two are also a dog Ken Sugimori I think on Twitter who then asked the creator of n tastes weakened and raikou you know what their thought process was and they they tweeted about it and I saw this over a year ago I think it was a reddit thread that you know somebody took all the big screen shot at all the conversation put it in a giant image and you recently just tweeted about it and for whatever reason Bulma pedia said she instead of he it was kind of like a lot to unwrap here one that Bobo pedia said she for several years and to that you know even after you tell fans that you know they said for the most part that you know they're based off a lion and a tiger and stuff that people still are like well I'm calling them dogs right very weird it was pretty weird yeah yeah someone had sent me that reddit reddit thread that was like a copy-paste and translation of a Twitter conversation they're making like five social medias all mixed up yeah I've seen that conversation between Sugimori and Saito I'd originally was talking to I referred to side 2 as a girl and some people said now it's a he then I started saying oh Thomas oh no he like mousey but hey at this point I've got my week last week when I like when your tweet last week with the week before I was like well they have always known it as a girl and they're saying he is it then I started saying he and then people are like not to she cuz it's on both PD and I was like I feel like I feel like lava probably did more research than I do Wow so as other people told me cuz you know there's there's several gamefreak developers who are really hard to find pictures or even any information about them there's several that just don't have it's dumb there's none on Google Images they're not anywhere someone did end up the Japanese person did end up sending me pictures of manao site oh and it is definitely dude and there's some other stuff like in some game free documents they list all their the staff who worked on this particular project they listed them all as male or female and Saito's listed as a male so it's definitely dude say that with confidence now but because it says I'm bald VPD is she anytime they have up station or she oh they have okay as a February 12th it says he has worked for Game Freak so I'm not sure when that happened but I guess I guess somebody somebody probably saw that conversation for me recently because when you tweeted that which again was like maybe a week or two ago of this conversation it still said she I think it was probably there's a bull the PD moderator who's an absolute rockstar is he's he's he knows a lot of time I'll have a question I'll go him he just has all these weird Japanese books and maps and all kinds of stuff that I didn't even know existed and I'll have a question he'll have like a pile of documents will go through just to confirm whether this map should be considered canon or not but anyway there's Snorlax Monster is a bubble pedia moderator that I'm yes ends with and we've had him on the show before he's great oh oh yeah he's great and he's probably the one who updated that he's yeah he's really good but you're you're gonna keep on I guess reporting on old Pokemon stuff for the time being I see I don't I don't think you're gonna I mean it doesn't sound like you're you're not doesn't sound like you're gonna stop looking for magazines in the in the future here no I'm all about that old news so for our listeners where can they find yourself I know you have YouTube you have your website you have your Twitter if there's any one that you want to maybe shout out that you missed and are almost 90 minute conversation YouTube and Twitter I'm dr. lavas lost Pokemon and my website is lava cut content and yeah cover the kind of stuff that we've been talking about Japanese content translations cut content beta material that kind of thing awesome well I appreciate you have having you on if you know in a month or so you have more news and you still can't leave your house we can definitely have you back on for sure that sounds great cuz I they're saying it's gonna be two or three months until it's safe to go outside so actually unreal I love to come back on all all the links for a lava cut content will be in the show notes we are going to take a quick break and we come back we'll do our pokemon of the week and our question of the week so we will be back in a second [Music] I have a very important announcement be prepared for a very important announcement yeah yes musical accompaniment at first happens sometimes it's a major international stage it goes [Music] do do do do do do do you recognize it that's all it is the intro to my new podcast kata Mari gasps : let's roll up together walk across this show this show we are back Pokemon home sensation of the week some issues that we talked about last week there were some good things we talked about last week they have updated the app three times since we last talked if you are on iOS they updated it four times if you're on Android because the last update 1.0.8 is specifically only for Android I believe it had to do with like 32-bit devices I think so iOS never got 1.0.8 I'm assuming they updated again both versions will go to one point zero point nine has your opinions on home changed at all since the updates and since it's now been more than a week since the service has come out I mean my opinion the updates have not had any influence on my opinion um I did upload so I'm being very cautious because I just want to control my Pokemon experience pretty strongly and what I don't want to happen because I just recall with Pokemon bank with ultra Sun and ultra moon was you could synchronize your Pokemon bank with those games and then it would say oh you've already completed the national dex because you have it all up in bank and like I don't want that to accidentally happen with Pokemon sword because right now I am going through and building a living Dex in Pokemon sword because that's actually fun for me to do and I'm having a lot of fun doing that so I uploaded my current living Dex which is up through Mel metal into Pokemon home it actually I mean it's gone okay the boxes there's like on the mobile phone it's odd but it's not the end of the world just like they they have the for some reason they have like a list of bank or not they have like home boxes and now I just had it open in front of me and I Chloe you're talking about the labels is they label your home boxes or your label they label the boxes that come from banks so you can find them easier when you deposit them yeah so I have like bank 1 through 27 although there I mean yeah bank 1 through 27 but they're in descending order for for whatever reason and then I have like home 1 through infinity and on a twitch for some reason like even though I uploaded the Pokemon into Pokemon home in a very orderly fashion they're not in any order in the home so home defaults because it's like go it defaults to like the default view is the last 30 that you deposited yeah whatever reason guess that makes sense because if you just deposited you probably want to know where they want maybe well so now like my box like if I'm on my phone which I am and I go into box home one right okay so that's that's organized right okay so it's Bulbasaur Ivysaur Venus or Charmander Charmeleon Charizard that's it's all good but I know but where's Mel tan and Mel metal well they do have I mean Mel Mel tan is 808 Mel metal is eight or nine but they're not they're not there uh it's they're not in order anymore even though when I look at the other ones they are in order I just so I didn't realize this from last week Greg I don't know if this answers your question but okay so I have a minor complaint here I'm sure they can fix this but it really bothers me that I can't reorder my labels mm-hmm because I have like so I have live labels for like 2012 event 2013 event 2018 event dozen 15 event they're in the wrong order and then I have different labels for like so a lot of those events are mythical but I also have a label for all my mythical x' which apparently have 74 of that I can just find so I can look at all my mythical x' at once by clicking the mythical label or if I want to look at like these are the Pokemon I specifically got during 2016 events I can click on that but then under all the labels it does show the boxes so my first box is 0 0 1 2 0 3 0 and then 0 3 1 2 0 60 so it does show you all the boxes that you have and then eventually gets to like home 10 home 11 home 12 because I haven't renamed those boxes so does that not solve the issue you're looking for because I can click on 0 0 1 2 0 3 0 and now I can see that box of those 30 Pokemon yeah they're in pokedex gravity so let me say something really nice about look at my house like one thing that they did that no Pokemon game as far as I know has done before and it's something that I've wanted for a very long time if the Pokemon is shiny when I'm looking at it in the box for you I see the shiny oh yeah tellers yes that is very nice which well when you said how my game has ever done Pokemon go says hi okay I I mean who's gonna say I came oh c'mon I care about but let's not be so harsh to answer your question like it has my experience gotten better was that your question I guess that was the original question yeah no okay I mean I do like the graphics for the Pokemon to like the the drawings that they've made yeah the art yeah the problems that exist before still exist there's still some questions about like like why is my date countered when the challenges not counting up like there's still a bunch of bikes which is fine everything has bugs are we ready for my PSA cuz this is my pee yes I would love to hear your PSA all right dear users of the Internet if a person on the GTS has put up a video and is asking for a video back they are not looking for the exact same form that they're sending nobody is gaining anything that I'm sending you a Japanese form butterfly and you send me back the same Japanese form butter would it is right that when I send it yeah you can look at it I'm like who are you people they're like oh I'll trade you the exact same vivillon foot who's winning in that trade no one that's that white that's up there oh man also just Pokemon company I know you're listening please please put something in that if somebody checks Venusaur from level 1 to 10 that that can't exist tell it to say no boiler it can technically because of Pokemon go you can have like a level 5 Charizard but we can't access it yet right clan let's go Pikachu let's go Eevee so if somebody caught a wild level 5 Charizard they can move it through let's go Pikachu let's go Eevee into Pokemon home I didn't think about that until somebody brought it up yeah but like Gen 5 isn't in there oh yes sir like you can't be like a problem if if suddenly something becomes available and they say hey we're gonna click check this out and check it off great khali people are asking for level 1 to 10 b vm they don't exist they can't exist it doesn't have off to level 12 yes and for your own server space and for people trying to search anything just say those things aren't possible because you had put up a Ditto right i put up a did a level 40 56 did oh that i caught in cerulean cave and let's go p - lets go i put up a Ditto and i asked for a vivre Leone and I have one I got a bunch of Japanese ones because people are trading me the exact same ones over and over and over again do you think I could find your ditto amongst all the people asking for things that are not possible no one could buy my dunno I searched by every option and because it fills up so fast with a lot of stuff that can't happen like I I went through this is how I went to try to frame you I did level range game it came from and I couldn't find it because you can select those as filtering options and it wasn't there but everybody else asking for things that didn't exist sure were it's just a very frustrating that well I think the more frustrating thing that we talked about last week was that it was hey I'm looking for a zero aura but I'm only offering a Weedle right and they fixed that that was actually one of the the first things that they fixed after the podcast obviously because they listened to the podcast obviously but you can't trade mythical Pokemon anymore and you could never trade mythical Pokemon which we talked about last week the reason that mythical Pokemon you can always trade a mythical Pokemon to somebody in the same room as you locally through a link cable or through a IR or through Wi-Fi or whatever when Greg was here like a year ago I traded him a meloetta that I got from the World Championship and you traded me I think Victini or something I was missing yeah something I was missing but we traded mythical Pokemon that works on the GTS mythical Pokemon have ribbons that prevent them from being traded ideally the cherish ball also you're not supposed to be able to trade cherish ball Pokemon through the GTS but it's the ribbon itself that prevents the trade it's usually like celebratory ribbon or ribbed like ribbon of event the in X&Y and Sun and Moon the GTS were was had a bunch of mythical Pokemon that you could trade but they were all hacked or pique hexed because they were missing the ribbon so when you when those people created the Pokemon from scratch in their third party program they just didn't include the ribbon which allowed it to be traded so it's like one way to tell if your Pokemon was authentic is is that the correct OT is the correct ID numbers does it even have the ribbon if you can just say no to all of those because if you got it wonder traded to you it wouldn't it had to not have the ribbon to arrive to you so they pretty much turned off all mythical stuff yeah in the NBA it can't be traded but you can still request that to be sent to you yeah but let those let those people waste their threw you across but it but it Gunks up the search right sure does it it just Gunks up the works well it ruins the user experience is what it is yeah and so it's just like if if mythical can't be accepted through traded through the GTS or Wonder donut or Wonder I don't have that's a selectable option just get rid of it just get rid of it legendaries are so broken for some reason if you toggle don't search by legendaries type null and the tapas are still showing even if you have that on and off so that's still broken as of this podcast yep mythical z' can no longer be room traded wait that was part of the other thing so again i don't they they're there needs to be like what pokemon go did wear knee antic was like okay you can trade one legendary a day you gotta be local you're not allowed to trade mythical x' you can trade like there needs to be some almost like a checklist of like what is allowed and what is not allowed because now we have multiple ways between pokemon go sword and shield sun and moon wonder trade room trade surprise trade GTS what can be traded where we need a list if they came out and they were like hey this is what we're doing mythical x' can only be traded when you're standing next to a person i'm sure like that would be probably upsetting to a lot of people but at least we know and if they were like hey legendaries can be traded with friends whether that is through the GTS or through wonder trade or through whatever cool but you're only allowed one a day and if you have 800 trubbish trade to your heart's content on everything in the world but we but like that's the frustrating part right now for people is they want to get the maguey erna of different color so like I'm sure they will I'm sure they will release more mythical Pokemon as we go well if I was missing Victini I don't have a way to put bikini into sword and shield to trade a friend yep so the only way I can trade Victini is by standing next to a friend and I can trade them a Victini they can then register it in their national decks they can then apply to get this the Miggy R now which hopefully it was still not fully fixed but they get the Miggy Renault for having complete decks then they trade me the Victini back and we're good and I I personally don't have a problem with that because like at the end of the day that's what Pokemon go kind or Pokemon was always is like gotta talk to you got to make friends and trade oh and he does that anymore yeah but if they really want to keep my mythical Pokemon special Greg I saw you trade 20 Pokemon with somebody just this Thursday night and that somebody was a friend of yours so don't say yeah he does that anymore I made that friend before making that trade I didn't make that friend while making those yeah okay look if I met some random person and they were like hey can I borrow your Victini I'd be like maybe not but if it was a genuine friend and that they were missing like three mythical Pokemon and we met each other at PAX like finally hey we've known each other for two years I know you're only missing Sara aura and Victini let me trade these V's real quick cool you got Mihrimah gearing I think's for those back I'm so happy I was able to help you like that's it that is a situation I want to happen and it can happen but there's still there's this vagueness of like Game Freak what would you like us players to do like give like list out what you what your overview of this service should be because now people are like what how are we supposed to trade these things do you if you want us to trade them in person and you want these to be special just save that just come out and say like hey this is our this is our goal going forward here are the expectations we are setting and if you put an exclamation point saying I've completed a challenge but when I go in the challenges you haven't put an exclamation point on the one that I've completed I still don't know what I just did I think that has I think the challenges and the news that is the thing that's broken because I've noticed people who can't get my gear nah even if they have a complete national dex they also their challenges say they've only checked the app on day one so those to me those two problems seem to be together the challenges and the maguey erna seem to be the the current most broken thing yeah like I don't I've literally used Pokemon home everyday because I've been trying to get my video index forms which again guess what kids it just got the same form for a same form it's maddening to me but like it doesn't move forward and I have I've had a people who are like oh I'll just borrow your zero or I'll give it right back and I'm like I don't want to give it to you and did not work have to have it not work or you have to hold onto it for a month until this gets fixed I'm not gonna give anything that I only have one copy of until I know this is fixed until this is actually going to reward you with the thing that you want and I don't like and it could be my gate like I'm stuck a lot of mine things are stuck on day one like but a lot of them aren't like I just did another twenty one two trades and that when to trade count went up but my days have it it's so like I get that there's bugs and there's always gonna be bug problems but I would just like to know or functionality the function I would just like to know before like is it a bug on my end should I be submitting a bug report is this a well known issue is this you know it's not been a long time which is fine but like I can't give a hundred percent thumbs up on it when I'm still feeling really uneasy with a lot of the core function yeah and I use it a lot like people are like upset or whatever that I meant not having an ideal time with home it hasn't stopped me from using it it didn't stop me from paying for it so they've got my money I just wished that I had more faith in it like sitting in your stream and doing a twenty room trade was fun yeah I really like room trade I think it's cool but until something fun and they're like I got more hacked oh I got more shiny house where that is and it's like okay dude no you don't yeah well you know control over it and it's fun it's fun because I know somebody who's doing that for entertainment is enough like if I was sitting at GenCon I'm not jumping in a bunch of randos room trait screen to be like let's zip it zip let's send whatever like it's a weird function that's fun in a very specific use case like and I sat out there and gave out a bunch of my hidden ability Rosalia's and then you know when I got they'll Litton from you I backed out and then when you do it again I run in and give away a few more like it's fun to send those things out but it's like not a thrilling function it is definitely well because the timer's on the room trade are so high it's like definitely so long well we got about six minutes before this Pokemon even starts to be traded so what would you count on it is there no way to say hey it's full skip to the neck now so there's two countdowns the first countdown is like it's what like 200 seconds or whatever it is the rear pointing out of the room and then that doesn't you don't that timer doesn't start until the host picks their Pokemon and once the host picks their Pokemon the room closes and then everyone else has then a new timer starts of 200 seconds which is everyone else picking their Pokemon but once everyone picks their Pokemon the timer still goes which I can kind of see is understandable because like if you were the last person to pick and then you selected the wrong Pokemon you don't want to be locked into that but there almost needs to be like once everyone picks now we've dropped the timer to 10 seconds and that gives any people an option to be like oh let me Reese elect which then extends the length because there was lots of times where everyone picked and we were still waiting in like 85 seconds I mean like 3 minutes is a long time yeah where do you like the raid battles where it's like once everybody says I'm good then it goes Oh in life sword and shield yeah yeah yeah like the timers are just really long I I was thinking because what are the rate timers in Pokemon go they're only like well it depends I think five stars have longer timers than like 1 2 stars I think and even then I'm like okay come on nobody mores coming let's go it's full there's twenty if you're listening and you're having some errors this is off support pokemon.com so if you're having error eight eight zero seven this occurs with an issue of Pokemon home save data on your device um so you have to delete the save data restart Pokemon home to resolve the issue deleting Pokemon home does not remove the Pokemon from your Pokemon home because that's on the cloud what you have to do is from the home menu select system settings scroll down to data management press a scroll down and highlight save delete save data press a if you're on the switch and you need to enter a parental controls you do that now select which game title you want to delete the save data for Pokemon home delete it it's like the user you want to delete a fourth the user that's having the issue and then delete it once you do that then redownload Pokemon home and it should fix that so that's support errors eight eight zero seven if you're on obviously the switch if you're getting error nine nine nine and these it means you just would be getting the error code right it's not like you're not seeing something happening if you're getting net specific you're getting that specific error so those are the ones that they've they've updated these like ten hours ago so these are still known errors that's why I'm bringing them up this air so the if you're getting error nine nine nine this error is caused that you have one or more Pokemon you're in creation using manipulated game data even if you've obtained this Pokemon unintentionally Pokemon created manipulated game data cannot be used in Pokemon home ok because you really so frustrating like knowing that people got hacked things the first day of wonder boxing like well I don't know they're never going to disclose what they look for at hacked Pokemon right but so many hacked Pokemon got through so if you're getting error $9.99 you probably have an obviously hacked Pokemon again I don't know if it's happened for if you have that issue so if that Pokemon has been moved to home they've somehow it made it through the Pokemon will cause the application to freeze or become unresponsive when you search for it if this happens you need to shut down and restart Pokemon home to resolve this program to resolve this problem delete any Pokemon of this kind from home by the following steps on the switch highlight the Pokemon press X press the a button to hold it up highlight release press a just this pokemon release and press a you're getting a 999 it's because of a hacked Pokemon eight eight eight is an issue with save data management those are the two most common issues according to support top Pokemon calm there was an issue that was fixed in 1.0.7 which was the face ID issue on iOS which when we talked about last week Pokemon Home has flaws and it wasn't great out the gate I had 800 people watching me on twitch when Pokemon home came out which is a very I mean in the grand scheme of things 800 people out of probably a million plus people that downloaded this game or application is very small but I not exaggerating with the amount of people that came into stream they couldn't find the app and when they didn't get the app that was greedy they couldn't log into the app and I'm and in retrospect I'm thinking like if you don't use Twitter right you don't use twitch and you know you just play pokemon and this was your first experience of like how am i I can't log into this app I can't link my Nintendo account like there was no support articles at the time you know no like even Sarah B wasn't reporting on how to fix this issue but I figured it out with my community which is if you were trying to log in via face ID it would fail and the only way to get past it was to manually type your password you couldn't copy and paste it you couldn't face ID it you just had to type it in yourself and it will work and they fixed it it's fixed now and it took him a week to fix it but if you didn't try that if you're just using face ID on iOS because it's worked for everything else and it doesn't work for this and you reset your password you did everything else none of that would have worked unless you typed your password which like I get it that's probably like hey no one tested face ID before it shipped because they probably all just typed in there like password 1 2 3 their test dummy accounts to make sure it worked but like I helped probably 50 60 plus people that night of just like hey I have iOS and I are like I can't login and my question was do you have iOS and Android and they would say iOS and I would say don't use face ID or touch ID and they would say oh my gosh that worked look the Pokemon company ain't paying me to do tech support but I was able to I was it I was able to help 50 plus people that night just by saying manually type in your password I don't know what the where the where I was going with that but those issues in general can definitely turn somebody off to be like well it just doesn't work I guess I'm not using it right and it doesn't help that the English App Store says nothing but bug fix every time they've updated the app where I go it is so frustrating I go to minimum do that Japanese support page and I hit Google Translate it does actually say what these issues fixed so that's how I know 1.0.7 fixed face ID cuz it literally says that in the official Japanese support page it tells you everything they fix but the English page it just says fixed bugs like I don't know what the I mean there may be a Japanese legal requirement that if you do update an application you have to specify exactly what your updates are doing can we yes we like have you met our government yeah but the personal person who updated resolve error 999 17 hours ago on support da Pokemon comm like why can't they just I don't know it just it's very frustrating that like we're not seeing the issues being fixed well that's part of the American legal system has never admit that you did anything wrong and it fern just say you fix blood yes because nobody can sue you for an ambiguous we fix the bugs they can sue you for face ID wasn't working and therefore I lost productivity of my job because specifically pace ID wasn't working that's just how America works well that's all you can I do my Pokemon home PSA right now it'd be real fast let me hear it no take your time PSA it up my Pokemon home PSA comes in two parts part the first if I am doing a max raid battle in Pokemon sword and or shield and you show up for my max raid with your shiny kill do where there has never been a shiny kill do possible you're gonna get banned number one part the second if you show up for my max raid battle in Pokemon sort sword and/or shield and it's a toxicity and you bring in your shiny vileplume because you wanna flex that you have a shiny vileplume you gonna get banned all right that's my PSA right there gotta get banned it is amazing it's why I mean it has calmed down but literally like on the first two or three days after Pokemon home everybody was bringing their shinies into Max raids like no matter how useless they were against the Pokemon we were max rating against and I was just like I got so incredibly frustrated and then I also discovered that like if I was playing during prime Japanese hours so like early early morning in the United States the max raids were normal and people brought normal Pokemon that would be super effective against the the Pokemon we were trying to get if I was playing in the evening everybody was doing their shiny flexes and you know all the the US times it was all shiny flexes who's ridiculous it's at yeah it's like I don't know it's probably the same person that would also like they need to let you know how long their hunt was and how many unfortunately they got 18 different shinies before they got this one so they need to let you know the stress and turmoil they went through before their sign name is Steve they documented as a video and put it up well that's like but what's funny for me is I do my little shiny hunts on snapchat every day and like invariably like every three or four months somebody says how many eggs have you hatched but I don't know I'm not writing down one time where I like kata-kata what what legendary was it I remember it was in Pokemon go but I walked all the way out to the end of this park there was a bunch of us it might have been armored me too or something so we all did the raid I caught them you too and then I like as soon as I caught it I like caught like a Jigglypuff or something that was was like around the gym this one dude look at me and he was like what Ivy's did you get I was like what he was like you're mute to your Mewtwo what Ivies did you get I was like I don't know man I didn't I didn't check and he like threw up his like frustrated that I didn't know where everybody asked he's like but prefer for Rhyhorn ride on day whatever yesterday and people were like did you get any four stars like I don't know never baited to that at all like geez that's just look I got I had 3000 plus Pokemon in my Pokemon home I'm not saying that the flex I'm saying that I like to catch pokemon and they exist and they're doing something there's they're generating those homeboy at some points I mean at the end of the day I don't care I was like I really need them for competitive purposes a bottle cap them or something I don't know what you want from me all right enough Pokemon home it's gotten seven updates in less than two weeks Pokemon bank had only got four updates and seven years so so I get winning on the bugs I guess that's better I guess yeah I guess that's a good sign for the future baby I suppose that the Apple only get better if they've updated it this many times this quickly so fingers crossed that that that in like two weeks they just stopped caring and never push out any updates Greg give us our question of the week Oh friends from slack you know how to keep our interest piqued with your questions of the week let's hear the question of the week yeah I was like let's hear the question we start from jet see if you were getting married who would be in your wedding party could be Pokemon or characters from the anime slash games for totals that includes the best man slash best woman it has to be from the series is this what we're saying well no people on our characters from anime slash games okay I first off this is like one of those like Zen impossible to answer questions because Steve's already married Greg's already married I'm unmarriable so okay if suddenly characters from Pokemon and Pokemon were coming back to life or became reality I would renew them vows yeah you can always renew your vows you can married again you get married same person twice right I mean I can't get married for the first time so well maybe if there was a wicked tongue standing next to you yeah no not my bag only if it knows body-slammed ah oh is that what it is v-max moves yeah yeah [Laughter] Wallace is in my party okay sure wand is in my party for sure couey's in my party for sure Cynthia that like Cynthia woods RSVP but never show yeah yeah you got that right dance well diantha would be in my party I would have to Anthon my party I mean she's a washed-up what was she a movie star where she is hardly washed-up I don't know about that I mean Rose arrayed would be my best person um I think it would go produce flowers like none other yeah likes hello and then it probably go Wallace Kakui diantha that's a good party enough and then I would fight every else I I would I would be guilted into sending alder an invite I guaranteed and then mmm because you know altars gonna drink know it here yeah you know I would have to say I'd probably have to bring I can't invite Sycamore he's he's too good-looking of a guy he'd be too distracting but you would probably want to invite the bride's get a runoff with Sycamore yeah yeah that's this Robinson's issue that's the worry i I you probably invite Professor Oak cuz you'd have some good stories to tell for those that don't want to be on the dance floor he is going to complain about the food and be in bed by 8:00 I'm sure he might he might leave the party really early who's gonna go pick up professor oak and who he has to drive professor oak oh okay I'm not that old I feel like I have to have Pikachu in the wedding party just because it's Pikachu sellout I have to have brachot I have to have Brock at the wedding the thing is if you invite Brock at the wedding you have to assign somebody to keep an eye on Brock because he is that guy at the wedding that is hoping to make the connection at your wedding and is making everybody uncomfortable yeah or Brock's gonna be the one who's like during your reception proposes to have you guys ever been to a wedding where somebody pulled that the leg oh heck no oh yes you have was it as awful as it seems um the answer is yes is it as awful as it seems no cuz you are imagining it to be much more cringe-worthy than it actually is because the reason what keeps it less cringe-worthy is because a half of the people at the wedding are on board for that to happen and they Buffett everybody else going how could you even think this was appropriate and so you have like you have like the shock of people of the people who are like what are you doing who are staring at this oncoming train and then the Oh starts from the idiot Brigade think that this is appropriate and charming and then you're all swept up in this and you're looking at the bride who has hit the roof and the bride mate is just handing drink after drink to calm the situation down and then it passes and then you all laugh about it and then everybody gets really drunk and helps to forget it so it's not as bad but it's pretty bad but I have been there yes a number on an unfortunate amount of occasion fortunate amount holy cow yeah man if that happens at my wedding it happened in my own family my own cousin did it to my other cousin oh my gosh Oh horror back to the question of the week this is a really hard question for me to answer because if some weird planets aligned to stars shifted in the sky for me to actually end up getting married you guys would probably find out about it like two months after it actually happened because I just like get it done at the city hall and like not even mention it you what - you're so rude okay here that's not rude that's like I said you guys the expense in the travel and all that way in the same city good luck I got married without bothering you guys yeah but you got a job you know what to take time yeah you don't want to take off on a Friday look I had to drive to Milwaukee for New Year's hey I'm sorry the best New Year's you've ever had hmm there was a year that I was fighting off Chad's in my basement because Dwight UK was happening so yeah [Laughter] Giovani would be my best man last week's Pokemon it evolves from a trade evolution has to use a tooth related item to evolve during that trade evolution and it has an erratic level in the rate even though that's really inconsequential and was kind of thrown in just to throw people off who's that pokémon evolves from Clamperl come on ocular II that does not evolve from killing pearl why are you the worst of course not that this is a great answer because this is the worst it's huntail it is huntail this the huntail is not the worst yeah that's pretty bad I mean it's not wearing a bra like Gore biz's look so now I regret bringing this up at all it wants to go where the people are don't mock it for its desires he creativity here with huntail I mean it's an eel that evolves from a clam yeah you evolve from a clam I don't know what that means muscle muscles like kappa clam there's little to no trivia about huntail besides know and despise bearing a pure water type Pokemon it bears dark type pokey assisted in Ranger shadows of Almia El Alamo game oh man I cannot wait for them to make pokemon ranger for the switch do you think they will not look they made pokemon mystery dungeon DX come on look at my Rangers guy pinions on this shy shuffle icon for huntail cuz it's ugly but so is huntail
