what's up everyone welcome to the 234 (0:20 - 0:27)
episode of the Pokemon podcast it's (0:24 - 0:31)
super effective I'm your host SBJ and we (0:27 - 0:34)
have monster hunter extraordinaire with (0:31 - 0:36)
us will while you were interrupting me (0:34 - 0:38)
while I was trying to gather aptos (0:36 - 0:40)
slivers I hope they're still there for (0:38 - 0:43)
me when I go back they'll be there (0:40 - 0:47)
they'll be there we also have pokemon go (0:43 - 0:51)
addict Travis the yesterday someone (0:47 - 0:54)
tweeted at the three of us saying just (0:51 - 0:56)
two more days than with i canna moat and (0:54 - 0:59)
excited emoji and I know for a fact will (0:56 - 1:01)
because you replied to this person but (0:59 - 1:04)
at least me and will were flabbergasted (1:01 - 1:06)
trying to figure out is there some big (1:04 - 1:08)
trailer that's coming out in two days or (1:06 - 1:11)
are they did I miss something in Pokemon (1:08 - 1:13)
Sun and Moon actually come out in two (1:11 - 1:16)
days whatever the do days and then they (1:13 - 1:19)
say oh the new episode of the podcast I (1:16 - 1:21)
I just couldn't believe that somebody (1:19 - 1:24)
would be so excited that I would have (1:21 - 1:26)
anticipated them up for disappointment (1:24 - 1:30)
now I also far removed from that kind of (1:26 - 1:31)
excitement for the show because I (1:30 - 1:34)
haven't met a consumer of it for uh for (1:31 - 1:39)
years high school yeah more than four (1:34 - 1:42)
years I feel like I get excited for the (1:39 - 1:44)
podcast I listened to every week oh I (1:42 - 1:46)
mean yeah that that's definitely the (1:44 - 1:48)
case but and I get excited to record to (1:46 - 1:52)
the show but cognitively i'm not i'm no (1:48 - 1:55)
longer at a place where i ate associate (1:52 - 1:57)
this thing that we do every Sunday with (1:55 - 1:59)
a thing that people listen to which is (1:57 - 2:02)
probably why I'm so brash about the (1:59 - 2:05)
terrible jokes I think that's fair for (2:02 - 2:08)
our listeners well if you're new (2:05 - 2:10)
listener welcome if you are returning (2:08 - 2:12)
listener or if you're new listener and (2:10 - 2:14)
this applies to both this is our show (2:12 - 2:16)
for you guys we have a little bit of (2:14 - 2:17)
pokemon news we're gonna be talking (2:16 - 2:18)
about the ubs we're going to be talking (2:17 - 2:21)
about the pokemon generation stuff and (2:18 - 2:24)
one or two other things and then (2:21 - 2:26)
actually the generations will probably (2:24 - 2:28)
be the main topic because i feel like we (2:26 - 2:30)
have a lot to say about it even though (2:28 - 2:32)
that's it's probably like eight minutes (2:30 - 2:33)
of footage and (2:32 - 2:35)
then we have our pokemon a week and if (2:33 - 2:37)
we have time maybe we'll squeeze in some (2:35 - 2:38)
emails but our show's been running like (2:37 - 2:40)
two hours long so and which is fine (2:38 - 2:43)
there's no complaints there at all it's (2:40 - 2:45)
just if they run long then it takes me (2:43 - 2:48)
longer to edit and that's that's fine (2:45 - 2:52)
it's all fine everything is fine Travis (2:48 - 2:55)
how was your fine week pretty good like (2:52 - 2:57)
like you intimated at the start of the (2:55 - 3:00)
show now that I have pokemon go I've (2:57 - 3:03)
been playing a lot of it and as i've (3:00 - 3:05)
been playing more of it what I've been (3:03 - 3:08)
surprised to see is that I'm not the (3:05 - 3:12)
only one I thought that Pokemon when (3:08 - 3:14)
Pokemon go became such a huge phenomenon (3:12 - 3:19)
that like many such trends they would (3:14 - 3:21)
die off in a week or two but I see (3:19 - 3:23)
people playing pokemon go still all the (3:21 - 3:25)
time and it's kind of cool I didn't I (3:23 - 3:27)
didn't think it is typically when when (3:25 - 3:30)
you have like and granted not as many (3:27 - 3:31)
people are playing it and you hear (3:30 - 3:33)
people joking like oh you're still (3:31 - 3:36)
playing that game but there's like a lot (3:33 - 3:37)
of people still playing it and i found (3:36 - 3:39)
that kind of surprising and I know I'm (3:37 - 3:41)
not supposed to talk about pokemon in (3:39 - 3:43)
the one but I actually did see video (3:41 - 3:45)
game I'm playing I have a Pokemon ghost (3:43 - 3:48)
story for you as I was out running this (3:45 - 3:50)
morning I came across one of my (3:48 - 3:52)
neighbors and was talking about my trip (3:50 - 3:55)
to Vegas last week and he does like the (3:52 - 3:59)
world championship poker series stuff so (3:55 - 4:00)
he's very familiar with vegas please (3:59 - 4:02)
consistently wearing a baseball hat and (4:00 - 4:07)
sunglasses no but he said oh yeah and (4:02 - 4:09)
when you're in Vegas they have chances (4:07 - 4:11)
if you're still like into pokemon stuff (4:09 - 4:15)
and I was like what's chan cease is that (4:11 - 4:17)
some sort of store or restaurant or (4:15 - 4:19)
something that has like Nintendo theme (4:17 - 4:22)
or something do I need a myself tested (4:19 - 4:24)
when I come back I know but I was like (4:22 - 4:26)
literally like what's chan cease and (4:24 - 4:33)
then I was like oh Chancey you can catch (4:26 - 4:37)
chancy in Pokemon go in Las Vegas when I (4:33 - 4:42)
was like I am the biggest idiot neighbor (4:37 - 4:45)
why's he clearly knew you were into the (4:42 - 4:47)
Pokemon well he's the top (4:45 - 4:49)
pokemon TCG player in Washington DC so (4:47 - 4:51)
and he had just happens to be your (4:49 - 4:54)
neighbor correct interesting all right (4:51 - 4:57)
is she gonna co-host of the show you you (4:54 - 5:01)
know that story I don't think I do oh ya (4:57 - 5:03)
know right I was number one for all that (5:01 - 5:05)
time and then I went to a TCG (5:03 - 5:07)
competition and met this dude who's (5:05 - 5:12)
exactly the same age as me and obviously (5:07 - 5:14)
a better player and I found out his name (5:12 - 5:17)
and it you know then he became the (5:14 - 5:19)
number one player in DC and then I'm (5:17 - 5:21)
like walking my dog down the street and (5:19 - 5:22)
he's like walking up the street and I (5:21 - 5:25)
was like dude with his dog and it's like (5:22 - 5:28)
he's like the other dog than you know he (5:25 - 5:31)
doesn't have a name is Phil he literally (5:28 - 5:35)
lives no he literally lives a hundred (5:31 - 5:38)
feet away from me like not even a mile (5:35 - 5:41)
away a hundred feet away from me we all (5:38 - 5:47)
were left out he also drives the mercury (5:41 - 5:49)
land rover I don't know what you try to (5:47 - 5:52)
stop it's a mercury mariner he doesn't (5:49 - 5:54)
drive one of those either really nice (5:52 - 5:56)
guy I'm sure I'm sure he is I'm sure it (5:54 - 5:58)
is I like to think that there's like a (5:56 - 6:01)
bizarro will living a hundred feet away (5:58 - 6:08)
from you named Phil well um yeah that (6:01 - 6:10)
mattered is my lack of laughter that (6:08 - 6:14)
happened so I the only thing that's been (6:10 - 6:19)
new with me is we just wrapped the first (6:14 - 6:25)
episode of season two of mythical which (6:19 - 6:28)
happened on Tuesday on Twitch do you say (6:25 - 6:30)
wrapped cuz that means completed right (6:28 - 6:32)
well we complete yeah we completed (6:30 - 6:35)
episode one we wrapped against we we (6:32 - 6:37)
wrap that up in a packaged and shipped (6:35 - 6:41)
it so yeah my office is a complete mess (6:37 - 6:44)
because I am actually not in that season (6:41 - 6:49)
but instead will travis's back and Logan (6:44 - 6:51)
is back and (6:49 - 6:54)
Jeff and I which were two characters in (6:51 - 6:56)
season one we are no longer in it for (6:54 - 7:00)
the season we introduced my girlfriend (6:56 - 7:05)
Irene a long old old time Pokemon (7:00 - 7:10)
podcast a purse personnel Aaron who is (7:05 - 7:12)
on first the first / other person (7:10 - 7:15)
besides my voice and erin was was a (7:12 - 7:18)
staple of of it's super effective for (7:15 - 7:21)
probably I want to say like 60 or 70 (7:18 - 7:24)
episodes because he was Aaron is still (7:21 - 7:26)
on Travis when you were still on like (7:24 - 7:28)
you came out you came on round episode (7:26 - 7:30)
30 but yeah there was some overlap yeah (7:28 - 7:33)
yeah but then we got rid of him yeah but (7:30 - 7:37)
no I errands errands super good friend (7:33 - 7:38)
of mine I've known him probably longer (7:37 - 7:42)
than most people and he moved Texas and (7:38 - 7:45)
so he's still very supportive of of what (7:42 - 7:46)
I do and it's super fective and (7:45 - 7:48)
everything and after he listened to you (7:46 - 7:52)
the first season of mythical which is (7:48 - 7:54)
subtitle dungeons of Dragon i'ts he was (7:52 - 7:57)
like man I really wanted mesas and magic (7:54 - 8:01)
arts know her season two okay ah and he (7:57 - 8:02)
was like man I really want to play DD I (8:01 - 8:05)
really want to do that and Aaron and (8:02 - 8:08)
Irene get along really well then air (8:05 - 8:10)
Irene was a little like intimidated (8:08 - 8:11)
because she did she really wanted to do (8:10 - 8:14)
it too so like having Aaron be there and (8:11 - 8:16)
and them knowing each other as long as (8:14 - 8:19)
as they did I was like well they're both (8:16 - 8:21)
new players D&D Travis and Logan can (8:19 - 8:24)
obviously carry their own weight and I (8:21 - 8:28)
think that those four would be a good (8:24 - 8:31)
pairing for a second season and I think (8:28 - 8:33)
you guys did great for I don't know if (8:31 - 8:35)
you wanted to talk about it Travis but (8:33 - 8:37)
you you are not playing your character (8:35 - 8:39)
you played in in season one you're (8:37 - 8:42)
playing a new person right in season one (8:39 - 8:44)
I played Wendy uh who I really like I (8:42 - 8:47)
really liked playing that character but (8:44 - 8:50)
when the prospect of season two came up (8:48 - 8:53)
and the ID well the eye when it was sort (8:50 - 8:55)
of set up in season one that that these (8:53 - 8:59)
characters would likely be used again (8:55 - 9:03)
and in further seasons um I realized (8:59 - 9:04)
that I would need some time off with (9:03 - 9:05)
Wendy before but (9:04 - 9:08)
because I had sort of envisioned her as (9:05 - 9:10)
someone who just has like a lesson to (9:08 - 9:12)
learn and then the character is kind of (9:10 - 9:15)
done is kind of wrapped up and then that (9:12 - 9:17)
happened by the end of the season so I (9:15 - 9:18)
needed some time to figure out what to (9:17 - 9:21)
do with her so I decided I would play (9:18 - 9:25)
someone else for season two so I'm (9:21 - 9:30)
playing um kind of neither of them are (9:25 - 9:32)
very fun people to hang out with but in (9:30 - 9:34)
opposite ways they're also they're both (9:32 - 9:36)
very domineering people but in very (9:34 - 9:40)
opposite ways wendy is um from the (9:36 - 9:44)
nobility so she is very keen on letting (9:40 - 9:45)
you know she's more important than you (9:44 - 9:48)
is the shorthand but i'm playing baruch (9:45 - 9:52)
this time and i won't do the voice on (9:48 - 9:54)
this show you'll have to you'll have to (9:52 - 9:56)
listen to paper down stairs to get to (9:54 - 9:58)
get the magic herbs what did I say (9:56 - 10:02)
monsters you're like the spj character (9:58 - 10:04)
who just can't get the name right oh (10:02 - 10:09)
yeah mazes and monsters is the anti d ye (10:04 - 10:12)
boi yeah ladies that mazes and magic (10:09 - 10:16)
carps is a pun on anyway baruch is very (10:12 - 10:18)
loud he thinks that everyone loves them (10:16 - 10:23)
um he doesn't like solving problems than (10:18 - 10:25)
any other way than smashing them so it's (10:23 - 10:27)
a very different character than Wendy so (10:25 - 10:31)
that's fun um it's also fun going from (10:27 - 10:34)
the the serious character of season one (10:31 - 10:36)
that Wendy was I mean she was funny too (10:34 - 10:39)
sometimes but to completely a comic (10:36 - 10:41)
relief character so may I ask a fan (10:39 - 10:45)
continuity question at this point so (10:41 - 10:47)
when you introduce the character of (10:45 - 10:51)
baruch you say that he's 14 years old (10:47 - 10:54)
but then go on to say that he went to (10:51 - 10:57)
school with stand and no no no no no (10:54 - 11:00)
dances well the way that you described (10:57 - 11:03)
it you said that you he and stant were (11:00 - 11:06)
like old school chums no and when I was (11:03 - 11:09)
like the school together so that we did (11:06 - 11:11)
not say that at all know when baruch was (11:09 - 11:14)
young he knew stant stant was not young (11:11 - 11:16)
at that point the continuity if you (11:14 - 11:18)
really want to get in the back story the (11:16 - 11:19)
idea is that (11:18 - 11:23)
so Baruch comes from this barbarian clan (11:19 - 11:25)
that has it as a tradition that when (11:23 - 11:30)
their kids turn 14 which Baruch is they (11:25 - 11:32)
go on that they're sent off to live with (11:30 - 11:36)
civilized people for for a period of (11:32 - 11:38)
time so that they can learn why their (11:36 - 11:41)
clan chooses not to do that so they can (11:38 - 11:43)
realize that while there's a lot of (11:41 - 11:46)
there might be riches to be found and (11:43 - 11:47)
there might be a lot of luxury in the (11:46 - 11:49)
civilized world that there's also a lot (11:47 - 11:51)
of harshness and unfairness and then (11:49 - 11:54)
it's up to them to decide if they want (11:51 - 11:55)
to stay or not so that's what Baruch is (11:54 - 11:58)
doing but when Baruch was younger he was (11:55 - 12:01)
very curious of things outside of the (11:58 - 12:03)
clan and he would occasionally see this (12:01 - 12:06)
wandering druid named stant Stan Willa (12:03 - 12:08)
which is logan's character um and when (12:06 - 12:10)
Baruch was a kid he would follow stand (12:08 - 12:12)
around and kind of steal his things (12:10 - 12:14)
thinking Stan didn't notice but Stan (12:12 - 12:15)
just thought it was kind of adorable (12:14 - 12:17)
because this little child thought he was (12:15 - 12:19)
getting away with things so that the (12:17 - 12:21)
connection the house yeah that didn't (12:19 - 12:23)
come across at all and it Lea we didn't (12:21 - 12:24)
get all the way into that yeah but yeah (12:23 - 12:27)
it would literally sounded like you guys (12:24 - 12:28)
went to school together and would like (12:27 - 12:30)
do hijinks like stealing people's (12:28 - 12:34)
breakfast together I can just because we (12:30 - 12:36)
didn't really get into the we haven't (12:34 - 12:38)
gotten into the full back story yet that (12:36 - 12:40)
I just explained but yet so I can see (12:38 - 12:41)
where that misconception would come (12:40 - 12:43)
because I was like so he thought had (12:41 - 12:45)
several adult relationships and he can't (12:43 - 12:49)
be 14 years old now we've we've uh Logan (12:45 - 12:51)
and I have had the conversation of (12:49 - 12:55)
figuring out the friendship ? but doing (12:51 - 12:57)
the two of them yeah yeah so that's (12:55 - 13:01)
that's episode one is in iTunes you can (12:57 - 13:04)
just search for mythical or or mazes of (13:01 - 13:06)
magic harps or dungeons and dragon i'ts (13:04 - 13:09)
yeah any of those terms will get you to (13:06 - 13:11)
that podcast in iTunes or it's on (13:09 - 13:13)
soundcloud or stitcher wherever wherever (13:11 - 13:14)
you listen to podcasts if you want to (13:13 - 13:16)
check that out that's really cool the (13:14 - 13:19)
actual episode starts about 45 minutes (13:16 - 13:21)
in the first 45 minutes are them just (13:19 - 13:23)
making their characters and rolling dice (13:21 - 13:27)
and and stuff like that if you care to (13:23 - 13:31)
watch that live it happens every Tuesday (13:27 - 13:33)
on twitch I think there's more (13:31 - 13:34)
one day there's one week where it's (13:33 - 13:35)
going to be a Wednesday but the schedule (13:34 - 13:38)
for that is on the twitch page twitch TV (13:35 - 13:42)
/ PK man castle every Tuesday night 7 (13:38 - 13:45)
p.m. central time we had a pretty good (13:42 - 13:47)
turnout the first night uh-oh and so the (13:45 - 13:49)
reason I brought this up is because my (13:47 - 13:51)
office is a disaster because i have so (13:49 - 13:53)
many monitors and microphones and cables (13:51 - 13:55)
going everywhere because while irene is (13:53 - 13:57)
in it i still need to manage everything (13:55 - 14:01)
through OBS and so I'm like running (13:57 - 14:02)
another monitor and all these cables (14:01 - 14:04)
across the room so my whole that has (14:02 - 14:08)
been my week been a mess but yeah that's (14:04 - 14:10)
that's how we've made that transition to (14:08 - 14:12)
where we are now I think that's good (14:10 - 14:15)
right we made it we're here we're here (14:12 - 14:20)
to bring you some Pokemon news lost my (14:15 - 14:26)
articles here we go all right first bit (14:20 - 14:28)
of news is there is a Pokemon Sun and (14:26 - 14:35)
Moon branded new Nintendo 3ds XL that is (14:28 - 14:37)
going to be coming out before the games (14:35 - 14:40)
yeah where's the date yes that is (14:37 - 14:44)
available on october twenty eighth it is (14:40 - 14:46)
the sole galiyo luna la black edition (14:44 - 14:49)
new Nintendo 3ds that will come out (14:46 - 14:51)
slightly before Pokemon Sun and Moon (14:49 - 14:52)
which is November eighteenth if you (14:51 - 14:55)
forgot it will retail that same cost as (14:52 - 15:00)
other 3d asses at one 9999 United States (14:55 - 15:03)
money and it doesn't come with a copy of (15:00 - 15:04)
the game because why would it because (15:03 - 15:06)
first off it's it's coming up before (15:04 - 15:09)
that and secondly I feel like every (15:06 - 15:11)
special edition nintendo 3ds no longer (15:09 - 15:13)
comes with games like the mana sometimes (15:11 - 15:16)
they do sometimes they don't the but (15:13 - 15:19)
definitely the X&Y special edition 3dsxl (15:16 - 15:21)
s did not come with a copy of the game (15:19 - 15:23)
the animal crossing one did yeah i think (15:21 - 15:27)
the majora's mask one did not come with (15:23 - 15:29)
the copy of the game well maybe it did (15:27 - 15:33)
huh can we talk about how beautiful this (15:29 - 15:38)
new 3ds XL is it's okay i am kind of (15:33 - 15:39)
happy that they're only coming out with (15:38 - 15:41)
one because with x and y they had the (15:39 - 15:44)
blue one and the red one and the red one (15:41 - 15:46)
was obviously superior but now you don't (15:44 - 15:47)
have to make (15:46 - 15:49)
choice of which one you're going to get (15:47 - 15:53)
it's just one I it I have right now the (15:49 - 15:57)
the monster hunter new 3ds and before (15:53 - 16:00)
that I had the special edition yellow (15:57 - 16:04)
Pikachu 3ds and I've seen all the XFC (16:00 - 16:06)
and all the X&Y wands and the black the (16:04 - 16:08)
pokemon black and white ones and (16:06 - 16:12)
everything I am just not a fan of them (16:08 - 16:16)
using the standard PNG art and just (16:12 - 16:20)
throwing it on like Pikachu 3ds is (16:16 - 16:24)
specific for a JPEG right but give me (16:20 - 16:26)
some jpg don't give me any so the (16:24 - 16:29)
pikachu three yes like that design is (16:26 - 16:31)
specific to the 3ds I mean yeah it's (16:29 - 16:34)
just a Pikachu had blown up but like you (16:31 - 16:37)
I couldn't just Google that art and find (16:34 - 16:39)
it like that's so gay leo and luna la is (16:37 - 16:41)
your is what we've seen them in every (16:39 - 16:43)
pose the only difference is it's it's a (16:41 - 16:45)
stencil art but it's the same exact (16:43 - 16:47)
image and they did that with black and (16:45 - 16:48)
white and they did that with x and y (16:47 - 16:50)
where it was just like here's a sec Rob (16:48 - 16:52)
and here's rush Ryman is the same exact (16:50 - 16:54)
thing you would see on bulbapedia same (16:52 - 16:58)
with Eva Thailand exert eNOS I don't (16:54 - 17:00)
know I just want Allah I'm just being (16:58 - 17:01)
I'm just being picky when it comes to (17:00 - 17:03)
designs like I just would prefer (17:01 - 17:06)
something more custom instead of just (17:03 - 17:08)
your standard silhouette well you're (17:06 - 17:10)
right because they the one that they (17:08 - 17:13)
came out with it was Japan only that we (17:10 - 17:15)
really should still be furious that we (17:13 - 17:17)
didn't get was the one that had the (17:15 - 17:22)
artwork of it was the gold 3ds XL or l (17:17 - 17:26)
with the likes of the silhouette of (17:22 - 17:28)
xerneas and then all the trees and then (17:26 - 17:30)
the starters were up in the trees and (17:28 - 17:33)
then the back side had yveltal like over (17:30 - 17:36)
some mountains and that up ryder's now (17:33 - 17:39)
be so beautiful some legit 3s art why (17:36 - 17:41)
don't we get that like I'm looking at (17:39 - 17:42)
the red and blue ones there they're (17:41 - 17:45)
literally the art assets that that (17:42 - 17:47)
Pokemon sends out to everyone up like (17:45 - 17:49)
here's what here's your official PMG of (17:47 - 17:53)
of xerneas this is you people keep (17:49 - 17:56)
buying it every time hey I didn't buy (17:53 - 17:59)
those yeah I actually bought two of (17:56 - 18:01)
those who you bought both of them i (17:59 - 18:03)
bought the red one for myself and the (18:01 - 18:05)
blue one has a gift for someone else i'm (18:03 - 18:07)
not saying that i'm not saying the (18:05 - 18:10)
monster hunter 3 d s is is that great (18:07 - 18:13)
like the mice are newer 3ds is just a (18:10 - 18:15)
close up of some monsters fur and then (18:13 - 18:17)
it's just one of the monster hunter (18:15 - 18:19)
symbols I'm not sure which monster that (18:17 - 18:22)
is but but that gold pokemon 3d ass that (18:19 - 18:25)
one's legit the one we never get so (18:22 - 18:28)
that's coming out if you don't have a (18:25 - 18:34)
new 3ds XL it might be worth upgrading (18:28 - 18:36)
if you like to collect pokemon stuff (18:34 - 18:40)
that the new 3ds doesn't do anything tak (18:36 - 18:42)
right no games use that little nub (18:40 - 18:44)
besides like monster hunter and one (18:42 - 18:47)
other game no no one plays with the 3d (18:44 - 18:49)
on anymore do you play with the 3d on (18:47 - 18:52)
we'll head sometimes sometimes i do (18:49 - 18:54)
sometimes I don't but I do use that (18:52 - 18:55)
little nubby and monster hunter all the (18:54 - 19:00)
time really dia so I originally got um (18:55 - 19:04)
like a shell because when I play monster (19:00 - 19:06)
hunter like my hands cramp it's like one (19:04 - 19:07)
of the game it's not like you're playing (19:06 - 19:09)
pokemon where your you could play (19:07 - 19:11)
pokemon with a des on the table and just (19:09 - 19:14)
kind of you know what I mean yep we're (19:11 - 19:16)
motsognir you're like ripping it and (19:14 - 19:17)
you're holding down multiple buttons and (19:16 - 19:19)
all that stuff so my hands started (19:17 - 19:21)
cramping when I play monster so I got a (19:19 - 19:24)
grip on the grip was nice but it I have (19:21 - 19:26)
smaller hands so I couldn't actually (19:24 - 19:29)
reach the nub comfortably any more so (19:26 - 19:32)
because of that I learned to just use (19:29 - 19:35)
the L button a lot which refocuses the (19:32 - 19:36)
camera behind you (19:35 - 19:38)
so I stopped using the nub completely (19:36 - 19:40)
then fast forward to like two weeks ago (19:38 - 19:43)
where I got a better grip the official (19:40 - 19:47)
monster hunter generations grip and I (19:43 - 19:49)
can't reach the nub again but since I've (19:47 - 19:52)
taught myself how to use the L button I (19:49 - 19:54)
never use the little nubbin II more at (19:52 - 19:56)
all I'm nope I'm not free got that nub (19:54 - 20:01)
free life you say potato I say I don't (19:56 - 20:04)
eat a lot of starches love starch let me (20:01 - 20:07)
tell you what you do let me tell you (20:04 - 20:11)
about some more starch there are new Sun (20:07 - 20:13)
and Moon cards coming to the trading (20:11 - 20:17)
card came that's a bet transition I was (20:13 - 20:19)
waiting for it I had hope I hi ho who's (20:17 - 20:22)
the potato pokemon i would say grubbin (20:19 - 20:26)
no he that's not a vegetable he's I'm (20:22 - 20:28)
sure he's full of starch (20:26 - 20:31)
and electricity I demand a potato (20:28 - 20:34)
pokemon in the lolla region all right a (20:31 - 20:37)
lulling me out and grubbin are the first (20:34 - 20:41)

trading card game in Japan the Sun and (20:41 - 20:45)
Moon collection will be releasing (20:44 - 20:48)

a dark-type and it shows grubbin which (20:50 - 20:56)
is grass neither have anything's (20:52 - 20:58)
fantastic about them they're just kind (20:56 - 21:01)
of base cards grubbin is shown to move (20:58 - 21:03)
to have the move vice grip so maybe (21:01 - 21:06)
that's something to take that hey (21:03 - 21:08)
possibly that line in the game will know (21:06 - 21:11)
vice grip if you like if you like cards (21:08 - 21:14)
they're coming yeah I'll probably go to (21:11 - 21:17)
a tee TCG pre-release in January just to (21:14 - 21:18)
have fun I like to go to the (21:17 - 21:19)
pre-releases because it's kind of like (21:18 - 21:23)
low commitment and fun yeah worried (21:19 - 21:25)
you're not like completely stressed out (21:23 - 21:29)
and you'll leave with something yo yeah (21:25 - 21:31)
there's nothing more stressful in my (21:29 - 21:33)
life than playing pokemon cards it is (21:31 - 21:35)
stressful because everyone so mean (21:33 - 21:38)
you've never been to an official (21:35 - 21:40)

explosive speed that people claim it can (23:02 - 23:08)
dodge lightning it is said that any (23:05 - 23:12)
Pokemon that sees you be zero to beauty (23:08 - 23:15)
regardless of its own gender will become (23:12 - 23:19)
infatuated with it and lose the will to (23:15 - 23:22)
battle it is undetermined whether it's (23:19 - 23:28)
due to pheromones it exudes or a (23:22 - 23:30)
hypotonic effect induced by its (23:28 - 23:35)
appearance hypnotic hypnotic yep Hypno's (23:30 - 23:38)
yes solid in the trailer you Bo 2 is (23:35 - 23:40)
Dean coming into the ole ola region (23:38 - 23:42)
through a portal in fighting taboo cocoa (23:40 - 23:46)
in front of hawa but they also showed (23:42 - 23:49)
absorption yeah you Bo you said you Bo 2 (23:46 - 23:52)
that's right yes words (23:49 - 23:56)
so as so Andrew Andrew since i which i (23:52 - 23:58)
think is this twitter name but andrew (23:56 - 24:00)
and slag wrecked (23:58 - 24:04)
mentioned that the that so far the three (24:00 - 24:08)
ubs we've seen were based off pests both (24:04 - 24:12)
ubo to look like well you be absorption (24:08 - 24:16)
looks like a mosquito you bo2 looks like (24:12 - 24:18)
what like a roach does look like a (24:16 - 24:20)
cockroach yeah it's got like two long (24:18 - 24:23)
antlers and then the sort of back part (24:20 - 24:25)
looks like a cockroach show yeah and (24:23 - 24:27)
then the first ones more of like a (24:25 - 24:30)
jellyfish and he then linked in our look (24:27 - 24:32)
cuz when you think pests you don't (24:30 - 24:33)
really think of jellyfish right off the (24:32 - 24:37)
bat you think of more like my sir or (24:33 - 24:39)
well it depends on how much you swim in (24:37 - 24:42)
the ocean but I've ever not been able to (24:39 - 24:43)
swim in the ocean because there was a (24:42 - 24:45)
field of jellyfish coming through you'd (24:43 - 24:48)
understand when I think of pests I think (24:45 - 24:51)
of like rats or people that try to talk (24:48 - 24:54)
to me about Game of Thrones yeah but (24:51 - 24:57)
yeah so we heal so he linked an article (24:54 - 24:59)
that it's that pretty much said that I (24:57 - 25:01)
think it was Britain had like a (24:59 - 25:04)
jellyfish problem recently and they kept (25:01 - 25:06)
referring to them as pests and blah blah (25:04 - 25:09)
blah but I guess that's that's kind of (25:06 - 25:11)
this new thing we're more jellyfish oven (25:09 - 25:16)
uh bothering more shorelines I finally (25:11 - 25:18)
read the article once it was like a week (25:16 - 25:20)
or two ago but I don't know it kind of (25:18 - 25:22)
makes sense no one really likes (25:20 - 25:27)
mosquitoes or or roaches or (25:22 - 25:29)
jellyfish-like i can i can think of (25:27 - 25:32)
jellyfish is great and beautiful when (25:29 - 25:34)
it's at a zoo behind glass and they're (25:32 - 25:37)
floating peacefully I probably wouldn't (25:34 - 25:39)
want to swim next to one yeah if you've (25:37 - 25:42)
ever been touched by a Portuguese Man O (25:39 - 25:46)
War you would know what true pain is ok (25:42 - 25:48)
because I don't I guess yeah a lot of (25:46 - 25:50)
people who haven't spent a lot of time (25:48 - 25:51)
around the ocean may not know that (25:50 - 25:55)
jellyfish have like this their their (25:51 - 26:00)
tentacles that fall off of them are like (25:55 - 26:02)
exude I don't know if it's a poison or (26:00 - 26:06)
something but is extremely painful if it (26:02 - 26:07)
touches you in Portuguese man-of-war is (26:06 - 26:11)
the worst and the most painful yeah so (26:07 - 26:15)
prior to the recent trailer that showed (26:11 - 26:19)
these eubie eubie Oh tues off I probably (26:15 - 26:23)
would have been more leaning towards the (26:19 - 26:28)
ultra beast line was maybe something not (26:23 - 26:32)
catchable because pokemon (26:28 - 26:35)
CPI still has not used the word Pokemon (26:32 - 26:38)
when talking about ultra bees correct (26:35 - 26:42)
but when they came through the portal (26:38 - 26:47)
and started to fight pappu cocoa that (26:42 - 26:53)
really solidified to me that oh these (26:47 - 26:55)
are maybe that these are considered (26:53 - 26:58)
quote-unquote legendary beasts like they (26:55 - 27:01)
did with the with like anti and stuff (26:58 - 27:03)
and they're just using the term ultra (27:01 - 27:06)
beast for now but it may like that (27:03 - 27:08)
trailer made it seem like okay like (27:06 - 27:10)
their version exclusive they're probably (27:08 - 27:13)
catchable I was wondering if they are (27:10 - 27:18)
not catchable in the act like bosses in (27:13 - 27:21)
between gyms or something like that oh (27:18 - 27:24)
so like in like getting rid of the gyms (27:21 - 27:26)
having the four islands and then these (27:24 - 27:28)
possibly being like causes i I I (27:26 - 27:31)
wouldn't can I didn't consider getting (27:28 - 27:32)
rid I was just thinking of them like (27:31 - 27:36)
okay you know pokemon X&Y had that long (27:32 - 27:39)
stretch between forget if it's gyms one (27:36 - 27:43)
and two or two and three um but may but (27:39 - 27:45)
like you can imagine if you put like a (27:43 - 27:46)
boss fight in the middle there it (27:45 - 27:50)
wouldn't feel as long of a stretch and i (27:46 - 27:52)
was wondering it and my my thought is (27:50 - 27:55)
that they might put these in between a (27:52 - 27:58)
few gems to spice things up in the same (27:55 - 28:00)
way that they typically do with rival (27:58 - 28:03)
teams have a chunk of the game in (28:00 - 28:06)
between a few of the gyms hmm well or (28:03 - 28:08)
think you're right you think so you (28:06 - 28:10)
don't think i'm sorry do you guys think (28:08 - 28:12)
they're catchable or know that this (28:10 - 28:13)
you're gonna go I don't liked it yeah I (28:12 - 28:14)
don't think they're going to be (28:13 - 28:16)
catchable and I do believe they are part (28:14 - 28:20)
of the story the overall story and and (28:16 - 28:24)
yeah just like how in black and white (28:20 - 28:27)
you had the interlacing of the story (28:24 - 28:29)
between the gyms and you had to do like (28:27 - 28:32)
the the sage battles and stuff as a boss (28:29 - 28:35)
battle between the gyms that this is (28:32 - 28:38)
going to be along those lines alright (28:35 - 28:39)
you'll have to have an ultra beast (28:38 - 28:41)
encounter and get past the encounter (28:39 - 28:43)
before you can move on to whatever your (28:41 - 28:46)
next thing is going to be and I (28:43 - 28:49)
GX I just think I feel like the ultra (28:46 - 28:53)
beasts are somehow extra dimensional so (28:49 - 28:56)
that the rules of the Pokemon world's (28:53 - 28:57)
don't really apply to them and you're (28:56 - 28:59)
actually coming across and into the (28:57 - 29:03)
Pokemon you don't think like d axis is (28:59 - 29:07)
extra dimensional DX s is from space and (29:03 - 29:10)
the axis is a what not a bacteria what (29:07 - 29:12)
are they what about iris what about who (29:10 - 29:16)
is Koopas whole gimmick is it like (29:12 - 29:20)
creates dimensions know who pajama deck (29:16 - 29:23)
is that it bridges time and space but is (29:20 - 29:25)
it that it alleged image it manipulates (29:23 - 29:28)
dimensions it doesn't come from another (29:25 - 29:33)
dimension okay so if if they are Pokemon (29:28 - 29:34)
and they're catchable I mean that's (29:33 - 29:36)
that's what it comes down to write every (29:34 - 29:38)
pokemon is catchable correct and that I (29:36 - 29:41)
would say that's evidence for the theory (29:38 - 29:42)
that they are not catchable because it (29:41 - 29:44)
seems like they would call them pokemon (29:42 - 29:47)
x now if if that were the case also I (29:44 - 29:49)
just want to make the point that you Bo (29:47 - 29:53)
to absorption is extremely unsettling (29:49 - 29:57)
because if it's like 20 mouth because (29:53 - 29:59)
it's like a Johnny Bravo mosquito I (29:57 - 30:05)
don't want yes to they did mention that (29:59 - 30:07)
there are more ultra beasts than this (30:05 - 30:11)
that was because I'm you bo seven that (30:07 - 30:13)
there so that was something that was (30:11 - 30:16)
pointed out in the trailer that I think (30:13 - 30:18)
they said like there could possibly be (30:16 - 30:21)
even more altar abuse or something very (30:18 - 30:24)
generic like that do we wanna do we want (30:21 - 30:26)
to touch on the gender thing there's a (30:24 - 30:30)
gender thing yeah so you bo2 is beauty (30:26 - 30:32)
and then this is regardless of its own (30:30 - 30:34)
gender regardless of its own gender will (30:32 - 30:36)
become and flash to it it will become (30:34 - 30:38)
infatuated with it and will lose any (30:36 - 30:41)
Pokemon that sees it regardless of its (30:38 - 30:43)
gender so male Pokemon female Pokemon (30:41 - 30:48)
i'm assuming genderless pokemon us do (30:43 - 30:50)
you think that well I'm going to say I (30:48 - 30:52)
think that's cool do you think that's a (30:50 - 30:57)
response to the amount of gender talk (30:52 - 31:01)
that's kind of happened in 2015 2016 or (30:57 - 31:03)
that there is some real lower behind (31:01 - 31:06)
that because if there's lore behind that (31:03 - 31:08)
they're going to be looking at more so (31:06 - 31:11)
something in myth or in legends that (31:08 - 31:15)
would state that you know anything is I (31:11 - 31:18)
just use something like Medusa no matter (31:15 - 31:21)
whatever whatever legend or store you're (31:18 - 31:23)
told if you look at medusa you become (31:21 - 31:26)
stone right I wouldn't I do not think (31:23 - 31:30)
that this is an attempt to be (31:26 - 31:32)
progressive or anything like that in (31:30 - 31:35)
fact it's if that were the case it would (31:32 - 31:37)
be incredibly strange to try to be (31:35 - 31:41)
progressive about gender by saying here (31:37 - 31:45)
here is a monster that all monsters are (31:41 - 31:46)
attracted silly (31:45 - 31:48)
that is that doesn't mean anything well (31:46 - 31:51)
that's all I wanted to bring it up I I (31:48 - 31:53)
think it's more your second idea that (31:51 - 31:56)
it's probably pulling from some (31:53 - 31:57)
mythology that doesn't come immediately (31:56 - 31:58)
to the top of my head but just this (31:57 - 32:04)
general idea of I guess that beauty is (31:58 - 32:08)
thinking about it in as this like (32:04 - 32:12)
Platonic ideal that there is some (32:08 - 32:16)
concept of pure beauty of a beauty (32:12 - 32:18)
that's undeniable regardless of your (32:16 - 32:20)
proclivities I think is maybe the idea (32:18 - 32:22)
that they're they're going for I don't (32:20 - 32:25)
think this is progressive is yeah we're (32:22 - 32:27)
like some attempted inclusivity because (32:25 - 32:30)
if it were it would be very strange i (32:27 - 32:34)
would say in any way that it's would (32:30 - 32:37)
refer possibly to the six different (32:34 - 32:39)
types of love that were expressed in (32:37 - 32:43)
greek ancient greek which of course (32:39 - 32:45)
everyone is familiar with yeah i mean i (32:43 - 32:46)
have my ancient greek book right in (32:45 - 32:51)
front of me yet your eros your go far (32:46 - 32:54)
you love your arrows felis or whatever (32:51 - 32:59)
the brothers one is Athena Athena one (32:54 - 33:02)
that's a god that's a great name dropped (32:59 - 33:06)
after two there's the agape I get you (33:02 - 33:08)
gotta got back you been good you pit (33:06 - 33:12)
that's one you got them all right let's (33:08 - 33:14)
put everyone out of their misery there (33:12 - 33:16)
is eros which is physical i would say (33:14 - 33:18)
three is pretty good for someone who has (33:16 - 33:21)
like said oh you are training library (33:18 - 33:23)
pathology except you studied philosophy (33:21 - 33:26)
which is highly based in knowledge of (33:23 - 33:29)
Greek society anyways eros being (33:26 - 33:33)
physical only filia which is a very (33:29 - 33:38)
strong friendship ludus which is playful (33:33 - 33:41)
or flirting agape which is your overall (33:38 - 33:44)
love for Humanity in the world pragma (33:41 - 33:47)
which is love that has lasted for a long (33:44 - 33:49)
time and this one's hard to pronounce (33:47 - 33:53)
but latia which is the love you feel for (33:49 - 33:57)
yourself have a lot of that (33:53 - 34:03)
you could say that you bo2 inspires a (33:57 - 34:06)
feeling of filia which would make you (34:03 - 34:10)
not want to attack it is a type of love (34:06 - 34:14)
okay no that's awesome I'm that that (34:10 - 34:17)
sounds better than anything we've had up (34:14 - 34:21)
to this point bizarre gender politics (34:17 - 34:23)
hmm yeah so yeah there you go there's (34:21 - 34:26)
your to you bees they're the same in (34:23 - 34:33)
some aspect I I still it's it's clear (34:26 - 34:35)
that pole (34:33 - 34:38)
has shown us very specific things of the (34:35 - 34:41)
ubs with the intention that there is (34:38 - 34:44)
just not enough information the words (34:41 - 34:46)
they've chosen the the images they've (34:44 - 34:49)
shown even the trailer is very specific (34:46 - 34:53)
to enough to cause speculation but not (34:49 - 34:56)
enough to validate anyone speculation (34:53 - 34:57)
yeah it's clear that we're all very (34:56 - 34:59)
confused about what the UVs are and what (34:57 - 35:02)
they mean I think that's what's clear I (34:59 - 35:05)
think the extra dimensional aspect that (35:02 - 35:07)
you mentioned that definitely gets (35:05 - 35:08)
conjured up in my mind as well when I (35:07 - 35:10)
think of these things comes from the (35:08 - 35:14)
naming convention of you bo1 you bo to (35:10 - 35:16)
it sounds like some sort of government (35:14 - 35:18)
classification that's hidden away in an (35:16 - 35:22)
archive that that that we weren't (35:18 - 35:24)
supposed to know about like some sort of (35:22 - 35:29)
x-files thing like warehouse 13 sure (35:24 - 35:32)
I'm not that show is that that show (35:29 - 35:33)
we're like it's just a big warehouse and (35:32 - 35:37)
I find like spooky things every week it (35:33 - 35:39)
basically yes that sounds like a good (35:37 - 35:40)
job I think I think my mom like that (35:39 - 35:44)
show I loved that show it was also in (35:40 - 35:47)
the same universe as shoot what's the (35:44 - 35:50)
town it was like the town on the west (35:47 - 35:53)
coast Eureka or whatever yeah and those (35:50 - 36:00)
two shows with the bomb all right well (35:53 - 36:02)
transitions exist I don't have a good (36:00 - 36:05)
one but when we come back we're going to (36:02 - 36:08)
be talking about the to YouTube trailers (36:05 - 36:12)
for pokemon not trailers shorts animated (36:08 - 36:16)
shorts for pokemon generation (36:12 - 36:16)
and we are back from our break to talk (36:36 - 36:46)
about Pokemon generations Hank this is a (36:42 - 36:49)
yeah 18 episodes so if you don't know (36:46 - 36:51)
what this is Pokemon generations looks (36:49 - 36:53)
back at each generation of the Pokemon (36:51 - 36:55)
video game series diving into the (36:53 - 36:57)
stories of the games more deeply and (36:55 - 36:59)
getting to know the characters and the (36:57 - 37:02)
Pokemon better visit each region from (36:59 - 37:05)
Kanto to Kalos to relive the world of (37:02 - 37:07)
Pokemon like never before Pokemon (37:05 - 37:10)
generations will consist of 18 episodes (37:07 - 37:13)
each running between three and five (37:10 - 37:15)
minutes in length the first two episodes (37:13 - 37:18)
while launched September 16th which was (37:15 - 37:21)
couple days ago and then they show just (37:18 - 37:24)
this trailer that looked very much in (37:21 - 37:30)
the style of pokemon origins and yeah we (37:24 - 37:32)
have the first two trailers now I think (37:30 - 37:33)
all of us have watched them i watch them (37:32 - 37:35)
twice i watch them actually right before (37:33 - 37:37)
we recorded just the first two episodes (37:35 - 37:40)
first two episodes yes I don't know if (37:37 - 37:42)
there's like an overarching premise here (37:40 - 37:44)
let me just read what the youtube (37:42 - 37:48)
comment says or the YouTube synopsis so (37:44 - 37:51)
all these are on YouTube they're on you (37:48 - 37:53)
can just go to youtube.com slash Pokemon (37:51 - 37:56)
it's on the official page the first (37:53 - 37:59)
episode which is titled the adventure is (37:56 - 38:02)
from Viridian Forest to terminus cave (37:59 - 38:05)
see the Pokemon world as never before oh (38:02 - 38:07)
this is where i read this is where i (38:05 - 38:09)
read it put my generation revisits each (38:07 - 38:11)
generation of Pokemon video game to shed (38:09 - 38:14)
new light and some new light on some (38:11 - 38:17)
timeless moments from early day in canto (38:14 - 38:20)
to the splendor of the Kalos region go (38:17 - 38:22)
behind the scenes and witness Pokemon (38:20 - 38:23)
history with new eyes these bites I'd (38:22 - 38:25)
adventures are three to five minutes (38:23 - 38:28)
song will be released every week through (38:25 - 38:32)
December 23rd so it will end on december (38:28 - 38:34)
twenty third there you go so I feel like (38:32 - 38:37)
that's two a week yeah probably because (38:34 - 38:42)
it's about 9 mm its not 80s december (38:37 - 38:45)
four weeks weeks to christmas i guess (38:42 - 38:47)
what do i need to start my christmas (38:45 - 38:50)
shopping now four weeks in december four (38:47 - 38:50)
weeks (38:50 - 38:52)
let's talk about math here november in (38:50 - 38:55)
four weeks in october oh that's 16 i (38:52 - 38:58)
guess no that's 12 that's 12 and we (38:55 - 39:01)
still have a to each in Friday's left in (38:58 - 39:05)
September that's 14 and then your did (39:01 - 39:06)
you already count the weeks into (39:05 - 39:08)
December that this will be because it (39:06 - 39:10)
doesn't end December first or whatever (39:08 - 39:12)
yeah yeah I can't discount Reuters so (39:10 - 39:15)
that must mean that there are two there (39:12 - 39:17)
would be two episodes not release at (39:15 - 39:20)
that schedule so I'm assuming that what (39:17 - 39:24)
wonder what two weeks out of the next 14 (39:20 - 39:28)
will have an extra episode well no also (39:24 - 39:31)
keep in mind so right we just counted 14 (39:28 - 39:34)
weeks plus the two that have already (39:31 - 39:36)
aired that's so that brings us up to 16 (39:34 - 39:40)
so then yeah one week has or two weeks (39:36 - 39:42)
have two extra episode sure why not yeah (39:40 - 39:45)
that's what I said okay so the first (39:42 - 39:48)
episode already has 3.5 million views on (39:45 - 39:50)
YouTube I think that's the only way to (39:48 - 39:53)
watch it it opens with version of (39:50 - 39:57)
pokemon red very similar to how pokemon (39:53 - 40:02)
origins opened and then right away as (39:57 - 40:05)
every great trainer does encounters a (40:02 - 40:07)
pikachu doesn't do any damage just goes (40:05 - 40:09)
to the item slot right away selects the (40:07 - 40:12)
poké ball catches the Pikachu and that (40:09 - 40:17)
is when we transition into the animation (40:12 - 40:22)
which is very good animation and we also (40:17 - 40:27)
see a not a new design but a differently (40:22 - 40:31)
drawn Pikachu a different interpretation (40:27 - 40:35)
yes it has a little chubbier I think (40:31 - 40:38)
it's a bit more rounder of a head yeah a (40:35 - 40:43)
bit more mouse than other yeah that's a (40:38 - 40:46)
great way to describe late it I liked (40:43 - 40:49)
this episode a lot (40:46 - 40:52)
I think I'll just give the part of the (40:49 - 40:54)
basic premise and we can break that down (40:52 - 40:59)
it starts with an unknown trainer (40:54 - 41:03)
and really besides the initial picking (40:59 - 41:05)
up the pokeball the trainer has nothing (41:03 - 41:09)
to do with this story and I like that we (41:05 - 41:14)
see the pikachu go from region to region (41:09 - 41:16)
few places that we've all been (41:14 - 41:18)
throughout the series and battled (41:16 - 41:21)
pokemon in a way we haven't seen really (41:18 - 41:23)
happen (41:21 - 41:26)
and the tray how does the trailer the (41:23 - 41:30)
trailer ends with Pikachu attacking the (41:26 - 41:34)
Pikachu encountering as I guard correct (41:30 - 41:37)
and so when it's back with the trainer (41:34 - 41:41)
at that point yeah (41:37 - 41:41)
sigh guard complete form which hasn't (41:41 - 41:47)
been really been shown before right we (41:44 - 41:49)
see use i guard power up and then the (41:47 - 41:52)
the camera pans into the sky and it (41:49 - 41:54)
comes down and says Pokemon generation I (41:52 - 41:56)
would I would actually say that this (41:54 - 42:00)
would this is more of an episode 0 in my (41:56 - 42:03)
eyes this is just a you would show this (42:00 - 42:06)
to maybe somebody who is very high on (42:03 - 42:08)
Pokemon go but hasn't played pokemon (42:06 - 42:10)
since the 90s you would show this to (42:08 - 42:12)
somebody who you know is maybe currently (42:10 - 42:14)
playing red or blue on their iPhone or (42:12 - 42:16)
something or their computer because they (42:14 - 42:19)
jailbroke it or whatever obviously this (42:16 - 42:23)
is fanfare for us being poked for loving (42:19 - 42:27)
Pokemon but there's no real story here (42:23 - 42:30)
it's more of a remember everything (42:27 - 42:33)
you've done up to this point (42:30 - 42:36)
I think that's a very good way to (42:33 - 42:40)
describe almost with taking away the (42:36 - 42:41)
second comment I think that's a very (42:40 - 42:42)
good way to describe both of the (42:41 - 42:45)
episodes seem we've seen so far they're (42:42 - 42:47)
pretty light on story they're more like (42:45 - 42:51)
little vistas into the Pokemon world and (42:47 - 42:54)
nods to things we know from the games (42:51 - 42:56)
but and I would say the underlying (42:54 - 42:59)
subtext of the first one the adventure (42:56 - 43:04)
is the reminder that right you well I (42:59 - 43:06)
mean technically you couldn't have but (43:04 - 43:09)
that Pikachu that you caught in Viridian (43:06 - 43:11)
Forest you could have had with you (43:09 - 43:15)
through all of this time and is now you (43:11 - 43:18)
know like up to the point of x and y you (43:15 - 43:20)
could have had that Pikachu with you (43:18 - 43:23)
battling by your side the entire time (43:20 - 43:25)
right through all the generations I (43:23 - 43:29)
think if you break down the battles more (43:25 - 43:31)
clearly those battles themselves are (43:29 - 43:34)
telling individual stories I think (43:31 - 43:37)
encountering a Pikachu when we all (43:34 - 43:39)
played red and blue for the first time I (43:37 - 43:41)
think was probably the most exciting (43:39 - 43:46)
thing we we had right because when you (43:41 - 43:48)
got the game you new kind of which (43:46 - 43:50)
starter you were getting the excitement (43:48 - 43:52)
wasn't there it was oh my god i want (43:50 - 43:54)
bubble sir well no one said that oh my (43:52 - 43:55)
god i want Charmander oh my god i want (43:54 - 43:58)
squirtle bright and then to me i (43:55 - 44:00)
remember very distinctly playing these (43:58 - 44:03)
games and going the first Pokemon I want (44:00 - 44:04)
to catch is Pikachu right because the (44:03 - 44:08)
anime was such a big crutch at the time (44:04 - 44:10)
of like the anime is what how I (44:08 - 44:12)
discovered Pokemon yeah but you also (44:10 - 44:15)
used a master ball on a gold duck so he (44:12 - 44:17)
has attempted univer universalize your (44:15 - 44:19)
experience and I also started with (44:17 - 44:21)
pokemon yellow so I started with a (44:19 - 44:24)
Pikachu okay (44:21 - 44:27)
so no I do I do recognize that because (44:24 - 44:30)
Pikachu is the first but if memory (44:27 - 44:32)
serves is the first Pokemon that you (44:30 - 44:35)
encounter that has a low encounter rate (44:32 - 44:38)
because it's hard to find the EF I think (44:35 - 44:41)
back I think that all the pokemon you (44:38 - 44:44)
see up to that point are pretty easy to (44:41 - 44:46)
find like they have a look at the lowest (44:44 - 44:47)
probably like a thirty percent chance of (44:46 - 44:49)
seeing them or something so it's it's (44:47 - 44:51)
like they're pretty easy to find and (44:49 - 44:52)
then I think doesn't Pikachu have like a (44:51 - 44:54)
five percent chance and really in forest (44:52 - 44:56)
yeah that's the first time you find them (44:54 - 44:59)
is in Viridian Forest and yeah it's the (44:56 - 45:01)
hardest one to find in that area i think (44:59 - 45:05)
you have wheedle and PG and Caterpie (45:01 - 45:06)
which are all very easy to find then you (45:05 - 45:08)
have guna and Metapod which are slightly (45:06 - 45:10)
harder to find and then you have piqued (45:08 - 45:14)
so it's your first experience with (45:10 - 45:17)
rarity in the game really yeah we move (45:14 - 45:18)
on to the second battle which is in (45:17 - 45:21)
johto we see Pikachu battling three (45:18 - 45:23)
Wooper I don't know why Pikachu is (45:21 - 45:25)
battling three Wooper and since 11 / (45:23 - 45:27)
that's all right but we see Pikachu (45:25 - 45:29)
Thunder shock these Wooper and the (45:27 - 45:32)
expression on Pikachu's faces that (45:29 - 45:35)
didn't work these Wooper on water waters (45:32 - 45:37)
week to electricity again I think that (45:35 - 45:39)
is a throwback of our first experience (45:37 - 45:43)
in johto and really seeing new types (45:39 - 45:45)
that was the first time we saw if i'm (45:43 - 45:48)
not mistaken a water ground I water type (45:45 - 45:50)
that is not weak to electric yes I (45:48 - 45:53)
believe that the looper is that first of (45:50 - 45:56)
that correct we move on to everyone's (45:53 - 45:58)
favorite generation 3 where we see a (45:56 - 45:59)
wait wait wait wait wait wait you're (45:58 - 46:02)
skipping something important after the (45:59 - 46:04)
loopers strike back at Pikachu and he's (46:02 - 46:06)
falling off the tree he bounces off of (46:04 - 46:09)
lugia yeah this vigeous you that I think (46:06 - 46:11)
it's funny because they use they use the (46:09 - 46:14)
legendary pokemon as the transition so (46:11 - 46:17)
from Caterpie to Wooper we see a zapdos (46:14 - 46:20)
from looper to Vigoroth rasiya lugia (46:17 - 46:23)
it's just that's how they cleverly hid (46:20 - 46:26)
transitions which i think is fine we go (46:23 - 46:29)
to the Hoenn weather Institute we see (46:26 - 46:31)
Pikachu battling of Vigoroth I don't (46:29 - 46:35)
have much memory with with generation 3 (46:31 - 46:38)
I played it after generation 4 (46:35 - 46:41)
so I'm not when I when I see the weather (46:38 - 46:42)
Institute that doesn't strike back any (46:41 - 46:45)
memories to me they used latios and (46:42 - 46:47)
latias as the transition there I don't (46:45 - 46:48)
know if you guys have anything to say (46:47 - 46:50)
about that i mean i thought that i (46:48 - 46:53)
thought it was a fine segment i just i (46:50 - 46:54)
don't know where the weather Institute (46:53 - 46:58)
ranks on people's familiarity with Joe (46:54 - 47:00)
with Owen well but that was Howard's (46:58 - 47:02)
thing it was that it was the (47:00 - 47:03)
introduction introduction of weather (47:02 - 47:05)
conditions there you go cool yeah (47:03 - 47:08)
complete with my is my friend gave me a (47:05 - 47:13)
level 100 figure off not a lie so that (47:08 - 47:16)
makes complete sense now generation (47:13 - 47:17)
three introduced whether the weather (47:16 - 47:21)
Institute Institute we moved to Sinnoh (47:17 - 47:25)
at snow temple at snow point temple we (47:21 - 47:27)
see Picchu fighting everyone's favorite (47:25 - 47:30)
is a propo pass or is it nosepass think (47:27 - 47:32)
it was provo passed so let them like a (47:30 - 47:34)
bunch of the big mustache yeah yeah yeah (47:32 - 47:39)
ah we see Picchu fighting that and then (47:34 - 47:42)
we see a regigigas come up for the (47:39 - 47:45)
transition again I haven't played (47:42 - 47:49)
generation for since it came out ah I (47:45 - 47:51)
don't remember the importance of snow (47:49 - 47:53)
point temple well don't ask me because (47:51 - 47:57)
okay Travis anything a long time ago I (47:53 - 47:59)
remember the area I don't have a (47:57 - 48:01)
recollection of where it comes in the (47:59 - 48:03)
story or what generation serves but I (48:01 - 48:07)
remember the I remember the whole like (48:03 - 48:10)
snowy region at the North Asano and all (48:07 - 48:11)
that sort of thing though is Sinha the (48:10 - 48:15)
one with the volcano with the grass that (48:11 - 48:16)
you go through and you can pick up the (48:15 - 48:19)
ash is that sin oh that is Hoenn that is (48:16 - 48:25)
Hoenn huh okay sinnoh has um a mount (48:19 - 48:27)
core and a big mountain in the middle (48:25 - 48:29)
got it well it's no point is where you (48:27 - 48:32)
would encounter Reggie giggles so I (48:29 - 48:35)
there you go is is is that is that (48:32 - 48:39)
regigigas ha's temple is out I never got (48:35 - 48:41)
the reggies originally in the game I (48:39 - 48:42)
wasn't sure if you're supposed to get (48:41 - 48:44)
all three Reggie's go there you have to (48:42 - 48:47)
bring them okay so you do have to get (48:44 - 48:48)
yeah you do have to get the three (48:47 - 48:49)
Reggie's and then bring them to get (48:48 - 48:51)
regigigas right yeah (48:49 - 48:54)
okay see what we all solve this together (48:51 - 48:58)
ah regigigas transitions into you Nova (48:54 - 49:03)
we see Pikachu acting as Nathan Drake (48:58 - 49:04)
here struggling across this desert (49:03 - 49:08)
region I was this is my favorite part of (49:04 - 49:11)
the whole thing at like the fact that he (49:08 - 49:13)
had t got to the sandy part of the floor (49:11 - 49:15)
and fell through yeah it was how you (49:13 - 49:19)
navigated that the is it relic castles (49:15 - 49:22)
that would have the relic the relic (49:19 - 49:24)
temple I thought yeah that I love that (49:22 - 49:26)
throwback or that whenever call out to (49:24 - 49:29)
that yeah I think to me it reminds me of (49:26 - 49:31)
how frustrating that temple that that (49:29 - 49:34)
falling through the sand was it is real (49:31 - 49:37)
like castle oh is it okay we see the (49:34 - 49:38)
trainer in the background this is the (49:37 - 49:41)
first time the trainer appears since the (49:38 - 49:44)
Caterpie fight if i'm not mistaken and (49:41 - 49:46)
again the there's no focus on the (49:44 - 49:48)
trainer which I like a lot because I (49:46 - 49:51)
think it's supposed I'm strongly in (49:48 - 49:54)
favor of this trailer invoking your (49:51 - 49:56)
experiences with the game because I've (49:54 - 49:58)
given we're all saying like we remember (49:56 - 49:59)
this this is what we remember about this (49:58 - 50:01)
generation like for me falling through (49:59 - 50:02)
the hole in the temple and then going (50:01 - 50:04)
back up and then accidentally falling (50:02 - 50:06)
through it again kind of frustrating and (50:04 - 50:08)
so that's what this part of the the (50:06 - 50:11)
episode reminded me of Pikachu get (50:08 - 50:13)
sucked into the sand falls through and (50:11 - 50:16)
encounters of volcarona one of wills (50:13 - 50:19)
favorite Pokemon Europe I was so happy (50:16 - 50:22)
one of the coolest battle sequences here (50:19 - 50:25)
is when Pikachu slams onto the floor and (50:22 - 50:28)
uses it as a shield protecting itself (50:25 - 50:30)
from what I believe to be is a heat wave (50:28 - 50:33)
volt tackles volcarona into the slab and (50:30 - 50:36)
then we see a thunderous out of item (50:33 - 50:39)
we're now Thunder it is a landorus as (50:36 - 50:42)
the transition into terminus cave for (50:39 - 50:48)
the Kalos region and we see the mine (50:42 - 50:52)
cart and a noi fern chasing that I have (50:48 - 50:54)
all Pokemon noivern is the the (50:52 - 50:57)
generation 6 choice I guess that's okay (50:54 - 50:59)
it's (50:57 - 51:01)
of the pseudo legendary dragon dealy (50:59 - 51:03)
maybe sorry I sneezed in the lobby (51:01 - 51:06)
goodra um Adam you myself cuz I sneezed (51:03 - 51:08)
I like Noah and I think know everyone's (51:06 - 51:12)
a really cool pokemon yeah he's okay (51:08 - 51:15)
it's an Auvergne one of the few Pokemon (51:12 - 51:17)
that can learn boom burst well but also (51:15 - 51:19)
know everne is the one that you (51:17 - 51:21)
encounter in that series of caves around (51:19 - 51:25)
where zygarde is so I mean as much as I (51:21 - 51:27)
like Kalos I wouldn't say that the (51:25 - 51:30)
minecart area of Kalos was the part of (51:27 - 51:32)
the game that stood out to me well (51:30 - 51:34)
because you're not a completionist and (51:32 - 51:35)
you didn't have to walk all of those (51:34 - 51:37)
different paths and figure out that (51:35 - 51:38)
stupid maze to try to get to every (51:37 - 51:41)
different area in that tea I feel like (51:38 - 51:45)
the the part that really screams Kalos (51:41 - 51:51)
was the tower the wannabe Eiffel Tower (51:45 - 51:57)
but that's just me finally the NOI fern (51:51 - 51:59)
disappears and we transition to the (51:57 - 52:01)
trainer and Pikachu walking up to a (51:59 - 52:03)
giant crater in the ground we see (52:01 - 52:06)
zygarde complete form they're powering (52:03 - 52:09)
up pushing back Pikachu and then (52:06 - 52:11)
floating into the sky which then brings (52:09 - 52:15)
us to the generation title screen hard (52:11 - 52:16)
to tell what's region it was floating (52:15 - 52:20)
out of but presumably the lolla given (52:16 - 52:24)
that so i guard complete or one hundred (52:20 - 52:25)
percent or whatever it's called is in (52:24 - 52:29)
sun and moon and write x and y well i (52:25 - 52:32)
don't think so because the transition is (52:29 - 52:35)
the trainer and Pikachu get off of the (52:32 - 52:37)
mine cart and that's where zygarde (52:35 - 52:40)
complete is and then air into the air (52:37 - 52:42)
out of the ground yeah the clouds come (52:40 - 52:44)
in really fast but it there was no (52:42 - 52:47)
bodies of water around the area but (52:44 - 52:50)
again that's just thick I don't know (52:47 - 52:53)
what this the exact scale was for that (52:50 - 52:56)
um yeah I liked I liked the first (52:53 - 52:57)
trailer I like that I keep calling him (52:56 - 52:59)
trailers because they're so short I (52:57 - 53:02)
liked the first episode a lot I think (52:59 - 53:06)
that it really hit home on a lot of (53:02 - 53:08)
those generations in the fields (53:06 - 53:12)
especially for me canto joto do you guys (53:08 - 53:14)
have any other final thoughts on that or (53:12 - 53:16)
anything else you wanted to mention I (53:14 - 53:17)
feel like I talked a lot but I was just (53:16 - 53:19)
trying to break down the trailer I'm (53:17 - 53:22)
just very happy to have seen volcarona (53:19 - 53:25)
featured you to really like these things (53:22 - 53:30)
don't you yes oh no I think they're (53:25 - 53:33)
animated beautifully and they're done (53:30 - 53:36)
very well but i don't really like i (53:33 - 53:38)
guess and i might have talked about this (53:36 - 53:41)
on the show before but I'm not the type (53:38 - 53:43)
of Pokemon player that can name all of (53:41 - 53:45)
the gym leaders and basically any (53:43 - 53:47)
generation I'm not the type of person (53:45 - 53:50)
who I bet I bet you could do generation (53:47 - 53:55)
one and don't try me I'm not the type of (53:50 - 53:58)
person who gets immersed in the (53:55 - 54:00)
environments of the Pokemon world there (53:58 - 54:02)
are certain fictional worlds that I love (54:00 - 54:02)
and I (54:02 - 54:05)
love learning more about and exploring (54:02 - 54:09)
but Maya even though Pokemon is my (54:05 - 54:11)
favorite game series by a mile my (54:09 - 54:12)
enjoyment of it has never been very (54:11 - 54:17)
closely tied to locality or those sort (54:12 - 54:19)
of like spatial experiences or or even (54:17 - 54:22)
really the lure of the of the series (54:19 - 54:26)
it's not something that's grabbed me I (54:22 - 54:29)
when I have been grabbed by things about (54:26 - 54:32)
Pokemon other than character designs the (54:29 - 54:36)
Pokemon designs the the gameplay it's (54:32 - 54:39)
the game stories when they aren't (54:36 - 54:43)
interesting like generation 5 was not (54:39 - 54:45)
the sort of background information or (54:43 - 54:48)
the or the setting which kind of both of (54:45 - 54:51)
these shorts have been focused on sort (54:48 - 54:52)
of just adding to the lore of the (54:51 - 54:55)
universe so it's it's not really I think (54:52 - 54:56)
they're both pretty and they're both (54:55 - 54:59)
well done but but neither of them have a (54:56 - 55:01)
have a story to tell and that's kind of (54:59 - 55:03)
disappointing to me did you did you see (55:01 - 55:06)
the four episodes of pokemon origins (55:03 - 55:09)
Travis yeah and it what how would you (55:06 - 55:11)
compare that series to what you've seen (55:09 - 55:14)
so far of generations it's been quite a (55:11 - 55:17)
while but i liked origins and besides I (55:14 - 55:20)
like you you probably haven't seen an (55:17 - 55:22)
anime episode in a while yeah that's (55:20 - 55:24)
fair i mean i've caught a few here there (55:22 - 55:28)
i mean i've seen a few of the newest (55:24 - 55:30)
incarnation and i saw a few i mean (55:28 - 55:32)
pretty much every incarnation of the (55:30 - 55:35)
show I've seen an episode or two okay (55:32 - 55:37)
all right yeah I think I think that's an (55:35 - 55:41)
interesting dynamic where the lower the (55:37 - 55:43)
animation of the stories is something (55:41 - 55:46)
that Travis obviously just said that is (55:43 - 55:49)
not his draw whereas will and you can (55:46 - 55:50)
correct me if I'm wrong you definitely (55:49 - 55:53)
like the stories that are being told (55:50 - 55:55)
especially if you look at black and (55:53 - 55:56)
white black and white 2 which are the (55:55 - 55:59)
most story oriented games you really (55:56 - 56:02)
enjoyed that and I don't but I'm a big (55:59 - 56:05)
fan of the lower and why Pokemon exists (56:02 - 56:08)
in the world and relate to each other I (56:05 - 56:11)
just don't care for the (56:08 - 56:14)
4story in my Pokemon journey if that (56:11 - 56:16)
makes any sense I think it's interesting (56:14 - 56:19)
because both of us made a pretty strong (56:16 - 56:20)
distinction and I realized you were (56:19 - 56:22)
asking will a question here i am talking (56:20 - 56:25)
with i think it's interesting that we (56:22 - 56:26)
both made the clear distinction between (56:25 - 56:30)
lower and story in the in the pokemon (56:26 - 56:32)
games because i think there is a pretty (56:30 - 56:35)
clear one between the actual story of (56:32 - 56:38)
the game and then digging into the (56:35 - 56:40)
places and how they fit with each other (56:38 - 56:45)
i like the story meet me too and I don't (56:40 - 56:49)
really like the war although ask me (56:45 - 56:50)
about Elder Scrolls lore and I'll be (56:49 - 56:52)
sitting there for 20 minutes about Bowie (56:50 - 56:56)
Thea Prince of plots yeah and like I (56:52 - 56:59)
don't know how did for some people they (56:56 - 57:01)
might not know the difference between (56:59 - 57:05)
story and lower which is kind of hard to (57:01 - 57:07)
break down trying to think of like Duke (57:05 - 57:11)
clear-cut examples that would be very (57:07 - 57:13)
easy to point out (57:11 - 57:18)
I think story is Harry Potter diff a (57:13 - 57:20)
story is Harry Potter defeating the (57:18 - 57:24)
villains in each book the lore is (57:20 - 57:28)
knowing about like knowing the potion (57:24 - 57:31)
recipes knowing knowing the things that (57:28 - 57:33)
Harry learns in herbology class are (57:31 - 57:35)
knowing about all the beasts in the (57:33 - 57:38)
Harry Potter world story is the main (57:35 - 57:41)
narrative focus of a fiction than the (57:38 - 57:43)
lore is the background information that (57:41 - 57:45)
makes that story feel real because it's (57:43 - 57:47)
placed in a real world and that's (57:45 - 57:50)
especially true of fantasy fiction (57:47 - 57:53)
because it's the world sort of needs to (57:50 - 57:55)
prove itself as opposed to fiction (57:53 - 57:57)
that's more grounded in the real world (57:55 - 57:59)
typically doesn't have lore because it (57:57 - 58:00)
doesn't need to establish the world we (57:59 - 58:03)
already live in right I would I would (58:00 - 58:06)
say that we had we had this we have a (58:03 - 58:09)
debate in our slack community last week (58:06 - 58:11)
about some what about this and I don't (58:09 - 58:14)
know how I got started but my complaint (58:11 - 58:19)
with the story in in x and y is that the (58:14 - 58:23)
the story in x and y is a saving the (58:19 - 58:27)
world story it is that this cannon is (58:23 - 58:28)
going to go off and blow up the world (58:27 - 58:33)
and your job is to stop it and I didn't (58:28 - 58:36)
let I liked x and y a lot I hated that (58:33 - 58:39)
aspect of it when I started playing red (58:36 - 58:40)
and blue when I got into Pokemon it (58:39 - 58:43)
wasn't because I wanted to save the (58:40 - 58:44)
world it was because I wanted to be a (58:43 - 58:48)
pokemon trainer and I felt like red and (58:44 - 58:50)
blue and even gold and silver in a (58:48 - 58:52)
couple other games it felt like my (58:50 - 58:54)
journey of becoming a pokemon trainer (58:52 - 58:57)
and being quote unquote the best there (58:54 - 58:59)
ever was because when I beat the (58:57 - 59:01)
champion at the end I felt like I am the (58:59 - 59:04)
best pokemon trainer in this game I (59:01 - 59:06)
didn't sign up to save the world there (59:04 - 59:07)
are plenty of other games that do the (59:06 - 59:10)
save the world mechanic like every final (59:07 - 59:13)
fantasy or and final fantasy is a great (59:10 - 59:15)
example you buy a final fantasy you know (59:13 - 59:17)
what you're getting every time you're (59:15 - 59:19)
getting save the world story every (59:17 - 59:21)
single time you're giving a scene where (59:19 - 59:22)
the two main characters lean across a (59:21 - 59:26)
railing and do fake laughs for about 60 (59:22 - 59:26)
seconds (59:26 - 59:29)
haha so when I buy a pokemon game I want (59:26 - 59:31)
that experience I want the experience of (59:29 - 59:34)
I signed up to be the best pokemon (59:31 - 59:37)
trainer and I didn't sign up for a save (59:34 - 59:40)
the world story not my problem with x (59:37 - 59:45)
and y was that the story leaned into the (59:40 - 59:48)
lore in a way I didn't like the story (59:45 - 59:50)
was saying that the only reason this (59:48 - 59:53)
cannon works is because we need an exert (59:50 - 59:56)
yes or we need a eva tile to power the (59:53 - 59:58)
cabin I didn't play both so i'm i'm (59:56 - 60:00)
pretty sure they just flip the two (59:58 - 60:03)
Pokemon and I didn't like that because I (60:00 - 60:06)
feel like most legendary Pokemon don't (60:03 - 60:09)
need story to make their lower (60:06 - 60:12)
interesting like Mewtwo isn't mentioned (60:09 - 60:15)
really at all in the first game besides (60:12 - 60:18)
subtle hansen like the diary that you (60:15 - 60:23)
find on the the island or in this in the (60:18 - 60:26)
the self tower (60:23 - 60:28)
but when you discover Mewtwo and when (60:26 - 60:30)
you find me too and whether you catch it (60:28 - 60:31)
or not because you wasted your master (60:30 - 60:34)
bar earlier Mewtwo still has a lot of (60:31 - 60:38)
lore where when you think of Eva telling (60:34 - 60:40)
xerneas it's hard to think about them (60:38 - 60:43)
without going well they were used in a (60:40 - 60:46)
tool for the cannon which was part of (60:43 - 60:49)
the story which just leaves a bad taste (60:46 - 60:51)
in my mouth (60:49 - 60:53)
oh come on what you're talking about so (60:51 - 60:59)
I know I I I get it I you know I I can (60:53 - 61:04)
understand that having a Pokemon that's (60:59 - 61:10)
supposed to be this way quite literally (61:04 - 61:14)
legendary creature that represents (61:10 - 61:16)
either life or death depending on which (61:14 - 61:19)
one we're talking about so firmly (61:16 - 61:22)
connected to this particular crisis plot (61:19 - 61:27)
seems to my devalue its status as the (61:22 - 61:30)
sarnia says the bringer of life if it if (61:27 - 61:34)
you're only connection with it if it has (61:30 - 61:36)
a connection to the story that is only (61:34 - 61:39)
solving the plot that it's sort of (61:36 - 61:41)
cheapens that i don't really feel that (61:39 - 61:43)
effect because i feel like the Pokemon (61:41 - 61:45)
games do enough to show that these (61:43 - 61:48)
Pokemon have sort of other (61:45 - 61:51)
responsibilities or that they are the (61:48 - 61:53)
their relationship to you even if you (61:51 - 61:55)
catch them is like they've been doing a (61:53 - 61:57)
lot of stuff before you caught them (61:55 - 61:59)
especially with like Jenna for with (61:57 - 62:03)
Arceus creating all of the the lake (61:59 - 62:07)
spirits and dialga and palkia and (62:03 - 62:10)
Garrett Tina um but to your another (62:07 - 62:12)
point (62:10 - 62:15)
Pokemon has the same narrative (62:12 - 62:17)
confines that a lot of sequels tend to (62:15 - 62:18)
have are a lot of series with multiple (62:17 - 62:22)
sequels where you are always expected to (62:18 - 62:25)
be at least as the climax is always (62:22 - 62:28)
expected to be at least as threatening (62:25 - 62:32)
as the previous entry in the series if (62:28 - 62:35)
not more so they got to keep upping the (62:32 - 62:37)
ante right and you can only and it just (62:35 - 62:41)
becomes sort of a you you can only go so (62:37 - 62:44)
far as saving the world all right that (62:41 - 62:46)
you sort of get to the logical (62:44 - 62:47)
conclusion of saving the world than (62:46 - 62:49)
every entry and and Pokemon already (62:47 - 62:52)
basically got there in gen 3 but I feel (62:49 - 62:54)
like gin for didn't have it save the (62:52 - 62:59)
world yeah i mean you're talking about a (62:54 - 62:59)
villainous team that's trying to like (62:59 - 63:04)
reset the creation of the universe or (63:02 - 63:06)
whatever team galactic was trying to do (63:04 - 63:09)
with the yoga and palkia which I win cuz (63:06 - 63:12)
I'm sad that you remembered that finally (63:09 - 63:13)
that they wanted to create a new (63:12 - 63:17)
universe yes but I mean that was not (63:13 - 63:19)
saving the world great you're using (63:17 - 63:20)
through the own universe go there have (63:19 - 63:23)
fun Ops will be here training mukilteo (63:20 - 63:25)
and I would can I would consider that a (63:23 - 63:28)
similarly existential threat personally (63:25 - 63:33)
while while i do get that the it does (63:28 - 63:34)
send me that that sequels tend to have (63:33 - 63:37)
that narrative restriction not really (63:34 - 63:39)
restriction because they can do whatever (63:37 - 63:41)
they want but expectation is probably a (63:39 - 63:44)
better word on because i would like each (63:41 - 63:47)
entry to sort of speak for itself um i (63:44 - 63:51)
don't get too disappointed with it as (63:47 - 63:53)
long as what they do with saving the (63:51 - 63:54)
world is interesting and I think (63:53 - 63:56)
generations five and six have both had (63:54 - 64:00)
interesting stories um and I guess (63:56 - 64:02)
generation if I wasn't really about (64:00 - 64:03)
saving the world but it was about saving (64:02 - 64:07)
the the current World Order of the (64:03 - 64:09)
relationship between trainers in Pokemon (64:07 - 64:13)
and I guess that team plasma wanted to (64:09 - 64:14)
take over the world not necessarily (64:13 - 64:17)
destroy it but I'm getting off on a (64:14 - 64:20)
tangent I think it just de values your (64:17 - 64:23)
your legendary Pokemon to put them in a (64:20 - 64:27)
situation where you have to catch them (64:23 - 64:29)
like in black and white you could (64:27 - 64:32)
not catch Zekrom arrest ram and so (64:29 - 64:35)
you're you're giving everyone a (64:32 - 64:37)
legendary pokemon for free ultimately (64:35 - 64:40)
and you're not giving them the (64:37 - 64:44)
opportunity or the challenge to get what (64:40 - 64:46)
is considered (64:44 - 64:49)
the top tier pokemon like getting to mu2 (64:46 - 64:51)
or finding Articuno or going out of your (64:49 - 64:55)
way to find Zapdos or Agra small trace (64:51 - 64:57)
kind of existed known really when other (64:55 - 65:01)
way for that but those pokemon all felt (64:57 - 65:04)
exciting captured they didn't feel like (65:01 - 65:06)
they were just randomly placed like the (65:04 - 65:10)
journey to get to them I think at least (65:06 - 65:13)
to me was was extremely memorable I i (65:10 - 65:15)
can see that point but i think i can see (65:13 - 65:17)
that the mystique gets a little broken (65:15 - 65:20)
when it is a scripted element of the (65:17 - 65:22)
plot that you catch these pokemon but i (65:20 - 65:24)
feel like that same mystique is broken (65:22 - 65:27)
in all of those cases when then a battle (65:24 - 65:29)
later you're instructing you to to use (65:27 - 65:33)
psychic like it if this book Mon truly (65:29 - 65:37)
is this high and mighty world (65:33 - 65:39)
controlling Beast then why does it (65:37 - 65:42)
listen to you because of Randall own i (65:39 - 65:44)
guess that's and I guess that's why the (65:42 - 65:46)
Laura that Pokemon games have always not (65:44 - 65:48)
really taken me because there's so many (65:46 - 65:50)
inconsistencies so many strange things (65:48 - 65:52)
about how they interact with the (65:50 - 65:53)
mechanics of the game that it doesn't (65:52 - 65:56)
feel like it's even trying it feels like (65:53 - 65:58)
half of the time it's trying to be a (65:56 - 66:00)
real world and then half of the time (65:58 - 66:03)
it's trying to be like tongue in cheek (66:00 - 66:06)
it's like yeah I'll start that it stuns (66:03 - 66:08)
again part of the time is trying to be a (66:06 - 66:10)
real world that you believe in and I can (66:08 - 66:12)
respect that if you want to do that then (66:10 - 66:15)
do it well then don't go and bend the (66:12 - 66:17)
rules of your world just because the (66:15 - 66:19)
mechanics dictate it and don't bend the (66:17 - 66:20)
rules of the world just to like make a (66:19 - 66:23)
meanie joke as a reference to the real (66:20 - 66:25)
world which that bothers me in the (66:23 - 66:27)
Pokemon series because it it's not (66:25 - 66:29)
consistent with what they're trying to (66:27 - 66:31)
do that there's too many breaches and in (66:29 - 66:33)
the world building for it for me to (66:31 - 66:36)
really care about it and I think chief (66:33 - 66:38)
among those are the very mechanics of (66:36 - 66:41)
the game that I love like I am not (66:38 - 66:44)
really going to buy that these places (66:41 - 66:47)
are real places if you know these (66:44 - 66:50)
Pokemon that they talk about as gods are (66:47 - 66:53)
just like in my pocket currently yeah I (66:50 - 66:55)
it doesn't feel real that was my other (66:53 - 66:59)
complaint with the the X&Y story was (66:55 - 67:01)
we have this powerful Pokemon powering (66:59 - 67:02)
this cannon that can destroy the world (67:01 - 67:04)
when it's already been established in (67:02 - 67:07)
the lore that a pokemon like Mewtwo or a (67:04 - 67:10)
pokemon like d-axis could easily do that (67:07 - 67:13)
on their own because they are that (67:10 - 67:16)
strong really that strong do you think (67:13 - 67:18)
the axis could destroy the world yes (67:16 - 67:21)
I think I think enough Pokemon could (67:18 - 67:23)
stop deoxys from destroying the world (67:21 - 67:25)
but it is clearly proven in the (67:23 - 67:28)
generation six story that a 10 year old (67:25 - 67:30)
trainer could stop a giant cannon d axis (67:28 - 67:33)
is not that strong not even half of its (67:30 - 67:38)
forms or even meta totally so I will (67:33 - 67:41)
take this back one step to ultra beasts (67:38 - 67:45)
and the island challenges and all of (67:41 - 67:47)
that biz I think that in doing that the (67:45 - 67:49)
pokemon company or Game Freak is trying (67:47 - 67:51)
to restore some of the mystique to the (67:49 - 67:54)
games because once again we're entering (67:51 - 67:56)
into a game and we don't know what to (67:54 - 67:59)
expect right there's no more expectation (67:56 - 68:01)
of legendary trios I think that's going (67:59 - 68:04)
out the window so you're not going into (68:01 - 68:07)
the game looking for the predefined ok (68:04 - 68:09)
what is the legendary trio for this one (68:07 - 68:11)
which is the equivalent of the legendary (68:09 - 68:15)
birds and all that kind of stuff so it's (68:11 - 68:16)
a it's a whole new world that we're (68:15 - 68:18)
going into and hopefully we will be as (68:16 - 68:21)
delighted as we were for red and blue (68:18 - 68:23)
yeah maybe I'm just worried that these (68:21 - 68:26)
ultra beasts are purposely based off of (68:23 - 68:28)
the characters we've seen and that (68:26 - 68:33)
that's weird i don't know like the only (68:28 - 68:35)
other comparison is Mewtwo is kind of (68:33 - 68:37)
related to Giovanni but not really (68:35 - 68:40)
anything like cousins like you can take (68:37 - 68:42)
or leave that like like in the very (68:40 - 68:45)
first movie how with Giovanni (68:42 - 68:48)
tried to control Mewtwo with the (68:45 - 68:50)
equipment and the reason that Mewtwo is (68:48 - 68:52)
in cerulean cave is because it ran away (68:50 - 68:54)
and that's where it ended up going and (68:52 - 68:58)
like Giovanni was the one that paid to (68:54 - 68:59)
have me to create it if I'm not mistaken (68:58 - 69:02)
he was the one that paid the scientist (68:59 - 69:06)
ryan movie definitely yes yeah i think (69:02 - 69:09)
that is also in the game I don't know (69:06 - 69:12)
that's all right I can't can't I think (69:09 - 69:13)
it's also in the game because I feel (69:12 - 69:15)
like Sony's don't ask me something about (69:13 - 69:17)
the moon dis give me the Elder Scrolls (69:15 - 69:20)
that I can get you enhancer let's talk (69:17 - 69:22)
about the second trailer in this title (69:20 - 69:24)
the chase it has two points it's an (69:22 - 69:26)
episode not a trail yeah I get nice and (69:24 - 69:28)
short the second short I keep saying (69:26 - 69:32)
trailer I feel like it's leading up to a (69:28 - 69:36)
bigger story it has 2.2 million views (69:32 - 69:38)
which doesn't make any sense how does it (69:36 - 69:43)
have 1.3 million less when these came (69:38 - 69:46)
out on the same day I don't understand (69:43 - 69:48)
maybe people saw episode 1 and thought I (69:46 - 69:50)
don't want any more of this yeah maybe (69:48 - 69:52)
also episode 2 was uploaded before (69:50 - 69:53)
episode 1 (69:52 - 69:56)
by like 10 seconds why would you watch (69:54 - 69:58)
episode 2 first if you saw the title (69:56 - 70:02)
episode 2 that's maybe I the description (69:58 - 70:04)
is detective looker of the international (70:02 - 70:06)
police uncovers critical information in (70:04 - 70:08)
the hunt for Team Rocket boss Giovanni (70:06 - 70:13)
ah walk through this again I don't think (70:08 - 70:16)
really much happens it starts with (70:13 - 70:20)
looker and some mustache police officer (70:16 - 70:23)
with no name I talking about getting (70:20 - 70:26)
Giovanni and breaking down the game (70:23 - 70:30)
corner yeah game corner obviously Team (70:26 - 70:34)
Rocket's hideout in in red and blue ah (70:30 - 70:36)
they don't make it clearer why they (70:34 - 70:39)
break down the game corner besides to (70:36 - 70:40)
get cos knock their business their base (70:39 - 70:43)
of operation bring them when they freed (70:40 - 70:45)
the Pokemon that we're being held there (70:43 - 70:47)
against their will but let me gamble (70:45 - 70:51)
don't kick me out there are see there's (70:47 - 70:55)
no sense at all there (70:51 - 70:55)
unsure where Giovanni is this is the (70:55 - 71:00)
first literal minute of the episode is (70:58 - 71:03)
talking about they broke down the game (71:00 - 71:04)
corner they still can't find Giovanni (71:03 - 71:10)
they do the weakest plot point of (71:04 - 71:12)
Giovanni's men will not tell us where (71:10 - 71:14)
Giovanni is they are extremely loyal (71:12 - 71:18)
let's move on it's just four minutes of (71:14 - 71:21)
looker talking to people who look like (71:18 - 71:26)
SWAT team people and then walking into (71:21 - 71:28)
an empty room touching an explosion and (71:26 - 71:31)
then you see Giovanni for a like a hot (71:28 - 71:33)
second and then it's over yeah actually (71:31 - 71:37)
on explosion well there the debris from (71:33 - 71:39)
an explosion I'm sorry so hey it's I've (71:37 - 71:42)
been recording this for already almost (71:39 - 71:43)
an hour and a half i'm sorry i didn't (71:42 - 71:46)
get every word perfect for you will so (71:43 - 71:47)
we went from we don't know where (71:46 - 71:50)
Giovanni is do we broke down the game (71:47 - 71:53)
corner to we're interrogating Giovanni's (71:50 - 71:56)
men they're super loyal they won't tell (71:53 - 71:58)
us where Giovanni is to all of a sudden (71:56 - 72:00)
we know Giovanni is now the gym leader (71:58 - 72:03)
yeah there's just some dude who says (72:00 - 72:07)
he's been spotted in the Viridian gym (72:03 - 72:10)
like the first he's like at a computer (72:07 - 72:12)
and he like turns around like I just got (72:10 - 72:16)
an electronic mail this is the word i (72:12 - 72:19)
got an AOL instant message indicating (72:16 - 72:22)
that Giovanni's in fact in the range in (72:19 - 72:25)
which is still worth minute and 20 (72:22 - 72:29)
seconds ever oh how did we get here they (72:25 - 72:30)
put a bunch of spotlights on Veridian (72:29 - 72:34)
gym and they bring out a SWAT team and (72:30 - 72:37)
they there they state that Giovanni is a (72:34 - 72:42)
powerful pokemon trainer so we need (72:37 - 72:46)
50-plus riot gear security guards to (72:42 - 72:50)
come here um to break into his gym full (72:46 - 72:56)
SWAT team I this doesn't work like (72:50 - 73:00)
bringing the SWAT team is ridiculous I (72:56 - 73:03)
guess what it all it shows I feel like (73:00 - 73:05)
what they're trying to convey is (73:03 - 73:08)
Giovanni is extremely powerful and (73:05 - 73:11)
that's why we need this many men but at (73:08 - 73:14)
the same time it references that two (73:11 - 73:17)
people have beaten Giovanni up to this (73:14 - 73:20)
point red and blue ash and Gary whatever (73:17 - 73:22)
you want to call it those are the two (73:20 - 73:25)
people all right I promise you anytime (73:22 - 73:27)
you're making a raid on a mob bosses (73:25 - 73:29)
location it's gonna be a lot of SWAT (73:27 - 73:32)
police officers involved I think it's (73:29 - 73:33)
cool that they have an Arcanine they (73:32 - 73:36)
have a machamp that are you know ready (73:33 - 73:38)
to swat it up with the SWAT team the (73:36 - 73:40)
best thing about either of these shorts (73:38 - 73:43)
is the part where i'm a champ full-on (73:40 - 73:49)
cool a man's through so they spread out (73:43 - 73:51)
into three groups we know in the pokemon (73:49 - 73:53)
lore (73:51 - 73:58)
that the gym leaders are pretty much the (73:53 - 74:01)
people in charge of the town (73:58 - 74:02)
that's at least how its kind of broken (74:01 - 74:04)
down in the hierarchy of the Pokemon (74:02 - 74:09)
world I don't understand how looker who (74:04 - 74:11)
is a detective is the worst detective in (74:09 - 74:14)
the entire world to not know that (74:11 - 74:19)
Giovanni is a gym leader and whether or (74:14 - 74:24)
not it's kept secret how at this point (74:19 - 74:28)
has he been a gym leader so long that he (74:24 - 74:31)
has recently or only given out two (74:28 - 74:34)
badges I find it hard to believe that (74:31 - 74:37)
the Elite Four has existed as long as (74:34 - 74:39)
they have and the only way to get the (74:37 - 74:42)
Elite Four is they have eight badges and (74:39 - 74:45)
recently two people have beaten Giovanni (74:42 - 74:48)
and that's how we suddenly know the (74:45 - 74:50)
history of the Viridian gym clearly has (74:48 - 74:53)
been a mystery up to this point i will (74:50 - 74:57)
give you some small i will call them (74:53 - 75:00)
apologies because yes the program was (74:57 - 75:03)
not perfect but one thing that looker (75:00 - 75:06)
does comment on arriving at the Viridian (75:03 - 75:08)
gym is the Viridian Jim was supposed to (75:06 - 75:13)
be closed so potentially potentially (75:08 - 75:17)
Giovanni went in and wasn't really (75:13 - 75:19)
supposed to be the gym leader or he had (75:17 - 75:21)
basically been neglecting his duties for (75:19 - 75:23)
a long time and only appeared there as a (75:21 - 75:27)
response to his initial encounter with (75:23 - 75:30)
red and now wanted to challenge this (75:27 - 75:32)
up-and-coming pokemon trainer which had (75:30 - 75:34)
who had impressed him so much with his (75:32 - 75:37)
Pokemon training capabilities she will (75:34 - 75:40)
offer him a badge but Steve is kind of (75:37 - 75:43)
right just in terms of how it comes off (75:40 - 75:46)
though because the it's not like because (75:43 - 75:49)
you do get the one line from luckier (75:46 - 75:50)
that establishes like this place was (75:49 - 75:52)
supposed to be closed but it almost (75:50 - 75:54)
seems like he's saying like I didn't (75:52 - 75:57)
know this place was open not it how you (75:54 - 75:59)
know like not no one knew this place was (75:57 - 76:02)
open it's like (75:59 - 76:04)
so I think Steve is I think you're both (76:02 - 76:07)
right in the sense that they do include (76:04 - 76:09)
that line to give you the context but (76:07 - 76:13)
but I I'm with Steve and that it does (76:09 - 76:16)
kind of feel like you know someone is (76:13 - 76:18)
like mr. president it turns according to (76:16 - 76:21)
these records el chapo has been (76:18 - 76:23)
president of Juarez route has been mayor (76:21 - 76:29)
of Juarez for the past 40 years oh like (76:23 - 76:34)
I get it doesn't like it the like the (76:29 - 76:36)
way the rest of the series sets up gym (76:34 - 76:38)
leaders and Jim's is that their this (76:36 - 76:40)
institution that's perpetually around (76:38 - 76:42)
like like how did people even go to the (76:40 - 76:45)
kantou elite four if the viridian gems (76:42 - 76:46)
are spent like there's no discussion of (76:45 - 76:49)
that like it that none of the details (76:46 - 76:51)
like really fit when you think right (76:49 - 76:54)
much about them anywhere on a break it's (76:51 - 76:56)
okay even if Giovanni standing there (76:54 - 76:58)
when you get there even if Giovanni (76:56 - 77:02)
closed the gym clearly he was a gym (76:58 - 77:05)
leader prior to the gym closing like you (77:02 - 77:06)
just don't become a gym leader instantly (77:05 - 77:09)
close it and then prevent everyone from (77:06 - 77:10)
getting to the Elite Four like other (77:09 - 77:12)
people have gotten to the Elite Four (77:10 - 77:15)
before you that's a dark story that (77:12 - 77:17)
remains to be told how the once (77:15 - 77:20)
good-hearted and Noble Giovanni was (77:17 - 77:24)
turned to darkness this is a raid I (77:20 - 77:27)
understand the raid aspect of things (77:24 - 77:30)
this is a public building I believe I (77:27 - 77:32)
feel like gyms are public buildings like (77:30 - 77:36)
libraries are courthouses little IMCA (77:32 - 77:39)
let's just melt the wall with an (77:36 - 77:42)
Arcanine and then let's also kool-aid (77:39 - 77:45)
man through the other wall but gosh (77:42 - 77:49)
forbid we don't damage the front door we (77:45 - 77:51)
just break the locking kick it open and (77:49 - 77:54)
looker the only one without body armor a (77:51 - 77:58)
riot shield is the first to go in which (77:54 - 78:01)
I can't boggles my mind it's just silly (77:58 - 78:05)
well that trench coat he wears is made (78:01 - 78:07)
from nibble nibble snarf skin so i will (78:05 - 78:12)
say those immune to bombs the ah the (78:07 - 78:15)
hack on might really cool nice little (78:12 - 78:18)
some a feature know what Magnemite (78:15 - 78:20)
hacking it (78:18 - 78:23)
how come okay it didn't hack anything (78:20 - 78:25)
it's like it's a little bit just right (78:23 - 78:28)
yeah overcharged is fried fried the the (78:25 - 78:31)
the the glass doors that didn't get (78:28 - 78:35)
damaged but good old Machamp smile at (78:31 - 78:38)
through a wall and good luck good-o (78:35 - 78:42)
arcanine just melting and let's go back (78:38 - 78:45)
to the we need a cannon to destroy the (78:42 - 78:50)
entire world our k9 melted pure concrete (78:45 - 78:53)
with a flamethrower yeah but then he was (78:50 - 78:55)
real tired after that Z I don't know (78:53 - 78:58)
talk about a real strong that's all I'm (78:55 - 79:01)
saying I mean how many PP tis (78:58 - 79:04)
flamethrower have he melted the concrete (79:01 - 79:06)
to the point where the concrete was (79:04 - 79:10)
dripping molten lava in defense of (79:06 - 79:12)
pokémons continuity on that specific (79:10 - 79:15)
aspect I would say that the Pokemon (79:12 - 79:16)
world does seem like some sort of (79:15 - 79:19)
strange post-scarcity utopia where (79:16 - 79:23)
healthcare is is free no one is poor (79:19 - 79:27)
thank you like Pokemon do all of the (79:23 - 79:30)
work so healthcare is free no one is (79:27 - 79:32)
poor and law enforcement of dubious (79:30 - 79:37)
quality so looker with a growlithe (79:32 - 79:40)
behind him unclear if that is indeed his (79:37 - 79:44)
pokemon or not encounters the gym arena (79:40 - 79:47)
of giovanni discovers giovanni's not (79:44 - 79:49)
there there is like some black goop on (79:47 - 79:51)
the ground and they call that an (79:49 - 79:54)
explosion I'm not I'm unclear to be like (79:51 - 79:57)
it's supposed to be like the charred (79:54 - 80:00)
floor from an explosion of like a (79:57 - 80:04)
pokemon trainer battle or yeah yeah that (80:00 - 80:07)
bring okay I mean that brings up the (80:04 - 80:10)
questions of do we replace the floor (80:07 - 80:13)
every time there's pokemon battle it (80:10 - 80:14)
just makes it unclear of how these (80:13 - 80:16)
arenas are so scarcity economy they can (80:14 - 80:20)
afford it this is how everyone stays in (80:16 - 80:22)
business battles break down people have (80:20 - 80:23)
worked because they need to replace the (80:22 - 80:26)
floor Machamp comes running through the (80:23 - 80:27)
door with a big ol smile on his face (80:26 - 80:29)
because he's happy he kool aid man (80:27 - 80:32)
through a wall um I don't think the (80:29 - 80:33)
floor was ruined I think there was (80:32 - 80:38)
like God remains you know of the battle (80:33 - 80:40)
over she just need somebody to like (80:38 - 80:42)
sleep all right the janitor the janitor (80:40 - 80:45)
gets in business we go to this we go to (80:42 - 80:48)
this pan out to Giovanni looking back at (80:45 - 80:51)
viridian city saying that you know Team (80:48 - 80:53)
Rocket will never be defeated Team (80:51 - 80:57)
Rocket will never fall we get a close up (80:53 - 81:00)
on his evil eyes he puts a fedora on and (80:57 - 81:03)
then he walks away proof that he is evil (81:00 - 81:08)
it it's just the overall I get it they (81:03 - 81:11)
have three to five minutes I don't (81:08 - 81:14)
really understand what that episode is (81:11 - 81:16)
trying to accomplish well it answers the (81:14 - 81:20)
question of like you continue playing (81:16 - 81:23)
pokemon red or blue but Giovanni never (81:20 - 81:26)
gets caught so it kind of like fills in (81:23 - 81:28)
why it wasn't Giovanni club because he (81:26 - 81:31)
got away so there you go well now that (81:28 - 81:34)
questions answered that mystery has been (81:31 - 81:38)
solved I mean if anything it makes it (81:34 - 81:41)
just makes Giovanni look strong (81:38 - 81:44)
everybody is strong no I and I like that (81:41 - 81:47)
I if there's any characters in the (81:44 - 81:50)
Pokemon universe that I want to know (81:47 - 81:53)
more about it is the gym leaders and the (81:50 - 81:56)
bike shop people what's their deal why (81:53 - 81:58)
do they put these exorbitant prices on (81:56 - 82:00)
things if they're just gonna give them (81:58 - 82:04)
away what is going on there yeah I mean (82:00 - 82:08)
it makes Giovanni look good if your look (82:04 - 82:10)
or was first introduced in generation (82:08 - 82:12)
five if i'm not mistaken oh you are (82:10 - 82:14)
mistaken flee engine for it is sling (82:12 - 82:17)
platinum he's at least in platinum if (82:14 - 82:20)
not Jennifer generally yeah he's (82:17 - 82:22)
definitely before ngentot you think (82:20 - 82:24)
platinum though but now base series done (82:22 - 82:26)
for all I'll look up if it's I think (82:24 - 82:28)
you're right I think I think I think he (82:26 - 82:29)
might be just in diamond and pearl (82:28 - 82:31)
briefly and then expanded upon in (82:29 - 82:34)
platinum but I look at well what does (82:31 - 82:36)
what does looker do in the games break (82:34 - 82:39)
it down for me well he's just moves the (82:36 - 82:43)
plot along he is an investigator for an (82:39 - 82:47)
international policing organization so (82:43 - 82:50)
people like he asks you as a strong (82:47 - 82:52)
trainer to help him in his (82:50 - 82:55)
investigations so he's based busy he is (82:52 - 82:57)
the postgame in black and white (82:55 - 83:00)
definitely yeah that's the last one I (82:57 - 83:01)
heard about him the most was post game (83:00 - 83:03)
black and white turns out he's not in (83:01 - 83:05)
the base games of diamond and pearl he's (83:03 - 83:07)
introduced in pokemon platinum is there (83:05 - 83:10)
anything specific he's notable in (83:07 - 83:12)
platinum for oh he's he's like (83:10 - 83:17)
investigating team galactic okay based (83:12 - 83:19)
on his investigations in this three to (83:17 - 83:21)
five minutes I'm still going with the (83:19 - 83:23)
the the thought that he is one of the (83:21 - 83:26)
worst detectives ever he does act as a (83:23 - 83:28)
bit of a comic relief character and a (83:26 - 83:30)
lot of instances alright well let's take (83:28 - 83:34)

the pokemon gold plus is out now it is (86:18 - 86:24)
available it is probably extremely hard (86:23 - 86:27)
to find I did order one on amazon my (86:24 - 86:30)
amazon delivery date is this wednesday (86:27 - 86:31)
so i should be getting it this week and (86:30 - 86:35)
I do plan on doing a review of it and (86:31 - 86:37)
taking it out and making it work so I've (86:35 - 86:39)
done some Pokemon reviews up to this (86:37 - 86:41)
point if you go over to our YouTube page (86:39 - 86:44)
youtube com such pkmn cast and you can (86:41 - 86:46)
see some of those but I'll give next (86:44 - 86:48)
week we'll talk more about the Pokemon (86:46 - 86:51)
go plus the other bit of news I forgot (86:48 - 86:55)
is that the kora kora besides revealing (86:51 - 86:56)
new ultra bees they also revealed Rock (86:55 - 86:59)
ruffs evolution and it looks like rock (86:56 - 87:01)
rough will evolve into a Pokemon called (86:59 - 87:07)
lugar en lugar egan gurren lagann ha (87:01 - 87:10)
Golu Gringer gun wait what are we (87:07 - 87:14)
talking about aa giant robot anime (87:10 - 87:18)
obviously wait we're not talking we're (87:14 - 87:20)
not i would get zoned out cuz it wasn't (87:18 - 87:23)
important to me we're not why didn't we (87:20 - 87:24)
start talking about gurren lagann (87:23 - 87:27)
because rock roughs evolution is called (87:24 - 87:32)
like loup-garou gan something okay now (87:27 - 87:34)
now we're all on the same planet got it (87:32 - 87:37)
I its appearance will change whether it (87:34 - 87:39)
during the day or whether it involves at (87:37 - 87:42)
night this is they're not too different (87:39 - 87:45)
pokemon I think of this more as meowstic (87:42 - 87:47)
the male and female meowstic are the (87:45 - 87:49)
same they just look different and this (87:47 - 87:51)
is going to be the case for rock refs (87:49 - 87:54)
evolution the name I can't say it says (87:51 - 87:58)
that this article this is actually from (87:54 - 88:00)
Nintendo life because they they stole (87:58 - 88:02)
the not stole but they took the images (88:00 - 88:05)
off therapy and savvy and therapy got (88:02 - 88:09)
them from Cora Cora but they say a safe (88:05 - 88:13)
bet that they will have differences in (88:09 - 88:17)
combat the magazine has skis at these (88:13 - 88:19)
that it would reveal a secret about rock (88:17 - 88:21)
rough that is GERD along with the ax (88:19 - 88:24)
Lolan region starters while this could (88:21 - 88:27)
be a secret rowlett Lytton and populo (88:24 - 88:29)
could also have (88:27 - 88:31)
separate forms based on time of (88:29 - 88:35)
evolution this interesting this is still (88:31 - 88:39)
unsure v i'm going to say the Sun (88:35 - 88:42)
evolution because it has a lot of orange (88:39 - 88:47)
around it a lot of yellow around it is (88:42 - 88:50)
they let their werewolves so if you (88:47 - 88:53)
listen to my packs episode I found some (88:50 - 88:57)
wikipedia articles and I based rock (88:53 - 88:58)
rough off a certain type of dog that is (88:57 - 89:01)
known to get rabies very easily it's (88:58 - 89:04)
also one of the dogs that are very (89:01 - 89:08)
similar to have werewolf or wolf like (89:04 - 89:12)
characteristics but yes these uh I would (89:08 - 89:14)
say that the Sun evolution is quote (89:12 - 89:17)
unquote more of a wolf and the moon (89:14 - 89:19)
evolution which if you look at the scans (89:17 - 89:21)
it has a lot of blue around it a lot of (89:19 - 89:22)
darker colors which makes me think that (89:21 - 89:25)
this is obviously the night evolution is (89:22 - 89:27)
more of a werewolf looking Pokemon they (89:25 - 89:30)
look very different a lot like the (89:27 - 89:33)
meowstic line where male and female look (89:30 - 89:35)
pretty different but not much else is (89:33 - 89:39)
said about those so it is looga Rugen (89:35 - 89:41)
loup-garou gan i'm assuming it's (89:39 - 89:44)
something off likin that i think (89:41 - 89:46)
something yeah along those lines I (89:44 - 89:51)
midday form the Sun form learns a move (89:46 - 89:54)
called excel rock which is a new move (89:51 - 89:57)
and the midnight form learns a move (89:54 - 90:00)
called counter so they will have (89:57 - 90:01)
different moves depending on which (90:00 - 90:04)
evolution you have and correct me if I'm (90:01 - 90:06)
wrong Travis but the meowstic lines have (90:04 - 90:07)
different moves whether it's male or (90:06 - 90:09)
female that is correct they have (90:07 - 90:11)
different completely different move sets (90:09 - 90:14)
yep there we go for those who like (90:11 - 90:17)
wolves or werewolves your Pokemon are (90:14 - 90:18)
now here (90:17 - 90:21)
I'm and I I would safely as I would bet (90:18 - 90:26)
that the the the day for ms ground (90:21 - 90:30)
something but the the night for my feel (90:26 - 90:33)
like is dark round or ground dark wasn't (90:30 - 90:35)
rock rough rock type yeah sorry but (90:33 - 90:38)
there's lots rock typing rock I don't (90:35 - 90:40)
know I thought ground these rocks are (90:38 - 90:42)
ours it's called ground rough ground (90:40 - 90:46)
rough good old ground rough okay let's (90:42 - 90:50)
move into our pokemon of the week I'm (90:46 - 90:52)
gonna throw it right to Travis again we (90:50 - 90:57)
can mix it up this time I guess cuz (90:52 - 91:00)
there was a Vigoroth in the generation (90:57 - 91:03)
short we're doing slacking slaking how (91:00 - 91:05)
we're going to pronounce it I feel like (91:03 - 91:06)
we've done this before but that's (91:05 - 91:10)
alright slaking is such good stats it (91:06 - 91:13)
must be amazing well there's one large (91:10 - 91:16)
problem and that's its ability truant (91:13 - 91:19)
truant is an ability that only slacking (91:16 - 91:22)
possesses where your second fourth (91:19 - 91:26)
cetera turns having slacking out it will (91:22 - 91:28)
instead of doing the move you instruct (91:26 - 91:31)
it to use do nothing as it is loafing (91:28 - 91:36)
around so every other move you make will (91:31 - 91:40)
not actually do anything so even though (91:36 - 91:42)
it has great stats very difficult to (91:40 - 91:44)
utilize because you can't really afford (91:42 - 91:46)
a Pokemon that can only attack every (91:44 - 91:49)
other turn however we're still going to (91:46 - 91:51)
try to make it work it's worth noting (91:49 - 91:53)
that you can still switch out after you (91:51 - 91:56)
make that first attack so perhaps these (91:53 - 91:58)
legs are so high yeah it's a pace that's (91:56 - 92:00)
an incredibly high because its ability (91:58 - 92:04)
is probably uh actually slow start might (92:00 - 92:07)
be even well no I would say that true (92:04 - 92:09)
and is worse than slow start so I'm also (92:07 - 92:11)
to as a point of correction it's pre (92:09 - 92:14)
evolution slakoth Ozma has truant that's (92:11 - 92:16)
true yeah I guess you're right Vigoroth (92:14 - 92:18)
is the only one in the one that doesn't (92:16 - 92:20)
have it I forgot it let slakoth also had (92:18 - 92:23)
it um i think what i was saying yeah so (92:20 - 92:25)
you can still switch out after that (92:23 - 92:29)
first turn so if you use an attack your (92:25 - 92:30)
first turn you can switch to another (92:29 - 92:32)
pokemon and then not really how (92:30 - 92:36)
the disadvantage of having to wait for (92:32 - 92:39)
the truant turn but that might require (92:36 - 92:41)
you to make a switch once lacking is the (92:39 - 92:44)
best pokemon have out it's kind of (92:41 - 92:46)
predictable that you're not going to (92:44 - 92:48)
want to do nothing so it you could be (92:46 - 92:50)
easily punished for it so you're putting (92:48 - 92:54)
a bad spot so there's two schools of (92:50 - 92:55)
thought for your first move you're (92:54 - 92:56)
definitely going to want a very strong (92:55 - 92:59)
normal type move for same type attack (92:56 - 93:00)
bonus first school of thought is the one (92:59 - 93:04)
that is a little trickier with your (93:00 - 93:05)
ability which is giga impact the thought (93:04 - 93:08)
here is if i'm not going to be able to (93:05 - 93:10)
attack my second turn at all i don't (93:08 - 93:11)
care about the fact that giga impact (93:10 - 93:16)
needs to recharge so i can i'm only (93:11 - 93:17)
attacking every other turn anyway I (93:16 - 93:19)
might as well use giga impact very (93:17 - 93:24)
strong move can take out Pokemon it can (93:19 - 93:25)
take out a whole bunch of Pokemon even (93:24 - 93:28)
defensive ones in like two hits very (93:25 - 93:31)
strong problem is you can't switch out (93:28 - 93:32)
after you do that and do the thing I (93:31 - 93:36)
just talked about so you're what you (93:32 - 93:38)
gain in base power you lose in some (93:36 - 93:41)
versatility the safer option although I (93:38 - 93:43)
think it's a lot less fun a lot less (93:41 - 93:45)
cool if you wanted to be safe and be (93:43 - 93:46)
able to switch out after you use your (93:45 - 93:49)
main same type attack bonus move you'll (93:46 - 93:52)
go with return or frustration depending (93:49 - 93:54)
on if you want your slacking to like you (93:52 - 93:58)
or not that also requires you if you're (93:54 - 94:00)
not r ng Eng or playing on a simulator (93:58 - 94:03)
to actually make your slacking love you (94:00 - 94:07)
um good luck with that you hurt your (94:03 - 94:10)
second move so we kind of are going a (94:07 - 94:13)
similar line as we went with Oh what (94:10 - 94:15)
even was our book my other week last (94:13 - 94:19)
time was small X no yes nice yeah I (94:15 - 94:22)
thought what's neural x I think we did (94:19 - 94:23)
something after that anyway we talked (94:22 - 94:25)
before about a Pokemon with a pretty (94:23 - 94:28)
poor move pool that was normal type it (94:25 - 94:31)
was something that had guts it what are (94:28 - 94:33)
we talked about that had guts (94:31 - 94:37)
Raticate radical a here we are so uh (94:33 - 94:39)
slacking is on the other side of Radek a (94:37 - 94:42)
raticate was trouble because um it (94:39 - 94:45)
didn't really have any good type (94:42 - 94:46)
coverage to be able to deal with things (94:45 - 94:48)
that normal types typically can't but (94:46 - 94:51)
luckily with slacking you do have access (94:48 - 94:53)
to earthquake that covers rock type and (94:51 - 94:56)
steel type two types that you would only (94:53 - 94:58)
be not very effective against with your (94:56 - 95:01)
normal type moves and you actually still (94:58 - 95:04)
have an option for ghost types you (95:01 - 95:07)
actually have two options one is pursuit (95:04 - 95:09)
if you're trying to take out the (95:07 - 95:12)
trickier ghost types that are more (95:09 - 95:13)
sweeper oriented that are trying to get (95:12 - 95:16)
in and get out and deal some damage or (95:13 - 95:18)
if you want to just deal with the (95:16 - 95:22)
bulkier ones um the bulkier ghosts you (95:18 - 95:25)
can do night / night / is a little more (95:22 - 95:27)
generally effective so that's probably (95:25 - 95:28)
what you'll want to go with although (95:27 - 95:33)
pursuit can be quite effective against (95:28 - 95:36)
certain opponents that you anticipate (95:33 - 95:38)
will switch out a lot or certain team (95:36 - 95:41)
compositions that require that for your (95:38 - 95:43)
last move and this is where I'm going to (95:41 - 95:47)
deviate a little bit from convention I'm (95:43 - 95:50)
gonna say slack off you're not slack off (95:47 - 95:51)
nights for devolution I'm gonna say (95:50 - 95:54)
slack off it's the move that recovers (95:51 - 95:57)
your health by 50% I realize that it's (95:54 - 96:02)
kind of risky given that you you're (95:57 - 96:06)
essentially going three turns if it you (96:02 - 96:08)
know if if you attack your first turn (96:06 - 96:10)
slack off your second that's 3 full (96:08 - 96:11)
turns that you're not dealing damage to (96:10 - 96:14)
your opponent and that's kind of rough (96:11 - 96:16)
and you're just taking three hits and it (96:14 - 96:18)
might not end up helping you but if you (96:16 - 96:21)
can get a slack off to go off when you (96:18 - 96:22)
expect your opponent to switch that can (96:21 - 96:25)
be very beneficial um that's why I (96:22 - 96:28)
recommend it over something like encore (96:25 - 96:29)
or something that might be typically (96:28 - 96:32)
recommended which which is your you know (96:29 - 96:34)
another good option as well i also don't (96:32 - 96:41)
i'm not very compelled by the fast by (96:34 - 96:46)
investing your own nature and v's into (96:41 - 96:46)
speed (96:46 - 96:48)
need granted a hundred speed is nothing (96:46 - 96:51)
to you know nothing to be ashamed of (96:48 - 96:52)
that it's going to let speed a lot of (96:51 - 96:54)
Pokemon especially with investment but (96:52 - 96:58)
you have so much HP already in your in (96:54 - 97:00)
your base pool that it makes a lot more (96:58 - 97:03)
sense to me to invest your Eevee's in HP (97:00 - 97:06)
it means you might be able to survive a (97:03 - 97:09)
few more hits to to have more than one (97:06 - 97:12)
turn of action just makes a little more (97:09 - 97:15)
sense to me i'm sure people you know the (97:12 - 97:18)
people who make the the canonical move (97:15 - 97:22)
sets and things on places like smogon (97:18 - 97:25)
know better than me but um if you're (97:22 - 97:26)
trying to run slaking you don't really (97:25 - 97:28)
care what those people think anyway what (97:26 - 97:30)
if you can I can I throw a wrench in (97:28 - 97:34)
your mood set mm-hmm if it was a double (97:30 - 97:36)
battle what if you use one of those (97:34 - 97:38)
moves at switch abilities with slaking (97:36 - 97:44)
yeah you can do that um here is is that (97:38 - 97:48)
is is wasting that turn valuable enough (97:44 - 97:51)
because of how high slaking stats are (97:48 - 97:55)
not really wasting but taking it you (97:51 - 97:56)
could do some interesting things with it (97:55 - 97:58)
um there (97:56 - 98:02)
there's two um I guess there's one main (97:58 - 98:05)
problem i see first you have to run a (98:02 - 98:07)
pokemon i guess it's two problems first (98:05 - 98:09)
you have to run a pokemon the nose skill (98:07 - 98:15)
swap generally and if memory serves (98:09 - 98:18)
there aren't a lot of great pokemon that (98:15 - 98:21)
know it I'm looking actually no it's (98:18 - 98:23)
it's a TM so apparently a lot of book (98:21 - 98:25)
one can get it so scratch that problem I (98:23 - 98:28)
was in the main problem is that even if (98:25 - 98:29)
your skill swapping you still end up (98:28 - 98:31)
with a Pokemon that has truant because (98:29 - 98:33)
you just swapped it on to your other (98:31 - 98:37)
Pokemon and has about this alternative (98:33 - 98:42)
yeah egregious and have cough egregious (98:37 - 98:45)
attack you're slacking or have slacking (98:42 - 98:47)
touch cough cough Rodriguez the other (98:45 - 98:50)
way around yeah what if that's oh yeah I (98:47 - 98:53)
see what you're saying if this is a (98:50 - 98:57)
silly question if I skill swap with (98:53 - 99:00)
slacking and I now have through it looks (98:57 - 99:03)
like let's just say my Pikachu skill (99:00 - 99:05)
swap Dino Pikachu can't learn it ah and (99:03 - 99:07)
then I bring back my Pikachu and then I (99:05 - 99:09)
bring my Pikachu back out does he still (99:07 - 99:10)
have truant or just bringing him back (99:09 - 99:13)
just set his ability the ability would (99:10 - 99:15)
be reset you get your original ability (99:13 - 99:17)
back there you go (99:15 - 99:20)
it if you can pull it off and you can (99:17 - 99:23)
get those set up turns going it can be a (99:20 - 99:26)
very powerful effect what I would say (99:23 - 99:29)
more often than not you're going in to (99:26 - 99:31)
run into trouble getting that setup (99:29 - 99:32)
there's too many you know there's (99:31 - 99:35)
pokemon with taunt or there's heck (99:32 - 99:37)
you're talking about double battles so a (99:35 - 99:40)
fake-out is a very real thing that's (99:37 - 99:41)
just going to happen and ruin your (99:40 - 99:44)
dreams the stars would have to align for (99:41 - 99:46)
that first turn to go the way you want (99:44 - 99:48)
it to I would say it's very cool if you (99:46 - 99:51)
can pull it off though I don't think I'd (99:48 - 99:53)
really had anything more for the single (99:51 - 99:56)
set other than to say I would invest (99:53 - 99:59)
your Eevee's into HP and attack and then (99:56 - 100:00)
give it something like an adamant nature (99:59 - 100:05)
I mean I like on paper blacking looks (100:00 - 100:08)
great because of how high it's HP is and (100:05 - 100:10)
how high its attack is and it's almost (100:08 - 100:13)
like you could take a turn off because (100:10 - 100:14)
one you could survive that turn into (100:13 - 100:17)
because you can pretty much one shot a (100:14 - 100:22)
lot of things I feel mm-hmm but you run (100:17 - 100:25)
into problems because um okay so let's (100:22 - 100:27)
just go through the scenario even with (100:25 - 100:29)
the fast variant of slacking where (100:27 - 100:33)
you're investing in speed a lot of (100:29 - 100:36)
Pokemon better played competitively have (100:33 - 100:38)
speed stats that are above 100 100 is (100:36 - 100:41)
not a terrible speed but it's the same (100:38 - 100:42)
speed as like new and you don't (100:41 - 100:43)
typically think of you as like a (100:42 - 100:48)
hyper-fast pokemon in the and in the (100:43 - 100:49)
scheme of things so you're going to be (100:48 - 100:53)
out sped by a lot of stuff I see it you (100:49 - 100:57)
use your giga impact your first turn you (100:53 - 100:59)
might even want you probably even one (100:57 - 101:01)
hit KO a pokemon with it the next (100:59 - 101:03)
pokemon comes in it's something fast (101:01 - 101:06)
like let's just say it's um you know (101:03 - 101:11)
they switch into um yanmega yeah yeah I (101:06 - 101:12)
was trying to think of something that's (101:11 - 101:14)
super effective against because they're (101:12 - 101:15)
obviously going to go into like (101:14 - 101:16)
something with a fight they they switch (101:15 - 101:19)
into hey Molly yeah they switch into (101:16 - 101:22)
Hitmonlee they use whatever fighting (101:19 - 101:24)
move they have in the move set i jus I (101:22 - 101:27)
think that's Japan (101:24 - 101:28)
hi jump kick is very good this isn't (101:27 - 101:30)
like eighty percent and then it also has (101:28 - 101:32)
a recoil I believe it's ninety percent (101:30 - 101:37)
it does not have recoil if you lose the (101:32 - 101:39)
ninety percent then you take half of (101:37 - 101:41)
your damage or if you it deals if this (101:39 - 101:45)
is you take damage right correct um but (101:41 - 101:46)
it has such high base power that it (101:45 - 101:51)
still gets used um on money sweepers (101:46 - 101:52)
because they don't care that much about (101:51 - 101:53)
their health total because they get one (101:52 - 101:57)
shot anyway anyway sidetrack um so him (101:53 - 102:00)
only uses a high jump kick takes you (101:57 - 102:03)
down probably more than halfway it's (102:00 - 102:05)
super effective and then it out speeds (102:03 - 102:07)
you on the next turn and high jump kicks (102:05 - 102:10)
you anyway so it's after all of that (102:07 - 102:11)
pomp and circumstance of having this (102:10 - 102:13)
pokemon with an incredibly high attack (102:11 - 102:16)
you end up it ends up beat just being a (102:13 - 102:18)
one-for-one trade granted if you didn't (102:16 - 102:20)
run giga impact and ran return or (102:18 - 102:21)
something you could switch out that (102:20 - 102:24)
second turn but then you're giving your (102:21 - 102:28)
your opponent a free turn to deal damage (102:24 - 102:30)
to whatever pokemon you switch into so (102:28 - 102:32)
it's sort of a bad situation either way (102:30 - 102:35)
but i thought i think that that was one (102:32 - 102:38)
of your best analysis you've done thanks (102:35 - 102:41)
you've walked through some situations i (102:38 - 102:44)
like that flaking slacking however you (102:41 - 102:47)
want to call it during most of the day (102:44 - 102:51)
slacking law lols around and sleeps it (102:47 - 102:54)
is considered the laziest pokemon but (102:51 - 102:56)
even when it's lounging it is saving (102:54 - 102:59)
energy it can exert a lot of power by (102:56 - 103:01)
releasing built up energy at once it can (102:59 - 103:03)
regain loss energy through the use of (103:01 - 103:07)
its former signature move slack off (103:03 - 103:09)
slacking lives in force where it feeds (103:07 - 103:11)
on grass and ripen fruit that falls from (103:09 - 103:13)
trees it only moves around when there's (103:11 - 103:18)
no food within its reach to eat and if (103:13 - 103:22)
you get a shiny one it is like a blue no (103:18 - 103:24)
it's more like an orange back he kind of (103:22 - 103:29)
has like a light blue main i would say i (103:24 - 103:31)
and the shiny one is more of an orange (103:29 - 103:35)
main and the nose is a little more pink (103:31 - 103:36)
hitmonlee is actually slower than (103:35 - 103:39)
slacking I just I don't know that out (103:36 - 103:41)
I just found that out I've find that (103:39 - 103:44)
hard to believe but ok the trivia here (103:41 - 103:46)
is slacking has a lot of similarities to (103:44 - 103:49)
regigigas they're both normal type (103:46 - 103:52)
Pokemon they both have hidden hindering (103:49 - 103:55)
abilities truant and slow start they (103:52 - 103:58)
have the highest attack based stats out (103:55 - 104:00)
of all normal type Pokemon they also (103:58 - 104:04)
have the same base stat totals outside (104:00 - 104:06)
of legendary Pokemon and mega evolution (104:04 - 104:09)
slacking has the highest base that total (104:06 - 104:11)
of all Pokemon even surpassing pseudo (104:09 - 104:15)
legendary pokemon x 70 points in a (104:11 - 104:17)
double or triple battles 1 can nullify (104:15 - 104:20)
slacking strewn ability with either (104:17 - 104:24)
skill swap or gastro acid several (104:20 - 104:26)
trainers in pokemon emerald uses power (104:24 - 104:28)
including Norman during the players (104:26 - 104:31)
rematches with them the final boss in (104:28 - 104:34)
Pokemon Colosseum also did the same (104:31 - 104:37)
tactic without truants liking can make (104:34 - 104:40)
full use of its impressive stats this (104:37 - 104:42)
can be done in single this can also be (104:40 - 104:45)
done in single battles using a contact (104:42 - 104:48)
move with a pokemon like cough egregious (104:45 - 104:51)
that's that abilities mummy and in (104:48 - 104:54)
pre-alpha sketches it depicts this (104:51 - 104:58)
pokemon as a a pre-alpha sketch depicts (104:54 - 105:00)
a Pokemon that bears a striking (104:58 - 105:03)
resemblance to slacking obviously this (105:00 - 105:07)
is an audio podcast but oh yeah it does (105:03 - 105:13)
look like it looks like a look I just (105:07 - 105:15)
love the experience of half of the (105:13 - 105:18)
listener doesn't hearing Steve not even (105:15 - 105:20)
not even try to provide a visual (105:18 - 105:22)
description of what he's seeing and just (105:20 - 105:28)
going oh yeah so it's a real rudimentary (105:22 - 105:30)
drive it really is a really rough (105:28 - 105:33)
drawing it's really cute though so (105:30 - 105:36)
slacking is in this article with (105:33 - 105:41)
tyranitar and so you see it looks like (105:36 - 105:44)
it was sketched on like a napkin but you (105:41 - 105:46)
see it looks like a little baby (105:44 - 105:48)
kangaskhan it's obviously supposed to be (105:46 - 105:51)
tyranitar shooting a little fire out of (105:48 - 105:52)
his mouth and you slee see what (105:51 - 105:54)
like slacking except it looks like a (105:52 - 105:58)
bear with a baseball cap on and it says (105:54 - 106:01)
nothing is known about the first Pokemon (105:58 - 106:04)
Godzilla night it may have been a (106:01 - 106:06)
fire-type pokemon as shown as its (106:04 - 106:09)
breathing fire it's as its name implies (106:06 - 106:13)
is local likely based on Godzilla (106:09 - 106:16)
Godzilla night notably shares a (106:13 - 106:18)
resemblance to one of the fake pokemon (106:16 - 106:21)
toys Joan within the pocket monster mega (106:18 - 106:25)
Magna Man Man manga I can't feel like (106:21 - 106:29)
I'm saying here you go manga manga vol.1 (106:25 - 106:32)
the Japanese name of tyranitar is also (106:29 - 106:35)
based on Godzilla nothing is nothing is (106:32 - 106:38)
known about the second Pokemon gorilla (106:35 - 106:41)
marila mo gorilla mo it could be a (106:38 - 106:46)
reference to a character uh from a game (106:41 - 106:48)
called a pink anyways it's supposed to (106:46 - 106:52)
resemble yeah so the the default name in (106:48 - 106:55)
a knot earthbound but I believe the (106:52 - 106:57)
first mother game the default player (106:55 - 106:59)
named players name was nin 10 got it (106:57 - 107:01)
which is like a joke about Nintendo (106:59 - 107:05)
being in the same way that in earthbound (107:01 - 107:08)
or mother to the default name is ness (107:05 - 107:11)
which is like a reference to that yeah I (107:08 - 107:13)
know oh gosh I feel really silly i have (107:11 - 107:16)
it made me have it backwards i forget (107:13 - 107:18)
which but i think that's how it works I (107:16 - 107:20)
didn't think that neces name was based (107:18 - 107:23)
off the Nintendo internet entertainment (107:20 - 107:26)
system because I guess that makes sense (107:23 - 107:30)
it all comes full circle I resembles a (107:26 - 107:33)
