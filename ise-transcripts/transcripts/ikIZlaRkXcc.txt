what at Broadway Jim absolutely to (1:41 - 1:49)
celebrate 400 episodes this will not be (1:46 - 1:53)
a news focused show we have questions (1:49 - 1:54)
it's it's pretty much gonna be like a (1:53 - 1:56)
question only show like an email show (1:54 - 1:59)
except not emails they're one of these (1:56 - 2:01)
times you're gonna give me an extreme (1:59 - 2:03)
speed oh yeah maybe one that not that (2:01 - 2:05)
well look don't set it up too like it's (2:03 - 2:06)
gonna be later in the episode cuz it's (2:05 - 2:09)
not happy it's not it's not happening (2:06 - 2:12)
here's a clue for you Greg I've I've (2:09 - 2:15)
been on got at least 300 of these (2:12 - 2:18)
programs I've never had an extreme speed (2:15 - 2:28)
myself that classic nugget from the pre (2:18 - 2:28)
retired and I vote a glee buff I (2:29 - 2:35)
remember what the controversy around (2:33 - 2:40)
that size versus a glee buff (2:35 - 2:40)
I thought was close oh okay then I vote (2:40 - 2:45)
close I absolutely puff all the way clap (2:42 - 2:49)
we're gonna do questions pretty much the (2:45 - 2:51)
entire show and that's that's pretty (2:49 - 2:53)
much it quick updates here I still have (2:51 - 2:57)
skittle jaw how did you eat more no I (2:53 - 3:00)
didn't I was wrong with I do eat any (2:57 - 3:03)
more skittles Greg but my jaw still (3:00 - 3:04)
really hurts (3:03 - 3:08)
did you break skittle like I don't think (3:04 - 3:10)
so cuz throughout the day it doesn't (3:08 - 3:12)
hurt as much and then I go to bed and (3:10 - 3:14)
then I wake up and then it's bad again (3:12 - 3:16)
oh no you grind your teeth (3:14 - 3:18)
no it's grinding my teeth it would be on (3:16 - 3:22)
it wouldn't be one specific side yes it (3:18 - 3:24)
would yeah no I'm not grinding my teeth (3:22 - 3:26)
I can tell you exactly when the pain (3:24 - 3:28)
started it was when I bit into the (3:26 - 3:28)
skittles (3:28 - 3:31)
okay here's did you crack a tooth no no (3:28 - 3:34)
now here's what it is he sprained his (3:31 - 3:37)
jaw I think your jaw has muscles and (3:34 - 3:39)
then every night as he grinds his teeth (3:37 - 3:45)
he's do two things (3:39 - 3:47)
get yourself Invisalign because that'll (3:45 - 3:57)
keep you from grinding I'm an influencer (3:47 - 4:00)
[Music] (3:57 - 4:00)
well you're following me on my journey (4:01 - 4:06)
number 2 take some ibuprofen different (4:03 - 4:08)
bed I was taking advil that's not the (4:06 - 4:10)
same thing yeah it is ibuprofen and how (4:08 - 4:12)
many advils have you taken before you go (4:10 - 4:16)
to bed to the abb√© mm mm three you gotta (4:12 - 4:19)
take four before we get to the questions (4:16 - 4:22)
I did play some mystery dungeon and I (4:19 - 4:24)
just thought that I figured we'd bring (4:22 - 4:27)
it up otherwise our for mystery dungeon (4:24 - 4:28)
people who listen to the stream are (4:27 - 4:29)
gonna have a heart attack that we (4:28 - 4:31)
haven't talked about it there are quite (4:29 - 4:33)
a few fans of mystery dungeon thank you (4:31 - 4:37)
so you can can that attitude I very much (4:33 - 4:38)
would have bought it myself because the (4:37 - 4:42)
art is absolutely delightful it says (4:38 - 4:44)
it's just too proximate to Animal (4:42 - 4:47)
Crossing and Bill is very cheap and (4:44 - 4:50)
budget oriented the art is good in (4:47 - 4:53)
graphic in moving form you can kind of (4:50 - 4:53)
see the (4:53 - 4:56)
flaws in it it doesn't translate very (4:53 - 4:59)
well to movement it looks way better (4:56 - 5:02)
when it's not moving I'll say that steal (4:59 - 5:03)
pictures and when it's still it looks (5:02 - 5:05)
better move I would do Gore watching the (5:03 - 5:07)
stream the movement looks a little it (5:05 - 5:08)
looked a little weird how far did you (5:07 - 5:09)
get (5:08 - 5:11)
did you actually recruit somebody else (5:09 - 5:13)
no I didn't get to the recruiting I will (5:11 - 5:15)
this is probably not sport well I what (5:13 - 5:18)
is this a 15 year old game yet mean I (5:15 - 5:20)
played the original young 17 years old (5:18 - 5:23)
yes I got to the first boss battle which (5:20 - 5:24)
i think is the end of the tutorial (5:23 - 5:26)
completely which is against Skarmory (5:24 - 5:30)
yeah and then I saved the Diglett yep (5:26 - 5:31)
the three dads (5:30 - 5:34)
no mom but that's all right maybe the (5:31 - 5:36)
mom maybe I gotta save the mom later and (5:34 - 5:38)
hey the mom later but yeah I got to the (5:36 - 5:42)
Skarmory battle and did that and so I (5:38 - 5:45)
will say the quiz is extremely (5:42 - 5:48)
delightful it told me I was sassy (5:45 - 5:51)
cynical but lovable did you get the hand (5:48 - 5:54)
coming out of the toilet question no no (5:51 - 5:57)
that's why you ended up that way which (5:54 - 5:59)
sassy cynical and lovable is supposed to (5:57 - 6:03)
be Treecko and I decided to pick skiddy (5:59 - 6:06)
because I like skinny a lot and then my (6:03 - 6:08)
partner I picked his Psyduck so I was (6:06 - 6:09)
very happy with the quiz I thought that (6:08 - 6:11)
was really well done except you didn't (6:09 - 6:15)
accept the result no I did the laws of (6:11 - 6:17)
history show he's okay (6:15 - 6:22)
I mean he's fine he's no skiddy he's no (6:17 - 6:22)
cubone either it does ask you bone it (6:22 - 6:28)
does ask you at the end if you are uh (6:25 - 6:30)
like a boy or a girl like the same (6:28 - 6:32)
Pokemon question that Professor Oak (6:30 - 6:35)
would ask you and I'm assuming that like (6:32 - 6:37)
because I said I'm a boy that's why they (6:35 - 6:39)
defaulted to Treecko I bet if I was to (6:37 - 6:41)
say girl Treecko wouldn't have been an (6:39 - 6:43)
option and it would probably gave me I (6:41 - 6:44)
don't know what what is like I said what (6:43 - 6:46)
would this sassy girl Pokemon be I would (6:44 - 6:48)
almost say it's probably skiddy (6:46 - 6:50)
so that's not a hundred percent true (6:48 - 6:52)
some of the nature's are differentiated (6:50 - 6:54)
by gender some of the nature's are not (6:52 - 6:58)
but so I can't remember I can look it up (6:54 - 7:00)
well that's cheating then then you look (6:58 - 7:03)
with Melvin you already did it it's not (7:00 - 7:07)
cheating if you already did it maybe ok (7:03 - 7:07)
so again this is (7:07 - 7:09)
just my quick review getting up to the (7:07 - 7:11)
Skarmory or my input oh I should also (7:09 - 7:14)
probably disclose that I guess skitty (7:11 - 7:16)
would have been hasty (7:14 - 7:19)
he hasn't been hasty to get skinny if (7:16 - 7:22)
you had said girl you had gotten Torchic (7:19 - 7:24)
oh okay (7:22 - 7:27)
I like Torchic full disclosure I did not (7:24 - 7:29)
pay for mystery dungeon it was sent to (7:27 - 7:33)
me by Nintendo big big Papa Doug Bowser (7:29 - 7:36)
sent it my way everyone says that (7:33 - 7:39)
mystery dungeons story is incredible I (7:36 - 7:42)
am only like two hours in and the (7:39 - 7:45)
dialogue is I don't know pretty (7:42 - 7:48)
like this this mystery dungeon well (7:45 - 7:51)
that's that's just like the default of (7:48 - 7:52)
like mystery dungeons is like how the (7:51 - 7:56)
story so good I think for the sequels I (7:52 - 7:58)
don't think for the original the story (7:56 - 8:03)
is okay well your dialogue is very it's (7:58 - 8:05)
just it's it's it's just standard (8:03 - 8:07)
Pokemon dialogue it's like hey so-and-so (8:05 - 8:10)
we need to go save this Diglett and then (8:07 - 8:13)
the it's just like okay it's like okay (8:10 - 8:16)
this is the Oh like the dialogue you (8:13 - 8:18)
guys are all raving about No (8:16 - 8:21)
okay sky and dialogue our story is (8:18 - 8:23)
different the serene dialogue are (8:21 - 8:26)
different the story does tend to get (8:23 - 8:29)
good the dialogue is very simple (8:26 - 8:30)
throughout the whole thing but like I (8:29 - 8:32)
feel like the dialogue adds to the story (8:30 - 8:36)
though no it came down it can but and I (8:32 - 8:39)
don't think in this case it takes away (8:36 - 8:41)
from this like once you've gotten past (8:39 - 8:42)
where you are and you've learned (8:41 - 8:45)
everything about the game like it starts (8:42 - 8:47)
getting the dialogue starts picking up (8:45 - 8:50)
more and more things start happening it (8:47 - 8:52)
does suffer like all of them because I (8:50 - 8:54)
think this was the first this is the (8:52 - 8:56)
first pokemon mystery dungeon crossover (8:54 - 8:59)
yeah I think so yeah yeah well cuz (8:56 - 9:02)
you're judging games like fun fantasy (8:59 - 9:04)
has a mystery dungeon yeah oh yes yes (9:02 - 9:06)
this was the first Pokemon mystery done (9:04 - 9:09)
so they have a very they had an (9:06 - 9:11)
unfortunately long tutorial because (9:09 - 9:13)
nobody (9:11 - 9:15)
had probably played a mystery dungeon (9:13 - 9:18)
game who had played Pokemon like this (9:15 - 9:20)
was the first introduction to this so I (9:18 - 9:23)
think the I I do sort of remember like (9:20 - 9:24)
okay I get it (9:23 - 9:26)
alright I've learned everything I get it (9:24 - 9:28)
but I think the tutorial for this was (9:26 - 9:30)
longer than it needed to be like the Sun (9:28 - 9:33)
and Moon issue but then it does pick up (9:30 - 9:34)
like what's your past that you know (9:33 - 9:36)
about bosses you know up picking up jobs (9:34 - 9:39)
you know about what all the shops are it (9:36 - 9:42)
gets it gets more interesting especially (9:39 - 9:44)
when you have more freedom (9:42 - 9:47)
so like the tutorial is a good (9:44 - 9:50)
introduction to how the game works but I (9:47 - 9:51)
don't think is a great introduction to (9:50 - 9:54)
how the story will go how the dialogue (9:51 - 9:57)
ends up being once you've gotten past (9:54 - 9:58)
that and it's not holding your hand (9:57 - 10:00)
anymore went into being very optimistic (9:58 - 10:03)
I my mystery dungeon experience prior to (10:00 - 10:06)
this who was playing my first one was (10:03 - 10:08)
gates to infinity which a lot of people (10:06 - 10:12)
say is bad and I got all the way up to (10:08 - 10:14)
the con Kaldur at the top of the (10:12 - 10:16)
mountain and gets to infinity which is I (10:14 - 10:18)
believe the first boss and then I (10:16 - 10:21)
stopped playing and then I did play two (10:18 - 10:25)
to three hours of explorers of sky and I (10:21 - 10:27)
played that with Irene and Irene was (10:25 - 10:30)
very not interested in it in about an (10:27 - 10:33)
hour she thought was kind of boring but (10:30 - 10:36)
I do remember the the coughing in it but (10:33 - 10:39)
that's all I remember and I left that (10:36 - 10:42)
game pretty unimpressed as well I will (10:39 - 10:46)
say that after how long did I play Greg (10:42 - 10:48)
like two and a half three hours on (10:46 - 10:52)
stream um I left so I left at about two (10:48 - 10:54)
hours and you're still playing okay yeah (10:52 - 10:55)
so it must have been I probably wrapped (10:54 - 10:58)
up a little bit after you left but I I (10:55 - 11:01)
am excited to continue playing it but I (10:58 - 11:03)
will say I the thing that turned me off (11:01 - 11:06)
from those first two games and that's (11:03 - 11:08)
still an issue here is the combat I (11:06 - 11:11)
don't think it's particularly fun and I (11:08 - 11:13)
still don't think it's fun here but I do (11:11 - 11:16)
I will say the auto battle thing which i (11:13 - 11:19)
think is new makes up for that the atom (11:16 - 11:22)
movement the autumn like the you can (11:19 - 11:24)
press I think it's the L button and your (11:22 - 11:26)
characters will like default and go to (11:24 - 11:27)
the (11:26 - 11:29)
that if they need to pick up and they'll (11:27 - 11:30)
explore on their own (11:29 - 11:33)
I think that's Auto explore but there's (11:30 - 11:35)
no auto combat the auto explore actually (11:33 - 11:37)
stops when you're into a combat (11:35 - 11:39)
situation yeah and I think they (11:37 - 11:40)
introduced that in the later games a (11:39 - 11:41)
pretty sure you could do that in the (11:40 - 11:43)
later games the auto explore the auto (11:41 - 11:46)
combat auto explore if there is there is (11:43 - 11:48)
no auto calm there's no the auto combat (11:46 - 11:49)
is I just press the a button and the (11:48 - 11:52)
game figures out the best attack yeah (11:49 - 11:54)
that's pretty Auto to me well but you (11:52 - 11:57)
could choose from a variety of attacks (11:54 - 11:58)
that's actually one of my biggest (11:57 - 12:01)
complaints about mystery dungeon is that (11:58 - 12:04)
you just had to like memorize all these (12:01 - 12:09)
button combos yeah press LZ I think and (12:04 - 12:10)
it will show the four attacks and then (12:09 - 12:12)
you can pick it yeah I'm most not yes (12:10 - 12:14)
you have to memorize this I'm just not (12:12 - 12:16)
interested (12:14 - 12:20)
like if I'm fighting a Zubat and I'm (12:16 - 12:22)
going to do the electric move the game (12:20 - 12:24)
is smart enough to go zubats weak to (12:22 - 12:25)
electric so I'm gonna use skitty's (12:24 - 12:28)
charge beam and that's fine that's good (12:25 - 12:30)
enough for me like I'm not here for like (12:28 - 12:33)
the one time I did stop and I was like (12:30 - 12:36)
okay I I need to the Skarmory is about (12:33 - 12:39)
to kill me I need to like not move (12:36 - 12:40)
because if you don't move they don't (12:39 - 12:43)
move yep so I'm not gonna spam the a (12:40 - 12:45)
button I'm gonna like press the LZ I'm (12:43 - 12:47)
gonna look at my attacks my fart i and (12:45 - 12:48)
it was a disaster I was like I don't (12:47 - 12:51)
know how this combat works I don't know (12:48 - 12:53)
if like if I turn (12:51 - 12:55)
does that count for a movement even (12:53 - 12:57)
though I'm still in the same square and (12:55 - 13:00)
I like tried I like hit the a button on (12:57 - 13:02)
accident no one was near me so skiddy (13:00 - 13:04)
did a spin but that counts is moving and (13:02 - 13:06)
so Skarmory gets it like it was just a (13:04 - 13:08)
complete mess and I was like you know (13:06 - 13:10)
what I'm just gonna keep pressing a (13:08 - 13:13)
button and let it auto because it was (13:10 - 13:18)
not fun to like hold the LZ it's it's (13:13 - 13:20)
not the strength of the game I was a lot (13:18 - 13:23)
unless I'm like that maybe I'm just (13:20 - 13:25)
terrible that video you are oh you are (13:23 - 13:28)
you are yes you are 100% I mean for a (13:25 - 13:30)
lot of things yes you can probably add a (13:28 - 13:32)
button to get through the boss battles (13:30 - 13:34)
like when you get seeds when you get (13:32 - 13:37)
other things those become more important (13:34 - 13:39)
to be able to use so like picking up (13:37 - 13:41)
rocks so that if you (13:39 - 13:43)
rid of all of your distance attacks you (13:41 - 13:44)
can still hit things at a distance (13:43 - 13:47)
because you can throw rocks at things as (13:44 - 13:49)
they move towards you and not waste your (13:47 - 13:53)
moves sleep seeds throwing berserk seats (13:49 - 13:55)
like confusion seeds I mean the game (13:53 - 13:58)
does get more complicated and the bosses (13:55 - 14:00)
do get a lot harder where you have to (13:58 - 14:02)
get more creative than just hitting the (14:00 - 14:05)
a button like there is a depth to that (14:02 - 14:07)
to all of the games that I think they do (14:05 - 14:11)
pretty well but you do sort of like it (14:07 - 14:14)
isn't I agree that it's not intuitive (14:11 - 14:16)
it's not a very intuitive system you do (14:14 - 14:19)
sort of have to memorize what all the (14:16 - 14:21)
seeds do and what you have like what you (14:19 - 14:26)
have to do going on later missions it (14:21 - 14:27)
becomes very important what you're (14:26 - 14:29)
bringing with you so you want to bring (14:27 - 14:32)
like I need four apples I want to bring (14:29 - 14:34)
X seeds because I know I'm gonna face a (14:32 - 14:36)
boss but I also need to leave enough (14:34 - 14:38)
space so that while I'm in the dungeon I (14:36 - 14:40)
can pick everything up that's in there (14:38 - 14:42)
like you sort of have to strike the (14:40 - 14:44)
balance between what's the minimum I can (14:42 - 14:48)
bring to deal with what I see in there (14:44 - 14:51)
versus I still need to have space to (14:48 - 14:55)
pick up things in the dungeon plus they (14:51 - 14:57)
haven't even at the point where you're (14:55 - 14:58)
in the game they haven't even done (14:57 - 15:02)
monster houses yet which is just the (14:58 - 15:04)
absolute fear in that game when you run (15:02 - 15:06)
into a monster house I can see the (15:04 - 15:08)
appeal and I think that's the thing I (15:06 - 15:10)
was excited about I don't know if this (15:08 - 15:13)
is if this was a change but like the (15:10 - 15:14)
first thing I thought of when I saw the (15:13 - 15:17)
bulletin board was oh they're gonna make (15:14 - 15:19)
me only take one mission at a time but (15:17 - 15:22)
it don't let me take 4 or 5 or something (15:19 - 15:23)
it was like okay that's awesome because (15:22 - 15:26)
three of these four are in the same cave (15:23 - 15:29)
then I was like oh okay let me pick up (15:26 - 15:31)
three I bet as soon as I complete one (15:29 - 15:33)
it's gonna kick me out but it when you (15:31 - 15:35)
complete the first mission it was like (15:33 - 15:36)
oh you can keep going if you want and I (15:35 - 15:38)
was like oh this is awesome like I can I (15:36 - 15:41)
can do all three in a run and then the (15:38 - 15:44)
risk reward is I'm either like I don't (15:41 - 15:45)
have enough apples and I'm gonna get too (15:44 - 15:48)
fatigued or I'm out of healing items and (15:45 - 15:49)
I'll have to back out and that was like (15:48 - 15:51)
the appealing part to me that was the (15:49 - 15:53)
part I actually liked not like the (15:51 - 15:54)
combat or the (15:53 - 15:57)
saving the Diglett the risk/reward of (15:54 - 16:00)
like I can go deeper into this cave and (15:57 - 16:03)
knock out all these missions if I am (16:00 - 16:04)
well-prepared and I think that is that (16:03 - 16:06)
was the fun part to me (16:04 - 16:08)
yep and it gets more complicated the (16:06 - 16:10)
more places that you open up like there (16:08 - 16:12)
are some jobs where it's just like okay (16:10 - 16:15)
the first job is on the second floor and (16:12 - 16:19)
the last job is on the 18th floor is (16:15 - 16:21)
that something that I want to do right (16:19 - 16:23)
now because the reward for the 18th (16:21 - 16:25)
floor one is huge is that do I want to (16:23 - 16:29)
spend 18 going through 8 like am I gonna (16:25 - 16:30)
go through all 18 to get there is like (16:29 - 16:33)
there's a lot to that risk reward system (16:30 - 16:35)
that's very interesting I mean it gets (16:33 - 16:36)
more interesting the more you play the (16:35 - 16:40)
game but again like but everyday thing (16:36 - 16:42)
is like every dungeon it's random which (16:40 - 16:43)
is the other thing that I I've always (16:42 - 16:45)
found fascinating about the game cuz you (16:43 - 16:46)
never like even if you were in that (16:45 - 16:49)
dungeon before it's not the same when (16:46 - 16:51)
you go back in yeah yeah I mean that's (16:49 - 16:53)
that's what's like so core oh yeah to (16:51 - 16:56)
the whole mystery dungeon it's it the (16:53 - 16:58)
dungeon is a mystery it's right in the (16:56 - 17:00)
name and like some people are like I (16:58 - 17:03)
don't want the dungeons to be randomized (17:00 - 17:04)
and it was like well number one you're (17:03 - 17:08)
playing the wrong game then step back I (17:04 - 17:10)
mean one of the things I also don't like (17:08 - 17:13)
is I actually don't like the auto (17:10 - 17:16)
explore because what that really kind of (17:13 - 17:18)
reveals for me is that the point of the (17:16 - 17:20)
game is all about prepping for the (17:18 - 17:22)
dungeon and not what you actually do in (17:20 - 17:24)
the dungeon oh I think the run is the (17:22 - 17:27)
good part that ok but for me that's I (17:24 - 17:31)
don't I the video game to actually do (17:27 - 17:33)
stuff it's not cookie clicker here you (17:31 - 17:35)
know I want to actually love a good (17:33 - 17:39)
cookie clicker yeah like a trims myself (17:35 - 17:43)
but you stream shrimps at one point for (17:39 - 17:46)
$60 on my switch I if I'm sitting on my (17:43 - 17:48)
couch in my living room with my 75 inch (17:46 - 17:50)
television I want to be engaged with the (17:48 - 17:53)
content not if watching my Cuban run (17:50 - 17:59)
through coupon Cuban I I would agree (17:53 - 18:01)
with you will if there were more to the (17:59 - 18:04)
dungeons besides like 4 items on a floor (18:01 - 18:06)
you could pick up which that's what I (18:04 - 18:08)
noticed right away and I was like (18:06 - 18:09)
maybe it's just these early dungeons and (18:08 - 18:13)
maybe they do get significantly but like (18:09 - 18:15)
besides empty rooms with enemies or like (18:13 - 18:17)
heel pads I was like I'm just picking up (18:15 - 18:19)
like an Oran berry like why there's no (18:17 - 18:22)
puzzles like there's no puzzles to solve (18:19 - 18:24)
to get through the dungeons other then (18:22 - 18:26)
let me make sure that I've got enough (18:24 - 18:28)
you know the kit in my bag to get (18:26 - 18:32)
through this thing there are some I mean (18:28 - 18:35)
so at later dungeons you get the shops (18:32 - 18:37)
leader dungeons you get the monster (18:35 - 18:40)
houses like they they do change it up as (18:37 - 18:43)
the difficulty ramps up there are spas (18:40 - 18:45)
there are hidden things to find if they (18:43 - 18:47)
were generated so to say that it's (18:45 - 18:49)
always the same I don't think is fair (18:47 - 18:53)
but you may not find the little things (18:49 - 18:56)
that they add in interesting enough to (18:53 - 18:59)
do X amount of floors of random (18:56 - 19:01)
generated dungeons like they do get more (18:59 - 19:04)
complicated there are more complicated (19:01 - 19:06)
things to do but they do come very late (19:04 - 19:10)
in the game and they may not be you I (19:06 - 19:12)
mean for some people it's too late you (19:10 - 19:14)
know it's too little too late like (19:12 - 19:15)
there's just not enough oh absolutely (19:14 - 19:17)
oh you didn't you didn't grab my (19:15 - 19:19)
attention with you know an hour and a (19:17 - 19:22)
half's worth of play I'm not putting (19:19 - 19:24)
more time in it like the recruitment (19:22 - 19:27)
parts are like part of it I haven't (19:24 - 19:28)
gotten there I know it's gonna be (19:27 - 19:30)
frustrating to me is is recruitment is (19:28 - 19:33)
frustrating it can be finding the scars (19:30 - 19:35)
to make recruitment easier buying those (19:33 - 19:37)
things like that's all part of the (19:35 - 19:39)
equipping to make that process better (19:37 - 19:42)
but it's still it's still like you have (19:39 - 19:45)
no real control over who you recruit (19:42 - 19:49)
like it is a random chance after that (19:45 - 19:52)
unlocks that whoever you defeat in a (19:49 - 19:55)
dungeon will join you like there are (19:52 - 19:57)
ways to manipulate it but it's still not (19:55 - 19:59)
it's not a given like you can find that (19:57 - 20:02)
shiny and it could be like nope (19:59 - 20:07)
I'm out um overall I yeah I guess I I (20:02 - 20:09)
don't regret my time with it I think (20:07 - 20:11)
it's I think it's fun I want to see (20:09 - 20:15)
where it goes more I guess both of you (20:11 - 20:17)
didn't think it was worth the 60 bucks (20:15 - 20:19)
so I mean I had played it before I've (20:17 - 20:22)
played that game completely before (20:19 - 20:25)
and when looking at it thinking I'm (20:22 - 20:27)
still very heavily invested in sword and (20:25 - 20:31)
shield yes I may be investing in Animal (20:27 - 20:32)
Crossing I'm still deciding I have a lot (20:31 - 20:35)
of friends who want me to that I you do (20:32 - 20:38)
you bud you did a game the game that (20:35 - 20:41)
game coming in between these two things (20:38 - 20:44)
I was like I know how heavily I can get (20:41 - 20:46)
into mystery dungeon is not a short game (20:44 - 20:49)
I'll play it a lot the other games that (20:46 - 20:51)
are I'm playing still have my attention (20:49 - 20:53)
right now like Final Fantasy just (20:51 - 20:55)
released another huge patch it's got a (20:53 - 20:56)
whole bunch of new dungeons that I'm (20:55 - 20:59)
working through I'm still doing raids in (20:56 - 21:00)
sword and shield and that eats up that (20:59 - 21:04)
time it just I didn't feel that I wanted (21:00 - 21:07)
to pay $60 to play again that I've (21:04 - 21:09)
already played I played it the first (21:07 - 21:12)
time I liked it the first time I didn't (21:09 - 21:14)
think there was enough changes in this (21:12 - 21:16)
version to warrant me playing it again I (21:14 - 21:18)
mean it's mostly like updated art and (21:16 - 21:21)
nostalgia yeah a different piece di the (21:18 - 21:22)
different ways of doing rescues and (21:21 - 21:25)
everything for me like if it what it (21:22 - 21:28)
really boils down to is if I had more (21:25 - 21:33)
time and Animal Crossing wasn't just (21:28 - 21:34)
like right on the horizon next week (21:33 - 21:37)
which I know I want to spend my time (21:34 - 21:40)
with Animal Crossing I definitely would (21:37 - 21:41)
have bought this game I got that I (21:40 - 21:43)
downloaded the demo I enjoyed the demo (21:41 - 21:45)
and it's like if I had more time I would (21:43 - 21:48)
have made this my game that I play every (21:45 - 21:50)
morning you know when I first wake up (21:48 - 21:51)
and like do a dungeon every morning or (21:50 - 21:55)
something stupid like that but I I know (21:51 - 21:57)
I'm gonna invest heavily in Animal (21:55 - 22:00)
Crossing and be disappointed in a month (21:57 - 22:01)
and a half and then maybe I'll come back (22:00 - 22:04)
to mystery dungeon at least for that (22:01 - 22:06)
month and a half Animal Crossing is (22:04 - 22:07)
gonna have my attention (22:06 - 22:10)
you know this guy will be there Animal (22:07 - 22:12)
Crossing for me is like a top 5 game of (22:10 - 22:15)
all time but they did really say it's no (22:12 - 22:16)
Katamari Damacy (22:15 - 22:21)
did release multiple games that I did (22:16 - 22:23)
not like before so that's why I'm like (22:21 - 22:25)
very hesitant I know people are over the (22:23 - 22:27)
moon and excited and if there's like a (22:25 - 22:29)
single new flower and showing off an (22:27 - 22:31)
animal crossing and alienating like an (22:29 - 22:35)
18 thread post on Twitter about how this (22:31 - 22:38)
new flower is amazing but I just can't (22:35 - 22:42)
help but remember we game was so bad oh (22:38 - 22:49)
stop stop stop I love the weekend just (22:42 - 22:51)
okay generally from your let's put it (22:49 - 22:53)
this right from your perspective it was (22:51 - 22:55)
bad from my perspective it was (22:53 - 23:01)
absolutely fantastic and I adored it but (22:55 - 23:03)
my advice is no wild world and it was no (23:01 - 23:06)
new leaf I mean I think I only really (23:03 - 23:09)
played new leaf which was the ds1 wild (23:06 - 23:12)
world yet that was probably a crowning (23:09 - 23:14)
achievement whole franchise yeah how do (23:12 - 23:17)
you follow up one of the button the best (23:14 - 23:22)
Animal Crossing game ever yeah I mean we (23:17 - 23:38)
bad town remember advice for anybody who (23:22 - 23:42)
is you know either just like not one of (23:38 - 23:43)
those it's Animal Crossing I'm gonna get (23:42 - 23:45)
it and love it doesn't matter what it is (23:43 - 23:46)
because it has the Animal Crossing name (23:45 - 23:47)
on it so it was like if you've never (23:46 - 23:50)
played before if you've been away from (23:47 - 23:54)
it for a while and coming back or you (23:50 - 23:56)
know it's just like my one piece of (23:54 - 24:00)
advice is for when you first start it (23:56 - 24:03)
but I would say even like for a week (24:00 - 24:06)
don't discuss it with anybody play it on (24:03 - 24:07)
your own terms (24:06 - 24:10)
learn about the game understand the game (24:07 - 24:12)
on your own terms because the minute you (24:10 - 24:15)
start talking to other people and (24:12 - 24:17)
especially if you talk to the real anime (24:15 - 24:19)
Nia and it will cross what is what are (24:17 - 24:21)
the people who are very into Animal (24:19 - 24:23)
Crossing I really the X cross heads the (24:21 - 24:24)
cross heads (24:23 - 24:27)
yeah and they start telling you about (24:24 - 24:29)
like all the achievements that they've (24:27 - 24:31)
already unlocked in the secret areas (24:29 - 24:33)
they've unlocked and they've got this in (24:31 - 24:34)
their town and that in their time and (24:33 - 24:36)
you're gonna be like well I'm not going (24:34 - 24:39)
that fast and now I feel bad there's (24:36 - 24:42)
like this uncontrollable psychological (24:39 - 24:44)
impact that you will have that you're (24:42 - 24:45)
going to feel bad because you're not (24:44 - 24:47)
making as much progress as other people (24:45 - 24:49)
and just (24:47 - 24:51)
like save yourself from that keep your (24:49 - 24:53)
animal crossing' experience to yourself (24:51 - 24:56)
for a while until you feel like you have (24:53 - 24:58)
accomplished enough and you're at a (24:56 - 25:00)
point where you want to ask other people (24:58 - 25:02)
for advice on how to get things because (25:00 - 25:05)
then it's less about feeling bad that (25:02 - 25:07)
you fell behind but more like I've (25:05 - 25:08)
gotten to this point was I've gotten as (25:07 - 25:11)
far as I can get on my own and it's time (25:08 - 25:13)
for me to reach out to others so I can (25:11 - 25:15)
get even further now you're gonna you're (25:13 - 25:17)
gonna be behind off the bat if you (25:15 - 25:19)
didn't find five other friends with the (25:17 - 25:20)
different fruits to get the fruits to (25:19 - 25:23)
plant (25:20 - 25:23)
better fruits to themselves for the (25:23 - 25:27)
money and so then you can start but like (25:25 - 25:31)
I either fruits for a while I'm just (25:27 - 25:34)
saying for an enjoyable experience of (25:31 - 25:37)
like creating and crafting your own town (25:34 - 25:40)
which is the core of the Animal Crossing (25:37 - 25:43)
experience do it on your own for a while (25:40 - 25:46)
no I agree with what you said well I do (25:43 - 25:47)
agree that there's the psychological (25:46 - 25:50)
thing where like somebody has like five (25:47 - 25:52)
public work projects in the first week (25:50 - 25:53)
and you don't and sometimes that just (25:52 - 25:56)
comes down to luck sometimes like well (25:53 - 25:57)
in past games it was just like oh (25:56 - 25:59)
so-and-so was able to say the right (25:57 - 26:01)
thing in the right time frame and you (25:59 - 26:03)
know you can build a lighthouse and you (26:01 - 26:05)
know I played the game for six months (26:03 - 26:07)
and I never got anyone to offer me to (26:05 - 26:08)
build a lighthouse even though you know (26:07 - 26:10)
I did everything the guide said to do (26:08 - 26:12)
but they're still like this hidden (26:10 - 26:14)
percent chance that you might not be (26:12 - 26:16)
offered to build the lighthouse like I I (26:14 - 26:17)
get it (26:16 - 26:19)
but yeah it was it was frustrating (26:17 - 26:23)
during new leaf to see everyone on (26:19 - 26:24)
Twitter posting all that all their (26:23 - 26:27)
public works or all their cool things (26:24 - 26:32)
and and by I didn't get offered those (26:27 - 26:36)
things even though I was playing just as (26:32 - 26:40)
much or or like I have no clue if they (26:36 - 26:42)
they time hopped and that's why they (26:40 - 26:44)
have 18 public work projects in a week (26:42 - 26:46)
none of this makes sense that anyone (26:44 - 26:47)
who's played on will crossing they (26:46 - 26:49)
probably what's the Public Works I don't (26:47 - 26:50)
even know if there's Public Works in (26:49 - 26:54)
this game I'm not sure I don't I've (26:50 - 26:56)
watched the one Nintendo Direct kind of (26:54 - 26:59)
and happy to know that time hopping will (26:56 - 27:02)
not be possible thank you to the (26:59 - 27:03)
incorporation of the (27:02 - 27:05)
see you people will still be able to (27:03 - 27:07)
tell hot they won't be able to time hop (27:05 - 27:09)
to a season but they'll still be a (27:07 - 27:11)
person but they won't be able to do (27:09 - 27:14)
events sure so they could still put you (27:11 - 27:17)
know a thousand bells in a bank and set (27:14 - 27:20)
it five years in the future to whatever (27:17 - 27:22)
interest rate that is don't don't tell (27:20 - 27:30)
these people about secrets I'm very (27:22 - 27:33)
excited for animal crossing but I but (27:30 - 27:36)
going back to mystery dungeon I did hear (27:33 - 27:41)
that same opinion that oh I would have (27:36 - 27:44)
picked up mystery dungeon but I didn't (27:41 - 27:47)
want to spend $120 this month and I only (27:44 - 27:49)
have 60 bucks and if it's between (27:47 - 27:51)
mystery dungeon or animal crossing I'm (27:49 - 27:52)
gonna buy Animal Crossing I've heard (27:51 - 27:54)
that so much in the past two week the (27:52 - 27:56)
timing the timing is real rough and I (27:54 - 28:00)
don't know I I don't know like my own (27:56 - 28:03)
completely biased view is that they have (28:00 - 28:05)
a lot of crossover between pok√©mon and (28:03 - 28:09)
animal crossing that's probably not true (28:05 - 28:11)
it's just what I see because I have a (28:09 - 28:13)
very limited scope of what's out there (28:11 - 28:15)
but it does seem like the timing was a (28:13 - 28:17)
bit hmm (28:15 - 28:19)
it's it's partially it's a bit of (28:17 - 28:22)
revenge because the last time an animal (28:19 - 28:24)
crossing game came out on a system (28:22 - 28:27)
Pokemon X&Y came out like two months (28:24 - 28:30)
later and everybody was like Animal (28:27 - 28:31)
Crossing whoo (28:30 - 28:34)
oh I don't know her that I did yeah as I (28:31 - 28:37)
got mout what happened to me as well so (28:34 - 28:39)
that's why now Animal Crossing is (28:37 - 28:41)
getting a little micro revenge on (28:39 - 28:42)
Pokemon (28:41 - 28:44)
poor poor pokemon mystery dungeon didn't (28:42 - 28:46)
ask for this fight but it's gotten (28:44 - 28:48)
yanked into it either anyway I don't (28:46 - 28:50)
know the new max rates are hard to (28:48 - 28:53)
resist we got to get a my champ I (28:50 - 28:55)
haven't done the MA champ yet I had I (28:53 - 29:00)
found one but it's isn't it sorta (28:55 - 29:01)
like it will appear in the other it's (29:00 - 29:02)
mostly sword (29:01 - 29:06)
Machamp is five-star only in sword (29:02 - 29:09)
gangers five star only in shield but (29:06 - 29:14)
three and four stars will have both yeah (29:09 - 29:16)
I got a I got a three star my champ in (29:14 - 29:17)
mind the (29:16 - 29:20)
300 of four stars have a 10% chance of (29:17 - 29:22)
appearing and then the five stars have a (29:20 - 29:26)
20% chance of appearing before anyone (29:22 - 29:28)
tweets at me saying that Machamp a gang (29:26 - 29:30)
gar in both games we're talking (29:28 - 29:32)
specifically about promoted race but way (29:30 - 29:34)
I've got the Giganta mechs (29:32 - 29:37)
Gengar multiple times maybe I was on (29:34 - 29:40)
other people's yeah yes so like if I'm (29:37 - 29:43)
playing shield you can I can find gang (29:40 - 29:45)
gars quicker than a sword player can and (29:43 - 29:49)
I can invite you to mine you never do (29:45 - 29:53)
hey that code is usually five five five (29:49 - 29:57)
five five not that's you change it a lot (29:53 - 30:00)
you start your codes with zero we talked (29:57 - 30:02)
about this like I don't start oh yeah (30:00 - 30:06)
well no that's that's like trade codes (30:02 - 30:06)
grade codes for raid codes raids don't (30:07 - 30:12)
matter anyways because most people want (30:10 - 30:14)
everybody between five five five five (30:12 - 30:18)
five and 77077 a lot so don't say it's (30:14 - 30:20)
always cuz I have seen you do well (30:18 - 30:23)
sometimes it's awful yeah so I was like (30:20 - 30:26)
nah don't fall for your lies that you're (30:23 - 30:29)
trying to spread that you can not watch (30:26 - 30:32)
your stream and get into your raids look (30:29 - 30:36)
look let's take a break when we come (30:32 - 30:38)
back well we'll start our questions we (30:36 - 30:40)
get a bunch of questions from all over (30:38 - 30:42)
the internet so we will take a quick (30:40 - 30:45)
break and we will be right back (30:42 - 30:56)
[Music] (30:45 - 30:56)
[Music] (30:58 - 31:01)
alright let's dive into some questions (31:24 - 31:32)
we're not sure I'm ready to handle this (31:28 - 31:36)
let's start off with uh what is your (31:32 - 31:39)
social security number date ah svet Nick (31:36 - 31:43)
24 this is off our subreddit says (31:39 - 31:46)
episode 400 question how have your (31:43 - 31:49)
Pokemon that tastes tastes changed over (31:46 - 31:52)
the 400 episodes for example is there a (31:49 - 31:54)
Pokemon you absolutely hated towards the (31:52 - 31:57)
beginning of time beginning of the time (31:54 - 31:59)
you began that you liked now is there a (31:57 - 32:00)
game that you liked that you never (31:59 - 32:02)
wanted to touch again thanks for all the (32:00 - 32:04)
fun I started listening to you guys when (32:02 - 32:05)
sword and shield were first announced (32:04 - 32:07)
and I've been here every week since (32:05 - 32:10)
Congrats on 400 how have my Pokemon (32:07 - 32:15)
tastes changed hmm the weirdest thing (32:10 - 32:20)
for me is among my favorite Pokemon are (32:15 - 32:24)
fire types like cyndaquil Victini stuff (32:20 - 32:26)
like that but if you were to ask me like (32:24 - 32:28)
my favorite type of pokemon fire type is (32:26 - 32:33)
not like the actual type hmm I like (32:28 - 32:35)
fairy and I like grass and I like bug a (32:33 - 32:36)
lot (32:35 - 32:43)
my fairy bug Pokemon the missing one is (32:36 - 32:46)
there I think I've grown to appreciate (32:43 - 32:50)
far-fetched more because of the podcast (32:46 - 32:54)
I think over time I've begun to hate the (32:50 - 32:58)
mechanical ones more so like I was okay (32:54 - 33:01)
with I didn't think of a lot about them (32:58 - 33:03)
but then once you're sort of on a show (33:01 - 33:04)
and you have to think about them I think (33:03 - 33:06)
my dislike for things like Magnemite and (33:04 - 33:08)
clinking clanging in all of them so (33:06 - 33:10)
how's your I was pretty much the (33:08 - 33:13)
apotheosis of the nadir of Pokemon life (33:10 - 33:16)
for you yep don't like it at least for (33:13 - 33:21)
me over 400 episodes I think you realize (33:16 - 33:24)
how just like your tastes do change over (33:21 - 33:30)
time and there's document documentation (33:24 - 33:30)
it's very true there's people who've (33:30 - 33:34)
been listening for a long time who can (33:32 - 33:36)
pull out some old chestnuts and I'm like (33:34 - 33:37)
actually even people who haven't been (33:36 - 33:39)
listening for a long time but decide to (33:37 - 33:41)
go through that back catalogue and (33:39 - 33:44)
they're like I remembered 30 years ago (33:41 - 33:48)
you said look I don't remember what we (33:44 - 33:50)
said last week so don't worry about 30 (33:48 - 33:53)
years ago I definitely remember early on (33:50 - 33:58)
looking for Pokemon that felt nice like (33:53 - 34:01)
grumpig or even gold duck I think at the (33:58 - 34:03)
time although like I had a pretty good (34:01 - 34:05)
story with gold duck but now I like (34:03 - 34:07)
those let's Pokemon I don't think about (34:05 - 34:09)
as much and it's probably because we (34:07 - 34:12)
have like more Pokemon and more Pokemon (34:09 - 34:15)
that I can that I like significantly (34:12 - 34:17)
more than the grumpy I like I don't get (34:15 - 34:19)
any problems with grumpig but also at (34:17 - 34:20)
the same time no one ever talks about (34:19 - 34:23)
grumpig it's probably like that whole (34:20 - 34:25)
like psychological or social psychology (34:23 - 34:27)
thing where it's like you can only have (34:25 - 34:30)
like eight close friends or something (34:27 - 34:31)
like that (34:30 - 34:32)
and like once you get another close (34:31 - 34:34)
friend one of those other ones gets (34:32 - 34:37)
knocked out of it and it's like you once (34:34 - 34:42)
Crammer and showed up some other there (34:37 - 34:45)
you were wild for Krammer and pretty (34:42 - 34:49)
wild for em right yeah all right (34:45 - 34:52)
I also think like Steve you probably (34:49 - 34:54)
have a very different experience about (34:52 - 34:58)
your changing tastes because you're just (34:54 - 35:00)
younger like four will and I we weren't (34:58 - 35:03)
kids when all of this started we were (35:00 - 35:07)
very true in our 20s so you as you know (35:03 - 35:09)
a kid like that when you become adult (35:07 - 35:11)
going back to those games is a very (35:09 - 35:13)
different experience for you than it is (35:11 - 35:17)
for me because I have very once you get (35:13 - 35:19)
past 20 kids you taste don't change that (35:17 - 35:22)
much they change some but not as wildly (35:19 - 35:24)
as if you were 10 when the games came (35:22 - 35:28)
out and now here you are in your 30s (35:24 - 35:30)
trying to go back to those games because (35:28 - 35:32)
you'll see the flaws that you didn't see (35:30 - 35:35)
as a kid whereas for me I saw the flaws (35:32 - 35:38)
immediately because they weren't my (35:35 - 35:40)
childhood games like I have gotten back (35:38 - 35:42)
to my childhood we came to go why did I (35:40 - 35:44)
like this which is a lot of the five (35:42 - 35:46)
advantageous I thought I thought et on (35:44 - 35:49)
the Atari 2600 was an amazing advantage (35:46 - 35:57)
I was never that dumb I am also younger (35:49 - 36:01)
than you I was a single child I don't (35:57 - 36:03)
think that counts is dumb I think like a (36:01 - 36:06)
game like Pokemon Co has has has done (36:03 - 36:09)
that for specific Pokemon like I don't (36:06 - 36:11)
think a lot of people really (36:09 - 36:14)
particularly cared about what's a good (36:11 - 36:17)
example maybe like China or Zola (36:14 - 36:19)
oh yeah corsola that's a good one too or (36:17 - 36:22)
like Chimecho which is incredibly rare (36:19 - 36:25)
and spawns in the wild and when somebody (36:22 - 36:28)
if somebody saw their first Chimecho (36:25 - 36:29)
that would probably be pretty exciting (36:28 - 36:31)
if oh well unless they're extremely (36:29 - 36:33)
casual and they didn't know how rare (36:31 - 36:37)
Chimecho is but hi me raise his hand (36:33 - 36:39)
yeah check that goes real real real rare (36:37 - 36:41)
Pokemon go and if you catch it fun fact (36:39 - 36:46)
you get 3,000 Stardust instead normal (36:41 - 36:48)
whatever start us you would get does it (36:46 - 36:50)
gives you bonus start us checking to see (36:48 - 36:54)
if I got Chimecho pay the most passive (36:50 - 36:57)
player I think as I've met more people (36:54 - 37:01)
through the podcast like their their (36:57 - 37:02)
favorite Pokemon (37:01 - 37:04)
has raised my opinion of that Pokemon (37:02 - 37:07)
some learning people's favorites has (37:04 - 37:10)
also changed my perspective on them a (37:07 - 37:12)
little like listening to the PAX East (37:10 - 37:16)
West South list is always fascinating (37:12 - 37:19)
and that does change some things that's (37:16 - 37:21)
true that's fun I actually from my (37:19 - 37:23)
involvement in the podcast I just feel (37:21 - 37:26)
like I found out so much more in-depth (37:23 - 37:30)
stuff about individual Pokemon like I (37:26 - 37:37)
always really enjoyed the electric whine (37:30 - 37:40)
mm-hmm but then it's like in like (37:37 - 37:41)
learning about it and researching it and (37:40 - 37:43)
finding out that only the middle (37:41 - 37:46)
evolution ever learns any new moves or (37:43 - 37:48)
anything and like the first evolution (37:46 - 37:51)
and the last evolution can't learn any (37:48 - 37:53)
new moves that looks like fascinating (37:51 - 37:55)
yeah it's really it's really cool (37:53 - 37:57)
makes that Pokemon that much cooler to (37:55 - 38:00)
have that deeper knowledge of how it (37:57 - 38:02)
operates do you guys think that Pokemon (38:00 - 38:04)
will one day allow you to play as an (38:02 - 38:06)
adult protagonist in the series if so (38:04 - 38:08)
what kind of things would you like to (38:06 - 38:12)
see any more mature take on Pokemon I (38:08 - 38:15)
think they already started leaning into (38:12 - 38:18)
this a little bit this is actually a (38:15 - 38:21)
really good question this was from ty on (38:18 - 38:24)
reddit yep so in sword and shield (38:21 - 38:26)
unless I'm terribly mistaken I don't (38:24 - 38:28)
think I am they actually don't mention (38:26 - 38:31)
your age at all which i think is a (38:28 - 38:36)
really good first step in general yeah I (38:31 - 38:39)
I don't think it's any secret and I'm (38:36 - 38:40)
sure the Pokemon company knows better (38:39 - 38:43)
than we do of you know who's buying (38:40 - 38:46)
their game where they're buying their (38:43 - 38:49)
game the age of those players the the (38:46 - 38:50)
background of those players whether (38:49 - 38:52)
they're college students or high school (38:50 - 38:56)
students or you know working adults I'm (38:52 - 38:57)
sure they know all that information that (38:56 - 39:00)
they will probably never release but I'm (38:57 - 39:02)
almost positive they don't mention your (39:00 - 39:04)
age at all I don't think they do (39:02 - 39:06)
I don't remember them I think the main (39:04 - 39:09)
problem with that concept like let's say (39:06 - 39:11)
we had the opportunity to do full (39:09 - 39:14)
character customization and you could (39:11 - 39:15)
set whatever age (39:14 - 39:17)
you wanted your character player (39:15 - 39:20)
character to be in the game the issue (39:17 - 39:25)
with that is kind of impactful on the (39:20 - 39:28)
story because if I were to start the (39:25 - 39:32)
game as a 47 year old why don't I have (39:28 - 39:35)
any Pokemon yeah yeah yeah you know it's (39:32 - 39:38)
like the starting the game as a youth (39:35 - 39:42)
kind of is the impetus for why you're (39:38 - 39:47)
starting a Pokemon journey versus well I (39:42 - 39:51)
guess I never did the Pokemon thing even (39:47 - 39:55)
though my entire world we help pokemon (39:51 - 39:57)
guess I'll get into it now (39:55 - 40:01)
I mean I think they will never I think (39:57 - 40:04)
like Steve said the abstraction will (40:01 - 40:06)
continue like they will probably just (40:04 - 40:10)
drop the age completely and just never (40:06 - 40:13)
mention it I think they might do more (40:10 - 40:15)
with customization so that you'd have a (40:13 - 40:17)
little bit more to look a little younger (40:15 - 40:20)
or a little older if you wanted but I (40:17 - 40:23)
don't think I think in games like this (40:20 - 40:27)
it pays better for them to have that (40:23 - 40:31)
avatar be more general than specific and (40:27 - 40:35)
it allows like them to tell the story (40:31 - 40:37)
that they want to tell without having it (40:35 - 40:39)
to be like well why would an adult (40:37 - 40:42)
listen to these people like why that (40:39 - 40:45)
wouldn't happen and exactly like they do (40:42 - 40:47)
mention that you're younger in sword and (40:45 - 40:51)
shield in the fact that Sonia and Leon (40:47 - 40:53)
are like let the adults handle this a (40:51 - 40:56)
couple of times like they do they do (40:53 - 40:58)
point out that you are younger while not (40:56 - 41:02)
ever stating that you are an exact age (40:58 - 41:05)
it is definitely implied that you are at (41:02 - 41:09)
least pre 18 or whatever they consider (41:05 - 41:10)
an adult (41:09 - 41:12)
I thought pre 18 is probably the best (41:10 - 41:14)
way to put it somewhere probably (41:12 - 41:15)
somewhere between 12 and 18 i thinik (41:14 - 41:18)
this I don't know that we will get (41:15 - 41:22)
anything out of making (41:18 - 41:25)
adult protagonists that isn't already (41:22 - 41:28)
like I don't know that that enhances the (41:25 - 41:30)
game because I think it's a different (41:28 - 41:31)
question than what do you think is and (41:30 - 41:33)
the more maturity cuz I think you can (41:31 - 41:37)
still do more mature and still have a (41:33 - 41:40)
youngish protagonist yeah I mean I I've (41:37 - 41:42)
always said that like a lot of people (41:40 - 41:45)
missed the the story beats of Sun and (41:42 - 41:47)
Moon or ultra sudden ultramoon where (41:45 - 41:50)
that just in case maybe you skipped over (41:47 - 41:52)
because the tutorial was too long in Sun (41:50 - 41:57)
and Moon one of the core parts of the (41:52 - 42:01)
storyline is about verbal abuse between (41:57 - 42:04)
adults and kids specifically with like (42:01 - 42:06)
Lily and Lucy mean and that's as pretty (42:04 - 42:09)
mature as it gets and I've always said (42:06 - 42:11)
that like most adults don't understand (42:09 - 42:16)
verbal abuse yeah more or less like kids (42:11 - 42:19)
understanding it just some trivia here (42:16 - 42:24)
Calum and Serena they never talk about (42:19 - 42:26)
their ages in X&Y yeah I was gonna say (42:24 - 42:27)
it (42:26 - 42:30)
in any of the games which of the games (42:27 - 42:32)
have they specified your age they (42:30 - 42:33)
specify and like red and blue that (42:32 - 42:35)
you're like 10 years old I think and (42:33 - 42:37)
gold and silver they also specify 10 (42:35 - 42:40)
years old in Sun and Moon they actually (42:37 - 42:42)
specify that you're 11 years old we have (42:40 - 42:46)
a Celine and Elio I think their names (42:42 - 42:48)
are and then so they didn't specify age (42:46 - 42:52)
and X&Y and they didn't specify age in (42:48 - 42:55)
sword and shield at least in the video (42:52 - 42:57)
games I don't know they might have in (42:55 - 43:01)
the manga what do we think like more (42:57 - 43:04)
mature take on Pokemon I don't know I (43:01 - 43:06)
think (43:04 - 43:08)
think they can like they started to do (43:06 - 43:10)
more mature storylines and sunny Sunday (43:08 - 43:10)
moon (43:10 - 43:13)
I think they can definitely do that in a (43:10 - 43:17)
more mature take on it I like it have to (43:13 - 43:19)
really be a one-off and then have to be (43:17 - 43:21)
really careful about what they decide to (43:19 - 43:26)
take on part of the charm is for me is (43:21 - 43:29)
that it's somewhat abstracted that (43:26 - 43:31)
there's an abstraction there and it (43:29 - 43:33)
doesn't really ask you to think much (43:31 - 43:37)
deeper than what they're presenting you (43:33 - 43:40)
I think the danger of doing a more (43:37 - 43:43)
mature take on anything is you can (43:40 - 43:45)
unless you're incredibly careful you'll (43:43 - 43:48)
easily make something very problematic (43:45 - 43:53)
and as people have proven it's hard for (43:48 - 43:56)
them to accept new visions and new takes (43:53 - 43:58)
on things without it affecting their (43:56 - 44:01)
previous experiences of it true um so I (43:58 - 44:03)
think they could probably tell deeper (44:01 - 44:05)
stories but I think they should probably (44:03 - 44:08)
limit that to more interpersonal stories (44:05 - 44:10)
like they did in Sun and Moon and they (44:08 - 44:11)
touched a little bit and sword and (44:10 - 44:15)
shield like you know beads entire (44:11 - 44:16)
storyline it's probably one of the best (44:15 - 44:19)
things about Sargent shield and I think (44:16 - 44:21)
they can do more of that and get into (44:19 - 44:23)
that in more depth but I think they (44:21 - 44:26)
would probably want to avoid the weird (44:23 - 44:29)
conversations P people have about your (44:26 - 44:32)
relationship with Pokemon and what that (44:29 - 44:34)
actually looks like I think delving (44:32 - 44:36)
really far into that without being super (44:34 - 44:38)
careful about it is gonna be super (44:36 - 44:40)
problem they already avoid the the hard (44:38 - 44:42)
conversations of like oh we don't know (44:40 - 44:49)
what to do with loose I mean yeah (44:42 - 44:50)
chairman rows just disappeared didn't he (44:49 - 44:53)
yeah so I think there's a couple of (44:50 - 44:57)
issues also with a more mature take (44:53 - 45:01)
right just the concept of that one is a (44:57 - 45:04)
lot of times people take more mature to (45:01 - 45:08)
mean darker Khurram which does not have (45:04 - 45:10)
to be the teh the case it can just mean (45:08 - 45:13)
more complex and introducing more (45:10 - 45:17)
complexity into the story concepts of (45:13 - 45:20)
the game where there's more subplot sub (45:17 - 45:22)
deeper you know characterization and (45:20 - 45:26)
everything but the main issue that I (45:22 - 45:28)
think will always be the biggest hurdle (45:26 - 45:31)
to a quote more mature take on Pokemon (45:28 - 45:35)
is Pokemon is intended to be an all-ages (45:31 - 45:39)
game and once you make it you know Final (45:35 - 45:45)
Fantasy 10 that really takes out a lot (45:39 - 45:49)
of the younger audience right because (45:45 - 45:53)
kids you know from maybe like six years (45:49 - 45:55)
old to eleven years old aren't (45:53 - 45:59)
interested into a troubled romance of (45:55 - 46:02)
separated lovers right which is you know (45:59 - 46:05)
that's a good trope in a mature more (46:02 - 46:08)
mature well I I will never say pokemons (46:05 - 46:09)
a kids game I will always say it's an (46:08 - 46:12)
all-ages games and I think that the (46:09 - 46:15)
intent of the creators of Pokemon is (46:12 - 46:18)
forward to always be an all-ages game (46:15 - 46:22)
and it would take a huge shift in their (46:18 - 46:24)
philosophy to move away from the concept (46:22 - 46:27)
yeah an all-ages game I will say this (46:24 - 46:31)
that I would like and unfortunately (46:27 - 46:33)
people will see this as a more mature (46:31 - 46:36)
take on Pokemon it's not I would like to (46:33 - 46:40)
see a wider variety of relationships (46:36 - 46:43)
represented in my Pokemon games like we (46:40 - 46:46)
are finally starting to get there with (46:43 - 46:49)
skin color diversity it would be nice to (46:46 - 46:52)
have other diversity that is not (46:49 - 46:56)
considered mature but just part of the (46:52 - 47:00)
universe they got Steven and Marlon Wow (46:56 - 47:08)
Oh razor blade here on reddit asks do (47:00 - 47:10)
you think if Pokemon was never made (47:08 - 47:12)
could there be another game that would (47:10 - 47:13)
have created the same impact or (47:12 - 47:17)
impression in your life if so which one (47:13 - 47:20)
Final Fantasy was that game (47:17 - 47:23)
until Pokemon came like AI is a huge (47:20 - 47:26)
huge huge final fantasy fan and I still (47:23 - 47:27)
AM (47:26 - 47:30)
to some extent but not not as much as I (47:27 - 47:32)
am with Pokemon so pokum I never existed (47:30 - 47:35)
then I would have I would be probably in (47:32 - 47:38)
the Final Fantasy podcast that's the (47:35 - 47:39)
deepest and darkest timeline right there (47:38 - 47:43)
yep I mean I've already recorded 15 (47:39 - 47:45)
episodes of Katamari cast and just not (47:43 - 47:49)
released yet I haven't yet how rude look (47:45 - 47:53)
there's a long line of people who want (47:49 - 47:56)
to be on Katamari cast so you know we (47:53 - 47:59)
get your turn I'm one of the cousins you (47:56 - 48:01)
have to unlock they rolling me up I he (47:59 - 48:04)
go for me it probably would have been (48:01 - 48:07)
like a World of Warcraft or another mm (48:04 - 48:09)
oh I don't know whatever no mmo's (48:07 - 48:12)
existed back in the against whatever (48:09 - 48:15)
quest I think was whatever request was (48:12 - 48:16)
that whatever crush was the big one (48:15 - 48:18)
before I mean there are a bunch of small (48:16 - 48:18)
ones (48:18 - 48:21)
yeah like EverQuest was the was it was (48:18 - 48:22)
EverQuest and then Wow happened and (48:21 - 48:24)
there was like ever what that's uh no (48:22 - 48:27)
play why cuz why was fun yeah so I I (48:24 - 48:29)
don't even think that if Pokemon didn't (48:27 - 48:33)
have the transfer from Pokemon to (48:29 - 48:35)
Pokemon from each game I don't think it (48:33 - 48:37)
would have been as impactful as it was (48:35 - 48:39)
on me and an MMO has always kind of had (48:37 - 48:41)
that and that's why I like I was so into (48:39 - 48:44)
destiny and they they kind of ruined (48:41 - 48:47)
that but I put a lot into the first (48:44 - 48:49)
three years of Destiny because I wanted (48:47 - 48:50)
to collect everything because I was sold (48:49 - 48:52)
that this would be like a ten year game (48:50 - 48:55)
and it ended up being a three year game (48:52 - 48:59)
and you got to start over in year four (48:55 - 49:01)
which kind of killed a lot for me and (48:59 - 49:04)
the internet was not very if we're gonna (49:01 - 49:07)
be a destiny three cuz I I know I could (49:04 - 49:10)
get back into it TV now Bungie is (49:07 - 49:16)
working on a game for some big Chinese (49:10 - 49:20)
money that said that game is not destiny (49:16 - 49:26)
[Laughter] (49:20 - 49:30)
in the pockets of big China (49:26 - 49:33)
you can't cuz you're allergic to soy (49:30 - 49:37)
look there are soy alternatives (49:33 - 49:41)
not according to bake China big China or (49:37 - 49:43)
not I am confident that there are people (49:41 - 49:46)
who gave up on Pokemon when the jump (49:43 - 49:48)
from gen 2 to Gen 3 was made there were (49:46 - 49:51)
some definitely yeah yeah (49:48 - 49:55)
but it was necessary I was still stand (49:51 - 49:58)
by Jed 3 is the most important Jen so ok (49:55 - 50:01)
let's let's put it this way thinking of (49:58 - 50:03)
impact on your life (50:01 - 50:06)
what game outside of Pokemon has had the (50:03 - 50:08)
biggest impact on your life (50:06 - 50:12)
Oh Shining Force Shining Force yep (50:08 - 50:18)
absolutely uh so Shining Force was the (50:12 - 50:23)
first when I snuck down to Chicago when (50:18 - 50:26)
my then boyfriend now husband's parents (50:23 - 50:28)
were gone for the weekend and we were (50:26 - 50:30)
looking for something to do that we keep (50:28 - 50:33)
us in inside because going out in public (50:30 - 50:36)
as a couple was a little risky what (50:33 - 50:38)
wasn't a thing during those days it (50:36 - 50:39)
wasn't a thousand risky because he had (50:38 - 50:41)
nosy neighbors and I wasn't supposed to (50:39 - 50:45)
be there we went to Blockbuster and (50:41 - 50:48)
rented a Sega and rented Shining Force (50:45 - 50:53)
and played that game all weekend we (50:48 - 50:55)
didn't leave the house we ordered food (50:53 - 50:57)
in and we just played that game which is (50:55 - 51:00)
it's why my wedding invites were Shining (50:57 - 51:02)
Force things I wouldn't know I wasn't (51:00 - 51:05)
invited I didn't know you then and the (51:02 - 51:08)
one person I sort of knew Steve didn't (51:05 - 51:09)
come (51:08 - 51:16)
how rude but like that game is huge like (51:09 - 51:19)
that game is huge in my life um simply (51:16 - 51:22)
because I have so many positive memories (51:19 - 51:24)
attached to it like that was that is (51:22 - 51:27)
that's like like everybody has us like (51:24 - 51:30)
this is our song that is our game like (51:27 - 51:32)
that is a game we talk about that is a (51:30 - 51:34)
game we played a lot of with that is a (51:32 - 51:38)
game that was a huge bonding thing for (51:34 - 51:41)
my husband and I so like that is a that (51:38 - 51:43)
is a big game in my life but like (51:41 - 51:46)
there's not a lot of them and they (51:43 - 51:47)
didn't they just stopped sending him (51:46 - 51:48)
over here so it didn't have a (51:47 - 51:51)
continuation but I will always put that (51:48 - 51:52)
as an important game in my life that's (51:51 - 51:54)
like probably the most important game in (51:52 - 51:57)
I would probably say for myself (51:54 - 52:01)
obviously Katamari Damacy is it just (51:57 - 52:04)
very much like if you put cut Amar'e (52:01 - 52:05)
Damacy on something (52:04 - 52:07)
you're gonna get will Anderson's money (52:05 - 52:11)
that's more because just the gameplay is (52:07 - 52:15)
so simple but yet still engaging and (52:11 - 52:18)
it's just almost like you know (52:15 - 52:22)
encapsulated joy that you just you go in (52:18 - 52:25)
there the way the music and the graphics (52:22 - 52:27)
and everything comes together you you (52:25 - 52:30)
can't step away unhappy right it just (52:27 - 52:32)
brings happiness into your heart playing (52:30 - 52:35)
Katamari Damacy it's it's silly but you (52:32 - 52:37)
know you listen to that music and you (52:35 - 52:39)
just you know you're rolling that ball (52:37 - 52:42)
you're picking up weird things who even (52:39 - 52:44)
knows why anything's happening that's (52:42 - 52:48)
that I will say that the one game that (52:44 - 52:53)
like for story that I got really (52:48 - 52:56)
engrossed in and just like looked (52:53 - 52:59)
forward to and very unhappy that you (52:56 - 53:02)
can't get it anymore you know that it's (52:59 - 53:04)
not available not pushed forward into (53:02 - 53:08)
systems is everything from the legacy of (53:04 - 53:12)
kain Soul Reaver series just because I (53:08 - 53:17)
just found that that whole like what is (53:12 - 53:20)
it like the environment and the lore and (53:17 - 53:23)
everything of those games which I think (53:20 - 53:24)
there were like five or six of the games (53:23 - 53:27)
I only play her a lot of them I only (53:24 - 53:28)
played like the last three or four of (53:27 - 53:32)
them when they were on like ps1 ps2 with (53:28 - 53:35)
Raziel it's just like it was so gripping (53:32 - 53:40)
for me and that I would like literally (53:35 - 53:43)
like call in sick to work to sit at home (53:40 - 53:46)
and play that game for eight hours just (53:43 - 53:48)
to get through it to see how the story (53:46 - 53:52)
was gonna unfold and you know there (53:48 - 53:56)
wasn't much internet to look at back you (53:52 - 53:58)
know when those games were out but I (53:56 - 53:59)
would look up and I was like what what (53:58 - 54:01)
can I find out about like these other (53:59 - 54:03)
extra dimensional creatures that are (54:01 - 54:06)
involved in like all the twists and the (54:03 - 54:07)
different things that were happening and (54:06 - 54:09)
how different people were being (54:07 - 54:10)
manipulated and it's just like that game (54:09 - 54:13)
like if I could get a master series of (54:10 - 54:17)
that but in saying all of that I was (54:13 - 54:19)
just reminded (54:17 - 54:21)
that I was going through some boxes and (54:19 - 54:24)
I found my mist masterpiece edition Oh (54:21 - 54:30)
miss and that game I can just I can (54:24 - 54:33)
think back to like 1994 and sitting in (54:30 - 54:35)
front of a computer for six hours trying (54:33 - 54:37)
to solve those puzzles I put it in my (54:35 - 54:40)
computer like last week and I can't even (54:37 - 54:42)
play it because the graphics are so bad (54:40 - 54:43)
it doesn't can't even render the (54:42 - 54:45)
graphics but boy oh boy (54:43 - 54:48)
Myst was a game changer and has never (54:45 - 54:51)
been replicated absolutely not again (54:48 - 54:54)
when it comes to lore and just like the (54:51 - 54:55)
simplicity of what it offers but the (54:54 - 54:58)
depth of what it communicates that's (54:55 - 55:00)
there you go all right Steve what's your (54:58 - 55:04)
answer ah destiny we did have a lot of (55:00 - 55:05)
good times with destiny that's true (55:04 - 55:08)
maybe I will say world Warcraft was my (55:05 - 55:11)
first MMO and that that was a game (55:08 - 55:13)
changer as far as what mmo's were hey (55:11 - 55:15)
spj and crew my birthday is coming up (55:13 - 55:17)
March 15th and I wanted to let you guys (55:15 - 55:19)
know that you really helped me get (55:17 - 55:21)
through the day and I appreciate you all (55:19 - 55:23)
I started listening to your podcast last (55:21 - 55:24)
fall when I was getting back into (55:23 - 55:26)
Pokemon after a hiatus of not playing (55:24 - 55:31)
thank you for reading is this a question (55:26 - 55:31)
long thing thank you for reinvigorating (55:33 - 55:38)
my interest in a franchise I loved so (55:36 - 55:41)
dearly I was wondering what your very (55:38 - 55:44)
first shiny pokemon you caught was and (55:41 - 55:46)
what went through your head when you saw (55:44 - 55:49)
that sparkle mine was in a lowland (55:46 - 55:49)
Geodude (55:49 - 55:51)
I remember feeling my heart skip a beat (55:49 - 55:55)
as the excitement set in because it was (55:51 - 55:56)
a complete surprise (55:55 - 55:59)
that's from Aiden I know what mine was (55:56 - 56:03)
you do know yeah what was it (55:59 - 56:08)
so I was playing I want to say it was (56:03 - 56:12)
diamond and I was over in an area that (56:08 - 56:14)
sort of you know that because they have (56:12 - 56:17)
that separate island that you went to (56:14 - 56:22)
and I was traveling through and a lady (56:17 - 56:24)
and popped up and it was shiny and I'm (56:22 - 56:29)
like oh oh really this is my first shiny (56:24 - 56:35)
lady in fine and then I caught it (56:29 - 56:38)
that was my first wild shiny I will say (56:35 - 56:41)
the first shiny that I hunted ever was i (56:38 - 56:45)
bred the shiny Rosalia in emerald but (56:41 - 56:49)
that was like me specifically hunting (56:45 - 56:50)
for that so finally getting it because (56:49 - 56:52)
there were there was no way of (56:50 - 56:54)
manipulating at odds I was like I don't (56:52 - 56:56)
know thousands of eggs in and it finally (56:54 - 56:59)
happened that was just like a relief so (56:56 - 57:01)
it wasn't like I don't really count that (56:59 - 57:03)
as my first shiny because I was (57:01 - 57:06)
specifically trying to get that so my (57:03 - 57:08)
first ever wild encounter was lady and (57:06 - 57:14)
it was like yeah I'm pretty sure I'm not (57:08 - 57:15)
a hundred percent sure but I'm pretty (57:14 - 57:21)
sure my first wild yeah really my first (57:15 - 57:26)
shiny for me was in white - I got a (57:21 - 57:30)
shiny lilipop on that ranch where they (57:26 - 57:33)
had the look the herd ears and the (57:30 - 57:35)
little pups and everything right in this (57:33 - 57:41)
starting part so that I was you know a (57:35 - 57:42)
little excited for it (57:41 - 57:44)
[Music] (57:42 - 57:47)
I think I named it after my dog at the (57:44 - 57:53)
time but probably my most exciting shiny (57:47 - 57:56)
moment was in X&Y when I was in that (57:53 - 57:58)
forest before you get to the where the (57:56 - 58:01)
Mewtwo is like the animal village area (57:58 - 58:05)
you know that forest maze (58:01 - 58:08)
you had to do in X&Y yeah yeah and I (58:05 - 58:11)
came across a trevenant in a horde (58:08 - 58:14)
battle and I was just like it was like (58:11 - 58:17)
so unexpected and so surprising for me (58:14 - 58:19)
and like the way that like the trevenant (58:17 - 58:21)
shiny looks especially when you're in a (58:19 - 58:24)
horse rally and there's like one white (58:21 - 58:28)
one the other dark ones that that that (58:24 - 58:30)
was like probably my most exciting shiny (58:28 - 58:30)
moment (58:30 - 58:34)
way better than ledian steve do you are (58:30 - 58:36)
you even able to feel excitement about (58:34 - 58:40)
chinese anymore oh like an act I've no (58:36 - 58:42)
it's not an act I've come full circle in (58:40 - 58:45)
Chinese from not caring about them sooo (58:42 - 58:47)
caring about them kind of going back to (58:45 - 58:49)
not caring about them I don't have like (58:47 - 58:52)
I think all my all my shiny moments are (58:49 - 58:55)
documented pretty well so how hard is it (58:52 - 59:02)
to get a shiny authentic authentic (58:55 - 59:02)
synesthesia will they have a mark though (59:02 - 59:09)
uh what is it wait what (59:05 - 59:12)
what's the mark marks are ribbons you I (59:09 - 59:18)
know nothing about synesthesia ste I (59:12 - 59:20)
just keep buying pots (59:18 - 59:21)
I still haven't even in care I have on (59:20 - 59:23)
wait is this a genuine question if you (59:21 - 59:26)
don't know what marks are I'm not I (59:23 - 59:28)
don't know what marks are marks are (59:26 - 59:28)
ribbons (59:28 - 59:31)
except you cannot earn them they just (59:28 - 59:33)
appear I'm Pokemon when you catch them (59:31 - 59:36)
how are they the titles yes yeah there's (59:33 - 59:40)
like 25 of them I think (59:36 - 59:40)
search for them in Pokemon home um I (59:40 - 59:44)
don't think you can search by I don't (59:43 - 59:47)
think it ends in home I don't think so I (59:44 - 59:49)
may have a bunch of marks and just not (59:47 - 59:51)
even realize it that's possible yeah you (59:49 - 59:53)
have to Gaja live in and then hit up and (59:51 - 59:55)
down and check them all (59:53 - 59:59)
boy oh boy got a check up mo ah this is (59:55 - 60:01)
for McQueen Hawk loved Maddy on the mood (59:59 - 60:03)
move at this episode probably my (60:01 - 60:08)
favorite segment so far and then brown (60:03 - 60:11)
speckled bear also said this episode was (60:08 - 60:14)
great loved Maddy on the move I liked (60:11 - 60:15)
when you guys got into the weeds about (60:14 - 60:18)
different types of pok√©mon that have (60:15 - 60:21)
been given out in the past including (60:18 - 60:25)
Steve's freak out over pokemon box also (60:21 - 60:27)
if anyone knows I can't get into my (60:25 - 60:29)
Pokemon past anymore has this been (60:27 - 60:31)
killed by the Pokemon company I forgot (60:29 - 60:34)
to claim my shiny so gaily oh uh yeah I (60:31 - 60:35)
don't think Pokemon past works anymore (60:34 - 60:38)
that Pokemon past personally because it (60:35 - 60:39)
wasn't released worldwide this is just (60:38 - 60:41)
my opinion I think it was literally just (60:39 - 60:45)
a testing bed for what Pokemon home will (60:41 - 60:47)
do in the future when it comes to codes (60:45 - 60:50)
and generating stuff (60:47 - 60:52)
although the shiny so gaily Oh shiny (60:50 - 60:55)
Luna thing I think actually expired (60:52 - 60:56)
expired (60:55 - 60:59)
January 15th it mine says new activities (60:56 - 61:07)
coming soon I'm sure that I don't see (60:59 - 61:08)
why they would rely on Pokemon passed (61:07 - 61:11)
since Pokemon home is worldwide yeah and (61:08 - 61:13)
I think they specifically said that it's (61:11 - 61:15)
going to have features that basically (61:13 - 61:17)
replicate what Pokemon past was doing (61:15 - 61:19)
yeah I mean if you go into Pokemon home (61:17 - 61:23)
there's like a mystery gift area (61:19 - 61:25)
yeah mystery gift and then check for (61:23 - 61:28)
local events which Pokemon Paz was doing (61:25 - 61:30)
and then the gift box is where you would (61:28 - 61:32)
see the past things you've redeemed (61:30 - 61:35)
before so I'm assuming if they do (61:32 - 61:37)
another target event you walk in you (61:35 - 61:39)
open Pokemon home you go to local event (61:37 - 61:43)
check it checks your GPS and does does (61:39 - 61:46)
the thing it does this is from Dirk off (61:43 - 61:49)
our off our youtube comments if you (61:46 - 61:51)
could have a new app record ball and (61:49 - 61:53)
sword and shield but what would it do a (61:51 - 61:57)
slash look like oh boy (61:53 - 61:58)
Hey (61:57 - 62:00)
[Applause] (61:58 - 62:02)
I try to remember what ones we already (62:00 - 62:05)
have dive bar a ball lower ball well (62:02 - 62:07)
that Mazda Abercorn I think there's well (62:05 - 62:08)
I think there needs to be a rework to (62:07 - 62:11)
some of the balls being dipolar ball are (62:08 - 62:13)
like very similar like lower ball (62:11 - 62:15)
specifically works if you're fishing but (62:13 - 62:17)
dive ball specifically works when you're (62:15 - 62:22)
like on water or fishing which is but (62:17 - 62:27)
there's like three balls for water types (62:22 - 62:27)
a bug so let's see we got level ball (62:28 - 62:35)
friend ball lure ball moon ball heavy (62:33 - 62:39)
ball fastball and love ball and love (62:35 - 62:40)
ball works when you're like catching of (62:39 - 62:44)
opposite-gender right oh yeah of your (62:40 - 62:46)
own fastball fastball is based on their (62:44 - 62:49)
speed right like the faster they are the (62:46 - 62:53)
more accurate it is I think so level (62:49 - 62:56)
balls heavy ball yeah which doesn't work (62:53 - 62:57)
on gigantic max Pokemon because they (62:56 - 63:00)
don't wait I mean it can work it was (62:57 - 63:01)
playing with it Paul (63:00 - 63:05)
using a moonstone yep that's like real (63:01 - 63:08)
psyllium so lure ball is catching (63:05 - 63:13)
fishing line easier mm-hmm but netball (63:08 - 63:14)
applies the whole water pokemon right (63:13 - 63:18)
friend ball just makes them friendlier (63:14 - 63:21)
and love of all is what level of their (63:18 - 63:23)
lower level than you right it increases (63:21 - 63:27)
the catch rate by how high your level is (63:23 - 63:29)
higher level you are from them the (63:27 - 63:31)
better the catch rate is a well it's the (63:29 - 63:33)
difference between your levels yes so (63:31 - 63:37)
that's so I would make I would make the (63:33 - 63:40)
diamond ball that makes catching things (63:37 - 63:42)
that evolve using a shiny stone easier (63:40 - 63:45)
it'd be yeah why is there a moon ball (63:42 - 63:48)
yeah it's why is that yeah that's wild (63:45 - 63:51)
but yeah so let's I would go with (63:48 - 63:56)
diamond ball I have half of the (63:51 - 64:00)
evolution stones and just give me like a (63:56 - 64:03)
sin oh stoner you know of a stone no we (64:00 - 64:05)
already got rid of the mossy rock in the (64:03 - 64:07)
icy Rock yeah taking away the whole (64:05 - 64:09)
challenge of this game man every day (64:07 - 64:14)
every day I'm over there at Stonehenge (64:09 - 64:16)
grubbing in the ground to see what kind (64:14 - 64:22)
of rock is my life I'm like is the ebee (64:16 - 64:23)
that I need there (64:22 - 64:25)
no not s beyond today alright let me (64:23 - 64:28)
kill that bugger okay now I'm gonna go (64:25 - 64:31)
ground grass Krauts for rocks at (64:28 - 64:34)
Stonehenge on an unrelated note I do (64:31 - 64:37)
like how they give you a limited amount (64:34 - 64:39)
of appra corn balls because it does (64:37 - 64:43)
encourage you to breed and trade yeah (64:39 - 64:45)
umm which is nice I don't know if you (64:43 - 64:48)
know I know before anyone goes well like (64:45 - 64:50)
the deals little C says we'll get more (64:48 - 64:53)
APRA corn balls sure there's also a way (64:50 - 64:56)
to get more a pecan balls now and it's (64:53 - 64:59)
through the champion Cup and good luck (64:56 - 65:01)
because I've known people who have done (64:59 - 65:04)
30 40 50 champion cup battles in a day (65:01 - 65:07)
and haven't gotten a single one is they (65:04 - 65:09)
did say there's gonna be a way to get a (65:07 - 65:11)
pro corn balls it could be incredibly (65:09 - 65:13)
easy or it could be incredibly tedious (65:11 - 65:14)
like the champion Cup we don't actually (65:13 - 65:19)
know but I do like the limited ecosystem (65:14 - 65:23)
of they're giving you a reason to trade (65:19 - 65:25)
because I don't think there's a lot of (65:23 - 65:27)
good reasons to trade right now like oh (65:25 - 65:30)
I already have a liquid tongue why do I (65:27 - 65:32)
need your lookit tongue butt (65:30 - 65:34)
I don't have a looking to Alec a tongue (65:32 - 65:37)
in a friend ball so I would gladly take (65:34 - 65:39)
that from you I'm surprised there's not (65:37 - 65:41)
pokeballs based off weather conditions (65:39 - 65:43)
like this one works in the rain this one (65:41 - 65:45)
works in the snow this one works in the (65:43 - 65:48)
same storm and yeah why don't we have a (65:45 - 65:51)
dawn ball to go along with the desk ball (65:48 - 65:53)
dusk ball works at night can I get (65:51 - 65:56)
something to work in the day y'all is so (65:53 - 65:57)
y'all need to pick which one are you (65:56 - 65:59)
making I already picked my ball you're (65:57 - 66:00)
all talk about what we're missing which (65:59 - 66:03)
one are you adding I would add a poke (66:00 - 66:08)
ball that works in the snow a snow ball (66:03 - 66:08)
I am gonna make a ball that works only (66:10 - 66:23)
on water pokemon that are actually fish (66:18 - 66:27)
[Laughter] (66:23 - 66:32)
no amphibians nothing that's like a boat (66:27 - 66:37)
add you know only Golden's though they (66:32 - 66:42)
Ximena curse and Brooks Isha's Dreyer CC (66:37 - 66:45)
King um you know I think I would go with (66:42 - 66:48)
the dawn ball I like balance right I (66:45 - 66:49)
like balance my if they're gonna be a (66:48 - 66:52)
dusk ball I want to do one ball right if (66:49 - 66:53)
there's gonna be a heavy ball I want a (66:52 - 66:56)
light ball there's a light bulb Pikachu (66:53 - 67:00)
can hold it it makes him aware (66:56 - 67:00)
boy editor needed to go back and make (67:01 - 67:06)
some adjustments on that yet good I like (67:03 - 67:09)
this one which game Pokemon or not gives (67:06 - 67:11)
you the most nostalgia or remind you of (67:09 - 67:13)
your childhood that was from Stephanie (67:11 - 67:18)
on YouTube space invaders my child yeah (67:13 - 67:21)
boy space invaders was huge they played (67:18 - 67:25)
that game a lot in the old arcade yeah (67:21 - 67:27)
centipede probably for me centipede (67:25 - 67:31)
actually had a book on like strategies (67:27 - 67:35)
for me I had a book and strategies for (67:31 - 67:37)
centipede I had a book and strategies (67:35 - 67:43)
for asteroids asteroids I could not play (67:37 - 67:45)
I did the physics in that game yeah the (67:43 - 67:48)
physics in the yard my narrow (67:45 - 67:51)
unforgiving I won game that I just like (67:48 - 67:53)
I was obsessed with and I just could not (67:51 - 67:55)
play Robotron I actually had a book I'm (67:53 - 67:58)
like a robot Ron hated it cuz I couldn't (67:55 - 68:00)
play it because the two joysticks were (67:58 - 68:03)
what I'm one was always broken well but (68:00 - 68:05)
the thing is like Robotron had such (68:03 - 68:10)
depth of story for ya I mean for the (68:05 - 68:12)
arcade game that it was at a chunk (68:10 - 68:15)
you've gotta save your family from (68:12 - 68:20)
becoming mutants it was dark I will say (68:15 - 68:22)
the other one that's really big Dragon's (68:20 - 68:24)
Lair my brother and I played a lot and (68:22 - 68:27)
we would act out the levels at home to (68:24 - 68:29)
try to figure out to get the timing down (68:27 - 68:31)
to do them right so you get the end so I (68:29 - 68:33)
have a fondness for Dragon's Lair only (68:31 - 68:35)
as a connection to my brother (68:33 - 68:37)
but thanks player was the one that was (68:35 - 68:38)
kind of animated yeah it was the (68:37 - 68:40)
animated one could never get past the (68:38 - 68:41)
first level (68:40 - 68:44)
I like Space Ace better but Dragon's (68:41 - 68:46)
Lair was the first my brother and I (68:44 - 68:48)
planted a lot at the skating rink you (68:46 - 68:51)
know but in middle school I used to play (68:48 - 68:56)
I think it was jump man I'm not 100% (68:51 - 68:57)
sure if that was the name of it because (68:56 - 68:59)
there's a couple of games that are very (68:57 - 69:01)
similarly named but it was literally it (68:59 - 69:03)
was like like almost like a mario clone (69:01 - 69:05)
you're just on Platteville IMing up and (69:03 - 69:07)
down and then jumping to collect rings (69:05 - 69:09)
and you had to collect all the Rings in (69:07 - 69:12)
the level to complete the level man I (69:09 - 69:13)
would obsess (69:12 - 69:16)
on that game I was a huge fan of Donkey (69:13 - 69:20)
Kong jr. I my first game that I (69:16 - 69:24)
collected actual things for was pac-man (69:20 - 69:25)
like I had peckmon sheets I had a (69:24 - 69:27)
pac-man book and a pac-man arcade (69:25 - 69:31)
machine like man you had pac-man fever (69:27 - 69:33)
okay yeah I couldn't help them (69:31 - 69:36)
I had that of them that I listened to it (69:33 - 69:37)
a lot (69:36 - 69:39)
all right so eighties time is over see (69:37 - 69:42)
what's yours how can I compete with v's (69:39 - 69:46)
though you can't but try probably Sonic (69:42 - 69:51)
the Hedgehog 2 & 3 uh and gotta invest (69:46 - 69:54)
probably wrists are for the games that (69:51 - 69:57)
was a lot of my younger childhood that (69:54 - 70:01)
wasn't Pokemon wrists star yeah it was (69:57 - 70:05)
made by it was a Sega Genesis game I can (70:01 - 70:07)
confirm the name of the game was jump (70:05 - 70:08)
man (70:07 - 70:12)
excellent oh wait I know wrists are I do (70:08 - 70:14)
know that game all right (70:12 - 70:18)
sta oh right yes yeah it was developed (70:14 - 70:20)
and published by Sega (70:18 - 70:22)
I can't remember it there's a the people (70:20 - 70:24)
who made it made like some other popular (70:22 - 70:27)
games too but I probably played that (70:24 - 70:29)
game a million times because I like if (70:27 - 70:34)
there's no wrists are cast nope no no (70:29 - 70:38)
real star cast at all no deep lore about (70:34 - 70:41)
a game series that's no longer made I'm (70:38 - 70:42)
gonna be silent for the rest of the (70:41 - 70:44)
episode as I watched youtube videos of (70:42 - 70:47)
Jumpman bankers it's nice knowing y'all (70:44 - 70:51)
are there any jump man speedruns it's (70:47 - 70:58)
all speedruns dude I will do one more (70:51 - 71:00)
question before I break this is from (70:58 - 71:03)
Stev should I get Animal Crossing no yes (71:00 - 71:06)
I don't know I haven't decided it don't (71:03 - 71:09)
ask me these things what you want out of (71:06 - 71:11)
life I mean should you learn to play (71:09 - 71:14)
guitar should you take up knitting (71:11 - 71:21)
should you lift heavy I mean maybe I (71:14 - 71:24)
okay I will say this as in most animal (71:21 - 71:27)
crossing games if you are on the fence (71:24 - 71:31)
at all buy it within the first week or (71:27 - 71:33)
so when everybody's still really active (71:31 - 71:35)
and you can go visit everybody's towns (71:33 - 71:37)
about a month later when everybody's (71:35 - 71:40)
really upset about the fact that you (71:37 - 71:42)
know checking every day all the casuals (71:40 - 71:44)
are gone and all the hardcore players (71:42 - 71:46)
are there and those people are wild so (71:44 - 71:49)
get in early and get out early if you're (71:46 - 71:51)
gonna do it yeah I would agree with that (71:49 - 71:52)
if you're gonna pull the trigger you (71:51 - 71:55)
better pull it on day one day what are (71:52 - 71:57)
at least week one while people are still (71:55 - 72:00)
really jazzed about it if you're friends (71:57 - 72:02)
with Nick in Canada you can buy it any (72:00 - 72:06)
time because he will take your town (72:02 - 72:09)
under his wing and turn it into a (72:06 - 72:11)
glorious Empire I'm not friends with (72:09 - 72:15)
Nick in Canada though so well I mean (72:11 - 72:17)
that's that's what's holding you back I (72:15 - 72:20)
know I need to go to Canada as well (72:17 - 72:23)
why start now I'm just not going to (72:20 - 72:25)
we'll take a break when come back we (72:23 - 72:28)
have some more questions to get through (72:25 - 72:32)
so we will be right back (72:28 - 72:32)
[Music] (72:32 - 72:44)
do you really want to suffer through (72:46 - 72:52)
this yes (72:48 - 72:52)
[Music] (72:55 - 73:08)
[Music] (73:12 - 73:16)
all right this is from monster off (73:16 - 73:23)
YouTube hey Pokemon podcast I found the (73:19 - 73:26)
podcast long time ago around episode 150 (73:23 - 73:29)
or so but unfortunately I stopped (73:26 - 73:31)
listening for a really long time when I (73:29 - 73:32)
still found you guys are still doing (73:31 - 73:34)
podcasts I immediately searched on (73:32 - 73:35)
Spotify and not for the past two months (73:34 - 73:38)
months I've been listening every week so (73:35 - 73:39)
glad to find you guys again with all (73:38 - 73:41)
those years you really hope be you (73:39 - 73:43)
really helped me cope with my passing of (73:41 - 73:45)
my great-grandmother at a time I have (73:43 - 73:47)
many questions I could ask but I feel (73:45 - 73:48)
this is the most fitting what is your (73:47 - 73:51)
favorite Pokemon and why love hearing (73:48 - 73:53)
your responses I love you guys keep up (73:51 - 73:54)
the good work (73:53 - 73:57)
probably documented illicits changed - (73:54 - 74:01)
cram rant and what I'm whole time will (73:57 - 74:05)
and why and why hey don't ask questions (74:01 - 74:08)
you don't want answers for I want an (74:05 - 74:09)
answer (74:08 - 74:12)
oh yeah it's part of the question the (74:09 - 74:14)
dirtiness of chroma rant I think it's (74:12 - 74:19)
really cute and really fun to look at I (74:14 - 74:22)
think it's just a fun design overall do (74:19 - 74:25)
you like cute pokemon or cool a pokemon (74:22 - 74:31)
all of the world divided or cool cute (74:25 - 74:33)
and cute cool I mean (74:31 - 74:36)
- well document I love the entire (74:33 - 74:39)
Rosalia line Rosalia is probably my (74:36 - 74:41)
favorite although I'm very partial to (74:39 - 74:43)
rosebud you can actually use it in the (74:41 - 74:46)
game for to do things it the design to (74:43 - 74:50)
me is just like it's super cute also I (74:46 - 74:52)
like a lot of the thought that but (74:50 - 74:55)
behind it I think is really I think it's (74:52 - 74:57)
a really interesting take on a plant (74:55 - 74:59)
coming to life along the lines of oddish (74:57 - 75:02)
is like another type of awe dishes of (74:59 - 75:05)
rose plant coming to life I use it to (75:02 - 75:08)
defeat the battle tower in Colosseum (75:05 - 75:11)
like I've had a strong attachment to (75:08 - 75:14)
that Pokemon ever since I first taught (75:11 - 75:18)
in Ruby and Sapphire and it's just it's (75:14 - 75:22)
cute it's tiny its powerful like it hits (75:18 - 75:24)
all the boxes that I like (75:22 - 75:25)
and I think it's really well design my (75:24 - 75:28)
favorite Pokemon just changes too much (75:25 - 75:31)
I mean cyndaquil is like an always there (75:28 - 75:36)
because my you know when I my first (75:31 - 75:37)
Pokemon game was yellow so I didn't get (75:36 - 75:41)
to pick a starter so when I got pokemon (75:37 - 75:44)
gold and I got to pick a starter that's (75:41 - 75:46)
when I picked cyndaquil because the (75:44 - 75:49)
other starters are hot garbage coal (75:46 - 75:55)
wreck but man it's just like it if I was (75:49 - 75:58)
gonna get a tattoo of a Pokemon I think (75:55 - 76:01)
I'd really get a Victini like a really (75:58 - 76:05)
like well drawn good like realistic art (76:01 - 76:08)
Victini I think would be that spot for (76:05 - 76:10)
me just because I'd like I really (76:08 - 76:14)
appreciate what Victini represents and (76:10 - 76:17)
it like I like to like be reminded of (76:14 - 76:19)
like that positive thinking that comes (76:17 - 76:21)
behind Victini that's probably gonna be (76:19 - 76:23)
the one that like sticks with me for a (76:21 - 76:25)
really long time (76:23 - 76:29)

and said no perfect self dude (77:18 - 77:31)
[Laughter] (77:27 - 77:34)
Dakota says hey new to the podcast Mike (77:31 - 77:37)
new to the podcast hot quest odd quest (77:34 - 77:40)
my question is how does everyone's (77:37 - 77:43)
schedule end up working asking for my (77:40 - 77:46)
own contemplation like how do we make (77:43 - 77:50)
recording this work ah yeah I mean I (77:46 - 77:52)
guess I mean (77:50 - 77:55)
you guys have it easy yeah yeah I mean (77:52 - 77:58)
excuse I mean I do specifically set (77:55 - 78:01)
aside time like Sundays are around the (77:58 - 78:03)
time that we schedule are just always a (78:01 - 78:06)
no like I have something to do um if (78:03 - 78:07)
it's unavoidable then we'll talk about (78:06 - 78:10)
when we can schedule it but it isn't I (78:07 - 78:12)
think it isn't easy like it is a (78:10 - 78:14)
priority that is on my calendar to say (78:12 - 78:18)
no I this time is blocked off and I have (78:14 - 78:20)
changed my shopping patterns and eating (78:18 - 78:23)
patterns to adjust accordingly we have (78:20 - 78:28)
over the past seven and a half years (78:23 - 78:30)
that I've been doing this program (78:28 - 78:35)
migrated the day that we record this (78:30 - 78:40)
program so frequently (78:35 - 78:40)
yeah I mean you you you just like try (78:42 - 78:48)
try to sit down day time but also have (78:45 - 78:50)
the flexibility understanding that (78:48 - 78:53)
things happen in people's lives that we (78:50 - 78:58)
have to you know accommodate for and I (78:53 - 79:00)
mean the the biggest driving factor is (78:58 - 79:02)
obviously Steve wants to be able to (79:00 - 79:07)
stream Monday through Saturday and I (79:02 - 79:09)
think what a lot of people don't (79:07 - 79:13)
understand is editing a podcast does (79:09 - 79:18)
take a lot of time and focus and like (79:13 - 79:19)
that's not just the recording part (79:18 - 79:22)
that's listening back making sure the (79:19 - 79:23)
audio quality is top-notch and I hope (79:22 - 79:25)
everyone appreciates the amount of work (79:23 - 79:27)
that Steve goes puts into making like (79:25 - 79:29)
really good sounding audio because you (79:27 - 79:31)
can I mean if you want me to point you (79:29 - 79:33)
to some really bad sounding podcasts out (79:31 - 79:35)
there so you can learn to appreciate (79:33 - 79:36)
what you're getting in your ears right (79:35 - 79:40)
now I've got a list but yeah even cuz I (79:36 - 79:43)
edit my own podcasts and you know just (79:40 - 79:45)
the time and effort to try to make sure (79:43 - 79:47)
that they sound good it's it's a lot (79:45 - 79:51)
it's on that's why I do it so you don't (79:47 - 79:53)
want to be doing that on a day you know (79:51 - 79:55)
that you're also required to be (79:53 - 79:59)
streaming required for four or five (79:55 - 80:03)
hours also and and I don't know like if (79:59 - 80:06)
Steve and Greg feel the same way one of (80:03 - 80:09)
the other hard things is it's almost (80:06 - 80:14)
like you don't get a day off from work (80:09 - 80:17)
at all because like for me I work Monday (80:14 - 80:20)
to Friday and then Saturday is when I (80:17 - 80:23)
edit the card fight Vanguard podcast (80:20 - 80:26)
that I do right so that's like I have to (80:23 - 80:28)
do that on Saturday I want to keep to a (80:26 - 80:30)
schedule where I am releasing that (80:28 - 80:33)
podcast on Saturdays so like for me (80:30 - 80:35)
Saturday is a work day and then Sunday (80:33 - 80:37)
when we record this it's like I my (80:35 - 80:39)
Sunday is organized around recording (80:37 - 80:41)
this program I mean I do it because I (80:39 - 80:45)
like to do it right I enjoy the feedback (80:41 - 80:47)
that I get from people that they like (80:45 - 80:49)
hearing the things that we have to say (80:47 - 80:51)
that we you know make them laugh make (80:49 - 80:53)
them happy and everything I was like (80:51 - 80:54)
that there's value in that but it's (80:53 - 80:56)
comes (80:54 - 80:57)
of the amount of work that we put into (80:56 - 81:02)
it we made it a priority yes I just have (80:57 - 81:04)
to make like I also work Monday through (81:02 - 81:08)
Friday I record Tuesday nights I have (81:04 - 81:10)
set events where I have to see people (81:08 - 81:13)
like as an adult I've always had this (81:10 - 81:15)
like like Wednesday's are off-limits (81:13 - 81:18)
because that's when I go see a certain (81:15 - 81:20)
group of friends we've all agreed as (81:18 - 81:22)
adults this is the time that we're gonna (81:20 - 81:23)
see each other because if you don't (81:22 - 81:26)
schedule a time you don't it's so easy (81:23 - 81:31)
to lose track of well I'm super tired or (81:26 - 81:33)
you know I've got this coming on or I (81:31 - 81:35)
have this free time so I'm gonna go get (81:33 - 81:36)
this project like it's really easy as an (81:35 - 81:40)
adult to if you don't make time for it (81:36 - 81:43)
tell just let it go by because there's (81:40 - 81:45)
so many different things pulling your (81:43 - 81:47)
attention so like I have a very like (81:45 - 81:50)
people oh I have set schedule of when I (81:47 - 81:51)
see people for certain things like (81:50 - 81:55)
Thursday night magic recorded Tuesdays I (81:51 - 81:59)
Saturday mornings I do work on the game (81:55 - 82:00)
that I put out and getting that out like (81:59 - 82:03)
I have to schedule these things so hey I (82:00 - 82:05)
don't get overwhelmed but B they don't (82:03 - 82:08)
just disappear yeah I mean I'm living in (82:05 - 82:15)
a no day off cycle which is is you know (82:08 - 82:17)
what I signed up for I kind of thought (82:15 - 82:19)
about that a little bit more cuz my dad (82:17 - 82:21)
I was talking to my dad the other day (82:19 - 82:23)
and he was like he's like I don't (82:21 - 82:25)
understand why you you keep doing this (82:23 - 82:28)
like you don't have a day off is it (82:25 - 82:30)
really worth the money you're making and (82:28 - 82:32)
I guess you could easily ask that (82:30 - 82:34)
question to like an actor or an actress (82:32 - 82:38)
or a wrestler or a musician I'm sure (82:34 - 82:42)
somebody who is touring the world I'm (82:38 - 82:45)
sure that's very hard on them yep I left (82:42 - 82:47)
acting for that very reason I left (82:45 - 82:50)
acting because you when when you did get (82:47 - 82:51)
a day off it meant you weren't getting (82:50 - 82:54)
paid anything like it's an incredibly (82:51 - 82:56)
hard life and I decided that that wasn't (82:54 - 82:57)
worth it (82:56 - 82:59)
hey hey find a job you love and you'll (82:57 - 83:08)
never work a day garbage advice it is (82:59 - 83:10)
you you are so right (83:08 - 83:12)
basically here's what the truth is find (83:10 - 83:14)
a job that you love and in five years (83:12 - 83:19)
you'll hate it and I'm even even if it (83:14 - 83:21)
wasn't the hours or the stuff for work (83:19 - 83:23)
it's even going back to the wrestler (83:21 - 83:25)
analogy I mean those those wrestlers are (83:23 - 83:27)
probably not seeing their kids a whole (83:25 - 83:29)
lot since they're on the road and with (83:27 - 83:31)
me like I don't get to see Irene a whole (83:29 - 83:33)
lot like she gets off work at 5:00 I (83:31 - 83:36)
start streaming at usually 6:00 and by (83:33 - 83:37)
the time I'm done she's sleeping and (83:36 - 83:39)
it's just like kind of the sacrifice (83:37 - 83:42)
I've made to create content and the (83:39 - 83:44)
problem with creating content is it's (83:42 - 83:47)
extremely competitive there's no secret (83:44 - 83:49)
that content creator is the number one (83:47 - 83:53)
job that kids want to be and what they (83:49 - 83:55)
write on their little homework sheets (83:53 - 83:57)
when the teacher asks like what do you (83:55 - 83:59)
want to be when you grow up you know it (83:57 - 84:00)
used to be astronaut it used to be I (83:59 - 84:03)
want to be a fire person yeah fire (84:00 - 84:07)
president or astronaut or racecar driver (84:03 - 84:10)
like it is content creator it's youtuber (84:07 - 84:13)
pop whatever my schedule is usually (84:10 - 84:15)
Monday through Friday 6:00 to midnight (84:13 - 84:20)
so that's 30 hours streaming and then on (84:15 - 84:22)
Saturday I only stream for about 4 hours (84:20 - 84:24)
so we're about thirty four hours (84:22 - 84:26)
streaming and then Sunday which is (84:24 - 84:28)
quote-unquote my day off for podcasting (84:26 - 84:31)
it is we record the show which usually (84:28 - 84:33)
takes three to four hours and then it's (84:31 - 84:35)
another three to four hours to edit it (84:33 - 84:38)
and then afterwards it skewing it up for (84:35 - 84:40)
posting you know getting it uploaded (84:38 - 84:42)
getting it ready for YouTube now getting (84:40 - 84:46)
it ready for social media and so my my (84:42 - 84:47)
Sundays are like a full eight hour (84:46 - 84:52)
sometimes 10 hour day and then on top of (84:47 - 84:55)
that now I have to I don't know the word (84:52 - 84:58)
for it is like advertise or get my name (84:55 - 85:01)
out there and making content that people (84:58 - 85:04)
would want to share or enjoy or like or (85:01 - 85:08)
favorite all these buzz words but I've (85:04 - 85:10)
really stepped up my Instagram game (85:08 - 85:11)
besides (85:10 - 85:12)
putting the podcast on YouTube now (85:11 - 85:15)
there's two new YouTube videos that come (85:12 - 85:17)
out on Monday or Wednesday and Friday (85:15 - 85:20)
because the problem is if you slow down (85:17 - 85:25)
on making content you slowly start to (85:20 - 85:28)
become irrelevant and a good analogy of (85:25 - 85:30)
this would be you know something like a (85:28 - 85:33)
Sears or Kmart you know at one point (85:30 - 85:36)
they were very popular household name (85:33 - 85:38)
companies that you know you just say if (85:36 - 85:40)
I need a refrigerator I'm gonna go to (85:38 - 85:42)
Sears if I need pencils for the school (85:40 - 85:44)
year I'm gonna go to Kmart and you know (85:42 - 85:48)
they didn't adapt and evolve another (85:44 - 85:49)
good analogy would like be like (85:48 - 85:54)
Blockbuster and they closed down so it's (85:49 - 85:56)
it's as easy as a content creator to (85:54 - 85:58)
kind of fall in that same path of like (85:56 - 86:02)
if I just continue doing the same old (85:58 - 86:06)
stuff I run the risk of becoming (86:02 - 86:10)
irrelevant or having other content (86:06 - 86:14)
creators take take that spot and it's (86:10 - 86:16)
just how it is so that's probably why (86:14 - 86:18)
the podcast has like slightly changed (86:16 - 86:22)
over the years in a way oh we've changed (86:18 - 86:25)
a lot over these trusts I've been here (86:22 - 86:27)
for a front row seat we've changed a lot (86:25 - 86:30)
we've learned a lot it's why I always (86:27 - 86:32)
try new things on this twitch stream (86:30 - 86:36)
it's why I am now you know doing stuff (86:32 - 86:39)
outside of that and at the end of the (86:36 - 86:41)
day I going back to my dad's like why (86:39 - 86:43)
don't you just get a traditional job (86:41 - 86:45)
which is probably the easy answer of (86:43 - 86:47)
like I could easily make more money (86:45 - 86:49)
once I get work off work at 5:00 p.m. (86:47 - 86:51)
I'm done I don't have to worry about you (86:49 - 86:53)
know did this tweet get enough retweets (86:51 - 86:56)
did this Instagram post get enough likes (86:53 - 86:57)
I don't wouldn't have to worry about (86:56 - 86:59)
that at the end of the day I just like (86:57 - 87:01)
doing this I like being a constant in (86:59 - 87:04)
people's life like there's nothing more (87:01 - 87:07)
exciting than waking up on Monday and (87:04 - 87:09)
seeing people say positive things about (87:07 - 87:10)
the episode if they've already listened (87:09 - 87:13)
to it there's nothing like hitting go (87:10 - 87:17)
live on Monday evening and having people (87:13 - 87:19)
tell me about their weekends and just (87:17 - 87:21)
like reading all these comments this (87:19 - 87:23)
week whether it was on YouTube or slack (87:21 - 87:24)
or (87:23 - 87:27)
reddit or Twitter or whatever is is like (87:24 - 87:29)
worth it enough for me to have these (87:27 - 87:32)
really long work weeks time and time (87:29 - 87:34)
again to answer your question I don't (87:32 - 87:37)
have a day off effort that's not true (87:34 - 87:40)
your you you take vacations and then (87:37 - 87:42)
Greg and I go in and examine the Malheur (87:40 - 87:43)
yep (87:42 - 87:45)
that's yeah that's true that you have we (87:43 - 87:48)
are there to help like take your (87:45 - 87:49)
vacations like it is important like I (87:48 - 87:52)
wanna stress for people who the mental (87:49 - 87:54)
health and well-being of your favorite (87:52 - 87:57)
streamer is affected by their non-stop (87:54 - 88:02)
workload so be aware that when they take (87:57 - 88:05)
a vacation like it is vital for them to (88:02 - 88:08)
continue making content for you to enjoy (88:05 - 88:11)
and not slowly descend into very dark (88:08 - 88:14)
places as a lot of content creators have (88:11 - 88:18)
it's a hard line it's a hard job and (88:14 - 88:23)
they do need those times off you guys (88:18 - 88:25)
want to take a question here I'll ask (88:23 - 88:29)
from Layton hey s PJ and the rest of the (88:25 - 88:30)
podcast family is running if we didn't (88:29 - 88:33)
currently have DLC coming for a third (88:30 - 88:34)
pillar in the sword shield error would (88:33 - 88:37)
you prefer an enhanced game like emerald (88:34 - 88:39)
and platinum or a sequel like black 2 (88:37 - 88:43)
and white 2 sequel enhanced I loved (88:39 - 88:45)
flatten em I loved emerald I liked the (88:43 - 88:47)
enhanced versions more than the sequels (88:45 - 88:54)
but Steve pack ah yeah I would probably (88:47 - 88:57)
say sequel I I enjoyed black to white to (88:54 - 89:01)
a lot marketing I think black to white (88:57 - 89:03)
to still gives you a reason to buy black (89:01 - 89:04)
and white I feel like if you skipped (89:03 - 89:06)
black diamond and pearl (89:04 - 89:09)
you bought platinum boy there's not a (89:06 - 89:10)
lot of reasons to go back to diamond and (89:09 - 89:13)
pearl unless you see that learning bar I (89:10 - 89:16)
do not care about the profits another (89:13 - 89:19)
company I care about my enjoyment with (89:16 - 89:21)
the product yeah I guess I would never (89:19 - 89:22)
tell somebody to buy Sun and Moon at (89:21 - 89:24)
this point because I just think ultra (89:22 - 89:26)
Sun alternate a better product very true (89:24 - 89:29)
i well I still tell be able to buy (89:26 - 89:31)
sudden moon because I think the story is (89:29 - 89:33)
more complex than Sun and Moon (89:31 - 89:38)
yeah and playing both like I think (89:33 - 89:40)
to get more out of the story of (89:38 - 89:42)
ultrasound ultramoon it's important to a (89:40 - 89:44)
played sun and moon so you can see the (89:42 - 89:47)
differences and see how how what they're (89:44 - 89:50)
doing differs like i think of all the (89:47 - 89:53)
ones I've done like send a moon has a (89:50 - 89:55)
much better story and having plates on (89:53 - 89:57)
the moon made ultra Sun and Ultra suit (89:55 - 90:01)
moans decisions make a little bit more (89:57 - 90:04)
sense like ultrasound ultra moon alone (90:01 - 90:06)
the story is a lot weaker if you hadn't (90:04 - 90:08)
played some intimate I don't disagree I (90:06 - 90:10)
just think the the amount of game you (90:08 - 90:12)
get an ultrasound on ultra moon is is (90:10 - 90:14)
significantly do you get you get a lot (90:12 - 90:18)
more game that is true just one thing (90:14 - 90:21)
that I I mean the kind of draws me to a (90:18 - 90:25)
sequel and like I wish that they could (90:21 - 90:28)
expand on more that I can't think of a (90:25 - 90:30)
lot of games that have done this but (90:28 - 90:32)
they did for black 2 and white 2 was (90:30 - 90:34)
they had that thing where you could (90:32 - 90:37)
transfer over some of your experiences (90:34 - 90:39)
and then as you went through the story (90:37 - 90:41)
it was like remember when this previous (90:39 - 90:43)
trainer came through and did this this (90:41 - 90:45)
and this and it was like memories of (90:43 - 90:48)
what things you had done but that was (90:45 - 90:51)
amazing it's like so simple such a (90:48 - 90:54)
little thing such a little touch but boy (90:51 - 90:56)
oh boy did it add so much meaning to (90:54 - 91:00)
those games yeah I mean if ultra seminal (90:56 - 91:02)
Furman had done that I probably would be (91:00 - 91:04)
on the sequel's more but like they did (91:02 - 91:06)
it from black and white to and then (91:04 - 91:09)
dropped it like a hot potato which like (91:06 - 91:10)
it does that's what doesn't sell me on (91:09 - 91:14)
sequels like even Ultra sudden Ultraman (91:10 - 91:16)
weren't really sequels they were (91:14 - 91:18)
certainly weren't yeah yeah they were (91:16 - 91:20)
they were just playing them they just (91:18 - 91:22)
figured it out they could sell two (91:20 - 91:25)
copies instead of one yeah so like if (91:22 - 91:27)
they were actually to put out a true (91:25 - 91:29)
true true sequel then I would probably (91:27 - 91:31)
be interested in that to finish their (91:29 - 91:32)
comment they would personally like a (91:31 - 91:35)
sequel this time we were offered a Jodo (91:32 - 91:37)
starter and only sudoku matters as well (91:35 - 91:39)
a circular again one been listening (91:37 - 91:41)
since I was playing heartgold it's crazy (91:39 - 91:43)
things that I'm still here listening to (91:41 - 91:46)
you boyos anyways happy 400 episodes why (91:43 - 91:48)
is that there's nothing crazy about that (91:46 - 91:49)
we good (91:48 - 91:51)
we do this in two (91:49 - 91:53)
[Laughter] (91:51 - 91:56)
so this is a question from grant hi I've (91:53 - 91:58)
been listening to your podcast for a (91:56 - 92:00)
while I'm on the younger side yet I (91:58 - 92:02)
still find it really awesome and (92:00 - 92:05)
entertaining I love your podcast so much (92:02 - 92:09)
my question is would you SHINee unlock (92:05 - 92:13)
za za za magenta Eternity and starters (92:09 - 92:16)
or keep them locked Thanks have an (92:13 - 92:18)
awesome day there were a lot of ease and (92:16 - 92:20)
awesome bye sure I just couldn't (92:18 - 92:29)
pronounce oh no I would keep them locked (92:20 - 92:34)
as well yeah I I agree I (92:29 - 92:37)
what what's nice about SHINee locking (92:34 - 92:39)
those particular Pokemon in the games is (92:37 - 92:41)
it in the future they can then do a (92:39 - 92:43)
distribution and everybody can get them (92:41 - 92:45)
as SHINee and then your whole soft (92:43 - 92:47)
reseting drama and everything is just (92:45 - 92:51)
for nature yeah and I mean people hate (92:47 - 92:54)
getting I don't know why there's a group (92:51 - 92:56)
of people that hate getting free shinies (92:54 - 92:59)
a bit although I would argue walking in (92:56 - 93:01)
the game stuff is much more difficult (92:59 - 93:05)
than a stressful situation right there I (93:01 - 93:08)
think the deeper I think the deeper (93:05 - 93:10)
reason I don't know if we've don't know (93:08 - 93:12)
I've said I talked about Pokemon too (93:10 - 93:13)
much I don't know if I've ever said this (93:12 - 93:15)
in the podcast or this is specifically a (93:13 - 93:17)
twitch stream thing but I don't think it (93:15 - 93:20)
was any secret I don't think it was an (93:17 - 93:23)
accident that in Sun and Moon those (93:20 - 93:24)
starter resets were like five minutes (93:23 - 93:28)
each right I don't think like anyone at (93:24 - 93:30)
the Pokemon company or anyone at Game (93:28 - 93:33)
Freak making the games were like Oh Jo (93:30 - 93:35)
she wouldn't we add a there's no (93:33 - 93:37)
Japanese person named Jo (93:35 - 93:40)
shouldn't we add a recess there is or a (93:37 - 93:42)
save right before the person picked up (93:40 - 93:44)
the starter like the the amount of ease (93:42 - 93:46)
they could have made that happen and (93:44 - 93:49)
they chose not to I think you're well (93:46 - 93:52)
aware they've been well aware since (93:49 - 93:54)
black and white that were prior to black (93:52 - 93:57)
and white that people want to reset for (93:54 - 94:00)
these things and they don't want those (93:57 - 94:03)
people to probably because my assumption (94:00 - 94:04)
is they want those people to play (94:03 - 94:05)
through the game (94:04 - 94:07)
and not worry about that and if you have (94:05 - 94:11)
somebody I I can think of for people on (94:07 - 94:15)
twitch that when sword and shield came (94:11 - 94:17)
out they were still softer setting for (94:15 - 94:20)
either Papa Leo Litton or Rowlett in one (94:17 - 94:24)
of their copies of Sun and Moon and I (94:20 - 94:26)
just don't think that's a good way to (94:24 - 94:28)
experience the game and I get it you (94:26 - 94:31)
paid the $40 experienced the game and (94:28 - 94:34)
how you want to experience it but if (94:31 - 94:36)
somebody's not getting to the end of (94:34 - 94:39)
black and white because they're still (94:36 - 94:43)
trying to soft reset for zekrom like (94:39 - 94:45)
they they might not ever see the ending (94:43 - 94:49)
to that game so I think it was smart (94:45 - 94:52)
although controversial to lock these (94:49 - 94:54)
Pokemon but at the same time I don't and (94:52 - 94:56)
I've always said this I don't think (94:54 - 94:58)
turning on and off your video game over (94:56 - 95:01)
and over is a great way to play a video (94:58 - 95:06)
game I just think I like it because it (95:01 - 95:10)
did encourage everybody to (95:06 - 95:13)
get into the game pretty quickly like I (95:10 - 95:14)
did do a little software setting for (95:13 - 95:16)
nature's not a lot because I knew mints (95:14 - 95:17)
were coming on now so that they just (95:16 - 95:19)
don't really matter when you're playing (95:17 - 95:20)
through the game they only really matter (95:19 - 95:24)
for competitive truly they can get (95:20 - 95:26)
through the game by over leveling so I (95:24 - 95:28)
think I like it because it encourages (95:26 - 95:32)
people to just just start playing the (95:28 - 95:35)
game get get into the content like don't (95:32 - 95:39)
worry about this don't waste fifty hours (95:35 - 95:41)
before you actually get to play the game (95:39 - 95:43)
especially when you hat you know we're (95:41 - 95:45)
in the era of content creation from (95:43 - 95:47)
these games and I'm sure they want (95:45 - 95:50)
people to be like don't have your (95:47 - 95:52)
content be 50 hours of software setting (95:50 - 95:54)
when our game immediately comes out just (95:52 - 95:56)
please start playing the game yeah and I (95:54 - 95:58)
think there is I don't know even though (95:56 - 96:00)
the people complain that like oh sigh (95:58 - 96:03)
guard was it zegart yeah it was Uyghur (96:00 - 96:05)
that was shiny locked and then they gave (96:03 - 96:08)
it as a game stop distribution for the (96:05 - 96:10)
year of legendary whether or not it's (96:08 - 96:13)
shiny I think is pretty irrelevant (96:10 - 96:16)
because the distributions are a time and (96:13 - 96:18)
place kind of thing and and we've (96:16 - 96:20)
learned with Maher shadow and we've (96:18 - 96:22)
learned with volcanion and we've learned (96:20 - 96:25)
with meloetta if you weren't or or (96:22 - 96:28)
panzer aura these Pokemon are incredibly (96:25 - 96:31)
rare now and they should be I mean they (96:28 - 96:33)
should be rare their mythical but (96:31 - 96:35)
they're rare because you had a full (96:33 - 96:38)
month which is a long time to walk into (96:35 - 96:40)
a Game Stop and get these (96:38 - 96:43)
and a lot of people didn't mm-hmm the (96:40 - 96:46)
same for zygarde that you had a month to (96:43 - 96:47)
get shiny zygarde and if you missed it (96:46 - 96:50)
you missed it some people don't care if (96:47 - 96:52)
they wanted to sit there and turn off (96:50 - 96:53)
their video game over and over and (96:52 - 96:55)
that's if that's how you enjoy a game (96:53 - 96:57)
that's cool I mean I've done it I've (96:55 - 97:00)
definitely turned off my switch 7,000 (96:57 - 97:04)
times for shiny Articuno and I can't say (97:00 - 97:05)
that at any point of that that was fun (97:04 - 97:08)
but I got a shiny Articuno at the end of (97:05 - 97:11)
it and I put it into the box and I don't (97:08 - 97:13)
think I've looked at it since but (97:11 - 97:16)
mission accomplished I guess I think of (97:13 - 97:19)
anything they have they have definitely (97:16 - 97:22)
leaned into Chinese (97:19 - 97:25)
mm-hmm and I don't think they have a (97:22 - 97:29)
good way for us to hunt like legendary (97:25 - 97:33)
shinies at this point so by locking it I (97:29 - 97:33)
guess (97:33 - 97:38)
they're at least letting people play the (97:33 - 97:40)
other parts of the game and not turn off (97:38 - 97:41)
and on their game (97:40 - 97:44)
yeah I don't I don't know what the I (97:41 - 97:45)
don't know what the future is for that I (97:44 - 97:47)
don't know how they they fix that or or (97:45 - 97:52)
get people to say like okay you can in (97:47 - 97:58)
this super ultimate pokemon sword in 15 (97:52 - 98:00)
years when we replay through it again (97:58 - 98:03)
you'll be able to hunt za Shion but it (98:00 - 98:06)
will be this way and not turn on an off (98:03 - 98:08)
your video game over and over I don't (98:06 - 98:10)
know what that looks like though I'm not (98:08 - 98:11)
a video game I don't have to be creative (98:10 - 98:14)
I'm not a video game creator not with (98:11 - 98:15)
that attitude (98:14 - 98:19)
Louis from our slack community asks will (98:15 - 98:22)
there be another top 10 Pokemon debate (98:19 - 98:25)
episode in the future oh my stomach he (98:22 - 98:27)
can't handle it I was so hungry at the (98:25 - 98:30)
end of that what was that like a (98:27 - 98:32)
five-hour recording that we ended up (98:30 - 98:34)
getting like three hours it was supposed (98:32 - 98:37)
to be like 30 minutes they'll throw away (98:34 - 98:40)
fun thing to do it was like 5 hours long (98:37 - 98:43)
and I was so hungry you know if I'd been (98:40 - 98:46)
there have been even longer yup (98:43 - 98:50)
so let's do another 180 hours yeah I (98:46 - 98:53)
mean we can do another one uh I don't (98:50 - 98:55)
know what that would entail I think the (98:53 - 98:57)
problem is like there's so many Pokemon (98:55 - 99:01)
right and it's so hard to like weigh the (98:57 - 99:03)
opinions that would have to be like top (99:01 - 99:07)
10 water pokemon or something like it (99:03 - 99:08)
where you would have to like cut it down (99:07 - 99:09)
dramatically (99:08 - 99:12)
I feel like top 10 water pokemon that (99:09 - 99:15)
our fish only okay all right Goldie (99:12 - 99:19)
number one number two bass : breakfast (99:15 - 99:22)
yeah I mean like I think they're I think (99:19 - 99:26)
there's an importance to have episodes (99:22 - 99:28)
that are not news focused although (99:26 - 99:30)
obviously there's a lot of Pokemon news (99:28 - 99:32)
that comes out so it's it's easy to keep (99:30 - 99:36)
doing a weekly show but I I think at a (99:32 - 99:39)
point in time that was a really good (99:36 - 99:40)
it was a really good episode to point (99:39 - 99:42)
people towards if they were unsure of (99:40 - 99:43)
where to start (99:42 - 99:45)
yeah but now I feel like that episode is (99:43 - 99:48)
very outdated oh yeah it is yeah this I (99:45 - 99:52)
still lived in DC remember those days (99:48 - 99:52)
what waiting for that excuse me (99:53 - 100:02)
taxes still has my card (99:59 - 100:05)
great you have a question from Kevin (100:02 - 100:07)
what has your favorite episode of is EEB (100:05 - 100:12)
in this is that Tuffy a hat is its go (100:07 - 100:14)
completely out of my memory the minute I (100:12 - 100:19)
walk away from you mind if I own like (100:14 - 100:22)
as a listener I mean I will put up this (100:19 - 100:24)
since we talked about the top 10 Pokemon (100:22 - 100:27)
debate was a joy to listen to even (100:24 - 100:28)
though I hated all of you for picking (100:27 - 100:31)
wrong and you did pick wrong so don't (100:28 - 100:33)
even try to defend your choices I still (100:31 - 100:37)
can't believe a Steve in his hole (100:33 - 100:39)
what was that product helix fossile he (100:37 - 100:43)
asked oh that he so easily forgot it was (100:39 - 100:45)
so important to him at that time sure (100:43 - 100:48)
what I didn't forget I just didn't buy (100:45 - 100:51)
that argument sure nightmare fuel that (100:48 - 100:53)
one if anything I'm still mad that (100:51 - 100:57)
Micah's Pokemon made the list so much (100:53 - 100:59)
it's like no one challenged it it was (100:57 - 101:02)
just like I like Gengar because it was (100:59 - 101:04)
the ghost Pokemon I caught and red and (101:02 - 101:05)
blue and everyone was like god this is (101:04 - 101:08)
good enough I mean who doesn't like (101:05 - 101:12)
Gengar huh a special game guy right (101:08 - 101:14)
now I think there's a lot of moments (101:12 - 101:16)
like the web zip moment is still up (101:14 - 101:17)
there (101:16 - 101:21)
I think that's very very funny it's hard (101:17 - 101:23)
to pick an episode because like a lot of (101:21 - 101:26)
the episode of news focuses like well (101:23 - 101:28)
that was just the news that time (101:26 - 101:30)
contrary to popular belief (101:28 - 101:32)
I've always liked listening to the live (101:30 - 101:34)
episodes that recorded at the paksas I (101:32 - 101:36)
think those were all very fun I know (101:34 - 101:39)
people don't like live episodes but I (101:36 - 101:41)
always enjoined them because I think the (101:39 - 101:43)
interactions with the fans and like (101:41 - 101:45)
little kids asking questions were always (101:43 - 101:48)
charming not a one particular episode (101:45 - 101:54)
cuz they've just been to many one but I (101:48 - 101:59)
think when we did years ago the what was (101:54 - 102:04)
it not patreon but the other one the (101:59 - 102:05)
fundraiser (102:04 - 102:08)
kickstart the Kickstarter and we have (102:05 - 102:10)
everybody all the guests come on and (102:08 - 102:14)
they would like we talked to everybody I (102:10 - 102:16)
really enjoyed those because we just had (102:14 - 102:18)
so many different people different (102:16 - 102:19)
perspectives and everything like that (102:18 - 102:23)
that that I enjoyed doing all of those (102:19 - 102:26)
and then Greg and I got into a fight (102:23 - 102:28)
yeah we did cuz you're wrong (102:26 - 102:30)
whatever (102:28 - 102:34)
Hey and we continue it to this day you (102:30 - 102:39)
this day so yeah I think those were (102:34 - 102:41)
probably among my favorites I mean I (102:39 - 102:45)
also you know started doing this with (102:41 - 102:47)
Justin and I enjoyed like a lot of doing (102:45 - 102:49)
all of the episodes with him because (102:47 - 102:51)
Justin is always so excited about things (102:49 - 102:53)
in a way that I don't get excited (102:51 - 102:57)
ever so that I think I'll always hold (102:53 - 103:00)
that fun a fond memories of that (102:57 - 103:03)
Rachelle goes what's the best / most (103:00 - 103:05)
useful life lesson you've learned from (103:03 - 103:08)
your experiences with Pokemon hmm I've (103:05 - 103:11)
learned that people on Instagram are (103:08 - 103:16)
consistently wrong I don't know why it's (103:11 - 103:19)
specifically Instagram but man no I have (103:16 - 103:21)
a serious answer well you can go though (103:19 - 103:27)
I was going to say that I remember like (103:21 - 103:30)
when we first met up at US Nationals in (103:27 - 103:33)
2012 and I didn't know anything about (103:30 - 103:37)
Eevee training or meta or anything for (103:33 - 103:43)
VG C's but I had my team and my life (103:37 - 103:45)
lesson was to just enjoy yourself (103:43 - 103:48)
because even if you've got a bad team (103:45 - 103:50)
you're there to have fun I don't know (103:48 - 103:54)
this is tough best most useful I think (103:50 - 103:56)
you know all of my years of dealing with (103:54 - 103:58)
Pokemon not just this podcast but and (103:56 - 104:01)
everything (103:58 - 104:04)
I think one of the best things that (104:01 - 104:06)
pokemon has been able to capture that (104:04 - 104:09)
doesn't exist in a lot of other fandoms (104:06 - 104:13)
is a very strong sense of community the (104:09 - 104:15)
fact that there's a strong working (104:13 - 104:19)
together trading and a focus on sort of (104:15 - 104:23)
friendly competitive that I think (104:19 - 104:25)
Pokemon more than anything introduces (104:23 - 104:30)
you to similar people who like things (104:25 - 104:36)
like you that mostly free from toxicity (104:30 - 104:39)
mostly I mean there's still some some (104:36 - 104:42)
darker aspects I think that the hold (104:39 - 104:44)
exit thing brought out some very dark (104:42 - 104:46)
things but I think in general community (104:44 - 104:49)
the community that Pokemon builds (104:46 - 104:53)
naturally through its gameplay is (104:49 - 104:55)
is one of the best things that I've (104:53 - 104:58)
gotten out of Pokemon I've made a lot of (104:55 - 105:00)
friends through the game I've made a lot (104:58 - 105:02)
of connections to the game that just (105:00 - 105:06)
weren't there before it's easy to bond (105:02 - 105:08)
over this I think Pokemon go really (105:06 - 105:10)
helped reinforce that it's easy to bond (105:08 - 105:12)
over Pokemon go as well like you can (105:10 - 105:14)
talk about these things as a shared (105:12 - 105:16)
experience and (105:14 - 105:19)
I would say more than a lot of other (105:16 - 105:22)
fandoms I've made a lot of (105:19 - 105:25)
great connections through Pokemon as a (105:22 - 105:28)
game as a fandom when I started the (105:25 - 105:34)
podcasts I was an idiot and not an idiot (105:28 - 105:38)
just a neophyte and I've definitely (105:34 - 105:41)
grown over the years it's funny because (105:38 - 105:44)
I was I found an old Trello board the (105:41 - 105:48)
other day and it was probably around the (105:44 - 105:53)
time before we'll was active on the (105:48 - 105:55)
podcast I would say yeah I don't (105:53 - 105:58)
remember ever using Trello so yeah and (105:55 - 106:00)
there was there was maybe like 20 people (105:58 - 106:03)
that was part of it and it was there's a (106:00 - 106:04)
bunch of people that wanted to somehow (106:03 - 106:06)
help out with the show whether that was (106:04 - 106:09)
writing or just helping with future (106:06 - 106:13)
episode concepts or whatnot I don't even (106:09 - 106:15)
remember how it got started (106:13 - 106:17)
but I just like read some of the things (106:15 - 106:20)
like the priorities I had and they were (106:17 - 106:23)
so they're just like wrong there was (106:20 - 106:26)
just like creating content and like (106:23 - 106:28)
reading them like this was a priority (106:26 - 106:30)
for me at the time was just like oh this (106:28 - 106:32)
is why none of this was successful back (106:30 - 106:36)
in the day I mean weren't you like 22 (106:32 - 106:39)
yeah yeah I wasn't goodness I've been it (106:36 - 106:41)
would have been 20 I think I would have (106:39 - 106:46)
been 21 when I started actually I mean (106:41 - 106:50)
so more than the two of us like the the (106:46 - 106:54)
years between 20 and 21 and 21 and 20 (106:50 - 106:56)
like there's a lot of just growth that (106:54 - 107:00)
adults go through then so I think like I (106:56 - 107:02)
also listened at very beginning and you (107:00 - 107:04)
are a very different person then when (107:02 - 107:07)
you started but you're also you and like (107:04 - 107:09)
like everybody does you had a lot of (107:07 - 107:12)
growth ending like in your 20s you were (107:09 - 107:16)
exposed to a lot more things and I will (107:12 - 107:19)
say to your credit I know a lot of (107:16 - 107:21)
people who are exposed to a big wide (107:19 - 107:23)
world who constantly knocks you down who (107:21 - 107:27)
become more obstinate and more awful and (107:23 - 107:30)
you didn't do that you have very much (107:27 - 107:32)
grown as a person and accepted (107:30 - 107:34)
everything that came your way and are (107:32 - 107:35)
willing to (107:34 - 107:38)
mostly except when you're wrong mostly (107:35 - 107:41)
and adapt to become a better person I (107:38 - 107:45)
think over this time period I think (107:41 - 107:47)
everybody can see that you have changed (107:45 - 107:50)
and improved yourself and improved your (107:47 - 107:52)
outlook which does not happen to a lot (107:50 - 107:55)
of people so if nothing else like it's (107:52 - 107:56)
easy to look back at our old cells and (107:55 - 107:59)
be like I can't believe that - it was oh (107:56 - 108:02)
that was 100% me a lot of people don't (107:59 - 108:04)
do that a lot of people can look at (108:02 - 108:06)
their past self and say well I'm the (108:04 - 108:11)
same and I think you you should be proud (108:06 - 108:17)
of who you've become through a lot of (108:11 - 108:19)
stuff that the world has thrown at you (108:17 - 108:22)
and still produce a lot of things that (108:19 - 108:24)
people enjoy and I think you should be (108:22 - 108:27)
proud of that yeah and I will say right (108:24 - 108:33)
that one thing just over the almost 10 (108:27 - 108:36)
years now that this podcast has existed (108:33 - 108:38)
is that and and you know this is like (108:36 - 108:40)
one of the core things that I always (108:38 - 108:42)
hold from my all for my own life right (108:40 - 108:45)
it's you know constant progress yeah I (108:42 - 108:48)
never I'm never gonna be perfect but I'm (108:45 - 108:50)
constantly progressing constantly (108:48 - 108:52)
improving and if you really just look (108:50 - 108:56)
over the amount of time that this is the (108:52 - 108:58)
podcast has been coming out it's just (108:56 - 109:01)
always progressing to become a better (108:58 - 109:04)
more professional you know even trying (109:01 - 109:06)
new things it's like if the new things (109:04 - 109:09)
don't work out you know quietly retiring (109:06 - 109:13)
them but just always moving towards a (109:09 - 109:16)
more professional and keeping you know (109:13 - 109:20)
eyes on constant improvement and making (109:16 - 109:24)
sure that the podcasts as a product is (109:20 - 109:27)
something that people are continuing to (109:24 - 109:30)
enjoy and continues to have value for (109:27 - 109:32)
the community where there's a lot of (109:30 - 109:34)
people and even people who have been (109:32 - 109:36)
doing podcasts for a decade or more (109:34 - 109:38)
where their podcast has literally not (109:36 - 109:42)
changed since day one yep I think that (109:38 - 109:44)
that's just like a huge testament to the (109:42 - 109:46)
amount of work that you know that Steve (109:44 - 109:49)
puts in to you know keeping his ears to (109:46 - 109:51)
the ground listening to what people want (109:49 - 109:53)
listening to what people have to say and (109:51 - 109:56)
listening to me and Greg - and others (109:53 - 109:57)
obviously because there's been many (109:56 - 110:01)
other people involved over time and (109:57 - 110:05)
saying you know like you know it is this (110:01 - 110:06)
something we should try is this (110:05 - 110:09)
something we shouldn't try why should we (110:06 - 110:10)
why shouldn't we should be discussed (110:09 - 110:13)
these topics in what way how do we bring (110:10 - 110:16)
this up do we just not bring this up and (110:13 - 110:18)
you know that that's a level of (110:16 - 110:23)
professionalism that probably (110:18 - 110:25)
I have to say like out ways like the (110:23 - 110:26)
amount of professionalism that's put (110:25 - 110:28)
into the recording of this program (110:26 - 110:33)
outweighs the monetary that you get back (110:28 - 110:36)
as compared to other programs that are (110:33 - 110:38)
on the same professional level does that (110:36 - 110:40)
make any sense that do those words in (110:38 - 110:46)
that order mostly okay thank you I mean (110:40 - 110:49)
there's no ads there used to be ads we (110:46 - 110:57)
did ads for Sox at one point we did do (110:49 - 110:59)
ads for a Sox at one point I am sure (110:57 - 111:02)
there's probably a path where I had (110:59 - 111:05)
could have made more click baby stuff (111:02 - 111:08)
even now on YouTube or whatnot and grow (111:05 - 111:11)
that audience quicker but I would rather (111:08 - 111:15)
take the slow route and just continue to (111:11 - 111:17)
be genuine and provide the most accurate (111:15 - 111:19)
information and we've gotten things (111:17 - 111:22)
wrong on the show before but I I still (111:19 - 111:25)
stand by like old me probably was trying (111:22 - 111:28)
to get numbers to grow quicker and new (111:25 - 111:32)
me doesn't like new me is too focused on (111:28 - 111:35)
the show being genuine the next question (111:32 - 111:40)
will surprise you though hey you won't (111:35 - 111:41)
believe the next question (111:40 - 111:45)
well we'll end on this question here (111:41 - 111:48)
Brandon says what is your favorite ISE (111:45 - 111:51)
memory that is not Pokemon related Gen (111:48 - 111:57)
Con 20s 2016 when I actually decided to (111:51 - 112:01)
drive across states to finally meet (111:57 - 112:02)
everybody (112:01 - 112:04)
like I had talked to you for Oh cuz (112:02 - 112:07)
we've been doing mythical and I still (112:04 - 112:11)
hadn't met anybody in person and I'd (112:07 - 112:12)
never done Gen Con and I was traveling (112:11 - 112:14)
by myself and I was gonna compete (112:12 - 112:17)
complete strangers I like this is this (112:14 - 112:20)
is such a bad idea but at least I'm at a (112:17 - 112:25)
convention so if I hate the mix it was (112:20 - 112:27)
great like it was a lot of fun like I (112:25 - 112:30)
had a better time that I was expecting I (112:27 - 112:33)
would probably say like what comes to (112:30 - 112:37)
mind first is there was one time and I (112:33 - 112:41)
don't even remember why I was visiting (112:37 - 112:42)
you and may have been visiting you for (112:41 - 112:44)
your birthday but I don't even remember (112:42 - 112:48)
if that was why and Jeff Dean came and (112:44 - 112:50)
we picked him up at the bus station okay (112:48 - 112:55)
then we like stayed up like completely (112:50 - 112:57)
overnight until like 6 o'clock the next (112:55 - 112:59)
morning playing board games I do (112:57 - 113:03)
remember this that was a lot of fun I (112:59 - 113:06)
don't know if we were talked about this (113:03 - 113:10)
but there was a I think it was 2016 (113:06 - 113:15)
where I got in contact with a lot of (113:10 - 113:17)
people who have done something with the (113:15 - 113:24)
show Greg will Logan Travis and we (113:17 - 113:29)
rented a house in the Wisconsin Dells I (113:24 - 113:32)
was there you were there and I think (113:29 - 113:35)
there was there was like 13 of us 14 of (113:32 - 113:39)
us yeah yeah and the Wisconsin Dells are (113:35 - 113:41)
in the middle of Wisconsin they're like (113:39 - 113:43)
an hour north of Madison Madison is like (113:41 - 113:46)
an hour west of Milwaukee it's like (113:43 - 113:50)
maybe three hours east of the Twin (113:46 - 113:52)
Cities (113:50 - 113:55)
three and a half three and a half and I (113:52 - 114:00)
Drive a lot they there's different hotel (113:55 - 114:03)
accommodations at the Wisconsin Dells (114:00 - 114:05)
and we ended up going to the Kalahari (114:03 - 114:07)
and they had this was this would have (114:05 - 114:13)
been December early December I think (114:07 - 114:16)
because the first week of December yeah (114:13 - 114:19)
cuz Sun and Moon were out they were out (114:16 - 114:22)
for almost a month and we rented a whole (114:19 - 114:26)
house and it had I think five or six (114:22 - 114:29)
bedrooms there was one in the basement (114:26 - 114:33)
there was hue on the main floor and then (114:29 - 114:37)
two on the top floor maybe three on the (114:33 - 114:41)
top floor and I have like two beds and (114:37 - 114:46)
Travis flew in and Logan flew in and (114:41 - 114:49)
then there was like and anyone from it (114:46 - 114:51)
and we'll flew in so there was like four (114:49 - 114:54)
cars that left Milwaukee with different (114:51 - 114:58)
people in it and different luggage and I (114:54 - 115:01)
think two cars left Minnesota yep and (114:58 - 115:04)
then we it could have easily been one (115:01 - 115:07)
but it didn't know those people yeah and (115:04 - 115:11)
there was the like 13 14 of us that we (115:07 - 115:14)
were at the cabin or like three or four (115:11 - 115:18)
days and it was it was fantastic it was (115:14 - 115:22)
like pee it was because of Iasi but it (115:18 - 115:25)
had nothing to do with the podcast and (115:22 - 115:26)
stuff and I do think we recorded some (115:25 - 115:29)
mythical there we did if we were to ever (115:26 - 115:30)
do it again which I don't know if that (115:29 - 115:34)
would be ever be possible (115:30 - 115:34)
just having all all those people to am (115:34 - 115:40)
playing checkbox to am playing TKO which (115:37 - 115:43)
I which my I did my best shirt is from (115:40 - 115:47)
that Gao the TKO shirts from those (115:43 - 115:52)
shirts that I mean I can't believe was (115:47 - 115:55)
up at 2 a.m. but but I think like 14 (115:52 - 115:58)
people renting the cabin came to like it (115:55 - 116:00)
was like $50 a night for a person it was (115:58 - 116:02)
like incredibly bad and everyone walked (116:00 - 116:04)
out spending like less than $200 and (116:02 - 116:08)
it's always why now like it's so hard (116:04 - 116:09)
for me to put GenCon on the list of (116:08 - 116:11)
things I want to do cuz Gen Con is like (116:09 - 116:15)
minimum $1,000 your numbers are way (116:11 - 116:18)
while for that but anyways no it's not (116:15 - 116:22)
Hotel minimum 199 yeah no the hotel is (116:18 - 116:24)
super expensive yeah but you don't share (116:22 - 116:27)
well that's that's true he does not (116:24 - 116:31)
share so like of the of the conventions (116:27 - 116:33)
I went to last year or some with you Jen (116:31 - 116:35)
kinda was my cheapest pax is (116:33 - 116:37)
significantly expensive alright (116:35 - 116:40)
yeah it's while yeah pax is real (116:37 - 116:42)
expensive but yeah I would love to do (116:40 - 116:44)
something like that again with more (116:42 - 116:46)
people I remember being very very (116:44 - 116:50)
worried about the initial however my (116:46 - 116:53)
however well the dynamics of having all (116:50 - 116:55)
those people in the house but also like (116:53 - 116:58)
the the price of the credit card to rent (116:55 - 117:01)
a house for yes three days although when (116:58 - 117:03)
you break it down into like 14 different (117:01 - 117:05)
people it it comes out to pennies but (117:03 - 117:08)
somebody has to pay that costs up front (117:05 - 117:10)
but yeah that was uh that's a really (117:08 - 117:12)
good weekend and I remember it was a lot (117:10 - 117:14)
of people playing board games or playing (117:12 - 117:17)
games the TV or just sitting around (117:14 - 117:21)
playing Sun and Moon and there was a (117:17 - 117:26)
complete indoor water park and amusement (117:21 - 117:30)
park and tons of restaurants and it was (117:26 - 117:33)
