[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 450th episode of the pokemon podcast it's super effective we have uh wait i'm your host sbj correct that is correct we have a heck of a show for you all today we got a lot to go through so terrible everything happened in the direct i thought there'd be many more announcements for pokemon yeah we saw like two 60-second trailers and we're going to spend about 60 minutes talking about the six seconds each one uh but also i gripe that you guys promised me last week it's recorded documented that you said we're gonna have announcements every day next week we kind of did there was one announcement of dubious quality they announced a pikachu weekend yeah there were other announcements look promises were made and promises were not kept that is broken all right will is here i okay might as i promised you i had two profound realizations number one sour punch bites candy of the year i have not enjoyed candy in easily 28 years i cannot get enough of sour punch bites i was literally the real winner of kanto tour yeah is this what but is this the big win out of canter our canto tour but here's the other the the first deep and profound realization and this is directed towards steve steve which of the fried rices is your favorite fried rice the one with the egg in it oh he thought i was gonna i could have sworn he was gonna never wait they all have egg that's why they get it i i was gonna swear that he's gonna say like oh no i don't eat no fried rice no fried rice is the only rest i like wait what and they're like they like flip the egg and then they like dice it up and then they put the the the salt that's some good fried rice salsa then they make the little volcano with the onion rings man i was gonna be like chicken pork shrimp beef and he was gonna be like i don't eat fried rice because that's got a vegetable in it they do man they normally have like carrots or something you gotta eat around those they gotta you don't what you don't you can't eat a pee no i mean you maybe well like when i go to like panda express number one food the pinnacle of chinese food i um we had this discussion last week it was leanne chin leanne chan you had an option to go to lee engines and you skipped it look irene and i had delicious lianchens and you had a rocket burger of dubious quality it was not the best greg also here hi i'm here representing lee engines a local chinese fast food restaurant uh that is way better than panda express okay before we get into the pokemon news when i was standing in line at the johnny rockets the lady in front of me said hey can i get the bacon cheeseburger buttons she said can i get the bacon cheeseburger with no bake okay so i i have i okay yeah you could do that totally so the thing is i i frequent a another local uh restaurant here called blue door blue door pub yes um which has nice wings decent wings um they literally do not have a single burger on their menu that does not come with cheese automatically so i frequently have to order the kids cheeseburger without cheese because it's the only way to get a regular hamburger this is a chinese place no yes chinese restaurant and hamburgers i have never eaten adelie engines oh i mean the enchants fast food is not as good as the ulta done restaurants used to be but there's i mean they're a better quality than panda express not a high bar but still a bar that they easily clear well i will have to try them because uh my local chinese i mean this is what started it all right i was so incredibly disappointed because i ordered rice noodle soup uh with chicken and to me that means you get like a soup with rice noodles and some chicken in it and it was like literally like some wet rice noodles with like chicken and snow peas put on top quality how do you even call that a soup did they say a separate thing with broth and forget it i did buddy um we can't keep talking about chicken and rice we can i mean we can talk about chicken and rice for a long time because rice is my favorite food chinese is one of my favorite all-time cuisines is this something that greg and i have in common white rice is white rice is my favorite food in the world japanese style sticky white rice is my favorite food in the world i will oh i mean i only like chipotle because of the rice component do you know what goes great with rice kimchi okay uh let's do the pokemon 25 music first and then we'll do the diamond pearl then we'll do the legends and then we got a lot to talk about all right are we going to give our reviews of pokemon tour uh yeah we'll do that i can't do it i think we started off with the post malone stuff because that was literally last night fresh on her mind um this is off the this is the pokemon press release here uh pokemon announces a collaboration with jay balvin and unveils plans for p25 music album which is a compliment compilation album featuring katy perry jay baldwin post malone and more it will be released by capitol records in the fall of 2021 so now we have a date of when that music is coming uh the p25 music program details revealed following the virtual music concert with post malone including additional calibrations collaborations with trends setting new artists as pokemon celebrates 25 years and it kind of goes on saying you know these artists will each release a song of the delight of fans around 25 years and pokemon is this journey and it's it's a it's a pretty boring press release but that being said uh i didn't know who jay baldwin was last night neither did i yes they are a latin american artist i believe that has won four music awards of of what type music awards from where grammys i know i was like grammys you know that kind of stuff people's choice billboard they won five billboard latin music awards four latin grammys two mtv music video awards four latin american music awards two grammy and received two grammy nov nominations and won a bunch of other stuff in latin america so uh they're 35 they have worked with bad bunny sean paul for pharrell williams rosalia cardi b um rose ross they he seriously like did something with rosalia yeah yeah yeah that's what it says those are the associated acts dj khaled uh i mean i do know most of these except for that first one you said it makes sense pokemon's a worldwide brand to have artists from around the world especially since we know that there's a big latin america um pokemon audience specifically with pokemon go i think pokemon go is huge in latin america so it makes sense for this album that will be released i'm assuming we're going to get like a japanese artist and a korean artist um maybe bts i don't know but yeah maybe some shakira oh i feel like shakira would be on the album oh yeah people like people like shakira more than katy perry right well that that's hard to say yes yeah that's a difficult territory to wander into hips don't lie i mean people like what they like and there's all different tastes for music so okay well give me give me your thoughts post malone concert so i i enjoyed it quite a bit the i don't know i mean the the overall experience i i really did like i i had fun i think that the whole way that it was animated and everything was like what they chose for the animations was great the fun you know the gyarados was really exciting and entertaining and the different like the the stampeding poditas or rapidashes going across the plains whatever my my biggest reaction to the actual post malone though was like uh i think the best way to say it is i guess hands really are difficult to draw because there was something wrong with the hands on that cgi character there i don't think i noticed like they they're not good at drawing humans they're really good at drawing pokemon but not humans um yeah i will uh i will give pokemon props for making this an event uh and they really did hype it up and i was really excited i streamed it even though i streamed it in a way where it was okay to stream it which was hey you can look at my face [Music] and on a different tab watch post below right because i i which i didn't do because i was doing other things but i did watch the post malone concert after yeah and um we had a lot of people in stream and very excited and then all of a sudden four songs later he was like thank you have a good night yeah yeah it was longer i had i have a couple things one sort of had thought there might be more actual pokemon music and not here three post malone's hits and the weird cover of hoodie and the blowfish that he made sort of pokemon related pokemon it has pokemon music in it yes music in it but what does that song have to do with i don't think that song itself has to do anything m2m's uh song didn't have anything to do with pokemon back in 99 yeah i mean it's just it's just was i just sort of like oh it's these four songs well because it's like because when remember when ash and pikachu were dying because martial powered up the evil pokemons and they and and that poke pikachu turns to ash and says i just want to be with you right because that's why he wouldn't go in the ball so like i only want to be with you there you go i answered the mystery okay only like two years later it's a long scan it was a long scam i loved the backgrounds uh there was an entire section where he walked with his hand on his hip that looked exactly like rosalia from uh coliseum i was very into that uh i found his pants animation i couldn't tell if they were supposed to be plastic or leather slightly yeah they were slightly distracting uh i liked like all the backgrounds like the world they did was amazing it's just i felt like there should either be more songs or i guess i just wasn't expecting a post malone concert set in the pokemon world yeah that's exactly what they advertised was a stronger connection there wasn't i didn't i enjoyed it uh mostly but what saved it was jigglypuff at the end that 100 saved that entire experience for me i i i didn't think it needed saving i i enjoyed the whole thing but i will say that jigglypuff at the end the worst part about the whole thing is just how short it was like that was really short which was fine i like i i don't know that i could have taken i thought it was going to be at least like 45 minutes i don't know that i could have watched that foreign oh i could have the backgrounds were awesome like i mean not being a huge post malone fan i was like oh i've heard this song before i didn't know it was his song like no i know the week before i did look up a couple of his songs and i was like oh yeah i've heard this before in like a commercial in and out of my brain so part of the problem is i think number one like post malone to start with was an odd choice because not a g rated pg 13 even rated performer right the majority of post malone's music is not for the general public's consumption go out radio edits okay yeah yeah right like like circles is not circles does have a couple spicy spices it has a couple of blue moments in it yes but my expectation okay so i i would say like my high level expectation was that it would be like you would get to a certain point and be like and here's katy perry and then katy perry would do a song yeah yeah katy perry is involved right but at the very least to have like one or two other artists perform songs as well and yeah just like there was at least one other artist on that stage and they didn't let that artist perform i really thought he was going to be honest on that stage okay even though he he did four songs um because that's what they tweeted the the the the set list um he did four songs i really thought he was gonna do like one pokemon song like the pokemon theme song or something not like not maybe the poker wrap cause that's a little corny but um i thought there would be at least one remake like like he already did a cover i thought oh you they'll do another cover of another one of the famous songs and that just didn't happen so i think that's what made me feel weird about the whole thing because it was just like the only reason i'm attending a post malone concert a thing i don't have any interest in is for pokemon backgrounds yeah i could see if you're not a fan of his music you're just like oh there's charizard there's flying around there's slugma there's no the there's the best umbreon bop into the music which is the highlight of that whole song yeah no no no no no no the the shanatics oh yeah the [ __ ] actually there was a lot the backgrounds were great but again that almost made it to pokemon of the week here that's how good those those genetics were i don't know who animated it but it was really well animated um and for better for i don't know i think it was animated better than it should have been like i had pretty low expectations and they kind of went all out on the animation side but i also feel like they were like we have a budget and the team was like okay cool okay we we ran out of budget so uh like we could only maybe do like 14 minutes we were aiming for an hour but uh we could only animate 14 minutes we're out of money i don't know it kind of that makes me like think of back and of course only greg will understand me when i say this abc news paid to have a computer animation of the earth spinning as the intro to abc news and whatever company was paid to do it had the earth spinning in the wrong direction in the wrong direction forever they could never cost so much money to make it fix it [Music] i don't rendering rendering graphics is uh takes a lot of processing okay well let's move on to the big news here there was a pokemon presents on friday morning or afternoon if you're in the uk or at night if you were in japan um we'll just go through the whole press release first and then uh we'll break it into the the three parts because the the presents really showed three games and that was kind of it uh it says today during the pokemon presents a video presentation ishihara the president and ceo of the pokemon company announced the new pokemon brilliant diamond shining pearl and pokemon legends arceus video games coming to the blockbuster series that spanned 25 years pokemon brilliant diamond and shining pearl will launch late 2021 and pokemon legends arceus will launch early 2022 all three games will be exclusive will be exclusive on the nintendo switch systems in 2006 trainers were introduced to the cinahl region with the release of pokemon diamond and pearl in the nintendo ds system players can once again visit the cinahl region in brilliant diamond and shining pearl which are faithful remakes of the two iconic pokemon games pokemon legends arceus will introduce fans to the center region of old before the existence of pokemon trainers and pokemon leagues in this long in this long gone era that players will embark on an entirely new adventure to recreate the re to create sorry to create the region's first pokedex quote trainers caught their first pokemon in 1996 and began an adventure that lasted 25 years through eight regions many different platforms countless pokemon encounters they strive to be the very best said ishihara we hope fans of all ages will continue creating new memories while exploring the cino regions in in this new game more details about the highly anticipated new pokemon snap were also shared um okay so each game one by one pokemon brilliant diamond and shining pearl developed by ilka or i think that that's what they said in the presentation or ilca directed by masuda um of of game co-directed yeah well look i'm going through the present directed by you yeah yeah yeah yeah co-directed it doesn't say good okay okay i'm just reading i'm just reading um judea from ilika are the two directors um pokemon brilliant diamond and shining pearl enable fans to experience the original story and game features from diamond and pearl in a fresh way the original games have been faithfully reproduced and color colorfully revitalized colorful colorfully called cook uh revitalize for the i'm just gonna move on let's move on the sense of scale literally pounds of roots have been carefully preserved and fans who played the original games will recognize many familiar places the games are updated with easy to understand player friendly conveniences introduced in recent pokemon core series video games in addition to up close and personal pokemon battle scenes uh trainers can choose tur twig chimchar piplup find diagopalkia moving on they have all the stats for these pokemon we're gonna skip through that okay pokemon legends arceus the fun of exploring while catching pokemon and filling a pokedex has always been a core part of a pokemon video game series pokemon legends arceus was developed to with the desire to deliver an experience infused with a new action and rpg elements that go beyond the framework established thus far while honoring the core gameplay of past pokemon titles as trainers explore the natural expanses in pokemon legends arceus they will encounter pokemon that call these grand vistas home to catch wild pokemon players can study the pokemon behaviors sneak up to them throw pokeballs players can also battle wild pokemon with their ally pokemon by throwing the pokeball holding their ally pokemon near a wild pokemon players will seamlessly enter a battle the new gameplay angle is intended to provide trainers with an immersive experience pokemon legends arceus brings trainers to the vast sino region as it existed in the past long before setting diamond and pearl long before the setting of diamond and pearl were established rich in nature and with mount coronet towering at its heart this is sinnoh unlike anything trainers have experienced as they embark to create the region's first pokedex as they start off their adventure trainers will be able to choose rowlet cyndaquil oshawott as their first partner pokemon these pokemon arrived with the pokemon professor he doesn't have a name yet who encountered them on the research to these various regions i don't spoilers for this game rowlet evolves into deciduous and evolves into typology we know the final evil evolutions um and then finally the new pokemon snap was announced a video game that takes the role of budding pokemon photographer in the lentil region they will work with professor mir the region's expert the game will be available on april 30th i actually don't think this press release says anything new but we did see new things in the um what how is lentil spelled l-e-n-t-a-l yep oh lentil because i can't all i could think of was like the little like the little bean of bean pea things yeah they're real tasty okay we're going to be like all over the place here um because you're going to keep us organized yeah yeah yeah follow the outline we didn't make i feel like the actual biggest news from this entire event isn't the isn't diamond and pro remakes that's like saying that the the sun will set every day that's true we we all know it's going to happen um pokemon arceus isn't that surprising since we've known for quite a while that they've had that the rpg elements were being worked on i remember we on the show we covered like oh they're copying the yokai watch system or oh they're copying digimon cyber sleuth system like that was a very loose rumor i think the biggest news is game freak is using another studio to make a main series pokemon game well that's part of it but i i kind of have like my spider sense intuition of why that is happening um which is what i mean which is what i okay so this is my overall fear this is my overall theory of what we saw tell me why i love computer art the company i love computer artists that's really what it's doing i lca says her i like gather your thoughts well we can um gather them up i do have this nintendo life uh some history about ilka the japanese studio working so this will be our first part of the podcast we're going to talk about ilka which will probably lead into these two games um ilka is a japanese studio headquartered a headquartered in tokyo in the shinjuku distr uh they have three offices they have one in shinjuku naga and naganeta and then kyoto it was established in october of 2010 they are cg based video company with a with a focus on animation uh movies and television and then they incorporated video games after the fact and as of 2020 they have 288 employees and i believe uh gamefreak had around 250 employees during the development of sword and shield so it's no surprise that the games look very much like the mewtwo the new mewtwo movie the cgi one that we never got as far as i remember ilka stands for that coming did they come to netflix maybe it did yeah the the mewtwo movie came to netflix uh ilka stands for i love computer art computer i already covered that that was not a joke by greg that's actually what it stood for uh they did work on pokemon home um and they have worked on regular games augmented reality titles virtual reality games and various stuff including a domino's pizza app featuring hatsune miku they are also associated with when they say associated with in this article i'm this article is from nintendo life by the way i'm not sure if that means they were the main developer i don't think so um but it says they they assisted and uh with yakuza 0 dragon quest 11 near automata naruto ship was my naruto good naruto naruto shippuden ultimate ninja storm 4. and east combat cs7 yo going from ace combat to pokemon uh and that's that's pretty much it that's you know they've worked on their games they worked on pokemon home which that's not a that's not a real good thing that's not a star thing to have on your resume but it is a thing uh okay so going back to will your thoughts on ilka all right i think let me put it this way um and what i i may make a statement here that we then have to come back to later number one i now accept that it is uh unlikely no i'm not gonna put it that way here's what i'm putting together in my head the exact thing that who was the guy who was not not the president of pokemon but the other guy who was doing the presentation that guy is she how's that guy no no no no no no the the younger guy oh the second guy that came through yeah i don't remember what he was that was the first time i feel like he was ever in a direct i that's why i can't like think of his name um so what he specifically said when they announced uh the pokemon legends arceus right he said a new era of pokemon games begins specifically specifically what they said so from my perspective the piece of having a different company do the remake or update uh it's not an update it's just almost like it's a re-skinning almost of diamond and pearl and having them then make that statement a new era of pokemon games begins i take that as pokemon the main pokemon game freak creatures pokemon company international whoever else is in that mix they don't want to do these kinds of games anymore i don't think that's it that let me finish my statement okay okay and they will outsource those games to companies that they can trust that will take the ip that already exists and that you know if we are going to get a gen 5 remake it's going to be the same kind of thing it'll be some other company that will take the core property and you know update it for whatever system it's going to appear on um and then the pokemon company is going to focus and it's going to be just like this step by step that we've been taking of you know wild area all right let's do something that's all wild area okay now it's like the entire game is wild area um and we want it to be more of this mmo rpg looking type thing rather than the you are on rails in this story you've got to go jim jim jim jim jim defeat and then see whatever other story big bad evil is there okay we gotta move away from mmo rpg or open world game is not automatically better than a game that is linear like i don't know why i didn't i didn't say better or worse i just said they don't want to do linear game anymore so that's why they said a new era is beginning because it's like we're going to be doing breath of the wild we're not going to be doing i mean they did pokemon quest i i don't buy the theory that like they're tired of doing pokemon i think the the actual so so if we were to go back to complaints prior to sword and shield the complaint was like this game is rushed why doesn't game freak hire more people why why are they rushing this game i wish they didn't come out with pokemon games every year they should take their time like pokemon games are coming out every year and like this is why they're bad like these are all like the complaints you normally read and instead of game freak just hiring more people which is one not easy to what not easy for a lot of things you gotta find people you gotta have a place for those people you gotta train those people like it's just not something that happens overnight um but also as a company maybe they just don't wanna hire more people like as a company they might be content with like we have 200 some people working here we don't want 250 because they don't have to right like they're a private company they don't need to do that if they don't want to but what's better than hiring more people how about we just have a whole another studio yeah making a game and i don't think like if you look at other game developers like uh like call of duty they have two people working on different games so they have enough time to put out call of duty every year but that is that doesn't mean that either studio hates working on call of duty i don't think that game freak in general is like oh we're we're so sick of making linear pokemon they made pokemon quest and it was like one of the most delightful games ever and it was very unique to what they've done before what i think that's i'm between i'm starting a little bit on wilson what i think what they're pointing out is things like remakes things where the game is already established things where they don't need to push in a new direction they don't need to design new pokemon they don't need to like remakes are already established they have what's in those games they have a huge pool of already established assets i think what they're saying is we are now freeing ourselves from keeping that in-house and and allowing other companies to take on the remakes and other things that use existing act you know assets and we are now going to focus much more on what we're going to make in the future the new games that are coming yeah new gens then something transformative yeah mechanics i mean other other nintendo studios and other studios in general have resourced out their older games so they can keep working on new games like hey yeah and i think that's what they were talking about i think they're stating like this is our first time we're going to give an entire remake to a different company and that's probably what we're going to do going forward because we don't need to remake those games right we are now going to make the gen 9 the gen 10 and that doesn't mean that they aren't going to make other games like conquest i think they're still going to be the ones that are going to push they're they're going to be the ice breaker right they're going to be the ship that's in front deciding what the path is and they'll hire people to take care of the stuff that that's been established uh but i still think game freak and all that is still going to be the main driver of what new will come in the game series but i i agree but i i would say slightly differently from that um the the two things i would say that are slightly different from that the number one the diamond and pearl remakes are not boris right brilliant diamond i don't even know what the pro one is because they just said shiny pearl yeah it's not it's not oris right they are not taking and this is some complaints that i've received from people right they're not taking the current state of the game they're not taking sword and shield and then using that as like the template on or using diamond pearl as a template for sword and shields type mechanics there's not going to be a wild area around mount coronet right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right we don't know it's not good there could be we don't i think that they made it like they said so many times you you will recognize yes all these different pieces i i think what they mean by conveniences for like updated conveniences is like probably no hms yeah yeah right yeah updated convenience is probably no hms the pc is with you everywhere uh rare candy level 100 trick where you can evolve like every quality of life they did in certain shield um right those kinds of things but yeah but i doubt we'll see dynamaxx i doubt we'll see mega evolution it's going to be like what was available in the diamond and pearl world is what will be available i i don't know about that like they could have just one arena at the end of the game where you can just dynamax in they could just i mean i i'll put my money down i will be shocked they i think they may add they may add those things post game like they did for a lot of things like sun and moon like sun and moon had mega after you completed the game they may add in dynamics and it's not like you're dying to maxing on a route or you're dynamic in the wild there you're specifically dynamic in set locations like it's way easier to control than the other half of what i believe about this is and and right you don't have to agree with me there's and there's literally no science to be done here i disagree we will not show you until the future occurs but i honestly believe that this is them saying we will not be doing these kinds of games at all anymore i mean that that's right though no yeah i guess i'm very happy game freak is like we have 250 people and we know that game freak has two teams they have an a team in the b team and during the development of sword and shield they said the a team was working on well they specifically said the a team isn't the main team that they just have an a team and a b team um but they said the a team was working on a little town hero and the b team was working on um sword and shield and wha during that development people from the a team and people from the b team mid development would switch um to carry over ideals and gameplay mechanics and you know to keep it fresh so they're not working on the same game for three years uh so like if if they have two teams still because i don't think they hired any people i don't think any company is really hiring a bunch of people during a pandemic but if they still have two teams the general thought process was okay one team was working on let's go pikachu let's go eevee one team was working on sword and shield let's go pikachu let's go eevee came out a year later sword and shield came out team is working on dlc which came out all of last year so the thought process was okay that other team must be working on diamond pro remix while this other team is finishing up dlc but now we know that that isn't the case so they can make it right they can make there is probably a team right now working on gen 10. so yeah either we're sorry not to ten we're just skipping nine we're just going to skip and die fundamentally what i'm saying is whatever the future of pokemon games is coming from the pokemon it will not be uh you're presented with three starters i i i think i think gen nine will be you're presented with three starters you're going through the route you're doing eight gems there's not even gym leaders there's this is a the the arc archaeas is a single-player game there is no online component to it that's said on the japanese website there's no battling other trainers via the internet there's no local battling that we know of because it specifically says on the japanese website it doesn't there are no gym leaders in this game because they don't exist yeah i i think that still any anything that we get in the future is going to be more of uh sort of choose your own path side quests i think this is just a main series game that is not the same as a main generation game like let's go pikachu let's go eevee like let's go eevee let's go easy still a main series game but it's a little bit different than i don't think you're going to convince me i think when they said a new era of pokemon games begins i i think that they're meaning really saying we're closing the book on doing no there's no way gen 9 doesn't introduce a hundred new pokemon you pick three starters you become the champion you pair a tv show with it february 28 2021 let's we'll see we'll see i i think people have this mindset of like like sorry pokemon fans you're really uncreative like the the problem with something like let's go pikachu let's go evie when it came out while it was a different pokemon game it was still a pokemon game that shared similar beats as other pokemon games right just like this arceus game you'll be able to catch you'll be able to train you'll be able to explore like those are beats of a pokemon game um no one goes that like uh spirit tracks or what was that other pokemon game or zelda game not minish cap the the one the phantom hourglass those two specific zelda games were completely controlled with the stylus there there was no there was no d-pad you can even look at a game like skyward sword completely in motion control and those are still considered main series zelda games even though they did something different um and pokemon games have started to do that in the sense of like let's go pikachu let's go the main series pokemon game but you use motion control and this seems to be a main series pokemon game arceus uh because something uh joe joe from cerebe said something on the japanese website signified that it would be i couldn't find what that is and he wasn't very clear but i trust him in that in that regard um also it's being made by game freak uh but it doesn't have to always match up just like we don't have to ever get a let's go johto or a let's go sinnoh because we didn't like not every zelda game after skyward sword was forced in motion control right like we don't have to follow these patterns of one off game sometimes a company just wants to try something new and that's fine and then they go back to like how could they not go back to you pick three starters you go through eight gyms you beat a champion i don't know that formula sold 20 million copies like it was it's very proven over the 25 years that that formula works very well just like in a mario game it's it works very well to say hey collect all these things if you get enough of them you fight bowser at the end cool look even stephen king has stopped writing horror novels [Laughter] i mean has he though no i'm kidding come on i i just feel like they that they my sense that i'm getting is that they are tired of making the same game over and over and over again and they really want to take it in a completely new direction i don't without looking back i don't think so i think sword and shield like sword and shield a little thin compared to past pokemon games off the bat but with the inclusion of the dlc which is always the argument in video game culture they should the dlc should have been here the whole time but like the isle of armor in my opinion is probably the best like the the actual area is like the best part of sword and shield like being able to explore that no tundra is better crown tundra is weird because you can't do it tundra is so much better than isle of armor get out of here with your garbage tape like the forest the little swamp area the sharpiedos we all love sharpieda no we don't that's awful okay like like i predicted we're all over the place we haven't talked about a single game here um i don't think that we're gonna take a break here in a second but i i think that ilka helping or being the new like they they worked on pokemon home which is not a great thing in my opinion to be like hey we worked on pokemon home because i don't think pokemon home is as good as it can be look your resume can either include include facts or lies yes all right yeah i don't think pokemon home i think pokemon home suffers from it doesn't know what it wants to be and no no okay but it could be let's look at the words ilka and pokemon home right i i will bet you dollars to donuts which is a phrase i hate saying ilka did the graphics for pokemon home and you know what those the graphics that are in there aren't aren't that bad well if they did the i don't think they designed how it works yeah maybe i think so yeah i guess we don't know the full yeah the full scale of that i think though like if if at the end of the day even if you don't care about what company is making what game which probably the majority of people who walk into target or walmart and buy a pokemon game and play like those people don't care right like um i i think though that this solution was better than what 16 year olds on reddit was screaming about which is like hire more people like the solution of let's have another company help us do these games one so we can continue putting out pokemon games every year and two neither of these teams are consistently underwater because the actual takeaway here is the pokemon company itself is this huge machine that cannot be stopped it keeps moving forward every year there's tcg sets every three months there's anime there's a brand new anime every single year every year they put out a movie there's non-stop merch and they cannot have a game stop because that stops everything else that goes along with it it stops the merchandise it stops the tcg it stops the anime and once you stop those things all of a sudden those voice actors are not getting paid all of a sudden those distributors are not being able to order cards and ship them over all of a sudden the people working on the movie have to like twiddle their thumbs like you're stopping so many things um that not only are you stopping things for your customers you're stopping things for the people who rely on that as a job so i think like this is the best of both worlds of we have another company in here to alleviate and give both studios more times to make a better game um can i can i have one request post malone concert over for 2021 can we stop referring to reddit as having a valued opinion on anything like it's 11 of the internet populace uses reddit and that's just such a small market okay everybody i know is on there though it's like that's so disappointing like they aren't they aren't a huge segment of the populace their boycott for sword and shield really it didn't do anything like we keep talking about reddit like they're important it's not just my one wish if we could stop thinking that anything that reddit has to say is really impactful in any manner that would just make me happy so did you read on reddit that no i don't read reddit there's nothing interesting there ever i i think it's i think it's just the problem that we we deal with as or maybe i deal with directly because people come on twitch and they say like oh i read this on twitter i read this on reddit did you see this facebook group and then we have to like kind of clear up this conversation of like what's actually happening so when i say reddit i'm just thinking of the people that are consistently yelling like the people that were were like the people that said a year ago i don't want game freak touching diamond and pearl because they'll ruin it and then they're like well gabriel's not making it and then those people were still upset yeah that's just yeah i mean those people will never be happy if you go to the upset factory you can't be bothered that the product that they're giving out is being upset like reddit is there to churn out people being angry so if you're gonna go to reddit and say everybody on reddit's mad what did you expect i went to the shoe store not expecting to buy bread like yes we can just stop it's the same like everybody on twitter quote unquote twitter is a small amount of people yes who are just screaming at about a bunch of things to get noticed like these are not valid benchmarks upon which to judge everybody's approval or disapproval about the game yeah but you can't just ignore those all together because there are things on reddit and you really can't no no no there are things on reddit twitter that do bring things to life like the whole fact like i i didn't know the four times i watched this trailer that the one npc standing in flora town was the npc from platinum you could ask me i knew that well i didn't see you tweet it or posted on reddit now did i well because i don't that what does i mean that doesn't you know how many retweets you could have got greg yeah it does add it because people are wondering it's like will they have the platinum post game in these games and it appears that they're going to do like they did with aorus and have the emerald posters yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah okay but they didn't have all of the emerald post game right like all of battle factory wasn't in oris we can't say they're going to have the full platinum yeah yeah yeah post game man i came to the battle factory and i got a shoe greg your whole world is screwed up but the thing is is like to think that they aren't going to include the improvements in platinum is a wild take since they aren't going to remake that game they made the two they haven't like they didn't remake crystal they didn't remake emerald they barely remade yellow they don't tend to remake the third games but they tend to throughout all these games include the benefits and the quality of life things that appeared in that third game in that remake they have done that every time i don't think that's groundbreaking to point out that the person that gives you the flower for a thing that appears right she gives you shaman yeah is in this game it's a great flower thank you yeah okay it's just not well we have to we haven't actually talked about the games themselves i know we'll get there so let's take a break okay and then we'll come back we'll start off talking about legends and then we'll talk about the lego toy diamond don't start i hate that so much wow [Music] [Music] and then i say that is a dynamics band and we are back so let's talk about pokemon legends arceus they said arceus multiple times oh come on they locked that in when they built the rks system and yeah but detective pikachu they said rcs and it was a little confusing i had to correct people on twitter it's fine it's arceus just it's the same as the pokedex 3d pro it's the same as uh pokemon battle revolution the little like the yes uh thing you know somebody somebody on twitter greg said uh you know you can't you have to take it with a grain of salt and my thought process is if the ceo of the pokemon company is saying arceus i don't know i don't know what kind of salt we buying but i don't know who to believe at that point then i feel like you can say whatever you want yeah yes officially it is arceus yes the whole point of mythical names is so that when you say it everyone regardless of language knows what you're talking about but obviously accents and stuff come into play i i'm fine with arceus but when people start telling me that kellaby is wrong that's when i'm gonna start fighting or cinderache come on well cinderacci is not a mythical kelluby is oh yeah okay so available early 2022 they showed like a two-minute trailer although i would i would probably say there was only like 60 seconds of uh gameplay footage uh the pokemon legends arceus game will honor pokemon's core gameplay while infusing a new action rpg you'll need to catch survey and research wild pokemon in the long gone era of sinnoh to recreate the first pokedex so we kind of got what the premise of the game is make the pokedex sounds like you're done yep um to catch pokemon you can observe them learn their behavior sneak up carefully aim your pokeball let it fly right off their website uh you can have your ally pokemon battle wild pokemon that you hope to catch just throw the pokeball holding your ally pokemon near a wild pokemon and you will seamlessly enter a battle and command your pokemon by choosing the moves it knows it looks like they copy and pasted the swish blue swish from sun and moon behind the like hp bar do you guys remember that in sun and moon battles they had like those swishes behind the bars oh yeah vaguely kind of listen since i played those games thinking about it you'll be brought to the center region the setting uh for diamond and pearl but this is long before those uh before ideals of being a trainer or having a pokemon league even existed which kind of hints that there doesn't seem to be other trainers or other no gems i mean no gyms definitely um i would imagine that there will be other trainers but not sort of like i'm a pokemon trainer yeah right title i'm also imagining there will be some sort of bad guy element to the game yes like i don't know i don't um i i do think that in your in your pursuits you'll run into people who are who are who are doing things for a quote-unquote unkind purpose and you will have to stop them the truth is it's hard to have story it's hard to have narrative without conflict right right there's going to be some there's going to be some sort of conflict to drive the game pokemon snap really does well without needing conflict oh trust me the conflict is aiming that dag on camera conflict is the professor not like you don't hear photos oh man he's like you're three pixels off no good two stars so if if you say what the goal of a pokemon game would be it would probably be to be the champion to be eight gyms to beat the elite four to be the champion and this it is to complete the first ever pokedex um so it doesn't seem like battling is a huge focus but but wait wait wait also let me reiterate what i've had to tell probably about 20 people so far how many were on reddit zero uh mostly text messages and twitter dms and one instagram um hey instagram's becoming the messaging yeah it is it definitely is we have seen very little of this game do not make your overall complete assumption of what this game is based on what you've seen so far if we know anything about pokemon game announcements they give you a little nugget at the beginning and we're going to have a year's worth of reveals and more information yes and oh hey look it's a pixelated farfetch that's actually a surf fetch running around your computer screen yes um you can you do not know everything at this point you cannot judge this game and also just to throw in with that as well i've gotten complaints about the quality of the rendering of the graphics yes and i do want to talk about that well i was just like we historically know that they have in the past done first previews of games that were not finished yet and the graphics improve mm-hmm we don't know exactly what or more than a year in development they built this yes trailer like whatever i'm not getting into it the only thing i will point out is somebody did point out that the pattern design on your outfit is similar to the team galactic logo yeah i saw that too okay so speaking of people making exceptions i don't want to spend a lot of time on this but uh two things the first thing is when they when they do that panning shot from behind the trainer and then look at mount cornett because we know that's mount cornet somebody lined that up with the same opening trailer of breath of wild and it is one to one identical like they knew what they were doing there they wanted to capture that feeling of do you want to know what else it matches up to probably like the elder scrolls thing as well the opening shot of sound of music nice never seen that movie but i'll tell you breath of the wild the musical uh sound of music it is a big sweeping shot that was developed and shown in that film to capture the grandeur of the countryside it is not a mistake that they use it in multiple games to show off look at how huge our world is going to be like that doesn't mean anything you they're the same shot wait a minute is it not the most pokemon fan thing in the world that like what three four years ago i don't know how many whenever breath of the wild first came out all the pokemon fans were like five or six why can't we have pokemon breath of the wild i want pokemon breath of the wild we get pokemon breath of the wild and like this is not what i want no not like this i'm unhappy okay so if you go to the outreach factory expect to get outright i i do get frustrated that every game gets compared to breath of the wild but also i lived through the early 2000s where a lot of games got compared to super mario 64. rest of the wild is just the game that is on the to-do list and before breath of the wild i i'm pretty sure it was dark souls everything was compared to dark souls this plays like dark souls this is as hard as dark souls this looks like dark souls you roll like dark souls i get it it it is very exhausting though that any game coming out whether it's nintendo or not gets compared to breath of the wild um the the second point i want to make is the the open world you heard me read the press release where on the official website there's also a nintendo press release about these games but i read the official pokemon press release nowhere did they ever say the words open world with that being said does the game look open world yes i'm not going to debate that it does look open world but they chose not to use those two words yet and the only reason i bring that up is because time and time again people's expectations rise because they make these assumptions and then a game comes out and they don't meet the assumptions that the game never said but they thought a funny story is like when the when the wii u when the wii first came out this was the time where like um ps2 ps3 xbox 360 xbox whatever they all had shooting games with online and i was waiting in line to try the wii early and the one of the we launched games was a game called red steel which was a samurai game it was a shooter you could shoot and then you could swing your wiimote and it would be a sword and there was this huge group of people in front of me and we were waiting to try red steel for the very first time we wasn't out yet and they were all talking about how they couldn't wait to play this game online when shoot each other with their wiimotes and to slice each other with their wiimotes and because their assumption was well every other ps2 and xbox game and xbox like all these other shooters have online but nowhere did ubisoft uh makers of friends deal advertised that this game had online and all these like the entire 20 30 minutes they were just talking about how great the outline was going to be for red steel when it was never even talked about um so again i do think the game will probably be open world but the if the nintendo's press release the pokemon.com the japanese pokemon website the pokemon press really none of them say the words open world and it was funny because one of our viewers one of our listeners in slack went to joe cerby joe hello if you're listening i do love joe by the way joe the webmaster of cerebe went to his twitch stream the other night and said hey do you think that arceus is an open world game and he said yes of course they even said that and then his girlfriend sitting next to him she said well they never said it during the trailer which is true they never used the words open world and so you watch joe lean forward clickily clacky on the keyboard he's like i'm checking the press release and he goes oh they didn't say open world he's and then he goes well they said grand vistas yeah sure they said grand vistas but like that doesn't mean anything they did the art style is absolutely amazing from my point of view and it was funny because right before he got to that point he was having the same argument we just had which was hey pokemon fans like to make assumptions don't make assumptions because you'll build up but again it's just does this game look open world yeah sure but there are different scales of open world right like the open world wild area in sword and shield is different than breath of wild which is different than final fantasy 15. it's different than ocarina of time um that is exactly the way that i was going to put it was if you consider the wild area if you consider the crowd i would say more like crown tundra and island if you consider those to be open world then that's what you're going to get with this that this is an extension of that type of pokemon play and i did not play gears of war the new gears of war but that is an open world game but they hide the open world they they hide the fact that it's not really open world by driving a car from area to area so you have these huge areas and if you want to get to another area you're you're driving a car but it's actually hiding the fact that you can't do anything in between that from point a to point well and like right like monster hunter world right you've got very large regions that you can move around in but if you want to go from like the desert kind of region to the jungle kind of region you can't just no there's right there you have like open world maps yeah so yeah um anyways i just want to talk about that do i think the game is open world myself yes what level of open world don't know do has game freak done open world yes i think the isle of armor and crown tundra is a great example of them being able to do it and having pokemon spawn and and being able to explore with with little to no load times although it does get a little chunky um from time to time so i just wanted to bring that up um the other thing is some people were asking why are you do you not pick the cinna starters in a cinno game well because you're the one discovering the cinematographers so that one's kind of like oh i i have a sense and once again right don't take this as fact take this as will anderson's sense of interpretation is that at this time in history that we will be playing this game it's like right xeno's an island yeah wait right right uh obviously like the south north part of japan yeah which is an island um [Music] my my take is that like you are among the first humans to come and settle on this island that's why you're going out to discover all the pokemon and that's why there's not an established like hey i'm the sinnoh pokemon researcher it's like there is one village of humans maybe there's a few like outcroppings of people like intense or whatever but there's like one village of humans in sinnoh and you are there that's where you start that's why it's your base and then you will explore this in our region but you're not going to it's not going to be a bunch of towns to go from here to there so that's why another reason why why are there no sinnoh starters because right because we've just settled cino right maybe i'm just way into the pokeball design i love this thing so much are you are you guys actually excited for this game i am uh yes so i love i love anything that expands the lore and sinnoh being one of the most history-rich lore rich of the game series to be able to go back in time to really explore the history and the development of that region is incredibly exciting to me um i think everything that i've seen so far has me excited like i like the the way the world looks i like how the how they've taken what modern cinnamon was and then brought it down to historical paths like the costuming is really good the pokeball is incredible the vistas look great like everything about the game so far has me very excited to play the game like i even if the story is very basic it's just a basic exploration of what happened in the past i am very into that basic exploration of what happened in the past and i hope we get that for more regions i think it it really helps develop the world of pokemon to not always be in the present day but to also look at the past that they've never really explored before and that alone is very exciting which they talk about they talk about but we don't ever get to experience it well black and white already did this with pokemon typing adventure nobody played pokemon typing adventure okay well if they wanted the deep lore of unova unova they could have typed away it was only available in japanese no it was in the uk too you had to import it there you go uh one of our listeners is a woodworker and metal worker and has already started planning on making reproductions of the wooden yeah the wooden steam i just love that thing so much it's mostly made of wood and steam puffs from the top when it's caught it's such a it's such a great way can i can i address another complaint that i've received yes all right okay so i like how you're like oh you have nothing to say because because i am i'm thrilled and yet people love to tell me what they don't like um so i did get a complaint of oh hey do i i hate the fact i just throw pokeballs at pokemon and i don't have to battle them to weaken them and so most pokemon games they they're they're ruined they've ruined it for me and so i have once again i have two points to address uh this particular complaint number one nobody said that yeah that is not hinted at all number two if you have paid attention to pokemon in the past few years in pokemon go you do not battle pokemon before you catch them you throw balls at them in pokemon let's go you do not battle the pokemon mostly usually of the time you just throw balls at them this is a mechanic that has existed now in pokemon games for years okay so but also you can apply that to sword and shield where most people just throw a quick ball and move up with like wow they monkeyed around with the whole like if you're pokemon is not at a higher level then it's harder to catch the other pokemon yeah they that is true they play with it some but i mean the first route always catch has been for a while too like you can and a lot of games catch everything and that appears in the first round 100 of the time no battling just check a ball yeah like it's it's not that much of a stretch also we don't know what the battle system [Music] is like if you are able to if you do have to do a weakening attack and then catch it on the harder ones like we have no and that was also my response right it was like maybe the small ones you can just throw a pokeball and it will catch but maybe the larger ones you do have to have a partner pokemon to battle it and bring it down and then we catch it one screenshot of that the battle which is a glade versa guard chomp and it does have false swipe in there which is like the prime catching yeah there was i thought there was a battle scene with a strappeder and there was right but there was no attacks on that screen yeah you couldn't see what the choice is attached the glade is level 70. it has 213 hp it knows slash 20 out of 20. i'll swipe 40 out of 40. close combat 5 out of 5 aerial ace 20 out of 20 and they're against a wild guard chomp um and then there's another screenshot with like two jinxes or shinx's not jinxes i like how he catches one of them and the other one is just completely oblivious my buddy just disappeared but all right i guess this is my life now my best friend is gone i have another two things i feel like if we rename this podcast it'll be steve has two things two things one two things steve one i don't care about graphics in a video game as long as the game is good i want to really stress that like if the game looks bad but still plays super well i don't really care uh i know we can point to the trees and sword and shield that still comes up from which i think are fantastic yeah i i mean graphics can ruin a game for me but i i i would say that the art style in the pokemon legends arceus i i love the art style i love this kind of like we're doing almost like a painted brush-painted uh interpretation of the world i i think that is beautiful and and really goes along with the theme of uh this is a historical not a modern game i would say for most people as long as the game is good graphics don't matter i mean if you look at some of the top games out there minecraft it's literally blocks roblox is whatever roblox is trying to do like i mean graphics is so graphics isn't like always the make or break but if it's got really really bad graphics and there's it's okay to play then i will not like the graphic graphics are often what get me through the door like this looks super cute like there are a million board games that i bought because i just love the art and the gameplay is terrible there are a lot of games that i bought because i thought the art was really great and and you're like this game is bad but there's a lot of games where people had to convince me to buy and play the game because the art turned me off so much like i just have no interest in playing the game because i have to watch myself play it i have to be confronted with this art over and over and over again so if i really don't like the art knowing that as a visual medium this is what i have to look at that can turn me off from buying a game i i you know and i can say like my experience of that now that like thinking about it has brought this to mind right i love monster hunter games the nintendo monster hunter games they're bright they're colorful they're the weapons and everything it's fanciful and you know just you know there's like a bit of humor in there and they're just like that's a huge draw for me and then there was monster hunter world which was drab and like everything was just so like boring and it's like yeah you could tell that this weapon was made out of this particular monster's parts but it's just like not and and i lost interest in monster hunter world because it didn't have that like characteristic you know bright colorful playful nature that other monster hunter games have had so i can see like how the art style does influence my pleasure in playing the game in those ways so with the foundation laid that i'm not i don't care like if the i i think this game looks bad graphically right now right now i think it looks bad um but if the game was to ship and still look like it did today i would still buy it and play it with the hope that the gameplay is good right so that's that's all i want to say like right i do when they showed the trailer and they showed the trainer running through the very empty town with five identical buildings the only thing different was the roof um and then like this town is deserted there are five buildings they're all the same they it doesn't look great even though because something going on waking up at five o'clock in the morning before anybody else has woken up and that you oh you can't then the entire story then they show them in the field and you see like a chingling and it's like like one pixel up two pixels over two pixels it's very stuttery um the trees look just as bad as they did in sword and shield which is not a two-year-old game this is great visually it was not impressive to me and i couldn't help think about that and now i kind of feel like those people who saw sword and shield for the first time and they were like oh this why doesn't this look as good as other nintendo games but that being said like i get it the game is a year out they have plenty of time to improve yeah but it was hard for me to be excited about a game where they showed 90 seconds of in my opinion very mediocre footage i think the the the the idea the the idea that they're trying to convey got to me they're trying to do this vast um world where you can just explore you can roll seamless battles like that got through to me but it was just hard for me to be excited when i don't think that visually um this looked really like i think the very first trailer for sword and shield was a better first impression of a game freak game like i think that first trailer of sword and shield sorry seeing sir chester with the snowfall seeing that um halloween field with the yampers and the yellow grass seeing squirrel bunny on route one i i thought that actually looked great and it was really exciting and this was before the national deck so everyone was excited for that opening sword and shield um but when i looked at this game i was like wow that chingling is barely moving oh that star raptor is like stuttering in the background oh that grass doesn't over interpret man but you can't but oh but there's only like 60 seconds of footage like there's not a lot to really look at it's it still got me super excited i was like when they like for me honestly when they were doing like the hand painting of the piplup on the beach with this feels i was like i mean i mean yeah but that's not the game like i think yeah yeah i know that's not the game but still sold me on the game yeah it did yeah it's like boy they've got the right concept yeah they know what they're doing yeah like the splatters and the brush strokes and everything i get it i get it i would honestly say like for anybody who really needs a reference on this it was it was the sun and moon games i'm sure you can find a record somewhere where people have done side by side of like here is this scene from the first trailer of this game here is the scene from the last trailer of the game and you can see the improvements that they know i have no doubt that this game is going to look significantly better when it chips yeah i'm just saying as a first impression for me i saw people get really excited you know you hear statements like this is going to be the best pokemon game ever and oh my gosh they're finally doing it and some people screaming mmo even though it's not not yet not with that attitude but i'm just more optimistically cautious because if the best game at this point that we have gotten from game freak is sword and shield which i think so i think from uh like you know they already proved the open world part of sword and shield they have done some really good animations in sword and shield like hyper beam pyroball the quality of life in sword and shield is pretty much unmatched of any other pokemon game of what you can do but it's not like game freak overnight turned into rock star or turned into bungie or turned into like these these triple a studios it's still game freak and we know what game freak has we we if there's anything we know for game freak we've seen their whole catalog of video games from harmonite to uh tembo to little town hero we've seen don't forget pocket card jockey their best game by far we have we have seen every single game they have made so to go from people saying sword and shield was bad or sword and shield was not as good as diamond and pearl too this is going to be the best pokemon game it's very hard for me to be like yeah i hope i hope so i hope that this is the best pokemon game they ever do uh but from what they showed me and the rest of the world i'm just cautious about it like i i hope it's great yes that's fine yeah be cautiously optimistic that's acceptable the one of the keys of happiness is managing your expectations right yeah yeah i will also say as i know what video games i like i'm 32 years old i've played a lot of video games i know which ones i like i know which ones i don't like action rpg the first thing that comes to mind is bayonetta near automata um why am i not blight why am i blanking a devil may cry these are action rpgs that i've played before and i simply didn't like them i don't think they're bad games they're just not the type of games i like i like pokemon things so if this is a good version of that it will get me through i will probably i probably would say final fantasy xv is an action rpg i hated battle i hated the combat in that game but because i love the world of final fantasy um and because i really did enjoy the final fantasy i love the four boy band going through in their leather outfits in the desert to you know save the kingdom it really for whatever reason got to me i liked it i was very satisfied it pushed me through i'll like i think the pokemon itself will push me through but usually for me not a huge fan of action rpgs in general yeah i mean if that's the same like i don't like first person shooters but i love the bioshock series like because the story in the world of bioshock was so great that i didn't hate the fact that it was a first person shooter um so like we still don't really know what action rpg means in this context like we don't the fact that they bring up the moves but there's not like a counter or timing thing there's a lot of questions about what what they mean by action rpg and we i mean there's so little information to make a lot of judgments off of it is very premature all we know is they're going back in time there's a whole collection aspect and that that has me hooked that is a thing that i like i also hope that what was the other thing i saw like oh this is game this is game freak setting the foundation for future pokemon games didn't didn't they not like they've already proven the wild area like they've already done the open world if anything this is this is like them expanding on the open world part of the wild area uh and so what i'm saying is this is more of like them putting their stake in the ground and saying expect wild area is pokemon game not tall grass yeah and i think that's like if every if gen 9 was all wild area i'd be cool with that like i i genuinely like seeing the pokemon walk around i like being able to avoid them i i think it does make the world feel lively that's why i do like most of my time in sword and shield right now is an isle of armor i know some people like crown tundra better but i really do like the isle of armor and i like exploring it and it's it's my favorite area to wander around still and seeing those different biomes um i i hope that when i look at this trailer and it's like oh there's you only see two pokemon and there's vast canyons behind you and it's like oh gosh i hope there's something more out there uh i i hope that's there also just because the game is open world doesn't mean it's good i don't also understand this like i have played plenty of open world games that the open world part was not a necessity uh like no more heroes no more heroes too those were open world games and yeah i guess you could walk around and but there was nothing to do in it because it gives me the freedom to be me i don't have the man telling here's the bigger question do you think you get to you do you think you get to customize your trainer in uh the legend game i hope so yeah no no i don't yeah why not because there's no rules you're the first person you're gonna wear traditional garb okay you're gonna find an ursa ring you're going to carve it up with your guard chomp and then you're going to have like a like monster hunter you get aware of the ring pokemon monster hunter crossover i'm in uh final fantasy 15 i said earlier one of my favorite games ever completely open world that was probably the worst part of final fantasy 15 there was nothing to do you could you could you could walk from the the garage to the beach and it would probably actually take you two hours to walk that but there was real life nothing to do in between that's why you just took the car and the car would take 10 minutes instead of two hours i'm not even exaggerating the car would legit take 10 minutes to drive from point a to point b and you would go make a sandwich and come back and you're like yeah i'm just here with my boy bands sweating and leather in this car waiting like open where there's no there's no slimes in there i mean i'm playing gungeon impact and there's plenty of slimes in that game uh i hope this game is good though i i will never fault a video game company for trying something new they're trying something new here i i also don't expect that this is like i saw people being like talking about the sequels to this like oh this is just the foundation but i can't wait for the legends groudon or like whoa this game is a year away it's not even out yet why are we talking about sequels to this game i mean we're talking about it because much like me i would be very excited to explore the histories of all of the regions yeah yeah sure that's a very exciting thing like if this is a really good game and we're exploring the history of cinno i really then want to explore all of the other regions and that is that is an exciting idea well i mean all of them except hoenn because nobody wants to go back to well i hear that people really like kanto and want more kanto nobody wants more kanto no one we've been there five million times okay we just did a whole tour we did do a whole tour you know what's coming it's coming sooner than later though is brilliant diamond shining pearl so excited i'm so excited i believe the pokemon company partnered with uh with i love computer art i was gonna say duplo uh oh no to okay so the adventure of pokemon diamond brilliant diamond shining pro will take place in the center region rich with the nature of mount cornet towering at the heart uh you will visit many different locations to become the champion of the pokemon league uh the over the original story has faithfully faithfully been reproduced sense of scale of the original towns have been carefully preserved um you can relive familiar scenes for those setting out for cinna for the first time plenty of new encounters and surprises await the remakes include easy to understand player friendly conveniences of a modern pokemon series plus up to close personal pokemon battle scenes a couple things that they've shown they only really showed like two routes i think they showed the original route where you get your starter pokemon and then i think they showed the route where shanks and b doof spawn um they showed that first town that you go to they showed the bottom part of snow point where i think the boat is um they showed the factory the factory and they showed what looks like the underground oh they wait they showed the the blown up lake with the dead magikarp yeah they did show that yeah the best part of the game according to some people that is the best part of the game that is the surprises they were talking about um so we have to talk about the art style first that like that is the biggest point of contention whether people like it or hate it and um oh it's like i just wait i just i just love the whole it's like i want gen 4 remakes i want gen 4 remakes i watch it these are not the remakes that i'm not like this uh i will start as a person who is incredibly excited about the art style uh i love the fact that they kept the the fact that you're chibi in the overworld and full size in the battle just like in 100 100 that's 100 percent stamp stamp stamp endorsed endorsed endorsements they were like that the original games you shrunk down and you walked around the world in chibi form i think the chibi form here is incredibly cute i think it's an incredibly cute art style i i like the fact that they kept it as a as a faithful nod to the original games i i i 100 i was like i can have my nostalgia in an updated and fun to look at manner right like this is like everything i want from a remake i want it to have that same cute feel the same honestly even the same grid movement that you had in the original games i don't think there's grid because you can see dawn go sideways in the snow part i mean it looks like it looks i mean the whole layout looks like everything is squares right it's just like i am not the the words faithful remake is the thing that bothers me because like what part of it bothers you faithful would be hey do you remember 17 hms you needed to get through mount cornett well we're keeping it faithful so yeah the reason i think that they're saying that is because i i think that they really want to set the foundation for you are going to be able to capture use have access to pokemon that were available in diamond and pearl yeah no alolan pokemon no kayla's pokemon no unova pokemon that this is yeah this is a diamond pearl remake kids and you're going to get what was available in diamond in pearl i i respect that decision when they if if they if they start making a remake of any pokemon game or any game in general and they say look this is the direction we're going from day one i respect it the problem i had with auras is it wasn't a faithful it wasn't a complete faithful remake and it wasn't a complete overhauled remake like um final fantasy 7 remake is i think we i think we're mistaking faithful with exact faithful is remaining true to the original faithful is remaining in the spirit of the original there's nothing about faithful that says it's exact they never say it's exact and they even say there are life improvements in the press release like there's nothing about the word faithful that is saying this is a one-for-one complete remake it is keeping in the spirit of and true to how the original was that doesn't mean they aren't making changes that doesn't mean that we will automatically have hms that doesn't mean that the end game will won't be completely different or won't be uh from platinum it means that they are not they aren't like the plot line is going to be the same they aren't they aren't just saying now here's jordan shields dlc sinnoh like they are completely changing the game they are remaining faithful to the things that were originally part of diamond and pearl that does not exclude quality of life changes additional pokemon other things being added to the game yeah they're just part of what they're showing is they're saying very faithful to the art style of the original game like that's what like it isn't exact like it is a a new rendering of the chibi models and it is a new rendering of the world yeah but it still has the look and feel of those original games i think that's what they mean by faithful sure my worries are and they're they're they're petty but like i like customizing characters if you're saying it's faithful are we getting it are we stuck with dawn kidding yeah don and the other guy dave don and dave don and dave my two favorite pokemon protagonists uh like it is i know it's so important to people when when they play games to be themselves and in pokemon that is a game where you are yourself you are for better or worse picking your favorite pokemon going through with your journey having your experiences and to x and y that was a huge factor of being like i can be black for the first time i can be latino for the first time i can wear a hat or not wear a hat or put on a pink jacket instead of a green jacket that adds a ton of immersion for people going through a game and it was a turn off for auras for me to be like i gotta be brendan brendan's lame i'm not lame i'm cool so like you can you can remake a game like let's go pikachu let's go eevee what was that dude's name chase trace what i was saying chase tracelane but i was still able to customize myself so i didn't have to feel like chase or trace i can't even remember which one's the rival or not right if i wanted to wear a team rocket uniform and put a safari hat on my evie i could do that and that felt like me um because my eevee is always out there safariing uh so like like no character with customizations a big bummer and i feel like that's a step backwards again they already went a step backwards and omega ruby alpha sapphire omega ruby alpha sapphire was like hey we're we're going to stick you with hm's again and rock smash is not an hm but you needed rock smash to go from gym 3 to gym 4 to get to flannery and you needed it every time like that's a step back uh no pokemon in the overworld could happen probably not remember when they first showed sword and shield they did not show wandering pokemon it wasn't until the second trailer four months later where they showed wandering pokemon and we complained about that on the show we were like how can they go from let's go pikachu let's go eevee literally the best feature of let's go pikachu let's go eat and how can they take that away and i called it right you're all like no they wouldn't have a mixture and i said yes they will and you're like no they won't and i was right you were right education could they have wandering pokemon in here yeah sure they could do anything it's their video game uh but going back on that feels like i don't want that either like i i do want to walk around the zubats because we know mount cornett is full of zubats i want to not walk into them um so that i'm i'm worried in that sense is that going are these things going to prevent me from buying the game no because like i've played through sinnoh multiple times i play i think platinum is the better game like if i had a choice i'm going to platinum uh but i would miss those things a lot and i think though like those things being able to customize your character and seeing pokemon in the overworld for me adds so much immersion to a series i love well are we ready for true confession time yes i only played pokemon diamond to complete my living decks i didn't really pay attention to the story i kind of rushed it uh so this will be my first visit with actually caring diamond diamond was the first time i ever completed the pokedex like i have very fond memories of diamonds so i'm going to buy brilliant diamonds yeah i i needed to move my uh pokemon off of my pokemon emerald cartridge up so yeah that's why i played pokemon diamond i mean looking at how they do a lot of remakes i i don't think we're getting customization i don't think we're getting overworld we don't know for sure true um they like to hide those things again manage your expectations they really haven't done it a lot in the past it's highly doubtful they're going to do it here and right also keep in mind this is not the key focus of new next pokemon pokemon legends arceus is the key focus of new next pokemon this is you guys wanted remakes we paid this company to make mimics we didn't spend gold we spend silver so you get silver so at least in auras you could be unique in your secret bases yes in this game you can be unique in your underground secret bases yeah but in the the like capture the flag the tag they showed a scene of like 16 people in the what what was that that's the wi-fi room union room yeah um like that would be a great place to express yourself hey i'm the dude wearing the green hat uh yeah and you could do that in the old games you picked what your avatar was when you went into that yeah you just picked an avatar you didn't customize yourself right but that doesn't mean that you can't like then are they gonna be not gonna be a part of this the designated text that you can choose like remember they had that yeah i like happy and celebration so there there are some big questions here um the biggest question being like and this kind of goes back to why i think will is wrong about them not doing a gen 9 in the statement of like gen 8 is they have to keep pushing forward this competitive scene so how are they are they going to say hey all competitive for the 2022 world tournament is going to be in the diamond and pro remakes not made by game freak or is it going to be in sword and shield like we don't know that i don't know in the world championship so maybe that's what's the real hot take on what's happening with competitive like we're just done with competitive all together because it's not going to be legends of arceus if you go to the japanese website i think we said this earlier legends of arceus has no online multiplayer at all um diamond and pearl on the japanese website says two to four players so is diamond and pearl going to be the competitive game which maybe i mean maybe it is or is it going to be game tv freak can design the battle system what was it yeah you use this yeah what was it for auris and auras was the competitive game during the time it did go from x and y to auras yeah because because they added new megas the only time they skipped was let's go because and but they but they said when let's go came out and they literally said hey let's go is not a competitive game like they put that flag down very early on with let's go um so i yeah i don't know how they're going to do competitive with this game coming out this fall if they do stick it to sword and shield is sword and shield going to continue to get wild area updates and contests and mewtwo's appearing in raids throughout the time are they going to support both games they could they did with ultrasound ultramoon and let's go ultrasound ultramoon continued to get a new tournaments while let's go existed uh but then that's a long time right because we we got two dlcs last year we have nothing planned for this year for sword and shield this game comes out in fall are we just gonna live sword and shield battle mechanics until generation nine like i don't know um hey i don't know if if diamond and pearl are going to be the main competitive games going forward are their gen8 pokemon post game like faithful remix okay cool get to the end can i import some gen 8 pokemon can i import cramer and can i import stonejoiner can i uh the one thing i feel like i know for sure it's not been confirmed but if a company making this video game also made pokemon home i'm pretty sure those two things are going to work together no no that is that is a step too far you why why would you make that would they do that um that is that is that do it i don't think legends of arceus will have all 890 in 98 pokemon i don't think gen 4 remakes will have all 898 pokemon i think game freak and the pokemon company planted that flag and i think they're standing by it no pokemon game going forward we'll have all 898 pokemon it would boggle my mind if this game doesn't let me import a score bunny or a cramer ant or a a now cremy it would it would actually bog i like i get that you probably have to beat the game beat cynthia and then you can do it just like gen five um but it would feel very weird to not be able to take those freshly new gen8 pokemon and explore a different region with them what if they come out with something that's like pokemon they've used every good word out there like pokemon battle uh competition i don't know and it's like literally it's like links to pokemon home you can oh like a battle revolution yeah that's only about battling and it's like you can move your pokemon in from pokemon home you have to breed them develop them grow them someplace else and it's not tied to an actual adventure that would be cool i mean i could see them doing that because that really frees them up quite the competition part and and the remakes is the part i i i don't know i don't know how you solve for x in that like that is a big that is a big question mark of what how very easily what did these games i could easily see them that this competition stays in sword and shield period and that's that is until the next then their next game that they're going to lease with competition focus another thing if this is faithful remakes does that mean we're not getting synonym forms like when i think of pokemon games going forward i loved alolan forms i love gallerian forms i would like to see a new pokemon yeah i would like to see like a synonym um we got that we got mammoth we got roserade we got all of these extended evolutions you know it's not the same it is the same i want to see uh you know like a cinnonia ninkay uh cinonian um yepper come on like those are fun why would you want to take those away because i don't think they're going to tur i don't think game freak is going to turn over design of new forms and new pokemon to a third party they don't have to creatures helps with pokemon design like they work with items i don't think they're gonna necessarily do that we know that the anime team has made their own pokemon like cosmog which they forced into sun and moon like they can they can have a team of people help make 10 15 sinonian pokemon to make that feel sinnonian is such a bad it's a bad word it's a bad word i don't know what else just give me a better one that is better um but yeah that is something i look forward to in future pokemon games it's something i shouldn't expect though just because they did it for sun and moon and just because they did it for sword and shield doesn't mean every game going forward uh there was a rumor or not a rumor but um uh pokey shopper which is they have all the pokemon merchandise from japan and everything uh they did say that there are uh six new toys coming for shining shining pearl brilliant diamond and one two of those toys are mega lucario and mega charizard so people jump to the assumptions because these are branded as diamond and pro remake toys that mega charizard and mega lucario will possibly be in this game just to prove me wrong fine that's why they did it i don't know why anyone would be shocked about that it's not like when ultrasound ultramoon ended and sword and shield started they forgot about megas like they're adding new megas monthly in pokemon go pokemegas exist in the current episodes of the anime megas exist in pokemon masters i wouldn't be surprised if eventually cafe mix adds pokemon megas as well but why would that surprise anyone to be like megas would come back and everything comes back in pokemon games they they take it away and then they give it they get they give us it back eventually because dynamaxx was such a better interpretation of yeah yeah dynamics i've said this before i think the only the place that megas actually shine in is the anime i think that is the best place for megas but i think for actual competitive battle dynamaxx is better but yeah at the end of the game they could do a sun and moon they could say like at the end of the game here's the mega bracelet here's the mega stones have fun they could say at the end of the game here's one stadium where you can dynamax battle have fun like they can do whatever they want if those things are in there cool if they're not bummer but also like they're getting 60 out of us either way like there this remake i feel like has only opened up more questions than prior to it being announced because of what they showed but it's the pokemon company they're really good at holding out information and then surprising us later um i don't i didn't say this earlier i don't love the art style i like let's go pikachu let's go let's go pikachu let's go eevee's art style better um but i i guess it's like that it's back to yeah i get what they were going to do yeah which about what i what i i what i am happy is that they didn't do like the sword and shield looking scenario for diamond and pearl right and and having that art style because i honestly feel like that this is almost an admission because you know one of my big complaints about even the sun and moons and sword and shield is that the routes are too short and that well they're pretty short and cinno too well no but not not as short just like they're they're more adventuresome and that the the reason is it's a trade-off in being able to include that amount of graphics in it and that you know this allows them to maintain those the same route styles and everything and the whole confusion of mount coronet and getting through that i think that it's so smart from them from a business perspective to have these graphics so dynamically different like no one is confusing diamond report remakes with arceus they're just right so vastly different and i remember times when i was playing ultrasound ultra moon on on my twitch stream people would be like is this x and y is this omega ruby alpha sapphire um and those are like more casual fans that are asking those questions obviously like somebody who's deep into pokemon 2000 hours they're gonna be like this is definitely ultrasound ultramoon because of the health bar but if there's one thing the pokemon company has been very good at is attracting new fans to this series they've been excellent at that this is why sword and shield sold 20 million copies versus x and y only selling 16 and uh sun and moon only selling 15 they're so good at getting new people so like if somebody who is 12 or 15 or 20 or 22 if they saw sword and shield or they saw x and y and they were like those games don't look like they're for me they might look at this and go this looks great oh this is pokemon oh i'm going to try this one and a pokemon fan who goes ugh i hate the graphics but they're still gonna buy it because it's pokemon it's like a win-win for them and i mean it also helps make the game feel very distinct right like it helps set it apart it helps make it visually unique you know you know you're looking at screenshots from diamond and pearl versus screenshots from sword and shield versus screenshots from let's go like they they deliberately change the art style so that the game is easily identifiable yes and they've done this in the anime like i know the second a gen 5 anime is on because they got those thick black beyblade lines and i know when alola is on because it has those thinner more fun more zany lines and then i know when diamond and pearl anime is on because nothing is lined up all the colors are bad and may is halfway through the floor because it's poorly animated like it's very distinct did we cover that as lucas and dawn no we never really said dave it's lucas and dawn [Music] i'm excited for both games but i think i'm more excited for diamond pro just because it's coming out sooner and because i know what to expect i guess i mean i i loved i loved platinum a lot um i really did enjoy diamond and pearl a lot i i think for the first time i'm probably not buying both just because that world of having to trade with yourself doesn't exist yeah there's no proven merit to buying both yeah the so biggest shocker was game freak not working on these second biggest shocker only one version of our kiss yeah this company's really good at selling us the same game twice well but if they're i mean going back to what you've said right no online component what would be the point of having that's very true yeah um it's interesting curious of how they'll do the little watch um that had like 40 different modes there's a lot of things i i don't i don't i think they'll do some things right something's wrong i'm sure something will be annoying something will well hopefully that annoying thing is in hms um i hope mount cornett will not be mount cornett is the worst part of the game um and it's like an important part like right it's it's supposed to be if you've never played diamond and pearl what they did is they put a giant mountain in the middle of the map they called it mount cornet and in order to try verse sinnoh you have to keep cutting through this mountain and as you unlock hms which at the time kind of made sense because it was a way to gatekeep areas of the game yeah you would go through mount cornet and be like now i have strength now i have surf now i have rock climb and so you would always go back to mount cornet but mount cornett was infested with zubats infested with uh slowpokes and uh pro tip they make this item in the game called repel yeah that you could use but it also had that problem of like everyone makes a joke like you needed a b doof on your team because b doof learned four hms but the problem is like if you wanted to get to the pokemon league i'm not joking you needed minimum seven hms you could get you technically needed eight because the eighth one would have been defogged but most of us have pretty okay eyes and defog wasn't as annoying as um flash so you could get by with seven it was like surf waterfall rock slide not rock slide rock climb anyways uh but you needed seven which is like if you didn't want b doof on your team like seven moves dedicated to hm's across six pokemon and that really sucks when you're trying to go to the pokemon league because that's your final team normally it's just well no you change it up right when you get there you have you have your traveling team but even if hms are in i guess that issue is slightly alleviated if you could access your pc everywhere like in let's go and like um sword and shield because then i could just access my pc switch to be do push the rock switch back move on i mean there's a lot of ways that i mean they couldn't have gems they could have hms be like they were in sun and moon where it's tied to a specific pokemon that you call it could be that you access your pc everywhere like there's a lot of ways around it that we just who knows which one they're picking okay yeah yeah okay let's take one more break we have to talk about pokemon snap uh a little bit pokemon go question of the week pokemon of the week and then we are done there's no way you're having question of the week yeah we're gonna skip it it's like let's be real i didn't even think of a song simply because i knew there was no way you were going to allow that to happen okay we will be right back what is a nidoran supposed to be it's a mix of porcupine a rabbit dinosaurs mouse whales jackalope probably a horse and hamster porcupine a rabbit dinosaur is a mountain whales jackalope probably a horse [Music] [Music] we are back all right can we before we talk about pokemon snap no no okay never mind let's not talk about pokemon snappy they're moving on i i think look they they announced two new switch games mm-hmm both both exciting but i just thought there was going to be something more to the 25th anniversary true yeah like they like mentioned masters they mentioned cafe mix they mentioned uh pokemon go no sleep no detective pikachu no movie trailer like the new merchandise isn't even up on the store like it just felt that the 20th anniversary had way more going on think of it this way they're treating this as a full year event so this was the launching point and now we will have a year's worth of fantastic revelations every week something new we can only hope i just uh in comparison to the 20th the 20th just seemed more hype uh did you get your leons and masters no i did that uh yeah i guess i guess we could talk about pokemon masters for a hot minute they added leon to masters i have not gotten my marny it's a one percent poll yep which is the first time they've done a one percent usually a five star new character is a two percent yep um but i think leon is a 12 chance of five star overall whereas usually those banners are ten percent five star so even though leon's a one percent you have a higher chance of getting five stars they're trying to really make leon feel special it's leon he does play special yeah leon's cool it's it's overpowered in the game the hands down they've like just decided that there's no other pair that matters and they gave 6 000 gems this weekend which is extremely extremely generous they gave 3 000 for logging in on pokemon day and then they gave 3000 to celebrate the 1.5 year anniversary of pokemon masters and they say that they have two year plans so i guess pokemon masters outlives pokemon duel in that regards of lasting two years they mention cafe mix on stream so hey cafe mix is going strong i guess you're getting all those second golden acorns or whatever it was i started playing i'm level like 12. i don't love it did you join the no you have to be 22 to join i'm getting there all right i feel like what they showed of pokemon snap in the pokemon presents video really sold pokemon snap finally to me at least didn't to me oh no okay it did to me i there was only one thing that i was like i honestly don't care about this but the whole rest of it that venusaur jumping into the lake that did it for me it was cute no no i'm saying there was one thing that was like i i don't care about this this does not move me but everything else online leaderboard stuff no what didn't sell you the stickers i don't need stickers i didn't share your photos i'm not gonna put googly eyes on a dratidi know what that is so i'm on i'm on newpokemonsnap.pokemon.com brilliant web address here um you can now they they showed that you can edit your shots in new pokemon snap photos taken during your research can also be saved to your personal album which is separate than your pokemon photo decks uh when you complete a course and are about to say photos to your album you can use the resnap function to adjust brightness blur zoom and other aspects of your photo in resnap you can increase the a photo's blur and adjust a photo's point of focus you can also lighten and darken by adjusting the brightness or draw attention to your favorite part by zooming in and then there's the photo in photo editing mode you can add stickers frames filters and photos saved in your album you can also make photos stand out by adding more personal touches the nintendo switch online membership membership sold separately can complete you can compete in global leaderboards with pokemon photographers around the world in various rankings and such as pokemon photo decks score if you're a nintendo online member you can also share your photos with people around the world you can post your favorite photos and see what kind of shots people are taking so that was kind of the new thing they showed it looks like they have at least the screenshot they have trending photos they have featured course and then they have recommended so who knows if this will be a complete disaster or why would it be a disaster i don't know anytime you can give people a stylist and they can draw on their photos something can go wrong wait who said that you could you can't draw you can do stickers i mean you can put your stickers in a very interesting arrangement but yes it's limited in some way yeah i mean i think a lot of people are still worried that this game isn't worth 60 dollars worth of game yes i will say hot take this is the first pokemon professor to ever this is my dude oh really yeah i'm dating this guy okay i'm making my trip to the lent all region [Laughter] uh yeah i still i mean there was nothing more that they showed that made me think okay i'm really i'm bored now like all the things that they showed are things that i expected them to already included you can throw the luminous orb at the pokemon and it changes the color changes the color to fire like that's not very exciting uh here's the thing i'm not going to see how cute that vaporeon was when you threw it and i ate the apple and then it gets into a little smiley pose for you what what is wrong with you why do you hate goodness i don't i here's the thing my whole probably first interaction with this game will be watching one of you play it because that's really interesting to me and i don't know that i'm going to get more enjoyment out of me playing the game then say watching what if you play the game on the big screen but you can get a shiny calibey i'm pretty sure no yes oh no i don't think the celebrity was shot that was shiny um it also says wild pokemon thrive on the island of lentil region where environments can greatly differ making for a variety of habit habitats where different pokemon expressions and behaviors can be observed observed players will be able to get their attention by playing a melody which was in the original game yeah who gets all real happy throwing fluff fruit they will also be able to use illumina orbs an invention of professor mir on pokemon to witness something out of the ordinary i'm assuming that's in i'm assuming that means pester ball yeah they didn't want to use pester ball because pester ball is kind of mean yeah lights up the pokemon yeah i think it's just like insta no pastor ball where you're going to use this orb and they're going to do something cute instead of being like frustrated that you threw a smoke ball at their head um those charmanders got real mad when you threw pesky balls and apples out their heads and magikarps confirmed in the game i saw that they can even use their camera to run scans which will be helpful to find hidden pokemon or inspect their surroundings as a player keeps researching a course their research level will increase they may discover pokemon acting in different ways which is like the replayability trainers may even encounter legendary or mythical pokemon we know in the first pokemon snap there was moltres zapdos articuno um there was mew i don't think there was me too there's like mewtwo in the stars but i don't think mewtwo yeah yeah me too in this there was a shadow or it was in the star wars like the constellation yeah i i yeah i guess we'll see i mean like pokemon snap could be an awful game and they will sell millions of copies because nostalgia yeah well and plus like little kids will get a lot out of it yeah right just like the on rails component which is the detractor for me is perfectly fine for them i mean i'm not saying it's where's my switch come on man it's just it's just i don't think it's a game for me yet yeah i need to see it i need to see the replayability of it you know a lot of things are catching there's a lot of games like i still haven't completed a lot of things in sword and shield so like we'll see um i you know i i'm very interested in watching it i'm very interested in seeing how it goes and how people play the game and and watching people play and take pictures may encourage me to buy it i enjoyed the first game um i'm just not yet sold on this one although the closest they've come to selling me on this is in the edit and share on the web page the mustache on the two canon is very very good it's very good the next set of news here um oh i guess we'll talk about some pokemon go uh we did the canto tour we didn't talk about that last week because we recorded early um good news is none of us got covered well i'm still in 14 day quarantine i'm not seeing anybody hmm yeah um well i got tested i'm good so if you're around me and i was you were you're definitely around me um so we went to mall of america we played the kanto tour as somebody who went to uh all four pokemon go fests i think the kanto tour was better than all those go fest i think the things that you did um and the hour rotation change i thought was engaging and fun so i have i i what i had wished is that the first it started with everything in the wild and it ended with everything in the wild and the rotation was just in the middle because having played the whole day waiting for the rotation to come back around again was was very it was kind of frustrating it was it was super frustrating but it was like oh steve needs a jinx and that is not coming up again for another three hours yeah i knew we were going to be playing i know but from sort of a time thing i think it would have been more exciting for me to have everything spawning just there was a ton of stuff in the first couple of hours then they went to the regimented time and then they ended with everything in the wild for a couple of hours that's just me like that's the complaint i sent to them like i wish it had been open segmented open i did have a good time but i can't say that i had a better time with this one than i did at go fest um because stuff didn't have raids yeah i mean the raids were fun to a point we know when we were chasing the 400th wow time hotel room hanging out and other folks were out still doing raids you guys you guys went so it was a 12-hour event it was from nine to nine which i think is way too long it was very long and it was very wait wait wait wait we didn't give the most important update on this whole event okay i won will anderson won because i finished everything everything i thought the collection things were cute i am not mad that things were in raids uh again because we were in a location yeah where we could do a lot of raids i understand why people may have been upset for people who didn't go to a location it was a risky choice in a risky time so i get that complaint we made a different choice we took a lot of precautions to be able to make that choice so the raids were never a barrier to us um there were a lot of raids uh halfway through the day i was really sick of running into the trainers at stops and having to say no i do not want to battle you anymore which is the complaint for people who played at home they didn't see those trains and people who didn't see them i thought that was handled really weird that was like that's a part that i was like you need to tweak that a lot more uh the thing that i saw that i do agree with is like put the trainers in a balloon have the balloon come down instead of saying team rocket it says go fest uh that would help the people at home that would have a trainer standing on top of a pokemon is still super frustrating and that's what happened at the last yep um go fest uh which was like over the summer you could just play anywhere but there was still team rocket people just standing on top of pokemon that you want to tap on look i don't want to battle you right now i just want to tap on this cloister right you guys got to play like me and use your pokeball plus to put a majority of it i wasn't tapping on anything i didn't i didn't want to fill up my sp fill up my space um i thought the amount of shinies we got were good uh it the like i felt like maybe i expected the shinies to happen more in the wild than they did like i got more off of my incense than i did in the wild just running into them and that felt a little off um that being said i showed up at nine in the morning and i left at nine at night so and i had an amazingly great time i just can't attribute all of that to the event like yeah no some of it was that delicious pizza oh that was so good pizza was good um so i i think what they what i think overall it was worth the 12 bucks and we ran we ran a poll on our twitter we had like 900 people participate in it obviously those are people who listen to the show or who follow the twitter for news so they're obviously pokemon fans um but i think it was like 52 percent said it was worth it 48 said it was not i was in the investing i was in the nut and i would also i would probably assume that a lot of people that said it was not were people who played at home i would be very very curious but in a sense where we went to probably what i still think one of the best places in the united states to play wall of america uh they had eight gyms 25 poke stops yeah i think it was jim any raid tauros bell sprout there was no bell spot raids but if there was a bellsprout uh filled up instantly yeah didn't have to talk to anyone didn't have to do anything if greg got into a 20 raid will would get into his own 20 raid i would get in my own 20 raid it would just fill up it didn't it looked when we started it was not that way early in the morning like yeah i was a little worried when we first started like when you got because will and greg they kind of tapped out around 7 30ish and then me and chris continued grinding will and i had a wonderful time enjoying each other's company watching a weird chateau thing that was love horrible hgtv and neither of us cared enough to change the channel but after after like after like 7 30 in the mall of america it was it was it was still easy to get like seven eight people in your raid but it was no longer filling up like i think i think overall at least in that area people were done after 10 hours i mean it was a long day it was and i mean right for me i i don't want our listeners to think that will anderson gave up no that is 100 incorrect i literally had completed not only like the professor willow research but what is the like the today research is that just called special research or whatever special today research yeah i had completed all of that which means like i evolved every pokemon from kanto that could evolve uh yeah the only reason for me to be out with my very very tired legs continuing to walk the mall of america would be to try to get a shiny mewtwo and guess what chris didn't get a shiny mewtwo guess what steve didn't get a shot in youtube so i i i i'll get i'll show you some other day 20 20 premium raid passes for a year and a half i finally was able to spend them i mean when you when you started the kanto tour they gave you like what three four or five incense or something like that they gave you three uh remote raid passes they gave you ten or maybe nine uh daily free raid passes you could do so if in rate passes alone they gave you more than 12 worth again if you were at home you probably didn't take advantage of those um so i totally get it but in a situation where um you were out and about and you were doing raids and you were joining raids um you got your value there i think there was points they gave star pieces during some of the research as well and they gave you the shiny ditto and they gave you the rare encounters of the the snorlaxes and the lapras and the shiny odds were increased um i think it was like niantic has definitely gotten better at these events over time every event they have definitely definitely minus maybe the mr mime event but these big events that probably take a lot of planning a lot of setup um they have really knocked it out of the park i don't think though i i still think if niatik had the choice to do an irl go fest they would still do it they would do they would do this make so much more money yeah um um oh yeah let me throw that in as well not only did i win by getting all the research is complete before everybody else i completed like three other researches that i had not you yeah i was busy yeah you got a lot you had a you got a lot accomplished that day i completed everything that i wanted to do i was more than happy at the end of the day to go sit down having not walked in literally a year walking walking was uh interesting uh seeing the levi stuff in person was yeah so i don't know i think yeah look a lot better in person than they did on the website and the classic american thing we either have extra small or extra large that wasn't even extra large because i would have bought an extra large it was extra extra large is what they had left yeah i will say the negative for the day or at least one of the negatives for the day was i'm not going to name names but all you folks with your jank boy it's hard to control my language now your jank remote raids that you persisted in inviting us to over and over i appreciated it liar i think i i think i did too many raids though the problem the problem when you're in a raid is because the the problem when you're in a raid is you can't catch you can't spin i mean you can poke ball plus catch but um i spent a lot of time in raids because what would happen is somebody would invite me to a raid and i would be like uh like i haven't done a raid with them today maybe they need my help okay can we talk about something yes mmm pokemon go players frustrate me so much how can you go through the entire day the entire go fest and not bring a mega pokemon just mega evolve anything i didn't realize that i could evolve that's another research i finished that day i didn't know i couldn't because none of us none of us benefited from your mega hound doom once no never mind here's the cost benefit analysis the two seconds of the time we saved in the raid was off put by the five hours of steve going bringing them back and how do you oh yeah i'm so cool that malibu guy had like a gloom and a butterfree and i don't know what else he had but mega houndoom swept that dude so many times i only battled that dude i don't know who the dude in the pikachu outfit was or the girl in the explorer hat or the dude with the 3d glasses give me malibu because mega houndoom sweeping the floor with that guy i swept with al all the other traders with a lot of other things and what did you not hear from me the entire day mega ho doom when when my mega hound doom ran out i should have did mega gyarados though oh boy where are we sweeping with mega gyarados when i pulled that bad boy out but the point being is all these people at mall of america doing raid after raid after raid you know they're not at home easy to invite people i invited five people every time i joined in a raid and most of those people never got in because there was just so many people at mall of america that were just jumping in and it was like i saw so many people at level 41 42 43 44 these people over level 40 none of them using megas now there wasn't a mega that was perfect for every single encounter but in my s in my situation i was like well i want mewtwo i'll do as many mewtwo's as possible i'll pick a dark mega and you don't have a lot of options you got gyarados you got hound doom but you could have done like mega ampheros if you wanted to do like zapdos or not zapdos but articuno moltres um mega bee drills not good against you can do mega beat drill against me too yeah bug against me too but in the very few situations where i was mega and there was like maybe two or other three people mega there was a significant difference of like clearing up 30 seconds faster or 20 seconds faster and that was just more time getting mad at the trainer standing on top of pokemon that you can like like because we did so many raids back to back that time to me eventually added up and also like i don't know how you're level 44 and not think like just pop on a mega you're gonna get mega candy in return you're going to help out the other people it's going to be slightly easier like what what what possible other reason would you be not meg like this is the time to make if any other time existed playing for 12 hours is the best time to mega because of the gameplay we're doing like i understand not megan today if you're only maybe going to do one or two raids but in a like i don't know it just kind of felt weird to me that no one really megan anything like i would look through the roster and it's like oh no one having met this one person who is way too into megas i will never make a because i don't want to be that person every day on my twitch stream people coming in i wish they would bring megas to sword and shield y'all ain't even using them in pokemon no bring them i want to see them you couldn't see anything geez i never even pay attention to the other things that are out on the i wish i could get some boba tea man the line at the boba team plays so long tap tap tap tap tap tap mega hound finally got his servants due this weekend for years in x and y and omega ruby no one thought mega houndoom i put i put them to work yeah you told us about it none stop i'm all about the mega okay uh there is a the the season is changing in pokemon go they introduced seasons three months ago it was like the season of celebration um this is the pokemon rotation like some pokemon will never spawn when a season existed um they're gonna be rotating it come march first probably today listening to the podcast so the first season season one of pokemon go is called season of celebration this is technically the second season it's called season of legends um landorus thunderous tornadoes coming back their therian forms are coming um new mega pokemon will be coming different pokemon will be in the wild for the northern hemisphere in the southern hemisphere um different pokemon will be in eggs uh there will be season exclusive research and there will be other bonuses going forward we're not going to go through the whole thing this podcast is already way too long but we can talk more in depth we'll probably actually have more information about the season after march 1st that we can talk about and that's uh i think that's it leon marnie some those came to masters i think cafe mix had um a couple like celebi return and stuff like that there was supposed to be pokemon 25 merch it went up on the store last monday there was no pictures then it got pulled from the store it's still not up they put a 400 train on the store they put a master ball in the store master ball sold out i think the master ball was 120 dollars it was limited to 5 000 people that's gone train is still up there if you want a 400 pokemon train but the actual 25 anniversary merch never went up although i would expect it probably goes up later this week i am confident throughout this two and a half hour long podcast we have missed something but the nice thing about this podcast is it comes out every single week so true we will get to whatever we missed next week we get more information about diamond and pearl or legends we can talk about that if you have your own opinions of that stuff you can let us know on twitter discord uh youtube comments podcast comments those don't exist i lied but uh will give us our pokemon of the week last week's pokemon of the week uh uh it's a mythical from alola it's not zara aura it was in a movie takes no damage from normal or fighting type moves and i used to be scared of the creature it was based on when i was camping as a cub scout it's chat never chat why would chat chat pokemon chat takes damage from normal and fighting type moves it's marshadow it is marshmallow yes [Music] i just typed marshmallow into google marshall what do you got anything good no probably not uh that's not a lot no the pokemon is the same type combination as marshadow yeah marshado is the only pokemon who's stab combination is unresisted by any existing pokemon the only type combination to resist both ghosts and fighting is currently unused normal ghost oh there's not a normal ghost pokemon crazy well because they yeah it's like you can't be normal and a ghost you gotta pick not with that attitude marshadow is the last pokemon in alola and the pokemon sun and moon pokedex that's really bad trivia come on um [Laughter] marshadow's effort value yields two attack and one speed which is unique yeah because you're knocking out multiple mar shadows over there just like why would you the shuffle icon is very good shelf icon is good shiny shiny is bad no it's it it the shiny has never been released but the shiny is bad because it looks identical until it does that thing where it's cape comes out and then the cape is different it's like instead of green it's like purple oh so you can't tell it's shiny and tell it to keep you know when it goes into like when it uses its signature move have i ever used marsh shadow in everything um [Music] yeah uh martial's all right what about i love my shadow i think marshado's my favorite myth ago wow wow it's so cute all right this pokemon i've probably done this one before but it's been a tough week another all but forgotten pokemon an alolan pokemon that has only ever appeared in alola it chills the warm waters of the sunny islands but it is not a water type the pokemon it evolves from is also not water type one of its types is weak to the other so that it only resists bug ice and it's dark types a dark type attacks i'm sorry gotta read this more clearly this pokemon is never found in the wild you can only obtain this pokemon if you evolve another pokemon at mount laniki lanakila which is pretty far from the water who was the first person to ever obtain this pokemon there you go that should be enough okay you're never going to get it because it's like the most forgotten pokemon ever i'm sure we got smart listeners they'll figure it out i think i know which one it is uh we
