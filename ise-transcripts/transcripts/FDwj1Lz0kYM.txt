steve which (1:58 - 2:05)
of the fried rices (2:02 - 2:08)

and then they like dice it up and then (2:26 - 2:29)
they put the (2:28 - 2:32)
the the salt that's some good fried rice (2:29 - 2:34)
salsa then they make the little volcano (2:32 - 2:36)
with the onion rings man i was gonna be (2:34 - 2:36)
like (2:36 - 2:39)
chicken pork shrimp beef and he was (2:36 - 2:41)
gonna be like i don't eat fried rice (2:39 - 2:43)
because that's got a vegetable in it (2:41 - 2:46)
they do man they normally have like (2:43 - 2:48)
carrots or something you gotta eat (2:46 - 2:49)
around those (2:48 - 2:52)
they gotta you don't what you don't you (2:49 - 2:54)
can't eat a pee (2:52 - 2:56)
no i mean you maybe well like when i go (2:54 - 2:57)
to like (2:56 - 2:59)
panda express number one food the (2:57 - 3:01)
pinnacle of chinese food (2:59 - 3:04)
i um we had this discussion last week it (3:01 - 3:05)
was leanne chin (3:04 - 3:07)
leanne chan you had an option to go to (3:05 - 3:10)
lee engines and you skipped it (3:07 - 3:14)
look irene and i had delicious lianchens (3:10 - 3:16)
and you had (3:14 - 3:19)
a rocket burger of dubious quality it (3:16 - 3:20)
was not (3:19 - 3:23)
the best greg also here hi i'm here (3:20 - 3:26)
representing lee engines a local (3:23 - 3:29)
chinese fast food restaurant uh that is (3:26 - 3:31)
way better than panda express (3:29 - 3:32)
okay before we get into the pokemon news (3:31 - 3:33)
when i was standing in line at the (3:32 - 3:35)
johnny rockets the lady in front of me (3:33 - 3:36)
said (3:35 - 3:39)
hey can i get the bacon cheeseburger (3:36 - 3:41)
buttons (3:39 - 3:44)
she said can i get the bacon (3:41 - 3:48)
cheeseburger with no bake (3:44 - 3:51)
okay so i i have (3:48 - 3:55)
i okay yeah you could do that totally (3:51 - 3:58)
so the thing is i i frequent (3:55 - 4:01)
a another local uh restaurant here (3:58 - 4:02)
called blue door (4:01 - 4:05)
blue door pub yes um which has nice (4:02 - 4:06)
wings decent wings (4:05 - 4:09)
um they literally do not (4:06 - 4:13)
have a single burger on their menu (4:09 - 4:14)
that does not come with cheese (4:13 - 4:16)
automatically (4:14 - 4:20)
so i frequently have to order the kids (4:16 - 4:23)
cheeseburger without (4:20 - 4:25)
cheese because it's the only way to get (4:23 - 4:28)
a regular hamburger (4:25 - 4:32)
this is a chinese place no yes (4:28 - 4:32)
chinese restaurant and hamburgers i have (4:34 - 4:39)
never eaten adelie engines (4:36 - 4:41)
oh i mean the enchants fast food is not (4:39 - 4:43)
as good as the ulta done restaurants (4:41 - 4:44)
used to be but there's (4:43 - 4:46)
i mean they're a better quality than (4:44 - 4:47)
panda express (4:46 - 4:51)
not a high bar but still a bar that they (4:47 - 4:53)
easily clear well i will have to try (4:51 - 4:54)
them because (4:53 - 4:58)
uh my local chinese (4:54 - 4:58)
i mean this is what started it all right (4:58 - 5:02)
i was so incredibly disappointed because (5:00 - 5:03)
i ordered (5:02 - 5:07)
rice noodle soup uh with chicken (5:03 - 5:09)
and to me that means you get like a soup (5:07 - 5:11)
with rice noodles and some chicken (5:09 - 5:14)
in it and it was like literally like (5:11 - 5:14)
some (5:14 - 5:17)
wet rice noodles with like chicken and (5:14 - 5:20)
snow peas put on top (5:17 - 5:23)
quality how do you even call that a soup (5:20 - 5:25)
did they say a separate thing with broth (5:23 - 5:26)
and forget it (5:25 - 5:29)
i did buddy um (5:26 - 5:29)
we can't keep talking about chicken and (5:29 - 5:33)
rice we can (5:31 - 5:35)
i mean we can talk about chicken and (5:33 - 5:36)
rice for a long time (5:35 - 5:39)
because rice is my favorite food chinese (5:36 - 5:41)
is one of my favorite all-time (5:39 - 5:44)
cuisines is this something that greg and (5:41 - 5:46)
i have in common (5:44 - 5:48)
white rice is white rice is my favorite (5:46 - 5:50)
food in the world (5:48 - 5:53)
japanese style sticky white rice is my (5:50 - 5:55)
favorite food in the world (5:53 - 5:57)
i will oh i mean i only like chipotle (5:55 - 5:58)
because (5:57 - 6:00)
of the rice component do you know what (5:58 - 6:03)
goes great with rice (6:00 - 6:05)
kimchi (6:03 - 6:05)
okay uh let's do the pokemon 25 music (6:10 - 6:15)
first (6:14 - 6:16)

we going to give our reviews of (6:21 - 6:26)
pokemon tour uh yeah we'll do that (6:22 - 6:27)
i can't do it i think we started off (6:26 - 6:28)
with the post malone stuff because that (6:27 - 6:29)
was (6:28 - 6:31)
literally last night fresh on her mind (6:29 - 6:32)
um this (6:31 - 6:35)
is off the this is the pokemon press (6:32 - 6:36)

each release a song of the delight of (7:16 - 7:23)
fans around 25 years and pokemon is this (7:20 - 7:24)
journey (7:23 - 7:26)
and it's it's a it's a pretty boring (7:24 - 7:29)
press release but that being said (7:26 - 7:32)
uh i didn't know who jay baldwin was (7:29 - 7:36)
last night neither did i yes (7:32 - 7:40)
they are a latin american artist (7:36 - 7:44)
i believe that has won four (7:40 - 7:49)
music awards of of what type (7:44 - 7:52)
music awards from where grammys i know i (7:49 - 7:53)
was like (7:52 - 7:56)
grammys you know that kind of stuff (7:53 - 7:57)
people's choice (7:56 - 8:00)
billboard they won five billboard latin (7:57 - 8:02)
music awards (8:00 - 8:05)
four latin grammys two mtv (8:02 - 8:08)
music video awards four latin american (8:05 - 8:12)
music awards two grammy and received two (8:08 - 8:12)
grammy nov (8:12 - 8:16)
nominations and won a bunch of other (8:12 - 8:16)
stuff (8:16 - 8:22)
in latin america so uh they're 35 (8:16 - 8:26)
they have worked with bad bunny (8:22 - 8:29)
sean paul for pharrell williams rosalia (8:26 - 8:32)
cardi b um (8:29 - 8:36)
rose ross they he seriously like did (8:32 - 8:37)
something with rosalia (8:36 - 8:40)
yeah yeah yeah that's what it says those (8:37 - 8:41)
are the associated acts (8:40 - 8:44)
dj khaled (8:41 - 8:44)
uh i mean i do know most of these except (8:44 - 8:51)
for that first one you said (8:48 - 8:51)
it makes sense pokemon's a worldwide (8:51 - 8:54)
brand to have (8:53 - 8:57)
artists from around the world especially (8:54 - 8:58)
since we know that there's a big latin (8:57 - 8:59)
america (8:58 - 9:01)
um pokemon audience specifically with (8:59 - 9:02)
pokemon go i think pokemon go is (9:01 - 9:06)
huge in latin america so it makes sense (9:02 - 9:08)
for this album (9:06 - 9:10)
that will be released i'm assuming we're (9:08 - 9:11)
going to get like a (9:10 - 9:14)
japanese artist and a korean artist um (9:11 - 9:17)
maybe bts i don't know (9:14 - 9:17)
but yeah maybe some shakira (9:18 - 9:25)
oh i feel like shakira would be on the (9:22 - 9:26)
album (9:25 - 9:28)
oh yeah people like people like shakira (9:26 - 9:31)
more than katy perry right (9:28 - 9:31)
well that that's hard to say yes yeah (9:32 - 9:36)
that's a difficult (9:35 - 9:41)
territory to wander into hips don't lie (9:36 - 9:41)
i mean people like what they like and (9:42 - 9:45)
there's all different tastes for music (9:44 - 9:48)
so okay well give me give me your (9:45 - 9:51)
thoughts post malone concert (9:48 - 9:55)
so i i enjoyed it quite a bit (9:51 - 10:00)
the i don't know (9:55 - 10:03)
i mean the the overall experience i i (10:00 - 10:03)
really did (10:03 - 10:06)
like i i had fun i think that the whole (10:03 - 10:08)
way that it was animated and everything (10:06 - 10:09)
was (10:08 - 10:12)
like what they chose for the animations (10:09 - 10:13)
was (10:12 - 10:17)
great the fun you know the gyarados was (10:13 - 10:19)
really exciting and entertaining and the (10:17 - 10:20)
different like the (10:19 - 10:23)
the stampeding poditas or rapidashes (10:20 - 10:26)
going across the plains whatever (10:23 - 10:28)
my my biggest reaction to the actual (10:26 - 10:29)
post malone though was (10:28 - 10:32)
like uh i think the best way to say it (10:29 - 10:33)
is i guess (10:32 - 10:35)
hands really are difficult to draw (10:33 - 10:37)
because there was something (10:35 - 10:40)
wrong with the hands on that cgi (10:37 - 10:44)
character there i don't think i noticed (10:40 - 10:46)
like they they're not good at drawing (10:44 - 10:47)
humans they're really good at drawing (10:46 - 10:48)
pokemon but not (10:47 - 10:52)
humans um (10:48 - 10:55)
yeah i will uh i will give pokemon props (10:52 - 10:56)
for making this (10:55 - 10:58)
an event uh and they really did hype it (10:56 - 11:00)
up (10:58 - 11:02)
and i was really excited i streamed it (11:00 - 11:03)
even though (11:02 - 11:05)
i streamed it in a way where it was okay (11:03 - 11:06)
to stream it which was (11:05 - 11:08)
hey you can look at my face (11:06 - 11:11)
[Music] (11:08 - 11:14)
and on a different tab watch post below (11:11 - 11:15)
right (11:14 - 11:18)
because i i which i didn't do because i (11:15 - 11:19)
was doing other things but i did watch (11:18 - 11:21)
the post malone concert (11:19 - 11:26)
after yeah and um (11:21 - 11:30)
we had a lot of people in stream (11:26 - 11:32)
and very excited and then all of a (11:30 - 11:34)
sudden four songs later he was like (11:32 - 11:35)
thank you (11:34 - 11:38)
have a good night yeah yeah it was (11:35 - 11:38)
longer (11:38 - 11:42)
i had i have a couple things one sort of (11:38 - 11:43)
had (11:42 - 11:44)
thought there might be more actual (11:43 - 11:46)
pokemon (11:44 - 11:50)
music and not here three post malone's (11:46 - 11:52)
hits and the weird cover of hoodie and (11:50 - 11:55)
the blowfish that he made (11:52 - 11:57)
sort of pokemon related pokemon it has (11:55 - 11:59)
pokemon music in it yes (11:57 - 12:02)
music in it but what does that song have (11:59 - 12:04)
to do with (12:02 - 12:05)
i don't think that song itself has to do (12:04 - 12:07)
anything m2m's (12:05 - 12:08)
uh song didn't have anything to do with (12:07 - 12:10)
pokemon back in (12:08 - 12:13)
99 yeah i mean it's just it's just (12:10 - 12:15)
was i just sort of like oh it's these (12:13 - 12:17)
four songs well because it's like (12:15 - 12:20)
because when remember when ash and (12:17 - 12:22)
pikachu were dying because martial (12:20 - 12:24)
powered up the evil pokemons and they (12:22 - 12:25)
and and (12:24 - 12:28)
that poke pikachu turns to ash and says (12:25 - 12:31)
i just want to be with you (12:28 - 12:32)
right because that's why he wouldn't go (12:31 - 12:34)
in the ball so like i only want to be (12:32 - 12:35)
with you (12:34 - 12:38)
there you go i answered the mystery okay (12:35 - 12:40)
only like two years later (12:38 - 12:44)
it's a long scan it was a long scam (12:40 - 12:46)
i loved the backgrounds uh there was an (12:44 - 12:47)
entire (12:46 - 12:50)
section where he walked with his hand on (12:47 - 12:52)
his hip that looked exactly like rosalia (12:50 - 12:52)
from (12:52 - 12:56)
uh coliseum i was very into that (12:52 - 12:59)
uh i found his pants animation (12:56 - 13:00)
i couldn't tell if they were supposed to (12:59 - 13:04)
be plastic or leather (13:00 - 13:05)
slightly yeah they were slightly (13:04 - 13:07)
distracting (13:05 - 13:10)
uh i liked like all the backgrounds like (13:07 - 13:13)
the world they did was amazing it's just (13:10 - 13:16)
i felt like there should either be more (13:13 - 13:17)
songs (13:16 - 13:20)
or i guess i just wasn't (13:17 - 13:23)
expecting a post malone concert set in (13:20 - 13:25)
the pokemon world (13:23 - 13:27)
yeah that's exactly what they advertised (13:25 - 13:29)
was a stronger connection (13:27 - 13:33)
there wasn't i didn't i enjoyed it uh (13:29 - 13:36)
mostly but what saved it was jigglypuff (13:33 - 13:37)
at the end that (13:36 - 13:42)
100 saved that entire experience for me (13:37 - 13:44)
i i i didn't think it needed saving i i (13:42 - 13:46)
enjoyed the whole thing but i will say (13:44 - 13:49)
that jigglypuff at the end (13:46 - 13:50)
the worst part about the whole thing is (13:49 - 13:52)
just how short it was like that was (13:50 - 13:55)
really short which was fine i like i i (13:52 - 13:58)
don't know that i could have taken (13:55 - 14:00)
i thought it was going to be at least (13:58 - 14:01)
like 45 minutes (14:00 - 14:03)
i don't know that i could have watched (14:01 - 14:05)
that foreign oh i could have the (14:03 - 14:06)
backgrounds were awesome (14:05 - 14:10)
like i mean not being a huge post malone (14:06 - 14:11)
fan i was like oh i've heard this song (14:10 - 14:13)
before i didn't know it was his song (14:11 - 14:15)
like no i know the week before i did (14:13 - 14:16)
look up a couple of his songs and i was (14:15 - 14:18)
like oh yeah i've heard this before in (14:16 - 14:19)
like a commercial (14:18 - 14:21)
in and out of my brain so part of the (14:19 - 14:23)
problem is i think (14:21 - 14:25)
number one like post malone to start (14:23 - 14:27)
with was an odd choice because (14:25 - 14:30)
not a g rated pg (14:27 - 14:34)
13 even rated performer (14:30 - 14:35)
right the majority of post malone's (14:34 - 14:38)
music is not for the general public's (14:35 - 14:39)
consumption (14:38 - 14:46)
go out radio edits okay yeah yeah (14:39 - 14:46)
right like like circles is not circles (14:46 - 14:50)
does have (14:49 - 14:53)
a couple spicy spices it has a couple of (14:50 - 14:55)
blue moments in it yes (14:53 - 14:58)
but my expectation okay so i i would say (14:55 - 14:59)
like (14:58 - 15:01)
my high level expectation was that it (14:59 - 15:02)
would be like (15:01 - 15:04)
you would get to a certain point and be (15:02 - 15:06)
like and here's katy perry and then katy (15:04 - 15:07)
perry would do a song (15:06 - 15:11)
yeah yeah katy perry is involved right (15:07 - 15:14)
but at the very least to have (15:11 - 15:17)
like one or two other artists perform (15:14 - 15:18)
songs (15:17 - 15:22)
as well and yeah just like (15:18 - 15:24)
there was at least one other artist on (15:22 - 15:25)
that stage (15:24 - 15:28)
and they didn't let that artist perform (15:25 - 15:29)
i really thought he was going to be (15:28 - 15:31)
honest on that stage okay (15:29 - 15:33)
even though he he did four songs um (15:31 - 15:35)
because that's what they tweeted the the (15:33 - 15:36)
the (15:35 - 15:39)
the set list um he did four songs (15:36 - 15:40)
i really thought he was gonna do like (15:39 - 15:42)
one pokemon song like the pokemon theme (15:40 - 15:44)
song or something (15:42 - 15:45)
not like not maybe the poker wrap cause (15:44 - 15:47)
that's a little corny but (15:45 - 15:51)
um i thought there would be at least (15:47 - 15:55)
one remake like (15:51 - 15:57)
like he already did a cover i thought oh (15:55 - 15:59)
you they'll do another cover of another (15:57 - 16:01)
one of the famous songs and that just (15:59 - 16:02)
didn't happen (16:01 - 16:04)
so i think that's what made me feel (16:02 - 16:05)
weird about the whole thing because it (16:04 - 16:08)
was just like (16:05 - 16:11)
the only reason i'm attending a post (16:08 - 16:13)
malone concert a thing i don't have any (16:11 - 16:13)
interest in (16:13 - 16:17)
is for pokemon backgrounds yeah (16:13 - 16:19)
i could see if you're not a fan of his (16:17 - 16:20)
music you're just like (16:19 - 16:23)
oh there's charizard there's flying (16:20 - 16:24)
around (16:23 - 16:26)
there's slugma there's no the there's (16:24 - 16:27)
the best (16:26 - 16:29)
umbreon bop into the music which is the (16:27 - 16:31)
highlight of that whole song (16:29 - 16:34)
yeah no no no no no no the (16:31 - 16:38)
the shanatics oh yeah the [ __ ] actually (16:34 - 16:40)
there was a lot the backgrounds were (16:38 - 16:41)
great but again that almost made it to (16:40 - 16:43)
pokemon of the week here (16:41 - 16:45)
that's how good those those genetics (16:43 - 16:47)
were i don't know who animated it but it (16:45 - 16:49)
was really well animated (16:47 - 16:51)
um and for better for i don't know i (16:49 - 16:53)
think it was animated (16:51 - 16:54)
better than it should have been like i (16:53 - 16:56)
had pretty low expectations and they (16:54 - 16:59)
kind of went all out on the animation (16:56 - 17:01)
side but i also feel like they were like (16:59 - 17:03)
we have a budget and the team was like (17:01 - 17:05)
okay cool (17:03 - 17:09)
okay we we ran out of budget so uh (17:05 - 17:11)
like we could only maybe do like 14 (17:09 - 17:12)
minutes we were aiming for an (17:11 - 17:16)
hour but uh we could only animate 14 (17:12 - 17:17)
minutes we're out of money (17:16 - 17:19)
i don't know it kind of that makes me (17:17 - 17:21)
like think of back (17:19 - 17:23)
and of course only greg will understand (17:21 - 17:25)
me when i say this (17:23 - 17:27)
abc news paid to have a computer (17:25 - 17:29)
animation of the earth (17:27 - 17:32)
spinning as the intro to abc news and (17:29 - 17:35)
whatever company was paid to do it had (17:32 - 17:36)
the earth spinning in the wrong (17:35 - 17:38)
direction in the wrong direction (17:36 - 17:42)
forever they could never cost so much (17:38 - 17:47)
money to make it fix it (17:42 - 17:50)
[Music] (17:47 - 17:53)

of exploring while catching pokemon and (21:35 - 21:39)
filling a pokedex has always been a core (21:37 - 21:41)
part of a pokemon video game series (21:39 - 21:44)
pokemon legends arceus was developed to (21:41 - 21:47)
with the desire to deliver an experience (21:44 - 21:49)
infused with a new action (21:47 - 21:51)
and rpg elements that go beyond the (21:49 - 21:53)
framework established thus far (21:51 - 21:55)
while honoring the core gameplay of past (21:53 - 21:57)
pokemon titles (21:55 - 21:59)
as trainers explore the natural expanses (21:57 - 22:01)
in pokemon legends arceus they will (21:59 - 22:03)
encounter pokemon (22:01 - 22:06)
that call these grand vistas home to (22:03 - 22:08)

near a wild pokemon players will (22:20 - 22:24)
seamlessly enter a battle (22:22 - 22:26)
the new gameplay angle is intended to (22:24 - 22:27)
provide trainers with an immersive (22:26 - 22:28)
experience (22:27 - 22:31)
pokemon legends arceus brings trainers (22:28 - 22:31)
to the vast (22:31 - 22:34)
sino region as it existed in the past (22:31 - 22:36)
long before setting (22:34 - 22:37)
diamond and pearl long before the (22:36 - 22:39)
setting of diamond and pearl were (22:37 - 22:39)
established (22:39 - 22:42)
rich in nature and with mount coronet (22:39 - 22:43)
towering at its heart (22:42 - 22:45)
this is sinnoh unlike anything trainers (22:43 - 22:47)
have experienced (22:45 - 22:49)
as they embark to create the region's (22:47 - 22:51)
first pokedex (22:49 - 22:52)
as they start off their adventure (22:51 - 22:53)

encountered them on the research (23:01 - 23:07)
to these various regions i don't (23:03 - 23:10)
spoilers for this game rowlet evolves (23:07 - 23:11)
into deciduous (23:10 - 23:14)
and evolves into typology we know the (23:11 - 23:14)
final evil (23:14 - 23:18)
evolutions um and then finally the new (23:14 - 23:19)
pokemon snap (23:18 - 23:21)
was announced a video game that takes (23:19 - 23:23)
the role of budding (23:21 - 23:24)
pokemon photographer in the lentil (23:23 - 23:27)
region they will work with professor mir (23:24 - 23:29)
the region's expert the game will be (23:27 - 23:30)
available (23:29 - 23:33)
on april 30th i actually don't think (23:30 - 23:34)
this press release says anything new but (23:33 - 23:37)
we did see new things in the um (23:34 - 23:42)
what how is lentil spelled l-e-n-t-a-l (23:37 - 23:45)
yep oh lentil because i can't all i (23:42 - 23:47)
could think of was like the little (23:45 - 23:49)
like the little bean of bean pea things (23:47 - 23:50)
yeah (23:49 - 23:52)
they're real tasty okay we're going to (23:50 - 23:54)
be like all over the place here (23:52 - 23:56)
um because you're going to keep us (23:54 - 23:57)
organized (23:56 - 23:59)
yeah yeah yeah follow the outline we (23:57 - 24:01)
didn't make i feel like the actual (23:59 - 24:03)
biggest news from this entire event (24:01 - 24:04)
isn't the isn't (24:03 - 24:07)
diamond and pro remakes that's like (24:04 - 24:08)
saying that the (24:07 - 24:10)
the sun will set every day that's true (24:08 - 24:12)
we we all know it's going to happen (24:10 - 24:16)
um pokemon arceus (24:12 - 24:18)
isn't that surprising since we've known (24:16 - 24:19)
for quite a while (24:18 - 24:22)
that they've had that the rpg elements (24:19 - 24:22)
were (24:22 - 24:25)
being worked on i remember we on the (24:22 - 24:26)
show we covered like oh they're copying (24:25 - 24:28)
the yokai watch system or oh they're (24:26 - 24:30)
copying digimon cyber sleuth system like (24:28 - 24:31)
that was (24:30 - 24:34)
a very loose rumor i think the biggest (24:31 - 24:36)
news is (24:34 - 24:40)
game freak is using another studio (24:36 - 24:44)
to make a main series pokemon game well (24:40 - 24:48)
that's part of it but i i kind of have (24:44 - 24:52)
like my spider sense intuition of why (24:48 - 24:56)
that is happening um (24:52 - 24:59)
which is what i mean which is what (24:56 - 25:02)
i okay so this is my overall fear this (24:59 - 25:04)
is my overall theory of what we saw (25:02 - 25:07)
tell me why i love computer art the (25:04 - 25:09)
company (25:07 - 25:10)
i love computer artists that's really (25:09 - 25:15)
what it's doing i lca says her i like (25:10 - 25:15)
gather your thoughts well we can um (25:16 - 25:19)
gather them up i do have this nintendo (25:20 - 25:23)
life (25:23 - 25:26)
uh some history about ilka the japanese (25:23 - 25:27)
studio working so this will be our first (25:26 - 25:28)
part of the podcast we're going to talk (25:27 - 25:30)
about ilka (25:28 - 25:31)
which will probably lead into these two (25:30 - 25:34)
games um (25:31 - 25:36)
ilka is a japanese studio headquartered (25:34 - 25:38)
a headquartered (25:36 - 25:41)
in tokyo in the shinjuku distr (25:38 - 25:43)
uh they have three offices they have one (25:41 - 25:45)
in shinjuku (25:43 - 25:49)
naga and (25:45 - 25:52)
naganeta and then kyoto it was (25:49 - 25:53)
established (25:52 - 25:56)
in october of 2010 they are cg (25:53 - 25:58)
based video company with a with a focus (25:56 - 25:59)
on animation (25:58 - 26:02)
uh movies and television and then they (25:59 - 26:04)
incorporated video games (26:02 - 26:06)
after the fact and as of 2020 they have (26:04 - 26:08)
288 employees (26:06 - 26:11)
and i believe uh gamefreak had around (26:08 - 26:14)
250 employees during the development of (26:11 - 26:16)
sword and shield so it's no surprise (26:14 - 26:17)
that (26:16 - 26:20)
the games look very much like the mewtwo (26:17 - 26:23)
the new mewtwo movie the cgi one that we (26:20 - 26:24)
never (26:23 - 26:27)
got as far as i remember ilka stands for (26:24 - 26:30)
that coming did they come to netflix (26:27 - 26:31)
maybe it did yeah the the mewtwo movie (26:30 - 26:32)
came to netflix (26:31 - 26:34)
uh ilka stands for i love computer art (26:32 - 26:37)
computer i already covered that (26:34 - 26:39)
that was not a joke by greg that's (26:37 - 26:42)
actually what it stood for (26:39 - 26:42)
uh they did work on pokemon home (26:42 - 26:50)
um and they have worked (26:47 - 26:53)
on regular games augmented reality (26:50 - 26:55)

they are also associated with when they (27:01 - 27:04)
say associated with (27:03 - 27:06)
in this article i'm this article is from (27:04 - 27:08)
nintendo life by the way i'm not sure if (27:06 - 27:10)
that means they were the main developer (27:08 - 27:11)
i don't think so (27:10 - 27:15)
um but it says they they assisted and (27:11 - 27:18)
uh with yakuza 0 dragon quest 11 (27:15 - 27:22)
near automata naruto ship was my naruto (27:18 - 27:22)

4. and east combat cs7 (27:26 - 27:34)
yo going from ace combat to pokemon (27:30 - 27:36)
uh and that's that's pretty much it (27:34 - 27:37)
that's you know they've worked on their (27:36 - 27:39)
games they worked on pokemon home which (27:37 - 27:42)
that's not a that's not a real good (27:39 - 27:43)
thing that's not a star (27:42 - 27:44)
thing to have on your resume but it is a (27:43 - 27:46)
thing uh (27:44 - 27:49)
okay so going back to will your thoughts (27:46 - 27:50)
on (27:49 - 27:52)
ilka all right i think let me put it (27:50 - 27:53)
this way (27:52 - 27:56)
um and what i i may make a statement (27:53 - 27:57)
here that we then have to come back to (27:56 - 27:58)
later (27:57 - 28:01)
number one i now accept (27:58 - 28:06)
that it is (28:01 - 28:09)
uh unlikely no i'm not gonna put it that (28:06 - 28:10)
way (28:09 - 28:11)
here's what i'm putting together in my (28:10 - 28:14)
head the exact (28:11 - 28:17)
thing that who was the guy who was not (28:14 - 28:18)
not the president of pokemon but the (28:17 - 28:20)
other guy who was doing the presentation (28:18 - 28:22)
that guy (28:20 - 28:25)
is she how's that guy no no no no no no (28:22 - 28:27)
the the younger guy oh the second guy (28:25 - 28:28)
that came through yeah (28:27 - 28:30)
i don't remember what he was that was (28:28 - 28:31)
the first time i feel like he was ever (28:30 - 28:32)
in a direct (28:31 - 28:34)
i that's why i can't like think of his (28:32 - 28:35)
name um (28:34 - 28:38)
so what he specifically said when they (28:35 - 28:39)
announced (28:38 - 28:42)
uh the pokemon legends arceus right (28:39 - 28:45)
he said a new era of pokemon games (28:42 - 28:47)
begins (28:45 - 28:50)
specifically specifically what they said (28:47 - 28:50)
so (28:50 - 28:54)
from my perspective the piece of (28:50 - 28:57)
having a different company (28:54 - 29:01)
do the remake or update uh it's not an (28:57 - 29:02)
update it's just (29:01 - 29:05)
almost like it's a re-skinning almost of (29:02 - 29:07)
diamond and pearl (29:05 - 29:10)
and having them then make that statement (29:07 - 29:12)
a new era of pokemon games (29:10 - 29:15)
begins i take that as (29:12 - 29:19)
pokemon the main pokemon game freak (29:15 - 29:21)
creatures pokemon company international (29:19 - 29:23)
whoever else is in that mix (29:21 - 29:24)
they don't want to do these kinds of (29:23 - 29:26)
games anymore i don't think that's (29:24 - 29:30)
it that let me finish my statement okay (29:26 - 29:33)
okay and they will (29:30 - 29:36)
outsource those games to companies (29:33 - 29:39)
that they can trust that will take the (29:36 - 29:41)
ip that already exists (29:39 - 29:44)
and that you know if we are going to get (29:41 - 29:46)
a gen 5 remake it's going to be the same (29:44 - 29:47)
kind of thing it'll be (29:46 - 29:50)
some other company that will take the (29:47 - 29:50)
core (29:50 - 29:53)
property and you know update it for (29:50 - 29:55)
whatever system it's going to appear on (29:53 - 29:58)
um and then the pokemon company is going (29:55 - 29:58)
to focus (29:58 - 30:01)
and it's going to be just like this step (29:58 - 30:03)
by step that we've been taking (30:01 - 30:06)
of you know wild area all right let's do (30:03 - 30:08)
something that's all wild area (30:06 - 30:10)
okay now it's like the entire game is (30:08 - 30:11)
wild area (30:10 - 30:14)
um and we want it to be more of this (30:11 - 30:18)
mmo rpg looking type thing (30:14 - 30:21)
rather than the you are on rails in this (30:18 - 30:24)
story you've got to go jim jim jim jim (30:21 - 30:25)
jim (30:24 - 30:28)
defeat and then see whatever other story (30:25 - 30:29)
big bad (30:28 - 30:31)
evil is there okay we gotta move away (30:29 - 30:32)
from mmo rpg (30:31 - 30:35)
or open world game is not automatically (30:32 - 30:36)
better than (30:35 - 30:38)
a game that is linear like i don't know (30:36 - 30:39)
why i didn't i didn't say better or (30:38 - 30:40)
worse (30:39 - 30:42)
i just said they don't want to do linear (30:40 - 30:44)
game anymore (30:42 - 30:46)
so that's why they said a new era is (30:44 - 30:47)
beginning because it's like (30:46 - 30:48)
we're going to be doing breath of the (30:47 - 30:51)
wild we're not going to be doing (30:48 - 30:55)
i mean they did pokemon quest i i don't (30:51 - 30:56)
buy the theory that like (30:55 - 30:58)
they're tired of doing pokemon i think (30:56 - 31:00)
the the actual (30:58 - 31:02)
so so if we were to go back to (31:00 - 31:04)
complaints prior to sword and shield the (31:02 - 31:07)
complaint was like (31:04 - 31:09)
this game is rushed why doesn't game (31:07 - 31:11)
freak hire more people (31:09 - 31:13)
why why are they rushing this game i (31:11 - 31:15)
wish they didn't come out with pokemon (31:13 - 31:16)
games every year they should take their (31:15 - 31:17)
time (31:16 - 31:20)
like pokemon games are coming out every (31:17 - 31:22)
year and like this is why they're bad (31:20 - 31:23)
like these are all like the complaints (31:22 - 31:24)
you normally read (31:23 - 31:26)
and instead of game freak just hiring (31:24 - 31:28)
more people which is one (31:26 - 31:30)
not easy to what not easy for a lot of (31:28 - 31:32)
things you gotta find people you gotta (31:30 - 31:33)
have a place for those people you gotta (31:32 - 31:35)
train those people like it's just not (31:33 - 31:37)
something that happens overnight (31:35 - 31:39)
um but also as a company maybe they just (31:37 - 31:40)
don't wanna hire more people like (31:39 - 31:42)
as a company they might be content with (31:40 - 31:44)
like we have 200 (31:42 - 31:45)
some people working here we don't want (31:44 - 31:47)
250 because (31:45 - 31:49)
they don't have to right like they're a (31:47 - 31:50)
private company they don't need to do (31:49 - 31:52)
that if they don't want to (31:50 - 31:54)
but what's better than hiring more (31:52 - 31:55)
people how about we just have a whole (31:54 - 31:57)
another studio (31:55 - 31:59)
yeah making a game and i don't think (31:57 - 32:00)
like if you look at other (31:59 - 32:02)
game developers like uh like call of (32:00 - 32:04)
duty they have two people working on (32:02 - 32:06)
different games so they have enough time (32:04 - 32:07)
to put out call of duty every year but (32:06 - 32:09)
that is that doesn't mean that either (32:07 - 32:11)
studio hates working on call of duty (32:09 - 32:13)
i don't think that game freak in general (32:11 - 32:16)
is like oh we're we're so sick of making (32:13 - 32:17)
linear pokemon they made pokemon quest (32:16 - 32:18)
and it was like one of the most (32:17 - 32:20)
delightful games ever and it was (32:18 - 32:23)
very unique to what they've done before (32:20 - 32:24)
what i think that's (32:23 - 32:27)
i'm between i'm starting a little bit on (32:24 - 32:29)
wilson what i think (32:27 - 32:31)
what they're pointing out is things like (32:29 - 32:33)
remakes things where the game is already (32:31 - 32:34)
established (32:33 - 32:35)
things where they don't need to push in (32:34 - 32:36)
a new direction they don't need to (32:35 - 32:40)
design new pokemon they don't need to (32:36 - 32:42)
like remakes are already established (32:40 - 32:43)
they have (32:42 - 32:45)
what's in those games they have a huge (32:43 - 32:48)
pool of already established (32:45 - 32:51)
assets i think what they're saying is we (32:48 - 32:52)
are now (32:51 - 32:55)
freeing ourselves from keeping that (32:52 - 32:56)
in-house (32:55 - 32:58)
and and allowing other companies to take (32:56 - 32:59)
on (32:58 - 33:01)
the remakes and other things that use (32:59 - 33:02)
existing act (33:01 - 33:05)
you know assets and we are now going to (33:02 - 33:07)
focus much more on (33:05 - 33:09)
what we're going to make in the future (33:07 - 33:11)
the new games that are coming yeah new (33:09 - 33:12)
gens then (33:11 - 33:14)
something transformative yeah mechanics (33:12 - 33:15)
i mean other (33:14 - 33:16)
other nintendo studios and other studios (33:15 - 33:18)
in general have resourced out their (33:16 - 33:19)
older games (33:18 - 33:22)
so they can keep working on new games (33:19 - 33:23)
like hey yeah and i think that's what (33:22 - 33:25)
they were talking about i think they're (33:23 - 33:26)
stating (33:25 - 33:28)
like this is our first time we're going (33:26 - 33:30)
to give an entire remake to a different (33:28 - 33:31)
company and that's probably what we're (33:30 - 33:33)
going to do going forward (33:31 - 33:34)
because we don't need to remake those (33:33 - 33:36)
games right we are now going to make the (33:34 - 33:37)
gen 9 the gen (33:36 - 33:39)
10 and that doesn't mean that they (33:37 - 33:40)
aren't going to make (33:39 - 33:42)
other games like conquest i think (33:40 - 33:44)
they're still going to be the ones that (33:42 - 33:46)
are going to push (33:44 - 33:47)
they're they're going to be the ice (33:46 - 33:49)
breaker right they're going to be the (33:47 - 33:50)
ship that's in front (33:49 - 33:53)
deciding what the path is and they'll (33:50 - 33:54)
hire people (33:53 - 33:56)
to take care of the stuff that that's (33:54 - 33:58)
been established (33:56 - 34:00)
uh but i still think game freak and all (33:58 - 34:02)
that is still going to be (34:00 - 34:05)
the main driver of what new will come in (34:02 - 34:05)
the game series (34:05 - 34:08)
but i i agree but i i would say slightly (34:05 - 34:09)
differently from that (34:08 - 34:11)
um the the two things i would say that (34:09 - 34:12)
are slightly different from that (34:11 - 34:14)
the number one the diamond and pearl (34:12 - 34:16)
remakes are not boris (34:14 - 34:19)
right brilliant diamond i don't even (34:16 - 34:21)
know what the pro one is because (34:19 - 34:23)
they just said shiny pearl yeah it's not (34:21 - 34:24)
it's not oris right (34:23 - 34:27)
they are not taking and this is some (34:24 - 34:28)
complaints that i've received from (34:27 - 34:29)
people right (34:28 - 34:30)
they're not taking the current state of (34:29 - 34:32)
the game they're not taking sword and (34:30 - 34:34)
shield and then (34:32 - 34:37)
using that as like the template on or (34:34 - 34:38)
using diamond pearl as a template for (34:37 - 34:40)
sword and shields type mechanics there's (34:38 - 34:42)
not going to be a wild area around mount (34:40 - 34:43)
coronet right right right right right (34:42 - 34:43)
right right right right right right (34:43 - 34:43)
right right right right right right (34:43 - 34:43)
right right right right right right (34:43 - 34:43)
right right right right right right (34:43 - 34:44)
right right we don't know it's not good (34:43 - 34:47)
there could be we don't i think that (34:44 - 34:48)
they made it like they (34:47 - 34:51)
said so many times you (34:48 - 34:55)
you will recognize yes all these (34:51 - 34:56)
different pieces (34:55 - 34:59)
i i think what they mean by (34:56 - 35:02)
conveniences for like updated (34:59 - 35:03)
conveniences is like (35:02 - 35:06)
probably no hms yeah yeah right (35:03 - 35:08)
yeah updated convenience is probably no (35:06 - 35:10)
hms the pc is with you everywhere (35:08 - 35:13)
uh rare candy level 100 trick where you (35:10 - 35:15)
can evolve like every quality of life (35:13 - 35:16)
they did in certain (35:15 - 35:18)
shield um right those kinds of things (35:16 - 35:21)
but yeah but i doubt we'll see dynamaxx (35:18 - 35:23)
i doubt we'll see mega evolution (35:21 - 35:25)
it's going to be like what was available (35:23 - 35:26)
in the diamond and pearl (35:25 - 35:29)
world is what will be available i i (35:26 - 35:30)
don't know about that like they could (35:29 - 35:31)
have just one (35:30 - 35:32)
arena at the end of the game where you (35:31 - 35:34)
can just dynamax in they could just (35:32 - 35:37)
i mean i i'll put my money down i will (35:34 - 35:38)
be shocked (35:37 - 35:40)
they i think they may add they may add (35:38 - 35:41)
those things (35:40 - 35:43)
post game like they did for a lot of (35:41 - 35:44)
things like sun and moon (35:43 - 35:46)
like sun and moon had mega after you (35:44 - 35:48)
completed the game they may add in (35:46 - 35:50)
dynamics and it's not like you're dying (35:48 - 35:52)
to maxing on a route or you're dynamic (35:50 - 35:54)
in the wild there you're specifically (35:52 - 35:56)
dynamic in set locations like it's way (35:54 - 35:58)
easier to control than (35:56 - 36:01)
the other half of what i believe about (35:58 - 36:02)
this (36:01 - 36:04)
is and and right you don't have to agree (36:02 - 36:06)
with me there's and there's literally no (36:04 - 36:07)
science to be done here (36:06 - 36:10)
i disagree we will not show you until (36:07 - 36:11)
the future occurs (36:10 - 36:14)
but i honestly believe that this is (36:11 - 36:17)
them saying we will not be doing these (36:14 - 36:18)
kinds of games (36:17 - 36:22)
at all anymore i mean that that's right (36:18 - 36:25)
though no yeah i guess (36:22 - 36:28)
i'm very happy (36:25 - 36:31)
game freak is like we have 250 people (36:28 - 36:33)
and we know that game freak has two (36:31 - 36:34)
teams they have an a team in the b team (36:33 - 36:36)
and during the development of sword and (36:34 - 36:37)
shield they said the a team was working (36:36 - 36:38)
on (36:37 - 36:40)
well they specifically said the a team (36:38 - 36:41)
isn't the (36:40 - 36:44)
main team that they just have an a team (36:41 - 36:45)
and a b team (36:44 - 36:47)
um but they said the a team was working (36:45 - 36:48)
on a little town hero (36:47 - 36:50)
and the b team was working on um sword (36:48 - 36:51)
and shield (36:50 - 36:53)
and wha during that development people (36:51 - 36:55)
from the a team and people from the b (36:53 - 36:55)
team (36:55 - 36:58)
mid development would switch um to carry (36:55 - 37:01)
over ideals and gameplay mechanics and (36:58 - 37:03)
you know to keep it fresh so they're not (37:01 - 37:06)
working on the same game for three years (37:03 - 37:09)
uh so like if (37:06 - 37:13)
if they have two teams still (37:09 - 37:14)
because i don't think they hired any (37:13 - 37:15)
people i don't think any company is (37:14 - 37:16)
really hiring a bunch of people during a (37:15 - 37:17)
pandemic (37:16 - 37:19)
but if they still have two teams the (37:17 - 37:20)
general thought process was (37:19 - 37:22)
okay one team was working on let's go (37:20 - 37:23)
pikachu let's go eevee (37:22 - 37:25)
one team was working on sword and shield (37:23 - 37:27)
let's go pikachu let's go eevee came out (37:25 - 37:29)
a year later sword and shield came out (37:27 - 37:32)
team is working on dlc which came out (37:29 - 37:35)
all of last year so the thought process (37:32 - 37:36)
was okay that other team must be working (37:35 - 37:38)
on diamond pro remix while this other (37:36 - 37:40)
team is finishing up (37:38 - 37:44)
dlc but now we know that that (37:40 - 37:47)
isn't the case so they can make it right (37:44 - 37:49)
they can make there is probably a team (37:47 - 37:52)
right now working on gen 10. (37:49 - 37:54)
so yeah either we're sorry not to ten (37:52 - 37:55)
we're just skipping nine (37:54 - 37:58)
we're just going to skip and die (37:55 - 37:59)
fundamentally (37:58 - 38:02)
what i'm saying is whatever the future (37:59 - 38:04)
of pokemon games (38:02 - 38:06)
is coming from the pokemon it will not (38:04 - 38:07)
be (38:06 - 38:10)
uh you're presented with three starters (38:07 - 38:10)
i (38:10 - 38:13)
i i think i think gen nine will be (38:10 - 38:14)
you're presented with three starters (38:13 - 38:16)
you're going through the route you're (38:14 - 38:17)
doing eight gems there's not even gym (38:16 - 38:17)
leaders (38:17 - 38:21)
there's this is a the the arc archaeas (38:17 - 38:22)
is a single-player game there is no (38:21 - 38:24)
online component to it that's said on (38:22 - 38:25)
the japanese website (38:24 - 38:27)
there's no battling other trainers via (38:25 - 38:29)
the internet there's no local (38:27 - 38:31)
battling that we know of because it (38:29 - 38:32)
specifically says on the japanese (38:31 - 38:33)
website it doesn't (38:32 - 38:36)
there are no gym leaders in this game (38:33 - 38:37)
because they don't exist (38:36 - 38:41)
yeah i i think that still any anything (38:37 - 38:42)
that we get in the future is going to be (38:41 - 38:43)
more of (38:42 - 38:47)
uh sort of choose your own path (38:43 - 38:50)
side quests i think this is just a (38:47 - 38:53)
main series game that is not the same as (38:50 - 38:55)
a main generation game (38:53 - 38:57)
like let's go pikachu let's go eevee (38:55 - 38:59)
like let's go eevee let's go easy still (38:57 - 39:01)
a main series game but it's a little bit (38:59 - 39:02)
different (39:01 - 39:03)
than i don't think you're going to (39:02 - 39:05)
convince me i think when they said a new (39:03 - 39:06)
era of pokemon games begins (39:05 - 39:09)
i i think that they're meaning really (39:06 - 39:10)
saying we're closing the book on doing (39:09 - 39:12)
no there's no way gen 9 doesn't (39:10 - 39:14)
introduce a hundred new pokemon you pick (39:12 - 39:16)
three starters you become the champion (39:14 - 39:20)
you pair a tv show with it february 28 (39:16 - 39:24)
2021 let's we'll see we'll see (39:20 - 39:25)
i i think people have this mindset of (39:24 - 39:27)
like (39:25 - 39:29)
like sorry pokemon fans you're really (39:27 - 39:30)
uncreative (39:29 - 39:32)
like the the problem with something like (39:30 - 39:34)
let's go pikachu let's go evie when it (39:32 - 39:35)
came out (39:34 - 39:37)
while it was a different pokemon game it (39:35 - 39:39)
was still a pokemon game that (39:37 - 39:42)
shared similar beats as other pokemon (39:39 - 39:44)
games right just like this arceus game (39:42 - 39:45)
you'll be able to catch you'll be able (39:44 - 39:46)
to train you'll be able to explore (39:45 - 39:49)
like those are beats of a pokemon game (39:46 - 39:49)
um (39:49 - 39:53)
no one goes that like uh spirit tracks (39:49 - 39:55)
or what was that other pokemon game or (39:53 - 39:57)
zelda game not minish cap the (39:55 - 40:00)
the one the phantom hourglass those two (39:57 - 40:02)
specific zelda games were completely (40:00 - 40:04)
controlled with the stylus (40:02 - 40:06)
there there was no there was no d-pad (40:04 - 40:08)
you can even look at a game like skyward (40:06 - 40:10)
sword completely in motion control (40:08 - 40:12)
and those are still considered main (40:10 - 40:13)
series (40:12 - 40:15)
zelda games even though they did (40:13 - 40:17)
something different (40:15 - 40:20)
um and pokemon games have started to do (40:17 - 40:22)
that in the sense of like let's go (40:20 - 40:24)
pikachu let's go the main series pokemon (40:22 - 40:25)
game but you (40:24 - 40:28)
use motion control and this (40:25 - 40:30)
seems to be a main series pokemon game (40:28 - 40:32)
arceus uh because (40:30 - 40:34)
something uh joe joe from cerebe said (40:32 - 40:35)
something on the japanese website (40:34 - 40:37)
signified that it would be (40:35 - 40:38)
i couldn't find what that is and he (40:37 - 40:40)
wasn't very clear but i trust him in (40:38 - 40:41)
that in that regard (40:40 - 40:44)
um also it's being made by game freak (40:41 - 40:48)
uh but it doesn't have to (40:44 - 40:50)
always match up just like we don't have (40:48 - 40:52)
to ever get a let's go (40:50 - 40:54)
johto or a let's go sinnoh because we (40:52 - 40:57)
didn't like not every (40:54 - 40:59)
zelda game after skyward sword was (40:57 - 41:00)
forced in motion control right like (40:59 - 41:02)
we don't have to follow these patterns (41:00 - 41:04)
of one off game sometimes a company just (41:02 - 41:06)
wants to try something new (41:04 - 41:08)
and that's fine and then they go back to (41:06 - 41:10)
like how could they not go back to (41:08 - 41:12)
you pick three starters you go through (41:10 - 41:14)
eight gyms you beat a champion (41:12 - 41:16)
i don't know that formula sold 20 (41:14 - 41:17)
million copies (41:16 - 41:20)
like it was it's very proven over the 25 (41:17 - 41:21)
years that that formula (41:20 - 41:24)
works very well just like in a mario (41:21 - 41:26)
game it's it works very well to say (41:24 - 41:27)
hey collect all these things if you get (41:26 - 41:29)
enough of them you fight bowser at the (41:27 - 41:29)
end (41:29 - 41:31)
cool look even stephen king has stopped (41:29 - 41:35)
writing horror novels (41:31 - 41:37)
[Laughter] (41:35 - 41:41)
i mean has he though no i'm kidding (41:37 - 41:44)
come on i i just feel like they that (41:41 - 41:46)
they (41:44 - 41:48)
my sense that i'm getting is that they (41:46 - 41:50)
are tired of making the same game (41:48 - 41:53)
over and over and over again and they (41:50 - 41:55)
really want to take it in a completely (41:53 - 41:57)
new direction (41:55 - 41:59)
i don't without looking back i don't (41:57 - 42:01)
think so i think sword and shield (41:59 - 42:04)
like sword and shield a little thin (42:01 - 42:06)
compared to past pokemon games off the (42:04 - 42:08)
bat but with the inclusion of the dlc (42:06 - 42:10)
which is always the argument in video (42:08 - 42:12)
game culture they should the dlc should (42:10 - 42:13)
have been here the whole time (42:12 - 42:17)
but like the isle of armor (42:13 - 42:20)
in my opinion is probably the best like (42:17 - 42:20)
the (42:20 - 42:23)
the actual area is like the best part of (42:20 - 42:24)
sword and shield like (42:23 - 42:27)
being able to explore that no tundra is (42:24 - 42:28)
better (42:27 - 42:29)
crown tundra is weird because you can't (42:28 - 42:31)
do it tundra is so much better than isle (42:29 - 42:32)
of armor get out of here (42:31 - 42:36)
with your garbage tape like the forest (42:32 - 42:39)
the little swamp area the sharpiedos we (42:36 - 42:39)
all love (42:39 - 42:44)
sharpieda no we don't that's awful (42:39 - 42:44)
okay like like i predicted we're all (42:50 - 42:53)
over the place (42:52 - 42:55)
we haven't talked about a single game (42:53 - 42:57)
here um (42:55 - 43:00)
i don't think that we're gonna take a (42:57 - 43:01)
break here in a second but i (43:00 - 43:04)
i think that ilka (43:01 - 43:06)
helping or being the new like they they (43:04 - 43:08)
worked on pokemon home (43:06 - 43:11)
which is not a great thing in my opinion (43:08 - 43:12)
to be like (43:11 - 43:14)
hey we worked on pokemon home because i (43:12 - 43:15)
don't think pokemon home is as (43:14 - 43:18)
good as it can be look your resume can (43:15 - 43:18)
either (43:18 - 43:21)
include include facts or lies yes all (43:18 - 43:23)
right yeah (43:21 - 43:27)
i don't think pokemon home (43:23 - 43:29)
i think pokemon home suffers from it (43:27 - 43:31)
doesn't know what it wants to be (43:29 - 43:33)
and no no okay but it could be let's (43:31 - 43:36)
look at the words ilka and pokemon home (43:33 - 43:37)
right (43:36 - 43:40)
i i will bet you dollars to donuts which (43:37 - 43:42)
is a phrase i hate saying (43:40 - 43:45)
ilka did the graphics for pokemon home (43:42 - 43:47)
and you know what those the graphics (43:45 - 43:48)
that are in there (43:47 - 43:51)
aren't aren't that bad (43:48 - 43:54)
well if they did the i don't think they (43:51 - 43:56)
designed how it works (43:54 - 43:58)
yeah maybe i think so yeah i guess we (43:56 - 43:59)
don't know (43:58 - 44:04)
the full yeah the full scale of that (43:59 - 44:04)
i think though like if if at the end of (44:05 - 44:09)
the day (44:08 - 44:10)
even if you don't care about what (44:09 - 44:12)
company is making what game (44:10 - 44:14)
which probably the majority of people (44:12 - 44:16)
who walk into target or walmart and buy (44:14 - 44:18)
a pokemon game and play like (44:16 - 44:21)
those people don't care right like (44:18 - 44:24)
um i i think though that (44:21 - 44:27)
this solution was better than what (44:24 - 44:29)
16 year olds on reddit was screaming (44:27 - 44:30)
about which is like (44:29 - 44:33)
hire more people like the solution of (44:30 - 44:36)
let's have another company (44:33 - 44:39)
help us do these games one so we can (44:36 - 44:41)
continue putting out pokemon games every (44:39 - 44:43)
year and two (44:41 - 44:45)
neither of these teams are consistently (44:43 - 44:46)
underwater because the (44:45 - 44:48)
actual takeaway here is the pokemon (44:46 - 44:50)
company itself (44:48 - 44:53)
is this huge machine that cannot be (44:50 - 44:55)
stopped it keeps moving forward every (44:53 - 44:56)
year there's (44:55 - 44:58)
tcg sets every three months there's (44:56 - 45:00)
anime there's a brand new anime (44:58 - 45:01)
every single year every year they put (45:00 - 45:03)
out a movie there's non-stop (45:01 - 45:08)
merch and they cannot have a game stop (45:03 - 45:11)
because that stops everything else that (45:08 - 45:12)
goes along with it (45:11 - 45:14)
it stops the merchandise it stops the (45:12 - 45:16)
tcg it stops the anime (45:14 - 45:18)
and once you stop those things all of a (45:16 - 45:19)
sudden those voice actors are not (45:18 - 45:20)
getting paid all of a sudden those (45:19 - 45:22)
distributors are not being able to order (45:20 - 45:23)
cards and ship them over (45:22 - 45:24)
all of a sudden the people working on (45:23 - 45:26)
the movie have to like twiddle their (45:24 - 45:28)
thumbs like you're stopping so many (45:26 - 45:29)
things (45:28 - 45:30)
um that not only are you stopping things (45:29 - 45:32)
for your customers you're stopping (45:30 - 45:33)
things for the people who (45:32 - 45:36)
rely on that as a job so i think like (45:33 - 45:38)
this is the best of both worlds of (45:36 - 45:40)
we have another company in here to (45:38 - 45:42)
alleviate (45:40 - 45:44)
and give both studios more times to make (45:42 - 45:45)
a better game (45:44 - 45:50)
um can i can i have one request (45:45 - 45:54)
post malone concert over for 2021 can we (45:50 - 45:54)
stop (45:54 - 45:58)
referring to reddit as having a valued (45:54 - 45:59)
opinion (45:58 - 46:03)
on anything like it's 11 (45:59 - 46:05)
of the internet populace uses reddit and (46:03 - 46:06)
that's (46:05 - 46:10)
just such a small market okay (46:06 - 46:12)
everybody i know is on there though it's (46:10 - 46:15)
like that's so disappointing (46:12 - 46:18)
like they aren't they aren't a huge (46:15 - 46:21)
segment of the populace (46:18 - 46:22)
their boycott for sword and shield (46:21 - 46:24)
really it didn't do anything like we (46:22 - 46:26)
keep talking about reddit like they're (46:24 - 46:30)
important it's not just my one wish if (46:26 - 46:31)
we could stop thinking that anything (46:30 - 46:33)
that reddit has to say (46:31 - 46:36)
is really impactful in any manner that (46:33 - 46:40)
would just make me happy (46:36 - 46:40)
so did you read on reddit that no i (46:40 - 46:44)
don't read reddit (46:42 - 46:47)
there's nothing interesting there ever (46:44 - 46:48)
i i think it's i think it's just the (46:47 - 46:50)
problem that we we deal with (46:48 - 46:53)
as or maybe i deal with directly because (46:50 - 46:54)
people come on (46:53 - 46:56)
twitch and they say like oh i read this (46:54 - 46:58)
on twitter i read this on reddit did you (46:56 - 46:59)
see this facebook group and then we have (46:58 - 47:01)
to like kind of clear up this (46:59 - 47:01)
conversation (47:01 - 47:04)
of like what's actually happening so (47:01 - 47:05)
when i say (47:04 - 47:07)
reddit i'm just thinking of the people (47:05 - 47:09)
that are consistently yelling (47:07 - 47:12)
like the people that were were like the (47:09 - 47:13)
people that said (47:12 - 47:14)
a year ago i don't want game freak (47:13 - 47:16)
touching diamond and pearl because (47:14 - 47:17)
they'll ruin it and then (47:16 - 47:18)
they're like well gabriel's not making (47:17 - 47:20)
it and then those people were still (47:18 - 47:21)
upset (47:20 - 47:23)
yeah that's just yeah i mean those (47:21 - 47:24)
people will never (47:23 - 47:27)
be happy if you go to the upset factory (47:24 - 47:30)
you can't be bothered that the product (47:27 - 47:31)
that they're giving out is (47:30 - 47:35)
being upset like reddit is there (47:31 - 47:38)
to churn out people being angry so if (47:35 - 47:39)
you're gonna go to reddit and say (47:38 - 47:41)
everybody on reddit's mad what did you (47:39 - 47:43)
expect (47:41 - 47:45)
i went to the shoe store not expecting (47:43 - 47:46)
to buy bread (47:45 - 47:50)
like yes we can just stop it's the same (47:46 - 47:50)
like (47:50 - 47:52)
everybody on twitter quote unquote (47:50 - 47:54)
twitter is a small amount of people (47:52 - 47:56)
yes who are just screaming at about a (47:54 - 47:58)
bunch of things to get noticed like (47:56 - 47:59)
these are not (47:58 - 48:03)
valid benchmarks upon which to judge (47:59 - 48:06)
everybody's approval or disapproval (48:03 - 48:07)
about the game (48:06 - 48:09)
yeah but you can't just ignore those all (48:07 - 48:10)
together because there are things on (48:09 - 48:11)
reddit and (48:10 - 48:13)
you really can't no no no there are (48:11 - 48:14)
things on reddit twitter that do bring (48:13 - 48:15)
things to life (48:14 - 48:18)
like the whole fact like i i didn't know (48:15 - 48:20)
the four times i watched this trailer (48:18 - 48:22)
that the one npc (48:20 - 48:25)
standing in flora town (48:22 - 48:29)
was the npc from platinum (48:25 - 48:29)
you could ask me i knew that well i (48:30 - 48:34)
didn't see you tweet it (48:33 - 48:37)
or posted on reddit now did i well (48:34 - 48:38)
because i don't (48:37 - 48:40)
that what does i mean that doesn't you (48:38 - 48:41)
know how many retweets you could have (48:40 - 48:42)
got greg (48:41 - 48:44)
yeah it does add it because people are (48:42 - 48:46)
wondering it's like will they have the (48:44 - 48:48)
platinum post game (48:46 - 48:50)
in these games and it appears that (48:48 - 48:51)
they're going to do like they did with (48:50 - 48:54)
aorus and have the emerald posters yeah (48:51 - 48:55)
yeah yeah yeah (48:54 - 48:56)
yeah okay but they didn't have all of (48:55 - 48:58)
the emerald post game right like (48:56 - 49:02)
all of battle factory wasn't in oris (48:58 - 49:03)
we can't say they're going to have the (49:02 - 49:05)
full platinum yeah yeah yeah post game (49:03 - 49:07)
man i came to the battle factory and i (49:05 - 49:08)
got a shoe (49:07 - 49:11)
greg your whole world is screwed up but (49:08 - 49:14)
the thing is is like (49:11 - 49:15)
to think that they aren't going to (49:14 - 49:17)
include the improvements in platinum (49:15 - 49:20)
is a wild take since they aren't going (49:17 - 49:22)
to remake that game they made the two (49:20 - 49:23)
they haven't like they didn't remake (49:22 - 49:24)
crystal (49:23 - 49:26)
they didn't remake emerald they barely (49:24 - 49:29)
remade yellow they don't tend to remake (49:26 - 49:32)
the third games but they tend to (49:29 - 49:35)
throughout all these games include the (49:32 - 49:36)
benefits (49:35 - 49:38)
and the quality of life things that (49:36 - 49:40)
appeared in that third game (49:38 - 49:43)
in that remake they have done that every (49:40 - 49:44)
time i don't think that's (49:43 - 49:47)
groundbreaking to point out that the (49:44 - 49:49)
person that gives you the flower (49:47 - 49:51)
for a thing that appears right she gives (49:49 - 49:52)
you shaman yeah (49:51 - 49:55)
is in this game it's a great flower (49:52 - 49:56)
thank you (49:55 - 49:59)
yeah okay it's just not well we have to (49:56 - 50:01)
we haven't actually talked about the (49:59 - 50:04)
games themselves i know we'll get there (50:01 - 50:06)
so let's take a break okay and then (50:04 - 50:08)
we'll come back we'll start off talking (50:06 - 50:08)
about (50:08 - 50:10)
legends and then we'll talk about the (50:08 - 50:13)
lego toy (50:10 - 50:18)
diamond don't start i hate that so much (50:13 - 50:18)
wow (50:25 - 50:28)
[Music] (50:28 - 50:37)
[Music] (50:44 - 50:50)
and then i say that is (50:53 - 51:10)
a dynamics band (51:18 - 51:24)
and we are back (51:27 - 51:33)
so let's talk about pokemon (51:30 - 51:36)
legends arceus they said arceus (51:33 - 51:38)
multiple times oh come on they locked (51:36 - 51:41)
that in when they built the rks (51:38 - 51:44)
system and yeah but detective pikachu (51:41 - 51:45)
they said rcs (51:44 - 51:48)
and it was a little confusing i had to (51:45 - 51:50)
correct people on twitter it's fine (51:48 - 51:53)
it's arceus just (51:50 - 51:55)
it's the same as the pokedex 3d pro it's (51:53 - 51:56)
the same as (51:55 - 51:58)
uh pokemon battle revolution the little (51:56 - 51:59)
like the yes (51:58 - 52:03)
uh thing you know somebody somebody on (51:59 - 52:04)
twitter greg (52:03 - 52:06)
said uh you know you can't you have to (52:04 - 52:08)
take it with a grain of salt (52:06 - 52:11)
and my thought process is if the ceo of (52:08 - 52:13)
the pokemon company is saying arceus (52:11 - 52:16)
i don't know i don't know what kind of (52:13 - 52:19)
salt we buying but i don't know who to (52:16 - 52:22)
believe at that point then i feel like (52:19 - 52:25)
you can say whatever you want yeah yes (52:22 - 52:25)
officially (52:25 - 52:28)
it is arceus yes the whole point of (52:25 - 52:29)
mythical names is so (52:28 - 52:33)
that when you say it everyone (52:29 - 52:35)
regardless of language knows what you're (52:33 - 52:37)
talking about but obviously accents and (52:35 - 52:40)
stuff come into play i i'm fine with (52:37 - 52:41)
arceus but when people start telling me (52:40 - 52:43)
that kellaby is wrong (52:41 - 52:44)
that's when i'm gonna start fighting or (52:43 - 52:46)
cinderache come on (52:44 - 52:49)
well cinderacci is not a mythical (52:46 - 52:50)
kelluby is (52:49 - 52:53)
oh yeah okay so (52:50 - 52:56)
available early 2022 they showed like a (52:53 - 52:58)
two-minute trailer although (52:56 - 52:59)
i would i would probably say there was (52:58 - 53:01)
only like 60 seconds of uh (52:59 - 53:05)
gameplay footage uh (53:01 - 53:07)
the pokemon legends arceus game will (53:05 - 53:08)
honor pokemon's core (53:07 - 53:11)
gameplay while infusing a new action rpg (53:08 - 53:12)
you'll need to catch (53:11 - 53:14)
survey and research wild pokemon in the (53:12 - 53:15)
long (53:14 - 53:18)
gone era of sinnoh to recreate the first (53:15 - 53:19)
pokedex so we kind of got what the (53:18 - 53:22)
premise of the game is (53:19 - 53:22)
make the pokedex sounds like you're done (53:22 - 53:26)
yep um (53:24 - 53:29)
to catch pokemon you can observe them (53:26 - 53:30)
learn their behavior (53:29 - 53:32)
sneak up carefully aim your pokeball let (53:30 - 53:34)
it fly (53:32 - 53:36)
right off their website uh you can have (53:34 - 53:38)
your ally pokemon battle wild pokemon (53:36 - 53:40)
that you hope to catch just throw the (53:38 - 53:42)
pokeball (53:40 - 53:44)
holding your ally pokemon near a wild (53:42 - 53:46)
pokemon and you will seamlessly enter a (53:44 - 53:47)
battle (53:46 - 53:49)
and command your pokemon by choosing the (53:47 - 53:51)
moves it knows (53:49 - 53:53)
it looks like they copy and pasted the (53:51 - 53:55)
swish (53:53 - 53:57)
blue swish from sun and moon behind the (53:55 - 53:59)
like hp bar do you guys remember that in (53:57 - 54:00)
sun and moon battles they had like those (53:59 - 54:02)
swishes behind the bars (54:00 - 54:06)
oh yeah vaguely kind of listen (54:02 - 54:07)
since i played those games thinking (54:06 - 54:09)
about it you'll be brought to the center (54:07 - 54:11)
region the setting uh for diamond and (54:09 - 54:14)
pearl but this is long before those (54:11 - 54:17)
uh before ideals of being a trainer or (54:14 - 54:19)
having a pokemon league even existed (54:17 - 54:20)
which kind of hints that there doesn't (54:19 - 54:21)
seem to be (54:20 - 54:25)
other trainers or other (54:21 - 54:30)
no gems i mean no gyms (54:25 - 54:34)
definitely um i would imagine that there (54:30 - 54:35)
will be (54:34 - 54:38)
other trainers but not sort of like i'm (54:35 - 54:40)
a pokemon trainer yeah right (54:38 - 54:42)
title i'm also imagining there will be (54:40 - 54:43)
some sort (54:42 - 54:47)
of bad guy (54:43 - 54:49)
element to the game yes like i don't (54:47 - 54:50)
know i don't (54:49 - 54:54)
um i i do think that in your (54:50 - 54:57)
in your pursuits you'll run into people (54:54 - 54:57)
who are (54:57 - 55:00)
who are who are doing things for a (54:57 - 55:02)
quote-unquote (55:00 - 55:04)
unkind purpose and you will have to stop (55:02 - 55:06)
them the truth is it's hard to have (55:04 - 55:08)
story it's hard to have narrative (55:06 - 55:10)
without conflict right right (55:08 - 55:11)
there's going to be some there's going (55:10 - 55:13)
to be some sort of conflict (55:11 - 55:16)
to drive the game pokemon snap really (55:13 - 55:17)
does well without (55:16 - 55:18)
needing conflict oh trust me the (55:17 - 55:20)
conflict is aiming that (55:18 - 55:23)
dag on camera conflict is the professor (55:20 - 55:24)
not like you don't hear photos (55:23 - 55:27)
oh man he's like you're three pixels off (55:24 - 55:28)
no good (55:27 - 55:31)
two stars so if if you say what the goal (55:28 - 55:33)
of (55:31 - 55:34)
a pokemon game would be it would (55:33 - 55:36)
probably be to be the champion (55:34 - 55:38)
to be eight gyms to beat the elite four (55:36 - 55:40)
to be the champion and this it is (55:38 - 55:44)
to complete the first ever pokedex (55:40 - 55:47)
um so it doesn't seem like battling is a (55:44 - 55:48)
huge (55:47 - 55:52)
focus but but wait wait wait also let me (55:48 - 55:54)
reiterate what i've had to tell probably (55:52 - 55:55)
about 20 people (55:54 - 55:58)
so far how many were on reddit (55:55 - 56:02)
zero uh mostly text messages (55:58 - 56:05)
and twitter dms and (56:02 - 56:08)
one instagram um (56:05 - 56:10)
hey instagram's becoming the messaging (56:08 - 56:12)
yeah it is it (56:10 - 56:15)
definitely is we have seen (56:12 - 56:19)
very little of this game do not (56:15 - 56:23)
make your overall complete assumption (56:19 - 56:25)
of what this game is based on what (56:23 - 56:26)
you've seen (56:25 - 56:30)
so far if we know anything about (56:26 - 56:32)
pokemon game announcements they give you (56:30 - 56:33)
a little (56:32 - 56:35)
nugget at the beginning and we're going (56:33 - 56:38)
to have a year's worth of reveals (56:35 - 56:41)
and more information yes and oh hey look (56:38 - 56:42)
it's a pixelated (56:41 - 56:44)
farfetch that's actually a surf fetch (56:42 - 56:46)
running around your computer screen (56:44 - 56:49)
yes um you can you do not know (56:46 - 56:50)
everything (56:49 - 56:53)
at this point you cannot judge (56:50 - 56:56)
this game and also just to throw in with (56:53 - 56:58)
that as well i've gotten complaints (56:56 - 57:00)
about the quality of the (56:58 - 57:02)
rendering of the graphics yes and i do (57:00 - 57:03)
want to talk about that (57:02 - 57:05)
well i was just like we historically (57:03 - 57:06)
know that they have (57:05 - 57:09)
in the past done first previews of games (57:06 - 57:11)
that were not finished yet (57:09 - 57:15)
and the graphics improve mm-hmm (57:11 - 57:17)
we don't know exactly what or more than (57:15 - 57:19)
a year in development they (57:17 - 57:22)
built this yes trailer like whatever (57:19 - 57:24)
i'm not getting into it the only thing i (57:22 - 57:26)
will point out is somebody did point out (57:24 - 57:30)
that the pattern design on your (57:26 - 57:34)
outfit is similar to the team galactic (57:30 - 57:35)
logo (57:34 - 57:38)
yeah i saw that too okay so (57:35 - 57:41)
speaking of people making exceptions i (57:38 - 57:42)
don't want to spend a lot of time on (57:41 - 57:43)
this but (57:42 - 57:46)
uh two things the first thing (57:43 - 57:48)
is when they when they do that panning (57:46 - 57:50)
shot from behind the trainer (57:48 - 57:51)
and then look at mount cornett because (57:50 - 57:53)
we know that's mount cornet (57:51 - 57:54)
somebody lined that up with the same (57:53 - 57:56)
opening trailer of breath of wild (57:54 - 57:59)
and it is one to one identical like they (57:56 - 58:00)
knew what they were doing there they (57:59 - 58:03)
wanted to capture that feeling of (58:00 - 58:04)
do you want to know what else it matches (58:03 - 58:07)
up to probably like the elder scrolls (58:04 - 58:07)
thing as well (58:07 - 58:11)
the opening shot of sound of music nice (58:07 - 58:13)
never seen that movie but i'll tell you (58:11 - 58:15)
breath of the wild the musical (58:13 - 58:19)
uh sound of music it is a big sweeping (58:15 - 58:19)
shot (58:19 - 58:22)
that was developed and shown in that (58:19 - 58:23)
film (58:22 - 58:25)
to capture the grandeur of the (58:23 - 58:27)
countryside it is not a mistake that (58:25 - 58:29)
they use it in multiple games to show (58:27 - 58:29)
off (58:29 - 58:32)
look at how huge our world is going to (58:29 - 58:33)
be like (58:32 - 58:35)
that doesn't mean anything you they're (58:33 - 58:36)
the same shot (58:35 - 58:40)
wait a minute is it not the most pokemon (58:36 - 58:41)
fan thing in the world (58:40 - 58:44)
that like what three four years ago i (58:41 - 58:45)
don't know how many whenever breath of (58:44 - 58:46)
the wild first came out (58:45 - 58:48)
all the pokemon fans were like five or (58:46 - 58:50)
six (58:48 - 58:50)
why can't we have pokemon breath of the (58:50 - 58:56)
wild i want pokemon breath of the wild (58:52 - 58:57)
we get pokemon breath of the wild and (58:56 - 58:59)
like this is not what i want (58:57 - 59:04)
no not like this i'm unhappy (58:59 - 59:06)
okay so if you go to the outreach (59:04 - 59:09)
factory expect to get outright (59:06 - 59:12)
i (59:09 - 59:12)
i do get frustrated that every game gets (59:13 - 59:16)
compared to breath of the wild (59:15 - 59:20)
but also i lived through the early 2000s (59:16 - 59:21)
where a lot of games got compared to (59:20 - 59:23)
super mario 64. (59:21 - 59:25)
rest of the wild is just the game that (59:23 - 59:27)
is on the to-do list and before breath (59:25 - 59:27)
of the wild (59:27 - 59:30)
i i'm pretty sure it was dark souls (59:27 - 59:32)
everything was compared to dark souls (59:30 - 59:33)
this plays like dark souls this is as (59:32 - 59:35)
hard as dark souls this looks like dark (59:33 - 59:37)
souls you roll like dark souls (59:35 - 59:39)
i get it it it is very exhausting though (59:37 - 59:40)
that (59:39 - 59:42)
any game coming out whether it's (59:40 - 59:43)
nintendo or not gets compared to breath (59:42 - 59:45)
of the wild (59:43 - 59:47)
um the the second point i want to make (59:45 - 59:48)
is the the open world (59:47 - 59:51)
you heard me read the press release (59:48 - 59:52)
where on the official website there's (59:51 - 59:54)
also a nintendo press release about (59:52 - 59:56)
these games but i read the official (59:54 - 59:57)
pokemon press release nowhere did they (59:56 - 59:58)
ever (59:57 - 60:00)
say the words open world with that being (59:58 - 60:02)
said does the game look (60:00 - 60:04)
open world yes i'm not going to debate (60:02 - 60:06)
that it does look open world but they (60:04 - 60:10)
chose not to use those two words yet (60:06 - 60:13)
and the only reason i bring that up is (60:10 - 60:15)
because (60:13 - 60:17)
time and time again people's (60:15 - 60:20)
expectations rise (60:17 - 60:23)
because they make these assumptions (60:20 - 60:25)
and then a game comes out and they don't (60:23 - 60:27)
meet the assumptions that the game never (60:25 - 60:28)
said (60:27 - 60:30)
but they thought a funny story is like (60:28 - 60:31)
when the (60:30 - 60:33)
when the wii u when the wii first came (60:31 - 60:34)
out (60:33 - 60:37)
this was the time where like um (60:34 - 60:40)
ps2 ps3 xbox 360 xbox (60:37 - 60:42)
whatever they all had shooting games (60:40 - 60:44)
with online and i was waiting in line to (60:42 - 60:46)
try the wii early and the one of the we (60:44 - 60:48)
launched games was a game called red (60:46 - 60:50)
steel which was a samurai game it was a (60:48 - 60:51)
shooter you could shoot (60:50 - 60:52)
and then you could swing your wiimote (60:51 - 60:54)
and it would be a sword and there was (60:52 - 60:56)
this huge group of people in front of me (60:54 - 60:58)
and we were waiting to try red steel (60:56 - 61:00)
for the very first time we wasn't out (60:58 - 61:01)
yet (61:00 - 61:02)
and they were all talking about how they (61:01 - 61:05)
couldn't wait to play this game online (61:02 - 61:07)
when shoot each other with their (61:05 - 61:09)
wiimotes and to slice each other with (61:07 - 61:11)
their wiimotes (61:09 - 61:13)
and because their assumption was well (61:11 - 61:16)
every other ps2 and xbox game and xbox (61:13 - 61:17)
like all these other shooters have (61:16 - 61:20)
online but nowhere did ubisoft (61:17 - 61:23)
uh makers of friends deal advertised (61:20 - 61:24)
that this game had online (61:23 - 61:26)
and all these like the entire 20 30 (61:24 - 61:28)
minutes they were just talking about how (61:26 - 61:29)
great the outline was going to be for (61:28 - 61:30)
red steel when it was never even talked (61:29 - 61:31)
about (61:30 - 61:36)
um so again i do think the game will (61:31 - 61:36)
probably be (61:36 - 61:39)
open world but the if the nintendo's (61:36 - 61:41)
press release the pokemon.com (61:39 - 61:44)
the japanese pokemon website the pokemon (61:41 - 61:45)
press really none of them say the words (61:44 - 61:46)
open world (61:45 - 61:49)
and it was funny because one of our (61:46 - 61:50)
viewers one of our listeners in slack (61:49 - 61:52)
went to joe cerby (61:50 - 61:54)
joe hello if you're listening i do love (61:52 - 61:55)
joe by the way joe the (61:54 - 61:58)
webmaster of cerebe went to his twitch (61:55 - 62:00)
stream the other night and said hey do (61:58 - 62:01)
you think (62:00 - 62:05)
that arceus is an open world game and he (62:01 - 62:05)
said (62:05 - 62:08)
yes of course they even said that and (62:05 - 62:10)
then his girlfriend sitting next to him (62:08 - 62:12)
she said well they never said it during (62:10 - 62:13)
the trailer which is true they never (62:12 - 62:15)
used the words open world (62:13 - 62:17)
and so you watch joe lean forward (62:15 - 62:19)
clickily clacky on the keyboard he's (62:17 - 62:21)
like i'm checking the press release (62:19 - 62:23)
and he goes oh they didn't say open (62:21 - 62:24)
world (62:23 - 62:26)
he's and then he goes well they said (62:24 - 62:29)
grand vistas yeah sure they said grand (62:26 - 62:30)
vistas but like (62:29 - 62:32)
that doesn't mean anything they did the (62:30 - 62:33)
art style (62:32 - 62:36)
is absolutely amazing from my point of (62:33 - 62:38)
view (62:36 - 62:39)
and it was funny because right before he (62:38 - 62:41)
got to that point he was having the same (62:39 - 62:42)
argument we just had which was (62:41 - 62:44)
hey pokemon fans like to make (62:42 - 62:46)
assumptions don't make assumptions (62:44 - 62:47)
because you'll build up (62:46 - 62:50)
but again it's just does this game look (62:47 - 62:51)
open world yeah sure but there are (62:50 - 62:52)
different (62:51 - 62:54)
scales of open world right like the open (62:52 - 62:56)
world wild area in sword and shield is (62:54 - 62:58)
different than breath of wild which is (62:56 - 62:59)
different than final fantasy 15. (62:58 - 63:02)
it's different than ocarina of time um (62:59 - 63:03)
that (63:02 - 63:04)
is exactly the way that i was going to (63:03 - 63:07)
put it was if you consider the wild area (63:04 - 63:08)
if you consider the crowd (63:07 - 63:10)
i would say more like crown tundra and (63:08 - 63:12)
island (63:10 - 63:15)
if you consider those to be open world (63:12 - 63:16)
then that's what you're going to get (63:15 - 63:19)
with this that this is an extension of (63:16 - 63:20)
that (63:19 - 63:23)
type of pokemon play and i did not play (63:20 - 63:26)
gears of war the new gears of war but (63:23 - 63:28)
that is an open world game but they hide (63:26 - 63:30)
the open world they (63:28 - 63:33)
they hide the fact that it's not really (63:30 - 63:35)
open world by driving a car from area to (63:33 - 63:38)
area so you have these huge areas (63:35 - 63:40)
and if you want to get to another area (63:38 - 63:42)
you're you're driving a car but it's (63:40 - 63:44)
actually hiding the fact that (63:42 - 63:46)
you can't do anything in between that (63:44 - 63:47)
from point a to point well and (63:46 - 63:50)
like right like monster hunter world (63:47 - 63:51)
right you've got (63:50 - 63:53)
very large regions that you can move (63:51 - 63:55)
around in but if you want to go (63:53 - 63:58)
from like the desert kind of region to (63:55 - 64:00)
the jungle kind of region you can't just (63:58 - 64:03)
no there's right there you have like (64:00 - 64:07)
open world maps yeah so yeah um (64:03 - 64:08)
anyways i just want to talk about that (64:07 - 64:10)
do i think the game is open world myself (64:08 - 64:13)
yes what level of open world don't know (64:10 - 64:15)
do has game freak done open world (64:13 - 64:16)
yes i think the isle of armor and crown (64:15 - 64:19)
tundra is a great example of them being (64:16 - 64:21)
able to do it and having pokemon spawn (64:19 - 64:21)
and (64:21 - 64:23)
and being able to explore with with (64:21 - 64:25)
little to no load times although it does (64:23 - 64:26)
get a little chunky (64:25 - 64:29)
um from time to time so i just wanted to (64:26 - 64:30)
bring that up (64:29 - 64:34)
um the other thing is (64:30 - 64:36)
some people were asking why are you do (64:34 - 64:38)
you not pick the cinna starters in a (64:36 - 64:38)
cinno game (64:38 - 64:41)
well because you're the one discovering (64:38 - 64:43)
the cinematographers so that one's kind (64:41 - 64:44)
of like (64:43 - 64:47)
oh i i have a sense and once again right (64:44 - 64:48)
don't take this as fact (64:47 - 64:50)
take this as will anderson's sense of (64:48 - 64:52)
interpretation is that (64:50 - 64:56)
at this time in history that we will be (64:52 - 64:57)
playing this game (64:56 - 65:01)
it's like right xeno's an island yeah (64:57 - 65:04)
wait right right uh obviously like the (65:01 - 65:06)
south north part of japan yeah which is (65:04 - 65:09)
an island um (65:06 - 65:11)
[Music] (65:09 - 65:14)
my my take is that like you are among (65:11 - 65:15)
the first (65:14 - 65:19)
humans to come and settle (65:15 - 65:22)
on this island that's why you're (65:19 - 65:24)
going out to discover all the pokemon (65:22 - 65:26)
and that's why there's not an (65:24 - 65:28)
established like hey i'm the sinnoh (65:26 - 65:29)
pokemon (65:28 - 65:31)
researcher it's like there is one (65:29 - 65:32)
village of humans (65:31 - 65:34)
maybe there's a few like outcroppings of (65:32 - 65:36)
people like intense or whatever (65:34 - 65:38)
but there's like one village of humans (65:36 - 65:40)
in sinnoh (65:38 - 65:41)
and you are there that's where you start (65:40 - 65:43)
that's why it's your base (65:41 - 65:44)
and then you will explore this in our (65:43 - 65:47)
region but you're not going to (65:44 - 65:50)
it's not going to be a bunch of towns to (65:47 - 65:51)
go from here to there (65:50 - 65:54)
so that's why another reason why why are (65:51 - 65:56)
there no sinnoh starters because (65:54 - 65:58)
right because we've just settled cino (65:56 - 66:00)
right (65:58 - 66:02)
maybe i'm just way into the pokeball (66:00 - 66:03)
design (66:02 - 66:06)
i love this thing so much are you are (66:03 - 66:07)
you guys (66:06 - 66:10)
actually excited for this game i am uh (66:07 - 66:14)
yes so i love i love (66:10 - 66:16)
anything that expands the lore and (66:14 - 66:18)
sinnoh being one of the most (66:16 - 66:21)
history-rich lore rich of the game (66:18 - 66:21)
series (66:21 - 66:25)
to be able to go back in time to (66:21 - 66:28)
really explore the history and the (66:25 - 66:30)
development of that region (66:28 - 66:33)
is incredibly exciting to me um (66:30 - 66:36)
i think everything that i've seen so far (66:33 - 66:38)
has me excited (66:36 - 66:41)
like i like the the way the world looks (66:38 - 66:45)
i like how the how they've taken (66:41 - 66:47)
what modern cinnamon was and then (66:45 - 66:48)
brought it down to (66:47 - 66:50)
historical paths like the costuming is (66:48 - 66:53)
really good the pokeball is incredible (66:50 - 66:56)
the vistas look great like everything (66:53 - 66:57)
about (66:56 - 67:00)
the game so far has me very excited to (66:57 - 67:02)
play the game (67:00 - 67:04)
like i even if the story is very basic (67:02 - 67:06)
it's just a basic exploration of what (67:04 - 67:08)
happened in the past (67:06 - 67:11)
i am very into that basic exploration of (67:08 - 67:12)
what happened in the past (67:11 - 67:15)
and i hope we get that for more regions (67:12 - 67:16)
i think it (67:15 - 67:18)
it really helps develop the world of (67:16 - 67:20)
pokemon (67:18 - 67:23)
to not always be in the present day but (67:20 - 67:24)
to also (67:23 - 67:27)
look at the past that they've never (67:24 - 67:29)
really explored before and that alone is (67:27 - 67:31)
very exciting which they talk about (67:29 - 67:33)
they talk about but we don't ever get to (67:31 - 67:34)
experience it well black and white (67:33 - 67:36)
already did this with pokemon typing (67:34 - 67:38)
adventure (67:36 - 67:38)
nobody played pokemon typing adventure (67:39 - 67:44)
okay well if they wanted the deep (67:41 - 67:47)
lore of unova unova they could have (67:44 - 67:48)
typed away (67:47 - 67:50)
it was only available in japanese no it (67:48 - 67:51)
was in the uk (67:50 - 67:55)
too you had to import it there you go uh (67:51 - 67:57)
one of our listeners is a woodworker and (67:55 - 67:59)
metal worker and has already started (67:57 - 68:01)
planning on making reproductions of the (67:59 - 68:04)
wooden yeah the wooden steam i just love (68:01 - 68:05)
that thing so much (68:04 - 68:08)
it's mostly made of wood and steam puffs (68:05 - 68:10)
from the top when it's caught it's such (68:08 - 68:10)
a (68:10 - 68:12)
it's such a great way can i can i (68:10 - 68:14)
address another complaint that i've (68:12 - 68:15)
received (68:14 - 68:18)
yes all right okay so i like how you're (68:15 - 68:21)
like oh you have nothing to say (68:18 - 68:21)
because because i am i'm thrilled and (68:22 - 68:27)
yet people love to tell me what (68:25 - 68:30)
they don't like um so i did get a (68:27 - 68:31)
complaint of oh hey (68:30 - 68:34)
do i i hate the fact i just throw (68:31 - 68:37)
pokeballs at pokemon and i don't have to (68:34 - 68:39)
battle them to weaken them (68:37 - 68:42)
and so most pokemon games they (68:39 - 68:43)
they're they're ruined they've ruined it (68:42 - 68:45)
for me and so i have (68:43 - 68:47)
once again i have two points to address (68:45 - 68:50)
uh this particular complaint number one (68:47 - 68:53)
nobody said that yeah that is not hinted (68:50 - 68:54)
at all (68:53 - 68:57)
number two if you (68:54 - 68:59)
have paid attention to pokemon in the (68:57 - 69:01)
past few years (68:59 - 69:04)
in pokemon go you do not battle pokemon (69:01 - 69:06)
before you catch them (69:04 - 69:09)
you throw balls at them in pokemon let's (69:06 - 69:10)
go (69:09 - 69:12)
you do not battle the pokemon mostly (69:10 - 69:13)
usually of the time (69:12 - 69:16)
you just throw balls at them this is a (69:13 - 69:18)
mechanic that has existed now (69:16 - 69:22)
in pokemon games for years (69:18 - 69:24)
okay so but also you can apply that to (69:22 - 69:25)
sword and shield where most people just (69:24 - 69:26)
throw a quick ball (69:25 - 69:30)
and move up with like wow (69:26 - 69:30)
they monkeyed around with the whole like (69:30 - 69:34)
if you're pokemon (69:33 - 69:36)
is not at a higher level then it's (69:34 - 69:38)
harder to catch the other pokemon yeah (69:36 - 69:40)
they that is true they play with it some (69:38 - 69:42)
but i mean (69:40 - 69:44)
the first route always catch has been (69:42 - 69:46)
for a while too like (69:44 - 69:48)
you can and a lot of games catch (69:46 - 69:49)
everything and that appears in the first (69:48 - 69:52)
round 100 of the time no battling just (69:49 - 69:52)
check a ball (69:52 - 69:55)
yeah like it's it's not that much of a (69:52 - 69:57)
stretch also we don't know what the (69:55 - 69:58)
battle system (69:57 - 69:59)
[Music] (69:58 - 70:02)
is like if you are able to if you do (69:59 - 70:04)
have to do a weakening attack and then (70:02 - 70:06)
catch it on the harder ones (70:04 - 70:08)
like we have no and that was also my (70:06 - 70:09)
response (70:08 - 70:12)
right it was like maybe the small ones (70:09 - 70:14)
you can just throw a pokeball and it (70:12 - 70:16)
will catch but maybe the larger ones you (70:14 - 70:18)
do have to have a partner pokemon to (70:16 - 70:20)
battle it and bring it down and then we (70:18 - 70:21)
catch it (70:20 - 70:24)
one screenshot of that the battle which (70:21 - 70:25)
is a (70:24 - 70:28)
glade versa guard chomp and it does have (70:25 - 70:30)
false swipe in there which (70:28 - 70:32)
is like the prime catching yeah there (70:30 - 70:34)
was i thought there was a battle scene (70:32 - 70:36)
with a strappeder (70:34 - 70:38)
and there was right but there was no (70:36 - 70:39)
attacks on that screen (70:38 - 70:41)
yeah you couldn't see what the choice is (70:39 - 70:42)
attached (70:41 - 70:47)
the glade is level 70. it has 213 hp (70:42 - 70:49)
it knows slash 20 out of 20. i'll swipe (70:47 - 70:50)
40 out of 40. (70:49 - 70:53)
close combat 5 out of 5 aerial ace 20 (70:50 - 70:54)
out of 20 and they're (70:53 - 70:57)
against a wild guard chomp um (70:54 - 70:59)
and then there's another screenshot with (70:57 - 71:03)
like two jinxes or shinx's not jinxes (70:59 - 71:03)
i like how he catches one of them and (71:05 - 71:08)
the other one is just completely (71:06 - 71:10)
oblivious (71:08 - 71:13)
my buddy just disappeared but all right (71:10 - 71:15)
i guess this is my life now my best (71:13 - 71:16)
friend is gone (71:15 - 71:18)
i have another two things i feel like if (71:16 - 71:19)
we rename this podcast it'll be (71:18 - 71:22)
steve has two things two things one two (71:19 - 71:23)
things steve (71:22 - 71:26)
one i don't care about graphics in a (71:23 - 71:27)
video game (71:26 - 71:29)
as long as the game is good i want to (71:27 - 71:30)
really stress that like (71:29 - 71:33)
if the game looks bad but still plays (71:30 - 71:34)
super well (71:33 - 71:36)
i don't really care uh i know we can (71:34 - 71:38)
point to the trees and sword and shield (71:36 - 71:39)
that still comes up from which i think (71:38 - 71:42)
are fantastic yeah i i mean graphics can (71:39 - 71:45)
ruin a game for me (71:42 - 71:48)
but i i i would say that the art style (71:45 - 71:49)
in (71:48 - 71:51)
the pokemon legends arceus i i love the (71:49 - 71:52)
art style i love (71:51 - 71:54)
this kind of like we're doing almost (71:52 - 71:56)
like a painted (71:54 - 71:59)
brush-painted uh interpretation of the (71:56 - 72:00)
world i (71:59 - 72:02)
i think that is beautiful and and really (72:00 - 72:04)
goes along with the theme (72:02 - 72:07)
of uh this is a historical not a modern (72:04 - 72:08)
game i would say for most (72:07 - 72:09)
people as long as the game is good (72:08 - 72:11)
graphics don't matter i mean if you look (72:09 - 72:12)
at some of the top games out there (72:11 - 72:15)
minecraft it's literally blocks roblox (72:12 - 72:16)
is (72:15 - 72:19)
whatever roblox is trying to do like i (72:16 - 72:21)
mean graphics is (72:19 - 72:24)
so graphics isn't like always the make (72:21 - 72:25)
or break (72:24 - 72:27)
but if it's got really really bad (72:25 - 72:29)
graphics and there's (72:27 - 72:33)
it's okay to play then i will (72:29 - 72:36)
not like the graphic graphics are often (72:33 - 72:37)
what get me through the door like this (72:36 - 72:38)
looks super cute (72:37 - 72:40)
like there are a million board games (72:38 - 72:41)
that i bought because i just love the (72:40 - 72:43)
art and the gameplay is terrible (72:41 - 72:44)
there are a lot of games that i bought (72:43 - 72:46)
because i thought the art was really (72:44 - 72:46)
great (72:46 - 72:50)
and and you're like this game is bad (72:46 - 72:52)
but there's a lot of games where people (72:50 - 72:53)
had to convince (72:52 - 72:56)
me to buy and play the game (72:53 - 72:59)
because the art turned me off so much (72:56 - 72:59)
like i just (72:59 - 73:01)
have no interest in playing the game (72:59 - 73:04)
because i have to watch myself play it (73:01 - 73:07)
i have to be confronted with this art (73:04 - 73:09)
over and over and over again (73:07 - 73:12)
so if i really don't like the art (73:09 - 73:15)
knowing that as a visual medium this is (73:12 - 73:17)
what i have to look at that can turn me (73:15 - 73:18)
off from buying a game (73:17 - 73:20)
i i you know and i can say like my (73:18 - 73:21)
experience of that (73:20 - 73:23)
now that like thinking about it has (73:21 - 73:24)
brought this to mind (73:23 - 73:28)
right i love monster hunter games (73:24 - 73:30)
the nintendo monster hunter games (73:28 - 73:32)
they're bright they're colorful (73:30 - 73:34)
they're the weapons and everything it's (73:32 - 73:35)
fanciful (73:34 - 73:37)
and you know just you know there's like (73:35 - 73:38)
a bit of humor in there (73:37 - 73:41)
and they're just like that's a huge draw (73:38 - 73:42)
for me (73:41 - 73:44)
and then there was monster hunter world (73:42 - 73:45)
which was drab (73:44 - 73:49)
and like everything was just so like (73:45 - 73:51)
boring and it's like yeah you could tell (73:49 - 73:52)
that this weapon was made out of this (73:51 - 73:54)
particular monster's parts but it's just (73:52 - 73:55)
like (73:54 - 73:58)
not and and i lost interest in monster (73:55 - 74:00)
hunter world because (73:58 - 74:04)
it didn't have that like characteristic (74:00 - 74:07)
you know bright colorful playful nature (74:04 - 74:09)
that other monster hunter games have had (74:07 - 74:11)
so i can see like how the art style (74:09 - 74:14)
does influence my pleasure in playing (74:11 - 74:15)
the game (74:14 - 74:18)
in those ways so (74:15 - 74:21)
with the foundation laid that i'm not i (74:18 - 74:23)
don't care like if the i (74:21 - 74:27)
i think this game looks bad graphically (74:23 - 74:29)
right now right now i think it looks bad (74:27 - 74:30)
um but (74:29 - 74:33)
if the game was to ship and still look (74:30 - 74:35)
like it did today (74:33 - 74:37)
i would still buy it and play it with (74:35 - 74:39)
the hope that the gameplay is good right (74:37 - 74:40)
so that's that's all i want to say like (74:39 - 74:42)
right i do when they showed the trailer (74:40 - 74:43)
and they showed the trainer running (74:42 - 74:45)
through the very empty town with (74:43 - 74:47)
five identical buildings the only thing (74:45 - 74:49)
different was the roof (74:47 - 74:53)
um and then like this town is deserted (74:49 - 74:55)
there are five buildings they're all the (74:53 - 74:57)
same they (74:55 - 74:59)
it doesn't look great even though (74:57 - 75:01)
because something going on (74:59 - 75:03)
waking up at five o'clock in the morning (75:01 - 75:05)
before anybody else has woken up and (75:03 - 75:06)
that (75:05 - 75:09)
you oh you can't then the entire story (75:06 - 75:11)
then they show them in the field and you (75:09 - 75:13)
see like a chingling and it's like (75:11 - 75:16)
like one pixel up two pixels over two (75:13 - 75:17)
pixels it's (75:16 - 75:20)
very stuttery um the trees look just as (75:17 - 75:22)
bad as they did in sword and shield (75:20 - 75:23)
which is not a two-year-old game (75:22 - 75:26)
this is great (75:23 - 75:26)
visually it was not impressive to me and (75:28 - 75:32)
i couldn't help (75:31 - 75:33)
think about that and now i kind of feel (75:32 - 75:35)
like those people who saw sword and (75:33 - 75:36)
shield for the first time and they were (75:35 - 75:37)
like (75:36 - 75:39)
oh this why doesn't this look as good as (75:37 - 75:40)
other nintendo games but that being said (75:39 - 75:41)
like (75:40 - 75:43)
i get it the game is a year out they (75:41 - 75:45)
have plenty of time to improve (75:43 - 75:48)
yeah but it was hard for me to be (75:45 - 75:50)
excited about a game where they showed (75:48 - 75:53)
90 seconds of in my opinion very (75:50 - 75:54)
mediocre footage (75:53 - 75:57)
i think the the the the idea (75:54 - 75:59)
the the idea that they're trying to (75:57 - 76:01)
convey got to me (75:59 - 76:04)
they're trying to do this vast um world (76:01 - 76:06)
where you can just explore you can roll (76:04 - 76:08)
seamless battles like that got through (76:06 - 76:10)
to me but it was just (76:08 - 76:11)
hard for me to be excited when i don't (76:10 - 76:14)
think that visually (76:11 - 76:17)
um this looked really like i think (76:14 - 76:20)
the very first trailer for (76:17 - 76:23)
sword and shield was a better first (76:20 - 76:25)
impression (76:23 - 76:27)
of a game freak game like i think that (76:25 - 76:29)
first trailer of sword and shield sorry (76:27 - 76:31)
seeing sir chester with the snowfall (76:29 - 76:34)
seeing that um halloween field with the (76:31 - 76:37)
yampers and the yellow grass (76:34 - 76:39)
seeing squirrel bunny on route one i i (76:37 - 76:41)
thought that actually looked great (76:39 - 76:42)
and it was really exciting and this was (76:41 - 76:44)
before the national deck so everyone was (76:42 - 76:46)
excited for that opening sword and (76:44 - 76:48)
shield um (76:46 - 76:50)
but when i looked at this game i was (76:48 - 76:52)
like wow that chingling is barely moving (76:50 - 76:54)
oh that star raptor is like stuttering (76:52 - 76:55)
in the background oh that grass doesn't (76:54 - 76:59)
over interpret man (76:55 - 76:59)
but you can't but oh (76:59 - 77:05)
but there's only like 60 seconds of (77:03 - 77:06)
footage like there's not a lot to really (77:05 - 77:07)
look at (77:06 - 77:10)
it's it still got me super excited i was (77:07 - 77:10)
like (77:10 - 77:12)
when they like for me honestly when they (77:10 - 77:14)
were doing like the hand painting of the (77:12 - 77:16)
piplup on the beach with this feels i (77:14 - 77:17)
was like i mean (77:16 - 77:20)
i mean yeah but that's not the game like (77:17 - 77:22)
i think (77:20 - 77:24)
yeah yeah i know that's not the game but (77:22 - 77:26)
still sold me on the game (77:24 - 77:28)
yeah it did yeah it's like boy they've (77:26 - 77:30)
got the right concept (77:28 - 77:31)
yeah they know what they're doing yeah (77:30 - 77:33)
like the splatters and the (77:31 - 77:35)
brush strokes and everything i get it i (77:33 - 77:37)
get it i would honestly say like (77:35 - 77:40)
for anybody who really needs a reference (77:37 - 77:41)
on this (77:40 - 77:43)
it was it was the sun and moon games i'm (77:41 - 77:44)
sure (77:43 - 77:46)
you can find a record somewhere where (77:44 - 77:47)
people have done (77:46 - 77:50)
side by side of like here is this (77:47 - 77:53)
scene from the first trailer of this (77:50 - 77:54)
game (77:53 - 77:56)
here is the scene from the last trailer (77:54 - 77:58)
of the game and you can see the (77:56 - 77:59)
improvements (77:58 - 78:00)
that they know i have no doubt that this (77:59 - 78:02)
game is going to look significantly (78:00 - 78:03)
better when it chips (78:02 - 78:04)
yeah i'm just saying as a first (78:03 - 78:07)
impression for me i saw people get (78:04 - 78:08)
really excited (78:07 - 78:09)
you know you hear statements like this (78:08 - 78:10)
is going to be the best pokemon game (78:09 - 78:12)
ever and oh my gosh they're finally (78:10 - 78:13)
doing it (78:12 - 78:15)
and some people screaming mmo even (78:13 - 78:16)
though it's (78:15 - 78:20)
not not yet not with that attitude (78:16 - 78:23)
but i'm just (78:20 - 78:27)
more optimistically cautious (78:23 - 78:30)
because if the best game at this point (78:27 - 78:33)
that we have gotten from game freak (78:30 - 78:36)
is sword and shield which i think so i (78:33 - 78:36)
think from (78:36 - 78:39)
uh like you know they already proved the (78:36 - 78:40)
open world part (78:39 - 78:44)
of sword and shield (78:40 - 78:46)
they have done some really good (78:44 - 78:48)
animations in sword and shield like (78:46 - 78:51)
hyper beam pyroball (78:48 - 78:51)
the quality of life in sword and shield (78:53 - 78:57)
is pretty much unmatched of any other (78:55 - 78:58)
pokemon game (78:57 - 79:01)
of what you can do but it's not like (78:58 - 79:03)
game freak overnight turned into rock (79:01 - 79:06)
star or turned into bungie (79:03 - 79:09)
or turned into like these these triple a (79:06 - 79:11)
studios (79:09 - 79:14)
it's still game freak and we know what (79:11 - 79:15)
game freak has (79:14 - 79:17)
we we if there's anything we know for (79:15 - 79:19)
game freak we've seen their whole (79:17 - 79:21)
catalog of video games (79:19 - 79:25)
from harmonite to uh tembo (79:21 - 79:28)
to little town hero we've seen don't (79:25 - 79:30)
forget pocket card jockey their best (79:28 - 79:31)
game (79:30 - 79:35)
by far we have we have seen every single (79:31 - 79:36)
game they have made (79:35 - 79:39)
so to go from people saying sword and (79:36 - 79:40)
shield was bad or sword and shield was (79:39 - 79:43)
not as good as diamond and pearl too (79:40 - 79:44)
this is going to be the best pokemon (79:43 - 79:47)
game it's very hard for me to be like (79:44 - 79:50)
yeah i hope i hope so i hope that this (79:47 - 79:52)
is the best pokemon game they ever do (79:50 - 79:57)
uh but from what they showed me (79:52 - 80:00)
and the rest of the world (79:57 - 80:03)
i'm just cautious about it like i i hope (80:00 - 80:04)
it's great (80:03 - 80:06)
yes that's fine yeah be cautiously (80:04 - 80:08)
optimistic that's acceptable (80:06 - 80:10)
the one of the keys of happiness is (80:08 - 80:13)
managing your expectations (80:10 - 80:16)
right yeah yeah i will also say as i (80:13 - 80:17)
know what video games i like (80:16 - 80:19)
i'm 32 years old i've played a lot of (80:17 - 80:21)
video games i know which ones i like i (80:19 - 80:22)
know which ones i don't like (80:21 - 80:24)
action rpg the first thing that comes to (80:22 - 80:25)
mind is bayonetta (80:24 - 80:29)
near automata um (80:25 - 80:29)
why am i not blight why am i blanking a (80:29 - 80:33)
devil may cry these are action rpgs that (80:31 - 80:34)
i've played before and i (80:33 - 80:36)
simply didn't like them i don't think (80:34 - 80:37)
they're bad games they're just not the (80:36 - 80:39)
type of games i like (80:37 - 80:42)
i like pokemon things so if this is a (80:39 - 80:43)
good (80:42 - 80:45)
version of that it will get me through i (80:43 - 80:46)
will probably (80:45 - 80:48)
i probably would say final fantasy xv is (80:46 - 80:50)
an action rpg (80:48 - 80:51)
i hated battle i hated the combat in (80:50 - 80:53)
that game but (80:51 - 80:54)
because i love the world of final (80:53 - 80:56)
fantasy um (80:54 - 80:58)
and because i really did enjoy the final (80:56 - 81:00)
fantasy i love the four boy (80:58 - 81:02)
band going through in their leather (81:00 - 81:03)
outfits in the desert (81:02 - 81:05)
to you know save the kingdom it really (81:03 - 81:08)
for whatever reason got to me i liked it (81:05 - 81:09)
i was very satisfied it pushed me (81:08 - 81:11)
through i'll (81:09 - 81:12)
like i think the pokemon itself will (81:11 - 81:15)
push me through but usually for me (81:12 - 81:18)
not a huge fan of action rpgs in general (81:15 - 81:18)
yeah i mean (81:18 - 81:20)
if that's the same like i don't like (81:18 - 81:21)
first person shooters but i love the (81:20 - 81:23)
bioshock series (81:21 - 81:24)
like because the story in the world of (81:23 - 81:26)
bioshock was so great (81:24 - 81:28)
that i didn't hate the fact that it was (81:26 - 81:30)
a first person shooter (81:28 - 81:35)
um so like we still don't really know (81:30 - 81:36)
what action rpg (81:35 - 81:40)
means in this context like we don't (81:36 - 81:42)
the fact that they bring up the moves (81:40 - 81:44)
but there's not like a counter (81:42 - 81:46)
or timing thing there's a lot of (81:44 - 81:47)
questions (81:46 - 81:51)
about what what they mean by action rpg (81:47 - 81:51)
and we (81:51 - 81:53)
i mean there's so little information to (81:51 - 81:56)
make a lot of judgments off of it (81:53 - 81:59)
is very premature all we know is (81:56 - 82:02)
they're going back in time there's a (81:59 - 82:04)
whole collection aspect (82:02 - 82:07)
and that that has me hooked that is a (82:04 - 82:10)
thing that i like (82:07 - 82:14)
i also hope that (82:10 - 82:17)
what was the other thing i saw like oh (82:14 - 82:17)
this is game (82:17 - 82:19)
this is game freak setting the (82:17 - 82:21)
foundation for future pokemon games (82:19 - 82:23)
didn't didn't they not like they've (82:21 - 82:25)
already proven the wild area (82:23 - 82:28)
like they've already done the open world (82:25 - 82:29)
if anything (82:28 - 82:32)
this is this is like them expanding on (82:29 - 82:36)
the open world part of the wild area (82:32 - 82:38)
uh and so what i'm saying is this is (82:36 - 82:39)
more of (82:38 - 82:41)
like them putting their stake in the (82:39 - 82:42)
ground and saying (82:41 - 82:46)
expect wild area is pokemon game (82:42 - 82:49)
not tall grass (82:46 - 82:49)
yeah and i think that's like if every if (82:49 - 82:57)
gen 9 was all wild area (82:53 - 83:00)
i'd be cool with that like i i genuinely (82:57 - 83:00)
like (83:00 - 83:02)
seeing the pokemon walk around i like (83:00 - 83:03)
being able to avoid them i (83:02 - 83:05)
i think it does make the world feel (83:03 - 83:07)
lively that's why i do like (83:05 - 83:08)
most of my time in sword and shield (83:07 - 83:10)
right now is an isle of armor i know (83:08 - 83:12)
some people like crown tundra better (83:10 - 83:14)
but i really do like the isle of armor (83:12 - 83:16)
and i like exploring it and it's it's my (83:14 - 83:18)
favorite area to wander around still and (83:16 - 83:19)
seeing (83:18 - 83:22)
those different biomes um (83:19 - 83:25)
i i hope that when i look at this (83:22 - 83:27)
trailer and it's like oh there's you (83:25 - 83:29)
only see two pokemon and there's (83:27 - 83:31)
vast canyons behind you and it's like oh (83:29 - 83:33)
gosh i hope there's something more out (83:31 - 83:33)
there (83:33 - 83:38)
uh i i hope that's there also (83:33 - 83:38)
just because the game is open world (83:38 - 83:41)
doesn't mean it's good (83:40 - 83:44)
i don't also understand this like i have (83:41 - 83:46)
played plenty of open world games that (83:44 - 83:47)
the open world part was (83:46 - 83:50)
not a necessity uh like no more heroes (83:47 - 83:52)
no more heroes too those were open world (83:50 - 83:53)
games and (83:52 - 83:55)
yeah i guess you could walk around and (83:53 - 83:56)
but there was nothing to do in it (83:55 - 83:58)
because it gives me the freedom to be (83:56 - 84:03)
me i don't have the man telling (83:58 - 84:03)
here's the bigger question (84:04 - 84:09)
do you think you get to you do you think (84:07 - 84:11)
you get to customize your trainer (84:09 - 84:14)
in uh the legend game i (84:11 - 84:19)
hope so yeah no (84:14 - 84:22)
no i don't yeah why not because there's (84:19 - 84:24)
no rules you're the first person (84:22 - 84:27)
you're gonna wear traditional garb okay (84:24 - 84:28)
you're gonna find (84:27 - 84:30)
an ursa ring you're going to carve it up (84:28 - 84:32)
with your guard chomp and then you're (84:30 - 84:34)
going to have like a (84:32 - 84:35)
like monster hunter you get aware of the (84:34 - 84:38)
ring pokemon monster hunter crossover (84:35 - 84:38)
i'm (84:38 - 84:41)
in uh final fantasy 15 i said earlier (84:38 - 84:42)
one of my favorite games ever (84:41 - 84:45)
completely open world that was probably (84:42 - 84:47)
the worst part of final fantasy 15 there (84:45 - 84:48)
was nothing to do (84:47 - 84:50)
you could you could you could walk from (84:48 - 84:53)
the the garage to the beach and it would (84:50 - 84:55)
probably actually take you two hours to (84:53 - 84:57)
walk that (84:55 - 84:59)
but there was real life nothing to do in (84:57 - 85:01)
between that's why you just took the car (84:59 - 85:02)
and the car would take (85:01 - 85:04)
10 minutes instead of two hours i'm not (85:02 - 85:06)
even exaggerating the car would legit (85:04 - 85:08)
take 10 minutes to drive from point a to (85:06 - 85:10)
point b and you would go make a sandwich (85:08 - 85:11)
and come back and you're like (85:10 - 85:13)
yeah i'm just here with my boy bands (85:11 - 85:15)
sweating and leather in this car waiting (85:13 - 85:18)
like open where there's (85:15 - 85:22)
no there's no slimes in there (85:18 - 85:22)
i mean i'm playing gungeon impact and (85:23 - 85:28)
there's plenty of slimes in that game (85:25 - 85:28)
uh i hope this game is good though i i (85:29 - 85:33)
will never (85:32 - 85:35)
fault a video game company for trying (85:33 - 85:36)
something new they're trying something (85:35 - 85:37)
new here (85:36 - 85:41)
i i also don't expect that this is like (85:37 - 85:43)
i saw people being like talking about (85:41 - 85:45)
the sequels to this (85:43 - 85:47)
like oh this is just the foundation but (85:45 - 85:48)
i can't wait for (85:47 - 85:52)
the legends groudon or like (85:48 - 85:54)
whoa this game is a year away it's not (85:52 - 85:56)
even out yet why are we talking about (85:54 - 85:58)
sequels to this game i mean we're (85:56 - 86:00)
talking about it because much like me (85:58 - 86:03)
i would be very excited to explore the (86:00 - 86:04)
histories of (86:03 - 86:06)
all of the regions yeah yeah sure that's (86:04 - 86:08)
a very exciting thing like if this is a (86:06 - 86:10)
really good game and we're exploring the (86:08 - 86:11)
history of cinno (86:10 - 86:14)
i really then want to explore all of the (86:11 - 86:15)
other regions (86:14 - 86:17)
and that is that is an exciting idea (86:15 - 86:19)
well i mean all of them except hoenn (86:17 - 86:21)
because nobody wants to go back to well (86:19 - 86:23)
i hear that people (86:21 - 86:26)
really like kanto and want more kanto (86:23 - 86:30)
nobody wants more kanto (86:26 - 86:30)
no one we've been there five million (86:30 - 86:34)
times (86:33 - 86:37)
okay we just did a whole tour we did do (86:34 - 86:38)
a whole tour (86:37 - 86:39)
you know what's coming it's coming (86:38 - 86:41)
sooner than later though is (86:39 - 86:45)
brilliant diamond shining pearl (86:41 - 86:47)
so excited i'm so excited i believe the (86:45 - 86:49)
pokemon company partnered with (86:47 - 86:53)
uh with i love computer art (86:49 - 86:53)
i was gonna say duplo uh oh (86:54 - 87:01)
no to okay (86:58 - 87:05)
so the adventure of pokemon diamond (87:01 - 87:06)
brilliant diamond shining pro will take (87:05 - 87:07)
place in the center region rich with the (87:06 - 87:09)
nature of mount cornet towering at the (87:07 - 87:10)
heart (87:09 - 87:12)
uh you will visit many different (87:10 - 87:14)
locations to become the champion of the (87:12 - 87:15)
pokemon (87:14 - 87:18)
league uh the over the original story (87:15 - 87:19)
has faithfully (87:18 - 87:21)
faithfully been reproduced sense of (87:19 - 87:23)
scale of the original towns have been (87:21 - 87:25)
carefully preserved (87:23 - 87:28)
um you can relive familiar scenes (87:25 - 87:30)
for those setting out for cinna for the (87:28 - 87:32)
first time plenty of new encounters and (87:30 - 87:33)
surprises (87:32 - 87:36)
await the remakes include easy to (87:33 - 87:38)
understand player friendly conveniences (87:36 - 87:40)
of a modern pokemon series plus up to (87:38 - 87:44)
close personal pokemon battle scenes (87:40 - 87:47)
a couple things that they've shown they (87:44 - 87:48)
only really showed (87:47 - 87:50)
like two routes i think they showed the (87:48 - 87:52)
original route where you get your (87:50 - 87:53)
starter pokemon and then i think they (87:52 - 87:55)
showed the route where shanks and b doof (87:53 - 87:56)
spawn (87:55 - 87:59)
um they showed that first town that you (87:56 - 88:00)
go to they showed the (87:59 - 88:02)
bottom part of snow point where i think (88:00 - 88:04)
the boat is (88:02 - 88:07)
um they showed the factory the factory (88:04 - 88:08)
and they showed (88:07 - 88:10)
what looks like the underground oh they (88:08 - 88:11)
wait they showed (88:10 - 88:14)
the the blown up lake with the dead (88:11 - 88:15)
magikarp yeah they did show that yeah (88:14 - 88:17)
the best part of the game according to (88:15 - 88:17)
some people (88:17 - 88:20)
that is the best part of the game that (88:17 - 88:23)
is the surprises they were talking about (88:20 - 88:25)
um (88:23 - 88:25)
so we have to talk about the art style (88:26 - 88:30)
first that like that is the biggest (88:28 - 88:32)
point of contention whether people like (88:30 - 88:32)
it or hate it (88:32 - 88:36)
and um oh it's like i just wait i just i (88:32 - 88:37)
just (88:36 - 88:40)
love the whole it's like i want gen 4 (88:37 - 88:40)
remakes (88:40 - 88:43)
i want gen 4 remakes i watch it these (88:40 - 88:44)
are not the remakes that i'm not like (88:43 - 88:46)
this (88:44 - 88:49)
uh i will start as a person who is (88:46 - 88:50)
incredibly (88:49 - 88:53)
excited about the art style uh i love (88:50 - 88:56)
the fact that they kept the (88:53 - 88:57)
the fact that you're chibi in the (88:56 - 88:59)
overworld and full size in the battle (88:57 - 89:03)
just like in 100 100 that's (88:59 - 89:06)
100 percent stamp stamp stamp endorsed (89:03 - 89:07)
endorsed endorsements (89:06 - 89:08)
they were like that the original games (89:07 - 89:10)
you shrunk down and you walked around (89:08 - 89:11)
the world in chibi form (89:10 - 89:13)
i think the chibi form here is (89:11 - 89:15)
incredibly cute (89:13 - 89:17)
i think it's an incredibly cute art (89:15 - 89:18)
style i (89:17 - 89:21)
i like the fact that they kept it as a (89:18 - 89:22)
as a faithful (89:21 - 89:26)
nod to the original games (89:22 - 89:29)
i i i 100 i was like i can have (89:26 - 89:32)
my nostalgia in an updated and (89:29 - 89:36)
fun to look at manner right (89:32 - 89:39)
like this is like everything i want (89:36 - 89:42)
from a remake i want it to have that (89:39 - 89:43)
same (89:42 - 89:46)
cute feel the same honestly even the (89:43 - 89:47)
same (89:46 - 89:50)
grid movement that you had in the (89:47 - 89:51)
original games (89:50 - 89:52)
i don't think there's grid because you (89:51 - 89:54)
can see dawn go sideways in the snow (89:52 - 89:55)
part (89:54 - 89:58)
i mean it looks like it looks i mean the (89:55 - 90:00)
whole layout looks like (89:58 - 90:02)
everything is squares right it's just (90:00 - 90:04)
like (90:02 - 90:07)
i am not the the words (90:04 - 90:10)
faithful remake is the thing that (90:07 - 90:11)
bothers me (90:10 - 90:13)
because like what part of it bothers you (90:11 - 90:14)
faithful would be (90:13 - 90:17)
hey do you remember 17 hms you needed to (90:14 - 90:19)
get through mount cornett (90:17 - 90:21)
well we're keeping it faithful so yeah (90:19 - 90:23)
the reason i think that they're (90:21 - 90:25)
saying that is because i i think that (90:23 - 90:26)
they (90:25 - 90:30)
really want to set the foundation for (90:26 - 90:33)
you are going to be able to capture (90:30 - 90:36)
use have access to pokemon that were (90:33 - 90:37)
available (90:36 - 90:41)
in diamond and pearl yeah no alolan (90:37 - 90:42)
pokemon (90:41 - 90:45)
no kayla's pokemon (90:42 - 90:49)
no unova pokemon that this is (90:45 - 90:52)
yeah this is a diamond pearl remake kids (90:49 - 90:53)
and you're going to get (90:52 - 90:54)
what was available in diamond in pearl i (90:53 - 90:57)
i respect that decision when they if if (90:54 - 90:57)
they (90:57 - 90:59)
if they start making a remake of any (90:57 - 91:01)
pokemon game or any game in general and (90:59 - 91:01)
they say (91:01 - 91:03)
look this is the direction we're going (91:01 - 91:04)
from day one i respect it (91:03 - 91:07)
the problem i had with auras is it (91:04 - 91:09)
wasn't a faithful it wasn't a complete (91:07 - 91:10)
faithful remake (91:09 - 91:12)
and it wasn't a complete overhauled (91:10 - 91:13)
remake like um (91:12 - 91:17)
final fantasy 7 remake is i think (91:13 - 91:20)
we i think we're mistaking faithful with (91:17 - 91:21)
exact (91:20 - 91:23)
faithful is remaining true to the (91:21 - 91:24)
original faithful (91:23 - 91:27)
is remaining in the spirit of the (91:24 - 91:29)
original there's nothing about (91:27 - 91:32)
faithful that says it's exact they never (91:29 - 91:35)
say it's exact and they even say there (91:32 - 91:36)
are life improvements in the press (91:35 - 91:37)
release (91:36 - 91:39)
like there's nothing about the word (91:37 - 91:41)
faithful that is saying (91:39 - 91:44)
this is a one-for-one complete remake (91:41 - 91:47)
it is keeping in the spirit (91:44 - 91:51)
of and true to how the original was (91:47 - 91:53)
that doesn't mean they aren't making (91:51 - 91:55)
changes that doesn't mean that we (91:53 - 91:58)
will automatically have hms that doesn't (91:55 - 91:58)
mean (91:58 - 92:01)
that the end game will won't be (91:58 - 92:04)
completely different or won't be (92:01 - 92:06)
uh from platinum it means that they are (92:04 - 92:08)
not (92:06 - 92:11)
they aren't like the plot line is going (92:08 - 92:12)
to be the same they aren't (92:11 - 92:15)
they aren't just saying now here's (92:12 - 92:17)
jordan shields dlc (92:15 - 92:20)
sinnoh like they are completely changing (92:17 - 92:22)
the game they are remaining (92:20 - 92:24)
faithful to the things that were (92:22 - 92:25)
originally part (92:24 - 92:28)
of diamond and pearl that (92:25 - 92:32)
does not exclude quality of life changes (92:28 - 92:34)
additional pokemon other things being (92:32 - 92:35)
added to the game (92:34 - 92:37)
yeah they're just part of what they're (92:35 - 92:39)
showing is they're saying very faithful (92:37 - 92:42)
to the art style of the original game (92:39 - 92:44)
like that's what like it isn't exact (92:42 - 92:45)
like it is a (92:44 - 92:48)
a new rendering of the chibi models and (92:45 - 92:50)
it is a new rendering of the world (92:48 - 92:53)
yeah but it still has the look and feel (92:50 - 92:54)
of those original (92:53 - 92:56)
games i think that's what they mean by (92:54 - 92:57)
faithful sure (92:56 - 93:00)
my worries are and they're they're (92:57 - 93:01)
they're petty (93:00 - 93:03)
but like i like customizing characters (93:01 - 93:04)
if you're saying it's faithful (93:03 - 93:06)
are we getting it are we stuck with dawn (93:04 - 93:10)
kidding yeah (93:06 - 93:10)
don and the other guy dave don and dave (93:15 - 93:20)
don and dave my two favorite pokemon (93:18 - 93:22)
protagonists uh (93:20 - 93:27)
like it is i know it's so important to (93:22 - 93:27)
people (93:27 - 93:29)
when when they play games to be (93:27 - 93:31)
themselves and in pokemon (93:29 - 93:34)
that is a game where you are yourself (93:31 - 93:37)
you are for better or worse picking your (93:34 - 93:39)
favorite pokemon going through with your (93:37 - 93:41)
journey having your experiences (93:39 - 93:44)
and to x and y that was a huge factor (93:41 - 93:46)
of being like i can be black for the (93:44 - 93:48)
first time i can be latino for the first (93:46 - 93:50)
time i can (93:48 - 93:53)
wear a hat or not wear a hat or put on a (93:50 - 93:55)
pink jacket instead of a green jacket (93:53 - 93:57)
that adds a ton of immersion for people (93:55 - 93:59)
going through a game (93:57 - 94:03)
and it was a turn off for auras for me (93:59 - 94:03)
to be like (94:03 - 94:06)
i gotta be brendan brendan's lame i'm (94:03 - 94:07)
not lame (94:06 - 94:09)
i'm cool (94:07 - 94:09)
so like you can you can remake (94:11 - 94:20)
a game like let's go pikachu let's go (94:16 - 94:20)
eevee (94:20 - 94:23)
what was that dude's name chase trace (94:20 - 94:23)
what i was (94:23 - 94:26)
saying chase tracelane but i was still (94:23 - 94:28)
able to customize myself so i didn't (94:26 - 94:31)
have to feel like chase or trace i can't (94:28 - 94:32)
even remember which one's the rival or (94:31 - 94:33)
not right (94:32 - 94:35)
if i wanted to wear a team rocket (94:33 - 94:36)
uniform and put a (94:35 - 94:39)
safari hat on my evie i could do that (94:36 - 94:40)
and that felt like me (94:39 - 94:43)
um because my eevee is always out there (94:40 - 94:44)
safariing (94:43 - 94:47)
uh so like like no character with (94:44 - 94:49)
customizations a big bummer (94:47 - 94:51)
and i feel like that's a step backwards (94:49 - 94:53)
again they already (94:51 - 94:55)
went a step backwards and omega ruby (94:53 - 94:57)
alpha sapphire omega ruby alpha sapphire (94:55 - 94:58)
was like (94:57 - 94:59)
hey we're we're going to stick you with (94:58 - 95:01)
hm's again (94:59 - 95:03)
and rock smash is not an hm but you (95:01 - 95:05)
needed rock smash to go from gym 3 to (95:03 - 95:07)
gym 4 to get to flannery and you needed (95:05 - 95:08)
it every time (95:07 - 95:11)
like that's a step back uh no pokemon in (95:08 - 95:12)
the overworld (95:11 - 95:16)
could happen probably not remember when (95:12 - 95:17)
they first (95:16 - 95:18)
showed sword and shield they did not (95:17 - 95:20)
show wandering pokemon it wasn't until (95:18 - 95:21)
the second trailer four months later (95:20 - 95:23)
where they showed wandering pokemon (95:21 - 95:25)
and we complained about that on the show (95:23 - 95:27)
we were like how can they go from let's (95:25 - 95:28)
go pikachu let's go eevee literally the (95:27 - 95:30)
best feature of let's go pikachu let's (95:28 - 95:31)
go eat (95:30 - 95:33)
and how can they take that away and i (95:31 - 95:34)
called it right (95:33 - 95:35)
you're all like no they wouldn't have a (95:34 - 95:37)
mixture and i said yes they will and (95:35 - 95:38)
you're like no they won't and i was (95:37 - 95:41)
right you were right education (95:38 - 95:42)
could they have wandering pokemon in (95:41 - 95:44)
here yeah sure they could do anything (95:42 - 95:45)
it's their video game (95:44 - 95:47)
uh but going back on that feels like i (95:45 - 95:48)
don't want that either (95:47 - 95:51)
like i i do want to walk around the (95:48 - 95:52)
zubats because we know mount cornett is (95:51 - 95:54)
full of zubats (95:52 - 95:57)
i want to not walk into them um (95:54 - 96:00)
so that i'm i'm worried in that sense (95:57 - 96:02)
is that going are these things going to (96:00 - 96:03)
prevent me from buying the game no (96:02 - 96:04)
because like (96:03 - 96:05)
i've played through sinnoh multiple (96:04 - 96:06)
times i play i think platinum is the (96:05 - 96:08)
better game like if i had a choice (96:06 - 96:11)
i'm going to platinum uh but (96:08 - 96:14)
i would miss those things a lot (96:11 - 96:16)
and i think though like those things (96:14 - 96:18)
being able to customize your character (96:16 - 96:20)
and seeing pokemon in the overworld for (96:18 - 96:22)
me adds (96:20 - 96:26)
so much immersion to a series i love (96:22 - 96:26)
well are we ready for true confession (96:26 - 96:29)
time (96:28 - 96:33)
yes i only played pokemon diamond (96:29 - 96:35)
to complete my living decks i didn't (96:33 - 96:37)
really pay attention to the story i kind (96:35 - 96:39)
of rushed it (96:37 - 96:44)
uh so this will be my first visit (96:39 - 96:46)
with actually caring diamond diamond was (96:44 - 96:48)
the first (96:46 - 96:49)
time i ever completed the pokedex like i (96:48 - 96:51)
have very fond memories of diamonds so (96:49 - 96:52)
i'm going to buy (96:51 - 96:53)
brilliant diamonds yeah i i needed to (96:52 - 96:55)
move my uh (96:53 - 96:57)
pokemon off of my pokemon emerald (96:55 - 96:58)
cartridge up (96:57 - 97:01)
so yeah that's why i played pokemon (96:58 - 97:02)
diamond (97:01 - 97:06)
i mean looking at how they do (97:02 - 97:09)
a lot of remakes (97:06 - 97:10)
i i don't think we're getting (97:09 - 97:12)
customization i don't think we're (97:10 - 97:14)
getting overworld we don't (97:12 - 97:17)
know for sure true um (97:14 - 97:20)
they like to hide those things again (97:17 - 97:22)
manage your expectations they really (97:20 - 97:24)
haven't done it a lot in the past (97:22 - 97:26)
it's highly doubtful they're going to do (97:24 - 97:28)
it here (97:26 - 97:31)
and right also keep in mind (97:28 - 97:35)
this is not the key focus (97:31 - 97:39)
of new next pokemon (97:35 - 97:41)
pokemon legends arceus is the key focus (97:39 - 97:43)
of new next pokemon (97:41 - 97:46)
this is you guys wanted remakes we paid (97:43 - 97:50)
this company to make mimics (97:46 - 97:50)
we didn't spend gold we spend silver so (97:51 - 97:58)
you get silver so at least in auras you (97:55 - 97:59)
could be unique (97:58 - 98:03)
in your secret bases yes in this game (97:59 - 98:04)
you can be unique in your underground (98:03 - 98:07)
secret bases yeah but in the the like (98:04 - 98:08)
capture the flag the tag (98:07 - 98:10)
they showed a scene of like 16 people in (98:08 - 98:12)
the what what was that that's the wi-fi (98:10 - 98:13)
room (98:12 - 98:16)
union room yeah um like that would (98:13 - 98:19)
be a great place to express yourself hey (98:16 - 98:21)
i'm the dude wearing the green hat (98:19 - 98:23)
uh yeah and you could do that in the old (98:21 - 98:25)
games you picked what your avatar was (98:23 - 98:26)
when you went into that yeah you just (98:25 - 98:27)
picked an avatar you didn't (98:26 - 98:29)
customize yourself right but that (98:27 - 98:31)
doesn't mean that you can't like then (98:29 - 98:32)
are they gonna be not gonna be a part of (98:31 - 98:35)
this the designated text (98:32 - 98:37)
that you can choose like remember they (98:35 - 98:38)
had that (98:37 - 98:43)
yeah i like happy and celebration (98:38 - 98:45)
so there there are some big questions (98:43 - 98:46)
here um (98:45 - 98:49)
the biggest question being like and this (98:46 - 98:50)
kind of goes back to why i think will is (98:49 - 98:52)
wrong about them not doing a gen 9 in (98:50 - 98:54)
the statement of like gen 8 (98:52 - 98:58)
is they have to keep pushing forward (98:54 - 98:59)
this competitive (98:58 - 99:02)
scene so how are they are they going to (98:59 - 99:03)
say hey (99:02 - 99:06)
all competitive for the 2022 (99:03 - 99:08)
world tournament is going to be in the (99:06 - 99:10)
diamond and pro remakes not made by game (99:08 - 99:10)
freak (99:10 - 99:14)
or is it going to be in sword and shield (99:10 - 99:14)
like we don't know that i don't know in (99:14 - 99:18)
the world championship (99:16 - 99:20)
so maybe that's what's the real hot take (99:18 - 99:22)
on what's happening with competitive (99:20 - 99:23)
like we're just done with competitive (99:22 - 99:24)
all together because it's not going to (99:23 - 99:26)
be legends of arceus if you go to the (99:24 - 99:27)
japanese website i think we said this (99:26 - 99:28)
earlier (99:27 - 99:30)
legends of arceus has no online (99:28 - 99:32)
multiplayer at all (99:30 - 99:34)
um diamond and pearl on the japanese (99:32 - 99:37)
website says two to four players (99:34 - 99:39)
so is diamond and pearl going to be the (99:37 - 99:40)
competitive game (99:39 - 99:44)
which maybe i mean maybe it is (99:40 - 99:46)
or is it going to be game tv freak can (99:44 - 99:48)
design the battle system (99:46 - 99:50)
what was it yeah you use this yeah what (99:48 - 99:51)
was it for (99:50 - 99:54)
auris and auras was the competitive game (99:51 - 99:56)
during the time (99:54 - 99:58)
it did go from x and y to auras yeah (99:56 - 100:00)
because because they added new megas (99:58 - 100:02)
the only time they skipped was let's go (100:00 - 100:03)
because and but they but they said when (100:02 - 100:05)
let's go came out and (100:03 - 100:07)
they literally said hey let's go is not (100:05 - 100:08)
a competitive game (100:07 - 100:10)
like they put that flag down very early (100:08 - 100:12)
on with let's go (100:10 - 100:14)
um so i yeah i don't know how they're (100:12 - 100:15)
going to do competitive (100:14 - 100:17)
with this game coming out this fall if (100:15 - 100:19)
they do stick it to sword and shield (100:17 - 100:21)
is sword and shield going to continue to (100:19 - 100:25)
get wild area updates and (100:21 - 100:27)
contests and mewtwo's appearing in raids (100:25 - 100:28)
throughout the time (100:27 - 100:30)
are they going to support both games (100:28 - 100:31)
they could they did with ultrasound (100:30 - 100:32)
ultramoon and let's go (100:31 - 100:35)
ultrasound ultramoon continued to get a (100:32 - 100:39)
new tournaments while let's go existed (100:35 - 100:42)
uh but then that's a long time right (100:39 - 100:42)
because (100:42 - 100:45)
we we got two dlcs last year we have (100:42 - 100:47)
nothing planned for this year for sword (100:45 - 100:47)
and shield (100:47 - 100:51)
this game comes out in fall are we just (100:47 - 100:51)
gonna live (100:51 - 100:54)
sword and shield battle mechanics until (100:51 - 100:56)
generation nine (100:54 - 101:00)
like i don't know um hey i don't know (100:56 - 101:04)
if if diamond and pearl are (101:00 - 101:05)
going to be the main competitive games (101:04 - 101:08)
going forward (101:05 - 101:08)
are their gen8 pokemon post game like (101:08 - 101:13)
faithful remix okay cool (101:11 - 101:16)
get to the end can i import some gen 8 (101:13 - 101:18)
pokemon can i import cramer and can i (101:16 - 101:20)
import stonejoiner can i (101:18 - 101:23)
uh the one thing i feel like i know for (101:20 - 101:25)
sure (101:23 - 101:27)
it's not been confirmed but if a company (101:25 - 101:29)
making this video game (101:27 - 101:32)
also made pokemon home i'm pretty sure (101:29 - 101:34)
those two things are going to work (101:32 - 101:35)
together no (101:34 - 101:39)
no that is that is a step too far (101:35 - 101:41)
you why why would you make that would (101:39 - 101:42)
they do that (101:41 - 101:46)
um that is that is that do it (101:42 - 101:48)
i don't think legends of arceus will (101:46 - 101:50)
have all 890 in 98 pokemon (101:48 - 101:53)
i don't think gen 4 remakes will have (101:50 - 101:56)
all 898 pokemon i think game freak and (101:53 - 101:57)
the pokemon company planted that flag (101:56 - 101:59)
and i think they're standing by it no (101:57 - 102:01)
pokemon game going forward we'll have (101:59 - 102:02)
all 898 pokemon (102:01 - 102:06)
it would boggle my mind if this game (102:02 - 102:06)
doesn't let me (102:06 - 102:10)
import a score bunny or a cramer ant or (102:06 - 102:11)
a (102:10 - 102:13)
a now cremy it would it would actually (102:11 - 102:14)
bog i like i get (102:13 - 102:15)
that you probably have to beat the game (102:14 - 102:17)
beat cynthia and then you can do it just (102:15 - 102:18)
like gen five (102:17 - 102:21)
um but (102:18 - 102:25)
it would feel very weird to not be able (102:21 - 102:26)
to take those freshly (102:25 - 102:28)
new gen8 pokemon and explore a different (102:26 - 102:30)
region with them (102:28 - 102:33)
what if they come out with something (102:30 - 102:37)
that's like pokemon (102:33 - 102:40)
they've used every good word out there (102:37 - 102:45)
like pokemon battle (102:40 - 102:48)
uh competition i don't know and it's (102:45 - 102:48)
like (102:48 - 102:50)
literally it's like links to pokemon (102:48 - 102:52)
home you can oh like a battle revolution (102:50 - 102:55)
yeah that's only about battling and it's (102:52 - 102:56)
like you can move your pokemon (102:55 - 102:58)
in from pokemon home you have to breed (102:56 - 103:00)
them develop them grow them someplace (102:58 - 103:01)
else (103:00 - 103:05)
and it's not tied to an actual adventure (103:01 - 103:06)
that would be cool i mean i could see (103:05 - 103:08)
them doing that because that really (103:06 - 103:09)
frees them up (103:08 - 103:12)
quite the competition part and and the (103:09 - 103:13)
remakes is the part i (103:12 - 103:15)
i i don't know i don't know how you (103:13 - 103:18)
solve for x in that like that is a big (103:15 - 103:21)
that is a big question mark of what (103:18 - 103:26)
how very easily what did these games (103:21 - 103:26)
i could easily see them that this (103:30 - 103:34)
competition stays in sword and shield (103:32 - 103:35)
period (103:34 - 103:38)
and that's that is until the next then (103:35 - 103:38)
their next (103:38 - 103:40)
game that they're going to lease with (103:38 - 103:42)
competition focus another thing (103:40 - 103:43)
if this is faithful remakes does that (103:42 - 103:46)
mean we're not getting (103:43 - 103:46)
synonym forms like when i think (103:46 - 103:52)
of pokemon games going forward i loved (103:50 - 103:56)
alolan forms i love gallerian forms (103:52 - 103:59)
i would like to see a new pokemon yeah i (103:56 - 104:01)
would like to see like a synonym (103:59 - 104:04)
um we got that we got mammoth we got (104:01 - 104:05)
roserade we got (104:04 - 104:08)
all of these extended evolutions you (104:05 - 104:10)
know it's not the same (104:08 - 104:13)
it is the same i want to see uh (104:10 - 104:16)
you know like a cinnonia ninkay uh (104:13 - 104:17)
cinonian (104:16 - 104:21)
um yepper come on like those are (104:17 - 104:22)
fun why would you want to take those (104:21 - 104:25)
away because i don't think they're going (104:22 - 104:25)
to tur (104:25 - 104:27)
i don't think game freak is going to (104:25 - 104:29)
turn over design (104:27 - 104:32)
of new forms and new pokemon to a third (104:29 - 104:34)
party they don't have to creatures helps (104:32 - 104:36)
with pokemon design like they (104:34 - 104:39)
work with items (104:36 - 104:39)
i don't think they're gonna necessarily (104:39 - 104:43)
do that we know that the anime team has (104:41 - 104:45)
made their own pokemon like cosmog which (104:43 - 104:46)
they forced into (104:45 - 104:49)
sun and moon like they can they can have (104:46 - 104:50)
a team of people help (104:49 - 104:55)
make 10 15 sinonian pokemon to make that (104:50 - 104:57)
feel (104:55 - 104:59)
sinnonian is such a bad it's a bad word (104:57 - 105:00)
it's a bad word i don't know what else (104:59 - 105:00)
just (105:00 - 105:03)
give me a better one (105:00 - 105:03)
that is better um but (105:05 - 105:11)
yeah that is something i look forward to (105:08 - 105:13)
in future pokemon games it's (105:11 - 105:14)
something i shouldn't expect though just (105:13 - 105:16)
because they did it for sun and moon and (105:14 - 105:16)
just because (105:16 - 105:18)
they did it for sword and shield doesn't (105:16 - 105:19)
mean every game going forward (105:18 - 105:22)
uh there was a rumor or not a rumor but (105:19 - 105:23)
um (105:22 - 105:27)
uh pokey shopper which is they (105:23 - 105:28)
have all the pokemon merchandise from (105:27 - 105:30)
japan and everything uh they did say (105:28 - 105:31)
that there (105:30 - 105:34)
are uh six new toys coming (105:31 - 105:38)
for shining shining pearl (105:34 - 105:40)
brilliant diamond and one two of those (105:38 - 105:42)
toys are mega lucario and (105:40 - 105:44)
mega charizard so people jump to the (105:42 - 105:46)
assumptions because these are branded as (105:44 - 105:48)
diamond and pro remake toys (105:46 - 105:50)
that mega charizard and mega lucario (105:48 - 105:51)
will (105:50 - 105:54)
possibly be in this game just to prove (105:51 - 105:55)
me wrong (105:54 - 105:58)
fine that's why they did it i don't know (105:55 - 106:00)
why anyone would be shocked about that (105:58 - 106:03)
it's not like when ultrasound ultramoon (106:00 - 106:06)
ended and sword and shield started they (106:03 - 106:07)
forgot about megas (106:06 - 106:10)
like they're adding new megas monthly in (106:07 - 106:11)
pokemon go (106:10 - 106:14)
pokemegas exist in the current episodes (106:11 - 106:16)
of the anime (106:14 - 106:20)
megas exist in pokemon masters (106:16 - 106:21)
i wouldn't be surprised if eventually (106:20 - 106:23)
cafe mix adds pokemon (106:21 - 106:26)
megas as well but why (106:23 - 106:28)
would that surprise anyone to be like (106:26 - 106:30)
megas would come back and (106:28 - 106:32)
everything comes back in pokemon games (106:30 - 106:33)
they (106:32 - 106:35)
they take it away and then they give it (106:33 - 106:36)
they get they give (106:35 - 106:39)
us it back eventually because dynamaxx (106:36 - 106:40)
was such a better (106:39 - 106:43)
interpretation of yeah yeah (106:40 - 106:47)
dynamics i've said this before i think (106:43 - 106:50)
the only the place that megas actually (106:47 - 106:50)
shine in (106:50 - 106:52)
is the anime i think that is the best (106:50 - 106:54)
place for megas (106:52 - 106:56)
but i think for actual competitive (106:54 - 106:59)
battle dynamaxx is better (106:56 - 106:59)
but yeah at the end of the game they (106:59 - 107:02)
could do a sun and moon they could say (107:00 - 107:03)
like at the end of the game (107:02 - 107:05)
here's the mega bracelet here's the mega (107:03 - 107:07)
stones have fun (107:05 - 107:08)
they could say at the end of the game (107:07 - 107:10)
here's one stadium where you can dynamax (107:08 - 107:10)
battle (107:10 - 107:12)
have fun like they can do whatever they (107:10 - 107:15)
want if those things are in there cool (107:12 - 107:20)
if they're not bummer but also like (107:15 - 107:20)
they're getting 60 out of us either way (107:20 - 107:24)
like there this (107:24 - 107:30)
remake i feel like has only opened up (107:27 - 107:32)
more questions (107:30 - 107:35)
than prior to it being announced because (107:32 - 107:36)
of what they showed (107:35 - 107:38)
but it's the pokemon company they're (107:36 - 107:41)
really good at holding out information (107:38 - 107:44)
and then surprising us later um (107:41 - 107:45)
i don't i didn't say this earlier i (107:44 - 107:47)
don't love the art style i like let's go (107:45 - 107:48)
pikachu let's go (107:47 - 107:50)
let's go pikachu let's go eevee's art (107:48 - 107:52)
style better (107:50 - 107:55)
um but i i guess it's like that it's (107:52 - 107:56)
back to (107:55 - 107:57)
yeah i get what they were going to do (107:56 - 108:00)
yeah which (107:57 - 108:03)
about what i what i i what i (108:00 - 108:06)
am happy is that they didn't do like (108:03 - 108:10)
the sword and shield looking scenario (108:06 - 108:13)
for diamond and pearl right and and (108:10 - 108:15)
having that art style (108:13 - 108:19)
because i honestly feel like (108:15 - 108:21)
that this is almost an admission because (108:19 - 108:23)
you know one of my big complaints about (108:21 - 108:25)
even the sun and moons and sword and (108:23 - 108:28)
shield is that the routes are too short (108:25 - 108:31)
and that well they're pretty short and (108:28 - 108:33)
cinno too (108:31 - 108:36)
well no but not not as short (108:33 - 108:38)
just like they're they're more (108:36 - 108:41)
adventuresome and (108:38 - 108:44)
that the the reason is it's a trade-off (108:41 - 108:46)
in being able to include that amount of (108:44 - 108:47)
graphics (108:46 - 108:49)
in it and that you know this allows them (108:47 - 108:50)
to maintain (108:49 - 108:52)
those the same route styles and (108:50 - 108:54)
everything and the whole (108:52 - 108:57)
confusion of mount coronet and getting (108:54 - 108:58)
through that (108:57 - 109:02)
i think that it's (108:58 - 109:04)
so smart from them from a business (109:02 - 109:05)
perspective (109:04 - 109:08)
to have these graphics so (109:05 - 109:11)
dynamically different like no one is (109:08 - 109:13)
confusing diamond report remakes with (109:11 - 109:16)
arceus they're just right so vastly (109:13 - 109:17)
different (109:16 - 109:20)
and i remember times when i was playing (109:17 - 109:21)
ultrasound ultra moon on (109:20 - 109:22)
on my twitch stream people would be like (109:21 - 109:25)
is this x and y is this (109:22 - 109:28)
omega ruby alpha sapphire um and those (109:25 - 109:29)
are like more casual fans (109:28 - 109:31)
that are asking those questions (109:29 - 109:33)
obviously like somebody who's deep into (109:31 - 109:34)
pokemon 2000 hours they're gonna be like (109:33 - 109:36)
this is definitely ultrasound ultramoon (109:34 - 109:37)
because of the health bar (109:36 - 109:40)
but if there's one thing the pokemon (109:37 - 109:41)
company (109:40 - 109:45)
has been very good at is attracting (109:41 - 109:47)
new fans to this series they've been (109:45 - 109:48)
excellent at that this is why (109:47 - 109:50)
sword and shield sold 20 million copies (109:48 - 109:52)
versus x and y only selling 16 and (109:50 - 109:54)
uh sun and moon only selling 15 they're (109:52 - 109:57)
so good at getting new people so like (109:54 - 110:01)
if somebody who is 12 or 15 or 20 or 22 (109:57 - 110:04)
if they saw sword and shield or they saw (110:01 - 110:05)
x and y and they were like (110:04 - 110:07)
those games don't look like they're for (110:05 - 110:09)
me they might (110:07 - 110:11)
look at this and go this looks great oh (110:09 - 110:12)
this is pokemon (110:11 - 110:14)
oh i'm going to try this one and a (110:12 - 110:16)
pokemon fan who goes ugh i hate the (110:14 - 110:17)
graphics (110:16 - 110:19)
but they're still gonna buy it because (110:17 - 110:20)
it's pokemon (110:19 - 110:23)
it's like a win-win for them and i mean (110:20 - 110:24)
it also helps make (110:23 - 110:28)
the game feel very distinct right like (110:24 - 110:31)
it helps set it apart it helps make it (110:28 - 110:32)
visually (110:31 - 110:34)
unique you know you know you're looking (110:32 - 110:37)
at screenshots from diamond and pearl (110:34 - 110:39)
versus screenshots from sword and shield (110:37 - 110:41)
versus screenshots from let's go like (110:39 - 110:43)
they they deliberately change the art (110:41 - 110:45)
style so that the game is (110:43 - 110:47)
easily identifiable yes and they've done (110:45 - 110:48)
this in the anime like (110:47 - 110:51)
i know the second a gen 5 anime is on (110:48 - 110:52)
because they got those (110:51 - 110:54)
thick black beyblade lines and i know (110:52 - 110:56)
when alola is on because it has those (110:54 - 110:57)
thinner more (110:56 - 111:02)
fun more zany lines and then i know (110:57 - 111:03)
when diamond and pearl anime is on (111:02 - 111:05)
because nothing is lined up all the (111:03 - 111:06)
colors are bad and may is (111:05 - 111:07)
halfway through the floor because it's (111:06 - 111:09)
poorly animated like it's (111:07 - 111:13)
very distinct did we cover that as lucas (111:09 - 111:14)
and dawn (111:13 - 111:17)
no we never really said dave it's lucas (111:14 - 111:21)
and dawn (111:17 - 111:24)
[Music] (111:21 - 111:26)
i'm excited for both games but i think (111:24 - 111:27)
i'm more excited for (111:26 - 111:29)
diamond pro just because it's coming out (111:27 - 111:31)
sooner and because (111:29 - 111:34)
i know what to expect i guess i mean i i (111:31 - 111:34)
loved (111:34 - 111:37)
i loved platinum a lot um i really did (111:34 - 111:39)
enjoy diamond and pearl a lot (111:37 - 111:41)
i i think for the first time i'm (111:39 - 111:42)
probably not (111:41 - 111:46)
buying both just because (111:42 - 111:46)
that world of having to trade with (111:47 - 111:50)
yourself doesn't exist (111:49 - 111:52)
yeah there's no proven merit to buying (111:50 - 111:53)
both yeah (111:52 - 111:55)
the so biggest shocker was game freak (111:53 - 111:57)
not working on these second biggest (111:55 - 111:58)
shocker (111:57 - 112:01)
only one version of our kiss yeah this (111:58 - 112:03)
company's really good at selling us the (112:01 - 112:04)
same game twice (112:03 - 112:08)
well but if they're i mean (112:04 - 112:11)
going back to what you've said right no (112:08 - 112:12)
online component (112:11 - 112:14)
what would be the point of having that's (112:12 - 112:18)
very true (112:14 - 112:18)
yeah um it's interesting (112:19 - 112:24)
curious of how they'll do the little (112:23 - 112:26)
watch um (112:24 - 112:28)
that had like 40 different modes there's (112:26 - 112:30)
a lot of things i i don't i don't (112:28 - 112:31)
i think they'll do some things right (112:30 - 112:33)
something's wrong i'm sure something (112:31 - 112:35)
will be annoying something will (112:33 - 112:36)
well hopefully that annoying thing is in (112:35 - 112:38)
hms um (112:36 - 112:41)
i hope mount cornett will not be mount (112:38 - 112:43)
cornett is the worst part of the game (112:41 - 112:47)
um and it's like an important part like (112:43 - 112:48)
right it's (112:47 - 112:49)
it's supposed to be if you've never (112:48 - 112:51)
played diamond and pearl what they did (112:49 - 112:52)
is they put a giant mountain in the (112:51 - 112:53)
middle of the map they called it mount (112:52 - 112:54)
cornet (112:53 - 112:57)
and in order to try verse sinnoh you (112:54 - 112:58)
have to keep (112:57 - 113:00)
cutting through this mountain and as you (112:58 - 113:01)
unlock hms (113:00 - 113:03)
which at the time kind of made sense (113:01 - 113:05)
because it was a way to gatekeep (113:03 - 113:07)
areas of the game yeah you would go (113:05 - 113:08)
through mount cornet and be like (113:07 - 113:10)
now i have strength now i have surf now (113:08 - 113:11)
i have rock climb (113:10 - 113:14)
and so you would always go back to mount (113:11 - 113:14)
cornet (113:14 - 113:17)
but mount cornett was infested with (113:14 - 113:19)
zubats (113:17 - 113:22)
infested with uh slowpokes (113:19 - 113:24)
and uh pro tip they make this item in (113:22 - 113:26)
the game called repel (113:24 - 113:28)
yeah that you could use but it also had (113:26 - 113:29)
that problem of like (113:28 - 113:32)
everyone makes a joke like you needed a (113:29 - 113:33)
b doof on your team (113:32 - 113:35)
because b doof learned four hms but the (113:33 - 113:37)
problem is like if you wanted to get to (113:35 - 113:39)
the pokemon league (113:37 - 113:42)
i'm not joking you needed minimum seven (113:39 - 113:45)
hms you could get you technically needed (113:42 - 113:46)
eight because the eighth one would have (113:45 - 113:48)
been defogged but (113:46 - 113:49)
most of us have pretty okay eyes and (113:48 - 113:51)
defog wasn't as annoying as (113:49 - 113:55)
um flash so you could get by with seven (113:51 - 113:57)
it was like surf waterfall rock slide (113:55 - 113:59)
not rock slide rock climb (113:57 - 114:02)
anyways uh but you needed seven which is (113:59 - 114:03)
like (114:02 - 114:07)
if you didn't want b doof on your team (114:03 - 114:09)
like seven moves dedicated to hm's (114:07 - 114:11)
across six pokemon and that really sucks (114:09 - 114:12)
when you're trying to go to the pokemon (114:11 - 114:14)
league because that's your final team (114:12 - 114:14)
normally (114:14 - 114:17)
it's just well no you change it up right (114:14 - 114:18)
when you get there (114:17 - 114:23)
you have you have your traveling team (114:18 - 114:25)
but even if hms are in i guess that (114:23 - 114:27)
issue is slightly alleviated if you (114:25 - 114:29)
could access your pc everywhere (114:27 - 114:31)
like in let's go and like um sword and (114:29 - 114:32)
shield because then i could just access (114:31 - 114:35)
my pc switch to be do push the rock (114:32 - 114:36)
switch back (114:35 - 114:38)
move on i mean there's a lot of ways (114:36 - 114:39)
that i mean they couldn't (114:38 - 114:42)
have gems they could have hms be (114:39 - 114:44)
like they were in sun and moon where (114:42 - 114:46)
it's tied to a specific pokemon that you (114:44 - 114:47)
call (114:46 - 114:49)
it could be that you access your pc (114:47 - 114:51)
everywhere like there's a lot of ways (114:49 - 114:54)
around it that we just who knows which (114:51 - 114:56)
one they're picking okay yeah (114:54 - 115:00)
yeah okay let's take one more break (114:56 - 115:04)
we have to talk about pokemon snap (115:00 - 115:07)
uh a little bit pokemon go (115:04 - 115:08)
question of the week pokemon of the week (115:07 - 115:10)
and then we are done (115:08 - 115:12)
there's no way you're having question of (115:10 - 115:14)
the week yeah we're gonna skip it (115:12 - 115:16)
it's like let's be real i didn't even (115:14 - 115:17)
think of a song (115:16 - 115:20)
simply because i knew there was no way (115:17 - 115:22)
you were going to allow that to happen (115:20 - 115:26)
okay we will be right back (115:22 - 115:26)
what is a nidoran supposed to be it's a (115:28 - 115:31)
mix of (115:31 - 115:35)
porcupine a rabbit dinosaurs mouse (115:31 - 115:38)
whales jackalope probably a horse and (115:35 - 115:39)
hamster (115:38 - 115:41)
porcupine a rabbit dinosaur is a (115:39 - 115:42)
mountain (115:41 - 115:46)
whales jackalope probably a horse (115:42 - 115:49)
[Music] (115:46 - 115:49)
[Music] (115:55 - 116:12)
we are back all right can we (116:12 - 116:19)
before we talk about pokemon snap no (116:16 - 116:21)
no okay never mind let's not talk about (116:19 - 116:22)
pokemon snappy they're (116:21 - 116:25)
moving on i i think look they they (116:22 - 116:26)
announced two new switch games (116:25 - 116:30)
mm-hmm both both exciting but i just (116:26 - 116:30)
thought (116:30 - 116:32)
there was going to be something more to (116:30 - 116:33)
the 25th anniversary (116:32 - 116:36)
true yeah like they like mentioned (116:33 - 116:38)
masters they mentioned cafe mix they (116:36 - 116:39)
mentioned (116:38 - 116:42)
uh pokemon go no sleep (116:39 - 116:45)
no detective pikachu no movie trailer (116:42 - 116:47)
like the new merchandise isn't even up (116:45 - 116:48)
on the store (116:47 - 116:50)
like it just felt that the 20th (116:48 - 116:52)
anniversary had (116:50 - 116:56)
way more going on think of it this way (116:52 - 116:59)
they're treating this as a full year (116:56 - 117:02)
event so this was the launching point (116:59 - 117:05)
and now we will have a year's worth (117:02 - 117:08)
of fantastic revelations every week (117:05 - 117:09)
something new (117:08 - 117:12)
we can only hope i just uh in comparison (117:09 - 117:13)
to the 20th the 20th just seemed (117:12 - 117:16)
more hype uh did you get your leons and (117:13 - 117:18)
masters (117:16 - 117:21)
no i did that uh (117:18 - 117:23)
yeah i guess i guess we could talk about (117:21 - 117:25)
pokemon masters for a hot minute they (117:23 - 117:25)
added (117:25 - 117:29)
leon to masters i have not (117:25 - 117:32)
gotten my marny it's a one percent poll (117:29 - 117:33)
yep which is the first time they've done (117:32 - 117:35)
a one percent usually a five star new (117:33 - 117:36)
character is a two percent (117:35 - 117:40)
yep um but i think leon is a 12 (117:36 - 117:42)
chance of five star overall whereas (117:40 - 117:44)
usually those banners are ten percent (117:42 - 117:46)
five star so even though leon's a one (117:44 - 117:47)
percent you have a higher chance of (117:46 - 117:49)
getting five stars (117:47 - 117:51)
they're trying to really make leon feel (117:49 - 117:53)
special (117:51 - 117:56)
it's leon he does play special yeah (117:53 - 117:59)
leon's cool it's it's overpowered in the (117:56 - 118:00)
game (117:59 - 118:03)
the hands down they've like just decided (118:00 - 118:05)
that there's no other pair that matters (118:03 - 118:08)
and they gave 6 000 gems this weekend (118:05 - 118:10)
which is extremely extremely generous (118:08 - 118:11)
they gave 3 000 for logging in on (118:10 - 118:13)
pokemon day and then they gave 3000 to (118:11 - 118:15)
celebrate the 1.5 year anniversary of (118:13 - 118:17)
pokemon masters and they (118:15 - 118:19)
say that they have two year plans so i (118:17 - 118:21)
guess pokemon masters outlives pokemon (118:19 - 118:23)
duel in that regards of (118:21 - 118:27)
lasting two years they mention cafe mix (118:23 - 118:28)
on stream (118:27 - 118:31)
so hey cafe mix is going strong i guess (118:28 - 118:32)
you're getting all those second golden (118:31 - 118:34)
acorns or whatever it was (118:32 - 118:38)

of the (120:48 - 120:52)
new thing they showed (120:49 - 120:52)
it looks like they have at least the (120:52 - 120:57)
screenshot they have trending photos (120:54 - 120:59)
they have featured course and then they (120:57 - 121:01)
have recommended (120:59 - 121:03)
so who knows if this will be a complete (121:01 - 121:05)
disaster or (121:03 - 121:09)
why would it be a disaster i don't know (121:05 - 121:11)
anytime you can give people a stylist (121:09 - 121:12)
and they can draw on their photos (121:11 - 121:14)
something can go wrong (121:12 - 121:16)
wait who said that you could you can't (121:14 - 121:17)
draw you can do stickers (121:16 - 121:20)
i mean you can put your stickers in a (121:17 - 121:21)
very interesting arrangement but (121:20 - 121:26)
yes it's limited in some way (121:21 - 121:26)
yeah i mean i think a lot of people are (121:27 - 121:30)
still worried that this game isn't worth (121:29 - 121:32)
60 dollars worth of (121:30 - 121:36)
game yes i will say hot take this is the (121:32 - 121:37)
first (121:36 - 121:41)
pokemon professor to ever (121:37 - 121:46)
this is my dude oh really yeah (121:41 - 121:46)
i'm dating this guy okay i'm making my (121:46 - 121:50)
trip to the lent all region (121:49 - 121:53)
[Laughter] (121:50 - 121:58)
uh yeah i still i mean (121:53 - 122:01)
there was nothing more that they showed (121:58 - 122:01)
that (122:01 - 122:05)
made me think okay i'm really i'm bored (122:01 - 122:06)
now like all the things that they showed (122:05 - 122:08)
are things that i expected them to (122:06 - 122:09)
already included you can throw the (122:08 - 122:12)
luminous orb at the pokemon and it (122:09 - 122:13)
changes the color (122:12 - 122:16)
changes the color to fire (122:13 - 122:20)
like that's not very exciting (122:16 - 122:22)
uh here's the thing i'm not going to see (122:20 - 122:24)
how cute that vaporeon was when you (122:22 - 122:26)
threw it and i ate the apple and then it (122:24 - 122:28)
gets into a little smiley pose for you (122:26 - 122:28)
what (122:28 - 122:30)
what is wrong with you why do you hate (122:28 - 122:31)
goodness (122:30 - 122:35)
i don't i here's the thing my (122:31 - 122:37)
whole probably first interaction with (122:35 - 122:38)
this game will be watching one of you (122:37 - 122:39)
play it (122:38 - 122:41)
because that's really interesting to me (122:39 - 122:43)
and i don't know that i'm going to get (122:41 - 122:45)
more enjoyment out of me playing the (122:43 - 122:48)
game then say watching what if you play (122:45 - 122:49)
the game on the big screen (122:48 - 122:51)
but you can get a shiny calibey i'm (122:49 - 122:52)
pretty sure (122:51 - 122:55)
no yes oh no i don't think the celebrity (122:52 - 122:57)
was shot that was shiny (122:55 - 122:59)
um it also says wild pokemon thrive on (122:57 - 123:00)
the island of lentil region where (122:59 - 123:02)
environments can greatly differ making (123:00 - 123:04)
for a variety of habit (123:02 - 123:06)
habitats where different pokemon (123:04 - 123:07)
expressions and behaviors can be (123:06 - 123:07)
observed (123:07 - 123:09)
observed players will be able to get (123:07 - 123:11)
their attention by playing a melody (123:09 - 123:12)
which was in the original game (123:11 - 123:16)
yeah who gets all real happy (123:12 - 123:16)
throwing fluff fruit they will also be (123:17 - 123:20)
able to use (123:20 - 123:24)
illumina orbs an invention of professor (123:20 - 123:24)
mir (123:24 - 123:27)
on pokemon to witness something out of (123:24 - 123:28)
the ordinary (123:27 - 123:31)
i'm assuming that's in i'm assuming that (123:28 - 123:32)
means pester ball (123:31 - 123:34)
yeah they didn't want to use pester ball (123:32 - 123:36)
because pester ball is kind of mean (123:34 - 123:39)
yeah lights up the pokemon yeah i think (123:36 - 123:40)
it's just like (123:39 - 123:41)
insta no pastor ball where you're going (123:40 - 123:43)
to use this orb and they're going to do (123:41 - 123:44)
something cute instead of being like (123:43 - 123:46)
frustrated that you threw a smoke ball (123:44 - 123:47)
at their head (123:46 - 123:51)
um those charmanders got real mad when (123:47 - 123:52)
you threw pesky balls and apples out (123:51 - 123:53)
their heads (123:52 - 123:55)
and magikarps confirmed in the game i (123:53 - 123:57)
saw that they can even use their camera (123:55 - 123:59)
to run scans which will be helpful to (123:57 - 124:01)
find hidden pokemon or inspect their (123:59 - 124:02)
surroundings (124:01 - 124:04)
as a player keeps researching a course (124:02 - 124:06)
their research level will increase they (124:04 - 124:08)
may discover pokemon acting in different (124:06 - 124:08)
ways (124:08 - 124:11)
which is like the replayability trainers (124:08 - 124:13)
may even encounter legendary or mythical (124:11 - 124:13)
pokemon (124:13 - 124:15)
we know in the first pokemon snap there (124:13 - 124:17)
was moltres zapdos articuno (124:15 - 124:20)
um there was mew i don't think there was (124:17 - 124:21)
me too (124:20 - 124:23)
there's like mewtwo in the stars but i (124:21 - 124:24)
don't think mewtwo yeah yeah me too in (124:23 - 124:25)
this (124:24 - 124:28)
there was a shadow or it was in the star (124:25 - 124:31)
wars like the constellation yeah (124:28 - 124:31)
i i yeah i guess we'll see i mean like (124:33 - 124:37)
pokemon snap could be an (124:36 - 124:39)
awful game and they will sell millions (124:37 - 124:41)
of copies because nostalgia (124:39 - 124:44)
yeah well and plus like little kids will (124:41 - 124:46)
get a lot out of it (124:44 - 124:48)
yeah right just like the on rails (124:46 - 124:50)
component which is the detractor for me (124:48 - 124:52)
is perfectly fine for them i mean i'm (124:50 - 124:54)
not saying it's (124:52 - 124:57)
where's my switch come on man it's just (124:54 - 124:59)
it's just i don't think it's a game for (124:57 - 125:02)
me yet yeah i need to see it i need to (124:59 - 125:03)
see (125:02 - 125:07)
the replayability of it you know a lot (125:03 - 125:09)
of things are catching (125:07 - 125:10)
there's a lot of games like i still (125:09 - 125:12)
haven't completed a lot of things in (125:10 - 125:14)
sword and shield so (125:12 - 125:17)
like we'll see um i you know (125:14 - 125:19)
i i'm very interested in watching it i'm (125:17 - 125:21)
very interested in seeing how (125:19 - 125:25)
it goes and how people play the game and (125:21 - 125:27)
and watching people play and take (125:25 - 125:29)
pictures may encourage me to buy it i (125:27 - 125:31)
enjoyed the first game (125:29 - 125:36)
um i'm just not yet sold on this one (125:31 - 125:36)
although the closest they've come to (125:36 - 125:40)
selling me on this (125:39 - 125:43)
is in the edit and share on the web page (125:40 - 125:44)
the mustache (125:43 - 125:49)
on the two canon is very very good (125:44 - 125:52)
it's very good the (125:49 - 125:52)
next set of news here um oh i guess (125:54 - 125:57)
we'll talk about some pokemon go (125:56 - 125:59)
uh we did the canto tour we didn't talk (125:57 - 126:00)
about that last week because we recorded (125:59 - 126:01)
early (126:00 - 126:06)
um good news is none of us got covered (126:01 - 126:08)
well i'm still in 14 day quarantine i'm (126:06 - 126:09)
not seeing anybody (126:08 - 126:13)
hmm yeah um (126:09 - 126:15)
well i got tested i'm good so if you're (126:13 - 126:17)
around me (126:15 - 126:20)
and i was you were you're definitely (126:17 - 126:21)
around me (126:20 - 126:24)
um so we went to mall of america (126:21 - 126:27)
we played the kanto tour as (126:24 - 126:31)
somebody who went to uh all four pokemon (126:27 - 126:32)
go fests (126:31 - 126:34)
i think the kanto tour was better than (126:32 - 126:37)
all those go fest (126:34 - 126:37)
i think the things that you did (126:38 - 126:42)
um and the hour rotation change (126:43 - 126:48)
i thought was engaging and fun so i have (126:48 - 126:54)
i (126:52 - 126:54)
i what i had wished is that (126:56 - 127:01)
the first it started with everything in (126:59 - 127:03)
the wild and it ended with everything in (127:01 - 127:03)
the wild (127:03 - 127:06)
and the rotation was just in the middle (127:03 - 127:07)
because having played the whole day (127:06 - 127:09)
waiting for the rotation to come back (127:07 - 127:10)
around again (127:09 - 127:14)
was was very (127:10 - 127:14)
it was kind of frustrating it was it was (127:14 - 127:17)
super frustrating but it was like oh (127:16 - 127:20)
steve needs a jinx and that is not (127:17 - 127:23)
coming up again for another three hours (127:20 - 127:25)
yeah i knew we were going to be playing (127:23 - 127:27)
i know but (127:25 - 127:29)
from sort of a time thing i think it (127:27 - 127:30)
would have been more (127:29 - 127:33)
exciting for me to have everything (127:30 - 127:34)
spawning (127:33 - 127:35)
just there was a ton of stuff in the (127:34 - 127:37)
first couple of hours then they went to (127:35 - 127:39)
the regimented time and then they (127:37 - 127:41)
ended with everything in the wild for a (127:39 - 127:43)
couple of hours (127:41 - 127:45)
that's just me like that's the complaint (127:43 - 127:47)
i sent to them like i wish it had been (127:45 - 127:50)
open segmented open i did have a good (127:47 - 127:51)
time but i (127:50 - 127:54)
can't say that i had a better time (127:51 - 127:57)
with this one than i did at go fest um (127:54 - 127:59)
because (127:57 - 127:59)
stuff didn't have raids yeah i mean the (127:59 - 128:03)
raids were fun (128:01 - 128:05)
to a point we know when we were chasing (128:03 - 128:07)
the 400th wow (128:05 - 128:09)
time (128:07 - 128:09)
hotel room hanging out and other folks (128:10 - 128:14)
were out still doing raids (128:13 - 128:17)
you guys you guys went so it was a (128:14 - 128:18)
12-hour event (128:17 - 128:20)
it was from nine to nine which i think (128:18 - 128:22)
is way too long (128:20 - 128:24)
it was very long and it was very wait (128:22 - 128:25)
wait wait wait we didn't give the most (128:24 - 128:27)
important update on this whole event (128:25 - 128:30)
okay i won will anderson (128:27 - 128:34)
won because i finished everything (128:30 - 128:37)
everything (128:34 - 128:37)
i thought the collection things were (128:39 - 128:43)
cute i am not mad that things were in (128:40 - 128:44)
raids (128:43 - 128:47)
uh again because we were in a location (128:44 - 128:47)
yeah (128:47 - 128:50)
where we could do a lot of raids i (128:47 - 128:52)
understand why people may have been (128:50 - 128:52)
upset (128:52 - 128:55)
for people who didn't go to a location (128:52 - 128:55)
it was (128:55 - 128:58)
a risky choice in a risky time so i get (128:55 - 129:00)
that complaint we (128:58 - 129:02)
made a different choice we took a lot of (129:00 - 129:04)
precautions to be able to make that (129:02 - 129:04)
choice (129:04 - 129:07)
so the raids were never a barrier to us (129:04 - 129:10)
um there were a lot of raids uh halfway (129:07 - 129:11)
through the day (129:10 - 129:13)
i was really sick of running into the (129:11 - 129:15)
trainers at stops and having to say (129:13 - 129:18)
no i do not want to battle you anymore (129:15 - 129:19)
which is the complaint for people who (129:18 - 129:21)
played at home they didn't see those (129:19 - 129:21)
trains and (129:21 - 129:23)
people who didn't see them i thought (129:21 - 129:26)
that was handled really (129:23 - 129:28)
weird that was like that's a part that i (129:26 - 129:29)
was like (129:28 - 129:32)
you need to tweak that a lot more uh the (129:29 - 129:34)
thing that i saw that i do agree with is (129:32 - 129:37)
like put the trainers in a balloon have (129:34 - 129:38)
the balloon come down (129:37 - 129:40)
instead of saying team rocket it says go (129:38 - 129:42)
fest uh that would help the (129:40 - 129:46)
people at home that would have (129:42 - 129:48)
a trainer standing on top of a pokemon (129:46 - 129:49)
is still super frustrating and that's (129:48 - 129:51)
what happened at the last (129:49 - 129:54)
yep um go fest uh (129:51 - 129:56)
which was like over the summer you could (129:54 - 129:57)
just play anywhere but there was still (129:56 - 129:59)
team rocket people just standing on top (129:57 - 130:01)
of pokemon that you want to tap on look (129:59 - 130:02)
i don't want to battle you right now i (130:01 - 130:03)
just want to tap on this (130:02 - 130:05)
cloister right you guys got to play like (130:03 - 130:08)
me and use your pokeball plus to put (130:05 - 130:10)
a majority of it i wasn't tapping on (130:08 - 130:11)
anything (130:10 - 130:14)
i didn't i didn't want to fill up my sp (130:11 - 130:15)
fill up my (130:14 - 130:18)
space um i thought the amount of shinies (130:15 - 130:19)
we got were good (130:18 - 130:23)
uh it the (130:19 - 130:26)
like i felt like maybe i expected (130:23 - 130:28)
the shinies to happen more in the wild (130:26 - 130:29)
than they did like (130:28 - 130:31)
i got more off of my incense than i did (130:29 - 130:33)
in the wild just (130:31 - 130:35)
running into them and that felt a little (130:33 - 130:36)
off (130:35 - 130:40)
um that being said i showed up at nine (130:36 - 130:41)
in the morning and i left at nine at (130:40 - 130:43)
night so and i had (130:41 - 130:45)
an amazingly great time i just can't (130:43 - 130:47)
attribute all of that to the event (130:45 - 130:49)
like yeah no some of it was that (130:47 - 130:51)
delicious pizza oh that was so good (130:49 - 130:52)
pizza was good (130:51 - 130:56)
um so i (130:52 - 130:59)
i think what they what i think overall (130:56 - 131:00)
it was worth the 12 bucks (130:59 - 131:04)
and we ran we ran a poll on our (131:00 - 131:06)
twitter we had like 900 people (131:04 - 131:08)
participate in it obviously those are (131:06 - 131:09)
people who listen to the show or who (131:08 - 131:11)
follow the twitter for news so they're (131:09 - 131:12)
obviously pokemon fans (131:11 - 131:15)
um but i think it was like 52 percent (131:12 - 131:18)
said it was worth it 48 said it was not (131:15 - 131:20)
i was in the investing i was in the nut (131:18 - 131:22)
and i would also i would probably assume (131:20 - 131:23)
that a lot of people that said it was (131:22 - 131:24)
not were (131:23 - 131:26)
people who played at home i would be (131:24 - 131:28)
very (131:26 - 131:31)
very curious but in a sense where we (131:28 - 131:32)
went to (131:31 - 131:35)
probably what i still think one of the (131:32 - 131:37)
best places in the united states to play (131:35 - 131:41)
wall of america uh they had eight gyms (131:37 - 131:44)
25 poke stops yeah i think (131:41 - 131:48)
it was jim (131:44 - 131:51)
any raid tauros bell sprout there was no (131:48 - 131:52)
bell spot raids but if there was a (131:51 - 131:53)
bellsprout (131:52 - 131:56)
uh filled up instantly yeah didn't have (131:53 - 131:57)
to talk to anyone (131:56 - 132:00)
didn't have to do anything if greg got (131:57 - 132:01)
into a 20 raid (132:00 - 132:02)
will would get into his own 20 raid i (132:01 - 132:04)
would get in my own 20 raid it would (132:02 - 132:05)
just (132:04 - 132:07)
fill up it didn't it looked when we (132:05 - 132:09)
started it was not that way early in the (132:07 - 132:10)
morning (132:09 - 132:12)
like yeah i was a little worried when we (132:10 - 132:13)
first started like (132:12 - 132:15)
when you got because will and greg they (132:13 - 132:16)
kind of tapped out around (132:15 - 132:20)
7 30ish and then me and chris continued (132:16 - 132:23)
grinding will and i had a wonderful time (132:20 - 132:25)
enjoying each other's company (132:23 - 132:27)
watching a weird chateau thing that was (132:25 - 132:28)
love (132:27 - 132:32)
horrible hgtv (132:28 - 132:32)
and neither of us cared enough to change (132:32 - 132:35)
the channel but after (132:34 - 132:38)
after like after like 7 30 in the mall (132:35 - 132:40)
of america it was it was (132:38 - 132:42)
it was still easy to get like seven (132:40 - 132:43)
eight people in your raid but it was no (132:42 - 132:45)
longer filling up like i think (132:43 - 132:48)
i think overall at least in that area (132:45 - 132:51)
people were done after 10 hours i mean (132:48 - 132:52)
it was a long (132:51 - 132:55)
day it was and i mean right for me i i (132:52 - 132:58)
don't want our listeners to think that (132:55 - 133:00)
will anderson gave up no that is 100 (132:58 - 133:01)
incorrect (133:00 - 133:05)
i literally had completed (133:01 - 133:07)
not only like the professor willow (133:05 - 133:09)
research but what is the like the today (133:07 - 133:11)
research is that just called special (133:09 - 133:12)
research or whatever (133:11 - 133:14)
special today research yeah i had (133:12 - 133:16)
completed all of that which means like i (133:14 - 133:18)
evolved every pokemon (133:16 - 133:21)
from kanto that could evolve uh yeah the (133:18 - 133:23)
only reason (133:21 - 133:26)
for me to be out with my very very tired (133:23 - 133:29)
legs continuing to walk the mall of (133:26 - 133:30)
america (133:29 - 133:32)
would be to try to get a shiny mewtwo (133:30 - 133:34)
and guess what chris didn't get a shiny (133:32 - 133:35)
mewtwo (133:34 - 133:37)
guess what steve didn't get a shot in (133:35 - 133:38)
youtube so (133:37 - 133:41)
i i i i'll get i'll show you some other (133:38 - 133:42)
day (133:41 - 133:45)
20 20 premium raid passes for a year and (133:42 - 133:49)
a half i finally was able to spend them (133:45 - 133:49)
i mean when you when you started the (133:50 - 133:53)
kanto tour they gave you like what three (133:51 - 133:55)
four or five incense or something like (133:53 - 133:56)
that (133:55 - 134:00)
they gave you three (133:56 - 134:03)
uh remote raid passes they gave you ten (134:00 - 134:06)
or maybe nine uh (134:03 - 134:09)
daily free raid passes you could do so (134:06 - 134:09)
if (134:09 - 134:11)
in rate passes alone they gave you more (134:09 - 134:13)
than 12 worth again if you were at home (134:11 - 134:15)
you probably didn't take advantage of (134:13 - 134:17)
those um so i totally get it (134:15 - 134:20)
but in a situation where um you were out (134:17 - 134:21)
and about (134:20 - 134:23)
and you were doing raids and you were (134:21 - 134:24)
joining raids (134:23 - 134:27)
um you got your value there i think (134:24 - 134:28)
there was (134:27 - 134:29)
points they gave star pieces during some (134:28 - 134:31)
of the research as well and they gave (134:29 - 134:33)
you the shiny ditto and they gave you (134:31 - 134:34)
the rare encounters of the (134:33 - 134:37)
the snorlaxes and the lapras and the (134:34 - 134:40)
shiny odds were increased um (134:37 - 134:43)
i think it was like niantic has (134:40 - 134:44)
definitely (134:43 - 134:47)
gotten better at these events over time (134:44 - 134:48)
every event they have (134:47 - 134:51)
definitely definitely minus maybe the mr (134:48 - 134:52)
mime event (134:51 - 134:54)
but these big events that probably take (134:52 - 134:56)
a lot of planning a lot of setup (134:54 - 134:58)
um they have really knocked it out of (134:56 - 135:00)
the park i don't think though (134:58 - 135:02)
i i still think if niatik had the choice (135:00 - 135:04)
to do (135:02 - 135:06)
an irl go fest they would still do it (135:04 - 135:08)
they would do they would do this make so (135:06 - 135:09)
much more money (135:08 - 135:12)
yeah um um oh yeah let me throw that in (135:09 - 135:13)
as well (135:12 - 135:15)
not only did i win by getting all the (135:13 - 135:17)
research is complete before everybody (135:15 - 135:17)
else (135:17 - 135:19)
i completed like three other researches (135:17 - 135:20)
that i had not (135:19 - 135:24)
you yeah (135:20 - 135:24)
i was busy yeah you got a lot you had a (135:29 - 135:33)
you got a lot accomplished that day (135:32 - 135:35)
i completed everything that i wanted to (135:33 - 135:37)
do i was more than happy at the end of (135:35 - 135:39)
the day to go sit down (135:37 - 135:44)
having not walked in literally a year (135:39 - 135:44)
walking walking was uh (135:44 - 135:50)
interesting uh seeing the levi stuff (135:47 - 135:53)
in person was yeah so i don't know i (135:50 - 135:53)
think (135:53 - 135:56)
yeah look a lot better in person than (135:53 - 135:57)
they did (135:56 - 135:59)
on the website and the classic american (135:57 - 136:01)
thing we either have extra small or (135:59 - 136:02)
extra large (136:01 - 136:04)
that wasn't even extra large because i (136:02 - 136:05)
would have bought an extra large it was (136:04 - 136:07)
extra extra large is what they had left (136:05 - 136:10)
yeah i will say the negative for the day (136:07 - 136:11)
or at least one of the negatives for the (136:10 - 136:12)
day (136:11 - 136:16)
was i'm not going to name names but all (136:12 - 136:16)
you (136:16 - 136:20)
folks with your jank (136:16 - 136:22)
boy it's hard to control my language now (136:20 - 136:23)
your jank (136:22 - 136:26)
remote raids that you persisted (136:23 - 136:31)
in inviting us to over and over (136:26 - 136:34)
i appreciated it liar (136:31 - 136:36)
i think i i think i did too many raids (136:34 - 136:37)
though the problem (136:36 - 136:39)
the problem when you're in a raid is (136:37 - 136:41)
because the the problem when you're in a (136:39 - 136:42)
raid is you can't (136:41 - 136:45)
catch you can't spin i mean you can poke (136:42 - 136:47)
ball plus catch but (136:45 - 136:49)
um i spent a lot of time in raids (136:47 - 136:50)
because what would happen is somebody (136:49 - 136:52)
would invite me to a raid and i would be (136:50 - 136:53)
like uh (136:52 - 136:54)
like i haven't done a raid with them (136:53 - 136:56)
today maybe they need my help okay can (136:54 - 136:57)
we talk about something (136:56 - 137:01)
yes mmm (136:57 - 137:04)
pokemon go players frustrate me so much (137:01 - 137:08)
how can you go through the entire day (137:04 - 137:10)
the entire go fest and not bring a mega (137:08 - 137:11)
pokemon (137:10 - 137:14)
just mega evolve anything i didn't (137:11 - 137:16)
realize that i could (137:14 - 137:18)
evolve that's another research i (137:16 - 137:19)
finished that day i didn't know i (137:18 - 137:21)
couldn't because (137:19 - 137:24)
none of us none of us benefited from (137:21 - 137:26)
your mega hound doom (137:24 - 137:29)
once no never mind (137:26 - 137:29)
here's the cost benefit analysis (137:36 - 137:44)
the two seconds of the time we saved in (137:40 - 137:45)
the raid (137:44 - 137:48)
was off put by the five hours (137:45 - 137:50)
of steve going bringing them back and (137:48 - 137:58)
how do you oh yeah i'm so cool (137:50 - 137:58)
that malibu guy had like a gloom and a (138:01 - 138:06)
butterfree and i don't know what else he (138:04 - 138:08)
had but mega houndoom swept that dude so (138:06 - 138:09)
many times (138:08 - 138:11)
i only battled that dude i don't know (138:09 - 138:13)
who the dude in the pikachu outfit was (138:11 - 138:15)
or the girl in the explorer hat or the (138:13 - 138:16)
dude with the 3d glasses (138:15 - 138:19)
give me malibu because mega houndoom (138:16 - 138:21)
sweeping the floor with that guy (138:19 - 138:23)
i swept with al all the other traders (138:21 - 138:25)
with a lot of other things and what did (138:23 - 138:27)
you not hear from me the entire day (138:25 - 138:30)
mega ho doom when (138:27 - 138:32)
when my mega hound doom ran out i should (138:30 - 138:34)
have did mega gyarados though (138:32 - 138:37)
oh boy where are we sweeping with mega (138:34 - 138:39)
gyarados when i pulled that bad boy out (138:37 - 138:42)
but the point being is all these people (138:39 - 138:43)
at mall of america (138:42 - 138:45)
doing raid after raid after raid you (138:43 - 138:46)
know they're not at home (138:45 - 138:48)
easy to invite people i invited five (138:46 - 138:50)
people every time i joined in a raid and (138:48 - 138:52)
most of those people never got in (138:50 - 138:53)
because there was just so many people at (138:52 - 138:54)
mall of america (138:53 - 138:57)
that were just jumping in and it was (138:54 - 139:00)
like i saw so many people at level 41 42 (138:57 - 139:01)
43 44 (139:00 - 139:03)
these people over level 40 none of them (139:01 - 139:05)
using megas (139:03 - 139:07)
now there wasn't a mega that was perfect (139:05 - 139:08)
for every single (139:07 - 139:10)
encounter but in my s in my situation i (139:08 - 139:11)
was like well (139:10 - 139:13)
i want mewtwo i'll do as many mewtwo's (139:11 - 139:14)
as possible i'll pick a dark (139:13 - 139:16)
mega and you don't have a lot of options (139:14 - 139:17)
you got gyarados you got hound doom (139:16 - 139:19)
but you could have done like mega (139:17 - 139:21)
ampheros if you wanted to do (139:19 - 139:23)
like zapdos or not zapdos but articuno (139:21 - 139:24)
moltres (139:23 - 139:27)
um mega bee drills not good against (139:24 - 139:28)
you can do mega beat drill against me (139:27 - 139:31)
too yeah bug against me too but (139:28 - 139:34)
in the very few situations where i was (139:31 - 139:35)
mega (139:34 - 139:36)
and there was like maybe two or other (139:35 - 139:38)
three people mega (139:36 - 139:40)
there was a significant difference of (139:38 - 139:41)
like clearing up (139:40 - 139:45)
30 seconds faster or 20 seconds faster (139:41 - 139:47)
and that was just more time getting mad (139:45 - 139:48)
at the trainer standing on top of (139:47 - 139:49)
pokemon that you can (139:48 - 139:52)
like like because we did so many raids (139:49 - 139:54)
back to back (139:52 - 139:56)
that time to me eventually added up and (139:54 - 139:58)
also like i don't know how you're level (139:56 - 139:59)
44 and (139:58 - 140:00)
not think like just pop on a mega you're (139:59 - 140:02)
gonna get mega candy in return you're (140:00 - 140:03)
going to help out the other people it's (140:02 - 140:06)
going to be slightly easier like (140:03 - 140:09)
what what what possible other reason (140:06 - 140:10)
would you be (140:09 - 140:13)
not meg like this is the time to make (140:10 - 140:16)
if any other time existed playing for 12 (140:13 - 140:17)
hours (140:16 - 140:20)
is the best time to mega because (140:17 - 140:22)
of the gameplay we're doing like i (140:20 - 140:24)
understand not megan today if you're (140:22 - 140:26)
only maybe going to do one or two raids (140:24 - 140:26)
but (140:26 - 140:29)
in a like i don't know it just kind of (140:26 - 140:31)
felt weird to me that (140:29 - 140:33)
no one really megan anything like i (140:31 - 140:35)
would look through the roster and it's (140:33 - 140:36)
like oh no one having met (140:35 - 140:38)
this one person who is way too into (140:36 - 140:40)
megas i will never make a (140:38 - 140:42)
because i don't want to be that person (140:40 - 140:43)
every day on my twitch stream people (140:42 - 140:45)
coming in i wish they would bring megas (140:43 - 140:47)
to sword and shield y'all ain't even (140:45 - 140:48)
using them in pokemon no (140:47 - 140:51)
bring them i want to see them you (140:48 - 140:53)
couldn't see anything (140:51 - 140:56)
geez i never even pay attention to the (140:53 - 140:59)
other things that are out on the (140:56 - 140:59)
i wish i could get some boba tea man the (141:03 - 141:07)
line at the boba team plays so long tap (141:04 - 141:09)
tap tap tap tap tap mega hound (141:07 - 141:11)
finally got his servants due this (141:09 - 141:12)
weekend for years (141:11 - 141:15)
in x and y and omega ruby no one thought (141:12 - 141:16)
mega houndoom i put (141:15 - 141:19)

about it (141:19 - 141:23)
none stop (141:20 - 141:23)
i'm all about the mega okay uh there is (141:24 - 141:27)
a (141:27 - 141:30)
the the season is changing in pokemon go (141:27 - 141:32)
they introduced seasons three months ago (141:30 - 141:34)
it was like the season of celebration (141:32 - 141:36)
um this is the pokemon rotation like (141:34 - 141:38)
some pokemon will never spawn when a (141:36 - 141:40)
season existed um (141:38 - 141:42)
they're gonna be rotating it come march (141:40 - 141:44)
first probably today listening to the (141:42 - 141:44)
podcast (141:44 - 141:47)
so the first season season one of (141:44 - 141:48)
pokemon go is called season of (141:47 - 141:49)
celebration (141:48 - 141:51)
this is technically the second season (141:49 - 141:53)
it's called season of legends (141:51 - 141:56)
um landorus thunderous tornadoes coming (141:53 - 141:58)
back their therian forms are coming (141:56 - 142:01)
um new mega pokemon will be coming (141:58 - 142:03)
different pokemon will be in the wild (142:01 - 142:04)
for the northern hemisphere in the (142:03 - 142:06)
southern hemisphere (142:04 - 142:08)
um different pokemon will be in eggs uh (142:06 - 142:10)
there will be (142:08 - 142:13)
season exclusive research (142:10 - 142:15)
and there will be other bonuses going (142:13 - 142:16)
forward we're not going to go through (142:15 - 142:17)
the whole thing this podcast is already (142:16 - 142:18)
way too long (142:17 - 142:20)
but we can talk more in depth we'll (142:18 - 142:21)
probably actually have more information (142:20 - 142:23)
about the season after march 1st (142:21 - 142:28)
that we can talk about and that's uh (142:23 - 142:31)
i think that's it leon marnie some (142:28 - 142:34)
those came to masters i think cafe mix (142:31 - 142:35)
had um (142:34 - 142:38)
a couple like celebi return and stuff (142:35 - 142:40)
like that (142:38 - 142:43)
there was supposed to be pokemon 25 (142:40 - 142:46)
merch it went up on the store last (142:43 - 142:46)
monday (142:46 - 142:48)
there was no pictures then it got pulled (142:46 - 142:50)
from the store it's still not (142:48 - 142:52)
up they put a 400 train on the store (142:50 - 142:54)
they put a master ball in the store (142:52 - 142:55)
master ball sold out i think the master (142:54 - 142:58)
ball was 120 dollars it was limited to 5 (142:55 - 142:59)
000 people (142:58 - 143:01)
that's gone train is still up there if (142:59 - 143:02)
you want a 400 (143:01 - 143:05)
pokemon train but the actual 25 (143:02 - 143:07)
anniversary merch never went up although (143:05 - 143:09)
i would expect it probably goes up later (143:07 - 143:10)
this week (143:09 - 143:13)
i am confident throughout this two and a (143:10 - 143:15)
half hour long podcast (143:13 - 143:18)
we have missed something but the nice (143:15 - 143:19)
thing about this podcast is it comes out (143:18 - 143:23)
every single week so true we will get to (143:19 - 143:24)
whatever we missed next week (143:23 - 143:26)
we get more information about diamond (143:24 - 143:28)
and pearl or (143:26 - 143:31)
legends we can talk about that if you (143:28 - 143:33)
have your own opinions of that stuff (143:31 - 143:36)
you can let us know on twitter discord (143:33 - 143:38)
uh youtube comments (143:36 - 143:40)
podcast comments those don't exist i (143:38 - 143:42)
lied but (143:40 - 143:45)
uh will give us our pokemon of the week (143:42 - 143:47)
last week's pokemon of the week (143:45 - 143:50)
uh uh it's a mythical from alola it's (143:47 - 143:52)
not zara aura it was in a movie (143:50 - 143:54)
takes no damage from normal or fighting (143:52 - 143:57)
type moves and i used to be scared of (143:54 - 143:59)
the creature it was based on when i was (143:57 - 144:00)
camping as a cub (143:59 - 144:03)
scout (144:00 - 144:03)
it's chat (144:04 - 144:11)
never chat why would chat chat (144:07 - 144:13)
pokemon chat takes damage from normal (144:11 - 144:14)
and fighting type (144:13 - 144:18)
moves it's marshadow (144:14 - 144:21)
it is marshmallow yes (144:18 - 144:23)
[Music] (144:21 - 144:27)
i just typed marshmallow into google (144:23 - 144:30)
marshall (144:27 - 144:30)
what do you got anything good no (144:30 - 144:34)
probably not uh (144:32 - 144:36)
that's not a lot no the pokemon is the (144:34 - 144:39)
same type combination as marshadow (144:36 - 144:41)
yeah marshado is the only pokemon who's (144:39 - 144:44)
stab combination is unresisted by (144:41 - 144:46)
any existing pokemon the only type (144:44 - 144:48)
combination to resist both ghosts and (144:46 - 144:49)
fighting is currently (144:48 - 144:51)
unused normal ghost oh there's not a (144:49 - 144:54)
normal ghost pokemon crazy (144:51 - 144:55)
well because they yeah it's like you (144:54 - 144:57)
can't be normal and a ghost (144:55 - 144:59)
you gotta pick not with that attitude (144:57 - 145:02)
marshadow is the last pokemon in alola (144:59 - 145:04)
and the pokemon sun and moon pokedex (145:02 - 145:06)
that's really bad trivia come on (145:04 - 145:06)
um (145:06 - 145:09)
[Laughter] (145:06 - 145:12)
marshadow's effort value yields two (145:09 - 145:14)
attack and one speed which is unique (145:12 - 145:16)
yeah because you're knocking out (145:14 - 145:17)
multiple mar shadows over there just (145:16 - 145:19)
like why would you (145:17 - 145:22)
the shuffle icon is very good shelf icon (145:19 - 145:23)
is good (145:22 - 145:28)
shiny shiny is bad (145:23 - 145:28)
no it's it it the shiny has never been (145:28 - 145:32)
released but the shiny is (145:30 - 145:34)
bad because it looks identical until it (145:32 - 145:36)
does that thing where it's cape comes (145:34 - 145:38)
out (145:36 - 145:40)
and then the cape is different it's like (145:38 - 145:42)
instead of green it's like purple (145:40 - 145:44)
oh so you can't tell it's shiny and tell (145:42 - 145:45)
it to keep (145:44 - 145:47)
you know when it goes into like when it (145:45 - 145:50)
uses its signature move have i ever used (145:47 - 145:53)
marsh shadow in everything (145:50 - 145:53)
um (146:01 - 146:04)
[Music] (146:02 - 146:07)
yeah uh martial's all right what about i (146:04 - 146:09)
love my shadow i think marshado's my (146:07 - 146:10)
favorite myth ago (146:09 - 146:13)
wow wow (146:10 - 146:17)
it's so cute all right this pokemon i've (146:13 - 146:19)
probably done this one before (146:17 - 146:23)
but it's been a tough week (146:19 - 146:27)
another all but forgotten pokemon (146:23 - 146:29)
an alolan pokemon that has only ever (146:27 - 146:30)
appeared (146:29 - 146:34)
in alola it chills the warm waters of (146:30 - 146:35)
the sunny islands (146:34 - 146:39)
but it is not a water type the pokemon (146:35 - 146:40)
it evolves from (146:39 - 146:44)
is also not water type one of its types (146:40 - 146:47)
is weak to the other so that it only (146:44 - 146:48)
resists (146:47 - 146:51)
bug ice and it's dark types a dark (146:48 - 146:53)
type attacks i'm sorry gotta read this (146:51 - 146:55)
more clearly (146:53 - 146:58)
this pokemon is never found (146:55 - 147:02)
in the wild you can only obtain (146:58 - 147:05)
this pokemon if you evolve another (147:02 - 147:06)
pokemon (147:05 - 147:10)
at mount laniki lanakila which is pretty (147:06 - 147:13)
far from the water who was the first (147:10 - 147:17)
person to ever obtain this pokemon (147:13 - 147:19)
there you go that should be enough okay (147:17 - 147:20)
you're never going to get it because (147:19 - 147:22)
it's like the most forgotten pokemon (147:20 - 147:25)
ever i'm sure (147:22 - 147:27)
