[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 481st episode of the pokemon podcast it's super effective i'm your host sbj uh with me is will i am very angry greg you didn't warn me that i have reached the point in my life where a friend of mine contacted me at 8 30 last night and said hey come over and let's watch harry potter and i said it's 8 30 at night why would i leave my house it's his answer why is this my fault i've been telling you this for a while you're ahead of me by two years and i will go sometimes i will occasionally leave my house at 9 00 pm not often i went but i was like but you were tired and you regretted don't you dirty it's so late i'm already in the house exactly there are things out there people out there that are nefarious i literally showed up at his place and i was like you know what there was a time in my life where if i was at the club at 11 i was there too early because nothing good happens until midnight look we all know that all the things that happen at midnight are no longer for us now speak for yourself sir happy hi i'm here i got nothing i got water look will came at me early for a thing that i've mentioned a lot i have talked about growing older look you make plans at 8 30. those plans can happen after midnight but it has to be well planned before 8 30 or i'm not leaving steve's like we're gonna hang out and watch twitch i'm like when 2 am i'm dead to you at that point you're like come over to my place it's 3 a.m and i got nothing to do and i am laying between two dogs next to my husband blissfully not aware of your needs we'll have the g fuel fridge we'll just slam some g fuel you know gold i do not consume caffeine after 11 a.m and not do that anymore we cannot consume caffeine that late okay we got a lot to cover this uh episode yes why yes there's no pokemon go stuff yeah swine came out and everybody hates it it takes two hours of pokemon masters there was one of my masters there was trailer there was a new diamond pro trailer true true true and we all know that if they show us 45 seconds of footage we can talk about that for 45 minutes true see we got stuff to talk about but we gotta start off with the controversial thing the controversy the issue the thing that'll get greg out of his chair is it the size or issue no that we're saving that for the i thought that that's the only controversy i've seen uh so getting into news here this is off m msn.com what wow what what are you doing to me it's like you reached in the trash pin past aol.com to get to msn.com look i just wanted to read msn.com there was there was plenty of articles that all said the same thing this is off msn.com alolan ninetales new pokemon unite hollow wear skin costs 40 dollars the pokemon unite launched a new sacred style halloween for our lola ninetales yesterday it is the most expensive item they've released so far in the zirco trading shop it lists the new cosmetic item as 2499 eos gems which translates roughly to 40 the official pokemon unite twitter account posted in celebration of the skins launch yesterday which promoted fans to push back with the criticism of the halloween pricing playing with it to a lower cost the united team has not responded uh if then they then msn goes on to explain what hollower is [Laughter] barring bonus gems one may receive as part of the pokemon unites first time purchase promotion the most cost effective way of scrounging up enough gems for the nine tails skin is to pay 39.99 for a total of 2 740 eos gems even if you only wish to spend 2499. and uh yeah i mean that's the article explains the unite for the msn reader who might not know what unite is but we don't have to read that stuff uh so yeah uh whoo here it's a skin it's so ridiculous how much they priced this for it is unbelievable i was like so excited that nine tails was finally getting a uh outfit nighttails is your second most played right yeah second second i was played and it is i'm done i'm done i'm like no you're not no it's not no wait for that 80 dollar mamo swine skin to come out no because mammoth wine isn't even good yeah yet yeah and a lot of people like oh look it finally got we're so excited that we also have the price tag and we're like for what i mean it does come with vulpix too are there any others what that are that expensive no the most expensive thing up to this point was the cramer ant outfit uh which was why do the skins have different costs like everything everything has really weird costs like there's something that's like a hundred and one uh yeah i don't like it but tickets and it's like why is it just not a hundred tickets the cramer ant skin was um it was 1760 eos gems which if you're just looking at the uh first time buying eos gems that would be twenty dollars but that is it's giving you one thousand two hundred twenty plus one thousand two hundred twenty so it's i think that crime rate skins closer to twenty five dollars the credit cr sorry the trainer outfit but based off kramer yeah and you can't change your hair color nope just like in the gengar astronaut con thing you can't change your hair color there either it's stuck purple the gengar space outfit is cute and part of the battle pass and the battle pass wasn't even 40 this is somewhat cute it's the only option for nine tails and it's 40 bucks for what it doesn't even fly it doesn't even give you a boost it doesn't even like change the ice into something it doesn't make butterflies come out nothing i believe it does have like animation forty dollars okay so there are different i'm not getting trainer outfits with it no those are separate oh my word i don't know how much those are okay there are different types of i'm i'm not defending it i'm just explaining the different types of skins that exist because they do they are different types of skin so um the cinder ace the talon flame pilot the talonflame pilot and then the gengar are all this the same as this nine tails which means that when you select the skin in the menu there's like a animation that happens there's like a little trailer if you pick the cinderease he like like looks through his eyeglass and he swings on the boat and then he like kicks a ball um and for those four skins the nine tails the cinderease the gengar and the talonflame all evolutions have uh outfits versus the garchomp outfit which he's like the detective outfit the gibbel and the gab i don't have anything it's just the guard chop dang same with the blastoise blastoise has this bad vest on squirtle war twirl doesn't have anything so these for these four um i wish i wish they just named them like like apex it's like um legendary rare common uncommon they don't really name them anything if you if you can buy them they are not rare or uncommon correct if you can purchase them by that matter but and they're digital they don't have a rarity they are more fully fleshed out they are animated they cover the entire line except the whole point of is to not stay as vulpix at three minutes into the hand saying that was rare it was legendary is there any nothing are there any like loot boxes for that include skins and stuff that this might yeah fall out of i mean it could go into one of the battle passes later it could go into a loop no i'm just saying right now are there is there any loot mechanism that this could so yeah that's artificial rarity i mean i don't think they're saying i'm not they're not saying it's rare they're saying it's legendary no no well legendary doesn't mean rare i'd say if you just okay this is wrong okay but okay we shouldn't get in the semantics of rare or not rare some of us collect the pokemon trading card game where some of the rarest cards are worth like two dollars and some of the not rarest cards are worth like 20 just because of that's playability card games yes yeah that's all trading card games i mean trading card games the rarity is based off of how many they technically is a dinner rip-off it's like it's you could you could get two dinners at raising canes for forty dollars and i have if okay so if you've put two months into this game and haven't spent any money and nine tails is your favorite i could see somebody being like well i'm gonna continue playing nine tails for another four months because forty dollars is close to the price of a full game that's a lot yeah yes who has been playing this game for that long without putting any money into it i you know that's a good question i i i i haven't touched unite in like two weeks well no that's not true i installed it on my ipad and said wait it doesn't work with my xbox controller i'm out so here's here's the question i want to pose because i spent i bought the most expensive thing on day one which was the cramer ant outfit yeah and now it's just ripped apart and fall into tatters so cheaply made how do you feel about that purchase would you spend 40 on your favorite pokemon snorlax no well let's just say your favorite pokemon was in the game no i i just happened my favorite pokemon i just had this conversation at my with my hairdresser yesterday that world of warcraft killed my cosmetic purchase desire because when that game went south i realized how much money i put into digital nothing nothing that nobody but me cared about and i when i walk away from a bad game when the bag when the game goes south i've just literally gave them money for nothing like the closing the closest thing for me is in in vanguard there's like there's always like an extra rarity for pretty much every card and a lot of vanguard players will max rarity their deck and they're like literally spending five hundred dollars for a deck that if you do regular rarity costs about eighty-five and you know what for the four to eight hours a week that i get to play vanguard the cards do exactly the same thing yeah yeah they work the same if i happen to pull a secret parallel card um you know what fun i'll put it in my deck it's sparkly it's really hard for me to read with my bifocal contacts but still uh but otherwise no it doesn't do anything except you could have given that money to charity there's lots of things in the world that don't do anything i got a hundred dollar metal pokeball it doesn't do anything yeah you should be giving that money to charity there's hungry people out there even even even if it was my favorite pokemon a 40 dollar price tag would absolutely stop me 40 100 i can't come i cannot come up with 15 for a mountain final fantasy 14 a game i have been playing now there are mounts that are 40 right in final fantasy like the whale is the whale is 40. right and i'm not i i'm not no even that i can't even do the cheap ones because i can't it does i it doesn't matter it does not make me happier it does not make me think i'm enjoying this character more because it's dressed differently and it doesn't it makes me feel even worse because i spent way too much money on it in comparison to everything else in that game and there's no reason for it to be this expensive none par part of the problem too though i think greg which which may be skewing us i mean i've got to take that that perspective somewhat is that in 1984 40 would have bought me three optimus primes like the big good transformers not the little ones in the tiny packaging but the big ones that came in the box yeah that were made out of metal nuke 40 is real money yeah it's if it was 10 i'd be like oh okay maybe yeah i really like nine tails it's only 10 bucks there you go sure that's a price point for content that does nothing 20 is like [Music] 40 is a heck no you've got to be kidding me see i i have an alolan vulpix right there i'm familiar with that also as a gift look if somebody gifted me 40 no not all the conversations okay that's on them for making poor life choices so i have been playing apex legends for two years and the thing about apex legends is their best skins are twenty dollars for a character and they don't really do that much compared to anything else right like there are there's your your level four is your best one your 20 skin then you have your level three which is usually like ten dollars then you have your level two and no one's buying level two and level ones because those are just no you just never equip them they're just garbage they're just nothing um and the gun skins like a gun that you might not even pick up in the match because you're it's a battle royale you drop in you pick up what you have you could be dead before then a gun skin for a gun that you can only see the front part of is also 20 in that game and and it has been 20 for legendary characters or legendary guns since day one and people have complained every single day on the apex subreddit sometimes you get enough of these people to log in at the same time and it makes it to the top of the page of wow these things are too expensive and it's been over two years and respawn has not changed their pricing in fact they've doubled down on some of that stuff where originally a loot box in apex legends is is a dollar and they do these celebration loot boxes which are seven dollars um and they still give you three polls uh and there are what are called heirlooms in that game and during these celebration events if you collect all the celebration items you can get the heirloom and the heirloom lets you cash in for all an heirloom is is a character holding an item so instead of running with no gun they run with like a a wrench or they run with like a knife to like signify you know they got the heirloom so let's say they released an heirloom for bangalore they did this let's say your favorite character is bangalore the in order to get the bangalore heirloom you either have to get it out of a loot box or if you complete the celebration event you can then cash in to get bangalore's item that was i'm not exaggerating it's about 200 to complete the celebration event because the loot boxes are seven dollars you gotta open the loot boxes make sure you don't get doubles and then you did it you completed the celebration event you spent 200 bucks now you have the bangalore heirloom so to me i'm not defending the 40 in pokemon unite i am saying that i am sure there are other games out there besides apex legends that are worse but apex legends is very bad it's been around for two years they haven't changed their pricing i don't see the complaints of nine tails getting changed i think this is kind of the way it is and it sucks yeah um but i already know people who bought it like i do too the difference is is that united is new and apex is old and the people who have been playing apex are it's just like they're used to it by now but for unite since it's new it's like we are shocked i mean i would tell i would look at the apex thing be like no yeah i mean but i've been playing apex for two years and my favorite character crypto he doesn't have an heirloom yet and they will probably do a celebration event for crypto and crypto so it's like i have i have put in two years of apex legends i have put fifty dollars in uh besides battle oh geez besides battle passes i bought the battle pass every three months so the battle pass every three months is what like 10 bucks um but for like loot boxes slash celebration events um i think i've only put 50 bucks in only uh and you when i put the 50 bucks in i i didn't feel good there was nothing out of the 50 where i was like yup this was worth it all right so to all of our economists that are listening to this program alert alert late stage capitalism we're here you are looking for the signs the signs have appeared people are throwing here for a while money at nothing i met a guy at twitchcon uh this is because i i had a hustle to that twitch party and greg was doing d d stuff but for some reason we were talking about apex legends and uh the guy the guy i was standing next to he said he has purchased every single skin in apex legends up to that point and i want to remind you that skins are 20 for characters and guns and most guns and skins have like five plus different variations where do you get this money so proud i just he was very he was very proud that he owned everything but i haven't had that mentality over medical bills and some dudes spending five thousand dollars on you you can't say you had that mentality with destiny because with destiny it wasn't pay you didn't but but destiny it was in destiny 1. there were those stupid things oh my god in destiny 1 they had they introduced because destiny 1 was like four years long i think three or four years long and then after like two years they introduced emotes and like emotes were anywhere between like what three bucks to like 15 bucks but it was pretty there was there wasn't that many 15 bucks ones and i wanted to have all of them because they were so they were cheap enough where they would do like maybe um you know 10 new emotes every couple months and you'd get a couple for free right they rude drop randomly or whatever or you did some event and you would get one that i would be like well it's only like twenty dollars to get the last four i'm missing and so i got all the emotes in destiny i had every single dance emote destiny was my most played game and destiny had the promise of this was going to be a 10-year game and destiny 2 was coming and the huge thing was oh nothing transferred from destiny 1 to destiny 2. you had to start all over and that turned me off and i i think that's what turned me off from like apex and destiny 2 of buying cosmetics you know i've bought and i've purchased maybe four cosmetics in destiny 2. um whether i think most of them were like on discount because they'll have like sales but the argument is like well if these skins weren't 20 in apex if they were 10 i'd be more likely to buy it but why is that an argument now you wait for what but clearly by their price point but clearly respawn if they weren't making money at twenty dollars of skin they would have changed it they're clearly do it's been two years it's working whatever they're doing is working so i think the other part of the problem too greg is when you and i were growing up we were like when i turn 18 i'm getting out of this house and i'm gonna go live in my own life on my own and folks today are like i'm 40 years old and living in my parents basement and that's just fine because i've got all these skins i have all the apex skins but this this applies to things outside like will said with cards like i i was the tcg player that i had all hollow energies i had all hollow trainers i look at the room you're in you're a fool i know money should never go to you good call valid i'm just saying if there's a forty dollar crime rat skin i'd probably buy it we know cause you are a sucker but i i i haven't even bought all the characters any night i have i haven't either i have zero desire to play talonflame i have zero desire to play snorlax i don't care about playing pikachu five year old yeah five years three five well yeah okay i was just using an example five years ago i probably would have been that person that was like well i need to unlock all the characters because i need to have them all unlocked but like but in the reality i'm never going to play little guys so they could sit there yeah right like i don't even have i i was such in a completionist mindset however many years ago that i i felt that i needed to own everything and i think it was mostly destiny one that knocked me out of that i mean world of warcraft killed that for me because i bought every collector's edition i bought all of the things and like why why did they give them this money why so i could get a statue that is literally clogging in my house that i'm like i need to get rid of this it is so meaningless to me at this point it is such a temporary fix for all of the other problems that i'm ignoring retail therapy is a bad thing i am a very big retail therapy person like there's a new dungeon dragon's book out that had i got for free i got the digital version for free and i'm still thinking do i want the alt cover so it can literally sit back there and i will never look at the alt cover never it will sit i don't even have the covers out it's all the spines yeah i i have i've i've given up this collector's lifestyle because it hurts but also there's all sorts of stuff in boxes in my house and i'm like why there's night goes away i i lose it for 40 dollars yeah for my second character not a good argument but i would rather them have 40 skins that they're making money off of than to have the pay to win that they have right now oh yeah if if this was 40 and were killing all the pay to win items that would have been one thing but they didn't they added three new items they gave you things like a hair but also here's three new items that fyi nobody knows how to use yet but they probably made them real good so uh guess what now you have to level these because it's completely changed the field also here's a 40 skin also here's a new character blastoise super powerful here's mama's wine garbage but sylvia will probably be scary also sylveon comes out this week sylvian comes out this week like i i i hate that this is the pricing structure of these free-to-play games but the reality is we live in a world where games are free to play and they're seasonal and like every game has a battle pass and i completely forgot that until we brought up apex that i have purchased every battle pass to apex and that is eight seasons ten dollars each or eight dollars each however much of battle passes in apex and these companies are releasing different things because eventually even if you say no no i'm not doing this they will hook you with something um or most people i mean they run the risk they it it is it is not without its if you're never going to buy a 40 nine tail skin but they release 10 more 40 skins i can't is that going to just suddenly push you away you've already said no to the first one there are some people yeah i mean that there is there is a limit there is a greed limit that people hit and continual hits on the greed button will turn people away from your game like the more they are bare face about money you do drive a segment of the people away who are like if it was once or twice but this is how you want to run your game i do not want to support you it is a risk bring your spookiest pokemon to the spooky cup competition this is off pokemon.com uh just in time for halloween pokemon sword and shield in-game competition in which only the spookiest pokemon can't participate the aptly named spooky cup has trainers partaking in a double battle with the scariest pokemon partners as an added twist only the final evolution forms of the pokemon can battle for example you can have crowbat on your team but no zubat or goldbat i think they literally only reason this rule exists is so people can't use dust clops yeah dusklaps is significantly better than dusknoir trainers who participate in at least one battle regardless of whether they win or lose will earn 50 battle points assemble your best team for the challenge there's no spooky ball guy shirt no spooky ball guy do

eclipse tcg expansion which wasn't exactly lined up but pretty close and then when let's go came out we got another shiny legend thing i don't remember which one that was though it was so memorable

stuff uh so we will be right back [Music] hey uh what do you guys think about pumpkin spice skin spices pumpkin spice pumpkin [Music] pumpkin spice pumpkin spices [Music] frosted flakes pumpkin spices we got the peppermint mocha and we are back from our break okay before we get to the diamond pearl stuff i didn't think we had to talk about this on the show oh dear so we don't but when when non-pokemon people in my family are messaging me articles about this uh oh we have to talk about it my mom didn't ask me about it this is awesome nobody's asked me about it this is off food and wine.com oh wow we're just hitting all the top sites why yeah mom used to subscribe to that magazine too pokemon oreos are listed on ebay for thousands of dollars look we have covered this do not buy sketchy cookies from ebay no need to go further it is a false it's false it's fake don't do it just let it go do not order any food items from each other no growth also do not buy medications yeah don't buy the cases on people don't buy cookies off of ebay just buy them at your store you chewable vitamins no no buy them and do what i did eat them you just eat it it tastes just like every other pokemon oreo uh so uh somewhat of a very clickbaity title here i'm gonna skip most of the article uh where they they they uh they talk about doritos and cheetos selling for quite a bit of money then they talk about how oreo just launched this cookie with pokemon they talk about how they're 16 pokemon cookies and then we get to the actual meat and potatoes of the article uh and which is the last paragraph here it says a search for a pokemon mew oreo on ebay reveals that cookies have been posted on the site for as high as 25 000 though anyone can put up something on sale for ebay the tricky part is actually selling it but a quick peek into sold listings reveal that the 25 000 is an outlandish price and cookies do uh the cookies do appear to be getting snatched up at a premium uh even one has been listed to sold for fifteen thousand one hundred dollars although i'm a bit skeptical the author of this article that that particular one was on the up and up plenty of other cookies sell for about one dollar to ten dollars which seems more accurate price of their representation um and that's pretty much the article so okay quick i am on ebay right now there is a super deal pokemon mew oreo rare plus the ancient mew card current bid is 99 cents you have six states at the time of this record next day is there to buy it now set no no it's gonna be a bidding war because everybody knows that ancient mew plus the oreo is the key to unlocking mewtwo in the real world it's like that yeah look mike promranz writer of food and wine i understand i don't agree with but i understand you had to write a convincing enough title for somebody click your article i get it i feel free he didn't write it mike had to write the bulk of the thing and they gave it to somebody else it's like here's the thing give us a punchy headline how do we get somebody wrote that punchy headlight but i do have just was given an assignment by the editor saying look pokemon's hot right now oreos did a thing come up with an angle you have three hours go pokemon's hot right now but i will give mike credit because he clearly understood ebay and understood the like people people this this is the problem with um this is the problem the actual issue is people just read a headline and then they assume that like wow these cookies are selling for ten thousand dollars uh when at least in this article it does actually say that no these cookies are selling between one and ten dollars well i'll say this again we've set this on the show just because something sold on ebay for a price doesn't actually mean that somebody bought it right like there is there was one time in my twitch stream where somebody said you can't bid on ebay because if you don't pay they'll sue you no that's not how ebay works there is no obligation for you to pay anything the the worst thing that can happen is ebay bans your account there's like no the the ebay police are not kicking down your door because you spent 50 on an ancient mew on ebay and you didn't pay the person you bought it from there is no ebay pulley fyi there's no ebay police you could you could spend ten thousand dollars on a cookie and not pay just because you're like this was funny like what no so you're not spending ten thousand dollars you could get the winning ten thousand dollar bid and then just not finalize the transaction correct and you'll get like a bad star on ebay and then they'll ban your account and then 30 days later you can make a new account and it's fine it's it's all fine it's like the the amount of people that don't understand how ebay like i can just tell that somebody's never bought anything on ebay because they have these outlandish things uh it's like the people that are like well i don't i can't buy uh an original jungle booster pack on ebay what if it's a scam yeah the dude with 40 000 items sold on ebay is gonna no his entire livelihood is built on this website the last thing he wants to do is get his ebay account flagged like there's so much dedication to somebody who has thousands of transactions on ebay like they are they are in it for the long haul the thing that that kills me actually i don't know if you saw this are the uh the card scams on amazon oh yeah where you buy sealed product from amazon and it's basically somebody bought it yeah opened it took all the good cards yeah and then did it as a return to amazon so amazon's like oh it's a return they didn't use it so we can just sell it yeah yeah that's the that's the real skill that's scary to me that can't exist on ebay but that's not going to exist on ebay from like a verified 20 000 exactly right yeah yeah on amazon it's the wild oh it's the wild west over there amazon amazon don't care they're not those things employees are not getting paid enough to check to see if something they're all they're all working for two dollars while they're watching their super chief fly into space what do they care about their product or their customers so even that though an oreo sold for fifteen thousand one hundred dollars i agree with what was his name mike mike there's no proof that that actually went through like why would one person pay 15 000 when you can see hundreds of well not hundreds but maybe like 20 30 40 50 completed auctions of a cookie selling for like six bucks didn't even come with an ancient mew it didn't come with an hmi so why would you pay that kind of money anyways to all my family and friends who don't listen to this program stop sending me these articles about cookies selling for ten thousand dollars that's not true see this is why nobody in my family does this to me because they they they aren't running for the blistering response they're like yeah i'm sure he knows about it um off pokemon.com encounter alola regions roll it litten popplio and max ray battles this is really cool it's over it's over zero heads up like always it's infuriating uh this was the first time you would be able to catch raw lit litten and popplio in anything other than a pokeball um because there was no way to catch them before possibly shiny and with hidden abilities but there was no increase shiny for this no i think it's possible anything i thought they could be shiny they also since i spent literally a weekend trying to get the hidden abilities and luxury balls i now have a set of all three in luxury you need the ability you already have a hidden ability just put that one in the thing with the luxury ball and then breed it down because i needed something to do this weekend oh buddy i had stuff we could have been doing look i had stuff i was like friday night i was out at magic it was a great time but my body said guess what you just had surgery and you are staying home on saturday because you're wrecked and what did i do with my time i hunted the lowland starters and raidens hey it was a cool event it was very short no heads up a little frustrating on that end um again i'll say this every time it's one of the things niantic does better than game freak is at least they give us like two weeks heads up for these events at least we we knew we knew about disco community a month ago like you can plan take off move some stuff around uh it's just kick events should be on like let me know about this event i would like to plan for your event i would like to set some time up to participate in your video game not everyone can just drop everything and go catch a million possible you get for having a life how dare um okay so there were two new trailers that were dropped one for brilliant diamond shining pearl one for legends of arceus uh oddly enough these seemed like they could have both been included in the nintendo direct and true did not because they were not any they're not really that exciting of trailers um speak for yourself i was very excited the legends arcus stuff looks fantastic okay well let's start there uh so they showed off a couple things here let's see i'll just we'll just go through the press release uh the pokemon alleges arceus brings players to the vast history region this this is the central region as it existed in the past long before familiar towns and cityscapes of diamond and pearl were established rich in nature and with mount cornet towering at its heart this is cinno um unlike anything players have ever experienced before and they will embark on a journey to complete the region's first pokedex um and so uh the first bullet point here is your arc phone will be your guide this is where we got this is where i went off the rails i've been off the rails ever since this was this was put out they're very advanced okay okay what time in the past are we if we have a cell phone i will admit as a person who works in the cell phone industry cell phones existed long before people thought they did but that was still 1946 not 18 something as they suggest this series is set in unless unless this series is in 1940 and the pokemon games of modern are like the year three thousand and then the future i can answer this hoopa opened a ring threw the cell phone through the ring if you wrote a story and said hoopa did it you would be raked over the cold also if we don't even if we've never been in this town before where the cell who built the cell towers to make your phone work who put in the infrastructure where there's no satellites how is your phone working all right i got an answer from the rotom phone had wrote tom in it does the arceus phone have arceus in it i have an answer for this you don't you have you made up satellites and then hoopa opened the ring and they pushed the satellite to the ring is this is this a team galactic plot they're like let's pollute the past with technology early on your adventure what year is it players will get a device called the arc phone it's distinctive appearance might lead one to suspect it somehow has a connection to the mythical pokemon arceus this device seems to have some certain sort of strange power and will help players uh on their journey okay i'll say it as a strange part it's connecting a stealth service that doesn't exist it's got a rotom in it it doesn't it's an arceus phone special pokemon with mysterious powers during their expeditions players may run into pokemon that are larger than normal and have glowing red eyes these are known as alpha pokemon they are stronger than their regular counterparts and they will be quite aggressive in chasing down and attacking players that stray too close there are also special pokemon in the his region that have received some sort of mysterious blessing some of these pokemon are particularly powerful and have been come to known as nobles while others said they are willing to assist the people in the region each of these pokemons seem to hold the power not held by regular pokemon people known as wardens are tasked with looking after these pokemon by performing duties such as uh making sure noble's territories remain unviolated or providing offerings of food and water these pokemon nobles are re revered by by the people in the region but some strange phenomenon is now causing them to suddenly fly into a frenzy uh the causes for the incidents is still shrouded in mystery once frenzied these pokemon are incredibly incredibly difficult to reign in which forces the people of the hisui region to turn to the galaxy expedition team for help as part of the survey corpse you will be called upon to quell the frenzy of nobles um monster hunter pokemon cross over to me so then they introduced cleaver the axe pokemon bug rock type special minerals found in the jesui region caused scyther to evolve into this pokemon there you go that at least makes sense greg uh part of its body have been hardened to stone the stone also gets chipped during fierce battle and cleaver that uh and cleaver that have survived many battles will display large chips across their body it is said that the people in the hisooy region use pieces of stone to craft tools so we have some answers there yeah apparently one of the pieces done is to make a cell tower is it cleep is it cleaver or clever i'm not sure they don't say it out loud yeah they haven't said it out loud it it it looks like it looks like clever because of the o because it's not an e yeah but i don't know the way you say scissor is scissor like a pair of scissors but some people say size or but it's supposed to be like a pair of so i don't know i'm we'll wait until the anime i guess okay so uh let's back up here um so we have two different things we have uh noble pokemon and then we have alpha pokemon so we've seen alpha pokemon there was like an uh alpha ursa ring and an alpha luxury i think in the original trailer uh i know some people maybe speculated that it could be like shadow pokemon because their eyes were red or something uh and then the noble pokemon kind of seemed like boss battles i guess kind of yeah i mean it's such replacing trials right yeah yeah it seems like to like the gym trial system of go here cleaver seems like the first one maybe this it seems like the first one because the only thing i really learned from this trailer is oshawa doesn't evolve until 17 yeah because the oshawa was 16 in the trailer and the cleaver was 18 and i was like wait why isn't the sasha what involved yet and i was like oh maybe they chose not to evolve it because it's really cute duat is at 17 will but you could you hit b he was only at 16 though he wasn't there yet oh he wasn't the thing can we as a society stop using alpha since that that came from the alpha wolf thing and it turns out that that science paper was complete garbage no i mean alpha is just the first letter of the greek alphabet yeah it's the first it's the first squad to die and then beta squad has to come in it's super angry and they're super protective that's not what alpha is just the first letter it's the first one the whole alpha wolf thing is garbage a lot of people just use it to mean like the top top what about the alpha lion because they they use it for gorillas and everything too they just like any kind of a pack yeah and the wolf thing was wrong yeah but it's become common parlance now so yeah but it shouldn't be excise it from society okay so open up koopa go back in time get rid of the alpha it's steampunk it's okay um how do we feel about cleaver he's okay i i i like split evolution i'm glad they didn't completely yeah um i actually really kind of like the design it's very futile looking which i i i kind of like like even though we're apparently in the 1980s when cell phones were plentiful uh i i do think it's a very cool design i think it fits the scyther line like i think it it doesn't look like you know when to what goes to sam rotten you're like what uh i think this i think is a really good cool looking design i'm not overly thrilled about the bug rock type but whatever well because since seizor is bugged steel and they don't have steel that's why it has to be rock i'm sure they have steel they made a phone that's made with precious metals not a steel it also seems like this is you know your first or second boss battle i again i don't know if i like the word boss battle but that's what it seems like it is and then first right like if it means it has like a it has like a a health like a four-part health bar above it yeah um it seems very much like maybe it's moves or something changes when it gets to the halfway or one third of the way this is i mean this is a very common video game trope they have different levels of like they do their move set changes halfway through otherwise it would be a very boring battle or whatever and at some point you have to throw a pouch of something at it because they really made sure to zoom in on that pouch yeah that popped in the air so maybe this is the answer to there's no gyms but there will be these nobles and you gotta do the nobles i'm sure i may i would wager to guess there would be optional nobles um that you don't have to do my some might be harder than others why why would there be optional ones it's like a very like final fantasy slash yeah jrpg where there's like there's a couple that are stranded somewhere that are completely optional i would say like the alpha pokemon or the optionals but the nobles you have to do yeah that could be yeah um okay so getting out of the second part race uh across sprawling untamed landscapes with riding pokemon during their adventures players will re receive the celeste celestial celestical flute i don't know how to say that word uh this mysterious instrument that has been passed down from generation to generation of hisoui people play the flute anywhere to so many special pokemon that lets you ride them riding these pokemon will allow people allow players to move faster on land uh or across body of waters or soar through the skies weird deer has powerful sturdy legs riding while riding upon will allow players to gallop through the land at great speed and jump over obstacles basket legion will allow players to be on its back traveling across body of waters also able to launch himself out of the water letting players leap effortlessly over obstacles and hissuian bravery lets players fly through the sky from the from up in the air players will also get a good look at the lands and what pokemon live down below and what items can be found um so i think the only takeaway through this was that the trainer character threw a pokeball off of the basketball legion and was correct that just wrecked that octopus right in the face uh i'm gonna guess you could probably do that off weird deer in bravery too because i didn't show it i would imagine yes and then the last car flying one yeah maybe the last part is uh players can prepare their for survey work at juba life village there's a cl there's a hairdresser and a clothier clothier and hairdresser players can mix up outfits and hairstyles at the clothier or the hairdresser to choose their looks that was really cool the photography studio players can take pictures alongside their pokemon at the photography studio hoopa must have threw a camera and a cell phone through at the same time look it's just wild it's just that they don't even care the general store and crafts uh if players used up their items on a previous excursion they can replenish their supplies at a general store they can also use in-game currency to buy new crafting recipes and materials from the craftwork and then the pastures the pastures craft ones the pastures are where players can leave pokemon that they have been caught many pokemon that will need to be caught for the pokedex but only six pokemon can be taken along in the party players can choose which are the right pokemon for each mission before heading out on surveys uh at any of the various pokemon camps players can change which pokemon they have in their party or send the pokemon to the pastures i think the passengers is just your pc right yeah you couldn't figure out pc technology but they got a cell phone in a uh photo studio and also the wardens are clearly descendants or ancestors of various people in the future yeah so one of them uh the beyblade kid big beyblade energy kid he has a place he has clay's hat lian has clay's hat mai has marley's hair marley oh the the one with the arcanine yeah pokemon masters marley yeah talk about masters barley the only game she's really known for because you get a million of her uh our zoo are a zoo has mars's hair yeah this i i don't really know who is can looks like they're pretty the pokemon company game freak whoever is in charge of this stuff they're pretty good at like leaving out a lot of stuff well you've got to interpret the signs yeah look at the patterns um i'm gonna say it again these graphics are bad the thing that throws it off for me is is the screenshot of the munchlax with the can uh with the marley hair and how her tights just look so awful like the munchlax looks pretty good the sky looks great the ground texture still looks bad the trees still look bad that's fine but man like her tights like are they're just so pixelated and like static like it's like they applied the the jpeg the jpeg but they should have implied like uh that's a properly scaling png yeah it's like they just messed up the file format her like her hair her face looks great like if you look at her her head and her hair and the lighting on her hair that all looks great and then the more you go down her body and you get to her like legs and like the bottom of her dress you're like what happened there why does that look so bad i don't know i'm being very all right male gaze maybe stop going down her body yeah just look her in the eyes like you should and stay there because the rest of it isn't for you steve my mistake cleaver looks good cleaver looks great the outfits look cool that you can dress up in yeah the outfits look really really great i'm very happy with the character customization customization yeah there's a buddhu rosalia outfit already and i'm into it that's all i'm gonna wear okay the beyblade energy kid uh he's standing in front of a great a giant tree yep that looks great very happy with the screenshot tree looks good he looks good shadows look great the trees behind that looks great this game is so finished yeah not finished who would have guessed yeah but then you okay so you go from beyblade energy in front of the tree and then you go to the screenshot where the bravery is in the sky you're flying and you see two lakes and it looks awful the water looks awful the ground looks awful the world is completely empty you can see two bee doos badus and then you can see like one giant crystal rock over to the right hand side obviously you can go mine that crystal rock um this and this looks terrible this looks awful it's as if it's not done yet okay not engaging no this is it to me it looks beautiful we said this about sword and shield and sword and shield ship pretty much exactly like it looked the wild area looked bad and all those trailers in the wild area continued to look bad when it arrived i know that they can do cities looking good they prove that in sword and shield most like the the fairy town and sword and shield looks fantastic it is this open world stuff that they have been clearly unable to figure out how to do it right i think those lakes look fine that water texture looks awful stop no it's because the way the sun is it's uh 28. screenshot 28 yeah it's probably the worst screenshot out of all of them but it's not that bad it still looks good yeah screenshot three looks great 28 is we're jumping over water right no 28 is bravery 26 is uh oh wait 24 is weird you're over water oh that one's bad too that water's bad too ah what are we looking at 28. no bravery flying over the thing is 32. uh you are on some other location i linked it the electivire looks good at 33. lightning effect in 33 looks good it's all good it's all good how are we i'm on the same page and it has different numbers on my other page this makes sense i don't know what's happening over there for you i bought this what it's the same press release but the numbers are different this is garbage i it's fine yeah i mean like yeah at the end of the day it's fine i played i i played through all of sun and moon and all of x and y on a 3ds the graphics obviously not the number one thing on the domes but the 3ds for graphics but i do think that let's go pikachu let's go eevee looked better than this and i understand it was a smaller game you know they were redoing kanto but that game was vibrant that game had great lines maybe i don't i don't know anything about game development i don't know how hard or simple the back end of that was um and i know that there's like an art style they're trying to do with the paint brushes and the like old and japan ways i get a less detailed more of a just pure color experience why are we skipping over what's in the bag what oh yeah i i was there a giant pail of bags and why do you need to whip the bag at pokemon because maybe you're supposed to eat them corn hole or something no it's no nobody likes het bag it's like a cat for pokemon pokey nip oh probably um okay before we go to diamond pearl uh mr joe from mr cereby.net tweeted i don't think this game is open world anymore wow and there you go well define open world that is that that is the definition i believe not in these uh screenshots we're looking at here but in the japanese website they had more map pictures and it's very clear that the map is broken out into sections um and i remember the the we the this is this is going to come off as like i i told you so a moment and it's it's not really i don't i don't ever want to be that i told you so person what are you shaking your head have you met yourself no it's it's not really that it's the fact that like it's the fact that the people that are going to be upset are the people that had these grand expectations and it was like hey maybe don't have those grand expectations and they were like nope broken world and they're like running with it and they're the ones that are gonna be yelling at me that like they're so upset that well like like what did i do i just said hey they didn't use the words open world any time during the press release so when they originally showed this trailer uh and i was like huh they didn't use the word open world right we've had this conversation i went to the press release they didn't use the world open world i went to the japanese press release they didn't use the world open world but if you read twitter if you read reddit if you talk to anyone who watched this trailer they would have been like wow that open world pokemon game looks good and i'm thinking and i'm still thinking there's not a single video game in history that if they were an open world video game they they would tell you yes that i cannot think of a single open world video game that that didn't pound it into your head that they were open world and they never did this and was like okay maybe they're not doing it for the first press release they didn't do it for the second presser i don't know if this is number four or something like that um like i like if it's an open world video game they hit you over the head that it's open world it is literally a selling point to a video game although i will say i don't think every open world video game needs to be open world because there are some bad ones out there um and one of our i can't remember who was somebody from our slack community went into joe's stream joe was streaming like dynamics adventure it was like the week after arceus was shown and uh i can't remember who it was they'll comment on the podcast i'm sure in fact but they they said joe they said hey do you think that this game is open world and joe said of course it is and they said well they didn't say the world open world in the press release and joe stopped his dynomax adventure and said yeah they did and he went to whatever probably the the website and he command f open world and he was like i'm not making this up this is you go back to a stream you can see it and he goes oh i guess they didn't say the world open world i thought they did well it's pretty obvious it's open world and then he like moved on with his stream i totally get why people might have thought that this game was open world but again i look at the other logic of why didn't they say it like every open world game will hit you over the head with this and if you believe and if you're excited that it's open world and now we're getting to the point where it's it could it could still be open world they haven't said i guess it could still be able to say vast yeah and and what actually defines open world yeah like that again this looks more like a monster hunter than a breath of the wild in terms of maps if it's broken into segments but you can go anywhere in those segments however you wish does that suddenly not make it open world because it's broken into segments i would define open world as i can go there no matter what if i if i start the game i mean tutorial aside there might be a tutorial that's like hey you gotta get your sword before you leave but if i see that mountain that's all the way over there i can go to the mountain in fallout new vegas as soon as i get out of the thing if i want to go all the way to vegas which is on the other end of the map i can ignore every single task and i can get to vegas to start gambling i might i will probably die a million times because there's a bunch of monsters there but i can make it to vegas and i can ignore everything else in breath of the wild as soon as you get out of that tutorial you can go straight to ganondorf if you want you go straight to the desert if you want i consider that open world i don't consider monster hunter stories to open world because i have to do a bunch of tasks on the first island even though i can go anywhere on that island before i get to the second island before it unlocks the second island and i can't go to the third island without completing everything on the second island but what do you call that then not open world i mean open area open yeah an open area then the question is does it become open like is pokemon post game open world because at that point you can travel anywhere in the region yeah i mean i think so it's such a weird like like gate yes it's a weird gate just because things are locked behind gates doesn't sort of change what the gameplay is in those areas as they unlock like a story progression and rpg progression that's trying to tell tell a story tends to lock things behind so that you get the story that out of the way so it's so like again i don't i don't know if open world it's so important that i'd be able to go to any area i want whether or not i can complete anything in that area or i will get murdered in that area for merely stepping foot in there is that more important and that's what has to make it open world like people but like if you look at heart cultural silver gold and silver people liked that because there was an illusion of choice like oh i think an illusion right it is an illusion and oh but then you go get murdered because you're in an area you're not supposed to be it's also an illusion of choice because you're not having a good time there might be something well you know you know there's like five people out there that can do it and they're having a great time i i've done this we went from one city and ran across world of warcraft to get a guild charter signed literally dying and rezzing and dying and resigning dying to prove that we could do it was it fun no you could do it though absolutely awful absolutely was it did it ruin that game at the start sure did but boy i could tell one person we did this and they go wow why and i had no answer so i think that a lot of the issue here is that the kinds of games that were very clearly not open world are not made or played as much anymore so if you think of like doom doom is not open world you start at a spawn point you have to get to the exit you have no choices where where you go from there and the fact that there is so much more choice in how games go anymore and also in the post game right you can go anywhere so that basically does become open world not you can't like walk off the side of the map yeah it's like it's not infinite um that that that's it's it's become so water it's such a watered down concept where you know like was the original uh [Music] zelda open world because you know you had your rectangle you could go north south east west yeah you go wherever you want there would go wherever you wanted you could technically do the dungeons pretty much any order you wanted in the original zelda um although they would be harder they're they're required items like you had to do certain things you couldn't complete them yeah there's no this should not come out of shock that pokemon games are pretty linear you start yeah you go to eight gyms you get to the gyms you go to the elite four there's a little bit of post game there is you could theoretically skip erica's gym and as soon as and go to koga's gym before erica and go to sabrina and as soon as you get surf you could go to blaine and then you could come back and go to erica like you could do a different order and there is this want in the community the pokemon community maybe the hardcore community where this has been said for several years i wish that people want to do gyms in whatever order they want i i i don't know if that makes suddenly makes these games more fun or if suddenly that sells a million more copies because you could do uh olympia before you could do wolf rick well technically you're already doing you could do wolf rick before you could do olympia right like i have played bad open world games like i final fantasy 15 one of my favorite games was open world i after three hours of being like i can i walked over here and there's nothing to do over here why did i walk over here i have to walk back now there's no like i literally have to wear my leather clothes with my leather boy band we gotta walk all the way back because i walked out here i picked up an item that was .1 better than the item i already have and i would gotta hustle back it was a waste of time but you had the car no cause the car can't get off-road i had to walk through some cactuses and up some mountains it was it was bad it was a better car it was a bad experience you get the car that fly the end of final fantasy 15 you get you do get that flying car i know then it comes to final fantasy 14 because i have it um i don't mind linear games i've never really minded i've never really have cared that much that a pokemon is like from start to finish here you go and uh when sword and shield was coming out there was that mistranslation where there would be 16 gyms instead of eight gyms and the internet lost their minds or some people did but i i couldn't help but think man i want to be done with the pokemon after eight gyms like what why do you want to do another eight gems like like i'm sorry it was gold and silver and it was bad well no it's like i want to do eight gyms and then be able to get to to the why is the name of it the final four right the elite four i wanna like not that i have to do sixteen gyms to get to elite four but i get to pick which eight that i do out of the 16 that are available that's what people want yeah maybe but a gym is still a gym and it's very similar to what like isle of armor was right you pick either water or dark and then the other one is closed off to you yeah and i guess it adds replayability i i feel like there's just this like just because a book is longer doesn't mean the book is suddenly better just because a tv show keeps going for seasons doesn't mean that it keeps getting better the thing for open world is people want it to be their story right they don't want to be playing a story written by somebody else they want to believe that this is their story that they are experiencing as they play the game and the less open it is for decisions for you to make than the less of your story that it is then don't play rpgs that somebody else had to program go into tabletop rpgs you could have that experience with your friends at the table the the amount of customization for your character in legends the fact that you can like i know people when they were first got to experience the wild area they were like i'm going to spend 100 hours in the wild area because this is all i ever want to do in pokemon is to run around and catch pokemon and they were perfectly happy yeah yeah and to them that's open world enough yeah i think i think the i have spent hundreds of hours in the isle of armor and the crown tundra um and there are there are some things to do and i think that those games were really good attempts that game freak did like i i do think the crown tundra and the isle of arm i think the isle of armor is better but i think they they it it blows away the original wild area there were more things to do um they were there were things to come back to every day to explore or to pick up items i think they were great expansions and i would assume that legends would be uh more of that where the areas are as big as the crown tundra or the isle of armor but there are four of the areas or five of the areas and you have to you know there might be a loading screen in between or a flying screen in between um and i think that's cool i think that's fine i think that like if if your choice is open world and there's nothing to do in this open world or we're gonna make it more linear but it's going to feel like you're always doing something because we're pushing your forward i'm going to take the linear experience because i don't want a giant big empty open world that there's nothing to do um and if there is something to do the first time is there something to do when i come back to it and i think that's where the crown tundra failed once you did the birds once you caught the legends um once you caught the regis the crown tundra wasn't as fun to explore compared to the isle of armor isla armor was mostly to like pick up like competitive stuff and yeah it was it was just a little bit better in like dailies um and then the only thing you end up doing crown tundra sit in that cave for dynamics adventures which is great dynamics adventures is cool but like crown tundra was just like it it had more things to do in the world but once you did those things there was nothing else to do and so when i'm looking at these screenshots of arceus and i'm like we're flying over on a bravery and there's three badoos in a rock i'm worried like like i get that we're we're five months away from the game they're still gotta add the polish but also are they gonna add like four more pokemon next to those badoos uh is it only gonna be a run rock what else we doing here because once i catch like i mean we don't know what they are real good at taking highly curated shots so they don't give away secrets so they don't give away what other pokemon might be in the area like they are notorious for taking bad shots to keep secrets so i i can't make that call yet because i don't know like what frame they decided to steal this from what was like okay perfect they know beat us in the game and they see nothing else take that moment i am excited for these games i'm very excited for these games yes but i think the the concern that i bring to this show every week is they it's very hard to mess up diamond and pearl like they're remaking oh no they've already messed up diamond and pearl yeah they put the chibis no you don't there's no online puffin making yeah i have to make my coffins on my own that is unacceptable i'm out i'm done not lost interest like i feel i feel like a core game you go to eight gyms you battle the elite four you catch some pokemon like i feel like that that formula is is pretty hard to mess up and there might be somebody that was like well they messed up x and y or they messed up black and white like yeah yeah maybe that's maybe pokemon preference or world preference but like the core formula catch some pokemon battle some gym leaders uh complaining the game is too easy because you've already played 40 versions of these and then c credits like that formula works there's no reason they stray from it they're straying from it here although this isn't like a gen 9 or a gen 10 this is whatever let's go pikachu let's go evie was or whatever weird experiment they want to do i'm good with that props to developers for wanting to try something new big risk i wanted to succeed right i already complained about everything screenshots all right i just i'm just saying like i i i do want it to do well the open world stuff was never make or break for me i am in an unfortunate position sometimes to be a twitch streamer and i am waiting for all those people to come in and complain that the reason this game sucks because it wasn't open world and because they had that expectation your life choice that is my life choice i'll have a person in and say come complain to me but please sub to me first but my but my argument back to them would be like do you re do you really think you would have more enjoyment if you could go battle uh blissey before you battle cleaver is that is that really what was going to make your 60 dollars feel super worth it i don't know like again do you think that battling wolf rick before olympia and x and y do you were like wow wow this game got significantly better because i saw avalon before i saw i don't even know what olympia uses miss maggie is i don't know what stick oh meow stick some pokemon i want the game to be good some fan i am all right well let's take a break then we'll do diamond pearl which i think was more exciting and then we'll do our question of the week pokemon of the week and we'll be right back [Music] max [Music] that is [Music] [Music] a dynamax band and we are back all right last part here new details for diamond pearl the faithful remakes of diamond and pearl versions bring trainers back to sinnoh where they meet professor rowan battle team rocket explorer grand underground team team galactic sorry yeah uh i did garbage okay i didn't learn this until my youtube comments i thought it was pokey tech like technology pokedex oh poke catch i didn't realize that the tch was like the end of watch yeah watch it's a watch i thought it was i thought it was tech like did you not watch the anime no that was the worst version oh what diamond pro anime was i couldn't get past the theme song with people up pip-plop no piplup is the best hip-hop's the best part of the diamond and pearl anime i will give you that and the season one rap is awful look season 2 20 21 you hit 30 seconds forward on the yeah you go skip intro you have to you don't have nothing to hear the diamond pearl anime also has the worst animation it is the like the clunkiest yeah or just the khan wasser of all things visual arts i will say this the art isn't worse what makes it bad is they recycle entire scenes and entire frames over and over and over actually uh traditional japanese animation because i'm not kidding because when they first started doing animation in japan they had very limited supplies so they developed a technique where they would use still frames and move the camera or they would reuse the the the backgrounds and everything like that yeah really obvious in a lot of the enemy episodes well there was what it was like um indigo league orange islands and then johto journeys or whatever journeys yeah all of that was like the same company yeah and then the pokemon company was like we want to do this cheaper and then they and then it got it did cheaper they did cheaper was very apparent when you see some of those seasons all right so okay so is it it's so it's supposed to be pokey watch poke poke poke how do you say it catch pokemon like etch a sketch yeah it's like the poke is a handy gadget for players to receive on their in-game journey that's loaded up with various apps this all-purpose tool has apps for all sorts of situations like the dowsing machine which can be used to locate hidden items uh the poke will also allow players to call wild pokemon to help them out to use hidden moves like cut chop to chop down trees and rock climb to scale cliffs now this i was so excited when the when the trailer happened and they didn't tweet out anything and the press release wasn't up and people were losing their minds about hm's being best that was a glorious can we five minutes can we psa for a minute because there's actually a lot of people who miss this yeah one yes hms are back but yes two you do not have to have them on a pokemon in your party you use the poke etch to call the agent watch the video you use the poke to call the hm one of the local pokemon runs over and does it for you and this is like fine the reason that hms were ever a thing was to gate content to prevent you from going somewhere you're not supposed to get in and open that game yeah um and in in let's go pikachu let's go eevee they were like well we have to we have to prevent players from getting over here because they're not ready to be over here and they did the thing where like pikachu can cut pikachu can surf pikachu can fly pikachu can i don't know what the other one was swim flash and i thought they handled that great like the if you have not played diamond and pearl there's this giant mountain called mount cornet and in order to get to the elite four and to the end of the game you have to well you go through mount cornett multiple times uh there's you have to mount cornets in the middle of the map so you have to cross through it and you have to do it a lot a lot and it's very annoying uh spoiler there's a bunch of geodudes and zubats in that cave i want to just remind everyone that diamond pro were the fourth generation games and generation one zubat geodude generation two zubat geodude generation three zubat geodude sometimes you get a little makahita in there you know mix it up a little bit but do that generation four we're still doing zuma jio dude wanna put that on generation five had a zubat cave or was that six which one had actual zubat cave i think that was black too white too no i think that's actually why yeah excellent like look caves are bad they're just full of zubats no charge stone cave and twist mountain are fantastic yeah they're pretty good and so the problem the problem the problem the issue the problem with diamond and pearl was through these four generations they kept adding more hms this one added rock climb and defog de fog and i think that was it so we're up like a french nobleman with the count to fog so in order to get to the elite four you needed strength you needed surf you needed waterfall yep you needed flash yep up to four you needed rock climb yep you needed cut yep uh you needed rock smash i believe which is not technically an hm but you needed it i don't remember i i thought that was optional i think it was optional but there was like there was stuff behind it yeah yeah uh you needed whirlpool no [Music] you needed to fog yeah i don't think you needed to fog either you didn't well you didn't you you had something you had everything you ever need you never need flash and you never need to fog no no no there's a point where you have you're trying to go a certain area you have to defog it what like you don't have to you can you can walk through it it's the same thing with flash it's the same thing like you don't need flash or defog but it makes it easier yeah so anyways the point is that you need realistically at least six six bare minimum six so if you and and a lot like rock climb and strength they're both normal tight moves i mean rock climb can flinch so you would want it like on a faster pokemon to flinch but strength doesn't i mean strikes a fine move it's not awful but the cuts normal so some players would take like a b barrel and they would do four on that okay so now you don't have a party member because b barrel is taking up the party slot and you still need three more so where are you gonna put that a little here a little bit it was it's such a it's just such an awful experience to go through and have that many like even even going through gold and silver i was like i have one water pokemon on my team i don't want to teach it whirlpool waterfall and surf like but i don't want more than one water pokemon like what am i what but you're bad thinking about something that's not an issue any longer it's not i know but the but this was the biggest issue in diamond pro one was yes no longer and they fixed it and i think they fixed it in a very nice way yes very similar to alola yeah yeah i i'm very happy with this was kind of like the make or break for me was this hm stuff and and they did it i want to remind people they didn't do this for omega ruby alpha sapphire and it was annoying was it not greg it was annoying it was fun you got to fly around in a lot of us that was cool that was amazing that was like six gyms you play though you got a million people who helped you teleport throughout this throughout the world it was amazing you are just a hater 1 000 you just hate things because you are an unhappy individual who cannot find joy in your own life so you take it out on innocent really great games omega ruby alpha sapphire had to say wait for let's go pikachu and dive into pearl to swim just because you didn't like it because of your weird criteria does that mean it's the best not hmm are bad yeah they should have ended after they should have ended with gen 3. and they only double down yeah i mean hms are bad but they lasted and for a very very long time way too long way too long um how many uh poke poke poke how many poke things are there like 52 48 something like that there are apps yeah there's a lot there's like 30 no there has to be more than 40 because you can unlock so some are optional you had to like talk to people but i don't think there's i don't think there's more than 30. uh have fun with pokemon in immediatey square amenity square is a hearth home city a relaxing place where trainers can spend time with their pokemon they'll be able to walk up with six pokemon at a time so long as among the list of pokemon are permitted in the park while in humidity square players can also adjust the camera angle and zoom level to take commemorative photos and videos of their pokemon photos can be taken by using the nintendo switch capture button and look this is not a feature you're just using the what's built into the switch to be like we have photo mode amity it's amity park amity park is the most controversial mm-hmm who are you yeah to tell me which pokemon are cute enough to be in your park i pay the same taxes as you there i agree thank you civil services are for all pokemon available apps in the poke okay 50. seven out of 10 game not enough two too few apps yeah the gatekeeping of what's cute that was truly the worst part of diamond pearl and platinum uh it looks like that this was not the same as sword and shield but you know you gather six pokemon around you stir some pot you throw some whatever in the pot and you have a curry or whatever i used to be able to do with my friends yep but now i can't do it with my friends anymore some faithful reproduction this has now worked pointed out the real flaws make i like how i was mad about arceus and you two are mad about pokemon can snag and raise pokemon conditions such as coolness or cuteness by raising their conditions uh players can get a higher score during the visual evaluation of the super contest shows in diamond and pearl it was only possible to make poffins at the poffin house but now players can make them in a midi amenity square as well dammit amity square the hm thing was big yep yes and i i will never forget atrocious jake and his his chat for me doing a service by mentioning while they were all upset about hm's the reality and they all yelled at me for spoilers and i said it's not a spoiler when they put it the press release yeah twitter and yet they came from my throat and i said fine goodbye and i've written them off forever now you're thinking that will anderson tacked yeah rude i mean people avoid news for days until this show comes up because they don't want to be spoiled but just to point out the ridiculous you know that there's hms in the game because you watched the video and the video clearly shows them calling the hms from the poke etch right where's the spoiler the spoiler was they thought it you had to still have it in your box or in your party and it was just a faster way so you clarified you didn't spoil it correct correct it was a terrible morning i uh expects pokemon fans are literally the worst human beings ever yes that's why we do this podcast yes did you not hear the part about arceus legends and people thinking it was open world am not going back to that we are past that did you remember the oreo part of this podcast did you remember the 40 skin a part of this podcast if anything we have come full circle in what the show has become what i will say as in the designer in me i hate that the poke is jammed in the corner exactly yeah like it like usually when things pop out it has like i don't know how to say it to non-design people there's like a margin like it kind of like floats and it like slides over it just being jammed in the corner seems very like not done so i hope it's actually not done and it looks better when it pops out i get that there's not two screens and it has to pop over whatever it's only when you call it up right like it's not they're all no it's not like permanently yeah yeah it's not like permanently there um the the game freak and whatever they they're usually really good at like like the menus in sword and shield are great like the menus in legends look awesome like uh this poke catch in the corner just looks really out of place so i hope that's not final um but maybe you can move it around through options oh yeah maybe you can like put it where you want that'd be cool like right in the middle so it blocks everything that i'm looking at uh we still don't know about the the gb global battle global trading g what gts this is the global trading station yeah we still don't know what the gts is doing because it's a pokemon home so they've said that it all happened in the union room yeah so what is that building offices now this is what technology does maybe that building is dedicated to making the cell phones and then hoopa's at the top of the floor on the it won't work because they don't have electricity or cell towers or satellites or anything else because it's 16 something just throw the copper wire through them they'll figure it out put in our circuitry they'll be good uh yeah both of these trailers were like [Music] they were just like here are some things to do in the game enjoy i mean i think for i think both did what they needed to do like answered the question about hm's did some more things about the world which you know i mean they did answer the question about the square we we did ask that like what is the square doing if so like they i feel like they are clarifying that the faithful is what we said about was just like a descriptor and not like uh a step-by-step remake of diamond and pearl like i think they needed to show like yes we have changed things ahead of the game and be prepared that atms are different and amity square is different and it's not the exact same game that you played in the past i think that was important for them to show and i think for the arcade trader it was hey you have customizations uh and there are more pokemon that we haven't told you about and i think both were excellent at creating a level of excitement for upcoming products they did exactly what they needed to do did we ever talk about how i don't know if the english i don't know if there's any english press that officially verified this but i wanted to say it was like spanish or something that said that it's only the up to gen 4 pokemon for diamond and pearl look there's nothing i have i saw that somewhere yeah i saw that somewhere too but i don't remember the source so i don't want to fully say but it was like pretty much yeah this is only no gen 5 no gen 6 no gen 7 no gen 8 this is the faithful part of the which is but we can we got time to worry about that later i mean that's the way the let's go games were that's true that's true i mean those were the expectations they set with let's go and sword and shield and there are still people out there being like they're going to add the rest of the pokemon to sword and shield i don't i think that should be sailed [Laughter] and it's available on steam and you can create your own mods for it correct yeah i was talking about some people about this uh yesterday though of like you know we were talking about league of legends and how there's well like 200 champions in league of legends and as like somebody who was like maybe i should get into league where where do you like where did you start like what legend do you pick yeah or buy or unlock or like how do you get into that and unfortunately because you said those words now on this program you will literally get 1 000 tweets no i don't know i want to actually get to the league thinking you actually cared but with something like competitive pokemon if you have 800 pokemon versus 400 pokemon i know some people are like well those other 400 pokemon really weren't meta but there's still a expectation of like there's a lot here where do i start where do i go and i don't think it's fair to be like okay well watch these 17 youtube videos and then go to this website and like then come back and then you know watch these three world championship things they're five hours long each but then you'll really like i just don't think that's fair to tell a player like not ever like there are some players that really want to get into something competitive whether it's league or apex or call of duty or like but there has to be there has to be something in game where it's easy and it's accessible and you can start somewhere because eight no one want to do 20 hours of homework before they want to decide if they want to do something or not like i don't like i want to play apex if i love it then i'll get into the youtube videos so then i'll get the best description of video games in this day and age it's like you have to do homework yeah in order to be able to enjoy a video game it used to be you got a pokemon game it had like a maybe a 20-page manual sure but there were a lot of pictures but when you're ready you knew how to play pokemon now you don't even get a manual and the games are so daggone complex that you've got to perform some sort of arcane ritual just to understand which menu to go do to get to the thing that you want yeah so like for sword shield you know you you cut half the pokemon you get rid of 90 garbage like most people can't even remember what moves they got rid of they got rid of like 90 moves i can only think of one which is hidden power like i can't think hidden power in return no toxic is still there it's just not every pokemon has it yeah that's rude every every pokemon has the right to be toxic anyways uh question of the week all right hold on ooh he's got to wet his whistle yep question question question of the week sent to us from our fans this is from chris oh i i don't watch enough friends to answer matt's question uh i've seen every episode of friends i've seen every episode of friends but what did chris have to say chris says what is the spookiest non-ghost type pokemon gigolith [Laughter] i mean honestly it's geo dude the original moving way too many mouths and when it mega evolves it's got it way too many balls is a cutie ma while it's terrifying to be on my competitive vgc team and used to do fantastic work for me do you will not malign my ma while grim snarl is also quite terrifying true yeah let's not ghost gripstar is a good one yeah what about weeping belle i mean we've been balanced it'll eat you alive it would dissolve your bones okay can you guys quickly do the friends question from that if sitcom friends had a cast of cast swapped with pokemon which pokemon would play each character oh good lord uh gardevar would be rachel um indeedy would be uh monica don't know these people uh we need somebody with like some amount of music for phoebe but not all yeah but like spacey i feel like i feel like baby would you slowpoke yeah yeah like a meow stick or a slope hook uh no meowstics too intelligent what about psyduck could be psychophoebe uh chandler has a sarcastic yeah yeah i could see a grim snarl or what's the impedim but what's the one after more more grim for chandler because chandler doesn't fully evolve in that series at all uh then joey's super cute and strong and but also uh not intelligent yeah he's like my champ yeah and then look which is the worst fossils timber timber joey oh yeah he's a temper but yeah cordelia for ross because ross is the worst character yes and he's into dinosaurs so he picks yes yes okay i only know phoebe from friends [Laughter] uh from youtube if you are watching on youtube feel free to like comment subscribe share all that stuff thank you for watching on youtube um but if you want and we'll have the question of the week for next week we're gonna do james this week they say hey steve greg and will big fan of the podcast thanks for all you do i'm about to be a dad in february what would you say is the most important thing for jesus what would you say is the most important thing for me to pass down onto the next generation of pokemon fans be happy with what you this is life advice be happy with what you get yeah enjoy the games for what they are don't expect them to do something that they're not uh i will say this for most parents who want their kids to like what they like they like don't force it on them just keep having it being a big part of your life because kids want to be included on your life so if you invite them in on your journey they're a lot more they're a lot more willing to join and like the thing that you like then is like oh i'm going to force this on you're going to put all these things into your into your head like continue being unashamed of your love of pokemon and your kid will want to be a part of that with you as somebody who read a lot of children's books in the last month to children uh get those pokemon child books those like they're very good they're they're super good like i bought them just because i was like well maybe one day i'll have kids and they're not going to be available for every forever right like books you know they make some money and then they don't make any more not true yeah that's not true if it's only sold on pokemon center i feel like it well technically they put it on amazon too but they did sell out at one point i think they restocked but i went through those books and they're really well made they're really cute um they're like thick there's like a lot of pages get those kids books they're awesome they're like they're on amazon they should be back in stockholm pokemon center just there's four of them get all four they're really great there's colors there's shapes i finally learned what a triangle was last week it was awesome um there's good job letters and i think there's numbers but also like to pass down for your kids like everything that you like let them know like i know a lot of parents like my parents a lot of people from engineers like their parents really they kept their lives very separate and their interests very separate and so it kids just want to spend time with you and like the things that you like so just always be true about like if you are a huge pokemon fan just keep being a big pokemon fan and also accept the fact if your children don't don't like it don't take it stick to it yeah like i'm i'm sorry that your kid is a star baseball player and just never enjoyed pokemon how unfortunate and sad for you go to the kids baseball games and let them enjoy the things that they enjoy play your switch while they're doing whatever they do out there exactly spinning in a circle well pokemon of the week all right last
