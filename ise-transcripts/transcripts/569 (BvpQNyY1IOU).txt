[Music] (0:01 - 0:13)
[Applause] (0:12 - 0:20)
[Music] (0:13 - 0:20)
what's up everyone welcome to the (0:22 - 0:27)
569th episode of the Pokemon podcast (0:25 - 0:30)
it's super effective I'm your host Steve (0:27 - 0:32)
with me is Hannah (0:30 - 0:35)
I caught so many aksu yesterday I am (0:32 - 0:37)
still kind of mentally exhausted from (0:35 - 0:38)
that (0:37 - 0:43)
I I it was a very intense day (0:38 - 0:43)
[Laughter] (0:44 - 0:51)
you know we should have got into the art (0:49 - 0:53)
park because it didn't rain up at my (0:51 - 0:55)
house at all we went to Gold Medal park (0:53 - 0:56)
because Steve's like let's go there (0:55 - 0:58)
because it's a farmer market and what (0:56 - 0:59)
did he bring with him torrential (0:58 - 1:01)
rainstorms and hail (0:59 - 1:06)
I got pelted by hail waiting to find out (1:01 - 1:08)
where Steve had hidden himself the (1:06 - 1:10)
reason I wasn't texting you is because I (1:08 - 1:14)
was also getting felted by hail and I (1:10 - 1:18)
was trying to find a non-hale location (1:14 - 1:18)
sounds like y'all should have gone to (1:20 - 1:23)
the mall we ended up at the mall (1:21 - 1:27)
yeah the day turned from a pleasant (1:23 - 1:29)
stroll outside to an absolute Mall (1:27 - 1:30)
nightmare (1:29 - 1:33)
we you know we we can't uh Niantic just (1:30 - 1:35)
drops the ball every Community Day this (1:33 - 1:37)
time bad weather (1:35 - 1:39)
well it's not because that those cards (1:37 - 1:41)
were stolen so this is all stemming from (1:39 - 1:44)
that also (1:41 - 1:48)
we're never going back to that BW that (1:44 - 1:50)
was the worst service we have ever had (1:48 - 1:55)
in my entire life we got there at five (1:50 - 2:01)
we got food kind of at 6 (1:55 - 2:04)
15.3 dubs (2:01 - 2:06)
I mean I was I was doing I was doing (2:04 - 2:08)
lucky trade after lucky trade at the BW (2:06 - 2:11)
so much my time was flying I will say (2:08 - 2:13)
that Debbie dubs was terrible service (2:11 - 2:15)
the worst (2:13 - 2:16)
pretty bad if we should have went to (2:15 - 2:18)
Rainforest Cafe we should have been a (2:16 - 2:20)
hot defense and gone and visited the (2:18 - 2:22)
rain but we know I mean I felt like (2:20 - 2:26)
doubling against the racist oh yeah okay (2:22 - 2:28)
yeah Rainforest Cafe (2:26 - 2:30)
constantly has a line at Mall of America (2:28 - 2:32)
yep (2:30 - 2:34)
and they don't even have live Birds (2:32 - 2:36)
anymore which is appropriate because (2:34 - 2:38)
those poor birds were literally being (2:36 - 2:41)
tormented by children and the noises (2:38 - 2:44)
that the Rainforest Cafe made but they (2:41 - 2:47)
used to have live Birds oh we should (2:44 - 2:48)
have got Hibachi I always forget there's (2:47 - 2:50)
a Hibachi place we should just leave the (2:48 - 2:54)
mall and go across the street to IHOP (2:50 - 2:54)
but then we don't get to pay the mall (2:54 - 2:59)
attacks (2:56 - 2:59)
yeah that beat up is a bad experience uh (2:59 - 3:04)
speaking of a bad experience uh we're (3:02 - 3:06)
gonna talk about TCG live yeah I see how (3:04 - 3:09)
I work that Segway in yeah it was a (3:06 - 3:11)
great segue uh we got TCG live there's a (3:09 - 3:13)
new Team Rocket collection coming to (3:11 - 3:14)
Pokemon Center (3:13 - 3:16)
um Pokemon go Fest actually has details (3:14 - 3:20)
and believe it or not scarlet and raids (3:16 - 3:23)
are scarlet and violet rays are coming (3:20 - 3:24)
back (3:23 - 3:26)
if you have Violet you know you're not (3:24 - 3:28)
getting any raids but Violet kids (3:26 - 3:30)
nothing Scarlet only Scarlett always (3:28 - 3:33)
wins out yeah they got that Karai down (3:30 - 3:35)
there (3:33 - 3:35)
um (3:35 - 3:38)
yeah let's start with uh TCG live I (3:35 - 3:40)
mentioned this last week just for a (3:38 - 3:42)
split second we had a very loaded show (3:40 - 3:44)
last week so he didn't (3:42 - 3:46)
we didn't really have time to talk about (3:44 - 3:46)
it (3:46 - 3:48)
but technically I think TCG live was (3:46 - 3:51)
down for like three days like (3:48 - 3:54)
um TCGO ended and then TCG live went (3:51 - 3:56)
down for like the complete (3:54 - 3:57)
I think that's how what happened or was (3:56 - 3:59)
down for a little bit (3:57 - 4:01)
um I just hit the migrate button and (3:59 - 4:04)
then I didn't reopen the app but uh this (4:01 - 4:07)
is off pokemon.com T Pokemon TCG live (4:04 - 4:10)
launches worldwide alongside scarlet and (4:07 - 4:13)
violet palde evolved if you're listening (4:10 - 4:16)
to this on Monday June 12th paldaya (4:13 - 4:18)
evolved came out on I think June 9th (4:16 - 4:19)
world (4:18 - 4:22)
not worldwide because technically it was (4:19 - 4:24)
already out in Japan months ago (4:22 - 4:26)
you can battle players around the world (4:24 - 4:29)
in Pokemon TCG Mansion matches with the (4:26 - 4:31)
official release of Pokemon Trading Card (4:29 - 4:34)
Game Live Now out of global beta that (4:31 - 4:36)
was a that was a bad mistake they gave (4:34 - 4:39)
us the latest way to experience the (4:36 - 4:43)
excitement of the Pokemon TCG uh and its (4:39 - 4:46)
newest expansion paldea evolve that's (4:43 - 4:48)
not all there's a brand new battle pass (4:46 - 4:50)
featuring the pop just a heads up you (4:48 - 4:53)
cannot give this game money (4:50 - 4:54)
um there's a brand new battle pass (4:53 - 4:58)
featuring Chen Pao ex and Fortress ex (4:54 - 5:01)
players can unlock a deck featuring Chen (4:58 - 5:04)
pow ex and a base with the basic battle (5:01 - 5:07)
pass and you could upgrade to the (5:04 - 5:09)
premium battle pass to unlock a deck (5:07 - 5:11)
featuring Fortress ex battle players (5:09 - 5:13)
online and complete your daily quest to (5:11 - 5:16)
level up the battle pass earn more cards (5:13 - 5:17)
blah blah (5:16 - 5:20)
how do you upgrade (5:17 - 5:20)
so uh when you buy real packs those (5:22 - 5:28)
codes give you stuff and then when you (5:25 - 5:31)
just play the game you get the stuff I (5:28 - 5:33)
think they're like purple Gems or (5:31 - 5:34)
whatever (5:33 - 5:36)
um but you can use the purple gems to (5:34 - 5:38)
buy the battle pass no way to get the (5:36 - 5:41)
game money (5:38 - 5:42)
so you pretty much gotta like log in (5:41 - 5:44)
every day play a couple matches every (5:42 - 5:46)
day buy a couple booster packs and (5:44 - 5:48)
that's that's the that's the currency (5:46 - 5:51)
that you're using my limited view (5:48 - 5:55)
of reactions to this have all been bad (5:51 - 5:58)
oh yeah I have not seen a single person (5:55 - 6:00)
happy about that not a person (5:58 - 6:05)
is thrilled with the TCG live (6:00 - 6:05)
uh (6:06 - 6:08)
including this poor person on Reddit (6:09 - 6:14)
whose entire life has been ruined (6:11 - 6:16)
because there's not expanded in the game (6:14 - 6:19)
yeah uh I don't have that post in front (6:16 - 6:21)
of me um we don't need to read the post (6:19 - 6:22)
I mostly put in the notes to remind (6:21 - 6:25)
myself because nowhere nowhere is this (6:22 - 6:28)
mentioned that (6:25 - 6:28)
um I I will read a cleaned up version of (6:28 - 6:33)
the headline no expanded that's all I (6:30 - 6:35)
play this stinks (6:33 - 6:38)
[Laughter] (6:35 - 6:40)
it's the first text I got back from my (6:38 - 6:44)
friend after they moved their cards over (6:40 - 6:44)
yeah I I it's (6:45 - 6:48)
the the crazy thing here is that (6:49 - 6:55)
this game was announced and was supposed (6:53 - 6:59)
to release sometime around bdsp (6:55 - 7:02)
and then they delayed it (6:59 - 7:04)
now just think of this for a second (7:02 - 7:07)
remember just just you think of like (7:04 - 7:10)
Pokemon go but (7:07 - 7:12)
Pokemon scarlet and violet where people (7:10 - 7:14)
are like they should delay the game (7:12 - 7:18)
oh they did for this they did it it (7:14 - 7:20)
didn't get any better (7:18 - 7:22)
they get they delay this game for over (7:20 - 7:24)
again I want to stress that this game (7:22 - 7:26)
was supposed to come out around the time (7:24 - 7:29)
of bdsp that was well or we've gotten (7:26 - 7:33)
hoop come on game since bdsp and this (7:29 - 7:38)
this is not better now now dear listener (7:33 - 7:39)
if you're driving in your car I want you (7:38 - 7:41)
to pull over and I want you to think (7:39 - 7:44)
about this situation which is uh (7:41 - 7:46)
remember when people are like they (7:44 - 7:48)
should take Pokemon go away from Niantic (7:46 - 7:50)
and give it to somebody else they should (7:48 - 7:52)
take Scarlet they should take main (7:50 - 7:54)
Series games away from game freaking (7:52 - 7:57)
give it to somebody else they took the (7:54 - 8:00)
Pokemon Trading Card Game online and (7:57 - 8:03)
they gave it to somebody else their own (8:00 - 8:05)
internal company or whatever they gave (8:03 - 8:09)
it to themselves that is bad (8:05 - 8:13)
so they changed they changed the (8:09 - 8:15)
developer from direwolf digital to (8:13 - 8:17)
whoever it is now it could be not (8:15 - 8:19)
internal they're just not revealing the (8:17 - 8:22)
names because they it took a while ago (8:19 - 8:28)
[Laughter] (8:22 - 8:32)
nothing but pain they delayed this game (8:28 - 8:35)
multiple times and it is (8:32 - 8:39)
terrible and I do look I I would never (8:35 - 8:42)
play expanded because I think expanded (8:39 - 8:47)
is uh two yeah it's too fun and I hate (8:42 - 8:50)
fun so I would not play expanded but it (8:47 - 8:54)
is actually mind-boggling to me that you (8:50 - 8:58)
have so many people who like played TCGO (8:54 - 9:01)
with expanded they have all their cards (8:58 - 9:04)
there tcgos existed for 12 some years (9:01 - 9:07)
and you know to be completely Fair it (9:04 - 9:08)
wasn't a great product when it first (9:07 - 9:11)
launched I remember I was there (9:08 - 9:15)
but to be to force everyone to move over (9:11 - 9:19)
and then we have no clue when expanded (9:15 - 9:22)
is coming and so those players (9:19 - 9:24)
don't have anything to play anymore they (9:22 - 9:27)
just even if TCGO was still up and (9:24 - 9:28)
running and it was like oh you can't add (9:27 - 9:30)
palde evolved or you can't add the next (9:28 - 9:33)
set at least they could play something (9:30 - 9:34)
um (9:33 - 9:40)
and we have we have no we have what (9:34 - 9:45)
[Laughter] (9:40 - 9:47)
July of works it like you know it's a (9:45 - 9:49)
little slower I've seen people say like (9:47 - 9:51)
hey I've I used to be able to do six (9:49 - 9:55)
matches in an hour with t PTC geo with (9:51 - 9:58)
ptcgl the new one I can only do like (9:55 - 10:00)
four three or four matches an hour (9:58 - 10:03)
because and that speaks to like just how (10:00 - 10:05)
long everything takes in the game the (10:03 - 10:07)
animations and stuff even if you're like (10:05 - 10:10)
okay well I can still play (10:07 - 10:13)
the fact that (10:10 - 10:13)
expanded is just gone and we have no (10:13 - 10:17)
release date of when expanded is coming (10:15 - 10:21)
you can't even look at your cards (10:17 - 10:22)
um (10:21 - 10:24)
the at least that I could find somebody (10:22 - 10:25)
can correct me and like the comments or (10:24 - 10:29)
on slack or whatever but like I traded (10:25 - 10:31)
um a full art Reshiram for a full art (10:29 - 10:33)
Zekrom because I opened up like two Rush (10:31 - 10:36)
Rams when I was like opening packs so I (10:33 - 10:39)
traded one right before tcgl (10:36 - 10:42)
or ptcgo closed (10:39 - 10:44)
and I can't even look at those cards (10:42 - 10:47)
like I tried like like my my collection (10:44 - 10:49)
transferred but because they're older (10:47 - 10:53)
than sun and moon I think they're (10:49 - 10:56)
considered expanded so they're somewhere (10:53 - 10:58)
in my collection but I can't see them (10:56 - 11:00)
physically right now (10:58 - 11:03)
that's absurd if there's a way to see (11:00 - 11:05)
them (11:03 - 11:05)
I've looked top and bottom in a very lit (11:05 - 11:11)
like it's like there's a lot of buttons (11:09 - 11:13)
to press (11:11 - 11:13)
I have been watching videos of people (11:14 - 11:20)
trying to use TCG live (11:16 - 11:20)
it would be more funny if it wasn't (11:22 - 11:27)
heartbreaking that just watching them (11:24 - 11:30)
try to interact I like watch this video (11:27 - 11:34)
of this poor person trying to put a (11:30 - 11:36)
Pokemon from the bench (11:34 - 11:38)
into play (11:36 - 11:41)
for 30 seconds just (11:38 - 11:44)
nothing's happening just click it and (11:41 - 11:46)
push it and nothing and they're just (11:44 - 11:48)
like (11:46 - 11:50)
and then (11:48 - 11:53)
like 40 seconds later through completely (11:50 - 11:55)
random chance everything reshuffles and (11:53 - 11:57)
the one that they selected goes out (11:55 - 12:00)
front like there's no like what is (11:57 - 12:07)
happening how you delayed you delayed it (12:00 - 12:07)
don't I (12:08 - 12:12)
don't understand they should have done (12:09 - 12:13)
the Google thing and just kept it in (12:12 - 12:16)
beta forever (12:13 - 12:16)
how is this gonna look at this how good (12:17 - 12:20)
how is this gonna work on the new Apple (12:19 - 12:23)
Super Goggles if it doesn't even work on (12:20 - 12:27)
a desktop how am I gonna live my life (12:23 - 12:30)
appropriately if uh well it technically (12:27 - 12:32)
works on our iPhone now so that's (12:30 - 12:35)
technically something yeah that is that (12:32 - 12:36)
is the one thing that I was excited (12:35 - 12:38)
about as someone who will probably never (12:36 - 12:39)
pick it up for anything other than to (12:38 - 12:42)
put card codes in there (12:39 - 12:44)
um I've never really been able to play (12:42 - 12:45)
computer games I didn't have a computer (12:44 - 12:48)
powerful enough to play computer games (12:45 - 12:51)
of any sort until (12:48 - 12:54)
the last year (12:51 - 12:56)
um and so I'm grateful that it's on (12:54 - 12:59)
mobile now but it doesn't work so that (12:56 - 13:02)
doesn't help much I mean (12:59 - 13:05)
we almost got there here's the thing is (13:02 - 13:07)
on the thing you could play it on it's (13:05 - 13:09)
not playable just (13:07 - 13:11)
ignore that part of it (13:09 - 13:13)
I do have a little bit of side news (13:11 - 13:16)
related to this because I was uh I was (13:13 - 13:18)
perusing Pokemon Center we'll get to (13:16 - 13:20)
that a little bit later but they (13:18 - 13:24)
launched three new hoodies on Pokemon (13:20 - 13:27)
Center yeah they did Pokemon Trading (13:24 - 13:30)
Card Game Live red pullover blue (13:27 - 13:32)
pullover yellow pullover which (13:30 - 13:35)
I feel like you're kind of stuck buying (13:32 - 13:38)
the pullover where that is like your (13:35 - 13:40)
Pokemon go team yeah no those are the (13:38 - 13:43)
Pokemon go colors (13:40 - 13:44)
yeah yeah (13:43 - 13:47)
I when I first saw them I thought why is (13:44 - 13:49)
there another set of go and they didn't (13:47 - 13:51)
even get the logos on them and then (13:49 - 13:53)
they're like and then you read it and (13:51 - 13:54)
I'm like (13:53 - 13:58)
they use the same colors (13:54 - 14:02)
uh yes (13:58 - 14:02)
they're pretty generic hoodies I mean (14:02 - 14:07)
they they are very generic hoodies (14:05 - 14:09)
yeah I don't I don't know the quality (14:07 - 14:11)
but for (14:09 - 14:13)
it's the audio podcast but it's it's (14:11 - 14:16)
just like a blue (14:13 - 14:16)
um like striped hoodie with a (14:16 - 14:22)
slightly stylized Pokeball and that's (14:19 - 14:24)
kind of it and then just replace the (14:22 - 14:25)
blue with either red or replace the red (14:24 - 14:27)
with yellow (14:25 - 14:29)
um so they are they are very reminiscent (14:27 - 14:31)
of Pokemon go so I suppose if you're (14:29 - 14:33)
team Mystic you're kind of stuck picking (14:31 - 14:34)
the blue because if you're walking (14:33 - 14:37)
around with a yellow Pokeball hoodie (14:34 - 14:38)
people probably are gonna think you're (14:37 - 14:39)
on team instinct which is the better (14:38 - 14:42)
team you should just go with your colors (14:39 - 14:45)
that you prefer and ignore what go is (14:42 - 14:47)
trying to force into your but in go (14:45 - 14:49)
didn't you go with your preferred color (14:47 - 14:51)
I bet it did go with yellow because that (14:49 - 14:54)
was my favorite color yes (14:51 - 14:57)
also because it was also the team that (14:54 - 15:00)
everybody else was like (14:57 - 15:00)
that is the only way to go I will say we (15:00 - 15:05)
haven't we didn't talk about this we're (15:03 - 15:07)
going to talk a lot about Pokemon Center (15:05 - 15:10)
coming up their exercise outfits their (15:07 - 15:13)
thing with craft yeah those Rayquaza the (15:10 - 15:18)
Raymond Quasar shirt shorts are amazing (15:13 - 15:21)
Pikachu shirt is amazing but they are (15:18 - 15:24)
way too expensive I I looked at those (15:21 - 15:27)
they definitely caught my eye one of the (15:24 - 15:28)
shirts some of the Rayquaza stuff but (15:27 - 15:30)
they're like a hundred dollars per piece (15:28 - 15:33)
they are great looking but I am not (15:30 - 15:36)
paying sixty dollars (15:33 - 15:39)
for Raymond Quasar shorts now if (15:36 - 15:41)
somebody wants to pay sixty dollars and (15:39 - 15:43)
send them to me I am not going to stop (15:41 - 15:44)
you (15:43 - 15:48)
uh so PO Box is in my link tree but (15:44 - 15:52)
they are really really good but these (15:48 - 15:56)
these pullover hoodies are boring (15:52 - 15:59)
uh yeah they they're only 35 which is (15:56 - 16:02)
like in this economy a reasonable price (15:59 - 16:05)
for a hoodie the interesting thing here (16:02 - 16:05)
though (16:05 - 16:08)
is not the hoodie itself but it comes (16:05 - 16:11)
with a digital code so if you buy a (16:08 - 16:14)
hoodie you will get one of each red (16:11 - 16:16)
yellow and blue deck accessory nine (16:14 - 16:20)
items total and you will get 13 in-game (16:16 - 16:22)
booster packs (16:20 - 16:25)
in (16:22 - 16:27)
TCGO (16:25 - 16:29)
unfortunately I don't think you get the (16:27 - 16:33)
hoodie in TCGO but you get (16:29 - 16:33)
that's how bad these hoodies are is (16:38 - 16:41)
they're giving you products for a game (16:40 - 16:43)
that doesn't even exist anymore yes sir (16:41 - 16:46)
sorry TCG live so you're getting the (16:43 - 16:49)
most generic deck boxes coin coins and (16:46 - 16:51)
sleeves that would technically be (16:49 - 16:53)
exclusive to prove that you purchased a (16:51 - 16:56)
hoodie uh and you get 13 booster packs (16:53 - 16:58)
which is kind of cool the 13 booster (16:56 - 17:00)
packs is actually kind of cool (16:58 - 17:02)
um (17:00 - 17:02)
make up the price of the hoodie if you (17:03 - 17:08)
bought them in real life (17:06 - 17:10)
oh yeah it would be like 13 times four (17:08 - 17:15)
technically yeah close (17:10 - 17:15)
um apparently you're getting (17:16 - 17:19)
specifically you're getting (17:17 - 17:20)
um (17:19 - 17:23)
seven sword and shield (17:20 - 17:23)
seven in total one booster pack from (17:26 - 17:29)
each of the following oh okay okay (17:28 - 17:31)
you're getting a one Fusion strike one (17:29 - 17:33)
brilliant Stars One astral Radiance one (17:31 - 17:35)
lost origin one silver Tempest One Crown (17:33 - 17:38)
Zenith and then you're getting (17:35 - 17:39)
um (17:38 - 17:41)
two of each you're getting two paldea (17:39 - 17:44)
evolve two obsidian Flames I don't know (17:41 - 17:45)
how that works because that's not out (17:44 - 17:49)
yet and then two base scarlet and violet (17:45 - 17:49)
email oh gift code evil will be on July (17:50 - 17:55)
14th (17:54 - 17:57)
got it so they will email you separately (17:55 - 17:59)
for the code (17:57 - 18:00)
that's a little bit bummer I thought the (17:59 - 18:03)
code would like come in like a little (18:00 - 18:06)
card in the hoodie that you (18:03 - 18:11)
[Laughter] (18:06 - 18:13)
that like they have like an IRL product (18:11 - 18:16)
to relate back they do this a lot with (18:13 - 18:18)
Pokemon go and I I do like it like oh if (18:16 - 18:20)
you purchase like a Pokemon go shirt (18:18 - 18:21)
you're gonna get like the in-game shirt (18:20 - 18:23)
in Pokemon go I think that stuff is (18:21 - 18:24)
pretty neat (18:23 - 18:25)
um (18:24 - 18:27)
I wish the hoodie was not as generic but (18:25 - 18:32)
and I wish ptcg live was uh good (18:27 - 18:35)
I do feel bad for you know we talk about (18:32 - 18:37)
people playing Pokemon go every day or (18:35 - 18:38)
Pokemon Masters every day or Pokemon (18:37 - 18:40)
unite every day there are people who (18:38 - 18:42)
play the Pokemon Trading Card Game (18:40 - 18:46)
digitally every day and they have a (18:42 - 18:48)
significantly worse product now and it's (18:46 - 18:50)
just a bummer like that's where the (18:48 - 18:52)
complaints are coming from it's like I (18:50 - 18:55)
don't I wish it was better because I (18:52 - 18:59)
I played a lot of PTC Geo when it lived (18:55 - 19:01)
um it was like one of the first games I (18:59 - 19:03)
streamed like daily on Twitch (19:01 - 19:05)
and (19:03 - 19:08)
like it was I panic moved my entire (19:05 - 19:10)
collection because I had a really big (19:08 - 19:13)
collection to move and so like I had I (19:10 - 19:14)
had um (19:13 - 19:17)
I had almost 400 booster packs that I (19:14 - 19:20)
opened last minute and (19:17 - 19:22)
it was like fun to open those and I kept (19:20 - 19:24)
them there was a lot I had sealed for (19:22 - 19:25)
years because I was like I'm gonna do (19:24 - 19:27)
something with these one day and then I (19:25 - 19:29)
never did anything with those one day (19:27 - 19:32)
but uh yeah it's a bummer hopefully it (19:29 - 19:33)
gets better (19:32 - 19:35)
um I don't know (19:33 - 19:37)
I don't know when that is right like (19:35 - 19:40)
again we I was like hey they delayed the (19:37 - 19:42)
game they did and it's not in a better (19:40 - 19:44)
state so I don't want to be like ah they (19:42 - 19:46)
just needed like another six months I (19:44 - 19:47)
don't know what they need (19:46 - 19:52)
that I I don't but I'm very excited for (19:47 - 19:54)
the direworld digital documentary that (19:52 - 19:56)
will (19:54 - 19:59)
hopefully they come to light that they (19:56 - 20:00)
tried everything and the Pokemon company (19:59 - 20:02)
was very difficult to work with and (20:00 - 20:03)
that's why (20:02 - 20:06)
I don't know (20:03 - 20:06)
maybe one day (20:07 - 20:11)
Greg you you play the magic uh digital (20:13 - 20:17)
game (20:16 - 20:20)
so the biggest problem with arena is (20:17 - 20:23)
their most popular format Commander (20:20 - 20:25)
isn't in Arena (20:23 - 20:28)
they have that sounds familiar they have (20:25 - 20:31)
some forms of it they have like historic (20:28 - 20:34)
which is only a 60 deck which is (20:31 - 20:35)
technically oath breaker because oath (20:34 - 20:38)
breaker is a new format (20:35 - 20:40)
um it is the the fact that the commander (20:38 - 20:43)
isn't in there has caused controversy (20:40 - 20:45)
but the main reason why Commander isn't (20:43 - 20:48)
in the in Arena is because (20:45 - 20:51)
Commander can use any card from any time (20:48 - 20:53)
and (20:51 - 20:55)
all of the cards that have ever existed (20:53 - 20:59)
in Magic are not in Arena uh because (20:55 - 21:00)
that is (20:59 - 21:04)
almost an impossible task uh to go back (21:00 - 21:09)
and try to get everything in but (21:04 - 21:09)
my biggest problem with arena is (21:09 - 21:15)
the fact that (21:13 - 21:18)
magic is trying to make money off of (21:15 - 21:21)
both products so they're trying to make (21:18 - 21:27)
money off of Arena and off of (21:21 - 21:27)
physical card games and the way that (21:27 - 21:32)
they've decided to differentiate them is (21:30 - 21:35)
they added a mechanic that is kind of (21:32 - 21:37)
specific this Alchemy mechanic that's (21:35 - 21:39)
kind of specific to Arena where you can (21:37 - 21:42)
alter cards (21:39 - 21:44)
that you couldn't do (21:42 - 21:46)
outside of the game and so it's created (21:44 - 21:48)
this really weird dynamic of people who (21:46 - 21:51)
play Arena and are used to playing that (21:48 - 21:54)
and play there don't want to go to the (21:51 - 21:56)
card game because they're like well I (21:54 - 21:58)
can't play my decks the way I play them (21:56 - 22:00)
and then the other thing is people who (21:58 - 22:02)
play Paper like I don't understand what (22:00 - 22:03)
this mechanic does at all it doesn't (22:02 - 22:06)
translate none of my skills do (22:03 - 22:08)
there's a lot of people who are like I (22:06 - 22:11)
mean arena is a gorgeous product like it (22:08 - 22:14)
it works really well it Smooths when (22:11 - 22:16)
they put out the things you know it's a (22:14 - 22:20)
money sink uh but it sounds like they're (22:16 - 22:22)
two different games yeah you can give (22:20 - 22:24)
Arena like real money right you can give (22:22 - 22:26)
Arena a lot of money (22:24 - 22:28)
uh and you can't anything you've bought (22:26 - 22:31)
in person doesn't apply to Arena so (22:28 - 22:34)
anytime if you play Both Sides you are (22:31 - 22:38)
paying double for almost everything so (22:34 - 22:39)
it's really kind of split the magic (22:38 - 22:41)
community in a lot of ways and the fact (22:39 - 22:42)
that there are now people who will only (22:41 - 22:45)
play Arena because that's what I think (22:42 - 22:48)
Pokemon was trying not to do right (22:45 - 22:51)
and I recommend them for that if if the (22:48 - 22:53)
product works that would be great (22:51 - 22:56)
I really wish Arena (22:53 - 22:59)
I wish they had codes that you had for (22:56 - 23:01)
your like they had (22:59 - 23:03)
pack codes when you bought a pack you (23:01 - 23:05)
could put a code in you kind of get they (23:03 - 23:08)
have some of those things but not a lot (23:05 - 23:11)
um because they really do want to make (23:08 - 23:13)
a lot of money off of Arena and it's (23:11 - 23:15)
really (23:13 - 23:19)
it's not ideal like it's just not (23:15 - 23:21)
it is I don't think it's been (23:19 - 23:23)
particularly great (23:21 - 23:26)
for the magic Community I do think the (23:23 - 23:28)
project is great for teaching people how (23:26 - 23:30)
to play Magic because you can start for (23:28 - 23:32)
free and you get basic decks and it (23:30 - 23:34)
tells you the rules there's a lot of (23:32 - 23:35)
rules that I learned from there that I'm (23:34 - 23:36)
like (23:35 - 23:39)
oh I didn't know that was a thing nobody (23:36 - 23:41)
told me (23:39 - 23:43)
um but you can't you can get really deep (23:41 - 23:46)
into it and spend a lot of money and (23:43 - 23:47)
then be like well I have no money left (23:46 - 23:50)
for paper magic uh this is the only (23:47 - 23:53)
thing I do now (23:50 - 23:54)
yeah that was the one thing I liked (23:53 - 23:56)
about PT's Geo is when people would like (23:54 - 23:58)
Come Into My Stream (23:56 - 24:00)
and they would be like oh man I love eye (23:58 - 24:02)
color cars I should really start playing (24:00 - 24:04)
I just don't know how to like play or or (24:02 - 24:06)
learn and I was like oh just download (24:04 - 24:10)
PTC Geo like it PG's PTC Geo didn't look (24:06 - 24:13)
the best it was very outdated in its (24:10 - 24:14)
Style (24:13 - 24:16)
but (24:14 - 24:19)
um the like intro tutorial was so good (24:16 - 24:21)
at like teaching you how to play yeah (24:19 - 24:22)
and like understanding you and walking (24:21 - 24:24)
you through (24:22 - 24:24)
um (24:24 - 24:26)
and the nice thing is (24:24 - 24:29)
like you can't just make up your own (24:26 - 24:31)
rules in the digital game because it's (24:29 - 24:33)
like nope that's you that's not allowed (24:31 - 24:35)
that's not a rule you can't play two (24:33 - 24:37)
energies you well I mean you can but (24:35 - 24:40)
with specific cards (24:37 - 24:40)
um (24:42 - 24:45)
all right well I mean like we can only (24:43 - 24:48)
hope that TCG live gets better uh paldea (24:45 - 24:51)
evolved is out it's the next big set (24:48 - 24:54)
um we won't go too deep into that this (24:51 - 24:57)
episode but uh let's take a break (24:54 - 24:59)
because we're gonna talk about go Fest (24:57 - 25:01)
and that's gonna be its whole We're Not (24:59 - 25:03)
Gonna touch on the team Rockets coming (25:01 - 25:05)
to Pokemon we'll Circle back to Pokemon (25:03 - 25:07)
Center we have to Circle back to your (25:05 - 25:09)
night too to even put that on there yeah (25:07 - 25:10)
we can Circle back to unite let's get (25:09 - 25:13)
the let's get the (25:10 - 25:15)
I think the go fast stuff is actually (25:13 - 25:16)
exciting so (25:15 - 25:20)
um we will be right back (25:16 - 25:20)
thank you (25:21 - 25:24)
[Music] (25:26 - 25:36)
and we are back from our break (25:33 - 25:38)
uh (25:36 - 25:40)
uh go Fest they release some details (25:38 - 25:43)
finally uh I another detail here that (25:40 - 25:46)
you might have forgotten is you can uh (25:43 - 25:48)
you can get your early bird special (25:46 - 25:50)
pricing until June 15th so that's that's (25:48 - 25:53)
coming up (25:50 - 25:53)
that's the last this week yeah so uh (25:54 - 25:59)
that's just I think you just saved five (25:57 - 26:00)
dollars I think it's like normally 30 (25:59 - 26:03)
early bird is 25 not to mention there's (26:00 - 26:05)
like the 75 worth of add-ons if you want (26:03 - 26:08)
that stuff yeah and I I'm pretty sure (26:05 - 26:11)
because I've done it for the T-shirt you (26:08 - 26:13)
can add the add-ons after buying the (26:11 - 26:14)
initial ticket (26:13 - 26:17)
getting the actual ticket the 25 or 30 (26:14 - 26:19)
dollars depending on when you buy it (26:17 - 26:21)
ticket is not very expensive it's the (26:19 - 26:24)
thing that kind of gets you in there all (26:21 - 26:26)
the additional costs including flights (26:24 - 26:31)
and hotels can be added after that so I (26:26 - 26:33)
kind of bought my ticket early because (26:31 - 26:36)
it wasn't that big of an investment (26:33 - 26:38)
before I could tell whether I was (26:36 - 26:41)
actually going to be able to go or not (26:38 - 26:41)
yeah um (26:42 - 26:47)
there's a (26:45 - 26:51)
there's three go fests locally and then (26:47 - 26:54)
there's uh the global one so there's a (26:51 - 26:55)
lot to cover we're not going to cover (26:54 - 26:58)
every single thing but (26:55 - 26:59)
um they they are they are breaking the (26:58 - 27:02)
go fast into biomes uh which they've (26:59 - 27:05)
done before I'm assuming (27:02 - 27:07)
the (27:05 - 27:09)
I don't know if they said this (27:07 - 27:11)
um but I'm assuming the in-person events (27:09 - 27:12)
the biomes will just be separated by (27:11 - 27:14)
physical locations because that's how it (27:12 - 27:17)
always has been very compass and then (27:14 - 27:19)
for the global it'll probably rotate on (27:17 - 27:22)
an hour basis (27:19 - 27:24)
um yeah like like it always has which (27:22 - 27:26)
which I think is fine I think both are (27:24 - 27:29)
great like I think in person being able (27:26 - 27:30)
to physically walk to the biome you want (27:29 - 27:33)
to walk to and and Hunt there is is is (27:30 - 27:34)
great (27:33 - 27:38)
um and I think Vegas uh I I know (27:34 - 27:40)
the media said Vegas was a complete (27:38 - 27:43)
disaster but the the when it did work (27:40 - 27:45)
which was after the first three hours of (27:43 - 27:49)
not working uh after those tragic three (27:45 - 27:51)
hours and it worked fine uh the biomes (27:49 - 27:53)
were really great and Niantic did a (27:51 - 27:55)
really great job at giving you a reason (27:53 - 27:57)
to explore the whole park and the whole (27:55 - 27:59)
biomes one of the things that I don't (27:57 - 28:01)
think Dante got enough credit for was (27:59 - 28:04)
um there were like eight pokestops in (28:01 - 28:07)
Vegas that were Spinda pokestops and so (28:04 - 28:08)
when you spun them you would get an (28:07 - 28:10)
encounter with Spinda but they scattered (28:08 - 28:11)
them all across the park so it really (28:10 - 28:13)
gave you a reason to be like oh I never (28:11 - 28:15)
went over here or like oh I'm missing (28:13 - 28:18)
Spinda number seven does anyone know (28:15 - 28:19)
where that is and they would be like oh (28:18 - 28:21)
it's over by the fountain like I've (28:19 - 28:22)
never been to the Fountain so like it (28:21 - 28:24)
was a really great (28:22 - 28:27)
way to get you to explore and then like (28:24 - 28:29)
once you were done exploring you could (28:27 - 28:31)
be like well I really want trap hinge so (28:29 - 28:32)
I'm gonna hang out in the desert and (28:31 - 28:34)
taste like sand all day (28:32 - 28:37)
because you're in (28:34 - 28:41)
okay you were in last year it's all sand (28:37 - 28:45)
I didn't really man leaving the Vegas (28:41 - 28:48)
thing each day and just like (28:45 - 28:51)
being caked in this thin layer of sand (28:48 - 28:53)
that like you got in the shower and (28:51 - 28:57)
you're like where is this coming from (28:53 - 28:57)
the air (28:58 - 29:02)
your mileage may vary depending if (29:00 - 29:04)
you're in London New York and London New (29:02 - 29:05)
York you'll just smell like trash when (29:04 - 29:07)
you get out (29:05 - 29:11)
yep New York is awesome because smells (29:07 - 29:14)
are vary from block to block you'll be (29:11 - 29:17)
like walking down the greatest smelling (29:14 - 29:18)
Street of all the food and turn the (29:17 - 29:21)
corner and hit garbage Central it is (29:18 - 29:23)
such a centrally overload walking (29:21 - 29:26)
through that City I love it um well we (29:23 - 29:28)
have an infographic here with the uh (29:26 - 29:30)
the worldwide stuff so I guess we'll do (29:28 - 29:33)
we'll do that because it's (29:30 - 29:36)
question (29:33 - 29:36)
why are they pushing carbon because (29:36 - 29:40)
something's going on (29:38 - 29:45)
who cares about carving who cares (29:40 - 29:48)
dancing related (29:45 - 29:48)
they just don't evolve into each other (29:49 - 29:54)
it's the same thing as like manaphy and (29:51 - 29:56)
fionae they both make Fiona eggs but (29:54 - 29:59)
fionae doesn't evolve into manaphy I (29:56 - 30:00)
think those might be a little more (29:59 - 30:03)
related they are a little bit more pink (30:00 - 30:04)
eggs it's the same thing as you know (30:03 - 30:07)
like uh you know plus of mine and (30:04 - 30:09)
Pikachu you know they're all mouses (30:07 - 30:11)
mices visas (30:09 - 30:14)
still not the same thing (30:11 - 30:14)
they're all well those are knockoffs (30:14 - 30:20)
so are we like excited to have a (30:17 - 30:21)
knockoff down I'm excited that there's (30:20 - 30:23)
something going on with carpet because I (30:21 - 30:25)
like carving and there's something going (30:23 - 30:27)
on with Carbink in both go and in (30:25 - 30:28)
scarlet and violet and I don't know what (30:27 - 30:30)
it is for sure well we kind of know what (30:28 - 30:32)
it is for go and at this point they're (30:30 - 30:35)
being very open that DNC is is (30:32 - 30:36)
the Pokemon you're getting at the end of (30:35 - 30:38)
it (30:36 - 30:40)
this is totally right like they they (30:38 - 30:42)
like said like Shaman is coming and all (30:40 - 30:44)
that stuff (30:42 - 30:46)
I'm sure they did but they also had (30:44 - 30:48)
Shaman's flower in the logo for the last (30:46 - 30:51)
one so that was also pretty clear yeah (30:48 - 30:54)
yeah it's it's it's a maybe like uh (30:51 - 30:57)
who's that Pokemon kind of thing (30:54 - 30:57)
this is like not like why are we (30:58 - 31:03)
surprised that carpink is here like did (31:01 - 31:05)
you not play a new Pokemon Snap like (31:03 - 31:08)
like was the car Bank not like the thing (31:05 - 31:09)
you took a picture of before darence (31:08 - 31:13)
they showed up I didn't get that far (31:09 - 31:13)
[Laughter] (31:15 - 31:18)
remember look I only got that game (31:16 - 31:19)
because they had to get a mouse on oh my (31:18 - 31:21)
gosh uh (31:19 - 31:24)
yeah you know (31:21 - 31:24)
go back in time here's here's some (31:27 - 31:30)
trivia (31:28 - 31:32)
the same category they're both known as (31:30 - 31:36)
the jewel Pokemon (31:32 - 31:36)
dience and Carbink are tied with the (31:36 - 31:40)
highest defense stat of all fairy (31:38 - 31:42)
Pokemon (31:40 - 31:42)
uh Diane's Origins as a mutilated car (31:42 - 31:48)
bank is reflected in a near identical (31:45 - 31:51)
move set and learn right uh learn rate (31:48 - 31:53)
through it it learns trick room instead (31:51 - 31:55)
of uh though it learns trick room (31:53 - 31:58)
instead of power gym engine six (31:55 - 31:58)
mutilated mutated mutated sorry yeah you (32:00 - 32:07)
know I'm mutilated and mutated there we (32:05 - 32:09)
go (32:07 - 32:12)
like difference (32:09 - 32:13)
mean (32:12 - 32:17)
one of them which one is it find out at (32:13 - 32:19)
the end of this episode (32:17 - 32:20)
hahaha (32:19 - 32:24)
so they're they're they are related but (32:20 - 32:26)
in the main Series games you can find (32:24 - 32:30)
carbank everywhere yeah yeah it's a it's (32:26 - 32:31)
a whole different situation than (32:30 - 32:34)
anything else and the fact that they are (32:31 - 32:37)
in both Pokemon go and in skull and (32:34 - 32:39)
violet kind of tying carbon so closely (32:37 - 32:41)
too Dancy and bringing it with all of (32:39 - 32:44)
these legendary and mythical Pokemon is (32:41 - 32:46)
different there's something I feel like (32:44 - 32:48)
there's something more there I I'm sure (32:46 - 32:50)
X and Y would have done it too except X (32:48 - 32:53)
and Y I had a too busy trying to tell an (32:50 - 32:55)
uncohesive story about a giant 3 000 (32:53 - 32:57)
year old man that was locked it up in (32:55 - 32:59)
jail and then a guy put on a virtual boy (32:57 - 33:01)
and tried to shoot a laser into the sky (32:59 - 33:03)
like (33:01 - 33:07)
all of all of that made more sense than (33:03 - 33:11)
the plot I agree with that (33:07 - 33:11)
I understand (33:11 - 33:18)
how a 3 000 year old man would be forced (33:14 - 33:20)
to be immortal for a mistake they made (33:18 - 33:22)
more than (33:20 - 33:27)
uh Rose not wanting to wait three hours (33:22 - 33:30)
to solve the energy problems of the (33:27 - 33:34)
world like come on ah no Sergeant shield (33:30 - 33:36)
made complete sense Rose wanting to (33:34 - 33:38)
solve the energy problems and can't wait (33:36 - 33:41)
for Leon to do one single battle pretty (33:38 - 33:44)
much explains every single American CEO (33:41 - 33:47)
that can't wait one single day I did (33:44 - 33:49)
hear one person like linking to a (33:47 - 33:51)
Wikipedia article for a term called (33:49 - 33:53)
long-termism and that made it make a (33:51 - 33:55)
little more sense (33:53 - 33:56)
but (33:55 - 33:58)
yeah I mean after the whole Twitter (33:56 - 34:00)
Fiasco Rosemary doesn't make a lot more (33:58 - 34:04)
sense but still (34:00 - 34:04)
I still fundamentally don't get the (34:04 - 34:11)
connection of how he was going to (34:08 - 34:15)
release eternitus to fix the energy (34:11 - 34:18)
problem that we then catch eternities so (34:15 - 34:20)
did we as Richard powerful people aren't (34:18 - 34:22)
always smart manufacturing we learned (34:20 - 34:24)
this from Blind Onion or whatever the (34:22 - 34:25)
knives out sequel is not learned it from (34:24 - 34:29)
but true but that made that point (34:25 - 34:29)
yeah class ending is amazing here's the (34:29 - 34:34)
question though and I still don't have (34:32 - 34:35)
an answer (34:34 - 34:38)
it was heavily applied the detergents (34:35 - 34:40)
was running their power we now have that (34:38 - 34:42)
just sitting in a Pokeball because we (34:40 - 34:44)
had to and they never sort of addressed (34:42 - 34:45)
what happens (34:44 - 34:48)
to all of the Power issues since we took (34:45 - 34:50)
their power plant away (34:48 - 34:52)
they're just like okay hey they would (34:50 - 34:55)
have figured it out after cool (34:52 - 34:57)
we're going back to car Cole we're gonna (34:55 - 35:00)
go burn these Pokemon and yeah you had (34:57 - 35:04)
to uh you had to illuminate one Mawile (35:00 - 35:06)
and two car banks at the entrance of the (35:04 - 35:08)
cave and then Diane say will come out of (35:06 - 35:10)
the crystals and then you have to uh (35:08 - 35:13)
illuminate her (35:10 - 35:17)
uh to do some fancy animations (35:13 - 35:19)
so Bud that logic is Mawile related too (35:17 - 35:22)
[Laughter] (35:19 - 35:25)
absolutely (35:22 - 35:25)
stabilizing carvings (35:26 - 35:33)
[Laughter] (35:29 - 35:33)
yeah get your lawyers that's why it's (35:33 - 35:36)
rare (35:35 - 35:39)
stabilize just digest carping small (35:36 - 35:41)
Wiles (35:39 - 35:43)
transforming all of this will make sense (35:41 - 35:45)
when Carbink and Diane say come to (35:43 - 35:47)
Pokemon Masters because it is the only (35:45 - 35:48)
game in this entire franchise that (35:47 - 35:52)
explains anything that has to do (35:48 - 35:54)
correct (35:52 - 35:57)
shout out two hammers writing the (35:54 - 35:59)
stories of Pokemon Masters because you (35:57 - 36:02)
actually have a degree in storytelling (35:59 - 36:04)
they do (36:02 - 36:06)
and they're trying to explain right now (36:04 - 36:08)
we're sort of trying to figure out the (36:06 - 36:10)
space time (36:08 - 36:13)
uh fund that they brought everybody from (36:10 - 36:16)
Hisui uh okay so if you buy a go fast (36:13 - 36:17)
worldwide ticket (36:16 - 36:19)
you'll be one of the first to encounter (36:17 - 36:20)
Carbink (36:19 - 36:23)
you will also get the time to research (36:20 - 36:26)
to complete diance so hopefully you'll (36:23 - 36:28)
see her in like seven years uh because (36:26 - 36:30)
they'll do something like fine five car (36:28 - 36:31)
bank and then they'll make the other (36:30 - 36:33)
four impossible and then you know you'll (36:31 - 36:36)
I'm still at like spin find five keckley (36:33 - 36:38)
out and I'm at like three or five right (36:36 - 36:41)
now it's (36:38 - 36:41)
I have to buy the global tickets yeah (36:41 - 36:44)
but I don't think there's a discounted (36:43 - 36:46)
price for that I think right but you do (36:44 - 36:49)
get more if you buy it sooner so if you (36:46 - 36:53)
buy the ticket below before July 5th (36:49 - 36:56)
I think (36:53 - 36:56)
you get the car Bank you'll get the car (36:56 - 37:03)
but regardless of that whenever you buy (37:00 - 37:05)
the ticket you also get access to (37:03 - 37:07)
special research for carbank during the (37:05 - 37:09)
event I believe (37:07 - 37:09)
um (37:10 - 37:14)
there will be four habitats rotating (37:12 - 37:17)
there's a quartz terrarium the pyrite (37:14 - 37:21)
Sands the Mac maculites malachite (37:17 - 37:25)
malachite Wilderness aquamarine Shores (37:21 - 37:27)
and they're showing four Pokemon for (37:25 - 37:29)
each but there will be more than four (37:27 - 37:30)
Pokemon (37:29 - 37:32)
um (37:30 - 37:36)
those are all stones (37:32 - 37:36)
cool for a worldwide event that uh (37:36 - 37:44)
Heracross is coming back so in the (37:42 - 37:46)
quartz terrarium you have Pikachu (37:44 - 37:50)
wearing a crown hair across shallos the (37:46 - 37:54)
blue one East sea and then benari and (37:50 - 37:56)
then the pyrite Sands you have Pikachu (37:54 - 37:59)
wearing a different Crown uh trap hinge (37:56 - 38:02)
Gibble and joltick in the wilderness you (37:59 - 38:04)
all have Pikachu wearing a different (38:02 - 38:08)
Crown uh Rose uh Rosalia (38:04 - 38:11)
and then (38:08 - 38:11)
is (38:13 - 38:16)
yeah we figured this out the other day (38:21 - 38:25)
in the slack (38:24 - 38:27)
um because it felt like it was originals (38:25 - 38:29)
but they're not no orangur has just been (38:27 - 38:30)
out for a while and pessimian's just (38:29 - 38:34)
nope missing he's just okay hanging out (38:30 - 38:36)
and then the aquamarine you have Pikachu (38:34 - 38:38)
wearing another crown (38:36 - 38:40)
these are all different crowns I think (38:38 - 38:41)
the little gem in the crown is different (38:40 - 38:43)
I think they're they're like little (38:41 - 38:45)
princess crowns or whatever yeah the (38:43 - 38:47)
gems and the crowns are different colors (38:45 - 38:49)
they look more like tiaras than crowns (38:47 - 38:50)
but (38:49 - 38:51)
you know I don't know the difference (38:50 - 38:53)
between a tiara I don't know the (38:51 - 38:55)
official difference they just look (38:53 - 38:57)
smaller and more dainty (38:55 - 39:01)
uh the aquamarine Shores has Pikachu uh (38:57 - 39:02)
Merrell (39:01 - 39:04)
Gumi (39:02 - 39:08)
and the West sea shellas and this will (39:04 - 39:12)
be gumi's shiny debut uh and will also (39:08 - 39:16)
be EC and West sea shalas's shiny debut (39:12 - 39:19)
it will be joltix (39:16 - 39:19)
and is getting shiny before pastimian (39:22 - 39:29)
even shows up yep (39:25 - 39:29)
all right for all of you heathens out (39:29 - 39:34)
there they do not know the difference (39:32 - 39:37)
between a crown and a tiara (39:34 - 39:37)
crowns are always full circle oh okay (39:38 - 39:45)
Tiaras are always semi-circle (39:42 - 39:48)
in the past crowns could be put upon (39:45 - 39:51)
both men and women and typically Tiaras (39:48 - 39:55)
were only for women that process has (39:51 - 39:58)
been disrupted thankfully so that's not (39:55 - 40:01)
the biggest that used to be like the (39:58 - 40:02)
what people always said were the (40:01 - 40:05)
difference the difference is Tiaras are (40:02 - 40:08)
always a half a semi-circle and crowns (40:05 - 40:10)
are always a full circle (40:08 - 40:12)
two models to determine for sure whether (40:10 - 40:16)
they're crowns or Tiaras (40:12 - 40:16)
well they also called the thing on a (40:19 - 40:25)
Lapras a scarf so yeah that's true (40:21 - 40:27)
that's interesting (40:25 - 40:31)
if you do the incense uh which (40:27 - 40:34)
this is like the secret scam of go Fest (40:31 - 40:36)
because you gotta buy a 15 ticket but (40:34 - 40:38)
then like in order to like optimize it (40:36 - 40:41)
you need to have incense running and you (40:38 - 40:43)
need to probably have a couple raid (40:41 - 40:45)
passes and you have like it's a really (40:43 - 40:47)
good scam like you can't just spend I (40:45 - 40:50)
mean you could just spend 15 and not pop (40:47 - 40:53)
an incense but I feel like you're really (40:50 - 40:55)
not getting the most out of your eight (40:53 - 40:58)
hour worldwide is it eight hours a day I (40:55 - 40:59)
think yeah (40:58 - 41:00)
and (40:59 - 41:03)
yeah look I am not giving them more (41:00 - 41:07)
money than I have to so (41:03 - 41:08)
yeah (41:07 - 41:11)
I'm sitting in a bunch of incestors (41:08 - 41:13)
yeah I have incense (41:11 - 41:17)
oh I still have premium raid passes that (41:13 - 41:19)
I'm sitting on uh but if you if you pop (41:17 - 41:21)
your incense during the the quartz (41:19 - 41:23)
terrarium you will get his sui and (41:21 - 41:26)
Growlithe spawns and then is for all of (41:23 - 41:28)
them for the record (41:26 - 41:31)
if you pop it for these Sands you get (41:28 - 41:32)
bishop or (41:31 - 41:35)
not Bishop Pawn here (41:32 - 41:37)
uh if you do it for the Wilderness you (41:35 - 41:39)
get carnivine and then if you do it for (41:37 - 41:41)
the shores you will get pacharisu (41:39 - 41:43)
they're really uh (41:41 - 41:46)
it feels like the quartz terrarium is (41:43 - 41:48)
the good one and the rest are like oh I (41:46 - 41:49)
don't know (41:48 - 41:51)
a carnivine and pachoriso are both kind (41:49 - 41:53)
of hard to get regionals (41:51 - 41:54)
yeah there's a lot of regionals here (41:53 - 41:57)
like carnivine and Pachirisu and (41:54 - 42:00)
terracraft but I feel like in other (41:57 - 42:03)
fests like I have gotten a bunch of (42:00 - 42:05)
batteries and a bunch of Carnival well (42:03 - 42:08)
they're from previous events that was (42:05 - 42:11)
the (42:08 - 42:11)
carnivine has not been on any Global (42:12 - 42:16)
event as far as I'm aware of yeah (42:14 - 42:18)
carnivine is just Florida and (42:16 - 42:20)
Georgia and I think like South Carolina (42:18 - 42:22)
Maybe (42:20 - 42:22)
I already went to Florida (42:25 - 42:29)
carnivine is probably the best thing (42:30 - 42:34)
coming out of Florida at this point (42:32 - 42:38)
yep yep just about yeah so I think (42:34 - 42:42)
carnivine was the special in Korea (42:38 - 42:45)
actually I think the Korean Safari Zone (42:42 - 42:47)
I think carnivine was the (42:45 - 42:50)
Pokemon there (42:47 - 42:53)
um pasharisu was (42:50 - 42:56)
some go Fest (42:53 - 42:59)
because I got a million of them and they (42:56 - 43:01)
were very in demand and I think I (42:59 - 43:03)
actually ran out in Korea because people (43:01 - 43:05)
kept asking me for Pachirisu and I was (43:03 - 43:08)
like oh yeah I have them until I got to (43:05 - 43:10)
a point where I was like oh I don't have (43:08 - 43:12)
them anymore for people who have never (43:10 - 43:14)
been to an in-person go Fest I think (43:12 - 43:17)
pachorisu is still pretty rare (43:14 - 43:18)
yeah because no one actually ever goes (43:17 - 43:20)
to Canada (43:18 - 43:22)
that's you know you have to go pretty (43:20 - 43:24)
far in to Canada I think to get a (43:22 - 43:26)
pacharisu yeah it's not right on the (43:24 - 43:28)
border yeah (43:26 - 43:30)
yeah and Canada's on fire right now so (43:28 - 43:33)
it's extra dangerous (43:30 - 43:33)
um (43:33 - 43:41)
the letters are a d i m n o with the (43:34 - 43:44)
debut of shiny unknown m (43:41 - 43:47)
M could D always be shiny I guess (43:44 - 43:50)
I don't know I don't know what when it (43:47 - 43:52)
would have debut shiny but uh it spells (43:50 - 43:53)
diamond (43:52 - 43:54)
for (43:53 - 43:57)
no it smells Andaman it's their (43:54 - 44:02)
introduction into Digimon true (43:57 - 44:02)
uh is I mean that that's the gist for (44:06 - 44:11)
the the biomes and the Pokemon (44:08 - 44:12)
obviously there will be more Pokemon (44:11 - 44:16)
than just the four we named who knows if (44:12 - 44:17)
it will be good or bad I mean if you (44:16 - 44:20)
look at the picture we're seeing uh the (44:17 - 44:23)
the Snorlax and Dragonite and brylum and (44:20 - 44:27)
true Mission golat and (44:23 - 44:31)
it's time Echo we all love chimecco (44:27 - 44:33)
um (44:31 - 44:33)
but this is I mean like a go Fest at (44:35 - 44:38)
this point is kind of established of (44:37 - 44:40)
what you're getting (44:38 - 44:42)
you're getting like four biomes (44:40 - 44:45)
it's a big complicated event with a lot (44:42 - 44:46)
of stuff (44:45 - 44:48)
okay so this is another chance for (44:46 - 44:51)
everybody who has way too many (44:48 - 44:53)
yep I will take out of your shiny (44:51 - 44:55)
Rosalia when you catch them on you're (44:53 - 44:57)
like I got 40 and I don't choose them I (44:55 - 44:58)
will take them all (44:57 - 45:03)
oh and for the global go festive t-shirt (44:58 - 45:06)
yeah uh for the global go Fest the shiny (45:03 - 45:08)
rates are only boosted if you buy the (45:06 - 45:10)
ticket but you can encounter the Pokemon (45:08 - 45:13)
if you do not buy the ticket (45:10 - 45:13)
except the incense doesn't work unless (45:15 - 45:20)
you buy the ticket yeah yes so the (45:17 - 45:21)
inside your intense will work but your (45:20 - 45:24)
incense will not attract like a known (45:21 - 45:27)
unless you have a ticket yeah (45:24 - 45:29)
yeah there we go (45:27 - 45:31)
and I have (45:29 - 45:33)
I like I'm already exhausted about (45:31 - 45:35)
people complaining about the shiny rate (45:33 - 45:38)
like we had this (45:35 - 45:42)
which go first was it Greg where we were (45:38 - 45:47)
at the Art Park and I was streaming (45:42 - 45:47)
last year was it last year's (45:48 - 45:54)
so that was what that was last year's (45:50 - 45:54)
that was when people were definitely (45:55 - 45:58)
complaining the shiny rate was nerfed (45:56 - 46:00)
for go Fest and then (45:58 - 46:02)
I talked to Niantic and they're like (46:00 - 46:04)
polygon talked to Niantic and then a (46:02 - 46:05)
bunch of other people talked to Niantic (46:04 - 46:06)
and they were like we don't talk about (46:05 - 46:08)
shiny rights but it was the same shining (46:06 - 46:10)
rate it's always been and then of course (46:08 - 46:12)
people didn't believe that because their (46:10 - 46:15)
RNG didn't line up with what it was the (46:12 - 46:16)
year before (46:15 - 46:19)
yep I kind of always just assume I have (46:16 - 46:21)
awful shiny luck and go from there so (46:19 - 46:24)
anytime I'm pleasantly surprised (46:21 - 46:25)
you know the thing I the thing that (46:24 - 46:28)
always stands out to me is like (46:25 - 46:31)
like I got I did get more shinies in the (46:28 - 46:32)
in person (46:31 - 46:34)
go Fest than I did in the worldwide go (46:32 - 46:37)
Fest but I also like played a lot harder (46:34 - 46:40)
and also (46:37 - 46:40)
I think part of it was the Art Park we (46:40 - 46:45)
went to Greg is like a really great (46:43 - 46:48)
place but it it doesn't have like 50 (46:45 - 46:52)
gyms right it has like six or seven gyms (46:48 - 46:54)
and it has (46:52 - 46:57)
yes in in a very small for the small (46:54 - 46:59)
location that it has and it has probably (46:57 - 47:02)
like maybe 20 pokestops but they're not (46:59 - 47:04)
like clustered together it's like it's (47:02 - 47:06)
like a minute to two minute walk between (47:04 - 47:08)
pokestop but if you go back to like you (47:06 - 47:11)
know German Germany's go fast like (47:08 - 47:13)
you're you can't walk without touching a (47:11 - 47:15)
pokestop like there's just (47:13 - 47:17)
it almost feels like there's double (47:15 - 47:19)
spawns so of course naturally if you're (47:17 - 47:20)
seeing twice the amount of Pokemon (47:19 - 47:22)
you're going to get more shiny it's just (47:20 - 47:24)
because there's there's just more things (47:22 - 47:26)
to tap on and click on in a in a shorter (47:24 - 47:28)
distance but the thing that always stood (47:26 - 47:30)
out to me is that the (47:28 - 47:31)
um (47:30 - 47:34)
the third go Fest because that was back (47:31 - 47:36)
in the first park because Niantic wanted (47:34 - 47:38)
to prove to everyone that they could do (47:36 - 47:39)
it (47:38 - 47:40)
um (47:39 - 47:43)
I remember being there for uh two hours (47:40 - 47:46)
and not getting a single shiny and I met (47:43 - 47:48)
up with somebody and in my time with (47:46 - 47:51)
walking with them they got four shinies (47:48 - 47:53)
and I was only walking with them for (47:51 - 47:55)
like 10 minutes and at the end of that (47:53 - 47:56)
day (47:55 - 47:59)
I ended up getting like (47:56 - 48:02)
five or six shinies at an in-person go (47:59 - 48:05)
Fest in in Chicago (48:02 - 48:07)
and everyone around me got like 20 20 (48:05 - 48:10)
like whatever and they I they had the (48:07 - 48:12)
audacity to be like (48:10 - 48:14)
well Steve are you tapping them and (48:12 - 48:17)
running away and then like yes I know (48:14 - 48:20)
how to play this video game that I've (48:17 - 48:23)
been covering since day one (48:20 - 48:30)
do you understand how RNG Works yup (48:23 - 48:30)
all about the luck (48:31 - 48:34)
so yeah I've I've been an in-person go (48:35 - 48:39)
Fest and I've had bad luck (48:37 - 48:41)
um (48:39 - 48:41)
and you know I've I've been in in-person (48:41 - 48:46)
go Fest and had a ton of luck like when (48:43 - 48:47)
I played the three days in Germany the (48:46 - 48:50)
first day I think I got like 25 shinies (48:47 - 48:53)
and then the third day I only got (48:50 - 48:56)
like nine and I was playing just as hard (48:53 - 49:00)
yeah last year last year at uh the (48:56 - 49:03)
global go Fest I was playing with uh two (49:00 - 49:05)
or so other friends I believe for most (49:03 - 49:07)
of it was just two other friends and we (49:05 - 49:09)
all played the same amount they all got (49:07 - 49:11)
I think somewhere between 8 and 12 (49:09 - 49:12)
shinies I got one (49:11 - 49:17)
it's just it's just how it goes (49:12 - 49:17)
I mean though it used to be in (49:20 - 49:26)
Minneapolis Victory Memorial (49:23 - 49:28)
had the (49:26 - 49:32)
German feel of you can't walk without (49:28 - 49:35)
running into a (49:32 - 49:40)
spin because so Victor Morrow Park has (49:35 - 49:42)
tombstones I mean it's a memorial (49:40 - 49:44)
and during the Ingress days Somebody (49:42 - 49:47)
went through and hit every Tombstone (49:44 - 49:50)
which is literally they're literally (49:47 - 49:52)
maybe a foot apart (49:50 - 49:57)
so in one Three Mile Stretch there were (49:52 - 50:01)
a hundred and fifty stops (49:57 - 50:03)
and like two gyms that was the problem (50:01 - 50:06)
with Victor there were no gyms there uh (50:03 - 50:07)
and then when Pokemon go got super (50:06 - 50:09)
popular everybody in the neighborhood (50:07 - 50:11)
complained (50:09 - 50:14)
um so Niantic has removed I think at (50:11 - 50:15)
this point because they just did another (50:14 - 50:17)
sweep I think they've removed like (50:15 - 50:19)
two-thirds of the stops that were in (50:17 - 50:23)
there so it is no longer (50:19 - 50:25)
great I think now (50:23 - 50:29)
Centennial Lakes is the better (50:25 - 50:30)
place (50:29 - 50:35)
for uh how things are laid out (50:30 - 50:35)
that a lot of people go to Art Park is (50:37 - 50:41)
is still great because they keep putting (50:39 - 50:43)
up art and you can just go look it's art (50:41 - 50:45)
yeah (50:43 - 50:48)
the best place it's just downtown yes a (50:45 - 50:50)
stretch a very thin Park downtown where (50:48 - 50:52)
you just walk back and forth (50:50 - 50:54)
it's fine it's not as nice as an art (50:52 - 50:56)
Park (50:54 - 50:57)
there is some art there right now though (50:56 - 51:01)
on the weekends when the skyways were (50:57 - 51:03)
opened all of downtown Minneapolis was (51:01 - 51:05)
great because you could walk indoors and (51:03 - 51:07)
every building you run into a Starbucks (51:05 - 51:09)
you're in all these places everybody had (51:07 - 51:13)
art uh so like downtown Minneapolis is a (51:09 - 51:14)
great place to walk around and there's a (51:13 - 51:16)
lot of stops but it used to be even (51:14 - 51:18)
better because it used to do it all (51:16 - 51:20)
indoors you cannot do that anymore and I (51:18 - 51:22)
have to deal with cars there are some (51:20 - 51:23)
bonuses for the global go Fest your (51:22 - 51:25)
lures will last (51:23 - 51:28)
um one hour instead of 30 minutes there (51:25 - 51:29)
will be exclusive field research that (51:28 - 51:31)
will give you Pokemon from different (51:29 - 51:33)
habitats there will be a snapshot and (51:31 - 51:35)
it'll be a surprise of who I'm assuming (51:33 - 51:37)
it's Pikachu or maybe it's car big (51:35 - 51:39)
probably I don't know car Banker Pikachu (51:37 - 51:40)
maybe (51:39 - 51:42)
um and then the remote raid pass limit (51:40 - 51:46)
will be increased to 20 a day (51:42 - 51:50)
instead of the five so if you would like (51:46 - 51:52)
to give Niantic forty dollars in raid (51:50 - 51:56)
pass money you are more than welcome to (51:52 - 51:58)
one is stopping you (51:56 - 52:00)
uh (51:58 - 52:02)
it doesn't I appreciate everybody who (52:00 - 52:05)
sends me remote rage requests I'm not (52:02 - 52:07)
giving them money so unfortunately I'm (52:05 - 52:11)
never going to accept a remote (52:07 - 52:13)
but very people people try with me (52:11 - 52:15)
anymore (52:13 - 52:15)
yeah I I don't I'm I don't I'm not no no (52:16 - 52:22)
not the same it's not gonna happen I (52:20 - 52:25)
think for me it depends (52:22 - 52:27)
if I get like I always kind of depended (52:25 - 52:30)
if I was like playing hardcore (52:27 - 52:32)
as in like I have Stardust on I have (52:30 - 52:35)
lucky egg on and then if somebody sent (52:32 - 52:37)
me a remote raid and it was at least a (52:35 - 52:38)
five star I'd be like (52:37 - 52:40)
well yeah because (52:38 - 52:44)
all my things are doubled at this point (52:40 - 52:46)
um and then obviously even better if I (52:44 - 52:48)
don't have the shiny (52:46 - 52:49)
um so I guess I still kind of play that (52:48 - 52:51)
way but (52:49 - 52:54)
before the change I was maybe only doing (52:51 - 52:57)
three remote rip maybe three or four (52:54 - 52:59)
remote raids a week (52:57 - 53:02)
um with the exception of like Deoxys I (52:59 - 53:04)
think Deoxys was like I'm I'm Sun cause (53:02 - 53:06)
fallacy I'm gonna keep doing it until I (53:04 - 53:07)
get it (53:06 - 53:10)
all right for me remote rates were just (53:07 - 53:11)
kind of (53:10 - 53:14)
if there was a new raid new Pokemon not (53:11 - 53:15)
even a new shiny if it was a new Pokemon (53:14 - 53:17)
that's what I would use the remote rates (53:15 - 53:18)
for (53:17 - 53:20)
I don't think you're alone I think (53:18 - 53:21)
that's I think that's a lot of people (53:20 - 53:23)
yeah (53:21 - 53:25)
um there are some bonuses if you have a (53:23 - 53:26)
ticket you have an increased shiny (53:25 - 53:28)
chance like Hannah said you'll have six (53:26 - 53:31)
special trades a day (53:28 - 53:32)
um I don't know if you need the ticket (53:31 - 53:33)
for that (53:32 - 53:35)
yes (53:33 - 53:37)
oh exclusive to take it home like this (53:35 - 53:39)
you do need the ticket for that okay so (53:37 - 53:41)
yeah I don't know how the six says (53:39 - 53:43)
bonuses (53:41 - 53:46)
the the six trades should still be okay (53:43 - 53:47)
if you're trading with somebody that (53:46 - 53:48)
doesn't have a ticket it's just they (53:47 - 53:51)
have one and you have five more to go (53:48 - 53:53)
um there will be the elite collector (53:51 - 53:55)
metal stuff that you can upgrade uh you (53:53 - 53:58)
will get nine free local raid passes by (53:55 - 54:00)
spinning the discs and then you will get (53:58 - 54:02)
seven special 7K eggs but I don't think (54:00 - 54:05)
they've said what's in eggs or raids yet (54:02 - 54:07)
right (54:05 - 54:07)
is the T-shirt design (54:07 - 54:12)
yeah so I don't I don't think there's (54:11 - 54:13)
anything about (54:12 - 54:17)
raids or eggs (54:13 - 54:17)
or what like the like uh there's no way (54:17 - 54:23)
goomy's done in like one star right oh (54:20 - 54:27)
yeah no that's you're almost definitely (54:23 - 54:27)
then next year there will be a community (54:29 - 54:32)
day (54:31 - 54:36)
correct in June probably yep (54:32 - 54:39)
yeah (54:36 - 54:40)
um yeah I think that's that's kind of (54:39 - 54:45)
the just for go Fest I mean they (54:40 - 54:47)
I I don't know if these details have (54:45 - 54:49)
convinced anyone to buy a ticket who (54:47 - 54:50)
hasn't already bought a ticket because (54:49 - 54:52)
you kind of know what you're already (54:50 - 54:55)
getting with go Fest (54:52 - 54:55)
but I don't maybe people are on the (54:56 - 55:01)
fence I'm not sure (54:58 - 55:03)
I don't know if this could be they have (55:01 - 55:05)
made events significantly less exciting (55:03 - 55:09)
in the past see uh hoe into her so it is (55:05 - 55:11)
nice to see that this is still a good (55:09 - 55:15)
exciting event that I think people are (55:11 - 55:18)
Owen is my favorite region the event was (55:15 - 55:20)
not as good as the previous two (55:18 - 55:22)
unless because the in-person event was (55:20 - 55:25)
better yeah yeah and the global event (55:22 - 55:26)
was much worse (55:25 - 55:28)
yeah (55:26 - 55:30)
but in this case it seems like the (55:28 - 55:31)
global go Fest is still going to be (55:30 - 55:32)
pretty good (55:31 - 55:35)
the ticket is going to add to it (55:32 - 55:37)
but there is still going to be a pretty (55:35 - 55:38)
good event even if you don't have a (55:37 - 55:41)
ticket I think that go Fest is not (55:38 - 55:43)
nerfed as some people were worried it (55:41 - 55:45)
was gonna be (55:43 - 55:45)
yeah yeah I think it's smart for an (55:46 - 55:50)
antic to continue the (55:48 - 55:55)
the in-person or the global stuff (55:50 - 55:55)
okay let's take one more break and then (55:55 - 55:59)
we'll finish up with the rest of the (55:57 - 56:04)
Pokemon news uh so we will be right back (55:59 - 56:04)
and we are back from our break (56:08 - 56:14)
all right we can Circle back to your (56:12 - 56:16)
Rayquaza shorts here (56:14 - 56:19)
uh first Pokemon Center (56:16 - 56:22)
this I I think this news is not like the (56:19 - 56:23)
most note (56:22 - 56:25)
like noteworthy but also at the same (56:23 - 56:27)
time they made a press release about it (56:25 - 56:29)
it did make a precious about it and it (56:27 - 56:32)
was in their email and I'm like (56:29 - 56:34)
so I was like usually they don't (56:32 - 56:36)
announce things ahead of time for (56:34 - 56:37)
Pokemon Center they just put stuff up (56:36 - 56:39)
and then it sells out and then people (56:37 - 56:42)
are like I missed it it's like a really (56:39 - 56:45)
cute like Pokemon gardening doormat and (56:42 - 56:47)
like their whole garden set went up and (56:45 - 56:48)
then the doormat sold out like instantly (56:47 - 56:50)
but they like never put a press release (56:48 - 56:53)
about that or they're just so it's (56:50 - 56:56)
interesting this is off pokemon.com July (56:53 - 56:59)

I guess so all right I guess I'm called (58:39 - 58:45)
out for that I'll take that (58:42 - 58:48)
so are you getting the D Rock infested (58:45 - 58:51)
no I think it had a third best I (58:48 - 58:52)
generally don't like dressing up as (58:51 - 58:54)
villainous teams (58:52 - 58:56)
depending on the Ville and his team of (58:54 - 58:58)
course but Team Rocket generally doesn't (58:56 - 59:00)
have things that I want to associate (58:58 - 59:03)
with there are some villainous teams (59:00 - 59:06)
that do but not this one (59:03 - 59:09)
it yeah I'm uh they haven't I also feel (59:06 - 59:11)
like when they have like these (59:09 - 59:14)
collaborations they say they're this is (59:11 - 59:16)
a street wear collection and there's (59:14 - 59:18)
three pieces (59:16 - 59:19)
um (59:18 - 59:21)
maybe it's not a collaboration maybe (59:19 - 59:23)
they just it doesn't seem like it (59:21 - 59:24)
doesn't seem like a collaboration (59:23 - 59:27)
upfront with it yeah it just seems like (59:24 - 59:29)
they're trying to (59:27 - 59:32)
really go all out (59:29 - 59:32)
but the Team Rocket stealing car Banks (59:34 - 59:38)
that's why they're so rare that's why (59:38 - 59:42)
they have to Market them as rare Pokemon (59:40 - 59:44)
yep (59:42 - 59:47)
we've cracked the code (59:44 - 59:47)
but they they there was just a (59:47 - 59:54)
um yeah zavi I was gonna say so zavi (59:50 - 59:56)
which is uh (59:54 - 59:59)
I I don't I (59:56 - 60:01)
they just sell like geeky merchandise I (59:59 - 60:03)
feel like they're like the the budget (60:01 - 60:07)
ThinkGeek like I just went to zavi (60:03 - 60:09)
z-a-v-v-i.com I just went to zombie (60:07 - 60:10)
right now Pokemon the Team Rocket thing (60:09 - 60:13)
is on their homepage (60:10 - 60:16)
and they have a Team Rocket collection (60:13 - 60:17)
they have shoes they have like a shirt (60:16 - 60:19)
with me out on it they have a hoodie (60:17 - 60:22)
but this is a different team rocket (60:19 - 60:24)
thing is yeah it is that's why it was a (60:22 - 60:26)
little confusing to me that the zavi (60:24 - 60:27)
collection has been up for about a month (60:26 - 60:29)
or two but now they're doing another (60:27 - 60:32)
team rocket thing on Pokemon Center (60:29 - 60:32)
so but like also nothing is (60:33 - 60:37)
corresponding with Team Rocket it's not (60:36 - 60:39)
like we're getting like let's go Pikachu (60:37 - 60:43)
two let's go Eevee to like like just (60:39 - 60:46)
there's just like nothing it's just more (60:43 - 60:47)
tanto (60:46 - 60:50)
yeah it's just it's it's just a little (60:47 - 60:52)
weird that (60:50 - 60:54)
there's like now two Team Rocket (60:52 - 60:56)
collections this year alone but there's (60:54 - 60:57)
no (60:56 - 60:59)
it's like no game to line it up with (60:57 - 61:02)
it's I mean I feel like I guess you (60:59 - 61:04)
could argue the shadow stuff in Pogo is (61:02 - 61:06)
like there's like some Shadow stuff has (61:04 - 61:08)
to feel like you know the end (61:06 - 61:12)
in uh saying goodbye to Team Rocket in (61:08 - 61:14)
the anime (61:12 - 61:17)
this is like Captain I mean that a (61:14 - 61:18)
little bit they lean into Team Rocket (61:17 - 61:21)
like they lean into gen one it's the one (61:18 - 61:25)
that represents all the rest yeah (61:21 - 61:27)
now maybe this was rainbow rocket (61:25 - 61:29)
instant sales but it's a regular rocket (61:27 - 61:34)
who cares there's 30 pieces Greg we (61:29 - 61:36)
haven't seen all 30 pieces if there's a (61:34 - 61:38)
rainbow rocket thing in there I may (61:36 - 61:41)
consider purchasing it (61:38 - 61:43)
they said oh I mean they said streetwear (61:41 - 61:44)
so like oversized shirts and stuff that (61:43 - 61:46)
makes sense I'm not I've never been on (61:44 - 61:48)
the oversized shirt (61:46 - 61:51)
phase I like this the slim fitted stuff (61:48 - 61:53)
but (61:51 - 61:53)
weird weird to like announce it though (61:53 - 61:59)
with a kind of a dressed up press (61:57 - 62:03)
release where every r capital r is (61:59 - 62:05)
highlighted in red someone definitely (62:03 - 62:07)
put the effort in (62:05 - 62:10)
yeah they they they sure did (62:07 - 62:11)
[Music] (62:10 - 62:12)
um (62:11 - 62:13)
Pokemon Center still has their (62:12 - 62:15)
collaboration with craft (62:13 - 62:18)
uh which is what like the (62:15 - 62:20)
one step away from being close to (62:18 - 62:24)
Lululemon when it comes to Fitness Gear (62:20 - 62:24)
I I don't know I I got the I got the (62:27 - 62:31)
craft hoodie (62:29 - 62:34)
and the craft jogging pants as a as a (62:31 - 62:38)
gift I don't remember what I I I feel (62:34 - 62:40)
bad now excellent hashtag ad I don't (62:38 - 62:42)
know what what collaboration I did but (62:40 - 62:44)
they they sent me they were like I'll (62:42 - 62:45)
pick some clothes out and I was like can (62:44 - 62:47)
I pick the craft and they're like yeah (62:45 - 62:50)
okay I'm gonna pick the craft they're (62:47 - 62:52)
okay I don't like love them they're (62:50 - 62:54)
they're nice I have a friend who got the (62:52 - 62:57)
Gardevoir Jack and really enjoyed it (62:54 - 63:00)
yeah (62:57 - 63:01)
yeah I would I would (63:00 - 63:04)
I guess my complaint is it's more (63:01 - 63:07)
Fitness over function like that it is (63:04 - 63:08)
very (63:07 - 63:10)
they got the fitness stuff right but man (63:08 - 63:12)
the pockets are bad on the joggers and (63:10 - 63:14)
the pockets are bad on the I'm not sure (63:12 - 63:17)
they got the fitness stuff right either (63:14 - 63:20)
it's definitely a style I'm not sure (63:17 - 63:22)
they hit it completely on the head (63:20 - 63:25)
but the crap if you go to like if you (63:22 - 63:27)
get cracked without Pokemon on it it is (63:25 - 63:29)
still expensive like like for for our (63:27 - 63:33)
listener the the craft Pikachu joggers (63:29 - 63:35)
here are ninety dollars this craft (63:33 - 63:36)
Pikachu (63:35 - 63:40)
Jersey is a hundred dollars yeah (63:36 - 63:43)
so it's not cheap by any means no well (63:40 - 63:45)
maybe also why do you need pockets on (63:43 - 63:48)
joggers you're just using them to jog (63:45 - 63:50)
if you want to you know put your Like (63:48 - 63:53)
Houses phone Keys phone (63:50 - 63:56)
you you not jogging without your phone (63:53 - 63:56)
I'm excited I'm focused on exercise not (63:58 - 64:04)
distractions never gone on a run with a (64:02 - 64:06)
Pokemon go Plus on your phone in your (64:04 - 64:08)
pocket and catching those Pokemon as (64:06 - 64:10)
you're running down the block (64:08 - 64:12)
heck no (64:10 - 64:15)
I am there for the pure adrenaline of (64:12 - 64:20)
exercising and taking care of my body (64:15 - 64:20)
I have a bunch of shorts that I just (64:20 - 64:25)
purchased that have no pockets (64:22 - 64:27)
which is a little unusual I was like oh (64:25 - 64:29)
they don't have any Pockets so I can't (64:27 - 64:31)
put I do carry my phone with me (64:29 - 64:33)
um (64:31 - 64:33)
I used to put my headphone into my (64:33 - 64:38)
pockets yeah (64:36 - 64:41)
they don't have any Pockets so I just (64:38 - 64:43)
carry them and I don't take my keys with (64:41 - 64:46)
me anymore because I why I can always (64:43 - 64:48)
get my husband's home he doesn't leave (64:46 - 64:49)
the house (64:48 - 64:52)
I just knock (64:49 - 64:52)
I don't know I I don't think I would uh (64:55 - 65:00)
I don't think I would I would buy any of (64:58 - 65:02)
the craft stuff with my own money (65:00 - 65:05)
they are good designs (65:02 - 65:07)
and I think a lot of them I have (65:05 - 65:11)
slightly better functionality than (65:07 - 65:15)
the other but they are way too expensive (65:11 - 65:16)
they're just yeah (65:15 - 65:18)
I really want the jersey that looks like (65:16 - 65:20)
it's straight out of The Hunger Games (65:18 - 65:24)
but I it's a hundred bucks (65:20 - 65:24)
I I saw somebody wearing a hoodie on (65:25 - 65:30)
like a tick tock I really liked and I (65:28 - 65:32)
reverse looked it up and I saw it was (65:30 - 65:34)
like Lululemon and I walked into (65:32 - 65:36)
Lululemon at mall America and I (65:34 - 65:39)
immediately walked out I found the (65:36 - 65:41)
hoodie it was a hundred and sixty (65:39 - 65:42)
dollars (65:41 - 65:45)
and I was like is it 160 at other (65:42 - 65:47)
locations (65:45 - 65:49)
do we wonder oh I don't know I mean mall (65:47 - 65:51)
America taxes (65:49 - 65:54)
five to ten dollars more cranks up them (65:51 - 65:56)
prices (65:54 - 65:56)
lululemon.com and I'm looking up hoodies (65:56 - 66:00)
okay (65:59 - 66:04)
[Laughter] (66:00 - 66:04)
um (66:05 - 66:08)
hoodies and sweatshirts oh I'm getting (66:06 - 66:11)
I'm narrowing in (66:08 - 66:13)
okay (66:11 - 66:15)
oh I don't it was it was great it kind (66:13 - 66:19)
of looked like it was like woven (66:15 - 66:19)
well they have a they have a gray City (66:19 - 66:24)
sweat pullover hoodie (66:21 - 66:27)
dollars (66:24 - 66:27)
on their website (66:27 - 66:33)
130 for a hoodie is still a lot yeah (66:29 - 66:36)
and this is all recognizing that (66:33 - 66:38)
the way that clothes are made they (66:36 - 66:39)
should probably be more expensive than (66:38 - 66:42)
they are but the way we all have money (66:39 - 66:45)
we don't have money for that in general (66:42 - 66:48)
it's just yes clothes should cost more (66:45 - 66:50)
but we all know that a lot of the times (66:48 - 66:52)
clothes do cost more that cost is not (66:50 - 66:54)
going (66:52 - 66:57)
I mean I used to work on retail and the (66:54 - 66:58)
standard retail markup on non-clothing (66:57 - 67:01)
is 400 percent (66:58 - 67:04)
so that's why when they are like 50 off (67:01 - 67:08)
it's still a 200 markup (67:04 - 67:12)
um so like it's weird because (67:08 - 67:15)
mostly it is quote on it you know the (67:12 - 67:17)
quote unquote markup it has nothing to (67:15 - 67:19)
do with the cost of making the coast and (67:17 - 67:20)
they could definitely pay everybody a (67:19 - 67:22)
lot more and still make the sale price (67:20 - 67:25)
but they mark it up so high so that they (67:22 - 67:27)
can always have things on sale and it (67:25 - 67:29)
always seems like a bargain and they're (67:27 - 67:31)
still making 200 percent (67:29 - 67:35)
what they paid for it (67:31 - 67:38)
uh if you if you watched any of the (67:35 - 67:40)
summer games coverage (67:38 - 67:42)
uh there was an IGN interview with like (67:40 - 67:45)
this new like switch attachment thing (67:42 - 67:48)
where you like put your switch into what (67:45 - 67:50)
looked like a dock and then it had its (67:48 - 67:52)
own controllers and stuff built in and (67:50 - 67:54)
the whole like gist of it was like you (67:52 - 67:56)
could change out the sticks and then (67:54 - 67:59)
like you know you like you could have (67:56 - 68:01)
like a taller stick like the little (67:59 - 68:04)
joystick or a shorter one or a wider one (68:01 - 68:07)
so like the controller housed your (68:04 - 68:08)
switch and it gave you better shoulder (68:07 - 68:10)
buttons and stuff it was really cool it (68:08 - 68:12)
was like a 60 product and they were (68:10 - 68:13)
showing it off in like an IGN interview (68:12 - 68:16)
and the guy from IGN was wearing a (68:13 - 68:19)
twelve hundred dollar shirt because we (68:16 - 68:21)
reversed looked that up and I was like (68:19 - 68:24)
maybe I should work at IGN they're (68:21 - 68:26)
clearly getting paid very well to be (68:24 - 68:28)
sitting in an interview with a 1200 (68:26 - 68:31)
t-shirt and or maybe that was just given (68:28 - 68:34)
to them but but I feel like I feel like (68:31 - 68:37)
I should be disclosed that that's an ad (68:34 - 68:40)
or something like that right I mean only (68:37 - 68:44)
you would look it up everyone's like oh (68:40 - 68:45)
my twitch chat looked it up because I (68:44 - 68:47)
was like man that's such a unique shirt (68:45 - 68:49)
like it it was like (68:47 - 68:51)
it wasn't just like a t-shirt it was (68:49 - 68:53)
like how it was like woven and they they (68:51 - 68:55)
looked it up and they found it very (68:53 - 68:56)
quickly (68:55 - 68:58)
um and I was like oh the person also (68:56 - 69:01)
could just be rich in working at IGN (68:58 - 69:02)
because they don't really need money (69:01 - 69:05)
that's true that's true it was a good (69:02 - 69:06)
interview and like the the shirt didn't (69:05 - 69:09)
mean the person was a terrible person (69:06 - 69:14)
added to the Ambiance yeah yeah (69:09 - 69:14)
um (69:14 - 69:18)
speaking of ambiance uh Chestnut it has (69:14 - 69:21)
some Ambiance maybe uh hey they fixed (69:18 - 69:23)
raids (69:21 - 69:25)
uh they said here the event was (69:23 - 69:27)
previously canceled due to errors the (69:25 - 69:29)
errors have been resolved so the event (69:27 - 69:31)
can be held again we apologize for the (69:29 - 69:33)
inconvenience it took them about 20 days (69:31 - 69:36)
to fix the raids uh chestnut with the (69:33 - 69:38)
mightiest Mark will return Friday June (69:36 - 69:43)
16th to Sunday June 18th UTC time just (69:38 - 69:44)
not came back not being encountered in (69:43 - 69:47)
paldea normally it will be Terror type (69:44 - 69:49)
Rock (69:47 - 69:51)
um (69:49 - 69:52)
you can only catch one if you've already (69:51 - 69:54)
caught a chestnut there's nothing (69:53 - 69:56)
different here you still can only catch (69:54 - 69:58)
one you can still do Chestnut raids if (69:56 - 69:59)
you want to (69:58 - 70:01)
um to get (69:59 - 70:04)
Terror shards or rare candy or (70:01 - 70:06)
whatever else it drops ability capsules (70:04 - 70:10)
bottle caps model caps so yeah you can (70:06 - 70:12)
you can still grind out Chestnut it's (70:10 - 70:15)
not terribly difficult raid uh because (70:12 - 70:17)
Chestnut doesn't reset its own stats it (70:15 - 70:19)
does reset your stats I think once or (70:17 - 70:21)
twice yeah but I would recommend (70:19 - 70:24)
bringing grass Pokemon I have I had a (70:21 - 70:26)
whole YouTube video up on this of (70:24 - 70:27)
different grass Pokemon you could bring (70:26 - 70:29)
they're all good they're all really (70:27 - 70:31)
great they all like Chestnut barely can (70:29 - 70:34)
do any damage to a grass Pokemon if you (70:31 - 70:35)
can only build one probably Appleton is (70:34 - 70:39)
is the way to go if you don't have a lot (70:35 - 70:40)
of time in your life give me the one (70:39 - 70:42)
Pokemon I should bring Ellie Appleton's (70:40 - 70:43)
really good (70:42 - 70:44)
um (70:43 - 70:46)
my video has the at the Appleton and (70:44 - 70:47)
everything (70:46 - 70:50)
I think that would be really fancy for (70:47 - 70:52)
Chestnut uh you can bring in your Arceus (70:50 - 70:53)
I don't know how many people have a (70:52 - 70:55)
spare Arceus you can give it a grass (70:53 - 70:56)
plate and you can give it like apple (70:55 - 70:59)
acid and just a grass move not Apple (70:56 - 71:01)
acid I'm sorry acid spray you can give (70:59 - 71:03)
it acid spray and then just like any (71:01 - 71:05)
grass type move and Arceus will be just (71:03 - 71:07)
fine as well if you want to be super (71:05 - 71:10)
fancy there uh great Tuscan iron Treads (71:07 - 71:13)
also returning so (71:10 - 71:15)
figured out (71:13 - 71:18)
a lot of people didn't even get a chance (71:15 - 71:19)
to do this because it lasted a solid (71:18 - 71:21)
like 10 minutes before they (71:19 - 71:23)
started Panic pulling (71:21 - 71:26)
uh it will also return Friday June 16th (71:23 - 71:28)
to Sunday June 18th these will be five (71:26 - 71:30)
star raids (71:28 - 71:32)
um (71:30 - 71:34)
they're not dropping anything too (71:32 - 71:36)
special but (71:34 - 71:39)
if if you didn't have people to trade (71:36 - 71:40)
with (71:39 - 71:42)
but you still have Nintendo online you (71:40 - 71:45)
can connect to the Poke portal and see (71:42 - 71:46)
the other raid and then join the other (71:45 - 71:47)
raid (71:46 - 71:51)
or you can do that invisible trick (71:47 - 71:54)
Co-op play Invisible and have another (71:51 - 71:58)
person spawn it in for you yep (71:54 - 71:58)
unsure that's (71:59 - 72:03)
oh that's a bug (72:01 - 72:03)
um (72:05 - 72:08)
but yeah those are coming back that's (72:06 - 72:10)
cool uh if if we if we look at the (72:08 - 72:12)
calendar (72:10 - 72:12)
um (72:12 - 72:15)
it would make sense for Delphi well (72:12 - 72:16)
Delphox was supposed to be next (72:15 - 72:18)
according to like Pokemon home (72:16 - 72:20)
um so it'd be it would make sense for (72:18 - 72:23)
Delphox to show up on the 23rd through (72:20 - 72:27)
the 25th and then show up again on the (72:23 - 72:29)
30th through the 2nd because the second (72:27 - 72:32)
weekend would be (72:29 - 72:35)
ni NAIC the Pokemon International (72:32 - 72:38)
championships so (72:35 - 72:41)
having Delphox repeat during an event (72:38 - 72:44)
but not having a debut when there is no (72:41 - 72:46)
event actually does make sense and lines (72:44 - 72:47)
up with the calendar I don't think (72:46 - 72:50)
they've ever had a seven star raid (72:47 - 72:51)
start (72:50 - 72:53)
like during a tournament weekend it's (72:51 - 72:55)
always like the tournament weekend's (72:53 - 72:58)
always the second time it comes around (72:55 - 73:00)
although I don't know I don't know if (72:58 - 73:03)
people care as much (73:00 - 73:05)
oh (73:03 - 73:07)
for Delphox and realaboom now that you (73:05 - 73:08)
could just move those in with Pokemon (73:07 - 73:12)
home like I I genuinely don't know how (73:08 - 73:13)
many people care about the mightiest (73:12 - 73:16)
Mark versus I just want to do this (73:13 - 73:18)
because I want this Pokemon (73:16 - 73:20)
because I can't get it because home is (73:18 - 73:22)
not there I just want it in a Pokeball (73:20 - 73:26)
that's not a Pokeball yeah (73:22 - 73:28)
I do them because I want them in luxury (73:26 - 73:31)
balls and it's like the only way to do (73:28 - 73:34)
starters that are not in a Pokeball (73:31 - 73:36)
since we don't have a Pokeball switch (73:34 - 73:38)
machine yet (73:36 - 73:38)
yeah and it was what's funny is I think (73:39 - 73:45)
I think everyone's speculated or guessed (73:43 - 73:48)
that Del Fox would have been fairy (73:45 - 73:49)
um and I think it's going to end up (73:48 - 73:52)
being fairy and it would have been (73:49 - 73:55)
probably the toughest Seven Star raid up (73:52 - 73:57)
to this point (73:55 - 73:59)
when I say the toughest you know raids (73:57 - 74:01)
will vary depending on your play style (73:59 - 74:03)
or if you're playing with people and (74:01 - 74:06)
stuff of course but (74:03 - 74:10)
um because if if it ended up being fairy (74:06 - 74:11)
um (74:10 - 74:15)
and it has psychic and fire as its (74:11 - 74:17)
primary type so fairy is weak to poison (74:15 - 74:19)
but because Delphox is psychic psychic (74:17 - 74:21)
is super effective and then fairies also (74:19 - 74:23)
weak to steal but since delphox's fire (74:21 - 74:26)
it covers both its weaknesses really (74:23 - 74:28)
well so that's actually why fairy makes (74:26 - 74:32)
sense it also gets fairy type moves (74:28 - 74:32)
but at least currently in scarlet and (74:32 - 74:36)
violet there wasn't a lot of really good (74:34 - 74:38)
Pokemon that countered that (74:36 - 74:41)
um the one that came to mind was stun (74:38 - 74:42)
tank (74:41 - 74:45)
uh but it doesn't hit super hard but (74:42 - 74:46)
yeah like it's still like an okay (74:45 - 74:48)
counter but the site the psychic can't (74:46 - 74:51)
hit it because it's dark (74:48 - 74:53)
um but now that Pokemon home is here we (74:51 - 74:55)
have really good counters we have like (74:53 - 74:58)
Dialga and Hisui and gudra like those (74:55 - 75:00)
two come to mind and like they're just (74:58 - 75:03)
they just they're just push over Delphox (75:00 - 75:04)
they're just they're just so good (75:03 - 75:07)
against all Fox so it's it's a little (75:04 - 75:10)
disappointing that (75:07 - 75:10)
we had like maybe a raid that was like (75:10 - 75:15)
could be super challenging I I guess it (75:12 - 75:16)
would be frustrating for randoms because (75:15 - 75:18)
probably randoms would struggle with it (75:16 - 75:19)
the most but now (75:18 - 75:22)
because now that home is here we have a (75:19 - 75:23)
lot of good counters for a potential (75:22 - 75:26)
fairy fire (75:23 - 75:27)
but (75:26 - 75:30)
at the same time I don't know who (75:27 - 75:31)
Maybe (75:30 - 75:34)
Delphox won't be that popular because (75:31 - 75:36)
you could already move your Fennekin in (75:34 - 75:38)
yeah it'll be interesting to see how (75:36 - 75:39)
much it changes up how many people will (75:38 - 75:41)
still be doing these raids now the home (75:39 - 75:42)
is connected (75:41 - 75:44)
but (75:42 - 75:46)
I do still reasons the Dell Fox was (75:44 - 75:47)
supposed to kind of line up with (75:46 - 75:51)
feminine King Community day too I think (75:47 - 75:53)
if there was not yeah just not issues (75:51 - 75:56)
and you look at kind of the the the (75:53 - 75:59)
speed they were doing (75:56 - 76:01)
whatever (75:59 - 76:03)
you know issues happen apparently they (76:01 - 76:05)
fixed them maybe they can fix the frame (76:03 - 76:07)
rate next (76:05 - 76:07)
uh before we wrap up uh Greg you just (76:08 - 76:13)
want to talk about Leafeon real quick (76:11 - 76:17)
yeah Olivia is here and unite uh lithian (76:13 - 76:20)
is a Speedster (76:17 - 76:22)
um some people are arguing that the (76:20 - 76:24)
ability to get to level four are (76:22 - 76:27)
overpowered uh I don't I don't know I (76:24 - 76:29)
think it's too early to say that it's (76:27 - 76:31)
overpowered I think levian is really (76:29 - 76:33)
good (76:31 - 76:37)
um but the fun thing is is if you manage (76:33 - 76:41)
to get all five EVS on a team (76:37 - 76:44)
the game says congratulations on your (76:41 - 76:46)
coordination and gives you a special (76:44 - 76:49)
splash page with fireworks (76:46 - 76:51)
oh that's cool all of the Eevee's (76:49 - 76:55)
in-game get a special Evie link boost so (76:51 - 76:58)
each one gets a unique increase like I (76:55 - 76:59)
think a brand gets a one percent (76:58 - 77:02)
increase to its HP like a competitive (76:59 - 77:05)
Advantage yeah tiny a tiny competitive (77:02 - 77:07)
advantage (77:05 - 77:10)
and then when an Eevee scores a point (77:07 - 77:13)
all the EVS say a little heart (77:10 - 77:16)
super cute that's really cool actually (77:13 - 77:18)
yeah it's really fun uh they did it (77:16 - 77:20)
really really well so there are now five (77:18 - 77:23)
EVS you can play a team of all five (77:20 - 77:26)
um it's interesting because (77:23 - 77:29)
Glaceon is St can I say on an SBN are (77:26 - 77:33)
still really super powerful in The Meta (77:29 - 77:34)
right now (77:33 - 77:36)
um and so like (77:34 - 77:39)
a lot of people are playing those and (77:36 - 77:43)
while Umbreon isn't the best defender it (77:39 - 77:47)
is a solid Defender so playing a team of (77:43 - 77:51)
all five EVS is actually a pretty decent (77:47 - 77:53)
configuration the other thing you're (77:51 - 77:55)
missing is support (77:53 - 77:57)
um but the season just reset so people (77:55 - 77:59)
don't understand how to do like the (77:57 - 78:01)
season reset today so if you want to (77:59 - 78:03)
jump into unite at the start of the (78:01 - 78:05)
Season it reset today (78:03 - 78:08)
um so AKA wait a week for all the right (78:05 - 78:11)
try hard people are gonna go up (78:08 - 78:15)
um but uh Leafeon is really is a really (78:11 - 78:16)
good speeder Speedster it's passive (78:15 - 78:19)
chlorophyll means that it runs faster (78:16 - 78:22)
that's the Speedster part of it so it (78:19 - 78:24)
can move in really fast all of its (78:22 - 78:25)
movesets are really good some people are (78:24 - 78:28)
arguing that it's a solar blade is (78:25 - 78:31)
overpowered to get at four because it (78:28 - 78:33)
does do a lot of damage (78:31 - 78:35)
um but I've also like every time I've (78:33 - 78:38)
been in battles with Leafeon that thing (78:35 - 78:41)
dies in an instant like if anybody gangs (78:38 - 78:44)
up on it it's just shredded paper (78:41 - 78:46)
um and the weird thing is is it does (78:44 - 78:48)
have to get close because it's a (78:46 - 78:49)
physical attacker and not a special (78:48 - 78:51)
attacker (78:49 - 78:52)
um so I don't (78:51 - 78:54)
I don't necessarily buy that it's (78:52 - 78:56)
overpowered right now but I think it is (78:54 - 79:00)
rightly powered for where the meta is at (78:56 - 79:04)
but uh go play try to get a team of all (79:00 - 79:08)
five EVS it's super cute cool (79:04 - 79:08)
uh well I think that's our show uh we (79:08 - 79:13)
will be back next week (79:10 - 79:14)
uh (79:13 - 79:17)
and I guess we'll uh we'll have an (79:14 - 79:18)
update on (79:17 - 79:19)
Chestnut I don't think anything will (79:18 - 79:21)
change but maybe there's something cool (79:19 - 79:24)
about the great Tusk iron Treads I doubt (79:21 - 79:26)
it but (79:24 - 79:29)
uh we'll see I guess and I they didn't (79:26 - 79:31)
say when the Team Rocket collection is (79:29 - 79:32)
coming on Pokemon Center which is a bit (79:31 - 79:33)
of a bummer but (79:32 - 79:35)
um I'd be curious of what those 30 (79:33 - 79:37)
pieces look like that's a lot of stuff (79:35 - 79:40)
yeah that's a big collection (79:37 - 79:40)
very nice it had a banner on it and I (79:41 - 79:46)
think I said it's coming within a week (79:44 - 79:49)
okay (79:46 - 79:49)
they have like a promo on Pokemon Center (79:55 - 79:58)
right now where if you order a bag you (79:56 - 80:01)
get um (79:58 - 80:01)
here's another bag (80:02 - 80:08)
you get a bag for your bag it's like a (80:05 - 80:09)
grocery bag it's like a reusable grocery (80:08 - 80:12)
bag yeah yeah yeah (80:09 - 80:14)
I always forget to put them in my car so (80:12 - 80:16)
it's like I get there I'm like I forget (80:14 - 80:18)
my I have a tiny one I have a teeny tiny (80:16 - 80:20)
one that I just keep attached to my keys (80:18 - 80:23)
it's great oh that's cool (80:20 - 80:26)
um anyways thank you for listening uh if (80:23 - 80:29)
you use uh tell us in the comments on (80:26 - 80:31)
YouTube your favorite reusable grocery (80:29 - 80:34)
bag and uh (80:31 - 80:34)
hey uh Greg you uh launched a (80:34 - 80:40)
Kickstarter I did I launched my second (80:37 - 80:43)
uh tabletop role-playing game based off (80:40 - 80:45)
of the wonderful Scooby-Doo cartoons (80:43 - 80:48)
it's called the mystery business uh it's (80:45 - 80:50)
on Kickstarter live right now uh go (80:48 - 80:53)
there learn all about how the game is (80:50 - 80:56)
played uh it's been super fun in all the (80:53 - 80:59)
play tests uh so I'm hoping that it will (80:56 - 81:02)
get funded it's going for 30 days it (80:59 - 81:04)
ends on July (81:02 - 81:06)
fifth (81:04 - 81:09)
uh we'll have the link in the show notes (81:06 - 81:11)
because I don't think there's a that's (81:09 - 81:13)
correct wants to read off the attack (81:11 - 81:18)
on your car go to Kickstarter search the (81:13 - 81:20)
mystery business and you will find it (81:18 - 81:23)
kickstarter's search engine is so bad it (81:20 - 81:24)
is horrible you have to like know it (81:23 - 81:28)
exactly and that is it exactly the (81:24 - 81:30)
mystery business although I did get it (81:28 - 81:32)
to work by just doing mystery business (81:30 - 81:33)
because (81:32 - 81:35)
it's the only one called that which is (81:33 - 81:36)
why I picked that name because it's (81:35 - 81:38)
literally nowhere else (81:36 - 81:41)
good SEO yeah (81:38 - 81:43)
uh all right thank you Hannah thank you (81:41 - 81:45)
Greg we will be back next week this has (81:43 - 81:46)
been another episode of the Pokemon (81:45 - 81:50)
podcast and we are super effective going (81:46 - 81:52)
to Kickstarter to check out the mystery (81:50 - 81:54)
business instead of playing Pokemon TCG (81:52 - 81:56)
live because one sounds like a (81:54 - 81:57)
significantly better tabletop experience (81:56 - 82:02)
than the other super mine works (81:57 - 82:02)
[Music] (82:03 - 82:14)
thank you (82:12 - 82:27)
