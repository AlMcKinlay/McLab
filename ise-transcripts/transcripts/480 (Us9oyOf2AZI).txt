that's called that's how you balance the (3:26 - 3:31)
game yeah exactly (3:28 - 3:33)
at least they like slightly made (3:31 - 3:35)
greninja not as strong because greninja (3:33 - 3:37)
was very dominant (3:35 - 3:40)
i mean it still is (3:37 - 3:42)
but that's before (3:40 - 3:44)
mammo swine came ah we don't know if (3:42 - 3:47)
it's an all-arounder or a defender or (3:44 - 3:48)
it's moves i mean it looks like it has (3:47 - 3:50)
isoco crash if you watch the little (3:48 - 3:52)
trailer um but everybody's saying that (3:50 - 3:54)
it's a defender which i'm like i don't (3:52 - 3:56)
know i think they're getting it because (3:54 - 3:58)
of the banner color (3:56 - 4:00)
but uh because it's big too yeah it's (3:58 - 4:03)
also because it's big but that that is (4:00 - 4:05)
sizeist and i'm not here for it i want (4:03 - 4:06)
it to be an all-around color where are (4:05 - 4:09)
they seeing this banner color in on (4:06 - 4:10)
twitter (4:09 - 4:12)
when it hold on (4:10 - 4:16)
because it just it's just the yellow (4:12 - 4:20)
the purple on top and bottom (4:16 - 4:20)
uh (4:22 - 4:26)
just like (4:23 - 4:27)
here's the hot take i'll send you the (4:26 - 4:29)
thing hold on there's a lot of hot takes (4:27 - 4:30)
in unite number one i got a lot of them (4:29 - 4:33)
number one is your role literally (4:30 - 4:35)
doesn't matter that's why no one that's (4:33 - 4:37)
why no one is using speedsters in the (4:35 - 4:39)
jungle speedster is supposed to be the (4:37 - 4:41)
jungle but your people are putting ralts (4:39 - 4:43)
it's chaos it's wild times out there (4:41 - 4:45)
greninja cinderace (4:43 - 4:47)
what was the one that happened to me (4:45 - 4:49)
yesterday slowpoke i had i had jungle (4:47 - 4:51)
poke yesterday (4:49 - 4:54)
i wasn't trying to great it wasn't bad i (4:51 - 4:56)
had a jungle mister mom one time and he (4:54 - 4:58)
dominated the entire game (4:56 - 5:00)
it was really it was really scary (4:58 - 5:02)
actually (5:00 - 5:03)
it is (5:02 - 5:04)
i (5:03 - 5:05)
i (5:04 - 5:07)
keep thinking the roles are going to (5:05 - 5:09)
matter more the only one that matters is (5:07 - 5:10)
if you're actually trying to play (5:09 - 5:12)
support as support because literally (5:10 - 5:14)
everybody just murders you (5:12 - 5:16)
i've stopped playing elder goss to try (5:14 - 5:18)
to climb the ladder because (5:16 - 5:21)
i was tired of literally being locked on (5:18 - 5:23)
by everything the minute i showed up you (5:21 - 5:25)
know what's funny is i i was going (5:23 - 5:26)
through the top players in the (5:25 - 5:28)
leaderboard (5:26 - 5:29)
and they almost all were playing elder (5:28 - 5:30)
goss (5:29 - 5:32)
it was kind of it was kind of yeah once (5:30 - 5:34)
you get into masters and you can't lose (5:32 - 5:35)
switch back have fun with the character (5:34 - 5:38)
you want but on the grind heck no i am (5:35 - 5:42)
literally i'll go to a go down and pop (5:38 - 5:44)
one bit out of my base and a swarm of (5:42 - 5:46)
things are like there it is (5:44 - 5:49)
murder the healer (5:46 - 5:51)
yeah um (5:49 - 5:51)
i like unite so much but it is (5:52 - 6:00)
it has so many little things that add up (5:57 - 6:01)
it's probably how people feel about (6:00 - 6:04)
pokemon go yep like (6:01 - 6:06)
and they're (6:04 - 6:08)
they're real they've been pretty good at (6:06 - 6:10)
communicating but also there's like this (6:08 - 6:12)
blind spot of (6:10 - 6:15)
it's not that big of a deal but (6:12 - 6:17)
everyone thought season one was gonna (6:15 - 6:18)
end (6:17 - 6:19)
yes (6:18 - 6:22)
and it didn't end and they rolled out (6:19 - 6:24)
another battle pass but the battle pass (6:22 - 6:26)
says season two but the rank is still (6:24 - 6:29)
season one season one and i don't (6:26 - 6:31)
understand and so as of this recording (6:29 - 6:36)
there is still no end date to season one (6:31 - 6:38)
but if you go back and read earlier (6:36 - 6:41)
press things it said that the first (6:38 - 6:43)
season it was it said like it said (6:41 - 6:44)
something like the first half of the (6:43 - 6:45)
season (6:44 - 6:46)
yeah (6:45 - 6:49)
so i guess this is the second half but (6:46 - 6:50)
also there's no countdown saying when (6:49 - 6:52)
season one is going to end which is a (6:50 - 6:54)
little confusing yeah (6:52 - 6:56)
well just count the days and then double (6:54 - 6:59)
them and then that's it yeah then (6:56 - 7:02)
but season one was 60 days and season (6:59 - 7:04)
two is only 44 or (7:02 - 7:06)
the season (7:04 - 7:08)
the battle pass is different this is (7:06 - 7:10)
just like the currencies (7:08 - 7:13)
gems and and minerals and whatever's are (7:10 - 7:15)
different so season battle passes and (7:13 - 7:17)
seasons are two different things (7:15 - 7:19)
so many (7:17 - 7:21)
tickets to get fashion items because (7:19 - 7:23)
i've gotten duplicates and the only (7:21 - 7:25)
thing i can spend tickets on (7:23 - 7:27)
are the things that i have that i got (7:25 - 7:29)
the tickets for duplicates they need to (7:27 - 7:31)
fill out (7:29 - 7:33)
they did add a lot to the store this (7:31 - 7:35)
second seas (7:33 - 7:37)
i'm talking about the tickets like when (7:35 - 7:39)
you get when you do the loot crate thing (7:37 - 7:40)
and you get a duplicate that says hey (7:39 - 7:44)
you get 15 fashion tickets and you can (7:40 - 7:47)
only spend them in that fashion ticket (7:44 - 7:49)
box i have everything in there you have (7:47 - 7:51)
the guard shop (7:49 - 7:53)
that's not a fashion ticket that's a (7:51 - 7:56)
hollow wear oh okay i see i say i say i (7:53 - 7:59)
see the things that i get to wear my (7:56 - 8:00)
clothes you're going to update more (7:59 - 8:03)
because i keep getting all these tickets (8:00 - 8:05)
and i can't spend them on anything did (8:03 - 8:07)
um (8:05 - 8:09)
did you guys look at the season 2 battle (8:07 - 8:11)
pass yes it's (8:09 - 8:14)
so first off the gengar skin is super (8:11 - 8:16)
cool yes very cute correct the lucario (8:14 - 8:19)
skin is not super cool i was like is (8:16 - 8:22)
this even a skin what is this you're (8:19 - 8:24)
wearing a nasa jacket or something yeah (8:22 - 8:26)
sure nasa jackets (8:24 - 8:28)
that makes me think of space they (8:26 - 8:30)
release that we're getting uh (8:28 - 8:33)
alolan nine tails hollower (8:30 - 8:34)
but yeah they don't show it anywhere (8:33 - 8:36)
they don't show it well they showed the (8:34 - 8:39)
pokemon unite twitter showed the (8:36 - 8:42)
um the trailer for it and it's very very (8:39 - 8:43)
cute (8:42 - 8:45)
i thought (8:43 - 8:48)
in all honesty (8:45 - 8:48)
because i hadn't downloaded the game but (8:49 - 8:53)
i saw the gengar suit and the other (8:50 - 8:54)
space suit i thought oh they're (8:53 - 8:58)
releasing a space map with this update (8:54 - 9:01)
agreed thought the same thing changed (8:58 - 9:03)
so the other thing is they changed like (9:01 - 9:05)
all the menus and they changed the (9:03 - 9:07)
loading for the better and they changed (9:05 - 9:10)
like not the map but um like icons on (9:07 - 9:12)
the map right (9:10 - 9:13)
and they added more announcer voices (9:12 - 9:16)
they did a lot yeah fix the interface i (9:13 - 9:18)
haven't done the announcements because i (9:16 - 9:20)
still have it turned off (9:18 - 9:23)
because oh (9:20 - 9:23)
so i thought there was going to be a (9:31 - 9:34)
space station thing which there wasn't (9:32 - 9:38)
the new menu is so much better the menus (9:34 - 9:39)
are spacey though they're like hollow (9:38 - 9:41)
gray yeah like yeah (9:39 - 9:43)
are they are they always (9:41 - 9:45)
no no no no they're definitely more (9:43 - 9:46)
spacey now i wonder if they change it (9:45 - 9:49)
after the season i have an issue (9:46 - 9:52)
with and that i can't so you know how (9:49 - 9:54)
you get a little red dot under events (9:52 - 9:56)
saying hey you have something to collect (9:54 - 9:57)
yeah (9:56 - 9:58)
i have a red dot (9:57 - 10:01)
and nothing to collect i have gone (9:58 - 10:02)
through that menu (10:01 - 10:04)
it's the stickers (10:02 - 10:05)
no (10:04 - 10:08)
did you check your actual profile yes (10:05 - 10:12)
did you get your fair play coins yes (10:08 - 10:14)
but the events box the one the box that (10:12 - 10:17)
says events has a red dot did you get (10:14 - 10:19)
your pikachu on mobile (10:17 - 10:20)
yes (10:19 - 10:22)
because that was that was broken for a (10:20 - 10:22)
bit (10:22 - 10:25)
so i have i don't know (10:22 - 10:28)
what is what i'm missing i have checked (10:25 - 10:29)
literally everything and there's still a (10:28 - 10:32)
red dot and i cannot find it it's the (10:29 - 10:34)
stickers (10:32 - 10:35)
it's not the stickers because i went (10:34 - 10:36)
through all the stickers and they turned (10:35 - 10:38)
them off and it turned the red dot off (10:36 - 10:41)
i going back to the the buffs and the (10:38 - 10:43)
nerfs i remember because i make these (10:41 - 10:45)
graphics where it just it has plus (10:43 - 10:46)
arrows or down arrows it's just really (10:45 - 10:48)
easy for people to like take a glance (10:46 - 10:51)
and i remember when um the first balance (10:48 - 10:53)
big big balance update sarah aura had (10:51 - 10:56)
plus arrows and everyone like (10:53 - 10:57)
not everyone but a lot of comments were (10:56 - 10:58)
like i can't believe they're buffing (10:57 - 11:00)
sarah orr and it's like no they're (10:58 - 11:01)
buffing (11:00 - 11:03)
well yes they are buffing zero but (11:01 - 11:05)
they're buffing the two moves no one has (11:03 - 11:07)
ever used on zera aura (11:05 - 11:09)
um (11:07 - 11:10)
because they've never buffed discharge (11:09 - 11:13)
and i've never seen a zero aura player (11:10 - 11:16)
not run discharge discharge is just so (11:13 - 11:18)
incredibly good i've never seen anybody (11:16 - 11:19)
they've never nerfed discharged but (11:18 - 11:20)
they've never buffed it they've always (11:19 - 11:22)
buffed zera aura's other moves (11:20 - 11:23)
um (11:22 - 11:25)
and so when i see like certain moves get (11:23 - 11:27)
buffed i'm like oh like venusaur like no (11:25 - 11:30)
one's running pedal dance so they buffed (11:27 - 11:32)
it yeah i get it no one's running dive (11:30 - 11:33)
on camera and so they buffed it again (11:32 - 11:35)
everyone's running why would you run (11:33 - 11:37)
dive surf is just significantly better (11:35 - 11:39)
and (11:37 - 11:40)
then i looked at cinderace this last (11:39 - 11:42)
week (11:40 - 11:44)
and it and they buffed blaze kick and i (11:42 - 11:47)
don't think most people run blaze kick (11:44 - 11:49)
um i think people run faint instead yeah (11:47 - 11:51)
fainter sort of dodge literally (11:49 - 11:53)
everything you try to do (11:51 - 11:55)
and then (11:53 - 11:57)
they buff pyroball which i thought was (11:55 - 11:58)
already (11:57 - 12:01)
pretty good and now it's like (11:58 - 12:04)
even more good i don't know it just (12:01 - 12:06)
cinderease feel already like if i was to (12:04 - 12:08)
go into this last update of like the top (12:06 - 12:09)
three strongest pokemon it would have (12:08 - 12:12)
been greninja cinder ace and blastoise (12:09 - 12:12)
yep (12:12 - 12:15)
and blastoise didn't get any changes (12:12 - 12:17)
except he was bugged (12:15 - 12:18)
where (12:17 - 12:21)
the rapid spin would slow you down you (12:18 - 12:23)
as like if you're facing blast toys and (12:21 - 12:25)
it wasn't supposed to slow you down and (12:23 - 12:27)
then rapid spin would let you like (12:25 - 12:29)
attack while in rapid spin which wasn't (12:27 - 12:31)
supposed to happen yeah (12:29 - 12:32)
i get it where are you supposed to hydro (12:31 - 12:33)
pump while you were you know if you're (12:32 - 12:36)
supposed to hydrate (12:33 - 12:39)
without doing rapid spin which is fine (12:36 - 12:41)
i do get that he's like there there's (12:39 - 12:43)
part of me and i don't know if like (12:41 - 12:45)
league or dota have ever admitted this i (12:43 - 12:47)
probably will never admit it like if a (12:45 - 12:48)
character is (12:47 - 12:51)
overpowered it's probably selling more (12:48 - 12:53)
and they probably don't want to nerf it (12:51 - 12:55)
because it would stop the sales (12:53 - 12:57)
of said character yeah they won't nerf (12:55 - 12:59)
it until the new character comes out so (12:57 - 13:01)
i expect changes after mama swine comes (12:59 - 13:03)
out (13:01 - 13:06)
because there's because (13:03 - 13:08)
giving a new character gives them a good (13:06 - 13:10)
excuse to rebalance everything because (13:08 - 13:12)
they've added a new element (13:10 - 13:13)
so (13:12 - 13:16)
it's an easy way to say oh here's a new (13:13 - 13:17)
character and now we're going to make (13:16 - 13:19)
all these changes to (13:17 - 13:21)
compensate for this new gameplay when (13:19 - 13:22)
it's really like we should have been (13:21 - 13:24)
fixing this all along but people aren't (13:22 - 13:25)
buying blastoises anymore they're going (13:24 - 13:28)
to buy mammoth sign which i am going to (13:25 - 13:29)
do (13:28 - 13:31)
uh did you guys buy the battle pass (13:29 - 13:33)
season yes i didn't buy the battle pass (13:31 - 13:35)
season one no (13:33 - 13:37)
hey you can get a kilt outfit it's very (13:35 - 13:40)
kilty there's only two socks in this (13:37 - 13:43)
battle pass yeah yeah absolutely no yeah (13:40 - 13:45)
first battle pass had like (13:43 - 13:49)
at least 20. (13:45 - 13:49)
my second hot take on unite before we (13:51 - 13:54)
move on (13:53 - 13:55)
okay (13:54 - 13:56)
is (13:55 - 13:58)
i see a lot of people in our discord or (13:56 - 14:00)
slack or the twitch stream that come (13:58 - 14:02)
through and they're like man i just (14:00 - 14:04)
can't wait to get to veteran or i can't (14:02 - 14:07)
get way to get to ultra i have made it (14:04 - 14:08)
to master (14:07 - 14:10)
and what i can tell you (14:08 - 14:13)
confidently (14:10 - 14:16)
by getting to master in solo queue (14:13 - 14:17)
is (14:16 - 14:21)
the ranking system in unite (14:17 - 14:23)
genuinely doesn't matter (14:21 - 14:24)
it is (14:23 - 14:29)
the the people you play with in ultra (14:24 - 14:31)
are not any better than people you play (14:29 - 14:33)
with in veteran the people you play with (14:31 - 14:35)
in veteran are not any better than (14:33 - 14:37)
master i promise you this (14:35 - 14:40)
and if anything that i have learned in (14:37 - 14:43)
the last 60 days of playing this game (14:40 - 14:45)
i would rather play with anyone who are (14:43 - 14:48)
who is not in master rank because master (14:45 - 14:51)
rank people have nothing to lose yeah (14:48 - 14:54)
once you get to master rank you you (14:51 - 14:55)
don't you don't have to worry about that (14:54 - 14:58)
crystal system anymore your number goes (14:55 - 14:59)
down and it doesn't matter you will stay (14:58 - 15:02)
master for the rest of the season like (14:59 - 15:03)
that number is so irrelevant because no (15:02 - 15:06)
one sees it but you (15:03 - 15:07)
and you will still be considered a (15:06 - 15:09)
master even if you lose 30 games in a (15:07 - 15:11)
row and master they just they don't the (15:09 - 15:14)
thing is they don't care those players (15:11 - 15:15)
and masters (15:14 - 15:16)
like the (15:15 - 15:18)
we we're losing before dreadnaught throw (15:16 - 15:20)
the game which i get like people do that (15:18 - 15:22)
very early in the thing but right but (15:20 - 15:23)
they'll just walk away from their (15:22 - 15:26)
controller like oh yeah is then why are (15:23 - 15:28)
they even playing i already have no (15:26 - 15:31)
clue but here's the thing i am excited (15:28 - 15:34)
to get to master so that i can try out (15:31 - 15:36)
other characters without feeling like (15:34 - 15:38)
i'm losing progress (15:36 - 15:40)
and like (15:38 - 15:42)
this is this is now my goal to get to (15:40 - 15:45)
master so that i can play (15:42 - 15:48)
other defenders i can play speedster and (15:45 - 15:52)
see if i like them without (15:48 - 15:52)
you could do standalone (15:52 - 15:57)
a bunch of stuff (15:54 - 15:57)
why not do sander for those (15:57 - 16:01)
uh because the other day that i did (15:59 - 16:04)
stander every standard match i did was (16:01 - 16:06)
a bot match (16:04 - 16:09)
literally i did five bop matches in a (16:06 - 16:12)
row and i i don't know why i don't know (16:09 - 16:13)
if there wasn't anybody playing in (16:12 - 16:15)
standard but i'm like (16:13 - 16:17)
i'm playing against bots and the bots (16:15 - 16:19)
are really stupid so i can't (16:17 - 16:22)
actually figure out what i am and (16:19 - 16:24)
am not doing (16:22 - 16:26)
in response to actual players because (16:24 - 16:28)
the robots charge it and back up and (16:26 - 16:29)
charging back up but like this isn't (16:28 - 16:30)
real (16:29 - 16:32)
play (16:30 - 16:34)
it was very frustrating so i'm like i'm (16:32 - 16:36)
out i just need to get master here's (16:34 - 16:39)
your tip from league uh you set up a (16:36 - 16:41)
second account called a smurf account (16:39 - 16:44)
that's the one you don't care about (16:41 - 16:46)
and then you use that one to fool around (16:44 - 16:48)
with and then when you get good then you (16:46 - 16:51)
transfer it to your main account (16:48 - 16:53)
i don't want a smurf account (16:51 - 16:56)
i also there there are so many (16:53 - 16:57)
like uh (16:56 - 16:58)
there there are a lot of people in our (16:57 - 17:00)
in our twitch streams or just a lot of (16:58 - 17:02)
people a lot of streamers on twitch that (17:00 - 17:05)
do have secondary accounts and (17:02 - 17:06)
there are also lots of people that have (17:05 - 17:08)
two pokemon go accounts (17:06 - 17:11)
and for me i was like (17:08 - 17:13)
i know my habits if i have two pokemon (17:11 - 17:15)
go accounts all of a sudden i'm buying (17:13 - 17:17)
raid passes on both or all of a sudden (17:15 - 17:19)
i'm buying or my my other accounts going (17:17 - 17:21)
to get the good stuff and then i'm going (17:19 - 17:22)
to have to like grind heavier on that to (17:21 - 17:24)
get the like stardust i i don't want to (17:22 - 17:27)
deal with that i'm a plus against (17:24 - 17:29)
it's against tus uh (17:27 - 17:31)
the terms of service you agree to not i (17:29 - 17:33)
take only one account per person come on (17:31 - 17:34)
oh niantic i'm like because i don't (17:33 - 17:36)
think that's in the tos for unite i (17:34 - 17:37)
don't think they care (17:36 - 17:40)
but now i after getting to mass rank i (17:37 - 17:41)
understand why all these people made (17:40 - 17:44)
secondary accounts it's not fun playing (17:41 - 17:45)
in master rank (17:44 - 17:47)
it was more fun (17:45 - 17:50)
to get to master rank (17:47 - 17:52)
than it is to sit in a master rank match (17:50 - 17:54)
and be like (17:52 - 17:54)
no (17:54 - 17:58)
no one here is better no one here uses (17:55 - 18:00)
their turn signals no one here is going (17:58 - 18:02)
to dreadna (18:00 - 18:03)
they stopped playing after five minutes (18:02 - 18:07)
because i had two master rank matches (18:03 - 18:09)
where peop where two people went to (18:07 - 18:11)
jungle (18:09 - 18:13)
and they fought over jungle which is (18:11 - 18:15)
which is (18:13 - 18:15)
it's so frustrating like (18:16 - 18:20)
like they have like what pride do you (18:18 - 18:22)
have at this point (18:20 - 18:23)
first off the zara aura said they were (18:22 - 18:25)
going to jungle mr greninja you didn't (18:23 - 18:27)
say where you're going and now you're (18:25 - 18:29)
going to be the one that's like refusing (18:27 - 18:30)
to leave (18:29 - 18:32)
i i i actually i feel like i can't play (18:30 - 18:34)
the game i feel like (18:32 - 18:36)
well okay come help me get to master (18:34 - 18:38)
rake and then we could not play the game (18:36 - 18:40)
together plus i need to get my lucario (18:38 - 18:42)
ears through wins (18:40 - 18:44)
that's true i need to get my car yours (18:42 - 18:46)
too play with me (18:44 - 18:48)
help me (18:46 - 18:50)
is that a fashion item (18:48 - 18:53)
yeah they're bad but i want them (18:50 - 18:54)
uh (18:53 - 18:57)
some brilliant diamond shiny pearl news (18:54 - 18:58)
actually (18:57 - 19:00)
what this is off nintendo soup this is (18:58 - 19:02)
it's just a tweet i couldn't find the (19:00 - 19:03)
tweet that they have the tweet here on (19:02 - 19:05)
the website so (19:03 - 19:07)
nintendo soup (19:05 - 19:09)
it's a website there's a website for (19:07 - 19:10)
every nintendo food item nintendo (19:09 - 19:14)
mushroom nintendo steak nintendo yeah (19:10 - 19:16)
nintendo sushi (19:14 - 19:18)
french (19:16 - 19:21)
uh silk french soup that's oh silk pie (19:18 - 19:25)
uh you know the lgbtqa (19:21 - 19:27)
nintendo iced coffee (19:25 - 19:30)
uh so (19:27 - 19:31)
it's it's (19:30 - 19:33)
it's a series of tweets it says the it's (19:31 - 19:36)
about the union room (19:33 - 19:37)
nintendo of (19:36 - 19:38)
america (19:37 - 19:41)
says the union room is where you will (19:38 - 19:43)
interact battle trade with trainers all (19:41 - 19:45)
over the world in diamond and pearl (19:43 - 19:49)
easily access the union room anywhere in (19:45 - 19:50)
the cinahl region by pressing the (19:49 - 19:53)
nintendo switch y button so that's (19:50 - 19:56)
it's the new wycombe that is the news in (19:53 - 19:59)
itself not restricted to pokemon centers (19:56 - 20:00)
right so if anyone's never played (19:59 - 20:01)
diamond on pearl you had to go to the (20:00 - 20:03)
pokemon center you had to go up to the (20:01 - 20:04)
top floor (20:03 - 20:07)
um (20:04 - 20:07)
so and then they they have more tweets (20:08 - 20:12)
here they say gather with friends family (20:10 - 20:14)
and other trainers using local (20:12 - 20:16)
communication in the local room (20:14 - 20:18)
trade battle and enjoy activities with (20:16 - 20:21)
other trainers you know or new trainers (20:18 - 20:24)
you come across while out and about (20:21 - 20:27)
and then they tweet with the nintendo (20:24 - 20:30)
switch online access the global room in (20:27 - 20:32)
brilliant diamond and shining pearl (20:30 - 20:34)
trainers all around the world can gather (20:32 - 20:36)
here in a single room for trades battles (20:34 - 20:38)
and activities so (20:36 - 20:41)
there's a local (20:38 - 20:42)
room (20:41 - 20:44)
there's a (20:42 - 20:48)
union room which we press the y button (20:44 - 20:50)
and then there's a global room (20:48 - 20:53)
which seems like the other room well (20:50 - 20:55)
i think it's you go to the union room (20:53 - 20:58)
and then you pick global or local global (20:55 - 20:59)
oh (20:58 - 21:00)
i see i thought they were saying there (20:59 - 21:03)
were three different rooms i see (21:00 - 21:05)
so here's the thing though (21:03 - 21:07)
how (21:05 - 21:07)
big and bad is that global room gonna be (21:07 - 21:13)
like why com is already bad (21:10 - 21:15)
and now it's got an interface of people (21:13 - 21:17)
walking around of so you're basically (21:15 - 21:19)
gonna get like (21:17 - 21:22)
30 people who pop in and out as it (21:19 - 21:23)
refreshes (21:22 - 21:26)
i am not a fan of this idea (21:23 - 21:28)
of the global room right now because i (21:26 - 21:30)
hate the wycombe so much well it's going (21:28 - 21:33)
to be like wild area or like your lower (21:30 - 21:36)
screen in uh x and y and omega ruby and (21:33 - 21:38)
alpha sapphire where it's like you'd go (21:36 - 21:40)
online and then all of a sudden like all (21:38 - 21:42)
the faces would scroll away just scroll (21:40 - 21:46)
past in a constant (21:42 - 21:46)
egg hatching oh power please (21:46 - 21:51)
[Laughter] (21:48 - 21:53)
i do i do (21:51 - 21:56)
it is humorous that they try a different (21:53 - 21:58)
online system every game and they have (21:56 - 21:59)
it (21:58 - 22:00)
i know people are like oh the x and y (21:59 - 22:02)
one was so good it was like okay i don't (22:00 - 22:04)
think it was like okay yeah i don't (22:02 - 22:05)
think it was like the thing they should (22:04 - 22:08)
have stuck with never um (22:05 - 22:10)
and then people didn't like that (22:08 - 22:11)
for (22:10 - 22:13)
life that's why that was the greatest (22:11 - 22:15)
puzzle was pretty good (22:13 - 22:17)
i mean so festive plus is how i think (22:15 - 22:19)
the union room's gonna be right like (22:17 - 22:21)
people will just zap it and zap out like (22:19 - 22:22)
they did in the festive plaza when you (22:21 - 22:23)
walked around (22:22 - 22:26)
y-cob would be good if those filters (22:23 - 22:27)
worked (22:26 - 22:30)
yeah and they'd like if i could say like (22:27 - 22:33)
why com or why com anyone on my friends (22:30 - 22:35)
list and it only refreshed people on my (22:33 - 22:36)
friends list it would actually be (22:35 - 22:39)
incredible correct even even more basic (22:36 - 22:42)
than that let me say that i only want to (22:39 - 22:44)
see things from my friends and if i (22:42 - 22:47)
don't have any friends on right now just (22:44 - 22:50)
leave it alone (22:47 - 22:53)
i will get no notifications until (22:50 - 22:55)
my friend shows up all right okay cool (22:53 - 22:57)
they could have even added something (22:55 - 22:59)
like i'm only looking for fire raids (22:57 - 23:01)
because like what if you're trying to (22:59 - 23:03)
grind a gmax charizard or something (23:01 - 23:05)
right like it would it would kind of be (23:03 - 23:06)
probably a lot to be like i'm only (23:05 - 23:09)
looking for charizards but (23:06 - 23:11)
i don't know why com co it has like it's (23:09 - 23:14)
it's like two steps away from being good (23:11 - 23:16)
festival plaza may be like six steps (23:14 - 23:18)
away from me i think two steps is being (23:16 - 23:20)
very generous (23:18 - 23:23)
i think it's i think it's as far away (23:20 - 23:26)
from being good as the festival plaza (23:23 - 23:27)
was (23:26 - 23:29)
um oh you know they had that nintendo (23:27 - 23:32)
direct speaking of nintendo (23:29 - 23:34)
i i want to shut down this narrative (23:32 - 23:36)
because it's really frustrating (23:34 - 23:39)
uh so what narrative is happening on (23:36 - 23:40)
your (23:39 - 23:41)
uh (23:40 - 23:42)
twitch stream that's happening nowhere (23:41 - 23:44)
else he's angry that people are saying (23:42 - 23:45)
the new monster hunter is going to be (23:44 - 23:48)
about vampires that's why (23:45 - 23:50)
i'm into i'm into not the new monster (23:48 - 23:52)
hunter (23:50 - 23:54)
yeah you are this this is a (23:52 - 23:55)
no cause (23:54 - 23:57)
cause joe from cerebe tweeted about it (23:55 - 23:58)
too and people still don't seem to (23:57 - 24:00)
listen (23:58 - 24:02)
so they announced the nintendo direct (24:00 - 24:02)
right (24:02 - 24:04)
and they said man that nintendo direct (24:02 - 24:06)
made me so mad not because there was a (24:04 - 24:07)
lack of pokemon stuff but because (24:06 - 24:09)
specifically in their youtube (24:07 - 24:10)
description for the nintendo direct it (24:09 - 24:12)
said we are focusing on games coming out (24:10 - 24:14)
in winter of 2020 and then they (24:12 - 24:16)
proceeded not to talk about any game (24:14 - 24:17)
coming out in winter 2020 besides mario (24:16 - 24:19)
party (24:17 - 24:22)
act razor (24:19 - 24:24)
so (24:22 - 24:24)
so it is always possible and there's (24:25 - 24:30)
this narrative where like (24:27 - 24:32)
the narrative is this nintendo doesn't (24:30 - 24:34)
talk about pokemon in nintendo directs (24:32 - 24:36)
pokemon is too big for that and pokemon (24:34 - 24:38)
directs exist (24:36 - 24:40)
which is inherently false (24:38 - 24:42)
this is not true (24:40 - 24:45)
and so there there was a possibility (24:42 - 24:48)
that when nintendo on their youtube says (24:45 - 24:49)
we're talking about games coming out in (24:48 - 24:52)
the winter of 2020 you would think oh (24:49 - 24:54)
they might show something for diamond (24:52 - 24:55)
and pearl and they didn't and that's (24:54 - 24:58)
fine but that's not to say they won't (24:55 - 25:01)
ever do it like we just read a (24:58 - 25:03)
three-part tweet from the official (25:01 - 25:05)
nintendo twitter talking about new (25:03 - 25:08)
features of diamond and pearl (25:05 - 25:09)
why (25:08 - 25:12)
answer me that the pokemon the pokemon (25:09 - 25:13)
company has their own twitter (25:12 - 25:16)
they have actually like 18 twitters they (25:13 - 25:16)
got like (25:16 - 25:19)
17 the japanese twitters they got one (25:16 - 25:20)
english twitter (25:19 - 25:22)
why did they tweet about it (25:20 - 25:24)
just because pokemon directs exist (25:22 - 25:26)
doesn't mean the nintendo directs won't (25:24 - 25:29)
talk about pokemon in (25:26 - 25:31)
last year (25:29 - 25:34)
2020 (25:31 - 25:34)
the dlc (25:35 - 25:38)
for crown tundra (25:36 - 25:42)
and the other one isle of armor l armor (25:38 - 25:44)
featured in a nintendo direct that was (25:42 - 25:48)
only a year ago in 2019 they had a 40 (25:44 - 25:49)
minute (25:48 - 25:50)
nintendo direct (25:49 - 25:53)
where 25 minutes was luigi's mansion (25:50 - 25:56)
three and the other 15 minutes was sword (25:53 - 25:59)
and shield (25:56 - 25:59)
and so the like the the narrative of (25:59 - 26:04)
well there well pokemon is too big for (26:01 - 26:06)
nintendo directs (26:04 - 26:07)
nintendo directs have been around since (26:06 - 26:10)
2011 pokemon directs have been around (26:07 - 26:12)
since 2013. (26:10 - 26:15)
these are not new things (26:12 - 26:18)
every single year a nintendo direct has (26:15 - 26:21)
covered pokemon except for this year (26:18 - 26:23)
nothing has really changed this year (26:21 - 26:26)
except one kovid (26:23 - 26:27)
from everything that's happened and you (26:26 - 26:29)
know game companies are playing catch up (26:27 - 26:32)
and number two there's only been two (26:29 - 26:34)
directs this year there hasn't been a (26:32 - 26:36)
lot usually there's four in a year if (26:34 - 26:38)
you can go to a wikipedia and look (26:36 - 26:40)
there's usually a lot of directs some (26:38 - 26:42)
some well there were four this year but (26:40 - 26:43)
two were indie directs which were (26:42 - 26:45)
focused on like your starter values or (26:43 - 26:48)
your delta runes and stuff (26:45 - 26:51)
but but i would wager to guess there (26:48 - 26:52)
hasn't been a lot of directs this year (26:51 - 26:53)
is because all these game developers are (26:52 - 26:56)
still struggling to catch up (26:53 - 26:59)
because of lycovid and everything (26:56 - 27:01)
like people are behind we know this is (26:59 - 27:02)
happening where like the game rollout's (27:01 - 27:05)
gonna be a little bit slower (27:02 - 27:08)
um because video game companies have (27:05 - 27:10)
been saying that (27:08 - 27:10)
so i (27:11 - 27:14)
this the silly narrative of life well (27:12 - 27:17)
pokemon is too big for nintendo directs (27:14 - 27:19)
you're wrong it's fine it's okay to be (27:17 - 27:20)
wrong (27:19 - 27:21)
now that you have this information that (27:20 - 27:23)
i have shared with you or you could just (27:21 - 27:25)
go to the wikipedia and look at how many (27:23 - 27:26)
times the nintendo direct has covered (27:25 - 27:29)
pokemon stuff in the last 10 plus years (27:26 - 27:32)
you now have that information enjoy it (27:29 - 27:34)
arcanine is a giant pokemon and a (27:32 - 27:36)
59-inch plush is coming to the pokemon (27:34 - 27:39)
center it's 450 greg how many did you (27:36 - 27:40)
order (27:39 - 27:43)
uh right now (27:40 - 27:45)
i have ordered (27:43 - 27:46)
ten (27:45 - 27:49)
five for me and five to sell on the ebay (27:46 - 27:51)
market (27:49 - 27:54)
smart choice it makes makes sense (27:51 - 27:56)
here's the thing (27:54 - 27:56)
there is no way my dogs would not attack (27:57 - 28:03)
this (28:00 - 28:04)
wait why because it looks like a dog or (28:03 - 28:08)
just because it's the big stuffed (28:04 - 28:09)
thing (28:08 - 28:12)
that's very very very furry and it is (28:09 - 28:17)
so cute but every ounce of that says (28:12 - 28:20)
this is something i should chew on (28:17 - 28:20)
but yeah i would (28:20 - 28:26)
i'm not that big of an arcanine (28:22 - 28:26)
fan (28:27 - 28:32)
to pay 450 dollars to lead on a big (28:28 - 28:34)
arcanine (28:32 - 28:34)
as somebody with a giant mouth plush (28:37 - 28:42)
where is giant mouse which somebody (28:40 - 28:43)
bought for you (28:42 - 28:46)
yes giant meowth is sacked out on that (28:43 - 28:47)
chair in the living room don't you (28:46 - 28:49)
follow the stories (28:47 - 28:53)
yeah he's in the living room right now (28:49 - 28:53)
the problem with these is there's just (28:53 - 28:58)
nowhere to put them (28:55 - 28:58)
one your couch you have room to put it (28:59 - 29:04)
when you literally takes up the entire (29:01 - 29:07)
couch yeah and you get to cuddle with it (29:04 - 29:09)
my husband also takes up much of the (29:07 - 29:11)
couch and i don't say i don't have a (29:09 - 29:13)
place for him in my life (29:11 - 29:15)
[Laughter] (29:13 - 29:17)
he does move from room to room like (29:15 - 29:18)
giant miata (29:17 - 29:20)
when i don't know where to put him yeah (29:18 - 29:22)
exactly (29:20 - 29:24)
what is the difference between (29:22 - 29:27)
the plush and the person i married (29:24 - 29:31)
i think the plush signifies (29:27 - 29:33)
that you're poor (29:31 - 29:34)
not because (29:33 - 29:38)
not because of the price (29:34 - 29:38)
but because your house is not big enough (29:39 - 29:43)
to store it (29:41 - 29:47)
what does that have to do with poverty (29:43 - 29:49)
like if i had a mansion (29:47 - 29:52)
with like this bedroom that was like 2 (29:49 - 29:54)
000 square feet (29:52 - 29:57)
which which my house isn't even like a (29:54 - 29:59)
thousand square feet i would be like ah (29:57 - 30:02)
i can i can decorate my huge bedroom i'm (29:59 - 30:04)
gonna like like you remember you (30:02 - 30:07)
remember like nintendo (30:04 - 30:09)
commercials for like ring fit adventure (30:07 - 30:11)
yeah or like literally anything and you (30:09 - 30:13)
look into their like (30:11 - 30:16)
like 1500 square foot living room with (30:13 - 30:19)
like perfect sunlight and one couch in (30:16 - 30:20)
the center and they have more than (30:19 - 30:23)
enough space to like play ring fit and (30:20 - 30:25)
have an open set in a warehouse they (30:23 - 30:27)
built two walls we're like that's good (30:25 - 30:29)
enough for this right but no one has (30:27 - 30:33)
this living room except for rich people (30:29 - 30:35)
and if you and if you're only living in (30:33 - 30:37)
like an 800 square foot apartment you (30:35 - 30:39)
buy the arcanine well now your (30:37 - 30:41)
apartment's only 600 square foot because (30:39 - 30:43)
the arcanine's taking up 200 of it life (30:41 - 30:45)
choices life choices that's true (30:43 - 30:47)
look (30:45 - 30:49)
when you move here and build streamer (30:47 - 30:52)
house for all of us to live in we will (30:49 - 30:54)
have a room (30:52 - 30:56)
that is just for (30:54 - 30:58)
giant plushies (30:56 - 31:00)
okay and when you need one for stream (30:58 - 31:02)
you go to the plushie room you go in (31:00 - 31:05)
there and you walk amongst the animals (31:02 - 31:06)
grab what you need for your stream that (31:05 - 31:08)
day (31:06 - 31:10)
it's ideal that's how you actually know (31:08 - 31:13)
you made it (31:10 - 31:13)
all right (31:15 - 31:19)
i mean i agree with that psi yes yeah (31:16 - 31:20)
yeah (31:19 - 31:23)
it's 450 you can pre-order it now it (31:20 - 31:24)
ships in may (31:23 - 31:26)

all right (34:08 - 34:12)
uh so it says today we have announced (34:09 - 34:15)
the pokemon tcg live a new app that (34:12 - 34:17)
trainers will enjoy the pokemon trading (34:15 - 34:19)
card game in an updated digital format (34:17 - 34:22)
playable on smartphones tablets pc (34:19 - 34:25)
coming to pokemon.com also for anyone (34:22 - 34:27)
listening if you're not into the tcg i i (34:25 - 34:29)
get it (34:27 - 34:31)
it's it's very complicated it's a lot (34:29 - 34:33)
the whole (34:31 - 34:36)
reason why i for several years on this (34:33 - 34:37)
program (34:36 - 34:39)
people would come into people would (34:37 - 34:41)
would ask me on twitter or they come (34:39 - 34:42)
into my twitch streams they'd be like (34:41 - 34:43)
what do you want most from the pokemon (34:42 - 34:44)
company you'd be like do you want (34:43 - 34:46)
diamond a pro remix do you want black (34:44 - 34:48)
and white no i don't want any of that i (34:46 - 34:50)
want a new tcg client (34:48 - 34:52)
i said this i've (34:50 - 34:54)
really boomed my chest for years about (34:52 - 34:56)
this this is what i want i want a new (34:54 - 34:59)
tcg client because the current tcgo (34:56 - 35:02)
was launched in i think 2009 or (34:59 - 35:04)
something like that it's like (35:02 - 35:05)
it's very old (35:04 - 35:07)
running on hamsters (35:05 - 35:10)
uh it was awful (35:07 - 35:12)
but the reason i loved it so much is (35:10 - 35:15)
because one you could actually play (35:12 - 35:18)
matches it especially in a (35:15 - 35:22)
post-pandemic world it was and (35:18 - 35:24)
especially before a post-pandemic world (35:22 - 35:26)
it was hard to find people in your city (35:24 - 35:28)
who played the game and who you wanted (35:26 - 35:32)
to tolerate and be around true and and (35:28 - 35:34)
who understood the rules so (35:32 - 35:37)
the pokemon trading card game (35:34 - 35:40)
can be very complicated and intimidating (35:37 - 35:43)
and the only good thing that tcgo really (35:40 - 35:46)
did was make sure you follow the rules (35:43 - 35:48)
and it taught you the rules really well (35:46 - 35:49)
even though everything in that game (35:48 - 35:51)
looked bad the wood texture was like (35:49 - 35:53)
from 1942 (35:51 - 35:56)
like the tutorial and teaching you how (35:53 - 35:59)
to play the game like it did it so well (35:56 - 36:02)
yeah um i learned from it (35:59 - 36:03)
it was it was that was like the the one (36:02 - 36:05)
redeeming feature here (36:03 - 36:07)
so (36:05 - 36:09)
some key features here oh actually let's (36:07 - 36:12)
let's finish the press release (36:09 - 36:12)
trainers of all skill levels will enjoy (36:17 - 36:22)
the new pokemon tcg live (36:19 - 36:24)
name could do some work those who are (36:22 - 36:26)
just getting started with the tcg will (36:24 - 36:27)
find it easy to learn while experienced (36:26 - 36:29)
players will discover the fresh (36:27 - 36:30)
challenge to improve and test their (36:29 - 36:32)
skills in addition to familiar (36:30 - 36:34)
activities like battling and deck (36:32 - 36:36)
building trainers can personalize their (36:34 - 36:38)
experience with customizable avatars and (36:36 - 36:40)
accessories the tcg live will be updated (36:38 - 36:42)
periodically with new content features (36:40 - 36:43)
following the initial launch to (36:42 - 36:45)
continuously offer new challenges and (36:43 - 36:48)
experience with the arrival of tcg live (36:45 - 36:51)
the pokemon tcg online will be retiring (36:48 - 36:53)
download access will be removed from the (36:51 - 36:55)
app store google play and pokemon.com (36:53 - 36:58)
shortly prior to the launch existing tcg (36:55 - 37:00)
online players will be easily able to (36:58 - 37:02)
transfer their accounts and game data to (37:00 - 37:04)
tcg live upon its release (37:02 - 37:07)
so far so good perfect (37:04 - 37:09)
the tcg cards from sword and shield as (37:07 - 37:11)
well as the cards from sun and moon lost (37:09 - 37:13)
thunder through sun and moon cosmic (37:11 - 37:15)
eclipse are transferable and playable (37:13 - 37:16)
live at launch (37:15 - 37:18)
that's technically (37:16 - 37:19)
accurate (37:18 - 37:22)
of what the meta is currently cards (37:19 - 37:23)
earlier from sun and moon series as well (37:22 - 37:25)
as x and y and black and white will be (37:23 - 37:26)
transferable at launch but not be (37:25 - 37:30)
playable until a future update (37:26 - 37:31)
players will only be able to transfer up (37:30 - 37:33)
to four unique (37:31 - 37:34)
uh (37:33 - 37:37)
copies of pokemon tcg cards one copy of (37:34 - 37:40)
an a specs one copy of a prism that's (37:37 - 37:42)
technically true you can only play one (37:40 - 37:44)
of those cards anyways 59 copies of a (37:42 - 37:47)
basic energy and additional copies will (37:44 - 37:49)
not be transferred (37:47 - 37:51)
uh so some key features here is there (37:49 - 37:53)
will be it'll be free to play without (37:51 - 37:56)
any in-app purchases this is this is (37:53 - 37:58)
very confusing (37:56 - 37:59)
uh we'll get to that (37:58 - 38:01)
uh there will be a both ranked and (37:59 - 38:04)
casual modes which is awesome so in (38:01 - 38:07)
ptcgo there was only the latter (38:04 - 38:10)
the latter was theoretically ranked (38:07 - 38:14)
but you would never see your ranking (38:10 - 38:16)
so (38:14 - 38:19)
um (38:16 - 38:19)
and there was no way to see a ranking (38:21 - 38:25)
and there was no way to know exactly (38:23 - 38:27)
when it reset people kind of speculated (38:25 - 38:29)
and narrowed it down but ideally um (38:27 - 38:31)
there was like an elo system (38:29 - 38:33)
let's just say you i'm gonna have to (38:31 - 38:36)
explain elo real quick so in chess (38:33 - 38:38)
or league of legends or any other (38:36 - 38:40)
competitive game there you you would (38:38 - 38:42)
normally start at like a 1200 ranking (38:40 - 38:45)
and if you if you uh lose you would like (38:42 - 38:47)
lose like 10 points so you would go to (38:45 - 38:49)
1190 and if you won you would win 10 (38:47 - 38:52)
points you would go to like 12 12 10. (38:49 - 38:54)
and ideally the game would pair you (38:52 - 38:56)
against people who have similar elos so (38:54 - 38:58)
if you're really really good and you had (38:56 - 39:01)
an elo of 1400 which is 200 points above (38:58 - 39:02)
average (39:01 - 39:03)
the game would try to pair you against (39:02 - 39:06)
other people with an elo 1400 (39:03 - 39:10)
and in reverse if you were very bad at (39:06 - 39:13)
tcgo and you had an elo of like 1100 100 (39:10 - 39:15)
points under average it would try to (39:13 - 39:17)
pair you against the similar people (39:15 - 39:18)
right so (39:17 - 39:19)
it's a way to like balance and make (39:18 - 39:21)
games fair (39:19 - 39:22)
um (39:21 - 39:24)
the thing about ptcgo is that system (39:22 - 39:27)
existed but you could never see it and (39:24 - 39:29)
you never knew where you were at but it (39:27 - 39:31)
was it was very obvious if you were (39:29 - 39:34)
um so like when i i stepped away from (39:31 - 39:36)
ptcgo for like (39:34 - 39:39)
six years like when it when ptc joe (39:36 - 39:41)
launched i was redeeming cards and i was (39:39 - 39:43)
playing and i had a bunch of cards and (39:41 - 39:45)
then i stopped playing and then when (39:43 - 39:48)
sun and moon came out and the tcg got (39:45 - 39:50)
good again because spoiler the x and y (39:48 - 39:53)
tcg was very bad um (39:50 - 39:55)
i played like a drampa (39:53 - 39:56)
deck i can't remember what it was it was (39:55 - 39:58)
like drampa with double colorless there (39:56 - 40:00)
was another pokemon and i won 30 games (39:58 - 40:01)
in a row (40:00 - 40:03)
and the reason i won 30 games in a row (40:01 - 40:04)
wasn't because i was using the best deck (40:03 - 40:07)
or because whatever it's because i had a (40:04 - 40:09)
fresh elo (40:07 - 40:10)
and so they were pairing me against all (40:09 - 40:13)
people with that elo and i just knew how (40:10 - 40:14)
to play the game (40:13 - 40:16)
um it wasn't because i was like (40:14 - 40:18)
magically good or like oh (40:16 - 40:20)
the rest is like it's just my elo was (40:18 - 40:22)
like low and i was able to just go (40:20 - 40:23)
through it and then i got to people that (40:22 - 40:24)
weren't then my skill set and then it (40:23 - 40:26)
ended up being like 50 50. (40:24 - 40:28)
um (40:26 - 40:28)
so they're doing a ranked and they're (40:29 - 40:32)
doing casual that's awesome skilled (40:30 - 40:34)
based matchmaking (40:32 - 40:36)
they said those words okay they said (40:34 - 40:39)
there's going to be a battle pass (40:36 - 40:39)
which (40:39 - 40:41)
every game under the sun has a battle (40:39 - 40:44)
pass now it's a gotcha now so yeah and (40:41 - 40:47)
they said no more pac rng or trading (40:44 - 40:50)
the ptcg live (40:47 - 40:52)
boy that does the tcg live yeah it (40:50 - 40:54)
doesn't ptc (40:52 - 40:56)
doesn't really roll off the tongue will (40:54 - 40:58)
not have player to player trading extra (40:56 - 41:00)
copies of the cards are con converted to (40:58 - 41:04)
credits which can be exchanged to obtain (41:00 - 41:07)
copies of any uh owned or unknown (41:04 - 41:10)
unowned card (41:07 - 41:10)
okay this is probably the (41:11 - 41:15)
thing that either people are really into (41:13 - 41:17)
or really not into (41:15 - 41:18)
what are we happy about or really (41:17 - 41:22)
unhappy about yeah and i believe magic (41:18 - 41:24)
arena does the same exact thing there's (41:22 - 41:26)
no trading in magic arena (41:24 - 41:29)
if you get extra cards they get turned (41:26 - 41:31)
into credits or dust and you can (41:29 - 41:32)
exchange hearthstone also does that like (41:31 - 41:34)
hearthstone you can like dust a bunch of (41:32 - 41:36)
cards and then use that to buy other (41:34 - 41:38)
stuff (41:36 - 41:40)
um (41:38 - 41:40)
greg as a non-tcg players (41:42 - 41:47)
is this good would you is are you (41:45 - 41:49)
interested in trading are you interested (41:47 - 41:52)
in just buying what you're missing (41:49 - 41:52)
the answer is dying what you're missing (41:57 - 42:01)
in general i i always shall just buy (41:59 - 42:03)
what i'm missing because i find trading (42:01 - 42:04)
sometimes to be very frustrating (42:03 - 42:06)
experience (42:04 - 42:07)
um (42:06 - 42:08)
i'm (42:07 - 42:09)
changing on that but usually like my (42:08 - 42:11)
go-to is whatever i'm missing i just buy (42:09 - 42:14)
it (42:11 - 42:14)
and just be like okay that i know they (42:14 - 42:19)
have it they've listed the quality that (42:17 - 42:21)
it's in (42:19 - 42:22)
done (42:21 - 42:27)
well so the issue is trading in ptcgo (42:22 - 42:28)
was (42:27 - 42:30)
number one it was (42:28 - 42:31)
like (42:30 - 42:34)
i can't what is the word like awful (42:31 - 42:36)
it was bad but it was like if you were (42:34 - 42:37)
new (42:36 - 42:40)
and you didn't understand (42:37 - 42:43)
like have a really firm grasp of the (42:40 - 42:45)
understa understanding the value of (42:43 - 42:46)
things (42:45 - 42:47)
it (42:46 - 42:50)
was just confusing as all hack because (42:47 - 42:53)
like why is one pack of this particular (42:50 - 42:57)
uh set which ran randomly when you open (42:53 - 42:59)
it could be a bunch of garbage but why (42:57 - 43:02)
is that worth like four (42:59 - 43:05)
super hollow extra rare b-maxes right (43:02 - 43:08)
why why is that trade you know the the (43:05 - 43:09)
the whole (43:08 - 43:10)
um (43:09 - 43:13)
value exchange system represented in the (43:10 - 43:16)
ptc geo trades it was just (43:13 - 43:18)
awful and it was too easy for people to (43:16 - 43:20)
get scammed (43:18 - 43:22)
really this this is the thing i would (43:20 - 43:25)
compare ptgo to bear with me (43:22 - 43:29)
here packs of cigarettes in prison (43:25 - 43:33)
close i agree i agree (43:29 - 43:33)
greg for the audio for the audio (43:35 - 43:39)
listeners craig's mind is about to (43:37 - 43:42)
explode there has to be a better (43:39 - 43:43)
no (43:42 - 43:45)
no it's it's it's it's that's pretty (43:43 - 43:46)
close (43:45 - 43:48)
although like yeah and you have like (43:46 - 43:50)
individual cigarettes versus a pack of (43:48 - 43:52)
stickers but you have to imagine (43:50 - 43:55)
that either the pack of cigarettes could (43:52 - 43:57)
have like (43:55 - 43:59)
eight obviously there's going to be like (43:57 - 44:00)
18 (43:59 - 44:04)
that are unsmokable (44:00 - 44:07)
and then 19th is good and like 20th is (44:04 - 44:10)
awesome and worth the value of like all (44:07 - 44:13)
the other cigarettes combined or (44:10 - 44:15)
you might get 20 cigarettes that just (44:13 - 44:17)
aren't even worth a full point yeah you (44:15 - 44:18)
don't know if those cigarettes were (44:17 - 44:21)
soggy or not exactly (44:18 - 44:23)
they could be stale too you don't know (44:21 - 44:24)
what you're getting they could have been (44:23 - 44:27)
stale cigarettes (44:24 - 44:29)
okay okay here's the okay (44:27 - 44:32)
when when i got back into tcgo (44:29 - 44:35)
around drampa time (44:32 - 44:37)
before drampa and pre (44:35 - 44:39)
after grandpa (44:37 - 44:41)
there was a website (44:39 - 44:45)
um that would list prices for (44:41 - 44:48)
booster packs so here's the thing i know (44:45 - 44:49)
the people that are like (44:48 - 44:51)
screaming (44:49 - 44:54)
about no trading i i (44:51 - 44:56)
i i ha i feel for you there there is a (44:54 - 44:58)
fun (44:56 - 45:00)
system to trading (44:58 - 45:02)
and they're they're like looking at the (45:00 - 45:04)
trade board it can be exciting and like (45:02 - 45:06)
trying to find good deals can be (45:04 - 45:07)
exciting like we've all window shopped (45:06 - 45:10)
on ebay and stuff like oh (45:07 - 45:12)
somebody miscategorized this (45:10 - 45:13)
but there's also the thing on ebay where (45:12 - 45:16)
you're like oh cool ps5 for only 300 (45:13 - 45:17)
bucks and then you didn't read it and it (45:16 - 45:19)
says like ps5 box only and then you get (45:17 - 45:22)
a cardboard box for 500 (45:19 - 45:24)
like both of those exist like it's (45:22 - 45:27)
really easy to get scammed it was also (45:24 - 45:29)
not that easy to find deals but when you (45:27 - 45:32)
found a deal you felt like you've you've (45:29 - 45:34)
accomplished everything in life (45:32 - 45:35)
uh (45:34 - 45:37)
but (45:35 - 45:37)
as a as like an average player or maybe (45:37 - 45:42)
somebody who just dabbles with uh the (45:39 - 45:44)
trading card game like for a month and (45:42 - 45:46)
then wait waits until new set comes out (45:44 - 45:47)
and comes back for a month (45:46 - 45:50)
it was like to go to a website that (45:47 - 45:52)
website doesn't exist anymore uh to go (45:50 - 45:54)
to a website and be like okay emerging (45:52 - 45:56)
powers is worth (45:54 - 46:00)
0.5 and noble victors is worth three and (45:56 - 46:03)
boundaries cross is worth four and the (46:00 - 46:05)
card i'm looking for is full art (46:03 - 46:09)
lysander and full art lysander is worth (46:05 - 46:11)
17 so i have like (46:09 - 46:13)
i have like 40 crimson invasions but (46:11 - 46:16)
crimson invasion is only worth (46:13 - 46:19)
.10001 because it's a garbage set but if (46:16 - 46:22)
i take 45 crimson invasions and then (46:19 - 46:23)
stick on one dark explorers and dark (46:22 - 46:26)
explorers is worth 15 i can maybe trade (46:23 - 46:28)
for lysander (46:26 - 46:31)
you have to you had to go to a website (46:28 - 46:33)
to figure this out because you're like i (46:31 - 46:35)
don't know how much full art cynthia is (46:33 - 46:39)
worth 64. okay do i want 64 (46:35 - 46:40)
sun and moon (46:39 - 46:44)
a lola's vacation or do i want uh (46:40 - 46:46)
evolving skies but even worse than this (46:44 - 46:48)
buy the cards i want because this even (46:46 - 46:51)
worse than all that madness is enough (46:48 - 46:54)
but it's like also (46:51 - 46:55)
you couldn't (46:54 - 47:00)
like i i need charizard right i need (46:55 - 47:02)
charizard to finish my deck (47:00 - 47:04)
there is no way (47:02 - 47:07)
that i could just easily go and say (47:04 - 47:09)
i need charizard (47:07 - 47:10)
what can i pay (47:09 - 47:12)
for a charizard (47:10 - 47:13)
right (47:12 - 47:17)
i can look at all the posted trades (47:13 - 47:19)
and once again there's no as steve was (47:17 - 47:21)
saying there's no (47:19 - 47:25)
internal to pt cgo value reference so i (47:21 - 47:27)
have to look at those and say all right (47:25 - 47:29)
what makes sense and then it's like can (47:27 - 47:32)
i buy packs in pt cgo that i can then (47:29 - 47:33)
trade for well what if nobody wants to (47:32 - 47:34)
trade charizard for packs what if they (47:33 - 47:36)
only want to trade it for other specific (47:34 - 47:37)
cards and i don't have those specific (47:36 - 47:40)
cards i can't get charizard (47:37 - 47:42)
it's it was just like right now (47:40 - 47:45)
i think that's the biggest thing too is (47:42 - 47:48)
if if you're just getting into pt like (47:45 - 47:49)
you let's let's say you took a year off (47:48 - 47:51)
you like you like skipped all of sun and (47:49 - 47:53)
moon the sword and shield you like the (47:51 - 47:55)
cards they they made an amazing roselia (47:53 - 47:56)
card greg you're like i want to build (47:55 - 47:59)
this resilient deck but you need uh tapu (47:56 - 48:01)
laylee and you're like i don't have a (47:59 - 48:02)
taboo layla i just started pl i didn't (48:01 - 48:04)
buy any sun and moon topule is rotated (48:02 - 48:06)
by the way just bear with me for this (48:04 - 48:08)
example uh but tapu leila was a very (48:06 - 48:09)
sought after very good card back in the (48:08 - 48:10)
day (48:09 - 48:12)
you were like i want i got my four (48:10 - 48:15)
azaleas i got my four rose raids i need (48:12 - 48:17)
two top uleles for this deck (48:15 - 48:19)
i don't know how much tapu layla is (48:17 - 48:20)
worth i don't have any more booster (48:19 - 48:22)
packs i don't have any good carts (48:20 - 48:23)
because i just stopped started playing (48:22 - 48:25)
so going to will's example how do i get (48:23 - 48:27)
this topu layla there's nothing in the (48:25 - 48:29)
game that requires like i i can't i (48:27 - 48:30)
can't trade i don't have anything to (48:29 - 48:32)
trade i don't have any booster packs to (48:30 - 48:34)
open how do i get this i can't play this (48:32 - 48:34)
deck (48:34 - 48:37)
and i just can't get tapulele and i (48:34 - 48:39)
could i guess you could like make a (48:37 - 48:41)
reddit account and be like hey does (48:39 - 48:44)
anyone have top like you ha it would be (48:41 - 48:47)
so hard to get two cards you're missing (48:44 - 48:49)
um and you might have a bunch of cards (48:47 - 48:50)
you don't care about or you don't know (48:49 - 48:52)
what they're worth or like when i got (48:50 - 48:54)
back in i had (48:52 - 48:56)
um (48:54 - 48:57)
my friend kid (48:56 - 48:59)
was watching my stream and i was like oh (48:57 - 49:02)
i have like 40 dark patches and i was (48:59 - 49:04)
like oh this person will give me 10 (49:02 - 49:05)
booster packs for a dark patch why would (49:04 - 49:07)
i not do that deal and he was like don't (49:05 - 49:08)
trade those dark patches they're worth (49:07 - 49:10)
way too much like 10 booster packs is (49:08 - 49:11)
not worth it you're getting scammed but (49:10 - 49:13)
to me as somebody who didn't play for (49:11 - 49:15)
several years i was like 10 booster (49:13 - 49:17)
packs for a dark patch like i got 40 (49:15 - 49:19)
dark patches in my basement right now i (49:17 - 49:20)
bought a lot of dark explorers i'm (49:19 - 49:22)
swimming in dark patches i got dark (49:20 - 49:25)
patches in the dark patches (49:22 - 49:27)
but but uh but like certain cards were (49:25 - 49:29)
just worth a lot because of legacy or (49:27 - 49:31)
expanded or whatever old format they (49:29 - 49:33)
called it (49:31 - 49:36)
um so i think (49:33 - 49:37)
this is better (49:36 - 49:40)
i i think the trading the i i understand (49:37 - 49:42)
why people like trading there was i i (49:40 - 49:44)
was i look i loved checking the trade (49:42 - 49:45)
boards (49:44 - 49:46)
but (49:45 - 49:48)
for (49:46 - 49:50)
but you can't say (49:48 - 49:52)
the game you can't say the game is going (49:50 - 49:53)
to be ruined (49:52 - 49:55)
because they're removing trading and (49:53 - 49:57)
then also not accept that trading was (49:55 - 50:00)
preventing more players and more players (49:57 - 50:03)
is better like the more like this this (50:00 - 50:04)
was the problem with unite (50:03 - 50:07)
i spent eight hours on unite and i've (50:04 - 50:09)
met i match with the same people (50:07 - 50:11)
constantly yeah and it's really (50:09 - 50:13)
discouraging to be like (50:11 - 50:15)
i can't beat this whoever this dude is (50:13 - 50:16)
on the other team that i keep running (50:15 - 50:19)
into i lost we can't beat this guy he's (50:16 - 50:21)
too good i don't know what he's doing (50:19 - 50:24)
but but like it's it you want as many (50:21 - 50:25)
players in the game for your game to be (50:24 - 50:27)
healthy and for more people to get in (50:25 - 50:30)
and for it to be accessible (50:27 - 50:32)
so if this is like the (50:30 - 50:34)
thing you have to give up i think it's (50:32 - 50:36)
worth it i think just being able to buy (50:34 - 50:37)
the charizard you're missing to finish (50:36 - 50:39)
your deck to play your deck that you're (50:37 - 50:41)
excited about is way more important than (50:39 - 50:43)
just being like well i want i miss (50:41 - 50:46)
trading 18 booster packs for one card (50:43 - 50:49)
like yeah i get it but (50:46 - 50:52)
if you have so (50:49 - 50:54)
this is one of my bigger things about (50:52 - 50:55)
all (50:54 - 50:57)
online things if you have the card in (50:55 - 50:58)
real life (50:57 - 51:00)
is there ever going to be a way to tell (50:58 - 51:02)
the system (51:00 - 51:05)
i have this physical card (51:02 - 51:07)
i think that was kind of implied with (51:05 - 51:09)
the what the way they were talking about (51:07 - 51:12)
live is i think it's going to be (51:09 - 51:13)
they're moving towards (51:12 - 51:16)
uh the the code cards in the packs will (51:13 - 51:17)
give you the cards that are in the packs (51:16 - 51:19)
that's kind of what i picked you didn't (51:17 - 51:20)
pick that up (51:19 - 51:22)
still (51:20 - 51:23)
i thought they said they were moving (51:22 - 51:26)
away from rng (51:23 - 51:26)
the (51:26 - 51:32)
pack will still give you (51:28 - 51:32)
cash how do i explain this the the the (51:35 - 51:39)
the you will still open booster packs in (51:37 - 51:41)
the game but you can't get any more than (51:39 - 51:43)
four duplicates (51:41 - 51:45)
so if you already got four oddishes you (51:43 - 51:47)
can't get a fifth oddish (51:45 - 51:48)
so that's like (51:47 - 51:50)
that's the rng they're getting rid of (51:48 - 51:52)
it's like um (51:50 - 51:53)
so (51:52 - 51:54)
would it it's like place it with (51:53 - 51:57)
something else i that that we're unsure (51:54 - 52:00)
of i'm trying to they're like uh gosh (51:57 - 52:03)
unite doesn't do this but there are some (52:00 - 52:05)
masters does this (52:03 - 52:06)
masters does this when you when when (52:05 - 52:09)
you're doing the like you can you can (52:06 - 52:11)
keep opening on the current box or you (52:09 - 52:13)
can skip to the next box yeah (52:11 - 52:15)
but once you pull something from the box (52:13 - 52:18)
you can't pull it again right so if you (52:15 - 52:19)
pulled like five good things well like (52:18 - 52:21)
why would you still pull on that box (52:19 - 52:22)
everything else is garbage just move to (52:21 - 52:24)
the next one right (52:22 - 52:27)
so i think it's more like that (52:24 - 52:29)
and (52:27 - 52:31)
see this is what always sort of turns me (52:29 - 52:34)
off of online things is if i have a (52:31 - 52:37)
thing that i paid for like i went to the (52:34 - 52:39)
store i bought a pack i got the cards (52:37 - 52:40)
that i wanted (52:39 - 52:43)
i have no way of telling the app (52:40 - 52:44)
i (52:43 - 52:47)
have these cards i have to then do (52:44 - 52:48)
another (52:47 - 52:50)
random pack (52:48 - 52:50)
in the (52:50 - 52:53)
in there and i may not get what i want (52:50 - 52:56)
it is a very it is what's turned me off (52:53 - 52:57)
of (52:56 - 52:59)
mtg arena online (52:57 - 53:02)
is the same thing it's like no i have (52:59 - 53:05)
this card i pulled it and i can't (53:02 - 53:07)
tell you (53:05 - 53:09)
that i have it and some of these cards (53:07 - 53:12)
are like 50 60 bucks (53:09 - 53:15)
and then i would have to pay more money (53:12 - 53:17)
in (53:15 - 53:20)
your app to be able like in arena you (53:17 - 53:23)
can craft it but i have to pay to be (53:20 - 53:25)
able to craft it even though i have it (53:23 - 53:27)
it's like still one of the biggest (53:25 - 53:30)
disconnects for me about what what turns (53:27 - 53:31)
me off of (53:30 - 53:33)
of trying to do it both like i would (53:31 - 53:35)
probably end up playing trading card (53:33 - 53:37)
game live (53:35 - 53:40)
but i would then never play paper (53:37 - 53:42)
right because i don't want to be paying (53:40 - 53:44)
for things twice (53:42 - 53:44)
sure (53:44 - 53:47)
i don't want this experience of i have a (53:44 - 53:50)
thing in my hand (53:47 - 53:52)
and i have a thing online and they're (53:50 - 53:54)
the same thing but i can't use them i (53:52 - 53:57)
would i would say with like (53:54 - 53:59)
ptcgo (53:57 - 54:02)
or even like games like apex or pokemon (53:59 - 54:03)
unite (54:02 - 54:05)
at a certain point you just you're no (54:03 - 54:07)
longer playing catch-up (54:05 - 54:09)
like (54:07 - 54:11)
if if you if you were if you were (54:09 - 54:12)
getting (54:11 - 54:15)
100 200 booster packs at whether the (54:12 - 54:16)
real booster packs or you just were (54:15 - 54:18)
buying code cards online (54:16 - 54:21)
you usually had so much (54:18 - 54:23)
in your inventory for trading power (54:21 - 54:25)
and at that point if you're that kind of (54:23 - 54:26)
player you probably understood how the (54:25 - 54:28)
trading board worked (54:26 - 54:29)
that you probably wouldn't have to worry (54:28 - 54:31)
about like cards you're missing like you (54:29 - 54:32)
you would have just so many (54:31 - 54:35)
um and the same thing for like apex or (54:32 - 54:37)
unite like if you grinded out your (54:35 - 54:39)
currency (54:37 - 54:40)
you probably will never have to buy (54:39 - 54:42)
another character again like by the time (54:40 - 54:43)
a new character comes out you will just (54:42 - 54:45)
have enough currency to unlock it for (54:43 - 54:47)
free and never have to worry about like (54:45 - 54:49)
giving the game money the people who do (54:47 - 54:51)
have to like your example greg which i (54:49 - 54:52)
totally get are like the people who like (54:51 - 54:54)
step away from a game for a while and (54:52 - 54:55)
they come back and they're like oh i (54:54 - 54:57)
gotta play catch up and where do i start (54:55 - 54:58)
where do i go (54:57 - 54:59)
um what do i have to do to get this (54:58 - 55:00)
currency (54:59 - 55:02)
uh (55:00 - 55:05)
so i i hope with live that feels (55:02 - 55:08)
better but i again like if if i was (55:05 - 55:09)
playing hearthstone for six months and (55:08 - 55:12)
then i walked away and for two years and (55:09 - 55:13)
then i come back i'm sure all those (55:12 - 55:15)
cards are garbage i'm sure if i broke (55:13 - 55:17)
them all down into crafting materials i (55:15 - 55:18)
could barely buy anything that's (55:17 - 55:20)
currently good so like i don't know i (55:18 - 55:21)
don't even know where to start if i was (55:20 - 55:24)
to come back to hearthstone like i (55:21 - 55:25)
i think they even i think they have (55:24 - 55:27)
season passes in that game too i guess (55:25 - 55:29)
you buy that and like i don't do that i (55:27 - 55:30)
don't remember i haven't played arizona (55:29 - 55:32)
in a very long time i mean but things (55:30 - 55:35)
like hearthstone (55:32 - 55:37)
that really only have an online presence (55:35 - 55:39)
i can accept that better because like i (55:37 - 55:41)
walked away (55:39 - 55:43)
but (55:41 - 55:43)
if i walked away to play the paper (55:43 - 55:48)
version and then because of world events (55:45 - 55:51)
i went back it frustrates me that (55:48 - 55:52)
there's no way to say (55:51 - 55:55)
i have been supporting you (55:52 - 55:58)
in irl terms and paper terms (55:55 - 56:01)
still for the last five years (55:58 - 56:04)
and that is meaningless for your online (56:01 - 56:07)
version i i (56:04 - 56:09)
i don't know the solution to that but it (56:07 - 56:10)
is (56:09 - 56:13)
a continual frustration i have of mine (56:10 - 56:14)
of (56:13 - 56:17)
card games that have both an online and (56:14 - 56:20)
a physical presence (56:17 - 56:20)
well ptc shutdown uh the the pokemon (56:21 - 56:26)
trading card (56:24 - 56:29)
game online will sunset just prior to (56:26 - 56:31)
the launch of the trading card game live (56:29 - 56:33)
more information will be shared soon (56:31 - 56:34)
they said this is supposed to come out (56:33 - 56:36)
this year so (56:34 - 56:37)
my guess would be the same weekend as (56:36 - 56:38)
diamond and pearl there will also be a (56:37 - 56:40)
community day event there there will (56:38 - 56:41)
also be a new masters event that will be (56:40 - 56:43)
limited to 48 hours and there will also (56:41 - 56:45)
be i'm sure a raid event and sword and (56:43 - 56:46)
shield they'll do it all in the same (56:45 - 56:48)
weekend and then (56:46 - 56:51)
it's how janine wants it she likes to (56:48 - 56:54)
schedule her stuff all at the same time (56:51 - 56:57)
pokemon weekend transferring accounts (56:54 - 56:59)
existing pokemon tcg online players will (56:57 - 57:01)
be easily able to transfer their (56:59 - 57:04)
accounts and game data to tcg live upon (57:01 - 57:05)
release (57:04 - 57:07)
additional information including exact (57:05 - 57:09)
timing account migration will be shared (57:07 - 57:11)
soon (57:09 - 57:14)
um how do i transfer my account (57:11 - 57:16)
uh they will both use the pokemon (57:14 - 57:19)
trainer club account service for login (57:16 - 57:22)
uh when logging into ptc gli for the (57:19 - 57:24)
first time ever any tcg online (57:22 - 57:26)
collection data will be automatically (57:24 - 57:28)
transferred (57:26 - 57:31)
um (57:28 - 57:31)
is everything from my ptcg online (57:33 - 57:37)
account transferable what about my cards (57:35 - 57:38)
okay this is where it gets a little (57:37 - 57:40)
weird again (57:38 - 57:42)
tcg cards from sword and shield series (57:40 - 57:45)
as well as select sun and moon series (57:42 - 57:47)
expansions from sun and moon lost (57:45 - 57:48)
thunder through sun and moon cosmic (57:47 - 57:51)
eclipse are transferable and playable at (57:48 - 57:53)
launch so that matches up currently with (57:51 - 57:55)
the current format (57:53 - 57:58)
cards in the sun and moon expansion (57:55 - 57:59)
which is sun and moon (57:58 - 58:02)
through dragon's majesty as well as x (57:59 - 58:03)
and y and black and white are (58:02 - 58:07)
transferable but are not playable (58:03 - 58:10)
so you can play those cards anyways in (58:07 - 58:12)
standard those cards were playable in (58:10 - 58:13)
expanded (58:12 - 58:16)
but expanded they're not getting rid of (58:13 - 58:19)
it just won't be available at launch (58:16 - 58:22)
but they said expanded will be coming (58:19 - 58:24)
players will be able to transfer up to (58:22 - 58:26)
four copies of a card (58:24 - 58:28)
one copy of an a spec card one copy of a (58:26 - 58:30)
prison card (58:28 - 58:33)
one copy of each v union card (58:30 - 58:38)
and 59 copies of energy (58:33 - 58:38)
we don't know if the hollow energy (58:39 - 58:42)
transfers hope hopefully they do i'm (58:40 - 58:44)
assuming (58:42 - 58:47)
many coins card sleeves deck boxes are (58:44 - 58:49)
transferable with a maximum of one copy (58:47 - 58:52)
per item additional copies of coins card (58:49 - 58:53)
sleeves deck boxes will not be (58:52 - 58:55)
transferable (58:53 - 58:57)
uh (58:55 - 58:57)
the (58:58 - 59:02)
tcg online players will not be able to (58:59 - 59:04)
transfer the following content cards (59:02 - 59:07)
from heart gold soul silver series this (59:04 - 59:09)
is when tcgo online started with our (59:07 - 59:11)
gold soul silver (59:09 - 59:12)
that's actually when i got back into the (59:11 - 59:14)
game (59:12 - 59:16)
avatar items unopened products and (59:14 - 59:18)
bundles (59:16 - 59:20)
certain coins card sleeves deck boxes (59:18 - 59:22)
in-game currency your friends list (59:20 - 59:25)
cannot transfer your save deck list will (59:22 - 59:27)
not transfer although you can export (59:25 - 59:29)
them to a text file (59:27 - 59:30)
and then copy and paste that text file (59:29 - 59:32)
into the new app (59:30 - 59:33)
which is (59:32 - 59:36)
really useful to make decks (59:33 - 59:38)
while unopened (59:36 - 59:40)
products and bundles are not (59:38 - 59:41)
transferable players will receive a (59:40 - 59:43)
number of crystals (59:41 - 59:46)
in tcg live that is proportional to the (59:43 - 59:49)
number of unopened packs crystals can (59:46 - 59:50)
then be redeemed for booster packs promo (59:49 - 59:54)
cards or special bundles (59:50 - 59:54)
i believe it doesn't say here but i (59:54 - 59:58)
believe you can do (59:56 - 60:01)
125 booster packs (59:58 - 60:05)
that so if you have 125 unopened booster (60:01 - 60:07)
packs that will transfer to (60:05 - 60:10)
crystals when the game comes out if you (60:07 - 60:14)
have more than 125 it will only take 125 (60:10 - 60:16)
so what people are doing i'm gonna i'm (60:14 - 60:18)
gonna spoil it for everyone i'm gonna (60:16 - 60:20)
ruin the market here (60:18 - 60:22)
is they're going to ebay (60:20 - 60:24)
and they're buying (60:22 - 60:27)
code cards for crimson invasion because (60:24 - 60:30)
it is no joke the worst set ever and you (60:27 - 60:33)
can get a hundred code cards of crimson (60:30 - 60:36)
invasion for about six bucks (60:33 - 60:39)
and that will transfer to (60:36 - 60:42)
and don't open them you just redeem them (60:39 - 60:44)
and then when the game comes out those (60:42 - 60:46)
booster packs will transfer to the new (60:44 - 60:48)
booster packs in the new game (60:46 - 60:50)
so you can take (60:48 - 60:52)
for six dollars you can get a hundred (60:50 - 60:55)
garbage booster packs and then ideally (60:52 - 60:56)
when the new game comes out you'll be (60:55 - 60:58)
able to trade those for current well you (60:56 - 61:00)
get all the curt you get the crystals (60:58 - 61:01)
and then you'll be able to use the (61:00 - 61:03)
crystals but what's gonna happen is that (61:01 - 61:06)
transfer crystals won't be as good as (61:03 - 61:08)
uh bright blue crystals which are the (61:06 - 61:10)
ones that you buy directly and therefore (61:08 - 61:12)
one chance for christmas if we have the (61:10 - 61:15)
currency here we have that so but (61:12 - 61:17)
is it gonna be like a one for one like (61:15 - 61:19)
no is it so (61:17 - 61:21)
you could have a is it possible that you (61:19 - 61:22)
have a hundred of the bad packs and (61:21 - 61:25)
they're like well those are only worth (61:22 - 61:26)
three (61:25 - 61:28)
crystals and the no (61:26 - 61:31)
packs are five crystals no no no the the (61:28 - 61:33)
pokemon trading card game online (61:31 - 61:36)
all packs are 200 coins yes whether (61:33 - 61:38)
whether they're good or not if evolving (61:36 - 61:40)
skies just came out 200 (61:38 - 61:43)
crimson invasion still able to buy 200. (61:40 - 61:44)
literally (61:43 - 61:47)
i i know it's a joke on the show not (61:44 - 61:49)
exaggerating crimson invasion is the (61:47 - 61:51)
worst set they have released in like the (61:49 - 61:53)
last decade (61:51 - 61:54)
but i mean i know that's how it is now (61:53 - 61:56)
but do we know if that's what it's going (61:54 - 61:58)
to be (61:56 - 62:01)
i cannot imagine that (61:58 - 62:02)
like (62:01 - 62:04)
newer booster packs would be worth more (62:02 - 62:05)
than older booster packs since they've (62:04 - 62:08)
never done that in 11 years i i mean i (62:05 - 62:10)
can imagine it because i've seen it if (62:08 - 62:12)
anything some older booster packs like (62:10 - 62:15)
dark explorers which is an incredible (62:12 - 62:17)
set that's the set that has dark patch (62:15 - 62:20)
those when they brought they would bring (62:17 - 62:22)
stable eye dark gray (62:20 - 62:23)
uh when they brought that back they (62:22 - 62:25)
would keep it at 200 coins (62:23 - 62:27)
but yeah you're right they could start (62:25 - 62:29)
changing it i don't see why they would (62:27 - 62:31)
since it seems like they're trying to (62:29 - 62:33)
make this as accessible as possible (62:31 - 62:35)
there are different currencies here uh (62:33 - 62:38)
there are three currencies there's coins (62:35 - 62:39)
which (62:38 - 62:41)
coins are technically in the current (62:39 - 62:42)
game coins can be earned by completing (62:41 - 62:44)
quests leveling up increasing your rank (62:42 - 62:46)
and more they can be exchanged for cool (62:44 - 62:49)
new apparel emotes for your avatars and (62:46 - 62:51)
deck customization like cards and (62:49 - 62:53)
sleeves or sorry card sleeves and deck (62:51 - 62:57)
boxes crystals can be completed crystals (62:53 - 63:01)
can be earned and completed uh by quest (62:57 - 63:04)
by unlocking tears on a battle pass they (63:01 - 63:05)
can be exchanged in the shop for booster (63:04 - 63:06)
packs (63:05 - 63:09)
uh and special bundles (63:06 - 63:11)
or they can be converted into coins (63:09 - 63:13)
crystals can also be exchanged for the (63:11 - 63:15)
premium pass (63:13 - 63:16)
which increases the rewards for (63:15 - 63:19)
completing battle pass tiers (63:16 - 63:20)
credits (63:19 - 63:22)
are when a player receives a card they (63:20 - 63:24)
already own four of except for a spec or (63:22 - 63:27)
prism which you can only have one of (63:24 - 63:28)
credits will (63:27 - 63:31)
take extra copies and convert them (63:28 - 63:34)
more credits earned on converting a card (63:31 - 63:35)
is rare (63:34 - 63:38)
so like i would assume like a rare card (63:35 - 63:39)
would give you more credits than a (63:38 - 63:42)
common card obviously (63:39 - 63:44)
uh credits can also be earned by (63:42 - 63:46)
completing daily quests in the battle (63:44 - 63:49)
pass tiers exchanging crystals for some (63:46 - 63:50)
items in the shop credits can be (63:49 - 63:53)
exchanged for any card in the deck (63:50 - 63:54)
editor (63:53 - 63:55)
um so (63:54 - 63:58)
credits directly buy a single using (63:55 - 64:01)
credit credits are ultimately dust in (63:58 - 64:03)
hearthstone (64:01 - 64:04)
because when you crush a card in (64:03 - 64:07)
hearthstone (64:04 - 64:07)
crystals are (64:07 - 64:10)
for booster packs (64:11 - 64:16)
and then coins are for (64:14 - 64:20)
like deck like customization stuff (64:16 - 64:21)
but you can't give the game you can't (64:20 - 64:24)
give this game money (64:21 - 64:27)
so i'm confused (64:24 - 64:30)
of the battle pass (64:27 - 64:30)
because usually battle passes are like (64:30 - 64:34)
10 bucks for a season and (64:32 - 64:36)
well does it say that you can't buy the (64:34 - 64:39)
battle pass yeah it says free to play (64:36 - 64:40)
without any in-app purchase was the (64:39 - 64:44)
first bullet point here (64:40 - 64:44)
so i'm is the i guess the battle pass (64:44 - 64:47)
would just be free and then if you want (64:46 - 64:50)
to accelerate the battle pass (64:47 - 64:51)
you can (64:50 - 64:53)
give crystals to accelerate the battle (64:51 - 64:54)
pass (64:53 - 64:56)
but we also don't know like if you but (64:54 - 64:58)
so here's the thing if you buy a booster (64:56 - 65:00)
pack (64:58 - 65:02)
are they when you're redeeming the (65:00 - 65:03)
booster pack (65:02 - 65:05)
are you redeeming it for a crystal and (65:03 - 65:06)
then you're exchanging the crystal for (65:05 - 65:08)
booster pack are you redeeming the (65:06 - 65:10)
booster pack for booster pack (65:08 - 65:13)
because when ptc geo first came out (65:10 - 65:16)
you would redeem the a lot of (65:13 - 65:17)
you would so when i was redeeming like (65:16 - 65:21)
dark explorers or emerging powers in the (65:17 - 65:23)
online game (65:21 - 65:25)
it would let me use that to buy any (65:23 - 65:27)
booster pack i wanted (65:25 - 65:29)
so i wouldn't want to buy more emerging (65:27 - 65:30)
powers because that set was garbage i (65:29 - 65:32)
would want to buy more dark explorers (65:30 - 65:34)
and then at a certain point when you (65:32 - 65:36)
redeemed it it would be one-to-one (65:34 - 65:37)
you're redeeming evolving skies you're (65:36 - 65:39)
getting evolving skies you're redeeming (65:37 - 65:41)
noble victors you're getting noble (65:39 - 65:42)
victors but when they first started off (65:41 - 65:44)
it wasn't like that (65:42 - 65:47)
so i don't know if they're going back to (65:44 - 65:50)
you redeem a booster pack (65:47 - 65:51)
and (65:50 - 65:53)
you get a crystal or you redeem a (65:51 - 65:54)
booster pack and you get a booster pack (65:53 - 65:55)
i would assume you get the same booster (65:54 - 65:57)
pack but then where are the crystals (65:55 - 65:59)
coming from besides like leveling up (65:57 - 66:01)
your battle pass but if you're (65:59 - 66:03)
needing crystals to also level i don't (66:01 - 66:04)
know it seems (66:03 - 66:08)
everyone just have to find out over time (66:04 - 66:10)
uh i just don't get why they wouldn't (66:08 - 66:12)
want like (66:10 - 66:13)
why not just have it like five bucks for (66:12 - 66:16)
a battle pass what's the problem here (66:13 - 66:18)
like you already have unite you have (66:16 - 66:21)
masters you have pogo (66:18 - 66:23)
what is the problem with somebody paying (66:21 - 66:24)
five bucks for a battle pass what is (66:23 - 66:27)
that first bullet point again (66:24 - 66:29)
the first bullet point is free to play (66:27 - 66:34)
without any in-app purchase (66:29 - 66:34)
uh yeah i think there's wiggle room just (66:34 - 66:38)
to say (66:37 - 66:42)
there may be in-app purchases yeah but (66:38 - 66:45)
in-app purchases aren't necessary ever (66:42 - 66:47)
to (66:45 - 66:47)
without any in-app purchases required (66:48 - 66:53)
required but (66:51 - 66:54)
i think that's what they're saying (66:53 - 66:57)
available i think that will be available (66:54 - 66:59)
um (66:57 - 67:02)
because because everything else strongly (66:59 - 67:04)
suggests that there's going to be some (67:02 - 67:06)
sort of in-app yeah (67:04 - 67:09)
so i think their first thing is you (67:06 - 67:11)
never have like the same with unite you (67:09 - 67:13)
never have to buy anything to play the (67:11 - 67:15)
game (67:13 - 67:18)
right like you can play (67:15 - 67:20)
usually they just say like usually they (67:18 - 67:21)
just say like free to play or free to (67:20 - 67:23)
start and then they move on yeah and (67:21 - 67:25)
then you go like okay (67:23 - 67:27)
i mean the intern thought that they were (67:25 - 67:30)
gonna make the language better make it (67:27 - 67:32)
fancier and they just used the wrong (67:30 - 67:34)
words they put too many words in there (67:32 - 67:37)
they put too many words in it i i (67:34 - 67:37)
yeah i think there is going to i think (67:38 - 67:41)
there's going to be in-app purchases (67:40 - 67:44)
like i feel there's wiggle room in that (67:41 - 67:46)
statement (67:44 - 67:47)
can you buy the battle pass and unite (67:46 - 67:49)
without spending money (67:47 - 67:50)
you have to spend money right you have (67:49 - 67:52)
to spend money you have to use jobs yeah (67:50 - 67:54)
you can't earn you can't earn gems (67:52 - 67:59)
randomly you have to buy them yep (67:54 - 67:59)
huh (67:59 - 68:02)
the other the last thing here is the (68:04 - 68:08)
current market (68:06 - 68:13)
for ptco is completely in shambles (68:08 - 68:15)
because of this announcement (68:13 - 68:16)
because (68:15 - 68:17)
yeah (68:16 - 68:20)
uh nothing like people like (68:17 - 68:22)
you you can only have four of a card so (68:20 - 68:24)
if you're holding on to like (68:22 - 68:26)
20 full art cynthia (68:24 - 68:28)
and cynthia's worth a lot or was worth a (68:26 - 68:29)
lot i don't know if she's worth anything (68:28 - 68:30)
anymore back in the day she was like (68:29 - 68:33)
worth 64 booster packs or whatever (68:30 - 68:36)
like you're better off trying to unload (68:33 - 68:39)
those cynthias for cards you're missing (68:36 - 68:41)
but also everyone else is trying to (68:39 - 68:44)
unload cards wait i thought you got (68:41 - 68:46)
one of them for all your extras (68:44 - 68:50)
you so if if you have four if you have (68:46 - 68:51)
20 cynthia's they will only transfer (68:50 - 68:53)
four of the cynthia's and the other 16 (68:51 - 68:55)
cynthias are gone they're guarding you (68:53 - 68:58)
credit nope for oh (68:55 - 69:00)
why did i hear that the wrong way (68:58 - 69:02)
so what you could do (69:00 - 69:04)
so let's say let's say you have a lot of (69:02 - 69:05)
like really decent car let's say you (69:04 - 69:08)
have 20 cynthia's 20 full arts cynthia's (69:05 - 69:10)
what you could do just give them to a (69:08 - 69:12)
friend (69:10 - 69:12)
like if you can't trade them or if (69:12 - 69:16)
you're you can't (69:14 - 69:18)
like it is probably better for you to be (69:16 - 69:21)
like hey will i'm going to lose these so (69:18 - 69:23)
i might as well give them to you so you (69:21 - 69:24)
have them in your collection because (69:23 - 69:26)
they're they're literally useless to me (69:24 - 69:28)
or if you like for deck boxes or coins (69:26 - 69:30)
like there are some really (69:28 - 69:32)
rare and expensive coins and deck boxes (69:30 - 69:34)
especially if you went to like a worlds (69:32 - 69:37)
2012 or worlds 2013 if you have like (69:34 - 69:40)
four of those deck boxes (69:37 - 69:40)
like trade them to somebody because (69:40 - 69:45)
they're going to be gone (69:43 - 69:48)
um like i think i think i have like (69:45 - 69:50)
three sets of coins where i have like (69:48 - 69:51)
two of each and they're they're pretty (69:50 - 69:52)
like i don't know valuable i don't know (69:51 - 69:54)
they're worth like 20 booster packs they (69:52 - 69:58)
were worth 20 booster packs (69:54 - 70:00)
for the booster pack bubble burst (69:58 - 70:02)
um (70:00 - 70:04)
but anyways (70:02 - 70:06)
this is super exciting they're like (70:04 - 70:08)
doing it yes (70:06 - 70:10)
something you've asked for for years (70:08 - 70:12)
it's fine (70:10 - 70:13)
i'm (70:12 - 70:15)
curious how the details will play out (70:13 - 70:18)
but i think it's a good thing (70:15 - 70:21)
i hope it meets (70:18 - 70:23)
90 percent of what everybody wants from (70:21 - 70:25)
it (70:23 - 70:25)
i hope it's good uh (70:25 - 70:30)
well it can't be bad because they (70:28 - 70:32)
obviously listen to the show and they're (70:30 - 70:34)
like steve would have never played this (70:32 - 70:36)
game if it was horizontal on the iphone (70:34 - 70:38)
so we're gonna make sure that you can (70:36 - 70:40)
play it both horizontal and vertical on (70:38 - 70:42)
the iphone and i was like gonna happen (70:40 - 70:46)
no you can't play it both ways dang (70:42 - 70:47)

caterpie on the bench is doing i don't (71:03 - 71:07)

late (79:44 - 79:46)
too (79:45 - 79:47)
late they should have done a little bit (79:46 - 79:50)
more earlier this year i agree yeah it (79:47 - 79:52)
should have been spaced out instead of (79:50 - 79:54)
oops (79:52 - 79:56)
all anniversary events in the last two (79:54 - 79:58)
months of the year i i will say i'm a (79:56 - 80:00)
little worried that the tcg will be very (79:58 - 80:02)
close to diamond and pearl (80:00 - 80:03)
but like they probably could have fit (80:02 - 80:05)
the tc they probably could have fit the (80:03 - 80:09)
tcg in between snap and (80:05 - 80:10)
unite (80:09 - 80:14)
unites only 60 days old so right (80:10 - 80:15)
i mean they could (80:14 - 80:18)
it's sometime this year it could be (80:15 - 80:20)
december when we get that out uh maybe (80:18 - 80:22)
december's better (80:20 - 80:24)
but the problem with december is we get (80:22 - 80:27)
diamond pearl in november yeah (80:24 - 80:30)
and then we get legends and jitty ware (80:27 - 80:31)
yes (80:30 - 80:33)
the end of january (80:31 - 80:36)
yeah it just it feels very tight (80:33 - 80:37)
as somebody who likes all aspects of (80:36 - 80:38)
pokemon it feels tight if you don't care (80:37 - 80:42)
about the tcg then whatever (80:38 - 80:45)
easy to easy to move on (80:42 - 80:46)

of (81:49 - 81:51)

my style very simple classic american (82:02 - 82:07)
of the weird (82:09 - 82:12)

i mean i like the t-shirts from galler (82:22 - 82:25)
that have like all the different pokemon (82:24 - 82:27)
on them doing stuff (82:25 - 82:29)

mischief maker that has (82:29 - 82:34)
uh impedimps in the flowers (82:31 - 82:35)

and there's like a i think like a just a (82:51 - 82:55)
general dinosaur one (82:53 - 82:56)
there's no such thing as a general (82:55 - 82:58)
dinosaur in the pokemon world it (82:56 - 83:00)
reflects something (82:58 - 83:03)
it's like um it's like green i think i (83:00 - 83:07)
think it's super nerd super nerd pokemon (83:03 - 83:08)
well because super nerd is a trainer (83:07 - 83:11)
class but there is (83:08 - 83:11)
i know the one that you're talking about (83:14 - 83:17)

uh references to the particular pokemon (87:34 - 87:40)
of the week um from clue number one it (87:37 - 87:42)
occupied spot zero zero one in the (87:40 - 87:44)
coastal kalos pokedex you knew that it's (87:42 - 87:46)
not an evolution because why would they (87:44 - 87:49)
start with something in evolution that's (87:46 - 87:49)
fine (87:49 - 87:51)
um (87:49 - 87:52)
i mentioned that it's part of the (87:51 - 87:54)
amorphous egg group which it shares with (87:52 - 87:56)
miss drivas which is a ghost type but it (87:54 - 87:58)
doesn't share with other cousins meaning (87:56 - 88:01)
that there are no flying types in the (87:58 - 88:03)
amorphous egg group (88:01 - 88:04)
uh (88:03 - 88:06)
fluctuating level rate i mean if you (88:04 - 88:08)
know about the different leveling rates (88:06 - 88:10)
for the different pokemon that might (88:08 - 88:13)
have helped you it has no footprint only (88:10 - 88:16)
hands meaning it has no feet there you (88:13 - 88:17)
go (88:16 - 88:18)
uh (88:17 - 88:20)
made of reference to npc appearance in (88:18 - 88:22)
pokemon stadium 2 stage a super smash (88:20 - 88:24)
brothers ball if you ever played that (88:22 - 88:27)
game then i made references to its (88:24 - 88:30)
pokedex entries and its fondness for (88:27 - 88:31)
children where it's either trying to (88:30 - 88:33)
befriend one (88:31 - 88:34)
or (88:33 - 88:36)
abduct one (88:34 - 88:38)
um and in pokemon snap since there are (88:36 - 88:41)
no children it's trying to abduct (88:38 - 88:44)
another pokemon and finally it is a hat (88:41 - 88:47)
wearing pokemon (88:44 - 88:47)
there you go (88:47 - 88:50)
pinnacle (88:51 - 88:55)
[Laughter] (88:52 - 88:56)

drifloon binocle does not wear a hat (88:56 - 89:03)

this oh it's the eyes that freak people (89:08 - 89:11)
out (89:10 - 89:14)
it's very pan's labyrinth (89:11 - 89:16)
that was a good movie (89:14 - 89:18)
i only will ever watch it once because i (89:16 - 89:20)
don't want to go through the emotional (89:18 - 89:21)
labor of watching it again it's an (89:20 - 89:23)
excellent move well you don't like (89:21 - 89:26)
horrors no which is why i still mystery (89:23 - 89:30)
over your husband but sure (89:26 - 89:30)
he loves horrors he does (89:30 - 89:36)
opposite the track (89:33 - 89:40)
[Laughter] (89:36 - 89:42)
tripling was the first gen 4 pokemon to (89:40 - 89:44)
be revealed in super smash brothers (89:42 - 89:45)
brawl (89:44 - 89:47)
in the japanese version of pearl's (89:45 - 89:49)
pokedex entry driftwood specifically (89:47 - 89:53)
takes children to the world of the dead (89:49 - 89:55)
trying to steal them away in the english (89:53 - 89:57)
version however in the release of super (89:55 - 89:58)
smash brothers brawl (89:57 - 90:00)
the description along with driftloon's (89:58 - 90:02)
trophy states that it is taking children (90:00 - 90:04)
to the underworld (90:02 - 90:06)
driftloon shares its category with iggly (90:04 - 90:09)
buff jigglypuff wigglytuff and quillfish (90:06 - 90:11)
they're all known as the balloon pokemon (90:09 - 90:14)
uh drifloon is the only drifloon and its (90:11 - 90:16)
evolved form are the only pokemon not (90:14 - 90:19)
introduced in gen 3 to be found in the (90:16 - 90:21)
fluctuating (90:19 - 90:23)
experience group (90:21 - 90:25)
they're also the only flying and ghost (90:23 - 90:27)
type pokemon in the fluctuating (90:25 - 90:28)
experience group (90:27 - 90:29)
um (90:28 - 90:32)
i feel like world of the dead and the (90:29 - 90:35)
underworld is just (90:32 - 90:38)
splitting hairs yeah splitting hairs uh (90:35 - 90:39)
shiny (90:38 - 90:41)
i really do like the driftwood shiny it (90:39 - 90:44)
is very good is that the golden one yes (90:41 - 90:47)
the golden one nice very cute (90:44 - 90:51)
also great shuffle icon (90:47 - 90:51)
i (90:51 - 90:54)
is that a hat i always thought it was (90:54 - 90:57)
hair (90:56 - 91:01)
nah balloons don't have hair (90:57 - 91:02)
pokemon have hair it's got a little (91:01 - 91:06)
cloud hat is that it's clouds yeah but i (91:02 - 91:08)
always thought it was hair not a hat do (91:06 - 91:10)
you think he could brush it (91:08 - 91:12)
it's got hands (91:10 - 91:14)
yeah (91:12 - 91:16)
you think you could style it yeah that's (91:14 - 91:17)
going to be the who's oh you know (91:16 - 91:19)
speaking about clothes (91:17 - 91:22)
pokemon unites ruined pokemon for me (91:19 - 91:24)
you put a venusaur in a suit (91:22 - 91:25)
and then you take venusaur out of the (91:24 - 91:28)
suit and you're like what (91:25 - 91:31)
okay here do you dress (91:28 - 91:34)
your cats in clothes (91:31 - 91:36)
no (91:34 - 91:36)
so yeah but i would imagine if i put my (91:37 - 91:41)
cat in a (91:39 - 91:43)
gangsta suit or whatever venus are (91:41 - 91:46)
swearing at you tonight (91:43 - 91:48)
and then he's wearing it for a while and (91:46 - 91:50)
i take my cat out of the suit and then (91:48 - 91:52)
i'd be like uh you don't have clothes on (91:50 - 91:54)
anymore (91:52 - 91:55)
and (91:54 - 91:57)
and (91:55 - 91:57)
it's very it's weird looking at venusaur (91:57 - 92:00)
with no clothes on anymore that's what (91:59 - 92:02)
i'm saying (92:00 - 92:05)
it is natural for venusaur to not be (92:02 - 92:07)
wearing clothes yes and (92:05 - 92:08)
you're (92:07 - 92:11)
shaming of their free (92:08 - 92:14)
and aerated body (92:11 - 92:16)
has no place in this pod the venusaurian (92:14 - 92:19)
body is not gross (92:16 - 92:20)
correct (92:19 - 92:22)
these are the venusaurian bodies (92:20 - 92:24)
beautiful (92:22 - 92:25)
yeah (92:24 - 92:28)
all frogs do (92:25 - 92:28)
all right on that note let me (92:28 - 92:33)
hurry up this week's pokemon (92:30 - 92:34)
murder (92:33 - 92:36)
basically (92:34 - 92:38)
while researching this week's pokemon i (92:36 - 92:40)
came across this interesting snippet (92:38 - 92:43)
from wikipedia in place of the pokemon's (92:40 - 92:47)
name i will use the name brian (92:43 - 92:52)
jaber or jesus bear de brian (92:47 - 92:53)
count of i (92:52 - 92:58)
and of brian circa 1000 to circa 1040. (92:53 - 93:01)
was an influential nobleman in the (92:58 - 93:05)
dukey of normandy in northern france (93:01 - 93:07)
he was one of the early guardians of (93:05 - 93:10)
duke william ii in his minority and a (93:07 - 93:13)
first cousin to william's father duke (93:10 - 93:14)
robert (93:13 - 93:16)
had lord brian not been murdered the (93:14 - 93:19)
senior house of declare would probably (93:16 - 93:23)
have been titled de bryan lord brian was (93:19 - 93:26)
the first to be known by the cognoman (93:23 - 93:28)
crispin because of his hairstyle which (93:26 - 93:30)
stood up like the branches of a pine (93:28 - 93:32)
tree (93:30 - 93:35)
it is also intriguing to me that brian (93:32 - 93:37)
is one of the only one of only two (93:35 - 93:40)
mammalian species to be featured as (93:37 - 93:42)
starters for this type which started (93:40 - 93:44)
with reptiles but also includes (93:42 - 93:48)
amphibians and birds but no fish yet (93:44 - 93:51)
even with the lack of fish brian's (93:48 - 93:53)
family line are the only ones that could (93:51 - 93:55)
technically technically be said to have (93:53 - 93:57)
finn-like appendages (93:55 - 93:59)
i had originally thought of selecting (93:57 - 94:01)
