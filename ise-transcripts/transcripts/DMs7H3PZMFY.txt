[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 419th episode of the pokemon podcast last episode of july i think coming out after your go fest weekend i can't believe go fest was so amazing they gave us 10 shiny mew it was incredible i i can't even i can't even formulate into words what an incredible weekend this morning i'm surprised you only got 10. i mean you must not have been trying hard enough don't tell him what we got yeah okay my name is host we're actually recording this before go fest because we'll will is going to be out of town i said don't blame it on me blame it on cole mccune that's true uh will here greg here yeah i'm i'm going to be sad this entire episode because it is now official as of the date of the publication of this program that of all the podcasts that i co-host i am the only person who is not married oh and heck i've only had one date since like 2013. so this is things are not looking bright anyways listen to my if you enjoy the bitter taste of tears like angostura bitters in your drink enjoy the the the delicious flavor of my tears throughout this program all right we got a show for you guys today no no clue how uh go fest went or happened i'm sure it'd be fine this is what their fourth one they've done millions of communities they've done the genesect thing they did the other things i'm sure it'll be fine i'm sure and you know what's nice is they don't have to worry about any kind of mobile signal access not their problem this year the only people that have to worry are people from new zealand because they go first that's really what it comes down to it is 10 hours both days uh from 10 a.m to 8 p.m both days saturday sunday i was actually saying this on my twitch stream i don't know who's dedicating all 20 hours of a 48-hour period i'm sure i'm sure plenty of people are uh definitely we hope it doesn't take up too much of your time as somebody who's actually gone to go fest at a certain point your body wants to give up faster than you do all that walking especially if you're playing outside in the sun but i suppose there are a bunch of people who might be playing at home or might be playing in their car where it's air conditioned so i will say i'm very sad that we won't be seeing like all of the listeners and everybody that we usually get to see get together at go fest that's that's a big disappointment for me you know those are always next year unless things get old wow let's not let's not plan that far out and get the heartbreak it's already pretty much that we aren't going to worlds speaking of heartbreak we got a heartbreaking news article to start off with oh great what is depression central this is why we don't do this on wednesdays yeah we're not not even halfway through the week all right here we go pokemon rumble rush service ending what july 21st to yep i'll tell you why wait that means it's already ended it ended yesterday yeah it's because it's a horizontal game pokemon go and pokemon masters have some words with you no they were vertical no rush was russia's vertical too was it yeah russia yeah okay the mobile game no longer available services ended rumble rush has been retired services for the mobile game have ended from this point on you cannot install it or for the first time update the app you can also not play any previous versions installed of the app additionally unused diamonds can no longer be used or redeemed thank you for enjoying pokemon rumble rush that was off pokemon.com that is so um what is the word like disingenuous because nobody enjoyed that game there is probably a person a person one person with the yes rumble rush fanatic i think i installed the game i think i mean you install a lot of things buddy that's true the question is did i open it i don't think i did i think you did on at one point i'm pretty sure you did i just i don't think ambrella makes good games i can't get into that debate again but there's no debate i mean they just don't there's not a game under there's not a game under their umbrella that they've they've made that was good well but now that they've been bought out by 10 cent i'm sure they'll start improving their production yeah that is not true they have not been bought by 10 cent yet yet i know it's like everybody's going to get bought by 10 at some point in time that's i mean that's it that's it for rumble rush uh i know there was like a shaymin event last week they did to like save farewell i guess i'm not in a position where i'm playing a game that is ending so i don't know what that feels like rips your heart right out of your chest buddy yeah like by the time destiny ended destiny 2 was no no no no i'm sorry destiny is a 10-year game that's what my friend told me when he convinced me to buy the ps4 specifically to pay a 10-year game we played three of those 10 years what year are we in that we would have been i don't know we are like in year seven they could have been in the home stretch at this point in time if they hadn't given up speaking of mobile games i wasn't giving up pokemon masters full of disclosure i am partnered with dna i do want to go on the record that i am unhappy did they nerf super course egg drops and i just i'm unaware yeah i think they did are they only doing the bug eggs and nothing else i mean it could be that it's locked into the bug egg course because they want you to do the bug egg course because i have gotten an egg every time i've done a repeat bug course so it's possible that they just want that i don't know like they if they did that shouldn't they tell us yeah i think yes i still like doing my super courses mostly for the eggs i mean the rewards are fine but i do like the egg mechanic anyways this gets to the egg stuff that is happening in masters is up pokemon.com as well hatch scyther pincer and more during the pokemon masters bug type egg event i do think this event is good pokemon masters players may start feeling a bit bugged while hatching eggs that's because a special bug uh type egg event is on the way from now until august 2nd you can win an event you can win a an event battle to receive an egg from professor bellas by placing this egg inside the incubator you can hatch it into a bug type pokemon such as scyther pincer or others others as far as i know is weedle and venonat this event uh battle can be repeated and replayed for a reduced chance of obtaining bug type eggs plus there's even more buggy who wrote this there's more buggy fun with the return of your boy guzma it does say that it does say your boy guzma the five star bug type sink pair guzma and golisa pod is back again for the scout spot spotlight scout so you have another chance to scout the team skull boss on your team pokemon masters is free what they don't say in this press release is you do get a free well as of this recording an 11 day free incubator which is great unlimited use for the 11 days two incubators instead of the one you have which is nice i i can't i can't pull for guzma with with the like fancy steven stone around the corner i i gotta i gotta say yeah saving my polls to i got i got i got my boy guzma and now i'm waiting for my boy steven stevenstone summer version if you could get good you wouldn't have to worry about your pulse there you go you're not wrong you do get a higher chance of increasing the egg drops if you use bug type trainers so i think guzma is undoubtedly the best bug type sink pair yeah but i will suggest to you not to uh maybe stay away from the the sink pair with the sur skid she um don't maybe not maybe hey hold up whoo okay her ability to heal though on those when you do just fantastic that heel lets like basically she becomes a tank and so you can do whatever you want with uh goosebumps because they'll attack then you just have to hit one attack and she'll hit and she'll heal because i ever has a masculine so yes mascarine yeah i leveled i leveled her up all the way to like 100 for this event oh geez do you want to talk about which which pairs of the bug pairs are actually good because no it's well i didn't want a level one i didn't want to like pick a scyther or a pincer from the eggs because noland has a pincer he's a four-star sink pair yeah so nolan is good and guzman is good yeah so i leveled up nolan so i would suggest if you're picking just one bug type personal level up and you have what's her name vila viola viola yeah maybe put your energy into noland if you have nolan because megapincer is pretty good but the reason i didn't want to like assign my own character a pincer or scyther is because i was like well what if i get a shiny one that i want to assign that and then i want to level that up but i've had no such luck yet okay so here's the thing there are no good support type bugs there just aren't there aren't any in that in that area both noland pincer and golisapod are physical strikers which is unfortunate that they're both physical strikers but they're both they're both equal for tech literally the only tech one is viola and masquerade and they are also tier two so you're i mean your choices are so incredibly limited but at least masquerading gives you a tech a different type that's not a physical striker not that that's that important like this this event is what is not recovery or support i don't i haven't i've never loved a little bug so i don't know what he does not very much not very much i think bugsy is also strike let me look for bugsy hold on yeah bugsy is physical strike also and tier four of the tears is bad the weedles i have seem to be support that i got from eggs maybe that's what they want you to do the eggs maybe now i mean this isn't this is talking about existing pairs i don't know i haven't looked up but for existing pairs those are the ones yeah there are there is beedrill support i guess that would fill that role i don't know how good that is since it's new it's brand new i don't know that there's been a ton is there yeah there's also a tech bedroll so yeah cause the well i think the eggs unless unless it's a shiny because the chinese are are set yeah i just feel like looking at the moves tech i mean support scyther is just going to be better than weedle isn't that how it always is though they're better than wheels like we're not i mean just like because support scyther has xspeed all which is amazing and strike together which raises the attack and speed of all allied sync pairs so like those two things right there are super strong for support um fury cutter is the uh x scissor is is good um you know for two cost 50 power it's pretty good like i guess fury cutter is supposed to increase each time you use it but it starts to low it starts at nine like not going to sit and there's a 95 percent accuracy but i think x speed all and strike together are the things that make that scyther really good because support bedroll is x defense which is not great does have strike together which is good poison sting which is really weak i just think like if you're going to use one to fill in the support go try to get a support scyther some other mobile news here pokemon cafe mix also with an update i haven't played in a while which pokemon are we losing this time so i can cry some more recruit sabal pikachu exeggutor and blossom which executor i'm assuming regular because it will be right they usually say pokemon.com usually puts a lowland before a variety of new updates have arrived in cafe mix that will make your cafe more delightful than ever before new pokemon are arriving at the cafe and there's bet plenty of new stages to complete until july 29th sable will appear in your cafe as a customer if you save up your orders for sabble and strengthen your friendship during the event it will join you as staff watch out for special cat challenge cards too sable may only be found for a limited time but you can expect pikachu exeggutor and blossom to stop on your cafe by a regular bait on a regular basis like other pokemon customers serving them delicious dishes will convince them to come back and work at your cafe two new item menus have been added so your customers are bound to get a tasty treat there are 50 new orders to dish out as well along with 25 master cafe orders for expert players two new gimmicks also appeared so prepare to adjust your strategy to deal with them cafe mix is available for the nintendo switch ios and android devices what is special challenge cards oh i'm sure it's like you have to do harder stuff there are so there are cards that you have to complete certain tasks to fill them out and once you do all the tasks on the card you get you get more acorns usually or whatever i think they're acorns i don't know what they are yeah they're acorns but yeah if you fill everything out usually or sometimes like you feel it out and like sobble shows up or you know it invites one of the ones you're missing i feel like cafe mix has already gotten significantly more love in the last month than rumble rush did in the last year you are correct yes pretty much cafe mix is here to stay well cafe mix is good and it's fun yeah it is fun it's hard i don't want more gimmicks i don't need more items that mess up my gameplay yeah it certainly is a deceivingly complex game it is at those higher levels i'm like i don't know the baskets are in the middle but you put all the tomatoes on the sides in a hole how is that fair more mobile news pokemon go go battle league season three to begin monday july 27th season two of the battle league is near ending and we're excited to share what happened within the last several weeks okay sure there were a lot of changes that happened in season two trainers who reached rank 10

screen you can expect the similar end of season rewards for season 2 except that you will receive an elite fast tm instead of an elite charge tm if you reach rank 7 or higher season 3 will follow the same league rotation as season 2 and the schedule will be noted below with a notable addition the premier cup is now coming to ultra league two so great league will run july 27th to august 10th ultra league and premier cup will run august 10th to august 24th master league and premier cup will run august 24th to september 7th all three leagues and premier cup no cp limit will be available monday september 7th to september 14th season 4 will begin september 14th these dates are tentative so please be sure to keep up to date for any changes the following will stay the same in season three there

matter where they are the avatar in spot the avatar items inspired by pikachu libre will be continued at rank 7. the battles win and ratings required will remain the same what is new though more cups will be added in the addition to the ultra league premier cup we're introducing a flying cup where only flying type pokemon will be allowed the flying cup will be available during an upcoming event more details to come that actually sounds cool i'm sure it'll be nothing but altaria [Laughter] based on trainer's feedback we decided to oh and skarmory uh based on trader's feedback we decided to remove the battle until you win feature for season three your guarantee reward encounters will be different at rank one pidgeot rank four galerion zigzagoon rank 7 gallerian farfetch rank 8 rufflet rank 9 everyone's favorite flying pokemon scraggy yay although i guess zigzag's not flying pikachu if you reach rank 10 you will earn a brand new avatar pose an avatar item for the premium track rewards you will earn rare candies after your fourth win uh the number of rare candies have been reduced from eight to six trainers who finish season three at running seven or higher will get an elite charge tm uh otherwise it is the same more though additionally we have two this seems so complex for somebody who's like maybe on the fence of like getting into this like oh all of these like different leagues that you have to keep up with each league has a different meta they're doing this fly i don't know just seems like a lot additionally we have two go battle league themed events for season three be on the lookout the following existing attacks have been updated for trainers drill pack will deal more damage brave bird will deal more damage and lower the user's attack infestation is a bug type attack will generate energy more quickly hex ghost type fast attack generate energy more quickly powder snow deals more damage blizzard deals more damage flash cannon requires more energy focus blast deals less damage moon blast has a decreased chance of lowering your opponent's attack the following existing attacks have been updated for gems and raids drill peck more damage brave bird more damage hex more quickly the following type of pokemon cannot learn these attacks now they can bravery can now learn close combat obama snow can learn ice type weather ball caliper can learn water type weatherball empoleon can learn drill peck wait a minute what wait who skarmory learns close no who learned that is correct yeah bravery usually runs close combat in the video game braviary doesn't have arms hey it's not saying close combat needs arms it's saying that they're close and they're combating you it's a fighting type move no have you ever seen the animation for that thing you run in and you punch that dude have you ever seen an eagle poke out so evils are eagles evils eagles are evil they can they can do some damage agreed they i just they don't they can't punch that's the problem and if they're trying to kick they only got the two legs they're gonna fall i i i don't see how they flap in the air and claw your eyes out like it's good close is it close because it's in your face and is it combat we're fighting my face fighting spirit who do i petition to have this removed mr pokemon mr pokemon yeah is this the hill we want to die on bravery this is the hill that i want to die on yes if anybody should know close combat it's vullaby why because he's cute and he won't give him a little hug and then he's like i'm going to combat you while you're hugging me [Laughter] argue with that logic i guess i mean it is a dark type so yeah totally turn on you it's like love me this is uh off the nintendo america official twitter the fight rages on nintendo switch online members will experience the full pokemon fighting game pokken tournament dx from july 29th to august 4th you can download the trial right now what uh what a birthday present it's what you asked for i've been telling nintendo for for eons give me you have said seven free days of pokemon every s at every twitch stream on every episode how much you love fighting games i am a fighter i really love smash brothers and pokken dx i have heard it a million times and now that you get what you want you spit in its face i agree quit now fraud look if they're adding bravery with close combat for the fighting game i'm in they are no they're not no who is in this game anymore well it's not like they've added anybody i know but like i played it on the wii u i'm pretty sure and then forgot about it and didn't they add people i played it on wii u and i beat steve and that's when he stopped playing oh that's true i retired will will is the better fighting type bravery i'm pretty sure that did they have decidueye when i played it uh blastoise i think is the newest one i'm not sure what trace is in this yeah yeah it's part of the dlc is it supposed to be in this picture no it's not in the picture blastoise and one other pokemon got added i don't remember anything about look i i i'm gonna dx i'm gonna guess that this was always planned uh because worlds would have been around this time true and people probably would have watched it's really easy to watch a fighting game uh it's much easier to watch a fighting game than it is the tcg or the video game and so i'm assuming that this was always planned because people would have watched worlds they would have got suckered in to be like well it's the only thing on the big screen is pokken tournament we waiting for the next match so might as well watch it and then they go oh during the intermission they go there's a free trial on switch and you go well it's free i might as well download it um so i think this was always planned i thought i don't think this was actually out of nowhere it's just there's no world tournament to line this up with there are a lot of battlers well i mean it's a tournament there's no blast toys in this game yes there's a bully on blastoise is in the game i promise you is it in the dlc yes okay it was like a dlc 2-pack and blastoise was the second character i can't remember the first one it was a two pack oh egypt yeah it was a battle so you had to it was twenty dollars and it came with two characters so the first wave was aegis slash and then egypt support pokemon were uh mega rayquaza and mimikyu and then the second one was blastoise and then blastoise's support characters were mew and celebi that's okay i'm east coast not west coast so and it was i believe it was 1999 for the dlc for two characters jeez and i all right pretty sure people were upset about it being 20 bucks oh decidueye was added to the switch version see i didn't play just a joy that's why i didn't i didn't play this game much get your pokken tournament dx i guess i mean you can play it for free free nah i won't i think i'm alright speaking of being all right let's take a quick break when we come back we have some more news stop going to sam's club stop buying the four gallon tub of peanut butter but sam's club has some really good deals stop stop stop going to sand the 18 pounds of cream cheese is on sale [Music] the 18 pounds of cream cheese is on sale [Music] you can't eat 18 pounds of cream cheese before they expired [Music] [Music] an afternoon with evie and friends espeon from funko at the pokemon center all right i already have questions but do your thing you do your thing you let me know when it's question time all right okay we got some world-class writing with this one too you don't need to be a psychic to know that something new has arrived in the pokemon center it's espeon the latest figure of funko's an afternoon with evie and friends this monthly series of collectible highlights evie and each evolution's pokemon's multiple forms and this month's star is the psychic type pokemon true to its pokedex category the adorable sun pokemon can be seen chilling out on a rock while basking in the warm ray of the sun espeon does after all use the orb on its forehead to harness a glow of the sun in order to build up power does this pokemon's subtle smirk means mean that it's simply enjoying the serene scene or is its grand due to its growing confidence that its mental might will help it defeat its opponents that's up for you to decide or is it going to wreck your house there's a limited quality of these figures available so head over to pokemon center quality quantity limit quality yeah sometimes they're good sometimes those are probably accurate i mean you guys bought the christmas train the christmas trend was much worse than the day with pikachu figures all right is it question time yet yeah it's a question you can ask okay hit my question is why why did they have to do espeon dirty because greg you will understand this okay steve you will not understand this this is clearly the sculptor's intent is to demonstrate that espeon is narcissus staring at his reflection in the puddle and that is all he cares about and he is lost in his own reflection joyce merkin how rude espeon is a sweet lovable it gives its all for its trainer it is not self-obsessed and solipsistic i mean as long as you keep it away from a puddle you're fine but now we know it's true weakness is it's its own image scary i just the minute i saw it i was like i can't believe like are all the other afternoon with eevee like greek myths as well i don't know how do i find them you've just clicked on the link i no see i don't see it because like what flareon's like sniffing a leaf and glacion's like i made some ice where there's not some ice supposed to be sylveon's just happy and dancing and they've done the done espeon dirty flareons burning two berries sure it is why is it burning two berries you gotta cook them before you eat them dude and that horror horrible vaporeon which never should have been made that oh it gives me the shivers every single time uh i yeah i i'm just so disappointed don't you think that's beyond should have been like floating or just like smiling and happy like sylveon is ugh there's no it's no sylveon though so that's no maybe that's why it's just wrapped up in its own image because it didn't get the ribbons it's sad it wants to be better it's thinking trainer why didn't you make me sylvia i guess there you go all right it was a rhetorical question steve there's no true answer to this i figured if you put the vaporeon and the espn together does their water match up uh glacion also has water go into a circle or something they must probably yeah i yeah i would see it with the original little eevee uh one in the middle maybe yeah with the two eevees somebody buy all of them and then take a picture of it for me thank you i bet he's already been doing it no i haven't bought anything i'm not a huge eevee fan what's your pikachu fan yeah i like the pikachu me and pikachu go way back too late now because flareon sold out correct don't tell me that that's because they only made like 20 flareon because they didn't need to they would they do don't start barely sold out glaceon sold out people are like the these are the beanie babies of the 2020s [Laughter] if you haven't done so already uh we are nominations for the podcast awards are still open for our show for people's choice and for gaming and hobbies podcastawards.com it's in the show notes it closes on july 31st if you want to do a birthday present to me and a late birthday present to greg and will there you go there you go that's very easy and then on august 1st we'll see if we actually get nominated and then that'll put us in the finals for the final a round of voting so other birthday news is i'm doing a birthday stream on july 29th so if you want to come and say hi and hang out we will be playing unfortunately kale of darkness is that an umbrella game no it's a genius tale of darkness is so good no it's not well then why are you playing it on your birthday why are you bringing unhappiness into your life when you have a tr you you make choices that you could choose things that make you happy and yet you choose things that make you unhappy why why is this it's because i decided to be a twitch streamer it is that bringing you happiness some days do we need to step back and reflect upon where we are in the world reflection is bad ribbons on pokemon bring me happiness ah [Applause] [Music] you gotta start with either coliseum or gala darkness all right i have a bone to pick with you who did you make this voting bracket voting bracket there is a voting bracket to pick which shadow pokemon i will pick for my ribbon journey but by the time the podcast will go up we'll already be into like semifinals here dang well are you talking about the 16 pokemon yeah that was twitch chat picked those 16. never right but now twitch chats pair these up we randomized it what was the only fair way to do it so mad at you right now what what did i do you put rosalia against lapras oh rosalia wasn't that easy oh lapras g-max's lapras is goofy looking and you know people are gonna like be like ooh lapras i can ride it and get a pool floatie done be dirty i think roselia will win this one i think yeah i think rosalie will be fine against lapras the real the real question is lick a tongue for slow yeah that one i okay i stared okay i stared at that one and could not decide it's tough for a very long time the other one that killed me was sable i versus farfetch'd yeah that one's tough too i there are how is that tough say bly wins i mean table eye wins in my heart all the time but people who follow steve are we like farfetch though wait is it glarion far-fetched original far-fetched original garbage throw it in the trash i mean there is no contest between golduck and quillfish yeah cool fish all the way it is the year of the cool fish it's the year of the goal stuck all the way you threw a master ball to catch your gold duck yeah that's the olden days everything this is this is too upsetting i gotta get it i'm sorry times change people change with the times roll with it it's a rough bracket there's one pokemon i think i want to win really bad but i cannot reveal it oh interesting it's probably something that g max is because you actually care about that g-maxing is cool um but also this this is my hint this ribbon pokemon has to do a lot of battling look a lot of battling and there are some pokemon in that list that cannot hold their weight in battle at all pokemon of the week is my thing get out of my box you don't do hints and allegations but you also have to do a lot of contests and there are certain pokemon on this list that are going to be way better at that rosalia melodic milotic please it is not like a tongue i don't think phoebus or milotic were ever shadow pokemon i don't think so uh it'll be interesting uh i'm i'm i don't want to slog through get the gale of darkness would be a significantly better game if they removed two-thirds of the battles there are so many battles wait in a game about pokemon battling there are too many that's like saying in pokken tournament there are too many tournaments and not enough clothes combat in pokken tournament that's the problem [Music] darkness is a great game when when you remove the catching mechanic or you make it so gimmicky that you're only catching like once every hour in that game instead of you know however much you want in a main series game and you only focus on the battling you realize there's just too much battling you are the worst look if if if there was a better selection of pokemon if there's a better move selection maybe the battling wouldn't be that bad don't even get me started on low tad don't even get me started on the amount of low tad you have to slay to get through the end look every game has its low tad so that's just a pokemon standard how many low tide do you think are in gale darkness i'm gonna say at least 80 that you have to knock out i can honestly say i never played gale of darkness because i never had a game this is this is what i need i need a we're fighting low tad counter and i need to i need to we're fighting any pokemon that is not low tad counter and i guarantee you the low tad counter will be higher at the end of that game you are in control of this happening set it up i will set it up they should call it that on your twitch stream gail of low dad low dad of darkness all right i mean but mirror be though mirror be though let me say one good thing about gale darkness it has good music oh it has great music the amount of people who were like what is this song and the minute the minute the video started i'm like oh dang i love this song it's so good i think kayla darkness socks are so good i made i made it so jazzy i made a trailer very proud of it spent several hours on it i love to make little like announcement trailers for when we do big things on twitch and so because it was a ribbon quest i found all the stock footage of of like these ribbons falling from the sky and stuff and i was like okay cool um i'll use that because i'm not going to use pokemon footage or whatever and uh i was like well i'll pick a gale darkness song so you know when somebody's watching it once once they hear the song and they've played gale darkness they'll know right off the bat right and then you know if if the viewer is savvy enough in the first couple seconds they'll be like oh this is ribbon steve must be doing a ribbon quest because this is something we've talked about for for years is to do a ribbon quest you know a very big time consuming project and b and there were there i didn't think about this there was a third set of people that didn't know gail of darkness's music and didn't put like didn't understand the ribbons meant ribbon quest and they were like why is this trailer so sexual what it's a very jazzy song yeah it's a very song and it's like red and gold ribbon even irene was like ooh this is kind of uh such a good song adult and i was like this is just gala darkness it's like they like play that song when you're in like the rock town it's not even it's such a good song though it is i forgot about the special mew stuff in gala darkness use stuff yeah if you transfer a mu over from emerald there's a guy that teaches that will teach it over a hundred different moves and there are six moves that he can't learn that it can learn here that it cannot learn anywhere else in any other way or it was at the time i they probably are in now but well that'll be happening on uh on wednesday july 29th so if you want to come by say happy birthday just hang out i know we always get a couple people every week saying they listen to the podcast first time in twitch so we'll be doing that spending my birthday with you all the show always seems to come full circle here i guess this is like uh the i this is the this is the thing people click on they want to know you put pokemon card sells for this amount of money oh not again no not only do we have one of these articles this week we have two of these articles this week they're they're coming out of nowhere this is off kotaku dad who doesn't even like pokemon selling his card collection for thirty thousand dollars how much 30 k for what i will tell you a 34 year old father from england who does not nor has ever liked pokemon still managed to get his hands like josh dude is it him i don't know if they say the dude's name okay managed to get his hands on a complete set of original cards when he was a kid uh and so is now selling them to somebody who can appreciate a little more nigel brooks brooks that is like the most english of names yeah it is it's like england distilled into one name nigel brooks was given the set as a gift from his mother as his appreciation for hard work and what he did for looking after his little brother his bro did like pokemon and had gotten swindled out of some of the best cards by shady local kids this is your dad grade a journalism here um quote i found the kids and got my brother's cards back so as a present my mom bought me this rare collection direct from pokemon creators in the u.s for about 300 pounds brooke told the mirror i wasn't actually interested in pokemon i was disappointed at the time because they didn't include all the pokemon in the national decks oh wait no that's not what it says i was disappointed at the time would you stop because click bait i was disappointed at the time because the collection was one of my birthday presents so to me it was a waste of a present recognizing they may be someday worth something someday brooks hung on to them but until recently had uh after his daughter offered to buy them off for six pounds he decided to go and get them officially valued the complete 103 first gen first and first gen set which the mother paid for 380 usd is now estimated at between 31 000 to 44 000 usd at least my kids are growing up i want to be able to give them really a special childhood so with this money we can really set ourselves up for the future brooks says of his decided decision to sell although this article doesn't say if he did sell it also this article doesn't say i'm assuming the cards are probably first edition oh yeah they must be to be worth that much yeah i mean 30k is a good chunk of change well it'll get you half half tuition at an american universe yeah i was gonna say i don't know what colleges are costed in the uk but 30 000 is yeah about all right number two world's most expensive pokemon card sells for 250 this will get you a tuition yeah yeah it gave me a lot of things what the newest world record pokemon card sale took place earlier this month at zen plus an american customer did purchase the pokemon illustrator card for 250 000 we've talked about this card before it's sold before uh the last one sold in 2019 which we did cover for a hundred and ninety five thousand dollars i i doesn't say if this is the same card being sold i think we know that there's not a lot of these in existence anymore that's pretty much the entire article it just this is not the most expensive the most expensive card was this card at 195k last year this card is still now the most expensive card at 250k this year um and if you don't know what the illustrator card is it was a card that was given out in japan only for a contest it was like an illustration contest 39 people won the card in 1998 only 39 of these cards apparently exist how many of them are in the garbage or lost the time or had water spilled on them or in somebody's attic never to be seen again i don't know probably half of them probably maybe at least two of them uh we don't know how many cards are left in existence people love those expensive cards i don't know maybe next week we'll have another one of this card sold for 300 000 i would find that hard to believe two sword and shield articles here first one being bothoffpokemon.com there is a new tournament we should have covered this last week by the time this podcast goes up registration will be closed but from wednesday which ball guy shirt do i get as a reward i'm out i'm so out only 50 battle points registration july 15th to july 23rd it is single battles oh that's when you gotta swap the pokemons in and out all the time yeah you gotta use the toxic you gotta you know the dynamics the tournament will take place july 23rd to july 26th you know just happen to have the have a pokemon masters event this week have new cafe characters do a pokemon go fest have a tournament this weekend too i don't know they really like to throw it all in the same week well it's like you're not even allowed to have a life anymore you've just got to be pokemon 24 7. wait till sleep comes up where is it give me give me my sleep i need to sleep i what happened to that program seriously sleep and detective yeah my my guess on sleep is because uh the factories had to shut down in china for so long that they couldn't make the devices yet what devices you know that much there was a little thing you you put on your bed yeah it was called the pokemon go plus plus remember it had a beautiful name oh that's right the place i had i had to wipe that out of my memory because it was so bad so you can't launch a mobile app if you don't have the dumb little plastic thing to put on your pillow the dongle no dongle no dice that would be that is my guess is they couldn't the the dongle's not done being made we gotta get an insider out in china to check on dongle chinese listeners find the dongle let us know where the dongle is single battles this weekend by the time this podcast goes up tournament will be over but that happened 50 battle points don't worry you didn't miss out on a shirt we will definitely let you know when another bald guy shirt is coming oh for sure luxury ball guy is the one i am waiting for oh i'll be in that tournament uh maybe you haven't bought the dlc yet maybe you're unsure what it includes pokemon.com here kind of really lists everything that the dlc has so we'll go through it real quick just a friendly reminder uh first one is you can get rare items with the cram-o-matic it says hopefully after it too the scam-o-matic gamma-matic yeah well you'll spend most of your time on the isle of armor working with the dojo master mustard and his wife it's their son who may keep you coming back thanks to the bizarre item combining contraption you'll have to give them just some watts to get it started but as you might expect this device that isn't even functional when you arrive is a bit unreliable with a bit of luck the cram-o-matic can churn out some rare items otherwise you can only get unlimited qualities quantities or quality quality of the item is pretty bad too to use the chromomatic insert four items cross your fingers as a strange device combines them hopefully you get an item that is rare than what you put in this process can create such cool items as rare candies to make ability capsules or bottle caps to make gold bottle caps but while you may but what may be the most interesting is the ability to make rare poke balls like heavy balls love balls or even safari and sport balls to make these items is that on your infographic it is it is okay infographic thank you to make the uh sport ball and safari bar a one in a thousand chance so rude well it's less easier to find than a shiny pokemon technically how do i get my ball charm uh no ball charm yet to make these items you'll have to find the appropriate colored apricorns on the island combining them making pokeballs this way is not quite as reliable as the process kurt used in the johto region's azealia town and i think actually when you make your first apricorn ball like let's say you pop out a love ball um what's his name what's that kid's name charlie no it was like milo or something no it wasn't milo no it had nothing to do with mustard and you guys looked it up for me and i was just so disappointed it's like when is it wendell though it's something mayo uh he'll he'll pretty much tell you that like uh kurt visited one time and the thing doesn't make him as good as kurt or something like that he gives you some dialogue about kurt uh teach your new pokemon hide hi yeah there you go hide as the sun hide the honey mustard teach your pokemon new incredible moves after you get to a certain point into the adventure you'll find one of mustard students is willing to teach your pokemon some never-before-seen moves as long as you're willing to cough up ten sorry five pieces of armorite ore per move might seem like a high price it's not if you haven't spent a lot of time moves are worth it unlike move tutors of past pokemon adventures this fellow teaches moves that no pokemon have ever been able to learn before each of these moves are very impactful especially when used in battles against your friends or online players the most one of them close combat no never before seen moves okay most of these moves fall under two categories multi-hit attacks like dual wing beat or triple and triple axel that seem to fit the martial arts theme of the dojo and the trickier attacks like grassy glide expanding force and burning jealousy that have their full effect in battle when certain conditions are happening those three moves are incredibly popular uh if only avery were able to create some psychic terrain for you if you were looking for some more armor right ore if you do well in ranked battle and you want to invest teaching your pokemon some of these news attacks you gotta spend armor right or to make arma rador they're referring to here is if you make it to master rank in either double or singles or both you will get 30 armorite ore for the end of the season but you get about one to two armor right or per max raid battle so it's they're not hard to get yeah but then i got to do max raid battles you could have got that shiny whalered coulda shoulda went up yeah when everybody has a shiny waylord it's not special no one has that they're just they're just giving it away uh what about collecting non-native forms of pokemon from galler uh some pokemon native to geller have different forms that can be found in other regions if you don't have a huge backlog of pokemon and pokemon home you might be wondering how to get some of these on your teams worry not there are two different ways to add these pokemon to your collection uh number one as you journey across the island of armor you will meet a trainer looking to trade glaring regionals forms gallerian regional forms of meowth ponyta mr mime and others in exchange for forms not found in galler and it isn't just the pokemon with gallerian forms that you can trade this way you also will be able to trade exeggutor or marowak for the alolan region variants that's really good for people who haven't played sun and moon if you're looking for even more regional variants you will meet a man who is crazy about alolan diglett as you start your adventure you can help him seek out 151 missing alolan diglett and he will help you fill out your collection with many rare pokemon including alolan vulpix slowpoke found outside the isle of armor and other regional variants plus these pokemon will have their hidden abilities and there will be uh and better than normal individual strengths too if you're really determined to track down a ton of diglett he will also give you a first partner pokemon from the alola region for finding a hundred find 150 and you will get your very own alolan diglett that it's excellent in battle just don't get obsessed with it like that guy is there's no such thing as a diglett that's excellent in battle [Applause] will did you finish your diglett not yet now greg still all right i literally just got my cub food at level 70 this week so we we got to hit one of them towers which one are you going to do the dark one of course i'm drawn to darkness true i need to do my sword one so i can get my other one i have not completed the i'm missing like there's like one there's one area that has like 16 when you start and i'm like missing three and i've like i had to sit down and get a guide because i don't know where they are and i can't be bothered like with the if i was getting a shirt i'd be all for it knowing what i'm actually getting i'm like i can wait yeah i already got one of them i got a lot of them i can go play the game where i can get a lot more for free yeah i have to get 151 on my own and transfer them over familiar are you guys with digging ma and digging paw i don't like digging ma i like digging paw i don't know digging paws kind of like greedy if you explore to the wild area during your initial journey you probably met the digging duo a pair of brothers who would dig up items for watts uh on the island you can on the isle of armor you can encounter some new digging experts or perhaps some older ones digging paw and digging ma are on the job but they want currency more valuable than watts they want armor right ore you'll have an easier time finding digging paw who is outside the training low lance in exchange from armory door they'll dig you up some watts if you find yourself with a surplus of armor right ore uh he can help you turn it into watts to spend on other activities digging ma is a bit trickier to find as you'll have to hunt her down and she's in new locations each time you want her to dig she'll offer you a single piece of armory door or you can tell her to hold on to it to start digging choose the ladder and she'll dig for more armorite ore until you tell her to stop be careful her shovel can break at any time and you'll lose all the armorite or she found get lucky and you could end up with buckets of armored ore or you could get nothing i don't think i've gotten more than four armored ore from her i stopped she's she she has broken her shovel every single time yeah it's like no it's not worth it i lose everything i don't even keep the ones you found like what your shovel broke and then you re-buried all the order you found yeah exactly what what kind of terrible digger are you it's like well my shovel broke so i'm just going to fill in this hole let's not see my error i'm going to cover my sins so you don't get anything she's terrible it is exciting to find her she doesn't move around no it's not it's like no steer away from that scam that's worse than the machine and that's always there you know you don't like the digging ma digging paw prove that your older pokemon are battle ready i mean i like digging pot did you not even even cover digging pod did you did i miss it yeah yeah you did yeah it just says right for watts but like the you get all the watts yeah the shovel breaks but honey honey milks you dry yeah but then you get to go on a date with her so is that that's a married woman oh she don't care yeah she don't care she knows what she's about i don't know what world you people live in tell me about my old pokemon and how i'm going to revitalize them if you've transferred pokemon from a game other than sword and shield through pokemon home you may have noticed they may not be eligible for ranked battles in victory stadium or for most official competitions while in the past you would have to catch new pokemon for these battles a helpful new character in the back of the battle tower in winden can give you uh can give your imported pokemon a battle ready symbol allowing them to be used in battle that was previously restricted to pokemon caught or hatched in galler pokemon given the battle ready symbol will forget all their current moves and learn a new set it is possible some forgotten moves cannot be relearned so be careful we've talked about this dude before yeah he's good can we can we talk about the the the rumor of uh the isle of armor or sorry the crown tundra what's the rumor no yeah rumor rumored that will be in the game that the data miners found so we don't know if it's true or not it's not true but there the rumor is that there will be a hidden ability capsule in the crown tundra oh so even better than the mobility capsule yeah that is that is the rumor it's like i mean i'm there for a i mean when you're breeding for hidden ability or you found one with a mark but you know you can change it that's worth it that's way worth it yeah i mean it's one of probably the last two things that people have complained about which is hidden ability and um zero iv bottle caps are probably the only two competitive complaints as well and one specific this one specific twitch streamer goes on about the all the time a de-evolution spray and like oh yeah spray would be good too yeah what if you accidentally evolved uh you know your your dust skull all the way up to a dust clops then you realize that dust collapse is actually not or dust noir sorry and then you were like oh dust klopp's is actually better than dusk noir then you get good scrub and you gotta start all over again what if you accidentally caught a shiny pidgey and then you weren't paying attention then you evolved the pidgey into a pidgeotto but you wanted to be a pidgey forever catch another one i wonder okay so if they do do a hidden ability capsule i wonder what it would be like a hundred battle points 50 battle points like an ability capsule is already 50. well maybe it's not battle points at all maybe you have to win it some other way i mean i would imagine that it would say it's 50. like there's nothing particularly special about i mean if you're getting it as a capsule why not just keep it at the same price they've always made hidden ability pokemon like slightly like they always not like harder but they always added like one more hoop to jump through for hidden ability stuff yeah i feel like though if you're already just admitting hey we're gonna we're gonna just capsule this away that like if you wanna hit like if you wanted a hidden belly starter you have to you know sign up for pokemon bank sign up for pokemon home we're giving out a hidden ability starters and you gotta you know trade trade breed them and trade them and that's if you miss the event that's how you got to do it and it's like if you haven't been like two weeks you go to reddit and it's like i have 5 000 hidden ability ones who wants one and you don't even care about their ivs because you're only looking for the hidden ability like within two weeks that gate is obliterated and forgotten what if you wanted uh you know hidden ability mewtwo you gotta buy pokemon red and blue on the virtual console and then play it and then catch it and then transfer it up hit what is hidden ability mewtwo it's just it just changes from pressure to generation or something no it's they're both bad it's pressure and unnerving abilities they're both bad oh but mega is insomnia oh that's not awful i mean it's not great it's better than pressure oh mega mewtwo x is steadfast what is steadfast increases the user's speed when flinched oh that's not that good none of these are good nobody wants to use the capsule on youtube your your example is garbage next i i just can't okay so i can't see them making the hidden ability like well maybe they can i don't know like a gimmick because the whole point of it is to lower the barrier for competitive and they already know their competitive people don't actually play the video game you're not wrong you're not wrong the amount of battles that i've had with people through ranked and it's just i i feel like the standard trainer card with the basic outfit because they haven't progressed past yeah whatever the first town is i feel like they could if they don't keep it the same which i think they should do then they're pro they're probably gonna double it which is just dumb because the people who really want that who are big competitor competitors that 100 is a not a barrier he is just yeah you're right like anyone who is battling non-stop even if it was 200 battle points like that's pretty easy for them to come by i mean you're getting like two battle points per battle you're getting 600 battle points after a season and there aren't that many good hidden ability like there are a handful that hidden ability is better but i don't think it's across the board for competitive that people will pick the hidden ability over one of their standard abilities depends on the team makeup that you're trying to make that's that's all it comes down to but at this point what makes a hidden ability to hit an ability dream world get to go to the dream world to get it yeah or you have to do raids it just seems weird that they've kind of protected this for so long and now they're just like well here's an item hey we don't know we don't know maybe you only get one per game yeah that's true i mean maybe you can't buy it but i think i still think that would be weird they've protected a lot of things for so long and have lowered the barrier shiny charms marked charm they have continually lowered superior for things that they protected move tutors breeding egg moves on to existing pokemon like they are blowing out all of the things that are just pointless barriers there is no reason for them to be there it they have seemed to have a track record where they always seem to reward players who buy their second version right so like in sun and moon there were no there were no move tutors and i think they made it like way easier to get like bottle caps or something and so they're rewarding they are rewarding people who are buying the dlc with these quality of life features which i guess is probably the the best thing you can offer uh because they have removed stuff before like again in ultrasound ultramoon they're like here's rotom boost you getting hatch eggs faster you can get more money you can get more experience by activating these boosts and now we remove all those for the next game yeah because it's a different region and the rotoms behave differently there's a row top i almost said a bad word rotom grass floating around on an island out there for no reason no stuck logical it is stuck it's stuck it can't mow across there and every time i catch it it comes back and i'm like it's like unlike oh did you know we somebody in our slack sent me a snap of warlord coming back oh alex yeah yeah alex alex got the weight lord back alex at the wheeler and i asked how did you get this i asked him the same question and he said i don't know i don't know the answer to everyone heartbreaking no one knows how to get it back mine is not back yet i've played every day since the dlc uh that's the problem you need to take a day off i i i have defeated honey i have crammed oh scammed i have done countless raids i have i have done everything and wailord is not back i don't know what it is all reggie's to the island maybe i need a party of six coil fish and i just spit in a circle okay some other things you can do maybe you're still not convinced on this dlc you give pokemon the giganta max factor this is another thing we were talking about remember before the dlc remember before sword shield came out we were like i was like i remember this specifically because i was like why would you if they're if they're restricting gigantomax pokemon to raids why would you catch a rookie d and evolve it into corvonite when you know it can't gigantomax and that's what they actually did they left like you could only get gigantic max corbinite and raids your rookie could not do that but in the dlc you'll get a chance to sample max soup during your adventure you can ladle out some to add the gigantic max form to any pokemon able to giganta max if you're attached to a particular pokemon perhaps your first partner pokemon an old favor transferred from home or a shiny pokemon you can use the max soup to get them uh uh to get them on an even playing field with the rarest pokemon in galler the only pokemon you have to assist further for this is the picky urshifu to recreate more max soup venture out into the courageous cavern brawler brawler's cave forest the focus or warm-up tunnel to find max mushrooms if you can't find max mushrooms in these locations try completing some max raid battles before looking again gotta lower that air lower that barrier of entry yep yep get it down so that everybody wants to play reset your pokemon based at totals we have not talked about this lady uh as your pokemon defeat other pokemon and consume vitamins it'll start to excel in certain stats which are represented by its base points if you would like it if you'd like your pokemon to have different stats it normally requires feeding them an extravagant amount of special berries to wipe slate extravagant yeah yes to wipe their slate clean in the isle of armor on a small island in workout sea you'll find a girl named lady clear who will be able to erase your pokemon's base points more easily for 10 armorite ore she'll clear them all instantly removing the headache and letting you get right back to training finally your marked charm on isle of armor wouldn't be a new pokemon adventure without a new pokedex to complete the armor is home to 200 pokemon many of which are not found in the mainland of gallard track down all the pokemon and return to the island of armor station talk to the scientists there when you do shall reward you with a new item the mark charm which will increase the odds of the wild pokemon having a certain mark if you find a pokemon with a mark if it has one it will appear in the ribbon tab a pokemon with a mark also has a special message when sent into battle whether you're looking to train pokemon or taking in the news sites we hope you enjoy your time in the isle of armor keep an eye out for other neat features on the isle of armor like a helpful woman who can change the color of your rotom bike don't get tripped up by this island's speedy slowpoke or tricky trainers look forward to the second part of the expansion in fall of 2020 there you go they didn't talk about mustard's battle league or whatever it's called sparring that's a secret still secrets secrets secret secret i don't know i think the uh i think the dlc was worth it i mean i keep playing it every day so i've got my dollars worth i play it every monday for raid night and then a couple of times during the week i forget that i i keep thinking oh did i pick up leon's clothing items and i always check the mystery gift i'm like oh yeah i did i need to finally remember that i have them because i keep thinking that there should be more to the outfit than yeah there's only two it's like the there's only two leggings and the leggings in the hat and for a while i was having a hairstyle that could not wear hats and then you get a shirt you get a shirt normally when you beat them yeah yeah all right that is all the news greg question of the week question of the week i'm not sure but was that beyonce sure okay kevin says if you can have kevin from our slack community you could have one item from the pokemon from the pokey world irl what would you pick one item one item i guess like the things that you can give to your pokemon to hold for like a key item can i do like a road town bike i mean sure why not yeah that goes in your bag too that goes in your bag that's where my mind went first was rotom bike i mean it fits in my backpack and it's a bike and it's a rotom i don't think will can put his bike in his backpack you are correct okay i have my bikes are too large i have a fundamental question and we can put this up for debate if i'm holding an amulet coin and its payday is my paycheck doubled oh i would have said yes oh yeah all right dang that's a good choice that's a really good choice you'd have enough money to buy my bike off me yeah i'm going with amulet coin i imagine that like i go and buy something when i get the change change is doubled making money off of every sale yeah it's pretty good i don't know i kind of want to say a quick claw ooh sometimes i go faster sixteen percent of the time isn't it eighteen point seven five it might be or is it sixteen uh it's either eighteen or sixteen i can't remember it's not good still when it hits it feels good when it hits feels good [Laughter] look like you got to take your bonuses where you can get them in this world absolutely rotom bike amulet coin quick claw the three best items in the pokemon world i mean i might do a sharp beak maybe you doing with a shark beak i feel like you could buy those at target by many of them if target is still on side then yeah i actually buy a ton of like protectors and reaper cloths and all that what am i gonna do with a protector that sales dude is the worst it's just the worse exactly like i every day i'm coming and buying from you an ounce of gratitude and i have bought doubles triples quadruples of your terrible items in the hopes that one day you'll say something nice or be happy that i'm giving you my hard-earned cash i go next door to your friend who's more than happy to buy my junk for double triple price that guy's a good sales person you're a jerk eight months since this game's been out i think i've gotten two chipped pots oh i just there yeah exactly it has to be a one in 100 chance so bad that's how they keep you coming back so you can get them chip pots i do like the dailies look i like i'm a sucker for dailies in a game i do my lotto when i first booted up i hit up the stow inside brothers check my trees check my dens so here's a question what can i get for weather stones i'm sure the crime will take him i don't know what he gives you though that's what i'm saying to find out what if i stick some weather stones in the scam-o-matic what pops out i know if you have a bunch of dynamics candy and you don't know what to do with it you can just stuff that into the cram i give you a dragon fang i think is it cram-o-matic cram-o-matic yeah the weatherstones have to give you something right yeah they do everything gives you something yeah it'll give you a sachet for evolving freaking flownies [Laughter] what's our pokemon of the week well last week's pokemon of the week i read a paragraph that had a lot of words in it where if you were paying attention i gave them a particular emphasis um also greg ruined the pokemon of the week by saying it in a sentence with a particular emphasis at the beginning of the program i did not ruin it the words were things like uh terrible and frightful and horrible and grim etc etc etc so what who was the pokemon i also mentioned to the date july 19th 2020 which honestly who's the pokemon of the week it's lily pup little pup he said it was frightful yes hope it's cute [Applause] years we've done this show are you saying we've never done gastliest pokemon of the week i don't know no no i got repeats already because i did chat like seven years ago dude i thought you did chat like last week yeah last week i did i'm getting on repeats you know some some pokemon aren't made for pokemon of the week you've got that so right like uh what comes after trico sceptile no profile i do that's true no one wants a girl vial everybody watch it's a punk a great punk sure it is no pokemon have the same type combination as gastly and its evolved forms despite all of them being poisoned pokemon gasly and its evolutionary family were not not able to learn poison type moves by leveling up prior to let's go pikachu let's go eevee gastly has is tied with the lowest hp stat of all poison type pokemon with venipede the lowest defense stat of all poison type pokemon with weedle and the lowest defense stat of all ghost type pokemon with the dreepy gastly is a ball yep the big ball of gas ghastly is one of my favorite pokemon it's very cute although i mean that whole line i love them all really the shiny is so bad it was so hard on ghastly day to be like is this actually shiny i'm in the sunlight and i can't tell if the purple is slightly brighter they should have made it that whole shiny line white true i agree with red eyes we could have a whole podcast complaining about shiny colors we should do that remember when we were gonna do special podcasts for like quarterly et cetera et cetera put that on the schedule we're doing the shiny complaint cast oh boy we're going to do our top 10 worst chinese these are all going to be lime green i don't know i think uh yeah that's got a pretty terrible shiny stretch your mouth wow wow came for his baby you see you ready for this week's pokemon yeah yeah well the truth has been revealed it was a mistake to animate some pokemon in the overworld i recently had a pokemon as the first pokemon in my party holding a lucky egg so that it could soak up as much experience as possible and evolve into its final evolution it first evolves at level 30 and then does not reach its final evolution until it hits level 55. that is a long time and a lot of experience required for someone who doesn't use experience candies the problem is this middle evolution does not have any arms or legs so in the overworld it just kind of hops around even worse its bottom comes to a kind of point so it looks like a top balanced on its point that could tip over at any moment since its only animation is its eyes it just sort of looks angry and sad as it follows you hop hop hopping around the isle of armor even though this pokemon and its predecessor are named for forms of insect maturation it never has a bug type even so you can imagine what it would be like to have a metapod or cocuna hopping around to follow you on your journeys and you are on the right track i must admit i also made the error of not paying attention to this pokemon's typing as i had it in my party it definitely learns dark type moves prior to evolving into its final form including crunch even though it doesn't have a mouth but it does not receive a stab bonus for those hand in hand with that it loses stab on earthquake when it reaches its final evolution in the future i would argue that the animators should include a little wagon to pull pokemon similar to these around in until they have legs of their own there you go that's it that's it that's your pokemon of the week next week will be our 10 year anniversary show can't believe uh can't believe it's been 10 years
