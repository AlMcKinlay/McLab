today (1:59 - 2:02)
no no clue how uh go fest (2:03 - 2:09)
went or happened i'm sure it'd be fine (2:06 - 2:11)
this is what their fourth one they've (2:09 - 2:12)
done (2:11 - 2:14)
millions of communities they've done the (2:12 - 2:16)
genesect thing they did the other things (2:14 - 2:17)
i'm sure it'll be fine (2:16 - 2:19)
i'm sure and you know what's nice is (2:17 - 2:21)
they don't have to worry about any kind (2:19 - 2:22)
of mobile signal (2:21 - 2:25)
access not their problem this year the (2:22 - 2:26)
only people that have to worry are (2:25 - 2:27)
people from new zealand because they go (2:26 - 2:28)
first (2:27 - 2:30)
that's really what it comes down to it (2:28 - 2:32)
is 10 hours both days (2:30 - 2:35)
uh from 10 a.m to 8 p.m both days (2:32 - 2:36)
saturday sunday (2:35 - 2:38)
i was actually saying this on my twitch (2:36 - 2:40)
stream i don't know who's dedicating all (2:38 - 2:41)
20 (2:40 - 2:44)
hours of a 48-hour period i'm sure i'm (2:41 - 2:45)
sure (2:44 - 2:48)
plenty of people are uh definitely we (2:45 - 2:49)
hope it doesn't take up too much of your (2:48 - 2:50)
time (2:49 - 2:51)
as somebody who's actually gone to go (2:50 - 2:54)
fest at a certain point (2:51 - 2:56)
your body wants to give up faster than (2:54 - 2:58)
you do (2:56 - 3:00)
all that walking especially if you're (2:58 - 3:02)
playing outside in the sun (3:00 - 3:03)
but i suppose there are a bunch of (3:02 - 3:05)
people who might be playing at home (3:03 - 3:07)
or might be playing in their car where (3:05 - 3:09)
it's air conditioned so (3:07 - 3:11)
i will say i'm very sad that we won't be (3:09 - 3:13)
seeing like all of the listeners and (3:11 - 3:14)
everybody that we usually get to (3:13 - 3:16)
see get together at go fest that's (3:14 - 3:18)
that's a big disappointment for me (3:16 - 3:20)
you know those are always next year (3:18 - 3:24)
unless things get old (3:20 - 3:24)
wow let's not let's not plan that far (3:24 - 3:27)
out and get the heartbreak (3:26 - 3:29)
it's already pretty much that we aren't (3:27 - 3:31)
going to worlds (3:29 - 3:33)
speaking of heartbreak we got a (3:31 - 3:35)
heartbreaking news article to start off (3:33 - 3:36)
with (3:35 - 3:40)
oh great what is depression central (3:36 - 3:41)
this is why we don't do this on (3:40 - 3:43)
wednesdays yeah we're not (3:41 - 3:44)

right here we go pokemon (3:44 - 3:50)
rumble rush service (3:47 - 3:53)
ending what july 21st (3:50 - 3:56)
to yep i'll tell you why wait that means (3:53 - 3:57)
it's already ended (3:56 - 3:59)
it ended yesterday yeah it's because (3:57 - 4:00)
it's a horizontal game (3:59 - 4:02)
pokemon go and pokemon masters have some (4:00 - 4:03)
words with you (4:02 - 4:05)
no they were vertical no rush was (4:03 - 4:07)

you for enjoying (4:31 - 4:35)
pokemon rumble rush that was off (4:33 - 4:37)
pokemon.com (4:35 - 4:40)
that is so um what is the word like (4:37 - 4:43)
disingenuous because nobody enjoyed that (4:40 - 4:45)
game (4:43 - 4:48)
there is probably a person a person (4:45 - 4:50)
one person with the yes rumble rush (4:48 - 4:52)
fanatic (4:50 - 4:54)
i think i installed the game i think i (4:52 - 4:56)
mean you install a lot of things buddy (4:54 - 4:58)
that's true the question is did i open (4:56 - 5:00)
it i don't think i did (4:58 - 5:04)
i think you did on at one point i'm (5:00 - 5:07)
pretty sure you did i just i don't think (5:04 - 5:08)
ambrella (5:07 - 5:12)
makes good games i can't get into that (5:08 - 5:13)
debate again (5:12 - 5:15)
but there's no debate i mean they just (5:13 - 5:16)
don't there's not a game (5:15 - 5:18)
under there's not a game under their (5:16 - 5:20)
umbrella that they've they've made that (5:18 - 5:21)
was good (5:20 - 5:22)
well but now that they've been bought (5:21 - 5:24)
out by 10 cent i'm sure (5:22 - 5:26)
they'll start improving their production (5:24 - 5:27)
yeah (5:26 - 5:28)
that is not true they have not been (5:27 - 5:31)
bought by 10 cent yet (5:28 - 5:32)
yet i know it's like everybody's going (5:31 - 5:34)
to get bought by 10 at some point in (5:32 - 5:35)
time (5:34 - 5:36)
that's i mean that's it that's it for (5:35 - 5:38)
rumble rush uh i know there was like a (5:36 - 5:40)
shaymin event last week they did to like (5:38 - 5:43)
save farewell i guess i'm not in a (5:40 - 5:44)
position where (5:43 - 5:46)
i'm playing a game that is ending so i (5:44 - 5:47)
don't know what that feels like (5:46 - 5:49)
rips your heart right out of your chest (5:47 - 5:50)
buddy yeah (5:49 - 5:54)
like by the time destiny ended destiny 2 (5:50 - 5:54)
was (5:54 - 5:56)
no no no no i'm sorry destiny is a (5:54 - 5:58)
10-year game that's what my friend told (5:56 - 6:00)
me when he convinced me to buy the ps4 (5:58 - 6:04)
specifically to pay a 10-year game (6:00 - 6:07)
we played three of those 10 years (6:04 - 6:09)
what year are we in that we would have (6:07 - 6:11)
been i don't know (6:09 - 6:13)
we are like in year seven they could (6:11 - 6:15)
have been in the home stretch at this (6:13 - 6:17)
point in time if they hadn't given up (6:15 - 6:20)
speaking of mobile games i wasn't giving (6:17 - 6:24)
up pokemon masters (6:20 - 6:24)
full of disclosure i am partnered with (6:24 - 6:27)
dna (6:26 - 6:30)
i do want to go on the record that i am (6:27 - 6:30)
unhappy (6:30 - 6:33)
did they nerf super course egg drops and (6:30 - 6:34)
i just i'm (6:33 - 6:37)
unaware yeah i think they did are they (6:34 - 6:38)
only doing the (6:37 - 6:42)
bug eggs and nothing else (6:38 - 6:45)
i mean it could be that it's locked into (6:42 - 6:47)
the bug egg course because they want you (6:45 - 6:47)
to (6:47 - 6:48)
do the bug egg course because i have (6:47 - 6:51)
gotten an egg every time i've done (6:48 - 6:54)
a repeat bug course so it's possible (6:51 - 6:56)
that they just want (6:54 - 6:58)
that i don't know like they if they did (6:56 - 7:00)
that shouldn't they tell us (6:58 - 7:03)
yeah i think yes i still like doing my (7:00 - 7:05)
super courses mostly for the eggs i mean (7:03 - 7:07)
the rewards are fine but i do like the (7:05 - 7:08)
egg mechanic (7:07 - 7:11)
anyways this gets to the egg stuff that (7:08 - 7:12)
is happening in masters is up (7:11 - 7:13)
pokemon.com as well (7:12 - 7:15)
hatch scyther pincer and more during the (7:13 - 7:18)
pokemon masters bug type egg event (7:15 - 7:20)
i do think this event is good pokemon (7:18 - 7:22)
masters players may (7:20 - 7:24)
start feeling a bit bugged while (7:22 - 7:25)
hatching eggs (7:24 - 7:27)
that's because a special bug uh type egg (7:25 - 7:29)
event is on the way from now until (7:27 - 7:29)
august 2nd (7:29 - 7:32)
you can win an event you can win a an (7:29 - 7:34)
event battle to receive an egg (7:32 - 7:36)
from professor bellas by placing this (7:34 - 7:38)
egg inside the incubator (7:36 - 7:39)
you can hatch it into a bug type pokemon (7:38 - 7:42)
such as scyther pincer or others (7:39 - 7:44)
others as far as i know is weedle and (7:42 - 7:45)
venonat (7:44 - 7:48)
this event uh battle can be repeated and (7:45 - 7:49)
replayed (7:48 - 7:52)
for a reduced chance of obtaining bug (7:49 - 7:53)
type eggs (7:52 - 7:55)
plus there's even more buggy who wrote (7:53 - 7:57)
this there's more buggy fun (7:55 - 8:01)
with the return of your boy (7:57 - 8:03)
guzma it does say that it does say your (8:01 - 8:04)
boy guzma (8:03 - 8:07)
the five star bug type sink pair guzma (8:04 - 8:08)
and golisa pod is back (8:07 - 8:12)
again for the scout spot spotlight scout (8:08 - 8:13)
so you have another chance to scout the (8:12 - 8:15)
team skull boss on your team (8:13 - 8:18)
pokemon masters is free what they don't (8:15 - 8:19)
say in this press release is you do get (8:18 - 8:21)
a free (8:19 - 8:23)
well as of this recording an 11 day free (8:21 - 8:25)
incubator which is great (8:23 - 8:27)
unlimited use for the 11 days two (8:25 - 8:28)
incubators (8:27 - 8:31)
instead of the one you have which is (8:28 - 8:32)
nice (8:31 - 8:35)
i i can't i can't pull for guzma with (8:32 - 8:37)
with the like fancy steven stone around (8:35 - 8:37)
the corner (8:37 - 8:40)
i i gotta i gotta say yeah (8:37 - 8:43)
saving my polls to i got i got i got my (8:40 - 8:45)
boy guzma (8:43 - 8:49)
and now i'm waiting for my boy steven (8:45 - 8:51)
stevenstone summer version if you could (8:49 - 8:52)
get good (8:51 - 8:54)
you wouldn't have to worry about your (8:52 - 8:56)
pulse there you go you're not wrong (8:54 - 9:00)
you do get a higher chance of increasing (8:56 - 9:01)
the egg drops (9:00 - 9:04)
if you use bug type trainers (9:01 - 9:07)
so i think guzma is undoubtedly the best (9:04 - 9:08)
bug type (9:07 - 9:12)
sink pair yeah but i will suggest to you (9:08 - 9:12)
not to (9:12 - 9:17)
uh maybe stay away from the (9:12 - 9:21)
the sink pair with the sur skid she (9:17 - 9:24)
um don't maybe not maybe hey (9:21 - 9:28)
hold up whoo okay (9:24 - 9:31)
her ability to heal though on those (9:28 - 9:34)
when you do just fantastic that heel (9:31 - 9:37)
lets like basically she becomes a tank (9:34 - 9:40)
and so you can do whatever you want with (9:37 - 9:43)
uh goosebumps because they'll attack (9:40 - 9:44)
then you just have to hit one attack and (9:43 - 9:46)
she'll hit and she'll heal (9:44 - 9:49)
because i ever has a masculine so yes (9:46 - 9:51)
mascarine yeah i leveled i leveled her (9:49 - 9:52)
up all the way to like (9:51 - 9:55)
100 for this event oh (9:52 - 9:57)
geez do you want to talk about which (9:55 - 9:58)
which pairs (9:57 - 10:00)
of the bug pairs are actually good (9:58 - 10:01)
because no (10:00 - 10:05)
it's well i didn't want a level one (10:01 - 10:08)
i didn't want to like pick a scyther or (10:05 - 10:09)
a pincer (10:08 - 10:11)
from the eggs because noland has a (10:09 - 10:13)
pincer he's a four-star sink pair (10:11 - 10:16)
yeah so nolan is good and guzman is good (10:13 - 10:16)
yeah (10:16 - 10:18)
so i leveled up nolan so i would suggest (10:16 - 10:20)
if you're picking just one bug type (10:18 - 10:22)
personal level up and you have (10:20 - 10:25)
what's her name vila viola (10:22 - 10:29)
viola yeah maybe put your energy into (10:25 - 10:30)
noland if you have nolan because (10:29 - 10:32)
megapincer is pretty good but the reason (10:30 - 10:33)
i didn't want to like (10:32 - 10:36)
assign my own character a pincer or (10:33 - 10:37)
scyther is because i was like well what (10:36 - 10:38)
if i get a shiny one (10:37 - 10:40)
that i want to assign that and then i (10:38 - 10:42)
want to level that up but (10:40 - 10:44)
i've had no such luck yet okay so here's (10:42 - 10:45)
the thing there are no (10:44 - 10:49)
good support type bugs (10:45 - 10:52)
there just aren't there aren't any in (10:49 - 10:52)
that (10:52 - 10:56)
in that area both noland pincer and (10:52 - 10:59)
golisapod are physical strikers (10:56 - 11:01)
which is unfortunate that they're both (10:59 - 11:03)
physical strikers but they're both (11:01 - 11:07)
they're both equal for tech literally (11:03 - 11:08)
the only tech one (11:07 - 11:11)
is viola and masquerade and they are (11:08 - 11:12)
also tier two (11:11 - 11:15)
so you're i mean your choices are so (11:12 - 11:17)
incredibly limited but (11:15 - 11:20)
at least masquerading gives you a tech a (11:17 - 11:21)
different type that's not a physical (11:20 - 11:22)
striker (11:21 - 11:25)
not that that's that important like this (11:22 - 11:26)
this event is what is (11:25 - 11:30)
not recovery or support (11:26 - 11:31)
i don't i haven't i've never loved a (11:30 - 11:33)
little bug so i don't know what he (11:31 - 11:36)
does not very much not very much i think (11:33 - 11:38)
bugsy is also strike (11:36 - 11:40)
let me look for bugsy hold on yeah bugsy (11:38 - 11:42)
is physical strike (11:40 - 11:45)
also and tier four of the tears is (11:42 - 11:48)
bad the weedles i have seem to be (11:45 - 11:50)
support that i got from eggs (11:48 - 11:52)
maybe that's what they want you to do (11:50 - 11:54)
the eggs maybe now i mean (11:52 - 11:55)
this isn't this is talking about (11:54 - 11:57)
existing pairs i don't know i haven't (11:55 - 11:57)
looked up (11:57 - 12:00)
but for existing pairs those are the (11:57 - 12:02)
ones yeah there are there is beedrill (12:00 - 12:04)
support i guess that would fill (12:02 - 12:07)
that role i don't know how good that is (12:04 - 12:10)
since it's new it's brand new (12:07 - 12:12)
i don't know that there's been a ton is (12:10 - 12:14)
there yeah there's also a tech bedroll (12:12 - 12:15)
so (12:14 - 12:16)
yeah cause the well i think the eggs (12:15 - 12:18)
unless unless it's a shiny because the (12:16 - 12:19)
chinese are (12:18 - 12:22)
are set yeah i just feel like looking (12:19 - 12:26)
at the moves tech i mean support scyther (12:22 - 12:30)
is just going to be better than weedle (12:26 - 12:32)
isn't that how it always is though (12:30 - 12:33)
they're better than wheels (12:32 - 12:35)
like we're not i mean just like because (12:33 - 12:37)
support scyther has (12:35 - 12:40)
xspeed all which is amazing (12:37 - 12:42)
and strike together which raises the (12:40 - 12:44)
attack and speed of all allied sync (12:42 - 12:46)
pairs so like those two things (12:44 - 12:50)
right there are super strong for support (12:46 - 12:53)
um fury cutter is the uh (12:50 - 12:57)
x scissor is is good um you know for two (12:53 - 12:58)
cost (12:57 - 13:00)
50 power it's pretty good like i guess (12:58 - 13:02)
fury cutter is supposed to (13:00 - 13:04)
increase each time you use it but it (13:02 - 13:08)
starts to low it starts at nine (13:04 - 13:10)
like not going to sit and there's a 95 (13:08 - 13:11)
percent accuracy (13:10 - 13:13)
but i think x speed all and strike (13:11 - 13:15)
together are the things that (13:13 - 13:17)
make that scyther really good because (13:15 - 13:19)
support bedroll (13:17 - 13:22)
is x defense which is not great (13:19 - 13:24)
does have strike together which is good (13:22 - 13:27)
poison sting which is really weak (13:24 - 13:29)
i just think like if you're going to use (13:27 - 13:30)
one to fill in the support (13:29 - 13:33)
go try to get a support scyther some (13:30 - 13:35)
other mobile news here pokemon cafe mix (13:33 - 13:37)
also with an update i haven't played in (13:35 - 13:39)

runs close combat in (21:02 - 21:07)
the video game braviary doesn't have (21:04 - 21:08)
arms (21:07 - 21:10)
hey it's not saying close combat needs (21:08 - 21:12)
arms it's saying that they're close (21:10 - 21:13)
and they're combating you it's a (21:12 - 21:15)
fighting type move (21:13 - 21:17)

that thing you run in and you punch that (21:17 - 21:20)

they are no they're not no (23:27 - 23:33)
who is in this game anymore (23:30 - 23:33)
well it's not like they've added anybody (23:34 - 23:38)
i know but like i played it on the wii u (23:36 - 23:39)
i'm pretty sure and then (23:38 - 23:40)
forgot about it and didn't they add (23:39 - 23:42)
people i played it on wii u and i beat (23:40 - 23:44)
steve and that's when he stopped playing (23:42 - 23:48)
oh that's true i retired will (23:44 - 23:52)
will is the better fighting type bravery (23:48 - 23:53)
i'm pretty sure that did they have (23:52 - 23:56)
decidueye when i played it uh (23:53 - 23:59)
blastoise i think is the newest one i'm (23:56 - 24:00)
not sure what trace is in this (23:59 - 24:03)
yeah yeah it's part of the dlc is it (24:00 - 24:06)
supposed to be in this picture (24:03 - 24:08)
no it's not in the picture blastoise and (24:06 - 24:10)
one other pokemon got added (24:08 - 24:14)
i don't remember anything about look (24:10 - 24:17)
i i i'm gonna (24:14 - 24:19)
dx i'm gonna guess that this was always (24:17 - 24:21)
planned uh because (24:19 - 24:23)
worlds would have been around this time (24:21 - 24:24)
true and (24:23 - 24:26)
people probably would have watched it's (24:24 - 24:27)
really easy to watch a fighting game (24:26 - 24:29)
uh it's much easier to watch a fighting (24:27 - 24:30)
game than it is the tcg (24:29 - 24:33)
or the video game and so i'm assuming (24:30 - 24:34)
that this was always planned because (24:33 - 24:36)
people would have watched worlds they (24:34 - 24:37)
would have got suckered in to be like (24:36 - 24:37)
well (24:37 - 24:39)
it's the only thing on the big screen is (24:37 - 24:40)
pokken tournament we waiting for the (24:39 - 24:42)
next match so might as well watch it (24:40 - 24:44)
and then they go oh during the (24:42 - 24:46)
intermission they go there's a free (24:44 - 24:46)
trial (24:46 - 24:48)
on switch and you go well it's free i (24:46 - 24:49)
might as well download it (24:48 - 24:51)
um so i think this was always planned i (24:49 - 24:52)
thought i don't think this was actually (24:51 - 24:54)
out of nowhere it's just there's no (24:52 - 24:56)
world tournament to line this up with (24:54 - 24:58)
there are a lot of battlers well i mean (24:56 - 24:59)
it's a tournament (24:58 - 25:02)
there's no blast toys in this game yes (24:59 - 25:03)
there's a bully on (25:02 - 25:06)
blastoise is in the game i promise you (25:03 - 25:09)
is it in the dlc yes okay (25:06 - 25:13)
it was like a dlc 2-pack (25:09 - 25:15)
and blastoise was the second character i (25:13 - 25:17)
can't remember the first one (25:15 - 25:20)
it was a two pack oh egypt yeah it was a (25:17 - 25:21)
battle (25:20 - 25:23)
so you had to it was twenty dollars and (25:21 - 25:24)
it came with two characters (25:23 - 25:26)
so the first wave was aegis slash and (25:24 - 25:27)
then egypt (25:26 - 25:30)
support pokemon were uh mega rayquaza (25:27 - 25:31)
and mimikyu (25:30 - 25:35)
and then the second one was blastoise (25:31 - 25:37)
and then blastoise's support characters (25:35 - 25:37)
were mew (25:37 - 25:40)
and celebi that's okay i'm east coast (25:37 - 25:41)
not west coast (25:40 - 25:44)
so and it was i believe it was 1999 for (25:41 - 25:45)
the (25:44 - 25:48)
dlc for two characters jeez (25:45 - 25:50)
and i all right pretty sure people were (25:48 - 25:52)
upset about it being 20 bucks (25:50 - 25:55)
oh decidueye was added to the switch (25:52 - 25:58)

let me know when it's question time all (27:21 - 27:24)
right (27:23 - 27:27)
okay we got some world-class writing (27:24 - 27:29)
with this one too you don't need to be a (27:27 - 27:31)
psychic to know that something new has (27:29 - 27:33)
arrived in the pokemon center (27:31 - 27:36)
it's espeon the latest figure of funko's (27:33 - 27:38)
an afternoon with evie and friends (27:36 - 27:40)
this monthly series of collectible (27:38 - 27:41)
highlights evie and each (27:40 - 27:44)
evolution's pokemon's multiple forms and (27:41 - 27:46)
this month's star is the psychic type (27:44 - 27:46)
pokemon (27:46 - 27:48)
true to its pokedex category the (27:46 - 27:50)
adorable sun pokemon can be seen (27:48 - 27:52)
chilling out on a rock while basking in (27:50 - 27:54)
the warm ray of the sun (27:52 - 27:57)
espeon does after all use the orb on its (27:54 - 27:58)
forehead (27:57 - 28:00)
to harness a glow of the sun in order to (27:58 - 28:01)
build up power (28:00 - 28:04)
does this pokemon's subtle smirk means (28:01 - 28:06)
mean that it's simply enjoying the (28:04 - 28:07)
serene scene (28:06 - 28:09)
or is its grand due to its growing (28:07 - 28:12)
confidence that its mental might (28:09 - 28:14)
will help it defeat its opponents that's (28:12 - 28:16)
up for you to decide or (28:14 - 28:18)
is it going to wreck your house there's (28:16 - 28:20)
a limited quality of these figures (28:18 - 28:22)
available so head over to pokemon center (28:20 - 28:26)
quality quantity (28:22 - 28:26)
limit quality (28:26 - 28:31)
yeah sometimes they're good sometimes (28:29 - 28:35)
those are probably accurate (28:31 - 28:36)
i mean you guys bought the christmas (28:35 - 28:39)
train the christmas trend was much worse (28:36 - 28:40)
than the (28:39 - 28:42)
day with pikachu figures all right is it (28:40 - 28:44)
question time yet yeah it's a question (28:42 - 28:44)
you can ask (28:44 - 28:48)
okay hit my question is (28:44 - 28:53)
why why did they have to do espeon dirty (28:48 - 28:57)
because greg you will understand this (28:53 - 29:01)
okay steve you will not understand this (28:57 - 29:05)
this is clearly the sculptor's (29:01 - 29:08)
intent is to demonstrate that (29:05 - 29:12)
espeon is narcissus (29:08 - 29:12)
staring at his reflection in the puddle (29:12 - 29:17)
and that is all he cares about and he is (29:15 - 29:19)
lost in his own reflection (29:17 - 29:22)
joyce merkin how rude (29:19 - 29:26)
espeon is a sweet lovable it gives its (29:22 - 29:27)
all for its trainer it is not (29:26 - 29:28)
self-obsessed (29:27 - 29:31)
and solipsistic i mean as long as you (29:28 - 29:33)
keep it away from a puddle you're fine (29:31 - 29:33)
but (29:33 - 29:36)
now we know it's true weakness is it's (29:33 - 29:40)
its own image scary (29:36 - 29:40)
i just the minute i saw it i was like i (29:42 - 29:46)
can't believe (29:45 - 29:47)
like are all the other afternoon with (29:46 - 29:49)
eevee like greek myths (29:47 - 29:54)
as well i don't know how do i find them (29:49 - 29:56)
you've just clicked on the link i no see (29:54 - 29:57)
i don't see it because like (29:56 - 30:00)
what flareon's like sniffing a leaf and (29:57 - 30:01)
glacion's like (30:00 - 30:02)
i made some ice where there's not some (30:01 - 30:05)
ice supposed to be (30:02 - 30:07)
sylveon's just happy and dancing and (30:05 - 30:08)
they've done the done (30:07 - 30:12)
espeon dirty flareons burning two (30:08 - 30:15)
berries sure it is why is it burning two (30:12 - 30:15)
berries (30:15 - 30:17)
you gotta cook them before you eat them (30:15 - 30:20)
dude and that horror horrible (30:17 - 30:22)
vaporeon which never should have been (30:20 - 30:24)
made that oh (30:22 - 30:26)
it gives me the shivers every single (30:24 - 30:28)
time (30:26 - 30:31)
uh i yeah (30:28 - 30:34)
i i'm just so disappointed don't you (30:31 - 30:35)
think that's beyond should have been (30:34 - 30:35)
like (30:35 - 30:38)
floating or just like smiling and happy (30:35 - 30:40)
like sylveon is (30:38 - 30:43)
ugh there's no it's no sylveon though (30:40 - 30:46)
so that's no maybe that's why it's just (30:43 - 30:48)
wrapped up in its own image because it (30:46 - 30:51)
didn't get the ribbons it's sad (30:48 - 30:53)
it wants to be better it's thinking (30:51 - 30:54)
trainer (30:53 - 30:57)
why didn't you make me sylvia i guess (30:54 - 31:00)
there you go all right it was a (30:57 - 31:01)
rhetorical question steve there's no (31:00 - 31:03)
true answer to this (31:01 - 31:06)
i figured if you put the vaporeon and (31:03 - 31:08)
the espn together does their water match (31:06 - 31:09)
up (31:08 - 31:13)
uh glacion also has water (31:09 - 31:13)
go into a circle or something they must (31:14 - 31:21)
probably yeah i yeah (31:17 - 31:23)
i would see it with the original little (31:21 - 31:24)
eevee (31:23 - 31:27)
uh one in the middle maybe yeah with the (31:24 - 31:29)
two eevees (31:27 - 31:31)
somebody buy all of them and then take a (31:29 - 31:32)
picture of it for me (31:31 - 31:34)
thank you i bet he's already been doing (31:32 - 31:36)
it no i haven't bought anything i'm not (31:34 - 31:38)
a huge eevee fan (31:36 - 31:41)
what's your pikachu fan yeah i like the (31:38 - 31:42)
pikachu (31:41 - 31:44)
me and pikachu go way back too late now (31:42 - 31:45)
because flareon (31:44 - 31:50)
sold out correct don't tell me that (31:45 - 31:51)
that's because they only made like 20 (31:50 - 31:53)
flareon because they didn't need to they (31:51 - 31:54)
would they do (31:53 - 31:58)
don't start barely (31:54 - 32:00)
sold out glaceon sold out people are (31:58 - 32:02)

so mad at you right now what what did i (34:08 - 34:13)
do you put rosalia against lapras (34:10 - 34:16)
oh rosalia wasn't that easy oh lapras (34:13 - 34:17)
g-max's (34:16 - 34:21)
lapras is goofy looking (34:17 - 34:23)

lapras i can ride it and get a pool (34:24 - 34:28)
floatie (34:26 - 34:32)
done be dirty i think roselia will win (34:28 - 34:33)
this one (34:32 - 34:34)
i think yeah i think rosalie will be (34:33 - 34:36)
fine against lapras the real the real (34:34 - 34:39)
question is lick a tongue for slow (34:36 - 34:42)
yeah that one i okay i stared (34:39 - 34:45)
okay i stared at that one and could not (34:42 - 34:46)
decide (34:45 - 34:48)
it's tough for a very long time the (34:46 - 34:50)
other one that killed me was sable i (34:48 - 34:51)
versus farfetch'd (34:50 - 34:55)
yeah that one's tough too i there are (34:51 - 34:57)
how is that tough say bly wins i mean (34:55 - 34:58)
table eye wins in my heart all the time (34:57 - 34:59)
but (34:58 - 35:02)
people who follow steve are we like (34:59 - 35:05)
farfetch though wait is it glarion (35:02 - 35:06)
far-fetched original far-fetched (35:05 - 35:07)
original (35:06 - 35:11)
garbage throw it in the trash (35:07 - 35:13)
i mean there is no contest between (35:11 - 35:15)
golduck and quillfish (35:13 - 35:17)
yeah cool fish all the way it is the (35:15 - 35:18)
year of the cool fish (35:17 - 35:20)
it's the year of the goal stuck all the (35:18 - 35:22)
way you threw a master ball to catch (35:20 - 35:24)
your gold duck (35:22 - 35:27)
yeah that's the olden days everything (35:24 - 35:29)
this is this is too upsetting i gotta (35:27 - 35:31)
get it i'm sorry times change (35:29 - 35:33)
people change with the times roll with (35:31 - 35:35)
it it's a rough bracket there's one (35:33 - 35:37)
pokemon i think i want to win (35:35 - 35:42)
really bad but i cannot reveal it oh (35:37 - 35:44)
interesting it's probably something that (35:42 - 35:46)
g max is because you actually care about (35:44 - 35:47)
that (35:46 - 35:50)
g-maxing is cool um but also (35:47 - 35:53)
this this is my hint this ribbon pokemon (35:50 - 35:57)
has to do a lot of battling look (35:53 - 35:59)
a lot of battling and there are some (35:57 - 36:00)
pokemon in that list (35:59 - 36:03)
that cannot hold their weight in battle (36:00 - 36:04)
at all (36:03 - 36:07)
pokemon of the week is my thing get out (36:04 - 36:07)
of (36:07 - 36:10)
my box (36:07 - 36:14)
you don't do hints and allegations but (36:10 - 36:16)
you also have to do a lot of contests (36:14 - 36:18)
and there are certain pokemon on this (36:16 - 36:19)
list (36:18 - 36:21)
that are going to be way better at that (36:19 - 36:22)
rosalia (36:21 - 36:25)
melodic milotic please (36:22 - 36:28)
it is not like a tongue i don't think (36:25 - 36:29)
phoebus or milotic were (36:28 - 36:33)
ever shadow pokemon i don't think so uh (36:29 - 36:34)
it'll be interesting (36:33 - 36:36)
uh i'm i'm i don't want to slog through (36:34 - 36:37)
get (36:36 - 36:38)
the gale of darkness would be a (36:37 - 36:40)
significantly better game (36:38 - 36:43)
if they removed two-thirds of the (36:40 - 36:44)
battles (36:43 - 36:48)
there are so many battles (36:44 - 36:51)
wait in a game about pokemon battling (36:48 - 36:54)
there are too many that's like saying in (36:51 - 36:55)
pokken tournament (36:54 - 36:57)
there are too many tournaments and not (36:55 - 36:59)
enough clothes (36:57 - 37:01)
combat in pokken tournament that's the (36:59 - 37:02)
problem (37:01 - 37:04)
[Music] (37:02 - 37:06)
darkness is a great game when when you (37:04 - 37:08)
remove the catching mechanic (37:06 - 37:12)
or you make it so gimmicky that you're (37:08 - 37:14)
only catching like once every hour in (37:12 - 37:14)
that game (37:14 - 37:16)
instead of you know however much you (37:14 - 37:18)
want in a main series game (37:16 - 37:22)
and you only focus on the battling you (37:18 - 37:23)
realize (37:22 - 37:27)
there's just too much battling (37:23 - 37:27)
you are the worst look if (37:29 - 37:34)
if if there was a better selection of (37:32 - 37:36)
pokemon if there's a better move (37:34 - 37:37)
selection maybe the battling wouldn't be (37:36 - 37:38)
that bad (37:37 - 37:40)
don't even get me started on low tad (37:38 - 37:42)
don't even get me started on the amount (37:40 - 37:44)
of low tad you have to slay (37:42 - 37:47)
to get through the end look every game (37:44 - 37:51)
has its low tad so that's just a pokemon (37:47 - 37:52)
standard (37:51 - 37:53)
how many low tide do you think are in (37:52 - 37:55)
gale darkness i'm gonna say at least 80 (37:53 - 37:56)
that you have to knock out (37:55 - 37:58)
i can honestly say i never played gale (37:56 - 38:00)
of darkness because i never had a game (37:58 - 38:02)
this is this is what i need i need a (38:00 - 38:04)
we're fighting low tad counter and i (38:02 - 38:04)
need to (38:04 - 38:07)
i need to we're fighting any pokemon (38:04 - 38:09)
that is not low tad counter (38:07 - 38:11)
and i guarantee you the low tad counter (38:09 - 38:12)
will be higher at the end of that game (38:11 - 38:14)
you are in control of this happening set (38:12 - 38:17)
it up i will set it up (38:14 - 38:19)
they should call it that on your twitch (38:17 - 38:23)
stream gail of low dad (38:19 - 38:23)
low dad of darkness all right i mean but (38:24 - 38:29)
mirror be though mirror be though (38:27 - 38:30)
let me say one good thing about gale (38:29 - 38:33)
darkness it has good music (38:30 - 38:35)
oh it has great music the amount of (38:33 - 38:37)
people who were like (38:35 - 38:39)
what is this song and the minute the (38:37 - 38:40)
minute the video started i'm like oh (38:39 - 38:42)
dang i love this song (38:40 - 38:45)
it's so good i think kayla darkness (38:42 - 38:46)
socks are so good i (38:45 - 38:49)
made i made it so jazzy i made a trailer (38:46 - 38:51)
very proud of it spent several hours on (38:49 - 38:52)
it i love to make little like (38:51 - 38:54)
announcement trailers for when we do big (38:52 - 38:55)
things on twitch (38:54 - 38:58)
and so because it was a ribbon quest (38:55 - 39:01)
i found all the stock footage of of like (38:58 - 39:03)
these ribbons falling from the sky and (39:01 - 39:05)
stuff and i was like okay cool (39:03 - 39:08)
um i'll use that because i'm not going (39:05 - 39:11)
to use pokemon footage or whatever (39:08 - 39:12)
and uh i was like well i'll pick a gale (39:11 - 39:14)
darkness song so you know when (39:12 - 39:15)
somebody's watching it (39:14 - 39:16)
once once they hear the song and they've (39:15 - 39:18)
played gale darkness they'll know right (39:16 - 39:19)
off the bat right (39:18 - 39:22)
and then you know if if the viewer is (39:19 - 39:23)
savvy enough in the first couple seconds (39:22 - 39:25)
they'll be like oh this is ribbon (39:23 - 39:27)
steve must be doing a ribbon quest (39:25 - 39:28)
because this is something we've talked (39:27 - 39:28)
about for (39:28 - 39:31)
for years is to do a ribbon quest you (39:28 - 39:33)
know a very big time consuming project (39:31 - 39:35)
and b and there were there i didn't (39:33 - 39:37)
think about this there was a third set (39:35 - 39:37)
of (39:37 - 39:40)
people that didn't know gail of (39:37 - 39:41)
darkness's (39:40 - 39:44)
music and didn't put like didn't (39:41 - 39:45)

most (42:08 - 42:12)
english of names yeah it is it's like (42:08 - 42:14)
england distilled into one name nigel (42:12 - 42:15)
brooks (42:14 - 42:18)
was given the set as a gift from his (42:15 - 42:21)
mother as his appreciation for hard work (42:18 - 42:23)
and what he did for looking after his (42:21 - 42:24)
little brother his bro (42:23 - 42:27)

out of some of the best cards by shady (42:27 - 42:30)
local kids this is (42:29 - 42:34)
your dad grade a journalism here um (42:30 - 42:36)
quote i found the kids and got my (42:34 - 42:38)
brother's cards back so as a present my (42:36 - 42:39)
mom (42:38 - 42:40)
bought me this rare collection direct (42:39 - 42:43)
from pokemon creators in the u.s for (42:40 - 42:44)
about 300 pounds (42:43 - 42:48)
brooke told the mirror i wasn't actually (42:44 - 42:50)
interested in pokemon i was disappointed (42:48 - 42:51)
at the time because they didn't include (42:50 - 42:53)
all the pokemon in the national decks oh (42:51 - 42:54)
wait no that's not what it says (42:53 - 42:56)
i was disappointed at the time would you (42:54 - 42:58)
stop because (42:56 - 43:02)
click bait i was disappointed at the (42:58 - 43:04)
time because the collection was one of (43:02 - 43:05)
my birthday presents (43:04 - 43:10)
so to me it was a waste of a present (43:05 - 43:13)
recognizing they may be someday worth (43:10 - 43:14)
something someday (43:13 - 43:15)
brooks hung on to them but until (43:14 - 43:17)
recently (43:15 - 43:20)
had uh after his daughter offered to buy (43:17 - 43:20)
them off (43:20 - 43:23)
for six pounds he decided to go and get (43:20 - 43:24)
them officially valued (43:23 - 43:27)
the complete 103 first gen (43:24 - 43:30)
first and first gen set which the mother (43:27 - 43:31)
paid for 380 (43:30 - 43:34)
usd is now estimated (43:31 - 43:38)
at between 31 000 to 44 000 (43:34 - 43:41)
usd at least my kids are growing up i (43:38 - 43:42)
want to be able to give them really a (43:41 - 43:44)
special childhood so with this money we (43:42 - 43:46)
can really set ourselves up for the (43:44 - 43:46)
future (43:46 - 43:49)
brooks says of his decided decision to (43:46 - 43:50)
sell (43:49 - 43:52)
although this article doesn't say if he (43:50 - 43:54)
did sell it (43:52 - 43:56)
also this article doesn't say i'm (43:54 - 43:58)
assuming the cards are probably first (43:56 - 43:59)
edition (43:58 - 44:01)
oh yeah they must be to be worth that (43:59 - 44:03)
much yeah i mean 30k is a good chunk of (44:01 - 44:05)
change (44:03 - 44:08)
well it'll get you half half tuition at (44:05 - 44:10)
an american universe yeah i was gonna (44:08 - 44:12)
say i don't know what colleges are (44:10 - 44:15)
costed in the uk but 30 000 is yeah (44:12 - 44:15)
about (44:15 - 44:18)
all right number two world's most (44:15 - 44:20)
expensive pokemon card (44:18 - 44:23)
sells for 250 (44:20 - 44:27)
this will get you a tuition yeah (44:23 - 44:30)
yeah it gave me a lot of things what (44:27 - 44:33)
the newest world record pokemon card (44:30 - 44:34)
sale (44:33 - 44:36)
took place earlier this month at zen (44:34 - 44:38)
plus an american customer (44:36 - 44:41)
did purchase the pokemon illustrator (44:38 - 44:41)
card (44:41 - 44:44)
for 250 000 (44:41 - 44:47)
we've talked about this card before it's (44:44 - 44:49)
sold before (44:47 - 44:51)
uh the last one sold in 2019 which we (44:49 - 44:52)
did cover (44:51 - 44:54)
for a hundred and ninety five thousand (44:52 - 44:55)
dollars (44:54 - 44:58)
i i doesn't say if this is the same card (44:55 - 44:58)
being sold (44:58 - 45:00)
i think we know that there's not a lot (44:58 - 45:03)
of these in existence anymore (45:00 - 45:04)
that's pretty much the entire article it (45:03 - 45:08)
just this is not the most expensive (45:04 - 45:11)
the most expensive card was this card at (45:08 - 45:13)
195k (45:11 - 45:15)
last year this card is still now the (45:13 - 45:17)
most expensive card (45:15 - 45:21)
at 250k this year (45:17 - 45:22)
um and if you don't know what the (45:21 - 45:24)
illustrator card is it was a card (45:22 - 45:28)
that was given out in japan only for a (45:24 - 45:29)
contest (45:28 - 45:31)
it was like an illustration contest 39 (45:29 - 45:32)
people won (45:31 - 45:36)
the card in 1998 (45:32 - 45:39)
only 39 of these cards apparently exist (45:36 - 45:42)
how many of them are in the garbage or (45:39 - 45:44)
lost the time or had water spilled on (45:42 - 45:45)
them or (45:44 - 45:47)
in somebody's attic never to be seen (45:45 - 45:49)
again i don't know probably half of them (45:47 - 45:52)
probably maybe at least two of them uh (45:49 - 45:53)
we don't know how many cards are (45:52 - 45:56)
left in existence people love those (45:53 - 45:57)
expensive cards (45:56 - 45:58)
i don't know maybe next week we'll have (45:57 - 46:01)
another one of this card sold for 300 (45:58 - 46:06)
000 i would find that hard to believe (46:01 - 46:09)
two sword and shield articles here first (46:06 - 46:11)
one being bothoffpokemon.com (46:09 - 46:13)

battles oh that's when you gotta swap (46:31 - 46:35)
the pokemons in and out all the time (46:33 - 46:37)
yeah you gotta use the toxic you gotta (46:35 - 46:39)
you know (46:37 - 46:41)
the dynamics the tournament will take (46:39 - 46:42)
place july 23rd (46:41 - 46:45)

don't know (46:54 - 46:57)
they really like to throw it all in the (46:55 - 46:59)
same week well it's like (46:57 - 47:00)
you're not even allowed to have a life (46:59 - 47:03)
anymore you've just got to be pokemon 24 (47:00 - 47:07)
7. wait till sleep comes up (47:03 - 47:11)
where is it give me give me my sleep (47:07 - 47:14)
i need to sleep i what happened to that (47:11 - 47:15)
program (47:14 - 47:18)
seriously sleep and detective (47:15 - 47:21)
yeah my my guess on sleep (47:18 - 47:24)
is because uh the factories had to shut (47:21 - 47:26)
down in china for so long (47:24 - 47:30)
that they couldn't make the devices yet (47:26 - 47:30)
what devices you know that much (47:30 - 47:35)
there was a little thing you you put on (47:33 - 47:37)
your bed yeah it was called the pokemon (47:35 - 47:38)
go plus (47:37 - 47:41)
plus remember it had a beautiful name oh (47:38 - 47:42)
that's right the place i had (47:41 - 47:44)
i had to wipe that out of my memory (47:42 - 47:45)
because it was so bad (47:44 - 47:46)
so you can't launch a mobile app if you (47:45 - 47:48)
don't have the dumb little (47:46 - 47:50)
plastic thing to put on your pillow the (47:48 - 47:51)
dongle (47:50 - 47:54)
no dongle no dice that would be that is (47:51 - 47:55)
my guess is they couldn't (47:54 - 47:59)
the the dongle's not done being made (47:55 - 48:02)
we gotta get an insider out in china to (47:59 - 48:03)
check on (48:02 - 48:06)
dongle chinese listeners (48:03 - 48:08)
find the dongle let us know where the (48:06 - 48:09)
dongle is (48:08 - 48:11)
single battles this weekend by the time (48:09 - 48:13)
this podcast goes up tournament will be (48:11 - 48:14)
over but that happened 50 battle points (48:13 - 48:15)
don't worry you didn't miss out on a (48:14 - 48:17)
shirt we will definitely let you know (48:15 - 48:19)
when another bald guy shirt is coming (48:17 - 48:22)
oh for sure luxury ball guy is the one i (48:19 - 48:23)
am waiting (48:22 - 48:26)
for oh i'll be in that tournament (48:23 - 48:28)
uh maybe you haven't bought the dlc yet (48:26 - 48:30)
maybe you're unsure what it (48:28 - 48:33)
includes pokemon.com here kind of (48:30 - 48:36)
really lists everything that the dlc has (48:33 - 48:38)
so we'll go through it real quick just a (48:36 - 48:40)
friendly reminder uh first one is you (48:38 - 48:43)
can get rare items with the cram-o-matic (48:40 - 48:47)
it says hopefully after it too the (48:43 - 48:50)
scam-o-matic gamma-matic yeah (48:47 - 48:50)
well you'll spend most of your time on (48:50 - 48:54)
the isle of armor working with the dojo (48:52 - 48:56)
master mustard and his wife (48:54 - 48:58)
it's their son who may keep you coming (48:56 - 48:59)
back (48:58 - 49:01)
thanks to the bizarre item combining (48:59 - 49:03)
contraption (49:01 - 49:04)
you'll have to give them just some watts (49:03 - 49:05)
to get it started but as you might (49:04 - 49:07)
expect this device that isn't (49:05 - 49:10)
even functional when you arrive is a bit (49:07 - 49:11)
unreliable (49:10 - 49:13)
with a bit of luck the cram-o-matic can (49:11 - 49:15)
churn out some rare items (49:13 - 49:17)
otherwise you can only get unlimited (49:15 - 49:18)
qualities quantities (49:17 - 49:20)
or quality quality of the item is pretty (49:18 - 49:22)
bad too (49:20 - 49:25)
to use the chromomatic insert four items (49:22 - 49:27)
cross your fingers as a strange device (49:25 - 49:28)
combines them hopefully you get an item (49:27 - 49:30)
that is rare than what you put in (49:28 - 49:32)
this process can create such cool items (49:30 - 49:33)
as rare candies (49:32 - 49:35)
to make ability capsules or bottle caps (49:33 - 49:37)
to make gold bottle caps (49:35 - 49:40)
but while you may but what may be the (49:37 - 49:42)
most interesting is the ability to make (49:40 - 49:44)
rare poke balls like heavy balls love (49:42 - 49:45)
balls or even (49:44 - 49:49)
safari and sport balls (49:45 - 49:49)
to make these items is that on your (49:49 - 49:52)
infographic it is it is (49:51 - 49:55)
okay infographic thank you to make the (49:52 - 49:56)
uh (49:55 - 49:57)
sport ball and safari bar a one in a (49:56 - 50:00)
thousand chance (49:57 - 50:03)
so rude well it's less (50:00 - 50:04)
easier to find than a shiny pokemon (50:03 - 50:07)
technically how do i get my ball charm (50:04 - 50:10)
uh no ball charm yet to make these items (50:07 - 50:11)
you'll have to find the appropriate (50:10 - 50:12)
colored apricorns on the island (50:11 - 50:13)
combining them (50:12 - 50:15)
making pokeballs this way is not quite (50:13 - 50:17)
as reliable as the process (50:15 - 50:20)
kurt used in the johto region's azealia (50:17 - 50:22)
town (50:20 - 50:24)
and i think actually when you make your (50:22 - 50:25)
first apricorn ball like let's say you (50:24 - 50:27)
pop out a love ball (50:25 - 50:31)
um what's his name what's that kid's (50:27 - 50:31)
name (50:31 - 50:35)
charlie no it was like milo or something (50:31 - 50:37)
no it wasn't milo (50:35 - 50:40)
no it had nothing to do with mustard (50:37 - 50:42)
and you guys looked it up for me and i (50:40 - 50:44)
was just so disappointed (50:42 - 50:46)
it's like when is it wendell though it's (50:44 - 50:47)
something mayo (50:46 - 50:52)
uh he'll he'll pretty much tell you that (50:47 - 50:53)
like (50:52 - 50:56)
uh kurt visited one time and the thing (50:53 - 50:58)
doesn't make him as good as kurt or (50:56 - 50:59)
something like that he gives you some (50:58 - 51:02)
dialogue about kurt (50:59 - 51:02)
uh teach your new pokemon hide hi (51:03 - 51:10)
yeah there you go hide as the sun hide (51:07 - 51:11)
the honey mustard (51:10 - 51:14)
teach your pokemon new incredible moves (51:11 - 51:15)
after you get to a certain point into (51:14 - 51:17)
the adventure you'll find one of mustard (51:15 - 51:19)
students is willing to teach (51:17 - 51:21)
your pokemon some never-before-seen (51:19 - 51:23)
moves (51:21 - 51:25)
as long as you're willing to cough up (51:23 - 51:27)
ten sorry five (51:25 - 51:29)
pieces of armorite ore per move might (51:27 - 51:30)
seem like a high price (51:29 - 51:32)
it's not if you haven't spent a lot of (51:30 - 51:34)
time (51:32 - 51:34)
moves are worth it unlike move tutors of (51:34 - 51:40)
past pokemon adventures this fellow (51:38 - 51:42)
teaches moves that no pokemon have ever (51:40 - 51:44)
been able to learn before (51:42 - 51:46)
each of these moves are very impactful (51:44 - 51:47)
especially when used in battles against (51:46 - 51:49)
your friends or online players (51:47 - 51:52)
the most one of them close combat no (51:49 - 51:54)
never before seen moves (51:52 - 51:56)
okay most of these moves fall under two (51:54 - 51:58)
categories multi-hit attacks like (51:56 - 52:02)
dual wing beat or triple and triple axel (51:58 - 52:04)
that seem to fit the martial arts theme (52:02 - 52:05)
of the dojo (52:04 - 52:07)
and the trickier attacks like grassy (52:05 - 52:09)
glide expanding force (52:07 - 52:12)
and burning jealousy that have their (52:09 - 52:13)
full effect in battle (52:12 - 52:15)
when certain conditions are happening (52:13 - 52:16)
those three moves are (52:15 - 52:19)
incredibly popular uh (52:16 - 52:21)
if only avery were able to create some (52:19 - 52:24)
psychic terrain for you (52:21 - 52:25)
if you were looking for some more armor (52:24 - 52:27)
right ore if you do well in ranked (52:25 - 52:28)
battle (52:27 - 52:29)
and you want to invest teaching your (52:28 - 52:31)
pokemon some of these news attacks you (52:29 - 52:32)
gotta spend armor right or to make arma (52:31 - 52:33)
rador (52:32 - 52:35)
they're referring to here is if you make (52:33 - 52:37)
it to master rank in either double (52:35 - 52:40)
or singles or both you will get 30 (52:37 - 52:41)
armorite ore for (52:40 - 52:43)
the end of the season but you get about (52:41 - 52:45)
one to two armor right or per (52:43 - 52:48)
max raid battle so it's they're not hard (52:45 - 52:49)
to get (52:48 - 52:51)
yeah but then i got to do max raid (52:49 - 52:53)
battles you could have got that shiny (52:51 - 52:55)
whalered (52:53 - 52:58)
coulda shoulda went up yeah (52:55 - 53:00)
when everybody has a shiny waylord it's (52:58 - 53:02)
not special no one has that (53:00 - 53:05)
they're just they're just giving it away (53:02 - 53:05)
uh (53:05 - 53:08)
what about collecting non-native forms (53:05 - 53:10)
of pokemon from galler (53:08 - 53:12)
uh some pokemon native to geller have (53:10 - 53:13)
different forms that can be found in (53:12 - 53:15)
other regions if you don't (53:13 - 53:16)
have a huge backlog of pokemon and (53:15 - 53:18)
pokemon home you might be wondering how (53:16 - 53:20)
to get some of these on your teams worry (53:18 - 53:21)
not there are two different ways to add (53:20 - 53:24)
these pokemon to your collection (53:21 - 53:26)
uh number one as you journey across the (53:24 - 53:28)
island of armor you will meet a trainer (53:26 - 53:31)
looking to trade glaring regionals (53:28 - 53:33)
forms gallerian regional forms of meowth (53:31 - 53:35)
ponyta mr mime and others in exchange (53:33 - 53:38)

it isn't just the pokemon with gallerian (53:38 - 53:41)
forms that you can trade this way you (53:40 - 53:44)
also will be able to trade exeggutor or (53:41 - 53:46)
marowak for the alolan region variants (53:44 - 53:47)
that's really good for people who (53:46 - 53:48)
haven't played (53:47 - 53:50)
sun and moon if you're looking for even (53:48 - 53:52)
more regional variants (53:50 - 53:54)
you will meet a man who is crazy about (53:52 - 53:57)
alolan diglett as you start your (53:54 - 53:57)
adventure (53:57 - 54:00)
you can help him seek out 151 missing (53:57 - 54:02)
alolan diglett (54:00 - 54:03)

collection with many rare pokemon (54:03 - 54:07)
including alolan vulpix (54:05 - 54:09)
slowpoke found outside the isle of armor (54:07 - 54:10)
and other regional variants (54:09 - 54:12)

hidden abilities and there will be (54:12 - 54:16)
uh and better than normal individual (54:14 - 54:17)
strengths too (54:16 - 54:18)

just don't get obsessed with it like (54:35 - 54:38)
that guy is (54:37 - 54:40)
there's no such thing as a diglett (54:38 - 54:43)
that's excellent in battle (54:40 - 54:43)
[Applause] (54:45 - 54:50)

and i'm like missing three and i've like (55:17 - 55:21)
i (55:20 - 55:23)
had to sit down and get a guide because (55:21 - 55:25)
i don't know where they are and i can't (55:23 - 55:26)
be bothered (55:25 - 55:29)
like with the if i was getting a shirt (55:26 - 55:30)
i'd be all for it (55:29 - 55:31)
knowing what i'm actually getting i'm (55:30 - 55:33)
like i can wait yeah i already got one (55:31 - 55:34)
of them (55:33 - 55:36)
i got a lot of them i can go play the (55:34 - 55:38)
game where i can get a lot more for free (55:36 - 55:41)
yeah i have to get 151 on my own and (55:38 - 55:42)
transfer them over (55:41 - 55:45)
familiar are you guys with digging ma (55:42 - 55:47)
and digging paw (55:45 - 55:50)
i don't like digging ma i like digging (55:47 - 55:51)
paw (55:50 - 55:54)
i don't know digging paws kind of like (55:51 - 55:59)
greedy if you explore to the wild area (55:54 - 56:00)
during your initial journey (55:59 - 56:02)
you probably met the digging duo a pair (56:00 - 56:04)
of brothers who would dig up items for (56:02 - 56:05)
watts (56:04 - 56:08)
uh on the island you can on the isle of (56:05 - 56:10)
armor you can encounter some new digging (56:08 - 56:12)
experts or perhaps some older ones (56:10 - 56:14)
digging paw and digging ma are on the (56:12 - 56:15)
job (56:14 - 56:17)
but they want currency more valuable (56:15 - 56:20)
than watts they want armor right ore (56:17 - 56:21)
you'll have an easier time finding (56:20 - 56:23)
digging paw who is outside the training (56:21 - 56:24)
low lance (56:23 - 56:26)
in exchange from armory door they'll dig (56:24 - 56:28)
you up some watts (56:26 - 56:29)
if you find yourself with a surplus of (56:28 - 56:31)
armor right ore uh (56:29 - 56:33)
he can help you turn it into watts to (56:31 - 56:34)
spend on other activities (56:33 - 56:38)
digging ma is a bit trickier to find (56:34 - 56:39)
as you'll have to hunt her down and (56:38 - 56:41)
she's in new locations each time (56:39 - 56:43)
you want her to dig she'll offer you a (56:41 - 56:45)
single piece of armory door or you can (56:43 - 56:47)
tell her to hold on to it to start (56:45 - 56:47)
digging (56:47 - 56:49)
choose the ladder and she'll dig for (56:47 - 56:50)
more armorite ore (56:49 - 56:53)
until you tell her to stop be careful (56:50 - 56:55)
her shovel can break at any time (56:53 - 56:57)
and you'll lose all the armorite or she (56:55 - 56:58)
found get lucky (56:57 - 57:00)
and you could end up with buckets of (56:58 - 57:02)
armored ore or you could get nothing (57:00 - 57:04)
i don't think i've gotten more than four (57:02 - 57:05)
armored ore from her (57:04 - 57:08)
i stopped she's she she has broken her (57:05 - 57:09)
shovel every single time (57:08 - 57:12)
yeah it's like no (57:09 - 57:14)
it's not worth it i lose everything i (57:12 - 57:16)
don't even keep the ones you found like (57:14 - 57:19)
what your shovel broke and then you (57:16 - 57:21)
re-buried all the order you found (57:19 - 57:24)
yeah exactly what what kind of terrible (57:21 - 57:25)
digger are you it's like well my shovel (57:24 - 57:27)
broke so i'm just going to fill in this (57:25 - 57:27)
hole (57:27 - 57:30)
let's not see my error i'm going to (57:27 - 57:32)
cover my sins so you don't get anything (57:30 - 57:35)
she's terrible it is exciting to find (57:32 - 57:35)
her (57:35 - 57:38)
she doesn't move around no it's not (57:35 - 57:42)
it's like no steer away from that scam (57:38 - 57:44)
that's worse than the machine and that's (57:42 - 57:45)
always there you know (57:44 - 57:47)
you don't like the digging ma digging (57:45 - 57:49)
paw prove that your older pokemon are (57:47 - 57:50)
battle ready (57:49 - 57:52)
i mean i like digging pot did you not (57:50 - 57:54)
even even cover digging pod did you did (57:52 - 57:54)
i miss it (57:54 - 57:56)
yeah yeah you did yeah it just says (57:54 - 57:58)
right for watts (57:56 - 58:02)
but like the you get all the watts yeah (57:58 - 58:03)
the shovel breaks (58:02 - 58:07)
but honey honey milks you dry (58:03 - 58:08)
yeah but then you get to go on a date (58:07 - 58:10)
with her so is that (58:08 - 58:13)
that's a married woman oh she don't care (58:10 - 58:15)
yeah she don't care (58:13 - 58:17)
she knows what she's about i don't know (58:15 - 58:18)
what world you people live in (58:17 - 58:21)
tell me about my old pokemon and how i'm (58:18 - 58:22)
going to revitalize (58:21 - 58:25)
them if you've transferred pokemon from (58:22 - 58:27)
a game other than sword and shield (58:25 - 58:29)
through pokemon home you may have (58:27 - 58:30)
noticed (58:29 - 58:32)
they may not be eligible for ranked (58:30 - 58:33)
battles in victory stadium (58:32 - 58:36)
or for most official competitions while (58:33 - 58:37)
in the past you would have to catch new (58:36 - 58:38)
pokemon for these battles (58:37 - 58:40)
a helpful new character in the back of (58:38 - 58:42)
the battle tower in winden can give you (58:40 - 58:44)
uh can give your imported pokemon a (58:42 - 58:46)
battle ready symbol allowing them to be (58:44 - 58:47)
used in battle (58:46 - 58:49)
that was previously restricted to (58:47 - 58:51)
pokemon caught or hatched in galler (58:49 - 58:53)
pokemon given the battle ready symbol (58:51 - 58:54)
will forget all their current moves (58:53 - 58:57)
and learn a new set it is possible some (58:54 - 58:59)
forgotten moves cannot be relearned so (58:57 - 59:01)
be careful (58:59 - 59:03)
we've talked about this dude before yeah (59:01 - 59:04)
he's good (59:03 - 59:07)
can we can we talk about the the the (59:04 - 59:08)
rumor (59:07 - 59:12)
of uh the isle of armor or sorry (59:08 - 59:14)
the crown tundra what's the rumor no (59:12 - 59:15)
yeah (59:14 - 59:19)
rumor rumored that will be in the game (59:15 - 59:21)
that the data miners found so we don't (59:19 - 59:22)
know if it's true or not (59:21 - 59:26)
it's not true but there the rumor (59:22 - 59:28)
is that there will be a hidden ability (59:26 - 59:29)
capsule (59:28 - 59:31)
in the crown tundra oh so even better (59:29 - 59:32)
than the mobility (59:31 - 59:37)
capsule yeah that is that is the rumor (59:32 - 59:39)
it's like i mean i'm there for a i mean (59:37 - 59:41)
when you're breeding for hidden (59:39 - 59:43)
ability or you found one with a mark but (59:41 - 59:45)
you know (59:43 - 59:47)
you can change it that's worth it that's (59:45 - 59:48)
way worth it (59:47 - 59:50)
yeah i mean it's one of probably the (59:48 - 59:51)
last two things that people have (59:50 - 59:52)
complained about which is (59:51 - 59:56)
hidden ability and um zero iv bottle (59:52 - 59:57)
caps are probably the (59:56 - 60:00)
only two competitive complaints as well (59:57 - 60:01)
and one specific (60:00 - 60:03)
this one specific twitch streamer goes (60:01 - 60:05)
on about the all the time (60:03 - 60:08)
a de-evolution spray and like oh yeah (60:05 - 60:09)
spray would be good too (60:08 - 60:12)
yeah what if you accidentally evolved uh (60:09 - 60:13)
you know your (60:12 - 60:14)
your dust skull all the way up to a dust (60:13 - 60:16)
clops then you realize that dust (60:14 - 60:17)
collapse is actually (60:16 - 60:21)
not or dust noir sorry (60:17 - 60:22)
and then you were like oh dust klopp's (60:21 - 60:24)
is actually better than dusk noir (60:22 - 60:27)
then you get good scrub and you gotta (60:24 - 60:28)
start all over again (60:27 - 60:30)
what if you accidentally caught a shiny (60:28 - 60:31)
pidgey and then you weren't paying (60:30 - 60:32)
attention then you evolved the pidgey (60:31 - 60:34)
into a pidgeotto but you wanted to be a (60:32 - 60:36)
pidgey forever (60:34 - 60:36)
catch another one i wonder okay so if (60:38 - 60:43)
they do do a hidden ability capsule i (60:41 - 60:44)
wonder what it would (60:43 - 60:46)
be like a hundred battle points 50 (60:44 - 60:48)
battle points like an ability capsule is (60:46 - 60:49)
already 50. (60:48 - 60:51)
well maybe it's not battle points at all (60:49 - 60:53)
maybe you have to win it some other way (60:51 - 60:54)
i mean i would imagine that it would say (60:53 - 60:58)
it's 50. like there's nothing (60:54 - 61:01)
particularly special about i mean (60:58 - 61:02)
if you're getting it as a capsule why (61:01 - 61:05)
not just keep it at the same price (61:02 - 61:07)
they've always made hidden ability (61:05 - 61:09)
pokemon like slightly (61:07 - 61:12)
like they always not like harder but (61:09 - 61:14)
they always added like one more hoop to (61:12 - 61:16)
jump through for hidden ability stuff (61:14 - 61:17)
yeah i feel like though if you're (61:16 - 61:20)
already just admitting hey we're gonna (61:17 - 61:22)
we're gonna just capsule this away that (61:20 - 61:23)
like if you wanna (61:22 - 61:25)
hit like if you wanted a hidden belly (61:23 - 61:27)
starter you have to you know (61:25 - 61:29)
sign up for pokemon bank sign up for (61:27 - 61:31)
pokemon home we're giving out a (61:29 - 61:33)
hidden ability starters and you gotta (61:31 - 61:35)
you know trade trade breed them and (61:33 - 61:36)
trade them and that's (61:35 - 61:38)
if you miss the event that's how you got (61:36 - 61:39)
to do it and it's like if you haven't (61:38 - 61:40)
been like (61:39 - 61:42)
two weeks you go to reddit and it's like (61:40 - 61:43)
i have (61:42 - 61:47)
5 000 hidden ability ones who wants one (61:43 - 61:48)
and you don't even care about their ivs (61:47 - 61:50)
because you're only looking for the (61:48 - 61:51)
hidden ability (61:50 - 61:54)
like within two weeks that gate is (61:51 - 61:56)
obliterated and (61:54 - 61:58)
forgotten what if you wanted uh you know (61:56 - 62:01)
hidden ability mewtwo you gotta (61:58 - 62:04)
buy pokemon red and blue on the virtual (62:01 - 62:05)
console and then play it and then catch (62:04 - 62:07)
it and then transfer it up (62:05 - 62:10)
hit what is hidden ability mewtwo it's (62:07 - 62:10)
just (62:10 - 62:12)
it just changes from pressure to (62:10 - 62:14)
generation or something (62:12 - 62:15)
no it's they're both bad it's pressure (62:14 - 62:18)
and unnerving abilities they're both bad (62:15 - 62:22)
oh but mega is (62:18 - 62:25)
insomnia oh that's not awful (62:22 - 62:27)
i mean it's not great it's better than (62:25 - 62:28)
pressure (62:27 - 62:32)
oh mega mewtwo x is steadfast (62:28 - 62:34)
what is steadfast increases the user's (62:32 - 62:36)
speed when flinched (62:34 - 62:40)
oh that's not that good (62:36 - 62:41)
none of these are good nobody wants to (62:40 - 62:43)
use the capsule on youtube (62:41 - 62:46)
your your example is garbage next i (62:43 - 62:48)
i just can't okay so i can't see them (62:46 - 62:50)
making the hidden ability like (62:48 - 62:51)
well maybe they can i don't know like a (62:50 - 62:53)
gimmick because the whole point of it is (62:51 - 62:56)
to lower the barrier for competitive (62:53 - 62:57)
and they already know their competitive (62:56 - 63:01)
people don't actually play the video (62:57 - 63:03)
game you're not wrong (63:01 - 63:05)
you're not wrong the amount of battles (63:03 - 63:06)
that i've had with people through (63:05 - 63:10)
ranked and it's just i i feel like the (63:06 - 63:11)
standard trainer card with the (63:10 - 63:13)
basic outfit because they haven't (63:11 - 63:15)
progressed past yeah (63:13 - 63:17)
whatever the first town is i feel like (63:15 - 63:19)
they could (63:17 - 63:20)
if they don't keep it the same which i (63:19 - 63:22)
think they should do then they're pro (63:20 - 63:23)
they're probably gonna double it which (63:22 - 63:24)
is just dumb (63:23 - 63:26)
because the people who really want that (63:24 - 63:27)
who are big competitor (63:26 - 63:31)
competitors that 100 is a not a barrier (63:27 - 63:34)
he is just yeah you're right like anyone (63:31 - 63:35)
who (63:34 - 63:38)
is battling non-stop (63:35 - 63:40)
even if it was 200 battle points like (63:38 - 63:42)
that's (63:40 - 63:43)
pretty easy for them to come by i mean (63:42 - 63:44)
you're getting like two battle points (63:43 - 63:45)
per battle (63:44 - 63:47)
you're getting 600 battle points after a (63:45 - 63:49)
season and there aren't that many (63:47 - 63:52)
good hidden ability like there are a (63:49 - 63:54)
handful (63:52 - 63:56)
that hidden ability is better but i (63:54 - 63:57)
don't think it's (63:56 - 63:59)
across the board for competitive that (63:57 - 64:00)
people will pick (63:59 - 64:03)
the hidden ability over one of their (64:00 - 64:05)
standard abilities depends on the team (64:03 - 64:05)
makeup (64:05 - 64:07)
that you're trying to make that's that's (64:05 - 64:09)
all it comes down to (64:07 - 64:10)
but at this point what makes a hidden (64:09 - 64:14)
ability to hit an ability (64:10 - 64:14)
dream world get to go to the dream world (64:15 - 64:19)
to get it yeah or you have to do raids (64:17 - 64:21)
it just seems weird that they've kind of (64:19 - 64:24)
protected this for so long (64:21 - 64:26)
and now they're just like well here's an (64:24 - 64:27)
item hey (64:26 - 64:29)
we don't know we don't know maybe you (64:27 - 64:31)
only get one per game (64:29 - 64:33)
yeah that's true i mean maybe you can't (64:31 - 64:34)
buy it but i think i still think that (64:33 - 64:36)
would be weird (64:34 - 64:38)
they've protected a lot of things for so (64:36 - 64:40)
long and have lowered the barrier shiny (64:38 - 64:41)
charms (64:40 - 64:44)
marked charm they have continually (64:41 - 64:46)
lowered superior for things that they (64:44 - 64:47)
protected (64:46 - 64:50)
move tutors breeding (64:47 - 64:53)
egg moves on to existing pokemon like (64:50 - 64:53)
they are (64:53 - 64:56)
blowing out all of the things that are (64:53 - 64:58)
just pointless barriers (64:56 - 65:00)
there is no reason for them to be there (64:58 - 65:01)
it they have (65:00 - 65:03)
seemed to have a track record where they (65:01 - 65:04)
always (65:03 - 65:07)
seem to reward players who buy their (65:04 - 65:08)
second version (65:07 - 65:11)
right so like in sun and moon there were (65:08 - 65:12)
no (65:11 - 65:14)
there were no move tutors and i think (65:12 - 65:15)
they made it like (65:14 - 65:17)
way easier to get like bottle caps or (65:15 - 65:19)
something and so they're rewarding (65:17 - 65:21)
they are rewarding people who are buying (65:19 - 65:23)
the dlc with these quality of life (65:21 - 65:25)
features which i guess is probably the (65:23 - 65:27)
the best thing you can offer uh because (65:25 - 65:28)
they have removed stuff before like (65:27 - 65:30)
again in ultrasound ultramoon they're (65:28 - 65:31)
like here's rotom boost you getting (65:30 - 65:33)
hatch eggs faster you can (65:31 - 65:34)
get more money you can get more (65:33 - 65:36)
experience by activating these boosts (65:34 - 65:39)
and now we remove all those for the next (65:36 - 65:40)
game (65:39 - 65:42)
yeah because it's a different region and (65:40 - 65:43)
the rotoms behave differently (65:42 - 65:46)
there's a row top i almost said a bad (65:43 - 65:47)
word (65:46 - 65:51)
rotom grass floating around on an island (65:47 - 65:52)
out there for no (65:51 - 65:55)
reason no stuck logical it is stuck (65:52 - 65:57)
it's stuck it can't mow across there and (65:55 - 65:59)
every time i catch it it comes back (65:57 - 66:04)
and i'm like it's like unlike oh (65:59 - 66:07)
did you know we somebody in our slack (66:04 - 66:10)
sent me a snap of warlord coming back oh (66:07 - 66:11)
alex (66:10 - 66:13)
yeah yeah alex alex got the weight lord (66:11 - 66:15)
back alex at the wheeler and i asked (66:13 - 66:17)
how did you get this i asked him the (66:15 - 66:18)
same question and he said (66:17 - 66:21)
i don't know i don't know the answer to (66:18 - 66:23)
everyone heartbreaking (66:21 - 66:26)
no one knows how to get it back mine is (66:23 - 66:27)
not back yet (66:26 - 66:30)
i've played every day since the dlc uh (66:27 - 66:31)
that's the problem you need to take a (66:30 - 66:31)
day off (66:31 - 66:35)
i i i have defeated honey i have crammed (66:31 - 66:38)
oh scammed i have done countless raids (66:35 - 66:41)
i have i have done everything and (66:38 - 66:43)
wailord is not back (66:41 - 66:45)
i don't know what it is all reggie's to (66:43 - 66:48)
the island (66:45 - 66:48)
maybe i need a party of six coil fish (66:48 - 66:53)
and i just spit in a circle (66:50 - 66:55)
okay some other things you can do maybe (66:53 - 66:57)
you're still not convinced on this dlc (66:55 - 67:01)
you give pokemon the giganta max factor (66:57 - 67:02)
this is another thing we were talking (67:01 - 67:04)
about remember before the dlc (67:02 - 67:06)
remember before sword shield came out we (67:04 - 67:08)
were like i was like i remember this (67:06 - 67:09)
specifically because i was like why (67:08 - 67:10)
would you (67:09 - 67:12)
if they're if they're restricting (67:10 - 67:14)
gigantomax pokemon to (67:12 - 67:17)
raids why would you catch a rookie d and (67:14 - 67:18)
evolve it into corvonite (67:17 - 67:20)
when you know it can't gigantomax and (67:18 - 67:23)
that's what they actually did they left (67:20 - 67:24)
like you could only get gigantic max (67:23 - 67:26)
corbinite and raids your rookie could (67:24 - 67:27)
not do that (67:26 - 67:30)
but in the dlc you'll get a chance to (67:27 - 67:31)
sample (67:30 - 67:34)
max soup during your adventure you can (67:31 - 67:35)
ladle out (67:34 - 67:38)
some to add the gigantic max form to any (67:35 - 67:40)
pokemon able to giganta max (67:38 - 67:42)
if you're attached to a particular (67:40 - 67:43)
pokemon perhaps your first partner (67:42 - 67:44)
pokemon (67:43 - 67:46)
an old favor transferred from home or a (67:44 - 67:47)
shiny pokemon (67:46 - 67:49)
you can use the max soup to get them uh (67:47 - 67:51)
uh to get them on an even playing field (67:49 - 67:53)
with the rarest pokemon in galler (67:51 - 67:55)
the only pokemon you have to assist (67:53 - 67:58)
further for this is the picky urshifu (67:55 - 68:00)
to recreate more max soup venture out (67:58 - 68:01)
into the courageous cavern brawler (68:00 - 68:04)
brawler's cave forest the focus or (68:01 - 68:06)
warm-up tunnel to find max mushrooms (68:04 - 68:08)
if you can't find max mushrooms in these (68:06 - 68:10)
locations try completing some max raid (68:08 - 68:10)
battles (68:10 - 68:14)
before looking again gotta lower that (68:10 - 68:14)
air (68:14 - 68:18)
lower that barrier of entry yep yep (68:14 - 68:20)
get it down so that everybody wants to (68:18 - 68:22)
play (68:20 - 68:24)

in certain stats which are represented (68:31 - 68:34)
by its base points (68:33 - 68:36)
if you would like it if you'd like your (68:34 - 68:37)
pokemon to have different (68:36 - 68:40)
stats it normally requires feeding them (68:37 - 68:42)
an extravagant (68:40 - 68:45)
amount of special berries to wipe slate (68:42 - 68:46)
extravagant yeah (68:45 - 68:49)

okay (71:14 - 71:17)
kevin says if you can have kevin from (71:14 - 71:18)
our slack community (71:17 - 71:21)
you could have one item from the pokemon (71:18 - 71:22)
from the pokey world (71:21 - 71:26)
irl what would you pick one item (71:22 - 71:28)
one item i guess like the things that (71:26 - 71:29)
you can (71:28 - 71:31)
give to your pokemon to hold for like a (71:29 - 71:32)
key item (71:31 - 71:34)

that's where my mind went first was (71:38 - 71:42)
rotom bike i mean it fits in my backpack (71:39 - 71:44)
and it's a bike and it's a rotom (71:42 - 71:45)

gasly and its evolutionary family were (77:17 - 77:22)
not not able to learn poison type moves (77:19 - 77:24)
by leveling up (77:22 - 77:28)
prior to let's go pikachu let's go eevee (77:24 - 77:31)
gastly has is tied with the lowest hp (77:28 - 77:32)
stat of all poison type pokemon with (77:31 - 77:33)
venipede (77:32 - 77:35)
the lowest defense stat of all poison (77:33 - 77:37)
type pokemon with weedle (77:35 - 77:40)
and the lowest defense (77:37 - 77:43)
stat of all ghost type pokemon with the (77:40 - 77:44)
dreepy (77:43 - 77:48)
gastly is a ball yep (77:44 - 77:52)
the big ball of gas ghastly is one of my (77:48 - 77:53)
favorite pokemon (77:52 - 77:55)
it's very cute although i mean that (77:53 - 77:57)
whole line i love them all really (77:55 - 78:00)
the shiny is so bad it was so hard on (77:57 - 78:01)
ghastly day to be like (78:00 - 78:04)
is this actually shiny i'm in the (78:01 - 78:06)
sunlight and i can't tell if the purple (78:04 - 78:06)
is (78:06 - 78:08)
slightly brighter they should have made (78:06 - 78:09)
it that whole (78:08 - 78:13)
shiny line white true i agree (78:09 - 78:14)
with red eyes we could have a whole (78:13 - 78:17)
podcast complaining about shiny colors (78:14 - 78:18)
we should do that remember when we were (78:17 - 78:20)
gonna do special podcasts for like (78:18 - 78:22)
quarterly et cetera et cetera put that (78:20 - 78:24)
on the schedule we're doing (78:22 - 78:27)
the shiny complaint cast oh boy (78:24 - 78:29)
we're going to do our top 10 worst (78:27 - 78:31)
chinese (78:29 - 78:33)
these are all going to be lime green i (78:31 - 78:34)
don't know (78:33 - 78:36)
i think uh yeah that's got a pretty (78:34 - 78:37)
terrible shiny (78:36 - 78:43)
stretch your mouth wow (78:37 - 78:47)
wow came for his baby you see (78:43 - 78:47)
you ready for this week's pokemon yeah (78:48 - 78:52)
yeah (78:50 - 78:54)
well the truth has been revealed it was (78:52 - 78:55)
a mistake (78:54 - 78:59)
to animate some pokemon in the overworld (78:55 - 79:01)
i recently had a pokemon as the first (78:59 - 79:03)
pokemon in my party (79:01 - 79:05)
holding a lucky egg so that it could (79:03 - 79:08)
soak up as much experience as possible (79:05 - 79:11)
and evolve into its final evolution (79:08 - 79:13)
it first evolves at level 30 and then (79:11 - 79:15)
does not reach its final evolution (79:13 - 79:18)
until it hits level 55. that is a long (79:15 - 79:20)
time and a lot of experience required (79:18 - 79:22)
for someone who doesn't use (79:20 - 79:26)
experience candies the problem is (79:22 - 79:28)
this middle evolution does not have any (79:26 - 79:29)
arms or legs (79:28 - 79:32)
so in the overworld it just kind of hops (79:29 - 79:34)
around (79:32 - 79:36)
even worse its bottom comes to a kind of (79:34 - 79:37)
point (79:36 - 79:39)
so it looks like a top balanced on its (79:37 - 79:42)
point that could tip over at any moment (79:39 - 79:45)
since its only animation is its eyes it (79:42 - 79:47)
just sort of looks angry and sad as it (79:45 - 79:48)
follows you (79:47 - 79:52)
hop hop hopping around the isle of armor (79:48 - 79:54)
even though this pokemon and its (79:52 - 79:55)
predecessor (79:54 - 79:58)
are named for forms of insect maturation (79:55 - 80:02)
it never has a bug type even so (79:58 - 80:03)
you can imagine what it would be like to (80:02 - 80:06)
have a metapod or cocuna (80:03 - 80:08)
hopping around to follow you on your (80:06 - 80:11)
journeys and you are on the right track (80:08 - 80:13)
i must admit i also made the error of (80:11 - 80:15)
not paying attention to this pokemon's (80:13 - 80:18)
typing as i had it in my party (80:15 - 80:20)
it definitely learns dark type moves (80:18 - 80:22)
prior to evolving into its final form (80:20 - 80:25)
including crunch even though it doesn't (80:22 - 80:26)
have a mouth (80:25 - 80:29)
but it does not receive a stab bonus for (80:26 - 80:30)
those (80:29 - 80:33)
hand in hand with that it loses stab on (80:30 - 80:35)
earthquake when it reaches its final (80:33 - 80:37)
evolution (80:35 - 80:39)
in the future i would argue that the (80:37 - 80:41)
animators should include a little wagon (80:39 - 80:43)
to pull pokemon similar to these around (80:41 - 80:46)
in until they have legs of their own (80:43 - 80:50)
there you go that's it that's it that's (80:46 - 80:52)
your pokemon of the week (80:50 - 80:54)
