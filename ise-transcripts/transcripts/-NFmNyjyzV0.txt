[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 444th episode of the pokemon podcast it's super effective i don't think there's a joke with 444 like there is with like 777 or 666. i'm your host sorry is there a joke you've misunderstood what the meaning of the word joke is i mean it's not a good joke if that's jokes memes references maybe is what i was looking for greg is here on the 444th episode of this four four four four the great number four four four as written in the thing meant how many trainers and sword and shield did their trainer ideas four four 16 million copies sold only 50 selected four four four yeah because four is a is a is not fortune number that's a bad number according to the internet 444 is the number of protection and encouragement it depends on what culture you're in i suppose sure will is here i [Laughter] please everyone buckle into your chairs i have two one small announcement one large announcement to make so prepare yourself here we go number one we received a complaint that there's not enough swearing on this program so forsooth there i have sworn oh sounds sound sounds how dusty odds bad kid and this is much more important who actually complained it's somebody in the slack was it a one star review that i took possibly one star we have a national crisis on our hands and i need anyone within the hearing sound of my voice to respond at your local supermarket there is currently a product called mountain dew major melon get this off the shelves and i don't mean by buying it it is horrible it's horrible i did buy a 12 pack i've drunk one and i'd like regret everything that in my life that has led up to this moment it is oh my there's no redeeming this awful excuse for a soda well yeah what what about the packaging made you think i want to buy this i uh i mean it looks the packaging looks like chaos so you just know it's gonna be chaos in your mouth i was hungry i normally get diet pepsi and i was like i need a week off from diet pepsi but i need a caffeinated soda i know mountain dew has the most caffeine of any soda but i just i don't like regular mountain dew flavor i was like let me try not only have they branded this major melon in regular sugar full you can get major melon zero sugar i was like this is a calling out to me i didn't i don't want dr pepper no and yet i mean dr pepper is the greatest drink so i don't know why he even said that no mr tube is the greatest drink i would have been better served to buy caffeine pills and crush them into my bubbly that would have been the wiser choice isn't there a caffeinated water yeah it's called water [Music] it's very bitter it's very bitter you can definitely taste the uh the after the caffeine whatever they add to it yeah that's the day after taste did you also purchase this mountain dew super melon wartime better believe i did greg i suspect you purchased this as well because you know that the packaging features a watermelon with an army helmet on it okay well one i had to look it up on the internet because i didn't believe you were actually talking about a real thing two i've never seen this i haven't just came out like uh two weeks ago well look at me early adopter spoiler major melon is a new pokemon in the next game and then i looked at the packaging and literally said nothing about this is selling me on this product you don't know skateboards okay this appeals to the skateboard oh is this your radical uh skateboarding nature the rebels yeah you know wild wild man watermelons with sharp teeth and tongue sticking out who came up with this steve your review of mountain dew major melon uh it's pretty mediocre uh i thought i mean i finished the 12-pack it's it's pretty disgusting it's i it's better oh here's what here's my review it's better than regular mountain dew but that's a love bar because i i think regular mountain dew is pretty pretty not great it's just it's just blind citrus like what's not great about mountain dew it's just literally slightly citrus and mostly caffeine this is bland watermelon i mean i'm not into that because i just bought my whole thing of watermelon bubbly which was on sale which we know i love i am into anything that has new on it though like if i walk down the candy aisle and then it says new on the packaging i'm in you got me so like pokemon snap why are you s such a fool why are you a marketer's absolute dream customer ideally i haven't been alive for uh many many years and you are like i in a world that there's no world of seven like you pretend you are the most sophisticated buyer and yet somebody just has slapped new on something and like i'm in and if they said new and rare you would buy 50 of them no i just like 100 a lie because if there was a package that said new lettuce no he'd still walk on by that yeah he's not touching no wet paper this is why i have an appreciation for burger king because they always have new things on their menu and i'm the guy that's like yeah i want to try that burger taco me up except you don't want to try like you want new things in your safe zone yeah 100 so small correct you don't explore out that you're like well it's new but also slightly in my safe zone i guess this is my major new year's resolution i'm going to try a slightly different flavor of mountain new and call it exploring a million percent correct it's like oh new sour patch kids i like sour patch kids i am definitely willing to try a slightly new version of this candy that i'm confident i like what could they even do to make sour patch kids new oh new flavors i don't know but i will hustle for a sour pass patch kid uh sponsorship on this show i mean it's possible like what do we need to do probably let them know we're interested i mean how many more flavors can they come up with for sour patch kids they could go even more sour yeah but i mean more sour isn't new it just improved which is also a phrase that that makes me question humanity new and improved which is it it can't be new if you've improved on something because that thing existed before and you're improving on it speaking of new [Music] we have uh information and a release date for a new pokemon snap which i will die on this hill that that's a bad name it is a terrible name uh but we will get to that in the later half of the show uh we need to get through our uh financials first oh here we go are we in the red or are we in the black i still don't know which one is good the red is good right incorrect incorrect this is why you don't do my taxes okay let's start off with the pokemon go news we have three different pokemon go things that all apply to money but in very different ways one is a lawsuit that the pokemon that niantic wins one is somebody being fined for playing pokemon go and the last is how much money pokemon go has made in 2020 there's a lot here if you don't play pokemon go i feel like the three articles here are still very worth listening to i think let's start with uh let's start with the arrest not an arrest it's a fine this is off bbc news this is from our attic channel uh who who's who in europe sent me this [Laughter] uh stuart of course it was stewart okay stewart stewart of course it was stewart covid 19 oh be off bbc covet 19 bed worth pokemon where where is bedworth i've never even heard of that it must be in the uk somewhere bedworth pokemon player fine for lockdown breach a man was fined for breaking lockdown rules after traveling 14 miles to play pokemon go he admitted to warwickshire the uk isn't a real place who what is warwickshire war it is a place where they make whisker wicker baskets and war in hills warwick shire this is like a place from the hobbit well yes as is the majority of the uk correct like that's what they do bedworth is north of coventry south of new england man admitted to work warwickshire police that he has driven from his home in bedworth to look for characters i think of pokemon in kennel worth he was fined 200 l with a line through it pounds okay i wasn't sure if if that was pounds or euros uh for quotes why would a euro be an l it's a weird country over there i mean it's multiple weird countries but we aren't we aren't going to get into that uh he was fined at 200 pounds what is that in us dollars that's probably like 250. okay 271 okay there you go he was fine for you greg knew instantly i was going to ask what the conversion was he was ready for what do you think i'm on the show for you he's fine we can't get to this article because europe is too weird yes okay next article 200 the truest thing ever said we can't get through this because europe is too big exactly have you seen eurovision oh no worse than that somebody like brought up crazy frog to me and i had to watch the crazy frog videos only europe could have produced crazy frog okay uh he was fined 270 pounds for quote contraiving the requirement to not leave or be outside the place they live without a reasonable excuse and quote uh this is the police spokeswoman said everyone has a part in play everyone has a part to play in ensuring they slow the spread of the virus we would like to remind people not they must not leave or be outside their home unless they have a reasonable excuse that was a uh that was a three sentence article that took us about 20 minutes to get through can you spell contriving to me because that's not a word in english uh contraving c-o-n-t-r-a-v-e-n-i-n-g contravening left out a whole syllable there it's okay i i i don't know what that word means either like it means like the going against going against the rules bbc could have just said that they did i mean it was hard because it was 50 50 that it was contravening or contriving yeah i was like i i had to get clarification okay i actually had to look up the article it's we made it through that one we did yeah i mean there's more to the article i got a whole bunch going on i think we're good with the article now yeah i mean it's nothing interesting in there except like they they actually quote a quote i call it commenter on reddit saying it's still exercise is exercise allowed in the uk lockdown right now because i i understood they were like they were like don't leave your house unless you're going to get some food or necessary supplies otherwise don't even walk out your front door buddy this is off polygon.com pokemon go creator aka niantic but you gotta you gotta you gotta you gotta get that seo in your in your article title pokemon go creator wins a 5 million dollar settlement from hack creators a cheap maker creating hacks for pokemon go ingress and harry potter wizards unite has agreed to a 5 million settlement following a lawsuit filed by creator niantic in 2019 the final judgment on this on the case which also granted niantic a permanent injunction was filed in california of course it was california district court on tuesday first reported by torrent freak the hacking group called global plus plus created infringing programs go plus plus potter plus plus ingress plus plus each uh of which were hacked versions of the relatively games using that niantic's game code using 96 code global plus plus apps were tweaked versions of niantic's games allowing players the ability to spoof their gps and use auto walk functions among other features as part of the lawsuit global plus plus faced charges including copyright infringement and violation of computer fraud and the abuse act the cheaters were founded to have accessed and copied niantic's map data and have been financially benefiting from its actions selling access to his programs which allowed players to cheat the system as part of the settlement go global plus plus has agreed to pay 5 million in damages it will also stop making these hacks selling using niantic's code and won't interfere with niantic's mobile games or servers again niantic has been been involved in a couple lawsuits over the past few years including a 2019 settlement involving pokemon go and angry home owners good old lake park milwaukee wisconsin it all comes back milwaukee lost that lawsuit by the way uh this year they did the year prior niantic settled a class action lawsuit and agreed to pay attendees of the chicago pokemon go festival their share of a 1.5 million dollar settlement you know i'm curious they said they they agree to the settlement for five million they're gonna stop selling and making these apps but i would assume that global plus plus probably is okay five million is probably a huge hit but they probably they probably made their money over the years well how many years have they been in business um i think they s started with ingress oh well yeah and people are just so comfortable cheating at pokemon go no surprise okay last article here at least regarding pokemon go and money and money this is off uh go nintendo.com a pokemon go pulls in one 1.92 billion in revenue for 2020. last time we heard about pokemon go's revenue was on december 15th of last year at the time we heard the game pulled in roughly 1.2 billion now final numbers have been crunched and the final total for 2020 is considerably higher according to super data niantic and pokemon company had a fantastic year pokemon ago pulled in 1.9 1.92 billion dollars in revenue when the year closed out it is unclear if the earlier reporting was a bit off but the game saw a huge boost the last couple weeks of 2020 either way all parties involved must be happy uh with how impressive the game continues to be that's a lot of money this immediately made me open up my robin hood so i can see how much is niantic trading for today why can't i find niantic does niantic not trade on the stock exchange i don't think so are they keeping that one point whatever billion to themselves and not sharing it with me i would assume they would just be sharing with a good old pokemon company first and foremost [Applause] hmm this is sus it says buy or sell niantic stock pre-ipo via an equity zen fund that doesn't make sense uh so the last thing i find was back in 2019 uh they have no plans to go for a public stock at that point so they're just yeah they're just at night [Applause] i had a few shares in nintendo and that stuff just dropped faster than my smile if you handed me a plate of lima beans i tell you it was no good fyi i don't like lima beans please don't ever offer me lima beans oh well i'm gonna put away my lime and bean casserole i was bringing you today thank you please that if you if you want to end our friendship with no discussion debate just a very brief transaction just hand me some there is no such food as lima bean casserole you make it up give it to me and it's over that's that that is the symbol of friendships end right there i'm looking at three different lima bean casseroles right now only the midwest could come up with such an atrocity uh incorrect this is from the south yeah the south is like the midwest of the south yes all right last bit of pokemon go news is actual pokemon go news uh okay so before we get to hoenn week which i'm sure greg is very excited about i'm very excited about i won't do the medal but i'm excited about it oh my goodness did you guys finish your sinnoh medal no not even close what do you mean not even close it's like catch four pokemon it is not catch four pokemon two of them were shadow yeah and i didn't get those balloons that's fair at all i had one i got one jessie and james like that doesn't help well no metal for you oh of course not i will say that i was surprised that my chim char catch was shiny oh nice congrats but let's see what i have left hold on i gotta pull up my my pokemon go so while you're doing that let me re-explain the only way that i play pokemon go if i have not like physically in presence with one of you two folks is exchanging pleasant gifts with my many many pokemon go playing friends and putting on cute little stickers mostly the torchic one because i'm extra lazy and that's the first one in the list but i i i do have a new issue they have added a sticker that looks as best as i can translate it looks like a very depressed fluffy white cloud lying on its side the alolan vulpix is the greatest sticker that vulpix has sharp features alertness this is no vulpix this is no no that's inappropriate i don't think i know what sticker you're talking about thank you for making me look at that it looks like a sad cat cloud it's something to this thing are you talking about the chubby alolan vulpix okay low picks is never choppy why i do like drunk pikachu as well which one's drunk pikachu it's the one next to the buy sticker the the yeah which you still have my buy is go on i have alright but the vulpix is look it's just wrong okay it's just it is certifiably can we change our eyes our messages icon to the vulpix if you do i will leave and you will never hear from me ever again so lima bean casserole and uh fluffy cute vulpix sticker these are the lines fluffy cute perfect sticker floating in the lime beam casserole yeah that's what we need somebody somebody art that up for will i mean this is like looking at the the stickers that greg sent it's like we've got some some winners here we've got a magical good one jump the magikarp jump fantastic the little thank you torchic which is the one that i use the most great beautiful well done the the eevee and pikachu drinking out of the ditto coffee cup that makes me think of chris every single time i see it but that vulpix is just ba it just it's just bad it's like oh good it's almost like it's almost like one of those like visual uh i don't remember what you call it but it's like if you tilt your phone sideways one way it looks like it could be like a it looks like it could be totoro with like swirly eyes and then if you look at it the other way if you tilt your phone the other way then it looks just like a cat with some whipped cream on its head maybe this is no vulpix no no trainers my cat disagrees we are excited to announce the hoenn uh that hoenn will be the next region in our celebration ends on countdown from tuesday january 19th through sunday january 24th trico torchic mudkip taylor loudrid nosepass aeron meditate rosalia carvana numel baltoy and more will be appearing in the wild if you're lucky you may encounter a shiny aeron which has been shiny for two years i mean you still have to be lucky to encounter it true very true the following pokemon will be hatching from 5k eggs skinny it's also pronounced nimble not pneumo thank you i think you're right skiddy poor fish lily amarith bagon beldum i can't believe greg has the 3ds voice perfected perfected enjoy event exclusive research that leads to stardust and leads to encounters like uh of wild pokemon such as trico torchic mudkip aaron plussel meinen and wilmer the following pokemon will be in raids trico torchic mudkip raltz aaron and bagon appearing in one star raids and then brellum mall while grumpig spinda which is actually exciting an absolute and three star raids uh i guess we don't know maybe data miners now i didn't look at the data mine for this i don't know if we don't know if this is like an exclusive spinda if there's all the spinda designs i think there's what eight of them uh it doesn't say valentine's day one coming back yeah it could be the the valentine's day one gives you a reason to do three stars though i don't think i'd be curious to ever look at the back end of niantic of like how many people did a groudon or how many people did uh like genesect and then like how many people did the three-star grumpy grade like 50. the same amount of picks four four four uh kyogre and groudon will be returning in five star raids uh complete the hoenn themed collection challenge during the events by collecting trico torchic mudkip nincada nose pass aeron plus ominous and bagon to receive three silver pin apps xp and an incense evolve metang the evolution of beldum during the event to get a metagross that knows the previous community move meteor mash event

remote raid passes will help you catch kyogre and groudon and it will be available in the game shop between tuesday to monday and then johto will be the following week ah nothing too exciting there i guess i mean i'm into it because it's owen but i will probably spend as much time doing this as it did the others which is not but they did announce the greatest community day ever very excited yeah well i'm glad you're excited the everybody should be excited it is the best community day and anybody who says differently has heard from me on twitter because i actively sought out people on twitter who are complaining about it and posting i think this is wonderful it's a great pokemon as a jerk test to see how they responded i would argue that it's a wonderful community day because i will have so much fun enjoying it with you greg yeah because i know you'll be happy and i will just be able to share in that moment i may even i may even do a test run of downtown minneapolis on this particular day and actually go out because i want to catch as many rosalia as i possibly can i might even buy extra storage i still i i saw somebody tweet that like this is the eighth community in a row or something that's like a repeat like of pokemon that are not new shinies i think or something of the sort because like machop's already been shiny oh i can't believe niantic is shorting us by not giving us a new shiny with this community day how dare they i am done with this game um but i guess my argument would be like one not everyone played two to three years ago two why would you why would you not save the good communities until after the pandemic is over this is a good community day well sure this is argument arguably the best community today they have done since the start of pokemon go i don't know even better than the one where they revealed miltan accidentally it wasn't an accident yeah i mean that thing's like i'm just playing into the whole oh okay yeah i think it's fine i mean there there's going to be a point where these events are going to repeat themselves uh and they're just repeating themselves during a time where it's hard to get outside so we're at the point where they're repeating things we were at the point two years ago when they repeated them before like they they do catch up days all the time they do catch up months all of december i'm not a big ketchup fan i prefer mustard or broccoli on ketchup day i just stay home i mean but two exclusive moves bullet seed and weather ball fire look at the great things plus the best shiny in the game uh so whether ball changes according to the weather that's on the field in the regular games so apparently they are giving it a set type in go so they're saying weatherball will always do fire and not change which is kind of weird since they introduced seasons that had weather forever but whatever look they're trying desperately to have all the balance as pos as possible for uh their gbl i am going to be taking many snapshots for my surprises during this game i don't know what the surprises are i'm sure it's just more rosalia in your picture but i'm into that i'm i'm sure it is this is the great i've never been more excite i was gonna i was out i had burned out in december trying to get to 40. i was done with this game and they brought me back in they know how to pull your trigger they know you finally did the right thing very clear niantic's listening the show we complained about three-star raids they were like spinned us here to save the day they they went on greg's journey of 40 and they were like we need to we need to win right back we need to pull him back in somehow get him make it possible that he have 20 shiny rosalia at the end of the day because i will i unlike most like i didn't i did them a chop one for two hours and i got 10. i will i will be out hoofing it trying to get that 200 catch for the thing i'm supposed to do all all six hours yeah man i'm getting everything i say that i won't last six hours i will not well i have 11 cans of mountain dew zero sugar major melon greg i know how you respond to caffeine so you're just gonna keep downing them i need to bring you your thing your your your christmas item yes i understand so i'll i'll swaps i will i will take some of major melon off your hands you'll be awake for days um steve could attest to by lack of drinking caffeine and sleeping he witnessed that miracle i have had three hours of sleep over the past two days and look at how awake i am right now off one can of mountain dew it's why is it not diet mountain dew they oh the words mountain dew zero sugar major melon do zero sugar major melon okay i'm into it they're not sponsoring the show we can't stop giving them air time maybe they're not sponsoring you yet oh yeah true but we do need to do our disclosure at some point all right let's take a break when we come back we're going to talk about pokemon 25th anniversary and pokemon snap and the fact that i still cannot figure out what dress katy perry is actually wearing it i cannot understand this picture cut the booty [Music] hey short and sweet this week if you are enjoying it's super

thank you for listening [Music] and we are back from our break it was uh it currently is i suppose as a recording but when this podcast comes out it was players cup three this weekend greg and will how'd you do i did great uh i went zero and zero oh my held my record strong i didn't give anything away it was great i thought this meant that i was just supposed to have coffee out of my play on player coffee cup that was my play as cup you're not wrong well how did you do steve i watched some of it not as good as i wanted i don't think i qualified unfortunately i ended at um 16 11. you don't think you qualified or you know you didn't qualify i know i was too qualified okay the the qualified people came to you and said no no they did they did not come to me and say you did not qualify but i ranked i did my 45 matches you can't do more only allowed i had a ranking of 16 11. um you start at 1 500. uh and then in order to qualify you probably need to be closer to 16.50 which i believe i was 1648 last time for players cup 2. uh and i was a thousandth in the world i think a thousand one thousand and eleventh place when i ended which means i mean there's still people participating now so that number could go up or could go down but since they're taking the top 800 players ish 256 from north america 256 from south america 128 oceana and then 256 europe pretty sure i'm out of that barrier unless for some reason 500 japanese players qualify or like top credit or placed high because japan can play but they can't qualify i was just gonna say what if there was a whole bunch of disqualifications because of cheating i don't think anyone cheated oh really not that i know of i i i won 27 matches i lost 18. uh i did the math if i would have if i would have not lost what's the right words if i would have won 29 and lost 16 so two losses mattered because normally you get like either lose anywhere between like 10 to 20 points per win or loss so if i if i if i got the lowest amount of points per win and those weren't losses i would have saved 20 points and gained 20 points which would have put me at 16.50 i thought my first day on stream was went really well and then i played saturday night and i should have probably taken more breaks in between matches well i know it's hard when you're so excited yeah it's it's like a nerve thing too and i i had the same nerve thing at like uh you know when we played in-game tournaments will where you're just like i just want the match to start instead of just like sitting there waiting i mean i enjoyed sitting there waiting quietly meditating on the pleasure that it is to be alive uh i had a good time i think i performed pretty okay i don't know i don't know i i guess i can't say i'm sure they'll do a player's cup four i don't see why they wouldn't seems to be oh i mean seems to they probably will yeah it seems to be doing really well for them you were a whole bucket of emotions watching when i was watching good emotions or bad emotions yes the okay yeah i mean if i know anything from history you just get too tied up in the whole thing when you when you were winning if you were you were at the highest highs and then i could always tell your silent rage when things are going bad because you get that you get that death look in your eyes that dead seriousness of and turn this around i i'm not a player that likes to do hard reads where it's like you know they have a really boom in front of me and and i have a blastoise out so like there's no reason for them to switch because they have like the obvious advantage there so my best move is to like hail storm into the into the rilaboom but i i could be like well i think they're going to switch to incineroar which would not take damage from the hail storm but also you don't bring an incineroar out in front of a gigantomax blastoise and i think that maybe you don't yeah you're not playing seven chess like really boom still survives the the hailstorm there were a lot of last night saturday night there were like every opponent i played just felt like they were just doing hard reads left and right and it it did get the they did get them the wins i i play more safe but in the best of one sometimes you just need one or two hard reads to yeah get the momentum because you don't have a way to it's not like i'm gonna rematch them right it's not like a best out of three where like it's like okay now i know that this pokemon has right a life orb where i didn't know that before so but overall you enjoyed your experience yeah yeah yeah i wish i had more time with the team uh i played um i played like a salamance porygon team on stream for like the last two months and that was like making changes to the pokemon it was pretty much the same team for two months uh and then last minute i decided to change the team so i only had will knows this where we we would change decks the night before a tournament that's the biggest mistake you can make buddy no i i i think changing the team was the correct decision i i like the team more i had fun playing the team but i switched to a blastoise dragopalt team like two days before and i only had two days of practice but i think i did pretty okay with it just bummed that i that i didn't qualify but that's okay they'll be next time one less thing to put on my linkedin profile and i've been checking i'll have you know all right let's start with the 25th anniversary stuff uh their 25 the 25th anniversary for pokemon takes place in february but they are kicking it off early here so this is their press release that came out just a couple days ago pokemon celebrates 25 years with a massive music program and activations across the franchise katy perry headlines p25 music a year of surprise music events and superstar collaborations with the pokemon company international officially launches the celebrations for the landmark 25th anniversary as an iconic video game and entertainment franchise beloved by million millions of fans all ages around the world pokemon is bringing people together ever since 1996. in 2021 pokemon continues that tradition by aligning with other universal unifying forces music headlined pop by pop icon katy perry the star studded program created in partnership with universal music group the world leader in music entertainment should be the world leader in scamming artists out of their money but okay dang accompanies fan focused activations by celebrating 25 years of pokemon across the franchise's portfolio of video games mobile apps animation merchandise and more helpful to help fans kick off the celebration a live action video uniquely highlighting moments of the brand's 25th history and a journey through the pokemons worlds many regions can be viewed at the beginning beginning today on the channel uh pokemon is working with some of the biggest names in music from rising stars to award-winning global superstars for his program titled p25 music pop icon katy perry was revealed today as the premier collaborator in the massive year-long music campaign so is this like instead of us getting like a year of mythical or like a year of legendary we're just gonna get like one new song a month no i don't think that this is an instead this is just one of the many features somebody will be providing us it's a it's a puzzle so you have to decode the code in every song but so you can actually put that into your switch and then you will unlock something but if you don't listen and buy the song and then figure out the code you won't get it no one buys songs anymore excuse they just have their apple music or spotify or if what's that other one i believe there's one nick burgess out there that has received cash for me at least twice in the past five years i buy from artists because streaming services don't really pay them and if i really like it i will pay them the money they deserve for the product that they made so i will buy it even though i may listen to it on spotify i will buy their music from them the most direct way that i can because if i'm really enjoying it they should get paid and they should get paid fairly this is the basis of a lawsuit happening right now against you music artists get like a dollar from like a 10 like they don't this is the whole point of umg like what is umg universal music group oh whatever you're i i don't know what you're talking about with that thing the whole issue when it boils down to dollars to doughnuts streaming they get like a tenth of a penny per stream versus if you buy the music then they get like at least 10 of the cost yeah they get like ten pennies instead of one penny ten pennies is still better than they are penny exactly that's how math works ten times more and i'm giving them that on top of the money from streaming the only the only people who wins here are umg universal music group yes okay katy perry has a quote here pokemon has been a constant in my life from playing the original video games on my game boy to trading pokemon tcg cards at lunch to the adventures of catching pokemon on the streets in pokemon go i've even visited the pokemon cafe in japan while on tour it was an honor to be chosen to help celebrate a franchise that has given me much joy in the last 25 years and to be able to watch it all evolve in the ways it has provided a kind of electric joy for kids in my life and around the world said katy perry so one thing i'm happy to kind of get a clarification on is i was concerned that like katy perry was the only musical component of this whole thing and to find out that there will be other artists featured i mean i like i do enjoy the occasional katy perry although you know problematic in certain areas um but yeah just to know that other artists will also be featured that that makes me happy i'm not in the music scene like you two are yeah you don't like music but yeah i i hate everything that brings joy i mean he he bought that lord album seven years ago or eight years ago yeah yeah i saw it on his record player that one time i i do have a record player i do have i do have records of music one being are you a vinyl hipster uh at one point in my life look i wore a chain wallet at one point in my life i have a record player i shopped at uh urbana every once in a while i forget how basic you are and then you come rushing back into the conversation earlier not describe like paint that picture clearly i mean i try to think that i've made better choices with my friends in my life and you're here to prove me wrong i literally had the memory this morning i was like walking i had just gone to target i was walking to the elevator from my car and literally the thought came through my head of i remember when steve used to only wear supras but it's like that was the only shoes that he would buy was supras as so as a music person yes as as an owner of uh katy perry teenage dream on vinyl okay this is this is actually my point if they're saying katy perry is headlining that means no artist bigger than katy perry can be on whatever they're doing this year uh that's open to interpretation they may be saying headlining just because she's the first featured artist okay while other ones will be coming later but like she's the headliner because she's first not because she's greatest and most powerful okay headlining general means they are the main act but that that doesn't mean like that somebody that you would consider more famous than her won't also be included is that she's the main focus of of what they're doing uh and she may have had a big role in selecting the artists that were a part of this collaboration but if it's if it's umg universal music group if remember we are talking international not universal no but it says there it says pokemon is working with umg specifically so does that mean the other artists have to be also signed a umg like katy perry is probably most likely yes yeah so we're not going to see any bts unless they do something like you can sign agreements to out but probably not because they don't want to pay that money but you know there could be a taylor swift a lady gaga on there i'm assuming those are umg yeah a mariah carey could be on there ooh do you think they were for christmas is pokemon do you think they bring back m2m was m2m on uh umg i've never even heard of this group what m2m did the mewtwo movie song well weren't they norwegian were they uh yeah i think they were from somewhere in europe oh they were emi and uh what was the other one emi and atlantic so i don't think so no colin palmer vice president of marketing at pokemon company international says in katy perry we see a kindred spirit to pokemon whose world is bright fun and unlit uh uplifting katy perry is a wonderful ambassador to help us celebrate 25 years of pokemon and we can't wait for music fans everywhere to experience the collaborations we have planned and then lj guu rez general manager of umg according to just as a breaking breaking news i'm looking at wikipedia and i do not know how i accurate this but list of universal music group artists under b is bts south korea well well well interesting i know bts has signed a big hit i believe is their label brain also butthole surfaces are there so i'm looking for their song they haven't been good since 1993. this could be their comeback frankie ghosa hollywood is on this list i'm waiting for that comeback this could be the greatest pokemon album ever but also remember like universal is a is like that the high level i'm i'm gesturing with my hand which you cannot see universals at the top they have many subdivision labels under them so the label that bts is on could be a subdivision of universal music group that's the group part we're honored to celebrate the 25th anniversary of pokemon and a significant cultural impact this beloved franchise continues to have around the world working together we have developed dynamic year-round programming to involve artists across umg's labels because what a better way to create a global celebration than through the power of music details about katy perry's participation additional artist surprise and more about the p25 music will be announced throughout the year alright that's it we're done with the music part i still don't

forward to more merchandise uh from licensees including jazwares scholastic mattel funko power a and the wand company we do know that the wand company is making those hundred dollar fancy pokeball things [Music] did you mean scholastic yeah that's what i said i just uh i was pondering that for a long time i'm like stuttered a bit you know uh jazz wears is what used to be wicked cool toys oh uh wait jazwares bought them out and merged with them mattel has made pokemon stuff before scholastic has made pokemon stuff before funko obviously power a makes those pikachu switch controllers and

destination for official high quality pokemon merchandise to the us and canada to kick off the celebrations on pokemon centers fans will be able to pre-order the 25th limited edition skateboard by industry craftsman bear walker starting on january 19th that's the day after this program comes out also commentary on high quality now we're not getting that skateboard uh the high quality pokemon center merchandise i bought the two athletic pikachu tank tops that are available from pokemon center i have worn them both to the gym nobody commented on either one but they were very comfortable i'm gonna buy that the dark one is much more comfortable you think togepi lover would like them oh absolutely oh absolutely more if there was togepi on them but how long do you think it's been how long have we heard since we've heard from togepi lover too long too long i'm concerned for their health uh more celebrations along the way the details are just a glimpse of what the world can expect in 2021 with the 25th anniversary uh activations plan for animation video games mobile games including go and masters e x uh and more big announcements from the franchise fans will have a year full of new journeys ahead maybe we'll talk about this next week but there is somebody broke their nda for pokemon unite there are there's oh yeah there is cinderease in a you know pirate costume there is machamp wearing subspenders there's [Music] nothing surprising for a moba cause like in like dota and like league of legends you buy like hats and stuff like that's very common in those games you buy skins yeah don't buy articles of clothing skins get your wins isn't donut just hats though i thought dota was hats i don't know anything about dota except my friends that play it i don't pay that much attention but i know in league it's all about the skins are you sure you're not thinking of fortnite oh no fortnite is for sure skins i think dota's hats right i'm going to search on the internet is dota hats that is kind of yes okay so now this does make sense because in dota you don't have like specific champions that you own there's a drafting system at the beginning of the competition so then you might want to put your hat on the particular one that you draft that makes sense but wait no no no i've seen skins because that glowing blue ball you can skin it as a companion cube from portal so i think you can only see that though no it was on the world championships oh because i thought dota also had voice packs where oh definitely yes you can hear yes you can i have heard the rick and morty voice pack more times than i've ever wanted to in my entire life but if you watch the whole uh the documentary about the world championships where it was like the one guy was friends with the other guy and they had a team and then the one guy betrayed his friend and formed a new team but didn't invite his friend and then his friend created his own team and then they like recruited all these people who were no like unknowns and then came back and won the whole thing and then like won it for a couple of years that they had a skin on the little blue glowy ball so there you go there's your answer i kind of want to get the skateboard will dude get in line because it's to be there's going to be a rush on those skateboards so well the skateboards have all sold out within like an hour of being posted but if i was an hour buddy within five minutes of being posted if i was to get if i was to get any skateboard i feel like getting the 25th anniversary skateboard is the one to get i that would be fantastic but i don't feel like i mean maybe i'll roll the dice unfortunately it's a tuesday so that's going to be hard to do but i you know i will say when i shipped my toxicity board from south carolina to minnesota that i that when they asked like how much do you want to insure this package for and i looked i was like how much is this silly toxicity board going for on ebay it was 350 dollars wow i buy two skateboards i flip one of them the flipping pays for the initial skateboard if you do that i will buy myself a can of lima beans and end it all right here you will know it's over by me posting that horrible quote alolan vulpix quote picture as our group chat uh i don't think i can budget a 250 i'm assuming it's 250. oh they're 150. are they 150. yeah 150 is a little easier to swallow than 250. it's a hundred dollars just you to swallow okay they also announced new pokemon snap we have a release date sooner than i thought i honestly thought this was going to be like a um june july september game i nothing comes out in august no uh but we're getting it in april yeah i'm excited it looks good it looks really really good i have my initial uh a thoughts and impression on youtube uh normally i stream like announcements like that but i had thursday off so i just recorded a like eight minute video of my thoughts of seeing the trailer for the first time that's on youtube dot com slash pkmncas but overall uh it looks good uh i have some ups and downs here but i guess we'll get through the press release in new pokemon snap players will take on the role of uh a buddy pokemon photographer and work in the lentil region uh with expert professor mir and his assistant rita on an ecological survey to photograph pokemon thriving in nature in a new trailer today additional footage and details unveiled for the new pokemon snap with the april 30th launch date new pokemon snap present presents a fun twist on the pokemon adventure with enchanting gameplay that lets players see some of their favorite pokemon in a different light says nick chavez from nintendo of america senior vice president of sales and marketing quote this new game is a fun addition to a strong lineup of pokemon titles on the nintendo switch we can't wait to see everyone's pictures for the new pokemon snap launches on april 30th uh wild pokemon are all around and have adapted to thrive in the various natural expansions of the lentil region and they have may be seen living in groups patrolling their territory wandering serenely on their own or even playing with other pokemon species with a careful eye and a photographer's keen sense of adventure you'll be able to spot pokemon lurking in all sorts of places including secluded hideaways and sometimes swooping down from the sky players will be able to interact with pokemon by throwing by throwing fluff fruit a tasty fruit found across the region to catch their attention or watch them eat you can even use this fruit to help draw out pokemon in a variety of situations to see how they react these surp serpentabulous opportunities these opportunities present a special challenge and serendipitous opportunities that's a word seems like a european word has been for a long time i mean must much of english did originate in europe so yeah these serpendipidus opportunities present and catching them on the camera will be a perfect moment that you may gain a higher score professor muir will evaluate scores pokemon photography is evaluated based on subjects poses how large they appear how directly they are in the camera and if they will fall into frame as players take more photos to fulfill their research they may see pokemon look and behave in entirely new ways pokemon will have two players will have to take many photos to use the highest scores to fill out their photo decks the untouched depths of the lentil region may sound daunting at first but don't worry explorers will hop into the neo1 an auto driving vehicle that will steer them across various paths on each island so they can free up time to focus on snapping the perfect shots throughout your missions you may even get to see pokemon looking and behaving differently than before these special moments are memories to savior so if you're lucky you'll always have your trusty camera on hand to caption capture those pokemon some pokemon and vegetation that players will discover will also have a special glow these strange occurrences are only found in the lentil region and are known as illumina the alumina phenomenon jump into the trusty neo one to uncover the mystery behind the illuminati phenomenon and that's uh that's it that's the press release oh okay there was a lot there but uh i'm assuming you both saw the trailer and i'm assuming you both have thoughts greg you can go on this one i mean i'm excited for it i mean there was nothing i don't think they showed anything apart from the giant light up meganium that felt a lot different than the regular snap like the old timey snap um which is fine i i don't think they gave a whole lot away uh but i liked everything that i saw i'm excited for it so my only issue with i can't say my only issue my issue with pokemon snap is when i played the first one on my nintendo 64 i was not a kid right it just really did not appeal to me at all i i got very little pleasure out of it and so there's like no nostalgia tick for me on this particular game and then just the gameplay i'll have to see it to believe it i'm just i i can't get excited if it's going to be a reflection of what the past pokemon snap was i think there's a lot of nostalgia around pokemon snap people remember it being like for other people yes sure i mean i have nostalgia about i mean i enjoyed the game when i played it but again my you know i was my nostalgia of it like i knew it was not you know it wasn't like this super great game that i played all the time but i mean it was just at the time it was another pokemon product that i wanted to play and i could see that the game was just a very basic loader like you're gonna go along this path and take pictures and then slowly unlock things and it was a very short game and i don't really expect much more out of this game right like it didn't show anything more out of this particular game it was just like okay you're gonna be on the exact same track taking pictures and you'll like you'll have to repeat places because you'll once again like the first one get new items to make them do new things and you still will never understand what criteria it actually uses to give you a good picture oh it's just randomized i'm sure calculations will be better this time the only thing i feel a little uneasy about is is it given how small the first one felt felt like it was pushing the price limit this is 60 dollars that feels a lot for how limited the very first pokemon snap was so i'm very curious how many pokemon are in it how many areas are in it yeah exactly i mean it's a tough sell yeah i mean i'll still buy it i still think i can get enjoyment out of it i i am really questioning the cost that's sort of my my major like is this is it going to look pretty enough to be worth 60 and i i don't have that sense yet i i'm leaning towards no so i i have a lot of thoughts uh they did say on there's newpokemonsnap.pokemon.com is a website yeah they do say there are over 200 pokemon which means uh like 207 right yeah like if there was 250 pokemon they would say over 250 pokemon if there was a even if there was 220 i feel like they would probably say there's over 220 pokemon but it's probably like 205 204 pokemon uh that in itself yeah explore beaches jungles deserts and more as you photograph over 200 pokemon and investigate the mysterious illumina phenomenon in the new pokemons now i think that number is low yep the first game had 63 pokemon it was supposed to have 64 pokemon the pokemon that was cut last minute was ekans uh because i can't remember exactly why it was cut but it was supposed to be nintendo 64. there if you if you are too young to remember nintendo 64 games every game had this ongoing thing of like we have to have a 64 reference somewhere in our game for a pokemon snap it was like well it's 64 pokemon that moving around the environment but they had to cut atkins last minute so it was only 63 pokemon uh which at the time that's like over one-third of the pokedex and in this case i guess it's like one-fourth of the pokedex yeah just about just about but i 200 pokemon is a good amount don't get me wrong yeah going with what i agree with greg about is a 60 dollar game for 200 pokemon this is this is yeah this is like the the theme of pokemon now is just like how how many pokemon can we cut out and still sell them again like can we get the can we get them to pay 60 for a five pokemon game let's see if we can do it those suckers will buy anything quit now frauds yeah quit now frauds like that i think we argued about this a year ago i think i think uh will didn't believe this was going to be a 60 game and i pretty much said on this podcast the pokemon tax will make it a sixty dollar game because they can get away with sounds like me yeah it sounds like yes um so he's like do you remember original pokemon snap that wasn't a sixty dollar game i think original pokemon snap was the full price of a 16 nintendo 64 game which was yes absolutely forty nine dollars i think right 50 bucks was nintendo 64 games around that very expensive okay so this is this sounds like more than i think they were were they 40 or were they 50 i would say they were 40. they might have been 40. yeah you're right greg they might have been 40 because i think gamecube was when they bumped it to 50. yeah and then we they kept it at 50 and then switch they jumped it to 60. because they made a big deal about that yep again maybe maybe some adults don't remember their pokemon snap days as well as i do i've played pokemon snap probably once a year and i think that game does out of all the nintendo 64 games i do think pokemon snap holds up i do think i i do i want to be very clear that i like pokemon snap i think it's i think it is an enjoyable afternoon once a year to sit down with a friend or a nephew or your significant other and to play pokemon snap together i think for what that game is it captures that but but beyond that uh i don't think pokemon snap was the game that was worth the full price back then and i think they knew that and the reason i'm the reason they knew that is because they specifically partnered with best or with blockbuster they put the kiosk in the store because they knew that people would rent this game yep and that this game was perfect for rentals because when you owned it you realized all the flaws yeah absolutely and uh no lie i actually rented this game from a video store not blockbuster but i did i do it as a rental i think i returned it two days later i'm pretty sure i bought it i probably still have it somewhere in this house and so my worry all this time with pokemon snap was they knew back then that this game would be an amazing rental game and for and and it was it was a real like it was the thing that like if my parents were like we gotta run we gotta go to the grocery store and i'm like oh but we're gonna probably stop at blockbuster i was like oh gosh please take me i will suffer through two hours of grocery shopping to get like five minutes of playing the pokemon snap kiosk and maybe convincing you to spend the five dollars so we can rent this for 48 hours um it was the perfect rental game because it wasn't in my opinion a a game that should have been full price compared to other games so now you have a new pokemon snap at full price which is i guess three times the amount of content but 64 like once you played through if you own pokemon snap you you were probably one of those players that could beat the entire game start to finish in like two hours yeah and so if this is if this ends up being six to eight hours maybe i guess and i'm not the type of person that's like i need x amount of time from a video game to make it worth it like i played gone home that's like a that's like an hour-long game it's like 20 bucks loved it played firewatch that's like a four-hour game 20 bucks loved it you know uncharted one you get through that story like 12 hours 60 bucks loved it so i don't have a problem paying 60 for a short experience if that experience is good pokemon snap looks good but let's not kid ourselves that the original game they knew that it was short and they and it existed in a time where renting was a thing to do and it was a perfect rental game yeah which is my worry here there is a very unique and special shiny pokemon that can only be obtained by completing your pokey's pokemon's photo decks is that worth a sixty dollars what if it is another opportunity to get a shiny mew i mean maybe that knows a special move maybe or has a special hidden ability inability shiny mu if you're if well mythical pokemon don't have hidden abilities yet they will now they will now i don't think they need to attach a pokemon to this like they did ranger or coliseum because they have nostalgia working for them this is 25th anniversary all bets are off the table it's time to go wild they probably would have already said there there are a few people that are like ever since this game got announced there are a few people being like i hope there are shiny pokemon in it it doesn't matter the amount of people that would weigh 60 on whether this game has shinies or not like that is that is such a significantly small portion of the audience and i even think if you already thought 60 was too much and they were like well you can maybe see a shiny pokemon i still maybe don't think you pull the trigger there's probably one person listening being like i'm only buying this game if they have shiny pokemon yeah but for like the general audience like ma or dad walking into the store the the the the main reason they're buying it is because it says pokemon uh and if you're an adult like like the three of us are you're either buying it or not whether or not they have shiny pokemon i think shiny pokemon would be okay i think it would add some replay just value to the game you just see the shiny pokemon it's you don't get to catch them they don't go into your pokemon home sure sure but it still adds some replay value but i think that's what the illuminati thing is um the illuminati's got a whole other bent on to talk about how the illuminati have infiltrated the pokemon universe i'm way more into this game now that they're illuminati in it uh it says lentil pokemon and their habits to uncover the truth about the illumina phenomenon so i i i think that like that is the special thing you're looking for you probably want to read i don't think i could be wrong but i don't think every time you go through the forest level you're going to see a shining glowing meganium i think that that is probably a rare occurrence and that is the reason you would replay through those levels oh yeah so do they need illuminati aluminum illumina do they need alumina and do they need shiny probably not because they're probably doing the same thing which is i have a chance to get a quote-unquote rarer picture going through i don't know if 300 pokemon like if they said 300 pokemon i think i would feel better about the 60 if they said 400 pokemon i think i'd feel really good yeah if they said 810 pokemon i'd feel great there there would be no way i mean i just can't help i just it's just so hard for me i'm excited for this game i'm going to play it on day one i'll spend the 60 that's not a problem i just can't help think how does this a game exist in 2021 and not disappoint people when the original game existed in a very specific time zone i mean there's a few like they're definitely relying on nostalgia zone like they're definitely relying on people being like i love this game because it reminds it's it's the game that i wanted back then because it looks so much prettier it's coming at a time quite frankly when a nice relaxing game sounds really good like i think it's it's approaching that sort of animal crossing just a day-to-day thing the thing is the initial buy-in is there because people are looking at it without thinking am i going to get a lot out of this game like you could play animal cross people are still playing animal crossing which also cost sixty dollars which also got six dollars i think i think animal crossing is worth the 60 oh it definitely is i think compared if you do a comparison and say like baseline pokemon's new pokemon snap is a 60 game that would mean that animal crossing is actually a 240 game because it gives you a reason to return every day every month it is constantly evolving it's engaging it's changing it's like like look at the huge difference like you can change your world in animal crossing in pokemon snap you can't change anything you just walk through and take photos i hate taking photos it doesn't it does look like they're there there's a couple things that it does look like there's a day and night cycle yeah we don't know if that's a real time but i didn't even do that in the regular pokemon game so i'm now i'm impressed okay sorry chill has a day a night cycle so i get carried away here when you're when you're done with the game when you're done with the game it doesn't lock it does look like the poke the photo decks sorry i almost said pokedex the photo decks can tell the difference between genders so you might we don't know yet but you might be able to take a picture of a male apom and be like i haven't found the female apom yet so wait so is that what they mean by more than 200 pokemon is it's actually 200 pokemon and then variant gender i mean they did show him maybe the second time you go through the desert area you see a male one instead of a female one the thing is is like here's our met if it was a 30 game it would be an absolute home run at like no questions buying it playing the heck out of it as we get further away from that point i feel less i feel less likely that i'm going to actually buy this game like almost every pokemon game for me is i pretty much just buy it period and i'm getting to the point where i have a lot of things competing for my time correct and something that promises the same level and potentially the same shortness of gameplay that the first one did is not my go-to like i will most likely watch people play it and say think do am i getting like if you're streaming it will i get as much enjoyment out of watching you stream it as me playing it i need somebody to travel back in time 25 years and ask them to just like shift it one year forward or one year back and let's not have this in the same year that a new monster hunter game is coming out on switch please i think this is going to be a game where people love it for a week maybe a month and then they're done with it yeah exactly and i think that's fine my worry is just that there is not enough there and maybe if they have uh like online leaderboards where you can see no there will be no online i know there won't i know there won't there won't be any online leaderboards but it would like they did say here on the website there will be a way to share your photos yeah you upload it to twitter you like everything you hit the little photo button on your switch controller exactly yes look this game will be worth 60 dollars to me if there's a level where there's a pyramid with a glowing eye at the top of it and if you can whisper george washington was replaced by a doppelganger and it opens up like a whole new reality then yes the illuminati have won and i'm in i just hope that there's something a little bit more and i think there will be there's usually in pokemon games there's always one or two things they they like hold back it looks great i think it will be fun but 60 bucks 200 pokemon and really really banking on nostalgia is is worrisome not a deal-breaker just worrisome and and i saw a couple people being like again this is just an expectation thing we've had this with sword and shield we have this with other pokemon games but people like well they could just do dlc they could they they could what if they just made a good game to begin with like like yeah they could do dlc but who's to say you're even gonna enjoy what they put out initially uh i just i i can't even think about dlc for a game that isn't even out that i haven't even played it's just why are we thinking so far ahead it's just the same frustration i get when and i've told this story before but the day let's go pikachu let's go eevee came out we're playing it on twitch twitch.tv slash pkm and cast we're having a good time we're catching the weedles we're battling the brocks we're going through mount moon and the not even exaggerating the day let's go pikachu let's go eevee came out over a dozen people came into my twitch chat and said when do you think the next pokemon game is coming out buddy i'm playing it right now it came out six hours ago it wasn't it wasn't enough it wasn't it was diet coke it wasn't it wasn't as people just get so ahead of themselves with with everything in life but specifically with like pokemon and video games it's like what if there's dlc for pokemon snap yeah maybe what if pokemon snap what if we just waiting to see if pokemon snap's a good game first because if you don't like it your dlc argument's going out the window what if there's dlc for mario kart and all my friends have already stopped playing hmm it looks really good i believe the people making pokemon snap were the same people who made pokken tournament right i believe that is the case and the art will be good there you go uh developed by bandai namco yeah which is the same as pokemon they make katamari damasi um maybe you can there's a unlock version where you mess it over roll up all the pokemon this will be featured on uh my podcast sweet they did say over 200 pokemon and in the uh on the website they show three different vivian forms will yeah all the people who have and have not collected multiple video vivion forms i am on the i have not collected anything more than what was handed to me so are they counting like the 18 forms of vivian part of the 200 oh yeah probably worried yeah i i mean i am 50 50 on the fence whether i'm buying the game i'm excited for it in in that i really want to watch people play it and if it looks really good then i might want to play it myself um because i actually think this is good content to watch and not what was it it was good content on the nintendo 64 to watch but that was before twitch that was when you go to blockbuster you rent the game for five dollars you go through the beach level it takes you what like five minutes to go through it maybe four minutes and then you get your pictures and then you hand the controller to your your somebody else in the house they do the same level they get two pictures better than you and you now have the option of like do i want to go back through beach because i want my photos to win or do i want to go to cave like that's how you play pokemon snap yeah and that's how you got the longevity out of it for the 48 hours you rented it before you sent it back to blockbuster and then when you rent it from blockbuster two weeks later you're like well it's been two weeks i guess i start off with beach uh and then i go to cave and then i go to river and then i go to uh what was the valley i think was the valley valley i think at the end of the day i will get my 60 out of it i'll play it for a week it'll be good and then i will probably end up with pokemon quest which was i played it for a week i absolutely adored it for the week but i haven't played quest since man i could never defeat the final boss in that game i didn't get very far in quest but also quest was a much cheaper game yeah it was free and if you really liked it you give it 20 bucks yeah i sort of feel like maybe that's the route they should have taken with this i mean maybe they'll put on a demo and i'll play the demo and see if i like it yeah we i mean we can't tell until we touch it yeah i don't know it's very i i it it looks pretty i disagree with a bunch of people who are saying that it doesn't i just don't having played the other game i don't know that there's the same people complaining about the graphics are probably the same people playing minecraft what do they care about graphics they're building eight bit blocks with look nobody's mine minecraft anymore we play roblox now oh yeah oh yeah with the times dude i mean the 25th anniversary image is amazing uh yeah it's good i really like that i like the fact that they pulled the like the one thing that was introduced whether you liked it or not and each poor unova is there in their musical outfits just sitting out there the thing that nobody hey i enjoyed putting little clothing outfits on my pokemon we're going a little long today so we're gonna jump to pokemon of the week road oh good gracious do i even have the software open to run pokemon of the week i do but i didn't oh dagnabbit all right last week's pokemon number one people complain about my accent which i really have little control over people don't complain about it just no i literally got a complaint from someone um related to the what one reference was the pokemon that's related to unova's throw who would that be greg salk soak that's right and then i made a reference to when i uh did the whole thing about um dagnabbit lullaby evolves into where my brain is lost lullaby in into mandibuzz and i had the whole reference to the to the word what is the word mandible buzzer buzzard is buzzard is used to refer to vultures in this country and walks sock is a fighting type hawk is a type of bird and then i also brought up the wrestling team enzo amore and big cass because they're known for saying soft s-a-w-f-t now here we go fighting type a hawk and wrestling what what pokemon does that make you think of it [Music] knocked owl oh what a clever little knock show it's halucha for lucha that's right and i don't want to name names but somebody in my twitter dm said i can't think of a hawk pokemon and i'm like are you serious i hope it's not the person whose favorite pokemon is halucha when i was no no but it's somebody who's a big fan of wrestling when i was doing uh players cup three there was a team i fought that had a zatu oh right i saw that one and i was so worried because i didn't know what zatu did i mean they had a pretty standard team like they had like pokemon i recognized and i was like okay this pokemon does this this pokemon does this this pokemon does this and then they just had a zatu and i was like dude it really wrecks fl fighting types i was like do i do i attack the zatu first do i leave i don't know what the zatu does uh but uh the zatu didn't get to do anything unfortunately i i think i i faked out the zatu and then i attacked its partner and then i attacked the zatu next but the that's the that's the thing with competitive sometimes you're just like oh i've never fought a zod too i don't know i don't even know it's moveset i mean i'm sure it sets up tailwind if zatu has tailwind yeah i don't know [Music] you mean you never did find out what it was supposed to yeah i never i never found out what it's supposed to do uh it's like it's like those uh rogue decks and tcg will where they they pull out a card and you're like can i read that because uh yeah no one's ever actually played that card against me so can i uh can i please read what that card does uh zatu does learn tailwind i feel like we've had halucha be pokemon of the week yes i'm running out of ideas folks maybe next week can be zatu no i've already written next week's and it is definitely not zatu unfortunately it's knocked out what a clever little knock towel all right shuffle icon greg and then let's move forward uh shovel icon for hallucia if i remember correct me back to the page it's good i mean i think it's i think it's one of those it's really good it even had a shiny shuffle icon it's hard it's hard to do a bad hoalucha that is like a general it's missing one thing but generally otherwise it's a pretty good pokemon all around yeah i mean apart from the fact that it always looks mad i like both i like i like the lighter color of the shuffle over the trosie the trojan one's sort of more flat so i like the fact that the shuffle also has a shiny like it's a good shuffle icon it's also a good shiny it is a good shiny it's it's a vibrant change and i'm into that all right this week's pokemon of the week i i thought i was going easy on folks i don't know maybe i have gone easy maybe this is going to be a tough one i i don't live in your head i can't tell you that you're going to respond to this here we go think
