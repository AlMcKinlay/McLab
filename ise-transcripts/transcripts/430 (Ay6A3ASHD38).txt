sbj here and uh no (0:38 - 0:42)
will and greg i'm actually recording (0:41 - 0:44)
this on a thursday evening (0:42 - 0:46)
earlier this week we had an interview (0:44 - 0:48)
with pokey jungle (0:46 - 0:49)
uh which you could probably tell by the (0:48 - 0:51)
title of the episode um so that's what (0:49 - 0:53)
this episode is going to be (0:51 - 0:54)
we have a 40 minute interview with poke (0:53 - 0:56)
jungle that will come after the break we (0:54 - 0:57)
have just a (0:56 - 0:59)
tiny bit of news here um that i'm just (0:57 - 1:01)
going to cover by myself i didn't want (0:59 - 1:02)
to drag (1:01 - 1:04)
will and greg into a thursday night (1:02 - 1:06)
recording when they have lives and (1:04 - 1:08)
it's it's it's nothing really it's not (1:06 - 1:09)
the most (1:08 - 1:11)
major news in the world so uh just (1:09 - 1:12)
tackle this news real quick (1:11 - 1:15)
we'll go to a break it'll be poke jungle (1:12 - 1:17)
uh talking about his experience as well (1:15 - 1:19)
living in japan running the website (1:17 - 1:21)
rumors all that stuff and then that will (1:19 - 1:22)
be uh (1:21 - 1:23)
and then that will be the episode for (1:22 - 1:25)
today so no question of the week (1:23 - 1:28)
no pokemon of the week no will no greg (1:25 - 1:30)
you just gotta put up with me for like (1:28 - 1:30)
the next like (1:30 - 1:33)
well i'm in the interview part two well (1:30 - 1:34)
you gotta put up with me for like 10 (1:33 - 1:35)
minutes of news (1:34 - 1:38)
and then that's it so uh probably like (1:35 - 1:39)
less than an hour (1:38 - 1:41)
episode i'm assuming this is going to be (1:39 - 1:43)
but last week's episode was two hours (1:41 - 1:43)
and (1:43 - 1:45)
next week's episode will be the final (1:43 - 1:47)
episode before crown tundra (1:45 - 1:50)
so we'll probably have a lot to cover (1:47 - 1:51)
before then and then obviously a lot to (1:50 - 1:52)
cover (1:51 - 1:55)
afterwards uh so let's get into the news (1:52 - 1:56)
real quick (1:55 - 1:58)
[Music] (1:56 - 2:00)
first bit of news here is charmander (1:58 - 2:02)
community day we did not talk about this (2:00 - 2:02)
last week (2:02 - 2:05)
but uh just a reminder it is saturday (2:02 - 2:06)
october 17th (2:05 - 2:10)
from 11 to 5. obviously shiny charmander (2:06 - 2:12)
uh when if you evolve charmeleon into (2:10 - 2:14)
charizard you will know the move (2:12 - 2:17)
dragon breath which is the fast type (2:14 - 2:17)
move so there (2:17 - 2:20)
is no blast burn this time around i (2:17 - 2:22)
believe niantic has uh confirmed (2:20 - 2:26)
that blast burn is only with the uh (2:22 - 2:29)
pay to win uh tms that you can only buy (2:26 - 2:31)
like once a month (2:29 - 2:32)
speaking of that there will be a (2:31 - 2:35)
one-time special purchase for uh (2:32 - 2:40)
12 dollars and 80 cents aka 1280 pokey (2:35 - 2:42)
coins featuring the elite charge (2:40 - 2:43)
tm it will also come with three (2:42 - 2:45)
incubators three star pieces and 30 (2:43 - 2:46)
ultra balls (2:45 - 2:50)
i still i'll bang this drum every week i (2:46 - 2:51)
still think this is a ripoff i still (2:50 - 2:53)
think this is very pay to win i think (2:51 - 2:54)
this is very damaging out of a lot of (2:53 - 2:56)
things that are wrong with pokemon go (2:54 - 2:57)
this is definitely (2:56 - 3:00)
one of them for sure but uh we don't (2:57 - 3:01)
need to (3:00 - 3:04)
dwell on that uh there will be (3:01 - 3:06)
event timed at research and field (3:04 - 3:07)
research to earn (3:06 - 3:10)
mega charizard candy energy i don't know (3:07 - 3:11)
what they're calling it the things that (3:10 - 3:13)
mega evolve your charizard (3:11 - 3:15)
and then for one dollar they are doing (3:13 - 3:17)
an october community exclusive (3:15 - 3:20)
special research story which will also (3:17 - 3:20)
include (3:20 - 3:24)
charizard mega energy the bonus let's (3:20 - 3:25)
say you don't care about (3:24 - 3:27)
chinese charmander maybe you already (3:25 - 3:29)
have a million of them the bonus is (3:27 - 3:30)
gonna be three times catch (3:29 - 3:33)
stardust and your incense will last for (3:30 - 3:34)
three hours (3:33 - 3:36)
instead of the one hour we did talk (3:34 - 3:38)
about last week how (3:36 - 3:42)
niantic nerfed the incense prior to (3:38 - 3:45)
covid and incense was 30 minutes and if (3:42 - 3:46)
you were not moving (3:45 - 3:49)
you would get a spawn once every five (3:46 - 3:50)
minutes (3:49 - 3:54)
when kovid started uh they doubled it (3:50 - 3:55)
so uh they doubled the time so instead (3:54 - 3:57)
of lasting 30 minutes to last an hour we (3:55 - 3:58)
all know this (3:57 - 4:02)
but you would get a spawn about every 60 (3:58 - 4:02)
seconds (4:02 - 4:05)
which is 60 an hour and recently (4:02 - 4:08)
what we talked about last week niantic (4:05 - 4:09)
changed (4:08 - 4:11)
the incense but didn't really specify or (4:09 - 4:12)
explain the web (4:11 - 4:14)
their blog post they just said it went (4:12 - 4:15)
back to normal but it will still last an (4:14 - 4:17)
hour we talked about this (4:15 - 4:19)
they changed it from every 60 seconds if (4:17 - 4:20)
you were moving (4:19 - 4:23)
to about every 90 seconds give or take (4:20 - 4:25)
um depending on how fast you're catching (4:23 - 4:26)
just some basic math because i don't (4:25 - 4:28)
think we did the math last week but (4:26 - 4:31)
instead of getting 60 spawns an hour in (4:28 - 4:32)
your house you would get (4:31 - 4:34)
40 spawns an hour which is still good (4:32 - 4:35)
better than the (4:34 - 4:38)
uh five six spawns you would have gotten (4:35 - 4:40)
uh with the initial incense and let's (4:38 - 4:41)
just say they doubled that that would (4:40 - 4:42)
have been 12. so (4:41 - 4:45)
better than what it was before but not (4:42 - 4:46)
as good as it was (4:45 - 4:49)
timing on that has not particularly been (4:46 - 4:50)
good (4:49 - 4:53)
but here we are next big news here this (4:50 - 4:54)
is actually (4:53 - 4:55)
really exciting for me i'm actually (4:54 - 4:57)
really really excited for this uh it's (4:55 - 4:59)
it's hard to explain here on a podcast (4:57 - 5:01)
but this is pokemon.com (4:59 - 5:05)
they're announcing a premium collection (5:01 - 5:08)
ultra premium collection ultra (5:05 - 5:10)
premium collection for zashian and (5:08 - 5:12)
zamazenta this is for the pokemon tcg (5:10 - 5:15)
if you like black and gold which totally (5:12 - 5:17)
my aesthetics (5:15 - 5:19)
aesthetics that's a word i'm probably (5:17 - 5:20)
putting an extra letter in there (5:19 - 5:23)
uh if you like black and gold this looks (5:20 - 5:24)
awesome (5:23 - 5:27)
it is a tcg thing it's coming with one (5:24 - 5:29)
special gold version of zashian fee this (5:27 - 5:29)
is (5:29 - 5:31)
they've done this before they i think (5:29 - 5:33)
the first like major big gold cards that (5:31 - 5:34)
people freaked out about was (5:33 - 5:36)
resham and zekrom back in black and (5:34 - 5:38)
white but a special gold version of (5:36 - 5:40)
zashian v (5:38 - 5:42)
a special gold version of z zama zenta v (5:40 - 5:43)
you get (5:42 - 5:45)
two sets of metal damage counters so (5:43 - 5:47)
that's 12 dice total (5:45 - 5:49)
uh metal which is awesome not the (5:47 - 5:51)
plastic that comes in the elite trainer (5:49 - 5:53)
boxes you get two metal coins featuring (5:51 - 5:54)
zamasunta and zashian (5:53 - 5:57)
you will get two sets of card sleeves (5:54 - 5:59)
one featuring (5:57 - 6:00)
one featuring zashian one featuring (5:59 - 6:04)
zamasunta you get 130 sleeves total (6:00 - 6:06)
you will get quote a set of richly (6:04 - 6:07)
richly (6:06 - 6:10)
designed metal condition markers so that (6:07 - 6:12)
would be your um (6:10 - 6:15)
poison or your burn you will get (6:12 - 6:19)
16 booster packs for the sword and (6:15 - 6:19)
shield (6:19 - 6:22)
series so uh they're not very clear what (6:19 - 6:23)
this is but they do say (6:22 - 6:25)
from the sword and shield series so this (6:23 - 6:26)
could be bass short (6:25 - 6:29)
sword and shield short and shield bass (6:26 - 6:31)
sword and shield rebel clash (6:29 - 6:34)
darkness ablaze am i missing a set (6:31 - 6:37)
i think those are the three sets uh i (6:34 - 6:40)
guess maybe i doubt champion's path (6:37 - 6:43)
um and then vivid voltage will be vivid (6:40 - 6:45)
voltage will be out by then (6:43 - 6:47)
i believe so i'm not sure if it will (6:45 - 6:48)
include vivid voltage it doesn't (6:47 - 6:50)
specifically say (6:48 - 6:53)
but this does launch november 20th (6:50 - 6:55)
it will come with a player's guide of (6:53 - 6:56)
course the rule book the (6:55 - 6:59)
tcg online it will be available wherever (6:56 - 7:00)
cards are sold (6:59 - 7:03)
there is no price on this (7:00 - 7:07)
16 booster packs times four dollars (7:03 - 7:11)
and i'll just say 50 cents is 72 bucks (7:07 - 7:14)
and of course you always pay the pokemon (7:11 - 7:15)
tax on the (7:14 - 7:18)
special packet especially because like (7:15 - 7:20)
you're always like an elite trainer box (7:18 - 7:22)
you're you're paying like an extra (7:20 - 7:23)
what is it like six or eight dollars (7:22 - 7:26)
just kind of for everything around it (7:23 - 7:28)
um so i'm expecting this will be 99 (7:26 - 7:29)
that's gonna be my guess it's probably (7:28 - 7:31)
gonna be a hundred bucks (7:29 - 7:34)
16 booster packs two sets of metal dice (7:31 - 7:36)
two sets of metal coins (7:34 - 7:39)
one special zamasu one special zashian (7:36 - 7:40)
um if you want to see it it's on (7:39 - 7:42)
pokemon.com it's literally on their (7:40 - 7:43)
homepage (7:42 - 7:44)
it should still be there should be easy (7:43 - 7:46)
find it looks awesome though it looks (7:44 - 7:47)
very very cool (7:46 - 7:48)
uh and if you're a collector and you (7:47 - 7:50)
like boxes i guess (7:48 - 7:53)
there's a box for you uh this was sent (7:50 - 7:54)
in by andrew our (7:53 - 7:56)
uh resident japanese correspondent in (7:54 - 7:57)
our addict (7:56 - 8:01)
channel in slack cannon made (7:57 - 8:05)
a camera a point and shoot camera for (8:01 - 8:08)
kids uh with pikachu on it this is also (8:05 - 8:12)
hard to describe so imagine like those (8:08 - 8:14)
gosh this is gonna show my age here (8:12 - 8:16)
where's (8:14 - 8:17)
when when there's no will or greg in the (8:16 - 8:19)
show i'm now the oldest (8:17 - 8:22)
and now i am ultimate boomer uh (8:19 - 8:26)
i'm too old okay so when i was a kid (8:22 - 8:27)
the thing that was the coolest was like (8:26 - 8:29)
those point-and-shoot cameras you would (8:27 - 8:32)
get at walgreens or or cvs (8:29 - 8:33)
i don't even know how much they were (8:32 - 8:35)
they were like eight dollars (8:33 - 8:38)
but then you you took you could take (8:35 - 8:40)
like 60 photos (8:38 - 8:41)
and then you would take it back to (8:40 - 8:42)
walgreens and they would develop the (8:41 - 8:43)
film and stuff (8:42 - 8:46)
so it kind of looks like that a point (8:43 - 8:48)
and shoot camera (8:46 - 8:53)
except it has like a built-in carabiner (8:48 - 8:56)
so you can just latch it onto your (8:53 - 8:57)
backpack or your (8:56 - 9:00)
uh belt loop really quickly which is (8:57 - 9:01)
cool (9:00 - 9:03)
it doesn't look like there's a flash on (9:01 - 9:05)
it but that's fine because (9:03 - 9:08)
flash doesn't work ever the (9:05 - 9:11)
front of the camera if you remember the (9:08 - 9:12)
like pikachu (9:11 - 9:14)
3ds and it was like all yellow and then (9:12 - 9:16)
it was just pikachu's (9:14 - 9:19)
eyes mouth and cheeks it it has that (9:16 - 9:20)
aesthetic (9:19 - 9:22)
why is this the word of the episode it (9:20 - 9:24)
has that look going for it (9:22 - 9:27)
but they will be selling separate what (9:24 - 9:28)
are called (9:27 - 9:32)
jackets so you can change out the front (9:28 - 9:34)
with different um they have like yamper (9:32 - 9:35)
and pikachu they have (9:34 - 9:38)
a raichu pikachu pichu they have a bunch (9:35 - 9:39)
of pikachu that peachy with the glaring (9:38 - 9:41)
starters pikachu with the (9:39 - 9:44)
um cantonian starter canton starters (9:41 - 9:47)
the back has a couple features uh so it (9:44 - 9:48)
looks like it has a camera it looks like (9:47 - 9:50)
it has a video feature (9:48 - 9:53)
and then it looks like it has uh so the (9:50 - 9:54)
camera feature (9:53 - 9:56)
the video feature it looks like it can (9:54 - 9:58)
take a picture and apply pikachu's (9:56 - 9:59)
cheeks (9:58 - 10:02)
to the subject so if you're taking like (9:59 - 10:03)
a picture of like (10:02 - 10:05)
somebody's face it puts pikachu's cheeks (10:03 - 10:06)
on them (10:05 - 10:08)
i think that's what it means sorry the (10:06 - 10:10)
website's in japanese (10:08 - 10:12)
uh i'm doing my best here with google (10:10 - 10:14)
translate and the other thing is it (10:12 - 10:15)
looks like there is built in either (10:14 - 10:17)
wi-fi or bluetooth to transfer the (10:15 - 10:18)
pictures to your phone directly (10:17 - 10:20)
which is probably the coolest part (10:18 - 10:21)
because who's developing (10:20 - 10:23)
anything so it was available for (10:21 - 10:26)
purchase on pokemon center dot (10:23 - 10:28)
pokemon center hyphen online.com which (10:26 - 10:30)
is the japanese pokemon center (10:28 - 10:33)
it was uh 000 yen (10:30 - 10:37)
which comes to about 175 (10:33 - 10:40)
dollars usd so uh not (10:37 - 10:44)
a cheap gift for your kids (10:40 - 10:47)
but it does apparently shoot (10:44 - 10:51)
video and shoot and has (10:47 - 10:53)
bluetooth i guess there was an exclusive (10:51 - 10:55)
bonus or if you did order it off pokemon (10:53 - 10:56)
center (10:55 - 10:59)
you got a little pikachu tail charm that (10:56 - 11:00)
you could attach to your camera or your (10:59 - 11:02)
phone you also got a pokeball lanyard (11:00 - 11:05)
you also got an exclusive face paint (11:02 - 11:07)
faceplate for it (11:05 - 11:10)
they were also selling it on store dot (11:07 - 11:11)
canon (11:10 - 11:14)
dot jp but they have not (11:11 - 11:18)
released pre-orders for that yet (11:14 - 11:19)
but the pre-orders for the japanese (11:18 - 11:22)
pokemon center was completely (11:19 - 11:24)
sold out oh they also have like the (11:22 - 11:25)
canon is offering (11:24 - 11:29)
bundles so they're offering um uh (11:25 - 11:32)
i'm really trying to milk this milk give (11:29 - 11:33)
you guys a little bit of a locker (11:32 - 11:34)
episode of milking this (11:33 - 11:36)
so they offer a leisure bundle which is (11:34 - 11:39)
cool uh so that comes with a (11:36 - 11:44)
that weird youtuber octopus tripod stand (11:39 - 11:47)
a memory card a canon water bottle (11:44 - 11:49)
and then it looks like some stickers and (11:47 - 11:51)
then there's a family bundle which comes (11:49 - 11:54)
with two of these pikachu cameras (11:51 - 11:57)
and then it comes with a uh two sd cards (11:54 - 11:58)
the leisure bundle also comes with the (11:57 - 11:59)
sd card (11:58 - 12:02)
and then it comes with a printer so you (11:59 - 12:04)
can print these at home (12:02 - 12:06)
like one of those um not like a like not (12:04 - 12:08)
like a canon well (12:06 - 12:10)
not like a big printer like a photo (12:08 - 12:12)
printer one of the little ones that just (12:10 - 12:12)
print (12:12 - 12:16)
kind of cool probably (12:12 - 12:19)
a novelty thing i'm sure i (12:16 - 12:21)
i can't imagine these cameras are taking (12:19 - 12:23)
better pictures than like somebody's (12:21 - 12:25)
like pixel phone or somebody's iphone or (12:23 - 12:26)
something or like (12:25 - 12:29)
almost every android phone that has (12:26 - 12:30)
probably come out in the last couple (12:29 - 12:30)
years (12:30 - 12:32)
i don't know too much about sensors and (12:30 - 12:35)
the japanese website doesn't really (12:32 - 12:37)
go like it doesn't really go into depth (12:35 - 12:38)
of what kind of (12:37 - 12:39)
sensors they are that i can that i can (12:38 - 12:42)
see but it's cool (12:39 - 12:44)
it's it's something and that's that's (12:42 - 12:46)
pretty much all the news (12:44 - 12:49)
so camera new tcg thing brand new that (12:46 - 12:51)
was actually announced this week (12:49 - 12:53)
and then the pokemon go stuff coming up (12:51 - 12:55)

super excited for that (16:57 - 17:01)
yeah it's very very soon yeah and you (16:58 - 17:02)
know what luckily (17:01 - 17:04)
shadowlands was pushed back for world of (17:02 - 17:06)
warcraft so i don't even have to worry (17:04 - 17:07)
about like (17:06 - 17:10)
the overall crunch pokemon usually (17:07 - 17:12)
always comes out like (17:10 - 17:14)
where another big game comes out and (17:12 - 17:15)
there's always like conflict there (17:14 - 17:18)
unless you're only a pokemon fan (17:15 - 17:20)
that can be the worst so for those that (17:18 - 17:21)
don't know (17:20 - 17:24)
who you are which i find hard to believe (17:21 - 17:24)
but (17:24 - 17:26)
uh just maybe a little bit about (17:24 - 17:28)
yourself what you do um (17:26 - 17:31)
well i started poke jungle back in (17:28 - 17:34)
about 2004 and i've been running it kind (17:31 - 17:35)
of since (17:34 - 17:38)
um i did take like a year off before (17:35 - 17:41)
gen 5 just for like mental health (17:38 - 17:42)
reasons but like (17:41 - 17:45)
i'm just a pokemon super fan and part of (17:42 - 17:47)
the way that i (17:45 - 17:49)
love to embrace the series is just to (17:47 - 17:50)
cover (17:49 - 17:53)
the news um and (17:50 - 17:56)
yeah i've i've lived in japan for a (17:53 - 17:58)
total of nine years (17:56 - 18:00)
which is really fun and now i'm back in (17:58 - 18:01)
the us (18:00 - 18:03)
so it's kind of it's kind of different (18:01 - 18:04)
you know because when you're in japan (18:03 - 18:06)
you get to enjoy (18:04 - 18:08)
pokemon in such a different way um just (18:06 - 18:09)
because it's (18:08 - 18:12)
it's i would say a bigger thing over (18:09 - 18:13)
there you know like i would just be able (18:12 - 18:15)
to like play pokemon go (18:13 - 18:17)
uh raids you know there would be like (18:15 - 18:19)
groups of people just standing on the (18:17 - 18:20)
streets and (18:19 - 18:21)
i found that's a little bit different (18:20 - 18:23)
you know like in america pre-pandemic (18:21 - 18:24)
even (18:23 - 18:28)
but yeah i i i guess that's who i am all (18:24 - 18:28)
right (18:28 - 18:30)
i i do want to talk about the japan (18:28 - 18:32)
stuff i know that's a big part of your (18:30 - 18:35)
your history but before we get there (18:32 - 18:36)
what was your uh (18:35 - 18:38)
first experience with with pokemon was (18:36 - 18:40)
it the red and blue was it the gold and (18:38 - 18:42)
silver was it the anime the tcg (18:40 - 18:45)
so actually i started playing with (18:42 - 18:46)
pokemon crystal (18:45 - 18:49)
and i like when i grew up my parents (18:46 - 18:53)
were not into like video games they were (18:49 - 18:54)
very limited you know like (18:53 - 18:56)
my screen time was very limited um and (18:54 - 18:58)
they didn't want extra (18:56 - 19:02)
like screens brought into the house um (18:58 - 19:05)
so i yeah i didn't have a game boy and i (19:02 - 19:08)
finally got a game boy advance this was (19:05 - 19:10)
before gen 3 launched (19:08 - 19:11)
but at that time i just had a game boy (19:10 - 19:14)
advance and i bought pokemon crystal (19:11 - 19:16)
and that was when i first got to play it (19:14 - 19:17)
but obviously like (19:16 - 19:20)
i did get to play through friends who (19:17 - 19:21)
had (19:20 - 19:23)
red and blue so sure i was there since (19:21 - 19:24)
the beginning (19:23 - 19:27)
i just like i didn't get to be like (19:24 - 19:28)
really hands-on (19:27 - 19:31)
um with the games until crystal (19:28 - 19:32)
okay and that's kind of what started (19:31 - 19:34)
everything was there i always i was (19:32 - 19:35)
asked to stall (19:34 - 19:37)
all the all the people we interviewed (19:35 - 19:38)
but was there ever like a fallout with (19:37 - 19:40)
pokemon where you're like oh i can't (19:38 - 19:42)
i gotta step away it's too nerdy i'm (19:40 - 19:44)
getting made fun of it's not the cool (19:42 - 19:46)
thing (19:44 - 19:49)
um i you know like i'm (19:46 - 19:51)
i'm a nerd and i just i just kind of (19:49 - 19:52)
embrace that (19:51 - 19:55)
and i live with it and i'm i (19:52 - 19:57)
i okay i don't really talk about pokemon (19:55 - 20:00)
in like offline very much (19:57 - 20:04)
um but i kind of just own you know like (20:00 - 20:07)
my my love of the series and (20:04 - 20:09)
i you know sadly in elementary school (20:07 - 20:10)
this is kind of embarrassing to admit (20:09 - 20:13)
but like i was like the fifth grader who (20:10 - 20:15)
still had like pokemon cards on the bus (20:13 - 20:17)
and you know like the kids who'd want to (20:15 - 20:18)
trade me were (20:17 - 20:21)
in like third or fourth grade i knew so (20:18 - 20:23)
i was kind of the odd man out you know (20:21 - 20:25)
like still still with the series (20:23 - 20:27)
so what you're saying is you got the (20:25 - 20:29)
sick deals because it's very easy to rip (20:27 - 20:31)
off third graders (20:29 - 20:33)
okay i'm not you know what this is tape (20:31 - 20:34)
so i'm not admitting to anything (20:33 - 20:39)
right now 2004 you decided to (20:34 - 20:43)
launch pokejungle yep and uh i (20:39 - 20:46)
believe there was a lot of i felt like a (20:43 - 20:47)
lot of website that was like the the (20:46 - 20:49)
2000s things right (20:47 - 20:52)
uh the very 2000 thing of um cereby (20:49 - 20:53)
bulbapedia (20:52 - 20:56)
pokebeach gosh i can't even remember the (20:53 - 20:57)
other ones (20:56 - 20:59)
uh but those are probably the three that (20:57 - 21:01)
are still around (20:59 - 21:02)
i'm assuming you knew those sites (21:01 - 21:04)
existed was there was there anything of (21:02 - 21:04)
like (21:04 - 21:06)
i can do this better or i can do this (21:04 - 21:08)
differently or what was what was the (21:06 - 21:09)
mindset initially (21:08 - 21:11)
you know i don't know if i ever thought (21:09 - 21:13)
that i could do it better um but i just (21:11 - 21:15)
knew that i wanted to do it and for some (21:13 - 21:16)
reason (21:15 - 21:19)
i just love the concept of like (21:16 - 21:22)
web development and everything um that (21:19 - 21:23)
goes along with it (21:22 - 21:25)
so that was you know what this is super (21:23 - 21:26)
funny but like (21:25 - 21:29)
my real foray into web (21:26 - 21:31)
website building actually started with (21:29 - 21:33)
neopets because i wanted to make a (21:31 - 21:34)
website for my like (21:33 - 21:37)
little neopets guild um and at that time (21:34 - 21:38)
like i didn't know how to make layouts (21:37 - 21:41)
or anything so this was just a geocities (21:38 - 21:43)
website and and basically it was just (21:41 - 21:44)
like (21:43 - 21:45)
centered content because i didn't know (21:44 - 21:47)
how to like make a table and like (21:45 - 21:50)
have sidebars or a banner so it's just (21:47 - 21:51)
literally like (21:50 - 21:53)
centered text down a page you know like (21:51 - 21:55)
with a eye blinding (21:53 - 21:57)
you know magenta color background or (21:55 - 21:58)
something (21:57 - 22:01)
um and there was a website i think it's (21:58 - 22:02)
still there it's like (22:01 - 22:04)
lisa explains it all or something it's (22:02 - 22:05)
like a very (22:04 - 22:08)
female oriented html development for (22:05 - 22:09)
like kids (22:08 - 22:12)
kind of website from the early 2000s um (22:09 - 22:13)
and (22:12 - 22:14)
i would just go on there and read a (22:13 - 22:16)
bunch of stuff and i (22:14 - 22:19)
loved pokemon so i didn't do anything (22:16 - 22:21)
further with neopets but (22:19 - 22:23)
that was kind of my launching point into (22:21 - 22:24)
like oh hey like (22:23 - 22:26)
cerabi looks so cool i i want to make up (22:24 - 22:28)
my own website so (22:26 - 22:30)
um cerebri was definitely a big (22:28 - 22:32)
inspiration i guess (22:30 - 22:33)
of why i wanted to do it but there were (22:32 - 22:35)
a ton there were just so many (22:33 - 22:38)
um websites back then like there was (22:35 - 22:39)
pokemon safari (22:38 - 22:43)
um pokey cave i think um it was just (22:39 - 22:45)
it was like the thing to do was to make (22:43 - 22:47)
pokemon websites at that point in time (22:45 - 22:48)
so (22:47 - 22:49)
well if you wanted to see what cereb (22:48 - 22:51)
looked like back then just go to serbia (22:49 - 22:52)
right now (22:51 - 22:56)
because it hasn't changed (22:52 - 22:56)
uh i'm no comment (22:57 - 23:01)
like we all know that joe does cerebe (23:01 - 23:06)
pretty much full time and bulbapedia is (23:04 - 23:06)
like (23:06 - 23:10)
7 million people updating uh is there is (23:06 - 23:11)
there a team (23:10 - 23:13)
over at pokejungle is it just you is it (23:11 - 23:15)
a full-time thing is it a hobby thing (23:13 - 23:16)
um because you do get news out pretty (23:15 - 23:19)
quickly i do get news out pretty quickly (23:16 - 23:22)
um but right now i would say (23:19 - 23:25)
it's pretty small um i've always had (23:22 - 23:27)
like a group of a quarter (23:25 - 23:32)
of people that helped me um for instance (23:27 - 23:35)
our designer is sam um and he's been (23:32 - 23:38)
just creating some amazing things for us (23:35 - 23:39)
i think for (23:38 - 23:42)
probably five years now um and (23:39 - 23:44)
that's been great because i suck at (23:42 - 23:47)
graphics uh that's that's definitely one (23:44 - 23:48)
of my weaknesses (23:47 - 23:51)
so yeah it's awesome well that you know (23:48 - 23:52)
what if it does (23:51 - 23:54)
and thank you uh that's because of him (23:52 - 23:55)
so (23:54 - 23:58)
um he's been a huge help for me we also (23:55 - 23:59)
have had like many team members (23:58 - 24:01)
um that just you know try to write and (23:59 - 24:03)
cover the news especially in (24:01 - 24:07)
earlier generations um right now it is (24:03 - 24:08)
pretty much just (24:07 - 24:12)
me and then we also have um (24:08 - 24:14)
nick who's been writing some origin of (24:12 - 24:16)
species articles for us (24:14 - 24:19)
but yeah they're you know and (24:16 - 24:21)
i don't know like there's too many (24:19 - 24:23)
people think right now but there are a (24:21 - 24:24)
lot of people have put a lot of hard (24:23 - 24:26)
work and effort into (24:24 - 24:29)
um helping me and making the site better (24:26 - 24:30)
yeah that's awesome and you got verified (24:29 - 24:32)
on twitter so that that's (24:30 - 24:35)
that's huge i you know what i was i got (24:32 - 24:36)
verified before serbia (24:35 - 24:39)
i'm not gonna brag but (24:36 - 24:39)
so how does that transition into you (24:40 - 24:46)
living in japan was that a school thing (24:44 - 24:48)
was that a work thing was that uh (24:46 - 24:50)
a pokemon thing because you were there (24:48 - 24:51)
for (24:50 - 24:54)
almost a decade right yeah um (24:51 - 24:57)
there so i lived yeah so well first of (24:54 - 24:59)
all i wanted to be a game designer (24:57 - 25:01)
like in middle school i was like okay i (24:59 - 25:02)
want to design games (25:01 - 25:04)
um and i think you know maybe for a lot (25:02 - 25:06)
of gamers that's like kind of the dream (25:04 - 25:06)
you know you (25:06 - 25:08)
love playing games and you want them you (25:06 - 25:10)
want to make them um and i kind of saw (25:08 - 25:13)
japan like many people do as kind of a (25:10 - 25:14)
mecca of (25:13 - 25:15)
game design stuff i think that's shifted (25:14 - 25:17)
a little bit um (25:15 - 25:18)
and you know like there's a lot of great (25:17 - 25:21)
game development studios in the us now (25:18 - 25:24)
um as well but at that time i like i (25:21 - 25:25)
just decided i want to be (25:24 - 25:27)
an exchange student i want to go to (25:25 - 25:29)
japan i want to learn (25:27 - 25:32)
stuff and you know like understand the (25:29 - 25:33)
culture (25:32 - 25:35)
you know that is behind some of these (25:33 - 25:36)
great games (25:35 - 25:40)
so that was kind of my reasoning for (25:36 - 25:43)
being a high school exchange student um (25:40 - 25:44)
and that was my (25:43 - 25:47)
i went there during 11th grade and (25:44 - 25:48)
stayed there for a year (25:47 - 25:52)
in osaka um and it (25:48 - 25:55)
you know it was great and i (25:52 - 25:58)
i always try to encourage people if they (25:55 - 25:59)
want to do (25:58 - 26:01)
like an exchange program either in (25:59 - 26:03)
school or college or whatever (26:01 - 26:05)
um to do it because you just learn so (26:03 - 26:06)
much about a different culture and it (26:05 - 26:09)
doesn't matter if it's japan or wherever (26:06 - 26:11)
i just feel like it's a great life (26:09 - 26:12)
experience so (26:11 - 26:14)
i'll give a little shout out to exchange (26:12 - 26:16)
programs but (26:14 - 26:19)
uh i you know it really it really was a (26:16 - 26:19)
good (26:19 - 26:21)
experience i didn't necessarily think (26:19 - 26:22)
that i would go back to japan (26:21 - 26:25)
after i came home but you said that was (26:22 - 26:27)
that was a year in 11th grade (26:25 - 26:29)
yeah yeah so then your senior year would (26:27 - 26:31)
have been in the states (26:29 - 26:33)
yep and then i graduated and kind of (26:31 - 26:34)
just did community college (26:33 - 26:36)
um because i at that point i didn't want (26:34 - 26:37)
to be a game designer anymore (26:36 - 26:39)
but i didn't know what exactly i wanted (26:37 - 26:40)
to be so i thought i would just get the (26:39 - 26:42)
general stuff out of the way (26:40 - 26:45)
and then you know go somewhere else but (26:42 - 26:48)
actually i started dating a japanese guy (26:45 - 26:49)
who was living in the states (26:48 - 26:52)
and he graduated um and was gonna go (26:49 - 26:53)
back to japan (26:52 - 26:55)
and i was like well i'm not really doing (26:53 - 26:56)
anything right now (26:55 - 27:00)
so um i temple (26:56 - 27:03)
temple university in philadelphia has a (27:00 - 27:03)
japanese (27:03 - 27:07)
tokyo campus so i applied there i got in (27:03 - 27:10)
and um then i switched colleges (27:07 - 27:13)
so i was you know i went over to tokyo (27:10 - 27:13)
and (27:13 - 27:16)
even after graduating um i just kind of (27:13 - 27:17)
stayed (27:16 - 27:20)
and was i was teaching i was teaching (27:17 - 27:20)
english (27:20 - 27:23)
for kids mostly and it was just a great (27:20 - 27:23)
place (27:23 - 27:26)
especially you know doing my website (27:23 - 27:29)
um to be really close to the beat of (27:26 - 27:30)
pokemon news (27:29 - 27:33)
um because a lot of times i'm sleeping (27:30 - 27:35)
when you know like the japanese news (27:33 - 27:35)
comes out (27:35 - 27:37)
yeah but there was there was no time (27:35 - 27:39)
zone issues really (27:37 - 27:41)
when i was living there and i could get (27:39 - 27:43)
a lot of cool footage and pictures (27:41 - 27:47)
and stuff um for social media and for my (27:43 - 27:49)
website so (27:47 - 27:51)
it just it just kind of worked out what (27:49 - 27:52)
made you come back was it (27:51 - 27:56)
the was it pandemic stuff no actually i (27:52 - 27:59)
i wanted to get married japan (27:56 - 28:02)
still doesn't have marriage equality and (27:59 - 28:03)
my boyfriend (28:02 - 28:06)
now husband um and i you know like we (28:03 - 28:08)
we were in it for the long term and we (28:06 - 28:10)
wanted to get married start a life (28:08 - 28:11)
together (28:10 - 28:15)
and then i also just you know like my (28:11 - 28:18)
my grandma has moved over to memory care (28:15 - 28:20)
and stuff and (28:18 - 28:22)
if if i hadn't had family issues that (28:20 - 28:24)
were pressing because of my grandma (28:22 - 28:26)
i could have stayed longer you know (28:24 - 28:28)
because marriage is just a piece of (28:26 - 28:28)
paper (28:28 - 28:30)
you know it's really being with the (28:28 - 28:31)
person you love and i could have done (28:30 - 28:32)
that in japan (28:31 - 28:35)
um but that was like (28:32 - 28:38)
a real motivating factor for me to come (28:35 - 28:39)
back so (28:38 - 28:41)
i came back i got married in the (28:39 - 28:43)
basement of her nursing home (28:41 - 28:46)
so she could be there um and it was (28:43 - 28:49)
it was honestly a great decision i think (28:46 - 28:50)
because (28:49 - 28:53)
then the pandemic happened and you know (28:50 - 28:54)
we're still not out of it but i can't (28:53 - 28:55)
visit her right now (28:54 - 28:58)
and i'm just so happy that i got to see (28:55 - 29:00)
um her before this all started (28:58 - 29:02)
dang you didn't warn me that i needed (29:00 - 29:04)
like tissues before this episode (29:02 - 29:07)
sorry that's a sweet story (29:04 - 29:11)
um wow okay uh hard to follow that up (29:07 - 29:12)
that's good let's (29:11 - 29:15)
shift gears a little bit uh because you (29:12 - 29:16)
you're you were in japan when (29:15 - 29:20)
um sword and shield dropped yeah so i (29:16 - 29:22)
i'd imagine that was we're gonna have to (29:20 - 29:24)
talk about national dexter's here for a (29:22 - 29:26)
second um (29:24 - 29:28)
so sword and shield people were really (29:26 - 29:30)
really hyped when the initial trailer (29:28 - 29:31)
dropped and i think where (29:30 - 29:33)
the the the conversation changed was (29:31 - 29:35)
around e3 where they said they weren't (29:33 - 29:38)
bringing the pokemon in (29:35 - 29:39)
and then the national deck stuff broke (29:38 - 29:41)
out obviously you know we're we're a (29:39 - 29:42)
year (29:41 - 29:44)
almost a year with sword and shield and (29:42 - 29:46)
it's sold incredibly well (29:44 - 29:48)
um the people that were unhappy and (29:46 - 29:49)
didn't buy it are still unhappy and (29:48 - 29:50)
still didn't buy it the people who did (29:49 - 29:51)
get it (29:50 - 29:54)
for the most part uh seem to enjoy it (29:51 - 29:58)
uh was there that outrage that you saw (29:54 - 30:01)
firsthand um or or were (29:58 - 30:02)
okay sorry i gotta clarify i will (30:01 - 30:05)
clarify i was actually in the u.s for (30:02 - 30:05)
the (30:05 - 30:08)
the launch um because i came back in may (30:05 - 30:09)
2019 (30:08 - 30:11)
i just double checked uh but for the (30:09 - 30:12)
announcement and everything (30:11 - 30:15)
for the announcement that was early yeah (30:12 - 30:17)
that was earlier i think there (30:15 - 30:19)
there was definitely a lot of heat in (30:17 - 30:20)
the japanese (30:19 - 30:22)
fandom too because i read the japanese (30:20 - 30:24)
twitter i don't know like (30:22 - 30:27)
by topics and stuff i don't follow a (30:24 - 30:27)
huge amount of (30:27 - 30:30)
accounts but like i'll dive in um when (30:27 - 30:31)
i'm covering different issues and just (30:30 - 30:32)
like (30:31 - 30:34)
see what's going on outside of our (30:32 - 30:35)
western (30:34 - 30:39)
um impressions or thoughts and stuff and (30:35 - 30:39)
i (30:39 - 30:42)
i want to see both sides so they were (30:39 - 30:45)
not not pleased i think and i think it (30:42 - 30:46)
was a very similar (30:45 - 30:49)
uh reaction to what we had really (30:46 - 30:51)
and then what were your what were your (30:49 - 30:53)
thoughts on sword and shield yourself (30:51 - 30:55)
when it arrived was it was it (30:53 - 30:57)
disappointing was it was it better than (30:55 - 30:58)
you expected worse than you expected (30:57 - 31:03)
what you expected you know what i will (30:58 - 31:06)
be completely honest i was i was running (31:03 - 31:07)
through that first (31:06 - 31:11)
route and i thought to myself am i (31:07 - 31:12)
getting too old for this (31:11 - 31:15)
and it was just such a weird thought (31:12 - 31:16)
because (31:15 - 31:18)
you know like i i've never really had (31:16 - 31:21)
that thought playing pokemon before (31:18 - 31:24)
but at first it was just like a little (31:21 - 31:26)
bit hard for me to get into (31:24 - 31:28)
and i don't know if it was just like the (31:26 - 31:29)
jump to the switch (31:28 - 31:31)
you know like i i'll be honest i never (31:29 - 31:32)
finished let's go (31:31 - 31:36)
um so i already kind of left that go um (31:32 - 31:39)
but i you know this was let's go the (31:36 - 31:40)
canto (31:39 - 31:42)
like what was the hold on before we get (31:40 - 31:43)
to certain shield what was the what was (31:42 - 31:43)
the (31:43 - 31:45)
did you have issues with let's go did (31:43 - 31:47)
you think it was a a bad game or (31:45 - 31:49)
shouldn't have been made or catered too (31:47 - 31:49)
much for (31:49 - 31:53)
casuals um no i actually appreciate that (31:49 - 31:54)
they (31:53 - 31:56)
are making a you know like i think if (31:54 - 31:58)
they separate the series a little bit (31:56 - 32:03)
i think it allows them to make a very (31:58 - 32:06)
guided experience for younger or less (32:03 - 32:07)
experienced fans (32:06 - 32:09)
um and hopefully my hope would be that (32:07 - 32:11)
they can retain (32:09 - 32:14)
a lot of you know the complexity and (32:11 - 32:17)
even add more complexity into the main (32:14 - 32:18)
line (32:17 - 32:21)
games um and let's go as technically (32:18 - 32:23)
mainline if you know you go with that (32:21 - 32:23)
but (32:23 - 32:27)
um you know for the non let's go titles (32:23 - 32:29)
yeah so for me for me it was just a (32:27 - 32:31)
little bit too guided didn't really (32:29 - 32:32)
offer me anything (32:31 - 32:35)
i i didn't like the catching system i (32:32 - 32:36)
think that was probably the number one (32:35 - 32:37)
thing (32:36 - 32:40)
um and it's so dumb but like after you (32:37 - 32:41)
release the ball (32:40 - 32:43)
and let's go it still like keeps the (32:41 - 32:44)
circle like keeps (32:43 - 32:48)
moving but in go it like stops you know (32:44 - 32:50)
like you flick the ball and the circle (32:48 - 32:50)
is like (32:50 - 32:53)
there still the same size so just like (32:50 - 32:54)
even (32:53 - 32:56)
that for whatever reason that small (32:54 - 32:57)
detail just annoyed me so much (32:56 - 32:58)
it was just like you know if you're (32:57 - 33:00)
gonna make a catching system that's (32:58 - 33:01)
based off (33:00 - 33:04)
go why why does it feel different you (33:01 - 33:06)
know like why am i trying to time things (33:04 - 33:07)
differently (33:06 - 33:09)
and it just was not a smooth transition (33:07 - 33:10)
and i was just like (33:09 - 33:12)
uh there's other stuff i could be doing (33:10 - 33:14)
right now yeah (33:12 - 33:16)
so and then and then jumping into sword (33:14 - 33:17)
and shield (33:16 - 33:19)
i'm not sure exactly what it was i think (33:17 - 33:20)
maybe it was still (33:19 - 33:23)
a little bit leftover feelings like from (33:20 - 33:25)
let's go that maybe this was (33:23 - 33:28)
gonna be too simplistic and i think the (33:25 - 33:30)
storyline you know like it is just (33:28 - 33:31)
it's a pokemon game you know you're not (33:30 - 33:34)
jumping in a final fantasy convoluted (33:31 - 33:36)
you know like whatever but but after (33:34 - 33:38)
that first route i started getting (33:36 - 33:41)
more into it i started uh enjoying some (33:38 - 33:42)
of the designs and stuff (33:41 - 33:46)
some of the little touches um so for me (33:42 - 33:46)
personally (33:46 - 33:50)
my impression was very positive of (33:46 - 33:52)
the games and you said you said at the (33:50 - 33:53)
start you're you're excited for (33:52 - 33:57)
crown tundra yeah yeah uh what was your (33:53 - 34:01)
how do you feel about the the dlc um (33:57 - 34:03)
the dlc route in general and of course (34:01 - 34:04)
isle of armor (34:03 - 34:06)
your thoughts on that but you know we're (34:04 - 34:08)
so used to having like a a third version (34:06 - 34:12)
of a game and they decided dlc this time (34:08 - 34:14)
i feel a little bit conflicted to be (34:12 - 34:16)
honest i love the new (34:14 - 34:20)
pokemon like glorion uh glorian slobro (34:16 - 34:22)
was super cool to me (34:20 - 34:25)
um and in some ways it just (34:22 - 34:29)
like it sucks that i can't use it (34:25 - 34:31)
on my team going through the storyline (34:29 - 34:33)
um and of course if you're just starting (34:31 - 34:35)
you know after i believe you unlock the (34:33 - 34:36)
wild area you kind of hop over to the (34:35 - 34:37)
isle of armor (34:36 - 34:40)
and do that but like for gamers who had (34:37 - 34:41)
already played through this (34:40 - 34:44)
you know we're past that point uh so (34:41 - 34:48)
i it's like so stupid in a way (34:44 - 34:50)
but i just love to like you know have my (34:48 - 34:51)
team (34:50 - 34:53)
with me and like it kind of builds up (34:51 - 34:56)
your affinity for these pokemon but like (34:53 - 34:58)
just catching a glorion slowpoke okay (34:56 - 35:00)
evolving it you know like (34:58 - 35:03)
it doesn't create the same bond no i (35:00 - 35:05)
feel you (35:03 - 35:07)
so i don't have like those fun memories (35:05 - 35:09)
of like i don't know defeating (35:07 - 35:11)
this gym or that gym with this you know (35:09 - 35:13)
pokemon and (35:11 - 35:16)
it was so in that in that sense i (35:13 - 35:18)
prefer third versions because if there (35:16 - 35:20)
are other forms if there are (35:18 - 35:22)
different pokemon to catch on the way (35:20 - 35:24)
that weren't you know originally (35:22 - 35:26)
available in that route you know you can (35:24 - 35:27)
you can more (35:26 - 35:30)
fully integrate it into your gameplay (35:27 - 35:31)
experience (35:30 - 35:33)
um and i didn't get that from the dlc (35:31 - 35:34)
but (35:33 - 35:36)
yeah that's that's super fair and i i (35:34 - 35:38)
kind of felt the same the only the only (35:36 - 35:39)
thing that i think (35:38 - 35:43)
outweighs that for me is not (35:39 - 35:45)
having to collect everything again like (35:43 - 35:46)
i don't want to (35:45 - 35:48)
stock back up on rare candy or (35:46 - 35:51)
experience candy large or carbos or like (35:48 - 35:53)
my other game has all of these and now i (35:51 - 35:55)
don't have them anymore (35:53 - 35:56)
well and i think that is one of the (35:55 - 35:58)
great things about (35:56 - 36:00)
the isle of armor because they just (35:58 - 36:01)
added so many good (36:00 - 36:04)
like quality of life uh features i feel (36:01 - 36:06)
like and even having the (36:04 - 36:08)
you know the dojo get the vending (36:06 - 36:10)
machines and like (36:08 - 36:12)
just having a lot of stuff there you can (36:10 - 36:14)
change your outfit you can heal or (36:12 - 36:16)
whatever without a long animation (36:14 - 36:19)
it was it did feel like a good addition (36:16 - 36:22)
to the game and especially for people (36:19 - 36:24)
who wanted to like (36:22 - 36:27)
create better teams yeah it was very uh (36:24 - 36:29)
very competitive focused uh if you were (36:27 - 36:30)
into that if you're into the vitamins (36:29 - 36:31)
and the (36:30 - 36:34)
move tutors and the restrictive sparring (36:31 - 36:37)
and stuff like that i draw the line uh (36:34 - 36:38)
at (36:37 - 36:40)
injections i won't inject my pokemon (36:38 - 36:41)
with (36:40 - 36:44)
chemicals but giving them (36:41 - 36:47)
vitamins i'll do that sure (36:44 - 36:50)
so crown tundra bringing back all the (36:47 - 36:51)
legends doing the co-op (36:50 - 36:53)
is there anything specifically you're (36:51 - 36:54)
looking forward to in that dlc (36:53 - 36:57)
um i'm actually okay so like (36:54 - 37:01)
i do really like the new reggie (36:57 - 37:04)
trio or well it's not trio anymore i (37:01 - 37:04)
don't (37:04 - 37:06)
okay i don't actually like the original (37:04 - 37:07)
reggie trio for whatever reason (37:06 - 37:10)
i'm just not into them but the new ones (37:07 - 37:11)
i really like (37:10 - 37:14)
the dragon and electric ones they their (37:11 - 37:15)
designs just really (37:14 - 37:18)
look cool to me so i'm excited to see (37:15 - 37:19)
those i really think they did (37:18 - 37:22)
a great job with the glorion bird trio (37:19 - 37:26)
so that's cool slow king is (37:22 - 37:30)
uh i i love it but i hate it but i (37:26 - 37:34)
love it so um i think that's all great (37:30 - 37:37)
i'm a little bit worried about the story (37:34 - 37:39)
um if it's super story focused i'm not (37:37 - 37:40)
sure if i'm gonna actually enjoy (37:39 - 37:44)
that part of it but the environments (37:40 - 37:46)
uh that you get to like explore and (37:44 - 37:48)
stuff have looked really cool from the (37:46 - 37:49)
trailer (37:48 - 37:52)
in my opinion yeah i don't know if i can (37:49 - 37:54)
say i was disappointed with the isle of (37:52 - 37:56)
armor story it's just kind of (37:54 - 37:57)
what i expected them to do which is like (37:56 - 37:59)
this (37:57 - 38:01)
short maybe two hours if you're a slow (37:59 - 38:02)
player (38:01 - 38:05)
experience well i i just thought that (38:02 - 38:07)
there was going to be something (38:05 - 38:09)
that was super replayable like a kind of (38:07 - 38:11)
a battle frontier (38:09 - 38:14)
sort of experience um (38:11 - 38:16)
and i mean they did add like some extra (38:14 - 38:17)
new (38:16 - 38:20)
things for like online battling but (38:17 - 38:24)
it just it didn't have the like single (38:20 - 38:24)
player (38:24 - 38:27)
replayability that i thought that they (38:24 - 38:28)
were going to be adding (38:27 - 38:30)
kind of yeah i thought that the two (38:28 - 38:32)
towers weren't going to be useless when (38:30 - 38:32)
you (38:32 - 38:34)
finished it and then the two towers (38:32 - 38:36)
ended up being useless (38:34 - 38:38)
yeah i was like okay what you know like (38:36 - 38:39)
i i thought they were gonna be like a (38:38 - 38:40)
battle tower (38:39 - 38:43)
ask situation so right yeah i thought so (38:40 - 38:44)
too i thought it was gonna be like (38:43 - 38:46)
endless floors or something that you (38:44 - 38:48)
climb (38:46 - 38:51)
uh but they're just two towers (38:48 - 38:51)
that exist nice though (38:52 - 38:58)
from the outside are you still playing (38:56 - 39:00)
go i know it's hard with pandemic (38:58 - 39:03)
but um you brought up how go was very (39:00 - 39:04)
different in japan (39:03 - 39:08)
yeah so i still play go um (39:04 - 39:10)
i'm i wouldn't call myself like a super (39:08 - 39:12)
uh (39:10 - 39:13)
i don't know invested player but i'm (39:12 - 39:16)
definitely a casual player and i love (39:13 - 39:19)
collecting uh my favorite pokemon and (39:16 - 39:20)
i just you know i like participating in (39:19 - 39:22)
the little events that they have (39:20 - 39:24)
as far as like the difference between (39:22 - 39:26)
the us and japan it was just so (39:24 - 39:29)
widespread um and i think part of that (39:26 - 39:31)
was just because i was living in tokyo (39:29 - 39:34)
where there's a huge population um i (39:31 - 39:35)
can't speak for (39:34 - 39:37)
rural areas of japan which i think (39:35 - 39:39)
probably are different (39:37 - 39:41)
in their experience of the game but for (39:39 - 39:42)
me like (39:41 - 39:44)
i could just i could see a raid (39:42 - 39:46)
happening (39:44 - 39:48)
and usually there would be people there (39:46 - 39:50)
you know there there wasn't a lot of (39:48 - 39:52)
time where i would have to (39:50 - 39:55)
try to take something down by myself and (39:52 - 39:56)
even if there was no one in the lobby (39:55 - 39:57)
you could like jump in (39:56 - 40:00)
and usually two or three or four people (39:57 - 40:01)
would jump in too because they're like (40:00 - 40:02)
waiting (40:01 - 40:05)
for someone to like take the plunge so (40:02 - 40:05)
it was just (40:05 - 40:07)
it was just so nice to be able to (40:05 - 40:09)
participate in (40:07 - 40:11)
the raid events and stuff and special (40:09 - 40:12)
pokemon that (40:11 - 40:13)
appeared in like five star legendary (40:12 - 40:16)
pokemon really most of the time (40:13 - 40:18)
just because you know there was there (40:16 - 40:20)
was so much transport and (40:18 - 40:23)
activity um but in minnesota where i (40:20 - 40:24)
live now (40:23 - 40:28)
um besides like the community (40:24 - 40:31)
days i don't see that but (40:28 - 40:35)
i think probably like mall of america um (40:31 - 40:38)
is our big mall here in minnesota and (40:35 - 40:40)
i think there's probably there there'd (40:38 - 40:41)
probably be a kind of a similar (40:40 - 40:42)
experience (40:41 - 40:44)
i'm sure i don't that's like an hour (40:42 - 40:46)
away from me so i don't (40:44 - 40:48)
get up there very often and especially (40:46 - 40:49)
now during the pandemic (40:48 - 40:52)
i wouldn't but i'm i'm pretending this (40:49 - 40:54)
there's not a pandemic and (40:52 - 40:56)
hopefully this will go back to normal in (40:54 - 40:58)
the future but (40:56 - 41:00)
yeah when i've uh visited minnesota mall (40:58 - 41:01)
america was for sure the (41:00 - 41:05)
the place to be for for pokemon go (41:01 - 41:07)
oh but you know actually okay so (41:05 - 41:08)
touching on this (41:07 - 41:10)
one thing i will say that has really (41:08 - 41:11)
helped keep me (41:10 - 41:14)
alive right now at my job there's (41:11 - 41:15)
actually (41:14 - 41:17)
a group of pokemon go players um and we (41:15 - 41:20)
have a slack chat to communicate (41:17 - 41:23)
so that has been a huge thing for me (41:20 - 41:26)
and actually my where i work to would (41:23 - 41:26)
have (41:26 - 41:30)
they had um a gym and well several gyms (41:26 - 41:31)
around (41:30 - 41:33)
and also a pokemon stop that could be (41:31 - 41:35)
accessed internally like when without (41:33 - 41:36)
leaving (41:35 - 41:40)
the building um so i felt really lucky (41:36 - 41:41)
that i got a job where i did (41:40 - 41:45)
and um that is that helped me keep like (41:41 - 41:46)
the (41:45 - 41:49)
momentum kind of going um until like (41:46 - 41:50)
everything became (41:49 - 41:52)
work from home and now i have i have (41:50 - 41:53)
nothing around me so (41:52 - 41:56)
i appreciated niantic's work like play (41:53 - 41:58)
from home (41:56 - 42:01)
uh bonuses that just ended yeah (41:58 - 42:04)
i'm a little salty yeah (42:01 - 42:07)
a little little weird on why (42:04 - 42:10)
now out of all the time (42:07 - 42:13)
i remember when i was in japan for (42:10 - 42:16)
three two two and a half three weeks (42:13 - 42:17)
there was (42:16 - 42:19)
uh in osaka where that giant gosh that's (42:17 - 42:22)
like that bridge with the running dude (42:19 - 42:26)
oh yeah yeah yeah i remember there was (42:22 - 42:27)
there were raids popping non-stop and (42:26 - 42:30)
every raid it wasn't even like an event (42:27 - 42:31)
like i could i think it was like a (42:30 - 42:34)
two-star i don't know (42:31 - 42:35)
like a menchino or something something (42:34 - 42:38)
no one cared about and they would just (42:35 - 42:40)
fill to 20. and yeah and look around and (42:38 - 42:41)
you could see you could (42:40 - 42:43)
i mean it's very easy to spot a pogo (42:41 - 42:44)
player they're the ones tapping their (42:43 - 42:47)
screen and not looking at it (42:44 - 42:49)
but it was kind of crazy how people just (42:47 - 42:50)
like they would show up they would just (42:49 - 42:52)
join the raid there was like no (42:50 - 42:53)
communication and then when the raid was (42:52 - 42:55)
over everyone just dispersed but (42:53 - 42:57)
if you walk to another raid it was like (42:55 - 42:59)
the same thing and that was kind of my (42:57 - 43:01)
entire experience in japan of like (42:59 - 43:04)
the game is just more maybe because (43:01 - 43:05)
japan is so (43:04 - 43:07)
close together with everything and it's (43:05 - 43:09)
like very hard to like not walk (43:07 - 43:10)
10 feet without uh something being a (43:09 - 43:13)
pokestop yeah that i mean that's true (43:10 - 43:13)
too like there's (43:13 - 43:16)
there's a lot available you know at (43:13 - 43:18)
least in the city so (43:16 - 43:20)
yeah yeah it was a pretty wild (43:18 - 43:22)
experience and (43:20 - 43:24)
so you being you being over there for (43:22 - 43:25)
nine years you had (43:24 - 43:27)
you know constant access to pokemon (43:25 - 43:28)
centers you had (43:27 - 43:30)
all the gotcha machines that were at (43:28 - 43:32)
like train stations and (43:30 - 43:35)
bus stops and stuff uh and that stuff is (43:32 - 43:36)
like regularly updated i remember (43:35 - 43:38)
walking into like a 7-11 and they just (43:36 - 43:41)
had like pokemon face masks (43:38 - 43:44)
or like pokemon lotion yeah that stuff (43:41 - 43:45)
is like everywhere over there (43:44 - 43:47)
i still have i have not opened but i (43:45 - 43:50)
bought one of the bulbasaur face masks (43:47 - 43:53)
you know like the beauty face masks i (43:50 - 43:54)
should probably open it before it dries (43:53 - 43:55)
out (43:54 - 43:58)
i guess that would be a special youtube (43:55 - 44:00)
video i guess (43:58 - 44:02)
do you do you like miss that that (44:00 - 44:04)
culture though i mean like i think (44:02 - 44:06)
i think japan obviously being number one (44:04 - 44:08)
with pokemon stuff and america being (44:06 - 44:10)
number two but i can't walk into like a (44:08 - 44:11)
gas station and (44:10 - 44:14)
find anything pokemon here yeah it i (44:11 - 44:14)
mean like (44:14 - 44:17)
it really does it really does suck for (44:14 - 44:19)
people in the us and i'm sure it's the (44:17 - 44:20)
same way in europe although europe (44:19 - 44:22)
doesn't even have the online pokemon (44:20 - 44:26)
center so it was jarring to come back (44:22 - 44:29)
but it's probably saved me money so (44:26 - 44:31)
maybe i should be glad but the funny (44:29 - 44:33)
thing is i actually (44:31 - 44:35)
worked in one of the same buildings (44:33 - 44:36)
because (44:35 - 44:39)
there it was the classroom was kind of (44:36 - 44:39)
um (44:39 - 44:42)
located in an office building um that (44:39 - 44:44)
was connected to a mall (44:42 - 44:46)
and that mall had a pokemon center in it (44:44 - 44:48)
so i was just able to like get off work (44:46 - 44:49)
go to the pokemon center and then go (44:48 - 44:52)
home like and i would work there like (44:49 - 44:52)
twice (44:52 - 44:56)
a week for a while so um (44:52 - 44:58)
yeah i mean it was just crazy like it it (44:56 - 44:59)
took no effort (44:58 - 45:02)
to you know like go anywhere and find (44:59 - 45:03)
pokemon stuff (45:02 - 45:05)
right i remember getting off the uh off (45:03 - 45:07)
the plane um (45:05 - 45:08)
i was like i wonder how long it'll take (45:07 - 45:10)
for us to see something pokemon and it (45:08 - 45:11)
was like literally (45:10 - 45:13)
instantly there was like a pokemon (45:11 - 45:14)
vending machine right off the plane (45:13 - 45:18)
yeah yeah the the pokemon center is (45:14 - 45:19)
there they update (45:18 - 45:22)
like almost weekly right with new stuff (45:19 - 45:26)
yeah i mean it's i basically it is kind (45:22 - 45:28)
of weekly isn't it because i do cover (45:26 - 45:30)
like the updates to the merchandise on (45:28 - 45:31)
twitter (45:30 - 45:33)
and you know like every week they (45:31 - 45:34)
announced you know (45:33 - 45:36)
goods and those aren't sold for you know (45:34 - 45:37)
three more weeks but it's just this (45:36 - 45:39)
rolling cycle and (45:37 - 45:41)
so you're there are you know like it's (45:39 - 45:43)
not gonna be boring i guess if you go to (45:41 - 45:45)
a pokemon center one week the next week (45:43 - 45:46)
you're probably gonna find something (45:45 - 45:49)
fun and new so are there plans for you (45:46 - 45:51)
to eventually go back to japan maybe (45:49 - 45:52)
when the (45:51 - 45:55)
world isn't imploding anymore yeah well (45:52 - 45:55)
actually (45:55 - 45:58)
um my husband's sister had a baby so we (45:55 - 45:59)
are just (45:58 - 46:01)
we are dying to go back and see his (45:59 - 46:02)
family (46:01 - 46:06)
and meet our new nephew so it's been (46:02 - 46:07)
it's actually been hard to be away from (46:06 - 46:09)
japan because we actually had plans to (46:07 - 46:10)
go back (46:09 - 46:14)
um this fall and that's not gonna happen (46:10 - 46:15)
now but (46:14 - 46:18)
uh as soon as possible we will we will (46:15 - 46:20)
be back not for pokemon specifically but (46:18 - 46:24)
i you know will probably go uh to a (46:20 - 46:26)
pokemon center (46:24 - 46:29)
maybe buy a few gotcha machines so what (46:26 - 46:30)
do you what do you think is (46:29 - 46:33)
is next here uh on the the i guess your (46:30 - 46:35)
expertise or your speculation (46:33 - 46:36)
you know we're getting we're getting the (46:35 - 46:39)
next dlc and by the time this episode (46:36 - 46:41)
goes up in like two weeks (46:39 - 46:44)
uh do you do you see more dlc do you see (46:41 - 46:45)
uh (46:44 - 46:47)
a remake of diamond or pearl which i (46:45 - 46:48)
don't think the internet has (46:47 - 46:51)
showed up about since the remakes of (46:48 - 46:52)
ruby and sapphire (46:51 - 46:55)
do you see another let's go game do you (46:52 - 46:56)
see (46:55 - 46:59)
you well anything else i i don't i (46:56 - 47:01)
you know what it's so you know i have no (46:59 - 47:04)
special insider knowledge about anything (47:01 - 47:07)
but it just i'm open i'm ready (47:04 - 47:10)
for anything and i would be fine if (47:07 - 47:11)
there was more (47:10 - 47:12)
sword and shield dlc there are still (47:11 - 47:14)
pokemon that weren't (47:12 - 47:17)
you know added with these two dlc (47:14 - 47:18)
releases (47:17 - 47:21)
um but on the other hand okay let's go (47:18 - 47:23)
i'm going to give let's go a second (47:21 - 47:25)
chance if one of them is let's go togepi (47:23 - 47:26)
for jodo (47:25 - 47:29)
i would be fine with that um because one (47:26 - 47:30)
of the one of my favorite things about (47:29 - 47:31)
those games (47:30 - 47:33)
were like the customization you could do (47:31 - 47:36)
and i love togepi i actually loved eevee (47:33 - 47:39)
um but oh you mean customizing your like (47:36 - 47:40)
eevee character (47:39 - 47:44)
yeah yeah yeah (47:40 - 47:48)
um but honestly i kind of (47:44 - 47:52)
i kind of think that we'll (47:48 - 47:55)
be done with the dlc almost for a sword (47:52 - 47:56)
and shield and then maybe (47:55 - 47:59)
move on to the next thing which which (47:56 - 48:01)
could be like (47:59 - 48:03)
a collection of pokemon games released (48:01 - 48:04)
for the switch (48:03 - 48:06)
like past games because there have been (48:04 - 48:07)
rumors (48:06 - 48:10)
about that so we'll have to see whether (48:07 - 48:12)
it's actually going to be a remake of (48:10 - 48:12)
diamond (48:12 - 48:14)
pearl or like they're going to wait (48:12 - 48:16)
until gen 9 to do that (48:14 - 48:18)
um and you know maybe they're just going (48:16 - 48:19)
to (48:18 - 48:21)
release release kind of a multi-pack for (48:19 - 48:23)
the switch of (48:21 - 48:26)
of games for like the 3ds so (48:23 - 48:29)
i'm not sure and your site unlike um (48:26 - 48:30)
cerebe (48:29 - 48:33)
reports on rumors yeah we do and i get a (48:30 - 48:34)
lot of flack for that (48:33 - 48:38)
um online and i think a lot of people (48:34 - 48:40)
maybe view my site as being like (48:38 - 48:41)
unreliable (48:40 - 48:44)
um because of that but i do my best to (48:41 - 48:46)
make it very very clear you know like (48:44 - 48:48)
when we're covering rumors i (48:46 - 48:50)
include red text at the top you know (48:48 - 48:51)
this is (48:50 - 48:54)
do not believe that it's okay yeah but i (48:51 - 48:55)
just i think that (48:54 - 48:59)
being able to talk about rumors and like (48:55 - 49:02)
possible you know additions or ideas (48:59 - 49:03)
added in the games (49:02 - 49:06)
um i think it's fun for fans and it's (49:03 - 49:07)
fun for me (49:06 - 49:09)
so you know if it wasn't fun for me i (49:07 - 49:10)
wouldn't do it you know like (49:09 - 49:12)
some people do think it's just for like (49:10 - 49:14)
clickbait and stuff but honestly (49:12 - 49:16)
what i find interesting is what i put on (49:14 - 49:17)
this website so (49:16 - 49:20)
yeah i mean like uh i know we we on the (49:17 - 49:22)
podcast covered the um (49:20 - 49:25)
pokemon stars rumor pretty closely but (49:22 - 49:27)
the main reason we covered it is because (49:25 - 49:29)
there was pretty good (49:27 - 49:30)
it was it was coming from a pretty (49:29 - 49:31)
reliable source i mean it was coming (49:30 - 49:33)
from eurogamer which (49:31 - 49:35)
you know they they got this they got the (49:33 - 49:37)
sun and moon stuff pretty early (49:35 - 49:39)
they got the switch stuff all right (49:37 - 49:41)
before the switch even (49:39 - 49:44)
released so it was like it's kind of (49:41 - 49:45)
really hard to ignore (49:44 - 49:48)
where the source is coming from and (49:45 - 49:50)
whether or not like stars was a real (49:48 - 49:51)
thing or it was cancelled or it was a (49:50 - 49:53)
code name and they changed it i mean (49:51 - 49:55)
it is what it is i don't think a lot of (49:53 - 49:57)
people even remember it at this point (49:55 - 49:58)
but (49:57 - 50:01)
sometimes it's hard to ignore the uh (49:58 - 50:02)
what was that (50:01 - 50:04)
oh it was the incineroar primarina and (50:02 - 50:05)
decidueye (50:04 - 50:07)
that was leaked and then everyone (50:05 - 50:08)
thought they were fake and then (50:07 - 50:11)
yeah it was it was like eight months (50:08 - 50:13)
early we saw them (50:11 - 50:14)
and then we were like whoa these were (50:13 - 50:17)
real the entire time (50:14 - 50:20)
yeah and you know what props to joe for (50:17 - 50:21)
not deleting his tweet (50:20 - 50:23)
saying they're not real um i have mad (50:21 - 50:24)
respect for him for (50:23 - 50:28)
you know like keeping that up um (50:24 - 50:29)
it's you know like those are the wild (50:28 - 50:31)
times or even like i (50:29 - 50:35)
i posted the um picture of the (50:31 - 50:37)
trainer writing lapras before let's go (50:35 - 50:38)
was revealed (50:37 - 50:40)
i mean sometimes there's just like weird (50:38 - 50:42)
leaks that you know like just pop (50:40 - 50:43)
up out of nowhere and you don't know if (50:42 - 50:45)
they're real you don't know if it's fake (50:43 - 50:45)
but (50:45 - 50:47)
uh sometimes they do turn out to be (50:45 - 50:50)
legitimate i cannot wait till uh (50:47 - 50:53)
the day that gen 4 remakes do eventually (50:50 - 50:55)
happen and the (50:53 - 50:57)
the second they're announced the gen (50:55 - 51:00)
five people start (50:57 - 51:00)
i am such a gen five fan so i will be (51:00 - 51:04)
probably the loudest i'll be like okay (51:02 - 51:07)
where where's my where's my gen five (51:04 - 51:08)
remake (51:07 - 51:11)
yeah your uh your website's mascot is (51:08 - 51:13)
sawaddle (51:11 - 51:13)
i almost i feel like it was made for me (51:13 - 51:17)
like i just saw that and i was like okay (51:15 - 51:18)
this is it this is (51:17 - 51:22)
this is a representation of my (51:18 - 51:26)
website and of me personally maybe (51:22 - 51:29)
do you think with like go and the tcg (51:26 - 51:30)
and the anime and pretty much everything (51:29 - 51:32)
the pokemon company (51:30 - 51:33)
pumps out like this machine that they (51:32 - 51:37)
are do you think over the years the (51:33 - 51:39)
pokemon community has gotten more (51:37 - 51:41)
divided or more different it's (51:39 - 51:42)
definitely gotten bigger there's no (51:41 - 51:46)
denying it there with go alone um (51:42 - 51:48)
but it feels for me it feels slightly (51:46 - 51:50)
different than it did like five years (51:48 - 51:50)
ago (51:50 - 51:54)
yeah i mean i think it was much tighter (51:50 - 51:54)
knit (51:54 - 51:57)
and i think a lot of um from my (51:54 - 51:58)
generation (51:57 - 52:01)
of i don't know what my generation (51:58 - 52:03)
really is defined as but like (52:01 - 52:05)
i got in when pokemon forums were the (52:03 - 52:07)
thing you know like fans were not (52:05 - 52:10)
there was no twitter there was no um (52:07 - 52:11)
whatever (52:10 - 52:13)
so we were all on these you know forums (52:11 - 52:14)
and (52:13 - 52:17)
you kind of knew who people were and (52:14 - 52:19)
you know like we were using msn and aim (52:17 - 52:20)
and stuff (52:19 - 52:22)
to chat you know like outside of the (52:20 - 52:23)
forum so (52:22 - 52:26)
um i think you knew who people were a (52:23 - 52:27)
little bit more (52:26 - 52:29)
um whereas you know like everyday new (52:27 - 52:31)
twitter accounts are popping up and (52:29 - 52:34)
you really you don't have that same (52:31 - 52:36)
connection with other fans (52:34 - 52:37)
and it's so much more it's so much (52:36 - 52:40)
easier i think to interact with people (52:37 - 52:41)
um now because you don't have to (52:40 - 52:44)
register for a specific website based (52:41 - 52:46)
around a specific uh (52:44 - 52:49)
you know pokemon theme so (52:46 - 52:53)
there's just such a lower barrier uh to (52:49 - 52:55)
enter these online conversations now i (52:53 - 52:56)
think (52:55 - 52:59)
um but i like some people do think like (52:56 - 53:00)
pokemon fans are super (52:59 - 53:03)
toxic and stuff and i have to say that i (53:00 - 53:04)
think (53:03 - 53:09)
there are just there's just toxicity in (53:04 - 53:12)
everywhere in all fandoms um and (53:09 - 53:14)
you know like it's some people (53:12 - 53:16)
pigeonhole you know like gamers are (53:14 - 53:18)
toxic or pokemon fans of dogs but it's (53:16 - 53:21)
it's truly like kind of the nature of i (53:18 - 53:23)
think the internet and what it's evolved (53:21 - 53:24)
into because (53:23 - 53:27)
any fandom and for me i'm a huge fan of (53:24 - 53:28)
the um (53:27 - 53:31)
drag queen show rupaul's drag race and (53:28 - 53:32)
it's just (53:31 - 53:35)
amazing if you dig into that um fandom (53:32 - 53:38)
which is you know it's got a lot of gay (53:35 - 53:40)
people it's got a lot of trans people (53:38 - 53:41)
you know like there's female fans (53:40 - 53:42)
there's male fans (53:41 - 53:46)
um and it is so toxic you know like (53:42 - 53:48)
so it's the exact opposite of like the (53:46 - 53:49)
kind of this white male (53:48 - 53:52)
gamer stereotype of toxicity um (53:49 - 53:54)
and so like it's really kind of opened (53:52 - 53:56)
my eyes that i think there's a (53:54 - 53:57)
there's a larger problem and it's (53:56 - 54:00)
probably you know it does (53:57 - 54:03)
it it kind of needs to be addressed but (54:00 - 54:05)
you know like it's it's hard you know i (54:03 - 54:06)
think (54:05 - 54:09)
i don't know i hope that we as community (54:06 - 54:09)
can be (54:09 - 54:11)
a good example for other different (54:09 - 54:12)
fandoms (54:11 - 54:15)
i think the national dex issue (54:12 - 54:19)
kind of had a really (54:15 - 54:22)
maybe a negative impact on the way maybe (54:19 - 54:23)
other gamers (54:22 - 54:26)
saw the pokemon fandom but (54:23 - 54:29)
i really hope that we can be kind of a a (54:26 - 54:30)
positive (54:29 - 54:32)
force for good so that's what i that's (54:30 - 54:34)
what i try to promote (54:32 - 54:39)
when i'm not like picking on cerebe yeah (54:34 - 54:41)
well i think that's that's all that's (54:39 - 54:42)
all we have i mean i could i could (54:41 - 54:44)
probably keep you but i know (54:42 - 54:47)
