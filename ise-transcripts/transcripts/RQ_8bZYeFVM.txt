[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 411 episode of the Pokemon podcast it's super effective I am your host SBJ with me today is Bobby hey how's it going nice to be back after a nice long break from recording speaking of a long break from being on the show al is here hello from very sunny and warm Europe I can't tell if that was sarcasm or not no no it's like 24 degrees here today or something they'll see us yes yeah yeah yeah Harry yeah what a certain American degrees 75 ok ok ok oh that's nice that's nice it's about my upper limit we got Bobby and Al here Gregg and will out for the week hopefully they're being safe not gonna miss a week here I took the last couple days off twitch just as a vacation but obviously podcasts still happening whether uh I don't know the Sun is in the sky or not there will always be a podcast on Monday so we're gonna get through this and get you your Pokemon news yeah I wish we knew what raids were rotating on Monday night because Meowth will be over so if you're listening this Monday morning and you have not gotten your Giganta max me out get it but we will have some new raids on June the first app I think it rotated well it rotates at zero UTC which is like 7:00 p.m. Central Time I think I think it's because it's 4 p.m. Pacific so I think it's isn't it 5:00 Pacific is it is it 5:00 o because time changed yeah my pad I don't know I understand TTC I think it's I think you're right I think you're raves do well it's it's kind of worse for me right because half of the year I am at the same time is UTC and then work so most of the time when someone says UTC I don't to calculate anything but then in the summer I obviously have to add on an hour which is annoying oh lucky you because yeah it's it's we're like seven hours or eight hours behind depending on the time of year yeah you guys do uh daylight savings time too yeah not for long though hopefully really getting rid of it smart move although it's not confirmed whether the UK will is or not but like let's not get into that Europe European Union is getting active daily same thing alright well let's jump into the news I have in front of me here I think most of this is good news this is off Anime News Network calm the Internet's most trusted anime news source according to the tagline this actually just came out right before we started recording but the Pokemon journey TV anime resumes new episodes on June 7th after the Cova 19 delay this is uh the first time that the Japanese anime has kind of been off the air for quite a while but they're back on June 7th the staff was temporarily suspended part of its production series due to the corona virus I had because of the state emergency declared in Japan Japan has lifted the state emergency nationwide this past Tuesday the twilight wings was also delayed but the fifth episode is scheduled for June 5th and I believe there is no word or the new movie which was supposed to come out July 10th there's no rescheduled date for the Coco movie but the Japanese anime returns on June 7th highlight wings for everyone on June 5th and then or us customers the first 12 episodes episodes of Pokemon journeys TV adventure I don't know what it was a series called Pokemon the journeys poke my journeys this is a series the series that comes out on Netflix on June 12th and then so that delay didn't didn't hold up the first 12 episodes was that where those films were those my studio audience so what episode were they on in Japan at 2200 you wanted to uh yeah okay got it that makes sense them and that was on the 18th of April I believe this is the longest gap in since their Paragon episode in the anime what was that that was our weeks that was it was a four-month one actually oh whoa Wow it was from December the 16th till April the 16th there was more than the porygon episode there was other yeah but they were all short they were all like just a couple of weeks yeah that was like Japan's huge initiative to like change a bunch of stuff cuz yeah Pokemon wasn't the only cause of that I was gonna say wow that big it for that one episode if you're one of our Canadian listeners it's already on the first episode VN may already appeared on Teletoon Teletoon le tele tune on may 9th i also believe it's either happened last Saturday or is happening next Saturday that the first four episodes are airing in the UK but then we don't get any more till September what what do you say regular TV or do well you get you guys have that flicks and Hulu and everything but we do but we're not so we're getting it on TV channel that I'd never heard of before called pop for your next channel no apparently has been around for ages but yeah they're there they've announced that they're going to do I think is four episodes on Saturday or lasts actually I Cameron which one so four altogether play in a row yeah I think so four on one day and then one again anymore until September what an odd choice I know yeah I mean year ago but going back to the movie being hold I that doesn't surprise me just because that's probably more due to the movie theater situation than it is yeah you know the movie itself and I don't see movie theaters well I guess some are already opening but I feel like the smart decision to be to keep movie theatres closed for a longer period of time so this is the first time a movie is a Pokemon movie has not debuted in July yeah assuming I mean I guess it could come out like July 30 but yes originally scheduled for July 10th so we don't have a we don't have a date on that I'm sure Anime News Network the Internet's most trusted anime new source will keep us up to date well just knock out the Pokemon masters news right away just somebody characters got added full disclosure I do have a partnership DNA dawn and Turtwig have been added to the game and she'll run between May 27th through June 10th and I believe jasmine and steelix are still a band that you can pull on and I believe there is a the flying-type Advent is still going blind type training event is still going to June 4th and then the battle Villa Refresh will go till June 11th ok so I have played this game for about a total of 12 minutes ok ever so I'll have you played it at all or are we in a complete world where it's just Steve you know I think I think I'm the same as well yeah we're gonna really miss Greg on this one cuz ya know I started it and when ya know I'm all right thanks I didn't find him yeah it was I don't know I think that if I wasn't already playing other mobile games I may have picked it up but it was just another game that I I didn't want to jump into it just didn't didn't grasp my attention as quickly as I would have liked yeah I'm Steve you I assume you're still playing and pulling stuff and trying to get the best pairs and everything uh yeah I'm I'm more trying to get like one of every pair hmm which is now seemingly impossible it feels like because at this point I'm just balling a bunch of duplicates right right I know I don't ever sit there I've said this in the podcast before I remember sit there and play this game like an hour straight or two hours straight or try to like get everything done in a day I just do a couple matches when I wake up do a couple matches right before bed and that's it and it's been enjoyable for me but that's how that's how like other mobile games I played like clash Royale you know I'd wake up I'd do like two matches I'd be like sitting at a dentist office I'll do a match like right before bed I'll do a match and that's that's it like I never sat there and played like three hours of clash Royale in a row like I mean there's nothing wrong with that just not your style not yeah not my style but see I'm the opposite I think like I have a hard time if I pick up a game just playing it for a few minutes and putting it down like if if I if I only have a few minutes to kill I'm you they're gonna be hopping on Twitter or Instagram or something I like to be able to sit down for a little bit of time and play a game and obviously that's made Pokemon go a bit different now that it's all at home instead of being out walking around but yeah I know I'm not a big fan of just the open it for a couple minutes and close the game don't really work for me the main reason I brought up a lot of these dates is like DOM and the battle Villa and flying-type event is they're all ending the second week of June I don't know I look I don't have any inside information but it's no secret that the sword and shield TLC is coming out sometime in June so I'm just curious if there will be just like how Pokemon go has the which we're going to talk about the the gallery Pokemon being added I'm curious if masters will do anything of the sort because I'm sure they will right yeah cuz they'll always all match up together which is cool which is very cool of them to do I guess we'll just have to wait and see so gallery Pokemon in Pokemon Quest / yes quest will get updated and masters will get updated at the same time oh how I wish I was actually thinking about going back and playing quest again cuz I was going through my games on my switch and when all it was a fun game I didn't do it I thought about it though it's a good get I love quest clifftop great game all right speaking of the Pokemon good stuff we have a whole schedule here from Niantic about what's coming to Pokemon go and this is off Pokemon go live.com Zechariah's Pokemon go debut and more in June people like the Zekrom let's start off with the best possible news June's research breakthrough encounter trapinch yay from June 1st to July 1st trap pinch the ant pit Pokemon will be available in research breakthrough just what we always wanted yeah alright that community today with less than a year ago wasn't enough I was actually quite liking having chinks because you know it was a weekly chance of getting a shiny Ching's same well you have absolutely chance of getting a shiny trapinch actually I still have today as my research breakthrough so I have I can get one more chance at a shiny Shinx today yeah you better get that Shing I would my my quick read on the Internet is people were unhappy about the trap inch and still you know we're we're over six months now and people are still complaining that there's a lack of legendary sinner in these research breakthroughs I feel like that boat has sailed I don't know look the new thing to complain about is denying go back to leak anymore right right yeah I said well research breakthrough they've left go battle II and now you got to buy that remote raid pass well and I get them from your home yeah and I don't like to complain about these things too much but even if I do buy a room will read pass I'm never gonna be able to you get the legendaries because there's nobody near me playing just now I used to get all of my raids in Edinburgh which I can't go to legally just now so how well you got away for those no one invites no doing rows uh 6:00 p.m. right hours for you oh no no the issue is I can see one gem from my house and everyone at the is in the vague area is like miles away they can see other gems like I'm sure that's great for people in cities but it just does not work here kind of but I'm it's funny I can actually see 12 gems from my house and those raid hours still the people like the groups that I'm in like the facebook Messenger or discord groups that I'm in they all just happen to be a little bit further east than what I can see so even though I can see 12 gems none of them ever have anybody actually reading for the most part during those raid hours I mean I'm grateful to be able to ac-12 gems from my house because I can do a lot of solo raids but when it comes to those tier 5 ones it's a little bit harder for me to do them even though I have so many gems around me I go to the same park on Wednesdays it's the same group of people and what's just the word awful pretended I use the word awful define they exist oh no it's just 45 minutes of hearing them shout about shiny 100 IV Pokemon they caught during Helios with quaza how to pronounce a lute yeah uh you know I wasn't standing close enough to them like the only word that's ever stands out from when they're yelling at each other is the word shiny but I wasn't standing close enough near them to hear them pronounce Russia Ram I feeling like Russia rhymes pretty easy to say yeah that's not I don't think that's too bad I just like the image of Steve pulling up to a park it being like your whatever music you're playing in your car and as soon as you turn your car off and get out it's just 12 people yelling at each other for 45 minutes and then you're getting back into your car music turning on and you're driving home that's a hundred percent how my Wednesday's are it's fine just just wait till Arceus comes out you'll have fun with the pronunciation oh yeah yeah yeah that's gonna be terrible hopefully by then they've figured it out an in-game thing that pronounces the names I've been is there even a Pokemon okay so when when when research had Legendary's people complained about that that's this is the problem is it's not it I don't think poor trapinch getting all the hate but I remember specifically when it was Latios latias in research people were complaining that like a lot T us a lot T us or just we have enough we don't need them anymore give us something else or if it was nap dose or Articuno room all trace you know people are like Dodds Dex filler none of these Pokemon are actually good it was really bad when that was there Reggie's pre shiny and everyone was like pitchforks in the air running toward Niantic headquarters just yeah I mean you're never gonna make people happy could put dialga and Palkia in field research with a with a hundred percent chance of shinee and people would still complain because like after the first week they would be like huh this is I'm sick of state like I don't know what Pokemon they could put in field research that would make people happy and it's field research it's so easy to do right I think you I think you're thinking about this the wrong way right don't try and think about which Pokemon would make people happy but think about how they could change it to make people happy so obviously this is a lot more than just deciding which Pokemon to go into but if they had a way for you to actually be able to decide which Pokemon you got out of up a group of them then I feel like that would be a lot closer especially if you know say you could choose between a legendary or another Pokemon that is guaranteed to have very high stats you know that sort of thing would probably keep most people happy within a within reason that's true I'd be kind of fun if yeah if there was like a a you got like a choice of legendary or like you said like high Ivy's or or like really good go battle League or something you know like you had the options like that and then you work towards that and yeah yeah it doesn't even need to be like a specific like choose a Moltres or of whoever I'm so good up on the what's popular and battling but but yeah it could be as you say just like groups of them so you choose between which group you want to do that's probably a lot more work I think also people forget that like you get experience you get a chance at a you know bastogne I think there's probably still a sinister tone and that role too yes cuz I've got them likes to be weeks in a row I was gonna say yeah because all I'm ever seeing our sin up stones so they die no we still know our stones [Laughter] like we're complaining again okay I got three another stones in a row one one time it was sweet Wow shoulda bought a lottery ticket after that seriously I think the thing you suggested al is really cool I just it's just that field research is so incredibly easy that yeah especially now with them giving us a new task every night that's like transfer 10 Pokemon every every day I'm like accidentally doing one of these things right like I really I just want to get to the point where I have no completed ones because that little circle is always orange and is really annoying having always orange because you don't know whether you've done one of the reasons the those research or whether you've done one of the the special research or one of them like total one the timed ones yeah it's really annoying it's like I just want to complete these but of course I don't want to use them up because then I won't have one for tomorrow it's a hard life hey I still have I there was a you remember the what was it April Fool's event with that crow got was a Croagunk in like sudowoodo and yeah yeah yeah I still have the catch three ditto task which will give me a Croagunk which I'm sure if I delete this task it would have been a shiny pro dunk you're looking so fit us now holding on to this the other day I go +2 ditto and I was like okay so I just need one more but I've been holding on to it since I don't know mid April I was like I got the task like an hour before the event ended when there was all the ditto spawning so didn't have a chance to catch my three one day one day I'll get that third data Zekrom makes their electrifying go debut on June 16th the deep black Pokemon will be waiting for you to challenge in five star raids it will be featured every Wednesday starting June 17th June 24th and July 1st that's really interesting because that takes us into the time period after the dlc will have been released right yep so obviously they're gonna wait till after that before anything related to the DLC comes well I feel in terms of like died legendry they rotated they have done overlapping events before haven't they so they could just uh believe again I'll never mind ignore me better believe they like to overlap events again this yeah so we got the throwback challenge 2020 special research congratulations to trainers who completed all four times research lines you've earned access to the throwback challenge champion 2020 special research joined Professor willow as you

Colleran Meowth gallery' and Zigzagoon and glaring daraa mukha and gallery' and stunfisk from 7k eggs plus try evolving Colleran Meowth Zigzagoon and Dodaro mukha okay that try they wouldn't work the ticket if you missed it will be $7.99 you cannot use pokey coins to buy it you must use some real money I have a love-hate relationship with it's fine' it's just annoying for somebody who buys like $100 worth of pokey coins to last six months yeah and then go feel like an aunt decision it reminds me of that episode of The Simpsons where Homer is like takes the kids to like the fake Disneyland itchy and scratchy land and like the guy is like would you like to buy some itchy and scratchy money and he's like yeah sure and he buys a bunch and then he walks into the theme park and everywhere says like we do not accept itchy and sketchy 100% whatever reminds me of it's weird right because you assume that the reason they're doing it right is so that you can't like use the free coins to do but by that logic if they used the free coins to buy the ticket they then wouldn't have the free coins to use on something else and if they're the sort person isn't then going to buy the coins to make that up they wouldn't have bought the ticket in the first place so I don't think this would actually gain them any extra money it just seems like a really weird weird decision to make it almost seems like and I have no knowledge of this haven't looked into it anyone is has more knowledge than great please tweet me whatever but it almost seems like it's almost related to like the legality of when they call things event like based on how they call things events like in digitally and how it can't be in-game care it seems almost like there's a standard behind it because like you're saying how I don't actually see this making them a whole lot more money than what you're already saying so it almost seems like there's something more behind it that has to do with I don't know something with their terms and conditions or something with their with the weak ality of how they're doing it but again I don't know it could just be hey maybe we'll make a few extra bucks would be I mean I guess I guess the one thing the one thing it could be if it wasn't some legal thing are you thinking of you're you're suggesting is I guess it could be kind of getting people into buying stuff so you're ready a little video yeah exactly so many people won't buy coins right because it's not really something they're buying whereas if it's are especially their community ones right whether $1.99 like they're under under a quid a dollar and yeah you know that that that's really easy to just go oh yeah fine I'll do that and then if you didn't like have your credit card information in Google Play or iTunes then you know do I know it's much easier to then buy things in the future and it's almost yeah it's it's a lot of people I've seen talking about well I'm not gonna buy this because I don't I don't spend money on this game where eyes if they had already spent money on it they probably would have done it so maybe it's something like that that makes a lot of sense are all all arrays my last thought and go with yours out cuz makes life sense for the $7.99 ones right because they're that's much less that's a lot more to kind of commit to whereas if you've wake up in the morning for community then you say oh there's one that's ninety nine P and it gives me a bunch of stuff you're like yeah I'll do that eight pounds that's quite a lot more yeah that's true I will say I like I like the I like that this event is free for the people who did it although they probably should have announced the ticket beforehand cuz when we'll talked about missing the first week he was like well now I have no drive to do the rest of the weeks because I can't participate in this event when it happens so I do like okay if you missed it if you're busy you can still participate at $7.99 and there are definitely games that do that like Final Fantasy 14 they have like a Halloween event or an Easter event like usually at the end of that event you get like a free mount like a writable item so you can ride through the world so like for the Halloween event it was you know complete these four tasks in the two-week period you get this low witch broom that you can ride around and then once the event is over if you missed it you can just pay $4.99 in the store and get that witch broom and it's it's nice because it doesn't it's like the opposite thing of what like destiny 2 does which is hey only this week you can earn this one emblem and if you don't earn it it's gone forever and then you start to get in this mindset of like I can't I literally can't keep up with all these events and then once you once you like miss one and then you missed 2 and then you missed 3 you go I don't care anymore but they don't want the player to not care right they want the player to care to do the events but at a certain point if you don't give players a chance to participate some other way then they're just going to walk away from your game yeah I mean I see I see two sides to that because I'm also seeing I agree more with let's give people multiple options to get something but I'm seeing the side of well things aren't exclusive anymore because people can just pay for them whereas I did all this work I'm quote air quotes work to you know get the the genesect and now someone can just pay eight dollars and get the genesect as well and it's not exclusive and well quite true because you still have to do the work to get it right it's not as much work as doing all of the four and then the fifth one but you still have to do all the fifth it's not like you pay eight dollars and then genesect just appears in your inventory that's true that is true and and I agree I also just think that it's okay first off you can't even trade mythical x' so yeah it's not worth anything I guess unless you go on eBay and sell your account to someone which shiny legit squared Charizard is at least worth two dollars come on right right I know I guess you guys went all through this last week but I think that there's a lot of look at what I have look at why I have that you see from well social media in general but with these what people want to call exclusives and I think that cares you should be able to just give players like multiple ways of gaining something so I'm okay with this I also agree that it should have been maybe stated at the beginning but I think they were trying to go for the surprise element and kind of do like a or maybe they hadn't even have it planned in the beginning to do it that way but when they realized a lot of people maybe they realized after the first week not a lot of people do care yeah they're like people didn't care enough for or didn't complete it so they're like oh we should give them another way of doing this either way I think it would have been nice to have that set at the beginning and then people would have had more of a an option whether you know it will wouldn't have been like well now I'm over this because I can't do it you know it people I feel like may have been a little bit turned off by that and then maybe wouldn't have been had they known that it was an option later they could by I guess yeah they didn't say how much Stardust or that you would get instead of professor Willis glasses but I don't know if you it's like worth it for me or you to if you completed all four events to spend another $7.99 I can't look I have a hundred and ninety star pieces so I'm not paying eight bucks for some star dust oh my face Steve with his rare candy could use them or delete them right also 594 rare candy so yeah goes right me insane look I I I have the rare candy back up again waiting um my star pieces yes our dust star so okay so here's my my thing when I first played this game I was in a very high traffic area where I worked where we raided and everything all the time so we're just constant raids all day long it was great and I used a lot of star dust then and I powered up a lot of stuff as much as I needed that was level forty so a lot of stuff got as high as it needed to since then I haven't read own trade nearly as much I switch jobs I'm in an area where I don't work as much now I'm just at home working so I don't rate as much so everything I have kind of fits like anytime a new raid boss comes out I have something that works against it and I powered enough in up at the time to deal with that so lately I've been powering up more stuff so I can try to beat stuff with less people but until a couple little remote raiding came out like I just didn't really have a reason to power the stuff up so got up to like 7 million Stardust's you know and the reason I don't use my star pieces is cuz I forget I have them so there's that I shouldn't just have to bake a bag I'm still the person that pops the lucky egg when when I have like forced our friends to check off oh absolutely the same I was telling a couple of people in the slack the other day I was like hey let's you know line up for we're gonna hit best you know do you want to turn a lucky I gone and people were like aren't you level 40 like but there's still XP to game number so that keeps changing so at 50 million so I gotta hit that 50 if they hit the number I don't think people would nearly as care as much but the fact that that number changes if they hit the number I throw all my lucky eggs away yeah same well let me tell you I the minute I turned level 40 I deleted all my spare lucky eggs every single one I've got since then it's gonna straight in the bin hi God not need that nonsan steel if they ever implement the ability to send items through three gifts rather than just random gifts I will send you any lucky eggs I get all right don't want them if I could send them to someone I would it's just that I only have I've only paired myself up to thing a thousand space in my bag I don't need that's nonsense in there a thousand spit yeah see that's my problem set out my bag is too big I lose things I have 89 fast EMS I'm gonna use those yeah like 50 to charge teams I don't agree I don't go battle league enough deleted for these things well I yeah so hard to delete things do you keep all your pokeballs as well or do you leave them or maybe pokeballs about example because you use that with the pokeball + yeah yeah usually the great balls get deleted first the poke balls I have two key for the the plus and then the altar balls are usually like I'll burn through all the ultra balls on community cuz I want I don't want some thumb to break out so I'll just use the altar else I mean there yeah well community today is an interesting one why why I tend to do is I walk with my poker ball plus in one hand and my phone and the other tap once the poke of all plus notices something I tap on that Pokemon if it's not shiny I just get the pokeball plus two to do yeah cuz I don't really care about catching everything and if it's shiny I'll do it manually make sure I definitely get it but yeah like I don't I don't manually catch most of the pokemon on community day that's a smart move I never really did that when I was out walking around these last two I've been so since this thing for me is since the quarantine stuff started and the at-home stuff started I had a baby right so I had a baby on March first and then all the shelter and play stuff happened starting like right after that so I haven't left the house for multiple reasons but these last two community days I definitely haven't been able to really Ivan really got out and walked around so what I have been doing is just go Plus for like the entire 6 hours because the incense are three hours apiece right so I've just been talking to incense that gives me that six hours and then check it every few you know every 30 minutes your buddy brings you 50 pokeballs or whatever so just kind of check in on it hopefully I get my you know three shinies and then kind of be on my way but it's mostly just bingo plus let's last couple months but once I'm out walking around and stuff going to parks for community again I'll probably do that and just check on and then go Plus um if they're not shiny because that makes a lot more sense yeah alright we got two more things to talk about pokemon girl related but we'll take a quick break and then when we come back we have some TCG stuff and some Pokemon Center stuff so we'll be right back [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] another episode otherwise [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] not only do we have the genesect event in June we have two other events here the bug-out event is returning and the Solstice event is returning I think these are returning events right they've they happen Laster yeah we definitely saw this one definitely a bug-out event I feel like we had we had a bug event at one point I feel like but yeah in I don't know if it was like in June but the Solstice event was obviously but there's really no details here for these events except these the Solstice of solstice event will run June 19th through June 24th and the bug-out event will run June 26 through July 1st and that's pretty much eat it so they're both week long assuming that there will probably be new shinies assuming though it probably be eggs where people will be upset about what is in the egg course standard I am sure if somebody didn't complete the genesect event these events will block you from needing to do what you need to do right I think we already can tell what the shinies are I mean I think we're gonna talk about it but based on the spotlight our events oh yeah yeah because the spotlight our events highlight two Pokemon that are already shiny one fire-type Pokemon that's not shiny yet and one bug type Pokemon that's not shiny hit so people were a bit disappointed by this there's gonna be no spotlight our for June 2nd now Pokemon will go we'll be down on June 1st for I think like eight hours they said it's pretty long time yeah first time I was it's a database migration so they want to make sure they've got a lot of time is that what it is that's I think that's what they said that they want to migrate the database for some reason okay cuz I know people we're not given a details on it theories and stuff and you know you had everything from we're gonna get I don't know every shiny in the game and then all the way down to no they're just doing some maintenance and need to fix yeah I personally thought maybe I had to do with adding some back-end stuff to like this social features they're gonna put out eventually I mean the problem is race so it's it's not like they've never really had to have this sort of maintenance before other than issues around login at the very beginning right most of they generally deal with these things pretty well so like adding in features generally doesn't make sense right the way that they do is if they have a server change there are you know when you have a client it can handle the old server and the new server and the old the old client just handles the old server and then when you want to switch over to the new server you just MIT you just don't let people log in unless they have the new client right is pretty easy so so they've not really had any issues with that whereas a database um database migration if they actually want to change what the database is on because they that like that's kind of a really intensive thing to do and so they need to make sure that they get all of the data over correctly so what they do is they just say nobody can do anything at this point and then we know that this is all of the data we can migrate it all over and we know that by the time we finish migrating there isn't any new data in the old database before we then migrate over before we were before we then open up again and so really I think that's the only thing that we would make sense and I'm sure they've said it somewhere but I can't find it it's now gotcha yeah that would make sense now I know very little about any of that but I was wondering like if they did like a database migration would they be able to do something where you know how we have like there's like data miners now who go in and figure all this stuff out before it happens like is there a way that they could go in to be securing that so people can't do that or is that not gonna ver are they're always gonna be able to be data miners because yeah it's unlikely cuz it's mostly local data that they've been data mining got it okay yep oh right of course cuz it's when the update hits they're able to jump in and and look at it that way no spotlight our June second which is a bit of a bummer because I personally like the spot a spotlight ours a lot but it's the day after their maintenance so that's probably the reason why but spotlight our will return on June 9th it'll beep attract and you will earn that twice the XP for a volume Pokemon June 6 teenth will be numel numel I think it's numel and you will earn twice the amount of Stardust for catching Bobby make sure you turn on your star peace oh yeah I sent a reminder okay Tuesday June 23rd which will be during the solstice event it will be Clefairy and spotlight you will earn twice the amount of xp for catching and if you're lucky trainers that's what it says here you'll do you will encounter a shiny Clefairy and then on Tuesday June 30th cricket tot will appear in spotlight and you will earn twice the candy for catching so I think what Bobby hinted at was cricket top will be the bug out shiny new mo may not or normal may not be because I didn't realize that that spotlight event happens three days before yeah so then starts well Clefairy makes sense for the Solstice event because the salsas like Sun and Moon oh right and don't really but it's there's a loose connection this hence the name is to do with the Sun right Sol Sun yeah but I can definitely see them going or Sun that means moon as well and oh man does this mean that Clefairy is permanently gonna stay shining like sudowoodo and magmar have unless they pulled those recently but I'm pretty sure sudowoodo and egg mark still be shiny I think they can still be shiny as well umm it sucks that we have to say we think that nee antic left them right yeah I mean they did leave magmar for sure before so unless they just decided to randomly turn it off then and magmar should still be shiny I don't know I think well I don't know I think that they should keep them shiny there's no reason why they shouldn't I still think I don't know I still think that numel will become it would be weird to me if normal wasn't shiny but they've done it before they did with purloined they did a whole purloined hour with no shiny right and then they've done a shiny for everyone after that though right so even like Wobbuffet they allowed they that was when their debut Wobbuffet being shiny in the wild instead of having to catch a oh really oh yeah so I'm Robin fit our that way Wobbuffet was shiny in the raids when I had the party hat yeah and I don't know that people caught it I don't believe it was shiny in the wild until that spotlight hour which makes me feel like the purloined thing had so much backlash from it not being shiny that they've done it and they've done a shiny ever since I feel like Noma will be shiny but who knows we'll see June 16th all right final bit of Pokemon go at news here is save-the-dates pokemon go fest 2020 will happen around the world this july pokemon go fest will be July 25th and 26 it's being fully reimagined in a virtual format that will bring fun at trainers around the world this global event will take place Saturday June 25th and Sunday June sorry July 25th and Sunday July 26 ticket holders will be able to participate during both days of the event like previous go fest Pokemon go fest 2020 will feature a weekend packed with bonuses challenging special research encountering encounters with exciting Pokemon and much more plus you can look forward to connecting with other trainers and enjoy activities during go fest throughout the summer and that's it and in the picture because everyone always over analyzes the picture we were guilty of this as well there's a cherrim an oddish a Jigglypuff and a lowland execute' or in the pictures and a Pikachu and last year I think there was a Haunter which there was there was ghastly spawning at go fest last year there was a Haunter in the picture it meant nothing besides like gasps Lee was there like there was not a single wild hunter you could even catch it go fast it was just I think my favorite is that one was that people were like oh it's a hunter that means that they're gonna turn on Chinese for all levels of Pokemon like like plays a really big stretch right yeah I love those theories that's amazing yeah there's not I mean obviously like the biggest the biggest thing about the picture right is that it's like in a back yard so yeah you know there's no standard for tell us having a backyard with very perfect plants and trees growing and we all have that back yard well I mean I said it's a back yard it and say it was the standard backyard Bobby's like it was actually my backyard I just offered them a photo and they they took it uh-huh a go-fast has been anywhere between what 20 to 30 bucks you know 25 there's no way it'll be as expensive as the real-life one right though because like that goes towards the physical event whereas there aren't any costs relating to that but it is gonna it's probably going to be more expensive than your like your genesect or your um Reggie ever when it was Reggie Reggie waitress over both 799 yeah I I I'm gonna guess 15 it's like safari zone pricing right what were safari zones I didn't I didn't I think there were plenty of them so yeah horizon's' 20 I'm gonna say $12.99 war okay that seems low yes doesn't seem low like that seems low for what Niantic would make it in my opinion it's gonna be a weird number I think for one if I have you like 15 27 right that weird but I think it's gonna be like I'm gonna go with 16.99 okay alright do you think they're gonna do an early access to or it's like you get to play two extra have they done that for any digital-only events ah no no they weren't right having it for the safari zones so far as the n go fest they have early access I guess technically the safari zones are digital only it's just digital only in a specific place like they don't have any pop-up stuff like there mmm like your whole fast that's true JB they well then I don't know did the Safari Zone stuff it you'd stuck with that like if you had that early access pass you got a couple extra hours right yeah but it was still only in the same location wasn't there like a an explorer Pass thing you could buy for the safari zones - yeah the London had a City Pass and I think Philly had a City Pass but hey don't even know what those entailed yeah in London or do you mean Liverpool Liverpool sorry I mean neither of them happened in real life anyway so I don't think we can right jump to any you know no is my question was just for those because they didn't happen in real life did people find it for the explore pass stuff that's note it was gonna entail anyway but you could have applied for a refund but you wouldn't have gotten that one off day that people got they take that away from you well then if you if you opted in to take the makeup day your pass is still valid for a future event which they haven't disclosed when or what that would be got it okay but if the future event is something you can't attend because you're out of town or you're sick or you moved you don't get a refund at that point because you've accepted that you had a makeup day right okay got it get all legal stuff I was going to deliver per one but then we decided me and my wife decided that I would only do one of one of Liverpool or Worlds and I was going to do world of course neither of them happened so I've not well I mean nobody's the winner except the hotel and the airline because I've not got my refunds for them yeah no a whole will you get them I I'm meant to be getting them but it's one of these things with her like it will take it could take up to 90 days and you don't actually get to can request the refund until close to the time anyway because that was like August wasn't it yeah yeah yeah I can't have the similar situation with my trip abroad I couldn't really care for him to like five days before yeah that's annoying yeah I was actually meant to be flying to the old man a couple of days ago and and I have managed to request the refund for that but it's not come through yet so I'm on the weird situation where the flight never happened and I couldn't have gone on it but I've not got the money back yet just there another me to read there that you had to get to Oh memories that was good fun I highly I legitimately considered doing that just flying over for the weekend just to do that buy it and it I'm not doing it cuz that's silly [Laughter] hey my wife was up for it that team as well this is off that's all agro news this next bit of news is off gonna Tendo Pokemon company and Mister donuts collab in Taiwan Pokemon company and Mister Donut some work together the past when it comes to Japan but now the two are collaborating for the first time in Taiwan right now there's just some artwork new details coming on June 2nd so there's a very cute picture of a simple Pikachu with two Donuts floating around his head if you don't know mr. donut is mr. donut is probably like the Dunkin Donuts of Japan they're like everywhere very easy to walk into get a doughnut get out they have done plenty of Pokemon like when I was there in Japan actually Andrew who is our resident Japanese reporter we went to I went to mr. Donuts with Andrew and they had Pokemon toys for kids so I ordered off the kids menu so I could get the Pokemon toys nice of course as you do I feel like I feel like I don't understand any more with your explanation of it's like Dunkin Donuts however I also feel like it's probably not that difficult it's a place they make donuts they make sure they have three oh of course cuz because you can't really have a shop that sells food without coffee obviously right right I'm sure they maybe have tea as well probably so what does I don't know why you bring that up so it what is this like teaming up include is it just they're announcing all the details on Tuesday June 2nd so we don't actually know this is the best story ever something to do with Pokemon and Donuts they're both great things yeah I'm gonna happen we don't know I don't think anything bad could happen it sounds awesome oh I see no issues here well there is one issue the fact that is not here yeah that's true there's no mr. Donuts in America or Scotland sad this is off this was sent to me media alert Charizard and aterna tests make their Pokemon v-max debut in the new Pokemon Trading Card Game sword and shield darkness ablaze expansion I actually believe that this expansion got renamed last minute due to co vyd or that's the speculation at least what was it going to be called so as I originally supposed to be called they changed it in Japan - it's called infinity zone in Japan but it was supposed to be called world that down oh yeah it was changed due to the negative connotations due to Cove in nineteen oh yeah I was having a great history in that don't they huh so the English name is darkness ablaze the Japanese name was supposed to be world down but they changed it to infinity zone sure yeah not great right so darkness ablaze will introduce Charizard v-max as the fan-favorite chartered makes its Giganta max form debut in the TCG just like pokemon sword and shield video games in additions trainers will be able to pull more Pokemon from the gala region as Pokemon Vibha max poke such as sent a scourge of Emax and grim snarled vmax of the legendary pokemon aiternative vmax in its unique eterna max form I guess I don't know if was that ever I've stated in the games that that was what its form was called that turned him out his mom I don't know if Lee stated in that games but I've definitely heard that term before today yeah I think it was definitely in the code of the game so definitely the the miners got a a of that I think and I might be wrong I think it might have been mentioned once when it went into its so when you're when you're battling it and it goes into you think it's fainted and then it goes into in turn a max form I think it says it in once since their and then never ever again hmm but I might be wrong so this expansion for the for us will have seven v-max we already know some of them I think this will also include me max Butterfree cuz yeah that didn't come out in the last set it will have fourteen Pokemon V cards plus nine full art Pokemon v-cards seventeen trainer cards for full art supporters three new special energies are you still in the big on collecting the TCG stuff I am Steve still deep end too many cards on my desk Japanese and English I haven't ordered okay I you pulled my leg I ordered a box of infinity zone which I believe comes out June 2nd okay but I did not order volcanion explosion or whatever the last set was called what explosive Walker it's explosive Walker yeah I did not order a box of that okay but I do have a box of infinity zone on my way what does a box consists of how many packs a box is thirty packs of five cards his Japanese packs are five cards English packs or ten I didn't realize Japanese ones were smaller that's not interesting they weren't always right because I used to apply a lot of Japanese cards but this was a long time ago ah and it was the same amount I feel like his English cards in the packs I want to say when they changed the back of the cards which was like 2011 they like changed everything about it a u.s. pack of Pokemon cards is ideally 399 but I feel like recently it's gone up to like four dollars and 20 cents yeah 4:29 usually yeah um so Japanese packs are 200 yen which comes to like a dollar eighty yeah so it's the same like value yeah but the more plastic yeah but these sets are significantly smaller and I believe although I don't have the I don't I'm sure there's a source somebody on the Internet in like a 20 minute YouTube video has like calculated the odds but people say that your poll rate is better in the Japanese set but I don't know if it's better because there are less cards so when darkness ablaze comes out there will be over a hundred and eighty five cards in that set but in the Japanese set there's only like a hundred cards isn't that due to the fact that like like in the Japanese there'll be another set that's like 85 cards that the Americans hats put together into one set right so we we didn't get explosive Walker it's a terrible name and we're not good so so with with the last set that came out which was what was it called rebel clash mobile clash was v-max rising plus rebellious clash plus like one other set okay right right so jets the Japanese players get one set every month the English players get one set every three months so they've merged sets together and these sets become very big and seemingly impossible to collect so I bought cash I bought two boxes of VMAX rising and so a box of VMAX rising is like I don't know I think it's I think it's 5000 yen which comes to like 46 dollars and I got every card from that set except one not counting secret rares secret rares are like the shinies of the set but the actual set is pretty much complete Wow and the only one I was missing I think was v-max Rilla boom and I pulled like three v-max sind races instead so yeah that's and one intelligent Elian i have purchased gosh not not any of these sets I did buy a box of sword and shield which is 36 packs of 10 cards so it's 36 packs 10 cards each $100 and not even not even close to completing the set with that one box and that was buying a whole box buying two elite trainer boxes buying probably 20 single packs and then buying like a couple of the you know tax tricity VBox or Polti guys to be box which comes with like four packs ah that's not even close to completing the set I have to imagine that see the last time I collected pokemon card I mean I bought a pack here and there I'll buy typically after you show off some really cool full artwork card it gets me all like hyped up to buy more pokemon cards because I don't play the TCG but I do love collecting them from time to tell you it's just over so overwhelming once I start to realize like how many there are to collect like I can't imagine that there is that the percentage of people who buy Pokemon Trading Cards there must be a such a small amount that are like the complete leanness collector for them I feel like just because it's like so hard to come by all of them especially when you have the secret rares now and all of that stuff which like it wasn't a thing back when I was collecting them but this was like 2002 or whatever so yeah the secret rares really really kind of double down on the people who like to collect Chinese except when you're hunting and X&Y for a shiny it doesn't cost you right exactly exactly well they're they're like some secret rares that are like worthless like price wise but you would still want them for your collection like oh I need the secret rare it's like two bucks on troll and toad I'll buy it but when you're doing that for like eight secret rares or you get a secret rare that is pretty expensive like I think what was it was it it was in a Sun and Moon set it might have been like guardians rising or something there's like a secret rare Charizard which is like a reprint of an older Charizard and that's like a $60 card okay and so it's like well I have almost all of sudden moon I'm missing some secret rares I'm missing the secret rare Charizard oh that just happens to be the most expensive card in the set at 60 bucks but it's the one I'm missing still cheaper than a box of of packs that's true yeah yeah which won't have it probably but the question is can I buy a box for a hundred bucks and is there enough cards in there that I can sell to make the hundred dollars a pack right and do you sell your cards I I did sell my entire collection before X&Y came out so I had so I collected pretty much from heartgold SoulSilver triumphant triumphant something it was like the last heartgold SoulSilver set and then they moved into black and white so it was black and white and then it was like emerging powers and then that was a really bad set there was a bunch of other black and white sets and then it got into the plasma freeze and plasma storm and plasma whatever and so that was I collected all of that mostly for competitive and when I decided to get out of that and I think I think that was probably time in my life where I was like broke all right sure which is like every day of my life but I ended up selling all those cards to cool stuff Inc for about 750 dollars Wow and then I had two cards that I sold separately to a friend for $100 each so that was so altogether 950 dollars of selling all of that and I probably spent more than that though because like every time I set every three months I spent probably $200 on cards right we get like two boxes that's just I think I think I figured out why you're you're broke yeah that's uh that's intense just doing that like collecting I have I have the entire very first set that's the only thing yeah I still have that and I still have that and I'm not getting rid of that and I because I was heavy into the collecting with the first set that second third I don't know it was like up until like the rocket cards or whatever would they have the little like rocket face on the card it's like a rocket team members oh yeah like a rocket like team rocket's Charizard my Bonnie's Persian yeah it was like then the gym leaders and then there the rocket cards and all that and then I and then yeah and then I stopped collecting so I think it was my first base set jungle fossil rocket and then gym leader I think gym leader might have been the last time that I was like heavily collecting the cards and then since then I've just like here and there I'll buy a few packs or a box of something from time to time if I'm in the mood uh so darkness ablaze comes out August first some plenty of time literally over two months this does bring up one interesting thing though right because this is the first time you can have an eternal Max eternity in any form and so when are they bring into the game please and thank you [Laughter] I don't know if you know this Al but there are two DLCs coming out this year my last bit of news super short super easy there's a ton of new merch on Pokemon Center they brought the mystery dungeon plushies over which are the little blushes with the ribbons around them there is a purple kecleon for mystery dungeon it's not shiny I keep hearing people call this shiny kecleon purple kecleon is not shiny quickly huh it's just the weird color they decided for mystery dungeon I think kecleon has like the only thing that changes in shiny is like it's Charlie Brown stripe changes from like blue to red or red a blue oh there's a purple kecleon in the anime oh yeah that's weird it's just like the Butterfree the ash ashes yeah yeah that's not a shiny Butterfree it's just a pink one right right like the blue magic carpet Magikarp Jim not shining but good-looking they added a bunch of outdoors they added in like an outdoor collection so this features like Pikachu and like a little camping hat and then they introduced a summer collection which it's very weird that these two collections were close together but I'm assuming due to like production delays with merchandise because of probably Co vyd that one was supposed to come out earlier and it didn't but the there's a complete summer collection with an inflatable Lapras pool thing pool floatie if you're into that they're an inflatable flappers pool floaty thing in inquest it's not one of the decoration items oh I think so yeah no I think there's a Lapras pool I think though back that's just there are pokeball beach balls there's a fisherman hat there's a bunch of thin summer hoodies there's water bottles and then for the camping stuff there is like plates and cups there's a cooler there's fanny packs and then there's like flannel because you know when you go camping you wear flannel obviously so yeah a bunch of new stuff on Pokemon Center and that's pretty much all our news Oh should we talk about the community Day vote results oh yeah I mean I need a large to say wheedled and gastly I always find it funny how selfish Pokemon go players are and how mad they were that people were voting for squirtle like look not everyone was playing the game like there are new players every single day - Pokemon guy right the people that were like who's looking for squirtle well that squirtle community day was two years ago just trade somebody for it really yeah that's like I don't want to talk to any of you people everyone say just trade somebody for it is a person I don't want to treat yeah I will say I was uh I was a little bummed that that sandshrew didn't take second I would have really liked the Sandshrew community today but I still don't have a shiny Haunter so I'll be okay with gastly community today in July right so it'll be wheedle in June and then gastly in July yeah yeah no Greg this week Bobby so you are you are question of the week we need that we knew that theme song okay I've got nothing nothing how about Al why don't we do only flip it to Alan I know this is usually my thing when Greg's gone but you know I'll come back like I feel like give him that shot I'm like I've been preparing something it's a little bit different okay I would normally do okay but I thought I'd bring a bit of my own culture to the podcast okay all right so please excuse me if this is dreadful [Laughter] when I wake up well I know I'm gonna be I'm gonna be the man who answers the question of the week for those who aren't aware that is the Proclaimers the beginning of the Proclaimers song 500 miles that was the final song that we played at my wedding for any section that was our final song as a reception all right this is from Brandon with glaring forms coming to raids what are some non canto Pokemon that you would want to get gallery' and forms but okay non canto Pokemon that I'd want as a Clarion form I'd say two of my two favorite Pokemon besides far-fetched our summer goal and a while so it would be really fun to have both of those as valerian types especially because neither of them are wait because smear is not in the game so that would be fun there's my boils button sword and shoulders it my Wiles and sword and shield yeah it is okay but it's like the opposite of sable I think I think sable is exclusive to one mall while exclusive the other I think oh yeah no of course it is because I definitely moved it up to through-through home and put it in my game or at one point a shiny one um yeah I think I think Hariyama would be good I feel like Hariyama deserves a little love they pure hiding pure fighting type or did they like make a fighting fire now they've never made a fighting fire pokemon ever we are the ghoul Aryan I've not looked into this at all but are the gallery' inform pokemon all pokemon that their non glare Ian's form is a single type no cuz slowpoke was psychic water and glare and slowpoke is psychic oh yeah they like flipped it and then corsola was like water rock and it's gallery' inform is just ghost I think okay got it IIE before the game I can kick their before the game came out I really like the idea of a Clarion oh goodness where does name is gone Cal do I had geladen Cal deal but now we have bonito which kind of takes over that so what I was also thinking was I think it'd be really nice to have a goal Aryan lollipop line I'm not sure how you would redesign it but I just really like the idea of that line being associated with what you know the region that is partly based on Scotland um but yeah I do [Music] all right and then you're done that's it all right could there be could there be a Pokemon that you could redesign into a haggis oh boy what just because it's a sheep yeah yes inside out Murray there's like a lot of gen5 love and sort and shield I mean they'd they they have the yeah mask there they have to say sigilyph they have the scraggy garb order is like the only non gen1 pokemon to get a GMAX form now not counting gen8 pokemon of course oh yeah that is true is it really the only non na janam one or jelly 108 yeah I know how that decision came to be his garb order is sweet okay man there's so many Jen I'm like looking at the list and like the amount of Gen 5 Pokemon in sword and shield is is actually incredible there's no bouffalant though unfortunately but we know all our vests is coming back do we have any more there hasn't been any more information on the DLC since we initially write like trailer or anything like now I would I would assume or probably get information this week or next week right yeah well tomorrow's June so it's coming out tomorrow right right yeah where's my game it is a bit weird do you think do you think they've just kind of held off on any news because they thought there's a possibility it might be delayed um and they just want they didn't want to say anything until they knew for certain uh well they're still putting out I mean obviously we still have things to talk about every week so they're stopped putting out pretty frequently pretty frequent Pokemon news I wonder if it was because obviously their Japanese company and Japan had a state of emergency that just got lifted this past week so maybe they were waiting for the state of emergency to be over possibly yeah they do have an advantage in unlike a normal game launch they're not relying to on physical media for this one so they don't have my issue yeah that's if there's ever a time yeah but even with the Pikachu Eevee Meowth and now the like get your free mr. mine ponyta corsola Meowth another behalf like I don't think any of these decisions have been last-minute like I think these have always been in the pipeline yeah right and yeah but I guess the decision to delay we would probably be in a last-minute thing if I had to do it no I I think I think we're good the only reason I could think of maybe they didn't want to say a date is if they needed just that extra week not to finish the game I think it's probably done at this point but the extra week of like hey instead of putting it out on June 12th let's just wait two weeks to the 26 just because of world events or because of other things happening so it gives them a little flexibility yeah yeah I do find it interesting that they never have done that for games right so obviously they didn't know when they announced it that this was gonna happen right yeah but they still didn't announce a date at that point where is almost every game maybe not the very first one like there are some times where it's like oh coming holiday or whatever but normally by the second bit of information which is normally only like a month or so later they generally have to date by that point well there's never been a second bit of information to to give us a date a date right there was just like the announcement of it and then there hasn't really been any like newer information there was the announcement and I was like that Nintendo that Nintendo thing where it was like 19 minutes long and it like open with Xenoblade cuz it always opens with Xenoblade and now the Xenoblade Zout will probably get 18 more trailers of Xenoblade this year yeah they definitely had more information in that one because they told us a bit the dojo a mountain and stuff and I don't think that was in the original and yes they said about the dojo and then we saw the slowpoke moving very quickly near the end of the trailer you're right okay I was waiting those together in my hair and then they actually said like in telly in out loud and they said is it Doral Adhan I think they said Doral Adhan out loud here yeah that's right that's how you say so here's something interesting in that I just went to the sword and shield expansion pass page on the website and they now see because I'm pretty sure when they announced that it was June 2020 but now it's share it says scheduled for release by the end of June 2020 so like that that was me think that it's gonna be quite late on I think they changed that with the with a slowpoke trailer array okay I think that's just a good like use of that's a good term to just give them by this as time as possible right they could like they could be like it's coming out June 30th you know so it's just then as much time with that June date it's just just the best way to give them as much time as possible although I guess just saying June 2020 would also give them the same amount of time but yeah I guess they're probably putting the focus on by the end of yeah to just give people the expectation it doesn't seem to have worked though was it the 15th the most people are assuming at this point because of the I am the mystery gifts so we're looking at just Friday's we have either June 5th June 12th June 19th and June 26 I was going oh that's right huh and yeah so the Meowth event I think starts on the 15th and then or now not the 15th I think it starts in the 11th or something goes until the night yeah yeah I think yeah I think ends on the 18th wasn't it was a day before oh right right maybe that could be the plan it's just they also have the option like you're saying earlier if they like get closer to that and realize something's not gonna work or they need to give it maybe another week they still have that like that option since they've said until you know by the end see if it comes out the 19th I'm gonna have a very busy couple of weeks cuz that's only a few days after summer and matter comes a oh it's gonna be so easy I think the 20th is also the wheedle day oh it is you're right yeah of course that means of course they're gonna do then because yeah because sergeant Schultz came out the day before November's which I think was Chimchar community sorry yeah yeah which Tyee they like to have their events all together talking about eventually right al events on events on events events everywhere yeah I'm actually hoping it's the 26 I didn't I don't want another community day slash game launched the same weekend I will yeah I think the end of June is fine I the next weekend goes into Independence Day for America which most people have that Friday off yeah I think that's all else also but good but I always like to think of whenever any announcement says a month I always just in my head I put it right to the last day of that month so that I'm not like I never hype myself up for any time before then and if it comes before then nice little surprise but yeah I would say last day of the month it's like when they say holiday 2020 or wherever you're like yeah that's coming out on Christmas Eve isn't it yeah all right well no Pokemon of the week will and Gregg out this week
