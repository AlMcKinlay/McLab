[Music] hmm [Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 434 episode of the pokemon podcast it's super effective i'm your host sbj with me is greg hello i am here for this spooky tacular pokemon event all the ghost types are out i have my sableye buddy skitting around getting me a whole lot of nothing i don't think the ghost type event started yet did it uh i okay here's the thing and i'm gonna this is what annoys me i get i get a banner notification saying hey pop into pokemon go and read about the ghost event so i do does the ghost event news show up absolutely doesn't so how does it send me the notification but not the actual news story will is here to explain that to you i have no explanation other than the news alerts in pokemon go are absolute trash and you probably are just behind a few days on news alerts so you haven't been hitting okay to view them so it got stuck on one and now you're behind for all time i think they can send a push notification without like needing to direct you to something it says ghost event read it says read in the news read the news in the app in the notification yeah but what i'm saying is somebody probably sent the push notification but the other person didn't send the article not the news button well get it together niantic or quit now frauds we got a show for you guys today we had an interview with pokey jungle last week so if you want to listen to that that is last week's episode i thought was really good we keep saying that we're going to meet up at some point but you know we haven't are they local yeah why didn't you invite them to lunch yesterday look i have been trying to get that to happen for two years now give me the phone number i'll um i'll i will use my persuasive techniques get on it very happy to not have laryngitis or at least not as yeah what was that about i don't know i'm not a doctor now with that attitude we got some details about the max rate battles from crown tundra which we were speculating about not last week but the week before so we'll get to that we also have a halloween event coming to pokemon go we also have a halloween event currently in pokemon masters we also have new eggs in pokemon go a bit of an episode yeah let's start with pokemon masters here this is off pokemon.com october 15th acerola in mimikyu and hilbert and mighty yenna in pokemon masters alright well this is the this is the 20 minutes where we talk about why these trainers have these pokemon well no i mean we know why acerola has mimicked you right now that's a given it's the hilbert mystery the hillbilly mystery is the mystery okay well let me let me read and then we can talk about the mystery i i'm very happy that this podcast has turned into a crime drama a costume a couple costume sink pairs have arrived in time for spooky season halloween is approaching you can bet that the isle uh island not nile island of pa passio is getting ready to celebrate from october 14th through november 1st pokemon masters ex players will find two festive five star sink pairs with ghost type ace rolla and mimikyu and dark type hilbert and maitiena not only are these pokemon trainers ready for battle with their partner pokemon they are dressed like their pokemon too and both of these trainers can become six star ex if uh you know in about two years you'll be able to get there with them and i think the mimikyu one is like shiny when it's six star ex which is kind of cool or her outfit is i think it's her outfit not though yeah mimikyu doesn't magically turn shiny but acerola's uh six star sync pair turns shiny i believe what is a what does a shiny mimic you look like it's like monochrome yeah it's just like gray black and white oh i want that yeah it looks good i am breeding well next the next one my next shiny hunt will be a mimikyu okay i don't want to ruin the okay so i went to dna and i said why is it why is it hilbert and mighty anna and not brendan and mighty anna cause that makes way more sense right uh for those that don't know the like puchienna is what you gotta fight off with your starter pokemon as brendan or may in in ruby and sapphire and i think emerald right emerald has the same opening too yep and their response was we know that pokemon masters is canon obviously it says on pokemon.com that it is made by published by the pokemon company etc etc so there's your boring answer uh so that translates to uh whatever i do what i want well i did ask basically the pokemon company decided if hilbert should have been with my deanna or dna did and they said that they both decided together sure [Laughter] okay but here's the here's the big question are both worth pulling on um i haven't seen i've heard i've actually heard that hilbert is the better of the two but i don't know if that's true probably the reason people are saying that is because there's already really good ghost type trainers in masters uh and i guess mimikyu could have either been ghost or fairy but they decided on ghost which i mean makes sense because it's a halloween event duh but uh i believe we don't have a lot of ferry right we only have um nina sylveon yeah and so three yeah i mean hilbert's pandering to somebody not me with somebody oh you know no i don't that's what i'm asking [Laughter] right now right in if it's pandering to you let us know the shift gears a little bit the this is just unfortunate timing and i am not one to defend niantic i think that's very best because i've been very clear on this show but they uh pokemon.com they added 12k eggs during a pandemic when they removed the walking bonus at the start of the month the timing is incredibly poor here also getting those 12k eggs is super frustrating yup why is it frustrating well here let me read the blog post we can talk about it yeah uh hatch a strange egg rescue shadow mewtwo and catch shiny shadow pokemon in pokemon go uh team rocket is causing more trouble in pokemon go and your eggs your eggs oh i get it it's like well they should not have hyphenated that terrible word yeah it's it's exactly but with eggs i was very confused for a minute from october 12th through october 19th you can help take town team rocket during this event i actually didn't know this event was limited yeah it's very limited during this time you can find a new type of pokemon egg called strange eggs for the first time in pokemon go strange eggs hatch into poison or dark type pokemon as well as pokemon that acquire either of those types through evolution such as larvaetar scraggy trubish vullabai if you're uh you know playing with some pokemon go players who are very bad at saying pokemon names because they've only played red and blue which is totally fine uh so velabi it's lullaby because it's lullaby so that's your easy way to remember there uh you can find strange eggs by defeating team rocket team go rocket and hatch eggs by walking 12 kilometers strange eggs will be available in pokemon go after the event ends so you don't have to worry you have to get your hands on one uh poison or dark type pokemon like spinarak houndhour poochie yenna gulpin stunky per loin and others will be appearing more frequently in the wild during the event be sure to take snapshots for surprises you will also begin uh gain access to a new special research story called in in it's interesting but they put the word egg in it again development completing the special research will lead you to a conference confrontation against giovanni himself defeat him in battle and you will have a chance to rescue shadow mewtwo i believe if you had a gofest ticket you will get a second one here during the event you will come across more pokestops that have been taken over by team go rocket you will encounter more team go rocket balloons it's like balloon city for the like the last like six months yeah the nefarious team go rocket grunts will frequently be partnered with shadow pokemon like diglett slowpoke sheldor aerodactyl hoppip and skarmory team go rocket leaders will be using different shadow pokemon including growlithe drowsy and omanite those three can be shiny if you're lucky oh it literally says that next sentence from uh and then there are new avatar themed items in the store uh okay so one you can find a strange egg by defeating a team go rocket leader leader claw cliff and sierra yeah not not so not just a regular grunt yeah so it has to be a leader yeah you have to have you have to be six grunts to get the leader which means you have to defeat grunts either in balloons are not spinning any stops because if you have a spot and then you spin the stop you get an egg and then you have to try to quickly hatch the egg when the walk bonus has been removed so then like you have and you can't get you can't just get rid of eggs you can't trash them yeah so you have to like time this so perfectly and hope that you get a leader and that leader gives you an egg it's super frustrating yeah and i got one egg and when it hatched i'm like that's it then there's a very easy answer to your conundrum which is buy a bunch of incubators so that you incubate all of your eggs at the same time and then you'll always have plenty of space yeah i'm not i'm not giving them money you're not about that life now i'm not about that life i'm not i'm not about that we were having this conversation in community today yesterday i am not spending money on expanding my storage because a home is coming and i refuse i think eggs are pretty lousy um okay so a couple things before i get to my my i do agree with greg with the with the egg stuff here but um what i want to say before we get to sidetracked is i'm i'm sure that a company well first off i'm sure that the pokemon company in niantic they have a timeline for things right they know when gen 6 is coming they probably roughly know when gen 7 is coming they probably know what the next couple communion days are right having a team rocket event during halloween with dark type pokemon and poison type pokemon and giovanni and shadow mewtwo kinda like doesn't seem out of the blue right it kind of lines up you know it's a couple months after go fest we know that after go fest they give us the opportunity to catch what people were able to catch so first they did victini waited a little bit now they did um the shadow mewtwo and stuff so uh i'm giving them the benefit of the doubt that they that the strange eggs thing was probably planned earlier in the year and this was all supposed to come together as like one thing i don't think that like mid pandemic they were like let's make trainers walk even more but also i mean i wonder if there's that decision of like should we not roll out this like new mechanic or should we what's the new mechanic that an egg can drop from a leader like there is nothing interesting about that mechanic that would suggest you can't just not do it like i guess the interesting thing is i'm thinking like them people are probably getting tired of team go rocket so we introduce new shadow pokemon we introduce them dropping eggs which maybe is fun for some people that like eggs uh and in those eggs there are pokemon that you've never had before like volabile i guess mechanically there's not something new here but they're giving you another reason to battle team go rocket they don't hatch a shadow pokemon though do they no no okay no and i also don't i i also tend to believe that there was probably in the pipeline we're going to start rolling back bonuses at the start of october which i think we talked about but no one knew that the pandemic was going to get worse now and then the time everybody knew that well the summer was pretty good for most countries that were not the united states yeah but everybody knows the flu gets worse yeah well everyone knows that there was gonna be a second wave everybody like you can't say that they didn't you know if if they're gonna speak out of one side of the mouth that they're closely watching the world and then out of the other side of the mouth they're like yeah but we're gonna release all this crap anyways like which isn't true either you aren't closely watching it or you are and you just don't care well i mean walking around outside isn't the worst thing you can do no it's not i mean it's but cold but well for the world up here in the majority of the country it's actually perfectly fine so i still stand by if they if they communicated that october 1st noticed better with the incense and i don't think people would have been as mad especially with the egg stuff well like reverting i think any time you can communicate appropriately and well people are less mad like at some point these companies are gonna learn like huh we get in trouble because we try to keep all these secrets and don't explain ourselves and then everybody's mad and we are keeping these secrets for no reason other than being secretive you know i i mean this is completely like side track somebody needs to research and investigate i blame apple for that yeah because they just spent all that time like we're not going to tell anybody anything and then they're gonna be so surprised and happy when they see what we got and like every other company is like oh we gotta follow what apple's doing and i'm like no just tell me what's going on dude yeah like let me like prepare my life around like if i've already invested in your product let me like be ready for the next thing i'm assuming they were listening though because they we had a half for how long it was like six months we had the half egg distance and then they gave us one fourth egg distance like five days after october first yeah maybe they're listening maybe they only care about people in australia where it's going to be summer now i will they're like the australians are getting out there they're getting outside nobody cares about the people in australia i like perth they're moms nobody likes perth now that's a fib right there come on no i i've hated the egg mechanic for a very long time back back like three years ago in pokemon go i was very naive i was buying incubators i remember like the rock type event and i bought all all these incubators and i was hatching nothing but kabutos and geodudes and i don't remember what was like the shiny that event it was very early on but i was like i swore off incubators i was like never again you incubators you this is my line i finally reached it but the times i played pokemon go uh which i was able to do three pokemon go streams on twitch i did two in austin and then i did one this past weekend in milwaukee the one fourth egg hatch distance whether it's on a 5k or a 10k or even the 12k it was awesome it felt good like it i and i didn't buy a single incubator i just used my free one and i think i hatched maybe like six or seven eggs in the four hours i played yesterday uh now the rewards were garbage i hatched four chicoritas in a row from 5k eggs and my 12k egg hatched to be a scraggy uh which i guess is better than the rubbish i don't know if it's better than the larva tar um i mean seeing as we had a lot we've had many larvitars appearing in the wild maybe this greg yeah didn't we have like a larvitar community day at one point so i got that and then my 7k eggs have i have literally had four alolan geodudes in a row well thanks for ruining pokemon of the week greg let me get back to my research but i i gosh that like the being able to hatch it that quickly and and not needing the worry of like i have all these eggs and then the only way for me to clear them is to buy them i love the 1 4 makes me like hatching eggs even though it's garbage because i'm not spending money they're hatching fast enough where like i feel like i'm i'm going through eggs like if it i i would love that to stay i know it wouldn't but it won't but now that we have so many eggs so again going back this is this is going back to your point earlier greg of like these getting these are hard to get because i can't have my pokeball plus on because if it was on it would auto spin stuff and then if it would auto spin stuff i would run the risk of getting an egg and the other problem was during community day i was completing the test cause it's like catch three charmander but then i was worried about spinning the stops of getting a new task because that would give me an egg and when we started pokemon go we only had the two the five and the ten but now we have the seven and now we have the twelve and we know once you receive the egg so this is why the eggs aren't considered loot boxes even though i think that european law will eventually make it to disclose rates because technically once you get the egg it's all you already know the game already knows what's in it so it's not like it's rolling a roulette wheel when you put it in the incubator when you get the egg the pokemon is already determined at that point when you put it in the incubator you are just seeing what it is and at this point why can't we just throw them away because that would solve a lot of problems like if i specifically want if i know that there's a spooky event coming up and the spooky pokemon are in 5k and i have a bunch of 10k that are probably fee bass but could be dino could be gibble could be uh lola mola i guess i know at least the pool that i'm throwing away from and it could be a shiny dino right like technically shiny dino isn't eggs i don't know that unless i hatch it but let me let me have that conflict of management let me go well i really want the spooky eggs and all i have is a bunch of 10k eggs i'm gonna risk throwing away the 10k eggs for the spooky eggs but what if you could pay to throw away those eggs well i mean that's what incubators are exactly i mean they just want to charge you to make you hatch them i think they're not gonna they're not gonna give you a way to not give them money at this point i i don't even care give me more eggs give me a 15 egg give me a 20k give me a 8k egg give me eggs with different pools but at least let me manage them you can by paying the money for incubators it's problem solved like that's the thing it they're not going to let you throw away eggs because of incubators buying incubators and that's part of what frustrates me about things like this where it again it's just showing you that they are wanting to charge you money but that wasn't that wasn't a problem until the 7k eggs right because prior to that you had no control of what you got from a pokestop you could get a ten you could get a two you could get a five you had no control over that except maybe there were certain events where they would be like they would say like 10k eggs are dropping more or 5k eggs dropping more but now they introduced they've introduced two things one is like well when i open gifts i get 7k eggs okay well i have two empty egg slots but i don't want 7k eggs so i guess i can't open any gifts today and now over the weekend where it's like i can't spin a pokestop even though i want more quests i uh because i'm worried about getting an egg but i also want to play like if you are going to introduce these mechanics you you you are now making me dance around your other mechanics to play your game and that's not fun well you mean you're dancing or i'm not paying them money really ultimately that's what you're dancing around i will pay i give them a dollar yesterday i will give the money if things are fun i am not against giving them money i just want things to be fun you're overthinking all of this that's what's destroying your fun just play it as it lies dude get what you get play with your play and just enjoy it 12k egg it was red whatever number two let's petition niantic to set up a subscription service where i spend like twenty dollars a month on my pokemon go subscription and i get 20 incubators a month how's about that no that's way more money that i pay for an mmo and it's not mmo worthy i still 20 bucks a month 20 10 months okay i don't i i 100 believe that there's a subscription service coming uh i mean we saw that they have a like a minor line in the code that a subscription service is coming that doesn't necessarily mean they'll implement it but if if there was a subscription service coming i bet it would be like 7.99 because they seem to really like that price for do you like that price point i don't know why um i bet it would be 7.99 and if it gave me one free permanent incubator for the subscription so then i got two permanent incubators i'd actually be really into that hush your mouth no they give us 10 incubators per month or 20 incubators per month that's only that's only like 30 eggs right well i mean that's fine but i would rather have a permanent than like 10 that expire after three uses each i think but you would pay 7.99 a month for an extra permanent incubator well i would assume it would come with more i'm just saying that is like the bare minimum give me the incubator but your bare minimum is still one incubator one permanent incubator and don't tell them what your bare minimum is because that's what they'll provide you right what is the least we can give for the money it goes away that is not permanent yeah i mean i guess sure permanent has a subscription no no i mean i want i want rate tickets i want storage i want an extra incubator i want like i don't think storage matters you already you get i mean your storage is permanent i don't think that matters yeah but more of it if i'm gonna pay that much a month no one is gonna need storage in like two months when when you dump this 700 chinese you have and well i just spent 400 coins on 100 more slots because the night before you could have cleared out your inventory but instead you were like that's too much work i'll spend the four dollars if there's one thing i'm not thinking about the night before i'm about to have a fantastic lunch with my friend greg it's storage in pokemon go exactly i was like what cologne am i gonna wear what is my cute little outfit gonna be am i gonna wear socks with my birkenstocks these are the important questions that needed to be addressed choices were made anyways i hatched a scraggy i hatched a larva tar and i probably threw it in the candy chipper bye bye there's some more pokemon go news about grubhub and stuff speaking of ticketed events uh but we're gonna take a break and then we'll be back when we come back we'll talk about the crown tundra this grub hub event and um yeah and this week the crown tundra comes out so we will be right back before we go on is shrek considered good or bad anymore i don't know i can't tell because when shrek came out i definitely like shrek and now i like kind of feel weird i like shrek i definitely like shrek i like shrek i definitely like shrek ally trek i can't tell if people actually like or dislike shrek [Music] i definitely like shrek [Music] we are back niantic has done two updates to mega evolution uh the first one is that when you mega evolve a pokemon it will last per i think these are permanent changes it will work say that now and then they'll be like we looked at those and changed them back we accidentally typoed on our website when you mega evolve a pokemon it will last eight hours instead of four hours again i don't know if that single chain makes anyone feel better [Laughter] the second change is the cap for mega energy has increased from a thousand to two thousand that's just how much you can hold so there were there have been um some people that are very into mega evolution and they hit the candy cap fairly quickly so they have doubled the cap um i don't think i'm that close i think i have the most i have is charizard i think i have like maybe 700 charizard mega candy wow i had 120 i have 300 i think for charizard and that's the most that i have there's not like a good way to like you can't just like search the word mega to like see which pokemon you have mega evolved oh i have 900 charizard candy dang i have mega evolved zero so that's a very easy number for me to look up well anyways those changes happen uh the other thing in pokemon go before we move topics here is there is a pokemon go special weekend presented by grubhub i don't know do people like grubhub uh i used to use them all the time in dc i they are my they are my last choice if i'm going to order food what's your first choice ubereats bite squad bites i think i think i think grubhub owns by bite squad they pretty much bought every other food delivery online company so yeah no i mean bite squad has its own it is it's definitely its own thing i don't get delivery because it's a two mile walk from my apartment to the front door of the building so [Laughter] yeah it is a bit of a hike trainers we're excited to announce we're partnering with our friends at grubhub to give trainers in the united states the opportunity to take part in an inclusive event trainers will be able to participate in a special weekend don't miss your chance special weekend event presented by grubhub starting today october 15th in the united states trainers can sign up to be part of a special weekend trainers who submit their emails here and join grubhub plus the membership offering a

and this event because this is the only time it's three hours but if you are interested this is what you'll get you'll get time to research it you'll earn three incense a star piece a hundred mega charizard candy as well as encounters with chansey spoink bronzor gibbel and sawaddle the following pokemon will be attracted to incense during the event bulbasaur charizard squirt what bulbasaur charizard squirtle pikachu unknown g unknown h stabilize patret mincino and ferracid if you're lucky you may encounter a shiny ferrara seed please note that shiny unknown will not be appearing during this event i think this is the first time they've come out and said like hey these pokemon are specifically not shiny which is good first time i can recall yeah yeah because there might have been somebody who would want only the shiny unknown from this but they can't be your incense will be will last for one hour so there's some you get a ticket by signing up before october 28th on the um page you will receive a email from grubhub within 48 hours i have this email i can read you what it says if you're new to grubhub plus sign up for the grubhub plus trial using the link in the email and the following prompts special weekend tickets will be sent out on november 4th via the email from grubhub to see if you qualify uh they are for new and current grubhub plus members trainers uh who are new to grubhub must join the using the link in the email described above they will receive their 14 day free trial i will say as somebody who's gone through most of this progress you do have to give them your credit card if you do forget to cancel after 14 days it's 10 bucks 9.99 trainers who are currently grub club grub club grub hub plus members must submit their email address on the special weekend event page by october 28th in order to register tickets will be sent out november 4th so two emails i'm sure this is gonna get a lot of questions your first email is to sign up for grubhub plus free trial the second email will be sent out november 4th for your ticket to go um you can only redeem one ticket per account of course only available in the us so there was some clarification from niantic here even though the free trial will end before november 4th if you sign up for the free trial and you cancel like a day later you will still get the ticket you don't have to have an active grubhub subscription to get the ticket you just have to sign up for the free trial so this event costs no money unless you forget to cancel after 14 days then it does cost money and grubhub wins there i guess grubhub wins no matter what because they get your email so we're all the we're all the losers in this in this case now grubhub's pretty good you grabbed melvin nah no care enough you don't want the g's or the h's or the malwales or i the it i had a shiny maw while i gave it to a friend of mine probably a mistake honestly definitely it's not like the shiny rayquaza i gave away that became lucky it wasn't shiny but we didn't do a lucky trade yesterday yep i no i don't first of all i don't know where i'm gonna be on november 8th exactly it's so far in the future it's a sunday which is like recording day but also there's nothing in this that i'm super excited about like haven't g and h been out before yeah yeah so chicago would have been one for h and gg yes that's true i mean so there's nothing in here that i'm super super super excited about doesn't incense incense act is i thought the incense time was staying at an hour anyways yeah i mean but that's like every 20 days niantic extends that so it's just saying like if for whatever reason they don't keep the incense for an hour these will be an hour well my incense yesterday was for three hours during yeah that's coming so i think they're specifically saying hey you don't get community day incense for this event that makes sense i like uh how are they gonna run out of tickets for a virtual event um do you think they just say while supplies last and make people sign up sooner than later probably just that absolutely absolutely they do because what do they i mean grove hub is not like well we only want 100 new people to sign up no more no less no more maybe they do honestly because they don't get the i feel like their problems they don't have enough drivers yeah i don't know you know what's really funny is if you were to listen to the podcast like four years ago when pokemon go came out we were we were because when when pokemon go came out they had the deal with sprint right yeah and then and then the deal was starbucks they had to deal with starbucks and the starbucks deal was only like two months in the us and it was it was it was like every starbucks was a pokestop and if you go into starbucks you could ask for a drink that every barista in the world hated to make um everybody hated to drink because i heard it was bad yeah it wasn't great um and then all the sprints were like defaults gyms and then they were all like default ex raids or whatever and they this i remember sprint giving out the like the the trainer badges of yeah that you could like glue to your denim jacket yeah and at the time we were all like well this is this is pokemon go they're just gonna do event after event after event with different companies and then the sprint deal ended and then the starbucks deal ended and it felt like they didn't do anything well i mean they did a lot of strange things like there have been a number of deals like we just talked about the the weird backpack fashion night yeah they did the backpack they've done a bunch of different weird things and all the starbucks are still gyms in my area yeah i just like this seems like this grubhub event seems like the thing they should have been doing after like ever since the sprint stuff well just nobody plays pokemon go anymore so companies lost interest yeah that's that has to be it i they i mean they they have had events with um both mcdonald's and 7-eleven in japan i think there's like there was a 7-eleven event in mexico specifically i think this ferrara seed something to do with ferracid in mexico for 7-eleven or something what are you just making that up yeah no yeah i'm making it all up no but they've had events in other countries specifically japan taiwan's had a couple events right they had the like well those were like festival events i i i would say if this was tied to like food pokemon i would probably be more inclined but you literally did not say you know vanillish once or even a light once right give me like make that the special unique pokemon and i'd be like all over it i'm down but nobody's gonna eat a pharah seed you chip a tooth yeah but it's not a worldwide event so they're kind of like stuck who cares about the rest of the world so i certainly don't the grubhub event is sunday the 8th yeah the mexican event is november 7th the saturday before yeah it's first specifically for mexico right right and that was through 7-eleven correct but here's the part that's getting me right now in order to gain access to this event you need to obtain a ticket by spending more than 150 dollars in 7-eleven stores in mexico is that like how it says dollars yeah i was gonna say is it dollars or pesos it says dollars here so i don't know if this is translation error but i'm struggling to think how much is 150 pesos not much it has to be pasted i don't know like back when i lived in dc i used to go to 7-eleven every morning and i'd get like two sodas and a coffee and that was like ten dollars i could like in 17 days i would have done it so 150 pesos is about seven dollars and ten cents so it's gotta be it has to be pesos it has to be pesos this has to be a choice yeah because it's the 799 mark i am staring at this struggling to figure out how i spend and fifty dollars you don't know what they sell it's actually seven eleven they could they could they could have they could have like tires at their 7-elevens no that's not how 7-eleven works they have slushies slurpees i don't know what they're called they have slurpees and slim jims they've got doughnuts they've got the simpsons style doughnuts at the 7-eleven and uh cigarettes it has to be pesos it has to be i mean where where are you reading this i am reading this on pokemongohub.net yes once it becomes a dotnet that's us yeah it's super sus i mean i would i don't read spanish so i could go to the 7-eleven page but i have no idea what it's telling me uh oh link me wait hablo espanol i don't know if this is real spanish what do you [Music] upside down exclamation and right side up exclamation just like you do in in spanish it's 150 pesos they use the dollar sign but yes it says buy 150 pesos or more in their stores register your ticket in the app and you gotta get one like one slushy there and you're good you will get an email access code on the 26th of october isn't it slurpees at 7-eleven yeah i think so isn't slurpee just a slushie yes uh no one is slush and the other is slurped so there's clearly a difference okay to make it easy you get your big gulp at the side oh yeah i need 74 ounces of diet coke to get me through my day this is off pokejungle.net details about catching a legendary pokemon and dynamaxx adventure some small news regarding catching legendary pokemon in pokemon sword and shield dlc the crown tundra has been released each legendary pokemon can only be caught by players once but they will have a 100 catch rate this means any type of pokeball can be used without fear while many players are still wondering whether or not these legendaries can appear in shiny form we we do not have the answer for that um they do link a tweet to at play pokemon which is an official pokemon twitter who for some reason tweeted this at like 10 o'clock last night uh which says we've discovered new information about dynamaxx pokemon and the crown tundra while you can only catch one of each legendary pokemon found in dynamics adventures you're guaranteed to catch them if you defeat them um and then it links to the sword shield.pokemon.com page this well i guess they probably tweeted it like late last night because it originally the news broke from a japanese tv show which i think had the japanese voice actor for pikachu i can't remember her name i think it was her that's at least what twitter was saying i don't know if you can trust twitter but so it was it was on the tv show and then several hours later the english twitter tweeted it so i guess that kind of clears up some of the things we talked about last time so well i can only catch one of each legendary pokemon that see that doesn't necessarily so is that the host only or yeah yeah that's not answered yep that's not answered we do get the answer of well it would suck to go through five dynamax and then get to the legendary and then fail and then your friends catch it and you'd be like oh well you know oh it's dinner time i'm super sorry thanks for helping me but good luck with getting that giratina next time so it answers that question uh the catching question was answered of like again getting to the end throwing a premier ball because you only get one ball and then it fails that's answered chinese not answered i mean i bet they lost those are good that they're shiny locked right yeah well who knows i mean they didn't lock wormholes but also you could just save in front of the wormhole you have no way to save in front of this as far as we know right i don't think i'm pretty sure there was i'm pretty sure well you save before you go into the den and then you do the five unless it like lets you save after but but since you have a squad of people right going in with you it's like are you all hitting soft reset at the same time i i say they don't shiny lock it and it's just like it's actually magical to get a shiny again okay so even if they didn't shiny lock it who's doing this who's being like like this is a serious question who you're doing i am not doing this i respect my time way too much if even if they don't shiny lock it who's going through like three to five raid battles and then getting to the end and being like well not shiny and then resetting and then like if you could maybe re keep all the rewards sure because at least you're getting rewarded for the five raid battles and you're stocking up on candy wait wait wait here's something that we haven't considered what if you have the option to not catch like you go through you get to the end and you defeat it and then it says do you want to catch this pokemon or pass this time i mean because you have the option to not catch now that's true so i mean i know what your twitch mondays are going to be no no no no yeah you know how many people come in my chat and they're like are you going to suffer set and so did moon for apopleo no because i respect my time i'm not going to waste 14 minutes yeah listening to sun and moon dialogue to get apopleo to start some weird adventure i i that is i already hate software setting i already think it's a bad way to interact with a video game i was i soft resetted the uh in let's go pikachu let's go eevee for the articuno the zapdos and the mall trace because the at least there was horrible it was like semi-fast and everyone was like super into it but mostly because it was like semi-fast if they had an option in that game to just like run away from the articuno while you stood in front of it i would have probably done that instead i have zero desire to go through a bunch of dialogue to like maybe check if a popular like i'd i would rather masuda and i kind of hate masuda at this point too not the man the method uh you say that now but you have you have broken down many of your former taboos that's true i i like max ray battles because i think they're fine i don't want to do five to get shiny pokemon if i really needed shiny giratina i'll i'll go back to wormhole like if i really need to software set guarana for more i'll do that i don't want to rely on rented pokemon i don't rely on four other people i want dynamax adventure to be fun more than like i want a possible one in 4 000 shiny at the end of it where did you trust peop trust issues with other people helping you come from steve twitch i have zero problems in final fantasy 14 finding people who will be willing to run a dungeon 15 times to get a horse who wants to spend 20 minutes for one shiny check everybody in your twitch chat that is not true at least four at least three people yeah at least three two one that is probably accurate at least three any time you would easily get three people each time to get into a raid den with you just because people would want to join my raids doesn't mean those same people want to do five raids with me for a single chance of shiny check but you could you would be able to switch it up every time you could do 10 runs with three separate people every time and still not run out of people in your chat that wanted to go with you yeah i mean i can i can do raids all night on monday with with whatever raids have existed in sword and shield i have yet to find a shiny that way because the shiny charm doesn't affect raids it's one in four thousand and also i know that each of those raids even if we're playing efficiently and spamming the correct type effectiveness button it still takes the two minutes to line everyone up get everyone in start the raid wait for the dynamax animation to happen wait for the two uh damage checks to happen that whole process still takes like seven minutes of pokemon what else are you doing uh i could be i could be i could be doing stuff you don't know me i could be getting ribbons on my pokemon i could be climbing the competitive ladder i could be i could be cooking weird pokemon foods i could be trying to get a shiner through i could be doing a lot of things i like raids and i like shiny pokemon that just because i like shiny popplio doesn't mean i want to sit through five minutes of dialogue for one shiny check and and one raid is already longer than five minutes of dialogue in sun and moon it's seven minutes also is are we just not assuming the entire raid is shiny locked because if you're walking through and you're doing five raids they already said only one person can catch it and then add it to your team and those are rental pokemon so aren't those going to be locked well they didn't say only one person can catch it they said one person can add it to their team that's they didn't say anything about catching but yeah we don't i guess we don't know if the five pokemon before the i don't know i keep saying five did they confirm most five no it's a number x number two to 20 i don't know we don't know if i'm assuming the ones you catch you do add to your team slash you do just keep them well that's an assumption it may be incorrect it's kind of weird to catch a pokemon that you wouldn't you like you start you start with a rental everything is a rental until the final one that you catch i mean it's it's clear that in this game they put their foot down on software setting they did with the starters they did with type null they did with eternitis zashian zamazenta but you're right you could get to the end you could get the rewards for everything you did and then you could just run away but for all the people being like i hope you can shiny huh did they forget about the first part of the mission no that's the fun part okay we'll see if it's fun i hope it's fun but it's gonna be fun because things that you get to do with your friends are fun well unless you're steve because steve doesn't trust friends he just wants to sit there alone and just rely on himself no what what yeah any game with friends is fun that's why people like mario party because they don't they're not playing it by themselves to get three computers i mean if they if they do decide to lock these pokemon is the statement just go back to older games if you want to shine these i guess this would be or go to pokemon go they are in the business of selling us old games it's not a secret i'm pretty sure the reason that so many people bought crystal was because you could get a celebi in it well and also because it's a fun game to play that's up for debate i want to do dynamics adventure i just i do too i have zero interest in going through it multiple times for the hope of a one in four thousand chance for shiny landorus so this is just a personal issue for you that you don't want it to have shining capability because you feel that would imbu imply imbue some obligation upon you to start doing shiny hunting that way if it if it can be shiny that's cool i'm i'm not to do it though i'll i'll go through i'll catch the landorus and that'll be it fine uh-huh he says that now i that exactly that's exactly my thought i think the thing about um here's here's the difference uh where we're like we the popplio is like five minutes and it's like a lot of in in like sun and moon right if you want to reset for popularity at the beginning it's like five minutes there is like some paying attention to that because i think there's like two questions you have to answer or maybe i'm thinking of x and y and x and y when you're like resetting for chespin or whatever they ask you if you want to be like big p or little d or something like that it's like no both these nicknames are terrible i don't want to be little d or big p but they ask you like two questions whereas like when you're software setting for like wormhole pokemon like ferramosa in the ultra wormhole or your software setting for articuno and let's go pikachu let's go eevee your mind is so not needed for that because it is all it takes what you did for the other one i don't think we have any more details for crown tundra i think that's it that's it i mean will have some next week yeah we'll definitely have some next week the only reason that they came out with this is obviously they listened to this program heard our like hours worth of speculation and they're like oh geez we've got to address this [Laughter] they gotta let us know i have a pokemon go question okay before we get too deep okay okay so the main way i play pokemon go is sending gifts and receiving gifts i think we've established that at this point in time you don't send me gifts i do on the saturdays and sundays that's when you need to be on the lookout for those i've been low gift lately because it's gotten a little cold for bike riding but we're working on that anyways recently the gifts i can't tell if it's all gifts or only some gifts have a pikachu head on them which is new yes what does that mean it means it has a sticker that's what i thought but then somebody else said no that's not what it means i mean it doesn't put stickers on their gifts i sometimes forget great i try but it takes like nothing to hit one button and hit and send a little thank you thank you thank you there are times when i mean to hit the sticker button and i accidentally hit the send button because i'm not paying close enough attention that sounds like shiny hunting you would know it's your career i'm very just i am why do people say this i have shiny hunted like four pokemon and sword and shield game's been out for a year uh because you were shiny hunting for like two years and other games before that wait if you don't shiny hunt what is your career oh my gosh i play pokemon but what are you doing in the i mean there hasn't been a new there hasn't been a new pokemon game in a year what are you even doing it's like it's like some people who come into my stream and they're like wow you battle steve i have made it to master rank every single month since these games have come out you have no you have previously on this very podcast talked about how you did not like battling i am not surprised people are surprised that you are battling now next he's going to start playing pokemon ptcgo i've played pokemon pcg on the stream i have like 500 hours of twitch streaming ptc yeah you don't have your spooky decks anymore for halloween you just threw that in the dustbin look greg do you think i want to be the kmart of streamers no i adapt and i change you know who didn't adapt and change k-mart you know who's out of business k-mart are they really out of business no they are still selling blue icees the blue light special did not save them what okay if you're not the kmart what are you i don't know are you the trader joe's of twitch uh i'm not that good off off brand cheap stuff actually i'll take it back i would love the uber from uh changing my twitch description to the trader joes of twitch just call yourself trader steves welcome to trader steve's twitch stream uh would you like some organic pikachus i sell chips you've never heard of i sell chips and wine what more do you need in these chicken times if anyone can send me an alert when trader joe's has the bacon-esque popcorn back again please i have missed that so much trader joe's my cousin seriously works at trader joe's your cousin trader steve yeah no my cousin uh trader david trader joe's has the best apple cider in the world i mean i have no reason not to go to trader joe's except it used to be that there wasn't one near me but there is one now it's in downtown minneapolis but parking down there is bad so i pretend that there isn't one near well that's why you ride your bike there we've talked about how my bike is in no shape to be written well you gotta have a basket on your bike okay i got a backpack that too i mean how much do you need to be able to carry two bags of bacon-esque popcorn i mean i could ask my cousin if they think they're gonna get back at some point dude could please get on it i'm ready to send it on twitch i mean it twitch twitter i'll check i'll send it to him i'll i'll tag you appreciate it okay this is from andrew in our attic channel uh they have some japanese stuff uh they say the physical giveaway this year at the pokemon movie in japan is going to be a trading card that's not new first time in a while though i think here's the interesting the card is of a human title character of coco uh that's the little boy so unless there's a bit of a twist in the movie that like tarzan like character is really a pokemon in disguise you will be able to battle with a human in the tcg it knows call a forest which lets you search for a grass type pokemon in your deck show it to your opponent and then shuffle your hand and it will know tarzan kick which is a coin toss move 120 damage or nothing three millions of the three million copies of the cards will be produced to be given away i know this shouldn't bother me as much as it does what that the boy is a card yeah like the and not a supporter yeah it's not a supporter it's like a human in their kicking pokemon what happened tarzan actually like is there a twist in tarzan where he's actually a monkey no so the twist is that he's actually rich what really yeah oh yeah the family he was noble yeah it was lost over the jungle like it's it's a really disgusting stereotype of the noble savage yeah i guess i mean if this is the first like non-pokemon attacking thing i guess that's something bothers me i mean there were fossils in the tcg where the fossil would have like 10 hp that's technically just the issue is that it's a human right a human can't be in a pokeball so how do you throw it out to how do you put it in battle how do you how do you be like i have stuffed this child into a pokeball and now it's gonna come out and kick you for 120 that's a pretty good kick well yeah all or nothing though the other thing i want to bring up real quick this is our last bit of news um not a spoiler i don't want anyone to worry i i'm gonna bring up a date of mine but i'm not gonna spoil anything for you i promise crown tundra is so close i wouldn't i wouldn't do this to you there was a data mine though that came out several months ago actually at the same time the armor vial came out and a bunch of data miners saw that there was the framework for the crown tundra so they were able to see the island they were able to see uh the where you could fly to on the island and they were able to see a list of pokemon okay i'm gonna spoil those list of pokemon a lot of legendaries though as we know from the trailers with all of them they've already told us it's all of the legendaries i know not a lot of them all of them all of them spoilers specifically all of them um but in that in the data mine i had a list of all the pokemon that were there uh like altaria nidoking again these pokemon that were shown in the trailer on the tv show we talked about which talked about the dynamax stuff they confirmed that stantler was in the crown tundra which i guess kind of makes sense reindeer snow but here's the twist stantler was not in the data mine interesting either the data mine was wrong well i guess technically the demand of mine is wrong sailing or they've added pokemon since the initial update because right like when they sent out the isle of armor that was just a framework of the crown tundra attached and they haven't they have they've updated the isle of armor they've fixed the hacked raids or whatever but they haven't updated it since even though the data mine shows a hundred or some new pokemon like 30 of those being legendaries stantler was not in the data mine so that's just something interesting to think about as we go into crown tundra so are you saying that there still could be some surprises no what i'm saying is stanler's a legendary pokemon oh oh true i mean you did say all legendaries all of the legendaries all 890 of them every pokemon is legendary yeah well yeah i i i mean i hope crown tundra has some surprises the surprise was friendship the entire time very fair question of the week all right it was the question the question of the week oh i understand very very oriented thank you wow i understood that this is from robert what advice would you give to somebody who is meeting you for the first time in this community is meeting me that difficult uh yes one of us only speaks the truth one of us only speaks lies you can ask one question [Laughter] i think i'm i think i'm remarkably easy to meet what you two you can do can fill in the cop blanks on that one but i think i'm quite friendly well i would put it this way greg you and i are incredibly friendly and engaged especially in the channels of which we have interest the other person on this program good luck if you can catch him he's just as rare as a shiny pokemon i am so easy to get a hold of what are you talking about uh yeah like they're on his crown you don't go into the channels as much as greg and i do and actually have conversations and discussions and stuff we're just regular folks like everybody else i like music sometimes when i talk in slack i like kill the momentum everybody kills the momentum the memento the momentum in slack is remarkably hard to keep up with and it's very easy to stop i talk i mean i talk in the pokemon go i talk to the masters i mostly post involved those are channels i don't go to yeah i i mostly posting gold i think i was kicked out of gold i mean it's that looks like i didn't i think like first of all like let us know ahead of time i mean if we're at a con or something like when they ever come back often we have things to do there so if you're just catching us at a con and we are going somewhere it's usually because we have some like we just don't have a lot of time but if you can say hey i've got this free time the easiest way is through twitter to say hey i'm going to be here when can we meet up for a chunk of time like any in a sort of con situation like i know especially at gen con i have panels that i'm supposed to be on i have things that i'm supposed to do um so i need to be able to schedule people in otherwise i always feel like if i'm just running into you if i have somewhere to go i i don't want to be rude but also i have a commitment that i have to meet so it's easier if you schedule some sort of time or meeting time or say i'm going to be here for the next whatever i would love to see you and then that can give a structure and i can not feel like i'm watching the clock or you know i'm trying to rush through a conversation because i generally do want to meet pretty much everybody but there are times especially where i tend to meet a lot of people where i am on a schedule and i have to do something and i don't want to shortchange your time i don't want you to feel like we're rushed i would agree with that also uh two pieces of advice um bring a vanguard deck because i cannot step down from a vanguard challenge um or if you play commander it's not that hard to twist greg and mike's arm to throw in for a game of commander yeah well well throw down person commander but also it's like i know like a good portion of our listeners are tend to be more introverted but we we generally are pretty outgoing people and we we're not mean people so like you can come and say hi to us and we're not going to be like get out of my face well he'll just walk by and ignore you but like greg and i will be like come give me a hug [Laughter] when they said that one of us lies they mean the one as in the two of them in a group well because greg and i are basically the same person yes so according to internet we are yes kind of piggyback off greg's thing this is the thing i hate about conventions i'm just going to lay it out here and we've had this happen at like like the dc worlds we've had it happen at like pax uh that we've been to where like a lot of and this is not specific to our community this is like any community where a bunch of people meet up and then there's like this obligation where we all have to do something together specifically maybe like eat together and it is the biggest pain in the world because one there's always like two people in the group of like 10 people that are like oh i can't eat that kind of food or two it's impossible to get a table for like a group of like four or more anywhere and there's like this weird thing where like i don't care like if if if it was like if you guys if you guys want to go somewhere and if it's sushi and something that do it cool like i i don't need to be a part of this or we don't have to like switch it to what i need to do and then all of a sudden there's like 13 people trying to get a table at like a burger place it just makes things really complicated at like conventions when when people like don't want to separate or don't they feel like somebody will be offended if like half the group was like hey we're just gonna get tacos i'd be like yeah do it because uh you'll probably get the tacos 30 times faster than us trying to negotiate a restaurant that can serve everyone i mean it's hard to get past the fact that people like having meals like that's a thing that's like a that is like a societal thing eating together is a is a strong bonding thing but it is sometimes incredibly difficult to do but it's not terrible if you can plan it beforehand like we did it for go fest we did it where we like um rented like a fourth of a restaurant but like we did in the last one where y'all met and irene and i went s went and saw the show yeah but that was yeah that wasn't as big as a group of though yeah it wasn't like like for dc worlds i think one of the nights we had 14 people for dinner or something weird yeah and it's like a lot spread out over a bunch of tables yeah i mean i also say dinner so meals like that where it's 14 people are probably not the interaction that you're wanting right i would rather be like hey i'll get lunch with you tomorrow i'll get breakfast with you the next day i'll get lunch with you the following day because it just makes it like easier to do um and more personal personable i will say that if you're going to come up and approach one of us but you don't say where you know us from that's an awkward conversation like i don't know why you're coming why why well who are why are you here this is the problem i have with people sending me random offenders requests in pokemon go like if you don't tell me like who who you are what your username is like i i am probably not going to accept that because i have no clue who you are well i've had the problem where people like started to talk to me and i thought they knew me because of this podcast and they actually knew me because of a different podcast and didn't even know i had anything to do with pokemon at all yeah like just let us let's know where you know us from we do multiple projects for multiple reasons like i'm having that like there are people who now only know me because i wrote a role playing game so like just let me know what what avenue of interest brought you to my doorstep so i can have that conversation with you uh the other thing again is not specific to our community but i don't mind hugs but there are definitely people that don't want to be touched so just don't assume that like oh i'm getting to meet you i get to hug you i don't personally mind yeah just ask i'm a hugger but that's like that's my limit like i'll hug but i am not like a super touchy person at all not physically but he's super touchy emotionally you get set back in a minute uh i forgot this last bit of news uh on sunday october 25th from 8 to 10 there will be a drift ghost type event a drift loon in the wild shiny drift loom time to research extra xp when doing nice great or excellent curve throws uh so that'll be from 8 am to 10 p.m i think it'll probably be similar to like the meowth event uh because there will be the exclusive time to research i don't know how many people will be playing since uh it is two days after crown tundra but maybe you don't care about count crown tundra and you care more about pokemon go you know you got something to do that weekend i'll probably do the research it shouldn't be too hard oh you need a break from sitting in front of the tv yeah hopefully the weekend video game it's not like 30 degrees out though i mean are you going to be doing are we doing max right friday or what's the um i don't know what the game plan is for me for crown tundra i guess i probably want to start off just exploring the area i think i want to trade monday yeah yeah for sure max raid's on monday but i want to i think i want to complete the pokedex at first i know i could just transfer all of them in from home but that's no fun i want to catch catch from catch everything from scratch oh i guess the legends though throw a wrench in that because they'll count for the pokedex okay i don't mind moving the legends in because then it doesn't force me to grind out them unless they don't give you anything for completing the pokedex that'll be a bummer maybe you'll get socks in pokemon go wait did isle of armor give you something for completing the isle of armor pokedex yeah you get the uh you get the crown that you can wear and then you get the uh mark charm which increases the chance of getting marks on pokemon ugh i guess i gotta start playing isle of armor again can wear that cool crown i ain't changing my clothes pokemon of the week oh are we here already all right last week's pokemon it was super easy it's a fruit it starts with b and it's not one that you would typically find in uh especially the united states the first time i ever encountered one i was in uh the middle east i was in qatar staying in the four seasons hotel and every thursday night they used to give me a nice tray of sweet things to eat and this was included i bit into it not realizing that the rind is basically wood and you have to kind of cut it in half to actually get to the fruit part which pokemon is it it's bonsai i mean that does start with b he does i mean i was expecting you to say banana uh aren't you glad i didn't say today is the trophies uh it's bone sweet bound sweet yes based on the mangosteen i did not realize that the shiny uh was had the purple top that's super cute i never look at the shinies until you mention them i wanted a sarina shiny because i like it but i didn't realize that its little top is purple oh man serena is absolutely one of my favorite pokemon i think like i played through ultra moon because of uh queen's majesty is such a great move or ability i also love that doesn't serene only evolve if uh certainly no stop stop and that one other things it's such a good little thing nice little like it's appealing to somebody queenly majesty that is such a great move i mean ability why are you keep saying move great ability it just like gets right there in front of uh who's the water bug annoying dude jupiter no is that cersket no well what are the water bugs you want the bad guy from ultramoon jupiter no that is a water bug it's true uh bond sweep may be based on a purple mangosteen mangosteens come in other colors i guess i mean it's really tasty if you can find yourself a mangosteen number one don't bite into it to get the actual fruit out and number two enjoy it i have always been interested in trying one but again i don't i can't get them here easily and i've not like sought them out what is the is there no opposite line to this because this line is 100 female usually there's a 100 male line to compliment it i don't think there was one in sun and moon i don't think so interesting all right this week's pokemon which greg has already ruined i didn't but not really he just ruined what i wrote oh all right here we go yesterday during pokemon go char cha cha community day i was checking for shinies when i noticed i was being invited to a remote raid by nathan in indianapolis curious to whether this would be a sought after mega evolution or giratina i opened the raid and was immediately disappointed why would someone invite me to a remote raid for that pokemon i asked greg isn't it available in the wild i think you can get it in eggs greg said all i have gotten and eggs for the past two weeks is and i got another one today i entered the remote raid anyways and even though this pokemon is the first in its evolutionary line appearing in a one-star raid i was still surprised at how quickly it was defeated so quickly in fact its hp bar still showed half health even though it had been fainted this fighting type pokemon one of unova's finest would love to help you build your home and shares its name with the non-held item that it holds there you go that's your pokemon of the week tale all right well we will be back next week with the crown chandra coverage on monday there will be no story spoilers but we will probably talk about the island we'll probably talk about clothes max raids uh hopefully there's like a new feature like the the battle ready dude that appeared in the tower for isle of armor so we'll talk about that uh i'm sure somebody will figure out how to break the max raid adventures and we'll probably end up talking about that so very very excited i will be streaming the crown tundra on twitch from 12 p.m to 12 a.m central time to do a 12-hour stream on friday it will come out in the u.s on thursday evening and then it will come out in japan in the uk australia on friday it should be a worldwide release that's why time zones so that's that's the plan twitch.tv slash pkmncast there were some new pikachus given out uh i think there's only one pikachu left uh to be distributed distributed as of this recording they're all good until november 30th if you're looking for those codes i've posted them both on twitter and on instagram twitter.com pkmencast instagram.com pkmencast we're still doing uh new youtube videos mondays the podcast wednesday our twitch highlights and friday is either twitch highlights or exclusive videos because i was traveling this week this last friday was uh pokemon masters polls for the holiday sink pairs for acerola and hilbert so uh youtube.com pkmencast and if you're looking for people to do dynamaxx raids with uh when the crowntunder
