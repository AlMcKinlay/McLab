[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 270 fifth episode of the Pokemon podcast it's super effective I'm your host SBJ and with me today I have Micah hello I'm actually looking at you carve it up the wrong pot can you find us on poplar also have will I'm really disturbed because mike is wearing an AJ style shirt and even though I don't care for wrestling I certainly hate AJ Styles good old it is you just you just did that to offend me yeah there yeah wait I'm not even gonna finally we have Irene hi there I am here I have arrived we're all here in my house my house my house [Music] in the middle of the streets yeah plural streets yeah what kind of house is this Motorhome it's a long house that actually is a long house I guess a Motorhome no no no alright a trailer okay we're already off course you got a special episode for you guys so I'll just break it down there's gonna be no news no Pokemon the week and we're just gonna talk about Pokemon go fest so I don't know how long we're going to talk about that but that's gonna be the whole episode we're all it is the morning after Pokemon go fest Irene is still in her pajamas will is still in now this is literally the clothes I'm wearing okay we're gonna talk about Pokemon go fast if you didn't go to Pokemon go fast if you don't care about Pokemon go I would advise you not to turn off this episode do not change to another channel oh they will assuredly be entertained yeah even if you don't care even if you're not the biggest Pokemon go player I think it's a point important to note that this is still a Pokemon event that was clearly the Pokemon company is very involved in Pokemon go and they care about its success and how it does and how it reflects or that company this was kind of pokemons summer thing and I believe they're not talking about ultrasound and ultramoon because of all the pokemon ghost stuff and then now that this is dying down we will get ultrasound and all from and stuff but this is still important for Pokemon as a whole so I think it's important to talk about with that being said I have a bunch of tweets that I barely remember the day yesterday but I'm looking at the tweets and now I do remember myself and Irene went Myka and your wife went correct my mother was there who's probably spent more time with you and Becky yes we used the patreon money to fly will out so will was was here he arrived and I'm still here second time in Chicago ah that was yes my second time in Chicago was it better than the first hmm I don't want to ruin it for people I'm not gonna say hi I guess I guess I'll start because I I read and I got there before everyone else so truly we would no no no no I I mean in Chicago I was there at 7 a.m. yeah but you weren't at the event you were off getting breakfast that's true that's true okay okay well actually before before we start we'll start with Myka what was he what was your expectations of this event on the way down so my wife Becky plays Pokemon go with me but she plays it with me as a means to do something with me wala did she does any time yes she won't typically play on her own unless she's playing with me the only time she's ever gone out and played pokemon go on her own was the day before pokemon go fest when she wanted to get to level 20 just as like a milestone so she went out walked the dog all over and tried to solo a four star raid because she didn't know how raids worked perfect she kind of came because she wanted to see everybody she wanted to spend time with me and on the way down in the car I was thanking her and I said I'm very grateful that you're coming even though I know this is something you typically wouldn't want to do I'm really excited for this and I'm happy that you're gonna be there and I'm happy you get to meet everybody from the pod kit you know like yeah yeah like the community and stuff that'll be there and I said I've been waiting for this event for a really long time and I'm really excited and there's gonna be lots of cool stuff today and whatever so that was my expectation was it was gonna be a lot of fun with new and old people and not flawless but pretty flawless well we talked about this a little bit on a couple episodes ago but we talked about they're gonna have cell problems and issues and you talked about how when a bunch of students come over to Georgetown you deploy repeaters and well not students but like let's say the President of the United States was going to be giving a speech at Georgetown which happens from time to time right yeah we fill that room with extra capacity for wireless service in that area which I believe they stated that that was their plan they were gonna put the sites on wheels cells on wheels meals on wheels no no music on wheels so what was your expectations and prior to coming cuz really we decided to fly you out here and get you a pass like a week before the show a week and a half yeah yeah I mean I was 90% like getting to see all of you guys and do Pokemon stuff but then also like have the perspective of somebody who's not like that hardcore Pokemon go player I I came in at level 15 right kind of seeing how I could interact with everything that they were going to have that's not because I wasn't at that high level 30s or whatever the max cap level is now and seeing how all that stuff would have carried out for me but yeah I was expecting to see some pokemons some pokemons I hadn't seen before and meet people from all over who enjoy Pokemon for different reasons I will say real quick is a like actual Pokemon expectations I was like Oh internationals all over the place tons of Legendary's yeah that was that was kind of my expectation I mean I I was really hoping to be able to catch a Teddy reen yes I showed you the legendary raid trailer the night before we went through the list of banned items in the list of okay items so you kind of got the four for one for 404 with 404 for one one you got the I got the four one one the night before I mean you've been playing Pokemon girl a lot but what was your expectations prior to the event well I had to deal with a lot of extra Pokemon go in the last few weeks so I that as a result got me more excited for it I was expecting a lot of people I was expecting everything to go well just because like it's the one-year anniversary of the game the launch had a bunch of issues so I was like it'll be good it'll be smooth maybe we'll get a legendary maybe we'll get Mewtwo like see I was just excited to kind of just see what was there cuz I wasn't exactly sure what to expect they definitely teased Mewtwo in that trailer did they not it was at the very end yeah yeah the focus of the trailer was the the five bird birds and just for just for clarification mu and Celebi are not legendary Pokemon their mythical so I can't imagine that as Mewtwo and hoe and the other Pokemon that weren't at the event I can't imagine that Mew and Celebi are going to be part of that in the future yeah unless they start using the word mythical yeah mm-hmm I mean are they smart enough to make that distinction it technically is a different game well the Pokemon company is involved yeah I mean during during that legendary trailer it was like neon chick it was like across a building or whatever because they'd be the pan and then it was like the Pokemon company yeah summer 2017 I was sunburned all right so Irene and I drove down we left probably 6:30 in the morning he left at 6:09 a.m. I remember it's about an hour 45 minutes from Milwaukee to downtown Chicago that's taken in consideration traffic because once you're about 30 minutes out of Chicago you're moving at parking lot speeds we parked pretty easy we parked under Grant Park we got our media passes and then I decided to go in to shoot the park this this is kind of the setup for the day as my first impressions of walking into the park I walked in about 8:30 a.m. into the park so there was a couple other media people there but nothing else there was no early people because I think the Sprint customers got in at 9:00 the early catch while I was in there the three tents the three team stations valor instinctive mystic they weren't even set up they didn't matter the TV's plugged in they had at what time was this was 8:30 so a half hour before the early catch whoa the only place that was really fully set up was the store they had all the merchandise and everything and they were still unboxing stuff and they were counting cash and was like okay you guys seem like you're on track there the charging station wasn't set up the main stage wasn't set up they were still they didn't even have them the two big cameras for live streaming out in front of the stage yet and again this is a half hour before the event opens and then walking through like when I walked through I was like hey where's the media tent no one knew where it was it was actually right next to the entrance it was like around the corner yeah so everyone I was like this thing opens in a half-hour and uh it doesn't seem ready on top of Chicago is expected to get thunderstorms and rain throughout the day that was a big thing following the week yeah I mean I was checking on Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday and even when we were driving in it was drizzling and I was like okay it looks like it's gonna be drizzling all day and it's funny because the night before Irene we went out and we bought ponchos we did they were green and red got one not like $0.89 Poncho's at Target and I had them all in my purse I was prepared ready to go very ready yes got all my banned items out yeah no umbrellas the actual ground was just soggy and muddy and that's how I got the nickname black foot wearing real shoes he was were covered in mud what was what was at least cool for me as I was able to get something from the store right away which I figured would be the hot contention point we have wait you used your media credential to get early access to the store oh yeah you are the lowest kind of human you didn't buy me anything what the heck well there's nothing really what did you buy I bought a mystic shirt because I not that okay here's a know here's the thing I'm off the stuff that's gonna sell out fast that he's gonna sell on eBay for four times the price my stuff I saw eBay pays for the supplies yeah I like buying stuff that first off I hate buying shirts because one I don't want to pay twenty eight dollars for a shirt but that's how much the shirt was and that's how much I paid and there never slim-fit I don't know if that's yeah they're never there never slim-fit no I like a good slim fit t-shirt I wear hoodies consistently so there's no point in me buying shirts with things on them because no one ever sees them for me I wanted to buy the shirt because I figured the shirt was only at the event and at least if it's hanging in my closet I can go up that was a day that happened it certainly did happen that was my thought with the shirt too was I think they're probably only gonna sell it here I might as well but nothing else there was enticing to me with two tipet's from buying the shirt because I also bought a Magikarp mega Blok thing that they had which actually wasn't advertised what yeah Legos by the time that I got to the store everything on that board was covered in black tape okay perfect aside yeah the shirts and I think a Bulbasaur pop socket pops out so it's like a handlebar be cool by the time I got to the store it was literally one team instinct to XL t-shirt and a Pikachu Pikachu hat they called them 3d Pikachu heads as the ears came out yeah when I went to buy the shirt this isn't that great of a story when I went to buy the shirt I was like hey I'll take a team mystic shirt and the guy was like I don't know what that means and I was like I want the blue one it was okay and then I was like let me get that Magikarp mega Blok thing and he was like you're gonna help you have to help me out here no like the orange fish can I get that so what was that like mega bloks like the Legos yeah like the far-fetched thing no it's not no I I don't even I I'm gonna be honest I haven't even looked at it I bought it it was eight bucks I threw it in my bag okay when I got back to my car I threw it in the trunk of my car it's probably still in my car I haven't looked right before right at nine o'clock when the first wave opened up these were the people that went out to sprint and got a specific wristband oh I didn't say the line to get in there were two lines there's always - always - no one ever tells you which line you are supposed to be in or which line you should be in I got a story for that so what we talked about will that most of the the reasons that most of these things were probably on the ban list was to get people in faster we like a pax situation wasn't please I don't know if we told you this Michael but at PAX East it was almost like an hour to two hours to get in and it was 40 degrees out because everyone had to go through this is this is every single day good time this is where will adopted the policy of island alliance so if you didn't bring a bag to PAX East you got in instantly oh okay well we got in whatever is what we got we had media passes which worked here too I don't know why I don't know why you guys are so early in the day the same thing was the case if you didn't have a bag they let you in right away yep yep one's for people who didn't have bags but people had lined up at 6 o'clock in the morning you could line up as early as 6:00 there was no battle detectors but they did have the swipe we did they really yeah they didn't have when I was there oh they use did not meet twice when I was going in and out oh well I didn't maybe they gave up on it at some point yeah I was surprised that they had a physician like literally somebody checking that the pills in bottles matched the pills well when we went in we went in the lady was like medic and he came and he looked and I had a prescription medication and I had just like advil or something and except I think I used an old pill bottle for something else I was prescribed and the medic just like looked inside he was like and then he just put it back in my purse but I was like but they don't match the label like they're both given to me but like that's not I'm sure the medic knows like these are the pills I need to look out for yeah yeah honestly what they were doing was looking for any kind of drugs that would be used as you know even prescription drugs contraband or I mean overall they were looking to prevent any kind of alcohol or illegal substances like mind-altering recreational drugs yes yeah not a successful not successful okay says evidenced by our trip to the bathroom obviously people listening to this probably saw all my tweets on Twitter they probably saw everyone else's tweets on Twitter ah there was a man with the goat there was about the man of the gun the whole show was a disaster when this goes up I expected there to be a line and for that line to you know you're back in line you might wait 30 to 45 minutes to get in can I talk about my line experience since I of the four of us I was the only one that had to stand in line you didn't get media past correct yeah easier the car credential together nope yeah they they originally only gave me one media pass and when I got there they were like oh you we can give you two more so I give it to will and I read before they started letting people in though so you were in the wrong line correct there was no sign or any kind of information you didn't what line was what I didn't see that like everyone had yellow wristbands nope because we saw a line of people that was moving and we went to the end of it or what looked like the end of it and got in line as the line it was just a stream of people walking it never stopped it anymore he wouldn't have noticed and I thought that you guys knew because I feel like I thought I said something about the two lines no I didn't know there was two lines yeah there was one that was on the left which was the early entry was the corner yeah the early entry one was the one that Becky and I got in line for yeah there was someone right at the corner where he would turn to head towards the entrance that last block that was checking people there in their wrists that was the only instance of anybody saying that there was that this line was specifically for people who had wristbands and it wasn't until you were maybe like 500 feet from the entrance or whatever so it wasn't until we got to like close to that point that the guy behind us in line said you cut in line and we went but how we got in line where if nobody else was behind us and yes that you don't have wristbands and we said wrists pants for what and he said this is the early access yeah the otherwise other side of the park so my you got so you got out oh yeah we did did you just stay in and see what happened oh no no but they weren't letting we because we turning that corner the person who was standing there telling people the Spence was also taking people out of okay got it so they would have gotten taken out of line maybe a few minutes it mattered I feel like if one or two people without wristbands just happened to wait in that line for 45 minutes they get up I would be like just go in that's you yeah you've wasted 45 minutes early no they were not super willing to let people get away with thing yeah and what they really needed was just somebody like somebody official walking past line just saying aren't respect extra wristbands only it is spring though so there's only just to let people know because I'm sure you guys weren't the only ones who me no stake because when we okay so when we got to the that point and they said that you have to go to the other line we went all the way across the other side of the park and that was the real line that was the line for people who were not really and you're saying that I know the answer that line was probably three times longer it was zigzagging in multiple angles to the point that it just looked like a massive people they were easily like they said 20,000 people showed up yesterday yeah that was easily 19,000 of the people right I can't imagine that the Sprint promotion which was Friday night and Thursday there's Thursday and Friday night I can't imagine they handed out over like a thousand wristbands fine so when we got in line probably already at that point 10 to 12,000 people in front of us I walked into the park before everyone they said come back for your QR code we're not giving them out right now and I said okay they said just come back at nine o'clock come back anyways because we want on the media people here it's just so we can give them a rundown of the show yeah okay cool come back I don't know what the QR code is for but there were stops inside the park that had a Pokemon go logo above them it said like Chicago fest or something yeah I was like yellow instead of that picture of whatever it was and I didn't think of it because my I had a game plan I had everything but I had the Poncho's I had battery packs I had my camera I had my recorder I knew going into this event how what I was gonna do when I was gonna do it and how I was gonna do it when I walked in I didn't think to swipe any of those stops because if you pop a lucky egg and then swipe the stop you get double and it's the first time you're swiping it so it's worth five or it's worth 250 instead of 50 and then with the lucky egg it's 500 so I was gonna maximize and pop the lucky egg and then hit all I think there was like 14 unique stops in there yeah so I didn't think of swiping it but when you didn't go and swipe it the first time it asked to scan a unique QR code which I found out after 9 o'clock but when I was in the park I did get my QR code a little bit early and then I scanned it and then right away there was a hair cross and I was like oh cool because when we were when Irene and I were walking past the line somebody was like hey did you they were talking to each other not to us but they're like hey did you see the hair across there's a hair across and but that in retrospect that doesn't make sense because I thought you could only see hair across when you sweat and the QR I think no I think because when we were in that line I could see spawns inside the park but you couldn't swipe the stops even though if even though you could be in range of the stops outside of the park you couldn't you couldn't swipe them at all because you kind of have the QR code in order to swipe so they did change it halfway through but technically heracross was only spawning within the gates so you didn't see hair crossed I would see like you know normals like pinyon yeah ever I saw a yogi at one point so then once you swiped the stop the all the logos above went away no no they were still up no for me they were all gone instantly so that's where I think the server issues came in because when I swiped the stop all the logos went away instantly it was like okay cool it gets all up because I originally thought oh I have to scan the QR code per each stop that's kind of a hassle but I get it cuz they want to lock these inside the park for the players and prevents poopers from showing up and doing their thing they let all the they start letting the sprint people in and they let them in fast like it went from zero people in the park to what seemed to be like seven to eight hundred people yeah pretty pretty instantly and that's when like everyone kind of spread out it was OMA it was either they went right to the Sprint kiosks cuz there was a sprint kiosk where if you showed them what level you were they would give you actual like patch that you would put on your your denim jean jacket iron that on there was no one there with the denim jean jacket Thanks I mean I was closer yeah yeah you're way overdressed but so that that line was was out of control right away there was a Boost Mobile truck kiosk that was selling batteries that filled up instantly and people were buying batteries right away boost a subsidiary of Sprint I think they were also selling phones were they not yes okay I have a story about that too and then most of the other people went to their designated tents so when they did finally get the tent set up it was probably like 15 picnic tables in each tent and then three to four TVs and then a mini concession stand in the back that sold a couple things they had those banana loungers - oh yeah then the jump bean bags yeah yeah but the concession stands only sold beverages in the tents yes everyone kind of spread out and then there was this weird middle of the park that was empty and it kind of made sense too because the ground was so muddy still and the first thing that happened it was like 9:15 9:20 so most of the Sprint customers are in somebody else unknown just people running I haven't seen people run for a Pokemon since the the first week of the game yeah and so people are just sprinting to this spot and it was actually over by the media tents and sure enough there was an unknown there and I caught it and everything seemed to be fine and then about 10 minutes later no one could connect but it didn't seem like they didn't seem like they it didn't seem like they let in more people because the rest of the people didn't get in until 10 yeah the story of the cursed you know the media tent had like media Wi-Fi where once he got in the tent there was like a password written on like a piece of paper above the free water okay so media Wi-Fi didn't work I don't think it worked all day ah absolute trash so I'm on 18 - what what are you on will Haiti Irene sprint 18 - okay it racks print if you're an 18 t customer so this is what I don't understand these parks were most of the part built and sponsored by 18 t's money are you sure like that is Millennium Park but it's all part of it now like money in parks next door the Millennium Park garage is also it says like Millennium Park grant North Millennium Park grant south yeah but they can put a sign on anything I guess either way even if even if grant park wasn't 18 t's park yes the park across the street with the giant silver bean nugget what's paid for by 18 yeah there's also have right next to that Park is a massive 18 T Tower I have a conspiracy starting to farm in my head the AT&T was a little twisted that Sprint is like getting all the attention on this particular event and they're like oh we're gonna take our toys and go home folks I don't I don't know where the 18 t Wi-Fi was but you know you go to Starbucks or an 18 T store or if you're in the mall it'll say 18 t Wi-Fi and if you're an AT&T customer you instantly connect to it you get free Wi-Fi you don't have to do anything I don't I read the Sprint have something like that where if you walk into a Sprint store you connect their Wi-Fi for free no issues you just I have absolutely no idea okay I know I can actually tell you exactly the spots in the park that the 18 t Wi-Fi working and it was mostly every corner like a back corner of the event around the ID like edge parts and by the media tents there was pretty good 18 t Wi-Fi but did you notice because we were standing by the media tent the entire time that the spawns were ultimately the same and happened at the same time I noticed this throughout the day because I didn't have much else to look at but it was always a Machop Machop Machop Machop my wife called the Machop man man chomp at one point man there was always a man chomp yep a snubbull and like one other pretty common Pokemon at the same time near the main stage which the media tent was behind the main stage yeah all those kind of pop at the same time and then like once an hour we're now maybe once every half hour it was a like a cypher popped up or larva Tarr so a couple Scyther hey larvae Tarr I didn't see any love I couldn't shut up so I read and I got our first unknowns we were in the media area no we weren't we got our first unknowns when we were over in the corner yes that's how I know we were in the corner over by because I went to the restroom and then we crossed over and we were over in the shaded give me a give me a restroom update what about him there porta-potties all right I actually I will give a lot of credit to everyone who attended Pokemon go fests what they did not trash the porta-potties they actually like they were pretty decent throughout the day I used them multiple times throughout the day I also am very happy there is an option that you can get with your port-a-potty order to have a portable hand washing station which is which some people didn't know figure out understand that you pump a pump with your foot and actual water comes out of a sink and you can wash your hands with soap and water they had those which is really nice yeah they did but did people use those yes yeah no my the unknown was in the corner and then later on we went yeah okay so Mikey you got in the other line yes I was this is another thing maybe it was just my phone but I called multiple like I called Irene I called you I called my mom I think I called will a couple times and most of the conversations were hello hello hello I yeah we had a conversation at one point while I was in line for maybe five minutes and I heard you for the first like two of it without issue and then it was non-stop cutting in and out I was like struggling me and that was throughout the day where I could I couldn't even make a phone call unless I was connected to the AT&T Wi-Fi which was only like a fifty square foot radius outside the media tent and when did you actually walk through the doors and walk into the park at about 12:45 yep we were in line for almost three hours and you didn't get the room the beeping no they were rushing people through they barely looked at my bag they didn't find the medication that I had in there they barely looked in Becky's purse they just opened it moved my hoodie around and went all right whatever and gave it back to me and said go ahead and I went through so for the two hours and 45 minutes you were in line we talked a couple times so I was I called you at least probably two to three times during that yeah and I was texting I tried to draw diagrams of where I was I couldn't tell the difference between your diagram and a ziggurat that's not confusing the entire every every conversation was with with you Michael was nothing is working yeah you could and I can't catch anything I felt my mom was actually with you guys too yeah I felt terrible because you guys were in line but at the same time we were doing nothing yet we met some amazing plan and there were there were two there were two girls behind us from Colorado that flew from Colorado to be here and there was a guy from Peoria Illinois who was with us and we spent the whole time in line chatting with them and Joe they were super nice they were super fun one of the girls from Colorado had like the best attitude about everything that was happening just like really positive perspective and it it really significantly helped waiting in line for three hours but one of the jokes was I was updating them as you were updating me I was getting all the insider info at one point I told them nobody inside has any service and we were at the point where the these lines were zigzagging and any time we went around a bend that was like a milestone so we were all like we made it around another band really like we did it and so then when we got to the end and it started to just be a straight line straight to the park they were like oh we don't have any more bends now it's just a boring walk and I said it's okay when we get inside we won't have service and they said I kind of just want to stay in line then because we have service out here and we can just keep talking and have a good time and we don't have to worry about it oh that's such a nice space really it was great and then we got inside and and that was it and you never stopped what we'll do is we'll take a quick break and when we come back we'll talk about John Hanke coming out on stage and and pretty much the day ending at that point yep so we'll be right back lect tubes flag tube with leg tubes 2 flex tubes flag tube with leg tubes to warmers socks the fray isn't like it to Mike good right the phrasing black it to my like tubes leg to leg tubes to leg to leg to leg and we are back from our break let's talk about why we we know Micah spent most of the day in line but let me let me add that it was in direct sunlight the entire time and my forehead is completely burnt yes I Becky is my wife is already super pale she was completely roasted by the time last night like two tone roasted like sick burns Rosa Clara she could barely lay in bed because it hurts so much no I was completely fine now the reason that we got so sunburned though is because one of the rules one of the the prohibited items was specifically that you couldn't bring sunburned to the park or sunscreen into the parts you could bring plenty of sunburn in you couldn't bring sunscreen in unless it was sealed if we opened the sunscreen prior to getting into the park we had to just throw it out yo we were smart we would have brought two sunscreen one to open inline use and then throw away and one to bring in that was sealed yes but we're not smart yeah we're sunburned and I asked someone to add a little color because I know what Steve wants to talk about next that uh I didn't have a lot of problems connecting and staying connected when I was inside and I didn't talk to a lot of you guys at that point so well what comes next came as a little bit of a surprise to me so there were definitely people in the park playing like me the entire like the entire time and I don't know if they were playing consistently the entire time because there were there was at a point will that you had issues yeah yeah and then I put my sheet on that helps tremendously because you you VP and out correct I wonder if I wonder if a lot like the people that were playing consistently like you also did that Irene I I didn't pay attention to any of these but there were the challenge events throughout the day do you remember when the first one started first one started at 11 o'clock correct prior to this the main stage I think about 10 15 ish called everyone over they like everyone gather around the main stage so we can kick off Pokemon and go fast and at this point I'm telling Micah and my Casilla lied and he's like I'm gonna fit and miss the first challenge and I was like well I don't know if there's going to be a first challenge because unless they fix this in 45 minutes yeah all these players cannot connect and when you said that I thought you meant there's not enough people in the park yet too because like I was not aware of these other issues I was like there's not enough people in here to meet the challenge and the first time I noticed issues was actually after mate was during the main stage intro because there were technical difficulties with the screens and their sound and all of that stuff when they were trying to come out and be like hey everyone the screen was flickering and then it wasn't matching up or playing some bumpin music no and he was trying to and the lady was our DJ and it was just like actually like it was just like not working if anybody wants to go on my Instagram one of my Instagram posts was the six acog Oh house beats and it's about a two minutes the Busic we got to enjoy while we were waiting I liked it it wasn't bad no I didn't play bad music the first woman came out and I apologize I don't know her name I looked her up prior cuz they they announced the three women and then mystic seven and I know two of those two of those females were professional commentators for some eSports stuff and then the third one was a really big Pokemon like she was super into Pokemon go and then the fourth person was mystics and they brought out one of them I think it was Lindsay maybe I don't know I read it there I didn't know any of these people I barely knew who mystic 7oz I seen I read you want to describe what the crowd did when we'll call our Lindsay when Lindsay came out let me ask first when she came out did they cut those sick beats yes no more sick B I was yes that's unfortunate I think it might have been an undercurrent not like as loud but ever did they cut it completely well I wasn't yeah I wasn't really having any issues up until like I was saying when the intro came from the main stage she was trying to get everyone pumped up and she was like is everyone ready for Pokemon go fast and it was just like well they were like they did but they were chanting fix the fix the servers because she was at some point she was like let's give it up for Niantic and I think that was when that was the that was the big boo because they were like fix the game we can't play what what is happening like I don't understand I you know she stuck to her script and she none of this is her fault or any of the other presenters fault I'd actually be curious to watch that twitch stream now and like see in retrospect what happened because I heard that the twitch stream was also just a disaster and we wasn't and it wasn't fun to watch that I didn't so what I heard from people around the world like litter as it was going on people were messaging me and they're like we don't understand what's happening but it doesn't look that bad what's going on right so there's a difference in it doesn't outwardly look like there are problems as much as there probably were and what you're saying and that it wasn't enjoyable to watch is that what people know because i yeah i got like it looks like every he's havin so much fun oh I didn't see I didn't see I didn't see any of it but you're saying that people said it wasn't like an enjoyable Thank You ash yeah I think even Jo from Sara B was was like this stream as a disaster and some other people said that I I was trying to chat throughout with people throughout the day but they're pretty much chanting ik fixed the servers nothing's working we can't I think we can't play was another chance yeah and they did this throughout Lindsey's entire script hope her name was Lindsey hey well it is now like very professional for her to you know you know power through that stick to the script you what she needed to but it was a lost cause like they didn't want to hear any of what she was saying no one oh no no one did no one was listening no one was excited she was trying to you if the game was working that script probably would have went over really well yes yeah well then she introduced John Hanke which is the CEO of Niantic person directly in charge of Pokemon go and ingress he came out to boos oh yeah that that was the big one I was mistaken earlier I had heard too from someone who was watching the stream that they had saw that people also at least one or at one or two instances of people throwing stuff yeah which is not cool I didn't yeah I didn't see that I was I mean I was I was filming it the entire time so I was kind of looking at my camera screen not the not the audience I didn't see that but he opened with thanking everyone for coming and then more boos followed and more we can't play yep and then he said we know that we're having issues with our carriers and we know we're having issues with the game knee antic is working really hard to fix the game and we're working really hard with carriers to fix the server so you guys can play and that was like the first cheer yeah of just acknowledging it really put a lot of people at ease of like okay cool you know we just got in the days just starting but what what what he said what he said and I think rang very true to how the whole day should have been he said it's not a sprint it's a marathon don't worry like you'll be able to catch all the rare Pokemon there'll be plenty of spawns I think he mentioned heracross he's like if you if you missed hair cross hair across will be out throughout the day and I was like this like this feels real this doesn't feel like a script this like you were coming out anyways to say something yeah but it seemed like you adjusted and just kind of talked on the fly of like hey we know their server issues we're fixing it don't worry today will be really fun even if like to me at this at this point in time I'm thinking okay it might take him in an hour or two to get the game but even if they get it fixed by one that's still six hours of playing yeah yeah we find out that that actually doesn't happen yeah and finally you so Micah got and everyone else got in there was no line to get in anymore correct we about maybe 400 feet from the from the gate from the entrance lost service like we didn't even get in and we already didn't have service there you go once everyone was in it didn't the overall feel of the park didn't feel crowded now it felt like the amount of people they reserved and the park size they reserved felt comfortable and another thing that when John Hanke came out he said you know we were expecting rain all week and so far it's showing to be a beautiful day and it was at that moment beautiful and then about ten minutes later it just turned into like a heat wave yeah yeah significant but but also the thing that I noted when Micah finally got in was the line to get out yes not only the line to get out but also the line to the information booth with it was super long and all people who had their QR codes in their hands and looked very frustrated this is like this is jumping a little head but when in the media tent when we were talk to the producer who was probably extremely communicative he was like I don't care if you record me I don't care if you write down what I say we're giving you the information to communicate with your fan bases or with other people like that's why you guys are here to communicate our message yeah he said less than 4% of people actually had QR code issues okay way is that what he said yeah it was a real soft talker and there were some people behind me who were talking loud so I did miss some points but also we should explain to people who weren't there the QR code basically what happened is when you got into the park you would go to one of those special pokey stops spin it it opened up a QR scanner in Pokemon Go app when you scanned your QR code or tattooed him or typed in the number sure that is what basically turned on pokey got Pokemon go fest in your app and made you able to see all the special stuff that was happening inside the park so that people who were just walking around outside the park didn't see the special spawns or anything like that because they hadn't registered the QR code so I know a lot of people were aggravated because they're like I'm in but I'm still not able to do Pokemon go fests because I can't even spin app okay stop and scan my QR code I think the Oh mom actually yeah my mom's significant my mom ran it at all I think though overall the QR code was a smart system oh oh yeah absolutely if it had worked if it was lawless it would thing to do yeah I don't know I think less than four percent is pretty okay and I'm sure most of those it's not so much the issue that you couldn't scan the QR code it's that you couldn't get into the game they're just scan the QR code yeah because there was a there was a point where I couldn't even launch the game anymore yep and I I couldn't even tell if it was like okay I'm on AT&T Wi-Fi it's been working all day why isn't it working now you're so bad for you guys I don't even I don't even remember the first challenge because as soon as John Hanke got off stage because he kicked off like get ready for the first challenge and he I think he kind of explained what it was about everyone kind of walked away from that stage of like okay we'll try all right the first challenge was to catch as many normal rock electric grass fire and water pokemon as possible but that's that was the whole challenge that that was no that was the first challenge I think they originally were all supposed to be different but because of the issues they just kept it the same and there were there was a meter that yes on this screen on the stage and us and they were also in the tents if you walked into the tent the meters were there too but but also which I don't know if this is jumping ahead but they also had LEDs screens like in front outside of each of the tents I don't know if you notice cuz they didn't turn them on but I think those were supposed to track like how well each of the teams we're doing I see and like the meters would show oh you know team instinct is has caught the most fire pokemon and is leading this at one point before you guys got when when it was only like sprint early customers got in inside the tents there were meters and there were leaderboards yeah of being like a pit bull dog mom it has hatched the most eggs on insult I saw mom I saw a guy who had won a bunch of medals and like literally he had five medals at the team in sync tent for being like the team instinct player who caught the most fire pokemon and and like different things like that which is like becomes really dubious it's like yeah else could play ways but also one thing of just about this setup that I wanted to say was I was very impressed with how they did the physical setup like the tents themselves the equipment they brought the like little pokey stop models that they set up in it none of it looked cheap no right it looked like they had really put a lot into that physical structure and they had huge like photo stations where it was like a phone and the screen was like clear like clear glass with an overlay of like a Snorlax or something and you could stand behind it and I get a picture so it looked like you were in in the phone there's a picture of me with a cyndaquil in one of those pretty good I wanted to ask anybody that was playing before we got in and we couldn't get any service there were specific stations throughout the entire park where it was like this is the symbol for rock pokémon this is the symbol for electric-type yeah was that supposed to be like specific like rock pokémon would spawn there so electric pokemon there never activate I think so because what I was saying earlier that by the media tent we were getting the same Pokemon yeah like man Chomp man jumpin teddiursa teddiursa and snubbull what if I wanted different Pokemon I would before the server's went down if I walk to a different end of the park I was seeing different Pokemon yeah so I think it was designed to set up like you're always going to get at least Magikarp here you're always gonna get at least Geodude here which is really nice for people who hey I've never seen a Geodude I know at this end of the park this is where the Geodude are I can go get them and my phone doesn't connect now sinned in mind yeah never at any point until a little bit later did I have service really I I had it for maybe just a moment when we got in we were by the media tent I was able to catch a hair cross and from that point forward it was impossible for me to get service I at all I would say the worst was your wife who wouldn't get on the game download the app dude she had to use my phone and a horn it still was crashing so constantly she would get in find a Pokemon throw a Pokeball and it would just crash even before that happened sometimes she would just get into the game tap something and it would crash I left Mitch MidFirst challenge because I looked at the leaderboard and the bars weren't moving oh yeah and no one had any enthusiasm to complete the challenge mostly because they couldn't connect so I left I went back to my car I got my computer and I was like I'm just gonna upload the video of people of John Hanke coming out on stage because people were asking specifically for that and I wanted this is the first time I was using this video camera so I was like well if I'm gonna continue using this video camera I might as well look so I walked in my car got my computer went to a Starbucks I tethered my phone started I quickly edited a two-minute video it was like chop attempt to edit sound because that's just like destroyed everything sound wise and so I quickly uploaded it and then while I was there at the Starbucks there was a bunch of people with wristbands the the Pokemon girl wristbands and so while I was waiting for the upload somebody asked me what I was was doing because they saw all this equipment out on the Starbucks table and I was like oh I just uploading some video of the Pokemon go of it and they're like oh are you a reporter and I was like no no I just do a podcast and then I had to explain what a podcast was but these two older women came in and they were also talking to me and they were they had the go-fast and I was like oh did you did you guys have any luck at the fest and they were like no not at all this is terrible I was like oh that's a bummer they were like we flew all the way from California to come like we love Pokemon go and oh that's really cool and I noticed they had four phones and they were like not we we're on 18 I asked I was like what service provider on you because I'm on ATT they were like we're on 18 T we couldn't connect and I was like oh yeah 100% the same and they said we walked over to the Sprint store and bought sprint phones because they were $100 and we want to make the most of this event so another hundred dollars isn't that big of a deal because we already spent like a thousand dollars to get here yeah and Sprint assured us that we would be able to play on Sprint because their sponsor of the event and they have everything taken care of and so they bought sprint phones with sprint phone numbers to log in and they're like we can't we can't even log in sprint doesn't work either wow that's rough but as I said multiple times throughout the day right like I know what a cell on wheels a site on wheels looks like because I have brought them into Georgetown and I did not see a single one on the outside of the park or on the inside of the park so there was they were not doing anything to augment signal at one point though I pointed that that's where they I went and looked at them those were bolted into the ground it's all a like hang lights and sound equipment for the stage so they looked like a portable Tower yeah ever but I guess they weren't I was when I was walking back so many people were just pouring out of the park leaving and it's only one o'clock now yeah about get back into the park and there what you guys said earlier there there's zero line to get into the park and there's a mile long line to get out of the park because they need to deactivate your wristband properly yeah oh yeah so back in so people understand there was an NFC chip in every wristband that you had to like place against a reader when you walked in and it bleeps green so they knew you were in there you had to do the same thing when you walked out or you could not get back in which I don't understand why but when we left they also stamped your hand yeah because all the technology was family oh you know what I actually know why I didn't even think about it when we came back in and we they scanned us to get back in there were people still there with the QR codes handing them out and said I'll take a QR code and the guy handing them out said I see the stamp on your hand you're not getting another one okay that's actually really smart it's like this is the the bump this is the disappointing thing about the event almost everything was pretty well thought out yeah getting in how the park was set up where to go like the state I don't I Irene did you see even mystic 7 come out on stage I mean I was gone for like 2 hours but that was that was the big celebrity there no not from what I could see I don't think so but we saw him about the introductions yeah but so the only people that were out on the stage itself because I think they did I felt like no one came out ever the only people that I saw on stage was John Hagee and Lindsay yeah good ol Lindsay oh that video we saw oh boy oh boy it's very clear that knee antic loves their Pokemon go you tubers because everyone there was a Pokemon go YouTube in the media area yeah we saw lots of youtubers yeah and we thought it wouldn't be it wouldn't be an episode of its super effective without mentioning allegra frank he has how she's so incredible in person i was I couldn't speak I was in awe she was really nice yeah but we talked with her for a bit she wants to be back on the show so that's very exciting everyone in media was really nice I met trainer tips Nick really great got like five ten minute interview with him that will be on a separate podcast I don't I I shouldn't say that because I haven't listened to the audio so I don't know how so just to mention trainer tips cuz I don't think you were around to see this but Irene I think you were with me it's like the we're doing like the second big everybody come to the concert platform and we're gonna do an announcement and they're like and we're gonna show this video from trainer tips and it started to play and the video was fine and the audio was incredibly distorted so they only got to play about a minute a half of it and they stopped it weird and I could I didn't see it but I could hear the audio but at some point I guess they fixed it because they probably the entire thing I didn't see yet but I was just thinking like cuz I do these kinds of events right and AV is always so tricky and I'm just amazed that they did not have that on 100% lockdown that that could not go wrong the way that it did because that was just like everybody was so excited we're gonna have a trainer tips video trainer tips is here and then it was like playing crash it came it was I believe a video about competitive gym battling what's the okay I think when they played it actually was when we were split up and because I remember hearing the audio for it but we weren't over by the area at that time so when they replayed it like I think I heard some of the audio and I was thinking that we should go back but then it was kind of like whatever I'd rather go to the bathroom Irene you were probably in the park more than at one point I thought you guys were all had at working because I was like where where is everyone and you said you were at stop eight or something on the there's like inside the park there was the main stage with the three tents and then there was like this open field of muddy grass and then there was like this more beautiful park on the other side which were like the street divided yeah and so you guys were over there and I was like oh cool it sounds like things are working now cuz it's what was that two o'clock and so I walked out I walked over there couldn't find you but did you guys walk and hit all the stops and actually catch pokemon at that point it was still I was so in and out I don't I think the best service I ended up getting was actually after we left for the day but at that time for me it was working fine I was able to catch and unknown at some point when we were over there in that corner you wanna speaking of a known unknown do you want to tell them what the unknown spelled or like what kind of unknowns there were Irene's counting with her fingers right now I think there were five six six there are six I don't know how to spell they had a C and H and I AG in a and then oh and it's spelled ACOG oh whoa when you needed another C yeah yeah yeah I think all of us I'm looking away from Steve all of us got all the available letters I could spell Chicago like three times on his face we didn't realize it spelled Chicago until I realized him as as I was leaving for the day yeah when I was still in the media tent we were all talking about the unknowns we caught and then it was like oh I think it's Belichick go and cuz at some point people were saying oh I caught a Z but yeah yes and I and I was confused cuz I caught a C and Irene told me it was an e so I was like no I haven't when I told you Micah at dinner I was like hey you know it spelled Chicago and you're like oh I want the rest of the letters well because at that point I was like if it's random and it's just any of the 26 I'm not gonna try and catch all 26 hear what they have had all 28 if only 26 and the gamut is yes because the exclamation mark and the question are we are generation 3 yep which we're in the original image so if you look at the original image I think you can use that as a really good basis for future images of they showed heracross and they showed unknown and those were the two rare Pokemon at the event the only two rare Pokemon and they were spawning pretty frequently and I think that's fine uh I don't know Irene what do you what did you think of like only having those two rare Pokemon I was expecting them to have more uh but again I don't really know what I mean like that $25 is fine to guarantee that you're walking out with Pokemon you can only get in Brazil and the southern tip of Florida and in Mexico and the rarest Pokemon in the game right now which is unknown yeah I would say I think at that point for a lot of people it was like I just want these two Pokemon so I can leave actually said I would really only be happy at that point if I could catch I had already caught a hair cross I just wanted to catch an unknown I didn't catch one until after we left at like 7 o'clock that's the other thing is when I got back after uploading the video we got another producer meeting for the in the media tent I mean I probably get my time's wrong but this was the meeting where it was just to let you know everything is still planned for the rest of the day the mystery event aka the legendary event is still planned for 6 o'clock we're still going to go through all the challenges we're still working to get the cell providers up we're still work hang on the game so you know just go through as normal we understand that this is really frustrating we're still planned for the rest of the day though and then the next conversation we had with the producer was what we're doing now is we are extending heracross and unknown in a two mile radius outside of Chicago well the way he put it was they're extending everything for the go-fast yeah whatever apply let's be honest people only cared about unknown and heracross at that but also the spinners the pokey stops that let you scan the QR you're right people were having trouble scanning the QR codes there so they could go outside the event and scan it any of the stops oh I didn't know that yeah it's kind of nice they also I believe extended the range for what activated the to hatch eggs so it made hatching them faster yeah the distance for 2k eggs ended up being point-to-point seven kilometers but I'm pretty sure that that was because there were three tiers for the challenge it was bronze silver and gold and gold was the one that unlocked the mystery challenge or whatever but I actually wanted to mention I don't think if any of you saw it I'm also not sure if it's real but um apparently they changed the numbers the milestone numbers for each tier because I wasn't working and it was up on a screen and someone got a picture of it oh I'm changing the numbers I saw it on slack but I'm not sure we talked about the the raids real quick because what was really cool and this was before the disappointment set in is at about 9:45 they were Pikachu raids there were three Pikachu raids and they were 15 minutes long and I was like I think all of the raids were 15 yeah all the Razr which was really smart to be like okay 15 minutes you know get 20 people every one of these raids will be accomplished because of how many people are there yeah minus the fact that nothing works so none of them were accomplished yet but there were Pikachu raids and I was like this is really cool we've never gotten a Pikachu raid it's probably just a normal breathtaking Pikachu but it because now Pokemon go shows you what ball you caught it in it would be really cool to go oh look at this Pikachu it's in a premier ball which means I did a raid that was only at this event like it is another quote-unquote hat Pikachu except now it's like a ball peeking it's just cool it would have been cool to do but nothing of that worked and I know I did see like Tyranitar raids and stuff pop up but it was outside the HMT range that I was getting serviced in but that was that was pretty much for the raids we get another chat with a producer this point it's I'm kind of jumping at all I'll jump ahead but pretty much neotec came out on stage jatt and John Hanke what let me back up again John Hanke was out there all day oh yeah yeah and you can boo that the games aren't working you can chant fix the servers they don't need to hear that they know right they're not unaware of what there's no-one at nee antic wanted this event to fail I actually said when we were walking Becky and I were walking through the muddy field and we were both very disappointed and she looked even more disappointed because she just wanted to she couldn't even get into the like yeah it was just crashing constantly I said I do kind of feel bad for everybody that was planning this because it looks like looking across the park from that field everything was so incredibly well thought out like the station's looked cool the like spawn point stations looked like they would have been cool everybody looked like they thought this was good and thinking about the trailer that we watched the night before like they really thought this was gonna be a super fun event yeah and I can't imagine the heartbreak behind the scenes when you're like oh it's actually a disaster but you know it's even better right because this is somebody's job right they put a lot of work into it as their job and they're like I'm working really hard probably people working overtime making sure like I'm gonna make sure this is the best event ever and you know what's gonna happen tomorrow they're gonna get yelled at yeah and it's like I put in all that extra work something broke and now I'm gonna get my bulbasaur handed to me here here's the thing knee antic has done dozens of these events all over the world before for ingress yes so John Hanke specifically said when I was because I got to talk to John Hanke for a little bit the person I think it might actually been Allegro that was in front of me and I forget what question she she asked but the response was we just had an event in Japan for ingress that was 10,000 people that worked flawlessly and so if you're in the attic and you do the math okay just double everything we did there we're gonna bring 20,000 people instead of 10,000 so this is what we have at the event just double that that double devil doesn't work if you want your steak cooked faster you just increase the temperature half the time oh yeah here's a trick kids if you want more Wi-Fi doubling the number of access points doubles the amount of interference between those two access points there it is doesn't work lane side tips but they've proven that they can do big events like yes between his announcements that he did he was literally sitting on stage all day just talking to fans and talking to people and that's so respectable yes so like a lot of people would hide behind the curtain or be back there yelling at their employees like fix this and even I heard him say at one point all this technical stuff I don't understand so I trust my team that they're doing the best work that they can do there's nothing more I can say what a humble slam against his team is well I didn't know anything go back there and tell them fix the internet they know I definitely have a lot of respect for that guy after yesterday after seeing him like sitting on the stage and talking to people and being involved when it was a mess and trying to like like boots on the ground talk to people who were upset and try and make them feel better about it even though it didn't really help too much I think it was cool I think it helped for those people that took the time to meet him yeah I think it some people I mean didn't help in terms of like the service didn't get any better yeah but yeah so long story short pretty much they were not able to solve the problem within the time frame of the park I think it was about 4:30 when they decided to throw in the towel completely on it so they announced this earlier but I'm just gonna sum it up all in one because pretty much they repeated the same thing at 4:30 with the with the addition of we're kind of done for the day yes exactly but the John Hanke came out in the afternoon and the first thing he said is we understand this was before they threw in the towel but we understand that we're still having connectivity issues we are still working extremely hard to fix it as fast as possible but what we're going to do is we're going to refund to everyone's ticket to get in and the crowd erupted of in Cheers they're very excited for this and I was like you know that's it's really humble like to me if they didn't refund the ticket me walking away with one unknown and one heracross and meeting all the people there like that was worth it to me I was pretty consistently like this is not worth it to me and I was prepared to put up a fight to get a refund for my shirt sure see I wasn't I wasn't in that boat Irene you didn't pay any money because I bought your ticket but how did you feel at that point I thought it was smart I felt really bad for the people that went in spent all their like they bought their tickets off eBay and stuff because it looks like well that sucks alright I don't necessarily feel it but Irene you and I saw I'm thinking you were with me this one guy who was just like furious and he said I spent 300 on my ticket I took off work today I'm gonna lose 250 dollars for my work and I paid so much for the parking and these people are messing me over and everything and I was thinking to myself it's like these are all choices you made it was a $30 ticket or you know what nine hour event yeah I still feel bad though I mean I have a hard time feeling bad for people who paid scalper prices but I mean more like the people that were the people that traveled yeah that I totally definitely I mean they like you said there was somebody who flew all the way from Germany there was a guy I talked to you that came from Brazil and he was actually one of the things he said was he was hoping that when they said they teased International Pokemon that there would be more than here he gets her cross where he lives so he didn't care yeah so what kind of what I'm saying is like be mad that are angry because things didn't work out but don't necessarily be mad at Niantic because you spend five hundred and fifty dollars or you decided not to work that day yeah because you didn't work you didn't make two hundred and fifty dollars like that's not the antics problem at all so then the second thing that John Hanke said after the refunds which seemed to go over very well with the audience is that they were going to credit everyone there with a hundred dollars worth of pokey coins in the game I think there was louder cheers yeah that was very very happy so this is kind of where the scalpers get a little bit screwed because when you got the wristband you had to go to Pokemon go live.com slash wristband and you had to register an email address your phone number and then your name um you did this right Maya and so when I did it for will and my mom and Irene I put their email addresses and their phone numbers and then everyone's emergency contact was me not that that mattered because that was only for the kids but you had to fill it out anyways yeah even if you paid $300 for a ticket which you shouldn't have yes you're getting $100 of in-game credit which i think is smart from a marketing aspect because it really doesn't cost them any money but it also ensures that they're hardcore fans 20,000 people that really liked Pokemon go kind of gives them incentive like okay today was a bummer but I have this in-game cash now and that's gonna keep me playing and while there were some people that walked away really angry and no matter what they said what they did I don't think they would have been happy regardless yeah I think those two announcements they're fixed a majority of the day for people yeah yeah yeah I think so I mean not everybody but monk but like I said there was nothing that he could have said that would have made everyone had right but every but I think also the last announcement we got at the press conference also helped a tremendous which was the extension the two-mile exception now the time extension oh yeah so originally so the third part of that was we're finding your tickets we're giving you $100 worth of pokey coins and we're extending the radius for two miles and then when we we had this conversation with the producer at like 4:30 yeah it was okay here's what's happening we're pretty much done for the day everyone in the park can continue being in the park till 7:00 the event will still go keep in mind at this point there had been no discussion of the like final big challenges right we we heard around like two o'clock that the final challenge was still scheduled yes you know people can still hang out in the parks you can still enjoy what they can enjoy if they can connect we are going to extend hare cross unknown and the two-mile radius we said earlier until Monday morning which for people who are you know staying in to Chicago Saturday night into Sunday or Sunday into Monday that's really awesome there were a lot of people that left on Friday night or Saturday night I should say which don't get to take advantage of that but if you got your hair across you got your unknown it's probably I mean just playing the game at that point yeah with those Pokemon this the stops the eggs all that stuff works until Monday morning with the two hour idiots they also said we're cancelling the six o'clock challenge it was supposed to be lugia which was actually surprised I thought it was good to be Mewtwo yeah I thought for sure like I thought it was a given it was gonna be me too but Luke yes cool yeah Lukey is cool I was surprised how many people cannot say lugia right I shouldn't be talking as somebody who butchers Pokemon names but but even even the producer of the event mispronounced it yeah he called it Lucia oh really not lugia yeah that's weird that's a G GG Lu Jia yeah he was so nice though I know that's not like I like when people say Pokemon in my mom what did my mom call sudowoodo your mom called sudowoodo's Scootaloo Scootaloo she also called dodo doot doot doot oh she called Whomper robo call the Whooper Whomper yeah I think she actually nicknamed her Whooper womper alright is also really good I want to get my mom on the show one day she was not having the it should just be an hour of the two of you saying pokemon name oh she called I remember she called Vaporeon Viper man yeah Viper man yeah oh Shareen said she could what she calls I think called Scyther Slytherin and then two seconds later she was like oh no that's from Harry Potter well we were at Target she called Vaporeon vapor man which is really good really good like the best meme these are all good nicknames you can name your Pokemon and then they said they said that lugia was supposed to be the six o'clock and because team mystic won the challenges that Articuno was the other bonus Pokemon for the night there were multiple people when I was walking around at the end of the day that said the reason that mystic one is because the mystic 10th is the only spot in the park that had consistent service and I said there's no way that's true and I went over there instantly I had service in my lab it was in the I was in a Tyranitar raid I caught a Lapras it was yeah in a corner and it was that I think the corner that faces Millennium Park yeah it was the farthest tent away yeah was the mystic see I stopped going to mister because as soon as I got into that open muddy field I didn't have any service you know I had no service on my thumb it was the only spot that was consistently you could get in it I guess about what it kept walking I would have reconnected yeah the other bonus that we didn't mention is that because the legendary raid the six o'clock mystery challenge was cancelled that everyone who scanned a QR code would get lugia in their account for free which is cool which is great but also it's like I just got this I feel like a lot of moments in Pokemon go is like I remember exactly when I got hit my gym I remember my first raid I remember doing a Charizard raid I remember doing a venusaur raid and having old people threaten to call the cops on me because we parked in their parking lot I like remember getting lantern for the first time with Micah when we were on bikes like getting Pokemon at certain points in time or is like the appeal so just to have something appear doesn't feel it's not the same experience and even more than that right people were hyped up by that video yeah I was like we're gonna have 20,000 people right rating simultaneously in Tennessee B so Bob we watched the video and Irene was like this looks so cool I can't wait for this tomorrow and I said I seriously doubt that anybody's gonna be cheering and pumping their fists and she said you don't know just waiting their fists when they got unknown they were hyped all right and by the time I got unknown I was just like finally I can go home and then the the final announcement when the when they were throwing in the towel they were like we're going to roll out legendary raids globally in the next 24 to 48 hours and there were follow-up questions but the the response was this wasn't planned but because of today we just want to get these legendary raids out as soon as possible for people and that's why rolling out globally yep so I'm assuming that there was going to be like a week or two weeks where only people at Pokemon go best had these legendary Pokemon which is fine like a lot of like games do that where it's like oh you were at the event you get this early but we'll give it to everyone eventually it's just this is your little early access bonus yeah when we're leaving the park at 7 it was probably 7:05 in the first raid popped and it was there was no timer to it it just showed up it was lugia and it had a two hour countdown yeah so normally raids have an egg and that egg has a two hour countdown before you see what it is and then you have an hour to complete it yeah this was just lujah spawned and it was two hours and people were losing their minds we were it's like it's like the fest never it's like the fest just started yeah it was like this was the beginning we were on our way to the ISE Meetup and we we saw it your tweet that said this lugia raid popped here and Jeff and I you're literally 15 feet from the door to the restaurant we were there we were there and then we saw the tweet and I was like take my phone let me show the misunderstanding though was when when Jeff saw the tweet he said the loogie array just popped at the vent and I was like what we're going back right it was it's to be fair just so clarification it wasn't at the event it right near the event it was that the huge fountain from that fountain that was married with children married with children found yeah exactly so was the confusion though because when we got all the 90 show oh wow yeah so only 90 kids will remember that yeah so when we got back there I was like oh this isn't because we got a lift we we just walked all the way to this restaurant and that fire was like I'm really gonna walk we got to get over there so we took a lift that showed up the second we hit it and went back to it and I was like oh it's not at the event it's outside of the event and then I looked around in the game and I was like oh they're everywhere yeah so does what happened for me make you feel a little salty about that lift what had you not realized what happened oh what happened so Steve and I were walking from the exit right yeah and we passed the fountain lugia and I was like I was like we should do this but we should also get to the event because that's important no you said my phone is at 5% there's no way I can do this yes sure I'm just going to the restaurant but also at that point I was like we're getting lujah in a distribution so it doesn't matter that much so we kept walking down Michigan Avenue and then we noticed there was another lugia raid as we were going and I had 13% on my phone and Steve was still like I only have 5% he left I stayed I told you this day yeah I've never done a raid before so I stayed and I did it and it literally took like three minutes yeah it was very quick and got that done and so I was like oh I got lugia first out of everybody get rekt whatever you all I kept walking towards the restaurant a lugia raid popped directly across the street from the rest yeah and I got my second lugia like just sitting outside yeah I walked in and I walked that's when I had battery then and I was like okay I don't feel bad cuz I'd all these people came out to the meet out meet up yeah but I was like I told them all there's a lugia red right across the street we all just ordered food so yeah I didn't even cross the street we're still waiting for the food so we crossed the street did the loogie read it took like five minutes yeah we walked back and it was fine seemed like and there's no clarification on this as of we're recording if you scanned a QR code it was pretty much an instant catch oh it was an instant cash ball one ball that's it and it seemed people that didn't scan the QR code it was dark red for them yeah because I was we were there were people in slack from like Seattle and from like Pennsylvania and they were saying that it was almost impossible to catch and no one in their groups were catching them so it could have also wait that we ran in Chicago or Pennsylvania and Seattle Oh Neri sponsor every bubble so it could have been that it was the two-mile radius was just I don't think I don't think so because there were people at those at those raids that could yeah you're right as well no the one that we went to at Buckingham Fountain they said there was a guy there that said he couldn't catch it so right which doesn't make sense yeah unless it only makes sense if he didn't scan a QR code yeah which also then doesn't like that also kind of doesn't feel good to be like we're giving you a legendary Pokemon we're giving you lugia by the way five minutes after the event ends and I'm not I'm not saying that they shouldn't have done it because props to them for rolling it out as fast they did and it actually worked yeah to go we're giving you this really rare legendary Pokemon here are five that you can now see and that you can instantly catch there's like somehow tissue something weird about that too like okay now if I go into a future raid I'm going to have five lluvias to it i when I did the first one right there were probably a hundred people around and this dude had his camera on a selfie stick and he was like I'm doing a video it's the first lugia raid they did account they were so pumped but out of all the YouTube videos and all the people saying first lugia raid who was the real how many arrows are in that thumbnail but it doesn't matter it just it gave people the experience of the legendary raid that they didn't get in the park that's right exactly well and that's the same thing that you said and I said it went when we got to the restaurant as soon as those raids popped everybody that was upset about the fest suddenly was no longer upset yeah I do want to say is like a PSA though for that Articuno raid it was a mess like it was in it was down a street in the middle of downtown Chicago and there was traffic and people there were so many people there that had zero like mindfulness of the recipe they were standing in the street they were blocking traffic they didn't care about anything there was a truck that was trying to make a delivery they blocked the alley so he couldn't get out he was screaming at people to move everybody ignored him nobody moved no everybody was like laughing about how it was that they were blocking everything where was this spot that was blocking like how is it overflowing into traffic what was it was a side street not not where it was a side street it was at a gym that was I guess a theater right down the street from Buckingham Fountain and it was a not a like a huge Street like Michigan Avenue was it was a side street and so it was super easy for everybody to spill into the street and it was more that the attitude was look at how cool this is that we're blocking everything because there's so many of us unless look at how much of a disruption to the city were being and that doesn't bode well for like future events when the city is like you got it devolved into chaos why would we want this to happen again you don't want to be in Milwaukee County Park yeah exact start removing stops and stuff don't hit don't give the City Council a reason to get mad about the game Irene can you tell us about the meetup I mean you were you were really the one that planned the Meetup I mean I I found a bunch of places I sent them over to I was like all fun fact if there's any meetup or anything that involves a single phone call Irene's usually in charge that is true but you you were there you held on the floor of the meetup you greeted everyone you got everyone situated a lot of people actually didn't show up which is a bit of a bummer but I totally understood because there are a lot of people that left at like 4 o'clock yeah and so they went home for the day so to come back downtown Chicago for a guy I get it I understand but there were some awesome people that came out everyone was so nice but tell us about the meetup I don't know it was really good to see a bunch of people I got to meet people like Pete who I've never actually met in real life but I mean the Internet everyone there was super cool I remember Shannon was there for a little bit I think Adam I'm really bad with names yeah there are two Jeff's yeah Todd was there because we saw I kept seeing Todd in line no we were zigzagging our way we plan to yeah I see shirt yeah yep so what kind of restaurant was it it was called burger bar it was a burger bar yeah really good food so I highly recommend it it's super effective sponsored by burger why were they so willing to set aside half the restaurant for us with no down payment I guess work your magic or is it because they're AC wasn't working they said they said something about that like right they apologized and she was like I'm really sorry like this just happened I didn't really notice until like I was so hot at that I didn't notice as I started eating all right so I don't understand because I'm the only person literally who ate my entire hamburger and all of my troubles okay okay I did not like I no reason only half of his burger and none of your right but you never he always does yeah that that's about that's not usual to man stood what was your issue let's wrap up here I talked to a bunch of people have the meetup I talked to a bunch of people outside the meetup even random people and I just asked even during the lugia raid I was like did you guys feel the event was worth it and no everyone said yes while it might have seemed on Twitter being being terrible being a disaster being like fire fest being like the fest where the kids peed in the ball pit yep I don't know if s that was I just heard about the issue ganache con yes I do feel like Twitter kind of blew up in like it's not as bad as everyone's making it out to be because again I'm not saying that people didn't walk away angry I saw plenty of people walking away angry or disappointed or frustrated but a lot of people I talked to they were just like yeah this is worth it too despite the issues like getting unknown getting hair crossed the big thing I heard over and over again was just meeting all these people doing the loogie oh and doing the raids at 7:00 which was an hour after scheduled but still seemed to work pretty well like that all seemed really great for people that goes right into what how I felt about it though by two o'clock or whatever it was when we went to lunch I was furious I was in pot-bellied and if we're asking me if I was all right and I was like shouting about how mad I was about how much of a disaster this was how frustrated I was for Becky who I dragged here and I mean she came because she wanted to come but I'm so glad I missed that I was super mad and there was a guy behind us at the table who I overheard say that guy's blown up about the Pokemon thing and I was I was mad and I left and I like went and walked to Walgreens like took a break and walked it off a little bit and then at that point I talked to Becky and I was like look we paid a lot of money for this weekend we're here a lot of rice compared to people traveling you're right like you know we drove we paid thirty we paid thirty two bucks for a parking spot we paid yes we paid forty bucks to load up harder those thing 80 cent Poncho's gotta get those 80 cent Poncho's gotta get no and I mean it would yes comparatively we didn't pay em mmm we paid nothing compared to $250 cuz you took the day off work and I blew up at potbelly because they don't have peanut butter and jelly sandwiches my experience then was after after I got upset I went outside and I walked it off and I talked to Becky and I said look we we paid a lot to be here and at this point we just need to make the best of it we need to make the best of what we have left let's try to like have fun and try to catch stuff if we can't we can't let's go look at the rest of the park because up until this point we the only area of the park that I saw was outside of the media tent where I got serviced and back in the corner where the porta-potties were when wil and I walked over there just to try and get AT&T Wi-Fi and it still didn't work I walked around I saw the park that's we found out that mystic had the the mystic tent was the only place that had service which her we caught Lapras is and Becky was you know excited to actually be able to catch stuff at one point we tried to do a Tyranitar raid and it failed because it booted a million people out yeah and then from that point on when we left we found a porygon and we found an unknown and we found all this stuff we found hair crosses and we started catching stuff and then the the raids popped and that was exciting we got to the meetup and we were chatting with all these cool people and having a good time and then you know even when we went to the venusaur raid and it glitched out and I couldn't do that I was still in a really good mood again and after that then we started walking around for the rest of the night until like 11:30 or whatever it was yeah we probably walked around for about two hours trying to catch unknown and just just playing the game and that it liked hanging out with everybody and catching things and having fun that's what I expected the day to be and while I was upset that the actual fest was such a disaster the rest of the day and what we made of it was what made it worth it to me being able to see everybody and experiencing the stuff after the fact my frustration is just that it's a shame that that didn't happen earlier in the day yeah that that wasn't the festival that we had to be outside of the festival to have that kind of fun and that it wasn't taking place inside of the actual park but by the end of it I was happy I was it was a good day and for the most part so it was worth it to you it was worth it after the fact eventually it was worth it it's hard to say for sure for me at least because it's it's one thing without the other it without the fest we wouldn't have been able to do all of the the stuff that we did after the fact but we didn't do any of the thing that we did after the fact at the fest so it's like it kind of it kind of equaled out I guess but I still had a good time by the end of it give me your overall thoughts on the event um I'm so really not sure I was thinking about that earlier like I didn't have a sunburn absolutely just all read it's terrible I got so dark in the Sun yeah like I was really irritated I don't think I ever got mad during the day it was just kind of like this is a bummer uh and I felt really bad for a lot of people that weren't able to get the experience that they wanted I like as mica was saying I think that the post fest events redeemed the rest of the day even it kind of just resolved a lot of the like disappointment that I had I think I was disappointed in the fest rather than yeah anything else that's I mean that's a good way to say it like I'm not mad at Niantic I wasn't chanting you were mad but I was mad because of how disappointed I was in how shot the day was it wasn't that I was upset with Niantic because I don't know enough about it to know whose responsibility it was I do I don't think we said this but I want to be clear that the main issue was actually just connecting to your service provider there was very few instances where the game actually didn't work right unless it was crashing yeah but that could have been a dated exchange right so if you couldn't exchange the day to the games like I'm gonna give up yep it was mostly the actual cell service because when I was on Wi-Fi it worked flawlessly the entire time there was maybe only 10 minutes on Wi-Fi where it just went load and I bet that's when they were forcing or switching servers or pushing pushing the updates they were trying to do to fix the game the the clear issue seemed to be Internet service providers I don't know when I was able to connect with my LTE I am on Sprint like I was fine but then my game you know they were a cycler of the show I couldn't like my game was just bugging sometimes I would be connected to Wi-Fi in my game went load and sometimes it would be loaded but then I couldn't click on anything or I could click on something but then I would just sit there and freeze I mean it could have been 5050 the service provider the cell service providers and the authentication servers might have been at the same time yeah having issues contributing and then and that becomes exponential Irene I drag you everywhere if they do another Pokemon go fast and you know Nevada whatever Las Vegas watch them do Nevada yeah yeah would you go yeah I would definitely go alright go because I I think that it can't be as bad this is what happened yesterday I agree like I think we're on an upswing so we said that yesterday too and we're like well if they do another one who would go and I was like well this is their first one they're obviously gonna learn from this yeah well I think people are understanding enough it kind of some yeah so and if you're not like ok well well he said give me your hot take for the day uh I mean it was interesting for me especially because this is like such an abnormal travel thing for me was like it was so last-minute that I would like left I arrived in Chicago on the same day my expectations weren't too high because I'm not a hyper Pokemon go player is super casual about it I don't really am not so worried about completing my pokedex or anything like that so I recognize the disappointment in I had expectations of seeing not necessarily like special Pokemon but like that having the challenges be fun and interesting things to do you get new kind of games to play with the people that were there that would make it special and like none of that happened would I do it again it depends on the cost and the effort that it tricks right can you you've been to like Nationals and and regionals and stuff like that can you compare the two for people uh actually was talking to somebody about that and I think the big difference is at like US internationals now it's really people who are dedicated to TCG and VGC and have put a lot of time into that and it's not as diverse of a crowd I mean you're not getting a lot of older people in the TCG and BGC area we're in Pokemon go you've got that full range of Ages I mean kids - like your mom who's older than me who are really invested in it and I think that's more of a focal point for them that they've just like they are pokemons go is everything so I think that's what kind of created more of the tension for the event but also this was probably about five times larger than any national championship right national championship is about 4,000 5,000 people you have to earn your way it's also really nothing to do at those events as weird as that as you say you hang out in downtown Indianapolis yeah you do but like like they don't even usually bring official Pokemon Center stuff there it's look when I talk to kid who kid Stark who went to us in or whatever they're calling it Nash major internationals I was like did they bring Pokemon Center at this time because they do bring Pokemon Center to Worlds yes and he was like no it's all third party vendors selling stuff from China and I was like why are they missing that opportunity and like I don't want to buy that stuff and then when you're there you're either competing all day and it's exhausting yeah you're lucky if you're gonna get a lunch and you're usually behind schedule and there are side events which are fine but some of those cost money to enter yes and besides that there's nothing to do so at least even it even everything was broken I still felt like there was like I could still connect to Wi-Fi I could still catch pokemon here or I or I could walk just two blocks outside the event and I could still actually play pokemon go normal yeah yeah and I think actually what I didn't get across clearly was at US Nationals or at a regional the people who go to those are Pokemon fans they just there's a lot of TCG players that don't know yeah I just because when I think of like Pokemon go there's a lot of the TCG players are like X poker players or like Magic the Gathering players and so they're like I don't I didn't know this Pokemon maybe that's a different conversation but I just think like there's a lot of people who are Pokemon go players who don't care as much about the Pokemon I would agree more about the Pokemon go game yes and that changes the nature of the crowd I would almost say that's evidenced by just playing Pokemon going Milwaukee how many moms that don't know anything about Pokemon or just hanging out at yeah it reads and that's a that's a longer conversation I think we could have and I think we all knew that that Pokemon glow players are a different type of Pokemon player and that's it good or bad I think it's good overall cuz now they're getting introduced in the franchise and hopefully that leads them down a road to you know enjoy the anime or to maybe pick up the card game or Pokemon is this franchise it's just not one single thing yes and I think that's what our show does really well is that we're acknowledging all aspects of the franchise and there are Pokemon specific shows that tackle specific topics and that's fine and that's great but we're all here because we love Pokemon as the franchise and just not because of Pokemon go not because of the main series game not because of the anime you asked that question didn't you at one point yeah so well enter with this I got to talk to the CEO of Niantic I waited in line it probably took maybe 45 minutes to get up there but I asked them two questions I got a picture with them I'm probably not gonna post the picture cuz it's kind of bad makes me look bad got like a weird neck thing going on I wasn't happy with the picture afterwards auto shop dude but I asked if this was the last Pokemon go-fast event and it's kind of a dumb question because of course it's not but I wanted to hear it from CEO if he was willing to answer it and he was he didn't hesitate he was like today was really disappointing but we're not gonna let us stop that from improving and doing this again in the future and he said you know we still have our Safari event planned in Europe we still have the event planned in Japan the Pikachu virus Pikachu absolutely out prey because you Byron I actually talked to some people who are like planning to go to Europe for the Safari zones and planning to go to the Yokohama yes--you outbreak so he's like we still have those planned earlier onstage he did say that they did plan on doing this again next year they didn't say dates or place or whatever they just said that they wanted to do it next year which leads me to believe that after the Japan event that'll probably be the rest for big events the second question I asked was how will he felt that Pokemon Go has captured a big bigger audience than the main series games could ever do and I think this important question for a lot I wasn't expecting uh you know an in-depth answer or anything but I think it's an important question for all Pokemon for the entire Pokemon fan base to think about because you have 20 years of Pokemon you have seven generations of games and of course their main goal I would assume they're met one of their main goals is to get more and more people to play pokemon with each generation generation one is easily the most popular because it was such a such a viral outbreak at that time it was a peak to outbreak at that time such a virus generation 2 very popular I think generation 3 and 4 were kind of the low points and then with 5 and then I think 6 did better than 5 and I'm pretty sure 7 is still on track better than six there's they still didn't capture what pokemon go has captured with you know getting my mom to play and getting you know your wife to play Micah and so what his answer was was he pointed at my phone and he said the reason we were able to accomplish that is because of this everyone has a mobile phone everyone can download this game for free anyone can play and because of that is why we're in more players hands than something like the main series game yeah hey whether you like it or not I think that's very important yeah so that is that that was the event if they do another event this year cool I would be I would love to try to go to it you know what I would love to go to the Europe stuff and the Japan stuff but that those are expensive tickets that is very funny like we said time and time again totally understand why people left that mad especially if they spent like a thousand dollars in a flight yeah for me it was spending you know thirty two dollars to park and then however my four or five dollars in gas to get down here and an hour and a half of my time maybe my my tune would be different if it was a two hundred dollar flight yeah but but even for the people that stayed I it sounded like the it sounded like the Friday night before was incredible to play pokemon go there was lose every where and people were playing all night and that would blew up social media that Chicago was just quote-unquote lit yeah so it was all for people who didn't live there it was all new stop so if you had a lucky egg it was like 500 XP s stop and they were non-stop everywhere yeah I think the I think the overall message is like while the fest itself was a disaster and bummer and nee antic was extremely apologetic for that and they were extremely upset with themselves for that and that's you know those were words right from the producer that where I was talking to will and I at the time they were so sorry this happened but for a whole weekend of the Friday night with Chicago just blowing up with lers and new people and everyone were walking around playing and then while the Saturday most of the day was a disappointment that after that evening seemed to be a big success and then if your is still in Chicago for Sunday that that event extends throughout Monday morning so it's not planning to do and I believe you are taking advantage of that correct yeah yeah I'm gonna head back to Chicago it's only it's only an hour and a half there on an audiobook yep walk around try and find that unknown oh yeah I'm missing one unknown and I think I would have better success doing a bunch of raids while all those players are down there yeah I could probably go downtown Milwaukee and maybe get one or two or or whatnot but I think because there's still so many Pokemon players there on top of just how many people are in downtown Chicago it'll be very easy to like accomplish what I want to accomplish in a shorter amount of time yeah it'll be interesting to see if raids in Milwaukee are still for people who went and scan their QR code if they're still instant caches yeah yeah yeah I guess well that doesn't really matter too much because they're gonna go away yeah yeah sorry tomorrow well that's that that is Pokemon go fest we will be we will be back next week with a normal episode and if my audio from all the interviews I captured sounds good you guys will probably get a bonus episode this week I know I talked to reversal and trainer tips and twin tendo it was funny when I talk to that guy was like be honest man I haven't seen a single one of your YouTube videos and he just laughed he was so nice he just laughed he's like totally understand there's so much content out there yeah but I find out what I plan on checking out his stuff so got a couple interviews there so hopefully that sounds good if you don't hear about it ever again in the future it's probably because the SD card got corrupt or it just sounds awful who knows I I hope though it turns out for you guys but I think that'll be it you can follow us on Twitter a little bit of housecleaning no way l-'izzat wash in the sink Micah is at Micah the brave Irene just like falling asleep during this pot right away just everyone said everything I wanted to say just like okay drag sorry first your con get in here you guys get in come on in Devin carrots on Twitter was there anything that we hope do you want to talk about the goat now oh no you I'm sure that we mentioned the goat like an hour ago people were like oh wait I want to hear about the good bonus post-credit yeah they made it this far they get to hear about the goat hear about the goat it was when Steve ditched us to do the media tour appropriate term and we were standing there waiting for him to come back and I turned around and there is a man and I think he was wearing a yellow coat or something that was like sewn together rags yeah and and he had it had horns horns I know it had horns because we saw it in the line by the fountain and go was real upset and wanted to get out of there and like plowed into a guy that was on Oh and just took off done like I mean he he was still on the leash and the guy had the goat but you the goat was clearly like dragging the guy out of a yeah there patiently standing when I saw them like next to the street and I was just like am I dreaming why is there a man with the goat yeah so I took a picture and I tweeted it people liked it so that highlight that's the world famous Chicago to the the go goat Pokemon know fest Pokemon you said yesterday which is really good there's a goat Pokemon right go go yes sir no goat the only goat Pokemon skiddo skiddo but that's the trio from black and white are also kind of goat Oh aren't they horses they've got horns aren't they a horn sues no Kel Kel do spell me horsey one because I call the O is a pony he's adopted it doesn't matter after you go you don't call baby goats ponies so therefore they're hosted roses he just said those Kelly eels like adopted fancy so it was a Pokemon go fest and it was a goat so I feel like go goat is probably the best person yeah also real quick on the I didn't notice this when I took the picture but you know the merchandise board yeah with all the things with the black tape covering yeah this is spelled Evie wrong good Vee nice Evie Evie good Oh baby oh I was like wait there was a shoulder or Evie yeah that's cool were they selling the magic our pants they're a bunch of people now all the game all people with magic are pads they were all like custom probably ever see things or something like that got it I think that's a wrap though oh I didn't say you follow me on twitter at dragging a lake and you can follow a Pokemon podcast on twitter at pokemon podcast if you were confused or still wanted more details about what happened i think i summed up a pretty good live tweeting of the event on pokemon podcast and you know kinda i was i was delivering a news as fast as i was getting it at the event if there's another pokemon go fest in the future i think we'll be there and i'll be doing the same thing hopefully patreon.com slash it's super effect if you want to support the show we will probably be doing a live stream on August 5th which I believe is a Saturday to celebrate our seventh year anniversary there will probably be something for everyone and then something specifically for patreon backers or that day not don't have the details worked out next weekend is my first weekend at home in like a month and can we have like a on no we won't sing you happy birthday yeah nobody wants to hear that oh yeah
