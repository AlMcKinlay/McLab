[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 428th episode of the pokemon podcast it's super effective i'm your host sbj here with me is will for some reason i've been playing really old games gardenscapes that's not an old game that's a current game i was playing katamari damasi last night failed to roll up the moon personal shame um but i've been playing a lot of monster hunter generations ultimate because even before they announced rise i've been playing that a lot so it's weird but i'm super psyched for ryze and you didn't like world right heck no that's a garbage game oh my gosh uh greg is here hello i am also playing an older game right now as well i'm playing shiny force because i found out shining force and shining force 2 were available in the app store and so i downloaded them and i'm reliving many many many years ago i don't know where we have some dumb news this week i don't know [Laughter] okay start with what new set has do charizard in it go there all right we'll start with that we'll start with the tcg uh champions path is out i heard that was a good set launched on september 25th just this past friday it has the elite trainer box if you can find it okay so this is a weird set we've it's probably the fourth time we've talked about this it's releasing twice so it released september and i think the second release is like november 11th or 17th or something probably the week the dlc comes up because they like to line this all up but the second release we know for sure has like a piers set um where it's like a bigger box i think it's like four or five booster packs ops promo obstagoon that's not out yet but what is out is uh four things there's the double v box obviously double and hop are on it and there's the moto stoke gym the hilbert gym or whatever the hillberry hill hillberry that's nessa's and then the grassy glide gym whatever milo's town is i can't remember that town so grass water fire sets are out double set is out and then the elite trainer box is out the etb we call it in the biz in the biz they're certain you could make those town names really hard to remember yeah moto stoke hillberry and uh which one are we talking about milos milos oh it begins with a t doesn't it turf field kirkfield herfield okay so elite trainer boxes are normally forty dollars and come with eight booster packs uh these holiday ones hidden fates dragons exalted uh shining legends uh they're fifty dollars so they're ten dollars more but they come with two extra booster packs so if you can find a charizard charizard's on the cover you can find an etb of champions path i would recommend buying it even if you're not interested because they're very hard to find right now and you could probably just sell it for twice the price to a friend because that's the situation we're in but you get 10 tcg cards the full art promo featuring charizard v 65 card sleeves 45 tcg cards rule book damage dice coin flip acrylic marcher markers blah blah i opened up an etb it's on youtube youtube.comcast if you want to see my polls opened up all 10 packs the best card you can get in the etb is a shiny charizard and i believe it's going for about nine hundred dollars now the first last week before the etbs came out they were selling for two thousand uh there was multiple bids on a couple two thousand dollar ones i think that's all out of the system now but uh still shiny charizard as of this recording is going for about nine hundred dollars the second best card i thought it was going for a lot more than that did it drop in price it did drop yeah it might plug it'll it'll it'll go back up in price once people realize they can't find each they can't find these packs anymore so it's dropped i'm sure we'll go back up the second best card in the set is also charizard number one best card charizard number two best card charizard and i believe that charizard is going for about 200 as of this recording so you can either try your luck of buying an etb and opening the packs and hopefully getting one of the two charizards or keep the keep it sealed and then sell it and then let them open it and realize there's no charizard in it those are in so in the history of the tcg has it been that there's been a card that's worth like 500 and an unopened pack goes for more than that there's not a single pack that will go more than a card for the most part okay the most expensive pack right now well besides like gen one i think like if you want like a base set jungle somebody who doesn't hasn't played tcg in a real long time their ears probably perked up because they heard jungle uh i think a base at jungle pack goes for like 40 dollars more recently though hidden fates which has you know a bunch of shiny mewtwo shiny charizard and all that stuff uh i think a hidden fates pack goes for about twenty dollars and that pack came out last year i think the charizard from that set is close to seven hundred dollars hidden fates charizard i think is 700 people like charizard this is true this is not a lie as much as as much as people are like i'm so sick of charizard you are in the minority we hear you i mean but the rest of the world likes charizard i'm pretty sick of charizard pretty tired of charizard i think it's fine it's fine i am way more into pokemon masters venusaur with sigma suit leaf yeah she's cool that combo of janine and leaf poisoning and dropping their stats is my jam right now last bit of tcg news is also on uh september 25th galerion surf fetch came out um tcg box sorry uh that is uh one promo card featuring gallerian surf fetch v one oversized promo card four tcg booster packs uh we have i believe two darkness ablazes in here a base set sword and shield and uh because they will never in the next they will never they will continue to have xy evolutions even after i die they will never run out of xy evolutions they they have plenty of them if you get an xy evolutions let me tell you the best card in that set charizard okay does this does the surf fetched come with a surf etched pin no pin this is not a pin collection does it come with uh a surface token thing no coin what it's yeah it's you know it's why buy this thing you want the oversized surface card but you can't use it i mean technically you can what's that big card sticking out of your deck pay no mind to the giant card i'm shuffling here i mean what do you even do with those they're just for display right like you cannot use them in game yeah they're just displaying they're just collecting dust i don't yeah i mean they don't fit into your binder because they keep making them different sizes i think we had a couple parents write in and just they just said their kids just love the oversized cards i don't i don't i don't get it i mean i like oversized cards in certain settings but like not in the tcg thing unless it's a commander that i can be like here's my giant commander yeah nothing like that boo all right we have more pokemon news but we actually have a bunch of non-pokemon news this week that is related to pokemon in a way obviously i think um if there's switch or 3ds news i feel like the the consoles you play pokemon on are probably newsworthy for this show so we'll circle back to pokemon news uh we'll start with this article off euro game right nintendo 3ds officially discontinued what does that even mean the assembly line for it has shut down oh but what if i need like spare parts i'm sure this is store dot nintendo wait hold on back up what part are you playing uh like if the back cover where the covers the battery gets a scratch in it and i want a fresh one yeah yeah i'm sure i'm sure store.nintendoga.com is still selling replacement parts like if you lost your stock i will say there are so many wonderful things about the 3ds experience that have not been carried forward to the switch and that i do miss street pass what i got my mystery pass is after a night well street pass would have been useless this year i'll tell you that much look we cannot use this year as a basis for anything exactly everything was useless this year this year is a wash it's like saying well i never saw my friends so friendship was useless in 2020. you make you make a valid argument you know i can't [Laughter] i'm gonna move on for that after a nine year run uh more than 75 million units sold the nintendo has killed off the 3ds production has now ceased on all 3ds hardware models including the new 3ds uh and the new nintendo 2ds xl quote we can confirm that manufacturing of the nintendo 3ds family of systems have ended a nintendo spokesperson told our sister's site gameindustry.biz nintendo and third-party games for the nintendo 3ds of systems will continue to be available on the eshop nintendo.com and retail i just had a horrible realization this means that that really beautiful gold zernius 3ds from pokemon x and y will never be produced for you it is never coming i've been holding out hope for so long look as as we're all avid target shoppers the writing's been on the wall for what over two years when you look at the 3ds section and it's just like an end cap with pokemon mario animal crossing and that's it yeah i don't i can't even maybe okay watch maybe like the two copies of yokai watch that have been sitting there for two years that no one's bought yet yeah uh the existing library of more than eight a thousand nintendo 3ds games contain many critically acclaimed titles that can provide years of content to explore and enjoy there is no uh expectation that the 3ds eshop or online services will be effective in the near future which is probably the most important part here people are wondering if they can still street pass pss wonder trade etc uh last year we saw the arrival of the nintendo switch lite switch numbers are doing well 3ds was launched in japan back in february of 2011. so it'd be 10 years old um in a couple months here uh europe one month later the long-awaited follow-up to the nintendo 3ds oh this is just explains that it did the 3d and we know what the 3ds did so the wii u was killed off pretty quickly they ceased production of the wii u relatively fast and um it's been over two years since they've produced a single wii u maybe even more than two years and their eshop and their online services are still up and running i i'm not mistaken you could still play smash brothers online pokken tournament online um and almost positive you can still buy mystery dungeon uh which is one of the virtual console games on the the wii u i haven't turned my wii u on in i don't know what four years so sure yeah it's been a while for me too but it's still plugged in i should probably unplug it from my my whole mess that's true i have it upstairs i have bayonetta 1 in bayonetta 2 on the wii u and it's like i kind of want to play those but also are they not out on switch i don't want to buy them again oh no but convenience look i've got katamari damasi used to play and monster hunter generations ultimate to play i don't need other games yeah i know what's probably the weirdest thing for anyone listening to the show would be no i guess it doesn't matter that much i was going to say what happens with pokemon bank because that would still need some sort of online i guess that's probably not dependent on nintendo servers right they would just have to keep the server running for banks specifically yeah i think that that's it's separate yeah i would imagine it's separate because like the web browser on the 3ds won't stop working uh netflix on the 3ds won't stop working is netflix on the 3ds there was some videos yeah netflix is on the 3ds i'm pretty sure it was i mean i downloaded it then realized why i only played my 3ds at home where i will have netflix on the big tv and the 3ds in my hand yeah you so you even in like diamond pearl black and white you can still trade locally you can still battle locally you just can't jump on look before somebody writes in being like there's a server i can yeah sure i'm there's some fan-made server you can i'm sure that works i'm not doubting it but the official nintendo servers are down for those so you can't wonder trade gts trade you know go online and try to find a japanese ditto so you can masuda breed and gen 4. but i am sure there's there are workarounds and there will be workarounds when the 3ds online goes off i just don't think it's going to be i think if they're gonna keep the wii u stuff open 3ds is more than safe i think i think we're okay there i don't see it shutting down in the next year or two years honestly personally yeah probably not but three years all bets are off yeah yeah three years is a real long time for them to keep something up on the thing that hasn't been in production get a lot of news that came off september 25th here's some more news this is very very recent this is off game spot uh nintendo's switch successor will arrive before 2100 what what nintendo confirms it is working on new hardware but we only have the widest window for when it may be released what is this what is this article uh well i'll read it to you this should should surprise no one but nintendo is not going to exit the hardware business anytime soon as part of the company's latest corporate manager management briefing the firm revealed they are working on new hardware and it will be released before the end of the century nintendo confirms that the nintendo's next gaming system will launch sometime in 20xx that is what they said during the management briefing they said it will release 20xx realistically whenever the system ends up being it will surely release long before the end of the century nintendo is not committed to any dates uh we i mean we are scraping for news that that is literally the worst news article i've ever like it is look we've had bad news articles here we read bad news we cover bad this is a bad one this is a this is a good one in the sense that nintendo as of two days ago in a meeting said they are working on new hardware but this is obvious they're always working on new hardware until they say the only thing that is newsworthy is nintendo saying hey we're not going to do hardware anymore that's probably why just assume that we're doing hardware because that's why stick they announced pokemon sleep a year ago and that's not a thing i mean here's a news thing for you lakes announced we're still wet we are working on still being well i don't know i was over at cedar lake this morning it wasn't it wasn't you yeah little girl the new story is lakes are suddenly no longer wet that's when we start getting concerned not hey lakes are wet still are confirming that they're going to be wet there is the room there was the rumor from wall street journal that nintendo was working on a switch light and a switch pro that rumor came out at the same time like what i'm saying is the wall street journal reported both of those products in the same reporting one came true but the wall street journal also i believe if i'm remembering correctly i don't have it in front of me this was obviously before the switch light arrived they said that they wanted to release the switch light first for holiday and the switch pro would come later so if we're putting some tinfoil hats on the switch pro is still the thing they're probably working on right i mean they it they've they upgraded the game boy to the game boy pocket they upgraded the nintendo game boy advantage pocket or yeah sorry game boy to gameboy pocket game boy to game boy pocket was an upgrade right same system just a slim down yeah but it's still an upgrade you use batteries faster game boy color gameboy color is an upgrade i'll give you that game boy advance is a upgrade i'm not sure game boy pocket i mean i suppose if we're gonna can like i don't consider switch light and upgrade because they made it smaller and took the controllers off yeah i mean it's a lateral i suppose okay nintendo ds to the ds lite i guess that's not that's not i would say it's an upgrade because the battery life was better and you're not losing any features in the ds lite it's smaller no yeah the ds light was a much better system actually yes light was much better than that did they fix the screen light problem um like it was a little bit brighter and didn't eat your battery at an atrocious yeah the battery was better and then the screen was better but the hinge was bad because the hinges would crack look they had to get they had to cut somewhere they're going to cut on your hinges so then it was the ds the ds light to the dsi which was an upgrade because that was a processor upgrade and then the dsi xl and then we had the 3ds to the new 3ds so that was a processor upgrade so i don't see why we wouldn't get like the switch pro and get the processor upgrade i mean they don't really need to move on from the switch it's doing pretty well doing really well i think i think the switch pro is still probably in the in the cards we'll end up buying it if it comes out yep cause we're fools well if it's if it's an actual upgrade it depends on how big of an upgrade it is also depends if there's a pokemon special edition of it because much like all the other upgrades i didn't buy it until there was an actual special version because i usually the upgrades aren't worth it i don't regret upgrading to a new 3ds i don't think i saw a benefit from it but i don't think i regret it i mean you got to play the games that only played on the new 3ds yeah what i don't think i played any of those games xenoblade was one of them right i don't remember there was always a hunter generation yeah i think you could play that on both i just think it ran like garbage on the original one i was very happy holding off until i got my pokemon special version and then i then i bought it i did not to get it i didn't need to get it right away because just the upgrades like the upgrades were not worth buying another 400 console i can't remember like how many 3ds's i bought but i think it's like ultimately like of all types of 3ds probably four or five oh i like i know i have four 3ds somewhere in this house oh my gosh i see i see four 3ds on my no i see three 3ds's on my desk and one ds which is a pink one from gamestop that i ordered a white one and they sent me a pink one but it's an okay pink so and the pink was good no yeah my pink diaz got used so bad that it that the hinge finally broke and i was like well it's actually the end of this console and i've been on the 3ds for a while so going to get this fixed we'll get back to pokemon news we got a oh gosh i think this might be the worst this might be the worst news article of the show but we gotta take a break we'll be right back we can skip it stop going to sam's club stop buying the four gallon tub of peanut butter but sam's cup has some really good deals stop stop stop going to sandpaper the 18 pounds of cream cheese is on sale [Music] the 18 pounds of cream cheese is on sale somehow you can't eat 18 pounds of cream cheese before they expired [Music] we are back the suspense all right this was sent in by andy i'm already angry no fault to andy not andy's fault andy is just the messenger here it doesn't matter and i andy gets into trouble a lot so i a i'm surprised that this wasn't typoed b andy come on this is off my nintendo news i really only just have to read the headline because there is no content to follow nintendo has applied for pokemon heart gold and pokemon soul silver trademarks oh well remakes confirmed the article is literally two paragraphs it's at most ten sentences i i'm sure there are people that are jumping for joy they're like yes this is the moment but do you think there's like somebody over at game freak and they're like hey frank we got some trademarks expiring what do we got on the docket uh it's just a bunch of pokemon stuff yeah let's not renew them i don't think that series is doing well let's just let them expire we don't want to waste the 50 bucks to renew the trade like that conversation didn't happen right because like why would the pokemon i can't even think of anything the pokemon company at this point would let expire maybe pokemon duel maybe the pokemon dual trademark comes up yeah they might like do we'll go no but there's multiple dual games and i can let that go yeah that's probably true they put yeah i mean it's it's like if you if you have owned anything on godaddy and you have like you own like big bootysquirrel.com you're like like i don't plan on doing anything with this but if there's the smallest chance you're like man big booty squirrel might have it not not this year not next year but in the next five years i'm gonna make some then you just renew it you just pay godaddy the 11.99 and you just renew it you forget about it for a year there's like no way they would ever let these trademarks expire it's not really news i don't know why i went with that domain i don't know why that was the first thing that came to mind yeah there's i don't think there's any news here but i mean is this did it say renewed the trademark or did it say trademarked it for the first time no it renewed it but that's even worse and so the trade the trademark does cover other things besides the video games right it would consider it would it would also cover like um the anime any merchandise it would cover any any publication any promotion anything right yes any any of the tcg cards so if they ever wanted to reprint you know dauntless or whatever unleashed whatever tcg stuff the trademark would apply to that too so what what what i don't even know what trademark law in japan is is it like every 20 years 10 years i'm not sure i'm not a japanese lawyer yeah yeah i'm not a no one sure when they have to renew those and then of course it would like if international trademark law would apply so that's a whole other kettle of fish can of worms pokemon cafe mix that's a game that i've played once door twice join other players to recruit snorlax with the po this cafe is getting really booked here they got torterra up in there now they got well you expand and there's like people can sit outside too right for like social

i'm i'm sad that you can't you can't let that go i can't it's i i can't say that you can't let it go that it's horizontal because that is just horizontal games are the worst i don't want to turn my phone it's not even no no i'm not going down this trail again this trail of madness no no no bust out the email inbox of all the people who agreed with me all the people there are 7.8 billion people and four agreed with you as a point zero zero zero zero zero one percent i don't see any issues here speaking of more mobile games uh this pokemongolive.com big october stuff happening here october research breakthrough will be a sha ninja ninja coming back shed ninja ninja there's a d in there there is legendary raid rotation articuno just left us before this recording zapdos is now available currently and then um starting on october 2nd mall trace will appear for a week and then from for two weeks after mult race from october 9 through october 23rd origin form giratina as the one that looks like the worm will be available and this will be the first time it will be shiny what's the other form called origin form and dauntless i don't know no wait wait wait wait wait wait no origin and i want to say because it's distortion world yeah is it normal form no isn't it just giratina it's just no i think it has a forum name why why would the hard questions uh is it altered form alternative altered form altered form altered form and origin form this is the first time that origin form again the one that looks like the worm will be able to be shiny although i think the altered form is better for like pvp but i'm sure if you if you like if you like pvp and pokemon go first off i'm sorry second off well look pvp would be fine if niantic can fix it and every time they seem to fix it another issue seems to pop up but i don't even know i just play it so little i don't even know what's currently wrong with it i just don't enjoy it i don't remember the current it's very hard to keep up with what's actually broken if you do play pvp you already know this i'm pretty sure the altered form is better than origin form in pvp i could be wrong on that we don't know what's happening after october 23rd i don't know something spooky i'm gonna say dar cry uh that's my guess why not i guess yeah but they don't know we don't know what's happening over halloween the spotlight hours are changing uh every tuesday from 6 p.m one hour spotlight bonus first will be world cap pikachu in spotlight which one's world cup world cap is the one from journeys so this is a brand new pikachu it's a brand new world we live in not even this that is the right song yeah don't that's not how it goes so that's october 6 on october 23rd it will be origin cap pikachu that is the original ash hat the triangle symbol i believe yep that one can be shiny uh and then we have uh tuesday october 20th which is shepit and then tuesday october 27th which is duskull and then the bonuses here is with the world cap you get double the xp for catching the origin cap you get twice as many candy the shop it you will get double transfer candy that's a very good one even if you don't care about getting shut it good time to transfer all your pokemon and then um duskol is twice xp for evolving so these are every tuesday they're an hour long i'm going to probably say that the worldcat pikachu probably won't be shiny because they didn't specifically say there's only one pokemon they've turned chinese off for and that was meltan that i remember that wasn't an accident that wasn't an accident i know they've accidentally turned off chinese but original cat pikachu can be shiny so they don't have to state that they usually don't state usually don't state when a pokemon is already shiny that it can be shiny again but normally when they introduce a new pokemon and they don't state that it's shiny then it's not shiny so i'm assuming the world cat pikachu won't be shiny but it's it's first time and you know niantic you gotta release it the first time then release it the second time with the exclusive move and then release it the third time a shiny and then release it the fourth time shiny with the exclusive move extend the life of our product there are very vocal people that don't like the hats i don't i don't i that's fine i don't they're just they're boring it's something to collect it's something to collect period end of sentence there's no more there's no more to that sentence it is something to collect i think that i like the hats i'm not super upset i i think probably their problem the problem the probability of the argument is is the hats take up other spawns i'm assuming is why they would be upset it's like oh it's a happy pikachu and it's not a execute all i have is a huge sigh i just we have limited design space for spawns and now you're just throwing in another hat mouse and we still don't have all the ones that are missing i don't want to hear about no keklia why it's still missing keglian and world cat pikachu probably on the same pedestal you catch one of them you complete your deck so you'll never use it for anything again yup give me my kecklion and then keclam will go back to being forgotten about forever just like smeargle is the last time somebody boot up their phone to take a picture to get some miracle to appear um october limited research will be alolan meowth uh so on october on saturday october 10th from 8 a.m to 10 p.m you'll be able to complete exclusive field research to encounter meowth from the kanto alola and galler regions and there will be limited exclusive time to research limited exclusive time okay check the shop for available incense pin app berries and lucky eggs so this is just a saturday event where you just i guess yeah yeah just saturday for almost over 10 hours 12 12 over 12 hours 14 hours of meowth uh i could do some more gallery meowths i don't think i have enough i think i'm a couple candies short for berserker oh wait does it evolve yeah i don't see why it wouldn't i i have egged so many of those things oh wait i don't know there's not like gallerian meowth candy never mind i have so much meowth candy we know two of those can be shiny we know that canto analomous can be shiny don't know about galler probably not again they didn't state so probably not there's the fashion themed event that will start on october 2nd through october 8th which we should actually probably talk about and then finally um october is uh has a lot more halloween you can expect new avatar a new halloween cup which i don't think got delayed slash cancelled because the flying cup did i don't the halloween one did yet probably will get cancelled uh there will also be an event celebrating niantic's anniversary and the changing of seasons ooh does that mean deerling fortuitous or smashbox be aware of your surroundings okay so i don't maybe i'm reading too much into that or maybe seasons or seasons would apply dearly for sure yeah it's weird as they would call out changing of seasons and not have that be something well especially because they're in the unova pokemon right now right yeah and i'm assuming we would start getting we would start getting probably kalos pokemon early next year so they kind of gotta kind of get them push out the last like 14 that we're missing or whatever they haven't pushed out the last ones for everything okay exactly have a fun with long champ and pokemon collaboration arriving soon in celebration in celebration of accessories coming between the pokemon company and long champ what is long champ will never never heard of it you are my fashion connection non-american coach i would say if i am your fashion connection you really need to reevaluate your life choices if it's not made by a skateboard company it barely graces my skin come on now you are all about the fashion masks so oh that is true but they don't fit very well let's be real you're far more into the fashion than i am pretty sure i did the conversion right i went to long champ's website they do they did not have the pokemon bags for sale but they did have their own bags for sale and they were 600 euros uh which is the equivalent to 700 usd and also being a french company it's not long champ it's a long charm the pokemon company and long champ paris beginning of the paris fashion week i think that sentence gives it away parish paris fashion week i don't think like forever 21 is showing up at like paris fashion week right you're not getting like a 14 t-shirt

long chomp avatar item in pokemon go then match your trainer avatar by picking the same long champ item in store no okay for more information please visit their website uh and okay so a couple things from this i just searched longchamp they do sell long champ stuff at nordstrom it looks like like a hand purse is like 145. this yeah about 145. they are going to sell like pokemon purses so uh so it's not a it's not a deal between niantic and long champ deal between the pokemon company and long champ so the real question is how much did longchamp pay the pokemon company to get their items in game and to get an event like but also why would long chant like is there that big of a crossover between pokemon go players and purses or handbags like these are these are pretty expensive handbags under a thousand dollars we're not talking yeah expensive for a handbag dude no i've been there and they are they're approaching high-end end bag uh high-end bag prices but they're like the same prices like coach and i would say coach is a step up from like you know just going to target uh coach bag for 125 dollars you can fit like a quarter in it are you saying coach bags are more well look i said there i did google search 125 for a handbag i don't know how big that handbag is from nordstrom this could be last year's model uh this bag is pretty big actually oh it's not leather though this is a cloth this is that's that's important yeah this is where you go this is a cloth handbag for 145. i mean i'm looking at coach right now and a clutch is 375 dollars oh you got to go you got to go to the car is that koi perks because the clutch is nothing a clutch holds barely your basics so yeah the lowest price bag i can find on the coach site is what they call a belt bag what the rest of the world calls a fanny pack yep for 122 dollars yeah okay i bought long champ's website function we'll do men's business bags here where i don't think any of us are in the department in the field for a hand purse so if we're gonna if we're gonna look at like let's say a backpack let's look at a backpack a plain old longshot backpack is 395 one of the fancy u-shaped ones that looks you know cute is 640. like they've done fancy stuff before the pokemon company has done fancy stuff before they've done wedding rings they've done well their wedding rings weren't exactly that fancy but they have worked with like designer brains before yeah this seems like one of the more expensive ones i mean it's up there but i mean they make what there's people out there who pay a lot of money for their pokemon go stuff yeah no i don't i don't doubt that people who have heard of long trump and who have for us lonely streamers who barely make any money a thousand dollar backpack out of the budget right yep yes i and i don't even know if i've only seen a couple screenshots of the pokemon stuff and i only saw like purses so i'm not in the department for a purse so i i don't know if they're making a pokemon backpack or i would want the pokemon backpack but i would also assume that would be anywhere between like 600 to a thousand dollars but it doesn't seem like long champ would have to advertise in pokemon go to move this merchandise i mean i can't even get a basic black briefcase off their website because it's sold out so like i don't it doesn't like it doesn't seem like they have a problem selling their own merch to the very like to their audience they probably know their audience very well and what they want to pay for what they want to buy so i i i don't know what they like i can't imagine that the pokemon character overthinking it i i yeah one one of them reached out to the other and said hey let's do a crossover and they're like yeah that's chill let's have some fun and there you go it's not about dollars and cents in this i mean here's the thing if if longshot wants to go into lower end products or they want to get into other areas these are great ways for them to get brand recognition like even if you can't afford it now let's say they want to release a low end line into target or into other department stores like macy's this this builds more just general oh i've heard of them before it also just makes them seem like oh this is fun it gives niantic something unique and special it gives both at least name recognition between two separate audiences it doesn't really matter what they sell because both are going to sell to x amount of people who want to buy them they are immediate high-end collectors items like i there was no reason for pokemon to have a fossil watch yet there it was and yet i bought it like fossil was selling just fine back in the day but it just it just adds a unique thing that people can buy who already know that brand and like that brand and spreads the word about that brand in a fun way i'm not i'm not saying pokemon fans are cheap i mean they're going around buying two thousand dollar charizards but you i think you're also very focused on like the us pokemon go player market the the japanese pokemon go player market may be completely different right yeah no that is that is true well i mean for this show it's it makes sense for us to focus on the us because i i mean i know how many people listen to japan it's not it's not a lot our biggest audience i'm just saying the long shot crossover might be oriented towards their japanese audience where you know fashion in japan is x levels up what we would normally put on our bodies yeah i mean even if you had the money to afford these pokemon bags whenever they arrive i'm sure they will sell out very quickly that i i don't doubt i mean look at the 200 those skateboards were 250 bucks they sell that instantly yeah they sell out like if you did not law if you were not waiting for the email of like where they're in stock like they were gone and i don't know how many of each skateboard they had but you saw the picture they made a lot of them they made a lot of them or they photoshopped a lot of them in guess who's getting one for christmas did you order one no i'm not allowed to spend money on tuesdays i'm only allowed to mention things that come out on tuesdays to other people who might want to spend money on me and then they end up buying them what did greg get me you'll find nothing both of you will find out hold your horses greg was the one that bought all the skateboards i have my skateboard ebay empire starting so hold out it was a big investment but it's gonna pay off like that ancient meal again i don't i don't mind hat pokemon i'll take hat pokemon over patrat [Applause] what about patrat wearing a hat now we're now in business checking ebay real quick for charizard skateboards well don't give away my username looks like 450 but no bids no look for the uh rayquaza one right charizard wasn't in this drop well that's why i assumed the charizard was the more sought-after one there was last time it was the last drop and they held on to it they they put it next to their ancient mew so it could appreciate in value all of mine are next to my beanie babies my ancient mew and my burger king gold meal i am going to make bank okay the rayquaza one sold these are i looked at sold sold for 3.99 so 150 more than retail the togepi ones with seven bids sold for 360. the toxtricity one sold for 425. the mew1 oh they're saying that there was 250 of each made in their ebay listing oh yeah because i'm pretty sure when you ordered it you got a card saying which number you got so that makes sense so you would know that you got like five out of 250 or or so the mu one sold for 525 dollars that was what you should bought not the togepi i don't know which one i'm getting whichever one my mom managed to get see another rayquaza here for 435 sold uh togepi for 350. umbreon for 440. mew for 450 what was really impressive too was uh the you know the order was made on tuesday uh my mom got it on friday wow do you know what's sad is a lot of these ebay pictures have the same flooring and the same set up for the pictures meaning the same same people same person bought them and then immediately put them on ebay quit calling me out it wasn't me i think i think as long as your mom didn't get togepi you're probably not you're probably in a good boat but i like together yeah but what if you had but wait what difference does it make i'm gonna get a wall hanger i'm gonna hang it on my wall that's true i'm not here to flip it well oh well maybe kick flip it but that's it but that's it just once just that once yeah each one is unique according to mr bear walker how is that possible because they're handmade right aren't they i can't hand make what there were four styles five times that's why it took him so long for drop two he had to go to the woods chop down the tree oh boy oh boy you want to believe that you go right ahead press the wood color in the rayquaza it was all that one man create fine lacquer from the shells of beetles yes hey at least all these skateboards had free ship all right all right all right spencer sent in that there are new halloween stuff on pokemon center uh it's the stuff we talked about before it's just finally stocked so um shout out to the uh score bunny with the nikket outfit which is a reference to the anime that's probably the only one to really mention there question of the week though yes greg it's all you it's the question of the week let's hear that question now it's the question of the week asked from the attic channel in slack i want to answer the question but i don't know what can we can we hear the question and then we'll be able to also decide whether we want to answer i don't think any of us have enough knowledge uh with all the issues going on with 10 cents do you think 10 cent do you think it will affect pokemon unite i don't know what issues are happening right now yeah i i have no idea i guess we i'll i'll look into it for next week because i don't know what's happening with 10 cent uh and i don't want to be like yes or no because i don't know how drastic it is uh but it's china so it's probably very bad well let's see money.cnn.com has it as a headline tencent is having a tough year um there's also a headline following tick tock us may now be targeting china's 10 cent on security issues 10 sounds pretty big though yeah like 10 cents like the amazon of china so i don't even if it's a bad year it's gonna take a lot to bring down 10 cents this this seems like a much more involved like question question about 10 cent because i mean if it's it's hard to know because like right now it's rumors that they might be targeting them so like we'll know in a little bit and it's probably better to ask that question once that's yeah settled or given a positive direction but uh will it affect us getting pokemon unite like permanently i doubt it yeah because that's not the developer they're just the publisher yeah exactly on time no it's not it was yeah it was like another company that had a name that was hard to pronounce brandon says what in your opinions is the most over-hyped pokemon opinion or stance for example i think the too much water statement for gen 3 is really overstated and used as a scapegoat argument against gen 3. i agree with that it is way overstated there was way too much water it's 50 50 is the is the entire thing of the game it's half water half land that is the theme of the game and i will have butter and there's half on land in in universe too many caves there are too many caves period caves are not interesting i think over-hyped pokemon opinion i think the most over hyped pokemon opinion is that gen 2 is good i mean gen 2 is good i think all pokemon games are good yes i don't think any main series pokemon game is bad i just don't think gen 2 was like the pinnacle of pokemon yes i think my over hyped opinion is new pokemon games are too easy yeah you i i think that is i agree with that one i think that i cannot stand that statement because gosh i don't want to i want this to be a huge rant don't don't get into the speed rant we all go to youtube the rant is on there yeah i should make the the so the first pokemon the first pokemon game you play is always going to be the hardest and that's not necessarily to even say that that pokemon's gonna game is going to be hard if you understand like role-playing games in general um so for example like the first time you you've i think a lot of people have this that are our age like the first time you fight brock and you scratch with your charmander or something you're like oh that didn't do any damage um or like i used ember on onyx it didn't do any damage oh i used vine whip on it like you learn throughout playing the game that which pokemon are weak against what's it what attacks like you that is something you learn and then once you get there you cannot unlearn it it's true you can't i mean you can but sure yeah i guess anything theoretically but when you get to blaine at that point i always use blaine because he has the worst pokemon ever he is like a ponyta darkening and right when you get to blaine you can't you you know at that point in the game fire type pokemon are weak to water so you know that that is what you should do and you literally had to surf like across two rats of water to get there so when people say like new pokemon games are easy no you just you've already learned at that point that fire is weak to water and it's very hard to not remember that i mean like it's sometimes hard to remember like oh what's fairy week to or what's very strong too but like the very basic horrors of like water fire grass is is what the game revolves around i mean as an adult who came to the games they were always easy pretty much yes yeah i mean the the the level of difficulty has never changed the amount of grinding you have to do has changed right but grinding does not equal difficulty or fun so like when people are like i want pokemon games to be harder i'm not a hundred percent sure what they're asking for i mean i know even if they increase the like even if they balance you off let's say like you know you're level 30 you walk into a gym they bring you down to level 20. that gym level 20. you still know that if i use a water type move here i'm that is the best move and i will knock them out like you still know that yeah and i even it like it altered across alternate chromosome i think is a really good example of that fight you know alternate chroma when you get to it it is for most players not all significantly overleveled and it it's significantly faster than pretty much every pokemon and it one shots almost any pokemon unless you know unless you have the information about it right so if you looked up what alternate crosma's typing was you would know what it resists and what is super effective against it but if you went into which i mean kind of which you can do for any pokemon but if you don't know like uh i don't even remember what alternate across them is it's like dragon oh gosh it's like dragon something i can't even remember what it's like dragon psychic i think that seems appropriate so off the top of my head i don't even know what would be like four times effective dragon is weak to dragon psychic doesn't resist dragon anyways speak to ice dragons weak to ice dragon's weak to ferry i don't think psychic doesn't resist fairy so even even if alternate crosma was level 100 and it had perfect ivs and evs you can still beat it with a level 26 masculine i did it because i just understand how pokemon works i just focus the masculine endured retaliated aquajet okay cool it didn't matter what moves it knew it didn't matter what stats it were i just think the like newer pokemon games are too easy kind of misses the whole fact that they were they were always too easy right it misses the fact they were always easy and the fact that like most times you lose even even in like competitive pokemon which i've done a lot of this weekend most of the times i lost wasn't because i didn't understand pokemon it was because i was surprised with something and i think the most in our slack community a lot of people said they lost a raejan for the first time because they were like oh a dragon type person i'm going to bring these pokemon and reihan doesn't use a lot of dragons um and if you don't know what duraladon does duraladon is very powerful if you if you don't do that so i think maybe i guess what people are actually asking for is i want the game to surprise me more with like just these one-off gimmicks but once you learn the gimmick that's the thing though is like once i learned joel once i knew jolteon had shadowball i go oh well that jolteon probably has shadow ball so uh the second time i fight it i kind of know what to expect now also jolteon learn shadow ball just a fun fact i mean i think people want i think what people want is more surprises but i think where a lot of the arguments break down is and i've said this multiple times and i'll say this on the show they want to relive the experience they had as a child and you can never do that as an adult yeah you can never go back you have too much experience to be completely surprised by something like you were as a kid nothing is new anymore once you become an adult and it's very hard to go back and say well when i was 10 that game seemed so hard well yeah because you were 10 like your brain hadn't fully formed yet you can't you can't keep judging games based off of how they were when you were a child because you didn't have an accurate view of what that game actually was like and you can't go back and play it again now because you are prepared for that game and it will be a completely different experience and you will allow most people allow nostalgia to override a lot of what the flaws are but trust me as a person who approached it at age 28 those games were easy and they always have been easy difficulty is not why i'm playing pokemon why are you playing pokemon for like a million other reasons collecting breeding i also do my friends really understand people so when people are like i want pokemon to be hard i mean i guess maybe you could have harder puzzles in the gyms i mean i think when they say if anybody asks i want want it to be hard they need to define what hard means for them because more hard is just who knows what you mean who knows what you find too easy who knows what you want to actually be more hard is it catching do you want catching to be more frustrating do you want a nuzlocke type thing where you can't use them after they knocked out like you need to define what hard is right because i just i just don't get where like if somebody's like disappointed in how challenging the gym leaders are the elite for the rival it's like those those those people that complain also just don't seem to be the same people that are interested in competitive after the fact and like the latter and the battle tower like i've done battle tower tons of times in sword shield and sometimes i just lose not because i don't understand but because sometimes the computer is just like oh they just quit claude fisher okay well i guess i'm dead okay um but that's i get that a lot in the twitch stream where people come in and they'll be like i wish pokemon games were harder and i was like do you do competitive and they're like no i don't want to play against real people i was like oh oh oh oh yeah see that's just the thing what do you want i don't know it is harder i mean i i it is so hard to determine difficulty in an rpg because the main thing of an rpg is to tell you the story yep and difficulty is secondary to that now if you want an action game then there are ways to make action games difficult but that's usually timing and dexterity stuff which makes it a very different game like even people say oh if it was real time will you have a real time game in pokemon masters and you don't like it well that's real time greg it's mostly real time yeah so like what is hard because this has never been that game they have never been difficult games not once i would say getting a hundred wins in a row in battle tower uh in sun and moon ultrasound ultramoon was for me very hard well yeah there there are competitive can be very difficult and they've built in like if i remember correctly the trees also learned how you were playing the game what your team could do and ratcheted up the the people who came out based off of that information um so that was built into the game and if you're saying all the gyms should do that then gyms can't be type based because battle tree isn't type based i also don't love the argument of like well if they get rid of type based gyms it becomes harder because like that's what your rival check is for yeah i mean you have a rival who does that you had and who did it yeah well pokemon of the week oh boy oh boy uh let's see what did we have for last week's pokemon of them i don't know you didn't you didn't get the answer you didn't figure it out give me the clues again uh so the previous week's pokemon could be identified by just one letter uh this week's psychic type pokemon is represented by every letter and some punctuation and gallerian if you look at the gallerian alphabet it does not look like this pokemon because this pokemon does not exist in galler and i would say the other clue was that it's not that exciting of a pokemon in the traditional games but in pokemon go boy oh boy people people are looking to get these guys so there you go there's your clues it's [Music] the best is fifa isn't even in pokemon go yeah it is i said people are looking to get these guys and no one wants to be best and [ __ ] [ __ ] up i've seen a lot of people on my friend list that had the shiny fee bass and they're walking with their shiny females though you gotta walk it it's unknown yes yes it is the the alphabet pokemon or whatever it's i don't know what its name is what its typing is the symbol pokemon the symbol okay there you go that's what letters are our symbols i'm sort of bummed that in like so in spell of the unknown there are a bunch that were like greek alphabet letter unknowns and those have never appeared in the games yeah and they never will yeah wait for the uh gen 9 and greece in greece ooh there we go you want to know what's more useless than a hat pokemon in pokemon go unknown i mean eventually i'll have all the ones to spell my name how many letters do they have out 20 well 26 letters and then the exclamation in the are they all out in pokemon go yeah okay because when they first came out it was just like p-a-x yeah they do they'll do every unknown can spawn in the wild but only one unknown spawns every 20 minutes in the game so it's only one location at a time in the world in the world in the world somebody like data mined it it can be any of the 26 letters yes anywhere anywhere in the world anywhere in the world but once every 20 minutes that is some rare pokemon right i can't i can't figure out how they calculated it and it's not obviously an official source but it's because they were they were able to figure out i mean it's like a spoofer thing right because you can spoof to any pokestop um and like look but based on like the ratio and unknown being one of the rare spawns and based on how many pokestops there are in the world it was uh it can only spawn at one pokestop at a time if there's not an event intriguing could be different though i [Music] since they turned it shiny or they made some of them shiny this year and the shiny is kind of dull blue yeah i do like the um well the question mark shuffle icon i think is yeah favorite it's a good one it's cute i know it's also looking at you like real sarcastically yeah exactly unknown is currently represented in the trading card game by the most cards of any pokemon after pikachu with the with a unique 90 different cards that's even better than chair is aired unknown was the only generation 2 pokemon not to be featured in the pokemon ranger series yeah disappointing despite unknown being able to use tm 10 in generation six and seven it still cannot do so legitimately because it will already know hidden power two main official uh artwork for unknown represents a g for gold and silver and an f for ruby and sapphire which may allude to the acronym game for game freak the other trivia is not as exciting true all right you ready for this week yeah it is a quiz i hope you guys studied it's a pop quiz as the we used to call it i don't think they call them a pop quiz anyway i don't think are they surprise quizzes now i that's i we have to not be cruel to the kids [Laughter] have to be able to handle what we throw at them ahead of time either way this week's pokemon of the week quiz question one which of the following types has been represented by only one starting pokemon evolution a fighting b steel c ground d dragon question two which of the following types has been represented by only one starting pokemon evolution a poison b dark c rock d ghost question three which of the following phrases is a mispronunciation mispronunciation of a phrase meaning to give specific focus hey i can't keep this straight a in fencing the phrase on guard means the opposite of the pokemon ability wonder guard no guard magic guard friend guard five the following anime character used this week's pokemon in an episode before evolving it a sawyer b ash c orca [Laughter] oh man well there you go if you can get the correct answers to all five of those questions you will have enough information to figure out who's this week's pokemon of the week you are definitely gonna need to post those uh yeah i will work up this h-o-r-c-a-p uh i forgot to say this at the start of the show but we are still doing a giveaway for a nintendo switch light and a copy of pokemon sword or pokemon shield that will be in the show notes if you want to enter pretty much just follow twitter instagram all that stuff everything twitch.tv slash pkmencast for twitch instagram.com pkmencast uh twitter pk mencast reddit is r super effective though cannot change the the name but it's all good um you need a reddit community uh i think that's it greg is that white wing will is that washing the sink i'm at dragging a lake i guess we will oh actually the last thing is i think on wednesday we'll find out if we won the podcast awards i'm not 100 sure how
