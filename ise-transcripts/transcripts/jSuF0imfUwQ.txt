really old games gardenscapes (0:38 - 0:43)
that's not an old game that's a current (0:41 - 0:46)
game i was playing katamari damasi last (0:43 - 0:47)
night failed to roll up the moon (0:46 - 0:48)
personal shame (0:47 - 0:50)
um but i've been playing a lot of (0:48 - 0:51)
monster hunter generations ultimate (0:50 - 0:53)
because (0:51 - 0:54)
even before they announced rise i've (0:53 - 0:56)
been playing that a lot so (0:54 - 0:58)
it's weird but i'm super psyched for (0:56 - 1:01)
ryze and you didn't like world right (0:58 - 1:05)
heck no that's a garbage game oh my gosh (1:01 - 1:09)
uh greg is here hello i am also playing (1:05 - 1:12)
an older game right now as well i'm (1:09 - 1:13)
playing shiny force because i found out (1:12 - 1:14)
shining force (1:13 - 1:17)
and shining force 2 were available (1:14 - 1:20)
in the app store and so i downloaded (1:17 - 1:21)
them and i'm (1:20 - 1:23)
reliving many many many years ago i (1:21 - 1:24)
don't know where (1:23 - 1:26)
we have some dumb news this week i don't (1:24 - 1:27)
know (1:26 - 1:30)
[Laughter] (1:27 - 1:33)
okay start with what new set has do (1:30 - 1:34)
charizard in it (1:33 - 1:36)
go there all right we'll start with that (1:34 - 1:38)
we'll start with the tcg (1:36 - 1:41)
uh champions path is out (1:38 - 1:43)

september (1:43 - 1:47)
25th just this past friday it (1:44 - 1:50)
has the elite trainer box if you can (1:47 - 1:52)
find it okay so this is a weird set (1:50 - 1:52)
we've (1:52 - 1:54)
it's probably the fourth time we've (1:52 - 1:56)
talked about this it's releasing (1:54 - 1:59)
twice so it released september and i (1:56 - 2:00)
think the second release is like (1:59 - 2:02)
november 11th (2:00 - 2:04)
or 17th or something probably the week (2:02 - 2:05)
the (2:04 - 2:07)
dlc comes up because they like to line (2:05 - 2:08)
this all up but (2:07 - 2:10)
the second release we know for sure has (2:08 - 2:11)
like a piers (2:10 - 2:13)
set um where it's like a bigger box i (2:11 - 2:15)
think it's like four or five booster (2:13 - 2:16)
packs (2:15 - 2:19)
ops promo obstagoon that's not out yet (2:16 - 2:20)
but what is out (2:19 - 2:22)
is uh four things there's the double v (2:20 - 2:24)
box (2:22 - 2:26)
obviously double and hop are on it and (2:24 - 2:28)
there's the moto stoke gym (2:26 - 2:31)
the hilbert gym or whatever the (2:28 - 2:32)
hillberry hill (2:31 - 2:35)
hillberry that's nessa's and then (2:32 - 2:37)
the grassy glide gym whatever milo's (2:35 - 2:38)
town is (2:37 - 2:41)
i can't remember that town so grass (2:38 - 2:42)
water (2:41 - 2:45)
fire sets are out double set is out and (2:42 - 2:46)
then the (2:45 - 2:49)
elite trainer box is out the etb (2:46 - 2:52)
we call it in the biz in the biz (2:49 - 2:54)
they're certain you could make those (2:52 - 2:56)
town names really hard to remember (2:54 - 2:59)
yeah moto stoke hillberry and (2:56 - 3:01)
uh which one are we talking about milos (2:59 - 3:04)
milos oh it begins with a t doesn't it (3:01 - 3:05)
turf field (3:04 - 3:07)
kirkfield herfield okay so elite trainer (3:05 - 3:09)
boxes are normally forty dollars and (3:07 - 3:10)
come with (3:09 - 3:13)
eight booster packs uh these holiday (3:10 - 3:13)
ones (3:13 - 3:16)
hidden fates dragons exalted uh shining (3:13 - 3:18)
legends (3:16 - 3:20)
uh they're fifty dollars so they're ten (3:18 - 3:21)
dollars more but they come with two (3:20 - 3:22)
extra booster packs so (3:21 - 3:25)
if you can find a charizard charizard's (3:22 - 3:26)
on the cover (3:25 - 3:28)
you can find an etb of champions path i (3:26 - 3:29)
would recommend buying it (3:28 - 3:31)
even if you're not interested because (3:29 - 3:33)
they're very hard to find right now and (3:31 - 3:34)
you could probably just (3:33 - 3:36)
sell it for twice the price to a friend (3:34 - 3:37)
because (3:36 - 3:40)
that's the situation we're in but you (3:37 - 3:42)
get 10 (3:40 - 3:44)
tcg cards the full art promo featuring (3:42 - 3:45)
charizard v (3:44 - 3:48)
65 card sleeves 45 tcg cards rule book (3:45 - 3:49)
damage dice (3:48 - 3:51)
coin flip acrylic marcher markers blah (3:49 - 3:54)
blah i opened up an etb it's on youtube (3:51 - 3:56)
youtube.comcast if you want to see my (3:54 - 3:58)
polls opened up all 10 packs (3:56 - 4:00)
the best card you can get in the etb is (3:58 - 4:01)
a shiny (4:00 - 4:04)
charizard and i believe (4:01 - 4:06)
it's going for about nine hundred (4:04 - 4:08)
dollars now the first last week (4:06 - 4:10)
before the etbs came out they were (4:08 - 4:11)
selling for two thousand (4:10 - 4:14)
uh there was multiple bids on a couple (4:11 - 4:16)
two thousand dollar ones (4:14 - 4:18)
i think that's all out of the system now (4:16 - 4:19)
but uh still (4:18 - 4:21)
shiny charizard as of this recording is (4:19 - 4:24)
going for about nine hundred dollars (4:21 - 4:26)
the second best card i thought it was (4:24 - 4:28)
going for a lot more than that did it (4:26 - 4:30)
drop in price it did drop yeah (4:28 - 4:32)
it might plug it'll it'll it'll go back (4:30 - 4:33)
up in price (4:32 - 4:35)
once people realize they can't find each (4:33 - 4:38)
they can't find these packs anymore (4:35 - 4:38)
so it's dropped i'm sure we'll go back (4:39 - 4:43)
up the second best card in the set (4:41 - 4:47)
is also charizard number one best card (4:43 - 4:49)
charizard number two best card charizard (4:47 - 4:50)
and i believe that charizard is going (4:49 - 4:52)
for about 200 (4:50 - 4:54)
as of this recording so you can either (4:52 - 4:55)
try your luck (4:54 - 4:58)
of buying an etb and opening the packs (4:55 - 4:59)
and hopefully getting one of the two (4:58 - 5:00)
charizards (4:59 - 5:04)
or keep the keep it sealed (5:00 - 5:06)
and then sell it and then let them open (5:04 - 5:08)
it and realize there's no charizard in (5:06 - 5:10)
it those are (5:08 - 5:13)
in so in the history of (5:10 - 5:16)
the tcg has it been that (5:13 - 5:18)
there's been a card that's worth like (5:16 - 5:20)
500 (5:18 - 5:23)
and an unopened pack goes for more than (5:20 - 5:24)
that (5:23 - 5:26)
there's not a single pack that will go (5:24 - 5:27)
more than a (5:26 - 5:30)
card for the most part okay the most (5:27 - 5:32)
expensive pack (5:30 - 5:34)
right now well besides like gen one i (5:32 - 5:35)
think like (5:34 - 5:38)
if you want like a base set jungle (5:35 - 5:40)
somebody who doesn't hasn't played tcg (5:38 - 5:41)
in a real long time their ears probably (5:40 - 5:43)
perked up because they heard jungle (5:41 - 5:45)
uh i think a base at jungle pack goes (5:43 - 5:47)
for like 40 dollars (5:45 - 5:50)
more recently though hidden fates which (5:47 - 5:50)
has (5:50 - 5:52)
you know a bunch of shiny mewtwo shiny (5:50 - 5:53)
charizard and all that stuff (5:52 - 5:55)
uh i think a hidden fates pack goes for (5:53 - 5:57)
about twenty dollars and that pack came (5:55 - 5:58)
out (5:57 - 6:00)
last year i think the charizard from (5:58 - 6:02)
that set is (6:00 - 6:04)
close to seven hundred dollars hidden (6:02 - 6:06)
fates charizard i think is 700 (6:04 - 6:11)
people like charizard (6:06 - 6:11)
this is true this is not a lie (6:12 - 6:17)
as much as as much as people are like (6:15 - 6:18)
i'm so sick of charizard (6:17 - 6:22)
you are in the minority (6:18 - 6:25)
we hear you i mean but the rest of the (6:22 - 6:26)
world likes charizard (6:25 - 6:28)
i'm pretty sick of charizard pretty (6:26 - 6:29)
tired of charizard (6:28 - 6:32)
i think it's fine it's fine i am way (6:29 - 6:34)
more into pokemon masters (6:32 - 6:37)
venusaur with sigma suit leaf yeah she's (6:34 - 6:38)

that combo of janine (6:38 - 6:45)
and leaf poisoning and dropping their (6:42 - 6:46)
stats is my (6:45 - 6:50)
jam right now last bit of tcg news is (6:46 - 6:50)

they have plenty of them if you get an (7:27 - 7:33)
xy evolutions let me tell you (7:30 - 7:38)

does it come with uh a surface token (7:47 - 7:52)
thing (7:51 - 7:55)
no coin what it's (7:52 - 7:58)
yeah it's you know it's why buy this (7:55 - 7:58)
thing (7:58 - 8:01)
you want the oversized surface card (7:58 - 8:06)
but you can't use it (8:01 - 8:09)
i mean technically you can (8:06 - 8:09)

your deck pay no mind to the giant card (8:12 - 8:17)

just collecting dust (8:22 - 8:27)
i don't yeah i mean they don't fit into (8:25 - 8:29)
your binder because they keep making (8:27 - 8:30)
them different sizes i think we had a (8:29 - 8:32)
couple parents write in and just they (8:30 - 8:33)

here's my giant commander (8:44 - 8:49)
yeah nothing like that boo all right we (8:46 - 8:50)
have more pokemon news but we actually (8:49 - 8:52)
have a bunch of non-pokemon news this (8:50 - 8:54)
week that is related to pokemon in a way (8:52 - 8:55)
obviously i think um (8:54 - 8:57)
if there's switch or 3ds news i feel (8:55 - 8:58)
like (8:57 - 9:00)
the the consoles you play pokemon on are (8:58 - 9:02)
probably newsworthy for this show so (9:00 - 9:04)
we'll circle back to pokemon news (9:02 - 9:06)
uh we'll start with this article off (9:04 - 9:08)
euro game right (9:06 - 9:12)
nintendo 3ds officially discontinued (9:08 - 9:16)
what does that even mean (9:12 - 9:18)
the assembly line for it has shut down (9:16 - 9:20)
oh (9:18 - 9:23)
but what if i need like spare parts (9:20 - 9:26)
i'm sure this is store dot nintendo (9:23 - 9:28)
wait hold on back up what part are you (9:26 - 9:30)
playing (9:28 - 9:33)
uh like if the back cover where the (9:30 - 9:34)
covers the battery (9:33 - 9:36)
gets a scratch in it and i want a fresh (9:34 - 9:37)
one yeah (9:36 - 9:39)
yeah i'm sure i'm sure (9:37 - 9:41)
store.nintendoga.com is still selling (9:39 - 9:43)
replacement parts like if you lost your (9:41 - 9:45)
stock i will say (9:43 - 9:48)
there are so many wonderful things about (9:45 - 9:49)
the 3ds experience (9:48 - 9:52)
that have not been carried forward to (9:49 - 9:52)
the switch (9:52 - 9:56)
and that i do miss street pass (9:52 - 9:59)
what i got my mystery pass is after a (9:56 - 10:00)
night well street pass would have been (9:59 - 10:02)
useless this year i'll tell you that (10:00 - 10:02)
much (10:02 - 10:05)
look we cannot use this year as a basis (10:02 - 10:06)
for (10:05 - 10:08)
anything exactly everything was useless (10:06 - 10:09)
this year (10:08 - 10:12)
this year is a wash it's like saying (10:09 - 10:14)
well i never saw my friends (10:12 - 10:20)
so friendship was useless in 2020. (10:14 - 10:22)
you make you make a valid argument you (10:20 - 10:22)
know i can't (10:22 - 10:26)
[Laughter] (10:22 - 10:28)
i'm gonna move on for that after a nine (10:26 - 10:29)
year run (10:28 - 10:32)
uh more than 75 million units sold the (10:29 - 10:33)
nintendo has (10:32 - 10:36)
killed off the 3ds production has now (10:33 - 10:37)
ceased on all (10:36 - 10:39)
3ds hardware models including the new (10:37 - 10:40)
3ds uh (10:39 - 10:44)
and the new nintendo 2ds xl (10:40 - 10:46)
quote we can confirm that manufacturing (10:44 - 10:47)
of (10:46 - 10:49)
the nintendo 3ds family of systems have (10:47 - 10:51)
ended a nintendo spokesperson told our (10:49 - 10:53)
sister's site (10:51 - 10:55)
gameindustry.biz nintendo and (10:53 - 10:56)
third-party games (10:55 - 10:58)
for the nintendo 3ds of systems will (10:56 - 11:01)
continue to be available on the eshop (10:58 - 11:04)
nintendo.com and retail (11:01 - 11:07)
i just had a horrible realization this (11:04 - 11:08)
means that that (11:07 - 11:12)
really beautiful gold zernius 3ds (11:08 - 11:14)
from pokemon x and y will never be (11:12 - 11:15)
produced (11:14 - 11:19)
for you it is never coming (11:15 - 11:23)
i've been holding out hope for so long (11:19 - 11:26)
look as as we're all avid target (11:23 - 11:27)
shoppers (11:26 - 11:29)
the writing's been on the wall for what (11:27 - 11:31)
over two years when you look at the 3ds (11:29 - 11:32)
section and it's just like an end cap (11:31 - 11:36)
with pokemon mario animal crossing and (11:32 - 11:39)
that's it yeah i don't i can't even (11:36 - 11:42)
maybe okay watch (11:39 - 11:44)
maybe like the two copies of yokai watch (11:42 - 11:45)
that have been sitting there for two (11:44 - 11:47)
years that no one's bought yet (11:45 - 11:50)
yeah uh the existing library of more (11:47 - 11:51)
than eight (11:50 - 11:54)
a thousand nintendo 3ds games contain (11:51 - 11:55)
many critically acclaimed (11:54 - 11:58)
titles that can provide years of content (11:55 - 12:00)
to explore and enjoy (11:58 - 12:04)
there is no uh expectation that the 3ds (12:00 - 12:06)
eshop or online services will be (12:04 - 12:08)
effective in the near future (12:06 - 12:10)
which is probably the most important (12:08 - 12:11)
part here people are wondering if they (12:10 - 12:12)
can still (12:11 - 12:16)
street pass pss wonder trade (12:12 - 12:19)
etc uh last year we saw the arrival of (12:16 - 12:21)
the nintendo switch lite (12:19 - 12:25)
switch numbers are doing well 3ds was (12:21 - 12:28)
launched in japan back in february of (12:25 - 12:29)
2011. (12:28 - 12:32)
so it'd be 10 years old um in a couple (12:29 - 12:33)
months here (12:32 - 12:35)
uh europe one month later the (12:33 - 12:36)
long-awaited (12:35 - 12:38)
follow-up to the nintendo 3ds oh this is (12:36 - 12:40)
just explains that it did the 3d (12:38 - 12:44)
and we know what the 3ds did (12:40 - 12:47)
so the wii u was killed off pretty (12:44 - 12:47)
quickly (12:47 - 12:49)
they ceased production of the wii u (12:47 - 12:50)
relatively fast (12:49 - 12:54)
and um it's been over two years since (12:50 - 12:56)
they've produced a single wii u (12:54 - 12:59)
maybe even more than two years and their (12:56 - 13:00)
eshop (12:59 - 13:02)
and their online services are still up (13:00 - 13:03)
and running i (13:02 - 13:05)
i'm not mistaken you could still play (13:03 - 13:06)
smash brothers online pokken tournament (13:05 - 13:08)
online (13:06 - 13:11)
um and almost positive you can still buy (13:08 - 13:14)
mystery dungeon uh which is one of the (13:11 - 13:15)
virtual console games on the (13:14 - 13:18)
the wii u i haven't turned my wii u on (13:15 - 13:19)
in (13:18 - 13:22)
i don't know what four years so (13:19 - 13:24)
sure yeah it's been a while for me too (13:22 - 13:26)
but it's still plugged in (13:24 - 13:29)
i should probably unplug it from my (13:26 - 13:32)
my whole mess that's true i have it (13:29 - 13:32)
upstairs (13:32 - 13:35)
i have bayonetta 1 in bayonetta 2 on the (13:32 - 13:37)
wii u (13:35 - 13:38)
and it's like i kind of want to play (13:37 - 13:40)
those but also are they not out on (13:38 - 13:42)
switch (13:40 - 13:45)
i don't want to buy them again oh no but (13:42 - 13:46)
convenience (13:45 - 13:48)
look i've got katamari damasi used to (13:46 - 13:50)
play and monster hunter generations (13:48 - 13:52)
ultimate to play i don't need (13:50 - 13:55)
other games yeah i know what's (13:52 - 13:57)
probably the weirdest thing for anyone (13:55 - 13:59)
listening to the show would be (13:57 - 14:01)
no i guess it doesn't matter that much i (13:59 - 14:03)
was going to say what happens with (14:01 - 14:04)
pokemon bank (14:03 - 14:07)
because that would still need some sort (14:04 - 14:08)
of (14:07 - 14:10)
online i guess that's probably not (14:08 - 14:12)
dependent on nintendo servers (14:10 - 14:13)
right they would just have to keep the (14:12 - 14:15)
server running for banks specifically (14:13 - 14:18)
yeah i think that that's it's separate (14:15 - 14:20)
yeah i would imagine it's separate (14:18 - 14:22)
because like the web browser on the 3ds (14:20 - 14:23)
won't stop working (14:22 - 14:26)
uh netflix on the 3ds won't stop working (14:23 - 14:29)
is netflix on the 3ds there was some (14:26 - 14:33)
videos yeah netflix is on the 3ds (14:29 - 14:35)
i'm pretty sure it was i mean i (14:33 - 14:37)
downloaded it then realized why (14:35 - 14:41)
i only played my 3ds at home (14:37 - 14:41)
where i will have netflix on the big tv (14:41 - 14:48)
and the 3ds in my hand yeah you so you (14:45 - 14:50)
even in like diamond pearl black and (14:48 - 14:53)
white you can still trade (14:50 - 14:56)
locally you can still battle locally you (14:53 - 14:57)
just can't jump on (14:56 - 14:59)
look before somebody writes in being (14:57 - 15:01)
like there's a server i can yeah sure (14:59 - 15:01)
i'm (15:01 - 15:03)
there's some fan-made server you can i'm (15:01 - 15:05)
sure that works (15:03 - 15:06)
i'm not doubting it but the official (15:05 - 15:08)
nintendo servers are down for those so (15:06 - 15:09)
you can't (15:08 - 15:12)
wonder trade gts trade you know go (15:09 - 15:14)
online and try to find a japanese ditto (15:12 - 15:17)
so you can masuda breed and gen 4. (15:14 - 15:20)
but i am sure there's there are (15:17 - 15:21)
workarounds and there will be (15:20 - 15:22)
workarounds when the 3ds (15:21 - 15:24)
online goes off i just don't think it's (15:22 - 15:25)
going to be (15:24 - 15:30)
i think if they're gonna keep the wii u (15:25 - 15:31)
stuff open (15:30 - 15:34)
3ds is more than safe i think i think (15:31 - 15:35)
we're okay there i (15:34 - 15:37)
don't see it shutting down in the next (15:35 - 15:39)
year or two years honestly personally (15:37 - 15:41)
yeah probably not but three years all (15:39 - 15:42)
bets are off (15:41 - 15:45)
yeah yeah three years is a real long (15:42 - 15:46)
time for them to keep something up (15:45 - 15:48)
on the thing that hasn't been in (15:46 - 15:50)
production (15:48 - 15:51)
get a lot of news that came off (15:50 - 15:53)
september 25th (15:51 - 15:56)
here's some more news this is very very (15:53 - 15:57)
recent this is off game (15:56 - 16:00)
spot uh nintendo's switch (15:57 - 16:06)
successor will arrive before 2100 (16:00 - 16:06)
what what nintendo confirms (16:06 - 16:13)
it is working on new hardware but we (16:10 - 16:14)
only have the widest window for when it (16:13 - 16:17)
may be released (16:14 - 16:20)
what is this what is this article (16:17 - 16:24)
uh well i'll read it to you this should (16:20 - 16:27)
should surprise no one but nintendo is (16:24 - 16:28)
not going to exit the hardware business (16:27 - 16:29)
anytime soon (16:28 - 16:31)
as part of the company's latest (16:29 - 16:33)
corporate manager (16:31 - 16:35)
management briefing the firm revealed (16:33 - 16:38)
they are working on new hardware (16:35 - 16:39)
and it will be released before the end (16:38 - 16:42)
of the century (16:39 - 16:42)
nintendo confirms that the nintendo's (16:43 - 16:47)
next gaming system will launch (16:45 - 16:49)
sometime in 20xx that is what they said (16:47 - 16:51)
during the management briefing (16:49 - 16:54)
they said it will release 20xx (16:51 - 16:56)
realistically whenever the system ends (16:54 - 16:58)
up being it will surely release (16:56 - 16:59)
long before the end of the century (16:58 - 17:02)
nintendo is not committed to any dates (16:59 - 17:06)
uh we i mean (17:02 - 17:08)
we are scraping for news that that is (17:06 - 17:10)
literally the worst news article i've (17:08 - 17:14)
ever like it is look we've had (17:10 - 17:17)
bad news articles here (17:14 - 17:19)
we read bad news we cover bad this is a (17:17 - 17:21)
bad one this is a (17:19 - 17:25)
this is a good one in the sense that (17:21 - 17:28)
nintendo as of two days ago (17:25 - 17:30)
in a meeting said they are working on (17:28 - 17:32)
new hardware (17:30 - 17:34)
but this is obvious they're always (17:32 - 17:36)
working on new hardware until they (17:34 - 17:38)
say the only thing that is newsworthy is (17:36 - 17:39)
nintendo saying (17:38 - 17:41)
hey we're not going to do hardware (17:39 - 17:43)
anymore (17:41 - 17:45)
that's probably why just assume that (17:43 - 17:47)
we're doing hardware because that's why (17:45 - 17:50)
stick they announced pokemon sleep a (17:47 - 17:51)
year ago (17:50 - 17:53)
and that's not a thing i mean here's a (17:51 - 17:55)
news thing for you (17:53 - 17:58)
lakes announced we're still wet we are (17:55 - 18:00)
working on still being well i don't know (17:58 - 18:02)
i was over at cedar lake this morning it (18:00 - 18:04)
wasn't it wasn't you (18:02 - 18:08)
yeah little girl the new story (18:04 - 18:11)
is lakes are suddenly no longer wet (18:08 - 18:13)
that's when we start getting concerned (18:11 - 18:16)
not hey lakes are wet still are (18:13 - 18:18)
confirming that they're going to be wet (18:16 - 18:21)
there is the room (18:18 - 18:21)
there was the rumor from wall street (18:22 - 18:27)
journal (18:26 - 18:29)
that nintendo was working on a switch (18:27 - 18:30)
light and a switch (18:29 - 18:34)
pro that rumor came out at the same time (18:30 - 18:36)
like what i'm saying is the wall street (18:34 - 18:38)
journal reported both of those products (18:36 - 18:40)
in the same (18:38 - 18:44)
reporting one came true (18:40 - 18:46)
but the wall street journal also i (18:44 - 18:48)
believe if i'm (18:46 - 18:49)
remembering correctly i don't have it in (18:48 - 18:51)
front of me this was obviously before (18:49 - 18:52)
the switch light arrived (18:51 - 18:55)
they said that they wanted to release (18:52 - 18:56)
the switch light first for holiday and (18:55 - 18:58)
the switch pro would come later (18:56 - 19:02)
so if we're putting some tinfoil hats on (18:58 - 19:04)
the switch pro is still the thing (19:02 - 19:05)
they're probably working on (19:04 - 19:08)
right i mean they it they've they (19:05 - 19:09)
upgraded the game boy to the game boy (19:08 - 19:11)
pocket they upgraded the (19:09 - 19:14)
nintendo game boy advantage pocket or (19:11 - 19:16)
yeah sorry game boy to gameboy pocket (19:14 - 19:17)
game boy to game boy pocket was an (19:16 - 19:19)
upgrade right (19:17 - 19:22)
same system just a slim down yeah but (19:19 - 19:24)
it's still an upgrade (19:22 - 19:28)
you use batteries faster game boy color (19:24 - 19:29)
gameboy color is an upgrade i'll give (19:28 - 19:32)
you that game boy advance is a upgrade (19:29 - 19:34)
i'm not sure game boy pocket i mean i (19:32 - 19:35)
suppose if we're gonna can (19:34 - 19:37)
like i don't consider switch light and (19:35 - 19:39)
upgrade because they made it (19:37 - 19:42)
smaller and took the controllers off (19:39 - 19:43)
yeah (19:42 - 19:48)
i mean it's a lateral i suppose okay (19:43 - 19:51)
nintendo ds to the ds lite (19:48 - 19:54)
i guess that's not that's not (19:51 - 19:55)
i would say it's an upgrade because the (19:54 - 19:57)
battery life was better and you're not (19:55 - 19:59)
losing any features in the ds lite (19:57 - 20:01)
it's smaller no yeah the ds light was a (19:59 - 20:02)
much better system actually (20:01 - 20:05)
yes light was much better than that did (20:02 - 20:06)
they fix the screen (20:05 - 20:10)
light problem um like it was a little (20:06 - 20:11)
bit brighter and didn't eat your battery (20:10 - 20:13)
at an atrocious yeah the battery was (20:11 - 20:15)
better and then the screen was better (20:13 - 20:16)
but the hinge was bad (20:15 - 20:18)
because the hinges would crack look they (20:16 - 20:20)
had to get they had to cut somewhere (20:18 - 20:21)
they're going to cut on your hinges (20:20 - 20:23)
so then it was the ds the ds light to (20:21 - 20:25)
the dsi (20:23 - 20:27)
which was an upgrade because that was a (20:25 - 20:29)
processor upgrade (20:27 - 20:32)
and then the dsi xl and then we had the (20:29 - 20:34)
3ds to the new 3ds so that was a (20:32 - 20:35)
processor upgrade (20:34 - 20:38)
so i don't see why we wouldn't get like (20:35 - 20:39)
the switch pro (20:38 - 20:42)
and get the processor upgrade i mean (20:39 - 20:44)
they don't really need to move on from (20:42 - 20:46)
the switch it's doing pretty well (20:44 - 20:49)
doing really well i think i think the (20:46 - 20:51)
switch pro is still probably in the (20:49 - 20:53)
in the cards we'll end up buying it if (20:51 - 20:54)
it comes out (20:53 - 20:57)
yep cause we're fools well if it's (20:54 - 21:00)
if it's an actual upgrade it depends on (20:57 - 21:01)
how big of an upgrade it is (21:00 - 21:03)
also depends if there's a pokemon (21:01 - 21:05)
special edition of it because much like (21:03 - 21:07)
all the other upgrades i didn't buy it (21:05 - 21:10)
until there was an actual (21:07 - 21:12)
special version because i usually the (21:10 - 21:14)
upgrades aren't worth it (21:12 - 21:17)
i don't regret upgrading to a new 3ds (21:14 - 21:19)
i don't think i saw a benefit from it (21:17 - 21:22)
but i don't think i regret it i mean (21:19 - 21:23)
you got to play the games that only (21:22 - 21:25)
played on the new 3ds yeah (21:23 - 21:27)
what i don't think i played any of those (21:25 - 21:29)
games (21:27 - 21:31)
xenoblade was one of them right i don't (21:29 - 21:32)
remember (21:31 - 21:33)
there was always a hunter generation (21:32 - 21:36)
yeah i think you could play that on both (21:33 - 21:38)
i just think it ran like garbage on the (21:36 - 21:40)
original one (21:38 - 21:42)
i was very happy holding off until i got (21:40 - 21:44)
my pokemon special version (21:42 - 21:46)
and then i then i bought it i did not to (21:44 - 21:47)
get it (21:46 - 21:48)
i didn't need to get it right away (21:47 - 21:50)
because just the upgrades like the (21:48 - 21:51)
upgrades were not worth (21:50 - 21:55)
buying another 400 console (21:51 - 21:58)
i can't remember like how many 3ds's i (21:55 - 21:59)
bought but i think it's like (21:58 - 22:02)
ultimately like of all types of 3ds (21:59 - 22:06)
probably four or five oh (22:02 - 22:09)
i like i know i have four 3ds somewhere (22:06 - 22:09)
in this (22:09 - 22:14)
house oh my gosh i see (22:09 - 22:17)
i see four 3ds on my no i see (22:14 - 22:21)
three 3ds's on my desk and one ds (22:17 - 22:23)
which is a pink one from gamestop that i (22:21 - 22:25)
ordered a white one and they sent me a (22:23 - 22:27)
pink one but it's an okay pink so (22:25 - 22:30)
and the pink was good no yeah my pink (22:27 - 22:31)
diaz (22:30 - 22:33)
got used so bad that it that the hinge (22:31 - 22:35)
finally broke and i was like well it's (22:33 - 22:37)
actually the end of this console and (22:35 - 22:39)
i've been on the 3ds for a while so (22:37 - 22:41)
going to get this fixed we'll get back (22:39 - 22:44)
to pokemon news we got a oh gosh (22:41 - 22:46)
i think this might be the worst this (22:44 - 22:47)
might be the worst news article of the (22:46 - 22:49)
show but we gotta take a break (22:47 - 22:55)
we'll be right back we can skip it (22:49 - 22:57)
stop going to sam's club stop buying the (22:55 - 22:59)
four gallon tub of peanut butter (22:57 - 23:01)
but sam's cup has some really good deals (22:59 - 23:02)
stop stop (23:01 - 23:06)
stop going to sandpaper the 18 pounds of (23:02 - 23:08)
cream cheese is on sale (23:06 - 23:10)
[Music] (23:08 - 23:19)
the 18 pounds of cream cheese is on sale (23:10 - 23:23)
somehow you can't eat 18 pounds of cream (23:19 - 23:37)
cheese before they expired (23:23 - 23:43)
[Music] (23:37 - 23:43)
we are back the suspense all right this (23:44 - 23:50)
was sent in by andy (23:47 - 23:50)
i'm already angry no fault to andy not (23:53 - 23:58)
andy's fault andy is just the messenger (23:57 - 23:59)
here (23:58 - 24:02)
it doesn't matter and i andy gets into (23:59 - 24:03)
trouble a lot (24:02 - 24:06)
so i a i'm surprised that this wasn't (24:03 - 24:07)
typoed (24:06 - 24:10)
b andy come on (24:07 - 24:13)
this is off my nintendo news (24:10 - 24:15)
i really only just have to read the (24:13 - 24:17)
headline because there is no content to (24:15 - 24:19)
follow (24:17 - 24:22)
nintendo has applied for pokemon heart (24:19 - 24:23)
gold (24:22 - 24:26)
and pokemon soul silver trademarks oh (24:23 - 24:29)
well remakes confirmed (24:26 - 24:32)
the article is literally two paragraphs (24:29 - 24:33)
it's at most (24:32 - 24:36)
ten sentences i i'm sure there are (24:33 - 24:36)
people (24:36 - 24:40)
that are jumping for joy (24:36 - 24:43)
they're like yes this is the moment (24:40 - 24:43)
but do you think there's like somebody (24:44 - 24:48)
over at game freak (24:46 - 24:51)
and they're like hey frank we got some (24:48 - 24:52)
trademarks expiring (24:51 - 24:56)
what do we got on the docket uh it's (24:52 - 24:58)
just a bunch of pokemon stuff (24:56 - 25:00)
yeah let's not renew them i don't think (24:58 - 25:02)
that series is doing well let's (25:00 - 25:04)
just let them expire we don't want to (25:02 - 25:06)
waste the 50 bucks to (25:04 - 25:09)
renew the trade like that conversation (25:06 - 25:10)
didn't happen (25:09 - 25:14)
right because like why (25:10 - 25:16)
would the pokemon i can't even think of (25:14 - 25:17)
anything the pokemon company at this (25:16 - 25:19)
point would let expire (25:17 - 25:22)
maybe pokemon duel maybe the pokemon (25:19 - 25:24)
dual trademark comes up (25:22 - 25:26)
yeah they might like do we'll go no but (25:24 - 25:28)
there's multiple dual games and i can (25:26 - 25:28)
let that go (25:28 - 25:30)
yeah that's probably true they put yeah (25:28 - 25:32)
i mean it's it's like (25:30 - 25:34)
if you if you have owned anything on (25:32 - 25:35)
godaddy (25:34 - 25:39)
and you have like you own like (25:35 - 25:44)
big bootysquirrel.com (25:39 - 25:44)
you're like like i don't plan on doing (25:47 - 25:51)
anything with this but if there's the (25:49 - 25:52)
smallest (25:51 - 25:55)
chance you're like man big booty (25:52 - 25:56)
squirrel might have it not not (25:55 - 25:58)
this year not next year but in the next (25:56 - 26:00)
five years i'm gonna make some (25:58 - 26:01)
then you just renew it you just pay (26:00 - 26:04)
godaddy the 11.99 and you just renew it (26:01 - 26:05)
you forget about it for a year (26:04 - 26:07)
there's like no way they would ever let (26:05 - 26:09)
these trademarks expire (26:07 - 26:11)
it's not really news i don't know why i (26:09 - 26:14)
went with that domain (26:11 - 26:15)
i don't know why that was the first (26:14 - 26:17)
thing that came to mind (26:15 - 26:18)
yeah there's i don't think there's any (26:17 - 26:21)
news here but i mean is this (26:18 - 26:24)
did it say renewed the trademark or did (26:21 - 26:25)
it say (26:24 - 26:27)
trademarked it for the first time no it (26:25 - 26:28)
renewed it (26:27 - 26:30)
but that's even worse and so the trade (26:28 - 26:31)
the trademark does cover (26:30 - 26:33)
other things besides the video games (26:31 - 26:34)
right it would consider it would it (26:33 - 26:36)
would also cover like (26:34 - 26:38)
um the anime any merchandise it would (26:36 - 26:40)
cover any any publication (26:38 - 26:43)
any promotion anything right yes any any (26:40 - 26:44)
of the tcg (26:43 - 26:46)
cards so if they ever wanted to reprint (26:44 - 26:48)
you know dauntless or whatever (26:46 - 26:51)
unleashed whatever tcg stuff the (26:48 - 26:52)
trademark would apply to that too (26:51 - 26:54)
so what what what i don't even know what (26:52 - 26:55)
trademark law (26:54 - 26:58)
in japan is is it like every 20 years 10 (26:55 - 26:59)
years i'm not sure (26:58 - 27:02)
i'm not a japanese lawyer yeah (26:59 - 27:04)
yeah i'm not a no one sure when they (27:02 - 27:06)
have to renew those (27:04 - 27:07)
and then of course it would like if (27:06 - 27:10)
international trademark law would apply (27:07 - 27:13)
so that's a whole other kettle of fish (27:10 - 27:14)

yeah okay where do you look for teams in (30:26 - 30:30)
this (30:29 - 30:34)
god stop talking to me leah oh yeah i (30:30 - 30:36)
remember why i stopped playing this game (30:34 - 30:38)
horizontal (30:36 - 30:42)
oh we are not having this conversation (30:38 - 30:48)
oh that's why i forgot it was horizontal (30:42 - 30:51)
i remember why search (30:48 - 30:55)
search by team name p k (30:51 - 30:59)
m n 12 out of 30 members spelled (30:55 - 31:03)
capital p capital k capital m capital n (30:59 - 31:06)
capital c you can't join asd i can't (31:03 - 31:09)
join i need i need lower casey (31:06 - 31:11)
gotta spell the brand right that's the (31:09 - 31:12)
fake brand maybe they can (31:11 - 31:14)
i don't know if they can like not change (31:12 - 31:16)
the name afterwards (31:14 - 31:18)
i don't know are you saying you're going (31:16 - 31:20)
to start a rifle (31:18 - 31:24)
brand well the real brand is lowercase (31:20 - 31:27)

you can't you can't let that go i can't (31:34 - 31:38)
it's (31:37 - 31:40)
i i can't say that you can't let it go (31:38 - 31:42)
that it's horizontal (31:40 - 31:44)

recording zapdos is now available (32:35 - 32:38)
currently (32:37 - 32:41)
and then um starting on october 2nd (32:38 - 32:43)
mall trace will appear for a week and (32:41 - 32:45)
then from (32:43 - 32:47)
for two weeks after mult race from (32:45 - 32:49)
october 9 through october 23rd (32:47 - 32:52)
origin form giratina as the one that (32:49 - 32:55)
looks like the worm will be available (32:52 - 32:57)
and this will be the first time it will (32:55 - 32:59)
be shiny what's the other form called (32:57 - 33:03)
origin form and dauntless i don't know (32:59 - 33:03)
no (33:03 - 33:07)
wait wait wait wait wait wait no (33:03 - 33:10)
origin and i want to say because it's (33:07 - 33:11)
distortion world (33:10 - 33:15)
yeah is it (33:11 - 33:18)
normal form no isn't it just giratina (33:15 - 33:21)
it's just no i think it has a forum name (33:18 - 33:21)
why (33:21 - 33:25)
why would the hard questions uh is it (33:21 - 33:28)
altered form alternative altered form (33:25 - 33:30)
altered form altered form and origin (33:28 - 33:32)
form this is the first time that origin (33:30 - 33:34)
form again the one that looks like the (33:32 - 33:35)
worm (33:34 - 33:38)
will be able to be shiny although i (33:35 - 33:39)
think the (33:38 - 33:43)
altered form is better for like pvp but (33:39 - 33:46)
i'm sure if you if you like if you like (33:43 - 33:48)
pvp and pokemon go first off i'm sorry (33:46 - 33:51)
second off well look pvp would be fine (33:48 - 33:53)
if niantic can fix it (33:51 - 33:54)
and every time they seem to fix it (33:53 - 33:56)
another issue seems to pop up (33:54 - 33:58)
but i don't even know i just play it so (33:56 - 33:59)
little i don't even know what's (33:58 - 34:01)
currently wrong with it i just don't (33:59 - 34:02)
enjoy it (34:01 - 34:03)
i don't remember the current it's very (34:02 - 34:05)
hard to keep up with what's (34:03 - 34:08)
actually broken (34:05 - 34:10)
if you do play pvp you already know this (34:08 - 34:11)
i'm pretty sure the altered form is (34:10 - 34:12)
better (34:11 - 34:15)
than origin form in pvp i could be wrong (34:12 - 34:16)
on that (34:15 - 34:19)
we don't know what's happening after (34:16 - 34:21)
october 23rd (34:19 - 34:23)
i don't know something spooky i'm gonna (34:21 - 34:24)
say dar cry (34:23 - 34:27)
uh that's my guess why not i guess (34:24 - 34:28)
yeah but they don't know we don't know (34:27 - 34:30)
what's happening over halloween the (34:28 - 34:32)
spotlight hours are (34:30 - 34:35)
changing uh every tuesday from 6 p.m one (34:32 - 34:37)
hour spotlight bonus first will be (34:35 - 34:40)
world cap pikachu in spotlight (34:37 - 34:42)
which one's world cup world cap is the (34:40 - 34:44)
one from journeys (34:42 - 34:47)
so this is a brand new pikachu it's a (34:44 - 34:48)
brand new world we live (34:47 - 34:51)
in not even this that is the right song (34:48 - 34:53)
yeah don't that's not how it goes (34:51 - 34:57)
so that's october 6 on october 23rd it (34:53 - 34:57)
will be (34:57 - 35:01)
origin cap pikachu that is the original (34:57 - 35:02)
ash hat (35:01 - 35:05)
the triangle symbol i believe yep that (35:02 - 35:06)
one can be shiny (35:05 - 35:08)
uh and then we have uh tuesday october (35:06 - 35:10)
20th which is shepit (35:08 - 35:12)
and then tuesday october 27th which is (35:10 - 35:13)
duskull (35:12 - 35:15)
and then the bonuses here is with the (35:13 - 35:17)
world cap you get double the xp for (35:15 - 35:18)
catching (35:17 - 35:20)
the origin cap you get twice as many (35:18 - 35:21)
candy (35:20 - 35:24)
the shop it you will get double transfer (35:21 - 35:26)
candy that's a very good one (35:24 - 35:27)
even if you don't care about getting (35:26 - 35:29)
shut it good time to transfer all your (35:27 - 35:30)
pokemon (35:29 - 35:33)
and then um duskol is twice xp for (35:30 - 35:35)
evolving so these are every tuesday (35:33 - 35:37)
they're an hour long (35:35 - 35:40)
i'm going to probably say that the (35:37 - 35:42)
worldcat pikachu probably won't be shiny (35:40 - 35:45)
because they didn't specifically say (35:42 - 35:47)
there's only one pokemon they've turned (35:45 - 35:49)
chinese off for (35:47 - 35:52)
and that was meltan that i remember that (35:49 - 35:53)
wasn't an accident that wasn't an (35:52 - 35:54)
accident i know they've accidentally (35:53 - 35:57)
turned off chinese (35:54 - 35:57)
but original cat pikachu can be shiny so (35:57 - 36:00)
they don't have to state that they (35:59 - 36:02)
usually don't state (36:00 - 36:04)
usually don't state when a pokemon is (36:02 - 36:07)
already shiny that it can be shiny again (36:04 - 36:09)
but normally when they introduce a new (36:07 - 36:11)
pokemon (36:09 - 36:12)
and they don't state that it's shiny (36:11 - 36:14)
then it's not shiny (36:12 - 36:16)
so i'm assuming the world cat pikachu (36:14 - 36:18)
won't be shiny but it's it's first time (36:16 - 36:19)
and (36:18 - 36:22)
you know niantic you gotta release it (36:19 - 36:23)
the first time then release it the (36:22 - 36:25)
second time with the exclusive move and (36:23 - 36:26)
then release it the third time a shiny (36:25 - 36:28)
and then release it the fourth time (36:26 - 36:30)
shiny with the exclusive move (36:28 - 36:33)
extend the life of our product (36:30 - 36:34)
there are very vocal people that don't (36:33 - 36:37)
like the hats i don't i don't i (36:34 - 36:40)
that's fine i don't they're just they're (36:37 - 36:41)
boring (36:40 - 36:43)
it's something to collect it's something (36:41 - 36:44)
to collect (36:43 - 36:47)
period end of sentence (36:44 - 36:50)
there's no more there's no more to that (36:47 - 36:51)
sentence it is something to collect (36:50 - 36:55)
i think that i like the hats i'm not (36:51 - 36:57)
super upset i i think probably their (36:55 - 36:58)
problem the problem (36:57 - 37:02)
the probability of the argument is is (36:58 - 37:05)
the hats take up other spawns (37:02 - 37:08)
i'm assuming is why they would be upset (37:05 - 37:09)
it's like oh it's a happy pikachu and (37:08 - 37:10)
it's not a (37:09 - 37:17)
execute all i have is a huge sigh i just (37:10 - 37:17)
we have limited design space for spawns (37:18 - 37:23)
and now you're just throwing in another (37:21 - 37:24)
hat (37:23 - 37:28)
mouse and we still don't have (37:24 - 37:31)
all the ones that are missing i don't (37:28 - 37:33)
want to hear about no keklia (37:31 - 37:36)
why it's still missing keglian and (37:33 - 37:38)
world cat pikachu probably on the same (37:36 - 37:39)
pedestal (37:38 - 37:41)
you catch one of them you complete your (37:39 - 37:43)
deck so you'll never use it for anything (37:41 - 37:43)
again (37:43 - 37:46)
yup give me my kecklion and then keclam (37:43 - 37:48)
will go back to being forgotten about (37:46 - 37:49)
forever (37:48 - 37:51)
just like smeargle is the last time (37:49 - 37:52)
somebody boot up their phone to take a (37:51 - 37:56)
picture to get some miracle to appear (37:52 - 37:58)

14 hours of meowth (38:39 - 38:44)
uh i could do some more gallery meowths (38:42 - 38:46)
i don't think i have enough i think i'm (38:44 - 38:46)
a couple (38:46 - 38:49)
candies short for berserker oh (38:46 - 38:53)
wait does it evolve yeah i don't see why (38:49 - 38:55)
it wouldn't i i have egged so many of (38:53 - 38:56)
those things (38:55 - 38:58)
oh wait i don't know there's not like (38:56 - 39:01)
gallerian meowth candy (38:58 - 39:01)
never mind i have so much meowth candy (39:03 - 39:08)
we know two of those can be shiny we (39:06 - 39:11)
know that canto analomous can be shiny (39:08 - 39:13)
don't know about galler probably not (39:11 - 39:14)
again they didn't state (39:13 - 39:17)
so probably not there's the fashion (39:14 - 39:19)
themed event that will start on october (39:17 - 39:20)
2nd through (39:19 - 39:23)
october 8th which we should actually (39:20 - 39:24)
probably talk about (39:23 - 39:27)
and then finally um october is (39:24 - 39:30)
uh has a lot more halloween you can (39:27 - 39:31)
expect new avatar (39:30 - 39:34)
a new halloween cup which i don't think (39:31 - 39:36)
got delayed slash cancelled because the (39:34 - 39:38)
flying cup did (39:36 - 39:40)
i don't the halloween one did yet (39:38 - 39:41)
probably will get cancelled (39:40 - 39:43)
uh there will also be an event (39:41 - 39:45)
celebrating niantic's anniversary and (39:43 - 39:46)
the (39:45 - 39:50)
changing of seasons ooh (39:46 - 39:55)
does that mean deerling fortuitous or (39:50 - 39:55)
smashbox (39:55 - 39:59)
be aware of your surroundings okay so i (39:56 - 40:01)
don't maybe i'm reading too much into (39:59 - 40:03)
that or maybe seasons or (40:01 - 40:06)
seasons would apply dearly for sure yeah (40:03 - 40:07)
it's weird as they would call out (40:06 - 40:10)
changing of seasons and not have that (40:07 - 40:12)
be something well especially because (40:10 - 40:15)
they're in the unova pokemon right now (40:12 - 40:18)
right yeah and i'm assuming we would (40:15 - 40:20)
start getting (40:18 - 40:22)
we would start getting probably kalos (40:20 - 40:24)
pokemon early next year (40:22 - 40:27)
so they kind of gotta kind of get them (40:24 - 40:29)
push out the last like 14 that we're (40:27 - 40:31)
missing or whatever (40:29 - 40:33)
they haven't pushed out the last ones (40:31 - 40:34)
for everything (40:33 - 40:39)
okay exactly have a fun with long champ (40:34 - 40:42)
and pokemon collaboration arriving soon (40:39 - 40:45)
in celebration in celebration of (40:42 - 40:46)
accessories (40:45 - 40:48)
coming between the pokemon company and (40:46 - 40:50)
long champ (40:48 - 40:53)
what is long champ will never (40:50 - 40:55)
never heard of it you are my fashion (40:53 - 40:58)
connection non-american coach (40:55 - 41:00)
i would say if i am your fashion (40:58 - 41:02)
connection you really (41:00 - 41:05)
need to reevaluate your life choices (41:02 - 41:07)
if it's not made by a skateboard company (41:05 - 41:09)
it barely graces my (41:07 - 41:12)
skin come on now you are all about the (41:09 - 41:14)
fashion masks so (41:12 - 41:16)
oh that is true but they don't fit very (41:14 - 41:18)
well let's be real (41:16 - 41:20)
you're far more into the fashion than i (41:18 - 41:22)
am pretty sure (41:20 - 41:24)
i did the conversion right i went to (41:22 - 41:25)
long champ's website (41:24 - 41:27)
they do they did not have the pokemon (41:25 - 41:29)
bags for sale (41:27 - 41:31)
but they did have their own bags for (41:29 - 41:35)
sale and they were 600 euros (41:31 - 41:38)
uh which is the equivalent to 700 (41:35 - 41:42)
usd and also being a french company it's (41:38 - 41:43)
not (41:42 - 41:50)
long champ it's a long charm (41:43 - 41:50)
the pokemon company and long champ paris (41:50 - 41:59)
beginning of the paris fashion week (41:55 - 41:59)
i think that sentence gives it away (41:59 - 42:03)
parish paris fashion week (42:01 - 42:05)
i don't think like forever 21 is showing (42:03 - 42:07)
up at like paris fashion week right (42:05 - 42:09)
you're not getting like a 14 (42:07 - 42:12)
t-shirt typically the fashion weeks (42:09 - 42:16)
are individual designers not yeah yeah (42:12 - 42:18)

hatching from eggs (42:26 - 42:30)

appearing in raids it will also know the (42:43 - 42:47)
exclusive move draining kiss (42:45 - 42:48)

to evolve it assuming you could (42:48 - 42:53)
shinks will be wearing a top hat and (42:51 - 42:55)
appearing in raids (42:53 - 42:57)
crow gunk will be wearing a backwards (42:55 - 42:59)

snapshot as a surprise encounter they (42:59 - 43:03)
will all (43:02 - 43:07)
they will rarely appear in the wild i'm (43:03 - 43:08)
assuming with that sentence (43:07 - 43:10)
shinks and curlio will not be appearing (43:08 - 43:11)
in the wild because they didn't state (43:10 - 43:12)
that (43:11 - 43:14)
uh the following pokemon appearing in (43:12 - 43:16)
the wild will be (43:14 - 43:18)
my reap i don't know why i said maureep (43:16 - 43:19)
so funny (43:18 - 43:22)
skitty rosalia (43:19 - 43:25)
crow gunk wearing the backwards cap (43:22 - 43:25)
which (43:25 - 43:27)
they just said in the sentence before (43:25 - 43:29)
will rarely appear blitzel cottony (43:27 - 43:32)
mincino and gothita and more (43:29 - 43:34)
if you're lucky trainers you may (43:32 - 43:36)
encounter a shiny cricket (43:34 - 43:40)
you can enjoy exclusive field research (43:36 - 43:43)
and dress up for fashion week in person (43:40 - 43:45)
and in game be sure to head (43:43 - 43:49)
to the shop for a free long long chomp (43:45 - 43:53)
avatar item in pokemon go then (43:49 - 43:55)
match your trainer avatar by picking the (43:53 - 43:56)
same (43:55 - 43:59)
long champ item in store no okay (43:56 - 44:01)
for more information please visit their (43:59 - 44:02)
website uh (44:01 - 44:06)
and okay so a couple things from this (44:02 - 44:08)
i just searched longchamp they do sell (44:06 - 44:09)
long champ stuff at nordstrom it looks (44:08 - 44:12)
like like a hand purse is like 145. (44:09 - 44:15)
this yeah about 145. (44:12 - 44:18)
they are going to sell like pokemon (44:15 - 44:19)
purses (44:18 - 44:21)
so uh so it's not a it's not a deal (44:19 - 44:22)
between niantic (44:21 - 44:25)
and long champ deal between the pokemon (44:22 - 44:27)
company and long champ (44:25 - 44:29)
so the real question is how much did (44:27 - 44:30)
longchamp (44:29 - 44:33)
pay the pokemon company to get their (44:30 - 44:34)
items (44:33 - 44:37)
in game and to get an event like (44:34 - 44:40)
but also why would long chant like is (44:37 - 44:42)
there that big of a crossover between (44:40 - 44:45)
pokemon go players and purses or (44:42 - 44:46)
handbags (44:45 - 44:48)
like these are these are pretty (44:46 - 44:51)
expensive handbags (44:48 - 44:51)
under a thousand dollars we're not (44:52 - 44:55)
talking yeah expensive for a handbag (44:53 - 44:56)
dude (44:55 - 44:58)
no i've been there and they are they're (44:56 - 45:00)
approaching high-end end bag (44:58 - 45:03)
uh high-end bag prices but they're like (45:00 - 45:04)
the same prices like (45:03 - 45:06)
coach and i would say coach is a step up (45:04 - 45:08)
from like you know just going to target (45:06 - 45:11)
uh coach bag for 125 dollars you can fit (45:08 - 45:14)
like a quarter in it (45:11 - 45:14)
are you saying coach bags are more well (45:14 - 45:18)
look i said there i (45:16 - 45:20)
did google search 125 for a handbag i (45:18 - 45:22)
don't know how big that handbag is (45:20 - 45:25)
from nordstrom this could be last year's (45:22 - 45:26)
model (45:25 - 45:27)
uh this bag is pretty big actually oh (45:26 - 45:29)
it's not leather though this is a cloth (45:27 - 45:31)
this is that's that's important yeah (45:29 - 45:33)
this is where you go this is a cloth (45:31 - 45:35)
handbag for 145. (45:33 - 45:38)
i mean i'm looking at coach right now (45:35 - 45:43)
and a clutch is 375 dollars oh you got (45:38 - 45:43)
to go (45:43 - 45:46)
you got to go to the car is that koi (45:43 - 45:47)
perks because the clutch (45:46 - 45:50)
is nothing a clutch (45:47 - 45:53)
holds barely your basics so (45:50 - 45:56)
yeah the lowest price bag i can find (45:53 - 46:00)
on the coach site is what they call (45:56 - 46:02)
a belt bag what the rest of the world (46:00 - 46:04)
calls a fanny pack (46:02 - 46:09)
yep for 122 dollars (46:04 - 46:13)
yeah okay i bought long champ's website (46:09 - 46:16)
function we'll do men's business bags (46:13 - 46:17)
here (46:16 - 46:19)
where i don't think any of us are in the (46:17 - 46:21)
department in the field for (46:19 - 46:23)
a hand purse so if we're gonna if we're (46:21 - 46:26)
gonna look at like let's say (46:23 - 46:29)
a backpack let's look at a backpack (46:26 - 46:34)
a plain old longshot backpack is 395 (46:29 - 46:37)
one of the fancy u-shaped ones that (46:34 - 46:38)
looks (46:37 - 46:41)
you know cute is 640. like they've done (46:38 - 46:43)
fancy stuff before the pokemon company (46:41 - 46:44)
has done fancy stuff before they've done (46:43 - 46:46)
wedding rings they've done well (46:44 - 46:47)
their wedding rings weren't exactly that (46:46 - 46:51)
fancy but they have worked with like (46:47 - 46:54)
designer brains before yeah (46:51 - 46:56)
this seems like one of the more (46:54 - 46:58)
expensive ones i mean it's up there but (46:56 - 47:01)
i mean they make what there's people out (46:58 - 47:02)
there who pay (47:01 - 47:05)
a lot of money for their pokemon go (47:02 - 47:08)
stuff yeah no i don't i don't doubt that (47:05 - 47:09)
people who (47:08 - 47:12)
have heard of long trump and who (47:09 - 47:17)
have for us lonely streamers who barely (47:12 - 47:17)
make any money (47:17 - 47:20)
a thousand dollar backpack out of the (47:17 - 47:21)
budget right (47:20 - 47:25)
yep yes i and i don't even know if (47:21 - 47:27)
i've only seen a couple screenshots of (47:25 - 47:28)
the pokemon stuff and i only saw like (47:27 - 47:29)
purses so i'm not in the department for (47:28 - 47:30)
a purse (47:29 - 47:31)
so i i don't know if they're making a (47:30 - 47:33)
pokemon backpack or i would want the (47:31 - 47:35)
pokemon backpack but i would also assume (47:33 - 47:35)
that would be (47:35 - 47:37)
anywhere between like 600 to a thousand (47:35 - 47:39)
dollars (47:37 - 47:41)
but it doesn't seem like long champ (47:39 - 47:42)
would have to (47:41 - 47:45)
advertise in pokemon go to move this (47:42 - 47:46)
merchandise (47:45 - 47:49)
i mean i can't even get a basic black (47:46 - 47:51)
briefcase off their website because it's (47:49 - 47:53)
sold out so like i don't (47:51 - 47:55)
it doesn't like it doesn't seem like (47:53 - 47:56)
they have a problem selling their own (47:55 - 47:57)
merch to (47:56 - 47:59)
the very like to their audience they (47:57 - 48:00)
probably know their audience very well (47:59 - 48:02)
and what they want to pay for what they (48:00 - 48:03)
want to buy (48:02 - 48:07)
so i i i don't know what they (48:03 - 48:09)
like i can't imagine that the pokemon (48:07 - 48:10)
character overthinking it i (48:09 - 48:12)
i yeah one one of them reached out to (48:10 - 48:14)
the other and said hey let's do a (48:12 - 48:14)
crossover (48:14 - 48:16)
and they're like yeah that's chill let's (48:14 - 48:17)
have some fun (48:16 - 48:20)
and there you go it's not about dollars (48:17 - 48:21)
and cents in this (48:20 - 48:24)
i mean here's the thing if (48:21 - 48:26)
if longshot wants to go into lower end (48:24 - 48:29)
products or they want to get into (48:26 - 48:31)
other areas these are great ways for (48:29 - 48:33)
them to get brand recognition (48:31 - 48:35)
like even if you can't afford it now (48:33 - 48:37)
let's say they want to release (48:35 - 48:40)
a low end line into target or (48:37 - 48:43)
into other department stores like macy's (48:40 - 48:47)
this this builds more just (48:43 - 48:49)
general oh i've heard of them before it (48:47 - 48:52)
also just makes them seem like oh this (48:49 - 48:52)
is fun (48:52 - 48:55)
it gives niantic something unique and (48:52 - 48:56)
special (48:55 - 49:00)
it gives both at least name recognition (48:56 - 49:02)
between two separate audiences (49:00 - 49:04)
it doesn't really matter what they sell (49:02 - 49:06)
because both are going to sell to x (49:04 - 49:08)
amount of people who want to buy them (49:06 - 49:08)
they (49:08 - 49:11)
are immediate high-end collectors items (49:08 - 49:12)
like i (49:11 - 49:15)
there was no reason for pokemon to have (49:12 - 49:16)
a fossil watch (49:15 - 49:19)
yet there it was and yet i bought it (49:16 - 49:21)
like fossil was selling just fine back (49:19 - 49:22)
in the day (49:21 - 49:26)
but it just it just adds a unique thing (49:22 - 49:28)
that people can buy who already (49:26 - 49:30)
know that brand and like that brand and (49:28 - 49:32)
spreads the word about that brand in a (49:30 - 49:34)
fun way (49:32 - 49:35)
i'm not i'm not saying pokemon fans are (49:34 - 49:37)
cheap i mean they're going around buying (49:35 - 49:40)
two thousand dollar charizards (49:37 - 49:40)
but you i think you're also very focused (49:42 - 49:45)
on like the (49:44 - 49:48)
us pokemon go player market the the (49:45 - 49:50)
japanese pokemon go player market may be (49:48 - 49:53)
completely different right yeah no (49:50 - 49:55)
that is that is true well i mean for (49:53 - 49:57)
this show it's it makes sense for us to (49:55 - 49:58)
focus on the us because (49:57 - 50:00)
i i mean i know how many people listen (49:58 - 50:02)
to japan it's not it's not a lot our (50:00 - 50:03)
biggest (50:02 - 50:05)
audience i'm just saying the long shot (50:03 - 50:06)
crossover (50:05 - 50:08)
might be oriented towards their japanese (50:06 - 50:10)
audience where (50:08 - 50:13)
you know fashion in japan is x levels up (50:10 - 50:16)
what we would normally put on our bodies (50:13 - 50:19)
yeah i mean even if you had the money to (50:16 - 50:21)
afford these pokemon bags whenever they (50:19 - 50:21)
arrive (50:21 - 50:24)
i'm sure they will sell out very quickly (50:21 - 50:27)
that i i don't doubt i mean look at the (50:24 - 50:30)
200 those skateboards were 250 bucks (50:27 - 50:32)
they sell that instantly yeah they sell (50:30 - 50:34)
out like if you did not (50:32 - 50:35)
law if you were not waiting for the (50:34 - 50:37)
email of like where they're in stock (50:35 - 50:40)
like they were gone and i don't know how (50:37 - 50:42)
many of each skateboard they had but you (50:40 - 50:43)
saw the picture they made a lot of them (50:42 - 50:45)
they made a lot of them or they (50:43 - 50:46)
photoshopped a lot of them in (50:45 - 50:49)
guess who's getting one for christmas (50:46 - 50:50)
did you order one (50:49 - 50:52)
no i'm not allowed to spend money on (50:50 - 50:55)
tuesdays i'm only allowed to (50:52 - 50:58)
mention things that come out on tuesdays (50:55 - 51:00)
to other people who might want to spend (50:58 - 51:01)
money on me (51:00 - 51:04)
and then they end up buying them what (51:01 - 51:06)
did greg get me (51:04 - 51:09)
you'll find nothing both of you will (51:06 - 51:11)
find out hold your horses (51:09 - 51:13)
greg was the one that bought all the (51:11 - 51:15)
skateboards (51:13 - 51:18)
i have my skateboard ebay empire (51:15 - 51:19)
starting so (51:18 - 51:21)
hold out it was a big investment but (51:19 - 51:23)
it's gonna pay off like that ancient (51:21 - 51:24)
meal (51:23 - 51:27)
again i don't i don't mind hat pokemon (51:24 - 51:31)
i'll take hat pokemon over patrat (51:27 - 51:33)
[Applause] (51:31 - 51:35)
what about patrat wearing a hat now (51:33 - 51:37)
we're now in business (51:35 - 51:38)
checking ebay real quick for charizard (51:37 - 51:40)
skateboards well don't give away my (51:38 - 51:41)
username (51:40 - 51:45)
looks like 450 but no bids (51:41 - 51:48)
no look for the uh rayquaza one (51:45 - 51:50)
right charizard wasn't in this drop well (51:48 - 51:52)
that's why i assumed the charizard was (51:50 - 51:54)
the more sought-after one (51:52 - 51:57)
there was last time it was the last drop (51:54 - 51:58)
and they held on to it (51:57 - 52:00)
they they put it next to their ancient (51:58 - 52:03)
mew so it could appreciate in value (52:00 - 52:05)
all of mine are next to my beanie babies (52:03 - 52:07)
my ancient mew (52:05 - 52:10)
and my burger king gold meal i am going (52:07 - 52:11)
to make (52:10 - 52:14)
bank okay the rayquaza one sold (52:11 - 52:19)
these are i looked at sold sold for 3.99 (52:14 - 52:23)
so 150 more than retail the (52:19 - 52:25)
togepi ones with seven bids sold for (52:23 - 52:27)
360. (52:25 - 52:31)
the toxtricity one sold for 425. (52:27 - 52:34)
the mew1 oh they're saying that there (52:31 - 52:36)
was 250 of each made (52:34 - 52:39)
in their ebay listing oh yeah because (52:36 - 52:40)
i'm pretty sure when you ordered it you (52:39 - 52:43)
got a card saying which number you got (52:40 - 52:45)
so that makes sense so you would know (52:43 - 52:49)
that you got like five out of 250 or or (52:45 - 52:52)
so the mu one sold for 525 dollars that (52:49 - 52:53)
was what you should bought (52:52 - 52:57)
not the togepi i don't know which one (52:53 - 53:01)
i'm getting whichever one my mom (52:57 - 53:04)
managed to get (53:01 - 53:04)
see another rayquaza here for 435 sold (53:05 - 53:10)
uh togepi for 350. (53:08 - 53:14)
umbreon for 440. mew for 450 (53:10 - 53:18)
what was really impressive too was uh (53:14 - 53:21)
the you know the order was made on (53:18 - 53:22)
tuesday (53:21 - 53:26)
uh my mom got it on friday wow (53:22 - 53:27)
do you know what's sad is a lot of these (53:26 - 53:30)
ebay pictures have the same flooring (53:27 - 53:32)
and the same set up for the pictures (53:30 - 53:33)
meaning (53:32 - 53:35)
the same same people same person bought (53:33 - 53:37)
them and then immediately put them on (53:35 - 53:38)
ebay (53:37 - 53:42)
quit calling me out it wasn't me (53:38 - 53:44)
i think i think as long as your mom (53:42 - 53:45)

wall hanger i'm gonna hang it on my wall (53:53 - 53:58)
that's true i'm not here to flip it well (53:55 - 54:01)
oh well maybe kick flip it but that's it (53:58 - 54:01)
but that's (54:01 - 54:04)
it just once just that once yeah each (54:01 - 54:05)
one (54:04 - 54:08)
is unique according to mr bear walker (54:05 - 54:10)
how is that possible because they're (54:08 - 54:12)
handmade right aren't they (54:10 - 54:16)
i can't hand make what there were four (54:12 - 54:16)
styles (54:16 - 54:19)
five times that's why it took him so (54:16 - 54:21)
long for drop two he had to go to the (54:19 - 54:23)
woods chop down the tree (54:21 - 54:26)
oh boy oh boy you want to believe that (54:23 - 54:26)

um shout out to the uh score bunny with (54:52 - 54:57)
the nikket outfit which is a reference (54:55 - 54:58)
to the anime (54:57 - 55:02)
that's probably the only one to really (54:58 - 55:04)
mention there question of the week (55:02 - 55:05)
though (55:04 - 55:10)
yes greg it's all you it's the (55:05 - 55:14)
question of the week let's hear that (55:10 - 55:16)
question now (55:14 - 55:20)
it's the question of the week (55:16 - 55:23)
asked from the attic channel (55:20 - 55:27)
in slack (55:23 - 55:28)
i want to answer the question but i (55:27 - 55:30)
don't know (55:28 - 55:32)
what can we can we hear the question and (55:30 - 55:34)
then we'll be able to also decide (55:32 - 55:35)
whether we want to answer (55:34 - 55:36)
i don't think any of us have enough (55:35 - 55:38)
knowledge uh with all the issues going (55:36 - 55:39)
on with 10 cents do you think (55:38 - 55:40)
10 cent do you think it will affect (55:39 - 55:42)
pokemon unite i don't know what issues (55:40 - 55:44)
are happening right now (55:42 - 55:47)
yeah i i have no idea i guess we (55:44 - 55:49)
i'll i'll look into it for next week (55:47 - 55:50)
because i don't know what's happening (55:49 - 55:52)
with 10 cent (55:50 - 55:53)
uh and i don't want to be like yes or no (55:52 - 55:55)
because i don't know how drastic (55:53 - 55:59)
it is uh but it's china so it's probably (55:55 - 56:01)
very bad (55:59 - 56:04)
well let's see money.cnn.com has it as a (56:01 - 56:05)
headline (56:04 - 56:08)
tencent is having a tough year (56:05 - 56:11)
um there's also a headline following (56:08 - 56:13)
tick tock us may now be targeting (56:11 - 56:14)
china's 10 cent on (56:13 - 56:16)
security issues 10 sounds pretty big (56:14 - 56:17)
though (56:16 - 56:19)
yeah like 10 cents like the amazon of (56:17 - 56:21)
china so i don't (56:19 - 56:22)
even if it's a bad year it's gonna take (56:21 - 56:24)
a lot to bring down 10 cents this (56:22 - 56:26)
this seems like a much more involved (56:24 - 56:27)
like (56:26 - 56:30)
question question about 10 cent because (56:27 - 56:32)
i mean if it's (56:30 - 56:34)
it's hard to know because like right now (56:32 - 56:36)
it's rumors that they might be targeting (56:34 - 56:36)
them so (56:36 - 56:39)
like we'll know in a little bit and it's (56:36 - 56:40)
probably better to ask that question (56:39 - 56:41)
once that's (56:40 - 56:44)
yeah settled or given a positive (56:41 - 56:48)
direction but uh will it affect us (56:44 - 56:50)
getting pokemon unite like (56:48 - 56:53)
permanently i doubt it yeah because (56:50 - 56:54)
that's not the developer they're just (56:53 - 56:57)
the publisher yeah exactly (56:54 - 57:00)
on time no it's not it was yeah (56:57 - 57:02)
it was like another company that had a (57:00 - 57:04)
name that was hard to (57:02 - 57:06)
pronounce brandon says what in your (57:04 - 57:08)
opinions is the most over-hyped pokemon (57:06 - 57:11)
opinion or stance for example i think (57:08 - 57:14)
the too much water statement for gen 3 (57:11 - 57:16)
is really overstated and used as a (57:14 - 57:18)
scapegoat argument against gen 3. (57:16 - 57:22)
i agree with that it is way overstated (57:18 - 57:24)
there was way too much water it's 50 50 (57:22 - 57:25)
is the (57:24 - 57:27)
is the entire thing of the game it's (57:25 - 57:29)
half water half land that is the theme (57:27 - 57:30)
of the game (57:29 - 57:32)
and i will have butter and there's half (57:30 - 57:33)
on land in in (57:32 - 57:36)
universe too many caves there are too (57:33 - 57:37)
many caves (57:36 - 57:40)
period caves are not interesting (57:37 - 57:43)
i think over-hyped pokemon opinion i (57:40 - 57:44)
think (57:43 - 57:46)
the most over hyped pokemon opinion is (57:44 - 57:48)
that gen 2 is good (57:46 - 57:52)
i mean gen 2 is good i think all pokemon (57:48 - 57:52)
games (57:52 - 57:55)
are good yes i don't think any main (57:52 - 57:57)
series pokemon game is bad (57:55 - 57:59)
i just don't think gen 2 was like the (57:57 - 58:00)
pinnacle of pokemon (57:59 - 58:04)
yes i think my over hyped opinion is new (58:00 - 58:07)
pokemon games are too easy (58:04 - 58:10)
yeah you i i think that is (58:07 - 58:12)
i agree with that one i think that i (58:10 - 58:14)
cannot stand that statement (58:12 - 58:16)
because gosh i don't want to i want this (58:14 - 58:18)
to be a huge rant (58:16 - 58:20)
don't don't get into the speed rant we (58:18 - 58:21)
all go to youtube (58:20 - 58:23)
the rant is on there yeah i should make (58:21 - 58:25)
the the (58:23 - 58:27)
so the first pokemon the first pokemon (58:25 - 58:28)
game you play is always going to be the (58:27 - 58:30)
hardest and that's not necessarily (58:28 - 58:32)
to even say that that pokemon's gonna (58:30 - 58:33)
game is going to be hard if you (58:32 - 58:35)
understand like role-playing games in (58:33 - 58:37)
general um so for example like the first (58:35 - 58:38)
time you (58:37 - 58:40)
you've i think a lot of people have this (58:38 - 58:42)
that are our age like the first time you (58:40 - 58:42)
fight brock and you (58:42 - 58:44)
scratch with your charmander or (58:42 - 58:46)
something you're like oh that didn't do (58:44 - 58:47)
any damage (58:46 - 58:49)
um or like i used ember on onyx it (58:47 - 58:50)
didn't do any damage (58:49 - 58:53)
oh i used vine whip on it like you learn (58:50 - 58:56)
throughout playing the game (58:53 - 58:58)
that which pokemon are weak against (58:56 - 58:59)
what's it (58:58 - 59:01)
what attacks like you that is something (58:59 - 59:02)
you learn and then once you get there (59:01 - 59:05)
you cannot unlearn it (59:02 - 59:07)
it's true you can't i mean you can but (59:05 - 59:09)
sure yeah i guess anything (59:07 - 59:12)
theoretically but when you get to blaine (59:09 - 59:14)
at that point i always use blaine (59:12 - 59:15)
because he has the worst pokemon ever he (59:14 - 59:16)
is like a ponyta (59:15 - 59:18)
darkening and right when you get to (59:16 - 59:20)
blaine you can't you (59:18 - 59:22)
you know at that point in the game fire (59:20 - 59:24)
type pokemon are weak to water (59:22 - 59:27)
so you know that that is what you should (59:24 - 59:28)
do (59:27 - 59:30)
and you literally had to surf like (59:28 - 59:34)
across two rats of water to get there (59:30 - 59:37)
so when people say like new pokemon (59:34 - 59:38)
games are easy (59:37 - 59:40)
no you just you've already learned at (59:38 - 59:41)
that point that fire is weak to water (59:40 - 59:44)
and it's very hard to not remember that (59:41 - 59:46)
i mean like it's sometimes hard to (59:44 - 59:46)
remember like oh (59:46 - 59:48)
what's fairy week to or what's very (59:46 - 59:50)
strong too but like the very basic (59:48 - 59:52)
horrors of like water fire grass (59:50 - 59:55)
is is what the game revolves around (59:52 - 59:57)
i mean as an adult who came to the games (59:55 - 59:59)
they were always easy (59:57 - 60:02)
pretty much yes yeah i mean the the the (59:59 - 60:03)
level of difficulty (60:02 - 60:06)
has never changed the amount of grinding (60:03 - 60:07)
you have to do has changed (60:06 - 60:10)
right but grinding does not equal (60:07 - 60:11)
difficulty (60:10 - 60:13)
or fun so like when people are like i (60:11 - 60:14)
want pokemon (60:13 - 60:16)
games to be harder i'm not a hundred (60:14 - 60:19)
percent sure what they're asking (60:16 - 60:22)
for i mean i know even if they (60:19 - 60:25)
increase the like even if they balance (60:22 - 60:26)
you off let's say (60:25 - 60:28)
like you know you're level 30 you walk (60:26 - 60:29)
into a gym they bring you down to level (60:28 - 60:30)
20. that gym (60:29 - 60:33)
level 20. you still know that if i use a (60:30 - 60:34)
water type move here (60:33 - 60:36)
i'm that is the best move and i will (60:34 - 60:38)
knock them out like you still know that (60:36 - 60:42)
yeah and i even it like it (60:38 - 60:43)
altered across alternate chromosome i (60:42 - 60:45)
think is a really good example of that (60:43 - 60:47)
fight you know alternate chroma (60:45 - 60:49)
when you get to it it is for most (60:47 - 60:50)
players not all (60:49 - 60:54)
significantly overleveled and it it's (60:50 - 60:55)
significantly faster than pretty much (60:54 - 60:57)
every pokemon (60:55 - 61:00)
and it one shots almost any pokemon (60:57 - 61:03)
unless you know unless you have the (61:00 - 61:04)
information about it right so if you (61:03 - 61:06)
looked up what alternate crosma's typing (61:04 - 61:07)
was (61:06 - 61:09)
you would know what it resists and what (61:07 - 61:10)
is super effective against it (61:09 - 61:12)
but if you went into which i mean kind (61:10 - 61:15)
of which you can do for any pokemon but (61:12 - 61:16)
if you don't know like uh i don't even (61:15 - 61:17)
remember what (61:16 - 61:18)
alternate across them is it's like (61:17 - 61:21)
dragon oh gosh it's like dragon (61:18 - 61:21)
something (61:21 - 61:22)
i can't even remember what it's like (61:21 - 61:24)
dragon psychic i think that seems (61:22 - 61:25)
appropriate (61:24 - 61:27)
so off the top of my head i don't even (61:25 - 61:28)
know what would be like four times (61:27 - 61:29)
effective (61:28 - 61:32)
dragon is weak to dragon psychic doesn't (61:29 - 61:32)
resist dragon (61:32 - 61:35)
anyways speak to ice dragons weak to ice (61:32 - 61:37)
dragon's weak to ferry (61:35 - 61:38)
i don't think psychic doesn't resist (61:37 - 61:41)
fairy so even even if alternate crosma (61:38 - 61:42)
was level 100 (61:41 - 61:45)
and it had perfect ivs and evs you can (61:42 - 61:47)
still beat it with a level 26 masculine (61:45 - 61:50)
i did it because i just understand how (61:47 - 61:51)
pokemon works (61:50 - 61:54)
i just focus the masculine endured (61:51 - 61:58)
retaliated aquajet okay cool it didn't (61:54 - 61:59)
matter what moves it knew (61:58 - 62:01)
it didn't matter what stats it were i (61:59 - 62:02)
just think the like (62:01 - 62:06)
newer pokemon games are too easy kind of (62:02 - 62:08)
misses the whole (62:06 - 62:11)
fact that they were (62:08 - 62:13)
they were always too easy right it (62:11 - 62:14)
misses the fact they were always easy (62:13 - 62:15)
and the fact that like (62:14 - 62:17)
most times you lose even even in like (62:15 - 62:19)
competitive pokemon (62:17 - 62:21)
which i've done a lot of this weekend (62:19 - 62:22)
most of the times i lost (62:21 - 62:24)
wasn't because i didn't understand (62:22 - 62:26)
pokemon it was because i was surprised (62:24 - 62:27)
with something (62:26 - 62:29)
and i think the most in our slack (62:27 - 62:31)
community a lot of people said they lost (62:29 - 62:32)
a raejan for the first time (62:31 - 62:34)
because they were like oh a dragon type (62:32 - 62:36)
person i'm going to bring these pokemon (62:34 - 62:38)
and reihan doesn't use a lot of dragons (62:36 - 62:42)
um and if you don't know what duraladon (62:38 - 62:45)
does duraladon is very powerful if you (62:42 - 62:46)
if you don't do that so (62:45 - 62:49)
i think maybe i guess what people are (62:46 - 62:51)
actually asking for is i want the game (62:49 - 62:52)
to surprise me more with like (62:51 - 62:54)
just these one-off gimmicks but once you (62:52 - 62:55)
learn the gimmick that's the thing (62:54 - 62:56)
though is like (62:55 - 62:59)
once i learned joel once i knew jolteon (62:56 - 63:01)
had shadowball i go (62:59 - 63:03)
oh well that jolteon probably has shadow (63:01 - 63:05)
ball so uh the second time i fight it i (63:03 - 63:07)
kind of know what to expect now (63:05 - 63:08)
also jolteon learn shadow ball just a (63:07 - 63:10)
fun fact (63:08 - 63:12)
i mean i think people want i think what (63:10 - 63:13)
people want is (63:12 - 63:17)
more surprises but i think where a lot (63:13 - 63:18)
of the arguments break down (63:17 - 63:20)
is and i've said this multiple times and (63:18 - 63:22)
i'll say this on the show (63:20 - 63:24)
they want to relive the experience they (63:22 - 63:26)
had as a child and you can never do that (63:24 - 63:27)
as an adult (63:26 - 63:30)
yeah you can never go back you have too (63:27 - 63:32)
much experience to be completely (63:30 - 63:33)
surprised by something (63:32 - 63:36)
like you were as a kid nothing is new (63:33 - 63:39)
anymore once you become an adult (63:36 - 63:41)
and it's very hard to go back and say (63:39 - 63:44)
well when i was 10 (63:41 - 63:45)
that game seemed so hard well yeah (63:44 - 63:48)
because you were 10 (63:45 - 63:50)
like your brain hadn't fully formed yet (63:48 - 63:51)
you can't (63:50 - 63:54)
you can't keep judging games based off (63:51 - 63:55)
of how they were (63:54 - 63:58)
when you were a child because you didn't (63:55 - 63:58)
have (63:58 - 64:00)
an accurate view of what that game (63:58 - 64:02)
actually was like (64:00 - 64:04)
and you can't go back and play it again (64:02 - 64:06)
now because you are prepared for that (64:04 - 64:07)
game (64:06 - 64:08)
and it will be a completely different (64:07 - 64:10)
experience and you will allow (64:08 - 64:13)
most people allow nostalgia to override (64:10 - 64:15)
a lot of what the flaws are (64:13 - 64:17)
but trust me as a person who approached (64:15 - 64:19)
it at age 28 (64:17 - 64:21)
those games were easy and they always (64:19 - 64:22)
have been easy (64:21 - 64:24)
difficulty is not why i'm playing (64:22 - 64:25)
pokemon (64:24 - 64:28)
why are you playing pokemon for like a (64:25 - 64:30)
million other reasons collecting (64:28 - 64:32)
breeding i also do my friends really (64:30 - 64:34)
understand people (64:32 - 64:35)
so when people are like i want pokemon (64:34 - 64:37)
to be hard i mean i guess maybe you (64:35 - 64:38)
could have harder (64:37 - 64:42)
puzzles in the gyms (64:38 - 64:44)
i mean i think when they say if anybody (64:42 - 64:45)
asks i want (64:44 - 64:48)
want it to be hard they need to define (64:45 - 64:48)
what hard (64:48 - 64:53)
means for them because more hard is just (64:48 - 64:55)
who knows what you mean who knows what (64:53 - 64:56)
you find too easy who knows what you (64:55 - 64:58)
want to actually be more hard (64:56 - 65:00)
is it catching do you want catching to (64:58 - 65:01)
be more frustrating (65:00 - 65:04)
do you want a nuzlocke type thing where (65:01 - 65:06)
you can't use them after they knocked (65:04 - 65:07)
out like (65:06 - 65:10)
you need to define what hard is right (65:07 - 65:12)
because i just i just don't get where (65:10 - 65:13)
like if somebody's like (65:12 - 65:15)
disappointed in how challenging the gym (65:13 - 65:16)
leaders are the elite for (65:15 - 65:19)
the rival it's like those those those (65:16 - 65:21)
people that complain also just don't (65:19 - 65:22)
seem to be the same people that are (65:21 - 65:24)
interested in competitive after the fact (65:22 - 65:27)
and like the latter and the battle tower (65:24 - 65:29)
like i've done battle tower (65:27 - 65:30)
tons of times in sword shield and (65:29 - 65:32)
sometimes i just lose (65:30 - 65:33)
not because i don't understand but (65:32 - 65:35)
because sometimes the computer is just (65:33 - 65:35)
like (65:35 - 65:38)
oh they just quit claude fisher okay (65:35 - 65:40)
well i guess i'm dead (65:38 - 65:43)
okay um but (65:40 - 65:44)
that's i get that a lot in the twitch (65:43 - 65:46)
stream where people come in (65:44 - 65:48)
and they'll be like i wish pokemon games (65:46 - 65:49)
were harder and i was like (65:48 - 65:50)
do you do competitive and they're like (65:49 - 65:51)
no i don't want to play against real (65:50 - 65:53)
people i was like oh (65:51 - 65:56)
oh oh oh yeah see that's just the thing (65:53 - 65:56)
what do you want (65:56 - 66:01)
i don't know it is harder i mean i i (65:56 - 66:04)
it is so hard to determine difficulty in (66:01 - 66:04)
an (66:04 - 66:07)
rpg because the main thing of an rpg is (66:04 - 66:08)
to tell you the story (66:07 - 66:11)
yep and difficulty is secondary to that (66:08 - 66:12)
now (66:11 - 66:15)
if you want an action game then there (66:12 - 66:16)
are ways to make (66:15 - 66:17)
action games difficult but that's (66:16 - 66:19)
usually timing (66:17 - 66:22)
and dexterity stuff which makes it a (66:19 - 66:24)
very different game (66:22 - 66:26)
like even people say oh if it was real (66:24 - 66:28)
time will you have a real time game (66:26 - 66:30)
in pokemon masters and you don't like it (66:28 - 66:32)
well that's real time greg (66:30 - 66:35)
it's mostly real time yeah so (66:32 - 66:39)
like what is hard because this has never (66:35 - 66:40)
been that game (66:39 - 66:43)
they have never been difficult games not (66:40 - 66:44)
once (66:43 - 66:46)
i would say getting a hundred wins in a (66:44 - 66:49)
row in battle tower uh in sun and moon (66:46 - 66:51)
ultrasound ultramoon was for me very (66:49 - 66:52)
hard (66:51 - 66:54)
well yeah there there are competitive (66:52 - 66:56)
can be very difficult (66:54 - 66:59)
and they've built in like if i remember (66:56 - 67:01)
correctly the trees also (66:59 - 67:04)
learned how you were playing the game (67:01 - 67:05)
what your team could do (67:04 - 67:07)
and ratcheted up the the people who came (67:05 - 67:10)
out based off of that information (67:07 - 67:12)
um so that was built into the game and (67:10 - 67:13)
if you're saying (67:12 - 67:16)
all the gyms should do that then (67:13 - 67:19)
gyms can't be type based because battle (67:16 - 67:20)
tree isn't type based (67:19 - 67:23)
i also don't love the argument of like (67:20 - 67:24)
well if they get rid of type based gyms (67:23 - 67:26)
it becomes harder because like (67:24 - 67:29)
that's what your rival check is for yeah (67:26 - 67:30)
i mean you have a rival (67:29 - 67:34)
who does that you had and who did it (67:30 - 67:37)
yeah well pokemon of the week oh boy oh (67:34 - 67:38)
boy (67:37 - 67:42)
uh let's see what did we have for last (67:38 - 67:44)
week's pokemon of them i don't know (67:42 - 67:46)
you didn't you didn't get the answer you (67:44 - 67:47)
didn't figure it out (67:46 - 67:50)
give me the clues again uh so the (67:47 - 67:52)
previous week's pokemon could be (67:50 - 67:54)
identified by just one letter (67:52 - 67:57)
uh this week's psychic type pokemon (67:54 - 68:00)
is represented by every letter and some (67:57 - 68:01)
punctuation (68:00 - 68:04)
and gallerian if you look at the (68:01 - 68:06)
gallerian alphabet it does not (68:04 - 68:09)
look like this pokemon because this (68:06 - 68:10)
pokemon does not exist (68:09 - 68:13)
in galler and i would say (68:10 - 68:16)
the other clue was that it's not that (68:13 - 68:18)
exciting of a pokemon in the (68:16 - 68:21)
traditional games but in pokemon go boy (68:18 - 68:22)
oh boy people (68:21 - 68:26)
people are looking to get these guys (68:22 - 68:31)
so there you go there's your clues it's (68:26 - 68:32)
[Music] (68:31 - 68:36)
the best is fifa isn't even in pokemon (68:32 - 68:37)
go (68:36 - 68:39)
yeah it is i said people are looking to (68:37 - 68:40)
get these guys (68:39 - 68:42)
and no one wants to be best and [ __ ] (68:40 - 68:43)
[ __ ] up (68:42 - 68:45)
i've seen a lot of people on my friend (68:43 - 68:47)
list that had the shiny fee bass and (68:45 - 68:49)
they're walking with their shiny females (68:47 - 68:53)
though you gotta walk it it's (68:49 - 68:56)
unknown yes yes it is the the alphabet (68:53 - 68:58)
pokemon or whatever it's i don't know (68:56 - 69:00)
what its name is what its (68:58 - 69:03)
typing is the symbol pokemon the symbol (69:00 - 69:04)
okay (69:03 - 69:07)
there you go that's what letters are our (69:04 - 69:08)
symbols (69:07 - 69:11)
i'm sort of bummed that (69:08 - 69:14)
in like so in spell of the unknown there (69:11 - 69:16)
are a bunch that were like greek (69:14 - 69:16)
alphabet (69:16 - 69:18)
letter unknowns and those have never (69:16 - 69:19)
appeared in the games (69:18 - 69:21)
yeah and they never will yeah wait for (69:19 - 69:23)
the uh (69:21 - 69:26)
gen 9 and greece in greece (69:23 - 69:29)
ooh there we go you want to know what's (69:26 - 69:31)
more useless than a hat pokemon in (69:29 - 69:33)
pokemon go (69:31 - 69:37)
unknown i mean eventually i'll have all (69:33 - 69:39)
the ones to spell my name (69:37 - 69:42)
how many letters do they have out 20 (69:39 - 69:44)
well 26 letters and then the exclamation (69:42 - 69:45)
in the (69:44 - 69:49)
are they all out in pokemon go yeah okay (69:45 - 69:50)
because when they first came out it was (69:49 - 69:53)
just like p-a-x yeah (69:50 - 69:55)
they do they'll do every unknown can (69:53 - 69:57)
spawn (69:55 - 69:59)
in the wild but only one unknown spawns (69:57 - 70:02)
every 20 minutes in the game (69:59 - 70:04)
so it's only one location at a time in (70:02 - 70:05)
the world (70:04 - 70:08)
in the world in the world somebody like (70:05 - 70:09)
data mined it (70:08 - 70:13)
it can be any of the 26 letters (70:09 - 70:16)
yes anywhere anywhere in the world (70:13 - 70:18)
anywhere in the world but once every 20 (70:16 - 70:19)
minutes (70:18 - 70:22)
that is some rare pokemon right (70:19 - 70:23)
i can't i can't figure out how they (70:22 - 70:26)
calculated it and it's not obviously an (70:23 - 70:27)
official source but it's because (70:26 - 70:29)
they were they were able to figure out i (70:27 - 70:31)
mean it's like a spoofer thing right (70:29 - 70:33)
because you can spoof to any pokestop (70:31 - 70:37)
um and like look but based on like the (70:33 - 70:37)
ratio (70:37 - 70:40)
and unknown being one of the rare spawns (70:37 - 70:41)
and based on how many pokestops there (70:40 - 70:43)
are in the world it was (70:41 - 70:45)
uh it can only spawn at one pokestop at (70:43 - 70:47)
a time if there's not an event (70:45 - 70:50)
intriguing could be different though i (70:47 - 70:51)
[Music] (70:50 - 70:54)
since they turned it shiny or they made (70:51 - 70:55)
some of them shiny this year (70:54 - 71:00)
and the shiny is kind of dull blue (70:55 - 71:03)
yeah i do like the um (71:00 - 71:06)
well the question mark shuffle icon i (71:03 - 71:07)
think is yeah favorite (71:06 - 71:11)
it's a good one it's cute i know (71:07 - 71:12)
it's also looking at you like real (71:11 - 71:15)
sarcastically yeah exactly (71:12 - 71:17)
unknown is currently represented in the (71:15 - 71:19)
trading card game by the most cards (71:17 - 71:22)
of any pokemon after pikachu with the (71:19 - 71:25)
with a unique 90 different cards (71:22 - 71:28)
that's even better than chair is aired (71:25 - 71:29)
unknown was the only generation 2 (71:28 - 71:31)
pokemon not to be featured in the (71:29 - 71:32)
pokemon (71:31 - 71:35)
ranger series yeah disappointing (71:32 - 71:38)
despite unknown being able to use tm 10 (71:35 - 71:39)
in generation (71:38 - 71:41)
six and seven it still cannot do so (71:39 - 71:43)
legitimately because it will already (71:41 - 71:45)
know hidden power (71:43 - 71:48)
two main official uh artwork for unknown (71:45 - 71:52)
represents a g for gold and silver and (71:48 - 71:52)
an (71:52 - 71:54)
f for ruby and sapphire which may allude (71:52 - 71:56)
to the acronym (71:54 - 71:59)
game for game freak (71:56 - 72:03)
