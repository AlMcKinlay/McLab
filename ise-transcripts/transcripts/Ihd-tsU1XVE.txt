Oh what's up everyone welcome to the 212 episode of the Pokemon podcast my name is spj and with me on this thursday morning at 1201 a.m. is micah the brave midnight the brave midnight the brave how are you Micah good I'm I'm kind of tired me too we're recording really late but I wanted to get something out this week before we go back to the sunday the normal sunday recordings especially since midwest gaming classic was this past weekend and i wasn't i was unable to record so here we are but before before we dive in to midwest gaming classic and everything this is just really an episode kind of recapping midwest game of classic and micah micah is here because Michael was at Midwest game classic with myself so we're just gonna be recapping that and probably i'll just probably touch on the movie night that i had a out the other night with with some of the patreon backers and twitter and facebook followers so we'll touch on that but how was your week Micah how's your weekend how's your week my weekend was loaded with classic games the end pokemon the classiest classiest of classic games it was good and then the week's been you know this busy busy and exhausting you've been streaming I have been I actually didn't stream tonight because as you know I got hung up and but I streams last night and we played quantum break which is a very unique and very interesting game are you liking it I am that's it is really interesting by the people who did uh Alan Wake yeah correct you yep Remedy Entertainment they did they do something really unique with this game where it's very choice based so at the end of each chapter you have about probably 2-3 hours of gameplay and then at the end of the chapter you make a crucial for the story and you have two options you pick one and then they give you about a 22 minute long live action episode that changes depending on what choices you've made throughout the game and I'm sure you've seen a lot of the characters are there acted like voice acted and face models for the kid from actual actors a little finger from Game of Thrones is one of them and I think everybody was saying Iceman from x-men but I don't really know who that guy is so mr. translates really well yes mr. freeze from batman forever or is that Batman Robin our lair I think batman forever I just like us to meet you will brendel the biggest Batman fan in the world is probably yelling at his iphone right now that we don't know that man breeze to meet you know it's really good though they it's it's a really unique take on on it's an interesting format that I haven't really seen before um and some people really liked it some people were kind of like I don't really want to watch 22 minute long cutscene just let me play the game but it was kind of neat I turned off the webcam and I turned off the mic and we just SAT and watched it and talked about it in chat it was a good time cool cool so far so good it's a very beautiful game I have not been playing quantum break but I have been been playing a lot of clash Royale the old clash regal and boys that game frustrating there's like something we I've talked about clash Royale before on on the show but diving deeper into it and now spending spending money money what with it there's like this commitment now that I have of trying to get good as as the kids would say yes the kids would say and say and it good and it's funny because you know I was never a clash of clans player like I understand the the appeal I understand the the shady business of it I understand the money sink that it is and I understand that a lot of people play it without spending any money I totally get that I was back in the day big simpsons tapped out fan I think throughout that that mobile game lifetime I probably put two hundred dollars or so into it and it was very like it was very like I'm limiting myself to ten dollars a week and then it came to like well now they had the scratch-off ticket so I'm going to do one scratch off ticket a day that's only one dollar a day that's only seven dollars a week and if something's on sale you know it's on sale so i can splurge a little this week i'll put twenty dollars this is how i got to two hundred dollars you know fast forward to clash Royale which is more of a I'll just explain it right sits like at our offense game our defense but more of taking out their towers in order to win while defending your towers and you build a deck of you build a deck of eight different cards and as you go you get a lot of free cards in a day you if there's timers for three our chests and when you open the chest i think you get like 20 or 30 cards and you can put those cards and infuse them and they become stronger and then your deck overall becomes stronger and it's player versus player you're always playing a human and i think that that probably adds a lot to my anger that comes with the game of like I know that it's a human and when I make a mistake like i feel that like i am better than this and i'm better than this person on the other side of the screen and like when they make a mistake that feels like really good because you know computers usually don't make mistakes and you know humans do and so I've sunk some money into it which i think is fine and there's a lot of people that are like I'll never put money into it but I think you come from a magic background of me coming from a Pokemon background there's a lot of like we spent a lot of money oh god the time to get like four cards in our deck that would embarrassing amount of money that will be obsolete in three months or six months or yep like like I bought two tropical beaches and there were a hundred dollars each for a deck that Iran at a tournament and then afterwards those cards dropped to eighty dollars and was like wow i could sell noun take a forty dollar loss on these two cards and eventually they went up to 120 and then they went back down they went back up mm-hmm well we talked a little bit about this i don't remember who it was wit i think it was with our friend alex and we were talking about the value the resale value and the one thing that I I said that I kind of have a problem justifying mobile game stuff like this is that there's not much of their even with physical card games there's always somewhat of a resale value at least with magic especially because they have things like legacy formats where cards that are no longer legal in the the most current you know current card set formats people still run those cards in other formats so they still have value to some degree and so even if I get tired of whatever in play if I get tired of magic or whatever it is I can offload everything that I have for at least something you know where with a mobile game I feel like there's no opportunity really to do that the money's gone you know but that being said I did you with your incredible ability to get convinced people to play the mobile games that you're playing I did over the course of the mgc weekend i downloaded clash royale I didn't touch it really I played a little bit of this tutorial and then Monday what we were watching Monday Night Raw I picked it up again and played it and I've actually been playing it pretty consistently I haven't put any money into it yet but I'm actually really enjoying it it's it's interesting to me how much hey how much it's like hearthstone yes and also how different it is from hearthstone I agree I agree a hundred percent with both your points and I think that's why I almost like it more than hearthstone yeah there are a lot of mechanics that really take the that hearth stone inspiration and then make it its own and making a new experience and kind of refresh it which is really nice but the thing that was the most distinct to me was how uninvested I was going through the tutorial and still pretty generally skeptical while I was playing me tutorial and then the second that I was playing real people it hit me and it picked up really fast it got really uh like nerve-racking really quickly and I started to get really salty yo and also really uh really heated about how well I wanted to do yeah there was so I've been playing probably probably for three weeks and I would and I've had the game for a month in the first the first week it was kind of the same experiences you i downloaded I played a little bit and then I was like I don't see the appeal I don't see why it's number one in the app store I mean it's not bad i just didn't see what made it so special and then eventually I came back to it just because I was like there was down time I need to do something let's fry clash royal again and I was like oh this chest is done oh look at all these new cards and modifying my deck and now like I'm winning and I went through like uh you know less than a week I got to a thousand trophies which is it whatever it is what it is and then for two weeks I struggled that a thousand and twelve hundred and now in this last week I've pushed up to 1,800 trophies which to me was like a huge couch accomplishment I felt really good I almost made it to 2000 today I was just a couple points couple trophies shy of that and then like today during dinner I dropped down to 1700 and like I was so frustrated I was so disappointed in myself that I went I had like a three hundred trophy span and I was games usually don't make me that mad like I lose all time to poke in on stream and it's it's fine like I shake my head I laughs I play the next game i'm still having fun and i'm not saying i'm not having fun with clash Royale but like it has such a competitive I I know I'm right like I know what I did wrong and I'm not I'm just mad at myself for messing up like when I like launch arrows to take out a minion horde and I timed it one second to short and my arrows with I like know at that moment in time I just lost the match because of one miss play I just did yeah and you kind of get that in pokemon and magic like oh I miss played i'm probably going to lose but at the same time with pokemon and magic you're like well i just drew bad like i just didn't start off good and you don't really get that feeling in clash Royale and I you and I think that's why I like it more than her stone cuz with her stone it's like oh I drew bad and in clash Royale like you have used draw four cards and there's a cards in the deck so like yeah you can go I drew bad but like you're gonna see all the cards in like the next twenty second right yeah and I actually really like that I like that it then it cycles through everything so you see the majority of your deck within the time span of the match you know yeah yeah I like I really like the style I guess III I don't know it's it's hard to say it's it's weird too because I'm generally not anybody that would be interested in a tower defense but it's just enough of that card game influence to make me want to play it to to get me interested in it which is which is surprising for me that I got is into something that's probably kind of primarily tower to tower defense one that's not something I would ever play really and that was the big turnoff for me initially when I was watching you play it and you were telling me about it and stuff I was like I've got tower defense it's not something that I can really get into but you do you get that hog rider yet no hog rider yet not yet have you faced some hog riders and I don't think so I mean I'm pretty early yeah but it's it's you know I'm at a point now where I'm playing real people and getting really upset one it's so close that I just barely take out their second tower before time runs out yeah well going back to what I was saying before before I ranted like i sat at you know a thousand to 1200 for almost two weeks and now I don't really fall below 1,700 like today was the first day in a week I really fell below 1700 and usually I've been sitting at 1809 I got back to 1800 before the podcast but I was I had to like calm myself down and go like like look at what you have accomplished in the matter of like five to seven days like you made this huge jump you broke through this wall you almost made it two thousand today and now you're bumped back down but like you're not really bumped back down like I still made that progress so like that that at the debt that at the end of the day is kind of exciting because it's like I do have progress i could show like hopefully i can break that two thousand while and then get into tournaments and stuff because like i really like the game and that's why i don't mind buying new cards because it's it's exciting like it's cool it's it's it's a great game and for we have a we have we have a pkmn cast iron in it and it's floor right now you can have 50 members in a clan so if you're listening and you're in the clan and you don't play clash royale probably gonna have to kick you out because when you're exclusive its it plus we have what we have up like mike is that even the clan yet we have other people that that are not in the clan and so like gotta knock out the act in active people so we can trade them hog riders it's called clash Royale okay it's very exclusive the most regal Club the most royale of clashes speaking of Royals this past weekend was the Midwest gaming classic it was definitely a kind of a battle royale so it took place in brookfield Wisconsin like it does every year i think i want to say it's like its eighth or ninth year I don't think it's I don't think it had ten because if it had ten I probably they probably would have done something but I I know that it existed a little bit prior to me starting but this was my sixth year there mmhmm yeah and it was kind of it was it was very different compared to a lot of a lot of past years the the biggest change of hosting a Pokemon podcast room as the signs set outside the door was we were in a different room we were in the community hall in the quote-unquote basement which the base it's not really big I mean it's it is a basement but it's it's we're all like this smaller conference rooms are mm-hmm and I wouldn't say there's two three four or five about six rooms down there and mine's not the smallest but not the biggest and there's like two rooms that are kind of merged together that's across the hall anyways we would a showcase hallway I guess the best way to describe it like it's mostly rooms that people are showcasing their games or other people's games you know like like the virtual reality stuff is always in a showcase room and it's kind of hallway that you walk down and on either side all the way down the hallway it's just different showcases for different games or independent games or you know stuff like that right and so we were down there for the last five years and it was great the room was big the only it's a problem it wasn't that big of a problem was there was this huge like conference table in a room that couldn't really leave the room because it was really awkward it was really big it was screwed together like it would probably take four or five people to move it out the door and then once it got out the door there was really no where to put it mm-hmm it was so big but we took advantage of it we'd put all the TVs on it we'd move it in different spots like we would always try to do something with it and you know there was there's never a problem and I think when we first started having problems with the room was when we started sharing with and then the Nintendo reps because two years ago they approached me and they were like hey we want to come to midwest gaming classic there is no space here every single room is taken we really like what you guys do like obviously you're doing pokemon stuff would it be cool if we set up like two tables in the corner of your room next year and like have a wii u and have some ds's and do some giveaways and I was like yeah absolutely like desert from Nintendo like you're not suing me of course like share the room and that was it was awesome the two guys that run it fantastic very very awesome awesome dudes the problem was because they were in attended a brought in so much traffic that it really made the room not comfortable to be in like some people want to come in they want to sit down they want to play a couple rounds of Pokemon same two they want to play you know 10 15 minutes of pokemon snap they want to do the pokemon pinball they want to do PokePark we have so many different pokemon games going on and we when you have people just coming and coming out for the freebies Nintendo's doing you're blocking the doorway and you're filling the room and so I think we both realize that both parties mm-hmm and we did it again last year what was both of us and it was just almost even worse last year so we both kind of went to the invite people this year and we're like hey this was a scenario last year it was almost like you just give us both separate rooms they could just be a little bit smaller but like we obviously can fill them we've shown you the last five years that you know our rooms are extremely busy and so they're like yeah sure cool here is a new room they actually moved the Nintendo guys across the hall into that big room I described earlier and they got more space I mean they were still sharing with people but they definitely got more space and the Pokemon podcast room got moved upstairs which was exciting something different but the room was significantly smaller and I think I did the best I good working with the space yeah you did for what it was if you if you didn't make it there Steve did a really good job with making it spacious for what it way I mean imagine all of the rooms on that level and in that block are all hotel rooms that they essentially they take the bed out of they empty it out and they they leave you pretty much nothing I guess for you to fill with your tables and your products and stuff like that and you for how small it was you did a really good job of making it spacious yeah and this year we actually had we had poking tournament setup we had pokemon stadium 2 pokemon snap the pokemon pinball machine that uh myself an errand built and then our merch table lismore so what we fit in the other rooms minus pokin I mean substitute like Pokemon Stadium one or bar pokemon puzzle league or you know some other games and you made the call of no chairs which i think was a good call because that would have made the room even more smaller but I think it also benefited in like hey like play some pokemon stadium 2 but like don't sit here for eight hours right especially like people have a tendency to if they see that their chairs they think well I'll just sit here and take a rest and it's it's less about I mean not saying that people would just come in and just just because you have chairs but they're more inclined to stick around I think if you do because it's some place that they can rest from walking around all day yeah and we've we've had past years downstairs where people have spent more than four to five hours in the room yeah at a time and it blows my mind whoa first let me back up it's flattering that they find my room to fit their needs I get it it's awesome cool at the same time you just paid you know forty to sixty dollars for the weekend there's more than enough to see here why are you dedicating so much time to you know cuz you had chairs men I had chairs but you know I'm not on Stadium 2 is not that rare of a game it blew my mind that even though even after we had that conversation about chairs and wound up not putting chairs in the room there were people who would still come in and just sit on the floor yeah like it did I at the end of the day I guess maybe it didn't matter if there were chairs sir we'll sit wherever they want so how'd you will come back to the Pokemon podcast room but how did you feel overall about the con you probably walked around more than i did just because i had to say stationed at the booth boat how'd you feel it how'd you feel the con was i liked it it's good it's it i mean i've been going to for a long time and you know i always enjoy it because it's it's the same experience and you kind of know what to expect you know to expect there's going to be some really cool old stuff there that you've either never seen in person or you you know have never hey you're you haven't played in a long time or something like that something from your childhood that you haven't seen in forever and the vendor hall i think last year the year before was the first time that they started doing a tent outside for the vendor hall instead of inside i think this is the third year they're in it yeah cuz the first this is the first year where the tent was like the biggest that's ever been yeah but i remember the last they're both years they had the tent prior was rainy and flooded yep and the tents nice it you know it it is a good place for people to walk around and see the vendors and stuff like that but all in all it's generally always the same experience with some new little surprises that you find along the way so it's nice being able to you know when you're anticipating mgc and you're getting ready for it and you're looking forward to it you know exactly what it's going to be and it's comforting going to it and it's exactly what you were anticipating that being said I a couple times this weekend and even to people who other friends of mine who were there that have been going for a long time as well that midwest gaming classic i think is drastically outgrown that facility that that location it's the fact that they have to keep increasing the size of the tent that they have outsize outside is a clear indicator that it's too big for the Brookfield hotel yeah I think it's just it needs to be somewhere where people can have access to everything pretty pretty quickly because everything's really really spread out in a really awkward way with how big it's grown there's you know a lot of the stuff that you see is really cool as always you know I i saw i don't know if you saw this but when i was walking around the head in a glass case the nintendo playstation but like one remaining a copy of it the actual console they had it in like a glass case and that was really cool to see because i've never seen that before um and i picked up a couple things couple like you know it was very cool it's obviously you can't play it but you know was one of those gems you were hinting at earlier the guy selling v pokemon roms uh i mean that's something that I hadn't seen yet I don't think I've seen some you know rom hacks before but I think the last few years up until this year I hadn't really been paying attention to like grey area as far as legality goes on like games that are available in the vendor hall but this one caught my eye mostly just because they had the twitch plays pokemon anniversary cartridge which was pretty cool like the physical cartridge and I wound up picking that up but they had a lot of them they had a ton of them which were a lot of fam games that has fan-made games that I've seen before but all on you know really generic Gameboy cartridges or Game Boy Advance cartridges there's absolutely no way that there is any legal merit to any of that that can't be legal right right then if I know that the switch plays pokemon cartridge was available for a while now-like it was you know they did it for the first anniversary the one year anniversary and it was sold online and I'm sure that Nintendo saw that and didn't do anything about it so I mean that one in specific I guess maybe I don't know why that would be much of a difference though you know there was probably 20 to 30 easily different types of ROM whether it was like Pokemon sky dark version or Pokemon brown or pokemon sweet dreams or Pokemon Rayquaza emerald version pokémon glazed and and like he said like some of those you saw before and I like I cannot imagine that this guy went and grabbed these roms like whoever made Pokemon Brown and was like I grabbed this rom I put it into a game board cartridge I print out a sticker I stick the sticker on I make up a box to put it in and I sell it for forty dollars because I think every single romhack was forty dollars would put money on it that the person who made those roms they are not seeing a penny right absolutely it can't be it can't be like the only reason that I think the twitch plays pokemon version was a different scenarios because they Vere they had very specific packaging for the one that was sold in conjunction with the actual twitch plays pokemon anniversary like a sleeve that had embossed printing and you know it's something that none of the other ones had really yeah and even then it was marked up for sure from what it was sold online for so my my guess at least from being there with that the guy bought some on Etsy or wherever it was that they sold them and then just sold them it along with his other roms and marked it up ten dollars or whatever it is that he marked it up as far as the legality goes it's it's amazing to me that nintendo hasnt seen hasn't done anything i mean maybe this this guy is an anomaly but I I have to think that if he's doing it multiple people at multiple different retro game conventions all over the states are probably also doing it and the fact that Nintendo is a company that will go on to you or whatever and strike people copyright strike people for reviewing their games or whatever it is and there's nothing that's been done about this and this guy could just be there out in the open selling stuff that was clearly infringing on on an IP right what's kind of mind-blowing yeah and no and I'm not saying like whoever made Pokemon Brown obviously this guy grabbed it put it on the cartridge now signing for four dollars person who made Pokemon Brown isn't seeing a penny that may be but I highly doubt it because there were so many different rom versions all right this goes back to there was you know 30 different rom versions like the guy selling it I guarantee you the guy selling it didn't make these round versions like he grabbed them from somewhere dumped them started selling them and totally absolutely to the legality issue there's there's no way that like like that would be like me taking banjo kazooie and like switching out Kazooie to be of pijat and then switching out banjo to be a bear taking when like forty dollars here's your Pokemon Kazooie game come and get it hot off the presses you just can't do that it's almost like I guess I what I would almost equate it to is if someone made cut an album of cover songs or something and they released it for free because they didn't want to infringe on the original artists work they released it for free online and weren't making any money from it and then somebody who downloaded it then burned it to a bunch of CDs and took it somewhere and started selling it like that that's kind of the you can have rom hacks and and distribute them online for free because you know it's it's it's fan it's essentially fan art where to some degree it's it's I feel like it falls under the same the same category it's you know it's it's a piece of fan work and you're not making any money from it from it it's it's not anything that you're taking money from Nintendo for so for this guy to then take that and copy it all having done pretty much no work and then sell it is pretty shady yes yes and it it almost blows my mind even more that that when yours I I don't know I don't know the extent of how to sign up for a vendor booths because the people the vendors do a different process than the people doing rooms and so when when you sign up to be a vendor is what do you say you're selling I'm just selling hash pokemon games here for 40 hours apiece I know it's not legal but you know I'll be right over the year that cool awesome cool well and they were selling a bunch of other stuff so I think they probably didn't they probably weren't completely clear and what they were everything they were going to be selling like they had a section of plushies and you know all kinds of stuff that towards the end of the day one of the things that I noticed is towards the end of the day and towards the beginning of the day almost all of the rom hack stuff was either covered up or it wasn't out yet and when we were going around the vendor halls and everything was packed up way before everybody else is packed up that guy had all of the rom hacks packed up and that kind of made me feel like he knew he wasn't supposed to probably wasn't supposed to be selling the stuff there but again I'm sure some of the people mgc that run mgc probably didn't really know or care either you know right cuz I I've been to c2e2 and like I've walked up and down the aisles and you see DHS's that are clearly knockoff VHS is yeah all in a row and it's it's it's the same thing and it's like how like how are you selling knockoff VHS is it such a big event but like who who is who's going to say something I guess with with midwest gaming classic I mean like at going like who cares about a VHS it's nine I think they sell them for like nine or ten dollars or something and whoever's buying them is absolutely insane because it's a VHS but I don't know forty dollars for a romhack that you can play online for free just so you can play it in your Game Boy in your game boy advance and like know in the back of your head that like the guy selling it is not the guy who created it right just like it like it x me more than losing at clash Royale yeah it's it's pretty shady it really is like you said it's it's it's like fan art but when like I'm buying a Pokemon print from an artist it's very cool to be like oh you did this like you did this art you put the time into it like yeah you don't own the copyright to Bulbasaur and yeah you're probably only selling them at these shows and you're probably gonna make you know a couple bucks but like to me it's like I'm not buying it because it's not buying it because I liked it and because it's something I like like pokemon but like a more of like here's the money for your time in your art not so much like here's some money for ripping off somebody and that's that's a really good analogy for it it's like if you were running an art booth and you went online and googled pokemon fan art and then printed out a bunch of stuff and sold Prince like that's that's pretty much what this guys doing yeah yeah that was probably the the most shocking thing amid waseem in classic however let me say there are that is that's one specific incense amongst everything else that's going on there and in the vendor hall and stuff like that I don't want that to overshadow the fact that there are a lot of really really awesome vendors there too and a lot of really amazing you know independent projects that people have booths in the vendor hall to to sell and showcase their own work to like one of the things that I saw that was a really awesome and be really um kind of a perfect fit for this convention was I think the comp the the company is called retro tainment or maybe cash in culture but they had a game called haunted Halloween 85 and it's it was a retro like an 8-bit Nintendo retro game that they made uh and they released it only on NES cartridges that they that they bought and they published it as a Nintendo game as an NES game to like this year and I thought that was really cool and it was also a really really good fit for that convention because not only is it a new game but it also has all the culture that you find at Midwest gaming classica that people go to midwest gaming classic for and they had a really cool booth in the vendor hall they're really really nice guys and you know it's just it's unfortunate that you then go to other portions of the vendor hall and you see some of the shadier things happening yeah unfortunately too i mean i'm guessing the guy that was selling the rom hacks and stuff probably walked away with way more money than those guys did but you know can't win them all can't win them all that being said though there is a lot of really awesome stuff going on in the vendor hall aside from the shady stuff that's going on too yeah it's it's a it's an interesting show and it's a like you said earlier it's it's gotten way bigger i think the space it I it's been said probably for three years straight and I'd like the space is too small for the amount of people that it draws in having us having a new room was it was refreshing but it was also frustrating he was like we know how busy this convention is and now we're with a smaller room like it's great that we're in a different room to like you know just to mix things up and to try something different but this room is too tiny and I don't know I think i was i was telling irene this and and my friend k and i gotta i gotta give a shout out to k because k comes all the way from Michigan he's been coming since i started going the midwest game classic the 66 year he hasn't missed it the last two years he's he's helped me set up to help me tear down he brings an extra TV in case I needs it I need it he brings extra Pokemon games and nintendo 64 like he brought his wii u this year so we could hook up poke in and have liked to poke ins connected through ethernet which probably on our next episode i'll explain what a headache that was but big big shout-out to k like what a great dude and i know you listen to podcast but like just got to give him a shout out what I was what I was saying to them was like it's so weird and they could just be because the know the kvetching has gotten so big or like or you know the convention is very like you know what to expect like these guys are always here those guys are always there like these vendors always return pokémon podcast is always downstairs in the basement but like you know what to expect so like the first two or three years I felt like our room was so hot cast focused where people would come in they would ask about the podcast they would grab a business card we would sell some t-shirts or some buttons or some stickers related to the podcast some people would stay for pokemon stadium you know some people would do some pokemon snap like there was a real good ebb and flow in the room this year it was almost like none of that I don't know many people that came in to like specifically asked about the podcast like when you're sitting in the room and you see people walk by you always hear like Midwest gaming Pokemon podcast oh that's where the pokemon stuff is oh and they would either come in or they would keep walking and obviously that's normal like not in a Pokemon you're not going to come in maybe I'm putting too much emphasis on playing old pokemon games or playing pokin where I don't know like I I'm there for the podcast at the end of the day right and people playing pokin is really cool but like they're not walking out with a business card and I i I'm not telling people to come in and like buy a shirt by these two dollars shirts because I'm trying to get rid of them cuz they're the pun is no longer funny um but there's something that kind of like deep down bothers me that like these are my TV's these are my we use this is my game this is my controller like everything is mine and people come in and they play it and they leave and cool they have a smile on my face but like my enjoyment would have been like oh you run a podcast can I get a business card and it's like maybe if I take all that away and just have the room and we talked about this Mike and I talked about this of like do I even want to do this next year like due to bring all my stuff is one thing to like keep people entertained and to like be there but like to dedicate my time is also probably more valuable than any of that right like to spend the entire day friday setting up to spend the entire day saturday like i have to be there by nine i have to stay there till eight I have friends that coming out of town for this and like yeah we can get dinner we can maybe do one or two things but then I got to go to bed because I gotta do it all again on Sunday and then said well Sunday it ends at five we can do more and it's like well no I got a teardown and I'm completely exhausted after that and it's like on monday i just want to sleep in because i have zero sleep and the week up to that is just me planning making sure i have like change and all the cables and stupid stuff that I probably would have forgotten even if I made a huge list 50 hours more than 72 hours of my week to go into watching somebody play pokin and walking out is that worth my time yeah and when we talked about it that's kind of what i would say i mean i have a little bit of a different opinion of it because i mean i think i've brought it up when i was on the show way back but that's mgc is how I found you like that's how i found the podcast that's how i started listening what was it 33 years you're however long ago now like that was the first time that I saw you in the Midwest gaming classic and I was so amazed that somebody had a room entirely dedicated to Pokemon and I grabbed that little card that's how I started listening to the podcast so I can see that some people can find it confide in the podcast that way and that's that's great that there are some people that are maybe finding it that didn't know that it existed before like I did but for the most part it seems like the last couple years mgc has really just become it's mostly just become a vendor hall and kind of like a museum showcase where people sometimes go to show off their product or you know their project or whatever it is that they they're coming to showcase like you do with the Pokemon podcast and that fighting game those guys have been there multiple years now they do it's kind of like old-school Mortal Kombat games where it's like live-action animation those guys have been there so many years and I have to wonder how many people even talk to them about their project anymore and how many people just come in just to play it those all of those rooms in the block that you were in this year it's it's almost like anybody that's they're checking anything out it's just a museum to them they come in they look around they play it they don't talk to the person who's running the room and then they leave and they move on to the next room and it's it's you know I guess it's it's almost like that culture just doesn't seem to really fit the the the maker culture I guess anymore so yeah it it's weird like it it pains me to be like I don't want to do mgc because I feel like mgc is like one of like the things that Pokemon podcast does every year I speak at c2e2 every year and I absolutely love that and I go to mgc and I run a room where people come in and they're like this is really cool and hopefully they leave with knowing that i run a podcast or like i do i tried to do cool things and i didn't feel that at all this year and that's not to say like i had people come in that has come in from year to year and they're like love the show this episode was really funny or i liked when you told that wrestling story or like there were a handful of people that did that like that and that means the world to me like it feels so great to like meet somebody in person that goes I listen to your show and I enjoy it and it's like wow awesome cool like this is why I'm here for the weekend but that was so far and few between compared to last year's it was just right very a bit is very heavy and really I think you know this it kind of fuels my opinion that it needs to move it needs to be somewhere that feels more like a convent and les like les like a showcase because that's really all it is now even even when they have people you know doing talks and stuff like that it's in a bar there it's at the bar in a restaurant in the in the inside the hotel restaurant that's open to the entire hallway and so many people are walking through that nobody is paying attention to the talks and the few people that are paying attention to the talks probably can't hear what they're saying very well it's probably not a really good environment for having a talk or you know and I think if it moved if it went somewhere else and it was it was kind of refreshed that would help it a lot unfortunately I don't think that that's really after 15 years of this I don't think that that's really gonna happen you know it's it's it feels like it's always going to be walking into a museum an interactive museum buying stuff that is in some cases kind of questionable and just walking through a hotel hallway if they could change that I could see that being really beneficial to people like yourself or other makers want to show off their products or their projects but until there's some sort of change in the format it's just not conducive to getting people interested I guess because they're not there to be interested in something they're there to play the same you know play old pinball stuff that they haven't seen in a long time or play old uh you know super nintendo games that they haven't seen in a really long time or in a lot of cases it's parents who are not really there to you know see anything new their whole reason for being there is that they're bringing their kids to show them the games that they played when they were a kid you know and they're not there to be interested in new projects or you know stuff like that I guess it to some degree some of it is not going to change and that's probably okay for a lot for a lot of the people there you know a lot of the consumers that are there but the people that are actually running it repeated the people that are actively involved in it like yourself and like the the haunted Halloween guys and stuff like that you know it's not really conducive to them to for what their you know their reason for being there is yeah I already have like a million things running through my head of like next year or like what am I going to do next here am I going to go back next year and it's like I feel like I can't get my old room back feel like that's off the table because it's like why would the people that are now in it give it up right I think about the smaller room and I think about what went wrong and what we're right in the past and and there's a got like a couple things that like I think matter like obviously advertising my podcast and like making sure that people know that like you said it when you were outside the door this is the Pokemon podcast room and I think the podcast gets forgotten when he walk-in yeah but like I do have the the arcade machine that i built the pinball machine mm-hmm and i think that is a showpiece that sticks out at any convention i would take it too right I think maybe mayor marrying the fact that like I've worked with a ton of artists before and I'm sure those artists would like to get their work out and I would be more than happy to be like let's build a wall inside this room of all your guys's art and let me sell it for you and like give back to the artists that have done stuff for me the past like I think that would be really cool mm-hmm because running pokemon stadium 2 every year is just not working and there were a lot of people that came in that we're excited about you know seeing the art that was there and the stickers and stuff like that you know there were a couple people who were specifically really excited about the splatoon pokemon mashup stickers and that was really cool to see and you still did have you know a good handful of people that came in and were either listeners or hadn't heard about it before and we're asking questions about it and stuff like that the two things that stick out in my mind were the dad with his son and daughter who came in and they were referencing old jokes from the podcast and you were like it's always surreal to me that people remember you know or when people are telling me jokes that come from the podcast in person and then the kid and his mom who came in and they had said that they you know listen to the podcast and stuff like that and that the one kid who specifically was asking uh for information on what was it shinier also I think oh yeah he's trying to figure out how to give shut your mouth shout out to that kid there's no easy answer for that so it's it's really cool this to see that from you know the did the volunteer side of of the Pokemon podcast room but you know when it's all said and done I think maybe the takeaway is that it's it it comes across more as like a you know a showcase I guess and that's just generally the the show I think I don't know that that's necessarily just on your part but just the culture of that show mmm yeah whereas you know four years ago it wasn't so much like that right well Wow to be honest I didn't think we'd be talking this long but Midwest in a classic but I don't want to say about OMG see you put Mike and I in a room we could talk forever it's true about anything we'll just never shut up I do want to touch on Michael is not here for this he was I think you're streaming forget what you're streaming um but uh last night at Tuesday night oh yeah yeah I was quantum break yeah quantum break I ran a Pokemon movie night I ran that on a service called rabbit have you heard of rabbit Micah I have we actually I have a discord server for viewers of the the the twitch channel my twitch channel and we have a specific section in the discord server called squared circle and we occasionally will watch wrestling on rabbit together yeah well Irene discovered rabbit about a month ago and she she uses it like every single night watching with other people so for our listeners that don't know how it works rabbit it's our a BB dot IT that's the website but they pronounce it rabbit because they reached out to me and we I talked with him a little bit but it you the host let's just say me would log into rabbit I would pick something to watch and it can auto connect to youtube I believe it can connect to netflix it connect to HBO GO I don't know how or why this is legal by the way speaking same question speaking of legality because I know when you like buy a DVD like you get the warning that says like only you can watch this DVD because you purchased the viewing license right of the DVD I'm not totally sure here we were talking a this uh when we were talking when WrestleMania was coming up because the people that I typically watch wrestling with were like oh we should watch wrestlemania together and rabbit and I was like well it doesn't say that you know the network is something that you can pull up through rabbit but when you're in rabbit you're essentially just using a browser so i don't know if you can just look at anything you should i would imagine be able to just go anywhere right yeah i think so cuz when you hit the hulu button it just bring some cuckoo oh right just brings up a browser yes i don't i don't know exactly how it works but anyways so if i'm the host I up a movie and then I get a link and then I send that link out and people click it and then they join the room and once they join your rabbit room there's a chat window on the side that everyone can start chatting in but you can also have the option to turn on everyone's voice or if the person wants their voice on and a video feed of them so if you're watching the movie you can have like like everyone's face video face like at the bottom and like everyone could be talking over the movie and stuff and I didn't want that for our first rabbit we just kept it to chat but on Tuesday we watch a Pokemon Arceus and the jewel of life it was the first time I saw that movie and there was a rabbit can hold 25 people i believe and we had to turn out of at about 17 people give or take you know a couple that came in and came out later you know how to leave early but it was really fun like it was I I probable probably do a whole episode later dedicated on the movie itself and I think you guys have enjoyed that in the past when I did a whole episode or what's the ricasso modesta needy axis and then I did one for the Victini movie i'll probably do one for Arceus in the jewel of life just today but yeah so people came in for rabbit we watched the movie we chatted there was a lot of jokes that came out of it it was it was really fun like it was the fat the movies 90 minutes and wouldn't boy to time just fly by it was really really awesome everyone in the chat was really cool everyone was really funny I was laughing the entire time the movie itself was actually really good one of the better pokemon movies i would i would argue with anyone that it was very good not a lot of ash but a lot of pokemon and that's that's all you can ask for in a Pokemon really that's the formula for the perfect Pokemon movie minimize ash bring up the total dials yeah it was it was a good movie it was a good time we will be probably doing another rabbit Pokemon movie night let me let me pull out my calendar real quick I just want to make sure that I get you guys the right date for the record I just pulled it up just to see and it is just a browser then you can go anywhere on it okay yeah I pull up whatever you are do not know how that is legal but okay um it's essentially screen sharing but on like a larger scale I guess yeah and not with your own computer so we will be doing another movie night on Friday april 22nd so about a week from when this podcast is published i will it will probably be around eight to nine p.m. central time i don't know the exact time but we'll do it on the friday night so more people can attend because obviously tuesday night was a little it's a weird night to stream a movie they'll do it on friday night it's limited to 24 people because obviously me being the host counts as one of the 25 the ten-dollar backers on slack the community backers will get first access i think there's 10 of them and then the rest of the slack will get access to the movie night first come first serve and then if that doesn't fill up we'll send the link to twitter and facebook so like said we had about it we had to turn out about 18 people last time very last minute but it was it was a lot of fun and everyone everyone in chat was like let's watch another movie right now and i was like no guys we there are only 18 pokemon movies we cannot burn through all of them in one night we got a space this out got minimize it more or less is more yeah so if you're just watching a Pokemon movie and participating in a hilarious jokes i think i'm funny sometimes April 22nd will be our next movie night and yeah stuff like this wouldn't really be possible without our patreon backers though I want to give them want to give them a shout out it's a really cool thing to rear you know it's it's something that I found recently too and it's it's it's a really cool way to connect with people and if there's any other Pokemon podcast trying to stream movies of a rabbit I just want to lay it out here that we did this first I will burn that fresh right probably watch all the movies with more rational yea yea though they'll watch the Scilla be movie thanks for that that was a point of contention in the car during boom mochi gear the Midwest game classic the sum of movies not good it got pretty heated I mean the end of the movie redeems the first terribleness that we called the first 30 minutes I just really like Celebi and that's really all that I have for that discussion I mean it is an onion no one's hating you they're good at good ol onion pokémon yes so there we ran out of ideas so if if you're interested in watching a Pokemon movie you have any questions you can just you can hit me up on Twitter you can DM me and slack either one of those options is fine but plan for mark your calendars for April 22nd hopefully we can fill the room this this next time and then in times in the future I don't I I could keep talking tonight I'm not like I'm on I'm on an energy high at 1am but we should we should wrap it up cuz I only hold you Micah dad to be half hour but here we are ramble i mean i can i'm in the same position this is like this is like my 9am so shout out to all the third shifters uh that are wide awake right now what's uh what's on your agenda for the weekend you you streaming some more I'm gonna try and finish quantum break tomorrow I think what's obviously date is mr. this forum Thursday night I'm gonna try and finish quantum break I believe it's only about an eight to nine our game and we put about five or six in Tuesday night so I think we can probably finish it in one night and I'm looking forward to finishing that and then I I kind of want to check out the new ratchet and clank I've seen a lot of people a lot of other people playing it and I've never really been interested in series before but it's kind of a reboot so I feel like this is a good entry point I was kind of itching to play it but I think I'll just wait for the movie is it is it like a movie game I don't totally understand what's going on here so the new ratchet and clank game is based on the movie that comes out at the end of the month right but the movie is based on the very first retching clanking okay the movie is based on the game but the game is based on the movie got it really confusing but I got there very from from what I've heard from reviews and other podcasts this discussion the game is very self aware that is it is based on a movie which is based on the game which is ultimately a remake but not quite a remake because there because it's based on a movie it sounds like my kind of confusion yes so I may do that but Dark Souls 3 also came out I heard that was having a lot of problems it is that's kind of why I'm staying away from it for the time being because the last thing the things that I've been playing the most in the last couple months have been dark souls 1 in Dark Souls 2 because I'd never completed them before and I wanted to finish them before three came out so 13 came out a lot of people a lot of viewers were like why aren't you playing dark souls 3 but I've heard that a lot of people are having some ma known glitch issues with the game um so I'm gonna kind of maybe wait that out until some of that stuff is patched but that's on the horizon as well of course next week is Star Fox zero so that have you may be a thing may may be a thing well we'll see well if you guys listening to this on thursday sometime because this episode will come out on thursday april 14th i will be streaming poking tournament again like i have been every thursday me and my boy Blaziken have kicked Machamp to the curb if you want to get on that sceptile game man now screw septa Christmas tree city so if you want to join in on that that will be on Twitch starts at eight p.m. central time the vr vs vr vs code is just P cam and cast all lower case and we usually have a good turnout for that we usually have 20 or so people playing poker in tournament with us and I lose a lot but it's still fun definitely getting better at that we will be back for dungeons and dragon knights on Tuesday Greg will return from his honeymoon that will be Tuesday April nineteenth so at seven p.m. central time that'll be episode 7 of dungeons and dragon eyes and we're kind of pinning down about 10 to 12 episodes of that depending on how much of story we get through per episode we'll we'll refine that and then once that season is over we'll take a will take a a month or so off and just kind of rework things for season 2 because that has been a little more successful than i originally imagined and it does very well in itunes which is great because other people have found it super effective because of dungeons recognize just because it it's hitting a different audience it's unique it's a very very unique take on just standard Dungeons and Dragons yeah yeah i think it's it's fun to do I look forward to it but it's a it's like crazy cuz I'm like reading off this calendar of like Oh Mike we're doing this on Tuesday we're doing this on Thursday and on Friday we're doing this movie night and it's like Pokemon back i was doing a lot of with a lot of things a week now yep which is a little exhausting i got i have to get my final fantasy 14 at my destiny and and my classroom I gotta get this all in before Pokemon Sun and Moon but I think that will that will wrap things up for today's show I mean I could keep talking but I gotta edit this and get it out to you guys so I think that's kind of important as well ah editing to edit man we just you know no edits put it up call it raw that's raw comedy you're hearing right here we'd want to edit out our rock but raw raw content just it's the best I'm not going to harsh on any podcast but if you say that you do not want to edit because you think that rock comedy is funnier I hate to break it to you just clean it up a little bit all right this and and that that's that's to any podcast that is not picking on any specific topic or genre that is to any podcast like editing is super important you know it's just professionalism just make it make it look make it sound professional this is like this is the part of podcast I purposely put in like huge like blanks space between us talking it sounds like really awkward well I think I think that wraps it up Micah where your twitch streamer work in our listeners uh watch your face you can find me behind the bar at the tavern usually five five nights a week Monday through Friday starting around 8 p.m. central time at twitch.tv / Mike of the brave and you can also find me on twitter at twitter.com/worldsdumbest I'm to cut it off no one needs to hear that fantastic end credits that is now different by the way but if you had oh that unless you stick around that's right but if you haven't done so already I would appreciate you to leave a review in itunes for the show it helps other people find the show it helps boost us in itunes we've been doing really well we want to keep that momentum going for Pokemon Sun and Moon so that would help a lot to just leave a review otherwise thank you guys so much for listening we will be back on our normal schedule this coming week so expect a show on Monday the 18th of April expect one around their natural morning or night depends on when we get when we get that recorded and edited but expected around that date normal schedule I am at dragonlake on Twitter Micah's at Mike of the brave on Twitter this
