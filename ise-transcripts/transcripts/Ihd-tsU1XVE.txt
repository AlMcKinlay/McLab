week before we go back to the sunday the (0:50 - 0:56)
normal sunday recordings especially (0:54 - 0:58)

to record so here we are but before (1:01 - 1:08)
before we dive in to midwest gaming (1:04 - 1:10)

midwest game of classic and micah micah (1:12 - 1:17)
is here because Michael was at Midwest (1:14 - 1:19)
game classic with myself so we're just (1:17 - 1:22)

i'll just probably touch on the movie (1:22 - 1:26)
night that i had a out the other night (1:23 - 1:29)
with with some of the patreon backers (1:26 - 1:31)

we'll touch on that but how was your (1:31 - 1:36)
week Micah how's your weekend how's your (1:34 - 1:39)
week my weekend was loaded with classic (1:36 - 1:43)
games the end pokemon the classiest (1:39 - 1:46)
classiest of classic games it was good (1:43 - 1:49)
and then the week's been you know this (1:46 - 1:52)
busy busy and exhausting you've been (1:49 - 1:55)
streaming I have been I actually didn't (1:52 - 1:58)
stream tonight because as you know I got (1:55 - 2:02)
hung up and but I streams last night and (1:58 - 2:07)
we played quantum break which is a very (2:02 - 2:09)
unique and very interesting game are you (2:07 - 2:12)
liking it I am that's it is really (2:09 - 2:15)
interesting by the people who did uh (2:12 - 2:18)
Alan Wake yeah correct you yep Remedy (2:15 - 2:21)
Entertainment they did they do something (2:18 - 2:23)
really unique with this game where it's (2:21 - 2:25)
very choice based so at the end of each (2:23 - 2:28)
chapter you have about probably 2-3 (2:25 - 2:30)
hours of gameplay and then at the end of (2:28 - 2:33)
the chapter you make a crucial (2:30 - 2:37)
for the story and you have two options (2:33 - 2:39)
you pick one and then they give you (2:37 - 2:43)
about a 22 minute long live action (2:39 - 2:47)
episode that changes depending on what (2:43 - 2:49)
choices you've made throughout the game (2:47 - 2:53)
and I'm sure you've seen a lot of the (2:49 - 2:56)
characters are there acted like voice (2:53 - 3:01)
acted and face models for the kid from (2:56 - 3:04)
actual actors a little finger from Game (3:01 - 3:06)
of Thrones is one of them and I think (3:04 - 3:08)
everybody was saying Iceman from x-men (3:06 - 3:10)
but I don't really know who that guy is (3:08 - 3:15)
so mr. translates really well yes mr. (3:10 - 3:18)
freeze from batman forever or is that (3:15 - 3:22)
Batman Robin our lair I think batman (3:18 - 3:26)
forever I just like us to meet you will (3:22 - 3:28)
brendel the biggest Batman fan in the (3:26 - 3:31)
world is probably yelling at his iphone (3:28 - 3:34)
right now that we don't know that man (3:31 - 3:37)
breeze to meet you know it's really good (3:34 - 3:39)
though they it's it's a really unique (3:37 - 3:43)
take on on it's an interesting format (3:39 - 3:46)
that I haven't really seen before um and (3:43 - 3:48)
some people really liked it some people (3:46 - 3:50)
were kind of like I don't really want to (3:48 - 3:53)
watch 22 minute long cutscene just let (3:50 - 3:55)
me play the game but it was kind of neat (3:53 - 3:56)
I turned off the webcam and I turned off (3:55 - 3:58)
the mic and we just SAT and watched it (3:56 - 3:59)
and talked about it in chat it was a (3:58 - 4:03)
good time cool cool so far so good it's (3:59 - 4:06)
a very beautiful game I have not been (4:03 - 4:08)
playing quantum break but I have been (4:06 - 4:13)
been playing a lot of clash Royale the (4:08 - 4:19)
old clash regal and boys that game (4:13 - 4:22)
frustrating there's like something we (4:19 - 4:24)
I've talked about clash Royale before on (4:22 - 4:27)
on the show but diving deeper into it (4:24 - 4:31)
and now spending spending money money (4:27 - 4:33)
what with it there's like this (4:31 - 4:36)
commitment now that I have of trying to (4:33 - 4:40)
get good as as the kids would say yes (4:36 - 4:43)
the kids would say and say (4:40 - 4:46)
and it good and it's funny because you (4:43 - 4:50)
know I was never a clash of clans player (4:46 - 4:54)
like I understand the the appeal I (4:50 - 4:58)
understand the the shady business of it (4:54 - 5:02)
I understand the money sink that it is (4:58 - 5:04)
and I understand that a lot of people (5:02 - 5:06)
play it without spending any money I (5:04 - 5:09)
totally get that I was back in the day (5:06 - 5:12)
big simpsons tapped out fan I think (5:09 - 5:16)
throughout that that mobile game (5:12 - 5:18)
lifetime I probably put two hundred (5:16 - 5:20)
dollars or so into it and it was very (5:18 - 5:23)
like it was very like I'm limiting (5:20 - 5:25)
myself to ten dollars a week and then it (5:23 - 5:27)
came to like well now they had the (5:25 - 5:29)
scratch-off ticket so I'm going to do (5:27 - 5:31)
one scratch off ticket a day that's only (5:29 - 5:32)
one dollar a day that's only seven (5:31 - 5:35)
dollars a week and if something's on (5:32 - 5:37)
sale you know it's on sale so i can (5:35 - 5:39)
splurge a little this week i'll put (5:37 - 5:41)
twenty dollars this is how i got to two (5:39 - 5:43)
hundred dollars you know fast forward to (5:41 - 5:49)
clash Royale which is more of a I'll (5:43 - 5:50)
just explain it right sits like at our (5:49 - 5:53)
offense game our defense but more of (5:50 - 5:55)
taking out their towers in order to win (5:53 - 5:58)
while defending your towers and you (5:55 - 6:00)
build a deck of you build a deck of (5:58 - 6:03)
eight different cards and as you go you (6:00 - 6:06)
get a lot of free cards in a day you if (6:03 - 6:08)
there's timers for three our chests and (6:06 - 6:09)
when you open the chest i think you get (6:08 - 6:12)
like 20 or 30 cards and you can put (6:09 - 6:15)
those cards and infuse them and they (6:12 - 6:16)
become stronger and then your deck (6:15 - 6:19)
overall becomes stronger and it's player (6:16 - 6:20)
versus player you're always playing a (6:19 - 6:22)
human and i think that that probably (6:20 - 6:26)
adds a lot to my anger that comes with (6:22 - 6:31)
the game of like I know that it's a (6:26 - 6:33)
human and when I make a mistake like i (6:31 - 6:37)
feel that like i am better than this and (6:33 - 6:38)
i'm better than this person on the other (6:37 - 6:41)
side of the screen and like when they (6:38 - 6:43)
make a mistake that feels like really (6:41 - 6:45)
good because you know computers usually (6:43 - 6:47)
don't make mistakes and you know humans (6:45 - 6:50)
do and so I've sunk some money into it (6:47 - 6:53)
which i think is fine and there's a lot (6:50 - 6:55)
of people that are like I'll never put (6:53 - 6:57)
money into it but I think you come (6:55 - 6:58)
from a magic background of me coming (6:57 - 7:00)
from a Pokemon background there's a lot (6:58 - 7:03)
of like we spent a lot of money oh god (7:00 - 7:07)
the time to get like four cards in our (7:03 - 7:09)
deck that would embarrassing amount of (7:07 - 7:11)
money that will be obsolete in three (7:09 - 7:15)
months or six months or yep like like I (7:11 - 7:16)
bought two tropical beaches and there (7:15 - 7:18)
were a hundred dollars each for a deck (7:16 - 7:20)
that Iran at a tournament and then (7:18 - 7:23)
afterwards those cards dropped to eighty (7:20 - 7:24)
dollars and was like wow i could sell (7:23 - 7:26)
noun take a forty dollar loss on these (7:24 - 7:28)
two cards and eventually they went up to (7:26 - 7:30)
120 and then they went back down they (7:28 - 7:33)
went back up mm-hmm well we talked a (7:30 - 7:35)
little bit about this i don't remember (7:33 - 7:37)
who it was wit i think it was with our (7:35 - 7:40)
friend alex and we were talking about (7:37 - 7:44)
the value the resale value and the one (7:40 - 7:47)
thing that I I said that I kind of have (7:44 - 7:50)
a problem justifying mobile game stuff (7:47 - 7:52)
like this is that there's not much of (7:50 - 7:54)
their even with physical card games (7:52 - 7:56)
there's always somewhat of a resale (7:54 - 7:58)
value at least with magic especially (7:56 - 8:01)
because they have things like legacy (7:58 - 8:03)
formats where cards that are no longer (8:01 - 8:08)
legal in the the most current you know (8:03 - 8:11)
current card set formats people still (8:08 - 8:12)
run those cards in other formats so they (8:11 - 8:15)
still have value to some degree and so (8:12 - 8:19)
even if I get tired of whatever in play (8:15 - 8:20)
if I get tired of magic or whatever it (8:19 - 8:23)
is I can offload everything that I have (8:20 - 8:26)
for at least something you know where (8:23 - 8:29)
with a mobile game I feel like there's (8:26 - 8:31)
no opportunity really to do that the (8:29 - 8:34)
money's gone you know but that being (8:31 - 8:39)
said I did you with your incredible (8:34 - 8:41)
ability to get convinced people to play (8:39 - 8:44)
the mobile games that you're playing I (8:41 - 8:47)
did over the course of the mgc weekend i (8:44 - 8:50)
downloaded clash royale I didn't touch (8:47 - 8:52)
it really I played a little bit of this (8:50 - 8:54)
tutorial and then Monday what we were (8:52 - 8:58)
watching Monday Night Raw I picked it up (8:54 - 9:00)
again and played it and I've actually (8:58 - 9:02)
been playing it pretty consistently I (9:00 - 9:04)
haven't put any money into it yet but (9:02 - 9:07)
I'm actually really enjoying it it's (9:04 - 9:10)
it's interesting to me how much (9:07 - 9:13)
hey how much it's like hearthstone yes (9:10 - 9:15)
and also how different it is from (9:13 - 9:17)
hearthstone I agree I agree a hundred (9:15 - 9:19)
percent with both your points and I (9:17 - 9:22)
think that's why I almost like it more (9:19 - 9:23)
than hearthstone yeah there are a lot of (9:22 - 9:28)
mechanics that really take the that (9:23 - 9:31)
hearth stone inspiration and then make (9:28 - 9:33)
it its own and making a new experience (9:31 - 9:34)
and kind of refresh it which is really (9:33 - 9:37)
nice but the thing that was the most (9:34 - 9:41)
distinct to me was how uninvested I was (9:37 - 9:44)
going through the tutorial and still (9:41 - 9:46)
pretty generally skeptical while I was (9:44 - 9:48)
playing me tutorial and then the second (9:46 - 9:51)
that I was playing real people it hit me (9:48 - 9:54)
and it picked up really fast it got (9:51 - 9:57)
really uh like nerve-racking really (9:54 - 9:59)
quickly and I started to get really (9:57 - 10:04)
salty yo and also really uh really (9:59 - 10:06)
heated about how well I wanted to do (10:04 - 10:08)
yeah there was so I've been playing (10:06 - 10:11)
probably probably for three weeks and I (10:08 - 10:13)
would and I've had the game for a month (10:11 - 10:16)
in the first the first week it was kind (10:13 - 10:18)
of the same experiences you i downloaded (10:16 - 10:20)
I played a little bit and then I was (10:18 - 10:22)
like I don't see the appeal I don't see (10:20 - 10:23)
why it's number one in the app store I (10:22 - 10:27)
mean it's not bad i just didn't see what (10:23 - 10:28)
made it so special and then eventually I (10:27 - 10:30)
came back to it just because I was like (10:28 - 10:32)
there was down time I need to do (10:30 - 10:34)
something let's fry clash royal again (10:32 - 10:35)
and I was like oh this chest is done oh (10:34 - 10:37)
look at all these new cards and (10:35 - 10:39)
modifying my deck and now like I'm (10:37 - 10:42)
winning and I went through like uh you (10:39 - 10:43)
know less than a week I got to a (10:42 - 10:46)
thousand trophies which is it whatever (10:43 - 10:49)
it is what it is and then for two weeks (10:46 - 10:51)
I struggled that a thousand and twelve (10:49 - 10:54)
hundred and now in this last week I've (10:51 - 10:58)
pushed up to 1,800 trophies which to me (10:54 - 11:00)
was like a huge couch accomplishment I (10:58 - 11:02)
felt really good I almost made it to (11:00 - 11:04)
2000 today I was just a couple points (11:02 - 11:06)
couple trophies shy of that and then (11:04 - 11:10)
like today during dinner I dropped down (11:06 - 11:13)
to 1700 and like I was so frustrated I (11:10 - 11:16)
was so disappointed in myself that I (11:13 - 11:18)
went I had like a three hundred trophy (11:16 - 11:22)
span and I was games usually don't make (11:18 - 11:24)
me that mad like I lose all (11:22 - 11:25)
time to poke in on stream and it's it's (11:24 - 11:28)
fine like I shake my head I laughs I (11:25 - 11:29)
play the next game i'm still having fun (11:28 - 11:32)
and i'm not saying i'm not having fun (11:29 - 11:34)
with clash Royale but like it has such a (11:32 - 11:38)
competitive I I know I'm right like I (11:34 - 11:40)
know what I did wrong and I'm not I'm (11:38 - 11:42)
just mad at myself for messing up like (11:40 - 11:45)
when I like launch arrows to take out a (11:42 - 11:47)
minion horde and I timed it one second (11:45 - 11:49)
to short and my arrows with I like know (11:47 - 11:52)
at that moment in time I just lost the (11:49 - 11:54)
match because of one miss play I just (11:52 - 11:58)
did yeah and you kind of get that in (11:54 - 12:00)
pokemon and magic like oh I miss played (11:58 - 12:02)
i'm probably going to lose but at the (12:00 - 12:04)
same time with pokemon and magic you're (12:02 - 12:06)
like well i just drew bad like i just (12:04 - 12:08)
didn't start off good and you don't (12:06 - 12:10)
really get that feeling in clash Royale (12:08 - 12:13)
and I you and I think that's why I like (12:10 - 12:14)
it more than her stone cuz with her (12:13 - 12:16)
stone it's like oh I drew bad and in (12:14 - 12:19)
clash Royale like you have used draw (12:16 - 12:20)
four cards and there's a cards in the (12:19 - 12:24)
deck so like yeah you can go I drew bad (12:20 - 12:26)
but like you're gonna see all the cards (12:24 - 12:28)
in like the next twenty second right (12:26 - 12:30)
yeah and I actually really like that I (12:28 - 12:32)
like that it then it cycles through (12:30 - 12:35)
everything so you see the majority of (12:32 - 12:39)
your deck within the time span of the (12:35 - 12:43)
match you know yeah yeah I like I really (12:39 - 12:46)
like the style I guess III I don't know (12:43 - 12:49)
it's it's hard to say it's it's weird (12:46 - 12:52)
too because I'm generally not anybody (12:49 - 12:54)
that would be interested in a tower (12:52 - 12:58)
defense but it's just enough of that (12:54 - 13:02)
card game influence to make me want to (12:58 - 13:06)
play it to to get me interested in it (13:02 - 13:09)
which is which is surprising for me that (13:06 - 13:12)
I got is into something that's probably (13:09 - 13:14)
kind of primarily tower to tower defense (13:12 - 13:16)
one that's not something I would ever (13:14 - 13:18)
play really and that was the big turnoff (13:16 - 13:20)
for me initially when I was watching you (13:18 - 13:21)
play it and you were telling me about it (13:20 - 13:23)
and stuff I was like I've got tower (13:21 - 13:25)
defense it's not something that I can (13:23 - 13:29)
really get into but you do you get that (13:25 - 13:33)
hog rider yet no hog rider yet not yet (13:29 - 13:36)
have you faced some hog riders and I (13:33 - 13:37)
don't think so I mean I'm (13:36 - 13:42)
pretty early yeah but it's it's you know (13:37 - 13:44)
I'm at a point now where I'm playing (13:42 - 13:49)
real people and getting really upset one (13:44 - 13:52)
it's so close that I just barely take (13:49 - 13:54)
out their second tower before time runs (13:52 - 13:57)
out yeah well going back to what I was (13:54 - 14:00)
saying before before I ranted like i sat (13:57 - 14:02)
at you know a thousand to 1200 for (14:00 - 14:04)
almost two weeks and now I don't really (14:02 - 14:07)
fall below 1,700 like today was the (14:04 - 14:10)
first day in a week I really fell below (14:07 - 14:12)
1700 and usually I've been sitting at (14:10 - 14:15)
1809 I got back to 1800 before the (14:12 - 14:17)
podcast but I was I had to like calm (14:15 - 14:19)
myself down and go like like look at (14:17 - 14:21)
what you have accomplished in the matter (14:19 - 14:24)
of like five to seven days like you made (14:21 - 14:25)
this huge jump you broke through this (14:24 - 14:28)
wall you almost made it two thousand (14:25 - 14:29)
today and now you're bumped back down (14:28 - 14:31)
but like you're not really bumped back (14:29 - 14:34)
down like I still made that progress so (14:31 - 14:36)
like that that at the debt that at the (14:34 - 14:37)
end of the day is kind of exciting (14:36 - 14:40)
because it's like I do have progress i (14:37 - 14:42)
could show like hopefully i can break (14:40 - 14:44)
that two thousand while and then get (14:42 - 14:45)
into tournaments and stuff because like (14:44 - 14:47)
i really like the game and that's why i (14:45 - 14:48)
don't mind buying new cards because it's (14:47 - 14:51)
it's exciting like it's cool it's it's (14:48 - 14:54)
it's a great game and for we have a we (14:51 - 14:57)
have we have a pkmn cast iron in it and (14:54 - 14:58)
it's floor right now you can have 50 (14:57 - 15:01)
members in a clan so if you're listening (14:58 - 15:02)
and you're in the clan and you don't (15:01 - 15:04)
play clash royale probably gonna have to (15:02 - 15:07)
kick you out because when you're (15:04 - 15:10)
exclusive its it plus we have what we (15:07 - 15:11)
have up like mike is that even the clan (15:10 - 15:13)
yet we have other people that that are (15:11 - 15:15)
not in the clan and so like gotta knock (15:13 - 15:17)
out the act in active people so we can (15:15 - 15:21)
trade them hog riders it's called clash (15:17 - 15:26)
Royale okay it's very exclusive the most (15:21 - 15:32)
regal Club the most royale of clashes (15:26 - 15:37)
speaking of Royals this past weekend was (15:32 - 15:41)
the Midwest gaming classic (15:37 - 15:41)
it was definitely a kind of a battle (15:41 - 15:48)
royale so it took place in brookfield (15:45 - 15:50)
Wisconsin like it does every year i (15:48 - 15:52)
think i want to say it's like its eighth (15:50 - 15:55)
or ninth year I don't think it's I don't (15:52 - 15:56)
think it had ten because if it had ten I (15:55 - 15:58)
probably they probably would have done (15:56 - 16:01)
something but I I know that it existed a (15:58 - 16:04)
little bit prior to me starting but this (16:01 - 16:08)
was my sixth year there mmhmm yeah and (16:04 - 16:11)
it was kind of it was it was very (16:08 - 16:13)
different compared to a lot of a lot of (16:11 - 16:17)
past years the the biggest change of (16:13 - 16:21)
hosting a Pokemon podcast room as the (16:17 - 16:24)
signs set outside the door was we were (16:21 - 16:27)
in a different room we were in the (16:24 - 16:30)
community hall in the quote-unquote (16:27 - 16:34)
basement which the base it's not really (16:30 - 16:36)
big I mean it's it is a basement but (16:34 - 16:39)
it's it's we're all like this smaller (16:36 - 16:42)
conference rooms are mm-hmm and I (16:39 - 16:44)
wouldn't say there's two three four or (16:42 - 16:47)
five about six rooms down there and (16:44 - 16:50)
mine's not the smallest but not the (16:47 - 16:53)
biggest and there's like two rooms that (16:50 - 16:54)
are kind of merged together that's (16:53 - 16:56)
across the hall anyways we would a (16:54 - 16:59)
showcase hallway I guess the best way to (16:56 - 17:02)
describe it like it's mostly rooms that (16:59 - 17:05)
people are showcasing their games or (17:02 - 17:08)
other people's games you know like like (17:05 - 17:10)
the virtual reality stuff is always in a (17:08 - 17:12)
showcase room and it's kind of hallway (17:10 - 17:13)
that you walk down and on either side (17:12 - 17:15)
all the way down the hallway it's just (17:13 - 17:17)
different showcases for different games (17:15 - 17:20)
or independent games or you know stuff (17:17 - 17:23)
like that right and so we were down (17:20 - 17:25)
there for the last five years and it was (17:23 - 17:28)
great the room was big the only it's a (17:25 - 17:29)
problem it wasn't that big of a problem (17:28 - 17:32)
was there was this huge like conference (17:29 - 17:34)
table in a room that couldn't really (17:32 - 17:35)
leave the room because it was really (17:34 - 17:38)
awkward it was really big it was screwed (17:35 - 17:40)
together like it would probably take (17:38 - 17:43)
four or five people to move it out the (17:40 - 17:44)
door and then once it got out the door (17:43 - 17:45)
there was really no where to put it (17:44 - 17:47)
mm-hmm it was so big but we took (17:45 - 17:49)
advantage of it we'd put all the TVs on (17:47 - 17:51)
it we'd move it in different spots like (17:49 - 17:53)
we would always try to do something with (17:51 - 17:54)
it and (17:53 - 17:55)
you know there was there's never a (17:54 - 17:57)
problem and I think when we first (17:55 - 18:00)
started having problems with the room (17:57 - 18:03)
was when we started sharing with and (18:00 - 18:06)
then the Nintendo reps because two years (18:03 - 18:07)
ago they approached me and they were (18:06 - 18:10)
like hey we want to come to midwest (18:07 - 18:12)
gaming classic there is no space here (18:10 - 18:15)
every single room is taken we really (18:12 - 18:16)
like what you guys do like obviously (18:15 - 18:18)
you're doing pokemon stuff would it be (18:16 - 18:20)
cool if we set up like two tables in the (18:18 - 18:21)
corner of your room next year and like (18:20 - 18:24)
have a wii u and have some ds's and do (18:21 - 18:25)
some giveaways and I was like yeah (18:24 - 18:27)
absolutely like desert from Nintendo (18:25 - 18:31)
like you're not suing me of course like (18:27 - 18:34)
share the room and that was it was (18:31 - 18:36)
awesome the two guys that run it (18:34 - 18:39)
fantastic very very awesome awesome (18:36 - 18:41)
dudes the problem was because they were (18:39 - 18:43)
in attended a brought in so much traffic (18:41 - 18:48)
that it really made the room not (18:43 - 18:50)
comfortable to be in like some people (18:48 - 18:51)
want to come in they want to sit down (18:50 - 18:53)
they want to play a couple rounds of (18:51 - 18:55)
Pokemon same two they want to play you (18:53 - 18:56)
know 10 15 minutes of pokemon snap they (18:55 - 18:58)
want to do the pokemon pinball they want (18:56 - 19:02)
to do PokePark we have so many different (18:58 - 19:05)
pokemon games going on and we when you (19:02 - 19:06)
have people just coming and coming out (19:05 - 19:08)
for the freebies Nintendo's doing you're (19:06 - 19:11)
blocking the doorway and you're filling (19:08 - 19:13)
the room and so I think we both realize (19:11 - 19:16)
that both parties mm-hmm and we did it (19:13 - 19:18)
again last year what was both of us and (19:16 - 19:20)
it was just almost even worse last year (19:18 - 19:24)
so we both kind of went to the invite (19:20 - 19:26)
people this year and we're like hey this (19:24 - 19:28)
was a scenario last year it was almost (19:26 - 19:31)
like you just give us both separate (19:28 - 19:32)
rooms they could just be a little bit (19:31 - 19:35)
smaller but like we obviously can fill (19:32 - 19:38)
them we've shown you the last five years (19:35 - 19:40)
that you know our rooms are extremely (19:38 - 19:43)
busy and so they're like yeah sure cool (19:40 - 19:46)
here is a new room they actually moved (19:43 - 19:48)
the Nintendo guys across the hall into (19:46 - 19:50)
that big room I described earlier and (19:48 - 19:52)
they got more space I mean they were (19:50 - 19:53)
still sharing with people but they (19:52 - 19:56)
definitely got more space and the (19:53 - 19:58)
Pokemon podcast room got moved upstairs (19:56 - 20:00)
which was exciting something different (19:58 - 20:03)
but the room was significantly smaller (20:00 - 20:06)
and I think I did the best I (20:03 - 20:09)
good working with the space yeah you did (20:06 - 20:11)
for what it was if you if you didn't (20:09 - 20:13)
make it there Steve did a really good (20:11 - 20:17)
job with making it spacious for what it (20:13 - 20:20)
way I mean imagine all of the rooms on (20:17 - 20:23)
that level and in that block are all (20:20 - 20:25)
hotel rooms that they essentially they (20:23 - 20:26)
take the bed out of they empty it out (20:25 - 20:29)
and they they leave you pretty much (20:26 - 20:32)
nothing I guess for you to fill with (20:29 - 20:34)
your tables and your products and stuff (20:32 - 20:37)
like that and you for how small it was (20:34 - 20:39)
you did a really good job of making it (20:37 - 20:41)
spacious yeah and this year we actually (20:39 - 20:44)
had we had poking tournament setup we (20:41 - 20:48)
had pokemon stadium 2 pokemon snap the (20:44 - 20:51)
pokemon pinball machine that uh myself (20:48 - 20:55)
an errand built and then our merch table (20:51 - 20:57)
lismore so what we fit in the other (20:55 - 20:59)
rooms minus pokin I mean substitute like (20:57 - 21:02)
Pokemon Stadium one or bar pokemon (20:59 - 21:04)
puzzle league or you know some other (21:02 - 21:07)
games and you made the call of no chairs (21:04 - 21:10)
which i think was a good call because (21:07 - 21:12)
that would have made the room even more (21:10 - 21:14)
smaller but I think it also benefited in (21:12 - 21:17)
like hey like play some pokemon stadium (21:14 - 21:19)
2 but like don't sit here for eight (21:17 - 21:22)
hours right especially like people have (21:19 - 21:23)
a tendency to if they see that their (21:22 - 21:26)
chairs they think well I'll just sit (21:23 - 21:29)
here and take a rest and it's it's less (21:26 - 21:31)
about I mean not saying that people (21:29 - 21:33)
would just come in and just just because (21:31 - 21:36)
you have chairs but they're more (21:33 - 21:37)
inclined to stick around I think if you (21:36 - 21:40)
do because it's some place that they can (21:37 - 21:42)
rest from walking around all day yeah (21:40 - 21:44)
and we've we've had past years (21:42 - 21:48)
downstairs where people have spent more (21:44 - 21:51)
than four to five hours in the room yeah (21:48 - 21:55)
at a time and it blows my mind whoa (21:51 - 21:57)
first let me back up it's flattering (21:55 - 22:00)
that they find my room to fit their (21:57 - 22:04)
needs I get it it's awesome cool at the (22:00 - 22:08)
same time you just paid you know forty (22:04 - 22:10)
to sixty dollars for the weekend there's (22:08 - 22:13)
more than enough to see here why are you (22:10 - 22:16)
dedicating so much time to you know cuz (22:13 - 22:18)
you had chairs men I had chairs but you (22:16 - 22:20)
know I'm not (22:18 - 22:22)
on Stadium 2 is not that rare of a game (22:20 - 22:25)
it blew my mind that even though even (22:22 - 22:27)
after we had that conversation about (22:25 - 22:29)
chairs and wound up not putting chairs (22:27 - 22:31)
in the room there were people who would (22:29 - 22:33)
still come in and just sit on the floor (22:31 - 22:37)
yeah like it did I at the end of the day (22:33 - 22:39)
I guess maybe it didn't matter if there (22:37 - 22:41)
were chairs sir we'll sit wherever they (22:39 - 22:47)
want so how'd you will come back to the (22:41 - 22:48)
Pokemon podcast room but how did you (22:47 - 22:50)
feel overall about the con you probably (22:48 - 22:51)
walked around more than i did just (22:50 - 22:54)
because i had to say stationed at the (22:51 - 22:56)
booth boat how'd you feel it how'd you (22:54 - 22:59)
feel the con was i liked it it's good (22:56 - 23:00)
it's it i mean i've been going to for a (22:59 - 23:04)
long time and you know i always enjoy it (23:00 - 23:07)
because it's it's the same experience (23:04 - 23:10)
and you kind of know what to expect you (23:07 - 23:12)
know to expect there's going to be some (23:10 - 23:14)
really cool old stuff there that you've (23:12 - 23:18)
either never seen in person or you you (23:14 - 23:21)
know have never hey you're you haven't (23:18 - 23:23)
played in a long time or something like (23:21 - 23:24)
that something from your childhood that (23:23 - 23:27)
you haven't seen in forever and the (23:24 - 23:29)
vendor hall i think last year the year (23:27 - 23:30)
before was the first time that they (23:29 - 23:33)
started doing a tent outside for the (23:30 - 23:35)
vendor hall instead of inside i think (23:33 - 23:38)
this is the third year they're in it (23:35 - 23:41)
yeah cuz the first this is the first (23:38 - 23:42)
year where the tent was like the biggest (23:41 - 23:46)
that's ever been yeah but i remember the (23:42 - 23:48)
last they're both years they had the (23:46 - 23:52)
tent prior was rainy and flooded yep and (23:48 - 23:56)
the tents nice it you know it it is a (23:52 - 23:59)
good place for people to walk around and (23:56 - 24:01)
see the vendors and stuff like that but (23:59 - 24:04)
all in all it's generally always the (24:01 - 24:06)
same experience with some new little (24:04 - 24:09)
surprises that you find along the way so (24:06 - 24:12)
it's nice being able to you know when (24:09 - 24:14)
you're anticipating mgc and you're (24:12 - 24:16)
getting ready for it and you're looking (24:14 - 24:18)
forward to it you know exactly what it's (24:16 - 24:21)
going to be and it's comforting going to (24:18 - 24:23)
it and it's exactly what you were (24:21 - 24:27)
anticipating that being said I (24:23 - 24:30)
a couple times this weekend and even to (24:27 - 24:31)
people who other friends of mine who (24:30 - 24:33)
were there that have been going for a (24:31 - 24:36)
long time as well that midwest gaming (24:33 - 24:39)
classic i think is drastically outgrown (24:36 - 24:44)
that facility that that location it's (24:39 - 24:46)
the fact that they have to keep (24:44 - 24:48)
increasing the size of the tent that (24:46 - 24:51)
they have outsize outside is a clear (24:48 - 24:54)
indicator that it's too big for the (24:51 - 24:58)
Brookfield hotel yeah I think it's just (24:54 - 25:02)
it needs to be somewhere where people (24:58 - 25:04)
can have access to everything pretty (25:02 - 25:06)
pretty quickly because everything's (25:04 - 25:08)
really really spread out in a really (25:06 - 25:11)
awkward way with how big it's grown (25:08 - 25:13)
there's you know a lot of the stuff that (25:11 - 25:17)
you see is really cool as always you (25:13 - 25:19)
know I i saw i don't know if you saw (25:17 - 25:21)
this but when i was walking around the (25:19 - 25:24)
head in a glass case the nintendo (25:21 - 25:28)
playstation but like one remaining a (25:24 - 25:30)
copy of it the actual console they had (25:28 - 25:32)
it in like a glass case and that was (25:30 - 25:34)
really cool to see because i've never (25:32 - 25:37)
seen that before um and i picked up a (25:34 - 25:39)
couple things couple like you know it (25:37 - 25:41)
was very cool it's obviously you can't (25:39 - 25:44)
play it but you know was one of those (25:41 - 25:47)
gems you were hinting at earlier the guy (25:44 - 25:51)
selling v pokemon roms uh i mean that's (25:47 - 25:53)
something that I hadn't seen yet I don't (25:51 - 25:57)
think I've seen some you know rom hacks (25:53 - 26:00)
before but I think the last few years up (25:57 - 26:02)
until this year I hadn't really been (26:00 - 26:06)
paying attention to like grey area as (26:02 - 26:09)
far as legality goes on like games that (26:06 - 26:11)
are available in the vendor hall but (26:09 - 26:13)
this one caught my eye mostly just (26:11 - 26:15)
because they had the twitch plays (26:13 - 26:20)
pokemon anniversary cartridge which was (26:15 - 26:21)
pretty cool like the physical cartridge (26:20 - 26:24)
and I wound up picking that up but they (26:21 - 26:26)
had a lot of them they had a ton of them (26:24 - 26:29)
which were a lot of fam games that has (26:26 - 26:32)
fan-made games that I've seen before but (26:29 - 26:35)
all on you know really generic Gameboy (26:32 - 26:36)
cartridges or Game Boy Advance (26:35 - 26:40)
cartridges there's absolutely no way (26:36 - 26:41)
that there (26:40 - 26:45)
is any legal merit to any of that that (26:41 - 26:48)
can't be legal right right then if I (26:45 - 26:51)
know that the switch plays pokemon (26:48 - 26:53)
cartridge was available for a while (26:51 - 26:55)
now-like it was you know they did it for (26:53 - 26:56)
the first anniversary the one year (26:55 - 26:59)
anniversary and it was sold online and (26:56 - 27:03)
I'm sure that Nintendo saw that and (26:59 - 27:08)
didn't do anything about it so I mean (27:03 - 27:10)
that one in specific I guess maybe I (27:08 - 27:12)
don't know why that would be much of a (27:10 - 27:13)
difference though you know there was (27:12 - 27:19)
probably 20 to 30 easily different types (27:13 - 27:22)
of ROM whether it was like Pokemon sky (27:19 - 27:24)
dark version or Pokemon brown or pokemon (27:22 - 27:29)
sweet dreams or Pokemon Rayquaza emerald (27:24 - 27:33)
version pokémon glazed and and like he (27:29 - 27:35)
said like some of those you saw before (27:33 - 27:41)
and I like I cannot imagine that this (27:35 - 27:45)
guy went and grabbed these roms like (27:41 - 27:48)
whoever made Pokemon Brown and was like (27:45 - 27:50)
I grabbed this rom I put it into a game (27:48 - 27:52)
board cartridge I print out a sticker I (27:50 - 27:56)
stick the sticker on I make up a box to (27:52 - 28:00)
put it in and I sell it for forty (27:56 - 28:02)
dollars because I think every single (28:00 - 28:05)
romhack was forty dollars would put (28:02 - 28:07)
money on it that the person who made (28:05 - 28:10)
those roms they are not seeing a penny (28:07 - 28:14)
right absolutely it can't be it can't be (28:10 - 28:17)
like the only reason that I think the (28:14 - 28:18)
twitch plays pokemon version was a (28:17 - 28:20)
different scenarios because they Vere (28:18 - 28:23)
they had very specific packaging for the (28:20 - 28:26)
one that was sold in conjunction with (28:23 - 28:28)
the actual twitch plays pokemon (28:26 - 28:30)
anniversary like a sleeve that had (28:28 - 28:33)
embossed printing and you know it's (28:30 - 28:35)
something that none of the other ones (28:33 - 28:37)
had really yeah and even then it was (28:35 - 28:40)
marked up for sure from what it was sold (28:37 - 28:43)
online for so my my guess at least from (28:40 - 28:45)
being there with that the guy bought (28:43 - 28:47)
some on Etsy or wherever it was that (28:45 - 28:50)
they sold them and then just sold them (28:47 - 28:52)
it along with his other roms and marked (28:50 - 28:54)
it up ten dollars or whatever it is that (28:52 - 28:56)
he marked it up as far as the legality (28:54 - 28:58)
goes it's it's amazing to me that (28:56 - 29:02)
nintendo hasnt seen hasn't done anything (28:58 - 29:05)
i mean maybe this this guy is an anomaly (29:02 - 29:08)
but I I have to think that if he's doing (29:05 - 29:12)
it multiple people at multiple different (29:08 - 29:15)
retro game conventions all over the (29:12 - 29:18)
states are probably also doing it and (29:15 - 29:20)
the fact that Nintendo is a company that (29:18 - 29:22)
will go on to you (29:20 - 29:24)
or whatever and strike people copyright (29:22 - 29:26)
strike people for reviewing their games (29:24 - 29:29)
or whatever it is and there's nothing (29:26 - 29:31)
that's been done about this and this guy (29:29 - 29:32)
could just be there out in the open (29:31 - 29:35)
selling stuff that was clearly (29:32 - 29:39)
infringing on on an IP right what's kind (29:35 - 29:41)
of mind-blowing yeah and no and I'm not (29:39 - 29:44)
saying like whoever made Pokemon Brown (29:41 - 29:46)
obviously this guy grabbed it put it on (29:44 - 29:48)
the cartridge now signing for four (29:46 - 29:49)
dollars person who made Pokemon Brown (29:48 - 29:53)
isn't seeing a penny that may be but I (29:49 - 29:55)
highly doubt it because there were so (29:53 - 29:57)
many different rom versions all right (29:55 - 30:00)
this goes back to there was you know 30 (29:57 - 30:02)
different rom versions like the guy (30:00 - 30:04)
selling it I guarantee you the guy (30:02 - 30:06)
selling it didn't make these round (30:04 - 30:08)
versions like he grabbed them from (30:06 - 30:10)
somewhere dumped them started selling (30:08 - 30:13)
them and totally absolutely to the (30:10 - 30:16)
legality issue there's there's no way (30:13 - 30:18)
that like like that would be like me (30:16 - 30:22)
taking banjo kazooie and like switching (30:18 - 30:26)
out Kazooie to be of pijat and then (30:22 - 30:28)
switching out banjo to be a bear taking (30:26 - 30:30)
when like forty dollars here's your (30:28 - 30:34)
Pokemon Kazooie game come and get it hot (30:30 - 30:37)
off the presses you just can't do that (30:34 - 30:40)
it's almost like I guess I what I would (30:37 - 30:42)
almost equate it to is if someone made (30:40 - 30:46)
cut an album of cover songs or something (30:42 - 30:48)
and they released it for free because (30:46 - 30:50)
they didn't want to infringe on the (30:48 - 30:53)
original artists work they released it (30:50 - 30:56)
for free online and weren't making any (30:53 - 30:57)
money from it and then somebody who (30:56 - 30:59)
downloaded it then burned it to a bunch (30:57 - 31:01)
of CDs and took it somewhere and started (30:59 - 31:04)
selling it like that (31:01 - 31:07)
that's kind of the you can have rom (31:04 - 31:11)
hacks and and distribute them online for (31:07 - 31:13)
free because you know it's it's it's fan (31:11 - 31:16)
it's essentially fan art where to some (31:13 - 31:18)
degree it's it's I feel like it falls (31:16 - 31:21)
under the same the same category it's (31:18 - 31:23)
you know it's it's a piece of fan work (31:21 - 31:27)
and you're not making any money from it (31:23 - 31:30)
from it it's it's not anything that (31:27 - 31:35)
you're taking money from Nintendo for so (31:30 - 31:38)
for this guy to then take that and copy (31:35 - 31:41)
it all having done pretty much no work (31:38 - 31:45)
and then sell it is pretty shady yes yes (31:41 - 31:48)
and it it almost blows my mind even more (31:45 - 31:53)
that that when yours I I don't know I (31:48 - 31:55)
don't know the extent of how to sign up (31:53 - 31:57)
for a vendor booths because the people (31:55 - 32:00)
the vendors do a different process than (31:57 - 32:04)
the people doing rooms and so when when (32:00 - 32:07)
you sign up to be a vendor is what do (32:04 - 32:09)
you say you're selling I'm just selling (32:07 - 32:10)
hash pokemon games here for 40 hours (32:09 - 32:13)
apiece I know it's not legal but you (32:10 - 32:14)
know I'll be right over the year that (32:13 - 32:18)
cool awesome cool well and they were (32:14 - 32:21)
selling a bunch of other stuff so I (32:18 - 32:24)
think they probably didn't they probably (32:21 - 32:26)
weren't completely clear and what they (32:24 - 32:27)
were everything they were going to be (32:26 - 32:30)
selling like they had a section of (32:27 - 32:33)
plushies and you know all kinds of stuff (32:30 - 32:35)
that towards the end of the day one of (32:33 - 32:36)
the things that I noticed is towards the (32:35 - 32:37)
end of the day and towards the beginning (32:36 - 32:40)
of the day almost all of the rom hack (32:37 - 32:43)
stuff was either covered up or it wasn't (32:40 - 32:46)
out yet and when we were going around (32:43 - 32:47)
the vendor halls and everything was (32:46 - 32:50)
packed up way before everybody else is (32:47 - 32:52)
packed up that guy had all of the rom (32:50 - 32:55)
hacks packed up and that kind of made me (32:52 - 32:59)
feel like he knew he wasn't supposed to (32:55 - 33:00)
probably wasn't supposed to be selling (32:59 - 33:05)
the stuff there but again (33:00 - 33:08)
I'm sure some of the people mgc that run (33:05 - 33:11)
mgc probably didn't really know or care (33:08 - 33:14)
either you know right cuz I I've been to (33:11 - 33:16)
c2e2 and like I've walked up and down (33:14 - 33:19)
the aisles and you see DHS's that are (33:16 - 33:23)
clearly knockoff VHS is yeah all in a (33:19 - 33:25)
row and it's it's it's the same thing (33:23 - 33:28)
and it's like how like how are you (33:25 - 33:30)
selling knockoff VHS is it such a big (33:28 - 33:35)
event but like who who is who's going to (33:30 - 33:39)
say something I guess with with midwest (33:35 - 33:42)
gaming classic I mean like at going like (33:39 - 33:45)
who cares about a VHS it's nine I think (33:42 - 33:47)
they sell them for like nine or ten (33:45 - 33:49)
dollars or something and whoever's (33:47 - 33:50)
buying them is absolutely insane because (33:49 - 33:53)
it's a VHS but I don't know forty (33:50 - 33:56)
dollars for a romhack that you can play (33:53 - 33:58)
online for free just so you can play it (33:56 - 33:59)
in your Game Boy in your game boy (33:58 - 34:02)
advance and like know in the back of (33:59 - 34:04)
your head that like the guy selling it (34:02 - 34:07)
is not the guy who created it right just (34:04 - 34:10)
like it like it x me more than losing at (34:07 - 34:14)
clash Royale yeah it's it's pretty shady (34:10 - 34:17)
it really is like you said it's it's (34:14 - 34:19)
it's like fan art but when like I'm (34:17 - 34:21)
buying a Pokemon print from an artist (34:19 - 34:23)
it's very cool to be like oh you did (34:21 - 34:25)
this like you did this art you put the (34:23 - 34:29)
time into it like yeah you don't own the (34:25 - 34:31)
copyright to Bulbasaur and yeah you're (34:29 - 34:33)
probably only selling them at these (34:31 - 34:35)
shows and you're probably gonna make you (34:33 - 34:37)
know a couple bucks but like to me it's (34:35 - 34:40)
like I'm not buying it because it's not (34:37 - 34:42)
buying it because I liked it and because (34:40 - 34:44)
it's something I like like pokemon but (34:42 - 34:47)
like a more of like here's the money for (34:44 - 34:49)
your time in your art not so much like (34:47 - 34:52)
here's some money for ripping off (34:49 - 34:54)
somebody and that's that's a really good (34:52 - 34:57)
analogy for it it's like if you were (34:54 - 34:59)
running an art booth and you went online (34:57 - 35:02)
and googled pokemon fan art and then (34:59 - 35:04)
printed out a bunch of stuff and sold (35:02 - 35:06)
Prince like that's that's pretty much (35:04 - 35:09)
what this guys doing yeah yeah that was (35:06 - 35:11)
probably the the most shocking thing (35:09 - 35:14)
amid waseem in classic however let me (35:11 - 35:16)
say there are that is that's one (35:14 - 35:18)
specific (35:16 - 35:20)
incense amongst everything else that's (35:18 - 35:22)
going on there and in the vendor hall (35:20 - 35:24)
and stuff like that I don't want that to (35:22 - 35:25)
overshadow the fact that there are a lot (35:24 - 35:27)
of really really awesome vendors there (35:25 - 35:32)
too and a lot of really amazing you know (35:27 - 35:34)
independent projects that people have (35:32 - 35:37)
booths in the vendor hall to to sell and (35:34 - 35:40)
showcase their own work to like one of (35:37 - 35:43)
the things that I saw that was a really (35:40 - 35:48)
awesome and be really um kind of a (35:43 - 35:51)
perfect fit for this convention was I (35:48 - 35:56)
think the comp the the company is called (35:51 - 36:03)
retro tainment or maybe cash in culture (35:56 - 36:04)
but they had a game called haunted (36:03 - 36:09)
Halloween 85 and it's it was a retro (36:04 - 36:12)
like an 8-bit Nintendo retro game that (36:09 - 36:16)
they made uh and they released it only (36:12 - 36:20)
on NES cartridges that they that they (36:16 - 36:22)
bought and they published it as a (36:20 - 36:25)
Nintendo game as an NES game to like (36:22 - 36:28)
this year and I thought that was really (36:25 - 36:29)
cool and it was also a really really (36:28 - 36:31)
good fit for that convention because not (36:29 - 36:32)
only is it a new game but it also has (36:31 - 36:35)
all the culture that you find at Midwest (36:32 - 36:37)
gaming classica that people go to (36:35 - 36:40)
midwest gaming classic for and they had (36:37 - 36:41)
a really cool booth in the vendor hall (36:40 - 36:45)
they're really really nice guys and you (36:41 - 36:49)
know it's just it's unfortunate that you (36:45 - 36:52)
then go to other portions of the vendor (36:49 - 36:55)
hall and you see some of the shadier (36:52 - 36:58)
things happening yeah unfortunately too (36:55 - 37:00)
i mean i'm guessing the guy that was (36:58 - 37:01)
selling the rom hacks and stuff probably (37:00 - 37:02)
walked away with way more money than (37:01 - 37:05)
those guys did but you know can't win (37:02 - 37:08)
them all can't win them all that being (37:05 - 37:10)
said though there is a lot of really (37:08 - 37:11)
awesome stuff going on in the vendor (37:10 - 37:13)
hall aside from the shady stuff that's (37:11 - 37:17)
going on too yeah it's it's a it's an (37:13 - 37:18)
interesting show and it's a like you (37:17 - 37:20)
said earlier it's it's gotten way bigger (37:18 - 37:24)
i think the space it I it's been said (37:20 - 37:26)
probably for three years straight and (37:24 - 37:28)
I'd like the space is too small for the (37:26 - 37:30)
amount of people that it draws in (37:28 - 37:34)
having us having a new room was it was (37:30 - 37:37)
refreshing but it was also frustrating (37:34 - 37:42)
he was like we know how busy this (37:37 - 37:44)
convention is and now we're with a (37:42 - 37:46)
smaller room like it's great that we're (37:44 - 37:47)
in a different room to like you know (37:46 - 37:50)
just to mix things up and to try (37:47 - 37:52)
something different but this room is too (37:50 - 37:57)
tiny and I don't know I think i was i (37:52 - 38:02)
was telling irene this and and my friend (37:57 - 38:04)
k and i gotta i gotta give a shout out (38:02 - 38:07)
to k because k comes all the way from (38:04 - 38:09)
Michigan he's been coming since i (38:07 - 38:11)
started going the midwest game classic (38:09 - 38:14)
the 66 year he hasn't missed it the last (38:11 - 38:17)
two years he's he's helped me set up to (38:14 - 38:20)
help me tear down he brings an extra TV (38:17 - 38:22)
in case I needs it I need it he brings (38:20 - 38:26)
extra Pokemon games and nintendo 64 like (38:22 - 38:28)
he brought his wii u this year so we (38:26 - 38:30)
could hook up poke in and have liked to (38:28 - 38:32)
poke ins connected through ethernet (38:30 - 38:35)
which probably on our next episode i'll (38:32 - 38:38)
explain what a headache that was but big (38:35 - 38:41)
big shout-out to k like what a great (38:38 - 38:43)
dude and i know you listen to podcast (38:41 - 38:46)
but like just got to give him a shout (38:43 - 38:48)
out what I was what I was saying to them (38:46 - 38:51)
was like it's so weird (38:48 - 38:51)
and they could just be because the know (38:52 - 38:56)
the kvetching has gotten so big or like (38:54 - 38:58)
or you know the convention is very like (38:56 - 39:01)
you know what to expect like these guys (38:58 - 39:02)
are always here those guys are always (39:01 - 39:04)
there like these vendors always return (39:02 - 39:07)
pokémon podcast is always downstairs in (39:04 - 39:10)
the basement but like you know what to (39:07 - 39:12)
expect so like the first two or three (39:10 - 39:16)
years I felt like our room was so hot (39:12 - 39:18)
cast focused where people would come in (39:16 - 39:20)
they would ask about the podcast they (39:18 - 39:22)
would grab a business card we would sell (39:20 - 39:24)
some t-shirts or some buttons or some (39:22 - 39:27)
stickers related to the podcast some (39:24 - 39:28)
people would stay for pokemon stadium (39:27 - 39:30)
you know some people would do some (39:28 - 39:32)
pokemon snap like there was a real good (39:30 - 39:35)
ebb and flow in the room this year it (39:32 - 39:37)
was almost like none of that I don't (39:35 - 39:41)
know many people that came in to like (39:37 - 39:43)
specifically asked about the podcast (39:41 - 39:44)
like when you're sitting in the room and (39:43 - 39:46)
you see people walk by you always hear (39:44 - 39:48)
like Midwest gaming Pokemon podcast oh (39:46 - 39:51)
that's where the pokemon stuff is oh and (39:48 - 39:52)
they would either come in or they would (39:51 - 39:56)
keep walking and obviously that's normal (39:52 - 39:57)
like not in a Pokemon you're not going (39:56 - 40:00)
to come in maybe I'm putting too much (39:57 - 40:03)
emphasis on playing old pokemon games or (40:00 - 40:06)
playing pokin where I don't know like I (40:03 - 40:10)
I'm there for the podcast at the end of (40:06 - 40:14)
the day right and people playing pokin (40:10 - 40:16)
is really cool but like they're not (40:14 - 40:18)
walking out with a business card and I i (40:16 - 40:20)
I'm not telling people to come in and (40:18 - 40:22)
like buy a shirt by these two dollars (40:20 - 40:23)
shirts because I'm trying to get rid of (40:22 - 40:25)
them cuz they're the pun is no longer (40:23 - 40:30)
funny um but there's something that kind (40:25 - 40:34)
of like deep down bothers me that like (40:30 - 40:37)
these are my TV's these are my we use (40:34 - 40:39)
this is my game this is my controller (40:37 - 40:42)
like everything is mine and people come (40:39 - 40:44)
in and they play it and they leave and (40:42 - 40:46)
cool they have a smile on my face but (40:44 - 40:48)
like my enjoyment would have been like (40:46 - 40:51)
oh you run a podcast can I get a (40:48 - 40:54)
business card and it's like maybe if I (40:51 - 40:57)
take all that away and just have the (40:54 - 40:59)
room and we talked about this Mike and I (40:57 - 41:01)
talked about this of like do I even want (40:59 - 41:03)
to do this next year like (41:01 - 41:06)
due to bring all my stuff is one thing (41:03 - 41:08)
to like keep people entertained and to (41:06 - 41:11)
like be there but like to dedicate my (41:08 - 41:14)
time is also probably more valuable than (41:11 - 41:18)
any of that right like to spend the (41:14 - 41:21)
entire day friday setting up to spend (41:18 - 41:23)
the entire day saturday like i have to (41:21 - 41:25)
be there by nine i have to stay there (41:23 - 41:27)
till eight I have friends that coming (41:25 - 41:29)
out of town for this and like yeah we (41:27 - 41:31)
can get dinner we can maybe do one or (41:29 - 41:33)
two things but then I got to go to bed (41:31 - 41:34)
because I gotta do it all again on (41:33 - 41:36)
Sunday and then said well Sunday it ends (41:34 - 41:37)
at five we can do more and it's like (41:36 - 41:39)
well no I got a teardown and I'm (41:37 - 41:41)
completely exhausted after that and it's (41:39 - 41:44)
like on monday i just want to sleep in (41:41 - 41:46)
because i have zero sleep and the week (41:44 - 41:48)
up to that is just me planning making (41:46 - 41:51)
sure i have like change and all the (41:48 - 41:54)
cables and stupid stuff that I probably (41:51 - 41:55)
would have forgotten even if I made a (41:54 - 41:59)
huge list 50 hours more than 72 hours of (41:55 - 42:02)
my week to go into watching somebody (41:59 - 42:04)
play pokin and walking out is that worth (42:02 - 42:07)
my time yeah and when we talked about it (42:04 - 42:09)
that's kind of what i would say i mean i (42:07 - 42:13)
have a little bit of a different opinion (42:09 - 42:16)
of it because i mean i think i've (42:13 - 42:19)
brought it up when i was on the show way (42:16 - 42:23)
back but that's mgc is how I found you (42:19 - 42:25)
like that's how i found the podcast (42:23 - 42:28)
that's how i started listening what was (42:25 - 42:31)
it 33 years you're however long ago now (42:28 - 42:33)
like that was the first time that I saw (42:31 - 42:37)
you in the Midwest gaming classic and I (42:33 - 42:40)
was so amazed that somebody had a room (42:37 - 42:42)
entirely dedicated to Pokemon and I (42:40 - 42:43)
grabbed that little card that's how I (42:42 - 42:45)
started listening to the podcast so I (42:43 - 42:49)
can see that some people can find it (42:45 - 42:51)
confide in the podcast that way and (42:49 - 42:53)
that's that's great that there are some (42:51 - 42:56)
people that are maybe finding it that (42:53 - 42:59)
didn't know that it existed before like (42:56 - 43:01)
I did but for the most part it seems (42:59 - 43:04)
like the last couple years mgc has (43:01 - 43:06)
really just become it's mostly just (43:04 - 43:10)
become a vendor hall and kind of like a (43:06 - 43:13)
museum showcase where people sometimes (43:10 - 43:16)
go to show off their product or you know (43:13 - 43:17)
their project or (43:16 - 43:19)
whatever it is that they they're coming (43:17 - 43:21)
to showcase like you do with the Pokemon (43:19 - 43:25)
podcast and that fighting game those (43:21 - 43:27)
guys have been there multiple years now (43:25 - 43:29)
they do it's kind of like old-school (43:27 - 43:31)
Mortal Kombat games where it's like (43:29 - 43:33)
live-action animation those guys have (43:31 - 43:36)
been there so many years and I have to (43:33 - 43:38)
wonder how many people even talk to them (43:36 - 43:40)
about their project anymore and how many (43:38 - 43:42)
people just come in just to play it (43:40 - 43:45)
those all of those rooms in the block (43:42 - 43:47)
that you were in this year it's it's (43:45 - 43:49)
almost like anybody that's they're (43:47 - 43:51)
checking anything out it's just a museum (43:49 - 43:53)
to them they come in they look around (43:51 - 43:54)
they play it they don't talk to the (43:53 - 43:56)
person who's running the room and then (43:54 - 43:57)
they leave and they move on to the next (43:56 - 44:02)
room and it's it's you know I guess it's (43:57 - 44:04)
it's almost like that culture just (44:02 - 44:07)
doesn't seem to really fit the the the (44:04 - 44:12)
maker culture I guess anymore so yeah it (44:07 - 44:15)
it's weird like it it pains me to be (44:12 - 44:17)
like I don't want to do mgc because I (44:15 - 44:20)
feel like mgc is like one of like the (44:17 - 44:23)
things that Pokemon podcast does every (44:20 - 44:25)
year I speak at c2e2 every year and I (44:23 - 44:29)
absolutely love that and I go to mgc and (44:25 - 44:31)
I run a room where people come in and (44:29 - 44:33)
they're like this is really cool and (44:31 - 44:35)
hopefully they leave with knowing that i (44:33 - 44:38)
run a podcast or like i do i tried to do (44:35 - 44:41)
cool things and i didn't feel that at (44:38 - 44:43)
all this year and that's not to say like (44:41 - 44:45)
i had people come in that has come in (44:43 - 44:47)
from year to year and they're like love (44:45 - 44:50)
the show this episode was really funny (44:47 - 44:52)
or i liked when you told that wrestling (44:50 - 44:55)
story or like there were a handful of (44:52 - 44:57)
people that did that like that and that (44:55 - 44:59)
means the world to me like it feels so (44:57 - 45:02)
great to like meet somebody in person (44:59 - 45:05)
that goes I listen to your show and I (45:02 - 45:08)
enjoy it and it's like wow awesome cool (45:05 - 45:10)
like this is why I'm here for the (45:08 - 45:13)
weekend but that was so far and few (45:10 - 45:15)
between compared to last year's it was (45:13 - 45:19)
just right very a bit is very heavy and (45:15 - 45:23)
really I think you know this it kind of (45:19 - 45:26)
fuels my opinion that it needs to move (45:23 - 45:29)
it needs to be somewhere that feels more (45:26 - 45:31)
like a convent (45:29 - 45:34)
and les like les like a showcase because (45:31 - 45:38)
that's really all it is now even even (45:34 - 45:40)
when they have people you know doing (45:38 - 45:42)
talks and stuff like that it's in a bar (45:40 - 45:45)
there it's at the bar in a restaurant in (45:42 - 45:48)
the in the inside the hotel restaurant (45:45 - 45:52)
that's open to the entire hallway and so (45:48 - 45:53)
many people are walking through that (45:52 - 45:55)
nobody is paying attention to the talks (45:53 - 45:58)
and the few people that are paying (45:55 - 46:00)
attention to the talks probably can't (45:58 - 46:02)
hear what they're saying very well it's (46:00 - 46:04)
probably not a really good environment (46:02 - 46:09)
for having a talk or you know and I (46:04 - 46:11)
think if it moved if it went somewhere (46:09 - 46:15)
else and it was it was kind of refreshed (46:11 - 46:18)
that would help it a lot unfortunately I (46:15 - 46:20)
don't think that that's really after 15 (46:18 - 46:22)
years of this I don't think that that's (46:20 - 46:25)
really gonna happen you know it's it's (46:22 - 46:27)
it feels like it's always going to be (46:25 - 46:31)
walking into a museum an interactive (46:27 - 46:34)
museum buying stuff that is in some (46:31 - 46:39)
cases kind of questionable and just (46:34 - 46:42)
walking through a hotel hallway if they (46:39 - 46:44)
could change that I could see that being (46:42 - 46:46)
really beneficial to people like (46:44 - 46:48)
yourself or other makers want to show (46:46 - 46:51)
off their products or their projects but (46:48 - 46:53)
until there's some sort of change in the (46:51 - 46:57)
format it's just not conducive to (46:53 - 46:59)
getting people interested I guess (46:57 - 47:00)
because they're not there to be (46:59 - 47:03)
interested in something they're there to (47:00 - 47:07)
play the same you know play old pinball (47:03 - 47:08)
stuff that they haven't seen in a long (47:07 - 47:11)
time or play old uh you know super (47:08 - 47:14)
nintendo games that they haven't seen in (47:11 - 47:16)
a really long time or in a lot of cases (47:14 - 47:19)
it's parents who are not really there to (47:16 - 47:23)
you know see anything new their whole (47:19 - 47:25)
reason for being there is that they're (47:23 - 47:26)
bringing their kids to show them the (47:25 - 47:28)
games that they played when they were a (47:26 - 47:31)
kid you know and they're not there to be (47:28 - 47:35)
interested in new projects or you know (47:31 - 47:39)
stuff like that I guess it to some (47:35 - 47:41)
degree some of it is not going to change (47:39 - 47:44)
and that's probably okay for a lot for a (47:41 - 47:45)
lot of the people there (47:44 - 47:47)
you know a lot of the consumers that are (47:45 - 47:49)
there but the people that are actually (47:47 - 47:51)
running it repeated the people that are (47:49 - 47:53)
actively involved in it like yourself (47:51 - 47:56)
and like the the haunted Halloween guys (47:53 - 47:59)
and stuff like that you know it's not (47:56 - 48:03)
really conducive to them to for what (47:59 - 48:05)
their you know their reason for being (48:03 - 48:08)
there is yeah I already have like a (48:05 - 48:09)
million things running through my head (48:08 - 48:11)
of like next year or like what am I (48:09 - 48:13)
going to do next here am I going to go (48:11 - 48:16)
back next year and it's like I feel like (48:13 - 48:18)
I can't get my old room back feel like (48:16 - 48:21)
that's off the table because it's like (48:18 - 48:23)
why would the people that are now in it (48:21 - 48:26)
give it up right I think about the (48:23 - 48:28)
smaller room and I think about what went (48:26 - 48:29)
wrong and what we're right in the past (48:28 - 48:32)
and and there's a got like a couple (48:29 - 48:34)
things that like I think matter like (48:32 - 48:37)
obviously advertising my podcast and (48:34 - 48:39)
like making sure that people know that (48:37 - 48:41)
like you said it when you were outside (48:39 - 48:43)
the door this is the Pokemon podcast (48:41 - 48:44)
room and I think the podcast gets (48:43 - 48:48)
forgotten when he walk-in yeah but like (48:44 - 48:50)
I do have the the arcade machine that i (48:48 - 48:52)
built the pinball machine mm-hmm and i (48:50 - 48:56)
think that is a showpiece that sticks (48:52 - 48:57)
out at any convention i would take it (48:56 - 49:01)
too right I think maybe mayor marrying (48:57 - 49:03)
the fact that like I've worked with a (49:01 - 49:06)
ton of artists before and I'm sure those (49:03 - 49:07)
artists would like to get their work out (49:06 - 49:09)
and I would be more than happy to be (49:07 - 49:12)
like let's build a wall inside this room (49:09 - 49:15)
of all your guys's art and let me sell (49:12 - 49:18)
it for you and like give back to the (49:15 - 49:20)
artists that have done stuff for me the (49:18 - 49:21)
past like I think that would be really (49:20 - 49:24)
cool mm-hmm because running pokemon (49:21 - 49:27)
stadium 2 every year is just not working (49:24 - 49:29)
and there were a lot of people that came (49:27 - 49:32)
in that we're excited about you know (49:29 - 49:36)
seeing the art that was there and the (49:32 - 49:38)
stickers and stuff like that you know (49:36 - 49:39)
there were a couple people who were (49:38 - 49:41)
specifically really excited about the (49:39 - 49:45)
splatoon pokemon mashup stickers and (49:41 - 49:47)
that was really cool to see and you (49:45 - 49:51)
still did have you know a good handful (49:47 - 49:54)
of people that came in and were either (49:51 - 49:56)
listeners or hadn't heard about it (49:54 - 49:58)
before and we're (49:56 - 49:59)
asking questions about it and stuff like (49:58 - 50:01)
that the two things that stick out in my (49:59 - 50:04)
mind were the dad with his son and (50:01 - 50:06)
daughter who came in and they were (50:04 - 50:09)
referencing old jokes from the podcast (50:06 - 50:11)
and you were like it's always surreal to (50:09 - 50:13)
me that people remember you know or when (50:11 - 50:16)
people are telling me jokes that come (50:13 - 50:19)
from the podcast in person and then the (50:16 - 50:22)
kid and his mom who came in and they had (50:19 - 50:25)
said that they you know listen to the (50:22 - 50:27)
podcast and stuff like that and that the (50:25 - 50:30)
one kid who specifically was asking uh (50:27 - 50:34)
for information on what was it shinier (50:30 - 50:36)
also I think oh yeah he's trying to (50:34 - 50:37)
figure out how to give shut your mouth (50:36 - 50:40)
shout out to that kid there's no easy (50:37 - 50:44)
answer for that so it's it's really cool (50:40 - 50:48)
this to see that from you know the did (50:44 - 50:51)
the volunteer side of of the Pokemon (50:48 - 50:54)
podcast room but you know when it's all (50:51 - 50:58)
said and done I think maybe the takeaway (50:54 - 51:00)
is that (50:58 - 51:03)
it's it it comes across more as like a (51:00 - 51:07)
you know a showcase I guess and that's (51:03 - 51:09)
just generally the the show I think I (51:07 - 51:11)
don't know that that's necessarily just (51:09 - 51:16)
on your part but just the culture of (51:11 - 51:20)
that show mmm yeah whereas you know four (51:16 - 51:22)
years ago it wasn't so much like that (51:20 - 51:25)
right well Wow to be honest I didn't (51:22 - 51:27)
think we'd be talking this long but (51:25 - 51:30)
Midwest in a classic but I don't want to (51:27 - 51:33)
say about OMG see you put Mike and I in (51:30 - 51:35)
a room we could talk forever it's true (51:33 - 51:37)
about anything we'll just never shut up (51:35 - 51:42)
I do want to touch on Michael is not (51:37 - 51:43)
here for this he was I think you're (51:42 - 51:46)
streaming forget what you're streaming (51:43 - 51:51)
um but uh last night at Tuesday night oh (51:46 - 51:55)
yeah yeah I was quantum break yeah (51:51 - 51:58)
quantum break I ran a Pokemon movie (51:55 - 52:00)
night I ran that on a service called (51:58 - 52:02)
rabbit have you heard of rabbit Micah I (52:00 - 52:07)
have we actually I have a discord server (52:02 - 52:10)
for viewers of the the the twitch (52:07 - 52:14)
channel my twitch channel and we have a (52:10 - 52:16)
specific section in the discord server (52:14 - 52:18)
called squared circle and we (52:16 - 52:20)
occasionally will watch wrestling on (52:18 - 52:23)
rabbit together yeah well Irene (52:20 - 52:25)
discovered rabbit about a month ago and (52:23 - 52:27)
she she uses it like every single night (52:25 - 52:29)
watching with other people so for our (52:27 - 52:31)
listeners that don't know how it works (52:29 - 52:37)
rabbit it's our a BB dot IT that's the (52:31 - 52:38)
website but they pronounce it rabbit (52:37 - 52:40)
because they reached out to me and we I (52:38 - 52:44)
talked with him a little bit but it you (52:40 - 52:46)
the host let's just say me would log (52:44 - 52:49)
into rabbit I would pick something to (52:46 - 52:51)
watch and it can auto connect to youtube (52:49 - 52:53)
I believe it can connect to netflix it (52:51 - 52:55)
connect to HBO GO I don't know how or (52:53 - 52:58)
why this is legal by the way speaking (52:55 - 53:00)
same question speaking of legality (52:58 - 53:02)
because I know when you like buy a DVD (53:00 - 53:04)
like you get the warning that says like (53:02 - 53:06)
only you can watch this DVD because you (53:04 - 53:09)
purchased the viewing license right of (53:06 - 53:13)
the DVD I'm not totally sure here we (53:09 - 53:14)
were talking a (53:13 - 53:17)
this uh when we were talking when (53:14 - 53:19)
WrestleMania was coming up because the (53:17 - 53:21)
people that I typically watch wrestling (53:19 - 53:22)
with were like oh we should watch (53:21 - 53:24)
wrestlemania together and rabbit and I (53:22 - 53:26)
was like well it doesn't say that you (53:24 - 53:28)
know the network is something that you (53:26 - 53:30)
can pull up through rabbit but when (53:28 - 53:32)
you're in rabbit you're essentially just (53:30 - 53:34)
using a browser so i don't know if you (53:32 - 53:36)
can just look at anything you should i (53:34 - 53:39)
would imagine be able to just go (53:36 - 53:43)
anywhere right yeah i think so cuz when (53:39 - 53:45)
you hit the hulu button it just bring (53:43 - 53:48)
some cuckoo oh right just brings up a (53:45 - 53:51)
browser yes i don't i don't know exactly (53:48 - 53:53)
how it works but anyways so if i'm the (53:51 - 53:58)
host I up a movie and then I get a link (53:53 - 54:00)
and then I send that link out and people (53:58 - 54:02)
click it and then they join the room and (54:00 - 54:03)
once they join your rabbit room there's (54:02 - 54:05)
a chat window on the side that everyone (54:03 - 54:07)
can start chatting in but you can also (54:05 - 54:09)
have the option to turn on everyone's (54:07 - 54:11)
voice or if the person wants their voice (54:09 - 54:14)
on and a video feed of them so if you're (54:11 - 54:15)
watching the movie you can have like (54:14 - 54:19)
like everyone's face video face like at (54:15 - 54:20)
the bottom and like everyone could be (54:19 - 54:22)
talking over the movie and stuff and I (54:20 - 54:24)
didn't want that for our first rabbit we (54:22 - 54:26)
just kept it to chat but on Tuesday we (54:24 - 54:31)
watch a Pokemon Arceus and the jewel of (54:26 - 54:32)
life it was the first time I saw that (54:31 - 54:37)
movie and there was a rabbit can hold 25 (54:32 - 54:40)
people i believe and we had to turn out (54:37 - 54:42)
of at about 17 people give or take you (54:40 - 54:44)
know a couple that came in and came out (54:42 - 54:47)
later you know how to leave early but it (54:44 - 54:51)
was really fun like it was I I probable (54:47 - 54:53)
probably do a whole episode later (54:51 - 54:56)
dedicated on the movie itself and I (54:53 - 54:58)
think you guys have enjoyed that in the (54:56 - 55:02)
past when I did a whole episode or (54:58 - 55:05)
what's the ricasso modesta needy axis (55:02 - 55:09)
and then I did one for the Victini movie (55:05 - 55:12)
i'll probably do one for Arceus in the (55:09 - 55:14)
jewel of life just (55:12 - 55:17)
today but yeah so people came in for (55:14 - 55:19)
rabbit we watched the movie we chatted (55:17 - 55:21)
there was a lot of jokes that came out (55:19 - 55:23)
of it it was it was really fun like it (55:21 - 55:26)
was the fat the movies 90 minutes and (55:23 - 55:30)
wouldn't boy to time just fly by it was (55:26 - 55:33)
really really awesome everyone in the (55:30 - 55:35)
chat was really cool everyone was really (55:33 - 55:37)
funny I was laughing the entire time the (55:35 - 55:38)
movie itself was actually really good (55:37 - 55:40)
one of the better pokemon movies i would (55:38 - 55:44)
i would argue with anyone that it was (55:40 - 55:46)
very good not a lot of ash but a lot of (55:44 - 55:49)
pokemon and that's that's all you can (55:46 - 55:52)
ask for in a Pokemon really that's the (55:49 - 55:54)
formula for the perfect Pokemon movie (55:52 - 55:59)
minimize ash bring up the total dials (55:54 - 56:00)
yeah it was it was a good movie it was a (55:59 - 56:04)
good time we will be probably doing (56:00 - 56:08)
another rabbit Pokemon movie night let (56:04 - 56:09)
me let me pull out my calendar real (56:08 - 56:11)
quick I just want to make sure that I (56:09 - 56:12)
get you guys the right date for the (56:11 - 56:15)
record I just pulled it up just to see (56:12 - 56:18)
and it is just a browser then you can go (56:15 - 56:20)
anywhere on it okay yeah I pull up (56:18 - 56:22)
whatever you are do not know how that is (56:20 - 56:27)
legal but okay um it's essentially (56:22 - 56:29)
screen sharing but on like a larger (56:27 - 56:33)
scale I guess yeah and not with your own (56:29 - 56:35)
computer so we will be doing another (56:33 - 56:40)
movie night on Friday april 22nd so (56:35 - 56:42)
about a week from when this podcast is (56:40 - 56:46)
published i will it will probably be (56:42 - 56:50)
around eight to nine p.m. central time i (56:46 - 56:52)
don't know the exact time but we'll do (56:50 - 56:54)
it on the friday night so more people (56:52 - 56:55)
can attend because obviously tuesday (56:54 - 56:58)
night was a little it's a weird night to (56:55 - 57:00)
stream a movie they'll do it on friday (56:58 - 57:03)
night it's limited to 24 people because (57:00 - 57:05)
obviously me being the host counts as (57:03 - 57:09)
one of the 25 the ten-dollar backers on (57:05 - 57:11)
slack the community backers will get (57:09 - 57:13)
first access i think there's 10 of them (57:11 - 57:16)
and then the rest of the slack will get (57:13 - 57:20)
access to the movie night first come (57:16 - 57:21)
first serve and then if that doesn't (57:20 - 57:24)
fill up we'll send the link to twitter (57:21 - 57:26)
and facebook so like (57:24 - 57:28)
said we had about it we had to turn out (57:26 - 57:30)
about 18 people last time very last (57:28 - 57:32)
minute but it was it was a lot of fun (57:30 - 57:35)
and everyone everyone in chat was like (57:32 - 57:37)
let's watch another movie right now and (57:35 - 57:39)
i was like no guys we there are only 18 (57:37 - 57:42)
pokemon movies we cannot burn through (57:39 - 57:45)
all of them in one night we got a space (57:42 - 57:49)
this out got minimize it more or less is (57:45 - 57:53)
more yeah so if you're just watching a (57:49 - 57:57)
Pokemon movie and participating in a (57:53 - 57:59)
hilarious jokes i think i'm funny (57:57 - 58:03)
sometimes April 22nd will be our next (57:59 - 58:06)
movie night and yeah stuff like this (58:03 - 58:08)
wouldn't really be possible without our (58:06 - 58:10)
patreon backers though I want to give (58:08 - 58:13)
them want to give them a shout out it's (58:10 - 58:15)
a really cool thing to rear you know (58:13 - 58:16)
it's it's something that I found (58:15 - 58:19)
recently too and it's it's it's a really (58:16 - 58:22)
cool way to connect with people and if (58:19 - 58:23)
there's any other Pokemon podcast trying (58:22 - 58:25)
to stream movies of a rabbit I just want (58:23 - 58:26)
to lay it out here that we did this (58:25 - 58:31)
first I will burn that fresh right (58:26 - 58:31)
probably watch all the movies with more (58:33 - 58:39)
rational yea yea though they'll watch (58:36 - 58:43)
the Scilla be movie thanks for that that (58:39 - 58:44)
was a point of contention in the car (58:43 - 58:47)
during boom mochi gear the Midwest game (58:44 - 58:50)
classic the sum of movies not good it (58:47 - 58:53)
got pretty heated I mean the end of the (58:50 - 58:55)
movie redeems the first terribleness (58:53 - 58:58)
that we called the first 30 minutes I (58:55 - 59:00)
just really like Celebi and that's (58:58 - 59:02)
really all that I have for that (59:00 - 59:08)
discussion I mean it is an onion no (59:02 - 59:10)
one's hating you they're good at good ol (59:08 - 59:13)
onion pokémon yes so there we ran out of (59:10 - 59:17)
ideas so if if you're interested in (59:13 - 59:19)
watching a Pokemon movie you have any (59:17 - 59:21)
questions you can just you can hit me up (59:19 - 59:23)
on Twitter you can DM me and slack (59:21 - 59:26)
either one of those options is fine but (59:23 - 59:28)
plan for mark your calendars for April (59:26 - 59:30)
22nd hopefully we can fill the room this (59:28 - 59:33)
this next time and then in times in the (59:30 - 59:34)
future (59:33 - 59:37)
I don't I I could keep talking tonight (59:34 - 59:39)
I'm not like I'm on I'm on an energy (59:37 - 59:41)
high at 1am but we should we should wrap (59:39 - 59:44)

is like this is like my 9am so shout out (59:48 - 59:57)
to all the third shifters uh that are (59:54 - 60:02)
wide awake right now what's uh what's on (59:57 - 60:03)
your agenda for the weekend you you (60:02 - 60:06)
streaming some more I'm gonna try and (60:03 - 60:08)
finish quantum break tomorrow I think (60:06 - 60:11)
what's obviously date is mr. this forum (60:08 - 60:13)
Thursday night I'm gonna try and finish (60:11 - 60:15)
quantum break I believe it's only about (60:13 - 60:17)
an eight to nine our game and we put (60:15 - 60:22)
about five or six in Tuesday night so I (60:17 - 60:25)
think we can probably finish it in one (60:22 - 60:26)
night and I'm looking forward to (60:25 - 60:28)
finishing that and then I I kind of want (60:26 - 60:30)
to check out the new ratchet and clank (60:28 - 60:32)
I've seen a lot of people a lot of other (60:30 - 60:34)
people playing it and I've never really (60:32 - 60:36)
been interested in series before but (60:34 - 60:39)
it's kind of a reboot so I feel like (60:36 - 60:43)
this is a good entry point I was kind of (60:39 - 60:44)
itching to play it but I think I'll just (60:43 - 60:47)
wait for the movie is it is it like a (60:44 - 60:50)
movie game I don't totally understand (60:47 - 60:53)
what's going on here so the new ratchet (60:50 - 60:56)
and clank game is based on the movie (60:53 - 60:57)
that comes out at the end of the month (60:56 - 61:01)
right but the movie is based on the very (60:57 - 61:04)
first retching clanking okay the movie (61:01 - 61:06)
is based on the game but the game is (61:04 - 61:10)
based on the movie got it really (61:06 - 61:14)
confusing but I got there very from from (61:10 - 61:16)
what I've heard from reviews and other (61:14 - 61:18)
podcasts this discussion the game is (61:16 - 61:22)
very self aware that is it is based on a (61:18 - 61:23)
movie which is based on the game which (61:22 - 61:25)
is ultimately a remake but not quite a (61:23 - 61:28)
remake because there because it's based (61:25 - 61:30)
on a movie it sounds like my kind of (61:28 - 61:33)
confusion yes (61:30 - 61:36)
so I may do that but Dark Souls 3 also (61:33 - 61:39)
came out I heard that was having a lot (61:36 - 61:41)
of problems it is that's kind of why I'm (61:39 - 61:43)
staying away from it for the time being (61:41 - 61:45)
because the last thing the things that (61:43 - 61:46)
I've been playing the most in the last (61:45 - 61:48)
couple months have been dark souls 1 in (61:46 - 61:50)
Dark Souls 2 because I'd never completed (61:48 - 61:52)
them before and I wanted to finish them (61:50 - 61:55)
before three came out so 13 came out a (61:52 - 61:57)
lot of people a lot of viewers were like (61:55 - 62:00)
why aren't you playing dark souls 3 but (61:57 - 62:02)
I've heard that a lot of people are (62:00 - 62:06)
having some ma known glitch issues with (62:02 - 62:09)
the game um so I'm gonna kind of maybe (62:06 - 62:11)
wait that out until some of that stuff (62:09 - 62:13)
is patched but that's on the horizon as (62:11 - 62:16)
well of course next week is Star Fox (62:13 - 62:20)
zero so that have you may be a thing may (62:16 - 62:27)
may be a thing well we'll see well if (62:20 - 62:28)

central time the vr vs vr vs code is (62:54 - 63:02)
just P cam and cast all lower case and (62:59 - 63:04)
we usually have a good turnout for that (63:02 - 63:06)
we usually have 20 or so people playing (63:04 - 63:09)
poker in tournament with us and I lose a (63:06 - 63:11)
lot but it's still fun definitely (63:09 - 63:14)
getting better at that we will be back (63:11 - 63:15)

nineteenth so at seven p.m. central time (63:22 - 63:28)
that'll be episode 7 of dungeons and (63:25 - 63:31)
dragon eyes and we're kind of pinning (63:28 - 63:34)
down about 10 to 12 episodes of that (63:31 - 63:36)
depending on how much of story we get (63:34 - 63:38)
through per episode we'll we'll refine (63:36 - 63:40)
that and then once that season is over (63:38 - 63:43)
we'll take a will take a a month or so (63:40 - 63:45)
off and just kind of rework things for (63:43 - 63:46)
season 2 because that has been (63:45 - 63:49)
a little more successful than i (63:46 - 63:52)
originally imagined and it does very (63:49 - 63:55)
well in itunes which is great because (63:52 - 63:58)
other people have found it super (63:55 - 63:59)
effective because of dungeons recognize (63:58 - 64:01)
just because it it's hitting a different (63:59 - 64:04)
audience it's unique it's a very very (64:01 - 64:07)
unique take on just standard Dungeons (64:04 - 64:09)
and Dragons yeah yeah i think it's it's (64:07 - 64:12)
fun to do I look forward to it but it's (64:09 - 64:13)
a it's like crazy cuz I'm like reading (64:12 - 64:17)
off this calendar of like Oh Mike we're (64:13 - 64:19)
doing this on Tuesday we're doing this (64:17 - 64:21)

this movie night and it's like Pokemon (64:21 - 64:25)
back i was doing a lot of with a lot of (64:23 - 64:29)
things a week now yep which is a little (64:25 - 64:32)
exhausting i got i have to get my final (64:29 - 64:34)
fantasy 14 at my destiny and and my (64:32 - 64:38)
classroom I gotta get this all in before (64:34 - 64:40)
Pokemon Sun and Moon but I think that (64:38 - 64:43)
will that will wrap things up for (64:40 - 64:44)
today's show I mean I could keep talking (64:43 - 64:46)
but I gotta edit this and get it out to (64:44 - 64:47)
you guys so I think that's kind of (64:46 - 64:53)
important as well ah editing to edit man (64:47 - 64:56)
we just you know no edits put it up call (64:53 - 64:58)
it raw that's raw comedy you're hearing (64:56 - 65:01)
right here we'd want to edit out our (64:58 - 65:05)
rock but raw raw content just it's the (65:01 - 65:09)
best I'm not going to harsh on any (65:05 - 65:13)
podcast but if you say that you do not (65:09 - 65:16)
want to edit because you think that rock (65:13 - 65:19)
comedy is funnier (65:16 - 65:21)
I hate to break it to you just clean it (65:19 - 65:24)
up a little bit all right this and and (65:21 - 65:25)
that that's that's to any podcast that (65:24 - 65:30)
is not picking on any specific topic or (65:25 - 65:33)
genre that is to any podcast like (65:30 - 65:35)
editing is super important you know it's (65:33 - 65:38)
just professionalism just make it make (65:35 - 65:41)
it look make it sound professional this (65:38 - 65:43)
is like this is the part of podcast I (65:41 - 65:46)
purposely put in like huge like blanks (65:43 - 65:49)
space between us talking it sounds like (65:46 - 65:52)
really awkward (65:49 - 65:52)
well I think I think that wraps it up (65:58 - 66:06)
