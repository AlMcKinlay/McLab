your host Steve with me is Greg hello I (0:35 - 0:39)
am here (0:38 - 0:43)
it is cold but not in this room which is (0:39 - 0:44)
why I'm wearing a t-shirt instead of the (0:43 - 0:47)
18 layers I was wearing earlier (0:44 - 0:50)
it is roasting up here (0:47 - 0:53)
it is freezing in my house but uh Hannah (0:50 - 0:56)
how is the room temperature where you (0:53 - 0:59)
are room temperature is good I had a (0:56 - 1:01)
heater on for about 30 minutes before we (0:59 - 1:03)
started recording so that it would not (1:01 - 1:05)
be too cold in the basement where I am (1:03 - 1:07)
at the moment (1:05 - 1:09)
I like (1:07 - 1:11)
how Hannah's in a different room every (1:09 - 1:13)
episode yeah it's a thing it's going to (1:11 - 1:15)
be a new location eventually we just (1:13 - 1:16)
have to get a green screen and be like (1:15 - 1:21)
it's Paris Mars I I have one more big (1:16 - 1:24)
move sometime this year and then I think (1:21 - 1:25)
that'll be it (1:24 - 1:27)
there are a couple different different (1:25 - 1:29)
locations in this house but then after (1:27 - 1:31)
this I have one more big move (1:29 - 1:34)
and then that'll be it I think I'm (1:31 - 1:36)
excited for the bathroom podcast oh no (1:34 - 1:38)
it's got real great Acoustics in there (1:36 - 1:40)
you get everything done (1:38 - 1:43)
one stop it next week to see where (1:40 - 1:45)
Hannah is (1:43 - 1:45)
side one time oh yeah there we go Park (1:46 - 1:52)
[Laughter] (1:50 - 1:56)
okay so we have probably two of the (1:52 - 1:59)
weirdest news articles this week uh one (1:56 - 2:01)
is regarding uh fish (1:59 - 2:03)
and the other is uh regarding Pokemon (2:01 - 2:06)
sleep which is you know weird at this (2:03 - 2:08)
point but you we we'll take what we can (2:06 - 2:10)
get uh also going to talk about Greninja (2:08 - 2:13)
also come Faye is coming to unite (2:10 - 2:17)
um so I'm sure Greg is oh boy yeah look (2:13 - 2:20)
at there Let's uh let's just kick off (2:17 - 2:21)
with the Pokemon sleep (2:20 - 2:22)
um (2:21 - 2:25)
now this is off Pokemon go hub.net they (2:22 - 2:28)
do a lot of Pokemon go news and you're (2:25 - 2:33)
probably like why would Pokemon go (2:28 - 2:36)
websites report on this it's because (2:33 - 2:38)
pretty much all of the Pokemon sleep (2:36 - 2:41)
stuff we've gotten so far has been (2:38 - 2:46)
through updates in Pokemon go (2:41 - 2:47)
um just little hints in the data mines (2:46 - 2:51)
yeah I can't remember the last time we (2:47 - 2:53)
reported on this uh (2:51 - 2:56)
I think it was maybe five or six months (2:53 - 2:59)
ago where Pokemon go got like two decent (2:56 - 3:02)
updates where there was new sleep stuff (2:59 - 3:03)
added (3:02 - 3:06)
to whatever sleep is supposed to do with (3:03 - 3:07)
Pokemon go I don't think anyone knows (3:06 - 3:09)
what it's supposed to do but although (3:07 - 3:12)
this new news gives us maybe a hint (3:09 - 3:14)
maybe yeah (3:12 - 3:15)
yeah um (3:14 - 3:18)
statistics for y'all just when we get (3:15 - 3:19)
there (3:18 - 3:24)
uh so uh the there is a new patent (3:19 - 3:25)
um (3:24 - 3:28)
uh first off Pokemon sleep.com was (3:25 - 3:30)
redirecting to a patent application (3:28 - 3:33)
within the United States patent and (3:30 - 3:35)
trademark office uh the patent was (3:33 - 3:38)
called gamification of Health Awareness (3:35 - 3:40)
based on sleep patterns with the (3:38 - 3:42)
applicant being the Pokemon company (3:40 - 3:45)
Tokyo Japan the patent's date was (3:42 - 3:49)
November 17 2022 which means that this (3:45 - 3:52)
wasn't like a patent from 2020 right it (3:49 - 3:55)
was a relatively new patent (3:52 - 3:57)
um (3:55 - 3:59)
and uh (3:57 - 4:02)
the abstract (3:59 - 4:05)
patent picture here is a user breeds a (4:02 - 4:08)
virtual life form by practicing good (4:05 - 4:11)
sleep habits then stay is I'm assuming (4:08 - 4:13)
that's an egg uh and then stays (4:11 - 4:16)
motivated towards practicing good sleep (4:13 - 4:18)
habits while enjoying breeding the (4:16 - 4:20)
virtual life form (4:18 - 4:23)
A Game's server manages progress of (4:20 - 4:25)
breeding the game's virtual life form (4:23 - 4:27)
the game server includes circuitry (4:25 - 4:31)
configured to acquire sleep data that at (4:27 - 4:33)
least includes a sleep pattern (4:31 - 4:36)
indicating a bedtime a wake-up time for (4:33 - 4:40)
the user uh stores the user's sleep data (4:36 - 4:42)
as sleep history and updates the (4:40 - 4:45)
breeding game based on the sleep pattern (4:42 - 4:46)
of History (4:45 - 4:50)
and there's like pictures of Pikachu (4:46 - 4:52)
and of course it's like there's pictures (4:50 - 4:54)
of things like very generic terms like (4:52 - 4:58)
character monster creature (4:54 - 4:58)
um (5:02 - 5:04)
I'm excited (5:06 - 5:12)
yeah I don't know a lot about patents (5:09 - 5:14)
here they they have like a background (5:12 - 5:17)
the solution to the problem the the then (5:14 - 5:19)
that's I mean they they said there are (5:17 - 5:22)
their article here on Pokemon go hub.net (5:19 - 5:24)
is pretty lengthy for what I'm sure most (5:22 - 5:26)
people don't care about they probably (5:24 - 5:28)
like is it coming or is it not I think (5:26 - 5:31)
is the general consensus (5:28 - 5:33)
here's my fun fact for the podcast (5:31 - 5:37)
90 97 of all patents never become (5:33 - 5:40)
anything (5:37 - 5:40)
in the U.S yep (5:41 - 5:44)
yes and just saying (5:45 - 5:51)
we've this game has beneficially (5:49 - 5:54)
announced there have been pieces of it (5:51 - 5:58)
in the data months for Pokemon go I (5:54 - 6:00)
am someone who gets really really poor (5:58 - 6:02)
sleep and I really want this to be a (6:00 - 6:04)
thing because Pokemon might be able to (6:02 - 6:05)
help with that (6:04 - 6:09)
um because Pokemon encourages me but (6:05 - 6:11)
so I'm going to try to remain optimistic (6:09 - 6:14)
and hopeful for this game because there (6:11 - 6:17)
continue being little things that feel (6:14 - 6:20)
like it's still coming (6:17 - 6:20)
oh and (6:22 - 6:25)
yes (6:24 - 6:27)
[Laughter] (6:25 - 6:29)
the way this looks at least (6:27 - 6:33)
I wasn't expecting as much as there is (6:29 - 6:36)
in the patent I kind of glanced at the (6:33 - 6:37)
news and didn't click into it because I (6:36 - 6:40)
didn't expect there to be as much as (6:37 - 6:42)
there is there (6:40 - 6:44)
um and the first (6:42 - 6:47)
thought that I get when I read through (6:44 - 6:50)
just the very generic terms there is (6:47 - 6:52)
that maybe Pokemon sleep is going to be (6:50 - 6:56)
how you breed Pokemon and Pokemon go (6:52 - 6:56)
[Music] (6:56 - 6:58)
um (6:56 - 6:58)
yeah I don't know the (6:59 - 7:02)
the thing I wanted from Pokemon sleep (7:04 - 7:10)
was the the Pokemon plus plus which I (7:06 - 7:13)
thought that was more exciting (7:10 - 7:15)
out of that (7:13 - 7:17)
so we can if we can rewind a little bit (7:15 - 7:19)
because this was (7:17 - 7:22)
they announced Pokemon sleep (7:19 - 7:25)
what was that 20 before the pandemic (7:22 - 7:28)
right yeah (7:25 - 7:31)
right at the start or just before no it (7:28 - 7:33)
was long before (7:31 - 7:36)
wasn't that early I thought it was 20. (7:33 - 7:38)
it was it almost did a while ago sword (7:36 - 7:40)
and shield right yeah I think so before (7:38 - 7:42)
starting shield box yeah it was the same (7:40 - 7:45)
around the same time as sword and shield (7:42 - 7:47)
um I think people say 2019 I feel like (7:45 - 7:49)
it was earlier but I think it's (7:47 - 7:51)
I've heard 2019 (7:49 - 7:53)
28th 2019. (7:51 - 8:00)
May 28th 2019 got it yep so the (7:53 - 8:03)
when they when they announced it (8:00 - 8:04)
um there's a there's a bunch of Pokemon (8:03 - 8:06)
stuff that like got announced around (8:04 - 8:08)
that time that none of it came to (8:06 - 8:10)
fruition like the detective Pikachu (8:08 - 8:12)
sequel that was now the detective (8:10 - 8:14)
Pikachu on the switch and there was (8:12 - 8:17)
somebody who works at creatures (8:14 - 8:19)
creatures is the the company making (8:17 - 8:22)
detective Pikachu that randomly tweeted (8:19 - 8:23)
like (8:22 - 8:25)
seven months ago that yeah we're still (8:23 - 8:28)
working on detective Pikachu like (8:25 - 8:28)
I mean uh take that for what it is (8:29 - 8:34)
um (8:32 - 8:36)
and then they they announced Pokemon (8:34 - 8:37)
sleep and then they announced the (8:36 - 8:41)
Pokemon go plus plus which (8:37 - 8:43)
in this time you know I've I've I've (8:41 - 8:47)
heard that when they initially announced (8:43 - 8:50)
Pokemon sleep that they didn't even (8:47 - 8:52)
start making the game that's what I (8:50 - 8:55)
heard from whatever sources you want to (8:52 - 8:57)
take that from I'm not really at Liberty (8:55 - 8:58)
to say but I heard when Pokemon sleep (8:57 - 9:01)
got announced uh the game wasn't even in (8:58 - 9:02)
development (9:01 - 9:05)
but we do know who the developer is it (9:02 - 9:08)
is select button they made the ever so (9:05 - 9:12)
hit ever so famous Magikarp jump (9:08 - 9:16)
um which I thought that was a fun game (9:12 - 9:18)
it was fun for the five minutes that I (9:16 - 9:20)
played it (9:18 - 9:21)
I knew a whole lot of people who don't (9:20 - 9:23)
usually play Pokemon games who picked it (9:21 - 9:26)
up it was light-hearted and easy to just (9:23 - 9:28)
sort of jump in and jump out (9:26 - 9:31)
you had a good frame rate I remember (9:28 - 9:36)
yes I mean it looked good (9:31 - 9:36)
um so Magikarp jump came out in May of (9:37 - 9:43)
2017. (9:40 - 9:45)
uh (9:43 - 9:47)
and then there was an update in August (9:45 - 9:50)
of 2017 and that was made by select (9:47 - 9:51)
button like I said and then that was (9:50 - 9:54)
published by the Pokemon company (9:51 - 9:55)
um (9:54 - 9:57)
so since so going back to sleep it was (9:55 - 9:59)
announced (9:57 - 10:02)
the plus plus was announced (9:59 - 10:04)
um Pokemon go I said updates since then (10:02 - 10:06)
with the (10:04 - 10:08)
with whatever code is supposed to link (10:06 - 10:10)
the two together (10:08 - 10:12)
the whole deal of the Pokemon go plus (10:10 - 10:14)
plus was it was this device that worked (10:12 - 10:16)
with Pokemon go just like your current (10:14 - 10:18)
Pokemon go plus worked or your current (10:16 - 10:20)
Pokeball plus worked (10:18 - 10:23)
but you would be able to put this under (10:20 - 10:24)
your pillow and that would be the thing (10:23 - 10:26)
that would measure sleep (10:24 - 10:28)
so part of my speculation was the reason (10:26 - 10:31)
it was possibly delayed was delayed (10:28 - 10:33)
and we don't know this maybe we will (10:31 - 10:35)
know this eventually (10:33 - 10:37)
um or maybe we'll never know why it was (10:35 - 10:38)
delayed or maybe it was never delayed (10:37 - 10:40)
maybe this was the plan was to announce (10:38 - 10:41)
it (10:40 - 10:43)
who knows (10:41 - 10:45)
um but part of my speculation of why it (10:43 - 10:47)
possibly was delayed or not here yet is (10:45 - 10:49)
because when the pandemic did happen (10:47 - 10:52)
which obviously no one planned for (10:49 - 10:54)
um anything that was electronic chips (10:52 - 10:57)
for computers chips for cars (10:54 - 11:01)
um gadgets Apple TV and whatever if it (10:57 - 11:03)
was if it turned on with a power button (11:01 - 11:05)
it got delayed because of the assembly (11:03 - 11:07)
lines in (11:05 - 11:12)
uh the world literally everywhere (11:07 - 11:12)
you know not to throw any shade at the (11:13 - 11:17)
Pokemon company but I feel like they are (11:16 - 11:19)
they're very frugal and they'll take the (11:17 - 11:22)
cheapest route so if uh if they needed (11:19 - 11:24)
to make you know thousands of these (11:22 - 11:26)
Pokeball go plus pluses because the app (11:24 - 11:29)
you need you theoretically need this to (11:26 - 11:30)
put under your pillow for it to work (11:29 - 11:31)
yeah (11:30 - 11:32)
I think that they also said that your (11:31 - 11:34)
phone could detect it as well you didn't (11:32 - 11:37)
need the external device (11:34 - 11:37)
um (11:37 - 11:39)
yeah I'm not sure how that (11:40 - 11:45)
maybe they couldn't get that tour I I (11:43 - 11:47)
again don't know how it works right yes (11:45 - 11:49)
there are sleep apps out there that just (11:47 - 11:51)
use your phone I used one called sleep (11:49 - 11:52)
cycle for a very long time you have to (11:51 - 11:55)
like have it on you like we're under (11:52 - 11:58)
your pillow it uses the gyroscope it (11:55 - 12:00)
uses all of the things and it uses the (11:58 - 12:01)
microphone it picks up all the same (12:00 - 12:04)
things that the go plus plus would or (12:01 - 12:07)
will it just uses your phone instead of (12:04 - 12:09)
the external device (12:07 - 12:09)
right but if if if they want to sell (12:10 - 12:17)
these little devices yes the devices the (12:14 - 12:19)
exciting part they need to make millions (12:17 - 12:21)
of them and we already know we know this (12:19 - 12:23)
for sure when they release the Pokeball (12:21 - 12:26)
go plus the thing that if you're (12:23 - 12:27)
watching the YouTube videos on Hannah's (12:26 - 12:31)
shirt that thing was impossible to find (12:27 - 12:34)
for a long time and then they made a (12:31 - 12:36)
bunch for like a second shipment and (12:34 - 12:37)
then they just decided to stop making it (12:36 - 12:39)
for whatever reason they were like okay (12:37 - 12:43)
we're done making this (12:39 - 12:46)
so the other interesting thing is uh I (12:43 - 12:48)
remember running into John Hankey when I (12:46 - 12:51)
was in Germany and uh well I I don't I (12:48 - 12:52)
honestly don't remember which Youtuber (12:51 - 12:54)
asked but one of the YouTubers well I it (12:52 - 12:56)
might have been Zoe two dots or or (12:54 - 12:58)
somebody (12:56 - 13:00)
um asked John Hankey if they would make (12:58 - 13:01)
more (13:00 - 13:04)
not make new ones but to like make the (13:01 - 13:07)
more Pokeball go pluses because there (13:04 - 13:08)
are third-party ones out there which (13:07 - 13:11)
Niantic does not like Niantic does not (13:08 - 13:14)
like the third party stuff (13:11 - 13:15)
um (13:14 - 13:18)
and the answer from John was pretty much (13:15 - 13:19)
like (13:18 - 13:21)
I personally he pretty much said like he (13:19 - 13:22)
didn't like the Pokeball Plus or the (13:21 - 13:24)
Pokemon go plus because it didn't (13:22 - 13:26)
interact the way he wanted people to (13:24 - 13:27)
interact with go but like he also was (13:26 - 13:29)
like that's not my decision and then (13:27 - 13:31)
somebody brought up like Pokemon sleep (13:29 - 13:33)
and he was like I don't also not my he's (13:31 - 13:35)
like I don't really that also not my (13:33 - 13:37)
decision right like well that's a whole (13:35 - 13:38)
different game that's all I got it (13:37 - 13:39)
though (13:38 - 13:41)
I'm honestly surprised he doesn't like (13:39 - 13:43)
it as much because this this little (13:41 - 13:45)
device is what gets me out walking to (13:43 - 13:48)
play the game more than a lot of other (13:45 - 13:50)
things in the game because there are (13:48 - 13:52)
times when I wouldn't (13:50 - 13:55)
uh be able to be looking at my phone (13:52 - 13:57)
but I'm still able to go out and play (13:55 - 13:59)
Pokemon go for a very long amount of (13:57 - 14:01)
time and then I end up playing the game (13:59 - 14:03)
more later as I am sorting through those (14:01 - 14:05)
Pokemon and using those Pokemon and PVP (14:03 - 14:07)
because I got good ones while I was out (14:05 - 14:08)
with my go Plus (14:07 - 14:11)
yeah I mean he didn't really expand on (14:08 - 14:14)
why he didn't like it right and and (14:11 - 14:17)
just because the CEO doesn't like (14:14 - 14:18)
something doesn't mean that like his (14:17 - 14:20)
decision is final right somebody (14:18 - 14:22)
somebody very smart at Niantic could be (14:20 - 14:25)
like Mr Hanky like we have proven that (14:22 - 14:27)
people with this device actually end up (14:25 - 14:28)
playing the game more than people (14:27 - 14:30)
without that's why we should have it (14:28 - 14:32)
right like there's a bunch of (14:30 - 14:35)
that's why I was like hesitant to say (14:32 - 14:36)
like because I don't want anyone to run (14:35 - 14:38)
away being like we're never getting (14:36 - 14:40)
another Pokeball go plus because John (14:38 - 14:44)
hanky one time in Germany at dinner (14:40 - 14:44)
it does remind me of that uh that like (14:45 - 14:51)
that story that we we covered that as (14:48 - 14:53)
well of like somebody was like I sat on (14:51 - 14:55)
the plane next yeah (14:53 - 14:57)
next to John Hankey these are the eight (14:55 - 15:00)
questions I asked him here's here's how (14:57 - 15:02)
I annoyed this poor man on a terrible (15:00 - 15:05)
experience that called the flight this (15:02 - 15:06)
is what I did (15:05 - 15:08)
he tried to put in headphones and I was (15:06 - 15:09)
like no (15:08 - 15:13)
you're listening to me now (15:09 - 15:13)
um (15:13 - 15:16)
so what I'm saying is uh level 50 will (15:14 - 15:18)
eventually come to everyone per John (15:16 - 15:21)
Hankey on the airplane (15:18 - 15:21)
is the other thing I didn't really think (15:22 - 15:25)
about until I read this article I (15:23 - 15:26)
started going back to the Pokemon sleep (15:25 - 15:28)
thing is (15:26 - 15:29)
um (15:28 - 15:32)
I I follow Apple news very closely and (15:29 - 15:35)
the the whole like sleep I would say is (15:32 - 15:38)
tied to health right and Apple has been (15:35 - 15:41)
very weird about not weird but like very (15:38 - 15:44)
cautious about their health claims uh (15:41 - 15:45)
because if they need if they want to (15:44 - 15:47)
claim certain things they have to get (15:45 - 15:48)
certain approval (15:47 - 15:51)
so uh they're very very cautious about (15:48 - 15:54)
this and I wonder if there was some (15:51 - 15:57)
Maybe not maybe sleep is maybe no one (15:54 - 15:58)
cares about sleep but because this is (15:57 - 16:00)
related to health I wonder if this was (15:58 - 16:03)
what was delaying things is oh we need (16:00 - 16:05)
certain approval if we're going to say (16:03 - 16:06)
we're going to measure sleep in the (16:05 - 16:08)
United States (16:06 - 16:10)
that's (16:08 - 16:11)
possibly part of (16:10 - 16:12)
part of it there's a lot that goes into (16:11 - 16:15)
that like we are gathering personal (16:12 - 16:17)
medical data because (16:15 - 16:20)
sleep your sleep cycle (16:17 - 16:22)
you need amount of sleep you get our (16:20 - 16:26)
medical records and so there's a lot not (16:22 - 16:29)
as much I think as there should be but (16:26 - 16:30)
there are Hoops you have to go through (16:29 - 16:32)
to be able to say I'm collecting this (16:30 - 16:35)
I'm storing this but also you have to (16:32 - 16:39)
have a way of saying I'm stripping (16:35 - 16:42)
identifiable personal data you have to (16:39 - 16:46)
say that you are yeah they don't they (16:42 - 16:48)
just have to say that they do well you (16:46 - 16:50)
can say that you do and you can but it (16:48 - 16:52)
doesn't make it right completely right (16:50 - 16:54)
detached from the person that's the (16:52 - 16:57)
problem there uh so there's a lot (16:54 - 17:00)
um that has to go into collecting (16:57 - 17:02)
personal medical (17:00 - 17:06)
history and that is in essence what (17:02 - 17:09)
sleep is doing whether or not you're (17:06 - 17:11)
like I'm using it to help me sleep all (17:09 - 17:13)
these things are collecting your (17:11 - 17:17)
personal medical data the other thing to (17:13 - 17:20)
be aware of is on the flip side of it is (17:17 - 17:23)
what do they plan on doing with that (17:20 - 17:26)
data and that is something that I want (17:23 - 17:29)
to know when this comes out like what (17:26 - 17:30)
are you doing (17:29 - 17:32)
because there's no way you're not (17:30 - 17:34)
selling this to people (17:32 - 17:36)
who are you selling it to what are they (17:34 - 17:40)
using it for how what overall things are (17:36 - 17:41)
you selling (17:40 - 17:44)
I'm intrigued in it in the fact that I (17:41 - 17:46)
do think it can help people but seeing (17:44 - 17:50)
as we have seen multiple companies (17:46 - 17:53)
who have done real sketchy things by (17:50 - 17:54)
collecting data on people (17:53 - 17:59)
I I get nervous when they step into this (17:54 - 18:02)
field and I want to know exactly what (17:59 - 18:04)
they're doing before I like jump into (18:02 - 18:07)
this more or less nervous than Pokemon (18:04 - 18:08)
go (18:07 - 18:09)
well (18:08 - 18:12)
so Pokemon go I (18:09 - 18:17)
don't play as much anymore uh and the (18:12 - 18:19)
one of the big things was them changing (18:17 - 18:21)
a lot of the ways that you had to be (18:19 - 18:23)
outside changing those when it became (18:21 - 18:25)
much much more clear that it's like a (18:23 - 18:27)
lot of your decisions are about how you (18:25 - 18:29)
want to track our data than how you want (18:27 - 18:31)
us to actually use your game from a (18:29 - 18:33)
consumer standpoint I got really turned (18:31 - 18:35)
away from Pokemon go (18:33 - 18:39)
um so I generally now only play it (18:35 - 18:41)
when I know I'm not going anywhere with (18:39 - 18:44)
uh Commerce in it (18:41 - 18:46)
Community Days where I'm always at the (18:44 - 18:48)
same mall or at the park that also (18:46 - 18:50)
doesn't have Commerce in it otherwise I (18:48 - 18:52)
don't really open up that game much like (18:50 - 18:55)
I don't go to Target and I don't attach (18:52 - 18:57)
to their Wi-Fi anymore like there's a (18:55 - 18:59)
lot of things that I've just stopped (18:57 - 19:01)
doing as (18:59 - 19:04)
they have slid especially post pandemic (19:01 - 19:08)
the the high ranking bar they just keep (19:04 - 19:11)
sliding it down there's just that uh (19:08 - 19:13)
Home Depot Scandal where yep if you were (19:11 - 19:15)
like they'll ask you for your your email (19:13 - 19:18)
for your receipt which for me is I would (19:15 - 19:20)
rather not print the paper I like (19:18 - 19:22)
organizing my email and then we just (19:20 - 19:24)
found out that Home Depot was just (19:22 - 19:27)
selling all of our emails to everyone (19:24 - 19:28)
and (19:27 - 19:30)
I stopped doing it for a lot of reasons (19:28 - 19:31)
one of them was like I didn't do (19:30 - 19:33)
anything with the receipt anyways if (19:31 - 19:34)
you're just gonna let me come in and (19:33 - 19:36)
leave I don't don't think that it helps (19:34 - 19:39)
me is coming back to return it yeah and (19:36 - 19:41)
the the bad thing about (19:39 - 19:45)
that is that's how they sort of get you (19:41 - 19:47)
into the habit of giving them your (19:45 - 19:50)
information is if this is broken you (19:47 - 19:52)
need to return it well you need to prove (19:50 - 19:54)
that you purchase it from us which is (19:52 - 19:55)
why I pretty much now stick to paper (19:54 - 19:57)
receipts I'm just like just give me the (19:55 - 19:59)
receipt like if this is how we're gonna (19:57 - 20:02)
be I I'm also going to make you cost (19:59 - 20:05)
money I'm going to charge you as well (20:02 - 20:06)
because that cost you money and you want (20:05 - 20:08)
you want the cheap way of doing things (20:06 - 20:10)
and I'm not about that life anymore much (20:08 - 20:12)
like I don't like getting e-bills (20:10 - 20:14)
anymore I'm like nope you're a bad (20:12 - 20:16)
company so you get to pay the 50 cents (20:14 - 20:18)
to send me letters because I know that (20:16 - 20:20)
cost you money and this is my revenge (20:18 - 20:23)
for being horrible (20:20 - 20:23)
I I think that's a great question Greg (20:25 - 20:29)
of like what do they want to do with the (20:27 - 20:32)
Sleep data the only thing I can think of (20:29 - 20:35)
which is still very powerful is (20:32 - 20:39)
companies want to be on your home screen (20:35 - 20:41)
of your phone (20:39 - 20:44)
there is uh (20:41 - 20:47)
there was a there was a huge study (20:44 - 20:50)
um a couple years back of like (20:47 - 20:53)
which apps make it to your actual like (20:50 - 20:55)
home screen or your iPhone or your or (20:53 - 20:57)
your Android phone right like Facebook (20:55 - 20:59)
is up there Twitter is up there (20:57 - 21:01)
Instagram is up there WhatsApp (20:59 - 21:02)
um (21:01 - 21:04)
and (21:02 - 21:07)
like that is that is a a company's dream (21:04 - 21:09)
is to be on your home page because if (21:07 - 21:11)
you're on the home page it's something (21:09 - 21:13)
crazy it's like 80 more likely to open (21:11 - 21:15)
on a daily basis if you are on the home (21:13 - 21:17)
page versus if you're on page two it's (21:15 - 21:18)
like a (21:17 - 21:20)
80s probably not (21:18 - 21:23)
uh accurate but like the study had the (21:20 - 21:24)
exact numbers of like there's a huge (21:23 - 21:26)
difference of being on page one and page (21:24 - 21:27)
two (21:26 - 21:28)
um or there's a huge difference of being (21:27 - 21:30)
on page one (21:28 - 21:33)
in a folder versus paid being in page (21:30 - 21:35)
one but so (21:33 - 21:38)
if if you're making an app that is that (21:35 - 21:41)
is you know ideally the last app you're (21:38 - 21:43)
supposed to check before you go to bed (21:41 - 21:46)
that's powerful and then it's ideally is (21:43 - 21:47)
supposed to be the first app you check (21:46 - 21:50)
when you wake up also very powerful (21:47 - 21:52)
right that that in itself makes it seem (21:50 - 21:54)
like oh I'm gonna move this app to my (21:52 - 21:55)
home page (21:54 - 21:57)
which I think any company would want to (21:55 - 21:59)
be on the home page of your phone but if (21:57 - 22:01)
your home page is actually the second (21:59 - 22:04)
page I dump things on my phone home page (22:01 - 22:06)
that I don't want to look at I keep it (22:04 - 22:09)
on my second page at all times (22:06 - 22:09)
I will say what are they gonna do with (22:10 - 22:14)
the Sleep data there's so much there's (22:12 - 22:16)
so many things you can do with sleep (22:14 - 22:17)
data you can tell when people are sick (22:16 - 22:19)
you can tell when people have unusual (22:17 - 22:21)
sleep patterns you can tell who needs to (22:19 - 22:23)
sleep more you can tell who needs (22:21 - 22:25)
advertisements for sleep medication that (22:23 - 22:27)
may or may not work you can tell when (22:25 - 22:29)
they're awake to receive your (22:27 - 22:31)
advertisements you can tell when they're (22:29 - 22:32)
alert you can tell when they're not (22:31 - 22:36)
alert you can get the times to send them (22:32 - 22:38)
things because we all know as you are (22:36 - 22:40)
getting sleepy it's a good time because (22:38 - 22:42)
you're very suggestible like there's a (22:40 - 22:45)
lot that goes that advertisers want with (22:42 - 22:47)
this data (22:45 - 22:49)
um that (22:47 - 22:53)
ain't great but again (22:49 - 22:55)
many people won't care right like your (22:53 - 22:57)
level of how much you want to keep your (22:55 - 23:00)
personal data secret private is up to (22:57 - 23:04)
you like there is no real good answer (23:00 - 23:06)
for any of this it really comes down (23:04 - 23:10)
what is your level of comfort knowing (23:06 - 23:13)
this level of detail (23:10 - 23:16)
is going out to somebody and once it's (23:13 - 23:19)
out it is out of your control like you (23:16 - 23:21)
can't go and say well you can request (23:19 - 23:23)
hey delete all my data and they'll say (23:21 - 23:25)
done you have no idea if that happened (23:23 - 23:28)
right like (23:25 - 23:31)
it is it is (23:28 - 23:33)
up to you to decide I mean again I hope (23:31 - 23:36)
the patent works that they are actually (23:33 - 23:37)
making something that they do something (23:36 - 23:39)
and people get (23:38 - 23:41)
a lot of enjoyment out of it (23:39 - 23:43)
understanding the full risks but I think (23:41 - 23:47)
this is one of the more risky (23:43 - 23:49)
things as far as privacy that they've (23:47 - 23:51)
done in a long time (23:49 - 23:53)
I will I do want to talk about the other (23:51 - 23:55)
side of the coin though just a little (23:53 - 23:57)
bit because sleep and knowledge of how (23:55 - 24:00)
important sleep is is gaining in (23:57 - 24:03)
popularity at least in the circles I'm (24:00 - 24:06)
in and the society that I see that (24:03 - 24:08)
understanding that sleep is important (24:06 - 24:11)
and a valuable piece of life and thing (24:08 - 24:14)
and something you actually need that is (24:11 - 24:15)
something that people are understanding (24:14 - 24:17)
more and more so if this is something (24:15 - 24:19)
that gets people to understand that even (24:17 - 24:21)
better and understand the right up there (24:19 - 24:24)
with eating drinking breathing air sleep (24:21 - 24:27)
is something that all animals do and (24:24 - 24:29)
humans need to do if this is something (24:27 - 24:31)
that helps with that I (24:29 - 24:35)
want that yeah I mean the the benefits (24:31 - 24:37)
are good right like understanding your (24:35 - 24:42)
sleep cycle again there's a lot of weird (24:37 - 24:45)
mystical stuff in the middle of knowing (24:42 - 24:47)
your sleep habits actually being able to (24:45 - 24:50)
make a change like that's a little dicey (24:47 - 24:54)
Drawing the Line generally being aware (24:50 - 24:57)
of how you sleep is a good thing that (24:54 - 25:00)
said you don't need a device to do that (24:57 - 25:04)
but if this helps you great just go in (25:00 - 25:06)
knowing (25:04 - 25:10)
dishes like I'm fully aware that by my (25:06 - 25:12)
my tracking my workouts on my Apple (25:10 - 25:15)
watch I am giving Apple a lot of but how (25:12 - 25:19)
I exercise and how much exercise I do (25:15 - 25:23)
but I need that also for my own tracking (25:19 - 25:27)
so I am comfortable with selling (25:23 - 25:30)
my workout routine basically (25:27 - 25:33)
so that I can keep track for my own (25:30 - 25:36)
needs it is a trade-off (25:33 - 25:37)
I mean if they were talking about any (25:36 - 25:39)
company I trust my data with it's (25:37 - 25:41)
probably Apple it's fine (25:39 - 25:45)
there yeah I mean they have some issues (25:41 - 25:48)
so but they're they're less than others (25:45 - 25:51)
they're slightly above the bar compared (25:48 - 25:53)
to a bunch of either who are so far (25:51 - 25:56)
below the bar believe me I I I am behind (25:53 - 25:57)
the scenes of a lot of major (25:56 - 26:00)
corporations and boy (25:57 - 26:03)
welcome to the Pokemon Center data (26:00 - 26:05)
privacy podcast (26:03 - 26:05)
apps before in the past I have (26:05 - 26:10)
kick-started different boy I've (26:08 - 26:12)
kick-started different sleep apps which (26:10 - 26:14)
they sent you like things to put on your (26:12 - 26:17)
arm when you go to sleep and then you (26:14 - 26:18)
wake up the next day and that company is (26:17 - 26:20)
suddenly out of business and you're like (26:18 - 26:22)
well I just bought this 80 device that (26:20 - 26:24)
had only worked for two months now that (26:22 - 26:26)
company is gone (26:24 - 26:26)
um (26:26 - 26:29)
but my I guess my personal personal (26:26 - 26:31)
problem with the sleep stuff is (26:29 - 26:33)
I can't really do anything with that (26:31 - 26:36)
data I wake up and I'm like it says you (26:33 - 26:38)
slept badly no I don't need you to tell (26:36 - 26:41)
me that I I I feel it right now (26:38 - 26:43)
and then it's like you should go to bed (26:41 - 26:45)
more early again I don't need you to (26:43 - 26:47)
tell me that I know I should probably go (26:45 - 26:49)
to bed early but there is Pokemon based (26:47 - 26:52)
motivation for going to bed on time then (26:49 - 26:54)
maybe yeah so the last thing I need is (26:52 - 26:58)
more reasons to go to sleep like I given (26:54 - 27:00)
doing this right now or sleeping I would (26:58 - 27:02)
still probably pick sleeping because I (27:00 - 27:05)
love sleep so much I think (27:02 - 27:08)
what the Sleep apps are supposed to do (27:05 - 27:11)
is let you know (27:08 - 27:15)
how deep your sleep actually is and then (27:11 - 27:18)
you can go and sort of talk about like I (27:15 - 27:19)
slept for (27:18 - 27:23)
you know 10 hours but I never hit deep (27:19 - 27:25)
sleep like it never registered me going (27:23 - 27:28)
into REM sleep there might there might (27:25 - 27:29)
be a problem (27:28 - 27:33)
for different things yeah but like these (27:29 - 27:36)
are all different things that (27:33 - 27:39)
the lay person can just look at numbers (27:36 - 27:41)
and they only become useful if you're (27:39 - 27:43)
actually talking to a sleep specialist (27:41 - 27:46)
like here's my track history I don't (27:43 - 27:48)
sleep well I've done everything I think (27:46 - 27:50)
I do this is what it says can we start (27:48 - 27:52)
from here but chances are they're going (27:50 - 27:54)
to throw you into their own sleep study (27:52 - 27:56)
with much better equipment than this (27:54 - 27:58)
oh yeah yeah you want me in that room (27:56 - 28:00)
with like 18 cameras watching you as (27:58 - 28:01)
yourself (28:00 - 28:04)
the the go plus plus is not going to be (28:01 - 28:06)
anywhere near the most accurate sleep (28:04 - 28:08)
tracker but if it helps people (28:06 - 28:10)
start to regulate a sleep schedule (28:08 - 28:13)
motivates people to go to bed earlier (28:10 - 28:15)
could help (28:13 - 28:18)
if it exists if it comes out if it comes (28:15 - 28:21)
out I mean I think (28:18 - 28:24)
I I want to know (28:21 - 28:27)
once it manifest then I'm really (28:24 - 28:29)
interested in what it's doing how it (28:27 - 28:32)
works what the benefits are and (28:29 - 28:34)
hopefully they'll let us know what (28:32 - 28:35)
they're doing with your stuff on the (28:34 - 28:38)
back end even if it's PR stuff like (28:35 - 28:41)
at least let us know what you plan to do (28:38 - 28:43)
with our data (28:41 - 28:46)
also like what if it's just a bad game (28:43 - 28:49)
when it's just not like not I'm like (28:46 - 28:52)
that's always possible magic was good (28:49 - 28:53)
though (28:52 - 28:55)
but like Magikarp jump was good and like (28:53 - 28:57)
those five minute increments right I (28:55 - 28:58)
don't know anyone who sat there and (28:57 - 28:59)
played Magikarp jumped three hours (28:58 - 29:03)
straight like you you it was designed to (28:59 - 29:05)
you know come and do a little thing you (29:03 - 29:07)
know come back an hour do a little thing (29:05 - 29:09)
speaking of a little thing (29:07 - 29:11)
comfy is a little thing come into (29:09 - 29:13)
Pokemon Unite (29:11 - 29:17)
uh this is off nintendolife.com (29:13 - 29:20)
uh the an official tweet from the (29:17 - 29:22)
Pokemon unite Twitter Flower Power is (29:20 - 29:24)
coming to EOS Island come Faye joins (29:22 - 29:29)
Pokemon unite on February 2nd (29:24 - 29:30)
um (29:29 - 29:34)
uh last year's unite reveals were (29:30 - 29:37)
spoiled due to a data mind which we then (29:34 - 29:41)
found out was Sableye clefable zorark uh (29:37 - 29:43)
then we recently found out Dragon pulp (29:41 - 29:44)
came (29:43 - 29:46)
um I think they're I think we know that (29:44 - 29:48)
zashian is next after a company yeah (29:46 - 29:52)
they've the well they this believe that (29:48 - 29:54)
the free (29:52 - 29:56)
one we get for Pokemon day (29:54 - 29:59)
will be zashian that is the current (29:56 - 30:01)
belief we don't know if that's actually (29:59 - 30:03)
true but that is that is the current (30:01 - 30:05)
belief (30:03 - 30:05)
good free one people like zashian yeah I (30:06 - 30:09)
mean like we look at the past we got (30:08 - 30:13)
Hoopa we got Mew who post free (30:09 - 30:15)
yeah yeah I mean you had to play the (30:13 - 30:17)
game to get the tickets to get it I'm (30:15 - 30:18)
with the assumptions that you have to do (30:17 - 30:20)
the same precautions (30:18 - 30:22)
like you have to you have to play (30:20 - 30:23)
together (30:22 - 30:26)
just don't log in and get it right looks (30:23 - 30:28)
like you had to play and do the puzzle (30:26 - 30:30)
to get the free Mew like you had to put (30:28 - 30:31)
all the pieces together and then you got (30:30 - 30:34)
Mew so you're paying with with grinding (30:31 - 30:35)
through the game like you were (30:34 - 30:37)
complaining about last week yeah with (30:35 - 30:41)
your time playing with your time (30:37 - 30:41)
so yeah Pokemon though you could just (30:42 - 30:46)
log in and get well they'd there have (30:44 - 30:48)
been some there have been some there (30:46 - 30:50)
have been some and they may do it with (30:48 - 30:53)
this one we don't we don't know but the (30:50 - 30:55)
last couple of free mythicals and (30:53 - 30:58)
legendaries and stuff were all play the (30:55 - 31:00)
game x amount of times the the weird (30:58 - 31:03)
thing is is like (31:00 - 31:05)
they do it so like if you log in once (31:03 - 31:07)
and play one game by the end of the (31:05 - 31:09)
period if you do that every day (31:07 - 31:12)
you would get it like you can get it (31:09 - 31:14)
faster by playing the game a lot but (31:12 - 31:18)
generally most of them were log in do a (31:14 - 31:21)
quick battle that's X if you do that for (31:18 - 31:23)
14 days you get it (31:21 - 31:25)
I started playing the game right before (31:23 - 31:30)
the end of that Mew puzzle thing and (31:25 - 31:32)
there was not enough time no matter how (31:30 - 31:34)
much I played that game no to get that (31:32 - 31:36)
Pokemon no (31:34 - 31:39)
uh yeah comfy is here and threatens to (31:36 - 31:41)
break the game completely so everybody's (31:39 - 31:43)
excited (31:41 - 31:44)
um (31:43 - 31:47)
I I did not look at any data mine stuff (31:44 - 31:49)
I'm sure is comfy even on the test (31:47 - 31:51)
server yeah yes it is and a lot of (31:49 - 31:54)
people are very (31:51 - 31:58)
unhappy uh from what I've been told Greg (31:54 - 32:00)
you can verify this is comfy is similar (31:58 - 32:04)
to a unit in League of Legends and in (32:00 - 32:07)
League of Legends that it's a Healer by (32:04 - 32:08)
the way come face supposed to be a (32:07 - 32:10)
Healer character in League of Legends (32:08 - 32:12)
again never played League of Legends is (32:10 - 32:13)
just what I've been told League of (32:12 - 32:15)
Legends this character would attach to (32:13 - 32:17)
other characters and then constantly (32:15 - 32:20)
heal them and it's very very hated in (32:17 - 32:22)
the League of Legends Community it's (32:20 - 32:24)
like a mutual hatement I've been told (32:22 - 32:25)
like everyone in League of Legends (32:24 - 32:27)
already hates each other but they all (32:25 - 32:28)
come together (32:27 - 32:32)
character yeah so it is based and seems (32:28 - 32:34)
to work the exact same way that Yumi (32:32 - 32:38)
does uh so the biggest problem (32:34 - 32:41)
is when Yumi is attached and so far it (32:38 - 32:44)
seems to be the same for comfy when it's (32:41 - 32:48)
attached it does not become targetable (32:44 - 32:51)
so if it attaches to like a Snorlax who (32:48 - 32:53)
already is difficult to get done because (32:51 - 32:56)
it's so tanky you can't Target the thing (32:53 - 32:57)
that's healing it (32:56 - 32:59)
because you can't (32:57 - 33:04)
do it so you have this thing that is a (32:59 - 33:06)
player in the game (33:04 - 33:08)
that you can't interact with and it just (33:06 - 33:11)
sits there and can do whatever without (33:08 - 33:13)
being punished and the weird thing is (33:11 - 33:15)
that they added is (33:13 - 33:19)
so let's say Snorlax is down 50 health (33:15 - 33:22)
and Company heals it for a hundred (33:19 - 33:25)
it goes 50 and then puts a 50 hit point (33:22 - 33:28)
shield on top so it's converting over (33:25 - 33:32)
healing that's worse into a shield which (33:28 - 33:34)
is really going to be not great so (33:32 - 33:36)
everybody who's mad at Sableye right now (33:34 - 33:37)
who's getting a Nerf we all knew it was (33:36 - 33:41)
coming this is this is potentially going (33:37 - 33:44)
to really divide the community a lot (33:41 - 33:47)
because it is I mean Yumi is known as a (33:44 - 33:48)
problem it's Yumi it's not as so much of (33:47 - 33:50)
a problem that the developers promised (33:48 - 33:51)
this year (33:50 - 33:54)
they are going to rework Yumi from the (33:51 - 33:57)
ground up and redo the entire character (33:54 - 34:00)
that's how much League Of Legend players (33:57 - 34:03)
have been I can't see me uh and it looks (34:00 - 34:05)
like comfy (34:03 - 34:08)
is basically the same as Yumi (34:05 - 34:10)
um so I (34:08 - 34:14)
it's going to be interesting because (34:10 - 34:16)
the issue is when they got when they (34:14 - 34:18)
changed the Rayquaza to a more Zapdos (34:16 - 34:21)
feel once again it became about (34:18 - 34:24)
surviving and over leveling (34:21 - 34:27)
and when you have a thing that cannot be (34:24 - 34:29)
targeted that helps certain that can go (34:27 - 34:31)
to any Pokemon and help them level up (34:29 - 34:33)
without being punished (34:31 - 34:36)
that really fundamentally changing it (34:33 - 34:40)
because the way it looks is cope as long (34:36 - 34:42)
as it's got its base ability may not (34:40 - 34:44)
ever need to be at a high level because (34:42 - 34:46)
it can't be targeted (34:44 - 34:47)
so it doesn't matter if your code phase (34:46 - 34:49)
level six if it has its full Suite of (34:47 - 34:50)
abilities (34:49 - 34:52)
it doesn't have to get experience other (34:50 - 34:55)
than Exp share which will get just by (34:52 - 34:57)
being attached because they also changed (34:55 - 35:02)
how XB share happens so it's like (34:57 - 35:05)
okay this could be a really big problem (35:02 - 35:07)
for unite and it's going to be (35:05 - 35:10)
interesting to see how it actually plays (35:07 - 35:12)
out in game (35:10 - 35:14)
okay how about this you can only get (35:12 - 35:17)
comfy if you spend thirty dollars (35:14 - 35:17)
uh I mean I figure it's going to be (35:19 - 35:25)
probably a huge chaos coin one like it's (35:21 - 35:27)
probably going to be a 14 or an 18 but (35:25 - 35:30)
who knows (35:27 - 35:32)
yeah I uh (35:30 - 35:34)
I will I will say as somebody who's done (35:32 - 35:36)
a lot of VGC comfy would normally sit (35:34 - 35:39)
next to a like a Lapras or gigantic Max (35:36 - 35:40)
Lapras or something and it was equally (35:39 - 35:43)
as annoying in that situation because it (35:40 - 35:44)
would kind of do the same thing it would (35:43 - 35:47)
it would sit there and heal (35:44 - 35:49)
um because its ability triage would make (35:47 - 35:51)
it go first if it was using a healing (35:49 - 35:52)
Type move it's it's a very unique (35:51 - 35:54)
ability (35:52 - 35:55)
um or it would just you know Ally switch (35:54 - 35:58)
and that was equally annoying (35:55 - 36:00)
um (35:58 - 36:03)
but uh yeah on the Twitter they released (36:00 - 36:05)
some of its moves (36:03 - 36:07)
um which are interesting nothing that (36:05 - 36:08)
we're (36:07 - 36:11)
uh the biggest thing they did to confirm (36:08 - 36:13)
which we all knew is that it does attach (36:11 - 36:17)
it does do shields it does do HP and (36:13 - 36:17)
then (36:17 - 36:19)
uh (36:17 - 36:23)
it does it does have uh (36:19 - 36:26)
Grass Knot as its ability (36:23 - 36:32)
um so it's damaged and uh hindrance (36:26 - 36:34)
so (36:32 - 36:35)
if it's attached to somebody can use (36:34 - 36:37)
those moves basically if it's attached (36:35 - 36:39)
to an attacker it can lock whoever (36:37 - 36:41)
they're attacking in place making it (36:39 - 36:44)
difficult for them to leave (36:41 - 36:44)
we got we got a lot of we had a lot of (36:44 - 36:48)
questions about what company is going to (36:46 - 36:49)
do with this game (36:48 - 36:52)
well uh we we will be able to talk about (36:49 - 36:54)
it next week yeah because it comes out (36:52 - 36:56)
this week so yeah (36:54 - 36:59)
all right uh let's take a break uh when (36:56 - 37:00)
we come back we're gonna talk about the (36:59 - 37:01)
fish uh and we're gonna talk about (37:00 - 37:04)
Greninja which is a frog uh so we will (37:01 - 37:07)
be right back (37:04 - 37:07)
and we are back from our break let's (37:08 - 37:13)
talk Greninja (37:11 - 37:16)
he was right it's here I carried your (37:13 - 37:18)
wug across the finish line (37:16 - 37:22)
you would have failed without me so we (37:18 - 37:24)
need to have this discussion about how (37:22 - 37:28)
awesome I am I will say I I will give (37:24 - 37:32)
Greg so much credit in the world (37:28 - 37:34)
one it's very rare for Greg and I to (37:32 - 37:37)
agree on anything uh number two everyone (37:34 - 37:38)
still thinks Greg and I hate each other (37:37 - 37:41)
yeah number three Greg and I think talk (37:38 - 37:44)
every single day (37:41 - 37:44)
um (37:46 - 37:50)
so uh okay before we get into the Greg (37:47 - 37:53)
and I story about the wug uh (37:50 - 37:55)
Seven Star Greninja by the time this is (37:53 - 37:57)
up is gone uh Greninja will work I'll be (37:55 - 37:59)
back again on February 10th through (37:57 - 38:01)
February 12th uh it did have the ability (37:59 - 38:05)
protein it did not have battle Bond (38:01 - 38:07)
um uh it was also the poison Terror type (38:05 - 38:10)
which is still confusing to some people (38:07 - 38:11)
out there yeah (38:10 - 38:14)
we look we're here to educate people on (38:11 - 38:15)
Pokemon (38:14 - 38:18)
um it does it it still has water and (38:15 - 38:19)
dark type moves because it's still (38:18 - 38:21)
technically water dark type Pokemon but (38:19 - 38:23)
when it's stereotype changes to poison (38:21 - 38:24)
it's only weak to what poison is weak (38:23 - 38:26)
two which in this case would be ground (38:24 - 38:29)
uh and psychic (38:26 - 38:32)
um it had six moves where uh Charizard (38:29 - 38:34)
had eight uh (38:32 - 38:38)
cinderace had five uh this had six so we (38:34 - 38:41)
have hydro pump which was kind of a (38:38 - 38:43)
shocker that didn't have water yeah I (38:41 - 38:45)
thought for sure would have water sugar (38:43 - 38:48)
and it didn't it didn't uh my I guess I (38:45 - 38:50)
guess maybe the speculation or the (38:48 - 38:52)
assumption would be water shuriken took (38:50 - 38:54)
too much time off the clock because it (38:52 - 38:56)
would have to calculate every hit yeah (38:54 - 38:58)
that makes sense (38:56 - 39:01)
um so it had water shuriken night slash (38:58 - 39:04)
so this made it a mixed attacker uh Gunk (39:01 - 39:07)
shot toxic spikes ice beam and double (39:04 - 39:10)
team so and I was correct but toxic (39:07 - 39:14)
spikes yeah if you went out there was (39:10 - 39:15)
one time I was doing a random where I (39:14 - 39:17)
was like you know what these people are (39:15 - 39:19)
weird people are having a tough time (39:17 - 39:22)
with toxic Spike so I let my Quagsire (39:19 - 39:25)
die because when a poison type comes in (39:22 - 39:27)
it eats up all the toxic spikes (39:25 - 39:29)
and fixes the problem because it never (39:27 - 39:32)
toxic spices again (39:29 - 39:35)
yeah so I I guess the pattern here is (39:32 - 39:37)
that all three of these raid bosses did (39:35 - 39:39)
two things before you could do anything (39:37 - 39:41)
so Charizard would normally overheat and (39:39 - 39:43)
then reset stats that's two things (39:41 - 39:46)
Cinder ice would bulk up and then attack (39:43 - 39:49)
you that's two things Greninja would uh (39:46 - 39:52)
toxic spikes and double team (39:49 - 39:55)
uh I I think thematically (39:52 - 39:58)
uh this had like the most thought go in (39:55 - 40:02)
uh for being like a poison ninja said (39:58 - 40:04)
yeah like the double team is very (40:02 - 40:06)
ninja-y the toxic spikes is very ninja-y (40:04 - 40:08)
uh (40:06 - 40:08)
um (40:08 - 40:12)
I do like the the I whether this was (40:08 - 40:14)
intentional or not I don't know but (40:12 - 40:16)
hydro pump and gunshot are not 100 (40:14 - 40:19)
accurate uh hydro pump is 85 accurate (40:16 - 40:23)
gunshot is 80 accurate (40:19 - 40:26)
and so it was kind of like this back and (40:23 - 40:28)
forth of you missing your moves and (40:26 - 40:32)
Greninja missing their moves yeah (40:28 - 40:35)
which was like there are ways around (40:32 - 40:37)
that right like you could you could you (40:35 - 40:38)
could get rid of the double team stuff (40:37 - 40:41)
by clear Smog or Haze or you know taunt (40:38 - 40:44)
to prevent future double teams but (40:41 - 40:46)
I didn't think the evasion stuff was (40:44 - 40:49)
that big of a deal uh because even (40:46 - 40:52)
so like (40:49 - 40:54)
there's it's four verse one so even if (40:52 - 40:57)
like two Pokemon miss the ideally (40:54 - 41:01)
hopefully the third one yeah (40:57 - 41:01)
um (41:01 - 41:04)
Hannah did you get a chance to do any (41:02 - 41:05)
Greninja (41:04 - 41:08)
I did I did three three battles I won (41:05 - 41:10)
the third one and then I have not had (41:08 - 41:12)
time to do any since then I built a (41:10 - 41:15)
cleft key for it and because because I (41:12 - 41:17)
love Cloud sire so much I built a cleft (41:15 - 41:18)
key for it because I figured everyone (41:17 - 41:21)
was gonna be playing with cloudstar (41:18 - 41:23)
um and I kind of regret not playing (41:21 - 41:25)
cloudstar I think I would have enjoyed (41:23 - 41:26)
it a little bit more (41:25 - 41:28)
um but (41:26 - 41:31)
I mean (41:28 - 41:31)
people are still having trouble with it (41:31 - 41:35)
that's for sure I don't think it's as (41:33 - 41:36)
hard as the others at least in the same (41:35 - 41:39)
ways and I think that the (41:36 - 41:41)
double team did kind of throw in a oh (41:39 - 41:43)
this is kind of fun this is kind of new (41:41 - 41:45)
element to it I think they're doing a (41:43 - 41:48)
good job with that it made (41:45 - 41:50)
the thing I don't like about it is it (41:48 - 41:52)
made it much more swingy because one of (41:50 - 41:54)
the ones I did (41:52 - 41:56)
I think the first time we tried to do (41:54 - 41:59)
wug I missed oh maybe we should we maybe (41:56 - 42:01)
we should yeah we'll talk about the (41:59 - 42:02)
first time I did the raid was Steve I (42:01 - 42:05)
missed my move one of my moves five (42:02 - 42:08)
times in a row which is not a great (42:05 - 42:11)
experience right like it is really (42:08 - 42:13)
frustrating to be like (42:11 - 42:17)
oh I could win this but this is really (42:13 - 42:20)
this is when the random chance thing (42:17 - 42:22)
comes in (42:20 - 42:25)
really negatively and watching other (42:22 - 42:27)
people do streams in other streams (42:25 - 42:29)
that's a common complaint like (42:27 - 42:32)
what am I supposed to do when I miss (42:29 - 42:36)
eight moves in a row like how like we (42:32 - 42:38)
have all the right builds but we're just (42:36 - 42:40)
not allowed to hit it it that part I (42:38 - 42:42)
think it made sense but the fact that it (42:40 - 42:45)
would do it multiple multiple multiple (42:42 - 42:48)
times was like okay this is (42:45 - 42:49)
not (42:48 - 42:51)
bright fun (42:49 - 42:55)
yeah on the flip side I okay so I (42:51 - 42:57)
I made the YouTube video right I made (42:55 - 42:59)
all the Instagram Graphics of Pokemon (42:57 - 43:01)
that would work with Greninja or against (42:59 - 43:03)
Greninja but that also would work (43:01 - 43:05)
together so Cloud side or clef key (43:03 - 43:08)
um who else was on that gosh uh toxicity (43:05 - 43:11)
uh Etc (43:08 - 43:12)
um and I'm really happy that they all (43:11 - 43:14)
they all turned out and worked well it (43:12 - 43:15)
was kind of funny because also none of (43:14 - 43:17)
those Pokemon could be Toxic by toxic (43:15 - 43:19)
spikes except for the gastrodon which is (43:17 - 43:21)
ironically like the one Pokemon that (43:19 - 43:23)
probably shouldn't be dying at all right (43:21 - 43:25)
right yes sir Don's dying there's (43:23 - 43:27)
probably an issue there (43:25 - 43:31)
um but uh for some reason my twitch chat (43:27 - 43:34)
thought that me battling with what trio (43:31 - 43:36)
would have been incredibly entertaining (43:34 - 43:40)
and so uh I built a book Trio I looked I (43:36 - 43:43)
damn I calculated damage and I was like (43:40 - 43:45)
I need to do because somebody was like (43:43 - 43:47)
I'll put a salt vest on look Trio and I (43:45 - 43:48)
was like that you know ice beam and (43:47 - 43:50)
hydropub don't really matter that much I (43:48 - 43:51)
don't really need the assault fast I I (43:50 - 43:53)
need to not die to gunshot because I (43:51 - 43:56)
think as I was building it the first gun (43:53 - 43:58)
shot was doing 80 percent (43:56 - 44:00)
and I was like oh boy (43:58 - 44:03)
um and then I got it down to because I I (44:00 - 44:06)
put um I put my stats into like Max (44:03 - 44:07)
defense and stuff I got gunshot down to (44:06 - 44:09)
like okay well if it hits me it's about (44:07 - 44:13)
56 60 so that's not much better but it (44:09 - 44:14)
is better (44:13 - 44:16)
and I was like okay I'll put chilling (44:14 - 44:18)
water I'll you know I want my work Trio (44:16 - 44:20)
to still feel part of the team right so (44:18 - 44:23)
chilling water helps everyone (44:20 - 44:25)
um and then gosh what else it had like (44:23 - 44:28)
mud slap so I can learn accuracy so (44:25 - 44:31)
we're doing this missing so Greg was (44:28 - 44:33)
frustrated that they missed five times (44:31 - 44:37)
I'm over here cheering that yeah (44:33 - 44:41)
because I'm like one hit away from dying (44:37 - 44:43)
uh we beat Greninja with a low Trio so (44:41 - 44:44)
that was we did well (44:43 - 44:47)
the second time the second time the (44:44 - 44:49)
first five the first time we were very (44:47 - 44:50)
very close the thing is it's funny (44:49 - 44:54)
because I had I had done another podcast (44:50 - 44:56)
right before I joined so I had not been (44:54 - 44:59)
able to do any of the raids and I popped (44:56 - 45:01)
in and he was building this wig Trio and (44:59 - 45:03)
Steve's like who wants to do it I'm like (45:01 - 45:06)
you know what fine I'll do it I'll jump (45:03 - 45:07)
in I'll take the hit so that other (45:06 - 45:09)
people don't get salty for doing this (45:07 - 45:13)
really not great idea (45:09 - 45:15)
I mean but the thing is it's like (45:13 - 45:19)
we did it on the second one yeah like it (45:15 - 45:22)
worked like all all the pieces fit (45:19 - 45:27)
together fine but yeah people were like (45:22 - 45:31)
this is your first raid I'm like (45:27 - 45:34)
in this context not ever (45:31 - 45:35)
like (45:34 - 45:39)
let's be clear I do a lot of writing in (45:35 - 45:41)
a lot of games I know how the trial and (45:39 - 45:44)
error things that I do patch day raids (45:41 - 45:47)
in multiple MMOs that are the most (45:44 - 45:49)
frustrating thing in the world where you (45:47 - 45:52)
die for three hours straight yeah I'm (45:49 - 45:54)
not bothered by this (45:52 - 45:56)
yeah I don't think we've we've talked (45:54 - 45:58)
about like that tolerance of failure (45:56 - 46:02)
because raids are relatively new in in (45:58 - 46:04)
Pokemon right like even you could well (46:02 - 46:05)
they've been around for three years and (46:04 - 46:07)
sword and shield but like (46:05 - 46:09)
they're in the the franchise in the (46:07 - 46:12)
series relatively new (46:09 - 46:13)
um (46:12 - 46:16)
and you know coming from a final fantasy (46:13 - 46:18)
or a Destiny or a World of Warcraft (46:16 - 46:20)
where (46:18 - 46:23)
you know there there is a point in those (46:20 - 46:25)
games where it's like six people 14 (46:23 - 46:28)
people whatever get together they do it (46:25 - 46:29)
then then all right we'll see you next (46:28 - 46:32)
week and I'll do it again yeah next week (46:29 - 46:34)
but there is a whole other set of people (46:32 - 46:36)
that don't have like (46:34 - 46:39)
a reliable raid group or reliable (46:36 - 46:41)
friends that play every week so they (46:39 - 46:44)
they grab randoms and they sit there and (46:41 - 46:47)
they fail for two three hours and (46:44 - 46:49)
eventually they get it eventually yeah (46:47 - 46:51)
or the RNG works out (46:49 - 46:53)
um and they're like wow great that was a (46:51 - 46:55)
fun experience but like three hours of (46:53 - 46:57)
failing at the end we're like oh my gosh (46:55 - 46:58)
it felt so good and then they move on (46:57 - 47:00)
and (46:58 - 47:03)
I don't think that that tolerance has (47:00 - 47:04)
built up yet for a lot of people in the (47:03 - 47:06)
Pokemon Community where it's like I did (47:04 - 47:08)
Greninja twice I can't do it I'm never (47:06 - 47:11)
going to do it again kind of thing I (47:08 - 47:12)
have limiting factors that they haven't (47:11 - 47:17)
quite figured out yet for this is (47:12 - 47:19)
they need it I think they still need to (47:17 - 47:22)
kind of tweak the rewards a little bit (47:19 - 47:25)
um I think the rewards are good but I (47:22 - 47:27)
don't think they're great enough for you (47:25 - 47:29)
to go through the (47:27 - 47:31)
somewhat frustrating process of failing (47:29 - 47:33)
multiple times (47:31 - 47:35)
to when you like when you finally do it (47:33 - 47:36)
the first time and you catch the (47:35 - 47:38)
Greninja like that that's the Ultimate (47:36 - 47:39)
Prize (47:38 - 47:42)
and then (47:39 - 47:44)
is there a really great link to continue (47:42 - 47:47)
doing it after the stuff you get are (47:44 - 47:50)
okay but they're randomized and I I (47:47 - 47:54)
don't think they've tweaked up the (47:50 - 47:58)
rewards enough aft after you've done the (47:54 - 48:00)
first one you've caught the Pokemon to (47:58 - 48:02)
really encourage people to keep helping (48:00 - 48:05)
the community I think that that needs a (48:02 - 48:07)
little bit of (48:05 - 48:10)
a little bit of attention just a little (48:07 - 48:12)
little bit more to sweeten the pot (48:10 - 48:15)
I I agree with you I I if the game is (48:12 - 48:17)
smart enough to know whether or not you (48:15 - 48:19)
caught it it should know whether or not (48:17 - 48:21)
the people in the raids have also caught (48:19 - 48:23)
it so you know if (48:21 - 48:25)
if (48:23 - 48:29)
I'm doing I ended up doing I think 54 (48:25 - 48:30)
raids this weekend or something I didn't (48:29 - 48:32)
play on Saturday and play on Sunday it (48:30 - 48:33)
was only Thursday Friday I was counting (48:32 - 48:35)
them this time around (48:33 - 48:37)
and (48:35 - 48:39)
every single raid I did out of the 50 (48:37 - 48:43)
there was one to two new people (48:39 - 48:45)
um if not like all three new people and (48:43 - 48:47)
it was a lot of people that were like (48:45 - 48:48)
thank you so much like I built this (48:47 - 48:50)
Pokemon I was able to do with you I got (48:48 - 48:52)
it I feel great (48:50 - 48:53)
um (48:52 - 48:55)
and it's almost like I think I think in (48:53 - 48:57)
Final Fantasy (48:55 - 48:59)
if (48:57 - 49:01)
if you were like (48:59 - 49:03)
if if you did it but somebody else in (49:01 - 49:05)
the raid I could be wrong maybe correct (49:03 - 49:06)
me Greg if somebody else was new the (49:05 - 49:09)
person who did it a bunch of time will (49:06 - 49:11)
get more rewards because they noticed a (49:09 - 49:13)
new person was in there so it (49:11 - 49:15)
it that system has been tweaked somewhat (49:13 - 49:19)
there there are um rewards for helping (49:15 - 49:21)
new players get through (49:19 - 49:24)
um there are bigger rewards if you do (49:21 - 49:26)
dungeons where new players are going to (49:24 - 49:29)
be in them oh so you'll get more money (49:26 - 49:33)
or more of the tomes that you need to (49:29 - 49:35)
to buy better gear (49:33 - 49:37)
um I think one thing that MMOs are very (49:35 - 49:39)
good at is (49:37 - 49:42)
they build in things that don't (49:39 - 49:45)
necessarily change the game but help you (49:42 - 49:48)
customize so one thing that Pokemon (49:45 - 49:50)
doesn't do right now because they (49:48 - 49:53)
limited the customization option is that (49:50 - 49:57)
it would be nice if like unique items (49:53 - 49:59)
for your character fell in these things (49:57 - 50:02)
to give you a reason like oh I'm really (49:59 - 50:04)
going for a Froakie hat and this is the (50:02 - 50:06)
only time I can get that hat something (50:04 - 50:10)
Beyond to keep people invested because (50:06 - 50:12)
ultimately like we always everybody (50:10 - 50:14)
everybody's a Final Fantasy 14 player (50:12 - 50:17)
says the final boss is the Glam dresser (50:14 - 50:19)
that is the thing that we're all working (50:17 - 50:22)
towards we want to look our best we need (50:19 - 50:24)
to get the things you run older content (50:22 - 50:27)
just to get a a pair of gloves that (50:24 - 50:29)
matches this new outfit that you have (50:27 - 50:31)
and that's something that they just (50:29 - 50:33)
don't do because (50:31 - 50:35)
one of the things is like Tara shards (50:33 - 50:37)
how many fighting tarot shards do you (50:35 - 50:39)
have Steve like 19 billion that's maxed (50:37 - 50:41)
yeah so (50:39 - 50:42)
and how many times are you going to (50:41 - 50:44)
switch to that thing like we were (50:42 - 50:46)
worried that they weren't going to do it (50:44 - 50:48)
enough and now it's like well this is (50:46 - 50:52)
the main reward and I don't need them I (50:48 - 50:53)
think that's crazy you say that because (50:52 - 50:55)
I have 999 tarot shards right but I only (50:53 - 51:00)
have like 30 ground tarot shards and my (50:55 - 51:01)
I caught a shiny clouds are completely (51:00 - 51:04)
like oh I I just stumbled upon a shiny (51:01 - 51:05)
Whooper I caught it was a great perfect (51:04 - 51:07)
I'm gonna build this for the raid and it (51:05 - 51:09)
was poison and not ground (51:07 - 51:11)
and that's like the not the worst Terror (51:09 - 51:12)
type (51:11 - 51:14)
um like like it still resists a lot of (51:12 - 51:16)
Booker ninja I had but I was like I (51:14 - 51:17)
literally can't change it to the better (51:16 - 51:20)
Terror type because Greninja starts in (51:17 - 51:24)
in a day and I I where am I supposed to (51:20 - 51:26)
find a bunch of ground Terror raids to (51:24 - 51:27)
grind this out like I live this is what (51:26 - 51:29)
I was talking about months ago with like (51:27 - 51:31)
tournament stuff if you're about to you (51:29 - 51:33)
know do a tournament and the night (51:31 - 51:36)
before like you're 20 shards short like (51:33 - 51:40)
good luck yeah I'm sure you could do it (51:36 - 51:42)
um I'm sure you can move your clock over (51:40 - 51:44)
and over and over again to find what you (51:42 - 51:46)
want but like that's not a great way to (51:44 - 51:48)
go into a tournament of like oh I could (51:46 - 51:50)
be practicing battles but instead I (51:48 - 51:52)
gotta go battle uh ground corvinite over (51:50 - 51:54)
here (51:52 - 51:57)
yeah it's it (51:54 - 52:00)
I think they I mean this is I I agree (51:57 - 52:05)
that the raids are are a good direction (52:00 - 52:06)
like I think these need to stick around (52:05 - 52:10)
but I do think like every other MMO out (52:06 - 52:11)
there like every other game that's had (52:10 - 52:14)
this they need to look at (52:11 - 52:18)
how the rewards incentivize doing these (52:14 - 52:22)
actions and I'm curious to see (52:18 - 52:25)
again how much (52:22 - 52:29)
more or people start redoing this again (52:25 - 52:30)
when it comes around the second time (52:29 - 52:32)
because like there's a ton of people who (52:30 - 52:35)
got it this time so do the numbers drop (52:32 - 52:37)
off are people going to do it like do (52:35 - 52:39)
people have a desire to do it knowing (52:37 - 52:41)
like because I don't think any herbic (52:39 - 52:44)
can fall from it nope so one of the most (52:41 - 52:47)
sought after things doesn't drop from (52:44 - 52:48)
this raid (52:47 - 52:52)
and is that enough of an incentive to (52:48 - 52:53)
keep (52:52 - 52:55)
doing this with random people especially (52:53 - 52:57)
when you jump in and it's too slow Bros (52:55 - 53:00)
and a Vaporeon like are you gonna suffer (52:57 - 53:03)
through that for what for what for what (53:00 - 53:06)
ending and again it's not even that (53:03 - 53:07)
right like you can jump in and you'd be (53:06 - 53:09)
like oh well I guess it's quad tires (53:07 - 53:11)
level 60 like yeah I guess we lose (53:09 - 53:15)
because yeah it's not the right level (53:11 - 53:18)
um I mean that is also one thing as one (53:15 - 53:20)
thing that I wish they would also take (53:18 - 53:24)
from MMOs are you must be at this level (53:20 - 53:27)
to sign up for this like (53:24 - 53:30)
ff14 raids say you have to have an item (53:27 - 53:34)
level of like 610 which means you have (53:30 - 53:37)
to be at a certain level in the game (53:34 - 53:39)
have run enough of these things to (53:37 - 53:42)
gather that gear to be able to take on (53:39 - 53:44)
this content and I I (53:42 - 53:47)
really wish that they would Implement (53:44 - 53:49)
something like that to stop just to stop (53:47 - 53:53)
frustration just to let people know (53:49 - 53:55)
this is the expectation for this because (53:53 - 53:57)
they've been really bad at setting the (53:55 - 53:59)
actual expectation and relying on (53:57 - 54:01)
content creators to do that heavy (53:59 - 54:03)
lifting for them (54:01 - 54:05)
and when the levels make it hard for the (54:03 - 54:07)
entire team to do it especially when (54:05 - 54:09)
you're doing it with randoms it's just a (54:07 - 54:11)
worse to worse experience (54:09 - 54:13)
yeah and you also don't know when you go (54:11 - 54:15)
in like right you don't know until after (54:13 - 54:17)
you can't see until after you're like I (54:15 - 54:19)
have no idea (54:17 - 54:22)
why did that Cloud sire die in two (54:19 - 54:24)
seconds (54:22 - 54:25)
what's going on (54:24 - 54:28)
well it's also like I I I realize this (54:25 - 54:30)
more this past week (54:28 - 54:32)
um because you know I made six Pokemon (54:30 - 54:35)
right and one of the Pokemon was a (54:32 - 54:36)
hydragon (54:35 - 54:38)
um and I knew when I made hydragon that (54:36 - 54:40)
it was weak to a possible ice move right (54:38 - 54:43)
like I calculated all the ice moves that (54:40 - 54:46)
Greninja had prior to it (54:43 - 54:48)
um it was like blizzard Ice Beam icy (54:46 - 54:50)
wind and ice punch and I was like okay (54:48 - 54:53)
well based on the hydrogon build I did (54:50 - 54:56)
the Ice Beam would do uh it would it (54:53 - 54:58)
would be like a four shot it would be (54:56 - 55:00)
about 25 of its health so I was like (54:58 - 55:01)
okay that's still really good right like (55:00 - 55:03)
surviving four moves from a raid boss is (55:01 - 55:05)
still really good especially like that's (55:03 - 55:06)
not counting light screens or reflects (55:05 - 55:10)
or chilling Waters or snarls or (55:06 - 55:13)
um whatever like heel chairs right so (55:10 - 55:17)
like surviving for is is relatively good (55:13 - 55:20)
um and so when I built the Hydra gun it (55:17 - 55:22)
was it was you know earth power super (55:20 - 55:23)
effective very strong move hydrigan has (55:22 - 55:25)
a crazy good special attack right and (55:23 - 55:27)
then of the other move was like snarl (55:25 - 55:30)
and snarl for those that don't know like (55:27 - 55:32)
lower Greninja special attack so if (55:30 - 55:33)
great ninja did have ice beam or (55:32 - 55:35)
blizzard it would do less damage that (55:33 - 55:36)
was the whole point scenario was there (55:35 - 55:38)
and then there was like other moves (55:36 - 55:40)
right like Focus energy you know (55:38 - 55:42)
whatever and (55:40 - 55:45)
throughout both my like Instagram and (55:42 - 55:47)
YouTube there were there were people (55:45 - 55:48)
that were like I used her hydrogen and (55:47 - 55:50)
it didn't work I just lost the ice beam (55:48 - 55:52)
and I asked all I think it was five (55:50 - 55:54)
people I was like well did you open up (55:52 - 55:57)
using snarl and they all said no why (55:54 - 55:58)
would I snarl (55:57 - 56:00)
so it's like you can give people these (55:58 - 56:03)
tools but they they still make up yeah (56:00 - 56:05)
might not know how to Pilot pilot it (56:03 - 56:06)
right like in my head with Hydra again (56:05 - 56:08)
it's like well you you always snarl turn (56:06 - 56:10)
one that's the whole point of snarling (56:08 - 56:13)
because like now Greninja is negative (56:10 - 56:15)
one for everyone like everyone's ice (56:13 - 56:17)
like everyone's taking less damage from (56:15 - 56:19)
Ice Beam or hydro pump (56:17 - 56:20)
um and then you know one star with (56:19 - 56:22)
hydrogen lets hydrogen survive six ice (56:20 - 56:24)
beams instead of four so it's like again (56:22 - 56:26)
you can give these tools to people (56:24 - 56:28)
um which I think we see a lot you know (56:26 - 56:29)
we talked about the slow Bros and we've (56:28 - 56:31)
talked about the vaporeons (56:29 - 56:33)
these tools are out there but they're (56:31 - 56:34)
not (56:33 - 56:36)
people don't know how to Pilot them (56:34 - 56:36)
right (56:36 - 56:38)
and then it's frustrating for everyone (56:36 - 56:39)
on the team because it's like you watch (56:38 - 56:42)
a Slowbro do what they're told to do and (56:39 - 56:44)
then all of a sudden they have to start (56:42 - 56:45)
over yeah I mean they don't have the (56:44 - 56:47)
skills to adapt right they haven't (56:45 - 56:49)
developed the skills to adapt but I I (56:47 - 56:50)
will say I have one complaint about your (56:49 - 56:52)
high dragon (56:50 - 56:55)
you left off the 70 chance of it getting (56:52 - 56:58)
Frozen yeah yeah I should have put that (56:55 - 57:00)
in the details for some reason hydrogen (56:58 - 57:03)
got more Frozen than everyone else (57:00 - 57:07)
I legit got Frozen turn one in a match I (57:03 - 57:09)
cheered myself D thought I immediately (57:07 - 57:11)
got poisoned I'm like okay well I'll I'm (57:09 - 57:12)
okay (57:11 - 57:15)
and I can't get Frozen if I'm poisoning (57:12 - 57:17)
somebody else healed cheers as soon as (57:15 - 57:20)
they removed the poison I got frozen (57:17 - 57:23)
okay see you needed to put that on (57:20 - 57:26)
because ten percent (57:23 - 57:26)
70 on all dragon types it's in the code (57:26 - 57:32)
data mine it baby uh (57:29 - 57:34)
sometimes RNG can be really uh really (57:32 - 57:38)
cruel and really yeah it's a it's a (57:34 - 57:41)
cruel thing again I think (57:38 - 57:42)
you know the game (57:41 - 57:45)
unlike a lot of games that have rating (57:42 - 57:47)
and dungeons in it the game doesn't do a (57:45 - 57:50)
good job of teaching you your skills (57:47 - 57:52)
um and this is just an example of the (57:50 - 57:55)
main gameplay not teaching you how to do (57:52 - 57:57)
something so completely different and I (57:55 - 58:00)
I'm hoping like again we will see a (57:57 - 58:02)
different experience next weekend (58:00 - 58:03)
because people have had a weekend to (58:02 - 58:05)
learn this is how raids go they begin to (58:03 - 58:08)
pick up on how to do the tools if (58:05 - 58:09)
they're really interested in getting it (58:08 - 58:11)
they will turn away from the game and go (58:09 - 58:14)
to the internet and find out what went (58:11 - 58:19)
wrong why didn't this work and it is not (58:14 - 58:23)
great that a lot of games force you to (58:19 - 58:26)
go outside of itself to get the training (58:23 - 58:29)
you need to play their game effectively (58:26 - 58:32)
um but it's brand new right like (58:29 - 58:36)
you know MMOs have only recently added (58:32 - 58:38)
in an entire tutorial section that you (58:36 - 58:41)
can go into that says here's how you run (58:38 - 58:42)
a dungeon (58:41 - 58:45)
and this is what the roles are and this (58:42 - 58:47)
like they've finally started putting (58:45 - 58:49)
that in games (58:47 - 58:51)
um so I think (58:49 - 58:53)
hopefully we will see that added I hope (58:51 - 58:55)
this feature continues and they'll be (58:53 - 58:58)
able to add more of that to the game but (58:55 - 59:00)
we are just going to struggle for a (58:58 - 59:03)
while because it is these rates are (59:00 - 59:07)
unlike anything else they do in the game (59:03 - 59:10)
yeah um the the other thing I want to (59:07 - 59:14)
say is I I think it's funny (59:10 - 59:15)
um that (59:14 - 59:19)
you know for I mean Greg and Hannah (59:15 - 59:20)
could probably attest to this uh you (59:19 - 59:23)
know as as we're all adults and we're (59:20 - 59:25)
we're playing Pokemon the the insta (59:23 - 59:27)
complaint is well that's a children's (59:25 - 59:30)
game right or that game's made for (59:27 - 59:32)
children uh it's the same it's the same (59:30 - 59:33)
like logic (59:32 - 59:36)
or energy of like somebody watching (59:33 - 59:37)
wrestling and then the person being like (59:36 - 59:39)
well you know it's fake like (59:37 - 59:42)
like yes it's like what what are you (59:39 - 59:45)
trying to accomplish with this yeah like (59:42 - 59:45)
um (59:45 - 59:47)
and (59:45 - 59:50)
I I read I I read something where it was (59:47 - 59:53)
like these raids are too hard how are (59:50 - 59:55)
kids supposed to do this which is funny (59:53 - 59:57)
because like for the longest time yeah (59:55 - 60:00)
these games are so easy like like we (59:57 - 60:03)
finally get an ounce of difficulty and I (60:00 - 60:05)
would say there's plenty of hard stuff (60:03 - 60:06)
that has happened in Pokemon like I (60:05 - 60:08)
genuinely think the the battle Tree in (60:06 - 60:10)
ultrasound Ultra moon was incredibly (60:08 - 60:13)
difficult uh for an average person like (60:10 - 60:15)
if you if if you're asking if you're if (60:13 - 60:17)
you're saying like I don't I've never (60:15 - 60:18)
really EV trained I've never really (60:17 - 60:20)
cared about Natures you're probably not (60:18 - 60:21)
getting to the battle Tree in Sun and (60:20 - 60:24)
Moon right like it's pretty difficult if (60:21 - 60:26)
you even though let's go Pikachu let's (60:24 - 60:29)
go Eevee was a relatively (60:26 - 60:31)
um enjoyable simple straightforward game (60:29 - 60:34)
uh out of those 150 Master battles some (60:31 - 60:35)
of them were actually pretty difficult (60:34 - 60:37)
uh without just straight up looking up (60:35 - 60:39)
the puzzle right like as you could (60:37 - 60:40)
easily go like okay what's the four (60:39 - 60:41)
moves I should be using okay great I (60:40 - 60:43)
figured out the puzzle right the whole (60:41 - 60:46)
point of those Master battles were they (60:43 - 60:48)
were puzzles and once you figured it out (60:46 - 60:50)
like you cannot unfigure it out right (60:48 - 60:53)
like the thing works you put the circle (60:50 - 60:54)
in the circle hole you put the square in (60:53 - 60:56)
the square hole You you now know right (60:54 - 60:58)
like you can't undo that (60:56 - 61:00)
um (60:58 - 61:05)
I hate hate hate this this constant like (61:00 - 61:08)
Pokemon is a game for children therefore (61:05 - 61:09)
it's easy (61:08 - 61:12)
when when it's when it's not and it not (61:09 - 61:15)
only is it insulting to the majority of (61:12 - 61:18)
the player base but it's insulting to (61:15 - 61:22)
both adults and kids like there are (61:18 - 61:24)
a lot (61:22 - 61:27)
of adults that are terrible at video (61:24 - 61:30)
games and that's okay that's totally (61:27 - 61:32)
fine as I I helped a lot of them this (61:30 - 61:34)
weekend and it put a smile on my face (61:32 - 61:37)
for those people to be like I I was so (61:34 - 61:38)
Greninja is my favorite Pokemon and (61:37 - 61:40)
without your raid builds or without this (61:38 - 61:42)
community I wouldn't be able to do it (61:40 - 61:44)
like I don't care if you're bad at video (61:42 - 61:47)
games just be a nice decent person and (61:44 - 61:49)
to show up and have a good time we can (61:47 - 61:51)
get it but like (61:49 - 61:53)
to assume that like oh well kids are bad (61:51 - 61:55)
and adults are good and so everyone (61:53 - 61:57)
who's failing the raids have to be kids (61:55 - 61:58)
you're like out of your mind you're out (61:57 - 62:00)
of your mind one of my favorite moments (61:58 - 62:02)
was a parent who came in and they're (62:00 - 62:04)
like my son loves watching you it's his (62:02 - 62:06)
birthday today (62:04 - 62:08)
um can you help him do Greninja and I (62:06 - 62:11)
was like yeah cool and my twitch chat (62:08 - 62:12)
was like very like oh my gosh like I (62:11 - 62:14)
want to be in this right like they (62:12 - 62:15)
genuinely wanted it this is the kid's (62:14 - 62:18)
birthday right and they brought a (62:15 - 62:19)
gastrodon I didn't tell them what to (62:18 - 62:21)
bring I didn't ask him what level it was (62:19 - 62:23)
like I just trust that like look it (62:21 - 62:24)
doesn't matter what the level is I I'll (62:23 - 62:26)
make sure that this kid gets the (62:24 - 62:27)
Greninja right (62:26 - 62:29)
and they did everything right they (62:27 - 62:31)
started off mud slapping as soon as uh (62:29 - 62:33)
Greninja was down to negative six they (62:31 - 62:34)
started Earth powering I didn't give I (62:33 - 62:36)
didn't tell this kid what to do and I I (62:34 - 62:38)
was just shocked that like I've had to (62:36 - 62:41)
coach so many adults through these raids (62:38 - 62:43)
and like this like this seven-year-old (62:41 - 62:45)
just blew them all out of the water just (62:43 - 62:48)
an All-Star player just like kids are (62:45 - 62:50)
smart and it's just so frustrating when (62:48 - 62:52)
adults are like well everyone who's bad (62:50 - 62:54)
must be a child yeah you think when (62:52 - 62:58)
these kids are playing fortnite which (62:54 - 62:58)
a very incredibly popular game for all (62:59 - 63:04)
ages like fortnite is not a kid's game (63:02 - 63:07)
it is a game that appeals to everyone do (63:04 - 63:08)
you think that they're like fortnite is (63:07 - 63:11)
like oh we read your Biometrics you're (63:08 - 63:12)
six years old we're gonna put you (63:11 - 63:14)
against the other six-year-old no when (63:12 - 63:15)
they're playing fortnite they are (63:14 - 63:18)
playing against adults grandpas uh (63:15 - 63:21)
mothers like like there is no like age (63:18 - 63:23)
room for fortnite they were getting (63:21 - 63:25)
dropped into a player base with all ages (63:23 - 63:28)
and a lot of kids are coming out and (63:25 - 63:30)
winning (63:28 - 63:33)
um and and whatever the I don't know it (63:30 - 63:34)
says when you win in fortnite I think it (63:33 - 63:35)
says Victory Royale (63:34 - 63:38)
um like it's just crazy to me that we're (63:35 - 63:40)
still living a time where it's almost (63:38 - 63:41)
like (63:40 - 63:43)
that (63:41 - 63:44)
um (63:43 - 63:46)
I think I think my parents are (63:44 - 63:48)
theoretically Boomers (63:46 - 63:50)
um I think they follow right your mom (63:48 - 63:51)
and I are the same age (63:50 - 63:53)
my dad's older though I think my dad is (63:51 - 63:57)
Boomer oh no how much older is your dad (63:53 - 64:00)
five years no he's still an X he's still (63:57 - 64:02)
Gen X yeah but for the longest time they (64:00 - 64:03)
were like when are you gonna grow out of (64:02 - 64:04)
video games when are you going to grow (64:03 - 64:05)
out of video games and it's it feels (64:04 - 64:07)
like it's still that mentality of like (64:05 - 64:09)
well children are bad at video games (64:07 - 64:11)
like or yeah it just it's just so (64:09 - 64:14)
frustrating that I mean it speaks to the (64:11 - 64:16)
higher problem of societal expectations (64:14 - 64:21)
of acceptable pastimes right like I have (64:16 - 64:22)
started (64:21 - 64:24)
saying to people (64:22 - 64:27)
you watch football that's a kids game (64:24 - 64:29)
my nephews played that in elementary (64:27 - 64:32)
school and they begin to see like the (64:29 - 64:34)
connections like (64:32 - 64:36)
it it doesn't (64:34 - 64:41)
stop deciding how I should enjoy my time (64:36 - 64:44)
and was an acceptable use of my time it (64:41 - 64:47)
is my life I get to do these things I (64:44 - 64:50)
think the bigger thing is (64:47 - 64:53)
kids have a lot of free time yeah like (64:50 - 64:54)
they have a lot more free time than (64:53 - 64:56)
adults do (64:54 - 64:58)
um kids have a lot more can get hyper (64:56 - 65:00)
focused on things a lot more easier than (64:58 - 65:02)
adults can like (65:00 - 65:04)
they don't have as many things to be (65:02 - 65:06)
paid attention to yeah they're being (65:04 - 65:08)
pulled in so many directions provided (65:06 - 65:09)
their parents are pulling them in a (65:08 - 65:11)
million different directions (65:09 - 65:14)
um and so it is often easier for kids to (65:11 - 65:17)
be able to watch a number of things that (65:14 - 65:20)
teach them and then Implement those in (65:17 - 65:22)
practice whereas an adult we'll look up (65:20 - 65:24)
like we've said this before find a build (65:22 - 65:26)
on Google like okay I did my five (65:24 - 65:27)
minutes of research because that's all (65:26 - 65:28)
I've got time for because I have to (65:27 - 65:31)
build this thing while dinner is make (65:28 - 65:33)
cooking and they don't know how to then (65:31 - 65:37)
proceed because they just don't have a (65:33 - 65:40)
lot of time and it's it's fine yeah (65:37 - 65:43)
adults are just often (65:40 - 65:46)
discouraged from asking for help (65:43 - 65:48)
yeah like you're doing something wrong (65:46 - 65:50)
if you're asking for him yeah which is (65:48 - 65:52)
also a very frustrating thing about how (65:50 - 65:56)
Society treats adults (65:52 - 65:56)
yeah (65:56 - 65:59)
um (65:58 - 66:02)
I I think I think that the Greninja and (65:59 - 66:04)
the cinderace and the Charizard I think (66:02 - 66:06)
they are the right level of difficulty (66:04 - 66:09)
uh just like I think that Destiny raids (66:06 - 66:11)
were the right level of difficulty right (66:09 - 66:12)
like (66:11 - 66:15)
if you had six people in a destiny raid (66:12 - 66:16)
and everyone knew what they were doing (66:15 - 66:18)
you would probably maybe wipe once but (66:16 - 66:19)
you would get the whole raid done in (66:18 - 66:21)
like 45 minutes Destiny Reds were kind (66:19 - 66:22)
of long (66:21 - 66:24)
but you know if you had two new people (66:22 - 66:26)
and they were struggling and they their (66:24 - 66:28)
gun play wasn't as good or their you (66:26 - 66:30)
know their reaction time wasn't as great (66:28 - 66:31)
you'd be there for like three four hours (66:30 - 66:33)
you'd be there longer (66:31 - 66:37)
um and that was also okay like like the (66:33 - 66:39)
joy for me wasn't like if I wanted to (66:37 - 66:41)
get done as fast as possible I wouldn't (66:39 - 66:42)
be playing with those people right I (66:41 - 66:45)
would I would right I would go to lfg (66:42 - 66:46)
looking for a group and I would post (66:45 - 66:49)
like must-have experience you know on a (66:46 - 66:51)
time limit you know and people would (66:49 - 66:52)
show because other people would be like (66:51 - 66:54)
I also want experience also on a time (66:52 - 66:57)
limit I will join this and no there will (66:54 - 66:59)
be no no cigarette break like most adult (66:57 - 67:03)
raids have is like oh hold on yeah (66:59 - 67:07)
um but like it's bio time everybody bio (67:03 - 67:11)
break bio break uh but you know I had a (67:07 - 67:13)
lot of good memories sitting in a (67:11 - 67:15)
destiny raid for three four hours which (67:13 - 67:17)
is way more than you should be but (67:15 - 67:19)
because like it was the joy of getting (67:17 - 67:21)
those two or three new people like the (67:19 - 67:23)
first clear they've ever gotten and to (67:21 - 67:26)
hear them so excited was like okay that (67:23 - 67:28)
was worth the three hours because yeah I (67:26 - 67:30)
mean they did it there are things I (67:28 - 67:32)
can't go back to right like the wow 40 (67:30 - 67:34)
mans that you had to do over over (67:32 - 67:36)
multiple days and you had to leave your (67:34 - 67:37)
character (67:36 - 67:40)
in the raid because it if you left it (67:37 - 67:41)
would reset (67:40 - 67:45)
so you'd spend yeah with a multi-day (67:41 - 67:47)
because of big people or because of (67:45 - 67:50)
because it was so hard so you could get (67:47 - 67:52)
you would get halfway through and be (67:50 - 67:53)
like okay well that's five hours we have (67:52 - 67:57)
to stop we'll come back Thursday so (67:53 - 67:59)
everybody stay here just log your (67:57 - 68:01)
character out in this safe Alcove (67:59 - 68:04)
uh you couldn't play until the next (68:01 - 68:06)
thing which was usually Friday so you do (68:04 - 68:08)
it on Tuesday you'd not play the game (68:06 - 68:10)
you'd log in on Friday to complete the (68:08 - 68:12)
rest of the raid (68:10 - 68:14)
um because it was that and it was 40 (68:12 - 68:16)
people so you had to have 40 people all (68:14 - 68:17)
agree (68:16 - 68:19)
this is what we're doing for these two (68:17 - 68:22)
days that's so much coordination and at (68:19 - 68:23)
the time it was like this is the only (68:22 - 68:27)
option we have sure this is fun like (68:23 - 68:29)
none of us liked it but what else can we (68:27 - 68:32)
do and like when they brought back (68:29 - 68:35)
vanilla wow and people were like I can't (68:32 - 68:37)
wait to I'm like no I am never going (68:35 - 68:39)
back to that I am never going back to (68:37 - 68:42)
logging out halfway through (68:39 - 68:45)
not people had alts to do the other days (68:42 - 68:48)
like well I guess I'm leveling my alt (68:45 - 68:51)
because I got I can't I can't leave (68:48 - 68:53)
and you couldn't go back in like if you (68:51 - 68:55)
left and people stayed in so it didn't (68:53 - 68:58)
reset all the all of the mobs would (68:55 - 69:01)
respawn so you couldn't get back to the (68:59 - 69:03)
group (69:01 - 69:06)
you could never get back so you had to (69:03 - 69:07)
stay where they were because you you (69:06 - 69:09)
would be killed on the way trying to get (69:08 - 69:12)
to people nightmare (69:09 - 69:14)
but if one person left it would ruin it (69:12 - 69:16)
for everyone right no as long as one (69:14 - 69:19)
person stayed (69:16 - 69:22)
at at that time they had as long as some (69:19 - 69:25)
members said and it was a warlock that (69:22 - 69:27)
stayed a warlock had opened portals to (69:25 - 69:30)
summon people from the entrance of the (69:27 - 69:32)
dungeon so if what but the problem is is (69:30 - 69:34)
the Warlock portal summoning only worked (69:32 - 69:36)
with three people you had to have the (69:34 - 69:37)
Warlock and then two people to click on (69:36 - 69:40)
it to summon so at minimum we had to (69:37 - 69:42)
have a warlock three people and the (69:40 - 69:45)
Warlock had to use up bag space to have (69:42 - 69:49)
enough Soul shards to summon 39 people (69:45 - 69:54)
nightmare so awful so awful (69:49 - 69:57)
speaking of nightmares this is off (69:54 - 69:59)
kataku Fish Place Pokemon scarlet and (69:57 - 70:02)
violet accidentally commits credit card (69:59 - 70:03)
fraud (70:02 - 70:05)
foreign (70:03 - 70:05)
a YouTuber created an alternative switch (70:06 - 70:11)
an alternative switch controller for (70:09 - 70:13)
their pet fish which allowed them to (70:11 - 70:14)
play the video game on the live stream (70:13 - 70:17)
this isn't new by the way like we've had (70:14 - 70:20)
years old video games for quite a while (70:17 - 70:22)
that fish managed to spend real money on (70:20 - 70:24)
some digital purchases while trying to (70:22 - 70:26)
beat a gym leader in Pokemon scarlet and (70:24 - 70:28)
violet this happened because Carl and (70:26 - 70:30)
violet was so buggy that the game (70:28 - 70:32)
crashed to the home menu (70:30 - 70:36)
uh the popular Japanese YouTuber uh meti (70:32 - 70:39)
Muti Kimi Rue (70:36 - 70:40)
um we'll have the article in the show (70:39 - 70:43)
notes if you want to click through it (70:40 - 70:46)
who streams fish playing video games via (70:43 - 70:50)
an assistive device uh was intending to (70:46 - 70:51)
help a viewer stay home during the (70:50 - 70:53)
pandemic the fish will swim over certain (70:51 - 70:56)
areas of the controller and then the (70:53 - 70:59)
game will register a specific input (70:56 - 71:01)
um and the fish plays you know multiple (70:59 - 71:04)
video games it's not just Pokemon (71:01 - 71:07)
uh (71:04 - 71:07)
so (71:07 - 71:11)
pretty boring story of just fish playing (71:09 - 71:15)
Pokemon but because of the game (71:11 - 71:19)
uh then it backed out to the home menu (71:15 - 71:22)
where the fish then added 500 yen to the (71:19 - 71:26)
owner's account then use the resulting (71:22 - 71:28)
then it used the resulting Nintendo gold (71:26 - 71:31)
coins which are the Loyalty coins to buy (71:28 - 71:33)
a golf cosmetic for Nintendo switch (71:31 - 71:36)
Sports (71:33 - 71:36)
um (71:38 - 71:41)
and a game right (71:38 - 71:43)
I don't know if it bought anything else (71:41 - 71:46)
here (71:43 - 71:46)
uh but the fish did go back to the home (71:46 - 71:51)
page managed to open the eShop it did (71:49 - 71:53)
show the credit card information stored (71:51 - 71:55)
which the owner now has to get a new (71:53 - 71:57)
credit card yeah (71:55 - 72:00)
um I downloaded the Nintendo switch 64 (71:57 - 72:03)
Nintendo 64 emulator (72:00 - 72:05)
I feel like (72:03 - 72:07)
this is the dumb thing I would do (72:05 - 72:09)
because I would also forget to take my (72:07 - 72:11)
saved information out (72:09 - 72:13)
assuming like what could possibly go (72:11 - 72:15)
like not thinking through those steps (72:13 - 72:19)
like what if it goes wrong because why (72:15 - 72:21)
would a hyper buggy game that crashes a (72:19 - 72:23)
lot crash and that my fish have free (72:21 - 72:25)
access to my personal data like that is (72:23 - 72:27)
not a that is not a thing that I would (72:25 - 72:28)
think about that is something my husband (72:27 - 72:31)
would think about however he would way (72:28 - 72:33)
go down that that's why I run ideas past (72:31 - 72:35)
it because he's he's got much more of (72:33 - 72:38)
the anxiety plot line than I do I'm much (72:35 - 72:40)
more of a what could go wrong let's do (72:38 - 72:44)
it I'm still at multiple crashes on my (72:40 - 72:46)
game like I I still get like like one to (72:44 - 72:49)
two crashes a week yep I still have not (72:46 - 72:51)
crashed once don't know what the (72:49 - 72:52)
difference is there you got the golden (72:51 - 72:54)
code over there (72:52 - 72:55)
hahaha (72:54 - 72:57)
it's like Willy Wonka you got the golden (72:55 - 72:59)
you got the golden version oh these six (72:57 - 73:01)
people in the country can play a (72:59 - 73:04)
bug-free game later you get to go tour (73:01 - 73:06)
Nintendo Land we get turned into a (73:04 - 73:07)
Goomba (73:06 - 73:10)
I want to go I I would be up to Nintendo (73:07 - 73:12)
Land I did um (73:10 - 73:15)
but I feel like this uh (73:12 - 73:17)
I don't know if it's mute kimaru or (73:15 - 73:20)
mutakimaru channel one of those they've (73:17 - 73:22)
been playing these for a long time for (73:20 - 73:24)
years and if this has never happened (73:22 - 73:26)
before this means that this is the most (73:24 - 73:30)
buggy of all the games potentially that (73:26 - 73:33)
these fish have played (73:30 - 73:33)
which is saying something yeah (73:33 - 73:38)
yeah and those fish they have a lot of (73:38 - 73:44)
fish content on their YouTube (73:41 - 73:46)
it's all fish all the way down I feel (73:44 - 73:48)
like we probably stemmed from Twitch (73:46 - 73:51)
Plays Pokemon initially yes I believe it (73:48 - 73:53)
did yeah here's what you do is you get a (73:51 - 73:56)
turtle uh-huh and then you sit up to (73:53 - 73:57)
Turtle plays Pokemon for the days that (73:56 - 73:59)
you don't want to stream (73:57 - 74:02)
I see turtles are stinky though aren't (73:59 - 74:03)
they (74:02 - 74:05)
that is if they're in the water if (74:03 - 74:07)
they're aquatic turtles you're not gonna (74:05 - 74:08)
smell them (74:07 - 74:11)
but everything's stinky fish are stinky (74:08 - 74:12)
these are sticky aren't they yeah (74:11 - 74:16)
everything's sticky sticky we are just (74:12 - 74:20)
the only species that actively takes (74:16 - 74:20)
just (74:20 - 74:23)
beyond the levels of care to make us (74:21 - 74:25)
less stinky (74:23 - 74:28)
I'm waiting for cat deodorant (74:25 - 74:30)
good luck (74:28 - 74:33)
I think that's a million dollar idea (74:30 - 74:35)
right there I think I think I think (74:33 - 74:37)
that's our show (74:35 - 74:40)
that's also the secret phrase if you've (74:37 - 74:42)
made it to the end go to Twitch is that (74:40 - 74:44)
cat deodorant and watch chaos ensue (74:42 - 74:46)
perfect (74:44 - 74:48)
um if you missed Greninja if you didn't (74:46 - 74:50)
have time I think that's also a big (74:48 - 74:51)
factor here is just people don't have (74:50 - 74:55)
time uh you got another two weeks yeah (74:51 - 74:57)
not this coming week but next week to (74:55 - 74:58)

Pokemon come over to Twitch we'll help (75:03 - 75:07)
