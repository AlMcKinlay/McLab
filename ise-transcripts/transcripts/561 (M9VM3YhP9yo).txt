561st episode of the Pokemon podcast (0:27 - 0:32)
it's super effective there are too many (0:30 - 0:35)
episodes I'm your host Steve with me is (0:32 - 0:39)
Greg you're just realizing now that (0:35 - 0:42)
there are too many episodes in 40 weeks (0:39 - 0:44)
in theory unless we drag it out it'll be (0:42 - 0:48)
Episode 600 and we need to do something (0:44 - 0:52)
that's a year less than a year 40 weeks (0:48 - 0:54)
unless we do the (0:52 - 0:58)
599.7 garbage (0:54 - 0:58)
like also uh I mean podcast has existed (1:00 - 1:09)
for like 10 12 years so 120 (1:04 - 1:11)
yeah yeah I've been playing this I've (1:09 - 1:13)
been doing this podcast since I was a (1:11 - 1:15)
child (1:13 - 1:18)
Hannah Hannah also here that Hannah has (1:15 - 1:20)
not been here for 500 episodes though no (1:18 - 1:22)
I definitely have not been but I've been (1:20 - 1:25)
here for more than it feels like (1:22 - 1:28)
um yeah I keep realizing how quickly (1:25 - 1:30)
that number is going up (1:28 - 1:33)
but no I am just exhausted from (1:30 - 1:35)
yesterday's Community Day which was (1:33 - 1:36)
absolutely wonderful but it wasn't (1:35 - 1:39)
because of Pokemon go it was because of (1:36 - 1:42)
the community yeah (1:39 - 1:42)
Niantic gave us bad weather so we had to (1:44 - 1:49)
go too oh Mall of America we actually (1:46 - 1:50)
had a really good day yesterday here (1:49 - 1:52)
yeah it's cold and then it snowed (1:50 - 1:55)
another snow again after it was yes (1:52 - 2:00)
three days ago 84 degrees (1:55 - 2:00)
snow on the ground there's snow on the (2:00 - 2:04)
ground but luckily it's not on the (2:03 - 2:08)
sidewalks so I don't have to shovel (2:04 - 2:11)
uh okay so for today's show we have some (2:08 - 2:14)
master stuff we have some unite stuff uh (2:11 - 2:16)

Typhlosion raids happened uh there's a (2:16 - 2:20)
new Pokemon showing off in the anime (2:18 - 2:23)
that they want us to care about but at (2:20 - 2:25)
the same time they haven't even finished (2:23 - 2:28)
the other anime in the United States (2:25 - 2:30)
very confusing (2:28 - 2:31)
um (2:30 - 2:34)
so I guess uh I guess we'll just start (2:31 - 2:35)
off with the (2:34 - 2:38)
Pokemon Masters news we haven't talked (2:35 - 2:40)
about Masters in like two or three weeks (2:38 - 2:43)

Shada and cleft key no yeah oh is this a (3:19 - 3:24)
continuation this is this is part two of (3:22 - 3:27)
the mystery event (3:24 - 3:29)
that started with Steve and Scotland and (3:27 - 3:31)
Shauna and klefky so there's a murder (3:29 - 3:34)
mystery party happening on paizo (3:31 - 3:38)
nobody yeah it's I think's not stolen (3:34 - 3:40)
anyways it's like a murder mystery (3:38 - 3:42)
partner where everybody has a role and (3:40 - 3:43)
everybody's pretending to be somebody (3:42 - 3:46)
else and the big drama I'm gonna spoil (3:43 - 3:50)
part of the drama the minute you start (3:46 - 3:52)
Locker doesn't get to be the detective (3:50 - 3:56)
and looker is very upset about it oh (3:52 - 3:57)
wait (3:56 - 4:00)
does it look is liquor a sink bear (3:57 - 4:03)
looker a pro gunk oh yeah one of the (4:00 - 4:05)
biggest one of the strongest sync pairs (4:03 - 4:08)
in the game is liquor and Grogan (4:05 - 4:12)
yes my uh my Master's icon right now is (4:08 - 4:15)
detective Stephen Stone yeah detective (4:12 - 4:17)
Stephen Stone and assistant Shauna had (4:15 - 4:19)
to solve a mystery and the Mystery does (4:17 - 4:22)
not get solved in part one who knew when (4:19 - 4:24)
they say it's part one that that would (4:22 - 4:26)
continue into a part two (4:24 - 4:29)
well it seems like part two uh or at (4:26 - 4:32)
least Lyra and Zinnia are available (4:29 - 4:36)
until May 1st so you have about two (4:32 - 4:38)
weeks (4:36 - 4:38)
the (4:38 - 4:45)
it says uh Lyra and her trusty fancy are (4:40 - 4:47)
support the ground type support sync (4:45 - 4:49)
pair doesn't dish out much damage but (4:47 - 4:51)
they can take a punch thanks to defense (4:49 - 4:55)
boost and type resistance (4:51 - 4:55)
and they oh pokemon.com is recommending (4:56 - 5:03)
that you pair hapu and mudsdale that's (4:59 - 5:05)
been in the game since like literally (5:03 - 5:09)
what like month one uh and then Courtney (5:05 - 5:11)
and Camera okay camerupt (5:09 - 5:14)
and then (5:11 - 5:14)
they got uh Zinnia and thieval which is (5:15 - 5:21)
a dark type (5:19 - 5:24)
sync pair dealing damage that can lower (5:21 - 5:28)
dark type rebuff of their opponent I (5:24 - 5:33)
don't know what team rebuff down means (5:28 - 5:36)
I'm the the battling of Masters has (5:33 - 5:37)
always eluded me I was I just like (5:36 - 5:40)
pressing the buttons and then getting (5:37 - 5:43)
the success collecting the characters (5:40 - 5:45)
uh they recommend pairing this with the (5:43 - 5:48)
master Rail and incineroar and hop and (5:45 - 5:50)
zamazunta (5:48 - 5:52)
unfortunately in this press release it (5:50 - 5:55)
still does not actually tell us Who the (5:52 - 5:58)
Master Royal is no that is the real (5:55 - 6:00)
mystery is that part three industry well (5:58 - 6:02)
they fixed the bug where you couldn't (6:00 - 6:05)
have Kukui and The Mask Royal on the (6:02 - 6:07)
same team (6:05 - 6:09)
so thankfully in the last patch they (6:07 - 6:12)
fixed that bug so now they finally (6:09 - 6:15)
fix that whole (6:12 - 6:19)
chaos and uh (6:15 - 6:21)
uh again so now you know for sure (6:19 - 6:24)
yeah well they're two of my favorite (6:21 - 6:26)
characters from alola so I want them on (6:24 - 6:28)
the same team (6:26 - 6:28)
why would you not (6:29 - 6:32)
uh did they add any new people to the uh (6:32 - 6:38)
what do they call it the the resort the (6:35 - 6:39)
lounge yeah the trainers launched uh (6:38 - 6:41)
Steven Stone is now in the trainers (6:39 - 6:44)
Lounge uh (6:41 - 6:46)
uh they've added a couple I think we've (6:44 - 6:47)
talked about all of them but Steven (6:46 - 6:49)
Stone is the most recent (6:47 - 6:53)
uh smoocher coming to the (6:49 - 6:55)
coming to the lodge (6:53 - 6:58)
uh (6:55 - 7:00)
yeah rebuff and mitigation are two very (6:58 - 7:05)
confusing aspects of how (7:00 - 7:07)
Masters works (7:05 - 7:09)
uh (7:07 - 7:11)
and really only if you're playing at (7:09 - 7:13)
high levels do you care like they pair (7:11 - 7:15)
it with dark things because in theory (7:13 - 7:18)
when you're lowering it they become more (7:15 - 7:21)
susceptible to dark types is a real (7:18 - 7:23)
rough way of saying that's what that is (7:21 - 7:26)
it's more complicated than that but yeah (7:23 - 7:28)
basically (7:26 - 7:32)
the more you can you can debuff or (7:28 - 7:34)
rebuff whatever they use them so that (7:32 - 7:37)
they're weaker to dark types kind of (7:34 - 7:39)
it's it's (7:37 - 7:42)
it's internal logic don't worry about it (7:39 - 7:44)
just stick with the Sig pairs that they (7:42 - 7:47)
have and you'll be fine (7:44 - 7:47)
look I'm not the the biggest fan of the (7:47 - 7:51)
the Masters battle system but I know the (7:49 - 7:53)
people who like it they absolutely love (7:51 - 7:57)
it yes they're very into their (7:53 - 8:00)
Mega Man sync grid thing that they gotta (7:57 - 8:02)
do in the (8:00 - 8:04)
I I remember it really seems very (8:02 - 8:09)
thoroughly thought out it is uh it is (8:04 - 8:13)
well pieced together and the sink grid (8:09 - 8:15)
does actually give you a lot of control (8:13 - 8:18)
over how that unit interacts with other (8:15 - 8:22)
ones so like if you're at the high level (8:18 - 8:25)
of the game it is really (8:22 - 8:27)
great in the fact that if you like (8:25 - 8:29)
getting into the number crunchy stuff (8:27 - 8:31)
you could say no I need this person to (8:29 - 8:34)
be you know of uh I want there when I do (8:31 - 8:36)
their sync pair I want it to be Max (8:34 - 8:38)
damage match crit do all everything that (8:36 - 8:43)
it can be so you can build them that way (8:38 - 8:46)
if you want but since you can refund to (8:43 - 8:48)
all of your sync grid stuff like if you (8:46 - 8:50)
need to do something else you can refund (8:48 - 8:52)
and rebuild it a different way like I (8:50 - 8:53)
have an entire spreadsheet that people (8:52 - 8:55)
put together where you can go to actual (8:53 - 8:57)
bills depending what you need like it's (8:55 - 9:00)
pretty wild how deep that game goes (8:57 - 9:03)
it's also great that you never have to (9:00 - 9:04)
pay attention to it if you don't want to (9:03 - 9:06)
if you never want to do the hard stuff (9:04 - 9:08)
you don't ever have to and it's just (9:06 - 9:11)
there as a thing that you can do and (9:08 - 9:13)
since they added in seeing other (9:11 - 9:15)
people's teams that work that also (9:13 - 9:17)
include their sync grid builds you can (9:15 - 9:18)
just pick somebody else's team and say (9:17 - 9:21)
use all that it will build that the way (9:18 - 9:23)
they built it and you really don't have (9:21 - 9:25)
to worry about it anymore (9:23 - 9:26)
they've done a lot of really great (9:25 - 9:28)
things to make Masters much more (9:26 - 9:31)
playable than it was when they first (9:28 - 9:32)
said hi we made a bad game so we're (9:31 - 9:35)
gonna fix it (9:32 - 9:36)
well people were like really into the (9:35 - 9:38)
co-op when it came out and then they (9:36 - 9:39)
just like dropped that they were like (9:38 - 9:41)
now we're gonna refocus on this (9:39 - 9:44)
yeah they drop Co-op completely did you (9:41 - 9:46)
get co-op events like (9:44 - 9:48)
once every three months I think and then (9:46 - 9:51)
Co-op and Masters is like the footprints (9:48 - 9:54)
in Pokemon go like there there are there (9:51 - 9:56)
are like a couple people that are so (9:54 - 9:58)
passionate about the co-op and Masters (9:56 - 9:59)
and it's like I don't think it's ever (9:58 - 10:02)
come just like the footsteps like like (9:59 - 10:04)
first off that game was so broken the (10:02 - 10:06)
first week it came out they're like five (10:04 - 10:09)
people were able to experience the (10:06 - 10:11)
footsteps and those five people never (10:09 - 10:14)
they will never forget the footsteps it (10:11 - 10:16)
was so good (10:14 - 10:19)
you could actually it was like you were (10:16 - 10:20)
finding the Pokemon you didn't know (10:19 - 10:22)
where to go for it but you were looking (10:20 - 10:24)
around for it it was so remember was it (10:22 - 10:26)
like three footsteps were like yeah (10:24 - 10:29)
farther away and then one footstep was (10:26 - 10:33)
closer yeah yep and I mean you were (10:29 - 10:35)
literally like (10:33 - 10:37)
staring at your phone walking into (10:35 - 10:38)
traffic to see if you were getting (10:37 - 10:40)
closer further away it was one of the (10:38 - 10:42)
most deadly things they added that (10:40 - 10:44)
didn't really work either it was like (10:42 - 10:45)
playing hot and cold you're getting it (10:44 - 10:47)
yeah you're getting colder it was so (10:45 - 10:50)
good playing hot and cold with your life (10:47 - 10:52)
on the line no I'm gonna walk into (10:50 - 10:55)
traffic to see if I get one step closer (10:52 - 10:57)
or not (10:55 - 10:59)
and then you get to the other side of (10:57 - 11:00)
the street and it's like oh I'm farther (10:59 - 11:03)
away okay well I'm gonna weave back (11:00 - 11:07)
through traffic everybody stop please (11:03 - 11:07)
um yeah (11:09 - 11:15)
uh are we on our fourth anniversary of (11:10 - 11:18)
Masters this summer yeah we're at 3.5 (11:15 - 11:22)
right now yeah yeah so so it should be (11:18 - 11:25)
four in is it October it's always in (11:22 - 11:27)
August August I think September because (11:25 - 11:31)
uh unite is in August and then Masters (11:27 - 11:33)
in September speaking of Unite (11:31 - 11:36)
uh they added probably one of the most (11:33 - 11:38)
wild characters (11:36 - 11:41)
to Pokemon Unite (11:38 - 11:44)
I mean I love it it's I don't I don't (11:41 - 11:45)
know where where they were on the (11:44 - 11:47)
drawing board of like (11:45 - 11:49)
let's get a Pokemon that other Pokemon (11:47 - 11:54)
can jump onto uh but (11:49 - 11:54)
very very into this uh Lapras is now (11:54 - 12:00)
available in Pokemon unite the (11:57 - 12:03)
uh transport your teammates to Victory (12:00 - 12:05)
with Lapras in Pokemon unite this water (12:03 - 12:07)
and ice type Pokemon from the Kanto (12:05 - 12:08)
region loves being at the center of (12:07 - 12:10)
attention giving it teammate giving the (12:08 - 12:12)
teammates a rider to (12:10 - 12:15)
um and disrupting uh opposition with a (12:12 - 12:17)
chilling Ice Beam you can obtain Lapras (12:15 - 12:22)
for 1200 EOS coins or 575 EOS gems (12:17 - 12:25)
Lapras will be only obviously for seven (12:22 - 12:28)
days you can only use coins or sorry gem (12:25 - 12:30)
gems (12:28 - 12:32)
um (12:30 - 12:35)
it has Whirlpool ice Shard waterfalls (12:32 - 12:37)
parasong bubble beam ice beam and then (12:35 - 12:40)
the unite move is called Lapras Express (12:37 - 12:42)
Lapras rides a wave quickly and (12:40 - 12:45)
continuously forward lapras's movement (12:42 - 12:48)
speed increases while riding but (12:45 - 12:50)
decreases if Lapras is hit by an (12:48 - 12:52)
obstacle if Lapras hits an opposing (12:50 - 12:54)
Pokemon Lapras will stop in place deal (12:52 - 12:57)
damage and throw uh deal damage and (12:54 - 13:00)
throwing the opposing Pokemon while (12:57 - 13:04)
Lapras is riding that wave uh one nearby (13:00 - 13:08)
Ally of lapras's choice yeah you do not (13:04 - 13:11)
get a choice it's lapras's choice not (13:08 - 13:12)
anyone else's choice not anybody else (13:11 - 13:15)
that's amazing uh one nearby Ally of (13:12 - 13:17)
lapras's choice can ride on its back if (13:15 - 13:20)
Lapras expressed is used again Lapras (13:17 - 13:22)
stops launches a wave and continues (13:20 - 13:24)
moving forward dealing damage to (13:22 - 13:26)
opposing Pokemon it hits and throwing (13:24 - 13:29)
them Ally Pokemon riding on Lapras (13:26 - 13:33)
lapras's back can Dismount whenever they (13:29 - 13:36)
choose sure sure you can this this has (13:33 - 13:39)
happened to me I've been I was playing (13:36 - 13:42)
with a Lapras (13:39 - 13:45)
shooting away and suddenly I was moving (13:42 - 13:48)
at five million miles an hour by the (13:45 - 13:49)
time I figured out what had just (13:48 - 13:51)
happened I'd we'd already stopped and (13:49 - 13:53)
I've been thrown off like you can choose (13:51 - 13:57)
sure sure you can literally had like I (13:53 - 13:59)
even knew that that's what the unite (13:57 - 14:02)
move did and suddenly I was just picked (13:59 - 14:04)
up I had no choice (14:02 - 14:08)
zipped halfway across the world (14:04 - 14:08)
like does libraries have to be like (14:08 - 14:12)
pretty on you or you have to be pretty (14:10 - 14:14)
close it's within like when you see it's (14:12 - 14:17)
Whirlpool that's roughly the oh okay (14:14 - 14:20)
area of where it pulls from (14:17 - 14:23)
um but yeah just sucked up (14:20 - 14:25)
didn't have a say in the matter (14:23 - 14:28)
over here thanks for making that choice (14:25 - 14:30)
for me but (14:28 - 14:32)
it's also just weird seeing it because (14:30 - 14:34)
it moves pretty like all Defenders move (14:32 - 14:37)
slowly pretty slowly as they move across (14:34 - 14:39)
it's just kind of like floating around (14:37 - 14:41)
vibing and then suddenly it's like (14:39 - 14:45)
gotta go I'm just gonna sail across the (14:41 - 14:48)
screen there it goes everybody (14:45 - 14:50)
I've yet to see the actual train happen (14:48 - 14:52)
because I know as it passes (14:50 - 14:55)
other people can choose to join into the (14:52 - 14:57)
train I just have not seen that happen (14:55 - 15:00)
yet (14:57 - 15:02)
okay I I have I have two questions here (15:00 - 15:05)
don't know if you can answer them maybe (15:02 - 15:08)
just one question okay so I I saw a (15:05 - 15:12)
video of Lapras surfing around using (15:08 - 15:14)
unite move and there was a cramerant on (15:12 - 15:16)
lapras's back and cam cramerant was (15:14 - 15:19)
using his unite on lapras's unite yeah (15:16 - 15:21)
and it was amazing because it was like (15:19 - 15:23)
picking up a Gatling gun and being like (15:21 - 15:26)
we can finally move you around yes so I (15:23 - 15:29)
was like I'm sold I I want to I want I I (15:26 - 15:31)
need I need a best friend out there that (15:29 - 15:33)
wants to play Lapras and I want to be (15:31 - 15:36)
able to I want I want to say goodnight (15:33 - 15:37)
to you every morning I want to text you (15:36 - 15:39)
good morning I want I want to be best (15:37 - 15:40)
for I want to get lunch with you every (15:39 - 15:42)
day and then I want to play unite every (15:40 - 15:44)
single night but you have to be live for (15:42 - 15:46)
us I have to be Kramer and I want that (15:44 - 15:48)
scenario to happen now in my life yep I (15:46 - 15:50)
didn't know that they would add a (15:48 - 15:52)
Pokemon I didn't care about (15:50 - 15:54)
to then affect a Pokemon I do care about (15:52 - 15:56)
so greatly (15:54 - 15:58)
the the ultimate marketing really (15:56 - 16:00)
honestly uh the actual question I have (15:58 - 16:03)
here is if I'm cramerant and I'm on top (16:00 - 16:07)
of Lapras can comfy go around lapras's (16:03 - 16:09)
neck at the same time and like feel it (16:07 - 16:12)
because they're different attachments so (16:09 - 16:16)
comfy has attached to Lapras (16:12 - 16:17)
now we don't know how many of these (16:16 - 16:20)
things are weird bugs and interactions (16:17 - 16:22)
like we don't know if (16:20 - 16:25)
we don't know if crime rap being able to (16:22 - 16:28)
unite on the back of laparosis unite is (16:25 - 16:31)
working as intended or we never thought (16:28 - 16:33)
anybody would do this and we didn't plan (16:31 - 16:36)
for IT thing but from what I've seen you (16:33 - 16:39)
can confide can be around Lapras and (16:36 - 16:42)
Lapras can be carrying somebody again we (16:39 - 16:44)
don't know if these interactions are (16:42 - 16:46)
supposed to happen this way we have no (16:44 - 16:50)
clue if this is what they wanted to do (16:46 - 16:54)
or if it's just people are doing it do (16:50 - 16:56)
you got to play it while you can do you (16:54 - 16:58)
think Lapras makes the game better in (16:56 - 17:01)
the sense of like rotation when people (16:58 - 17:03)
are like hey let's rotate to the bottom (17:01 - 17:07)
lappers can just be like I'm taking you (17:03 - 17:10)
to that yeah I mean late game to get (17:07 - 17:12)
from top to bottom and late game to go (17:10 - 17:15)
from a team fight straight to Rey Lapras (17:12 - 17:17)
is amazing because they can pull people (17:15 - 17:20)
there and those people as far as as far (17:17 - 17:23)
as we can tell people on its back much (17:20 - 17:25)
like when cone face around aren't (17:23 - 17:27)
targetable (17:25 - 17:30)
um granted it's not a very long ride (17:27 - 17:31)
right like (17:30 - 17:35)
it only goes so far but as far as I can (17:31 - 17:38)
tell and you know it's only been out (17:35 - 17:41)
about four days at this point (17:38 - 17:42)
um (17:41 - 17:47)
yeah you're like you can go from your (17:42 - 17:49)
goal everybody you know healing at your (17:47 - 17:52)
goal straight to Rey in about a second (17:49 - 17:55)
you can go from top to bottom in about (17:52 - 17:58)
two seconds if and since it can seems to (17:55 - 18:00)
be able to train people like if (17:58 - 18:01)
everybody's up there it needs to go down (18:00 - 18:04)
you can all ZIP down (18:01 - 18:07)
um at the cost of wasting somebody's (18:04 - 18:08)
unite move (18:07 - 18:12)
I mean wasting uh if the goal is just to (18:08 - 18:13)
get people around it's not wasted but (18:12 - 18:15)
you don't get any you don't you don't do (18:13 - 18:17)
the damage at the end if there's nobody (18:15 - 18:20)
down there to damage I would assume that (18:17 - 18:22)
lapis gets its unite move more quickly (18:20 - 18:24)
than others because it's just a (18:22 - 18:27)
transportation it's it was a (18:24 - 18:29)
transportation and damage when it stops (18:27 - 18:32)
it sends out a wave that damages and (18:29 - 18:34)
throws Pokemon around and if it hits a (18:32 - 18:36)
Pokemon it does damage so there is a (18:34 - 18:39)
damage component to it (18:36 - 18:40)
um it definitely doesn't get as fast as (18:39 - 18:42)
Dragon pulp does I haven't I haven't (18:40 - 18:44)
purchased because I don't have gems I'm (18:42 - 18:45)
not paying gems for Lapras so I haven't (18:44 - 18:48)
actually seen the the timer countdown (18:45 - 18:52)
but there are things now to be able to (18:48 - 18:54)
more quickly get you your knight move (18:52 - 18:56)
back so I think some builds have that (18:54 - 18:59)
for transport people are still figuring (18:56 - 19:00)
out (18:59 - 19:03)
the best way to play Lapras but so far (19:00 - 19:05)
pretty much everybody's like parasong is (19:03 - 19:07)
the way to go (19:05 - 19:09)
um and then I've mostly been seeing (19:07 - 19:11)
people use Ice Beam (19:09 - 19:14)
um because it freezes them it's a pretty (19:11 - 19:15)
good trap (19:14 - 19:18)
uh and parisong is just (19:15 - 19:21)
super a super strong AOE especially when (19:18 - 19:23)
it gets boosted up (19:21 - 19:23)
um (19:23 - 19:27)
so that's what I've seen so far uh we (19:23 - 19:29)
don't know if the people if cram right (19:27 - 19:31)
on the back of Lapras being a Gatling (19:29 - 19:34)
gun zipping around the field is intended (19:31 - 19:36)
but I have seen it happen a couple of (19:34 - 19:38)
times the first time it happened I'm (19:36 - 19:40)
like (19:38 - 19:40)
what is happening right now (19:43 - 19:47)
Hannah does Lapras make you want to ride (19:47 - 19:54)
back into Unite a little bit I mean (19:50 - 19:56)
yeah definitely a little bit I haven't (19:54 - 19:58)
played unite all that much and I (19:56 - 20:01)
probably wouldn't play as Lapras both (19:58 - 20:03)
because I'm not spending money on that (20:01 - 20:05)
game and because (20:03 - 20:08)
I don't think that I am good enough at (20:05 - 20:10)
that game for that but it sounds like it (20:08 - 20:13)
could be fun to play with someone (20:10 - 20:13)
yeah Gumi and Lapras have been on in (20:13 - 20:18)
pretty much every team that I've two (20:16 - 20:20)
Defenders no reason for it but (20:18 - 20:21)
everyone's played Goomy and everyone (20:20 - 20:22)
wants to play Lapras right now because (20:21 - 20:24)
they're new (20:22 - 20:27)
uh speaking of new uh there are a couple (20:24 - 20:29)
Pokemon on the public test server that (20:27 - 20:30)
are (20:29 - 20:32)
in the works of coming out Greg do you (20:30 - 20:34)
want to talk about those upcoming (20:32 - 20:36)
Pokemon yeah so the next two Pokemon (20:34 - 20:38)
that we know are coming are Chandelure (20:36 - 20:40)
and Umbreon (20:38 - 20:43)
um I don't know the exact release of (20:40 - 20:46)
which is coming first uh (20:43 - 20:48)
Umbreon seems to be a def uh another (20:46 - 20:51)
sort of Defender type uh and Chandler (20:48 - 20:54)
seems to be an attacker (20:51 - 20:55)
um (20:54 - 20:58)
uh more importantly does Litwick look (20:55 - 21:00)
amazing when it's scooting across the (20:58 - 21:04)
field it does it looks (21:00 - 21:04)
Umbreon looks you know just like all the (21:06 - 21:09)
EVS like (21:08 - 21:12)
we're pretty we're pretty used to that (21:09 - 21:15)
uh how many Evolutions are left (21:12 - 21:18)
so I think just the Kanto ones right (21:15 - 21:21)
yeah so well so we we won't talk about (21:18 - 21:23)
the rumored one (21:21 - 21:25)
um but after I'm brand there will be (21:23 - 21:29)
Flareon Jolteon Vaporeon and Leafeon (21:25 - 21:32)
left got it um and we know that we do no (21:29 - 21:35)
rumor wise (21:32 - 21:37)
one of those is coming after these two (21:35 - 21:39)
are released (21:37 - 21:42)
um so chandelier is an attacker (21:39 - 21:45)
um it was not doing well on the public (21:42 - 21:47)
test servers for a while and they (21:45 - 21:51)
recently just did a big boost to it on (21:47 - 21:53)
the test server so a lot of people are a (21:51 - 21:56)
lot happier with it we will see (21:53 - 21:58)
um (21:56 - 22:01)
what it actually because it always (21:58 - 22:03)
changes for final release like we're (22:01 - 22:05)
always like oh it was working this way (22:03 - 22:07)
and then now it's not that dead at all (22:05 - 22:10)
uh when it hits (22:07 - 22:15)
um and uh Umbreon is uh is it another (22:10 - 22:16)
Defender we're getting a lot of (22:15 - 22:18)
Defenders (22:16 - 22:21)
um it's got some really interesting (22:18 - 22:22)
uh (22:21 - 22:24)
uh abilities it has (22:22 - 22:27)
um it's getting mean looking Foul Play (22:24 - 22:31)
uh it's gonna get wish and snarl and (22:27 - 22:33)
then uh it's unite is called the (22:31 - 22:37)
Moonlight prance which is (22:33 - 22:41)
it's unite it leaps up and absorbs (22:37 - 22:44)
Shields from the Pokemon around it which (22:41 - 22:45)
is what everybody's super excited about (22:44 - 22:48)
so when (22:45 - 22:50)
I don't think I Shields everybody (22:48 - 22:53)
uh Serena gets its own Shield like a lot (22:50 - 22:56)
of creatures Shield themselves as part (22:53 - 22:58)
of their defense boost (22:56 - 23:00)
umbreon's (22:58 - 23:03)
ability eats that up and takes it away (23:00 - 23:06)
uh it does not seem to work on Rey's (23:03 - 23:08)
Shield unfortunately that may change (23:06 - 23:11)
when it gets released but right now the (23:08 - 23:13)
rumors and people have been play testing (23:11 - 23:15)
it says it does not affect (23:13 - 23:18)
the Rayquaza Shield at that end of the (23:15 - 23:20)
game we all have our fingers crossed (23:18 - 23:22)
that it will because the race Shields (23:20 - 23:24)
are busted awful and having one Pokemon (23:22 - 23:27)
being able to deal with that uh is (23:24 - 23:29)
really good but of course then everybody (23:27 - 23:31)
would want to run Umbreon which is a (23:29 - 23:33)
sort of bad precedent to set when you're (23:31 - 23:35)
trying to balance that right so Umbreon (23:33 - 23:38)
Cameron comfy Lapras (23:35 - 23:40)
teams are gonna be very limited (23:38 - 23:43)
uh what what is the chandelier supposed (23:40 - 23:45)
to do (23:43 - 23:45)
Chandelure looking cute which I'm very (23:46 - 23:51)
into but like what is (23:49 - 23:54)
what is the the give I guess attackers (23:51 - 23:56)
don't have like crazy gimmicks normally (23:54 - 23:59)
yeah they don't have crazy uh camera uh (23:56 - 24:02)
so the thing is uh its ability allows (23:59 - 24:05)
Chandelure to partially ignore special (24:02 - 24:08)
defense so this was the this was the (24:05 - 24:10)
defense problem that zashian had because (24:08 - 24:11)
Chelsea was also supposed to partially (24:10 - 24:14)
ignore defense but ignored 100 percent (24:11 - 24:18)
Chandler has the same thing it's uh (24:14 - 24:19)
basically those are Ember and Nightshade (24:18 - 24:23)
which are pretty standard uh it gets (24:19 - 24:25)
fire blast which seems to be similar to (24:23 - 24:26)
what (24:25 - 24:28)
um (24:26 - 24:31)
Dell Fox have same with Mystic of fire (24:28 - 24:33)
um but then it's a second moves are (24:31 - 24:36)
poltergeist which it creates a Zone uh (24:33 - 24:39)
that has uh all the remember (24:36 - 24:40)
um (24:39 - 24:43)
the Dynamics move the night move where (24:40 - 24:44)
else (24:43 - 24:47)
is it's based off of that so you'll see (24:44 - 24:49)
a zone of floating chairs like chairs (24:47 - 24:50)
and tables (24:49 - 24:53)
so furniture and unite that's what I've (24:50 - 24:55)
been waiting for yeah so it's the thing (24:53 - 24:57)
where you put that down and anybody who (24:55 - 24:58)
goes through it is slowed and takes (24:57 - 25:01)
damage so it's it's a Zone move on an (24:58 - 25:03)
attacker (25:01 - 25:05)
um and then the other option is in (25:03 - 25:07)
prison which creates a Zone in front of (25:05 - 25:10)
itself and then anybody who's caught in (25:07 - 25:11)
that zone (25:10 - 25:15)
is all just completely unable to act you (25:11 - 25:16)
can't move you can't (25:15 - 25:19)
attack you can't do anything (25:16 - 25:22)
um and anybody who moves into it also (25:19 - 25:24)
can't move or do anything for its own (25:22 - 25:27)
for a short amount of time (25:24 - 25:30)
um and then it's unite move which is (25:27 - 25:33)
currently ignite midnight uh it just (25:30 - 25:35)
seals an area around itself in darkness (25:33 - 25:39)
so you lose line of sight it's kind of (25:35 - 25:41)
like (25:39 - 25:41)
unite move where it creates a zone of (25:42 - 25:46)
grass and you can't see anything unless (25:45 - 25:50)
you're in there uh and then from that (25:46 - 25:55)
zone uh it can fire beams of fire uh out (25:50 - 25:57)
at people (25:55 - 25:59)
um so (25:57 - 26:02)
it's interesting uh it seems to be much (25:59 - 26:03)
more of the old design where it took (26:02 - 26:05)
bits and pieces from other Pokemon and (26:03 - 26:07)
put them in new ways on this one like (26:05 - 26:09)
nothing in here we're that surprised (26:07 - 26:10)
about (26:09 - 26:12)
um there aren't you know other people (26:10 - 26:15)
have these things like uh the (26:12 - 26:18)
Poltergeist is similar to the giant ice (26:15 - 26:20)
Shard that mammal spine puts down (26:18 - 26:22)
you know all those things are fairly it (26:20 - 26:24)
doesn't sound particularly new (26:22 - 26:26)
no they don't they're not particularly (26:24 - 26:28)
new people aren't that excited about (26:26 - 26:30)
Chandelure (26:28 - 26:31)
um particularly because it was (26:30 - 26:34)
underperforming on the test server (26:31 - 26:37)
um we'll see when it hits uh you know (26:34 - 26:39)
everything hits live different and are (26:37 - 26:42)
often overpowered so I know there's a a (26:39 - 26:44)
relatively popular Pokemon I remember (26:42 - 26:47)
the like top 10 Unova Pokemon that they (26:44 - 26:50)
did and cheddler was like number three (26:47 - 26:51)
or four was like really high up there (26:50 - 26:54)
for Unova which is (26:51 - 26:56)
um it's a bit a bit surprising because I (26:54 - 26:58)
felt like (26:56 - 27:00)
I I I do remember the launch of black (26:58 - 27:02)
and white well it was a weird launch (27:00 - 27:04)
because it was in Japan first and then (27:02 - 27:06)
we had to wait a while for America but (27:04 - 27:08)
people were very like this is just a (27:06 - 27:10)
chandelier this is just an ice cream (27:08 - 27:12)
cone (27:10 - 27:14)
like I did (27:12 - 27:16)
for some reason like (27:14 - 27:19)
Chandelure didn't get wrapped into all (27:16 - 27:21)
of the vanillite and rubbish that kind (27:19 - 27:24)
of still sticks around today but like it (27:21 - 27:28)
was it was not very liked the first like (27:24 - 27:30)
couple months of that game (27:28 - 27:33)
yeah I will say I I'm watching I'm (27:30 - 27:36)
re-watching Litwick move around and look (27:33 - 27:38)
what kind of Glides on wax but he (27:36 - 27:39)
bounces like this (27:38 - 27:44)
[Laughter] (27:39 - 27:44)
the real the real disappointing thing is (27:44 - 27:48)
that you're not saving it for like (27:47 - 27:51)
Halloween I feel like that would be a (27:48 - 27:53)
good yeah Halloween sink pair well maybe (27:51 - 27:57)
another ghost they're doing it now and (27:53 - 27:59)
then probably around Halloween we'll (27:57 - 28:02)
have an event for a special outfits for (27:59 - 28:05)
it right like they get it out now and (28:02 - 28:06)
then they can make the Halloween events (28:05 - 28:08)
or drop people back in and dress them up (28:06 - 28:10)
all cute and stuff I have not I don't (28:08 - 28:11)
know how they're gonna fit the (28:10 - 28:14)
McDonald's hat on Chandelure yet (28:11 - 28:17)
very curious oh yeah the weird visor (28:14 - 28:20)
that they give her (28:17 - 28:20)
yeah that visor is like really they I (28:20 - 28:26)
don't is there cannot be a single person (28:24 - 28:28)
out there being like man I love the way (28:26 - 28:30)
this looks I feel like people just buy (28:28 - 28:31)
it because they're like I want some (28:30 - 28:34)
outfit yeah (28:31 - 28:37)
for a while they had discounted those so (28:34 - 28:39)
much that I bought a bunch of them I'm (28:37 - 28:41)
like well I just gotta do it because I (28:39 - 28:42)
have all these tickets that I can spend (28:41 - 28:44)
nothing else on so I might as well get (28:42 - 28:46)
them and I will never use them because (28:44 - 28:48)
they're ugly (28:46 - 28:52)
they look like fast food workers they do (28:48 - 28:54)
they do (28:52 - 28:57)
I was I'm still with like (28:54 - 29:00)
I I there has been instances where I'm (28:57 - 29:01)
like planning out my content for the (29:00 - 29:04)
week and I'll like log into unite to (29:01 - 29:06)
like check the bonuses and get rid of (29:04 - 29:08)
those like red dots and stuff and I'm (29:06 - 29:10)
like okay I think this week we'll be (29:08 - 29:12)
able to like squeeze in an evening at (29:10 - 29:14)
two of unite and get back to it and (29:12 - 29:17)
stuff and then all of a sudden Scarlet (29:14 - 29:19)
Violet announces some new Raid event or (29:17 - 29:22)
some distribution or some tournament I'm (29:19 - 29:25)
like oh well maybe unite next week (29:22 - 29:28)
um but when I did check it (29:25 - 29:31)
I was shocked that they're still (29:28 - 29:34)
seems to be a lack of costumes overall (29:31 - 29:37)
in that game (29:34 - 29:41)
like I know everyone was very mad about (29:37 - 29:44)
the 40 costumes understandably so forty (29:41 - 29:48)
dollars for a skin is is is is not a (29:44 - 29:50)
great deal even though I'm sure it sells (29:48 - 29:51)
very well because they continued to do (29:50 - 29:55)
40 costumes but (29:51 - 29:55)
there there hasn't even been I know I (29:55 - 29:59)
like crime around a lot there hasn't (29:58 - 30:01)
been a cramerant skin since the (29:59 - 30:06)
anniversary Prime rant skin and I was (30:01 - 30:08)
like oh while Charizard has to have a (30:06 - 30:11)
new skin because it's Charizard and they (30:08 - 30:15)
don't have a new skin like (30:11 - 30:15)
I don't want to be like I don't I (30:15 - 30:18)
obviously I want unite to succeed even (30:17 - 30:20)
though it's like not my favorite game in (30:18 - 30:21)
the world I do like unite I do I do (30:20 - 30:23)
genuinely like it I just don't have time (30:21 - 30:24)
to play it but (30:23 - 30:27)
isn't the main Money Maker skins why are (30:24 - 30:29)
they not putting out like one a week (30:27 - 30:35)
um so what seems to be there (30:29 - 30:35)
plan is a lot of new skins are locked (30:37 - 30:44)
behind the subscription pass (30:41 - 30:47)
and so they don't have many in the shop (30:44 - 30:50)
but they are in the battle pass the (30:47 - 30:53)
season pass in the subscription pass and (30:50 - 30:54)
they're much more you see it once and (30:53 - 30:57)
then it's gone and I they tend not to (30:54 - 31:00)
list them again like hey you miss this (30:57 - 31:02)
um and they're very very selective about (31:00 - 31:04)
which ones they do like the Zara costume (31:02 - 31:07)
coming up is really really cool but (31:04 - 31:08)
won't be purchasable on the top it's (31:07 - 31:11)
part of the season pass so they have a (31:08 - 31:12)
look on fomo and trying to get people to (31:11 - 31:14)
sign up for the subscription yeah but (31:12 - 31:17)
like I logged in to see what the season (31:14 - 31:19)
or the what was it called the monthly (31:17 - 31:22)
subscription pass yeah and it was like (31:19 - 31:25)
Wigglytuff in an egg and I was like oh (31:22 - 31:27)
this is this is super cute but also I (31:25 - 31:29)
don't play Wigglytuff so I don't want to (31:27 - 31:31)
give you what was it ten dollars a month (31:29 - 31:33)
yeah I don't want to give you ten (31:31 - 31:34)
dollars for the skin plus whatever other (31:33 - 31:38)
things you get yeah like this have (31:34 - 31:41)
multiple skins for each character yeah (31:38 - 31:45)
um they're really still pretty stingy um (31:41 - 31:49)
they only give you one option and they (31:45 - 31:51)
only run like most of the season passes (31:49 - 31:54)
only two Pokemon are getting special (31:51 - 31:58)
outfits in that season pass one (31:54 - 31:58)
and I don't know (31:59 - 32:06)
I don't understand their planning around (32:03 - 32:08)
it (32:06 - 32:11)
um they seem to be pretty (32:08 - 32:11)
hesitant to really jack up the prices a (32:13 - 32:17)
lot because they've been doing that to (32:15 - 32:19)
actually purchase the Pokemon (32:17 - 32:22)
so the Pokemon prices have gotten more (32:19 - 32:23)
expensive (32:22 - 32:27)
and they seem to be much more focusing (32:23 - 32:29)
on getting new characters out than (32:27 - 32:32)
getting them outfits because we have (32:29 - 32:34)
gotten a really steady stream of new (32:32 - 32:37)
characters over the last year yeah (32:34 - 32:42)
um which is it which is great uh but (32:37 - 32:44)
I I'm wondering if they just saw that (32:42 - 32:46)
not a lot of people unless they're (32:44 - 32:48)
paying for their particular special (32:46 - 32:51)
Pokemon are buying outfits but then I (32:48 - 32:52)
don't know what it's like this weird (32:51 - 32:54)
Loop because they're not putting it up (32:52 - 32:56)
another I guess I'm it wouldn't be a (32:54 - 32:58)
episode of our show if I didn't bring up (32:56 - 33:01)
Apex Legends Apex Legends is like one (32:58 - 33:04)
character every like two or three months (33:01 - 33:06)
I can't remember how often it's a new (33:04 - 33:07)
care I think it's every three months (33:06 - 33:10)
it's one new character but they do like (33:07 - 33:11)
they literally like their events are (33:10 - 33:13)
literally just skin events (33:11 - 33:15)
like their last event in Apex Legends (33:13 - 33:18)
was literally called the recolor event (33:15 - 33:21)
where they just recolored different guns (33:18 - 33:23)
that we've already had before into a (33:21 - 33:25)
different shade of like red and blue (33:23 - 33:28)
like they were very blatant that none of (33:25 - 33:31)
these are new skins they're just (33:28 - 33:33)
different color skins of skins that (33:31 - 33:37)
already exist like Apex just puts out so (33:33 - 33:40)
many different skits a lot of them are (33:37 - 33:42)
bad for the record I'm not defending a (33:40 - 33:44)
lot of the Skins they put out are awful (33:42 - 33:47)
and bad and I would never equip them or (33:44 - 33:50)
pay for them but ever but they put out (33:47 - 33:53)
so many that you're just like (33:50 - 33:56)
and they do lean into the characters (33:53 - 33:57)
that do well like one of the best (33:56 - 33:59)
characters in Apex is wraith and wraith (33:57 - 34:02)
has so many skins and they must they (33:59 - 34:03)
they must know that like wraith players (34:02 - 34:05)
just they it's the most popular (34:03 - 34:06)
character they just keep buying skins (34:05 - 34:08)
for it just make more wraith skins like (34:06 - 34:10)
because it sells yeah (34:08 - 34:12)
um I don't know I would I I would buy (34:10 - 34:14)
every craber hand skin I'm not gonna lie (34:12 - 34:18)
I would it's tough to also because (34:14 - 34:20)
they've made so many changes to how (34:18 - 34:23)
tournaments run and how (34:20 - 34:26)
they are (34:23 - 34:29)
setting up like super competitive unite (34:26 - 34:31)
a lot of what I'm seeing is them really (34:29 - 34:33)
trying to lock that down (34:31 - 34:36)
like we're still waiting for the for (34:33 - 34:38)
them to release skins to make your (34:36 - 34:40)
Pokemon Shiny because you know they're (34:38 - 34:42)
going to have that's going to come like (34:40 - 34:44)
that is the easiest win (34:42 - 34:47)
uh and the next thing they're releasing (34:44 - 34:50)
are backgrounds like you can change your (34:47 - 34:53)
lobby background I saw that the (34:50 - 34:56)
background of the waiting screen as (34:53 - 34:58)
you're waiting to load in like the (34:56 - 35:01)
loadings will it make the lobby faster (34:58 - 35:01)
interrupted those menus for the rest of (35:05 - 35:10)
your life (35:07 - 35:10)
I I don't I don't know their game plan (35:13 - 35:19)
um I think right now they are definitely (35:17 - 35:22)
trying to get a lot of characters (35:19 - 35:25)
in set and established to make (35:22 - 35:28)
tournaments much more exciting (35:25 - 35:31)
and then we'll probably loop back around (35:28 - 35:33)
to being like now let's build skins for (35:31 - 35:35)
them like I I can't fathom their (35:33 - 35:37)
trajectory right now because it's not (35:35 - 35:38)
like (35:37 - 35:41)
easy to dissect they're deciding these (35:38 - 35:42)
things because we still have never (35:41 - 35:45)
gotten a Speedster it's been no we got (35:42 - 35:47)
no Drew (35:45 - 35:49)
yeah that's the last one we got yeah and (35:47 - 35:51)
that was a while ago that was a while (35:49 - 35:52)
ago (35:51 - 35:55)
well like again going back to Apex they (35:52 - 35:56)
were like hey this season we're not (35:55 - 35:59)
doing a new character because we want to (35:56 - 36:00)
like (35:59 - 36:05)
fix our game The Game's always broken (36:00 - 36:05)
um so that's what's like weird to me (36:05 - 36:10)
about unite is like if they want to like (36:07 - 36:12)
finalize and make the tournament seem (36:10 - 36:13)
better which I think they should do like (36:12 - 36:15)
the tournament stuff is the more like (36:13 - 36:18)
the the the thing I appreciate the most (36:15 - 36:19)
about Unite (36:18 - 36:22)
is I I think as long as you've played (36:19 - 36:25)
like three hours of unite you can watch (36:22 - 36:26)
a tournament and pretty much understand (36:25 - 36:29)
exactly what's happening (36:26 - 36:32)
um which is really great because I (36:29 - 36:34)
when I sit around other Pokemon fans or (36:32 - 36:37)
just other people in general it's it's (36:34 - 36:40)
it's pretty easy for most people to (36:37 - 36:42)
watch a competitive battle (36:40 - 36:44)
in VGC (36:42 - 36:46)
and understand what's going wrong they (36:44 - 36:48)
might not understand like why why what (36:46 - 36:50)
happened to toss agory well tassagiri (36:48 - 36:54)
why what where did it go why is this Don (36:50 - 36:56)
dozo match lasting like 45 minutes like (36:54 - 36:58)
they might not understand that but the (36:56 - 37:01)
general of like fire Pokemon gets hit by (36:58 - 37:02)
a water move of course that would knock (37:01 - 37:05)
it out like they understand that (37:02 - 37:09)
it is impossible for somebody to sit (37:05 - 37:10)
down and watch the Pokemon Trading Card (37:09 - 37:12)
Game on Twitch or YouTube in a (37:10 - 37:15)
tournament final and be like (37:12 - 37:17)
I'm following this like I I can follow (37:15 - 37:20)
it because because I play TCG (37:17 - 37:22)
competitively even if I haven't played (37:20 - 37:24)
with the new set a lot of the mechanics (37:22 - 37:26)
in the TCG are the same like oh this (37:24 - 37:27)
Pokemon has this ability that existed (37:26 - 37:29)
like five years ago on this card like (37:27 - 37:32)
there's a lot of tropes in the TCG that (37:29 - 37:34)
they just kind of recycle and carry (37:32 - 37:38)
throughout it's so hard to explain that (37:34 - 37:40)
or to like try to keep somebody up even (37:38 - 37:42)
if somebody's played like even if (37:40 - 37:43)
somebody went to like Target or Walmart (37:42 - 37:45)
and they bought it like a starter deck (37:43 - 37:47)
and they like read the rules and like (37:45 - 37:49)
did like a couple games I still think (37:47 - 37:51)
for those people it's really hard to (37:49 - 37:53)
follow (37:51 - 37:56)
Tournament level TCG (37:53 - 37:57)
um which I don't know how you make that (37:56 - 37:59)
better honestly I don't know if there is (37:57 - 38:00)
a way to make that better but like for (37:59 - 38:03)
unite I think it I think (38:00 - 38:06)
it might be even easier to understand (38:03 - 38:08)
than VGC kind of stuff because you (38:06 - 38:10)
you're just like even if even if you (38:08 - 38:11)
don't know what the Pokemon are (38:10 - 38:13)
doing like oh I don't know what Sableye (38:11 - 38:15)
does but I do know the general goal is (38:13 - 38:18)
like right get points dunk points attack (38:15 - 38:23)
Rayquaza dunk points like like unite to (38:18 - 38:26)
me is one of the most enjoyable things (38:23 - 38:29)
to watch competitively and I get so like (38:26 - 38:33)
that's why I I don't really (38:29 - 38:36)
like uh uh I want to I I want to see you (38:33 - 38:38)
unite succeed because like for me it's (38:36 - 38:39)
something that even though I don't play (38:38 - 38:41)
I can watch (38:39 - 38:43)
when a tournament happens and have such (38:41 - 38:45)
a good time with it and appreciate it on (38:43 - 38:46)
that level (38:45 - 38:47)
yeah I mean I think the problem that (38:46 - 38:49)
they're facing right now is the fact (38:47 - 38:50)
that cone face broken which we all said (38:49 - 38:52)
it was going to be and the fact that the (38:50 - 38:54)
only Pokemon that in tournaments they're (38:52 - 38:56)
banning right now is comfy like (38:54 - 39:00)
okay you need to fix that so that's not (38:56 - 39:02)
the only thing that they ban because it (39:00 - 39:05)
just it's not working again like we told (39:02 - 39:08)
you like we ever tried to warn you that (39:05 - 39:12)
this is a problem uh so I think (39:08 - 39:14)
like (39:12 - 39:16)
of a lot of the games I think unite is (39:14 - 39:20)
in a very good place like it's exciting (39:16 - 39:23)
to watch it's easy to pick up it's (39:20 - 39:26)
easy to get into matches you only really (39:23 - 39:28)
get super super frustrated and ranked (39:26 - 39:30)
depending on what you want out of it (39:28 - 39:31)
like you know that standard is just (39:30 - 39:34)
going to be chaos because nobody in (39:31 - 39:36)
standard understands and they're playing (39:34 - 39:38)
with things and they're trying things (39:36 - 39:39)
out (39:38 - 39:41)
um and you can get into ranked and (39:39 - 39:43)
hopefully have a better experience more (39:41 - 39:46)
violation will very much vary on that (39:43 - 39:48)
one but I think overall like they have a (39:46 - 39:51)
very good vision of what the game is and (39:48 - 39:53)
it's easy to understand when you watch (39:51 - 39:55)
it (39:53 - 39:57)
um I think they have a lot of balancing (39:55 - 40:02)
to do and with 900 Pokemon existing (39:57 - 40:05)
um there's so many options but there's (40:02 - 40:08)
still so much to balance (40:05 - 40:09)
um but like I play unite almost every (40:08 - 40:11)
day (40:09 - 40:12)
um (40:11 - 40:14)
you know you can get in play three ten (40:12 - 40:16)
minute matches you know it's about 45 (40:14 - 40:18)
minutes because you often have to wait (40:16 - 40:21)
or just battle through the menus to get (40:18 - 40:24)
to the fun part but then you can just be (40:21 - 40:26)
done it's like I had a I had a great (40:24 - 40:28)
time I moved up I moved down and then (40:26 - 40:29)
I'm out (40:28 - 40:31)
um there are a lot of like (40:29 - 40:33)
there are a lot of quibbles to be had in (40:31 - 40:36)
that game like the ranking is weird the (40:33 - 40:39)
matching is still weird the the amount (40:36 - 40:41)
you lose and gain from winning and (40:39 - 40:45)
losing is really feels out of whack like (40:41 - 40:48)
oh it's terrible you can get very little (40:45 - 40:51)
incremental wins and then a setback will (40:48 - 40:54)
knock you way down and then it flips (40:51 - 40:58)
horribly in Masters where wins get you (40:54 - 41:00)
huge amount of points and losses only (40:58 - 41:02)
take you down a little (41:00 - 41:05)
um there's just a lot of internal stuff (41:02 - 41:06)
when you get really into the game that (41:05 - 41:08)
is slightly frustrating but (41:06 - 41:11)
you we all keep coming back because (41:08 - 41:12)
ultimately it's 10 minutes of just like (41:11 - 41:14)
I'm running around as my favorite (41:12 - 41:16)
Pokemon and you're having a good time (41:14 - 41:18)
I'm riding a Lapras why would I I'm (41:16 - 41:19)
lighting a Lapras from one side of the (41:18 - 41:21)
screen to the other and I had no say in (41:19 - 41:25)
the matter I just flew Like the Wind (41:21 - 41:25)
all right uh speaking of the wind we're (41:27 - 41:36)
gonna blow our way to a break (41:30 - 41:36)
because (41:36 - 41:41)
welcome to the farts section of the show (41:37 - 41:41)
we will be uh uh right back (41:42 - 41:47)
and we are back from our break uh let's (41:48 - 41:54)
talk about Typhlosion Typhlosion came (41:52 - 41:55)
and went (41:54 - 41:57)
they did this thing where (41:55 - 42:01)
they did uh two weeks back to back of (41:57 - 42:03)
decidueye and then without any breaks (42:01 - 42:06)
two weeks back to back with (42:03 - 42:08)
uh Samurai what was that next Pokemon (42:06 - 42:11)
and then two weeks back to back with (42:08 - 42:12)
Typhlosion there's no coincidence (42:11 - 42:16)
obviously these are the hisuian Pokemon (42:12 - 42:18)
uh maybe a slight fun fact I don't know (42:16 - 42:21)
if this was intentional or not but (42:18 - 42:21)
um (42:21 - 42:24)
history uh (42:21 - 42:26)
deciduous Terror type was super (42:24 - 42:28)
effective against hisuin decidueye (42:26 - 42:30)
samrat's Terror type of bug was super (42:28 - 42:33)
effective against Hisui and Samurai and (42:30 - 42:35)
then ghost is super effective against (42:33 - 42:38)
Ghost so uh Typhlosion is technically (42:35 - 42:40)
super effective against his sui and (42:38 - 42:41)
Typhlosion (42:40 - 42:43)
um so again I don't know if that's a (42:41 - 42:47)
coincidence uh there there is no (42:43 - 42:47)
there is no uh also there is no (42:47 - 42:53)
coincidence that all the Pokemon that (42:50 - 42:56)
could have hesuyan forms are in this are (42:53 - 42:58)
in scarlet and violet growlith Sneasel (42:56 - 43:00)
yep (42:58 - 43:03)
um quill fish Stantler or Ursa ring (43:00 - 43:05)
they're they're all they're all in (43:03 - 43:09)
paldea so uh we will I don't know if (43:05 - 43:12)
it's going to be an uneventful update of (43:09 - 43:15)
like history and Pokemon are here I (43:12 - 43:17)
don't know if it's going to be like uh (43:15 - 43:20)
maybe a Pokemon Legends update where (43:17 - 43:22)
it's like a free we added a little bit (43:20 - 43:24)
of extra content for everyone I don't (43:22 - 43:25)
know if they're gonna wait till they (43:24 - 43:28)
will see uh who knows we do know that (43:25 - 43:30)
there should be an update at the end of (43:28 - 43:32)
April for this game (43:30 - 43:35)
we don't know what that even knows we (43:32 - 43:37)
know that walking the game we know that (43:35 - 43:39)
walking wake and iron leaves will come (43:37 - 43:42)
back at the end of April yes so that's (43:39 - 43:43)
at least one weekend where there won't (43:42 - 43:46)
be a seven-star rate happening because (43:43 - 43:49)
those are five stars maybe they're not (43:46 - 43:51)
going to do seven star rates for until (43:49 - 43:55)
June maybe we get a month off (43:51 - 43:58)
ah well I I do like seven surveys a lot (43:55 - 44:00)
but you need time to play unite so you (43:58 - 44:02)
can become a Gatling gun true it's very (44:00 - 44:04)
true I need time uh did you both do the (44:02 - 44:07)
Typhlosion rights this weekend if you (44:04 - 44:09)
didn't if you missed it coming back dead (44:07 - 44:13)
and I spoke to you in private about my (44:09 - 44:16)
frustration so we can bring it up here (44:13 - 44:19)
I also played them (44:16 - 44:21)
Pokemon for them kind of (44:19 - 44:24)
if one to a friend and say (44:21 - 44:25)
and said go (44:24 - 44:28)
um it worked well enough we needed one (44:25 - 44:30)
other person who wasn't a computer (44:28 - 44:34)
it was fine yeah I mean they were fun (44:30 - 44:36)
um I had my Dash booned (44:34 - 44:40)
uh and I will say the frustration was (44:36 - 44:41)
that (44:40 - 44:43)
because of the weird things that (44:41 - 44:45)
overlapped each other and because the (44:43 - 44:48)
rays are still slightly (44:45 - 44:51)
not working (44:48 - 44:52)
um sometimes they're a little chunky (44:51 - 44:56)
yeah there were I spent a lot of my (44:52 - 44:59)
first day very confused as to why (44:56 - 45:01)
sometimes Dash buns ability would eat up (44:59 - 45:03)
eruptions (45:01 - 45:07)
and why sometimes it wouldn't at all oh (45:03 - 45:08)
no (45:07 - 45:10)
and it turns out that there was a (45:08 - 45:11)
message (45:10 - 45:13)
that would that I'd never actually saw (45:11 - 45:15)
like I never actually saw the message (45:13 - 45:18)
that explained it ever occur in the game (45:15 - 45:23)
but Steve did at least yeah I was I was (45:18 - 45:24)
telling Greg because I was editing a (45:23 - 45:26)
follow-up YouTube video (45:24 - 45:28)
and I was like (45:26 - 45:31)
I I was poor I was like oh in the video (45:28 - 45:32)
I want to point out that your abilities (45:31 - 45:35)
will get suppressed around turn three (45:32 - 45:37)
and I went back to my twitch VOD and I (45:35 - 45:38)
was like (45:37 - 45:41)
oh I can't it doesn't say it and then I (45:38 - 45:42)
was like that's okay I'll just go to the (45:41 - 45:43)
next battle and I was like oh it doesn't (45:42 - 45:45)
say it I was like okay I ended up like (45:43 - 45:48)
doing Typhlosion like 25 times (45:45 - 45:52)
and it took five battles with Typhlosion (45:48 - 45:55)
for me to just find a clip of it saying (45:52 - 45:58)
your abilities have been suppressed yeah (45:55 - 45:59)
and (45:58 - 46:01)
I noticed that the second night I was (45:59 - 46:03)
doing it I was like yeah the the words (46:01 - 46:05)
your ability has been suppressed just (46:03 - 46:08)
are not popping up in the raid kind of (46:05 - 46:10)
important yeah and I spent (46:08 - 46:14)
a huge amount of time being like (46:10 - 46:16)
because also I went through ones where (46:14 - 46:19)
that never happened where it skipped (46:16 - 46:21)
over entirely where I met we never had (46:19 - 46:23)
our abilities suppressed so I was like (46:21 - 46:24)
yeah there was a couple Pokemon that (46:23 - 46:26)
never suppressed I don't think decidueye (46:24 - 46:28)
did and I don't think Pikachu ever did (46:26 - 46:32)
in Typhlosion in ones never had that (46:28 - 46:34)
occur just we went through the whole (46:32 - 46:36)
thing and nobody's ability is I never (46:34 - 46:39)
once was hurt by eruption I got absorbed (46:36 - 46:41)
I don't know if it glitched and skipped (46:39 - 46:43)
but I spent probably the first two hours (46:41 - 46:47)
like trying to figure out what is it the (46:43 - 46:49)
combination of Pokemon that I'm with is (46:47 - 46:52)
this some random thing is it that we're (46:49 - 46:54)
skipping over phases quicker like I (46:52 - 46:56)
could not figure out because I've never (46:54 - 46:58)
seen that message come up and it wasn't (46:56 - 47:00)
until I was talking to you like oh (46:58 - 47:01)
they're supposed to be a message that (47:00 - 47:03)
says what happened I'm like yes that (47:01 - 47:06)
would have been (47:03 - 47:06)
there would have at least been like now (47:06 - 47:11)
I understand that this is a part of this (47:08 - 47:13)
and this is actually something that (47:11 - 47:16)
happens it's not just a switch it is a (47:13 - 47:20)
glitch is it what's going on let's not (47:16 - 47:22)
get anything confused the game is a (47:20 - 47:24)
buggy mess because the very first one I (47:22 - 47:27)
did I was like I'm in with a bunch of (47:24 - 47:29)
people we're all sitting there we're (47:27 - 47:31)
fighting and it says (47:29 - 47:32)
uh (47:31 - 47:34)
diflosion use eruptions and I'm like (47:32 - 47:36)
perfect I have a body that doesn't take (47:34 - 47:39)
anything from fire some would say you (47:36 - 47:41)
have a well-baked body I have a (47:39 - 47:42)
well-baked body (47:41 - 47:44)
and the game did its normal hang up (47:42 - 47:47)
where everything just froze (47:44 - 47:50)
for like 30 seconds and I'm like (47:47 - 47:53)
okay and when it snapbacked we were all (47:50 - 47:54)
dead (47:53 - 47:56)
all four across the board and I'm like (47:54 - 47:57)
I'm (47:56 - 48:00)
not what just happened what I thought we (47:57 - 48:03)
would fix this what is going on in this (48:00 - 48:05)
scenario you just explained is very (48:03 - 48:07)
Final Fantasy 14 where something just (48:05 - 48:09)
happens in everyone's day everybody's (48:07 - 48:11)
dead (48:09 - 48:11)
but like usually you could go I'm like (48:14 - 48:18)
okay what message did I miss and there (48:16 - 48:23)
wasn't a message yeah I found Typhlosion (48:18 - 48:26)
frustrating for that fact like I could (48:23 - 48:29)
not until I talk to you figure out (48:26 - 48:31)
what I was missing it yeah because the (48:29 - 48:34)
game wasn't telling me (48:31 - 48:35)
um (48:34 - 48:37)
I thought the rage were fine like I (48:35 - 48:39)
think they're fun but like when it does (48:37 - 48:41)
things like that where important (48:39 - 48:44)
information doesn't show up it's really (48:41 - 48:46)
hard to explain to people what's (48:44 - 48:49)
happening when you yourself don't even (48:46 - 48:53)
know like I I would have people text me (48:49 - 48:55)
like I I don't I don't know I I can't (48:53 - 48:57)
figure it out I can't figure out why (48:55 - 48:59)
this is happening because the game isn't (48:57 - 49:01)
giving me a message yeah (48:59 - 49:03)
yeah and I I didn't really realize it (49:01 - 49:05)
until I was like I just need a clip of (49:03 - 49:07)
this and I was like watching my VOD back (49:05 - 49:09)
and like oh it's it's not I know I know (49:07 - 49:11)
what's happening but like I'm the (49:09 - 49:13)
message isn't popping up (49:11 - 49:14)
um (49:13 - 49:16)
we can only hope that you know stuff (49:14 - 49:19)
like that gets it gets fixed uh I I have (49:16 - 49:21)
so many thoughts on Typhlosion which is (49:19 - 49:23)
kind of crazy because I before (49:21 - 49:25)
the recording I was like oh this is just (49:23 - 49:27)
another seven star raid you know people (49:25 - 49:30)
come in to my twitch streams or if you (49:27 - 49:32)
see on social medias you know some (49:30 - 49:34)
people will say this is the easiest one (49:32 - 49:35)
ever and then some people will say this (49:34 - 49:37)
was the hardest one ever you know that (49:35 - 49:39)
that's going to be for every raid uh (49:37 - 49:41)
like yeah (49:39 - 49:42)
but some people have the right Pokemon (49:41 - 49:44)
some people they they got really good (49:42 - 49:46)
RNG and they did it three times with (49:44 - 49:47)
great people (49:46 - 49:49)
um they got really bad RNG they did (49:47 - 49:51)
but with bad people uh I got to (49:49 - 49:54)
experience both (49:51 - 49:56)
um so I I did my RAID builds right you (49:54 - 49:58)
know I was like (49:56 - 50:00)
here are the Pokemon I recommend that (49:58 - 50:02)
could survive eruption in the Sun and (50:00 - 50:05)
that's what it had it had eruption in (50:02 - 50:06)
the Sun so like I built Pokemon that (50:05 - 50:08)
could survive eruption in the sun they (50:06 - 50:09)
ended up working out great Dodge bun was (50:08 - 50:11)
one of those Pokemon (50:09 - 50:13)
um it does work right when you know (50:11 - 50:15)
Typhlosion communicates what's happening (50:13 - 50:16)
yep (50:15 - 50:18)
that's not ashburn's fault that's the (50:16 - 50:20)
game's fault (50:18 - 50:20)
um (50:20 - 50:23)
so I I ended up you know every every (50:20 - 50:24)
time these raids come out I try to carry (50:23 - 50:26)
as many people through and people really (50:24 - 50:27)
appreciate it because not everyone's (50:26 - 50:28)
good at Pokemon (50:27 - 50:30)
um which is totally understandable these (50:28 - 50:31)
raids are (50:30 - 50:33)
harder than a lot of content that (50:31 - 50:35)
Pokemon has ever provided before I I (50:33 - 50:36)
don't think that's a I don't think it's (50:35 - 50:37)
like a weird statement I know people are (50:36 - 50:38)
like there's but people might say oh (50:37 - 50:40)
they're so easy they are some of the (50:38 - 50:42)
hardest content that Pokemon has (50:40 - 50:44)
provided before and if you're an (50:42 - 50:46)
experienced Pokemon player (50:44 - 50:49)
obviously you you know the ins and outs (50:46 - 50:51)
you know what moves do right but for a (50:49 - 50:53)
lot of people (50:51 - 50:55)
this is hard content for them not hard (50:53 - 50:58)
enough where it's like Pokemon Masters (50:55 - 50:59)
end game content where you need to like (50:58 - 51:01)
bring out a spreadsheet and like have a (50:59 - 51:05)
whole Journal dedicated yeah (51:01 - 51:08)
it's on a different level over there (51:05 - 51:10)
you gotta have like a whole whiteboard (51:08 - 51:12)
in your house it is (51:10 - 51:14)
like the puzzle pieces are more (51:12 - 51:16)
complicated than what they ask it (51:14 - 51:18)
because you still have to keep in mind (51:16 - 51:20)
like (51:18 - 51:23)
the terror type affects it in one way (51:20 - 51:25)
but the moves are also boosted and you (51:23 - 51:27)
have to sort of like compensate for you (51:25 - 51:29)
know three or four different types at (51:27 - 51:30)
this point (51:29 - 51:32)
um and put things together in a way (51:30 - 51:33)
because you think oh this is great (51:32 - 51:35)
because it's effective against this but (51:33 - 51:37)
then you're weak against that so like (51:35 - 51:39)
it's a it's a more interesting puzzle (51:37 - 51:43)
than they've done in the past for sure (51:39 - 51:43)
yeah so that takes me to like you know (51:43 - 51:50)
Thursday night it came out (51:47 - 51:51)
you know (51:50 - 51:55)
we we went through 25 successful great I (51:51 - 51:56)
think we ended up like failing twice (51:55 - 51:59)
just because you know (51:56 - 52:01)
people forgot that (51:59 - 52:03)
cheering is a thing you know no big deal (52:01 - 52:05)
right like it's sometimes somebody (52:03 - 52:07)
messes up right same thing for any kind (52:05 - 52:09)
of raid in any other game like oh I've (52:07 - 52:12)
my bad I thought I had another second or (52:09 - 52:13)
two before I needed to press that button (52:12 - 52:16)
didn't have enough time we failed roll (52:13 - 52:17)
it back no big deal (52:16 - 52:20)
um so then Nintendo reached out to me (52:17 - 52:22)
Mario called me up on the phone and they (52:20 - 52:24)
were like hey we want to do a raid (52:22 - 52:26)
showcase on Thursday and this was on (52:24 - 52:29)
Monday this was on Friday the weekend (52:26 - 52:30)
before so I didn't actually know (52:29 - 52:32)
Typhlosion was coming they were like we (52:30 - 52:34)
want to do a right showcase on Thursday (52:32 - 52:36)
and I was like okay cool and they were (52:34 - 52:37)
like what time are you free and I was (52:36 - 52:40)
like whatever Nintendo like I work at (52:37 - 52:44)
I'm self-employed but I am good anytime (52:40 - 52:45)
and they're like cool we'll get back to (52:44 - 52:48)
you then they announced Typhlosion on (52:45 - 52:50)
Sunday night and (52:48 - 52:53)
I thought to myself oh (52:50 - 52:55)
I don't know if like a raid showcase on (52:53 - 52:56)
Thursday is great if there's like a new (52:55 - 52:57)
rate because people are gonna come in (52:56 - 52:59)
and they're gonna want Typhlosion (52:57 - 53:02)
um my thought process is like (52:59 - 53:04)
Nintendo is probably wanting to show off (53:02 - 53:05)
like four or five star raids because (53:04 - 53:07)
they're hitting more of a general (53:05 - 53:10)
audience (53:07 - 53:11)
and they get back to me and they're like (53:10 - 53:14)
okay well what about like Thursday at (53:11 - 53:15)
like three o'clock I was like oh perfect (53:14 - 53:17)
that's before type lotion starts great (53:15 - 53:20)
and then like on Wednesday they were (53:17 - 53:22)
like actually we want to do it on on (53:20 - 53:25)
Friday and I was like oh (53:22 - 53:28)
what shirt Nintendo like we're very last (53:25 - 53:33)
minute here but sure I'm okay so anyways (53:28 - 53:37)
we we have our like pre-screening call (53:33 - 53:38)
um Tech setup making sure everything's (53:37 - 53:41)
working and I was like okay what like (53:38 - 53:43)
what what raids are we doing and they're (53:41 - 53:45)
like oh we want to do Typhlosion raids (53:43 - 53:47)
with you guys so it was me (53:45 - 53:49)
um super duper Danny who we've had on (53:47 - 53:50)
the show before (53:49 - 53:53)
Nintendo fan girl who I've I know who (53:50 - 53:54)
they are I've just never really (53:53 - 53:56)
interacted with them and then so that (53:54 - 53:58)
was three three creators and then (53:56 - 54:00)
somebody at Nintendo there was like (53:58 - 54:02)
three Nintendo people but one person (54:00 - 54:03)
playing (54:02 - 54:05)
and they're like we want to do seven (54:03 - 54:07)
star raids with you we have a lot we (54:05 - 54:10)
this showcase is like 45 minutes (54:07 - 54:12)
um maybe we'll have time to do like a (54:10 - 54:14)
five or a six star raid but (54:12 - 54:17)
um we want to showcase Seven Star raids (54:14 - 54:18)
and I was like okay well that would have (54:17 - 54:20)
been nice little you know a couple hours (54:18 - 54:22)
ago but (54:20 - 54:25)
and (54:22 - 54:25)
for just for the record when I'm telling (54:25 - 54:31)
a story this is this is no shade to any (54:28 - 54:33)
of the other content creators or to (54:31 - 54:34)
Nintendo (54:33 - 54:37)
I I think sometimes because we are in (54:34 - 54:40)
our Pokemon bubble we take things to be (54:37 - 54:41)
easier (54:40 - 54:44)
because we just play these games every (54:41 - 54:46)
single day and like this is the content (54:44 - 54:49)
we do it's like we we do every raid and (54:46 - 54:51)
we like do all the events (54:49 - 54:54)
um but I think it's interesting (54:51 - 54:56)
I think what played out was interesting (54:54 - 54:57)
so (54:56 - 54:59)
um (54:57 - 55:02)
they asked everyone if we have unlocked (54:59 - 55:06)
Seven Star raids and like one of the (55:02 - 55:08)
content creators didn't and then another (55:06 - 55:11)
content creator was like oh I've they're (55:08 - 55:13)
really hard for me but we eventually get (55:11 - 55:14)
through like I haven't been able to do (55:13 - 55:16)
Typhlosion (55:14 - 55:17)
um (55:16 - 55:22)
and I was like okay and I I (55:17 - 55:22)
go we we set up for the right we do we (55:22 - 55:26)
do like a three star we do a five star (55:24 - 55:28)
and then you know that's like 10 minutes (55:26 - 55:29)
of content and then we're like okay well (55:28 - 55:31)
we have time to do like Typhlosion (55:29 - 55:33)
ultimately like three times before our (55:31 - 55:34)
time limit is up (55:33 - 55:38)
and two of them had Dash buns which was (55:34 - 55:41)
like great and then I was bringing my (55:38 - 55:42)
Goodra because I thought Goodra was the (55:41 - 55:44)
strongest out of all the raid builds I I (55:42 - 55:46)
had and then (55:44 - 55:48)
um the Nintendo rep decided to break (55:46 - 55:49)
Noivern (55:48 - 55:52)
and I'm like okay well dragons resist (55:49 - 55:55)
fire that's good (55:52 - 55:56)
um (55:55 - 55:57)
Noivern doesn't have any Ghost type (55:56 - 55:59)
moves I think it might have a I think it (55:57 - 56:02)
has night slash actually uh so yeah who (55:59 - 56:04)
am I to question Nintendo right (56:02 - 56:08)
they had a level 100 Noivern and we go (56:04 - 56:08)
through (56:08 - 56:10)
and (56:08 - 56:12)
I kind of do like the thing I do for my (56:10 - 56:14)
twitch streams I'm just like okay like (56:12 - 56:17)
hey maybe Noivern should defense cheer (56:14 - 56:21)
I'm gonna set rain uh Dash buns you (56:17 - 56:23)
should maybe snarl once or twice and (56:21 - 56:24)
everyone's like yeah yeah cool cool (56:23 - 56:26)
everyone's like really excited that we (56:24 - 56:27)
had like a strategy that we were (56:26 - 56:29)
communicating (56:27 - 56:29)
um (56:29 - 56:31)
and we got a completely like decimated (56:29 - 56:33)
like right off the bat (56:31 - 56:35)
and which was weird because like I did (56:33 - 56:39)
so many the night before and I never (56:35 - 56:40)
have died that fast well like you would (56:39 - 56:42)
die that fast if you like did randoms (56:40 - 56:43)
and somebody brought like a level like (56:42 - 56:47)
30. yeah Sam are out right (56:43 - 56:49)
and I was like wow like I've played with (56:47 - 56:50)
so many Dodge buns I've never seen Dash (56:49 - 56:53)
buns die so quickly like (56:50 - 56:54)
um (56:53 - 56:57)
and then I I realized how the raid could (56:54 - 56:59)
be hard because but you know when people (56:57 - 57:00)
come in and they're like man this was (56:59 - 57:02)
the hardest raid before uh like up to (57:00 - 57:04)
this point I'm like well what point of (57:02 - 57:06)
the raid is hard and I think it was (57:04 - 57:08)
easier to see in older raids like what (57:06 - 57:10)
point of the raid was hard for samurai (57:08 - 57:13)
oh it was when like (57:10 - 57:16)
we it was like when its sword danced (57:13 - 57:17)
after (57:16 - 57:19)
the shield and if you didn't have (57:17 - 57:21)
something to stop that or if you weren't (57:19 - 57:23)
ready like it wipes you what was hard (57:21 - 57:25)
about decision UI kind of the same thing (57:23 - 57:27)
like the sword stance like what was hard (57:25 - 57:28)
about (57:27 - 57:29)
um (57:28 - 57:32)
Greninja I was like oh well we kept (57:29 - 57:34)
missing so event we just lost because we (57:32 - 57:36)
and I was like what (57:34 - 57:38)
what seemed hard about Typhlosion then I (57:36 - 57:40)
realized oh because (57:38 - 57:42)
the no one is doing enough damage at the (57:40 - 57:45)
beginning eruption is just hitting so (57:42 - 57:47)
much harder so in my other raid (57:45 - 57:49)
experiences because everyone brought (57:47 - 57:52)
proper counters and they hit like they'd (57:49 - 57:54)
snarled or they chilling watered or they (57:52 - 57:56)
just hit it really hard you're just (57:54 - 57:58)
minimizing that eruption damage right (57:56 - 58:00)
off the bat on top of like somebody (57:58 - 58:01)
always almost always setting rain as (58:00 - 58:03)
well too (58:01 - 58:04)
um (58:03 - 58:06)
and then I was like I can't as as a (58:04 - 58:08)
Goodra player I can't do that right like (58:06 - 58:11)
like it really shows roles in the game (58:08 - 58:16)
like I can't set rain and hit hard and (58:11 - 58:18)
defense cheer and try to like acid spray (58:16 - 58:21)
to say I can't do it all right (58:18 - 58:23)
um you only have four moves (58:21 - 58:25)
[Music] (58:23 - 58:28)
and then um (58:25 - 58:30)
like the like the like one of the dash (58:28 - 58:31)
buttons had I had noticed they were (58:30 - 58:33)
doing bite and I was like oh they don't (58:31 - 58:34)
have crunch (58:33 - 58:37)
and then I noticed Dash buns didn't have (58:34 - 58:39)
the held items and the Nintendo rep just (58:37 - 58:42)
had four attacks and they were using (58:39 - 58:43)
Rocky helmet I was like oh maybe you (58:42 - 58:45)
should change that to Shell Bell it was (58:43 - 58:47)
like again it's it's no like I'm not (58:45 - 58:49)
trying to like throw them under the bus (58:47 - 58:50)
and be like look at these bad players (58:49 - 58:52)
it's like the game doesn't prep you for (58:50 - 58:55)
anything no like they don't tell you at (58:52 - 58:57)
all so when I was like suggesting like (58:55 - 58:59)
oh maybe you should like put like one of (58:57 - 59:01)
the dash ones was missing snarl I was (58:59 - 59:03)
like oh maybe you should put snarl on it (59:01 - 59:04)
and I was like oh mud slap is really (59:03 - 59:06)
great too because you know uh play rough (59:04 - 59:09)
is 90 one mudslide brings it down to (59:06 - 59:11)
like 85 and they were like really (59:09 - 59:13)
excited and being like Oh like thank you (59:11 - 59:15)
very like they were like genuinely happy (59:13 - 59:17)
to like we have like you're telling a (59:15 - 59:19)
strategy that like nowhere in the game (59:17 - 59:22)
would ever teach us right yep so it was (59:19 - 59:25)
like a really great experience because I (59:22 - 59:28)
I I do think that's like I think of the (59:25 - 59:29)
people who don't watch Twitch don't (59:28 - 59:30)
watch YouTube (59:29 - 59:33)
don't like go out and seek this (59:30 - 59:34)
information and they they're probably (59:33 - 59:36)
the people that get frustrated that like (59:34 - 59:39)
I connect to the internet I'm bringing I (59:36 - 59:42)
don't know my level 100 Samurai because (59:39 - 59:45)
uh water is super effective against fire (59:42 - 59:47)
even though it's not fire obviously (59:45 - 59:49)
um (59:47 - 59:51)
so yeah uh it was it was like a good (59:49 - 59:53)
experience it was cool to see people get (59:51 - 59:57)
excited and willing to like learn (59:53 - 59:59)
like oh like this is all like I've never (59:57 - 60:01)
done it with strategy before we just (59:59 - 60:03)
kind of go in and like brute force it (60:01 - 60:05)
and hope we roll the dice properly yeah (60:03 - 60:08)
exactly yeah and I think that is still (60:05 - 60:12)
one of my bigger complaints about how (60:08 - 60:15)
they set up rates in this like I know a (60:12 - 60:16)
lot of people are like well Final (60:15 - 60:18)
Fantasy never tells you anything and (60:16 - 60:21)
like that is absolutely not true the (60:18 - 60:24)
entire game progression of you playing (60:21 - 60:26)
your character is you're learning the (60:24 - 60:28)
proper way to put your moves into order (60:26 - 60:32)
so you can execute it in tougher content (60:28 - 60:35)
and every dungeon introduces you to a (60:32 - 60:36)
mechanic (60:35 - 60:39)
that you will learn in that one that you (60:36 - 60:41)
will then have to do in a much harder (60:39 - 60:42)
raid later like (60:41 - 60:45)
if you didn't play earlier rage you (60:42 - 60:47)
wouldn't know to stand still for fire (60:45 - 60:49)
attacks and move during ice attacks but (60:47 - 60:52)
they teach you that before (60:49 - 60:55)
in a less intensive way so that when (60:52 - 60:56)
it's layered with something else you (60:55 - 60:59)
have an instinctual way to move and then (60:56 - 61:01)
and Pokemon doesn't do that Pokemon (60:59 - 61:03)
teaches you brute force everything until (61:01 - 61:07)
seven star race and it's like (61:03 - 61:09)
even even with six star raids I feel (61:07 - 61:11)
like a lot of people are just brute (61:09 - 61:13)
forcing it as well you can still (61:11 - 61:16)
get a good win percentage Burt forcing (61:13 - 61:19)
six star raids right totally yeah you (61:16 - 61:22)
can still brute force six star and get (61:19 - 61:25)
more wins than losses I don't think (61:22 - 61:27)
that's true (61:25 - 61:29)
with seven star rates and I think it is (61:27 - 61:32)
a I think it is a slight failing of the (61:29 - 61:35)
game that you have introduced a raid (61:32 - 61:37)
mechanic that you've not taught anybody (61:35 - 61:40)
how to do and you still don't teach them (61:37 - 61:41)
how to do you rely on your community (61:40 - 61:45)
which is good for your community (61:41 - 61:47)
um to do it but (61:45 - 61:50)
we know the majority of people don't (61:47 - 61:52)
watch the same person they don't watch (61:50 - 61:54)
anything at all they don't necessarily (61:52 - 61:56)
go to these things like (61:54 - 61:58)
you're leaving a lot of people on the (61:56 - 62:01)
floor and frustrated with your product (61:58 - 62:04)
because you don't have a way of teaching (62:01 - 62:06)
them earlier on because people can't do (62:04 - 62:08)
these and then they get frustrated and (62:06 - 62:10)
just stop trying (62:08 - 62:12)
and the more that they come out with (62:10 - 62:13)
it's like well I couldn't do any of the (62:12 - 62:15)
others there's no reason why I think I (62:13 - 62:17)
could be able to do this one yeah no I (62:15 - 62:18)
definitely think I still definitely (62:17 - 62:20)
think that they needed some sort of (62:18 - 62:21)
tutorial once you get to Seven Star (62:20 - 62:25)
raids some sort of in-depth tutorial as (62:21 - 62:27)
hand holdy as when they are teaching you (62:25 - 62:29)
how to first throw a Pokeball if they (62:27 - 62:32)
need that when you unlock Seven Star (62:29 - 62:34)
rates (62:32 - 62:36)
I don't know what the (62:34 - 62:39)
like the the experience with Nintendo (62:36 - 62:41)
was like really great I don't know what (62:39 - 62:43)
they wanted to use that for I don't know (62:41 - 62:44)
if that was a test where they want to do (62:43 - 62:46)
something bigger or they want to do (62:44 - 62:48)
something more formal or they tend to (62:46 - 62:49)
announce that there's like something (62:48 - 62:51)
happening for E3 well E3 is canceled but (62:49 - 62:53)
like they're doing some like Treehouse (62:51 - 62:56)
things so it would be cool for Nintendo (62:53 - 62:59)
or the Pokemon company to Showcase that (62:56 - 63:02)
in a better light I don't think what (62:59 - 63:04)
they did with the blog post of like here (63:02 - 63:06)
are five good Raiders and here are the (63:04 - 63:08)
moves because that doesn't explain no (63:06 - 63:10)
I've said I said this in my YouTube (63:08 - 63:11)
video I'll say it again like I made like (63:10 - 63:13)
a hide rigging build for like Greninja (63:11 - 63:15)
and there were people that were like (63:13 - 63:17)
your hydrogen build didn't work and I (63:15 - 63:18)
was like I died to ice beam and I was (63:17 - 63:20)
like well did you like open up with (63:18 - 63:21)
snarl and they're like I never used (63:20 - 63:24)
snarl and it was like but that that's (63:21 - 63:27)
why the move is there yeah so like you (63:24 - 63:28)
can you can (63:27 - 63:30)
that's why again the article on on (63:28 - 63:32)
pokemon.com was like completely useless (63:30 - 63:33)
because it's like it doesn't show you (63:32 - 63:36)
how to Pilot these Pokemon properly (63:33 - 63:39)
um and then like I know there's probably (63:36 - 63:40)
somebody in the comments I I don't know (63:39 - 63:42)
why annihilate players are like it's so (63:40 - 63:44)
it's always like annihilate players or (63:42 - 63:46)
iron hand players or Zuma role players (63:44 - 63:47)
they like need to tell you that they (63:46 - 63:49)
were able to do it with like those three (63:47 - 63:50)
Pokemon specifically I don't know what (63:49 - 63:52)
about those three Pokemon in people's (63:50 - 63:54)
personalities like tied together but (63:52 - 63:56)
like (63:54 - 63:59)
sure you you there are there are 400 (63:56 - 64:02)
Pokemon in this game uh like we we beat (63:59 - 64:03)
uh (64:02 - 64:05)
uh history and Typhlosion with a finian (64:03 - 64:08)
a level 100 finian holding Evo light (64:05 - 64:09)
like I beat Greninja with Vogue Trio (64:08 - 64:14)
like we we beat uh hisuian Sam uh Hisui (64:09 - 64:18)
and Samurai with a bonsai like there are (64:14 - 64:20)
weird things like that's the great thing (64:18 - 64:23)
about Pokemon EVS IVs held items moves (64:20 - 64:25)
they let you do really crazy things the (64:23 - 64:28)
thing I don't like like about the (64:25 - 64:31)
the the I I understand but I don't like (64:28 - 64:33)
it and it pretty much circles back to (64:31 - 64:35)
like the game not teaching you stuff is (64:33 - 64:38)
like the annihilate players that are (64:35 - 64:39)
just like well I just went in and I just (64:38 - 64:42)
hit rage Fist and I won and like that (64:39 - 64:44)
works because ghost is super effective (64:42 - 64:46)
against Ghost and when your NPCs die (64:44 - 64:49)
there's no timer penalty and obvious (64:46 - 64:51)
rage fist in itself is one of the most (64:49 - 64:53)
broken moves I think they've ever (64:51 - 64:54)
introduced in all of Pokemon if you (64:53 - 64:56)
don't know how rage fist works pretty (64:54 - 64:58)
much every time you get hit rage fist (64:56 - 65:01)
gets stronger and stronger and I it caps (64:58 - 65:04)
out at an un ridiculous like amount of (65:01 - 65:06)
damage but what's even crazier about (65:04 - 65:08)
rage fist compared to how other moves (65:06 - 65:13)
work in this game is when you like (65:08 - 65:15)
when used like switch out a Pokemon in a (65:13 - 65:17)
competitive battle like if if you're (65:15 - 65:20)
zashian in sword and shield is plus two (65:17 - 65:22)
and you switch it out and then you bring (65:20 - 65:25)
it back in it's no longer plus two like (65:22 - 65:27)
its ability will activate and we'll go (65:25 - 65:29)
to plus one rage fist for whatever (65:27 - 65:34)
reason remembers always so if you die or (65:29 - 65:37)
you switch out ragefish will continue to (65:34 - 65:39)
remember the damage threshold for it's (65:37 - 65:41)
like if there's anything that's going to (65:39 - 65:44)
get nerfed it's going to be rage fist in (65:41 - 65:47)
some capacity like like Gale Wings on (65:44 - 65:50)
Talonflame got nerfed because like how (65:47 - 65:52)
Gale Wings used to work is as long as (65:50 - 65:54)
it's a flying type move on Talonflame (65:52 - 65:57)
it's going first no matter no matter (65:54 - 65:59)
what like it was so busted in X and Y (65:57 - 66:02)
and then they changed it to Gale Wings (65:59 - 66:05)
would only go first as or any flying (66:02 - 66:06)
type move would always goes to first as (66:05 - 66:10)
long as Talonflame had full HP so (66:06 - 66:11)
there's there's no doubt in my mind Ray (66:10 - 66:13)
Triscuits changed (66:11 - 66:16)
anyways going back to annihilate like (66:13 - 66:18)
the reason I don't like love that is (66:16 - 66:20)
because it doesn't teach you anything (66:18 - 66:24)
it's just I'm going to hit this move and (66:20 - 66:26)
if RNG rolls correctly it might take one (66:24 - 66:29)
two one or two tries but I will I will (66:26 - 66:31)
succeed and I completely understand (66:29 - 66:34)
forcing Brute Force yeah yeah I totally (66:31 - 66:35)
understand why people would do that (66:34 - 66:37)
right because like online is tough (66:35 - 66:40)
because those mechanics aren't taught so (66:37 - 66:43)
it's like well if I can't if if everyone (66:40 - 66:45)
online is unreliable or in the situation (66:43 - 66:46)
where we like I like to go online (66:45 - 66:48)
because I like to see what people are (66:46 - 66:49)
bringing and when then somebody's (66:48 - 66:52)
bringing a level like 85 like Hypno (66:49 - 66:55)
you're like whoa this is (66:52 - 66:57)
[Music] (66:55 - 67:00)
I was curious about the Hypno too it's (66:57 - 67:02)
it's not even the right level I mean I (67:00 - 67:04)
did a lot of random rates with annihil (67:02 - 67:07)
apes and you know dashboard howl and (67:04 - 67:10)
highlight it it worked right like yeah I (67:07 - 67:12)
mean the third one who joined me and my (67:10 - 67:14)
friend was an annihilate player and that (67:12 - 67:17)
got us to the win so yeah it did work (67:14 - 67:19)
but it is very different from actually (67:17 - 67:22)
having strategy right it is a strategy (67:19 - 67:24)
that doesn't carry over right like you (67:22 - 67:27)
didn't really learn how raids work or (67:24 - 67:30)
how to inter interpret the signals and I (67:27 - 67:32)
will say that the signals were often (67:30 - 67:34)
hard to interpret because the game (67:32 - 67:36)
wasn't telling you what those signals (67:34 - 67:37)
were (67:36 - 67:39)
um but I think like yeah (67:37 - 67:42)
you can make a lot of things work right (67:39 - 67:45)
like you as a player can figure out a (67:42 - 67:46)
way (67:45 - 67:48)
to make (67:46 - 67:51)
what you want work like you can hand (67:48 - 67:55)
somebody uh top winning TCG deck that (67:51 - 67:57)
you win with but they don't know how (67:55 - 68:00)
that TCG deck works and they don't know (67:57 - 68:02)
how to play it and they don't know what (68:00 - 68:04)
they're doing so it's a winning strategy (68:02 - 68:06)
but it doesn't matter if the person (68:04 - 68:09)
doesn't know what to do with it and I (68:06 - 68:11)
think that is one of the biggest (68:09 - 68:12)
disconnects people have to understand (68:11 - 68:16)
with seven star raids is if you just (68:12 - 68:20)
give somebody the tool but never tell (68:16 - 68:22)
them what to do with it (68:20 - 68:24)
they are going to get frustrated by it (68:22 - 68:27)
and you saying well it worked for me (68:24 - 68:30)
great tell me how what did you do how (68:27 - 68:33)
did it work for you (68:30 - 68:33)
yeah I mean there's more to that (68:35 - 68:38)
conversation than just racist over and (68:36 - 68:39)
over again like there's more to that (68:38 - 68:41)
conversation than just just use (68:39 - 68:44)
annihilate there is more that has to (68:41 - 68:47)
happen there to teach people how to have (68:44 - 68:51)
fun in these raids and what to do (68:47 - 68:54)
um and you know (68:51 - 68:56)
I play I played I've been playing MMOs (68:54 - 68:59)
since 2004. some are really good at (68:56 - 69:01)
teaching you some are really bad at (68:59 - 69:03)
teaching you and I'm gonna always argue (69:01 - 69:06)
that seven star raids and Pokemon are (69:03 - 69:08)
very very bad at teaching you what to do (69:06 - 69:11)
and it creates a poor experience they (69:08 - 69:13)
are forgiven on some level because this (69:11 - 69:16)
is the first time they've tried it and I (69:13 - 69:19)
can say you don't just despite the fact (69:16 - 69:21)
that this has been around (69:19 - 69:24)
for nearly 20 years now and you just (69:21 - 69:25)
decided not to look at how other people (69:24 - 69:27)
do it that's fine you need to figure it (69:25 - 69:31)
out on your own I get it you get a pass (69:27 - 69:35)
a little bit this time but you really do (69:31 - 69:37)
and I think like when you told me about (69:35 - 69:39)
the Nintendo thing I'm like I'm hoping (69:37 - 69:41)
they're trying to put together some sort (69:39 - 69:44)
of official video to explain what to do (69:41 - 69:46)
that will reach more people than random (69:44 - 69:49)
streamers and YouTubers on the internet (69:46 - 69:52)
yeah I and (69:49 - 69:55)
I I think the the Common Thread between (69:52 - 69:58)
uh annihilate players and iron hand (69:55 - 70:01)
players and azumero players is they are (69:58 - 70:04)
the the they're the Bare Bones simplest (70:01 - 70:06)
strategies in the world for annihilate (70:04 - 70:09)
and iron hands it is it is belly drum (70:06 - 70:11)
attack with a nightlight that's even (70:09 - 70:15)
simpler it's it's just it's just attack (70:11 - 70:19)
the the uh the the common thing between (70:15 - 70:21)
those players is they don't ever heal (70:19 - 70:23)
they don't ever defense cheer they don't (70:21 - 70:26)
ever hit any other moves they just do (70:23 - 70:29)
that and if they fail it is everyone's (70:26 - 70:31)
fault but their own fault (70:29 - 70:35)
um and it like sucks because like (70:31 - 70:35)
raids could go much smoother (70:36 - 70:40)
and like Hannah said that they they did (70:38 - 70:43)
it with a analy player or or Greg did it (70:40 - 70:45)
with an ally player like I made dash (70:43 - 70:47)
button because I expected annihilate (70:45 - 70:51)
players and like howl on dashbun really (70:47 - 70:54)
helps out annihilate really well like (70:51 - 70:58)
and it's a good pairing and (70:54 - 70:59)
um (70:58 - 71:01)
it's again but like (70:59 - 71:04)
I guess the start of this was (71:01 - 71:06)
like those those strats they they work (71:04 - 71:08)
because you can Brute Force but they (71:06 - 71:09)
don't like teach teamwork like if (71:08 - 71:11)
there's a dark type (71:09 - 71:15)
Tara Seven Star raid (71:11 - 71:16)
I rage Fest isn't going to do the job (71:15 - 71:19)
because dark resists (71:16 - 71:21)
ghost right like rage Fest did really (71:19 - 71:23)
well here because ghost is super (71:21 - 71:25)
effective against Ghost so it's almost (71:23 - 71:28)
like my my Brute Force strategy didn't (71:25 - 71:30)
work what is the next Brute Force (71:28 - 71:33)
strategy I can do and it's like you're (71:30 - 71:36)
not really learning but at the same time (71:33 - 71:38)
it's the game's fault because if you (71:36 - 71:40)
have a strategy and then you go in and (71:38 - 71:43)
then you're with three people who are (71:40 - 71:45)
have no clue what they're doing (71:43 - 71:46)
then you also have a miserable (71:45 - 71:48)
experience so I again I understand why (71:46 - 71:50)
people are like I just want to brute (71:48 - 71:51)
force it because I just want to do it (71:50 - 71:53)
but (71:51 - 71:55)
then what happens is these people who (71:53 - 71:57)
like brute force it they see success and (71:55 - 71:58)
they think that it's working so then (71:57 - 71:59)
they go online and then they get (71:58 - 72:02)
frustrated because all of a sudden (71:59 - 72:04)
there's no teamwork and then they go (72:02 - 72:05)
back to being like watch I'm just gonna (72:04 - 72:07)
solo and then they get confident and (72:05 - 72:09)
then they go back online and they're (72:07 - 72:10)
like oh it's not working everyone must (72:09 - 72:12)
be bad but me because it works offline I (72:10 - 72:13)
was like (72:12 - 72:16)
this is a never-ending cycle of (72:13 - 72:18)
Why seven star raids will never get (72:16 - 72:22)
better I I too I think (72:18 - 72:22)
I do think they're they have gotten (72:22 - 72:27)
better (72:26 - 72:30)
in in a small weird way of I think (72:27 - 72:33)
because the people playing this game (72:30 - 72:35)
still are more hardcore than the people (72:33 - 72:38)
who just got credits and move back to (72:35 - 72:41)
fortnite I think in that sense the (72:38 - 72:43)
online experience has gotten slightly (72:41 - 72:45)
better but for every time you have a (72:43 - 72:47)
great raid you have like (72:45 - 72:50)
well we have a level (72:47 - 72:54)
32 Raichu here against this (72:50 - 72:58)
I mean the the the sad thing is is that (72:54 - 73:00)
as more people who don't know what (72:58 - 73:01)
they're doing get frustrated and drop (73:00 - 73:03)
out the people who are left will have (73:01 - 73:05)
better experiences (73:03 - 73:07)
because the people who don't know what (73:05 - 73:08)
they're doing stop playing and you're (73:07 - 73:11)
left with people who do know what (73:08 - 73:13)
they're doing and so (73:11 - 73:16)
sort of a natural weird attrition of (73:13 - 73:18)
game life is (73:16 - 73:20)
you know once people hit credits and (73:18 - 73:21)
they don't they try a couple rates and (73:20 - 73:23)
they don't like it anymore they go away (73:21 - 73:24)
the people who are left people are like (73:23 - 73:26)
oh they're brilliant I always have a (73:24 - 73:29)
great time and without sort of thinking (73:26 - 73:31)
about there's a huge swath of the (73:29 - 73:33)
audience that got turned off and left (73:31 - 73:36)
and you are reaping the benefit of that (73:33 - 73:38)
action but that isn't great for the (73:36 - 73:42)
game's lifespan or Word of Mouth for the (73:38 - 73:45)
game you are having better raids true (73:42 - 73:48)
but that doesn't necessarily equate a (73:45 - 73:50)
positive for the game itself this is (73:48 - 73:52)
this is the destiny slash Final Fantasy (73:50 - 73:54)
thing of if you play on Tuesday nights (73:52 - 73:56)
you will have a better experience (73:54 - 73:59)
wonderful time versus if you play on (73:56 - 74:01)
Friday Saturday nights where all the (73:59 - 74:04)
good people have already done it for the (74:01 - 74:05)
week (74:04 - 74:07)
and all the like (74:05 - 74:10)
well maybe not there are there would be (74:07 - 74:11)
good people it's just maybe some people (74:10 - 74:14)
some people prioritize Tuesday nights (74:11 - 74:17)
because that is the night and then those (74:14 - 74:19)
people are out for the week (74:17 - 74:22)
so you get kind of the (74:19 - 74:23)
the (74:22 - 74:25)
workforce people who didn't have time (74:23 - 74:27)
but then also the people who like don't (74:25 - 74:29)
prioritize (74:27 - 74:31)
it's it's just a video game thing that's (74:29 - 74:34)
not necessarily a Pokemon specific issue (74:31 - 74:35)
that's just like a video game time yeah (74:34 - 74:38)
this is a video game like like Thursday (74:35 - 74:39)
raid nights (74:38 - 74:40)
for (74:39 - 74:43)
these Seven Star raids are so much more (74:40 - 74:46)
popular than the Friday night or than (74:43 - 74:49)
the the next week because people want to (74:46 - 74:50)
do it (74:49 - 74:53)
when it drops it's new they want to they (74:50 - 74:55)
want to experience it right away (74:53 - 74:58)
um speaking of experience things things (74:55 - 75:01)
uh the global challenge two is announced (74:58 - 75:06)
and very quickly uh they are doing okay (75:01 - 75:10)
so for it we said this last week uh that (75:06 - 75:12)
these events are coming way too quick (75:10 - 75:14)
and not only are they coming way too (75:12 - 75:17)
quick they are on top of each other yeah (75:14 - 75:20)
we had three events we had a ditto event (75:17 - 75:22)
a global challenge event and a seven (75:20 - 75:24)
star raid event all in the same weekend (75:22 - 75:29)
and that is only for one Pokemon game (75:24 - 75:29)
and here's the thing (75:29 - 75:34)
a lot of people pick and choose right (75:31 - 75:35)
like (75:34 - 75:37)
for people who are super fans this is a (75:35 - 75:39)
thing because we want to do them all (75:37 - 75:42)
like this is kind of a Superman super (75:39 - 75:44)
fan Complete because like I have three (75:42 - 75:45)
things to do and it's way on top of each (75:44 - 75:47)
other where a lot of people are like I (75:45 - 75:48)
only care about one of these and so it's (75:47 - 75:50)
fun and I don't want to wait yeah months (75:48 - 75:53)
between things like this is a fan (75:50 - 75:55)
complaint so like (75:53 - 75:59)
we get it but for super fans (75:55 - 76:02)
this is exhausting right like this is (75:59 - 76:05)
like come on I I wanted to help more (76:02 - 76:07)
people with Samurai because I like I (76:05 - 76:09)
don't need Samurai I like helping people (76:07 - 76:11)
get Samurai there was plenty of people (76:09 - 76:12)
who struggle with Samurai I wanted to (76:11 - 76:14)
help people against Samurai I spent (76:12 - 76:16)
seven hours in the global challenge 30 (76:14 - 76:20)
matches my brain was melted on the (76:16 - 76:22)
sidewalk and fried like battling is so (76:20 - 76:28)
mentally exhausting uh that like and of (76:22 - 76:29)
course you know some of your matches go (76:28 - 76:31)
along right you might play against (76:29 - 76:33)
dondoza you might play against a stall (76:31 - 76:35)
it's like (76:33 - 76:36)
30 matches in seven hours and that's (76:35 - 76:38)
like trying to like take breaks in (76:36 - 76:40)
between because I don't want to Brute (76:38 - 76:41)
Force matches and be like I lost next (76:40 - 76:44)
match lost next match lost like (76:41 - 76:45)
if I'm just doing that I'm not getting (76:44 - 76:47)
any better because I'm not reflecting on (76:45 - 76:49)
what I could have done better so I like (76:47 - 76:50)
to take like five minutes after every (76:49 - 76:51)
match (76:50 - 76:53)
but if you don't care about the global (76:51 - 76:55)
challenge you were like I don't know the (76:53 - 76:56)
weekend seemed fine I did some Dittos (76:55 - 76:58)
and but like (76:56 - 77:00)
there was there was plenty to do if you (76:58 - 77:02)
only cared about one of the things there (77:00 - 77:04)
was too much to do if you cared about (77:02 - 77:06)
all of the things yes (77:04 - 77:09)
um but the global challenge too is this (77:06 - 77:11)
upcoming week (77:09 - 77:14)
uh if you would like a exclusive item (77:11 - 77:18)
you can get the great ball backpack by (77:14 - 77:22)
do you have three matches uh win or lose (77:18 - 77:25)
so if you're not a battler you can bring (77:22 - 77:29)
in a Voltorb an electrode a gargoyle (77:25 - 77:33)
um I'm listing things that all explode (77:29 - 77:36)
you can just go in and hit explosion and (77:33 - 77:38)
then be done with it (77:36 - 77:41)
that will be a very quick match (77:38 - 77:44)
that'll be exclusive quiz it goes (77:41 - 77:49)
um you have to sign up before the (77:44 - 77:51)
tournament once the tournament starts (77:49 - 77:54)
you can no longer sign up uh (77:51 - 77:56)
when you do sign up it does lock your (77:54 - 77:59)
team so pick your exploders beforehand (77:56 - 78:01)
it will lock them (77:59 - 78:03)
this is the great ball backpack (78:01 - 78:05)
um they did six Global challenges from (78:03 - 78:07)
what I remembered in (78:05 - 78:09)
sword and shield (78:07 - 78:12)
they or maybe not necessarily Global (78:09 - 78:14)
challenges but like big bigger (78:12 - 78:15)
tournaments that (78:14 - 78:18)
counted somewhere not for Americans it'd (78:15 - 78:19)
usually counted for Japanese players or (78:18 - 78:21)
Korean players but (78:19 - 78:24)
the first three were the ball guy shirts (78:21 - 78:25)
so (78:24 - 78:28)
Pokeball great ball Ultra Ball and then (78:25 - 78:31)
the next three were the shiny legendary (78:28 - 78:33)
galarian Pokemon (78:31 - 78:36)
Zapdos Articuno Moltres (78:33 - 78:38)
so safe to say we'll probably get an (78:36 - 78:41)
Ultra Ball backpack after this and then (78:38 - 78:43)
safe to say there will probably be (78:41 - 78:45)
some in the future (78:43 - 78:49)
uh something for some sort of shiny I (78:45 - 78:50)
don't know what shiny Legend they would (78:49 - 78:52)
do I guess they could do like a four (78:50 - 78:54)
pack and then do like the runes that (78:52 - 78:55)
would probably be that would make sense (78:54 - 78:56)
because the ruins are so competitive (78:55 - 78:57)
yeah (78:56 - 78:59)
um it doesn't have to necessarily be (78:57 - 79:01)
like stop at three they could go to four (78:59 - 79:04)
or five there was (79:01 - 79:07)
there was a gap between the packs and (79:04 - 79:09)
the (79:07 - 79:09)
shinies wasn't there in between I (79:10 - 79:17)
believe they were doing the um (79:13 - 79:17)
the oh what is it called The Players cup (79:17 - 79:22)
stuff because I have a feeling because (79:20 - 79:24)
the gallerian birds weren't introduced (79:22 - 79:26)
to the DLC so if they're going to follow (79:24 - 79:28)
a similar pattern it may be the three (79:26 - 79:31)
the monkey the bird and the dog that (79:28 - 79:33)
were introduced in the DLC yeah yeah you (79:31 - 79:35)
might get shiny versions of those that's (79:33 - 79:37)
the only like I was trying to go through (79:35 - 79:39)
like matching up and that's the only (79:37 - 79:41)
thing that I think well we're getting a (79:39 - 79:42)
set of three (79:41 - 79:45)
and that matches so maybe they would do (79:42 - 79:47)
that it's hard to follow sword and (79:45 - 79:49)
shield VGC because there was a pandemic (79:47 - 79:52)
the entire time yeah so we didn't have (79:49 - 79:53)
like this world tournament to like (79:52 - 79:55)
solidify that like we're moving to the (79:53 - 79:58)
next format right like so if you look at (79:55 - 80:00)
like past things it was like X and Y (79:58 - 80:02)
format and then the next year Omega Ruby (80:00 - 80:03)
Alpha Sapphire so it was like that (80:02 - 80:04)
format and then the next year it was sun (80:03 - 80:06)
and moon and then Ultra sun and moon and (80:04 - 80:07)
then we had another year of ultra sun (80:06 - 80:09)
and moon only because let's go Pikachu (80:07 - 80:11)
let's go Evie didn't have competitive (80:09 - 80:13)
but we had three years of competitive (80:11 - 80:15)
and sword and shield but we only had one (80:13 - 80:18)
world championship right (80:15 - 80:20)
um (80:18 - 80:23)
so I I would assume that the like word (80:20 - 80:26)
and regulations C right now which is (80:23 - 80:28)
um all Pokemon can be used except for (80:26 - 80:30)
miraidon and corridon (80:28 - 80:33)
and then I would assume that a future (80:30 - 80:36)
regulation would be everything we have (80:33 - 80:40)
currently plus hissuian Pokemon which I (80:36 - 80:41)
think the one that stands out is (80:40 - 80:44)
probably ursuluna as being a competitive (80:41 - 80:45)
threat (80:44 - 80:47)
and then I don't know if that brings us (80:45 - 80:48)
to (80:47 - 80:52)
DLC but then that would be like all the (80:48 - 80:55)
Pokemon plus DLC Pokemon (80:52 - 80:57)
and then that would bring us to the next (80:55 - 80:59)
DLC which would be all those Pokemon (80:57 - 81:01)
plus those DLC Pokemon and then that (80:59 - 81:04)
should bring us to (81:01 - 81:04)
legendaries (81:04 - 81:10)
added but not box legendaries that would (81:07 - 81:14)
be a future format after that and then (81:10 - 81:15)
when the Box legendaries would be (81:14 - 81:19)
allowed that's when Corydon and miraidon (81:15 - 81:23)
would be allowed which (81:19 - 81:23)
both seem very good in their own ways (81:24 - 81:29)
um I don't know if corridon really (81:27 - 81:33)
replaces Groudon as a better Pokemon I (81:29 - 81:36)
think Groudon and Kyogre are still very (81:33 - 81:39)
dominant because of what they do yeah my (81:36 - 81:41)
ride on seems very very good though uh (81:39 - 81:43)
so I think my ride on maybe who knows I (81:41 - 81:45)
mean (81:43 - 81:49)
poor zamasenta one of the worst box (81:45 - 81:52)
legendaries ever made and (81:49 - 81:54)
you know good for everyone who bought (81:52 - 81:57)
Pokemon Sword which had literally the (81:54 - 81:58)
best (81:57 - 82:02)
box legendary ever made (81:58 - 82:02)
um (82:02 - 82:05)
yeah so the the global challenges this (82:03 - 82:07)
weekend if you want a backpack uh they (82:05 - 82:10)
also there was the euic this past (82:07 - 82:11)
weekend (82:10 - 82:15)
uh and they gave away Gavin Michaels I (82:11 - 82:16)
think his name was they gave away his (82:15 - 82:18)
palathon (82:16 - 82:22)
uh which they won the oceanic (82:18 - 82:23)
championship (82:22 - 82:25)
so I'm not as of this recording I (82:23 - 82:28)
actually don't know who won but ideally (82:25 - 82:29)
who won (82:28 - 82:33)
minus Rune Pokemon and minus usually (82:29 - 82:36)
starter Pokemon (82:33 - 82:39)
they'll take whatever that is and that (82:36 - 82:43)
winner will be for ni NAIC the North (82:39 - 82:45)
American for that distribution so the (82:43 - 82:48)
the first winner was a gargonacle so we (82:45 - 82:50)
got a gargo knuckle and then we got a (82:48 - 82:51)
palafin (82:50 - 82:54)
and then who knows what we'll get (82:51 - 82:56)
fortunately enough gastrodon is not good (82:54 - 82:59)
in this format because they removed (82:56 - 83:01)
scald from it so I think we've gotten (82:59 - 83:04)
like four or five champion gastrodons at (83:01 - 83:06)
some point over the years and I think (83:04 - 83:09)
we've got right two or three amonguses (83:06 - 83:11)
as it turns out a Mungus is still very (83:09 - 83:14)
good and I think Gavin had an amungus on (83:11 - 83:16)
his team so it was either a monkey sir (83:14 - 83:19)
palafin and thank goodness we got the (83:16 - 83:20)
palace (83:19 - 83:23)
uh (83:20 - 83:25)
cause I I don't know uh I don't know (83:23 - 83:27)
what's looking good I don't I don't (83:25 - 83:28)
think they would do Paradox either (83:27 - 83:29)
because I don't think they've ever done (83:28 - 83:30)
like (83:29 - 83:31)
that the Paradox are similar to ultra (83:30 - 83:33)
beasts whereas like if an ultra beast on (83:31 - 83:35)
the T was on the team it like kind of (83:33 - 83:37)
like disqualified itself from being a (83:35 - 83:39)
distribution or whatever I don't know (83:37 - 83:41)
what weird rules they do but (83:39 - 83:43)
I guess we'll have to see who the winner (83:41 - 83:44)
is (83:43 - 83:45)
um (83:44 - 83:49)
finally last bit of news (83:45 - 83:51)
they showed a new Pokemon off (83:49 - 83:55)
they did yep (83:51 - 83:58)
well we don't know a hundred percent for (83:55 - 84:01)
sure that it was a new Pokemon we know (83:58 - 84:04)
that it's not a Pokemon form at least (84:01 - 84:06)
that we have seen before (84:04 - 84:08)
yeah do you (84:06 - 84:11)
want to talk about what it looks like (84:08 - 84:12)
and (84:11 - 84:14)
it looks like a little tiny baby (84:12 - 84:18)
tropagos it's adorable it's a little (84:14 - 84:19)
tiny turtle (84:18 - 84:21)
um (84:19 - 84:24)
it's and there's speculation about (84:21 - 84:26)
whether it's a cosmog situation or about (84:24 - 84:29)
whether this is just a whole different (84:26 - 84:33)
form of tarapagos before it (84:29 - 84:35)
there's some speculation that in the DLC (84:33 - 84:37)
there will be (84:35 - 84:39)
terrestrialized forms (84:37 - 84:41)
so actually visibly different Pokemon (84:39 - 84:43)
when they're drasticized and so there is (84:41 - 84:47)
some speculation that yeah tarapagos is (84:43 - 84:49)
that form of this Pokemon that we have (84:47 - 84:51)
just seen in the anime (84:49 - 84:55)
so like uh yeah like giganza Max first (84:51 - 85:00)
yeah yeah yeah that kind of thing I mean (84:55 - 85:00)
the speculation (85:01 - 85:07)
none of this is confirmed (85:03 - 85:10)
it's fun to speculate yes as long as you (85:07 - 85:13)
set your expectations (85:10 - 85:17)
properly yes the amount of people who (85:13 - 85:20)
sit there and speculate about things and (85:17 - 85:22)
then get mad (85:20 - 85:24)
at a company (85:22 - 85:27)
because what they dreamed up didn't come (85:24 - 85:32)
true that's on you you made a thing up (85:27 - 85:35)
and got excited for a thing that wasn't (85:32 - 85:38)
real but the but you but the YouTubers (85:35 - 85:41)
told me that yeah I was going to come (85:38 - 85:43)
out on Virtual Console on Pokemon day (85:41 - 85:46)
all the YouTubers told me that Greg (85:43 - 85:49)
setting you up they they said they had (85:46 - 85:52)
sources with no proof of those sources (85:49 - 85:56)
yeah I I love speculating like it's fun (85:52 - 86:00)
it's fun to think what if but I know not (85:56 - 86:04)
to buy into my own imagination yes (86:00 - 86:07)
and make it be upset at a product that (86:04 - 86:09)
doesn't meet what my imagination wanted (86:07 - 86:11)
it to be and this is not a Pokemon (86:09 - 86:15)
problem this is an everything problem (86:11 - 86:18)
um Greg pointed to a Star Wars object (86:15 - 86:20)
for our audio listeners (86:18 - 86:21)
uh (86:20 - 86:23)
uh but just (86:21 - 86:28)
have fun speculating but do the world of (86:23 - 86:29)
favor (86:28 - 86:32)
and keep your expectations in hype at a (86:29 - 86:35)
manageable level it's a cute Pokemon we (86:32 - 86:38)
don't know how they're related this is (86:35 - 86:41)
the amola mola love disc thing this is (86:38 - 86:44)
the Tauros buffalet thing it turns out (86:41 - 86:47)
they were never connected (86:44 - 86:49)
um (86:47 - 86:49)
well they're technically connected I (86:49 - 86:55)
guess yeah but like (86:52 - 86:59)
this is a thing that we will find out (86:55 - 87:04)
and have fun speculating but don't don't (86:59 - 87:08)
be the person that gets mad and will go (87:04 - 87:10)
online to Screech about they were (87:08 - 87:13)
promised XYZ you weren't you saw one (87:10 - 87:16)
thing oh we only got X and Y you yeah (87:13 - 87:18)
you never got that it's so much fun to (87:16 - 87:20)
speculate about right now because the (87:18 - 87:23)
the anime is showing us things about (87:20 - 87:25)
this story that we haven't seen yet (87:23 - 87:27)
correct and we know that is this the (87:25 - 87:30)
second episode of the anime or the first (87:27 - 87:32)
I don't know I haven't been watching (87:30 - 87:33)
them because I only watch them when (87:32 - 87:35)
they're out in English and they're not I (87:33 - 87:37)
think well yeah that's part of the (87:35 - 87:39)
problem this is the second I think it's (87:37 - 87:43)
the second episode I think so (87:39 - 87:45)
but uh IGN is saying it was the first (87:43 - 87:47)
episode and they compared it to Ho-Oh (87:45 - 87:49)
yeah there were some people saying oh (87:47 - 87:51)
that it's really exciting because the (87:49 - 87:54)
anime is showing us a Pokemon or a (87:51 - 87:56)
Pokemon form or a Pokemon Paradox that (87:54 - 87:58)
we haven't seen yet we don't know we (87:56 - 88:00)
don't know what this is and it's really (87:58 - 88:03)
cool but also it's only been aired in (88:00 - 88:04)
Japan so far (88:03 - 88:06)
ha (88:04 - 88:10)
and we won't get it till 2024. gosh I (88:06 - 88:14)
hate this we're lucky I I I hate I hate (88:10 - 88:18)
that like games are now worldwide we get (88:14 - 88:19)
this really we get this release schedule (88:18 - 88:22)
and that's really great because I (88:19 - 88:24)
actually uh we talked about how black (88:22 - 88:26)
and white was like eight months early in (88:24 - 88:28)
Japan and so it was like weird as an (88:26 - 88:30)
American looking at all these black and (88:28 - 88:32)
white Pokemon and not really knowing (88:30 - 88:35)
what they did and yeah and like waiting (88:32 - 88:37)
for it and then get everyone getting all (88:35 - 88:39)
the Pokemon at once and X and Y was like (88:37 - 88:41)
such a blessing minus the people who (88:39 - 88:43)
leaked it early and now it's like we got (88:41 - 88:45)
a new Pokemon (88:43 - 88:47)
in an anime that has started in Japan (88:45 - 88:51)
when we in America haven't even seen (88:47 - 88:54)
Ashwin yet right (88:51 - 88:57)
it's again it's frustrating it's (88:54 - 88:59)
frustrating that they don't do simulink (88:57 - 89:01)
asked (88:59 - 89:03)
somebody made a good point that uh in (89:01 - 89:05)
our YouTube uh that it was probably TV (89:03 - 89:07)
Tokyo is the reason why and they have an (89:05 - 89:12)
exclusive contract where they get first (89:07 - 89:15)
rights to airing for x amount of days (89:12 - 89:15)
yeah but also contracts can be (89:18 - 89:23)
renegotiated and are renegotiated on a (89:20 - 89:25)
fairly regular basis (89:23 - 89:27)
so (89:25 - 89:30)
we are just saying the contract that you (89:27 - 89:32)
are currently in is hurting your (89:30 - 89:34)
audience and you need to renegotiate (89:32 - 89:35)
your contract and if they're going to (89:34 - 89:36)
keep doing (89:35 - 89:38)
May that are big (89:36 - 89:41)
s if Ash is going to win or if Ash is (89:38 - 89:42)
going to leave or if they're going to (89:41 - 89:45)
introduce a new Pokemon it's so much (89:42 - 89:47)
better it's for everybody to be able to (89:45 - 89:49)
see it yeah (89:47 - 89:50)
it's like (89:49 - 89:54)
people will come in (89:50 - 89:54)
and be like did you see this on the (89:54 - 89:57)
anime and I was like oh we just dropped (89:56 - 89:59)
in anime spoilers but at the same time (89:57 - 90:02)
it's like how do you avoid a brand new (89:59 - 90:05)
Pokemon like you can't (90:02 - 90:08)
and like I want to experience this anime (90:05 - 90:09)
fresh (90:08 - 90:11)
and it is very exciting there is a new (90:09 - 90:13)
turtle here I'm looking at I don't know (90:11 - 90:16)
what happens in the episode uh I but (90:13 - 90:18)
like I'm excited that the anime is going (90:16 - 90:21)
to go into this whole storyline that I (90:18 - 90:23)
have been very invested in for paldea (90:21 - 90:25)
but because the games probably are cool (90:23 - 90:27)
no I think they will I think they will (90:25 - 90:31)
in the second DLC (90:27 - 90:31)
[Music] (90:31 - 90:35)
the games went into a fair amount of it (90:33 - 90:38)
there's just much yet to be uncovered (90:35 - 90:40)
and if the DLC and the anime both go (90:38 - 90:43)
into it I am happy (90:40 - 90:43)
yeah (90:45 - 90:48)
um (90:46 - 90:48)
but uh turtle looks cool (90:49 - 90:53)
it's very cute it's cute (90:51 - 90:56)
no idea how big tarapagos itself is (90:53 - 90:57)
going to be but this thing is like (90:56 - 90:59)
Pikachu sized (90:57 - 91:02)
yeah I liked I think I like how tarapa (90:59 - 91:04)
ghost looks more than I like how this (91:02 - 91:05)
looks (91:04 - 91:07)
that's fair (91:05 - 91:09)
like Amara he looks he looks naked (91:07 - 91:11)
because he has like these weird long (91:09 - 91:13)
turtle turtles don't have that long of (91:11 - 91:17)
legs some do some do what are you (91:13 - 91:19)
talking about he just like looks like (91:17 - 91:22)
there's more skin than shell it's really (91:19 - 91:24)
throwing me off in the turtle in the (91:22 - 91:26)
turtle world (91:24 - 91:26)
fat skin to Shell proportion (91:28 - 91:33)
uh (91:37 - 91:41)
uh we still don't know if likos is Ash's (91:38 - 91:44)
daughter so that's true or or mother or (91:41 - 91:48)
girlfriend or sister I mean there's a (91:44 - 91:50)
lot of questions we don't have Greg stop (91:48 - 91:53)
speculating keep that in check please (91:50 - 91:55)
all right (91:53 - 91:58)
come on I mean I'm gonna Riot if if Ash (91:55 - 92:00)
isn't somebody's parent in this the (91:58 - 92:04)
whole thing is coming Crashing Down (92:00 - 92:04)
well that's our episode for you guys we (92:05 - 92:09)
made it 90 minutes that's our threshold (92:07 - 92:11)
I'm I could keep going on about seven (92:09 - 92:13)
star raids for the record (92:11 - 92:15)
I do really like seven star raids I (92:13 - 92:17)
think they're absolutely fantastic (92:15 - 92:19)

Insurance Commissioners to have their (92:47 - 92:52)
convention (92:49 - 92:52)

I mean that's that'd be that's what (92:56 - 92:59)
you're gonna get (92:58 - 93:02)
I I can't I can't tell what's worse at (92:59 - 93:04)
this point Ohio or Indiana they're both (93:02 - 93:06)
pretty bad Indiana (93:04 - 93:09)
[Laughter] (93:06 - 93:13)
anyways I'll be at Nic that's exciting (93:09 - 93:14)

though but between watching the oceanic (93:14 - 93:21)
tournament and the euic (93:18 - 93:25)
in London it looks like they have put a (93:21 - 93:27)
lot more (93:25 - 93:31)
effort and spectacle in there (93:27 - 93:32)
uh (93:31 - 93:35)
I don't know what national National (93:32 - 93:36)
tournaments I guess they're they're (93:35 - 93:38)
typically yeah they're big events (93:36 - 93:41)
they're big events the European (93:38 - 93:45)
International seemed on par with worlds (93:41 - 93:48)
