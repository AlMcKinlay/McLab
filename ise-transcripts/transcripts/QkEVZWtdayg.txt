[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 270 seventh episode of the Pokemon podcast it's super effective I'm your host SBJ and with me today is will yeah and I think I'm under the realization that the the hour of 4:00 a.m. and the age of 44 are yet not compatible I should never see that hour with my open eyes we we both had late nights but we were we were not together that's true I actually think when I woke up at 6:30 you're like you had just texted me or something and you're like yeah I just got home yeah yeah so we're we're recording this no Travis uh just because of this weird recording schedule I just got back from the Minnesota polka con just a bit ago I mean I mean I got home at like it was probably like five ish a.m. before I climbed into bed it's like 4 p.m. now so I slept for like 10 hours because I didn't sleep at all during that convention and then so how long when did you get there because you you don't live in Minnesota for those that I don't know hopes who don't know yeah so the Minnesota polka con was in st. Louis Park Minnesota if I'm not mistaken I could prob maybe I'm getting the city wrong but around st. Louis Park Minnesota and they invited my they invited us out about two weeks ago so very last-minute on on their part and my part and I was like okay I can at least do Saturday if that's okay with you guys and they said sure and they were like we'll give you a booth at a table or a booth in Taylor the same thing but we'll give you a booth and we'll give you a panel that's like cool great I mean it's a it's like a six-hour drive for me and Michael is like oh I'd love to go with and Greg from mythical mythical he lives near st. Louis Park so it's very easy commute for him giving giving away people's locations anyways so my god Mike and I left Friday at about 11 a.m. and we have that we haven't taken my cash err a hotel room no so Irene's brother also lives in st. Louis Park Wow I originally was going to book a hotel room but Irene was like just text my brother so I did and they're like oh of course you can stay with us so and they have two guest bedrooms believe it or not Wow I know it's C R if it was were very fancy and so we stayed with them and that was a huge help with just cost of getting there and arranging everything and so we get in around 6 p.m. ish not actually was clip maybe closer to 7:00 we meet up with Greg right away we go to the the hotel where it was taking place it was the Doubletree and like I said I think it's st. Louis Park so we went to the Doubletree in st. Louis Park walked around we met everyone we met people from the decks and we met the person who created Pokemon showdown like the programmer person the programmer person they also live in or around st. Louis Park who knew so I guess the st. Louis Park is is really near Minneapolis right yes so Minneapolis is the hub of Pokemon culture in the United States of America is what we're determining I mean the person who runs the event said that the Pokemon scene isn't strong in Minnesota I'm not sure if that's like true or not I mean I don't live there so I'll take their word on it but their goal with the Minnesota polka cotton is to you know restore that and bring that up and make that you know a more popular thing so we met with all those guys and they were they were having like a staff slash group dinner I was like hey guys it was super nice to meet all you I'm gonna spend the entire day with you guys tomorrow I would love to see my friends that also live in st. Louis Park my friend Alex and his girlfriend Katie I was like I see them like twice a year so I will see you guys all tomorrow but I'm gonna cook at dinner with them that's reasonable yeah I think so so we got dinner with with my friends then Mike and I attempted to do the splatfest we was a complete disaster because the as nice as my my Irene's brothers house is it's like a dead spot for 18 t so I couldn't tell oh wow like I could I could I could lo Twitter and everything just fine it just wasn't strong enough to play an online game on your Nintendo switch that you could portably take with you to direct in the pre first world problems right there Micah had a Verizon hot spot so we paid the $35 for like two gigs of data and we played like 10 matches a splatfest it was like 3:00 a.m. and then we had to get ready for the con which started at 10:00 we went to the conned at 10:00 and there was a couple issues I know you probably have questions will but the the main issue that happened was the registration portal didn't work so for my understanding they couldn't actually pull up who registered and who didn't register so they I got that resolved around 11:30 wait wait wait wait wait so they didn't use I'm not gonna say Ticketmaster because that would be foolish for them to use but they didn't use Eventbrite no I don't think so hey hey folks just FYI event brights already done all the work for you just use Eventbrite alright not not a sponsored the program but not yeah will anderson gold-certified recommendation right there not yet I actually think I could be wrong but I'm pretty sure I heard I can't remember his name I'm apologized but the creator of showdown I'm pretty sure helped program the Minnesota Polka Khan website out here I mean clearly the dude knows how to program he made Pokemon yeah but registration had some issues what was supposed to happen is it was supposed to open at 10:00 and then opening ceremonies was supposed to be a 10:30 people started pouring in around 11:30 and then the opening ceremonies was at 12:00 and when we got in we got in at like 9:30 because I was like I don't need I don't need like an hour two hours to set up my table I've done so many cons in the past packs mgc yeah you pretty much just have like a booth in a box at this point I D I literally do have a booth in a box yes and I drove so I was very limited in what I could bring like I could probably could have brought more stuff but I was like I'm just gonna bring my one box you know go from there what was really cool is so we we were one of the first people to set up a table so this is it was organized like when you walk in there's just really wide hallway and it was really long and that's where all the either featured guests were or sponsors like sprint was there because Sprint is a sponsor of Pokemon go so I assume that the poky con worked with them and said hey we're gonna poke my people here your sprint your big part Pokemon go just like something it was like sprint was there we set up in the hallway and then at the end of the hallway was the main hall where they would do opening ceremonies in the concert and then next to that was the vendor slash artists room and then mid look right when you walk in there was two rooms four panels and then in the middle of this long hallway on either side one room was dedicated to showing Pokemon movies and then across from that was like the game room where people were either doing the video game or the TCG or they just had like pokemon monopoly or Pokemon adventure quest to be a master or event request that really old board game so that was you know pretty much the whole like floor plan of the con it was easily the smallest kind I've been to but it was so I was gonna say how many how many people would you say total just Saturday cuz again the con was both Saturday and Sunday I would say that about two to three hundred people poured in right away around the the opening first opening two hours and then throughout the day new people were coming in but also people were leaving and then coming back I'm assuming that a lot of people were staying in the hotel so it was like okay we saw this stuff but we're gonna you know go back to our hotel room or go get something come back for a panel I think they were expected five hundred people so I would I I'm pretty confident they'd probably hit that especially with Sunday all right Pisan yeah five hundred people's decent I mean if five hundred people who love Pokemon which is pretty cool what was even cooler will is I we set up the table and I like left to I went back to my car to get some more stuff and when I came back Professor Oak set up their table next to us so like the actual professor oak the the og the original voice actor for professor oak for the first nine years of the anime that's cool either so they soon actually had some real like people from from the Pokemon world there yeah I got him to get getting there to the the middle of America which people like us me from the coast don't like to believe exists but sure so they had they had the original voice actor Professor Oak's Stewart something Patrick Stewart yes Patrick Stewart was the original voice actor they had Jason Page who was the singer of the original Pokemon theme song oh wow the I want to be the very best that song that's a pretty it's almost a Bop not not quite I'm trying to pick up the new lingo I heard that on a different podcast so you refer to as a Bob yeah the Bob yeah it's it's a Yuri ah nice as a Bop supposedly I think it's about and that's what that's what qualifies right when I born I put down the BOP hammer actually no but anyways they had the Dex the YouTube channel they had us the same level of Jason page and Professor Oak's no no no I died degree a degree that we we hit that level we're more big in the community I'm just just to give you some perspective on that I was hanging out with one of Steven wise merch you chew already can and he was in DC for a conference and everybody was saying well how do you know will and I would just say I'm a famous internet personality and then then the guy who created show down and I think there was one more other person and I can't remember what they did I want to say or a programmer / author of sorts but I'm not a hundred percent sure what they did and I apologize we talked with Professor Oak such one of the nicest dudes I think I've ever talked to the ability for him to talk normal and then turn on professor oak and do like wonderful or Oh was I couldn't help but smile every single time it was just it was like the the best table location in the world to be sitting next to Professor Oak and having kids and fans come up and then him just turning on the oak voice and like seeing those people just light up it was just a really unreal experience I got some I got a little bit of dirt on on why professor oak is no longer Professor Oak uh-oh so and this is gonna spill the tea this also applies to I think Jason page but I that's that's more of a different story but for professor oak them and the original Kasich's of Veronica Taylor and the people who the guy who played Brock and the guy who played like James and stuff they were hired by 4kids media you remember for kids the logos yeah came at the end of the episodes with the number four and then the word kids after it yes four kids so they were all hired by four kids to do the Pokemon anime and obviously what ash voices yes and obviously when they started doing that they didn't realize that it was going to be so big and and whatnot they had I think originally an eight-year contract and so at the end of eight year eight years it just turned into you know contract will just keep paying for you and and whatnot well you have an eight year commitment and then option to renew year to year or something like that yes sir within that year they were working on a new contract for four kids and another company I can't remember what it was called but it was the it when they started doing the hoenn stuff because obviously that's one out and the animation quality changed and boys started changing if I'm not mistaken you know it happens to a lot of adolescents but yes so another company came in and under bidded for kids and so Nintendo and the Pokemon company decided to go with that other company because it was cheaper so because that new company wasn't for kids media and for kids media technically was in charge of these voice actors all those voice actors under the original anime were pretty much fired because the new company couldn't just hire them because they were under contract with four kids well I mean hmm you think they'd have an opportunity to get their contracts cancelled and transferred or something like that but if if that company wanted to save money then probably they felt that they'd be able to do it cheaper with new voice talent I'm sure it's something along those lines I mean they they ended up doing the show awfully yeah yeah I think I asked if if like TCP I are in attend to every reached out after that fact because like right obviously that now it's been like eleven more years and Professor Oak is an under contract with four kids anymore he said that he did one or two other things with Pokemon after the fact like they just randomly called him up uh yeah have you heard of a game called Pokemon snap was the first ten years yeah no it was yeah yeah they randomly called him up they he did a couple things and then that's that's been that so he hasn't done anything since since that I asked if there was any word if he was doing the 20th anniversary movie since that's you know based on the first couple episodes of the anime plus true a new twist and he said he didn't even know they were doing a new movie and they weren't doing a movie that was a throwback movie so he was like I'm actually going to try to call them and ask who they're voicing for Professor Oak he like he like started looking it up right away phone like he was very like I want to do this which is cut it was really cool but I don't I don't know if that sounds so weird what sounds word that he'll I mean it's it's it's if it's gonna be in theaters in November I'm great well that was one of my questions was was like how long does it take for because the movies done if it movies done English people come in do the lines make the movie in English he said he wasn't sure but they would have to start pretty soon to get done by November but he said it was doable so I don't know I mean I I mean like I hope you didn't start trouble I hope you didn't start a battle in the Pokemon world I don't know who plays Professor Oak right now well Samson oak or original oak is that I think it's the same voice actor for both and tensions the illusion a little inversion right yeah yeah I I would assume that they're probably gonna do the people that are doing the TV show right now right like who I I don't know the name of the woman who plays Ashe currently but it would be really weird to be like here's the new movie you're not gonna do it we're gonna bring back this oil old voice actor which you know some people love I think Veronica Taylor is great but I also think the new ash is great yeah I think that that's a decent voice that they have so I yeah I don't know how that works I feel like bringing back old voice actors is stepping on the toes of the current voice actors that's true and it becomes like it's like disruptive when you expect to hear one particular voice and you hear a different voice even if it was the original voice you're kind of used to hearing the new voice and you see what I'm saying totally I do have any more questions about this book again you gave a panel that way what was your panel what had that but oh wait we're gonna hear it aren't we yeah so I'm going to include the panel in in the later half of this episode it's actually only about a half hour long how many people came so each panel was a hundred seats I would want to say about 30 or 40 people came out all right because I actually when you said there are about 500 people at the con I was like at PAX East we had like 300 400 people in the room yes it's like did you just like completely draw everybody that was at the con into your panel well here's here's the problem with our panel it was at 7:00 p.m. ooh that's a deadly hour it's a very deadly hour because either people are done for the day or they're done for the day because they probably went to dinner at 5 or 6 p.m. and they probably don't want to come back to the con yeah yeah the other problem or fantastic internet personalities like yourself yeah well they're there every I'm pretty sure we had probably about 10 to 12 groups and I say groups because it was usually one or more person come up and say they listen to the show and they love it and I only say groups because I the other person is smiling and nodding their heads and one other only one person is doing all the talking so I'm not sure if the person not talking is a listener or not or just as like yeah yeah my significant other my friend can listens to you but I don't I'm just smiling and nodding my friend is one of them just like completely obsessed ISE fans you know yes correct so all the people that specifically came up to our panel or to our booth and said they listen to us they did they were all at the panel so that was that was awesome and I think there was a couple people that were like we drove two hours to get here or people made commitments to come and that's just very very flattering how many of them were disappointed that I wasn't there ah I think no one was because I think we did a good job at communicating that you weren't going to be there that's true but every one that came up was super nice I think Greg makes a good ten percent will form so yeah this is this is that specific to this is not specific to pokey can like I said I've been to a lot of conventions people will come up they will start talking there was stopped talking with me and I they'll pick up a business card and I'll usually go into my pitch of what you know why I'm there which is so we're a Pokemon podcast called it's super fective we do a weekly show every single Monday which is an iTunes Google Play SoundCloud etc and so just to let you know we talk about the TCG the anime the video game the magic harp jump Pokemon go etc and then after all of that I usually go do you listen to any podcasts and so I do this deal with pretty much anyone who you know picks up the business card every now and then after I'm done with the spiel people some people will go oh I know I already listened to you guys but they don't like start off with that which is really funny I think they're just like hesitant to say like oh my god I listen to you guys where most people that come up to the booth that's the first thing they do is they come up and they go hi I'm so-and-so I listen to you guys every week and then they usually say who their favorite is or whatnot and so there's always like those those two types of fans the fans that will like instantly tell you they listen to you and then the fans that are really hesitant and then almost every every single time when I do my spiel that's when they admit that they listen which is just I mean it's humbling they're like look Steve I have heard your stuff look I've listened I'm only here for Mike understandable yeah the 7 o'clock hour was was kind of killer overall and it didn't so the Polka con was fun I had a blast but I don't think there was a consistent six hours of things to do so from like noon to 6 p.m. unless you were consistently doing the VGC or the TCG or watching the anime movies in the theater room or I guess going to other panels a lot of people were leaving midday and then coming back later if you if you were there all day you really had to be doing every single thing the poky con offered it offered a lot but I don't know if the initial 200 people that came through the door were committed to doing everything for the con or just coming to do specific you know what I mean yeah and you don't have to do everything at a con to enjoy the con and get your value out of it so that's cool yeah yes I am what's the next cut was that we're both going to Gen Con that's true in a week and a half mm-hmm which is not which and we're while it's not a Pokemon trip it's not a it's but it's both personal trips for us we just do this 290 Pokemon but we will be doing Pokemon there there's like a a draft release that we're participating in yeah I was gonna say well it's not a Pokemon trip it's not not a Pokemon trip yeah I would actually but we're not doing a draft pay attention to what you signed up ours loser booster filled sealed booster wheels sealed sealed deck seal deck yes so do you know how that works have you been through that before I have I applied the TCG very for a long time well yeah but this is a new format is it what's do about it okay so maybe sure this is I'm pretty sure you get eight booster packs you open them up you make a deck they give you energy cards you play three rounds and then when you're done they give you two more booster packs incorrect so this is if I if I believe I'm right this is the new format that puka has come up with you get a balk this that has like most of a deck constructed already so everybody I think they either have like one or two where everybody gets the same cards there's like two variations on it but everybody gets the same cards and then you get four packs and then you can mix those packs into that standard built deck that you got to make a final deck that's yours and then at the end you get more packs but do you keep the the do you keep the fake deck they give you yes it comes in this really nice like deck box but it's all everybody way cooler cards yeah because there's just like a base where everybody's gonna have the same cards and then it's like things that you pull from the packs become texts that you can add to your deck alright I'm done with that we should we should after the show we should compare notes make sure we're some occur in the correct draft I think we are but we should double check yes show you one more thing so we're going to Gen Con so if you are going to Gen Con don't hesitate to you know reach out to Will or myself or Micah or Irene on Twitter Travis will not be there so that Greg will be there Greg will be to you so don't hesitate to reach out Jenn cons like five days long I am more than happy to make time for everyone and then after that at the end of August I actually think it starts on September 1st but I myself and Irene will be at PAX West in Seattle and we will be doing a panel there I know I'm working to get some more guests on the panel but the J wits from YouTube / twitch the J wits we've had him on he will be on the panel which is really great I know they gave us like a 400 to 500 person room this year I guess they were like hey you guys filled that room at Boston so we're gonna up your room size that's really exciting I don't I I know the panel's on Monday I believe it's at 12:30 but don't hold me to that I'm sure I tweeted at some point we'll get you more details as we closer to that event but with that being said let's do some Pokemon news now this is just we're very light on Pokemon go this week right now Moltres is still happening in the Pokemon girl world if you can try to catch them all tree-sit ends Monday night Zapdos also starts on Monday and then we're probably gonna get nothing after Zapdos I don't think I don't think they're rotating back to Articuno I think they're actually gonna give us a break so do you know what hour of the day it switched from Articuno to Moltres I don't know what it was in other time zones but for the central time zone and for me I was still seeing Articuno at 6 p.m. all right interesting ok ok and those were like fresh Articuno like two hours left at like 6 p.m. all right so that would be for Pacific so it's after that all right this is the news I want to talk about there have been reports that indicate it is impossible to catch a raid boss with the very last premier ball so what does that mean yeah what does that mean so when you complete a raid in Pokemon go you get a set amount of premier balls all a permit a premier ball has the same catch rate in Pokemon go as a regular pokeball so if you're catching like a wild hare cross for example in Pokemon go you might want to use a great ball or an ultra ball because it increases the catch rate of course and heracross might be a harder Pokemon - catch and or a rare enough to the point where you go I don't see heracross often so I want to make sure I get it and it doesn't run away in a raid battle you don't have that option you only get premier balls and you are awarded those premier balls based on how did how well you did in the raid and what gym the raid was at so for example if you are fighting a Moltres at a Valor gym and most of the people participating in the raid are valor and valor did the most damage to Moltres you will probably get about 11 to 12 balls to use to catch mole trees now if you were mystic in that raid and it was a Valor gym with valor doing the most damage you as a mystic player might only get 5 or 6 balls to catch small treason so it is very dependent on your team and your team's contribution now what this last ball means is there have been tons of videos of people attempting to catch raid bosses with the very last pokeball and no one's been able to do it so a really good example of this is Magikarp Magikarp is the easiest raid boss to catch out of all the raid bosses that are available when you attempt to catch a Pokemon in Pokemon go there's our there's a couple factors that matter the ball choice which in a raid you don't have a choice you have to use the premier balls that give you the berries so you can give a raspberry to increase the percentage of catch or you can get I think I I want to say it's like I don't have the numbers in front of me but I want to say it increases it like like 10% or something like that III know I'm wrong but let's just for this example let's just say 10% or you could use a golden raspberry which again not exact numbers but let's say that increases the catch rate by 25% which I know is way too high but just an example so the other things that matter is if you throw a curve ball or not so if you throw a curve ball that also increases the catch rate and then the final thing that matters is the nice great or excellent if it says nice that's good but if it says great that's even better and if it says excellent that's even better so each one of those words slightly increases the chance of catching now if you take all that math together I'm going to simplify it here for Magikarp if you are fighting a rade Magikarp and you throw a curve ball with a golden raspberry and you get great or excellent you have a 99% chance to catch Magikarp following me well yes I got that science down there are tons of videos of people throwing the very last rate rate of the very last premier ball they have on to Magikarp hitting curve hitting great using the golden raspberry 99% chance will and none of them can catch it it's impossible the Magikarp always gets out of the ball and then runs away because the trainer no longer has any premier balls left you think it might be because the Magikarp is tired of getting hit in the head with balls maybe okay so now keep us in my trainers when you're doing a raid and you get to the very last premier ball at that point it's impossible you cannot catch the Pokemon that last ball will never catch you a Pokemon no matter what is what you use to attempt to catch it there is not a single video that can be found of somebody catching a pokemon with their very last pokeball premiere ball sorry so what should I do just not toss it I would one not waste a Golden Raspberry because you're not gonna catch it well so have you heard that strategy where you do a Nana B at the beginning yeah and that kind of it stays with like it fills them up so deliciously that they don't move around as much yourself I have I've only done two mulches reads the I did the Nana bit the Nana berry trick on both of them the first Moltres I didn't catch but it was it was my fault like my screen was freaking out and my finger was like slipping which my balls were just like dropping to the ground right away it was very frustrating but I got the issue what's this in the rain is that is that strike in the rain in the rain I caught the mall trees I'm like why because it was raining out and fire type moves or repost very weak that dude was at a disadvantage the trick there is what you're what people think and this is not confirmed but what people think is if you throw a than the naba bury the bananas what that berry does is it doesn't increase the catch rate but it calms the pokemon down so they they attack less often and they don't move around so it makes it very easy to at least hit them with your pokeball if if you're bad at throwing pokeballs now that is supposed to only last one turn but what people are reporting is when you use it right away it seems to last into multiple turns like multiple throws it's not as effective as the very first time you use it but it seems to have this like lasting impression but again that's not confirmed but I don't know it might be worth trying I think people in slack also said they tried it and it seems to have worked but there's no hard data on that there's no like numbers I can give you to verify but going back to one the very last premier ball doesn't catch people are chalking that up to it's saying a bug I mean if you look at the math and it's telling you that it's a 99 percent catch rate for magic carp and you see 10 different people all fail that that there's something wrong with the game oh now I agree that's that yes unless it's like only that people who exist in that 1% are the ones that are taking video their Falls failing yes which would be somewhat of an anomaly on its own so but until that's resolved I just want to let people know that if you have one ball left you're not going to catch the Pokemon so don't waste a golden raspberry or anything else just accept the fact that ball number two is technically your last ball wait now you don't get to are there people who only get three balls no I think the lowest you can get is five so that your second-to-last ball yes is your last ball all right there is a dazzling sazzle so Azal at Ginga yeah good nice level fifty with the ability corrosion held item focus sash moves fake out toxic sludge bomb and flame thrower heat up your battles with Sol Azal in Pokemon Sun or Pokemon moon video game with a code from participating GameStop stores the venomous poison and fire type Pokemon Sol Azal has its signature corrosion ability which enables it to make even usual resistance steel and poison-type pokémon badly poisoned by its potent toxic move stop by your local game shop and pick up a code to receive this Pokemon in your game with just the basic instructions so this is the same thing they did for like in Rock a couple a couple months ago nice and so what corrosion does you kind of said it but just to make it clear typically steel types and poison types can't be poisoned but if you have corrosion you can poison those types speaking of like in Rock a huge discovery of a new like in rock form breaking news well Wow dusk form like in rock will bare fangs in Pokemon ultra Sun and Pokemon ultra moon it has been confirmed that a new form of liken rock will appear in the Pokemon world called dusk form the colors of dusk form like in rock has a slightly different body eyes also differ from midday forum and midnight form you can you can't get desk form like and rock on your team by ordinary methods such as discovering a mysterious Pokemon in the wild so check back soon for news on how to get dusk form like and rock along with more details about Pokemon ultra Sun and Pokemon ultra moon and that was right off Pokemon calm there you go so I believe if some one of our intrepid listeners wants to make the effort one of us did predict that potentially in the ultras that they would be doing new like rocks for like yeah sunrise and dusk spoiler for the anime oh no ash gets a rock rough ah now I'm spoiled Ash's rock rough evolves into this new lichen rock what it was known in the Japanese variety show meet up at Pokemon house that's like a spoiler for a spoiler I know I said spoiler no that's like a triple-decker spoiler cuz it's like the anime is spoiling something in a video game that hasn't come out yet and then you spoiled it I did but uh if you want I don't think the in-game sprite for like and rot it's not a sprites to the reading model of like and rock it's hard to tell like the differences because it kind of does look like midday form a bit but that does the colors but if you look at the anime version of dusk form aka ashes like in rock you can actually like very clearly see the differences because it's an HD drawing yes I would say the biggest difference for dusk form from midday form is dusk form has a larger main so similar to the fact we're midnight forms main kind of comes out and becomes a pompadour so dusk form just the main gets bigger than midday form and it looks like the tail is of like shrinking so it's it really looks like halfway between the two of them form is from what I can see going back to the soul Azal news do you think those are related and what I mean by that is game study this is game stops second Pokemon on a card or Sun and Moon so if they did that for like in rock and now they're doing it for salah soul is salah so going to get a different form are they hinting at we're going to get salah sold gangster form i could see like that leak I could see them doing a male Salah so I feel like that is plausible yeah you know what actually a male's a male Salah soul evolution that is only a distribution so that it doesn't have to be reprogrammed into the game or something like that it also so the the cool thing about Salah soul and like the gimmick there the the quote-unquote gimmick is that only the females can evolve and it's very hard to find a female Sandlot soul and it yeah they're about what is about twelve point five thirteen percent right like that so have you introduced a male version of the Pokemon you're still the female is still just as rare the question is is the female still going to be the better choice in like competitive like does the does the gender and the ability make it better than its male counterpart because if they make a male Salah soul similar with the ability what with at least just the ability then you're you're not giving people an incentive to get the female one if it wasn't different enough in move sets or IVs or they could adjust the stats too right like the female could be faster the male could be more defensive they they they would still have to make them different enough yeah I don't think so la soul's seeing that much a competitive play it's it's got a good good set of weaknesses there and its strongest so yeah its strongest is speed and special attack so possibly they might make it where a male Suazo is speed and physical attack right that potentially something like that final bit of news I have and this is just kind of a shorter episode of so if we miss some news or anything you know let us know but final bit of news here is that if you are participating in the Europe Safari Zone stuff for Pokemon go kangaskhan has migrated over to Europe that Pokemon was previously only Australia bound but it is appearing at locations in Europe so if you're in that region make sure you use that opportunity to get Kangaskhan if you have no plans on going to Australia the other thing is unknowns are appearing more frequently in Europe unknown being the rarest Pokemon in Pokemon go it is available everywhere but it is the rarest Pokemon it is appearing in Europe as well just like it did in Chicago in Chicago the unknowns spelled Chicago in Europe the unknowns are spelling Europe so it is possible to get any e you an are an O and the P unknown in Europe reversal from YouTube as stated that it looks like other letters are also appearing they're rarer but it seems it seems that he at least has found other letters but I'm not hundred percent sure on that part I just know that you can get unknown and it happens to spell Europe so what words can you spell with the combined letters of Chicago and Europe Wow dangerous territory the O is overlapping but otherwise all those other letters are new I know yeah you could spell hope and last bit of news here is for the Yokohama event in Japan which is Pikachu outbreak Phu outbreak it seems that mr. mime will be migrating over there mr. mime is a European only Pokemon in Pokemon go to meet the the Americas exclusive is tauros yes and nobody wanted tauros yeah yes I guess not no one wants Toros yet maybe when Australia has it the Australia will get tauros alright alright and that's that's it for news we're probably missing some stuff but I know I really wanted to make sure I talked about the premiere ball stuff for Pokemon go and I really wanted to talk about that new like and rock that like and rock came out like mid panel last night so I was like I everyone else's tweeted that everyone knows I'll just talk about it at the show yeah may as well I think it was also in korokoro so yes yes yeah we're gonna skip emails this week just because after we're done with Pokemon of the week I'm going to play the back end the back end of this show will just be from the panel which by the way I am gonna cut and edit that I know that some people don't like listening to live shows I did bring I would love to hear your feedback of how this live show sounds because I did bring I did bring my mics that I used daily for those shows and I brought a room mic or the show and so it should actually sound really good compared to the past live shows on top of the fact that I am editing it so it does it does sound more I don't know professional sound more edited it sounds edited well if it's you wanted to not sound edited I'm doing a poor job at selling this you just want nice clean quality audio where the editing is appreciated if not noticeable so we're gonna do our program out of the week which is Mawile which I believe oh I'm sure I'm sure at some point in the history of this program we're good to the point where we're at minimum 25 percent of the way through having potentially hit every Pokemon and we're not doing the Bulbasaur is out there so yeah right that's really limiting us there so shout out to Claire she contacted me on Twitter she really wanted to do mall while for quite a while it is her birthday this week so I was like just remind me and she did so we're gonna do a mall awhile so happy birthday to Claire I know she's been listening to the show for a while we'll take it away here all right Mawile is a short by petal Pokemon with a pale yellow body and black arms and feet its legs have a thick four like covering resembling hakama or a skirt it's most notable feature is a pair of large black jaws emerging from the back of its head these jaws have an oval yellow spot on their top surface and contain ten pointed teeth six on the top row and four on the bottom while the jaws are said to actually be transformed steel horns more while can articulate them at will using them to bite enemies and chew through iron beams it has red eyes and two black ear like extensions on either side of its head mega Mawile has a second set of Jaws protruding from the back of its head and both sets now have a spiky tuft of hair it also seems to be able to control each jaw independently of each other the ear Lake extensions on its head are longer and have tips with two points the fur on its legs is now magenta and it now has longer fur on its arms with magenta markings around its wrists ma while is typically found in caves it uses its non-threatening appearance to make foes underestimate it then attacks with giant jaws when engaged in battle Mawile usually has its back turned on the enemy to better use its jaws no Travis's week to do your move set so I will go ahead and do that and there's no Pokemon go move set from all while unfortunately it doesn't exist in the game this is from slack adamant nature 252 attack 252 speed or an HP life orb with the ability intimidate you're gonna want to use the moves play rough iron head Sucker Punch and Swords Dance not recommended to use this for competitive EDC unless you are throwing a mega stone on that Pokemon but your main strategy is a pretty straightforward one you're going to want to use Swords Dance to get that powered up and then go to town on your opponent after you have a couple sword stances in yeah yeah so the mega Mawile cuz I actually used to use one competitively it gets an ability called huge power which doubles the physical attack so moves like play rough and iron head just because completely abusive so I think that will be a wrap for this episode next week we are doing our live show to celebrate seven years of its perfective I believe it will be noon Central Time on Sunday so watch our Twitter / slack / whatever for more details about that if that changes or adjusts or whatnot I know a lot can happen in a week so if anybody who is listening because we have lots of listeners is going to attack on which is going to be here in Washington DC next weekend I will be there for probably most of the time so just hit me up on Twitter and I'll let you know where to find

emails over to SB j at pkmn cast comm will probably be doing some emails next week as well as all future episodes just not this episode because it was recorded after will and I clearly both have very late nights other than that other than that you can follow will on Twitter at wash in the sink you can follow me on twitter at dragging a lake you want to support us on patreon because you like what we're doing you will get access to our slack community which we seem to mention throughout the episodes that is patreon.com slash it's super effective if not no big deal you know these shows come out every Monday regardless if you do want to you know help it's super effective celebrate seven years of podcasting we would appreciate a review in iTunes I think we're at like 722 reviews this would be really awesome to get to like 750 or even 800 by the end of the year reviews help us out a lot in iTunes it helps the ranking it helps the search engine and helps other people find the show so that's much appreciated if you can just take two seconds to do that if you have Apple device and yeah I think I think that's it I appreciate everyone for listening if you came out and visited us during the Minnesota Polk con thank you so much I can I thank you enough for the the time that you guys took at say hi to us and I totally understand driving several hours to see us and hopefully that was worth it to you just it was just awesome to see everyone there and and very humbling for people to be like hey I listen to your show and I continue to disagree with you every single week and I I nod my head it's very hard to be the point of conflict every single week now you you make it look easy with that being said this has been another episode of the Pokemon podcast and we are super effective [Music] [Music] the vapor man [Music] [Music] the vapor man man hi everyone i s PJ of course my voice in here again podcast recorded here at the Minnesota polka con minor technical issue there was a specific microphone we used to pick up audience noise like audience applause or claps or booze no and booed us unfortunately now and I'm just kidding that mic didn't work and so there's a Q&A segment that we did well it was it was what we've done before like Pokemon questions and answers and we give away prizes and the mic I used at c2e2 wasn't good enough for that so I got a new mic and I set that up but apparently I didn't capture any audio so I don't know if something came unplugged or what actually happened in that case I don't actually know what happened in that case and there was a whole like segment that relied on the mic picking up the audience and it didn't do that so I just ended up cutting all that out so there's like 20 minutes of QA that I cut out that didn't really get that doesn't take away from the the main topic so we do have like 20 minutes of audio of us explaining how to eat Pokemon and whatnot I don't know if that really works without the keynote presentation that we did with it but it should sound decent everyone should sound okay hopefully you guys enjoy that if not you know you got 50 minutes prior to that and before we before I let you listen to that again just letting you know that next week is our seventh anniversary show that is on August 13th at 12 p.m. Central Time that will be live if you cannot make it that is totally ok we will still record it for Monday's episode that will be myself will and Travis and then after we're done with the show at noon I would expect that we have scheduled out an hour to two hours for that show I will take about an hour break and then Myka and I and Irene will be streaming that night Pokemon games and whatnot pretty much all night to celebrate the seventh anniversary so that stuff will be on Twitch I think we're gonna try doing the live show on YouTube of course follow the podcast at Pokemon podcast to stay up to date and/or our Facebook and/or just the website to keep up to date with that and yeah so that's that's that again apologize for the technical issue but we still got twenty minutes of audio and it sounds pretty good I think and enjoy all right hi everyone hello okay so this will be recorded just so you guys know that's why there's mics everywhere and where we start I apologize for the 1982 projector we have displaying what we we Greg Greg warned you Greg got us a projector when we found out last night that these rooms wouldn't be equipped and that's totally cool we improvised you did your best I did my best I adjusted the the following PowerPoint to make it look decent this panel will be probably as long or as short as you guys want if you guys are laughing having a good time will draw it out if no one's saying anything and walking out we'll cut it short so I'm totally up to you know business let's get started my name is SP J I'm the host and creator of the Pokemon podcast called it's super effective and can we get like a cheer or shot pretend that you guys are like a thousand people yeah the people that are at home have no clue what they're missing out so can we get like a cheer like an applause that's real good okay took that the mile yeah Micah can you believe that five thousand people came out to see us I believe I'm so terrified right now so I like I said my name is s BJ next to me is Micah he is on both mythical which is our D&D Pokemon inspired podcast and he's on normal episodes of its super effective correct and down at the end is Greg who is just on mythical but he is the DM and creator of that so he writes all the stories and everything and makes them Pokemon related yep somebody's get back what you get if you don't know what the podcast is we do it every single Monday it is a general Pokemon podcast that's about the card game the video game the anime the mat the Magikarp jump that is Pokemon go and whatnot today we're gonna be talking about watch how it's set up I am for this there we go you the lean every time we wait we're not talking about that yet oh so before we begin on our topic I do have a question so if you answer the question right don't shut it out yet if you answer the question right you'll get a sticker there one question here and then five questions at the end so it kind of forces you to say if hopefully you're having a good time so raise your hand I will usually call what your shirt color is but does anyone know in the Pokemon national dex what the 303rd 300 300 pokémon is oh yeah no no I actually don't know the sealy it's kind of hard I will say it's a cat Pokemon how does that narrow down no yes skitty is it you know skinny so good skitty is great so that's the the Pokemon in the deck so you can come up and get your free sticker so we all five more of those not as hard questions later on the lean okay so now we're here is because we're gonna be talking about how to eat Pokemon or how Pokemon eat each other I guess and we'll go we'll go from there you guys ready oh yeah we're gonna start with desert Pokemon as there are a couple so Oliver I'll read the bullet points we'll discuss and then we'll move on some topics might be a little more in-depth some might not be but we all know vanilluxe vanillish vanillish they are the ice-cream Pokemon and believe it or not they are not eaten in the Pokemon world but they are there are Castelli astone am I saying that right Greg still your combs still eat cones yeah that do mimic and exist and there that's what they're based off of so people those all the time like I guess Lucario loves ice cream now let me ask you is that did the Pokemon like form from seeing a castelia cone or did it did the Casilla get on shaking because of Iowa I would assume that the Pokemon came first I would hope so that was the basis of ice cream sure that was the inspiration was inspiration it was the ice cream swirlix on the other hand also introduced the same generation which is the cotton candy pokemon no one eats that pokemon either surprisingly okay but would you I mean if you saw cotton candy just lying in a field would you think I'm gonna eat that no with a face and a face I see a cow I go oh I'm gonna eat that yeah but swirlix and the and it's evolutionary line they they eat candy they eat candy and sweets and everything so in reality you could baby consume them but no but well the candy that they consume is not living correct they're not eating each other savage over that would be real weird your question oh yeah sorry yeah you're right actually you yes Jen Jen six it is Steve so I just I like to keep all my cotton candy and ice cream pokemon together we have a list of dairy Pokemon here miltank ins could do this could use that grass little goat they both produce milk which is consumed by both humans and pokémon as you can see Professor Oak rather a great time with your eyes this is that another thing the animes gets real wild Chansey and bliss II can lay eggs which again are both consumed by humans and pokémon and Ekans favorite food is the eggs of sparrows and piggies as so confirmed at least via the Pokedex ekans eating some bird eggs here that makes kind of sense I guess based on like real world animals mm-hmm well get to the bug stuff but I'll get to the bug stuff but there are certain bug and plant pokemon that eat insects which then implies that there are animals that are not Pokemon right yeah eat yeah this is all way more believable than a an ice cream cone Pokemon I think so oh yeah well if you look at miltank and its moo moo milk that it produces yeah that is that does restore pokemons HP correct it I think milk and most videogames restores a to be as it should improving those bones that's right get those those yep we have some bird Pokemon here Pidgeotto is known to eat execute Magikarp and Caterpie I think this is made famously in Magikarp jump where Pidgeotto swoops down and the heart break the first time happened to be big it you I was like oh yeah I'll jump jump for the berries right but see you later learn over again I didn't know that could happen tallow is they claim to feed on Wurmple which makes sense because they're in the same generation I think I got that right and [ __ ] what was it cherry be terribly chair be chair B to Ruby Ruby is it is it this a renunciation - Ruby - really it's whatever you want it to be yes I like that but it's like Burger King up here whatever you want yeah Burger King you know have it your way yeah yeah eggs milk crazy Starly likes to eat some chair chair be chair you be chair you be so we have birds eating fruit like and I guess probably seeds another seeds and chair do you think this is it not as it's a cherry sure Gary yeah you think there's like a pit in there Oh like a like a core I think it's yeah I would assume so and we have birds eating bugs which also makes sense mm-hmm I don't know about the execute though what they're eggs I think that's true but like Debray wait actually it doesn't make sense in retrospect no Pidgeotto what is it like no Pokemon look wait a second do birds eat eggs yes do a lot of the predatory birds one okay all right that's fair I didn't research but I bet like Noctowl eats reddit as oh for sure absolutely absolutely in the Sun and Moon anime Rowlett tries to eat the flower thing that evolved on sweet bounce sweet yes burp there was a lot of birdmen history here so birds part to fire fetches hunted for food and it makes a delicious meal this was something that was discussed in the anime and I actually believe here in blue that was referenced by an NPC a novel carry their overhunted I think that was the first instance of like a cooked turkey like a like an image of a cooked fetch is not a turkey yeah yeah duck I mean cooked duck like the image was a cooked bird I see I'm following and I was like oh okay when I was a kid I was like okay farts giving but in retrospect that's horrifying thanks fetch no I like the first one March is much better much better I'm gonna make farts farts making a thing this year Amanda buzz preys on cubone and Meowth can be say is seen chasing piggy at various points on the beach what that means is Pokemon snap where the beach area where Meowth is consistently chasing piggies okay would one would assume to eat maybe or just to be friends with they could be friends maybe they just want to be friends the beach party I don't know if the beach party bug Pokemon may be the best is the best I don't know professors are okay with that miltank that's pretty good - pretty good Combee and vespiqueen gather nectar from flowers to produce honey and various various other things moth um happens to steal that honey which is something I didn't know until I did a little bit of research is that a common moth thing that mom steal I don't know if that's a real-life thing I feel like it has to be right like there's a lot of the stuff is based on real world unless there's like a certain type of moth like a big the honey Steeler moth yeah yeah got it endangered I hear Indian rare the rare giving so I heat more praise upon Durant beyond reasons yeah yeah want to explain why because it's basically an anteater yeah and an ant alright it's a fire ant eater there's also like seviper and zangoose yes yeah they prey on each other another very common is their rivalry is there more rivalries in the Pokemon world I mean young goose was supposed to be much like how it was in Hawaii was supposed to be bred in to take care of the Rattata problem but exactly what's happening in Hawaii now all the impetus that they released in Hawaii said oh the rats are really too hard to hunt so we're just gonna eat all the birds oh-ho there's actually happening in Hawaii that's how that's why that's in Sun and Moon they brought them over to take care of the Rattata who moved to the night cuz uh they don't dwell in all the Mongoose hunt all the birds this is incredible it's the but that's the best this podcast is gonna get this hour is that fact right there go out tell people about the Mongoose problem in Hawaii finally heracross feeds on the sack of Bulbasaur and sucks that sweet sweet nectar out of bubble service both source a cold SAP yeah yes so this is actually from the well like all these gifs they're from the anime and I like that in parentheses you have even in the heat of battle yes now that I put that in parenthesis from RIE myself that Ash's heracross was very didn't care at all about the battle if it was if it was nectar time it was hungry thirsty multiple points in the anime this hair inaudible points docked me to get that sweet sweet nectar juice and that's what's important priorities in life it's it's a glorious image it's an image it's certainly a Vegas it is definitely something because she's just standing by come on I mean we're picking she's not sure which side to join I mean they're all friends Yugi is horrified we've we talked about a couple of the bug Pokemon like warm pool and Caterpie earlier but I would imagine that a lot of the bug Pokemon are not in a good position in the Pokemon world yeah not looking not looking too good for them if they keep making birds yeah whoo they keep making bird keep making birds every generation new birds new Birds what what hunts a bird more bird more birds again other words like braver airy yeah yeah yeah man what was it talonflame yeah talonflame pokemon eating other pokemon this is a pretty good shift I really just want to get entertained just look up Pokemon eating each other and there's a lot of people that don't like for the Pokemon anime but come on after everything I've shown you guys one of the solid source of entertainment I technically don't watch the anime but this is really selling me on it it's both it's actually both sigh answer that question again I didn't know this until I did a little research but when the Grimer became a lowland Grimer they started feeding on trubbish and Garr boater in the a lowland region hmm normal trash was not good enough for them so they literally ate they eat other Pokemon they need that sweet living trash they want the trash that malicious living Trish in the animation relax attempted to eat a gloom let's workout I don't think it was success I don't think that's exactly not and also in the anime and Exploud it tries to eat and acts you which explode and strikes me as a non carnivore Pokemon you think so it's got a huge mouth it's a real real big mouth yeah but it has like a big stereo and it said and it doesn't need to eat yeah that screams to me like vegetarian one of the only a little bit only ate electric pokemon that would make a lot of sense unfortunately it's already eating axe you know that cetera and both kingler and omastar they prey on shelter crack open that shellfish okay that makes a lot of sense that makes it yeah uh you skip the sorry go ahead no you're good Morini they uh like zangoose and seviper they are rivals with corsola the only differences corsola doesn't fight back and just gets eaten and the dex entry is that's pretty terrifying really trigger buying it's also something about leaving remains of course lacrosse the beach it's very dark it's a little dark candy and maybe I'm mistaken and I haven't played Sunday moon in a couple months and I haven't completed my decks I apologize but can't the only isn't the only way to get Marini is SOS battle with reversal oh yeah man that's so cool and it's real hard I spent a lot of time yeah and if you no no no man I don't have the patience for that let's get to the good stuff humans eating Pokemon fYI I'm pretty sure Ash's mom and mr. mime are a couple would you stop you have been trying to sell this all day we have the official word out on sun and moon they get pretty close weird beach scenes with those two yeah they're enjoying their vacation slowpoke tails let's talk about those alright yeah they actually had an epiphany about this when we were away so there we were talking about the how we read that how you're supposed to eat slowpoke tails is there supposed to be lightly sucked on which we were like what what does that mean I don't think what now I think that it's supposed to mimic like bone marrow and how you eat bone marrow mmm which is you suck on it lately or you use a very tiny fork a very tiny spoon and you or a spoon you dig it out of there yeah and it's really delicious we research man but deep in the slowpoke well let me tell you it's like a 12 year old place gold and silver that's kind of a horrifying yeah of like all these slowpokes with no tails Team Rocket and that's hustling you know well some we're just hacking them up but I mean do you think like goldenrod festivals they have carts full slowpoke tails for the children like is there a slowpoke vendor yeah and then it comes from everybody's asking where they're coming right it's like is that sounds like the cigarettes of the pokemon world like yeah everyone kind of enjoys it like they all know it's it's bad for me like you know I would guess it's probably similar to like what's that like like pate like duck liver what like duck liver it like pate is very not let me tell you on fetch fetch giving we're not having any it's it's a delicacy it is or goose liver sorry and it the way that they they make it is very inhumane so I would assume it's similar to that like but don't seem that bothered by the fact that they don't have tails in the game its slowpoke they don't seem bothered by anything okay that is accurate far-fetched which we talked about earlier it is cooked with its own leek which i think is important really yeah it's so sad well that's the tale that it comes from that if you're super hungry lost in the woods the woods will provide by providing you not only a bird to eat but with its own seasoning cuz so sick that's why the tale is far-fetched what if what if you know you find the far fetch Li CLIs is it just not know then you're done yes now we're destined to not eat it it's just a duck at that point it's just a duck cedrus fins and bones are used in herbal medicine not really food related but I just thought it was interesting that they did talk about mmm cedras bones yeah is that like shark fin soup I yeah like maybe how they use sea creatures yeah you know like perfume and stuff like that not not included in the suggesting on this slide on the podcast there was debate about it Pokemon bleed or not or Pokemon that blood and the only reference in all of the 700 million Pokemon that exists is that gold gold bats pokedex says that it does feast on blood of humans and pokémon yeah that does confirm that Pokemon do have lost samples not have blood I'm assuming ditto does not mean you don't know that maybe what if I transformed into blood then what transform into buildings octillery Magikarp chair ruby terribie they have all they're all referenced as being possibly eated but never confirmed throughout all the research I found in India you could point to Magikarp in look at the anime and go that ash and Brock fantasized about eating a Magikarp when they were stranded off the SS an but they don't actually eat the Magikarp and I believe it was misty that told them that they couldn't eat a Magikarp if they wanted to because it's it's nothing but scale is incorrect but your favorite fish bascule n' masculine delicious at least has the most delicious oh really yes it is listed as the most delicious d and you hated it what is the most delicious human fish would like I've been another is a video game about human fish but give me a give me the human fish I don't know it's like go to your real words like what yeah like what's a good real world like the best we're in Minnesota so I think we're legally mandated to say walleye walleye I don't know walleye okay I mean what is it in Wisconsin cod chase maybe yeah the old cheese fish giant cues the cheese surprisingly I don't think anybody in Wisconsin eats their fish with cheese now you don't know that you're right I don't know that uh this is pretty much it though we're ending on a human eating Pokemon was there anything else that stood out I mean I probably does a lot of this stuff was cut just due to the the projector here but the good ol projector situation but I don't think so I feel like they're more like fruit was it we're talking about before has fruit yeah banana bananas didn't somebody say earlier today that Chikorita is like supposed to be a pear it's a pair of dinosaur pear dinosaur it is it looks like a pear it's paradise or what would you think if is the seasoning what do you think would eat well actually true here's my question I add there there you know seven hundred some Pokemon I'm assuming people are eating tauros and and miltank as they would eat like cows yeah yeah beef right mainly so that if you look at like the Ducks as like far fetch sour people eat inside ducks maybe no okay so it is not like the duck that you would see in like apart the the pond in a Milwaukee Park I suppose that makes sense it's like the the best Psyduck I'm assuming is like the the duck that you see in the pond at the park that right probably so you're thinking that's giving you a headache is too gross for anybody yeah no one want to see that so then you turn around go in the forest and find yourself our fish you know you have to get lost first what is okay I'm going in the forest there's like a 98% chance yeah absolutely accurate I was gonna say back to mr. mom what was mr. mom eaten human food nothing but human food he's making something probably cooking a far fetch yeah maybe he's got a face like you've eaten a far fish face of satisfaction right there let's do some more trivia so again don't shout it out if you know just raise your hand I'll call on you but in the Pokedex pokemon are classified as certain things so like swirlix is classified as the cotton candy pokemon if I'm not mistaken butter Frese classified as the but the butterfly pokémon only one pokemon in the Pokedex is considered the atrocious pokemon if I'm saying that correctly does anyone know who that is ooh russer oak yes Plus no one R I'll narrow down Jen one we're still on mister my please still way in the back Team Rocket no no that's a good answer Trey all the way in the back in I'm on the edge of my seat no it's almost definitely not bubble sir uh blue blue hair maybe blue make purple no no kind of getting closer from aura no t-shirt yes oh come up and get sticking up and that is our questions thank you everyone for playing sorry they were kind of hard [Laughter] awesome well that is pretty much as pretty much our show sorry it was short but we do what we could we did what we could we did the best of
