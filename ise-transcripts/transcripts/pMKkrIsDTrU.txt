what's up everyone welcome to the 218 episode of the Pokemon podcast i'm your host SBJ and to my left is Travis I'm cheer left I didn't know there were doing are we doing video I remember to turn on my mother's the video you're getting me off the rails and were like hardly even like two seconds into this we haven't even gotten on the rails no to my right is will well since we're sitting in the dark i'm actually on your left Travis and I switch places without you telling you ah ok so are the rails that's why I was all confused because it's which happened so quick oh you want to talk about confusing talk about well I'm not even to talk about it yet but when Steve talks about it I'm gonna talk about it and we'll talk about confusing and annoying at the same time I don't know what that means or what I'm supposed to be that'll be the mystery of the episode and when people realize what it is I think they're gonna have a light bulb go off and there there my time giving them a story moment I see as a gift this episode feels already really foreign to me because for the last like three weeks we have either recorded on a thursday or we have recorded some version of that live and now we're like back to our sunday schedule at noon central time is that what time it is because i just woke up your nap a hundred my nap yeah that's where it is the tour it is we get some oh we got some Pokemon needs to go through and some other stuff to talk about but before we get to that how was your guys's week well what's what's new in the life of DC it's really really hot um which is probably the same for a lot of places but see him given that like a week ago it was really cold I'm not dealing with this particularly well and I as I was supposed to run seven miles this morning but it was so hot that I only ran six miles and I hate myself now and I'll never forgive myself for missing that one last mile and I tried to build a different vanguard deck from the one I've been using a lot lately and I'm haven't been able to so its failures all around speaking speaking of anger and how's how's your are you say speaking of failures all around Travis haha I don't have that good transitions Travis you giving me too much credit i giveth I was gonna ask well how his other podcast is doing your Vanguard podcast it seems to be doing good we hit episode 10 we had we interviewed a writer for alter reality games on episode 10 which I'm trying to do like some format stuff where every 5 episode is about what does that call what it's like the stories in the background of the cards and things like that not necessarily the case like American water the lower lower larocca so every five episodes of the lore episode every 10 episode is an interview episode so we just did an interview episode so for the first ten episodes I've held to that grand plan and and we do have listeners and we do get the occasional feedback so I'm even listeners who don't play Vanguard which um yeah what thumbs up I appreciate it even though we really only talk about Vanguard so the number number 1 vanguard podcast in iTunes it's also the only Vanguard podcast tonight well no that's not true there are other ones in itunes it's just we're the only one that has put out an episode since december of 2015 so there you go what did I was in a hole in the market be alive we're doing noteworthy in the games section oh yeah such that's your time to advertise we're not advertise but make sure like you're putting your strongest content forward the strongest content debatable the best content we can manage to offer truth okay all right Travis what's new well I'm glad to hear from will but one week I was actually in Washington DC was the week that it was cold and immediately after I left is trying to get warm again that is cold and rainy ha I'm starting to think that I'm not always cold just because I live in Michigan but be cuz my negative attitude about the world around me changes it in a sort of storm like way like that the hip x-man that that's it that's that's hitting theaters she changes and water I just make it gloomy and terrible I was in like last weekend I was in Columbus Ohio for rock on the range was a music festival and between the buried and me and at the drive-in and the sword were all unbelievable and part of me but it's 2016 I believe we can use the term X person the movie that is excellent it's against as much as much as I would prefer that the movie were called uh X folks which is like way about her that agree a dogs out of all the word that's the one you're gonna go with folks so hey folks all the time okay all right I am part of a dbag unity called the inclusion society and we have managed to hack a number of AMC and other brand movie theaters so that all their digital displays say X people and if we find a physical display it says x-men we go in the middle of the night and we replace the letters to say X people d is that a is that like a rock do you remember i think it was in like the mid-90s when or maybe it was even before my time it was in the 80s but the what was it called it was like the Barbie liberation squadron or something will you remember this right no oh shoot well I I'm not gonna be able to get you the episode where Lisa Simpson try to design a new version of the doll I'll just assume yeah it's a modern business lady and it didn't work oh but I am a member i am a member of the actual group the crochet Liberation Front so there's there's that as opposed to the inclusion society which doesn't exist and I don't know how to hack anything except like a slice of ham why I tell the Barbie liberation squadron or front or whatever it's called story yes they do did they do let's hear a was some some particular Barbie like many of them where it was very specific like it was it was a talking barbie and it was all like I love to go shopping and cook because those are the only things that women are allowed to do right like he was saying very the gender roles were being reinforced in this Barbie so what this this group did is they went and they would open up the back of the toys there take out the voice box and swap it with the voice voice box of the GI Joe toy that was out at the same time so you would buy the Barbie and it would be like good to the frontline the enemy's a year now and then you would buy the GI Joe it would be like I love shopping and uh moms across all of the Midwest i assume is where it happened because that's where moms get angry moms across all of them it was for furious that their their poor children were being subjected to women who don't like shopping I guess hmm but if it reminds me a lot of that lisa simpson episode that will road up yeah I do remember the Cabbage Patch Kid riots of the 80s but barberia liberation I do not speaking of Barbie liberation i liberated some aliens in a game called stellaris which is not a movie well I'm sure it is a movie the movie a classic Russian sci-fi movie but Irene and I played some stellaris last night which is a 4x game and I don't know whether all the X's stand for explorer it's like expand Germany expand we're missing one sermon aight i think was late for x like you mean foreign exchange right no forex forex is like the genre that civilization is yeah yeah it's a sieve it's like civilization what's the newest 15 are they m5 or then for still like civilization 5 is out civilization sex was just announced okay here to now go yeah so still ours the Forex game I can't remember last one explore expand exterminate and looking at up explore expand exploit and exterminate okay I was going to say celiac why not call it 3x if you can't think of a fourth one exploit I I guess that's the pole that's the political stuff right like exploit I guess no no no exploit your resources oh okay yeah you expand into your territory you exploit the resources of that territory so you bought a fuel further expansion that's that's fair yeah so we've so cuz Irene was like let's do something together let's do something together and so I was like hey let's this game is political you like politics let's play it and so she went in not knowing anything about it and I was like well you know let's go through like creating because you can create your whole like race and what kind of creatures you look like and like what kind of political stance your country wants to take and you know standard I'm sure that's in civilization to I haven't played civilization since civ3 but like right away like she got sucked in of like I want to be the bird people known to be the Fox people know I wanna be this knot and then like it only got deeper as we got into like what kind of characteristics do you want do you want to be like friendly you're like intelligent or whatever elephants do remembering stuff and then cuz that's an elephant's do ya remember and then they go to the same place to die those are the two sales in fact about elephant remember the trait but in a little picture for healthy anyways we went through all that and yeah we started that we played that for about two hours but it is definitely a 4x game it is very you know wait wait for timers take over land get screwed over by the CPU yep very for hex but yeah that's that was those my weekend is that a free playstation 4 download it is a I got it on steam and I don't I don't really buy any games on Steam but it is a computer only game i can pc and I think linux too but it's made by paradox I think they make other popular for x games and it was forty dollars though not gonna happen number one I want to get steam off my computer number two forty dollars yeah yeah well the good thing about like paradoxes they support their games for super long time so they've already rolled out a couple major update you don't even know what other games they've made and yet you know that they support their games for a long time I could look it up I've played some of their other games and when you read a bunch of stellaris news Travis people always go they support their games for a long time so I just took that and rehashed it here and what podcast but I think that's a classic theme of it's super effective rehashing clip your peoples new yes meaning of rehashing other people's news welcome to trainers digest really what we should be babies episode a let's talk about inspiration organization was in 1993 um and they replaced 300 to 500 dolls with the voice box of GI Joes we get it all we all facts right in about 10 minutes Travis will bring up what games paradox is made and then we'll make another reference also bring up what elephants do all right good i like i like this format of us mentioning stuff we're not knowledgeable about and then you correcting us several minutes later i'll warn everybody my two pokemon are about to get into a battle and and it's gonna be an auditory nightmare for everyone when it happens I don't know what that means but my cat is on the floor my dog is up on the bed the cat's about to jump up and scratch the dog in some way alright likes to do it's like you have pokemon go in your house right now and us field testing for Pokemon go is now alive you are like the five people they chose in the u.s. to pick all of them Greg's right like a judge or anything poke mango features more than a hundred catchable Pokemon I don't know if you guys knew that but that is a that was recently stated in their last press release number like that's not generally like it's just generation one right from everything I've seen I've only seen Pokemon from generation one that's a grand even the roster I mean like unless by more than 100 they mean 151 probably what they do do we should actually look at early marketing materials for original pokemon and it probably says over 100 catchable Pokemon well I mattress to see well my guess would be it's all 150 minus legendaries and mythical so then it would be weird to say like there's a hundred and thirty catchable Pokemon are you supposed to get the I refuse to make the distinction from legendary mythical are you supposed to find legendaries then I would they would probably roll those out from like a get your get your zapdos at target how would i would assume those were open on the Rock of Gibraltar if you want yourself or regigigas soap oh c'mon Go field testing now live I don't know anyone personally that got access to it will did you say you knew some people no I said that Greg's friends all got access to it gamemaster Greg game dungeon master dungeon master gray well depends technicalities that's true you're not wrong I have feet i I just I just the hashtag searched Pokemon go on on Twitter and found a mostly people mostly people complaining that they didn't have access to Pokemon go but a couple people dating they did I don't I don't know like the the announced the I I can say on one end I'm like slightly disappointed that I didn't get access to the beta and i'm not sure if codes are still going out or not probably not on the other end i burned through mobile games pretty quickly so i don't know if it would be so in depth or so engaging that like i would burn through it and then when it actually comes out i would i would be disappointed and then I'm really doesn't help that you were calling ingress a terrible game on Twitter yeah are you still playing clash Royale uh yeah I am still playing clash Royale but not not as much as when I was on The Clash hi so you are a game cobbler yeah yeah up the element in the game game gobbler the I the other thing that kind of bothers me is I'm not a big fan of betas we're like hey put eight hours into this and now you just lost it all because it's not the official game I mean I get it that's what a beta is but some people like that some people don't I'm I I can usually hold up and wait it's it's hilarious cuz how long ago did Pokemon shuffle come out probably over Pokemon shuffle has been the only pokemon game we've talked about in this pokemon podcast for like missed three years well it hasn't been three years so much shuffle is just over a year old now is it not so yeah so see that's the difference between you and me is I guess it's a little over a year old I only stopped playing shuffle every single day on Monday of last week so I don't burn out on mobile games or any kind of game unless life presents a change that forces me to stop playing it you know I almost turned on Pokemon shuffle the other day and the reason I didn't was because I was a Nintendo badger kid Oh which that's another part of news and I didn't want to close Nintendo badge arcade wait for shuffle to open and then know that later that night i would go back into the Nintendo badger kid so flow shuffle wait for badger kid to open at wow no seriously like that that was my take that long they want to play a game called the Badger they're what's that about there it there's something satisfying about opening your 3ds and the game already being right there with no load like that is what I strive for instance we go c'mon podcast to not play pokemon I mean I I played all kinds of games and I just switch between them like a regular patient person but I'm not a game gobbler as I just proved but you have to wait for the game to close and open and it's like 30 seconds no one is with you alright that's that's very intense Nintendo badger cave there are Pokemon badges in it if any of you have either of you played Nintendo Patrick you don't really play Nintendo fat jerk it let's get out that of the way yeah that's just from what I understand that's just a huge money sock yep we up right there's no point way to play about spending money on it no there's totally a way to play with without spending money i mean they give you one free play every day well sometimes you can get two or three plays but like by default you're always gonna get one free play every day well I can't fuel any more addictions to daily play games so now so far far listeners that might not be familiar Nintendo badger kid came out oh man when did that come out like right before Christmas of last year i think and i think in november and badges it's like our news is going into news well have some news about like badges / pins later on but these are digital badges that all they do is they either sit in your collection in Nintendo badger arcade or what you can do is you can put these badges on your home screen on your 3ds and like arrange them in different ways you can also like if you have a folder you could put the badge on top of the folder so instead of just having a blue folder you can have like an image of like a tran older what's that a megaman folder yeah you could have a megaman folder you can put Isabelle on a folder or something the last thing you can do is some of the icons like look like what was what was that girl that got banned Swapnote girl Nikki what remember Swapnote I'm 3d us that it got like I do you remember Swapnote you got is so salty that it's gone they got banned but like there were Nikki badges and like there was like a wrench in the form of like the nikki art style and so you could make that wrench be your Settings button so those are like your three extents you do nothing with the badges you put them on your home screen or you turn them into like utility things like like a settings folder so when you first get into bed your kid you I think you get like five free plays and it is it is the claw game that's all it is you you the only button you press is a you hold down a to move the claw and then you let go of a and the claw does it's grabbing claw thing picks up a badge sometimes pulls it up most of the time does not pull it up and then if it drops it into the the whole you get the badge and it's your badge forever where the the free-to-play thing comes in is there's a practice catcher where you get you get like seven or eight claw things and you're driving practice badges and and when when the badges like flip over at the end if there's like a free play on the back of the badge that's that's how you get free plays for the real catcher and most of the time you collect like seven badges and it goes oh there's no free plays in the back of these oh well but since you played here's your free play so like always by default you get free play um but the trick is there's a couple tricks so if you just go through all the levels of badges sometimes like by i don't know like going through the machine like it kind of shakes the stage and sometimes a badge will like roll off the edge and you get a free badge just by like seeing what badges are there I think it's just their way of like here's a two percent chance of if you looked at all our play boards you get it but then so the actual price is you get five plays if i'm not mistaken for a dollar and then ten plays for two dollars three plays for fifteen they don't give you like an it like I feel like if you're paying more money you should get more plays but it's it's one play / it's five plays / a dollar and the reason I'm talking about nitendo badger kate is because there's been a bunch of Pokemon badges the last week or two well I was just gonna say you're saying that but aren't there like 300 Pokemon badges oh yeah yeah at least I put I put money in cuz I was like I'll just you know what what is what is ten dollars to get a bunch of Pokemon badges no they keep coming I'm I can't do it anymore there's just too many badges there's way too many badges like if you go to bulbapedia right now and you look at the the badge list there has to be over 200 different pokemon badges already so if out of 5 plays you get one badge that know you'd probably you could you could easily get i would say four badges purva five plays like it so it doesn't sixty dollars yeah it doesn't screw you over that badly and fifty dollars for decorations on my digital screen yep yep it's terrible i think at this point i put eight dollars in the nintendo badger kid but I have many badges how many pokemon badges you have out of those eight dollars out of eight dollars i probably have about forty badges all right 40 or 50 but a better video game player than i am so like it it is it because he has badges though that's right so whatever yes employee I have all the best Stevie down the street has a power glove he's so good at games badger Kade the I have no words for how we broke my friend brandon has an atari lynx it's so cool what what happens when we don't no longer have a 3 this is this is my big question what happens when the 3ds goes away because I am sure there are whales people who spend hundreds of dollars and badger kid to make sure they have every single badge hmm what where did they go after the 3ds like they could be like any other 3ds game where it's like this game is tied to this council like animal crossing wild world you know that's your DS game it's not coming forward your progress is staying on the original DS but like Nintendo badger cade seems like something where it's like you're collecting these because it's a game based on collecting and we're letting them we're letting you put them on our home screen so in the other thing is it's so late in the 3ds like lineup like it's not like the 3ds launched with Nintendo badger cave like they released it less than six months ago so what happens when the 3d s is gone do you just lose all like the battle mean they're gonna introduce badge arcade bank obvious okay I don't know it's but it's just a weird thing what about all the custom backgrounds that I paid a dollar each for dollar fifty four I mean yeah you're right cuz like I'm playstation 3 you could have custom backgrounds too and those were just tied to your ps3 you can have custom backgrounds on the ps4 to it's just everybody's learned their lesson and nobody buys them yeah yes that is accurate um yeah so uh there are still as of this recording there should still be some pokemon left and put one badger kid so if you're into that thing go go nuts if you're into badgers go right ahead during the badges that jerk aid did you guys get your xerneas Eva tall and zygarde I got three of each yes yes sir Oh No perfect pokémon podcast 101 I there's an article just saying battling can be easy as X Y Z and pokemon calm and it just talks about the what the best use for these three pokémon are if you're interested in that turns out if you have czerny is a vocal and Zygons i guard on your team you'll do pretty well know if you have xerneas eval towns i guard on your team and you go to a lola there's a special cave that you can go to that will only open if you have all three of them on there and you'll get a manaphy you have a push the truck first though I said cave not well xerneas can gio man see the truck out of the way there you go how did you have to thank you at first you have to evolve your Spiro into a peak of blue it was that it's really pretty reckless or a prerequisite yeah I'll TL DR that article for you xerneas is competitive zygarde is a joke yveltal hmm not so much journey is it ok i love xerneas as a pokemon as a pokemon design but geomancy is such a garbage trash cuz i like that move is so good with whatever urban is that you need to do the thing i think mental herb or a white herb yeah exactly i can't remember which one it is but God mental herb is the one that keeps you from getting true into a truant it Oh wanted good white or gone us journey is so unfair poken tournament is a thing do people still play that game you know that that's my question to thee there's a championship series going on and it will be at other events like the Seattle regionals which I don't believe has come up yet the Wisconsin regionals was just last weekend poking tournament will be at nationals it'll be out world's people play it I guess not me anymore I thought you had again no i did i did i did i play with your son played anymore yeah i played it for brow about six or seven weeks oh yeah a little over a month yeah yeah played it every every thursday night and played a couple other nights just practicing but yeah I doesn't didn't have legs for me yeah it is a good game and it's a fun game and I mean like i'm not a huge gamer and i will say it is it is good and fun but it's not one that when you have other games to play you're gonna choose poke and tournament look I set it right over those other games the thing about I mean that's sort of the thing about fighting games right is more so than almost any other genre except maybe like MOBAs if you count that as honor of its own if you don't plan on plant like if your casual trash like we are not with that attitude you play it and it's fun but it gets to a point where to fully enjoy the depth of the game you have to dedicate a lot of time to it that's just how fighting games work and sometimes it's more of an investment but you're going to give it a particular date or time yeah I think where I fell off was I hit my my skill I hit feel like the glass ceiling of my skill where I was like I I am this good and if I wanted to get better like I need to invest this much time and that time is too important to me yeah like I but like if if if will or if you Travis or any other you know I know they like Pokemon person came over to my house and we were just like hanging out for the weekend Poquelin tournament would be one of the things that I would be like let's play this on the couch together and have a great time and it will be it would be a great time but you like continue to play it online and and don't get me wrong like playing with with the Pokemon podcast listener base like playing with them was fantastic was super fun but again like it was just your missing so much of the fighting game experience when it when when they're not sitting next to you yea though I poking tournament still very seems to be doing popular in the fighting game scene but I haven't heard much outside of that which I make is it is it popular in the scene if I to do people like competitive fighting game people because I'm just used to things that are made by a Nintendo that try to do that as being and I realized that the crossover a second but I'm just used to people saying what like well smash brothers isn't a real fighting Gator you know I mean I'm used to that sorry I should do people in who are super into fighting games do a lot of them play it competitively even if they're not huge Pokemon fans I well none of us are those people so right sure just I mean I I when I was playing pokin weekly i was i was on the subreddit just like reading strategies or you know zoning zoning is a big thing in in poking tournament which is real real simply put it's just like knowing what moves you can or cannot do in a certain area mmm ben and i would say the that is one of the biggest things in polk and tournament i'm sure it's very important in other fighting games again i'm not an expert but it seemed like the people who are good at pokin and got behind pokin they're also like the same audience that got behind smash brothers and I don't think those two audiences have gone outside of that wheelhouse and that's not to say like like street fighter people are probably only in super industry fighter and yeah killer instinct again super into that but I don't think pokin attract anyone I don't think pokin stole the the Dead or Alive community yeah so what's really disappointing to me was I kind of I guess subconsciously had thought that Nintendo would have learned from their success with splatoon where when that first came out everybody played it for a little while and they're like jeez it's just like five levels what's what's up with this game and so you know limited and then like every two months they came out with new levels every week hitting it would yeah there were in one stage a week and then they had the splat fests for drawing people in to remind them to play and you know like you know even the stupid ones which was like what like hot dogs vs. they end with hamburgers or something like that yeah yeah no you're right and people will get excited they talk about on social media it's like I'm gonna be team hot dog and um and like there's none of that for pokin and there could be yeah I remember they could do like online tournaments and they could do like even if it was like not new Pokemon if it was just new background stages to play and you can because like that's part of the fun it's like seeing what's going on in the background when you're playing in a different arena and all the clothes and stuff I mean I know you have every color of Santa hat but maybe they could have come out to do clothes I do or things for your trainer and just do done that monthly and everything that would have gone some level kept people interested but it's just like it launched it was what it was and it became stale rather rap I remember being at Midwest gaming classic and the amount we could we had to poke ins and shout out to K listener of the show who brought his his wii u his copy of pokin and and his controller very nice of them but we had to to poke and set up the first day they were just you know face computer the second day we linked him and I couldn't believe how many people came in and was like I can't wait till we get more Pokemon more DLC blah blah blah like they were going on and on about it and another thing you do myself like I'm pretty sure they say that they had zero plans for DLC and updates to this game and it is now four months later yeah probably probably what's hindering it is that it originally came out as an arcade cabinet and from what I understand those arcade cabinets are disappearing like even in the arcades in Japan they're they're not there people aren't using them so they're taking them out I mean that doesn't surprise me but hey think you hit the nail on that a bit ago we're like pokin would have been a game where you say like here's a new stage or here is a ash hat for your Pikachu that you could put on during battle over here is like a sash you could wrap around like something just cosmetic because if you look at games like overwatch like the only the only thing that game has going for it after you drop your forty to sixty dollars is is you can spend more money right like it all it is the skins nothing else skins sprays voice like everything after your initial purchase an overwatch is purely cosmetic what's it say well it's okay so first a spray is the thing where you can have your character spray paint a little oh go onto the wall or whatever but also just in overwatch this case I think I mean they are planning on more game modes I think or does not even like competitive there's not even like a rank q yet so so I think I realize you're just giving that as an example but I think they're planning on doing more with that right you're right well but if you were if you were to go out today and by overwatch for forty dollars or sixty dollars depending on where you get it yeah the everything out of the gate in that game is unlocked all the levels the the I think there's two different game modes and then 20 of 24 characters I think everything is unlocked right away the only thing you're unlocking after that is is skins and sprays and there's like a hundred different layers skins for every character and people are dropping money for that like that is what gets people going like that for me adding I didn't care that much I mean I have a different like loot driven mindset and destiny but like in overwatch that clearly works and it works very well and poking like pokin could have done something as simple as like here is a rainbow Santa hat this week but I think but I think will is right that like you know they weren't even really sold on selling it to the Western market until there was a pretty large call for at least they were and it was unclear whether it was going to come here right and I think will is right that's mainly because it to then its first and foremost an arcade an arcade cabinet and if if you went to them and were like why isn't there there dlc for bokken tournament they're like you mean that our cade cabinet we made right like like the grand strategy for that my thing is that they see it differently than we do because we don't have that aspect of the game you know so when you edit that um Steve can you just have it repeatedly having Travis AI think will is right cuz that's just enough right there if i remember i'll repeat it a couple times will make its unreal good maybe put a little like nice like bump and beat behind it don't ever say bump and beat well you sound like a 60 year old Midwestern I'm getting there I'm getting there guys uh yeah poking tournament still a game that exists paradox development studio is a Swedish video game developer fouler than 1995 and is best known for its grand strategy game series europa universalis hearts of iron a crusader kings and victoria there we go Travis bringing the hard facts to Pokemon inspire podcast look not give it up okay i guess a member just come on spires podcast haha Pokemon fans will have another chance to download mew mew will come in june spoke my newsletter as a downloadable code that thuds I mean that's pretty much the news well hidden ability mew is it did uh it is the same exact one that gave a giveaway in February mm-hmm did

pokemon emails like I just got the Pokemon Center one a couple days ago don't ever remember getting the bird one now you better look for it before it expires no way no no that's okay all right I guess everybody shits are awaiting the next sir III know I'm not wanted yuh last less article here um a put her follower chronic sleeper on Twitter messaged me this morning and said old news what I want to hear your take on this but we'll hear your take on two guys uh this is off a NeoGAF thread now let me preface I don't read me a pic yeah you said old news but you didn't prep me for all this was gonna I was I was surfing the Geo cities and for some reason neogaf is so popular this is actually from exactly about nine days ago here so not that old I'm not gonna read the whole post because most of its somebody's opinion but I'll just get right to the the gist here nugget bridge tweeted 15 of the top 50 players were disqualified for cheating in the Japan Cup and the final standings are now being updated on Pokemon global link yeah that heard about that all right if for those unfamiliar the top 50 get a day one invites the Pokemon world championship top 30 to get an invitation at the Japanese national championship to do this they had one weekend to play a maximum of 40 maybe 30 battles on a special in-game ladder and hope they're yellow would be the top 32 of 50 the rest the world plays in an offline circuit like Capcom / oh that's just Japan stuff but there's your there we do this in the United States there's a weekend where tournaments open you play it ranks you elo Pokemon publishes what what pokemon are popular like a month later this is nothing new but in Japan there there's really only this way to get into the national championships the Japanese national championships FYI so there was a rust you have to go to a regionals and you have to be there in person and in Japan you can do it through an online competition that's that's the main difference and the last thing I want to stay here is an FYI there was a follow-up from a Japanese player that was qualified from the 15 that was disqualified using hacks were detected the those that were we're using a save file manipulation to repeatedly lose to other game carts while queuing up in the same time as multiple 3d asses and to try to push themselves into the ranking Japan's qualification system is fully under Georgia turds jurisdiction of the pokemon company so it differs from region to region which are under jurisdiction of the pokemon company international unfortunately japan has used this awful this is where an opinion comes an awful online ladder battle qualification method since 2012 and this is what it leads to but obviously so that that's not what I had heard about this situation I had heard that they were using bots and by using the bots they were recording what teams other people were using so that when they actually in there a competitive game came across them they already knew like what teams and moves the other people were using my that I mean you could be right i was confused by what you were saying because it sounded like what you're saying is they were skirt they're using some sort of they rang so devil they lose a bunch of games in a row it should make a lot of sense to me what alternate competitors and the alternate competitors would automatically lose to them which window ringing right yeah yeah that's the that that situation I explained where like you you you purposely get like a cart that you're going to lose against that's like super popular in clash royale not to bring about much shriya but you you just make an account that account keeps losing until it's useless and then you just delete it and make a new account and then keep meeting that new account until it's useless and just win trading right there um so it's it's similar to what people do in the states where they go to a regional with a bunch of their friends and just agree like if you're competing against me then you're gonna lose yep right so I can win yep there there is you mean that there's there's people in the world that just like lie oh it wasn't that your lesson that you learned with me po and don't cross the streams we can't reference other podcasts on this podcast that there's a lot to unwrap and talk about here and I don't know how deep you guys want to go in but let me start off saying like I know a lot of competitive Pokemon players in the community and they're all great people though the ones i know at least everyone you heard it here first folks everyone anything anyone has done in the pokemon competitive community is officially a okay in the eyes of Steve jr. but welcome on VG sees or egcg or pokin or whatever whatever Avenue you want to go down for your competitive Pokemon battling wants to be taken seriously like this stuff has to stop and the easy argument would be like Oh ray Rizzo two years ago had a dream hacked pokemon which he didn't use but it had an egg move that it could not never learn and he said he got it from a friend and he was your world championship champion three times and he didn't get disqualified he didn't get banned they just acknowledged that he had a Pokemon that was clearly hacked and they moved on if this was league legends and they were this was dota or this was counter-strike not that I'm very familiar with those but i'm pretty sure that stuff wouldn't really pass people you play like competitive league players get like suspended for weeks because they said a naughty word at the lake like they flipped someone off at a tournament or something so they're a little more tricks yeah and I think I think it should be especially like if you want yeah competitive video games to be taken seriously like that stuff just doesn't fly like if if a football player who gave somebody the finger he'd probably be suspended too yeah yeah yeah or find I think that so right there's a very clear problem that exists in competitive Pokemon that exists everywhere and so this is hard for me to say it the right way but like in other sports let's say e sports and sports all together there is an organizational body that takes actions to reprimand people who cheat or play incorrectly and that in some ways is in line to counteract something where they can't regulate which is fanboying right there are a lot of people who are in the competitive pokemon community who are super fans of particular competitive Pokemon players whether it's because they also have YouTube channels or they're just very public or just because they win a lot where it's like I will be happy if i can just contribute to this famous person's success rather than you know i'm here to compete for myself as well alright that exists in all sports like you you even if you're a competitor in basketball baseball or something else and you're a huge fan of another player you might alter your own performance just because you're a fan of that other player I think basketball and baseball are probably bad examples maybe car racing I don't know anything about that but the organizational bodies like try to take regulatory action so that when something is just a very crass display of the poor play sportsmanship let's put that way right poor sportsmanship that they will take action regulatory action against that and that doesn't exist right it's very clear it doesn't exist in competitive Pokemon at all yeah yeah I think you could you could look at you could look at competitive games like poking tournament everyone is going to be at this the same playing field no matter if they put one hour in or they put two thousand hours and not regarding the weird 127 hours in starring whatever James Franco it's embarrassing that I could that I was about to call him Danny Boyle was the director of that maybe say the same could be said for overwatch again everything you you pay for that purchase is is unlocked and ready to go and I'm sure eventually overwatch will get into the competitiveness or the official ranking and stuff then you look at you look at a game like just your standard pokemon x and y you don't start at the same playing field and if you want v's if you want Ivy's if you want specific pokemon that all takes time and so a lot of competitive players they go well like look at a fighting game that you don't have to EV train Ryu or or blanca or chun-li like they're they're just there then the best they can be and now it comes down to the skill of a player so it's not even I'll go beyond that it's about integrity right because because it's clearly known that in order to be successful in competitive Pokemon you have to use hacked pokemon because nobody has the time to do soft resets for a perfect IV shiny groudon right that people with integrity who are like well it's impossible to have these truly competitive Pokemon but the winners are going to have those pokemon so I'm not going to compete at all right right yeah or you're like a lot of like a large portion of the fans of this show get their Pokemon through legit means but that's hundreds of hours that they spent doing that as opposed to learning the meta playing the field right like yeah yeah so Steven if you do like it's not impossible even if you do have the time and do you know dedicate that time you're still in some way you still end up behind because the people who used I don't even know what the kids use these days but like I use whatever software to get whatever the Pokemon they want they've been practicing that whole time yeah and I was I just going to say it's a huge statement about the current state of competitive Pokemon that one of the regionals I don't know if it was Madison or st. Louis there were only like 96 VGC masters in the cop 96 I've been to local competitions that had more than 96 people playing but nobody wants to play in this current format yeah I think it speaks volumes to the playerbase of Pokemon and it speaks dude type of game pokemon is if you remove the competitiveness of Pokemon you have a game where you have over 700 creatures that can be very drastically different whether that's v's or Ivy's or abilities or moves every creature can be so different and that's what pokemon originally wanted and I think they still want that and then you look at the competitive scene and players don't want that they want the best pokemon and they want it as fast as possible and there's a yeah but what's important is well there are all these variables to make to make it possible that every single Pokemon is going to be unique there's also by nature of a game being competitive people are going to play it enough to where they find out what the optimal configuration for that thing is that you might change next week when more people are running x pokemon then they were the week before so you end up with a different EV spread for this month but um but generally even though you can you could EV train your um your golem for special attack and a speed but that's not going to work like there is there is there are one or two correct answers for how should I EV train let's Pokemon for almost every Pokemon and I don't mean that in a way of like if you don't do it the way that the meta dictates you're doing it wrong I just mean that even though there are so many variables there's an extent to which there is a version of that Pokemon that performs better than other versions so even though they're all are these variables at tournaments it's going to tend towards a lot of the same type of thing yeah and I'll say two things to follow up on what Steve was saying number one when you have competitive top competitive players saying i only played the latest game until i got the mega stone and because that's all you needed to be part of the current competitive format and i didn't play any further well what does that really say about your love for pokemon that you couldn't even play the story mode all the way through to the end and then another thing that you know i think kind of detracts from really sharp criticism of the VGC format is that so many people are comfortable and happy playing in the smog on tears that they ignore or it takes pressure off of the BGC format for having to be a balanced and yeah inclusive environment because so many people like well i'm not gonna play crummy BGC i'll be happy playing smog on at my local league every week and and that's right that's not what I really that should not be what competitive Pokemon is oriented at they should really be oriented towards developing a BGC environment that's inclusive and exciting for people especially now that it's not even scholarships anymore its actual just a cash money payout yeah you know that should be open to as many people as want to be able to play it and not exclusive you have a you but there's a clear problem there has been for some time where you know we've we've seen it and there's been reports where and you mentioned it earlier where players go and they purposely lose so other players move up yeah and you know you can't stop that that's that's that happens in other games that's not exclusive to pokemon but you we there's a clear divide and it gets bigger and bigger every year of you have players that love and I'm not telling people how to play game if some people want to play only to mega stone and then you know competitive battle that that's there they paid for the game that's their right they can do whatever they want but in an audience sense you have people who who play the game who either love collecting Pokemon they love breeding pokemon they love strategizing and I know a ton of breeders who spend a lot of time to get perfect IV pokémon and then you have this other audience that doesn't care for that at all and I'm not saying they need to but you know they have hacked pokemon they're using hacked pokemon and they're good players I mean whether or not they have certain pokemon they're clearly performing at a level where other players cannot that does like the one audience is is following what pokemon originally intended for to have all these unique creatures that mean something to you and then you have this other audience that is completely destroying that in that mindset because they're so invested in competitiveness and I'm not saying one side is right and one side is wrong but it's a clear disconnect and I think where it comes from me and my personal opinion is I have a lot of Pokemon that that means something to me in a memory sense so for example one pokemon i have is the scraggy that you could get from worlds that happened and I think 2009-2010 I can't remember but I would have to be after 2010 because that's when black and white came out yep you're right maybe 2011 so I have this world with a scraggy that was exclusive to people who attended world and it means a lot to me I know exactly where it is my pokemon bank i have us I have a box for like event a specific Pokemon I I haven't done anything with it I haven't ever used in a battle I've never taught her to move it sits in my bank and it makes me happy to see it like I love it because it reminds me of worlds it reminds me of an event I was at this is an exclusive Pokemon no one has it and I can't say no one else has it because anyone who has been hacking Pokemon can look at that specific Pokemon and hacked an exact double right now and they also now have the world scraggy and that takes away so much from like the the charm and the exclusivity that Pokemon is supposed to bring can you hack those little those little ribbons that come with the ah yeah yeah you can yeah I'll teach you how to hack Pokemon after after we're done recording some people just like lie on purpose so I'm again like there is there is no easy answer there's but I think I think the three of us can agree on like if Pokemon wants to be considered seriously like they need they need to pick some some battle here they either need to you know they can't ban 15 people in Japan and then look at the United States world champion who clearly had hacked pokemon and just be okay with that like yeah what what makes this wrong and this right when at the end of the day 115 people got banned for hacked pokemon or in this case cheating and some end and this person didn't and so they need to pick a side they need to say like heck Pokemon are okay we we know that they exist we know that they're there they're just okay or they need to decide like they are not okay and in Pokemon Sun and Moon there's going to be extreme hack checks to make sure whether that's updating more frequently or requiring you to check the internet when you're doing like there has to be some kind of check or they just need to accept that hacked pokemon or the standard or they just add them at a sort of tournament game mode where you can edit Pokemon on the fly like they won't be you won't be able to use them in your single-player experience but you can just set level 100 Pokemon with the move sets you want sure opener for everyone therefore eliminating the need for perhaps like like a Pokemon Stadium only more customizable like pokemon showdown pixel a real thing right right because at this point like neither side is happy you have the the hackers that are saying like everyone else's opinion doesn't matter we're playing on skill and then you have the people who who care about Pokemon and who are spending the time going like this is unfair and this doesn't want me to play the game like you are segregating your audience because of competitive Pokemon battles and there needs to be a solution and I don't know if there will be but I can tell you the the two to three years I played competitive Pokemon it was not an enjoyable time well i still have fun because in our slack community we come up with wacky tournaments and i just enjoy having those wacky tournaments all right like my quick claw tournament but we will we will take a quick break I didn't realize how long that was going to run and we'll just come back and

effective will always be free we just thank everyone for their patronage and most importantly we thank all our listeners for just giving us a chance and actually listening to our podcast hope you enjoy the show and we are back and poke amount of the week but before we do that I do we were going to do a mini item of the week for and it is pretty much more of a like a public service announcement pokemon center com is now selling real pins I don't know if they came off the badge arcade fever here but just just for reference so so pins pins have gotten extremely popular I feel like the last two to three years like have you ever been to a pax uh it is pin city i feel i believe if you go to like a disney world they also are in the business of pins well it hasn't disney world always done that yeah yeah i I II III didn't know that though until the people the people who made pacts they were like yeah we blatantly sold this from Disney World like it does very well for disney world so we're doing it but pokemon center is now doing it you can get a four pack of pins that's a Pikachu Bulbasaur Charmander and squirtle what do you what do you think the prices on four pins like these are like your your metal your your shiny colored pins there's a word for it it's like that what that why they do the coloring what's the word for that Travis look at what i want to say cloyes own a is something like that if it sounds like even remotely that French I can guarantee you I don't know it um wow these are like they look like you know packs pins or Disney World pins I don't know what specific you know name they have they have like the outlines that are like super shiny but a 4-pack how much do you think that runs you four pins you know take them on your hat dirt ten dollars all right all right Travis what's your bid price is right he should I know it's gonna be like hi or whatever so I'll say I'll say like seven dollars for a four pack so if it was ten dollars or you're doing 250 a pin right yeah and if this is seven dollars you're doing like what a dollar fifty up in dollar sixty what if I told you four pins at pokemon center com a Charizard a Bulbasaur squirtle and a Pikachu was 24 99 you'd better get me some free shipping on that you want a 2-pack you want just magic-carpet gyarados 1299 that is half the price you want to you want a five pack you get a masterball a great ball a pokeball an ultra ball and a Pikachu special delivery five pins includes a lanyard for you to put the pins on 34 99 oh man but those dragon knight pins look sweet highway robbery the whimsicott pin with the substitute looks swag I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure packs pins are like 499 I think they're five dollars so that this is this is about 650 a pin at this point I don't know how much Disney World charges I'm sure it's in the five to eight dollar range but I can't justify that cost even for the Articuno Zapdos and Moltres oh man I look so good don't get me wrong they look awesome but like force that much for one pin and the possibility of like my my worry is like you put on a lanyard because that's what like they encourage like you go to a convention and you got this lanyard full of pins and look at how cool you are look at this peer pressure you got all these pins you need pens any pins you want to trade pins and like my fear my worry is like your lanyard gets caught on something or like the convention hall is busy and all of a sudden you get through the convention hall you're getting ready to eat your lunch and your master ball pin is missing because it's a pin and they could possibly fall off oh I'll tell you what's worse than that the enamel and that's what I was the word I was looking for enamel pins uh the enamel is gonna chip haha it's just it's just gonna chip because most people actually put these not on lanyards but they on their bags right everybody's been to a Pokemon event and people have bags full of different pins that they've gotten pokemon pins from different areas and stuff like that and chip chip chip that paint is going to go oh man that whimsicott would substitute look so good and I can I read one of the reviews on the EV and vaporeon Pokemon pins evo to pack I would love if you wrote a review this review comes to us from Manny em from newport rhode island and it's all a zero out of 39 people found this helpful perfect maybe maybe you'll think differently this is on caps so that's why I'm about to do the voice I am uh this is totaled where is jolteon and the review reads like to be boring on I want a Jolteon pin jolteon is the best solution I'm offended that you did not make a bin of my favorite pokemon i wish i could give this product oh gosh there's a recompete review button it doesn't oh ok it's not that far i wish if you give this product a zero maybe make a good product next time next time was this review helpful me let's take a poll out of just the three of us listening i'd like to i'd like to read a review of the vaporeon EV pin set if i may review is not helpful to pick this this review six out of eight people found the following review helpful the reviewer is t bleezy pokemon master from st. Louis Missouri and the title of the review goodbye psychother in you is buzz off Manny creep Oregon is my favorite Pokemon I'm buying this product just became you keep just because you gave a bad review PS i hope they never make a Jolteon because of your being ways this this is what fits do to us this is why we can't have nice things there's a war being waged in the comment search in the review section of pokemon center calm and t bleezy from st. Louis Missouri and Manny am from Newport Rhode Island are on the front line solutely I oh yeah the other review is just completely oblivious that they know it's not Oh be patient I'm sure they will release more in due time no need to give a product a bad review because you don't like the Pokemon chosen wow this reviewer has never been on the internet before her only pins bring out this type of anger and war between people and the assets that I've been waiting for this for a long time it's just sad that people feel the need to give this exciting product a bad review solely based on their facts their favorite pokemon isn't part of this set I bet ya new to the internet right I did I made uh I made these rubber trainer pins back in the day have one yet cool they uh they were cool they they were probably one of the coolest things I made uh they were also probably they were they probably would have done extremely well on Kickstarter this was a time before Kickstarter easy and I took a risk prehistory back in vintage pkmn cast times I took a risk paid a lot of money i got the pins made and in order to break even i had to charge i believe about seven dollars for a pin mm-hmm and then i had to charge about a dollar ninety to ship it so i was charging people about nine dollars flat to send these pins over the across the world and i think i had 250 of them made and i believe i made probably a profit about a dollar a pin so i mean i sold all the pins so ultimately i made like 200 bucks um uh off of this but too I felt bad I didn't think they would sell at seven dollars a pin I thought that was too much because i didn't think i would like i mean i sold it as as nine dollars for everything free shipping and stuff and you know what what really is the difference between eight and nine dollars yeah not much no one's going to no one's gonna be like you know if was a dollar cheaper I'd get it and that's probably what pokemon thing is thinking here you know they can charge what they want because they obviously know the supply and demand but like that was a rubber pin yeah I was gonna say it's a very difficult area lismore expelled like yeah you're saying the Pokemon Center materials more expensive right oh no I was thinking opposite because you're like your pin had like all of the different colors of rubber that needed to be included do when i went to get design when I away the unrolling when I got when I are quote price quotes they told me that this was the cheapest way to make a pin Oh interesting they they said like these pins that I'm looking at on Pokemon Center were actually some of the more expensive and so of course I went I went the cheap route and I was I was worried that they wouldn't be able to get the the detail and I think the trainer pin was very detailed yeah and and so if you know anything about ordering bulk the more you order the cheaper the product gets I don't have to imagine I just I just think that Pokemon Center is ordering more than 250 pins yeah yeah so they're their profit margins on these have to be through the roof like they have to be making money hand over fist by song a four pack of pins for 2499 hmm have to be anyway before we get into Pokemon a weak Pokemon Center to be at gencon Pokemon has a very big booth at gencon if you're going to gencon if you look at the gencon map Pokemon Center has a Pokemon that there's a square that is bigger than ever most other squares in the vendor hall and it says Pokemon and if you had click on it it takes you to pokemon center com i'm assuming pokemon center com is taking over that booth and they will be selling plushies and pins and all this stuff and they're probably just gonna rake in the money I mean will and I talked about this an episode or two ago but I feel like if I see these pins in person i'm going to buy them not handle how cool they are online boy that being said our pokemon of the week is Persian because this is this has become a if if you're not a cat you're not Pokemon of the week yeah there you go kitty cat cast Travis is a move set but before we do that Persian normally lives in towns and cities although popular for its elegance it is extremely difficult to raise as a pet due to its fickle and temperamental personality it will scratch anyone including its trainer with little or no provoke shin and it has been a vacation my fault provocation and it has been observed ripping its prey apart for no discernible reason however when a Persian is yanked by its whiskers it becomes temporarily dhakal hostile docile due to its unknown reasons I got temperamental right you got to give me some credit there there's a big word guys that an end fickle okay Travis don't you love the Meowth yes is one of my favorite Pokemon yeah Meowth is really cool how does that you missed you okay i was gonna say how does your love for me out transition into persian it does it's a short answer that question i like a boat I like me off a little more but versions cool too I normally look at the top smogon set just to give me an idea if with with these Pokemon that that you're not going to see every day unless you're playing like though some of the lower smogon tears or you're just playing with your friends like you're not likely to see a Persian so you like I tend to look at the smoke on set to see what kind of people have found for that Pokemon and I really don't like I mean it's probably the best thing you can do with a version right but I really don't like it thematically that sudden they recommend is nasty plot with hyper voice in power ghosts and either water pulse or substitute with a life orb and then taking advantage of the technische an ability with 252 and special attack and speed and you can do that but that feels wrong I he look at Persian and it doesn't feel like it should be a Pokemon it's doing special attacks that's just me let's take a slasher yeah yeah so that's what we're going to make instead we're going to do a physically attacking set which is going to be used fake out play rough it has technician so we're going to use bite and then the last move is you turn so what you can do here and then you're going to max out your speed and attack v's put a choice band on there or no not a choice band because I did fake out so in so you're going to put a life for bond there so what you can do is you're going to try to similar to what a pokemon like I gamba pom is the bus comparison where you have a very strong fake out from technician that's going to do more damage than your average fake-out is and then you finish it off with something like a u-turn or the light or the play rough so you're sort of designed for to hit kos as opposed to 18 Kos I didn't take the time to calculate what percentage of the field that you're likely to see would actually be to hit ko'd by such a pokemon but in theory if it shouldn't be too bad of a set and i would recommend that adamant nature since you're already pretty fast at 115 base speed I think I'd I think I'm done but the most important thing here is an Omega Ruby off the sapphire that there is a five percent chance that if you catch a Persian it will have a quick claw on it nice well then why did I say is life for me she's quickly that's not true shiny Persian extremely disappointing yeah even tell that it's shiny the way you can tell is it instead of a tan inside its ear it's it's like a pink inside anger yeah and it's just a little brighter yeah but that's it it's hard to tell even not even on the screen but the pink is what pokemon like this where I just think like who's in charge of making shinies right like like my might the first thing my mind goes to is Persian is naturally like a like a white a beige like an off-white yeah Wow like like why wouldn't you do like a black cat as the shiny yeah like it takes all I'd like granted that's a clever idea Steve but it doesn't take that long to get there I'm sorry shiny Meowth is even worse is it really yeah it's just a little darker there's not even any difference inside of the ears don't but they need to be fired whoever you are which I'm interest that was your job at the pokemon company international like like that is your sole job is I'm the person who like determines what the color differences are for the shinies because it's obviously nothing about the body type or anything it's just the color difference in person who the person who has decided these shiny colors are probably the same person that was like ah we need another water pokemon I'm just asking yeah no no that's just what I'm saying it's like right your job your only job is to determine what the shiny colors are and you're really bad at it and everybody knows it but it's like your uncle owns Pokemon without your only job yeah it is and and their uncle owns Pokemon and that's why they're you're never gonna get fired even though everybody plays out of their office and like they just like put their hand to their mouth I'm like oh my god can you believe what a terrible job this guy continues to do and the only reason he keeps his job is because his uncle's in charge the I can tell you one thing the the person in charge of Chinese is not a cat owner because they would have probably thought of a black cat as a shiny Persian instantly like that as that is your obvious go to for a shiny cat and if some of these are the shinies date back to Gen 2 so I in general the newer shinies if memory serves are a little butter yeah yeah I mean you've at all looks like bacon but you can't win them all yeah shiny unit okay can hardcore bacon um I trivia here Persians crystal sprite is different it's different from that of gold and silver making it one of the few Pokemon that have three distinctively different sprites and generation to uh yeah Jenny Eva tells bacon that's amazing it really is I mean like it looks dumb but at the same time it's also really cool that's that's what we asked for a year you know if you're gonna make it shiny at least make it memorable no one's going to forget that shine Eva tell looks like a slab of bacon and I think that is where we leave off I want to think i want to thank travis and will for being on yeah that i feel like this episode was it was back to roots like a solid original funny episode our listeners probably don't think so but I i think it was someone's gonna give this a one star of you and they're gonna say they drove us on this episode yeah Steve you've been listening to a lot of classic Pokemon podcast

there will be randomly be playing an old episode of it's super effective there's a chat there so you can chat with people there is an iOS app and Android app you can go right on the website actually this podcast is being live rock cast on mixer right now and we have six people listening I didn't really heavily advertised that I just wanted to see if it worked clearly does work so we can do more of this in the future but yeah and what's really amazing is when the old episodes are playing Steve can actually do a live feed of himself talking over the old episode and sometimes he'll do things where he talks into your left ear and sometimes he'll talk into your right ear and then sometimes he'll talk into the center of your head and you keep telling him you're in the middle of my head and he doesn't understand what that means I'm talking in here is this left ear is this like pokemon podcast ASMR I already made this joke I think so I think so okay I won't do it again well it's a very easier it's very it just think of it like a real radio station like radio DJs can talk over songs or whatever I have the ability to do that so we're gonna try it for a month if it you know if it doesn't catch on if people aren't using it I'll cancel the the monthly fee it costs for me to keep it up and running and but I for me I don't know it what what your guys's listening habits are but like I struggle when a service like Spotify goes tell me what you want to listen to like I I don't know and so I I like services more along the lines of Pandora where I can just say these are the three artists I've been digging give me music like that and and Pandora does that very well and it serves a need and that's why I listen to a lot of beats one because my know for the most part that's current popular music and I and I enjoy that so I just turn it on because i don't i don't want that choice because most the time i'm not even focus listening to it so when it comes to i was i was meeting with with some some podcast people about the show and the stats and everything and they were like you know for your podcast we've noticed that your your older episodes get listened to a lot i'm gonna have us like yeah i don't understand like that pokemon news isn't isn't relevant anymore i don't get why people would be listening to it but yeah they do pretty well and so I think I think that's um think that's it like a wall maybe for some newer listeners they go back and they go well with like 200 and some episodes I don't know where to start where I'd want to listen to and so I think the the mix ler I think the mix Lair is is like hey I don't know what I want to listen to but I want I want I want something Pokemon I'll just turn that on and and see what's playing and yeah I've listened to more I've listened to more episodes of it's super effective in the last three days than I have in like the last 3 years just because like like I'm just sitting there and I was like I wonder I wonder like I make these long playlist to play but you know four hours later I don't know what episode it's going to be honest it's like I wonder what's on the mixer and I turn it on it's like oh like this is the episode where where where Travis makes fun of kid and does a pretty good kid impression I do it really yeah I can't remember I was it was super funny it i don't know if it's sad or if it's something to say about the show we're like I'm laughing at like jokes from two years ago um yeah it Steve seems to find himself very funny i do I absolutely do think I'm hilarious and then he tells me about it yeah yeah and so yep uh yeah I I think the big flare is cool if you want to check it out you don't need an account you can just go to myxer.com /p cam and cast and you can see what's currently playing or what not but yeah as long as long as my computer is up and running the mix ler will be up and running so that that is that is something to listen to but I think I'm done rambling I don't think we have anything else guys you want to add me play overwatch with me the travis w hashtag 1876 because for some reason battle that requires that you have all simple
