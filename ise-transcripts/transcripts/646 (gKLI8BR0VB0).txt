I am recording I recording (0:01 - 0:05)
[Music] (0:05 - 0:19)
B what&#39;s up everyone welcome to the (0:15 - 0:22)
646 episode of the Pokemon podcast it&#39;s (0:19 - 0:24)
super effective I&#39;m your host Steve with (0:22 - 0:28)
me is Hannah I am here when we last (0:24 - 0:29)
recorded I don&#39;t think I really had (0:28 - 0:32)
concept ual IED how long a time it would (0:29 - 0:35)
be in between then and now but it&#39;s been (0:32 - 0:37)
a (0:35 - 0:37)
while it was only three episodes in one (0:39 - 0:48)
weekend it&#39;s kind a lot Bobby also here (0:43 - 0:54)
yeah uh I am back in my office I was in (0:48 - 0:56)
a garage for the last 3 (0:54 - 0:58)
weeks if you hadn&#39;t said that no one (0:56 - 1:01)
would know true but now I&#39;m here with (0:58 - 1:03)
pictures behind me more pictures behind (1:01 - 1:06)
me this is actually the first time in 3 (1:03 - 1:09)
weeks Bobby has left his garage he&#39;s (1:06 - 1:12)
back in (1:09 - 1:16)
mm uh yeah I was I was in Japan uh for (1:12 - 1:21)
two weeks for the (1:16 - 1:24)
Safari what was it Safari Zone wild area (1:21 - 1:27)
wild area oh yeah wild area not to be (1:24 - 1:29)
saari ball really good to you yeah there (1:27 - 1:32)
was a safari Ball but not for the Safari (1:29 - 1:34)
Zone it was for the wild a cuz that (1:32 - 1:36)
makes sense and don&#39;t confuse Safari (1:34 - 1:38)
Zone with City Safari those are (1:36 - 1:40)
different which is different than a (1:38 - 1:44)
Unova tour which but the it wasn&#39;t a (1:40 - 1:46)
Safari Ball Steve it was a go Safari (1:44 - 1:48)
Ball and we know that because of the (1:46 - 1:50)
giant go printed on the side of the (1:48 - 1:52)
Safari Ball and the fact that you can&#39;t (1:50 - 1:58)
transfer them well almost Fair uh yeah (1:52 - 2:00)
we&#39;ll I we&#39;ll probably talk a little bit (1:58 - 2:02)
about about that but because Niantic (2:00 - 2:03)
announced the Unova tour we&#39;re going to (2:02 - 2:06)
talk about that we have some more TCG (2:03 - 2:09)
pocket uh we have a whole schedule for (2:06 - 2:10)
the rest of the year for scarlet and (2:09 - 2:13)
violet leading up to Shiny Rayquaza so (2:10 - 2:16)
we&#39;re going to go through all that I (2:13 - 2:19)
know Ila is taking over Pokemon sleep (2:16 - 2:21)
and everyone is upset we will talk about (2:19 - 2:23)
that next (2:21 - 2:26)
week I know that that&#39;s a thing I know (2:23 - 2:30)
that is breaking news (2:26 - 2:32)
we just have a lot to talk about with (2:30 - 2:36)
yova tour pocket and the rest of scarlet (2:32 - 2:37)
and violet for the rest of the year (2:36 - 2:38)
because I don&#39;t think we&#39;re getting any (2:37 - 2:41)
more scarland Violet news after this (2:38 - 2:45)
giant dump maybe in January but I think (2:41 - 2:47)
I think they&#39;ve kind of like The Summer (2:45 - 2:49)
Event they kind of are like here&#39;s what (2:47 - 2:51)
you&#39;re getting so we&#39;ll go through all (2:49 - 2:52)
of (2:51 - 2:56)
that um yeah so that that&#39;s our show for (2:52 - 2:59)
the day I guess let&#39;s start off with the (2:56 - 3:03)
Pokemon ghost stuff there was the Safari (2:59 - 3:05)
Ball (3:03 - 3:10)
in the wild area mhm uh and then (3:05 - 3:13)
ultimately a couple days after wild area (3:10 - 3:16)
ended they announced Pokémon go Unova (3:13 - 3:19)
tour uh which I think the surprising (3:16 - 3:22)
thing here is what one I don&#39;t think (3:19 - 3:23)
anyone was surprised it was going back (3:22 - 3:28)
to LA because New York in February (3:23 - 3:31)
sounds miserable (3:28 - 3:34)
weatherwise uhuh yeah uh I but I think (3:31 - 3:36)
the surprise is not only are they doing (3:34 - 3:38)
it in LA but they&#39;re doing it in new (3:36 - 3:41)
Taipei City which is cool that they&#39;re (3:38 - 3:42)
doing it in two (3:41 - 3:44)
locations this (3:42 - 3:46)
time (3:44 - 3:51)
um before we dive too deep into that did (3:46 - 3:55)
you both participate in the wild area (3:51 - 3:59)
did you get wild in the area of the wild (3:55 - 4:02)
area (3:59 - 4:02)
Hannah you can start I this this was the (4:03 - 4:09)
biggest Pokemon event that I have not I (4:07 - 4:11)
barely participated (4:09 - 4:18)
in what I missed most of it oh no yeah I (4:11 - 4:20)
I don&#39;t had too many other things going (4:18 - 4:22)
on did not plan (4:20 - 4:24)
well I&#39;m going to have to trade for some (4:22 - 4:26)
of these Pokemon I (4:24 - 4:31)
think wow the like shinies or (4:26 - 4:32)
what or like the gigantamax what do you (4:31 - 4:35)
feel you&#39;re missing (4:32 - 4:37)
toxcity mostly toxcity (4:35 - 4:41)
toxil uh I would I really didn&#39;t want to (4:37 - 4:43)
miss out on like the the Dynamax and (4:41 - 4:45)
seeing all of the raids but I I opened (4:43 - 4:49)
the app maybe a couple of times did you (4:45 - 4:53)
buy a ticket I might have oh no the (4:49 - 4:54)
ultimate (4:53 - 4:57)
sin wins again and then I (4:54 - 5:01)
forgot yeah oh (4:57 - 5:03)
yeah really lost out on this one what a (5:01 - 5:07)
Twist what a Twist I did not expect (5:03 - 5:10)
that had a lot going on yeah still kind (5:07 - 5:11)
of yeah that&#39;s fine that&#39;s fine I mean (5:10 - 5:13)
that&#39;s understandable TCG pocket has (5:11 - 5:16)
been most of my mobile Pokemon gaming (5:13 - 5:18)
time at this point honestly that was the (5:16 - 5:21)
a lot going on she was just TCG pocket (5:18 - 5:25)
for days riding out for promo (5:21 - 5:28)
packs looking for that gold Mewtwo so (5:25 - 5:32)
that I can grind it up that&#39;s right uh (5:28 - 5:33)
we&#39;ll talk about that after the break (5:32 - 5:36)
the pocket stuff um Bobby how was your (5:33 - 5:40)
wild area in sunny California yeah uh it (5:36 - 5:43)
was uh it was really fun actually I will (5:40 - 5:47)
say I enjoyed so I wasn&#39;t planning on (5:43 - 5:50)
playing it a whole bunch and but I (5:47 - 5:52)
decided to take a couple hours on but (5:50 - 5:53)
you heard Hannah wasn&#39;t playing so (5:52 - 5:55)
you&#39;re like I got to make up for I got (5:53 - 5:58)
to make up for her exactly exactly so I (5:55 - 6:01)
took a couple hours on S Saturday and (5:58 - 6:05)
went over to my local park which in (6:01 - 6:07)
Pokémon go terms it&#39;s like the mall of (6:05 - 6:09)
Amer it&#39;s like Steve&#39;s Mall of America (6:07 - 6:11)
like it&#39;s the place where you go to play (6:09 - 6:12)
and there&#39;s just a bunch of stuff (6:11 - 6:14)
happening like there&#39;s a bunch of stops (6:12 - 6:16)
a bunch of gyms there&#39;s a bunch of (6:14 - 6:20)
people there always for these events so (6:16 - 6:22)
decided to go over there I had no (6:20 - 6:24)
intention of doing a gigantamax raid (6:22 - 6:26)
because again I&#39;m wasn&#39;t meeting up with (6:24 - 6:28)
people I didn&#39;t think we&#39;d be able to do (6:26 - 6:31)
it and I actually got ax a gigant Max (6:28 - 6:34)
toxcity like I was kind of surprised um (6:31 - 6:37)
had to do a couple of them the first one (6:34 - 6:41)
we had 22 people and lost in like a (6:37 - 6:45)
minute and a half because no one knew I (6:41 - 6:46)
I wasn&#39;t I had no idea who anybody else (6:45 - 6:48)
was in The Raid I can answer this for (6:46 - 6:50)
you Bobby no one knows type weakness or (6:48 - 6:52)
resistance so they&#39;re bringing (6:50 - 6:54)
Charizards who are weak to electric and (6:52 - 6:57)
they&#39;re bringing Sables also weak to (6:54 - 7:00)
Electric to a toxcity rate I that&#39;s (6:57 - 7:03)
exactly what happened so I that failed (7:00 - 7:05)
and I was like you know what I again I&#39;m (7:03 - 7:07)
not going to try this again like I (7:05 - 7:10)
whatever so I continued playing and then (7:07 - 7:12)
later got to another gym and tried it (7:10 - 7:15)
again only 17 people this time but we (7:12 - 7:20)
beat it and it was I was surprised (7:15 - 7:22)
because I was like what like that&#39;s not (7:20 - 7:24)
supposed to work that way was that your (7:22 - 7:26)
first gigantamax success my first (7:24 - 7:28)
gigantamax that was my second gigantamax (7:26 - 7:30)
raid ever my first one was the tox (7:28 - 7:32)
electricity from an hour prior oh that&#39;s (7:30 - 7:34)
crazy yeah cuz I didn&#39;t do Gengar and I (7:32 - 7:38)
didn&#39;t go out for the three starters um (7:34 - 7:40)
so that was cool I was the only person (7:38 - 7:43)
on my team of four uh using anything (7:40 - 7:44)
other than an attack and again I didn&#39;t (7:43 - 7:46)
know who anyone else was I I was just I (7:44 - 7:50)
was just in a you know the tank so yeah (7:46 - 7:52)
um I don&#39;t know why at this point I (7:50 - 7:54)
would ever power up (7:52 - 7:57)
Max strike or attack because I&#39;ve only (7:54 - 8:00)
ever hit Max guard and Max (7:57 - 8:03)
because El nobody else does but when you (8:00 - 8:06)
hit it you&#39;re like we&#39;re winning because (8:03 - 8:09)
of this it&#39;s because of me (8:06 - 8:13)
exactly exactly uh so so that was cool (8:09 - 8:15)
uh I will say okay so I think there&#39;s (8:13 - 8:17)
the big Pro for me was I thought the (8:15 - 8:19)
mighty Pokemon were really cool like I (8:17 - 8:22)
thought how how good their stats were (8:19 - 8:25)
and how highlevel they were was awesome (8:22 - 8:27)
so it&#39;s like oh I have like a mammo (8:25 - 8:28)
swine that&#39;s just raid ready like I (8:27 - 8:30)
don&#39;t have to like do anything to it (8:28 - 8:32)
it&#39;s just ready to like raid now uh same (8:30 - 8:34)
with a couple other things it was just (8:32 - 8:37)
nice and then having those Safari balls (8:34 - 8:39)
you could catch them really easily uh I (8:37 - 8:42)
will say like paid ticket versus (8:39 - 8:44)
non-paid seemed like a huge difference (8:42 - 8:45)
because at the end of each day I had (8:44 - 8:48)
like 150 Safari balls and then I heard (8:45 - 8:51)
people that were like I had two for the (8:48 - 8:52)
for the day or something and it was like (8:51 - 8:56)
oh okay like so that seemed like maybe a (8:52 - 9:01)
little off between and um like (8:56 - 9:01)
disclosure Niantic did not pay for me to (9:02 - 9:06)
I wish they did they did not pay for me (9:05 - 9:08)
to go to Japan they did not pay for my (9:06 - 9:10)
flight or my hotel that was all out of (9:08 - 9:12)
my own money which is funny cuz they did (9:10 - 9:14)
pay for me to go to (9:12 - 9:18)
Jakarta and I think and that was an (9:14 - 9:20)
expensive trip cuz they Niantic loves to (9:18 - 9:21)
wait last minute to pay for things and (9:20 - 9:22)
then they&#39;re like this is kind of (9:21 - 9:24)
expensive and I&#39;m like you kind of (9:22 - 9:27)
waited last minute um uh but like I (9:24 - 9:30)
think this event was one of of the best (9:27 - 9:32)
events this (9:30 - 9:34)
year uh (9:32 - 9:36)
personally okay and I don&#39;t think it was (9:34 - 9:38)
because I was in Japan specifically cuz (9:36 - 9:40)
some people were like do you think you (9:38 - 9:43)
had a better experience like in walking (9:40 - 9:45)
around Tokyo than you did at Mall of (9:43 - 9:46)
America and honestly I think M of (9:45 - 9:49)
America is still a better (9:46 - 9:51)
experience um excuse (9:49 - 9:55)
me well (9:51 - 9:55)
like where I originally played I I (9:55 - 10:04)
started off at the Mega Pokemon (9:59 - 10:07)
Mega Pokemon Pokemon Center Mega Tokyo (10:04 - 10:09)
that&#39;s what it is the name of it that (10:07 - 10:11)
one that one it is the biggest Pokemon (10:09 - 10:14)
Center in Tokyo I wanted to start there (10:11 - 10:16)
because on Saturday they were launching (10:14 - 10:18)
the gold and silver merchandise for the (10:16 - 10:22)
25th year and I was like and I was (10:18 - 10:24)
talking to my friend Julie who lives in (10:22 - 10:26)
Japan and she was like it&#39;s impossible (10:24 - 10:28)
you won&#39;t be able to get it she&#39;s like (10:26 - 10:30)
everyone who waits in l line is just (10:28 - 10:33)
resellers and I was like ah capitalism (10:30 - 10:35)
this this is we have this in America too (10:33 - 10:38)
Julie like this is not do they not have (10:35 - 10:41)
a lottery uh they do not have a lottery (10:38 - 10:44)
for this launch interesting uh and I (10:41 - 10:45)
went to I&#39;ve been to this Pokemon Center (10:44 - 10:47)
many times I was actually at the Pokemon (10:45 - 10:49)
Center like the day before (10:47 - 10:53)
um and it was like pretty empty cuz it (10:49 - 10:55)
was like 7 o&#39;clock at night this mall (10:53 - 10:56)
for what also for whatever reason this (10:55 - 10:58)
mall closes at 8 which like most malls (10:56 - 11:00)
close at like 9ine (10:58 - 11:02)
but (11:00 - 11:06)
um I was like I just want to (11:02 - 11:09)
see what a launch of a new merchandise (11:06 - 11:11)
line Looks like at a Pokemon Center the (11:09 - 11:14)
event starts at 10:00 the mall opens at (11:11 - 11:18)
10: also that Pokemon Center has like (11:14 - 11:20)
three gems that mall in total has like (11:18 - 11:22)
five gems and then there&#39;s a bunch of (11:20 - 11:24)
gems around it I was like it has to be (11:22 - 11:26)
like a decent place to start cuz I don&#39;t (11:24 - 11:30)
know where in Tokyo to ideally (11:26 - 11:31)
like I I I guess I could have went to (11:30 - 11:33)
like a subreddit or something and like (11:31 - 11:35)
looked it up but I was like I just want (11:33 - 11:38)
to kind of I want to start here um it (11:35 - 11:41)
was indeed a great place to play because (11:38 - 11:43)
when I got to that Pokemon Center Not (11:41 - 11:46)
only was there a line wrapped around the (11:43 - 11:48)
entire Pokemon Center it was wrapped (11:46 - 11:52)
around the entire Pokemon Center four (11:48 - 11:57)
times all the way around it was insane (11:52 - 11:59)
and when you got into the Pokémon Center (11:57 - 12:01)
it was was just another line it wasn&#39;t (11:59 - 12:03)
like you got in and you could like shop (12:01 - 12:06)
it was like you got in and you waited in (12:03 - 12:09)
aine the only reason you were going (12:06 - 12:10)
yeah (12:09 - 12:14)
um a like just like absolutely insane I (12:10 - 12:17)
was told that that&#39;s one of the worst (12:14 - 12:20)
malls to go to for a new launch because (12:17 - 12:23)
the mall will open early for Mall (12:20 - 12:25)
Walkers yeah whereas other malls will (12:23 - 12:27)
like no one can get in until the whole (12:25 - 12:30)
Mall opens which is but then you&#39;re just (12:27 - 12:31)
waiting in a giant line out right (12:30 - 12:34)
outside the door of the mall anyway (12:31 - 12:37)
right like I yeah I don&#39;t know so but um (12:34 - 12:39)
it was really cool to see uh and I was (12:37 - 12:41)
able to do plenty of (12:39 - 12:44)
toxicities uh and then that&#39;s (12:41 - 12:47)
like the the weird I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s (12:44 - 12:50)
a weird thing but (12:47 - 12:50)
like I don&#39;t think anyone likes to do (12:50 - 12:56)
an8 hour event in the same location (12:53 - 12:58)
maybe if you&#39;re like a hardcore grinder (12:56 - 13:01)
and you are just like head down I want (12:58 - 13:03)
as many shinies as possible this is the (13:01 - 13:05)
optimal like I want to min max this (13:03 - 13:08)
event maybe yeah like you you&#39;re with a (13:05 - 13:12)
good group of friends and have a picnic (13:08 - 13:12)
prepared I think that&#39;s the only time (13:12 - 13:18)
but like I I was I was probably there (13:15 - 13:22)
for maybe in ibukuro uh which is the the (13:18 - 13:24)
city it&#39;s in I was probably there for (13:22 - 13:28)
maybe like 3ish hours and then I had (13:24 - 13:29)
like a small problem with my stream back (13:28 - 13:31)
backpack and I was like okay well I&#39;m (13:29 - 13:33)
just going to go back to the hotel and (13:31 - 13:35)
drop some stuff off and then fix the (13:33 - 13:37)
stream backpack that&#39;ll be like 10 (13:35 - 13:38)
minutes and I&#39;m going to go somewhere (13:37 - 13:41)
else and I was like oh there&#39;s an anchor (13:38 - 13:42)
store in (13:41 - 13:44)
haruku uh they sell like exclusive (13:42 - 13:47)
Pokemon anchor merchandise I was like (13:44 - 13:49)
maybe I&#39;ll just run there and see if (13:47 - 13:50)
they have it that&#39; be fun for stream I (13:49 - 13:53)
could show stream like also har anduku (13:50 - 13:55)
is like a very busy place and what right (13:53 - 13:59)
went there an absolute Nightmare on (13:55 - 14:00)
Saturday (13:59 - 14:03)
there was a line to get into the train (14:00 - 14:05)
station to get onto the Train the line (14:03 - 14:09)
was outside to get in uh I like I&#39;ve (14:05 - 14:11)
never seen it so busy and it was (14:09 - 14:13)
actually like there were still like (14:11 - 14:15)
toxicity raids and stuff when I was in (14:13 - 14:17)
by the Pokemon Center all filling up (14:15 - 14:21)
instant 40 instant 40 instant 40 I (14:17 - 14:22)
couldn&#39;t even get 20 people in har (14:21 - 14:25)
anduku even though I couldn&#39;t walk like (14:22 - 14:27)
there were just so many people like it (14:25 - 14:30)
was like (14:27 - 14:31)
like demographic wise probably like (14:30 - 14:34)
obviously the the giant mall with the (14:31 - 14:35)
biggest Pokemon Center would have a (14:34 - 14:37)
bunch of Pokemon fans that are doing (14:35 - 14:40)
this where like this very (14:37 - 14:43)
touristy street food location with it&#39;s (14:40 - 14:47)
more like fashion based uh has people (14:43 - 14:51)
playing Pokemon but more tourists than (14:47 - 14:53)
Pokemon players I don&#39;t know so like (14:51 - 14:55)
that was like an hour or two hours of my (14:53 - 14:57)
day and then I don&#39;t remember where we (14:55 - 14:59)
went and again it was like an okay place (14:57 - 15:03)
to play but I think like the benefit of (14:59 - 15:04)
Mall of America and why like somebody (15:03 - 15:05)
came in and was like do you think this (15:04 - 15:07)
is better than Mall of America cuz I was (15:05 - 15:08)
like going all over the (15:07 - 15:11)
place and I think like M America works (15:08 - 15:15)
because the spawn density is so high and (15:11 - 15:18)
M America is just big enough where when (15:15 - 15:21)
you complete an entire circle everything (15:18 - 15:23)
resets cuz it&#39;s been long enough for the (15:21 - 15:25)
circle and so it&#39;s nice because M (15:23 - 15:28)
America also has like seven or eight (15:25 - 15:30)
gems and then like (15:28 - 15:32)
eight Dynamax spawns so like when (15:30 - 15:35)
something pops there&#39;s not like it&#39;s (15:32 - 15:36)
like oh it&#39;s only going to take me like (15:35 - 15:38)
five minutes to walk to that side (15:36 - 15:40)
whereas like when you&#39;re in a (15:38 - 15:43)
city uh it&#39;s like ah well I have to wait (15:40 - 15:45)
for the street to cross and then like (15:43 - 15:47)
timers are a lot shorter cuz I think (15:45 - 15:49)
most of the raids were what like 15 20 (15:47 - 15:51)
minutes before they rotated out and it&#39;s (15:49 - 15:52)
like I don&#39;t know if I can get there in (15:51 - 15:54)
time something like that yeah uh (15:52 - 15:57)
especially with like gigantamax raids (15:54 - 16:00)
cuz like even if you have 40 people and (15:57 - 16:02)
some of them are bad you&#39;re like I&#39;m in (16:00 - 16:04)
this gigantic Max raid for like 5 to six (16:02 - 16:07)
minutes before like when all is said and (16:04 - 16:08)
done right you have to wait for the (16:07 - 16:09)
timer you go through the motions of the (16:08 - 16:11)
raid you go through the catch screen and (16:09 - 16:12)
then all of a sudden you&#39;re like okay (16:11 - 16:14)
that&#39;s been like a full seven minutes (16:12 - 16:16)
from start to stop and you&#39;re like I (16:14 - 16:18)
don&#39;t know if I can get to this Snorlax (16:16 - 16:19)
raid (16:18 - 16:21)
that&#39;s you know five blocks away that&#39;s (16:19 - 16:26)
going to end in six minutes right um (16:21 - 16:28)
yeah that has nothing to do with the EV (16:26 - 16:31)
the event itself was good (16:28 - 16:31)
the event was good except for I think (16:32 - 16:36)
the one con that I didn&#39;t I had for the (16:34 - 16:40)
event was I didn&#39;t like the lack of (16:36 - 16:43)
Spawn diversity so age I knew going into (16:40 - 16:45)
this it was like okay it&#39;s only going to (16:43 - 16:46)
be poison types it&#39;s only going to be (16:45 - 16:49)
Electric types I&#39;m okay with even that (16:46 - 16:50)
like I&#39;m okay with them having like kept (16:49 - 16:52)
it like focused on two types cuz (16:50 - 16:54)
obviously it&#39;s just like toxicity is a (16:52 - 16:56)
theme and they want to do poison (16:54 - 16:59)
electric but there are a lot of poison (16:56 - 17:00)
we know there are a lot of poison (16:59 - 17:03)
Pokemon in the in Pokemon and there are (17:00 - 17:06)
a lot of electric Pokemon I feel like (17:03 - 17:08)
cuz what it was it was like one hour of (17:06 - 17:09)
poison one hour of electric for the (17:08 - 17:11)
whole eight hours and then the next day (17:09 - 17:13)
the whole eight hours was again one hour (17:11 - 17:15)
poison one hour of electric I feel like (17:13 - 17:17)
they doing that also not moving (17:15 - 17:19)
locations for 8 hours the same location (17:17 - 17:21)
for eight hours and you have the same (17:19 - 17:25)
spawns for8 hours right so I feel like (17:21 - 17:26)
cuz people some people were saying like (17:25 - 17:28)
oh they could have switched them for day (17:26 - 17:29)
two and it&#39;s like N I don&#39;t know that (17:28 - 17:30)
would have been good if you couldn&#39;t (17:29 - 17:33)
only play one of the days but like they (17:30 - 17:35)
could have done like poison group one in (17:33 - 17:37)
1 hour and then electric group one and (17:35 - 17:39)
then a new group of poison Pokemon or (17:37 - 17:41)
something there are so many they could (17:39 - 17:43)
have done it didn&#39;t need to just be like (17:41 - 17:45)
nine poison Pokemon and nine electric (17:43 - 17:47)
Pokemon the entire and there were a lot (17:45 - 17:50)
that had had Community Days yeah so (17:47 - 17:51)
there were a lot that people just (17:50 - 17:53)
weren&#39;t as interested in when it comes (17:51 - 17:55)
to the spawn pool I&#39;m also convinced (17:53 - 17:57)
that Marini was not boosted compared to (17:55 - 17:59)
everyone else I&#39;m just that&#39;s a I can&#39;t (17:57 - 18:03)
prove that but did you not get a Marini (17:59 - 18:05)
did you not get a thing I got one Marini (18:03 - 18:06)
out of four days of playing cuz I went (18:05 - 18:10)
to the the inperson obviously and the (18:06 - 18:12)
and the not um there&#39;s a couple things (18:10 - 18:14)
about the event that stand out to me uh (18:12 - 18:16)
one I (18:14 - 18:18)
think oh I why I brought up Niantic (18:16 - 18:20)
didn&#39;t pay for any of my stuff is one I (18:18 - 18:22)
I like to do that disclosure but two I (18:20 - 18:25)
did pay for the extra Ultra extra Safari (18:22 - 18:27)
Ball bonus the $2 for like four I think (18:25 - 18:31)
it was four extra look was it a waste of (18:27 - 18:33)
money yes have I wasted money on worse (18:31 - 18:37)
things totally like for $2 it&#39;s (18:33 - 18:41)
like innocent enough where I didn&#39;t feel (18:37 - 18:43)
like completely ripped off yeah but I (18:41 - 18:47)
also ended each day with 60 plus Safari (18:43 - 18:50)
balls yeahh (18:47 - 18:53)
so the last hour of almost every day I (18:50 - 18:54)
was just I&#39;m just going to catch (18:53 - 18:56)
everything in Safari Ball cuz I&#39;m just (18:54 - 18:59)
burning through and that was nice it was (18:56 - 19:01)
like a nice luxury to have because it (18:59 - 19:04)
was almost guaranteed catch for every (19:01 - 19:07)
common Pokemon so you&#39;re just you&#39;re (19:04 - 19:09)
just fast catching the last hour and (19:07 - 19:11)
just burn ripping through these Safari (19:09 - 19:13)
balls so that was like (19:11 - 19:15)
nice I don&#39;t think it&#39;s that harmful (19:13 - 19:17)
like I maybe other people have optimized (19:15 - 19:21)
their Safari balls but getting an extra (19:17 - 19:24)
four for eight hours for the entire (19:21 - 19:27)
weekend was it was it was fine like I I (19:24 - 19:30)
think 99% of people don&#39;t need to spend (19:27 - 19:33)
that $2 and if you did spend that $2 (19:30 - 19:35)
again I think it was a better deal than (19:33 - 19:36)
like two (19:35 - 19:41)
poffins the store yeah I I know that a (19:36 - 19:42)
lot of people had issue with the fact (19:41 - 19:44)
that like the Safari Ball Pokemon don&#39;t (19:42 - 19:47)
transfer to home and so there was a lot (19:44 - 19:51)
of talk about that I think I get it you (19:47 - 19:52)
want like you some people want to you (19:51 - 19:54)
know they catch something they want to (19:52 - 19:55)
transfer it to home like personally like (19:54 - 19:57)
especially with like the mighty Pokemon (19:55 - 19:59)
it&#39;s like the main purpose for those to (19:57 - 20:01)
me is for things like rating like for (19:59 - 20:03)
things that are going to happen in (20:01 - 20:05)
Pokémon go like I can get all of those (20:03 - 20:08)
Pokemon in other Pokemon games and then (20:05 - 20:12)
have them in home but it&#39;s like I get (20:08 - 20:14)
that you know oh well now it&#39;s in a (20:12 - 20:16)
Safari Ball I can&#39;t transfer it to home (20:14 - 20:18)
but for me it&#39;s like most of that&#39;s (20:16 - 20:19)
going to be used on go anyway and I feel (20:18 - 20:22)
like a lot of go players are probably in (20:19 - 20:26)
a similar like in a similar way like I (20:22 - 20:28)
would say a lot of go players play (20:26 - 20:31)
Pokemon go and maybe maybe play other (20:28 - 20:32)
things but I don&#39;t know how many like (20:31 - 20:34)
what the ratio of go players who are (20:32 - 20:37)
also like Pokemon home subscribers are I (20:34 - 20:39)
feel like that&#39;s might be on the Lower (20:37 - 20:41)
Side honestly I don&#39;t think the ball (20:39 - 20:44)
thing is that big of a deal like I&#39;m (20:41 - 20:46)
sure it will eventually (20:44 - 20:49)
update are you maybe not though a (20:46 - 20:52)
million yes (20:49 - 20:57)
like it&#39;s a new Pokeball that (20:52 - 21:00)
ilka has to like accept and program (20:57 - 21:01)
right and you can make the argument of (21:00 - 21:03)
like well they saw it coming they should (21:01 - 21:06)
know that they it&#39;s coming pole has been (21:03 - 21:09)
in the game for like 10 years cosmog has (21:06 - 21:10)
been in the game for like 10 years and (21:09 - 21:12)
you could not transfer those from go to (21:10 - 21:15)
that because ilka has to like go into (21:12 - 21:17)
home and like approve the transfer and (21:15 - 21:19)
all that stuff and like what was it poal (21:17 - 21:21)
we had to wait like a month for Cosmo we (21:19 - 21:23)
had to wait like two months for before (21:21 - 21:25)
they got approved for (21:23 - 21:28)
transfer oh I didn&#39;t even realize that I (21:25 - 21:30)
don&#39;t like wasn&#39;t there a different (21:28 - 21:31)
reason for those not being able to be (21:30 - 21:33)
transferred though you could you could (21:31 - 21:36)
like argue that it was like story reason (21:33 - 21:37)
yeah because you needed to have the (21:36 - 21:40)
Pokemon to continue the research story (21:37 - 21:41)
you didn&#39;t need (21:40 - 21:45)
[Laughter] (21:41 - 21:48)
to but we&#39;re also up to like what like (21:45 - 21:51)
three or four cosmog now at this point (21:48 - 21:55)
yeah um not enough not enough coso (21:51 - 21:57)
that&#39;s for sure but like those two (21:55 - 21:59)
examples there there are plenty there (21:57 - 22:01)
are probably more examples of Pokemon (21:59 - 22:06)
that could not be transferred over right (22:01 - 22:09)
away maybe yeah but this is slightly (22:06 - 22:10)
different with the Pokeball being the (22:09 - 22:13)
issue they never really fully integated (22:10 - 22:15)
the games have like three hundred (22:13 - 22:17)
different Pokeballs you&#39;re telling me (22:15 - 22:21)
that like leg arus ones but they do work (22:17 - 22:23)
with the Legends archus ones but they (22:21 - 22:26)
change yes exactly so will this just (22:23 - 22:29)
change into a strange ball yeah that&#39;s (22:26 - 22:31)
all they have to do like everything is (22:29 - 22:33)
there they just have to turn it (22:31 - 22:35)
on (22:33 - 22:37)
but I guess the way I was seeing the goh (22:35 - 22:39)
Safari Ball was that they made that (22:37 - 22:40)
specifically because they didn&#39;t want (22:39 - 22:42)
these Pokemon to be transferred for some (22:40 - 22:43)
reason that otherwise they would have (22:42 - 22:47)
just put it in a standard Safari Ball no (22:43 - 22:49)
I don&#39;t well maybe I see that but I (22:47 - 22:50)
don&#39;t (22:49 - 22:54)
because like I don&#39;t think that (22:50 - 22:57)
they oh maybe because when you guess (22:54 - 22:59)
when you recatch it and so the the you (22:57 - 23:01)
can do which people figured out is that (22:59 - 23:04)
you can transfer these Pokemon to let&#39;s (23:01 - 23:07)
go Pikachu let&#39;s go Eevee if they are um (23:04 - 23:10)
Kanto Pokemon right so there&#39;s like or (23:07 - 23:12)
meltan ah seea not (23:10 - 23:16)
involved look at that look at the signs (23:12 - 23:18)
right but the thing about let&#39;s go (23:16 - 23:19)
Pikachu let&#39;s go Eevee is when you (23:18 - 23:22)
transfer them in you have to recatch (23:19 - 23:23)
them so you&#39;re Rec catching them in a (23:22 - 23:26)
ball from that game and then they can (23:23 - 23:29)
then be transferred to home and on to (23:26 - 23:31)
the newer games at that point so uh if (23:29 - 23:33)
you have Pokemon that can go into let&#39;s (23:31 - 23:34)
go Pikachu let&#39;s go Eevee and they&#39;re in (23:33 - 23:37)
a Safar go Safari Ball right now you can (23:34 - 23:40)
transfer them to that game I don&#39;t feel (23:37 - 23:44)
like that was like a missed Thing by the (23:40 - 23:45)
company like I don&#39;t think they were (23:44 - 23:47)
like oh we didn&#39;t think of that when (23:45 - 23:51)
they did this so I I do wonder why and (23:47 - 23:52)
so Steve you just think they&#39;re going to (23:51 - 23:54)
do it eventually you think they just (23:52 - 23:56)
haven&#39;t coded it in on the home side yet (23:54 - 23:59)
as soon as like whatever the next major (23:56 - 24:00)
update to Pokemon home is they&#39;ll be (23:59 - 24:03)
like you can transfer it over now okay (24:00 - 24:05)
well I guess we will see that be I I I (24:03 - 24:07)
don&#39;t what why why would they not let (24:05 - 24:09)
you transfer it (24:07 - 24:13)
over no too much work too (24:09 - 24:13)
much yes they&#39;re like we&#39;re taking over (24:14 - 24:20)
Pokemon sleeve we can&#39;t passively manage (24:17 - 24:23)
one extra (24:20 - 24:26)
ball I I guess I don&#39;t know I yeah I (24:23 - 24:27)
don&#39;t know why well I think that&#39;s why (24:26 - 24:29)
people were so uh frustrated about it (24:27 - 24:32)
cuz like exactly why like it doesn&#39;t (24:29 - 24:34)
make any sense they&#39;re not special (24:32 - 24:38)
Pokemon or anything it&#39;s just the ball (24:34 - 24:43)
why not have it go over to home but I (24:38 - 24:45)
we&#39;ll see I guess I guess Safari balls (24:43 - 24:48)
are a limited resource that they don&#39;t (24:45 - 24:52)
want to have more of in there I&#39;ve (24:48 - 24:55)
limited again I had 150 per day that I (24:52 - 24:58)
was ending with no I meant I meant in (24:55 - 24:59)
the main (24:58 - 25:02)
yeah sure right well again I think they (24:59 - 25:04)
it&#39;s not a safari ball right so I really (25:02 - 25:05)
do think like it would become like a (25:04 - 25:08)
strange ball or something yeah at this (25:05 - 25:09)
point I do think that it would become a (25:08 - 25:11)
strange ball and I think that&#39;s why they (25:09 - 25:13)
made it the the go Safari Ball and not (25:11 - 25:15)
just the standard one and the text they (25:13 - 25:17)
wanted that nice big go on the side of (25:15 - 25:21)
the Safari Ball I don&#39;t like (25:17 - 25:25)
the adding I I don&#39;t know what the (25:21 - 25:28)
actual logical reason of like needing to (25:25 - 25:30)
add the word go (25:28 - 25:36)
to the Pokeball is but like we are eight (25:30 - 25:38)
years into this game and how many (25:36 - 25:41)
pokeballs do we really have and there&#39;s (25:38 - 25:42)
like so many more (25:41 - 25:46)
pokeballs to come and I think Niantic (25:42 - 25:48)
realized it took him long enough to (25:46 - 25:50)
realize that like Beast balls were just (25:48 - 25:55)
cool MH uh and so like if you want to (25:50 - 25:57)
make an event fancy you can like just be (25:55 - 26:00)
like well this event is like the luxury (25:57 - 26:01)
event and for the first time ever you (26:00 - 26:04)
can have luxury balls and like I don&#39;t (26:01 - 26:06)
think yeah they found another thing they (26:04 - 26:08)
can drip feed yes yes and I don&#39;t think (26:06 - 26:11)
it&#39;s going to be like well we got all of (26:08 - 26:13)
these balls to work and now we have this (26:11 - 26:15)
goh Safari Ball that one doesn&#39;t work (26:13 - 26:17)
but when we do introduce luxury ball and (26:15 - 26:19)
heel ball and netball those will all (26:17 - 26:20)
work I just don&#39;t think there will be (26:19 - 26:22)
like one Pokeball that suddenly like (26:20 - 26:24)
restricts half your collection to go (26:22 - 26:26)
into Pokemon home I just don&#39;t think (26:24 - 26:29)
that&#39;s like a like a realistic thing (26:26 - 26:31)
yeah I yeah I don&#39;t know the GOI ball (26:29 - 26:34)
thing is weird I I for one am glad that (26:31 - 26:35)
it was there because if I didn&#39;t see the (26:34 - 26:37)
go on the side of the Safari Ball I (26:35 - 26:38)
would have thought I was playing scarlet (26:37 - 26:40)
and violet yeah yeah they don&#39;t they (26:38 - 26:42)
don&#39;t want that the lack of confusion (26:40 - 26:45)
there by seeing that I do want to say (26:42 - 26:47)
that I I (26:45 - 26:52)
since uh I did uh 55 (26:47 - 26:56)
gigantamax toxtricity wild uh for for (26:52 - 26:57)
that (26:56 - 27:00)
event uh (26:57 - 27:04)
um I don&#39;t know what it is (27:00 - 27:04)
about (27:06 - 27:11)
people we just add the sentence (27:08 - 27:14)
there I&#39;m like standing in akih Habra (27:11 - 27:17)
and I&#39;m like doing a toxtricity I&#39;m with (27:14 - 27:20)
I&#39;m with a friend and I&#39;m like and she (27:17 - 27:22)
doesn&#39;t want to do any toxtricity she&#39;s (27:20 - 27:24)
like I&#39;m not giving Niantic any more (27:22 - 27:26)
money for Max particles and I was like (27:24 - 27:29)
totally fair I just want the other shiny (27:26 - 27:30)
I don&#39;t even know which one I have the (27:29 - 27:31)
blue one I think I was like I want the (27:30 - 27:34)
yellow shiny I was like all right you (27:31 - 27:37)
you can sit here and drink your 7-Eleven (27:34 - 27:38)
coffee I&#39;m going to run and do this (27:37 - 27:40)
toxcity so I&#39;m like on my way to the (27:38 - 27:43)
toxcity and I jump in there&#39;s like 36 (27:40 - 27:46)
people I&#39;m like 37 20 seconds left it (27:43 - 27:49)
fills up to 40 and somebody in like in (27:46 - 27:52)
my chat was like must be nice to have (27:49 - 27:55)
friends (27:52 - 27:58)
like it&#39;s like this bitterness of like (27:55 - 28:01)
I&#39;m sure you live in like a small town (27:58 - 28:03)
and you can&#39;t get 40 people like for (28:01 - 28:06)
sure what friends man I can&#39;t even speak (28:03 - 28:08)
the (28:06 - 28:08)
language yeah uh I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know (28:09 - 28:14)
where that like bitterness comes from of (28:12 - 28:15)
just (28:14 - 28:19)
like I get it that you can&#39;t do this (28:15 - 28:23)
feature that requires people I (28:19 - 28:25)
understand but (28:23 - 28:25)
like I I&#39;ve done a lot of gmax raids as (28:26 - 28:33)
I just said I&#39;ve talked to no one to do (28:29 - 28:35)
this I have coordinated with zero people (28:33 - 28:38)
I have either opened up campfire and (28:35 - 28:39)
went well looks like there&#39;s people (28:38 - 28:41)
going to be here at 2:00 and then I just (28:39 - 28:44)
show up and I am part of that mob that (28:41 - 28:48)
shows up uh or I just go huh this is a (28:44 - 28:51)
pretty busy area of the city people are (28:48 - 28:53)
doing this raid I will jump in and also (28:51 - 28:57)
do this raid um out of the 55 I did I (28:53 - 29:01)
think I maybe failed four or five (28:57 - 29:02)
like (29:01 - 29:05)
oh we we either didn&#39;t have enough (29:02 - 29:07)
people or something went wrong and then (29:05 - 29:08)
you just jump back in and you do it (29:07 - 29:11)
again so I do think there&#39;s um I said (29:08 - 29:14)
this a couple weeks ago uh I think it&#39;s (29:11 - 29:17)
as as we move on to Dynamax Lapras which (29:14 - 29:21)
is coming out soon gigantamax Lapras (29:17 - 29:24)
yeah gigantamax Lapras sorry uh that (29:21 - 29:26)
Niantic doesn&#39;t need to lower the (29:24 - 29:28)
difficulty because there&#39;s a certain (29:26 - 29:29)
thrat (29:28 - 29:32)
threshold the Tyranitar example I used (29:29 - 29:34)
you know when Tyranitar first came out (29:32 - 29:36)
it was like oh my gosh we need eight (29:34 - 29:38)
people to do Tyranitar we never going to (29:36 - 29:39)
be able to do this so hard and all of a (29:38 - 29:41)
sudden like Tyranitar is just trivial (29:39 - 29:42)
like I think we (29:41 - 29:45)
have I think that mountain has mostly (29:42 - 29:49)
been climbed (29:45 - 29:49)
where everything going forward should be (29:49 - 29:55)
a lot easier because people have at (29:52 - 29:58)
least a couple Pokemon that work in some (29:55 - 30:00)
sort of of combination because people (29:58 - 30:02)
have built up Pokemon to using these (30:00 - 30:04)
raids and actually understand how it (30:02 - 30:07)
works now yeah which was not the case I (30:04 - 30:09)
don&#39;t know if everyone understands how (30:07 - 30:12)
it works but enough (30:09 - 30:12)
people I am still the only one hitting (30:13 - 30:19)
Max strike and or sorry Max guard and (30:16 - 30:23)
Max Spirit yeah that&#39;ll come with time (30:19 - 30:28)
more time maybe maybe a lot more time (30:23 - 30:32)
but uh yeah oh the other thing I wanted (30:28 - 30:33)
to bring up before I think we move on (30:32 - 30:36)
from this event cuz I there&#39;s like a I (30:33 - 30:37)
don&#39;t know I I thought it was an okay (30:36 - 30:38)
event I think the spawns were the (30:37 - 30:42)
weakest part I think this event with the (30:38 - 30:46)
Safari balls um I think it&#39;s I don&#39;t (30:42 - 30:48)
want to say it&#39;s like hinting was my tin (30:46 - 30:51)
foil hat I think we are (30:48 - 30:55)
getting to a point where they&#39;re going (30:51 - 30:58)
to raise the level cap again from 50 to (30:55 - 31:01)
60 and I think this event is laying that (30:58 - 31:05)
this event is was the start of that (31:01 - 31:08)
Foundation if I I think the mighty (31:05 - 31:10)
Pokemon were great there was very (31:08 - 31:12)
there&#39;s something very satisfying about (31:10 - 31:15)
catching a Pokemon who&#39;s like level 48 (31:12 - 31:21)
and like 98% IVs with like the move that (31:15 - 31:23)
is the best move like for for alligator (31:21 - 31:26)
it&#39;s like hydr Cannon and being like Oh (31:23 - 31:30)
I only need to put in like 6 XL candy to (31:26 - 31:33)
top this off to 50 verse Oh I need (31:30 - 31:38)
248 XL candy to get this to level 50 so (31:33 - 31:40)
real quick question about that I had (31:38 - 31:43)
heard that the in-person event the (31:40 - 31:46)
mighty Pokemon could be up to level like (31:43 - 31:50)
45 or something but in the global event (31:46 - 31:53)
they weren&#39;t as high like I don&#39;t have (31:50 - 31:54)
any poke I&#39;m pretty sure I don&#39;t have (31:53 - 31:56)
any Pokemon from those Mighty ones that (31:54 - 31:59)
are over level 40 (31:56 - 32:03)
the yes the iners the global event was (31:59 - 32:05)
nerfed mighty Pokemon wise which like (32:03 - 32:07)
makes sense cuz they want they always (32:05 - 32:10)
want the like inperson people to like (32:07 - 32:11)
feel like they got their money&#39;s worth (32:10 - 32:13)
for yeah they got something that&#39;s extra (32:11 - 32:15)
that isn&#39;t like so much so that all the (32:13 - 32:17)
global people are angry about it but (32:15 - 32:21)
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah um I I (32:17 - 32:24)
definitely caught for the global event (32:21 - 32:27)
at level like 44 45 Pokémon oh really (32:24 - 32:28)
maybe it was (32:27 - 32:30)
maybe sorry maybe it was that the level (32:28 - 32:33)
maybe there was a difference in like I (32:30 - 32:34)
don&#39;t think you could get something (32:33 - 32:36)
above like 45 in the global event but (32:34 - 32:38)
you could in the iners event or (32:36 - 32:41)
something I got like four level 50s in (32:38 - 32:44)
person okay sorry so it was it was 40 to (32:41 - 32:46)
45 was Global but I think if you were in (32:44 - 32:48)
the in-person event you could catch (32:46 - 32:50)
things between 45 and 50 or something (32:48 - 32:51)
like and there was like a small issue (32:50 - 32:54)
where Snorlax could be like level 53 or (32:51 - 32:57)
54 and that&#39;s the leak that&#39;s the (32:54 - 32:58)
they&#39;re like oh no whoops we&#39;re not (32:57 - 33:00)
supposed to release that cuz there&#39;s not (32:58 - 33:02)
level 60 yet yeah (33:00 - 33:06)
yeah I I do think though like so next (33:02 - 33:08)
year will be the ninth anniversary of (33:06 - 33:10)
Pokémon go I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t think (33:08 - 33:11)
the level cap will happen then I think (33:10 - 33:13)
the level cap will happen for the 10th (33:11 - 33:15)
year I think that&#39;s a huge like 10year (33:13 - 33:18)
celebration so I do think all of next (33:15 - 33:23)
year Mighty Pokemon will be a gimic that (33:18 - 33:25)
will exist at Events maybe not like (33:23 - 33:27)
Unova tour which we still haven&#39;t talked (33:25 - 33:29)
about yet but (33:27 - 33:32)
um I think if you if you get players to (33:29 - 33:36)
catch more level 40 Pokemon and have (33:32 - 33:39)
that and then you can start introducing (33:36 - 33:42)
more endgame content where it&#39;s like (33:39 - 33:44)
they don&#39;t feel like they have to catch (33:42 - 33:48)
up right MH yeah uh like for Me Maybe (33:44 - 33:50)
not that impactful because I&#39;ve already (33:48 - 33:52)
had level 50 Pokemon as a level 50 (33:50 - 33:55)
player right but I would imagine if (33:52 - 33:57)
somebody just started playing this game (33:55 - 33:58)
two years ago (33:57 - 34:01)
and now they did that weekend and they (33:58 - 34:04)
have you know eight or nine level 40 (34:01 - 34:06)
Pokemon or (34:04 - 34:10)
402 that&#39;s a huge jump for them to be (34:06 - 34:12)
able to do raids easier those Tyranitar (34:10 - 34:13)
are not going to stand a chance when (34:12 - 34:16)
they come back (34:13 - 34:21)
like I think I think it was just a cool (34:16 - 34:22)
thing that they did that didn&#39;t like (34:21 - 34:25)
rely on well this event is just another (34:22 - 34:26)
shiny event and that&#39;s what I told (34:25 - 34:29)
people coming in when they came into (34:26 - 34:30)
like my Fukuoka streams and they were (34:29 - 34:32)
like is this event worth it should I buy (34:30 - 34:35)
the ticket next week and I was just like (34:32 - 34:39)
if you only care about Shiny Pokemon I (34:35 - 34:40)
don&#39;t think this event is worth it (34:39 - 34:41)
unless like you really like shiny (34:40 - 34:44)
Venipede I guess may like eat your heart (34:41 - 34:47)
out uh but like if you (34:44 - 34:50)
wanted if you wanted strong Pokemon if (34:47 - 34:52)
you wanted if you cared about like (34:50 - 34:54)
gigantamax stuff if you wanted just more (34:52 - 34:56)
Stardust more (34:54 - 34:59)
experience um if you just wanted to like (34:56 - 35:02)
grind everything that wasn&#39;t shiny I (34:59 - 35:03)
think the event was great and if people (35:02 - 35:05)
looked at it like that and that&#39;s what (35:03 - 35:07)
they wanted I I think they they would (35:05 - 35:09)
have probably enjoyed it but if you only (35:07 - 35:10)
cared about Shiny Pokemon you&#39;re like I (35:09 - 35:12)
don&#39;t I don&#39;t care about level 50 I (35:10 - 35:13)
don&#39;t care about level 40 I don&#39;t care (35:12 - 35:15)
about Stardust I never power up anything (35:13 - 35:18)
anyways I could I could 100% see why (35:15 - 35:20)
you&#39;d be like I didn&#39;t really like this (35:18 - 35:24)
event well I what I like about the event (35:20 - 35:27)
is that they didn&#39;t direct you toward (35:24 - 35:30)
things being like that the that (35:27 - 35:32)
everything was about it being shiny they (35:30 - 35:35)
gave us something new that made the (35:32 - 35:37)
event feel like oh I don&#39;t need to just (35:35 - 35:39)
go shiny hunt like there are other (35:37 - 35:41)
things that they made feel important (35:39 - 35:44)
they made the mighty Pokemon feel (35:41 - 35:46)
important so then it became oh I can (35:44 - 35:48)
hunt these Mighty Pokemon and get these (35:46 - 35:51)
really high level super high Pokemon (35:48 - 35:53)
that are raid ready that are just you (35:51 - 35:55)
know they made that feel important and (35:53 - 35:58)
that was a big part of like how they did (35:55 - 35:59)
did it because they could have just made (35:58 - 36:02)
this another oh go hunt a bunch of shiny (35:59 - 36:03)
Pokémon you know that&#39;s done so well for (36:02 - 36:05)
them over time but it was nice to see (36:03 - 36:06)
them (36:05 - 36:11)
change uh in a way like change the focus (36:06 - 36:13)
of the event so that that it wasn&#39;t so (36:11 - 36:14)
focused on that and maybe there&#39;s a part (36:13 - 36:16)
of like the fact that there wasn&#39;t the (36:14 - 36:19)
spawn diversity that led to that because (36:16 - 36:20)
because of that there was like well I (36:19 - 36:23)
can go get these Shiny Pokemon but it&#39;s (36:20 - 36:24)
like every hour I&#39;m seeing the same (36:23 - 36:26)
Pokemon but these Mighty Pokemon are (36:24 - 36:29)
more rare they&#39;re different stuff um (36:26 - 36:31)
these raid there&#39;s a lot of raids I mean (36:29 - 36:33)
this was a very raid heavy event in my (36:31 - 36:35)
opinion between the Dynamax gigantamax (36:33 - 36:37)
and just regular raids um Snorlax (36:35 - 36:39)
especially especially Global with (36:37 - 36:42)
Snorlax being in just in raids which I (36:39 - 36:44)
got a shiny one I was happy about that (36:42 - 36:48)
uh but yeah so it was definitely a more (36:44 - 36:51)
raid heavy event but I did appreciate (36:48 - 36:53)
that it wasn&#39;t as I say like I got a (36:51 - 36:56)
shiny one um it wasn&#39;t so focused on the (36:53 - 36:59)
shiny Pokemon as much as has uh other (36:56 - 37:01)
stuff which which is good and I feel (36:59 - 37:03)
like they they need to maybe lean into (37:01 - 37:07)
that going forward because Shiny Pokemon (37:03 - 37:08)
you&#39;re going to run out eventually like (37:07 - 37:11)
it you don&#39;t stay in that one Focus they (37:08 - 37:12)
still kind of leaning into shinies (37:11 - 37:14)
though because the mighty Pokemon could (37:12 - 37:16)
be shiny and people were excited about (37:14 - 37:18)
that they are they are but at but in (37:16 - 37:20)
past it&#39;s like that&#39;s almost been the (37:18 - 37:22)
only thing they&#39;ve like made focus on (37:20 - 37:24)
whereas this it was like there were (37:22 - 37:26)
other things where if I got a mighty (37:24 - 37:28)
Pokemon and it was shiny like even (37:26 - 37:29)
better but I wasn&#39;t expecting it and I (37:28 - 37:32)
was totally was just wanting to catch (37:29 - 37:33)
the mighty Pokemon more than anything (37:32 - 37:37)
else so I I appreciated that hope they (37:33 - 37:39)
lean into that (37:37 - 37:43)
more yeah no I I I liked it I I think (37:39 - 37:47)
um I was also playing with somebody that (37:43 - 37:48)
they didn&#39;t care about raids they didn&#39;t (37:47 - 37:50)
care about Chinese but they said their (37:48 - 37:53)
favorite part was activating (37:50 - 37:56)
Diga and just like waiting for one of (37:53 - 37:58)
the birds to appear (37:56 - 38:01)
um with the adventure incense because (37:58 - 38:03)
they were like I because the Safari Ball (38:01 - 38:06)
was so powerful they were like I just (38:03 - 38:08)
finally feel like I have a chance to (38:06 - 38:09)
catch the (38:08 - 38:12)
birds and that is exciting to me and (38:09 - 38:14)
that was like a really interesting thing (38:12 - 38:17)
to like hear of like like because I (38:14 - 38:19)
think the birds are so hard to catch (38:17 - 38:20)
people just get discouraged or they&#39;re (38:19 - 38:21)
like I&#39;m not even going to bother it&#39;s (38:20 - 38:24)
going to show up like and like also (38:21 - 38:25)
there&#39;s the thing of like I don&#39;t want (38:24 - 38:27)
to spend money for a master ball or like (38:25 - 38:28)
I only have two master ball so like (38:27 - 38:30)
what&#39;s the point because like when the (38:28 - 38:31)
third one shows up I won&#39;t have a master (38:30 - 38:36)
ball for it um but they they like (38:31 - 38:39)
literally both both days they just maxed (38:36 - 38:41)
out their rare candy to di alga they (38:39 - 38:42)
turned on their Adventure incense they (38:41 - 38:44)
let it go and they were just like I&#39;m (38:42 - 38:46)
doing bird watch all weekend and did (38:44 - 38:49)
they succeed they got I think (38:46 - 38:53)
two mol trace and two Articuno so they (38:49 - 38:55)
they they they didn&#39;t have Zapdos appear (38:53 - 38:58)
but but like still that&#39;s a lot like (38:55 - 39:00)
more excited I saw a person versus like (38:58 - 39:01)
getting a shiny they were just so (39:00 - 39:04)
excited when like oh my gosh the bird po (39:01 - 39:07)
popped up and they golden R Safari Ball (39:04 - 39:09)
caught it and I was like that was (39:07 - 39:13)
exciting to them yeah and and Niantic is (39:09 - 39:16)
in control of like that experience to an (39:13 - 39:18)
extent right they can make remember when (39:16 - 39:21)
everybody was love like mie was rare and (39:18 - 39:22)
everyone would wanted a mie and it was (39:21 - 39:24)
so hard to get a mie and then you go (39:22 - 39:26)
play the main series and it&#39;s like oh (39:24 - 39:28)
they&#39;re everywhere like n control that (39:26 - 39:29)
right they don&#39;t like you can make (39:28 - 39:31)
something it doesn&#39;t have to just be a (39:29 - 39:33)
shiny thing you can make other things (39:31 - 39:36)
the focus or you can make other things (39:33 - 39:38)
work in a way that gets people excited (39:36 - 39:40)
about it without it just being shiny and (39:38 - 39:43)
I I feel like time that does get tiring (39:40 - 39:45)
after a while like the drip feed of the (39:43 - 39:48)
Pokemon and I&#39;m thinking of the Dragons (39:45 - 39:51)
specifically like every year the Dragon (39:48 - 39:54)
type Pokemon the the Pokemon that (39:51 - 39:56)
everybody wants when they first come out (39:54 - 39:59)
but then it go Fest or some event they (39:56 - 40:01)
uh make them raid exclusive and you can (39:59 - 40:04)
get the shiny shiny that way but then (40:01 - 40:06)
the shiny is more available than next (40:04 - 40:07)
year because it&#39;s part of the event as a (40:06 - 40:09)
spawn (40:07 - 40:12)
and that&#39;s exciting at first and then (40:09 - 40:14)
you learn that it&#39;s raid exclusive and (40:12 - 40:16)
it&#39;ll just be more available later but (40:14 - 40:18)
it&#39;s the but again that&#39;s that&#39;s going (40:16 - 40:20)
back into the the thing that people are (40:18 - 40:22)
going after for that is the shiny I&#39;m so (40:20 - 40:23)
what I&#39;m saying is like do these things (40:22 - 40:25)
that move away from that right and like (40:23 - 40:27)
the gallerian birds are an example of (40:25 - 40:29)
that I mean definitely people were (40:27 - 40:31)
frustrated because you couldn&#39;t get the (40:29 - 40:33)
garan birds to show up I was one of them (40:31 - 40:36)
for like two months before I caught a (40:33 - 40:38)
Zapdos like using the daily Adventure (40:36 - 40:42)
incense every day but uh I just I&#39;m just (40:38 - 40:43)
saying like there are other ways to get (40:42 - 40:46)
people excited about these things that (40:43 - 40:48)
don&#39;t have to be shiny related and I (40:46 - 40:51)
want I don&#39;t disagree I&#39;m just saying (40:48 - 40:53)
that they&#39;re all going to get to be more (40:51 - 40:55)
mundane over time and then they yeah and (40:53 - 40:57)
then niantic&#39;s job is to figure out how (40:55 - 40:58)
to (40:57 - 41:00)
change it up and focus on something new (40:58 - 41:03)
or add a new ball or whatever they have (41:00 - 41:05)
to do but like just make it so that it&#39;s (41:03 - 41:08)
not shiny stuff that everybody is like (41:05 - 41:10)
going after all the time we did that for (41:08 - 41:12)
eight years right like move on to (41:10 - 41:13)
something I mean they are actively (41:12 - 41:15)
trying we have extra small we have extra (41:13 - 41:18)
large we have gigantamax we have Dynamax (41:15 - 41:22)
it&#39;s true we I&#39;m sure Z moves in (41:18 - 41:24)
terization they can do all the hats they (41:22 - 41:27)
want eventually when they get to that um (41:24 - 41:30)
we need Z moves we need Z moves alola (41:27 - 41:32)
forever yeah you have to move your phone (41:30 - 41:34)
in the (41:32 - 41:36)
right all right uh let&#39;s take a quick (41:34 - 41:38)
break and then when we come back uh (41:36 - 41:40)
we&#39;ll we&#39;ll run through what you can (41:38 - 41:43)
expect at Unova tour um and then we&#39;ll (41:40 - 41:45)
do the our pocket stuff and then our (41:43 - 41:48)
scarlet and violet stuff we&#39;ll be right (41:45 - 41:52)
back and we are back from our our break (41:48 - 41:56)
uh Pokémon go tour Unova in Los Angeles (41:52 - 41:58)
which is actually Pasadena not (41:56 - 42:01)
technically La (41:58 - 42:05)
true uh and then uh new Taipei (42:01 - 42:09)
City is the other experience uh it&#39;s (42:05 - 42:11)
going to be in the Rose Bowl again (42:09 - 42:13)
February 21st through 23rd which I think (42:11 - 42:14)
is different than last year if I (42:13 - 42:16)
remember last year it was only Saturday (42:14 - 42:18)
and Sunday and then Friday was like an (42:16 - 42:20)
optional City experience you could like (42:18 - 42:24)
buy this is Friday Saturday and Sunday (42:20 - 42:26)
and then the extra cities would just be (42:24 - 42:30)
the one day you don&#39;t play um and unless (42:26 - 42:36)
I&#39;m wrong uh it&#39;s all day in the Park (42:30 - 42:39)
versus Fukuoka which is and a lot of (42:36 - 42:42)
like go Fest which was four hours in the (42:39 - 42:44)
park and then 4 (42:42 - 42:46)
hours outside of the park and then you (42:44 - 42:48)
could add on the city experience so this (42:46 - 42:51)
is three days but your day is all day in (42:48 - 42:54)
the park and you can buy the city (42:51 - 42:56)
experience for the other two days if you (42:54 - 42:59)
want so you can can buy it for it is (42:56 - 43:02)
extra per day but you can buy it for uh (42:59 - 43:04)
the other two days that you&#39;re not in (43:02 - 43:09)
the park as well yeah um so I I will say (43:04 - 43:12)
I will I will die on this hill if you (43:09 - 43:17)
can go to the non weekend event AKA (43:12 - 43:21)
Friday that will be the better day it (43:17 - 43:23)
will be less busy it will be easier to (43:21 - 43:26)
get in and out of traffic there will be (43:23 - 43:28)
less people if you don&#39;t don&#39;t want if (43:26 - 43:31)
if that if that&#39;s what you prefer you (43:28 - 43:32)
might like less people cuz that means (43:31 - 43:34)
less people waiting for food which means (43:32 - 43:35)
you get your food faster which means you (43:34 - 43:37)
can play Pokemon more um if there are (43:35 - 43:41)
any issues you do get it but Niantic has (43:37 - 43:44)
always been very good at extending your (43:41 - 43:49)
gameplay yeah um so I do think if you (43:44 - 43:52)
are going to travel for the (43:49 - 43:55)
weekend if you have any ability to add (43:52 - 43:59)
an extra day so you could play on Friday (43:55 - 44:01)
I think that is the the day you pick I (43:59 - 44:03)
think as of recording this Saturday (44:01 - 44:05)
pre-sales are already sold out anyways (44:03 - 44:08)
Saturday is the busiest day um it always (44:05 - 44:13)
is so and of course like it&#39;s definitely (44:08 - 44:16)
weather specific so hopefully it doesn&#39;t (44:13 - 44:19)
rain it&#39;ll probably be okay but yeah (44:16 - 44:21)
yeah you never know I think last year it (44:19 - 44:26)
rained on Monday the which was like my (44:21 - 44:28)
like extra day to just like hang out in (44:26 - 44:30)
California and I was like oh of course (44:28 - 44:32)
the one weekend I&#39;m here it&#39;s actually (44:30 - 44:33)
like (44:32 - 44:37)
raining um I will say the city Safari or (44:33 - 44:40)
city Safari the Citywide experience the (44:37 - 44:43)
wild uh yeah when you uh when you (44:40 - 44:45)
purchase those for the days that you&#39;re (44:43 - 44:48)
not in the uh in the event it does say (44:45 - 44:51)
that it covers Lo anywhere in Los (44:48 - 44:54)
Angeles or Orange County if you&#39;re not (44:51 - 44:57)
from Southern California that is a large (44:54 - 44:58)
area (44:57 - 45:00)
that is it is not just a city that is a (44:58 - 45:03)
large area of so if you&#39;re in or if (45:00 - 45:06)
you&#39;re not even staying in Los Angeles (45:03 - 45:08)
if you&#39;re more toward South toward like (45:06 - 45:10)
Orange County and you can still do all (45:08 - 45:12)
the spawns and things like that you (45:10 - 45:13)
don&#39;t have to be in Los Angeles on the (45:12 - 45:15)
days that you&#39;re not in the park um from (45:13 - 45:18)
what it says on the information so just (45:15 - 45:21)
a note like it does say City experience (45:18 - 45:24)
extends to Orange County um which is (45:21 - 45:26)
like further south than Los Angeles so (45:24 - 45:28)
if you happen to you know be staying (45:26 - 45:30)
somewhere for that weekend and South you (45:28 - 45:33)
can do that like technically Anaheim is (45:30 - 45:36)
not Los Angeles but it worked in Anaheim (45:33 - 45:38)
Anaheim is Orange County oh okay okay (45:36 - 45:42)
okay okay yeah so we did last year we (45:38 - 45:46)
had like a it&#39;s like an ISC Meetup in (45:42 - 45:49)
Anaheim but you were playing you played (45:46 - 45:51)
in at the Rose bow in Pasadena so two (45:49 - 45:52)
different places but in Anaheim was (45:51 - 45:54)
where we met up where Disney it&#39;s where (45:52 - 45:57)
Disneyland is it&#39;s that area and you can (45:54 - 46:00)
get all the city experience stuff there (45:57 - 46:02)
as well because that is in Orange County (46:00 - 46:05)
so just as a make that as a note if (46:02 - 46:06)
you&#39;re going to be around I think I (46:05 - 46:08)
think you can even like in Disneyland (46:06 - 46:09)
you should be able to get the spawns (46:08 - 46:11)
then so if you made a weekend out of it (46:09 - 46:13)
and you wanted to go to Disneyland today (46:11 - 46:14)
you should be able to get the spawns for (46:13 - 46:16)
the city-wide experience because that is (46:14 - 46:18)
part of Orange (46:16 - 46:21)
County uh I will say like as somebody (46:18 - 46:25)
who&#39;s been to a lot of go (46:21 - 46:28)
events uh I think the rose is a pretty (46:25 - 46:32)
okay place to play honestly as like one (46:28 - 46:36)
it&#39;s it makes Rand (46:32 - 46:38)
it rand&#39;s island is a dump compared to (46:36 - 46:40)
the Rose (46:38 - 46:45)
B yeah the the I do like the concept of (46:40 - 46:50)
playing near a stadium um so like if you (46:45 - 46:51)
didn&#39;t go last year for (46:50 - 46:54)
cotour uh you enter where the stadium is (46:51 - 46:57)
where the roseb stadium is and then the (46:54 - 46:59)
golf course next to it was also the (46:57 - 47:03)
majority play area um so the actual (46:59 - 47:05)
center of the Rose bow was like mostly (47:03 - 47:09)
like photo ops and um like Community (47:05 - 47:12)
meetups and stuff for like pictures but (47:09 - 47:15)
all around the Rose Bowl uh you could (47:12 - 47:17)
you could just do a circle and like (47:15 - 47:19)
catch stuff cuz the Rose Bowl was its (47:17 - 47:21)
own biome and then the golf course was (47:19 - 47:24)
like three other biomes but the cool (47:21 - 47:25)
thing is because the Rose Bowl is a (47:24 - 47:28)
stadium it has all of those bathrooms (47:25 - 47:31)
built in which is like much better than (47:28 - 47:33)
the portapotty situation that you would (47:31 - 47:37)
get at like Las Vegas or Randall&#39;s (47:33 - 47:40)
Island um and then also because it is a (47:37 - 47:42)
stadium all all of those like food (47:40 - 47:44)
places not all of them but the majority (47:42 - 47:46)
of them open so you have all the food (47:44 - 47:48)
trucks but then you also have the (47:46 - 47:51)
stadium food that is opened and then on (47:48 - 47:52)
top of that which you don&#39;t even think (47:51 - 47:55)
about until like you play until I played (47:52 - 47:57)
here last year is because it&#39;s a state (47:55 - 48:00)
Stadium they just have like 80,000 seats (47:57 - 48:03)
which is like amazing at an event where (48:00 - 48:05)
you&#39;re walking to be like I can actually (48:03 - 48:08)
find a place to sit down and I just (48:05 - 48:11)
bought this $30 hot dog and I can sit (48:08 - 48:14)
down and eat it and not have to worry (48:11 - 48:15)
about (48:14 - 48:17)
like finding somewhere to eat this hot (48:15 - 48:19)
dog like it&#39;s just really nice to be (48:17 - 48:22)
like I can sit down yeah and on top of (48:19 - 48:24)
that I imagine the cell service was (48:22 - 48:26)
probably pretty good because being an (48:24 - 48:29)
880,000 person stadium that has that (48:26 - 48:31)
many people at it every weekend they (48:29 - 48:34)
have in the recent years made the cell (48:31 - 48:36)
service better in these stadiums for (48:34 - 48:38)
those people so it&#39;s not like they&#39;ve (48:36 - 48:40)
not dealt with a large amount of people (48:38 - 48:43)
trying to use their phones at the same (48:40 - 48:45)
time yeah I don&#39;t remember any cell (48:43 - 48:48)
phone issues yeah that would make sense (48:45 - 48:50)
in a place like the rose bow yeah yeah (48:48 - 48:52)
yeah um this makes a lot of sense (48:50 - 48:54)
because giant (48:52 - 48:56)
Parks don&#39;t have the same sort of (48:54 - 48:57)
experience that (48:56 - 48:58)
people aren&#39;t going to be looking for (48:57 - 49:00)
food all the time people aren&#39;t going to (48:58 - 49:01)
be looking to sit down all the time but (49:00 - 49:03)
in a stadium you have all of this ready (49:01 - 49:06)
to go yeah it&#39;s really great I will say (49:03 - 49:08)
at at fukoka I didn&#39;t really talk about (49:06 - 49:10)
the in-person experience but when I when (49:08 - 49:12)
I got I don&#39;t know why I go to these (49:10 - 49:15)
events early CU there&#39;s always like a (49:12 - 49:18)
tech issue so when I got there like I&#39;m (49:15 - 49:20)
the person telling everyone to go to (49:18 - 49:22)
this new event on the first day yeah (49:20 - 49:25)
yeah yeah yeah yeah (49:22 - 49:28)
yeah it&#39;s only like the first 15 minutes (49:25 - 49:29)
and then it gets (49:28 - 49:32)
fixed so I I get there to Fukuoka and (49:29 - 49:35)
like my entire stream there cuz I&#39;m like (49:32 - 49:37)
streaming myself because it&#39;s it&#39;s like (49:35 - 49:39)
a 15minute walk from the nearest train (49:37 - 49:42)
station cuz it&#39;s in a park um (49:39 - 49:43)
everything&#39;s working fine and then as (49:42 - 49:45)
soon as we get into the the park which (49:43 - 49:46)
is there&#39;s no it&#39;s not a fenced Park (49:45 - 49:48)
like the rose bow so anyone could walk (49:46 - 49:50)
in but we get into the park and all of a (49:48 - 49:52)
sudden like I don&#39;t have like I don&#39;t (49:50 - 49:54)
have service I can&#39;t connect on my phone (49:52 - 49:56)
and like the people I&#39;m with they also (49:54 - 49:57)
can&#39;t connect with their phone my (49:56 - 50:00)
Japanese friend Julie who lives in Japan (49:57 - 50:02)
has doesn&#39;t have eims has like Japanese (50:00 - 50:05)
Sims she can&#39;t connect uh but you know (50:02 - 50:06)
I&#39;m I&#39;m surrounded by people that are (50:05 - 50:09)
playing so it&#39;s like well is it me am I (50:06 - 50:10)
the Foreigner with just like bad sim (50:09 - 50:13)
cards I can&#39;t connect and like of course (50:10 - 50:15)
for like the first 15 minutes like I (50:13 - 50:19)
can&#39;t play and I just like I was like (50:15 - 50:20)
I&#39;ll just walk to the other end of the (50:19 - 50:22)
park CU there&#39;s raids over there I want (50:20 - 50:23)
to do anyways and as soon as I leave (50:22 - 50:26)
that like intro area everything&#39;s (50:23 - 50:27)
working great (50:26 - 50:30)
um and then uh they had a bunch of food (50:27 - 50:33)
trucks in Fukuoka and I went over there (50:30 - 50:35)
and not only did my phone stop working (50:33 - 50:37)
but like my stream backpack which has (50:35 - 50:40)
multiple SIM cards like that went down (50:37 - 50:42)
and I was like what is h like it&#39;s it&#39;s (50:40 - 50:44)
been like three hours into the event (50:42 - 50:46)
what what is happening I end up talking (50:44 - 50:48)
to Niantic cuz they&#39;re (50:46 - 50:50)
like how&#39;s the event are you guys having (50:48 - 50:53)
fun I like I was like yeah the first 15 (50:50 - 50:55)
minutes was kind of rough and they were (50:53 - 50:58)
like yeah we know which is like it&#39;s (50:55 - 51:00)
validating to hear right like yeah (50:58 - 51:02)
totally it is like okay it&#39;s just not me (51:00 - 51:05)
and they were like be everyone got into (51:02 - 51:07)
the park and stopped and they all (51:05 - 51:09)
connected to the same Tower and that (51:07 - 51:12)
Tower got overwhelmed and once we told (51:09 - 51:14)
people to like just spread out a little (51:12 - 51:16)
bit it worked and that&#39;s true like after (51:14 - 51:19)
the first 15 minutes the park was fine (51:16 - 51:20)
and I was like yeah you guys have a I (51:19 - 51:22)
was like yeah you guys have another dead (51:20 - 51:24)
spot over at the food trucks and they (51:22 - 51:27)
were like no well they were like yes (51:24 - 51:29)
were like we purposely put a dead spot (51:27 - 51:31)
in the food trucks because in past (51:29 - 51:35)
events people would just play where the (51:31 - 51:37)
food was and then it would confuse (51:35 - 51:39)
people cuz they thought they were in (51:37 - 51:43)
line oh okay and I was (51:39 - 51:45)
like that&#39;s smart that&#39;s super smart you (51:43 - 51:48)
know what&#39;s smarter Niantic put a sign (51:45 - 51:51)
yeah communicate that because I&#39;m (51:48 - 51:52)
sitting there in front of the food truck (51:51 - 51:54)
trying to fix my (51:52 - 51:57)
backpack and all I had to do was like (51:54 - 51:59)
walk like 20 ft outside of the Food (51:57 - 52:01)
Truck Zone and like everything started (51:59 - 52:05)
working instantly again yeah so uh pros (52:01 - 52:08)
and cons pros and cons but (52:05 - 52:10)
like I don&#39;t know how you you don&#39;t (52:08 - 52:12)
really like I think the way you fix the (52:10 - 52:14)
issue of like everyone connecting to the (52:12 - 52:16)
same Tower is like you don&#39;t have one (52:14 - 52:19)
entrance which (52:16 - 52:22)
fuk yeah Fukuoka had like the main (52:19 - 52:24)
entrance cuz it was like this is where (52:22 - 52:25)
the train just drops off everyone&#39;s (52:24 - 52:27)
taking the train we&#39;re all just entering (52:25 - 52:29)
this way like there&#39;s no back train (52:27 - 52:30)
entrance I don&#39;t know why you would get (52:29 - 52:32)
to the park and be like I&#39;m just going (52:30 - 52:33)
to walk around like no you&#39;re just going (52:32 - 52:37)
to walk through the park um Rose Ball (52:33 - 52:39)
was supposed to last year have two (52:37 - 52:42)
entrances and it&#39;s a stadium stadiums by (52:39 - 52:45)
default have multiple entrances just a (52:42 - 52:48)
few yeah Niantic whatever messed up last (52:45 - 52:50)
year or I don&#39;t know maybe it was it&#39;s a (52:48 - 52:52)
very easy to blame Nan tickets they it (52:50 - 52:54)
didn&#39;t open a door what like yeah I (52:52 - 52:56)
there was something wrong with security (52:54 - 52:57)
last year where they had everyone go (52:56 - 53:01)
through one entrance and the and the on (52:57 - 53:03)
Sunday they fixed it where they opened (53:01 - 53:05)
up like three of the it&#39;s again a (53:03 - 53:07)
stadium they have multiple Gates like (53:05 - 53:11)
gate a 47 entrances so like on on Sunday (53:07 - 53:14)
they they had multiple gates open so (53:11 - 53:16)
there wasn&#39;t that like a wait they&#39;re (53:14 - 53:17)
saying here on the website there will be (53:16 - 53:20)
four entrances last year they said two (53:17 - 53:22)
I&#39;m just saying on Saturday they only (53:20 - 53:24)
had one opened Sunday they they fixed (53:22 - 53:27)
that so the nice thing (53:24 - 53:29)
about in my opinion the nice thing about (53:27 - 53:32)
Niantic going back to a repeat location (53:29 - 53:35)
is they&#39;ve been there before so they can (53:32 - 53:36)
be like this is what worked this is what (53:35 - 53:40)
didn&#39;t work so um I still think it&#39;s (53:36 - 53:42)
going to be Randall&#39;s Island next year (53:40 - 53:44)
for go Fest yeah I think I think they (53:42 - 53:46)
signed a three-year deal I would be (53:44 - 53:48)
surprised if they signed a multi-year (53:46 - 53:51)
deal here with the Rose Bowl I think (53:48 - 53:52)
that&#39;s only a good thing because those (53:51 - 53:54)
events get better like Chicago got (53:52 - 53:55)
better and better every time they did (53:54 - 53:59)
Chicago did New York get better between (53:55 - 54:01)
year one and year two can they there (53:59 - 54:04)
wasn&#39;t a Verizon issue this (54:01 - 54:06)
year can they make Randall&#39;s Island (54:04 - 54:08)
better I&#39;m not sure how much they can I (54:06 - 54:11)
think that&#39;s mostly at the city of New (54:08 - 54:14)
York just left all the cranes in (54:11 - 54:18)
construction from last year (54:14 - 54:18)
yeah uh if you are deciding to go to (54:18 - 54:24)
Unova (54:23 - 54:27)
tour um well Saturday currently is sold (54:24 - 54:29)
out I don&#39;t know if they will restock (54:27 - 54:30)
tickets because they did say that these (54:29 - 54:32)
are early birds so I don&#39;t know if (54:30 - 54:33)
they&#39;re specifically saying only early (54:32 - 54:36)
bird Saturday is sold out they did say (54:33 - 54:38)
they did do this last year and they did (54:36 - 54:40)
restock tickets not saying they will (54:38 - 54:43)
this year but they did have another wave (54:40 - 54:45)
of tickets CU I remember that I remember (54:43 - 54:46)
the early bird ones running out real (54:45 - 54:49)
quick and then there was another wave a (54:46 - 54:51)
couple months later that lasted like a (54:49 - 54:54)
weekend as well and there was a second (54:51 - 54:57)
wave so not saying it&#39;ll happen but like (54:54 - 55:01)
just be aware that this did happen last (54:57 - 55:04)
year yes so if if you were determined to (55:01 - 55:06)
go on (55:04 - 55:09)
Saturday now you&#39;re on ticket watch to (55:06 - 55:12)
see when they (55:09 - 55:12)
restock if they do restock which like (55:13 - 55:17)
Bobby said they did technically restock (55:16 - 55:21)
last year um here&#39;s what you&#39;re (55:17 - 55:23)
expecting at the event uh shiny (55:21 - 55:25)
moweta is going to be the Pokemon no (55:23 - 55:28)
Victini no Kelly (55:25 - 55:28)
Leo I I don&#39;t know what Pokemon I don&#39;t (55:29 - 55:34)
know what Mr muda&#39;s obsession with (55:32 - 55:36)
Victini is but that Pokemon will be (55:34 - 55:39)
shiny locked forever so is Keo also (55:36 - 55:41)
shiny locked yeah yeah it&#39;s never had a (55:39 - 55:46)
shiny either yeah um deerling will make (55:41 - 55:47)
it shiny debut and because they&#39;re doing (55:46 - 55:49)
four different biomes they&#39;re featuring (55:47 - 55:51)
each deerling in each of the biomes (55:49 - 55:54)
which I think is like pretty cool uh for (55:51 - 55:57)
for dearling Hannah agrees yeah (55:54 - 56:00)
yes I made a face I&#39;m very excited about (55:57 - 56:03)
that deing is such a good Pokemon it is (56:00 - 56:04)
yeah yeah dearing&#39;s really cool they&#39;re (56:03 - 56:07)
putting (56:04 - 56:10)
sigova cilith maractus and balant into (56:07 - 56:14)
eggs 10K eggs this is what they did for (56:10 - 56:16)
chattot and carnivine and tropus and (56:14 - 56:20)
thorl that&#39;s like not surprising (56:16 - 56:24)
although I&#39;m sure people are sigth is (56:20 - 56:27)
Egypt Regional right so yeah and and (56:24 - 56:29)
maybe a couple other places but it&#39;s got (56:27 - 56:31)
to be one of the it&#39;s been at a couple (56:29 - 56:34)
events it was in Sendai as the featured (56:31 - 56:36)
Pokemon okay because I remember I&#39;m out (56:34 - 56:38)
of I&#39;m out of sigil but people still ask (56:36 - 56:41)
for sigil like sigth (56:38 - 56:44)
Hawlucha um and K are pretty up there (56:41 - 56:48)
for what people are asking for yeah been (56:44 - 56:50)
events no hawlucha&#39;s (56:48 - 56:54)
only well it&#39;s in San Diego uh as well (56:50 - 56:57)
yeah Hawlucha is still like that was (56:54 - 56:59)
probably the most asked Pokemon I was (56:57 - 57:01)
asked as a foreigner in Japan was (56:59 - 57:04)
Hawlucha Sig was also available at New (57:01 - 57:08)
York go Fest in 2023 so I have a ton of (57:04 - 57:12)
them wait what was sorry I miss sigil (57:08 - 57:14)
okay five star raids right now they&#39;re (57:12 - 57:17)
saying rusham and (57:14 - 57:20)
Zeo come on come (57:17 - 57:24)
on black kierum and white kierum are (57:20 - 57:25)
definitely making their debut at this (57:24 - 57:29)
event there&#39;s no way they are not making (57:25 - 57:33)
their debut making their they debuted (57:29 - 57:36)
them once before they did debut for like (57:33 - 57:38)
two hours I don&#39;t know if that I don&#39;t (57:36 - 57:40)
know if that counts as a (57:38 - 57:43)
[Laughter] (57:40 - 57:46)
debut um we&#39;ll see what Adventure (57:43 - 57:49)
effects they&#39;ll probably have yeah there (57:46 - 57:50)
like very confident they&#39;ll have (57:49 - 57:52)
Adventure effects don&#39;t know how good (57:50 - 57:55)
they would be like one has to be like (57:52 - 57:58)
freezing something like freezing time or (57:55 - 58:01)
or something of sort yeah we already (57:58 - 58:04)
that but like I you know I think what&#39;s (58:01 - 58:07)
interesting at least for me when neosa (58:04 - 58:10)
had its Adventure effects based on (58:07 - 58:15)
lunala or Soo fuse I at first I didn&#39;t (58:10 - 58:17)
realize how good the adventure effect (58:15 - 58:19)
was like there you know like there are (58:17 - 58:20)
multiple parts to it so I hope it kind (58:19 - 58:23)
of is a similar thing where there are (58:20 - 58:25)
you know multiple pieces to it cuz with (58:23 - 58:27)
the with those it&#39;s like there&#39;s kind of (58:25 - 58:29)
two pieces to their Adventure effects (58:27 - 58:30)
right whereas like palia and DGA it&#39;s (58:29 - 58:33)
like very there&#39;s one thing right like (58:30 - 58:35)
stopping time or expanding expanding (58:33 - 58:38)
your area of reach with the solo and (58:35 - 58:41)
lunala ones it&#39;s like being able to do (58:38 - 58:43)
these things that are night but also (58:41 - 58:45)
this like 10-minute incense that spawns (58:43 - 58:47)
a Pokemon every minute that is like a (58:45 - 58:49)
specific kind right there&#39;s like two (58:47 - 58:50)
different parts to that which I thought (58:49 - 58:53)
was cool so it&#39;ll be fun to see I just (58:50 - 58:57)
don&#39;t think those two are as good as the (58:53 - 59:01)
Pia I agree agreed but if (58:57 - 59:04)
you&#39;re the incense is really cool (59:01 - 59:05)
especially because you get it one per (59:04 - 59:09)
minute without moving on the on the solo (59:05 - 59:12)
and lunala thing um which you know with (59:09 - 59:14)
the Palo one obviously it it makes more (59:12 - 59:16)
sense to be moving um dagga kind of the (59:14 - 59:20)
same but dagga I feel like is useless if (59:16 - 59:22)
you&#39;re not moving yeah well you could (59:20 - 59:24)
have an incense and then freeze it for (59:22 - 59:27)
it for other things get a spa every (59:24 - 59:29)
for day I feel like if you&#39;re not having (59:27 - 59:32)
incense star piece and lucky egg then (59:29 - 59:34)
you shouldn&#39;t be turning on Diaga you (59:32 - 59:37)
need to maximize that return actually to (59:34 - 59:40)
your point that I did a lot I did way (59:37 - 59:41)
too many raids this weekend so I&#39;m back (59:40 - 59:44)
in the raid game um but I would have (59:41 - 59:46)
been I should have been using Diaga with (59:44 - 59:48)
lucky egg on those raids and I could (59:46 - 59:51)
have just been doing all those raids and (59:48 - 59:54)
having the lucky eggs stay mhm yeah (59:51 - 59:57)
thanks for letting me know this St (59:54 - 59:59)
Sunday I&#39;m trying I&#39;m trying to think of (59:57 - 60:00)
like an (59:59 - 60:02)
adventure like I&#39;m trying to think of an (60:00 - 60:04)
adventure effect that would (60:02 - 60:09)
be not just an incense like M when when (60:04 - 60:11)
I think about Dawn wings necrozma and (60:09 - 60:14)
DUS M ncrma I feel like no one talks (60:11 - 60:15)
about their Adventure effects I think (60:14 - 60:17)
you Bobby are the only person in the (60:15 - 60:19)
world that has talked more than five (60:17 - 60:20)
minutes about their Adventure effects (60:19 - 60:22)
they&#39;re (60:20 - 60:25)
good they&#39;re for good (60:22 - 60:27)
[Laughter] (60:25 - 60:30)
they do exist but like even if an (60:27 - 60:32)
adventure effect was (60:30 - 60:36)
like you you can hatch eggs 20% faster (60:32 - 60:38)
or like 10% faster or something and that (60:36 - 60:40)
would like get you to walk like that (60:38 - 60:41)
would be really cool um I don&#39;t think (60:40 - 60:44)
that like fits a (60:41 - 60:49)
kierum in any way like I maybe the maybe (60:44 - 60:52)
fire one yeah kind of like a flame (60:49 - 60:57)
body yeah um true but I would like like (60:52 - 60:59)
I&#39;m not creative enough to think of (60:57 - 61:02)
Adventure effects but I would I really (60:59 - 61:05)
would love to see if they have very (61:02 - 61:07)
unique Adventure effects that just isn&#39;t (61:05 - 61:09)
like spawn more ice Pokemon for 10 (61:07 - 61:11)
minutes cuz that would be like the bare (61:09 - 61:15)
minimum I think yeah yeah I I will say (61:11 - 61:18)
with the going back to the solo and (61:15 - 61:19)
lunala ones (61:18 - 61:23)
um uh I do wish they changed up the pool (61:19 - 61:26)
of what spawns on that incense because (61:23 - 61:28)
you know each one it&#39;s like six or seven (61:26 - 61:30)
different Pokemon uh and if you&#39;re chiny (61:28 - 61:33)
hunting that&#39;s actually great there&#39;s (61:30 - 61:35)
like one of them is rockruff W you know (61:33 - 61:36)
which is a great Pokemon to shiny hunt (61:35 - 61:38)
especially on an incense that doesn&#39;t (61:36 - 61:40)
cost you anything sorry doesn&#39;t cost you (61:38 - 61:42)
any money cost you you know like (61:40 - 61:47)
Stardust and C your C time and time but (61:42 - 61:51)
but yeah I know a lot of people talked (61:47 - 61:53)
about maybe an adventure Effect one day (61:51 - 61:56)
that extends like being able to reach a (61:53 - 61:58)
poké stop I don&#39;t know if that would (61:56 - 62:01)
bring back too many bad feelings about (61:58 - 62:04)
2020 2021 time frame but that&#39;s one that (62:01 - 62:07)
has been people have said would be (62:04 - 62:08)
really cool but yeah to your point I (62:07 - 62:12)
mean St I the egg distance thing kind of (62:08 - 62:14)
or like the quicker egg hatching kind of (62:12 - 62:16)
seems like something that would be cool (62:14 - 62:18)
as well uh and it does that&#39;s another (62:16 - 62:19)
thing that gets you out and about which (62:18 - 62:22)
is what they want us to do that is (62:19 - 62:23)
definitely what they want I could see (62:22 - 62:25)
something like that yeah it&#39;s also like (62:23 - 62:27)
it&#39;s not as pris here (62:25 - 62:29)
Niantic they did this for wild area they (62:27 - 62:31)
did this for c tour they did this for (62:29 - 62:34)
yova or hoen tour they&#39;ve done this for (62:31 - 62:36)
go Fest where they here&#39;s there&#39;s like (62:34 - 62:40)
here&#39;s half the information MH and it&#39;s (62:36 - 62:41)
fine like I (62:40 - 62:44)
don&#39;t like I don&#39;t I I think they got to (62:41 - 62:47)
save some surprises yeah yeah so it&#39;s (62:44 - 62:49)
fine like there&#39;s no kierum (62:47 - 62:52)
here black Kum and white Kum have to be (62:49 - 62:54)
coming um so they&#39;re just saying for (62:52 - 62:56)
five star RS right now r r and z this is (62:54 - 62:58)
what they did again for c tour it was (62:56 - 63:01)
just Diga and Pia and then obviously (62:58 - 63:04)
origin form Diga Pia came um three star (63:01 - 63:08)
raids dran onear raids Snivy Tepig aswat (63:04 - 63:09)
that&#39;s what they&#39;re saying on the (63:08 - 63:12)
website sometimes this stuff changes um (63:09 - 63:14)
like I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if they add (63:12 - 63:15)
Pikachu to the one star (63:14 - 63:17)
raids uh but they there are four (63:15 - 63:19)
Pikachus they&#39;re doing black two and (63:17 - 63:24)
white two so Nate Rosa Hilbert Hilda (63:19 - 63:26)
those are your protagonists in those (63:24 - 63:28)
games uh really knocked out of the park (63:26 - 63:31)
with the naming there um they got a (63:28 - 63:32)
winter biome a spring biome a summer (63:31 - 63:35)
biome an Autumn (63:32 - 63:37)
biome it&#39;s Gen 5 pokemon I don&#39;t know (63:35 - 63:40)
what what you expect it to be somebody (63:37 - 63:42)
was like how do you feel about Unova (63:40 - 63:46)
tour it&#39;s just gen five Pokemon it&#39;s (63:42 - 63:48)
like there&#39;s a lot of gen five Pokemon (63:46 - 63:50)
which is nice there&#39;s 156 I don&#39;t think (63:48 - 63:52)
all 156 are going to be there like I (63:50 - 63:53)
don&#39;t (63:52 - 63:56)
think I would like Genesect I bet (63:53 - 63:59)
they&#39;re going to do what they did for um (63:56 - 64:01)
c tour I think I&#39;m just guessing where (63:59 - 64:03)
Genesect will be like in raids before or (64:01 - 64:04)
after the (64:03 - 64:07)
event uh it&#39;s in raids next like two (64:04 - 64:08)
days from now it is yeah I know it&#39;s in (64:07 - 64:11)
raids but I I would expect they were (64:08 - 64:13)
bring back Genesect I think that&#39;s fine (64:11 - 64:16)
like if they&#39;re releasing black and (64:13 - 64:18)
white kierum I would rather focus on (64:16 - 64:21)
that than JCT there is no sign here of (64:18 - 64:23)
Tren calian (64:21 - 64:26)
verian I suspect that this will be the (64:23 - 64:30)
Mesprit as elf ukie of the event where (64:26 - 64:32)
they will appear in the (64:30 - 64:35)
wild you take a snapshot you&#39;ll get to (64:32 - 64:38)
catch it if it&#39;s shiny you&#39;ll see it and (64:35 - 64:39)
it won&#39;t run away that kind of thing not (64:38 - 64:41)
nearly as good as the L spirits but (64:39 - 64:42)
that&#39;s my (64:41 - 64:47)
opinion sorry I don&#39;t like the source of (64:42 - 64:49)
Justice people really don&#39;t like the (64:47 - 64:51)
lake Spirits yeah like Spirits are not (64:49 - 64:54)
as popular uh eggs rockn Rolla Timber (64:51 - 64:57)
Cara blast Shelmet Larvesta in 2K throw (64:54 - 65:00)
sock Heatmor Durant Larvesta in 5K and (64:57 - 65:03)
then 10K will be the maractus sigil (65:00 - 65:07)
boulant Larvesta I think they&#39;re fine um (65:03 - 65:11)
Larvesta is in 10k as well 10K 5K and 2K (65:07 - 65:14)
Larvesta I feel like cotor last year it (65:11 - 65:17)
was just the three it was that could be (65:14 - 65:19)
shiny and the whole whole point was that (65:17 - 65:20)
they could be shiny and but like if you (65:19 - 65:22)
had a bunch of 10ks you were going to (65:20 - 65:26)
hatch those three Pokemon (65:22 - 65:26)
yeah lesta is still rare enough yeah (65:27 - 65:32)
that&#39;s true and it can be shiny so you (65:31 - 65:35)
know people have that uh unknown will (65:32 - 65:39)
spell yova uh I V is like a really (65:35 - 65:42)
sought after shiny unknown V I don&#39;t (65:39 - 65:44)
remember why I think it made its debut (65:42 - 65:45)
in (65:44 - 65:47)
sevie and I (65:45 - 65:51)
think that is the main event it was in (65:47 - 65:54)
so if you have an unknown V it it&#39;s it&#39;s (65:51 - 65:56)
lost its value remove it from your (65:54 - 65:58)
LinkedIn it&#39;s coming back I (65:56 - 66:01)
haven&#39;t uh I should have traded my no (65:58 - 66:02)
actually I think I only have one V and I (66:01 - 66:06)
think it was traded to me from cev uh so (66:02 - 66:07)
I don&#39;t think I could have traded (66:06 - 66:09)
anyways that&#39;s all they have for now um (66:07 - 66:10)
I don&#39;t think we&#39;re going to get a (66:09 - 66:12)
Victini just like I don&#39;t think we&#39;re we (66:10 - 66:13)
got archus I (66:12 - 66:16)
don&#39;t think (66:13 - 66:21)
CIO the tours historically will give us (66:16 - 66:23)
a Pokemon that hasn&#39;t that like a (66:21 - 66:24)
Pokemon a mythical Pokemon in game that (66:23 - 66:26)
hasn&#39;t been shiny before (66:24 - 66:29)
like available right like cotor gave us (66:26 - 66:33)
Shiny Mew uh well um Jor didn&#39;t give a (66:29 - 66:35)
shiny celby because we already had it (66:33 - 66:36)
from other things so they gave us the (66:35 - 66:40)
Apex Shadow Pokemon then hoent Tor gave (66:36 - 66:42)
us uh (66:40 - 66:44)
shiny uh the (66:42 - 66:48)
Gerra uh cotor gave us shiny Shaman and (66:44 - 66:50)
I you know and now you Noor with shiny (66:48 - 66:52)
meoa so it makes s they don&#39;t like they (66:50 - 66:53)
don&#39;t give new they don&#39;t give new (66:52 - 66:55)
mythicals like everybody thought archus (66:53 - 66:57)
was going to be at you know c tour last (66:55 - 67:00)
year but it&#39;s like they don&#39;t do like (66:57 - 67:02)
unreleased stuff at the tours it&#39;s (67:00 - 67:04)
usually like a shiny version of a (67:02 - 67:07)
mythical that&#39;s already been in game non (67:04 - 67:11)
shiny and since Victini and Calo are (67:07 - 67:13)
shiny locked and I doubt the Pokemon (67:11 - 67:14)
company would (67:13 - 67:18)
debut them in this although was Shiny (67:14 - 67:22)
Mew technically Emerald no I know but (67:18 - 67:24)
like you had to have a Japanese Emerald (67:22 - 67:26)
game from like 20 years AG go to get (67:24 - 67:29)
shiny Mew until until Kanto (67:26 - 67:32)
tour so that was kind of new but kind of (67:29 - 67:33)
new (67:32 - 67:38)
yeah um they&#39;re also saying (67:33 - 67:42)
that uh event Poké stops near Metro (67:38 - 67:47)
stations will spawn Sandile mainu paard (67:42 - 67:48)
and (67:47 - 67:52)
Voli near Metro stations mhm near Metro (67:48 - 67:54)
stations throughout Los Angeles County (67:52 - 67:55)
Special Event Poké stops will appear on (67:54 - 67:57)
the game map Team Rocket will appear at (67:55 - 67:59)
these Poké stops and have turned them (67:57 - 68:01)
from Unova region into Shadow Pokemon (67:59 - 68:03)
defeat them so then they have the Shadow (68:01 - 68:06)
Pokemon listed and then they said plus (68:03 - 68:08)
after defeating a shadow grunt you will (68:06 - 68:12)
earn a 12K egg and those 12K eggs will (68:08 - 68:15)
have sandal main Fu paard Voli so just (68:12 - 68:16)
grunts will have the grunts will give (68:15 - 68:18)
you a 10 (68:16 - 68:20)
12K (68:18 - 68:24)
egg so they&#39;re still making Sandile (68:20 - 68:27)
somewhat rare (68:24 - 68:27)
yeah there&#39;s the (68:27 - 68:32)
Marie yeah yeah the new Marie the new (68:29 - 68:34)
Marie that is interesting that they&#39;re (68:32 - 68:36)
focusing on Metro I mean obviously (68:34 - 68:37)
they&#39;re focusing on public (68:36 - 68:39)
transportation it&#39;s just that the public (68:37 - 68:40)
transportation in all of Southern (68:39 - 68:44)
California is awful so yeah basculin and (68:40 - 68:47)
blue stripe and red stripe will appear (68:44 - 68:49)
throughout Roots throughout the (68:47 - 68:53)
city um Roots will be no roots will be (68:49 - 68:55)
accessible at the Rose Bowl or the golf (68:53 - 68:56)
course so there (68:55 - 68:58)
if you want your basine you got to go (68:56 - 69:02)
into the city they did have roots in (68:58 - 69:04)
Pasadena so like I think there was a (69:02 - 69:09)
route from like the Rose Bowl to like (69:04 - 69:11)
the bus stop that you could take so like (69:09 - 69:14)
on your way in or out you could do a (69:11 - 69:17)
route uh the merchandise I think is (69:14 - 69:20)
really good this time around (69:17 - 69:21)
personally the black and white (69:20 - 69:25)
merchandise I think looks good yeah I (69:21 - 69:27)
agreed (69:25 - 69:27)
they probably save some money not (69:28 - 69:31)
printing color but I understand the (69:29 - 69:33)
theme of black and white I think the (69:31 - 69:37)
merch looks pretty good yep it feels (69:33 - 69:39)
like a bunch of Pokemon are (69:37 - 69:44)
missing but well there are a lot of (69:39 - 69:47)
them (69:44 - 69:49)
yeah just I think there&#39;s just going to (69:47 - 69:50)
be a lot (69:49 - 69:53)
of well the the the website though (69:50 - 69:54)
that&#39;s like the stuff like does it say (69:53 - 69:56)
what spawns per (69:54 - 69:59)
uh biome yeah yeah yeah you&#39;ll get your (69:56 - 70:01)
like Litwick and your frillish in the (69:59 - 70:03)
Autumn you&#39;ll get your your trubbish and (70:01 - 70:05)
your dble and your panser in the the (70:03 - 70:08)
vacation the summer you get your (70:05 - 70:10)
Venipede and your duckets in the spring (70:08 - 70:13)
and you get your your axus and your (70:10 - 70:14)
clinks in the (70:13 - 70:16)
winter um so yeah they have a they have (70:14 - 70:19)
a list of of (70:16 - 70:19)
everything uh also like we&#39;re going to (70:20 - 70:27)
get giganta Max garer right like there&#39;s (70:24 - 70:30)
it&#39;s the only gigantamax Gen 5 pokemon (70:27 - 70:35)
there&#39;s no way that it&#39;s not black (70:30 - 70:39)
kierum white kierum gigantamax (70:35 - 70:39)
Garbo regular (70:40 - 70:45)
Garbo yeah they&#39;re going to that would (70:43 - 70:47)
be the biggest Miss in the world if they (70:45 - 70:49)
don&#39;t do gigant Max Garbo they&#39;re gonna (70:47 - 70:51)
yeah they&#39;re going to want to keep the (70:49 - 70:53)
gigantamax stuff up and you know the (70:51 - 70:56)
Dynamax stuff up so (70:53 - 70:58)
that would s we&#39;re getting we&#39;re getting (70:56 - 70:59)
Lapras (70:58 - 71:02)
soon and then we&#39;ll probably have time (70:59 - 71:06)
for maybe Kingler and maybe or Beetle (71:02 - 71:10)
and then the it would be Garbo like I (71:06 - 71:11)
feel like that&#39;s still going pretty (71:10 - 71:14)
quick I think I&#39;m surprised how quick (71:11 - 71:16)
we&#39;re getting Lapras yeah yeah (71:14 - 71:18)
especially because like the last little (71:16 - 71:19)
trailer they showed was literally (71:18 - 71:20)
Kingler (71:19 - 71:23)
and and then there was a big orbal (71:20 - 71:25)
picture and then they were like lapas in (71:23 - 71:27)
December like wait (71:25 - 71:31)
what I mean they might have switched (71:27 - 71:32)
well I don&#39;t know they could have just (71:31 - 71:35)
done Kingler because I was like maybe (71:32 - 71:37)
they switched gears cuz they were like (71:35 - 71:38)
uh we should maybe do a water Pokemon (71:37 - 71:39)
next since everyone just caught an (71:38 - 71:44)
electric Pokemon well so I mean I was (71:39 - 71:48)
thinking uh Lapras being water and ice (71:44 - 71:50)
and it&#39;s December and yeah yeah yeah (71:48 - 71:52)
Northern Hemisphere you know winter ice (71:50 - 71:57)
so uh kind of makes sense but (71:52 - 71:57)
I don&#39;t (71:58 - 72:02)
know yeah and then they&#39;re they&#39;re (71:59 - 72:04)
introducing the max (72:02 - 72:07)
mushrooms which is supposed to double (72:04 - 72:10)
your power they&#39;re expensive they&#39;re 400 (72:07 - 72:13)
for one and then a th000 for (72:10 - 72:17)
three yep (72:13 - 72:20)
I one I think they&#39;re too (72:17 - 72:24)
expensive uh two I&#39;m not exactly sure (72:20 - 72:26)
who&#39;s buying (72:24 - 72:29)
that because again I (72:26 - 72:32)
think I think I I think we&#39;re at this (72:29 - 72:34)
point where people have enough counters (72:32 - 72:37)
or they at least understand it where a (72:34 - 72:40)
group of 25 to 30 can do it Steve you (72:37 - 72:42)
need to go somewhere other than a (72:40 - 72:46)
in-person event or Mall of America and (72:42 - 72:49)
experience this here the the thing is (72:46 - 72:52)
like there there&#39;s not a good situ I I (72:49 - 72:53)
knew this argument was going to come up (72:52 - 72:55)
do you really think like 20 people are (72:53 - 72:57)
to sit there and be like we can&#39;t do it (72:55 - 72:59)
and then one person is like I&#39;ll spend (72:57 - 73:02)
the a th000 coins like maybe we can do (72:59 - 73:06)
it yes 100% guarantee them to do it I (73:02 - 73:08)
don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good (73:06 - 73:11)
solution was a good solution I said 100% (73:08 - 73:14)
gu I don&#39;t think anyone should do that I (73:11 - 73:16)
don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good solution I don&#39;t (73:14 - 73:18)
think anyone it&#39;s been a few weeks since (73:16 - 73:20)
we last talked about it but all of us (73:18 - 73:22)
said that there were situations where (73:20 - 73:24)
each of us would buy this item and it is (73:22 - 73:26)
actually less expensive than I thought (73:24 - 73:29)
it was going to be I think I would I (73:26 - 73:31)
don&#39;t I&#39;d have to like see it actually (73:29 - 73:34)
work I think I think like if I (73:31 - 73:37)
confidently knew I was like going to get (73:34 - 73:40)
through raids quicker with this item I (73:37 - 73:43)
think it&#39;s way too expensive though (73:40 - 73:44)
maybe I would buy it I thought it was (73:43 - 73:48)
going to be five bucks for one like like (73:44 - 73:51)
it I don&#39;t even think the raid itself (73:48 - 73:54)
takes that long I think it&#39;s like again (73:51 - 73:56)
you need to do some of these outside of (73:54 - 73:58)
an inperson event or Mall of America you (73:56 - 74:00)
just said that the raid took like six or (73:58 - 74:03)
seven minutes and that felt long didn&#39;t (74:00 - 74:05)
you it does it does it does feel long (74:03 - 74:06)
but I don&#39;t think the rate itself feels (74:05 - 74:09)
long I think it&#39;s like oh getting to it (74:06 - 74:12)
waiting for everyone to (74:09 - 74:15)
confirm uh if it wasn&#39;t for Safari balls (74:12 - 74:16)
which there were plenty of times where (74:15 - 74:18)
Safari balls were like I did raids after (74:16 - 74:19)
the event was (74:18 - 74:22)
over um and like you&#39;re you&#39;re just (74:19 - 74:23)
sitting there in the catch screen for (74:22 - 74:26)
like two three minutes like (74:23 - 74:28)
R golden Raz excellent throw Premier (74:26 - 74:31)
Ball oh it broke out again (74:28 - 74:34)
like the max mushrooms don&#39;t speed that (74:31 - 74:35)
part of it (74:34 - 74:38)
up and like I don&#39;t like the argument of (74:35 - 74:40)
like you need to play M of America or (74:38 - 74:42)
not an inperson event I played in like (74:40 - 74:45)
17 different cities in Japan like I I I (74:42 - 74:48)
just I just jumped into raids and we did (74:45 - 74:50)
it like I didn&#39;t coordinate with anyone (74:48 - 74:51)
I didn&#39;t like look at a map and be like (74:50 - 74:52)
oh this is where they&#39;re doing raids it (74:51 - 74:55)
was just like oh there&#39;s a raid here oh (74:52 - 74:57)
it&#39;s pH up I&#39;ll jump in (74:55 - 75:00)
too like I just I just go to big cities (74:57 - 75:02)
I just go to areas where I would (75:00 - 75:03)
normally go where it&#39; be like oh the (75:02 - 75:06)
spawn density is good here (75:03 - 75:09)
like none of those electricities were at (75:06 - 75:13)
all America but but like the fact that (75:09 - 75:14)
like but you know like obviously that (75:13 - 75:17)
you can go to a big city and and do the (75:14 - 75:20)
and do the raids and it&#39;s like gonna be (75:17 - 75:22)
I know that everyone should know that (75:20 - 75:23)
right like no everyone knows that but (75:22 - 75:27)
not everybody has that ability (75:23 - 75:29)
I feel like I&#39;m like defending the the (75:27 - 75:30)
the people who live in the middle of (75:29 - 75:32)
nowhere I don&#39;t think this is an item (75:30 - 75:34)
you should (75:32 - 75:37)
buy like here&#39;s the thing as somebody (75:34 - 75:42)
who&#39;s done 55 toxcity raids I stood next (75:37 - 75:48)
to so many Sables and Diles and (75:42 - 75:50)
Charizards (75:48 - 75:51)
and (75:50 - 75:55)
wulu and Drilbur I watched you bring a (75:51 - 75:57)
lot of drill bur to those raids by the (75:55 - 76:00)
way I any forgot about this until (75:57 - 76:03)
now the one time I bought a drill is (76:00 - 76:05)
when I joined and there was 4 seconds (76:03 - 76:08)
left and I couldn&#39;t change my (76:05 - 76:12)
team don&#39;t you start with (76:08 - 76:12)
me but (76:13 - 76:16)
like I think it&#39;s a disingenuous item to (76:18 - 76:25)
be like you are going to double the out (76:22 - 76:28)
output of your team when your team is (76:25 - 76:32)
still bringing bad counters like cool (76:28 - 76:34)
we&#39;re going to double our damage that&#39;s (76:32 - 76:36)
going to be really helpful against for (76:34 - 76:39)
the Sable standing next to me which is (76:36 - 76:42)
weak to Electric like it&#39;s like you&#39;re (76:39 - 76:44)
what are you doubling you&#39;re getting one (76:42 - 76:48)
shot like these people these people the (76:44 - 76:49)
like people standing next to me aren&#39;t (76:48 - 76:53)
even bringing things that would resist (76:49 - 76:57)
like the amount of Charizards Charizard (76:53 - 76:59)
is weak to Electric I don&#39;t know if (76:57 - 77:01)
people know this or not I don&#39;t he&#39;s (76:59 - 77:04)
only been around for 30 years he&#39;s he&#39;s (77:01 - 77:08)
always been weak to Electric um like (77:04 - 77:11)
bring a Bulbasaur or a a Venusaur like (77:08 - 77:15)
grass resist electric you will survive (77:11 - 77:18)
much longer Charizard is not hitting (77:15 - 77:20)
super effective damage against toxcity (77:18 - 77:22)
you know what neither is Venusaur but (77:20 - 77:25)
Venusaur is one way bulkier two resist (77:22 - 77:29)
electric like the (77:25 - 77:31)
problem to your solution isn&#39;t like (77:29 - 77:35)
doubling your damage output it is just (77:31 - 77:37)
fundamentally understanding the game (77:35 - 77:41)
itself which is like evolve your Sable (77:37 - 77:43)
well also don&#39;t bring sabble but like at (77:41 - 77:46)
least evolve it or at least like put (77:43 - 77:49)
some candy and power it (77:46 - 77:51)
up like you&#39;re selling a Sol you&#39;re (77:49 - 77:55)
selling a solution to (77:51 - 78:00)
what isn&#39;t really the (77:55 - 78:00)
problem like the (78:00 - 78:05)
like even if people brought mediocre (78:03 - 78:08)
counters I can keep them alive with Max (78:05 - 78:09)
guard and Max (78:08 - 78:13)
spirit because I can EG gr the boss so (78:09 - 78:15)
they don&#39;t actually end up attacking the (78:13 - 78:17)
Charizard and then eventually the (78:15 - 78:20)
Charizard does enough damage and wins (78:17 - 78:23)
but that&#39;s only because I know what I&#39;m (78:20 - 78:27)
doing so like (78:23 - 78:27)
yes I am sure there is a small community (78:28 - 78:33)
of like 15 people in Appleton Wisconsin (78:30 - 78:35)
that are like one person&#39;s going to bite (78:33 - 78:38)
the bullet and give Niantic (78:35 - 78:43)
$10 but that isn&#39;t great yeah no I I (78:38 - 78:45)
don&#39;t like this item I don&#39;t like that (78:43 - 78:48)
it exists it is the most I think it&#39;s (78:45 - 78:50)
probably one of the most pay to win (78:48 - 78:53)
items we have in some ways that term is (78:50 - 78:54)
complicated yeah I get what you&#39;re (78:53 - 78:56)
saying (78:54 - 78:59)
um but I do think that this is a more (78:56 - 79:02)
common situation than you think it is (78:59 - 79:05)
where there just aren&#39;t enough people (79:02 - 79:07)
and even if their teams are built well (79:05 - 79:10)
even if people are using Max (79:07 - 79:13)
guard they just aren&#39;t able to complete (79:10 - 79:17)
it and having the ability to do the raid (79:13 - 79:20)
lose you didn&#39;t lose your max particles (79:17 - 79:23)
thankfully but try again with the max (79:20 - 79:26)
mushroom and when (79:23 - 79:28)
see a lot of people doing that I just (79:26 - 79:30)
don&#39;t I I don&#39;t realistically think (79:28 - 79:32)
there are 15 people in a neighborhood (79:30 - 79:35)
with actually good teams no but I think (79:32 - 79:38)
that there are eight in a neighborhood (79:35 - 79:40)
with actually good teams and as someone (79:38 - 79:42)
who used to go raid to raid with like (79:40 - 79:44)
two or three people and we would do (79:42 - 79:46)
everything we could to beat like a like (79:44 - 79:48)
legendary or a four-star boss at the (79:46 - 79:50)
time with as little as we could like (79:48 - 79:52)
maxing out our Pokemon to the perfect (79:50 - 79:55)
stats and everything that those groups (79:52 - 79:56)
absolutely exist and I think there are (79:55 - 79:58)
groups of eight or nine who make their (79:56 - 80:01)
Pokemon as perfect as possible and can&#39;t (79:58 - 80:03)
beat a giganta Max rid right now that (80:01 - 80:06)
will be able to with Max mushrooms it (80:03 - 80:07)
doesn&#39;t solve the issue of people (80:06 - 80:09)
bringing I think those are I think those (80:07 - 80:11)
are different people though I think I (80:09 - 80:13)
think you I think we&#39;re talking about (80:11 - 80:15)
two different audiences like there there (80:13 - 80:17)
talking about the item (80:15 - 80:20)
though yes and it works I item will help (80:17 - 80:22)
those small groups that have the perfect (80:20 - 80:24)
Pokemon but don&#39;t have enough people (80:22 - 80:26)
community to do have been in a lot of (80:24 - 80:28)
those groups I have been in at least (80:26 - 80:30)
four different groups like that as I (80:28 - 80:33)
have moved from place to place the the (80:30 - 80:38)
group of like 10 people who know what (80:33 - 80:39)
they&#39;re (80:38 - 80:42)
doing will probably buy the item maybe (80:39 - 80:44)
that&#39;s what nian is aiming for cuz (80:42 - 80:45)
they&#39;re they&#39;re probably buying lucky (80:44 - 80:48)
eggs they&#39;re probably buying star pieces (80:45 - 80:50)
they&#39;re probably buying incubators MH (80:48 - 80:53)
I&#39;m thinking of the group (80:50 - 80:57)
that uh (80:53 - 80:57)
doesn&#39;t one know what they&#39;re doing and (80:57 - 81:02)
they have a bunch of wulu and Sables and (81:00 - 81:07)
number two is you can tell them what to (81:02 - 81:11)
do but they still won&#39;t do it (81:07 - 81:14)
and as as much as you guys are like I I (81:11 - 81:16)
I&#39;ve been with these groups that like (81:14 - 81:16)
they know what they&#39;re doing they&#39;re (81:16 - 81:19)
moving from raid to raid I&#39;m thinking of (81:16 - 81:21)
like the groups I&#39;ve been in where like (81:19 - 81:25)
no one wants to power anything up no one (81:21 - 81:28)
no one wants to evolve anything they (81:25 - 81:30)
just want to go in and hit the button (81:28 - 81:32)
you try to like explain maybe bring (81:30 - 81:34)
different counters they don&#39;t want to do (81:32 - 81:39)
that and I don&#39;t like and this item is (81:34 - 81:42)
preying on those people and the cost is (81:39 - 81:45)
but also you&#39;re not talking to any of (81:42 - 81:47)
these people but you&#39;re also it&#39;s a Sol (81:45 - 81:48)
but your problem is already solved in (81:47 - 81:50)
your situation because you&#39;re winning (81:48 - 81:52)
the raids so yes you&#39;re watching people (81:50 - 81:54)
bring Sables and wulu and things but (81:52 - 81:56)
you&#39;re winning those raids because those (81:54 - 81:58)
people are in groups of 40 where there (81:56 - 82:00)
is a portion of them that are carrying (81:58 - 82:02)
those teams to win the raids we&#39;re (82:00 - 82:04)
talking about so those people never have (82:02 - 82:06)
to learn not in that situation those (82:04 - 82:08)
people will never learn correct yes (82:06 - 82:10)
because they don&#39;t have to and and (82:08 - 82:11)
people in these smaller groups they do (82:10 - 82:14)
have to learn right they will learn (82:11 - 82:15)
because they&#39;ll have to learn because (82:14 - 82:17)
they can&#39;t do it any other way but I (82:15 - 82:18)
think I it&#39;s already been proven that (82:17 - 82:21)
like you don&#39;t need 40 people I mean (82:18 - 82:23)
Gengar was beat with four people (82:21 - 82:25)
Blastoise was beat with eight people (82:23 - 82:27)
yeah but you do need some people and (82:25 - 82:28)
some of these groups are going to be (82:27 - 82:31)
smaller than (82:28 - 82:31)
that I mean I guess I just think you (82:31 - 82:38)
benefit smaller groups who can who have (82:35 - 82:39)
the right things but they&#39;re just a (82:38 - 82:41)
small they&#39;re just a smaller group that (82:39 - 82:43)
doesn&#39;t have the ability to do it again (82:41 - 82:44)
I&#39;m not saying that this is the right (82:43 - 82:46)
way or that it&#39;s not too expensive or (82:44 - 82:47)
whatever I am saying that this item (82:46 - 82:50)
shouldn&#39;t exist yeah well okay but I&#39;m (82:47 - 82:52)
saying that it does benefit people who (82:50 - 82:55)
are in much smaller groups or even maybe (82:52 - 82:57)
a couple you&#39;re saying Gengar was beat (82:55 - 82:59)
with four maybe Lapras will be able to (82:57 - 83:01)
beat with two with these Max mushrooms (82:59 - 83:03)
right no there&#39;s no way there&#39;s no way (83:01 - 83:04)
they they&#39;ve already ran through the (83:03 - 83:06)
Cals you need at least eight people for (83:04 - 83:08)
Lapras with the max mushrooms with the (83:06 - 83:10)
max mushroom even even with Max (83:08 - 83:13)
mushrooms okay like the bare minimum for (83:10 - 83:14)
Lapras is going to need unless like (83:13 - 83:16)
something dramatically changes or the (83:14 - 83:19)
Cals are wrong but Lapras is way way (83:16 - 83:22)
bulkier makes sense so bulky toxicity (83:19 - 83:24)
makes sense but like Gengar and toxicity (83:22 - 83:26)
are super frail like toxcity had a four (83:24 - 83:28)
times weakness oh right and ganger has (83:26 - 83:31)
always been a glass Cannon so yeah like (83:28 - 83:33)
I don&#39;t think Lapras has a four times (83:31 - 83:35)
week it&#39;s like weak to fighting and it&#39;s (83:33 - 83:37)
weak to Electric but it&#39;s not four times (83:35 - 83:39)
weak I hate ever ever fighting Lapras (83:37 - 83:41)
it&#39;s it&#39;s always annoying to battle a (83:39 - 83:44)
Lapras but I still think that this does (83:41 - 83:46)
cater more toward those smaller groups (83:44 - 83:49)
that are doing things properly um and (83:46 - 83:50)
I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s going to work for (83:49 - 83:52)
the like yes you bring eight people with (83:50 - 83:54)
all Sables to a battle it&#39;s just not (83:52 - 83:55)
going to work and this is not going to (83:54 - 83:57)
help it absolutely but I&#39;ve been in (83:55 - 83:59)
enough groups with small amounts of (83:57 - 84:01)
people who do everything right and they (83:59 - 84:03)
just don&#39;t have enough people or power (84:01 - 84:06)
to do the thing and this does help that (84:03 - 84:08)
and they will buy these they will buy (84:06 - 84:11)
these mushrooms when that coming that&#39;s (84:08 - 84:13)
that&#39;s crazy to me I just I just think (84:11 - 84:15)
like (84:13 - 84:17)
there&#39;s it just feels like you&#39;re (84:15 - 84:21)
rubbing more salt in the wound of like (84:17 - 84:23)
people who again I just I guess I I I (84:21 - 84:25)
just think of the people who don&#39;t know (84:23 - 84:27)
what they&#39;re doing or like just 15 (84:25 - 84:29)
people where like some people know what (84:27 - 84:30)
they&#39;re doing but no like other people (84:29 - 84:33)
don&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing (84:30 - 84:36)
and somebody bites the bullet spends the (84:33 - 84:39)
$10 activate or for $4 I guess activates (84:36 - 84:41)
the mushroom and then they still fail (84:39 - 84:43)
and now everyone&#39;s upset especially the (84:41 - 84:45)
person who spent the money well think (84:43 - 84:48)
about think about raids like think about (84:45 - 84:50)
raids when you go in and you you fail a (84:48 - 84:53)
raid and like you don&#39;t get to get that (84:50 - 84:55)
money back if the raid ends the ends (84:53 - 84:57)
like and that&#39;s it like there was a lot (84:55 - 84:58)
of there&#39;s been a lot of frustration (84:57 - 85:00)
with that I&#39;ve been a part of a lot of (84:58 - 85:02)
that frustration in the past like this (85:00 - 85:06)
is not a new issue it&#39;s just a different (85:02 - 85:10)
item that&#39;s taking money from people (85:06 - 85:10)
yeah I I I don&#39;t know I guess I guess (85:10 - 85:14)
the point I&#39;m making is I would rather (85:13 - 85:17)
not have the item exist because I I (85:14 - 85:19)
think that we already we already have (85:17 - 85:20)
the frustration of like I don&#39;t have (85:19 - 85:23)
enough people versus now we&#39;re going to (85:20 - 85:24)
have the frustration of I bought the (85:23 - 85:27)
item and we still don&#39;t have enough (85:24 - 85:29)
people and I think (85:27 - 85:32)
that&#39;s but you&#39;re also going to have the (85:29 - 85:35)
people that now are a small group that (85:32 - 85:39)
can beat it yeah maybe yeah that group (85:35 - 85:41)
is going to exist that group is (85:39 - 85:43)
absolutely going to lose people are (85:41 - 85:44)
going to want to try and iterate and (85:43 - 85:47)
grow a lot of the time not all of the (85:44 - 85:49)
time the people you&#39;re seeing are people (85:47 - 85:51)
who are still winning regardless of them (85:49 - 85:53)
bringing in a savel so a lot of the time (85:51 - 85:54)
when people lose these raids they&#39;re (85:53 - 85:56)
going to want to get better at it to (85:54 - 85:58)
come back and do more and so these (85:56 - 86:02)
groups are going to lose less and as we (85:58 - 86:04)
have this item smaller and smaller (86:02 - 86:07)
groups will have that (86:04 - 86:07)
opportunity yeah I like I don&#39;t I want (86:09 - 86:15)
to sit here I wish it didn&#39;t cost money (86:13 - 86:17)
that&#39;s the yeah I I don&#39;t and I don&#39;t I (86:15 - 86:18)
definitely don&#39;t want to sit here and (86:17 - 86:20)
say like you guys are wrong I just I (86:18 - 86:23)
just I don&#39;t like this item existing at (86:20 - 86:25)
all even though your guys&#39;s argument is (86:23 - 86:27)
like it will help some people which I (86:25 - 86:29)
don&#39;t disagree with but I think what (86:27 - 86:31)
will help what would help more people is (86:29 - 86:34)
Niantic not introducing this item and (86:31 - 86:37)
just telling us how to max raid because (86:34 - 86:40)
they still letting people remote in 100% (86:37 - 86:44)
they haven&#39;t done that and I in in Japan (86:40 - 86:46)
I met up with some people and they were (86:44 - 86:47)
like this is the first time we&#39;re able (86:46 - 86:49)
to Max raid (86:47 - 86:53)
right um they they just they they just (86:49 - 86:55)
NE they live in saitamas so they not as (86:53 - 86:58)
big as Tokyo so they came out and I was (86:55 - 86:59)
watching them do it and they they (86:58 - 87:01)
literally only had three they had the (86:59 - 87:04)
wulu they had the sabble they had what (87:01 - 87:06)
like the dribble right they had like the (87:04 - 87:08)
three worst Pokemon that well driers I (87:06 - 87:11)
guess okay um but like I was watching (87:08 - 87:12)
them do it cuz I already finished the (87:11 - 87:14)
raid and they just didn&#39;t know what (87:12 - 87:16)
anything did I was like oh those three (87:14 - 87:17)
little lines that means you dodge you (87:16 - 87:19)
swipe left and right they were like oh (87:17 - 87:20)
and I was like oh this little icon here (87:19 - 87:22)
that&#39;s max power you need to swipe to (87:20 - 87:23)
pick that up and they were like oh my (87:22 - 87:26)
gosh I didn&#39;t know yeah that&#39;s never (87:23 - 87:28)
explained none of that is explained or (87:26 - 87:29)
like when you&#39;re G when you&#39;re (87:28 - 87:32)
gigantamaxing or dynamaxing like that (87:29 - 87:35)
countdown you can switch Pokemon like (87:32 - 87:37)
also not explained of like why you would (87:35 - 87:40)
do that and like but where do you want (87:37 - 87:43)
them to explain all of this because like (87:40 - 87:45)
to Hannah&#39;s point before like people (87:43 - 87:47)
aren&#39;t go like you&#39;re saying that they (87:45 - 87:48)
need to explain all of it but are people (87:47 - 87:50)
going to read a guide about it because (87:48 - 87:52)
they&#39;re not force force a raid in the (87:50 - 87:55)
game to teach you how to do it (87:52 - 87:57)
they did have the research they made (87:55 - 88:00)
people do the Dynamax raids they just (87:57 - 88:02)
never explain when you do your first (88:00 - 88:04)
Dynamax raid how to do any of this they (88:02 - 88:06)
rely on people telling each other and (88:04 - 88:07)
they rely on people figuring it out on (88:06 - 88:11)
their own yeah I figured it all out on (88:07 - 88:15)
my own it&#39;s doable it&#39;s doable I still (88:11 - 88:19)
think that there okay okay so if you (88:15 - 88:21)
have a smaller amount of people who are (88:19 - 88:24)
trying to do a Max raid and it&#39;s not (88:21 - 88:27)
working chances are that small group of (88:24 - 88:29)
people is not going to continue to take (88:27 - 88:31)
the same Pokemon into the same raid over (88:29 - 88:33)
and over and over and over and over (88:31 - 88:35)
again and expect different results yeah (88:33 - 88:37)
they&#39;re going to learn that okay this (88:35 - 88:39)
didn&#39;t work let me try like they&#39;re (88:37 - 88:41)
going to eventually learn that this (88:39 - 88:43)
isn&#39;t working now if you have a group of (88:41 - 88:44)
people who&#39;s in a big group and they do (88:43 - 88:47)
it once and it and they win there&#39;s no (88:44 - 88:49)
reason to learn what you&#39;re doing (88:47 - 88:51)
because you just it just worked and you (88:49 - 88:54)
won but these small groups of people (88:51 - 88:56)
they&#39;re going to have to learn like okay (88:54 - 88:57)
well this didn&#39;t work against it but (88:56 - 89:00)
this other thing might work better and (88:57 - 89:02)
they&#39;re going to then they&#39;re going to (89:00 - 89:05)
learn but and so I still think this item (89:02 - 89:08)
is giving the smaller groups of people a (89:05 - 89:10)
better chance at winning than it did (89:08 - 89:13)
before and yes if they bring in Sables (89:10 - 89:14)
and they bring in those things it&#39;s not (89:13 - 89:15)
going to work but like the smaller (89:14 - 89:18)
groups are going to learn over time that (89:15 - 89:20)
they need to change those things up in (89:18 - 89:21)
order to win or they&#39;re going to go to (89:20 - 89:24)
the big groups and go in and win that (89:21 - 89:25)
way like one of those two things is (89:24 - 89:27)
going to happen you&#39;re not going to have (89:25 - 89:29)
someone in a group of four bringing a (89:27 - 89:33)
sable every day for 3 weeks to the same (89:29 - 89:36)
raid that gets destroyed in 10 seconds (89:33 - 89:38)
they&#39;re going to eventually be like this (89:36 - 89:39)
isn&#39;t working like I have to do (89:38 - 89:42)
something different I think you guys (89:39 - 89:44)
have way too much faith in people I (89:42 - 89:48)
think I think you have way too much like (89:44 - 89:50)
really think you okay you really think (89:48 - 89:52)
an individual is GNA go to a raid with (89:50 - 89:56)
three people bring a sable for multiple (89:52 - 89:58)
days at a time and get the exact same (89:56 - 89:59)
results and never think that they need (89:58 - 90:02)
to change that like from the result (89:59 - 90:03)
they&#39;re getting where they lose every (90:02 - 90:05)
single time I have been around so many (90:03 - 90:08)
people that like we would we would like (90:05 - 90:09)
get to a dark cry or we would get to (90:08 - 90:11)
like a a Cresselia and it would it would (90:09 - 90:14)
only be like three of us and we would (90:11 - 90:16)
get to like literally 5 (90:14 - 90:19)
HP and then the timer would run out and (90:16 - 90:20)
then we would do it again and get to 5 (90:19 - 90:22)
HP and then I would be like hey can I (90:20 - 90:24)
just like look what Pokemon you&#39;re using (90:22 - 90:25)
and and none of their Pokémon are (90:24 - 90:27)
powered up and I&#39;m just like just like (90:25 - 90:29)
power up like your Tyranitar it&#39;s like (90:27 - 90:32)
super effective the same day the same (90:29 - 90:34)
raid they probably are used to being in (90:32 - 90:36)
bigger groups where they don&#39;t have to (90:34 - 90:38)
care and you&#39;re teaching them you (90:36 - 90:40)
literally what saying this is yeah and (90:38 - 90:42)
then they you know what they did they (90:40 - 90:44)
didn&#39;t want to power up their Tyranitar (90:42 - 90:45)
because they were like I don&#39;t want to (90:44 - 90:46)
waste my Stardust I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know (90:45 - 90:48)
this isn&#39;t the one I want to power up (90:46 - 90:52)
Tyran I mean this is this is the problem (90:48 - 90:54)
with this is like part of the problem (90:52 - 90:57)
with Pokémon go is people will like (90:54 - 90:59)
watch content creators or they&#39;ll talk (90:57 - 91:01)
to other people like in person and (90:59 - 91:04)
they&#39;ll be like uh oh if it&#39;s not uh if (91:01 - 91:05)
it&#39;s not 100% I don&#39;t want to power it (91:04 - 91:08)
up and then they will forever Chase 100% (91:05 - 91:09)
and never get it and therefore never (91:08 - 91:13)
power anything up where that&#39;s why like (91:09 - 91:15)
literally 45 minutes ago I was praising (91:13 - 91:18)
Mighty Pokemon because it (91:15 - 91:21)
increases and makes the game just better (91:18 - 91:24)
for everyone because instead of them (91:21 - 91:28)
bringing their level 20 Zapdos that they (91:24 - 91:30)
caught eight years ago they&#39;re now (91:28 - 91:32)
bringing a level 44 Pidgeot that will (91:30 - 91:37)
just do more damage but I I (91:32 - 91:40)
don&#39;t I I just don&#39;t (91:37 - 91:43)
think I just you you guys have just so (91:40 - 91:46)
much faith in people changing like (91:43 - 91:48)
getting better when it&#39;s like why aren&#39;t (91:46 - 91:50)
your why why isn&#39;t your wulu evolved why (91:48 - 91:52)
isn&#39;t your drill bur evolved why haven&#39;t (91:50 - 91:53)
you unlocked Max guard why haven&#39;t you (91:52 - 91:56)
unlocked Max Spirit why haven&#39;t you just (91:53 - 91:59)
powered up your drill bur like cuz they (91:56 - 92:00)
haven&#39;t had to do this before and they (91:59 - 92:03)
don&#39;t know how because the game doesn&#39;t (92:00 - 92:05)
explain or teach people and this is a (92:03 - 92:08)
still a new mechanic but but the game (92:05 - 92:10)
does tell you to like for eight years (92:08 - 92:11)
you&#39;re supposed to be powering up (92:10 - 92:14)
Pokemon to do raids but like they&#39;re so (92:11 - 92:17)
stuck they&#39;re so stuck in a way of (92:14 - 92:20)
like raids have been the same for eight (92:17 - 92:24)
years right like you can just join a z (92:20 - 92:26)
at to raid with like six Stantler and be (92:24 - 92:28)
like I I won cuz you&#39;re you&#39;re just (92:26 - 92:30)
tapping the button right and like (92:28 - 92:31)
there&#39;s like 10 other people there and (92:30 - 92:32)
those people are going to carry you I (92:31 - 92:34)
get what you guys are saying that like (92:32 - 92:36)
other people are carrying them so they (92:34 - 92:38)
don&#39;t need to do anything I understand (92:36 - 92:42)
that I I totally get that but (92:38 - 92:45)
like the game also doesn&#39;t teach you (92:42 - 92:47)
about resistances and people are (92:45 - 92:51)
bringing Pokemon that are weak to the (92:47 - 92:55)
thing they are fighting game about (92:51 - 92:58)
resistances which Pokemon game teaches (92:55 - 93:01)
you about resistances all of them all of (92:58 - 93:03)
them all literally in the second town of (93:01 - 93:06)
all every game talk to people they teach (93:03 - 93:07)
you about (93:06 - 93:10)
resistances okay but what do you have to (93:07 - 93:14)
do to do that talk to people okay and (93:10 - 93:16)
Pokemon go is a real world game so what (93:14 - 93:17)
do you think you have to do to figure (93:16 - 93:20)
those things out if you if you have been (93:17 - 93:23)
playing this game for8 years and your (93:20 - 93:25)
logic is I&#39;m going to a flying type (93:23 - 93:29)
Pokemon to an electric raid that that is (93:25 - 93:31)
on you at this then why do you think if (93:29 - 93:32)
that&#39;s happening then why do you think (93:31 - 93:34)
they&#39;re going to do any different by by (93:32 - 93:36)
Niantic feeding them how to do it in a (93:34 - 93:38)
Max raid if they&#39;re still bringing these (93:36 - 93:40)
things to a regular raid that don&#39;t make (93:38 - 93:41)
any sense after eight years of raids (93:40 - 93:43)
being around that&#39;s why I think the item (93:41 - 93:46)
is bad that&#39;s why but the item actually (93:43 - 93:48)
does something the guides clearly aren&#39;t (93:46 - 93:50)
because people have known for eight (93:48 - 93:51)
years how to do a raid and they&#39;re still (93:50 - 93:53)
not doing raids correctly so a guide on (93:51 - 93:56)
a new raid system isn&#39;t going to help I (93:53 - 93:59)
I think something in the game that would (93:56 - 94:02)
like you know go go through this and and (93:59 - 94:04)
get like two lucky eggs for completing (94:02 - 94:07)
this tutorial and forcing you to (94:04 - 94:10)
understand what maxg guard does and then (94:07 - 94:12)
another tutorial of forcing you to (94:10 - 94:14)
understand what Max Spirit does like (94:12 - 94:18)
simulate a a four-person thing where you (94:14 - 94:20)
are supposed to be the the the the (94:18 - 94:22)
Healer simulate a thing where you&#39;re (94:20 - 94:24)
supposed to be the tank simulate the (94:22 - 94:25)
thing where you&#39;re supposed to do the (94:24 - 94:29)
damage yep they do this in Final Fantasy (94:25 - 94:33)
14 it well like I would rather have (94:29 - 94:35)
Niantic do that than to introduce an (94:33 - 94:38)
item which doubles your damage for (94:35 - 94:41)
money which half of the players in the (94:38 - 94:43)
raid will never see the benefit of (94:41 - 94:46)
because they are getting one shot by The (94:43 - 94:48)
Raid (94:46 - 94:51)
boss so they will never actually see (94:48 - 94:53)
that benefit I think there&#39;s room for (94:51 - 94:54)
both (94:53 - 94:56)
but as long as you have these things (94:54 - 94:58)
that are too powerful for people that (94:56 - 95:02)
are a small amount of people to do again (94:58 - 95:03)
as somebody who comes from these (95:02 - 95:07)
communities in a large city that does it (95:03 - 95:10)
this way who uses like tiny groups to do (95:07 - 95:12)
these raids and things like that yes I (95:10 - 95:14)
can absolutely go find a big group to do (95:12 - 95:17)
uh a Max raid with in my city however I (95:14 - 95:19)
have a group of three friends that I (95:17 - 95:21)
want to go do this with and this gives (95:19 - 95:22)
me that opportunity to do with a smaller (95:21 - 95:24)
amount of people I think on a college (95:22 - 95:27)
campus where we had a group of 30 to 40 (95:24 - 95:29)
active players at a time but even then (95:27 - 95:31)
you could only get maybe 5 10 people for (95:29 - 95:33)
a single raid at a time I have lived in (95:31 - 95:35)
an apartment building where I became (95:33 - 95:37)
friends with three other Pokémon go (95:35 - 95:38)
players in that apartment building and I (95:37 - 95:40)
just went to events with them and maybe (95:38 - 95:43)
we could do some raids specifically (95:40 - 95:45)
because of this item with that size (95:43 - 95:48)
group I have lived in a neighborhood (95:45 - 95:50)
where there was regular where there were (95:48 - 95:53)
regularly 10 hardcore good friend (95:50 - 95:55)
players who all played together this is (95:53 - 95:57)
not an uncommon thing this is how people (95:55 - 95:59)
play the (95:57 - 96:01)
game I think it&#39;s helpful to them I (95:59 - 96:03)
don&#39;t again I think it&#39;s too expensive (96:01 - 96:05)
but I think the item (96:03 - 96:07)
isn&#39;t I think the item is worth it I (96:05 - 96:10)
think what you&#39;re saying should also be (96:07 - 96:12)
implemented you&#39;re like the guide on how (96:10 - 96:14)
to don&#39;t like the item I just think (96:12 - 96:17)
it&#39;ll help but so would letting people (96:14 - 96:20)
remote into (96:17 - 96:20)
these yeah I mean like the the as as (96:20 - 96:28)
somebody who&#39;s done more max raids than (96:25 - 96:30)
probably a lot of people (96:28 - 96:33)
listening I don&#39;t even think that (96:30 - 96:35)
problem is damage output I don&#39;t even (96:33 - 96:37)
think like oh double your damage because (96:35 - 96:39)
you&#39;re not in these small groups that (96:37 - 96:42)
that are trying no I don&#39;t I don&#39;t think (96:39 - 96:45)
it&#39;s D output at all you haven&#39;t been in (96:42 - 96:47)
a two to three person group doing this (96:45 - 96:48)
you haven&#39;t been in the small groups (96:47 - 96:50)
that fail because there just aren&#39;t what (96:48 - 96:53)
are you guys I literally beat toxcity (96:50 - 96:55)
with like 16 (96:53 - 96:58)
people but that&#39;s 16 people I&#39;m talking (96:55 - 96:59)
about like like I&#39;m talking about (96:58 - 97:03)
minimum of being able to do this you you (96:59 - 97:06)
think the mushroom will let minimum be (97:03 - 97:09)
able to do it there will be a minimum (97:06 - 97:12)
every time Min yes more minimum than the (97:09 - 97:14)
mushroom will make it smaller okay again (97:12 - 97:16)
as somebody who&#39;s done more max raids (97:14 - 97:18)
than everyone else I don&#39;t think it&#39;s (97:16 - 97:20)
the damage that&#39;s the problem because (97:18 - 97:24)
most Max raid bosses will end up one one (97:20 - 97:26)
to two shotting you and you have three (97:24 - 97:28)
Pokemon that&#39;s it you don&#39;t get to come (97:26 - 97:29)
back in with more and after that you get (97:28 - 97:32)
to cheer so if everyone&#39;s damage is (97:29 - 97:34)
increased and no one understands the (97:32 - 97:37)
fundamental mechanics of one resistances (97:34 - 97:40)
two tanking three healing there and (97:37 - 97:41)
everyone&#39;s just hitting the attack (97:40 - 97:44)
button which is very common they are all (97:41 - 97:46)
just going to get one shot and that (97:44 - 97:48)
damage does not matter because they are (97:46 - 97:50)
not alive now when you do have some (97:48 - 97:53)
players like me who is sitting there and (97:50 - 97:56)
using Max y on a Pokemon that resists (97:53 - 97:58)
electricity which is like Venusaur so (97:56 - 98:01)
not only am I taking all the eggo I&#39;m (97:58 - 98:03)
also resisting it so I last longer and I (98:01 - 98:06)
am keeping those Sables alive because (98:03 - 98:08)
they are no longer being targeted then (98:06 - 98:11)
yes they can do damage but again that (98:08 - 98:14)
doesn&#39;t work on a $4 item when people (98:11 - 98:17)
are just attacking but that&#39;s it&#39;s a (98:14 - 98:20)
combination a combination yeah there (98:17 - 98:21)
still have to be people attacking to get (98:20 - 98:24)
the boss knocked out so I&#39;m talking (98:21 - 98:25)
about people who are playing the game (98:24 - 98:27)
correctly it&#39;s just that less of them (98:25 - 98:29)
can do it now they less of them can play (98:27 - 98:32)
correctly a smaller group can can play (98:29 - 98:34)
correctly because they still have to (98:32 - 98:37)
attack somebody has yes no don&#39;t worry (98:34 - 98:38)
you don&#39;t have to worry about attacking (98:37 - 98:41)
everyone is attacking that&#39;s in the (98:38 - 98:42)
scenario where they&#39;re not playing it (98:41 - 98:44)
correctly I&#39;m talking about people who&#39; (98:42 - 98:45)
have learned how to play it correctly (98:44 - 98:47)
and can now do it with a smaller group (98:45 - 98:49)
of people everyone knows what they&#39;re (98:47 - 98:50)
doing in this scenario that I&#39;m talking (98:49 - 98:52)
about atast it&#39;s not uncommon it&#39;s just (98:50 - 98:56)
that in giant 4 person groups or even 18 (98:52 - 98:58)
20 person groups people aren&#39;t playing (98:56 - 98:59)
it correctly but they&#39;re still winning (98:58 - 99:01)
so they&#39;re not needing to learn I was (98:59 - 99:03)
also in a group of 17 that beat the (99:01 - 99:05)
toxitricity and I was the only person (99:03 - 99:07)
using Max spirit because I could see (99:05 - 99:09)
everyone else was attacking in my group (99:07 - 99:12)
but we won so no one needed to learn (99:09 - 99:13)
that they didn&#39;t need to do that cuz (99:12 - 99:16)
they won mhm it&#39;s different when you (99:13 - 99:18)
have a group of a small group they will (99:16 - 99:20)
play it correctly and now they can be in (99:18 - 99:22)
a smaller group playing it correctly you (99:20 - 99:24)
both have way too much faith players no (99:22 - 99:26)
I&#39;ve just been a part of these groups (99:24 - 99:29)
that areou that what (99:26 - 99:32)
they&#39;re the small iners communities they (99:29 - 99:35)
exist they will learn I&#39;m not saying the (99:32 - 99:37)
Sables won&#39;t like they will still bring (99:35 - 99:40)
Sables those people will also exist but (99:37 - 99:42)
there are small groups that learn and (99:40 - 99:44)
know what they&#39;re doing where literally (99:42 - 99:45)
the thing holding them back is they&#39;re (99:44 - 99:49)
not powerful enough to beat the the the (99:45 - 99:50)
boss that there just aren&#39;t enough (99:49 - 99:52)
people there just aren&#39;t enough people (99:50 - 99:55)
and this allows that to change (99:52 - 99:55)
okay so would letting people remote in (99:56 - 100:00)
but that wouldn&#39;t have people spending (99:58 - 100:03)
as much money (100:00 - 100:03)
potentially yeah I mean (100:06 - 100:11)
I the remoting in thing is a whole (100:08 - 100:12)
another (100:11 - 100:15)
argument I&#39;m just in my head comparing (100:12 - 100:17)
how how remoting in is to the max (100:15 - 100:19)
mushrooms and kind of it&#39;s a it&#39;s a (100:17 - 100:21)
weird comparison but it is a whole (100:19 - 100:24)
different discussion yeah yeah cuz like (100:21 - 100:26)
technically a Max mushroom should affect (100:24 - 100:29)
everyone in the raid right so like if (100:26 - 100:32)
it&#39;s doing 50% more damage for (100:29 - 100:35)
everyone yeah no mechanically that way (100:32 - 100:38)
it&#39;s different but ultimately both of (100:35 - 100:40)
them result in more damage being there (100:38 - 100:42)
to make the raid (100:40 - 100:45)
easier right but the remoting I mean to (100:42 - 100:46)
we all know like the remoting goes (100:45 - 100:48)
against like they don&#39;t want more people (100:46 - 100:50)
remoting they want more people in person (100:48 - 100:52)
so except now they&#39;re making it possible (100:50 - 100:55)
for smaller groups I don&#39;t know it&#39;s (100:52 - 100:58)
it&#39;s a different thing well smaller (100:55 - 101:01)
groups that are still in prison (100:58 - 101:06)
yes yeah sure I guess I I think like (101:01 - 101:09)
if thematically the max mushroom makes (101:06 - 101:11)
sense because like that&#39;s what it did in (101:09 - 101:13)
sword and shield if your Pokemon was (101:11 - 101:15)
holding a Max Mushroom in battle you (101:13 - 101:17)
would get a damage boost a defense boost (101:15 - 101:21)
a speed boost so like as an (101:17 - 101:24)
item it it it aligns with what the core (101:21 - 101:27)
purpose of it was the other part of that (101:24 - 101:30)
item is if you took three make the soup (101:27 - 101:32)
give the soup to a Pokemon so I think (101:30 - 101:35)
like I wouldn&#39;t be as annoyed that this (101:32 - 101:36)
item (101:35 - 101:38)
exists (101:36 - 101:43)
if um the max soup rolled out with (101:38 - 101:46)
it where it was like yes you could buy (101:43 - 101:49)
this item and you could boost if you (101:46 - 101:51)
needed it or you could buy this item and (101:49 - 101:54)
then make the max soup for $10 $10 and (101:51 - 101:57)
then like turn your current Charmander (101:54 - 102:00)
into a Charizard which again I think (101:57 - 102:03)
would be much better for players because (102:00 - 102:06)
I think most people are just bringing (102:03 - 102:08)
wrong or poor (102:06 - 102:10)
counters and some people didn&#39;t even (102:08 - 102:14)
want to experience this gigantamax (102:10 - 102:16)
Dynamax thing because they already had a (102:14 - 102:19)
shiny charizard they already had a level (102:16 - 102:21)
40 Blastoise and they don&#39;t want to (102:19 - 102:24)
start over and do it again mhm and so if (102:21 - 102:26)
there was a way to (102:24 - 102:28)
like do a quest line or like once a week (102:26 - 102:30)
you have a chance of getting Max (102:28 - 102:32)
mushroom through your field whatever (102:30 - 102:33)
that&#39;s called where you do the 7-Day (102:32 - 102:36)
research and the max mushro breakthough (102:33 - 102:39)
research yeah um and you could save Max (102:36 - 102:41)
mushrooms to then eventually turn (102:39 - 102:43)
something into a gigantamax Pokemon I (102:41 - 102:47)
think that would be cool mhm I just (102:43 - 102:50)
think one the max mushrooms is way too (102:47 - 102:53)
soon in a mechanic where not enough (102:50 - 102:56)
people people have learned it and it (102:53 - 102:58)
doesn&#39;t do the other thing so I think if (102:56 - 103:01)
they if they if they held off on the max (102:58 - 103:03)
mushroom and they introduced it of like (103:01 - 103:05)
it can do this or it can do the max soup (103:03 - 103:07)
which everyone wants I think I would be (103:05 - 103:11)
less negative on it now do you really (103:07 - 103:12)
think that the max soup will make (103:11 - 103:14)
Pokemon gigantamax I think it&#39;ll just (103:12 - 103:17)
make Pokemon (103:14 - 103:17)
Dynamax standard Pokemon can&#39;t Dynamax (103:18 - 103:22)
to begin with and that&#39;s different and (103:21 - 103:25)
annoying (103:22 - 103:28)
the max soup made Pokemon (103:25 - 103:30)
gigantamax Series game but any Pokemon (103:28 - 103:32)
could in the main Series game yeah yeah (103:30 - 103:34)
yeah yeah (103:32 - 103:34)
yeah I think that I do Wonder (103:35 - 103:43)
like if the and maybe this is already (103:40 - 103:46)
known but if the max mushroom was really (103:43 - 103:49)
like was going to come out was going to (103:46 - 103:51)
come out this quickly or like if it was (103:49 - 103:53)
the feedback of like how hard these were (103:51 - 103:54)
that they kind of rolled it out quicker (103:53 - 103:56)
than they were going to because they (103:54 - 103:58)
were like well if nothing else like this (103:56 - 104:03)
giv like a boost like an attack boost uh (103:58 - 104:04)
and I wonder if it was a little bit of (104:03 - 104:06)
if they kind of changed plans a little (104:04 - 104:08)
bit because I do kind of agree I do (104:06 - 104:10)
think like Max sup will eventually come (104:08 - 104:12)
but I do wonder if they want to roll out (104:10 - 104:16)
more gigantamax Pokemon before then just (104:12 - 104:18)
cuz I could see them wanting to do that (104:16 - 104:20)
I don&#39;t know I I know because this seems (104:18 - 104:22)
to be the mechanic right they want the (104:20 - 104:26)
gigantamax Pokemon on to be what people (104:22 - 104:27)
are going after like they&#39;re clearly (104:26 - 104:30)
going to be doing this like G play Loop (104:27 - 104:33)
yeah and so but if you if you then (104:30 - 104:37)
introduce the max soup too early like we (104:33 - 104:39)
have all these Dynamax charmanders and (104:37 - 104:40)
Dynamax you know Bulbasaur and stuff (104:39 - 104:41)
what&#39;s going to be the purpose of (104:40 - 104:43)
anybody going out and doing those (104:41 - 104:45)
gigantamax raids if I can just turn my (104:43 - 104:46)
Dynamax Charmander into a gigantamax (104:45 - 104:48)
Charmander right (104:46 - 104:50)
now right (104:48 - 104:53)
yeah that&#39;s why I don&#39;t think Max soup (104:50 - 104:54)
is here right now now is cuz they want (104:53 - 104:56)
people to establish the loop so I wonder (104:54 - 104:59)
if Max mushrooms were like only are (104:56 - 105:00)
coming out as early as they are because (104:59 - 105:02)
people of of how much feedback there was (105:00 - 105:06)
about how hard these raids were whereas (105:02 - 105:07)
like maybe that would have come out (105:06 - 105:09)
later and been more in line with Max (105:07 - 105:11)
soup but now it&#39;s like oh well we&#39;ll (105:09 - 105:13)
we&#39;ll put this we&#39;ll roll this out now (105:11 - 105:15)
and then it gives people a chance to (105:13 - 105:18)
like have an attack boost in there with (105:15 - 105:21)
their Pokemon yeah I&#39;m not at all (105:18 - 105:22)
surprised that they&#39;re coming out (105:21 - 105:23)
separately for all of those reasons we (105:22 - 105:25)
don&#39;t the gamep playay loop isn&#39;t (105:23 - 105:27)
established enough for Max soup to come (105:25 - 105:29)
out regardless of whether it turns (105:27 - 105:31)
Pokemon Dynamax or (105:29 - 105:35)
gigantamax um max mushrooms though it it (105:31 - 105:36)
does seem like what you&#39;re saying Bobby (105:35 - 105:38)
where they saw that people were (105:36 - 105:39)
struggling (105:38 - 105:41)
and either they want to help or they (105:39 - 105:43)
want to profit or (105:41 - 105:48)
both yeah well they will (105:43 - 105:48)
profit the last thing I will say is for (105:49 - 105:58)
Fukuoka the actual event for wild area (105:55 - 106:02)
both nights in the park they ended with (105:58 - 106:06)
a toxcity raid gigantamax that you could (106:02 - 106:11)
join and it went up to 600 people and it (106:06 - 106:15)
worked and it was by far out of the (106:11 - 106:17)
eight years of this game one of like the (106:15 - 106:20)
top three moments in the game was to see (106:17 - 106:23)
600 people do a toxy raid now I saw saw (106:20 - 106:26)
somebody like tweet like oh my gosh The (106:23 - 106:28)
Raid (106:26 - 106:31)
scaled it it didn&#39;t they&#39;re they&#39;re just (106:28 - 106:34)
lying it did not scale um so I don&#39;t (106:31 - 106:36)
know why they thought that or maybe (106:34 - 106:39)
there was slight scaling like maybe it (106:36 - 106:41)
just had more HP than (106:39 - 106:45)
a uh like a normal one but like it (106:41 - 106:48)
definitely didn&#39;t scale uh to like 600 (106:45 - 106:51)
people uh now when you join a raid (106:48 - 106:55)
here&#39;s another tip you can see like if (106:51 - 106:57)
if 30 people join a raid that number in (106:55 - 106:59)
the corner should be (106:57 - 107:03)
90 and three per three three per three (106:59 - 107:04)
times three three times whatever the (107:03 - 107:08)
number is yeah so when 600 people join (107:04 - 107:12)
that number should be like 1,800 right (107:08 - 107:16)
and when the boss is preparing for a big (107:12 - 107:19)
attack that is usually when all of those (107:16 - 107:21)
Sables and wulus get one shot right and (107:19 - 107:23)
like the the the Venusaur and the (107:21 - 107:25)
Excadrill they they stay alive the (107:23 - 107:28)
Metagross is they stay alive so (107:25 - 107:34)
watching 1,800 people drop to 12200 (107:28 - 107:37)
people instantly was like (107:34 - 107:41)
oh this boss just knocked out almost (107:37 - 107:46)
everyone with one attack mhm mhm and (107:41 - 107:47)
part of the reason why I was like I (107:46 - 107:51)
don&#39;t think this is scaling is because (107:47 - 107:54)
we we did it relatively fast um um like (107:51 - 107:57)
we did it within one gmax cycle of of (107:54 - 108:00)
like okay after after the first gmax (107:57 - 108:04)
boss has like 40% HP or 35% HP and then (108:00 - 108:05)
we finish it off before the second gmax (108:04 - 108:09)
happens um but there (108:05 - 108:11)
was again I&#39;ve done a lot of raids I I (108:09 - 108:14)
did a raid in I don&#39;t even know where it (108:11 - 108:17)
was it was somewhere in ibukuro but like (108:14 - 108:19)
I was like on my way to the Pokemon (108:17 - 108:22)
Center and only only like 2930 people (108:19 - 108:24)
joined and I was like I don&#39;t know if (108:22 - 108:25)
we&#39;re going to do this cuzz like it&#39;s (108:24 - 108:27)
it&#39;s like really early in the morning (108:25 - 108:30)
and like not near the Pokemon Center at (108:27 - 108:31)
all so I was like I don&#39;t know who&#39;s out (108:30 - 108:33)
here in the middle of nowhere doing this (108:31 - 108:35)
like cuz I&#39;m like down some back alley (108:33 - 108:36)
like none of the stores are open or (108:35 - 108:38)
anything I&#39;m just like ah maybe I&#39;ll do (108:36 - 108:39)
this right along the (108:38 - 108:43)
way and I remember that 30 person raid (108:39 - 108:46)
because we beat toxcity in one gmax (108:43 - 108:48)
cycle and after the first gmax cycle it (108:46 - 108:51)
only had 20% HP left I don&#39;t know who (108:48 - 108:54)
was in that raid but they killed it they (108:51 - 108:57)
were so good like everyone in the raid (108:54 - 108:59)
was doing exactly what they needed to do (108:57 - 109:01)
to like completely knock it out so it&#39;s (108:59 - 109:05)
just funny to me that my 30 person raid (109:01 - 109:07)
at like 9 in the (109:05 - 109:11)
morning went faster than a 600 person (109:07 - 109:15)
raid in the park uh that&#39;s (109:11 - 109:17)
wild (109:15 - 109:20)
like I I again I that&#39;s why I&#39;m a little (109:17 - 109:22)
bit jaded with this mushroom thing (109:20 - 109:26)
because I just think if there&#39;s more (109:22 - 109:28)
education and there was like maybe a (109:26 - 109:30)
little bit more time in (109:28 - 109:33)
between and I think how Niantic started (109:30 - 109:35)
it with three different Pokemon at once (109:33 - 109:38)
I think there was just so many misses (109:35 - 109:40)
yes and I feel (109:38 - 109:44)
like this item can benefit some I don&#39;t (109:40 - 109:45)
want to disagree with you too I think (109:44 - 109:47)
there will be some people that can (109:45 - 109:50)
benefit from it but I think it will hurt (109:47 - 109:52)
more than it benefits I think there will (109:50 - 109:54)
be people who buy this item and feel (109:52 - 109:56)
burned by it or don&#39;t even have to buy (109:54 - 109:58)
it like you don&#39;t even have to buy it to (109:56 - 110:00)
be like this feels like a cash grab and (109:58 - 110:04)
this feels for sure 100% agree it does (110:00 - 110:07)
and to your point the starters the way (110:04 - 110:10)
that they did the first three that threw (110:07 - 110:12)
me off of wanting to do gigantamax raids (110:10 - 110:14)
I didn&#39;t do them that weekend but I saw (110:12 - 110:16)
everything that happened and I so I (110:14 - 110:18)
didn&#39;t do the Gengar ones I was like I (110:16 - 110:19)
don&#39;t want to do this it&#39;s not and I (110:18 - 110:21)
wouldn&#39;t have done the toxitricity I (110:19 - 110:23)
liter like I said at the beginning I did (110:21 - 110:25)
not go into that weekend wild area (110:23 - 110:27)
weekend with like the thought of doing a (110:25 - 110:30)
gmax toxcity raid but I was I just (110:27 - 110:31)
happened to be at a big park with a lot (110:30 - 110:34)
of people and there was one there and (110:31 - 110:36)
because you know you know there&#39;s no (110:34 - 110:38)
cost right like if you just walk up and (110:36 - 110:39)
you have their Max particles that you (110:38 - 110:41)
already collected for the day like I (110:39 - 110:43)
didn&#39;t spend any money to do this (110:41 - 110:45)
toxcity raid right and I knew if I lost (110:43 - 110:46)
I wasn&#39;t going to like you get your (110:45 - 110:48)
stuff back you get your stuff back so (110:46 - 110:49)
there was that like there wasn&#39;t as much (110:48 - 110:51)
pressure to like oh I have to go in here (110:49 - 110:53)
and I have to win or you know uh um and (110:51 - 110:56)
doing that and winning made me feel like (110:53 - 110:59)
oh this is this is actually kind of cool (110:56 - 111:01)
they really messed up the very first (110:59 - 111:03)
impression of this because it you know (111:01 - 111:06)
it was not a good first impression and (111:03 - 111:08)
there were mistakes made and to your (111:06 - 111:11)
point like Max mushrooms they&#39;re kind of (111:08 - 111:13)
expensive they&#39;re gonna it does you know (111:11 - 111:14)
people are going to be like this is a (111:13 - 111:15)
cash grab this isn&#39;t going to work this (111:14 - 111:18)
isn&#39;t going to benefit me um I agree I (111:15 - 111:21)
do agree but I do think (111:18 - 111:24)
like over time things will it will be (111:21 - 111:25)
different over time but you know I I do (111:24 - 111:27)
think like your point education would go (111:25 - 111:29)
a long way having some kind of like (111:27 - 111:31)
research that really made you like (111:29 - 111:33)
understand like okay now you have to hit (111:31 - 111:35)
like even a little tutorial like now you (111:33 - 111:37)
have to hit Max spirit and you can see (111:35 - 111:39)
how this works or you have to you know (111:37 - 111:41)
tap Max guard and see how the mechanic (111:39 - 111:44)
Works would definitely be helpful I just (111:41 - 111:46)
think that you could have that in (111:44 - 111:49)
addition to something like Max mushrooms (111:46 - 111:51)
I think I think both have a place and (111:49 - 111:53)
both can be in the game to together (111:51 - 111:56)
rather than one over the other yeah I (111:53 - 111:58)
mean I think rocket Radars are like the (111:56 - 111:59)
biggest scam in the world like I&#39;ve (111:58 - 112:01)
never purchased rocket (111:59 - 112:05)
Radars yeah but but like somebody out (112:01 - 112:07)
there loves (112:05 - 112:11)
them I actually am not convinced anyone (112:07 - 112:13)
does I think there are people who buy (112:11 - 112:16)
them I&#39;m not sure anyone actually enjoys (112:13 - 112:19)
them so many of them from Community Day (112:16 - 112:20)
I feel like the dollar Community Day (112:19 - 112:22)
things always give you like a rocket (112:20 - 112:24)
radar and so I always end up with like (112:22 - 112:25)
you know those those dollar Community (112:24 - 112:27)
Days don&#39;t even have like a story (112:25 - 112:29)
anymore do you remember they used to (112:27 - 112:31)
have like a story yeah I know they don&#39;t (112:29 - 112:34)
they they took that out now it&#39;s just (112:31 - 112:35)
probably because like no one read it I (112:34 - 112:37)
mean not surprising no one reads (112:35 - 112:38)
anything that&#39;s why that&#39;s why (112:37 - 112:40)
everyone&#39;s stories are pretty good the (112:38 - 112:41)
stories are like they&#39;re they&#39;re cute (112:40 - 112:43)
little stories like they&#39;re they&#39;re good (112:41 - 112:45)
if you follow along with them but they (112:43 - 112:47)
yeah I don&#39;t think anybody was reading (112:45 - 112:49)
them I wish it was possible to go back (112:47 - 112:51)
and and read the stories in your (112:49 - 112:54)
research history so that if you missed (112:51 - 112:55)
something you could just go back and (112:54 - 112:57)
click through it again that would be (112:55 - 112:59)
pretty cool I because they did try to (112:57 - 113:01)
have a story through line for a short (112:59 - 113:03)
time and I was really excited about that (113:01 - 113:05)
there was actually a coherent story (113:03 - 113:08)
between multiple I don&#39;t even know if (113:05 - 113:09)
this was before Seasons I think it was (113:08 - 113:12)
around the beginning of that but it was (113:09 - 113:14)
exciting and then they completely (113:12 - 113:17)
dropped it yeah well alola had a whole (113:14 - 113:18)
story line where because they switched (113:17 - 113:21)
out and then they had the ultra Recon (113:18 - 113:23)
yeah they&#39;re doing the long research in (113:21 - 113:25)
that way yeah yeah I think the person (113:23 - 113:26)
who wrote the community stories I just (113:25 - 113:28)
don&#39;t think they work there anymore yeah (113:26 - 113:30)
that also makes sense I don&#39;t think they (113:28 - 113:32)
got fired I think they just got a (113:30 - 113:33)
different (113:32 - 113:36)
job well that it is a bummer that the (113:33 - 113:37)
community day I know there was a bunch (113:36 - 113:41)
of layoffs for Niantic but um for my (113:37 - 113:43)
understanding there was it wasn&#39;t anyone (113:41 - 113:45)
on the Pokemon go team it was like the (113:43 - 113:48)
NBA stuff and the yeah other games that (113:45 - 113:51)
they the Transformer stuff it wasn&#39;t I (113:48 - 113:54)
don&#39;t I can&#39;t think of no I no I can&#39;t (113:51 - 113:56)
think like two yeah I can think of like (113:54 - 113:59)
two or three Los Angeles office stuff (113:56 - 114:01)
too which is not related as much in that (113:59 - 114:05)
the development way as as other things (114:01 - 114:08)
yeah also it&#39;s been like eight months (114:05 - 114:10)
since the new avatars and Niantic has (114:08 - 114:12)
not done anything to change them there (114:10 - 114:14)
were small changes they yeah they (114:12 - 114:17)
slightly changed things and (114:14 - 114:20)
didn&#39;t subtle changes to things but the (114:17 - 114:23)
real long con from Niantic (114:20 - 114:25)
if we just ignore (114:23 - 114:30)
it that is (114:25 - 114:30)
yeah um I&#39;ll I&#39;ll I&#39;ll buy I&#39;ll buy a (114:30 - 114:34)
Max mushroom when it comes out as (114:33 - 114:35)
somebody who (114:34 - 114:39)
does a lot of raids I I just I do want (114:35 - 114:41)
to see like because you guys you guys (114:39 - 114:44)
can be like Steve you you you&#39;re you&#39;re (114:41 - 114:45)
very privileged you get to do 40 person (114:44 - 114:49)
raids it&#39;s true very true so I would (114:45 - 114:53)
like to see if I feel like my 40 person (114:49 - 114:55)
raids are twice as fast cuz ideally they (114:53 - 114:58)
should be right for four bucks yeah so (114:55 - 115:01)
IDE yes IDE when they drop for Lapras I (114:58 - 115:04)
will try it one time and I will report (115:01 - 115:06)
back I don&#39;t think I&#39;m going to be happy (115:04 - 115:08)
with it ah yes the the results of a (115:06 - 115:11)
onetime try to well was it was it (115:08 - 115:13)
doesn&#39;t it stay on for like 30 minutes (115:11 - 115:15)
right I guess yeah I think that&#39;s what (115:13 - 115:18)
it does I hope it&#39;s not $4 for one raid (115:15 - 115:20)
is it 30 minutes is that what it is I (115:18 - 115:22)
thought it was just like a lucky egg or (115:20 - 115:25)
a incense I thought you turn my guess (115:22 - 115:26)
was that it was going to be for a single (115:25 - 115:28)
raid but I haven&#39;t actually looked into (115:26 - 115:30)
it (115:28 - 115:33)
um I&#39;ll I&#39;ll do it I&#39;ll do it for Lapras (115:30 - 115:34)
and I will let you know because the (115:33 - 115:37)
thing about like gosh I&#39;m such a yapper (115:34 - 115:41)
the thing about like uh raids and I (115:37 - 115:42)
talked about this for Blastoise is (115:41 - 115:44)
people will do or the Kanto starters is (115:42 - 115:46)
people will do like oh I got one of each (115:44 - 115:49)
I&#39;m done and then the group gets thinner (115:46 - 115:51)
and then people are like okay I&#39;m out of (115:49 - 115:53)
particles or I&#39;m out of raid p as I&#39;m (115:51 - 115:55)
done and the group gets thinner M so (115:53 - 115:57)
ideally the people who are left over are (115:55 - 116:00)
like the most hardcore people mhm cuz I (115:57 - 116:04)
want to keep going right um so not that (116:00 - 116:06)
I want to give Niantic money but I&#39;ll (116:04 - 116:09)
try it well you also do so there is also (116:06 - 116:11)
an event ticket for this uh for this (116:09 - 116:14)

more frequently (117:21 - 117:24)
so I&#39;m guessing we&#39;ll have those like 20 (117:23 - 117:27)
or 30 minute yeah probably 30 minutes (117:24 - 117:30)
and then you&#39;ll get eight times the max (117:27 - 117:33)
particles from Power spots so what do (117:30 - 117:35)
you usually (117:33 - 117:39)
get 120 from a power spot so you&#39;d get I (117:35 - 117:41)
don&#39;t want to do the math whatever that (117:39 - 117:43)
is he said eight times eight times so (117:41 - 117:44)
that would be probably just like a flat (117:43 - 117:46)
800 (117:44 - 117:48)
960 (117:46 - 117:51)
yeah but Lapras will be 800 so (117:48 - 117:54)
ultimately you&#39;re paying $5 to do yeah (117:51 - 117:55)
what (117:54 - 117:58)
like six Lapras assuming you started the (117:55 - 118:01)
day with zero (117:58 - 118:01)
particles some of those were the free (118:02 - 118:06)
bonuses (118:04 - 118:06)
though yeah which I am liking seeing (118:06 - 118:11)
them move more in the direction of a (118:09 - 118:12)
raid day where they&#39;re giving people (118:11 - 118:13)
free raid passes they&#39;re providing (118:12 - 118:16)
people more free more free MAX particles (118:13 - 118:18)
and I think that&#39;s a very good thing (118:16 - 118:21)
yeah yeah yeah okay yeah so I agree and (118:18 - 118:23)
last thing if you go go to the web store (118:21 - 118:25)
cuz you know they always want you to (118:23 - 118:26)
like leave the app and like go to the (118:25 - 118:29)
web store to buy things rather than (118:26 - 118:30)
through the app there is a double (118:29 - 118:34)
feature ticket box so for $7 you&#39;ll get (118:30 - 118:36)
the gigantamax (118:34 - 118:39)
Lapras ticket and you get the uh uh (118:36 - 118:42)
aspiring dragons research day ticket (118:39 - 118:45)
together for $7 from the web store so (118:42 - 118:46)
I&#39;m sure that&#39;ll be a little bit cheaper (118:45 - 118:48)
than if you bought them separately if (118:46 - 118:49)
you&#39;re going to buy (118:48 - 118:52)
both go to niantic&#39;s web store because (118:49 - 118:55)
they they love when you do (118:52 - 118:58)
that and uh 10% Kickback goes to Bobby (118:55 - 119:00)
if you do that so (118:58 - 119:04)
just no no no all right uh let&#39;s take a (119:00 - 119:06)
quick break and then uh we&#39;ll we&#39;ll do (119:04 - 119:08)
the scarlet and violet schedule for the (119:06 - 119:11)
rest of the year we will be right (119:08 - 119:14)
back and we are back from our (119:11 - 119:17)
break I&#39;m pretty sure Shin I&#39;m pretty (119:14 - 119:18)
sure we talked about Shiny Rayquaza (119:17 - 119:21)
right it&#39;s been two weeks yes we we (119:18 - 119:23)
talked about it (119:21 - 119:26)
it wasn&#39;t announced the way they wanted (119:23 - 119:28)
it to be announced oh yes yes it was (119:26 - 119:30)
announced via (119:28 - 119:34)
the store of some kind yes it was like (119:30 - 119:36)
early in the store cuz I I got the flyer (119:34 - 119:40)
that was um I they when I went to every (119:36 - 119:42)
Pokemon Center they put that flyer that (119:40 - 119:44)
then was released early in every one of (119:42 - 119:46)
my bags which is the like mythical (119:44 - 119:50)
distribution for Deoxys CIO and cude for (119:46 - 119:53)
the points um (119:50 - 119:54)
and then it was the flyer for the (119:53 - 119:58)
Rayquaza it was like all all in um yeah (119:54 - 120:01)
so we have details now uh Shiny Rayquaza (119:58 - 120:05)
will appear in uh five star raids from (120:01 - 120:08)
December 20th which the dates were right (120:05 - 120:12)

type Tera uh you can you can catch one (120:12 - 120:19)
like you can always catch one um five (120:16 - 120:22)
star raids are level 75 I&#39;ll put a (120:19 - 120:24)
little there (120:22 - 120:27)
because maybe they Chang things for this (120:24 - 120:30)
but like walking wake uh Diga Pia those (120:27 - 120:32)
were five star raid all five star raids (120:30 - 120:35)
are level 75 so ideally should be level (120:32 - 120:38)
75 they are doing other events leading (120:35 - 120:41)
up to it so there will be during the (120:38 - 120:44)

outbreaks not to be confused with the (121:36 - 121:40)
satadal fracture carbank I just talked (121:37 - 121:42)
about because those will be during (121:40 - 121:45)
Rayquaza specifically but as we&#39;re (121:42 - 121:48)
recording this Tinka Tink uh with the (121:45 - 121:51)
Ferocious Mark will appear until (121:48 - 121:55)

then giraffa rig in the blueberry (122:02 - 122:06)

appear in mass outbreaks throughout the (122:12 - 122:17)
Pala region and that will be from Friday (122:13 - 122:20)
November 29th to January 5th just chansy (122:17 - 122:22)
in Pala if you want to (122:20 - 122:25)
knock a bunch of those out for either (122:22 - 122:27)
the candy or the not the candy the the (122:25 - 122:30)
materials the experience that kind of (122:27 - 122:32)
stuff um and that will take us to the (122:30 - 122:36)
start of the year so Mass outbreak every (122:32 - 122:40)
week five star raids every week and then (122:36 - 122:41)
that will eventually get us to Rayquaza (122:40 - 122:44)
which is a five-star raid unfortunately (122:41 - 122:48)
not a sevenstar raid um I wanted it to (122:44 - 122:50)
be a seven star raid because I I just (122:48 - 122:54)
liked the Mewtwo I I like the (122:50 - 122:57)
challenge as we just had an hour talking (122:54 - 122:59)
about gmax raids in Pokemon go not (122:57 - 123:03)
Everyone likes a challenge you (122:59 - 123:03)
know (123:05 - 123:09)
um (123:07 - 123:14)
but that&#39;s that&#39;s fine like I I wonder (123:09 - 123:16)
if (123:14 - 123:19)
um I wonder if they (123:16 - 123:23)
saw how many people struggled with MW to (123:19 - 123:26)
mhm and they were like well we want (123:23 - 123:32)
people to get this mhm yeah yeah (123:26 - 123:32)
yep and (123:32 - 123:39)
that&#39;s M maybe why uh or maybe it was (123:34 - 123:41)
always planned to be a a five star but (123:39 - 123:45)
uh the I guess like the the actual (123:41 - 123:48)
bummer is just not the mighty (123:45 - 123:52)
Mark yeah right (123:48 - 123:55)
so it&#39;s like I don&#39;t know how much (123:52 - 123:57)
harder it would be if you take its level (123:55 - 124:00)
from 75 to (123:57 - 124:03)
100 but then you&#39;re just like I I just (124:00 - 124:05)
want the mighty Mark like Rayquaza with (124:03 - 124:07)
a mighty Mark Shiny Rayquaza with a (124:05 - 124:09)
mighty Mark just seems really rad it (124:07 - 124:11)
could have some sort of Mark to (124:09 - 124:14)
celebrate the anime or something uh that (124:11 - 124:16)
hasn&#39;t been said although I feel like (124:14 - 124:18)
they they have always they&#39;ve never like (124:16 - 124:20)
surprised us with a (124:18 - 124:24)
mark this point sure yeah (124:20 - 124:27)
yeah do do we think we&#39;ll get any other (124:24 - 124:29)
information about it prior to it or is (124:27 - 124:30)
this it like this is what we&#39;re getting (124:29 - 124:32)
for Shiny (124:30 - 124:35)
Rayquaza no more info to come I mean in (124:32 - 124:36)
the past kind of seems like the info (124:35 - 124:39)
dump yeah yeah yeah so that this was (124:36 - 124:42)
this also kind of seems like the grand (124:39 - 124:45)
finale potentially (124:42 - 124:45)
epilog just what what do we think do we (124:46 - 124:50)
think they&#39;re going to be doing more (124:49 - 124:54)
raids after this (124:50 - 124:54)
um I think they I think there&#39;s (124:54 - 125:00)
definitely an opportunity to repeat (124:57 - 125:02)
walking wake and iron leaves because (125:00 - 125:04)
people are going to get the game for (125:02 - 125:07)
Christmas yeah um and so repeat that I (125:04 - 125:10)
do still suspect there will (125:07 - 125:16)
be uh a gorging fire gouging fire sorry (125:10 - 125:20)
uh I love to Gorge uh gorging fire and (125:16 - 125:22)
raging bolt like I do think those would (125:20 - 125:23)
come to (125:22 - 125:26)
raids as (125:23 - 125:27)
well (125:26 - 125:29)
um I don&#39;t think they&#39;re done with raids (125:27 - 125:31)
I still think there&#39;s an (125:29 - 125:33)
opportunity (125:31 - 125:36)
for because we we don&#39;t have double (125:33 - 125:40)
legendaries yet for VGC uh when January (125:36 - 125:42)
comes we&#39;ll go to regulation G which is (125:40 - 125:44)
one legendary restricted (125:42 - 125:48)
allowed um so I I I have (125:44 - 125:51)
hope that the forces of nature (125:48 - 125:53)
specifically with anamoros comes to (125:51 - 125:56)
raids just like Diga and (125:53 - 126:00)
Pia uh and they do they do that uh I can (125:56 - 126:02)
definitely see them repeating raids (126:00 - 126:04)
right like we&#39;ve gotten Charizard twice (126:02 - 126:05)
we&#39;ve gotten Pikachu twice I actually (126:04 - 126:07)
really surprised there was no Eevee for (126:05 - 126:09)
Eevee week they kind of like didn&#39;t do (126:07 - 126:11)
anything for eeve week at all in scarlet (126:09 - 126:14)
and violet yeah like last year it was (126:11 - 126:17)
like Pokemon go and I think Masters and (126:14 - 126:20)
unite like I don&#39;t think unite did (126:17 - 126:22)
anything I think they did I think they (126:20 - 126:25)
gave eeve Lucian passes to people is (126:22 - 126:29)
what I saw but Master definitely did (126:25 - 126:31)
they made a bigger of it last year yeah (126:29 - 126:33)
it was bigger last year but I think that (126:31 - 126:36)
was mostly scarlet and violet this year (126:33 - 126:39)
Masters definitely did and sleep (126:36 - 126:42)
definitely did and I think unite did as (126:39 - 126:44)
well (126:42 - 126:48)
um yeah I (126:44 - 126:51)
I I don&#39;t think they&#39;re done done like (126:48 - 126:53)
they has to be a Pokemon day thing as (126:51 - 126:56)
well right even when Scarlet Violet were (126:53 - 127:00)
out there was still karx not karx glri (126:56 - 127:02)
and Spector in sword and (127:00 - 127:04)
shield (127:02 - 127:07)
while Scarlet Violet was (127:04 - 127:11)
out like they still kind of ran raids to (127:07 - 127:12)
the very end of that (127:11 - 127:15)
game even after the fact when everyone (127:12 - 127:16)
was done they were like here&#39;s a random (127:15 - 127:18)
U raid you&#39;re like I can&#39;t catch these (127:16 - 127:23)
but like I sure I guess I&#39;ll do U (127:18 - 127:23)
so I yeah I I don&#39;t think they&#39;re done (127:23 - 127:26)
with raids I think this is a really good (127:25 - 127:29)
way to end the year though but like uh (127:26 - 127:31)
that kind of lines up with the anime so (127:29 - 127:33)
timing wise it&#39;s what I&#39;ve always (127:31 - 127:35)
suspected that they would put Shiny (127:33 - 127:38)
Rayquaza pretty close to the Japanese (127:35 - 127:41)
anime CU boy we&#39;re still far behind in (127:38 - 127:43)
the (127:41 - 127:43)
American yeah we at least have the (127:43 - 127:49)
release date for the next season yeah (127:46 - 127:52)
yeah um I&#39;ll still put like counters out (127:49 - 127:57)
on YouTube I I think I think even though (127:52 - 128:01)
it&#39;s level 75 just it&#39;s funny because we (127:57 - 128:02)
just had a conversation about people (128:01 - 128:05)
struggling in Pokemon go with raids but (128:02 - 128:07)
we I I personally saw a lot of people (128:05 - 128:08)
struggle with the alga and Pia I saw (128:07 - 128:10)
people struggle with walking wake and (128:08 - 128:12)
iron leaves even though those were level (128:10 - 128:17)
75 um Rayquaza will have dragon ACC (128:12 - 128:22)
Ascent Ascent accent Ascent to ascend (128:17 - 128:25)
yes um which is not a dragon type move (128:22 - 128:29)
it is a flying type move and it&#39;s very (128:25 - 128:31)
strong and even though fairy would be (128:29 - 128:33)
very good against Rayquaza because it&#39;s (128:31 - 128:35)
a dragon type and Fairy doesn&#39;t get hit (128:33 - 128:38)
by Dragon uh a lot of fairies are not (128:35 - 128:43)
resistant to a flying type stab move (128:38 - 128:44)
especially when Rayquaza can learn (128:43 - 128:46)
Swords Dance it can learn bulk up it can (128:44 - 128:48)
learn Dragon Dance I think it can learn (128:46 - 128:50)
bulk up uh dragon dance and sword (128:48 - 128:54)
dancece though so uh I think there will (128:50 - 128:57)
still be somewhat of a challenge uh (128:54 - 128:59)
although again probably not nearly as (128:57 - 129:02)
hard as meww so I&#39;ll I&#39;ll make a bunch (128:59 - 129:03)
of counters that should be up on YouTube (129:02 - 129:07)
uh probably within this week for that I (129:03 - 129:11)
do want to point out and we&#39;ll probably (129:07 - 129:13)
talk about this in the future because (129:11 - 129:15)
Pokemon put out a bunch of (129:13 - 129:18)
like here&#39;s everything after two years (129:15 - 129:22)
like most caught most used on a team uh (129:18 - 129:24)
favorite gym leaders and stuff the one I (129:22 - 129:26)
want to just focus on for today&#39;s (129:24 - 129:27)
episode because we&#39;re really running (129:26 - 129:30)
along is long is the Terra Pokemon most (129:27 - 129:32)
challenged in raid battles and so the (129:30 - 129:35)
top five which I think are really (129:32 - 129:40)
interesting is Charizard ditto Eevee (129:35 - 129:42)
blissy and (129:40 - 129:47)
cinderace now three of those were seven (129:42 - 129:50)
star raids but Eevee kind of gets a (129:47 - 129:53)
weird pass cuz it was the first week of (129:50 - 129:55)
the game where they put Eevee in every (129:53 - 129:58)
raid yeah with every terot type right so (129:55 - 130:01)
you were like I remember that trying to (129:58 - 130:03)
collect every one of the so if you (130:01 - 130:06)
remove Eevee from the equation you only (130:03 - 130:09)
have Charizard and cinderace which are (130:06 - 130:12)
the most rated Pokemon the first two (130:09 - 130:15)
Seven (130:12 - 130:19)
Stars which to me is shocking because (130:15 - 130:23)
Mewtwo ran for over over a (130:19 - 130:26)
month like Charizard did have two cycles (130:23 - 130:30)
right or well two weeks but like four (130:26 - 130:33)
weeks total to like two full Cycles (130:30 - 130:36)
cinderace was only around for two weeks (130:33 - 130:39)
and it was top five Mewtwo was around (130:36 - 130:42)
for a month plus and you got a Mew to (130:39 - 130:48)
counter it mhm and it was not most (130:42 - 130:51)
rated do you remember what month like (130:48 - 130:55)
what month that was Mewtwo was August (130:51 - 130:58)
of of not this last year uh not this (130:55 - 131:00)
year but last year right it was like (130:58 - 131:04)
August into September where Cinder was (131:00 - 131:05)
like January (131:04 - 131:08)
is cuz like Char cind was after (131:05 - 131:10)
Charizard and Charizard was (131:08 - 131:13)
December but like like obviously more (131:10 - 131:16)
people playing when the game first comes (131:13 - 131:22)
out yeah well also August of 2023 (131:16 - 131:26)
yes for Mewtwo okay was that so one DLC (131:22 - 131:28)
was out already which was when did Zelda (131:26 - 131:32)
come out oh you think this a Zelda thing (131:28 - 131:34)
no I I I really I genuinely think it was (131:32 - 131:35)
because Mewtwo was too (131:34 - 131:37)
hard okay I was thinking just because (131:35 - 131:40)
people busy playing another really (131:37 - 131:42)
really big game a couple months after it (131:40 - 131:43)
came out might have just attracted (131:42 - 131:44)
people (131:43 - 131:47)
from playing these (131:44 - 131:50)
raids I I like Greninja the kingdom came (131:47 - 131:52)
out in May (131:50 - 131:53)
yeah no I don&#39;t think it was a Zelda (131:52 - 131:56)
thing I think could have been a (131:53 - 131:58)
[Laughter] (131:56 - 132:00)
factor did you you you have Eevee (131:58 - 132:02)
Charizard Cinder Ras which are like the (132:00 - 132:05)
first three promoted raids in the game (132:02 - 132:07)
for (132:05 - 132:11)
sureh um Greninja was after Cinder race (132:07 - 132:14)
was the third one and Greninja way more (132:11 - 132:15)
popular than Cinder race not saying (132:14 - 132:18)
Cinder Ras isn&#39;t a popular Pokemon but (132:15 - 132:21)
Greninja would probably beat Charizard (132:18 - 132:23)
in a lot of contest at least in Japan (132:21 - 132:25)
but like Greninja I&#39;m what I&#39;m saying is (132:23 - 132:27)
Greninja is incredibly popular like (132:25 - 132:30)
busted popular (132:27 - 132:32)
yeah uh and Greninja didn&#39;t even make (132:30 - 132:34)
the list (132:32 - 132:38)
so just speculation I feel like they (132:34 - 132:41)
probably saw Mewtwo had so much more (132:38 - 132:43)
time than these other raids didn&#39;t even (132:41 - 132:46)
make the top five difficulty for sure a (132:43 - 132:52)
factor um and like (132:46 - 132:52)
just (132:53 - 132:57)
really Mewtwo set up like I I love the (132:55 - 132:59)
Mewtwo raid don&#39;t get me wrong I think I (132:57 - 133:00)
think there are people listening to the (132:59 - 133:02)
podcast that love the Mewtwo raid I (133:00 - 133:03)
think there were people (133:02 - 133:06)
that were very glad they got it done had (133:03 - 133:09)
no desire to do it again (133:06 - 133:12)
um but I I thought the Mewtwo raid was (133:09 - 133:14)
was a really fun puzzle to figure out I (133:12 - 133:16)
loved helping people go through it but (133:14 - 133:19)
like I like red content so like when I (133:16 - 133:22)
played Destiny for 3 years straight I&#39;d (133:19 - 133:24)
be like I already have these rewards I (133:22 - 133:26)
don&#39;t even need to do this raid but I (133:24 - 133:28)
did the raid cuz like my enjoyment was (133:26 - 133:31)
like helping other people get through it (133:28 - 133:33)
and being like Oh I did it like thank (133:31 - 133:35)
you so much for helping me and that was (133:33 - 133:37)
like that was like my dose of Serotonin (133:35 - 133:39)
I was like yeah like little Jimmy over (133:37 - 133:40)
here got (133:39 - 133:42)
through and that&#39;s why I would buy the (133:40 - 133:45)
max mushroom because I also like helping (133:42 - 133:48)
people get through raids now I&#39;ll (133:45 - 133:48)
stop I&#39;m going to raid with hand on more (133:49 - 133:54)
often just so I get the benefit of her (133:51 - 133:56)
buying the mushroom for me no cuz we (133:54 - 134:00)
would win even without that that&#39;s true (133:56 - 134:03)
um but I I I do I do kind of think like (134:00 - 134:05)
maybe this was supposed to be like seven (134:03 - 134:07)
star Mighty Rayquaza and then they (134:05 - 134:09)
looked at these numbers and we&#39;re like (134:07 - 134:11)
maybe we want people to like actually (134:09 - 134:14)
complete this and like feel good and (134:11 - 134:16)
like go (134:14 - 134:19)
through uh and that&#39;s fine like I would (134:16 - 134:22)
as I I&#39;m selfish I want a Mark Rayquaza (134:19 - 134:23)
I think that would be very cool uh (134:22 - 134:27)
that&#39;s what I hop for but like it if (134:23 - 134:30)
more people can do the Rayquaza that&#39;s (134:27 - 134:31)
that&#39;s (134:30 - 134:33)
good like people should be able to jump (134:31 - 134:34)
in (134:33 - 134:38)
and ideally find a team and and if they (134:34 - 134:41)
can&#39;t ideally hopefully you know have an (134:38 - 134:43)
Arcanine and a star Raptor stand next to (134:41 - 134:45)
them so they can intimidate spam and be (134:43 - 134:48)
able to get the raid done hopefully it (134:45 - 134:50)
being five star instead of instead of (134:48 - 134:51)
seven star will actually bring more (134:50 - 134:54)
people back too yeah right right right (134:51 - 135:00)
right right right um so you also you (134:54 - 135:03)
also have it being five star gives (135:00 - 135:06)
people who haven&#39;t beaten the game the (135:03 - 135:08)
opportunity to to get it as well in (135:06 - 135:11)
their own without having to do something (135:08 - 135:14)
online right is that true or would they (135:11 - 135:17)
still have to five stars don&#39;t appear (135:14 - 135:22)
until at least you beat the academy (135:17 - 135:25)
oh okay and then six stars would be when (135:22 - 135:27)
you do (135:25 - 135:31)
credits a couple of five stars wait yeah (135:27 - 135:32)
I don&#39;t think five stars appear at all (135:31 - 135:34)
until at least you have all eight gem (135:32 - 135:36)
badges or something like that okay got (135:34 - 135:38)
it got it cuz you because the game (135:36 - 135:40)
scales in the at least the sense of like (135:38 - 135:42)
you&#39;ll only see one or two stars and (135:40 - 135:43)
then when you get farther you&#39;ll start (135:42 - 135:44)
seeing (135:43 - 135:47)
three obviously you could be like no gym (135:44 - 135:50)
badges enjoying somebody&#39;s five star or (135:47 - 135:52)
seven star yeah that that still works as (135:50 - 135:55)
long as you have a (135:52 - 135:55)
code but there there there is a point in (135:56 - 136:01)
the game where like five five stars are (135:58 - 136:04)
unlocked and then unlocked once you meet (136:01 - 136:06)
Ed Sharon and (136:04 - 136:08)
then finish the game&#39;s three story lines (136:06 - 136:10)
as well as the way home story line to (136:08 - 136:12)
get the five it&#39;s been so long that&#39;s (136:10 - 136:14)
why I looked it up once you unlock it (136:12 - 136:16)
it&#39;s like it&#39;s just (136:14 - 136:19)
there let me tell you when you put like (136:16 - 136:21)
600 hours into Pokemon and then you&#39;re (136:19 - 136:23)
like start and you&#39;re like wow none of (136:21 - 136:26)
the I take everything for granted you (136:23 - 136:26)
can&#39;t (136:26 - 136:30)
[Laughter] (136:26 - 136:30)
fly (136:31 - 136:34)
uh yeah a lot of a lot of scarlet and (136:32 - 136:37)
violet stuff for that um and (136:34 - 136:40)
then pocket I wanted to spend more time (136:37 - 136:42)
on pocket but we did have two very heavy (136:40 - 136:45)
Pocket episodes but uh reading the (136:42 - 136:47)
comments over the last two weeks people (136:45 - 136:48)
like the pocket talk so that&#39;s good cuz (136:47 - 136:50)
I like talking about pocket uh there&#39;s a (136:48 - 136:52)
current event happening right now (136:50 - 136:55)
literally it started last night where if (136:52 - 136:58)
you have the premium pass Hannah I think (136:55 - 137:01)
yours expired are you still (136:58 - 137:04)
good I am (137:01 - 137:04)
considering because it seems like these (137:06 - 137:11)
roll over every two months I&#39;m (137:08 - 137:12)
considering buying the premium pass (137:11 - 137:15)
every other month ah I saw people talk (137:12 - 137:16)
about that (137:15 - 137:21)
yeah so premium pass just updated where (137:16 - 137:23)
there&#39;s like a Pikachu coin a Pikachu (137:21 - 137:26)
playmat uh (137:23 - 137:26)
Mewtwo I bought everything for (137:27 - 137:33)
Mew uh when it came out where it&#39;s like (137:30 - 137:34)
if you complete all the premium you get (137:33 - 137:36)
exactly enough currency to buy (137:34 - 137:39)
everything M and it seems the same (137:36 - 137:43)
here where like like you you do all the (137:39 - 137:44)
tasks you&#39;ll have enough to get the (137:43 - 137:46)
Mewtwo card the Pikachu play at the (137:44 - 137:48)
Pikachu coin I wonder if there&#39;s ever a (137:46 - 137:52)
reason to like not buy something (137:48 - 137:53)
so what I mean is like I don&#39;t care (137:52 - 137:56)
about the binder so if I don&#39;t buy the (137:53 - 137:58)
binder I&#39;ll have that currency for the (137:56 - 138:02)
next premium it looks like if you get (137:58 - 138:05)
behind like if you miss out on one of (138:02 - 138:08)
them because the Mewtwo stuff is all (138:05 - 138:10)
still available so if you were only (138:08 - 138:12)
starting to play the game now oh you (138:10 - 138:14)
would have to make some decisions but (138:12 - 138:16)
because of all all of us have been (138:14 - 138:18)
playing since day one I see I see what (138:16 - 138:19)
you&#39;re saying cuz I&#39;m just like I just (138:18 - 138:21)
don&#39;t really care about the binder stuff (138:19 - 138:23)
right now it&#39;s like maybe I don&#39;t need (138:21 - 138:25)
to buy it because I&#39;m never going to (138:23 - 138:27)
like use it you will when it&#39;s (138:25 - 138:30)
unavailable one (138:27 - 138:30)
day um so that event is happening right (138:32 - 138:36)
now and then the second promo event is (138:34 - 138:40)
happening right now with the (138:36 - 138:43)
Venusaur um new drop event so that is (138:40 - 138:45)
the Venusaur the Greninja the Haunter (138:43 - 138:48)
the Jigglypuff and the Onyx and this is (138:45 - 138:50)
the Jigglypuff we were talking about two (138:48 - 138:53)
weeks ago the really good Jigglypuff um (138:50 - 138:55)
that you would want to put in your deck (138:53 - 138:57)
for Wigglytuff to make the wiggly tough (138:55 - 139:00)
stuff a little stronger uh I don&#39;t think (138:57 - 139:02)
that moves like Wigglytuff into like an (139:00 - 139:04)
S tier deck I think your two s tier (139:02 - 139:10)
decks are still consistently Pikachu and (139:04 - 139:10)
Mewtwo but um there&#39;s five promo cards I (139:11 - 139:17)
think somebody did like the the (139:14 - 139:20)
the percentage distribution where like (139:17 - 139:23)
this Venus seems a little bit easier to (139:20 - 139:24)
get than the (139:23 - 139:27)
Lapras makes sense since it&#39;s not an (139:24 - 139:29)
it&#39;s just a Venusaur it&#39;s not a Venusaur (139:27 - 139:32)
EX yeah yeah um it is a beautiful (139:29 - 139:37)
looking card but uh it&#39;s not an EX (139:32 - 139:41)
card yeah (139:37 - 139:42)
um so (139:41 - 139:45)
I I have I have a small rant but before (139:42 - 139:47)
I get there uh are you guys still (139:45 - 139:48)
playing pocket are you still enjoying it (139:47 - 139:52)
Bobby how much money have you put in (139:48 - 139:54)
uh I have not been putting in nearly as (139:52 - 139:57)
much money since uh I&#39;ve gotten I got (139:54 - 139:59)
through I got through a lot of the stuff (139:57 - 140:01)
I&#39;m about six cards short of like the (139:59 - 140:04)
full genetic Apex set minus the secret (140:01 - 140:05)
rares I have a bunch of the secret rares (140:04 - 140:07)
I still have to get but about six cards (140:05 - 140:10)
short of the the regular like original (140:07 - 140:14)
226 cards of the Set uh and you know (140:10 - 140:16)
played through the PVP the last PVP (140:14 - 140:18)
event you know that ended just a few (140:16 - 140:22)
days ago um got through my wins and then (140:18 - 140:24)
definitely didn&#39;t play as much of the (140:22 - 140:29)
PVP after that just because that event (140:24 - 140:30)
wasn&#39;t going on but definitely still (140:29 - 140:32)
like trying out different decks having a (140:30 - 140:33)
lot of fun just trying different stuff (140:32 - 140:36)
out um I do like we talked about before (140:33 - 140:38)
I still really appreciate that there&#39;s (140:36 - 140:40)
not like a win loss record so you can (140:38 - 140:42)
kind of try a bunch of stuff out and if (140:40 - 140:43)
you take some losses it&#39;s not like I (140:42 - 140:45)
have to be like Oh I&#39;m racking up a (140:43 - 140:46)
bunch of losses right now while trying a (140:45 - 140:50)
bunch of stuff out uh so that&#39;s been fun (140:46 - 140:51)
and yeah I was glad GL to see this (140:50 - 140:54)
Venusaur event come through cuz it&#39;s (140:51 - 140:57)
nice to have another solo event to do (140:54 - 140:58)
and fun (140:57 - 141:01)
to um yeah fun to play with different (140:58 - 141:03)
decks um although I&#39;ve just been using (141:01 - 141:06)
like ninet Tales Rapidash a lot now and (141:03 - 141:07)
it&#39;s really fun to play with the (141:06 - 141:09)
majority of what people are using yeah (141:07 - 141:11)
and Ninetails is so fun to play with (141:09 - 141:15)
because it is you can set it up quick (141:11 - 141:17)
two energy to do 990 damage and then you (141:15 - 141:19)
throw those Blaine cards on top that do (141:17 - 141:22)
30 damage more M very fun very fun deck (141:19 - 141:25)
to play so I am definitely still (141:22 - 141:28)
enjoying it uh was defin was more on the (141:25 - 141:31)
just opening packs for a little while um (141:28 - 141:35)
between events but jumping more into (141:31 - 141:38)
battling again yeah all around love it (141:35 - 141:40)
and not gonna stop playing it anytime (141:38 - 141:43)
soon so it&#39;s (141:40 - 141:47)
great Hannah is now Max mushroom Queen (141:43 - 141:52)
and uh possible premium pass give (141:47 - 141:55)
don&#39;t like that um don&#39;t like any of (141:52 - 141:59)
that um haven&#39;t bought any of it yet I (141:55 - 142:02)
did do the premium pass trial uh it was (141:59 - 142:04)
fine I don&#39;t actually it ended I don&#39;t (142:02 - 142:06)
feel like I am getting significantly (142:04 - 142:10)
less without it but I do like the the (142:06 - 142:11)
extra items you can get the extra (142:10 - 142:13)
accessories you can get so maybe I&#39;ll (142:11 - 142:15)
start to get it for at least a couple of (142:13 - 142:17)
months and see how that goes and then (142:15 - 142:18)
maybe I&#39;ll just decide to only get the (142:17 - 142:21)
premium pass when I like the accessories (142:18 - 142:24)
mhm but the game itself I mentioned (142:21 - 142:26)
earlier I think I&#39;ve been opening it (142:24 - 142:28)
more than any of the other Pokemon (142:26 - 142:31)
mobile games recently I really enjoy it (142:28 - 142:35)
I didn&#39;t get the 50 wins in the PVP I (142:31 - 142:37)
didn&#39;t quite lean into that but I got (142:35 - 142:41)
the uh 25 I think I got 32 altogether oh (142:37 - 142:43)
nice I have a deck that I think is (142:41 - 142:45)
unique and fun and I really enjoy (142:43 - 142:49)
playing um and I was kind of starting to (142:45 - 142:51)
feel the event stuff slow down and then (142:49 - 142:53)
they brought the Venusaur event in so (142:51 - 142:55)
really feeling good about where it&#39;s at (142:53 - 142:57)
there were supposed to be the what they (142:55 - 142:59)
said they came out and then they said (142:57 - 143:00)
there was like the special set coming (142:59 - 143:03)
out in December mhm so I don&#39;t think we (143:00 - 143:06)
have an exact date for (143:03 - 143:09)
that um but cool of them to say come out (143:06 - 143:10)
and say that though that was nice of (143:09 - 143:12)
them to come out and yeah say hey we (143:10 - 143:13)
have stuff (143:12 - 143:16)
coming new set news hat (143:13 - 143:18)
coming (143:16 - 143:21)
uh there there there&#39;s two things I want (143:18 - 143:22)
to talk about and I hopefully that (143:21 - 143:24)
doesn&#39;t take too much time I think (143:22 - 143:27)
they&#39;re similar things and I don&#39;t know (143:24 - 143:30)
why this conversation keeps happening I (143:27 - 143:33)
I don&#39;t uh it&#39;s the it&#39;s the Pay to Win (143:30 - 143:35)
conversation and it is the whale (143:33 - 143:37)
conversation cuz I guess technically we (143:35 - 143:39)
had an episode that was pay to win and (143:37 - 143:41)
then we had an episode that was uh a (143:39 - 143:45)
whale episode um and there were a couple (143:41 - 143:46)
comments like I I try to read all the (143:45 - 143:49)
comments um I shadowban a couple people (143:46 - 143:53)
every every episode It&#39;s been great but (143:49 - 143:56)
um the the thing I don&#39;t get is the (143:53 - 143:59)
people like trying to justify that you (143:56 - 144:02)
can&#39;t whale in this game or you can&#39;t (143:59 - 144:04)
pay to win in this game uh cuz maybe (144:02 - 144:06)
they have their own like definitions of (144:04 - 144:09)
that uh which I don&#39;t fully understand (144:06 - 144:12)
so a really good example is like I was (144:09 - 144:14)
talking about how the game was paid to (144:12 - 144:15)
win on my stream I think we&#39;ve talked (144:14 - 144:17)
about how it&#39;s pay to win here and I (144:15 - 144:19)
think everyone agrees that it is pay to (144:17 - 144:22)
win it&#39;s fine cuz it&#39;s no different than (144:19 - 144:24)
Yu-Gi-Oh Magic the Gathering any little (144:22 - 144:28)
Trading Card gamecg P to (144:24 - 144:31)
win uh that&#39;s not to say so first (144:28 - 144:35)
clarification is sometimes there is (144:31 - 144:38)
Decks that are very good that are (144:35 - 144:42)
incredibly cheap uh that is a real thing (144:38 - 144:45)
uh and then sometimes the deck that is (144:42 - 144:48)
really good is just expensive um and the (144:45 - 144:50)
one I always bring up is the one that I (144:48 - 144:54)
I considered buying for a big tournament (144:50 - 144:56)
which was Mewtwo EX dark cry ex it was (144:54 - 144:59)
for Mewtwo EX for dark cry ex that was (144:56 - 145:00)
the deck that W won the national (144:59 - 145:02)
tournament I think it ended up winning (145:00 - 145:07)
worlds that year too uh but it was $80 (145:02 - 145:09)
for each Mewtwo you needed four it was (145:07 - 145:11)
$80 for each dark cry you needed four (145:09 - 145:14)
and those the the the worst part about (145:11 - 145:16)
me explaining that is both of those (145:14 - 145:19)
cards ended up in collector tins 2 (145:16 - 145:23)
months afterwards for $15 each so it&#39;s (145:19 - 145:26)
not even like I&#39;m spending $80 and these (145:23 - 145:27)
are the cards I&#39;m going to be using for (145:26 - 145:29)
the next 6 months it was I&#39;m spending (145:27 - 145:31)
$80 and they&#39;re going to be completely (145:29 - 145:34)
worthless in two months cuz they&#39;re (145:31 - 145:38)
going in $15 TS uh so could you beat (145:34 - 145:40)
that Mewtwo deck and dark cry deck (145:38 - 145:43)
possibly but you didn&#39;t because they (145:40 - 145:45)
were the ones that won and they were (145:43 - 145:47)
expensive (145:45 - 145:51)
decks so I was uh I was in Japan the (145:47 - 145:54)
last two weeks and I was I was sitting (145:51 - 145:57)
next to somebody who uh I will say was (145:54 - 145:59)
not very good at the trading card game I (145:57 - 146:00)
was watching them play Pocket I was (145:59 - 146:02)
editing the podcast on the shenc conin (146:00 - 146:05)
uh and I was watching them play and they (146:02 - 146:08)
were they really wanted the 45 wins and (146:05 - 146:11)
they were losing a lot and a lot of that (146:08 - 146:13)
was not really it was just they were (146:11 - 146:15)
playing badly and I&#39;m I don&#39;t know I (146:13 - 146:16)
don&#39;t want to like backseat them and be (146:15 - 146:18)
like why&#39;d you put that energy (146:16 - 146:21)
there but they asked me to like look at (146:18 - 146:23)
their decks and I like looked at them (146:21 - 146:25)
and I was like ah yeah you&#39;re missing (146:23 - 146:26)
cards for this one this is what I would (146:25 - 146:27)
tweak ah you&#39;re missing cards for this (146:26 - 146:29)
one and they were like well what do you (146:27 - 146:31)
play and I was like I play Pikachu and (146:29 - 146:32)
they were like well what is that I was (146:31 - 146:34)
like ah it&#39;s like two Pikachu EXs like (146:32 - 146:37)
two zaptos EXs and then I run like (146:34 - 146:39)
electrode and they were like I don&#39;t (146:37 - 146:40)
have any electrode I have one zaptos I (146:39 - 146:43)
don&#39;t have any Pikachu and I was like I (146:40 - 146:46)
was like yeah that&#39;s sucks you can open (146:43 - 146:48)
one pack in like five hours and they (146:46 - 146:51)
were like I just want to win and get (146:48 - 146:52)
this over with and they just dropped (146:51 - 146:55)
$100 and they just ripped Pikachu packs (146:52 - 146:56)
and they pulled the electrode they (146:55 - 146:58)
pulled the two zaptos they pulled one (146:56 - 146:59)
Pikachu and then they used their pack (146:58 - 147:01)
points and they bought another Pikachu (146:59 - 147:05)
yep and I want to say I don&#39;t think they (147:01 - 147:07)
were very good at battling but they (147:05 - 147:10)
dropped $100 and they started winning (147:07 - 147:14)
because Pikachu is really easy to (147:10 - 147:18)
Pilot and it&#39;s a very good deck it&#39;s (147:14 - 147:21)
just good it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s just good and (147:18 - 147:24)
they they they had a they felt very (147:21 - 147:26)
justified in their $100 like they were (147:24 - 147:28)
having a good time they were winning way (147:26 - 147:31)
more um they just they had fun with the (147:28 - 147:34)
deck genuinely and if that is not an (147:31 - 147:37)
instance of pay to win I don&#39;t know what (147:34 - 147:40)
to tell you now that&#39;s not to say you (147:37 - 147:42)
could as a free-to-play player pull two (147:40 - 147:44)
Pikachu cards pull electrodes or Z (147:42 - 147:47)
strios or whatever you want to put pull (147:44 - 147:50)
zaptos uh like I I won all 45 of my (147:47 - 147:52)
matches one zaptos I didn&#39;t have two (147:50 - 147:54)
zaptos I only had one would it have been (147:52 - 147:56)
easier if I had a second zaptos yeah did (147:54 - 147:58)
I have enough pack points to get another (147:56 - 148:00)
zaptos I did but I was like I&#39;m going to (147:58 - 148:03)
save my pack points for something but (148:00 - 148:09)
like just because you got lucky and you (148:03 - 148:11)
got the cards you needed for a deck (148:09 - 148:14)
doesn&#39;t discard that doesn&#39;t discredit (148:11 - 148:17)
that the game is not paid to win it (148:14 - 148:21)
is yeah just looking at pack points the (148:17 - 148:24)
fact that you can buy cards to (148:21 - 148:27)
eventually get the number of packs pack (148:24 - 148:28)
points you would need to get the exact (148:27 - 148:29)
cards you (148:28 - 148:32)
want that (148:29 - 148:35)
alone now if they were a better player (148:32 - 148:36)
and I I really don&#39;t want to like drag (148:35 - 148:37)
on their play style but if they were (148:36 - 148:40)
genuinely a better player they probably (148:37 - 148:42)
could have used any deck right but I (148:40 - 148:45)
think the point being is like when you (148:42 - 148:48)
have a really good deck you will win (148:45 - 148:50)
more often and you will get your results (148:48 - 148:51)
faster (148:50 - 148:54)
um and the only way they could have (148:51 - 148:57)
gotten that deck was by putting money in (148:54 - 149:00)
and hoping they pulled the right cards (148:57 - 149:04)
at least that quickly yep yeah I mean it (149:00 - 149:05)
look it was fun for me I got to watch (149:04 - 149:07)
somebody open $100 with the where the (149:05 - 149:09)
cards going like 200 miles hour on a (149:07 - 149:12)
train It was kind of (149:09 - 149:15)
cool hey but they got their 45 ones uh (149:12 - 149:18)
the other thing is it goes like same (149:15 - 149:20)
like hand in hand is like people also (149:18 - 149:22)
saying like so some people saying like (149:20 - 149:26)
oh the game&#39;s like not pay to (149:22 - 149:28)
win because they didn&#39;t have that (149:26 - 149:29)
experience but then it&#39;s like some (149:28 - 149:30)
people are saying well the game you (149:29 - 149:34)
can&#39;t whale in this game because they (149:30 - 149:37)
happen to pull three gold meww and so (149:34 - 149:39)
they got the whale items but again just (149:37 - 149:42)
because you got lucky (149:39 - 149:46)
doesn&#39;t mean that the whale items don&#39;t (149:42 - 149:50)
exist like I don&#39;t think Erica is is a (149:46 - 149:52)
whale (149:50 - 149:55)
item uh the rainbow Erica stuff because (149:52 - 149:58)
I spend what it was 30 bucks (149:55 - 150:01)
$25 everyone spent the same amount of (149:58 - 150:04)
money and got exactly what that was mhm (150:01 - 150:08)
like you purchased exactly what that was (150:04 - 150:09)
that&#39;s what it I guess you could call it (150:08 - 150:11)
a whale item but like (150:09 - 150:15)
yeah but with the with the black and (150:11 - 150:18)
white stuff the playm the coin I can&#39;t (150:15 - 150:21)
just buy that right (150:18 - 150:25)
like well even not directly exactly (150:21 - 150:28)
which is what makes it a whale item so (150:25 - 150:31)
like I got a $100 gift card from the (150:28 - 150:32)
Pokemon company I put it in right I (150:31 - 150:34)
bought the Erica stuff with it and then (150:32 - 150:36)
I I still have gold but like I opened (150:34 - 150:39)
probably you know 60 70 packs right so (150:36 - 150:42)
I&#39;m at like I&#39;m at like 1,200 cards mhm (150:39 - 150:45)
opened even if I was to crush all my (150:42 - 150:47)
extras I don&#39;t think I would have enough (150:45 - 150:50)
to buy all of the (150:47 - 150:53)
classic black and white stuff right I (150:50 - 150:54)
just you just don&#39;t get enough you get (150:53 - 150:56)
so many you get you you can buy (150:54 - 150:58)
everything with one Mewtwo Crush one (150:56 - 150:59)
gold mewo being crushed that&#39;s why we (150:58 - 151:01)
I&#39;m so close I just need one (150:59 - 151:04)
more right so like Hannah did not put (151:01 - 151:08)
$100 in I have not Z in so far and then (151:04 - 151:11)
you have two gold mewt yes I have (151:08 - 151:14)
technically put $100 in I have no gold (151:11 - 151:17)
cards at all nothing I have I have none (151:14 - 151:20)
of them someone in our slack got a pack (151:17 - 151:22)
with with two gold meww in in one single (151:20 - 151:24)
God pack that&#39;s that&#39;s crazy awesome and (151:22 - 151:26)
already had a gold Mewtwo so they could (151:24 - 151:29)
they could get the whole so if I (151:26 - 151:34)
wanted the black and white playmat the (151:29 - 151:37)
only option I can do is put money in and (151:34 - 151:39)
whale to get that that&#39;s that&#39;s why it&#39;s (151:37 - 151:42)
a whale item like if I want Erica I can (151:39 - 151:45)
just buy it it&#39;s right there it&#39;s a set (151:42 - 151:47)
price it&#39;s it&#39;s available to me I can (151:45 - 151:50)
just buy it and move on but these items (151:47 - 151:54)
are designed for people to be like I (151:50 - 151:57)
want this how do I get this I need to (151:54 - 151:59)
crush cards I don&#39;t have enough cards to (151:57 - 152:01)
crush I&#39;m going to buy Cards and then (151:59 - 152:03)
get that and again I I am sure there&#39;s (152:01 - 152:05)
somebody out there who has never put a (152:03 - 152:07)
dime into this game who have three gold (152:05 - 152:09)
Mewtwo Hannah might be the first person (152:07 - 152:11)
but I think somebody beat someone in our (152:09 - 152:14)
slack already already beat me but did (152:11 - 152:16)
but did that person put no money in uh I (152:14 - 152:17)
think it sounded like they may have put (152:16 - 152:19)
money in just not into that pack so you (152:17 - 152:21)
may be the first we know if that doesn&#39;t (152:19 - 152:23)
put any money maybe I shouldn&#39;t buy the (152:21 - 152:25)
premium pass but that doesn&#39;t mean that (152:23 - 152:27)
they&#39;re not whale items they&#39;re still (152:25 - 152:30)
whale items yeah and there will be more (152:27 - 152:32)
of the there&#39;s no way that there these (152:30 - 152:34)
are going to be the only items that you (152:32 - 152:37)
can get with no whatever special tickets (152:34 - 152:41)
like right mhm um and that&#39;s fine like I (152:37 - 152:42)
don&#39;t have a problem with like the Pay (152:41 - 152:45)
to Win mentality of a TCG cuz that&#39;s (152:42 - 152:46)
just what it is I used to play (152:45 - 152:48)
competitively I don&#39;t have a problem (152:46 - 152:51)
with like the Wailing stuff like (152:48 - 152:53)
everything in Pocket is not unique to (152:51 - 152:54)
pocket they have existed in like (152:53 - 152:57)
Simpsons Tapped Out Clash Royale Apex (152:54 - 152:59)
Legends fortnite like nothing here is (152:57 - 153:02)
exclusive there it&#39;s all just things (152:59 - 153:04)
they&#39;ve learned from other games like (153:02 - 153:06)
Pokemon Masters even because the same (153:04 - 153:09)
company that they know that the whales (153:06 - 153:13)
of this game will carry all the freeto (153:09 - 153:14)

whail to then support everyone who is (153:21 - 153:27)
playing for free right which is Hannah (153:24 - 153:30)
we need Bobby to whale so Hannah can (153:27 - 153:31)
play for (153:30 - 153:37)
[Laughter] (153:31 - 153:39)
free uh although the Black Friday deals (153:37 - 153:43)
are kind of good I have no gold cards I (153:39 - 153:44)
have one immersive card I have I have (153:43 - 153:46)
two immersive cards but one I got for (153:44 - 153:48)
completing a mission uh I I&#39;ve pulled (153:46 - 153:51)
one immersive card I pulled gold cards (153:48 - 153:54)
mhm I&#39;ve opened many (153:51 - 153:57)
packs I think I&#39;m at like 1400 cards (153:54 - 153:58)
right (153:57 - 154:01)
now I&#39;m about to hit, 1400 cards yeah (153:58 - 154:04)
there right about there as well and I I (154:01 - 154:06)
when when you watch somebody drop a $100 (154:04 - 154:10)
next to you they went from 1,000 to 1400 (154:06 - 154:11)
real (154:10 - 154:16)
quick yeah yeah mhm yeah I pulled my (154:11 - 154:19)
second gold Mewtwo and then I hit opened (154:16 - 154:22)
100 packs right after it so you&#39;re at (154:19 - 154:26)
500 cards yeah probably a little over (154:22 - 154:28)
with promos with like all the promo (154:26 - 154:32)
cards and the events yeah yeah yeah oh I (154:28 - 154:34)
will say real quick about the Venusaur (154:32 - 154:38)
drop event really cool that they put a (154:34 - 154:40)
so what they did before this Venusaur (154:38 - 154:43)
drop event was they did a uh a fire type (154:40 - 154:46)
Wonder pick event and so it was like (154:43 - 154:49)
Arcanine ex and there was kind of a lot (154:46 - 154:51)
like you were some different tasks and (154:49 - 154:52)
missions to complete but really it (154:51 - 154:55)
revolved around um every once in a while (154:52 - 154:58)
you got these free Wonder picks that (154:55 - 155:00)
would include a fire type Pokemon or a (154:58 - 155:02)
Blain trainer card and then some other (155:00 - 155:05)
items and then all of the Wonder picks (155:02 - 155:07)
you would do also like there were more (155:05 - 155:10)
fire type Pokemon included on the Wonder (155:07 - 155:11)
picks and then every once in a while (155:10 - 155:13)
you&#39;d have this rare Wonder pick that (155:11 - 155:15)
was like all these fire types that were (155:13 - 155:19)
rare but it was a really good move to do (155:15 - 155:21)
this Wonder pick event with Blaine and (155:19 - 155:23)
these fire types and then have this (155:21 - 155:26)
Venusaur event where all these decks are (155:23 - 155:28)
weak to fire right afterwards it&#39;s kind (155:26 - 155:30)
of just a cool little cuz there wasn&#39;t a (155:28 - 155:32)
whole lot to the fire type Wonder pick (155:30 - 155:34)
event it was really it was probably the (155:32 - 155:36)
weakest one they&#39;ve done so far yeah it (155:34 - 155:37)
was just come in and wonder it was also (155:36 - 155:39)
an event where you could very easily not (155:37 - 155:42)
get the Chase card yeah I never got I (155:39 - 155:43)
never got the Arcanine yeah neither did (155:42 - 155:47)
I that&#39;s a bummer I saw it once on (155:43 - 155:48)
wonder pick and I was like ah there&#39;s (155:47 - 155:49)
plenty of time and then I never saw it (155:48 - 155:51)
again oops I saw it once on wonder pick (155:49 - 155:53)
and I got the Arcanine the one time I (155:51 - 155:56)
did it so I was like Yay that worked but (155:53 - 155:58)
that was you know there wasn&#39;t much to (155:56 - 156:00)
that event but then when followed with (155:58 - 156:02)
the Venus or drop event and you&#39;re like (156:00 - 156:04)
oh well I didn&#39;t have Blain cards before (156:02 - 156:06)
I just picked up Blain cards it makes (156:04 - 156:08)
this ninet Tales Rapidash deck better I (156:06 - 156:10)
picked up more ninetail you know like it (156:08 - 156:11)
worked out really well and it was just (156:10 - 156:13)
like a nice touch to have that little (156:11 - 156:16)
event beforehand I don&#39;t I only have one (156:13 - 156:19)
Blain in my entire collection I should (156:16 - 156:23)
wh for another blae yeah I just I I (156:19 - 156:24)
mostly pulled on Mewtwo so I never (156:23 - 156:26)
really pulled on I think blae is a (156:24 - 156:29)
Charizard yeah I had a portion of time (156:26 - 156:31)
where I was going heavy on the Charizard (156:29 - 156:32)
side so I got a picked up a bunch of (156:31 - 156:34)
blaines and and some grass stuff as well (156:32 - 156:36)
now I&#39;m just like like like eyeing (156:34 - 156:38)
Wonder pick as a hawk being like is (156:36 - 156:39)
there a blae in here can I get it like a (156:38 - 156:42)
cheap blae I don&#39;t want to use my pack (156:39 - 156:44)
using yeah I&#39;ve been using Wonder pick (156:42 - 156:46)
to get the point to get the cards from (156:44 - 156:48)
the other packs other than Mewtwo cuz (156:46 - 156:50)
I&#39;m only pulling Mewtwo packs to look (156:48 - 156:53)
for that third gold Mewtwo that&#39;s crazy (156:50 - 156:55)
so I&#39;ve been using Wonder pick to get (156:53 - 156:59)
the Charizard and Pikachu cards yeah uh (156:55 - 157:01)
speaking of getting all the cards this (156:59 - 157:04)
will be our last thing uh a player on (157:01 - 157:07)
Reddit uh they they completed the entire (157:04 - 157:10)
game so far they got the little stamp (157:07 - 157:12)
saying congratulations you&#39;ve collected (157:10 - 157:15)
every card in this expansion uh they put (157:12 - 157:16)
in (157:15 - 157:20)
$1,500 to do that uh and then I think to (157:16 - 157:21)
get the Mew cuz they said completing (157:20 - 157:23)
base card decks which I think is just (157:21 - 157:26)
the 150 to get Mew uh they said they (157:23 - 157:27)
that was about (157:26 - 157:30)
$200 they opened (157:27 - 157:33)
1,741 packs collecting (157:30 - 157:36)
8,582 cards there is no reward for doing (157:33 - 157:40)
that they got four gold cards at the (157:36 - 157:44)
time and they did not get the pachu gold (157:40 - 157:46)
card so they actually used their points (157:44 - 157:48)
to buy the Pikachu to complete their (157:46 - 157:51)
collection they got Z zero God packs (157:48 - 157:54)
which technically they are under odds (157:51 - 157:55)
since a God pack is won in (157:54 - 158:00)
2000 um collecting the final three full (157:55 - 158:02)
art cards took the most amount of time (158:00 - 158:04)
which like makes sense Venusaur Gengar (158:02 - 158:07)
Machamp full art Machamp was the final (158:04 - 158:09)
card they reached level 47 after (158:07 - 158:11)
collecting their final card um because (158:09 - 158:14)
obviously you go up and level the more (158:11 - 158:15)
packs you (158:14 - 158:17)
open uh and the max level in the game (158:15 - 158:19)
currently is 50 not that that matters (158:17 - 158:22)
you don&#39;t get anything for (158:19 - 158:24)
that (158:22 - 158:27)
uh I saw really completed the game if (158:24 - 158:28)
they&#39;re not at the max level though yeah (158:27 - 158:30)
that&#39;s true that&#39;s true that you should (158:28 - 158:32)
leave that comment on (158:30 - 158:36)
there you should leave that comment um I (158:32 - 158:38)
also think (158:36 - 158:40)
like again being annoyed at people like (158:38 - 158:43)
not understanding like wailing or freeo (158:40 - 158:45)
play or sorry not free to play pay to (158:43 - 158:46)
win like I saw a bunch of people being (158:45 - 158:48)
like I didn&#39;t put any money in and I&#39;m (158:46 - 158:50)
at like 220 out of how many cards are it (158:48 - 158:53)
like 256 or something something like (158:50 - 158:55)
that yeah 250 something that&#39;s like the (158:53 - 158:58)
easy part the hard part is like the last (158:55 - 159:00)
like five cards you&#39;re missing yeah this (158:58 - 159:03)
is this is it&#39;s interesting to see the (159:00 - 159:05)
the stats on that because it&#39;s actually (159:03 - 159:08)
very similar to a re like to a a (159:05 - 159:12)
physical uh Pokemon card set like if you (159:08 - 159:15)
go in one data point with how much (159:12 - 159:18)
randomization there is no no I&#39;m saying (159:15 - 159:21)
that data point is it&#39;s funny (159:18 - 159:21)
TCG TCG you&#39;re going to open similar (159:25 - 159:33)
amount of packs to pull an entire set (159:28 - 159:35)
and it&#39;s not because it&#39;s it&#39;s all (159:33 - 159:37)
because it takes so much to like (159:35 - 159:39)
randomly pull one of those rare cards (159:37 - 159:41)
you&#39;re going to end up with a ton of (159:39 - 159:44)
duplicates of like the EX cards or even (159:41 - 159:46)
like some of the like full arts but (159:44 - 159:47)
that&#39;s going to take you know then it&#39;s (159:46 - 159:50)
like pulling that one super rare card (159:47 - 159:52)
like in this case they ended up having (159:50 - 159:54)
to use pack points to essentially like (159:52 - 159:56)
piku the Pikachu the gold Pikachu you (159:54 - 159:58)
see that just time and time again so (159:56 - 160:00)
it&#39;s just fun it&#39;s funny to see like (159:58 - 160:03)
this game this digital game and it seems (160:00 - 160:04)
the mechanics are working in a very (160:03 - 160:07)
similar fashion to yeah cuz there&#39;s like (160:04 - 160:10)
like no pity in the game right right I (160:07 - 160:12)
saw another post of somebody saying that (160:10 - 160:14)
they did the same thing although it (160:12 - 160:16)
wasn&#39;t as detailed so I don&#39;t know but (160:14 - 160:18)
they said they they they completed the (160:16 - 160:21)
entire game at 700 $100 which like (160:18 - 160:25)
believable totally like it&#39;s yeah it&#39;s (160:21 - 160:29)
it&#39;s just RNG um yeah but thank you to (160:25 - 160:32)
your service uh wans for life thank you (160:29 - 160:35)
for keeping this game (160:32 - 160:39)
afloat uh thank you for uh paying so (160:35 - 160:43)
none of us else have to yeah seriously (160:39 - 160:45)
has free toplay players I&#39;m not really (160:43 - 160:47)
freeo playay player you&#39;re not free to (160:45 - 160:51)
play what are you talking about (160:47 - 160:51)
um I think there&#39;s a lot of free-to-play (160:51 - 160:55)
players listening they appreciate your (160:53 - 160:58)
services of keeping this game (160:55 - 160:58)
alive that&#39;s crazy though I can&#39;t (160:59 - 161:05)
imagine putting that much money in I (161:02 - 161:06)
think I&#39;ve put that much money in Pogo (161:05 - 161:08)
but over eight years this game has been (161:06 - 161:12)
out for less than two (161:08 - 161:12)
months yeah yeah go no comment I feel (161:12 - 161:21)
like my strategy would be not now that (161:17 - 161:23)
I&#39;m I&#39;m I&#39;m probably like 30 or 40 cards (161:21 - 161:25)
away from finishing it as well cuz again (161:23 - 161:27)
it&#39;s pretty easy to get like the first (161:25 - 161:29)
200 cuz a lot of them are just Commons (161:27 - 161:31)
or whatever I feel like my strategy (161:29 - 161:34)
would just be patience in Wonder pick (161:31 - 161:36)
mhm and just like fish for what I&#39;m (161:34 - 161:38)
missing in Wonder pick I&#39;m still pretty (161:36 - 161:41)
hesitant about using pack points but (161:38 - 161:43)
yeah you can&#39;t get everything through (161:41 - 161:45)
Wonder pick though right yeah like the (161:43 - 161:48)
gold cards yeah the gold or the (161:45 - 161:50)
immersives or even the (161:48 - 161:52)
or even can you get full arts you can&#39;t (161:50 - 161:54)
get two star cards two star and above (161:52 - 161:56)
you can&#39;t get through you can only get (161:54 - 161:58)
one star and then all the the four (161:56 - 162:01)
diamonds in below in Wonder pick yeah so (161:58 - 162:03)
so that&#39;s why I would save my pack (162:01 - 162:05)
points for those and not use my pack (162:03 - 162:08)
points unlik well I the only time I used (162:05 - 162:10)
pack points was for gav war so I could (162:08 - 162:12)
finish my meww deck so I could slam (162:10 - 162:14)
people (162:12 - 162:15)
[Music] (162:14 - 162:18)
online but (162:15 - 162:21)
yeah yeah well then because just the (162:18 - 162:24)
pack points are specifically for this (162:21 - 162:27)
set so you know unlike the hourglasses (162:24 - 162:29)
the pack hourglasses which it&#39;s like at (162:27 - 162:31)
this point I&#39;m now getting the (162:29 - 162:32)
hourglasses and before I was just (162:31 - 162:34)
spending them I was just trying to (162:32 - 162:36)
complete the set just spending them to (162:34 - 162:38)
open packs and now it&#39;s like that (162:36 - 162:39)
thought of like oh there&#39;s a new set (162:38 - 162:41)
coming out in December like do I save my (162:39 - 162:44)
hourglasses for that set but pack points (162:41 - 162:46)
that&#39;s for genetic Apex so like don&#39;t (162:44 - 162:48)
say don&#39;t be saving on the p on the pack (162:46 - 162:50)
points to think like oh for a future set (162:48 - 162:53)
no this is those pack points are as far (162:50 - 162:55)
as we know they&#39;re only for genetic Apex (162:53 - 162:59)
so um I don&#39;t foresee that going away (162:55 - 163:01)
genetic Apex going away anytime soon but (162:59 - 163:03)
it is seems to be set specific for those (163:01 - 163:06)
points M yeah (163:03 - 163:09)
yeah uh okay uh I know there was more (163:06 - 163:13)
news uh that we did not get to like the (163:09 - 163:15)
Pokemon sleep stuff uh now that we&#39;ve (163:13 - 163:18)
gotten all of that out of the way we can (163:15 - 163:20)
tackle that stuff next week week so (163:18 - 163:23)
that&#39;s the plan and I think as we get (163:20 - 163:24)
closer to (163:23 - 163:27)
Christmas should be like less and less (163:24 - 163:29)
news uh (163:27 - 163:31)
ideally as companies are taking (163:29 - 163:34)
Vacations or time off um but hey I&#39;m (163:31 - 163:36)
maybe something in Scarlet Violet will (163:34 - 163:37)
break and then they&#39;ll have to like (163:36 - 163:39)
repeat the raids wasn&#39;t that like great (163:37 - 163:43)
Tusk and iron Treads like pero raids or (163:39 - 163:45)
something yeah that&#39;s right they had (163:43 - 163:47)
like three different events of that (163:45 - 163:50)
because one of them broke or something (163:47 - 163:52)
like the first walking wake iron leaves (163:50 - 163:57)
also broke I think yeah that&#39;s right yes (163:52 - 164:00)
yeah yeah so maybe something like that (163:57 - 164:01)
will (164:00 - 164:04)
happen uh something will break something (164:01 - 164:07)
will always break I&#39;m sure uh thank you (164:04 - 164:08)
