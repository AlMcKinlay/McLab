what's up everyone welcome to the (0:23 - 0:30)
576 episode of the Pokemon podcast it's (0:26 - 0:32)
super effective I'm your host Steve with (0:30 - 0:34)
me is Hannah (0:32 - 0:38)
I have been sleeping at least some with (0:34 - 0:41)
Pokemon sleep I don't know that app (0:38 - 0:43)
hasn't that app has has continued to (0:41 - 0:45)
track every day for me so I that's the (0:43 - 0:47)
same update I had last week my week's (0:45 - 0:49)
been a little chaotic (0:47 - 0:52)
Greg also here I am also here my app has (0:49 - 0:55)
not been tracking me all week (0:52 - 0:58)
but that's fine I don't need it to I (0:55 - 1:01)
know how I sleep and it's just fine and (0:58 - 1:03)
in my dreams I meet all sorts of Pokemon (1:01 - 1:06)
so it can do whatever it wants do you (1:03 - 1:08)
also have a Google home in your bedroom (1:06 - 1:09)
that you forgot about that's been (1:08 - 1:12)
tracking your sleep for two years why (1:09 - 1:15)
why would I do that there is I did find (1:12 - 1:18)
a bar a little fob that was a tattoo (1:15 - 1:21)
pillow of a device that Brent (1:18 - 1:23)
kick-started like 10 years ago and I'm (1:21 - 1:25)
like oh that thing (1:23 - 1:27)
what was that for I don't remember the (1:25 - 1:29)
name I remember the app I remember (1:27 - 1:32)
nothing about it other than we have two (1:29 - 1:36)
fobs sitting on one night stand amongst (1:32 - 1:39)
the many things he has purchased to try (1:36 - 1:41)
to get him to sleep before he went to a (1:39 - 1:43)
sleep study and the answer was the (1:41 - 1:46)
seatbelt that was (1:43 - 1:47)
sir (1:46 - 1:50)
sir um (1:47 - 1:50)
I'm sure Brent and I have a very big (1:50 - 1:56)
crossover of weird gadgets that you're (1:53 - 1:57)
supposed to make your life better but (1:56 - 2:00)
like don't there are moments when I'm (1:57 - 2:02)
like (2:00 - 2:04)
I should stop following my husband on (2:02 - 2:07)
Kickstarter because the urge to ask why (2:04 - 2:10)
every time I get a notification is very (2:07 - 2:12)
strong but I do my mantra (2:10 - 2:14)
it's his money (2:12 - 2:15)
it's not mine (2:14 - 2:18)
he probably says the same things when (2:15 - 2:21)
magic cards arrive in the mail it's fine (2:18 - 2:23)
I don't care (2:21 - 2:25)
all right so uh for the show we have (2:23 - 2:29)
Pokemon sleep check-in's been officially (2:25 - 2:32)
over a week for I think America at least (2:29 - 2:33)
so (2:32 - 2:34)
um (2:33 - 2:37)
this is like the fall off point thing I (2:34 - 2:38)
think for a lot of people you know you (2:37 - 2:39)
miss one day and all of a sudden you (2:38 - 2:41)
miss two days the Animal Crossing effect (2:39 - 2:44)
uh real boom rides happened uh there's (2:41 - 2:47)
it sure did one existed exhibit in La (2:44 - 2:50)
we'll talk about in the McDonald's stuff (2:47 - 2:52)
um (2:50 - 2:56)
so uh you know I I love talking I'm very (2:52 - 2:58)
good at talking a lot I'm very good at (2:56 - 2:59)
saying a lot of words but saying nothing (2:58 - 3:02)
at all this is very clear of this (2:59 - 3:04)
program uh but starting next week I will (3:02 - 3:06)
be in Japan we will still be recording I (3:04 - 3:09)
think I will keep the same time for Greg (3:06 - 3:12)
and Hannah minus hey look hey why will (3:09 - 3:14)
not be here next week no no I know that (3:12 - 3:16)
that's on the calendar I am in I meant (3:14 - 3:18)
oh FYI people who are going to Gen Con (3:16 - 3:21)
I'll be at 10 for uh all four days I (3:18 - 3:23)
think it would be probably handed Bobby (3:21 - 3:26)
next week uh and then but like (3:23 - 3:28)
I'm gonna be recording at like 2 A.M (3:26 - 3:29)
they're going to be recording normal (3:28 - 3:31)
time it'll be fine that is your normal (3:29 - 3:34)
time though we will yeah West Coast so (3:31 - 3:36)
if you need to shift it at all we're in (3:34 - 3:37)
a different time zone than y'all are (3:36 - 3:41)
that's true yeah but Bobby also has like (3:37 - 3:44)
family things that he has that man has (3:41 - 3:47)
kids he's got children that you can't (3:44 - 3:51)
lock in a cage like dogs that's that's (3:47 - 3:52)
true (3:51 - 3:55)
um so uh you know I the the whole point (3:52 - 3:57)
of me talking a lot is I try to keep (3:55 - 3:59)
these shows to 90 minutes and then they (3:57 - 4:01)
end up being two hours (3:59 - 4:02)
when I'm in Japan I'm gonna try to keep (4:01 - 4:05)
them to an hour only because I don't (4:02 - 4:07)
know what the Internet situation is and (4:05 - 4:09)
I still have to edit here (4:07 - 4:10)
um (4:09 - 4:12)
which last time I went to Japan was (4:10 - 4:14)
honeymoon related so will and Greg were (4:12 - 4:16)
very nice to take over all of that stuff (4:14 - 4:17)
I don't have a good excuse this time I'm (4:16 - 4:20)
going for work so I will continue (4:17 - 4:21)
working (4:20 - 4:25)
it'll just all be Pokemon yeah uh but I (4:21 - 4:27)
mean at this point you're doing nothing (4:25 - 4:30)
else in Japan of course yeah (4:27 - 4:33)
part of the Raffles I'll have plenty of (4:30 - 4:35)
time to podcasts (4:33 - 4:39)
you got nothing else happening (4:35 - 4:43)
uh a small update on that the uh events (4:39 - 4:44)
I have been invited to by the Pokemon (4:43 - 4:47)
company are none of those raffle events (4:44 - 4:49)
that I should have signed up for but (4:47 - 4:51)
that's okay again I want to stress that (4:49 - 4:53)
uh (4:51 - 4:56)
I don't know anyone (4:53 - 4:56)
I'll never see the cruise ship (4:58 - 5:02)
it's pure chaos it's I I've um so (5:03 - 5:10)
anyways I'm going to plan for the Japan (5:08 - 5:12)
shows to be an hour (5:10 - 5:13)
um so if you're like why are the shows (5:12 - 5:15)
yeah wink wink they're gonna be like (5:13 - 5:17)
three hours gonna be like I found this (5:15 - 5:18)
good Robin down the street I was talking (5:17 - 5:21)
about that laughs (5:18 - 5:23)
all right Switching gears here let's (5:21 - 5:25)
talk about Pokemon sleep it's been a (5:23 - 5:27)
week uh (5:25 - 5:30)
uh let's start with uh Hannah because I (5:27 - 5:32)
know Greg has nothing positive to say I (5:30 - 5:35)
have nothing negative to say either it (5:32 - 5:38)
just exists it is just a thing that is (5:35 - 5:40)
there and I check it sometimes I'm (5:38 - 5:43)
really enjoying it it like I said it (5:40 - 5:45)
keeps me from Doom scrolling first thing (5:43 - 5:48)
in the morning and it has mostly kept me (5:45 - 5:51)
consistently going to sleep around the (5:48 - 5:52)
same time which is one of the things (5:51 - 5:55)
that I needed extra help with although (5:52 - 5:57)
I'm still not getting credit for it (5:55 - 6:00)
that's that bug is still there (5:57 - 6:04)
um is it like going to bed on time yeah (6:00 - 6:06)
it's the getting credit for going to bed (6:04 - 6:10)
within 30 minutes of your sleep goal (6:06 - 6:11)
yeah I don't get credit for that either (6:10 - 6:13)
and like (6:11 - 6:16)
is it if you go to bed too early is that (6:13 - 6:20)
punishing for you no so it is as far as (6:16 - 6:22)
as far as we can tell in slack people (6:20 - 6:24)
have been trying to figure it out if you (6:22 - 6:27)
go to bed before the alarm goes off if (6:24 - 6:29)
you have the 30 minute alarm set if you (6:27 - 6:31)
go to bed before that you get the credit (6:29 - 6:35)
but that's not what it says (6:31 - 6:37)
I'm on (6:35 - 6:40)
well then it is if you go to bed like an (6:37 - 6:42)
hour before your bedtime then you get (6:40 - 6:45)
the credit oh because I thought my (6:42 - 6:46)
understanding was as long as you go to (6:45 - 6:48)
bed within 30 minutes of your bedtime (6:46 - 6:50)
you're good that's what it's supposed to (6:48 - 6:53)
be or at least that's what it says it's (6:50 - 6:55)
supposed to be but the way that people (6:53 - 6:57)
have been getting credit is if you go to (6:55 - 6:59)
bed more than 30 minutes before your (6:57 - 7:01)
bedtime more than 30 minutes okay is (6:59 - 7:05)
that what but that's not my bedtime no (7:01 - 7:10)
it's not bedtime is what I said and also (7:05 - 7:13)
why would why would I do it before I (7:10 - 7:15)
fall asleep within 10 minutes of me (7:13 - 7:17)
hitting that bed (7:15 - 7:19)
when I say (7:17 - 7:21)
yep if I say I'm gonna go to bed at 11 (7:19 - 7:25)
30. I am out at 11 40. nobody exists (7:21 - 7:29)
past that point which the phone has said (7:25 - 7:31)
oh you didn't fall asleep until 12 30. (7:29 - 7:35)
stop lying to me (7:31 - 7:35)
registers any sort of movement very very (7:36 - 7:42)
easily (7:39 - 7:42)
I'm using Pokeball Plus (7:44 - 7:49)
oh yeah I've been using the Pokeball (7:47 - 7:51)
plus the entire time (7:49 - 7:54)
to get my plus so I I've switched to the (7:51 - 7:56)
plus because (7:54 - 7:59)
what I found out is that (7:56 - 8:02)
the it would freeze when I would say go (7:59 - 8:04)
to sleep to Snorlax so it would do the (8:02 - 8:06)
thing but that he would never get the (8:04 - 8:08)
full animation because that's how you (8:06 - 8:09)
start and I put it down so it was frozen (8:08 - 8:12)
on a screen on (8:09 - 8:15)
all night long (8:12 - 8:15)
oh it completely froze so I'm not using (8:17 - 8:23)
the phone anymore I am using the go plus (8:20 - 8:26)
plus which died last night in the middle (8:23 - 8:29)
of the night what happens when it dies (8:26 - 8:32)
it doesn't record anything (8:29 - 8:34)
that makes sense so this morning when I (8:32 - 8:36)
plugged it into charge and checked it (8:34 - 8:39)
started the lullaby so hey Pokemon sleep (8:36 - 8:41)
I'm sleeping right now (8:39 - 8:44)
are you cheating live on this side I'm (8:41 - 8:46)
cheating live on this to see what (8:44 - 8:48)
happens if you paid for the premium pass (8:46 - 8:50)
you could just go back and tell it well (8:48 - 8:53)
the thing is is I wasn't sure if it was (8:50 - 8:55)
just gonna keep because I had started it (8:53 - 8:56)
and it died in the middle of the night (8:55 - 8:57)
so I held the button down to see if it (8:56 - 9:00)
would do its End Cycle and it started (8:57 - 9:02)
the lullaby and I'm like well that's a (9:00 - 9:04)
good test though we're too far into it (9:02 - 9:07)
now for me to stop yeah also I'm just (9:04 - 9:09)
sitting there recharging so I might as (9:07 - 9:10)
well just leave it I don't (9:09 - 9:12)
whatever we'll see if it records (9:10 - 9:14)
anything I have heard some people saying (9:12 - 9:16)
that if you just leave it on a hard (9:14 - 9:19)
surface it will kind of null out and say (9:16 - 9:21)
that wasn't sleep (9:19 - 9:22)
I mean (9:21 - 9:25)
my mattress is not exactly the softest (9:22 - 9:29)
thing that's ever existed either so (9:25 - 9:29)
um (9:30 - 9:33)
it crashes a whole lot I will say that (9:30 - 9:36)
it crashes a lot here's the thing I will (9:33 - 9:38)
say whether or not you like Pokemon (9:36 - 9:41)
sleep or Scarlet violet or Pokemon go or (9:38 - 9:44)
whatever Pokemon sleep has updated more (9:41 - 9:47)
times in the last week than scarlet and (9:44 - 9:50)
violet has in eight months they are that (9:47 - 9:53)
team is pumping out updates super (9:50 - 9:56)
communicative about it hey this super (9:53 - 9:58)
simple program crashes way too much for (9:56 - 10:00)
something this simple what is going on (9:58 - 10:02)
why did we do bad code let's try to fix (10:00 - 10:05)
it why did why did we do bad code at (10:02 - 10:08)
night good code (10:05 - 10:08)
that is a low bar (10:10 - 10:16)
the the person the social media person (10:13 - 10:18)
who is representing Pokemon sleep on the (10:16 - 10:21)
social media that is dying (10:18 - 10:23)
um is being really really communicative (10:21 - 10:25)
about it and there's just a ton of (10:23 - 10:27)
communication saying hey these things (10:25 - 10:28)
are wrong these things are going to be (10:27 - 10:30)
fixed these things have been fixed and (10:28 - 10:32)
this is this is such good communication (10:30 - 10:35)
I'm so not used to this after trying to (10:32 - 10:37)
pay attention to Pokemon Go's updates (10:35 - 10:39)
and that person is desperate to hang on (10:37 - 10:41)
to their job they got about three weeks (10:39 - 10:43)
before the company says you're fired (10:41 - 10:46)
you've been talking too much it's a I (10:43 - 10:47)
love the communication I thank them (10:46 - 10:50)
every time for their communication I (10:47 - 10:53)
mean customers love it companies don't (10:50 - 10:57)
I like the side note of not referring to (10:53 - 10:59)
Twitter as its new name the site (10:57 - 11:01)
formerly known as the site because the (10:59 - 11:02)
only people listening to the show that (11:01 - 11:05)
would be mad that you didn't call it the (11:02 - 11:07)
new name are the people who are giving (11:05 - 11:08)
Elon eight dollars a month those are the (11:07 - 11:11)
only people (11:08 - 11:11)
that mad when I S what I what I don't (11:11 - 11:18)
speak highly of Joe Rogan or Logan Paul (11:14 - 11:20)
they're on the same Circle they're (11:18 - 11:22)
awesome it is just a circle there's no (11:20 - 11:24)
overlaps there's no outside there just (11:22 - 11:26)
one solid Circle they're all in there (11:24 - 11:29)
paying eight dollars for (11:26 - 11:31)
I watched (11:29 - 11:33)
I've watched a documentary about the (11:31 - 11:36)
most recent Logan Paul scam and I turned (11:33 - 11:39)
to my husband and said why do people (11:36 - 11:43)
continue to believe this person the the (11:39 - 11:46)
zoo the like yeah the zoo the zoo thing (11:43 - 11:49)
yeah well I mean like the first time (11:46 - 11:51)
they showed themselves to be super (11:49 - 11:54)
sketched I'd be like no thank you never (11:51 - 11:57)
again why but the only suit we need to (11:54 - 11:59)
talk about right now is the Pokemon (11:57 - 12:00)

I gotta I got a Riolo (12:00 - 12:06)

premium business here the (13:14 - 13:20)
the store stuff is so conflicting and (13:17 - 13:22)
I've actually seen other people I've (13:20 - 13:24)
seen other people this is the same thing (13:22 - 13:26)
that unite had where people would be (13:24 - 13:28)
like I want to give this game money but (13:26 - 13:31)
like it's so expensive just to get (13:28 - 13:33)
something I remember when unite first (13:31 - 13:35)
came out and I was like oh man there's a (13:33 - 13:38)
cramerant outfit that's so cool and then (13:35 - 13:41)
it was like oh the outfit is like 25 (13:38 - 13:44)
yeah it's just for your your character (13:41 - 13:46)
to wear this we're not talking about the (13:44 - 13:48)
40 nine tail skin which still exists by (13:46 - 13:50)
the way there are multiple forty dollar (13:48 - 13:53)
skins in that game but here's the thing (13:50 - 13:56)
I never (13:53 - 13:59)

last well pretty much ever since it came (14:10 - 14:15)
out and (14:12 - 14:18)

mess right current in the current season (14:36 - 14:40)
I am at Ultra one thank you very much I (14:38 - 14:42)

anyways there are two also too many item (15:04 - 15:09)
currencies in sleep I don't know what (15:06 - 15:10)
everything does I don't I mean I think (15:09 - 15:12)
the current the currency stuff doesn't (15:10 - 15:15)
bother me like it's a little bit less (15:12 - 15:16)
hair (15:15 - 15:20)
dream diamonds (15:16 - 15:20)
well there's just (15:22 - 15:26)
a step by stuff but then there's also (15:23 - 15:28)
the dream shards and then there's the (15:26 - 15:29)
things that you can break up into more (15:28 - 15:32)
dream shards and but those are all just (15:29 - 15:33)
items that's like Stardust and Pokemon (15:32 - 15:35)
go yeah the dream shards are just like (15:33 - 15:39)
Stardust which is whatever I mean like (15:35 - 15:41)
you're you're you you're literally using (15:39 - 15:42)
the dream (15:41 - 15:45)
shards to level up and that's it for my (15:42 - 15:47)
understanding the fact that there are (15:45 - 15:49)
only two currencies you need for the (15:47 - 15:53)
shops is less than some other games true (15:49 - 15:55)
maybe three I think there's a difference (15:53 - 15:58)
between paid and non-paid diamonds (15:55 - 15:59)
um (15:58 - 16:01)
well there's the there's the premium (15:59 - 16:04)
like I I get access to like the back of (16:01 - 16:07)
the store right yeah they like move the (16:04 - 16:09)
beads over and I get to walk in and my (16:07 - 16:12)
my my stuff is like slightly discounted (16:09 - 16:15)
from the regular Exchange store yeah but (16:12 - 16:17)
if you go into the General Store and you (16:15 - 16:21)
click on your diamonds to see you guys (16:17 - 16:21)
but if you go into the diamond store it (16:21 - 16:25)
tells you the difference between paid (16:24 - 16:27)
diamonds and non-paid diamonds and it (16:25 - 16:29)
says that paid diamonds will be used (16:27 - 16:31)
first so (16:29 - 16:33)
that at least is being taken into (16:31 - 16:35)
account I don't think that it keeps me (16:33 - 16:37)
from buying anything (16:35 - 16:38)
but I open the app it's going to know (16:37 - 16:40)
that I'm cheating (16:38 - 16:41)
it's true (16:40 - 16:44)
you're gonna know no it's not no it's (16:41 - 16:45)
no it's time (16:44 - 16:48)
I do think it's interesting (16:45 - 16:49)
and I don't I don't know if I've seen (16:48 - 16:51)
another game do that so if I go into my (16:49 - 16:53)
premium Exchange store I've bought all (16:51 - 16:55)
the Pokey biscuits for the week which (16:53 - 16:57)
for me a pokey Biscuit's only 100 I (16:55 - 17:00)
think for you guys it's 150. and so you (16:57 - 17:02)
have to wait until the store restocks so (17:00 - 17:04)
if I want more Pokey biscuits I can't (17:02 - 17:06)
literally buy them for 100 points (17:04 - 17:09)
because I bought them all so I either (17:06 - 17:12)
have to go to the the the the pleb store (17:09 - 17:14)
and pay more money (17:12 - 17:16)
150 or I have to pay real money like (17:14 - 17:18)
those are my only two options because I (17:16 - 17:21)
purchased all of the ones in the premium (17:18 - 17:25)
store but that's all just with (17:21 - 17:28)
with sweet points yeah and that's a (17:25 - 17:30)
different thing because you can't buy (17:28 - 17:32)
sleep points right so they're limiting (17:30 - 17:34)
your purchases on the things that don't (17:32 - 17:38)
cost actual money yes (17:34 - 17:40)
so then I'm going to just keep paying (17:38 - 17:43)
actual money and I think every so I (17:40 - 17:46)
think everyone can earn 600 diamonds (17:43 - 17:48)
pretty easy like if you've played the (17:46 - 17:49)
game for like a week and you're just (17:48 - 17:52)
doing the tasks because some tasks will (17:49 - 17:54)
give you diamonds I think everyone (17:52 - 17:57)
should be able to like I have 800 (17:54 - 18:00)
diamonds right now I haven't spent any (17:57 - 18:01)
money (18:00 - 18:04)
I've just been doing like the tasks or (18:01 - 18:09)
whatever so I so if if you are 970. (18:04 - 18:10)
that's because you're you're you're (18:09 - 18:12)
you're I'm missing I'm missing the most (18:10 - 18:13)
important meal of the day this is why (18:12 - 18:16)
I'm behind I'm missing breakfast (18:13 - 18:18)
um so I think if if you do have the (18:16 - 18:21)
diamonds I do think that one bundle is (18:18 - 18:23)
probably the one that is worth it the (18:21 - 18:25)
one you should get which is the release (18:23 - 18:28)
celebration small (18:25 - 18:30)
yeah the one that's not fifty dollars (18:28 - 18:33)
600 gems one it's (18:30 - 18:36)
it's 15 Pokey biscuits and three friend (18:33 - 18:38)
incense and when I was looking at the (18:36 - 18:41)
incense the friend incense seems to be (18:38 - 18:43)
the best one (18:41 - 18:46)
which friend incense is ensures at least (18:43 - 18:48)
one Pokemon during snack time will be (18:46 - 18:49)
hungry (18:48 - 18:54)
growth is double the amount of XP (18:49 - 18:58)
uh luck is double the amount of dream (18:54 - 19:01)
shards and then focus is double the (18:58 - 19:03)
research XP (19:01 - 19:05)
so and there are also the Pokemon (19:03 - 19:07)
specific incense that you can earn so (19:05 - 19:09)
I've gotten a Rattata specific incense (19:07 - 19:12)
which will just attract extra Rattata (19:09 - 19:15)
why if I'm trying to go down that that (19:12 - 19:17)
sounds awesome you can earn it through (19:15 - 19:20)
one of one of the things you earn (19:17 - 19:22)
um and I used the friend incense last (19:20 - 19:24)
night and it was really nice to wake up (19:22 - 19:26)
to one Pokemon that I knew that I could (19:24 - 19:28)
catch (19:26 - 19:29)
pretty much (19:28 - 19:31)
um although I think (19:29 - 19:33)
it may have ended up being on an evolved (19:31 - 19:35)
Pokemon I I got two Pokemon that were (19:33 - 19:37)
extra hungry today that was very nice (19:35 - 19:39)
one of them I wasn't able to catch (19:37 - 19:42)
see so because (19:39 - 19:45)
it (19:42 - 19:47)
I feel like I catch two Pokemon a day (19:45 - 19:50)
easy yeah that's just because you're (19:47 - 19:51)
buying stuff (19:50 - 19:54)
well okay again I have not bought (19:51 - 19:56)
anything with gems I've been spending my (19:54 - 19:58)
points (19:56 - 20:01)
yeah yeah so how many points do you have (19:58 - 20:05)
uh like because I I I had way more than (20:01 - 20:06)
four thousand points so I've got the (20:05 - 20:08)
master ball and now I'm I'm probably (20:06 - 20:10)
sitting at about a thousand yeah I have (20:08 - 20:12)
four thousand five hundred points I have (20:10 - 20:14)
bought three or four Pokey biscuits (20:12 - 20:17)
total okay but that's it I'm not buying (20:14 - 20:19)
Pokey biscuits every day I'm just oh (20:17 - 20:21)
yeah I was buying probably at least two (20:19 - 20:25)
Pokey biscuits a day yeah (20:21 - 20:25)
your higher Ultra Ball but like I'm I (20:27 - 20:33)
have more Pokemon even so there's no (20:31 - 20:35)
correlation of like that doesn't matter (20:33 - 20:38)
because you can catch different kinds of (20:35 - 20:40)
Pokemon I can catch more kinds of (20:38 - 20:43)
Pokemon than you can because of how (20:40 - 20:45)
quickly I am going through because of (20:43 - 20:48)
how many meals I'm feeding my Snorlax (20:45 - 20:51)
mm-hmm (20:48 - 20:51)
yeah with the friend incense I would (20:54 - 20:58)
recommend I would recommend doing the (20:56 - 20:59)
friend incense at the end of the week (20:58 - 21:02)
when your Snorlax is more powerful so (20:59 - 21:05)
that you could potentially get stressed (21:02 - 21:07)
um rarer Pokemon (21:05 - 21:09)
showing up being hungry (21:07 - 21:12)
I I just don't like if if you just cared (21:09 - 21:14)
about completing your Pokedex (21:12 - 21:17)
or like getting as many Pokemon as (21:14 - 21:19)
possible or I mean that I mean that's (21:17 - 21:20)
the point of the game right is to like (21:19 - 21:22)
finish your sleep decks yeah that has (21:20 - 21:24)
nothing to do really with powering up (21:22 - 21:26)
Snorlax oh yeah it does (21:24 - 21:29)
I mean yeah you could get like uh it (21:26 - 21:31)
does if you're trying to complete your (21:29 - 21:34)
sleep decks you need to be able to see (21:31 - 21:36)
the Pokemon that you don't have in your (21:34 - 21:37)
sleep decks and you need the Snorlax to (21:36 - 21:39)
be stronger for that yeah you just keep (21:37 - 21:41)
getting rattatas over and over until you (21:39 - 21:43)
have enough candy and then you evolve it (21:41 - 21:46)
to eradicate I mean easy (21:43 - 21:46)
the slow way (21:47 - 21:52)
I mean I've never seen a Cubone and (21:50 - 21:55)
today I got a Marowak and the Marowak (21:52 - 21:59)
was hungry and he needed 12 in 12 hearts (21:55 - 22:02)
and my premium biscuit gave him all 12 (21:59 - 22:06)
Hearts so I got him right instantly (22:02 - 22:07)
so like (22:06 - 22:10)
the the premium thing is busted in the (22:07 - 22:13)
sense of like I'm guaranteeing (22:10 - 22:15)
I I'm pretty much guaranteed a Pokemon (22:13 - 22:17)
if it's hungry and I have premium that's (22:15 - 22:18)
like guaranteed (22:17 - 22:21)
and it is not for a non-premium I had a (22:18 - 22:24)
weeping Bell show up and a toxic rope (22:21 - 22:26)
show up today and the Weeping Bell was (22:24 - 22:29)
hungry and I used my daily biscuit on it (22:26 - 22:31)
and it did not I mean it only got nine (22:29 - 22:33)
out of 12. so it's going to take at (22:31 - 22:35)
least one more day if not two (22:33 - 22:38)
have you had it where like for sure that (22:35 - 22:41)
Pokemon's coming back the next day (22:38 - 22:41)
I don't think so what do you mean (22:41 - 22:45)
because I've I've never had it where (22:43 - 22:47)
like (22:45 - 22:48)
because I have premium biscuits or (22:47 - 22:51)
enough biscuits again I have not (22:48 - 22:52)
purchased any biscuits with your money (22:51 - 22:54)
I've just been using points I have never (22:52 - 22:56)
had it where like I've given a Pokemon (22:54 - 22:58)
like two biscuits and then it says it's (22:56 - 23:01)
full and then it leaves or I've never (22:58 - 23:03)
like given it a biscuit and oh I don't (23:01 - 23:05)
have any so it's only like two out of (23:03 - 23:08)
six and then it leaves so I've heard it (23:05 - 23:10)
comes back and it still remembers that (23:08 - 23:12)
you gave it a biscuit oh yeah it doesn't (23:10 - 23:15)
necessarily come back the next day but (23:12 - 23:17)
when it comes back it remembers and yes (23:15 - 23:18)
that's happened to me a lot because I (23:17 - 23:20)
don't have the premium biscuits (23:18 - 23:24)
the premium biscuit crazy good (23:20 - 23:24)
this week (23:28 - 23:32)
uh because does it actually change (23:30 - 23:35)
things uh well the tent still says the (23:32 - 23:37)
same color (23:35 - 23:40)
uh which I the it says it says so it (23:37 - 23:42)
says one day of effect left (23:40 - 23:44)
an extra Pokemon will appear for your (23:42 - 23:46)
sleep research and be extra hungry (23:44 - 23:49)
that's not guaranteed though (23:46 - 23:52)
maybe I don't know maybe that is scary I (23:49 - 23:55)
I it's hard to tell cooking pot will be (23:52 - 23:57)
50 larger this (23:55 - 23:59)
I mean the the tent lasts for a full (23:57 - 24:01)
week (23:59 - 24:03)
I don't think the tent is good to so if (24:01 - 24:05)
you haven't used your tent ticket I (24:03 - 24:08)
would hold off because I just (24:05 - 24:11)
unlocked (24:08 - 24:13)
a bigger pot today (24:11 - 24:15)
so I think (24:13 - 24:18)
I could do like 23 instead of 15 but now (24:15 - 24:20)
I can do (24:18 - 24:23)
26 I think because the pot the larger (24:20 - 24:26)
pot added plus three but even so like (24:23 - 24:29)
I I have like two ingredients I have (24:26 - 24:31)
like honey and apples and like sometimes (24:29 - 24:33)
I have like sausage (24:31 - 24:36)
but like I can't really make how do you (24:33 - 24:38)
have so many Pokemon and not enough (24:36 - 24:41)
ingredients no I I I can I can like cap (24:38 - 24:43)
it out but it's I don't know like I'm (24:41 - 24:45)
not getting anything like I'm just (24:43 - 24:46)
making fancy (24:45 - 24:50)
eggs and apples and I just got a Pokemon (24:46 - 24:52)
that can bring sausage and I'm getting (24:50 - 24:55)
oil and oh okay so I have all that but (24:52 - 24:57)
because Snorlax said he just wanted (24:55 - 25:00)
salads this week uh I switched my team (24:57 - 25:02)
to Pokemon that were mostly bringing (25:00 - 25:04)
apples and then I thought maybe honey (25:02 - 25:07)
was okay for salads but he don't it's (25:04 - 25:08)
just it's just a flavor enhancer at this (25:07 - 25:09)
point (25:08 - 25:12)
I was like ah maybe maybe honey and (25:09 - 25:13)
salad goes together I don't know I've (25:12 - 25:15)
never eaten salad before (25:13 - 25:19)
see this is valid you haven't (25:15 - 25:19)
and then it says helpers will work 20 (25:21 - 25:26)
faster and then helpers will be able to (25:22 - 25:28)
carry 20 more berries this is a 10 (25:26 - 25:30)
ticket by the way I only got it because (25:28 - 25:33)
the premium thing gave gives you one a (25:30 - 25:34)
month for free (25:33 - 25:37)
um so like if I think I said this last (25:34 - 25:39)
week if you ever ever considering to buy (25:37 - 25:42)
the good camp ticket (25:39 - 25:44)
and you don't have premium just get a (25:42 - 25:46)
month of Premium because you get this (25:44 - 25:47)
ticket for free and you get all the (25:46 - 25:49)
other benefits don't ever buy this (25:47 - 25:52)
ticket alone it makes no sense (25:49 - 25:55)
you get one a month for free but again (25:52 - 25:57)
if you if you're on your premium free (25:55 - 25:59)
trial that means you got one right (25:57 - 26:03)
I would not maybe use it until you are (25:59 - 26:05)
confident like I kind of regret using it (26:03 - 26:07)
the second week I'm glad I used it (26:05 - 26:09)
because I'm like okay what does it do (26:07 - 26:10)
but like since you're still in the early (26:09 - 26:12)
stage of the game I feel like (26:10 - 26:15)
what Hannah said with the incense like (26:12 - 26:17)
use it nor the end none of the week to (26:15 - 26:19)
get better benefits yeah but the camp (26:17 - 26:21)
lasts the whole week (26:19 - 26:25)
the incense only lasts one night (26:21 - 26:29)
yeah it does but I feel like if I had (26:25 - 26:33)
just better Pokemon prep for it like I (26:29 - 26:36)
like okay I am now to the point where I (26:33 - 26:38)
have so many Pokemon where I'm like (26:36 - 26:41)
okay these are actually good like (26:38 - 26:42)
they're they're Natures line up with (26:41 - 26:44)
their abilities or their abilities are (26:42 - 26:46)
really strong and I I didn't know a lot (26:44 - 26:48)
of that until trial and error right like (26:46 - 26:51)
yeah is there is a lot to this game is (26:48 - 26:53)
it worth it to have like Pikachu (26:51 - 26:56)
power-ups Snorlax 400 like right now yes (26:53 - 26:58)
in the future maybe no because 400 is (26:56 - 27:01)
like small in the grand scheme of things (26:58 - 27:04)
like I found a like I found a Bulbasaur (27:01 - 27:06)
that is just killing it by bringing (27:04 - 27:08)
stuff he's bringing so much stuff (27:06 - 27:11)
compared to everyone else so it's it is (27:08 - 27:14)
that trial of an error of like he has (27:11 - 27:16)
the right ability and the right nature (27:14 - 27:19)
and he's just he's just he's bringing (27:16 - 27:21)
boatloads of stuff every day and then (27:19 - 27:23)
these other Pokemon are not like I have (27:21 - 27:25)
a I had a Jigglypuff that was like level (27:23 - 27:27)
five I got I got her at level four and (27:25 - 27:29)
that Marowak I just got today is level (27:27 - 27:32)
nine and it's it has the same skills as (27:29 - 27:33)
the Jigglypuff but it's like way better (27:32 - 27:36)
like so that's like what you're talking (27:33 - 27:36)
about (27:36 - 27:39)
leveling up your Pokemon does seriously (27:36 - 27:41)
help I got my Pikachu pass level 10 and (27:39 - 27:44)
that changed the game yeah (27:41 - 27:47)
I had a Pikachu and a peach who just to (27:44 - 27:48)
power up a Pikachu because Pichu is (27:47 - 27:50)
obviously getting Pikachu candy and once (27:48 - 27:52)
Pikachu hit ten he's he's killing it too (27:50 - 27:54)
he's bringing everything (27:52 - 27:56)
did you optimize your Pokemon to bring (27:54 - 27:58)
the right berries for Snorlax that's the (27:56 - 27:59)
other thing I want to make sure people (27:58 - 28:01)
know (27:59 - 28:05)
this Snorlax has Preferred berries every (28:01 - 28:06)
week that's why you're supposed to (28:05 - 28:09)
change your team yeah because Snorlax (28:06 - 28:10)
has Preferred berries (28:09 - 28:15)
yep so like I love how in depth the like (28:10 - 28:17)
like we just talked about how like (28:15 - 28:19)
in-depth this game could be but it's (28:17 - 28:22)
also like slow at the same time because (28:19 - 28:25)
you can't do too much it's mostly like (28:22 - 28:28)
like strategizing your week of like this (28:25 - 28:30)
is the five Pokemon I'm bringing because (28:28 - 28:31)
this is what Snorlax wants and that's (28:30 - 28:33)
gonna optimize my Snorlax which is then (28:31 - 28:36)
supposed it's literally like (28:33 - 28:39)
a cookie clicker or a trips in a sense (28:36 - 28:41)
like it is very similar to Magikarp jump (28:39 - 28:42)
of like (28:41 - 28:44)
I'm gonna optimize this stuff I'm gonna (28:42 - 28:45)
check in three or four times a day and (28:44 - 28:47)
then I'm gonna come back which is like (28:45 - 28:49)
the kind of game I absolutely love that (28:47 - 28:51)
being said the sleeping part of the game (28:49 - 28:53)
is still bad like if you are only (28:51 - 28:56)
getting this to track your sleep it is (28:53 - 28:59)
bad at doing that it's a good sleep (28:56 - 29:02)
tracker (28:59 - 29:02)
the game part is pretty okay (29:03 - 29:09)
and it's way way way more detailed than (29:07 - 29:11)
I expected it to be I'm still not sure (29:09 - 29:13)
if it's too detailed or not because (29:11 - 29:15)
there is a lot going on (29:13 - 29:17)
I'm still really enjoying it though (29:15 - 29:19)
yeah I like it a lot the last thing I'll (29:17 - 29:21)
say is I there's (29:19 - 29:24)
there is a small part of me (29:21 - 29:27)
that wakes up (29:24 - 29:31)
in fear of stuff not working (29:27 - 29:34)
like which is you've had a crash once (29:31 - 29:37)
right I I I no everything's work fine (29:34 - 29:39)
for me okay I had the app crash by going (29:37 - 29:43)
too fast before yes like if if they're (29:39 - 29:45)
collecting berries and then if you go to (29:43 - 29:47)
try to like feed him but then you back (29:45 - 29:48)
out and you like go to a different menu (29:47 - 29:50)
the game like kicks you back the title (29:48 - 29:52)
yeah I do everything in a specific order (29:50 - 29:54)
so I don't feed Snorlax berries until (29:52 - 29:56)
I'm about to close the app so it just (29:54 - 29:59)
doesn't crash on me yeah if you go too (29:56 - 30:00)
fast it like crashes I haven't lost any (29:59 - 30:02)
sleep data or anything like that this (30:00 - 30:07)
this but okay so when I I am the person (30:02 - 30:09)
that has like five alarms right like I (30:07 - 30:13)
have like the the like 650 655 7 o'clock (30:09 - 30:15)
705. this is like a real thing that (30:13 - 30:16)
other people have (30:15 - 30:19)
and the non the non-like six alarm (30:16 - 30:22)
people don't get it so I I have like the (30:19 - 30:24)
six alarms right (30:22 - 30:27)
um and when I was like 22 I found this (30:24 - 30:31)
alarm clock that had like Wheels (30:27 - 30:33)
I can't remember what was called oh yeah (30:31 - 30:34)
I know what you're talking about but the (30:33 - 30:36)
whole point of the alarm clock was when (30:34 - 30:38)
it went off it would drive off your (30:36 - 30:41)
bedside table and then it would force (30:38 - 30:44)
you to get up to chase it because then (30:41 - 30:45)
you would have to get up and then turn (30:44 - 30:47)
it off and then because you're out of (30:45 - 30:51)
bed you don't have like six alarms right (30:47 - 30:54)
and what happened was instead of it like (30:51 - 30:56)
like (30:54 - 30:58)
then rush off the counter and then like (30:56 - 31:00)
slide into the bed and it's like driving (30:58 - 31:01)
around and stuff and you're trying to (31:00 - 31:05)
get it I would be so terrified of that (31:01 - 31:07)
happening I would wake up in like cold (31:05 - 31:10)
sweats before it would go off and I (31:07 - 31:13)
would be at it I guess it worked in a (31:10 - 31:15)
sense of like I'm so scared of this (31:13 - 31:18)
thing going off that is please tell me (31:15 - 31:19)
this isn't happening with Pokemon sleep (31:18 - 31:22)
it is and like I have been waking up (31:19 - 31:25)
like 10 minutes before like the the time (31:22 - 31:27)
I think I'm getting up because like I'm (31:25 - 31:29)
like I don't know like it's not as bad (31:27 - 31:32)
but like there's a there's a I think I (31:29 - 31:34)
wake up of like oh did everything work (31:32 - 31:36)
did my Pokeball plus die did it fall off (31:34 - 31:39)
did Archer step on it did the app crash (31:36 - 31:42)
like I have this little I have this (31:39 - 31:44)
small not a huge amount of anxiety but a (31:42 - 31:46)
small amount of anxiety of like oh it's (31:44 - 31:49)
all gonna break (31:46 - 31:49)
but it's been working just fine for you (31:49 - 31:53)
so far I know it's Greg Greg's (31:51 - 31:55)
propaganda over here is a lot of people (31:53 - 31:58)
have been having issues there there are (31:55 - 31:59)
a lot of ways that this can go wrong (31:58 - 32:01)
it's very easy to roll over on top of (31:59 - 32:04)
the Pokeball plus crashes all the time (32:01 - 32:08)
yep but as like a premium user I (32:04 - 32:10)
shouldn't be as a premium user I (32:08 - 32:11)
shouldn't be as upset because I should (32:10 - 32:13)
be able to go back and like fix it but (32:11 - 32:16)
yeah it doesn't let you edit stuff no (32:13 - 32:17)
like still that like weird Wednesday (32:16 - 32:19)
where it was like you slept four hours (32:17 - 32:22)
and I was like but I I didn't maybe I (32:19 - 32:24)
accidentally hit the Pokeball plus and (32:22 - 32:26)
it recorded and I accidentally stopped (32:24 - 32:28)
it like that's my only assumption is (32:26 - 32:29)
accidentally hit it when it was in my (32:28 - 32:30)
pocket (32:29 - 32:32)
like I can't go back and delete that (32:30 - 32:35)
it's just you've you've slept four hours (32:32 - 32:36)
randomly in the middle of the day but I (32:35 - 32:38)
was like I didn't but like I'll I guess (32:36 - 32:39)
I'll take the points but like I didn't (32:38 - 32:42)
do that and I can't I tell you I didn't (32:39 - 32:44)
do that (32:42 - 32:47)
you are caring way too much about us if (32:44 - 32:50)
you're waking up being like oh man I (32:47 - 32:52)
better check and make sure it worked (32:50 - 32:55)
it's not it's not worth it like it's (32:52 - 32:57)
supposed to help your sleep not make it (32:55 - 32:59)
worse (32:57 - 33:02)
yeah I'm I'm with Greg on this one (32:59 - 33:05)
like that is that is that is not what (33:02 - 33:08)
the game should be doing okay (33:05 - 33:08)
a little bit like I I I like Hannah is (33:09 - 33:14)
is you know I'm not (33:12 - 33:15)
on (33:14 - 33:18)
Tick Tock as long well like here here (33:15 - 33:20)
like I think sometimes I would I would (33:18 - 33:22)
like go on Tick Tock and then I'd be (33:20 - 33:24)
like okay like let me check Reddit real (33:22 - 33:25)
quick let me check my emails set my (33:24 - 33:28)
alarm and then like (33:25 - 33:31)
maybe sneak back to Tick Tock but I feel (33:28 - 33:33)
like once I once the Pikachu does his (33:31 - 33:37)
lullaby it is for me this now like (33:33 - 33:40)
I don't touch my phone anymore (33:37 - 33:43)
like once I hit the lullaby (33:40 - 33:45)
I am pretty much like done for the night (33:43 - 33:48)
and I think I know I do I do like that (33:45 - 33:51)
uh this is this Falls of the eye with my (33:48 - 33:55)
no TV no screens in the bedroom (33:51 - 33:57)
it when we're in that bedroom they all (33:55 - 33:59)
go off (33:57 - 34:03)
just go somewhere else to do that stuff (33:59 - 34:05)
it's the same thing like (34:03 - 34:08)
you train yourself that is okay to do (34:05 - 34:11)
those things at the cost of your sleep (34:08 - 34:14)
when you have them in your bedroom (34:11 - 34:17)
so if you just never do that like if I'm (34:14 - 34:21)
tired and I'm like I am somewhat tired (34:17 - 34:22)
but not I don't think I can sleep I'm (34:21 - 34:24)
not going into the bed because I don't (34:22 - 34:26)
want to associate the bed with anything (34:24 - 34:30)
other than sleeping (34:26 - 34:32)
maybe one or two other things but we are (34:30 - 34:34)
not going to talk about that (34:32 - 34:37)
but the bed is to sleep in it is not to (34:34 - 34:39)
watch TV it is not to play on my phone (34:37 - 34:42)
it is not to do these things it is just (34:39 - 34:45)
for sleep but I'm pretty digital you (34:42 - 34:47)
know Brent I almost said the same as (34:45 - 34:48)
like if you're going to watch your phone (34:47 - 34:50)
go sit in the tub (34:48 - 34:52)
because this is not where we do that (34:50 - 34:55)
stuff this is for where we sleep you or (34:52 - 34:56)
he already can't sleep the way it is (34:55 - 34:58)
okay so don't be uncomfortable the tub (34:56 - 34:59)
is for rubber duckies and to be clean (34:58 - 35:02)
correct no fun for him to almost drop (34:59 - 35:06)
his phone multiple times into the water (35:02 - 35:09)
[Laughter] (35:06 - 35:12)
sleep advice before he (35:09 - 35:16)
he got the CPAP he would sleep (35:12 - 35:19)
bathe which means he would grab all of (35:16 - 35:21)
his stuff go (35:19 - 35:23)
start the bathtub and get in the bathtub (35:21 - 35:26)
and never once be awake for that process (35:23 - 35:29)
his most spray was mostly asleep but he (35:26 - 35:30)
was going through the most so he would (35:29 - 35:32)
often be like I just woke up because the (35:30 - 35:34)
phone fell out of my hand and that was (35:32 - 35:35)
the first time my brain was aware of (35:34 - 35:38)
what was happening I'm in the tub the (35:35 - 35:41)
tub is filling with water (35:38 - 35:43)
that's kind of terrifying I used to be (35:41 - 35:45)
the person who would fall asleep (35:43 - 35:47)
watching like The Simpsons like I had (35:45 - 35:49)
like now I know maybe with all the (35:47 - 35:50)
Simpsons on it (35:49 - 35:54)
I would I would always like fully be (35:50 - 35:56)
awake and watch an episode and then (35:54 - 35:58)
never remember what the second episode (35:56 - 36:01)
was so I'd be like get to bed bring my (35:58 - 36:04)
water lay down watch the first episode (36:01 - 36:05)
for 22 minutes and then the second (36:04 - 36:07)
episode would start I would never (36:05 - 36:08)
remember which one the second episode (36:07 - 36:10)
was like I'm I'm out after 22 minutes (36:08 - 36:13)
and then when I moved here (36:10 - 36:15)
I didn't have everything set up and I (36:13 - 36:18)
was I was able there's no TV right so (36:15 - 36:19)
the last two years I've lived here I (36:18 - 36:20)
don't fall asleep with the TV the the (36:19 - 36:22)
exception is when I traveled on a hotel (36:20 - 36:24)
and the main reason I have a TV on when (36:22 - 36:25)
I travel in the hotel is just to cancel (36:24 - 36:27)
out the hallway noises that's pretty (36:25 - 36:28)
much it (36:27 - 36:30)
um (36:28 - 36:31)
and I don't sleep like I know the whole (36:30 - 36:33)
like well you shouldn't have the TV on (36:31 - 36:35)
you'll sleep you sleep worse with the (36:33 - 36:37)
team it's no different to me like I'm (36:35 - 36:39)
still like like for some people I (36:37 - 36:41)
understand that like the TV on does (36:39 - 36:43)
affect them and does it's just like Greg (36:41 - 36:45)
I'm watching Greg like slim a g feel and (36:43 - 36:47)
being like Oh you're sleeping like it (36:45 - 36:51)
like everyone is different like for me (36:47 - 36:53)
TV on or TV off doesn't affect my (36:51 - 36:55)
quality of sleep (36:53 - 36:57)
um although I don't like waking up at (36:55 - 36:59)
5am with the TV on like I TR I always do (36:57 - 37:02)
set the timer when I I have a TV for it (36:59 - 37:04)
to auto shut off but (37:02 - 37:06)
because like sometimes when you're in a (37:04 - 37:07)
hotel and you wake up and the TV's on (37:06 - 37:09)
and they're doing like yeah I just (37:07 - 37:11)
didn't even know TV's had a timer (37:09 - 37:15)
they've had timers since the 80s (37:11 - 37:15)
we can't we can't we can't do this we (37:16 - 37:23)
cannot go down this Rabbit Hole today (37:21 - 37:25)
we're gonna have to start an entire (37:23 - 37:27)
mini-series things that TVs could do (37:25 - 37:29)
that a Hannah had no clue did you know (37:27 - 37:33)
the primary colors of light are (37:29 - 37:33)
there's like a timer button on the (37:35 - 37:39)
remote (37:37 - 37:42)
I know that my audiobook app has a timer (37:39 - 37:46)
that's what I use when I go to sleep (37:42 - 37:48)
I quit (37:46 - 37:51)
we're gonna take a break (37:48 - 37:55)
we'll be right back (37:51 - 37:55)
and we are back from our break uh so the (37:57 - 38:03)
last (38:01 - 38:05)
starter (38:03 - 38:07)
ever ever yes they're never making (38:05 - 38:10)
another this is it we were done it was a (38:07 - 38:12)
good run we've done 10. (38:10 - 38:15)
no starters (38:12 - 38:17)
calling it now (38:15 - 38:19)
so the Seven Star gorilla boom raid (38:17 - 38:20)
happened this weekend it will be (38:19 - 38:22)
repeating this upcoming weekend if (38:20 - 38:24)
you're listening to this on Monday it (38:22 - 38:26)
will be repeating I will not be able to (38:24 - 38:27)
help you because I will be in Japan so (38:26 - 38:30)
sorry I normally help both weekends I (38:27 - 38:32)
cannot help you yeah I had to do it this (38:30 - 38:33)
weekend because I'll be in Gen Con and (38:32 - 38:35)
I'm not bringing my switch (38:33 - 38:38)
uh you should bring your sweet no no (38:35 - 38:39)
never mind you're good I was gonna say (38:38 - 38:40)
you should bring your switch because of (38:39 - 38:42)
the world's distribution but that's the (38:40 - 38:44)
week after that's the week after look I (38:42 - 38:46)
plan things accordingly don't I'm a (38:44 - 38:50)
Pokemon professional thank you very much (38:46 - 38:51)
so (38:50 - 38:53)
um Seven Star real boom showed up the (38:51 - 38:55)
reason I say this is because uh like (38:53 - 39:00)
sword and shield we knew a handful of (38:55 - 39:02)
Pokemon that were not accessible in the (39:00 - 39:05)
game beforehand we knew that there were (39:02 - 39:07)
a handful of starters that were in the (39:05 - 39:08)
game turns out all the starters ended up (39:07 - 39:09)
being seven star raids starting with (39:08 - 39:12)
Charizard Greninja moving forward there (39:09 - 39:14)
are no more starters in the game I want (39:12 - 39:15)
to be clear there are no more there's no (39:14 - 39:17)
incineroar there's no Meganium there's (39:15 - 39:20)
no uh primarina there are there for all (39:17 - 39:21)
everyone that keeps saying I can't wait (39:20 - 39:23)
for the Gen 3 starters to come there are (39:21 - 39:25)
no more starters in the game we are done (39:23 - 39:27)
that gorilla boom was the last one that (39:25 - 39:29)
being said (39:27 - 39:32)
the DLC could add more starters I think (39:29 - 39:36)
I had more shirts at any moment (39:32 - 39:36)
they could yes they could push a random (39:36 - 39:40)
update and add more starters but this is (39:38 - 39:42)
not the Pokemon sleep team where they're (39:40 - 39:44)
pushing an update every five hours we (39:42 - 39:46)
maybe get an update once every like four (39:44 - 39:50)
months yeah it doesn't fix anything no (39:46 - 39:53)
um so uh (39:50 - 39:56)
there could be repeats of seven like I (39:53 - 39:57)
don't know what's happening this summer (39:56 - 40:02)
my assumption was that the first part of (39:57 - 40:04)
the DLC was supposed to come out this (40:02 - 40:07)
summer that DLC is a summer-based (40:04 - 40:10)
festival in Japan (40:07 - 40:12)
ironically worlds is like a Summer Event (40:10 - 40:16)
based Festival in Japan much like the (40:12 - 40:20)
Raffles we didn't get the DLC either (40:16 - 40:24)
so I would I would assume that ideally (40:20 - 40:27)
this would have lined up with rillaboom (40:24 - 40:29)
ending around the time the DLC should (40:27 - 40:31)
have been coming out (40:29 - 40:33)
that would have added more starters and (40:31 - 40:36)
then the Seven Star raids would have (40:33 - 40:39)
continued with whatever starters the DLC (40:36 - 40:40)
would have added I'm gonna take a wild (40:39 - 40:43)
guess and be like Blastoise and Venusaur (40:40 - 40:45)
because we already have Charizard and (40:43 - 40:47)
they can use Blastoise and Venusaur to (40:45 - 40:50)
easily sell DLC if there's one thing (40:47 - 40:53)
that Blastoise and Venusaur fans have in (40:50 - 40:54)
common is they're very mad that (40:53 - 40:57)
Charizard gets special treatment so uh (40:54 - 41:00)
they will gladly pay money for their two (40:57 - 41:02)
favorite Pokemon or whichever one they (41:00 - 41:05)
like more than Charizard so (41:02 - 41:08)
um I think that like seven star raids (41:05 - 41:11)
was their long-term starter plan people (41:08 - 41:14)
love starters they've done eight months (41:11 - 41:17)
of starters and seven star raids they've (41:14 - 41:21)
varied in popularity depending on (41:17 - 41:23)
like let's face it Greninja and (41:21 - 41:24)
Charizard are just incredibly popular (41:23 - 41:29)
right like I still stand by at least (41:24 - 41:31)
doing every single one of these raids on (41:29 - 41:32)
Twitch (41:31 - 41:35)
chestnuts seemed to be the flattest one (41:32 - 41:39)
and I mean we know that Chestnut is not (41:35 - 41:42)
I'm not hating on Chestnut yeah I don't (41:39 - 41:44)
like him we just know that Chestnut is (41:42 - 41:46)
not the most popular starter he's (41:44 - 41:49)
very I would assume Meganium would also (41:46 - 41:51)
rank pretty low again not hating a (41:49 - 41:53)
Meganium it's just we know based off (41:51 - 41:56)
polls and popularity numbers that these (41:53 - 41:58)
Pokemon always pull very poorly compared (41:56 - 41:59)
to (41:58 - 42:01)
Greninja and Charizard (41:59 - 42:03)
uh (42:01 - 42:05)
so (42:03 - 42:08)
we do know that there was (42:05 - 42:12)
a possibility of legendary raids mm-hmm (42:08 - 42:16)
um there was a data mine of (42:12 - 42:18)
and when I say there was a date of mine (42:16 - 42:20)
just because a Pokemon exists in the (42:18 - 42:22)
code it doesn't guarantee anything I (42:20 - 42:24)
want to be very clear that like Victini (42:22 - 42:28)
was technically in sword and shield code (42:24 - 42:31)
but there was no way to get Victini at (42:28 - 42:32)
all (42:31 - 42:36)
um so just to be very clear here like (42:32 - 42:38)
take the stuff with the small grain of (42:36 - 42:39)
salt I don't know why that's an (42:38 - 42:41)
expression but there's probably some (42:39 - 42:43)
lore behind it (42:41 - 42:44)
um (42:43 - 42:46)
so we know Mewtwo's in the code and (42:44 - 42:48)
there was uh there was information (42:46 - 42:50)
showing that Mewtwo would be in a raid (42:48 - 42:53)
but it was not catchable (42:50 - 42:55)
and if you brought a Mew the MU would (42:53 - 42:57)
get the mightiest Mark so your own Mew (42:55 - 42:59)
you brought would get the mightiest Mark (42:57 - 43:02)
if it fought against the Mewtwo your mu (42:59 - 43:05)
would also get a stat boost if it was (43:02 - 43:07)
brought to a meteor raid so that would (43:05 - 43:09)
maybe be the Assumption of what's coming (43:07 - 43:12)
next ironically they also added me too (43:09 - 43:15)
to Pokemon unite so that maybe kind of (43:12 - 43:17)
lines up a little bit sometimes there's (43:15 - 43:18)
some (43:17 - 43:22)
the lining up of their games sometimes (43:18 - 43:25)
sometimes they just randomly drop uh (43:22 - 43:27)
Team Rocket collection with no Rhyme or (43:25 - 43:29)
Reason who knows (43:27 - 43:32)
uh but (43:29 - 43:35)
we had legendary and mythical raids in (43:32 - 43:37)
sword and shield we had a Mewtwo one you (43:35 - 43:41)
could not catch it uh we had a zero or a (43:37 - 43:42)
one you could not catch it we had (43:41 - 43:45)
urshifu we had glass rear we had Specter (43:42 - 43:47)
you could not catch them (43:45 - 43:48)
um (43:47 - 43:50)
that being said the reward structure in (43:48 - 43:51)
this game has been better right like (43:50 - 43:53)
there wasn't that much incentive to do (43:51 - 43:55)
last year you couldn't catch it the (43:53 - 43:56)
rewards were pretty average it wasn't (43:55 - 43:58)
very hard because I think the max level (43:56 - 44:03)
for those like were what 65 70. (43:58 - 44:03)
um so (44:03 - 44:07)
I think the Mewtwo and sword and shield (44:05 - 44:10)
was e80 (44:07 - 44:12)
um and I think the Zara Aura was like (44:10 - 44:15)
one was 60 but the shiny one was like (44:12 - 44:17)
level 100. but the rewards weren't good (44:15 - 44:20)
I mean the reward was like do a hundred (44:17 - 44:22)
thousand zero Aura then we'll give you a (44:20 - 44:24)
shiny one for free through Pokemon home (44:22 - 44:28)
so so (44:24 - 44:30)
I would (44:28 - 44:33)
I would tend to lean to believe the the (44:30 - 44:35)
concept of this Mewtwo would not be (44:33 - 44:37)
catchable it would just be very hard if (44:35 - 44:38)
you brought him you would get a mighty (44:37 - 44:40)
Mark if you didn't bring him you you get (44:38 - 44:43)
you still get the rewards I I don't know (44:40 - 44:44)
um (44:43 - 44:46)
they've given away a lot of muse right (44:44 - 44:49)
if you bought pdsp you got a free Mew if (44:46 - 44:50)
you bought let's go Pikachu with the (44:49 - 44:52)
Pokeball you gotta free Mew if you go in (44:50 - 44:54)
Pokemon home right now or sorry Pokemon (44:52 - 44:56)
go right now and you spend the five (44:54 - 44:58)
dollars you get the ticket to get the (44:56 - 45:00)
shiny Mew if you already have if you (44:58 - 45:01)
can't see that ticket that means you (45:00 - 45:03)
already got the shiny Mew you probably (45:01 - 45:05)
also got a regular mute like they have (45:03 - 45:07)
given (45:05 - 45:11)
ways to get me recently (45:07 - 45:11)
um (45:11 - 45:13)
but I guess that's the whole point of (45:13 - 45:17)
mythical right mythical equals marketing (45:15 - 45:19)
they've marketed Mew quite a few times (45:17 - 45:21)
the last two years (45:19 - 45:23)
and then again (45:21 - 45:28)
well how old is let's go five years (45:23 - 45:28)
yep yeah so (45:29 - 45:32)
um (45:32 - 45:33)
I don't know what the rest of the summer (45:32 - 45:35)
is going to be because we're out of (45:33 - 45:37)
starters and I don't know if they're (45:35 - 45:38)
just gonna pop out like multiple (45:37 - 45:41)
legendary raids (45:38 - 45:41)
I mean there were also a lot of bugs (45:42 - 45:47)
Chestnut had a whole month before it (45:44 - 45:49)
because of all the bugs so their (45:47 - 45:51)
timeline was already at least a little (45:49 - 45:55)
off yep yeah I mean we're end of July (45:51 - 45:56)
though and now we're out of raids where (45:55 - 45:58)
if Chestnut didn't have a bug it would (45:56 - 45:59)
have probably we would have probably (45:58 - 46:01)
been caught up at the beginning of June (45:59 - 46:02)
and then like (46:01 - 46:05)
that made sense for a DLC for me is June (46:02 - 46:06)
I mean I guess it was like well though (46:05 - 46:08)
Chrome the Iowa armor came out I don't (46:06 - 46:11)
know like June July does make sense for (46:08 - 46:14)
a Summer Festival (46:11 - 46:14)
but they they also seems like I guess we (46:14 - 46:20)
didn't talk about this enough but like (46:19 - 46:22)
there was a point when like Charizard (46:20 - 46:26)
Greninja cinderace when they came they (46:22 - 46:29)
had like bonus raids with them (46:26 - 46:30)
it was like oh you could do like (46:29 - 46:33)
bronzong or floor just or mimikyu and (46:30 - 46:36)
then at a certain point they literally (46:33 - 46:37)
gave up on that yeah they were like no (46:36 - 46:39)
one's doing these did they make it all (46:37 - 46:41)
the way through all of the version (46:39 - 46:43)
exclusives because that was what those (46:41 - 46:45)
raids were mostly for was to help people (46:43 - 46:47)
get version exclusives if they don't (46:45 - 46:48)
know I'm not talking about version (46:47 - 46:49)
exclusives I'm talking about they would (46:48 - 46:52)
pair two Pokemon that were like okay (46:49 - 46:54)
counters against the Seven Stars so for (46:52 - 46:57)
Charizard it was like floor just and I (46:54 - 46:59)
think it was like mimikyu and then for (46:57 - 47:02)
cinderase it was like Gengar (46:59 - 47:06)
and like bronzong or something (47:02 - 47:08)
um and they did that for like the first (47:06 - 47:09)
three (47:08 - 47:12)
and then like they just they were like (47:09 - 47:15)
we're just we're not doing this anymore (47:12 - 47:16)
um (47:15 - 47:19)
and they only did (47:16 - 47:21)
well I guess the only Paradox that is (47:19 - 47:23)
version it is wait what were the no (47:21 - 47:24)
there's a lot of paradox Pokemon their (47:23 - 47:26)
version exclusive but I guess (47:24 - 47:29)
great Tuscan iron all the characters (47:26 - 47:34)
based off the same Pokemon (47:29 - 47:34)
yeah well other than the the Box Legends (47:34 - 47:39)
yeah (47:37 - 47:39)
yeah (47:39 - 47:45)
but there's like no equivalent to like (47:42 - 47:48)
Sandy shocks or flutter Maine or iron (47:45 - 47:51)
hands right like yeah the the great (47:48 - 47:53)
Tuscan iron Treads are the only one (47:51 - 47:56)
based off yeah Dawn fan yeah and they (47:53 - 48:00)
did that and that broke the game (47:56 - 48:00)
but yeah I think they've done all (48:00 - 48:05)
version exclusives right (48:02 - 48:08)
Armor's rule Edge which technically (48:05 - 48:10)
aren't really version exclusives because (48:08 - 48:14)
it was just item based um (48:10 - 48:15)
they made it through a good chunk of (48:14 - 48:16)
them at least I definitely wasn't (48:15 - 48:19)
keeping track like high Dragon (48:16 - 48:21)
Haxorus or whatever the other one was (48:19 - 48:24)
yeah (48:21 - 48:24)
yeah squeeze another one in more we had (48:31 - 48:36)
nothing last week they could have done (48:35 - 48:39)
another Blissey run (48:36 - 48:39)
yeah I I (48:41 - 48:46)
you know you want to talk about a game (48:44 - 48:47)
that has had (48:46 - 48:50)
not only a rocky launch but just bad (48:47 - 48:52)
luck (48:50 - 48:52)
still think of scarlet and violet very (48:54 - 48:59)
fondly I just don't pick it up unless (48:56 - 49:02)
there's a raid to do (48:59 - 49:06)
yeah I mean I play it a lot but or a (49:02 - 49:07)
mystery gift (49:06 - 49:08)
because they have been doing a lot of (49:07 - 49:12)
mystery gifts they have which which you (49:08 - 49:15)
know is (49:12 - 49:15)
good I mean like there's a lot of picnic (49:15 - 49:19)
stuff but there's also a lot of like (49:17 - 49:21)
items in between like shards or bottle (49:19 - 49:23)
caps and then (49:21 - 49:25)
uh unfortunately TMS because the TM (49:23 - 49:27)
machine is still bad (49:25 - 49:28)
um and then Pokemon I mean we're (49:27 - 49:31)
supposed to be getting a (49:28 - 49:33)
helic gastrodon because we're getting (49:31 - 49:37)
the 17th guests on this week (49:33 - 49:37)
I will be honest I'm at the point that I (49:38 - 49:47)
kind of resent having to go into scarlet (49:43 - 49:49)
and violet to redeem things I'm just (49:47 - 49:50)
like (49:49 - 49:53)
you don't want to open that game (49:50 - 49:55)
and open a better game (49:53 - 49:57)
and I'm on the other side where every (49:55 - 49:59)
time I go and open it to get a mystery (49:57 - 50:01)
gift I think hey maybe I should play (49:59 - 50:03)
through my Violet version because I (50:01 - 50:05)
never actually did that and I had (50:03 - 50:08)
another storyline to finish I am waiting (50:05 - 50:12)
till both DLCs are out because I redid (50:08 - 50:15)
sword after both DLCs out and that game (50:12 - 50:19)
felt so wild when they're like at level (50:15 - 50:21)
15. hey do you want to go to these other (50:19 - 50:22)
places (50:21 - 50:25)
can I do anything there (50:22 - 50:28)
sure I'll go heck yeah it so I'm curious (50:25 - 50:31)
to see I'm not gonna do it until (50:28 - 50:33)
everything's out and I can kind of get (50:31 - 50:35)
the experience of what (50:33 - 50:37)
and maybe the games will work better and (50:35 - 50:40)
I won't be so annoyed by them (50:37 - 50:44)
uh at that point because like (50:40 - 50:44)
I (50:45 - 50:48)
I like scarlet and violet that I keep (50:46 - 50:51)
going back to it I mean obviously like I (50:48 - 50:53)
play Pokemon for a living (50:51 - 50:55)
um and I'm very privileged to do that (50:53 - 50:57)
but like I have so many other games I (50:55 - 50:59)
can play like I don't have to play (50:57 - 51:01)
Scarlet but I can play bdsp I can play (50:59 - 51:03)
Legends I can play (51:01 - 51:06)
there's a lot you are not willingly (51:03 - 51:08)
playing those games (51:06 - 51:11)
there's a couple things in bdsp I gotta (51:08 - 51:13)
finish (51:11 - 51:15)
I got that shiny Shaman dog I really (51:13 - 51:16)
like in that (51:15 - 51:17)
um (51:16 - 51:19)
but like what's weird to me is like I (51:17 - 51:21)
think about scarlet and violet and I (51:19 - 51:23)
like the one thing that bothers me this (51:21 - 51:26)
is a bothers me personally is like I'm (51:23 - 51:27)
like (51:26 - 51:30)
I haven't got to master rank at all in (51:27 - 51:33)
Scarlet pilot and I was getting to (51:30 - 51:36)
master rank every single season in sword (51:33 - 51:38)
and shield (51:36 - 51:41)
and I I do like Dynamax more than I like (51:38 - 51:43)
to rationalization (51:41 - 51:45)
um at least in like (51:43 - 51:49)
at least in in a closed team Sheet like (51:45 - 51:51)
ladder kind of situation like dynamex is (51:49 - 51:54)
just way more predictable of like you're (51:51 - 51:55)
probably not going to dynamics that dust (51:54 - 51:57)
clops are you nah porygon2 is probably (51:55 - 51:59)
not Dynamics it's probably gonna be that (51:57 - 52:00)
red yellow key you brought whereas like (51:59 - 52:02)
terrestrialization and a closed team (52:00 - 52:05)
Sheet is really hard to be like one I (52:02 - 52:07)
don't know which one's gonna Trace size (52:05 - 52:09)
two I have no clue what to (52:07 - 52:11)
rationalization you have like it could (52:09 - 52:14)
be any of these 18 like (52:11 - 52:18)
um so I don't like it as much but like (52:14 - 52:18)
I would like to do competitive it's just (52:19 - 52:24)
the raid stuff because it requires more (52:22 - 52:27)
prep work than raids in sword and shield (52:24 - 52:30)
I find myself doing rate prep and I like (52:27 - 52:32)
doing that I like building Pokemon four (52:30 - 52:34)
raids I think that's really fun like I (52:32 - 52:36)
love doing that it's very time consuming (52:34 - 52:38)
and then (52:36 - 52:41)
like I feel like I am wasting more time (52:38 - 52:43)
exploring the world because everything's (52:41 - 52:45)
just so spread apart where I felt like (52:43 - 52:48)
in sword and shield I would explore the (52:45 - 52:50)
whole world within like 45 minutes and (52:48 - 52:51)
be like okay I picked up all my items I (52:50 - 52:54)
checked all my RAID ends I talked to the (52:51 - 52:58)
people who refresh every day once a day (52:54 - 53:00)
so I feel like (52:58 - 53:02)
I have more to do in scarlet and violet (53:00 - 53:05)
but scarlet and violet is using my time (53:02 - 53:08)
differently which is like restricting me (53:05 - 53:10)
from doing nothing like it's a good (53:08 - 53:13)
problem to have I guess (53:10 - 53:18)
like there is enough to do but also like (53:13 - 53:20)
I could easily go back to old Pokemon (53:18 - 53:21)
games and be like oh I forgot to do this (53:20 - 53:23)
I didn't do this like (53:21 - 53:25)
uh I don't know like I I know I see the (53:23 - 53:27)
complaint of like uh the only thing left (53:25 - 53:29)
to do in Scarlet Violet is right it's (53:27 - 53:31)
the only thing that brings me back it's (53:29 - 53:32)
literally what Hannah just said moments (53:31 - 53:34)
ago is like I'll only turn on the game (53:32 - 53:35)
for raids yeah (53:34 - 53:37)
you can turn the game on for raids you (53:35 - 53:38)
could turn the game on for shiny hunting (53:37 - 53:39)
you could turn the game on for (53:38 - 53:42)
competitive (53:39 - 53:44)
is there anything else you can really do (53:42 - 53:46)
like I guess finish your Pokedex but I'm (53:44 - 53:49)
assuming most people like that should be (53:46 - 53:51)
it's a Pokemon game you can always set (53:49 - 53:55)
your own Wild goal right yeah yeah yeah (53:51 - 53:55)
I think my biggest issue is my initial (53:56 - 54:03)
impression of it was so frustrating with (54:00 - 54:07)
how sort of clergy it is and the longer (54:03 - 54:10)
we go without ever really having a lot (54:07 - 54:12)
of the clutchiness fixed (54:10 - 54:16)
the less I'm like I just I don't I don't (54:12 - 54:19)
really want to jump into this (54:16 - 54:24)
time sync where I'm reminded of (54:19 - 54:27)
what I want it to be and how far we're (54:24 - 54:29)
not from like again we haven't seen (54:27 - 54:31)
substantial updates and they don't (54:29 - 54:33)
happen all that often and the ones when (54:31 - 54:35)
they were updating it was like oh we (54:33 - 54:37)
didn't really need that fix but I guess (54:35 - 54:40)
but like when I'm still doing raids and (54:37 - 54:44)
I'm still locked in three minutes of I (54:40 - 54:46)
have no idea what's happening and (54:44 - 54:48)
suddenly everybody around me is dead and (54:46 - 54:51)
so am I and I had no clue and that's we (54:48 - 54:52)
are (54:51 - 54:56)
many months into the life cycle of this (54:52 - 54:58)
game it is just (54:56 - 55:00)
emotionally it feels like going back to (54:58 - 55:02)
Twitter like emotionally I don't want to (55:00 - 55:06)
be here because I know what it could be (55:02 - 55:08)
and what it was and what your other (55:06 - 55:11)
games were and this ain't it and so it's (55:08 - 55:14)
really hard to be like okay so I'm not (55:11 - 55:16)
gonna spend a couple of hours making a (55:14 - 55:19)
Pokemon for this new raid for this new (55:16 - 55:20)
thing so that I could (55:19 - 55:23)
do it for a couple of hours and then (55:20 - 55:24)
I've made this Pokemon that may or may (55:23 - 55:27)
not even be applicable to anything else (55:24 - 55:29)
in the game or any other raid going (55:27 - 55:32)
forward like I'm making a one-off thing (55:29 - 55:36)
and it's weird in the fact that like (55:32 - 55:37)
when I look because people like well you (55:36 - 55:39)
do raids in Final Fantasy all the time (55:37 - 55:41)
like yeah but I'm always improving the (55:39 - 55:44)
one character the one thing that I am (55:41 - 55:47)
I'm always putting resources into that (55:44 - 55:50)
I'm making myself look like that thing (55:47 - 55:52)
and the weird thing for me with raids is (55:50 - 55:55)
I'm often building a Pokemon that I (55:52 - 55:57)
don't really care about that I have no (55:55 - 56:01)
attachment to just to get past this door (55:57 - 56:04)
and then I may never think of them again (56:01 - 56:07)
on the other hand though you're using (56:04 - 56:09)
Pokemon that you may otherwise never use (56:07 - 56:11)
you're getting a chance to invest in (56:09 - 56:13)
Pokemon and spend time with Pokemon that (56:11 - 56:15)
otherwise you may never even have put in (56:13 - 56:19)
a team and I'm really enjoying that for (56:15 - 56:23)
for one use like again I build it once (56:19 - 56:25)
and then I put it on the Shelf because (56:23 - 56:28)
the next rate that comes that is no (56:25 - 56:30)
longer applicable that doesn't apply (56:28 - 56:35)
at all and it's probably bad for it so (56:30 - 56:37)
I mean I know I know you're not like a (56:35 - 56:39)
shiny Hunter but like no that was it (56:37 - 56:41)
that was a shiny Hunter mentality of (56:39 - 56:43)
like and I I always hated my own twitch (56:41 - 56:45)
chat for doing that I would spend like (56:43 - 56:46)
two weeks looking for a Shiny Pokemon (56:45 - 56:48)
and we would get it and the first thing (56:46 - 56:50)
like a hundred people would say is like (56:48 - 56:52)
okay what's next like geez I haven't (56:50 - 56:55)
even we haven't even finished the (56:52 - 56:56)
registration part like we just caught it (56:55 - 56:59)
like calm down but like that is a shiny (56:56 - 57:01)
like it's not a Badman it's just a it's (56:59 - 57:03)
just a way of thinking of like okay I (57:01 - 57:04)
got it what's the next one okay I got it (57:03 - 57:07)
what's the next one but I I have seen a (57:04 - 57:09)
lot of people that like you know I try (57:07 - 57:11)
to recommend a lot of Pokemon every (57:09 - 57:12)
every time a raid comes through right (57:11 - 57:15)
like oh like for for real boom it was (57:12 - 57:16)
like iron hands and Chestnut or I'm (57:15 - 57:18)
sorry not just iron hands down and (57:16 - 57:20)
Dragonite and (57:18 - 57:23)
um uh what else did I recommend uh (57:20 - 57:25)
whatever you know I I recommended six (57:23 - 57:27)
Pokemon and so it's nice that people can (57:25 - 57:29)
look and be like oh I really like (57:27 - 57:31)
houndstone cool like that and then (57:29 - 57:32)
there's there's people that go like (57:31 - 57:34)
further of like oh not only do I like (57:32 - 57:35)
houndstone but like I want a shiny hun (57:34 - 57:38)
Hound stone or like oh cool I got a (57:35 - 57:40)
shiny iron hands a week ago I can use (57:38 - 57:43)
that here so there is like this (57:40 - 57:45)
I 100 get what you're saying Greg of (57:43 - 57:47)
like I don't wanna like I put all this (57:45 - 57:49)
energy into a Hound Stone and when's the (57:47 - 57:51)
next time I'm gonna use houndstone like (57:49 - 57:53)
it's just gonna sit in the box but (57:51 - 57:55)
I feel like that that they're solving (57:53 - 57:57)
that that has been a problem in past (57:55 - 57:59)
Pokemon games and they're they're like (57:57 - 58:01)
slowly solving that of like okay we're (57:59 - 58:03)
we're giving you things to do with these (58:01 - 58:06)
Pokemon that isn't just like okay cool I (58:03 - 58:07)
got the shiny I don't care about (58:06 - 58:10)
competitive I don't I just got it I (58:07 - 58:12)
don't again it's not a problem that (58:10 - 58:15)
there aren't things to do the problem is (58:12 - 58:19)
the emotional ties for me don't exist (58:15 - 58:21)
when I have to play the game this way (58:19 - 58:24)
I don't it's the same problem that I had (58:21 - 58:26)
with competitive it's the same problem I (58:24 - 58:27)
have with a lot of competitive things (58:26 - 58:31)
where if I don't have a connection to (58:27 - 58:32)
those Pokemon (58:31 - 58:37)
being forced to use them does not solve (58:32 - 58:39)
that issue for me being forced to be (58:37 - 58:41)
like oh well you've never used a Hound (58:39 - 58:44)
Stone before yeah for a reason I don't (58:41 - 58:47)
like it I don't like it I thought you (58:44 - 58:49)
were a dog person and every time I have (58:47 - 58:52)
to use it I'm reminded that the choice (58:49 - 58:56)
of me make doing this was really not my (58:52 - 58:57)
choice (58:56 - 59:00)
I didn't really have a lot of choice (58:57 - 59:03)
going into this I was forced to make (59:00 - 59:05)
this thing because the ones that I do (59:03 - 59:09)
like don't fit the mold and that is a me (59:05 - 59:11)
thing but that is a thing that exists (59:09 - 59:13)
and when I go in to do like gorilla boom (59:11 - 59:15)
raids where I'm like well I have to do (59:13 - 59:16)
it this weekend and unfortunately I'm (59:15 - 59:19)
busy so I'm doing it at like eight in (59:16 - 59:21)
the morning and who the heck knows is (59:19 - 59:23)
going to be on but it's the only time I (59:21 - 59:25)
have to do it and it's just going to be (59:23 - 59:27)
a nightmare (59:25 - 59:30)
that isn't that doesn't feel (59:27 - 59:34)
great it just feels like and now I'm (59:30 - 59:37)
doing this because it's a chore (59:34 - 59:39)
and that's my problem with like Animal (59:37 - 59:40)
Crossing it's also my problem with a lot (59:39 - 59:42)
of farms Sim games where I'm like I (59:40 - 59:44)
don't want to do my real chores look at (59:42 - 59:47)
my room it's chaos I don't want to have (59:44 - 59:50)
to do it in my fun time either (59:47 - 59:52)
hey there's a new Hello Kitty Animal (59:50 - 59:53)
Crossing game that's out on Apple arcade (59:52 - 59:56)
yeah I just saw that and I'm like boy no (59:53 - 59:59)
it people are (59:56 - 60:00)
anyways (59:59 - 60:02)
um yeah yeah I mean I I think that's (60:00 - 60:05)
just like (60:02 - 60:05)
I think that's just like raids (60:07 - 60:12)
I don't I don't think anyone sings raids (60:10 - 60:14)
are bad I'm just saying I think I think (60:12 - 60:17)
I think it is it is a it is a cool thing (60:14 - 60:19)
that they added yeah that isn't (60:17 - 60:21)
competitive that isn't like the battle (60:19 - 60:23)
tower because you can also argue Battle (60:21 - 60:25)
Towers competitive right like yeah you (60:23 - 60:28)
gotta build the team for that (60:25 - 60:29)
um (60:28 - 60:32)
but I don't like like what would what (60:29 - 60:33)
would what would you think like is (60:32 - 60:35)
contest the thing you're looking for (60:33 - 60:37)
like you can take your backs caliber (60:35 - 60:39)
into a contest because that's again yeah (60:37 - 60:40)
that is something you could do with the (60:39 - 60:43)
Pokemon that you connect with that (60:40 - 60:46)
is it raids or isn't competitive I I (60:43 - 60:49)
think if my initial (60:46 - 60:49)
experience with scarlet and violet had (60:50 - 60:56)
not been poor I wouldn't mind it's still (60:53 - 60:59)
feeling bad now and like I've I'm back (60:56 - 61:01)
playing sword and shield and I'm like (60:59 - 61:03)
well I can bring just about anything to (61:01 - 61:04)
most of these raids (61:03 - 61:07)
and yeah you can insert and shield you (61:04 - 61:09)
know it's fine and I can just be like (61:07 - 61:10)
this is what I've made and I'm gonna (61:09 - 61:12)
clear for some reason I'm gonna get my (61:10 - 61:15)
rewards I think (61:12 - 61:15)
having another raid experience in my (61:16 - 61:21)
life that (61:19 - 61:24)
I think is superior also negatively (61:21 - 61:27)
affects these (61:24 - 61:29)
where I'm here with uh skull and violet (61:27 - 61:32)
and Pokemon go as moderate experiences (61:29 - 61:34)
yeah so like I have a thing that I've (61:32 - 61:36)
now been playing this game for 10 years (61:34 - 61:39)
and I don't get tired of those raids and (61:36 - 61:40)
I don't get tired of those dungeons (61:39 - 61:43)
because I am getting things to build up (61:40 - 61:44)
the one character that I've heavily (61:43 - 61:46)
invested in and I have a huge story with (61:44 - 61:49)
and I think that disconnect for how I (61:46 - 61:53)
exist in games makes it hard for me to (61:49 - 61:55)
make an emotional leap to seven (61:53 - 61:57)
summarize and I think Seven Star rates (61:55 - 61:59)
are a great idea I think the raid system (61:57 - 62:02)
needs to stay through all of Pokemon I (61:59 - 62:04)
think it's great I just think this (62:02 - 62:06)
iteration of it and how it's currently (62:04 - 62:08)
implemented (62:06 - 62:10)
doesn't work for me I just cannot (62:08 - 62:14)
connect with it and I find it more (62:10 - 62:18)
annoying than fun (62:14 - 62:20)
um that is just me and is not in the (62:18 - 62:22)
condemnation of the Seven Star raid (62:20 - 62:26)
system it's just not it's just I like I (62:22 - 62:28)
have the ones that I like and I want to (62:26 - 62:31)
be able to use them to do difficult (62:28 - 62:33)
content and I can do that in a lot of (62:31 - 62:35)
other games I can do it in Masters I can (62:33 - 62:38)
do it in a lot of other ways but I can't (62:35 - 62:40)
hear and it's (62:38 - 62:43)
it's it's just building on a foundation (62:40 - 62:46)
of frustration that I really hope the (62:43 - 62:50)
DLC fixes right like the DLC (62:46 - 62:53)
really changed sword and shield (62:50 - 62:56)
for the better and I'm really hoping (62:53 - 62:57)
that (62:56 - 63:01)
these will be able to change my (62:57 - 63:04)
perceptions of scarlet and violet (63:01 - 63:06)
um because we're we're just not there (63:04 - 63:09)
yet for me and I I do I'm at the point (63:06 - 63:12)
of (63:09 - 63:14)
resentment when I have to go into that (63:12 - 63:17)
game (63:14 - 63:17)
Hannah did you enjoy your real boom (63:18 - 63:24)
I caught it I put it in the Box (63:21 - 63:27)
I enjoyed doing it fancy ball no I've (63:24 - 63:28)
been cashing them all in playing (63:27 - 63:34)
pokeballs sorry that luxury ball life (63:28 - 63:36)
I did the whole thing where all of my (63:34 - 63:38)
Pokemon are in playing pokeballs in this (63:36 - 63:41)
game except for the except for the ones (63:38 - 63:42)
that I had to get traded to me the (63:41 - 63:45)
Paradox I'm not alone in that like I I (63:42 - 63:47)
know a handful of people that they just (63:45 - 63:49)
want everything in a plane Pokeball (63:47 - 63:52)
I mean my favorite pokeballs are either (63:49 - 63:54)
friend balls or love balls and those are (63:52 - 63:57)
hard to get right now yeah they are so (63:54 - 63:59)
playing pokeballs it is (63:57 - 64:02)
uh speaking of hard to get (63:59 - 64:05)
it's hard for a lot of people to go to (64:02 - 64:08)
La it's not that hard (64:05 - 64:10)
it's expensive this is expensive but (64:08 - 64:12)

LA (66:03 - 66:08)
yeah if I if I was going to La for (66:05 - 66:10)

um yeah so if you're in that area it is (67:02 - 67:07)
it is it is there for pretty much the (67:05 - 67:10)

point is it it's pretty much once a year (67:47 - 67:54)
I guess yeah I'm sure I'll trust them to (67:50 - 67:56)
say annual I'm not paying attention (67:54 - 67:57)
uh (67:56 - 67:59)
uh we learned that the annual Pokemon (67:57 - 68:01)
yeah you know I trust poker Beach we (67:59 - 68:03)
learned that the annual Pokemon TCG (68:01 - 68:04)
promotion will start in Germany and (68:03 - 68:09)
Austria on July 27th UK on August 23rd (68:04 - 68:11)
um and then United States and other (68:09 - 68:13)
countries sometime in August I don't (68:11 - 68:15)
know if we have an exact date on that (68:13 - 68:17)
otherwise I'm sure this blog post has (68:15 - 68:19)
been updated (68:17 - 68:21)
uh we have seen the cards because (68:19 - 68:23)
they're out in Germany (68:21 - 68:26)
uh there will be 15 cards six Hollow (68:23 - 68:29)
featuring sprigatito Fuego quax Lisa (68:26 - 68:33)
Titan Pikachu and cloth as usual you (68:29 - 68:35)
will get a booster pack with each Happy (68:33 - 68:36)
Meal toy each booster pack comes with (68:35 - 68:39)
four promo cards one which is Hollow (68:36 - 68:42)
uh this year's toy will be match and (68:39 - 68:45)
battle like last year's toy it's it's (68:42 - 68:47)
not a good toy (68:45 - 68:49)
it's a bad boy as somebody who's gotten (68:47 - 68:52)
last year's it's a bad toy (68:49 - 68:55)
and then um you're pretty much getting a (68:52 - 68:58)
four card booster pack that's it (68:55 - 68:58)
the question is (68:59 - 69:04)
now that the Pokemon card (69:02 - 69:07)
boom is over (69:04 - 69:09)
uh (69:07 - 69:12)
is McDonald's going to be more lenient (69:09 - 69:14)
in just selling booster packs or are (69:12 - 69:16)
they going to force the Happy Meals (69:14 - 69:19)
which is their right to do (69:16 - 69:21)
it's their business they can do what (69:19 - 69:25)
they want but for two plus years (69:21 - 69:29)
maybe even longer honestly uh (69:25 - 69:31)
at least the McDonald's in the Midwest (69:29 - 69:33)
and boy did I go to a lot of McDonald's (69:31 - 69:37)
in the midwest uh they would not require (69:33 - 69:39)
you they they would be like hey for the (69:37 - 69:40)
Pokemon things you gotta buy the whole (69:39 - 69:42)
meal we're just not selling toys (69:40 - 69:44)
um and we obvi I think we all saw (69:42 - 69:46)
YouTube videos of (69:44 - 69:48)
people driving through the drive-through (69:46 - 69:51)
just buying uh you know a whole box of (69:48 - 69:53)
carpool yep car and they they they (69:51 - 69:55)
stopped that (69:53 - 69:57)
um (69:55 - 70:00)
I don't I don't know (69:57 - 70:04)
I I I I don't know if uh if that is a (70:00 - 70:07)
thing that I'll be interested to see if (70:04 - 70:10)
those videos happen again (70:07 - 70:10)
uh yeah yeah I mean I'm sure there will (70:12 - 70:20)
be one McDonald's out there where that (70:16 - 70:23)
that would happen (70:20 - 70:23)
uh the the very so when when Pokemon was (70:24 - 70:31)
at like Peak (70:28 - 70:33)
uh scalping (70:31 - 70:36)
the hollow Pikachu getting pulled out of (70:33 - 70:39)
the McDonald's set was getting pulled (70:36 - 70:42)
for about eighty dollars you would buy (70:39 - 70:43)
it (70:42 - 70:47)
um as of today that same Pikachu is (70:43 - 70:48)
worth (70:47 - 70:52)
nine dollars and Seventeen cents (70:48 - 70:56)
I remember Greg and I talking about PSA (70:52 - 70:59)
and Pokemon cards and very angry YouTube (70:56 - 71:00)
comments that probably subscribe to (70:59 - 71:04)
Twitter blue were uh yelling at us that (71:00 - 71:07)
we're wrong the card Market is only (71:04 - 71:10)
going to go up it's not going to crash (71:07 - 71:12)
what are you talking about you should (71:10 - 71:15)
definitely PSA all of your cards (71:12 - 71:18)
uh yeah how's that nine dollar Pikachu (71:15 - 71:20)
treating you yeah you should have sold (71:18 - 71:22)
it when it was 80. (71:20 - 71:24)
I don't know maybe that PSA 10 Pikachu (71:22 - 71:26)
is going for more than 80. who knows but (71:24 - 71:30)
also who is buying this (71:26 - 71:30)
deep rocket (71:30 - 71:33)
I feel like the TCG Market also other (71:36 - 71:43)
TCG news is the trick or trade booster (71:39 - 71:47)
bundle uh is back on Pokemon Center it's (71:43 - 71:50)
coming back yeah it's coming back (71:47 - 71:52)
they're doing new cards this year it's (71:50 - 71:56)
it's uh you will get 50 mini packs of (71:52 - 71:59)
TCG cards for twenty dollars each will (71:56 - 72:01)
contain three cards none of these cards (71:59 - 72:04)
are rare or sought after but they are (72:01 - 72:06)
they're I mean therefore trick or treat (72:04 - 72:09)
they are for you to give to kids or (72:06 - 72:12)
adults or anyone else under a mask to (72:09 - 72:15)
come up to your porch and uh you know (72:12 - 72:18)
give them some the Halloween cheer (72:15 - 72:23)
uh I I think I feel like the (72:18 - 72:26)
the TCG (72:23 - 72:30)
Space is really weird because (72:26 - 72:30)
they changed the booster packs (72:31 - 72:37)
and so like every booster pack is a (72:34 - 72:40)
hollow has at least one hollow rare (72:37 - 72:43)
um they got rid of like rainbow rares (72:40 - 72:47)
it seems like there's more balance in (72:43 - 72:50)
you know I this this is a very (72:47 - 72:53)
small sample and full disclosure to the (72:50 - 72:56)
Pokemon company sent me a booster box of (72:53 - 72:58)
obsidian flame and they sent me a (72:56 - 73:00)
booster box of palde evolved and they (72:58 - 73:01)
sent me a booster box of sword and (73:00 - 73:02)
shield (73:01 - 73:05)
36 packs in a booster box right and in (73:02 - 73:07)
all three of those I've had exactly 12 (73:05 - 73:10)
hits a hit would be like (73:07 - 73:13)
the ex or full art or secret rare or (73:10 - 73:15)
whatever right so that means one out of (73:13 - 73:17)
three booster packs (73:15 - 73:20)
12 divided by 36 one out of three is is (73:17 - 73:23)
a hit which is on average what most (73:20 - 73:26)
people are experiencing (73:23 - 73:28)
um (73:26 - 73:32)
so there seems to be (73:28 - 73:32)
a balance of some sort I don't want to (73:32 - 73:37)
say quality control because boy half of (73:36 - 73:39)
my cards are not even close to being (73:37 - 73:42)
centered but that's its own issue (73:39 - 73:43)
um (73:42 - 73:45)
and I feel like I see this uh this (73:43 - 73:49)
conversation that's happening of like (73:45 - 73:51)
well nothing is really expensive in any (73:49 - 73:54)
of these sets like the most expensive (73:51 - 73:56)
card I think in (73:54 - 73:59)
how they evolved is like e uh iono or (73:56 - 74:02)
whatever and she's like 80 bucks (73:59 - 74:03)
I mean (74:02 - 74:06)
she was very expensive obviously back in (74:03 - 74:08)
Japan and then obviously more people got (74:06 - 74:09)
their hands on sets and it was easier to (74:08 - 74:11)
get we are we know we know this right (74:09 - 74:13)
like if you if you get the cards like a (74:11 - 74:15)
month before everyone of course it's (74:13 - 74:16)
going to be more expensive because (74:15 - 74:17)
you're like one of five people that have (74:16 - 74:18)
it (74:17 - 74:22)
so in past sets (74:18 - 74:23)
um (74:22 - 74:26)
you would see multiple cards like uh (74:23 - 74:28)
evolving Skies is a really good example (74:26 - 74:31)
evolving Skies that had the Rayquaza it (74:28 - 74:34)
had the Leafeon it had the Umbreon all (74:31 - 74:35)
of these cards were like 200 plus (74:34 - 74:37)
dollars I think geez I think that (74:35 - 74:40)
Umbreon is like 600 now after market I (74:37 - 74:44)
think that Leafeon is like 250 right (74:40 - 74:46)
there's so many conversations to be had (74:44 - 74:48)
here like as a person (74:46 - 74:52)
if as a kid right like let's start let's (74:48 - 74:54)
start off with 10 year old Steve I (74:52 - 74:57)
didn't know the value of Pokemon cards I (74:54 - 75:00)
just wanted one of every card right and (74:57 - 75:02)
I wanted to put them in order in my (75:00 - 75:04)
binder and sometimes when I was bored I (75:02 - 75:06)
would put them in Pokedex order and then (75:04 - 75:08)
sometimes I would put them back in card (75:06 - 75:11)
order we have all done this you know (75:08 - 75:14)
that's a thing like like Ivysaur comes (75:11 - 75:18)
after Vena right I sorted them into (75:14 - 75:20)
types first and then Pokedex order (75:18 - 75:24)
so as an adult was that which with a lot (75:20 - 75:27)
more money than I had as a kid (75:24 - 75:30)
ideally you would think (75:27 - 75:33)
you would think that completing a (75:30 - 75:35)
Pokemon set as an adult would be (75:33 - 75:38)
significantly easier I'm gonna buy I'm (75:35 - 75:40)
gonna buy a booster box that's like a (75:38 - 75:44)
hundred bucks maybe 120 I get open 36 (75:40 - 75:47)
packs that's fun we all like opening (75:44 - 75:49)
packs opening packs is fun we're gonna (75:47 - 75:51)
slide them into my binder we're gonna be (75:49 - 75:53)
we're gonna trade some of our extras (75:51 - 75:56)
maybe we'll buy a couple more packs at (75:53 - 75:58)
Target (75:56 - 75:58)
we're done we complete that doesn't (75:58 - 76:03)
happen that doesn't happen because what (76:01 - 76:06)
happens is you buy a booster box you (76:03 - 76:08)
realize that you haven't even come close (76:06 - 76:11)
to completing the set maybe you buy a (76:08 - 76:13)
booster box maybe you buy a couple of (76:11 - 76:15)
singles you're still not close to (76:13 - 76:16)
completing the set (76:15 - 76:19)
and then you're like well I guess I'm (76:16 - 76:21)
never completing evolving skies because (76:19 - 76:23)
who in their right mind wants to spend (76:21 - 76:26)
six hundred dollars on an Umbreon to (76:23 - 76:28)
slide into this booster like that's it (76:26 - 76:32)
like it's it's impossible (76:28 - 76:35)
at least in the sword and shield era to (76:32 - 76:37)
complete a set (76:35 - 76:40)
it without just dropping like two (76:37 - 76:43)
thousand dollars like Umbreon is one (76:40 - 76:44)
expensive card (76:43 - 76:46)
Umbreon (76:44 - 76:49)
Rayquaza uh Leafeon like you're at like (76:46 - 76:51)
a thousand dollars at that point for (76:49 - 76:54)
three cards and like (76:51 - 76:57)
there are some TCG people that do care (76:54 - 76:58)
about money (76:57 - 77:00)
whether that's a business or whether (76:58 - 77:03)
they just like having expensive things (77:00 - 77:05)
and maybe they only want the Umbreon (77:03 - 77:06)
right they don't care about anything (77:05 - 77:08)
else in evolving Skies they don't care (77:06 - 77:09)
about the Rayquaza they don't care about (77:08 - 77:12)
the Leafeon they just want the umbrella (77:09 - 77:13)
I get it (77:12 - 77:16)
but like there's this weird disconnect (77:13 - 77:18)
of (77:16 - 77:20)
I want to collect Pokemon cards because (77:18 - 77:22)
it's a hobby but if I can't complete the (77:20 - 77:25)
set what's the point (77:22 - 77:28)
like if I live if I buy a booster box (77:25 - 77:31)
I'm not even getting half of the the (77:28 - 77:33)
cards I need and now with scarlet and (77:31 - 77:35)
violet it seems like they made like they (77:33 - 77:38)
turned this weird dial with scarlet and (77:35 - 77:39)
violet where (77:38 - 77:42)
it seems realistic now it seems like oh (77:39 - 77:45)
I could actually maybe complete this set (77:42 - 77:48)
but by turning that dial it's like none (77:45 - 77:52)
of these cards are 200 or 300 or 600 (77:48 - 77:54)
anymore so (77:52 - 77:58)
I think that is a good I know people are (77:54 - 78:00)
gonna hate me saying this I I already (77:58 - 78:02)
feel the comments coming I think that (78:00 - 78:05)
that is a good thing for the pure fact (78:02 - 78:09)
of collecting and finishing a set for (78:05 - 78:11)
somebody who wants to collect or even (78:09 - 78:14)
trade I think that's good (78:11 - 78:17)
You could argue well that's bad for like (78:14 - 78:20)
I don't have a super valuable card at (78:17 - 78:22)
that point I don't have a 600 card but (78:20 - 78:23)
like (78:22 - 78:27)
why would the Pokemon company care they (78:23 - 78:29)
don't make money from you selling a sick (78:27 - 78:31)
they don't care they don't care like (78:29 - 78:35)
that benefits them in no ways like if if (78:31 - 78:37)
you feel like you're getting better (78:35 - 78:41)
pulls or you feel like it is more like (78:37 - 78:44)
going into a paldea evolves I can (78:41 - 78:45)
remember the set and being like the only (78:44 - 78:49)
thing I want is iono and (78:45 - 78:52)
I can't buy her because she's let's just (78:49 - 78:55)
say she's 600 I can't I can't spend 600 (78:52 - 78:58)
on a card but I've heard that it's (78:55 - 79:01)
easier to pull her so I'm more willing (78:58 - 79:03)
to go to Target and buy a booster like (79:01 - 79:06)
it does benefit the Pokemon company more (79:03 - 79:09)
than it benefits resellers (79:06 - 79:11)
like (79:09 - 79:13)
we just talked about this Pikachu card (79:11 - 79:15)
at McDonald's like like resellers are (79:13 - 79:19)
not our friends like the people driving (79:15 - 79:21)
these card prices up are are not (79:19 - 79:23)
benefiting the people who just want to I (79:21 - 79:25)
don't know I think there's a complicated (79:23 - 79:27)
conversation there of like what is the (79:25 - 79:28)
right (79:27 - 79:31)
level on the dial of like they should (79:28 - 79:34)
feel somewhat valuable but also (79:31 - 79:35)
shouldn't be (79:34 - 79:38)
unobtained like completely unattainable (79:35 - 79:42)
like putting a hundred dollars into a (79:38 - 79:43)
hobby every three months even if you (79:42 - 79:45)
only buy (79:43 - 79:47)
one booster box every three months (79:45 - 79:49)
that's that's still a lot of money for a (79:47 - 79:51)
hobby like card collecting is a pretty (79:49 - 79:53)
expensive like Greg can speak to this (79:51 - 79:56)
for magic like magic comes like and and (79:53 - 79:58)
here's the thing with Pokemon cards if (79:56 - 80:01)
you really do care about the value (79:58 - 80:03)
the thing that is the thing that is on (80:01 - 80:05)
your side is time (80:03 - 80:08)
the older these cards get well with the (80:05 - 80:10)
exception of that Pikachu but like (80:08 - 80:13)
like a lot of cards with very few (80:10 - 80:15)
exceptions are worth a ton of money (80:13 - 80:18)
right out the gate like time is what (80:15 - 80:20)
adds to these like just look at my (80:18 - 80:23)
ancient Mew I'm gonna be able to buy a (80:20 - 80:25)
college campus with my ancient Mew (80:23 - 80:28)
because it is appreciating so much in (80:25 - 80:30)
value next to my Burger King gold coins (80:28 - 80:32)
like you just gotta let it simmer a (80:30 - 80:35)
little bit yeah for (80:32 - 80:38)
probably three or four centuries because (80:35 - 80:39)
then it'll be really worth something at (80:38 - 80:41)
that point when somebody digs it up (80:39 - 80:42)
they're like look at this Relic from the (80:41 - 80:47)
past it was an ancient Mew (80:42 - 80:47)
I think I think I think cards are in (80:48 - 80:52)
really weird places if the too long (80:50 - 80:54)
didn't read is like the card economy is (80:52 - 80:55)
in a really weird place right now (80:54 - 80:59)
because the scarlet and violet sets are (80:55 - 81:01)
different there's no I mean visually (80:59 - 81:02)
they're different they got rid of the (81:01 - 81:05)
gold borders they're not silver but (81:02 - 81:07)
they changed something and so I don't (81:05 - 81:09)
know what the long-term effect of that (81:07 - 81:12)
is I mean I think every card everything (81:09 - 81:16)
is reeling from what happened over covid (81:12 - 81:18)
and (81:16 - 81:22)
like magic just keeps pumping out sets (81:18 - 81:23)
despite (81:22 - 81:25)
literally everybody in their customer (81:23 - 81:28)
base saying (81:25 - 81:33)
stop please stop this is way too much (81:28 - 81:35)
that one man got them a lot of attention (81:33 - 81:38)
though it did it were yeah that worked (81:35 - 81:39)
but (81:38 - 81:43)
there are so many small stores that are (81:39 - 81:45)
have been telling their customers we are (81:43 - 81:47)
not (81:45 - 81:51)
getting that set in because (81:47 - 81:54)
we just paid two thousand dollars for (81:51 - 81:56)
the last set and we haven't sold through (81:54 - 81:59)
that stock and we don't have the margins (81:56 - 82:01)
to pay another two thousand dollars for (81:59 - 82:04)
another set of cards that will not be (82:01 - 82:06)
sold through and then we'll just have (82:04 - 82:08)
things because they keep coming out with (82:06 - 82:10)
something new and the next thing and so (82:08 - 82:13)
in order there are breaks that they have (82:10 - 82:15)
to buy to make it worthwhile to get (82:13 - 82:16)
discounts and they're like it's not (82:15 - 82:19)
worth it to buy one box (82:16 - 82:22)
but I can't keep investing so we're (82:19 - 82:25)
doing every third set and so people are (82:22 - 82:27)
not going to their local same Source (82:25 - 82:30)
they're going to Amazon and Amazon (82:27 - 82:33)
can really be dicey when you buy Cards (82:30 - 82:38)
so I think just across the board (82:33 - 82:38)
cards are in a weird place because (82:38 - 82:43)
everybody still has fresh memories of (82:40 - 82:45)
the card craze and we're like that ended (82:43 - 82:48)
we're not there anymore (82:45 - 82:51)
we're done you know and top of inflation (82:48 - 82:54)
like oh yeah go going back to we started (82:51 - 82:55)
with McDonald's going back to McDonald's (82:54 - 82:58)
it's like 14 for a meal at McDonald's (82:55 - 83:02)
now I (82:58 - 83:02)
like 10 like 10 bucks hmm (83:03 - 83:09)
like yeah I use the app I'm a smart (83:06 - 83:11)
Shopper you know you get that 20 piece (83:09 - 83:13)
nugget for five dollars right like I I (83:11 - 83:16)
know what I'm doing but like (83:13 - 83:16)
like (83:16 - 83:21)
when McDonald's is getting expensive you (83:19 - 83:23)
know something's wrong (83:21 - 83:25)
um (83:23 - 83:27)
I mean like during the time where the (83:25 - 83:29)
card stuff was out of control the (83:27 - 83:31)
Pokemon Center I don't know if people (83:29 - 83:33)
remember this the Pokemon Center used to (83:31 - 83:36)
have really cool packaging tape it would (83:33 - 83:38)
be like Pikachu like wearing a little (83:36 - 83:40)
outfit and then that would be how they (83:38 - 83:43)
taped up the boxes and because it was (83:40 - 83:48)
solely because of TCG cards that if a (83:43 - 83:52)
scalper or a thief or whatever you be or (83:48 - 83:54)
the UPS man didn't get their paycheck (83:52 - 83:57)
for the week if they saw the Pikachu (83:54 - 84:00)
tape that would be stolen like that (83:57 - 84:02)
would be the package being open because (84:00 - 84:04)
they knew that there was a high (84:02 - 84:07)
likelihood of cards in there and cards (84:04 - 84:10)
were at a hall time high like that was (84:07 - 84:12)
like Vivid voltage and all that stuff (84:10 - 84:15)
and the Pokemon company literally had to (84:12 - 84:16)
there is no tape anyway you just get (84:15 - 84:19)
generic round tape because of the card (84:16 - 84:22)
phase that that was awesome (84:19 - 84:25)
cool packaging we don't get the fancy (84:22 - 84:28)
tape anymore y'all ruin this take your (84:25 - 84:29)
99. (84:28 - 84:33)
you ain't getting anything else (84:29 - 84:33)
um that's our that's that's all we got (84:34 - 84:37)
for our show (84:35 - 84:39)
um I I don't know oh here's here's what (84:37 - 84:40)
