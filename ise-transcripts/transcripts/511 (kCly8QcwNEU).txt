super effective i'm your host sbj steve (0:28 - 0:34)
with you here today is greg hello i'm (0:31 - 0:36)
back from pax (0:34 - 0:40)
the past it was very exciting the pax (0:36 - 0:42)
to the person that shouted my name at (0:40 - 0:43)
night on the bridge (0:42 - 0:46)
i know i waved at you (0:43 - 0:48)
i could not clearly see you so i'm still (0:46 - 0:51)
not a hundred percent sure who you were (0:48 - 0:53)
if you want to reach out to me i'll say (0:51 - 0:56)
hi officially but i did wave (0:53 - 0:57)
so (0:56 - 1:00)
i kind of covered it but i'll be honest (0:57 - 1:03)
could not could not tell who you were is (1:00 - 1:05)
it that bridge that goes from where the (1:03 - 1:06)
little train lets you off to the (1:05 - 1:08)
convention center yeah (1:06 - 1:11)
south station (1:08 - 1:11)
enthusiastic waving uh while you guys (1:11 - 1:16)
were in the on the east coast enjoying (1:13 - 1:18)
yourselves i was learning many new facts (1:16 - 1:20)
about the universe and the world from (1:18 - 1:21)
tiktok (1:20 - 1:22)
oh (1:21 - 1:24)
excellent (1:22 - 1:26)
got it (1:24 - 1:28)
we have quite a bit of news to get (1:26 - 1:30)
through and we are (1:28 - 1:32)
not in the studio like last week (1:30 - 1:34)
although there were a bunch of comments (1:32 - 1:36)
so thank you for commenting some people (1:34 - 1:38)
liked it i think the majority people (1:36 - 1:40)
liked it um (1:38 - 1:41)
i (1:40 - 1:43)
wish the lighting was better (1:41 - 1:46)
and i wish the video quality was a (1:43 - 1:48)
little bit better and i don't know what (1:46 - 1:51)
liberties we have in (1:48 - 1:53)
or what says we have and that kind of (1:51 - 1:55)
stuff but (1:53 - 1:57)
uh i think there's some other stuff in (1:55 - 1:59)
minnesota we can also try out so we'll (1:57 - 2:00)
we'll keep our eyes out (1:59 - 2:02)
we're still trying new stuff i liked (2:00 - 2:05)
being in person i wasn't a fan of the (2:02 - 2:07)
switching camera thing though (2:05 - 2:11)
yeah i think the one thing i've seen in (2:07 - 2:13)
other video podcasts or other interview (2:11 - 2:15)
shows i guess is there's usually a main (2:13 - 2:17)
camera that shows everyone (2:15 - 2:18)
yeah (2:17 - 2:21)
and that's like nice at times (2:18 - 2:23)
um and i don't think there's a main (2:21 - 2:26)
camera that shows everyone (2:23 - 2:27)
so (2:26 - 2:29)
uh (2:27 - 2:31)

let's not distract um (7:27 - 7:34)
speaking of game updates this was (7:29 - 7:38)
actually wild to wake up to oh dear oh i (7:34 - 7:39)
know what you're talking about (7:38 - 7:42)
pokemon unite no that's not what i was (7:39 - 7:45)
thinking of oh okay pokemon unite (7:42 - 7:48)
reveals an in-game subscriptions service (7:45 - 7:51)
uh yeah this this was like literally two (7:48 - 7:54)
hours ago that they announced this (7:51 - 7:56)
timmy studio so there's actually two (7:54 - 7:59)
bits of news in this news (7:56 - 8:00)
the first bit is (7:59 - 8:02)
timmy studios (8:00 - 8:03)
has (8:02 - 8:05)
unveiled a new in-game subscription for (8:03 - 8:07)
pokemon unite (8:05 - 8:10)
and the second bit of news here is the (8:07 - 8:11)
this is off nintendo life they say the (8:10 - 8:15)
hugely popular moba recently surpassed (8:11 - 8:17)
70 million downloads (8:15 - 8:18)
which (8:17 - 8:21)
that doesn't say active players but (8:18 - 8:24)
last week we talked about how masters (8:21 - 8:26)
hit 40 million downloads (8:24 - 8:28)
and masters has been out a whole lot (8:26 - 8:32)
longer yeah than unite (8:28 - 8:32)
um so this is called the pokemon unite (8:33 - 8:38)
membership this scam i mean the scheme (8:35 - 8:40)
will give players monthly rewards for (8:38 - 8:43)
signing up for the service don't worry (8:40 - 8:45)
unite will remain free to play (8:43 - 8:47)
uh and the rewards for now are mostly (8:45 - 8:50)
cosmetic and costumes and some extra (8:47 - 8:52)
currency will be handed out (8:50 - 8:56)
uh we have the first month here (8:52 - 8:58)
which has which is uh (8:56 - 9:01)
1150 yen (8:58 - 9:03)
uh which i believe is about nine dollars (9:01 - 9:05)
for us 8.95 (9:03 - 9:07)
freedom units (9:05 - 9:10)
a special hollow wear of the month (9:07 - 9:13)
two free license trials (9:10 - 9:16)

a reward for signing up you will also (9:31 - 9:35)
get a fashion set designed around the (9:33 - 9:37)
mythical pokemon hoopa (9:35 - 9:39)
uh and nintendo i'm not seeing it but (9:37 - 9:41)
nintendo life says it's very cute and (9:39 - 9:42)
adorable (9:41 - 9:45)
the membership will cost 11.50 yen which (9:42 - 9:49)
is nine dollars which is a 7.15 (9:45 - 9:53)
uh europe l things i think euros so the (9:49 - 9:55)
official pricing is uh has not been (9:53 - 9:57)
outside we also do not know when the (9:55 - 9:58)
service will launch i'm going to assume (9:57 - 10:00)
the service is going to launch on like (9:58 - 10:01)
may 1st or something because that's when (10:00 - 10:03)
the season resets (10:01 - 10:05)
well i mean i'm on cerebe so ceremony (10:03 - 10:06)
says there's going to be a new event (10:05 - 10:09)
mission on april 28th (10:06 - 10:11)
uh there's a new battle pass which which (10:09 - 10:12)
they did the trailer for which is very (10:11 - 10:15)
cool that uh focuses on blastoise and (10:12 - 10:17)
charizard the trailer if you haven't (10:15 - 10:19)
watched it is great it's all cherry (10:17 - 10:21)
blossom themed (10:19 - 10:22)
um (10:21 - 10:25)
new flower collecting task thing uh (10:22 - 10:27)
which will give hollywood for elder (10:25 - 10:30)
glass and treven it and then may 7th (10:27 - 10:32)
uh will be a two day event known as (10:30 - 10:35)
pokemon united day so i imagine after (10:32 - 10:38)
that pokemon unite event would probably (10:35 - 10:40)
be the subscription um (10:38 - 10:42)
so like may 9th is what my guess is (10:40 - 10:44)
judging by how they like layer things (10:42 - 10:46)
over which games don't have a (10:44 - 10:50)
subscription pokemon go doesn't it yeah (10:46 - 10:51)
that is the super that is the actual (10:50 - 10:53)
news how pokemon go has made it this (10:51 - 10:55)
long without a subscription (10:53 - 10:56)
does (10:55 - 10:59)
remix cafe remix have a subscription no (10:56 - 11:00)
so it's just pokemon masters and now (10:59 - 11:03)
pokemon unite (11:00 - 11:04)
well masters doesn't have like a (11:03 - 11:06)
subscription (11:04 - 11:08)
master doesn't have a subscription no (11:06 - 11:10)
they they haven't missed that they kind (11:08 - 11:12)
of have kind of they kind of do they (11:10 - 11:14)
have like this box thing you can buy (11:12 - 11:17)
that gives you gems every day (11:14 - 11:18)
they're like like it's like a login (11:17 - 11:19)
bonus (11:18 - 11:20)
um (11:19 - 11:22)
i wouldn't really consider a (11:20 - 11:23)
subscription (11:22 - 11:25)
so it just like gives you more rewards (11:23 - 11:26)
every day you log in for like two weeks (11:25 - 11:29)
the pokemon 4d chess (11:26 - 11:32)
did offer that had a subscription like a (11:29 - 11:33)
month before they cancelled it (11:32 - 11:36)
completely yeah and the pokemon dual (11:33 - 11:40)
subscription was like 21 a month yeah it (11:36 - 11:44)
was unreal yeah and i only downloaded (11:40 - 11:47)
duel because i was so curious about the (11:44 - 11:50)
subscription which is a weird reason to (11:47 - 11:52)
download the game but i was like (11:50 - 11:55)
this subscription is 21 a month what can (11:52 - 11:59)
it possibly offer like what is it like (11:55 - 12:01)
i wanted to know as just a normal (11:59 - 12:03)
person (12:01 - 12:05)
that might like dual spoiler i didn't (12:03 - 12:07)
like dual like (12:05 - 12:08)
is this even fair to somebody who's (12:07 - 12:10)
obsessed with this game and it was it (12:08 - 12:12)
was not (12:10 - 12:13)
um (12:12 - 12:15)
so i i can go either two ways on the (12:13 - 12:19)
unite news like 70 million downloads (12:15 - 12:22)
unite still seems to be be pretty (12:19 - 12:24)
healthy when it comes to like finding a (12:22 - 12:25)
match (12:24 - 12:27)
so does this mean like united is still (12:25 - 12:29)
doing fine and they're just this is just (12:27 - 12:30)
another thing they're doing or does this (12:29 - 12:32)
mean united is doing bad and they're (12:30 - 12:34)
trying to get they're trying to get more (12:32 - 12:36)
money out of it like yeah dual situation (12:34 - 12:38)
it was it was clearly bad yeah i'm (12:36 - 12:40)
forecasting from past events clearly (12:38 - 12:42)
unite will be ending within the next six (12:40 - 12:44)
months because once they launch a (12:42 - 12:45)
subscription they're just trying to grab (12:44 - 12:47)
as much money as they can before they (12:45 - 12:50)
turn off the servers (12:47 - 12:50)
i don't know i think unite's still doing (12:51 - 12:54)
good well i think it's still doing well (12:52 - 12:57)
i'm curious if (12:54 - 12:59)
so you get (12:57 - 13:01)
40 gems a day right (12:59 - 13:04)
for how how long a month (13:01 - 13:06)
it says a month here yeah it says a (13:04 - 13:08)
month (13:06 - 13:08)
so (13:08 - 13:10)
[Music] (13:09 - 13:12)
let's just say that that's roughly 30 (13:10 - 13:15)
days let's average it out right (13:12 - 13:21)
that's uh 1200 gems uh-huh (13:15 - 13:24)
in game currency for uh (13:21 - 13:26)
1 (13:24 - 13:31)
220 gems is 19.99 (13:26 - 13:31)
so if you get this for 8.95 (13:33 - 13:37)
at the end of it you'll still it'll come (13:38 - 13:41)
out way ahead and gems alone my (13:39 - 13:44)
assumption is you need to log in to get (13:41 - 13:46)
the 40 gems (13:44 - 13:48)
yeah but if you're subscribed wouldn't (13:46 - 13:49)
you why would you be logging in every (13:48 - 13:51)
day (13:49 - 13:53)
look i have a lot of (13:51 - 13:54)
battle pa like i i've purchased the (13:53 - 13:56)
battle pass to apex it doesn't mean i (13:54 - 13:58)
log into apex every day but that's not a (13:56 - 14:00)
description yeah it's just a script so (13:58 - 14:02)
i'm curious how that's going to work (14:00 - 14:04)
like if you have to be logged in you (14:02 - 14:07)
have to get in every day to get your 40 (14:04 - 14:09)
gems (14:07 - 14:12)
or if it's just like (14:09 - 14:14)
gonna accrue i would imagine you have to (14:12 - 14:16)
you'd have to log in every day right (14:14 - 14:18)
otherwise you miss your opportunity for (14:16 - 14:20)
gems that day yeah if you're saying it's (14:18 - 14:23)
20 for 1200 gems or in the subscription (14:20 - 14:25)
it's let's just say 10 for the same (14:23 - 14:27)
amount i guarantee you they want you to (14:25 - 14:29)
log in every day yeah because i mean (14:27 - 14:32)
it's probably like 9.9 10 so it is (14:29 - 14:34)
ten dollars left (14:32 - 14:38)
like i think they're making (14:34 - 14:38)
like (14:39 - 14:43)
i wouldn't say it's because of what (14:41 - 14:45)
they're giving away i don't i feel like (14:43 - 14:46)
it's not so much that the game is in (14:45 - 14:50)
trouble i think they're trying to (14:46 - 14:53)
find a way to generate (14:50 - 14:54)
steady (14:53 - 14:56)
reliable money because what's more (14:54 - 14:57)
reliable (14:56 - 15:00)
yeah you for you people forget about it (14:57 - 15:01)
right until it's like oh that showed up (15:00 - 15:02)
on my (15:01 - 15:04)
statement oh i should cancel it but now (15:02 - 15:06)
i got 30 days using the subscription is (15:04 - 15:08)
going to order a new (15:06 - 15:10)
oh yeah like a battle pass you have to (15:08 - 15:13)
go in and buy it (15:10 - 15:14)
that's the word of subscription that's (15:13 - 15:16)
what subscription means that it keeps (15:14 - 15:18)
going yeah (15:16 - 15:20)
it's not a one and done not it would not (15:18 - 15:23)
be a one and done that would be foolish (15:20 - 15:24)
it's just weird that the subscription (15:23 - 15:27)
would be mid month but maybe that's on (15:24 - 15:29)
purpose (15:27 - 15:29)
to (15:29 - 15:31)
offset the battle pass (15:29 - 15:32)
probably (15:31 - 15:33)
because they don't want you to think (15:32 - 15:36)
like oh it's battle pass time (15:33 - 15:38)
i'm going to cancel the subscription (15:36 - 15:39)
right and they want they probably want (15:38 - 15:42)
the battle pass to start so you buy pay (15:39 - 15:44)
gems for the battle pass and then the (15:42 - 15:45)
subscription to start after that where (15:44 - 15:47)
you're getting free gems but i mean (15:45 - 15:49)
after the first month that (15:47 - 15:51)
that becomes irrelevant because people (15:49 - 15:53)
can sign up for the subscription at any (15:51 - 15:54)
point (15:53 - 15:55)
and then it will renew from whatever (15:54 - 15:57)
date they signed up (15:55 - 15:59)
and then the battle pass will always be (15:57 - 16:01)
a static date (15:59 - 16:01)
it is very interesting news i don't know (16:02 - 16:08)
how i feel about it i mean i feel (16:04 - 16:08)
the gems alone are probably worth it but (16:08 - 16:15)
i i know i don't log into that game (16:12 - 16:16)
every day and i know i'm not going to (16:15 - 16:19)
log into that game every day so i like i (16:16 - 16:22)
think you have to sort of balance out (16:19 - 16:24)
what is your actual (16:22 - 16:26)
interest (16:24 - 16:28)
and is it if you do if you i think if (16:26 - 16:30)
you are doing this every day if you are (16:28 - 16:32)
for sure on top of it i think this on (16:30 - 16:37)
the surface this looks like a great deal (16:32 - 16:38)
no i agree it's like i the only (16:37 - 16:40)
comparable thing i can think of for me (16:38 - 16:43)
would be like mtg arena where like if (16:40 - 16:44)
there was some subscription i could pay (16:43 - 16:47)
monthly and it guaranteed that i could (16:44 - 16:50)
get entry into like even say four drafts (16:47 - 16:51)
a month yeah (16:50 - 16:53)
i'd do it (16:51 - 16:54)
right rather than having to grind for (16:53 - 16:55)
the coins (16:54 - 16:58)
are we friends on arena i just (16:55 - 17:00)
i just brought it up again (16:58 - 17:02)
man the matchmaking is not great in that (17:00 - 17:04)
game you got that right it's funny (17:02 - 17:07)
because when when um pokemon go does (17:04 - 17:10)
like the like the events of you know (17:07 - 17:12)
spend a dollar get this experience get (17:10 - 17:14)
this candy get this pop and get this (17:12 - 17:18)
rocket radar get this lucky egg i'm like (17:14 - 17:21)
this is perfect i use everything here (17:18 - 17:22)
and then i read what this is it's like (17:21 - 17:25)
two free trial license i don't care (17:22 - 17:27)
about that like i have zero desire to (17:25 - 17:29)
try (17:27 - 17:30)
talonflame again i mean i did try (17:29 - 17:33)
talonflame initially but like (17:30 - 17:35)
two like two free trial license two (17:33 - 17:37)
hollower trial license a week it's like (17:35 - 17:39)
okay what does that mean (17:37 - 17:42)
like i get a costume for blastoise for a (17:39 - 17:43)
week (17:42 - 17:46)
like i might play blastoise like once (17:43 - 17:50)
um discount off trainer fashion like (17:46 - 17:52)
yeah i mean i guess (17:50 - 17:53)
like i don't know how much stuff i'm (17:52 - 17:55)
buying (17:53 - 17:56)
it's just (17:55 - 17:59)
you're right in the sense of like the 40 (17:56 - 18:01)
gems a day should pay for itself but (17:59 - 18:03)
there there's like stuff in this battle (18:01 - 18:07)
pass that like i just do not care about (18:03 - 18:10)
oh yeah we're not battle pass sorry uh (18:07 - 18:12)
subscription service yeah but if people (18:10 - 18:14)
are unite mains right this may be stuff (18:12 - 18:18)
that they care about that they want (18:14 - 18:20)
where just none of us are unite i i (18:18 - 18:21)
don't know i kind of think of like if (18:20 - 18:24)
somebody is hardcore enough in unite (18:21 - 18:27)
that they're buying the battle passes (18:24 - 18:29)
that they're considering the (18:27 - 18:31)
subscription (18:29 - 18:33)
do they do they do (18:31 - 18:35)
i feel like at this point they probably (18:33 - 18:36)
know what characters they like and don't (18:35 - 18:39)
like and well (18:36 - 18:41)
i will say that i i will say i'm a (18:39 - 18:44)
hardcore player than either of you are (18:41 - 18:45)
and (18:44 - 18:48)
i will say that sometimes the license (18:45 - 18:49)
trial licenses (18:48 - 18:52)
because i have way more j i get gems and (18:49 - 18:54)
i don't know what character to spend (18:52 - 18:56)
them on like i don't know if i'm gonna (18:54 - 18:59)
like this gameplay style (18:56 - 19:02)
so trial licenses do help in that (18:59 - 19:04)
situation where it's like i have a (19:02 - 19:06)
[Music] (19:04 - 19:09)
mission that i have to play a speedster (19:06 - 19:11)
i don't like any of the speedsters i (19:09 - 19:13)
currently have but i have this trial for (19:11 - 19:15)
gengar (19:13 - 19:16)
let me see if i like that gameplay to (19:15 - 19:18)
make to pull the (19:16 - 19:21)
the lever on purchasing it like i do (19:18 - 19:24)
think the license trials make sense i (19:21 - 19:28)
don't understand the hollow wear well (19:24 - 19:29)
i mean (19:28 - 19:30)
to me (19:29 - 19:33)
it resembles like what a lot of mobas do (19:30 - 19:37)
where people just go wild for skins and (19:33 - 19:40)
they collect as many skins as possible (19:37 - 19:42)
and what could possibly happen is right (19:40 - 19:44)
if this subscription is successful they (19:42 - 19:46)
greatly expand the number of skins that (19:44 - 19:48)
are available (19:46 - 19:50)
and then it's like oh you can try this (19:48 - 19:52)
skin and show that you've got the (19:50 - 19:54)
subscription where other people don't by (19:52 - 19:56)
putting it on your characters or trying (19:54 - 19:58)
a different character just so that you (19:56 - 20:00)
can show off the skin right like to me (19:58 - 20:02)
skins make no sense at all right yeah (20:00 - 20:06)
but but people really go for that yeah i (20:02 - 20:08)
think i think the thing that i'm saying (20:06 - 20:11)
is like there's a little bit (20:08 - 20:13)
of interest for (20:11 - 20:15)
a lot i think what would cover the (20:13 - 20:18)
majority of unite players and and mobile (20:15 - 20:20)
players right like there's a little bit (20:18 - 20:23)
of something for everyone (20:20 - 20:26)
uh at a good price so like an ign review (20:23 - 20:27)
yeah a little bit of something for (20:26 - 20:28)
everyone (20:27 - 20:30)
[Laughter] (20:28 - 20:34)
uh yeah i mean (20:30 - 20:34)
i when i first write it i was like oh (20:35 - 20:40)
i'm tempted (20:38 - 20:42)
but (20:40 - 20:43)
not how much money have you given you (20:42 - 20:46)
not (20:43 - 20:46)
twenty dollars oh we're in the same boat (20:46 - 20:51)
yeah more than me (20:49 - 20:54)
yeah but you also have gotten stipends i (20:51 - 20:56)
have not yes i believe the pokemon (20:54 - 20:58)
company has given me (20:56 - 21:00)
three stipends for unite (20:58 - 21:04)
uh i have bought two battle passes i'm (21:00 - 21:06)
out of gems so (21:04 - 21:07)
unless another real good battle pass (21:06 - 21:09)
comes along i am no i'm out of the (21:07 - 21:11)
battle pass game too i bought the (21:09 - 21:14)
concert one to get uh (21:11 - 21:18)
concert sylveon it's absolutely adorable (21:14 - 21:21)
um did you ever pay did you play the (21:18 - 21:23)
full-fledged battles (21:21 - 21:26)
one did you ever do that i i was i was (21:23 - 21:27)
playing during that time but i didn't (21:26 - 21:30)
play the the mode (21:27 - 21:31)
that mode (21:30 - 21:34)
is the wildest thing (21:31 - 21:38)
i have ever played it's pure chaos from (21:34 - 21:41)
start to finish (21:38 - 21:41)
it was really fun but man it was chaotic (21:42 - 21:47)
because you have your moves (21:45 - 21:48)
up all the time (21:47 - 21:51)
there's no cooldowns oh that's fine (21:48 - 21:54)
that's a lot of fun yeah so like i was (21:51 - 21:55)
playing sylveon and like you know you (21:54 - 21:57)
get mystic fire and it was four i could (21:55 - 21:59)

game though never mind (25:55 - 26:00)
um (25:58 - 26:00)
i guess they could do magikarp again (26:02 - 26:07)
but i i would be curious if they're (26:05 - 26:08)
gonna do something (26:07 - 26:10)

what (26:33 - 26:35)
yeah (26:34 - 26:37)
we're here are you seeing this is at the (26:35 - 26:40)
end of the trailer (26:37 - 26:42)
let me get to the end of the trailer (26:40 - 26:44)
hold on (26:42 - 26:44)
uh (26:45 - 26:49)
let me get hold on i have to get past (26:46 - 26:50)
this ad (26:49 - 26:53)
oh this is so annoying um other sink (26:50 - 26:54)
pairs with morty and how oh they're (26:53 - 26:56)
doing giovanni and nidoqueen (26:54 - 26:59)
needle king sorry uh aaron and vespa (26:56 - 27:00)
quinn (26:59 - 27:03)
bertha and hippowdon and lucian and (27:00 - 27:06)
giraffe right (27:03 - 27:06)
um (27:08 - 27:11)
that's what cerebri is reporting i don't (27:09 - 27:14)
see the lucian and giraffe rig i don't (27:11 - 27:16)
maybe that was in the trailer (27:14 - 27:17)
um (27:16 - 27:19)
no they didn't really talk about any of (27:17 - 27:21)
those in the trailer (27:19 - 27:24)
yeah so i'm not a million percent (27:21 - 27:26)
sure where he's he's pulling that from (27:24 - 27:30)
but that's that's off therapy so (27:26 - 27:30)
my master news normally comes from the (27:32 - 27:37)
japanese master account because like (27:34 - 27:38)
they update (27:37 - 27:39)
actually quickly and accurately compared (27:38 - 27:42)
to the american one (27:39 - 27:44)
here it is i'm at the end of the trailer (27:42 - 27:46)
starting may 4th for a limited time you (27:44 - 27:48)
can get an amazing rewards based on the (27:46 - 27:50)
total number of magikarp eggs hatched by (27:48 - 27:54)
all players get up to 3 000 gems and (27:50 - 27:57)
more items from a rally (27:54 - 27:57)
and then there's a (27:58 - 28:02)
rare chance of getting a shiny magikarp (28:00 - 28:03)
through (28:02 - 28:05)
the egg battles if you're lucky if (28:03 - 28:07)
you're lucky (28:05 - 28:08)
but yeah so (28:07 - 28:11)
starting may 4th (28:08 - 28:13)
hatch them carps (28:11 - 28:17)
got it and then we all get gems (28:13 - 28:19)
i'm much happier with the current state (28:17 - 28:20)
of masters (28:19 - 28:23)
because they are much less stingy about (28:20 - 28:25)
the gems the pairs aren't necessarily (28:23 - 28:26)
better (28:25 - 28:29)
but at least i don't feel as terrible (28:26 - 28:32)
when i pull on something bad yeah cause (28:29 - 28:33)
it's like okay i'm gonna get i'm gonna (28:32 - 28:35)
get i'm gonna get another chance in like (28:33 - 28:36)
a week and a half plus all these rallies (28:35 - 28:39)
and stuff add up and i got my polti (28:36 - 28:43)
geist i got my shiny serena so i'm (28:39 - 28:47)
good the radials are fun (28:43 - 28:47)
let's take a break uh (28:49 - 28:52)
the (28:51 - 28:54)
on the flip side here after the break we (28:52 - 28:57)

stuff so we will see you in a second (29:11 - 29:15)
and we are back from our break uh first (29:17 - 29:24)
bit of news here is uh well i guess we (29:21 - 29:24)
knew (29:24 - 29:27)
when the may community day was going to (29:24 - 29:27)
be (29:27 - 29:30)
uh they announced like three dates (29:27 - 29:32)
pretty early on uh but now we know what (29:30 - 29:36)
it is it is elo lingeo dude (29:32 - 29:38)
which uh not surprising since (29:36 - 29:40)
they did ll and sandshrew and then they (29:38 - 29:41)
did (29:40 - 29:44)
so uh i actually thought they were maybe (29:41 - 29:46)
gonna do like a little vulpix and vulpix (29:44 - 29:48)
like they did the samsung yeah and i (29:46 - 29:49)
think (29:48 - 29:51)
even though like i would personally not (29:49 - 29:52)
care because i have a million ella lynch (29:51 - 29:55)
tiny vulpix um (29:52 - 29:58)
that just vulpix is a relatively very (29:55 - 30:00)
popular pokemon (29:58 - 30:01)
um (30:00 - 30:03)
judo does fit their three-stage (30:01 - 30:05)
evolution thing uh hey i don't know to (30:03 - 30:09)

so i'm i'm kind of excited i'm not (30:36 - 30:43)
thrilled about the time frame (30:39 - 30:43)
yeah (30:44 - 30:46)
[Laughter] (30:44 - 30:48)
there's an orange sitting outside my (30:46 - 30:50)
house get it (30:48 - 30:51)
well here's the thing is like it's 11 to (30:50 - 30:53)
2 and when we when when stuff was (30:51 - 30:55)
announced people were like ah two to (30:53 - 30:58)
five like two to five is really hot for (30:55 - 30:59)
you know like maybe like in arizona or (30:58 - 31:01)
something and (30:59 - 31:02)
like two to five is perfect for me (31:01 - 31:05)
because i get to sleep in and i don't (31:02 - 31:07)
have to i can go and get lunch and (31:05 - 31:09)
without feeling rushed (31:07 - 31:11)
like if i want to eat breakfast with (31:09 - 31:12)
people (31:11 - 31:14)
i'm gonna have to get up at like nine (31:12 - 31:16)
leave at like 9 30. hopefully the (31:14 - 31:19)
restaurant's not behind like it (31:16 - 31:21)
to me i don't like the early mornings (31:19 - 31:22)
but i'm sure there are people listening (31:21 - 31:24)
that love this time compared to the (31:22 - 31:25)
people who were complaining that yeah (31:24 - 31:28)
two to five didn't work for them it's (31:25 - 31:30)
almost like if they had like a longer (31:28 - 31:33)
period yeah they could make more people (31:30 - 31:35)
what if they had spread that out to like (31:33 - 31:37)
five or six hours and people could pick (31:35 - 31:39)
when the three-hour period they wanted (31:37 - 31:41)
to go to when that what kind of world (31:39 - 31:44)
would that have been (31:41 - 31:46)
i was i was seeing other content (31:44 - 31:48)
creators kind of pushing for like a four (31:46 - 31:50)
hour window instead of a three hour (31:48 - 31:52)
which is better than the three right i (31:50 - 31:54)
mean (31:52 - 31:56)
it's a compromise it's not a good (31:54 - 31:58)
compromise at that point just say five (31:56 - 32:01)
then just say six then just say six just (31:58 - 32:03)
said make it all day like peak when what (32:01 - 32:06)
about five hours and 59 minutes (32:03 - 32:08)
then everybody's happy yeah five likes (32:06 - 32:11)
like it's like things costing 5.99 at (32:08 - 32:13)
least it's not six bucks (32:11 - 32:15)
um (32:13 - 32:18)
so alolan geodude is featured (32:15 - 32:20)
it will have an exclusive move of (32:18 - 32:22)
rollout i i don't i'm not a competitive (32:20 - 32:23)
person i don't know if that's good or (32:22 - 32:25)
not you have the dollar story (32:23 - 32:28)
uh there they have still upped the event (32:25 - 32:30)
bonuses so that was like a great thing (32:28 - 32:32)
that came out of the scuffle uh (32:30 - 32:34)
obviously the stufful got really (32:32 - 32:36)
um (32:34 - 32:37)
you know pushed in the mud because of (32:36 - 32:39)
the time zone thing or the time length (32:37 - 32:41)
thing but the the event bonuses for (32:39 - 32:43)
stuff were really great (32:41 - 32:46)
um and they're carrying those over here (32:43 - 32:48)
so we're getting three times the catch (32:46 - 32:50)
stardust two times the catch candy so (32:48 - 32:55)
again double bonus um two times the uh (32:50 - 32:58)
xl geodude candy from catching (32:55 - 33:00)
uh incense will last three hours lures (32:58 - 33:02)
will last three hours snapshots those (33:00 - 33:04)
are normal additional special trade and (33:02 - 33:06)
then trades will be fifty percent the (33:04 - 33:08)
stardust um (33:06 - 33:10)
so (33:08 - 33:12)
rewards seem great (33:10 - 33:14)
uh and if you work together trainers (33:12 - 33:16)
will unlock if there's enough pokemon (33:14 - 33:17)
caught in a single lure module three (33:16 - 33:19)
times the catch stardust bonus for (33:17 - 33:21)
trainers near the alert stop will become (33:19 - 33:24)
times four for 30 minutes i will (33:21 - 33:28)
honestly say i did not notice if that (33:24 - 33:29)
actually happened (33:28 - 33:32)
during this last community yeah that's (33:29 - 33:33)
the one thing i wanted to talk about (33:32 - 33:35)
before we move on to different news is (33:33 - 33:37)
like the bonuses whatever like you (33:35 - 33:38)
either love them you hate them there's (33:37 - 33:39)
more bonuses than there ever has been (33:38 - 33:42)
before for community (33:39 - 33:43)
uh (33:42 - 33:45)
the for stuffel it was supposed to be (33:43 - 33:48)
like four times the catch bonus at lures (33:45 - 33:50)
if enough people caught it (33:48 - 33:52)
and greg and i were at the boston common (33:50 - 33:53)
garden (33:52 - 33:54)
uh which is (33:53 - 33:57)
one of niantic's featured parks yep (33:54 - 33:58)
thanks for everybody coming out it's (33:57 - 34:00)
great and (33:58 - 34:02)
one of the best places to play in boston (34:00 - 34:04)
and i i said on the show multiple times (34:02 - 34:06)
i really do enjoy playing pokemon go in (34:04 - 34:08)
boston because that city is so historic (34:06 - 34:10)
there's so many stops everywhere (34:08 - 34:13)
we walked that park three hours (34:10 - 34:15)
you know we stopped maybe (34:13 - 34:18)
we we stopped like we started in a place (34:15 - 34:20)
for like 15 minutes before we even moved (34:18 - 34:22)
and then we moved and then we all took (34:20 - 34:24)
like a 15-20 minute sit-down break at (34:22 - 34:26)
the the gazebo (34:24 - 34:28)
i don't know (34:26 - 34:30)
if these lure like if we were getting (34:28 - 34:33)
the four times bonus like there were (34:30 - 34:35)
clearly enough people in that park where (34:33 - 34:38)
that had to be happening it had to be (34:35 - 34:39)
but it was so (34:38 - 34:41)
i don't know if the lures were supposed (34:39 - 34:43)
to like turn colors or light up or like (34:41 - 34:45)
without like looking at the experience (34:43 - 34:48)
which i wasn't like i i look look if i (34:45 - 34:49)
get an excellent i know it's going to be (34:48 - 34:51)
more if i miss it it's going to be a (34:49 - 34:52)
bummer but i'm not going to like look at (34:51 - 34:54)
the experience every time i'm just going (34:52 - 34:55)
to catch and i'm like walking and i'm (34:54 - 34:57)
talking and i'm saying hi to people and (34:55 - 34:59)
having these conversations (34:57 - 35:01)
like isn't that what community is about (34:59 - 35:03)
diane i'm having (35:01 - 35:05)
like i'm meeting people yeah i'm saying (35:03 - 35:07)
hi you want me to look at the phone and (35:05 - 35:09)
also calc experience like i don't know (35:07 - 35:12)
if your event thing is working or not (35:09 - 35:14)
why don't you just trust them i mean i (35:12 - 35:16)
have to trust that it was i had a trust (35:14 - 35:19)
that was in in there but it was (35:16 - 35:22)
completely invisible right like until (35:19 - 35:24)
you brought it up again i'm like (35:22 - 35:26)
oh right that was supposed to be a thing (35:24 - 35:29)
i i have to assume (35:26 - 35:32)
it had to be in place but (35:29 - 35:34)
when i look at what happened at the end (35:32 - 35:36)
of the day where i was compared to a (35:34 - 35:38)
normal community i wasn't blown away (35:36 - 35:40)
like oh wow (35:38 - 35:42)
i'm so far ahead and oh that was such a (35:40 - 35:44)
different change it's like oh i have (35:42 - 35:47)
nine shiny scuffle i had a lot of fun i (35:44 - 35:49)
met a lot of great people (35:47 - 35:52)
i have more stuff i guess but i couldn't (35:49 - 35:54)
tell you that it was more more stuff i (35:52 - 35:58)
mean i had the the i had the 400 stufful (35:54 - 36:01)
candy in in 20 minutes (35:58 - 36:04)
i pinapped every stuffel yeah when when (36:01 - 36:06)
i wasn't actually actively looking at (36:04 - 36:09)
the game i just had the go plus running (36:06 - 36:10)
um (36:09 - 36:12)
like after every 30 minutes i would (36:10 - 36:14)
throw away stufful the (36:12 - 36:16)
i was never worried about the candy (36:14 - 36:18)
and even though i didn't really play (36:16 - 36:19)
hardcore there was probably you know out (36:18 - 36:21)
of three hours there's probably 20 to 30 (36:19 - 36:23)
minutes where i like i didn't play (36:21 - 36:24)
because i was like (36:23 - 36:27)
actually like everything away talking to (36:24 - 36:28)
people (36:27 - 36:31)
i i almost have enough xl candy (36:28 - 36:32)
to (36:31 - 36:33)
like (36:32 - 36:35)
bring a bewear to 50. (36:33 - 36:37)
and i probably if i would have actually (36:35 - 36:39)
paid attention and ignored everyone i (36:37 - 36:41)
probably could have easily done that (36:39 - 36:44)
like get enough xl candy i remember like (36:41 - 36:46)
it was halfway through the day and i i (36:44 - 36:48)
was like oh i should see if i can evolve (36:46 - 36:50)
stuff into a shiny beware when i looked (36:48 - 36:51)
at my candies i had (36:50 - 36:54)
like 1200 scuffle candy and i'm like (36:51 - 36:56)
well (36:54 - 36:59)
i get i'm absolutely able to do this now (36:56 - 37:03)
yeah and then like i do remember hoppip (36:59 - 37:05)
having the like extra candy and that was (37:03 - 37:07)
during the like xl (37:05 - 37:10)
and i think i ended up with like 212 xl (37:07 - 37:12)
candy for beware and i think you need (37:10 - 37:13)
like 297 (37:12 - 37:16)
to or like like something like that like (37:13 - 37:18)
280 to get it to 50 for xl (37:16 - 37:21)
and i remember doing five hours of (37:18 - 37:22)
pop-up (37:21 - 37:26)
and only walking away with like 165 xl (37:22 - 37:28)
and (37:26 - 37:31)
and to be fair niantic was you know (37:28 - 37:33)
correct in the fact of like (37:31 - 37:35)
less time (37:33 - 37:38)
more rewards at least comparing those (37:35 - 37:40)
two instances for me like i did get more (37:38 - 37:44)
xl candy for stuffel in a shorter window (37:40 - 37:46)
than excel candy for hobbit (37:44 - 37:48)
i will and i do appreciate that (37:46 - 37:51)
that yeah i got i got more stuff in less (37:48 - 37:55)
time i felt more (37:51 - 37:55)
pressed and (37:56 - 37:59)
anxious about the three hours then i had (38:01 - 38:06)
even though we've only ever done three (38:05 - 38:08)
hours before the fact that it was (38:06 - 38:10)
such a short (38:08 - 38:11)
window (38:10 - 38:13)
felt really (38:11 - 38:16)
bad to me like everybody was always (38:13 - 38:17)
aware of (38:16 - 38:20)
of it the place was packed with people (38:17 - 38:22)
because we all had to be at the same (38:20 - 38:25)
time it felt claustrophobic (38:22 - 38:26)
um (38:25 - 38:28)
i i overall (38:26 - 38:31)
i like a three hour window makes this (38:28 - 38:33)
less enjoyable to me (38:31 - 38:36)
i well i think part of at least for me i (38:33 - 38:38)
because i i share similar feelings with (38:36 - 38:40)
you greg i felt very like (38:38 - 38:42)
pressured in that window (38:40 - 38:44)
but i think i think my pressure came (38:42 - 38:47)
from the fact that uh (38:44 - 38:50)
we had a very stressful and uh (38:47 - 38:52)
everything went wrong morning (38:50 - 38:53)
of (38:52 - 38:55)
the trains were being down trying to get (38:53 - 38:56)
on a bus the bus (38:55 - 38:58)
not going the right way us getting off (38:56 - 39:01)
like it sucked we were 15 minutes late (38:58 - 39:04)
to our own event and like we rushed (39:01 - 39:05)
through breakfast really quick and that (39:04 - 39:07)
sucked like ideally like greg and i had (39:05 - 39:09)
it planned where we were going to wake (39:07 - 39:10)
up we were going to have a nice (39:09 - 39:12)
breakfast with our friend nick and a (39:10 - 39:14)
bunch of other friends we were going to (39:12 - 39:16)
go from breakfast to community (39:14 - 39:18)
ideally get there like 30 minutes early (39:16 - 39:20)
so we can just hang out and none of that (39:18 - 39:21)
happened no (39:20 - 39:23)
wait wait wait didn't community day (39:21 - 39:24)
start at 2 o'clock in the afternoon (39:23 - 39:28)
correct yeah how are you breakfast we (39:24 - 39:30)
left the hotel to have lunch (39:28 - 39:32)
at noon brunchy we left at 11 30 to walk (39:30 - 39:35)
to the station okay okay we were (39:32 - 39:37)
supposed to get like ideally if the red (39:35 - 39:39)
line was working (39:37 - 39:42)
alewife to harvard is a 10 minute right (39:39 - 39:44)
train ride so we were gonna get at the (39:42 - 39:47)
restaurant at noon (39:44 - 39:49)
eat for like an hour (39:47 - 39:52)
take a leap take another public transit (39:49 - 39:53)
to get the comments which would have (39:52 - 39:55)
taken us half an hour no from from (39:53 - 39:57)
harvard to (39:55 - 40:00)
uh the park would have taken 15 minutes (39:57 - 40:02)
right but i'm just saying like at most (40:00 - 40:03)
it could take if there's traffic because (40:02 - 40:04)
it was during lunch (40:03 - 40:07)
uh it all went horribly even that even (40:04 - 40:09)
even approaching like we were 15 minutes (40:07 - 40:12)
late which is bad i felt awful that we (40:09 - 40:14)
were late uh that is like my number one (40:12 - 40:17)
stressor like like your whole thing (40:14 - 40:19)
about like the car breaking down on the (40:17 - 40:22)
side of the road is like you're like me (40:19 - 40:25)
me being late to an event i planned (40:22 - 40:28)
or am is somewhat in charge of is you're (40:25 - 40:32)
by the side of the road thing like i was (40:28 - 40:34)
so angry on that bus (40:32 - 40:37)
it's not even funny but even then once (40:34 - 40:39)
we got there it was 15 minutes i you (40:37 - 40:41)
know everybody had gathered nobody was (40:39 - 40:43)
upset every like (40:41 - 40:46)
all of that stress went away and i still (40:43 - 40:49)
felt like once we started and it went (40:46 - 40:51)
around (40:49 - 40:54)
that there was too many people it was (40:51 - 40:56)
super crowded it was super stressful (40:54 - 40:59)
everybody had this energy (40:56 - 41:01)
of (40:59 - 41:03)
not being relaxed but like i have to (41:01 - 41:06)
maximize my time (41:03 - 41:09)
and the crowd just felt (41:06 - 41:13)
off like it just didn't feel (41:09 - 41:15)
relaxing i think you have to factor in (41:13 - 41:19)
somewhat that it was pax weekend (41:15 - 41:21)
so there were probably a higher (41:19 - 41:24)
concentration of pokemon go players in (41:21 - 41:27)
that area than there would normally be (41:24 - 41:30)
i mean that yeah that didn't help (41:27 - 41:32)
but yeah it just it felt like my first (41:30 - 41:35)
experience going back to the three hours (41:32 - 41:38)
felt bad well i would say that there was (41:35 - 41:40)
like right around (41:38 - 41:42)
two i would say from two to three it was (41:40 - 41:45)
the pack the park was most packed (41:42 - 41:48)
because we had a group of (41:45 - 41:51)
so i i told other content creators or or (41:48 - 41:53)
other content creators came up to me at (41:51 - 41:54)
pax and they said what are you doing for (41:53 - 41:56)
community day and i said oh i'm going to (41:54 - 41:58)
the boston common gardens and they were (41:56 - 42:00)
like oh where's that i was like it's the (41:58 - 42:03)
biggest park in the middle of boston (42:00 - 42:04)
like (42:03 - 42:06)
it's right here and they're like can we (42:04 - 42:08)
join you and bring like can we tell (42:06 - 42:09)
people that that's where and i was like (42:08 - 42:10)
yeah of course so i made that little (42:09 - 42:11)
graphic (42:10 - 42:13)
um which i think turned out very nice (42:11 - 42:16)
yeah and i was like to work i was like (42:13 - 42:18)
feel free to like retweet like join us (42:16 - 42:20)
here like i'm like why would i say no (42:18 - 42:22)
like i want people to come together (42:20 - 42:24)
um (42:22 - 42:26)
so when we got to that gazebo it ended (42:24 - 42:28)
up being like 60 people (42:26 - 42:30)
uh and (42:28 - 42:32)
and i was like well i guess i'm telling (42:30 - 42:34)
everyone we're moving i don't want to (42:32 - 42:36)
stand here the entire time and like (42:34 - 42:39)
you know if if if ever (42:36 - 42:40)
if everyone's standing there everyone's (42:39 - 42:41)
standing there so like somebody has to (42:40 - 42:43)
make the move (42:41 - 42:44)
so i was like hey we're moving out and (42:43 - 42:46)
then people followed and we we went (42:44 - 42:48)
around the park at least probably about (42:46 - 42:50)
once and then that crowd kind of like (42:48 - 42:53)
disappeared yeah and i would say about (42:50 - 42:56)
30 to 40 people like actually left the (42:53 - 43:00)
park which is which is fine right you (42:56 - 43:02)
have a lot of people who play go but (43:00 - 43:05)
don't play go like myself where (43:02 - 43:07)
they got their two shinies they don't (43:05 - 43:09)
care about experience they don't care (43:07 - 43:10)
about candy they don't care about (43:09 - 43:11)
grinding they don't care about the (43:10 - 43:13)
rewards and they're going back to the (43:11 - 43:15)
convention or they're going back to (43:13 - 43:17)
their hotel or they're going to lunch (43:15 - 43:18)
right (43:17 - 43:20)
so (43:18 - 43:23)
after three o'clock i would say it felt (43:20 - 43:26)
kind of a little bit lighter because (43:23 - 43:29)
there was a handful of people that they (43:26 - 43:31)
got their two shinies within the hour or (43:29 - 43:34)
they're three or four and then they left (43:31 - 43:36)
and you know i i went through and i got (43:34 - 43:38)
a million experience for that three (43:36 - 43:40)
hours and that's to me that's great i'm (43:38 - 43:43)
level 47. i need 21x (43:40 - 43:46)
21 million experience to get to 48. i (43:43 - 43:48)
knocked out a huge chunk of a million (43:46 - 43:50)
in that hour so like (43:48 - 43:53)
reward wise (43:50 - 43:55)
from the candy to the experience to the (43:53 - 43:58)
whatever else niantic was doing (43:55 - 43:59)
great (43:58 - 44:02)
uh but yeah the the the like pressure (43:59 - 44:05)
of like three hours (44:02 - 44:07)
didn't feel like like i honestly kind of (44:05 - 44:09)
start started to be like just give us (44:07 - 44:10)
the (44:09 - 44:12)
four i'll take four hours at this point (44:10 - 44:16)
i really do think an extra hour yeah is (44:12 - 44:18)
is like just (44:16 - 44:21)
it's just it (44:18 - 44:21)
i what they wanted was a bunch of people (44:22 - 44:25)
playing at the same time (44:24 - 44:29)
oh they got that but it felt bad (44:25 - 44:31)
it just felt (44:29 - 44:34)
more chaotic and more (44:31 - 44:37)
stressful (44:34 - 44:37)
uh speaking of chaotic (44:39 - 44:44)
mega evolution got well it's not really (44:42 - 44:46)
chaotic makeup is like that's a bad (44:44 - 44:48)
transition (44:46 - 44:51)
uh mega evolution (44:48 - 44:53)
is getting revamped it's already live in (44:51 - 44:55)
australia and new zealand (44:53 - 44:59)
um there's like a dev diary thing and (44:55 - 45:00)
some people were mad that they spent a (44:59 - 45:02)
dev diary on (45:00 - 45:05)
mega evolution i'm confused about this (45:02 - 45:06)
anger because like (45:05 - 45:09)
the devil is diary (45:06 - 45:12)
huh who is mad oh the silk road twitter (45:09 - 45:13)
well (45:12 - 45:15)
are we saying that the reddit the reddit (45:13 - 45:17)
anger machine produced anger like i (45:15 - 45:19)
would well this off road usually is is (45:17 - 45:23)
angry about the same stuff we are (45:19 - 45:23)
i would i (45:23 - 45:26)
they're reasonable people over there for (45:24 - 45:27)
the most part (45:26 - 45:29)
i think the silph road forget sometimes (45:27 - 45:31)
that like they they are the minority of (45:29 - 45:33)
players but (45:31 - 45:34)
um (45:33 - 45:36)
but they're the ones who care the most (45:34 - 45:38)
so they're the most important they do (45:36 - 45:39)
right (45:38 - 45:41)
yeah i'm not sure why people are are mad (45:39 - 45:43)
that they spent mega evolution on the (45:41 - 45:45)
dev diaries because (45:43 - 45:48)
development the developers that like (45:45 - 45:51)
they they reworked an entire system a (45:48 - 45:53)
system that people complained about i (45:51 - 45:54)
really think like i don't know it kind (45:53 - 45:56)
of made sense that they put it here a (45:54 - 45:58)
significant change to a major component (45:56 - 46:00)
of the way the game works hmm (45:58 - 46:03)
that seems like a dev diary thing (46:00 - 46:04)
um (46:03 - 46:06)
the highlights here uh most mega raids (46:04 - 46:09)
will be easier you can do it with fewer (46:06 - 46:10)
people (46:09 - 46:11)
you'll be able to mega evolve your (46:10 - 46:14)
pokemon from the raid and the battle (46:11 - 46:15)
prep screen (46:14 - 46:18)
both so far so good two for two (46:15 - 46:20)
uh pokemon you have mega evolved before (46:18 - 46:22)
will now have an additional visual (46:20 - 46:24)
effect added to their information page (46:22 - 46:26)
to commemorate this (46:24 - 46:29)
monuments (46:26 - 46:29)
you know monumental work there too (46:30 - 46:36)
that's not the word that they chose (46:33 - 46:39)
uh we're implementing mega levels and (46:36 - 46:42)
changing how mega energy is used (46:39 - 46:44)
so those are their four big bullet (46:42 - 46:47)
points (46:44 - 46:47)
um being a pokemon trainer is all about (46:47 - 46:51)
helping your pokemon grow we are (46:49 - 46:53)
introducing a new way for do that mega (46:51 - 46:54)
levels every time you make a volvo (46:53 - 46:56)
pokemon you work increasing its mega (46:54 - 46:58)
level you will get more bonus every time (46:56 - 47:00)
a pokemon mega level goes up these (46:58 - 47:01)
bonuses will stay active when your (47:00 - 47:04)
pokemon is mega evolved each mega level (47:01 - 47:06)
will grant bonuses bonuses vary by (47:04 - 47:08)
pokemon all bonuses will improve a (47:06 - 47:11)
pokemon's mega level increase existing (47:08 - 47:12)
bonuses (47:11 - 47:13)
increase can (47:12 - 47:16)
increased candy when catch the pokemon (47:13 - 47:17)
of the same type of your mega that's (47:16 - 47:20)
always been a thing (47:17 - 47:22)
while attacking with a mega evolved (47:20 - 47:23)
pokemon in a raid or a gym the attacks (47:22 - 47:25)
of other trainers challenging the same (47:23 - 47:27)
rate or gym will deal more damage that's (47:25 - 47:29)
been a thing too their pokemon attacks (47:27 - 47:32)
will deal even more damage if it's the (47:29 - 47:35)
same type as your mega evolved pokemon (47:32 - 47:37)
new bonuses (47:35 - 47:38)
so they're keeping the same two things (47:37 - 47:40)
that megas those already done i just (47:38 - 47:42)
read those (47:40 - 47:44)
i'm just being very clear because i know (47:42 - 47:45)
there's a lot of people listening that (47:44 - 47:47)
still go like why would i ever mega (47:45 - 47:50)
evolve we were at lunch with nick and uh (47:47 - 47:52)
his wife and his wife was like i've (47:50 - 47:54)
never mega evolved before why would i do (47:52 - 47:54)
it (47:54 - 47:57)
those those were the two reasons why (47:54 - 47:59)
the new bonuses (47:57 - 48:00)
are (47:59 - 48:02)
you increase (48:00 - 48:04)
chance of earning xl candy when you (48:02 - 48:06)
catch pokemon that is the same type as (48:04 - 48:08)
your mega pokemon (48:06 - 48:10)
so this is going to be probably for more (48:08 - 48:12)
hardcore people i didn't really care (48:10 - 48:15)
about xl candy at all because i (48:12 - 48:18)
i i just like i've never had problems (48:15 - 48:20)
with raids i've never had to power a (48:18 - 48:21)
pokemon like i'm always in a raid with (48:20 - 48:23)
like 20 15 people it's never been i (48:21 - 48:25)
could bring sixth antler it doesn't (48:23 - 48:26)
matter (48:25 - 48:27)
um (48:26 - 48:29)
i only started caring about excel candy (48:27 - 48:31)
because i needed the xl candy to get (48:29 - 48:33)
from 46 to (48:31 - 48:36)
47. uh so you get (48:33 - 48:39)
increased chance of exo candy (48:36 - 48:41)
increased xp for catching pokemon that (48:39 - 48:43)
are the same type so that's going to be (48:41 - 48:46)
good for me because i need xp now (48:43 - 48:48)
a pokemon's rest period (48:46 - 48:53)
decreases as the mega level increases (48:48 - 48:55)
um so with this update after you make (48:53 - 48:56)
evolve a pokemon for the first time (48:55 - 48:58)
you'll be able to mega evolve that same (48:56 - 49:01)
pokemon again without using mega energy (48:58 - 49:04)
after mega evolving your pokemon will be (49:01 - 49:06)
fatigued and need time before it can (49:04 - 49:08)
mega evolve again once its rest period (49:06 - 49:10)
is over that pokemon can mega evolve (49:08 - 49:12)
again without using mega energy you can (49:10 - 49:14)
use mega energy to decrease the rest (49:12 - 49:16)
period mega energy is required to make (49:14 - 49:18)
evolving pokemon (49:16 - 49:20)
um (49:18 - 49:21)
mega energy required to make evolving (49:20 - 49:23)
pokemon will decrease as a pokemon's (49:21 - 49:25)
rest period becomes shorter so (49:23 - 49:27)
ultimately ultimately the short of it is (49:25 - 49:29)
you need to collect the mega candy up (49:27 - 49:30)
front by doing the mega raids which they (49:29 - 49:33)
made easier once you mega evolve you (49:30 - 49:35)
will be able to mega evolve again that (49:33 - 49:36)
pokemon completely for free in the (49:35 - 49:38)
future there will just be an artificial (49:36 - 49:40)
timer on it whether that's like seven (49:38 - 49:41)
days or five days or three days or 12 (49:40 - 49:42)
hours (49:41 - 49:44)
the more you may go evolve it the more (49:42 - 49:47)
that timer will permanently go down (49:44 - 49:49)
i mean i came to mega ball them once a (49:47 - 49:53)
year so i think my cooldown is safe (49:49 - 49:53)
so (49:53 - 49:57)
i think this is better (49:54 - 49:59)
i don't think anyone's just i don't (49:57 - 50:01)
think this is worse in any way (49:59 - 50:03)
no i think it's better (50:01 - 50:04)
um (50:03 - 50:06)
yeah i think (50:04 - 50:08)
this is this is a great change i i there (50:06 - 50:10)
are moments where niantic just does (50:08 - 50:12)
things right and does knock things out (50:10 - 50:14)
of the park i think this is one (50:12 - 50:16)
um obviously the majority of people are (50:14 - 50:18)
very unhappy with mega evolution at the (50:16 - 50:21)
at the start and uh niantic didn't (50:18 - 50:25)
really change it although (50:21 - 50:25)
the pokemon company didn't step in and (50:25 - 50:28)
do anything so they're just maybe they (50:26 - 50:30)
did it took this long to get that change (50:28 - 50:33)
put into place maybe it's been like what (50:30 - 50:35)
two years (50:33 - 50:37)
it's been two years nobody's mega (50:35 - 50:39)
evolving in your game do something to (50:37 - 50:41)
make it so that people will actually use (50:39 - 50:42)
that feature (50:41 - 50:44)
uh the other thing niantic has done (50:42 - 50:46)
right was the weather when weather came (50:44 - 50:47)
and (50:46 - 50:48)
there was no punishment for whether it (50:47 - 50:50)
was just hey bugs get (50:48 - 50:52)
in bugs in the rain get better bonuses (50:50 - 50:54)
dragons in the wind get better bonuses i (50:52 - 50:56)
think sometimes (50:54 - 50:58)
well not sometimes niantic does a lot of (50:56 - 51:00)
dumb stuff so the good things they do (50:58 - 51:03)
kind of get forgotten but (51:00 - 51:05)
they have done some good things (51:03 - 51:06)
um (51:05 - 51:10)
anyways uh final bit of news here (51:06 - 51:12)
because i gotta get to a haircut soon (51:10 - 51:16)
is uh pokemon go fest 2022 returns in (51:12 - 51:18)
june with new pokemon debut and new (51:16 - 51:20)
gameplay features this is off (51:18 - 51:22)
polygon.com (51:20 - 51:25)
as of us recording this this is not on (51:22 - 51:27)
niantics this is not on pokemon go live (51:25 - 51:28)
i think because (51:27 - 51:29)
um (51:28 - 51:30)
these (51:29 - 51:32)
some websites have exclusives (51:30 - 51:35)
specifically a website accidentally (51:32 - 51:36)
leaked this the day before and then had (51:35 - 51:38)
to take it down but of course once it's (51:36 - 51:39)
on the internet it's on the internet (51:38 - 51:42)
forever yep um so i think i think uh (51:39 - 51:44)
like polygon and a couple of these (51:42 - 51:46)
websites had exclusives to this but (51:44 - 51:47)
here we go (51:46 - 51:49)
um (51:47 - 51:52)
the uh two day (51:49 - 51:54)
go fest can be played with with or (51:52 - 51:57)
without tickets pokemon go fest 2022 (51:54 - 52:02)
tickets will go on sale for 14.99 (51:57 - 52:03)

expensive (52:03 - 52:08)
uh pokemon go players who will purchase (52:04 - 52:11)
polygon the oh and go is supposed to be (52:08 - 52:13)
capitalized get your branding right (52:11 - 52:14)
pokemon go players will purchase a (52:13 - 52:16)
ticket for the event we'll have an (52:14 - 52:18)
opportunity to catch rare and regional (52:16 - 52:21)
pokemon rare being axeu regional being (52:18 - 52:25)
tropius and torquel during gofest 2022 (52:21 - 52:27)
the event will also add shiny versions (52:25 - 52:31)
of shroomish numel keroblast axe u (52:27 - 52:34)
shellmet and unknown b (52:31 - 52:36)
players will also be able to catch (52:34 - 52:38)
landfor and shaman through a (52:36 - 52:40)
customizable special research during the (52:38 - 52:42)
event customizable means the players (52:40 - 52:44)
will be able to choose relaxed standard (52:42 - 52:46)
or master difficulties each with their (52:44 - 52:48)
own stickers and reward and personalized (52:46 - 52:51)
personalized gameplay experience focus (52:48 - 52:54)
sorry personalized gameplay focus either (52:51 - 52:57)
catching exploring or battling to get (52:54 - 52:59)
research tasks that suit their play (52:57 - 53:01)
style that sounds (52:59 - 53:02)
awesome (53:01 - 53:05)
i'm going to assume that if you are (53:02 - 53:05)
a (53:05 - 53:08)
relaxed player it'll be pretty easy but (53:05 - 53:10)
you probably won't get as many rewards (53:08 - 53:11)
that honestly you probably don't care (53:10 - 53:13)
about because you're as we talked about (53:11 - 53:15)
community day some people showed up they (53:13 - 53:17)
got two shinies and they left that i (53:15 - 53:20)
would consider is a relaxed player (53:17 - 53:23)
a master player is probably you played (53:20 - 53:25)
all three hours you had incense running (53:23 - 53:27)
you had lucky egg running you had your (53:25 - 53:29)
pokeball plus running and you grind it (53:27 - 53:30)
out for three hours that's probably a (53:29 - 53:33)
master difficulty (53:30 - 53:34)
but what is the difficult what is the (53:33 - 53:36)
difficulty (53:34 - 53:38)
that they don't know they haven't they (53:36 - 53:40)
haven't said yet yeah i'm just saying (53:38 - 53:42)
i'm assuming the master difficulty is (53:40 - 53:47)
more things to do but more rewards (53:42 - 53:47)
because rem let's think about when mew (53:48 - 53:52)
came out (53:50 - 53:53)
you have you have a set of players that (53:52 - 53:54)
are like (53:53 - 53:56)
i want something challenging i want i (53:54 - 53:59)
want to feel like mythical pokemon or (53:56 - 54:01)
shiny pokemon need to be earned and (53:59 - 54:02)
they're like all right from you you got (54:01 - 54:04)
to be level 40. (54:02 - 54:05)
and then you have this huge player base (54:04 - 54:07)
that was like (54:05 - 54:08)
i'm never going to get mew because i'm (54:07 - 54:10)
never going to get to 40. (54:08 - 54:12)
so you have like this (54:10 - 54:15)
you have two really distinct audiences (54:12 - 54:18)
in pokemon go you have the people who (54:15 - 54:20)
only play for like community day or only (54:18 - 54:22)
play when a new pokemon comes out and (54:20 - 54:24)
then you have the player base that play (54:22 - 54:26)
every day (54:24 - 54:28)
and they want to feel like they're (54:26 - 54:31)
accomplishing something (54:28 - 54:33)
so the fact that this go fest is going (54:31 - 54:35)

two days (60:07 - 60:11)

million percent worth the money i i i've (60:11 - 60:16)
always taken the days off i've always (60:14 - 60:18)
planned around these events to me these (60:16 - 60:20)
events are are more exciting than (60:18 - 60:23)
spending the 60 dollars to go to like uh (60:20 - 60:25)
six flags great america (60:23 - 60:27)

mcdonald's has has is not the same price (61:09 - 61:15)

like a hundred dollar day yeah it is (61:23 - 61:28)
that's disney and that is a completely (61:25 - 61:31)
different thing than a six flags (61:28 - 61:33)
you gotta go to playland go to playland (61:31 - 61:35)
park in new york what's the worst best (61:33 - 61:36)
one (61:35 - 61:38)
when's the last time you've been to a (61:36 - 61:39)
six flags (61:38 - 61:42)
um i went to six flags uh probably a (61:39 - 61:44)
couple months before the pandemic uh i (61:42 - 61:46)
went with some pokemon people (61:44 - 61:49)
and i (61:46 - 61:49)
the one in gurnee the one in chicago (61:49 - 61:53)
outside (61:51 - 61:53)
one of the people (61:55 - 62:00)
decided to get us all fast pass (61:58 - 62:02)
and there was i think four of us and i (62:00 - 62:04)
looked and it was like 800 (62:02 - 62:07)
to get the four of us fastpass and i was (62:04 - 62:09)
like blown away at their generosity (62:07 - 62:12)
and we did go on more rides (62:09 - 62:15)
we still had to wait because other (62:12 - 62:17)
people also bought fastpass (62:15 - 62:20)
but i was like this is an unreal (62:17 - 62:21)
experience like we ended up maybe going (62:20 - 62:24)
on like 14 or 15 rides in the like eight (62:21 - 62:26)
hours we were there (62:24 - 62:28)
and i was like if we didn't have this (62:26 - 62:30)
fast pass we would have maybe gone on (62:28 - 62:31)
like (62:30 - 62:33)
four rides (62:31 - 62:35)
uh i no (62:33 - 62:38)
yeah yeah no (62:35 - 62:40)
like (62:38 - 62:42)
it would maybe have gotten half but not (62:40 - 62:44)
like by that much (62:42 - 62:48)
maybe in half (62:44 - 62:48)
i don't i don't know because like all (62:48 - 62:53)
the all the good rides have the lines (62:50 - 62:55)
yeah because they're good rides (62:53 - 62:58)
[Laughter] (62:55 - 63:00)

whether they should spend 15 or not if (63:00 - 63:04)
you're missing a pancham or a shaman or (63:02 - 63:07)
a the unknown bee (63:04 - 63:09)
i like go a lot so i think the 15 is is (63:07 - 63:11)
worth it but (63:09 - 63:13)
again i'm not here to convince you (63:11 - 63:14)
otherwise like (63:13 - 63:17)
you could be the person that doesn't (63:14 - 63:19)
buy the ticket and then your friend does (63:17 - 63:21)
and they trade you the torquel and they (63:19 - 63:23)
trade you the tropius and they trade you (63:21 - 63:24)

i it would have been an easy yes if i (64:35 - 64:41)
wasn't so frustrated with niantic (64:37 - 64:44)
and i'm just loath at giving them money (64:41 - 64:47)
period right now like (64:44 - 64:48)

are speculating is ultra beast will (65:33 - 65:38)
start to appear oh (65:35 - 65:40)
makes sense because of all the alola (65:38 - 65:43)
stuff yeah yeah circuitry forever (65:40 - 65:45)

forth on that (67:12 - 67:14)

what did i say numel yes (67:17 - 67:22)
uh juan says whatever happened to the (67:28 - 67:32)
collection of pokemon games that was (67:30 - 67:35)

you act like if you just saw it on (68:05 - 68:08)
twitter (68:06 - 68:10)
or on like a facebook post or on like (68:08 - 68:11)
instagram (68:10 - 68:13)
um (68:11 - 68:15)
it seemed fine like even when i say it (68:13 - 68:16)
out loud it was like yeah that could be (68:15 - 68:18)
a thing three games two like it seems (68:16 - 68:20)
like it seems plausible but when you (68:18 - 68:22)
actually like read the like articles (68:20 - 68:25)
about it or like the i think they had (68:22 - 68:28)
like an amazon listing screenshot (68:25 - 68:29)
it was just (68:28 - 68:31)
littered with like spelling errors like (68:29 - 68:33)
even the word pokemon didn't have the (68:31 - 68:36)
accent above the e (68:33 - 68:36)
um so (68:37 - 68:43)
whether like if it was (68:40 - 68:44)
true (68:43 - 68:47)
and if it was happening (68:44 - 68:49)
the amount of information out there (68:47 - 68:52)
outweighed the cr like the reliability (68:49 - 68:54)
of what it was (68:52 - 68:57)
um so like unfortunately if you like (68:54 - 68:58)
looked into it you were like (68:57 - 69:00)
oh somebody just made this up because (68:58 - 69:01)
like (69:00 - 69:02)
they couldn't even put the work in to (69:01 - 69:05)
spell pokemon right like why why is (69:02 - 69:07)
pikachu not capitalized why is it all (69:05 - 69:10)
lowercase (69:07 - 69:10)
so that was that was kind of the problem (69:10 - 69:15)
with uh (69:12 - 69:15)
it didn't like disappear (69:15 - 69:19)
well i mean it did disappear it was just (69:17 - 69:22)
like a badly produced (69:19 - 69:24)
scam (69:22 - 69:28)
badly produced scam with no um (69:24 - 69:28)
with like no weight behind it (69:28 - 69:33)
which i guess people are saying the like (69:30 - 69:34)
gba stuff to (69:33 - 69:36)
nintendo switch (69:34 - 69:40)
has weight because of the like recent (69:36 - 69:42)
um server data mine where they saw like (69:40 - 69:47)
all these gba games got added yeah (69:42 - 69:48)
but that doesn't (69:47 - 69:51)
necessarily mean that like i mean they (69:48 - 69:53)
could add it for testing and not release (69:51 - 69:54)
it they could it could be this year it (69:53 - 69:56)
could be next year it could be never (69:54 - 69:58)
um doesn't necessarily mean that it's (69:56 - 70:00)
coming (69:58 - 70:02)
one more question here is pokemaniac (70:00 - 70:05)
asks do you think moves like discharge (70:02 - 70:07)
earthquake electric terrain should be (70:05 - 70:09)
class reclassified (70:07 - 70:13)
as stadium moves (70:09 - 70:13)
no because i don't always do them in a (70:15 - 70:19)
stadium (70:17 - 70:19)
right that makes no sense at all it's (70:20 - 70:23)
like (70:22 - 70:25)
what do we mean by stadium movies yeah (70:23 - 70:27)
like i don't is that like i think (70:25 - 70:30)
i mean by like changing the environment (70:27 - 70:31)
well earthquake doesn't change the (70:30 - 70:34)
environment (70:31 - 70:34)
like like grassy terrain and and misty (70:34 - 70:38)
terrain those are i think they're called (70:36 - 70:40)
terrain moves (70:38 - 70:41)
yeah (70:40 - 70:43)
uh there there are stadium cars in the (70:41 - 70:45)
pokemon trading card game that do affect (70:43 - 70:47)
the playing field (70:45 - 70:50)
um i think the electric terrain misty (70:47 - 70:52)
terrain grassy terrain (70:50 - 70:54)
psychic terrain (70:52 - 70:56)
i think is the last one (70:54 - 70:57)
i think those are the closest to like (70:56 - 71:00)
the stadium cards (70:57 - 71:04)
in a way yeah yeah you would get yeah um (71:00 - 71:04)
and they do they do affect like (71:05 - 71:10)
earthquake (71:08 - 71:13)
and discharge like if you have grassy (71:10 - 71:14)
terrain up (71:13 - 71:18)
i believe it directly affects earthquake (71:14 - 71:20)
and bulldoze (71:18 - 71:22)
um (71:20 - 71:25)
i mean that's fine but if i'm like (71:22 - 71:27)
standing in a field having a pokemon (71:25 - 71:30)
battle i'm not in a stadium (71:27 - 71:31)
right (71:30 - 71:33)
you can grassy terrain a wild battle if (71:31 - 71:36)
you like can can we define what a (71:33 - 71:38)
stadium yeah move i guess i don't (71:36 - 71:41)
understand the classification (71:38 - 71:42)
it's like you seem to talk about like (71:41 - 71:45)
you know what what that means what is it (71:42 - 71:46)
give me a definition because i don't (71:45 - 71:48)
understand what that means i would i (71:46 - 71:50)
would say like a stadium move or like a (71:48 - 71:53)
stadium card affects both players (71:50 - 71:56)
on the field it affects all pokemon on (71:53 - 71:58)
the field okay but why so i would say (71:56 - 72:00)
that the the electric (71:58 - 72:04)
the terrain moves are the closest to (72:00 - 72:06)
stadium cards in the tcg because it is (72:04 - 72:08)
affecting both sides no matter what yes (72:06 - 72:09)
but those are already called terrain (72:08 - 72:12)
moves yeah but what does classifying (72:09 - 72:13)
them as (72:12 - 72:14)
x move (72:13 - 72:16)
do (72:14 - 72:19)
i guess (72:16 - 72:19)
i don't under that's the part i don't (72:19 - 72:22)
understand i think it's one of those (72:21 - 72:24)
things where they want to put a (72:22 - 72:26)
classification on it just just to (72:24 - 72:28)
classify it without it actually having a (72:26 - 72:32)
purpose reason or meaning to do so (72:28 - 72:34)
yeah i think the terrain moves are (72:32 - 72:36)
for better like you could you could say (72:34 - 72:37)
stadium moves and i would know what (72:36 - 72:38)
you're talking about it's kind of you (72:37 - 72:41)
know what it kind of strikes me as like (72:38 - 72:42)
um what was that website where they (72:41 - 72:44)
would do like the competitive builds for (72:42 - 72:47)
all the pokemon for vgc what was that (72:44 - 72:49)
no no no bridge (72:47 - 72:51)
no before that (72:49 - 72:53)
uh small gun smoke on and they used to (72:51 - 72:55)
have all of their rule sets that were (72:53 - 72:57)
like these are our special smoke on rule (72:55 - 72:59)
sets that don't reflect the real i mean (72:57 - 73:03)
still exist in any way shape or form so (72:59 - 73:05)
i think it's like i want to create a (73:03 - 73:07)
classification for these types of moves (73:05 - 73:09)
so then i can create my own special rule (73:07 - 73:12)
set that says you can't create use these (73:09 - 73:14)
kinds of moves i mean i think so if (73:12 - 73:16)
we're going to say like stadium moves (73:14 - 73:19)
affect everything on the field (73:16 - 73:20)
like yeah oh i see because the (73:19 - 73:22)
earthquake effects classification then (73:20 - 73:24)
yes if we're going to say those are the (73:22 - 73:27)
classifications affects everything on (73:24 - 73:29)
the field (73:27 - 73:31)
equal stadium move then yes i think (73:29 - 73:33)
those could easily be under it (73:31 - 73:36)
um i don't know what we gain from what (73:33 - 73:38)
benefit we gain from that classification (73:36 - 73:40)
but if it's just to classify them then (73:38 - 73:41)
yeah i agree (73:40 - 73:43)
yeah i think i mean well you (73:41 - 73:45)
there are so there are sound based moves (73:43 - 73:47)
right and that is that is a (73:45 - 73:49)
classification right because they move (73:47 - 73:53)
like throat chop stops sound based moves (73:49 - 73:55)
unfortunately yawn is not a sound based (73:53 - 73:57)
move which makes no sense to me because (73:55 - 73:59)
if greg is yawning and i karate chop (73:57 - 74:01)
greg in the throat i'm sorry greg in (73:59 - 74:04)
advance you would stop yawning (74:01 - 74:04)
no (74:04 - 74:08)
oh yes also here let me do this (74:04 - 74:08)
sound did i just make but if you're mid (74:10 - 74:15)
yawn and you get throat chopped hey (74:12 - 74:17)
youtube please don't demonetize throat (74:15 - 74:19)
chop is a pokemon move (74:17 - 74:21)
if you are mid yachting and you get (74:19 - 74:25)
thrown chopped you would stop yawning (74:21 - 74:25)
yawning does not it's a it's a function (74:26 - 74:30)
of your breathing you don't stop (74:29 - 74:32)
breathing from a throat chop you crack (74:30 - 74:34)
unless it's a real i think break (74:32 - 74:36)
something if incineroar is throat (74:34 - 74:37)
chopping you greg you are not going to (74:36 - 74:39)
be able to yawn well i'm not going to be (74:37 - 74:41)
able to stand that clearly happens in (74:39 - 74:44)
pokemon (74:41 - 74:44)
they are clearly fine with being throat (74:44 - 74:48)
chopped some of them don't even have (74:46 - 74:50)
throats to chop true (74:48 - 74:53)
the the reason i i pulled this question (74:50 - 74:56)
is because there there is (74:53 - 74:57)
there (74:56 - 74:59)
i think i the reason i pulled this (74:57 - 75:01)
question is because there is there is (74:59 - 75:03)
complications in pokemon that are like (75:01 - 75:06)
really never talked about for example (75:03 - 75:08)
sound based moves there is a bunch of (75:06 - 75:09)
sound based moves and moves like throw (75:08 - 75:11)
chop affect those sound-based moves and (75:09 - 75:13)
you would have to actively look them up (75:11 - 75:17)
i can't remember every sound-based move (75:13 - 75:18)
and (75:17 - 75:21)
i think the terrain stuff in pokemon is (75:18 - 75:23)
actually really cool (75:21 - 75:26)
but in in sword and shield specifically (75:23 - 75:28)
it is so hard (75:26 - 75:30)
to remember (75:28 - 75:32)
everything like (75:30 - 75:34)
it is raining it is thunderstorming (75:32 - 75:37)
electric terrain is up oh i can barely (75:34 - 75:39)
see it misty terrain is up i can barely (75:37 - 75:41)
see it it's almost like it's cool that (75:39 - 75:44)
like they want it to feel (75:41 - 75:45)
like an atmosphere (75:44 - 75:46)
but (75:45 - 75:49)
but the amount of times i forgot that (75:46 - 75:51)
psychic terrain was up because the floor (75:49 - 75:54)
is like slightly purple and it's only (75:51 - 75:56)
slightly purple when the camera is (75:54 - 75:58)
swooping in from a certain angle and (75:56 - 75:59)
then i like try to like fake out or (75:58 - 76:01)
sucker punch and it's like i can't (75:59 - 76:03)
because psychic terrain is up but also (76:01 - 76:05)
you have to then remember that like (76:03 - 76:08)
psychic terrain prevents priority moves (76:05 - 76:13)
but also boosts psychic moves and like (76:08 - 76:16)
grassy terrain boosts grass type moves (76:13 - 76:17)
but also (76:16 - 76:19)
halves the damage from earthquake or (76:17 - 76:22)
bulldoze and like misty terrain stops (76:19 - 76:25)
status type moves but also halves dragon (76:22 - 76:28)
types moves but doesn't increase fairy (76:25 - 76:31)
type moves and electric terrain boosts (76:28 - 76:32)
electric type moves it's going to give (76:31 - 76:34)
us the whole list yeah also just like (76:32 - 76:37)
prevents sleep like and i'm and i listed (76:34 - 76:39)
all that and i'm like i'm probably (76:37 - 76:41)
forgetting some stuff (76:39 - 76:42)
um (76:41 - 76:44)
but it only matters if you care about (76:42 - 76:46)
competitive (76:44 - 76:47)
i (76:46 - 76:48)
maybe but like if you're going through (76:47 - 76:50)
the story (76:48 - 76:51)
and (76:50 - 76:54)
rihanna is setting electric terrain (76:51 - 76:56)
and you're like why didn't my spore work (76:54 - 76:58)
yeah i mean like the next time you go (76:56 - 77:00)
through you look it up and you say oh (76:58 - 77:02)
that's why (77:00 - 77:05)
there's no no need to memorize this also (77:02 - 77:07)
when a terrain is placed there's a words (77:05 - 77:10)
that come on the screen that say exactly (77:07 - 77:11)
what just happened so if you actually (77:10 - 77:13)
pay attention and read (77:11 - 77:15)
then yeah but that doesn't mean that (77:13 - 77:17)
like in a turn or two you're like oh i (77:15 - 77:19)
forgot that this is still up (77:17 - 77:22)
get better get good scrub oh my gosh (77:19 - 77:24)
remember how long these terrain moves (77:22 - 77:26)
last (77:24 - 77:27)
they're they're cool though the train (77:26 - 77:29)
stuff is really good i think they're (77:27 - 77:32)
cool i think like (77:29 - 77:35)
if the idea is if you classify them as (77:32 - 77:37)
stadium moves and then like throat chop (77:35 - 77:39)
there's a move that stops stadium moves (77:37 - 77:41)
like that's a level of complication that (77:39 - 77:43)
could be interesting (77:41 - 77:45)
um (77:43 - 77:48)
i i i i would bet (77:45 - 77:50)
a small amount of money that the reason (77:48 - 77:52)
that somebody would want to classify (77:50 - 77:54)
these moves is so that they can then say (77:52 - 77:56)
all right when i pokemon battle my (77:54 - 77:58)
friends we're not you're not allowed to (77:56 - 78:01)
use these stadium moves (77:58 - 78:01)
pokemon of the week (78:04 - 78:07)
all right last week's pokemon we got to (78:06 - 78:09)
be quick here oppalucid city jim if you (78:07 - 78:11)
didn't know what gym it was is the (78:09 - 78:12)
dragon type gym it could either have (78:11 - 78:16)
iris or drade draden as the gym leader (78:12 - 78:19)
but they use the same pokemon (78:16 - 78:21)
um two of those pokemon are related one (78:19 - 78:22)
isn't which is the one that's not (78:21 - 78:25)
related to (78:22 - 78:25)
it him (78:25 - 78:28)
[Music] (78:26 - 78:29)

axio and haxaris are related i know i (78:34 - 78:39)
just wanted to ask you because it was (78:37 - 78:41)
featured in the the yes there was like a (78:39 - 78:43)
three we call that a throwback nobody (78:41 - 78:46)
cares about fracture (78:43 - 78:49)
uh brilliant shuffle brilliant shiny (78:46 - 78:51)
the cave pokemon again oh that makes (78:49 - 78:53)
sense the cave pokemon because it (78:51 - 78:55)
appears in a cave in the isle of armor (78:53 - 78:57)
completely opposite as if you listened (78:55 - 79:00)
to my clue i said it's called (78:57 - 79:01)
uh (79:00 - 79:03)
the cave pokemon but it's only found in (79:01 - 79:06)
dragon spiral tower which is not a cave (79:03 - 79:08)
that is not a cave this is why black and (79:06 - 79:09)
white are bad games (79:08 - 79:11)
sword and shield (79:09 - 79:13)

we go this week's pokemon (79:35 - 79:40)
there are only three pokemon evolution (79:38 - 79:43)
lines that can have the ability stench (79:40 - 79:46)
as a regular not hidden ability (79:43 - 79:48)
of these only one of the lines (79:46 - 79:51)
represents an animal rather than a (79:48 - 79:54)
concept of garbage or pollution (79:51 - 79:56)
both of the pokemon in this line (79:54 - 80:00)
resemble cheek squeak from yokai watch (79:56 - 80:02)
but only one of them shares the first (80:00 - 80:04)
part of its name with a ground electric (80:02 - 80:09)
or ground steel kind of fish (80:04 - 80:09)
basket one (80:11 - 80:14)
we will be back next week thank you for (80:14 - 80:19)

there's no e3 but that doesn't mean (80:45 - 80:48)
there's not going to be game (80:48 - 80:51)
