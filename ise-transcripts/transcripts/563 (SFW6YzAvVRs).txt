third episode of the Pokemon podcast (0:26 - 0:30)
it's super effective I'm your host Steve (0:28 - 0:34)
with me is Greg hello I'm here with a (0:30 - 0:37)
public service announcement (0:34 - 0:41)
chandelure's unite move is too loud oh (0:37 - 0:42)
it is (0:41 - 0:46)
it makes you jump it is so like it is (0:42 - 0:48)
I'm pretty sure it's louder than (0:46 - 0:52)
clefairy's Moonlight which was obnoxious (0:48 - 0:55)
and it's louder than deralidon's release (0:52 - 0:58)
when I heard it I thought people were (0:55 - 0:59)
joking I'm like oh it can't be I heard (0:58 - 1:01)
it the first time I'm like what just (0:59 - 1:04)
happened it's terrifying we need a bug (1:01 - 1:05)
fix (1:04 - 1:07)
immediately is it to the point where (1:05 - 1:08)
it's actually painful (1:07 - 1:10)
painful yes (1:08 - 1:12)
if you're wearing headphones I'm like I (1:10 - 1:13)
don't know how you're not (1:12 - 1:16)
had a hearing loss at this point it is (1:13 - 1:18)
so loud (1:16 - 1:21)
Hannah also here (1:18 - 1:23)
yeah I have nothing as exciting as that (1:21 - 1:26)
my cat's not as uh unhappy about the (1:23 - 1:27)
apartment anymore she is starting to (1:26 - 1:28)
adjust (1:27 - 1:30)
yay (1:28 - 1:33)
welcome to the new world Kitty I was (1:30 - 1:36)
gonna say welcome to cat updates (1:33 - 1:38)
we had moving updates Now we move around (1:36 - 1:40)
to cat updates (1:38 - 1:42)
the most exciting things in my world (1:40 - 1:43)
right now okay that's okay (1:42 - 1:46)
until we get a new Pokemon game (1:43 - 1:50)
or the the updates the DLC yeah that's (1:46 - 1:53)
November yeah it's maybe October you (1:50 - 1:55)
know whenever (1:53 - 1:55)
could be sooner could be it was meant to (1:57 - 2:01)
be a summer one (1:59 - 2:05)
um well speaking of Summer uh Niantic is (2:01 - 2:07)
starting to unveil their summer plans so (2:05 - 2:08)
we actually have a lot of Pokemon go (2:07 - 2:10)
news after not talking about Pokemon go (2:08 - 2:11)
for the last (2:10 - 2:13)
three weeks or something like that it's (2:11 - 2:16)
been a while uh so a little bit of a (2:13 - 2:18)
Pokemon go heavy episode and then uh in (2:16 - 2:20)
Italian (2:18 - 2:23)
was announced shortly after we hit the (2:20 - 2:26)
stop recording last week and then they (2:23 - 2:29)
they decided not to give us any time off (2:26 - 2:31)
they're just like you like raids because (2:29 - 2:34)
every other week is the new raid (2:31 - 2:36)
I mean we're now into this pattern right (2:34 - 2:39)
like Italian's done and then which one's (2:36 - 2:41)
coming next are we assuming okay so (2:39 - 2:42)
um (2:41 - 2:45)
there there are a specific Pokemon in (2:42 - 2:48)
the code this was the same for for sword (2:45 - 2:50)
and shield where we we knew that like (2:48 - 2:52)
Snorlax was in the code as a gigantic (2:50 - 2:54)
Max but he wasn't available right away (2:52 - 2:55)
and then I think like 30 days later (2:54 - 2:57)
Snorlax is available I also knew like (2:55 - 2:59)
gigantom X Mel metal was in the code but (2:57 - 3:03)
they saved that for the DLC (2:59 - 3:06)
in the game the entire time (3:03 - 3:08)
um but like Venusaur and Blastoise were (3:06 - 3:10)
not in base sword and shield they were (3:08 - 3:12)
added to (3:10 - 3:15)
uh the DLC so what is left in the code (3:12 - 3:18)
besides like most legendary Pokemon like (3:15 - 3:20)
Mewtwo is in the code (3:18 - 3:22)
um is (3:20 - 3:26)
I almost said incinero gosh I wish uh (3:22 - 3:27)
rila boom (3:26 - 3:31)
is left Delphox is left and Chestnut is (3:27 - 3:35)
left so sorry to any Empoleon lovers (3:31 - 3:38)
Meganium lovers for that they're not in (3:35 - 3:42)
the game at all yet yet (3:38 - 3:46)
uh I'm I'm sure when the DLC comes I I (3:42 - 3:48)
feel like the safest bet in the entire (3:46 - 3:50)
world is Blastoise and Venus or will (3:48 - 3:53)
definitely be part of the DLC absolutely (3:50 - 3:57)
gotta satisfy Kanto lovers you got to (3:53 - 4:02)
uh so by patterns do we think fire is (3:57 - 4:04)
next do we think they're gonna do (4:02 - 4:06)
Delphox I feel like they got to do (4:04 - 4:08)
Chestnut next you can't save him for (4:06 - 4:10)
last no one likes him (4:08 - 4:12)
you save him for last one home (4:10 - 4:14)
Integrations right around the corners we (4:12 - 4:15)
were like I don't have to do this I'm (4:14 - 4:18)
just gonna impart the one that I got (4:15 - 4:21)
um look Will Will loves Chespin so like (4:18 - 4:24)
I feel like (4:21 - 4:24)
there's a little love out there it's a (4:24 - 4:29)
big paladiny Pokemon yeah but will (4:26 - 4:32)
doesn't like raids (4:29 - 4:35)
look if we're gonna hit her and list the (4:32 - 4:36)
thought of things that will doesn't like (4:35 - 4:39)
we're gonna be here for 15 hours that's (4:36 - 4:41)
true (4:39 - 4:43)
um hey well well was ambitious enough to (4:41 - 4:47)
come out for uh commute day (4:43 - 4:49)
and it's broken it has broken foot oh (4:47 - 4:52)
and he got it he he did a couple laps (4:49 - 4:55)
for a swine up he he did yeah yeah yeah (4:52 - 4:57)
it was just it was just me and will at (4:55 - 4:59)
the mall I have I've been to I meant to (4:57 - 5:01)
come and then I got held up and I'm like (4:59 - 5:03)
oh by the time I left this place and (5:01 - 5:05)
drove out to the Mall of America it's (5:03 - 5:06)
done (5:05 - 5:08)
I'm not making it okay here's the thing (5:06 - 5:11)
will (5:08 - 5:13)
doesn't listen to me go to Twitter and (5:11 - 5:14)
look at his tweet because he finally (5:13 - 5:16)
admitted he should listen to me he was (5:14 - 5:17)
explaining what happened I said will you (5:16 - 5:19)
broke your foot he's like I don't think (5:17 - 5:21)
I did I said will you have broken your (5:19 - 5:24)
foot but trust me when I tell you (5:21 - 5:26)
you broke your foot he's like nah it's (5:24 - 5:30)
fine I said fine fine don't listen to me (5:26 - 5:34)
what happened he broke his foot oh (5:30 - 5:36)
he broke it for that now he knows for (5:34 - 5:37)
the listeners he broke it moving (5:36 - 5:40)
furniture because he just moved yes (5:37 - 5:43)
um he stubbed his toe like little toes (5:40 - 5:44)
break all the time both of my little (5:43 - 5:45)
toes are broken from when I was a kid (5:44 - 5:46)
and what do they do they're like let's (5:45 - 5:49)
put a boot on you and have fun it's (5:46 - 5:51)
it'll heal (5:49 - 5:52)
uh so yeah we have we have three Pokemon (5:51 - 5:54)
left (5:52 - 5:57)
um I guess if they're not repeating any (5:54 - 5:59)
Terror types (5:57 - 6:02)
um what do we got we got like fairy dark (5:59 - 6:05)
ground fighting has already been used (6:02 - 6:08)
um (6:05 - 6:08)
ghost has been used I think I think (6:08 - 6:13)
fairy makes the most sense for Delphox (6:11 - 6:17)
because ideally if Delphox is fairy (6:13 - 6:20)
fairy is weak to poison but delphox's (6:17 - 6:23)
natural type is psychic and then if (6:20 - 6:25)
Delphox is also weak to steal because (6:23 - 6:28)
steel or fairies weak to steal delphox's (6:25 - 6:31)
other natural type is fire so yeah I (6:28 - 6:33)
think that makes the most sense (6:31 - 6:36)
uh gorilla boom is like kind of weird I (6:33 - 6:40)
guess like if gorilla boom was ground (6:36 - 6:43)
you would bring water or grass and he (6:40 - 6:45)
has a counter for water which is grass (6:43 - 6:48)
he doesn't really have a counter for (6:45 - 6:50)
grass so that (6:48 - 6:53)
I don't think makes I don't know it's (6:50 - 6:55)
really good maybe it was a tough one to (6:53 - 6:57)
figure out dark see like every there (6:55 - 6:58)
were there were so many people that were (6:57 - 7:01)
like why is Samurai bug but it like made (6:58 - 7:03)
so much sense it it like had (7:01 - 7:08)
counters to yeah the bus there is some (7:03 - 7:10)
logic there yeah because Grill room is (7:08 - 7:12)
just pure grass type right I'm not (7:10 - 7:13)
making that up yeah yeah yeah no real (7:12 - 7:16)
boom it's just grass gorilla boom does (7:13 - 7:19)
get access to Boom burst which is like a (7:16 - 7:22)
140 normal type move but really boom's (7:19 - 7:25)
special attack is so bad and that's a (7:22 - 7:27)
special attack so I don't think normal (7:25 - 7:30)
type really boom is even (7:27 - 7:33)
exciting but I guess boom burst would (7:30 - 7:35)
make sense if they were going for like a (7:33 - 7:36)
theme of (7:35 - 7:38)
yeah music (7:36 - 7:40)
I mean it's (7:38 - 7:42)
special attack is (7:40 - 7:46)
real real bad yeah it's it's 60 where (7:42 - 7:51)
it's attack is oh and 25. yeah yeah yeah (7:46 - 7:53)
I mean I feel like (7:51 - 7:57)
it's level up moveset is not it has (7:53 - 7:59)
never been all that exciting like it's a (7:57 - 8:02)
lot of normal (7:59 - 8:02)
okay they could this this this this is (8:02 - 8:08)
my they could make gorilla boom electric (8:05 - 8:10)
which would kind of make sense because (8:08 - 8:13)
like drummers need to like plug they (8:10 - 8:15)
don't well micro Mike the stage you plug (8:13 - 8:18)
in everything but okay so this is hear (8:15 - 8:20)
me out hear me out they make it electric (8:18 - 8:23)
electric is only weak to ground but (8:20 - 8:25)
because gorilla boom's ability is Grassy (8:23 - 8:27)
surge (8:25 - 8:30)
most some ground type moves get reduced (8:27 - 8:33)
in grassy surge so like earthquake (8:30 - 8:35)
and I think it's like high horsepower do (8:33 - 8:39)
half the damage in grassy surge (8:35 - 8:42)
uh okay (8:39 - 8:44)
and if they bring ground (8:42 - 8:47)
s naturally super effective against that (8:44 - 8:50)
because it's grass (8:47 - 8:51)
I don't think it gets a single electric (8:50 - 8:53)
type move though so Terra blasted no it (8:51 - 8:56)
does not I (8:53 - 8:58)
um (8:56 - 8:58)
looking in here nope (8:59 - 9:04)
I don't think we've had an electric (9:04 - 9:07)
chair it's not a really not great (9:05 - 9:10)
moveset yeah really boom's moveset's (9:07 - 9:14)
very it was very good in uh in sword and (9:10 - 9:15)
shield but I believe they removed (9:14 - 9:20)
knockoff they removed yeah grassy glass (9:15 - 9:20)
I don't remember if it no super power I (9:21 - 9:27)
think it got superpower (9:24 - 9:29)
in gen (9:27 - 9:32)
eight (9:29 - 9:32)
you get sunny day yeah get stomp in (9:32 - 9:37)
Chandra (9:34 - 9:37)
anyways uh got drain punch (9:38 - 9:42)
okay (9:41 - 9:45)
and then Chestnut is normally grass (9:42 - 9:47)
fighting so (9:45 - 9:50)
that's gonna be psychic type (9:47 - 9:52)
that do we already have a psychic I (9:50 - 9:54)
don't like I'm I am paying little (9:52 - 9:56)
attention to what I'm saying okay (9:54 - 9:59)
so um (9:56 - 9:59)
it feels weird because like if they were (10:00 - 10:06)
going at their pace of like one it was (10:03 - 10:08)
like it was like one every three weeks (10:06 - 10:09)
we were we were saying like once a month (10:08 - 10:11)
but realistically it was like once every (10:09 - 10:12)
three weeks if they were going at that (10:11 - 10:15)
pace that would have taken us to DLC but (10:12 - 10:18)
then for whatever reason they were like (10:15 - 10:20)
that's pick up the pace pick up the pace (10:18 - 10:23)
so now we only have three left (10:20 - 10:25)
and we have all some I guess they could (10:23 - 10:26)
repeat (10:25 - 10:29)
but they already repeat this we're going (10:26 - 10:32)
to have to repeat some yeah right like (10:29 - 10:35)
uh I I feel like (10:32 - 10:37)
we are facing the their weird decision (10:35 - 10:41)
to have these in raids (10:37 - 10:44)
before they do home connection right (10:41 - 10:47)
which again (10:44 - 10:50)
why do you I don't understand why they (10:47 - 10:51)
care about (10:50 - 10:54)
people breaking in things from home (10:51 - 10:56)
after the game has been out for almost (10:54 - 10:58)
six months now (10:56 - 11:01)
it's a (10:58 - 11:01)
they go into like player game this way (11:01 - 11:07)
and do our rules uh and get them the way (11:04 - 11:10)
that we want this way only (11:07 - 11:10)
just bizarre yeah and it's also like (11:11 - 11:18)
it's like a vocal minority right (11:15 - 11:21)
like how many people (11:18 - 11:21)
are playing this game daily and still (11:23 - 11:28)
like dying for home besides like the the (11:26 - 11:31)
like 200 people that are screaming every (11:28 - 11:34)
day at Joe Serebii on Twitter for it I (11:31 - 11:35)
feel like almost anybody who's still (11:34 - 11:37)
playing this game daily would could (11:35 - 11:41)
benefit from yeah yeah totally yeah but (11:37 - 11:42)
like I don't (11:41 - 11:44)
I don't know if there's like a person (11:42 - 11:48)
out there who like finished the the they (11:44 - 11:50)
got credits and they're like gosh I'm (11:48 - 11:53)
waiting to bring my (11:50 - 11:56)
grooky over so I can like (11:53 - 11:58)
spin in circles and breed it like I (11:56 - 12:00)
think that's such a (11:58 - 12:04)
breeding is so not fun in this game (12:00 - 12:07)
you need home to mass release oh you do (12:04 - 12:10)
need home to mass really believe me but (12:07 - 12:13)
even even like Greg's Point like okay (12:10 - 12:16)
the home comes out tomorrow so and then (12:13 - 12:19)
gorilla boom comes out after that like I (12:16 - 12:21)
I still want to do the rilla boom (12:19 - 12:23)
because I think that the The Raid is fun (12:21 - 12:25)
and I want the rilla boom with the (12:23 - 12:27)
mighty Mark and I'm pretty sure that (12:25 - 12:29)
would be the first time you could get (12:27 - 12:31)
grooky in (12:29 - 12:34)
an apricorn ball right so there's like (12:31 - 12:36)
like they they created their own like (12:34 - 12:38)
this is still worth doing if you have it (12:36 - 12:41)
system which is great that's like super (12:38 - 12:43)
good for them to create that and then (12:41 - 12:47)
they're like it doesn't matter if people (12:43 - 12:49)
could move their grookies over because (12:47 - 12:51)
there's there's still an audience that (12:49 - 12:53)
and even if you're like I hate raids if (12:51 - 12:55)
your name is Will and you're like I hate (12:53 - 12:58)
raids once I did the grookie I could (12:55 - 13:01)
just trade him an egg right (12:58 - 13:07)
yeah I don't understand like I don't (13:01 - 13:10)
this is one of those I always feel like (13:07 - 13:12)
this is one of those times when you go (13:10 - 13:13)
into a corporation and you're like why (13:12 - 13:15)
do you do it this way like well we've (13:13 - 13:18)
always done it this way and you're like (13:15 - 13:22)
okay but why and there that is it we've (13:18 - 13:24)
always done it this way and that is the (13:22 - 13:26)
reason because it doesn't make a ton of (13:24 - 13:28)
sense (13:26 - 13:30)
whatever (13:28 - 13:30)
yeah I uh I don't know it's (13:32 - 13:38)
speaking of rides I guess let's let's (13:36 - 13:40)
get in Italian out of the way until Ian (13:38 - 13:41)
showed up (13:40 - 13:46)
uh yep it's uh it went PPP uh you know (13:41 - 13:51)
ice is a very bad territory ice is just (13:46 - 13:53)
a bad type in general (13:51 - 13:57)
it's just not good Ice uh also only has (13:53 - 13:59)
one resistance (13:57 - 14:02)
and that is ice ice resist ice (13:59 - 14:05)
so there's a lot there's a lot it's uh (14:02 - 14:07)
not not doing it had a cool moveset (14:05 - 14:11)
though um uh it had snipe shot of course (14:07 - 14:13)
uh with the ability sniper they had a (14:11 - 14:15)
blizzard and snowscape so it's like a (14:13 - 14:17)
really cool combo (14:15 - 14:18)
um (14:17 - 14:19)
because snowscape is different than hail (14:18 - 14:22)
I think most people like the changes (14:19 - 14:25)
from hail to snow Escape although yeah (14:22 - 14:29)
they did frostbite in Legends Arceus and (14:25 - 14:33)
that didn't come back uh nah I should (14:29 - 14:35)
have though yeah frostbite is kind of (14:33 - 14:36)
cool (14:35 - 14:38)
um also they had late enough sleep in (14:36 - 14:41)
Legends Arceus they had like drowsy not (14:38 - 14:43)
to be confused with the Pokemon (14:41 - 14:46)
what was it called drowsy I don't think (14:43 - 14:48)
so I think it had a different name (14:46 - 14:50)
maybe that's something yeah it was (14:48 - 14:52)
different though (14:50 - 14:53)
yeah but you weren't you weren't fully (14:52 - 14:55)
asleep it was like 50 50 of whether you (14:53 - 14:58)
were attacking or like dozing was it (14:55 - 15:00)
called dozing what's it called I can't (14:58 - 15:03)
remember what it's called (15:00 - 15:05)
I don't (15:03 - 15:08)
know it was it had a name intellion also (15:05 - 15:11)
had a tearful look which lowers both (15:08 - 15:14)
your attack and your special attack it (15:11 - 15:15)
was called drowsy (15:14 - 15:18)
not to be confused with the Pokemon (15:15 - 15:20)
uh (15:18 - 15:24)
and then it had hey uh Mist not to be (15:20 - 15:25)
confused with Haze (15:24 - 15:28)
um so Mist would prevent (15:25 - 15:31)
you from using moves like acid spray or (15:28 - 15:33)
snarl or (15:31 - 15:35)
um (15:33 - 15:35)
mud slap (15:38 - 15:41)
um you could still use those moves and (15:40 - 15:42)
they would still do damage they just (15:41 - 15:44)
wouldn't have the secondary status (15:42 - 15:46)
effects (15:44 - 15:48)
so it was pretty cool uh in the sense (15:46 - 15:50)
like I think I think like (15:48 - 15:53)
what it was trying to do for those maybe (15:50 - 15:55)
you know who did it once and then never (15:53 - 15:57)
did it again I it was it was ultimately (15:55 - 16:00)
trying to prevent like a a (15:57 - 16:03)
One-Shot strategy right it was it was it (16:00 - 16:06)
was designed to just slow you down (16:03 - 16:07)
um and I think it did that successfully (16:06 - 16:10)
whether or not like you were like well I (16:07 - 16:11)
just sat there and I just hit drain (16:10 - 16:13)
punch over and over yeah sure but like (16:11 - 16:16)
it still did its theme of like slowing (16:13 - 16:18)
you down that's that's really all unless (16:16 - 16:19)
you had defiant then I guess it was (16:18 - 16:21)
triggering your defiant with tearfully (16:19 - 16:24)
but yeah (16:21 - 16:24)
um there's not like a lot of defoggers (16:24 - 16:29)
there was a way to remove the The Mists (16:26 - 16:32)
um and like corvinite and frost moth I (16:29 - 16:33)
think were like the the two best (16:32 - 16:35)
defoggers that you could do so there (16:33 - 16:37)
were raising around it (16:35 - 16:38)
um (16:37 - 16:41)
and it's interesting I don't again your (16:38 - 16:43)
mileage varied on how easy or difficult (16:41 - 16:45)
it was I just brought (16:43 - 16:47)
look I love Gardevoir I just made a (16:45 - 16:49)
Gardevoir and (16:47 - 16:52)
sunny day skill Swap and then heals with (16:49 - 16:54)
life too because there was a lot of (16:52 - 16:56)
really bad randoms (16:54 - 17:01)
uh game game raid still buggy still not (16:56 - 17:03)
not great to sit in though sometimes (17:01 - 17:05)
when you're like what is happening why (17:03 - 17:07)
can't I move I I see anything it all (17:05 - 17:11)
freezes I do feel like instead okay so I (17:07 - 17:13)
I think it is better but in a different (17:11 - 17:16)
way (17:13 - 17:16)
s (17:18 - 17:22)
before they fixed it I felt like you (17:19 - 17:24)
really didn't get stuck unless you went (17:22 - 17:26)
into the cheer menu and it was always (17:24 - 17:28)
like when you went into the cheer menu (17:26 - 17:30)
when somebody else was cheering is when (17:28 - 17:32)
it did for sure get stuck (17:30 - 17:34)
so like you would go over to heel cheer (17:32 - 17:36)
and then somebody you would see like the (17:34 - 17:39)
green lines pop up and then I was like (17:36 - 17:41)
oh no I'm about to get stuck and then I (17:39 - 17:45)
did and the only way I got unstuck was (17:41 - 17:48)
when like the boss like the Camera Pants (17:45 - 17:50)
the boss when the boss like clears that (17:48 - 17:53)
was like the only way I got unstuck (17:50 - 17:56)
ever since (17:53 - 17:57)
like one point (17:56 - 17:59)
two (17:57 - 18:03)
a little after 1.2 I've I felt like you (17:59 - 18:06)
don't get stuck there anymore but what (18:03 - 18:08)
it does is like the whole raid will have (18:06 - 18:11)
this really long pause (18:08 - 18:13)
and everyone just sits there and is (18:11 - 18:15)
awaiting at the same time so you're not (18:13 - 18:17)
stuck in a menu you're just kind of like (18:15 - 18:19)
looking at all five Pokemon on screen (18:17 - 18:21)
being like (18:19 - 18:24)
what's what what hello hello and then (18:21 - 18:27)
like and then it like all resumes so I (18:24 - 18:31)
think that was their like temporary fix (18:27 - 18:32)
unless I'm just like making things up (18:31 - 18:37)
but I've noticed that like huge pause (18:32 - 18:37)
are you certain that other people are (18:37 - 18:42)
experiencing it at the same time (18:40 - 18:47)
yeah we don't know also (18:42 - 18:50)
I love getting stuck where my camera is (18:47 - 18:52)
mostly in the floor oh yeah that's it (18:50 - 18:54)
and I'm just I'm just getting up shots (18:52 - 18:56)
of everybody's skirts for no good reason (18:54 - 19:00)
like what is happening and the weird (18:56 - 19:02)
thing is that (19:00 - 19:05)
like you can see move animations go (19:02 - 19:07)
through the floor in super weird ways (19:05 - 19:11)
I'm like what is why am I here (19:07 - 19:13)
paying attention (19:11 - 19:16)
yeah I guess (19:13 - 19:16)
they're like look they're better in like (19:16 - 19:21)
the sake of like (19:20 - 19:25)
two percent better (19:21 - 19:25)
it's in the proof (19:26 - 19:30)
you present better (19:32 - 19:35)
um (19:34 - 19:38)
I mean meanwhile I can't move through a (19:35 - 19:40)
menu and unite to save my soul so how's (19:38 - 19:41)
that like (19:40 - 19:44)
none of it's great right now (19:41 - 19:48)
uh but yeah I I (19:44 - 19:48)
intellian was fine (19:48 - 19:51)
um (19:51 - 19:54)
like it's opening moves I'm like oh it's (19:51 - 19:58)
doing this but I'm sort of (19:54 - 19:58)
if we now have like the sort of weird (19:58 - 20:03)
pattern that I hope they break of two (20:01 - 20:05)
quick sudden moves how are you gonna (20:03 - 20:08)
deal with it it's like okay so like we (20:05 - 20:10)
just are now waiting for the first (20:08 - 20:11)
person to do it to find out what the two (20:10 - 20:13)
quick sudden moves are and then how to (20:11 - 20:16)
immediately counteract what it just did (20:13 - 20:21)
right like oh throw up sunny day (20:16 - 20:21)
yeah but (20:21 - 20:25)
literally if one person did that it made (20:25 - 20:30)
the whole raid ten times easier at least (20:27 - 20:33)
two percent easier some would say it was (20:30 - 20:36)
like if you could taunt decidueye so it (20:33 - 20:39)
couldn't do its Swords Dance at Shields (20:36 - 20:42)
like it made it a lot easier (20:39 - 20:43)
like once you start to figure out the (20:42 - 20:45)
pattern but that is the way of raids (20:43 - 20:46)
though once you figure out the pattern (20:45 - 20:48)
it's easy yeah I mean that's that is (20:46 - 20:51)
that is just how raids are that's the (20:48 - 20:52)
puzzle (20:51 - 20:55)
I just think I would like a different (20:52 - 20:56)
I would like a different beginning (20:55 - 20:58)
puzzle for some of these other ones (20:56 - 21:00)
instead of like it's gonna do two things (20:58 - 21:02)
right away that you can't react to I (21:00 - 21:05)
don't like mine that because it does (21:02 - 21:08)
like in in the case of intelli like (21:05 - 21:10)
you know I you look back at Old raids (21:08 - 21:14)
and like or or or most situations in (21:10 - 21:15)
Pokemon if you're playing with a group (21:14 - 21:17)
and you have four people it's like okay (21:15 - 21:19)
this one's a special attacker so (21:17 - 21:20)
somebody said light screen this one's a (21:19 - 21:21)
physical attacker somebody said reflect (21:20 - 21:23)
there's like really no reason to do that (21:21 - 21:25)
unless in the situation of Samurai (21:23 - 21:26)
you're like well this is pointless (21:25 - 21:27)
because he's just gonna cut through (21:26 - 21:29)
anyways but it's like okay well somebody (21:27 - 21:33)
somebody set up a screen okay somebody (21:29 - 21:35)
start using acid spray or somebody start (21:33 - 21:37)
using I don't know like bulk up or Hal (21:35 - 21:40)
or right like like (21:37 - 21:43)
when this was the first raid boss that (21:40 - 21:45)
was like you can't do that to me because (21:43 - 21:48)
I'm setting Miss right and I'm doing it (21:45 - 21:50)
before you can even taunt (21:48 - 21:52)
so I I think that is that is cool (21:50 - 21:54)
obviously there is a move that gets (21:52 - 21:56)
around that that move is defog but (21:54 - 21:58)
you're very limited to Pokemon choices (21:56 - 22:00)
and it just happened that the two (21:58 - 22:02)
Pokemon that got defog (22:00 - 22:05)
we're pretty okay against (22:02 - 22:08)
intellion so I don't (22:05 - 22:11)
I don't mind the like two (22:08 - 22:13)
you like decidue I didn't have that at (22:11 - 22:15)
all though but like the the two moves (22:13 - 22:18)
before the turn Zero moves I guess (22:15 - 22:19)
um I guess if they wanted to make it (22:18 - 22:22)
like harder even though I think they are (22:19 - 22:24)
hard enough like again just go online (22:22 - 22:26)
with with randoms and you'll be like oh (22:24 - 22:31)
well this level 83 uh (22:26 - 22:33)
the fridgey fridge is not going to be (22:31 - 22:34)
able to do anything like we just we're (22:33 - 22:36)
just Auto losing here or this like level (22:34 - 22:39)
59 tinkerton is is getting one shot by (22:36 - 22:41)
everything even with sun up and light (22:39 - 22:43)
screen and reflect and like (22:41 - 22:45)
um (22:43 - 22:47)
so I think they're hard enough I don't (22:45 - 22:48)
think that's the problem but if they (22:47 - 22:50)
wanted to make them harder which I think (22:48 - 22:53)
a lot of raids go into like Destiny has (22:50 - 22:56)
a harder version of the same exact raid (22:53 - 22:58)
Final Fantasy has a harder version World (22:56 - 22:59)
of Warcraft has a harder they're the (22:58 - 23:00)
same (22:59 - 23:02)
raid it's just like this is the hard (23:00 - 23:04)
mode right (23:02 - 23:07)
if they wanted to make them harder the (23:04 - 23:12)
AI needs to be just smarter like the the (23:07 - 23:15)
AI at least in this case with intellion (23:12 - 23:18)
when you use tearful look against a (23:15 - 23:20)
defiant Pokemon you are actually giving (23:18 - 23:23)
it an advantage so if the if the AI was (23:20 - 23:25)
smart enough to be like oh you have (23:23 - 23:28)
something that counters (23:25 - 23:30)
uh (23:28 - 23:33)
tearful look we're not going to use (23:30 - 23:35)
tearful look on you but we're going to (23:33 - 23:39)
use it on the other Pokemon and if I am (23:35 - 23:42)
setting Sun the boss should be like no (23:39 - 23:45)
no no no I'm going to reset snow (23:42 - 23:49)
uh because it only sets no like exactly (23:45 - 23:53)
like five turns later or something so I (23:49 - 23:56)
could see them and they and again it was (23:53 - 23:58)
like well (23:56 - 24:00)
if they can do two moves for free before (23:58 - 24:02)
you even do one they can they can (24:00 - 24:06)
introduce that in multiple steps to make (24:02 - 24:09)
it harder if they wanted to (24:06 - 24:10)
um I do think that would be cool though (24:09 - 24:13)
to have like a even harder (24:10 - 24:15)
version of the race for those that just (24:13 - 24:17)
want to do that like those that want to (24:15 - 24:20)
chord I think you know you (24:17 - 24:22)
you do see people come up with like oh I (24:20 - 24:25)
did like anger Point Tauros Frost last (24:22 - 24:27)
power spot Stone Journal like like you (24:25 - 24:30)
see four people coordinate like how can (24:27 - 24:31)
we do the most damage and that's like (24:30 - 24:34)
fun to those people right to like figure (24:31 - 24:35)
out that puzzle (24:34 - 24:38)
um so (24:35 - 24:41)
but I I guess three steps back uh we (24:38 - 24:44)
still get stuck in raids so wow (24:41 - 24:47)
we should have done a competitive (24:44 - 24:49)
ability (24:47 - 24:52)
uh kilowattroll and made that work do (24:49 - 24:55)
that for the next weekend (24:52 - 24:57)
give yourself a challenge electric (24:55 - 24:59)
flying it's got competitive (24:57 - 25:01)
I mean (24:59 - 25:04)
we've made a spoink work because it had (25:01 - 25:06)
thick fat and we put a salt vest on it (25:04 - 25:08)
and he was just this little piggy doing (25:06 - 25:09)
like snarl over and over because we were (25:08 - 25:12)
able to defog it it's like you could (25:09 - 25:13)
make a lot of cool Pokemon words you can (25:12 - 25:15)
make a lot of things (25:13 - 25:17)
also part of the fun (25:15 - 25:19)
I'm gonna challenge you the Lister to do (25:17 - 25:22)
a kilowattroll intellion (25:19 - 25:26)
I I remember seeing a uh like a video on (25:22 - 25:29)
Reddit that was for Pikachu taking out (25:26 - 25:32)
the Seven Star Pikachu when that came (25:29 - 25:34)
and that was like really cute and really (25:32 - 25:38)
fun yeah so I and again it's like (25:34 - 25:40)
the great thing about Pokemon is you can (25:38 - 25:42)
make it as challenging or as difficult (25:40 - 25:45)
as you want like yep you can go in and (25:42 - 25:48)
you can hit drain punch over and over (25:45 - 25:50)
with the nylape or you can bring a (25:48 - 25:53)
finian and put an evil light on it and (25:50 - 25:54)
use (25:53 - 25:58)
missed use your own Mist again (25:54 - 25:58)
uh I guess against Italian (25:59 - 26:02)
okay (26:03 - 26:05)
um (26:05 - 26:08)
well we'll we'll see we'll see what they (26:05 - 26:13)
do next for we got well Italian repeats (26:08 - 26:15)
uh for the the next week let me look at (26:13 - 26:17)
my calendar here uh so Italian will (26:15 - 26:20)
repeat the fourth or technically the (26:17 - 26:22)
fifth through the eighth (26:20 - 26:25)
um when this podcast goes up uh walking (26:22 - 26:27)
wake and iron leaves should be back in (26:25 - 26:30)
raids and they'll run for two weeks (26:27 - 26:33)
if you wow if you've already caught it (26:30 - 26:36)
you can't catch it again (26:33 - 26:36)
um you can still do them uh they are (26:36 - 26:43)
level 75 so most level 100 should be (26:39 - 26:45)
okay (26:43 - 26:47)
I can't remember off the top of my head (26:45 - 26:49)
I think golden go was pretty good (26:47 - 26:52)
against (26:49 - 26:52)
um Iron leaves (26:52 - 26:56)
and then (26:55 - 26:58)
I think belly bolt was pretty good (26:56 - 27:00)
against walking wake I think belly I (26:58 - 27:04)
think walking awake was Pure Water right (27:00 - 27:05)
don't remember that but I remember my (27:04 - 27:08)
belly bolt was great yeah I think well (27:05 - 27:09)
it's water dragon but I think it's water (27:08 - 27:12)
Terror type if I remember okay yeah yeah (27:09 - 27:13)
yeah (27:12 - 27:15)
um (27:13 - 27:17)
those were just I I'll put up a counter (27:15 - 27:19)
graphic but those were like the top two (27:17 - 27:21)
I remember like not struggling at all (27:19 - 27:24)
with those Pokemon I look forward to (27:21 - 27:25)
them eventually getting Pokedex entries (27:24 - 27:28)
someday (27:25 - 27:31)
the DLC and where they'll probably be (27:28 - 27:33)
like 300 of them walking around in the (27:31 - 27:35)
wild (27:33 - 27:35)
okay so walking away coming back walking (27:35 - 27:39)
away iron leaves coming back in Italian (27:37 - 27:43)
coming back Global Challenge three (27:39 - 27:45)
starts on the fifth and goes to the (27:43 - 27:47)
eighth so three different things you can (27:45 - 27:49)
do this weekend I suppose walking wake (27:47 - 27:53)
Italian iron leaves Global challenge or (27:49 - 27:55)
you can go to magiccon Minneapolis (27:53 - 27:57)
because that's where I'll be oh yeah (27:55 - 27:59)
that's this weekend did that sell out (27:57 - 28:01)
this is a coming weekend (27:59 - 28:03)
they didn't sell out right (28:01 - 28:06)
I don't think so okay yeah yeah (28:03 - 28:09)
um I realized there was a 24-hour diner (28:06 - 28:11)
across from that convention center and (28:09 - 28:12)
it's pretty good I can't remember what (28:11 - 28:13)
it's called (28:12 - 28:15)
a little expensive though I'm always (28:13 - 28:17)
looking for 24-Hour places (28:15 - 28:19)
I know because you have the most messed (28:17 - 28:21)
up sleep yeah yeah yeah yeah (28:19 - 28:23)
you're like where could I go to eat at (28:21 - 28:26)
3am that isn't McDonald's because people (28:23 - 28:29)
should be asleep no I need to support (28:26 - 28:32)
those third shift workers so yeah you (28:29 - 28:33)
should make it so that they don't have (28:32 - 28:36)
to work the third shift let them let (28:33 - 28:38)
them live like we need to have somebody (28:36 - 28:40)
staffed because there's this weirdo that (28:38 - 28:42)
shows up after his three months I have (28:40 - 28:45)
the same weird sleep schedule I'm (28:42 - 28:48)
supporting their lifestyles (28:45 - 28:51)
laughs (28:48 - 28:51)
um the global challenge is also are you (28:52 - 28:57)
talking about the Nicollet Diner yes (28:54 - 28:59)
yeah it's pretty good (28:57 - 29:01)
yeah they're very lgbtq we like them (28:59 - 29:03)
yeah yeah they had uh they had a (29:01 - 29:07)
unicycle right next door and I was very (29:03 - 29:09)
confused because they had uh like half (29:07 - 29:12)
Barn Swinging Doors to get into the (29:09 - 29:13)
bathroom and I was like what is (29:12 - 29:16)
happening but once you get in it's like (29:13 - 29:20)
all like individual like yeah stalls (29:16 - 29:22)
um the The Swinging Doors really threw (29:20 - 29:24)
me off (29:22 - 29:29)
a little much they are in (29:24 - 29:32)
not necessarily a great part of town an (29:29 - 29:35)
open 24 hours so you get a lot of people (29:32 - 29:36)
who are coming in from the streets just (29:35 - 29:38)
to hide to get off the streets (29:36 - 29:40)
especially in winter so like they need (29:38 - 29:41)
those doors to sort of know did somebody (29:40 - 29:44)
somebody pass out on their way to the (29:41 - 29:46)
best oh that makes you need to go rescue (29:44 - 29:49)
them what's going doors always remind me (29:46 - 29:51)
of like back of house like oh you're (29:49 - 29:53)
going into like the kitchen or you're (29:51 - 29:56)
going like yeah where the managers are (29:53 - 29:58)
so that's why it was like yeah where are (29:56 - 30:00)
these Swinging Doors to the bathroom are (29:58 - 30:02)
you going in the right place right like (30:00 - 30:03)
am I allowed back here (30:02 - 30:07)
we used to have big gay gamer board game (30:03 - 30:10)
uh events in there's this so you've gone (30:07 - 30:11)
to the diner go to the back there's a (30:10 - 30:14)
big back room that I swear to God has no (30:11 - 30:15)
heat (30:14 - 30:17)
in it it never it was always an ice cold (30:15 - 30:19)
back there but they're like you can have (30:17 - 30:20)
this whole back room to play games as (30:19 - 30:23)
long as you're all buying something and (30:20 - 30:24)
their food is good and their milkshakes (30:23 - 30:26)
are great so it was never a hardship (30:24 - 30:29)
except it was so cold back it was like (30:26 - 30:31)
January it's like seven below outside it (30:29 - 30:34)
was like two inside and I'm like yeah I (30:31 - 30:36)
guess I'll have a milkshake why not (30:34 - 30:40)
let's just go For Broke (30:36 - 30:41)
um okay their fries are good Global (30:40 - 30:44)
Challenge three is also this weekend (30:41 - 30:46)
starts on the fifth well technically 7 (30:44 - 30:48)
P.M Central Time on the fourth because (30:46 - 30:51)
it's UTC you need to sign up before the (30:48 - 30:53)
tournament starts (30:51 - 30:56)
uh in order to get your Ultra Ball (30:53 - 30:58)
backpack we got a picture of a yellow (30:56 - 31:00)
backpack we've got a picture of what it (30:58 - 31:02)
looks like it is exactly what you (31:00 - 31:05)
imagined a circular yellow (31:02 - 31:09)
it doesn't look like an Ultra Ball it's (31:05 - 31:11)
just yellow oh I think the straps are a (31:09 - 31:14)
different color I'm sure they are but (31:11 - 31:16)
it's just a yellow Pokeball (31:14 - 31:20)
I mean this dare you Hannah criticize (31:16 - 31:22)
this beautiful backpack (31:20 - 31:24)
I'm not saying it looks bad I'm just (31:22 - 31:26)
saying it's not an Ultra Ball (31:24 - 31:30)
I mean it matches the great ball yeah (31:26 - 31:34)
but styling the great ball is more (31:30 - 31:39)
great no no instances is the great ball (31:34 - 31:42)
great okay so the great ball has red (31:39 - 31:44)
straps which makes sense because it (31:42 - 31:48)
matches the red whatever weird like red (31:44 - 31:50)
things they put on the Great Wall Racing (31:48 - 31:52)
Stripes that's what makes it great it (31:50 - 31:54)
moves faster the Ultra Ball I think has (31:52 - 31:57)
black straps black straps (31:54 - 32:00)
you switched though because the majority (31:57 - 32:01)
of the Ultra Ball is black and the (32:00 - 32:03)
majority of (32:01 - 32:05)
the great ball is blue oh that's true so (32:03 - 32:07)
yeah I see what you're saying I see what (32:05 - 32:08)
you're saying the primary color of the (32:07 - 32:10)
backpack would then be the majority (32:08 - 32:12)
color of the Pokeball but you can't have (32:10 - 32:14)
a Black Backpack if you're gonna do a (32:12 - 32:17)
luxury ball backpack because the luxury (32:14 - 32:20)
backpack is all black if if they if they (32:17 - 32:23)
did more Global challenges after this I (32:20 - 32:26)
would actually be surprised but we only (32:23 - 32:29)
got three in sword and shield we only (32:26 - 32:30)
got three ball games yeah we're still (32:29 - 32:32)
mad about (32:30 - 32:33)
unless they go to something else like (32:32 - 32:37)
the Pokeball socks the great ball sucks (32:33 - 32:41)
Ultra Ball socks because that's it you (32:37 - 32:42)
could change they should do more special (32:41 - 32:44)
tablecloths there's the one special (32:42 - 32:47)
tablecloth you can do by replaying one (32:44 - 32:51)
of the gym games oh yeah and that's fun (32:47 - 32:53)
I haven't done any I haven't done any of (32:51 - 32:54)
the like (32:53 - 32:57)
so you battle the gym leaders you get (32:54 - 33:00)
the credits and then to unlock six star (32:57 - 33:01)
raids you gotta battle the gym leaders (33:00 - 33:02)
again (33:01 - 33:05)
but you can do all of their challenges (33:02 - 33:09)
again and they all give you something I (33:05 - 33:12)
think the the psychic type gym leader (33:09 - 33:15)
gives you berries the Eevee reducing (33:12 - 33:17)
berries if you do the weird sideman said (33:15 - 33:20)
cash that puzzle so bad (33:17 - 33:22)
um it the Simon Says puzzle is more fun (33:20 - 33:25)
if you do it in real life while you're (33:22 - 33:28)
doing it (33:25 - 33:28)
I will say that (33:29 - 33:33)
um but the the olive roll challenge will (33:31 - 33:36)
give you an exclusive tablecloth uh I (33:33 - 33:38)
don't remember what grusha's (33:36 - 33:43)
bad race track thing gives you (33:38 - 33:45)
sad it's not great (33:43 - 33:46)
it's like the worst version of Mario (33:45 - 33:49)
Kart in the entire world (33:46 - 33:49)
it's not good (33:50 - 33:53)
um okay let's take a break and then when (33:51 - 33:56)
we come back we will talk about uh (33:53 - 33:59)
Pokemon go and uh all the events they've (33:56 - 34:00)
announced so far so we will be right (33:59 - 34:02)
back (34:00 - 34:05)
and we are back from our break (34:02 - 34:09)
and we are here to uh say that Pokemon (34:05 - 34:13)
go Fest takes over August 2023 with a (34:09 - 34:16)
month packed with events they're worth (34:13 - 34:16)
someone (34:16 - 34:21)
overlapping packs too FYI yeah Pokemon (34:16 - 34:25)
company and overlapping events Janine's (34:21 - 34:27)
really just like you know what all of (34:25 - 34:29)
you people who don't like us choke on (34:27 - 34:32)
this (34:29 - 34:32)
scheduling (34:32 - 34:36)
too bad (34:33 - 34:38)
gosh where do we even where do we even (34:36 - 34:40)
start with this they they finally (34:38 - 34:45)
announced uh Pokemon go Fest yep which (34:40 - 34:47)
I think the last time they announced it (34:45 - 34:49)
was the beginning of April so a little a (34:47 - 34:51)
little slow this time yeah but you know (34:49 - 34:52)
they had more months to go through (34:51 - 34:54)
because instead of doing it at the start (34:52 - 34:56)
of the summer they are doing it all at (34:54 - 34:58)
the end of summer that's yes it's true (34:56 - 35:01)
that's I I want to say that (34:58 - 35:04)
Seattle go Fest the U.S one was what (35:01 - 35:08)
like July 18th yeah it was July and then (35:04 - 35:11)
wasn't Germany was before it so Germany (35:08 - 35:12)
was yeah because Germany was Fourth of (35:11 - 35:14)
July weekend because I remember flying (35:12 - 35:17)
back from Germany being like (35:14 - 35:19)
either (35:17 - 35:20)
being like the airport is dead because (35:19 - 35:22)
why would anyone fly on the fourth of (35:20 - 35:24)
July like people are like they were like (35:22 - 35:26)
cooking hot dogs they're not on a plane (35:24 - 35:33)
yeah Berlin was July 1st that weekend (35:26 - 35:33)
yeah so I guess I guess timing wise (35:34 - 35:39)
that's fine I mean I'm sure Pokemon go (35:36 - 35:41)
fans are always mad you want you want to (35:39 - 35:42)
you want a group of people that are (35:41 - 35:44)
constantly mad Pokemon go fans are very (35:42 - 35:46)
mad so they I did see people were like (35:44 - 35:49)
where are they gonna announce it (35:46 - 35:51)
um but now that we know it's all in (35:49 - 35:53)
August so in August (35:51 - 35:55)
everything's in August not just Pokemon (35:53 - 35:57)
go yeah (35:55 - 36:01)
um okay so uh the first the first dates (35:57 - 36:03)
here are London and England August 4th (36:01 - 36:05)
5th and 6th (36:03 - 36:07)
uh (36:05 - 36:09)
uh London England (36:07 - 36:10)
I think I think they have the parks if I (36:09 - 36:12)
click learn more but also that same (36:10 - 36:15)
exact weekend August 4th 5th and 6th is (36:12 - 36:17)
Osaka Japan (36:15 - 36:21)
and then not on Pokemon Go's website but (36:17 - 36:23)
I will I will tell you here because it's (36:21 - 36:25)
on my calendar that the Pokemon world (36:23 - 36:29)
championships is the 10th 11th 12th and (36:25 - 36:31)
13th (36:29 - 36:35)
and then Pokemon go Fest New York City (36:31 - 36:39)
is the 18th 19th and 20th (36:35 - 36:41)
and then there will be the global (36:39 - 36:45)
Pokemon go Fest which is worldwide on (36:41 - 36:48)
August 26 and 27th so (36:45 - 36:50)
there was people being like don't get (36:48 - 36:52)
rid of the worldwide one Niantic was (36:50 - 36:54)
like we got you we love money as much as (36:52 - 36:57)
the next person you can give us 15 for (36:54 - 37:01)
that weekend if you want to do that uh (36:57 - 37:06)
so that's all that's all there and the (37:01 - 37:07)
community day will have to be the same (37:06 - 37:09)
weekend as worlds (37:07 - 37:12)
yeah oh gosh yeah yeah yeah yeah (37:09 - 37:14)
I didn't even think about that I think (37:12 - 37:16)
you're right (37:14 - 37:18)
because they're not going to do (37:16 - 37:20)
community day on any of the go Fest (37:18 - 37:23)
weekends unless right yeah real weird (37:20 - 37:25)
happens (37:23 - 37:27)
yeah I didn't even think about that okay (37:25 - 37:29)
so there there has to be like one person (37:27 - 37:31)
in the world that is going to do both (37:29 - 37:33)
Osaka and London right they're gonna (37:31 - 37:35)
like yeah they're gonna try (37:33 - 37:36)
I mean technically you go back in time (37:35 - 37:38)
when you leave Japan to go to London so (37:36 - 37:40)
right possible (37:38 - 37:43)
it's definitely possible (37:40 - 37:47)
I Good Luck Good Luck here's the thing I (37:43 - 37:50)
could I would I (37:47 - 37:50)
so want to buy a ticket for New York go (37:50 - 37:56)
Fest and if I had a job (37:53 - 37:59)
there would be very little keeping me (37:56 - 38:01)
from going to New York for that weekend (37:59 - 38:04)
but already I have to tell future (38:01 - 38:08)
employers FYI I have to go to Gen Con at (38:04 - 38:10)
the beginning of August and then I'm (38:08 - 38:15)
going to DragonCon at the end of August (38:10 - 38:15)
I don't know that I can weasel here's (38:15 - 38:20)
the thing here's the thing if I have (38:18 - 38:24)
not gotten a job by the time I'll get (38:20 - 38:28)
strolled around I may still do this then (38:24 - 38:30)
you then you might as well go you might (38:28 - 38:32)
as well go because I have no money and I (38:30 - 38:33)
might as well just blow it on something (38:32 - 38:35)
fun because I'll be super depressed by (38:33 - 38:38)
that point because (38:35 - 38:40)
uh my other secret thing is I'm trying (38:38 - 38:41)
to get a job (38:40 - 38:44)
there's a job for a company called (38:41 - 38:46)
SeatGeek in New York that I'm really (38:44 - 38:47)
trying to get a job there because I want (38:46 - 38:48)
to fly out to New York for a week for (38:47 - 38:50)
training and I really want to work for (38:48 - 38:53)
them so I'm trying to work this angle to (38:50 - 38:55)
like get a job with them and then work (38:53 - 38:57)
it at the same time that that go fast (38:55 - 38:59)
weekend would be so that I can write it (38:57 - 39:01)
off as a business expense like I got (38:59 - 39:04)
plans working in my head right now I (39:01 - 39:05)
want to go back to New York I really (39:04 - 39:08)
wanted to go to London (39:05 - 39:08)
in a much worse City (39:09 - 39:13)
I want I wanted to go to all three I was (39:14 - 39:18)
hoping that the European one would be in (39:16 - 39:22)
like Germany again and (39:18 - 39:24)
um I was like cool I feel more confident (39:22 - 39:26)
traveling solo to Germany I've done that (39:24 - 39:28)
before you know met people there it was (39:26 - 39:29)
really cool (39:28 - 39:32)
uh the overlapping thing is unfortunate (39:29 - 39:35)
I mean it was a really basic question to (39:32 - 39:37)
Niantic it was like Hey Niantic why are (39:35 - 39:38)
these events the same weekend and they (39:37 - 39:40)
were like Parks have limited (39:38 - 39:42)
availability we did the best we could (39:40 - 39:44)
and was like that's some very like yep I (39:42 - 39:46)
get it (39:44 - 39:48)
like you if you're like hey I want to (39:46 - 39:50)
play an event they're like this is the (39:48 - 39:51)
only weekend we have in August they're (39:50 - 39:53)
like I guess that's the weekend we're (39:51 - 39:55)
taking (39:53 - 39:57)
I think that these Parks have better (39:55 - 39:59)
access via public transit too oh yeah (39:57 - 40:02)
yeah (39:59 - 40:02)
I I don't know anything about the Osaka (40:03 - 40:08)
Japan one but uh I've everywhere I read (40:06 - 40:10)
it was in a really great place (40:08 - 40:11)
um and there's multiple ways to get to (40:10 - 40:13)
that one I'm not sure about the London (40:11 - 40:15)
one either Randall Island which I (40:13 - 40:17)
believe is the where the New York one is (40:15 - 40:19)
I don't (40:17 - 40:22)
know they have a bus every 15 minutes (40:19 - 40:25)
they have a bus but I think the problem (40:22 - 40:26)
with Randall's Island is because it is (40:25 - 40:28)
an island you cross this bridge to get (40:26 - 40:30)
over to it and then once you're on that (40:28 - 40:32)
island there's like nothing there so (40:30 - 40:34)
from what I read is like if you want (40:32 - 40:36)
food you have to like leave the island (40:34 - 40:38)
oh interesting it's the true New York (40:36 - 40:40)
experience look (40:38 - 40:43)
I know people so my friend who lived in (40:40 - 40:45)
New York lived on I think she lived on (40:43 - 40:47)
Staten Island for a while and she would (40:45 - 40:50)
literally pack (40:47 - 40:52)
an entire day's worth of food two (40:50 - 40:55)
changes of clothing because she's like (40:52 - 40:59)
once I'm over to my job in on Long in in (40:55 - 41:03)
Manhattan getting back home is a (40:59 - 41:05)
three-hour experience she's like I just (41:03 - 41:06)
had to pack everything that I had (41:05 - 41:09)
planned to do for that entire day to go (41:06 - 41:12)
into the city find places to change and (41:09 - 41:14)
you wouldn't go back home (41:12 - 41:17)
until late that night like New York's (41:14 - 41:22)
public transit is good but it just takes (41:17 - 41:26)
a lot of time (41:22 - 41:26)
where it in relationship where is (41:28 - 41:34)
Randall's Park like in relation to (41:30 - 41:34)
uh (41:34 - 41:37)
[Music] (41:35 - 41:40)
East East (41:37 - 41:40)
um (41:41 - 41:45)
yeah it's east of Central Park (41:41 - 41:48)
in the middle like true go Fest fashion (41:45 - 41:51)
booking a ticket is incredibly confusing (41:48 - 41:53)
and if you are not (41:51 - 41:55)
constantly talking about to the people (41:53 - 41:58)
you are booking if you're not constantly (41:55 - 42:00)
talking to the people you want to play (41:58 - 42:01)
with (42:00 - 42:03)
it is possible where you flip the (42:01 - 42:05)
experiences and all of a sudden you (42:03 - 42:09)
can't play with them because it is the (42:05 - 42:11)
I don't I don't think there's anything (42:09 - 42:13)
wrong with the half of the day in the (42:11 - 42:15)
park half the day in the city I think (42:13 - 42:17)
that is fantastic it worked really well (42:15 - 42:20)
in Seattle it was great (42:17 - 42:22)
um I'm glad they're bringing it back (42:20 - 42:26)
it's it's just you literally have to (42:22 - 42:29)
talk to your group of people and all be (42:26 - 42:32)
on the same page in order to do this (42:29 - 42:35)
because if if one person books morning (42:32 - 42:38)
in the park and everyone else books (42:35 - 42:41)
morning in the city that one person now (42:38 - 42:44)
is excluded from your play group (42:41 - 42:44)
um (42:44 - 42:46)
so I will go through the New York one (42:44 - 42:49)
because I'm assuming that that's the (42:46 - 42:50)
majority of our audience is listening to (42:49 - 42:52)
that there's an early bird discounted (42:50 - 42:55)
price available now that being said if (42:52 - 42:57)
early bird sells out which it already (42:55 - 42:59)
did in Osaka it doesn't mean the event (42:57 - 43:00)
is sold out it just means you have to (42:59 - 43:03)
wait until the second round of tickets (43:00 - 43:04)
come (43:03 - 43:05)
um this was just like if you bought it (43:04 - 43:07)
now you got like what like a five dollar (43:05 - 43:10)
discount yeah (43:07 - 43:11)
don't worry they'll make up the five (43:10 - 43:14)
dollars when we get to the end (43:11 - 43:17)
uh Pokemon go Fest is coming to New York (43:14 - 43:19)
City we're planning a big event for the (43:17 - 43:22)
Big Apple uh it will split into two (43:19 - 43:24)
different experiences Randall's Park and (43:22 - 43:26)
then throughout New York City uh (43:24 - 43:29)
attendees will enjoy exclusive gameplay (43:26 - 43:32)
special bonuses and a more as they (43:29 - 43:33)
Adventure alongside thousands of other (43:32 - 43:35)
trainers and spend half their day in (43:33 - 43:37)
Randall Island Park and the other (43:35 - 43:40)
exploring the larger New York City area (43:37 - 43:43)
ticket purchases include both Randall's (43:40 - 43:45)
Park and the New York City experience (43:43 - 43:47)
the only difference is the time of day (43:45 - 43:49)
at each location (43:47 - 43:51)
early bird tickets are available now (43:49 - 43:54)
until June 15th these are discounted for (43:51 - 43:55)
limited so snag them early to take (43:54 - 43:57)
advantage of the cheaper price (43:55 - 44:00)
so they are normally thirty dollars (43:57 - 44:02)
so until June or I guess until they sell (44:00 - 44:05)
out they're 25. (44:02 - 44:06)
um (44:05 - 44:08)
the park experience or the I guess the (44:06 - 44:11)
the whole experience starts at nine (44:08 - 44:15)
a.m it's saying that it ends at 7 00 pm (44:11 - 44:17)
so that's (44:15 - 44:20)
that I think that is just one hour like (44:17 - 44:22)
was Seattle not ten to six (44:20 - 44:25)
I swear Seattle was ten to six (44:22 - 44:28)
so this is this is a this is a 10 hour (44:25 - 44:29)
day (44:28 - 44:31)
and I'm almost positive Seattle was an (44:29 - 44:34)
eight-hour day (44:31 - 44:34)
uh there are special add-ons (44:35 - 44:42)
so you can do the raid lover add-on (44:39 - 44:47)
which is 15 that will give you 18 raid (44:42 - 44:49)
passes a day not remote raid passes The (44:47 - 44:51)
in-person Raid passes (44:49 - 44:55)
uh you will get so oh so to be again (44:51 - 44:57)
this is not clear even though it says 18 (44:55 - 45:00)
passes per day (44:57 - 45:04)
you you will get 18 passes Friday (45:00 - 45:09)
Saturday and Sunday for 15 so that is a (45:04 - 45:12)
great deal if you like rating if you (45:09 - 45:14)
plan to explore the city and jump into (45:12 - 45:16)
raids which you should have no problem (45:14 - 45:19)
doing since you will be in New York City (45:16 - 45:22)
if you live in the middle of nowhere and (45:19 - 45:23)
you're listening to this podcast and (45:22 - 45:25)
you're like man no one in my city raids (45:23 - 45:27)
let me introduce you (45:25 - 45:30)
to one of the biggest cities in the (45:27 - 45:32)
United States where there will be raids (45:30 - 45:34)
everywhere and there will be thousands (45:32 - 45:36)
of Pokemon fans that I'm selling this (45:34 - 45:38)
better than Niantic and I get no money (45:36 - 45:41)
and I also hate giving Niantic money but (45:38 - 45:45)
you will get 18 what is 18 times three I (45:41 - 45:48)
don't know 40 something 56. (45:45 - 45:52)
54. math I think it's 54. (45:48 - 45:55)
that's a lot of raids anyways so if you (45:52 - 45:58)
plan on if you plan on rating (45:55 - 46:00)
I think this is worth getting (45:58 - 46:03)
you will also get 5 000 additional XP (46:00 - 46:06)
you will get six additional candy for (46:03 - 46:09)
five star and mega raids you will get (46:06 - 46:11)
three additional XL candy for five star (46:09 - 46:14)
and mega raids and then your bonuses (46:11 - 46:16)
will be active through Friday through (46:14 - 46:17)
Sunday so (46:16 - 46:20)
pretty good deal now the opposite of a (46:17 - 46:22)
good deal if you would like to get (46:20 - 46:23)
scammed out of your money let me (46:22 - 46:25)
introduce you to the AG Enthusiast which (46:23 - 46:27)
is fifteen dollars as well (46:25 - 46:30)
that will give you one fourth egg hatch (46:27 - 46:32)
distance you will get an increased (46:30 - 46:34)
chance of 10K eggs you will get three (46:32 - 46:36)
times the hatch Stardust three times the (46:34 - 46:39)
hatch XP three times the hatch candy and (46:36 - 46:40)
it will be active all weekend Friday (46:39 - 46:42)
through Sunday (46:40 - 46:45)
what that does not include (46:42 - 46:48)
is incubators any at all (46:45 - 46:52)
incubator yeah (46:48 - 46:52)
keep paying for that (46:55 - 47:01)
correct do we think they like (46:57 - 47:05)
forgot no they don't know (47:01 - 47:08)
they did this for Vegas they did this (47:05 - 47:09)
for Seattle (47:08 - 47:12)
they did this for Berlin I think yeah (47:09 - 47:15)
incubators are too rare they're too (47:12 - 47:19)
valuable compared to raid passes despite (47:15 - 47:21)
all the discourse (47:19 - 47:24)
yeah it would be nice if they gave you (47:21 - 47:26)
like a handful of incubators I think (47:24 - 47:27)
that would make us a better deal even (47:26 - 47:30)
just five incubators if you if you spend (47:27 - 47:32)
fifteen dollars and then you didn't know (47:30 - 47:34)
you needed to buy incubators you're (47:32 - 47:37)
relying on your one free incubator and I (47:34 - 47:39)
don't to be fair one quarter hatch (47:37 - 47:42)
distance does speed that up a bunch (47:39 - 47:45)
but yeah but you're just one but you're (47:42 - 47:48)
getting more 10K eggs yeah I'm looking (47:45 - 47:50)
at the Seattle go Fest page from last (47:48 - 47:53)
year and it was it started at nine nine (47:50 - 47:56)
a.m to 1 30 p.m isn't that the same (47:53 - 47:57)
oh did it start at night that's what it (47:56 - 48:00)
says I don't remember editing it at (47:57 - 48:02)
seven seven seemed late but (48:00 - 48:05)
maybe it is the same time yeah (48:02 - 48:07)
um oh you know I think Seattle's go Fest (48:05 - 48:09)
was nine hours I think it did end at six (48:07 - 48:12)
but they forced everyone to take an hour (48:09 - 48:14)
break (48:12 - 48:14)
they turned off all which I I think was (48:15 - 48:19)
really healthy honestly (48:18 - 48:22)
because again you know play play at your (48:19 - 48:24)
own style if you want to grind super (48:22 - 48:26)
hard that's fine but at a certain point (48:24 - 48:28)
Niantic should be like (48:26 - 48:31)
um eat something please please stop (48:28 - 48:33)
catching snorlaxes and please just take (48:31 - 48:36)
10 minutes and go to Subway (48:33 - 48:39)
I promise you you will feel better for (48:36 - 48:41)
the remainder of the day if you just (48:39 - 48:45)
stop grinding for one second (48:41 - 48:45)
city-wide gameplay this is new uh for (48:45 - 48:51)
twenty dollars extend the go Fest fun (48:49 - 48:53)
and enjoy the city experience throughout (48:51 - 48:56)
New York City uh on the extra day or (48:53 - 48:59)
days of your choice this add-on provides (48:56 - 49:01)
an extra day of the same city-wide (48:59 - 49:03)
gameplay experience that is available on (49:01 - 49:05)
your primary day however there is no (49:03 - 49:07)
additional special or timed research (49:05 - 49:09)
this add-on enables additional Citywide (49:07 - 49:11)
gameplay the Randalls Park event will (49:09 - 49:15)
only be for your primary event day on (49:11 - 49:17)
your ticket (49:15 - 49:18)
and then (49:17 - 49:21)
and then the last add-on is a t-shirt (49:18 - 49:25)
pre-order pre-order your in person of (49:21 - 49:28)
invent exclusive Pokemon go Fest t-shirt (49:25 - 49:30)
now pick it up during the event each (49:28 - 49:32)
t-shirt purchased will also come with a (49:30 - 49:35)
code that can be redeemed for a matching (49:32 - 49:39)
in app Avatar item t-shirts are limited (49:35 - 49:41)
and pre-orders will only be while (49:39 - 49:43)
supplies last no returns no exchanges (49:41 - 49:45)
Etc the same T-shirt design in a (49:43 - 49:47)
different color will be available for (49:45 - 49:50)
sale uh on the 906 website they've done (49:47 - 49:53)
this before by the way like the you (49:50 - 49:54)
could get the T-shirt off the website it (49:53 - 49:56)
was a different color the ones at go (49:54 - 49:58)
Fest were a different color (49:56 - 50:00)
um this I I like this I like like the (49:58 - 50:04)
pre-order get a t-shirt in game pick it (50:00 - 50:06)
up one when you're there they know (50:04 - 50:08)
exactly how many at least they should (50:06 - 50:11)
pre-order because t-shirts are very high (50:08 - 50:13)
if you haven't been to a event that (50:11 - 50:15)
people love t-shirts they just do it's (50:13 - 50:16)
like the whole like I've been to a (50:15 - 50:18)
concert I want the T-shirt kind of thing (50:16 - 50:20)
I do like this I do like the pre-order (50:18 - 50:21)
and everything (50:20 - 50:24)
I don't love how we have no clue what (50:21 - 50:27)
the t-shirt is exactly yep (50:24 - 50:29)
that that makes my decision on whether I (50:27 - 50:31)
want the T-shirt or not I'm not gonna (50:29 - 50:34)
wear it if I don't like how it looks (50:31 - 50:37)
uh (50:34 - 50:37)
uh and not all of the go Fest t-shirts (50:39 - 50:44)
have been good just to say that (50:41 - 50:47)
like yeah (50:44 - 50:47)
so you you can add on (50:48 - 50:53)
um I'm a little unclear you can add on (50:51 - 50:57)
to City experiences correct (50:53 - 51:00)
because each one is just the twenty (50:57 - 51:05)
dollars is just for one day (51:00 - 51:05)
so if I wanted to go Friday to London (51:07 - 51:13)
I'll just say 9 A.M in the park my (51:10 - 51:17)
mobile provider is the Vodafone (51:13 - 51:19)
uh (51:17 - 51:21)
that is mine that is my name (51:19 - 51:23)
because it says extra day or days of (51:21 - 51:26)
your choice (51:23 - 51:26)
I don't know (51:28 - 51:33)
so if I add the T-shirt (51:30 - 51:35)
oh and then the oh it does ask you the (51:33 - 51:36)
size of the T-shirt oh and you can add (51:35 - 51:38)
up to four t-shirts that's kind of crazy (51:36 - 51:40)
wild (51:38 - 51:40)
um (51:40 - 51:43)
no okay so you do add each day so I (51:40 - 51:45)
picked I wanted to play on Friday in (51:43 - 51:47)
London and then it says do you want to (51:45 - 51:49)
add city-wide gameplay for Saturday (51:47 - 51:52)
that's 22 pounds which is 20 USD and (51:49 - 51:53)
then it says do you want to add Citywide (51:52 - 51:56)
gameplay for Sunday that's also 22 (51:53 - 51:57)
pounds and then there's the raid lover (51:56 - 52:00)
and then there's the egg enthusiasts so (51:57 - 52:03)
I should have done this in American I I (52:00 - 52:04)
picked London because it was the first (52:03 - 52:06)
option so if I want everything if I want (52:04 - 52:10)
uh one ticket for myself for Friday in (52:06 - 52:12)
London but I also want that I want the (52:10 - 52:14)
T-shirt I want city-wide for Saturday I (52:12 - 52:15)
want Citywide for Sunday I want raid (52:14 - 52:18)
lover I want egg enthusiasts I am paying (52:15 - 52:22)
131 pounds I'm pretty sure in the US (52:18 - 52:24)
it'll be 127 with all of the options (52:22 - 52:25)
there (52:24 - 52:28)
yeah and that is not including your (52:25 - 52:29)
incubator (52:28 - 52:33)
or any of your flights or hotels (52:29 - 52:33)
the great thing about (52:39 - 52:46)
Japan and even Germany and uh to be fair (52:42 - 52:49)
I went to Japan four years ago to I went (52:46 - 52:51)
to Germany one year ago but in my (52:49 - 52:54)
experience booking travel (52:51 - 52:57)
their hotels were significantly cheaper (52:54 - 53:00)
than an American Hotel (52:57 - 53:04)
now we're talking an American Hotel in (53:00 - 53:07)
New York City (53:04 - 53:07)
yeah (53:07 - 53:11)
not that Seattle's any cheaper Seattle's (53:09 - 53:12)
also a pretty expensive city and (53:11 - 53:16)
channels expensive New York is (53:12 - 53:18)
the thing about the thing about New York (53:16 - 53:22)
is once you're in Manhattan you you can (53:18 - 53:23)
pretty much walk everywhere (53:22 - 53:26)
it's it's not a huge place (53:23 - 53:28)
so once you're like in your room and (53:26 - 53:31)
settled in like that is because New York (53:28 - 53:33)
isn't cheap for you anything food's (53:31 - 53:36)
going to be expensive although you can (53:33 - 53:37)
do a lot of Street Fender stuff which is (53:36 - 53:41)
you know get a hot dog at your own risk (53:37 - 53:43)
yeah and like Vegas Vegas is like that (53:41 - 53:45)
weird exception because like they want (53:43 - 53:48)
Vegas to be like a little bit cheaper (53:45 - 53:51)
because they want you to gamble (53:48 - 53:51)
like rope you in with like a slightly (53:52 - 53:57)
cheaper flight a slight a slightly (53:55 - 53:59)
cheaper hotel and then like they get you (53:57 - 54:01)
with food and gambling and like you want (53:59 - 54:04)
to do like any show like shows are super (54:01 - 54:08)
expensive they just (54:04 - 54:08)
that's my problem if I went to New York (54:08 - 54:14)
for this I would so want to see a show (54:11 - 54:16)
there are so many good shows on Broadway (54:14 - 54:17)
right now (54:16 - 54:19)
so as this was recording I'd (54:17 - 54:21)
outrageously expensive trip for me (54:19 - 54:23)
uh Sunday afternoon here as we're (54:21 - 54:24)
recording this the only one that has (54:23 - 54:27)
sold out right now is Osaka Japan not (54:24 - 54:31)
super surprising but Japan loves Pokemon (54:27 - 54:31)
um that doesn't mean that all of Japan (54:32 - 54:35)
is like sold out like I said only the (54:33 - 54:38)
early bird stuff is sold out (54:35 - 54:39)
um (54:38 - 54:42)
it is unfortunate that Japan and London (54:39 - 54:46)
are the the same weekend although I I'm (54:42 - 54:48)
sure (54:46 - 54:48)
Niantic didn't want that (54:48 - 54:54)
because that would require all hands on (54:51 - 54:56)
deck for like (54:54 - 54:59)
multi like one event is over okay well (54:56 - 55:01)
we still need the next event well like (54:59 - 55:04)
they are technically not I don't think (55:01 - 55:06)
they overlap that much because of time (55:04 - 55:09)
zones (55:06 - 55:09)
yeah that's like a very long weekend (55:09 - 55:15)
um and then after that is Worlds and (55:13 - 55:17)
then after that is New York and then (55:15 - 55:20)
after that is the worldwide (55:17 - 55:22)
um which we didn't even talk about the (55:20 - 55:27)
the worldwide one is fifteen dollars (55:22 - 55:27)
uh it's Saturday and Sunday 10 to 6. (55:27 - 55:36)
no add-ons not just just 15 bucks (55:31 - 55:39)
um it was 15 last year right because (55:36 - 55:40)
people complained that the year before (55:39 - 55:42)
that it was (55:40 - 55:44)
five dollars but that was because like (55:42 - 55:45)
Google (55:44 - 55:47)
yeah podcast or Google play like (55:45 - 55:49)
sponsored it or something yeah which is (55:47 - 55:52)
like kind of weird to me that they (55:49 - 55:55)
are they struggling to get sponsors here (55:52 - 55:57)
like how did they get Google to sponsor (55:55 - 56:00)
that one year (55:57 - 56:03)
and they haven't had a sponsor since (56:00 - 56:06)
I mean I thought they were selling our (56:03 - 56:08)
data (56:06 - 56:08)
so so sponsors so we don't have to pay (56:09 - 56:15)
15 bucks (56:12 - 56:15)
I I don't know (56:16 - 56:20)
um (56:18 - 56:23)
I I we we don't know what Pokemon are (56:20 - 56:24)
featured (56:23 - 56:25)
um (56:24 - 56:27)
we don't know what the research looks (56:25 - 56:30)
like we don't know you know is London (56:27 - 56:31)
having (56:30 - 56:34)
a certain Pokemon spawn is Osaka having (56:31 - 56:36)
certain Pokemon spawn there's supposed (56:34 - 56:37)
to be some treasure map thing that (56:36 - 56:41)
they're like hinting at and then (56:37 - 56:42)
you can kind of see in the background of (56:41 - 56:44)
the logo that there's like binoculars in (56:42 - 56:45)
a treasure map with an X (56:44 - 56:49)
and then on the logo itself (56:45 - 56:51)
they're like one step away from using (56:49 - 56:54)
papyrus (56:51 - 56:54)
but they have like the little treasure (56:54 - 56:59)
tracking lines and then they have like (56:57 - 57:03)
two little diamonds which seem like (56:59 - 57:07)
Diane say dance Mega Sableye (57:03 - 57:08)
yes (57:07 - 57:11)
[Laughter] (57:08 - 57:13)
it's actually just Carbink you do the (57:11 - 57:17)
whole area welcome (57:13 - 57:20)
shiny carbank pink (57:17 - 57:21)
um (57:20 - 57:23)
yeah it's like black and blue right yeah (57:21 - 57:25)
these diamonds are pink this is Dancing (57:23 - 57:28)
Yeah Yeah Yeah (57:25 - 57:28)
like Niantic though we'll get a car bank (57:30 - 57:34)
at the end and we're like ah we thought (57:33 - 57:38)
that was the oh yeah that was a rare one (57:34 - 57:38)
oh in the in (57:40 - 57:47)
on diancie's chest is the pink diamond I (57:42 - 57:49)
think I don't think this is surprising I (57:47 - 57:51)
think we've always known this I I guess (57:49 - 57:53)
I just want to reiterate this point (57:51 - 57:55)
it doesn't matter (57:53 - 57:58)
what is at the event (57:55 - 58:00)
it's just the event (57:58 - 58:03)
they literally showed nothing (58:00 - 58:08)
and like people are Osaka sold out yeah (58:03 - 58:09)
yeah (58:08 - 58:12)
it looks like (58:09 - 58:14)
we know what we can pay for (58:12 - 58:16)
kind of I mean we don't know what the (58:14 - 58:18)
event looks like at all not any of the (58:16 - 58:20)
specialized ones not any of not the (58:18 - 58:22)
worldwide one (58:20 - 58:24)
we know what the add-ons are (58:22 - 58:27)
that's about it I don't expect the (58:24 - 58:30)
worldwide one to be as good as any of (58:27 - 58:32)
them yeah for sure I don't think it (58:30 - 58:34)
needs to be as good though because if it (58:32 - 58:37)
if it is as good it takes away from the (58:34 - 58:39)
in-person one right but you want people (58:37 - 58:42)
to be able to continue to enjoy this big (58:39 - 58:44)
yearly event when not everybody can (58:42 - 58:46)
afford to get (58:44 - 58:49)
to the in-person ones I'm not sure I'm (58:46 - 58:50)
gonna be able to afford to get to an (58:49 - 58:52)
in-person one this year I really want to (58:50 - 58:55)
I've never been to one before (58:52 - 58:57)
but not everybody can afford that yeah (58:55 - 59:00)
no I it's it's the whole Concert (58:57 - 59:02)
Experience you want to see Nine Inch (59:00 - 59:05)
Nails you Pony up the money no I guess (59:02 - 59:07)
the difference is like they they go to (59:05 - 59:09)
multiple cities they come to you in a (59:07 - 59:12)
lot of places like if I am not traveling (59:09 - 59:13)
to New York to see Nine Inch Nails (59:12 - 59:16)
unless it's like we're doing a 17-hour (59:13 - 59:17)
show we're playing everything that you (59:16 - 59:20)
like like that is not a thing and also (59:17 - 59:22)
you get to capture one (59:20 - 59:24)
of them person take them home I think (59:22 - 59:26)
it's like Nine Inch Nails song I know (59:24 - 59:30)
it's from like Guitar Hero (59:26 - 59:30)
um (59:30 - 59:34)
yeah I mean (59:31 - 59:37)
I I just I just don't have a lot of (59:34 - 59:40)
faith in the 15 Global thing (59:37 - 59:42)
um it's gonna be there (59:40 - 59:45)
I'm sure it will be fine and I'm sure (59:42 - 59:47)
you will get your 15 worth but I don't (59:45 - 59:51)
think 15 to get Community Day shiny odds (59:47 - 59:55)
is I don't even think 15 to get like (59:51 - 59:58)
go Fest shiny odds (59:55 - 60:01)
um like and go fest's shiny odds are not (59:58 - 60:02)
as good as community so again to anyone (60:01 - 60:05)
who's not been to an in-person go Fest (60:02 - 60:08)
like we we don't know like Niantic will (60:05 - 60:11)
never release shiny odds (60:08 - 60:13)
um we just know that it's about 1 in 25 (60:11 - 60:15)
because we've done so many Community (60:13 - 60:17)
Days and we've gathered so many data (60:15 - 60:20)
from the community that we can pinpoint (60:17 - 60:24)
that it's about 1 in 25. yeah um and I (60:20 - 60:26)
want to say that past go Fest have been (60:24 - 60:28)
like I want to say it's like 1 in 80. (60:26 - 60:29)
somebody might correct me in like the (60:28 - 60:30)
YouTube comments or something but I want (60:29 - 60:32)
to say like past go Fest were like about (60:30 - 60:33)
180-ish (60:32 - 60:37)
for shiny odds which is so really good (60:33 - 60:39)
um yeah you still will get probably at (60:37 - 60:42)
least one shiny (60:39 - 60:43)
um yeah (60:42 - 60:46)
um but also like (60:43 - 60:49)
we we have known from other events that (60:46 - 60:52)
they boost certain Pokemon (60:49 - 60:54)
uh like then they've been doing that (60:52 - 60:57)
more and more yeah so like Vegas I don't (60:54 - 60:58)
think (60:57 - 61:00)
it seemed like in Vegas I don't actually (60:58 - 61:02)
know I don't know if there was any (61:00 - 61:03)
people that did research it seemed like (61:02 - 61:06)
Castform was not boosted like when you (61:03 - 61:07)
looked at people's shinies it was like (61:06 - 61:09)
oh cool you got like shiny Trico and (61:07 - 61:11)
shiny Nincada and shiny cacturn but it (61:09 - 61:13)
felt like no one really was really (61:11 - 61:16)
getting like shiny cast form (61:13 - 61:18)
um (61:16 - 61:20)
but also like unknown is always sought (61:18 - 61:22)
after two to be shiny and it never feels (61:20 - 61:24)
like unknown is boosted or if they are (61:22 - 61:25)
boosted they're boosted like differently (61:24 - 61:27)
like right this Pokemon might be 180 but (61:25 - 61:30)
unknown is like one in 200. like again (61:27 - 61:33)
it's so hard to pinpoint because (61:30 - 61:35)
you need so many people reporting and (61:33 - 61:38)
Niantic is never going to say they don't (61:35 - 61:40)
have to well and they probably the (61:38 - 61:41)
Pokemon company doesn't want them to (61:40 - 61:42)
either because (61:41 - 61:44)
oh undoubtedly (61:42 - 61:45)
um (61:44 - 61:48)
also one one other point on the global (61:45 - 61:50)
go Fest is just that (61:48 - 61:52)
like in previous years this is an event (61:50 - 61:54)
that is going to be available to (61:52 - 61:55)
everyone whether you pay for it or not (61:54 - 61:57)
you're just going to get more things if (61:55 - 62:00)
you do pay for it last year whether it (61:57 - 62:02)
was actually worth paying for it was (62:00 - 62:03)
debatable (62:02 - 62:06)
I think (62:03 - 62:06)
is that the one we went to the zoo for (62:06 - 62:10)
Greg (62:08 - 62:11)
yeah (62:10 - 62:14)
yeah it was two days we did the first (62:11 - 62:16)
day in the art park because I was (62:14 - 62:17)
streaming and then we did the second day (62:16 - 62:20)
at the zoo at the zoo which is also (62:17 - 62:21)
streaming and that girl gave you the (62:20 - 62:23)
stink eye oh yeah she did (62:21 - 62:25)
um (62:23 - 62:27)
I remember having a great time those two (62:25 - 62:29)
days I enjoyed it (62:27 - 62:30)
um I don't think it was as fun as an (62:29 - 62:32)
in-person one would have been but I (62:30 - 62:33)
definitely got together with the (62:32 - 62:36)
community I had at the time I played the (62:33 - 62:38)
game both days and I even gifted a pass (62:36 - 62:40)
to a friend because I thought I mean I (62:38 - 62:43)
guess it was worth it to a certain (62:40 - 62:46)
extent yeah I mean again the experience (62:43 - 62:48)
is if you can get it's it's a set event (62:46 - 62:49)
that you can get your friends to all do (62:48 - 62:51)
a thing with it that's the best thing (62:49 - 62:54)
for a lot of people about this game that (62:51 - 62:55)
that is the only good thing about this (62:54 - 62:56)
game (62:55 - 62:58)
uh uh I mean when I was talking to will (62:56 - 62:59)
will was like (62:58 - 63:01)
I think I'm gonna go to go fast and I (62:59 - 63:02)
was like I thought you hate this game (63:01 - 63:03)
and he was like yeah but I want to see (63:02 - 63:05)
people and I was like yeah that's this (63:03 - 63:07)
game in a nutshell yeah yeah (63:05 - 63:10)
oh maybe we'll can pay for my trip to (63:07 - 63:11)
New York (63:10 - 63:13)
yeah he just bought it yeah if I don't (63:11 - 63:17)
have a job I'm gonna figure this out (63:13 - 63:17)
um (63:18 - 63:23)
well they they announced it so uh I I (63:20 - 63:27)
don't love that it's like all in August (63:23 - 63:28)
I (63:27 - 63:30)
we know the dates now August is (63:28 - 63:32)
completely packed yeah August is (63:30 - 63:35)
completely packed I I do kind of wish it (63:32 - 63:38)
was more spread out I think we looked at (63:35 - 63:40)
go fests I think we looked at last (63:38 - 63:42)
year's go Fest and it was at least two (63:40 - 63:45)
weeks at least two weeks minimum between (63:42 - 63:47)
every event so the fact that it's like (63:45 - 63:50)
to go fast worlds another go Fest and (63:47 - 63:53)
then worldwide go Fest (63:50 - 63:53)
all the other things that happened in (63:55 - 63:59)
that that's the end of the August is (63:57 - 64:03)
State Fair time it's a lot it's just a (63:59 - 64:06)
lot yeah worldwide go Fest was a ways (64:03 - 64:09)
before worlds last year yeah and I think (64:06 - 64:12)
in past Japan has always gone last for (64:09 - 64:15)
go Fest and us has always gone first so (64:12 - 64:17)
this is this is a flip (64:15 - 64:20)
but maybe it'll go off smoothly or maybe (64:17 - 64:23)
we'll finally get the the worst uh bugs (64:20 - 64:25)
of the event this time look if you're a (64:23 - 64:27)
true Pokemon go player you always want (64:25 - 64:30)
to do the first go Fest and the first (64:27 - 64:34)
day because you know that it will break (64:30 - 64:36)
and Niantic will have to compensate you (64:34 - 64:39)
in some way yeah (64:36 - 64:41)
maybe (64:39 - 64:44)
you gotta roll the dice (64:41 - 64:44)
uh for Vegas the compensation was you (64:45 - 64:51)
could play the rest of the night in the (64:49 - 64:52)
city (64:51 - 64:55)
and that was until (64:52 - 64:58)
the event ended at (64:55 - 65:00)
six and I think they extended the city (64:58 - 65:02)
till 10 pm (65:00 - 65:05)
so they gave you four hours of (65:02 - 65:08)
that experience and then I think (65:05 - 65:12)
they gave everyone the the egg (65:08 - 65:16)
enthusiasts who bought it yeah they gave (65:12 - 65:19)
everyone that over the worldwide Vegas (65:16 - 65:22)
weekend but only if you bought it (65:19 - 65:25)
which was a huge bonus honestly it was (65:22 - 65:27)
it was actually like the legit good (65:25 - 65:28)
bonus (65:27 - 65:29)
um (65:28 - 65:32)
uh to continue on (65:29 - 65:34)
okay uh two more bits of news here uh we (65:32 - 65:37)
got clever making its Pokemon go debut (65:34 - 65:40)
during a Cleaver raid day (65:37 - 65:42)
uh Cleaver originally discovered in the (65:40 - 65:45)
Hisui region featured in Pokemon Legends (65:42 - 65:47)
Arceus is coming to Pokemon go on (65:45 - 65:51)
Saturday May 6. so you know you know (65:47 - 65:53)
after you're done uh doing some (65:51 - 65:55)
intellion you squeezing in some walking (65:53 - 65:57)
wake iron leaves do a little bit of (65:55 - 65:59)
global Challenge number three you you (65:57 - 66:02)
top it off with a little Cleaver you (65:59 - 66:06)
know Pokemon just wants your entire life (66:02 - 66:09)
how dare you play any other franchise (66:06 - 66:12)
just I mean some of those you can spread (66:09 - 66:16)
out I am not doing this unless I'm doing (66:12 - 66:18)
it in between panels I'm gonna probably (66:16 - 66:22)
do a one and done go to one in person I (66:18 - 66:24)
don't like how they (66:22 - 66:27)
are making this raid day uh they're (66:24 - 66:28)
they're boosting the numbers of remote (66:27 - 66:30)
raids you can do just for the raid day (66:28 - 66:36)
which is Hannah yep I yep nope uh not (66:30 - 66:38)
gonna pay for that myself don't like how (66:36 - 66:41)
that's becoming what it is (66:38 - 66:42)
um they're advertising that you can get (66:41 - 66:45)
Cleaver shiny which is fine new Pokemon (66:42 - 66:48)
Shiny available all great but you can't (66:45 - 66:50)
evolve your Scyther nope you just can't (66:48 - 66:53)
nope so if you've been saving up a good (66:50 - 66:55)
Scyther or a shiny Scyther waiting for a (66:53 - 66:56)
day where you could evolve Scyther into (66:55 - 66:59)
Cleaver you're still stuck waiting for (66:56 - 67:02)
maybe a Community Day someday (66:59 - 67:05)
I mean the shiny for Cleaver is bad it's (67:02 - 67:06)
green (67:05 - 67:09)
it's a better green it's we're done with (67:06 - 67:11)
green we need to move past green yeah (67:09 - 67:13)
but if you wanted a good cleaver (67:11 - 67:15)
you will have higher odds with raids (67:13 - 67:17)
than by catching them in the wild but (67:15 - 67:19)
still if you had a hundred percent (67:17 - 67:21)
Scyther that you were saving to evolve (67:19 - 67:23)
into a Cleaver or whatever its best PVP (67:21 - 67:26)
IVs would be I mean we're just gonna get (67:23 - 67:28)
what a hasuian stone (67:26 - 67:31)
at some point gosh I hope so that would (67:28 - 67:34)
be really helpful I wish they would take (67:31 - 67:36)
the seven million items in the main (67:34 - 67:38)
Series games and reduce them down to (67:36 - 67:40)
here's your Sinnoh Evo Stone (67:38 - 67:42)
uh Cleaver will appear more frequently (67:40 - 67:44)
in raids uh you'll have an increased (67:42 - 67:46)
chance of encountering shiny Cleaver (67:44 - 67:48)
speaking about odds I think the data (67:46 - 67:50)
miners were like this is about one in (67:48 - 67:52)
ten for these raid days (67:50 - 67:52)
um (67:52 - 67:56)
so a lot higher than the one in 20. uh (67:52 - 67:58)
you can earn up to five additional (67:56 - 68:00)
passes from spinning (67:58 - 68:03)
so if you play your cards right (68:00 - 68:06)
you can technically do seven for free (68:03 - 68:08)
you spend the day before to get your (68:06 - 68:11)
free raid pass you don't use it use it (68:08 - 68:13)
the next day and then you get your free (68:11 - 68:14)
rate pass then plus you get the other (68:13 - 68:17)
five so you can do seven cleavers (68:14 - 68:20)
for technically for free and then remote (68:17 - 68:24)
raid pass will go from 5 to 10 that will (68:20 - 68:27)
be available all day so instead of (68:24 - 68:29)
spending ten dollars Niantic has blessed (68:27 - 68:31)
you with the ability to spend twenty (68:29 - 68:33)
dollars no more than twenty how dare you (68:31 - 68:36)
spend you can only spend 20. not a (68:33 - 68:39)
single Cent more (68:36 - 68:39)
um (68:39 - 68:42)
I do think these events are good because (68:42 - 68:46)
they give you five free rate passes and (68:44 - 68:49)
I think that is good enough to encourage (68:46 - 68:51)
you to like when we always think of when (68:49 - 68:54)
we talk about like uh no one raids or no (68:51 - 68:56)
one does it or my community is only (68:54 - 68:59)
online I don't know how Niantic (68:56 - 69:02)
does that better to be like here's a (68:59 - 69:04)
brand new Pokemon that is shining right (69:02 - 69:06)
away and we're giving you five free raid (69:04 - 69:08)
passes like I I don't know how else they (69:06 - 69:10)
could like at that point it's all on you (69:08 - 69:12)
and your community like they're giving (69:10 - 69:15)
you everything every reason to go out (69:12 - 69:16)
and like (69:15 - 69:19)
these are something together (69:16 - 69:20)
there are three stars yeah so you really (69:19 - 69:23)
only need I mean if you're not level 40 (69:20 - 69:25)
you might need like two people but if (69:23 - 69:26)
you're level 50 you could probably solo (69:25 - 69:28)
these but (69:26 - 69:31)
I think the the (69:28 - 69:34)
remote raid passing aside (69:31 - 69:37)
I think this is a a good event like (69:34 - 69:40)
you can you realistically hopefully (69:37 - 69:43)
ideally I in a perfect world you're (69:40 - 69:44)
you're texting the same people that (69:43 - 69:46)
you're texting to go to go fast and (69:44 - 69:48)
you're saying hey Greg and will what are (69:46 - 69:50)
you doing on Saturday morning you want (69:48 - 69:52)
to go to mall America for 30 minutes (69:50 - 69:54)
because we can get seven done in 30 (69:52 - 69:56)
minutes (69:54 - 70:00)
and then Greg says no no I have to this (69:56 - 70:02)
Cleaver is on the day that I'm going to (70:00 - 70:03)
magiccon (70:02 - 70:06)
it wasn't going to magiccon he would say (70:03 - 70:08)
yes and we would go into America you (70:06 - 70:10)
would guilt me into it (70:08 - 70:12)
if they could evolve if you could evolve (70:10 - 70:14)
Scyther I would say it would be a pretty (70:12 - 70:15)
good event because then you could (70:14 - 70:18)
actually get the clever that you want (70:15 - 70:24)
but nope no Cleaver that you deserve (70:18 - 70:27)
[Laughter] (70:24 - 70:29)
the game the way Niantic wants you to (70:27 - 70:34)
play correct no other options remote yes (70:29 - 70:38)
everything aside it's a relatively good (70:34 - 70:41)
event I guess I don't know rates are not (70:38 - 70:43)
their strong point right now (70:41 - 70:45)
and they know it (70:43 - 70:50)
the only cost is your time yeah (70:45 - 70:52)
and like that CEO on Twitter said my (70:50 - 70:55)
time is worth five thousand dollars an (70:52 - 70:56)
hour (70:55 - 70:59)
uh last update here is trainers you can (70:56 - 71:01)
help outspark during the instinctive (70:59 - 71:03)
hero event (71:01 - 71:05)
um spark is busy running around with as (71:03 - 71:08)
Elekid and could use some research (71:05 - 71:11)
support there's a new event and for the (71:08 - 71:14)
first time in Pokemon go Larvesta will (71:11 - 71:17)
be able to hatch from eggs also randomly (71:14 - 71:20)
shiny Mantyke will be available (71:17 - 71:20)
why because sure yep just cause don't (71:21 - 71:27)
think about it (71:26 - 71:30)
it's a big hatching event you gotta get (71:27 - 71:32)
Mantyke from the eggs so there's a (71:30 - 71:35)
little bit (71:32 - 71:38)
like is my favorite [ __ ] (71:35 - 71:38)
um (71:38 - 71:42)
Larvesta the torch Pokemon and Volcarona (71:38 - 71:44)
the sun Pokemon make their Pokemon go (71:42 - 71:48)
debut Larvesta will hatch from 2 5 and (71:44 - 71:50)
10K eggs which I think is the first time (71:48 - 71:52)
I've ever done that that's cool it will (71:50 - 71:54)
also be the only Pokemon in those egg (71:52 - 71:57)
pools (71:54 - 71:57)
so it'll be the only thing you're (71:57 - 72:00)
hatching out of two five and 10K eggs (71:59 - 72:03)
for that event where am I getting the (72:00 - 72:07)
man takes from Seven case oh I see okay (72:03 - 72:10)
uh you need 400 Larvesta candy there's (72:07 - 72:13)
the 400 we all speculated you do need (72:10 - 72:15)
400. (72:13 - 72:18)
um increase chance of shiny from 2 5 and (72:15 - 72:19)
10. (72:18 - 72:22)
uh (72:19 - 72:22)
that's the event bonus they're saying it (72:22 - 72:27)
does say that maybe Deadpool is more (72:25 - 72:30)
than Larvesta oh their their blog post (72:27 - 72:34)
is uh contradicting itself oh no no I (72:30 - 72:36)
think they're saying that the 7ks will (72:34 - 72:39)
have increased to be clear Larvesta (72:36 - 72:42)
cannot be shiny yeah (72:39 - 72:42)
so the egg pool here is 2 5 and 10 will (72:42 - 72:48)
only have Larvesta like Hannah said and (72:46 - 72:49)
then (72:48 - 72:51)
7K eggs (72:49 - 72:53)
we'll have mime Jr (72:51 - 72:56)
I'm assuming that is location based (72:53 - 72:59)
although it's not saying happy knee (72:56 - 73:01)
Mantyke which can be shiny for the first (72:59 - 73:04)
time Tim bar Timber (73:01 - 73:08)
blast Shelmet axu and Gumi Gumi cannot (73:04 - 73:10)
be shiny (73:08 - 73:12)
um (73:10 - 73:12)
of that group oh yeah wait this is (73:12 - 73:16)
contradictory they're saying increased (73:15 - 73:19)
shiny chance of two five and ten all (73:16 - 73:21)
right well so either there is more than (73:19 - 73:23)
just Larvesta in these eggs which makes (73:21 - 73:24)
it a worse event than I want it to be (73:23 - 73:27)
that I'm thinking it is or there's maybe (73:24 - 73:29)
increased chances of shiny in the seven (73:27 - 73:31)
case or there's just no increased (73:29 - 73:33)
chances of shiny at all (73:31 - 73:35)
one way or another the blog post is (73:33 - 73:38)
confusing (73:35 - 73:38)
uh okay hold on there there was a (73:40 - 73:45)
question asked in the Niantic area (73:42 - 73:48)
about this (73:45 - 73:48)
and Niantic responded it will not be the (73:48 - 73:54)
only Pokemon okay there will be (73:52 - 73:57)
additional Pokemon in these pools that (73:54 - 73:58)
makes it a worse event I was really (73:57 - 74:00)
excited about it that's much worse (73:58 - 74:03)
that's not a good answer so we got the (74:00 - 74:05)
clarification here from Niantic there (74:03 - 74:08)
will be other Pokemon in the two five (74:05 - 74:10)
and ten I think the blog post is just (74:08 - 74:14)
saying Larvesta is the new one in the T5 (74:10 - 74:16)
and 10. have they announced the May (74:14 - 74:18)
Community today yet (74:16 - 74:21)
no no (74:18 - 74:24)
no we don't know what may is (74:21 - 74:26)
um (74:24 - 74:26)
okay got that all out of the way so (74:26 - 74:30)
bonuses are (74:28 - 74:33)
increased shinies from 2 5 10 2 5 and 10 (74:30 - 74:36)
not Larvesta two times hatch XP two (74:33 - 74:38)
times Stardust from hatching (74:36 - 74:39)
um (74:38 - 74:42)
there will be a special research (74:39 - 74:44)
where (74:42 - 74:47)
you can get a Elekid wearing a sparked (74:44 - 74:50)
theme accessory one single Ellicott just (74:47 - 74:52)
like one single Lapras yup what is this (74:50 - 74:56)
Ellicott wearing like a wristband (74:52 - 74:57)
can't (74:56 - 75:00)
I can't I'm trying to see on the picture (74:57 - 75:02)
yeah it's got a risk it's got a (75:00 - 75:04)
wristband it's got the Instinct symbol (75:02 - 75:07)
on its forearm (75:04 - 75:09)
yeah yes (75:07 - 75:12)
there will be field research that's it (75:09 - 75:15)
well I mean Lapras was like a bow from (75:12 - 75:17)
blanche's hair that you couldn't see (75:15 - 75:21)
because you can never see the back side (75:17 - 75:23)
uh in field research you'll get Magneton (75:21 - 75:26)
Chansey Electabuzz Magmar Snorlax man (75:23 - 75:28)
Mantine (75:26 - 75:32)
and then chimeko (75:28 - 75:33)
look (75:32 - 75:35)
if anything Niantic has been consistent (75:33 - 75:38)
with Rising Heroes being the worst (75:35 - 75:40)
season so far so they're just look (75:38 - 75:45)
you're just double hero not the event (75:40 - 75:47)
I was really excited about this event (75:45 - 75:50)
until that clarification I'm glad you (75:47 - 75:53)
brought it up because I I was like oh (75:50 - 75:54)
okay well I'm glad we got the (75:53 - 75:57)
clarification live on the show instead (75:54 - 75:59)
of like after (75:57 - 76:01)
um (75:59 - 76:03)
uh that's it that's that's all we there (76:01 - 76:04)
was a lot of Pokemon goodness we got (76:03 - 76:06)
through it all there's probably some (76:04 - 76:09)
other news that it's not important the (76:06 - 76:11)
we talked about the important stuff in (76:09 - 76:13)
Pokemon go right now is in a weird place (76:11 - 76:16)
we'll see what happens to (76:13 - 76:16)
I think the raid pass thing just ends up (76:18 - 76:21)
being like the footprint thing where (76:19 - 76:24)
people will never drop it it will just (76:21 - 76:26)
be a constant talking point and (76:24 - 76:28)
niantical (76:26 - 76:31)
the footprints ain't coming back (76:28 - 76:34)
yeah I at this point do not expect it to (76:31 - 76:36)
come back do not expect it to be (76:34 - 76:39)
addressed I just think the game is in a (76:36 - 76:41)
weird place the story lines have (76:39 - 76:43)
completely stopped for the most part (76:41 - 76:45)
they're not having as much research you (76:43 - 76:48)
can do more things cost money (76:45 - 76:49)
um (76:48 - 76:51)
I'm feeling weird about the game and (76:49 - 76:53)
this is and I'm someone who loves who (76:51 - 76:55)
has loved the game and all the (76:53 - 76:56)
communities that it's helped me be a (76:55 - 76:59)
part of so I don't know where it's going (76:56 - 77:01)
from here and I'll try to get to a go (76:59 - 77:03)
Fest (77:01 - 77:03)
yeah I mean go Fest are (77:04 - 77:08)
the in-person events are what Niantic (77:06 - 77:11)
has done best minus you know issues here (77:08 - 77:13)
and here with like you again I feel like (77:11 - 77:14)
the the (77:13 - 77:16)
Vegas thing was like completely (77:14 - 77:18)
overblown (77:16 - 77:19)
like I was there (77:18 - 77:22)
it was it didn't work for a little bit (77:19 - 77:24)
they fixed it once they fixed it was (77:22 - 77:25)
relatively smooth (77:24 - 77:27)
they gave us four more hours of play (77:25 - 77:29)
time in the afternoon Sunday was (77:27 - 77:32)
flaw-free like things happen it's really (77:29 - 77:34)
hard to plan Live Events (77:32 - 77:36)
um and (77:34 - 77:38)
all the other go fests like the Berlin (77:36 - 77:41)
go Fest the Seattle go Fest the German (77:38 - 77:44)
ego no sorry Berlin (77:41 - 77:44)
um (77:44 - 77:48)
the South Korea Safari Zone (77:44 - 77:50)
they all were flaw they are they're all (77:48 - 77:52)
like I don't say flaw free I would like (77:50 - 77:54)
say like 98 (77:52 - 77:57)
good like they're like in Berlin there (77:54 - 77:59)
was like one dead spot in the park where (77:57 - 78:01)
it was like oh no service like for the (77:59 - 78:03)
like 60 seconds until I walk through and (78:01 - 78:04)
okay like all spawns are back now like (78:03 - 78:07)
just avoid this like one part like the (78:04 - 78:09)
park was so huge it took like an hour to (78:07 - 78:11)
get to the other side anyways it's very (78:09 - 78:14)
easy to avoid that like one like Bridge (78:11 - 78:15)
um (78:14 - 78:17)
they do really shine in Live Events and (78:15 - 78:20)
I I absolutely love their Live Events I (78:17 - 78:21)
would like to go to all of these events (78:20 - 78:23)
I don't know if that's possible but (78:21 - 78:25)
um it seems that at least our community (78:23 - 78:27)
in both like slack and Discord are like (78:25 - 78:29)
oh over the moon excited for like New (78:27 - 78:31)
York event and it's really cool like at (78:29 - 78:33)
the end of the day whether or not you're (78:31 - 78:35)
upset with Niantic at the end of the day (78:33 - 78:37)
like it is really cool to see all these (78:35 - 78:40)
people plan their weekend together and (78:37 - 78:42)
like they're very excited to like meet (78:40 - 78:44)
each other and hang out and play Pokemon (78:42 - 78:46)
go and like that's kind of the core of (78:44 - 78:48)
this game is (78:46 - 78:50)
like I want to do I want to play this (78:48 - 78:53)
game with you in person and and go out (78:50 - 78:54)
and explore a city (78:53 - 78:58)
um just the the the thing not talked (78:54 - 79:01)
about is the price to do that (78:58 - 79:04)
but like if there was if we lived in a (79:01 - 79:07)
world with like no cost uh and traveling (79:04 - 79:10)
was easy and cheap uh this would be a (79:07 - 79:13)
better experience for everyone but (79:10 - 79:16)
um there's limitations of course (79:13 - 79:16)
uh (79:17 - 79:22)
hopefully (79:19 - 79:24)
whatever comes after Rising Heroes is (79:22 - 79:25)
much better than this (79:24 - 79:28)
yep falling villains (79:25 - 79:31)
[Laughter] (79:28 - 79:34)
uh does rising Heroes end before it ends (79:31 - 79:36)
before August though right I think like (79:34 - 79:38)
Rising Heroes ends in like June does it (79:36 - 79:40)
not I mean it's only three eight seasons (79:38 - 79:43)
three months right yeah yeah and didn't (79:40 - 79:44)
Rising hero started at the beginning of (79:43 - 79:46)
April (79:44 - 79:49)
or did it start in March (79:46 - 79:52)
I thought I had to find that I think (79:49 - 79:53)
when you go into the here I'm loading (79:52 - 79:54)
the app I think when you go to the app (79:53 - 79:55)
it tells you how many days are exactly (79:54 - 79:57)
left yeah (79:55 - 80:01)
uh 31 days and 18 hours there we go so (79:57 - 80:03)
maybe we just have to maybe we just have (80:01 - 80:06)
to suffer 31 more days (80:03 - 80:06)
look they announced the raid pass thing (80:08 - 80:12)
during the worst season can't be a (80:09 - 80:14)
coincidence they just wanted to make (80:12 - 80:16)
sure that the season was memorable for (80:14 - 80:19)
all the wrong reasons (80:16 - 80:19)
if we can all Lego (80:22 - 80:27)
there is really what I'm saying (80:24 - 80:31)
we know that that is not true you cannot (80:27 - 80:35)
say we could only go up from here (80:31 - 80:40)
this is not by any means rock bottom (80:35 - 80:40)
yeah (80:41 - 80:46)
they could remove remote right passes (80:43 - 80:48)
all together but I feel like half the (80:46 - 80:50)
audience thinks they already did that no (80:48 - 80:52)
they like I think I'll never get another (80:50 - 80:54)
legendary again no you can still (80:52 - 80:57)
remember right (80:54 - 80:59)
you can still get one legendary every (80:57 - 81:02)
week if you wanted to you can still get (80:59 - 81:03)
free remote raid passes from the (81:02 - 81:05)
research as well (81:03 - 81:07)
um like they're not there's a chance of (81:05 - 81:10)
it yeah but (81:07 - 81:13)
they're not they're not completely gone (81:10 - 81:15)
you could still do it (81:13 - 81:17)
not very efficient (81:15 - 81:19)
but still doable (81:17 - 81:21)
anyways thanks for breaking to the end (81:19 - 81:25)
uh if you are (81:21 - 81:28)
watching on YouTube uh I guess let us (81:25 - 81:29)
know if you're going to go Fest if (81:28 - 81:33)
you're going to New York London Osaka (81:29 - 81:34)
um (81:33 - 81:36)
if you're or I mean if you're not if (81:34 - 81:38)
you're not going to go Fest or liking (81:36 - 81:40)
the Go part you're probably not even (81:38 - 81:41)
listening to this part of the show (81:40 - 81:43)
you probably skipped this which is (81:41 - 81:44)
understandable that's why I put the time (81:43 - 81:46)
stamps in you know if you don't care (81:44 - 81:50)
about you know TCG easy to skip that (81:46 - 81:52)
um but if you're going uh let us know in (81:50 - 81:53)
the comments if you're going to the go (81:52 - 81:55)
Fest which one you're going to uh all (81:53 - 81:57)
maybe also if you bought all the add-ons (81:55 - 81:59)
I'd be very curious if you just bought a (81:57 - 82:02)
base ticket or if you went all out and (81:59 - 82:05)
spent 120 on everything (82:02 - 82:07)
um (82:05 - 82:08)
did you get that t-shirt that you have (82:07 - 82:10)
no clue what it looks like (82:08 - 82:14)
I'm sure it's going to be lovely oh uh (82:10 - 82:16)
Niantic has never dropped the ball on a (82:14 - 82:18)
t-shirt I actually don't know who makes (82:16 - 82:20)
the t-shirt is that I guess it would be (82:18 - 82:23)
probably Niantic right oh (82:20 - 82:26)
they may uh they probably hire somebody (82:23 - 82:29)
to do the design right yeah yeah I mean (82:26 - 82:31)
they have to have an in-house design (82:29 - 82:33)
team I don't think the person who does (82:31 - 82:36)
the loading screen is yeah in-house yeah (82:33 - 82:40)
are they yes oh okay okay (82:36 - 82:40)
um they get three months to work on one (82:40 - 82:44)
loading screen at a time and they always (82:42 - 82:45)
knock out the park they always do a (82:44 - 82:48)
great job there's other art in the game (82:45 - 82:51)
there's the logos there's the characters (82:48 - 82:53)
that's awesome there's the team leader I (82:51 - 82:55)
only play the game for the loading (82:53 - 82:56)
screen and the loading screen only (82:55 - 82:58)
Hannah the team little redesign was (82:56 - 83:00)
something (82:58 - 83:03)
