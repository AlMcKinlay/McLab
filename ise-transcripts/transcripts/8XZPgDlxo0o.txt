having me out this is like my fifth year here but before i go into that this is a pokemon panel so if you don't like pokemon you're probably in the wrong room and my name is sbj i am the host of a podcast called it's super effective there hey there's my logo up there and before we get into things how many of you actually listen to the podcast raise his hands hey look at that some people cool awesome well thanks for coming out if you don't listen to the podcast it's a really terrible show on itunes um has a couple thousand downloads a week but uh we do record weekly and uh you can get on itunes and stitcher and soundcloud so if you like podcasts that's that's uh something we do weekly talk about pokemon it's normally just not me i'm pretty boring so i bring in some guests from time to time so let's start hey there we go so i never know what to talk about at these panels because as we saw from the raise of hands uh some of you don't listen to my show so i try to be general try to be specific not specific so i can at least appeal to everyone here and hopefully not waste your next hour yeah so with that being said we're gonna i'm gonna go through the 20 years of pokemon and try to give you a recap and hopefully blow your mind with some stuff you might not know about pokemon uh if i get some things wrong i'm sorry i tried my best last night until 4am to get something worthwhile for you guys so we're gonna go through the 20 years and then five time which will probably happen because i blow through content pretty fast uh we can do a q a at the end and you guys can answer ques ask questions and i will answer them to the best of my ability that's usually my favorite part and that's the last couple years that's what we ended up doing for the majority of the time so this will be about the 20 years of pokemon we know nothing about pokemon sun and moon so i will touch on that in a little bit but just so you know like everything from there speculation all right let's start awesome so i'm going to remind myself that february 27 1996 is the japanese date of when pokemon red and green came out in japan of course and then september 28th is when it came to north america later on the slide's gonna flip the north american date and the japanese day because it's not as relevant as it is from here now obviously pokemon just celebrated its 20th anniversary on february 27th that was uh pokemon day where you could get cards from toys r us and and the virtual console games for red blue and yellow were available in the eshop so maybe some things you don't know about pokemon red and blue it received a 10 out of 10 from ign it was called the masterpiece jigglypuff and wigglytuff's name so in early in development i thought this was uh somewhat of a fun fact they were originally supposed to be named pudding and custard before their names were changed to jigglypuff and wigglytuff there were a bunch of other names that were changed prior the only other one that i thought was kind of funny it was a vulpix was supposed to be named foxfire not to get confused with firefox all right so they originally wanted to have the re to the ability to rebattle any trainer throughout the game that was cut last minute due to time that was something that was then introduced i believe in gold and silver you guys know more than i do uh there was also supposed to be a female trainer playable but that was also cut we didn't see that until crystal if i'm not mistaken and then what else do we have here lance's dragonite nose barrier it's uh dragonite can't actually learn barrier at all uh i believe a couple months ago maybe even a year ago lance's dragonite was given away as a gift from digital download and it did no barrier then what else do we have here some stuff you can't see on the screen because i only had room for so many bullet points drowsy sprite has five fingers in red and blue it's actually supposed to only have three some pokemon share the same cries back in red and blue the original exam some examples are charizard and rye horn have the same cry ditto and poliwag share the same cry and goldeen and caterpie have the same exact cry so if you're going through a virtual console right now playing red and blue getting your pokemon ready for sun and moon that's something you can notice also finally to round out red and blue here is hi i like shorts they're comfy and easy to wear was a very popular meme that came from red and blue it was referenced again in pokemon black and white 2 where another trainer does say that all right gold and silver now reminding myself that the north american date is now on top and the japanese date is on the bottom here so we have almost a three year difference between uh when red and blue came out and gold and silver so gold silver added 100 new pokemon brought it up to 251 battle music is different during the day at night these are the only games where the battle music is different between day and night obviously in some games they got rid of the day and night cycle but when you're battling gold silver the music is slightly different depending on what time of day it is moon balls never worked still don't don't know if they could release it on virtual console they will fix it moon balls don't work as they were planned they were supposed to increase the catch rate times four when trying to catch pokemon that involves using a moonstone so your jigglypuff or your clefairy instead they were programmed to increase the catch rate when you try to catch a pokemon that uses a burn heel which of course will never happen because a wild pokemon will never use burn heal on itself skateboarding was a form of transportation that was in gold and silver that they ended up cutting and they just left with the bicycle and if we saw an x and y they went with some roller blades which which i was a big fan of but uh it would kind of be cool to have a skateboard i guess in like the early 2000s skateboarding was real big like tony hawk pro skater 2 was a real big fad there's a lot of glitches in gold and silver due to a glitch in the game's code burn paralysis and poison status don't affect the catch rate of a pokemon so paralyzing or poisoning a pokemon does not increase the catch rate when it's supposed to uh steel and dark these two types were introduced to balance out psychic in the game because uh psychic was too powerful and at the time psychic was only weak against bug so that's why uh steel and dark type was added and those were the two newest types until we got ferry and then the gym in goldenrod city is laid out like the shape of a clefairy i don't have a picture of that but if you go through and you look at how the flowers are arranged in that gym it actually makes out to be a clefairy and i could probably talk about how whitney's melt tank is the worst but you guys probably all know that all right march 19 2003 is when ruby and sapphire came out november 21st in japan japan loves their uh november release dates for pokemon uh ruby and sapphire added a lot they also removed a lot uh one of the big things that kind of bothered me is you can no longer name your rival which was a bit of a bummer uh ruby and sapphire is the only main series game where you actually meet your father [Music] very hard times in the pokemon world ruby and sapphire introduced pokemon abilities and it also introduced battles of double battles on top of that it introduced natures as well as stat changes regarding evs and ivs and it also added pokemon contests so these were the first games on the gameboy advance these games also cut off compatibility between red and blue and gold and silver you can no longer trade that's why in the future we get uh fire red and leaf green if you're keeping count of the amount of pokemon added ruby and sapphire added 135 new pokemon they also added a bunch of pokeballs so my favorite pokeball is the premiere ball which is that white ball with the red ring around it ah that was added ruby and sapphire it just looks fancy it doesn't really do anything it looks sweet though the repeat ball was added which makes easy it makes it easier to catch pokemon that were already caught the timer ball was added which uh if you're struggling in a very long battle the timer ball makes that easy the nest ball was it you see a theme here the nest ball was added which makes lower level pokemon easier to catch the net ball was added to catch the internet no i mean uh it's against water pokemon and bug pokemon dive ball was added to catch siege wally pokemon and the luxury ball was added to make the capture of pokemon more comfortable and friendly with its trainers so ruby and sapphire went balls crazy on april 22nd 2007. got some diamond that's because all the hoenn fans are satisfied now so now we can get excited for diamond referral here uh introduced april 22nd september 28th in japan these were games that actually got me back into pokemon i stepped away from pokemon during gem 3. that was the time when i was in middle school and gosh forbid you talk about pokemon to get made fun of but i was in high school when pokemon was cool again and so everyone jumped on the diamond pro bandwagon some of my favorite games so this is the first game where the pokemon lab your professor is not actually located in your hometown it's also the first pokemon game that added wi-fi uh with like the gts trading battling it also added voice chat as well so i think a lot of people forget that i think you know we've been playing pokemon for 20 years that we just take what we have given but it was actually only uh less than 10 years ago we we finally got wi-fi and everything route 218 i'm like trying to think of why i wrote that down um so within route 218 inside one of the hallway type buildings there is a guard who will tell you how thirsty he is however bringing him a drink won't do anything but this is a reference to the original games in red blue green and yellow in which a player must bring a drink to the guard in saffron city to pass i suppose i could have a presentation about how all the games reference each other in some way but picked out a couple if you're keeping track 107 new pokemon were added in diamond and pearl a new battle system was used in diamond and pearl this battle system separated attacks from physical and special so if an enemy is actually touched when attacked it's considered physical if it's not it's considered special you guys probably all know that but this was considered pretty controversial at the time because you know anytime you change somebody's pokemon game they're going to freak out and people did freak out but then it's it was fine everything is always fine black and white all right march 6 2011. that's when we got black and white with 156 new pokemon today uh you noticed that i'm only doing main series games uh but i do want to point out that between every main series game that's been three to four years that's why it makes so much sense that we're getting sun and moon this year and not like a pokemon z or anything because it has been three full years which is the apparently the pokemon trigger for must-have new game the sword of justice pokemon does anyone know who those are uh [Music] so some of you guys said it right it's kabalye tarakian parisian and keldeo those are the sword of justice there's a movie about it that's very bad but they are actually based on the three musketeers i'm going to slaughter some names here but kubali and taraki and varision are based on atheos porthos and armis armies hermes there we go that's why you guys are here now you're thinking three musketeers what what about good old keldeo kelly was the youngest muskie tear based on d-arc there you guys go i should just replace you with me this would go way smoother callestia city floor 22 does anyone know what's there oh see if we got what like we got like two people who got it uh no curium is not on 422. um game three has its own building because castalia city they appear on the the 22nd floor which is the same floor of their real-life office tower which is the carrot tower in tokyo japan so yeah did i blow anyone's mind there slightly uh there was a lot of dsi specific features i'll get back to the tms in a second so the reason i put the dsi features is because we have the new three the new 3ds not to be confused with the non-new 3ds and so black and white did take advantage of the dsi so again just speculating that i would i would hope and assume that sun and moon take advantages of the new 3ds but still work on the original 3ds just like black and white did but some of the specific features are the games can connect to routers with a wpa connection that's just technical but that was a feature a camera can be used during x transceiver uh communications with other players the c gear shows the system power using three battery bars instead of two very fancy there and on the home screen the handheld console the little pokeball will actually wiggle instead of not moving it off so very minor features that the dsi had but the game freak did put into some consideration if you were using the new hardware and finally tms have infinite use no longer do you have to go to the fourth floor of the pokemark in saladon city and buy a bunch of tms over and over by your ice beam tmz have infinite use which was a big welcoming change i think to black and white all right i like how you guys cheer for games it's exciting we have more games after this spoiler all right so on october 12 2013 our first worldwide release of pokemon x and pokemon y 72 new pokemon this is the smallest amount of pokemon they added to a new main series game just keep that in mind for sun and moon uh they did add fairy types [Music] political debate in here about fairy type uh this type was added to balance out dragon which was dragon was only weak to dragon and ice so fairy type was added to balance that out fair attacks if you did not know are strong against dragon fighting and dark types they resist fire poisoned steel ferry are only weak to poison and steal they resist fighting bug dark and they are immune to dragon attacks x and y is when we got mega evolutions which was pokemon's cop-out of not giving us a fourth evolution and increasing the pokedex even more but i'm actually very happy with mega evolutions i like how it doesn't bog down the pokedex and i like that it makes pokemon like charizard actually bearable i'm just kidding charizard's cool lucario not so much if you visit the pokemon center on your birthday you do get a special birthday wish i don't know if any of you guys knew that but that's a little fun fact this is the first pokemon game in 3d prior to that we had sprites and everything so that was a very major change to the series it was also the first game because of worldwide release it was available in seven different languages which you can pick at the beginning if you wanted to hone your italian right off the bat you can do so according to masuda who is uh in charge of the pokemon the pokeman on november 18th he stated that when x and y was in development it had over 500 people working on it including localization and it took 3.5 years to make and pokemon x and y ended the ever so popular sky battles that was sarcasm but horde battles i think are still pretty popular especially for your eb and your iv training and uh it added pokemon to me it added the pss the player search system and it added super training [Applause] so i do have some information about sunday news sunday sun and moon sun and news all right breaking information these games are compatible with pokemon bank let's see what's your first fact uh specifically they are compatible with the uh red blue and yellow virtual console games we don't have a way to move those pokemon to uh any game but they will only move to sun and moon they won't move to x and y according to pokemon's website these are also going to be the first pokemon games released in chinese which is just very popular because china is a big land mass and it was stated that this will be a worldwide release again all right that's pretty much all i have for the main series games so based on oh i have all right more uh so based on what we saw the lowest amount of pokemon new pokemon we got was uh 76 and the highest we got was 150 so pick a number between there i'm assuming that's how many new pokemon we're gonna get um and i don't know if it's based off the current engine but it's been in development for three years at least to our knowledge and that there was no pokemon game last year so i would assume that this will be drastically different but uh they're supposed to be supposedly a coracora core car is a magazine that comes out in japan and it's supposed to come out i think in two to three weeks and there will suppose supposedly be new information regarding summit moon there so but we got plenty of time for that so instead of looking into the future with sun and moon let's go into the past and look at all the pokemon spin-off games some some being good some being bad so let's man i feel like pokemon snap is like you shouldn't bring it up because people just freak out how good it is so pokemon snap actually only had 63 of the 151 pokemon appear in it uh it was rumored that there was supposed to be 64 pokemon because it is the nintendo 64. uh and there was actual screenshots of ekans being take uh having pictures taken of it but atkins does not actually appear in the game which is kind of why it makes sense that there's 63 because if there was accident atkins we would be at the right number for the fad that was 64. and then pokemon pinball very popular game boy color game at least to me it's the only pinball game i actually kind of liked uh fun fact about that is miu can appear at the end of the game as a catchable pokemon but you can't actually catch it because of the limitation of the ram inside a gameboy cartridge it would require you to hit mu over a thousand times in two minutes in order to catch it which was never possible but if you did encounter mew you did unlock its pokedex entry so i think they knew that they messed up yeah more spin-offs all right so we have the pokemon training card game uh which i remember getting on easter i was so excited it was the best easter ever had the easter bunny was very good to me that year when i was a kid in pokemon stadium as well which was very popular um so making i feel like i'm going a little fast so i could tell this wrestling story i have about pokemon stadium you guys are thinking wrestling right but i'll tell him because i think it's okay i think it's kind of a good story i've never told in my podcast so you guys are first to hear it it's maybe it's not that good i don't know so bear with me here until i get to the pokemon part of it so i was in sixth grade when pokemon stadium came out and i was livid i was so excited to get it but also in sixth grade i was a i came upon wwe and i thought man this is the coolest show sixth grade it's like 11 years old watching wwe every night it was on with my parents and uh so in sixth grade of course you know you're in a new environment you want to try to be active trying to make new friends so pokemon was already very vague and secure i had that covered had all my pokemon friends we were good but i like wwe so much looking at all the sports and i'm not athletic at all and i'm like wrestling i love wwe i want to be a wrestler and my parents were like you know it's not the same and i said no mom i want to be a wrestler they're so they have cool entrances they have hi bro they're so cool mom so they were like okay put you into wrestling so i don't know if you guys know what it's like to have a coach yelling at you on the sideline but then to also have your dad yelling at you at the sideline to do stuff during a wrestling match which is not fun i hated wrestling my parents were right it was nothing like i wanted i'm not athletic i didn't have the anger to tackle another guy i just thought that i'd wear a cool outfit and have pyro one day it was a terrible experience so i went to every wrestling meet i went to every wrestling school event i went to every night of training just hating it absolutely hating it and i didn't win a single match probably did 30 or 40 matches in my weight class i think i was like 99 pounds back then i was 11 years old so it was very very rare if i even got somebody that matched my weight that wasn't like seven years old and could easily take me out me being 11. so finally after going to all these events i finally win my first match and i barely won it and the entire time coach is yelling at me my dad is yelling at me grab his leg don't grab his leg go from behind don't go from behind and i won and instead of my dad being proud he told me that i was lucky that i barely won because i made so many mistakes my dad's not a nice person so we go back on my losing spree i keep losing i keep losing i keep losing and pokemon stadium came out and i begged my dad for it i was like dad you got me every pokemon game you got me pokemon pinball the day it was released i mean pokemon silver the day was released can i have pokemon stadium and the answer was no it's not your birthday it's not your christmas you're too spoiled you can't have pokemon city so we're at the school meet wrestling dad's there getting ready to yell at me what to do and he pulls me aside he goes son you win this match we will go to toys r us we will get you pokemon stadium school wrestling not like real wrestling in fake or fake wrestling there's a three count one two three again really cool pyro cool outfits three count in real wrestling school wrestling it's only a one count your shoulders down one you're done you're out so they partnered me up with the person in my weight class feeling really good i have to win this there's pokemon stadium on the line and we we start the wrestling match and i'm winning i'm you get points in wrestling if you like tackle their leg or you get behind them you get points so you can win two ways you get either enough points time limit runs up or you pin the person i've never pinned anyone i lost a lot so i'm winning i'm winning i'm going through round after round i'm in the lead i'm in the lead i'm doing it we're in the last round i have three points ahead even if he got behind me and got an extra point i was so good i was golden and something happened and i can't remember when so fast and all of a sudden i was pinned and i lost with 20 seconds left in the match to go all i needed to do was wait 20 more seconds and i would have had pokemon so you guys thought this was going to be a heavy ending it wasn't i lost and i lost my chance at pokemon stadium and that was my story uh i did end up getting pokemon stadium for my birthday and i absolutely loved it but pope my name will always have a place in my heart for reminding me that i absolutely hated anything athletic especially wrestling and that i know one day when i have kids i will use pokemon to drive them to do great things [Music] all right one of these games is my favorite it's not hey you pikachu i was a very big fan of pokemon puzzling still i'm a very big fan of pokemon puzzle league i don't have any real fun facts about these games pokemon puzzle league is the only pokemon game from last time i checked which was not released in japan that was a fun fact i showed last year uh pokemon p i hate pikachu's just garbage so that's your fun fact there all right we got more spin-off titles so we're in 2003 we got pokemon channel which if you thought hey you pikachu is bad we're going down and we got pokemon pinball ruby and sapphire which is actually also a very good pinball game i built an arcade cabinet with my friend aaron and we put a gamecube in it and we put a gameboy player in it and so the arcade cabinet has like paddles on the side and has face buttons so we pretty much built a pokemon pinball machine uh which i bring to the midwestern classic which is in brookville wisconsin every year so it's kind of cool it exists it's something i kind of built more spin-offs since from 2004 to 2005 we have pokemon dash the only pokemon racing game which doesn't say much because it wasn't very good and we have pokemon coliseum as well uh not much to share about these games i guess these again so 2004 2013 this was kind of when i was at pokemon uh more spin-offs gamecube just landed down with pokemon games pokemon xd gale of darkness uh so i can't remember is this called shadow lugia which uh we have shadow mewtwo in pokken tournament which we'll get to uh but safe to say that probably shadow mewtwo is going to stay in pokken tournament just like shadow lugia stayed in caleb darkness the main series game had no space for shadoluya and then if you like puzzle games pokemon troj that exists pokemon spin-off so this is 2006. uh we have pokemon ranger and this is very interesting so when we were in the ds uh mystery dungeon had a game boy advanced specific game which is red rescue team and then a3 uh 2ds or 2ds regular ds uno ds blue rescue team i've never played any of these games but i heard these are some of the more popular mystery dungeon games um i played gates to infinity and did not enjoy it uh we have more pokemon ranger because yokai watch was an early fad back then as you can see by that little trainer that looks like yokai watch and then we have pokemon battle revolution which i thought would be awesome i thought this was pokemon stadium 3. it was not it's like pokemon state in point five uh it was it was cool though it's uh battle revolution was cool because this was before x and y so we actually got decently looking 3d pokemon again and boy were they pumping out spinoffs back then all right we have explorers of the sky mystery dungeon it's very crazy in 2008 2009 and then we have explorers of darkness and explorers of time i didn't play any of these games either did you guys uh we have which you might think i would hate but pokey parkway is actually a pretty cool game and the pokemon the actual pokemon models on the game are legit they are really cool i feel like these people also like firing them so we have pokemon conquest and then we have uh pokey park two wonders beyond again pokey park if you want a mindless game that looks really good and it's kind of funny pokey park is not bad uh and then pokemon rumble blast which is a mindless game that does not have the good character that pokey park has more spin-offs we have uh gates is that infinity yeah not a good game uh we have pokemon rumble u which is it's okay it has uh amiibos before they wear amiibos 2014. can't believe this was only two years ago we have pokemon battle troj which is okay and then pokemon art academy to teach you how to draw squirtle just as badly 2015. more mystery dungeons super mystery dungeon to be exact pokemon shuffle which i adore pokemon shuffle i usually don't like free to play games don't really play games on my iphone but pokemon shuffle game is red it's really good uh pokemon rumble world again it was an eshop game free to play but there is a digital or there is a physical copy release available and the pokemon pick cross which is okay it's across it exists and then finally 2016. okay i was going to ask it doesn't matter it's ask audience who has pokemon but from the round of applause yes pokken is really good uh it is i did i did a full review on it on my podcast it's about 45 minutes of me going through pokem before it was released obviously you guys can play the game for yourself but if you're still on defense for pokken i would say that if you like super smash brothers you would like pokken if you don't like smash brothers tokens probably not going to seal the deal for you i mean unless you play smash brothers because of the pokemon okay you could probably get pokken but if you don't like anything in smash brothers you're probably not going to like pokken i'm very bad at fighting games i've lost a lot of times already but it's still good and i plan on playing it every thursday night with uh with my pokemon community so if that's something you're into if you want to beat me because i'm very easily beaten in pokken there we go also my favorite pokemon is machamp i never was a big machamp fan but playing with champion pokken realized made me realize that he was the wrestler i wanted to be and then finally we can do some q and a if you guys have any questions i will answer them we have about 20 minutes not a good time right here i mean tournament it's not like another word uh so the poker tournament is made by the people who made tekken from nam ko bandai so you would think that pokken would be more like tekken but it's not but it's made by the tekken team so that's where the pokken comes from if somebody's hand go up and then go down there yeah most important question i've ever had about pokemon what do you tips doing uh annoy you i don't remember that i only played through x and y at once but um i don't remember what the tips do i was going to say they actually increased like your coolness and i have access to the hiring your coolness that's something i still struggle with way in the back will they ever bring back shadow pokemon well we have shadow mewtwo now in pokken and we have we had chattalookia but i think to be honest i think that's something that is for spin-off games i don't think that's something for the main series game i don't know how you would introduce that in the main series without making that like a type or something like we have dark we have ghosts i don't know how you would introduce that without offsetting the balance i was always a big like i always thought that fairy wasn't the last type they were ever going to do if you listen to my podcast i'm very big on them introducing like a sound type because there's so many sound type moves in the game the growl roar sonic boom explode is a pokemon that exists noiburn has a giant boombox on its head uh but i don't know without i i'm starting to think it's too soon to introduce a new type just because we still have fairy trying to work out with dragon but i don't think shadow would ever be like a type or anything to bring in i think that's kind of like a spin-off now that we've seen it twice with lugia and mewtwo i think that's kind of a spin-off thing i could be wrong though shadow mewtwo could be the main bad guy in sun moon sunday news right over here the shadow pokemon ghost pokemon are actually ghosts yes i do think so uh you have well you have a you have a bunch of ghost pokemon you have ghastly haunter and gengar obviously they can go through walls if you play pokken gengar goes right through the grass appears behind you throws a giant punch at you out of nowhere um but uh there are other ghost pokemon like golurk i believe it's a ghost right yeah ghost ground but he was actually made by man he's man-made uh pokemon just like genesect and mewtwo so i don't know how that works how people can make a ghost but girl looks cool if you ever watch the black and white movie he turns into a giant rocket blast into the air you can't go wrong with that in the back i took notes because i knew somebody was gonna ask that uh i really like water pokemon which is funny and funny about me is i can't swim at all again going back back to me not being athletic i can't wrestle i can't swim i can't talk uh but i really like water pokemon a lot i like i have a new found addiction to ducklit i think duckling is real cool uh real awesome swanda though swanna's lame i get it like the swan and the duck i get it but swanna you're not cool i'll keep a duckling okay uh so my favorite pokemon ever is farfetch and if farfetch could get a mega evolution i could die happy because firebatch is real cool um i always thought machamp should get a mega evolution if you look at red and blue uh machamp is the complete opposite in every aspect of alakazam the you need to trade cadaver you need to trade machoke uh alakazam is all about special attack when champs is all about physical attack they're complete opposites and i think they were exclusive to each other's game too i could be wrong on that but uh machamp feels like a given for a mega evolution so i feel like that's gonna happen uh farfetch is a dream that i want to happen um i think though hypno is very forgotten about and mega evolution like restores people's faith back into certain pokemon like no one cared about beedrill and then they gave it mega bee drone you're like yeah beetroot's cool now he's real cool um so if you were to ask me like more pokemon i would say pokemon that are forgotten about like hypno like bear tick like huntail like to me those all deserve mega evolutions because they're they get forgotten about them they're cool well hypno maybe not so much the center yeah uh the question was the concept of about pokemon capturing animals and forcing them to fight yes i think i think pokemon does a lot of things and i think that's forgotten about especially for people who don't play pokemon or people who go oh pokemon's still a thing there's a lot of aspects of pokemon like competitive battling and you see that in like the super bowl commercial i don't know if you guys saw the super bowl commercial that pokemon did but it wasn't it wasn't about two animals fighting it was about competing at like a strategic level and what having people watch and be excited about competition and how like that brings people together that's why you get so many people watching football yeah anyone could play football i'd go out and attempt to throw a football but it's about like bringing people together and like sharing strategies and competitively battling and having that form around that central thought but then there are other aspects like trading and collecting for me i'm not a competitive battler because i'm not good at it but i'm all about trying to fill out my pokedex i'm all about getting the event exclusive pokemon and like keeping those and like when pokemon bank came out i was like oh my god like this is what i always wanted i want to keep my pokemon from generation to generation and when my kids have pokemon i want to go like this is the scrafty that i got from pokemon worlds in 2012 like it's event specific and it was only available in this time and like now you can have it you can raise it to be yours like i want those memories and then there's the aspect of just like meeting new people like when i started my podcast almost six years ago i didn't have like i didn't really know that many people who played pokemon besides you know the people i worked with or the people or some of my close friends but like community and connecting with people is such a big thing in pokemon and i think that's not really talked about a lot like you guys are all here because you like pokemon you're listening to me talk because you like pokemon and that's really cool and there's not a lot of other games that really bring that together like i'm sure some of you right now are street passing with each other and possibly trading or battling and that's stuff that just kind of goes on um there was something i lost my trunk on uh [Music] cool great question what game features would i like to see in sun and moon uh the biggest thing is trainer customization i want that to come back i thought that was very important for me some of my my least favorite series is probably black and white and the reason i say that is because i felt like black and white focused on n the trainer it didn't focus on you and when i play pokemon game i want it to be about me it's my journey it's me going from start to finish it's me collecting these pokemon it's me raising and making connections with these pokemon and black and white black and white 2 is all about n well you know n thinks this n thinks that ended this ended then and it just didn't feel like it was my journey it felt like i was following n's journey and that's why i don't care for black and white so when they brought trainer customization to x and y and they gave me friends which was okay i kind of wish i could name my friends or like at least nicknamed my friends like in animal crossing or like an animal crossing they would be like hey french toast do you like that nickname french toast you're like no i don't they're like oh okay never mind then um i wish that stuff got brought into pokemon at least to the aspect of like let me name my friends but the trainer customization was such a big thing of like i'm different now i can wear what i want i can change my skin color i can change my hair i can change my eyes so if they can bring that back that would probably be the number one thing on my wish list i think the given of like admin pokemon i really like the rollerblade system and that was a big thing of why i didn't really like omega ruby out the sapphire is because they took away my rollerblades and they gave me the sneaking mechanic and i'm one of the most impatient players in the game so the fact that i'm slower already because i don't have roller blades and then the fact that you can make me even slower to sneak like again sneaking school but let me just like run full-blown give me my skateboard and gold and silver that's what i want right here what do you think about this one theory which came first rcs review oh man theories ah the question was what came first arceus or mu that's a tough one uh i would i my gut tells me arceus came first that would be my gut um but you know giratina he's real cool and he's the opposite kind of uh right here what are your thoughts on pokemon go pokemon go uh so actually yesterday there was a video from south by southwest that showed about 45 seconds of pokemon go footage and there was rumors and speculations that this was fake footage but it was uploaded from a couple different angles and uh i'm friends with joe from cerebe i'm sure you guys have all heard of that little little website it's a little pokemon website very small um but he usually only posts something on cerave when there's enough information to prove that it's real and he did post it and uh looking through conversations it didn't seem real it doesn't seem let me back up i didn't have very high expectations for pokemon go and the reason that i say that is because i didn't really like ingress i went through ingress is the game that niantic made before pokemon go ingress is like this it's pretty much pokemon go without pokemon or at least the central shared thought process um so i wasn't a big fan of ingress the people who like ingress really like ingress they like ingress a lot so i didn't have high expectations for pokemon go when i saw the 45 seconds which was pretty much if you watch the video it's an ivy sword and they show them going into their inventory picking a pokeball throwing the pokeball it wiggles twice ivysaur gets out because they didn't hold down b and they go okay and they go back in their inventory and they skip past the great ball and they skip past the altar ball and they go right to the master ball gotta catch that ivy sword and of course uh obviously at that point there's like zero like it's not tense anymore because the master ball is going to work unless you programmed it wrong like you did the moon ball but they catch the ivy sword and then they kind of showed the overwhelm the map and that was it and you're just like well that's all the game is it's not that exciting i i don't have a high expectations for it i think it'll still be cool i think though that you're going to get in a situation where it's like you get three free pokeballs a day and if you run out you can buy more you can buy five pokeballs from 99 cents hey you really want to catch that guard chump now you're out of pokeballs well this master ball is 4.99 and it guarantees success uh i think that's what you're going to see with pokemon go obviously they did say there's going to be micro transactions and whatnot but based off the 45 seconds i saw which is not a lot it kind of re-assured me that i probably shouldn't get so excited about this this should this is just something on the side it's just like pokemon shuffle except pokemon shuffle is really good right over there yep so pokemon you've always started out as a single trainer young kid going uh how would you like to see the main story i would love that the question was how would you like to see the main story completely changed from the you know 10 year old boy which i am going from time to time collecting eight badges i think right now you you suffer the problem of you can't make the games too hard or tricky difficult because you're always getting new pokemon trainers coming but you can't make the games well right now the games are too easy i think for all of us who have been playing for years the games are pretty easy and i was really happy with x and y like going through the first gym i was like yeah this feels good then there was that long wait before the second gym and you get there and you battle and you're like yep this feels this is what i want this you're doing it right game freak and then all of a sudden the third gym came fortune came to the fifth gym and it was just like so piled up and then at that point the game kind of became a cakewalk and i would like to see if they're gonna keep the eight gyms let every gem be ten levels gym number one you gotta be level ten gym number two you gotta be level twenty gym number three you gotta be level 30 because we're getting to that point where either fix the balance or bring down the maximum level to 50 because nothing matters after 50. you're either getting round up to a level 100 you're getting rounded down to 50. and there's yeah there's cynthia and there's some stuff there but i think that's a big that's a big like wall for me is how easy the games are and maybe there's a like beginner mode or like advanced mode before you start the new game or something i would like to see that to mix it up i mean you're not changing it drastically you're still getting the eight gyms but like don't let me just plow through everything with a blaziken like give me some challenge right here looking uh good question is kyogre a frog or a whale uh kyogre is a whale no frog there are frog pokemon like seismitoad but he's not cool if you want a cool frog you want polytote speaking of mega evolution poly toad needs a magnet evolution way in the back uh question was how do you think they made an mmorpg um i would not like that actually that's brought up at every panel i've been doing this panel for five years and i always get that question and if you asked me that five years ago even four years ago i would have said yes i want that but now i don't and the reason i say that is because i don't want to be going through my adventure and going hey battle me hey battle me like i'm already trying to avoid the trainers i don't need to avoid real-life trainers so there so i play two games a lot i play destiny a lot and i play final fantasy i don't know what those moves are for either one but i think destiny does the quote-unquote mmo really well where you see other people in the world but you don't really interact with them unless they're in your party and i think pokemon could benefit from that at least in like have a town where you could like see a bunch of people walking around and that would be really cool in a social aspect of like hey let's trade or like hey let's give items obviously you can't battle on towns but then maybe when you go into the the over world you see people but you can't really interact with them and i think that would be okay i think what pokemon's missing or what people actually want is just a world that doesn't feel empty and i think that's a good compromise where um is in like a full mmo like final fantasy 14 it's just like consistent everything happening all the time and um i don't think that would work but i think if you did like a destiny approach where it's like well you get some interaction here and you get a little bit more interaction here i think that would work really well and that's kind of what i would want to see but as for a full mmo i was like no stop asking to battle me i'm just trying to get to saffron city right here is there any particular type of weird pokemon you'd like to see like we have an ice cream cone we have a garbage bag reached rubbish is there any particular weirdo that's a good question i've never got asked that uh so we'll probably do one more question after this just because we're for the sake of time but the question was would any weird pokemon like a garbage can or a ice cream cone i would like to see and this is kind of cheating but i would like to see a woodpecker pokemon a lot of people think that in the preview for sun and moon the one pokemon they did show was a woodpecker and i never thought of it before but then i was like yeah woodpeckers are cool right yeah woodpeckers um i don't know what else as like weird pokemon [Music] i'm surprised we haven't gotten like some kind of like uh i was gonna say tv but rotom almost gets that but like some kind of like like cell phone or something because you see like cleft key with the keys and stuff so yeah i'm trying to think ice cream's real it's hard to beat ice cream it's real hard maybe like cookies all right one more right in the center yes the question was do you ever think they would add a dolphin pokemon and yeah i don't know if japan hates dolphins or that's like an animal they're they're not aware of but yeah there are i should go through and i should make a list of animals that are not pokemon obviously woodpecker would fit on this dolphin would be on the list um what was the week about a couple weeks ago oh yeah i saw that they did confirm that that was not real yeah there was a long like leak i think it was like 78 new pokemon um i don't know where it came from but the person who originally made it came out and said yeah that's not real um speaking of not real i think we're done uh so thank you guys so much for coming out i had a lot of fun [Applause] if you have any questions or you want to say hi or anything i'll be out in the hallway back there uh if you want my business card i'll have that and then also if you're not doing anything [Music] you
