thank you all for coming out on this (1:53 - 1:58)
sunday morning c2e2 like likes to stick (1:56 - 2:01)

okay uh big thanks to them for having me (2:01 - 2:05)
out this is like my fifth year here (2:03 - 2:08)
but before i go into that this is a (2:05 - 2:10)
pokemon panel so if you don't like (2:08 - 2:11)
pokemon you're probably in the wrong (2:10 - 2:13)
room (2:11 - 2:16)
and my name is sbj i am the host of a (2:13 - 2:18)
podcast called it's super effective (2:16 - 2:21)
there hey there's my logo up there and (2:18 - 2:23)
before we get into things how many of (2:21 - 2:24)
you actually listen to the podcast raise (2:23 - 2:27)
his hands (2:24 - 2:28)
hey look at that some people cool (2:27 - 2:30)
awesome well thanks for coming out if (2:28 - 2:32)
you don't listen to the podcast it's a (2:30 - 2:35)
really terrible show on itunes (2:32 - 2:37)
um has a couple thousand downloads a (2:35 - 2:40)
week but uh we do record weekly (2:37 - 2:42)
and uh you can get on itunes and (2:40 - 2:44)
stitcher and soundcloud so if you like (2:42 - 2:46)
podcasts that's that's uh something we (2:44 - 2:47)
do weekly talk about pokemon it's (2:46 - 2:50)
normally just not me i'm pretty boring (2:47 - 2:51)
so i bring in some guests from time to (2:50 - 2:53)
time (2:51 - 2:55)
so (2:53 - 2:59)
let's start (2:55 - 2:59)
hey there we go so i never know what to (2:59 - 3:03)
talk about at these panels (3:01 - 3:05)
because as we saw from the raise of (3:03 - 3:07)
hands uh some of you don't listen to my (3:05 - 3:10)
show so i try to be general try to be (3:07 - 3:12)
specific not specific (3:10 - 3:14)
so i can at least appeal to everyone (3:12 - 3:15)
here and hopefully not waste your next (3:14 - 3:17)
hour (3:15 - 3:19)
yeah so with that being said we're gonna (3:17 - 3:21)
i'm gonna go through the 20 years of (3:19 - 3:23)
pokemon and try to give you a recap and (3:21 - 3:24)
hopefully blow your mind with some stuff (3:23 - 3:27)
you might not know about pokemon uh if i (3:24 - 3:29)
get some things wrong i'm sorry i tried (3:27 - 3:32)
my best last night until 4am to get (3:29 - 3:34)
something worthwhile for you guys (3:32 - 3:35)
so we're gonna go through the 20 years (3:34 - 3:37)
and then five time which will probably (3:35 - 3:39)
happen because i blow through content (3:37 - 3:41)
pretty fast uh we can do a q a at the (3:39 - 3:44)
end and you guys can answer ques ask (3:41 - 3:45)
questions and i will answer them to the (3:44 - 3:46)
best of my ability (3:45 - 3:48)
that's usually my favorite part and (3:46 - 3:49)
that's (3:48 - 3:50)
the last couple years that's what we (3:49 - 3:52)
ended up doing for the majority of the (3:50 - 3:54)
time (3:52 - 3:55)
so (3:54 - 3:57)
this will be about the 20 years of (3:55 - 4:00)
pokemon (3:57 - 4:00)
we know nothing about pokemon sun and (4:00 - 4:03)
moon so i will touch on that in a little (4:01 - 4:04)
bit but (4:03 - 4:06)
just so you know like everything from (4:04 - 4:09)
there speculation (4:06 - 4:12)
all right let's start (4:09 - 4:13)
awesome (4:12 - 4:16)
so i'm going to remind myself that (4:13 - 4:19)
february 27 1996 is the japanese date of (4:16 - 4:23)
when pokemon red and green came out (4:19 - 4:25)
in japan of course and then september (4:23 - 4:27)
28th is when it came to north america (4:25 - 4:29)
later on the slide's gonna flip the (4:27 - 4:31)
north american date and the japanese day (4:29 - 4:32)
because it's not as relevant as it is (4:31 - 4:34)
from here now obviously pokemon just (4:32 - 4:36)
celebrated its 20th anniversary on (4:34 - 4:38)
february 27th that was (4:36 - 4:40)
uh pokemon day where you could get cards (4:38 - 4:44)
from toys r us and and the virtual (4:40 - 4:46)
console games for red blue and yellow (4:44 - 4:48)
were available in the eshop (4:46 - 4:49)
so maybe some things you don't know (4:48 - 4:51)
about pokemon red and blue (4:49 - 4:54)
it received a 10 out of 10 from ign it (4:51 - 4:56)
was called the masterpiece (4:54 - 4:58)
jigglypuff and wigglytuff's name so in (4:56 - 5:00)
early in development i thought this was (4:58 - 5:03)
uh somewhat of a fun fact (5:00 - 5:04)
they were originally supposed to be (5:03 - 5:08)
named pudding and custard (5:04 - 5:10)
before their names were changed to (5:08 - 5:12)
jigglypuff and wigglytuff there were a (5:10 - 5:15)
bunch of other names that were changed (5:12 - 5:16)
prior the only other one that i thought (5:15 - 5:18)
was kind of funny it was a vulpix was (5:16 - 5:21)
supposed to be named foxfire (5:18 - 5:24)
not to get confused with firefox (5:21 - 5:26)
all right so they originally wanted to (5:24 - 5:29)
have the re to the ability to rebattle (5:26 - 5:31)
any trainer throughout the game that was (5:29 - 5:33)
cut last minute due to time that was (5:31 - 5:34)
something that was then introduced i (5:33 - 5:36)
believe in (5:34 - 5:38)
gold and silver (5:36 - 5:40)
you guys know more than i do (5:38 - 5:42)
uh there was also supposed to be a (5:40 - 5:43)
female trainer playable but that was (5:42 - 5:45)
also cut we didn't see that until (5:43 - 5:48)
crystal if i'm not mistaken (5:45 - 5:50)
and then what else do we have here (5:48 - 5:53)
lance's dragonite nose barrier it's uh (5:50 - 5:54)
dragonite can't actually learn barrier (5:53 - 5:58)
at all uh i believe a couple months ago (5:54 - 6:00)
maybe even a year ago lance's dragonite (5:58 - 6:03)
was given away as a gift from (6:00 - 6:05)
digital download and it did no barrier (6:03 - 6:08)
then (6:05 - 6:10)
what else do we have here (6:08 - 6:11)
some stuff you can't see on the screen (6:10 - 6:12)
because i only had room for so many (6:11 - 6:15)
bullet points (6:12 - 6:17)
drowsy sprite has five fingers in red (6:15 - 6:18)
and blue it's actually supposed to only (6:17 - 6:20)
have three (6:18 - 6:23)
some pokemon share the same cries (6:20 - 6:25)
back in red and blue the original exam (6:23 - 6:27)
some examples are charizard and rye horn (6:25 - 6:29)
have the same cry (6:27 - 6:32)
ditto and poliwag share the same cry and (6:29 - 6:34)
goldeen and caterpie have the same exact (6:32 - 6:36)
cry so if you're going through a virtual (6:34 - 6:38)
console right now (6:36 - 6:39)
playing red and blue getting your (6:38 - 6:41)
pokemon ready for (6:39 - 6:43)
sun and moon (6:41 - 6:46)
that's something you can notice (6:43 - 6:49)
also finally to round out (6:46 - 6:52)
red and blue here is hi i like shorts (6:49 - 6:56)
they're comfy and easy to wear (6:52 - 6:56)
was a very popular meme that came from (6:56 - 7:00)
red and blue it was referenced again in (6:58 - 7:03)
pokemon black and white 2 (7:00 - 7:07)
where another trainer does say that (7:03 - 7:09)
all right gold and silver now reminding (7:07 - 7:11)
myself that the (7:09 - 7:13)
north american date is now on top and (7:11 - 7:16)
the japanese date is on the bottom here (7:13 - 7:18)
so we have (7:16 - 7:22)
almost a three year difference between (7:18 - 7:24)
uh when red and blue came out and gold (7:22 - 7:26)
and silver (7:24 - 7:26)
so gold silver added 100 new pokemon (7:26 - 7:32)
brought it up to 251 (7:29 - 7:34)
battle music (7:32 - 7:35)
is different during the day at night (7:34 - 7:37)
these are the only games where the (7:35 - 7:38)
battle music is different between day (7:37 - 7:40)
and night obviously in some games they (7:38 - 7:42)
got rid of the day and night cycle but (7:40 - 7:44)
when you're battling gold silver the (7:42 - 7:46)
music is slightly different depending on (7:44 - 7:48)
what time of day it is (7:46 - 7:51)
moon balls never worked (7:48 - 7:52)
still don't (7:51 - 7:53)
don't know if they could release it on (7:52 - 7:56)
virtual console they will fix it (7:53 - 7:57)
moon balls don't work as they were (7:56 - 7:59)
planned they were supposed to increase (7:57 - 8:00)
the catch rate times four when trying to (7:59 - 8:02)
catch pokemon that involves using a (8:00 - 8:04)
moonstone so your jigglypuff or your (8:02 - 8:07)
clefairy instead they were programmed to (8:04 - 8:09)
increase the catch rate when you try to (8:07 - 8:12)
catch a pokemon that uses a burn heel (8:09 - 8:12)
which (8:12 - 8:14)
of course will never happen because a (8:12 - 8:16)
wild pokemon will never use burn heal on (8:14 - 8:18)
itself (8:16 - 8:18)
skateboarding was a form of (8:20 - 8:24)
transportation that was in gold and (8:22 - 8:25)
silver that they ended up cutting and (8:24 - 8:27)
they just left with the bicycle and if (8:25 - 8:29)
we saw an x and y they went with some (8:27 - 8:31)
roller blades which which i was a big (8:29 - 8:33)
fan of but uh it would kind of be cool (8:31 - 8:36)
to have a skateboard i guess in like the (8:33 - 8:37)
early 2000s skateboarding was real big (8:36 - 8:40)
like tony hawk pro skater 2 was a real (8:37 - 8:42)
big fad (8:40 - 8:43)
there's a lot of glitches in gold and (8:42 - 8:45)
silver (8:43 - 8:45)
due to a glitch in the game's code burn (8:46 - 8:50)
paralysis and poison status don't affect (8:48 - 8:52)
the catch rate of a pokemon (8:50 - 8:55)
so paralyzing or poisoning a pokemon (8:52 - 8:56)
does not increase the catch rate when (8:55 - 8:58)
it's supposed to (8:56 - 9:00)
uh steel and dark these two types were (8:58 - 9:02)
introduced to balance out psychic in the (9:00 - 9:04)
game because uh psychic was too powerful (9:02 - 9:06)
and at the time psychic was only weak (9:04 - 9:07)
against bug (9:06 - 9:09)
so that's why uh steel and dark type was (9:07 - 9:11)
added and (9:09 - 9:13)
those were the (9:11 - 9:16)
two newest types until we got ferry (9:13 - 9:18)
and then the gym in goldenrod city is (9:16 - 9:20)
laid out like the shape of a clefairy i (9:18 - 9:22)
don't have a picture of that but if you (9:20 - 9:24)
go through and you look at how the (9:22 - 9:25)
flowers are arranged in that gym it (9:24 - 9:27)
actually makes out to be a clefairy and (9:25 - 9:28)
i could probably talk about how (9:27 - 9:32)
whitney's melt tank is the worst (9:28 - 9:32)
but you guys probably all know that (9:32 - 9:37)
all right march 19 2003 is when ruby and (9:38 - 9:46)
sapphire came out november 21st in japan (9:42 - 9:48)
japan loves their uh (9:46 - 9:52)
november release dates for pokemon (9:48 - 9:53)
uh (9:52 - 9:55)
ruby and sapphire added a lot they also (9:53 - 9:56)
removed a lot uh (9:55 - 9:57)
one of the big things that kind of (9:56 - 9:59)
bothered me is you can no longer name (9:57 - 10:02)
your rival (9:59 - 10:02)
which was a bit of a bummer (10:02 - 10:06)
uh (10:05 - 10:08)
ruby and sapphire is the only main (10:06 - 10:10)
series game where you actually meet your (10:08 - 10:11)
father (10:10 - 10:14)
[Music] (10:11 - 10:14)
very hard times in the pokemon world (10:15 - 10:20)
ruby and sapphire introduced pokemon (10:21 - 10:25)
abilities (10:24 - 10:27)
and it also introduced (10:25 - 10:30)
battles of double battles (10:27 - 10:32)
on top of that it introduced natures as (10:30 - 10:34)
well as stat changes regarding evs and (10:32 - 10:39)
ivs and it also added pokemon contests (10:34 - 10:40)
so these were the first games on the (10:39 - 10:42)
gameboy advance these games also cut off (10:40 - 10:45)
compatibility between red and blue and (10:42 - 10:47)
gold and silver you can no longer trade (10:45 - 10:49)
that's why in the future we get (10:47 - 10:53)
uh fire red and leaf green (10:49 - 10:54)
if you're keeping count of the amount of (10:53 - 10:56)
pokemon added (10:54 - 11:00)
ruby and sapphire added 135 new pokemon (10:56 - 11:03)
they also added a bunch of pokeballs so (11:00 - 11:04)
my favorite pokeball is the premiere (11:03 - 11:06)
ball which is that white ball with the (11:04 - 11:08)
red ring around it ah that was added (11:06 - 11:10)
ruby and sapphire it just looks fancy it (11:08 - 11:13)
doesn't really do anything (11:10 - 11:15)
it looks sweet though the repeat ball (11:13 - 11:17)
was added which makes easy it makes it (11:15 - 11:18)
easier to catch pokemon that were (11:17 - 11:21)
already caught the timer ball was added (11:18 - 11:24)
which uh if you're struggling in a very (11:21 - 11:25)
long battle the timer ball makes that (11:24 - 11:26)
easy (11:25 - 11:28)
the nest ball was it you see a theme (11:26 - 11:30)
here the nest ball was added which makes (11:28 - 11:32)
lower level pokemon easier to catch the (11:30 - 11:36)
net ball was added to catch the internet (11:32 - 11:38)
no i mean uh it's against water pokemon (11:36 - 11:40)
and bug pokemon (11:38 - 11:42)
dive ball was added to catch siege wally (11:40 - 11:45)
pokemon and the luxury ball was added (11:42 - 11:46)
to (11:45 - 11:48)
make the capture of pokemon more (11:46 - 11:49)
comfortable and friendly with its (11:48 - 11:51)
trainers (11:49 - 11:52)
so (11:51 - 11:57)
ruby and sapphire went balls crazy (11:52 - 11:57)
on april 22nd 2007. (11:58 - 12:03)
got some diamond that's because all the (12:03 - 12:07)
hoenn fans are satisfied now so now we (12:05 - 12:09)
can get excited for diamond referral (12:07 - 12:11)
here uh (12:09 - 12:14)
introduced april 22nd september 28th in (12:11 - 12:16)
japan (12:14 - 12:17)
these were games that actually got me (12:16 - 12:19)
back into pokemon i stepped away from (12:17 - 12:22)
pokemon during gem 3. that was the time (12:19 - 12:24)
when i was in middle school and gosh (12:22 - 12:26)
forbid you talk about pokemon to get (12:24 - 12:28)
made fun of (12:26 - 12:30)
but i was in high school when pokemon (12:28 - 12:32)
was cool again (12:30 - 12:34)
and so everyone jumped on the diamond (12:32 - 12:36)
pro bandwagon some of my favorite games (12:34 - 12:38)
so this is the first game where the (12:36 - 12:40)
pokemon lab your professor is not (12:38 - 12:43)
actually located in your hometown (12:40 - 12:44)
it's also the first pokemon game that (12:43 - 12:48)
added wi-fi uh with like the gts trading (12:44 - 12:50)
battling it also added voice chat as (12:48 - 12:51)
well so i think a lot of people forget (12:50 - 12:53)
that i think (12:51 - 12:54)
you know we've been playing pokemon for (12:53 - 12:57)
20 years that we just take what we have (12:54 - 12:58)
given (12:57 - 13:00)
but it was actually only (12:58 - 13:02)
uh less than 10 years ago we we finally (13:00 - 13:05)
got wi-fi and everything (13:02 - 13:06)
route 218 i'm like trying to think of (13:05 - 13:08)
why i wrote that down (13:06 - 13:11)
um so within route 218 inside one of the (13:08 - 13:13)
hallway type buildings there is a guard (13:11 - 13:15)
who will tell you how thirsty he is (13:13 - 13:17)
however bringing him a drink won't do (13:15 - 13:18)
anything (13:17 - 13:19)
but this is a reference to the original (13:18 - 13:21)
games in red blue green and yellow in (13:19 - 13:23)
which a player must bring a drink to the (13:21 - 13:27)
guard in saffron city to pass (13:23 - 13:28)
i suppose i could have a presentation (13:27 - 13:31)
about how all the games reference each (13:28 - 13:33)
other in some way but picked out a (13:31 - 13:36)
couple if you're keeping track 107 new (13:33 - 13:39)
pokemon were added in diamond and pearl (13:36 - 13:41)
a new battle system was used in diamond (13:39 - 13:43)
and pearl this battle system separated (13:41 - 13:46)
attacks from physical and special (13:43 - 13:48)
so if an enemy is (13:46 - 13:49)
actually touched when attacked it's (13:48 - 13:52)
considered physical if it's not it's (13:49 - 13:52)
considered (13:52 - 13:55)
special you guys probably all know that (13:52 - 13:56)
but (13:55 - 13:58)
this was considered pretty controversial (13:56 - 14:00)
at the time (13:58 - 14:02)
because you know anytime you change (14:00 - 14:03)
somebody's pokemon game they're going to (14:02 - 14:05)
freak out (14:03 - 14:07)
and people did freak out but then it's (14:05 - 14:09)
it was fine (14:07 - 14:12)
everything is always fine (14:09 - 14:16)
black and white all right march 6 2011. (14:12 - 14:17)
that's when we got black and white with (14:16 - 14:20)
156 new pokemon (14:17 - 14:22)
today (14:20 - 14:24)
uh you noticed that i'm only doing main (14:22 - 14:26)
series games (14:24 - 14:28)
uh but i do want to point out that (14:26 - 14:29)
between every main series game that's (14:28 - 14:31)
been three to four years that's why it (14:29 - 14:32)
makes so much sense that we're getting (14:31 - 14:34)
sun and moon this year and not like a (14:32 - 14:36)
pokemon z or anything because it has (14:34 - 14:37)
been (14:36 - 14:39)
three full years which is (14:37 - 14:40)
the (14:39 - 14:42)
apparently the pokemon trigger for (14:40 - 14:45)
must-have new game (14:42 - 14:47)
the sword of justice pokemon does anyone (14:45 - 14:50)
know who those are (14:47 - 14:50)
uh (14:50 - 14:54)
[Music] (14:51 - 14:54)
so some of you guys said it right it's (14:55 - 15:00)
kabalye tarakian parisian and keldeo (14:57 - 15:01)
those are the sword of justice there's a (15:00 - 15:05)
movie about it that's very bad (15:01 - 15:05)
but they are actually based on the three (15:06 - 15:09)
musketeers (15:08 - 15:11)
i'm going to slaughter some names here (15:09 - 15:14)
but kubali and taraki and varision are (15:11 - 15:15)
based on (15:14 - 15:18)
atheos porthos and (15:15 - 15:20)
armis armies (15:18 - 15:21)
hermes there we go that's why you guys (15:20 - 15:24)
are here (15:21 - 15:25)
now you're thinking three musketeers (15:24 - 15:28)
what what about good old keldeo (15:25 - 15:30)
kelly was the youngest (15:28 - 15:32)
muskie tear based on (15:30 - 15:34)
d-arc (15:32 - 15:37)
there you guys go i should just replace (15:34 - 15:38)
you with me (15:37 - 15:41)
this would go way smoother (15:38 - 15:43)
callestia city floor 22 does anyone know (15:41 - 15:45)
what's there (15:43 - 15:45)
oh see if we got what like we got like (15:46 - 15:50)
two people who got it uh no curium is (15:47 - 15:52)
not on 422. (15:50 - 15:53)
um (15:52 - 15:54)
game three has its own building because (15:53 - 15:57)
castalia city they appear on the the (15:54 - 15:59)
22nd floor which is the same floor of (15:57 - 16:01)
their real-life office tower which is (15:59 - 16:04)
the carrot tower in tokyo japan (16:01 - 16:05)
so yeah (16:04 - 16:07)
did i blow anyone's mind there (16:05 - 16:09)
slightly (16:07 - 16:12)
uh there was a lot of dsi specific (16:09 - 16:14)
features i'll get back to the tms in a (16:12 - 16:16)
second so the reason i put the dsi (16:14 - 16:18)
features is because we have the new (16:16 - 16:21)
three the new 3ds not to be confused (16:18 - 16:23)
with the non-new 3ds (16:21 - 16:25)
and so black and white did take (16:23 - 16:27)
advantage of the dsi (16:25 - 16:30)
so again just speculating that i would i (16:27 - 16:31)
would hope (16:30 - 16:33)
and assume that sun and moon take (16:31 - 16:37)
advantages of the new 3ds but still work (16:33 - 16:39)
on the original 3ds just like black and (16:37 - 16:41)
white did but some of the specific (16:39 - 16:43)
features are (16:41 - 16:45)
the games can connect to routers with a (16:43 - 16:47)
wpa connection that's just technical but (16:45 - 16:48)
that was a feature (16:47 - 16:50)
a camera can be used during x (16:48 - 16:52)
transceiver (16:50 - 16:53)
uh communications with other players the (16:52 - 16:56)
c gear shows the system power using (16:53 - 16:58)
three battery bars instead of two (16:56 - 17:01)
very fancy there and on the home screen (16:58 - 17:02)
the handheld console the little pokeball (17:01 - 17:04)
will actually wiggle instead of not (17:02 - 17:07)
moving it off so very minor features (17:04 - 17:10)
that the dsi had but (17:07 - 17:12)
the game freak did put into (17:10 - 17:15)
some consideration if you were using the (17:12 - 17:17)
new hardware (17:15 - 17:20)
and finally tms have infinite use no (17:17 - 17:22)
longer do you have to go to the fourth (17:20 - 17:24)
floor of the pokemark (17:22 - 17:26)
in saladon city and buy a bunch of tms (17:24 - 17:30)
over and over by your ice beam (17:26 - 17:30)
tmz have infinite use which was a big (17:30 - 17:34)
welcoming change i think to black and (17:32 - 17:36)
white (17:34 - 17:36)
all right i like how you guys cheer for (17:37 - 17:40)
games it's exciting (17:38 - 17:42)
we have more games after this spoiler (17:40 - 17:46)
all right so on october 12 2013 our (17:42 - 17:48)
first worldwide release (17:46 - 17:50)
of pokemon x and pokemon y (17:48 - 17:53)
72 new pokemon this is the smallest (17:50 - 17:55)
amount of pokemon they added to a new (17:53 - 17:57)
main series game just keep that in mind (17:55 - 17:59)
for sun and moon (17:57 - 18:02)
uh they did add fairy types (17:59 - 18:02)
[Music] (18:03 - 18:12)
political debate in here about fairy (18:10 - 18:12)
type (18:12 - 18:14)
uh (18:12 - 18:16)
this type was added to balance out (18:14 - 18:18)
dragon (18:16 - 18:21)
which was dragon was only weak to dragon (18:18 - 18:23)
and ice so fairy type was added to (18:21 - 18:25)
balance that out fair attacks if you did (18:23 - 18:27)
not know are strong against dragon (18:25 - 18:30)
fighting and dark types they resist fire (18:27 - 18:32)
poisoned steel (18:30 - 18:34)
ferry are only weak to poison and steal (18:32 - 18:36)
they resist fighting bug dark and they (18:34 - 18:40)
are immune to dragon attacks (18:36 - 18:40)
x and y is when we got mega evolutions (18:40 - 18:44)
which was pokemon's cop-out of not (18:42 - 18:46)
giving us a fourth evolution (18:44 - 18:48)
and increasing the pokedex even more but (18:46 - 18:49)
i'm actually very happy with mega (18:48 - 18:51)
evolutions i like how it doesn't bog (18:49 - 18:53)
down the pokedex and i like (18:51 - 18:55)
that it makes (18:53 - 18:58)
pokemon like charizard actually bearable (18:55 - 19:01)
i'm just kidding charizard's cool (18:58 - 19:04)
lucario not so much (19:01 - 19:04)
if you visit the pokemon center on your (19:09 - 19:13)
birthday you do get a special birthday (19:11 - 19:14)
wish i don't know if any of you guys (19:13 - 19:17)
knew that but that's a little fun fact (19:14 - 19:20)
this is the first pokemon game in 3d (19:17 - 19:21)
prior to that we had sprites and (19:20 - 19:24)
everything so that was a very major (19:21 - 19:26)
change to the series it was also the (19:24 - 19:27)
first game because of worldwide release (19:26 - 19:29)
it was available in seven different (19:27 - 19:30)
languages which you can pick at the (19:29 - 19:33)
beginning if you wanted to hone your (19:30 - 19:35)
italian right off the bat (19:33 - 19:38)
you can do so (19:35 - 19:40)
according to masuda who is uh in charge (19:38 - 19:43)
of the pokemon the pokeman on november (19:40 - 19:44)
18th (19:43 - 19:46)
he stated that when x and y was in (19:44 - 19:48)
development it had over 500 people (19:46 - 19:51)
working on it including localization and (19:48 - 19:55)
it took 3.5 years to make (19:51 - 19:56)
and (19:55 - 19:59)
pokemon x and y ended the ever so (19:56 - 20:01)
popular sky battles (19:59 - 20:03)
that was sarcasm (20:01 - 20:05)
but horde battles i think are still (20:03 - 20:07)
pretty popular especially for your eb (20:05 - 20:09)
and your iv training (20:07 - 20:12)
and uh it added pokemon to me it added (20:09 - 20:14)
the pss the player search system (20:12 - 20:16)
and it added (20:14 - 20:19)
super training (20:16 - 20:19)
[Applause] (20:19 - 20:24)
so i do have some information about (20:24 - 20:30)
sunday news sunday sun and moon (20:26 - 20:32)
sun and news (20:30 - 20:34)
all right breaking information (20:32 - 20:37)
these games are compatible with pokemon (20:34 - 20:38)
bank (20:37 - 20:41)
let's see what's your first fact (20:38 - 20:43)
uh specifically they are compatible with (20:41 - 20:45)
the uh red blue and yellow virtual (20:43 - 20:46)
console games (20:45 - 20:48)
we don't have a way to move those (20:46 - 20:50)
pokemon to (20:48 - 20:52)
uh any game but they will only move to (20:50 - 20:54)
sun and moon they won't move to x and y (20:52 - 20:56)
according to pokemon's website these are (20:54 - 20:58)
also going to be the first pokemon games (20:56 - 21:01)
released in chinese (20:58 - 21:02)
which is just very popular because china (21:01 - 21:06)
is a big land mass (21:02 - 21:08)
and it was stated that this will be a (21:06 - 21:11)
worldwide release again (21:08 - 21:14)
all right that's pretty much all i have (21:11 - 21:17)
for the main series games so based on oh (21:14 - 21:19)
i have all right more (21:17 - 21:22)
uh so based on what we saw (21:19 - 21:24)
the lowest amount of pokemon new pokemon (21:22 - 21:26)
we got was uh (21:24 - 21:30)
76 and the highest we got was 150 so (21:26 - 21:31)
pick a number between there i'm assuming (21:30 - 21:33)
that's how many new pokemon we're gonna (21:31 - 21:34)
get (21:33 - 21:36)
um (21:34 - 21:37)
and (21:36 - 21:38)
i don't know if it's based off the (21:37 - 21:40)
current engine but it's been in (21:38 - 21:42)
development for three years (21:40 - 21:45)
at least to our knowledge and that there (21:42 - 21:47)
was no pokemon game last year so i would (21:45 - 21:49)
assume that this will be drastically (21:47 - 21:51)
different but (21:49 - 21:53)
uh they're supposed to be supposedly a (21:51 - 21:55)
coracora (21:53 - 21:56)
core car is a magazine that comes out in (21:55 - 21:57)
japan (21:56 - 21:59)
and it's supposed to come out i think in (21:57 - 22:00)
two to three weeks and there will (21:59 - 22:03)
suppose supposedly be new information (22:00 - 22:05)
regarding summit moon there (22:03 - 22:06)
so but we got (22:05 - 22:08)
plenty of time for that (22:06 - 22:10)
so instead of looking into the future (22:08 - 22:13)
with sun and moon let's go into the past (22:10 - 22:15)
and look at all the pokemon (22:13 - 22:18)
spin-off games (22:15 - 22:18)
some (22:21 - 22:26)
some being good some being bad (22:22 - 22:26)
so (22:29 - 22:32)
let's (22:30 - 22:35)
man i feel like pokemon snap is like you (22:32 - 22:36)
shouldn't bring it up because people (22:35 - 22:37)
just freak out (22:36 - 22:39)
how good it (22:37 - 22:41)
is (22:39 - 22:44)
so pokemon snap actually only had 63 of (22:41 - 22:47)
the 151 pokemon appear in it (22:44 - 22:48)
uh (22:47 - 22:50)
it was rumored that there was supposed (22:48 - 22:52)
to be 64 pokemon because it is the (22:50 - 22:55)
nintendo 64. uh (22:52 - 22:57)
and there was actual screenshots of (22:55 - 22:59)
ekans being take uh having pictures (22:57 - 23:01)
taken of it but atkins does not actually (22:59 - 23:02)
appear in the game which is kind of why (23:01 - 23:04)
it makes sense that there's 63 because (23:02 - 23:07)
if there was accident atkins we would be (23:04 - 23:09)
at the right number for the fad that was (23:07 - 23:11)
64. (23:09 - 23:13)
and then pokemon pinball very popular (23:11 - 23:15)
game boy color game (23:13 - 23:17)
at least to me it's the only pinball (23:15 - 23:19)
game i actually kind of liked (23:17 - 23:20)
uh (23:19 - 23:23)
fun fact about that is miu can appear (23:20 - 23:24)
at the end of the game as a catchable (23:23 - 23:26)
pokemon but you can't actually catch it (23:24 - 23:28)
because of the limitation of the ram (23:26 - 23:31)
inside a gameboy cartridge (23:28 - 23:33)
it would require you to hit mu over a (23:31 - 23:35)
thousand times in two minutes in order (23:33 - 23:37)
to catch it which was never possible but (23:35 - 23:39)
if you did encounter mew you did unlock (23:37 - 23:43)
its pokedex entry so i think they knew (23:39 - 23:43)
that (23:43 - 23:46)
they messed up (23:43 - 23:50)
yeah more spin-offs (23:46 - 23:50)
all right so we have the pokemon (23:52 - 23:56)
training card game uh (23:54 - 23:58)
which i remember getting on easter (23:56 - 24:00)
i was so excited it was the best easter (23:58 - 24:02)
ever had the easter bunny was very good (24:00 - 24:04)
to me that year when i was a kid in (24:02 - 24:06)
pokemon stadium (24:04 - 24:08)
as well which was very popular (24:06 - 24:10)
um (24:08 - 24:11)
so (24:10 - 24:12)
making i feel like i'm going a little (24:11 - 24:14)
fast so i could tell this (24:12 - 24:16)
wrestling story i have about pokemon (24:14 - 24:18)
stadium you guys are thinking wrestling (24:16 - 24:20)
right (24:18 - 24:22)
but i'll tell him because i think it's (24:20 - 24:23)
okay i think it's kind of a good story (24:22 - 24:25)
i've never told in my podcast so you (24:23 - 24:27)
guys are first to hear it it's (24:25 - 24:29)
maybe it's not that good i don't know (24:27 - 24:30)
so bear with me here until i get to the (24:29 - 24:34)
pokemon part of it so i was in sixth (24:30 - 24:37)
grade when pokemon stadium came out (24:34 - 24:38)
and i was (24:37 - 24:41)
livid i was so excited to get it (24:38 - 24:43)
but also in sixth grade i was a i came (24:41 - 24:45)
upon (24:43 - 24:47)
wwe and i thought man this is the (24:45 - 24:50)
coolest show sixth grade it's like 11 (24:47 - 24:52)
years old watching wwe (24:50 - 24:56)
every night it was on with my parents (24:52 - 24:59)
and uh so in sixth grade of course (24:56 - 25:01)
you know you're in a new environment you (24:59 - 25:03)
want to try to be active trying to make (25:01 - 25:05)
new friends so pokemon was already very (25:03 - 25:07)
vague and secure i had that covered had (25:05 - 25:10)
all my pokemon friends we were good (25:07 - 25:11)
but (25:10 - 25:13)
i like wwe so much (25:11 - 25:14)
looking at all the sports and i'm not (25:13 - 25:16)
athletic at all (25:14 - 25:19)
and i'm like wrestling i love wwe i want (25:16 - 25:21)
to be a wrestler and my parents were (25:19 - 25:23)
like you know it's not the same (25:21 - 25:25)
and i said no mom i want to be a (25:23 - 25:27)
wrestler they're so they have cool (25:25 - 25:29)
entrances they have (25:27 - 25:31)
hi bro (25:29 - 25:33)
they're so cool mom (25:31 - 25:35)
so they were like okay (25:33 - 25:37)
put you into wrestling (25:35 - 25:38)
so (25:37 - 25:40)
i don't know if you guys know what it's (25:38 - 25:42)
like to have a coach yelling at you on (25:40 - 25:44)
the sideline but then to also have your (25:42 - 25:47)
dad yelling at you at the sideline to do (25:44 - 25:49)
stuff during a wrestling match which is (25:47 - 25:50)
not fun (25:49 - 25:52)
i hated wrestling (25:50 - 25:53)
my parents were right it was nothing (25:52 - 25:56)
like i wanted i'm not athletic i didn't (25:53 - 25:58)
have the anger to tackle another guy i (25:56 - 26:00)
just thought that (25:58 - 26:02)
i'd wear a cool outfit and have pyro one (26:00 - 26:04)
day (26:02 - 26:04)
it was a terrible experience so i went (26:05 - 26:08)
to every wrestling meet i went to every (26:06 - 26:11)
wrestling school event i went to every (26:08 - 26:14)
night of training just hating it (26:11 - 26:15)
absolutely hating it (26:14 - 26:18)
and i didn't win a single match (26:15 - 26:20)
probably did 30 or 40 matches in my (26:18 - 26:21)
weight class i think i was like 99 (26:20 - 26:24)
pounds back then i was 11 years old (26:21 - 26:26)
so it was very very rare if i even got (26:24 - 26:28)
somebody that matched my weight that (26:26 - 26:30)
wasn't like (26:28 - 26:32)
seven years old and could easily take me (26:30 - 26:33)
out (26:32 - 26:35)
me being 11. (26:33 - 26:38)
so finally after going to all these (26:35 - 26:40)
events i finally win my first match and (26:38 - 26:41)
i barely won it (26:40 - 26:43)
and the entire time (26:41 - 26:45)
coach is yelling at me my dad is yelling (26:43 - 26:46)
at me (26:45 - 26:48)
grab his leg don't grab his leg go from (26:46 - 26:51)
behind don't go from behind (26:48 - 26:53)
and i won and instead of my dad being (26:51 - 26:56)
proud he told me that i was lucky that i (26:53 - 26:58)
barely won (26:56 - 27:01)
because i made so many mistakes (26:58 - 27:01)
my dad's not a nice person (27:01 - 27:06)
so (27:04 - 27:08)

three count one two three again really (28:03 - 28:06)

real wrestling school wrestling it's (28:11 - 28:16)

they partnered me up with the person in (28:20 - 28:23)
my weight class (28:21 - 28:25)
feeling really good i have to win this (28:23 - 28:29)
there's pokemon stadium on the line (28:25 - 28:31)
and we we start the wrestling match (28:29 - 28:34)
and i'm winning i'm you get points in (28:31 - 28:35)
wrestling if you like tackle their leg (28:34 - 28:37)
or you get behind them you get points so (28:35 - 28:39)
you can win two ways you get either (28:37 - 28:41)
enough points time limit runs up or you (28:39 - 28:43)
pin the person i've never pinned anyone (28:41 - 28:45)
i lost a lot (28:43 - 28:47)
so i'm winning i'm winning i'm going (28:45 - 28:48)
through (28:47 - 28:50)
round after round i'm in the lead i'm in (28:48 - 28:52)
the lead i'm doing it (28:50 - 28:54)
we're in the last round (28:52 - 28:56)
i have three points ahead even if he got (28:54 - 28:58)
behind me and got an extra point (28:56 - 29:01)
i was so good i was golden (28:58 - 29:03)
and something happened (29:01 - 29:05)
and i can't remember when so fast and (29:03 - 29:08)
all of a sudden i was pinned (29:05 - 29:10)
and i lost with (29:08 - 29:13)
20 seconds left in the match to go all i (29:10 - 29:15)
needed to do was wait 20 more seconds (29:13 - 29:16)
and i would have had (29:15 - 29:18)
pokemon so you guys thought this was (29:16 - 29:19)
going to be a heavy ending it wasn't i (29:18 - 29:21)
lost (29:19 - 29:24)
and i lost my chance at pokemon stadium (29:21 - 29:26)
and that was my story (29:24 - 29:28)
uh i did end up getting pokemon stadium (29:26 - 29:30)
for my birthday and i absolutely loved (29:28 - 29:31)
it (29:30 - 29:32)
but (29:31 - 29:34)
pope my name will always have a place in (29:32 - 29:35)
my heart for (29:34 - 29:37)
reminding me that (29:35 - 29:39)
i absolutely hated anything (29:37 - 29:42)
athletic especially wrestling (29:39 - 29:44)
and that (29:42 - 29:46)
i know one day when i have kids (29:44 - 29:48)
i will use pokemon to drive them to do (29:46 - 29:50)
great things (29:48 - 29:50)
[Music] (29:51 - 29:54)
all right (29:52 - 29:55)
one of these games is my favorite it's (29:54 - 29:59)
not hey you pikachu (29:55 - 29:59)
i was a very big fan of pokemon puzzling (30:01 - 30:05)
still i'm a very big fan of pokemon (30:03 - 30:07)
puzzle league i don't have any real fun (30:05 - 30:08)
facts about these games pokemon puzzle (30:07 - 30:10)
league is the only pokemon game from (30:08 - 30:12)
last time i checked which was not (30:10 - 30:14)
released in japan (30:12 - 30:15)
that was a fun fact i showed last year (30:14 - 30:17)
uh pokemon p i hate pikachu's just (30:15 - 30:19)
garbage so (30:17 - 30:23)
that's your fun fact there (30:19 - 30:23)
all right we got more spin-off titles so (30:24 - 30:29)
we're in 2003 we got pokemon channel (30:26 - 30:30)
which if you thought hey you pikachu is (30:29 - 30:31)
bad (30:30 - 30:33)
we're going down (30:31 - 30:35)
and we got pokemon pinball ruby and (30:33 - 30:37)
sapphire which is actually also a very (30:35 - 30:39)
good pinball game (30:37 - 30:40)
i (30:39 - 30:42)
built an arcade cabinet with my friend (30:40 - 30:43)
aaron (30:42 - 30:46)
and we put a gamecube in it and we put a (30:43 - 30:48)
gameboy player in it and so the arcade (30:46 - 30:49)
cabinet has like paddles on the side and (30:48 - 30:52)
has face buttons so we pretty much built (30:49 - 30:55)
a pokemon pinball machine uh which i (30:52 - 30:57)
bring to the midwestern classic which is (30:55 - 31:00)
in brookville wisconsin every year (30:57 - 31:02)
so it's kind of cool (31:00 - 31:07)
it exists it's something i kind of built (31:02 - 31:10)
more spin-offs since from 2004 to 2005 (31:07 - 31:12)
we have pokemon dash the only pokemon (31:10 - 31:14)
racing game which doesn't say much (31:12 - 31:16)
because it wasn't very good (31:14 - 31:20)
and we have pokemon coliseum as well (31:16 - 31:22)
uh not much to share about these games i (31:20 - 31:25)
guess these again so 2004 2013 this was (31:22 - 31:28)
kind of when i was at pokemon (31:25 - 31:28)
uh more spin-offs gamecube just landed (31:30 - 31:35)
down with pokemon games pokemon xd gale (31:33 - 31:37)
of darkness (31:35 - 31:38)
uh so i can't remember is this called (31:37 - 31:41)
shadow lugia (31:38 - 31:41)
which uh (31:42 - 31:45)
we have shadow mewtwo in pokken (31:44 - 31:47)
tournament which we'll get to (31:45 - 31:50)
uh but safe to say that probably shadow (31:47 - 31:51)
mewtwo is going to stay in pokken (31:50 - 31:54)
tournament just like shadow lugia stayed (31:51 - 31:55)
in caleb darkness (31:54 - 31:57)
the main series game had no space for (31:55 - 31:59)
shadoluya (31:57 - 32:00)
and then if you like puzzle games (31:59 - 32:03)
pokemon troj (32:00 - 32:06)
that exists (32:03 - 32:06)
pokemon spin-off so this is 2006. (32:06 - 32:12)
uh we have pokemon ranger and this is (32:10 - 32:13)
very interesting so when we were in the (32:12 - 32:14)
ds (32:13 - 32:16)
uh mystery dungeon had a game boy (32:14 - 32:18)
advanced specific game which is red (32:16 - 32:21)
rescue team and then a3 uh 2ds or 2ds (32:18 - 32:23)
regular ds (32:21 - 32:25)
uno ds (32:23 - 32:27)
blue rescue team (32:25 - 32:28)
i've never played any of these games but (32:27 - 32:29)
i heard these are some of the more (32:28 - 32:32)
popular mystery dungeon games um (32:29 - 32:34)
i played gates to infinity and did not (32:32 - 32:36)
enjoy it (32:34 - 32:39)
uh we have more pokemon ranger because (32:36 - 32:42)
yokai watch was an early fad back then (32:39 - 32:43)
as you can see by that little trainer (32:42 - 32:46)
that looks like yokai watch (32:43 - 32:46)
and then we have pokemon battle (32:47 - 32:50)
revolution which i thought (32:48 - 32:51)
would be awesome (32:50 - 32:54)
i thought this was pokemon stadium 3. (32:51 - 32:57)
it was not (32:54 - 33:01)
it's like pokemon state in point five (32:57 - 33:01)
uh it was it was cool though it's uh (33:01 - 33:05)
battle revolution was cool because this (33:04 - 33:07)
was before (33:05 - 33:09)
x and y so we actually got (33:07 - 33:13)
decently looking 3d pokemon again (33:09 - 33:15)
and boy were they pumping out spinoffs (33:13 - 33:17)
back then all right we have explorers of (33:15 - 33:20)
the sky mystery dungeon (33:17 - 33:23)
it's very crazy in 2008 2009 and then we (33:20 - 33:25)
have explorers of darkness and explorers (33:23 - 33:27)
of time i didn't play any of these games (33:25 - 33:30)
either did you guys (33:27 - 33:30)
uh (33:34 - 33:38)
we have (33:35 - 33:38)
which (33:42 - 33:46)
you might think i would hate but pokey (33:44 - 33:48)
parkway is actually a pretty cool game (33:46 - 33:50)
and the pokemon the actual pokemon (33:48 - 33:52)
models on the game are legit they are (33:50 - 33:55)
really cool (33:52 - 33:55)
i feel like these people also like (34:00 - 34:04)
firing them (34:01 - 34:04)
so we have pokemon conquest and then we (34:04 - 34:09)
have uh pokey park two wonders beyond (34:06 - 34:12)
again pokey park (34:09 - 34:14)
if you want a mindless game that looks (34:12 - 34:15)
really good and it's kind of funny pokey (34:14 - 34:17)
park is not bad (34:15 - 34:20)
uh and then pokemon rumble blast (34:17 - 34:21)
which is a mindless game that does not (34:20 - 34:23)
have the good character that pokey park (34:21 - 34:25)
has (34:23 - 34:25)
more spin-offs we have uh gates is that (34:25 - 34:30)
infinity yeah (34:28 - 34:31)
not a good game (34:30 - 34:34)
uh we have pokemon rumble u which is (34:31 - 34:36)
it's okay (34:34 - 34:38)
it has uh amiibos before they wear (34:36 - 34:40)
amiibos (34:38 - 34:40)
2014. can't believe this was only two (34:41 - 34:46)
years ago we have pokemon battle troj (34:43 - 34:47)
which is okay and then pokemon art (34:46 - 34:49)
academy to teach you how to draw (34:47 - 34:53)
squirtle just as badly (34:49 - 34:53)
2015. (34:57 - 35:00)
more mystery dungeons super mystery (35:01 - 35:06)
dungeon to be exact pokemon shuffle (35:03 - 35:06)
which (35:06 - 35:07)
i (35:06 - 35:10)
adore pokemon shuffle (35:07 - 35:12)
i usually don't like free to play games (35:10 - 35:15)
don't really play games on my (35:12 - 35:18)
iphone but pokemon shuffle game is red (35:15 - 35:20)
it's really good (35:18 - 35:22)
uh pokemon rumble world again it was an (35:20 - 35:24)
eshop game free to play but there is a (35:22 - 35:26)
digital or there is a physical copy (35:24 - 35:28)
release available and the pokemon pick (35:26 - 35:29)
cross (35:28 - 35:32)
which is okay it's across (35:29 - 35:34)
it exists (35:32 - 35:37)
and then finally (35:34 - 35:40)
2016. (35:37 - 35:40)
okay (35:41 - 35:44)
i was going to ask it doesn't matter (35:42 - 35:46)
it's ask audience who has pokemon (35:44 - 35:49)
but from the round of applause yes (35:46 - 35:51)
pokken is really good (35:49 - 35:54)
uh it is (35:51 - 35:56)
i did i did a full review on it on my (35:54 - 35:58)
podcast it's about 45 minutes of me (35:56 - 35:59)
going through pokem before it was (35:58 - 36:00)
released (35:59 - 36:02)
obviously you guys can play the game for (36:00 - 36:04)
yourself but if you're still on defense (36:02 - 36:06)
for pokken i would say (36:04 - 36:08)
that if you like super smash brothers (36:06 - 36:10)
you would like pokken (36:08 - 36:12)
if you don't like smash brothers (36:10 - 36:14)
tokens probably not going to seal the (36:12 - 36:16)
deal for you i mean unless you play (36:14 - 36:19)
smash brothers because of the pokemon (36:16 - 36:21)
okay you could probably get pokken but (36:19 - 36:23)
if you don't like anything in smash (36:21 - 36:24)
brothers you're probably not going to (36:23 - 36:25)
like pokken (36:24 - 36:27)
i'm very bad at fighting games (36:25 - 36:30)
i've lost a lot of times already (36:27 - 36:32)
but it's still good and i plan on (36:30 - 36:34)
playing it every thursday night with uh (36:32 - 36:37)
with my pokemon community so if that's (36:34 - 36:38)
something you're into if you want to (36:37 - 36:40)
beat me because i'm very easily beaten (36:38 - 36:42)
in pokken (36:40 - 36:44)
there we go also my favorite pokemon is (36:42 - 36:46)
machamp (36:44 - 36:49)
i never was a big machamp fan (36:46 - 36:50)
but playing with champion pokken (36:49 - 36:53)
realized made me realize that he was the (36:50 - 36:56)
wrestler i wanted to be (36:53 - 36:56)
and then finally (36:59 - 37:02)
we can do some (37:00 - 37:03)
q and a (37:02 - 37:05)
if you guys have any questions i will (37:03 - 37:07)
answer them we have about 20 minutes not (37:05 - 37:08)
a good time (37:07 - 37:10)
right here (37:08 - 37:11)
i mean (37:10 - 37:13)
tournament it's not like another word (37:11 - 37:15)
uh so the poker tournament is made by (37:13 - 37:17)
the people who made tekken from (37:15 - 37:20)
nam ko bandai so you would think that (37:17 - 37:22)
pokken would be more like tekken but (37:20 - 37:24)
it's not but it's made by the tekken (37:22 - 37:26)
team so that's where the pokken comes (37:24 - 37:28)
from (37:26 - 37:28)
if somebody's hand go up and then go (37:30 - 37:32)
down (37:32 - 37:34)
there (37:32 - 37:35)
yeah (37:34 - 37:36)
most important question i've ever had (37:35 - 37:39)
about pokemon what do you tips doing (37:36 - 37:42)
uh annoy you (37:39 - 37:42)
i don't remember that (37:42 - 37:46)
i only played through x and y at once (37:44 - 37:46)
but (37:46 - 37:47)
um (37:46 - 37:51)
i don't remember what the tips do (37:47 - 37:53)
i was going to say they actually (37:51 - 37:54)
increased like your coolness and i have (37:53 - 37:58)
access to the hiring your coolness (37:54 - 38:01)
that's something i still struggle with (37:58 - 38:01)
way in the back (38:01 - 38:06)
will they ever bring back (38:03 - 38:06)
shadow pokemon well we have shadow (38:06 - 38:11)
mewtwo now in pokken and we have we had (38:08 - 38:14)
chattalookia but i think (38:11 - 38:15)
to be honest i think that's something (38:14 - 38:17)
that is for spin-off games i don't think (38:15 - 38:18)
that's something for the main series (38:17 - 38:20)
game i don't know how you would (38:18 - 38:21)
introduce that in the main series (38:20 - 38:22)
without making that like a type or (38:21 - 38:24)
something like we have dark we have (38:22 - 38:24)
ghosts (38:24 - 38:26)
i don't know how you would introduce (38:24 - 38:28)
that without offsetting the balance (38:26 - 38:30)
i was always a big (38:28 - 38:32)
like i always thought that fairy wasn't (38:30 - 38:34)
the last type they were ever going to do (38:32 - 38:36)
if you listen to my podcast i'm very big (38:34 - 38:38)
on them introducing like a sound type (38:36 - 38:39)
because there's so many sound type moves (38:38 - 38:40)
in the game (38:39 - 38:44)
the growl roar sonic boom (38:40 - 38:47)
explode is a pokemon that exists noiburn (38:44 - 38:50)
has a giant boombox on its head (38:47 - 38:53)
uh but i don't know without i i'm (38:50 - 38:55)
starting to think it's too soon to (38:53 - 38:56)
introduce a new type just because we (38:55 - 38:58)
still have fairy trying to work out with (38:56 - 39:01)
dragon (38:58 - 39:02)
but (39:01 - 39:03)
i don't think shadow would ever be like (39:02 - 39:05)
a type or anything to bring in i think (39:03 - 39:07)
that's kind of like a spin-off now that (39:05 - 39:09)
we've seen it twice with lugia and (39:07 - 39:10)
mewtwo i think that's kind of a spin-off (39:09 - 39:12)
thing i could be wrong though shadow (39:10 - 39:15)
mewtwo could be the main bad guy in sun (39:12 - 39:16)
moon sunday news (39:15 - 39:19)
right over here (39:16 - 39:19)
the shadow pokemon (39:20 - 39:24)
ghost pokemon are actually ghosts yes i (39:22 - 39:25)
do think so (39:24 - 39:26)
uh (39:25 - 39:28)
you have well you have a you have a (39:26 - 39:30)
bunch of ghost pokemon you have (39:28 - 39:32)
ghastly haunter and gengar obviously (39:30 - 39:33)
they can go through walls if you play (39:32 - 39:35)
pokken gengar goes right through the (39:33 - 39:38)
grass appears behind you throws a giant (39:35 - 39:40)
punch at you out of nowhere (39:38 - 39:42)
um (39:40 - 39:44)
but uh there are other ghost pokemon (39:42 - 39:47)
like golurk i believe it's a ghost right (39:44 - 39:48)
yeah (39:47 - 39:50)
ghost ground but he was actually made by (39:48 - 39:52)
man he's man-made uh pokemon just like (39:50 - 39:56)
genesect and mewtwo (39:52 - 39:57)
so i don't know how that works (39:56 - 39:59)
how (39:57 - 40:01)
people can make a ghost but girl looks (39:59 - 40:02)
cool if you ever watch the black and (40:01 - 40:04)
white movie he turns into a giant rocket (40:02 - 40:05)
blast into the air (40:04 - 40:08)
you can't go wrong with that (40:05 - 40:08)
in the back (40:08 - 40:11)
i took notes because i knew somebody was (40:12 - 40:14)
gonna ask that (40:13 - 40:17)
uh i really like water pokemon which is (40:14 - 40:19)
funny and funny about me is i can't swim (40:17 - 40:22)
at all again going back back to me not (40:19 - 40:24)
being athletic i can't wrestle i can't (40:22 - 40:26)
swim (40:24 - 40:28)
i can't talk uh but i really like water (40:26 - 40:30)
pokemon a lot (40:28 - 40:32)
i like i have a new (40:30 - 40:36)
found addiction to ducklit (40:32 - 40:39)
i think duckling is real cool (40:36 - 40:42)
uh real awesome swanda though swanna's (40:39 - 40:44)
lame i get it like the swan and the duck (40:42 - 40:45)
i get it (40:44 - 40:47)
but swanna you're not cool (40:45 - 40:50)
i'll keep a duckling (40:47 - 40:50)
okay (40:50 - 40:53)
uh so my favorite pokemon ever is (41:00 - 41:02)
farfetch (41:01 - 41:04)
and if farfetch could get a mega (41:02 - 41:06)
evolution (41:04 - 41:09)
i could die happy because firebatch is (41:06 - 41:10)
real cool (41:09 - 41:12)
um (41:10 - 41:14)
i always thought machamp should get a (41:12 - 41:16)
mega evolution if you look at red and (41:14 - 41:18)
blue uh machamp is the complete opposite (41:16 - 41:21)
in every aspect of alakazam (41:18 - 41:23)
the you need to trade cadaver you need (41:21 - 41:26)
to trade machoke uh alakazam is all (41:23 - 41:28)
about special attack when champs is all (41:26 - 41:29)
about physical attack they're complete (41:28 - 41:31)
opposites (41:29 - 41:33)
and i think they were exclusive to each (41:31 - 41:34)
other's game too i could be wrong on (41:33 - 41:35)
that but (41:34 - 41:38)
uh machamp feels like a given for a mega (41:35 - 41:39)
evolution (41:38 - 41:41)
so i feel like that's gonna happen uh (41:39 - 41:43)
farfetch is a dream that i want to (41:41 - 41:44)
happen (41:43 - 41:47)
um i think though (41:44 - 41:51)
hypno is very forgotten about (41:47 - 41:53)
and mega evolution (41:51 - 41:55)
like restores (41:53 - 41:58)
people's faith back into certain pokemon (41:55 - 42:00)
like no one cared about beedrill and (41:58 - 42:02)
then they gave it mega bee drone you're (42:00 - 42:05)
like yeah beetroot's cool now he's real (42:02 - 42:06)
cool (42:05 - 42:07)
um (42:06 - 42:08)
so (42:07 - 42:11)
if you were to ask me like more pokemon (42:08 - 42:12)
i would say pokemon that are forgotten (42:11 - 42:14)
about like hypno like bear tick like (42:12 - 42:16)
huntail like to me those all deserve (42:14 - 42:19)
mega evolutions because (42:16 - 42:21)
they're they get forgotten about them (42:19 - 42:23)
they're cool well hypno maybe not so (42:21 - 42:25)
much (42:23 - 42:25)
the center yeah (42:26 - 42:29)
uh the question was the concept of about (42:32 - 42:37)
pokemon capturing animals and forcing (42:35 - 42:40)
them to fight (42:37 - 42:40)
yes (42:43 - 42:47)
i think i think pokemon does a lot of (42:45 - 42:48)
things and i think that's forgotten (42:47 - 42:50)
about especially for people who don't (42:48 - 42:52)
play pokemon or people who go oh (42:50 - 42:54)
pokemon's still a thing (42:52 - 42:56)
there's a lot of aspects of pokemon like (42:54 - 42:57)
competitive battling (42:56 - 43:00)
and you see that in like the super bowl (42:57 - 43:01)
commercial i don't know if you guys saw (43:00 - 43:02)
the super bowl commercial that pokemon (43:01 - 43:04)
did (43:02 - 43:05)
but it wasn't (43:04 - 43:08)
it wasn't about (43:05 - 43:09)
two animals fighting (43:08 - 43:11)
it was about (43:09 - 43:14)
competing at like a strategic level and (43:11 - 43:16)
what having people watch and be excited (43:14 - 43:19)
about competition and how like that (43:16 - 43:20)
brings people together that's why you (43:19 - 43:22)
get so many people watching football (43:20 - 43:24)
yeah anyone could play football (43:22 - 43:26)
i'd go out and attempt to throw a (43:24 - 43:29)
football but it's about like (43:26 - 43:31)
bringing people together and like (43:29 - 43:33)
sharing strategies and competitively (43:31 - 43:35)
battling and (43:33 - 43:37)
having that form around that central (43:35 - 43:38)
thought (43:37 - 43:40)
but then there are other aspects like (43:38 - 43:42)
trading and collecting (43:40 - 43:43)
for me i'm not a competitive battler (43:42 - 43:46)
because i'm not good at it but (43:43 - 43:47)
i'm all about trying to fill out my (43:46 - 43:49)
pokedex i'm all about getting (43:47 - 43:51)
the event exclusive pokemon and like (43:49 - 43:54)
keeping those and like when pokemon bank (43:51 - 43:55)
came out i was like oh my god like this (43:54 - 43:57)
is what i always wanted i want to keep (43:55 - 43:59)
my pokemon from generation to generation (43:57 - 44:01)
and when my kids have pokemon i want to (43:59 - 44:03)
go like this is the (44:01 - 44:05)
scrafty that i got from pokemon worlds (44:03 - 44:07)
in 2012 like (44:05 - 44:09)
it's event specific and it was only (44:07 - 44:10)
available in this time and like now you (44:09 - 44:12)
can have it you can raise it to be yours (44:10 - 44:14)
like i want those memories (44:12 - 44:16)
and then there's the aspect of just like (44:14 - 44:18)
meeting new people like when i started (44:16 - 44:21)
my podcast almost six years ago (44:18 - 44:23)
i didn't have like i didn't really know (44:21 - 44:25)
that many people who played pokemon (44:23 - 44:26)
besides (44:25 - 44:27)
you know the people i worked with or the (44:26 - 44:28)
people (44:27 - 44:30)
or some of my close friends but like (44:28 - 44:32)
community and connecting with people is (44:30 - 44:34)
such a big thing in pokemon and i think (44:32 - 44:35)
that's (44:34 - 44:37)
not really talked about a lot like you (44:35 - 44:39)
guys are all here because you like (44:37 - 44:40)
pokemon you're listening to me talk (44:39 - 44:42)
because you like pokemon and that's (44:40 - 44:44)
really cool and there's not a lot of (44:42 - 44:46)
other games that really bring that (44:44 - 44:48)
together like i'm sure some of you right (44:46 - 44:50)
now are street passing with each other (44:48 - 44:52)
and possibly trading or battling and (44:50 - 44:55)
that's stuff that just kind of goes on (44:52 - 44:56)
um (44:55 - 44:59)
there was something i lost my trunk on (44:56 - 45:00)
uh (44:59 - 45:03)
[Music] (45:00 - 45:03)
cool great question what game features (45:05 - 45:08)
would i like to see in sun and moon uh (45:06 - 45:09)
the biggest thing (45:08 - 45:12)
is trainer customization (45:09 - 45:14)
i want that to come back i thought that (45:12 - 45:16)
was very important (45:14 - 45:17)
for me (45:16 - 45:19)
some of my my least favorite series is (45:17 - 45:21)
probably black and white (45:19 - 45:23)
and the reason i say that is because i (45:21 - 45:26)
felt like black and white focused on n (45:23 - 45:29)
the trainer it didn't focus on you (45:26 - 45:31)
and when i play pokemon game i want it (45:29 - 45:33)
to be about me it's my journey it's (45:31 - 45:35)
me going from start to finish it's me (45:33 - 45:38)
collecting these pokemon it's me raising (45:35 - 45:39)
and making connections with these (45:38 - 45:41)
pokemon and black and white black and (45:39 - 45:43)
white 2 is all about n (45:41 - 45:45)
well you know n thinks this n thinks (45:43 - 45:47)
that ended this ended then (45:45 - 45:48)
and (45:47 - 45:50)
it just didn't feel like it was my (45:48 - 45:52)
journey it felt like i was following n's (45:50 - 45:53)
journey and that's why i don't care for (45:52 - 45:55)
black and white so when they brought (45:53 - 45:58)
trainer customization to x and y and (45:55 - 46:00)
they gave me friends which was okay i (45:58 - 46:01)
kind of wish i could name my friends or (46:00 - 46:02)
like at least nicknamed my friends like (46:01 - 46:05)
in animal crossing (46:02 - 46:05)
or like an animal crossing they would be (46:06 - 46:09)
like (46:08 - 46:10)
hey (46:09 - 46:12)
french toast do you like that nickname (46:10 - 46:13)
french toast you're like no i don't (46:12 - 46:16)
they're like oh okay (46:13 - 46:19)
never mind then um (46:16 - 46:21)
i wish that stuff got brought into (46:19 - 46:23)
pokemon at least to the aspect of like (46:21 - 46:25)
let me name my friends but the trainer (46:23 - 46:27)
customization was such a big thing of (46:25 - 46:28)
like (46:27 - 46:30)
i'm different now i can wear what i want (46:28 - 46:31)
i can change my skin color i can change (46:30 - 46:33)
my hair i can change my eyes so if they (46:31 - 46:35)
can bring that back that would probably (46:33 - 46:38)
be the number one thing on my wish list (46:35 - 46:38)
i think the given of like admin pokemon (46:39 - 46:43)
i really like the rollerblade system and (46:41 - 46:45)
that was a big thing of why i didn't (46:43 - 46:47)
really like omega ruby out the sapphire (46:45 - 46:48)
is because they took away my (46:47 - 46:49)
rollerblades and they gave me the (46:48 - 46:51)
sneaking mechanic (46:49 - 46:53)
and i'm one of the most impatient (46:51 - 46:54)
players in the game (46:53 - 46:57)
so the fact that i'm slower (46:54 - 46:58)
already because i don't have roller (46:57 - 46:59)
blades and then the fact that you can (46:58 - 47:02)
make me even slower to sneak like again (46:59 - 47:04)
sneaking school but (47:02 - 47:05)
let me just like run full-blown give me (47:04 - 47:07)
my skateboard and (47:05 - 47:09)
gold and silver (47:07 - 47:11)
that's what i want (47:09 - 47:13)
right here (47:11 - 47:15)
what do you think about this one theory (47:13 - 47:18)
which came first rcs review oh man (47:15 - 47:19)
theories (47:18 - 47:21)
ah the question was what came first (47:19 - 47:24)
arceus or mu (47:21 - 47:27)
that's a tough one uh i would i my gut (47:24 - 47:29)
tells me arceus came first that would be (47:27 - 47:31)
my gut um (47:29 - 47:33)
but you know giratina (47:31 - 47:35)
he's real cool (47:33 - 47:39)
and he's the opposite kind of (47:35 - 47:41)
uh right here (47:39 - 47:43)
what are your thoughts on pokemon go (47:41 - 47:45)
pokemon go uh so actually yesterday (47:43 - 47:47)
there was a video from south by (47:45 - 47:50)
southwest that showed about 45 seconds (47:47 - 47:52)
of pokemon go footage and there was (47:50 - 47:54)
rumors and speculations that this was (47:52 - 47:56)
fake footage but it was uploaded from a (47:54 - 47:58)
couple different angles (47:56 - 47:59)
and (47:58 - 48:02)
uh i'm friends with joe from cerebe (47:59 - 48:03)
i'm sure you guys have all heard of that (48:02 - 48:05)
little little website it's a little (48:03 - 48:06)
pokemon website very small (48:05 - 48:07)
um (48:06 - 48:10)
but he usually only posts something on (48:07 - 48:12)
cerave when there's enough information (48:10 - 48:14)
to prove that it's real and he did post (48:12 - 48:16)
it and (48:14 - 48:17)
uh (48:16 - 48:18)
looking through conversations it didn't (48:17 - 48:22)
seem real it doesn't seem (48:18 - 48:24)
let me back up i didn't have very high (48:22 - 48:26)
expectations for pokemon go and the (48:24 - 48:28)
reason that i say that is because i (48:26 - 48:30)
didn't really like ingress i went (48:28 - 48:33)
through ingress is the game that niantic (48:30 - 48:35)
made before pokemon go ingress is like (48:33 - 48:37)
this it's pretty much pokemon go without (48:35 - 48:40)
pokemon or at least the central (48:37 - 48:43)
shared thought process um so i wasn't a (48:40 - 48:45)
big fan of ingress the people who like (48:43 - 48:47)
ingress really like ingress they like (48:45 - 48:50)
ingress a lot (48:47 - 48:51)
so i didn't have high expectations for (48:50 - 48:54)
pokemon go when i saw the 45 seconds (48:51 - 48:56)
which was pretty much (48:54 - 48:58)
if you watch the video it's an ivy sword (48:56 - 49:00)
and they show them going into their (48:58 - 49:02)
inventory picking a pokeball throwing (49:00 - 49:04)
the pokeball it wiggles twice ivysaur (49:02 - 49:08)
gets out because they didn't hold down b (49:04 - 49:08)
and (49:09 - 49:12)
they go okay and they go back in their (49:10 - 49:14)
inventory and they skip past the great (49:12 - 49:15)
ball and they skip past the altar ball (49:14 - 49:17)
and they go right to the master ball (49:15 - 49:19)
gotta catch that ivy sword (49:17 - 49:21)
and of course uh obviously at that point (49:19 - 49:23)
there's like zero like (49:21 - 49:25)
it's not tense anymore because the (49:23 - 49:26)
master ball is going to work unless you (49:25 - 49:27)
programmed it wrong like you did the (49:26 - 49:29)
moon ball but (49:27 - 49:31)
they catch the ivy sword and then they (49:29 - 49:32)
kind of showed the overwhelm the map and (49:31 - 49:34)
that was it and you're just like well (49:32 - 49:36)
that's all the game is it's (49:34 - 49:39)
not that exciting (49:36 - 49:40)
i i (49:39 - 49:42)
don't have a high expectations for it i (49:40 - 49:45)
think it'll still be cool i think though (49:42 - 49:46)
that you're going to get in a situation (49:45 - 49:48)
where it's like you get three free (49:46 - 49:50)
pokeballs a day and if you run out you (49:48 - 49:52)
can buy more you can buy five pokeballs (49:50 - 49:54)
from 99 cents hey you really want to (49:52 - 49:56)
catch that guard chump (49:54 - 49:57)
now you're out of pokeballs well this (49:56 - 49:59)
master ball is 4.99 (49:57 - 50:02)
and it guarantees success (49:59 - 50:03)
uh i think that's what you're going to (50:02 - 50:05)
see with pokemon go obviously they did (50:03 - 50:06)
say there's going to be micro (50:05 - 50:08)
transactions and whatnot but based off (50:06 - 50:11)
the 45 seconds i saw which is not a lot (50:08 - 50:13)
it kind of (50:11 - 50:15)
re-assured me that (50:13 - 50:18)
i probably shouldn't get so excited (50:15 - 50:19)
about this this should this is just (50:18 - 50:20)
something on the side it's just like (50:19 - 50:22)
pokemon shuffle except pokemon shuffle (50:20 - 50:25)
is really good (50:22 - 50:27)
right over there yep (50:25 - 50:29)
so pokemon you've always started out as (50:27 - 50:32)
a single trainer young kid going (50:29 - 50:33)
uh (50:32 - 50:37)
how would you like to see the main story (50:33 - 50:38)
i would love that the question was how (50:37 - 50:40)
would you like to see the main story (50:38 - 50:42)
completely changed from the you know 10 (50:40 - 50:44)
year old boy which i am (50:42 - 50:46)
going from time to time collecting eight (50:44 - 50:47)
badges (50:46 - 50:49)
i think right now (50:47 - 50:51)
you you suffer the problem of you can't (50:49 - 50:53)
make the games too hard or tricky (50:51 - 50:55)
difficult because you're always getting (50:53 - 50:56)
new (50:55 - 50:58)
pokemon trainers coming (50:56 - 50:59)
but you can't make (50:58 - 51:00)
the games (50:59 - 51:02)
well right now the games are too easy i (51:00 - 51:04)
think for all of us who have been (51:02 - 51:05)
playing for years the games are pretty (51:04 - 51:06)
easy (51:05 - 51:08)
and i was really happy with x and y like (51:06 - 51:09)
going through the first gym i was like (51:08 - 51:11)
yeah this feels good then there was that (51:09 - 51:13)
long wait before the second gym and you (51:11 - 51:15)
get there and you battle and you're like (51:13 - 51:17)
yep this feels this is what i want this (51:15 - 51:19)
you're doing it right game freak (51:17 - 51:21)
and then all of a sudden the third gym (51:19 - 51:22)
came fortune came to the fifth gym and (51:21 - 51:24)
it was just like so piled up (51:22 - 51:26)
and then at that point the game kind of (51:24 - 51:28)
became a cakewalk and i would like to (51:26 - 51:29)
see (51:28 - 51:31)
if they're gonna keep the eight gyms (51:29 - 51:34)
let every gem be ten levels (51:31 - 51:36)
gym number one you gotta be level ten (51:34 - 51:37)
gym number two you gotta be level twenty (51:36 - 51:39)
gym number three you gotta be level 30 (51:37 - 51:40)
because we're getting to that point (51:39 - 51:42)
where (51:40 - 51:42)
either (51:42 - 51:44)
fix the balance or bring down the (51:42 - 51:46)
maximum level to 50 because nothing (51:44 - 51:48)
matters after 50. you're either getting (51:46 - 51:50)
round up to a level 100 you're getting (51:48 - 51:52)
rounded down to 50. and there's yeah (51:50 - 51:53)
there's cynthia and there's some stuff (51:52 - 51:54)
there but (51:53 - 51:57)
i think that's a big (51:54 - 51:59)
that's a big like (51:57 - 52:01)
wall for me is how easy the games are (51:59 - 52:02)
and maybe (52:01 - 52:03)
there's a (52:02 - 52:06)
like beginner mode or like advanced mode (52:03 - 52:07)
before you start the new game or (52:06 - 52:09)
something i would like to see that to (52:07 - 52:11)
mix it up i mean you're not changing it (52:09 - 52:12)
drastically you're still getting the (52:11 - 52:14)
eight gyms but like (52:12 - 52:15)
don't let me just plow through (52:14 - 52:18)
everything with a blaziken like (52:15 - 52:21)
give me some challenge (52:18 - 52:25)
right here looking (52:21 - 52:25)
uh good question is kyogre a frog or a (52:34 - 52:40)
whale uh kyogre is a whale (52:37 - 52:42)
no frog (52:40 - 52:44)
there are frog pokemon like seismitoad (52:42 - 52:46)
but he's not cool if you want a cool (52:44 - 52:50)
frog you want polytote (52:46 - 52:50)
speaking of mega evolution poly toad (52:51 - 52:57)
needs a magnet evolution (52:54 - 53:00)
way in the back (52:57 - 53:00)
uh question was how do you think they (53:01 - 53:06)
made an mmorpg um (53:03 - 53:08)
i would not like that actually (53:06 - 53:09)
that's brought up at every panel i've (53:08 - 53:11)
been doing this panel for five years and (53:09 - 53:12)
i always get that question (53:11 - 53:14)
and if you asked me that five years ago (53:12 - 53:16)
even four years ago i would have said (53:14 - 53:18)
yes i want that (53:16 - 53:21)
but now i don't (53:18 - 53:22)
and the reason i say that is because i (53:21 - 53:23)
don't want to be going through my (53:22 - 53:26)
adventure and going hey battle me hey (53:23 - 53:28)
battle me like i'm already trying to (53:26 - 53:31)
avoid the trainers (53:28 - 53:35)
i don't need to avoid real-life trainers (53:31 - 53:35)
so there so i play two games a lot i (53:38 - 53:42)
play destiny a lot and i play final (53:41 - 53:45)
fantasy (53:42 - 53:46)
i don't know what those moves are for (53:45 - 53:47)
either one (53:46 - 53:50)
but i think destiny does (53:47 - 53:51)
the (53:50 - 53:54)
quote-unquote mmo really well where (53:51 - 53:56)
you see other people in the world but (53:54 - 53:57)
you don't really interact with them (53:56 - 53:59)
unless they're in your party (53:57 - 54:02)
and i think (53:59 - 54:04)
pokemon could benefit from that at least (54:02 - 54:07)
in like have a town where you could like (54:04 - 54:09)
see a bunch of people walking around (54:07 - 54:11)
and that would be really cool in a (54:09 - 54:13)
social aspect of like hey let's trade or (54:11 - 54:15)
like hey let's give items obviously you (54:13 - 54:18)
can't battle on towns (54:15 - 54:20)
but then maybe when you go into the (54:18 - 54:22)
the over world you see people but you (54:20 - 54:24)
can't really interact with them and i (54:22 - 54:25)
think that would be okay i think what (54:24 - 54:27)
pokemon's missing or what people (54:25 - 54:29)
actually want is just (54:27 - 54:32)
a world that doesn't feel empty (54:29 - 54:34)
and i think that's a good compromise (54:32 - 54:36)
where um (54:34 - 54:37)
is in like a full mmo like final fantasy (54:36 - 54:40)
14 it's just like consistent everything (54:37 - 54:43)
happening all the time and um (54:40 - 54:44)
i don't think that would work but i (54:43 - 54:46)
think if you did like a destiny approach (54:44 - 54:48)
where it's like well you get some (54:46 - 54:49)
interaction here and you get a little (54:48 - 54:51)
bit more interaction here (54:49 - 54:52)
i think that would work really well and (54:51 - 54:54)
that's kind of what i would want to see (54:52 - 54:56)
but as for a full mmo i was like (54:54 - 54:58)
no stop asking to battle me i'm just (54:56 - 55:01)
trying to get to saffron city (54:58 - 55:03)
right here is there any particular type (55:01 - 55:05)
of weird pokemon you'd like to see like (55:03 - 55:06)
we have an ice cream cone we have a (55:05 - 55:08)
garbage bag reached rubbish is there any (55:06 - 55:10)
particular weirdo (55:08 - 55:11)
that's a good question i've never got (55:10 - 55:13)
asked that uh (55:11 - 55:14)
so we'll probably do one more question (55:13 - 55:16)
after this just because we're for the (55:14 - 55:18)
sake of time but the question was would (55:16 - 55:20)
any weird pokemon like a garbage can or (55:18 - 55:21)
a (55:20 - 55:23)
ice cream cone (55:21 - 55:26)
i would like to see (55:23 - 55:28)
and this is kind of cheating but i would (55:26 - 55:31)
like to see a woodpecker pokemon (55:28 - 55:32)
a lot of people think that in the (55:31 - 55:35)
preview for sun and moon the one pokemon (55:32 - 55:37)
they did show was a woodpecker (55:35 - 55:39)
and i never thought of it before but (55:37 - 55:41)
then i was like yeah woodpeckers are (55:39 - 55:42)
cool right (55:41 - 55:44)
yeah woodpeckers (55:42 - 55:45)
um (55:44 - 55:47)
i don't know what else as like weird (55:45 - 55:48)
pokemon (55:47 - 55:50)
[Music] (55:48 - 55:51)
i'm surprised we haven't gotten like (55:50 - 55:53)
some kind of like (55:51 - 55:55)
uh i was gonna say tv but rotom almost (55:53 - 55:56)
gets that (55:55 - 55:58)
but like some kind of like (55:56 - 56:00)
like cell phone or something (55:58 - 56:02)
because you see like cleft key with the (56:00 - 56:05)
keys and stuff so (56:02 - 56:05)
yeah i'm trying to think ice cream's (56:06 - 56:09)
real it's hard to beat ice cream (56:07 - 56:11)
it's real hard (56:09 - 56:14)
maybe like cookies (56:11 - 56:18)
all right one more right in the center (56:14 - 56:18)
yes the question was do you ever think (56:27 - 56:30)
they would add a dolphin pokemon and (56:28 - 56:32)
yeah i don't know if japan hates (56:30 - 56:34)
dolphins or (56:32 - 56:34)
that's (56:34 - 56:36)
like an animal they're they're not aware (56:34 - 56:38)
of but yeah there are i should go (56:36 - 56:39)
through and i should make a list of (56:38 - 56:41)
animals that are not pokemon obviously (56:39 - 56:43)
woodpecker would fit on this dolphin (56:41 - 56:45)
would be on the list um what was the (56:43 - 56:47)
week (56:45 - 56:47)
about a couple weeks ago (56:48 - 56:51)
oh yeah i saw that they did confirm that (56:51 - 56:55)
that was not real (56:53 - 56:55)
yeah (56:55 - 56:57)
there was a long like leak i think it (56:55 - 56:59)
was like 78 new pokemon (56:57 - 57:00)
um (56:59 - 57:01)
i don't know where it came from but the (57:00 - 57:03)
person who originally made it came out (57:01 - 57:05)
and said yeah that's (57:03 - 57:06)
not real (57:05 - 57:08)
um (57:06 - 57:08)
speaking of not real (57:08 - 57:13)
i think we're done (57:11 - 57:15)
uh so thank you guys so much for coming (57:13 - 57:17)
