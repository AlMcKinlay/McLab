to survive without my wit and charm (0:39 - 0:47)
my clever inside i'll skip that episode (0:43 - 0:47)
will also hear i realized this morning (0:49 - 0:54)
as i was driving around lake nokomis (0:52 - 0:57)
that i stan olivia newton john (0:54 - 1:00)
oh yeah come for her you come for me (0:57 - 1:01)
yeah (1:00 - 1:04)
i okay (1:01 - 1:04)
i (1:05 - 1:08)
first olivia newton john's first album (1:06 - 1:10)
was very country which is how i first (1:08 - 1:12)
knew libby newton yet she is australian (1:10 - 1:14)
correct which is just wild (1:12 - 1:17)
uh so i was a big fan of please mr (1:14 - 1:20)
please and then when physical hit (1:17 - 1:22)
it was like (1:20 - 1:27)
a seismic event in her career true true (1:22 - 1:29)
i love physical i still love the fact (1:27 - 1:30)
that (1:29 - 1:33)
my husband bless his little soul got (1:30 - 1:36)
into arguments at school that physical (1:33 - 1:40)
was only about exercising and nothing (1:36 - 1:42)
else (1:40 - 1:43)
what an innocent young man what an (1:42 - 1:47)
innocent child he was (1:43 - 1:47)
uh we got some news this week (1:47 - 1:52)
uh i played a lot of unite as well i (1:52 - 1:56)
don't know that's really that different (1:54 - 1:58)
it's like the same game they just add (1:56 - 1:59)
new characters that do like slightly (1:58 - 2:01)
different stuff (1:59 - 2:04)
uh i'm going to argue with you there (2:01 - 2:06)
emblems have changed the game eventually (2:04 - 2:09)
i think they're (2:06 - 2:09)
a nightmare to deal with (2:12 - 2:17)
i think the emblems are bad well i guess (2:14 - 2:19)
let's start with news (2:17 - 2:21)
uh (2:19 - 2:23)
unite has added emblems (2:21 - 2:25)
we talked about this last week i think (2:23 - 2:27)
the the easiest way i can sum that up to (2:25 - 2:29)
somebody who maybe doesn't play unite (2:27 - 2:31)
okay here's the thing one (2:29 - 2:33)
emblems brings no new players to unite i (2:31 - 2:35)
don't think anyone's like man i want (2:33 - 2:38)
this to be more complicated no i stopped (2:35 - 2:41)
playing because it was too simple please (2:38 - 2:44)
please throw some garbage in here like (2:41 - 2:46)
i don't think it's bringing anyone back (2:44 - 2:50)
i think it does (2:46 - 2:50)
further the gap between people who just (2:50 - 2:56)
want to play for fun and then the (2:54 - 2:59)
serious people i think that that gap (2:56 - 3:00)
widens (2:59 - 3:02)
the easiest way i can explain it is (3:00 - 3:03)
they're just (3:02 - 3:06)
it's the same as nature's uh an attack (3:03 - 3:07)
is getting (3:06 - 3:09)
or a stat is getting increased and (3:07 - 3:12)
another stat is getting decreased (3:09 - 3:14)
um (3:12 - 3:15)
they're (3:14 - 3:17)
they're it's another thing to collect (3:15 - 3:20)
and then to like customize and yeah i i (3:17 - 3:23)
would i would always usually be in the (3:20 - 3:25)
in the fence (3:23 - 3:28)
on the side of the fence (3:25 - 3:28)
i could be on a fence that's true (3:28 - 3:32)
that would be like more customization (3:36 - 3:41)
stuff is better (3:38 - 3:41)
but i still don't really see the huge (3:41 - 3:47)
i don't see the draw here besides like (3:44 - 3:49)
we're min-maxing (3:47 - 3:51)
uh our characters and everyone's gonna (3:49 - 3:53)
run pretty similar like (3:51 - 3:55)
even in the sense of before you even get (3:53 - 3:58)
to the emblems there's usually (3:55 - 3:59)
of the (3:58 - 4:01)
the tree there's an opposite there's a (3:59 - 4:03)
meta there's a meta play and sometimes (4:01 - 4:05)
that changes like for a long time for (4:03 - 4:08)
cramer ant it was whirlpool surf or it's (4:05 - 4:11)
not sorry a hurricane surf and now it's (4:08 - 4:13)
dive air slash (4:11 - 4:15)
and maybe there's one person out there (4:13 - 4:16)
running (4:15 - 4:18)
hurricane dive i doubt that but maybe (4:16 - 4:21)
somebody out there's doing that but like (4:18 - 4:22)
i (4:21 - 4:25)
i don't know the emblems don't really (4:22 - 4:28)
they're not scratching any itches for me (4:25 - 4:30)
it seems they're scratching it is for me (4:28 - 4:32)
here's the thing (4:30 - 4:35)
there's the meta build and emblems are (4:32 - 4:37)
still new and what i like about emblems (4:35 - 4:39)
is emblems actually give (4:37 - 4:44)
players a chance to (4:39 - 4:44)
create (4:44 - 4:48)
the play that they want (4:46 - 4:50)
and emblems you can't spend money on (4:48 - 4:52)
them you just have to play the game to (4:50 - 4:54)
get them (4:52 - 4:56)
so what i like about it is that you (4:54 - 4:58)
cannot like right now emblems are real (4:56 - 5:00)
rough and i'm not going to say that (4:58 - 5:01)
they're not real rough like there's (5:00 - 5:03)
little reason not to run (5:01 - 5:06)
black for move reduction unless you (5:03 - 5:07)
don't have any black (5:06 - 5:09)
and they're hardly 40 times they're hard (5:07 - 5:11)
to get but what i do think in the future (5:09 - 5:15)
what it will do is allow people who (5:11 - 5:17)
like two people who play elder goss like (5:15 - 5:19)
right now i am not running (5:17 - 5:23)
hp up lds i am running (5:19 - 5:25)
uh special attack el de gas so that when (5:23 - 5:27)
people come to me (5:25 - 5:29)
i'm actually able to kill them rather (5:27 - 5:31)
quickly and they're surprised by that i (5:29 - 5:33)
think it gives for people who are really (5:31 - 5:36)
looking at the more competitive side of (5:33 - 5:39)
the game a way to differentiate (5:36 - 5:41)
a bunch of characters that already feel (5:39 - 5:42)
very samey samey (5:41 - 5:46)
so it adds a level of unknown (5:42 - 5:49)
that they can expand on like it is not a (5:46 - 5:51)
perfect system by any means right now (5:49 - 5:53)
like there's very little reason not to (5:51 - 5:56)
either run hp up or (5:53 - 5:58)
move reduction like the other ones are (5:56 - 5:59)
just so bad (5:58 - 6:01)
in comparison that there's no reason but (5:59 - 6:02)
i do think (6:01 - 6:05)
as we get through this initial stage and (6:02 - 6:07)
they sort of see the power of it (6:05 - 6:10)
that it will be a great way to have (6:07 - 6:12)
a bunch of pokemon even though they're (6:10 - 6:14)
different that play (6:12 - 6:15)
very similarly (6:14 - 6:18)
to feel very different when you are (6:15 - 6:20)
playing the meta of the game and it (6:18 - 6:24)
doesn't emblems don't stop (6:20 - 6:26)
casual either right like you could (6:24 - 6:27)
completely ignore it and play standard (6:26 - 6:29)
and be fine you can completely ignore it (6:27 - 6:30)
and (6:29 - 6:33)
get up through a lot of ranked it's just (6:30 - 6:35)
that the upper levels of rank you're (6:33 - 6:36)
going to run into a problem and it's a (6:35 - 6:40)
problem that can't be solved by money (6:36 - 6:40)
uh (6:41 - 6:46)
couldn't you no you can't buy like the (6:42 - 6:47)
whatever it's called you could i guess (6:46 - 6:48)
you could buy the accelerators you could (6:47 - 6:50)
buy the accelerators but it's still (6:48 - 6:52)
random what you get you can't pick (6:50 - 6:55)
you're still going to get a random (6:52 - 6:56)
selection of things so you can (6:55 - 7:00)
accelerate that process (6:56 - 7:00)
yeah i mean i ran no emblems at all for (7:01 - 7:06)
10 12 hours of the game (7:04 - 7:08)
and i was like everything still feels (7:06 - 7:12)
fine and then i was like i'm going to (7:08 - 7:12)
take the the emblems i have because i (7:12 - 7:17)
keep getting oddish over and over uh (7:14 - 7:19)
and then build something and i was like (7:17 - 7:21)
this feels zeroed like i don't feel any (7:19 - 7:22)
difference and maybe it's because like i (7:21 - 7:24)
don't have a big enough variety or i (7:22 - 7:27)
don't have golds or silvers or (7:24 - 7:29)
i mean the biggest problem is that you (7:27 - 7:30)
don't have enough black (7:29 - 7:32)
like nobody i have like two black i (7:30 - 7:33)
don't know (7:32 - 7:36)
i finally got a [ __ ] second i got up (7:33 - 7:37)
to four (7:36 - 7:40)
and i do notice it a little bit but you (7:37 - 7:42)
can tell people who have (7:40 - 7:45)
who somehow managed to get all seven it (7:42 - 7:46)
is just (7:45 - 7:48)
wild what they can do (7:46 - 7:50)
and i do think it needs to be tweaked (7:48 - 7:52)
right like they do need to figure out (7:50 - 7:54)
how to make the other aspects (7:52 - 7:55)
better (7:54 - 7:57)
and i don't know yet what that looks (7:55 - 7:59)
like but i do like the fact that (7:57 - 8:02)
it allows (7:59 - 8:04)
a way to customize more to your play (8:02 - 8:07)
style than the items ever did (8:04 - 8:10)
yeah i just like i would rather them not (8:07 - 8:13)
have an emblem system and just like fix (8:10 - 8:16)
the other things in their game (8:13 - 8:19)
like there are characters that are are (8:16 - 8:20)
still bad (8:19 - 8:22)
there are (8:20 - 8:24)
move sets on character like the (8:22 - 8:26)
character might be good but then it's (8:24 - 8:27)
like (8:26 - 8:29)
this this path that you had like this (8:27 - 8:30)
tree that's splitting off this this (8:29 - 8:32)
branch is completely broken no one's (8:30 - 8:33)
ever going to use it (8:32 - 8:35)
uh everyone's gonna go this way they (8:33 - 8:37)
just did a big they just did a big (8:35 - 8:40)
rework of a bunch of them (8:37 - 8:42)
with this patch so a bunch of things got (8:40 - 8:44)
changed (8:42 - 8:46)
uh and i think (8:44 - 8:46)
i think this gives them more dials to (8:47 - 8:52)
fix that (8:49 - 8:52)
what that like if people (8:53 - 8:57)
jam a bunch of emblems in it yeah the (8:55 - 8:59)
characters suddenly better well i mean i (8:57 - 9:01)
think that gives them more things to (8:59 - 9:04)
dial to make characters (9:01 - 9:06)
unique and for different things (9:04 - 9:08)
i think it's less about balance at this (9:06 - 9:10)
point and finding (9:08 - 9:12)
because a lot of the characters feel (9:10 - 9:15)
samey samey finding ways to (9:12 - 9:16)
make them (9:15 - 9:17)
[Music] (9:16 - 9:19)
stand out in different ways and i think (9:17 - 9:23)
emblems allow them to do that (9:19 - 9:25)
yeah i (9:23 - 9:25)
i will say like the emblems didn't ruin (9:26 - 9:31)
my enjoyment of the game (9:28 - 9:33)
i'm just like they're here and they're i (9:31 - 9:35)
like i don't have enough to do anything (9:33 - 9:37)
optimal right and i played (9:35 - 9:42)
12 hours in the last three days and i (9:37 - 9:44)
don't still don't have enough right like (9:42 - 9:46)
i can't play they're gonna keep you at a (9:44 - 9:48)
master rank (9:46 - 9:50)
um i i don't think so (9:48 - 9:51)
no (9:50 - 9:52)
i think the thing that keeps you out of (9:51 - 9:54)
master rank are just the people that (9:52 - 9:56)
just decide the afk after two minutes of (9:54 - 9:57)
the match yeah that's like what's (9:56 - 9:59)
keeping me out of like there was it was (9:57 - 10:01)
weird too greg because i was playing (9:59 - 10:03)
between like this sweet spot of 2 a.m (10:01 - 10:06)
and 4am and i was like holy cow everyone (10:03 - 10:08)
i'm playing with is great yeah everyone (10:06 - 10:11)
is doing exactly (10:08 - 10:14)
do and all of a sudden like 5am came (10:11 - 10:16)
around and it was nothing but af cares (10:14 - 10:18)
every single match people and i was like (10:16 - 10:21)
what time slot who is awake right what (10:18 - 10:22)
am i playing (10:21 - 10:24)
in japan yeah (10:22 - 10:25)
have you noticed the change in the (10:24 - 10:27)
reporting system (10:25 - 10:30)
um (10:27 - 10:30)
i reported three people for afk one like (10:30 - 10:34)
went through right away and said (10:33 - 10:36)
negative ten (10:34 - 10:38)
and then the other two went like for (10:36 - 10:40)
review and they were they they did short (10:38 - 10:42)
afk they would afk for like a full (10:40 - 10:44)
minute and then start moving and then (10:42 - 10:45)
like afk again (10:44 - 10:46)
because they they were definitely done (10:45 - 10:49)
with the match yeah they would like have (10:46 - 10:51)
you gotten the follow-up emails yet (10:49 - 10:52)
uh-uh (10:51 - 10:53)
so i've reported a bunch of people for (10:52 - 10:56)
idling uh and some said confirming some (10:53 - 10:59)
went through and said correct and then (10:56 - 11:01)
like two days later i got an email (10:59 - 11:03)
saying thank you for reporting them we (11:01 - 11:05)
verified that they were idling we have (11:03 - 11:06)
raised your (11:05 - 11:09)
battle points by x amount to compensate (11:06 - 11:11)
for your poor experience and that seems (11:09 - 11:13)
to be the new norm like if you find (11:11 - 11:15)
somebody who's idling you report it they (11:13 - 11:18)
a reward you for that and adjust that (11:15 - 11:20)
match for you saying yeah you were (11:18 - 11:22)
you're limited so we're going to fix (11:20 - 11:25)
your battle points uh for that change (11:22 - 11:27)
and this happened to be three times now (11:25 - 11:29)
for the reports that i've done which to (11:27 - 11:31)
me is like yeah i still want to report (11:29 - 11:34)
them because i also i also block them (11:31 - 11:35)
because i'm never going to play with you (11:34 - 11:38)
again um but it's nice to get sort of a (11:35 - 11:40)
confirmation saying it was an unfair (11:38 - 11:41)
thing that happened to you we've (11:40 - 11:43)
adjusted (11:41 - 11:45)
where you're at accordingly thank you (11:43 - 11:47)
for playing and trying to make our game (11:45 - 11:49)
better and i appreciate that (11:47 - 11:51)
also what's up with boss rush they like (11:49 - 11:53)
promoted boss rush and like it was like (11:51 - 11:55)
what four eight hours and i like log in (11:53 - 11:57)
like bras rush is over like uh it's (11:55 - 11:59)
coming on a rotation so it's on the it's (11:57 - 12:02)
on the same rotation as the ketchum (11:59 - 12:05)
one where you go through and (12:02 - 12:07)
uh catch the legendaries and then you (12:05 - 12:09)
can become them for a while so it (12:07 - 12:12)
swapped out so bosh rush was like five (12:09 - 12:13)
days (12:12 - 12:15)
and uh ketchum was like five days and (12:13 - 12:17)
then i forget what the next one is and (12:15 - 12:19)
then it'll come back so it's part of the (12:17 - 12:22)
rotation to just (12:19 - 12:24)
keep those things going through as quick (12:22 - 12:27)
battles to let people play those but um (12:24 - 12:29)
i thought (12:27 - 12:30)
bosh rush (12:29 - 12:32)
was the only thing that affected your (12:30 - 12:35)
squad level and it's not so if you're (12:32 - 12:36)
part of a squad (12:35 - 12:38)
and you do anything in the game you get (12:36 - 12:40)
squad points that gives your squads (12:38 - 12:43)
rewards which is really cool (12:40 - 12:46)
what's a squad so squad like a clan in (12:43 - 12:49)
game clan or in a free company (12:46 - 12:51)
a long time ago actually i just don't (12:49 - 12:53)
used it yeah clearly (12:51 - 12:55)
well now there's a slack one that i'm a (12:53 - 12:57)
part of so (12:55 - 12:57)
i get them extra points for being mvp of (12:58 - 13:03)
support which you always know you had a (13:01 - 13:07)
bad game if the mpv was the support (13:03 - 13:08)
yep (13:07 - 13:11)
i (13:08 - 13:11)
i bought the the unite membership (13:13 - 13:19)
i cannot believe you did that i it is so (13:16 - 13:21)
not good (13:19 - 13:23)
it's it's it's bad it's bad and i've (13:21 - 13:24)
said it's bad the only thing is if you (13:23 - 13:27)
play every day you can get the gems for (13:24 - 13:30)
it but everything else is bad i mean (13:27 - 13:32)
this is why steve gets twitch and (13:30 - 13:33)
patreon money so that he can pay for bad (13:32 - 13:34)
decisions (13:33 - 13:37)
okay so uh (13:34 - 13:40)
full disclosure uh the pokemon company (13:37 - 13:41)
reached out to me it was actually (13:40 - 13:42)
nintendo (13:41 - 13:44)
nintendo reached out to me (13:42 - 13:46)
and they said we want to give you a 20 (13:44 - 13:49)
gift card for unite and we want to give (13:46 - 13:52)
you um a gift card for pokemon center (13:49 - 13:55)
and the the concept was like because you (13:52 - 13:57)
customize your character so much and (13:55 - 14:00)
unite this is not true i've bought one (13:57 - 14:02)
twenty dollar outfit day one of the game (14:00 - 14:03)
and i've worn that since because it was (14:02 - 14:05)
twenty dollars all right give it to me i (14:03 - 14:07)
customize all the time i'm in the fancy (14:05 - 14:11)
boy effort right now i'm looking so good (14:07 - 14:12)
um (14:11 - 14:13)
but (14:12 - 14:14)
i (14:13 - 14:16)
i ordered my pokemon center stuff and (14:14 - 14:18)
then i was like you know what i'll use (14:16 - 14:19)
my 20 (14:18 - 14:21)
unite gift card and i will buy the what (14:19 - 14:24)
is it 9.99 i think 10 (14:21 - 14:26)
10 (14:24 - 14:27)
uh 10 (14:26 - 14:29)
battle pass (14:27 - 14:31)
and you you do okay so right now it (14:29 - 14:34)
shows like a venusaur skin (14:31 - 14:36)
it's like venusaur in a sailor outfit (14:34 - 14:38)
you do get that permanently forever (14:36 - 14:41)
although i wonder like (14:38 - 14:43)
what if you don't have venusaur kind of (14:41 - 14:46)
thing like you still get them i have (14:43 - 14:47)
skins for a lot of things that i don't (14:46 - 14:49)
have yeah yeah but like (14:47 - 14:51)
if you don't have venus or that that (14:49 - 14:53)
part of the the memory is useless to you (14:51 - 14:56)
right yeah you get (14:53 - 14:58)
so i'll go through what it is so it's (14:56 - 15:00)
ten dollars a month you get two (14:58 - 15:04)
halloween license trials a week (15:00 - 15:07)
they don't tell you (15:04 - 15:08)
they kind of ins i guess they kind of (15:07 - 15:10)
like they show like a picture of like (15:08 - 15:11)
right now it's like score bunny and i (15:10 - 15:13)
think sylveon maybe (15:11 - 15:15)
yeah which is wild because they're (15:13 - 15:17)
giving sylveon away for free (15:15 - 15:18)
yeah (15:17 - 15:20)
it's so you don't get a pick (15:18 - 15:21)
right (15:20 - 15:24)
you you get two (15:21 - 15:26)
trials a week (15:24 - 15:29)
you do not get to pick what they are (15:26 - 15:31)
um you get a special hollower that was (15:29 - 15:32)
the venusaur you don't get to pick that (15:31 - 15:34)
but you get to see what it is you get (15:32 - 15:36)
the new chat bubbles (15:34 - 15:38)
which i guess is like (15:36 - 15:40)
the only way in a chat that nobody uses (15:38 - 15:42)
right well i mean when you're picking a (15:40 - 15:44)
lane if if (15:42 - 15:46)
it shows that you're the premium person (15:44 - 15:48)
right like because it'll say like i'm (15:46 - 15:50)
picking top lane (15:48 - 15:52)
you get 40 gems free every day and so (15:50 - 15:54)
when we originally talked about this we (15:52 - 15:57)
said that you have to log in like 20 of (15:54 - 16:00)
the 30 days in order for that to like (15:57 - 16:03)
pay for itself or something like so yeah (16:00 - 16:05)
i could have the days wrong but if you (16:03 - 16:07)
if you logged in every day (16:05 - 16:10)
you would get more gems (16:07 - 16:13)
than just buying 10 worth of gems and it (16:10 - 16:15)
is set up where you have to log in to (16:13 - 16:17)
get it it's not if you like miss three (16:15 - 16:20)
days you get to collect 340s it's you (16:17 - 16:22)
have to log in every day (16:20 - 16:24)
and then the last thing (16:22 - 16:27)
um is you you also get 10 off (16:24 - 16:31)
trainer fashion not to be confused with (16:27 - 16:33)
pokemon fashion (16:31 - 16:35)
you don't get any savings off pokemon (16:33 - 16:38)
fashion you get 10 off trainers fashion (16:35 - 16:41)
and since i've bought this pass (16:38 - 16:45)
there has been no new trainer fashion (16:41 - 16:47)
to even buy honestly when i logged in (16:45 - 16:49)
and it said you haven't logged in and (16:47 - 16:50)
like 42 days (16:49 - 16:52)
i was like (16:50 - 16:54)
let's see what they added to the store (16:52 - 16:58)
literally nothing what okay so what am i (16:54 - 16:59)
yeah (16:58 - 17:02)
i buy more socks get all the socks 10 (16:59 - 17:05)
off socks do you already have all the (17:02 - 17:06)
socks (17:05 - 17:09)
no so you can only save the 10 off the (17:06 - 17:12)
trainer fashion within the (17:09 - 17:15)
seven days new things are added to the (17:12 - 17:16)
store (17:15 - 17:20)
so since nothing has been added there is (17:16 - 17:23)
nothing to even buy to save on (17:20 - 17:25)
now there are new pokemon skins that (17:23 - 17:27)
have been added there's a really great (17:25 - 17:29)
azu uh azumarill (17:27 - 17:32)
punk rock skin it's fantastic it's so (17:29 - 17:33)
good (17:32 - 17:37)
um but it's only off trainer fashion not (17:33 - 17:39)
pokemon fashion (17:37 - 17:42)
and fashion is only visible on the (17:39 - 17:45)
screen for a hot second and and because (17:42 - 17:48)
the loading screen is still so bad (17:45 - 17:50)
you can't even click on portraits in (17:48 - 17:52)
time to see other people's (17:50 - 17:54)
cards (17:52 - 17:55)
but i mean (17:54 - 17:56)
you can see your friends cards yeah you (17:55 - 17:59)
can see your friends (17:56 - 17:59)
it's a bad like (18:01 - 18:05)
this is what (18:03 - 18:05)
i don't understand why (18:06 - 18:13)
the like rented oh you also it didn't (18:10 - 18:15)
say in the the the list i was like you (18:13 - 18:18)
also get two (18:15 - 18:18)
um fashion rentals a week for your (18:19 - 18:23)
trainer (18:22 - 18:26)
um but you don't get to pick that either (18:23 - 18:28)
it's it's like these are the rented (18:26 - 18:29)
fashions that you're you're going to be (18:28 - 18:31)
able to get i i think to make this (18:29 - 18:33)
battle pass a little bit better and what (18:31 - 18:35)
i don't understand is if if you're (18:33 - 18:37)
getting like a rental a week (18:35 - 18:41)
i don't need two random you choose (18:37 - 18:44)
rentals a week just give me one i can (18:41 - 18:46)
rent anything for the week and then once (18:44 - 18:47)
that week's over let me run something (18:46 - 18:51)
else because like i wanted to (18:47 - 18:54)
try azumarill and i am the type of toxic (18:51 - 18:55)
player that i want to play a new (18:54 - 18:57)
character in ranked right away without (18:55 - 18:59)
ever testing it right like practices for (18:57 - 19:02)
suckers let me let me just mean this (18:59 - 19:03)
toxic that's just somebody who's playing (19:02 - 19:06)
to have fun (19:03 - 19:08)
which is toxic i only want to play (19:06 - 19:09)
ranked i don't want to play casual i (19:08 - 19:11)
don't want to play practice just get me (19:09 - 19:12)
in (19:11 - 19:16)
i know i'm not the problem (19:12 - 19:16)
but (19:16 - 19:19)
like when i (19:17 - 19:22)
you can i could rent square bunny i (19:19 - 19:24)
could rent gengar i could rent zarina i (19:22 - 19:25)
don't want to rent any of those (19:24 - 19:27)
characters i i have zero interest in (19:25 - 19:30)
playing gengar i like i want i had no (19:27 - 19:33)
way to rent a zoomer roll (19:30 - 19:35)
and it's like as a member now as a prim (19:33 - 19:38)
as a 10 a month membership (19:35 - 19:39)
buyer (19:38 - 19:40)
i (19:39 - 19:42)
my choices are gengar's arena and (19:40 - 19:44)
cinderace i don't (19:42 - 19:47)
this is useless to me (19:44 - 19:47)
you would think (19:47 - 19:50)
that (19:49 - 19:52)
as a membership person or as somebody (19:50 - 19:54)
who's willing to give you money that you (19:52 - 19:56)
would be like hey try out this character (19:54 - 19:58)
you're the type of sucker that would (19:56 - 20:00)
also then buy the character after you go (19:58 - 20:02)
like oh i like it (20:00 - 20:04)
especially in a situation where you're (20:02 - 20:07)
like you added a cool outfit and the (20:04 - 20:09)
outfit convinced me to play the (20:07 - 20:11)
character and now i have no way to play (20:09 - 20:13)
the character without just buying it but (20:11 - 20:16)
i could rent gengar (20:13 - 20:19)
but i don't want to rent gengar (20:16 - 20:22)
it's very (20:19 - 20:24)
don't the membership's not worth it this (20:22 - 20:26)
is what we said before this the stance (20:24 - 20:29)
of this program has not changed you just (20:26 - 20:31)
decided to be a fool (20:29 - 20:32)
you didn't even listen to our own advice (20:31 - 20:34)
the person in this group that plays the (20:32 - 20:36)
most unite tells you not to do it you're (20:34 - 20:39)
like i need you to do it (20:36 - 20:40)
i mean (20:39 - 20:42)
it's not like the the money came out of (20:40 - 20:46)
his own pocket so i mean true so (20:42 - 20:47)
this is pure science for the sake of (20:46 - 20:49)
science (20:47 - 20:50)
yeah you know sometimes when you buy (20:49 - 20:52)
something you're like oh i didn't know i (20:50 - 20:53)
you know when you go to like mcdonald's (20:52 - 20:55)
and you're like (20:53 - 20:55)
let me get a number five and they're (20:56 - 20:59)
like oh i didn't know (20:58 - 21:01)
i didn't know this came with the number (20:59 - 21:03)
five (21:01 - 21:05)
oh this one comes with two slices of (21:03 - 21:07)
cheese well that's surprise and delight (21:05 - 21:08)
gray yeah (21:07 - 21:09)
kind of like me at your birthday lunch (21:08 - 21:11)
where i ordered a salad and she said do (21:09 - 21:13)
you want fries with that yeah that was (21:11 - 21:15)
you realize i just ordered a salad that (21:13 - 21:17)
was the wildest part of that (21:15 - 21:19)
conversation (21:17 - 21:19)
i mean (21:19 - 21:21)
i appreciate that you want to give me (21:19 - 21:25)
fries with my salad i guess (21:21 - 21:25)
i was hoping that the unite membership (21:26 - 21:31)
had some surprise and delight there was (21:29 - 21:35)
no surprises there was no delight (21:31 - 21:35)
i feel like i'm talking to air sometimes (21:37 - 21:41)
united is good though it's fine it's (21:44 - 21:48)
great like i'm having a good time uh (21:45 - 21:50)
climbing the ladder is as frustrating as (21:48 - 21:52)
it always is but i feel like they've (21:50 - 21:55)
taken a lot of steps to help (21:52 - 21:57)
mitigate my frustrations with a few (21:55 - 22:00)
things um and also jesse and i (21:57 - 22:02)
rule bottom lane so if you ever want to (22:00 - 22:04)
play with it just let jessie and i be in (22:02 - 22:05)
bottom lane together i don't care what (22:04 - 22:06)
the rest of you do (22:05 - 22:08)
but we're gonna write climbing the (22:06 - 22:09)
ladder is (22:08 - 22:13)
frustrating in a sense of (22:09 - 22:15)
playing (22:13 - 22:20)
i think it's i think it's it's just so (22:15 - 22:22)
they're they ask for so much (22:20 - 22:23)
and they (22:22 - 22:25)
like they want you to win (22:23 - 22:27)
four (22:25 - 22:27)
to (22:27 - 22:29)
move from like (22:27 - 22:31)
well they they flipped it it used to be (22:29 - 22:32)
like which is the highest now which is (22:31 - 22:34)
just what everyone is panicking they're (22:32 - 22:36)
like how did i jump to ultra fight and (22:34 - 22:38)
fall into ultra one i'm like no they (22:36 - 22:39)
flipped it (22:38 - 22:40)
yeah (22:39 - 22:41)
so like if you wanted to go from like (22:40 - 22:44)
veteran four to veteran three because (22:41 - 22:46)
the lower numbers it's a golf now (22:44 - 22:50)
you you have to win four without losing (22:46 - 22:51)
one (22:50 - 22:53)
and when you lose there is there's like (22:51 - 22:55)
that that protection but when you lose (22:53 - 22:59)
it's like minus 150 or whatever (22:55 - 23:01)
like this huge number (22:59 - 23:03)
and then you're on like a win streak of (23:01 - 23:05)
like five and it's like here's a bonus (23:03 - 23:06)
10 points for being on a win streak of (23:05 - 23:09)
five and you're like i won five in a row (23:06 - 23:10)
[Music] (23:09 - 23:12)
like it's just the grind the grind on (23:10 - 23:16)
the ladder just feels so punishing (23:12 - 23:18)
for what you're doing like i again i (23:16 - 23:19)
ended up playing (23:18 - 23:21)
on my birthday i ended up playing like (23:19 - 23:24)
six hours in a row and i won almost (23:21 - 23:26)
every match besides like the three that (23:24 - 23:29)
had af cares (23:26 - 23:31)
and i just felt like i made no progress (23:29 - 23:33)
i was like i played for six hours and i (23:31 - 23:35)
i climbed from veteran five to veteran (23:33 - 23:36)
one and i was like that's that's all (23:35 - 23:39)
i've accomplished like it's just like (23:36 - 23:40)
mount everest that's harder to get to (23:39 - 23:42)
the top (23:40 - 23:46)
is a huge jump (23:42 - 23:46)
yeah (23:46 - 23:50)
it's a lot of matches it's a lot of time (23:47 - 23:52)
it was like six hours and i really i and (23:50 - 23:53)
i and like i said i really only lost (23:52 - 23:54)
like three (23:53 - 23:56)
three matches and they weren't even (23:54 - 23:57)
because (23:56 - 23:59)
it was it was just four versus five (23:57 - 24:02)
matches we lost frustrating yeah i'm (23:59 - 24:03)
very close to getting the creme brand (24:02 - 24:06)
anniversary skin however (24:03 - 24:08)
that's a grind too jeez (24:06 - 24:12)
a lot for that yeah it's 3 900 cake (24:08 - 24:14)
frostings (24:12 - 24:14)
yeah i i look even after the last 20 (24:15 - 24:20)
minutes we've been talking about unite i (24:19 - 24:22)
do think it's a genuinely fun game i (24:20 - 24:23)
think it's great (24:22 - 24:27)
i think that the i i want to see them do (24:23 - 24:29)
more stuff that brings people back and (24:27 - 24:31)
when i look at the emblem stuff i'm just (24:29 - 24:33)
like this isn't bringing anyone back (24:31 - 24:35)
this is just catering to like you're (24:33 - 24:36)
very (24:35 - 24:40)
maybe maybe they're very small and very (24:36 - 24:42)
maybe the small amount of extremely (24:40 - 24:44)
competitive people who play this game (24:42 - 24:47)
every day appreciate it but (24:44 - 24:50)
i would like to see more players i think (24:47 - 24:52)
bridge that gap into wanting to play (24:50 - 24:54)
more often everything else they did with (24:52 - 24:56)
the first anniversary is the thing they (24:54 - 24:58)
did to bring players back this is the (24:56 - 24:59)
thing they just gave to their (24:58 - 25:01)
competitive community (24:59 - 25:04)
like they were not they were not forward (25:01 - 25:06)
leading very hard with the emblems (25:04 - 25:08)
outside of hey you can collect them (25:06 - 25:10)
here's something fun to collect instead (25:08 - 25:12)
of getting the same outfit 15 times for (25:10 - 25:16)
energy rewards (25:12 - 25:16)
i mean if they added more outfits i (25:16 - 25:19)
could use my membership more i know i (25:17 - 25:20)
could they didn't save that for more (25:19 - 25:22)
outfits (25:20 - 25:25)
i could i could save that ten percent (25:22 - 25:26)
how here's the other thing i don't (25:25 - 25:29)
understand how is the menu okay the (25:26 - 25:33)
menus are bad but how are they so laggy (25:29 - 25:35)
i don't know why their menus are so (25:33 - 25:37)
laggy i've played so many games in the (25:35 - 25:40)
last 30 some years and usually the menus (25:37 - 25:44)
are the the fast thing uh switch (25:40 - 25:47)
hardware is six years seventy years old (25:44 - 25:49)
there's no way it's dependent just on (25:47 - 25:52)
the switch like (25:49 - 25:52)
uh i believe it could be (25:54 - 25:58)
the game runs super smooth once you're (25:59 - 26:03)
in it yeah matches run great i know of (26:00 - 26:05)
the things that i want to be leggy (26:03 - 26:08)
gameplay is always great i do not care (26:05 - 26:09)
about my menus (26:08 - 26:11)
i just don't (26:09 - 26:14)
understand why when i click the store i (26:11 - 26:16)
feel like i'm underwater for a hot (26:14 - 26:18)
second (26:16 - 26:20)
because you're a patient you're a game (26:18 - 26:21)
gobbler it's (26:20 - 26:26)
very jarring hey speaking of underwater (26:21 - 26:28)
uh this is from our attic channel uh (26:26 - 26:30)
tone tone drop this in here uh this is (26:28 - 26:33)

make me laugh every time i look at them (27:08 - 27:12)
on twitter (27:10 - 27:12)
one is intellion literally launching in (27:12 - 27:17)
a chair which is hilarious and the other (27:15 - 27:20)
is intellions standing next to jesus (27:17 - 27:22)

this is what i imagine i hope i'm (27:33 - 27:37)
correct (27:35 - 27:39)
there must be just like a room of like (27:37 - 27:40)
four people (27:39 - 27:42)
that are like which (27:40 - 27:44)
pokemon would we like to be oversized (27:42 - 27:46)

one is next (27:46 - 27:49)
we did the mareep i mean there's a (27:47 - 27:53)
committee absolutely (27:49 - 27:53)
it's always a committee (27:53 - 27:57)
i've been lonely in the morning while i (27:55 - 28:00)
get my cup of coffee it would be nice to (27:57 - 28:04)
have an intelligent watching me poor (28:00 - 28:04)
hey just post his thumb up every day (28:06 - 28:10)
it'd be your daily affirmation you wake (28:08 - 28:12)
up and until he ends in the corner (28:10 - 28:15)
thumbs up good day (28:12 - 28:15)
yeah that's a that's that's a thing 120 (28:15 - 28:22)
seems very cheap though compared to uh (28:18 - 28:23)
it's real thin (28:22 - 28:25)
it's thin there's not a lot it's not a (28:23 - 28:28)
thick boy that marie was 490 it was 500 (28:25 - 28:31)
for that marie you get a ps5 well if you (28:28 - 28:33)
could find a ps5 you could get a ps5 for (28:31 - 28:34)
the price of that marie (28:33 - 28:37)
but the maripo will last longer (28:34 - 28:39)
and the murray backwards compatible (28:37 - 28:43)
[Music] (28:39 - 28:43)
all the way back to gen 2. yeah (28:43 - 28:47)
uh where are we at well let's let's (28:48 - 28:53)
let's take a break (28:51 - 28:57)
uh we have some trading card news some (28:53 - 29:00)
sword and shield news and some pokemon (28:57 - 29:03)
go stuff so we will be right back (29:00 - 29:08)
and we are back from our break um (29:03 - 29:10)
uh let's do the let's do pokemon go (29:08 - 29:11)
stuff (29:10 - 29:12)
uh (29:11 - 29:15)
i i i guess i i this is the part of the (29:12 - 29:19)
episode where i say that uh i i was (29:15 - 29:22)
flown out and hotel (29:19 - 29:24)
paid for put an asterisk there because (29:22 - 29:26)
it was supposed to be paid for but it's (29:24 - 29:28)
hasn't i haven't been reimbursed yet (29:26 - 29:32)
you'll get reimbursed uh by niantic (29:28 - 29:35)
uh so i went out to seattle i look (29:32 - 29:37)
here's the thing is (29:35 - 29:39)
i was gonna go anyways (29:37 - 29:41)
they offered to (29:39 - 29:44)
uh cover my flight at my hotel in return (29:41 - 29:45)
for (29:44 - 29:48)
helping do those raid tours and do we we (29:45 - 29:51)
ran like a gofest ad i think (29:48 - 29:54)
like two episodes ago (29:51 - 29:55)
and then they were like we want you to (29:54 - 29:58)
talk about your experience afterwards so (29:55 - 30:00)
this would be technically a paid part of (29:58 - 30:02)
the show where i talk about my (30:00 - 30:05)
experience although again i would have (30:02 - 30:06)
talked about it anyways because i don't (30:05 - 30:08)
think there's a been an episode of the (30:06 - 30:10)
show where we're like ah let's not talk (30:08 - 30:12)
about pokemon go (30:10 - 30:14)
oh there could be though (30:12 - 30:15)
there could be (30:14 - 30:16)
um (30:15 - 30:19)
i mean i've got some degrees to get out (30:16 - 30:21)
so with those disclaimers out there i do (30:19 - 30:23)
want to thank everyone who (30:21 - 30:26)
came to the raid tours or came to the (30:23 - 30:29)
meet and greets or just said hi (30:26 - 30:31)
um i will say for me (30:29 - 30:34)
who i i did pay my own way to go out to (30:31 - 30:35)
germany (30:34 - 30:38)
and (30:35 - 30:38)
that felt like (30:38 - 30:43)
gosh how do i that actually felt like i (30:41 - 30:45)
was just playing pokemon go (30:43 - 30:47)
where this experience felt like i was (30:45 - 30:49)
working because like i needed to be (30:47 - 30:53)
specific places i mean you were working (30:49 - 30:54)
like yeah i don't know why you would say (30:53 - 30:57)
it felt like it they they made you work (30:54 - 31:00)
i i was working in germany too like i (30:57 - 31:02)
was streaming and like i was for your (31:00 - 31:05)
personal profit not for the big pockets (31:02 - 31:07)
of papa go (31:05 - 31:10)
papa uh john hanke papa niantic papa (31:07 - 31:12)
niantic (31:10 - 31:15)
um so they had they had me do two hours (31:12 - 31:17)
of meet and greets every day from four (31:15 - 31:21)
to six and they they put it on a stage (31:17 - 31:24)
and i'm not a hundred percent sure (31:21 - 31:26)
actually i i am sure how they did meet (31:24 - 31:27)
and greets before because when will and (31:26 - 31:30)
i was in were in chicago and there was (31:27 - 31:32)
like the trainer tips zoe two dots (31:30 - 31:34)
reversal mystic seven meet and greet it (31:32 - 31:35)
was (31:34 - 31:38)
four tenths next to each other (31:35 - 31:40)
and you picked which line you wanted to (31:38 - 31:42)
get into it was very (31:40 - 31:45)
very like comic con or very c2e2 of like (31:42 - 31:47)
walk down the aisle which part which (31:45 - 31:49)
line do you want to wait in and then get (31:47 - 31:51)
in line right (31:49 - 31:53)
and in germany (31:51 - 31:55)
uh i wasn't part of the meet and greet (31:53 - 31:57)
experience thank goodness because i (31:55 - 31:58)
would have probably had one person (31:57 - 31:59)
waiting because then we don't have a (31:58 - 32:01)
very big german audience but we do have (31:59 - 32:02)
some people in germany (32:01 - 32:03)
um (32:02 - 32:07)
they had one big tent in germany and (32:03 - 32:09)
they had one person on each side of the (32:07 - 32:10)
tent (32:09 - 32:12)
so as it was you got you still got in (32:10 - 32:14)
line it was just you were getting in (32:12 - 32:17)
line north east south through us wait (32:14 - 32:20)
isn't reversal european (32:17 - 32:20)
reversal is yes so where are they (32:20 - 32:24)
featured (32:23 - 32:25)
oh (32:24 - 32:29)
okay well that'll do it (32:25 - 32:30)
um (32:29 - 32:33)
in seattle they had four to five (32:30 - 32:37)
creators on a stage and they had one (32:33 - 32:39)
line (32:37 - 32:41)
which i think (32:39 - 32:45)
to me was inconvenient to those people (32:41 - 32:47)
getting in line (32:45 - 32:49)
um (32:47 - 32:49)
because if if somebody (32:50 - 32:54)
let's say you have somebody like zoe two (32:53 - 32:57)
dots or trainer tips (32:54 - 32:58)
or (32:57 - 32:59)
mystic seven right these are really (32:58 - 33:02)
really really big youtubers (32:59 - 33:05)
um and the majority of those lines are (33:02 - 33:07)
for those people and it's like well i (33:05 - 33:09)
just wanna see i just wanna see steve (33:07 - 33:10)
i've never heard of that guy before but (33:09 - 33:12)
i just want to see steve and it's like (33:10 - 33:14)
30 people in front of me are here for (33:12 - 33:15)
zoe (33:14 - 33:17)
and she's taking one to two minutes with (33:15 - 33:18)
a person (33:17 - 33:19)
and (33:18 - 33:21)
there's not i like you know what i mean (33:19 - 33:23)
like i can't (33:21 - 33:25)
i didn't get the choice to pick a line i (33:23 - 33:27)
have to get into one line and the (33:25 - 33:29)
majority of this line is for somebody (33:27 - 33:30)
else and now i'm kind of stuck here i i (33:29 - 33:32)
we had people come up to me and they (33:30 - 33:34)
were like i negotiated with people (33:32 - 33:36)
online saying i was only here to see you (33:34 - 33:37)
so they let me skip like that was (33:36 - 33:39)
happening in the line (33:37 - 33:42)
that's clever (33:39 - 33:42)
and that's that's not anyone's fault (33:42 - 33:47)
except niantic's fault for setting it up (33:44 - 33:49)
then yeah that's a bad that's a bad (33:47 - 33:51)
setup and i think that's i think it's (33:49 - 33:54)
bad for for people who want to see you (33:51 - 33:56)
one because like they have a limited (33:54 - 33:59)
experience in the park they have four (33:56 - 34:00)
hours in the park (33:59 - 34:02)
four hours in the city a one-hour (34:00 - 34:04)
intermission which i think by the way (34:02 - 34:05)
that that was great (34:04 - 34:08)
but if if you're like well i want to see (34:05 - 34:11)
steve and it's a 45 minute wait (34:08 - 34:13)
in the sun (34:11 - 34:15)
you're probably gonna be like (34:13 - 34:16)
maybe not (34:15 - 34:18)
whereas if like the line is pretty short (34:16 - 34:20)
there's only four or five people online (34:18 - 34:22)
you'd be like oh yeah this this will be (34:20 - 34:23)
a nice ten minute break i think there's (34:22 - 34:25)
like a (34:23 - 34:27)
not only is there a (34:25 - 34:29)
respecting your player's time but (34:27 - 34:30)
there's also probably a psychology thing (34:29 - 34:33)
of like lines too long not too good to (34:30 - 34:35)
do it line's short let me hop in real (34:33 - 34:36)
quick (34:35 - 34:38)
um kind of thing (34:36 - 34:40)
but i will say to the people who did (34:38 - 34:41)
wait in line or did show up here's the (34:40 - 34:45)
thing too i told this to my twitch chat (34:41 - 34:45)
certain creators have certain kinds of (34:46 - 34:50)
audiences i think this is this is not (34:48 - 34:51)
for pokemon go this is like for (34:50 - 34:54)
literally anything like d video games (34:51 - 34:56)
whatever this is for anything that's (34:54 - 34:57)
true and (34:56 - 35:00)
when zoe was like a lot of kids (34:57 - 35:03)
uh a lot of um women a lot of young (35:00 - 35:05)
girls like (35:03 - 35:07)
zoey's great she's fantastic (35:05 - 35:09)
and her but you could be like oh that (35:07 - 35:11)
that person definitely looks like a zoe (35:09 - 35:13)
too dusty and right like oh that i bet (35:11 - 35:15)
that person's waiting for zoe (35:13 - 35:17)
and then there was uh there was some (35:15 - 35:18)
other pop there was like the gocass (35:17 - 35:21)
podcast there was a lured up podcast (35:18 - 35:23)
and they (35:21 - 35:26)
i would say that like they're fans and (35:23 - 35:29)
this is this is not a this is not a dig (35:26 - 35:31)
or anything i would say their fans look (35:29 - 35:34)
like the the guys that would (35:31 - 35:36)
after community day like go get some (35:34 - 35:39)
drinks at a bar kind of guys (35:36 - 35:41)
chads (35:39 - 35:41)
is that is that what we're calling them (35:43 - 35:46)
uh (35:45 - 35:47)
i mean that's what i call them (35:46 - 35:51)
yeah we can go with that sure but but le (35:47 - 35:52)
and there's nothing wrong with that (35:51 - 35:53)
right (35:52 - 35:56)
will and i go get barbecue (35:53 - 35:57)
sometimes true (35:56 - 36:00)
sometimes it has been known to happen on (35:57 - 36:02)
multiple occasions yes (36:00 - 36:04)
i find dining experience together we do (36:02 - 36:07)
grumpy's closed (36:04 - 36:09)
i felt my audience (36:07 - 36:10)
was (36:09 - 36:13)
dudes coming up being like (36:10 - 36:16)
here's my husband and then the husband (36:13 - 36:17)
being like (36:16 - 36:19)
my husband loves your show he dragged me (36:17 - 36:22)
to this it's nice to meet you he's been (36:19 - 36:24)
like i had a lot of like (36:22 - 36:27)
just a huge lgbt audience a lot of uh a (36:24 - 36:28)
lot of (36:27 - 36:31)
and your gay stars weren't even there (36:28 - 36:33)
you're breakout gay artists exactly or (36:31 - 36:38)
at home and they originated salt mines (36:33 - 36:41)
these originated gay and we weren't even (36:38 - 36:43)
there (36:41 - 36:43)
it was look the the short of it it was (36:43 - 36:47)
very flattering everyone was really nice (36:45 - 36:49)
we had a community meet up we had like (36:47 - 36:51)
30 32 people come for the community meet (36:49 - 36:53)
up it was nice and you ditched people (36:51 - 36:55)
because you walk too fast (36:53 - 36:58)
it was nice to see (36:55 - 37:00)
people in the slack or the discord like (36:58 - 37:02)
meet each other um and that's like great (37:00 - 37:04)
for me too like finally putting faces (37:02 - 37:07)
uh to names and whatnot (37:04 - 37:11)
uh overall for gofest i do think the (37:07 - 37:14)
splitting the day in half was great (37:11 - 37:16)
although poorly communicated which is (37:14 - 37:20)
some would say niantic specialty uh and (37:16 - 37:22)
probably could have been set up a little (37:20 - 37:24)
bit better (37:22 - 37:27)
and so what i what i (37:24 - 37:30)
had firsthand was people said that they (37:27 - 37:34)
enjoyed the city experience more (37:30 - 37:37)
if they did a raid tour (37:34 - 37:39)
and if somebody said i didn't like the (37:37 - 37:41)
city experience i asked them if they did (37:39 - 37:44)
the raid tour and they said no almost (37:41 - 37:48)
every time probably like 99 of the time (37:44 - 37:50)
and so i think that was i think the rate (37:48 - 37:52)
so i maybe i should explain ray tours (37:50 - 37:54)
what niantic did is (37:52 - 37:55)
you either had city in the morning or (37:54 - 37:57)
city in the afternoon and that was four (37:55 - 37:59)
hours and they took (37:57 - 38:01)
they took a bunch of content creators (37:59 - 38:02)
um (38:01 - 38:05)
and they they paired two sets of content (38:02 - 38:07)
creators together and then they did two (38:05 - 38:08)
ray tours (38:07 - 38:09)
in the morning and then two in the (38:08 - 38:12)
afternoon one would be at the library (38:09 - 38:14)
which is more downtownish in seattle and (38:12 - 38:16)
then one would be at like an art park (38:14 - 38:18)
which is (38:16 - 38:21)
um like closer to the actual (38:18 - 38:23)
go fest (38:21 - 38:26)
and so they ran from either 10 30 to 12 (38:23 - 38:27)
30 (38:26 - 38:29)
or they ran from like i think it was (38:27 - 38:32)
like 2 30 to 4 30 they ran for two hours (38:29 - 38:34)
and the the concept was whether you had (38:32 - 38:36)
a ticket or not you would show up to a (38:34 - 38:38)
raid tour the content creators would (38:36 - 38:40)
lead you (38:38 - 38:42)
around from raid to raid and niantic (38:40 - 38:44)
purposely put more raids in those areas (38:42 - 38:46)
and then you would do a bunch of raids (38:44 - 38:47)
if you had the ticket you could still (38:46 - 38:48)
play go fest you could still catch (38:47 - 38:50)
pokemon they would still have increased (38:48 - 38:51)
shiny odds you would still get your (38:50 - 38:53)
bonuses and then (38:51 - 38:55)
you would be around other people right (38:53 - 38:56)
you would have some sense of direction (38:55 - 38:57)
and it was really cool because it did (38:56 - 38:59)
show you the city right you like when (38:57 - 39:02)
you started at the library (38:59 - 39:03)
like that library is really historic (39:02 - 39:05)
it's a really cool library there's a lot (39:03 - 39:06)
of cool stuff around it and then when (39:05 - 39:07)
you would walk around you would see like (39:06 - 39:10)
downtown seattle and we i think most of (39:07 - 39:11)
the right tours over there led to the (39:10 - 39:13)
pier uh where you would see the ferris (39:11 - 39:16)
wheel and everything (39:13 - 39:16)
but they did such a bad job like (39:16 - 39:21)
promoting and communicating these raid (39:19 - 39:23)
tours where (39:21 - 39:24)
like (39:23 - 39:27)
if you didn't if you're if your playtime (39:24 - 39:29)
was in the city i'm sure there was (39:27 - 39:30)
plenty of people that had a good time (39:29 - 39:31)
but you would just like kind of (39:30 - 39:34)
aimlessly walk around and for those (39:31 - 39:36)
people it probably felt more like (39:34 - 39:37)
a community day (39:36 - 39:40)
than go fest (39:37 - 39:40)
so i do hope they do that in the future (39:40 - 39:45)
because i think (39:42 - 39:47)
i think when somebody spends so much (39:45 - 39:49)
money to fly out to go fest and they (39:47 - 39:50)
have a (39:49 - 39:53)
great time in the however (39:50 - 39:55)
the eight hours that is allotted for go (39:53 - 39:56)
fest there's like that day before and (39:55 - 40:00)
that day after of like what do i do now (39:56 - 40:02)
um and so they could participate in the (40:00 - 40:04)
raid tours and have something to do and (40:02 - 40:06)
meet people and have like some sense of (40:04 - 40:08)
direction or like i would have never (40:06 - 40:09)
came to this part of the city if it (40:08 - 40:11)
wasn't for this (40:09 - 40:13)
um (40:11 - 40:15)
so i think that stuff was great (40:13 - 40:18)
i think the park experience was really (40:15 - 40:19)
good too (40:18 - 40:21)
uh they although although i did hear (40:19 - 40:22)
from people like pokemon were (40:21 - 40:24)
disappearing and that didn't happen in (40:22 - 40:26)
the city and it's like (40:24 - 40:27)
that they're disappearing because you (40:26 - 40:30)
crossed an invisible line and you left (40:27 - 40:32)
like you left the electric garden and (40:30 - 40:34)
you moved into like the cloud sanctuary (40:32 - 40:37)
and because you specifically walked past (40:34 - 40:39)
this like piece of grass (40:37 - 40:41)
you have now flipped the spawns and (40:39 - 40:43)
that's so they still need to do that (40:41 - 40:45)
that was something i complained about in (40:43 - 40:46)
berlin that still happened in the city (40:45 - 40:48)
there was no invisible lines right like (40:46 - 40:49)
you (40:48 - 40:51)
things just spawned yeah whatever showed (40:49 - 40:53)
up showed up yeah you just you just kept (40:51 - 40:54)
walking (40:53 - 40:57)
uh the pokemon center was absolutely (40:54 - 40:58)
insane (40:57 - 41:01)
uh the line for that was (40:58 - 41:03)
probably an hour wait most days just to (41:01 - 41:05)
get plushes the (41:03 - 41:07)
the only like unique thing that they (41:05 - 41:09)
were carrying in stock was the go fest (41:07 - 41:10)
shirt (41:09 - 41:12)
and it sold out by saturday so anyone (41:10 - 41:14)
who was playing on sunday didn't even (41:12 - 41:16)
have a chance to get it (41:14 - 41:18)
uh (41:16 - 41:20)
but i mean like anything else in that (41:18 - 41:21)
story you could have just got off (41:20 - 41:23)
pokemon.com they you know polishes other (41:21 - 41:24)
shirts (41:23 - 41:25)
um (41:24 - 41:27)
pins (41:25 - 41:29)
pillows everything else was pokemon (41:27 - 41:31)
center i guess you get the impulse buy (41:29 - 41:33)
of of that (41:31 - 41:36)
uh they had the pikachu and eevee stuff (41:33 - 41:38)
they had a a tcg area which was actually (41:36 - 41:40)
really cool (41:38 - 41:41)
where you could learn how to play the (41:40 - 41:43)
tcg (41:41 - 41:45)
and they would give you like four free (41:43 - 41:47)
booster packs just waiting in line to (41:45 - 41:49)
like learn how to play um which is which (41:47 - 41:51)
is really cool that was inside the (41:49 - 41:53)
armory (41:51 - 41:55)
they had the um they had this in they (41:53 - 41:57)
they had the trading post and the battle (41:55 - 42:00)
area they had this in germany too um i (41:57 - 42:02)
don't think i explained this in germany (42:00 - 42:04)
but what at least what they did in (42:02 - 42:05)
germany i'm not a hundred percent i'm (42:04 - 42:07)
pretty sure it was the same for seattle (42:05 - 42:09)
what they did is you would wait in line (42:07 - 42:10)
to battle people (42:09 - 42:12)
and then if you won your match you would (42:10 - 42:14)
stay there and they would bring another (42:12 - 42:16)
random person up but if you won three (42:14 - 42:18)
matches in a row you would win a free (42:16 - 42:18)
shirt (42:18 - 42:20)
and then if you didn't win you would (42:18 - 42:21)
just get like a code card for like some (42:20 - 42:23)
raspberries and like an incubator or (42:21 - 42:26)
whatever just for participating (42:23 - 42:29)
could i win a free shirt on sunday (42:26 - 42:30)
i don't even i don't think it was the (42:29 - 42:33)
gofest shirt (42:30 - 42:33)
uh they had they had a campfire booth (42:36 - 42:40)
they had the niantic booth (42:38 - 42:43)
um they had the campfire i don't know (42:40 - 42:44)
what was happening over at campfire but (42:43 - 42:46)
if you showed them you had the campfire (42:44 - 42:48)
app installed they were handing out free (42:46 - 42:49)
water bottles they were handing out (42:48 - 42:51)
popcorn they were handing out like left (42:49 - 42:52)
just just showing they trying to get (42:51 - 42:55)
that rating up yeah (42:52 - 42:57)
um (42:55 - 42:57)
that was (42:58 - 43:02)
the the (42:59 - 43:02)
spaces (43:02 - 43:06)
or sorry the biomes like the electric (43:04 - 43:08)
garden the dream sanctuary the cloud (43:06 - 43:09)
whatever (43:08 - 43:10)
they were (43:09 - 43:13)
the the oasis they were brilliantly (43:10 - 43:15)
designed way better than berlin um (43:13 - 43:18)
probably some of the best (43:15 - 43:22)
spaces they've designed at a gofest (43:18 - 43:25)
for sure the park didn't feel (43:22 - 43:27)
the park felt (43:25 - 43:30)
kind of small but i think it felt small (43:27 - 43:32)
to me in comparison to like (43:30 - 43:35)
the the brits are part garden in germany (43:32 - 43:38)
which was like what happened in that in (43:35 - 43:39)
germany is i would be on one side of the (43:38 - 43:42)
park and i would be like oh a dark (43:39 - 43:44)
darkrai raid spawned (43:42 - 43:46)
oh i can't make it there in 30 minutes (43:44 - 43:48)
because it's gonna take me 45 minutes to (43:46 - 43:50)
walk across this park because that's how (43:48 - 43:52)
big that park was (43:50 - 43:55)
um where this park where was i get to (43:52 - 43:56)
the other side of the park in less than (43:55 - 43:58)
15 minutes (43:56 - 44:00)
kind of thing (43:58 - 44:03)
i don't know if i'm allowed to say this (44:00 - 44:05)
but i did not hear it from my niantic (44:03 - 44:07)
employee i heard it from one of the (44:05 - 44:09)
green shirts which are not niantic (44:07 - 44:11)
employees (44:09 - 44:12)
so i'm i (44:11 - 44:14)
you know (44:12 - 44:16)
it was just people talking (44:14 - 44:17)
but they said (44:16 - 44:21)
that they sold 15 000 tickets in the (44:17 - 44:23)
morning and then another fifteen (44:21 - 44:25)
thousand tickets in the afternoon (44:23 - 44:27)
so that's thirty thousand tickets on (44:25 - 44:29)
saturday which is a good gossip no (44:27 - 44:31)
that's not sold out it's just something (44:29 - 44:33)
awesome (44:31 - 44:34)
uh i don't think niantics is has (44:33 - 44:39)
published those numbers but but but like (44:34 - 44:39)
that's a pretty huge amount of people (44:39 - 44:44)
for saturday and the able the reason (44:42 - 44:47)
they were able to have so many people is (44:44 - 44:48)
because they forced half the people to (44:47 - 44:51)
go into the city (44:48 - 44:52)
because there's no way they would have (44:51 - 44:54)
fit that many people into the park (44:52 - 44:56)
but you just said they sold 15 000 in (44:54 - 44:59)
the morning and 15 000 in the afternoon (44:56 - 45:02)
right so you're in the park (44:59 - 45:04)
only for four of those hours so 15 000 (45:02 - 45:06)
people (45:04 - 45:08)
in the park in the morning then in the (45:06 - 45:10)
afternoon they go into the city and then (45:08 - 45:12)
a new 15 000 people so you're saying the (45:10 - 45:15)
park was big enough for 15 000 people (45:12 - 45:17)
yes but not for 30 000 people which they (45:15 - 45:19)
amount which is technically the amount (45:17 - 45:21)
of tickets they would have sold assuming (45:19 - 45:22)
that those numbers are correct based off (45:21 - 45:24)
the (45:22 - 45:27)
contract niantic employee not the (45:24 - 45:29)
because the niantic employees would be (45:27 - 45:31)
wearing blue shirts the like (45:29 - 45:34)
what are they called like four high like (45:31 - 45:36)
contract rentals (45:34 - 45:39)
right like the rental rental people (45:36 - 45:41)
are (45:39 - 45:43)
what (45:41 - 45:46)
just just (45:43 - 45:46)
contractors yeah contractors right (45:48 - 45:52)
yeah (45:51 - 45:55)
yeah that's what this other uh what else (45:52 - 45:57)
you were all saying because that was the (45:55 - 45:58)
wildest (45:57 - 46:00)
few seconds of my life i was leading him (45:58 - 46:02)
down a dark path that's all i wanted to (46:00 - 46:03)
do (46:02 - 46:05)
how many of them had shirts that said uh (46:03 - 46:08)
use me were for wi-fi (46:05 - 46:10)
excuse me (46:08 - 46:10)
so um (46:12 - 46:17)
yeah i mean that's a lot of people for (46:15 - 46:20)
sure i mean the saturday event sold out (46:17 - 46:23)
the other complaint i had (46:20 - 46:25)
and this is such a i get why they did it (46:23 - 46:28)
but it sucks at the same time (46:25 - 46:30)
because there was a morning ticket and (46:28 - 46:33)
an afternoon ticket you could not trade (46:30 - 46:36)
with the opposite ticket holder (46:33 - 46:40)
so if i had i had technically afternoon (46:36 - 46:42)
in the park because my raid tours were (46:40 - 46:45)
in the city in the morning right (46:42 - 46:47)
so when people came up to the meet and (46:45 - 46:49)
greet they would be like oh we're lucky (46:47 - 46:51)
friends can we trade i'm like yeah sure (46:49 - 46:52)
of course (46:51 - 46:54)
like the group perfect i don't have to (46:52 - 46:56)
go to the the trade area let's do it (46:54 - 46:57)
right now (46:56 - 46:58)
and they would have (46:57 - 47:00)
morning in the park and i had afternoon (46:58 - 47:01)
in the park (47:00 - 47:05)
so it would lock the trade out (47:01 - 47:06)
and the reason they did that is because (47:05 - 47:09)
they didn't want people (47:06 - 47:12)
to stay in the park when they were (47:09 - 47:14)
supposed to be in the city which makes (47:12 - 47:16)
sense (47:14 - 47:18)
but also you're you're literally cutting (47:16 - 47:22)
your amounts of amount of trades in half (47:18 - 47:24)
like if if there were thirty 000 people (47:22 - 47:26)
i could have traded with (47:24 - 47:27)
you're you're literally telling me i can (47:26 - 47:29)
only trade with 15 000 (47:27 - 47:31)
and let's hope that the person i needed (47:29 - 47:33)
to trade with bought the same ticket as (47:31 - 47:35)
me because that wasn't communicated at (47:33 - 47:36)
all (47:35 - 47:38)
like it really (47:36 - 47:40)
like that in itself was a bummer (47:38 - 47:42)
um (47:40 - 47:44)
and then (47:42 - 47:45)
i don't know if it's because i had like (47:44 - 47:47)
a special niantic ticket but i know for (47:45 - 47:49)
sure on (47:47 - 47:53)
friday i only did five trades (47:49 - 47:55)
and so i should have still had trades (47:53 - 47:57)
after the event ended (47:55 - 47:58)
because you're supposed to get like (47:57 - 48:00)
season of go you're supposed to get like (47:58 - 48:01)
two trades a day because i think it was (48:00 - 48:04)
six trades (48:01 - 48:05)
in the park either way i should have had (48:04 - 48:07)
at least one trade and (48:05 - 48:09)
after the go fest ended it was like oh (48:07 - 48:12)
you still you still can't trade (48:09 - 48:13)
so that was a kind of a bummer because (48:12 - 48:14)
it was like oh maybe after like the park (48:13 - 48:16)
is closed we can trade and that it still (48:14 - 48:19)
didn't work (48:16 - 48:21)
but on sunday it worked where i did my (48:19 - 48:23)
two special trades before go fest (48:21 - 48:24)
started (48:23 - 48:26)
and then during gofest i had all my (48:24 - 48:28)
trades but i was (48:26 - 48:31)
it was like it was locked to like oh we (48:28 - 48:34)
have opposite tickets can't trade at all (48:31 - 48:35)
i guess i'll see you in six months or (48:34 - 48:37)
eight months or whenever the next go (48:35 - 48:39)
fest is (48:37 - 48:39)
uh so that that was that was a bit of a (48:40 - 48:45)
bummer (48:42 - 48:45)
um (48:45 - 48:47)
but yeah i (48:46 - 48:48)
i had a great time i thought it was (48:47 - 48:50)
worth it (48:48 - 48:52)
i (48:50 - 48:52)
i i know there was (48:54 - 48:57)
i know when i stream it on twitch people (48:56 - 48:58)
are like man i wish i could have a (48:57 - 49:00)
three-day ticket i ended up walking 30 (48:58 - 49:02)
miles that weekend and i was very (49:00 - 49:04)
exhausted (49:02 - 49:07)
i i don't (49:04 - 49:07)
i said this with germany i think i think (49:07 - 49:14)
a three-day ticket kind of ruins the (49:10 - 49:14)
the feel of that and i think it's kind (49:14 - 49:19)
of similar to like the two-day eevee (49:17 - 49:20)
community day (49:19 - 49:23)
where it didn't feel that (49:20 - 49:25)
special because it was like oh well (49:23 - 49:27)
whatever we still have tomorrow to catch (49:25 - 49:31)
like our 70th shiny eevee like no big (49:27 - 49:32)
deal (49:31 - 49:35)
but i think i think just (49:32 - 49:35)
the heat and the walking and the playing (49:35 - 49:40)
is just very very exhausting although um (49:38 - 49:42)
one of my mods (49:40 - 49:44)
uh steel she said like i would like to (49:42 - 49:46)
have a three-day pass not to play eight (49:44 - 49:48)
hours every day but to like (49:46 - 49:51)
play a couple hours each day right and i (49:48 - 49:54)
was like yeah that that does make sense (49:51 - 49:55)
um (49:54 - 49:57)
but that's where i think niantic needs (49:55 - 49:59)
to fill in the gaps (49:57 - 50:01)
of like here is your go fest experience (49:59 - 50:03)
on your selected day and here is (50:01 - 50:06)
something to do (50:03 - 50:06)
in the city (50:06 - 50:10)
on the days you're not playing (50:08 - 50:12)
and i i do feel like they have to (50:10 - 50:13)
somewhere (50:12 - 50:15)
they're ki and they're kind of getting (50:13 - 50:17)
there with like dark cry and cresselia (50:15 - 50:19)
were only in the seattle area and they (50:17 - 50:21)
did the right tours i i think there (50:19 - 50:23)
needs to be a little bit more maybe like (50:21 - 50:26)
in that city there is (50:23 - 50:27)
um (50:26 - 50:29)
like special you know what they did in (50:27 - 50:32)
dc will where like in dc you could like (50:29 - 50:35)
get specific research only in dc and (50:32 - 50:38)
they were like aerodactyls or (50:35 - 50:41)
relicanths for the world championship (50:38 - 50:43)
sure (50:41 - 50:43)
you know (50:43 - 50:45)
i don't remember you're at (50:43 - 50:47)
i mean i remember getting the relicanths (50:45 - 50:49)
yes yeah yeah yeah remember there was (50:47 - 50:51)
the sweet [ __ ] raid hour or whatever (50:49 - 50:52)
yeah yeah yeah yeah but they walked all (50:51 - 50:55)
around and did those the stops in dc (50:52 - 50:58)
were specific to get relicanth or to get (50:55 - 50:59)
aerodactyl (50:58 - 51:01)
so i feel like if they did something (50:59 - 51:02)
like that (51:01 - 51:04)
which encourages people to go out spin (51:02 - 51:06)
stops do that research but it's only in (51:04 - 51:08)
seattle or wherever they pick for the (51:06 - 51:10)
next go fest (51:08 - 51:12)
i i think they need to (51:10 - 51:15)
kind of make this a weekend event (51:12 - 51:16)
especially if somebody's spending eight (51:15 - 51:18)
hundred dollars to fly across the united (51:16 - 51:21)
states when it's a destination event yes (51:18 - 51:23)
yeah (51:21 - 51:24)
i and i think they're getting there i (51:23 - 51:26)
think like (51:24 - 51:29)
as as much as niantic does things wrong (51:26 - 51:32)
and makes people upset and very bad at (51:29 - 51:33)
communication (51:32 - 51:35)
they're so good at live events they are (51:33 - 51:38)
so good at like once you get there for (51:35 - 51:41)
go fest it's incredible (51:38 - 51:43)
and it's just like everything or the (51:41 - 51:46)
rapper around it is like terrible this (51:43 - 51:48)
is why i left acting the live events (51:46 - 51:50)
were great i hated the wrapper around it (51:48 - 51:53)
yeah (51:50 - 51:55)
um (51:53 - 51:55)
yeah just like big (51:55 - 52:00)
big thank you to like anyone who who (51:58 - 52:02)
came up and said hi or did raid tours (52:00 - 52:06)
with us or took pictures or there was (52:02 - 52:09)
like this this um younger girl and she (52:06 - 52:11)
brought me these little chunks those (52:09 - 52:13)
things are so cute they were absolutely (52:11 - 52:14)
adorable (52:13 - 52:14)
um (52:14 - 52:16)
[Music] (52:14 - 52:18)
and she was great and and her dad was (52:16 - 52:19)
great (52:18 - 52:21)
um yeah there was just like there was a (52:19 - 52:22)
lot that happened (52:21 - 52:23)
that (52:22 - 52:26)
it was totally worth it whether niantic (52:23 - 52:29)
paid for me or or not it was but i will (52:26 - 52:30)
say like because somebody asked me they (52:29 - 52:31)
were like was it better or worse than (52:30 - 52:33)
germany and i was like they were so (52:31 - 52:35)
different experiences (52:33 - 52:36)
um (52:35 - 52:38)
like being in a huge park for eight (52:36 - 52:41)
hours versus being in a smaller park and (52:38 - 52:43)
then being forced in the city (52:41 - 52:45)
then being forced sounds like it was bad (52:43 - 52:47)
like i did enjoy the city experience a (52:45 - 52:48)
lot (52:47 - 52:48)
um (52:48 - 52:52)
just very very different vibes and i do (52:48 - 52:55)
absolutely love the hour break i think (52:52 - 52:57)
the hour break is is something i wish (52:55 - 52:59)
happened in germany (52:57 - 53:01)
because again you you do still have that (52:59 - 53:03)
like fear of like oh i i should be (53:01 - 53:04)
catching or i should be doing these (53:03 - 53:06)
raids i think like forcing people to be (53:04 - 53:08)
like (53:06 - 53:11)
delete some pokemon do a couple trades (53:08 - 53:12)
granted you have the right ticket as (53:11 - 53:15)
everyone else to do the trades like (53:12 - 53:17)
get something to eat (53:15 - 53:19)
maybe like change your shoes like that (53:17 - 53:21)
hour break is really really great and i (53:19 - 53:22)
know like somebody's like well you could (53:21 - 53:25)
just make the hour break yourself (53:22 - 53:28)
i think niantic being in charge of that (53:25 - 53:30)
and saying like (53:28 - 53:32)
promoting like our game is active be (53:30 - 53:34)
healthy also we want you outside in the (53:32 - 53:38)
sun for eight hours like i think niantic (53:34 - 53:39)
needs to be in charge of it because i (53:38 - 53:41)
think at the end of the day that the day (53:39 - 53:43)
they are responsible for curating an (53:41 - 53:45)
experience (53:43 - 53:47)
and i think by for like telling your (53:45 - 53:50)
audience go eat something and relax (53:47 - 53:52)
makes the next four hours just a better (53:50 - 53:54)
experience for everyone (53:52 - 53:58)
because when i was in chicago with will (53:54 - 53:59)
we got lunch (53:58 - 54:02)
because we were hungry and other people (53:59 - 54:03)
with us (54:02 - 54:05)
did not get lunch because they cared (54:03 - 54:07)
about chinese more and they were not fun (54:05 - 54:10)
to talk to in the next four hours (54:07 - 54:12)
because they did not eat (54:10 - 54:15)
uh and that was not a great experience (54:12 - 54:17)
for me or will because like um you know (54:15 - 54:18)
we're trying to be (54:17 - 54:19)
we're trying to (54:18 - 54:22)
enjoy the rest of our day (54:19 - 54:22)
also last thing last thing it was wild (54:23 - 54:27)
to see (54:26 - 54:28)
uh (54:27 - 54:31)
there i did have a lot of younger people (54:28 - 54:33)
come up um (54:31 - 54:35)
and it was wild to see that they would (54:33 - 54:37)
only be like i only caught two shinies (54:35 - 54:39)
today only caught three shinies today (54:37 - 54:41)
and they were still like they were over (54:39 - 54:42)
the moon excited (54:41 - 54:44)
like one one kid i talked to i was like (54:42 - 54:46)
you getting chinese today he was like (54:44 - 54:47)
just one i was like oh cool what'd you (54:46 - 54:49)
get it was like dark cry i love them (54:47 - 54:51)
favor like my new favorite pokemon it (54:49 - 54:54)
was very like humbling to see like (54:51 - 54:56)
it was it was almost like a jarring to (54:54 - 54:57)
be like (54:56 - 55:00)
somebody come up and they were like (54:57 - 55:02)
i only got 13 shinies i don't think this (55:00 - 55:04)
was worth the 25 and then you get like a (55:02 - 55:06)
kid being like i got one chinese this is (55:04 - 55:08)
my favorite day ever (55:06 - 55:09)
the weight of the world has not yet (55:08 - 55:14)
crushed that child give it time (55:09 - 55:16)
all that it takes for that child to turn (55:14 - 55:18)
into that other person is time and an (55:16 - 55:22)
understanding of how money works (55:18 - 55:22)
they're having a great time like i (55:22 - 55:25)
enjoyed a lot of things but i didn't (55:24 - 55:28)
have to pay for it (55:25 - 55:30)
very true (55:28 - 55:30)
um (55:31 - 55:34)
yeah hopefully uh (55:34 - 55:38)
hopefully niantic does more live events (55:38 - 55:43)
and they they (55:41 - 55:46)
they end up being as good for uh (55:43 - 55:48)
for the game (55:46 - 55:51)
hey speaking of uh pokemon go (55:48 - 55:54)
there's a community ambassador program (55:51 - 55:56)
that is launching (55:54 - 55:59)
uh which (55:56 - 56:00)
it says what does this is up (55:59 - 56:03)
pokemongolive.com what does a community (56:00 - 56:05)
ambassador do it is somebody who (56:03 - 56:07)
voluntarily runs their events in the (56:05 - 56:09)
local community with the gratitude and (56:07 - 56:11)
assistance of niantic (56:09 - 56:14)
niantic recognizes how much passion and (56:11 - 56:15)
hard work it takes to bring people (56:14 - 56:18)
together this program is built to help (56:15 - 56:21)
leaders do that (56:18 - 56:22)
they're looking for diversity (56:21 - 56:25)
professionalism positivity safety (56:22 - 56:27)
integrity (56:25 - 56:27)
uh what do you receive for being part of (56:28 - 56:31)
the community ambassador program you (56:30 - 56:34)

niantic (56:40 - 56:43)
one-on-one opportunities to learn more (56:41 - 56:45)
about us (56:43 - 56:46)
um (56:45 - 56:48)
how do i become a community ambassador (56:46 - 56:51)
they use the self-road level and ranking (56:48 - 56:53)
system i don't actually know what that (56:51 - 56:56)
is i know self-road has something to (56:53 - 56:59)
make a player profile and (56:56 - 57:00)
i know there's like they have their own (56:59 - 57:02)
meetups (57:00 - 57:04)
somebody asked me if i had a silph road (57:02 - 57:07)
profile at my meet up i was like no (57:04 - 57:09)
i got that (57:07 - 57:11)
[Music] (57:09 - 57:14)
um yeah so this is (57:11 - 57:16)
this reminds me a lot of like the (57:14 - 57:21)
professor program for play pokemon (57:16 - 57:23)
uh the professor program you have to (57:21 - 57:26)
take like this impossible quiz where (57:23 - 57:28)
it's like well clearly not impossible (57:26 - 57:30)
because many people pass it but yeah (57:28 - 57:31)
it's a difficult quiz (57:30 - 57:35)
if if luxury level x has 18 damage (57:31 - 57:37)
counters on it and is versing charizard (57:35 - 57:42)
with the prime with the pokey body (57:37 - 57:43)
flame (57:42 - 57:45)
synergy (57:43 - 57:46)
what (57:45 - 57:47)
card (57:46 - 57:49)
it's like that's like the (57:47 - 57:50)
it's like one of those like if two (57:49 - 57:55)
trains leave at the same time it's like (57:50 - 57:55)
this on the other hand yeah so if you're (57:55 - 57:58)
part of the professor program that like (57:57 - 58:00)
the pokemon company would send you like (57:58 - 58:04)
posters and pins and and cards that (58:00 - 58:05)
you're supposed to give out at like play (58:04 - 58:07)
pokemon (58:05 - 58:09)
events or um what are they called like (58:07 - 58:13)
leagues like a local like a local league (58:09 - 58:15)
um so this seems very similar in the (58:13 - 58:16)
sense of (58:15 - 58:18)
um (58:16 - 58:20)
that for pokemon go (58:18 - 58:21)
there's they still do that thing at (58:20 - 58:23)

2. (59:34 - 59:38)
uh (59:36 - 59:40)
what are the bonuses we got three times (59:38 - 59:42)
the catch stardust two times for (59:40 - 59:44)
catching pokemon (59:42 - 59:47)
uh two times for catching uh (59:44 - 59:50)
two times chance for trainers level 31 (59:47 - 59:53)
and above to receive xl candy (59:50 - 59:55)
three hour lure modules three hour (59:53 - 59:56)
incense (59:55 - 59:58)
snapshot surprises one additional (59:56 - 60:01)
special trade for maximum of three (59:58 - 60:04)
trades will last five hours will be (60:01 - 60:07)
fifty percent less stardust (60:04 - 60:07)
the bonus this time (60:08 - 60:12)
will be if enough trainers (60:10 - 60:13)
uh (60:12 - 60:16)
catch pokemon near a single lower module (60:13 - 60:18)
three times the stardust bonus for (60:16 - 60:19)
catching (60:18 - 60:22)
will be increased to four times the (60:19 - 60:24)
amount for 30 minutes (60:22 - 60:26)
this bonus will not stack with the base (60:24 - 60:28)
three times stardust this is actually (60:26 - 60:30)
kind of a nerf (60:28 - 60:31)
so i don't know if you guys heard the (60:30 - 60:33)
drama here (60:31 - 60:35)
so the drama was (60:33 - 60:38)
instead of the four times bonus stardust (60:35 - 60:39)
it was supposed to be (60:38 - 60:41)
spawning (60:39 - 60:44)
gallery (60:41 - 60:44)
spawning for dino sure and then people (60:47 - 60:50)
complained (60:49 - 60:53)
that zweiless was (60:50 - 60:55)
nerfing (60:53 - 60:58)
the dino spawns (60:55 - 61:02)
because you would see zwielus not dino (60:58 - 61:04)
now you're like but where what what this (61:02 - 61:06)
sounds better what's the problem (61:04 - 61:07)
well (61:06 - 61:10)
lying on would give you way more (61:07 - 61:11)
stardust (61:10 - 61:14)
than zigzagoon and because you're (61:11 - 61:17)
already getting a three times stardust (61:14 - 61:19)
bonus (61:17 - 61:21)
you would by catching lioneum you would (61:19 - 61:24)
be you would get way more stardust than (61:21 - 61:29)
four times stardust on zigzagoon (61:24 - 61:33)
so that's where like the nerf comes in (61:29 - 61:33)
here (61:36 - 61:39)
let's just (61:40 - 61:45)
get a straw and suck all the joy (61:41 - 61:48)
out of playing games (61:45 - 61:51)
we have to take everything and turn it (61:48 - 61:54)
into a math problem or else you're not (61:51 - 61:56)
doing it right (61:54 - 61:57)
well you know as (61:56 - 62:00)

yep (67:19 - 67:22)
i just for me for (67:20 - 67:25)
when it was six i didn't feel rushed in (67:22 - 67:28)
the morning correct if it was six i (67:25 - 67:31)
could go next saturday (67:28 - 67:31)
aren't you are you you're driving down (67:32 - 67:36)
to gen con that day right (67:34 - 67:37)
yeah he'll be yeah (67:36 - 67:40)
you'll be obviously no so next weekend (67:37 - 67:42)
i'll be checked (67:40 - 67:44)
the community day my oh (67:42 - 67:46)
that's right uh the memorial for my (67:44 - 67:48)
cousin is (67:46 - 67:50)
the truth (67:48 - 67:52)
the true offense is if you are a (67:50 - 67:55)
listener of this program who has gone so (67:52 - 67:58)
far as to ask me to be your friend in (67:55 - 68:00)
pokemon go (67:58 - 68:04)
and you are proximate to enough to me (68:00 - 68:07)
that i can see you are in a raid (68:04 - 68:08)
not remote (68:07 - 68:12)
but you are in a raid that i am in (68:08 - 68:14)
and you don't come over and say hello (68:12 - 68:17)
rude that's how you get deleted from my (68:14 - 68:18)
friend's list (68:17 - 68:20)
[Music] (68:18 - 68:22)
all right (68:20 - 68:22)
i'm more shocked that you're doing raids (68:23 - 68:27)
well now i was only doing them because (68:25 - 68:28)
you were standing right next to me (68:27 - 68:31)
forcing me to do them (68:28 - 68:34)
it was the the the starly and we were (68:31 - 68:36)
all right we got to see if it really (68:34 - 68:38)
extends it (68:36 - 68:38)
saturday the 13th you need to help me (68:43 - 68:48)
make things happen i'm still 100 sure (68:45 - 68:50)
this could probably be solved with a a (68:48 - 68:53)
google search possibly but when when (68:50 - 68:55)
when we did the starly raid because i (68:53 - 68:57)
did make will and greg do it with me (68:55 - 68:59)
they they we were at mall of america for (68:57 - 69:01)
starlight community right (68:59 - 69:03)
and (69:01 - 69:04)
uh (69:03 - 69:06)
the thing happened that we thought was (69:04 - 69:08)
going to happen the first time which was (69:06 - 69:10)
dino which (69:08 - 69:12)
i was like (69:10 - 69:13)
what if dino community ends and then (69:12 - 69:16)
there's no raids for us to do (69:13 - 69:17)
and that literally happened and it (69:16 - 69:18)
happened (69:17 - 69:20)
and then all the raids were like 30 (69:18 - 69:22)
minutes and greg and i were like (69:20 - 69:24)
no you don't want to wait 30 minutes (69:22 - 69:27)
like it's hot out (69:24 - 69:28)
like we're going to pride weekend i was (69:27 - 69:30)
heading to the park (69:28 - 69:32)
and so starly (69:30 - 69:35)
when the when the community ended the (69:32 - 69:37)
raids popped with like five minute (69:35 - 69:40)
timers and we're like great five minutes (69:37 - 69:40)
cool (69:40 - 69:42)
we can see the eggs we can walk to the (69:40 - 69:44)
eggs we can get ready (69:42 - 69:46)
and then we did it and then it worked (69:44 - 69:48)
yeah we did the raid and then all of a (69:46 - 69:49)
sudden there was a bunch of starlies and (69:48 - 69:50)
i got like two shiny starleys like (69:49 - 69:53)
immediately after like they popped and i (69:50 - 69:55)
was like this is this is great this is a (69:53 - 69:57)
great experience and then i did another (69:55 - 69:59)
one (69:57 - 70:02)
and i this is the part i'm confused (69:59 - 70:04)
does it does it add to it because i felt (70:02 - 70:07)
like i had starly's for like (70:04 - 70:10)
45 minutes not like (70:07 - 70:12)
i because you're supposed to do it and (70:10 - 70:13)
then it gives you 30 minutes (70:12 - 70:15)
and then within like five minutes of (70:13 - 70:18)
doing it i did another one (70:15 - 70:20)
so did that time add together (70:18 - 70:23)
i got it i think each one activated its (70:20 - 70:25)
own 30 minute time frame yeah around (70:23 - 70:28)
that pokestop because it felt like to me (70:25 - 70:30)
like oh this was more than 30 minutes (70:28 - 70:32)
and i'm still seeing starly's but also (70:30 - 70:35)
then like why would you do one so close (70:32 - 70:38)
because you wouldn't yeah (70:35 - 70:39)
but they were they were responding till (70:38 - 70:41)
seven they're like i when i got home i (70:39 - 70:44)
saw starabia raids still and i was like (70:41 - 70:46)
oh i went down the street and did that (70:44 - 70:48)
for arabia i'd find more starley and i (70:46 - 70:49)
was like i don't want to leave because (70:48 - 70:51)
if there's anything i don't need how (70:49 - 70:53)
many more stars do you need right right (70:51 - 70:56)
there was a thought at least (70:53 - 70:58)
all right let's take a quick break uh (70:56 - 70:59)
and then we have just (70:58 - 71:01)
well look it's been like we still got (70:59 - 71:02)
question of the week in pokemon of the (71:01 - 71:04)

bait (72:09 - 72:12)
they're trying to get you to empty out (72:11 - 72:14)

um this is all pokemon.com as well (72:24 - 72:31)
register to battle in the i choose chew (72:27 - 72:33)
online competition (72:31 - 72:36)
uh if you're still playing pokemon sword (72:33 - 72:39)
and shield the upcoming i choose 2 (72:36 - 72:41)
online competitions you can register if (72:39 - 72:43)

50 battle points you can register now (72:43 - 72:49)
until august 11th (72:45 - 72:49)
the competition will take place on (72:49 - 72:55)
august 11th and we'll go to the 14th (72:51 - 72:56)
um (72:55 - 72:58)
everything that's weekend (72:56 - 73:02)
i just pile it up what's gonna be next (72:58 - 73:02)
meeting today this battle (73:02 - 73:09)
uh the rules here are you gotta use uh (73:06 - 73:12)
pikachu a raichu a pichu or an alolan (73:09 - 73:14)
raichu (73:12 - 73:17)
um your team can only consist of those (73:14 - 73:20)
so (73:17 - 73:20)
so you can't have a team of six (73:22 - 73:26)
i believe you can only have a team of (73:24 - 73:27)
four i believe it's only those four (73:26 - 73:29)
you're allowed to use (73:27 - 73:30)
well (73:29 - 73:32)
alolan raichu doesn't knock out raichu (73:30 - 73:34)
it's not an either or (73:32 - 73:35)
because then that would be a team of (73:34 - 73:37)
three (73:35 - 73:38)
uh (73:37 - 73:40)
they both have the same pokedex number (73:38 - 73:42)
you would think that pokemon.com would (73:40 - 73:46)
be more clear but here we are (73:42 - 73:46)
according to serbia the those are the (73:48 - 73:53)
only four pokemon you're allowed to (73:51 - 73:58)
pick it is a single battle not double (73:53 - 73:58)
so i'm going to assume that you can have (73:59 - 74:03)
a team of three (74:00 - 74:03)
is it singles or doubles (74:04 - 74:10)
it's single single oh okay yeah it is (74:07 - 74:12)
single (74:10 - 74:12)
uh team of three to six pokemon from (74:13 - 74:18)
level 100 all pokemon will be set to 50. (74:15 - 74:20)
yeah i (74:18 - 74:21)
i don't think (74:20 - 74:23)
well i guess it's their own rules so you (74:21 - 74:26)
could probably bring both (74:23 - 74:26)
well also if they say three to six (74:26 - 74:30)
pokemon does that mean i can have six (74:27 - 74:31)
write you (74:30 - 74:32)
just like (74:31 - 74:33)
i (74:32 - 74:35)
i yeah i don't know (74:33 - 74:38)
i don't know (74:35 - 74:38)
and i'm assuming you'd like you would (74:39 - 74:45)
bring gigantomax pikachu (74:41 - 74:48)
doesn't say you can't check antimax (74:45 - 74:50)
i would assume i know the reward here (74:48 - 74:52)
sucks by the way (74:50 - 74:55)
yeah it can be a gigantic max pikachu or (74:52 - 74:58)
something i i think the thing that i i (74:55 - 75:01)
saw on the comments is to the tweet when (74:58 - 75:02)
this was tweeted is a bunch of people (75:01 - 75:04)
being like i wish i had a light ball (75:02 - 75:06)
which there was a point where people (75:04 - 75:08)
didn't get light balls like why isn't (75:06 - 75:10)
the reward just like here's a pikachu (75:08 - 75:12)
holding a light ball like (75:10 - 75:13)
yeah it sucks you didn't have it for the (75:12 - 75:15)
competition but (75:13 - 75:16)
if you want pikachu to be competitive (75:15 - 75:19)
you kind of need to have a light ball on (75:16 - 75:21)
him (75:19 - 75:24)
um (75:21 - 75:24)
i i just i as much as i like these like (75:24 - 75:28)
really clever (75:26 - 75:31)
cutesy whatever competitions (75:28 - 75:33)
they really gotta (75:31 - 75:35)
it doesn't have to be a shiny pikachu or (75:33 - 75:37)
it does it's just just having like your (75:35 - 75:39)
reward is a pikachu thanks for (75:37 - 75:41)
participating in the chew competition (75:39 - 75:43)
like put a little ribbon on it call it a (75:41 - 75:45)
day (75:43 - 75:45)
put it in a friend ball or something (75:45 - 75:48)
call it a day like (75:46 - 75:52)
it doesn't have to be (75:48 - 75:52)
anything is better than 50 battle points (75:53 - 75:57)
at this point (75:55 - 75:58)
yeah especially because that store is (75:57 - 76:00)
going to be closing up in about three (75:58 - 76:02)
months four months yeah and all your bad (76:00 - 76:05)

leave (77:46 - 77:49)
creep it real the call's coming from (77:47 - 77:51)
inside the house i know (77:49 - 77:54)
with a surprise that lasts longer than (77:51 - 77:56)
candy by merging the magic of pokemon (77:54 - 77:58)
with the delight of thrills and chills (77:56 - 78:01)
for halloween the pokemon tcg trick or (77:58 - 78:01)
trade (78:01 - 78:04)
booster bundle will be available on (78:01 - 78:06)
september 1st (78:04 - 78:09)
at the pokemon center and where pokemon (78:06 - 78:13)
tcg products are sold (78:09 - 78:16)
so to explain this article did no job (78:13 - 78:18)
explaining what you're buying you are (78:16 - 78:20)
you are buying (78:18 - 78:23)
40 booster packs (78:20 - 78:26)
each booster pack containing three cards (78:23 - 78:28)
so ultimately these are like the dollar (78:26 - 78:29)
store packs (78:28 - 78:31)
and that you're supposed to give them (78:29 - 78:35)
out to children for halloween instead of (78:31 - 78:37)
candy yes which which is actually really (78:35 - 78:40)
clever and really cute and really great (78:37 - 78:43)
but if they're (78:40 - 78:45)
how much are they gonna like (78:43 - 78:47)
candy is already expensive (78:45 - 78:48)
i would argue pokemon cards probably (78:47 - 78:51)
more expensive than candy (78:48 - 78:53)
if it's 40 mini booster packs and this (78:51 - 78:55)
was technically dollar store booster (78:53 - 78:57)
packs is that not just going to be 40 (78:55 - 78:59)
bucks (78:57 - 79:01)
they don't tell you what the msrp is (78:59 - 79:02)
they don't (79:01 - 79:05)
um (79:02 - 79:05)
i mean it's a great (79:05 - 79:09)
trick right like you you think you don't (79:07 - 79:12)
want candy here's some kids some (79:09 - 79:13)
cards but then there's like there's (79:12 - 79:14)
going to be a certain percentage of (79:13 - 79:16)
those kids who are like well now i can (79:14 - 79:19)
collect pokemon cards (79:16 - 79:19)
give them the first taste for free (79:20 - 79:26)
and then you've got a customer for life (79:24 - 79:27)
oh you're gonna buy these just open on (79:26 - 79:29)
stream (79:27 - 79:30)
i think a lot of people are just gonna (79:29 - 79:32)
buy them because they're gonna be like (79:30 - 79:34)
what's inside these packs is it a (79:32 - 79:37)
special set or is it just special packs (79:34 - 79:40)
right so it may just be (79:37 - 79:43)
it's just all pumpkaboo pidgeys and (79:40 - 79:45)
pikachu (79:43 - 79:47)
well with the with the dollar store pack (79:45 - 79:49)
okay so for those that maybe don't know (79:47 - 79:51)
how a booster pack works when you buy a (79:49 - 79:54)
booster pack you are guaranteed a rare (79:51 - 79:55)
card (79:54 - 79:57)
now there are different levels of rare (79:55 - 80:00)
there is a non-hollow rare there's a (79:57 - 80:02)
hollow rare there's a reverse hollow (80:00 - 80:04)
rare there's a ultra rare there's a (80:02 - 80:06)
secret rare there's an ultra secret rare (80:04 - 80:07)
there's a full art like there's a bunch (80:06 - 80:09)
of rainbow rare like there's a bunch of (80:07 - 80:13)
rarity but when you buy a 10 card 399 (80:09 - 80:16)
booster pack you are guaranteed one rare (80:13 - 80:19)
most of them are bad uh but when you buy (80:16 - 80:20)
a dollar store pack you're not (80:19 - 80:22)
guaranteed anything (80:20 - 80:24)
but (80:22 - 80:25)
the dollar store packs still have rares (80:24 - 80:28)
they still have secret rares they still (80:25 - 80:30)
have cards but it's (80:28 - 80:31)
not (80:30 - 80:33)
guaranteed just less likely that you (80:31 - 80:34)
have or (80:33 - 80:37)
reduced opportunity to pull (80:34 - 80:38)
a rare (80:37 - 80:41)
so i would assume (80:38 - 80:44)
that the booster packs have (80:41 - 80:47)
break this is going on the website (80:44 - 80:49)
uh (80:47 - 80:49)
but (80:49 - 80:52)
what do you guys do greg you give out (80:50 - 80:54)
candy for halloween (80:52 - 80:56)
there's no kids in our area and i don't (80:54 - 80:58)
want to deal with them (80:56 - 81:00)
so we used to have a lot of kids and we (80:58 - 81:03)
did it for a while and then (81:00 - 81:05)
the neighborhood got really expensive (81:03 - 81:07)
and a lot of the kids (81:05 - 81:08)
left (81:07 - 81:11)
uh so that it was just like (81:08 - 81:12)
okay (81:11 - 81:14)
i don't want a giant bag of candy in my (81:12 - 81:16)
house that i'll just eat (81:14 - 81:17)
yeah (81:16 - 81:19)
uh and there's some coming back but it's (81:17 - 81:21)
like now the moment passed i don't know (81:19 - 81:23)
you keep that light off is that what (81:21 - 81:25)
they do in minneapolis they the light on (81:23 - 81:27)
or off yeah lights are off (81:25 - 81:29)
everything's closed we usually leave (81:27 - 81:32)
also this is your first year here uh (81:29 - 81:34)
halloween in minneapolis is actually on (81:32 - 81:35)
halloween correct it's not that (81:34 - 81:38)
milwaukee malarkey it is actually (81:35 - 81:39)
like (81:38 - 81:42)
sunday from noon to like three because (81:39 - 81:45)
pre-designated time (81:42 - 81:46)
it is halloween (81:45 - 81:49)
and can start (81:46 - 81:52)
pretty much any time after five (81:49 - 81:54)
you're gonna get people wandering around (81:52 - 81:56)
but you guys so keep the light off yeah (81:54 - 81:58)
keep the light off (81:56 - 82:00)
don't put decorations up so kind of the (81:58 - 82:03)
the unspoken rule is the house needs to (82:00 - 82:05)
have decorations so like at least a (82:03 - 82:07)
pumpkin out front (82:05 - 82:09)
and the lights have to be on that's sort (82:07 - 82:11)
of like the signal that you are (82:09 - 82:13)
accepting ready for halloween (82:11 - 82:15)
yeah although (82:13 - 82:17)
there are a lot of people who just sit (82:15 - 82:18)
on the second (82:17 - 82:20)
floor of the houses in my neighborhood (82:18 - 82:22)
and have built halloween shoots to shoot (82:20 - 82:26)
candy down to people to avoid actually (82:22 - 82:27)
interaction (82:26 - 82:28)
there's a lot of candy shoots in my (82:27 - 82:30)
neighborhood right now that sounds cool (82:28 - 82:32)
though (82:30 - 82:35)
i i feel like this this trick or trade (82:32 - 82:37)
boost i feel like this is going to go (82:35 - 82:39)
bad like it's just going to be scalpers (82:37 - 82:41)
buying a bunch maybe they maybe they're (82:39 - 82:43)
not maybe they don't want to scalp this (82:41 - 82:44)
but (82:43 - 82:47)
this is not how much it is really (82:44 - 82:50)
i i would imagine it would be 39.99 we (82:47 - 82:52)
need to know if it's a set of new cards (82:50 - 82:53)
or if it's just reprints (82:52 - 82:55)
that's exactly the case there's no way (82:53 - 82:57)
it's not reprints how many charizards (82:55 - 83:00)
are in this set (82:57 - 83:03)
there's no way it's not reprints (83:00 - 83:04)
i mean they're also gonna be from the (83:03 - 83:06)
blazing saddle set or whichever one you (83:04 - 83:08)
say is always like the worst possible (83:06 - 83:10)

if you're competing you'll need to be (85:22 - 85:27)
there wednesday if you're not competing (85:24 - 85:29)
and the the probably the only thing that (85:27 - 85:30)
is actually important to you if you're (85:29 - 85:33)
not competing is opening ceremony on (85:30 - 85:34)
thursday (85:33 - 85:35)
at 9 00 a.m (85:34 - 85:38)
so i actually think i might miss that (85:35 - 85:40)
because i think my plane gets in at 7 (85:38 - 85:42)
a.m on thursday (85:40 - 85:44)
and i gotta figure out how to get to the (85:42 - 85:46)
hotel (85:44 - 85:47)
well it's gonna take you an hour to get (85:46 - 85:51)
through customs to start with yeah so (85:47 - 85:52)
i'm probably gonna miss it it's probably (85:51 - 85:54)
it's fine (85:52 - 85:56)
it'll be recorded online somewhere it'll (85:54 - 85:57)
be okay (85:56 - 85:59)
i was like maybe i should get there on (85:57 - 86:00)
wednesday and then i went to look to (85:59 - 86:02)
change my flight and it was like a two (86:00 - 86:04)
thousand dollar change oh yeah it's a (86:02 - 86:06)
good life that's fine i'll i'm okay with (86:04 - 86:09)
coming on thursday (86:06 - 86:09)
i'm all right with this (86:09 - 86:12)
um (86:12 - 86:17)
yeah that's all the pokemon news so (86:14 - 86:21)
that brings us to question of the week (86:17 - 86:21)
question of the week (86:22 - 86:32)
doesn't anybody ask us questions anymore (86:25 - 86:33)
i thought you were going to do gravy (86:32 - 86:34)
swayze (86:33 - 86:38)
[Laughter] (86:34 - 86:40)
uh this is from brandon from our slack (86:38 - 86:42)
do you think the press cycle for scarlet (86:40 - 86:43)
and violet will follow sword and shield (86:42 - 86:45)
style of showing off details and pokemon (86:43 - 86:47)
every couple weeks closer (86:45 - 86:49)
to legends where they didn't show a lot (86:47 - 86:52)
before release (86:49 - 86:53)
uh (86:52 - 86:55)
i have a feeling it's be much closer to (86:53 - 86:56)
sword and shield (86:55 - 87:00)
i think i think after pokemon worlds (86:56 - 87:02)
that's when we're gonna start getting (87:00 - 87:06)
the really routine scarlet violet press (87:02 - 87:08)
releases (87:06 - 87:08)
uh (87:09 - 87:12)
i mean i think they didn't show off a (87:10 - 87:14)
lot of legends this (87:12 - 87:16)
i think they did show off all they (87:14 - 87:17)
showed legend they showed what legends (87:16 - 87:19)
was yeah (87:17 - 87:21)
there was really nothing more to show i (87:19 - 87:24)
i i don't think there was a ton (87:21 - 87:24)
of new in legends really like there were (87:25 - 87:30)
some new pokemon but not a ton not (87:28 - 87:32)
definitely a lot like what should come (87:30 - 87:34)
in scarlet and violet so i think if (87:32 - 87:35)
you're sort of looking at (87:34 - 87:38)
what they have to show off there will be (87:35 - 87:40)
more to show for scarlet and violet so (87:38 - 87:43)
feel like sword and shield 100 because (87:40 - 87:44)
legends (87:43 - 87:47)
for as limited the multiplayer (87:44 - 87:49)
experience of pokemon is already legends (87:47 - 87:52)
was less yeah so it's like (87:49 - 87:55)
what are you gonna talk about (87:52 - 87:56)
yeah i mean like (87:55 - 87:59)
a big thing i was worried about with (87:56 - 88:01)
legends is they didn't really show any (87:59 - 88:02)
trainer battles (88:01 - 88:04)
and that game has like seven trainer (88:02 - 88:06)
battles (88:04 - 88:07)
like you fight a togepi like twice and (88:06 - 88:10)
then you fight a pikachu and then (88:07 - 88:14)
if if you complete the credits (88:10 - 88:17)
you can do like one extra battle that is (88:14 - 88:20)
very unfair but like it exists (88:17 - 88:23)
um (88:20 - 88:23)
they i (88:23 - 88:26)
in retros (88:25 - 88:28)
it i can see how it felt like they (88:26 - 88:29)
didn't show a lot for legends but then (88:28 - 88:31)
in retrospect they pretty much showed (88:29 - 88:33)
entirely what that game was from start (88:31 - 88:36)
to finish honestly (88:33 - 88:36)
there was just what like a handful of (88:37 - 88:40)
poke said there was like a handful of (88:38 - 88:41)
pokemon they didn't (88:40 - 88:44)
show but that that's like every pokemon (88:41 - 88:46)
game (88:44 - 88:48)
i mean they didn't show that there was (88:46 - 88:50)
like a bad guy that would take all your (88:48 - 88:51)
money (88:50 - 88:52)
and (88:51 - 88:55)
he existed (88:52 - 88:55)
um (88:57 - 88:59)

oh yeah well with the cheering and (90:25 - 90:30)
everything yeah definitely (90:27 - 90:32)
mm-hmm i try to think of what legend is (90:30 - 90:33)
i usually have the sound off so it's (90:32 - 90:37)
hard for me to like pick them out (90:33 - 90:40)

uh mustard (90:40 - 90:45)

what the heck they're waiting for that (90:59 - 91:02)
third dlc (91:01 - 91:06)
[Laughter] (91:02 - 91:06)
they're waiting to add the remaining 180 (91:07 - 91:12)
pokemon bee drills on the sidelines he's (91:09 - 91:15)
wait he's ready (91:12 - 91:15)
um (91:16 - 91:19)
gosh i'm trying to think of (91:17 - 91:22)
legends (91:19 - 91:22)
like i don't think the xerneas one was (91:24 - 91:27)
very good (91:26 - 91:28)
i don't remember it so it can't be that (91:27 - 91:30)
you no i don't think xerneas and eva (91:28 - 91:33)
talk were good at all (91:30 - 91:33)
i i kind of i mean i like dianthus but i (91:35 - 91:41)
would just like to anthony in general so (91:37 - 91:41)
does leah have a specific theme (91:42 - 91:46)
he does yeah (91:45 - 91:47)
is it (91:46 - 91:48)
i would no because we don't have the (91:47 - 91:51)
soundtrack (91:48 - 91:51)
let me look it up on youtube (91:52 - 91:56)
no (92:01 - 92:04)
i'm out (92:02 - 92:04)
no (92:11 - 92:14)
uh we'll do one more question (92:12 - 92:16)
uh this is from robert if you had to (92:14 - 92:18)
choose one battle gimmick to permanently (92:16 - 92:21)
to be permanent in the main series and (92:18 - 92:23)
one to never come back which would they (92:21 - 92:24)
be (92:23 - 92:26)
uh mega evolution is permanent (92:24 - 92:28)
gigantomax go on (92:26 - 92:31)
[Music] (92:28 - 92:35)
give me more mega pokemon (92:31 - 92:35)
triple battles i want triple battles i (92:41 - 92:46)
want rotation let's bring that rotation (92:44 - 92:48)
battles i want everything opposite of (92:46 - 92:50)
what will say it's (92:48 - 92:52)
any gimmick (92:50 - 92:54)
they said battle gimmick oh battle (92:52 - 92:57)
gimmick ugh (92:54 - 92:57)
no one's out here saying they want gems (92:57 - 93:02)
coming back from gen five oh (92:59 - 93:02)
i mean i like gigantomax way better than (93:02 - 93:07)
i like megas so i would keep giganta max (93:04 - 93:10)
forever (93:07 - 93:10)
so okay so though (93:10 - 93:15)
gen eight is dynamics (93:12 - 93:16)
gen (93:15 - 93:20)
seven is z crystals never gone (93:16 - 93:21)
gone (93:20 - 93:23)
z crystals are by choice should never (93:21 - 93:26)
come back goodbye z crystals gen six is (93:23 - 93:27)
is (93:26 - 93:29)
megas (93:27 - 93:32)
and then gen five was gems (93:29 - 93:36)
nah never james (93:32 - 93:36)
i would say gems were better than z (93:36 - 93:39)
crystals (93:37 - 93:40)
yeah i mean i'm getting rid of z (93:39 - 93:42)
crystals for sure i don't like z (93:40 - 93:47)
crystals um gen 4 didn't have a gimmick (93:42 - 93:49)
gen 3 i guess you could you could argue (93:47 - 93:51)
well maybe it did i can't think gen 3 i (93:49 - 93:52)
guess you could argue the gimmick was (93:51 - 93:53)
like weather but that ended up being (93:52 - 93:56)
permanent yeah well double battles was (93:53 - 93:58)
the gimmick in gen 3. yeah (93:56 - 94:00)
gen 4 was them just like figuring that (93:58 - 94:02)
out like competitive really started in (94:00 - 94:04)
gen 5 right i know there was like some (94:02 - 94:06)
people wrong i talked about competitive (94:04 - 94:07)
gen four i'm sure you did but like (94:06 - 94:09)
actual competitive that has been (94:07 - 94:10)
acknowledged by everyone was like gen (94:09 - 94:12)
five (94:10 - 94:13)
yeah i would definitely get rid of the (94:12 - 94:18)
sea crystals i would keep (94:13 - 94:18)
would keep dynamex (94:18 - 94:23)
make that permanent (94:20 - 94:23)
i would keep dynamaxx (94:24 - 94:28)
i would get rid of (94:28 - 94:34)
c crystals megas are kind of in between (94:31 - 94:35)
yeah i mean (94:34 - 94:39)
they would have to really expand megas (94:35 - 94:41)
across the board for me to be on board (94:39 - 94:43)
with this well yeah i mean like if it (94:41 - 94:45)
becomes permanent give us more mega (94:43 - 94:47)
pokemon yeah yeah the the problem with (94:45 - 94:50)
megas is there's like 64 of them (94:47 - 94:51)
and like only like eight of them are (94:50 - 94:53)

somewhere (95:37 - 95:41)
i hidden back here on the screen this (95:39 - 95:43)
very specific punctuation pokemon while (95:41 - 95:45)
technically available in the wild in (95:43 - 95:47)
pokemon go was only ever available as (95:45 - 95:49)
part of an event one time so is very (95:47 - 95:54)
sought after by pokemon go enthusiasts (95:49 - 95:54)
it's (95:54 - 95:59)
chansey (95:57 - 96:01)
that's not a punctuation (95:59 - 96:04)
it's unknown question mark unknown (96:01 - 96:08)
question i should say unknown (96:04 - 96:12)
that's also a way of saying it yes (96:08 - 96:12)
there's a lot of trivia about yeah (96:19 - 96:23)
unknown's a huge thing what about (96:21 - 96:26)
specifically about unknown question mark (96:23 - 96:30)
that you know i'm unsure of i don't (96:26 - 96:32)
care for the shiny (96:30 - 96:34)
it's okay all the shuffle icons are good (96:32 - 96:35)
but i don't care for the show the (96:34 - 96:38)
chinese sort of man (96:35 - 96:40)
this is blue (96:38 - 96:40)
unknown is currently represented in the (96:43 - 96:48)
trading card game by the most cards of (96:45 - 96:51)
any pokemon after pikachu with 90 unique (96:48 - 96:53)
cards (96:51 - 96:56)
that don't do anything (96:53 - 96:57)
uh there was there's an unknown that (96:56 - 96:59)
like lets you win if you have like 40 (96:57 - 97:03)
cards in your hand or something (96:59 - 97:03)
due to the unknown's letter and (97:07 - 97:11)
shininess both being determined by ivs (97:09 - 97:15)
and gen 2 which are called dvs as well (97:11 - 97:18)
shiny unknown will either always be i or (97:15 - 97:21)
v in those games (97:18 - 97:21)
unknown is the only pokemon in the (97:25 - 97:29)
sinnoh pokedex that is not legendary or (97:26 - 97:31)
mythical not used by any trainer in (97:29 - 97:35)
pokemon diamond and pearl (97:31 - 97:35)
why (97:38 - 97:42)
i think that's like (97:40 - 97:43)
um (97:42 - 97:46)
remember like when you played the gen 5 (97:43 - 97:48)
games if you literally battled every (97:46 - 97:50)
trainer in the game right you would have (97:48 - 97:53)
seen every pokemon right so in sinnoh if (97:50 - 97:55)
you battle every trainer you still will (97:53 - 97:58)
not have seen unknown (97:55 - 97:59)
yeah (97:58 - 98:00)
oh i say i see yeah cause you have to go (97:59 - 98:02)
to the cave (98:00 - 98:04)
yes yeah the ruins of elf (98:02 - 98:07)
in legends arceus unknown are the only (98:04 - 98:08)
pokemon that can be found in the wild (98:07 - 98:12)
with no preferred foods (98:08 - 98:12)
that's a trivia (98:12 - 98:18)
that is that is a trivia (98:15 - 98:19)
which which letter did they use for the (98:18 - 98:21)
shuffle (98:19 - 98:25)
uh there are they're all right (98:21 - 98:25)
on the shuffle on shuffle uh (98:25 - 98:31)
[Music] (98:28 - 98:31)
exclamation (98:32 - 98:36)
and question mark (98:34 - 98:37)
are listed here (98:36 - 98:39)
i think they did all of them in shuffle (98:37 - 98:42)
mm-hmm (98:39 - 98:42)
i don't know if people know this but in (98:46 - 98:50)
legends arceus when you do hidden power (98:47 - 98:53)
it always picks the super effective (98:50 - 98:54)
move (98:53 - 98:57)
which is the change to hidden power (98:54 - 98:59)
so if you're fighting unknown (98:57 - 99:00)
which i don't know why you wouldn't be (98:59 - 99:02)
fighting a known unless you were doing (99:00 - 99:05)
the arceus battle (99:02 - 99:06)
whatever you send out they will they (99:05 - 99:08)
will hidden power super effective (99:06 - 99:09)
against you (99:08 - 99:12)
hmm (99:09 - 99:12)
all right this is this is ultimately why (99:12 - 99:17)
they they did the the dexit right like (99:14 - 99:19)
they can they can choose never to put (99:17 - 99:21)
unknown in like an actual competitive (99:19 - 99:23)
game or they can like get around (99:21 - 99:25)
smeargle they can get around (99:23 - 99:29)
deerling they can get around uh inkay (99:25 - 99:31)
like they have come up with so many (99:29 - 99:33)
gimmicks that they like cannot keep (99:31 - 99:35)
track of they're like just cut don't put (99:33 - 99:35)
them in (99:35 - 99:37)
we forgot to put the upside down (99:35 - 99:41)
gimmick in cut nk (99:37 - 99:43)
all right this week's pokemon i was (99:41 - 99:45)
gonna try to do uh tell me you don't (99:43 - 99:46)
know pokemon without telling me you (99:45 - 99:48)
don't know pokemon but that was (99:46 - 99:52)
i find those offensive (99:48 - 99:52)
this is gonna be worse (99:52 - 99:57)
it's a seven (99:55 - 99:59)
but that's the sum of the uh two other (99:57 - 100:00)
numbers that make up its national dex (99:59 - 100:03)
number which are also primes and its (100:00 - 100:05)
name sounds like the other pokemon of (100:03 - 100:08)
which it was made in interpretation and (100:05 - 100:10)
so far unlike that other pokemon it does (100:08 - 100:13)
not have a third evolution but you also (100:10 - 100:14)
need high friendship to achieve its (100:13 - 100:17)
final evolution (100:14 - 100:17)
i'd say that makes it a five (100:18 - 100:23)
