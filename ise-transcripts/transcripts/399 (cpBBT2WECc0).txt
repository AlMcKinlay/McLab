[Music] (0:01 - 0:29)
what's up everyone welcome to the 390 (0:25 - 0:32)
ninth episode of the Pokemon podcast (0:29 - 0:33)
it's super effective (0:32 - 0:37)
I'm your host s BJ my jaw hurts still (0:33 - 0:40)
but what Greg is here I think I should (0:37 - 0:43)
actually do because I'm a monster and I (0:40 - 0:48)
ate some stale skittles wait and I (0:43 - 0:50)
couldn't stop eating them and then I (0:48 - 0:53)
think I popped my jaw from it now how (0:50 - 0:55)
long did you have these skittles let's (0:53 - 0:59)
not talk about that the skittles are an (0:55 - 1:02)
eternal food ya know they're still good (0:59 - 1:03)
they're just a little they're just a lot (1:02 - 1:04)
harder than they should be (1:03 - 1:13)
yeah you are such a trash Panda I know I (1:04 - 1:15)
was like yeah that was kind of hard and (1:13 - 1:24)
then the bag live around the corner for (1:15 - 1:26)
a convenience store where you can very (1:24 - 1:31)
easily pick up a fresh bag of Skittles (1:26 - 1:31)
expensive you're wagering that that (1:31 - 1:35)
convenience store has fresh skittles (1:33 - 1:40)
oh I mean if it doesn't have skittles (1:35 - 1:41)
it's gonna have some other fruit (1:40 - 1:45)
flavored based candy rinse bronze (1:41 - 1:50)
nobody wants runs runs Craig's here (1:45 - 1:53)
Will's here yeah I had something funny I (1:50 - 1:54)
was gonna say but then I forgot what it (1:53 - 1:58)
was so y'all suffer till next week (1:54 - 2:02)
something about sunshine and Pat oh yes (1:58 - 2:04)
I was going to say life is full of Kenny (2:02 - 2:07)
tiny frustrations but you if you greet (2:04 - 2:09)
them all with a cheerful disposition (2:07 - 2:11)
then they have failed and you can relish (2:09 - 2:13)
in their failure there's your wisdom for (2:11 - 2:17)
the week so like skittles yeah now they (2:13 - 2:20)
stop but if you say yeah I hurt my job (2:17 - 2:26)
with them if you say it with a smile (2:20 - 2:28)
then that whole effort of those bestest (2:26 - 2:29)
skittles to ruin your day has been (2:28 - 2:31)
destroyed and you've ruined their life (2:29 - 2:33)
and made them miserable I mean apart (2:31 - 2:34)
from the fact that you can't smile (2:33 - 2:36)
because you broke your jaw eating busted (2:34 - 2:38)
old skittles look if you're smiling with (2:36 - 2:39)
your jaw you're doing it wrong (2:38 - 2:41)
smiles all about the lips you smile with (2:39 - 2:44)
your whole face or you're not smiling we (2:41 - 2:46)
have to work that's how you get wrinkles (2:44 - 2:49)

deleted the maintenance message (4:17 - 4:21)
good thing I screen change just about (4:20 - 4:25)
the hey get your meteor kinda so this (4:21 - 4:28)
was posted on a March 4th and it says (4:25 - 4:30)
thank you for using Pokemon home this (4:28 - 4:32)
message is to inform you that your (4:30 - 4:33)
system maintenance has been scheduled (4:32 - 4:35)
for the following time period during (4:33 - 4:37)
maintenance all features of Pokemon home (4:35 - 4:39)
will become unavailable and that is (4:37 - 4:45)
between 1:30 to 8:00 UTC on March 6 so (4:39 - 4:47)
this just happened that says the fix (4:45 - 4:50)
would be in all bold in all underline a (4:47 - 4:53)
fix for the issue with the (4:50 - 4:55)
gift presented to players who have (4:53 - 4:57)
completed their national pokedex is (4:55 - 5:01)
before 11:00 a.m. UTC on Friday February (4:57 - 5:04)
14th 2020 there were issues with (5:01 - 5:06)
previous gifts that were distributed and (5:04 - 5:08)
so the correct gift will be sent to (5:06 - 5:10)
eligible players gift boxes after (5:08 - 5:12)
maintenance concludes those who already (5:10 - 5:15)
received an incorrect gift she changes (5:12 - 5:17)
made to their data to fix the situation (5:15 - 5:21)
I have a lot of questions Shirley why (5:17 - 5:24)
don't you hit me with your question okay (5:21 - 5:31)
if we are what was the incorrect give (5:24 - 5:36)
you a Sun curd a correct gift was (5:31 - 5:42)
regular Magana oh the gear 'no of other (5:36 - 5:45)
color you're supposed to get a shiny (5:42 - 5:47)
McGee Rena no you were supposed to get (5:45 - 5:52)
original form like which is not shiny (5:47 - 5:55)
not pokeball macaron huh that is (5:52 - 5:57)
pokeball McKenna original a lot really (5:55 - 6:00)
original form on all over okay yeah (5:57 - 6:03)
original form is the Polka ball one and (6:00 - 6:06)
then McGee runner from Sun and Moon is (6:03 - 6:11)
the silver and pink one and then the (6:06 - 6:14)
McGee erna from the anime that lily has (6:11 - 6:18)
is the shiny silver and pink one and (6:14 - 6:22)
then the black and gold one is the shiny (6:18 - 6:26)
of the original form Agena which is the (6:22 - 6:29)
pokeball one that all made sense right (6:26 - 6:32)
no we're all following if I I made a (6:29 - 6:35)
graphic to clearly lay this out for (6:32 - 6:39)
people because I'm Kira yes I put it on (6:35 - 6:41)
Instagram I put on Twitter because a lot (6:39 - 6:43)
of people thought that the pokeball my (6:41 - 6:45)
gear and it was the shiny my gear down (6:43 - 6:46)
but it's not the shiny my gear now but (6:45 - 6:49)
that so if you complete your polka if (6:46 - 6:52)
you get all 890 Pokemon and I get this (6:49 - 6:56)
all the time I say if you get all 890 (6:52 - 6:58)
pokemon and the first question is from (6:56 - 7:00)
everyone is does that include mythical (6:58 - 7:04)
if you get all 880 Foca mom ever (7:00 - 7:09)
every single one from 0:01 to 890 (7:04 - 7:14)
witches California nope it's a turn at (7:09 - 7:17)
this and if you have them all in Pokemon (7:14 - 7:21)
home you are supposed to get a original (7:17 - 7:25)
form pokeball looking Miggy Erna but (7:21 - 7:28)
it's been broken some people got regular (7:25 - 7:31)
Miggy Erna and some people got eight (7:28 - 7:33)
regular Miggy or nut and some people got (7:31 - 7:34)
like four regular Miggy Erna and some (7:33 - 7:37)
people got McGee Erna regular mugear not (7:34 - 7:42)
with a the happy birthday ribbon on it I (7:37 - 7:44)
didn't believe that until they provided (7:42 - 7:48)
me a screen shot I don't I don't know (7:44 - 7:51)
why because it was obviously broken some (7:48 - 7:54)
people have gotten the original form (7:51 - 7:56)
Miggy Erna by shifting their boxes left (7:54 - 7:58)
and right to trigger it (7:56 - 8:02)
but in the in this maintenance update (7:58 - 8:04)
that they since removed because I guess (8:02 - 8:07)
maintenance was complete it does say (8:04 - 8:10)
there is an issue where the system (8:07 - 8:12)
failed to correctly reckon recognize (8:10 - 8:15)
whether a pokedex was and then it gets (8:12 - 8:16)
cut off because I didn't take a (8:15 - 8:17)
screenshot of the rest of that but (8:16 - 8:18)
ultimately I'll sum it up because I'm (8:17 - 8:21)
reading it pretty much in this (8:18 - 8:23)
maintenance update it says that they are (8:21 - 8:25)
aware that there's an issue where (8:23 - 8:27)
Pokemon home is not recognizing a (8:25 - 8:29)
complete pokedex so therefore it doesn't (8:27 - 8:31)
give you original form McNerney even if (8:29 - 8:33)
you have a complete pokedex and so in (8:31 - 8:36)
this up maintenance update on March 4th (8:33 - 8:39)
the bottom of it says we've acknowledged (8:36 - 8:42)
that the Pokedex is not registering all (8:39 - 8:44)
the pokemon and we will fix this in a (8:42 - 8:45)
future update so this is the first time (8:44 - 8:48)
they've acknowledged that some people (8:45 - 8:51)
are not getting their Magana because the (8:48 - 8:53)
Pokedex isn't registering but as of (8:51 - 8:56)
right now pokemon home is updated to one (8:53 - 8:59)
point zero point ten which should be (8:56 - 9:02)
your latest version and that server (8:59 - 9:05)
update has been implemented I don't (9:02 - 9:08)
think so I guess we'll have to find out (9:05 - 9:10)
if you're in slack or discord or on (9:08 - 9:12)
Twitter if you want to let us know if (9:10 - 9:14)
you didn't get original mcgahren to the (9:12 - 9:16)
first time and you got regular Magana (9:14 - 9:18)
did they take your original McGee (9:16 - 9:20)
away they give you a new one did you (9:18 - 9:24)
still not get it I actually don't have a (9:20 - 9:25)
large enough pool to figure that out (9:24 - 9:27)
I've been told by one person that they (9:25 - 9:32)
got eight original Magee Rinna or eight (9:27 - 9:36)
normal Magee Rinna the silver ones and (9:32 - 9:39)
they didn't take him away eight yeah I (9:36 - 9:42)
don't know because he's broken I look I (9:39 - 9:46)
don't I haven't know McGee Rinna because (9:42 - 9:49)
I haven't tried to get the pokeball (9:46 - 9:52)
McGee on it yet I mean I it's still (9:49 - 9:54)
there saying that I've only completed (9:52 - 9:57)
three days home so I'm waiting for that (9:54 - 10:01)
fixed weird because mine like four days (9:57 - 10:03)
in said I had completed ten days of home (10:01 - 10:07)
so yeah obviously not trying hard enough (10:03 - 10:11)
maybe I'm in it all the time yeah it's (10:07 - 10:12)
interesting how the server sees (10:11 - 10:15)
different phones at different days (10:12 - 10:17)
because I've been at five days of using (10:15 - 10:20)
Pokemon home since like day two yeah I (10:17 - 10:23)
mean I said I even sent them uh I sent (10:20 - 10:27)
in a bug report saying hey that's broken (10:23 - 10:32)
and they not gotten back to me (10:27 - 10:34)
I am curious if by the pot time this (10:32 - 10:36)
podcast goes up I'm pretty sure every (10:34 - 10:38)
Monday evening an update for Pokemon (10:36 - 10:40)
Home has come out I'd have to look at (10:38 - 10:43)
the calendar but I'm pretty sure ten (10:40 - 10:46)
point the one point zero point ten came (10:43 - 10:49)
out just hours after will not hours but (10:46 - 10:51)
like twelve hours after our podcast came (10:49 - 10:52)
out and it seems that every Monday (10:51 - 10:54)
evening an update is available so I (10:52 - 10:57)
don't know maybe I mean again we've (10:54 - 11:00)
talked about this before Pokemon bank (10:57 - 11:03)
was out for seven plus years in that (11:00 - 11:06)
lifetime only got four updates you know (11:03 - 11:09)
put waited for Pokemon they've had no (11:06 - 11:13)
wild promises with Bank exactly Pokemon (11:09 - 11:15)
Home has been out for about a month now (11:13 - 11:18)
and I'm just cost a thousand more (11:15 - 11:19)
headaches (11:18 - 11:23)
[Laughter] (11:19 - 11:26)
it's had about ten updates I actually (11:23 - 11:28)
like the way they do the Wonder trade I (11:26 - 11:31)
like how it's pretty much it seems like (11:28 - 11:34)
it's twice a day you put pokemon in in (11:31 - 11:36)
the morning you get new pokemon in the (11:34 - 11:38)
afternoon you put pokemon in in the in (11:36 - 11:40)
the evening you wake up to pokemon in (11:38 - 11:43)
the morning it seems that's that's the (11:40 - 11:45)
system it's doing I mean it's probably (11:43 - 11:48)
possible to get Pokemon the Wonder trade (11:45 - 11:50)
to probably trigger three times a day (11:48 - 11:53)
but they seem to be activating it on (11:50 - 11:56)
some sort of schedule yeah I haven't (11:53 - 11:58)
done it in a bit I almost feel like (11:56 - 12:02)
Pokemon is against people having like (11:58 - 12:03)
non-randomized (12:02 - 12:06)
trades anymore because in the past week (12:03 - 12:08)
I had to trade some Pokemon with a (12:06 - 12:10)
friend of mine and the conversation went (12:08 - 12:13)
like this can we trade our Pokemon and (12:10 - 12:15)
poke him on home he said no Pokemon home (12:13 - 12:17)
doesn't support remote trades and they (12:15 - 12:19)
said well what about the room trey is (12:17 - 12:21)
like no that's not for two people it (12:19 - 12:23)
doesn't work we have to do it in sword (12:21 - 12:24)
and shield and then we went in a sword (12:23 - 12:26)
and shield and it literally took us an (12:24 - 12:29)
hour to get the codes to match up ah (12:26 - 12:32)
I literally were you connected to the (12:29 - 12:33)
Internet or did where you connected (12:32 - 12:37)
luckily I'm connected locally and like I (12:33 - 12:41)
can't find oh no no no and and it's like (12:37 - 12:44)
I matched with codes with other people (12:41 - 12:45)
before I matched with (12:44 - 12:48)
friend and they're like this you got to (12:45 - 12:51)
stop using one one one two I use five (12:48 - 12:56)
eight eight nine so come on whoo stop (12:51 - 12:58)
everybody else stop using five eight (12:56 - 13:01)
eight nine is mine I have my own secret (12:58 - 13:04)
code that a that has worked every time (13:01 - 13:05)
yeah my code has worked every time - (13:04 - 13:08)
what's your code I'm not telling you (13:05 - 13:11)
I'll tell you my secret code the ISE (13:08 - 13:15)
secret code here it is zero one one one (13:11 - 13:20)
it's just Irene's birthday uh-huh (13:15 - 13:23)
but no one starts off with a zero (13:20 - 13:25)
because the zeros at the bottom people (13:23 - 13:27)
only start off with a one cuz they're (13:25 - 13:30)
lazy life hack there you go (13:27 - 13:32)
zero one one right also Goulding's (13:30 - 13:40)
pokedex yeah you know I was in I was in (13:32 - 13:44)

but I met multiple people and thank you (13:55 - 14:00)
for saying hi to me at PAX I really (13:58 - 14:02)
appreciate it you were packed for a half (14:00 - 14:05)
a second I was I was but the entire time (14:02 - 14:07)
I walked away from the person and I got (14:05 - 14:09)
back to my friend's house I was staying (14:07 - 14:10)
with Nick who does the music for the (14:09 - 14:14)
show I was like oh dang I could have (14:10 - 14:15)
used Pokemon home and I could have (14:14 - 14:17)
traded people I could have done I've (14:15 - 14:20)
never done the GPS betrayed Pokemon you (14:17 - 14:22)
can't trade people that's illegal (14:20 - 14:25)
I didn't have a pole staying next to the (14:22 - 14:27)
person in trade with them thing and I (14:25 - 14:32)
forgot I've done it is it cool is (14:27 - 14:34)
exactly the same like every other trade (14:32 - 14:38)
secrets alright if you've done it in (14:34 - 14:41)
Pokemon go you've done it no is that (14:38 - 14:43)
like there's like a special screen that (14:41 - 14:45)
says hey you're finally near somebody (14:43 - 14:47)
congratulations it's let's trade these (14:45 - 14:49)
balls heck yeah (14:47 - 14:52)
so I'm about let's do a Pokemon home (14:49 - 14:55)
update I'm about sixty Pokemon away from (14:52 - 14:59)
890 I'm missing (14:55 - 15:01)
I actually have them all but I the (14:59 - 15:03)
Pokemon that I'm that I need the 60 that (15:01 - 15:06)
I'm missing or all that I do have I have (15:03 - 15:08)
them in black - white - but I can't move (15:06 - 15:11)
them from black to white - because I'm (15:08 - 15:13)
trying to get a complete pokedex in that (15:11 - 15:16)
game because I want the shiny charm (15:13 - 15:17)
which was introduced in black and white (15:16 - 15:21)
- in that game first so I can't commit (15:17 - 15:23)
to moving this Pokemon so I have to (15:21 - 15:25)
recap those sixties so I'm missing (15:23 - 15:27)
missing a lot of middle evolution (15:25 - 15:30)
starters which you know I have M bores I (15:27 - 15:34)
have samurais I have Typhlosion 's but I (15:30 - 15:36)
can't breed them in sword and shield so (15:34 - 15:39)
I have to figure out how to do that in (15:36 - 15:41)
Sun and Moon and then move them up which (15:39 - 15:43)
is fine a little bit of a hassle but (15:41 - 15:46)
fine I'm missing you know the classic (15:43 - 15:49)
pokémon like delcatty and or sorry not (15:46 - 15:52)
lkd glammy ow and and / ugly because (15:49 - 15:53)
they've only been available in like two (15:52 - 15:57)
games ever in the Pokemon industry and (15:53 - 16:00)
then I'm missing Landorus and kiram are (15:57 - 16:02)
probably the two Legendary's I'm missing (16:00 - 16:04)
which I can get both those in sword I (16:02 - 16:06)
can but get both those in a game called (16:04 - 16:09)
ultra Sun altar moon if I didn't move my (16:06 - 16:12)
zekrom and rush room or my thunderous (16:09 - 16:16)
and tornados up into sword and shield so (16:12 - 16:18)
now I have fooled ya I messed up so now (16:16 - 16:21)
I have to use a different copy of Sun (16:18 - 16:25)
and Moon to get the Landorus or sorry to (16:21 - 16:28)
get a thunderous and dazed tornadoes to (16:25 - 16:30)
then move to my other copy - then find a (16:28 - 16:33)
wormhole that has a Landorus so (16:30 - 16:35)

Jolteon is the one I'm missing Jolteon (17:15 - 17:19)
watch strikes again (17:17 - 17:22)
yeah the thunderstorm over there and (17:19 - 17:26)
that diamond often yeah and I have to (17:22 - 17:30)
evolve mana but I don't have a moonstone (17:26 - 17:33)
and it's hard to get those I have about (17:30 - 17:36)
500 you want one I'm stone I can trade (17:33 - 17:39)

lunatone mmm and the digging guys and (18:05 - 18:11)
the digger dudes which I don't patronize (18:08 - 18:14)
their business I find them Baiju sketchy (18:11 - 18:17)
I use them whenever I remember to use (18:14 - 18:20)
them which isn't a lot but happens I had (18:17 - 18:22)
somebody ask me the other day if they (18:20 - 18:26)
thought using a turbo controller to talk (18:22 - 18:29)
to the digging duo over and over was (18:26 - 18:31)
considered cheating or if using a turbo (18:29 - 18:34)
controller to talk to careless over and (18:31 - 18:37)
over was considered cheating and I said (18:34 - 18:39)
if anything it's actually considered (18:37 - 18:43)
probably smart financially because your (18:39 - 18:46)
pro controller which is like a $70 (18:43 - 18:49)
controller is only prorated for so many (18:46 - 18:53)
button presses true hmm you don't want (18:49 - 18:55)
to wear out your a button just because (18:53 - 19:00)
you're trying to get moonstones wait (18:55 - 19:03)
wait there's you just the way you just (19:00 - 19:04)
said that there's not a character in the (19:03 - 19:07)
game called careless yeah (19:04 - 19:10)
what yeah para careless careless is her (19:07 - 19:14)
nose the the fossils she's the one (19:10 - 19:16)
that's crying I just give me any two (19:14 - 19:17)
fossils I'll figure it out (19:16 - 19:20)
I never paid attention to her name it's (19:17 - 19:24)
actually pretty clever yeah it is here (19:20 - 19:28)
turns out I didn't do the volcanion (19:24 - 19:31)

rarest most hard to have Pokemon right (19:59 - 20:04)
narrow or arshad or is there aura really (20:01 - 20:06)
yeah there was only one event in the (20:04 - 20:07)
United States for it I only have one (20:06 - 20:12)
volcanion it is from the Helen volcanion (20:07 - 20:17)

using the keyboard on my phone (20:17 - 20:21)
oh I lied that there was only one (20:19 - 20:23)
volcanion distributions only once it's (20:21 - 20:27)

only had one Zehra aura I may have found (21:02 - 21:10)
a second one hidden amongst my hidden (21:06 - 21:13)
amongst my many 3ds just lying here on (21:10 - 21:16)
maybe you can how did I only get one of (21:13 - 21:18)
these you know many copies of X&Y and (21:16 - 21:19)
I'm so mad at my (21:18 - 21:23)
I'm so confused too cuz I just have to (21:19 - 21:25)
wait two pulls of this had even when (21:23 - 21:28)
Game Stop was being real jerky about (21:25 - 21:30)
giving her out about multiple codes yeah (21:28 - 21:32)
it could have been a dumb thing to wear (21:30 - 21:35)
I got like 18 codes from them but I only (21:32 - 21:36)
redeemed a one and then I forgot to (21:35 - 21:39)
redeem the other that sound that right (21:36 - 21:42)
that's probably true I also lost my (21:39 - 21:44)
other 3ds I'm pretty sure I brought it (21:42 - 21:47)
with me when I moved so if anybody knows (21:44 - 21:50)
where it is I think I lost my copy of (21:47 - 21:54)
black hmm I could lost my copy of white (21:50 - 21:55)
- at Steve's house cuz he keeps (21:54 - 21:57)
conveniently forgetting to give it to me (21:55 - 22:00)

point when I I don't know have nothing (28:45 - 28:50)
to do with my life which is never I will (28:47 - 28:52)
have to go through and start trying to (28:50 - 28:53)
pull all these things onto cartridges (28:52 - 28:55)
that I can move to move them up but yeah (28:53 - 28:58)

so specifically I'm poking my box you (29:02 - 29:06)
can get a swablu which doesn't seem too (29:03 - 29:08)
special except I think it learns fall (29:06 - 29:10)
swipe which i think is exclusive to (29:08 - 29:14)
swablu you can get a Zigzagoon by having (29:10 - 29:15)
a hundred Pokemon in the Pokemon box (29:14 - 29:18)

community every day so without further (31:56 - 32:01)
ado here's Maddie on the Skype move (31:59 - 32:04)
making calls from her office upstairs (32:01 - 32:05)
okay let's go (32:04 - 32:07)
[Music] (32:05 - 32:11)
okay so who am I talking to right now my (32:07 - 32:14)
name is Cody my favorite thing about (32:11 - 32:18)
Pokemon is collecting everything so I am (32:14 - 32:22)
a wildlife biologist and I really like (32:18 - 32:24)
categorizing and knowing all the (32:22 - 32:27)
different animals and I read them cool I (32:24 - 32:29)
like that cuz you're like a real-life (32:27 - 32:32)
pokemon trainer and catcher that's what (32:29 - 32:35)
I like about you so if you had to pick (32:32 - 32:38)
Cody which Pokemon best identifies you (32:35 - 32:41)
and why so I was think about this (32:38 - 32:44)
earlier and I - my favorite Pokemon is (32:41 - 32:46)
shiny a little and Vulpix that's what I (32:44 - 32:48)
have as my buddy in Pokemon Co but I (32:46 - 32:50)
think the Pokemon that I most identify (32:48 - 32:56)
with is probably tangela what do you (32:50 - 32:58)
like about being a girl Pokemon player (32:56 - 33:00)
what does that mean to you you know go (32:58 - 33:03)
ahead my player it to me I think my (33:00 - 33:04)
favorite thing about it has been that (33:03 - 33:22)
I've always underestimate my talking to (33:04 - 33:23)
right now introduce yourself (33:22 - 33:26)
I'm Carolyn also known as best bot (33:23 - 33:29)
creature can you tell me Carolyn what (33:26 - 33:31)
you love about being a girl pokemon (33:29 - 33:35)
player well I've come on forever since I (33:31 - 33:38)
was a small kid so I I grew up with it (33:35 - 33:40)
have a bunch of friends from Pokemon I (33:38 - 33:43)
have way too much Pokemon stuff in my (33:40 - 33:46)
place there's never too much sometimes (33:43 - 33:47)
when you look at how much money you (33:46 - 33:50)
spend the month better that you can (33:47 - 33:52)
just think about later or Never (33:50 - 33:54)
okay so I feel like this might be the (33:52 - 33:56)
easiest question everyone else I'm (33:54 - 33:58)
excited to hear what they say about what (33:56 - 34:01)
Pokemon identifies them the most who do (33:58 - 34:04)
you think Carolyn well it's not my (34:01 - 34:06)
favorite Pokemon but the pokemons that I (34:04 - 34:10)
relate to is Pancham oh I'm surprised (34:06 - 34:15)
because Pancham is feisty and wants to (34:10 - 34:16)
think that it's intimidating but (34:15 - 34:19)
actually it's just (34:16 - 34:22)
oh my gosh I love that it's really cute (34:19 - 34:24)
too so it's not like I don't love him if (34:22 - 34:27)
you had to give advice to any little (34:24 - 34:29)
girls playing Pokemon right now what (34:27 - 34:30)
types of words of wisdom would you give (34:29 - 34:36)
them I would say there's no like on your (34:30 - 34:38)
team just take whoever you like if you (34:36 - 34:40)
want to t-mobile cute pokémon you should (34:38 - 34:46)
do it oh my name is Rochelle (34:40 - 34:48)
I've known you for at least was it I (34:46 - 34:49)
think I've been in here for like over (34:48 - 34:52)
two years now the first thing I knew (34:49 - 34:53)
about you is you're a champion for (34:52 - 34:56)
basically everybody but especially the (34:53 - 34:58)
polkas sister's Channel you're an (34:56 - 34:59)
inspiration on slack when it comes to (34:58 - 35:02)
female empowerment and sisterhood can (34:59 - 35:05)
you tell me why being a female pokemon (35:02 - 35:08)
fan is so important to you feels like a (35:05 - 35:10)
question I would be asked by my (35:08 - 35:15)
therapist nah I don't know I think I (35:10 - 35:16)
don't know this is exactly what you're (35:15 - 35:18)
asking but I think the angle I would (35:16 - 35:21)
probably take this at is that Lake I (35:18 - 35:25)
feel like it's sort of like core essence (35:21 - 35:28)
Pokemon at least should be a space where (35:25 - 35:31)
like anyone everyone is kind of welcome (35:28 - 35:33)
like I think I've talked about this (35:31 - 35:35)
before I were like ever since the very (35:33 - 35:36)
beginning there's been a lot of like (35:35 - 35:39)
gender parity and like the jobs of the (35:36 - 35:41)
Pokemon world and that's always been (35:39 - 35:45)
super inspiring to me like to be able to (35:41 - 35:48)
have women from the very beginning who I (35:45 - 35:52)
like nurses and police officers and the (35:48 - 35:54)
strongest trainers in the whole region (35:52 - 35:56)
like felt like it should be a very (35:54 - 35:58)
welcoming space to be for women (35:56 - 36:00)
especially I totally agree playing that (35:58 - 36:03)
when I was younger like there was never (36:00 - 36:04)
a thing of like oh you're just a girl (36:03 - 36:06)
like you're not you know part of this (36:04 - 36:09)
that had no factor in it I think you (36:06 - 36:12)
really represent that type of attitude (36:09 - 36:15)
and that's hot in how you act in the (36:12 - 36:16)
Pokemon community and it's really (36:15 - 36:22)
inspiring you're inspiring that you say (36:16 - 36:25)
thank you thank you you're welcome (36:22 - 36:27)
what Pokemon it (36:25 - 36:29)
resonates with you who do you identify (36:27 - 36:31)
with the most I could probably come up (36:29 - 36:34)
with a lot of answers for this if you (36:31 - 36:37)
let me figure it out every which way my (36:34 - 36:39)
gut instinct today would actually (36:37 - 36:43)
probably be to say glice APOD i don't (36:39 - 36:44)
know if you're expecting that no I was (36:43 - 36:46)
not (36:44 - 36:49)
because Goliath odd is like when you (36:46 - 36:50)
fight your fight and you fight real hard (36:49 - 36:53)
but also sometimes you get tired and you (36:50 - 36:55)
gotta tap out and identify with that a (36:53 - 36:57)
lot mm-hmm (36:55 - 37:02)
same 100% and also relies upon mostly (36:57 - 37:04)
just wants to like live in a cave and (37:02 - 37:07)
meditate and be chill I'm glad one more (37:04 - 37:09)
question this is also another on that's (37:07 - 37:11)
right up your alley you get to talk to (37:09 - 37:13)
yourself in the past (37:11 - 37:15)
Rochelle picks up her first Pokemon game (37:13 - 37:16)
ever what words it was some are you (37:15 - 37:20)
giving her oh my gosh I (37:16 - 37:23)
I was not expecting to go to Pokemon (37:20 - 37:26)
therapy for this little Q&A session it's (37:23 - 37:28)
me you know me I love this kind of stuff (37:26 - 37:30)
I should have expected this (37:28 - 37:35)
I'm gonna say I would tell myself not to (37:30 - 37:39)
ever worry about anybody who says your (37:35 - 37:41)
favorite Pokemon are silly or dumb (37:39 - 37:43)
because everybody's gonna have their (37:41 - 37:44)
favorites and everyone's gonna think (37:43 - 37:47)
some other ones are stupid and that (37:44 - 37:48)
doesn't mean that they're right it just (37:47 - 37:49)
means that they like different things (37:48 - 37:51)
than you because I spent a lot of time (37:49 - 37:53)
in my childhood being really upset and (37:51 - 37:55)
feeling really bad because no one likes (37:53 - 37:57)
the Pokemon i light and that made me (37:55 - 37:59)
feel like they didn't like me and that's (37:57 - 38:00)
not true (37:59 - 38:02)
rachelle thank you so much for talking (38:00 - 38:09)
with me tonight this is the best a (38:02 - 38:13)
dangerous 7-eleven alone so is this your (38:09 - 38:15)
second International Women's Day episode (38:13 - 38:19)
the day boy if you had to pick one (38:15 - 38:22)
Pokemon to best identify you who would (38:19 - 38:28)
you pick this is a bag of because (38:22 - 38:32)
bagging is learn how to spy and senses (38:28 - 38:33)

advice to any little girls that were (38:44 - 38:47)

pokum I do you feel you really identify (39:05 - 39:11)
with that would have to be the 11th okay (39:07 - 39:15)
I'm always cold and I always need (39:11 - 39:17)
someone to warm me up (39:15 - 39:19)
not just that I kind of am very shy (39:17 - 39:22)
which if you've seen the anime (39:19 - 39:25)
depictions of the available pick she's (39:22 - 39:29)
very shy standoffish she doesn't she's (39:25 - 39:31)
not really friendly but she warms up (39:29 - 39:33)
through that one special person like her (39:31 - 39:36)
trainer Lily and that's kind of me I (39:33 - 39:38)
just take some time to come out of my (39:36 - 39:41)
shell if somebody treats me with (39:38 - 39:43)
kindness and respect and generally shows (39:41 - 39:45)
an interest in me then I'll go up for (39:43 - 39:53)
them slowly surely and you know hi I'm (39:45 - 39:56)
Kelly Kelly who are you (39:53 - 39:56)

that mean to you as a Pokemon fan I know (40:01 - 40:10)
how much we all just genuinely adore (40:05 - 40:10)
there is no judgement which Pokemon do (40:10 - 40:21)
you feel best represents you who do you (40:18 - 40:25)
identify with as a Pokemon because (40:21 - 40:28)
mystery dungeon has to be addressed (40:25 - 40:35)
these are just bad okay Kelly so my (40:28 - 40:37)
little goofball what advice would you (40:35 - 40:38)
give to all the little girls out there (40:37 - 40:40)
that are playing video games no matter (40:38 - 40:44)
how how much you think you can't beat a (40:40 - 40:47)
level or you can't get there I promise (40:44 - 40:50)
you you can you're right you're a (40:47 - 40:52)
hundred percent right (40:50 - 40:55)
uh Haley so it's International Women's (40:52 - 40:58)
Day most definitely the best day of the (40:55 - 41:03)
year what does being a female Pokemon (40:58 - 41:04)
player mean to you what does it mean to (41:03 - 41:06)
be growing up as a girl playing this (41:04 - 41:11)
game I was he's adorable characters but (41:06 - 41:14)
he was able to love and I could connect (41:11 - 41:16)
with a lot of different people over it (41:14 - 41:19)
and there wasn't that I never personally (41:16 - 41:21)
experienced the idea of like oh well (41:19 - 41:23)
Pokemon is for girls so I'm not gonna (41:21 - 41:25)
play it it was like every time I said I (41:23 - 41:27)
was a Pokemon player the reaction I got (41:25 - 41:30)
from males females and everything in (41:27 - 41:31)
between was oh my god who's your (41:30 - 41:34)
favorite rather than any kind of like oh (41:31 - 41:37)
well obviously you must like that (41:34 - 41:38)
because you're a girl gamer who only (41:37 - 41:41)
plays oh ha and my experience to like (41:38 - 41:44)
the Pokemon communities are just so (41:41 - 41:47)
incredibly positive all the time right (41:44 - 41:49)
that like it's it's kind of a safe space (41:47 - 41:51)
to be honest about what you like and (41:49 - 41:54)
what's fun for you if you could pick any (41:51 - 41:56)
Pokemon that best represents you like (41:54 - 41:58)
who do you identify with the most as a (41:56 - 42:01)
Pokemon I think right now in my life I (41:58 - 42:04)
identify most with Eevee (42:01 - 42:08)
because I have a whole and complete (42:04 - 42:10)
person in my own right but I have so (42:08 - 42:13)
many options of things I can become and (42:10 - 42:16)
things that I'm able to do so (42:13 - 42:20)
it's I'm an Eevee that hasn't agreed to (42:16 - 42:24)
evolution that like oh shoot I forget I (42:20 - 42:27)
forget what's called but in the first (42:24 - 42:29)
season that the anime when it's the (42:27 - 42:30)
brothers trying to convince their (42:29 - 42:33)
brother who have Eevee to to pick which (42:30 - 42:36)
stone he wants to introduce to is Evy (42:33 - 42:37)
and he's like no I like my easy as it is (42:36 - 42:41)
look that's me right now (42:37 - 42:41)
can you introduce yourself please (42:41 - 42:48)
Jordi what does be in a part of the (42:45 - 42:51)
Pokemon community mean to you especially (42:48 - 42:53)
in terms of International Women's Day (42:51 - 42:56)
[Applause] (42:53 - 42:56)
interests there are making new friends (42:56 - 43:01)
and honestly connecting with people that (43:00 - 43:12)
you never thought you in women if you (43:01 - 43:14)
had to pick a Pokemon that best (43:12 - 43:15)
represents you (43:14 - 43:19)
who is it Jordan I like to say mimic you (43:15 - 43:22)
know maybe few tries are to change it is (43:19 - 43:25)
you know that like they make stuff up (43:22 - 43:28)
every day and even when it's disguise (43:25 - 43:33)
gets frosted all night it's knit south (43:28 - 43:36)
and it's back that finesse but I think (43:33 - 43:38)
that's very inspirational is there (43:36 - 43:39)
anything else you want to share any (43:38 - 43:42)
advice to poke them like little kids (43:39 - 43:44)
playing Pokemon right now or anybody (43:42 - 43:50)
yeah just pass play make friends how you (43:44 - 43:52)
make friends if I don't play away and (43:50 - 43:55)
just have fun be yourself (43:52 - 43:55)
Kaitlyn what about being a girl Pokemon (44:02 - 44:07)
player is so important to you (44:05 - 44:08)
what does that mean to you basically (44:07 - 44:11)
just growing up there weren't many (44:08 - 44:14)
people in my school that were girls that (44:11 - 44:16)
were playing for fun so it was just fun (44:14 - 44:19)
of me and always kind of been more of a (44:16 - 44:20)
guy thing until I've become an adult (44:19 - 44:22)
especially gotten into this black (44:20 - 44:25)
community and met all the lovely porky (44:22 - 44:29)
sisters and now I am also getting my 10 (44:25 - 44:31)
year old sister and Pokemon as well and (44:29 - 44:33)
it's just super fun to raise another (44:31 - 44:36)
generation of okie sisters isn't that (44:33 - 44:39)
exciting my my baby sister played (44:36 - 44:41)
Pokemon - and now she's pregnant and (44:39 - 44:43)
she's having a little girl and I'm just (44:41 - 44:46)
so excited to be like okay let's get her (44:43 - 44:47)
into this (44:46 - 44:50)
oh yeah that's definitely my first focus (44:47 - 44:52)
when I have kids of my own is by just (44:50 - 44:53)
forcing them into this (44:52 - 44:55)
katelyn if you had to pick a Pokemon (44:53 - 44:58)
that best represents you who do you (44:55 - 45:01)
identify with so I gave this a lot of (44:58 - 45:03)
thought and I think it's gonna have to (45:01 - 45:08)
be slowpoke because it's always the (45:03 - 45:10)
vacant look on its face it takes a (45:08 - 45:12)
really long time to process anything (45:10 - 45:15)
that's happening and literally forgets (45:12 - 45:17)
what it's doing half the time and that's (45:15 - 45:18)
just matter (45:17 - 45:22)
yeah but slowpoke is also so lovable and (45:18 - 45:26)
cute and perfect too right (45:22 - 45:30)
my name is Lydia flowers and I am Adama (45:26 - 45:33)
flowers little sister can you tell me (45:30 - 45:36)
what being like a girl Pokemon fan means (45:33 - 45:37)
to you (45:36 - 45:41)
well I could come into it you know and (45:37 - 45:44)
even though I was probably I don't know (45:41 - 45:46)
five years old when I first started (45:44 - 45:49)
getting into Pokemon you know I could (45:46 - 45:52)
still be you know as strong as top you (45:49 - 45:56)
know as I wanted to be started off like (45:52 - 45:58)
with the playing cards and then moved on (45:56 - 46:02)
to the console games so even those tiny (45:58 - 46:05)
tiny little five six seven year old girl (46:02 - 46:07)
you know getting to have these huge (46:05 - 46:10)
monster pokemons you can make as strong (46:07 - 46:11)
as you want (46:10 - 46:14)
definitely very empowering and just some (46:11 - 46:16)
of my favorite memories are like up at (46:14 - 46:18)
the cabin me and you like laying in bed (46:16 - 46:20)
playing like pokemon diamond or pearl (46:18 - 46:22)
and like we named all of her pokémon (46:20 - 46:26)
after like vh1 reality TV show (46:22 - 46:29)
characters yeah I mean so much of it I (46:26 - 46:31)
mean obviously started apples like the (46:29 - 46:32)
card game but they're moving at a (46:31 - 46:35)
console adjust she'll like community (46:32 - 46:37)
based you click it to play with your (46:35 - 46:40)
sisters or you know as I got older to (46:37 - 46:42)
play with my friends from school (46:40 - 46:44)
boyfriends and all that stuff just fun (46:42 - 46:47)
fun way to connect with everybody do you (46:44 - 46:49)
hope baby Charlotte will play pokemon oh (46:47 - 46:53)

hopefully I'll be talking should we buy (46:53 - 46:57)
a hair pokemon cards did I grow up with (46:54 - 47:00)
obviously it's something that's sticking (46:57 - 47:02)
around and see future generations (47:00 - 47:04)
getting into it just as much as this as (47:02 - 47:07)
much as needed (47:04 - 47:07)
okay so while you may need no (47:07 - 47:12)

how else to hi (47:21 - 47:26)
okay Irene it's International Women's (47:24 - 47:29)
Day maybe the best holiday can you tell (47:26 - 47:32)
me a little bit why being a girl (47:29 - 47:36)
Pokemon fan is so important to you so (47:32 - 47:37)
I've been thinking about this for the (47:36 - 47:44)
last few days I guess and I find that (47:37 - 47:50)
being a woman Pokemon fan is important (47:44 - 47:53)
one just because with gaming and women (47:50 - 47:57)
and stuff like that there's the whole (47:53 - 48:01)
discourse and drama and complexity of (47:57 - 48:05)
being a female gamer by default I think (48:01 - 48:06)
about that generally so it's kind of (48:05 - 48:12)
just like being a fan and trying not to (48:06 - 48:17)
make myself any certain way just trying (48:12 - 48:19)
to fit a mold I guess as a particular (48:17 - 48:21)
fan because I don't really enjoy that (48:19 - 48:24)
it's kind of making sure that I am doing (48:21 - 48:28)
what I enjoy rather than oh I am this (48:24 - 48:31)
I'm a woman and I am a fan and so I need (48:28 - 48:33)
to act this particular way does that (48:31 - 48:34)
make sense (48:33 - 48:36)
that makes so much sense and it's kind (48:34 - 48:38)
of in line with it's really neat to hear (48:36 - 48:39)
everyone's kind of said the same thing (48:38 - 48:42)
or just like if you like what you like (48:39 - 48:44)
then screw it when you're you know (48:42 - 48:47)
there's no certain way to be the fan and (48:44 - 48:49)
like with Pokemon there's so many (48:47 - 48:52)
different parts of the game that if you (48:49 - 48:53)
like collecting you can be a collector (48:52 - 48:55)
if you like the cute ones you can like (48:53 - 48:56)
the cute ones if you like being tough (48:55 - 48:59)
and battling you can be into that - it's (48:56 - 49:00)
not like you said you don't have to fit (48:59 - 49:04)
a certain mold exactly and I compared to (49:00 - 49:07)
a lot of other games I feel like those (49:04 - 49:09)
can be a lot more linear and a lot more (49:07 - 49:12)
constricting and what I like about (49:09 - 49:14)
Pokemon exactly is that I can play and (49:12 - 49:16)
do a bunch of stuff and then I can go (49:14 - 49:18)
away and then I can come back and (49:16 - 49:20)
there's more stuff (49:18 - 49:22)
- do I know that sometimes if you (49:20 - 49:25)
finished playing a game it's just like (49:22 - 49:27)
you're walking around trying to find (49:25 - 49:30)
stuff to do and I I don't think that's (49:27 - 49:32)
really the case ever with Pokemon so I (49:30 - 49:34)
appreciate that a whole lot if you had (49:32 - 49:36)
to fake a Pokemon that wasn't quite your (49:34 - 49:38)
favorite but it represented you who do (49:36 - 49:40)
you think the Eirene Pokemon is I I (49:38 - 49:44)
can't pick and I and I feel like that is (49:40 - 49:47)
the best answer for me because actually (49:44 - 49:49)
making a selection in deciding is (49:47 - 49:52)
probably OC which is out of character (49:49 - 49:58)
for me so there are hundreds of hundreds (49:52 - 50:00)
of Pokemon almost a thousand and I still (49:58 - 50:05)
can't pick so I can't pick (50:00 - 50:06)
I think that's valid and I think that's (50:05 - 50:07)
kind of interesting too with Pokemon (50:06 - 50:09)
like I feel like you can make a polka (50:07 - 50:11)
team that would best represent you you (50:09 - 50:13)
know elementally maybe six different (50:11 - 50:15)
ones yes and that's another good thing (50:13 - 50:17)
about Pokemon is that you don't have to (50:15 - 50:20)
just pick one type exactly I'm still (50:17 - 50:22)
like I'm gonna try to say my like what (50:20 - 50:27)
am i dead Oh like oh that's such a good (50:22 - 50:29)
answer right like you kind of adapt to (50:27 - 50:32)
every situation that is phenomenal I (50:29 - 50:34)
tried it a I told mark my husband that (50:32 - 50:36)
he was like no you don't copy people (50:34 - 50:38)
make no I don't mean it like that I just (50:36 - 50:41)
mean that you're adaptable you change to (50:38 - 50:43)
fit the situation exactly and it's also (50:41 - 50:44)
kind of like a fake it till you make it (50:43 - 50:46)
type of thing or it's like sometimes I (50:44 - 50:48)
don't know what I'm doing that I just (50:46 - 50:49)
make it up (50:48 - 50:53)
it's gaming code-switching perfect all (50:49 - 50:55)
right I mean do you have any other words (50:53 - 50:57)
of wisdom or messages to pass on for (50:55 - 51:00)
International Women's Day slay continue (50:57 - 51:03)
continue to be your best self and if you (51:00 - 51:05)
don't know what that is continue to try (51:03 - 51:08)
and figure out what that is (51:05 - 51:08)
thank you for listening to this extra (51:08 - 51:12)
special edition I'm Addie on the move (51:11 - 51:15)
this was by far my favorite episode to (51:12 - 51:17)
record I hope that you found some (51:15 - 51:18)
inspiration I listen to these smart (51:17 - 51:21)
amazing funny strong silly warm women (51:18 - 51:23)
then what's common theme I heard talking (51:21 - 51:25)
everybody was that Pokemon such an (51:23 - 51:28)
amazing community because everyone's (51:25 - 51:28)
welcome (51:28 - 51:31)
it gets ounds cheesy but the story that (51:28 - 51:33)
Pokemon tells is that you can be (51:31 - 51:35)
literally anybody and it doesn't matter (51:33 - 51:37)
who you are right exactly at that moment (51:35 - 51:39)
you have every right to earn that (51:37 - 51:41)
champion title as much as anyone else (51:39 - 51:43)
does and since I asked everyone else (51:41 - 51:46)
which Pokemon represents them I suppose (51:43 - 51:49)
I should answer to it was kind of hard (51:46 - 51:51)
Kelly suggested maybe I was my while (51:49 - 51:53)
because I act sweet when I got a big (51:51 - 51:56)
mouth I thought maybe I was dead oh (51:53 - 51:57)
because I like to adapt to new (51:56 - 51:58)
situations (51:57 - 52:01)
mmm but I think I'll pick flabébé my (51:58 - 52:03)
maiden last name is flower so I'm (52:01 - 52:05)
definitely found of a floral theme and (52:03 - 52:07)
I'm a person who loves using herbs and (52:05 - 52:08)
flowers for strengths and taking (52:07 - 52:10)
advantage of their hidden healing (52:08 - 52:12)
properties I thought it was fitting plus (52:10 - 52:14)
it's just really cute and one of the (52:12 - 52:15)
reasons why I love Pokemon it's really (52:14 - 52:18)
cute all right that's it from me I hope (52:15 - 52:20)
everyone has an amazing International (52:18 - 52:22)
Women's Day and we'll see you next time (52:20 - 52:24)
bye (52:22 - 52:27)

used I did not say your favorite Giganta (53:07 - 53:13)
max Pokemon it cannot be used I mean (53:10 - 53:15)
that's probably a shorter list at this (53:13 - 53:18)
point uh what kappa Raja I getting guard (53:15 - 53:20)
Machamp probably some other guys I'm not (53:18 - 53:23)
remembering I don't know why I have such (53:20 - 53:25)
a hard time with the whole Giganta max (53:23 - 53:27)
thing it's like I wish they made it (53:25 - 53:29)
easier to tell just when you're looking (53:27 - 53:31)
in your boxes of like which one's the (53:29 - 53:34)
Giganta max yeah that's why I use the (53:31 - 53:35)
that's why I mark them with the red (53:34 - 53:40)
circle oh we're not against hot garbage (53:35 - 53:44)
marketing system you know you will be (53:40 - 53:45)
matched up to players similar to your (53:44 - 53:47)
rank when the season concludes you learn (53:45 - 53:49)
battle points ability capsules bottle (53:47 - 53:53)
caps etc have fun battling we've talked (53:49 - 53:55)
about this before but I feel like I get (53:53 - 53:58)
this question a lot on Twitter or twitch (53:55 - 53:59)
or whatnot of like how do you have (53:58 - 54:02)
somebody battle points if you make it to (53:59 - 54:06)
master rank in a season and a season is (54:02 - 54:07)
you know a month so beginning of the (54:06 - 54:09)
month to the end of the month if you (54:07 - 54:11)
make the master rank in singles or (54:09 - 54:14)
doubles you will get rewarded with 600 (54:11 - 54:16)
battle points and if you do it in both (54:14 - 54:19)
you get 1200 battle points for you know (54:16 - 54:21)
600 plus 600 1200 and this has been (54:19 - 54:23)
available since the start of the game so (54:21 - 54:26)
if you're you know if you're trying to (54:23 - 54:27)
get in competitive or you're you're (54:26 - 54:29)
going through the tower you are rewarded (54:27 - 54:32)
I think the reward is you're awesome I (54:29 - 54:34)
think 600 battle points for you know (54:32 - 54:36)
just making it to master rank is a (54:34 - 54:39)
pretty great reward it is possible to to (54:36 - 54:41)
have more losses than wins and still (54:39 - 54:42)
make it in (54:41 - 54:44)
- master rank it's possible that way (54:42 - 54:48)
wait so there's no more special berries (54:44 - 54:50)
the the special berries in the game code (54:48 - 54:52)
are given to you through the battle (54:50 - 54:56)
tower not through ranked battles ah ok (54:52 - 55:01)
ok I did make my own team if you so you (54:56 - 55:04)
can't make it to master rank with a (55:01 - 55:06)
rental team you don't have to spend (55:04 - 55:10)
hours or days you know trying to build (55:06 - 55:13)
your own team and Eevee train it and get (55:10 - 55:15)
the right abilities and stuff you can (55:13 - 55:17)
rent a team and I did that for the first (55:15 - 55:20)
three seasons I rented a team I have (55:17 - 55:22)
built my own team now which I am going (55:20 - 55:24)
through the March season with I will put (55:22 - 55:27)
that team in the shownotes it's uh the (55:24 - 55:31)
the whole gimmick of the team is that (55:27 - 55:33)
you have a muds veil which has the (55:31 - 55:36)
ability oblivious I think is what I call (55:33 - 55:39)
it's called so it cannot be confused you (55:36 - 55:41)
cannot have it stats lowered from (55:39 - 55:43)
intimidate and then you use grim snarl (55:41 - 55:45)
with prankster and you use swagger on (55:43 - 55:48)
the muds Dale to increase its attack (55:45 - 55:51)
plus 2 or plus 4 or plus 6 so many times (55:48 - 55:53)
you swagger and then you (55:51 - 55:55)
dynamaxx the muds Dale and then it just (55:53 - 55:57)
wrecks house and group snarl can also (55:55 - 55:59)
set up light screen and reflect as we (55:57 - 56:02)
learn from those awful Mewtwo raids yes (55:59 - 56:04)
yes lights are going to reflect yes so (56:02 - 56:06)
if you don't want to bail a team and you (56:04 - 56:09)
want to try out my team to try to climb (56:06 - 56:12)
master rank doubles that team will be in (56:09 - 56:15)
the show notes for you to check out if (56:12 - 56:17)
you have any questions you know about (56:15 - 56:18)

competitors and organisers is our top (58:07 - 58:11)
priority while will prefer never to see (58:09 - 58:13)
an event get postponed or canceled out (58:11 - 58:16)
of an abundance of caution and by the (58:13 - 58:18)
current recommendations set forth by the (58:16 - 58:20)
public health officials we have canceled (58:18 - 58:22)
the 2020 European international (58:20 - 58:25)
Championships we want to thank the play (58:22 - 58:27)
pokemon community for their continued (58:25 - 58:29)
interest in the competitive events and (58:27 - 58:31)
appreciates everyone support and (58:29 - 58:32)

or follow at play pokemon on twitter for (58:37 - 58:42)
more updates on play pokemon events if (58:40 - 58:44)
you have additional questions you can (58:42 - 58:47)
contact pokemon customer service what (58:44 - 58:50)
play pokemon events are cancelled due to (58:47 - 58:53)
how did they say this kovin 19 Khurana (58:50 - 58:54)
virus Corona (58:53 - 58:58)
of what is it CoV I D so it's corona (58:54 - 59:02)
virus I can't remember what the D is for (58:58 - 59:06)
2019 for the events directly organized (59:02 - 59:08)
by the Pokemon company international we (59:06 - 59:09)
will examine each event by a (59:08 - 59:12)
case-by-case basis information by the (59:09 - 59:14)
latest updates issued by the appropriate (59:12 - 59:16)
government and the World Health (59:14 - 59:19)
Organization recommendations currently (59:16 - 59:21)
there are no plans to propose pone or (59:19 - 59:24)
cancel any of the 2020 Pokemon North (59:21 - 59:25)
America international championships or (59:24 - 59:29)
the 2020 World Championships although (59:25 - 59:30)
there was like a rumor saying that the (59:29 - 59:32)
world championships was going to be (59:30 - 59:33)
canceled like somebody tweeted about (59:32 - 59:36)
this this is literally a Pokemon comm (59:33 - 59:39)
currently there are no plans to postpone (59:36 - 59:42)
or cancel both the International North (59:39 - 59:44)
American Championships or the 2020 World (59:42 - 59:46)
Championships so I'm not sure where that (59:44 - 59:47)
rumor got started (59:46 - 59:49)
however we are closely monitoring the (59:47 - 59:51)
situation and keep we will keep the (59:49 - 59:53)
community updated in real-time on our (59:51 - 59:56)
website and on play Pokemon Twitter (59:53 - 59:59)
should circumstances change we strongly (59:56 - 60:01)
advise attendees volunteers and (59:59 - 60:03)
organizers to follow guidelines and (60:01 - 60:05)
protocols issued by the World Health (60:03 - 60:07)
Organization regarding health and (60:05 - 60:10)
wellness attending mass gatherings next (60:07 - 60:12)
question is should I be concerned about (60:10 - 60:15)
kovat 19 at play Pokemon events while we (60:12 - 60:17)
have no reports directly linking any (60:15 - 60:20)
cases of the virus with our events the (60:17 - 60:22)
safety and well-being of our community (60:20 - 60:24)
both competitors organisers is our top (60:22 - 60:26)
priority we strongly advise all (60:24 - 60:28)
attendees volunteers okay so just (60:26 - 60:30)
repeating what they said earlier if you (60:28 - 60:32)
want more information pokemon comm or (60:30 - 60:37)
support pokemon calm for that so the (60:32 - 60:38)
question is what we keep asking (60:37 - 60:42)
ourselves to is Niantic going to cancel (60:38 - 60:46)
the upcoming Safari Zone in two and a (60:42 - 60:50)
half weeks here and when is Pennsylvania (60:46 - 60:54)
Safari Zone in May the first week of May (60:50 - 60:55)
I think so that's a little farther away (60:54 - 60:58)
the bigger one is the bigger concern is (60:55 - 61:01)
literally the one in two weeks yeah (60:58 - 61:04)
absolutely and even even if it's not (61:01 - 61:07)
canceled I don't know that I want to go (61:04 - 61:11)
you'll be fine I do think the okay so (61:07 - 61:13)
the two things that kind of correspond (61:11 - 61:15)
with this is from what I've been reading (61:13 - 61:17)
and since I work for a large (61:15 - 61:19)
international organization we have to (61:17 - 61:21)
kind of be responsive to this ourselves (61:19 - 61:26)
that the peak season like we're there (61:21 - 61:28)
probably will be the largest (61:26 - 61:31)
distribution of this particular virus or (61:28 - 61:34)
viral infections is going to be late (61:31 - 61:36)
March early April which is when the st. (61:34 - 61:40)
Louis event is scheduled to happen and (61:36 - 61:47)
what I've also heard from a medical type (61:40 - 61:47)
I want to say a physician but not a (61:48 - 61:54)
biologist so this is maybe a little less (61:51 - 61:57)
than accurate but that these type of (61:54 - 61:59)
viruses don't survive well in warmer (61:57 - 62:03)
temperatures so in May when it starts to (61:59 - 62:07)
get warmer that we'll have fewer (62:03 - 62:08)
infections just because this virus (62:07 - 62:12)
doesn't do well in weight managers (62:08 - 62:13)
there's still a lot they don't know (62:12 - 62:18)
right sure like this is this is very (62:13 - 62:22)
very new it's got a long incubation time (62:18 - 62:25)
so it's been very hard to track so it's (62:22 - 62:28)
hard to say exactly what's going to (62:25 - 62:31)
happen but like as another large (62:28 - 62:34)
international company I'm banned from (62:31 - 62:37)
traveling for company reasons they have (62:34 - 62:39)
stopped and cancelled all traveling and (62:37 - 62:44)
a number of teams are being forced to (62:39 - 62:47)
work from home it's a big deal and I (62:44 - 62:49)
would really like something from Niantic (62:47 - 62:53)
soon yes agree yeah it's funny because I (62:49 - 62:55)
talk to so many people every day through (62:53 - 62:58)
through twitch chat and I feel like most (62:55 - 63:02)
one way not to catch if I I'm very safe (62:58 - 63:04)
through twitch chat it's funny how (63:02 - 63:07)
Milwaukee has feels like the opposite of (63:04 - 63:09)
the rest of the world in this and I I (63:07 - 63:12)
I'm not downplaying you know other (63:09 - 63:17)
cities or other states but I have gone (63:12 - 63:19)
out recently I did Darkrai this weekend (63:17 - 63:21)
went to a couple grocery stores you (63:19 - 63:23)
we still have plenty of hand sanitizer (63:21 - 63:26)
no one's stocking up on water there's (63:23 - 63:28)
plenty of like everything and it just (63:26 - 63:31)
seems like my wife and I were at the (63:28 - 63:32)
mall yesterday and it was just packed (63:31 - 63:35)
and the entire time I was thinking like (63:32 - 63:39)
okay as soon as I get back to my car I'm (63:35 - 63:41)
gonna douse myself in hand sanitizer as (63:39 - 63:42)
soon as I Drive home I'm gonna wash my (63:41 - 63:45)
hands I'm gonna try not to touch (63:42 - 63:48)
anything because I just went there to do (63:45 - 63:51)
a regigigas raid and then leave but like (63:48 - 63:53)
it just from talking to people who work (63:51 - 63:55)
at Walgreens in other country or in (63:53 - 64:00)
other states or targets or Walmart's and (63:55 - 64:01)
other cities it just sounds like they're (64:00 - 64:05)
out of everything and probably because (64:01 - 64:07)
there's I think there hasn't been a case (64:05 - 64:09)
in Milwaukee at all yet but it just (64:07 - 64:12)
seems like Milwaukee is like this other (64:09 - 64:14)
part of the world country where there's (64:12 - 64:18)
like not a care in the world here around (64:14 - 64:20)
me I haven't noticed any runs on (64:18 - 64:25)
anything Oh see we live in the city my (64:20 - 64:27)
family who lives up the suburbs are (64:25 - 64:29)
sending pictures of all the panicky (64:27 - 64:32)
people in their suburban suburban world (64:29 - 64:34)
who part of the reason why you're out in (64:32 - 64:35)
the suburbs because you don't see people (64:34 - 64:38)
but their arrogance their targets are (64:35 - 64:41)
cleared out and like we just went (64:38 - 64:43)
shopping today and all of our stuff is (64:41 - 64:46)
fine it's like all of these panicky (64:43 - 64:48)
people out the suburbs are like oh I (64:46 - 64:51)
might run into somebody I better buy (64:48 - 64:54)
fifty thousand things of toilet paper (64:51 - 64:56)
it's like get real (64:54 - 64:58)
we've had one confirmed case in (64:56 - 65:01)
Minnesota and that person was very smart (64:58 - 65:05)
and self-quarantine themselves and they (65:01 - 65:07)
were in st. Paul so really I'm the only (65:05 - 65:09)
one who's that race paper you get up a (65:07 - 65:13)
day oh no you couldn't even get that to (65:09 - 65:13)
work (65:13 - 65:16)
I gotta have a working bird a will and (65:13 - 65:21)
also I want I never got to use it I want (65:16 - 65:24)
to what is it you would call out when (65:21 - 65:27)
you have to say Amalfi's er give give (65:24 - 65:30)
name to malfeasance list (65:27 - 65:34)
lifetime fitness I leave my house once a (65:30 - 65:37)
day I literally spend my entire day (65:34 - 65:40)
bolon leave my house go to the gym and (65:37 - 65:42)
come back home how did I get the flu (65:40 - 65:49)
last week you are membership we played (65:42 - 65:53)
magic like two weeks ago Oh true (65:49 - 65:56)
don't blame your gym although you can (65:53 - 65:57)
blame lifetime because they're kind of (65:56 - 66:01)
garbage you people but yeah Irene Irene (65:57 - 66:04)
and I are trying to plan a trip in in (66:01 - 66:09)
mid-may so mmm get those plane tickets (66:04 - 66:12)
while they're cheap before yeah we've (66:09 - 66:14)
booked some stuff it's all it's all (66:12 - 66:16)
technically refund refundable and I (66:14 - 66:17)
don't think I would ever book an (66:16 - 66:19)
international flight without some kind (66:17 - 66:23)
of insurance slash you know these (66:19 - 66:25)
tickets I would never book an (66:23 - 66:27)
international non-refundable flight let (66:25 - 66:31)
me reword it that way so I don't think (66:27 - 66:35)
we're specifically worried about getting (66:31 - 66:37)
sick we're both you know we we're both (66:35 - 66:40)
young and very healthy and and whatnot I (66:37 - 66:42)
think we're more worried about going to (66:40 - 66:44)
a place and everything just being closed (66:42 - 66:48)
I think that's that the worry is like we (66:44 - 66:51)
travel a thousand miles and you're (66:48 - 66:54)
finally there and the theme park or (66:51 - 66:58)
something is closed for you know a month (66:54 - 67:00)
or a week or a weekend or that's that's (66:58 - 67:02)
what we're really worried about and you (67:00 - 67:03)
know if we have to delay or cancel our (67:02 - 67:07)
trip that's fine it's just totally (67:03 - 67:09)
understand so the company that makes (67:07 - 67:13)
Vanguard basically in Japan have told (67:09 - 67:16)
people to stop having shop tournaments (67:13 - 67:18)
for the trading card game and they have (67:16 - 67:22)
set up a discord where people can go on (67:18 - 67:26)
the discord and set up matches where (67:22 - 67:28)
they do like which is what I do for (67:26 - 67:30)
playing Vanguard Italy like you take a (67:28 - 67:32)
webcam and just point it at your play (67:30 - 67:34)
mat and then you do matches that way and (67:32 - 67:37)
they're literally giving promos and (67:34 - 67:40)
everything and they're giving face masks (67:37 - 67:42)
to all the card shops so that people (67:40 - 67:44)
don't go to the card shops to play (67:42 - 67:47)
yeah I think it's I mean I I think it's (67:44 - 67:49)
smart to just have people work at home (67:47 - 67:51)
for the next month or delay school or (67:49 - 67:55)
whatnot it's I mean I've been saying (67:51 - 68:00)
work at home since September so I don't (67:55 - 68:01)
know I guess the only thing we can do is (68:00 - 68:03)
monitor it but we're not a we're not a (68:01 - 68:07)

people around me who we're playing it (71:00 - 71:04)
where you know I could talk about it and (71:02 - 71:07)

interested but kind of just doing it (71:07 - 71:13)
completely solo is it's not enough for (71:10 - 71:16)
me to go back to that particular story (71:13 - 71:19)

major differences here I would love to (72:59 - 73:03)

I'm not I forget things so that's back (74:19 - 74:28)
that's it that's uh that's that's all (74:25 - 74:29)
the news this week a little bit light (74:28 - 74:33)
but we'll do you have our Pokemon of the (74:29 - 74:35)
week wait we don't have a question of (74:33 - 74:37)
the week well all questions next week Oh (74:35 - 74:42)
dag well okay dang sprung it on me okay (74:37 - 74:45)
and Pokemon of the week but last week's (74:42 - 74:48)
Pokemon was a poem called sunkern the (74:45 - 74:50)
goth corn prince and if that can give (74:48 - 74:53)
you the answer right there I so the (74:50 - 74:56)
clues from the poem were that sunkern (74:53 - 74:58)
used to have the lowest combined stat (74:56 - 75:01)
total of all Pokemon but it doesn't any (74:58 - 75:05)
longer the Pokemon that does have the (75:01 - 75:10)
lowest combined stat total has an (75:05 - 75:13)
ability that cannot be removed by mommy (75:10 - 75:16)
but can be removed by wandering spirit (75:13 - 75:19)
and there's a clue in the poem where it (75:16 - 75:23)
says ground has taken a lesson from the (75:19 - 75:24)
ocean (75:23 - 75:28)
and that ability goes into effect as (75:24 - 75:30)
long as your Pokemon is over level 20 (75:28 - 75:36)
and over 25% HP and that's pretty much (75:30 - 75:37)
all the clues you need now come on (75:36 - 75:44)
who's the Pokemon it's sunkern was not (75:37 - 75:47)
sunkern it's wishy-washy (75:44 - 75:51)
it's wishy-washy you are 100% correct (75:47 - 75:51)
wishy-washy now has the lowest combined (75:52 - 75:56)
set to base that total of all Pokemon (75:54 - 75:58)
there's actually somebody else also (75:56 - 76:01)
below so wishy-washy and sunkern so (75:58 - 76:04)
they're slipping them in all over the (76:01 - 76:08)
place but yes wishy-washys ability is (76:04 - 76:12)
called schooling schooling and it's it's (76:08 - 76:14)
gold that's dramatically changed when (76:12 - 76:17)
it's in school form or solo form goes (76:14 - 76:20)
from solo form is based at total 175 (76:17 - 76:26)
school form base stat total 620 and it (76:20 - 76:28)
can only activate that ability if it's (76:26 - 76:32)
over level 20 and over 25% HP (76:28 - 76:36)
so once it drops below 25% HP then it on (76:32 - 76:39)
the schools if it drops below 25% but (76:36 - 76:41)
then like gets health back does it Reese (76:39 - 76:46)
cool oh I do but I don't know I don't (76:41 - 76:51)
know that's just on your stream yeah I (76:46 - 76:53)
guess because I know a streamer I (76:51 - 76:57)
normally see this computer players use (76:53 - 76:59)
wishy-washy I never really seen like he (76:57 - 77:01)
wishy-washy holding like a citrus berry (76:59 - 77:03)
or something (77:01 - 77:06)
how interesting somebody's got to try it (77:03 - 77:09)
somebody already has somebody knows no I (77:06 - 77:13)
just the you know the trivia of you know (77:09 - 77:17)

ready I'm ready yeah you may not have (77:31 - 77:37)
realized this but until you complete the (77:34 - 77:39)
full story of pokemon sword and shield (77:37 - 77:43)
there is no night your entire adventure (77:39 - 77:46)
exists solely in the daylight hours no (77:43 - 77:48)
matter what time of day it actually is (77:46 - 77:50)
while you are playing why did they do (77:48 - 77:54)
this they did this because they wanted (77:50 - 77:56)
to keep you from obtaining one of the (77:54 - 78:00)
best Pokemon ever designed it isn't any (77:56 - 78:01)
of these Pokemon (78:00 - 78:05)
aurorus Chimecho a lowly marowak gliscor (78:01 - 78:07)
obstacle a little and Radek eight like (78:05 - 78:08)
in Rock Weavile (78:07 - 78:10)
or Frost moth why are there so many dark (78:08 - 78:12)
types that evolve only at night with (78:10 - 78:13)
high friendship (78:12 - 78:16)
why did Game Freak keep us from (78:13 - 78:18)
obtaining this Pokemon until the game (78:16 - 78:21)
was over I suppose you could find one at (78:18 - 78:23)
the lake of outrage you can't get there (78:21 - 78:25)
though until later in the game and there (78:23 - 78:27)
has to be a sandstorm going on at the (78:25 - 78:29)
time this week's Pokemon shares its (78:27 - 78:32)
ability with its psychic cousin although (78:29 - 78:34)
it is mostly super effective against (78:32 - 78:36)
that dude all right there you go that's (78:34 - 78:42)
enough clues for always sure frost mop (78:36 - 78:46)
no it's not frost moth Oh fry spot is my (78:42 - 78:50)
favorite I thought mom was your favorite (78:46 - 78:53)
ex Nam to their omelet (78:50 - 78:56)
oh you know what we we didn't really (78:53 - 78:58)
take this in consideration or maybe we (78:56 - 78:59)
did it I cut it I cut a lot of stuff (78:58 - 79:01)
from last week's episode because it was (78:59 - 79:03)
so long yeah you making a sound bed (79:01 - 79:06)
youth your edits no no no no no no no no (79:03 - 79:09)
no no no no way Wow release the (79:06 - 79:15)
director's cut for the Pokemon of the (79:09 - 79:16)
year (79:15 - 79:18)
thing we didn't really talk about is the (79:16 - 79:21)
amount of Pokemon that were split so (79:18 - 79:25)
like for example in in Kanto there were (79:21 - 79:27)
there are a hundred and fifty-one (79:25 - 79:30)
Pokemon to vote on but in but in Kalos (79:27 - 79:33)
there's only like 78 Pokemon to vote on (79:30 - 79:36)
so does that give greninja just an (79:33 - 79:39)
unfair advantage because there's less (79:36 - 79:41)
what do they call that in in politics (79:39 - 79:43)
where like a third party you like splits (79:41 - 79:48)
the vote but no that's a spoiler but (79:43 - 79:50)
like there's a bunch of useless Pokemon (79:48 - 79:51)
that we're taking away votes from (79:50 - 79:56)
Charizard but now but but it's it's I (79:51 - 79:58)
think it was like the overall number of (79:56 - 80:01)
votes right right you could vote every (79:58 - 80:04)
day so each section like you could go in (80:01 - 80:06)
each session you didn't have to vote in (80:04 - 80:08)
each section that's true so if it was (80:06 - 80:09)
mandatory I would say yes it was (80:08 - 80:12)
mandatory to vote in each section but it (80:09 - 80:15)
wasn't because they were fewer to pick (80:12 - 80:17)
from there doesn't mean like if you look (80:15 - 80:18)
at the numbers they put out underneath (80:17 - 80:21)
how many people voted for those clearly (80:18 - 80:22)
a lot of people went in there and (80:21 - 80:24)
clicked on that one where like they (80:22 - 80:27)
didn't for all of you Nova because you (80:24 - 80:30)
Nova only starts at 50,000 votes yeah (80:27 - 80:33)
you know and Genova has 156 writing on (80:30 - 80:37)
them so did it play a factor maybe like (80:33 - 80:41)
there's a lot of choices to go in that (80:37 - 80:44)
area so people would have more to choose (80:41 - 80:47)
from but if they didn't like any in that (80:44 - 80:49)
section they wouldn't vote for that (80:47 - 80:51)
section because it wasn't like you had (80:49 - 80:53)
to complete each one you could have just (80:51 - 80:55)
gotten into Kanto and clicked on (80:53 - 80:57)
Charizard and done none of the others (80:55 - 80:59)
and that would have counted yeah that's (80:57 - 81:03)
true so I don't I mean I don't think it (80:59 - 81:09)
played a big enough factor to say that (81:03 - 81:12)
you know it's Virginia came out on top (81:09 - 81:14)
because it split the vote like that (81:12 - 81:15)
because there were so few in that (81:14 - 81:17)
generation like that's I don't think (81:15 - 81:20)
that's a factor that people looked at I (81:17 - 81:23)
think it was much more of a I'm sure (81:20 - 81:25)
there was some people that thought they (81:23 - 81:26)
had to vote for every one thing and they (81:25 - 81:28)
got to Jem six and they were like I (81:26 - 81:32)
don't know grinning joke cuz I don't (81:28 - 81:33)
know who else I like in this Jen (81:32 - 81:37)
maybe I that's sort of a hard thing to (81:33 - 81:39)
quantify it writing I think it's hard to (81:37 - 81:43)
say yeah absolutely but if you look at (81:39 - 81:46)
the raw votes they just they just came (81:43 - 81:48)
out with way more votes pure numbers (81:46 - 81:52)
wise like there was a lot more we'll be (81:48 - 81:55)
