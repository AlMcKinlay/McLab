normal level excitement for scarlet and (0:41 - 0:45)
violet oh okay we've moved through the (0:43 - 0:48)
dread I got my OLED I got it all set up (0:45 - 0:50)
which (0:48 - 0:53)
you know re-downloading all the game jam (0:50 - 0:57)
on a switch is not a fun thing to do (0:53 - 1:00)
I went through that Journey as well also (0:57 - 1:03)
it's a nightmare odd fact uh the switch (1:00 - 1:06)
like destroys your internet when it's (1:03 - 1:08)
downloading games yeah like it it (1:06 - 1:11)
prioritized everything I might work and (1:08 - 1:13)
I was like what yeah so I was trying I'm (1:11 - 1:15)
like well I'll just watch somebody (1:13 - 1:18)
streaming while this is downloading and (1:15 - 1:20)
my internet in the switch said guess (1:18 - 1:22)
again buddy I'm meeting all your (1:20 - 1:24)
bandwidth yeah it was Unreal I know (1:22 - 1:26)
steam does that on PC it'll be like (1:24 - 1:29)
steam is like no I am number one I (1:26 - 1:31)
didn't think the switch would be like I (1:29 - 1:32)
thought the switch would be like still (1:31 - 1:35)
ancient technology from like 2008 and it (1:32 - 1:37)
would be like the last priority on your (1:35 - 1:38)
network now the switch is like I need to (1:37 - 1:41)
be number one you know LED says give me (1:38 - 1:43)
give me give me your bandwidth baby (1:41 - 1:49)
uh will is also here I need everybody to (1:43 - 1:52)
stop what you're doing immediately pull (1:49 - 1:55)
over your car to the side of the road if (1:52 - 1:56)
you're on the highway whatever it gets (1:55 - 1:58)
to a safe location (1:56 - 2:05)
go to change.org slash Rogers yes we'll (1:58 - 2:08)
know I've started a position petition (2:05 - 2:12)
okay to have Roger's base permanently (2:08 - 2:15)
replace me on this program (2:12 - 2:17)
because (2:15 - 2:20)
he clearly had a level of energy that I (2:17 - 2:23)
have not had in 30 years minimum (2:20 - 2:27)
possibly your entire life I have met you (2:23 - 2:30)
and I can't even imagine I I can't (2:27 - 2:32)
imagine you as a teenager given how we (2:30 - 2:34)
know how the 80s were I can't imagine (2:32 - 2:36)
you having energy as a teenager I (2:34 - 2:38)
believe when I was like six seven eight (2:36 - 2:42)
years old I was very excited and full of (2:38 - 2:44)
life child when nine hit that's when (2:42 - 2:45)
things started that yeah that's that's (2:44 - 2:47)
what it all went out the window Rogers (2:45 - 2:50)
yes will no all right I'm looking it up (2:47 - 2:52)
right now how do I sign Roger does have (2:50 - 2:54)
a lot of energy he he has that YouTuber (2:52 - 2:56)
in him (2:54 - 2:59)
which YouTubers you know (2:56 - 3:01)
he has that he has that YouTuber hey (2:59 - 3:04)
there's a brand new Pokemon there is uh (3:01 - 3:05)
I actually got announced like three (3:04 - 3:08)
hours before recording this podcast so (3:05 - 3:10)
that's convenient (3:08 - 3:12)
I actually expected the news to come out (3:10 - 3:13)
like Monday or Tuesday because it's the (3:12 - 3:17)
weekend and you know Pokemon go and all (3:13 - 3:19)
that stuff so uh the show is pretty much (3:17 - 3:20)
we're gonna talk about the new Pokemon (3:19 - 3:22)
we're gonna talk about Pokemon go which (3:20 - 3:24)
we actually I I don't think we've had (3:22 - 3:25)
Pokemon go news in like two weeks I mean (3:24 - 3:28)
we we have we just ignored it yeah um (3:25 - 3:30)
and then we have some merchandise stuff (3:28 - 3:32)
to talk about which I feel like (3:30 - 3:35)
the merchandise part of this show has (3:32 - 3:37)
really taken over I you know there was a (3:35 - 3:39)
there was a couple of I felt like years (3:37 - 3:43)
where we were very Pokemon go dominated (3:39 - 3:45)
um and now I feel like every episode is (3:43 - 3:46)
just like this is the collaboration (3:45 - 3:48)
they're doing what did we talk about (3:46 - 3:51)
last episode that was merchandise (3:48 - 3:53)
uh uh I don't think there was anything (3:51 - 3:55)
last episode (3:53 - 3:57)
taking over it's not every episode for (3:55 - 4:01)
like 8 000 years it was go every episode (3:57 - 4:03)
and I also don't believe that the (4:01 - 4:05)
merchandise segment has been the same (4:03 - 4:09)
since was it Evie lover oh (4:05 - 4:12)
I love her (4:09 - 4:16)
is Togepi lover (4:12 - 4:16)
um well I guess let's start off with the (4:18 - 4:22)
the first news there's a new (4:20 - 4:26)
uh and it has a name uh where yesterday (4:22 - 4:28)
it did not have a name yesterday its (4:26 - 4:31)
name was coinbase or crypto.com (4:28 - 4:33)
we called it crypto we called it (4:31 - 4:35)
cryptomon as we were walking around the (4:33 - 4:38)
mall yeah really thought there wasn't (4:35 - 4:41)
much if there was any any time that (4:38 - 4:42)
Pokemon was going to get into nfts or (4:41 - 4:46)
crypto Pokemon carrying a coin but (4:42 - 4:49)
a coin that I still say (4:46 - 4:53)
looks like bronzer oh I agree I agree (4:49 - 4:55)
I'm calling it I'm calling the coins pal (4:53 - 4:57)
day and bronzer that that all the (4:55 - 4:59)
bronzer died in paldea and they just (4:57 - 5:01)
turned them into coins this is my (4:59 - 5:04)
running Theory now is smelting is that (5:01 - 5:06)
the word smelting they melted them down (5:04 - 5:08)
into coins (5:06 - 5:11)
well no that's not what that is but (5:08 - 5:13)
let's just proceed (5:11 - 5:16)
smelting is a whole other thing (5:13 - 5:19)
uh so the Pokemon's name is gimme ghoul (5:16 - 5:22)
give me give me give me that cool after (5:19 - 5:25)
bit oh no how dare you (5:22 - 5:28)
this is Brittany Britney's time (5:25 - 5:31)
Britney's three gimme gimme goo no give (5:28 - 5:34)
me ghoul no (5:31 - 5:36)
that's that's the energy of the show (5:34 - 5:39)
isn't it yeah that (5:36 - 5:42)
uh so we we know there's two forms uh (5:39 - 5:45)
there's chess form uh which is what (5:42 - 5:46)
they're introducing here on the website (5:45 - 5:49)
uh pokemon.com and then there's roaming (5:46 - 5:52)
Farm we'll get to in a second uh on the (5:49 - 5:54)
website further down if you go to the (5:52 - 5:56)
official page they do have the roaming (5:54 - 5:59)
forms yeah yeah uh but they're giving us (5:56 - 6:01)
the weight ability that stuff for only (5:59 - 6:03)
chess form we don't know if (6:01 - 6:05)
roaming form has a different ability (6:03 - 6:07)
well we don't know because nobody in pal (6:05 - 6:09)
day has ever caught it so how would they (6:07 - 6:11)
know (6:09 - 6:11)
uh (6:11 - 6:15)
with no one in paldaya has caught (6:13 - 6:18)
roaming roaming for him so we don't have (6:15 - 6:20)
any stats for it so I can't see yes you (6:18 - 6:23)
can make it up we have the coin chest (6:20 - 6:27)
Pokemon it is pure Ghost type it is one (6:23 - 6:30)
foot tall that's American it's 11 pounds (6:27 - 6:32)
that's also American and has the ability (6:30 - 6:33)
rattled (6:32 - 6:36)
and it says these gimme ghoul hide (6:33 - 6:40)
inside sturdy treasure chests uh while (6:36 - 6:42)
this Pro provides them a solid defense (6:40 - 6:45)
the treasure chest weight causes gimme (6:42 - 6:47)
ghoul to move slowly making travel (6:45 - 6:50)
difficult it's not uncommon for chest (6:47 - 6:52)
form gimme ghoul to be mistaken for uh (6:50 - 6:55)
an antique and taking home or sold to (6:52 - 6:58)
antique stores (6:55 - 6:58)
that's that's a paragraph sure uh (7:02 - 7:07)
gimmigo controls people and Pokemon (7:05 - 7:10)
making them collect coins when gimme (7:07 - 7:12)
ghoul senses a person or Pokemon draw (7:10 - 7:14)
near it ambushes them it will use the (7:12 - 7:16)
Ghost type energy to control its Target (7:14 - 7:18)
forcing them to collect coins (7:16 - 7:21)
is that supposed to be like uh (7:18 - 7:24)
our experience yesterday in Pogo yeah (7:21 - 7:25)
because it didn't work on YouTube you (7:24 - 7:27)
guys were like seeing we're like well (7:25 - 7:29)
yeah but I also didn't collect any coins (7:27 - 7:32)
I spun a bunch of the golden polka stops (7:29 - 7:34)
and I didn't get any coins I got one and (7:32 - 7:36)
then I was like oh I spent like 50 and I (7:34 - 7:39)
ended up only getting like 10. uh (7:36 - 7:40)
because it often hides in warehouses (7:39 - 7:42)
shop corners or other places people (7:40 - 7:44)
don't uh people or Pokemon don't (7:42 - 7:46)
frequent it tends to keep persistent (7:44 - 7:49)
control over those it does manage to (7:46 - 7:51)
encounter (7:49 - 7:52)
um and if you watch like the one minute (7:51 - 7:54)
trailer it kind of shows like a new area (7:52 - 7:57)
of the game which is like they I don't (7:54 - 7:59)
know like a (7:57 - 8:02)
torn down Castle area it had a ruins (7:59 - 8:04)
feel to it it was kind of hitting over (8:02 - 8:08)
in the ruins was this little chest (8:04 - 8:10)
uh so I have a couple questions uh (8:08 - 8:12)
before we get to the Pokemon Go part uh (8:10 - 8:14)
is this gonna be like the volt orb of (8:12 - 8:16)
the game where some chess give you like (8:14 - 8:19)
rewards and then some you know what I'm (8:16 - 8:21)
talking about like how like voltar was (8:19 - 8:22)
just a Pokeball and some pokeballs you (8:21 - 8:23)
picked up and then someone (8:22 - 8:25)
um maybe I mean because there's that (8:23 - 8:28)
whole Treasure Chest Treasure Quest feel (8:25 - 8:32)
so I wouldn't put it past them to be (8:28 - 8:34)
like there are Treasure Chest scattered (8:32 - 8:36)
about and sometimes there's a gimme (8:34 - 8:37)
ghoul in it (8:36 - 8:40)
but that's like two gimmicks Pokemon can (8:37 - 8:43)
only have one gimmick per Pokemon can't (8:40 - 8:45)
have two gimmicks (8:43 - 8:49)
uh yeah but but it's a whole new world (8:45 - 8:51)
we're living in it's a whole new place (8:49 - 8:53)
to see true (8:51 - 8:57)
it's not always black and white (8:53 - 9:04)
uh number two is I I stand by that (8:57 - 9:06)
no one should be predicting Pokemon (9:04 - 9:08)
types because everyone is always wrong (9:06 - 9:10)
and the amount of people that saw this (9:08 - 9:11)
okay so this Pokemon was in the original (9:10 - 9:13)
this Pokemon was in the 14 minute (9:11 - 9:15)
trailer (9:13 - 9:19)
yeah like menu when the trainer is (9:15 - 9:20)
trying to take a selfie so we've seen (9:19 - 9:23)
this Pokemon before and then it was the (9:20 - 9:25)
data miners because Pokemon go has to (9:23 - 9:27)
update at a reasonable time in order for (9:25 - 9:30)
it to be pushed worldwide Dane miners (9:27 - 9:32)
were like look at this new Pokemon (9:30 - 9:33)
um (9:32 - 9:35)
and everyone was like oh it's a bug type (9:33 - 9:37)
and back in that trailer people were (9:35 - 9:39)
like book type it's not a bug type it's (9:37 - 9:42)
ghost but I can understand the bug part (9:39 - 9:47)
it's got dowsing rods for antennas uh (9:42 - 9:50)
is is this based off something is this (9:47 - 9:54)
like a d d thing is this like uh well so (9:50 - 9:57)
like a loot gobbles from Diablo the (9:54 - 10:01)
mimic is a monstrosity that masquerades (9:57 - 10:05)
as a chest that's like a standard DND (10:01 - 10:07)
thing but (10:05 - 10:09)
there's not like a mind controlling (10:07 - 10:11)
mimic mimics just grab you and eat you (10:09 - 10:14)
that's that's their thing they're hiding (10:11 - 10:16)
and then you get close and it's big icky (10:14 - 10:18)
sticky tongue comes out and grabs you (10:16 - 10:19)
and swallows you in and eats you and (10:18 - 10:21)
you're never seen again (10:19 - 10:23)
I mean I did think oh it's the mimic (10:21 - 10:25)
because of the way they describe the (10:23 - 10:26)
chest and you open up and sometimes (10:25 - 10:28)
there's a gimme ghoul in it but other (10:26 - 10:32)
than that no it's not really a thing (10:28 - 10:33)
I just don't know why it kind of looks (10:32 - 10:36)
like a bug (10:33 - 10:36)
like the design is still confusing (10:36 - 10:42)
Greg it's got the Dallas it's got the (10:40 - 10:45)
item finder dowsing rods oh that's what (10:42 - 10:47)
it's supposed to be and its tail is a (10:45 - 10:49)
little latching to hold on to a coin (10:47 - 10:51)
yeah his tail is a money clip (10:49 - 10:54)
its eyes are the gold coins (10:51 - 10:56)
um I liked the design (10:54 - 10:59)
I didn't like it in Pokemon go yesterday (10:56 - 11:00)
because they couldn't see the smile it's (10:59 - 11:04)
very tiny today I saw the smile on my (11:00 - 11:06)
soul I'm sold on this thing (11:04 - 11:10)
I'm in it doesn't raise the rating it's (11:06 - 11:15)
not a grivard situation but I'm into it (11:10 - 11:15)
uh it's very cute yeah it's cute uh I (11:16 - 11:22)
wish his hands were (11:20 - 11:25)
more defined instead of weird putty (11:22 - 11:27)
things (11:25 - 11:29)
uh it says gimme ghoul's roaming form it (11:27 - 11:31)
seems like gimme ghoul has a second form (11:29 - 11:33)
uh this kind of gaming gold doesn't hide (11:31 - 11:36)
in a treasure chest it's a small carries (11:33 - 11:38)
a single coin on its back and it seems (11:36 - 11:40)
to be fine uh it seems it can be found (11:38 - 11:43)
all over paldaya (11:40 - 11:45)
however since they run away as soon as a (11:43 - 11:47)
person approaches it seems not a single (11:45 - 11:50)
trainer in paldea has ever managed to (11:47 - 11:51)
catch one (11:50 - 11:53)
surprisingly roaming form gimme ghoul (11:51 - 11:55)
has been spotted in the world of Pokemon (11:53 - 11:58)
go as well it appears that Mr Jacques an (11:55 - 12:00)
expert on the biology of Pokemon in the (11:58 - 12:02)
paldeo region and Professor Willow who (12:00 - 12:04)
have been carrying alongside the (12:02 - 12:06)
research for trainers in the world of (12:04 - 12:08)
Pokemon go have joined forces to devise (12:06 - 12:11)
a way to catch them please wait for (12:08 - 12:12)
future announcements to hear about the (12:11 - 12:14)
results (12:12 - 12:14)
um and then somebody on the self Road (12:15 - 12:20)
was a bless their heart they tried to (12:17 - 12:23)
collect as many coins as possible and (12:20 - 12:25)
they got up to a hundred and the game (12:23 - 12:27)
did not let them collect anymore a fun (12:25 - 12:29)
fact about those coins they do take up (12:27 - 12:31)
an inventory space sure (12:29 - 12:34)
in your uh menu so uh that's just a (12:31 - 12:36)
hundred inventory slots (12:34 - 12:40)
for who knows how long or what that is (12:36 - 12:42)
actually gonna do I'm I'm I'm a bit (12:40 - 12:45)
envious I kind of want 100 coins but at (12:42 - 12:47)
the same time it's I'm sure it's (12:45 - 12:49)
probably not going to matter at all no (12:47 - 12:54)
you need 999 to evolve it Grim the (12:49 - 12:56)
wandering form into the chest form (12:54 - 12:59)
yeah that could be I mean people are (12:56 - 13:01)
getting the 9.99 from the from the (12:59 - 13:04)
website from the chest.pokemon.com or (13:01 - 13:05)
whatever it was that was running (13:04 - 13:07)
yesterday yeah so I don't know if that's (13:05 - 13:11)
going to be also in the um (13:07 - 13:13)
in the video the story of the video girl (13:11 - 13:17)
she threw at 999 coins and then the Grim (13:13 - 13:21)
gimme ghoul contributed the last coin (13:17 - 13:23)
and then she was free then he was set (13:21 - 13:25)
free and doesn't remember anything about (13:23 - 13:28)
the last 15 years of her life is that (13:25 - 13:29)
not just literally the spirit team (13:28 - 13:34)
storyline in Legends yeah kinda (13:29 - 13:34)
foreign (13:34 - 13:37)
just like I'm gonna possess you and make (13:41 - 13:46)
you treasure hunt for me while I sit in (13:44 - 13:49)
the corner of this dark and antique (13:46 - 13:51)
store (13:49 - 13:51)
um (13:52 - 13:54)
so (13:53 - 13:57)
also not surprising and a thing I think (13:54 - 14:00)
we need to talk about is using Pokemon (13:57 - 14:05)
go again to advertise (14:00 - 14:08)
your main Series game and vice versa I I (14:05 - 14:11)
would be curious and there's no way to (14:08 - 14:13)
ever know because the Pokemon company (14:11 - 14:15)
will never release numbers (14:13 - 14:16)
um (14:15 - 14:19)
I'd be curious of how many Pokemon sword (14:16 - 14:22)
and shield fans or let's go Pikachu (14:19 - 14:23)
let's go Eevee fans (14:22 - 14:26)
because technically both of those games (14:23 - 14:27)
work (14:26 - 14:32)
went decided just to play go for meltan (14:27 - 14:35)
because you need like if you're if (14:32 - 14:36)
you're there to collect the Pokedex (14:35 - 14:38)
right like you either need to trade for (14:36 - 14:41)
maltan or you need to play Pokemon go uh (14:38 - 14:43)
yeah and I think the barrier to entry of (14:41 - 14:46)
getting meltan was relatively low (14:43 - 14:48)
I mean you didn't have to be like a (14:46 - 14:50)
level 40 player you just had to send a (14:48 - 14:52)
Pokemon over open the box catch them I'm (14:50 - 14:54)
gonna argue it's a small percentage (14:52 - 14:56)
right but (14:54 - 14:58)
you don't need a big percentage of (14:56 - 15:00)
people like and I know one Pokemon go (14:58 - 15:02)
player who literally sent their Pokemon (15:00 - 15:06)
to my version of Let's Go Pikachu to get (15:02 - 15:08)
the box (15:06 - 15:10)
they weren't gonna buy their own (15:08 - 15:12)
you talked about this Greg a while ago I (15:10 - 15:15)
can't believe I remembered this uh but (15:12 - 15:18)
at that Park not the park the weird the (15:15 - 15:21)
Victory Road Victory Memorial yeah you (15:18 - 15:23)
said there was like a tent and people (15:21 - 15:24)
would bring their switch and then there (15:23 - 15:26)
would be like a line of people that (15:24 - 15:28)
would just want to get the meltan thing (15:26 - 15:32)
so yeah obviously there were there was (15:28 - 15:35)
uh no I don't want to use the word (15:32 - 15:36)
excitement but there were there were (15:35 - 15:38)
people that wanted it yeah I mean I mean (15:36 - 15:40)
I would say like with any of these (15:38 - 15:41)
things you're looking at probably about (15:40 - 15:44)
five percent of your fan base well we'll (15:41 - 15:47)
do the thing but five percent is enough (15:44 - 15:50)
to make it worth your while for like for (15:47 - 15:52)
very little effort (15:50 - 15:53)
to be like we're including this thing (15:52 - 15:55)
and then you're gonna have to interact (15:53 - 15:58)
with both and if you if you get (15:55 - 16:01)
just five percent of those people (15:58 - 16:04)
as new customers that was worth what (16:01 - 16:07)
what honestly is a limited amount of (16:04 - 16:10)
marketing budget that they spend right (16:07 - 16:11)
like (16:10 - 16:16)
they didn't have to do a whole lot yeah (16:11 - 16:16)
I I (16:18 - 16:23)
so we we did Community day yesterday at (16:20 - 16:25)
the good old Mall of America very packed (16:23 - 16:27)
yesterday (16:25 - 16:31)
um Dratini Dratini was the (16:27 - 16:34)
second third ever third Community Day I (16:31 - 16:35)
think I think it was Pikachu Bulbasaur (16:34 - 16:37)
Dratini (16:35 - 16:39)
and then maybe like Mareep (16:37 - 16:41)
um (16:39 - 16:43)
so it's it's been like four years since (16:41 - 16:48)
uh the original Dratini community (16:43 - 16:49)
um (16:48 - 16:51)
I had an okay time (16:49 - 16:53)
I don't think it had anything to do with (16:51 - 16:55)
Dratini I think it just has to do with (16:53 - 16:57)
Community Days or walk in a circle and (16:55 - 16:59)
catch a bunch of Pokemon and (16:57 - 17:01)
um (16:59 - 17:06)
you know grind it out very grindy uh but (17:01 - 17:09)
I I think for me it was like I'm very (17:06 - 17:11)
excited for this coin Pokemon to show up (17:09 - 17:14)
yeah I mean I was I oh they went to the (17:11 - 17:17)
mall like I literally texted you because (17:14 - 17:18)
I was gonna skip the whole thing I'm (17:17 - 17:20)
like yeah (17:18 - 17:20)
and then people were like oh there's a (17:21 - 17:26)
coin thing after and I hadn't looked too (17:23 - 17:28)
far into it be like oh you can't capture (17:26 - 17:30)
it so I could have just been at home (17:28 - 17:32)
but I was like oh well I'll I will still (17:30 - 17:35)
do my normal day I'll swing by for the (17:32 - 17:37)
last hour and a half I'll catch some to (17:35 - 17:40)
treaty which oddly I caught seven and (17:37 - 17:44)
I'm like why I wasn't even trying (17:40 - 17:46)
um and I'll see what it is and I think (17:44 - 17:48)
both will and I would oh that's what it (17:46 - 17:48)
is (17:48 - 17:50)
bye (17:48 - 17:52)
see ya (17:50 - 17:55)
got stuff to do Hallmark has movies they (17:52 - 17:57)
start at seven o'clock here in central (17:55 - 18:00)
time I needed to get my stuff done and (17:57 - 18:02)
get myself on that couch for myself (18:00 - 18:04)
virtual true dungeon to do last night at (18:02 - 18:07)
exactly 6 12 p.m and I had a pizza (18:04 - 18:10)
waiting for me at home virtual true (18:07 - 18:13)
dungeon I don't even have time to (18:10 - 18:15)
analyze the semantics of those three (18:13 - 18:18)
words together (18:15 - 18:20)
I will say it was cool being in Mall of (18:18 - 18:23)
America which has like 30 40 pokestops (18:20 - 18:26)
and watch them slowly like get infected (18:23 - 18:28)
and turn yellow because when you guys (18:26 - 18:30)
left there was only maybe like six or (18:28 - 18:31)
seven two or three (18:30 - 18:34)
um and then I I grabbed food as soon as (18:31 - 18:36)
it ended and then like half of them (18:34 - 18:38)
turned yellow at that point and then (18:36 - 18:39)
while I was leaving like everything in (18:38 - 18:42)
Mall of America was yellow at that point (18:39 - 18:45)
um so that was kind of cool I the drop (18:42 - 18:47)
rate for coins seemed relatively low (18:45 - 18:49)
though uh because I was spinning (18:47 - 18:52)
stops non-stop as I walked in a circle (18:49 - 18:55)
and I did I think two laps around Mall (18:52 - 18:58)
of America after Dratini ended and I (18:55 - 19:00)
only ended up with like 12 points (18:58 - 19:04)
so I I don't know what the the rate of (19:00 - 19:06)
them drop but also we don't know what (19:04 - 19:07)
the coins do besides take up your (19:06 - 19:10)
inventory uh (19:07 - 19:10)
so (19:10 - 19:14)
um (19:12 - 19:14)
yeah two Ghost Pokemon in a row they (19:14 - 19:19)
announced that dog and then they (19:17 - 19:21)
announced this one so I mean it's that (19:19 - 19:23)
time of year ghost true if you're gonna (19:21 - 19:25)
announce ghosts might as well now (19:23 - 19:29)
Halloween I suppose (19:25 - 19:29)
um (19:31 - 19:34)
yeah there's not a whole lot about this (19:32 - 19:37)
Pokemon although I mean it's weekend I (19:34 - 19:39)
don't know if anything more is gonna go (19:37 - 19:42)
out but I guess we could they don't do (19:39 - 19:43)
mine they put it on the page this is how (19:42 - 19:45)
we're getting yeah it's on the page they (19:43 - 19:47)
made two videos (19:45 - 19:50)
they'll talk about Pokemon go after the (19:47 - 19:51)
game launches but you have to do to get (19:50 - 19:53)
the roaming form and then we're done (19:51 - 19:56)
yeah they said 2023 is when the games (19:53 - 19:59)
will links yeah announcement comes they (19:56 - 20:03)
will explain what it all means uh it (19:59 - 20:05)
says in it just this is off Pokemon go (20:03 - 20:08)
live.com it says uh you can learn more (20:05 - 20:12)
about gimme ghoul on Pokemon's website (20:08 - 20:12)
um and then it says (20:12 - 20:16)
um (20:15 - 20:18)
wait for the next research report to (20:16 - 20:20)
find out about the mysterious coins then (20:18 - 20:23)
it goes on and says in 2023 Pokemon (20:20 - 20:25)
scarlet and violet will be linked with (20:23 - 20:26)
Pokemon go (20:25 - 20:28)
uh (20:26 - 20:30)
linking these games will allow you to (20:28 - 20:32)
catch gimme ghoul roaming form in (20:30 - 20:34)
Pokemon go (20:32 - 20:36)
so that doesn't really give us a (20:34 - 20:39)
answer on how to catch it in (20:36 - 20:41)
unless it's just you catching this game (20:39 - 20:43)
move it over like meltan (20:41 - 20:44)
[Music] (20:43 - 20:45)
um (20:44 - 20:47)
uh this feature is planned for 2023 stay (20:45 - 20:49)
tuned for more details (20:47 - 20:52)
and then it says Pokemon scarlet and (20:49 - 20:54)
violet this is in the fine print are (20:52 - 20:55)
scheduled to link with Pokemon home (20:54 - 20:58)
after they are released so uh I think we (20:55 - 21:00)
knew this and I think we talked about (20:58 - 21:03)
this but this is now officially stated I (21:00 - 21:05)
still get questions from this time to (21:03 - 21:07)
time if like Pokemon home will work on (21:05 - 21:08)
day one (21:07 - 21:09)
um (21:08 - 21:12)
it right here Pokemon scarlet and violet (21:09 - 21:13)
are scheduled to link with Pokemon go (21:12 - 21:16)
home after release please wait for (21:13 - 21:17)
further announcements It also says that (21:16 - 21:20)
Pokemon Go Cannot directly send Pokemon (21:17 - 21:22)
to scarlet and violet (21:20 - 21:23)
obviously you have to send them to home (21:22 - 21:25)
first (21:23 - 21:28)
um but we we knew that as well (21:25 - 21:29)
um (21:28 - 21:31)
I think the fastest a game has worked (21:29 - 21:33)
with Pokemon (21:31 - 21:35)
bank I should say was Scarlet or sorry (21:33 - 21:38)
it was Ultra Sun Ultra Moon which was I (21:35 - 21:41)
think about two weeks uh sun and moon (21:38 - 21:43)
was that whole joke of like 3 000 years (21:41 - 21:45)
where yeah they got delayed I don't (21:43 - 21:47)
remember how fast Omega Ruby Alpha (21:45 - 21:48)
Sapphire was was that like a month I (21:47 - 21:51)
think ah a month sounds about right and (21:48 - 21:54)
then bdsp was a nightmare forever a (21:51 - 21:56)
million years (21:54 - 22:00)
Scarlet uh sword and shield was (21:56 - 22:01)
well that was when we were officially (22:00 - 22:03)
waiting for home now we were waiting for (22:01 - 22:05)
home and then home wasn't home a (22:03 - 22:06)
surprise drop at the beginning of (22:05 - 22:08)
December if I remember correctly Eric (22:06 - 22:12)
homes here what (22:08 - 22:12)
uh was home in December I thought it was (22:12 - 22:19)
in like March yeah it was the surprise (22:14 - 22:21)
because we were all kind of scrambling (22:19 - 22:24)
like how well how did this happen (22:21 - 22:27)
uh okay so uh let's finish off some (22:24 - 22:29)
Pokemon go news here now that we've (22:27 - 22:33)
transitioned uh zarua and zorark (22:29 - 22:35)
revealed themselves in Pokemon go (22:33 - 22:37)
did we talk about that the show where (22:35 - 22:38)
they tried to do it during Spotlight (22:37 - 22:41)
hour and it was really cool (22:38 - 22:44)
um and then it broke yeah no we did not (22:41 - 22:48)
talk about okay so during was it Shuppet (22:44 - 22:49)
Spotlight hour I remember let's be doing (22:48 - 22:51)
Shepard's Spotlight it was like shopping (22:49 - 22:53)
or mystery this one of those not (22:51 - 22:55)
Unforgettable Pokemon so ideally what (22:53 - 22:56)
was supposed to happen is at the start (22:55 - 22:58)
of Spotlight hour for like five minutes (22:56 - 23:01)
your buddy Pokemon would appear (22:58 - 23:03)
everywhere in the wild and then when you (23:01 - 23:05)
try to catch your buddy Pokemon it would (23:03 - 23:07)
turn into zarua so it was supposed to (23:05 - 23:09)
appear at the five minutes of Spotlight (23:07 - 23:11)
and then at the end it was supposed to (23:09 - 23:14)
be October 25th okay it was the same day (23:11 - 23:18)
uh the dog was revealed and then at the (23:14 - 23:20)
end of Spotlight hour the same thing was (23:18 - 23:22)
supposed to happen so if you had like um (23:20 - 23:24)
like I have sigilith right now as my (23:22 - 23:25)
buddy so sigilith would appear in the (23:24 - 23:26)
wild which is like really weird to see (23:25 - 23:28)
because that's normally only like Egypt (23:26 - 23:31)
if you had like a shiny Dratini that (23:28 - 23:32)
would appear (23:31 - 23:33)
um (23:32 - 23:35)
and if you get something like shiny (23:33 - 23:38)
Kyogre you would see these huge Kyogre (23:35 - 23:40)
or shiny spawn in the wild but what was (23:38 - 23:43)
what happened what broke was when you (23:40 - 23:46)
caught the zarua because it would be (23:43 - 23:47)
Kyogre you would catch it would turn (23:46 - 23:51)
into zaru of the ditto thing uh it would (23:47 - 23:55)
keep the CP and this the IVs of the (23:51 - 23:58)
Pokemon that was already your buddy so (23:55 - 24:02)
if it was like a 3000 CP 1515 Kyogre all (23:58 - 24:05)
of a sudden you would have a 3000 CP (24:02 - 24:08)
1515 zarua which is a Rua CP can't even (24:05 - 24:10)
go that high (24:08 - 24:12)
um so they rolled that out obviously in (24:10 - 24:13)
everyone's favorite test region New (24:12 - 24:14)
Zealand (24:13 - 24:16)
um and then they realized that it was (24:14 - 24:19)
not working uh because of the the CP (24:16 - 24:20)
copying (24:19 - 24:23)
um so by the time it got to Australia (24:20 - 24:25)
which is your second test region uh they (24:23 - 24:27)
turned it off and then (24:25 - 24:30)
they maybe were going to fix it and then (24:27 - 24:31)
they were like we can't fix it and then (24:30 - 24:34)
it was disabled for the rest of the day (24:31 - 24:37)
and then when they brought it back uh (24:34 - 24:41)
which was about like a week later (24:37 - 24:44)
um what they changed was just you know (24:41 - 24:45)
your buddy Pokemon would appear in the (24:44 - 24:47)
wild not a bunch of them just like one (24:45 - 24:48)
or two and then when you catch it it (24:47 - 24:51)
would turn into zarua but (24:48 - 24:54)
they had to disable the Pokeball plus (24:51 - 24:57)
because the Pokeball plus would still (24:54 - 24:59)
copy what was happening in New Zealand (24:57 - 25:01)
like the Pokeball plus couldn't figure (24:59 - 25:02)
out (25:01 - 25:06)
zarua uh um (25:02 - 25:07)
so (25:06 - 25:11)
you have two instances of you have a (25:07 - 25:13)
really cool thing that Niantic came up (25:11 - 25:17)
with and unfortunately it broke but I (25:13 - 25:19)
will applaud them I think that was a (25:17 - 25:21)
great way to introduce sarua I think it (25:19 - 25:23)
was really clever I think it it was (25:21 - 25:25)
really I felt like everyone was (25:23 - 25:26)
genuinely excited when it started (25:25 - 25:28)
happening in New Zealand (25:26 - 25:30)
um and I I did see people like talk (25:28 - 25:31)
about oh I want to switch this to be my (25:30 - 25:32)
buddy because I want to see a bunch of (25:31 - 25:35)
those in the wild and that would be cool (25:32 - 25:37)
um and then you have the classic Niantic (25:35 - 25:40)
problem of it breaking uh which is like (25:37 - 25:42)
a bummer like you you know we've been (25:40 - 25:44)
doing the show for so long but deep down (25:42 - 25:47)
I think we want to see niantics succeed (25:44 - 25:49)
and we want to see them get like a win (25:47 - 25:51)
every now and then and it's like they're (25:49 - 25:55)
just taking L after L Azure like they (25:51 - 25:57)
just didn't get this to work uh and then (25:55 - 25:59)
they they fixed it a week later but then (25:57 - 26:01)
they took another L because they had to (25:59 - 26:05)
disable the Pokeball the the Pokeball go (26:01 - 26:07)
Plus or the Pokeball (26:05 - 26:11)
the Pokey what was the other one Pokemon (26:07 - 26:11)
Pokeball go (26:11 - 26:16)
and then the Pokemon go plus I think (26:14 - 26:18)
that's what it's called no it's the (26:16 - 26:20)
Pokeball plus and then the Pokemon go (26:18 - 26:23)
plus is that what it's called yes okay (26:20 - 26:27)
so the disable those two devices (26:23 - 26:29)
um there may or may not be other devices (26:27 - 26:32)
out there but we're only talking about (26:29 - 26:34)
official devices uh all those devices (26:32 - 26:36)
got disabled (26:34 - 26:39)
um and then that gave a a pretty big (26:36 - 26:41)
uproar of a a small group of people that (26:39 - 26:43)
use these devices and I will say it's a (26:41 - 26:45)
small group of people that use these (26:43 - 26:47)
devices because (26:45 - 26:52)
um they are for hardcore people (26:47 - 26:55)
um and we know that you know thistlef (26:52 - 26:58)
Road one of the most angry places to (26:55 - 27:01)
talk about the Pokeball plus not working (26:58 - 27:02)
um (27:01 - 27:05)
there they are the minority and like (27:02 - 27:07)
they are the minority of Pokemon go (27:05 - 27:09)
players yes they are the most hardcore (27:07 - 27:11)
yes they they want to know every single (27:09 - 27:13)
thing about how the game works no shade (27:11 - 27:15)
to them but they are in the minority (27:13 - 27:18)
they they are not the vocal majority of (27:15 - 27:21)
Pokemon go players uh but yeah they were (27:18 - 27:22)
really upset (27:21 - 27:27)
um that it wasn't working and uh (27:22 - 27:27)
zerua came and went I think it was what (27:27 - 27:32)
was up for a couple days and (27:30 - 27:35)
now the Pokeball go plus is working (27:32 - 27:38)
again and zuru is gone (27:35 - 27:41)
uh so yeah that's where we're left off (27:38 - 27:45)
uh I don't know (27:41 - 27:45)
don't know like (27:47 - 27:50)
the logistics of (27:51 - 27:57)
as somebody who owns multiple Pokeball (27:55 - 28:00)
pluses and Pokemon go pluses and I I use (27:57 - 28:02)
them pretty frequently (28:00 - 28:04)
uh (28:02 - 28:06)
I don't know how I would really feel if (28:04 - 28:08)
like there was a day where Niantic was (28:06 - 28:09)
like all of these devices are not (28:08 - 28:12)
working (28:09 - 28:12)
how I felt because Niantic it's amazing (28:13 - 28:18)
to me that they can do push (28:17 - 28:21)
notifications the instant that somebody (28:18 - 28:24)
sends me a gift in Pokemon go but they (28:21 - 28:26)
can't do a push notification of say an (28:24 - 28:28)
alert about something happening in the (28:26 - 28:30)
game so I went out for my daily walk (28:28 - 28:34)
when in which I use my Pokeball plus I I (28:30 - 28:37)
know why it wouldn't connect (28:34 - 28:39)
with my would not connect would not I (28:37 - 28:41)
had no idea why I thought there was (28:39 - 28:43)
something wrong with me how dare you (28:41 - 28:45)
Niantic make me feel like there was (28:43 - 28:48)
something wrong with me when you had the (28:45 - 28:51)
problem and then a day later I found out (28:48 - 28:52)
about it (28:51 - 28:55)
part of the problem (28:52 - 28:57)
um (28:55 - 28:59)
from my understanding okay so obviously (28:57 - 29:00)
when somebody sends you a gift that's (28:59 - 29:02)
all automated by the game right so (29:00 - 29:04)
that's why you get that notification for (29:02 - 29:06)
my understanding and from who I've (29:04 - 29:07)
talked to (29:06 - 29:10)
uh around the Pokemon world I'll say (29:07 - 29:12)
that is Niantic cannot send you a push (29:10 - 29:14)
notification without the Pokemon (29:12 - 29:16)
company's approval (29:14 - 29:19)
Japan not America (29:16 - 29:22)
so in disabling that feature for them to (29:19 - 29:26)
alert for them to send you anything (29:22 - 29:28)
uh that would be outside the norm of (29:26 - 29:29)
normal gameplay obviously like they're (29:28 - 29:31)
not sending you the feature themselves (29:29 - 29:32)
when a set for instance you a gift (29:31 - 29:33)
that's just like automated through the (29:32 - 29:35)
game (29:33 - 29:38)
um they have to have Japan approve any (29:35 - 29:40)
messages that they're sending out that (29:38 - 29:43)
is not a wise decision (29:40 - 29:47)
it is wild that (29:43 - 29:51)
they don't have an emergency (29:47 - 29:54)
process set in place (29:51 - 29:56)
what's what's even more wild if you (29:54 - 29:58)
think about that it's like (29:56 - 30:00)
why didn't Japan just approve a message (29:58 - 30:02)
then to get sent out even if it wasn't (30:00 - 30:04)
within the first like 12 hours I think (30:02 - 30:06)
like 12 hours is still better than the (30:04 - 30:08)
next day and it wasn't even the next day (30:06 - 30:10)
there was still not a message sent the (30:08 - 30:12)
next day you had to go to (30:10 - 30:16)
Twitter or the Reddit or the Tumblr (30:12 - 30:17)
tumblr's back by the way you have to (30:16 - 30:20)
yeah (30:17 - 30:23)
like they still never communicated in (30:20 - 30:26)
game that this feature was disabled (30:23 - 30:28)
and maybe they were like well maybe (30:26 - 30:30)
maybe on the back end they're like well (30:28 - 30:33)
only 0.5 of people actively use these (30:30 - 30:36)
devices so (30:33 - 30:36)
I mean that doesn't matter if if if (30:36 - 30:45)
anything is going to it we we the amount (30:41 - 30:48)
that my company had to said send emails (30:45 - 30:50)
and mail and hard mail we had to say (30:48 - 30:52)
because we were turning off a feature (30:50 - 30:56)
that literally we haven't been selling (30:52 - 31:01)
for the last 15 years and you would say (30:56 - 31:03)
to most people and they'd be like that (31:01 - 31:06)
is still a thing the amount of work we (31:03 - 31:08)
had to do to warn people (31:06 - 31:11)
that this was going away (31:08 - 31:13)
doesn't matter if you're going to stop (31:11 - 31:15)
something that a customer you know is (31:13 - 31:19)
actively using it is your requirement or (31:15 - 31:21)
at least good customer service to let (31:19 - 31:23)
them know (31:21 - 31:25)
yeah we're shutting off this feature (31:23 - 31:28)
this isn't going to work today so that (31:25 - 31:31)
they don't you know (31:28 - 31:34)
clog up your contacts (31:31 - 31:38)
floods Twitter with angry outrage you (31:34 - 31:40)
know getting ahead of it so that people (31:38 - 31:43)
don't freak out (31:40 - 31:43)
it's why I'm I'm like why why did the (31:43 - 31:51)
Pokemon company or anyone higher up not (31:48 - 31:54)
push this through (31:51 - 31:56)
and argue like we need to send an (31:54 - 32:00)
in-game notification that this and even (31:56 - 32:02)
even go one step further not only say (32:00 - 32:05)
hey it's it's broken right now but to (32:02 - 32:07)
say like don't worry it's gonna come (32:05 - 32:09)
back in three or four days we're fixing (32:07 - 32:13)
it like our estimated time frame is (32:09 - 32:14)
three days (32:13 - 32:17)
like it's like I correct me if I'm wrong (32:14 - 32:20)
but there was never an in-game (32:17 - 32:23)
notification not that I saw but then (32:20 - 32:26)
again people might say there was I don't (32:23 - 32:27)
know I don't I didn't see yeah there was (32:26 - 32:29)
there was one when they acknowledged (32:27 - 32:31)
that it was turned off and that was (32:29 - 32:33)
there was another woman it was turned (32:31 - 32:35)
back on (32:33 - 32:35)
one of those very like when you start up (32:36 - 32:40)
and it was like the little news that (32:38 - 32:41)
pops up (32:40 - 32:43)
I don't remember getting one that was (32:41 - 32:44)
turned on I mean I saw the Tweet right (32:43 - 32:47)
away (32:44 - 32:47)
um but again not not a not everyone uses (32:47 - 32:50)
Twitter (32:49 - 32:52)
so like that's not that's not super (32:50 - 32:55)
helpful (32:52 - 32:55)
but it did put a question in my mind of (32:55 - 33:01)
well what it what if one day they're (32:59 - 33:02)
just like hey these devices are no (33:01 - 33:05)
longer supported which is possible oh (33:02 - 33:08)
it's very possible it is it is a (33:05 - 33:09)
guarantee saying as they've shut off (33:08 - 33:12)
things like Bank (33:09 - 33:12)
um (33:14 - 33:16)
well it's also like the amount of (33:17 - 33:23)
things that just close or go away or (33:20 - 33:24)
give up on (33:23 - 33:26)
[Music] (33:24 - 33:29)
or no longer used anymore hatching an (33:26 - 33:31)
egg uh (33:29 - 33:31)
I think I've talked about this before (33:33 - 33:39)
but when I when I ran into John Henke in (33:34 - 33:40)
Germany (33:39 - 33:42)
and he was like talking with Niantic (33:40 - 33:44)
creators uh and I don't think there was (33:42 - 33:47)
any like non-disclosure or anything he (33:44 - 33:48)
was like pretty casual and there was a (33:47 - 33:50)
lot of questions where you would ask a (33:48 - 33:51)
question to John (33:50 - 33:53)
um and he would give you a very like (33:51 - 33:55)
business answer I think we talked about (33:53 - 33:56)
this before on the podcast (33:55 - 33:58)
um and a lot a lot of the questions (33:56 - 33:59)
would follow up of like oh can I tell (33:58 - 34:01)
our audience that and he was like yeah (33:59 - 34:03)
like like he was pretty like you know I (34:01 - 34:05)
want you guys to communicate because you (34:03 - 34:08)
know you're a vital asset to you know (34:05 - 34:09)
how our game works you know people look (34:08 - 34:11)
up to creators and stuff but I've (34:09 - 34:14)
somebody not me somebody asked about (34:11 - 34:17)
um like a new Pokeball go Plus (34:14 - 34:19)
and he pretty much was like oh I'm not a (34:17 - 34:21)
fan of Auto catchers (34:19 - 34:23)
which like some people might take that (34:21 - 34:24)
out of context of like Niantic hates (34:23 - 34:26)
Auto catchers like just because like (34:24 - 34:29)
John hey isn't uh pictures are hacking (34:26 - 34:31)
just because John Henke isn't a fan of (34:29 - 34:33)
Auto catchers doesn't mean other people (34:31 - 34:36)
on the Niantic team like believe in that (34:33 - 34:37)
right like (34:36 - 34:39)
like I I could not be a fan of something (34:37 - 34:42)
but that is like whatever right (34:39 - 34:42)
um (34:42 - 34:44)
uh but then somebody else asked about (34:42 - 34:47)
sleep because sleep had that (34:44 - 34:50)
Auto catcher supposed to put under your (34:47 - 34:52)
pillow kind of thing and his answer was (34:50 - 34:54)
like I don't really know about that (34:52 - 34:55)
that's all the Pokemon company that's (34:54 - 34:59)
Vapor rare it's all vaporware it's all (34:55 - 35:01)
crypto (34:59 - 35:01)
um but yeah there there could be a point (35:02 - 35:05)
I mean like here here's a really great (35:03 - 35:07)
feature right that happened in Pokemon (35:05 - 35:09)
go because we could bring up features (35:07 - 35:10)
that happened with cell phones or (35:09 - 35:12)
features that happened with apple or or (35:10 - 35:14)
Android that have just like disappeared (35:12 - 35:17)
whether or not look at how many things (35:14 - 35:20)
that users used in Google that just (35:17 - 35:22)
vanished because Google was like we're (35:20 - 35:25)
sick of this uh what a specific issue in (35:22 - 35:27)
or a specific situation in Pokemon go (35:25 - 35:30)
was they had an app that worked on the (35:27 - 35:33)
Apple watch and it would tell you what (35:30 - 35:35)
Pokemon were around you it would show (35:33 - 35:37)
you your eggs it was a whole thing and (35:35 - 35:39)
they discontinued that (35:37 - 35:42)
um and I think part of the reason was (35:39 - 35:43)
like not a lot like it didn't really (35:42 - 35:45)
work the way they wanted it to and not a (35:43 - 35:47)
lot of users used it but it could be the (35:45 - 35:49)
same thing with auto catchers one day (35:47 - 35:51)
I'm not saying they should I like my (35:49 - 35:53)
auto catcher a lot and I use it for (35:51 - 35:55)
certain playstyles (35:53 - 35:56)
um but there could be a day where (35:55 - 35:57)
they're like you know what no more Auto (35:56 - 35:59)
catchers and it was funny because I saw (35:57 - 36:00)
like a couple comments on the sofa Road (35:59 - 36:02)
of like well I spent fifty dollars for (36:00 - 36:04)
this five years ago so if they turn if (36:02 - 36:06)
this is staying off forever I should get (36:04 - 36:07)
my fifty dollars back and I was like (36:06 - 36:10)
what what (36:07 - 36:10)
have I got news for you about (36:14 - 36:20)
technology yeah (36:17 - 36:24)
I should get the 600 dollars back that I (36:20 - 36:29)
spent on an original iPod in the year (36:24 - 36:32)
2000 something because it's it's (36:29 - 36:34)
connection devices are no longer (36:32 - 36:38)
supported firewire 800 is no longer (36:34 - 36:41)
supported by modern computers modern I (36:38 - 36:43)
missed the clickety-clack of this (36:41 - 36:46)
ancient wheel on this device which I (36:43 - 36:48)
still think is full of my Christmas (36:46 - 36:49)
music because that's the last thing I (36:48 - 36:52)
was able to plug it into was some (36:49 - 36:56)
December 15 000 years ago (36:52 - 36:56)
if they shut this off well you see ya (36:57 - 37:03)
well get get ready I can't wait for (37:01 - 37:06)
these people to reach like Willis in my (37:03 - 37:08)
age when half the things in her house (37:06 - 37:12)
don't connect it anymore (37:08 - 37:12)
that I have that I have dragged from (37:12 - 37:18)
house to house being like this this will (37:15 - 37:21)
literally never work again like like one (37:18 - 37:23)
of my favorite pieces of Technology was (37:21 - 37:25)
the Nike fit band (37:23 - 37:27)
and do you guys remember this it was (37:25 - 37:31)
like it was so it was so good it (37:27 - 37:33)
you know like fitbits and apple watches (37:31 - 37:35)
and all these devices to get you to like (37:33 - 37:37)
work out that was garbagey though the (37:35 - 37:39)
Nike fit band was so great it was like (37:37 - 37:42)
that translucent color and it like gave (37:39 - 37:44)
you like fireworks a little cross to (37:42 - 37:47)
like the LED screen oh it was incredible (37:44 - 37:50)
um I loved it so much and it was like (37:47 - 37:52)
you know how Apple's like oh fill your (37:50 - 37:54)
rings and I like never fill my rings (37:52 - 37:56)
ever but the Nike fit band had like you (37:54 - 37:58)
know hit your goal every I would always (37:56 - 38:00)
hit my goal I was also I was like (37:58 - 38:01)
working a nine to five job so I didn't (38:00 - 38:03)
set my office all day but I was (38:01 - 38:05)
committed to the Nike and I still have (38:03 - 38:07)
the Nike fit fan it doesn't work it will (38:05 - 38:09)
never work again it would never worked I (38:07 - 38:12)
paid 120 for it or however much it was (38:09 - 38:15)
when it came out and I can't bring (38:12 - 38:17)
myself to throw this away but what (38:15 - 38:19)
really Nike should do is refund me my (38:17 - 38:22)
120 they should they really you should (38:19 - 38:24)
write them a letter I have two drawers (38:22 - 38:26)
in my basement (38:24 - 38:28)
full of wires and connections and (38:26 - 38:31)
devices that I'm literally holding out (38:28 - 38:34)
to in case at some point I think I need (38:31 - 38:36)
to get something from that or I need to (38:34 - 38:39)
hook something up and I don't want to go (38:36 - 38:41)
through the hassle of finding like a (38:39 - 38:42)
Radio Shack in the middle of Wyoming (38:41 - 38:48)
that still has these hookups I am I have (38:42 - 38:53)
so many things that I'm just like (38:48 - 38:53)
well I might need it (38:53 - 38:56)

finding a new one (38:56 - 39:03)
I have these I I have VHS tapes (38:58 - 39:06)
and I don't have a player anywhere same (39:03 - 39:09)

what I have to buy a new record player (39:40 - 39:43)
and I had a perfectly good one from the (39:41 - 39:46)
1980s it's your followers aren't cheap (39:43 - 39:48)
either no they're not I mean you can get (39:46 - 39:50)
a cheap record player but if you want (39:48 - 39:52)
good news for those of us who never (39:50 - 39:54)
throw anything away I have two in my (39:52 - 39:57)
basement will I ever buy vinyl again no (39:54 - 39:59)
because it was garbage then it is (39:57 - 40:01)
garbage now (39:59 - 40:03)
they're there you know there might be (40:01 - 40:04)
like a GitHub (40:03 - 40:07)
out there that can make the Nike fit (40:04 - 40:09)
band work (40:07 - 40:09)
I bought a I bought a product called an (40:12 - 40:16)
atlas watch which was a workout watch (40:14 - 40:19)
and it would it would track your reps (40:16 - 40:21)
for you if you're doing like you say I'm (40:19 - 40:22)
doing squats so it would track thrips (40:21 - 40:25)
you didn't have to count when they got (40:22 - 40:27)
purchased they sent an email that (40:25 - 40:29)
everybody's saying we are no longer (40:27 - 40:31)
going to be able to support this we got (40:29 - 40:33)
purchased so find your original (40:31 - 40:36)
packaging send it back and we'll refund (40:33 - 40:38)
your money is the only company in my (40:36 - 40:41)
entire life that has ever done that and (40:38 - 40:45)
I sent it back and they sent me a check (40:41 - 40:48)
it was weird and I'm like I'm not (40:45 - 40:51)
questioning it I'm going to do it when I (40:48 - 40:53)
did the one company (40:51 - 40:55)
what's that Google's Google stadia kind (40:53 - 40:57)
of is doing that where if you bought (40:55 - 40:58)
your Google Stadium at a certain time (40:57 - 41:01)
you can pretty much you get a refund for (40:58 - 41:03)
I think the hardware (41:01 - 41:07)
Pebble Pebble got bought I think by yeah (41:03 - 41:11)
bit which then Fitbit by Google yeah but (41:07 - 41:13)
the the pebble also like that that was (41:11 - 41:16)
like a 200 purchase I think it was a (41:13 - 41:19)
Kickstarter it was like the one of the (41:16 - 41:21)
only kickstarters that like delivered (41:19 - 41:23)
exactly what they were saying like they (41:21 - 41:26)
didn't take any shortcuts like like yeah (41:23 - 41:27)
they didn't hit their deadline like they (41:26 - 41:30)
were late but like that was probably to (41:27 - 41:32)
this date the best Kickstarter I ever (41:30 - 41:34)
purchased because it was it was exactly (41:32 - 41:36)
what they promised uh it wasn't (41:34 - 41:38)
vaporware and I loved the pebble too (41:36 - 41:39)
that was obviously before the Apple (41:38 - 41:42)
watch and when they they were just like (41:39 - 41:44)
hey this is shutting down and it you're (41:42 - 41:47)
it's going to be a paperweight like but (41:44 - 41:48)
there were there were a dedicated fan (41:47 - 41:51)
base that like made third-party Pebble (41:48 - 41:53)
software to keep it running I remember (41:51 - 41:55)
you trying to sell me in a pebble for a (41:53 - 41:57)
lot and I'm like no because that sounds (41:55 - 41:59)
like obsolete where in five years and (41:57 - 42:01)
guess what I was right I think it lasted (41:59 - 42:03)
about four (42:01 - 42:05)
now you guys are making me realize I (42:03 - 42:07)
need to get the data off my palm (42:05 - 42:11)
tungsten W oh you absolutely yeah you (42:07 - 42:13)
gotta get retrievable I would I wonder (42:11 - 42:15)
if I can still sink it I was lucky (42:13 - 42:17)
enough to move my SIM card full of (42:15 - 42:19)
contacts off my Blackberry before that (42:17 - 42:21)
got shut down so I'm ahead of the curve (42:19 - 42:24)
there folks (42:21 - 42:26)
there there was a car (42:24 - 42:28)
um tracking software (42:26 - 42:31)
that was called automatic you put it in (42:28 - 42:33)
the little bottom of the I don't know (42:31 - 42:35)
what that Port is called (42:33 - 42:37)
um you put in that Port it had it had 3G (42:35 - 42:39)
built into it there was no monthly (42:37 - 42:41)
payment you paid a hundred dollars for (42:39 - 42:42)
the little device and then it would (42:41 - 42:44)
track uh it would track your miles which (42:42 - 42:46)
is great if you're reporting mileage for (42:44 - 42:48)
business stuff it would track how much (42:46 - 42:49)
gas you would use it would give you the (42:48 - 42:51)
standard error codes that like that (42:49 - 42:55)
little Port gives you in case whatever (42:51 - 42:56)
um I would do a couple other things it (42:55 - 42:57)
would I would show you where your car (42:56 - 43:00)
was parked this was this is like 10 (42:57 - 43:02)
years ago by the way so like this was (43:00 - 43:05)
like advanced technology and when they (43:02 - 43:08)
shut down at the start of covid and they (43:05 - 43:10)
were like oh covid really hurt our (43:08 - 43:11)
business which doesn't make any sense (43:10 - 43:13)
because their whole business was online (43:11 - 43:15)
so uh (43:13 - 43:19)
uh but like it was it was kind of weird (43:15 - 43:21)
seeing like you you've used this product (43:19 - 43:26)
for five six seven eight years and it (43:21 - 43:29)
just one day it's just hey we're done (43:26 - 43:33)
sorry I have news for you they were (43:29 - 43:35)
purchased because we sell those devices (43:33 - 43:37)
as features for my company and you can (43:35 - 43:39)
get that and plugged it in they got (43:37 - 43:41)
bought out (43:39 - 43:43)
secretly behind the scenes because we (43:41 - 43:45)
it's still a thing it is very there's a (43:43 - 43:47)
lot of difference yeah there's a lot of (43:45 - 43:50)
different those that exist but they were (43:47 - 43:52)
the only one that didn't well they had (43:50 - 43:54)
won the best app by far their app was (43:52 - 43:56)
like I've tried like three or four other (43:54 - 43:57)
ones and they some of the other ones (43:56 - 43:59)
have like monthly payments of like four (43:57 - 44:02)
bucks or eight bucks and it was like ah (43:59 - 44:05)
but your app's not even close to being (44:02 - 44:07)
as good and you want to charge me eight (44:05 - 44:09)
bucks a month like ah I'm just not (44:07 - 44:10)
interested (44:09 - 44:14)
um but they they did offer uh if you (44:10 - 44:16)
traded in your Hardware they gave you (44:14 - 44:18)
like 20 bucks because they would like (44:16 - 44:21)
recycle it yeah they recycle it (44:18 - 44:23)
um and then they shut down and disappear (44:21 - 44:25)
uh (44:23 - 44:26)
okay (44:25 - 44:29)
let's talk about betamax (44:26 - 44:29)
anyways I just thought it was really (44:30 - 44:35)
funny that the Pokeball go plus didn't (44:32 - 44:37)
work for five days and the amount of (44:35 - 44:39)
comments I read of people thinking that (44:37 - 44:41)
Niantic should refund their money was (44:39 - 44:43)
just mine (44:41 - 44:46)
you were just on a whole nother like (44:43 - 44:47)
does it suck that it shut down (44:46 - 44:51)
absolutely would it is it did it suck (44:47 - 44:52)
that Niantic didn't communicate it (44:51 - 44:55)
absolutely but for the entitlement to (44:52 - 44:57)
think that they should refund your the (44:55 - 44:58)
like (44:57 - 45:00)
I hope the Pokeball plus stuff doesn't (44:58 - 45:01)
go away (45:00 - 45:03)
um I want that Pokemon sleep thing to (45:01 - 45:07)
come out and have a new gotcha thingy (45:03 - 45:11)
um but that seems less likely than half (45:07 - 45:12)
the kickstarters that exist at this (45:11 - 45:14)
point well that's not true like earlier (45:12 - 45:16)
in the year there was Pokemon go updates (45:14 - 45:20)
that included sleep on the back end but (45:16 - 45:23)
uh anyways let's take a quick break uh (45:20 - 45:25)
we have a little bit more news to talk (45:23 - 45:29)
about and then uh we will be right back (45:25 - 45:34)

know (48:35 - 48:39)
they're just really milking this set I (48:36 - 48:40)
guess (48:39 - 48:42)
I wonder if this is like (48:40 - 48:44)
hey instead of putting out cards every (48:42 - 48:47)
three months what if we just drip feed (48:44 - 48:50)
our products every month (48:47 - 48:50)
you got people who's going to buy them (48:51 - 48:55)
like you (48:53 - 48:58)
yeah I mean the if if there's anything (48:55 - 49:01)
we can say about the Pokemon TCG is (48:58 - 49:04)
their art has continued to get better (49:01 - 49:07)
and better and better every set (49:04 - 49:10)
uh I hope those artists are getting paid (49:07 - 49:12)
well because they are just blowing it (49:10 - 49:14)
out of the water every every new set is (49:12 - 49:15)
just like wow this all right how can (49:14 - 49:16)
this art get better and they're like (49:15 - 49:19)
wait till next month (49:16 - 49:19)
um (49:20 - 49:24)
sneakernews.com (49:22 - 49:27)
only the the (49:24 - 49:27)
I'm sure sneakernews.com is the the the (49:29 - 49:38)
premium news Outlet here uh Puma takes (49:33 - 49:40)
on the Kanto region with a collaboration (49:38 - 49:44)
Pokemon collection (49:40 - 49:44)
um (49:44 - 49:46)
they say from from Converse and now to (49:47 - 49:53)
Puma trainers can gear themselves up (49:50 - 49:56)
with uh a couple shoes five different (49:53 - 49:59)
sneakers uh four Pokemon so there are (49:56 - 50:01)
there are two two of the five are (49:59 - 50:04)
Pikachu a one is an RSX and the other is (50:01 - 50:08)
a rider FV I'm sure if you're a puma fan (50:04 - 50:10)
you know exactly or if you're a shoe fan (50:08 - 50:11)
you know exactly what models of shoes (50:10 - 50:13)
those are (50:11 - 50:15)
um and then there will be a Bulbasaur (50:13 - 50:18)
Charmander Squirtle and those will be (50:15 - 50:20)
um those are three different shoes by (50:18 - 50:22)
the way uh the Char the Bulbasaur is the (50:20 - 50:26)
rider FV which is the same as the the (50:22 - 50:30)
Pikachu uh the Charmander is the (50:26 - 50:32)
slipstream low (50:30 - 50:37)
and the Squirtle is suede so uh (50:32 - 50:39)
ironically uh you can't wear the (50:37 - 50:41)
Squirtle in water because uh Suede and (50:39 - 50:44)
water do not mix if you treat it and (50:41 - 50:46)
protect it you can do whatever I mean (50:44 - 50:48)
you can (50:46 - 50:50)
once (50:48 - 50:53)
[Laughter] (50:50 - 50:56)
um uh these shoes are supposed to drop (50:53 - 50:58)
on November 12th (50:56 - 51:01)
they do come in adults they come in Gs (50:58 - 51:07)
PS PS preschool I don't and infant sizes (51:01 - 51:09)
I don't know what GS and PSR but (51:07 - 51:12)
uh (51:09 - 51:16)

no uh high end yes Pokemon end no (51:17 - 51:24)
oh okay so GS is grade school oh yes (51:26 - 51:32)
it's preschool I was right (51:30 - 51:38)
uh TD is toddler infant (51:32 - 51:39)
um (51:38 - 51:41)
I guess (51:39 - 51:45)
uh I don't have a kid so (51:41 - 51:48)
are you a puma fan Steve are you a puma (51:45 - 51:50)
head a planet (51:48 - 51:54)
uh when we were um shoe shopping Greg uh (51:50 - 51:57)
we did try on Pumas but uh I think all (51:54 - 51:59)
of them have pretty high arch support (51:57 - 52:00)
yeah you didn't like any of them yeah (51:59 - 52:02)
but again (52:00 - 52:04)
it's not the shoes it's your feet and (52:02 - 52:06)
you really need to go to a specialist to (52:04 - 52:07)
be like chop these off and get these (52:06 - 52:09)
replaced these are yeah these are the (52:07 - 52:11)
worst feet I've ever seen I have the (52:09 - 52:12)
custom insoles they're supposed to come (52:11 - 52:15)
in like two weeks you I I'm never gonna (52:12 - 52:16)
touch on the fact that you got scammed (52:15 - 52:19)
into giving away your footprint to the (52:16 - 52:21)
government for free it wasn't for free I (52:19 - 52:24)
paid 180 dollars (52:21 - 52:24)
108 Footprints so that when you commit a (52:26 - 52:30)
crime or somebody who wears your shame (52:27 - 52:32)
same feet size commits a crime they can (52:30 - 52:35)
pin it on you good job I stepped they (52:32 - 52:37)
sent me foam I stepped in the foam I (52:35 - 52:39)
sent it back yeah and now that's on a (52:37 - 52:42)
National Database of feet print and then (52:39 - 52:44)
you're gonna be like walking down the (52:42 - 52:46)
street and you'll be pulled over because (52:44 - 52:48)
somebody in Georgia has the same foot (52:46 - 52:50)
and committed a crime for everyone (52:48 - 52:52)
asking I did I did get the Pokemon Crocs (52:50 - 52:55)
they they do it they do it nobody was (52:52 - 52:57)
asking uh oh I saw him wearing them (52:55 - 53:00)
yesterday they were awful oh the the (52:57 - 53:03)
thing though the the Crocs are ugly like (53:00 - 53:06)
no one no one's we're not getting around (53:03 - 53:08)
that fact but (53:06 - 53:10)
I cannot find a better shoe at this (53:08 - 53:12)
point my feet do not I walked all four (53:10 - 53:14)
hours of community because I stayed (53:12 - 53:17)
after to do the the ghost thing uh press (53:14 - 53:21)
shoes for trash feet no I love Crocs I I (53:17 - 53:23)
will get another pair of Crocs someday (53:21 - 53:25)
you get the fuzzy cracks will with the (53:23 - 53:27)
fuzz on the inside keep your feet (53:25 - 53:29)
traditional plain traditional is fine (53:27 - 53:32)
with me uh but Mall of America had (53:29 - 53:34)
Pokemon Crocs for a long time it was (53:32 - 53:35)
weird because like people would be like (53:34 - 53:36)
hey did you see the Pokemon Crocs it was (53:35 - 53:40)
like yeah I got them like a month ago I (53:36 - 53:42)
I don't know why I took the news cycle (53:40 - 53:44)
so long to talk about it but Mall of (53:42 - 53:45)
America was on top of the uh Pokemon (53:44 - 53:48)
Croc they also have Pokemon gibbets (53:45 - 53:51)
official the gibbets are the little (53:48 - 53:53)
things that go inside the the top of the (53:51 - 53:56)
Croc uh but you can only get the gibbets (53:53 - 53:59)
online I could not find a a store where (53:56 - 54:01)
you could walk and get the one of them (53:59 - 54:03)
lights up too if you want your shoes to (54:01 - 54:04)
light up when you're walking you know (54:03 - 54:06)
what you want your Crocs to light up (54:04 - 54:08)
when you're walking they got a Pikachu (54:06 - 54:09)
that lights up I need that for when I (54:08 - 54:13)
ride my bike at night yeah see (54:09 - 54:15)
they're like not only will they see you (54:13 - 54:17)
riding they'll be like look at that cool (54:15 - 54:23)
Croc wear is that the Pokemon edition (54:17 - 54:23)
uh what a time to be alive segment just (54:26 - 54:31)
not gonna survive it (54:30 - 54:34)
Rick's just a class snob you bet (54:31 - 54:36)
somebody has to be (54:34 - 54:38)
uh we forgot to talk about this in the (54:36 - 54:40)
Pokemon go Section campfire (54:38 - 54:43)
niantic's social app is available in (54:40 - 54:45)
more U.S cities just in time for (54:43 - 54:47)
Halloween (54:45 - 54:49)
uh that's that's the news here I'm not (54:47 - 54:51)
gonna get that app it's got a 2.3 rating (54:49 - 54:53)
on it I invited five people (54:51 - 54:57)
[Laughter] (54:53 - 54:59)
there is uh campfire is niantic's new (54:57 - 55:01)
social app to help you connect with (54:59 - 55:04)
trainers and find raid battles near you (55:01 - 55:06)
instantly campfire makes it easier than (55:04 - 55:08)
ever to find local and remote Ray (55:06 - 55:11)
battles simply tap the map icon to open (55:08 - 55:13)
the campfire to view all the raids and (55:11 - 55:16)
flares around you (55:13 - 55:16)
um this was supposed to come out uh (55:16 - 55:22)
before Germany go Fest and the official (55:20 - 55:24)
thing that Niantic told me was they were (55:22 - 55:27)
delaying it until after Germany go fast (55:24 - 55:29)
because they didn't want to confuse the (55:27 - 55:30)
people in Germany (55:29 - 55:33)
thinking they needed to use this app to (55:30 - 55:37)
do their go Fest experience and or to (55:33 - 55:38)
confuse people who aren't going to go (55:37 - 55:41)
Fest in Germany that like there were (55:38 - 55:43)
raids inside the park that they couldn't (55:41 - 55:47)
get to because the park itself was gated (55:43 - 55:49)
so in that decision (55:47 - 55:52)
from start to finish very logical I (55:49 - 55:54)
agree with Niantic made sense delayed a (55:52 - 55:56)
couple days go fast is what through go (55:54 - 55:58)
Fest Germany was what like three days (55:56 - 56:00)
Friday Saturday Sunday (55:58 - 56:03)
and then I met and had dinner with the (56:00 - 56:05)
guy that got one of the guys that worked (56:03 - 56:07)
on campfire (56:05 - 56:08)
um (56:07 - 56:11)
and he was like hey just a heads up (56:08 - 56:13)
we're launching this later this week if (56:11 - 56:15)
you want uh feel free to like give (56:13 - 56:17)
people a tour on your stream show them (56:15 - 56:19)
how it works like because they didn't (56:17 - 56:21)
want us to show off campfire earlier (56:19 - 56:22)
than that (56:21 - 56:24)
so when I was streaming like Friday (56:22 - 56:26)
Saturday they were like hey don't hit (56:24 - 56:28)
the campfire button if you're making (56:26 - 56:30)
YouTube videos or streaming because we (56:28 - 56:32)
don't want people to ask questions about (56:30 - 56:34)
it and then had dinner with them on (56:32 - 56:35)
Saturday they were like hey show it off (56:34 - 56:37)
on stream I showed it off on stream on (56:35 - 56:40)
Sunday multiple times like here's a full (56:37 - 56:42)
tour this is everything it does because (56:40 - 56:45)
I genuinely was excited for it uh it was (56:42 - 56:46)
really cool I gave a situation like hey (56:45 - 56:48)
if you get to a new city and you you get (56:46 - 56:50)
to your hotel you open up campfire you (56:48 - 56:52)
can see exactly where all the stops or (56:50 - 56:53)
all the raids are and what what (56:52 - 56:55)
direction you could even walk in or like (56:53 - 56:56)
I've never been here before but look if (56:55 - 56:58)
there's like 800 gyms over here let's (56:56 - 57:00)
just walk in that direction really great (56:58 - 57:04)
so I gave a complete Tour on Sunday my (57:00 - 57:06)
twitch chat was super excited I was (57:04 - 57:09)
super excited I was I was using it as I (57:06 - 57:12)
explored Berlin it was it was incredible (57:09 - 57:15)
to find raids and walk around and also (57:12 - 57:17)
just you know never been in Berlin (57:15 - 57:18)
before so it was really great to walk (57:17 - 57:21)
around and use this app and then Monday (57:18 - 57:22)
came (57:21 - 57:25)
no news of the app Tuesday came no news (57:22 - 57:27)
of the app Wednesday came no news of the (57:25 - 57:28)
app and then Niantic was like oh it's (57:27 - 57:29)
not ready (57:28 - 57:33)
and I was like I don't know what (57:29 - 57:34)
happened (57:33 - 57:37)
we literally had dinner (57:34 - 57:41)
of death to that app (57:37 - 57:43)
um (57:41 - 57:46)
and I kind of felt like (57:43 - 57:49)
there was so much excitement over the (57:46 - 57:52)
summer about campfire (57:49 - 57:54)
and I feel like that excitement is maybe (57:52 - 57:55)
I'm wrong I feel like that excitement is (57:54 - 57:57)
no longer there but hey we're heading (57:55 - 57:59)
into the cold month so if (57:57 - 58:02)
anywhere up north you're like (57:59 - 58:05)
I don't care because it's cold and I'm (58:02 - 58:07)
not going out there (58:05 - 58:07)
um but uh hopefully they I mean campfire (58:08 - 58:14)
was far from perfect uh when it when I (58:11 - 58:16)
was using it but it was still like (58:14 - 58:18)
very functional it I mean it still did (58:16 - 58:20)
the it didn't do a lot but you know you (58:18 - 58:21)
could message people on your friends (58:20 - 58:23)
list so that was really great for (58:21 - 58:27)
coordinating like lucky or not lucky um (58:23 - 58:30)
find like one more heart to coordinating (58:27 - 58:33)
a lucky egg to get the experience (58:30 - 58:35)
um it was really great for just like (58:33 - 58:37)
looking around (58:35 - 58:40)
was really great for (58:37 - 58:42)
pinging (58:40 - 58:44)
assuming that other people were using (58:42 - 58:48)
campfire uh but (58:44 - 58:51)
yeah I I hope this app does well uh it's (58:48 - 58:53)
it's rolling out to more people I (58:51 - 58:55)
believe if you have access you can (58:53 - 58:57)
invite five other people so (58:55 - 59:02)
um yeah uh it works I don't think it's (58:57 - 59:04)
the most amazing app but it does work (59:02 - 59:05)
for what they wanted to work for which (59:04 - 59:08)
is primarily finding raids and and (59:05 - 59:09)
messaging people on your friends list (59:08 - 59:13)
that that does work so that's out (59:09 - 59:17)
uh final bit of news here is uh (59:13 - 59:21)
uh there is a new holiday collection (59:17 - 59:23)
um they added more stuff since when we (59:21 - 59:26)
last talked about it they we I think (59:23 - 59:27)
last time we talked about the holiday (59:26 - 59:30)
stuff they added more trains and more (59:27 - 59:31)
buildings (59:30 - 59:33)
and I think a couple years ago we (59:31 - 59:35)
complained that they were resin and not (59:33 - 59:38)
ceramic they are still resin yep uh not (59:35 - 59:40)
bad (59:38 - 59:44)
uh there but they uh added a bunch of (59:40 - 59:47)
knit sweaters they have added a lot of (59:44 - 59:51)
knit sweaters they added uh some pins (59:47 - 59:54)
they added uh the glarion starters I (59:51 - 59:55)
think are now I'm just sorry the Paladin (59:54 - 59:58)
starters are now there (59:55 - 59:59)
um they're they're getting into the (59:58 - 60:02)
ornament gang uh game Sorry ornament (59:59 - 60:06)
game uh which their ornaments were 17 (60:02 - 60:09)
that's pretty average that's reasonable (60:06 - 60:12)
yeah that's pretty average for ornaments (60:09 - 60:14)
as a person who is in the ornament game (60:12 - 60:17)
as in I buy a lot of ornaments that's (60:14 - 60:19)
not that surprising although there's a (60:17 - 60:20)
lot of people are like oh the balls look (60:19 - 60:23)
so good I'm like (60:20 - 60:26)
if your tree is just all balls you got (60:23 - 60:28)
that weird minimalist tree that's only (60:26 - 60:32)
good in like pictures pictures and not (60:28 - 60:33)
in real life because in real life we're (60:32 - 60:35)
like there's a bunch of balls and I'm (60:33 - 60:37)
done show me Interest show me texture (60:35 - 60:41)
show me levels show me figurines make it (60:37 - 60:43)
interesting for my eye if it's just all (60:41 - 60:46)
balls oops All Balls nobody yeah your (60:43 - 60:49)
your tree has to tell a story yeah and (60:46 - 60:50)
if it's all balls it tells the story (60:49 - 60:54)
boring quite adult tale yes I do like (60:50 - 60:58)
the winter wonder ball ornaments uh (60:54 - 61:01)
which is that's a 12 pack for 45 that (60:58 - 61:03)
seems a lot but yeah it's pretty average (61:01 - 61:06)
and then there's the together (61:03 - 61:08)
for the holiday ornament which is an (61:06 - 61:11)
eight pack that's 40 and these are just (61:08 - 61:13)
bad (61:11 - 61:16)
uh first off (61:13 - 61:16)
there's no Eevee (61:17 - 61:20)
which is weird (61:18 - 61:22)
um not that I like Eevee I just think (61:20 - 61:23)
it's weird there's no Evie it's (61:22 - 61:25)
Bulbasaur Charmander Squirtle EV hater (61:23 - 61:26)
uh (61:25 - 61:29)
Jigglypuff Slowpoke ditto and now here (61:26 - 61:31)
here's the thing here's the thing I want (61:29 - 61:32)
to say this is why I want to talk about (61:31 - 61:34)
together for the holidays eight pack (61:32 - 61:35)
they did it was cute okay because (61:34 - 61:37)
everyone was like Steve of course (61:35 - 61:38)
there's going to be a lot of Gengar (61:37 - 61:41)
merch it's Halloween let me tell you (61:38 - 61:43)
who's on these ornaments let me let me (61:41 - 61:45)
recite one more time Bulbasaur (61:43 - 61:47)
Charmander Squirtle Pikachu Jigglypuff (61:45 - 61:51)
Slowpoke ditto Gengar Gengar is not a (61:47 - 61:54)
Christmas Pokemon it always is (61:51 - 61:56)
gengar's on everything (61:54 - 61:59)
Gengar has more I swear at this point (61:56 - 62:01)
Gengar has more merchandise than (61:59 - 62:03)
Charizard (62:01 - 62:03)
also why is Evie not on this like Evie (62:03 - 62:07)
Evie should be in the place of Gengar (62:05 - 62:09)
realistically I mean I have a Gengar I (62:07 - 62:11)
have my original Gengar ornament from (62:09 - 62:13)
the time that I purchased them in Target (62:11 - 62:16)
when Pokemon just came out which they (62:13 - 62:18)
are rare characters items so anybody who (62:16 - 62:20)
is super nice to me towards the end of (62:18 - 62:23)
my life you may get those in my will (62:20 - 62:23)
how you feeling about the salad bowls (62:24 - 62:28)
they're I think they're really nice (62:26 - 62:30)
actually (62:28 - 62:34)
the the four pack of salad the serving (62:30 - 62:37)
bowls or the the salad bowls 39.99 they (62:34 - 62:39)
are ceramic by the way I do not (62:37 - 62:43)
microwave on twit Twitter twit not none (62:39 - 62:45)
of those Tick Tock how are you talking (62:43 - 62:47)
about oh they're salad plates and their (62:45 - 62:50)
salad bowls I see it's easy somebody got (62:47 - 62:51)
the stupid butter dish (62:50 - 62:55)
yeah oh yeah I got the butter I got the (62:51 - 62:58)
butter dish well does he that just he (62:55 - 63:00)
doesn't include us in any of the (62:58 - 63:01)
important happenings in his life at all (63:00 - 63:04)
anymore (63:01 - 63:06)
you should have texted us when you said (63:04 - 63:07)
look what I got I got the butter dish (63:06 - 63:09)
we've been like ooh ah let's let's come (63:07 - 63:10)
over and get butter from your butter (63:09 - 63:15)
dish instead we get the cold we get the (63:10 - 63:16)
cold (63:15 - 63:19)
information from Tick Tock like we don't (63:16 - 63:21)
even exist he may be smart enough to (63:19 - 63:24)
know that if I did get a request to come (63:21 - 63:26)
over to see the butter dish I would be (63:24 - 63:29)
coming over with my hammer to smash the (63:26 - 63:32)
butter dish now the Espeon together for (63:29 - 63:36)
the holidays ornament is really good (63:32 - 63:36)
um yeah you know I've always I've wanted (63:36 - 63:42)
to get into the ornament game (63:39 - 63:44)
but I feel like the barrier to entry's (63:42 - 63:47)
so high what do you mean because they're (63:44 - 63:48)
like they're almost twenty dollars an (63:47 - 63:51)
ornament you get five ornaments it's a (63:48 - 63:52)
hundred dollars five ornaments ain't (63:51 - 63:54)
gonna cover your tree but it's for the (63:52 - 63:57)
rest of your life yes you you build over (63:54 - 63:59)
you build up your you don't start year (63:57 - 64:02)
one with complete tree use year one (63:59 - 64:04)
you've got five ornaments on your tree (64:02 - 64:08)
year two ten year three Fifteen by the (64:04 - 64:11)
time you're 50 years old beautiful tail (64:08 - 64:14)
and you start buying your ornaments (64:11 - 64:17)
after Christmas when they're all 50 to (64:14 - 64:20)
60 off (64:17 - 64:20)
or you go to Target Black Friday or that (64:22 - 64:27)
weekend when they have put them on sale (64:25 - 64:29)
to get people through the door they have (64:27 - 64:30)
a ton of Pokemon stuff there you buy (64:29 - 64:33)
those ornaments and then you slowly get (64:30 - 64:35)
ornaments and then you have more (64:33 - 64:36)
ornaments they know what to do with (64:35 - 64:37)
which is my problem I have a ton of (64:36 - 64:39)
ornaments and not all of them get on the (64:37 - 64:41)
tree (64:39 - 64:43)
to relate to the ornament stuff they (64:41 - 64:45)
also put the cherish ball on the Pokemon (64:43 - 64:49)
Center the final uh 900 Pokeball so far (64:45 - 64:50)
who knows that they'll announce more but (64:49 - 64:52)
this is the LA this is the final one (64:50 - 64:54)
they have officially announced but what (64:52 - 64:56)
I want to say is (64:54 - 65:01)
a couple things number one is that uh I (64:56 - 65:03)
posted the cherish ball opening on Tick (65:01 - 65:04)
Tock and I posted on Instagram like I (65:03 - 65:07)
always do the the Instagram comments (65:04 - 65:11)
everyone's excited a beautiful ball this (65:07 - 65:13)
looks great can't wait to get mine I (65:11 - 65:15)
have the premiere ball I love it nothing (65:13 - 65:16)
but positivity (65:15 - 65:19)
now we flip over to The Tick Tock waste (65:16 - 65:21)
of money why'd you spend a hundred (65:19 - 65:24)
dollars this could be made in China for (65:21 - 65:26)
five dollars yeah everything is it's (65:24 - 65:28)
capitalism uh like just a ton of (65:26 - 65:33)
negativity and what I think is like age (65:28 - 65:36)
but also I guess that doesn't well I (65:33 - 65:37)
guess the conversation's done I guess (65:36 - 65:39)
that kind of answers every age there are (65:37 - 65:43)
people on Instagram are older than the (65:39 - 65:45)
people who are on Tick Tock if you ask (65:43 - 65:48)
if you ask a 17 year old this cost me a (65:45 - 65:49)
hundred dollars (65:48 - 65:52)
they're gonna look at you like a hundred (65:49 - 65:54)
dollars is so much money I don't even (65:52 - 65:57)
know how you got that you ask anybody in (65:54 - 66:00)
their 30s who had a surprise 500 car (65:57 - 66:03)
bill you're like it's 100 like oh that (66:00 - 66:06)
seems fine yeah you ask anybody in their (66:03 - 66:08)
50s we're like that's chump change at (66:06 - 66:11)
this point I woke up my foot wasn't in (66:08 - 66:12)
the right position I haven't walked for (66:11 - 66:14)
50 days and they charged me four (66:12 - 66:16)
thousand dollars at the hospital for it (66:14 - 66:19)
so perspective yeah it's just it's like (66:16 - 66:21)
do do none of these people have (66:19 - 66:23)
ornaments like ornaments are 20 bucks (66:21 - 66:24)
they don't do anything like five (66:23 - 66:26)
ornaments is one cherish ball right yeah (66:24 - 66:28)
do none of these people buy like fun KO (66:26 - 66:32)
pops like no in my mind I have money I I (66:28 - 66:35)
have bought purchased I have purchased (66:32 - 66:38)
maybe one Funko Pop most of my Funko (66:35 - 66:39)
pops are gifts (66:38 - 66:42)
and but I also think (66:39 - 66:44)
that there is not a single person out (66:42 - 66:46)
there that has not been gifted a Funko (66:44 - 66:48)
Pop at once in their life because (66:46 - 66:50)
because there is a Funko I'll give you (66:48 - 66:51)
one for Christmas well there's like (66:50 - 66:53)
don't you dare or Illustrated in the (66:51 - 66:56)
trash now you're getting two we're not (66:53 - 66:58)
cluttering up my house with that garbage (66:56 - 67:00)
and for your big birthday coming up but (66:58 - 67:02)
okay I don't like funkos but the nice (67:00 - 67:04)
thing about funkos is they there is a (67:02 - 67:07)
Funko for a very obscure things that (67:04 - 67:09)
would be hard to shop for anyways but (67:07 - 67:12)
again you know I've always said I would (67:09 - 67:14)
rather have one of these 100 pokeballs (67:12 - 67:17)
than six fun codes because like six fun (67:14 - 67:18)
codes would probably be the same price (67:17 - 67:19)
uh because I think it's just better (67:18 - 67:22)
quality and I like the metal instead of (67:19 - 67:24)
like the cheap plastic that is Funko but (67:22 - 67:26)
look if you like to collect funkos (67:24 - 67:28)
that's cool too like whatever makes you (67:26 - 67:30)
happy if you want 30 fun clothes on your (67:28 - 67:33)
wall that's cool uh but I I just think (67:30 - 67:35)
like the like this doesn't do anything (67:33 - 67:37)
therefore it's a waste of money it's (67:35 - 67:39)
just like there's so many things in your (67:37 - 67:40)
house or in your life they're like do (67:39 - 67:42)
you have no paintings on your wall or no (67:40 - 67:45)
no artwork on your wall or like (67:42 - 67:48)
no uh I don't even know what they're (67:45 - 67:50)
called but the like table thing you put (67:48 - 67:51)
on the table it doesn't do anything it (67:50 - 67:53)
looks pretty uh (67:51 - 67:56)
it but yeah you're right centerpiece (67:53 - 67:59)
yeah like a centerpiece uh but like age (67:56 - 68:01)
is probably the the defining Factor yeah (67:59 - 68:02)
I mean they don't have to decorate like (68:01 - 68:04)
they have cheap posters that they got (68:02 - 68:05)
from a concert once and stuff they (68:04 - 68:09)
inherited I was gonna say magazine (68:05 - 68:12)
yeah it's definitely inherited from (68:09 - 68:16)
their parents like it is it is a (68:12 - 68:19)
it is as you get older you're like I (68:16 - 68:20)
want I'm stuck in this place for a long (68:19 - 68:23)
time I want to make it look like I want (68:20 - 68:25)
to be here at least so I'm not depressed (68:23 - 68:27)
every day also anybody who's Christmas (68:25 - 68:29)
shopping for me can get me the vanillite (68:27 - 68:32)
frost knit beanie it is super cute and I (68:29 - 68:34)
will wear it (68:32 - 68:37)
uh thank you and I have to say (68:34 - 68:40)
anyone and everyone involved in the (68:37 - 68:43)
Stuffle doll Pokemon holiday workshop (68:40 - 68:49)
plus needs to be fired and punished (68:43 - 68:54)
that is a horror it's cute in its own (68:49 - 68:57)
ugly it is not it looks like it came out (68:54 - 69:00)
of Five Nights at Freddy's well five (68:57 - 69:03)
nights at Pokemon Center it's uh it's (69:00 - 69:05)
it's really it's really bad (69:03 - 69:08)
like Beyond its eyes and the oddly (69:05 - 69:12)
stitched mouth thing why are the ears (69:08 - 69:15)
wrinkled like that (69:12 - 69:18)
it's a well-loved no no (69:15 - 69:22)
it's just an atrocity I mean it reminds (69:18 - 69:26)
me of Raggedy Ann and Andy right like (69:22 - 69:26)
the 70s (69:36 - 69:41)
I don't only Stuffle that much (69:39 - 69:43)
I literally thought it was a mimic you (69:41 - 69:45)
Stuffle doll until I clicked on it and (69:43 - 69:49)
saw that it was actually just Stuffle (69:45 - 69:49)
okay question of the week (69:50 - 69:54)
seriously I would have bought that (70:02 - 70:09)
oh boy just like me they want to hear (70:04 - 70:13)
the question of the wee Carpenters love (70:09 - 70:15)
it (70:13 - 70:16)
um (70:15 - 70:19)
I think we we got a lot of uh new (70:16 - 70:22)
listeners uh because of Roger being on (70:19 - 70:24)
obviously Roger does his own podcast has (70:22 - 70:25)
his own audience so if you came over (70:24 - 70:27)
there welcome (70:25 - 70:29)
um stick around (70:27 - 70:32)
this wasn't really a question but I (70:29 - 70:36)
think it turns into a question or (70:32 - 70:39)
but we'll make it one well there was a (70:36 - 70:40)
lot of comments in the last episode so (70:39 - 70:42)
it was kind of really hard to dig uh but (70:40 - 70:45)
I did I did like this one uh masu Rika (70:42 - 70:47)
maybe it's how you say it says I've (70:45 - 70:48)
noticed a lot of comments uh stating (70:47 - 70:51)
hatred comments on the the YouTube video (70:48 - 70:53)
I don't think we stated that (70:51 - 70:55)
um I've noticed a lot of commenting uh (70:53 - 70:57)
stating uh hatred for Nuzlocke and it's (70:55 - 70:58)
a waste of time I would like to point (70:57 - 71:00)
out that uh what people perceive as a (70:58 - 71:01)
waste of time it differs from the (71:00 - 71:03)
majority between people (71:01 - 71:08)
um yeah I I think uh I think I I mostly (71:03 - 71:09)
just wanted like a discussion around (71:08 - 71:11)
this I don't oh well first are you gonna (71:09 - 71:14)
address the controversy of coders coming (71:11 - 71:16)
for Roger's head saying that it's just (71:14 - 71:18)
an easy thing to code a Nuzlocke in (71:16 - 71:21)
there the amount of people who do coding (71:18 - 71:23)
are like (71:21 - 71:23)
uh yeah I think we need to address the (71:25 - 71:30)
controversy that uh Roger isn't a coder (71:27 - 71:33)
and if he's LED you to believe that uh (71:30 - 71:36)
uh at him on Twitter (71:33 - 71:39)
we have guests on uh unless unless I (71:36 - 71:41)
know the guest is going to come back (71:39 - 71:45)
multiple episodes in a row or or like we (71:41 - 71:46)
at least know like a second or third (71:45 - 71:48)
episode is scheduled (71:46 - 71:50)
like there are things I disagree with (71:48 - 71:52)
with what people say but like like when (71:50 - 71:54)
Roger was like oh my favorite game is (71:52 - 71:55)
heart gold soul silver I was like we (71:54 - 71:59)
can't we just cannot spend 30 minutes (71:55 - 72:02)
talking about the I mean we could but we (71:59 - 72:03)
already we already were running a really (72:02 - 72:05)
long show so when he was like oh yeah (72:03 - 72:06)
coding is really easy I was like we can (72:05 - 72:09)
we just they can't we can't we can't we (72:06 - 72:14)
can't unpack this bomb of lies that have (72:09 - 72:16)
been laid at our feet (72:14 - 72:19)
um yeah so so to go back to the YouTube (72:16 - 72:21)
comment I don't think (72:19 - 72:25)
we the the show said that we we dislike (72:21 - 72:27)
nuzlocke's or nuzlocks were a waste of (72:25 - 72:29)
time no I don't think they're a waste of (72:27 - 72:32)
time I can see why (72:29 - 72:35)
um other people would because it is very (72:32 - 72:36)
tedious (72:35 - 72:41)
um and uh they but but also the people (72:36 - 72:43)
who might say oh nuzlocks are super (72:41 - 72:45)
tedious and a waste of time then all of (72:43 - 72:46)
a sudden they're turning on and off (72:45 - 72:48)
their video game three thousand times to (72:46 - 72:50)
get a different colored starter Pokemon (72:48 - 72:52)
and then the Nuzlocke people would be (72:50 - 72:55)
like that's a waste of time so (72:52 - 72:58)
a hundred percent correct that the uh (72:55 - 73:00)
what people perceive as a waste of time (72:58 - 73:02)
differs between people 100 I'm I'm going (73:00 - 73:04)
to State this (73:02 - 73:07)
as my official stance (73:04 - 73:09)
if you're doing something that brings (73:07 - 73:12)
you Joy it's not a waste of time (73:09 - 73:15)
there are worst if you have ever had to (73:12 - 73:19)
sit in a four-hour line at the DMV (73:15 - 73:24)
trying to get tabs for your car that's a (73:19 - 73:27)
waste of time playing a nestlock in your (73:24 - 73:30)
spare time because you enjoy it doing it (73:27 - 73:32)
will knitting right now (73:30 - 73:34)
not a waste of time oh of course because (73:32 - 73:36)
I'm making a blanket that will keep (73:34 - 73:38)
somebody warm at some point I mean us (73:36 - 73:40)
doing this podcast not a waste of time (73:38 - 73:44)
although people can argue that it is (73:40 - 73:44)
by official stance is if you are (73:45 - 73:49)
enjoying it and having a good time it is (73:47 - 73:51)
not a waste of time stop feeling guilty (73:49 - 73:53)
about doing things that make you happy (73:51 - 73:56)
provided they are not actively hurting (73:53 - 73:59)
other people yeah I I there's a there's (73:56 - 74:02)
a new form of Nuzlocke I'm doing air (73:59 - 74:04)
quotes for the podcast people called (74:02 - 74:07)
Iron Man oh I've seen this which is (74:04 - 74:09)
which is (74:07 - 74:11)
um you could only use one Pokemon the (74:09 - 74:13)
entire run so but if you catch a new (74:11 - 74:15)
Pokemon you can replace it with your (74:13 - 74:17)
other Pokemon but everything is (74:15 - 74:19)
randomized Nintendo doesn't like that by (74:17 - 74:20)
the way (74:19 - 74:22)
um and even if I did play randomizers I (74:20 - 74:24)
don't because that's not why I come to (74:22 - 74:26)
Pokemon I come to Pokemon for the mostly (74:24 - 74:27)
the collection aspect that's why my (74:26 - 74:30)
Pokemon home is a hot mess but (74:27 - 74:33)
when I when I watch other people do iron (74:30 - 74:35)
mod and I see how many times they've (74:33 - 74:38)
restarted and it's like 1 (74:35 - 74:42)
265 times I think to myself I cannot (74:38 - 74:45)
imagine playing the start of heart gold (74:42 - 74:48)
soul silver on a randomizer (74:45 - 74:53)
1200 times I just I simply cannot the (74:48 - 74:55)
one I watched was (74:53 - 74:58)
fire red or leaf green and I'm like I (74:55 - 75:01)
cannot talk to Oak that much I can't I (74:58 - 75:07)
no no please no and oh and and you know (75:01 - 75:09)
I I watch a lot of it and you know they (75:07 - 75:12)
get their starter Pokemon and the Rival (75:09 - 75:14)
just has something that even even if (75:12 - 75:16)
it's not super effective they just have (75:14 - 75:18)
better moves or they just have an (75:16 - 75:20)
obvious and then they the the (75:18 - 75:23)
CPU wins instantly and it's there's no (75:20 - 75:25)
skill there right there was literally (75:23 - 75:27)
nothing you can do they they got a (75:25 - 75:28)
better Pokemon with better moves you got (75:27 - 75:29)
a bad Pokemon with bad moves you (75:28 - 75:31)
literally cannot win it doesn't matter (75:29 - 75:33)
how good of a player you are and to see (75:31 - 75:36)
that situation play out (75:33 - 75:39)
so many times I think to myself yeah (75:36 - 75:41)
that's always I could never do that but (75:39 - 75:43)
to those people that like Iron Man and (75:41 - 75:46)
they like yeah the excitement of getting (75:43 - 75:48)
finally getting a Pokemon with good (75:46 - 75:50)
moves or finally making it past the (75:48 - 75:52)
second gym after (75:50 - 75:57)
500 resets of like I get it I get why (75:52 - 76:01)
people want that Randomness slash (75:57 - 76:03)
artificial difficulty because like (76:01 - 76:06)
literally the game is Just rolling 8 (76:03 - 76:08)
million dice at once and hopefully (76:06 - 76:09)
they've Fallen your favor (76:08 - 76:11)
but yeah I look at that and I go that (76:09 - 76:13)
that is not for me (76:11 - 76:16)
um when I did a shiny badge quest uh in (76:13 - 76:17)
X and Y (76:16 - 76:18)
which for those that don't know it's (76:17 - 76:20)
pretty much like you catch a shiny you (76:18 - 76:22)
battle the gym you catch another shiny (76:20 - 76:24)
and then because you have two shinies (76:22 - 76:26)
you can out do the second gym and then (76:24 - 76:28)
you get another shiny and now you have (76:26 - 76:29)
three shiny so you can do the third gym (76:28 - 76:31)
just uh you know a fun way to like I'm (76:29 - 76:33)
just gonna shiny hunt between every gym (76:31 - 76:36)
um and it kind of forces you to like (76:33 - 76:39)
get use Pokemon that you might not use (76:36 - 76:41)
right like a Nuzlocke is like oh I've (76:39 - 76:42)
never used an Oddish but the Oddish was (76:41 - 76:44)
the first one I ran into you were like (76:42 - 76:46)
I've never used a manetric but like I (76:44 - 76:48)
got a shiny manetric so I guess this is (76:46 - 76:49)
what I'm using (76:48 - 76:52)
um so when I did my shiny badge quest in (76:49 - 76:55)
X and Y I said hey to my twitch chat I'm (76:52 - 76:57)
changing the rules a little bit I'm (76:55 - 76:59)
going to beat the first gym leader and (76:57 - 77:01)
then I'm gonna start shiny hunting and (76:59 - 77:02)
I'm gonna get two shinies before I get (77:01 - 77:04)
to the second gym because in X and Y you (77:02 - 77:09)
cannot horde hunt until you beat Vila I (77:04 - 77:10)
think that's her name (77:09 - 77:12)
um and I wanted to horde hunt because (77:10 - 77:13)
obviously that would be a little bit (77:12 - 77:15)
quicker uh instead of just running (77:13 - 77:17)
around one in four thousand and there (77:15 - 77:20)
was one person in my twitch chat I I (77:17 - 77:22)
don't remember their name they seem like (77:20 - 77:24)
a new viewer but they were so mad I (77:22 - 77:25)
wasn't following the rules they were (77:24 - 77:28)
like I can't believe you haven't reset (77:25 - 77:32)
first they were so mad and I I was (77:28 - 77:35)
laughing because I was like bro like no (77:32 - 77:36)
one's calling the cops on me like it's (77:35 - 77:39)
okay guess what (77:36 - 77:41)
uh will and I are starting a new (77:39 - 77:44)
Nuzlocke police uh Forest smells like (77:41 - 77:46)
Police Academy (77:44 - 77:48)
you can uh (77:46 - 77:50)
call our special hotline it is going to (77:48 - 77:53)
be a 1 800 hotline so you will have to (77:50 - 77:55)
pay for charges to get in touch with us (77:53 - 77:57)
or you can buy a subscription service (77:55 - 77:59)
for 9.99 a month in which we will (77:57 - 78:01)
monitor everybody's nuzlocks and then (77:59 - 78:03)
call them and come and arrest them and (78:01 - 78:05)
lock down their game should I get a (78:03 - 78:07)
badge next to my name for that you're (78:05 - 78:08)
not a part of this you're pregnant (78:07 - 78:10)
you've already admitted to your (78:08 - 78:13)
criminality we are as the as soon as (78:10 - 78:15)
somebody pays us 9.99 a month we're (78:13 - 78:16)
coming for you (78:15 - 78:18)
we're gonna lock down all of your (78:16 - 78:20)
switches (78:18 - 78:22)
um the other thing I wanted the other (78:20 - 78:23)
thing I wanted to say I put in the show (78:22 - 78:26)
notes here that I got an email about us (78:23 - 78:29)
ragging on people who PSA grade their (78:26 - 78:32)
cards uh and (78:29 - 78:35)
and uh they pretty much said they like (78:32 - 78:37)
they like to PSA grade their cards for (78:35 - 78:40)
preservation purposes and I've never had (78:37 - 78:41)
a problem with that I just want to be (78:40 - 78:44)
clear never had a problem with that I (78:41 - 78:45)
the problem I have with people PSA (78:44 - 78:48)
grading is people buying packs because (78:45 - 78:51)
they think they're going to get a PSA 10 (78:48 - 78:55)
card sending it to PSA hoping that PSA (78:51 - 78:57)
actually gives them a 10 and then sends (78:55 - 78:58)
it back (78:57 - 79:03)
the purpose to sell it for more money (78:58 - 79:07)
I have PSA grading is completely subject (79:03 - 79:10)
correct look and we had people argue on (79:07 - 79:12)
our youtube Greg that like we didn't (79:10 - 79:14)
know what we were talking about for PSA (79:12 - 79:17)
you can look up videos of people who get (79:14 - 79:20)
like a Charizard PSA gives them an eight (79:17 - 79:22)
they crack it open they send it back and (79:20 - 79:24)
they get a nine and they CR they get it (79:22 - 79:26)
they crack it open again and they send (79:24 - 79:28)
it back and they get like a seven and (79:26 - 79:30)
they crack it open these exist because (79:28 - 79:33)
it's just a human it's just a human and (79:30 - 79:37)
making and they have like they have like (79:33 - 79:39)
a machine they run it through but at the (79:37 - 79:41)
end of the day there's not like a PSA (79:39 - 79:45)
police that's like like arresting them (79:41 - 79:47)
if that person had a great day (79:45 - 79:49)
and they're just feeling really generous (79:47 - 79:50)
there ain't nothing stopping them from (79:49 - 79:53)
putting a 10 on that card (79:50 - 79:55)
and if that person if they're their (79:53 - 79:57)
boyfriend broke up with them that (79:55 - 80:00)
morning and they got to go into work you (79:57 - 80:01)
better believe they're probably giving (80:00 - 80:03)
everything a seven and not an eight (80:01 - 80:07)
because in a world where we know if (80:03 - 80:09)
you're holding a hot beverage or cold (80:07 - 80:11)
beverage when you're meeting a person (80:09 - 80:12)
for the first time it will forever (80:11 - 80:15)
change how you feel about them do not (80:12 - 80:17)
come at me that PSA creates are (80:15 - 80:20)
completely objective (80:17 - 80:24)
I mean come on (80:20 - 80:27)
but anyways to answer that email I (80:24 - 80:29)
myself have three cards that I would (80:27 - 80:33)
want graded for zero reason to ever sell (80:29 - 80:35)
I just want them in the hard plastic I (80:33 - 80:37)
will probably send them to Beckett (80:35 - 80:39)
because I like Beckett's uh labels (80:37 - 80:41)
better than PSA (80:39 - 80:44)
um one is like a Japanese Kramer ant but (80:41 - 80:46)
like I have zero desire to ever sell (80:44 - 80:48)
that card I don't think it's a 10 either (80:46 - 80:49)
I think realistically it's probably like (80:48 - 80:51)
an eight because I there are very few (80:49 - 80:53)
Pokemon cards are at 10. this is why I (80:51 - 80:55)
don't ever suggest people to buy a bunch (80:53 - 80:56)
of Pokemon cards hoping to get a 10 (80:55 - 80:58)
because have you opened a pack of (80:56 - 81:00)
Pokemon cards they're the most crooked (80:58 - 81:02)
misprinted things in the entire world (81:00 - 81:06)
if I could get if I could get a PSA 10 (81:02 - 81:08)
non-holographic Charmander that would (81:06 - 81:10)
that would be a miracle because boy (81:08 - 81:14)
those cards are so badly cut uh anyways (81:10 - 81:16)
yes if if sending your own cards to get (81:14 - 81:19)
preserved to PSA makes you happy no (81:16 - 81:21)
shade to you for by all means do that (81:19 - 81:23)
I'm just calling out the people who (81:21 - 81:26)
think they're making a quick Buck off (81:23 - 81:27)
Pokemon (81:26 - 81:30)
uh because that (81:27 - 81:33)
that that ain't happening as well (81:30 - 81:36)
it might happen again but the whole like (81:33 - 81:39)
covid boom of Pokemon is is is that ship (81:36 - 81:42)
is fading fading fast (81:39 - 81:44)
Pokemon of the week (81:42 - 81:47)
all right last week's Pokemon let me put (81:44 - 81:48)
it two weeks ago which I still don't (81:47 - 81:51)
remember yes it's uh oh you know exactly (81:48 - 81:53)
what it is when I when I read it again (81:51 - 81:56)
you'll know Greg this Pokemon with a (81:53 - 81:57)
strangely deep and feminine invoice (81:56 - 81:59)
based on an animal you used to be able (81:57 - 82:02)
to buy in a cup or plastic bag at the (81:59 - 82:04)
school Fair learns two moves named (82:02 - 82:06)
specifically for the physical feature on (82:04 - 82:08)
top of its head (82:06 - 82:08)
it's what are you typing what are you (82:10 - 82:14)
typing back there I know I typed in the (82:13 - 82:17)
Pokemon though I think it's gonna be (82:14 - 82:21)
where you say it it is seeking (82:17 - 82:21)
on top of its head it's Goldeen Goldeen (82:23 - 82:30)
oh I was close I was close (82:27 - 82:35)
golden yeah I forgot okay (82:30 - 82:35)
let us know if after the 80s you ever (82:35 - 82:41)
had Street events or School fairs or (82:38 - 82:44)
they gave away goldfish yeah you could (82:41 - 82:46)
you could buy goldfish or win them in (82:44 - 82:48)
concert yeah yeah did you have that (82:46 - 82:50)
because that was I think back are you (82:48 - 82:53)
asking me yeah it feels like it feels (82:50 - 82:54)
like it was a fever dream when it (82:53 - 82:56)
happened to us and it was really cool (82:54 - 82:58)
because you would always bring it home (82:56 - 83:00)
and your mom would be pissed because (82:58 - 83:02)
yeah she'd be like why do you have this (83:00 - 83:04)
what am I gonna do with this where are (83:02 - 83:06)
we gonna put it because we don't have (83:04 - 83:08)
you just don't have a fish bowl yes you (83:06 - 83:12)
never know when I was when I was 16 or (83:08 - 83:14)
maybe yeah 16 I because I would have (83:12 - 83:17)
been working up Panera Bread (83:14 - 83:18)
um and that would have been in (83:17 - 83:23)
Brookfield Wisconsin and there was a (83:18 - 83:25)
Church Fair or whatever (83:23 - 83:27)
and it was like right in between the (83:25 - 83:29)
church and the Panera there was like a (83:27 - 83:31)
whole fair and they had like four rides (83:29 - 83:33)
and they had a bunch of you know it was (83:31 - 83:37)
a very tiny fair but they had the (83:33 - 83:39)
Fishbowl thing where you throw the ping (83:37 - 83:41)
pong ball (83:39 - 83:44)
into the bowl and then if you got it you (83:41 - 83:46)
got that fish (83:44 - 83:48)
so I won that it was like two dollars or (83:46 - 83:51)
something for like five balls (83:48 - 83:54)
uh and then I I don't think the fish (83:51 - 83:56)
lasted like more than 48 hours no (83:54 - 83:59)
because no kid knew how to do fish right (83:56 - 84:01)
you dumped it into a tap water and the (83:59 - 84:03)
thing was like well (84:01 - 84:05)
I died now but yeah and you know the (84:03 - 84:06)
other thing that they don't tell you (84:05 - 84:09)
about goldfish is even though they're a (84:06 - 84:11)
freshwater fish they kill other (84:09 - 84:13)
freshwater fish because they secrete (84:11 - 84:16)
ammonia yeah (84:13 - 84:18)
I mean to be fair the one thing they do (84:16 - 84:21)
to it is goldfish aren't schooling fish (84:18 - 84:24)
so you don't need more than one but they (84:21 - 84:26)
appreciate having more than one because (84:24 - 84:29)
they are social fish (84:26 - 84:31)
I mean and goldfish there's temperatures (84:29 - 84:34)
like the whole thing is like there's a (84:31 - 84:36)
lot that goes into me just giving kids (84:34 - 84:40)
fish at a fair oh wait wait while you (84:36 - 84:42)
guys look up details about Goldeen one (84:40 - 84:45)
last goldfish story at the freshwater (84:42 - 84:48)
lake aquarium in Duluth Minnesota yeah (84:45 - 84:51)
which is very lovely they have these (84:48 - 84:54)
massive tanks where they have Lake fish (84:51 - 84:56)
and it's like by they're very tall so (84:54 - 84:58)
that you can see like fish at different (84:56 - 85:01)
depths and in one of those (84:58 - 85:05)
is a single very large goldfish because (85:01 - 85:07)
goldfish will get large yeah they get (85:05 - 85:09)
real bad and they have the space and the (85:07 - 85:12)
caption basically says we thought this (85:09 - 85:14)
was another fish when it came in it (85:12 - 85:16)
turned out to be a goldfish but it lives (85:14 - 85:18)
here now so we're not gonna get rid of (85:16 - 85:20)
it (85:18 - 85:20)
wait is the Duluth aquarium better than (85:21 - 85:27)
this Minneapolis have an aquarium no I (85:24 - 85:30)
mean 10 uh yeah Mall of America The Mall (85:27 - 85:32)
of America's heat but no the the Duluth (85:30 - 85:35)
aquarium is is a one of the only all (85:32 - 85:39)
fresh water aquariums that exists and (85:35 - 85:42)
it's it's an amazing thing to see it is (85:39 - 85:44)
really well done it's well kept (85:42 - 85:47)
um you know it was built recently which (85:44 - 85:50)
means post 2000 they did a lot of work (85:47 - 85:53)
into it you can see a lot of you see a (85:50 - 85:54)
lot of native Minnesotan fish that you (85:53 - 85:57)
just don't ever see you can pet a (85:54 - 85:59)
sturgeon you can bet a surgeon well you (85:57 - 86:01)
can bid a surge in a lot of places like (85:59 - 86:03)
the Minnesota Zoo has an aquarium right (86:01 - 86:06)
for all the Exotic like sharks and and (86:03 - 86:08)
salt water and all those things this the (86:06 - 86:11)
Duluth one is solely dedicated to (86:08 - 86:14)
freshwater fish which generally you (86:11 - 86:16)
don't find in most like they'll have (86:14 - 86:18)
some small ones but most people are like (86:16 - 86:21)
I want to see a shark I want to see an (86:18 - 86:22)
angel fish I want to see something weird (86:21 - 86:25)
and creepy and like this is just these (86:22 - 86:27)
are fish these are the fish that you run (86:25 - 86:29)
into those fish and they're they're (86:27 - 86:32)
they're gorgeous but and if you go to (86:29 - 86:34)
Minnesota and you're going to Duluth I (86:32 - 86:35)
strongly suggest going to the aquarium (86:34 - 86:38)
and it is a good experience got it you (86:35 - 86:40)
know for as many times as we've gone to (86:38 - 86:42)
Mall of America I have I I don't even (86:40 - 86:44)
know how big that aquarium is down there (86:42 - 86:47)
big I've done it a couple of times it's (86:44 - 86:50)
it's worth it once but it's packed full (86:47 - 86:51)
of kids and post covet I'm like no (86:50 - 86:52)
thanks (86:51 - 86:54)
oh you could probably go like (86:52 - 86:57)
Wednesday at like three or like two you (86:54 - 87:00)
would be amazed at what happens at the (86:57 - 87:02)
Mall of America on weekdays because I've (87:00 - 87:04)
been I live close enough that I've been (87:02 - 87:07)
it gets wild out there (87:04 - 87:09)
um in the Pokemon Red and Blue beta (87:07 - 87:11)
Goldeen was known as Goldie (87:09 - 87:13)
goldeen's number in the Sinnoh Pokedex (87:11 - 87:15)
and the Johto Pokedex is the same it is (87:13 - 87:18)
78. Goldeen and its Evolution were the (87:15 - 87:20)
only Pokemon that could learn waterfall (87:18 - 87:22)
in Generation 1 before it was moved to (87:20 - 87:24)
be an HM I actually didn't know that (87:22 - 87:25)
because I don't think I've ever used a (87:24 - 87:28)
Goldeen in a single player (87:25 - 87:32)
Goldeen shares the similar in-game cry (87:28 - 87:35)
to Caterpie it's uh cry is .07 seconds (87:32 - 87:38)
longer I'm still on the I will always be (87:35 - 87:40)
on the fence that all the cries should (87:38 - 87:42)
be redone I know they should be (87:40 - 87:46)
uh even though Goldeen uses a splash in (87:42 - 87:47)
all five Super Smash Brothers games as (87:46 - 87:50)
well as Pokemon quests it has no way of (87:47 - 87:52)
learning that move in any Pokemon game (87:50 - 87:55)
that's actually a good trivia huh uh (87:52 - 87:58)
goldeen's Pokemon Soul Silver pokedex (87:55 - 88:00)
entry claims that it can swim at five (87:58 - 88:03)
knots per hour uh this is technically (88:00 - 88:05)
incorrect as knots is already a measure (88:03 - 88:08)
of speed not distance (88:05 - 88:08)
um and then finally together with (88:09 - 88:14)
Magikarp Rattata Ninjask Pichu and C dot (88:10 - 88:15)
Goldeen is the easiest to catch in (88:14 - 88:18)
Will's favorite game Pokemon Ranger with (88:15 - 88:22)
