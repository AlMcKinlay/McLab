what's up everyone welcome to the (0:22 - 0:28)
582nd episode of the Pokemon podcast (0:25 - 0:30)
it's super effective I'm your host Steve (0:28 - 0:33)
with me is Hannah (0:30 - 0:36)
I'm excited for the DLC or at least as (0:33 - 0:40)
excited as I'm gonna get (0:36 - 0:40)
raving reviews right off the bat (0:42 - 0:46)
Greg is also here (0:47 - 0:52)
I'm not gonna recover from that one it's (0:50 - 0:56)
like the most honest (0:52 - 0:59)
dlc's coming I guess (0:56 - 1:01)
don't get me revved up hello everybody (0:59 - 1:04)
I'm back from DragonCon hello to (1:01 - 1:05)
everybody who saw me at DragonCon thank (1:04 - 1:08)
you for stopping by and saying hi (1:05 - 1:10)
and coming to my shows and stuff it was (1:08 - 1:12)
wonderful meeting you all and if I (1:10 - 1:14)
missed you or you had a thing I tried to (1:12 - 1:17)
get there it was chaos (1:14 - 1:19)
I learned a lot about what DragonCon is (1:17 - 1:23)
and boy it's it is an event (1:19 - 1:26)
that is wild is it uh something you want (1:23 - 1:28)
to go back to (1:26 - 1:29)
I mean (1:28 - 1:31)
yes ish (1:29 - 1:34)
I like our panel was standing room only (1:31 - 1:36)
which was absolutely great like our live (1:34 - 1:38)
show went really really well and that (1:36 - 1:39)
was wonderful and the stuff that I did (1:38 - 1:44)
attend was good but the lines okay so (1:39 - 1:46)
they had a vendor Hall that was four (1:44 - 1:47)
floors (1:46 - 1:49)
the line to get into the vendor Hall was (1:47 - 1:52)
three hours (1:49 - 1:54)
I went into the vendor Hall and I was (1:52 - 1:57)
literally telling people don't wait (1:54 - 1:59)
there's nothing here you can get it (1:57 - 2:02)
online for cheaper the only like the (1:59 - 2:04)
artist room was great but I didn't think (2:02 - 2:07)
that it was worth (2:04 - 2:10)
the four three to four hour wait to get (2:07 - 2:12)
in because it didn't separate the (2:10 - 2:15)
artist's room in the vendor Hall no (2:12 - 2:18)
they're in the same building yeah uh yes (2:15 - 2:21)
it went up and down and then around the (2:18 - 2:24)
building and then into a parking garage (2:21 - 2:26)
and around the parking garage and then (2:24 - 2:27)
in (2:26 - 2:30)
and people would just stand on our mic (2:27 - 2:33)
your boy I was like hey it's the (2:30 - 2:35)
opposite of pax it was very spacious and (2:33 - 2:38)
very spread out and there were also (2:35 - 2:41)
multiple floors but there was I mean (2:38 - 2:42)
there was lines obviously if you wanted (2:41 - 2:44)
to play a game early or something you (2:42 - 2:45)
had to wait in line but (2:44 - 2:48)
if you wanted to spend money they there (2:45 - 2:50)
was no line to spend money (2:48 - 2:54)
they would take it very quickly I mean (2:50 - 2:56)
like the Nintendo Place had a line to I (2:54 - 2:58)
was (2:56 - 3:02)
flabbergasted at the weight we got in (2:58 - 3:05)
line and we had waited (3:02 - 3:05)
probably 40 minutes to get to one point (3:05 - 3:10)
and then we were crossing the line and (3:08 - 3:12)
we looked at the other guy and he and (3:10 - 3:14)
he's like so I've been in this line for (3:12 - 3:16)
an hour and a half and we're like okay (3:14 - 3:18)
well we're out because we don't even (3:16 - 3:21)
think you're halfway so bye I don't care (3:18 - 3:25)
there's nothing in there that I want (3:21 - 3:28)
well speaking of waiting you won't have (3:25 - 3:31)
to wait much longer for new Pokemon in (3:28 - 3:34)
Pokemon sleep that was a pretty (3:31 - 3:36)
okay transition honestly uh who (3:34 - 3:37)
describes it (3:36 - 3:40)
this is uh this is our last podcast (3:37 - 3:42)
before the DLC uh what the DLC will (3:40 - 3:47)
bring we don't know uh really they you (3:42 - 3:50)
know the trailers I feel I feel like the (3:47 - 3:51)
Pokemon company is good at marketing (3:50 - 3:53)
their stuff as in their honest in what (3:51 - 3:55)
you're getting you go back and you look (3:53 - 3:57)
at like Legends Arceus marketing and (3:55 - 4:00)
you're like oh that was exactly the game (3:57 - 4:04)
yeah you had for ties (4:00 - 4:04)
a lot of people myself included want (4:04 - 4:08)
some (4:07 - 4:10)
surprise right I think we all want (4:08 - 4:11)
surprises like we all want to be (4:10 - 4:13)
surprised and delighted (4:11 - 4:14)
um (4:13 - 4:16)
even with some of the spoilers that uh (4:14 - 4:20)
Twitter now X just forcefully shows on (4:16 - 4:22)
you because you just log in and they're (4:20 - 4:24)
like here's the for you page and here is (4:22 - 4:26)
like the top post we're just gonna show (4:24 - 4:28)
you and you're like I didn't want to see (4:26 - 4:29)
that early (4:28 - 4:32)
um see I actively have been blocking (4:29 - 4:33)
people (4:32 - 4:37)
and muting certain terms also I don't go (4:33 - 4:41)
there very often so I have to actually (4:37 - 4:44)
not I know I know there are leaks and (4:41 - 4:46)
rumors because there always are and I'm (4:44 - 4:48)
not going to cover my stance on leaks (4:46 - 4:49)
and rumors (4:48 - 4:52)
um but I surprisingly haven't seen (4:49 - 4:54)
anything beyond (4:52 - 4:57)
the trailers and the page like I really (4:54 - 5:00)
have not seen (4:57 - 5:03)
anything (5:00 - 5:06)
I think the thing that I would want (5:03 - 5:10)
is like I I try to say this on on my (5:06 - 5:11)
twitch stream and everyone was like (5:10 - 5:13)
apricorn balls I was like no that's not (5:11 - 5:15)
the point I was trying to make like I (5:13 - 5:17)
liked that the grandma Matic was a (5:15 - 5:20)
surprise hmm and I liked that it was (5:17 - 5:22)
something to do with the items that you (5:20 - 5:24)
collected and people were trying to (5:22 - 5:26)
figure it out and fast forward to like (5:24 - 5:28)
there wasn't that many different item (5:26 - 5:30)
combinations but it was still like this (5:28 - 5:33)
huge like I want something like that not (5:30 - 5:35)
here let me be clear not something that (5:33 - 5:38)
makes apricorn balls just the concept of (5:35 - 5:41)
something that was like what is this (5:38 - 5:42)
contraption (5:41 - 5:44)
and it doesn't even have to be something (5:42 - 5:46)
that makes anything it's just that like (5:44 - 5:48)
walking into the room being like what is (5:46 - 5:50)
this and then everyone was obsessed with (5:48 - 5:52)
it I want something that everyone's like (5:50 - 5:54)
oh they didn't advertise this another (5:52 - 5:56)
thing would be like the Diglett there (5:54 - 5:59)
was what like 150 Diglett or something (5:56 - 6:01)
like that one 51. (5:59 - 6:04)
people were like oh like what happens at (6:01 - 6:06)
the very end I still think the reward (6:04 - 6:09)
was for the very end of that was bad it (6:06 - 6:11)
was bad it was so good it was fun the (6:09 - 6:13)
finding the Diglett was fun (6:11 - 6:15)
I just wish it was like a t-shirt or a (6:13 - 6:17)
crown or something that you could like (6:15 - 6:19)
go into a Max Raid Battle and be like oh (6:17 - 6:22)
you did the Diglett thing not like the (6:19 - 6:24)
six I think was it was it not a six IV (6:22 - 6:27)
Diglett that was the the final prize (6:24 - 6:29)
yeah that was um there was the the (6:27 - 6:31)
island that like (6:29 - 6:34)
kept giving you mints every day that was (6:31 - 6:35)
really cool there were like the rocks (6:34 - 6:37)
that gave you feathers every day there (6:35 - 6:39)
was the big Wailord that everyone saw (6:37 - 6:41)
right like these are I'm just listing a (6:39 - 6:42)
bunch of things that like they didn't (6:41 - 6:45)
advertise that everyone did seem to (6:42 - 6:47)
freak out about so I hope like if the (6:45 - 6:49)
DLC is as good as the Isle of armor (6:47 - 6:51)
slash cron thunderous I don't know if (6:49 - 6:52)
some people like one over the other plus (6:51 - 6:55)
there's what I just described like these (6:52 - 6:57)
little things I think it'll be really (6:55 - 6:58)
good (6:57 - 7:00)
um I'm like I'm excited to catch 100 (6:58 - 7:03)
Pokemon again I could move them over (7:00 - 7:04)
from (7:03 - 7:08)
bank or home but I'm I like catching (7:04 - 7:13)
Pokemon like I I like the oh my gosh (7:08 - 7:13)
[Laughter] (7:14 - 7:20)
anyways back to Pokemon sleep because we (7:17 - 7:22)
still have a section on DLC later we (7:20 - 7:25)
just got a whole yeah we sorry we took a (7:22 - 7:28)
side Tour all right let's do our down (7:25 - 7:31)
DLC Lane we should be on sleep Island (7:28 - 7:35)
let's get sleepy together okay so uh (7:31 - 7:38)
they're bringing two new Pokemon (7:35 - 7:40)
to Pokemon sleep for whatever reason (7:38 - 7:42)
they're doing that uh they're bringing (7:40 - 7:43)
Mr mime and mime Junior and they're (7:42 - 7:48)
coming to the cyan Beach yep uh I feel (7:43 - 7:50)
like I'm saying that word funny (7:48 - 7:51)
um (7:50 - 7:53)
that's the second area of Pokemon sleep (7:51 - 7:56)
so as long as you probably played for a (7:53 - 7:57)
week or two you've probably unlocked (7:56 - 7:59)
this it's not terribly hard to unlock (7:57 - 8:01)
the second area (7:59 - 8:03)
um (8:01 - 8:04)
but that (8:03 - 8:07)
you know they said they had a lot of (8:04 - 8:09)
Pokemon and more were coming I don't (8:07 - 8:12)
know if I like the the drip feed of this (8:09 - 8:15)
but maybe it's just like a one-off thing (8:12 - 8:16)
they also wouldn't have been my first (8:15 - 8:19)
choice no (8:16 - 8:21)
but I think that having more psychic (8:19 - 8:23)
type Pokemon is is a good thing (8:21 - 8:26)
since types do affect some of the things (8:23 - 8:30)
like berries that you get (8:26 - 8:32)
yeah I I mean (8:30 - 8:34)
I guess it means everyone's playing on (8:32 - 8:35)
the beach this week (8:34 - 8:39)
[Laughter] (8:35 - 8:41)
did they uh did they say if this was (8:39 - 8:43)
like permanent or if this was like one (8:41 - 8:46)
week only there's uh to be quite Frank (8:43 - 8:49)
not a lot of websites are reporting on (8:46 - 8:52)
Pokemon sleep (8:49 - 8:52)
sounds (8:54 - 8:56)
permanent yeah my guess is that it would (8:56 - 9:00)
be (9:00 - 9:03)
I guess that's just what I assumed but I (9:00 - 9:05)
hadn't actually yeah it doesn't I don't (9:03 - 9:07)
know that I don't know that nothing (9:05 - 9:09)
nothing they've put out said that it was (9:07 - 9:12)
limited time yeah and I tend to think (9:09 - 9:15)
the Pokemon company says (9:12 - 9:17)
if it's for (9:15 - 9:21)
x amount of time so I I Feel Like These (9:17 - 9:23)
are permanent editions unlike I think (9:21 - 9:25)
the upcoming (9:23 - 9:27)
Halloween event probably will be (9:25 - 9:30)
temporary because they're saying it's a (9:27 - 9:31)
Halloween event just around the (9:30 - 9:33)
Halloween time (9:31 - 9:34)
um (9:33 - 9:36)
and like everything that I've seen from (9:34 - 9:37)
the sleep (9:36 - 9:40)
pressure Lee says they will debut (9:37 - 9:43)
September 12th and there's no end date (9:40 - 9:46)
given (9:43 - 9:49)
I'm seeing the 11th in the evening but (9:46 - 9:52)
other than that yes Monday evening (9:49 - 9:54)
um nothing is saying that these will (9:52 - 9:56)
stop appearing so this is an interesting (9:54 - 9:59)
way to introduce new Pokemon (9:56 - 9:59)
yeah I uh (9:59 - 10:04)
I've done a lot of my sleep without (10:01 - 10:07)
going to (10:04 - 10:09)
be resources I know that without going (10:07 - 10:12)
to bed I've been uh doing sleep with my (10:09 - 10:14)
eyes open uh I've done a lot of sleep (10:12 - 10:17)
without like diving super deep into like (10:14 - 10:20)
the Min maxing optimal these are the (10:17 - 10:23)
best Pokemon get all your EVS don't ever (10:20 - 10:25)
evolve them kind of thing (10:23 - 10:27)
um but I did go to the Pokemon sleep (10:25 - 10:31)
subreddit recently and uh the thing I I (10:27 - 10:35)
do see is none of them like serebi's (10:31 - 10:37)
reporting on this uh they they think (10:35 - 10:41)
that serebii's wrong constantly and they (10:37 - 10:42)
have their own Google Docs they have (10:41 - 10:44)
their own like resources that are (10:42 - 10:46)
constantly getting updated (10:44 - 10:48)
I don't know if this is a thing where Mr (10:46 - 10:52)
Joe Serebii uh is done with like sleep (10:48 - 10:54)
and has moved on (10:52 - 10:57)
um just like the uh (10:54 - 11:00)
dexnav and Omega Ruby Alpha Sapphire (10:57 - 11:01)
there were resources that were much more (11:00 - 11:03)
accurate than Serebii was I don't know (11:01 - 11:05)
if Joe was ever gonna go back to dextab (11:03 - 11:07)
to try to figure that out so I don't (11:05 - 11:09)
know if it's one of those cases but (11:07 - 11:11)
um (11:09 - 11:13)
uh the the Sleep subreddit has (11:11 - 11:14)
definitely come together and was like (11:13 - 11:17)
nope Serebii says this this is our (11:14 - 11:19)
results here's video proof here's photo (11:17 - 11:21)
proof like don't go to Serebii for (11:19 - 11:24)
Pokemon sleep stuff so uh if you I I (11:21 - 11:27)
guess if you want accurate sleep uh go (11:24 - 11:29)
to the subreddit and there's a Google (11:27 - 11:32)
doc of a lot of numbers a lot of numbers (11:29 - 11:35)
and it is updated multiple times and uh (11:32 - 11:39)
Serebii has not so uh (11:35 - 11:41)
they they're very into their Pokemon (11:39 - 11:45)
sleep over there you can get very into (11:41 - 11:48)
the game it's really detailed (11:45 - 11:50)
surprisingly (11:48 - 11:53)
so I I would I have not sit down I I (11:50 - 11:55)
have the the Google Doc that (11:53 - 11:57)
it literally updated like two days ago (11:55 - 11:59)
and like the they they have updated (11:57 - 12:02)
things I have it bookmarked I have not (11:59 - 12:04)
sat down and actually like you know I (12:02 - 12:06)
didn't put my glasses on and pull on my (12:04 - 12:08)
pencil and my calculator and and (12:06 - 12:13)
followed along but uh what is what is (12:08 - 12:17)
more what is on it like what (12:13 - 12:19)
uh they have like deeper recipe stuff (12:17 - 12:22)
like I guess I guess there are like (12:19 - 12:24)
there's the basic recipe (12:22 - 12:28)
like five milk and 10 soybeans but (12:24 - 12:30)
they're saying like well if you do these (12:28 - 12:33)
item combinations it's you have a higher (12:30 - 12:36)
chance of getting this they have like (12:33 - 12:38)
these are the EVS you should evolve or (12:36 - 12:40)
should not evolve like they have (12:38 - 12:42)
calculated that berries are actually (12:40 - 12:45)
more beneficial than actually making any (12:42 - 12:47)
meals so they're like put these five (12:45 - 12:49)
Pokemon together to maximize your (12:47 - 12:52)
berries to get to ultra faster (12:49 - 12:53)
um I think Serebii was saying that your (12:52 - 12:55)
pot size would max out at like 40 (12:53 - 12:57)
they're like no you can Max it out at (12:55 - 12:59)
50. (12:57 - 13:01)
um with your dream shards or whatever (12:59 - 13:03)
obviously you get the end of the week (13:01 - 13:04)
bonus (13:03 - 13:05)
they got they got a lot going on over (13:04 - 13:10)
there okay so well good on them yeah I (13:05 - 13:12)
will I will I will I'm so interested in (13:10 - 13:14)
this spreadsheet because so many of them (13:12 - 13:15)
are (13:14 - 13:19)
not fluid I'll send you the spreadsheet (13:15 - 13:22)
send me the spreadsheet how nerdy people (13:19 - 13:24)
are there are 27.5 (13:22 - 13:27)
000 people on the Pokemon sleep (13:24 - 13:29)
subreddits and that existed long before (13:27 - 13:32)
we actually were positive that Pokemon (13:29 - 13:34)
sleep was gonna be a thing I will say (13:32 - 13:36)
that I've been following it for a very (13:34 - 13:38)
long time (13:36 - 13:38)
um (13:40 - 13:42)
yeah so um that's cool I don't use (13:42 - 13:48)
Reddit as much anymore uh with the whole (13:45 - 13:49)
like (13:48 - 13:52)
third-party apps and everything so (13:49 - 13:56)
Reddit and Twitter uh uh are no longer (13:52 - 13:58)
on the home page of my iPhone and (13:56 - 14:00)
there's actually studies that show like (13:58 - 14:01)
if an app makes it to the home page of (14:00 - 14:05)
your phone you are like five times more (14:01 - 14:08)
likely to like open it or whatever (14:05 - 14:09)
um I'm just making up numbers right now (14:08 - 14:10)
but no there's real studies about this (14:09 - 14:13)
if there are studies that say it's more (14:10 - 14:15)
likely don't don't go with what the (14:13 - 14:16)
percentages (14:15 - 14:19)
are just being tossed out (14:16 - 14:21)
yeah so uh (14:19 - 14:23)
and I've been because they're no longer (14:21 - 14:24)
on my (14:23 - 14:27)
home screen I don't I don't use them (14:24 - 14:29)
like five no more than five years ago (14:27 - 14:31)
like eight years ago I think I removed (14:29 - 14:33)
Facebook from my iPhone home screen (14:31 - 14:35)
and I then I deleted it off from my (14:33 - 14:37)
phone altogether so if I want to check (14:35 - 14:39)
Facebook I have to use the computer and (14:37 - 14:40)
it was (14:39 - 14:43)
by far one of the best decisions of my (14:40 - 14:45)
life (14:43 - 14:47)
I think Twitter might be next I can (14:45 - 14:49)
still access Twitter obviously by going (14:47 - 14:50)
to like (14:49 - 14:52)
my folder or whatever yeah garbage (14:50 - 14:55)
folder I threw it into yeah Facebook and (14:52 - 14:58)
Twitter in a folder I just don't (14:55 - 15:01)
I just don't go to Facebook I mean it's (14:58 - 15:04)
odd is it's in the folder that's on what (15:01 - 15:05)
I consider my home screen which is (15:04 - 15:08)
actually my second screen (15:05 - 15:09)
um (15:08 - 15:12)
but I look at it and go (15:09 - 15:15)
no I can't I can't with that today I (15:12 - 15:17)
can't yes I don't have the mental (15:15 - 15:21)
forwarded dude to go into Facebook today (15:17 - 15:23)
I think I think the (15:21 - 15:26)
if I had room on my home screen I think (15:23 - 15:28)
Pokemon sleep would make it there it is (15:26 - 15:31)
it is it is what I I predicted it was (15:28 - 15:33)
going to be all the time all along which (15:31 - 15:35)
is like they want you the Pokemon (15:33 - 15:37)
company wants this to be one of the (15:35 - 15:39)
first apps you (15:37 - 15:43)
open when you wake up you are you and it (15:39 - 15:45)
was one of the last apps you close when (15:43 - 15:50)
you go to sleep like that is that is so (15:45 - 15:55)
desired in the app ecosystem to be (15:50 - 15:58)
a touch point for (15:55 - 16:01)
mobile usage of like first app open last (15:58 - 16:03)
app used (16:01 - 16:06)
I mean it's not that but I do rely on (16:03 - 16:07)
the fact that my phone knows when I use (16:06 - 16:09)
that app so when I pulled on to search (16:07 - 16:12)
it puts it in the row of eight I'm like (16:09 - 16:15)
okay you know when I would pop this open (16:12 - 16:16)
I'll pop it open I'll do my things and (16:15 - 16:18)
close it and move out with my life that (16:16 - 16:20)
works you could also do what I do and (16:18 - 16:21)
have different home screens for (16:20 - 16:22)
different times of day and different (16:21 - 16:24)
days of the week and they just (16:22 - 16:26)
automatically change it's oh okay first (16:24 - 16:30)
off that sounds awesome the amount of (16:26 - 16:33)
discipline you need to set that all up (16:30 - 16:36)
is too much work it used to be it's less (16:33 - 16:39)
work than it used to be I promise (16:36 - 16:42)
less work is still more work than I'm (16:39 - 16:45)
willing to put in like if I can copy and (16:42 - 16:48)
paste other people's I mean I have a I (16:45 - 16:50)
have a home screen that shows up before (16:48 - 16:52)
I go to bed and that just has all the (16:50 - 16:54)
sleep apps and it's great they're all (16:52 - 16:57)
just right there I don't need to bother (16:54 - 16:59)
I mean I literally (16:57 - 17:02)
for the probably 17 (16:59 - 17:06)
000 apps that I have on my phone (17:02 - 17:10)
I would argue that I use six (17:06 - 17:10)
down so hard I don't I have a games (17:10 - 17:16)
folder full of games that I have not (17:14 - 17:18)
touched (17:17 - 17:21)
in probably five years do I want to get (17:18 - 17:24)
rid of it no because what if what if (17:21 - 17:26)
you're on the toilet and Clash Royale is (17:24 - 17:28)
calling your name what if I hear the (17:26 - 17:30)
call of the Hog Rider and that's (17:28 - 17:35)
friendly forced to go back in no like (17:30 - 17:39)
slack Tick Tock Pokemon Masters (17:35 - 17:41)
Instagram Snapchat (17:39 - 17:44)
that's pretty much we're still using (17:41 - 17:47)
SnapChat look you are not a part of my (17:44 - 17:49)
community where Snapchat is very vital (17:47 - 17:53)
for certain transactions (17:49 - 17:53)
these are my transactions you know he's (17:55 - 17:59)
coming to Pokemon sleep (17:57 - 18:00)
he's coming to Pokemon sleep but he's (17:59 - 18:03)
gonna be on the blue Beach (18:00 - 18:07)
that's true the Shiny Snorlax Beach (18:03 - 18:07)
it's confusing on that Beach (18:09 - 18:14)
because this is called chaos Beach (18:12 - 18:16)
because nobody knows it look I just (18:14 - 18:18)
finally unlock the third island today so (18:16 - 18:20)
don't go don't go to it it's just (18:18 - 18:24)
geodudes it's not just geodudes and the (18:20 - 18:27)
music is amazing Muse this game has (18:24 - 18:29)
music (18:27 - 18:29)
the music on the third island is (18:29 - 18:33)
incredible and I want to be there all (18:31 - 18:35)
the time but my Pokemon aren't a high (18:33 - 18:37)
enough level yet that would require me (18:35 - 18:41)
to take my phone off silent for the (18:37 - 18:45)
first time in probably 15 years a thing (18:41 - 18:48)
that will never happen no you all the (18:45 - 18:49)
only time I ever took my phone off (18:48 - 18:51)
silent was when I played Clash Royale (18:49 - 18:53)
because you had to hear you had to hear (18:51 - 18:55)
yeah you had to hear that yeah you had (18:53 - 18:57)
to hear the units that were hiding (18:55 - 19:00)
behind other units did you chastise (18:57 - 19:04)
William Anderson for the end of (19:00 - 19:07)
communities and go fests when he turns (19:04 - 19:10)
that phone on loud and puts out all the (19:07 - 19:14)
Pokemon Go music and sounds just to (19:10 - 19:16)
torture us all (19:14 - 19:19)
no I I genuinely think the Pokemon go (19:16 - 19:23)
sounds are ear piercingly bad they are (19:19 - 19:25)
and he turns it out at the end of the (19:23 - 19:27)
day it's like the bar flipping on the (19:25 - 19:29)
lights that's right because he wants he (19:27 - 19:31)
wants us to tell him to leave so he (19:29 - 19:33)
doesn't have to so he doesn't have to be (19:31 - 19:36)
the one that leaves it's true (19:33 - 19:39)
no I I cannot believe after seven years (19:36 - 19:42)
of Pokemon go they still have like the (19:39 - 19:46)
same oh it's it's terrible have you ever (19:42 - 19:47)
listened to like go battling with the (19:46 - 19:49)
sound on it's like (19:47 - 19:53)
and you're like what what is this (19:49 - 19:57)
so my earphones glitched on my walk the (19:53 - 20:01)
other day because I had the sound off (19:57 - 20:04)
and I was listening to my podcast and I (20:01 - 20:06)
was doing some dumb thing I had to do (20:04 - 20:08)
for that game and (20:06 - 20:10)
suddenly I started playing the noises (20:08 - 20:13)
and I'm like this why are you doing this (20:10 - 20:17)
to me this is literal torture I am I am (20:13 - 20:21)
calling somebody to complain how dare (20:17 - 20:22)
you suddenly start playing these sounds (20:21 - 20:25)
to be over the podcast because it didn't (20:22 - 20:27)
kill the other one so I had these people (20:25 - 20:29)
talking to me to these barrels (20:27 - 20:34)
I'm like this is madness I'm not gonna (20:29 - 20:36)
survived this walk I have to stop and (20:34 - 20:38)
restart my phone (20:36 - 20:42)
the the it's it's awful the Pokemon go (20:38 - 20:44)
sound is just so bad just being a (20:42 - 20:45)
Pokemon go let's get the mobile stuff (20:44 - 20:47)
out of the way uh (20:45 - 20:50)
the Community Day for grubbin is (20:47 - 20:54)
Saturday September 23rd from two to five (20:50 - 20:56)
uh (20:54 - 20:59)
you will need a magnetic lure to evolve (20:56 - 21:02)
charge a bug into vicavolt it's saying (20:59 - 21:05)
that uh (21:02 - 21:07)
you will have five hours after the event (21:05 - 21:11)
to get the fast attack of volt switch (21:07 - 21:13)
so you don't have to like Panic evolve (21:11 - 21:15)
or I don't know (21:13 - 21:17)
hopefully people are putting it on (21:15 - 21:19)
magnetic so you don't have to spend your (21:17 - 21:21)
own money there will be a dollar (21:19 - 21:22)
research there's three times the (21:21 - 21:25)
catching XP two times catch candy (21:22 - 21:29)
incense for uh three hours one (21:25 - 21:31)
additional special trade trades will be (21:29 - 21:33)
fifty percent less Stardust hey uh (21:31 - 21:35)
speaking of special trades that is not a (21:33 - 21:38)
bonus for classic Community Day and (21:35 - 21:40)
because the season rotated out I did my (21:38 - 21:42)
one special trade on classic and then I (21:40 - 21:44)
was like oh it's Community Day we get (21:42 - 21:46)
two special trade that's that's not a (21:44 - 21:50)
bonus on classic that was (21:46 - 21:53)
one of the most disappointing look look (21:50 - 21:55)
Pokemon go this can can vary much (21:53 - 21:57)
disappoint there's no there's no shyness (21:55 - 22:00)
in their ability to disappoint you but (21:57 - 22:03)
hahaha (22:00 - 22:06)
I feel like the days you do trade are (22:03 - 22:09)
probably around and or actually on (22:06 - 22:11)
Community Day so only having one special (22:09 - 22:12)
trade was (22:11 - 22:16)
it felt kind of bad I completely forgot (22:12 - 22:18)
it was a thing (22:16 - 22:18)
one other cool thing about (22:18 - 22:24)
that it's not just make a fault that (22:21 - 22:24)
will be (22:24 - 22:27)
special attack uh charger bug will also (22:24 - 22:29)
get the special attack if you evolve (22:27 - 22:31)
grubbing into charge a bug because (22:29 - 22:33)
charge a bug is particularly good for (22:31 - 22:35)
some parts of PVP (22:33 - 22:39)
oh that's cool I like him he's a little (22:35 - 22:42)
Cube exactly (22:39 - 22:42)
um (22:43 - 22:49)
yeah so uh Community Day and then uh (22:44 - 22:51)
there's like an Oddish research Day (22:49 - 22:53)
that's coming (22:51 - 22:55)
that is Sunday September 17th from two (22:53 - 22:57)
to five if you're lucky you might (22:55 - 23:00)
encounter a shiny Oddish those will be (22:57 - 23:02)
the field research that you get from the (23:00 - 23:04)
disc the photo discs so you spin get the (23:02 - 23:06)
research do the research maybe it's (23:04 - 23:07)
Oddish (23:06 - 23:08)
good luck (23:07 - 23:10)
uh (23:08 - 23:12)
that's like (23:10 - 23:14)
that's fine I guess (23:12 - 23:16)
are pretty good (23:14 - 23:19)
yeah they're fine (23:16 - 23:21)
it's just like the Pokemon never seems (23:19 - 23:24)
like that terribly exciting but (23:21 - 23:27)
another gen 1 Pokemon (23:24 - 23:29)
but they went all in on Oddish in the (23:27 - 23:32)
last week after it has been nothing but (23:29 - 23:34)
Oddish (23:32 - 23:39)
after the TCG animated series ended (23:34 - 23:42)
which was very good by the way (23:39 - 23:42)
Journey so I'm done (23:46 - 23:51)
you're done you finished it all I (23:49 - 23:54)
finished it all uh before we get to Ash (23:51 - 23:58)
uh last bit of news here is they put out (23:54 - 23:58)
a five dollar palmy research (23:59 - 24:05)
Hannah how do you feel about this (24:03 - 24:07)
it's five dollars for the backpack is (24:05 - 24:09)
what it is (24:07 - 24:12)
I mean the research exists but it's just (24:09 - 24:13)
if you want the backpack (24:12 - 24:16)
and I I mean it's a cute backpack but (24:13 - 24:19)
I'm not gonna get that (24:16 - 24:21)
uh (24:19 - 24:25)
it's not even like research though (24:21 - 24:28)
you have to walk (24:25 - 24:28)
sure (24:28 - 24:32)
that that is (24:30 - 24:35)
the new tag like a Pokemon go you have (24:32 - 24:36)
to walk (24:35 - 24:39)
look I (24:36 - 24:42)
I'm a sucker oh and I like to give (24:39 - 24:45)
Pokemon money this is this is no (24:42 - 24:49)
surprise I spent 35 on a Kramer ant skin (24:45 - 24:50)
in Pokemon Unite (24:49 - 24:54)
like I I I I've been here uh (24:50 - 24:57)
have you decided to come back to get the (24:54 - 24:59)
new crameran skin that's part of the (24:57 - 25:01)
battle pass yeah I will literally buy (24:59 - 25:02)
the battle pass and then not play it (25:01 - 25:06)
because it's like the first unlock yeah (25:02 - 25:06)
uh it's cool that they did a Kramer and (25:09 - 25:14)
battle pass but I don't know dlc's in (25:11 - 25:15)
like three days so it's not like I (25:14 - 25:17)
really have time to get in to unite (25:15 - 25:17)
again (25:17 - 25:19)
this is what you're getting though for (25:17 - 25:21)
five dollars you're getting two (25:19 - 25:23)
encounters with palmy I'm pretty sure I (25:21 - 25:25)
can see two palmy in my house right now (25:23 - 25:27)
for the record you're getting the (25:25 - 25:29)
backpack you're getting three count them (25:27 - 25:33)
one two three rare candies (25:29 - 25:35)
you're getting one incubator not a super (25:33 - 25:38)
incubator just a regular one you're (25:35 - 25:40)
getting 10 silver pin apps (25:38 - 25:43)
921 Stardust that's because it's Pokedex (25:40 - 25:45)
number is 921. (25:43 - 25:46)
and (25:45 - 25:51)
9210 XP if you don't finish it by Friday (25:46 - 25:55)
September 15th you get no backpack (25:51 - 25:58)
there is a possibility here (25:55 - 26:01)
that you spend five dollars not finish (25:58 - 26:05)
this research and not get the backpack I (26:01 - 26:07)
want to repeat that there's a (26:05 - 26:09)
possibility when you spend five dollars (26:07 - 26:12)
and not get what you paid for which is (26:09 - 26:14)
already (26:12 - 26:16)
overpriced (26:14 - 26:20)
first thing it's like uh it's it's it (26:16 - 26:22)
looks like a palmy that's riding on your (26:20 - 26:24)
back yeah yeah it's very it is very cute (26:22 - 26:26)
no one's denying that (26:24 - 26:29)
no one can say the backpack isn't cute (26:26 - 26:30)
it is cute (26:29 - 26:32)
and there are even some poses you can (26:30 - 26:34)
combine with it that will actually make (26:32 - 26:36)
it visible in your avatar when other (26:34 - 26:37)
people look at it (26:36 - 26:39)
I like the backpack I would wear the (26:37 - 26:41)
backpack I think I'm wearing the kecleon (26:39 - 26:42)
backpack right now in Pokemon go or (26:41 - 26:44)
whatever I think that was like two bucks (26:42 - 26:46)
or something I don't remember (26:44 - 26:48)
um (26:46 - 26:48)
there was like a Halloween research last (26:48 - 26:54)
year that came with like uh the Avatar (26:51 - 26:56)
holding the lantern or something like (26:54 - 26:58)
that and I want to say that was like (26:56 - 27:01)
five dollars but also that quest line (26:58 - 27:05)
was like pretty long I remember like (27:01 - 27:06)
getting past the first part being like (27:05 - 27:09)
Oh okay cool second part and then being (27:06 - 27:11)
like Oh another part like oh this is (27:09 - 27:14)
never gonna end yeah I was like oh and I (27:11 - 27:16)
remember it being limited as well I'm (27:14 - 27:17)
pretty sure where you had to finish it (27:16 - 27:18)
within like a week or something (27:17 - 27:21)
to get the the (27:18 - 27:23)
Lantern pose which I I think the lantern (27:21 - 27:25)
pose is cool like I I knew going in that (27:23 - 27:27)
I was like okay cool I want the lantern (27:25 - 27:29)
pose (27:27 - 27:29)
but that I like (27:30 - 27:33)
when I say like oh I didn't realize it (27:31 - 27:35)
was kind of long like I enjoyed it it (27:33 - 27:38)
was something to do like this is when (27:35 - 27:40)
the research was actually sizable it can (27:38 - 27:44)
add enjoyment to the game this is (27:40 - 27:46)
walking (27:44 - 27:50)
that's that's just it and it's one step (27:46 - 27:55)
and then you're done oh yeah and it's (27:50 - 27:55)
like it (27:55 - 27:58)
I don't even uh it's it's almost like (27:58 - 28:05)
insulting I mean because it's timed it's (28:01 - 28:08)
probably good that it's not too long (28:05 - 28:10)
paid timed research is really one of the (28:08 - 28:12)
worst I don't know there are a lot of (28:10 - 28:15)
what if you paid for research and it (28:12 - 28:18)
wasn't timed like that's there's like (28:15 - 28:21)
two different discussions here one (28:18 - 28:23)
you're paying for something that is is (28:21 - 28:24)
so (28:23 - 28:27)
it feels so much like an afterthought (28:24 - 28:29)
like yep here's just one incubator (28:27 - 28:31)
here's the backpack by the way you can (28:29 - 28:34)
get the backpack in the store like a (28:31 - 28:36)
week later right which was gonna be like (28:34 - 28:39)
500 coins yeah I could just spend that (28:36 - 28:41)
and then not walk and then sit on my (28:39 - 28:43)
couch and be like I have the backpack I (28:41 - 28:45)
didn't know you won't have the little (28:43 - 28:47)
line in your completed research list (28:45 - 28:49)
yeah that's true you know I'm actively (28:47 - 28:51)
updating my LinkedIn for every completed (28:49 - 28:54)
research I did I probably should but I (28:51 - 28:56)
think the bigger discussion is like why (28:54 - 28:59)
are we paying for like I understand a (28:56 - 29:01)
battle pass a battle pass is like 90 (28:59 - 29:04)
days you get multiple rewards on the (29:01 - 29:07)
track this is five dollars get it done (29:04 - 29:10)
by Friday if you don't get it the one (29:07 - 29:12)
actual thing of value in here the (29:10 - 29:14)
backpack is it's gone and then it will (29:12 - 29:15)
appear in the store where you can (29:14 - 29:17)
actually buy it again like what is (29:15 - 29:20)
happening it's not I know they laid off (29:17 - 29:23)
200 people but who hit publish on this (29:20 - 29:25)
who did not like look at somebody else (29:23 - 29:26)
and been like (29:25 - 29:29)
maybe we should respect our players like (29:26 - 29:32)
by five extra percent (29:29 - 29:34)
that does not sound like the company (29:32 - 29:37)
I've been dealing with for seven years (29:34 - 29:39)
even the gallerian Mr mime which was (29:37 - 29:42)
like eight bucks you got a Mr mime you (29:39 - 29:44)
got like the pose you actually got other (29:42 - 29:46)
things that were like (29:44 - 29:50)
added up to to eight dollars like we I (29:46 - 29:51)
remember Greg and I broke down the math (29:50 - 29:53)
and Greg was like I'm not gonna use (29:51 - 29:54)
these items and I'm like I'm gonna use (29:53 - 29:56)
these items but here (29:54 - 29:58)
the things that you break down are what (29:56 - 30:02)
one incubator (29:58 - 30:02)
yeah the backpack on its own it's gonna (30:02 - 30:07)
cost five bucks (30:04 - 30:07)
yeah I guess (30:08 - 30:11)
that's pretty much it's the backpack in (30:11 - 30:16)
the incubator (30:13 - 30:16)
it's it's not great (30:16 - 30:19)
I don't know why there wasn't why this (30:20 - 30:24)
wasn't at the start of the paldaya event (30:22 - 30:27)
and there wasn't something to go along (30:24 - 30:28)
because the pal day event's two weeks (30:27 - 30:32)
right so why wasn't this backpack (30:28 - 30:34)
the start of last week (30:32 - 30:38)
yeah I I get that but like the bag like (30:34 - 30:40)
getting a bit of a palmy backpack like (30:38 - 30:43)
seven days early is not ruining anyone's (30:40 - 30:45)
enjoyment of Tommy coming to Pokemon go (30:43 - 30:48)
if anything a lot of people (30:45 - 30:51)
nepalmy is now is right now they've (30:48 - 30:53)
never seen it before (30:51 - 30:57)
yeah I guess I did an Instagram poll 18 (30:53 - 31:00)
of people said they were buying this (30:57 - 31:03)
backpack which is too much that's too (31:00 - 31:05)
many that's too many percents that is (31:03 - 31:07)
too many percentages of people giving (31:05 - 31:11)
Niantic five dollars I just want to say (31:07 - 31:12)
yeah (31:11 - 31:15)
oh here (31:12 - 31:19)
send me five dollars (31:15 - 31:19)
I won't complete anything for you it (31:19 - 31:24)
will be just as disappointing but I'll (31:22 - 31:27)
have five dollars (31:24 - 31:27)
if I want to buy research and like force (31:29 - 31:33)
myself to play a game I just want it to (31:31 - 31:34)
be like (31:33 - 31:36)
enjoy (31:34 - 31:38)
able I want to enjoy the game of playing (31:36 - 31:40)
I guess (31:38 - 31:40)
it's fine though I got a couple big Le (31:41 - 31:46)
chunks I was pretty happy (31:44 - 31:49)
I think the XP bonus on the current (31:46 - 31:51)
event is really good I will say that (31:49 - 31:54)
it's great yeah it's like four times XP (31:51 - 31:56)
four times Stardust or whatever it's (31:54 - 31:57)
amazing (31:56 - 31:59)
they're um (31:57 - 32:02)
lastly before we go to break uh Mr (31:59 - 32:05)
Brandon tan which if you guys do not (32:02 - 32:08)
know who he is I believe he still has (32:05 - 32:10)
the most XP in the entire world for (32:08 - 32:12)
Pokemon go he was not the first to level (32:10 - 32:14)
50 that was uh somebody else named (32:12 - 32:16)
fleece King (32:14 - 32:20)
um Brandon is from Singapore originally (32:16 - 32:23)
and uh I guess he was at Mall of America (32:20 - 32:25)
yesterday I did not know this until (32:23 - 32:27)
somebody who does not live in Minnesota (32:25 - 32:28)
told me are you going to Mall of America (32:27 - 32:31)
there will be a golden lure party and I (32:28 - 32:33)
was like well this would have been nice (32:31 - 32:35)
to know a week ago because I I am not (32:33 - 32:38)
close to unlocking a golden lure (32:35 - 32:39)
um but that's fine I could probably (32:38 - 32:42)
swing by for like a half hour or an hour (32:39 - 32:44)
because the golden alert lasts half hour (32:42 - 32:48)
uh I was a little late and I would not (32:44 - 32:50)
say that four stops at Mall of America (32:48 - 32:54)
having Golden Lures was a party hmm it's (32:50 - 32:55)
more than one (32:54 - 32:57)
uh but (32:55 - 33:00)
uh that probably could have been (32:57 - 33:04)
better advertised and or (33:00 - 33:07)
maybe like message some local (33:04 - 33:09)
communities I don't know how like (33:07 - 33:11)
I don't know how busy this dude is he (33:09 - 33:13)
has the most XP in Pokemon go maybe (33:11 - 33:15)
maybe you could ask some of his (33:13 - 33:17)
community to message other communities (33:15 - 33:19)
to actually try to organize something (33:17 - 33:21)
ahead of time enough that people could (33:19 - 33:25)
actually get the lures yeah yeah uh but (33:21 - 33:27)
you know like I said I was a little late (33:25 - 33:29)
so maybe they started early because they (33:27 - 33:30)
said they were starting at two I got (33:29 - 33:32)
there at like (33:30 - 33:35)
uh like 229 and so maybe they were (33:32 - 33:37)
popping their lures at like you know 145 (33:35 - 33:39)
or something and the first batch already (33:37 - 33:41)
like so maybe I only saw the second (33:39 - 33:44)
batch which was only like four or five (33:41 - 33:45)
um (33:44 - 33:48)
but that was a bit disappointing uh to (33:45 - 33:50)
be like oh cool uh last minute golden (33:48 - 33:52)
lure party oh that wasn't like I was (33:50 - 33:53)
literally going to text Greg and will (33:52 - 33:57)
but like I didn't know until 11 p.m that (33:53 - 33:59)
night and I was like I was gonna be mad (33:57 - 34:01)
at me if I text him at 11 P.M (33:59 - 34:02)
you'd be asleep but it wouldn't have (34:01 - 34:04)
happened he wouldn't be asleep yeah and (34:02 - 34:05)
then if I text him in the morning they (34:04 - 34:06)
would have been like you didn't give me (34:05 - 34:08)
enough time and it's like I literally (34:06 - 34:10)
found out (34:08 - 34:14)
so uh that was a bit of a bummer but (34:10 - 34:15)
I think that dude's like traveling to (34:14 - 34:17)
other places to do the same thing so I (34:15 - 34:19)
don't know if you're (34:17 - 34:21)
if you follow him I don't know maybe (34:19 - 34:23)
check out his Twitter I don't even know (34:21 - 34:24)
who this person is (34:23 - 34:27)
uh so he was the like the first I think (34:24 - 34:29)
he was the first person to level 40 in (34:27 - 34:32)
Pokemon go he is the most XP I think he (34:29 - 34:35)
still has the most XP but the we did (34:32 - 34:36)
talk about him on the show before Greg (34:35 - 34:38)
he was banned from Pokemon go for 30 (34:36 - 34:41)
days because people would he started a (34:38 - 34:44)
service where if you paid him money and (34:41 - 34:47)
gave him your Pokemon go account he (34:44 - 34:49)
would play for you (34:47 - 34:52)
um so you could be like here's here's (34:49 - 34:54)
forty dollars I would like a shiny (34:52 - 34:57)
Reshiram and you would then give him (34:54 - 34:58)
your login and then he would get you a (34:57 - 35:00)
shiny restroom keep in mind you still (34:58 - 35:03)
have to provide the raid passes and the (35:00 - 35:05)
you you had to like fill up your account (35:03 - 35:08)
and then give it to him uh that's uh on (35:05 - 35:10)
several levels against TOS the first one (35:08 - 35:12)
being uh you're not supposed to share (35:10 - 35:15)
your accounts uh the second one is you (35:12 - 35:17)
are not supposed to pay people to play (35:15 - 35:19)
Pokemon go for you (35:17 - 35:21)
so uh he did that for quite a while (35:19 - 35:23)
before I think he did it for a year or (35:21 - 35:25)
two before Niantic finally (35:23 - 35:28)
banned them for 30 days (35:25 - 35:28)
um (35:28 - 35:31)
I I think that's an awfully long time to (35:28 - 35:34)
let that continue (35:31 - 35:36)
sure is (35:34 - 35:39)
yeah uh you know (35:36 - 35:41)
I don't think (35:39 - 35:43)
you know this is the same company who (35:41 - 35:45)
just put out a five dollar limited time (35:43 - 35:47)
research for a backpack you know so yeah (35:45 - 35:49)
you get a backpack for just walking what (35:47 - 35:50)
more do you want I don't think they have (35:49 - 35:52)
all their ducks in a row when it comes (35:50 - 35:55)
to the you know doing things in a a fast (35:52 - 35:58)
order but (35:55 - 35:59)
um (35:58 - 36:03)
all right uh let's take a a quick break (35:59 - 36:04)
uh when we come back we'll talk about (36:03 - 36:06)
some (36:04 - 36:09)
Ash and some DLC and whatever else is on (36:06 - 36:11)
the docket so we will be right back (36:09 - 36:15)
and we are back from our break uh so (36:11 - 36:18)
first off there's a uh free sit Titan (36:15 - 36:20)
that is available (36:18 - 36:24)
uh you can add a they say special sit (36:20 - 36:26)
Titan to your team (36:24 - 36:29)
um this is just a yes this is to (36:26 - 36:30)
celebrate (36:29 - 36:34)
what's it called paldaya wins (36:30 - 36:37)
yeah it's really good too it is ah this (36:34 - 36:40)
is a level 50 ferocious Mark citation so (36:37 - 36:43)
tighten the rampaging uh with a password (36:40 - 36:46)
like a flute that will expire August (36:43 - 36:48)
31st (36:46 - 36:50)
2024. if you're thinking August 31st (36:48 - 36:54)
this next year now you got a whole year (36:50 - 36:54)
um to to get this to tighten (36:55 - 36:59)
unfortunately it does not come in a (36:57 - 37:00)
cherish ball which is a bit of a bummer (36:59 - 37:02)
but it does have (37:00 - 37:04)
the a personality Mark which is normally (37:02 - 37:06)
a one (37:04 - 37:10)
in a hundred chance of having (37:06 - 37:12)
um but because there are so many (37:10 - 37:15)
personality marks uh (37:12 - 37:17)
it's hard to say like I specifically (37:15 - 37:20)
want this one (37:17 - 37:23)
so uh there is again there is there is (37:20 - 37:24)
some rareness to that especially if you (37:23 - 37:27)
like to Mark hunt (37:24 - 37:30)
um you could (37:27 - 37:34)
you probably don't have one now you do (37:30 - 37:36)
so uh we don't need to get into the (37:34 - 37:38)
argument about (37:36 - 37:40)
Rarity here but (37:38 - 37:42)
you can make a case for it being pretty (37:40 - 37:45)
rare compared to a Shiny Pokemon and why (37:42 - 37:46)
don't they give a Shiny Pokemon they (37:45 - 37:49)
just gave you a shiny Arcanine like a (37:46 - 37:50)
month ago calm down (37:49 - 37:53)
that was a shiny legendary the legendary (37:50 - 37:55)
Pokemon Arcanine yeah it's in the (37:53 - 37:57)
Pokedex (37:55 - 37:59)
uh do we know how many episodes of Hell (37:57 - 38:02)
Dan wins they're supposed to be (37:59 - 38:05)
is that four um oh I don't know off the (38:02 - 38:08)
top of my head I I wanted I want to say (38:05 - 38:11)
eight but I have no basis for saying (38:08 - 38:13)
that yeah for some reason my gut says (38:11 - 38:16)
six but I also have no basis uh (38:13 - 38:20)
Bulbapedia is saying four oh real short (38:16 - 38:25)
uh but I pass the peak was also for yeah (38:20 - 38:25)
so (38:26 - 38:30)
uh I'll wait I'll wait I watched past (38:28 - 38:32)
the peak when all four came out I watch (38:30 - 38:35)
all Peppa Pig I watched it all (38:32 - 38:39)
no no I did not (38:35 - 38:39)
I feel like path to the peak had (38:40 - 38:44)
um (38:43 - 38:45)
it appealed to me a little bit more (38:44 - 38:47)
because I used to play competitive TCG (38:45 - 38:51)
and it was a 100 accurate as far as I (38:47 - 38:53)
could tell how competitive TCG goes yeah (38:51 - 38:55)
correct everyone fist bumps you and has (38:53 - 38:57)
a great time uh history and snow I don't (38:55 - 38:58)
know I didn't see I don't see people (38:57 - 39:02)
dying in the snowstorm (38:58 - 39:02)
nobody (39:02 - 39:09)
dies technically it's good it's sweet I (39:04 - 39:11)
will I'll get around to his own stuff (39:09 - 39:13)
but I'll wait I got I'll wait for (39:11 - 39:15)
because how how long is the first (39:13 - 39:17)
episode of pale Dan wins 10 minutes (39:15 - 39:19)
seven hours (39:17 - 39:19)
it was like 10 minutes yeah maybe 11. so (39:20 - 39:27)
like sitting down and watching like 40 (39:25 - 39:29)
minutes (39:27 - 39:32)
wasn't was it was very felt very easy (39:29 - 39:35)
for past the peak (39:32 - 39:35)
yeah I just gotta I just gotta you know (39:41 - 39:45)
sit down and do I look I can't watch two (39:43 - 39:47)
Pokemon Animes in a night you think I'm (39:45 - 39:48)
supposed to finish past the peak and (39:47 - 39:50)
then jump over to Hisui and Snow Yeah (39:48 - 39:54)
because you're in the Pokemon mood (39:50 - 39:58)
oh oh it's true not my mistake I mean so (39:54 - 40:00)
is it like only three episodes and (39:58 - 40:01)
they're like I think it's three ten (40:00 - 40:03)
minutes each it was like 30 minutes of (40:01 - 40:04)
your life (40:03 - 40:06)
you can't go over the hour mark (40:04 - 40:08)
I was under I was under the the 60 (40:06 - 40:10)
Seconds (40:08 - 40:13)
the 60 Minutes uh speaking of anime I (40:10 - 40:15)
will we'll jump from anime to anime here (40:13 - 40:16)
before we get to the Scarlet Violet (40:15 - 40:20)
stuff uh part four of Pokemon ultimate (40:16 - 40:22)
Journeys the series is now on Netflix (40:20 - 40:26)

Misty Brock uh Team Rocket wait does (40:46 - 40:52)
does Tracy appear yes (40:49 - 40:55)
oh all right all right all right uh I'm (40:52 - 40:59)
assuming silent yes silent uh was about (40:55 - 41:01)
the guy with the backpack The Invention (40:59 - 41:02)
guy (41:01 - 41:05)
clemont no come on come on does not (41:02 - 41:07)
appear oh (41:05 - 41:10)
they did Club on 30. (41:07 - 41:13)
I thought everyone loved X and Y (41:10 - 41:15)
what about the guy with the the (41:13 - 41:17)
Charizard that destroyed Ash in the uh (41:15 - 41:19)
tournament (41:17 - 41:19)
Masters eight and they didn't battle (41:20 - 41:27)
oh was he in the Masters eight (41:23 - 41:29)
I look I'm we just discussed I'm very (41:27 - 41:32)
far behind an anime apparently (41:29 - 41:35)
I'm kind of I mean Irish already so I (41:32 - 41:39)
Iris was in the masterate yeah (41:35 - 41:39)
um I have watched all 12 episodes (41:40 - 41:45)
because I don't have a job so what what (41:42 - 41:47)
am I doing with my life (41:45 - 41:50)
so I just watched them (41:47 - 41:53)
I will say (41:50 - 41:53)
I found the opening credits sequence (41:54 - 41:59)
surprisingly emotional (41:57 - 42:02)
having been with this anime for a way (41:59 - 42:04)
too long they picked some very good (42:02 - 42:05)
moments to put it in the other thing (42:04 - 42:07)
you're like oh I remember that it's like (42:05 - 42:09)
a Nostalgia hit that I found very (42:07 - 42:13)
emotional I think okay (42:09 - 42:16)
you know how there's Filler episodes (42:13 - 42:19)
oh yeah this is 12 Filler episodes (42:16 - 42:21)
really it is (42:19 - 42:24)
there they I won't warn you now they (42:21 - 42:25)
aren't (42:24 - 42:28)
doing anything ground breaking they are (42:25 - 42:33)
enjoy revealing Untold Ash Secrets it is (42:28 - 42:36)
wait he's not in a coma he's not (42:33 - 42:39)
surprisingly no although (42:36 - 42:43)
there are things that you're like huh (42:39 - 42:45)
okay you did that sure right that was (42:43 - 42:47)
the weirdest thing you've done in a (42:45 - 42:48)
while (42:47 - 42:49)
um (42:48 - 42:55)
overall as a way to say goodbye to a (42:49 - 42:57)
character (42:55 - 43:01)
how they focus and portray Ash in these (42:57 - 43:03)
12 episodes (43:01 - 43:07)
is I think probably one of the best (43:03 - 43:10)
character send-offs a show has done (43:07 - 43:13)
they really do do a good job of (43:10 - 43:17)
reminding you why ash was a good main (43:13 - 43:21)
character and what Ash brought to the (43:17 - 43:23)
series Without (43:21 - 43:25)
really get it it's they're all light (43:23 - 43:27)
like you don't (43:25 - 43:30)
you don't need there's not there's not (43:27 - 43:32)
plot there's not plots there's not (43:30 - 43:33)
there's nothing there's nothing (43:32 - 43:36)
happening it's just the opening sequence (43:33 - 43:37)
emotional or is all of the thing (43:36 - 43:39)
emotional (43:37 - 43:40)
um (43:39 - 43:43)
there are times where there's emotional (43:40 - 43:46)
Parts I think the final the final final (43:43 - 43:49)
saying goodbye to sort of everybody (43:46 - 43:54)
uh uh which is actually episode 11. (43:49 - 43:57)
um episode 12. I need people to watch it (43:54 - 44:01)
to verify what I'm thinking they did (43:57 - 44:03)
um (44:01 - 44:05)
but uh (44:03 - 44:08)
there's no there's no marriage sequence (44:05 - 44:12)
between him and Serena no nor (44:08 - 44:15)
ladios or Latias which I'm just (44:12 - 44:17)
surprised this is gonna be a dirty dog (44:15 - 44:19)
his entire life (44:17 - 44:20)
um (44:19 - 44:23)
they do a lot of really nice things and (44:20 - 44:24)
do a really good character study for ash (44:23 - 44:26)
but again you don't have to pay a lot of (44:24 - 44:27)
attention to what's going on because (44:26 - 44:30)
it's pretty much standard filler episode (44:27 - 44:32)
plot lines right like (44:30 - 44:34)
I mean literally literally first light (44:32 - 44:37)
of the narrator is which Pokemon are we (44:34 - 44:39)
gonna meet today and that's literally (44:37 - 44:42)
all the episodes are (44:39 - 44:42)
I still think like (44:43 - 44:47)
maybe it's maybe it's me I mean Greg and (44:48 - 44:54)
I we we uh we even though Greg is older (44:51 - 44:56)
than me we've spent the same amount of (44:54 - 44:59)
time with the anime right like (44:56 - 45:02)
Hannah too I'm assuming uh but (44:59 - 45:05)
uh I just feel like they just dropped (45:02 - 45:07)
the ball on this send-off (45:05 - 45:10)
so hard the fact that we knew that he (45:07 - 45:11)
won (45:10 - 45:14)
feels like a year ago and then they did (45:11 - 45:16)
that send off earlier this year for (45:14 - 45:18)
Japan and it was like on all the (45:16 - 45:20)
televisions in Japan of like him winning (45:18 - 45:23)
and everything and like we just got it (45:20 - 45:26)
this past week and it like even we're (45:23 - 45:29)
reading a pokemon.com article (45:26 - 45:32)
like it like there is no Fanfare around (45:29 - 45:34)
this because they already did they (45:32 - 45:36)
already did it but they did it to one (45:34 - 45:39)
country in the entire world which you (45:36 - 45:40)
could maybe argue is the most important (45:39 - 45:44)
country for the Pokemon anime (45:40 - 45:44)
uh I don't know I just (45:45 - 45:49)
it just feels like that was a moment (45:48 - 45:51)
that the world could have shared (45:49 - 45:53)
together yes I agree with that and it (45:51 - 45:56)
didn't happen no so it was like 25 years (45:53 - 45:57)
of like (45:56 - 46:01)
25 years for Japan but like 26 years for (45:57 - 46:04)
everyone else (46:01 - 46:04)
a worldwide cultural moment is gone (46:07 - 46:12)
um (46:11 - 46:15)
I do think (46:12 - 46:17)
that (46:15 - 46:21)
that part missing as a PR if you've what (46:17 - 46:23)
like and I haven't completed every anime (46:21 - 46:24)
series but I've been watching that anime (46:23 - 46:26)
for (46:24 - 46:28)
ever since it first came on right like (46:26 - 46:29)
there are parts that I've skipped like I (46:28 - 46:31)
still haven't finished all of sun and (46:29 - 46:33)
moon (46:31 - 46:34)
um (46:33 - 46:38)
I do think like if you have ever sort of (46:34 - 46:42)
watched the anime and just have been (46:38 - 46:45)
have had Ash as a part of your cultural (46:42 - 46:48)
background this is a very excellent 12 (46:45 - 46:51)
episode way to say (46:48 - 46:55)
goodbye to this character for now right (46:51 - 46:59)
like they close it out you're like (46:55 - 47:02)
cool that was nice it was good to see (46:59 - 47:05)
what made Ash Ash and what what's good (47:02 - 47:06)
about that character and they did it (47:05 - 47:09)
really well although I do not care for (47:06 - 47:12)
Misty's new voice (47:09 - 47:12)
oh I didn't know they changed it yeah I (47:12 - 47:16)
I'm pretty sure it's different it (47:14 - 47:19)
sounded very different to me (47:16 - 47:20)
um (47:19 - 47:24)
and I didn't I was like it's okay (47:20 - 47:24)
uh this is off uh just Santa Cruz (47:31 - 47:38)
skateboards.com apparently there are new (47:35 - 47:40)
skateboards coming that are not bear (47:38 - 47:44)
Walker skateboards (47:40 - 47:47)
these are skateboard skateboards which (47:44 - 47:49)
I mean so sorry bear walkers but bear (47:47 - 47:52)
Walkers are more like Cruisers they (47:49 - 47:54)
don't have like a nose or a tail they're (47:52 - 47:57)
they're flat (47:54 - 47:59)
you can't really I mean I'm sure (47:57 - 48:01)
somebody could pop an ollie on a cruiser (47:59 - 48:03)
but it would be a lot harder because (48:01 - 48:05)
they're they're gonna get skills (48:03 - 48:08)
I (48:05 - 48:08)
they're blind bags (48:09 - 48:16)
yeah they are what (48:12 - 48:19)
what (48:16 - 48:19)
what (48:20 - 48:24)
how why what what are you doing (48:21 - 48:26)
there are a lot of options too there are (48:24 - 48:29)
15 different options I'll wait 20. 20 (48:26 - 48:30)
because there are gold ones because (48:29 - 48:32)
there's gold ones (48:30 - 48:36)
there are 15 different they say silver (48:32 - 48:38)
Prismatic rainbow glitter foil with (48:36 - 48:41)
silver metallic paint plus five special (48:38 - 48:44)
gold foil Edition variants with black (48:41 - 48:47)
and metallic gold ink over gold metallic (48:44 - 48:50)
foil (48:47 - 48:50)
uh (48:58 - 49:00)
uh you know I (49:02 - 49:06)
okay am I (49:06 - 49:10)
am I just not smart (49:10 - 49:14)
because they say eight inch random (49:12 - 49:17)
skateboards in blind bags are there two (49:14 - 49:19)
skateboards here are there little (49:17 - 49:21)
skateboards in blind bags and then are (49:19 - 49:26)
there big actual usable skateboards (49:21 - 49:27)
because (49:26 - 49:32)
like eight inches pretty tiny somebody (49:27 - 49:34)
on my wall right now I can tell you that (49:32 - 49:36)
they're not eight inches I mean what's (49:34 - 49:38)
the standard measurement for skateboards (49:36 - 49:40)
is it the way they are across or the (49:38 - 49:42)
length (49:40 - 49:45)
are we measuring skateboards like the (49:42 - 49:47)
whiff (49:45 - 49:49)
like that's why I'm like am I not smart (49:47 - 49:51)
as somebody who used to skateboard I (49:49 - 49:53)
don't remember that someone holding up a (49:51 - 49:55)
full-size one so (49:53 - 49:57)
yeah that's what I'm saying I'm like (49:55 - 49:59)
looking at pictures and I'm like yeah (49:57 - 50:01)
that's a full-size skateboard and then (49:59 - 50:03)
I'm reading it and it says each blind (50:01 - 50:06)
bag is eight inch random assorted (50:03 - 50:08)
skateboard I'm like eight inches is very (50:06 - 50:10)
that's like a (50:08 - 50:16)
so I've I've gone on to some (50:10 - 50:16)
website and the writing styles are (50:16 - 50:22)
listed by (50:20 - 50:23)
Deck with (50:22 - 50:25)
yeah so the rest of the Santa Cruz (50:23 - 50:28)
website is too seven to seven and a half (50:25 - 50:31)
is narrow seven half to eight is medium (50:28 - 50:34)
eight to eight and a half is ideal for (50:31 - 50:36)
Street transition terrain and eight and (50:34 - 50:38)
a half and up our wider decks great for (50:36 - 50:41)
transition skating bigger Street tricks (50:38 - 50:46)
pools and just cruising so yeah yes I've (50:41 - 50:49)
never I've owned like six skateboards in (50:46 - 50:53)
my life from like 13 to 18 and I don't (50:49 - 50:55)
own any skateboards anymore (50:53 - 50:56)
um (50:55 - 50:58)
except the ones on your wall except the (50:56 - 51:00)
ones on the wall that's true uh I've (50:58 - 51:04)
never heard people measuring it by width (51:00 - 51:07)
I mean I'm not doubting it obviously I (51:04 - 51:09)
just never heard like I would just walk (51:07 - 51:11)
into a skate shop and be like that's the (51:09 - 51:12)
one with the pictures the one I want (51:11 - 51:15)
right like (51:12 - 51:17)
I mean the length is the thing that's (51:15 - 51:18)
standard and then the width is the one (51:17 - 51:21)
that varies yeah (51:18 - 51:21)
I mean yeah I'm seeing the pictures of (51:22 - 51:26)
the guy holding the bag the giant blind (51:23 - 51:28)
box bag (51:26 - 51:30)
okay but this is this is backwards to me (51:28 - 51:33)
in in the sense of like (51:30 - 51:35)
I would love to get bear Walker on I've (51:33 - 51:36)
talked to him for a little bit and he (51:35 - 51:38)
said he wants to be on I feel like the (51:36 - 51:40)
first question I would ask him is how (51:38 - 51:42)
many people actually ride your (51:40 - 51:44)
skateboards because I feel like the (51:42 - 51:46)
majority of people buying Pokemon (51:44 - 51:48)
skateboards are hanging them on my wall (51:46 - 51:50)
case in point I have two on my wall (51:48 - 51:51)
right now (51:50 - 51:52)
um (51:51 - 51:55)
and I don't really want to ride them (51:52 - 51:57)
because (51:55 - 51:58)
they're (51:57 - 52:02)
250 dollars one was a gift one I (51:58 - 52:03)
purchased with my own money before I got (52:02 - 52:05)
the gift because I really genuinely (52:03 - 52:07)
wanted to know the quality of the board (52:05 - 52:09)
but (52:07 - 52:12)
like I I don't know how inflation has (52:09 - 52:15)
hit the skateboard world but you can go (52:12 - 52:18)
to a skateboard shop there's lots of (52:15 - 52:20)
them in Minneapolis and you can get a (52:18 - 52:22)
whole skateboard for like 100 bucks yeah (52:20 - 52:23)
it might not be like (52:22 - 52:26)
the best deck in the entire world but (52:23 - 52:29)
also like if you if you want to get into (52:26 - 52:31)
skateboarding it's a relatively cheap (52:29 - 52:34)
hobby compared to a lot of buying a (52:31 - 52:36)
brand new bikes are very expensive bikes (52:34 - 52:38)
are very so like (52:36 - 52:41)
no one is buying well I shouldn't say no (52:38 - 52:42)
one there's probably somebody listening (52:41 - 52:45)
to podcast no one is buying a 250 bear (52:42 - 52:47)
Walker skateboard to be like yep I'm get (52:45 - 52:50)
this is my this is my this is my in this (52:47 - 52:54)
is not commit to work this is how this (52:50 - 52:57)
I'll get into my nine to five job every (52:54 - 53:00)
day on this Fair one okay so okay so (52:57 - 53:02)
you're paying 250 you're getting exactly (53:00 - 53:04)
what you want bear Walker and then (53:02 - 53:07)
you're probably putting it on your wall (53:04 - 53:10)
this is an actual like (53:07 - 53:13)
traditional skateboard it has the tail (53:10 - 53:17)
it has the nose uh (53:13 - 53:19)
uh it has the eight inches which (53:17 - 53:21)
apparently is what the standard I guess (53:19 - 53:23)
bear Walker these bear Walker (53:21 - 53:26)
skateboards look like nine inches wide (53:23 - 53:29)
but you don't get to pick because it's (53:26 - 53:33)
blind box and then which is like um fine (53:29 - 53:35)
I guess like I would love to just be (53:33 - 53:37)
like I would like to Mewtwo skateboards (53:35 - 53:40)
one for my wall one to actually like (53:37 - 53:42)
skateboard because that would be cool (53:40 - 53:44)
it's like to like in my head I'm like (53:42 - 53:47)
thinking of like do I like skateboards I (53:44 - 53:50)
would like one to keep and then I would (53:47 - 53:52)
like one to ride (53:50 - 53:54)
but you don't get the choice it's it's (53:52 - 53:56)
blind bag and then on top of that (53:54 - 53:58)
they're they're doing five there's an (53:56 - 54:01)
Eevee a Gyarados a Charizard and Pikachu (53:58 - 54:05)
and a mimikyu that are gold which again (54:01 - 54:06)
cool (54:05 - 54:09)
that but but you you've just destroyed (54:06 - 54:11)
the market right there's not somebody (54:09 - 54:14)
who's not gonna sit on September 13th (54:11 - 54:17)
let me double check here September 13th (54:14 - 54:20)
at 9am EST that isn't (54:17 - 54:22)
going to try to buy as many as possible (54:20 - 54:24)
to then put them up on eBay right like (54:22 - 54:26)
yep (54:24 - 54:29)
like so I can't so the actual skateboard (54:26 - 54:31)
that you would maybe want to do that do (54:29 - 54:32)
they have prices here do we don't have (54:31 - 54:36)
prices now I am hunting everywhere for (54:32 - 54:38)
our price there are all the other boards (54:36 - 54:40)
all the other boards on their website (54:38 - 54:43)
are between 60 and 110 yeah because (54:40 - 54:45)
that's how much a skateboard deck should (54:43 - 54:46)
be (54:45 - 54:48)
now that's just the deck to be fair that (54:46 - 54:51)
that is a normal price for a deck so I'm (54:48 - 54:53)
sure there's like some Pokemon tax here (54:51 - 54:54)
like I feel like the cheapest deck I (54:53 - 54:57)
ever bought was like 60 bucks (54:54 - 54:58)
um and then when you buy trucks and you (54:57 - 55:00)
buy wheels and bearings it usually is (54:58 - 55:02)
about 100 120. (55:00 - 55:05)
um but also like your trucks (55:02 - 55:08)
will last longer than like seven boards (55:05 - 55:09)
like your trucks are gonna last forever (55:08 - 55:10)
the only things you're probably (55:09 - 55:13)
replacing are wheels and bearings at (55:10 - 55:16)
that point so like besides the board the (55:13 - 55:17)
trucks are going to be the most (55:16 - 55:20)
expensive trucks are probably like 40 35 (55:17 - 55:22)
to four I don't mean again I haven't (55:20 - 55:24)
bought a skateboard in like 10 years (55:22 - 55:26)
um but your trucks will last forever (55:24 - 55:29)
uh for the most part (55:26 - 55:29)
there's no way these aren't like 100 (55:32 - 55:37)
bucks blind box right (55:33 - 55:37)
I would guess at least (55:38 - 55:42)
yeah I would probably say Pokemon tax (55:39 - 55:44)
given a blind (55:42 - 55:47)
bag is gonna be a hundred dollars (55:44 - 55:49)
I would be surprised if it was lower (55:47 - 55:54)
because they know they can charge that (55:49 - 55:54)
I mean so they have they have Charmander (55:55 - 56:01)
Charmeleon Charizard Squirtle Wartortle (55:58 - 56:05)
Blastoise Bulbasaur Ivysaur Venusaur and (56:01 - 56:09)
then Pikachu Mewtwo Magikarp (56:05 - 56:11)
and then (56:09 - 56:15)
Mew and Gengar (56:11 - 56:17)
and I think that's all 20. (56:15 - 56:19)
yeah (56:17 - 56:21)
so Gyarados and (56:19 - 56:24)
mimikyu are only or an Evie are only (56:21 - 56:26)
gold and then Pikachu and Charizard are (56:24 - 56:28)
gold which that makes sense (56:26 - 56:30)
um like I want like I'm looking at these (56:28 - 56:32)
and I I would legit (56:30 - 56:34)
want to buy like I think the Mewtwo one (56:32 - 56:35)
looks sick I think the Pikachu one looks (56:34 - 56:37)
sick I think if I opened up the Ivysaur (56:35 - 56:41)
I'd be like where's my eBay profile (56:37 - 56:44)
I don't want Ivysaur like I'll take (56:41 - 56:46)
Bulbasaur I'll take Venusaur but like I (56:44 - 56:46)
don't (56:46 - 56:48)
I don't care about either sir I don't (56:46 - 56:51)
care about Charmeleon like I I would if (56:48 - 56:52)
I opened up Charizard I'd be like well (56:51 - 56:53)
that's going straight to eBay and I'll (56:52 - 56:54)
just buy another one because like I know (56:53 - 56:57)
the Charizard one is going to probably (56:54 - 56:58)
be the (56:57 - 57:01)
the best-selling one besides Mewtwo and (56:58 - 57:03)
the gold ones (57:01 - 57:05)
the magic cardboard looks tight is it is (57:03 - 57:07)
that also Snorlax did we say there's a (57:05 - 57:10)
Snorlax it looks like this is Snorlax (57:07 - 57:11)
I'm looking at I'm trying to look at (57:10 - 57:15)
though there is a Snorlax yeah yeah (57:11 - 57:15)
I wouldn't want Snorlax either like I (57:16 - 57:20)
get enough Snorlax in Pokemon sleep yeah (57:17 - 57:26)
like like these boards look so good yeah (57:20 - 57:28)
I love the way they look (57:26 - 57:31)
I'm so into them (57:28 - 57:31)
but there's no way they also they're (57:32 - 57:35)
doing like clothing too like there's (57:34 - 57:38)
like four shirts there's like two (57:35 - 57:41)
hoodies there's a hat I I love this (57:38 - 57:42)
entire collection (57:41 - 57:46)
no way it's not sold out in in seconds (57:42 - 57:46)
so what is Pokemon (57:51 - 57:53)
huge crossover between Pokemon fans and (57:53 - 57:59)
skateboards there's nothing I really (57:56 - 58:00)
want in this apparel collection I think (57:59 - 58:03)
it's fine but (58:00 - 58:05)
there's nothing in here that I (58:03 - 58:08)
really want also I have a sort of thing (58:05 - 58:11)
where I don't want the main (58:08 - 58:15)
focus of the shirt to be Santa Cruz yeah (58:11 - 58:16)
it's the thing that they do with any (58:15 - 58:18)
crossover it's the brand they're (58:16 - 58:19)
crossing over with with the Pokemon (58:18 - 58:21)
slapped on top of it yeah this is not (58:19 - 58:24)
thrilling to me (58:21 - 58:26)
I mean I will say that the the Bulbasaur (58:24 - 58:30)
the Bulbasaur one is cute but again it (58:26 - 58:32)
the thing that takes me out of it is the (58:30 - 58:34)
Santa Cruz part (58:32 - 58:38)
Santa Cruz is a really respectable (58:34 - 58:40)
Skateboarding company and they have made (58:38 - 58:42)
their logo (58:40 - 58:44)
look different (58:42 - 58:45)
on the different shirts like the (58:44 - 58:47)
Charmander one the logos on fire that's (58:45 - 58:50)
kind of neat (58:47 - 58:50)
the Bulbasaur one is really good I'm (58:50 - 58:55)
curious (58:53 - 58:58)
if if a certain selection of these are (58:55 - 59:00)

until the next DLC so I I got (65:28 - 65:33)

I will be there as soon as possible (65:41 - 65:45)
please sign me up (65:47 - 65:53)
um they haven't said anything else about (65:51 - 65:56)
the DLC though uh besides the the very (65:53 - 65:58)
vague (65:56 - 66:00)
uh you know we're just we're just making (65:58 - 66:03)
up times (66:00 - 66:03)
um (66:03 - 66:06)
that I mean social media seems to be (66:04 - 66:09)
doing countdown stuff which is cool (66:06 - 66:12)
but (66:09 - 66:12)
um (66:14 - 66:16)
yeah nothing uh nothing else really (66:17 - 66:22)
I don't know I'm excited (66:23 - 66:30)
as excited as we can be yeah I mean (66:25 - 66:30)
I had sort of Forgotten because like the (66:30 - 66:37)
last between Dragon Con getting home (66:34 - 66:39)
doing a bunch of interviews just I like (66:37 - 66:43)
lost all track of time and then I was (66:39 - 66:44)
looking at something and it's like the (66:43 - 66:48)
DLC is this week I'm like (66:44 - 66:51)
are we already in September (66:48 - 66:51)
no it feels like October because of how (66:52 - 66:57)
early they've just pushed up Halloween (66:55 - 67:00)
stuff I'm okay with that the Halloween (66:57 - 67:03)
stuff is all over it's great I went to (67:00 - 67:06)
Target and the Halloween section is not (67:03 - 67:08)
yet up (67:06 - 67:09)
wait which one did you go to because I (67:08 - 67:11)
was there yesterday and they definitely (67:09 - 67:14)
had it oh they definitely had mine up no (67:11 - 67:16)
they didn't have they were still packing (67:14 - 67:18)
up I mean again the Northeast one is (67:16 - 67:20)
where all the college students (67:18 - 67:22)
go so they sell out all the school (67:20 - 67:25)
supply section up oh (67:22 - 67:26)
which has to be taken down for the (67:25 - 67:28)
Halloween stuff I I was expecting that (67:26 - 67:29)
they're already done like oh yeah well (67:28 - 67:31)
school just technically started because (67:29 - 67:35)
usually the use starts after Labor Day (67:31 - 67:36)
um (67:35 - 67:38)
but they did have some cute new (67:36 - 67:40)
Halloween plates that I almost bought (67:38 - 67:43)
but I didn't because I don't have a job (67:40 - 67:45)
that's a circle back to the ash goodbye (67:43 - 67:47)
thing but (67:45 - 67:50)
but the Pokemon company in the US has (67:47 - 67:53)
advertised their Halloween collection in (67:50 - 67:56)
September better than Ash retiring I (67:53 - 67:59)
just want to say that like (67:56 - 68:01)
like this is why I think it's Halloween (67:59 - 68:02)
because every time I go to (68:01 - 68:03)
pokemoncenter.com or every time I log (68:02 - 68:05)
into Twitter they're showing off some (68:03 - 68:08)
spooky thing that's happening are you (68:05 - 68:11)
gonna buy it that's no discredit to the (68:08 - 68:13)
Halloween stuff it looks cool I'm just (68:11 - 68:16)
saying I need to buy the new cheap resin (68:13 - 68:19)
statues no I've not fallen for the uh (68:16 - 68:23)
the resin thing I will say I am very (68:19 - 68:25)
tempted by the mimikyu spooky (68:23 - 68:27)
celebration ceramic treat Bowl because (68:25 - 68:30)
it's really cute I have one of those I (68:27 - 68:32)
think if I'm looking at the same thing (68:30 - 68:34)
because there's a Snorlax one this year (68:32 - 68:37)
I have a Gengar one it's really really (68:34 - 68:39)
nice the pumpkin (68:38 - 68:41)
oh wait no I yeah I have the pumpkin I (68:39 - 68:44)
don't have a treat Bowl (68:41 - 68:47)
um I do also like the Trevenant Forest (68:44 - 68:50)
Curts wall art I think that's really (68:47 - 68:53)
really cute (68:50 - 68:54)
um (68:53 - 68:58)
there's a Spinda statue a garden statue (68:54 - 69:01)
for Halloween which the only way you (68:58 - 69:02)
could tell it's Halloween is because (69:01 - 69:04)
there's two pieces of candy at its feet (69:02 - 69:06)
which is like (69:04 - 69:08)
that's lazy (69:06 - 69:12)
there are they've done garden statues (69:08 - 69:13)
before I think I have a miraculous one (69:12 - 69:17)
that I ordered when they did like a (69:13 - 69:19)
garden statues for the garden actually (69:17 - 69:23)
not for the Halloween and they're like (69:19 - 69:25)
they're big (69:23 - 69:26)
and (69:25 - 69:28)
but they're not I don't feel like (69:26 - 69:30)
they're big enough to put in your yard (69:28 - 69:33)
and you could see from the road (69:30 - 69:34)
um (69:33 - 69:38)
it is mostly just for you yeah yeah but (69:34 - 69:41)
also when you say Garden (69:38 - 69:43)
I mean maybe that's your backyard garden (69:41 - 69:45)
I wouldn't put it out in my yard because (69:43 - 69:47)
there's no way that's not getting stolen (69:45 - 69:49)
right (69:47 - 69:52)
right it depends on where I'm sure that (69:49 - 69:54)
some of these are made to just go in (69:52 - 69:56)
plant pots or something (69:54 - 69:58)
just go up (69:56 - 70:00)
right next to a good flower you have (69:58 - 70:03)
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and and for (70:00 - 70:05)
this specifically would be fun for kids (70:03 - 70:09)
to see coming up for trick-or-treating (70:05 - 70:09)
some of the Halloween like (70:10 - 70:14)
art made into t-shirts is very tempting (70:12 - 70:16)
like I really do like the turbulence (70:14 - 70:17)
curse (70:16 - 70:19)
uh (70:17 - 70:20)
uh hoodless sweatshirt one with the (70:19 - 70:22)
Trevenant with the not the prevident (70:20 - 70:25)
what's the pre Evo called which Phantom (70:22 - 70:28)
uh on the front I think that's really (70:25 - 70:30)
cute the only problem is is that I know (70:28 - 70:34)
how thick and finally that paint is on (70:30 - 70:37)
the back of that oh (70:34 - 70:39)
like you know that that is thick and (70:37 - 70:41)
crispy and it's going to take a while (70:39 - 70:44)
for that to sort of crack but it's cute (70:41 - 70:47)
I mean again I don't know if I would pay (70:44 - 70:51)
sixty dollars for it but (70:47 - 70:51)
wait but the t-shirt's only 25. yeah the (70:51 - 70:56)
long sleeve sweatshirts because it's (70:54 - 70:59)
Folly it's folly 60. (70:56 - 71:01)
um which is what I would do because I (70:59 - 71:02)
have plenty of t-shirts and I don't have (71:01 - 71:04)
enough long sleeve shirts I actually (71:02 - 71:06)
liked the shirts without the thing on (71:04 - 71:09)
the back I kind of just liked the (71:06 - 71:12)
the black embroidered Pokemon on the (71:09 - 71:15)
front yeah and then I like turned it (71:12 - 71:17)
over and I was like oh never mind I'm (71:15 - 71:21)
out yeah I don't want to have my back (71:17 - 71:24)
it reminded me of like wrestling shirts (71:21 - 71:27)
like some like most wrestling shirts are (71:24 - 71:29)
so terribly designed and sometimes (71:27 - 71:31)
they'll get the front right and you're (71:29 - 71:32)
like wow that's like a decent wrestling (71:31 - 71:34)
shirt and then you like turn it around (71:32 - 71:36)
you're like oh nope never mind you like (71:34 - 71:38)
right in the back yeah yeah the whole (71:36 - 71:41)
back has something I didn't ask for (71:38 - 71:44)
you just gotta wear a backpack with it (71:41 - 71:46)
all the time all the time permanent (71:44 - 71:49)
backpack (71:46 - 71:49)
uh all right like I said (71:49 - 71:55)
um uh uh I will be streaming the DLC (71:51 - 71:58)
come on Wednesday although if it does (71:55 - 72:01)
come out somewhat Tuesday night I don't (71:58 - 72:04)
know I'll probably just like (72:01 - 72:06)
not play it and just wait till Wednesday (72:04 - 72:08)
so (72:06 - 72:09)
um (72:08 - 72:11)
you know there's always that tough (72:09 - 72:12)
balance with streaming because people (72:11 - 72:13)
want to see you stream but also people (72:12 - 72:15)
don't want to be spoiled so that's why I (72:13 - 72:16)
always like (72:15 - 72:17)
hey if it comes out at midnight I'll (72:16 - 72:19)
just start the next day that way you (72:17 - 72:21)
guys can do your thing at midnight (72:19 - 72:23)
experience it and then you don't have to (72:21 - 72:25)
worry about like me taking away that (72:23 - 72:28)
first couple moments of whatever I don't (72:25 - 72:31)
who even knows it's probably like here's (72:28 - 72:33)
your new outfit that you're stuck with (72:31 - 72:36)
for the next 20 hours and you know what (72:33 - 72:39)
if I get you change my outfit to not be (72:36 - 72:42)

beyond happy you heard it here first 10 (72:42 - 72:48)
out of 10 from Greg no more slow uniform (72:45 - 72:50)
this never moving above a zero unless (72:48 - 72:53)
they make one edition so (72:50 - 72:55)
