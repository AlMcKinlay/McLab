packing that I don&#39;t I don&#39;t here&#39;s my (0:46 - 0:51)
thing I (0:50 - 0:54)
don&#39;t (0:51 - 0:59)
understand what is hard or stressful (0:54 - 1:01)
about packing (0:59 - 1:02)
I don&#39;t I don&#39;t think it&#39;s hard or (1:01 - 1:04)
stress I think maybe the well I don&#39;t (1:02 - 1:05)
think it&#39;s hard I think maybe the stress (1:04 - 1:08)
comes from forgetting something yeah but (1:05 - 1:10)
I live when you know what you want to (1:08 - 1:12)
bring and you can&#39;t find it last minute (1:10 - 1:15)
that&#39;s where the issues lie here&#39;s my (1:12 - 1:18)
thing I know I&#39;m going to another (1:15 - 1:20)
American city that has (1:18 - 1:23)
stores yes but you (1:20 - 1:25)
yes but (1:23 - 1:28)
money if I&#39;m taking an expensive (1:25 - 1:30)
vacation I&#39;m already in the hole I&#39;m (1:28 - 1:33)
just not gonna stress here&#39;s the the one (1:30 - 1:35)
thing I&#39;m worried about is what I&#39;m (1:33 - 1:38)
gonna do about my I have a big tube of (1:35 - 1:42)
sunscreen tube and I want to bring my (1:38 - 1:44)
big tube of sunscreen but I don&#39;t want (1:42 - 1:47)
to be stopped because I have a carry on (1:44 - 1:48)
to say what&#39;s your big tup of (1:47 - 1:51)
sunscreen so I&#39;m debating what I&#39;m going (1:48 - 1:54)
to do about my sunscreen situation if (1:51 - 1:56)
I&#39;m going to try to get a smaller one or (1:54 - 1:58)
I&#39;m just GNA risk it and say look at (1:56 - 2:00)
sunscreen what do you want from me I I (1:58 - 2:02)
don&#39;t have this problem CU I have to (2:00 - 2:06)
live the checked lifestyle because my (2:02 - 2:11)
stream backpack takes up my carryon and (2:06 - 2:12)
then I need my other backpack for my (2:11 - 2:15)
computer yeah so I have to I always it (2:12 - 2:17)
just sucks I have to always check you (2:15 - 2:19)
still want to make sure the sunscreen (2:17 - 2:20)
isn&#39;t going to explode all over your (2:19 - 2:23)
back though oh yeah I mean I put it in (2:20 - 2:24)
Ziploc (2:23 - 2:28)
peggies my dream every time this is my (2:24 - 2:31)
personal travel win is when I get to the (2:28 - 2:33)
gate and they&#39;re like well check your (2:31 - 2:35)
bag for (2:33 - 2:39)
free I&#39;m in take it take it and have it (2:35 - 2:41)
waiting for me at the top of the jet (2:39 - 2:44)
when I come back this is this is the (2:41 - 2:46)
greatest moment of my travel time I (2:44 - 2:47)
don&#39;t have to worry about it I&#39;m just G (2:46 - 2:50)
to take my phone and my iPad out and you (2:47 - 2:53)

I&#39;ll just pick it up when I leave I (2:53 - 2:56)
don&#39;t (2:55 - 3:01)
ever fear of my checked bag getting lost (2:56 - 3:05)
or damaged because it&#39;s just (3:01 - 3:05)
clothes and I probably could use less (3:05 - 3:10)
clothes it&#39;s fine you can (3:08 - 3:13)
do or like stolen like what are you (3:10 - 3:14)
going to do steal my dirty laundry on (3:13 - 3:16)

have to bring theater clothes I have to (3:19 - 3:23)
bring like long pants and a better set (3:21 - 3:27)
of shoes because I plan on wearing prob (3:23 - 3:29)
it&#39;s going to be hot so I&#39;m not going to (3:27 - 3:31)
be wearing much more than t-shirt (3:29 - 3:33)
possibly a tank top and shorts and I&#39;m (3:31 - 3:35)
not going to the theater in a tank top (3:33 - 3:38)
and shorts so I do need to bring better (3:35 - 3:41)
shoes and pants and go to the theater in (3:38 - 3:43)

supposedly going to rain supposed to (3:43 - 3:47)
rain to rain yeah on Saturday it&#39;s also (3:45 - 3:49)
rain on Friday and Saturday but like the (3:47 - 3:51)
chances are (3:49 - 3:55)
like low that it&#39;ll hit that area so (3:51 - 3:58)
whatever uh well speaking of Niantic (3:55 - 3:59)
well we&#39;ll get to that later uh let&#39;s (3:58 - 4:03)
start off with Pokemon sleep (3:59 - 4:06)
uh we did not talk about this last week (4:03 - 4:08)
but uh this was last week&#39;s news uh (4:06 - 4:12)
Pokemon sleep has reached 20 million (4:08 - 4:15)
downloads worldwide and to celebrate (4:12 - 4:18)
they gave out a th000 sleep points one (4:15 - 4:22)
main skill seed one dream cluster medium (4:18 - 4:25)
and five Pokey biscuits uh all you have (4:22 - 4:26)

from now till August 25th if you log in (4:32 - 4:36)
you get all those (4:34 - 4:38)
items and they also say here that (4:36 - 4:41)
Pokemon sleep was released on IOS and (4:38 - 4:43)
Android in Late July (4:41 - 4:47)
2023 so I would expect in the next week (4:43 - 4:50)
or so that we will probably get details (4:47 - 4:54)
for the oneye celebrate this is not a (4:50 - 4:56)
oneyear celebration gift this is the (4:54 - 4:58)
this is just a download gift yeah this (4:56 - 5:00)
is the download gift although going back (4:58 - 5:03)
to the Niantic thing and I said this on (5:00 - 5:06)
Twitter and I will beat this drum until (5:03 - 5:07)
it&#39;s (5:06 - 5:10)
broken this is an amazing gift for (5:07 - 5:13)
literally nothing they are giving you (5:10 - 5:17)
the best item in the game for free just (5:13 - 5:20)
because they reached this Milestone if (5:17 - 5:22)
this was Niantic and they were like we (5:20 - 5:23)
reached 50 million downloads they would (5:22 - 5:27)
be like here&#39;s three na berries and four (5:23 - 5:29)
pokeballs thanks for playing our game I (5:27 - 5:30)
just (5:29 - 5:32)
I just don&#39;t understand now that there (5:30 - 5:34)
are other Pokemon well Pokemon cafe (5:32 - 5:36)
remix that doesn&#39;t count because they (5:34 - 5:39)
are so greedy and that department but (5:36 - 5:43)
like Masters or un well maybe unite (5:39 - 5:44)
doesn&#39;t count either Masters or sleep (5:43 - 5:46)
let&#39;s look at those two they are so (5:44 - 5:50)
generous to their players (5:46 - 5:54)
and just install such good will that I (5:50 - 5:56)
don&#39;t understand what Niantic is doing (5:54 - 5:58)
Niantic could be like for our eth (5:56 - 6:01)
anniversary and everyone gets three (5:58 - 6:04)
super incubators you know how good like (6:01 - 6:07)
that costs them nothing mhm mhm that&#39;s (6:04 - 6:11)
like $6 in like in-game currency but (6:07 - 6:12)
actually cost them literally nothing cuz (6:11 - 6:15)
it&#39;s a digital item like why can&#39;t they (6:12 - 6:17)
just be generous for (6:15 - 6:17)
once because that&#39;s not the economy they (6:17 - 6:22)
have set up (6:20 - 6:25)
correct also I never know what to do (6:22 - 6:26)
with these I have like this is like my (6:25 - 6:29)
third main skill seed I don&#39;t know what (6:26 - 6:31)
to do with them you you put them into (6:29 - 6:33)
okay so here&#39;s here&#39;s your main skill (6:31 - 6:34)
seed priority (6:33 - 6:37)
order uh energy for everyone so that&#39;s (6:34 - 6:39)
either your Wiggly tough your Sylveon or (6:37 - 6:40)
your (6:39 - 6:43)
gavor and if you don&#39;t have that in my (6:40 - 6:45)
opinion somebody&#39;s going to like write (6:43 - 6:47)
in the comments like gold (6:45 - 6:50)
duck that&#39;s like a don&#39;t ignore that (6:47 - 6:52)
that&#39;s like hardcore players and you (6:50 - 6:54)
need a very specific gold duck to make (6:52 - 6:57)
that happen my second choice if it&#39;s not (6:54 - 7:01)
e for e e for e i for everyone would be (6:57 - 7:02)
like the Kanto (7:01 - 7:06)
starters uh Blastoise Venusaur Charizard (7:02 - 7:07)
if you didn&#39;t know what the Kanto (7:06 - 7:09)
starters were I just named them yeah I (7:07 - 7:11)
had no idea I&#39;ve never played those (7:09 - 7:13)
games not once I&#39;ve never heard of the (7:11 - 7:16)
Kanto reason it&#39;s crazy it&#39;s like a new (7:13 - 7:18)
region uh the new poke yeah the new (7:16 - 7:22)
Pokemon Charizard uh those have uh their (7:18 - 7:24)
ingredient Pokemon and then they&#39;re main (7:22 - 7:25)
skill is ingredient magnet so they get (7:24 - 7:27)
you a lot of ingredients so that what (7:25 - 7:30)
does it actually do it levels up your (7:27 - 7:32)
main skill so for example with like a (7:30 - 7:35)
wiggly tough it energy for everyone (7:32 - 7:37)
would be at like a main skill one it (7:35 - 7:39)
would be six energy to everyone but if (7:37 - 7:41)
it was main skill two it would be like (7:39 - 7:42)
10 energy to everyone and if it was main (7:41 - 7:44)
skill three it would be like 14 energy (7:42 - 7:47)
to everyone so it&#39;s increasing that (7:44 - 7:48)
skill (7:47 - 7:50)
permanently so my Wiggly tff is main (7:48 - 7:54)
skill six so when it procs it&#39;s 18 to (7:50 - 7:57)
everyone which is very very good cuz you (7:54 - 8:00)
lose how much energy do you lose an hour (7:57 - 8:01)
or two an hour or something like that (8:00 - 8:03)
something like that so you get you get (8:01 - 8:05)
that back and a Pokemon will perform (8:03 - 8:10)
better when it&#39;s over 100% it can go up (8:05 - 8:12)
to 150% so Snorlax can only get you to (8:10 - 8:14)
100 but at the start of the day if (8:12 - 8:17)
Wiggly tough procs and gives everyone 18 (8:14 - 8:19)
now your all your Pokemon are at (8:17 - 8:22)
118% for the day and then obviously that (8:19 - 8:25)
can stack if Wiggly tough procs have you (8:22 - 8:26)
put every single one of your main skill (8:25 - 8:30)
seeds into Wigglytuff (8:26 - 8:30)
uh I did three (8:30 - 8:37)
cuz iggly to jiggly to Wiggly is three (8:33 - 8:39)
yeah and then another three is six and (8:37 - 8:41)
you can&#39;t go higher than six some (8:39 - 8:44)
Pokemon can go to seven yeah like okay (8:41 - 8:45)
Golduck can go to (8:44 - 8:49)
seven otherwise my blast ways is at six (8:45 - 8:50)
my Charizard&#39;s at (8:49 - 8:52)
four those are good too that just means (8:50 - 8:54)
you get more ingredients for those those (8:52 - 8:56)
you&#39;ll just get more ingredients when it (8:54 - 8:58)
when it (8:56 - 9:00)
activates if you don&#39;t I know what to do (8:58 - 9:02)
with them they&#39;re very (9:00 - 9:04)
good they&#39;re good they&#39;re (9:02 - 9:07)
permanent forever (9:04 - 9:09)
changed they&#39;re permanent until this (9:07 - 9:12)
game goes down the or until you find a (9:09 - 9:15)
better Pokemon of that kind which is the (9:12 - 9:17)
issue you want to make sure you&#39;re using (9:15 - 9:20)
these skill seeds on a good Pokemon (9:17 - 9:22)
right like make sure you have (9:20 - 9:27)
like an A A minus A+ Pokemon in your in (9:22 - 9:31)
your head in your head yes (9:27 - 9:34)
[Laughter] (9:31 - 9:35)
uh the other thing they announced is (9:34 - 9:38)
there will be a trial bundle Volume 2 (9:35 - 9:40)
which is filled with items and diamonds (9:38 - 9:43)
that will be available on July 9th (9:40 - 9:45)
unlike usual bundles that are exchanged (9:43 - 9:48)
for diamonds uh trial bundle two can be (9:45 - 9:51)
purchased directly it is saying that (9:48 - 9:52)
this will come (9:51 - 9:55)
with uh it says prices are dependent on (9:52 - 9:57)
your currency and your region so that&#39;s (9:55 - 9:59)
why they don&#39;t have them listed here but (9:57 - 10:01)
they&#39;re saying it could contains 150 (9:59 - 10:05)
paid diamonds 350 bonus diamonds no clue (10:01 - 10:07)
what the paid and bonus means they&#39;ve (10:05 - 10:09)
done this before and they&#39;ve never (10:07 - 10:12)
clarified uh 10 Pokey biscuits and then (10:09 - 10:15)
one one good camp (10:12 - 10:18)
ticket if I was to guess the bundle is (10:15 - 10:20)
going to (10:18 - 10:23)
cost whatever 150 diamonds is and then (10:20 - 10:26)
everything else is extra which I think (10:23 - 10:28)
is (10:26 - 10:31)
$2.99 that would be wild which is a (10:28 - 10:34)
really good deal because good cam ticket (10:31 - 10:38)
on its own is $10 te Tech techn in the (10:34 - 10:39)
US at (10:38 - 10:42)
least yeah just based off the value of (10:39 - 10:44)
all the items in there I was guessing (10:42 - 10:46)
maybe it would be $5 if it was any less (10:44 - 10:48)
than that that would be incredible $5 is (10:46 - 10:51)
still a good deal it was probably $5 for (10:48 - 10:55)
they like their $4.99 in Pokemon (10:51 - 10:55)
games and you can only get (10:55 - 11:01)
one and (10:58 - 11:03)
it says that will be available from July (11:01 - 11:11)
9th to February 25th 2025 so no no rush (11:03 - 11:13)
that yeah I (11:11 - 11:16)
think I I remember almost everyone (11:13 - 11:18)
getting everyone on the show getting the (11:16 - 11:20)
first trial bundle because it was such a (11:18 - 11:21)
good (11:20 - 11:24)
deal the only thing I&#39;ve paid for in (11:21 - 11:26)
this (11:24 - 11:26)
app they do really gets you addicted to (11:28 - 11:32)
those good cam tickets I&#39;ve been running (11:30 - 11:36)
this last two weeks without it and yeah (11:32 - 11:39)
your pot just isn&#39;t as big you&#39;re you&#39;re (11:36 - 11:41)
you&#39;re not getting as many bar they (11:39 - 11:43)
really it&#39;s a really good item but it&#39;s (11:41 - 11:46)
so I can&#39;t imagine spending $10 a week (11:43 - 11:49)
on it nope that&#39;s that&#39;s crazy I I have (11:46 - 11:51)
not used a good camp ticket I don&#39;t (11:49 - 11:54)
think except for like for the one event (11:51 - 11:57)
I don&#39;t remember ente or or REO or (11:54 - 12:00)
something I think it was (11:57 - 12:04)
the back okay (12:00 - 12:07)
yeah yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s super I look I wish (12:04 - 12:11)

cuz the Rebrand was what a year later a (14:56 - 15:01)
year later yeah so 2021 I mean (14:58 - 15:03)
technically Masters did that too it was (15:01 - 15:04)
Masters for a year and then it was (15:03 - 15:07)
Masters ex just yeah do we know why they (15:04 - 15:12)
did these rebrands I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t (15:07 - 15:17)
know yeah all right both of them yeah (15:12 - 15:19)
both of them I can&#39;t wait for Pokemon (15:17 - 15:22)
unite (15:19 - 15:22)

frame Victini is cooking uh bikini in a (15:44 - 15:51)
cooking king outfit may (15:47 - 15:53)

bingo (15:58 - 16:03)
and then there was oh wait there&#39;s a (16:01 - 16:06)
there&#39;s an evil team in the game called (16:03 - 16:10)
team crunch this is hold on I think I&#39;m (16:06 - 16:11)
back this is a turning point at this (16:10 - 16:14)
point now we&#39;re getting into the deep (16:11 - 16:16)
lore you will have an opportunity to (16:14 - 16:19)
earn Metagross to join your sta staff (16:16 - 16:21)

Treats of login bonuses with the fourth (16:21 - 16:25)
anniversary (16:23 - 16:25)
stamps I I don&#39;t know this who&#39;s playing (16:26 - 16:33)
this where are you it seems like a very (16:30 - 16:36)
full game but I don&#39;t know people it&#39;s (16:33 - 16:37)
been going for four years and they&#39;re (16:36 - 16:39)
putting out content maybe I just don&#39;t (16:37 - 16:42)
pay attention to people who play it it&#39;s (16:39 - 16:46)
just it&#39;s just not a good game I feel (16:42 - 16:48)
like the people who would play it and (16:46 - 16:49)
I&#39;m assuming the market they were trying (16:48 - 16:52)
to get would be the Candy Crush Market (16:49 - 16:54)
yeah which is very big it&#39;s a very big (16:52 - 16:58)
super big it&#39;s like why Microsoft wanted (16:54 - 17:00)
Activision Activision (16:58 - 17:03)
wanted whatever King was it King game (17:00 - 17:05)
that had K I think it was (17:03 - 17:07)
King uh it was literally for the Candy (17:05 - 17:09)
Crush players you would think it would (17:07 - 17:11)
have been for the Call of Duty players (17:09 - 17:12)
it was for the Candy Crush players for (17:11 - 17:14)
the Candy Crush players they have lots (17:12 - 17:16)
of money and they&#39;re willing to spend it (17:14 - 17:19)
and and they they they no matter how bad (17:16 - 17:22)
that game is they will continue they (17:19 - 17:24)
will continue playing it and complaining (17:22 - 17:27)
and continue giving it money I would (17:24 - 17:30)
again assume that these that that&#39;s the (17:27 - 17:32)
market they were going (17:30 - 17:34)
for (17:32 - 17:38)
and maybe that&#39;s working and that&#39;s like (17:34 - 17:40)
maybe they got it and maybe they&#39;re just (17:38 - 17:44)
it&#39;s just like silent players like you (17:40 - 17:45)
like I&#39;m sure there&#39;s people that think (17:44 - 17:47)
that about Pokemon sleep of like who&#39;s (17:45 - 17:49)
playing Pokemon sleep yeah I can tell (17:47 - 17:51)
you almost everyone listening to this (17:49 - 17:52)
podcast is playing Pokemon sleep because (17:51 - 17:54)
we talk about it way too (17:52 - 17:57)
much Pokemon sleep is actually a good (17:54 - 17:59)
game though (17:57 - 18:00)
Cafe (17:59 - 18:02)
remix (18:00 - 18:07)
oh I I mean I would like it if more of a (18:02 - 18:12)
matchy like swappy or a Tetris thing (18:07 - 18:17)
instead of a swirly m i that I&#39;m just (18:12 - 18:18)
like I don&#39;t understand what I&#39;m (18:17 - 18:20)
supposed to be doing but don&#39;t people (18:18 - 18:21)
like the and (18:20 - 18:24)
Ranger that&#39;s those those were great (18:21 - 18:27)
Ranger was a fantastic (18:24 - 18:31)
game both have swirlies swirl swirl (18:27 - 18:34)
swirl I know they&#39;re different I&#39;m just (18:31 - 18:36)
what out a style is swirly that you got (18:34 - 18:38)
to go real fast and catch things and (18:36 - 18:40)
once got a let&#39;s kind of connect stuff (18:38 - 18:42)
and maybe things (18:40 - 18:44)
happen what what do you think it would (18:42 - 18:46)
feel better Greg if you had like a (18:44 - 18:51)
stylus for your phone no no it&#39;s just (18:46 - 18:52)
it&#39;s not (18:51 - 18:55)
fun you don&#39;t understand what&#39;s (18:52 - 18:58)
happening when in Pokemon cafe remix (18:55 - 19:01)
there&#39;s no hardcore players do I&#39;m sure (18:58 - 19:03)
I&#39;m sure people who love it know exactly (19:01 - 19:04)
what&#39;s happening and all the tips and (19:03 - 19:07)
tricks and the hot slides and the hot (19:04 - 19:10)
honestly I&#39;m not convinced I still it (19:07 - 19:12)
all just seems (19:10 - 19:16)
random I if I was to play a game like (19:12 - 19:17)
Cafe (19:16 - 19:21)
remix I would probably just play Candy (19:17 - 19:23)
Crush like if like a Candy Crush has it (19:21 - 19:26)
like figured out and they also have (19:23 - 19:28)
millions of players which means like (19:26 - 19:30)
they they&#39;ve created a game that people (19:28 - 19:33)
want to well I don&#39;t know if people want (19:30 - 19:35)
to play if they&#39;re just they just can&#39;t (19:33 - 19:39)
shake this the Candy Crush uh addiction (19:35 - 19:41)
but (19:39 - 19:41)
like the Poke the Pokemon itself the art (19:42 - 19:48)
style is great the Pokemon like the game (19:45 - 19:51)
visually looks good but not even Pokemon (19:48 - 19:54)
can get me to sit for more than five (19:51 - 19:56)
minutes before I&#39;m just like man I wish (19:54 - 19:58)
I was playing something else yeah the (19:56 - 20:00)
art style keeps making me want to go (19:58 - 20:03)
back to the game oh the art style is (20:00 - 20:05)
great but it&#39;s (20:03 - 20:07)
just it&#39;s one of those games where I (20:05 - 20:09)
would almost consider buying merch for (20:07 - 20:11)
it even though I don&#39;t play it because (20:09 - 20:13)
all of the art is (20:11 - 20:16)
incredible agree if you had t-shirts (20:13 - 20:18)
with those little figures on it I would (20:16 - 20:21)
I would consider as long as it nowhere (20:18 - 20:24)
on the shirt did it say Cafe remix as (20:21 - 20:26)
long as (20:24 - 20:29)
be as long as that was hidden or I take (20:26 - 20:32)
it off and it could just be the cute (20:29 - 20:35)
art correct me if I&#39;m wrong because I (20:32 - 20:38)
haven&#39;t played Cafe remix in like two (20:35 - 20:42)
years happy four years um that there&#39;s a (20:38 - 20:44)
time like the whole thing is timer based (20:42 - 20:46)
like you have to like cook and swirl a (20:44 - 20:50)
meal with the timer coming down whereas (20:46 - 20:52)
I feel like in (20:50 - 20:54)
Pokemon (20:52 - 20:57)
Shuffle it was (20:54 - 21:00)
just like switch two positions to like (20:57 - 21:03)
then line them up and the only time (21:00 - 21:04)
where I remember in Shuffle and I could (21:03 - 21:07)
be wrong was like the Sunday meow thing (21:04 - 21:08)
where they did like meow every Sunday (21:07 - 21:10)
and you could like get coins and it was (21:08 - 21:12)
bonuses and that was like a two- minute (21:10 - 21:14)
timer or something I don&#39;t know I guess (21:12 - 21:16)
I would want my puzzle games I&#39;m (21:14 - 21:19)
thinking of like uh picross which there (21:16 - 21:22)
was a Pokemon picross or I&#39;m thinking of (21:19 - 21:23)
like (21:22 - 21:26)
sidoku or I&#39;m thinking of like Professor (21:23 - 21:29)
Leighton I don&#39;t want a timer I want to (21:26 - 21:31)
like sit there and like the puzzle part (21:29 - 21:33)
I like the puzzle part I like puzzle (21:31 - 21:36)
games but I don&#39;t want the stress of a (21:33 - 21:37)
timer I don&#39;t think that makes the (21:36 - 21:40)
puzzle game more fun to me I (21:37 - 21:43)
think it can it really depends on the (21:40 - 21:45)
type of game yeah I&#39;ve been playing a (21:43 - 21:47)
lot of Tetris and there&#39;s definitely a (21:45 - 21:51)
Time based element to that just as the (21:47 - 21:52)
blocks fall down and everything I think (21:51 - 21:54)
there&#39;s a Tim or too (21:52 - 21:57)
but oh you got to play endless Tetris (21:54 - 21:59)
you just play until you just play until (21:57 - 22:02)
blow up the the normal one already has (21:59 - 22:04)
enough ads my guess is endless Tetris (22:02 - 22:07)
has endless ads (22:04 - 22:10)
yeah how many acorns would you like to (22:07 - 22:13)
buy that&#39;s the currency in Cafe remix is (22:10 - 22:15)
acorns and that&#39;s how that&#39;s why I feel (22:13 - 22:17)
like the game&#39;s (22:15 - 22:20)
dying I mean clearly not it&#39;s been (22:17 - 22:21)
around for four years they&#39;re having a (22:20 - 22:24)
four year anniversary they are I wonder (22:21 - 22:27)
my my guess would be they once they (22:24 - 22:29)
figure out a better puzzle game (22:27 - 22:31)
because there&#39;s always there&#39;s there (22:29 - 22:33)
always feels like there is a Pokemon (22:31 - 22:36)
Puzzle game there&#39;s always a better game (22:33 - 22:39)
then they Sun they Sunset Cafe remix (22:36 - 22:41)
come out with something else I don&#39;t (22:39 - 22:42)
know what something else would be just (22:41 - 22:45)
make Pokemon Shuffle too yeah that&#39;s the (22:42 - 22:47)
thing why if that&#39;s the case if they are (22:45 - 22:49)
trying to make a better puzzle game in (22:47 - 22:51)
order to Sunset the current one why on (22:49 - 22:53)
Earth would they move from Pokemon (22:51 - 22:55)
Shuffle to Cafe (22:53 - 22:58)
mix that&#39;s that&#39;s not in the positive (22:55 - 23:02)
direction you&#39;re not moving to a better (22:58 - 23:02)
game uh bring back Pokemon duel no (23:02 - 23:08)
Pokemon duel was bad Pokemon du is bad (23:05 - 23:10)
bring back Pokemon (23:08 - 23:13)
Rumble no that was all that Rumble Rush (23:10 - 23:16)
was maybe the worst mobile game no here (23:13 - 23:20)
we go bring back Pokemon Dash no okay (23:16 - 23:23)
that wasn&#39;t a mobile game that was that (23:20 - 23:25)
attitude it could be a mobile game it (23:23 - 23:27)
wasn&#39;t that complicated it you&#39;re right (23:25 - 23:29)
it wasn&#39;t it did it didn&#39;t involve (23:27 - 23:30)
stylist though would it break people&#39;s (23:29 - 23:33)
phones like it broke people&#39;s 3DS&#39;s or (23:30 - 23:36)
DS&#39;s I don&#39;t think the touching the (23:33 - 23:40)
Pikachu to make it move broke the DS&#39;s I (23:36 - 23:43)
think the frustration of the game itself (23:40 - 23:45)
broke I mean what they have all those (23:43 - 23:48)
Temple escapes and whatever these days (23:45 - 23:50)
that&#39;s true there&#39;s never been like a (23:48 - 23:54)
Pokemon Temple Run or Pokemon mystery (23:50 - 23:56)
Temple Escape that&#39;s the next one that (23:54 - 23:58)
they&#39;re working on they need to come out (23:56 - 24:01)
with a Pon Subway Surfers so when I make (23:58 - 24:03)
Tik Tock and I&#39;m talking I can put (24:01 - 24:06)
Subway Pokemon Subway Surfers on the (24:03 - 24:09)
bottom and then I can talk on the top (24:06 - 24:11)
that&#39;s what they that they would really (24:09 - 24:13)
corner you know how they hold on this is (24:11 - 24:16)
actually great they would do so they (24:13 - 24:18)
would do numbers on Tik Tok could you (24:16 - 24:20)
imagine watching like a like a political (24:18 - 24:22)
debate but in order to get your (24:20 - 24:24)
attention there&#39;s like Pikachu running (24:22 - 24:26)
on the bottom because you need like your (24:24 - 24:30)
sludge content (24:26 - 24:30)
quickly becoming a much darker timeline (24:32 - 24:38)
than I wanted to be oh we&#39;re already (24:34 - 24:41)
there yeah I (24:38 - 24:45)
I Subway Surfers was not a thing when I (24:41 - 24:48)
was in like high school college my my (24:45 - 24:51)
game was Temple Run Temple Run was like (24:48 - 24:52)
the original (24:51 - 24:56)
one right yeah I think (24:52 - 24:59)
so that was a middle school high school (24:56 - 25:00)
thing for (24:59 - 25:03)
me I don&#39;t know if there was (25:00 - 25:05)
anything early (25:03 - 25:09)
[Laughter] (25:05 - 25:09)
30s Greg were you not (25:09 - 25:15)
a I did not play (25:12 - 25:17)
them I played a little bit do you (25:15 - 25:20)
remember uh doodle doodle jump or (25:17 - 25:22)
whatever oh yeah I remember that Doodle (25:20 - 25:25)
Jump was good I remember Doodle Jump do (25:22 - 25:27)
you remember like the the beer app on (25:25 - 25:29)
the iPhone when it first came came out (25:27 - 25:33)
and it was just like oh yep yeah one (25:29 - 25:35)
that was like a lighter and it just it (25:33 - 25:38)
just showed a flame the flashlight app (25:35 - 25:40)
that just turned the screen (25:38 - 25:42)
white well you needed that because there (25:40 - 25:46)
wasn&#39;t a flash I know but still bring (25:42 - 25:48)
back the this is just becoming a boomer (25:46 - 25:50)
episode we need to take a (25:48 - 25:53)
break we be the oh the first concert I (25:50 - 25:56)
went to that people held up their phones (25:53 - 25:59)
with the lighter thing on it was dark (25:56 - 26:01)
moment in my (25:59 - 26:04)
life I got news for you Greg it&#39;s only (26:01 - 26:06)
gotten darker (26:04 - 26:10)

right (26:10 - 26:16)
back and we are back from our break Greg (26:11 - 26:17)
the last time you were on you were (26:16 - 26:22)
talking about the possibility of ho oh (26:17 - 26:25)
yes coming to Pokemon unite yes yes yes (26:22 - 26:28)
that that was a real thing it&#39;s real (26:25 - 26:31)
it&#39;s here and it&#39;s broken was not here (26:28 - 26:37)
yet but it&#39;s it&#39;s broken I can&#39;t believe (26:31 - 26:40)
character uh it looks like that it&#39;s an (26:37 - 26:43)
ex Pokemon yeah it&#39;s an ex po so it&#39;s (26:40 - 26:45)
does that give it it&#39;s going to be (26:43 - 26:49)
broken um here so it&#39;s this is (26:45 - 26:51)
the (26:49 - 26:54)
third this the third I think it&#39;s the (26:51 - 26:56)
third third anniversary of unite so it&#39;s (26:54 - 26:58)
the third it&#39;s the night third (26:56 - 27:00)
anniversary (26:58 - 27:02)
ex (27:00 - 27:05)
nightmare uh as typical fashion most (27:02 - 27:06)
likely you&#39;ll be able to get hoo for (27:05 - 27:08)
free by logging in x amount of times and (27:06 - 27:10)
doing their little board game thing (27:08 - 27:11)
where you roll the dice and you always (27:10 - 27:14)
just spend your coins to get a six just (27:11 - 27:16)
that that&#39;s the thing it&#39;s going to say (27:14 - 27:17)
hey do you want to reroll spend (27:16 - 27:20)
coins you will always get a higher (27:17 - 27:22)
number that&#39;s the thing so just spend (27:20 - 27:24)
the coins until you get a six and then (27:22 - 27:25)
you move through the thing faster Greg (27:24 - 27:27)
with the the (27:25 - 27:33)
tips um I have seen gameplay of it on uh (27:27 - 27:34)
the public test server because it&#39;s (27:33 - 27:37)
there right now (27:34 - 27:41)
and I am not looking forward to this (27:37 - 27:42)
next (27:41 - 27:46)
season of Pokemon Unite with this with (27:42 - 27:50)
this thing flying around it it says it&#39;s (27:46 - 27:53)
a Defender it&#39;s a (27:50 - 27:56)
Defender and for I I feel like if you&#39;re (27:53 - 27:58)
if you&#39;re if you&#39;re just a casual player (27:56 - 28:00)
of Pokemon unite which is totally fine I (27:58 - 28:03)
feel like at surface level hoo just kind (28:00 - 28:05)
of looks like a Charizard it has like (28:03 - 28:07)
flamethrower has like fire Spin and (28:05 - 28:09)
you&#39;re like what what does this do (28:07 - 28:11)
differently than (28:09 - 28:13)
Charizard uh well if you&#39;ve ever played (28:11 - 28:15)
the game OverWatch uh there was a (28:13 - 28:18)
character called Mercy which has now (28:15 - 28:20)
been changed dramatically you didn&#39;t (28:18 - 28:24)
think I knew OverWatch lore I do so when (28:20 - 28:26)
so when mercy originally came out in (28:24 - 28:29)
OverWatch her ultimate was to revive the (28:26 - 28:34)
entire team yeah hoo&#39;s ultimate ho (28:29 - 28:36)
ultimate is to (28:34 - 28:41)
revive so this is it&#39;s a bit of a caveat (28:36 - 28:46)
it revives nearby knocked out allies so (28:41 - 28:49)
they do have to sort of be in (28:46 - 28:55)
range uh it uses AOS energy to revive (28:49 - 28:57)
more allies so I believe if you have (28:55 - 28:59)
none it will revive one and then it goes (28:57 - 29:01)
up from there to potentially everybody (28:59 - 29:03)
when you&#39;re at (29:01 - 29:06)
50 this will (29:03 - 29:10)
make reggi Ali pushes and Rayquaza (29:06 - 29:13)
pushes an absolute (29:10 - 29:15)
nightmare because if hoo is there it (29:13 - 29:18)
will stay hidden and then if the team (29:15 - 29:19)
gets what it just swoops in and does its (29:18 - 29:22)
unite and everybody&#39;s back with the (29:19 - 29:26)
other team way on the back foot uh and (29:22 - 29:28)
I&#39;ve seen it revive all the people I (29:26 - 29:30)
mean at that special that rqu at that (29:28 - 29:32)
level in the game some of your allies (29:30 - 29:36)
have a 30 second timer or a 25 second (29:32 - 29:38)
timer before they respawn so they&#39;re (29:36 - 29:41)
just sitting there and you have a lot of (29:38 - 29:45)
time to bring all of these people back (29:41 - 29:48)
and since ho is a Defender and has at (29:45 - 29:52)
current look a bajillion Health uh (29:48 - 29:54)
you&#39;re not taking it (29:52 - 29:56)
down you&#39;re not I was going to say it (29:54 - 29:57)
would be like (29:56 - 30:00)
early uh um eligos plays where you you (29:57 - 30:03)
ignore everyone but the El you ignore (30:00 - 30:04)
everyone but the eligos you take down (30:03 - 30:07)
the eligos then you can kind of win so (30:04 - 30:10)
ideally you ignore everyone but ho oh (30:07 - 30:12)
but because ho oh will have so much HP (30:10 - 30:14)
it&#39;s a lot easier said than done yeah (30:12 - 30:18)
and hoo will most likely be hiding (30:14 - 30:21)
somewhere because they have fly and fly (30:18 - 30:26)
lets them fly over walls so you have no (30:21 - 30:28)
idea it could be anywhere it will fly in (30:26 - 30:30)
like here&#39;s here&#39;s a here&#39;s a serious (30:28 - 30:33)
question what is happening do you think (30:30 - 30:37)
that this I do okay before before Greg (30:33 - 30:40)
answers this I do think hoo Reviving (30:37 - 30:43)
teammates is thematically really cool (30:40 - 30:46)
and fits with hoo I think absolutely (30:43 - 30:47)
very on (30:46 - 30:50)
theme do you think that this is more (30:47 - 30:53)
powerful than a Mewtwo or a zachian or a (30:50 - 30:56)
maridon like if you could only pick one (30:53 - 30:59)
ex is this going to overshadow the ones (30:56 - 31:00)
I just (30:59 - 31:04)
named at at what I&#39;ve seen so far yes um (31:00 - 31:08)
it is also putting out a lot of damage (31:04 - 31:12)
like the fire spin that I&#39;ve watched it (31:08 - 31:14)
happen (31:12 - 31:17)
is at this point (31:14 - 31:22)
tuned way high you get a shield effect (31:17 - 31:26)
and if if you can knock out its Shield (31:22 - 31:28)
it can&#39;t do the Heatwave explosion (31:26 - 31:30)
except like all those moves you can (31:28 - 31:32)
release the heat wave explosion when you (31:30 - 31:35)
want so the goal is of course things (31:32 - 31:36)
will be lured in to try to take out the (31:35 - 31:38)
shield and then you release the shield (31:36 - 31:40)
and you do this massive amount of damage (31:38 - 31:45)
to everything around you and then you (31:40 - 31:46)
weren&#39;t taking damage because they were (31:45 - 31:48)
attacking your shield and so then you (31:46 - 31:50)
still have a ton of health because you (31:48 - 31:52)
are ho (31:50 - 31:54)
oh (31:52 - 32:00)
and the worst combo will be ho oh com (31:54 - 32:02)
cuz K makes everything that is broken (32:00 - 32:05)
worse it will just hit on this thing (32:02 - 32:08)
that has so much health and just (32:05 - 32:11)
constantly heal it and never once be in (32:08 - 32:13)
danger of being forced off because I (32:11 - 32:16)
have yet to see hoo be knocked out by (32:13 - 32:18)
less than four people teaming up on it (32:16 - 32:21)
on the on the test (32:18 - 32:23)
servers it&#39;s right now it&#39;s really (32:21 - 32:26)
broken on the death server somebody can (32:23 - 32:28)
correct me in the the slack Discord or (32:26 - 32:30)
the YouTube comments if you&#39;re watching (32:28 - 32:31)
on YouTube feel free to hit the like (32:30 - 32:34)
button subscribe all that stuff uh they (32:31 - 32:37)
nerfed mercy and OverWatch to where she (32:34 - 32:40)
can only revive one player now instead (32:37 - 32:42)
of the entire team I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;m (32:40 - 32:45)
right on that I would assume that&#39;s what (32:42 - 32:48)
eventually would lead like in three (32:45 - 32:50)
months six (32:48 - 32:52)
months because I think I read that the (32:50 - 32:55)
AOS energy also determines how much (32:52 - 32:58)
health they get back as well yeah I (32:55 - 33:02)
would feel like the eventual Nerf is you (32:58 - 33:05)
revive one but if it has (33:02 - 33:08)
50 that one comes back at full health (33:05 - 33:11)
instead of the entire team coming back (33:08 - 33:14)
it&#39;s hard to say like they have had the (33:11 - 33:18)
X EX Pokemon eats AOS energy to do a (33:14 - 33:21)
thing which I think is a cool mechanic (33:18 - 33:22)
yeah but It (33:21 - 33:24)
ultimately (33:22 - 33:28)
is pointless because as we learned with (33:24 - 33:31)
zachian you spend all your AOS energy to (33:28 - 33:33)
do a huge attack but that attack kills (33:31 - 33:35)
everything around and they spill all (33:33 - 33:37)
their AOS energy when they die and you (33:35 - 33:40)
fill right back up it&#39;s the same problem (33:37 - 33:42)
that we are going to see with ho oh sure (33:40 - 33:46)
I spent all 50 energy at Rayquaza we (33:42 - 33:48)
killed the entire team Rayquaza gives me (33:46 - 33:50)
a huge jump back up and then I eat (33:48 - 33:52)
everything else and I&#39;m immediately back (33:50 - 33:56)
to 50 like it isn&#39;t it isn&#39;t a good (33:52 - 33:59)
deterrent to say I have to spend AOS (33:56 - 34:02)
energy when it results in knocking out (33:59 - 34:04)
opposing Pokemon and they drop the AOS (34:02 - 34:06)
energy they were holding that you just (34:04 - 34:07)
gobble it right back up again and you (34:06 - 34:10)
are barely down um I guess the the (34:07 - 34:12)
gamble is supposed to be if you do it (34:10 - 34:15)
and it fails then you&#39;re the one out (34:12 - 34:20)
yeah not the gamble is never a gamble it (34:15 - 34:24)
is always it is always spend it to blow (34:20 - 34:26)
everybody (34:24 - 34:28)
away here&#39;s the thing I&#39;m in incredibly (34:26 - 34:30)
excited for the Pokemon I think (34:28 - 34:32)
flavor-wise I think it looks cool I (34:30 - 34:34)
think it looks great moving around like (34:32 - 34:35)
they did a great job with all of its (34:34 - 34:39)
attacks the alt move is wonderful I just (34:35 - 34:43)
know it is already not going to make (34:39 - 34:45)
it&#39;s going to be mandatory at this point (34:43 - 34:48)
for the defender like like Blastoise has (34:45 - 34:50)
been mandatory as a Defender ever since (34:48 - 34:52)
this most recent patch this is just (34:50 - 34:54)
going to replace it and nobody would (34:52 - 34:56)
play anything else unless ex is are (34:54 - 34:59)
banned but ex is our only B basically (34:56 - 35:03)
every other season and only at Masters (34:59 - 35:05)
level (35:03 - 35:09)
so you know like we&#39;ll see when it (35:05 - 35:12)
actually hits live (35:09 - 35:16)
but it is so op on the public test (35:12 - 35:18)
server right now every move is (35:16 - 35:20)
incredible like it&#39;s basic Tailwind move (35:18 - 35:23)
which basically puts down when you (35:20 - 35:27)
defeat Rayquaza you get those Whirlwind (35:23 - 35:28)
spots that when you go through moves (35:27 - 35:32)
fast it makes those it just PS them out (35:28 - 35:36)
does so uh yeah it&#39;s Tailwind attack (35:32 - 35:38)
does damage and then it creates a whirl (35:36 - 35:39)
run on the ground for all of your allies (35:38 - 35:41)
to run through and get a speed boost (35:39 - 35:43)
that&#39;s its first basic (35:41 - 35:45)
attack that sounds pretty great I me (35:43 - 35:48)
it&#39;s great but it is Brokey it is broke (35:45 - 35:50)
it sounds like all of this is broken (35:48 - 35:54)
just every single aspect yeah it&#39;s well (35:50 - 35:58)
yeah I I am intensely curious what state (35:54 - 36:00)
it will come to when it hits the actual (35:58 - 36:03)
live servers but like everybody who (36:00 - 36:05)
plays like oh we love it it&#39;s so fun but (36:03 - 36:07)
it&#39;s absolutely (36:05 - 36:10)
broken I I do love our our League of (36:07 - 36:12)
Legends players in the comments because (36:10 - 36:14)
they answer a lot of questions I I I (36:12 - 36:16)
don&#39;t I have since I&#39;ve never played (36:14 - 36:19)
that game uh they did say for the ban (36:16 - 36:21)
list that for League of Legends everyone (36:19 - 36:24)
gets a ban so it but but there&#39;s so many (36:21 - 36:27)
more characters whereas unite only gets (36:24 - 36:30)
two bands and it randomly gets assigned (36:27 - 36:32)
to two people whereas like League of (36:30 - 36:33)
Legends solution is everyone just gets (36:32 - 36:36)
one ban yeah and then you move forward (36:33 - 36:40)
um now my my question though is does (36:36 - 36:42)
this happen in League of Legends where (36:40 - 36:44)
every time a new character comes out (36:42 - 36:47)
it&#39;s just busted from the people that I (36:44 - 36:50)
know that it is a common thing right (36:47 - 36:52)
like that is a is common in League of (36:50 - 36:53)
Legends too it&#39;s a common thing for the (36:52 - 36:55)
new character to be slightly overow so (36:53 - 36:57)
everybody&#39;s excited about it gets in the (36:55 - 36:58)
game and plays it and it&#39;s the thing of (36:57 - 37:01)
winning um this is more than slightly (36:58 - 37:03)
overpowered but this at this point is (37:01 - 37:06)
more than slightly this is this is (37:03 - 37:09)
Mewtwo levels of game like every ex they (37:06 - 37:11)
have introduced has (37:09 - 37:14)
been bad for the game for the short time (37:11 - 37:17)
before they Nerf it away like yeah they (37:14 - 37:19)
got to get their sales before they they (37:17 - 37:20)
got to get their sales and they get (37:19 - 37:22)
people to rush up and then you know it (37:20 - 37:25)
it you we&#39;re used to this cycle so it&#39;s (37:22 - 37:28)
like I&#39;m already mentally prepared (37:25 - 37:30)
prepared for how bad and unfund the game (37:28 - 37:33)
will be during this time period because (37:30 - 37:35)
hoo will be everywhere it&#39;s going to be (37:33 - 37:37)
impossible to take (37:35 - 37:39)
down you know I&#39;ll do this stuff to get (37:37 - 37:41)
it for free it&#39;s another ex character (37:39 - 37:42)
that I&#39;ll never play the only one I&#39;ve (37:41 - 37:44)
ever really played is Mewtwo I played (37:42 - 37:46)
that for like a hot second to see what (37:44 - 37:49)
it was like and then I moved on um and (37:46 - 37:51)
then we do have the rumors of what&#39;s (37:49 - 37:55)
coming after ho already so oh wait what (37:51 - 37:59)
what give give us the hint uh uh so uh (37:55 - 38:03)
CH turns into two Pokemon and one is in (37:59 - 38:05)
the game oh I did see this the other (38:03 - 38:07)
isn&#39;t yet so that is rumored to be the (38:05 - 38:11)
one after this oh that&#39;s very cool so uh (38:07 - 38:14)
that&#39;ll be interesting um we still (38:11 - 38:16)
people are still speculating that this (38:14 - 38:17)
is the time they&#39;re going to release the (38:16 - 38:20)
three Kanto (38:17 - 38:24)
EES I&#39;m like sure they&#39;re (38:20 - 38:27)
not but okay they have to at some point (38:24 - 38:30)
they have to at some point uh there (38:27 - 38:32)
there are speculations that it may (38:30 - 38:34)
happen one of them might come for Eevee (38:32 - 38:37)
day but yeah yeah that would make sense (38:34 - 38:39)
for they could milk it for a couple (38:37 - 38:40)
years yeah they&#39;re going to milk this (38:39 - 38:43)
for a while but I was like oh no but it (38:40 - 38:45)
works with ho because then it revives (38:43 - 38:47)
the three curs and then then you can (38:45 - 38:50)
have raich in the game now we&#39;re now (38:47 - 38:52)
we&#39;re just stretching yeah now we&#39;re (38:50 - 38:56)
stret but let&#39;s calm down here so July (38:52 - 38:58)
19th is when this comes to the game the (38:56 - 39:01)
anniversary is the (38:58 - 39:05)
21st um we don&#39;t have all of what (39:01 - 39:07)
they&#39;re doing for the anniversary (39:05 - 39:10)
everybody keep saying a new map I maybe (39:07 - 39:11)
I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t hey if you keep (39:10 - 39:13)
saying there&#39;s a new map you&#39;ll (39:11 - 39:15)
eventually be happen um starting the (39:13 - 39:18)
19th you should be able to do the board (39:15 - 39:20)
game to get ho for free so you might as (39:18 - 39:22)
well do it I (39:20 - 39:26)
mean it&#39;s easy to do the requirements (39:22 - 39:29)
that it has you do aren&#39;t particularly (39:26 - 39:32)
difficult uh to get your die rolls and (39:29 - 39:34)
you do it every day and if you do the (39:32 - 39:36)
thing or spending coins to get it for (39:34 - 39:37)
six it usually takes you about five days (39:36 - 39:40)
to get the license and then you&#39;re (39:37 - 39:42)
done got (39:40 - 39:46)
it uh Switching gears over to Pokemon go (39:42 - 39:49)
uh Pokemon go Fest Global will be coming (39:46 - 39:52)
up as of this recording CU we&#39;re (39:49 - 39:54)
recording before go Fest but this is (39:52 - 39:56)
coming out after New York go Fest uh so (39:54 - 39:59)
what Niantic has said (39:56 - 40:02)
is they&#39;re saying since 2023 trainers (39:59 - 40:04)
attending real world events such as (40:02 - 40:06)
Pokémon go tour Pokemon go Fest I don&#39;t (40:04 - 40:08)
know why they didn&#39;t say Safari zones (40:06 - 40:10)
because that&#39;s a true thing too and (40:08 - 40:12)
Safari I&#39;m gonna say and Safari zones (40:10 - 40:14)
have had a chance to catch Pokemon with (40:12 - 40:17)
exclusive location backgrounds souvenir (40:14 - 40:19)
backgrounds that appear on a Pokemon (40:17 - 40:22)
summary page now Pokemon trainers all (40:19 - 40:23)
over the world have a chance to catch (40:22 - 40:25)
Pokemon with special backgrounds no (40:23 - 40:27)
matter where they&#39;re playing from uh (40:25 - 40:29)
Pokemon backgrounds are a way for (40:27 - 40:31)
trainers to remember where they caught (40:29 - 40:33)
specific Pokemon they&#39;re great to Comm (40:31 - 40:35)
commemorate attending real world events (40:33 - 40:39)
or certain in-game events uh they (40:35 - 40:41)
display on the image summary page yeah (40:39 - 40:43)
so I guess if you&#39;ve never been to one (40:41 - 40:47)
of these events if you went to like um (40:43 - 40:52)
the LA c tour they had a picture of (40:47 - 40:55)
la where of La I&#39;m unsure of but a (40:52 - 41:00)
picture of la behind Pia or Diga not all (40:55 - 41:02)
of them some of them so you would have (41:00 - 41:04)
like a chance of getting a shiny palia (41:02 - 41:05)
but you would also have a chance of (41:04 - 41:08)
getting a location card palia so then it (41:05 - 41:11)
would make it more rare if it was a (41:08 - 41:15)
shiny palia with a location card and (41:11 - 41:17)
then if you wanted it to be even more (41:15 - 41:20)
rare it could be an extra extra small (41:17 - 41:24)
palia shiny Palo with a location card (41:20 - 41:28)
you see how with the adventure effect (41:24 - 41:30)
yes with the (41:28 - 41:32)
adventure yeah I guess some of them (41:30 - 41:35)
wouldn&#39;t have it&#39;s all (41:32 - 41:38)
RNG I worked hard for that location card (41:35 - 41:42)
um after catching certain Pokemon during (41:38 - 41:43)
certain events trainers have a chance to (41:42 - 41:45)
receive special backgrounds no matter (41:43 - 41:46)
where they&#39;re playing from these (41:45 - 41:47)
background will appear oh I already said (41:46 - 41:49)
that new special backgrounds will appear (41:47 - 41:52)
during select ingame events so this is (41:49 - 41:54)
from Monday July 8th through Saturday (41:52 - 41:57)
July 13th trainers will have a chance of (41:54 - 41:59)
special backgrounds from Ultra beast in (41:57 - 42:01)
five-star raids after making a (41:59 - 42:05)
successful catch and then for Global go (42:01 - 42:08)
Fest from July 13th from 10: to 6 (42:05 - 42:10)
trainers will have a chance of receiving (42:08 - 42:12)
a special background from Ultra Beast (42:10 - 42:14)
including ncrma he&#39;s not an ultrabeast (42:12 - 42:16)
though keep that in mind after a (42:14 - 42:20)
successful catch on Sunday July 14th (42:16 - 42:22)
from 10: to 6 trainers will have a (42:20 - 42:24)
special chance of receiving a special (42:22 - 42:27)
background from ncrma in five star raids (42:24 - 42:30)
at after a catch ticket holders we&#39;ll (42:27 - 42:33)
also encounter selia or lunala with a (42:30 - 42:35)
special background as part of their (42:33 - 42:37)
ticketed research when fused with (42:35 - 42:39)
necrozma with a special background the (42:37 - 42:44)
fused DUS man necros or Dawn Wings necma (42:39 - 42:46)
will have the background and and just in (42:44 - 42:48)
case you did not know of how the fusion (42:46 - 42:49)
stuff works because maybe you didn&#39;t (42:48 - 42:52)
play sun and moon or you never had a (42:49 - 42:55)
necros before if you&#39;re fusing these (42:52 - 42:57)
Pokemon together everything is based off (42:55 - 43:01)
the necros so if you have a normal non- (42:57 - 43:03)
shiny necros and a shiny (43:01 - 43:06)
salio which I don&#39;t think technically is (43:03 - 43:08)
in the game but pretend it was and you (43:06 - 43:11)
fuse them it would be a non shiny dusk (43:08 - 43:14)
made necrozma because it&#39;s all based off (43:11 - 43:16)
the (43:14 - 43:16)
ncrma (43:17 - 43:24)
uh the backgrounds just look like this (43:19 - 43:28)
they don&#39;t look like cities they just no (43:24 - 43:29)
which I guess makes sense because you (43:28 - 43:31)
can play (43:29 - 43:33)
Anywhere um it&#39;s just like another thing (43:31 - 43:35)
to collect so some people probably care (43:33 - 43:37)
about that some people don&#39;t some people (43:35 - 43:39)
care about shiny some people don&#39;t some (43:37 - 43:41)
people care about extra extra large some (43:39 - 43:42)
people (43:41 - 43:45)
don&#39;t um usually I like I like the city (43:42 - 43:47)
backgrounds a lot that have been there (43:45 - 43:49)
for the events these ones (43:47 - 43:51)
are (43:49 - 43:54)
not I don&#39;t know they look (43:51 - 43:56)
fine they look fine they&#39;re different (43:54 - 43:59)
they are they&#39;re fine (43:56 - 44:02)
like when I was in um like Sendai I was (43:59 - 44:04)
like I have almost all these shiny Ultra (44:02 - 44:07)
beasts but I at least want one Ultra (44:04 - 44:08)
Beast with each of the Sendai (44:07 - 44:09)
backgrounds I think that would be cool (44:08 - 44:12)
to collect yeah for sure these just and (44:09 - 44:14)
I&#39;m sure they look like things I would (44:12 - 44:16)
have made in Photoshop and Middle (44:14 - 44:20)
School Get Wrecked Get (44:16 - 44:23)
Wrecked (44:20 - 44:23)
designer it&#39;s they&#39;re just pasted on (44:23 - 44:29)
there it&#39;s fine they&#39;re (44:26 - 44:31)
fine um this might (44:29 - 44:33)
[Music] (44:31 - 44:36)
be this was like technically announced (44:33 - 44:37)
but then the Tweet was deleted so it&#39;s (44:36 - 44:40)
not like that&#39;s like niantic&#39;s fault not (44:37 - 44:43)
our fault uh but there was a tweet that (44:40 - 44:46)
went out that said Sun steel strike and (44:43 - 44:49)
moon gist beam Adventure effects have (44:46 - 44:51)
the ability to attract Pokemon enabled (44:49 - 44:54)
daytime or nighttime Evolutions that (44:51 - 44:56)
tweet has been deleted uh that was 20 (44:54 - 45:00)
hours ago as of us (44:56 - 45:00)
recording so I&#39;m assuming that&#39;s going (45:00 - 45:05)
to be a go Fest Global (45:03 - 45:08)
thing and that&#39;s cool like Adventure (45:05 - 45:09)
effects are super cool I don&#39;t think (45:08 - 45:12)
this is like a really amazing adventure (45:09 - 45:14)
effect I guess we&#39;ll have to see when it (45:12 - 45:16)
fully comes (45:14 - 45:18)
out (45:16 - 45:20)
but I&#39;m not going to complain like I (45:18 - 45:22)
think that that&#39;s cool like more (45:20 - 45:24)
Adventure effects (45:22 - 45:28)
please they all can&#39;t be like palas but (45:24 - 45:32)
they&#39;re trying nothing can pal is so (45:28 - 45:35)
good right now I told you Palos was (45:32 - 45:39)
better than dagas pus is so (45:35 - 45:41)
good yeah I don&#39;t (45:39 - 45:44)
know I&#39;m excited for the potential of (45:41 - 45:45)
more Adventure effects like these (45:44 - 45:47)
Adventure effects make sense like (45:45 - 45:49)
ideally you&#39;re supposed to be able to (45:47 - 45:51)
evolve like a daytime Pokemon at night (45:49 - 45:52)
with the adventure effect I don&#39;t know (45:51 - 45:54)
if it&#39;s going to do anything else since (45:52 - 45:58)
they deleted the message (45:54 - 46:01)
um (45:58 - 46:01)
but seems fine seems like cool yeah uh (46:01 - 46:08)
something to collect something to (46:05 - 46:09)
do (46:08 - 46:11)
so Hannah you said there was another (46:09 - 46:15)
thing that they updated the blog post to (46:11 - 46:17)
yes just before we started started (46:15 - 46:20)
recording they updated the global go (46:17 - 46:23)
Fest web page to include a couple new (46:20 - 46:25)
Avatar items that will be available (46:23 - 46:27)
during Global go Fest there will be (46:25 - 46:31)
a full necrozma outfit and an alolan (46:27 - 46:34)
Executor hat the necros outfit looks (46:31 - 46:37)
like it&#39;s from some Square Enix game yep (46:34 - 46:40)
okay this it&#39;s Final Fantasy coded (46:37 - 46:43)
hardcore yes very much so and then they (46:40 - 46:46)
also updated saying that if you are (46:43 - 46:48)
using Party play or playing on routes (46:46 - 46:51)
during Global go Fest you will run into (46:48 - 46:54)
certain Pokémon so if you&#39;re playing (46:51 - 46:55)
with friends in Party play you&#39;ll be (46:54 - 46:57)
able to encounter Pikachu wearing the (46:55 - 46:59)
sun Tiara and Pikachu wearing the Moon (46:57 - 47:03)
Tiara and oh cool if you are playing on (46:59 - 47:04)
routes you&#39;ll be able to encounter (47:03 - 47:07)
Pokemon like Ducket imoga and (47:04 - 47:10)
crabrawler oh very cool yeah nitic asked (47:07 - 47:12)
me for feedback after (47:10 - 47:16)
Madrid and I was like why was there no (47:12 - 47:19)
route specific Pokemon especially since (47:16 - 47:20)
I gave them the feedback that like the (47:19 - 47:24)
routes in Madrid were super well done (47:20 - 47:29)
and I wish I did more of them I I (47:24 - 47:32)
I didn&#39;t I I did two and both were great (47:29 - 47:35)
but I it would have been probably I I (47:32 - 47:36)
probably would have done them sooner (47:35 - 47:40)
knowing that oh there like the (47:36 - 47:43)
LA c tour you could get (47:40 - 47:46)
basculin on the route and the basculin (47:43 - 47:48)
had a chance to be shiny so you were (47:46 - 47:52)
more likely to like oh I want to do this (47:48 - 47:54)
to try to get the Bas in but there was (47:52 - 47:56)
none of that (47:54 - 47:58)
so not that I&#39;m saying I&#39;m not saying (47:56 - 47:59)
they took my feedback and they&#39;re adding (47:58 - 48:01)
it to Global go Fest I&#39;m sure this was (47:59 - 48:02)
the plan all (48:01 - 48:06)
along I just like I just wish that the (48:02 - 48:08)
routes had something especially since (48:06 - 48:10)
they seem determined to want people to (48:08 - 48:13)
do routes also there was no party play (48:10 - 48:17)
stuff at any of these go fests well I (48:13 - 48:18)
don&#39;t know maybe last minute the party (48:17 - 48:20)
played in New York I doubt that um (48:18 - 48:22)
probably not it definitely seems like (48:20 - 48:24)
they&#39;re trying to do a bunch of special (48:22 - 48:26)
stuff for Global go Fest specifically (48:24 - 48:28)
this year (48:26 - 48:30)
yeah so maybe their their their thinking (48:28 - 48:31)
was we&#39;ll save the party play and the (48:30 - 48:34)
route stuff for Global so that has some (48:31 - 48:38)
uniqueness to it that I could see the (48:34 - 48:40)
logic there for (48:38 - 48:43)
sure yeah being at the inperson events (48:40 - 48:44)
is exciting enough and this way they get (48:43 - 48:46)
to have some special things for (48:44 - 48:48)
everybody including the people who went (48:46 - 48:52)
to Madrid or New York to still be (48:48 - 48:55)
excited for with global right plus like (48:52 - 48:57)
to be fair (48:55 - 49:01)
it&#39;s already overwhelming to be at a go (48:57 - 49:04)
Fest yeah they want you to do so many (49:01 - 49:07)
things and so many like tasks pop up (49:04 - 49:09)
and so (49:07 - 49:12)
yeah (49:09 - 49:12)
um yeah I think that&#39;s all the Pokemon (49:13 - 49:18)
go news I knew this was going to happen (49:16 - 49:21)
when we talked about campfire last week (49:18 - 49:24)
that uh people were like w my community (49:21 - 49:26)
is still dead Okay so two things number (49:24 - 49:27)
one (49:26 - 49:30)
if you never had a community in your (49:27 - 49:34)
area I I at no point ever said campfire (49:30 - 49:36)
was going to magally fix that could (49:34 - 49:39)
definitely could have but like campfire (49:36 - 49:42)
wasn&#39;t like that solution I what I was I (49:39 - 49:45)
think what I was trying to say was if (49:42 - 49:47)
you did have an active community on (49:45 - 49:51)
Discord or on Facebook and then covid (49:47 - 49:53)
killed that Community or whatever (49:51 - 49:57)
happened killed that community (49:53 - 49:59)
I would then (49:57 - 50:01)
suggest checking (49:59 - 50:04)
campfire because that&#39;s possibly where (50:01 - 50:06)
people would have moved (50:04 - 50:10)
to or you know if the person who was (50:06 - 50:12)
running the Discord then got in contact (50:10 - 50:13)
with Niantic and then Niantic made them (50:12 - 50:17)
an ambassador and did that that&#39;s what I (50:13 - 50:20)
was suggesting I I do still stand by I (50:17 - 50:21)
think there are people that are like my (50:20 - 50:24)
local community is dead there is none (50:21 - 50:27)
but they didn&#39;t even bother to check (50:24 - 50:29)
that&#39;s what I was saying because there (50:27 - 50:31)
was a comment on the video on the video (50:29 - 50:34)
last week of like I live in this city (50:31 - 50:36)
and my community is dead and I looked at (50:34 - 50:39)
my own campfire I scrolled over to where (50:36 - 50:41)
they lived and I was like that&#39;s not (50:39 - 50:43)
true look at (50:41 - 50:47)
all I looked you just literally didn&#39;t (50:43 - 50:51)
check this was a thing in Destiny when I (50:47 - 50:53)
play Destiny whereas when Bungie came (50:51 - 50:56)
out with raids raids were six-player (50:53 - 50:58)
content you had you had to find five (50:56 - 51:00)
other people and then you had to go (50:58 - 51:02)
through a raid with these people and of (51:00 - 51:04)
course just like in Pokemon scarlet and (51:02 - 51:07)
violet if one person was really really (51:04 - 51:09)
bad it would probably cost you the (51:07 - 51:10)
entire (51:09 - 51:14)
raid just how it happened right like oh (51:10 - 51:15)
you&#39;re not leveled up enough you didn&#39;t (51:14 - 51:18)
bring the right gear why did you bring a (51:15 - 51:20)
level 56 Hoopa to this raid you&#39;re (51:18 - 51:23)
you&#39;re we&#39;re losing um and so what the (51:20 - 51:26)
community did for Destiny was they (51:23 - 51:29)
created websites looking for groups LGS (51:26 - 51:31)
and you would go there and you would (51:29 - 51:33)
post what you needed and then other (51:31 - 51:36)
people would post and that&#39;s how those (51:33 - 51:39)
communities formed or like Reddit and (51:36 - 51:40)
obviously that&#39;s what happened in the (51:39 - 51:42)
Pokémon go Community people made Discord (51:40 - 51:45)
groups people made uh Facebook groups (51:42 - 51:47)
and then for all these years people were (51:45 - 51:50)
like ni antic should do something about (51:47 - 51:55)
this they did it&#39;s called campfire I (51:50 - 51:57)
don&#39;t think campfire should be in in (51:55 - 52:00)
Pokémon go I think Pokémon go is already (51:57 - 52:02)
too many menus too many systems it&#39;s (52:00 - 52:05)
already bogged down it already drains (52:02 - 52:07)
your battery I do personally like that (52:05 - 52:11)
campfire is a different app uh campfire (52:07 - 52:12)
already has its own menu problems (52:11 - 52:16)
anyways of like how do I go back how do (52:12 - 52:17)
I find this (52:16 - 52:20)
group my point last (52:17 - 52:23)
week was if you&#39;re complaining that your (52:20 - 52:25)
local community is dead and you haven&#39;t (52:23 - 52:29)
checked campfire that&#39;s on you if you&#39;re (52:25 - 52:30)
complaining your local community is dead (52:29 - 52:32)
and you went to campfire and it&#39;s still (52:30 - 52:34)
dead (52:32 - 52:39)
hey I get it I totally get it (52:34 - 52:42)
but but don&#39;t say in my comments that (52:39 - 52:44)
your community is dead and then give me (52:42 - 52:47)
your location because I checked it and (52:44 - 52:49)
it&#39;s not dead you&#39;re wrong you just (52:47 - 52:52)
didn&#39;t (52:49 - 52:52)
check H the Vendetta (52:52 - 52:58)
[Laughter] (52:55 - 52:58)
also speaking of campfire one other (52:59 - 53:02)
thing you should be able to find in (53:01 - 53:05)
there are potential events leading up to (53:02 - 53:07)
Global go Fest that are going to be (53:05 - 53:10)
hosted with the Pokemon leagues across (53:07 - 53:12)
the country I believe where you can earn (53:10 - 53:15)
special events in special items in (53:12 - 53:17)
Pokemon go for going to these events (53:15 - 53:20)
leading up to Global go (53:17 - 53:20)
Fest there aren&#39;t any near me at least (53:21 - 53:26)
at at this point even though I know that (53:23 - 53:28)
there are multip play Pokémon locations (53:26 - 53:31)
so they&#39;re supposed to be showing up at (53:28 - 53:33)
this point we&#39;ll see how many of these (53:31 - 53:35)
events actually (53:33 - 53:39)
happen um yeah I have a bunch (53:35 - 53:43)
of like uh Global go Fest (53:39 - 53:47)
meetups or or gosh how to I never know (53:43 - 53:50)
how to get back to the initial map um (53:47 - 53:53)
there&#39;s the map button in the top right (53:50 - 53:55)
corner no no no not that map when you&#39;re (53:53 - 53:58)
in like a group like a group chat to go (53:55 - 54:02)
back to where like the events are got it (53:58 - 54:06)
yeah so I have uh ho oh tonight 62 (54:02 - 54:09)
people going ho oh in another area seven (54:06 - 54:12)
people going ho oh at lake (54:09 - 54:15)

of people and these are these are the (54:18 - 54:22)
these are just oh it&#39;s just showing the (54:20 - 54:24)
things I&#39;m subscribed to so I&#39;m (54:22 - 54:26)
subscribed to like the Nomas area and (54:24 - 54:29)
then the Uptown Minneapolis area and I (54:26 - 54:31)
think there&#39;s a Downtown minap (54:29 - 54:32)
Minneapolis (54:31 - 54:35)
area uh but yeah if you if you go to the (54:32 - 54:37)
map I&#39;m I&#39;m literally trying to help (54:35 - 54:38)
people out I&#39;m literally trying like for (54:37 - 54:40)
if you&#39;re a person that&#39;s like I don&#39;t (54:38 - 54:42)
have anyone to raid with I&#39;m I&#39;m I&#39;m (54:40 - 54:45)
telling you at least check campfire if (54:42 - 54:48)
you check campfire and there&#39;s nothing I (54:45 - 54:51)
get it totally sucks but at (54:48 - 54:54)
least check campfire because I do think (54:51 - 54:55)
a lot (54:54 - 54:58)
of Discord community ities or Facebook (54:55 - 55:00)
things they&#39;re they&#39;re not going to just (54:58 - 55:03)
suddenly jump start tomorrow I think I I (55:00 - 55:05)
think you can like unfollow you can (55:03 - 55:07)
leave those groups I don&#39;t think they&#39;re (55:05 - 55:08)
active (55:07 - 55:11)
anymore I mean with with go Fest coming (55:08 - 55:15)
up maybe they would yeah uh if if there (55:11 - 55:17)
was any time for them to be active it (55:15 - 55:19)
would probably be go Fest so if we get (55:17 - 55:22)
past go Fest and go Fest and they&#39;re (55:19 - 55:26)
still not active then probably yeah yeah (55:22 - 55:28)
and you can also like I I made a raid (55:26 - 55:32)
train for New York for we find out next (55:28 - 55:34)
week how that raid train went (55:32 - 55:38)
uh but I&#39;m not an ambassador or I don&#39;t (55:34 - 55:40)
have any like special privileges in (55:38 - 55:43)
campfire I just have a normal account (55:40 - 55:45)
and I I just made a raay train it asked (55:43 - 55:47)
me what the dates were it asked me where (55:45 - 55:49)
to start it it asked me to put a little (55:47 - 55:51)
description of picture anyone can make a (55:49 - 55:55)
group so be change you want to see in (55:51 - 55:58)
the world become the change I didn&#39;t (55:55 - 56:02)
mention this last week uh but like I (55:58 - 56:04)
used to go to a (56:02 - 56:08)
TCG um what do they call that like uh (56:04 - 56:10)
every like Sunday morning oh the play (56:08 - 56:11)
Pokemon (56:10 - 56:14)
League I used to go to play Pokemon (56:11 - 56:16)
League so you just casually play every (56:14 - 56:18)
every like sometimes it was Sunday (56:16 - 56:20)
mornings or Saturday mornings or (56:18 - 56:21)
Wednesday nights whenever they picked it (56:20 - 56:23)
was never Friday night though because (56:21 - 56:25)
you can&#39;t cannot compete with Friday (56:23 - 56:27)
Night Magic that is all Always Forever (56:25 - 56:30)
strictly Friday Night Magic I used to go (56:27 - 56:32)
to a play Pokemon League um every (56:30 - 56:35)
weekend I did for like three years and (56:32 - 56:38)
the reason I stopped was because they (56:35 - 56:41)
stopped like the the person the store (56:38 - 56:42)
was hosting it but like there was still (56:41 - 56:45)
a person that would come in and like (56:42 - 56:47)
organize and host it and since they (56:45 - 56:50)
stopped I felt like oh man that sucks I (56:47 - 56:54)
don&#39;t have like a weekly let&#39;s play TCG (56:50 - 56:59)
Meetup area so I I found a hobby not a (56:54 - 57:03)
Hobby Lobby a hobby what&#39;s the other one (56:59 - 57:06)
hobby hobby town Hobby Town I think it (57:03 - 57:10)
was called just like a maybe yeah local (57:06 - 57:14)
game store and they had they had room in (57:10 - 57:16)
the back for tables I think they could (57:14 - 57:17)
do like four (57:16 - 57:20)
tables and I applied to like do the like (57:17 - 57:23)
League thing and like Pokemon sent me (57:20 - 57:27)
the little like energy and the pins and (57:23 - 57:30)
all that stuff and because my the one I (57:27 - 57:33)
went to stopped doing it I started my (57:30 - 57:36)
own turns out I don&#39;t like doing that I (57:33 - 57:38)
don&#39;t want to like surprise I also (57:36 - 57:39)
dropped (57:38 - 57:43)
out I Now understand it understand why (57:39 - 57:46)
they dropped out but you could on (57:43 - 57:50)
campfire you could be that person maybe (57:46 - 57:53)
organizing grade trains or hey this is (57:50 - 57:55)
the park I play at for Community Day and (57:53 - 57:57)
that&#39;s why I play here because it&#39;s (57:55 - 57:59)
better than the other (57:57 - 58:02)
Park (57:59 - 58:02)
so I&#39;m just giving suggestions out here (58:03 - 58:07)
I&#39;m not I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s perfect game (58:05 - 58:09)
but the tools exist but for years people (58:07 - 58:12)
were like Niantic make something they (58:09 - 58:15)
did and it&#39;s (58:12 - 58:18)
surprisingly not dog water it&#39;s pretty (58:15 - 58:20)
okay it&#39;s pretty okay as a good (58:18 - 58:22)
description of it it&#39;s better than it (58:20 - 58:24)
was at I&#39;m not going to say it&#39;s amazing (58:22 - 58:26)
but it&#39;s definitely pretty okay (58:24 - 58:30)
definitely okay it&#39;s definitely okay it (58:26 - 58:33)
can only get better right I no that&#39;s (58:30 - 58:35)
not true that&#39;s definitely not (58:33 - 58:37)
true all right we&#39;re GNA take one more (58:35 - 58:39)

going to talk about that when we come (58:44 - 58:49)
back and we are back from our (58:45 - 58:55)
break uh this was June 25th uh 2024 so (58:49 - 58:59)
not not too long ago but uh game freak (58:55 - 59:03)
launched a new game that&#39;s not (58:59 - 59:06)
Pokemon it&#39;s also a mobile (59:03 - 59:11)
game they&#39;ve never done this before I am (59:06 - 59:13)
shocked it&#39;s actually called how could (59:11 - 59:16)
they release another game it&#39;s actually (59:13 - 59:18)
just a Temple Run Subway (59:16 - 59:22)
servers um no okay uh so game for uh (59:18 - 59:25)
this is off Nintendo life developer not (59:22 - 59:28)
a lot of people reported on this uh (59:25 - 59:30)
don&#39;t know why I feel like it&#39;s an easy (59:28 - 59:33)
click to say to put the words game freak (59:30 - 59:36)
and Pokemon in a title uh developer game (59:33 - 59:38)
freak has been known to dabble inside (59:36 - 59:41)
projects outside of Pokemon producing uh (59:38 - 59:44)
their words and I agree excellent pocket (59:41 - 59:46)
card jockey I&#39;m not sure if they&#39;re (59:44 - 59:48)
saying Litt toown hero was excellent (59:46 - 59:50)
because that&#39;s not true that game was (59:48 - 59:53)
not very good um but they did produce (59:50 - 59:55)
pocket card her uh jockey Litt toown (59:53 - 59:57)
hero they launched a new Bumble game (59:55 - 60:00)
called Pand (59:57 - 60:03)
land uh which they filed for trademarks (60:00 - 60:05)
at the start of the year uh although (60:03 - 60:07)
there&#39;s no worldwide release at the time (60:05 - 60:10)
of writing Pand land is available on (60:07 - 60:13)
Android and iOS in Japan it&#39;s described (60:10 - 60:17)
as a casual Marine Adventure RPG you (60:13 - 60:18)
travel the lands with your crew to (60:17 - 60:20)
collect various bits of treasure (60:18 - 60:23)
boasting some rather Charming voxal (60:20 - 60:24)
based (60:23 - 60:27)
visuals think of Pokémon Quest yeah it&#39;s (60:24 - 60:29)
Pokemon (60:27 - 60:29)
quesy you will also explore dangerous (60:30 - 60:34)
Dungeons and you can tackle the game (60:32 - 60:36)
either on your own or With Friends the (60:34 - 60:38)
official announcement from the (60:36 - 60:42)
collaborator Wonder Planet uh director (60:38 - 60:44)
of development one at game freak stated (60:42 - 60:46)
oh boy do you remember when like game (60:44 - 60:48)
freak said we have two development (60:46 - 60:49)
Studios and everyone was like well (60:48 - 60:52)
development one has to be the main (60:49 - 60:55)
Studio well it does it has to be the (60:52 - 60:57)
main one it has to be (60:55 - 61:00)
uh the developer the director says quote (60:57 - 61:01)
we&#39;ve been working hard to create a game (61:00 - 61:03)
that takes the scale of a console game (61:01 - 61:05)
and makes it easy and simple to play it (61:03 - 61:08)
was a difficult challenges for us alone (61:05 - 61:12)
uh but by borrowing the help of Wonder (61:08 - 61:14)
Planet which has a previous proven track (61:12 - 61:17)
record in mobile games we were able to (61:14 - 61:18)
make this (61:17 - 61:21)
announcement uh and then Nintendo life (61:18 - 61:23)
goes on and says it looks like this is (61:21 - 61:24)
quite the departure from what we&#39;re used (61:23 - 61:26)
to seeing with Game Freak the studio has (61:24 - 61:27)
always always proven it&#39;s ch chops when (61:26 - 61:29)
it&#39;s not bogged down by Pokemon (61:27 - 61:32)
hopefully Pand land gets a worldwide (61:29 - 61:34)
release near the future we would love to (61:32 - 61:36)
try it (61:34 - 61:36)
out uh if you just look at like the (61:37 - 61:44)
screenshot number one it does give (61:42 - 61:45)
Pokemon Quest Vibes especially the (61:44 - 61:48)
little like pig in the boat or like the (61:45 - 61:51)
little parrot on the the the ship (61:48 - 61:54)
sale I&#39;ve never wanted to play a game (61:51 - 61:58)
more though it looks (61:54 - 61:58)
I think the art style alone has like (61:58 - 62:02)
sold me on this yeah you like this art (62:00 - 62:05)
style yeah you I love it (62:02 - 62:08)
style I I had no idea the word voxel was (62:05 - 62:09)
a thing but apparently it is a (62:08 - 62:12)
three-dimensional counterpart to a pixel (62:09 - 62:15)
and that is this art (62:12 - 62:15)
style yeah I like the word voxel uh (62:16 - 62:21)
there&#39;s like a giant dragon in the (62:19 - 62:23)
background and then a little dragon and (62:21 - 62:26)
then a little dragon (62:23 - 62:30)
like something with like a the crank on (62:26 - 62:32)
the back of a toy that you spin I don&#39;t (62:30 - 62:33)
know (62:32 - 62:36)
what like like the old s the like the to (62:33 - 62:40)
the windup toys yeah like one of the (62:36 - 62:43)
Dragons has like one of that there&#39;s a (62:40 - 62:45)
there&#39;s a a YouTube video if you&#39;re (62:43 - 62:48)
curious (62:45 - 62:48)
um it it it looks cool though uh I don&#39;t (62:48 - 62:59)
know what else Wonder planet has done (62:53 - 63:01)
here&#39;s how I know this is a good game (62:59 - 63:03)
because you don&#39;t have to turn your (63:01 - 63:05)
phone in a different country and I will (63:03 - 63:07)
never probably touch (63:05 - 63:09)
it you don&#39;t have to turn your phone (63:07 - 63:12)
sideways for this yeah it&#39;s vertical (63:09 - 63:15)
interesting even though it&#39;s an (63:12 - 63:17)
RPG yeah the trailer makes it look (63:15 - 63:20)
pretty great um yeah okay I&#39;m not sure (63:17 - 63:21)
what&#39;s going on (63:20 - 63:23)
[Laughter] (63:21 - 63:26)
here uh but it looks awesome there&#39;s a (63:23 - 63:30)
unicorn in it I&#39;m back in not that I was (63:26 - 63:34)
not yeah I never (63:30 - 63:34)
left I I I do think that Pokemon quest (63:34 - 63:42)
which was made by Game Freak (63:39 - 63:46)
mhm was fantastic hands down just (63:42 - 63:47)
delightful to (63:46 - 63:51)
play uh the loop (63:47 - 63:54)
of surprise surprise getting new Pokemon (63:51 - 63:55)
and powering them up and going back (63:54 - 63:58)
through and like combining different (63:55 - 64:01)
Pokemon with like their abilities or (63:58 - 64:03)
what works with (64:01 - 64:06)
what (64:03 - 64:06)
fantastic other games Litt Town Hero (64:07 - 64:13)
maybe not so much and I ever played it I (64:10 - 64:16)
don&#39;t know I barely remember it was a (64:13 - 64:19)
thing I did purchase pocket card jockey (64:16 - 64:22)
when it came to switch which was what (64:19 - 64:24)
like two months (64:22 - 64:28)
ago and I played it on a 4-Hour plane (64:24 - 64:30)
ride from from the very start of the (64:28 - 64:34)
game and also just an absolutely (64:30 - 64:38)
fantastic game what a gem of like when I (64:34 - 64:40)
think puzzle games was a very puzzle (64:38 - 64:41)
heavy (64:40 - 64:44)
episode there is a timer to pocket Kart (64:41 - 64:48)
jockey for sure but the fast solitire (64:44 - 64:51)
puzzle mechanic is so (64:48 - 64:54)
addictive and so great I don&#39;t even like (64:51 - 64:56)
solidare that much (64:54 - 64:58)
see that&#39;s the that&#39;s the hook that (64:56 - 65:00)
Pokemon cafe remix is just missing you (64:58 - 65:02)
just don&#39;t get that feeling from that (65:00 - 65:04)
game but you absolutely get it in Pocket (65:02 - 65:05)
card (65:04 - 65:08)
jockey yeah and then like with pocket (65:05 - 65:11)
card jockey it&#39;s like you pick a horse (65:08 - 65:14)
you do a season um you can apply buff (65:11 - 65:16)
like you can buy things for your horse (65:14 - 65:18)
before the the match like it doesn&#39;t (65:16 - 65:20)
feel too punishing but so like if you (65:18 - 65:22)
come in second or third it&#39;s like ah I (65:20 - 65:24)
was so close I should have bought this (65:22 - 65:26)
one thing or maybe I should have done (65:24 - 65:28)
this like (65:26 - 65:31)
it but when you do get first place it (65:28 - 65:34)
feels like you did everything right it&#39;s (65:31 - 65:38)
just the loop in that it&#39;s like $7 I (65:34 - 65:40)
this is not an ad I genuinely think (65:38 - 65:43)
pocket card jockey is like one of the (65:40 - 65:45)
best under $10 games that you could (65:43 - 65:47)
purchase on thewitch start a podcast (65:45 - 65:48)
about (65:47 - 65:52)
it I will say though with Classic Game (65:48 - 65:54)
Freak optimization I actually don&#39;t know (65:52 - 65:56)
if game freak optimized it there there&#39;s (65:54 - 65:58)
uh there&#39;s some frame rate issues with (65:56 - 66:01)
that game on the switch yeah (65:58 - 66:03)
yeah yeah there&#39;s some slowdown you&#39;re (66:01 - 66:06)
like oh my horse is really chugging (66:03 - 66:08)
right now it&#39;s available on mobile (66:06 - 66:11)
though too right it is it originally but (66:08 - 66:13)
I I don&#39;t want to turn my phone sideways (66:11 - 66:15)
that&#39;s the problem it&#39;s the greatest (66:13 - 66:17)
game in the world but even then you (66:15 - 66:21)
can&#39;t be bothered to turn your (66:17 - 66:23)
wrist but it&#39;s it&#39;s more than just (66:21 - 66:26)
turning your hand to turn the phone side (66:23 - 66:28)
ways you need to readjust the entire (66:26 - 66:29)
positioning of the way you&#39;re holding (66:28 - 66:32)
your hands I kind of get it I want yeah (66:29 - 66:35)
I want to I want a d-pad I hate onscreen (66:32 - 66:37)
d-pads and onc screen like oh that&#39;s why (66:35 - 66:39)
I won&#39;t play unit on mobile I can&#39;t (66:37 - 66:42)
stand it I Sol fact that you can&#39;t have (66:39 - 66:44)
a controller with the mobile version if (66:42 - 66:47)
I could pair any Bluetooth controller to (66:44 - 66:49)
an iPad I would probably play unite on (66:47 - 66:51)
an iPad but you can&#39;t I would too they (66:49 - 66:52)
they just don&#39;t let (66:51 - 66:56)
you my iPad is 18,000 more times (66:52 - 66:58)
powerful than the Nintendo (66:56 - 67:01)
switch it just is the Nintendo (66:58 - 67:05)
switch how they&#39;ve lasted like seven (67:01 - 67:08)
years Nintendo switch is Animal Crossing (67:05 - 67:11)
not a powerful (67:08 - 67:11)
system um wonder I did wonder do they (67:12 - 67:18)
have a list of what else Wonder planet (67:16 - 67:22)
has made here to their Wonder planet on (67:18 - 67:26)
the App Store in Google and they made a (67:22 - 67:27)
Sonic (67:26 - 67:31)
RPG okay and an ALICE fiction puzzle RPG (67:27 - 67:33)
I don&#39;t know what either of those are (67:31 - 67:36)
Sonic Beat featuring crash fever which (67:33 - 67:38)
is not Sonic the Hedgehog some other (67:36 - 67:42)
Sonic thing and Alice fiction puzzle RPG (67:38 - 67:45)
I don&#39;t know what any of these (67:42 - 67:45)
are but that&#39;s what comes up when I (67:47 - 67:52)
search (67:50 - 67:52)
for it looks like crash (67:53 - 67:58)
crash fever is a puzzle (67:56 - 68:01)
RPG the Alice fiction is also a puzzle (67:58 - 68:05)
RPG and Sonic Beat is the music puzzle (68:01 - 68:10)
RPG so they are the puzzle RPG business (68:05 - 68:14)
although Sonic crash is Sonic fever with (68:10 - 68:16)
Sonic beat with crash fever does not (68:14 - 68:17)
have a good rating on the Google apps (68:16 - 68:21)
that I&#39;m looking at uh for those (68:17 - 68:24)
thinking I will just switch my store to (68:21 - 68:26)
the Japan App Store (68:24 - 68:27)
that would (68:26 - 68:31)
work uh but after watching I&#39;m at the (68:27 - 68:34)
Poo land (68:31 - 68:37)
website and they have more video of said (68:34 - 68:42)
game and there&#39;s a lot of Japanese uh so (68:37 - 68:44)
I don&#39;t know if you could just switch (68:42 - 68:47)
stores unless you know Japanese yeah but (68:44 - 68:51)
there is a giraffe in a boat and that is (68:47 - 68:53)
awesome the little giraffe was riding in (68:51 - 68:56)
that boat that was super cool uh I I (68:53 - 68:58)
gosh I I don&#39;t know how good this game (68:56 - 69:00)
is I&#39;m not even sure what you&#39;re doing (68:58 - 69:03)
in this game but it looks delightful and (69:00 - 69:05)
I hope that it gets a worldwide release (69:03 - 69:08)
I would assume it hasn&#39;t because of the (69:05 - 69:12)
language I they probably need a (69:08 - 69:12)
translator but it looks great oh there&#39;s (69:16 - 69:23)
a little mouse in Cube form oh my gosh (69:19 - 69:26)
I who cares about 8 bit 16 bit (69:23 - 69:30)
32bit voxel style yep that&#39;s the thing (69:26 - 69:32)
that that is what we (69:30 - 69:35)
need this unicorn is (69:32 - 69:39)
screaming there&#39;s a cow okay we got (69:35 - 69:42)

E3 shut down that they were like making (69:47 - 69:53)

um paper uh Rock Paper Shotgun is the (70:06 - 70:12)
website which is (70:10 - 70:14)
actually this website&#39;s been around for (70:12 - 70:16)
a while so don&#39;t it it&#39;s a weird name (70:14 - 70:17)
but (70:16 - 70:20)
like uh this was (70:17 - 70:22)
from let&#39;s see what&#39;s the date on this (70:20 - 70:25)
article May 10th 2023 (70:22 - 70:28)
Pokemon developers game freak announced (70:25 - 70:31)

pair are working on a brand new action (70:45 - 70:50)
adventure IP code named project Bloom (70:47 - 70:52)
we&#39;ve been teased a single piece of (70:50 - 70:55)
concept art that shows a brooding (70:52 - 70:56)
character dressed in traditional (70:55 - 70:57)
Japanese clothing contemplating (70:56 - 71:00)
something in a very dreamy (70:57 - 71:04)
Forest uh game freak director quote says (71:00 - 71:06)
we are thrilled to have an opportunity (71:04 - 71:09)
to create a new IP that is bold and (71:06 - 71:12)
different from our prior work uh private (71:09 - 71:15)
division was the P private division is (71:12 - 71:17)

early development it won&#39;t launch until (71:39 - 71:44)
take 2&#39;s fiscal year of (71:41 - 71:48)
2026 okay okay so that makes sense we (71:44 - 71:49)
got a (71:48 - 71:52)
while I don&#39;t know if you guys know this (71:49 - 71:55)
but making games takes a while for some (71:52 - 71:57)
reason Pokemon fans just think like they (71:55 - 72:00)
pump out like oh it it did not take (71:57 - 72:03)
Legends Za one year to make I am sure (72:00 - 72:04)
they&#39;ve been working on this game for (72:03 - 72:07)
quite a while it was only a (72:04 - 72:09)
year it looks like private division was (72:07 - 72:12)
the publisher for Hades too so that&#39;s a (72:09 - 72:13)
game that a lot of people have probably (72:12 - 72:18)
heard of yeah good call Hannah Hades is (72:13 - 72:20)
fantastic what a good game have you (72:18 - 72:23)
played Hades 2 yet no I think it&#39;s still (72:20 - 72:27)
in Early Access or something (72:23 - 72:27)
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fully out yet it&#39;s (72:27 - 72:32)
not out on every device but I thought it (72:30 - 72:35)
was I thought it was out testing anymore (72:32 - 72:36)
but (72:35 - 72:39)
maybe I don&#39;t actually know I I remember (72:36 - 72:42)
when people were getting Early Access (72:39 - 72:44)
and I was like I&#39;m just going to wait (72:42 - 72:45)
maybe I waited too long maybe it&#39;s (72:44 - 72:48)
already (72:45 - 72:48)
out oh it did come out it came out on (72:49 - 72:54)
May 6 oh okay okay you&#39;re way too late (72:51 - 72:56)
I&#39;m too late what I play Hades on I (72:54 - 72:58)
think I played it on my (72:56 - 73:01)
PlayStation play I don&#39;t think I want to (72:58 - 73:02)
play it on my switch if it&#39;s on I don&#39;t (73:01 - 73:04)
think it&#39;s on switch but I don&#39;t think I (73:02 - 73:06)
want play switch (73:04 - 73:08)
yet okay so if you need new games play (73:06 - 73:09)
on your (73:08 - 73:14)
PC Hades get that uh pocket card jockey (73:09 - 73:18)
get that that&#39;s pretty good Delete Cafe (73:14 - 73:22)
remix unless you really love Cafe remix (73:18 - 73:24)
unless you&#39;re one of the people really (73:22 - 73:27)
supporting that game I support you and (73:24 - 73:29)
your poor choices in life whatever you (73:27 - 73:33)
want to make install (73:29 - 73:33)
campfire oh yeah I didn&#39;t know that (73:33 - 73:38)
Hades 2 came out I remember (73:35 - 73:41)
the the the Early Access stuff and I was (73:38 - 73:43)
like I&#39;ll just wait I&#39;ll just wait and (73:41 - 73:45)
then I waited too long that&#39;s fine I (73:43 - 73:46)
have something to look forward to when I (73:45 - 73:49)
get back from go (73:46 - 73:49)
Fest or at this point I&#39;ll probably just (73:50 - 73:55)
wait till it goes on sale right like (73:52 - 73:58)
oh yeah now that the hype is already (73:55 - 74:00)
passed yeah yeah yeah now just give it (73:58 - 74:01)
another month or so and it&#39;ll be on like (74:00 - 74:03)
summer game (74:01 - 74:06)
deals a thousand or (74:03 - 74:09)
whatever uh okay well I think that&#39;s our (74:06 - 74:11)
episode a little bit shorter episode for (74:09 - 74:12)
the week since we are recording early (74:11 - 74:15)
we&#39;ll be at go Fest um if we saw you at (74:12 - 74:19)
go Fest it was fantastic uh if it rained (74:15 - 74:21)
sorry curse you (74:19 - 74:25)
Niantic um put the weather machine up (74:21 - 74:27)
we know you have (74:25 - 74:29)
it uh and then I think the three of us (74:27 - 74:30)
will come back after G Fest and we&#39;ll (74:29 - 74:34)
we&#39;ll talk about our experiences um and (74:30 - 74:36)
then there will be Global go Fest so I (74:34 - 74:37)
don&#39;t know if there&#39;ll be much to talk (74:36 - 74:39)
about for Global go Fest but I&#39;m sure (74:37 - 74:41)
we&#39;ll spend like 101 15 minutes on it as (74:39 - 74:44)
well so and we&#39;re getting closer and (74:41 - 74:46)
closer to Worlds so I&#39;m sure more worlds (74:44 - 74:47)
information will come (74:46 - 74:52)
out I would imagine that if we don&#39;t (74:47 - 74:54)
hear anything about pocket before worlds (74:52 - 74:57)
we would hear about it at Worlds like (74:54 - 74:59)
this is their only big game for the year (74:57 - 75:01)
and it feels like it will (74:59 - 75:04)
be bigger than people are anticipating I (75:01 - 75:08)
think I I underestimated Pokemon go I (75:04 - 75:10)
not underestimating this I I genuinely (75:08 - 75:11)
think this (75:10 - 75:16)
is this is something that feels perfect (75:11 - 75:20)
for the mobile platform I think it could (75:16 - 75:22)
catch on but I think that it&#39;s not going (75:20 - 75:25)
to be as I think it&#39;s maybe between Pok (75:22 - 75:28)
sleep in Pokemon go (75:25 - 75:30)
size I don&#39;t know marvel snap captured a (75:28 - 75:33)
nation they could steal that Crown it (75:30 - 75:36)
sure marel Marvel snap is still going (75:33 - 75:40)
yeah right I think it is I think so yeah (75:36 - 75:42)
I think I&#39;m just saying look it can peel (75:40 - 75:44)
people off yeah I had people come into (75:42 - 75:45)
my stream being like Steve you would (75:44 - 75:47)
love Marvel snap which I don&#39;t I I think (75:45 - 75:51)
they&#39;re right I just don&#39;t like Marvel (75:47 - 75:53)
like there&#39;s just not S I just don&#39;t (75:51 - 75:54)
connect with any of those characters but (75:53 - 75:56)
I&#39;m sure like the mechanics of whatever (75:54 - 75:59)
that is I&#39;m sure I would like the (75:56 - 76:02)
mechanics now if Marvel snap was voxel (75:59 - 76:06)
then maybe that well you can get that (76:02 - 76:09)
style in the additional cards they have (76:06 - 76:11)
all of that artwork that you can get in (76:09 - 76:13)
those cards oh really that&#39;s kind of (76:11 - 76:14)
crazy oh yeah they have multiple (76:13 - 76:16)
versions of all the cards and some of (76:14 - 76:18)
them are pixel versions and some of them (76:16 - 76:20)
are old comic versions and like it&#39;s a (76:18 - 76:23)
whole they have a lot of artwork to work (76:20 - 76:26)
with I&#39;ve seen two Marvel movies in my (76:23 - 76:28)
time only two I saw Guardians of the (76:26 - 76:30)
Galaxy and I really only wanted to see (76:28 - 76:31)
that because of (76:30 - 76:33)
Batista (76:31 - 76:37)
um I love Batista and then I saw Captain (76:33 - 76:39)
Marvel and I still don&#39;t understand what (76:37 - 76:42)
her superpower (76:39 - 76:45)
is maybe I&#39;ll explain it to you sometime (76:42 - 76:46)
yeah yeah I G leave that with a hamah (76:45 - 76:48)
because it&#39;s it&#39;s pretty obvious but I (76:46 - 76:50)
thought it was an okay movie but I was (76:48 - 76:52)
like I just don&#39;t quite get what her (76:50 - 76:54)
superpower is she can kind of like do (76:52 - 76:57)
everything I don&#39;t know not everything (76:54 - 77:01)
Just Energy a lot just a lot I don&#39;t (76:57 - 77:03)
remember much from that movie except (77:01 - 77:05)
there was like a jet plane that she was (77:03 - 77:07)
in oh and she crashed into Blockbuster I (77:05 - 77:09)
remember the Blockbuster part yeah that (77:07 - 77:13)
was the 90s yeah all right well I guess (77:09 - 77:14)
