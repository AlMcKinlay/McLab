because you said this June darling so I (0:41 - 0:45)

[Laughter] (0:46 - 0:51)
how dare you you were the Slowpoke I was (0:48 - 0:54)
the Slowpoke I I (0:51 - 0:57)
was in Saint Paul (0:54 - 1:00)
you showed up uh during lunch time well (0:57 - 1:03)
I was like I got there and then like I (1:00 - 1:05)
wanted to go eat I'm like what (1:03 - 1:08)
we don't do that until five (1:05 - 1:10)
we did it early uh will and I were (1:08 - 1:12)
hungry because we were I was up and (1:10 - 1:14)
we'll move yeah I was there helping will (1:12 - 1:16)
move too I get yeah but you weren't (1:14 - 1:18)
there when we decided to get lunch (1:16 - 1:21)
correct because I showed up at three (1:18 - 1:23)
like you said I should (1:21 - 1:28)
uh Hannah also here I am I was touring (1:23 - 1:30)
Apartments this last week and when I (1:28 - 1:32)
opened my phone to check and see if (1:30 - 1:34)
there was a pokestop or a gym anywhere (1:32 - 1:36)
in reach of the apartment I was touring (1:34 - 1:38)
I got into a great conversation with the (1:36 - 1:39)
person who was showing me around about (1:38 - 1:41)
Pokemon go and that's one of the reasons (1:39 - 1:42)
I love that game that's one of the (1:41 - 1:44)
reasons I keep loving that game because (1:42 - 1:47)
so many people play that game even are (1:44 - 1:49)
you on top of like Five Focus laps yeah (1:47 - 1:52)
not five just one if I do get that (1:49 - 1:54)
apartment but one is more than none (1:52 - 1:57)
that's true didn't they for a while in (1:54 - 1:59)
apartment listings and real estate (1:57 - 2:01)
listings have Pokemon stops listed I (1:59 - 2:03)
think that was a thing for a very short (2:01 - 2:06)
time yeah that was that was for sure a (2:03 - 2:08)
thing for a short time that's amazing I (2:06 - 2:10)
wish they were still there yeah it's not (2:08 - 2:11)
as popular seven years in the game's (2:10 - 2:12)
boring (2:11 - 2:14)
and then they and then there were some (2:12 - 2:16)
uh houses that rushed to build one of (2:14 - 2:19)
those like little libraries oh yeah that (2:16 - 2:21)
happened well that happened all over my (2:19 - 2:22)
neighborhood (2:21 - 2:25)
long before they do were pokestops yeah (2:22 - 2:26)
that keeps happening regardless of (2:25 - 2:28)
Pokemon go there are so many I want to (2:26 - 2:30)
make into pokestops but I think they're (2:28 - 2:31)
not being accepted as pokestop (2:30 - 2:34)
submissions anymore they're not vital (2:31 - 2:37)
and the most there is (2:34 - 2:41)
this one house that has the worst books (2:37 - 2:44)
in there and I look at that and think (2:41 - 2:47)
when why did you buy these books until (2:44 - 2:51)
nobody's going to take them even free (2:47 - 2:53)
they have been sitting in there now for (2:51 - 2:55)
a year and a half untouched and unloved (2:53 - 2:58)
but I will tell you the one house in the (2:55 - 3:00)
neighborhood that changed it they made (2:58 - 3:02)
these there's a little puzzle Library so (3:00 - 3:04)
there's puzzles in there and because (3:02 - 3:05)
when you're done with the puzzle what (3:04 - 3:06)
are you gonna do with it you break it (3:05 - 3:08)
apart and you give it to somebody else (3:06 - 3:10)
that thing is hopping the puzzle Library (3:08 - 3:13)
always has new inventory (3:10 - 3:15)
the strange conservative political (3:13 - 3:17)
household that's got like a Tucker (3:15 - 3:19)
Carlson book in there from like (3:17 - 3:24)
1984. nothing's moving out of that thing (3:19 - 3:24)
on some DND books in there oh there's a (3:31 - 3:36)
there was a DND house for a while that I (3:33 - 3:37)
did look through there I'm like I have (3:36 - 3:39)
all this okay (3:37 - 3:42)
all right well we have uh some Pokemon (3:39 - 3:46)
news today uh deciduous first weekend is (3:42 - 3:47)
done so we're gonna probably start off (3:46 - 3:49)
talking about that first uh the 3DS (3:47 - 3:52)
eShop is closing (3:49 - 3:54)
which I think is in like two like seven (3:52 - 3:56)
days or so I got dates (3:54 - 3:59)
um TCG stuff (3:56 - 4:01)
uh and then uh we got a new character (3:59 - 4:03)
coming to Pokemon Masters so that's what (4:01 - 4:05)
we're gonna tackle today I have a new (4:03 - 4:07)
character in Pokemon Unite (4:05 - 4:09)
yeah but (4:07 - 4:10)
something that was something to be in (4:09 - 4:13)
The Chopping Block (4:10 - 4:15)
you just hate Goodra because Goodra is (4:13 - 4:17)
slimy (4:15 - 4:21)
um just fine uh (4:17 - 4:23)
it's okay (4:21 - 4:25)
no it's you know it's not a top tier XY (4:23 - 4:26)
Pokemon (4:25 - 4:29)
people are excited about it (4:26 - 4:33)
it's a cute Pokemon yeah it makes things (4:29 - 4:36)
rain it really was for sure one of those (4:33 - 4:38)
Pokemon and X and Y where I felt like (4:36 - 4:40)
everyone liked it regardless of what it (4:38 - 4:42)
evolved into like I felt like everyone (4:40 - 4:45)
saw Gumi on that route that was rainy in (4:42 - 4:47)
the mud and then everyone caught it and (4:45 - 4:49)
added it to their team except for me (4:47 - 4:52)
because like they went oh oh heck no I (4:49 - 4:54)
do not need snot on my team thank you (4:52 - 4:58)
very much no thank you the hard pass (4:54 - 5:01)
it's a Pokemon that makes me feel a (4:58 - 5:03)
little iffy about it but I like it (5:01 - 5:05)
regardless (5:03 - 5:07)
you feel happy about it because you've (5:05 - 5:09)
seen that in your Kleenex when you had a (5:07 - 5:11)
cold (5:09 - 5:11)
all right let's uh let's start off with (5:14 - 5:17)
uh decidueye (5:16 - 5:20)
uh start off with the scarlet and violet (5:17 - 5:23)
stuff uh deciduey was the fifth seventh (5:20 - 5:26)
star raid we had Charizard cinderius (5:23 - 5:29)
Greninja Pikachu and now decidueye (5:26 - 5:32)
um it was the Flying Terror type (5:29 - 5:34)
and (5:32 - 5:38)
it was uh uh an event (5:34 - 5:42)
yeah I I had an amazing experience (5:38 - 5:45)
uh four friends and I all brought Bex (5:42 - 5:48)
calibers a whole line up we went in and (5:45 - 5:49)
the game said (5:48 - 5:51)
decidueye is awed by your awesomeness (5:49 - 5:53)
and then it just went to the catch (5:51 - 5:56)
screen got it got it you caught it but (5:53 - 5:58)
then after that I did the postcard (5:56 - 6:00)
transfer for Vivion and my entire switch (5:58 - 6:03)
dissolved in my hands so got it I don't (6:00 - 6:04)
have proof I don't even have a switch (6:03 - 6:06)
anymore because it got eaten (6:04 - 6:10)
yeah feather dancing to a Bolivia (6:06 - 6:13)
uh decidue I ended up being a brave (6:10 - 6:17)
nature which is attack up speed down uh (6:13 - 6:18)
although like I've said before I will (6:17 - 6:20)
say it again speed does not matter in (6:18 - 6:22)
raids especially when the computer gets (6:20 - 6:23)
to decide they want to go four times in (6:22 - 6:26)
a row like what a speed matter at that (6:23 - 6:27)
point (6:26 - 6:30)
um uh it neither moveset Brave Bird leaf (6:27 - 6:33)
blade Spirit Checker uh air cutter which (6:30 - 6:35)
is a special move (6:33 - 6:38)
um the other ones were physical (6:35 - 6:38)
yeah low kick was the pain of the butt (6:39 - 6:45)
yeah and so I've been I've been building (6:43 - 6:47)
uh raid Pokemon for people to use and (6:45 - 6:49)
it's like really humbling and like super (6:47 - 6:51)
nice and what maybe flattering I don't (6:49 - 6:52)
know what the word is but like people (6:51 - 6:53)
being like I (6:52 - 6:56)
I don't know how to build Pokemon so I (6:53 - 6:57)
wouldn't be able to do these raids (6:56 - 7:00)
without these builds which is on the (6:57 - 7:02)
opposite side there are people that are (7:00 - 7:04)
like these are way too easy so (7:02 - 7:06)
I mean you're gonna you're always Gonna (7:04 - 7:07)
Hear both right you're always gonna hear (7:06 - 7:10)
people being like (7:07 - 7:12)
you know not not ever surprise not (7:10 - 7:14)
everyone is good at Pokemon right A lot (7:12 - 7:15)
of people like Pokemon but not everyone (7:14 - 7:19)
is particularly good at it so I think I (7:15 - 7:20)
do think (7:19 - 7:21)
um (7:20 - 7:23)
Game Freak (7:21 - 7:27)
has struck a good balance with raids (7:23 - 7:29)
being (7:27 - 7:32)
difficult but not too difficult doable (7:29 - 7:35)
but like maybe you fail once or twice (7:32 - 7:36)
like I do think there's a there's a (7:35 - 7:39)
pretty good balance there (7:36 - 7:39)
this is the one I failed the most yeah (7:45 - 7:50)
uh um (7:47 - 7:52)
interesting well my issues I only I did (7:50 - 7:53)
six of them (7:52 - 7:56)
and in three of them I got menu stalled (7:53 - 7:59)
so I don't I don't know (7:56 - 8:02)
I've won most of them even with random (7:59 - 8:04)
people yeah the I mean the random ones (8:02 - 8:07)
that are bringing better counters also I (8:04 - 8:08)
don't think people are bringing better (8:07 - 8:10)
counters they're bringing that they're (8:08 - 8:11)
bringing the Pokemon they've been (8:10 - 8:13)
bringing since day one which is mid ride (8:11 - 8:16)
on like like Mirada right on are like (8:13 - 8:19)
the top five most broad Pokemon yeah I (8:16 - 8:22)
mean variety works this time (8:19 - 8:26)
it just works as yeah (8:22 - 8:26)
like they're they're bringing a Pokemon (8:26 - 8:30)
with incredibly High base stats that (8:28 - 8:33)
sets up electric terrain which is (8:30 - 8:35)
incredibly helpful for everyone else and (8:33 - 8:37)
just happens to resist (8:35 - 8:41)
uh two of the four well technically (8:37 - 8:42)
three because Erica ever is this haircut (8:41 - 8:43)
or two (8:42 - 8:44)
um because Spirit shackle and low cake (8:43 - 8:46)
are neutral so (8:44 - 8:50)
I I the reason that um (8:46 - 8:53)
the reason that I've I saw fails is just (8:50 - 8:56)
people (8:53 - 8:56)
still doubting or struggling to know how (8:57 - 9:02)
powerful something like sword stance is (9:00 - 9:08)
oh yeah yeah yeah yep and so like (9:02 - 9:09)
um it's like not that big of a deal (9:08 - 9:12)
right like uh I think I I don't think I (9:09 - 9:14)
failed Pikachu at all if this is not a (9:12 - 9:15)
break anyways this is just like (9:14 - 9:17)
recapping like I think I failed (9:15 - 9:19)
cinderace like once (9:17 - 9:20)
um I don't think we've ever failed (9:19 - 9:22)
Charizard I'm talking about like me and (9:20 - 9:24)
my RAID group I ended up doing 30 (9:22 - 9:25)
decidueye and I think failed decision (9:24 - 9:28)
like five times out of like 30 30 (9:25 - 9:31)
successful raids five fails (9:28 - 9:32)
um and again it was just (9:31 - 9:34)
uh (9:32 - 9:35)
uh people (9:34 - 9:37)
being like okay raid Shield went up (9:35 - 9:39)
that's when he normally sorts dances (9:37 - 9:42)
swords swords dances swords swords (9:39 - 9:43)
dancing (9:42 - 9:44)
um (9:43 - 9:46)
and then (9:44 - 9:49)
I think there's always that like (9:46 - 9:51)
okay he doesn't have that much health he (9:49 - 9:53)
left let's attack but it's like his (9:51 - 9:56)
attack is now doubled and then all of a (9:53 - 9:59)
sudden you see two three Pokemon guys (9:56 - 10:02)
yeah yeah yeah which which the thing I (9:59 - 10:04)
want to talk about is every raid boss up (10:02 - 10:06)
to this point did two things before they (10:04 - 10:09)
started (10:06 - 10:11)
um so like Charizard would overheat and (10:09 - 10:13)
then reset his stats uh Greninja would (10:11 - 10:15)
set up Stealth Rock and then double not (10:13 - 10:19)
stealthtrack uh toxic spikes and then (10:15 - 10:20)
double team Pikachu would rain dance (10:19 - 10:22)
then surf Cinder Ace would bulk up and (10:20 - 10:24)
then usually like acrobatics or high (10:22 - 10:25)
jump kick (10:24 - 10:26)
um this is the first seven star raid (10:25 - 10:29)
that didn't do anything right off the (10:26 - 10:33)
bat and I wonder if that is because they (10:29 - 10:35)
tested opening it with Swords Dance and (10:33 - 10:37)
it was just way too powerful (10:35 - 10:39)
probably (10:37 - 10:39)
and that's what I based my Pokemon (10:39 - 10:45)
Builds on like the calculations for that (10:43 - 10:48)
is like okay what happens if (10:45 - 10:51)
um deciduey is adamant uh decidueye (10:48 - 10:52)
ended up being brave which is like the (10:51 - 10:56)
same thing as adamant it is uh attack up (10:52 - 10:57)
um (10:56 - 11:00)
I guess it could like like the special (10:57 - 11:02)
attack being down would affect air (11:00 - 11:03)
cutter but air cutter is such like a (11:02 - 11:07)
weak move anyways I'm not 100 sure like (11:03 - 11:11)
why they needed to have that move there (11:07 - 11:11)
um (11:11 - 11:14)
but like all of my calculations were uh (11:11 - 11:17)
adamant plus two Brave Bird admin plus (11:14 - 11:19)
two Leaf blade adamant plus two Spears (11:17 - 11:21)
chocolate and adamant plus two low kick (11:19 - 11:24)
which is funny because like (11:21 - 11:24)
uh (11:24 - 11:27)
low kick was like the ah maybe he (11:27 - 11:31)
doesn't have it but if he does have it (11:30 - 11:33)
it kind of like makes most ice Pokemon (11:31 - 11:36)
pretty obsolete (11:33 - 11:38)
um at all but yeah he did have it right (11:36 - 11:41)
like so when I when I build Pokemon I (11:38 - 11:43)
try to build for the worst case scenario (11:41 - 11:45)
right like if I was like okay I think I (11:43 - 11:49)
think avalug is the best Pokemon here (11:45 - 11:51)
and then all of a sudden there's a one (11:49 - 11:53)
percent deciduey has low kick and I had (11:51 - 11:55)
like 200 people built avalog and then (11:53 - 11:57)
low kick comes and one shots them it's (11:55 - 11:58)
like (11:57 - 12:00)
well like I put all these resources into (11:58 - 12:02)
a Pokemon that dies right away so I try (12:00 - 12:04)
to always build of like what's the worst (12:02 - 12:06)
case scenario (12:04 - 12:09)
um because again uh you know if if (12:06 - 12:11)
something's getting one shot (12:09 - 12:13)
if if this is UI or any other Pokemon (12:11 - 12:15)
has that move then it's it's really not (12:13 - 12:17)
that useful so that's why electric (12:15 - 12:21)
Pokemon were really really beneficial (12:17 - 12:22)
um (12:21 - 12:25)
but yeah it was interesting that (12:22 - 12:28)
decidueye didn't it didn't even like (12:25 - 12:31)
start off with doing anything like (12:28 - 12:33)
it could have opened with like feather (12:31 - 12:35)
dancing you (12:33 - 12:37)
um but maybe that would have been too (12:35 - 12:39)
tough it could have opened up with sword (12:37 - 12:40)
stands but that would have been like too (12:39 - 12:42)
like (12:40 - 12:44)
like I think the tough thing was (12:42 - 12:46)
cinderized was like a hard-hitting (12:44 - 12:50)
acrobatics right off the bat right (12:46 - 12:50)
or Charizard was like overheat's pretty (12:50 - 12:54)
powerful but it wasn't boosted but then (12:52 - 12:55)
Charizard reset its stats so it didn't (12:54 - 12:59)
have that like negative two or one I (12:55 - 13:01)
don't remember whatever he does (12:59 - 13:04)
I mean decidueye clears your stats on (13:01 - 13:06)
the second turn yeah that's true so (13:04 - 13:08)
that's as close as it gets to a an (13:06 - 13:10)
opening (13:08 - 13:12)
yeah uh um (13:10 - 13:15)
which which I which I think is like (13:12 - 13:16)
pretty clever right because most people (13:15 - 13:18)
boost their stats turn one and then (13:16 - 13:22)
disagree resets it (13:18 - 13:22)
but I I just wonder if in like testing (13:22 - 13:27)
they were like (13:24 - 13:29)
oh deciduey opening up with swords (13:27 - 13:32)
answers too strong (13:29 - 13:32)
that would be my guess because yeah I (13:32 - 13:35)
would decide UI opens with Swords Dance (13:34 - 13:38)
before anybody else can boost any of the (13:35 - 13:41)
defense in any way I I mean you can see (13:38 - 13:43)
halfway through a raid when everybody (13:41 - 13:47)
just starts to die right yeah (13:43 - 13:47)
well there there is like there there's (13:49 - 13:53)
probably like five people listening (13:51 - 13:54)
being like well I just one shot it and (13:53 - 13:57)
and yeah that's fine like (13:54 - 13:58)
um (13:57 - 14:00)
if if you're if you're playing with a (13:58 - 14:02)
group of people or or somebody doesn't (14:00 - 14:04)
have a ride on or you don't want to shot (14:02 - 14:05)
it and shield goes up that's where the (14:04 - 14:11)
the problems happen they start there (14:05 - 14:12)
um (14:11 - 14:15)
I I think I think it I think (14:12 - 14:19)
it was an okay raid (14:15 - 14:19)
um (14:19 - 14:23)
I do love Seven Star raids there's a lot (14:21 - 14:26)
that like (14:23 - 14:26)
I think I liked Pikachu the most because (14:27 - 14:32)
it just kind of felt so unique (14:29 - 14:32)
um (14:33 - 14:35)
into (14:34 - 14:37)
and like yeah he was holding a held item (14:35 - 14:40)
and and once you realized you could like (14:37 - 14:42)
knock off the held item with the move (14:40 - 14:43)
knockoff (14:42 - 14:47)
because she became significantly weaker (14:43 - 14:49)
uh but I I did really like this raid I (14:47 - 14:52)
wish there was a little bit more variety (14:49 - 14:54)
um (14:52 - 14:56)
in (14:54 - 14:59)
I don't know I I do think that I I think (14:56 - 15:02)
I said this pretty early on I almost (14:59 - 15:04)
kind of wish that (15:02 - 15:06)
raids (15:04 - 15:08)
it doesn't solve it in this problem (15:06 - 15:10)
obviously because I think miraidon is so (15:08 - 15:12)
powerful so like it doesn't really solve (15:10 - 15:14)
the issue I'm like the the suggestion (15:12 - 15:16)
I'm about to bring up but I kind of wish (15:14 - 15:18)
like raids were (15:16 - 15:22)
like only one Pokemon could come in (15:18 - 15:24)
so if like somebody locked in Mirada no (15:22 - 15:26)
one else could lock in my ride on oh (15:24 - 15:27)
there's somebody saying if somebody (15:26 - 15:29)
locked in belly Bolt everything (15:27 - 15:31)
obviously that would probably be on a (15:29 - 15:33)
team but yeah that would be (15:31 - 15:35)
that would be probably frustrating for (15:33 - 15:38)
uh some people like if they're only (15:35 - 15:39)
Pokemon they've ever built is iron hands (15:38 - 15:41)
and they've never built another single (15:39 - 15:42)
Pokemon and the only thing they know how (15:41 - 15:44)
to do is hit belly drum and then uh (15:42 - 15:48)
Thunder Punch or wall charge but (15:44 - 15:48)
I don't know I feel like I feel like I (15:48 - 15:52)
think the reason decidueye didn't feel (15:50 - 15:54)
like that eventful is like when you go (15:52 - 15:56)
in and there's just three other Mariah (15:54 - 15:57)
I'm sitting next to you and you're just (15:56 - 15:59)
like yeah wait just four legendaries (15:57 - 16:00)
against (15:59 - 16:03)
uh a decidueye it just it it doesn't (16:00 - 16:05)
feel like um (16:03 - 16:08)
this like epic Seven Star thing that (16:05 - 16:11)
maybe maybe the you know game freak (16:08 - 16:12)
never advertised those like this I feel (16:11 - 16:14)
like they did though I feel like they (16:12 - 16:15)
did advertise like seven stars I was (16:14 - 16:17)
like these are really hard challenging (16:15 - 16:20)
bosses and then when you're looking at (16:17 - 16:22)
the Sid UI and four legendaries are on (16:20 - 16:23)
your side you're just like (16:22 - 16:25)
I don't know I went in there with my (16:23 - 16:27)
belly bolts to a whole other team of (16:25 - 16:29)
Mirage and I thought we've got this yeah (16:27 - 16:31)
I don't have to worry about there being (16:29 - 16:33)
an azumar on the team and it just dying (16:31 - 16:35)
and taking our whole timer out (16:33 - 16:38)
we've got this we're good (16:35 - 16:44)
and I mean it sure makes it easier but (16:38 - 16:44)
uh you want to win the raid I don't know (16:44 - 16:50)
yeah I think it makes it easier if (16:50 - 16:55)
you're coordinated I still think (16:52 - 16:57)
I mean I went into a lot of rhythms that (16:55 - 17:00)
were a hot hot mess and did not did not (16:57 - 17:03)
like there's no way we're doing this (17:00 - 17:05)
none (17:03 - 17:08)
there's I mean what did you go into with (17:05 - 17:10)
a Berserker that was only level 54. I (17:08 - 17:13)
did yeah still there's still a lot of (17:10 - 17:15)
hot mess out of the general public that (17:13 - 17:18)
that they have to contend with so I mean (17:15 - 17:19)
I think (17:18 - 17:22)
I think it would be interesting if you (17:20 - 17:25)
could establish (17:22 - 17:28)
difficulty too like if you could say (17:25 - 17:30)
like (17:28 - 17:32)
you know there's normal hard and extreme (17:30 - 17:35)
and they would give different reward (17:32 - 17:38)
levels like oh sure sure like yeah (17:35 - 17:41)
random here is it you know here like (17:38 - 17:43)
here's normal for randoms here's hard (17:41 - 17:45)
for a decent group and then if you have (17:43 - 17:48)
a dedicated raid group try for extremes (17:45 - 17:50)
you'll get much better rewards but this (17:48 - 17:53)
is going to be really hard and take (17:50 - 17:56)
coordination I think that generally for (17:53 - 17:59)
in my viewpoint I've run into it most (17:56 - 18:02)
online games works better because (17:59 - 18:05)
you can still get rewards and still do (18:02 - 18:06)
it and get the the base thing like (18:05 - 18:07)
everybody's still going to get their (18:06 - 18:12)
decidueye but you can attempt (18:07 - 18:15)
to push yourself and push your group to (18:12 - 18:18)
more extreme things if you want to and (18:15 - 18:20)
it doesn't block the thing off from the (18:18 - 18:22)
more casual player (18:20 - 18:24)
I wonder I wonder what the percentage of (18:22 - 18:27)
people just doing it once (18:24 - 18:31)
and then not doing it all like I wonder (18:27 - 18:33)
because on on the flip side there I feel (18:31 - 18:36)
like there are also people that are like (18:33 - 18:38)
I tried it twice I couldn't do it I just (18:36 - 18:41)
gave up yeah I mean I think I think (18:38 - 18:43)
there's a lot of people that get the (18:41 - 18:45)
decision away and then don't see a (18:43 - 18:47)
reason to continue I'm one of those (18:45 - 18:50)
people like I played that night but I'm (18:47 - 18:51)
not gonna do the second weekend probably (18:50 - 18:53)
because there I don't think the rewards (18:51 - 18:55)
are good enough for (18:53 - 18:59)
my time I feel like vitamins and shards (18:55 - 19:03)
are good enough (18:59 - 19:03)
yeah but it like I feel like you you if (19:05 - 19:10)
you like the Seven Star raids even if (19:07 - 19:12)
you just like them to do them maybe five (19:10 - 19:14)
or six times like the vitamins and the (19:12 - 19:16)
shards are are useful for the next seven (19:14 - 19:19)
star raid or not like directly useful (19:16 - 19:20)
I'm not saying like the next Pokemon's (19:19 - 19:22)
gonna be weak to like flying but like (19:20 - 19:24)
yeah (19:22 - 19:26)
it is nice now that I know that I have (19:24 - 19:32)
like 999 uh dragon 999 uh poison 999 (19:26 - 19:35)
fighting like it feels like there's a (19:32 - 19:38)
relief of like I have I can change those (19:35 - 19:40)
spirits (19:38 - 19:41)
I have to worry about getting them if (19:40 - 19:44)
you ever need to right yeah and it kind (19:41 - 19:46)
of It kind of like steamrolls and stacks (19:44 - 19:48)
uh because like you know people at least (19:46 - 19:50)
in my perspective people come in and (19:48 - 19:51)
they're like how do you have so much (19:50 - 19:53)
money in certain or Scarlet Violet it's (19:51 - 19:55)
like well I don't have to buy like four (19:53 - 19:58)
out of the six Vitamins because the last (19:55 - 20:01)
raids have given me so much that like (19:58 - 20:03)
now I'm to the point where I have Max (20:01 - 20:05)
vitamins so I can just power up a (20:03 - 20:07)
Pokemon really quick and then okay like (20:05 - 20:09)
the only one I'm missing right now is (20:07 - 20:11)
like HP so the only vitamins I do have (20:09 - 20:13)
to buy is HP (20:11 - 20:16)
so it almost like (20:13 - 20:16)
indirectly gives you more money because (20:18 - 20:22)
you're not spending but again I'm (20:20 - 20:24)
probably building more Pokemon than the (20:22 - 20:28)
yes average person yeah I don't even use (20:24 - 20:31)
vitamins I just do it the old slow way (20:28 - 20:34)
the old the old Slowpoke way yeah (20:31 - 20:36)
because I need to I mean like I'm just (20:34 - 20:38)
sit here for a while and do this game (20:36 - 20:40)
for a bit like there's not much else for (20:38 - 20:43)
me to do yeah and the tarot shards are a (20:40 - 20:44)
really good reward but they're a really (20:43 - 20:47)
good reward if you're thinking ahead (20:44 - 20:50)
they're not a great reward immediately (20:47 - 20:52)
yeah it's not like I'm finishing (20:50 - 20:54)
cinderes and I'm like okay I'm changing (20:52 - 20:57)
four Pokemon to fighting (20:54 - 20:57)
so they're not as fun to get they're (20:58 - 21:02)
yeah it would be cool if there was maybe (21:01 - 21:05)
an extra bonus difficulty that may be (21:02 - 21:08)
only unlocked if you I think that's how (21:05 - 21:09)
it worked in Destiny I mean I think (21:08 - 21:10)
that's actually how it worked in Final (21:09 - 21:13)
Fantasy 14 like if you did the base raid (21:10 - 21:15)
it would unlock the harder version yeah (21:13 - 21:18)
you could go and you could go and do the (21:15 - 21:21)
quest to unlock the harder version yes I (21:18 - 21:23)
like I do like feel bad for people who (21:21 - 21:26)
struggle again like somebody somebody (21:23 - 21:28)
could be like well just get a ride on (21:26 - 21:30)
and and metal sound three times and use (21:28 - 21:32)
charge and then attack and do it solo (21:30 - 21:33)
it's like okay well number one like if (21:32 - 21:35)
they're doing it solo they probably (21:33 - 21:36)
don't have Nintendo online to like trade (21:35 - 21:39)
with somebody number two who's this say (21:36 - 21:40)
they have (21:39 - 21:43)
Violet what if they got Scarlet right (21:40 - 21:45)
like like (21:43 - 21:47)
I don't know like half I don't I think (21:45 - 21:49)
actually Violet sold much better but (21:47 - 21:52)
like 40 maybe it was like six to four (21:49 - 21:54)
like people bought (21:52 - 21:56)
um (21:54 - 21:57)
the other game and they don't have (21:56 - 21:59)
scarlet and they don't have means to (21:57 - 22:01)
trade but also like I could imagine (21:59 - 22:04)
going back to what Greg said like I was (22:01 - 22:06)
joining random raids because I that's (22:04 - 22:08)
like that's that's like my new that's (22:06 - 22:09)
like my new Pastime I'm like I need to (22:08 - 22:11)
see what I need to see what people are (22:09 - 22:13)
bringing (22:11 - 22:15)
and like you do see some ride on people (22:13 - 22:18)
just making the weirdest plays ever (22:15 - 22:20)
um but I was like I love seeing what (22:18 - 22:22)
people are bringing uh but like yeah we (22:20 - 22:24)
we brought we I went into a raid and I (22:22 - 22:26)
was like one person locked in my ride on (22:24 - 22:29)
the host had a Berserker and I was like (22:26 - 22:31)
um hello kicks that's not super good but (22:29 - 22:32)
you know you're the host and everyone (22:31 - 22:34)
else is locking in (22:32 - 22:36)
and then like the Berserker dies like (22:34 - 22:38)
instantly and you're like okay the (22:36 - 22:40)
preserver comes back dies instantly I'm (22:38 - 22:42)
like all right like I don't remember (22:40 - 22:44)
Berserker being that weak and then so (22:42 - 22:45)
you let go over and you hover above it (22:44 - 22:47)
and it's like oh the berserker's only (22:45 - 22:48)
level 54. (22:47 - 22:51)
and you just like (22:48 - 22:53)
it's like one you you question what's (22:51 - 22:55)
happening with this Berserker player (22:53 - 22:57)
right you're like question like did they (22:55 - 22:59)
just get the game did they miss the (22:57 - 23:01)
other Seven Star raids do they (22:59 - 23:08)
did like they they had to have completed (23:01 - 23:08)
five-star raids in order to unlock six (23:08 - 23:14)
star raids (23:12 - 23:17)
and six star raids are level 90 when you (23:14 - 23:19)
battle them obviously when you catch (23:17 - 23:22)
them they drop down to 75. (23:19 - 23:26)
did did they did they not do any six (23:22 - 23:28)
star raids (23:26 - 23:30)
definitely possible possible what was (23:28 - 23:33)
there was this their first (23:30 - 23:36)
decitui and they didn't realize it had (23:33 - 23:38)
low kick (23:36 - 23:41)
um why preserve it (23:38 - 23:45)
might not berserk her it's just and then (23:41 - 23:46)
I think about the other people right (23:45 - 23:49)
because like I mean all lost Maybe not (23:46 - 23:51)
maybe not everything is lost on (23:49 - 23:53)
Berserker right we we don't know if (23:51 - 23:54)
Berserker player is going to jump back (23:53 - 23:56)
in with like a different Pokemon right (23:54 - 23:58)
they learned their lesson but I could (23:56 - 24:00)
imagine somebody else just joining and (23:58 - 24:01)
then (24:00 - 24:04)
being like Oh we lost but not realizing (24:01 - 24:06)
that the Berserker was level 54 because (24:04 - 24:08)
like honestly that's like an auto loss (24:06 - 24:11)
that is like I I don't know (24:08 - 24:15)
how anyone like even if even if that my (24:11 - 24:18)
ride on player was like oh I'm gonna uh (24:15 - 24:20)
metal sound three times charge and then (24:18 - 24:23)
Electro drift right like theoretically (24:20 - 24:24)
the other three players don't need to do (24:23 - 24:27)
anything and ride on theoretically one (24:24 - 24:29)
shot it because that person would stay (24:27 - 24:30)
alive (24:29 - 24:32)
right but because that Berserker player (24:30 - 24:35)
dies once the ratio is going to go up (24:32 - 24:36)
relatively quickly which makes the metal (24:35 - 24:39)
sound strategy useless which then all of (24:36 - 24:41)
a sudden that decidua it's very easy to (24:39 - 24:44)
see how these things steamroll yeah they (24:41 - 24:46)
snowball real oh yeah snowball's a (24:44 - 24:47)
better word (24:46 - 24:49)
but again like going back to like the (24:47 - 24:50)
other people that are like okay I'm (24:49 - 24:52)
gonna join a random raid okay we failed (24:50 - 24:53)
it maybe they don't even understand why (24:52 - 24:55)
they failed it they joined an x-rayed (24:53 - 24:56)
it's another group of three different (24:55 - 24:58)
people and again could be same issue of (24:56 - 25:01)
like this person's bringing a level (24:58 - 25:04)
like 85 back Excalibur (25:01 - 25:06)
um and they're getting low kick twice or (25:04 - 25:08)
they're getting Spirit Shackled twice (25:06 - 25:09)
and they're dying and it's like (25:08 - 25:11)
this is unwinnable (25:09 - 25:13)
and that like and then you see a whole (25:11 - 25:15)
part of the community are like I just (25:13 - 25:17)
want to solo it because I do not want to (25:15 - 25:20)
play with the level 54 Berserker or the (25:17 - 25:20)
level (25:20 - 25:23)
whatever Back Excalibur but then they (25:20 - 25:26)
run into their own issues of like (25:23 - 25:30)
uh not having that type of support (25:26 - 25:32)
because again the rate can go much much (25:30 - 25:35)
smoother if your opponent is setting up (25:32 - 25:37)
a reflect if your opponent is heel (25:35 - 25:39)
cheering if your opponent is or you're (25:37 - 25:41)
not your opponent your your teammates (25:39 - 25:43)
versus (25:41 - 25:45)
having a Pokemon (25:43 - 25:48)
that can do enough damage but also (25:45 - 25:50)
survive but also hoping that your NPCs (25:48 - 25:52)
are good enough right like if you if you (25:50 - 25:56)
did decidueye with a Arcanine who cares (25:52 - 25:57)
every time that Arcanine dies he's (25:56 - 25:58)
coming in intimidating and that's like (25:57 - 26:01)
super beneficial versus like our believa (25:58 - 26:03)
which is like removing your electric (26:01 - 26:06)
train every other turn yeah I had (26:03 - 26:09)
I did do a solo one just to see who the (26:06 - 26:11)
MP NPCs brought and it didn't bring it (26:09 - 26:14)
up and I'm like (26:11 - 26:14)
I'm exciting (26:15 - 26:18)
I don't like we have a kind of a kind of (26:16 - 26:20)
terrain battle going on at this very (26:18 - 26:22)
moment it never ends (26:20 - 26:25)
like like the solo thing is almost like (26:22 - 26:29)
a randomized difficulty in like yeah (26:25 - 26:32)
praying that you get an Intimidator (26:29 - 26:35)
uh and like praying you just don't get (26:32 - 26:36)
something that like that's not like the (26:35 - 26:39)
kind of difficulty I'm not asking for (26:36 - 26:40)
like it's just like I don't want to like (26:39 - 26:43)
quit the raid and then restart and like (26:40 - 26:46)
hope I get Arcanine (26:43 - 26:48)
and then with like (26:46 - 26:51)
the online stuff (26:48 - 26:51)
like (26:51 - 26:54)
it it's not diffic like it's not harder (26:55 - 27:00)
because somebody brought a level 54 (26:58 - 27:02)
Berserker it's just like a guaranteed (27:00 - 27:04)
fail which wastes everyone's time and (27:02 - 27:07)
like yeah maybe they don't know but (27:04 - 27:08)
um (27:07 - 27:11)
I think they're I think (27:08 - 27:13)
they just need more information (27:11 - 27:16)
communicated I also kind of wish two (27:13 - 27:20)
things I wish that there was like well I (27:16 - 27:21)
wish the game didn't like lock up and (27:20 - 27:23)
freeze when you're in cheer menus but (27:21 - 27:25)
like I kind of wish there was like an (27:23 - 27:29)
advanced mode where I could turn on and (27:25 - 27:31)
see (27:29 - 27:31)
um like stat increases and Stat (27:32 - 27:38)
decreases and like their move I would I (27:35 - 27:39)
like that I don't know that information (27:38 - 27:41)
shouldn't be hit like your teammates (27:39 - 27:43)
move information should not be hidden if (27:41 - 27:47)
if your team like and you can hit the Y (27:43 - 27:49)
button and then go in and like hover (27:47 - 27:51)
across it and see that but that's taking (27:49 - 27:54)
away time that sometimes you need so I (27:51 - 27:56)
know not everyone needs that but it (27:54 - 27:58)
would be nice that if there was like (27:56 - 28:00)
some advanced mode to be like (27:58 - 28:04)
like is reflect up right now I think (28:00 - 28:06)
it's turn four I think it's kind of hard (28:04 - 28:07)
to keep track of turns when decidua is (28:06 - 28:09)
just like oh I'm just gonna attack three (28:07 - 28:11)
times in a row it's like (28:09 - 28:14)
what turn am I on yeah you know we know (28:11 - 28:16)
what this geek game really needs though (28:14 - 28:18)
Martin in Soul Rock (28:16 - 28:20)
true (28:18 - 28:22)
very true I hear he's gonna be an eight (28:20 - 28:26)
star hold his weight every time just (28:22 - 28:29)
kept kept it locked down had a strategy (28:26 - 28:32)
did that strategy would never be (28:29 - 28:34)
deterred from that strategy (28:32 - 28:37)
the other thing that I don't know if (28:34 - 28:40)
this was intentional or not or if game (28:37 - 28:41)
freak just doesn't maybe play test their (28:40 - 28:44)
games but when you hit the Y button to (28:41 - 28:46)
like hover above somebody right like so (28:44 - 28:48)
I was like let me check this this (28:46 - 28:50)
meridian's dying a whole lot let me (28:48 - 28:52)
check this ride on okay this my ride (28:50 - 28:55)
On's like it is level 100 I'm not (28:52 - 28:56)
actually sure why it's dying my guess (28:55 - 28:58)
would be like it's it's like not Evie (28:56 - 29:00)
trained Maybe (28:58 - 29:02)
but like there was a ride on in one of (29:00 - 29:04)
my rides it died twice pretty quickly so (29:02 - 29:06)
I like hit the Y button I hovered above (29:04 - 29:08)
it I was like oh it's level 100 it's (29:06 - 29:10)
Dragon Terror type which means it's like (29:08 - 29:11)
the ride Pokemon (29:10 - 29:13)
um because the electric Terror type my (29:11 - 29:14)
ride on is the one you catch in area (29:13 - 29:17)
zero and I was like oh okay well it's (29:14 - 29:19)
just dying a lot and then I go to attack (29:17 - 29:23)
and then by default it's hovered over (29:19 - 29:25)
that Mirada because it's the last one I (29:23 - 29:27)
looked at and it's (29:25 - 29:30)
I know like other people have like made (29:27 - 29:32)
this mistake where you attack your own (29:30 - 29:34)
teammate but you're like literally (29:32 - 29:37)
looking at your teammate stats which is (29:34 - 29:40)
like something that one the game allows (29:37 - 29:43)
you to do and two like answers a lot of (29:40 - 29:45)
questions especially if like the Marion (29:43 - 29:47)
is like level 70 right like you're (29:45 - 29:49)
getting a lot of Vital Information by (29:47 - 29:51)
like looking at your teammate stats (29:49 - 29:54)
um but like for the game to be like (29:51 - 29:56)
well the last thing you were looking at (29:54 - 29:58)
was my ride on so that's what we think (29:56 - 30:02)
you wanted chilling water like no like (29:58 - 30:02)
wasting valuable rain time to look at my (30:12 - 30:17)
teammates to like better evaluate the (30:15 - 30:20)
situation because I got seven minutes to (30:17 - 30:22)
go oh we're probably gonna film this and (30:20 - 30:24)
then I go to attack and it's my team (30:22 - 30:26)
well you were looking at them we're (30:24 - 30:28)
gonna attack the last one this is why (30:26 - 30:30)
everybody says Steve throws hard and he (30:28 - 30:35)
does he throws hard (30:30 - 30:35)
um (30:36 - 30:39)
I I think the raids are like really fun (30:37 - 30:41)
they're just they're they're just like (30:39 - 30:44)
two steps away from being (30:41 - 30:44)
maybe Perfect's not the right word but (30:45 - 30:49)
they're there's there's work that could (30:47 - 30:50)
be done (30:49 - 30:51)
there are small things that could make (30:50 - 30:53)
them better (30:51 - 30:56)
again I think that so many people (30:53 - 31:01)
default to solo because level 54 (30:56 - 31:04)
Berserkers are specifically Berserker by (31:01 - 31:06)
the no I'm just saying yeah if you're (31:04 - 31:08)
playing Berserker this is all your fault (31:06 - 31:12)
but I I I think I think like (31:08 - 31:15)
ten percent maybe twenty percent I'm (31:12 - 31:17)
throwing out numbers here I think some (31:15 - 31:22)
problems would be alleviated if you knew (31:17 - 31:25)
before the raid what level the other (31:22 - 31:28)
Pokemon were right like if again if I if (31:25 - 31:31)
I saw that the raid host was a level 54 (31:28 - 31:34)
Berserker I'd be like okay I'm out (31:31 - 31:36)
and I think other people would also be (31:34 - 31:38)
like I'm out and then the Berserker guy (31:36 - 31:40)
would be like why is no one joining (31:38 - 31:42)
everyone keeps leaving yeah because we (31:40 - 31:45)
see that your berserker's level 54. they (31:42 - 31:46)
would also be able to see that everybody (31:45 - 31:49)
else is level 100. yeah (31:46 - 31:52)
if the game said (31:49 - 31:54)
you should be at this level for these (31:52 - 31:56)
raids instead of just leaving it as a (31:54 - 31:59)
big secret like (31:56 - 32:01)
why (31:59 - 32:03)
why doesn't the why doesn't the ray just (32:01 - 32:05)
say this Pokemon is level 100 yeah like (32:03 - 32:07)
why doesn't it just say that why doesn't (32:05 - 32:08)
it why like like (32:07 - 32:12)
most Dungeons and raids I do say you (32:08 - 32:14)
must be at this level and have this (32:12 - 32:17)
level of equipment to be able to do this (32:14 - 32:19)
it's not a hard thing into implement it (32:17 - 32:20)
doesn't ruin the fun (32:19 - 32:23)
like oh okay I know what I need to be (32:20 - 32:25)
prepared to go into this that's that (32:23 - 32:27)
that's like setting proper expectations (32:25 - 32:29)
I don't know why (32:27 - 32:32)
I don't know what well there's a lot of (32:29 - 32:33)
things I don't understand why they made (32:32 - 32:35)
their decisions (32:33 - 32:37)
but that is one where it's like just put (32:35 - 32:41)
just put a guide put out an article (32:37 - 32:43)
something I mean most of your articles (32:41 - 32:45)
are bad but just like a press release (32:43 - 32:48)
you should be level 100 for Seven Stars (32:45 - 32:50)
one sentence I wrote it for you tweeted (32:48 - 32:54)
tweet it (32:50 - 32:54)
yeah ah (32:57 - 33:00)
yeah again I just think a lot of (33:03 - 33:09)
problems gets get solved if if (33:05 - 33:11)
yeah there are a lot of minor changes (33:09 - 33:12)
that could help this but that's a really (33:11 - 33:15)
really minor change even just being able (33:12 - 33:17)
to see the levels of the other players (33:15 - 33:19)
yeah I've been like (33:17 - 33:22)
you can make the argument of like well (33:19 - 33:25)
if it says like you must be level 90. I (33:22 - 33:27)
can't bring my like level one Shanks and (33:25 - 33:29)
do my level one Shinx tactic and it's (33:27 - 33:31)
like (33:29 - 33:33)
it yeah I guess but like if you really (33:31 - 33:35)
want it to be like difficult or like (33:33 - 33:38)
better bring up bring a bring a level (33:35 - 33:41)
100 Le chunk then like like you can make (33:38 - 33:45)
your own difficulty right like I I don't (33:41 - 33:48)
know it's just that's such a unique tiny (33:45 - 33:50)
tiny thing yeah yeah yeah totally (33:48 - 33:51)
they're they're it's like the people (33:50 - 33:54)
that are you know it's kind of it goes (33:51 - 33:55)
back to the same argument of people (33:54 - 33:57)
being like man I wish I wish Pokemon (33:55 - 34:00)
would instill some rule where I don't (33:57 - 34:03)
where like I I can't use items in Gym (34:00 - 34:05)
Battles and it's like yeah they could (34:03 - 34:08)
force that rule but also what if you (34:05 - 34:11)
just didn't use items like you you are (34:08 - 34:13)
making that decision like like why does (34:11 - 34:15)
the why does Game Freak need to be like (34:13 - 34:17)
no items used in this gym like they (34:15 - 34:19)
don't you could just decide that (34:17 - 34:22)
yourself so like I I feel like if they (34:19 - 34:24)
if I feel like maybe the pushback would (34:22 - 34:26)
be like well game freak says I need to (34:24 - 34:27)
be level 90. this sucks I wanted to (34:26 - 34:29)
bring my like level (34:27 - 34:32)
to this raid and it's like (34:29 - 34:35)
that's not beneficial to anyone but also (34:32 - 34:36)
like (34:35 - 34:38)
if you wanted to be hard bring a level (34:36 - 34:40)
one I promise you it's something to be (34:38 - 34:41)
probably pretty difficult with a level (34:40 - 34:42)
100 Le chunk (34:41 - 34:45)
I mean they're like (34:42 - 34:47)
it's the same thing it's like why can't (34:45 - 34:49)
I bring four healers to a dungeon well (34:47 - 34:51)
because (34:49 - 34:53)
you can't right like that isn't that (34:51 - 34:55)
isn't how the game is designed plus they (34:53 - 34:59)
did build content for you where you can (34:55 - 35:02)
do that there is a separate place for (34:59 - 35:05)
you to be able to do that but not on (35:02 - 35:09)
other people's dime right yeah I I think (35:05 - 35:12)
the the problem is like (35:09 - 35:15)
wasting everyone else's time right like (35:12 - 35:17)
like we we had a we had a raid where (35:15 - 35:19)
somebody (35:17 - 35:21)
um joined and they had 20 seconds left (35:19 - 35:24)
and they gosh I can't remember the first (35:21 - 35:26)
Pokemon they had but it was a very bad (35:24 - 35:28)
choice for decidueye and then they they (35:26 - 35:30)
switched to (35:28 - 35:33)
um flutter Maine which is also a very (35:30 - 35:35)
bad choice for deciduous since one (35:33 - 35:38)
flutter Mains week to Coast secondly (35:35 - 35:42)
flutter Maine's defense is like 55. it's (35:38 - 35:44)
so terrible (35:42 - 35:45)
and they were like this is the and they (35:44 - 35:47)
they said in chat they're like this is (35:45 - 35:50)
the best Pokemon I have and so like I I (35:47 - 35:54)
was like we can't we can't win (35:50 - 35:56)
um so I ended up attacking the flutter (35:54 - 35:59)
main just to end the raid faster (35:56 - 36:02)
like just like we we just need to like (35:59 - 36:04)
we cannot win this like the the (36:02 - 36:07)
decidueye is going to one shot you if he (36:04 - 36:10)
and I sometimes this is UI doesn't make (36:07 - 36:13)
the the best decisions no but yeah (36:10 - 36:16)
sometimes the NPC is like you and it's (36:13 - 36:17)
like this is the most useless move you (36:16 - 36:18)
have in this raid why are you here (36:17 - 36:21)
whatever (36:18 - 36:23)
like I watched this did you buy Swords (36:21 - 36:25)
Dance and then air cutter twice yeah I (36:23 - 36:27)
saw that I didn't have to be once there (36:25 - 36:29)
was a time but there's a time like I was (36:27 - 36:33)
at a raid in Final Fantasy 14 where (36:29 - 36:37)
uh there is a specific Manic Mechanic in (36:33 - 36:39)
one of the raids where a bomb is placed (36:37 - 36:41)
on the tank (36:39 - 36:44)
so they are bummed and they have to run (36:41 - 36:46)
away from the boss and everybody else (36:44 - 36:49)
because the bomb is gonna go off (36:46 - 36:50)
and (36:49 - 36:53)
raids take 45 minutes right it's a long (36:50 - 36:57)
series of bosses and their priest friend (36:53 - 36:59)
thought it would be funny (36:57 - 37:02)
to pull with the priest move the tank (36:59 - 37:05)
into the group of everybody (37:02 - 37:08)
killing us all (37:05 - 37:08)
and that's why teamwork works right (37:08 - 37:13)
and then they were surprised when they (37:11 - 37:16)
when the vote went up to kick them from (37:13 - 37:19)
the raid and then seven people reported (37:16 - 37:21)
them to the game devs saying don't let (37:19 - 37:24)
them don't let them join raids because (37:21 - 37:26)
it all like (37:24 - 37:29)
it's already 45 minutes of my time with (37:26 - 37:32)
a bunch of strangers and then you just (37:29 - 37:34)
think that's funny and cute to literally (37:32 - 37:37)
Force us to restart a fight that we are (37:34 - 37:39)
eight minutes into to relive another (37:37 - 37:44)
eight minutes for no reason it is just (37:39 - 37:48)
it's cute and funny to you but I (37:44 - 37:50)
guarantee you to maybe one other person (37:48 - 37:52)
who watched that on YouTube everybody (37:50 - 37:55)
else who was in that was having a (37:52 - 37:58)
miserable time and they don't like you (37:55 - 38:00)
and they are trying to figure out how do (37:58 - 38:03)
I never how do I ban this person how do (38:00 - 38:05)
I block them how do I never have to see (38:03 - 38:07)
them in anything I ever do again because (38:05 - 38:10)
that wasn't fun for me that could have (38:07 - 38:13)
been my one time to do this raid and I (38:10 - 38:16)
lost it it ruined my it is like well I (38:13 - 38:17)
don't want to do silver rates because (38:16 - 38:21)
people like this exist like it is just (38:17 - 38:24)
it's fine to do it with your friends if (38:21 - 38:26)
your friends want to do that and you (38:24 - 38:27)
want to see how it works (38:26 - 38:30)
perfect if you're doing it to random (38:27 - 38:31)
people (38:30 - 38:34)
that is a garbage garbage move (38:31 - 38:36)
yeah the nice thing at least about the (38:34 - 38:38)
Pokemon stuff is (38:36 - 38:41)
the the more you die (38:38 - 38:44)
because they print down that timer real (38:41 - 38:47)
fast (38:44 - 38:47)
yeah I again I think (38:49 - 38:54)
I'm curious to see what the next seven (38:53 - 38:58)
star is I I think I think overall this (38:54 - 39:01)
is a good direction (38:58 - 39:04)
um for Pokemon I think raids in general (39:01 - 39:06)
were a good direction for Pokemon yes uh (39:04 - 39:09)
yeah I would that's kind of one of the (39:06 - 39:12)
small one of the many small but many (39:09 - 39:15)
reasons I didn't like bdsp it just (39:12 - 39:17)
there was it was missing like that Co-op (39:15 - 39:19)
content that scarlet and violet and uh (39:17 - 39:21)
sword and shield had with like raid (39:19 - 39:23)
stuff I mean running around in a circle (39:21 - 39:25)
being like Exclamation point Exclamation (39:23 - 39:27)
point was pretty okay but like I don't (39:25 - 39:29)
know hallway simulator and bdsd didn't (39:27 - 39:31)
do it for me (39:29 - 39:31)
and having a big Co-op thing is a great (39:32 - 39:39)
Direction I do think they need to (39:35 - 39:39)
yeah I don't understand their (39:42 - 39:47)
I don't I don't know like like they're I (39:47 - 39:53)
get that Pokemon like loves like mystery (39:51 - 39:56)
and like like even if you go to like (39:53 - 39:58)
Pokemon go it's like (39:56 - 40:00)
the the the mystery of like what's (39:58 - 40:02)
what's in your egg because it's (40:00 - 40:04)
different than the main Series games of (40:02 - 40:05)
like you know what's in the egg because (40:04 - 40:06)
you (40:05 - 40:09)
put the two Pokemon in you you made that (40:06 - 40:12)
egg but like I I think the the exciting (40:09 - 40:15)
mystery is like the Pokemon's move set (40:12 - 40:17)
like that's that's like what is it going (40:15 - 40:19)
to have is it gonna have sword dance is (40:17 - 40:20)
it gonna have nasty plot is it gonna (40:19 - 40:22)
have Spirit check or Shadow Ball low (40:20 - 40:25)
kicks low sweep like yeah the mystery (40:22 - 40:27)
shouldn't be the people on your team (40:25 - 40:31)
yeah but also like the mystery part is (40:27 - 40:35)
for a select group of people who want to (40:31 - 40:39)
go in blind yeah and a male like EV is (40:35 - 40:42)
happens every time a new dungeon is (40:39 - 40:45)
released in almost every game there's a (40:42 - 40:47)
set group of people who will Who will (40:45 - 40:50)
literally say I'm going in blind this is (40:47 - 40:52)
my first run and I haven't looked at (40:50 - 40:53)
anything (40:52 - 40:56)
and then there's the majority of people (40:53 - 40:58)
are like well I watched all the videos (40:56 - 40:59)
so I know what's happening I just don't (40:58 - 41:02)
know how to execute it in game because I (40:59 - 41:03)
needed to know what's happening because (41:02 - 41:08)
I don't I don't want to have to learn (41:03 - 41:11)
this on the Fly because that's not fun (41:08 - 41:12)
for me (41:11 - 41:14)
so like there is a core group people (41:12 - 41:17)
that can go in blind but I don't think (41:14 - 41:20)
necessarily telling you what level it is (41:17 - 41:24)
or what level you should be is is (41:20 - 41:26)
ruining that experience of going in (41:24 - 41:28)
blind because you still don't know what (41:26 - 41:30)
the Pokemon is going to do what moveset (41:28 - 41:32)
it has even the return order like giving (41:30 - 41:34)
a little shocked that it didn't open up (41:32 - 41:36)
with two different things (41:34 - 41:37)
like (41:36 - 41:39)
that (41:37 - 41:41)
and there's a lot of people who won't do (41:39 - 41:42)
these rates until the second weekend (41:41 - 41:44)
because of that they want to see what it (41:42 - 41:47)
was so they can prepare so that they can (41:44 - 41:49)
do it quickly and have a better use of (41:47 - 41:51)
their time it's it (41:49 - 41:54)
I don't know necessarily (41:51 - 41:57)
why they make the decisions or like this (41:54 - 42:00)
that corporate think of like this is how (41:57 - 42:01)
we think things are fun it's like (42:00 - 42:03)
niantic's whole thing about only walking (42:01 - 42:06)
is fun and you should only ever walk (42:03 - 42:08)
um get those legs moving get those legs (42:06 - 42:10)
like when they get locked into like a (42:08 - 42:13)
corporate idea of like that and and just (42:10 - 42:16)
convince themselves that this is the (42:13 - 42:17)
only Viewpoint I think things generally (42:16 - 42:19)
suffer because you could make minor (42:17 - 42:22)
tweaks preserve that Viewpoint and still (42:19 - 42:25)
meet the needs of other people (42:22 - 42:25)
but what if you were a level 54 (42:28 - 42:32)
Berserker I mean I should be able to do (42:29 - 42:33)
it I did it with four back Excalibur but (42:32 - 42:35)
I don't have a switch anymore because it (42:33 - 42:36)
melted (42:35 - 42:38)
all right uh let's take a quick break (42:36 - 42:39)
when we come back we're gonna talk about (42:38 - 42:41)
the 3DS eShop uh technically the Wii U (42:39 - 42:45)
but no no one bought that console I have (42:41 - 42:47)
it mine was stolen all right we will be (42:45 - 42:48)
all right (42:47 - 42:53)
stolen we will be right back (42:48 - 42:53)
and we are back from our break (42:55 - 43:00)
uh (42:59 - 43:05)
uh Hey the Wii U and 3DS eshops are (43:00 - 43:08)
closing that's a thing (43:05 - 43:12)
my bank ceases to function forever no (43:08 - 43:14)
they they well we don't have information (43:12 - 43:16)
on that yet yeah so that's the thing (43:14 - 43:19)
here I gotta be honest I thought the (43:16 - 43:22)
eShop shut down at the startup here (43:19 - 43:25)
I was like why would you why would you (43:22 - 43:28)
have it in the middle of the year (43:25 - 43:30)
so this was news to me in the fact that (43:28 - 43:32)
I was like oh it's still up (43:30 - 43:36)
yeah the I I can see the confusion so (43:32 - 43:40)
March 27th it'll no longer be able you (43:36 - 43:42)
can't purchase anything anymore (43:40 - 43:44)
um uh you won't even be able to download (43:42 - 43:48)
free content uh so no game demos or (43:44 - 43:49)
anything like that so everything (43:48 - 43:51)
everything will should be shut down on (43:49 - 43:53)
March 27th (43:51 - 43:55)
you're probably thinking the confusing (43:53 - 43:59)
part is last year in May of 2022 you (43:55 - 44:03)
could no longer use a credit card to add (43:59 - 44:04)
funds (44:03 - 44:08)
and then as of August of last year you (44:04 - 44:11)
were no longer possible to use an eShop (44:08 - 44:13)
gift card (44:11 - 44:16)
to add funds (44:13 - 44:19)
um but you could still redeem download (44:16 - 44:23)
codes up to this point (44:19 - 44:25)
so if you have a digital download code (44:23 - 44:26)
for (44:25 - 44:29)
Super Smash Brothers 3DS probably (44:26 - 44:32)
probably should use that or if you have (44:29 - 44:35)
an account an eShop account shared with (44:32 - 44:37)
your newer devices and upload money to (44:35 - 44:39)
the eShop account on the newer devices (44:37 - 44:41)
you should be able to purchase things (44:39 - 44:46)
from the eShop on 3DS or Wii U (44:41 - 44:47)
um (44:46 - 44:49)
if that works for you it didn't work for (44:47 - 44:51)
me I think I may have switched eShop (44:49 - 44:54)
Accounts at some point um (44:51 - 44:54)
yeah and so we're recording this podcast (44:55 - 45:00)
on the 19th it'll come out the 20th so (44:58 - 45:04)
it means exactly one week to go uh we (45:00 - 45:06)
have no clue what's happening with (45:04 - 45:09)
Pokemon bank or Pokemon transporter or (45:06 - 45:12)
the future of Pokemon games being (45:09 - 45:17)
accessible in the future in general (45:12 - 45:19)
now the eShop is closing so (45:17 - 45:20)
realistically (45:19 - 45:24)
you could still wonder trade surprise (45:20 - 45:25)
trade I don't know when they changed the (45:24 - 45:27)
name you could still do that in like (45:25 - 45:32)
Ultra Sun Ultra Moon yeah back then so (45:27 - 45:37)
yeah we have we have no details of (45:32 - 45:41)
what is the future of Pokemon bank and (45:37 - 45:43)
Pokemon transporter except the one time (45:41 - 45:46)
they said that don't worry it will still (45:43 - 45:47)
work after the fact but that doesn't (45:46 - 45:51)
answer any questions for people who like (45:47 - 45:54)
I don't know like I I kind of feel like (45:51 - 45:56)
the Pokemon company maybe hopefully this (45:54 - 45:57)
week should (45:56 - 46:02)
remind people to get this yeah (45:57 - 46:04)
but also how many people are gonna like (46:02 - 46:07)
panic and get it and then give it five (46:04 - 46:10)
dollars for it to be theoretically free (46:07 - 46:12)
it's very hard for to give it five (46:10 - 46:14)
dollars (46:12 - 46:14)
how are you gonna give it five dollars I (46:14 - 46:20)
forgot to renew home yep (46:17 - 46:22)
and I for a hot second was like I'm (46:20 - 46:25)
gonna let it go but that it gave me this (46:22 - 46:27)
sad message of there are 2 000 Pokemon (46:25 - 46:30)
without a home right now (46:27 - 46:34)
am I fine (46:30 - 46:34)
um I saw I saw an article that it was (46:35 - 46:39)
really funny it was like I don't even (46:37 - 46:41)
remember what Outlet it was but it was (46:39 - 46:43)
like Pokemon games are the top most (46:41 - 46:46)
downloaded on the eShop as closure is (46:43 - 46:48)
like around the corner and I was like (46:46 - 46:51)
but but they've always been the tough (46:48 - 46:53)
case (46:51 - 46:56)
but this is a new top (46:53 - 46:58)
this is pretty sure (46:56 - 47:01)
levels Pokemon Crystal has been like (46:58 - 47:04)
number one or number two most downloaded (47:01 - 47:06)
in the eShop since it came out on the (47:04 - 47:08)
eShop I don't think anything has (47:06 - 47:10)
dethroned it which like makes sense like (47:08 - 47:11)
crystal is the one that gets you a (47:10 - 47:13)
Celebi it's like (47:11 - 47:15)
better than gold and silver and if you (47:13 - 47:19)
can only buy one of them crystals (47:15 - 47:19)
um (47:21 - 47:25)
and then I also saw uh (47:22 - 47:27)
uh I think it's the game completionist (47:25 - 47:30)
they bought every single eShop game and (47:27 - 47:33)
every single Wii U game on a (47:30 - 47:35)
I think the Wii U was like 1.2 terabytes (47:33 - 47:37)
I don't know how big the eShop stuff was (47:35 - 47:40)
but or the the 3DS stuff was (47:37 - 47:42)
but they bought it all to like donate it (47:40 - 47:44)
to a museum for like game preservation (47:42 - 47:47)
which is like really cool (47:44 - 47:49)
um also it was like a lot of money (47:47 - 47:53)
to purchase every game good or bad yeah (47:49 - 47:55)
I did not see the reason they they did (47:53 - 47:57)
it other than to just uh match their (47:55 - 47:59)
name of the completionists (47:57 - 48:02)
yeah uh well I'm sure the YouTube video (47:59 - 48:04)
ad Revenue would pay for it but I (48:02 - 48:06)
believe their their final goal was to (48:04 - 48:07)
donate it to a museum for game (48:06 - 48:08)
preservation (48:07 - 48:10)
which is cool (48:08 - 48:13)
uh I think game preservation is is super (48:10 - 48:16)
important I I (48:13 - 48:20)
think it's weird I like we live in a (48:16 - 48:23)
digital age where servers can't I mean (48:20 - 48:24)
Nintendo probably has money to make (48:23 - 48:28)
these servers last forever but like (48:24 - 48:31)
honestly who was still downloading or (48:28 - 48:32)
buying 3DS games in the last couple (48:31 - 48:34)
years I mean some people were right but (48:32 - 48:38)
like not nearly small amount yeah (48:34 - 48:41)
I'm not sure how much money it costs to (48:38 - 48:44)
host the store of thousands of digital (48:41 - 48:47)
games that need to be active in (48:44 - 48:48)
different currencies and countries and (48:47 - 48:50)
all that stuff like there is there's (48:48 - 48:53)
still money and maintenance and somebody (48:50 - 48:55)
they're pregnant to watch it it's less (48:53 - 48:57)
about the money and more about the (48:55 - 48:59)
maintenance (48:57 - 48:59)
that they don't necessarily want to put (48:59 - 49:03)
the money towards paying somebody to (49:01 - 49:05)
keep them maintaining an up-to-date in (49:03 - 49:07)
an ever-changing code world at some (49:05 - 49:09)
point it becomes very expensive (49:07 - 49:12)
to try to keep everything up to date and (49:09 - 49:13)
they'll just be like (49:12 - 49:15)
just let it go (49:13 - 49:18)
is dead (49:15 - 49:18)
so by the time the next podcast comes (49:18 - 49:22)
out (49:21 - 49:25)
both stores should be closed (49:22 - 49:27)
so I guess the takeaway from this news (49:25 - 49:29)
article is (49:27 - 49:32)
uh download Pokemon bank and Pokemon (49:29 - 49:36)
transporter it should still continue to (49:32 - 49:37)
work (49:36 - 49:40)
uh as these Pokemon said not in a 10 of (49:37 - 49:42)
the Pokemon said it should still work (49:40 - 49:45)
shoot that free yeah that's another key (49:42 - 49:48)
point it should be free they said free (49:45 - 49:51)
there's no way to pay for it otherwise (49:48 - 49:51)
um if you were to download any one thing (49:52 - 49:58)
dream Raider (49:55 - 50:00)
uh you know that was not my suggestion (49:58 - 50:02)
but (50:00 - 50:02)
so there is a handful of Pokemon games (50:03 - 50:07)
right there is red blue yellow gold (50:05 - 50:10)
silver Crystal (50:07 - 50:10)
my thought process is if you haven't (50:10 - 50:15)
downloaded them in the last two years (50:12 - 50:18)
maybe you don't need them I'm sure (50:15 - 50:20)
they'll come back eventually in some (50:18 - 50:23)
form of another some console one would (50:20 - 50:25)
hope (50:23 - 50:27)
there's one thing I know about the (50:25 - 50:31)
Pokemon company they love money yep (50:27 - 50:34)
and they love anything can't over (50:31 - 50:36)
related (50:34 - 50:39)
Nostalgia is powerful (50:36 - 50:41)
dream radar (50:39 - 50:44)
uh it's three dollars (50:41 - 50:48)
um it is a way to get (50:44 - 50:51)
I I would only suggest you getting dream (50:48 - 50:54)
radar if you have physical cartridge (50:51 - 50:55)
versions of like heart quotes soul (50:54 - 50:57)
silver diamond pearl Platinum uh it does (50:55 - 51:00)
do cool things with those games it gives (50:57 - 51:02)
you like otherwise a black and white as (51:00 - 51:03)
well because you need kind of black and (51:02 - 51:04)
white to move (51:03 - 51:07)
um if you don't have any of that stuff I (51:04 - 51:09)
don't think your three dollars is (51:07 - 51:10)
getting you any value of dreamwriter (51:09 - 51:13)
unless for the sake that you want it you (51:10 - 51:17)
get to meet the first instance of a (51:13 - 51:20)
future professor (51:17 - 51:20)
yeah you get to meet her before you meet (51:22 - 51:27)
her in alola it is the first shot you (51:24 - 51:31)
know if people save the pollen Halloween (51:27 - 51:33)
special simply because it was the first (51:31 - 51:35)
television appearance of kiss people (51:33 - 51:37)
should get dream radar because it's the (51:35 - 51:39)
first special appearance of Professor (51:37 - 51:42)
Burnett that's all I'm saying (51:39 - 51:44)
true murder has been out for 11 years if (51:42 - 51:46)
you haven't bought it by now (51:44 - 51:49)
that's understandable I think you would (51:46 - 51:52)
get more value out of a (51:49 - 51:55)
uh McDonald's doesn't even have a dollar (51:52 - 51:56)
menu anymore when you get the three (51:55 - 51:58)
dollars is more valuable in your bank (51:56 - 51:59)
account than maybe with dreamwriter (51:58 - 52:03)
unless all the banks are failing it's (51:59 - 52:04)
better stuffed in your mattress we're (52:03 - 52:06)
going back to the old depression days (52:04 - 52:08)
everybody (52:06 - 52:08)
uh yeah okay yeah so (52:09 - 52:17)
here's this is here's how you know how (52:13 - 52:20)
little Steve thinks of dream radar (52:17 - 52:23)
Steve's motto is money's no good in the (52:20 - 52:26)
bank and he is saying put it in the bank (52:23 - 52:29)
this is how you know Steve does not care (52:26 - 52:31)
about dream radar (52:29 - 52:34)
the the look I think dream radar is kind (52:31 - 52:35)
of cool except (52:34 - 52:38)
it was like one of those games that (52:35 - 52:40)
existed before (52:38 - 52:44)
mobile games streamlined stuff (52:40 - 52:48)
so like in order to unlock the things of (52:44 - 52:50)
dream radar there's like a timer in that (52:48 - 52:52)
game where it's like you could you only (52:50 - 52:54)
have so much energy to play for like (52:52 - 52:56)
five minutes and then you have to wait (52:54 - 52:59)
12 hours yeah so you literally have to (52:56 - 53:00)
play (52:59 - 53:03)
five minutes a day multiple times for (53:00 - 53:04)
like two weeks to actually unlock (53:03 - 53:08)
everything and the playing part is not (53:04 - 53:10)
enjoyable well you didn't like doing (53:08 - 53:13)
this you you literally have to like if (53:10 - 53:15)
you have a swiveling office chair you're (53:13 - 53:18)
playing (53:15 - 53:21)
your playing session is like swiveling (53:18 - 53:23)
in your office chair in a circle trying (53:21 - 53:26)
to catch like a routes floating in the (53:23 - 53:27)
sky it's not a great (53:26 - 53:30)
it's (53:27 - 53:33)
I will pay you three dollars not to play (53:30 - 53:34)
it because (53:33 - 53:37)
[Music] (53:34 - 53:39)
the only cool thing I think from dream (53:37 - 53:41)
radar again if you have if you put in a (53:39 - 53:44)
copy if you put in a copy of diamond you (53:41 - 53:47)
get like a special Dialga if you put in (53:44 - 53:50)
a copy of a heart a heart goal you get a (53:47 - 53:52)
special hoe it's not even that special I (53:50 - 53:54)
think it's just like a hoe in like a (53:52 - 53:55)
cherish ball I don't even think it's (53:54 - 53:57)
true it's you just get an extra Ho-Oh (53:55 - 54:00)
isn't it in a dream ball oh it might be (53:57 - 54:03)
yes dream balls because it's a dream (54:00 - 54:04)
whatever yes I think the five (54:03 - 54:07)
legendaries from gen four (54:04 - 54:09)
our entry balls yeah (54:07 - 54:13)
give Pokemon go a dollar I don't know a (54:09 - 54:15)
way easier experience (54:13 - 54:16)
um (54:15 - 54:18)
okay the actual thing you should (54:16 - 54:20)
download (54:18 - 54:24)
is the Sun and Moon demo (54:20 - 54:26)
that's the one thing if you're listening (54:24 - 54:28)
to this podcast this week (54:26 - 54:30)
go and download the Sun and Moon demo (54:28 - 54:34)
now that will ask for like 15 minutes of (54:30 - 54:36)
your time it's really not that bad of a (54:34 - 54:39)
15 minutes it's it's just it it it's the (54:36 - 54:41)
intro to Sun and Moon without the (54:39 - 54:43)
cutscenes there is some different (54:41 - 54:45)
dialogue actually there's probably more (54:43 - 54:47)
kahili dialogue in the Sun and Moon demo (54:45 - 54:49)
than in all of sudden moon (54:47 - 54:52)
is a character of surprise Elite Four (54:49 - 54:54)
member but anyways when you go through (54:52 - 54:56)
the Sun and Moon demo (54:54 - 55:00)
you get Ash Greninja at the end for free (54:56 - 55:02)
and it really like if even if you (55:00 - 55:04)
skipped all the dialogue into like the (55:02 - 55:06)
five battles against young goose that it (55:04 - 55:08)
requires you'd be done in like 10 (55:06 - 55:10)
minutes but there is some exclusive (55:08 - 55:13)
dialogue in that demo that wasn't in sun (55:10 - 55:15)
and moon like the demo was (55:13 - 55:18)
not just a first 15 minutes of sun and (55:15 - 55:22)
moon it was somewhat curated (55:18 - 55:24)
um and it's free and it gives you Ash (55:22 - 55:25)
Greninja and it's the only way to get (55:24 - 55:27)
Ash Greninja (55:25 - 55:30)
um there's no other way to get that so (55:27 - 55:33)
go can Ash Greninja go to home (55:30 - 55:36)
yes okay so I could just sit in your (55:33 - 55:38)
home forever and not be allowed in any (55:36 - 55:40)
other game technically you should be (55:38 - 55:42)
able to move it to scarlet and violet (55:40 - 55:45)
when home works out because they did (55:42 - 55:48)
Nerf battle Bond (55:45 - 55:48)
and why would they (55:49 - 55:53)
do that (55:51 - 55:55)
yeah there there shouldn't be any (55:53 - 55:57)
restrictions of moving Ash Greninja from (55:55 - 55:59)
home into (55:57 - 56:01)
but Ash Greninja has battle Bond and (55:59 - 56:04)
BattleBots not a breedable ability so (56:01 - 56:07)
um yeah you should do that you should (56:04 - 56:09)
look you just have to download it you (56:07 - 56:11)
don't even have to play it just go and (56:09 - 56:13)
download the Sun and Moon demo for free (56:11 - 56:17)
I think that's the only Pokemon demo (56:13 - 56:20)
mystery maybe there's a mystery dungeon (56:17 - 56:21)
demo (56:20 - 56:23)
um there was an Omega Ruby Alpha (56:21 - 56:25)
Sapphire demo (56:23 - 56:28)
but I remember what we got from it (56:25 - 56:30)
you didn't got anything (56:28 - 56:32)
I don't think you got anything either I (56:30 - 56:34)
think maybe you got like a 20 potions or (56:32 - 56:36)
something yeah (56:34 - 56:38)
yeah not worthwhile to wish Ash Greninja (56:36 - 56:41)
is so that's an easy go and download it (56:38 - 56:43)
for free you don't even have to worry (56:41 - 56:45)
about the whole payment mess that (56:43 - 56:48)
everything is in right now look if (56:45 - 56:49)
you're listening to this podcast and or (56:48 - 56:52)
you're and or your Bobby (56:49 - 56:54)
start plugging your 3DS right now (56:52 - 56:56)
because I know it's dead there's no (56:54 - 56:58)

all right this is uh this is off poke (59:04 - 59:09)
Beach uh a Pokemon judge receives a (59:06 - 59:11)
lifetime ban for harassing transgender (59:09 - 59:14)
players at a tournament (59:11 - 59:17)
uh this was a this was a pretty recent (59:14 - 59:19)
tournament uh this was back in Vancouver (59:17 - 59:20)
Pokemon company International (59:19 - 59:22)
permanently banned a certified judge for (59:20 - 59:25)
participating in the Pokemon in the (59:22 - 59:27)
Pokemon Community following transphobic (59:25 - 59:29)
Behavior towards a group of players at (59:27 - 59:32)
this past weekend's Vancouver regionals (59:29 - 59:33)
um (59:32 - 59:36)
according to player Elizabeth Barbara (59:33 - 59:38)
Barbara I'm sorry if I said your name (59:36 - 59:41)
wrong uh during the event a Texan (59:38 - 59:43)
Pokemon judge asked to take a selfie (59:41 - 59:44)
with her and a group of transgender (59:43 - 59:46)
players who were part of a competitive (59:44 - 59:50)
Pokemon TCG team called girl power he (59:46 - 59:51)
requested to step outside the event to (59:50 - 59:53)
ask them questions about the transgender (59:51 - 59:56)
Community he started off positive asking (59:53 - 59:58)
how Pokemon judge could judges could do (59:56 - 60:00)
more better and be more exclusive (59:58 - 60:05)
inclusive inclusive exclusive (60:00 - 60:05)
uh uh but quickly the conversation (60:06 - 60:11)
devolved the judge told each trans woman (60:09 - 60:15)
in our group how uh they they were born (60:11 - 60:18)
a boy or they have boyish builds (60:15 - 60:21)
Etc I don't think we need to go into all (60:18 - 60:24)
of that uh the more important part is (60:21 - 60:26)
the Players filed a complaint through (60:24 - 60:29)
Pokemon's official support system (60:26 - 60:32)
uh and literally later that day the uh (60:29 - 60:35)
judge was (60:32 - 60:38)
is the correct word fired band banned (60:35 - 60:39)
the correct word because they're pretty (60:38 - 60:41)
sure they're voluntary yeah yeah you're (60:39 - 60:43)
not kidding you're not gonna have a (60:41 - 60:44)
Pokemon judge at one point you're not (60:43 - 60:46)
getting paid for that (60:44 - 60:49)
and they were banned for life right yes (60:46 - 60:52)
yeah yeah I read I read the thing and as (60:49 - 60:54)
it went on I got more and more angry (60:52 - 60:57)
this yeah the oh yeah if you want to (60:54 - 60:59)
read the whole thing it's on Pokey Beach (60:57 - 61:02)
it's infuriating and I'm going to say (60:59 - 61:06)
one thing to all your listeners if you (61:02 - 61:11)
have the slightest thought about (61:06 - 61:14)
he didn't do anything wrong yes (61:11 - 61:17)
yes that yes no everything was wrong (61:14 - 61:19)
like (61:17 - 61:23)
minorities aren't your educators (61:19 - 61:26)
we aren't so if you like think oh I'll (61:23 - 61:28)
just go ask them a bunch of invasive (61:26 - 61:31)
questions that's a bad start don't ever (61:28 - 61:35)
do that if you find a person in your (61:31 - 61:37)
life that is willing to tolerate you (61:35 - 61:40)
asking the dumbest questions that could (61:37 - 61:41)
be looked up on Google (61:40 - 61:45)
buy that person dinner every day for a (61:41 - 61:47)
month because they are putting up with (61:45 - 61:47)
you (61:47 - 61:51)
it is not our job to educate you it is (61:47 - 61:55)
not up to us to make you a better person (61:51 - 61:58)
do that on your own time and do not do (61:55 - 62:01)
what this person did at all it is not it (61:58 - 62:05)
is not okay it is not right so don't and (62:01 - 62:08)
if you don't even think it didn't sound (62:05 - 62:11)
that bad it was that bad (62:08 - 62:11)
yeah good for the Pokemon company for (62:15 - 62:19)
taking action so absolutely (62:17 - 62:21)
I'm not sure we can say so quickly maybe (62:19 - 62:23)
it was so quickly that day but it did (62:21 - 62:24)
sound like that person had received (62:23 - 62:25)
complaints before (62:24 - 62:29)
yeah there is in there the potential (62:25 - 62:32)
that uh there was another complaint (62:29 - 62:35)
filed but I so that is a thing that is (62:32 - 62:38)
difficult in these situations because it (62:35 - 62:39)
is uncertain what happened with the (62:38 - 62:43)
first complaint generally you as a (62:39 - 62:46)
corporation say we're going to take (62:43 - 62:48)
we're going to lay out what needs to (62:46 - 62:50)
happen and you should never do this (62:48 - 62:54)
again because it's generally (62:50 - 62:57)
bad publicity to be like I always I was (62:54 - 62:59)
never told I had one infraction and then (62:57 - 63:01)
I was let go like that is generally a (62:59 - 63:04)
bad situation (63:01 - 63:06)
um so it's always hard to say like they (63:04 - 63:09)
were like how many complaints happened (63:06 - 63:10)
before in this case it does sound like (63:09 - 63:13)
there was perhaps only one which is (63:10 - 63:15)
usually is usually understood that an (63:13 - 63:16)
organization is going to sit down and (63:15 - 63:20)
say maybe you didn't know here's why (63:16 - 63:21)
that was all terrible and never ever (63:20 - 63:24)
ever do it again (63:21 - 63:24)
um (63:24 - 63:26)
so that that one's a little difficult (63:24 - 63:29)
but the I'm proud of them for like (63:26 - 63:30)
getting to complaint and that day being (63:29 - 63:31)
like (63:30 - 63:35)
saying bye bye-bye you're gone yeah (63:31 - 63:37)
um (63:35 - 63:37)
trans issues aside because there's a lot (63:38 - 63:42)
of them and I'm glad that this was (63:41 - 63:46)
resolved uh women in the Pokemon space (63:42 - 63:49)
already have it hard enough the amount (63:46 - 63:51)
of (63:49 - 63:55)
uh the amount of difficulty they have to (63:51 - 63:58)
go through is is it just (63:55 - 64:01)
so disheartening and so frustrating and (63:58 - 64:03)
uh like the last tournament I went to (64:01 - 64:07)
was the uh Milwaukee regionals (64:03 - 64:11)
and I think in the VGC aspect of it uh (64:07 - 64:13)
there were we had what like 300 players (64:11 - 64:15)
I think maybe only 10 of them were women (64:13 - 64:18)
it was like so much balance is always (64:15 - 64:22)
kind of absurd for such a huge event (64:18 - 64:22)
and uh (64:22 - 64:29)
my uh cat (64:25 - 64:31)
I remember my friend walking back from (64:29 - 64:33)
her first battle and was like yeah the (64:31 - 64:35)
dude I sat across from explain to me how (64:33 - 64:39)
my entire team worked I I know how my (64:35 - 64:42)
team worked I've I've been using it for (64:39 - 64:44)
several months and I was like I'm I'm (64:42 - 64:46)
sorry like (64:44 - 64:49)
I wish you would have won so that like (64:46 - 64:51)
they felt even worse after it just it (64:49 - 64:54)
just sucks yeah um (64:51 - 64:56)
so (64:54 - 64:58)
yeah the environment isn't isn't always (64:56 - 65:01)
great to begin with there are there is (64:58 - 65:05)
the added uh factors of every individual (65:01 - 65:08)
person who attends and what and the way (65:05 - 65:10)
they are acting but when a judge is (65:08 - 65:12)
acting this way that (65:10 - 65:16)
is a big issue that Pokemon has in their (65:12 - 65:19)
equal equality Equity diversity and (65:16 - 65:21)
inclusivity policy and they've had since (65:19 - 65:25)
2019 not to discriminate against gender (65:21 - 65:28)
gender identity gender reassignment or (65:25 - 65:30)
sexual orientation any of those things (65:28 - 65:33)
and then I think this year they added in (65:30 - 65:35)
their standards of conduct (65:33 - 65:38)
to not (65:35 - 65:40)
in in their respect section of their set (65:38 - 65:43)
of their standards of conduct to avoid (65:40 - 65:45)
dead naming or misgendering opponents (65:43 - 65:48)
things like that just straight up in (65:45 - 65:51)
their standards of conduct yep Pokemon (65:48 - 65:54)
has these rules to try to Foster an (65:51 - 65:55)
inclusive environment in a number of (65:54 - 65:58)
different ways but (65:55 - 66:00)
it it all comes down to the people who (65:58 - 66:03)
are there (66:00 - 66:03)
yeah (66:03 - 66:06)
I mean everybody's interesting like they (66:06 - 66:10)
do make a point in the article like (66:08 - 66:12)
this (66:10 - 66:16)
there should be as a person who was a (66:12 - 66:17)
trainer and still believes in training (66:16 - 66:20)
like when you become a with there should (66:17 - 66:24)
be a training that they should take as (66:20 - 66:28)
far as not only what you need to do to (66:24 - 66:32)
be a good judge but also there needs to (66:28 - 66:35)
always be some form of training to cover (66:32 - 66:39)
diversity you still need to inform a (66:35 - 66:42)
frighteningly a lot of people (66:39 - 66:46)
the basics of what it means to just be a (66:42 - 66:49)
decent person and respecting diversity (66:46 - 66:53)
and keeping your mouth shut (66:49 - 66:56)
um and I do I just sort of agree like (66:53 - 67:00)
there probably should be a there people (66:56 - 67:02)
don't get enough training as it is there (67:00 - 67:06)
should just in general be more of a (67:02 - 67:08)
quick take this online course that is (67:06 - 67:09)
going to cover situations that you've (67:08 - 67:12)
run into real situations (67:09 - 67:16)
and what you should do to handle them (67:12 - 67:18)
yeah I I don't even know what the (67:16 - 67:22)
questions are for the judge stuff when I (67:18 - 67:24)
when I took the judge thing which was (67:22 - 67:28)
gosh back back during black and white I (67:24 - 67:30)
remember any (67:28 - 67:33)
questions that were specifically toward (67:30 - 67:35)
there was like a couple like towards (67:33 - 67:36)
like (67:35 - 67:39)
maybe bully like like maybe one or two (67:36 - 67:41)
bully related questions but most of it (67:39 - 67:45)
was like technical game questions (67:41 - 67:49)
around like Pokey powers or abilities or (67:45 - 67:51)
they were still more focused on their (67:49 - 67:53)
game than their Community yeah their (67:51 - 67:55)
turn order and stuff uh and I was a (67:53 - 67:56)
Pokemon judge I think for like three (67:55 - 67:58)
years in a row you have to like take (67:56 - 68:00)
that quiz every (67:58 - 68:01)
year (68:00 - 68:03)
um to like Renew at least you used to (68:01 - 68:04)
again I haven't I haven't looked into (68:03 - 68:06)
the program and I remember all three (68:04 - 68:07)
years I took it it was like it's like (68:06 - 68:09)
the same (68:07 - 68:10)
questions (68:09 - 68:11)
um (68:10 - 68:13)
so I do know they added a bunch of other (68:11 - 68:15)
questions what did you say Hannah that (68:13 - 68:18)
was like 2019 (68:15 - 68:22)
uh 2019 was it sounds like when (68:18 - 68:26)
Lucidity policy was updated yeah (68:22 - 68:26)
um okay so to switch gears on a lighter (68:28 - 68:36)
note uh Pokemon Masters is getting a (68:32 - 68:38)
brand new character (68:36 - 68:44)
uh um ball guy is coming (68:38 - 68:44)
we should have not help for Mirror B one (68:45 - 68:49)
day (68:48 - 68:52)
one day I believe they announced this (68:49 - 68:56)
last night yeah it just happened yeah (68:53 - 68:58)
this is off Nintendo soup uh (68:56 - 69:00)
announcement of a series of events (68:58 - 69:02)
featuring bald guy a Pokeball mascot (69:00 - 69:04)
character introduced in sword and shield (69:02 - 69:06)
it will kick off the event Galler's (69:04 - 69:09)
Pokeball enthusiasts well which will (69:06 - 69:11)
introduce the sync pair ball guy and a (69:09 - 69:12)
Mungus (69:11 - 69:16)
uh it will start on March 21st and then (69:12 - 69:20)
there was a trailer for that (69:16 - 69:20)
sense doesn't somebody already have (69:22 - 69:26)
electrode yeah not not that that matters (69:24 - 69:29)
too much (69:26 - 69:29)
uh I think that's I think there's (69:29 - 69:33)
someone that has elected there may be (69:32 - 69:35)
others that have electrode it's (69:33 - 69:37)
but yeah I thought about that too and (69:35 - 69:38)
I'm like oh maybe they should give him (69:37 - 69:41)
hisuian (69:38 - 69:45)
electrode but oh yeah but no I'm gonna (69:41 - 69:47)
guess the other (69:45 - 69:50)
Pokeball hidden in the real they could (69:47 - 69:52)
have done galerian stun Fisk which I (69:50 - 69:53)
would also accept it I mean amungus is (69:52 - 69:55)
my favorite sword and shield Pokemon (69:53 - 70:00)
glarion stunt Fisk would have made Maybe (69:55 - 70:00)
I think uh (70:03 - 70:07)
full guy actually a fan fic character or (70:05 - 70:09)
do they just try really really really (70:07 - 70:13)
hard to make Fall Guy a fan favorite (70:09 - 70:16)
yeah people love (70:13 - 70:19)
it always feels awkward (70:16 - 70:22)
it is awkward it is (70:19 - 70:25)
awkward I love ball guy and it is (70:22 - 70:28)
awkward everything everything around (70:25 - 70:30)
ball guy is (70:28 - 70:32)
awkward (70:30 - 70:34)
do you you know what you know what's (70:32 - 70:36)
also slightly awkward (70:34 - 70:37)
um (70:36 - 70:39)
we're getting so much sword and shield (70:37 - 70:40)
stuff (70:39 - 70:43)
during scarlet and violet yeah like (70:40 - 70:45)
don't get me wrong the bead Marnie and (70:43 - 70:46)
hop (70:45 - 70:49)
gallerian bird outfits super great don't (70:46 - 70:52)
get me wrong bald guy super great why (70:49 - 70:54)
wasn't that stuff done during (70:52 - 70:59)
it's sword and shield it feels like (70:54 - 71:03)
there seems to be maybe a (70:59 - 71:07)
protection bubble around the story until (71:03 - 71:10)
it's done right like (71:07 - 71:12)
they kept them in reserve until (71:10 - 71:15)
everything was out for sword and shield (71:12 - 71:17)
and they were done like okay now you can (71:15 - 71:19)
play with them and invite them to The (71:17 - 71:20)
Kissing Simulator because we're we're (71:19 - 71:22)
not going to do anything more with them (71:20 - 71:24)
and I have a feeling that's gonna be the (71:22 - 71:25)
way it is for Scarlett by the way that's (71:24 - 71:27)
the two DLCs we won't see any of that (71:25 - 71:30)
added until (71:27 - 71:31)
later unless they're gonna do a special (71:30 - 71:34)
thing it it it I just feel like (71:31 - 71:38)
tape the Pokemon company puts them on (71:34 - 71:40)
like uh only only in super super special (71:38 - 71:42)
cases because we're not done with them (71:40 - 71:44)
yet list (71:42 - 71:47)
yeah I mean they did B and Alistair (71:44 - 71:48)
pretty (71:47 - 71:50)
pretty early (71:48 - 71:55)
yeah um and obviously Leon and stuff (71:50 - 71:57)
and I'm probably I'm probably I know (71:55 - 71:59)
Nessa got was there and I think Gordy (71:57 - 72:01)
yeah they do have a number of characters (71:59 - 72:04)
it's just these big main characters yeah (72:01 - 72:07)
and and ball guy (72:04 - 72:09)
um (72:07 - 72:09)
they're getting wild with their they're (72:09 - 72:12)
getting they're getting wild with their (72:11 - 72:15)
Partners I mean we got we got weird (72:12 - 72:18)
people being we have a tourist and a (72:15 - 72:20)
fashion designer that are just random (72:18 - 72:22)
NPCs that are now think pairs like (72:20 - 72:25)
they're just (72:22 - 72:25)
Butler was actually what did you battle (72:28 - 72:34)
him like twice you battle him somewhere (72:32 - 72:37)
he was actually like somewhat made sense (72:34 - 72:41)
they added the the post like I know a (72:37 - 72:42)
lot of people always say X and Y doesn't (72:41 - 72:45)
have any post game I mean it does uh (72:42 - 72:47)
they added the esper girl (72:45 - 72:50)
yeah yep they did I can't remember her (72:47 - 72:53)
name they added uh (72:50 - 72:57)
looker and Annabelle and (72:53 - 72:57)
esper girl s burger what is her name (72:58 - 73:05)
oh my gosh (73:02 - 73:07)
uh (73:05 - 73:09)
does she even have an esper no she has a (73:07 - 73:11)
crow bat which which like doesn't make (73:09 - 73:12)
sense unless you did the post game where (73:11 - 73:13)
she'd like (73:12 - 73:16)
has a crow bat I feel like like so many (73:13 - 73:18)
for whatever reason like (73:16 - 73:20)
the Trope of (73:18 - 73:23)
friendship in Pokemon is (73:20 - 73:26)
um yeah the Trope of Pokemon friendship (73:23 - 73:28)
is very high and the default Pokemon is (73:26 - 73:32)
just chroma yeah (73:28 - 73:32)
just Crobat (73:38 - 73:44)
well um it's for some reason they really (73:41 - 73:45)
like (73:44 - 73:48)
poison sink Bears (73:45 - 73:54)
I don't understand why because also a (73:48 - 73:58)
poison sick bear and I don't get it I (73:54 - 74:00)
don't get why there's such a weird focus (73:58 - 74:04)
on poison types and Masters (74:00 - 74:04)
yeah uh you know (74:06 - 74:10)
I I don't know I don't know if ball guy (74:11 - 74:18)
is enough to convince some people to (74:16 - 74:19)
play Masters (74:18 - 74:22)
I guess we'll see I mean if Hawkeye ends (74:19 - 74:23)
up at The Kissing Simulator that's gonna (74:22 - 74:27)
bring people in by the hordes (74:23 - 74:27)
yeah I mean sure ah I did (74:28 - 74:33)
you know I don't I don't think I don't (74:35 - 74:39)
think any news can top ball guy being (74:37 - 74:43)
added to Pokemon Masters so uh I think (74:39 - 74:46)
we'll wrap up there (74:43 - 74:49)
uh we'll again keep your eyes out for (74:46 - 74:51)
something related to the 3DS eShop (74:49 - 74:54)
closing this week hopefully oh gosh I (74:51 - 74:56)
hope I have some sort of communication (74:54 - 74:58)
yeah I hope by the time this podcast (74:56 - 74:59)
comes up there's there's something (74:58 - 75:03)
saying that (74:59 - 75:06)
download these or this is safe or this (75:03 - 75:09)
is our plan going forward or (75:06 - 75:11)
who knows I I honestly thought in the (75:09 - 75:13)
last year like the Pokemon company would (75:11 - 75:17)
release like a dedicated app to like (75:13 - 75:20)
replace home and or not home well I hope (75:17 - 75:23)
they replace them uh to replace bank and (75:20 - 75:25)
Transporters that's just like this is (75:23 - 75:27)
your one-way app just to send things to (75:25 - 75:30)
home to the Future because there's no (75:27 - 75:32)
point in storing them in Bank anymore (75:30 - 75:34)
like just give me a transporter app that (75:32 - 75:37)
skips the bank step and goes right to (75:34 - 75:38)
home (75:37 - 75:41)
and that didn't happen and that would be (75:38 - 75:43)
very foolish of them to release an app (75:41 - 75:44)
this week and be like all right you got (75:43 - 75:47)
one week did that like (75:44 - 75:47)
so again I don't (75:49 - 75:55)
I don't know like even even if they were (75:52 - 75:58)
to do can they even update Pokemon bank (75:55 - 76:02)
or like a transporter this week like it (75:58 - 76:05)
it would be risky but that would be wild (76:02 - 76:07)
it like it kind of is what it is at this (76:05 - 76:09)
point of (76:07 - 76:12)
the only thing I can think of is they (76:09 - 76:16)
could add an up an update to it that was (76:12 - 76:19)
like here like it will read your boxes (76:16 - 76:21)
and give you a QR code and then you can (76:19 - 76:23)
do that on your phone and transform that (76:21 - 76:25)
like I can see them doing that which (76:23 - 76:29)
they don't need too late for an update (76:25 - 76:33)
I think so too yeah probably and just (76:29 - 76:36)
bringing your Pokemon forward from the (76:33 - 76:38)
older games or playing the older games (76:36 - 76:40)
is kind of all in question right now (76:38 - 76:42)
I mean that's what I thought I thought (76:40 - 76:44)
the app I thought there would be an app (76:42 - 76:46)
or an update to the app that would just (76:44 - 76:49)
here's a QR code scan the QR code these (76:46 - 76:51)
Pokemon move over I don't know maybe I (76:49 - 76:54)
guess QR codes are not safe or secure or (76:51 - 76:57)
copy and paste to do a duplicate more I (76:54 - 77:00)
I don't know what the solution is (76:57 - 77:02)
but (77:00 - 77:02)
like I I I'm just going forward without (77:03 - 77:08)
a solution (77:05 - 77:08)
I know that there are (77:08 - 77:13)
a ton of people out there that want to (77:11 - 77:16)
move every single Pokemon forward myself (77:13 - 77:18)
included (77:16 - 77:22)
but I also know we are in the minority (77:18 - 77:24)
like there are just so many players out (77:22 - 77:26)
there that they don't care about moving (77:24 - 77:28)
like the Pokemon to them is they played (77:26 - 77:30)
from start to finish they got credits (77:28 - 77:32)
they moved on to a different game (77:30 - 77:34)
um (77:32 - 77:34)
but for the people who want to move (77:35 - 77:39)
forward that's a pretty important thing (77:37 - 77:42)
that has (77:39 - 77:44)
been a thing since Ruby and staff I mean (77:42 - 77:46)
technically before that but then they (77:44 - 77:48)
did that word separation thing (77:46 - 77:50)
um we want to play the old games and (77:48 - 77:52)
move things forward from the old games I (77:50 - 77:54)
mean I was one of the people who had (77:52 - 77:56)
moved pretty much everything forward (77:54 - 77:58)
from my old games but if I were to go (77:56 - 78:00)
back and Replay for any reason moving (77:58 - 78:02)
things forward from now on is going to (78:00 - 78:04)
get harder and harder (78:02 - 78:06)
yeah (78:04 - 78:08)
I mean it's kind of like it's kind of (78:06 - 78:09)
the reason I like to play old games (78:08 - 78:11)
because I know if I do a playthrough of (78:09 - 78:14)
you know leaf green I can move those (78:11 - 78:16)
Pokemon forward and be like this was my (78:14 - 78:18)
weird summer run of leaf green and these (78:16 - 78:20)
are the Pokemon I used now they're (78:18 - 78:22)
living in Pokemon home like I think (78:20 - 78:23)
that's cool (78:22 - 78:26)
um (78:23 - 78:26)
it's why I don't care about cartridge (78:26 - 78:31)
versions of red and blue because like I (78:28 - 78:32)
can't (78:31 - 78:35)
I can't do I can't move those forward (78:32 - 78:38)
also I I have bad eyes I can't play it (78:35 - 78:40)
virtual gameplay (78:38 - 78:42)
can't see that screen anymore I don't (78:40 - 78:46)
know how I saw that screen as a kid (78:42 - 78:46)
a lot of worm lights oh yeah (78:46 - 78:53)
uh we will be back next week uh some (78:50 - 78:56)
some stuff scheduled this week uh twitch (78:53 - 78:58)
is doing this big 64 person twitch (78:56 - 79:00)

trying to get through the game as fast (79:03 - 79:07)
as possible day two is taking the (79:05 - 79:09)
Pokemon you caught through your (79:07 - 79:11)
playthrough and trying to make a (79:09 - 79:12)
competitive team (79:11 - 79:16)

that is uh (79:39 - 79:42)
to keep animals in the wild and safe and (79:40 - 79:44)
all that stuff (79:42 - 79:47)
animal preservation I believe it's (79:44 - 79:48)
called Uh so we're gonna be raising (79:47 - 79:51)
money for that charity uh so that's (79:48 - 79:54)
