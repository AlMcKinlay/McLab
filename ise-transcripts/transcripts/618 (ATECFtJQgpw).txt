with me is Hannah I hi I&#39;m here um sorry (0:21 - 0:30)
I&#39;m tired uh and I was thinking about (0:27 - 0:32)
how Pokemon sleep makes me feel worse (0:30 - 0:33)
when I&#39;m tired cuz all my Pokemon are (0:32 - 0:35)
tired (0:33 - 0:36)
too I thought you were just going to say (0:35 - 0:38)
all my Pokemon were bad because I woke (0:36 - 0:41)
up to a bunch of bad Pokemon uh Bobby (0:38 - 0:46)
also here hey uh so this week I beat (0:41 - 0:47)
Echo the dolphin which was my (0:46 - 0:51)
accomplishment of the week yes it&#39;s (0:47 - 0:52)
wonderful is this your first time (0:51 - 0:55)
beating it it&#39;s my first time playing (0:52 - 0:58)
through the entire thing so I&#39;ve like (0:55 - 1:01)
used coach codes or something like back (0:58 - 1:03)
in the day to like get to the last level (1:01 - 1:05)
to beat it just to like see the end of (1:03 - 1:07)
it but this is the first time where I (1:05 - 1:08)
like fully played through the game and (1:07 - 1:11)
beat it all uh on the switch on the (1:08 - 1:17)
switch online uh store or got it thing (1:11 - 1:20)
yeah uh okay well we have an episode for (1:17 - 1:22)
yall today this is kind of weird because (1:20 - 1:24)
we already recorded next week&#39;s episode (1:22 - 1:28)
yesterday cuz I&#39;m going to I&#39;m when this (1:24 - 1:29)
episode goes up I&#39;m like literally (1:28 - 1:33)
leaving in Japan for in like 24 hours so (1:29 - 1:34)
bit stressed about that because I&#39;m (1:33 - 1:36)
trying to get things (1:34 - 1:39)
done before I leave so I&#39;m not spending (1:36 - 1:42)
my time in Japan in the hotel like (1:39 - 1:45)
furiously editing or doing some other (1:42 - 1:47)
things that like take away from the the (1:45 - 1:51)
Japan experience um so we we do have a (1:47 - 1:53)
uh do have some news not like anything (1:51 - 1:57)
crazy breaking news but uh the Pokemon (1:53 - 2:00)
train just keeps on chugging so we got (1:57 - 2:02)
stuff uh By the time this episode goes (2:00 - 2:06)
up ente week will start and you guys (2:02 - 2:08)
were already before I got here you guys (2:06 - 2:11)
were already talking ente strategy just (2:08 - 2:15)
a little bit Yeah are are are we (2:11 - 2:18)
ready I still need to build a team yeah (2:15 - 2:21)
I mean I&#39;ve built a team but it&#39;s it&#39;s (2:18 - 2:24)
not like a great team you know yeah (2:21 - 2:27)
you&#39;re still trying to get a syndic Quil (2:24 - 2:28)
still trying to get a syndic Quil trying (2:27 - 2:29)
to get a better syndic Quil or really (2:28 - 2:32)
just want a very finding syndic Quil uh (2:29 - 2:35)
but yeah other than that yeah everything (2:32 - 2:38)
else is is together but things could use (2:35 - 2:39)
some leveling (2:38 - 2:42)
up it&#39;s fine (2:39 - 2:45)
though there&#39;s a point where I you&#39;re (2:42 - 2:48)
you&#39;re there&#39;s a point where you are at (2:45 - 2:49)
Bobby where you feel like you have too (2:48 - 2:51)
many dream (2:49 - 2:53)
shards probably or like wow I&#39;ll never (2:51 - 2:55)
run out of dream shards and then it (2:53 - 2:58)
dramatically will change especially when (2:55 - 3:00)
they have one of those events where you (2:58 - 3:02)
can use the dream shards to make the (3:00 - 3:06)
candy worth more right right I I will (3:02 - 3:08)
say I don&#39;t I didn&#39;t go hard enough on (3:06 - 3:11)
that uh two weeks ago like looking back (3:08 - 3:12)
on it but there like a lot of the (3:11 - 3:14)
Pokemon that I ended up getting that I (3:12 - 3:16)
want on my team I didn&#39;t get toward (3:14 - 3:18)
until toward the end of the week yeah so (3:16 - 3:20)
that was they should have made the thing (3:18 - 3:22)
last two weeks they should have had it (3:20 - 3:24)
go through this week and then we get (3:22 - 3:26)
ente week starting you (3:24 - 3:32)
know I still don&#39;t have I think like I (3:26 - 3:36)
said two weeks ago I think like the two (3:32 - 3:38)
best Pokemon you could probably have in (3:36 - 3:42)
this event will probably be Charizard (3:38 - 3:43)
and in my opinion (3:42 - 3:45)
Flareon because especially if you&#39;re a (3:43 - 3:47)
freet to-play player because you&#39;re not (3:45 - 3:50)
going to pay for the even if you are on (3:47 - 3:52)
the monthly (3:50 - 3:54)
subscription good camp ticket only will (3:52 - 3:59)
give you one week of these two weeks mhm (3:54 - 4:01)
um so unless you want to spend $10 for (3:59 - 4:02)
the second week because that&#39;s literally (4:01 - 4:04)
how much a good camp ticket costs is 10 (4:02 - 4:10)
bucks MH uh to increase your pot size (4:04 - 4:13)
would definitely accelerate your rank (4:10 - 4:15)
that&#39;s what Flareon would do and since (4:13 - 4:17)
Charizard gets you a bunch of (4:15 - 4:20)
ingredients that&#39;s good too but if (4:17 - 4:21)
Charizard is getting you a bunch of (4:20 - 4:22)
ingredients and you have a really small (4:21 - 4:26)
pot that&#39;s not helpful at (4:22 - 4:32)
all uh did I find an Eevee this week no (4:26 - 4:32)
so I have to like now pick between like (4:32 - 4:39)
four pretty mediocre EES they&#39;re like (4:35 - 4:43)
not the worst EES but like okay um one (4:39 - 4:45)
of them has to evolve at this point I (4:43 - 4:47)
was hoping that like at some point I (4:45 - 4:50)
would get a good one you&#39;ll get it to (4:47 - 4:52)
level 25 and you&#39;ll forget forget about (4:50 - 4:54)
it eventually yeah yeah that I already (4:52 - 4:56)
did the math I was like okay it&#39;s all (4:54 - 4:59)
it&#39;ll be good for 25 it&#39;ll be fine it&#39;s (4:56 - 5:02)
like main scale up but no skill trigger (4:59 - 5:04)
but that&#39;s (5:02 - 5:07)
okay um I know as soon as I evolve one I (5:04 - 5:09)
go I&#39;ll go into the store I&#39;ll buy the (5:07 - 5:11)
Firestone the one will show up like (5:09 - 5:13)
naturally and it&#39;ll be better like I (5:11 - 5:15)
wasted all those points that&#39;s how it (5:13 - 5:19)
goes that&#39;s just that&#39;s just the laws of (5:15 - 5:21)
anything at least Eevee is one of those (5:19 - 5:23)
ones that you can get candy for (5:21 - 5:27)
relatively easily yeah (5:23 - 5:30)
yeah um there are Pokemon that are (5:27 - 5:32)
relatively easy still don&#39;t have a good (5:30 - 5:35)
Vulpix I think I got a pretty good (5:32 - 5:37)
Vulpix this morning but it it still (5:35 - 5:39)
doesn&#39;t seem that (5:37 - 5:42)
useful and I feel kind of bad about it (5:39 - 5:43)
does it have corn cuz I feel like if it (5:42 - 5:47)
had corn then yes it would be I think it (5:43 - 5:50)
might let&#39;s see we&#39;ll pick this number (5:47 - 5:53)
37 in the Pokedex cor wouldn&#39;t be to (5:50 - 5:55)
level 30 though right it doesn&#39;t like (5:53 - 5:57)
start off with corn no it doesn&#39;t start (5:55 - 5:59)
with corn but you can get double corn on (5:57 - 6:01)
it it has all three of the ingredients (5:59 - 6:04)
so beans corn and potatoes it has (6:01 - 6:07)
helping speed s skill trigger s (6:04 - 6:09)
ingredient finder s Berry finding s but (6:07 - 6:11)
that&#39;s level (6:09 - 6:14)
75 so we&#39;ll see that in about two years (6:11 - 6:16)
and ingredient Finder M with a main (6:14 - 6:19)
skill chance up so I was feeling pretty (6:16 - 6:22)
good about that Vulpix overall yeah yeah (6:19 - 6:24)
yeah that doesn&#39;t seem (6:22 - 6:26)
terrible I mean the the thing about (6:24 - 6:29)
Pokemon sleep is like you could use this (6:26 - 6:31)
Vulpix during the week that it will (6:29 - 6:34)
matter or you could spend the next six (6:31 - 6:38)
months still trying to find a good (6:34 - 6:41)
Vex that&#39;s why I always like hate the (6:38 - 6:43)
rals argument of everyone just being (6:41 - 6:46)
like don&#39;t do this just save it save (6:43 - 6:48)
everything for rals okay one you have to (6:46 - 6:51)
have lapis open two you have to go to (6:48 - 6:54)
lapis and all these events take you away (6:51 - 6:56)
from lapis and number three I&#39;ve had (6:54 - 6:58)
lapis (6:56 - 7:01)
on I have zero good (6:58 - 7:04)
routs (7:01 - 7:07)
yeah yeah getting a good Pokemon is (7:04 - 7:08)
sometimes rarer than getting a Shiny (7:07 - 7:12)
Pokemon in this game yeah I I would I (7:08 - 7:15)
would agree with that mhm I the game has (7:12 - 7:17)
Totodile has been in the game since (7:15 - 7:19)
launch it has been relatively easy to (7:17 - 7:22)
get do I have a good tood yet (7:19 - 7:25)
[Laughter] (7:22 - 7:29)
no and that one&#39;s like easy to (7:25 - 7:32)
get speaking of shinies though it did (7:29 - 7:36)
take it took 52 sleep sessions before I (7:32 - 7:38)
finally got a Shiny Pokemon and it was (7:36 - 7:41)
Cubone and then literally within the (7:38 - 7:44)
next five sleep sessions I got a shiny (7:41 - 7:47)
Marowak so that Line&#39;s complete I guess (7:44 - 7:50)
sounds about I was trying for that uh (7:47 - 7:54)
was weird not terrible in the game yeah (7:50 - 7:55)
I mean the and the Cubone I&#39;ve been (7:54 - 7:57)
using the Cubone this week it&#39;s fine (7:55 - 7:59)
like it more so just using it cuz it&#39;s (7:57 - 8:00)
shiny (7:59 - 8:04)
than anything else but you know it is (8:00 - 8:08)
what it is I have like a B minus pseudo (8:04 - 8:11)
woodo that is shiny and it&#39;s like that&#39;s (8:08 - 8:13)
that&#39;s good (8:11 - 8:16)
enough it&#39;s above average it&#39;s shiny (8:13 - 8:19)
I&#39;ll invest (8:16 - 8:22)
yeah I just like let me use some of my (8:19 - 8:23)
shinies (8:22 - 8:26)
please I have like a I have like an F (8:23 - 8:29)
tier shiny bell sprout it is like the (8:26 - 8:31)
worst possible like Bells sprout in the (8:29 - 8:34)
entire everything is like the worst on (8:31 - 8:37)
it but it can be your icon so that&#39;s (8:34 - 8:38)
what (8:37 - 8:40)
matters that&#39;s true I haven&#39;t changed my (8:38 - 8:43)
icon to uh either of the shiny Pokemon (8:40 - 8:46)
that I&#39;ve caught (8:43 - 8:49)
so I (8:46 - 8:56)
my flight is at 11:00 a.m. and my (8:49 - 9:00)
plan is to (8:56 - 9:03)
not sleep Monday night into Tuesday so (9:00 - 9:05)
then I can sleep on the (9:03 - 9:08)
plane I don&#39;t know how the Pokeball (9:05 - 9:11)
Plus+ would work because I I don&#39;t think (9:08 - 9:15)
I could get 10 minutes of no movement oh (9:11 - 9:19)
yeah you&#39;ve tried that before I think (9:15 - 9:20)
yeah the problem with what I tried (9:19 - 9:23)
before is I tried to sink it while still (9:20 - 9:26)
on the plane and the internet oh yeah no (9:23 - 9:28)
you can&#39;t yeah the internet was not good (9:26 - 9:30)
enough so I do want to try again (9:28 - 9:32)
but like okay I&#39;ll sink as soon as we (9:30 - 9:35)
like land and I have like good (9:32 - 9:39)
service but I I don&#39;t know I like if I (9:35 - 9:41)
press the button and then like put it in (9:39 - 9:43)
the Sleep pocket of the the gross sleep (9:41 - 9:46)
pocket in front of the (9:43 - 9:48)
plane I just don&#39;t know if that&#39;s (9:46 - 9:51)
like obviously turbulence would for sure (9:48 - 9:56)
set it off correct yeah yes but if we&#39;re (9:51 - 9:59)
coasting is that enough of nonm movement (9:56 - 10:01)
for 10 minutes I think that might depend (9:59 - 10:04)
on how it&#39;s programmed yeah yeah just (10:01 - 10:08)
because it&#39;s definitely sensing movement (10:04 - 10:10)
there because of the accelerometer I (10:08 - 10:13)
would assume right also is it smart (10:10 - 10:14)
enough to know like you&#39;re not in the (10:13 - 10:16)
same location we&#39;ve seen you (10:14 - 10:19)
travel that shouldn&#39;t it doesn&#39;t have a (10:16 - 10:22)
GPS or do you mean it does know that (10:19 - 10:25)
it&#39;s it does know that it&#39;s moved so but (10:22 - 10:26)
I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll you&#39;re going like (10:25 - 10:29)
500 Miles hour (10:26 - 10:31)
you can&#39;t be sleeping you&#39;re moving at (10:29 - 10:33)
500 miles per hour right (10:31 - 10:36)
now no but I I&#39;ve definitely started (10:33 - 10:40)
it uh at my house like oh I&#39;m going to (10:36 - 10:43)
sleep I started it and then I like went (10:40 - 10:45)
I was like okay I guess I&#39;m not sleeping (10:43 - 10:46)
anymore I&#39;m not tired so I like took it (10:45 - 10:48)
to a coffee shop with me cuz I was like (10:46 - 10:50)
ah it&#39;s like 6 a.m. coffee Shop&#39;s open (10:48 - 10:53)
and then I took it back home right after (10:50 - 10:56)
I was done and then it said like we (10:53 - 10:58)
stopped recording data because you you (10:56 - 11:00)
moved your area (10:58 - 11:02)
like it it I would need to see a (11:00 - 11:05)
screenshot of that ER I&#39;m not lying (11:02 - 11:07)
about (11:05 - 11:09)
it but you kept that hold on a second (11:07 - 11:11)
this is the thing I&#39;m wondering you kept (11:09 - 11:13)
it sleeping even though you got up and (11:11 - 11:15)
went to a coffee (11:13 - 11:17)
shop I didn&#39;t want to I didn&#39;t want to (11:15 - 11:18)
break my sleep (11:17 - 11:22)
cycle got to get that 100 yeah you got (11:18 - 11:24)
to get 100 I&#39;ve never gotten 100 before (11:22 - 11:25)
I&#39;ve never gotten a sleep score above (11:24 - 11:27)
like uh 802 you&#39;re not pregaming (11:25 - 11:29)
properly then I&#39;m not what you&#39;re not (11:27 - 11:33)
pregaming or just not sleeping (11:29 - 11:33)
enough we&#39;ve known this if you listen to (11:35 - 11:40)
this podcast you know I don&#39;t sleep (11:38 - 11:41)
proper people probably think it&#39;s like (11:40 - 11:43)
oh man Steve gets so much sleep because (11:41 - 11:46)
it&#39;s always a 100 no I just (11:43 - 11:50)
pregame I did like it woke I woke up (11:46 - 11:52)
this morning and it said I had it said I (11:50 - 11:54)
had nine hours of sleep and I was like I (11:52 - 11:57)
wish it was 9 hours realistically it was (11:54 - 12:00)
probably like six and a half oh wow I (11:57 - 12:04)
was in bed for maybe like eight of those (12:00 - 12:07)
hours okay that&#39;s that says something at (12:04 - 12:10)
least I mean mine are typically like (12:07 - 12:13)
five and a half hours five to five and a (12:10 - 12:16)
half hours of sleep each time so uh you (12:13 - 12:18)
know is what it is but I was thinking (12:16 - 12:22)
about your flight what if you took like (12:18 - 12:25)
something to put the go Plus+ in and (12:22 - 12:28)
then you taped it like to the top and (12:25 - 12:30)
bottom of that thing so it&#39;s suspended (12:28 - 12:34)
like inside of it but it&#39;s not like (12:30 - 12:35)
touching anything and then you just hold (12:34 - 12:37)
it for the first 10 minutes while you&#39;re (12:35 - 12:39)
moving and it might not move you&#39;re not (12:37 - 12:41)
getting rid of the problems it might not (12:39 - 12:43)
move enough though like if you if you do (12:41 - 12:47)
it in a way that suspended it&#39;s possible (12:43 - 12:50)
think I&#39;m getting like a gimbal for my (12:47 - 12:53)
pretty much yeah that exactly exactly (12:50 - 12:54)
that would help with some of the (12:53 - 12:56)
problems but not all of the problems you (12:54 - 12:58)
just need it for 10 minutes I mean you (12:56 - 13:00)
just need it to work for 10 minutes just (12:58 - 13:02)
pregame it before you get on the plane (13:00 - 13:04)
oh you might as well oh that&#39;s a good (13:02 - 13:10)
one there we go Hannah 800 IQ pregame (13:04 - 13:13)
before the plane yeah that&#39;s true then (13:10 - 13:14)
I&#39;m going to get the I&#39;m going to get (13:13 - 13:16)
the screenshot of like you moved you (13:14 - 13:18)
moved areas we&#39;re not tracking anymore I (13:16 - 13:20)
still don&#39;t believe you you can show it (13:18 - 13:21)
to us (13:20 - 13:24)
then this is a real thing I just think (13:21 - 13:27)
there was too much movement in in the (13:24 - 13:29)
plus plus I don&#39;t think it was was (13:27 - 13:31)
telling you you moved areas I don&#39;t (13:29 - 13:32)
think I believe it used the word (13:31 - 13:35)
location I will I will I will find it (13:32 - 13:37)
during the break or something somebody (13:35 - 13:38)
has a screenshot I&#39;m (13:37 - 13:40)
sure (13:38 - 13:46)
uh uh speaking of mobile games uh there (13:40 - 13:50)
was an article that just came out uh off (13:46 - 13:54)
Electronics H electronic hub.org and (13:50 - 13:57)
it&#39;s it&#39;s tit this was April 30th 2024 (13:54 - 13:59)
so relatively recently (13:57 - 14:03)

on 2 million (14:03 - 14:08)
reviews because this is a Pokemon (14:05 - 14:10)
podcast and now that I just read the (14:08 - 14:12)
headline of that (14:10 - 14:15)
article what game do you think is we&#39;re (14:12 - 14:18)
gonna talk about (14:15 - 14:18)
here I was talking to somebody recently (14:21 - 14:25)
and they were like do you think Niantic (14:24 - 14:27)
didn&#39;t send you to a go Fest cuz you (14:25 - 14:31)
badmouth them I&#39;m just reading the (14:27 - 14:35)
news it&#39;s Pokemon (14:31 - 14:38)
go this is where the game is at at this (14:35 - 14:40)
point that&#39;s where the game&#39;s been for (14:38 - 14:42)
eight years not (14:40 - 14:45)

Target and (15:20 - 15:25)
instacart instacart&#39;s a scam (15:21 - 15:29)
uh the top new top different topic (15:25 - 15:31)
[Laughter] (15:29 - 15:34)
the top most buggiest food and drink (15:31 - 15:38)
apps Taco Bell Wendy&#39;s and Sonic I can (15:34 - 15:40)
agree with this because for my Taco Bell (15:38 - 15:42)
app I have not been able to actually (15:40 - 15:47)
check out in the last week it just it I (15:42 - 15:49)
can I can I can put my whole order in my (15:47 - 15:51)
cart and then when you go to the (15:49 - 15:53)
checkout screen you like pick like Apple (15:51 - 15:56)
pay or credit card and then you have to (15:53 - 16:00)
pick either pickup or um (15:56 - 16:03)
it&#39;s like uh inore pickup or like (16:00 - 16:05)
drive-thru or something and none of (16:03 - 16:07)
those buttons will like highlight so (16:05 - 16:08)
because I can&#39;t pick any of those (16:07 - 16:12)
buttons I can&#39;t actually okay check out (16:08 - 16:13)
are you sure now I&#39;ve had some (16:12 - 16:15)
experience with this when it comes to (16:13 - 16:18)
Chipotle so and there&#39;s anything I&#39;m an (16:15 - 16:20)
expert in it is Chipotle Chipotle is not (16:18 - 16:22)
on the top 10 it shouldn&#39;t be it&#39;s a (16:20 - 16:24)
great app (16:22 - 16:27)
however I&#39;ve had issues where it doesn&#39;t (16:24 - 16:30)
allow me to pick up like there&#39;s no time (16:27 - 16:32)
for me to pick up and then that is (16:30 - 16:35)
because my specific location is actually (16:32 - 16:37)
closed that day for some reason so like (16:35 - 16:40)
they&#39;re you know they&#39;ll have like a I (16:37 - 16:41)
don&#39;t know employee I&#39;m going to go and (16:40 - 16:42)
just give them a benefit of the doubt (16:41 - 16:44)
that it&#39;s like an Employee Appreciation (16:42 - 16:46)
Day for my location and they won&#39;t be (16:44 - 16:48)
open like on like a Tuesday and then (16:46 - 16:50)
there&#39;ll be no pickup time so I can&#39;t (16:48 - 16:52)
check out or anything because this (16:50 - 16:54)
location is just not open that day if I (16:52 - 16:57)
switch locations I can now check out and (16:54 - 16:59)
like pick a time and stuff so is it (16:57 - 17:01)
possible that your Taco Bell closed down (16:59 - 17:04)
and you don&#39;t know about it no because I (17:01 - 17:07)
then drove there and placed the order (17:04 - 17:09)
manually like (17:07 - 17:12)
a which which involves human interaction (17:09 - 17:13)
I don&#39;t want to do that yeah I just want (17:12 - 17:16)
to say like mobile order for Steve and (17:13 - 17:18)
the like second window please uh no I (17:16 - 17:21)
have two Taco Bells that are 24 hours in (17:18 - 17:22)

reviews across the 400 most used mobile (19:35 - 19:39)
apps in the Google Play Store and (19:38 - 19:43)
identified how often the words bug issue (19:39 - 19:47)

number of reviews mentioning bugs per a (19:49 - 19:53)
thousand (19:52 - 19:57)
reviews okay so they they it was (19:53 - 19:59)
specifically the Google Play Store yes (19:57 - 20:02)
yep because for one for Pokemon I&#39;m not (19:59 - 20:04)
defending Niantic here because we all (20:02 - 20:07)
know that their game is buggy uh but I (20:04 - 20:10)
will say that there&#39;s like with Google (20:07 - 20:12)
from what I&#39;ve heard because I don&#39;t (20:10 - 20:14)
obviously don&#39;t use uh Google phone but (20:12 - 20:17)
um or an Android phone sorry uh there&#39;s (20:14 - 20:20)
like two different stores you can (20:17 - 20:21)
download Pokemon go from and like (20:20 - 20:23)
there&#39;s like a I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a (20:21 - 20:24)
Samsung store or something and then (20:23 - 20:27)
there&#39;s the Google Play Store and I have (20:24 - 20:28)
heard that they like there&#39;s different (20:27 - 20:29)
bugginess (20:28 - 20:32)
between the two different apps um (20:29 - 20:33)
specifically with like the go snapshot (20:32 - 20:36)
update stuff there was like bugginess if (20:33 - 20:38)
you downloaded the app from like the (20:36 - 20:39)
Google Play Store but then there wasn&#39;t (20:38 - 20:41)
the same bugging as if you downloaded it (20:39 - 20:44)
from another like legal store that you (20:41 - 20:46)
can download it from but there was (20:44 - 20:48)
different I download my games from the (20:46 - 20:50)
illegal stores well I&#39;m just I&#39;m trying (20:48 - 20:51)
to say it&#39;s not like someone sideloaded (20:50 - 20:53)
it from some like alt store or anything (20:51 - 20:54)
like that sure (20:53 - 20:58)
sure anyways it&#39;s I don&#39;t again I&#39;m not (20:54 - 21:00)
defending ni because we all know how (20:58 - 21:04)
buggy their game is but but also People (21:00 - 21:06)
review things when they have things to (21:04 - 21:09)
complain about a lot of the time true (21:06 - 21:11)
when it comes to apps so I feel like in (21:09 - 21:13)
part of this the apps that are at the (21:11 - 21:16)
top of these lists are just big (21:13 - 21:18)
apps with a lot of players solitire (21:16 - 21:21)
might be a very popular app for all you (21:18 - 21:24)
know hey I don&#39;t see what&#39;s that game (21:21 - 21:28)
called uh the the the with the c cand I (21:24 - 21:30)
don&#39;t see Candy Crush on here and Candy (21:28 - 21:33)
Crush is is very popular where&#39;s (21:30 - 21:35)
Monopoly go in this situation is it up (21:33 - 21:36)
oh my gosh I saw somebody playing (21:35 - 21:38)
Monopoly go when I was at the dealership (21:36 - 21:40)
getting an oil change she wasn&#39;t even (21:38 - 21:41)
looking at the screen she was just (21:40 - 21:44)
holding down the Go Button which like (21:41 - 21:46)
makes you like go around the (21:44 - 21:48)
board I mean okay not that different (21:46 - 21:52)
from raing in Pokemon it&#39;s true it&#39;s (21:48 - 21:54)
true I&#39;m never looking at the screen (21:52 - 21:57)
when I&#39;m rating (21:54 - 21:57)
um yeah I I&#39;m (22:02 - 22:07)
like not surprised that Pokemon go would (22:07 - 22:12)
be up there because it is incredibly (22:10 - 22:13)
popular (22:12 - 22:17)
MH um but it&#39;s incredibly (22:13 - 22:20)
buggy so checks (22:17 - 22:24)
out I think it&#39;s an interesting way to (22:20 - 22:27)
track that like looking at keywords in (22:24 - 22:31)
reviews mhm um because there is really (22:27 - 22:35)
no way to actually rank how buggy one (22:31 - 22:37)
app is compared to another so I do think (22:35 - 22:42)
this is like a clever way to to do that (22:37 - 22:44)
um I&#39;m trying to think of like what (22:42 - 22:46)
other po like the one that came to mind (22:44 - 22:47)
was Candy Crush but I can&#39;t think of any (22:46 - 22:50)
like Simpsons tapped out I know is still (22:47 - 22:52)
pretty popular it&#39;s not up (22:50 - 22:56)
here um I don&#39;t like play a lot of games (22:52 - 23:00)
on my phone it&#39;s also is an right yeah (22:56 - 23:02)
fortnite no fortnite got pulled oh right (23:00 - 23:05)
it&#39;s not yeah of course (23:02 - 23:09)
yeah they that that argument with apple (23:05 - 23:11)
argument yeah that&#39;s a way to put it but (23:09 - 23:13)
this was the Google Play Store are they (23:11 - 23:15)
still on the Google Play Store very (23:13 - 23:19)
expensive argument yeah they had uh uh (23:15 - 23:21)
is fortnite still on Google Play I think (23:19 - 23:23)
so they pulled it as well but I don&#39;t I (23:21 - 23:25)
don&#39;t remember if they they put it back (23:23 - 23:28)
on there we can just check it&#39;s not on (23:25 - 23:30)
the App Store any more that&#39;s for sure (23:28 - 23:33)
but it&#39;s not on the Google Play store (23:30 - 23:34)
okay cuz I know yeah they had the (23:33 - 23:36)
lawsuit with apple then they had the (23:34 - 23:38)
lawsuit with Google like right after (23:36 - 23:41)
Apple&#39;s lawsuit wait maybe it (23:38 - 23:44)
is no that looks like a knockoff all (23:41 - 23:46)
right is it fortnite but spelled like (23:44 - 23:47)
the like the correct (23:46 - 23:51)
way no it&#39;s just by a different company (23:47 - 23:53)
oh okay you know what I just realized (23:51 - 23:58)
that all apps on iOS has their own (23:53 - 24:01)
section but games has their own section (23:58 - 24:03)
like I went under all apps to like then (24:01 - 24:05)
sort byy games and it didn&#39;t show up I (24:03 - 24:09)
was like mhm yeah that&#39;s newer not (24:05 - 24:12)
totally new but yeah but yeah games and (24:09 - 24:16)
apps are considered different in (24:12 - 24:19)
separate but games are so (24:16 - 24:23)
big that it just it&#39;s it here&#39;s your oh (24:19 - 24:25)
okay we top top charts okay so these are (24:23 - 24:27)
the top paid games that I&#39;m looking at (24:25 - 24:29)
right now Minecraft (24:27 - 24:34)
heads up Papa Frieza to go I don&#39;t know (24:29 - 24:38)
what that is balloons Geometry Dash (24:34 - 24:41)
plague stardo Valley Monopoly the board (24:38 - 24:46)
game Papa pteras to go and then Red&#39;s (24:41 - 24:47)
First Flight which I just think is an (24:46 - 24:51)
Angry Bird&#39;s um sequel or something yeah (24:47 - 24:53)
what it&#39;s the the icon is Angry Bird (24:51 - 24:55)
yeah and then then top top games number (24:53 - 24:58)
one is brawl stars for top free games (24:55 - 25:00)
which was is number six on the most (24:58 - 25:05)
buggy block blast Monopoly go roblocks (25:00 - 25:07)
which is number four and also number (25:05 - 25:09)
four most buggy no number five most (25:07 - 25:12)
buggy last war Survivor which I get Tic (25:09 - 25:15)
Tac tiktock ads for the all time wood (25:12 - 25:18)
nuts and bolt puzzle Subway (25:15 - 25:21)
Surfers which is not on the most buggy (25:18 - 25:22)
list (25:21 - 25:25)
Township uh the New York Times words and (25:22 - 25:28)
games and sidoku and then Call of Duty (25:25 - 25:31)
war zone mobile which is not the same as (25:28 - 25:33)
Call of Duty mobile season (25:31 - 25:36)
2 well hold on you said block blast (25:33 - 25:38)
right and block blast was one of the (25:36 - 25:41)
least buggy games on that list I think (25:38 - 25:46)
no yes all right yes yes yes was number (25:41 - 25:49)
two top game and it&#39;s one of the least (25:46 - 25:51)
buggy I think one thing you have to (25:49 - 25:54)
consider as well is take a game like (25:51 - 25:56)
probably block blast although I&#39;m not (25:54 - 25:57)
going to take that game cuz I&#39;ve never (25:56 - 25:58)
played it I&#39;ll take a game like soliter (25:57 - 26:01)
I played a version two in theore Bobby (25:58 - 26:01)
get to (26:01 - 26:05)
it I&#39;ve played a version of of solitire (26:01 - 26:08)
um and then I played Pokemon go and (26:05 - 26:11)
there&#39;s a vast difference in how those (26:08 - 26:13)
games intera how you interact with those (26:11 - 26:18)
games so there is way more chance and (26:13 - 26:20)
the developer friends here can chime in (26:18 - 26:23)
and comment if they want but I imagine (26:20 - 26:26)
there&#39;s a big difference in developing (26:23 - 26:29)
solitire and developing Pokémon go and (26:26 - 26:32)
you&#39;re going to you know chance at more (26:29 - 26:34)
issues maybe when you have a game where (26:32 - 26:36)
it&#39;s a real world and you&#39;re like it (26:34 - 26:39)
there&#39;s a lot more to it than solitire (26:36 - 26:41)
again I&#39;m not defending Niantic the game (26:39 - 26:43)
is buggy however so what you&#39;re saying (26:41 - 26:46)
is there&#39;s more to it you are you are (26:43 - 26:49)
appalled that Words With Friends a just (26:46 - 26:51)
a (26:49 - 26:51)
scr that is that is the number three (26:52 - 26:58)
most buggy game yeah just a board game (26:55 - 27:01)
yeah it&#39;s a little bit more even that it (26:58 - 27:02)
has the social aspect where you&#39;re (27:01 - 27:03)
playing with like Solitaire you&#39;re not (27:02 - 27:05)
playing with other people I would (27:03 - 27:06)
imagine because Sol you know if that (27:05 - 27:08)
version of Solitaire has like a (27:06 - 27:09)
leaderboard or something but it&#39;s not (27:08 - 27:11)
Solitaire anymore oh a leaderboard okay (27:09 - 27:12)
yeah maybe yeah there could be (27:11 - 27:14)
leaderboards there could be ads there (27:12 - 27:17)
could be location based ads making all (27:14 - 27:20)
of this more complicated true there (27:17 - 27:22)
could be ar mode where you can play (27:20 - 27:25)
soliter in your Park but I I think it&#39;s (27:22 - 27:29)
just there is more chance at more types (27:25 - 27:32)
more stuff with a game like Pokemon go (27:29 - 27:33)
especially with the way that they&#39;re (27:32 - 27:36)
like basing this on so even if you take (27:33 - 27:39)
away the fact that uh the games are that (27:36 - 27:41)
different the way they&#39;re basing this is (27:39 - 27:43)
like just reviews and keywords from (27:41 - 27:45)
reviews I just feel like there is more (27:43 - 27:47)
to complain about with a game that&#39;s a (27:45 - 27:50)
little bit more complex than solitire (27:47 - 27:52)
and if you work on a solitire game I&#39;m (27:50 - 27:54)
sorry and if you if it maybe it is super (27:52 - 27:55)
complex and I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m (27:54 - 27:59)
talking about but I feel like Pokemon go (27:55 - 28:01)
might be a little bit more complex of an (27:59 - 28:03)
app to develop than solitire that&#39;s just (28:01 - 28:06)
my opinion yes you don&#39;t know how (28:03 - 28:08)
complicated Community Day is in solitire (28:06 - 28:11)
Bobby (28:08 - 28:11)
okay you only got three hours to do (28:11 - 28:19)
[Laughter] (28:14 - 28:21)
it (28:19 - 28:24)
um yeah I mean like there&#39;s like a lot (28:21 - 28:27)
of like big big like if you go to like (28:24 - 28:30)
product productivity apps uh like the (28:27 - 28:33)
top most buggies is GTL notion Google (28:30 - 28:36)
Docs like you have what one of the (28:33 - 28:39)
biggest companies in the world Google (28:36 - 28:41)
and their Google Docs is the third most (28:39 - 28:43)
buggiest in (28:41 - 28:47)
productivity um Evernote one password (28:43 - 28:50)
I&#39;m why am I paying $60 a year for one (28:47 - 28:51)
password it&#39;s on this list it&#39;s to be (28:50 - 28:54)
fair though I agree one password always (28:51 - 28:56)
has something going on like it&#39;s (28:54 - 28:59)
blocking my my contact Fe it&#39;s not (28:56 - 29:00)

pretty much sold out within like 2 (33:16 - 33:21)
minutes oh wow (33:18 - 33:23)
I I know there&#39;s I feel like there&#39;s an (33:21 - 33:25)
Ulta store like everywhere I feel like (33:23 - 33:30)
every mall still has Ulta (33:25 - 33:30)
maybe it looks like online not (33:30 - 33:33)
everything is sold (33:32 - 33:36)
out oh I I bet they res I would assume (33:33 - 33:38)
they probably restocked right yeah at (33:36 - 33:40)
the time of recording it looks like only (33:38 - 33:44)
the quote unquote pH lip balms are sold (33:40 - 33:46)
out and the lip mask that comes in the (33:44 - 33:48)
cute little (33:46 - 33:50)
Pokeball but everything else seems to be (33:48 - 33:52)
in (33:50 - 33:52)
stock it&#39;s good I I I don&#39;t know is is (33:53 - 33:59)
this I have no clue about makeup is this (33:57 - 34:04)
expensive $30 for the it&#39;s not the it&#39;s (33:59 - 34:07)
not that expensive I think I&#39;m also the (34:04 - 34:11)
wrong person to really ask but it&#39;s not (34:07 - 34:13)
that expensive the single eyeshadows are (34:11 - 34:17)
$9 which is kind of expensive (34:13 - 34:21)
but I Pokemon tax yeah I was say Pokemon (34:17 - 34:25)
tax can&#39;t imagine it&#39;s cheaper than it (34:21 - 34:27)
would be if there weren&#39;t Pokemon if it (34:25 - 34:30)
wasn&#39;t Pokemon themed but it&#39;s also not (34:27 - 34:31)
high (34:30 - 34:36)
quality okay um this isn&#39;t yeah and it&#39;s (34:31 - 34:41)
just gen one Pokemon slapped onto (34:36 - 34:41)
packaging mentioned in our slack they (34:41 - 34:47)
look like Party City (34:44 - 34:50)
decorations um oh No Just when when you (34:47 - 34:52)
take the standard Pokemon decorations (34:50 - 34:53)
that you can find at Party City or (34:52 - 34:56)
Target this looks like that it&#39;s just (34:53 - 34:58)
makeup (34:56 - 35:00)
geez well goodbye to our party city (34:58 - 35:02)
sponsorship thanks (35:00 - 35:04)
[Laughter] (35:02 - 35:06)
Hannah I&#39;m not saying I don&#39;t like (35:04 - 35:08)
having Pokemon all over the place I&#39;m (35:06 - 35:12)
just saying this is what you should (35:08 - 35:16)
expect so um okay I yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s not (35:12 - 35:18)
like like buying a Pokemon hoodie or (35:16 - 35:21)
something that you&#39;re wearing it&#39;s like (35:18 - 35:23)
I can&#39;t believe you didn&#39;t notice my (35:21 - 35:26)
Jigglypuff eyeliner it&#39;s nice to have (35:23 - 35:28)
pretty little things I don&#39;t know (35:26 - 35:30)
if you know Kiki&#39;s Delivery Service I (35:28 - 35:34)
have a very small nail clipper with Gigi (35:30 - 35:36)
the cat from Kiki&#39;s Delivery Service (35:34 - 35:38)
that I carry in my bag every day and (35:36 - 35:40)
that makes me happy and I feel like I&#39;m (35:38 - 35:42)
not really a makeup person but I feel (35:40 - 35:43)
like these kind of things do that for (35:42 - 35:47)
people too so I kind of wish they were (35:43 - 35:49)
prettier yeah yeah but your your nail (35:47 - 35:53)
file is not like 10 time (35:49 - 35:56)
[Laughter] (35:53 - 35:59)
use I think you can get get more than I (35:56 - 36:01)
I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t use makeup enough I (35:59 - 36:03)
think you can get more than 10 uses out (36:01 - 36:05)
of all of these (36:03 - 36:08)
things I do (36:05 - 36:11)
mask I do know in Japan they have a lot (36:08 - 36:14)
of it&#39;s not makeup it&#39;s more like um (36:11 - 36:17)
just like I don&#39;t consider a face mask (36:14 - 36:19)
makeup I just consider that like putting (36:17 - 36:23)
a face mask costic yeah cosmetic they (36:19 - 36:25)
have those in like Pokemon centers um (36:23 - 36:27)
and you can actually find them at like (36:25 - 36:28)
Family Mart and stuff and they&#39;re (36:27 - 36:30)
they&#39;re relatively inexpensive they&#39;re (36:28 - 36:35)
like 180 Yen or something which in gosh (36:30 - 36:37)
that&#39;s like that&#39;s like just a dollar in (36:35 - 36:39)
the in in USD because of how strong the (36:37 - 36:43)
dollar is but (36:39 - 36:45)
uh I don&#39;t think they&#39;re any different (36:43 - 36:47)
than like a (36:45 - 36:50)
a a normal face mask it&#39;s just this one (36:47 - 36:52)
has a Jigglypuff on it or this one has a (36:50 - 36:54)
Pikachu on it (36:52 - 36:56)
yeah sometimes they&#39;re fun and the face (36:54 - 36:59)
mask makes you look like the Pokemon but (36:56 - 37:01)
really weird and sometimes they&#39;re (36:59 - 37:03)
boring and it&#39;s just a pattern repeating (37:01 - 37:05)
all over the place (37:03 - 37:08)
mhm but so this isn&#39;t the first time (37:05 - 37:10)
Pokemon has done makeup they do (37:08 - 37:13)
sometimes stock it in Pokemon centers in (37:10 - 37:16)
Japan this is maybe the first time (37:13 - 37:19)
they&#39;ve made it available to us (37:16 - 37:21)
customers just any sort of Pokemon (37:19 - 37:24)
makeup I don&#39;t (37:21 - 37:24)
know it&#39;s like like Hannah said it&#39;s (37:24 - 37:31)
mostly in stock on colourpop color with (37:28 - 37:32)
a (37:31 - 37:34)
u colourpop.com (37:32 - 37:35)
[Music] (37:34 - 37:38)
um I will say I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m (37:35 - 37:40)
looking at here but it&#39;s the product (37:38 - 37:42)
that it has Bulbasaur Charmander and (37:40 - 37:45)
Squirtle are like on the boxes yeah (37:42 - 37:48)
those are single eyeshadows those single (37:45 - 37:51)
eyeshadows probably have like the best (37:48 - 37:53)
in my opinion the best like look for the (37:51 - 37:55)
casing like if you want like you know (37:53 - 37:58)
cuz your your point is it&#39;s it&#39;s not (37:55 - 38:02)
like the actual product itself tells you (37:58 - 38:03)
that it&#39;s a Pokemon thing but like the (38:02 - 38:04)
but like the case that it&#39;s in or (38:03 - 38:06)
whatever is like what showing it and I (38:04 - 38:08)
feel like that is the best like that (38:06 - 38:09)
doesn&#39;t look like a Party City (38:08 - 38:11)
decoration in my opinion that actually (38:09 - 38:13)
looks like a a nice like it&#39;s got the (38:11 - 38:15)
little water drop for like the Squirtle (38:13 - 38:17)
one and then little for the B little (38:15 - 38:19)
type symbols and like that&#39;s cool the (38:17 - 38:20)
ones that are like just it looks like a (38:19 - 38:22)
sticker of Pikachu&#39;s put on the back of (38:20 - 38:24)
a thing it&#39;s like oh that&#39;s a little bit (38:22 - 38:27)
like cheap looking but some of them some (38:24 - 38:29)
of it looks pretty cool (38:27 - 38:29)
so I don&#39;t have much else than that on (38:30 - 38:34)
this but some of it looks nice some of (38:32 - 38:37)
it looks a little like yeah sorry Party (38:34 - 38:40)
City but yeah (38:37 - 38:42)
yeah uh well speaking of merchandise uh (38:40 - 38:45)
the Pokemon Center online store is going (38:42 - 38:48)
to come to Australia and New Zealand (38:45 - 38:51)
with a soft launch so (38:48 - 38:53)
yeah (38:51 - 38:57)
exciting that&#39;s very yeah it&#39;s a really (38:53 - 39:00)
good thing making it easier for PO for (38:57 - 39:01)
people to get Pokemon stuff when they (39:00 - 39:03)
want (39:01 - 39:07)
to uh Australia (39:03 - 39:09)
still I still don&#39;t think they ever got (39:07 - 39:11)
Zer Ora (39:09 - 39:13)
properly I think there was like a lot of (39:11 - 39:16)
distributions that like never really (39:13 - 39:17)
came to (39:16 - 39:20)
Australia um I mean there&#39;s a lot of (39:17 - 39:21)
countries that don&#39;t get the Pokemon (39:20 - 39:24)
treatment sure at all so this this is (39:21 - 39:27)
very exciting that Australia New Zealand (39:24 - 39:30)
are getting who knows how big that is (39:27 - 39:32)
like technically the Canadian Pokemon (39:30 - 39:34)
Center does not have everything the (39:32 - 39:38)
American Pokemon Center has um and (39:34 - 39:40)
Europe also just doesn&#39;t have a Pokemon (39:38 - 39:42)

bundles uh yeah this seems like a big (44:31 - 44:37)
set any surprises here Bobby um I mean (44:34 - 44:39)
it&#39;s not a dragon set this is the like (44:37 - 44:41)
special set people thought would be a (44:39 - 44:44)
dragon set in a coming out in August uh (44:41 - 44:47)
so it is a special set though but there (44:44 - 44:49)
is a dragon set coming out in Japan (44:47 - 44:52)
right oh is there maybe but that they (44:49 - 44:53)
thought that this was going to be that (44:52 - 44:55)
set in English was going to be a dragon (44:53 - 44:58)
set okay and uh this is but it is a (44:55 - 45:00)
special set so no booster boxes no just (44:58 - 45:03)
individual sleeved boosters for this if (45:00 - 45:05)
you want packs you&#39;re going to be buying (45:03 - 45:08)
a collection box of sorts or like one of (45:05 - 45:10)
those booster bundles with like six (45:08 - 45:14)
packs um but yeah I mean they do the new (45:10 - 45:16)
uh the illustration rare collection is (45:14 - 45:19)
new so oh that is new yeah the new so (45:16 - 45:21)
that&#39;s it&#39;s a Greninja a king Gambit one (45:19 - 45:24)
and then a kingra one they will come (45:21 - 45:26)
with the like that that promo that you (45:24 - 45:28)
were talking about this the illustration (45:26 - 45:32)
rare promo in that box so um they have (45:28 - 45:35)
revealed the Greninja one which is a lot (45:32 - 45:37)
of people are really loving um but (45:35 - 45:40)
that&#39;s a it&#39;s a promo which is some (45:37 - 45:42)
people like that some people don&#39;t some (45:40 - 45:43)
people wish you know oh why can&#39;t we (45:42 - 45:45)
just have to pull everything so it makes (45:43 - 45:47)
it more rare uh some people appreciate (45:45 - 45:49)
it that it it&#39;s a promo so you can just (45:47 - 45:51)
get it in a box um but nothing else (45:49 - 45:53)
really surprising about this uh because (45:51 - 45:56)
it&#39;s a special set it is smaller I say (45:53 - 45:58)
smaller it&#39;s like still like hundred and (45:56 - 46:01)
some OD cards but um smaller than most (45:58 - 46:02)
of the the (46:01 - 46:05)
sets other than that I think it&#39;s the (46:02 - 46:08)
last of the teal mask sets so I think (46:05 - 46:11)
following this we&#39;ll start getting sets (46:08 - 46:15)
that are uh more related to the second (46:11 - 46:19)
part of the DLC for scarlet Violet so (46:15 - 46:21)
this just kind of finishes off the teal (46:19 - 46:25)
mask stuff which is why um the loyal 3 (46:21 - 46:27)
are are featured so prominently I think (46:25 - 46:30)
ogre Pon got her set in the in the last (46:27 - 46:34)
one 15 ogre Pon cards in that set and (46:30 - 46:36)
then uh well that La when I say last set (46:34 - 46:39)
hasn&#39;t even come out yet it comes out as (46:36 - 46:41)
we record this it comes out NE this (46:39 - 46:44)
Friday so they&#39;re giving us these new (46:41 - 46:47)
announcements and everything before the (46:44 - 46:51)
the current set even releases but yeah (46:47 - 46:53)
seems like a good set see seems like (46:51 - 46:55)
it&#39;ll be cool um I I&#39;m not sure on like (46:53 - 46:57)
the playability of the cards at this (46:55 - 46:58)
point there hasn&#39;t been a whole lot (46:57 - 47:01)
revealed um I think just a couple of (46:58 - 47:03)
like the a speec cards and stuff have (47:01 - 47:07)
been revealed um but should be (47:03 - 47:08)
interesting to see like you said it&#39;s (47:07 - 47:10)
going to be based off of night Wanderer (47:08 - 47:13)
and that comes out fairly soon I think (47:10 - 47:15)
you said in sometime in (47:13 - 47:19)
June uh yes we&#39;ll get an idea at that (47:15 - 47:21)
point on really what&#39;s playable and (47:19 - 47:23)
whether it&#39;s more of a collector&#39;s set (47:21 - 47:27)
or more of a a playable set (47:23 - 47:29)
um I didn&#39;t put this in the show notes (47:27 - 47:31)
but uh we can run through this real (47:29 - 47:36)
quick uh the I am leaving for Japan (47:31 - 47:39)
because of Pokemon go Fest in Sendai uh (47:36 - 47:42)
Sendai is like two hours north of Tokyo (47:39 - 47:45)
via the the the bullet train um Sendai (47:42 - 47:48)
is apparent this this is their own this (47:45 - 47:50)
their words not mine they&#39;re the they (47:48 - 47:52)
say they&#39;re the greenest city in the (47:50 - 47:55)
world um so we&#39;ll we&#39;ll see if that&#39;s (47:52 - 47:58)
true but Niantic did release additional (47:55 - 48:00)
information for Sendai there&#39;s going to (47:58 - 48:03)
be a shopping campaign in the streets of (48:00 - 48:05)
Sendai what that means is you can get (48:03 - 48:08)
limited edition Pokemon go Sendai (48:05 - 48:11)
stickers by showing the Go game screen (48:08 - 48:15)
Ty participating Stores um select stores (48:11 - 48:18)
will have a poster in their window and (48:15 - 48:20)
then you&#39;ll be able to show your Pokemon (48:18 - 48:23)
game screen to the staff member and then (48:20 - 48:25)
they will give you a sticker we don&#39;t (48:23 - 48:27)
know what the sticker looks like or if (48:25 - 48:33)
they&#39;re different or what that means at (48:27 - 48:36)
all there will also be yeah yeah there (48:33 - 48:38)
will also be a Pikachu sun visor (48:36 - 48:40)
distribution they do this at every (48:38 - 48:42)
in-person event they&#39;re just saying that (48:40 - 48:44)
they will be on these two specific (48:42 - 48:48)
streets in suai from 10: to 5: every day (48:44 - 48:50)
for those that don&#39;t know the suai go (48:48 - 48:52)
Fest is four days long the Madrid and (48:50 - 48:54)
the New York one are only three days (48:52 - 48:57)
long um there is an official route in (48:54 - 49:00)
Sendai and also the reason I&#39;m saying (48:57 - 49:01)
this (49:00 - 49:03)
is this is probably not happening for (49:01 - 49:06)
New York but maybe I don&#39;t know if the (49:03 - 49:08)
New York go fest last year had an (49:06 - 49:12)
official route I don&#39;t think they did uh (49:08 - 49:15)
otherwise we would have heard about it (49:12 - 49:16)
um but they there will be an official (49:15 - 49:18)
route it says with cooperation of the (49:16 - 49:21)
city of Sendai uh the official route is (49:18 - 49:23)
now launched the official route will (49:21 - 49:25)
offer you a variety of routes to take (49:23 - 49:27)
within Sendai the greenest city where (49:25 - 49:29)
where nature and City are in harmony you (49:27 - 49:31)
can discover Foods shopping historial (49:29 - 49:33)
historical sites and other fascinating (49:31 - 49:37)
sites of Sendai City the official route (49:33 - 49:40)
is a route selected by local government (49:37 - 49:43)
across Japan that recommends places to (49:40 - 49:45)
play Pokemon (49:43 - 49:46)
go (49:45 - 49:50)
um so that&#39;s cool that&#39;s cool that&#39;s (49:46 - 49:53)
kind of part of what routes should be (49:50 - 49:56)
not all of it I think that citizen (49:53 - 49:59)
player input is important too but having (49:56 - 50:02)
routes that are this highly recommended (49:59 - 50:05)
based on important parts of a city are I (50:02 - 50:07)
think part of the part of what they (50:05 - 50:10)
wanted that future to be yeah you don&#39;t (50:07 - 50:12)
you know the the route from the front of (50:10 - 50:14)
your hotel to the convention (50:12 - 50:18)
center is is optimal and convenient for (50:14 - 50:21)
grinding rewards but probably not the (50:18 - 50:26)
core concept Niantic one (50:21 - 50:26)
uh there will be Flags appearing in (50:28 - 50:33)
Sendai uh decorated by limited edition (50:30 - 50:36)
Pokemon go Sendai Flags also some areas (50:33 - 50:38)
will be overlapped with official Roots (50:36 - 50:40)
please enjoy the same both at the same (50:38 - 50:42)
time um there will also be a (50:40 - 50:45)
collaboration with the loop loople (50:42 - 50:51)
Sendai and Subway the lole is um it&#39;s (50:45 - 50:52)
like a trolley car that&#39;s what they&#39;re (50:51 - 50:55)
calling that&#39;s that&#39;s what it is in the (50:52 - 50:58)
picture uh it will be decorated it&#39;s oh (50:55 - 50:59)
they they&#39;re calling it a bus it it (50:58 - 51:03)
looks like like a San Francisco trolley (50:59 - 51:05)
car (51:03 - 51:08)
um so they will have the bus they will (51:05 - 51:10)
have the they will have a one-day pass (51:08 - 51:12)
for the bus or the Subway and then they (51:10 - 51:16)
will have um 24-hour and 36-h hour (51:12 - 51:20)
passes for What&#39;s called the Sendai Mass (51:16 - 51:23)
which is just two it&#39;s the to line and (51:20 - 51:27)
the Nam Nuku line (51:23 - 51:28)
and those will go on S they&#39;re not on (51:27 - 51:30)
sale yet they will go on sale on May (51:28 - 51:33)
21st and you can start using those (51:30 - 51:35)
tickets on May (51:33 - 51:37)
30th I don&#39;t even know if that&#39;s worth (51:35 - 51:40)
trying to get because they will probably (51:37 - 51:42)
be sold out instantly I would also (51:40 - 51:44)
assume like if you&#39;re like me and you&#39;re (51:42 - 51:46)
traveling there you probably can&#39;t buy (51:44 - 51:48)
that stuff online I&#39;m assuming you&#39;re (51:46 - 51:50)
going to have to probably buy that in (51:48 - 51:52)
person at one of (51:50 - 51:55)
their like a 7-Eleven or or something (51:52 - 51:57)
that&#39;s usually how tickets for those (51:55 - 52:00)
things work um and then finally there (51:57 - 52:03)
will be a uh Lapras (52:00 - 52:05)
Cafe uh which doesn&#39;t have a lot of (52:03 - 52:09)
details Lapras is the mascot of Sendai (52:05 - 52:11)
um there are some areas of Japan that (52:09 - 52:12)
have (52:11 - 52:15)
mascots uh like fukushima&#39;s mascot is (52:12 - 52:20)
chansy Sendai is Lapras Hokkaido is (52:15 - 52:23)
alolan Vulpix Tokyo doesn&#39;t have a (52:20 - 52:24)
mascot for the record because they don&#39;t (52:23 - 52:27)
want you they want you to leave Tokyo (52:24 - 52:29)
right isn&#39;t one of them is sandrew a (52:27 - 52:31)
mascot for something or do they do the (52:29 - 52:36)
sandrew sandrew is Geodude is um aswat (52:31 - 52:40)
is the mascot of May I think which (52:36 - 52:44)
is two hours East of (52:40 - 52:47)
Osaka or maybe Kyoto one of those well (52:44 - 52:51)
they&#39;re pretty close together (52:47 - 52:54)
um yeah there&#39;s a whole page dedicated (52:51 - 52:57)
to their mascots MH right (52:54 - 53:00)
um they&#39;re saying the Sendai Reich or uh (52:57 - 53:04)
the Sendai Visitor Center will host (53:00 - 53:09)
the Lapras event but also the cafe is I (53:04 - 53:12)
don&#39;t think I think the cafe is a pop-up (53:09 - 53:14)
Cafe I don&#39;t think the cafe is just (53:12 - 53:16)
always there right there&#39;s not usually a (53:14 - 53:21)
Lapras Cafe yeah but (53:16 - 53:21)
again I I think a lot of these are going (53:22 - 53:27)
to be incredibly hard to get into or to (53:24 - 53:29)
participate in (53:27 - 53:33)
because Pokemon is very very popular in (53:29 - 53:36)
Japan maybe maybe there&#39;s a chance for (53:33 - 53:37)
like the (53:36 - 53:39)
cafe on like the (53:37 - 53:42)
Thursday because people still have work (53:39 - 53:44)
or people aren&#39;t planning to come until (53:42 - 53:47)
Friday Saturday maybe if it&#39;s a pop-up (53:44 - 53:50)
Cafe though yeah maybe not the website (53:47 - 53:53)
for the cafe doesn&#39;t even (53:50 - 53:53)
load we&#39;re off to a great start here (53:54 - 53:58)
um yeah you know honestly I I (54:00 - 54:09)
hope that New York has more to do is (54:04 - 54:11)
bigger um is more exciting since they&#39;re (54:09 - 54:14)
doing it again in New York (54:11 - 54:17)
but Japan does get very special (54:14 - 54:19)
treatment when it comes to these things (54:17 - 54:22)
yeah it really does New York was still (54:19 - 54:26)
fun though just still a good experience (54:22 - 54:30)
even if it doesn&#39;t have a pop-up (54:26 - 54:30)
cafe or decorated subway (54:31 - 54:38)
cars all around the city with Pokemon on (54:35 - 54:41)
them yeah I don&#39;t know if New York does (54:38 - 54:43)
decorate their subway cars at all I (54:41 - 54:44)
would assume if there was like a big (54:43 - 54:47)
movie promotion there might (54:44 - 54:50)
be I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen a (54:47 - 54:53)
decorated Subway the buses have ads for (54:50 - 54:55)
sure but yeah yeah right well I mean (54:53 - 54:59)
that&#39;s all it is a giant (54:55 - 54:59)
ad uh let&#39;s end with some scarlet and (54:59 - 55:04)
violet news there&#39;s just a bunch of (55:02 - 55:08)
distributions that have happened or are (55:04 - 55:11)
happening um so right now until June (55:08 - 55:13)
30th you have plenty of time Bobby to (55:11 - 55:15)
redeem this you probably won&#39;t redeem it (55:13 - 55:19)
until June 29th I&#39;m sure uh is the (55:15 - 55:21)
Gyarados used by the Singaporean (55:19 - 55:25)
Champion is Distributing um so that code (55:21 - 55:28)
is on I I&#39;ve posted on Twitter Instagram (55:25 - 55:30)
it&#39;s in slack it&#39;s in Discord it&#39;s very (55:28 - 55:32)
easy to find these codes but there is a (55:30 - 55:37)
competitive Gyarados that you can get um (55:32 - 55:39)
this Gyarados is not like a two-day (55:37 - 55:42)
thing because uh the Asian championships (55:39 - 55:44)
is like several countries so they&#39;re (55:42 - 55:46)
keeping this Gyarados active throughout (55:44 - 55:49)
that entire (55:46 - 55:51)
Championship uh (55:49 - 55:55)
tour bracket length League however you (55:51 - 55:58)
call it so that&#39;s why it&#39;s not a two-day (55:55 - 56:00)
thing there is a Talon (55:58 - 56:04)
flame that is not available (56:00 - 56:07)
yet um and the reason I say that is (56:04 - 56:09)
because that Talon flame will will only (56:07 - 56:12)
be like a two to three day limited code (56:09 - 56:16)
um that should appear around June 1st (56:12 - 56:18)
June 2nd depending on what time zone (56:16 - 56:22)
you&#39;re in and that Talon flame was from (56:18 - 56:23)
the (56:22 - 56:25)
2023 Japan (56:23 - 56:27)
championships um so these Pokémon for (56:25 - 56:29)
those that don&#39;t know when it&#39;s a (56:27 - 56:33)
champion Pokemon it is 100% what they (56:29 - 56:35)
used so it&#39;s their terot type it&#39;s their (56:33 - 56:39)
held item it&#39;s their EES their ivys even (56:35 - 56:42)
down to the nature so like if this (56:39 - 56:46)
Talent if this Talon flame was sassy but (56:42 - 56:49)
they changed it to adamant with a mint (56:46 - 56:51)
you would still get the sassy Talon (56:49 - 56:54)
flame even though that&#39;s not the right (56:51 - 56:56)
nature that was the nature it was caught (56:54 - 56:58)
at they just minted it to match it so (56:56 - 57:00)
that&#39;s why I think there&#39;s like an iron (56:58 - 57:02)
hands where it was like the worst (57:00 - 57:04)
possible nature for iron hands and (57:02 - 57:06)
people are like oh did they mess up and (57:04 - 57:07)
it&#39;s like no they just caught the iron (57:06 - 57:09)
hands at that nature and then they used (57:07 - 57:14)
a mint to get the correct nature so um (57:09 - 57:16)
that Talon flame will be (57:14 - 57:19)
available and then uh dots (57:16 - 57:22)
quackley is now (57:19 - 57:26)
available uh which matches her quaxi in (57:22 - 57:28)
the anime so since she caught it in a (57:26 - 57:30)
Pokeball I guess (57:28 - 57:32)
spoilers it is spoilers those episodes (57:30 - 57:36)
are relatively new um so since she (57:32 - 57:38)
caught it in a Pokeball uh the quackley (57:36 - 57:41)
is in a Pokeball just like um we we (57:38 - 57:43)
already got Freed&#39;s (57:41 - 57:46)
Charizard which was in a Pokeball and (57:43 - 57:48)
then (57:46 - 57:51)
spto Leo&#39;s (57:48 - 57:54)
spti spatio caught the Leo uh which was (57:51 - 57:57)
in a Pokeball (57:54 - 57:59)
uh we have not I did I did find it (57:57 - 58:02)
interesting that they did dot before (57:59 - 58:05)
they did (58:02 - 58:07)
Roy yeah I feel like they may have (58:05 - 58:10)
preferred Leo over Roy and we might not (58:07 - 58:12)
ever get (58:10 - 58:15)
Roy&#39;s maybe what no I think we get Roy (58:12 - 58:17)
there&#39;s no way this feels like it&#39;s it (58:15 - 58:19)
it&#39;s coming out with the second batch of (58:17 - 58:22)
episodes coming out in the (58:19 - 58:26)
US right they did not that this is (58:22 - 58:27)
related to that but they did recently do (58:26 - 58:31)
like a quackley day in Japan as well at (58:27 - 58:33)
the Pokemon centers in Japan where it (58:31 - 58:35)
was all completely quackley themed and (58:33 - 58:37)
like there was all these different (58:35 - 58:40)
quackley like plushies and yeah I know (58:37 - 58:42)
what you&#39;re talking about style of (58:40 - 58:44)
quackley and like the qua with the (58:42 - 58:47)
messed up hair and stuff and I&#39;m not (58:44 - 58:48)
saying any of that&#39;s related to this but (58:47 - 58:49)
I just thought it was I didn&#39;t realize (58:48 - 58:51)
that they did that kind of stuff there I (58:49 - 58:53)
thought that was pretty cool um but I (58:51 - 58:55)
haven&#39;t seen like a f Coco day or like (58:53 - 58:57)
atito day (58:55 - 59:00)
just just (58:57 - 59:00)
quackle (59:00 - 59:04)
um I could see them doing quackle (59:02 - 59:06)
because I do feel like I don&#39;t know how (59:04 - 59:08)
many of the new episodes you&#39;ve seen (59:06 - 59:10)
Hannah I feel like watched all of them (59:08 - 59:13)
on Friday oh okay I&#39;m I have like three (59:10 - 59:16)
more left I feel like the the first (59:13 - 59:20)
handful of episodes are so dot focused (59:16 - 59:23)
MH so like that kind of makes sense (59:20 - 59:25)
lining up dot with like well there was (59:23 - 59:27)
recently a quaxi day now the (59:25 - 59:31)
dot now we we fully have revealed dot in (59:27 - 59:35)
the anime I don&#39;t know maybe Roy will (59:31 - 59:37)
have like a small Arc or his moment so (59:35 - 59:40)
then they can line that up with well (59:37 - 59:42)
also the the the timing right Leo came (59:40 - 59:45)
out with the first batch dot came out (59:42 - 59:47)
with the second so whenever Netflix does (59:45 - 59:50)
the next 12 I would guess that would be (59:47 - 59:53)
Roy&#39;s probably probably yeah and (59:50 - 59:55)
there&#39;ll just be a (59:53 - 59:58)
focus yeah maybe but like when they did (59:55 - 59:59)
the when they did come out like I (59:58 - 60:00)
haven&#39;t seen any of the episodes so this (59:59 - 60:03)
is just going off of um like Pokemon go (60:00 - 60:06)
they had that event when Horizon for (60:03 - 60:09)
Horizons and that event had like when (60:06 - 60:11)
you took a picture it gave you different (60:09 - 60:13)
instead of smeargle for the ghost (60:11 - 60:16)
snapshot photo bomb it was um oh the (60:13 - 60:18)
star pictures from the anime and they (60:16 - 60:21)
didn&#39;t have anything to do with quackley (60:18 - 60:23)
so they only had Leo with spatio and Roy (60:21 - 60:25)
with bu Coco and then Fred with (60:23 - 60:27)
Charizard and a captain Pikachu one but (60:25 - 60:30)
there was no I know I went to (60:27 - 60:32)
that I went to that event in person and (60:30 - 60:34)
there was no quackle (60:32 - 60:37)
bag but like they didn&#39;t have the focus (60:34 - 60:40)
on Dot and quaxa yet right but my point (60:37 - 60:42)
is like Roy and foko like kind of had (60:40 - 60:45)
that moment with Leo and spatio as far (60:42 - 60:51)
as at least Pokemon go is concerned but (60:45 - 60:55)
I minor anime spoilers I was very on (60:51 - 60:59)
board with Roy and Fu Coco&#39;s partnership (60:55 - 61:01)
when they first met and like how Fu KOCO (60:59 - 61:06)
was like nervous to sing around people (61:01 - 61:08)
which is like that should not be any (61:06 - 61:10)
spoiler that FY Coco sings because its (61:08 - 61:13)
final evolution is literally a (61:10 - 61:17)
singer it&#39;s annoying now like the second (61:13 - 61:20)
part of the anime like like anytime play (61:17 - 61:23)
Coco&#39;s like about to battle Roy does (61:20 - 61:27)
this this chant that doesn&#39;t rhyme at (61:23 - 61:31)
all like maybe it Rhymes better in (61:27 - 61:34)
Japanese I&#39;m not sure but like the the (61:31 - 61:38)
English chant doesn&#39;t rhyme at all and (61:34 - 61:42)
it&#39;s infuriating and he does okay like (61:38 - 61:44)
half of it (61:42 - 61:48)
Rhymes there it&#39;s one line what the the (61:44 - 61:52)
the go go f Coco yeah yeah that rhymes (61:48 - 61:54)
but when they&#39;re when he&#39;s battling a (61:52 - 61:57)
specific gym leader he does a longer (61:54 - 61:59)
version of the song okay yeah I think (61:57 - 62:01)
that bucked me a little bit and it (61:59 - 62:05)
didn&#39;t rhyme at all and I was I was no (62:01 - 62:08)
like I think one of the more refreshing (62:05 - 62:10)
things in (62:08 - 62:12)
Horizons (62:10 - 62:15)
was it felt like there (62:12 - 62:18)
wasn&#39;t like I say this all the time it (62:15 - 62:20)
just doesn&#39;t feel like a Scooby-Doo (62:18 - 62:21)
episode or like when you watch a (62:20 - 62:24)
Scooby-Doo episode it&#39;s like it&#39;s (62:21 - 62:27)
self-contained but also we have to like (62:24 - 62:30)
if if it wasn&#39;t for these lousy kids or (62:27 - 62:31)
like (62:30 - 62:33)
Ry like like you have like these sound (62:31 - 62:35)
bites you have to hit right and the old (62:33 - 62:37)
anime was that like you had to hit your (62:35 - 62:39)
woba Fett sound bite you had to hit like (62:37 - 62:41)
we&#39;re blasting off again you had to hit (62:39 - 62:43)
all (62:41 - 62:46)
and up to this point it in Horizons (62:43 - 62:48)
there wasn&#39;t any of that like Leo I (62:46 - 62:51)
don&#39;t think has like a you&#39;re such a kid (62:48 - 62:54)
Ash like she doesn&#39;t (62:51 - 62:56)
have a voice line that you&#39;re like ah (62:54 - 62:58)
classic (62:56 - 63:06)
Leo but but Roy&#39;s F Coco chant is is he (62:58 - 63:08)
doesn&#39;t do it every episode yeah it&#39;s (63:06 - 63:10)
not in every (63:08 - 63:16)
episode it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s fine it&#39;s (63:10 - 63:20)
fun it&#39;s it&#39;s (63:16 - 63:22)
okay I have three more episodes to go (63:20 - 63:24)
and I swear if it&#39;s three more episodes (63:22 - 63:28)
of f Coco chanting (63:24 - 63:28)
I gotta and watch these (63:28 - 63:34)
episodes it&#39;s a good show yeah no it&#39;s (63:31 - 63:38)
it&#39;s uh it&#39;s it&#39;s really it&#39;s really (63:34 - 63:43)
great um so dots quackley and Leo&#39;s (63:38 - 63:45)
spatio are both still (63:43 - 63:48)
available um they both come with the (63:45 - 63:50)
partner ribbon which that ribbon was (63:48 - 63:53)
introduced in (63:50 - 63:57)
the um DLC the DLC I can&#39;t remember (63:53 - 63:59)
Indigo (63:57 - 64:01)
disc these competitive Pokemon also have (63:59 - 64:02)
the partner (64:01 - 64:06)
ribbon so the Talon Flame the Gyarados (64:02 - 64:08)
what was before (64:06 - 64:12)
the Gyarados there was a flutter man oh (64:08 - 64:14)
yeah the flutter man yeah that had the (64:12 - 64:16)
partner ribbon I believe the iron hands (64:14 - 64:17)
has one and then before that they were (64:16 - 64:21)
all just the champion ribbon yes (64:17 - 64:24)
um which is which is kind of unfortunate (64:21 - 64:26)
cuz they did Freeds chariz Ard that was (64:24 - 64:28)
like the (64:26 - 64:31)
first anime thing but because that came (64:28 - 64:35)
out before the Indigo disc freed doesn&#39;t (64:31 - 64:37)
have the partner ribbon on (64:35 - 64:40)
it which is a bit of a bummer (64:37 - 64:42)
sad (64:40 - 64:44)
um and also (64:42 - 64:47)
to the people who literally won (64:44 - 64:49)
tournaments and their Pokemon were (64:47 - 64:52)
distributed before the Indigo disc yeah (64:49 - 64:55)
are all missing the partner ribbon yeah (64:52 - 64:57)
that&#39;s a bummer (64:55 - 64:59)
what what level are the are the champion (64:57 - 65:01)
ones at level 100 then too no they&#39;re (64:59 - 65:05)
all at 50 or at 50 sorry okay (65:01 - 65:05)
yeah um but yeah I would assume we would (65:06 - 65:13)
get Roy&#39;s Foy Coco (65:10 - 65:15)
eventually (65:13 - 65:19)
and um there there was plenty of more (65:15 - 65:21)
Pokemon in the anime they could continue (65:19 - 65:23)
doing if they wanted to if they wanted (65:21 - 65:26)
to I mean they also did the Rev of room (65:23 - 65:28)
to go along with the shorts and the (65:26 - 65:29)
dragapult and they&#39;ve they&#39;ve had a (65:28 - 65:32)
number of Pokemon distributions in (65:29 - 65:35)
scarlet and violet just going on with (65:32 - 65:38)
all sorts of things in the last (65:35 - 65:41)
year yeah and for the the competitive (65:38 - 65:43)
going back to the competitive Pokemon (65:41 - 65:44)
like the Gyarados or the the Talonflame (65:43 - 65:48)
or the iron hands um they would be (65:44 - 65:52)
shiny if the competitor uses a shiny (65:48 - 65:56)
version of that that&#39;s how that works um (65:52 - 65:58)
I would I would say that most people (65:56 - 66:00)
winning a tournament probably has one or (65:58 - 66:04)
two shinies on their team but the but (66:00 - 66:06)
the Gyarados in this instant wasn&#39;t (66:04 - 66:07)
shiny like it could have been possible (66:06 - 66:10)
that the I can&#39;t remember what else (66:07 - 66:14)
he he used at the time I think he had a (66:10 - 66:16)
back scalibur on his team and I do think (66:14 - 66:18)
the back Calibur was shiny so that would (66:16 - 66:20)
have been a cooler distribution but they (66:18 - 66:22)
picked the gared I don&#39;t (66:20 - 66:25)
know what the requirements so they&#39;re (66:22 - 66:26)
clearly okay with par Pokemon because (66:25 - 66:29)
they did flutter man they did Iron hands (66:26 - 66:32)
mhm they&#39;re not okay with starters (66:29 - 66:34)
there&#39;s never been like aoom and (66:32 - 66:37)
incinerar Charizard they for whatever (66:34 - 66:40)
reason starters are not okay for (66:37 - 66:44)
distribution purposes and legendaries (66:40 - 66:47)
are not okay for distribution purposes (66:44 - 66:50)
but we did get a grim snarl like six (66:47 - 66:52)
months ago that was shiny that did win a (66:50 - 66:56)
tournament and then right before (66:52 - 66:59)
the Mewtwo event we got a shiny Arcanine (66:56 - 67:03)
which again won a tournament so we&#39;ve (66:59 - 67:05)
gotten two last year none this year but (67:03 - 67:08)
it&#39;s only May when did we get the man (67:05 - 67:10)
maybe this was like a few years ago we (67:08 - 67:13)
got there was a shiny amongus at one (67:10 - 67:16)
point I thought that that was a Korean (67:13 - 67:19)
Champion I believe right I thought that (67:16 - 67:20)
was during was that during Scarlet (67:19 - 67:22)
Violet that might have been during (67:20 - 67:26)
sword think that was scarl (67:22 - 67:30)
Shi okay the years it just melt (67:26 - 67:33)
together you know we haven&#39;t gotten you (67:30 - 67:35)
we&#39;re really missing out on gastrodon we (67:33 - 67:36)
really need gastron to win a couple more (67:35 - 67:39)
tournaments we don&#39;t we just don&#39;t have (67:36 - 67:41)
enough of those we don&#39;t have a shiny (67:39 - 67:43)
one yet in this game yeah everyone&#39;s (67:41 - 67:46)
winning these tournaments with non shiny (67:43 - 67:49)
[Laughter] (67:46 - 67:49)
gastrodons that&#39;s the real problem all (67:51 - 67:55)
right well I think that&#39;s that&#39;s our (67:53 - 67:57)
episode for for y&#39;all today um it&#39;s (67:55 - 68:00)
