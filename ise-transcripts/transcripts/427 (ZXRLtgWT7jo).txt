in there (2:18 - 2:21)
uh and it was brent's home office for a (2:19 - 2:22)
while and then he moved downstairs and (2:21 - 2:23)
then when this (2:22 - 2:26)
whole situation became more permanent (2:23 - 2:28)
than i wanted it to be (2:26 - 2:29)

place for my computer (2:29 - 2:33)
offices well i mean if you count the (2:31 - 2:35)
living room and office (2:33 - 2:37)

you're ready for my problem (5:06 - 5:11)
with this particular situation go (5:08 - 5:12)
describe (5:11 - 5:14)
the whole deal go go through the spiel (5:12 - 5:15)
all right all right bear (5:14 - 5:18)
walker is a master craftsman of (5:15 - 5:21)
carved wood skateboards partnering with (5:18 - 5:23)
pokemon center to create a second series (5:21 - 5:24)
of five (5:23 - 5:28)
limited edition 29 inch skateboards (5:24 - 5:30)
uh each skateboard design features one (5:28 - 5:32)
of the world's most popular poke i (5:30 - 5:35)
you know i'm not a fully agreeing with (5:32 - 5:36)
that sentence of the most popular (5:35 - 5:38)
pokemon but maybe that's there's some (5:36 - 5:39)
truth to that (5:38 - 5:41)
that's really all we know we don't know (5:39 - 5:42)
how many (5:41 - 5:45)
uh boards like there are five boards (5:42 - 5:46)
they're not saying there are only (5:45 - 5:48)
one of each board there's some pictures (5:46 - 5:50)
here and it looks like there's (5:48 - 5:52)
yeah the pictures had stacks of boards (5:50 - 5:53)
yeah it looks like shells (5:52 - 5:55)
it looks like there's plenty yeah they (5:53 - 5:57)
did sell out so this is (5:55 - 5:59)
series two series one sold out sold out (5:57 - 6:00)
in (5:59 - 6:03)
less than a day i think uh and you (6:00 - 6:04)
haven't been able to get them since and (6:03 - 6:05)
i want to say they were (6:04 - 6:09)
close to like 180 200 (6:05 - 6:13)
uh aboard most likely all you will (6:09 - 6:16)
okay issue there's a (6:13 - 6:18)
major issue that applies to everyone and (6:16 - 6:20)
a minor issue that applies to will (6:18 - 6:21)
anderson major (6:20 - 6:24)
issue unlike (6:21 - 6:28)
most skateboards you will find (6:24 - 6:32)
out in the world the art the carved (6:28 - 6:34)
pokemon and the the art is lovely (6:32 - 6:35)
beautiful (6:34 - 6:38)
the the rayquaza i think every single (6:35 - 6:40)
person who's looked at it has said wow (6:38 - 6:41)
that's fantastic (6:40 - 6:44)
toxicity debatable world's most popular (6:41 - 6:46)
pokemon (6:44 - 6:49)
either way the art is on the side of the (6:46 - 6:50)
skateboard (6:49 - 6:52)
for the uninformed i will say where you (6:50 - 6:54)
put your feet (6:52 - 6:57)
for your normal skateboarders i will say (6:54 - 7:00)
where you would cover it with grip tape (6:57 - 7:01)
you can't (7:00 - 7:03)
use these skateboards to actually (7:01 - 7:04)
skateboard (7:03 - 7:07)
no matter what they put in the pictures (7:04 - 7:08)
advertising (7:07 - 7:11)
for these skateboards i fundamentally i (7:08 - 7:12)
do not like skateboards that are (7:11 - 7:14)
produced as art pieces and not to be (7:12 - 7:16)
used as actual skateboards even if i am (7:14 - 7:17)
spending 200 (7:16 - 7:19)
for the board so that's that's the one (7:17 - 7:22)
issue the the will anderson issue (7:19 - 7:25)
is i have recently decided to (7:22 - 7:28)
improve as a self-improvement world (7:25 - 7:30)
improvement thing number one meatless (7:28 - 7:31)
mondays i'm trying not to eat any meat (7:30 - 7:32)
on mondays at all (7:31 - 7:34)
how does that apply to skateboards not (7:32 - 7:36)
at all but (7:34 - 7:39)
going hand in hand with that i'm doing (7:36 - 7:40)
no (7:39 - 7:43)
spend tuesdays (7:40 - 7:47)
i don't spend any money on (7:43 - 7:52)
tuesdays and these boards are coming out (7:47 - 7:55)
on a tuesday i mean so (7:52 - 7:57)
what happens on wasted all wednesday (7:55 - 8:00)
there you go (7:57 - 8:02)
if they're still in stock i'll be buying (8:00 - 8:05)
a toxicity skateboard but (8:02 - 8:08)
man the timing of this was just designed (8:05 - 8:10)
to make me unhappy (8:08 - 8:13)
so i i have a a couple things number one (8:10 - 8:14)
it is (8:13 - 8:17)
really weird uh to see (8:14 - 8:20)
umbreon and not espeon (8:17 - 8:22)
i can't why people like umbreon nobody (8:20 - 8:25)
likes nobody likes espeon (8:22 - 8:28)
i can't there's there's not i mean maybe (8:25 - 8:29)
if we go back (8:28 - 8:32)
18 years or however long um umbreon and (8:29 - 8:34)
espn have been out 19 years (8:32 - 8:37)
they're always together so for umbreon (8:34 - 8:39)
to get aboard and espeon not to get (8:37 - 8:41)
aboard seems a little weird (8:39 - 8:44)
uh spoiler alert for series three maybe (8:41 - 8:46)
yeah remember what was in series one it (8:44 - 8:49)
was gengar charizard pikachu (8:46 - 8:56)
mewtwo and there was another one espeon (8:49 - 8:59)
um there's a toxicity here uh there's a (8:56 - 9:00)
rayquaza there's (8:59 - 9:04)
uh espeon there's mew and then because (9:00 - 9:07)
we they needed the most radical extreme (9:04 - 9:08)
pokemon ever (9:07 - 9:11)
togepi that togepi board is cute (9:08 - 9:14)
yeah it is cute there's nothing on the (9:11 - 9:16)
underside of these boards though well (9:14 - 9:17)
mike's a great (9:16 - 9:19)
exactly right the art is supposed to go (9:17 - 9:21)
on the wheel side (9:19 - 9:22)
and then it's supposed to be relatively (9:21 - 9:24)
plain on the feet side because you're (9:22 - 9:26)
going to cover it with grip tape (9:24 - 9:28)
well i mean there is grip tape on it if (9:26 - 9:29)
you like (9:28 - 9:32)
the well toxicity has little to note if (9:29 - 9:33)
you want the board with the most grip (9:32 - 9:35)
tape you're probably going to go with mu (9:33 - 9:37)
right because though that has (9:35 - 9:40)
if you look closely at it it is like the (9:37 - 9:41)
um (9:40 - 9:44)
dotted i don't know this this art is a (9:41 - 9:45)
ba relief (9:44 - 9:48)
there is that is not grip tape that is (9:45 - 9:49)
texturing (9:48 - 9:51)
sure but that's not made out of that (9:49 - 9:53)
sandpapery stuff that's going to (9:51 - 9:56)
grind the bottom of your shoes off that (9:53 - 9:58)
i need for grip tape (9:56 - 10:01)
oh gyarados scared us yeah gyarados (9:58 - 10:04)
i totally also agree with will these are (10:01 - 10:06)
like art pieces (10:04 - 10:09)
but why why are we putting wheels on and (10:06 - 10:11)
trucks on them just (10:09 - 10:13)
just sell me the board like i have (10:11 - 10:14)
purchased boards (10:13 - 10:17)
for our to hang on to you you are the (10:14 - 10:18)
worst kind of person (10:17 - 10:21)
you are promoting this (10:18 - 10:25)
lifestyle but i but when you buy a board (10:21 - 10:27)
for art you don't need the hardware (10:25 - 10:30)
you just need the board true and the (10:27 - 10:31)
hardware here (10:30 - 10:34)
trucks wheels bearings that's (10:31 - 10:36)
like 80 dollars right there well they (10:34 - 10:38)
don't come with that stuff (10:36 - 10:40)
you you only get the deck right no you (10:38 - 10:41)
get that you get out you get it all you (10:40 - 10:42)
get what is (10:41 - 10:44)
you get the wheels the the the truck you (10:42 - 10:46)
get it all you get it assembled (10:44 - 10:48)
i mean oh it's a different okay all of (10:46 - 10:49)
these people (10:48 - 10:52)
in dress pants seem to be skateboarding (10:49 - 10:53)
just fine (10:52 - 10:55)
in these pictures they look like they're (10:53 - 10:56)
going to work (10:55 - 10:59)
a thing that doesn't happen anymore in (10:56 - 11:00)
their khakis (10:59 - 11:03)
and very clean shots well little secret (11:00 - 11:04)
for you greg which is something i've (11:03 - 11:07)
recently discovered myself (11:04 - 11:09)
is that the actual traditional (11:07 - 11:11)
skateboarding pant (11:09 - 11:14)
is dickies like dickies uh (11:11 - 11:17)
trousers not jeans trousers (11:14 - 11:19)
well i don't know what the word is for i (11:17 - 11:20)
don't want to call them chinos i don't (11:19 - 11:22)
think they're chinos (11:20 - 11:24)
they're definitely not chinos it's dicky (11:22 - 11:25)
slacks (11:24 - 11:28)
yeah they're slacks slacks so that's why (11:25 - 11:29)
they look like that (11:28 - 11:32)
yeah they're just not regular old pants (11:29 - 11:34)
vicky's pants (11:32 - 11:35)
i mean i got them now too because i'm a (11:34 - 11:38)
skateboarder (11:35 - 11:38)
just getting from the website (11:38 - 11:47)
either way i'm excited disappointed (11:43 - 11:49)
saddened by my choice to not spend money (11:47 - 11:50)
on tuesdays (11:49 - 11:52)
all of it these boards are beautiful (11:50 - 11:54)
they go against a lot of my philosophies (11:52 - 11:56)
when it comes to buying skateboards (11:54 - 11:58)
because i feel (11:56 - 12:02)
that people who buy skateboards as art (11:58 - 12:04)
make the boards themselves more (12:02 - 12:06)
expensive girl skateboards (12:04 - 12:09)
at the at the same time that this was (12:06 - 12:10)
announced girls (12:09 - 12:13)
not like what do you think i was saying (12:10 - 12:14)
well (12:13 - 12:15)
people who don't know skateboards might (12:14 - 12:17)
think like why are you doing (12:15 - 12:20)
that you say skateboards for women i (12:17 - 12:21)
said girl skateboards it's a brand of (12:20 - 12:22)
skateboard (12:21 - 12:24)
right my girl is the name of a brand you (12:22 - 12:26)
want to get something for will anderson (12:24 - 12:27)
for christmas if you (12:26 - 12:30)
buy him something from girl skateboards (12:27 - 12:30)
you'll (12:30 - 12:32)
get to put a smile on his face because (12:30 - 12:34)
girl skateboards is my (12:32 - 12:37)
skate company either way i'm currently (12:34 - 12:38)

[Applause] (15:18 - 15:21)
when you say sweater do you mean hoodie (15:19 - 15:22)
or do you mean sweater (15:21 - 15:24)
that's actually something knit because (15:22 - 15:26)
that's something that drives me (15:24 - 15:28)
up the wall around this part of the car (15:26 - 15:30)
i'm reading from silicona (15:28 - 15:34)
it looks to me as a pull over (15:30 - 15:36)
is what i would call it with a hood no (15:34 - 15:37)
zip (15:36 - 15:39)
so but it's made out of sweatshirt (15:37 - 15:41)
material uh (15:39 - 15:44)
sure i would call that a hoodie why (15:41 - 15:46)
do people in this part of the country (15:44 - 15:48)
call those sweaters (15:46 - 15:50)
they're not sweat sweaters are knit from (15:48 - 15:51)
yarn (15:50 - 15:55)
period who who calls a hoodie a sweater (15:51 - 15:57)
plenty of people i know around here i (15:55 - 16:00)
would call i would say hoodie (15:57 - 16:02)
needs a zipper no you're incorrect a (16:00 - 16:05)
hoodie is a sweatshirt material (16:02 - 16:09)
top that has a hood on it zip or no zip (16:05 - 16:11)
correct i don't like i don't like the no (16:09 - 16:12)
zip (16:11 - 16:14)
i need the zip that's your personal (16:12 - 16:15)
preference (16:14 - 16:17)
that doesn't change the nature of the (16:15 - 16:19)
item (16:17 - 16:19)
is the ryan hoodie (16:19 - 16:27)
legit if there's one thing (16:23 - 16:28)

anderson loves it's hoodies i got a (16:28 - 16:31)
closet (16:30 - 16:34)
with like literally 20 hoodies i got a (16:31 - 16:35)
hoodie (16:34 - 16:38)
for every day of the month i have just (16:35 - 16:39)
realized that i have (16:38 - 16:40)
more hoodies than i have pairs of (16:39 - 16:42)
underwear (16:40 - 16:46)
what how (16:42 - 16:50)
how what oh it is legit it's pretty good (16:46 - 16:52)
yeah the ryan is pretty good oh it's the (16:50 - 16:54)
dragon (16:52 - 16:57)
yeah nah pass 2k mickey (16:54 - 16:59)
no it is gimmicky it is it's very (16:57 - 17:00)
gimmicky it's (16:59 - 17:04)
it's it's a lot i don't hate it though (17:00 - 17:07)
i like the t-shirts it's a hoodie you (17:04 - 17:08)
would buy at hot topic (17:07 - 17:11)
in the moment mm-hmm you know where like (17:08 - 17:12)
once they were twice (17:11 - 17:14)
and then you'd be like um it's not (17:12 - 17:15)
really comfortable (17:14 - 17:18)
it kind of stands out that's like the (17:15 - 17:19)
hoodie i bought at pokemon worlds and i (17:18 - 17:21)
wore it once and i was like this is (17:19 - 17:23)
actually really ugly (17:21 - 17:24)
which hoodie did you get at worlds the (17:23 - 17:26)
one with all the (17:24 - 17:28)
it's like beige and it's like (17:26 - 17:30)
everybody's like running around looking (17:28 - 17:33)
at fossils (17:30 - 17:34)
it's not a solid color and it's not (17:33 - 17:36)
black yeah (17:34 - 17:38)
and i also think i should have gotten it (17:36 - 17:40)
as an extra large not a large but (17:38 - 17:40)
whatever (17:40 - 17:43)
choices were made poor choices someone (17:40 - 17:45)
will receive that hoodie as a donation (17:43 - 17:46)
someday (17:45 - 17:48)
all right this is off pokemon.com (17:46 - 17:50)
september (17:48 - 17:52)
16th yeah okay so i had to double check (17:50 - 17:53)
the date uh (17:52 - 17:55)
it was recently this week el cremie (17:53 - 17:56)
v-max (17:55 - 17:59)
dreadnought v-max galerion cursula v (17:56 - 18:03)
and more in pokemon tcg champions path (17:59 - 18:06)
champions path will uh arrive officially (18:03 - 18:07)
september (18:06 - 18:11)
25th i am more than positive that (18:07 - 18:13)
walmart and target does not care and if (18:11 - 18:15)
they have them in stock they're putting (18:13 - 18:17)
them on shelves (18:15 - 18:19)
so it is possible you could find them (18:17 - 18:21)
early i do expect that this set will be (18:19 - 18:23)
relatively harder to find than other (18:21 - 18:24)
sets (18:23 - 18:26)
so you have and you cannot get this set (18:24 - 18:28)
in pure booster bat (18:26 - 18:31)
pop you cannot get the set in pure (18:28 - 18:33)
booster packs or a booster box you can (18:31 - 18:35)
only get them in like blister packs or (18:33 - 18:39)
um pin collections uh or something or (18:35 - 18:40)
elite trainer boxes (18:39 - 18:41)
so we have a cursor levy we have (18:40 - 18:43)
valcremi v we have el chromie v-max (18:41 - 18:46)
dreadnough v-max whale lord v uh (18:43 - 18:50)
these are all cards that have been in (18:46 - 18:52)
past japanese sets that have already (18:50 - 18:54)
arrived this is a (18:52 - 18:58)
limited set like hidden fates or (18:54 - 19:01)
like um dragons exalted or like shining (18:58 - 19:01)
legends (19:01 - 19:04)
so there will only be about 70 cards in (19:01 - 19:07)
this set to complete (19:04 - 19:09)
and there is from my understanding a (19:07 - 19:12)
shiny charizard in the set (19:09 - 19:14)
as well as the rainbow rare charizard (19:12 - 19:15)
v-max in the set (19:14 - 19:19)
if you want your sets to sell (19:15 - 19:20)
well look they didn't need the (19:19 - 19:22)
charizards for these to sell i don't (19:20 - 19:24)
think but now there's two charizards so (19:22 - 19:26)
i don't know i don't know what the value (19:24 - 19:28)
will end up being for (19:26 - 19:30)
either of these yet because obviously (19:28 - 19:32)
the they're not out yet (19:30 - 19:34)
but they come out soon and it's not a (19:32 - 19:35)
complete (19:34 - 19:38)
release on september 25th i think elite (19:35 - 19:39)
trainer boxes and i think (19:38 - 19:41)
some of the pin collections come out the (19:39 - 19:42)
25th and then there are (19:41 - 19:44)
a different pin collections that come (19:42 - 19:46)
out in like november (19:44 - 19:50)
um so it's not it's it's not like if you (19:46 - 19:52)
miss out here you won't have an (19:50 - 19:55)
opportunity in the future (19:52 - 19:58)
should be opportunity in future uh we (19:55 - 19:59)

there's no mint island in bay bay sword (20:50 - 20:54)
and shield (20:54 - 20:56)
[Laughter] (20:54 - 20:58)
how's your bitterness level for what (20:56 - 21:00)
series five (20:58 - 21:02)
yeah still very high so they haven't (21:00 - 21:04)
made it so that i can practice (21:02 - 21:06)
in game yet nope they haven't responded (21:04 - 21:07)
to my demands (21:06 - 21:10)
nope or lack thereof yeah (21:07 - 21:13)
nope they are still running with series (21:10 - 21:14)
5 (21:13 - 21:18)
all together i i (21:14 - 21:20)
i heard this from some other people i (21:18 - 21:21)
think the intention (21:20 - 21:24)
was it to be series six as there was in (21:21 - 21:25)
pokemon home (21:24 - 21:28)
said series six and elsewhere said (21:25 - 21:28)
series six (21:28 - 21:30)
and other places then said series five (21:28 - 21:32)
and then they had to tweet (21:30 - 21:33)
saying we apologize for the confusion (21:32 - 21:36)
it's series five but the thing i (21:33 - 21:40)
heard somebody selected the wrong rules (21:36 - 21:41)
because anyone can make a tournament (21:40 - 21:45)
right you can go in people do this all (21:41 - 21:45)
the time like (21:45 - 21:48)
r slash stun fisk or r vgc (21:45 - 21:52)
or people's discords or um youtubers or (21:48 - 21:53)
streamers have made tournaments you can (21:52 - 21:55)
make a tournament and you can set the (21:53 - 21:55)
rules right (21:55 - 21:57)
you can set singles you can set doubles (21:55 - 21:59)
you can set six pokemon four pokemon (21:57 - 22:01)
three pokemon (21:59 - 22:03)
what i'm assuming is whoever at the (22:01 - 22:04)
pokemon company (22:03 - 22:08)
needed to make this tournament didn't (22:04 - 22:10)
download the series six rules (22:08 - 22:12)
and they just started the tournament (22:10 - 22:13)
series five and they (22:12 - 22:17)
probably maybe (22:13 - 22:19)
didn't want to cancel it because then (22:17 - 22:20)
people who signed up (22:19 - 22:23)
there's so the the issue is there's no (22:20 - 22:25)
way to notify people (22:23 - 22:27)
that hey we messed up you need to (22:25 - 22:30)
re-sign up after people have signed up (22:27 - 22:32)
like you can't push a notification (22:30 - 22:34)
in-game (22:32 - 22:36)
and you can't just assume that all your (22:34 - 22:37)
players use twitter (22:36 - 22:42)
check no one checks pokemon.com (22:37 - 22:42)
and you can't assume everyone uses (22:42 - 22:45)
twitter or people use (22:43 - 22:48)
check their emails or stuff so i guess (22:45 - 22:50)
it would be unfair (22:48 - 22:53)
to however many people signed up before (22:50 - 22:54)
they realized (22:53 - 22:56)
oh this should be series six we can't (22:54 - 22:58)
cancel because how are we going to tell (22:56 - 22:59)
these people that we (22:58 - 23:01)
rejected their entry and they have to (22:59 - 23:03)
re-enter again (23:01 - 23:05)
that seems really weak like their (23:03 - 23:06)
in-game news there's (23:05 - 23:09)
email there's messages like (23:06 - 23:12)
yeah i agree they could do it that that (23:09 - 23:13)
just seems like not (23:12 - 23:16)
it's not that hard they have people who (23:13 - 23:19)
like are like double checking before you (23:16 - 23:20)
hit enter (23:19 - 23:22)
or like before it's published and made (23:20 - 23:23)
production to say (23:22 - 23:25)
all right did we do is does all this (23:23 - 23:28)
check off with what we expected (23:25 - 23:31)
and if you went in and you were (23:28 - 23:32)
rejected like there's a million ways to (23:31 - 23:34)
do that like (23:32 - 23:37)
they if if it was unintentional they (23:34 - 23:38)
could fix it (23:37 - 23:41)
right they could fix it and there's no (23:38 - 23:43)
way to say that they would have no way (23:41 - 23:43)
to reach (23:43 - 23:46)
all of them i mean they could definitely (23:43 - 23:47)
send out and do their best (23:46 - 23:50)
efforts to catch most of them (23:47 - 23:54)
yeah but so like (23:50 - 23:57)
how many people are not gonna be able to (23:54 - 23:59)
play at that point like we're not (23:57 - 24:01)
talking like it's the end of the world (23:59 - 24:03)
it's getting 50 (24:01 - 24:06)
battle point it seems that if it was (24:03 - 24:07)
truly a mistake (24:06 - 24:10)
they could go through lengths of fixing (24:07 - 24:11)
it (24:10 - 24:14)
and not have it be that hard um instead (24:11 - 24:15)
of forcing (24:14 - 24:18)
like everybody to be super dissatisfied (24:15 - 24:19)
with (24:18 - 24:21)
the outcome they're not good at (24:19 - 24:22)
communication (24:21 - 24:25)
you're not wrong i mean if i if i was (24:22 - 24:28)
in charge i would say cancel it (24:25 - 24:31)
let's do our best efforts to let people (24:28 - 24:32)
know if they sign up they have to (24:31 - 24:33)
re-sign (24:32 - 24:34)
up through twitter through email through (24:33 - 24:37)
the website yeah i mean that they they (24:34 - 24:38)
notified people that the tournament was (24:37 - 24:40)
happening those same people are going to (24:38 - 24:42)
be paying attention to the same channels (24:40 - 24:45)
but i i don't know what is it like one (24:42 - 24:47)
two three ten people (24:45 - 24:49)
probably in charge of this tournament (24:47 - 24:51)
and i'm assuming one of them says ah (24:49 - 24:53)
it's probably not that big of a deal (24:51 - 24:56)
without realizing like you you also (24:53 - 24:58)
you might think it's not that big of a (24:56 - 25:00)
deal but also we have no way to par we (24:58 - 25:01)
have (25:00 - 25:05)
no way to practice for this (25:01 - 25:08)
without using showdown (25:05 - 25:10)
which they will never acknowledge or (25:08 - 25:11)
want to talk about (25:10 - 25:14)
and even when you go to showdown even (25:11 - 25:15)
when you go to show (25:14 - 25:16)
here's the other problem that we didn't (25:15 - 25:17)
bring up last week even if you go to (25:16 - 25:18)
showdown (25:17 - 25:22)
you're not guaranteed to play against (25:18 - 25:24)
series five teams there's nowhere on (25:22 - 25:26)
showdown that does that (25:24 - 25:28)
like i think there are two there are two (25:26 - 25:29)
ladders (25:28 - 25:31)
and one is like vgc 20 and then the (25:29 - 25:33)
other is like battle spot doubles (25:31 - 25:37)
and i think smogon when this (25:33 - 25:40)
happened said you if you want to (25:37 - 25:40)
practice for (25:40 - 25:44)
series 5 go to vgc 2020 (25:40 - 25:46)
channel and if you want to practice if (25:44 - 25:48)
you want to do practice for series 6 go (25:46 - 25:49)
to battle spot doubles (25:48 - 25:52)
and that's fine but nothing is stopping (25:49 - 25:56)
somebody from go using a series 6 team (25:52 - 26:00)
in a s in when you're trying to practice (25:56 - 26:02)
for series five (26:00 - 26:05)
and i would argue and probably a lot of (26:02 - 26:07)
competitive people would argue that (26:05 - 26:10)
series six teams not they're not (26:07 - 26:13)
not as good but series five teams (26:10 - 26:17)
are better i guess or more competitive (26:13 - 26:20)
than a series six team (26:17 - 26:22)
that's why they were bad right like they (26:20 - 26:24)
took the top pokemon (26:22 - 26:26)
and they banned them and so if i'm (26:24 - 26:28)
playing a team that didn't include the (26:26 - 26:30)
top pokemon (26:28 - 26:33)
i feel like i'm at an advantage and i (26:30 - 26:34)
feel like (26:33 - 26:37)
like me beating the team sure is (26:34 - 26:38)
probably fine (26:37 - 26:40)
but also like i don't need to know how (26:38 - 26:42)
to beat (26:40 - 26:45)
primarina or volcarona like i need to (26:42 - 26:47)
know how to beat togekiss dragopal (26:45 - 26:50)
uh torkel rillaboom so like (26:47 - 26:52)
it almost feels like that battle is kind (26:50 - 26:54)
of a waste of time (26:52 - 26:56)
because it's not what i need to practice (26:54 - 26:57)
against (26:56 - 26:59)
like will suggested last week you (26:57 - 27:01)
practice against friends yeah you can (26:59 - 27:03)
but if they're not if if dragopalt is (27:01 - 27:04)
giving you trouble (27:03 - 27:07)
and you go to showdown and no one's (27:04 - 27:08)
using draggapult because they're like (27:07 - 27:10)
i'm using my series 6 team like that (27:08 - 27:11)
doesn't really help (27:10 - 27:15)

i you you wasted your time watching the (30:24 - 30:28)
anime (30:27 - 30:32)
yeah look i i was i was eating b-dubs (30:28 - 30:35)
buffalo wild wings irene (30:32 - 30:38)

can we watch pokemon journeys and she (30:40 - 30:43)
said oh yeah cool let's do that (30:41 - 30:44)
i didn't know what else i wanted to (30:43 - 30:48)
watch so i put up the sun and moon anime (30:44 - 30:50)
as i waited because i couldn't start an (30:48 - 30:52)
episode of journeys without her (30:50 - 30:55)
which is where i learned that uh spoiler (30:52 - 30:57)
for the sun and moon anime from four (30:55 - 30:59)
years ago (30:57 - 31:03)
that lusa means clefable was actually (30:59 - 31:06)
lily's original clefairy and lily was (31:03 - 31:07)
upset (31:06 - 31:10)
that lusamine evolved her clefable (31:07 - 31:12)
without her permission well but how did (31:10 - 31:14)
she get her hands on it (31:12 - 31:16)
you don't just you're like walk away (31:14 - 31:18)
from your pokemon and somebody else (31:16 - 31:19)
snatches it (31:18 - 31:21)
team rocket isn't that all what the last (31:19 - 31:24)
20 years of pokemon is (31:21 - 31:24)
i mean it's just more bad mom behavior (31:25 - 31:29)
right yeah yeah they do a really (31:27 - 31:30)
well i mean i've only seen like one or (31:29 - 31:33)
two episodes with lucimine but her voice (31:30 - 31:35)
actor is really good and they (31:33 - 31:38)
um they do like a really good job (31:35 - 31:41)
of making her a bad mom but like shh (31:38 - 31:42)
like (31:41 - 31:45)
she's oblivious to it yeah i mean the (31:42 - 31:46)
anime (31:45 - 31:49)
she's a very watered down bad mom (31:46 - 31:52)
like there's a lot of people who rightly (31:49 - 31:53)
so (31:52 - 31:55)
say that the anime was designed to try (31:53 - 31:57)
to redeem lusamine's character (31:55 - 31:59)
because she's definitely not she's (31:57 - 32:01)
definitely portrayed more as (31:59 - 32:04)
i'm an overworked mom and i'm really (32:01 - 32:07)
doing all these things and it's just i'm (32:04 - 32:08)
oblivious to it (32:07 - 32:10)
instead of the games which is like no (32:08 - 32:11)
she's malicious (32:10 - 32:13)
yeah yeah yeah yeah so a lot of people (32:11 - 32:16)
are get upset that the anime really (32:13 - 32:19)
goes out of its way to try to redeem (32:16 - 32:21)
that character for (32:19 - 32:24)
marketing reasons and i think i i get it (32:21 - 32:25)
but yes (32:24 - 32:27)
she's still a bad mom but not the (32:25 - 32:28)
terrible mom she is in the gates it's (32:27 - 32:30)
also different universes (32:28 - 32:33)
so come on folks you can tell different (32:30 - 32:33)
stories (32:33 - 32:36)
in different places yep trust me (32:33 - 32:39)
disney's the little mermaid has minimal (32:36 - 32:40)

breaking news this morning (35:16 - 35:20)
celebrate the seasonal equinox in (35:18 - 35:22)
pokemon sword and pokemon shield with (35:20 - 35:24)
pokemon that evolved with the moonstone (35:22 - 35:27)
and the sunstone (35:24 - 35:30)
i'm not what's an equinox this is a dumb (35:27 - 35:33)
question it is the time of the year when (35:30 - 35:35)
both day and night are of equal length (35:33 - 35:38)
got it i thought it was when the sun the (35:35 - 35:40)
moon goes in front of the sun (35:38 - 35:42)
that is an equivalent that's an eclipse (35:40 - 35:44)
oh okay does that happen (35:42 - 35:48)
actually a lunar solar solar eclipse (35:44 - 35:51)
yeah september's seasonal equinox is up (35:48 - 35:54)
almost upon us trainers this day the day (35:51 - 35:56)
that grants us with oh it says here in (35:54 - 35:58)
the if you think i would read these (35:56 - 35:59)
articles ahead of you i think (35:58 - 36:03)
the day that grants i looked at this (35:59 - 36:04)
article for like three hours this (36:03 - 36:06)
morning making a graphic (36:04 - 36:12)
for it that is true that is true (36:06 - 36:15)
this day that grants us equal parts (36:12 - 36:17)
daylight and darkness is being (36:15 - 36:20)
commemorated in sword and shield with a (36:17 - 36:22)
max raid battle event from thursday (36:20 - 36:23)
september 17th (36:22 - 36:26)
to sunday september 20th you will (36:23 - 36:27)
encounter raids that feature (36:26 - 36:31)
the evolved featuring pokemon that will (36:27 - 36:33)
evolve either using a moonstone or a (36:31 - 36:34)
sunstone (36:33 - 36:36)
during this event be on the lookout for (36:34 - 36:38)
moonstone pokemon like clefable (36:36 - 36:40)
wigglytuff and (36:38 - 36:43)
and sun stone pokemon like blossom (36:40 - 36:46)
whimsicott and liligant and if you're (36:43 - 36:49)
extremely lucky trainers (36:46 - 36:52)
extremely not lucky extremely lucky be (36:49 - 36:53)
clear (36:52 - 36:54)
you might even encounter a shiny (36:53 - 36:56)
clefable (36:54 - 36:58)
fourth month in a row they've done like (36:56 - 36:59)
a weekend (36:58 - 37:02)
raid event yeah is it (36:59 - 37:04)
what was last month last month was (37:02 - 37:06)
pikachu for people (37:04 - 37:07)
right right right right right and then (37:06 - 37:10)
the month before that was (37:07 - 37:13)
whale lord correct (37:10 - 37:16)
oh no this is the third one and then way (37:13 - 37:18)
back in the day they did the magikarp (37:16 - 37:21)
yeah magikarp so this is the fourth one (37:18 - 37:22)
but third in a row (37:21 - 37:24)
and technically the equinox is on the (37:22 - 37:26)
22nd (37:24 - 37:28)
my still minor complaint is i feel like (37:26 - 37:30)
it just should be one (37:28 - 37:32)
day longer some people might not be able (37:30 - 37:33)
to get to play (37:32 - 37:37)
until sunday night and it ends 5 00 p.m (37:33 - 37:38)
pacific on sunday nights (37:37 - 37:40)
i don't see why going into monday is (37:38 - 37:42)
such a bad thing uh because if people (37:40 - 37:44)
really cared they would put their effort (37:42 - 37:46)
towards the things that are important (37:44 - 37:48)
okay i have to cut it off so that kids (37:46 - 37:50)
can do their homework before school on (37:48 - 37:51)
monday (37:50 - 37:53)
look pokemon company i can't drop (37:51 - 37:55)
everything (37:53 - 38:01)
one not even a full they announced this (37:55 - 38:01)
this morning they didn't even give us a (38:01 - 38:04)
heads up they never give us a heads up (38:02 - 38:05)
on this (38:04 - 38:08)
no they just drop it and go hope you're (38:05 - 38:10)
free this weekend (38:08 - 38:14)
this is a lesson to everybody that (38:10 - 38:17)
sometimes you need to let things go (38:14 - 38:20)
or it's also a lesson on time management (38:17 - 38:21)
if you (38:20 - 38:24)
really want it you'll make time (38:21 - 38:26)
the only thing that bugs me is they keep (38:24 - 38:28)
doing it over community day (38:26 - 38:31)
weekend yep they keep that (38:28 - 38:33)
that's kind of it i'm surprised the (38:31 - 38:35)
players cup two is next week and not (38:33 - 38:36)
this week because they would do that too (38:35 - 38:38)
they'd be like players cup this week (38:36 - 38:42)
and community day and i'm waiting (38:38 - 38:42)
i mean the venn diagram of everybody who (38:42 - 38:45)
wants to do those things (38:44 - 38:49)
is not a circle necessarily (38:45 - 38:51)
if it is i'm like one of the few that (38:49 - 38:54)
are in it well you're in the meaty parts (38:51 - 38:56)
that's true it's a cool uh it's a cool (38:54 - 38:58)
event um cerebe is reporting (38:56 - 39:00)
that it is the same as waylord which is (38:58 - 39:01)
a (39:00 - 39:05)
1 in 50 chance a 2 (39:01 - 39:07)
so not as generous as pikachu which was (39:05 - 39:09)
i think 8 (39:07 - 39:11)
and i believe magikarp was also 8 (39:09 - 39:12)
although (39:11 - 39:16)
uh people did complain that waylord and (39:12 - 39:17)
pikachu were a little harder to catch i (39:16 - 39:20)
think they were species catch rate (39:17 - 39:23)
um uh and it's magi (39:20 - 39:25)
i'm sure magikarp was actually species (39:23 - 39:26)
catch rate as well except magikarp is (39:25 - 39:27)
like (39:26 - 39:29)
pretty hard not to catch yeah it's super (39:27 - 39:31)
easy to get to magikarp um (39:29 - 39:34)
so uh sarah b did say that it seems that (39:31 - 39:37)
if you are the host of clefable you are (39:34 - 39:38)
a guaranteed catch (39:37 - 39:41)
and if you are the guest of somebody (39:38 - 39:45)
you have a very high increase but not (39:41 - 39:46)
guaranteed which was (39:45 - 39:49)
uh very different than the whale lord (39:46 - 39:50)
also just because we're talking about (39:49 - 39:52)
max raids (39:50 - 39:55)
there was a really good reddit post (39:52 - 39:57)
i want to say i can't remember if it was (39:55 - 39:58)
on our slash pokemon sword (39:57 - 40:01)
and shield or slash pokemon sword shield (39:58 - 40:02)
with no and (40:01 - 40:04)
um and i don't have it in front of me (40:02 - 40:06)
right now but they did (40:04 - 40:09)
i think 170 raids and tested with the (40:06 - 40:13)
dusk ball their data showed that a raid (40:09 - 40:15)
is not considered a cave (40:13 - 40:17)
and so the dust ball was not getting (40:15 - 40:19)
increased odds and (40:17 - 40:21)
what is what's that word where people (40:19 - 40:22)
believe something (40:21 - 40:26)
just because urban legend uh (40:22 - 40:28)
like specious reasoning is that is that (40:26 - 40:29)
what it is sure (40:28 - 40:32)
that sounds like a nice thing because so (40:29 - 40:34)
many people play in the evening (40:32 - 40:36)
the dust ball is boosted when you play (40:34 - 40:37)
in the evening (40:36 - 40:39)
right because it works in caves or it (40:37 - 40:42)
works when it's after like 6 p.m (40:39 - 40:45)
6 p.m 7 p.m whenever the like and rock (40:42 - 40:45)
thing is over (40:45 - 40:47)
7 p.m because i think lake and rock (40:45 - 40:48)
thing is yeah six to seven (40:47 - 40:51)
six isn't it five to six five to six (40:48 - 40:53)
yeah so six pm would be night (40:51 - 40:56)
yeah so they their data and i can't (40:53 - 40:57)
really find this anywhere it's just a (40:56 - 40:59)
bunch of data that is (40:57 - 41:01)
that they they did on reddit says that (40:59 - 41:02)
the (41:01 - 41:05)
max raid dens are not considered a cave (41:02 - 41:06)
but (41:05 - 41:08)
a dust ball would be effective if you're (41:06 - 41:09)
in a mass (41:08 - 41:11)
max raid den at night but also just use (41:09 - 41:12)
a repeat ball (41:11 - 41:16)
because it'll ring people or (41:12 - 41:18)
just use a ball that you want because (41:16 - 41:20)
it's just data exactly take that with a (41:18 - 41:21)
grain of salt (41:20 - 41:23)
i didn't do the research i read it (41:21 - 41:24)
though seemed very thorough (41:23 - 41:27)
they did a lot more raids than uh than i (41:24 - 41:28)
would have probably done (41:27 - 41:31)
to try to track down that stuff so (41:28 - 41:33)
that stuff always is always is always (41:31 - 41:35)
cool to see just like people are that (41:33 - 41:35)
are like (41:35 - 41:39)
ah i'm just gonna calculate this (41:35 - 41:42)
maths it's just for calculating how you (41:39 - 41:43)
can catch pokemon (41:42 - 41:46)
it has no other for all kids who said (41:43 - 41:48)
i when they were in school and you're (41:46 - 41:50)
like i have no use for this mathematics (41:48 - 41:51)
you're wasting my time (41:50 - 41:55)
well haven't you been proven wrong you (41:51 - 41:58)
too can see how easy it is to catch the (41:55 - 41:59)
pokemon (41:58 - 42:01)
other bit of news here is off nintendo (41:59 - 42:02)
wire (42:01 - 42:06)
new articles like a week old but (42:02 - 42:08)
new cafe mix i figured i just i was like (42:06 - 42:12)
we should probably talk about cafe mix (42:08 - 42:14)
are getting more events um so the (42:12 - 42:16)
current event going on right now that (42:14 - 42:16)

event the what torterra you know the (42:20 - 42:26)
the the pokemon with a tree on its back (42:23 - 42:27)
yeah but (42:26 - 42:29)
that that's too big to fit in that (42:27 - 42:31)
little cafe (42:29 - 42:33)
what it could be on the outside part (42:31 - 42:34)
maybe (42:33 - 42:37)
the cafe is on the torterra oh (42:34 - 42:39)
it's turtles all the way down yeah (42:37 - 42:41)

steve has no idea what that is a (42:46 - 42:52)
reference to oh that's perfectly fine (42:48 - 42:52)
[Music] (42:53 - 42:58)
last article here i'm already annoyed by (42:56 - 43:00)
the writer of this article (42:58 - 43:03)
off nintendo life i did post this on our (43:00 - 43:04)
subreddit (43:03 - 43:06)
because i originally found it on reddit (43:04 - 43:08)
and then i shared it to our subreddit r (43:06 - 43:11)
super effective is there an instruction (43:08 - 43:12)
manual for using reddit because (43:11 - 43:15)
all the kids are on there these days i (43:12 - 43:16)
can't figure that thing out (43:15 - 43:19)
step one is you have to love wasting (43:16 - 43:21)
time uh step two is you have to (43:19 - 43:25)
uh be able to see really dumb things get (43:21 - 43:26)
upvoted (43:25 - 43:29)
and then yep uh just accept that (43:26 - 43:30)
they're just these people love being (43:29 - 43:32)
wrong and number three (43:30 - 43:35)
is uh you ever have to (43:32 - 43:37)
not read the comments but that's what i (43:35 - 43:38)
mean that's that's not my (43:37 - 43:41)
so my issue with reddit is it's like i (43:38 - 43:43)
open the reddit app (43:41 - 43:45)
and i'm like i want to see what's the (43:43 - 43:46)
one that's on my phone yep (43:45 - 43:49)
okay and i'm like i want to see what's (43:46 - 43:50)
going on (43:49 - 43:53)
with it's super r slash it's super (43:50 - 43:55)
effective no just super effective no (43:53 - 43:55)
it's (43:55 - 43:57)
well that may be half my problem but (43:55 - 44:00)
it's like i'm like i i search and i look (43:57 - 44:00)
and i'm like (44:00 - 44:04)
i know it exists (44:00 - 44:04)
please take me there you gotta you gotta (44:04 - 44:08)
subscribe to the subreddit (44:07 - 44:11)
right i think i did and then you guys (44:08 - 44:14)
then when you go to the reddit app then (44:11 - 44:15)
you have your like (44:14 - 44:18)
news and then you have your home and (44:15 - 44:19)
then you have your popular the new (44:18 - 44:21)
the home is like your twitter feed it (44:19 - 44:23)
shows you all the posts (44:21 - 44:26)
aggregated from the subreddits you're (44:23 - 44:28)
subscribed to (44:26 - 44:29)
no it shows me a bunch of posts from (44:28 - 44:32)
things i never subscribed to (44:29 - 44:34)
right r science i have no interest in (44:32 - 44:35)
that no then (44:34 - 44:36)
then you're under the news then you're (44:35 - 44:38)
under the no i am on home i understand (44:36 - 44:40)
how an underline works on an iphone (44:38 - 44:42)
screen sir (44:40 - 44:44)
oh oh okay so when you sign up for (44:42 - 44:46)
reddit it auto-subscribes you to a bunch (44:44 - 44:47)
of really bad (44:46 - 44:50)
subreddits like r games which is (44:47 - 44:53)
possibly no that's impossible nothing is (44:50 - 44:55)
worse than our slash pokemon but i would (44:53 - 44:57)
say our slash games (44:55 - 44:59)
or video is it our slash video games or (44:57 - 45:00)
slash games (44:59 - 45:03)
is is probably second worse let me give (45:00 - 45:04)
you the good ones (45:03 - 45:08)
r slash uh hold my juice box that one's (45:04 - 45:09)
good (45:08 - 45:12)
r crappy design also good (45:09 - 45:16)
um r slash well that sucks pretty good (45:12 - 45:18)
r slash what could go wrong also very (45:16 - 45:20)
good but sometimes (45:18 - 45:22)
could be bad because sometimes what (45:20 - 45:24)
could go wrong is somebody getting very (45:22 - 45:25)
seriously injured and i don't want to (45:24 - 45:26)
see that (45:25 - 45:27)
so you just gotta be a little careful (45:26 - 45:29)
with that one r slash gadgets is pretty (45:27 - 45:30)
good (45:29 - 45:32)
our slash legal advice very bad but (45:30 - 45:33)
still fun to read (45:32 - 45:37)
how do i get our slash super effective (45:33 - 45:38)
you go to the search and then you just (45:37 - 45:41)
type in us but i subscribed to it why (45:38 - 45:42)
isn't there just a button for me to (45:41 - 45:45)
say this is the one i subscribed to let (45:42 - 45:47)
me go to that one (45:45 - 45:49)
well you can favorite it you got to go (45:47 - 45:51)
to your communities then which is the (45:49 - 45:51)
like four (45:51 - 45:54)
squares yeah i see that and then there's (45:51 - 45:56)
actually two circles and two squares but (45:54 - 45:57)
sure (45:56 - 46:00)
yep yep and then oh there it is there it (45:57 - 46:00)
is (46:00 - 46:02)
why is there all these other things in (46:00 - 46:04)
there that i never asked for in the (46:02 - 46:05)
first place when you sign up they put (46:04 - 46:06)
they give (46:05 - 46:07)
it's like when you sign up for twitter (46:06 - 46:08)
they're like you want to follow bill (46:07 - 46:09)
gates (46:08 - 46:12)
and you're like i don't know sure but i (46:09 - 46:15)
didn't say yes to anything (46:12 - 46:17)
i don't i don't know look that's just (46:15 - 46:18)
what comes with (46:17 - 46:20)
reddit it's like when you sign up for (46:18 - 46:21)
myspace and you're already friends with (46:20 - 46:23)
tom (46:21 - 46:24)
you didn't ask you didn't ask to be (46:23 - 46:26)
friends with thompson (46:24 - 46:29)
yeah but he was a friendly i thought tom (46:26 - 46:31)
and i were friends i know (46:29 - 46:33)
are you telling me that's not a real (46:31 - 46:35)
relationship (46:33 - 46:38)
possibly not okay (46:35 - 46:40)
okay here's the other thing will when (46:38 - 46:42)
using reddit (46:40 - 46:45)
turn off your brain turn on your anger (46:42 - 46:48)
and go to town i choose not to follow a (46:45 - 46:49)
path of anger thank you (46:48 - 46:52)
well then get off reddit our subreddit's (46:49 - 46:53)
good (46:52 - 46:55)
i'm trying to get it more active well (46:53 - 46:57)
now that i know how to find it i'll go (46:55 - 46:59)
and post all kinds of wacky things look (46:57 - 47:01)
if you want easy karma (46:59 - 47:03)
you take whatever you take the latest (47:01 - 47:04)
youtube video or whatever (47:03 - 47:06)
posted the subreddit easy karma i don't (47:04 - 47:07)
need karma (47:06 - 47:09)
oh you gotta have karma no when the (47:07 - 47:11)
world collapses (47:09 - 47:13)
and all we have to trade on the black (47:11 - 47:14)
market for (47:13 - 47:16)
milk is either going to be shiny pokemon (47:14 - 47:18)
or karma (47:16 - 47:20)
you got to have one or the other karma (47:18 - 47:21)
and the new york times (47:20 - 47:23)
will give me the news of the day and (47:21 - 47:25)
that's about it i'm just holding on to (47:23 - 47:25)
my (47:25 - 47:27)
ancient mew card for when the dark time (47:25 - 47:28)
comes because that's going to be worth (47:27 - 47:29)
millions (47:28 - 47:31)
it's going to be next year bear walker (47:29 - 47:33)
youtube skateboard (47:31 - 47:36)
yep okay i just i'm going to read this (47:33 - 47:38)
article i disagree with and i'm gonna (47:36 - 47:40)
explain why it's gonna be very logical (47:38 - 47:42)
nintendo and creatures and game freak (47:40 - 47:44)
file for a trademark for the legendary (47:42 - 47:46)
pokemon entei (47:44 - 47:48)
i want everyone to stop i know what (47:46 - 47:49)
you're thinking right away i will (47:48 - 47:51)
explain what's about to happen (47:49 - 47:53)
i'm going to read the article though (47:51 - 47:55)
which is going to (47:53 - 47:57)
say what you all are thinking but it's (47:55 - 47:58)
wrong (47:57 - 48:00)
because this person did not do any (47:58 - 48:02)
research (48:00 - 48:03)
i don't know why i pulled this article (48:02 - 48:05)
at the start of the month (48:03 - 48:07)
nintendo creatures and game freak filed (48:05 - 48:09)
for an app trademark application for (48:07 - 48:11)
entei (48:09 - 48:13)
as the name of the legendary fire type (48:11 - 48:15)
pocket monster that appeared in first (48:13 - 48:17)
gold and silver on the game boy color (48:15 - 48:20)
according to poke jungle some fans (48:17 - 48:22)
think the trademark could be a follow-up (48:20 - 48:24)
to the 2018 switch (48:22 - 48:26)
release let's go pikachu let's go eevee (48:24 - 48:28)
here are some speculations from a (48:26 - 48:30)
pokemon subreddit quote (48:28 - 48:32)
pokemon entei sounds a bit like a (48:30 - 48:33)
spin-off but it could have some (48:32 - 48:34)
connection to let's go (48:33 - 48:36)
end quote this is possibly the worst (48:34 - 48:38)
article we've ever read on this podcast (48:36 - 48:41)
wow of course we've read worse it could (48:38 - 48:43)
be anything related to pokemon (48:41 - 48:45)
just wait and see all right i'm not (48:43 - 48:46)
going to call out the author but i'm (48:45 - 48:47)
just disappointed with this article (48:46 - 48:50)
but here's the deal i'm gonna explain (48:47 - 48:52)
what's happening right now (48:50 - 48:54)
this is not this is nothing to do with (48:52 - 48:56)
let's go pikachu let's go eevee (48:54 - 48:59)
now let's start with step one we we know (48:56 - 49:01)
that the pokemon company puts two games (48:59 - 49:03)
out at once (49:01 - 49:06)
why would they just do entei exactly (49:03 - 49:09)
why why is there no ryko why is there no (49:06 - 49:10)
suicune (49:09 - 49:13)
okay so if we can get past that point (49:10 - 49:14)
mentally (49:13 - 49:16)
we go to the second point they've put (49:14 - 49:18)
pokemon on the covers of games before (49:16 - 49:22)
xerneas evil tall suicune (49:18 - 49:26)
venusaur groudon kyogre (49:22 - 49:27)
none of these pokemon have been (49:26 - 49:29)
trademarked in that way (49:27 - 49:32)
okay so again (49:29 - 49:34)
we're moving away from the let's go (49:32 - 49:35)
stuff (49:34 - 49:38)
number three let's talk about pokemon (49:35 - 49:40)
that have been trademarked (49:38 - 49:43)
not a huge list of them but specifically (49:40 - 49:44)
we can look at something (49:43 - 49:46)
if you've listened to the show for a (49:44 - 49:47)
long time you probably know what i'm (49:46 - 49:48)
about to say (49:47 - 49:51)
uh they have to trademark things that (49:48 - 49:51)
that (49:51 - 49:55)
exist in a world where people (49:51 - 49:58)
physically interact with them so this is (49:55 - 49:59)
what coined (49:58 - 50:03)
the term ultra shiny the reason (49:59 - 50:05)
ultra shiny was trademarked is because (50:03 - 50:07)
it was the name of a japanese trading (50:05 - 50:07)
card game (50:07 - 50:09)
set that released in japan it came to (50:07 - 50:11)
the united states they changed the name (50:09 - 50:12)
to (50:11 - 50:15)
hidden fates which was trademarked there (50:12 - 50:17)
have been terms in the pokemon world (50:15 - 50:19)
that have never been trademarked (50:17 - 50:22)
in in the way we're sp in in this form (50:19 - 50:23)
of trademark (50:22 - 50:26)
so that would be like cantonian (50:23 - 50:27)
gallerian (50:26 - 50:31)
alolan shiny has never been trademarked (50:27 - 50:32)
in this way (50:31 - 50:35)
uh mega evolution (50:32 - 50:37)
or mega pokemon not trademarked in that (50:35 - 50:38)
way (50:37 - 50:41)
but there have been pokemon themselves (50:38 - 50:43)
that have been trademarked (50:41 - 50:44)
in a specific way so this would be like (50:43 - 50:47)
meowth this would be the starter pokemon (50:44 - 50:51)
lapras rayquaza um and alolan vulpix (50:47 - 50:53)
have all been trademarked in this way (50:51 - 50:54)
that way would be (50:53 - 50:57)
the all those pokemon i named are (50:54 - 50:59)
mascots of pokemon centers (50:57 - 51:02)
so out of every single alolan pokemon (50:59 - 51:05)
shown only alolan vulpix was trademarked (51:02 - 51:06)
and (51:05 - 51:08)
only out of all those alolan pokemon (51:06 - 51:10)
alolan vulpix is a mascot of the (51:08 - 51:14)
sapar sapporo i believe pokemon center (51:10 - 51:17)
um rayquaza mascot of skytree (51:14 - 51:21)
lapras mascot of the pokemon center that (51:17 - 51:21)
opened in (51:21 - 51:24)
taiwan so in that sense (51:21 - 51:28)
those pokemon have been trademarked (51:24 - 51:32)
so my guess would either be (51:28 - 51:34)
my guess is that entei is going to be a (51:32 - 51:35)
mascot (51:34 - 51:37)
of a pokemon center in japan that is (51:35 - 51:40)
probably near a volcano (51:37 - 51:43)
is actually probably my guess because it (51:40 - 51:45)
is the volcano pokemon (51:43 - 51:47)
um and there would be no reason to (51:45 - 51:49)
trademark (51:47 - 51:52)
a pokemon for a toy or for a game (51:49 - 51:53)
because they've never had to do that (51:52 - 51:56)
before there's a bunch of alolan vulpix (51:53 - 51:58)
merchandise that exists (51:56 - 52:02)
and cards and it's in the anime a lot (51:58 - 52:04)
but the reason they had to trademark it (52:02 - 52:05)
was because it was a mask out of a (52:04 - 52:07)
pokemon center (52:05 - 52:11)
so uh i there's your three parts your (52:07 - 52:14)
we haven't needed a trademark pokemon (52:11 - 52:14)
why (52:14 - 52:17)
are suicune and entei not trademarked (52:14 - 52:18)
point number two we've never had to (52:17 - 52:20)
trademark pokemon that have appeared on (52:18 - 52:21)
the cover of games (52:20 - 52:22)
and then point number three here are the (52:21 - 52:23)
list of pokemon that have been (52:22 - 52:25)
trademarked and they've been related to (52:23 - 52:28)
physical real world products like a (52:25 - 52:29)
pokemon center that you would visit (52:28 - 52:31)
that's all reasonable and it makes sense (52:29 - 52:33)
i'm actually shocked (52:31 - 52:36)
i'm so excited for let's go entei though (52:33 - 52:37)
i really can't wait for monday's (52:36 - 52:39)
announcement (52:37 - 52:39)
i can't i mean it's going to be in the (52:39 - 52:43)
mini showcase of other developers and (52:41 - 52:44)
they're going to sneak it in in the end (52:43 - 52:45)
because (52:44 - 52:47)
because game freak is a is another (52:45 - 52:48)
developer (52:47 - 52:51)
and then it's going to be um diamond in (52:48 - 52:53)
pro remakes confirmed because entei is (52:51 - 52:54)
going to be (52:53 - 52:58)
a new mascot in um ultra platinum shiny (52:54 - 53:00)
uh the only other thing i thought which (52:58 - 53:02)
might be a stretch because again i don't (53:00 - 53:02)
think (53:02 - 53:04)
pokemon needed to be trademarked to be (53:02 - 53:07)
in featured in movies (53:04 - 53:09)
but they did redo the first pokemon (53:07 - 53:10)
movie they did redo (53:09 - 53:13)
the second pokemon movie technically (53:10 - 53:15)
technically on both of those (53:13 - 53:16)
well the first one's not technically (53:15 - 53:18)
they definitely redid the first pokemon (53:16 - 53:19)
movie (53:18 - 53:21)
the second one they just stole the name (53:19 - 53:23)
and put lukie on it for five seconds (53:21 - 53:26)
[Laughter] (53:23 - 53:29)
oh that movie's so bad entei (53:26 - 53:32)
is while it is a fake entei in the third (53:29 - 53:34)
movie it's just an illusion created by (53:32 - 53:35)
the unknown (53:34 - 53:38)
it is in the third movie that would be (53:35 - 53:42)
maybe my other guess they want to do (53:38 - 53:43)
that (53:42 - 53:45)
maybe oddly enough the pokemon now that (53:43 - 53:46)
i'm thinking about that oddly enough the (53:45 - 53:48)
pokemon center also released a bunch of (53:46 - 53:51)
unknown merchandises (53:48 - 53:51)
[Applause] (53:51 - 53:56)
now the pieces are coming together but i (53:53 - 53:56)
don't (53:56 - 53:58)
think you i don't think you need a (53:56 - 54:01)
trademark for movie though (53:58 - 54:05)
because if they did oh we don't know law (54:01 - 54:11)
except for greg's lawyers yeah (54:05 - 54:14)
my doctorate mastery of lawyering that i (54:11 - 54:15)
have (54:14 - 54:18)
but i don't deal i don't deal in movie (54:15 - 54:18)
layering (54:18 - 54:22)
i only deal with podcast lawyering so (54:18 - 54:26)
question of the week (54:22 - 54:26)
question question gotta ask the question (54:27 - 54:34)
everybody's looking for the question of (54:31 - 54:36)

make so many quality of life (55:10 - 55:14)
improvements (55:13 - 55:15)
we're going to add more rocks because (55:14 - 55:17)
it's going to annoy steve all of it i (55:15 - 55:18)
have a (55:17 - 55:20)
bold vision and then we're gonna start (55:18 - 55:22)
the massive pokemon mmo project (55:20 - 55:25)
and then i will be fired in 2023 but (55:22 - 55:26)
that's (55:25 - 55:29)
fine because i made my mark on the world (55:26 - 55:33)
i would like to work in um story and (55:29 - 55:35)
basically production that way of (55:33 - 55:37)
actually contributing to (55:35 - 55:39)
the actual cohesiveness of an actual (55:37 - 55:40)
good pokemon story (55:39 - 55:42)
just you know i don't have big dreams (55:40 - 55:45)
i'll be happy to work in the background (55:42 - 55:46)
this probably sounds dumb i would want (55:45 - 55:48)
to be the dude that (55:46 - 55:51)
is in charge of making sure every all (55:48 - 55:53)
like all the pieces (55:51 - 55:56)
fit together of like this is how we say (55:53 - 55:57)
the pokemon's name (55:56 - 56:00)
this is this is the pokemons like lore (55:57 - 56:02)
this is how it's connected this is (56:00 - 56:04)
legendary this is mythical this is ultra (56:02 - 56:06)
beast this is baby (56:04 - 56:09)
this is starters why so you want to you (56:06 - 56:11)
want to write the continuity manual (56:09 - 56:13)
yeah continuity like why did they say (56:11 - 56:16)
the red gyarados and the one episode and (56:13 - 56:16)
then like (56:16 - 56:19)
four episodes later they say shiny which (56:16 - 56:21)
happened recently i don't want to spoil (56:19 - 56:24)
it for anyone for the netflix stuff but (56:21 - 56:27)
greg knows what i'm talking about oh yes (56:24 - 56:31)
i mean i kind of get why they said red (56:27 - 56:35)
yeah i mean it was red colored but (56:31 - 56:38)
i um the whole (56:35 - 56:40)
i texted you about this it's spoiled (56:38 - 56:42)
territory all right can we (56:40 - 56:44)
put a spoiler warning for for the first (56:42 - 56:45)
like spoiler spoiler this this spoiler (56:44 - 56:46)
warning for the (56:45 - 56:50)
first 15 episodes of pokemon journeys on (56:46 - 56:51)
netflix (56:50 - 56:55)
all right so in episode 12 you 13 (56:51 - 56:59)
13 no it's 12 and 13 technically (56:55 - 57:00)
because they leave it they leave a (56:59 - 57:02)
cliffhanger (57:00 - 57:04)
right okay because they leave the (57:02 - 57:06)
cliffhanger (57:04 - 57:08)
yeah so 12 and so 12 to 13 is the (57:06 - 57:09)
dreadnaught (57:08 - 57:12)
cliffhanger right yeah and then (57:09 - 57:14)
the introduction of the one character is (57:12 - 57:16)
in 14 right right yep (57:14 - 57:20)
yeah okay so in episode 12 (57:16 - 57:23)
ash and go get tickets to see (57:20 - 57:26)
the world championship yep and that is (57:23 - 57:26)
between (57:26 - 57:29)
lance the dragon type trainer from (57:26 - 57:31)
the uh why am i why am i explaining who (57:29 - 57:35)
lance is everybody knows who lance is (57:31 - 57:36)
the dragon guy that doesn't have enough (57:35 - 57:38)
dragon types correct next (57:36 - 57:41)
against leon side note (57:38 - 57:44)
lance's voice actor i wasn't impressed (57:41 - 57:46)
with leon's voice actor very good (57:44 - 57:50)
yeah are we agree with that okay (57:46 - 57:53)
and so it ended up being charizard (57:50 - 57:56)
obviously from leon vs gyarados (57:53 - 57:59)
which yeah when at first i was like why (57:56 - 58:01)
is this not dragonite and then i was (57:59 - 58:02)
like well that's nice because (58:01 - 58:05)
the reason lance has gyarados is because (58:02 - 58:07)
of like lance appears in the (58:05 - 58:09)
like a rage and helps save the gyarados (58:07 - 58:10)
and like gets rid of all the (58:09 - 58:13)
like it's a really nice nod to you know (58:10 - 58:14)
the con (58:13 - 58:15)
the continuity i don't know the (58:14 - 58:17)
continuation from (58:15 - 58:20)
red and blue to gold and silver and it's (58:17 - 58:22)
a shiny gyarados it's the red one (58:20 - 58:26)
again like a rage and it sparkles (58:22 - 58:28)
kind of like the x and y sparkles when (58:26 - 58:30)
it comes out ash is it either ash or (58:28 - 58:31)
gogo (58:30 - 58:35)
wow a red gyarados yeah i think it's go (58:31 - 58:38)
i guess technically in so in diamond on (58:35 - 58:40)
pearl (58:38 - 58:42)
no i know there's we're not talking (58:40 - 58:44)
about remakes here i know people are (58:42 - 58:45)
like diamond pearls (58:44 - 58:46)
[Music] (58:45 - 58:48)
if you remember the beginning of the (58:46 - 58:50)
game if you went to like the tv (58:48 - 58:53)
i think bef before you like went on your (58:50 - 58:54)
adventure (58:53 - 58:57)
it would say or was it the tv or is the (58:54 - 58:59)
radio one of the two would be like (58:57 - 59:02)
we we heard reports or whatever from (58:59 - 59:04)
like a red gear it specifically (59:02 - 59:07)
says red gyarados yeah it does um and (59:04 - 59:09)
it's like really subtle and if you're (59:07 - 59:10)
not paying attention (59:09 - 59:12)
or you haven't played the beginning of (59:10 - 59:14)
diamond pearl in the last like 15 years (59:12 - 59:15)
you (59:14 - 59:16)
probably don't remember that part (59:15 - 59:18)
because it's so insignificant so that's (59:16 - 59:20)
my only maybe reason why (59:18 - 59:23)
they decided to say red gyarados (59:20 - 59:25)
also gen 4 remakes confirmed yeah but (59:23 - 59:27)
it's going to be called let's go entei (59:25 - 59:31)
right but be placed in gen 4. yep (59:27 - 59:32)
they're they're breaking all the (59:31 - 59:34)
patterns yeah so greg texted me and said (59:32 - 59:36)
have they ever said the word shiny (59:34 - 59:38)
in an anime episode out loud and i (59:36 - 59:40)
cannot remember (59:38 - 59:42)
i couldn't think of one even when not (59:40 - 59:44)
even when knock towel was shiny that (59:42 - 59:45)
entire season (59:44 - 59:48)
they said special they said special or (59:45 - 59:50)
clever little knocktowel (59:48 - 59:54)
um and then i remember lily has (59:50 - 59:57)
shiny spoilers for older episodes of (59:54 - 59:57)
anime (59:57 - 60:01)
lily has a shiny magirna (59:57 - 60:03)
which no one really knew what was shiny (60:01 - 60:05)
until the pokemon home files got (60:03 - 60:06)
released (60:05 - 60:09)
because mcgiron technically didn't have (60:06 - 60:11)
a shiny (60:09 - 60:14)
that we knew of but so everyone was like (60:11 - 60:15)
oh her mcgearn is just a weird color (60:14 - 60:16)
which is not (60:15 - 60:18)
weird for the anime because remember (60:16 - 60:20)
like the pink butterfree from the first (60:18 - 60:21)
season that (60:20 - 60:24)
wasn't shiny so that wasn't inherently (60:21 - 60:25)
weird (60:24 - 60:27)
but they didn't acknowledge it was shiny (60:25 - 60:29)
and then i remember the um (60:27 - 60:32)
what's his name like horror horricopus (60:29 - 60:35)
or whatever the he's like the evil (60:32 - 60:38)
i have no idea he's the evil dude who (60:35 - 60:41)
who appears at the end of the season 20 (60:38 - 60:43)
anime and (60:41 - 60:46)
uh sophocles aesthetic i can't remember (60:43 - 60:47)
his name right now sophie cleveland (60:46 - 60:50)
races his charger bug against him (60:47 - 60:53)
but his charger bug (60:50 - 60:53)
his charge bug is shiny but they (60:54 - 60:58)
never acknowledge it they don't even (60:57 - 61:00)
like acknowledge that he's holding (60:58 - 61:03)
like a pokemon they're just like he just (61:00 - 61:04)
has (61:03 - 61:09)
i'm looking up his name horus horacio (61:04 - 61:12)
horatio (61:09 - 61:12)
horatio is that a real name (61:12 - 61:19)
yes horatio hornblower (61:16 - 61:23)
which will forever not be orca (61:19 - 61:23)
there's not even a c in that (61:24 - 61:27)
he has a shiny charge bug (61:28 - 61:35)
they never say it at least unless he (61:31 - 61:35)
comes back (61:35 - 61:39)
later i explained to you why they never (61:35 - 61:42)
point out that yeah i think (61:39 - 61:46)
this is a one-and-done (61:42 - 61:46)
so okay so in episode 14 (61:48 - 61:54)
it's yeah it's the episode where they go (61:51 - 61:55)
to (61:54 - 61:57)
unova they say it really fast and really (61:55 - 61:58)
aggressive yeah (61:57 - 62:01)
unova you know they're in the unova (61:58 - 62:02)
region (62:01 - 62:06)
and uh ash and golf (62:02 - 62:08)
save oh gosh what is that dude's name (62:06 - 62:09)
his name is like (62:08 - 62:12)
jimmy or something they saved they saved (62:09 - 62:14)
this dude from a cafe regis (62:12 - 62:16)
yes and they say it correctly in the (62:14 - 62:18)
anime people (62:16 - 62:20)
yes coffee grigas who's saying coffee (62:18 - 62:22)
great is wrong at this point (62:20 - 62:25)
oh there is a certain complete pokedex (62:22 - 62:26)
rap (62:25 - 62:28)
that a certain popular internet person (62:26 - 62:30)
did and they say it completely wrong (62:28 - 62:33)
ruining the entire thing i don't know (62:30 - 62:34)
what that is (62:33 - 62:37)
anyways fine there's two (62:34 - 62:40)
there's two coffee grigas and the little (62:37 - 62:42)
the boy pops out and then a blue psyduck (62:40 - 62:43)
pops out (62:42 - 62:46)
a shiny psyduck and i think it's go goes (62:43 - 62:47)
wow (62:46 - 62:50)
a blue psyduck yeah (62:47 - 62:53)
and then uh the boy maybe (62:50 - 62:56)
maybe the maybe just i i can't imagine (62:53 - 62:57)
that go (62:56 - 62:58)
like they know what when he explains (62:57 - 63:00)
what a shiny is he goes oh this is the (62:58 - 63:01)
first (63:00 - 63:03)
my first pokemon i'm pretty sure his (63:01 - 63:05)
exact words are my first pokemon was a (63:03 - 63:06)
shiny pokemon (63:05 - 63:08)
yeah well because they at the quiz him (63:06 - 63:10)
why he because he says he's only going (63:08 - 63:12)
to fill out his pokedex by collecting (63:10 - 63:13)
shiny (63:12 - 63:15)
and he says and he has like he has like (63:13 - 63:16)
10 pokemon (63:15 - 63:18)
yeah he says when you're first when the (63:16 - 63:20)
first pokemon you encountered was a (63:18 - 63:23)
shiny pokemon it's a sign (63:20 - 63:24)
that you should follow that path or (63:23 - 63:28)
something and that's when i texted steve (63:24 - 63:29)
i'm like what what (63:28 - 63:32)
what they actually said these words (63:29 - 63:34)
do you think there's people out there (63:32 - 63:35)
who like when (63:34 - 63:38)
starters aren't shiny locked their first (63:35 - 63:38)
one that they pick (63:38 - 63:41)
is shiny and they don't even realize it (63:38 - 63:42)
oh maybe (63:41 - 63:46)
100 yeah well they sell they saw how (63:42 - 63:48)
many like 15 million games (63:46 - 63:51)
one in 8 000 chance at least prior to (63:48 - 63:53)
gen 6 there are tons of people that (63:51 - 63:55)
probably have shinies that have no clue (63:53 - 63:57)
what they are all right i'm pulling up (63:55 - 63:58)
i'm pulling up the episode (63:57 - 64:01)

shane his name is shane shane shane (64:12 - 64:18)
seeker his last name is seeker (64:15 - 64:22)
uh okay so um according to bulbapedia (64:18 - 64:24)
here this episode is (64:22 - 64:25)
marks the first appearance of a number (64:24 - 64:28)
of species with long abs (64:25 - 64:32)
absences uh meditate was uh 565 episodes (64:28 - 64:33)
ago (64:32 - 64:36)
cough agrigus was 378 episodes ago yeah (64:33 - 64:38)
mass 300 episodes (64:36 - 64:39)
slack wait there's a slack off in this (64:38 - 64:41)
episode (64:39 - 64:43)
oh cause he's in the pokedex yeah 298 (64:41 - 64:44)
episodes ago (64:43 - 64:47)
woo bat also can we hold on ash got (64:44 - 64:49)
really excited to catch the woof head (64:47 - 64:52)
i know out of all the pokemon so far (64:49 - 64:53)
this up and (64:52 - 64:55)
this is in the series like the first one (64:53 - 64:56)
where he's like (64:55 - 64:59)
very excited for is like oh a woo bat (64:56 - 65:01)
this one's mine (64:59 - 65:01)
what are you doing man (65:02 - 65:05)
uh this episode features the most shiny (65:06 - 65:10)
pokemon in an anime a total of (65:08 - 65:12)
five four of them only appear through (65:10 - 65:14)
images yeah (65:12 - 65:15)
so it doesn't say anything about this is (65:14 - 65:17)
the first time they use the term shiny (65:15 - 65:17)
so if (65:17 - 65:19)
if you know if that you can think of an (65:17 - 65:21)
episode please let us know i can't think (65:19 - 65:23)
of a time in the anime that they (65:21 - 65:25)
specifically said shiny (65:23 - 65:28)
and referred to multiple shinies they've (65:25 - 65:30)
always called them oh that's a blue or (65:28 - 65:32)
that's a red yeah (65:30 - 65:34)
i can't think of until this time but now (65:32 - 65:37)
you know shiny confirmed like (65:34 - 65:40)
official anime i mean i guess it's how (65:37 - 65:42)
people would talk though right (65:40 - 65:44)
like if you don't know what a shiny is (65:42 - 65:46)
and you're playing pokemon go (65:44 - 65:48)
and it sparkles and you're not informed (65:46 - 65:50)
you would probably be like oh (65:48 - 65:54)
i got i got a blue i got a pink whale (65:50 - 65:57)
yeah it's normally blue so i guess that (65:54 - 65:58)
makes sense but like (65:57 - 66:00)
once he started explaining shinies ash (65:58 - 66:02)
and go were like oh yeah we know what (66:00 - 66:02)
those are (66:02 - 66:06)
we know all about that but that like (66:02 - 66:08)
but then who in the world officially (66:06 - 66:10)
dubbed them shiny like there's a (66:08 - 66:13)
we need to explore the deep lore of who (66:10 - 66:16)
who who first named them in the world (66:13 - 66:18)
was it shane (66:16 - 66:20)
did shane go on uh pokemon world reddit (66:18 - 66:21)

[Laughter] (66:27 - 66:31)

this world is getting up votes (66:31 - 66:36)
yep yeah yeah yeah karma toads well (66:33 - 66:38)
i'm i must not exist in this world (66:36 - 66:39)
because i don't think i've ever gotten (66:38 - 66:42)
an upvote in my entire existence (66:39 - 66:44)
so i'll give you an upvote so shane has (66:42 - 66:46)
uh shiny onyx (66:44 - 66:49)
a shiny swine nub a shiny slack off and (66:46 - 66:50)
a shiny bag gun (66:49 - 66:54)
yep i think it's pretty good yeah (66:50 - 66:57)
he said he just started too yeah and (66:54 - 67:00)
he's like what maybe 12 so (66:57 - 67:01)
he's been running around in circles for (67:00 - 67:04)
a while and then i liked when they were (67:01 - 67:07)
doing the the battle against golurk (67:04 - 67:08)

also still spoiler territory is go lurk (67:20 - 67:25)
permanently stuck in that transformed (67:23 - 67:27)
was that what we learned at the end (67:25 - 67:30)
no i think he caught it he caught it but (67:27 - 67:32)
when they released it in the park (67:30 - 67:34)
it still didn't have legs oh i haven't (67:32 - 67:36)
gotten that far (67:34 - 67:37)
i don't know how did you not finish the (67:36 - 67:39)
episode oh wait (67:37 - 67:42)
the park oh yeah mean (67:39 - 67:45)
i thought he was just resting yeah he (67:42 - 67:46)
still doesn't have legs though (67:45 - 67:48)
hey look he's still in the non-like form (67:46 - 67:50)
i'm like (67:48 - 67:52)
he couldn't make his legs vanished you (67:50 - 67:55)
don't know what ghosts can and cannot do (67:52 - 67:58)
you don't make the ghost rules we need (67:55 - 68:01)
we need to consult hercopus (67:58 - 68:02)
yeah i'll get orca puss on the phone you (68:01 - 68:04)
can hark up us on the line and find out (68:02 - 68:04)
what (68:04 - 68:08)
what really is also (68:04 - 68:10)
they spell it they spell horatio wrong (68:08 - 68:11)
in the anime because they spell it with (68:10 - 68:12)
the c (68:11 - 68:13)
see i told you to see in there that's (68:12 - 68:16)
why i was trying to say it that way (68:13 - 68:19)
there's still no puss i don't remember i (68:16 - 68:21)
don't know where that part came from (68:19 - 68:24)
but i would i would like going back to (68:21 - 68:25)
the question (68:24 - 68:28)
i was like how did we get here how did (68:25 - 68:29)
we would you like to be in charge of (68:28 - 68:30)
continuity (68:29 - 68:32)
yes i would like to be in charge of (68:30 - 68:35)
continuity when i'm ceo i will put you (68:32 - 68:37)
in charge of continuity (68:35 - 68:40)
i i feel like i feel like at the pokemon (68:37 - 68:41)
company (68:40 - 68:43)
from the outside we probably this is (68:41 - 68:45)
this is how it is for every game right (68:43 - 68:47)
from the outside you're like oh they (68:45 - 68:49)
clearly had an obvious plan (68:47 - 68:51)
but on the inside on the inside it's (68:49 - 68:53)
chaos yeah i'm sure it's all chaos and (68:51 - 68:55)
somebody's on the phone being like how (68:53 - 68:57)
do we say this giant (68:55 - 69:00)
green dragon from the sky which is the (68:57 - 69:02)
right way (69:00 - 69:05)
raymond quasar uh i'm sure what you want (69:02 - 69:06)
to write is you want to write the (69:05 - 69:07)
official (69:06 - 69:10)
pokemon continuity bible the one that (69:07 - 69:12)
everybody has to (69:10 - 69:14)
consult right on anything pokemon (69:12 - 69:15)
related (69:14 - 69:17)
i want perfect these are all the babies (69:15 - 69:19)
these are all the ultra beasts (69:17 - 69:22)
i'm still in the camp that cosmog is not (69:19 - 69:23)
an ultra beast i know people (69:22 - 69:26)
think it is still in the camp i want to (69:23 - 69:29)
also state that one of the arguments (69:26 - 69:31)
used against me was (69:29 - 69:34)
well they say the the professor goes (69:31 - 69:37)
well that that looks like an ultra beast (69:34 - 69:39)
and literally in the same episode (69:37 - 69:41)
like 10 minutes later the the narrator (69:39 - 69:42)
goes (69:41 - 69:44)
we still don't know if cosmog is an (69:42 - 69:45)
ultra beast (69:44 - 69:47)
no one gave me that part of the episode (69:45 - 69:49)
they just gave me the part of the (69:47 - 69:50)
episode where she says i think it's an (69:49 - 69:51)
ultra beast (69:50 - 69:53)
uh i still don't think cosmog is an (69:51 - 69:56)
ultra beast i'm gonna die on that hill (69:53 - 69:58)
you just think it's what it's a (69:56 - 70:00)
legendary pokemon (69:58 - 70:01)
because that's why i was featured in the (70:00 - 70:03)
year of legendary (70:01 - 70:04)
so here here are my here here are my (70:03 - 70:07)
arguments okay okay so (70:04 - 70:09)
aether foundation believes it's the type (70:07 - 70:10)
of ultra beast because it can open (70:09 - 70:13)
ultra hormones yes and your thing is the (70:10 - 70:15)
ultra wormhole is just a weird power (70:13 - 70:17)
that this legendary has (70:15 - 70:21)
is that accurate yes okay (70:17 - 70:25)
i agree with steve because (70:21 - 70:28)
because cosmog evolves (70:25 - 70:31)
into luna or solgaleo which (70:28 - 70:35)
are the legendary pokemon of alola (70:31 - 70:37)
yeah if it was an ultra beast then it (70:35 - 70:38)
wouldn't be (70:37 - 70:41)
in their traditions when they did the (70:38 - 70:43)
year of legendary which was (70:41 - 70:47)
2000 because the euro mythical was 2016. (70:43 - 70:51)
featured lunala solgaleo type null (70:47 - 70:54)
silvally cosmog cosmoem but no ultra (70:51 - 70:56)
beasts on that list (70:54 - 70:57)
so was there another legendary oh the (70:56 - 70:59)
tapus all the tapus were (70:57 - 71:01)
part of the euro just like your rayquaza (70:59 - 71:02)
your (71:01 - 71:05)
cresselia your articuno zapdos all the (71:02 - 71:06)
legendaries were featured no ultra (71:05 - 71:07)
beasts were featured (71:06 - 71:10)
necrozma was also featured on that list (71:07 - 71:13)
so that's point one on the (71:10 - 71:14)
officialpokemon.com (71:13 - 71:17)
they have no ultra beasts under the year (71:14 - 71:18)
legendary (71:17 - 71:22)
number two is every ultra beast has (71:18 - 71:25)
beast boost cosmo cosmo lunala solgaleo (71:22 - 71:28)
necrozma none of them no beast boos (71:25 - 71:29)
there's not an ultra beast that doesn't (71:28 - 71:31)
know beast boosts (71:29 - 71:33)
and there's an exception here i'll get (71:31 - 71:35)
to (71:33 - 71:38)
the exception's gonna get ya number (71:35 - 71:39)
three (71:38 - 71:42)
is that the beast ball does not (71:39 - 71:46)
increase or work on lunala (71:42 - 71:48)
or solgaleo when you catch it in (71:46 - 71:49)
ultrasound ultra moon (71:48 - 71:51)
after the game because you don't catch (71:49 - 71:52)
it pre in that game (71:51 - 71:54)
and it does not work on necro necrozma (71:52 - 71:56)
either we know that (71:54 - 71:58)
from both games that the beast ball (71:56 - 71:59)
doesn't work on these pokemon (71:58 - 72:04)
okay so number four is in the tcg (71:59 - 72:07)
an official pokemon product all of the (72:04 - 72:08)
ultra beasts (72:07 - 72:12)
in the game have a red (72:08 - 72:16)
gx text and all the non-ultra beasts (72:12 - 72:17)
have black (72:16 - 72:20)
gx text it's very subtle but there is (72:17 - 72:22)
not a single (72:20 - 72:26)
cosmog cosmoam lunala necrozma (72:22 - 72:29)
or so solgaleo card (72:26 - 72:32)
that has the red ultra bees text (72:29 - 72:34)
some of the cards just flat out say (72:32 - 72:38)
ultra beasts on them (72:34 - 72:38)
okay so this gets into the exception the (72:38 - 72:42)
only exception (72:40 - 72:46)
is when necrozma changes form (72:42 - 72:51)
to ultra necrosma that card specifically (72:46 - 72:53)
says ultra beast but there's not a (72:51 - 72:56)
single solgaleo or lunala card that says (72:53 - 72:59)
ultra beast unless okay (72:56 - 73:02)
it's ultra necrosma or unless alt (72:59 - 73:06)
or unless necrozma takes over solgaleo (73:02 - 73:07)
and lunala (73:06 - 73:10)
but that is still necrosma which is the (73:07 - 73:12)
just the general exception to the rule (73:10 - 73:13)
right because (73:12 - 73:16)
when it's dawn wings or dusk mane it is (73:13 - 73:17)
still (73:16 - 73:20)
necrosma in both the games and the tcg (73:17 - 73:21)
and all the stuff right (73:20 - 73:24)
so if anyone is the weird exception it's (73:21 - 73:25)
necrozma (73:24 - 73:27)
it's not sogalia lunala they just (73:25 - 73:28)
they're just the they just open the (73:27 - 73:30)
wormholes (73:28 - 73:32)
yeah so is the idea that alternate (73:30 - 73:34)
crosma (73:32 - 73:37)
becomes an ultra beast because it goes (73:34 - 73:39)
back to that dimension and it wasn't (73:37 - 73:43)
an ultra beast before then yes (73:39 - 73:47)
so necrozma is the absence of light (73:43 - 73:49)
so that's why that's why it comes in sun (73:47 - 73:50)
cache in (73:49 - 73:51)
in ultrasound ultra moon that's what (73:50 - 73:53)
it's looking for it's like going to (73:51 - 73:55)
absorb the sun (73:53 - 73:57)
and all the light in the alola region to (73:55 - 74:00)
get its pure its original form back (73:57 - 74:01)
right (74:00 - 74:04)
yeah but it's not an ultra beast until (74:01 - 74:05)
it goes (74:04 - 74:07)
well that's to the other dimension is (74:05 - 74:10)
that is that what we're saying (74:07 - 74:11)
no because in the in the in the ultra (74:10 - 74:13)
wormhole it also doesn't have its form (74:11 - 74:17)
right in both alola and in the (74:13 - 74:20)
wormholes it's it it's not an ultra form (74:17 - 74:24)
until what happens at the top of the (74:20 - 74:26)
tower when you climb (74:24 - 74:27)
who gives it energy i don't remember (74:26 - 74:29)
what happens (74:27 - 74:31)
i know you fight it but i don't remember (74:29 - 74:32)
how it gets all the energy (74:31 - 74:36)
i don't either here's the secret (74:32 - 74:40)
the real revelatory secret that you all (74:36 - 74:41)
have to know i think steve you have to (74:40 - 74:43)
close your ears because i don't think (74:41 - 74:44)
you can handle this (74:43 - 74:47)
oh yeah (74:44 - 74:48)
[Applause] (74:47 - 74:51)
it's all completely arbitrary and made (74:48 - 74:52)
up (74:51 - 74:55)
and none of it has to be could because (74:52 - 74:57)
you do not work for tpci yet (74:55 - 75:00)
not yet there is no continuity (74:57 - 75:01)
consistency (75:00 - 75:03)
you slap whatever labels you want on it (75:01 - 75:05)
tomorrow they'll change their minds and (75:03 - 75:06)
put a different label on it it's (75:05 - 75:10)
completely arbitrary there is no (75:06 - 75:13)
grand physics of the pokemon universe (75:10 - 75:16)
there's no grand taxonomy today i'm an (75:13 - 75:17)
ultra beast (75:16 - 75:22)
tomorrow i'm a mythical it's (75:17 - 75:22)
you're you're losing money by (75:22 - 75:27)
spending thought power thinking about (75:25 - 75:28)
these things (75:27 - 75:32)
this is all correct (75:28 - 75:32)
necrozma's not this weird exception (75:32 - 75:35)
though right maltan is a mythical (75:34 - 75:37)
pokemon that can evolve (75:35 - 75:40)
manafee is a mythical pokemon that can (75:37 - 75:41)
breed (75:40 - 75:43)
you know there wasn't legendary pokemon (75:41 - 75:44)
that could evolve and then (75:43 - 75:47)
you know we have type null probably (75:44 - 75:48)
something else right (75:47 - 75:52)
type null evolves uh something else (75:48 - 75:52)
evolves (75:52 - 75:55)
i mean cosmog evolves yeah cosbog yeah (75:52 - 75:57)
cosmog evolves so (75:55 - 75:59)
there's definitely exceptions there's (75:57 - 76:00)
all these exceptions (75:59 - 76:03)
it's fine but there ain't no one at (76:00 - 76:04)
least that i know of at the pokemon (76:03 - 76:06)
company trying to put all these together (76:04 - 76:09)
and keep it straight someday that will (76:06 - 76:10)
be your job (76:09 - 76:13)
yep pokemon of the week (76:10 - 76:16)
all right i i'm so disappointed i almost (76:13 - 76:18)
didn't want to give (76:16 - 76:20)
a new pokemon this week just because (76:18 - 76:21)
literally (76:20 - 76:24)
no one was able to guess or at least (76:21 - 76:25)
none of the people that normally write (76:24 - 76:26)
to me (76:25 - 76:27)
to give me their guesses of what the (76:26 - 76:29)
pokemon of the week is i didn't get none (76:27 - 76:31)
of that and i (76:29 - 76:33)
literally could not have made this any (76:31 - 76:35)
easier (76:33 - 76:37)
and i will say before i repeat the clue (76:35 - 76:39)
from last week (76:37 - 76:40)
the thing that i think i've said (76:39 - 76:42)
numerous times forgive me if i have (76:40 - 76:44)
never said this before but i think i (76:42 - 76:45)
have (76:44 - 76:48)
uh you have to listen to all of (76:45 - 76:51)
the words that i say because if you (76:48 - 76:53)
listen to all of the words (76:51 - 76:56)
then you'll get it and this is like and (76:53 - 76:57)
i will throw back to last week which i (76:56 - 77:00)
didn't mention for amara (76:57 - 77:03)
literally the first thing i said was (77:00 - 77:06)
i wanted to write 680 words (77:03 - 77:09)
eight 680 more words for this but here (77:06 - 77:12)
are 18. if you add 680 (77:09 - 77:15)
to 18 you get 698 which is the pokedex (77:12 - 77:17)
number for amora i could not have made (77:15 - 77:18)
that easier for you people (77:17 - 77:20)
anyways this week i thought that (77:18 - 77:21)
tomorrow one was easy (77:20 - 77:25)
i'm so angry this week's clue is (77:21 - 77:28)
one letter of all the pokemon unless i (77:25 - 77:30)
am grievously mistaken (77:28 - 77:32)
there is only one that can in any (77:30 - 77:33)
language (77:32 - 77:37)
let me repeat that part in any language (77:33 - 77:41)
be clearly identified by one letter (77:37 - 77:44)
all right gentlemen give me your guesses (77:41 - 77:46)
it's (77:44 - 77:51)
chat it's not cheddar (77:46 - 77:54)
i don't know this one's unknown to me (77:51 - 77:54)
well it's not unknown (77:54 - 77:58)
[Laughter] (77:55 - 78:01)
all right let me give you a little more (77:58 - 78:05)
uh a little more background um (78:01 - 78:07)
how many languages is pokemon available (78:05 - 78:08)
in (78:07 - 78:11)
18 12. no it's like (78:08 - 78:15)
six dude we talking tcg or (78:11 - 78:18)
oh we're talking again (78:15 - 78:18)
pokemon is available in japanese french (78:19 - 78:23)
spanish (78:22 - 78:26)
german italian korean cantonese chinese (78:23 - 78:27)
mandarin chinese (78:26 - 78:30)
i guess hindi and thai that's new to me (78:27 - 78:31)
but (78:30 - 78:34)
of all those languages do they all use (78:31 - 78:34)
the (78:34 - 78:37)
latin alphabet the answer is no they (78:34 - 78:39)
don't use the latin alphabet in japanese (78:37 - 78:40)
or chinese (78:39 - 78:43)
or korean but (78:40 - 78:46)
when this particular pokemon's name is (78:43 - 78:47)
written (78:46 - 78:50)
using japanese writing korean writing (78:47 - 78:52)
chinese writing (78:50 - 78:55)
they always use the roman (78:52 - 78:59)
letter z no matter what language you (78:55 - 78:59)
look at (78:59 - 79:03)
porygon z there's always a z (78:59 - 79:05)
in its name and that would be the (79:03 - 79:07)
pokemon of the week and (79:05 - 79:10)
also it's dagnabbit pouring on community (79:07 - 79:13)
day this weekend (79:10 - 79:16)

it's zygarde uh it is the first trivia (79:35 - 79:41)
of on bulbapedia porygon z is the only (79:39 - 79:43)
pokemon whose japanese name is spelled (79:41 - 79:44)
with a special character from a foreign (79:43 - 79:45)
alphabet (79:44 - 79:49)
there you go oregon z weighs exactly as (79:45 - 79:49)
much as (79:49 - 79:53)
dawn what it shares similarities with (79:49 - 79:55)
weave oil and alolan marowak (79:53 - 79:57)
these are the important facts that you (79:55 - 79:59)
need to know dubious (79:57 - 80:02)
disc applies implies that porygon z (79:59 - 80:04)
unlike its pre-evolution was not (80:02 - 80:06)
authorized by silphco (80:04 - 80:11)
in pokey park wii pikachu's adventure (80:06 - 80:12)
see this is why they need to hire me (80:11 - 80:15)
this right here this is it (80:12 - 80:17)
in pokey park wii's pikachu adventure (80:15 - 80:18)
porygon z (80:17 - 80:21)
is referred to as a he even though poory (80:18 - 80:24)
got it and porygon is genderless (80:21 - 80:27)
the these are the details i'm there for (80:24 - 80:28)
we gotta make sure they say (80:27 - 80:32)
they not he yes absolutely (80:28 - 80:34)
this is a genderless pokemon there is no (80:32 - 80:36)
heart on its tail (80:34 - 80:39)
there's no there's no heart on its butt (80:36 - 80:40)
not that we know you know (80:39 - 80:43)
maybe in the future in addition to (80:40 - 80:45)
in addition despite never appearing in (80:43 - 80:48)
the anime outside of a brief cameo (80:45 - 80:50)
it did receive an anime voice in an (80:48 - 80:52)
aforementioned game (80:50 - 80:54)
like every other are they talking wait (80:52 - 80:55)
what trip oh (80:54 - 80:58)
wait what this is a sub point to pokey (80:55 - 80:59)
park (80:58 - 81:01)
yeah yeah i don't know that's like the (80:59 - 81:03)
most bizarre trivial trivia ever (81:01 - 81:07)
so in poke in poker park do they say (81:03 - 81:09)
like do they say their name like they do (81:07 - 81:10)
in the anime i don't remember (81:09 - 81:12)
oh they probably i think they do so (81:10 - 81:14)
that's what they're saying is since it (81:12 - 81:16)
was never in the anime where it spoke (81:14 - 81:20)
it does say i'm assuming porygon z (81:16 - 81:21)
porygon z (81:20 - 81:22)
in the game yeah i think that's what (81:21 - 81:26)
that actually says porygon zed (81:22 - 81:29)
um it should be cor porygon 2 2. (81:26 - 81:33)
since no leveling up is required porygon (81:29 - 81:35)
or porygon 2 or porygon z (81:33 - 81:39)
can all be evolved twice at level 1. (81:35 - 81:41)
oregon z is tied with drampa and mega (81:39 - 81:42)
pidgeot (81:41 - 81:45)
look at that timing wheel (81:42 - 81:45)
for the highest base special attack of (81:47 - 81:50)
all (81:50 - 81:53)
normal type pokemon oregon and its (81:50 - 81:54)
pre-evolutions are the only (81:53 - 81:56)
pokemon where all three members can (81:54 - 82:00)
learn both hyper beam and giga impact (81:56 - 82:03)
i like poor gunzi a lot probably one of (82:00 - 82:03)
the (82:03 - 82:05)
better things that came out of gen 4. (82:03 - 82:07)
what's funny is that it's considered to (82:05 - 82:08)
be a corruption (82:07 - 82:12)
when it's actually got better (82:08 - 82:15)
art than the original porygon 2 i don't (82:12 - 82:16)
know oh well i guess (82:15 - 82:18)
maybe because it's like rayman and the (82:16 - 82:21)
parts have all kind of come apart (82:18 - 82:24)
yeah it's clearly broken (82:21 - 82:27)
its eyes are all messed up googly (82:24 - 82:30)
although the shuffle icon is really good (82:27 - 82:31)
it's it's (82:30 - 82:35)
tail is down its arms are up it's (82:31 - 82:37)
it's having some issues but it's got a (82:35 - 82:38)
sweet sweet shiny (82:37 - 82:41)
and how is its uh shuffle icon sweet (82:38 - 82:42)
it's really good (82:41 - 82:44)
you get get that real get that real (82:42 - 82:46)
googly eye let me also (82:44 - 82:49)
express uh additional disappointment in (82:46 - 82:50)
our slack community (82:49 - 82:52)
because one day last week they were (82:50 - 82:55)
literally talking about porygon (82:52 - 82:58)
in the general channel and i put in the (82:55 - 82:59)
statement (82:58 - 83:02)
boy you guys shouldn't this conversation (82:59 - 83:04)
be in pokemon of the week (83:02 - 83:06)
and then like five of them moved over to (83:04 - 83:07)
pokemon of the week and started (83:06 - 83:08)
questioning what could the pokemon of (83:07 - 83:11)
the week be and i was like did you not (83:08 - 83:12)
notice that you were all just talking (83:11 - 83:15)
about porygon (83:12 - 83:18)
wow pay attention you got to be quick (83:15 - 83:22)
around will anderson but not that quick (83:18 - 83:24)
i have high expectations dude i think (83:22 - 83:26)
the slack (83:24 - 83:28)
community was more focused when they (83:26 - 83:30)
were all actually at their jobs (83:28 - 83:34)
avoiding work exactly oh yeah for now (83:30 - 83:36)
that they're at home (83:34 - 83:40)
we feel like the work (83:36 - 83:41)
and they're looking for other (83:40 - 83:43)
distractions (83:41 - 83:43)
well let me give you this week's (83:44 - 83:47)
distraction uh (83:45 - 83:50)
obviously since porygon z was (83:47 - 83:53)
far too hard for everyone uh (83:50 - 83:57)
we're going extra simple this week (83:53 - 84:00)
shut up now we've already done chat out (83:57 - 84:01)
this year (84:00 - 84:03)
while last week's pokemon of the week (84:01 - 84:06)
could be identified by just one letter (84:03 - 84:08)
this week's psychic type pokemon is (84:06 - 84:10)
represented by every latter (84:08 - 84:12)
letter of the latin alphabet including (84:10 - 84:14)
some punctuation (84:12 - 84:16)
you will also note that the gallerian (84:14 - 84:18)
alphabet does not use (84:16 - 84:21)
transcriptions of these pokemon as this (84:18 - 84:23)
pokemon has not yet (84:21 - 84:26)
been found in galler while this pokemon (84:23 - 84:28)
is not particularly popular in the (84:26 - 84:30)
traditional pokemon cartridge games (84:28 - 84:34)
it is quite sought after in pokemon go (84:30 - 84:35)
it has only been released and in (84:34 - 84:37)
restricted quantities (84:35 - 84:40)
to correspond with special events (84:37 - 84:43)
i mean come on now no clue oh yeah (84:40 - 84:46)
