what's up everyone welcome to the (0:22 - 0:28)
566 episode of the Pokemon podcast it's (0:25 - 0:31)
super effective I'm your host Steve with (0:28 - 0:33)
me is Greg have I told you all that I (0:31 - 0:36)
live in a mad scientist's house now (0:33 - 0:39)
have we had this discussion (0:36 - 0:40)
I know your husband (0:39 - 0:44)
so my husband bought this new air (0:40 - 0:46)
purifier which is technically an air (0:44 - 0:49)
purifier it is an algae container (0:46 - 0:52)
so it's a giant tube that grows algae (0:49 - 0:54)
because algae is great at purifying the (0:52 - 0:55)
air (0:54 - 0:58)
two issues with it it has to be running (0:55 - 1:00)
at all times (0:58 - 1:03)
which includes making bubbles and it has (1:00 - 1:06)
to have a light on so on his desk at all (1:03 - 1:08)
times in my living room is this weird (1:06 - 1:11)
green tube that bubbles at me and I live (1:08 - 1:14)
in a mad scientist set he actually said (1:11 - 1:15)
to me he's like I'm trying to find one (1:14 - 1:18)
of those uh old props that has the (1:15 - 1:21)
lightning going up between two rods to (1:18 - 1:23)
put over in the side corner I'm like I (1:21 - 1:25)
don't mind leaning into the mad (1:23 - 1:27)
scientist thing but can we finish other (1:25 - 1:31)
parts of the house before we go way off (1:27 - 1:33)
the deep end (1:31 - 1:36)
which is incredible yeah I mean this is (1:33 - 1:39)
my life (1:36 - 1:42)
Hannah also here (1:39 - 1:44)
nothing as exciting as that a few (1:42 - 1:46)
episodes or a couple episodes ago people (1:44 - 1:48)
asked for more cat updates my cat update (1:46 - 1:49)
is that my cat has been consistently (1:48 - 1:53)
waking me up at 4am yeah good kitty (1:49 - 1:57)
way to do it the worst hour (1:53 - 1:57)
uh hey they sell uh gay cat toys at (1:57 - 2:03)
Target now and I bought Archer one and (2:01 - 2:05)
he is upset it's a little fish that has (2:03 - 2:06)
a rainbow on it and he's obsessed with (2:05 - 2:09)
it I'm the best five dollars I've spent (2:06 - 2:10)
all week (2:09 - 2:13)
uh (2:10 - 2:16)
uh good kitty (2:13 - 2:16)
we're proud that we are hosting the (2:17 - 2:22)
coming out party for your cat your life (2:20 - 2:25)
on the podcast finally finally it's been (2:22 - 2:28)
many many years coming we didn't want to (2:25 - 2:30)
force the issue but we're glad we're (2:28 - 2:31)
finally here (2:30 - 2:34)
in time for (2:31 - 2:34)
tennis shoes (2:35 - 2:38)
uh there was a lot of issues this week (2:36 - 2:40)
in the Pokemon (2:38 - 2:44)
I think this is the only time maybe in (2:40 - 2:46)
history when every (2:44 - 2:50)
fandom of a section of Pokemon is mad (2:46 - 2:54)
except for maybe Pokemon Masters I have (2:50 - 2:57)
not seen a Pokemon Masters Dev Heroes (2:54 - 3:00)
post on Twitter but I've seen it for (2:57 - 3:02)
everything else (3:00 - 3:06)
Pokemon unite is like four months mad at (3:02 - 3:08)
this point oh my (3:06 - 3:11)
Goshen yeah that doesn't hold a candle (3:08 - 3:12)
to Pokemon go (3:11 - 3:16)
that's true yeah I mean go go die hards (3:12 - 3:19)
or go die hards right I think they are (3:16 - 3:20)
the Professionals in the outrage machine (3:19 - 3:23)
everybody else are just amateurs they (3:20 - 3:25)
have moments of not being mad though so (3:23 - 3:27)
like tomorrow for well actually (3:25 - 3:31)
yesterday because we recorded this um (3:27 - 3:33)
Saturday there's always like Community (3:31 - 3:35)
Day yeah Community Day they're like (3:33 - 3:37)
happy for like three hours I think it's (3:35 - 3:39)
no more than three hours there's another (3:37 - 3:41)
great complaint that it should have been (3:39 - 3:43)
six hours yeah once it ends you have to (3:41 - 3:46)
be reminded that it's too short you uh (3:43 - 3:48)
you know you get a shiny object in front (3:46 - 3:50)
of people's eyes like babies and they (3:48 - 3:53)
get quiet for a while and then (3:50 - 3:56)
give them your keys and then they'll go (3:53 - 3:57)
back to crying because they're probably (3:56 - 3:59)
hungry or something me too (3:57 - 4:04)
uh so uh the first issue I guess or the (3:59 - 4:08)
first news the first news article is (4:04 - 4:11)
accurate (4:08 - 4:14)
okay so uh this week or this past week (4:11 - 4:17)
was supposed to be the chestnot repeat (4:14 - 4:20)
week but there was also a brand new Raid (4:17 - 4:21)
event (4:20 - 4:24)
which was uh featuring iron tusks or (4:21 - 4:27)
iron treads in great Tusk I mean Iron (4:24 - 4:28)
test would probably be real cool if that (4:27 - 4:31)
was the thing so (4:28 - 4:33)
this is cool because it's our second (4:31 - 4:36)
Paradox event but (4:33 - 4:39)
um unlike iron leaves and walking wake (4:36 - 4:41)
uh these would have been you could catch (4:39 - 4:43)
as many as you want and the like real (4:41 - 4:46)
appeal here if anything (4:43 - 4:49)
is you can finally get the other one (4:46 - 4:51)
that you were missing in your game with (4:49 - 4:53)
your own OT (4:51 - 4:55)
obviously you could have traded for (4:53 - 4:56)
these (4:55 - 4:59)
you can't breed for them you could go (4:56 - 5:02)
into a person's game in the area area (4:59 - 5:04)
zero and do the nightmare scenario (5:02 - 5:05)
trying to figure where everybody is (5:04 - 5:07)
because he can't see each other and he (5:05 - 5:08)
catches them yourself which is what I (5:07 - 5:12)
did that's true the like you could play (5:08 - 5:16)
co-op for but for whatever reason (5:12 - 5:16)
you can't see each other but the person (5:16 - 5:22)
as a ghost can still spawn (5:19 - 5:24)
I don't know if that's supposed to be (5:22 - 5:26)
attention I don't know that that's (5:24 - 5:28)
supposed to happen I still don't know if (5:26 - 5:30)
that is supposed to be how that works (5:28 - 5:33)
but it is how it works and so we're just (5:30 - 5:35)
gonna go with it and pretend that that (5:33 - 5:38)
was the plan all along well it's weird (5:35 - 5:40)
that like if they didn't want you to do (5:38 - 5:43)
co-op in area zero why wouldn't they (5:40 - 5:46)
just be like hey this is off limits yeah (5:43 - 5:48)
they let you the co-op is pretty solid (5:46 - 5:50)
and area zero is one of the best parts (5:48 - 5:54)
of the game so you think yeah (5:50 - 5:57)
just weird that like (5:54 - 6:00)
you're invisible whereas like for if you (5:57 - 6:01)
haven't done (6:00 - 6:04)
if you haven't done co-op in scarlet and (6:01 - 6:06)
violet you can't see the other person (6:04 - 6:09)
the entire Co-op experience except for (6:06 - 6:11)
area zero where it is a hundred percent (6:09 - 6:14)
the other person is invisible no matter (6:11 - 6:15)
what (6:14 - 6:18)
they're just they're there (6:15 - 6:19)
yep (6:18 - 6:22)
and and the thing is is you can trick (6:19 - 6:24)
the game into making the other person (6:22 - 6:27)
appear (6:24 - 6:27)
which is my favorite part of that whole (6:27 - 6:33)
thing okay the era zero being invisible (6:31 - 6:36)
is not the issue although it is it is (6:33 - 6:38)
its own issue I suppose (6:36 - 6:41)
it's not the issue that everybody's (6:38 - 6:43)
having right now because they yanked the (6:41 - 6:45)
raids (6:43 - 6:47)
yes so uh the raids came out I did my (6:45 - 6:50)
Instagram post of like here are their (6:47 - 6:52)
movesets they actually the iron Treads (6:50 - 6:54)
and great Tusk I actually have really (6:52 - 6:56)
good move sets they have really good (6:54 - 6:57)
coverage (6:56 - 6:59)
um they're level seven they were level (6:57 - 7:02)
75. The Loot drop table was nothing (6:59 - 7:04)
impressive again I think the main appeal (7:02 - 7:05)
here is you know for people who don't (7:04 - 7:07)
have friends or can't do the invisible (7:05 - 7:09)
follow me thing so you know you connect (7:07 - 7:12)
to the Pokey portal you see the opposite (7:09 - 7:14)
one you join it you suffer through (7:12 - 7:16)
hopefully five minutes of people (7:14 - 7:18)
bringing the worst counter in the entire (7:16 - 7:19)
world and then you catch it and then (7:18 - 7:21)
you're like I got the other one cool (7:19 - 7:23)
um (7:21 - 7:25)
so (7:23 - 7:27)
literally (7:25 - 7:31)
within the first 10 minutes of uh these (7:27 - 7:33)
raids coming out uh (7:31 - 7:37)
Mr Joe serebi tweeted oh it's causing (7:33 - 7:40)
games to crash yep The Loot drop table (7:37 - 7:42)
may not have been impressive but it was (7:40 - 7:43)
the issue (7:42 - 7:47)
yeah and then about uh I think four hour (7:43 - 7:50)
well about two hours later it seemed (7:47 - 7:52)
like they were completely gone no one (7:50 - 7:54)
could even find the raids anymore and (7:52 - 7:55)
then about four hours later a tweet went (7:54 - 7:58)
out saying uh we have identified an (7:55 - 8:00)
issue that could result in an error (7:58 - 8:03)
after facing five-star great Tusk in (8:00 - 8:05)
Iron Treads raids in Pokemon scarlet and (8:03 - 8:08)
violet these raids will be suspended (8:05 - 8:10)
including chestnut with the mightiest (8:08 - 8:16)
Mark nah Chestnut hey I still needed one (8:10 - 8:16)
I need that to come back okay I'll come (8:17 - 8:22)
back yeah it'll come back I'm sure (8:19 - 8:25)
uh they say please check Pokey portal (8:22 - 8:26)
news (8:25 - 8:28)
uh you should see the effective raids we (8:26 - 8:31)
at if you see the effective raids we ask (8:28 - 8:34)
players not to participate we apologize (8:31 - 8:36)
um please note the five-star great Tusk (8:34 - 8:39)
and iron Treads as well as chestnut with (8:36 - 8:40)
the mighty spark will be canceled until (8:39 - 8:43)
further notice we will provide an update (8:40 - 8:45)
at a later date for future plans (8:43 - 8:48)
surrounding this event (8:45 - 8:51)
so the issue here surprisingly this (8:48 - 8:55)
issue happened in sword and shield (8:51 - 8:56)
so they did copy and paste this for (8:55 - 8:59)
whatever reason (8:56 - 9:01)
it's not really copy and paste it's just (8:59 - 9:04)
um raids what Hannah said earlier rates (9:01 - 9:06)
have a Loot drop table (9:04 - 9:09)
and so when the I can't remember what (9:06 - 9:11)
right it was in sword and shield but (9:09 - 9:14)
when the DLC came out in the Isle of (9:11 - 9:16)
armor there was a raid and a Pokemon in (9:14 - 9:18)
the raid was dropping one item that was (9:16 - 9:21)
exclusive to the crown Tundra but the (9:18 - 9:24)
crown Tundra wasn't out yet (9:21 - 9:26)
um so the item while it was in the game (9:24 - 9:28)
for (9:26 - 9:29)
the sake of being in the game it wasn't (9:28 - 9:31)
in the (9:29 - 9:33)
players game yet it wasn't like (9:31 - 9:36)
officially released so you would do the (9:33 - 9:37)
raid and then it would try to drop the (9:36 - 9:39)
eye I think it was like (9:37 - 9:42)
dynite ore wasn't it or something it was (9:39 - 9:44)
it was whatever the ore currency was (9:42 - 9:47)
supposed to be armorite ore no I'm right (9:44 - 9:49)
or was in Isle of armor so it was (9:47 - 9:51)
dinoidor (9:49 - 9:54)
so it was trying to drop dynite ore but (9:51 - 9:56)
Chron Thunder wasn't out yet so the game (9:54 - 9:58)
would be like oh this item's on the game (9:56 - 9:59)
currently and then your game would crash (9:58 - 10:02)
this is exactly what happened (9:59 - 10:04)
here with (10:02 - 10:07)
I think great tusk was trying to drop (10:04 - 10:08)
something (10:07 - 10:11)
we're trying to I I thought it was both (10:08 - 10:13)
of them that both of them were trying to (10:11 - 10:16)
drop the uh materials that you would get (10:13 - 10:18)
from when you defeat or catch any other (10:16 - 10:20)
Pokemon that's normally in the Pokedex (10:18 - 10:21)
the problem and the difference is that (10:20 - 10:25)
the Paradox Pokemon don't drop materials (10:21 - 10:27)
so the issue here was that even though (10:25 - 10:28)
these are Paradox Pokemon and we've (10:27 - 10:30)
caught Paradox Pokemon before these ones (10:28 - 10:32)
are in the Pokedex so the game was (10:30 - 10:35)
trying to get materials from them but (10:32 - 10:38)
those materials don't exist (10:35 - 10:42)
that you would get none times two (10:38 - 10:42)
I (10:43 - 10:46)
yeah if you do the like let's go feature (10:44 - 10:48)
in area zero (10:46 - 10:50)
you just you just get nothing for (10:48 - 10:52)
packing out (10:50 - 10:54)
like five iron hands you get the (10:52 - 10:55)
satisfaction of knocking out five iron (10:54 - 10:57)
oh yeah you do (10:55 - 11:00)
but you don't get any materials for (10:57 - 11:02)
knocking out five iron hands (11:00 - 11:05)
um so as far as we know there was no (11:02 - 11:07)
data loss there was no corruption there (11:05 - 11:09)
was no (11:07 - 11:12)
Vivion 2.0 it was just your Game just (11:09 - 11:15)
crashed as because as far as we know as (11:12 - 11:17)
far as we know yes I can't wait for the (11:15 - 11:18)
Reddit thread but don't worry Hannah (11:17 - 11:23)
will be on Pokemon crash watch we will (11:18 - 11:24)
be here (11:23 - 11:26)
if it's gonna corrupt someone's entire (11:24 - 11:28)
game then yes (11:26 - 11:30)
we will be here on (11:28 - 11:33)
corruption watch 2. as far as we know (11:30 - 11:34)
that doesn't exist (11:33 - 11:37)
um corruption 2.0 it doesn't exist till (11:34 - 11:38)
we make it (11:37 - 11:41)
and then Joe also said the reason they (11:38 - 11:42)
couldn't just pull (11:41 - 11:44)
the (11:42 - 11:46)
iron Treads and great Tusk is because (11:44 - 11:49)
all the raids are somehow related so (11:46 - 11:51)
they have to like pull them all at once (11:49 - 11:53)
if it was all automated or something (11:51 - 11:54)
that makes sense to me I was really (11:53 - 11:57)
hoping they wouldn't pull all three the (11:54 - 12:00)
chestnut is one that I needed (11:57 - 12:00)
they knew I took off (12:01 - 12:07)
they did I like get it well they're (12:04 - 12:09)
hoping that everybody is playing tears (12:07 - 12:12)
of the Kingdom (12:09 - 12:15)
the kingdom and is distracted this week (12:12 - 12:17)
then maybe the Pokemon news isn't (12:15 - 12:19)
generating as bad responses as the (12:17 - 12:22)
otherwise could be (12:19 - 12:24)
yeah I think (12:22 - 12:25)
so you have you have a repeat rate of (12:24 - 12:27)
Chestnut and then you have like (12:25 - 12:29)
a new event but like not the most (12:27 - 12:32)
exciting event it's not like I would say (12:29 - 12:33)
like Blissey was probably more exciting (12:32 - 12:34)
just because it was dropping materials (12:33 - 12:36)
that you would need (12:34 - 12:38)
I think for maybe (12:36 - 12:39)
if you don't have your Pokedex complete (12:38 - 12:41)
or you didn't do the invisible follow me (12:39 - 12:42)
thing (12:41 - 12:44)
I actually don't know how many people (12:42 - 12:45)
care about their own OT I care about my (12:44 - 12:48)
own OT because I'm like (12:45 - 12:51)
weirdly obsessed with (12:48 - 12:53)
OTS in general in Pokemon games but I (12:51 - 12:55)
don't know I'm sure some people are just (12:53 - 12:57)
like ah just give me it for the Pokedex (12:55 - 13:00)
entry yeah I mean I (12:57 - 13:02)
can't be bothered to look at the OC (13:00 - 13:05)
anymore yeah I don't care the only thing (13:02 - 13:06)
I care about is if it's in the right (13:05 - 13:07)
ball (13:06 - 13:10)
the things that I can see when I'm (13:07 - 13:11)
checking out my luxury ball if I'm (13:10 - 13:14)
checking out some other low rent cheap (13:11 - 13:18)
ball nah this is not my life I live the (13:14 - 13:20)
luxury life not this (13:18 - 13:23)
shenanigans that you all got going on a (13:20 - 13:25)
side note Greg are you gonna get the 100 (13:23 - 13:28)
luxury ball when it comes out yes uh uh (13:25 - 13:29)
we don't know when it's coming out just (13:28 - 13:31)
this year this year the I already told (13:29 - 13:33)
why do you think I was beating up prom (13:31 - 13:37)
kids at a punch pizza oh yeah yeah (13:33 - 13:39)
yeah I remember I didn't mention that (13:37 - 13:40)
one of those prom kids was wearing her (13:39 - 13:42)
crown and so that was big money right (13:40 - 13:44)
there I need to get my versus seeker and (13:42 - 13:46)
keep battling that dude to make Bank (13:44 - 13:51)
true get on my amulet coin so that I (13:46 - 13:52)
steal more money from them I still don't (13:51 - 13:55)
understand how they am like going works (13:52 - 14:00)
I think you get 50 yeah yeah but how in (13:55 - 14:01)
real life (14:00 - 14:04)
do I just say look I've got the AMOLED (14:01 - 14:06)
coin you owe me more money than the (14:04 - 14:08)
established amount (14:06 - 14:09)
yeah (14:08 - 14:11)
they're like are you like literally (14:09 - 14:14)
hypnotizing people look at the amulet (14:11 - 14:15)
coin and give me your wallet I'll take (14:14 - 14:19)
what I feel is appropriate (14:15 - 14:19)
um (14:19 - 14:23)
I think the biggest question I have is (14:21 - 14:25)
if they (14:23 - 14:28)
I I don't know it feels like it's very (14:25 - 14:29)
clear to me they've had a schedule for (14:28 - 14:32)
the last couple months of like we're (14:29 - 14:35)
gonna do this and then in two weeks (14:32 - 14:36)
we're gonna do this and then two weeks (14:35 - 14:39)
we're gonna do this and then so (14:36 - 14:41)
if they're rescheduling it which is cool (14:39 - 14:43)
and they should (14:41 - 14:44)
um (14:43 - 14:46)
and you know like this upcoming weekend (14:44 - 14:48)
we were supposed to get (14:46 - 14:50)
Delphox and then in two weeks we're (14:48 - 14:51)
supposed to get rela boom (14:50 - 14:53)
is (14:51 - 14:57)
are they gonna like squeeze this in are (14:53 - 14:59)
they gonna wait until we get the last (14:57 - 15:01)
two starters and then or like run the (14:59 - 15:03)
repeat but then was there supposed to be (15:01 - 15:06)
something after that (15:03 - 15:09)
well I wonder how deep the problem goes (15:06 - 15:11)
because can they I mean they're having (15:09 - 15:12)
to like (15:11 - 15:15)
if this is affecting all raids and it's (15:12 - 15:16)
something they didn't realize was going (15:15 - 15:18)
to happen and is now affecting future (15:16 - 15:20)
rates does that push the entire schedule (15:18 - 15:23)
back like since we don't really know (15:20 - 15:26)
what the bug was caused by on their side (15:23 - 15:29)
it's hard to say like is it just an easy (15:26 - 15:31)
fix and will we better be back on the (15:29 - 15:33)
regular raid schedule or did they (15:31 - 15:36)
uncover a much deeper problem relating (15:33 - 15:39)
to the DLCs that they now have to delay (15:36 - 15:40)
everything (15:39 - 15:43)
I mean like is it as easy as just don't (15:40 - 15:45)
tell the Pokemon to drop an item they (15:43 - 15:47)
don't have right is it that easy or or (15:45 - 15:50)
is this like a DLC prep where it's like (15:47 - 15:51)
oh (15:50 - 15:54)
in other areas they are going to start (15:51 - 15:56)
dropping things and that code went into (15:54 - 15:57)
early (15:56 - 15:59)
and it's now causing problems and it (15:57 - 16:01)
will be a problem for raids going (15:59 - 16:03)
forward like it's hard to say because so (16:01 - 16:05)
many of those changes happen on their (16:03 - 16:08)
side and since we're interacting with (16:05 - 16:11)
their servers we don't really know 100 (16:08 - 16:14)
what happened you you would think that (16:11 - 16:17)
look I'm not a coder I don't I'm sure I (16:14 - 16:18)
know you're not a coder you just have a (16:17 - 16:23)
pretty face I'm sure Pokemon games are (16:18 - 16:25)
held together with like rubber bands and (16:23 - 16:28)
Band-Aids I I worked on I used to work (16:25 - 16:29)
on websites and I remember when I (16:28 - 16:31)
started my new job and they were like (16:29 - 16:33)
okay uh the website's gonna need a lot (16:31 - 16:35)
of work and when I look on the back end (16:33 - 16:38)
of the website I was like oh oh I delete (16:35 - 16:40)
this (16:38 - 16:44)
don't look that's what the sadness (16:40 - 16:47)
I was like oh this when you said it was (16:44 - 16:48)
going to be a lot of work (16:47 - 16:52)
you didn't mean like this entire website (16:48 - 16:56)
is is balanced on one toothpick (16:52 - 16:59)
that's how it goes you would think that (16:56 - 17:01)
they could just like (16:59 - 17:03)
turn off the raids remove the item from (17:01 - 17:05)
the loot pool and then turn the raids (17:03 - 17:08)
back on (17:05 - 17:08)
it was just automated yeah and they (17:08 - 17:15)
weren't able to change up work schedules (17:13 - 17:18)
in time to just do that last minute it (17:15 - 17:20)
does seem like we know what the issue is (17:18 - 17:22)
it does seem like it was limited to the (17:20 - 17:23)
fact that these were Paradox Pokemon (17:22 - 17:26)
that are in the Pokedex and I don't (17:23 - 17:28)
think that the issue would happen with (17:26 - 17:30)
Pokemon coming in from home because (17:28 - 17:33)
those aren't going to be in the Pokedex (17:30 - 17:35)
but it does seem to throw off their (17:33 - 17:36)
timetable at the very least (17:35 - 17:38)
[Music] (17:36 - 17:40)
see they should take the Niantic (17:38 - 17:42)
approach and roll these raids out by (17:40 - 17:46)
region so that New Zealand we just hear (17:42 - 17:48)
from New Zealand and we'd be like well (17:46 - 17:50)
nobody cares about you New Zealand why (17:48 - 17:52)
are you even talking to us (17:50 - 17:54)
they they get the betas for everything (17:52 - 17:57)
yeah whether they want it or not get (17:54 - 17:59)
wrecked New Zealand (17:57 - 18:02)
poor New Zealand (17:59 - 18:03)
uh (18:02 - 18:05)
so let's say you didn't care about (18:03 - 18:06)
Chestnut (18:05 - 18:08)
the majority of people possibly you (18:06 - 18:10)
didn't care about great Tusk or iron (18:08 - 18:12)
Treads but uh you cared about Pokemon (18:10 - 18:15)
home (18:12 - 18:17)
uh (18:15 - 18:17)
foreign (18:18 - 18:20)
so I think all the rumors (18:22 - 18:29)
which we didn't really talk about (18:27 - 18:31)
because I think the same rumors for (18:29 - 18:34)
Pokemon home were also (18:31 - 18:36)
which said May 19th that it was coming (18:34 - 18:37)
out (18:36 - 18:40)
which would have been on Friday also (18:37 - 18:42)
said that go Fest was supposed to be in (18:40 - 18:43)
like (18:42 - 18:47)
Tokyo which it's in Osaka so (18:43 - 18:50)
Get Wrecked so I was like I don't think (18:47 - 18:52)
that May 19th date is correct but that (18:50 - 18:53)
was what was going around of like May (18:52 - 18:57)
19th May 19th well on May 19th we got (18:53 - 18:59)
something well we got something very (18:57 - 19:01)
important and then some other minor (18:59 - 19:03)
things (19:01 - 19:03)
before that's true it was Greg's (19:03 - 19:07)
birthday before May 19th they announced (19:05 - 19:10)
on May 18th the connection between (19:07 - 19:12)
Pokemon home scarlet and violet and (19:10 - 19:15)
violet scarlet and Pokemon Violet is (19:12 - 19:16)
coming soon double Violet there that's (19:15 - 19:19)
the that's the secret pilot secret (19:16 - 19:21)
violet (19:19 - 19:23)
Pokemon home will soon be updated to 3.0 (19:21 - 19:25)
see player people are asking the wrong (19:23 - 19:28)
question here I will get I will get you (19:25 - 19:30)
the right question in a second and (19:28 - 19:31)
players will be able to link Pokemon (19:30 - 19:33)
home to scarlet and violet linking (19:31 - 19:35)
scarlet and violet to home will allow (19:33 - 19:36)
players to move Pokemon freely between (19:35 - 19:39)
home and their game just remember that a (19:36 - 19:41)
Pokemon can be moved to games they only (19:39 - 19:42)
can appear in (19:41 - 19:45)
for example dalive I this was their (19:42 - 19:48)
example out of all of 1 000 whatever (19:45 - 19:51)
Pokemon they chose dollop doll of his (19:48 - 19:53)
cute when I first read that I was like (19:51 - 19:55)
wait what's a DOT oh I was like oh yeah (19:53 - 19:58)
are you kidding me (19:55 - 20:00)
smile of dollop and Arbor Olive middle (19:58 - 20:02)
Evolutions get lost (20:00 - 20:06)
evolution is amazing it's so cute I (20:02 - 20:08)
don't know you think just use something (20:06 - 20:11)
that like lechonk I've like a Pokemon (20:08 - 20:14)
that they used chuck had the moment in (20:11 - 20:16)
the sun literally everywhere and nobody (20:14 - 20:17)
cares about a chunk anywhere we had (20:16 - 20:21)
lechunk overload for example (20:17 - 20:23)
cannot be moved to Pokemon sword and (20:21 - 20:27)
shield or brilliant diamond or shining (20:23 - 20:29)
Pearl or Pokemon Legends you can't move (20:27 - 20:31)
Dolly to any (20:29 - 20:33)
because it doesn't matter appear in (20:31 - 20:36)
those games now you're thinking what (20:33 - 20:40)
about a Pikachu a Pikachu however their (20:36 - 20:42)
words not mine from Pokemon scarlet and (20:40 - 20:45)
violet can be moved to those games (20:42 - 20:48)
because it appears in it Additionally (20:45 - 20:51)
the terror type of the Pokemon moved (20:48 - 20:53)
from scarlet and violet will be (20:51 - 20:55)
determined by their original types (20:53 - 20:58)
so this is actually pretty big (20:55 - 20:59)
um this is the first time since (20:58 - 21:02)
generation two if I remember correctly (20:59 - 21:06)
that you could move a Pokemon to an (21:02 - 21:09)
older generation game (21:06 - 21:11)
so I could catch a Pikachu in Scarlet (21:09 - 21:13)
Violet and move it to sword and ship (21:11 - 21:15)
their example and move it to sword and (21:13 - 21:19)
shield and I believe in Joe in in gold (21:15 - 21:22)
and silver you could catch uh (21:19 - 21:25)
canopy sure you could catch a lot of gen (21:22 - 21:26)
put one Pokemon actually in gold and (21:25 - 21:27)
silver because that was the first part (21:26 - 21:29)
of that entire game all the Gen 2 (21:27 - 21:31)
Pokemon were in the later yeah but you (21:29 - 21:33)
could catch a Caterpie in gold and (21:31 - 21:35)
silver and move it back to Red and Blue (21:33 - 21:38)
and you could never do that ever in (21:35 - 21:40)
at all right like (21:38 - 21:42)
yeah yeah (21:40 - 21:44)
there was no between games that were in (21:42 - 21:47)
the same generation so remakes and (21:44 - 21:48)
things like that yeah you could move (21:47 - 21:50)
from like (21:48 - 21:53)
Omega Ruby to X and yep (21:50 - 21:55)
but not Sun and Moon (21:53 - 21:57)
to X and Y (21:55 - 21:59)
right (21:57 - 22:01)
so (21:59 - 22:03)
that's a that's a (22:01 - 22:06)
Big W that's great that is not something (22:03 - 22:09)
we're expecting I think (22:06 - 22:12)
uh I I think the the like slight bummer (22:09 - 22:15)
is I'm assuming if you have a Pikachu (22:12 - 22:18)
with uh like paldea ribbon and the (22:15 - 22:22)
cooking Mark and the humongo mark and (22:18 - 22:23)
you move it to sword and shield I'm (22:22 - 22:26)
assuming those ribbons just (22:23 - 22:28)
disappear (22:26 - 22:30)
a common theme in Pokemon games (22:28 - 22:32)
apparently now just like in area zero (22:30 - 22:35)
you disappear for a little bit you just (22:32 - 22:39)
blink out then when it comes back I'm (22:35 - 22:41)
assuming your your ribbons and marks (22:39 - 22:42)
come back (22:41 - 22:45)
one would hope they're keeping track of (22:42 - 22:47)
those like they are the moves (22:45 - 22:50)
holy cow this bowl is happening on this (22:47 - 22:54)
podcast right now bold bold statements (22:50 - 22:56)
this just reminded me of when you moved (22:54 - 23:00)
a Pokemon from (22:56 - 23:00)
scar sword and shield to bdsp (23:00 - 23:07)
yeah and even if all the moves on the (23:04 - 23:09)
Pokemon were legal (23:07 - 23:13)
bdsp were like nope nope the last four (23:09 - 23:14)
moves (23:13 - 23:16)
that's it (23:14 - 23:19)
I don't care that earthquake is legal he (23:16 - 23:21)
doesn't learn earthquake by leveling up (23:19 - 23:23)
yeah don't get earthquake and on top of (23:21 - 23:26)
that earthquake is a TM that is not (23:23 - 23:30)
unlimited that you can only buy from the (23:26 - 23:33)
uh battle tower so guess what your (23:30 - 23:35)
Garchomp that you moved from sword and (23:33 - 23:38)
shield doesn't have earthquake and there (23:35 - 23:40)
was only one TM for earthquake on the (23:38 - 23:43)
victory road you used it you gotta go (23:40 - 23:46)
buy it now (23:43 - 23:46)
terrible they're bad ESP are the (23:46 - 23:51)
greatest remakes that have ever been (23:50 - 23:55)
remade and I cannot sit here and listen (23:51 - 23:58)
to this slander I feel like you're doing (23:55 - 24:01)
this without laughing (23:58 - 24:01)
they're so frustrating and I bought both (24:03 - 24:09)
and I've never played the second one (24:05 - 24:11)
yeah I convinced people to get those (24:09 - 24:13)
games before they came out and then I (24:11 - 24:15)
very much regretted it yeah this is how (24:13 - 24:19)
we ruin our credibility right here (24:15 - 24:19)
gosh the whole like moving Pokemon to (24:20 - 24:24)
bdsp and I'm like (24:22 - 24:27)
forced losing all their moves even (24:24 - 24:28)
though they were is the most frustrating (24:27 - 24:30)
thing in the entire world (24:28 - 24:33)
holy cow I'm I I've I'm I've never been (24:30 - 24:35)
so mad but I'm just I'm furious right (24:33 - 24:38)
now look if you're gonna start feeding (24:35 - 24:42)
the fire ilka hashtag on Twitter that (24:38 - 24:44)
has popped up I am not I'm not going to (24:42 - 24:47)
be here for that but I do agree it was (24:44 - 24:50)
dumb if in this article they said the (24:47 - 24:52)
reason we delayed it was so we didn't (24:50 - 24:55)
have the move relearning issue in bdsp I (24:52 - 24:58)
would be like please take all the time (24:55 - 25:01)
you want whatever you need whatever how (24:58 - 25:04)
can we help how can we get to where (25:01 - 25:07)

up is that is that it no it's not the (25:57 - 26:03)
golden lure it's the the treasure chest (25:59 - 26:06)
oh they're all oh so I have a million of (26:03 - 26:08)
those yeah oh okay oh they're trapped in (26:06 - 26:09)
the Treasure I don't know why I didn't I (26:08 - 26:11)
I just thought I was like oh I should (26:09 - 26:12)
catching give me goals but no you're (26:11 - 26:15)
right they don't have the chest (26:12 - 26:15)
up their chest do you get to catch it (26:15 - 26:21)
dude for all no because it's like (26:19 - 26:24)
awesome why are they so stingy (26:21 - 26:24)
you know why I question this is because (26:24 - 26:29)
what community was it Greg where it was (26:27 - 26:32)
me and you and maybe maybe will was (26:29 - 26:33)
there I can't remember because will (26:32 - 26:36)
broke his foot at one point he broke he (26:33 - 26:39)
broke his yes he did break his foot (26:36 - 26:41)
but that was the one that I couldn't (26:39 - 26:42)
make it to where he I mean he had broken (26:41 - 26:44)
his foot before him was still walking (26:42 - 26:45)
yeah (26:44 - 26:47)
it was the three of us because I was (26:45 - 26:50)
like because Community ended and there (26:47 - 26:51)
was like two Golden Lures and you were (26:50 - 26:54)
ready to go home and I was like oh let's (26:51 - 26:56)
go get these Golden Lures this is my (26:54 - 26:58)
whole plan on Community Day is to keep (26:56 - 27:00)
Greg as long as possible at Mall of (26:58 - 27:03)
America but anyways so we go over to (27:00 - 27:05)
those Golden Lures and this old lady (27:03 - 27:07)
comes up maybe she wasn't all cheap I (27:05 - 27:10)
remember this she looked older and she (27:07 - 27:12)
came up and she was like (27:10 - 27:14)
do you guys know what the Golden Lures (27:12 - 27:16)
do and I was like yeah yeah yeah yeah (27:14 - 27:20)
yeah yeah who do you think I am (27:16 - 27:23)
and then she said be on the lookout for (27:20 - 27:26)
the little coin guy too you can catch (27:23 - 27:28)
him and then she walked away and I was (27:26 - 27:29)
like (27:28 - 27:33)
oh yeah Roman gimme ghoul but I already (27:29 - 27:34)
caught a bunch off an incense so when (27:33 - 27:36)
she said that I was like what does it (27:34 - 27:39)
only spawn at Golden why did the lures (27:36 - 27:41)
might also I think they may also spawn (27:39 - 27:44)
Roman gimmiguel rarely so they may (27:41 - 27:46)
occasionally spawn it and that's where (27:44 - 27:49)
you can share the spawning with friends (27:46 - 27:52)
but if you aren't connecting yourself to (27:49 - 27:53)
a scarlet and violet and you aren't (27:52 - 27:55)
getting the treasure chest yourself then (27:53 - 27:56)
yeah the lures are a great way to do (27:55 - 27:58)
that but the treasure chest is the main (27:56 - 28:00)
way yeah she really questioned my (27:58 - 28:04)
judgment about Pokemon go (28:00 - 28:04)
like what are you talking about I mean (28:05 - 28:09)
she called everything into question that (28:07 - 28:13)
day lessons are learned things we were (28:09 - 28:15)
shocked was what was happening (28:13 - 28:18)
uh from version 3.0 onwards there will (28:15 - 28:20)
be a variety of features added to the (28:18 - 28:24)
Nintendo switch version of Pokemon home (28:20 - 28:25)
you will be able to exchange Pokemon (28:24 - 28:27)
home points you can receive based on the (28:25 - 28:29)
number of Pokemon you have in your home (28:27 - 28:32)
boxes L for LP leak points that you can (28:29 - 28:34)
use in Scarlet Violet this is awesome (28:32 - 28:36)
because I got Max I got nine nine I (28:34 - 28:38)
think it's five nines (28:36 - 28:42)
99 yeah I I've had Max for a long time (28:38 - 28:44)
the more Pokemon you move into home the (28:42 - 28:47)
more items you can buy in paldea cool (28:44 - 28:50)
you will be able to change the Pokemon (28:47 - 28:52)
Details page to display information (28:50 - 28:54)
based on the game the Pokemon has been (28:52 - 28:56)
in doing so will allow you to check the (28:54 - 28:58)
information about which Pokemon for (28:56 - 29:00)
whichever game you please you can use (28:58 - 29:01)
this feature while viewing your home (29:00 - 29:02)
boxes without being connected to your (29:01 - 29:04)
game (29:02 - 29:06)
when bringing a Pokemon from Pokemon (29:04 - 29:08)
home to a linked game you'll be able to (29:06 - 29:10)
change the moves (29:08 - 29:12)
it knows from a list of moves that it (29:10 - 29:14)
had learned up to this point (29:12 - 29:16)
these moves are limited to the moves (29:14 - 29:17)
that it can learn in sword and shield (29:16 - 29:20)
brilliant Diamond shining Pearl uh some (29:17 - 29:22)
moves are exclusive or Pokemon Legends (29:20 - 29:25)
Arceus this will allow you to have the (29:22 - 29:27)
Pokemon know the moves you want before (29:25 - 29:30)
moving it out of home (29:27 - 29:33)
so does that fix is that are they saying (29:30 - 29:35)
that fixes the brilliant Diamond shining (29:33 - 29:38)
pro issue yeah yeah yep I take it all (29:35 - 29:40)
back Pokemon is the Fantastic so we're (29:38 - 29:42)
back now this is why everybody was so (29:40 - 29:44)
excited when the this announcement (29:42 - 29:45)
happened (29:44 - 29:48)
until until the second announcement (29:45 - 29:51)
happened all dropped okay so I I okay so (29:48 - 29:53)
here's here's the real question no one's (29:51 - 29:55)
asking this is why I cannot be um okay (29:53 - 29:56)
I'm slightly excited about the movie (29:55 - 29:58)
learning stuff the real the the thing (29:56 - 30:02)
that we should be asking is can I see (29:58 - 30:04)
marks and ribbons in the switch version (30:02 - 30:06)
of the game (30:04 - 30:10)
because that is not like (30:06 - 30:13)
if I caught (30:10 - 30:13)
200 flittle from A flitel outbreak (30:13 - 30:18)
because I was looking for a big flittle (30:16 - 30:20)
or small flittle or flittle the Furious (30:18 - 30:24)
or flittle the the the hungry (30:20 - 30:26)
and then I'm like I need to mass release (30:24 - 30:29)
move it to home (30:26 - 30:32)
I can't check that I can't see the marks (30:29 - 30:34)
or I can see them in the mobile version (30:32 - 30:37)
of Home hmm (30:34 - 30:39)
but that's not (30:37 - 30:42)
helpful right because then I would be (30:39 - 30:43)
like oh I forgot to check for marks I (30:42 - 30:45)
got to move them back check for marks (30:43 - 30:46)
like (30:45 - 30:48)
well I mean you could put them in home (30:46 - 30:50)
close home on your switch open home on (30:48 - 30:53)
your mobile check for marks that sounds (30:50 - 30:55)
so cool (30:53 - 30:57)
can you Mass release on the mobile (30:55 - 31:02)
version yeah can you I think you can (30:57 - 31:02)
the fact that the mobile version and the (31:03 - 31:07)
switch version we have to ask these (31:05 - 31:09)
questions of like which ones can do what (31:07 - 31:13)
because there's the actual problem yep (31:09 - 31:16)
uh (31:13 - 31:16)
maybe part of the whole change the (31:16 - 31:21)
Pokemon Details page thing (31:18 - 31:24)
but it sounds unlikely (31:21 - 31:26)
this is exhausting (31:24 - 31:30)
well to make it even more exhausting (31:26 - 31:30)
they put the cart before the mudsdale (31:32 - 31:39)
clever clever very so they said that (31:35 - 31:42)
Pokemon home so they announced this on (31:39 - 31:43)
Thursday and they said it was going to (31:42 - 31:47)
come out on Tuesday the 23rd so everyone (31:43 - 31:51)
was excited and then on on the 19th Greg (31:47 - 31:53)
and Greg's birthday they dropped the (31:51 - 31:55)
hammer like everything happened on my (31:53 - 31:56)
birthday (31:55 - 31:58)
and this (31:56 - 32:00)
wait do you have do you have the Tweet (31:58 - 32:04)
answer of the cart before (32:00 - 32:04)
yeah (32:06 - 32:09)
part before the mud stale yeah they said (32:07 - 32:11)
we put the card before the mudsdale they (32:09 - 32:14)
absolutely said that (32:11 - 32:14)
find the Tweet right now but they didn't (32:14 - 32:20)
they just said like oh we announced the (32:17 - 32:22)
the release date too early and that (32:20 - 32:26)
wasn't the actual release date and then (32:22 - 32:29)
and then said it will be coming soon (32:26 - 32:32)
yeah (32:29 - 32:37)
the wild yeah oh yeah so apparently the (32:32 - 32:39)
Japanese Pokemon Twitter (32:37 - 32:42)
never had a release date it was pretty (32:39 - 32:44)
much everyone that they just said coming (32:42 - 32:47)
very soon on the Japanese Twitter they (32:44 - 32:50)
said coming very soon but how (32:47 - 32:53)
I don't I I hate when people are like (32:50 - 32:56)
which in turn is getting fired for (32:53 - 32:59)
making that tweet because like (32:56 - 33:02)
one I don't think an intern at the (32:59 - 33:04)
Pokemon company is in charge of a (33:02 - 33:05)
company's brand Twitter I think somebody (33:04 - 33:08)
like before well I don't actually know (33:05 - 33:10)
who curling is in charge I knew the old (33:08 - 33:12)
social media manager which gosh she left (33:10 - 33:15)
she left (33:12 - 33:18)
right before the pandemic I think she (33:15 - 33:20)
left she ended up moving to Google and (33:18 - 33:21)
then she worked on the Google stadia (33:20 - 33:24)
team now Google Stadium isn't a thing (33:21 - 33:26)
anymore so I think I think touch it (33:24 - 33:28)
myself is what we call that I still I I (33:26 - 33:29)
still follow her on Twitter so she (33:28 - 33:31)
worked for the Pokemon social media and (33:29 - 33:33)
then she moved to Google stadia and I (33:31 - 33:36)
think she's on the Google pixel team I (33:33 - 33:38)
think which well those days are probably (33:36 - 33:40)
numbered at that point any Google (33:38 - 33:42)
product is like oh you got like a year (33:40 - 33:45)
out of it time to shut it down that's (33:42 - 33:46)
the incentive that they have within (33:45 - 33:48)
their company (33:46 - 33:50)
um but yeah social media manager is a (33:48 - 33:51)
full job (33:50 - 33:54)
most likely not an intern I don't think (33:51 - 33:56)
somebody getting paid minimum wage is (33:54 - 33:58)
tweeting (33:56 - 34:00)
the date of Pokemon home it like it (33:58 - 34:03)
seemed like that when they worded that (34:00 - 34:05)
when you read the tweet it was like oh (34:03 - 34:07)
like this is the official date but then (34:05 - 34:09)
they were like (34:07 - 34:12)
the most confusing thing is just the the (34:09 - 34:14)
follow-up tweet of like that wasn't the (34:12 - 34:17)
actual date (34:14 - 34:19)
like what where did you get them from (34:17 - 34:22)
yeah what are those dates why did you (34:19 - 34:25)
tweet those dates now then why did out (34:22 - 34:27)
of all the days (34:25 - 34:30)
like I cannot believe somebody in (34:27 - 34:33)
Bellevue Washington was like it was also (34:30 - 34:37)
so oddly specific oh yeah I have the (34:33 - 34:39)
tweet I have the Tweet okay to the Tweet (34:37 - 34:42)
we put the cart before the mudsdale (34:39 - 34:44)
earlier we mistakenly posted that (34:42 - 34:47)
Pokemon home version 3.0.0 would launch (34:44 - 34:50)
on May 23rd slash 24th however the (34:47 - 34:52)
actual release date is yet to be (34:50 - 34:54)
announced (34:52 - 34:54)
so please continue to follow our Pages (34:55 - 35:01)
for more information (34:59 - 35:03)
but can we trust you because that's what (35:01 - 35:06)
we were doing and you gave us the wrong (35:03 - 35:08)
date (35:06 - 35:08)
it's (35:08 - 35:11)
what (35:12 - 35:14)
it's not even like (35:16 - 35:19)
personally I don't know about you two or (35:20 - 35:25)
the rest of the people listening to this (35:23 - 35:27)
podcast I I feel like if they would have (35:25 - 35:29)
said (35:27 - 35:32)
hey we discovered a small issue we're (35:29 - 35:35)
gonna need a little bit more time (35:32 - 35:38)
that would be way better or uh hey we (35:35 - 35:40)
discovered a small issue it's actually (35:38 - 35:43)
coming out on May 30th again that would (35:40 - 35:45)
be better to be like (35:43 - 35:49)
we said the wrong date yep mudsdale (35:45 - 35:50)
Jones (35:49 - 35:54)
saying they need more time is what led (35:50 - 35:58)
to this amazing Legend of Zelda game (35:54 - 35:58)
I don't know how they thread the needle (36:00 - 36:04)
at this point because literally (36:02 - 36:07)
everybody's mad at them so like (36:04 - 36:09)
as much as those of us who who are more (36:07 - 36:11)
accepting like oh I get it you found a (36:09 - 36:13)
bug and you want to fix it that also (36:11 - 36:16)
feels a million ships of they need to (36:13 - 36:18)
give up this they can't make a perfect (36:16 - 36:19)
game they can't make anything right they (36:18 - 36:22)
are always messing up like there's not a (36:19 - 36:23)
great (36:22 - 36:27)
thread to hit there other than (36:23 - 36:30)
honestly what they said we gave you the (36:27 - 36:32)
wrong date (36:30 - 36:32)
okay we're gonna get it out of we're (36:33 - 36:37)
gonna get it out soon like I don't know (36:35 - 36:39)
that I don't know that the amount of (36:37 - 36:42)
people that saying we found a bug would (36:39 - 36:45)
mollify would be equal to the amount of (36:42 - 36:47)
people that it would equally anger right (36:45 - 36:48)
like (36:47 - 36:50)
I don't know that there's a good I it (36:48 - 36:53)
still makes me confused like (36:50 - 36:56)
where did you get this date (36:53 - 36:58)
from (36:56 - 37:01)
like well usually when the Pokemon (36:58 - 37:02)
company or the Pokemon company (37:01 - 37:04)
International (37:02 - 37:06)
so technically two different companies (37:04 - 37:09)
when they say like (37:06 - 37:11)
something is coming soon it almost (37:09 - 37:15)
always comes within the week right like (37:11 - 37:17)
so they they did like the Japanese (37:15 - 37:20)
Twitter prepped like oh it's coming soon (37:17 - 37:22)
they didn't have an actual date so when (37:20 - 37:23)
you look at the American Twitter and (37:22 - 37:24)
they say like it's coming in five days (37:23 - 37:27)
like that makes a lot of sense yeah (37:24 - 37:29)
because I can't remember the last time (37:27 - 37:30)
they were like it's coming soon and then (37:29 - 37:33)
like well maybe people are are like the (37:30 - 37:35)
like early spring or whatever but like (37:33 - 37:37)
when they when they tweet (37:35 - 37:40)
or send out uh pokemon.com thing and say (37:37 - 37:42)
coming soon like it's always within like (37:40 - 37:44)
a week (37:42 - 37:47)
um of of that (37:44 - 37:51)
but again if they tweeted like (37:47 - 37:54)
hey uh we we need a little bit more time (37:51 - 37:56)
sorry we put the cart before the (37:54 - 37:58)
mudsdale uh we'll have an update next (37:56 - 37:59)
week (37:58 - 38:04)
I don't know for me it's like the that (37:59 - 38:07)
was the wrong we said the wrong date but (38:04 - 38:11)
why why did you say that yeah (38:07 - 38:14)
it's the biggest thing is where did you (38:11 - 38:16)
get that date from here's what's gonna (38:14 - 38:18)
be funny is what if it actually still (38:16 - 38:20)
releases on the 24th and they were just (38:18 - 38:21)
yelled at for putting out an actual date (38:20 - 38:26)
for it but it still shows up on the 24th (38:21 - 38:26)
um and for the record I don't think it's (38:27 - 38:31)
because like iron Treads and great tusks (38:28 - 38:34)
are broken like the the date re recall (38:31 - 38:35)
happened (38:34 - 38:37)
hours before a great desk and iron (38:35 - 38:41)
Treads like came into raids (38:37 - 38:41)
because that was like because I woke up (38:44 - 38:47)
to (38:45 - 38:49)
I don't know if that's the right order (38:47 - 38:51)
of events (38:49 - 38:51)
they no because because (38:52 - 38:58)
all Friday people are mad well yeah wait (38:56 - 39:00)
oh no you're right you're right because (38:58 - 39:03)
I woke up to the news saying that the (39:00 - 39:05)
raids were coming down and I thought oh (39:03 - 39:08)
that's fine yeah and then I realized (39:05 - 39:09)
that they took chest not down to and (39:08 - 39:11)
that was an unfortunate way to wake up (39:09 - 39:14)
yeah I'm thinking that iron Treads since (39:11 - 39:16)
I haven't streamed all week my dates are (39:14 - 39:19)
very often you're right I was thinking (39:16 - 39:21)
that all of this happened on Friday but (39:19 - 39:23)
no iron Treads and great tasks are on (39:21 - 39:24)
Thursday night (39:23 - 39:26)
and then (39:24 - 39:27)
the home announcement was Thursday (39:26 - 39:30)
morning and then the recall announcement (39:27 - 39:33)
was Friday morning (39:30 - 39:37)
something like that yes yeah (39:33 - 39:37)
yeah I (39:40 - 39:45)
you know people are like game freak just (39:42 - 39:47)
needs to take more time with things and (39:45 - 39:49)
then Pokemon home has been this like (39:47 - 39:52)
very long waited thing (39:49 - 39:55)
and who knows I don't you would think (39:52 - 39:58)
that it can't be that (39:55 - 40:00)
broken it already works with four other (39:58 - 40:01)
Pokemon games you would think by now (40:00 - 40:05)
they know how to do this but (40:01 - 40:05)
maybe you know Scarlet and violet is uh (40:05 - 40:10)
held together with hot glue and (40:08 - 40:14)
Band-Aids every Everything has Tech debt (40:10 - 40:15)
and clearly they're introducing new (40:14 - 40:18)
features to home in this which people (40:15 - 40:21)
are excited about yeah we just don't (40:18 - 40:23)
know when now (40:21 - 40:26)
I I would love I guess we'll never know (40:23 - 40:30)
but I would love to know if (40:26 - 40:34)
the the Gimme ghoul Vivion issue it (40:30 - 40:36)
which wasn't even specifically like (40:34 - 40:38)
related to those it was just I think it (40:36 - 40:41)
was the 1.2 issue (40:38 - 40:41)
I wonder if that (40:43 - 40:47)
delayed (40:46 - 40:50)
a lot of stuff because they had to spend (40:47 - 40:52)
time trying to pinpoint and narrow it (40:50 - 40:56)
down like I I do wonder if the hot mess (40:52 - 40:59)
that is Scarlet and violet is the reason (40:56 - 41:03)
they dragged their feet so long on (40:59 - 41:05)
home compatibility (41:03 - 41:06)
but (41:05 - 41:09)
gosh we waited like six months well why (41:06 - 41:11)
I said we waited six months for bdsp to (41:09 - 41:13)
connect to home but like let's not (41:11 - 41:17)
forget bdsp was also made by the same (41:13 - 41:18)
people (41:17 - 41:21)
well made by ilka but but also a hot (41:18 - 41:24)
mess as a Pokemon game like that game (41:21 - 41:25)
didn't (41:24 - 41:26)
as far as I know I have any game (41:25 - 41:28)
breaking bugs where you would lose (41:26 - 41:30)
everything but (41:28 - 41:32)
it wasn't (41:30 - 41:36)
a super stable release (41:32 - 41:38)
I don't know (41:36 - 41:41)
I personally have no problem waiting (41:38 - 41:42)
another (41:41 - 41:45)
two three weeks for Pokemon (41:42 - 41:46)
um still another month of spring left (41:45 - 41:49)
yeah I got a month of spring we still (41:46 - 41:52)
got a month to go baby (41:49 - 41:56)
in all in in all reality what (41:52 - 41:58)
when they announced Pokemon home was (41:56 - 42:01)
coming soon I was like oh shoot I gotta (41:58 - 42:03)
like clean out my home before I transfer (42:01 - 42:06)
another game to it so if anything it's (42:03 - 42:07)
kind of bought me a little bit more time (42:06 - 42:10)
because I should really clean out my (42:07 - 42:12)
current home before I dump more Pokemon (42:10 - 42:15)
into it but the home is for dumping (42:12 - 42:17)
things into why would you ever clean it (42:15 - 42:19)
out it's where it's like it is like the (42:17 - 42:22)
public storage of apps you just put them (42:19 - 42:24)
in there you bring things up for (42:22 - 42:27)
Christmas or Easter look here's my buddy (42:24 - 42:32)
I caught 17 years ago it's Tradition now (42:27 - 42:32)

okay no one reported on this there's not (43:35 - 43:42)
actually like a a DOTA Esports or a (43:38 - 43:45)
polygon or a kataku or no one reported (43:42 - 43:47)
on this which is wild to me because I (43:45 - 43:49)
feel like where's comicbook.com I know (43:47 - 43:51)
you you all listen to me doing it (43:49 - 43:54)
comicbook.com loves reporting on Pokemon (43:51 - 43:56)
news and where are you guys no one (43:54 - 44:00)
reported on this so I had to go to uh (43:56 - 44:03)
I had to go to world champion section (44:00 - 44:04)
Park (44:03 - 44:08)
2014 world champion (44:04 - 44:12)
because they're Korean (44:08 - 44:12)
not this (44:13 - 44:17)
what else did this is wild to me and the (44:15 - 44:19)
reason I say like no one reported on (44:17 - 44:22)
this is because like (44:19 - 44:25)
Pokemon news gets clicks it's why you (44:22 - 44:27)
see weird off-branded sites report on (44:25 - 44:28)
Pokemon news because I know it'll just (44:27 - 44:31)
get clicks and it's fine whatever I get (44:28 - 44:33)
it you gotta write the Articles they'll (44:31 - 44:36)
get the clicks this will get clicks (44:33 - 44:37)
there was (44:36 - 44:38)
so (44:37 - 44:42)
some context here when you do the Google (44:38 - 44:45)
the global challenge for your (44:42 - 44:48)
backpack your Pokeball backpack your (44:45 - 44:49)
great ball backpack your Ultra Ball (44:48 - 44:51)
backpack (44:49 - 44:53)
uh you put you you place in a ranking (44:51 - 44:56)
like for the Ultra Ball backpack I (44:53 - 44:59)
placed like 7 000 in the world or (44:56 - 45:00)
whatever (44:59 - 45:02)
and (45:00 - 45:04)
if you rank high enough as like an (45:02 - 45:06)
American you'll get Championship points (45:04 - 45:09)
that you can take towards (45:06 - 45:12)
trying to qualify for worlds not a lot (45:09 - 45:13)
of Championship points but you know a (45:12 - 45:14)
couple (45:13 - 45:18)
and but those global challenges are (45:14 - 45:22)
for Korean and Japanese players to help (45:18 - 45:24)
them qualify for worlds because they (45:22 - 45:28)
don't have like a a Portland Regional (45:24 - 45:30)
regionals or a Daytona Beach I don't (45:28 - 45:32)
think Daytona Beach had a regionals this (45:30 - 45:33)
is the second week I've used Daytona (45:32 - 45:34)
Beach I don't know why (45:33 - 45:36)
um (45:34 - 45:36)
now there are also other official (45:37 - 45:44)
Japanese and Korean tournaments so there (45:41 - 45:47)
was recently a Korean tournament through (45:44 - 45:49)
scarlet and violet (45:47 - 45:51)
that (45:49 - 45:54)
happened the so it was a Korean and (45:51 - 45:58)
Japanese online world's qualifier so you (45:54 - 46:00)
could only participate if you were a (45:58 - 46:03)
legal resident of Japan or Korea (46:00 - 46:06)
and that happened and I think it was (46:03 - 46:09)
best of one and you had to play 10 games (46:06 - 46:12)
in a row it wasn't like all weekend you (46:09 - 46:14)
had sat down you played 10 games and (46:12 - 46:17)
then that would determined if you would (46:14 - 46:20)
like qualify and they just decided to (46:17 - 46:22)
invalidate (46:20 - 46:25)
every Korean player who participated so (46:22 - 46:27)
if you went like 10-0 if you won 10 (46:25 - 46:30)
matches and zero losses (46:27 - 46:33)
off the Record you have to redo the (46:30 - 46:35)
entire thing (46:33 - 46:37)
and sejin tweeted about this because (46:35 - 46:39)
they qualified (46:37 - 46:42)
as they should they're a 2014 World (46:39 - 46:45)
Champion they're very good at this game (46:42 - 46:49)
they he qualified and then they were (46:45 - 46:54)
like nope you there was uh in game bug (46:49 - 46:54)
are very broken (46:59 - 47:04)
there was some in-game bug we don't know (47:02 - 47:06)
exactly what the bug was (47:04 - 47:09)
but it affected the online tournament (47:06 - 47:13)
for Korean and Japanese players (47:09 - 47:13)
Japan decided that some players who (47:14 - 47:19)
qualified (47:17 - 47:21)
are okay to continue on and other (47:19 - 47:23)
players (47:21 - 47:25)
so another world champion (47:23 - 47:29)
Ray Rizzo who won three worlds back to (47:25 - 47:31)
back (47:29 - 47:33)
lives in Japan I don't know if you guys (47:31 - 47:35)
know this he moved to Japan before (47:33 - 47:38)
pandemic he lives there as a resident (47:35 - 47:41)
he qualified participated in the (47:38 - 47:43)
Japanese (47:41 - 47:46)
online World qualifier (47:43 - 47:48)
and they told him you were no longer (47:46 - 47:51)
invited you have to redo it (47:48 - 47:54)
so I only got the dues from two players (47:51 - 47:56)
Ray Rizzo and sejin park I don't know (47:54 - 47:58)
the full details that's why I (47:56 - 48:02)
I'm God have ESPN on this yeah where's (47:58 - 48:04)
ESPN this is this is Turtle this is (48:02 - 48:06)
competitive yeah tournament competitive (48:04 - 48:07)
drama (48:06 - 48:09)
um (48:07 - 48:12)
I I think if you don't do competitive I (48:09 - 48:14)
guess the takeaway here is uh (48:12 - 48:17)
uh there was a bug surprise (48:14 - 48:19)
and when I say bug I'm not talking about (48:17 - 48:22)
like spite UPS (48:19 - 48:25)
I don't know what the plug is (48:22 - 48:30)
um but that's not good (48:25 - 48:30)
I mean one of the bugs that they fixed (48:31 - 48:37)
in the big 1.2 update had been affecting (48:34 - 48:39)
tournaments before that (48:37 - 48:41)
and I don't think that they disqualified (48:39 - 48:46)
players from anything after that bug (48:41 - 48:46)
um probably does depending on depend on (48:46 - 48:51)
the on how big the bug is what exactly (48:48 - 48:54)
the issue I wonder I wonder if this is (48:51 - 48:57)
the Sim a similar bug to scarlet and (48:54 - 48:59)
violet (48:57 - 49:02)
um it was I think Players cup two where (48:59 - 49:07)
if you disconnected in a pro in the sort (49:02 - 49:10)
of sword and shield sorry if you discon (49:07 - 49:12)
disconnect it in a certain way in a (49:10 - 49:15)
competitive match a ranked competitive (49:12 - 49:18)
match it would force your opponent to (49:15 - 49:20)
take the loss because it would (49:18 - 49:22)
say that they disconnected even though (49:20 - 49:24)
you were causing the disconnection and (49:22 - 49:28)
then you would get the win and (49:24 - 49:30)
the Pokemon company tweeted (49:28 - 49:34)
that that was an issue happening and if (49:30 - 49:36)
they checked your profile and you were (49:34 - 49:38)
doing it you would yet permanently (49:36 - 49:41)
banned from the latter but that doesn't (49:38 - 49:43)
mean that (49:41 - 49:46)
players didn't do that right especially (49:43 - 49:49)
if you were like oh I only need one more (49:46 - 49:51)
win I'll force my opponent to disconnect (49:49 - 49:53)
and I'll get my last win and then I'll (49:51 - 49:56)
be done for the weekend kind of thing (49:53 - 49:59)
I wonder if it was like oh we determined (49:56 - 50:01)
that players were disconnecting forcing (49:59 - 50:03)
the other player to get a game loss they (50:01 - 50:05)
were like that's pretty like if you're (50:03 - 50:07)
only limited 10 games and you do that (50:05 - 50:10)
two out of like that's like (50:07 - 50:13)
20 of your games that you're (50:10 - 50:14)
cheating you're cheating right like (50:13 - 50:17)
there's no other word for that (50:14 - 50:22)
but they didn't say what the bug was (50:17 - 50:22)
but I did find game eight talking about (50:22 - 50:30)
what the patch will address issues (50:27 - 50:32)
affecting the online tournaments (50:30 - 50:34)
uh they say players unable to see their (50:32 - 50:36)
rankings Players are matched with the (50:34 - 50:40)
same opponents multiple times in a row (50:36 - 50:40)
it feels like that second one would like (50:44 - 50:50)
affect your ratings if you are matched (50:49 - 50:53)
up against the same person who you (50:50 - 50:55)
already defeated and then you just (50:53 - 50:57)
defeated them defeated them defeated (50:55 - 50:58)
them defeated them (50:57 - 51:01)
that would alter your rankings right (50:58 - 51:03)
like (51:01 - 51:05)
you would be (51:03 - 51:08)
artificially inflated or deflated based (51:05 - 51:10)
off of a bad matchup that you kept (51:08 - 51:12)
getting forced into yeah if you're only (51:10 - 51:14)
playing 10 matches (51:12 - 51:16)
ideally that would be 10 unique people (51:14 - 51:20)
not like not life well I mean if you (51:16 - 51:21)
beat the dude and you got rematched with (51:20 - 51:23)
them you're probably feeling pretty good (51:21 - 51:24)
yeah (51:23 - 51:27)
dude and he got rematch with them that (51:24 - 51:29)
ain't a great feeling at all yeah and (51:27 - 51:30)
then it also mentions players are unable (51:29 - 51:33)
to exit out between battles players are (51:30 - 51:35)
unable to exit properly from the online (51:33 - 51:37)
competition between matches this means (51:35 - 51:39)
most players are unable to play the game (51:37 - 51:42)
without hard resetting their game (51:39 - 51:46)
so I I have a feeling like (51:42 - 51:46)
the feel the second one the second one (51:48 - 51:53)
is probably the one where they're like (51:51 - 51:57)
we're gonna have to redo this it's it's (51:53 - 51:59)
weird that (51:57 - 52:01)
this didn't happen for the global (51:59 - 52:03)
Challenge and this is just a smaller (52:01 - 52:06)
version of that (52:03 - 52:07)
I don't know (52:06 - 52:09)
again (52:07 - 52:11)
I feel like I feel like these are all (52:09 - 52:14)
this is my conspiracy I feel like the (52:11 - 52:18)
raid thing breaking this they're all (52:14 - 52:20)
connected they put something in they are (52:18 - 52:23)
building something and they had (52:20 - 52:25)
unexpected consequences and it is (52:23 - 52:28)
wreaking havoc across the system it's (52:25 - 52:30)
affected my pull rate this is from that (52:28 - 52:33)
guy stealing all those rare cards from (52:30 - 52:36)
that this is continued Fallout from the (52:33 - 52:38)
theft from two years ago is finally (52:36 - 52:40)
catching up with us I mean it created a (52:38 - 52:42)
wrinkle and we are in the aftershocks (52:40 - 52:45)
still to this day my Master's poles are (52:42 - 52:47)
garbage (52:45 - 52:50)
this is why Vivion can't be in any games (52:47 - 52:53)
it's Pokedex number 666. yeah Mark of (52:50 - 52:56)
the butterfly (52:53 - 52:56)
okay okay so (52:57 - 53:03)
I have figured out (52:59 - 53:05)
to I have figured out how Pokemon go is (53:03 - 53:08)
making all their money I've I've (53:05 - 53:10)
narrowed it down okay you you guys (53:08 - 53:13)
thought it was raid passes you thought (53:10 - 53:15)
it was buying pokeballs you thought it (53:13 - 53:19)
was selling your location data I can (53:15 - 53:21)
tell you you're all wrong I figured it (53:19 - 53:21)
out (53:21 - 53:24)
conspiracy theory here we go two weeks (53:21 - 53:28)
ago I was like there's a Korean corn dog (53:24 - 53:30)
place near the University of Minnesota I (53:28 - 53:33)
think Greg knows where this is yep and I (53:30 - 53:36)
want a Korean corn dog (53:33 - 53:39)
and I went downtown I had to do street (53:36 - 53:41)
parking fine I'll give you your two (53:39 - 53:45)
dollars City of Minneapolis and then as (53:41 - 53:46)
I was walking down it's a bit of a (53:45 - 53:50)
stretch for her yeah (53:46 - 53:50)
that area is Dinkytown thank you very (53:50 - 53:54)
much (53:54 - 53:57)
it feels like downtown on a Friday (53:54 - 53:59)
Saturday it's like well it's probably (53:57 - 54:00)
you there's a bunch of youths running (53:59 - 54:03)
around there it's gang Central if the (54:00 - 54:07)
gangs are fret people and Central yeah (54:03 - 54:09)
yeah that's the one area that serves the (54:07 - 54:11)
East Bank of the University of Minnesota (54:09 - 54:13)
this is my stomping grounds I'll have (54:11 - 54:16)
you know this is where I went to college (54:13 - 54:16)
so I parked (54:17 - 54:22)
and I I well I was walking over to the (54:19 - 54:24)
Korean corn dog place and on the way (54:22 - 54:29)
there I saw a Kung Fu tea shop (54:24 - 54:32)
which remember that we slightly talked (54:29 - 54:34)
about Kung Fu Tea's partnership with uh (54:32 - 54:38)
Pokemon go on this podcast and I have it (54:34 - 54:40)
right here it says uh beginning on May (54:38 - 54:43)

United States and Canada will be (54:43 - 54:47)
transformed into gyms and pokestops keep (54:45 - 54:49)
an eye out to celebrate trainers will be (54:47 - 54:51)
able to find limited themed cups (54:49 - 54:54)
featuring team Instinct team Mystic team (54:51 - 54:56)
Valor in June you know I didn't read the (54:54 - 54:58)
June part until now (54:56 - 55:00)
um get ready to show off your pride when (54:58 - 55:02)
you refill your Pokemon go together okay (55:00 - 55:06)
so I didn't know Greg that we in this (55:02 - 55:10)
city of Minneapolis had a Kung Fu tea I (55:06 - 55:11)
thought this was like in a West Coast (55:10 - 55:15)
California thing where Metropolitan (55:11 - 55:16)
yeah they're definitely not only West (55:15 - 55:18)
Coast they had them over in DC when I (55:16 - 55:20)
lived in DC (55:18 - 55:22)
I've never seen one of these stores in (55:20 - 55:25)
person so I'm like oh that would be (55:22 - 55:27)
great we can get a corn dog because the (55:25 - 55:29)
corn dog place is not like a sit-down (55:27 - 55:31)
place you like no I just walk in you get (55:29 - 55:33)
your corn dog and you promptly leave and (55:31 - 55:36)
you are out get out yeah please leave as (55:33 - 55:38)

so like there's a whole level of just (55:38 - 55:41)
get your food and get out yes please (55:39 - 55:43)
leave um so I was like cool I'll get a (55:41 - 55:45)
corn dog and then I'll go to the Kung Fu (55:43 - 55:47)
tea so when you spin the Kung Fu tea (55:45 - 55:49)
pokestop which was an official pokestop (55:47 - 55:51)
like the Starbucks if anyone remembers (55:49 - 55:52)
the Starbucks but I think the Starbucks (55:51 - 55:55)
polka stops still exist yeah they're not (55:52 - 55:56)
I don't know if they're sponsored (55:55 - 55:57)
anymore (55:56 - 56:00)
but when you spin it it pops up and says (55:57 - 56:03)
like you can get a dollar off your boba (56:00 - 56:04)

Pokemon go installed at least that's (56:12 - 56:17)
what I did back six years ago and then (56:14 - 56:18)
the Barista was very upset they had to (56:17 - 56:20)
make the Pokemon go exclusive Starbucks (56:18 - 56:23)

Powerful master ball is a special (60:47 - 60:51)
occasion think wisely on how you will (60:49 - 60:53)
use it uh and keep on a lookout for (60:51 - 60:56)
future opportunities in Pokemon go (60:53 - 60:59)
um and that was kind of it so yes so if (60:56 - 61:00)
you want the master ball open your game (60:59 - 61:02)

part of the research if you haven't (61:02 - 61:05)
otherwise (61:04 - 61:07)
who knows when this will be coming back (61:05 - 61:12)
I have never used a master ball in any (61:07 - 61:14)
of the games and I'm not about to start (61:12 - 61:18)
now master balls are a sign of weakness (61:14 - 61:21)
and you're a bad trainer but you could (61:18 - 61:23)
get a gallerian bird (61:21 - 61:26)
Esther and if it was meant to be (61:23 - 61:29)
the other balls will catch it there are (61:26 - 61:30)
people who have four or five gallerian (61:29 - 61:32)
birds at this point (61:30 - 61:35)
if you put in the work you don't need (61:32 - 61:39)
these crutches like master balls you (61:35 - 61:41)
know what I need in Pokemon go I need (61:39 - 61:44)
well what I need more self-control but (61:41 - 61:46)
number two I need it to when I pop a (61:44 - 61:48)
daily incense (61:46 - 61:51)
it like automatically tells people I'm (61:48 - 61:54)
like not playing the game because I feel (61:51 - 61:55)
like (61:54 - 61:58)
the second I pop daily incense it's like (61:55 - 62:01)
raid invite raid invite raid invite (61:58 - 62:02)
and it's like (62:01 - 62:04)
these These are pretty rare now like I (62:02 - 62:06)
don't get ready to invites that much (62:04 - 62:09)
maybe I need to join this tapufini you (62:06 - 62:11)
just need to go into the thing and turn (62:09 - 62:14)
yourself offline yeah I just I I'm like (62:11 - 62:16)
okay I'm gonna go for 15 minutes I'm (62:14 - 62:18)
distracted and then somebody texts me or (62:16 - 62:19)
something happens then all of a sudden (62:18 - 62:21)
I'm like oh I caught one Pokemon in 15 (62:19 - 62:23)
minutes (62:21 - 62:26)
never got the bird to show up (62:23 - 62:26)
whatever like the master ball coming is (62:33 - 62:38)
cool we don't know how many (62:35 - 62:40)
like how frequently are we getting (62:38 - 62:41)
master balls are we getting it like one (62:40 - 62:43)
a season can we hold more than one did (62:41 - 62:45)
they say that are we going to the shop (62:43 - 62:47)
and buying a master ball for 10 bucks (62:45 - 62:49)
like What's Happening Here did they did (62:47 - 62:51)
not say if you can hold more than one so (62:49 - 62:53)
we have no idea my assume my assumption (62:51 - 62:57)
would be no just because that's a trend (62:53 - 62:59)
holding one thing at a time in Pokemon (62:57 - 63:02)
go yeah yeah (62:59 - 63:02)
we don't know when they'll be coming (63:02 - 63:06)
back so log in this week if you want one (63:03 - 63:11)
it's gonna be there and people are gonna (63:06 - 63:13)
either use it immediately or probably (63:11 - 63:16)
never use it honestly (63:13 - 63:16)
yeah I I I feel like the thing you would (63:16 - 63:22)
use it on is the gallerian bird I feel (63:20 - 63:24)
like the things you would use it on (63:22 - 63:26)
would either be a gallerian bird if you (63:24 - 63:28)
want one and you might at that point (63:26 - 63:30)
have the luxury to try and find a good (63:28 - 63:31)
one (63:30 - 63:35)
or just a very high IV legendary that (63:31 - 63:36)
you otherwise would have a hard time (63:35 - 63:39)
catching oh sure like a perfect IV (63:36 - 63:41)
non-shiny Kyogre yeah (63:39 - 63:43)
did I did I tell this story on the (63:41 - 63:46)
podcast where (63:43 - 63:48)
I this was the community you missed Greg (63:46 - 63:50)
I got to Mall of America (63:48 - 63:53)
will was there with his broken foot yep (63:50 - 63:55)
I was the one that broke it by the way (63:53 - 63:56)
for podcasts that's why will doesn't it (63:55 - 63:58)
was on the show I broke his foot and (63:56 - 64:00)
then he quit the problem I cannot (63:58 - 64:02)
believe we're bringing up this drama now (64:00 - 64:05)
at the seventh hour I mean when you took (64:02 - 64:07)
the sledgehammer and said hold still I'm (64:05 - 64:11)
gonna correct your foot problems I I was (64:07 - 64:13)
against it but you are like yeah this (64:11 - 64:15)
would be fine and then here we are today (64:13 - 64:17)
I get random questions from strangers (64:15 - 64:19)
why did will leave the show well Steve (64:17 - 64:21)
broke his foot with a mallet (64:19 - 64:23)
yes (64:21 - 64:25)
um correct uh so (64:23 - 64:28)
I will and I arrived Mall of America we (64:25 - 64:30)
start our community day the First Rate I (64:28 - 64:33)
join is uh Landorus (64:30 - 64:36)
and it ends up being tiny (64:33 - 64:39)
not shiny tiny I'm very happy though (64:36 - 64:43)
tiny Landorus I'm like whoo What A good (64:39 - 64:45)
good start to communicate (64:43 - 64:48)
tiny Landorus what this is good this is (64:45 - 64:49)
great (64:48 - 64:52)
and then I proceeded to fail to catch (64:49 - 64:55)
tiny Landorus oh no that will probably (64:52 - 64:57)
go down in history of my worst Community (64:55 - 64:59)
because I could have got a tiny (64:57 - 65:01)
legendary Pokemon and he ran away (64:59 - 65:03)
because he was way too and before anyone (65:01 - 65:07)
starts typing on the YouTube comments (65:03 - 65:10)
I was hitting greats non-stop I couldn't (65:07 - 65:12)
hit Excellence he was too tiny he's too (65:10 - 65:15)
little but I was golden razzing and (65:12 - 65:17)
hitting greats and I had like 12 Pokemon (65:15 - 65:20)
12 premiere balls (65:17 - 65:21)
I would have used a master ball on that (65:20 - 65:24)
holding the hands down like a A humongo (65:21 - 65:28)
or a tiny legendary hands down would use (65:24 - 65:30)
a master ball this is what we call (65:28 - 65:33)
Alessia and letting go (65:30 - 65:36)
some things in life are not meant to be (65:33 - 65:39)
and when you do not catch that thing it (65:36 - 65:43)
is the universe saying you need to let (65:39 - 65:45)
things go be at peace with what comes (65:43 - 65:48)
your way and what leaves your way tiny (65:45 - 65:50)
Landorus is not for you it's for (65:48 - 65:52)
somebody else to come up you go look at (65:50 - 65:54)
I got (65:52 - 65:56)
Chris (65:54 - 65:57)
bring me your (65:56 - 65:59)
ear before it and you will do it because (65:57 - 66:01)
that's who you are (65:59 - 66:02)
it's true (66:01 - 66:05)
see the the real the real scam is me (66:02 - 66:08)
baiting people online because I (66:05 - 66:11)
I trade what was this what was this (66:08 - 66:13)
thing I saw in your stories where you're (66:11 - 66:16)
trading an Entei for uh for a shiny (66:13 - 66:19)
scarf okay okay hold on hold on Hannah (66:16 - 66:22)
do you think shiny Entei for shiny (66:19 - 66:27)
costume Spiel was a good trade (66:22 - 66:27)
I mean it's easy enough to have a (66:29 - 66:33)
collection of shiny Entei from the (66:31 - 66:36)
distribution back however long ago and (66:33 - 66:37)
it was harder to get the shiny costumes (66:36 - 66:40)
feel so if you care about still having (66:37 - 66:43)
the Pokemon in Pokemon go it's not an (66:40 - 66:45)
awful trade (66:43 - 66:47)
and I'm disappointed I have so many (66:45 - 66:50)
shiny ante they're not from Pokemon go (66:47 - 66:52)
they're not in Pokemon go but I have so (66:50 - 66:54)
many shiny NJ (66:52 - 66:56)
so I I (66:54 - 67:00)
so I traded Greg Greg and I were lucky (66:56 - 67:01)
friends which is really funny because (67:00 - 67:03)
literally the day after we did our lucky (67:01 - 67:06)
trade we became lucky friends again and (67:03 - 67:09)
I haven't seen Greg since then so here's (67:06 - 67:10)
the thing I find these things out on (67:09 - 67:13)
Instagram because I do not open (67:10 - 67:16)
first time I found out because I was (67:13 - 67:17)
tagged in the push of it oh we're lucky (67:16 - 67:20)
friends and then the second time it (67:17 - 67:23)
happened I thought why are you reposting (67:20 - 67:27)
this so I did say again (67:23 - 67:29)
yeah (67:27 - 67:31)
yeah Yep this is the key lucky friends (67:29 - 67:33)
with me just I never opened the app but (67:31 - 67:35)
it's finally like oh lure them in lure (67:33 - 67:37)
them in see it Niantic listens to the (67:35 - 67:38)
show they they were like this is how we (67:37 - 67:40)
get Greg to keep playing (67:38 - 67:43)
um so when Greg and I were lucky friends (67:40 - 67:45)
the second time (67:43 - 67:48)
I was like oh we that was on Slowpoke (67:45 - 67:51)
Community yeah and at the end of (67:48 - 67:54)
Slowpoke Community I got all bad shiny (67:51 - 67:56)
slowpokes and I was really bummed (67:54 - 67:58)
because I wanted a good shiny Slowpoke (67:56 - 68:00)
so I could evolve it to get (67:58 - 68:04)
Shiny Mega Slowbro because I like the (68:00 - 68:06)
Mega Evolution in Pokemon go (68:04 - 68:08)
so (68:06 - 68:11)
when Greg and I initially did the first (68:08 - 68:12)
lucky I don't even know what we were (68:11 - 68:14)
traded for the first lucky trade I don't (68:12 - 68:16)
know the second one this was the first (68:14 - 68:18)
one oh yeah that was the first one seen (68:16 - 68:20)
you but before that like usually this is (68:18 - 68:22)
what happens with all Lucky trades I (68:20 - 68:24)
anytime like I see someone like when I (68:22 - 68:26)
went to Seattle for go Fest or (68:24 - 68:29)
um you know Germany for go Fest or (68:26 - 68:32)
London and I'm like oh we're lucky (68:29 - 68:33)
friends what should we lucky trade the (68:32 - 68:36)
the the standard answer is oh I don't (68:33 - 68:39)
know like no one knows what they want (68:36 - 68:40)
yeah I know (68:39 - 68:44)
you can't say no one knows I know I have (68:40 - 68:46)
an ultimate goal (68:44 - 68:48)
so anyone hearing this now will know if (68:46 - 68:51)
they trade with me for a lucky I want a (68:48 - 68:53)
shiny female Sneasel (68:51 - 68:57)
I have it I I we talked about this this (68:53 - 68:59)
is the other problem in Pokemon go is (68:57 - 69:01)
your lucky friend with somebody for like (68:59 - 69:03)
16 years (69:01 - 69:07)
yeah beginning of 2020 January 2020. I'm (69:03 - 69:10)
I'm typing a shiny (69:07 - 69:10)
Australia and that is just a thing that (69:11 - 69:18)
is that is just for us because that's (69:14 - 69:18)
um but my ultimate goal is to get a (69:19 - 69:23)
shiny hundred percent female Sneasel (69:21 - 69:26)
wait Lucky's enough (69:23 - 69:30)
I have five shiny female sneezles yeah (69:26 - 69:33)
you have any of them (69:30 - 69:34)
and they're like well give me that one (69:33 - 69:37)
and he'll go not that one someday one of (69:34 - 69:38)
them will be a hundo I have maybe (69:37 - 69:41)
between 20 and 30 at this point from (69:38 - 69:43)
Lucky trades (69:41 - 69:46)
so the the lucky trade that Greg and I (69:43 - 69:49)
did I was like I want (69:46 - 69:52)
a shiny Slowpoke because I want it lucky (69:49 - 69:55)
and I want good IVs for it to evolve (69:52 - 69:58)
into Mega Slowbro this is what I want (69:55 - 70:00)
like I want Megan silver but I also want (69:58 - 70:01)
lucky because I'm trying to complete my (70:00 - 70:04)
lucky ducks very slowly but (70:01 - 70:06)
um this is perfect because a lucky (70:04 - 70:09)
Pokemon I plan to power up all the way I (70:06 - 70:11)
plan to Mega Evolve it's much cheaper (70:09 - 70:13)
Stardust wise (70:11 - 70:15)
and Greg said I want a shiny Verizon and (70:13 - 70:18)
I was like cool I have like six of them (70:15 - 70:20)
yeah (70:18 - 70:22)
um and so I did that trade and I was (70:20 - 70:23)
like oh I'm gonna post this on Twitter (70:22 - 70:24)
because people are gonna be mad and (70:23 - 70:26)
they're gonna say the exact words of you (70:24 - 70:29)
got scammed but I didn't get skimmed (70:26 - 70:32)
because let me tell you please explain (70:29 - 70:35)
to me how much you think shiny Verizon (70:32 - 70:37)
is worth because it has been sitting in (70:35 - 70:39)
my box for like four and a half years (70:37 - 70:44)
called wasting space doing nothing and (70:39 - 70:47)
who wants it the fact that Greg was like (70:44 - 70:49)
the fact that Greg was like I want a (70:47 - 70:53)
virusian I was like please take one (70:49 - 70:57)
so so last night I traded shiny Entei (70:53 - 71:00)
for shiny costumes feel (70:57 - 71:05)
and they were like I'm missing shiny (71:00 - 71:08)
Entei suikunan raiko I was like cool I (71:05 - 71:11)
typed in suicune and I had six shiny (71:08 - 71:14)
suicune and I was like cool you want one (71:11 - 71:17)
of these that I checked the date they (71:14 - 71:18)
were from (71:17 - 71:20)
2019. oh yeah there were all those those (71:18 - 71:23)
were the first raid days yeah so the (71:20 - 71:24)
version was probably not four years old (71:23 - 71:25)
the version is probably (71:24 - 71:30)
three years oh take it back (71:25 - 71:30)
and then they were like do you have (71:32 - 71:37)
Entei and I was like ah no I'm probably (71:35 - 71:39)
out of Entei I probably only have one or (71:37 - 71:43)
one left so I typed in Entei I had five (71:39 - 71:46)
shy I thought I had one yeah this is so (71:43 - 71:48)
when so in my like where it's like oh (71:46 - 71:51)
you got scammed you like I literally (71:48 - 71:54)
thought I had one shiny I had five and I (71:51 - 71:55)
didn't even know it there is no scam (71:54 - 71:57)
here these are worth nothing I want this (71:55 - 72:01)
feel a million Stardust sure what else (71:57 - 72:04)
am I gonna do with this (72:01 - 72:09)
the The Shining Academy is bust I don't (72:04 - 72:11)
know it all depends on what Pokemon you (72:09 - 72:12)
have and what Pokemon you want yeah like (72:11 - 72:15)
I want it shiny lucky Slowpoke and I got (72:12 - 72:17)
it from Greg and I I love him he's great (72:15 - 72:21)
I also specifically said I wanted a boy (72:17 - 72:23)
and I made that happen that's true (72:21 - 72:25)
that's true I was like because I want I (72:23 - 72:28)
wanted a boy Mega Slowbro (72:25 - 72:30)
so you can revamped the mega system and (72:28 - 72:32)
it's actually (72:30 - 72:35)
good ish yeah now the mega system's (72:32 - 72:38)
pretty good yeah (72:35 - 72:38)
um well speaking of Megas uh Mewtwo (72:39 - 72:44)
doesn't have omega yet even though that (72:42 - 72:48)
was teased like two years ago (72:44 - 72:51)
doing these things in in the yearly (72:48 - 72:53)
images with all of the things that you (72:51 - 72:55)

year (72:55 - 72:57)
and they don't come out in the next year (72:56 - 72:59)
playing the long game when they say (72:57 - 73:01)
10-year game they really matter they (72:59 - 73:03)
really mean it we're gonna string you (73:01 - 73:05)
along for 10 years (73:03 - 73:09)
uh Shadows are rising uh Team Rocket has (73:05 - 73:12)
grown more audacious they discovered how (73:09 - 73:14)
to leave Shadow Pokemon to defend gems (73:12 - 73:17)
these shadow raids are unlike any (73:14 - 73:19)
challenges trainers have faced and go (73:17 - 73:22)
what's more Shadow Mewtwo will return to (73:19 - 73:24)
Pokemon go in Shadow raids I have a (73:22 - 73:27)
shadow Mewtwo that's a 98 and there was (73:24 - 73:28)
part of me that was like well if I (73:27 - 73:32)
purify it it'll be 100. (73:28 - 73:35)
I love collecting the hundreds (73:32 - 73:37)
that's another thing I like I like shiny (73:35 - 73:40)
costume Pokemon and I like a hundreds if (73:37 - 73:42)
you want if you really want Hannah the (73:40 - 73:45)
Mewtwo is suffering it is it could (73:42 - 73:49)
cleanse its heart and its soul (73:45 - 73:52)
it's Miss it's treated poorly did you (73:49 - 73:54)
know that I'm making waves in the (73:52 - 73:57)
Pokemon PVP go world right now because (73:54 - 73:59)
of this very issue (73:57 - 74:02)
clumsy isn't there actually a (73:59 - 74:04)
purified Pokemon that is good for PVP (74:02 - 74:07)
there are a couple yeah mostly it's (74:04 - 74:09)
mostly Shadow but there's like two or (74:07 - 74:12)
three periods sably is one of them oh (74:09 - 74:13)
okay okay (74:12 - 74:15)
um (74:13 - 74:17)
uh so Shadow Mewtwo will return to (74:15 - 74:19)
Pokemon go and Shadow raids for the (74:17 - 74:21)
first time you'll be able to encounter a (74:19 - 74:25)
shiny Shadow Mewtwo if you're lucky (74:21 - 74:26)
um Shadow Mewtwo will appear in five (74:25 - 74:29)
star raids on Saturday May 27th from 10 (74:26 - 74:31)
a.m to 8 P.M (74:29 - 74:33)
and then there will be other Shadow (74:31 - 74:35)
raids that will also start uh those will (74:33 - 74:38)
start on Monday uh so this will start at (74:35 - 74:39)
10 A.M on Monday if you're listening to (74:38 - 74:41)
this podcast on Monday they will go for (74:39 - 74:44)
about a week and for your one Stars you (74:41 - 74:47)
will get shiny poly shadow polywag (74:44 - 74:49)
shadow Machop Shadow bell sprout Shadow (74:47 - 74:53)
Beldum not sure why Bellsprout doesn't (74:49 - 74:55)
have a shiny symbol next to his name (74:53 - 74:58)
because the only shiny the only Shadow (74:55 - 75:00)
Pokemon that can be shiny are the ones (74:58 - 75:02)
that the team leaders have had got it (75:00 - 75:04)
okay (75:02 - 75:06)
so unfortunately no team leaders like (75:04 - 75:09)
Bellsprout enough (75:06 - 75:09)
uh three star raids will be Shadow bay (75:15 - 75:20)
leaf shadow qualava shadow crocodile and (75:18 - 75:24)
then Shadow shiny sneak Shadow Sneasel (75:20 - 75:27)
I heard if it's a female Shadow shiny (75:24 - 75:29)
Sneasel Hannah may want it but you can't (75:27 - 75:31)
trade a shadow you'd have to pee yeah (75:29 - 75:32)
you'd have to purify it first and you (75:31 - 75:34)
know adding purification to that list if (75:32 - 75:37)
it was a hundo that would be even better (75:34 - 75:40)
yeah (75:37 - 75:40)
um (75:40 - 75:44)
there will be uh the following Pokemon (75:41 - 75:45)
will appear in raids Jim's either taken (75:44 - 75:47)
over by Shadow or one of the bosses so (75:45 - 75:49)
one star raids will have Clefairy (75:47 - 75:50)
tentacles these are not Shadow by the (75:49 - 75:53)
way Clefairy technical Merrell Skrelp (75:50 - 75:55)
popplio (75:53 - 75:58)
the where's Litton and Rowlett who knows (75:55 - 75:59)
um three star raids will be Magneton (75:58 - 76:02)
Lapras small while Empoleon (75:59 - 76:03)
five-star raids will be Reggie gigas (76:02 - 76:06)
tapufini Mega raids are Mega pincer and (76:03 - 76:10)
Mega Altaria (76:06 - 76:10)
this is like (76:10 - 76:15)
my problem isn't the shadow raids my (76:12 - 76:17)
problem is why are there so many raids (76:15 - 76:21)
at once like is the amount of like am I (76:17 - 76:22)
gonna go to mall America and be like oh (76:21 - 76:24)
cool three Reggie gigas and no Shadow (76:22 - 76:26)
Mewtwo yep (76:24 - 76:29)
so the the normal raids will appear at (76:26 - 76:31)
normal gyms the shadow rates will appear (76:29 - 76:32)
at the gyms that the team leaders have (76:31 - 76:34)
taken over they just had to have the (76:32 - 76:35)
normal gym (76:34 - 76:38)
layout so the raids that would be going (76:35 - 76:40)
on without the event (76:38 - 76:43)
oh so they don't apply it so how do you (76:40 - 76:45)
know it's going to be a shadow gym (76:43 - 76:47)
the gyms will look different the gyms (76:45 - 76:51)
won't have a team in charge of them are (76:47 - 76:53)
they replacing current gems (76:51 - 76:56)
are they new gyms (76:53 - 77:01)
same gems so instead of instead of say (76:56 - 77:03)
you are as a trainer battle take down a (77:01 - 77:05)
gym put your Pokemon in there that gym (77:03 - 77:07)
is then team Valor (77:05 - 77:09)
that gym if it is going to be a shadow (77:07 - 77:12)
raid it'll kick I think everybody out (77:09 - 77:15)
and Team Rocket will team go rocket will (77:12 - 77:18)
take over that gym a team won't be in (77:15 - 77:19)
charge of that gym and that is why when (77:18 - 77:22)
you complete a shadow raid you don't get (77:19 - 77:25)
a uh extra premium (77:22 - 77:27)
uh (77:25 - 77:29)
an extra Pokeball to catch the Pokemon (77:27 - 77:31)
if you're (77:29 - 77:33)
you know how when you're you complete a (77:31 - 77:35)
raid if you're a team Valor if the gym (77:33 - 77:38)
is an extra Pokeball that bonus doesn't (77:35 - 77:40)
apply here it was a little bit confusing (77:38 - 77:42)
to me because there are so many (77:40 - 77:44)
different bonuses you can get when you (77:42 - 77:47)
finish a raid but it makes sense once (77:44 - 77:50)
you realize the gym won't be any of the (77:47 - 77:52)
teams it will just be a team go rocket (77:50 - 77:55)
gym basically (77:52 - 77:55)
I I feel like this (77:56 - 78:02)
is them trying to do the same thing to (77:59 - 78:05)
team go rocket that they did to Megas (78:02 - 78:07)
they're trying to do a big revamp here (78:05 - 78:09)
and I think that there are some (78:07 - 78:11)
positives (78:09 - 78:13)
but (78:11 - 78:16)
not not all positives it's not amazing (78:13 - 78:18)
they're taking two things that people (78:16 - 78:20)
aren't psyched about and putting them (78:18 - 78:22)
together (78:20 - 78:22)
um (78:22 - 78:25)
but you will be able to go after a (78:22 - 78:28)
certain Shadow Pokemon more easily (78:25 - 78:31)
yeah I like that I like being like (78:28 - 78:34)
cool I don't have (78:31 - 78:38)
a shadow bell sprout and instead of like (78:34 - 78:41)
tapping on trainers in the map and being (78:38 - 78:42)
like I don't (78:41 - 78:45)
know what I need to decipher here of (78:42 - 78:47)
whether this is a bell sprout or I don't (78:45 - 78:48)
know I don't even think you're like even (78:47 - 78:50)
guaranteed that right it could be like (78:48 - 78:52)
one of the three Pokemon they have (78:50 - 78:53)
so to be like oh I want to complete my (78:52 - 78:55)
shadow of Pokedex and there's just a (78:53 - 78:57)
Bellsprout raid and I can just do it and (78:55 - 79:00)
move on with life is it that that in (78:57 - 79:03)
itself is appealing but you cannot (79:00 - 79:08)
use remote raid passes for this (79:03 - 79:08)
um and I don't know why anyone's (79:08 - 79:12)
surprised about that no indicates remote (79:10 - 79:13)
raids (79:12 - 79:15)
that's not exactly true there are people (79:13 - 79:17)
at Niantic (79:15 - 79:19)
who themselves like remote raids but (79:17 - 79:23)
there is a push I have that right now (79:19 - 79:25)
I think I'm allowed to say this I have (79:23 - 79:27)
like 20 Niantic employees on my Pokemon (79:25 - 79:31)
go list because when I was in Seattle we (79:27 - 79:33)
like did a walking tour with with (79:31 - 79:37)
employees from Niantic and there was (79:33 - 79:39)
there's like two I think employees that (79:37 - 79:41)
weren't even on the Pokemon go team they (79:39 - 79:43)
were on like the Pikmin team and then (79:41 - 79:45)
the other ones were Pokemon go people (79:43 - 79:47)
like one of the people on the walk were (79:45 - 79:49)
was the the person who like revamped the (79:47 - 79:52)
mega system and then another person I (79:49 - 79:54)
was talking to (79:52 - 79:56)
um they (79:54 - 79:58)
they just worked on like clothing in the (79:56 - 80:00)
store so it was like cool it was it was (79:58 - 80:02)
like cool but like so I have them all (80:00 - 80:04)
like labeled this Niantic (80:02 - 80:07)
uh as their like nickname (80:04 - 80:09)
let me tell you if there's if there are (80:07 - 80:11)
people that invite me to raids more than (80:09 - 80:13)
others it is Niantic employees they are (80:11 - 80:15)
always sending out remote raid but like (80:13 - 80:19)
I'm getting I'm getting road so to say I (80:15 - 80:20)
know that people are like it's remote (80:19 - 80:23)
rates they're definitely employees there (80:20 - 80:25)
that love remote raids I'm getting (80:23 - 80:28)
invited all the time there's also like (80:25 - 80:29)
three Niantic employees where if I (80:28 - 80:31)
invite them I know for sure they're (80:29 - 80:32)
showing (80:31 - 80:34)
it's great (80:32 - 80:37)
I feel like everyone has like that one (80:34 - 80:38)
person on their friends list that you (80:37 - 80:40)
invite and you know that they're (80:38 - 80:44)
probably showing up no matter what (80:40 - 80:47)
like at this point that's less likely (80:44 - 80:49)
with the cap but (80:47 - 80:52)
still yeah (80:49 - 80:54)
um (80:52 - 80:57)
so you can subdue Shadow raid bosses (80:54 - 80:59)
using purified gems that's a new item (80:57 - 81:01)
that can be assembled from Shadow shards (80:59 - 81:04)
Shadow shards are a gem piece that will (81:01 - 81:06)
be dropped by team go rocket gather (81:04 - 81:09)
enough shards to use Professor Willow's (81:06 - 81:12)
newly invented Shard refiner you'll be (81:09 - 81:15)
rewarded with a purified gem there are (81:12 - 81:17)
multiple ways purified gems can assist (81:15 - 81:20)
you against the battle when you use a (81:17 - 81:22)
purified gem during a shadow raid the (81:20 - 81:24)
enrage Shadow boss's attack and defense (81:22 - 81:26)
will be lowered giving you an opening (81:24 - 81:29)
this kind of sounds like (81:26 - 81:32)
the opposite of like Z moves (81:29 - 81:34)
like instead of lowering their attack or (81:32 - 81:36)
defense like a z move would increase (81:34 - 81:39)
your attack and defense (81:36 - 81:43)
like I I still think I have Niantic has (81:39 - 81:45)
not talked about Z moves with me or at (81:43 - 81:47)
least with me I don't know maybe they I (81:45 - 81:49)
would assume that eventually Z moves (81:47 - 81:53)
would come to the game megas came (81:49 - 81:56)
again to Max more than I would expect Z (81:53 - 81:58)
moves now Z moves the you have to prop (81:56 - 81:59)
the camera up and actually do the dance (81:58 - 82:02)
has to do anything (81:59 - 82:05)
it records you doing the (82:02 - 82:08)
and then the Z move will go off my my (82:05 - 82:11)
like if I was to imagine how Z moves (82:08 - 82:13)
would work in Pokemon go I would imagine (82:11 - 82:16)
that either one you could just buy it as (82:13 - 82:18)
a temporary like one use kind of thing (82:16 - 82:21)
or two you would have to like do what (82:18 - 82:24)
team go rocket is which is like do six (82:21 - 82:28)
of them combined it now it works once so (82:24 - 82:31)
I always imagine that if they do Z moves (82:28 - 82:34)
and you had like three people at a mall (82:31 - 82:37)
trace and you're struggling and if one (82:34 - 82:39)
person used their Z move it would make (82:37 - 82:40)
it (82:39 - 82:42)
significantly easier for the three of (82:40 - 82:45)
you to do it versus like trying to find (82:42 - 82:46)
a fourth or a fifth (82:45 - 82:49)
but that's because you did like the work (82:46 - 82:52)
up to this point to hold on to a z move (82:49 - 82:53)
that's how I always thought it would (82:52 - 82:55)
work (82:53 - 82:56)
um (82:55 - 82:58)
but this is saying like you put this (82:56 - 83:01)
thing together purified gem together and (82:58 - 83:02)
when you use it instead of you getting (83:01 - 83:04)
more powerful (83:02 - 83:07)
the boss gets weaker weaker (83:04 - 83:10)
compared to where it's at at that point (83:07 - 83:11)
in the battle my understanding is that (83:10 - 83:14)
over the course of the raid the shadow (83:11 - 83:18)
red boss will get stronger what yeah (83:14 - 83:21)
that's crazy yeah so a three star or (83:18 - 83:24)
yeah a three-star raid won't be the (83:21 - 83:25)
difficulty you think it's going to be (83:24 - 83:27)
because it'll get harder throughout the (83:25 - 83:29)
raid as much okay but understanding then (83:27 - 83:32)
answer me why I want to do a three star (83:29 - 83:34)
Crocodile like (83:32 - 83:36)
if it's gonna get hard if I need like (83:34 - 83:39)
people to do it and it's gonna get (83:36 - 83:41)
harder am I getting some like sick (83:39 - 83:43)
reward is it dropping a master ball when (83:41 - 83:45)
I defeat it yeah what are the rewards (83:43 - 83:48)
here the shadow crocodile you get a (83:45 - 83:51)
chance to catch a ShadowCraft (83:48 - 83:51)
would be my guess and I don't know the (83:51 - 83:57)
shadow shards and the purified gems and (83:55 - 83:59)
the whole these raid bosses get more (83:57 - 84:02)
powerful as you're battling them (83:59 - 84:03)
thing (84:02 - 84:06)
I sure hope it's explained well both to (84:03 - 84:08)
players in the first place I know I know (84:06 - 84:12)
I know but (84:08 - 84:12)
I have had friends who are relatively (84:12 - 84:17)
new to the game (84:15 - 84:19)
or friends who have come back to the (84:17 - 84:21)
game after a certain time and the game (84:19 - 84:25)
has become so complicated yeah they're (84:21 - 84:28)
asking me so many questions of how (84:25 - 84:30)
things work and this is just adding to (84:28 - 84:33)
that oh that's so fashioned event (84:30 - 84:35)
somebody has been crushed by reality (84:33 - 84:39)
how's what does Hope feel like (84:35 - 84:39)
uh (84:41 - 84:44)
bless your heart the like Shadow Mewtwo (84:47 - 84:56)
and raids seems really cool uh (84:51 - 84:57)
you're just gonna need a bunch of people (84:56 - 85:01)
to do it in person (84:57 - 85:01)
which you know there was (85:01 - 85:08)
like four years of of that yes at one (85:03 - 85:10)
point I think that for something as (85:08 - 85:14)
important and as difficult as Mewtwo it (85:10 - 85:17)
worked pretty well with the ex raids (85:14 - 85:19)
when there was a time and place for (85:17 - 85:22)
people to get together when all of the (85:19 - 85:23)
communities I won't say all of the (85:22 - 85:24)
communities there are a lot of (85:23 - 85:26)
communities that are fracturing right (85:24 - 85:28)
now I feel like it's going to be hard to (85:26 - 85:32)
get people enough people even in some (85:28 - 85:34)
maybe not downtown areas but in some (85:32 - 85:36)
cities (85:34 - 85:39)
um to do these (85:36 - 85:39)
I could be wrong it is exciting there (85:39 - 85:44)
are more chances to get a higher IV (85:42 - 85:47)
Shadow Mewtwo and it is the strongest (85:44 - 85:50)
Pokemon in the game yeah I don't I don't (85:47 - 85:52)
know it's it's so hard to like tell (85:50 - 85:53)
because (85:52 - 85:54)
um (85:53 - 85:56)
you know (85:54 - 85:58)
I I would find I would (85:56 - 86:02)
say that I'm a hardcore Pokemon go (85:58 - 86:04)
player I mean I just talked about how I (86:02 - 86:07)
had like seven shiny entities (86:04 - 86:10)
collecting dust (86:07 - 86:12)
um (86:10 - 86:15)
and I (86:12 - 86:18)
I have not been in any discords or (86:15 - 86:21)
Facebook groups or any of that stuff (86:18 - 86:23)
um now obviously I live in a big city so (86:21 - 86:25)
I can use that to my advantage but (86:23 - 86:29)
I do think there is still and in no way (86:25 - 86:32)
again I feel like I always says in no (86:29 - 86:34)
way is this a defensive Niantic I think (86:32 - 86:35)
Niantic makes a lot of terrible (86:34 - 86:38)
decisions uh constantly they have very (86:35 - 86:41)
few good decisions and I will like the (86:38 - 86:43)
mega stuff that was good good revamp I (86:41 - 86:45)
will always applaud that revamp it was (86:43 - 86:49)
very good but (86:45 - 86:49)
there's always part of me that's like (86:50 - 86:55)
the the people that are doing 20 plus (86:51 - 86:58)
raids a day in a Discord they are going (86:55 - 87:00)
to be very loud when this is taken away (86:58 - 87:03)
but I cannot imagine that is the (87:00 - 87:05)
majority of Pokemon go players to sit in (87:03 - 87:09)
a Discord and whatever you determine fun (87:05 - 87:11)
if you think that's fun to spend 20 a (87:09 - 87:14)
day remote rating in a Discord (87:11 - 87:18)
do whatever you want with your money but (87:14 - 87:20)
I don't think that's like the majority (87:18 - 87:22)
of players (87:20 - 87:22)
so I have been a part of a bunch of (87:25 - 87:30)
different Pokemon go communities I was (87:28 - 87:33)
part of the local one before College I (87:30 - 87:35)
was part of the one I started and ran (87:33 - 87:38)
the one at my college I have kind of (87:35 - 87:40)
gone and found the Discord for local (87:38 - 87:41)
communities whenever I go and travel to (87:40 - 87:43)
a place (87:41 - 87:44)
if especially if there's going to be a (87:43 - 87:47)
community there so that I can kind of (87:44 - 87:49)
figure out where people go for the (87:47 - 87:52)
community day and it does seem like (87:49 - 87:55)
there are fewer people there is less (87:52 - 87:57)
activity people oh no I agree with that (87:55 - 88:00)
did do the remote raids a whole bunch (87:57 - 88:04)
maybe not to the extent that the people (88:00 - 88:05)
who are the most angry about the change (88:04 - 88:08)
did but people still use remote rates (88:05 - 88:12)
Even in our local the first Pokemon go (88:08 - 88:13)
Community I joined everybody lives in (88:12 - 88:15)
the same neighborhood (88:13 - 88:17)
it was just convenient (88:15 - 88:20)
oh yeah no I I I I was having this (88:17 - 88:23)
conversation with uh uh (88:20 - 88:25)
with a person last night of you know I (88:23 - 88:27)
think we've had the same scenario on the (88:25 - 88:29)
podcast before you joined Hannah and I'm (88:27 - 88:31)
sure you've heard it before but like if (88:29 - 88:33)
there's if there's a (88:31 - 88:36)
a drudd again down the street for me and (88:33 - 88:38)
it takes me 10 minutes to walk to drudd (88:36 - 88:40)
again another five minutes to do drug (88:38 - 88:41)
again and then another 10 minutes back (88:40 - 88:45)
that's 25 minutes out of my day (88:41 - 88:47)
um which if I am going to Mall of (88:45 - 88:49)
America for like three hours I am (88:47 - 88:50)
dedicating that time to Pokemon go I (88:49 - 88:52)
love that time I'm obviously usually (88:50 - 88:54)
with Greg or will or whatever (88:52 - 88:57)
um but if I'm like working on a YouTube (88:54 - 88:59)
video and I'm like okay (88:57 - 89:02)
well I have like an hour before I have (88:59 - 89:03)
to stream if I walk to the start again (89:02 - 89:06)
that's like 25 minutes but if I just (89:03 - 89:08)
spend a dollar I can get 20 minutes back (89:06 - 89:11)
and 20 minutes a lot of time and a (89:08 - 89:13)
dollar is not a lot of money (89:11 - 89:15)
but if you're doing that like (89:13 - 89:17)
a couple times a week (89:15 - 89:20)
I think the convenience is there (89:17 - 89:24)
and worth it (89:20 - 89:26)
um (89:24 - 89:29)
but on the other side of things I cannot (89:26 - 89:32)
imagine giving a mobile game even (89:29 - 89:34)
twenty dollars a week that's a lot like (89:32 - 89:36)
I I've played Pikmin for (89:34 - 89:39)
1.5 years because I think that's the (89:36 - 89:41)
anniversary they just celebrated (89:39 - 89:44)
in that time I have given in in a in (89:41 - 89:46)
over a year I have given Pikmin exactly (89:44 - 89:48)
thirty dollars (89:46 - 89:50)
and I love pick it's great but that's (89:48 - 89:53)
that's not even (89:50 - 89:57)
that's like 250 a month like like three (89:53 - 90:00)
dollars a month or something like that's (89:57 - 90:02)
I don't regret giving Pikmin thirty (90:00 - 90:03)
dollars (90:02 - 90:05)
but (90:03 - 90:07)
and I play Pikmin every day (90:05 - 90:08)
um (90:07 - 90:11)
but again do what you want with your (90:08 - 90:13)
money obviously Niantic said we don't (90:11 - 90:16)
want your money anymore (90:13 - 90:16)
kinda did (90:16 - 90:21)
also raise the remote (90:18 - 90:24)
yeah (90:21 - 90:27)
but this is just rehashing that my my (90:24 - 90:30)
point was that I'm not sure how well (90:27 - 90:32)
these shadow Mewtwo raids are gonna work (90:30 - 90:34)
I'm not sure how easily people are going (90:32 - 90:36)
to be able to get together for them and (90:34 - 90:39)
yeah that's a great Point that's why I I (90:36 - 90:40)
went out to Reggie Drago and Reggie (90:39 - 90:44)
aliki because I wanted to yeah and those (90:40 - 90:45)
are a little easier because those have a (90:44 - 90:48)
set time yes (90:45 - 90:48)
I was blown away about well you know if (90:50 - 90:55)
it even worked in your area yeah I was I (90:53 - 90:56)
was blown away about how many people (90:55 - 91:00)
showed up to Drago like there was over (90:56 - 91:04)
30 people and when I was in the Discord (91:00 - 91:05)
because that was when I was like I'll (91:04 - 91:07)
try to join a Discord Greg where are the (91:05 - 91:10)
good discords they were only in the (91:07 - 91:12)
Discord four or five people talking (91:10 - 91:15)
about it so I only expected (91:12 - 91:17)
and 30 people I don't know where these (91:15 - 91:19)
people (91:17 - 91:21)
you got to check Facebook you gotta find (91:19 - 91:23)
the other Discord you gotta check (91:21 - 91:26)
campfire it's just fractured (91:23 - 91:29)
um so this I I guess our final bit of (91:26 - 91:31)
Pokemon Go stuff this is off DOTA (91:29 - 91:32)
Esports (91:31 - 91:35)
there's an interview with uh what What's (91:32 - 91:36)
his what's his name (91:35 - 91:37)
um (91:36 - 91:39)
Michael (91:37 - 91:41)
stir stir I don't know how to say his (91:39 - 91:44)
last name sorenka (91:41 - 91:46)
we'll just say Michael he's the Pokemon (91:44 - 91:51)
go director uh I've met him once uh (91:46 - 91:55)
I met him in Seattle he seemed nice (91:51 - 91:55)
uh so DOTA who who asked us who did this (91:56 - 92:02)
interview was this interview actually go (91:59 - 92:03)
to Esports (92:02 - 92:05)
I think it was (92:03 - 92:08)
yeah that Esports asked (92:05 - 92:09)
um (92:08 - 92:11)
they asked them uh how they felt about (92:09 - 92:13)
the heroes Niantic Trend and the remote (92:11 - 92:15)
raid passage changes and he said quote (92:13 - 92:17)
we have definitely taken note it's hard (92:15 - 92:19)
to ignore right I'm personally being (92:17 - 92:21)
tagged in a lot of these tweets we read (92:19 - 92:23)
everything we see everything it's one of (92:21 - 92:24)
those things where we never want to go (92:23 - 92:28)
out and respond to two calls like that (92:24 - 92:29)
unless we have something to actually (92:28 - 92:31)
show for it and for us for the rest of (92:29 - 92:33)
the year we really feel like actions (92:31 - 92:35)
will speak louder than words we've been (92:33 - 92:37)
working really hard as a development (92:35 - 92:39)
team to put together a huge slate of new (92:37 - 92:41)
features that will apply allow players (92:39 - 92:43)
to enjoy over the course of this year so (92:41 - 92:45)
personally speaking I'm pretty sure I (92:43 - 92:48)
used to do remote raids uh (92:45 - 92:50)
I'm pretty sure I used to do more remote (92:48 - 92:53)
raids than 99 of your readers (92:50 - 92:56)
we'll stop there for now (92:53 - 92:58)
um (92:56 - 92:58)
I don't I don't think he's lying about (92:59 - 93:05)
doing remote raids like no (93:02 - 93:06)
I I I (93:05 - 93:11)
do dislike the consensus of like Niantic (93:06 - 93:12)
is trying to kill this game Niantic (93:11 - 93:15)
Kate's Pokemon go players again what I (93:12 - 93:17)
like I (93:15 - 93:19)
everyone I've ever talked to at Niantic (93:17 - 93:20)
with the exception of one person he (93:19 - 93:23)
doesn't even work there anymore (93:20 - 93:23)
love Pokemon (93:24 - 93:31)
and they they were all really excited to (93:27 - 93:33)
talk or to trade or to like like they (93:31 - 93:36)
genuinely like Pokemon (93:33 - 93:38)
um (93:36 - 93:40)
so I I do (93:38 - 93:44)
believe him that he he was a big remote (93:40 - 93:47)
Raider I have no doubt there (93:44 - 93:49)
um he then goes on and says there was a (93:47 - 93:51)
very very painful decision to make even (93:49 - 93:53)
for me but when we look at the overall (93:51 - 93:54)
health of the game and the types of (93:53 - 93:56)
behavior that remote raid passes were (93:54 - 93:58)
introducing it just didn't align with (93:56 - 94:00)
the kind of experience we were trying to (93:58 - 94:01)
create (94:00 - 94:03)
and honestly I can say even personally (94:01 - 94:05)
for me it became some it became sort of (94:03 - 94:08)
an unhealthy way to engage with the game (94:05 - 94:10)
I would just sort of throw money at (94:08 - 94:12)
pokecoins and then spam legendary raids (94:10 - 94:16)
as much as possible I I believe this (94:12 - 94:16)
um (94:16 - 94:18)
and if we're talking about legendary (94:16 - 94:20)
Pokemon there's supposed to be this epic (94:18 - 94:23)
epitome of all Pokemon content something (94:20 - 94:25)
that players including myself are doing (94:23 - 94:27)
a dozen times a day some people over a (94:25 - 94:29)
hundred times a day you know who you are (94:27 - 94:32)
and there are uh there's something that (94:29 - 94:34)
we were really honestly let go on a (94:32 - 94:36)
little bit too long and ultimately (94:34 - 94:38)
needed to correct course (94:36 - 94:40)
so again super super painful decision (94:38 - 94:42)
something that we didn't take lightly (94:40 - 94:43)
but it's something that we felt was (94:42 - 94:44)
necessary for the longevity of the game (94:43 - 94:46)
to also ensure that we're not (94:44 - 94:49)
compromising on our mission (94:46 - 94:50)
uh and so yeah we have no plans to (94:49 - 94:52)
direct the hero scientic thing recently (94:50 - 94:54)
because we are sticking to the decisions (94:52 - 94:56)
that we made but instead we're hoping (94:54 - 94:58)
we're hopeful that players will see a (94:56 - 94:59)
lot of hard work that the team has been (94:58 - 95:01)
putting out the last year because I (94:59 - 95:03)
think we have coming what we have in (95:01 - 95:05)
coming in 2023 is really going to blow (95:03 - 95:06)
people away (95:05 - 95:09)
uh and before comments it's epitome (95:06 - 95:13)
thank you Greg what's that mean epitome (95:09 - 95:15)
yeah (95:13 - 95:20)
uh so it is (95:15 - 95:24)
generally like a perfect example or a (95:20 - 95:26)
high quality so when you're saying this (95:24 - 95:28)
is the epitome of like we could say this (95:26 - 95:31)
is the epitome of Pokemon podcasts (95:28 - 95:33)
meaning that we have perfected (95:31 - 95:35)
everything we are the Golden State we (95:33 - 95:37)
should be saying that every time (95:35 - 95:41)
people would disagree but uh is it (95:37 - 95:43)
possible we have Hannah now this is the (95:41 - 95:45)
epitome (95:43 - 95:45)
so epitome generally means it's the (95:46 - 95:51)
ideal the perfect (95:49 - 95:55)
example of X so when they say Legendary (95:51 - 95:57)
Pokemons this was the epitome of all (95:55 - 95:59)
Pokemon content they're saying like (95:57 - 96:02)
these are the ideal super Pokemon that (95:59 - 96:04)
you want to get which I at that point (96:02 - 96:07)
completely disagree but whatever I mean (96:04 - 96:10)
they're not Rosalia (96:07 - 96:10)
we we know which what we know where they (96:10 - 96:14)
peaked it has been downhill slide ever (96:13 - 96:18)
since it pulled it back with thinkatone (96:14 - 96:20)
um all of this is very corporate and I (96:18 - 96:22)
applaud them for making corporate speak (96:20 - 96:24)
sound human (96:22 - 96:27)
it is Corporate but (96:24 - 96:30)
I I can't say I disagree with uh (96:27 - 96:32)
legendary Pokemon are supposed to feel (96:30 - 96:34)
legendary but if you're doing like 20 a (96:32 - 96:37)
day does it really feel (96:34 - 96:39)
like a special Pokemon at that point (96:37 - 96:40)
like like there is part of me that's (96:39 - 96:43)
like I can't uh disagree with that logic (96:40 - 96:45)
I mean saying that doesn't make anyone (96:43 - 96:48)
feel better but I feel like them saying (96:45 - 96:51)
we created this problem and they did our (96:48 - 96:54)
whole game is like you can still do a (96:51 - 96:56)
bunch of these in person our whole game (96:54 - 97:00)
is about ruining the Epic legendary (96:56 - 97:03)
value and so now we're going to try to (97:00 - 97:05)
fix it by limiting that to get back like (97:03 - 97:08)
it is like you made the problem which I (97:05 - 97:10)
think is a good way to go like I think (97:08 - 97:14)
these things need to be devalued I am I (97:10 - 97:16)
think shinies need to be devalued I (97:14 - 97:18)
think legendaries need to be devalued I (97:16 - 97:20)
think mythicals which stand for (97:18 - 97:22)
marketing need to be devalued I think (97:20 - 97:23)
these things need to be brought away (97:22 - 97:25)
from the brink because I do not think (97:23 - 97:29)
that the inherent view of value is good (97:25 - 97:33)
for this community or this fandom (97:29 - 97:36)
I'm not sure I'm 100 agree with Greg (97:33 - 97:39)
but I will say if the issue was people (97:36 - 97:41)
were doing too many of these then they (97:39 - 97:42)
could cap it without raising the prices (97:41 - 97:44)
if the issue was they were devaluating (97:42 - 97:46)
devaluing legendaries then they could (97:44 - 97:48)
cap the six star raids but leave the (97:46 - 97:50)
rest of the raids open so that people (97:48 - 97:51)
could keep doing them with friends as (97:50 - 97:53)
much as they want (97:51 - 97:56)
I I didn't do either of those (97:53 - 97:59)
I I (97:56 - 97:59)
I don't want to come off as like a (98:00 - 98:04)
Niantic apologist (98:02 - 98:07)
yet here we are here we are on this show (98:04 - 98:09)
I'm in the big pocket of Niantic but (98:07 - 98:11)
like if I (98:09 - 98:14)
they're they're I think there are like (98:11 - 98:15)
two separate issues (98:14 - 98:18)
the one issue is like legendary Pokemon (98:15 - 98:20)
don't feel very legendary when you can (98:18 - 98:23)
like catch 20 of them in a day right I I (98:20 - 98:25)
do think (98:23 - 98:28)
of like a scenario with my mom (98:25 - 98:31)
where she of all the Pokemon she wanted (98:28 - 98:33)
she wanted me to (98:31 - 98:36)
and she's like a huge genwuner and like (98:33 - 98:37)
that was like the one Pokemon she wanted (98:36 - 98:39)
and I like took her out for communion (98:37 - 98:40)
day (98:39 - 98:42)
which I've done like three Community (98:40 - 98:44)
Days with my mom and one of the (98:42 - 98:46)
communities Mewtwo was the raid Pokemon (98:44 - 98:49)
and I was like cool let's walk over to (98:46 - 98:51)
this Mewtwo raid we'll jump in she's (98:49 - 98:53)
like no I've tried this before no one (98:51 - 98:55)
ever joins like I've done it with like (98:53 - 98:57)
my co-worker there's two of us Mewtwo's (98:55 - 99:00)
too strong we can't beat them and like (98:57 - 99:02)
we jumped in the Mewtwo raid and it (99:00 - 99:04)
started filling up and she's like oh my (99:02 - 99:05)
gosh there are like 12 people in this (99:04 - 99:07)
raid I was like yeah it's Community Day (99:05 - 99:09)
and then it got up to 20 and we're doing (99:07 - 99:11)
the raid and she's like I don't know if (99:09 - 99:12)
we're gonna get this like she was like (99:11 - 99:14)
genuine she was like she was like I (99:12 - 99:15)
don't know if we're gonna be able to (99:14 - 99:18)
catch this and then we defeated it and (99:15 - 99:20)
she was so excited and then she was like (99:18 - 99:22)
scared to catch it and she caught it and (99:20 - 99:24)
she was like she was like I'm so happy (99:22 - 99:26)
like this is my head she made a Mewtwo (99:24 - 99:29)
her buddy like instantly like (99:26 - 99:29)
there's like a special feeling there (99:30 - 99:35)
right oh yeah and that that is memorable (99:32 - 99:41)
and I understand like from a lore slash (99:35 - 99:43)
game that they're trying to create that (99:41 - 99:47)
they want Pokemon to feel special (99:43 - 99:51)
um in some way and there is like you (99:47 - 99:53)
know for people who Minimax you kind of (99:51 - 99:55)
lose that special (99:53 - 99:58)
the the surprise and Delight there when (99:55 - 99:59)
you're just pumping out like 20 mewtwos (99:58 - 100:01)
in a day because you can just throw (99:59 - 100:02)
dollars at it (100:01 - 100:05)
so like that's like one issue and so I (100:02 - 100:07)
do agree that how do you make these more (100:05 - 100:10)
special that isn't like (100:07 - 100:11)
like you made this problem that people (100:10 - 100:13)
like loved and then you took it away (100:11 - 100:15)
right but then there's the other problem (100:13 - 100:18)
of like the prices where (100:15 - 100:23)
like for a hundred coins I could get a (100:18 - 100:26)
Mewtwo but also for a hundred coins I (100:23 - 100:29)
could get 20 pokeballs who in their (100:26 - 100:32)
right mind is buying the 20 pokeballs (100:29 - 100:35)
for a hundred coins like like uh that's (100:32 - 100:37)
like a hypothetical question because (100:35 - 100:38)
like somebody would be like me because I (100:37 - 100:40)
had no pokeballs left right yeah but (100:38 - 100:42)
like realistically you could if you had (100:40 - 100:45)
like three pokestops relatively close (100:42 - 100:46)
together you could walk in a circle for (100:45 - 100:47)
five minutes and you would probably have (100:46 - 100:50)
like 30 pokeballs right (100:47 - 100:51)
um (100:50 - 100:53)
so there's like this weird pricing thing (100:51 - 100:55)
that was also niantic's fault for the (100:53 - 100:57)
way by the way again like if I look at (100:55 - 100:59)
the store it's like (100:57 - 101:02)
six Max revives 180 coins (100:59 - 101:04)
yeah there are some wild boxes out there (101:02 - 101:08)
yep uh a poffin a hundred coins a soup (101:04 - 101:10)
like a super incubator you could get (101:08 - 101:13)
possibly Hannah you could get three (101:10 - 101:17)
bronzers from an egg for for 200 coins (101:13 - 101:20)
or you could get a Mewtwo for a hundred (101:17 - 101:21)
coins (101:20 - 101:24)
again they created this problem they did (101:21 - 101:26)
say remote rate passes were discounted (101:24 - 101:28)
they were discounted for what four years (101:26 - 101:31)
yeah and so then they raised the prices (101:28 - 101:33)
people are under I I uh people are (101:31 - 101:35)
understandably mad I get it I totally (101:33 - 101:39)
I'm I'm with you but like you created a (101:35 - 101:42)
problem where people were (101:39 - 101:45)
I like the word they used unhealthy (101:42 - 101:49)
an unhealthy habit of just throwing (101:45 - 101:50)
money (101:49 - 101:53)
and it almost feels gambly to me it (101:50 - 101:54)
almost feels like slot machine to me (101:53 - 101:57)
like I didn't win big for the shiny (101:54 - 101:59)
Mewtwo another dollar pull the lever (101:57 - 102:02)
okay not not shiny okay another dollar (101:59 - 102:04)
pull the lever not shiny I don't know if (102:02 - 102:05)
that's what they're like leaning into (102:04 - 102:07)
when they say like unhealthy (102:05 - 102:12)
um yeah I mean the idea to (102:07 - 102:15)
the one thing I sort of agree is you (102:12 - 102:17)
know you created a problem you've (102:15 - 102:18)
created people who can develop a very (102:17 - 102:20)
unhealthy relationship with this (102:18 - 102:21)
especially if they're spending a ton of (102:20 - 102:23)
money (102:21 - 102:25)
um and that you are trying to correct (102:23 - 102:28)
that behavior (102:25 - 102:28)
um (102:28 - 102:31)
you know we sort of Step into the how (102:28 - 102:33)
like what is over correction what does (102:31 - 102:35)
correction look like especially when you (102:33 - 102:37)
created the problem (102:35 - 102:41)
um what is that ultimately mean and I I (102:37 - 102:43)
understand like I understand the (102:41 - 102:44)
decision (102:43 - 102:47)
uh to some extent (102:44 - 102:50)
but also (102:47 - 102:53)
in most of the things they did it felt (102:50 - 102:56)
like they hyper focused on the one (102:53 - 102:57)
target (102:56 - 103:00)
that supports the decisions at the (102:57 - 103:01)
expense of a lot of things that come (103:00 - 103:04)
along with that decision and at the (103:01 - 103:06)
expense of (103:04 - 103:09)
all of the ramifications out of it which (103:06 - 103:10)
they don't (103:09 - 103:12)
talk about so again this is a very (103:10 - 103:14)
corporate situation because he's hyper (103:12 - 103:16)
focusing and getting you to personally (103:14 - 103:19)
align with him like I used to do this I (103:16 - 103:20)
would sit at home and spend all this (103:19 - 103:23)
money and that was an unhealthy habit (103:20 - 103:26)
and does not talk about the downfall of (103:23 - 103:28)
everything else that's affected through (103:26 - 103:30)
the web of when you've hyper focus on (103:28 - 103:31)
that one thing and that's the thing that (103:30 - 103:33)
you're correcting (103:31 - 103:34)
um (103:33 - 103:36)
and again it's like yeah you created the (103:34 - 103:39)
problem you are somewhat required to fix (103:36 - 103:41)
it but also (103:39 - 103:45)
you are fixing it in a way that tends to (103:41 - 103:48)
benefit your company the most and not (103:45 - 103:50)
your consumers the most again a lot of (103:48 - 103:52)
these decisions while they are fixing (103:50 - 103:54)
their problem are they're fixing them in (103:52 - 103:57)
a corporate forward first Manner and I (103:54 - 104:01)
think that is a part of where all (103:57 - 104:03)
corporations do this I think is a is a (104:01 - 104:05)
very frustrating thing do sort of have (104:03 - 104:07)
to deal with when you're dealing with a (104:05 - 104:09)
corporation that needs to make money (104:07 - 104:12)
most of their decisions are going to (104:09 - 104:13)
come (104:12 - 104:16)
as corporate first and they Sort of hope (104:13 - 104:18)
that it's enough of a consumer benefit (104:16 - 104:21)
that people don't get mad and it's (104:18 - 104:23)
interesting because they are in the (104:21 - 104:25)
Specialties also saying we are hoping to (104:23 - 104:28)
release a flurry of other things that (104:25 - 104:30)
get you excited that you will stop (104:28 - 104:34)
caring about how mad you are about this (104:30 - 104:36)
I mean it's sort of the underlying (104:34 - 104:39)
message is we're doing so many grapes in (104:36 - 104:41)
the games that that you will not care (104:39 - 104:44)
about the thing that we can't we have to (104:41 - 104:46)
admit is terrible for a lot of people (104:44 - 104:49)
hopefully we'll do so many of the things (104:46 - 104:51)
that it will be a drop in the bucket (104:49 - 104:53)
compared to the value you think you're (104:51 - 104:55)
getting out of our game going forward (104:53 - 104:58)
do you think though that there is some (104:55 - 105:01)
truth to that if (104:58 - 105:03)
um (105:01 - 105:05)
so if you're if you're like sitting in a (105:03 - 105:08)
Discord all day and you're spending (105:05 - 105:10)
10 bucks a day like slamming remote (105:08 - 105:14)
raids because that is the fun thing to (105:10 - 105:16)
you whether that's chasing a shiny or (105:14 - 105:18)
chasing a hundred percent or chasing 100 (105:16 - 105:20)
shiny (105:18 - 105:22)
you know who you are not me I'll tell (105:20 - 105:24)
you that much but do you think if they (105:22 - 105:25)
add (105:24 - 105:29)
other gameplay features that are (105:25 - 105:30)
exciting (105:29 - 105:33)
you it would almost like resp (105:30 - 105:34)
um I'm thinking pot it would like (105:33 - 105:37)
re-sparkle Joy because I think to I (105:34 - 105:39)
think there was excitement around team (105:37 - 105:42)
go rocket when it first came out and (105:39 - 105:43)
people were like oh my gosh and they (105:42 - 105:44)
went out and they were like I want to (105:43 - 105:45)
battle as much team go rocket I want to (105:44 - 105:47)
collect the Shadow Pokemon like none of (105:45 - 105:48)
that was remote raid pass like that was (105:47 - 105:50)
like literally pay money to never see a (105:48 - 105:54)
team I'm with you I'm with you Greg 100 (105:50 - 105:56)
from going from like level 44 to 45 or (105:54 - 105:59)
whatever it was or 45 to 46 you have to (105:56 - 106:02)
like battle like seven million team I (105:59 - 106:04)
never want to see him team go rocket (106:02 - 106:07)
again but like (106:04 - 106:07)
I also don't want the game to just be (106:08 - 106:13)
I'm just gonna spend a dollar and do (106:14 - 106:17)
raids until I get a shiny and then cool (106:15 - 106:20)
next week uh there's a new cool tapu (106:17 - 106:21)
bulu coming all right I'm just gonna (106:20 - 106:23)
spend dollars until that one's shiny (106:21 - 106:25)
okay after that top of Coco coming I'm (106:23 - 106:27)
gonna SP I don't want the game to be (106:25 - 106:29)
that yeah I mean they do have a problem (106:27 - 106:30)
that they need to figure out what (106:29 - 106:32)
they're doing with their game to (106:30 - 106:33)
reignite (106:32 - 106:36)
the the fan base because we are seven (106:33 - 106:39)
years in and it is not an exciting game (106:36 - 106:40)
to play (106:39 - 106:44)
um so like I get they are stuck in they (106:40 - 106:47)
are stuck in a very hard place because (106:44 - 106:51)
their game isn't aging well and people (106:47 - 106:55)
no longer see the value of playing your (106:51 - 106:57)
game they seem much more value in (106:55 - 106:59)
shortcutting your game and that is a (106:57 - 107:02)
problem for a lot of games (106:59 - 107:05)
um but there are ways to sort of do that (107:02 - 107:08)
better like MMOs deal with this all the (107:05 - 107:11)
time they have to do an expansion every (107:08 - 107:13)
so years to reinvigorate the game and (107:11 - 107:16)
raise level caps and to help people get (107:13 - 107:18)
to that point you know you can pay money (107:16 - 107:20)
to skip levels like there these things (107:18 - 107:22)
exist to re (107:20 - 107:26)
to reinvigorate the game and I think (107:22 - 107:29)
the issue that we're having here is we (107:26 - 107:32)
are in a bad holding pattern (107:29 - 107:34)
and (107:32 - 107:36)
they don't have an expansion to really (107:34 - 107:38)
announce right like the big expansion (107:36 - 107:40)
right now is Shadow raids and we're all (107:38 - 107:42)
rates on the master ball I feel like are (107:40 - 107:45)
things they're really maybe excited to (107:42 - 107:46)
announce and I'm not sure if they're (107:45 - 107:48)
being received the way that (107:46 - 107:51)
want them to be I don't I don't think so (107:48 - 107:53)
because (107:51 - 107:56)
Shadow raids aren't are still raids and (107:53 - 107:59)
raids aren't particularly fun to do and (107:56 - 108:01)
you still have to battle the team go (107:59 - 108:03)
rocket to get the shards to get the (108:01 - 108:06)
purified the raids and you know it's (108:03 - 108:08)
relying on things that have existed for (108:06 - 108:10)
a while that people are already over and (108:08 - 108:13)
not enthused by So when you say hey (108:10 - 108:15)
we're bringing in Shadow raids you're (108:13 - 108:18)
like okay well you had me at Shadow you (108:15 - 108:20)
lost me at raid yeah it goes back to (108:18 - 108:22)
like when they first introduced megas (108:20 - 108:25)
and it was like oh these are just raids (108:22 - 108:27)
and I have to do like three of them or (108:25 - 108:29)
four of them to get enough energy to do (108:27 - 108:32)
the mega to then do more like (108:29 - 108:36)
for them being like we don't want you to (108:32 - 108:39)
sit in your Discord and remote raid all (108:36 - 108:40)
day we would like you to go out we would (108:39 - 108:42)
like you to leave we would like you to (108:40 - 108:45)
play the game that we want to be walking (108:42 - 108:49)
based I get that but also you just keep (108:45 - 108:52)
giving us raid content like at the very (108:49 - 108:54)
least give us a start raid button so (108:52 - 108:56)
they don't take quite as long and we can (108:54 - 108:57)
get back to walking (108:56 - 108:59)
like (108:57 - 109:03)
at least at the fundamental base level (108:59 - 109:07)
team go rocket was (109:03 - 109:09)
they appear at pokestops and when you're (109:07 - 109:11)
walking through the park three of them (109:09 - 109:13)
will pop up and you can stop what you're (109:11 - 109:15)
doing and you can battle them and that's (109:13 - 109:17)
different than just sitting there and (109:15 - 109:20)
catching (109:17 - 109:22)
but it just and like everyone's mad at (109:20 - 109:25)
raids understandable prices went up (109:22 - 109:27)
limit is there (109:25 - 109:30)
totally get it but then all of your (109:27 - 109:31)
content (109:30 - 109:34)
is still raid-based (109:31 - 109:38)
it's still around raids and so it's like (109:34 - 109:40)
we have new and exciting stuff (109:38 - 109:44)
is it more like rape stuff because like (109:40 - 109:46)
that's not new and exciting like well (109:44 - 109:48)
and the problem is is like oh and we're (109:46 - 109:50)
leading into the stuff that you're that (109:48 - 109:52)
you're mad about for the passes like (109:50 - 109:55)
we're doing bahraines which sort of just (109:52 - 109:58)
keeps pushing a button on the raid pass (109:55 - 110:00)
issue like (109:58 - 110:03)
do something else you I think like the (110:00 - 110:06)
costume stuff is supposed to like that's (110:03 - 110:08)
rumored right like the yeah costume show (110:06 - 110:10)
or whatever which is like I don't know (110:08 - 110:12)
if that's gonna like like I guess like (110:10 - 110:15)
there there is the body system like that (110:12 - 110:19)
is not raid not Team Rocket not catching (110:15 - 110:21)
um I mean they have introduced really (110:19 - 110:22)
cool stuff in the last year that's not (110:21 - 110:24)
red based they did Vivion they did (110:22 - 110:26)
kecleon (110:24 - 110:29)
all of those things gimme ghoul they (110:26 - 110:30)
brought in a lot of really cool Pokemon (110:29 - 110:32)
that you can get you just don't see them (110:30 - 110:34)
very often so that was those were all (110:32 - 110:37)
each a little fun burst of this is good (110:34 - 110:38)
for the game you're right the Vivion (110:37 - 110:40)
stuff was really good (110:38 - 110:43)
yeah and kecleon was really exciting (110:40 - 110:46)
when it was finally announced and you (110:43 - 110:47)
just can't find them anymore and you (110:46 - 110:49)
need them for the Masterwork but yeah I (110:47 - 110:53)
need I need four more that sucks (110:49 - 110:53)
all the big things yeah are raid-based (110:55 - 111:04)
and it's okay to have like (111:00 - 111:04)
I I don't I I I think it's hard for me (111:04 - 111:08)
to be like (111:06 - 111:10)
this team go rocket stuff maybe there (111:08 - 111:12)
are some people that are not jaded or (111:10 - 111:15)
burnt out from team go rocket I still (111:12 - 111:18)
want my hair hero badge (111:15 - 111:21)
I don't hate it I'm past that level (111:18 - 111:24)
where I had to do an immeasurable number (111:21 - 111:26)
of team go rocket battles and I still do (111:24 - 111:27)
them (111:26 - 111:31)
um but it's not exciting exactly yeah if (111:27 - 111:34)
if like I I have no problem with like (111:31 - 111:36)
Mewtwo being in raids as like a shadow (111:34 - 111:38)
Pokemon I think that's cool I'm not (111:36 - 111:40)
saying me too shouldn't be there but (111:38 - 111:41)
like (111:40 - 111:43)
if your new event is (111:41 - 111:46)
we revamped team go rocket but not (111:43 - 111:50)
really they're just in raids that I I (111:46 - 111:52)
would gosh I would just like to see (111:50 - 111:56)
teamer go rocket be different yeah (111:52 - 111:56)
yeah make a Team Plasma I don't know (111:57 - 112:03)
just something that isn't (111:59 - 112:05)
but that that's its own problem (112:03 - 112:08)
um like the the battle system is is an (112:05 - 112:11)
as too intuitive or as not intuitive as (112:08 - 112:13)
you want to make it out to be I mean (112:11 - 112:14)
they're changing the battle system a (112:13 - 112:17)
little bit with this whole shard (112:14 - 112:19)
purified gem thing and I think that (112:17 - 112:21)
that's supposed to (112:19 - 112:23)
be a little boost there and it does seem (112:21 - 112:25)
interesting it's just you have to do the (112:23 - 112:27)
team go rocket battles to get those (112:25 - 112:28)
things (112:27 - 112:31)
like I said this is putting two features (112:28 - 112:33)
that people aren't super psyched about (112:31 - 112:34)
together (112:33 - 112:36)
and I'm not sure it's going to generate (112:34 - 112:39)
hype yeah (112:36 - 112:39)
yeah (112:40 - 112:44)
well I think that's uh that's our show (112:41 - 112:48)
one one quick update oh yeah dashing and (112:44 - 112:49)
