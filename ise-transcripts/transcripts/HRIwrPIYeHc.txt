[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 450 458th episode of the pokemon podcast it's super effective a super effective 25th anniversary to you and my co-host i am your host svj and uh with me is will i do you ever have this experience where you are taking apart your desk so you can move it to your new house and you put the screws for the different sections of the desk in each of your different pockets of your jeans and then you take the screwdriver that you're using to take apart the desk and you put it in your back pocket of your jeans so you're like i'm going to have that screwdriver when i need to put this desk back together and then for some reason you go in the kitchen and you put the screwdriver in the drawer because you need to take apart a chair and you think that the tool for the chair is in there and it's not and anyways that you don't take the chair apart and then you take the chair and the desk pieces to your car and then you say but wait the screwdriver is in that kitchen drawer i got to go back and get the screwdriver so you go back and you grab two boxes of clothes and put them in your car and drive to your new house and you get your new house and you try to put your desk together and there's no screwdriver it's in the drawer correct is the trick question i'm good at these escape room things so okay so now put the letter a and z on this area in the map that's going to open up a secret compartment and inside will be 25th anniversary news wow i don't like the 20th anniversary why don't you like escape rooms because it's always one person in control it is not yeah it's you yeah i mean okay captain control would take over so the real escape room will be whether this hand-assembled desk is going to stay together throughout this recording or if it collapses on you uh greg is here i am here i am in a room that i'm not escaping from right now no matter how much i might want to people noticed your new bookshelf last time new bookshelf i i'm slowly adding things all over it's going to be a hunt to see what new things i've added as i rearrange the many rooms in my house i know that i have to work here on a permanent basis the same uh alola special edition gift set dealie i moved that over i have that too i'll have to put it up in the background i finally remembered a where i put it which was on a stupid shelf and b i'm like oh this actually kind of looks good as a piece of decoration i'll put it up uh speaking of putting up we have uh to put up with the lack of 25th anniversary news that was actually one of your better transitions and i'm gonna actually say i mean it wasn't great but it was one of the better ones it was all right some we do have some pokemon there was another pokemon snap trailer uh it was just like one of the shorter probably for tv ones 30 seconds a minute i didn't watch it i heard there's a new mythical i don't know what it is it's no spoiler like like outside i know that's celebrities before no not like never endeavor brand new introducing snap there's a new snap mythical i mean it happened it's just a camera that volcanion is attached to magnetically and he's very confused why is he because i feel like volcanion is just happy to be noticed i was just gonna say that he's happy with the attention he's the worst mythical right no no no no metal exists oh wait a minute now delta mail metal are our top tier they're they're they're sweet pokemon top tier the losers bracket you're gonna put volcanion over mel metal yeah volcanion has four nostrils what does male metal have one big eye thing it's got wires in its butt i'll give it that it does have wires in its butt that's true warrior booty i would say the one that came out with volcanion doesn't even have a story doesn't have at does this nothing magina is just nothing mcgaren is pretty bad how many uh how many are there too let's many culling the mythicals cutting them back uh all right who is your number one mythical best mythical i mean the best mythical right is up there super super great i put probably victini in top three you know what mine is actually which is weird mew no it's it's i i know i know oh there's dust here uh uh i thought it was a fly uh mellow winner no oh jeez martial's good our shadow is actually probably i think my favorite mythical currently melody has like the figure of like a roselia has some music you like to sing yeah don't stereotype dude yeah it's two on the nose i feel like everybody's been like oh you're a mellowetta boy and i'm like i have more facets not many i traded you a melody i know diancie's a a mythical right yeah but dancing is cool because dancing's like it's a carbine but it's a special carving yeah i like dancing well i mean volcanion is not great my geared at bottom bottom level the thing that makes volcanion cool is it was like i'm gonna say it this way it's gonna sound weird but you're gonna understand what i'm trying to say it was like six years ago we went through this list of hey they went in the code and found all of these pokemon that are gonna come out and then it's like six years later they're like hey remember we all found that code for volcanion remember here's your volcano it's tacked out at the end i was like but six years ago it sounded really cool we're gonna have a fire water pokemon and it's like not cool anymore i want to like zarud i just have no basis for zurude liking your hatred because the movie isn't even around yet at least not here is it out in japan when did that movie come out it came out of japan it came out on christmas for them why don't we have it you know uh they they're they're giving us so much 25th anniversary just haven't finished the movie and say this is the 25th anniversary movie and it would be something they just haven't gotten they don't want to overwhelm us you know to be fair we're good yeah to be fair we're getting a a pokemon game in five days game uh speaking of that pokemon game uh transitioned into some news here fujifilm launches a new app for the insta mini link now there's some confusion here so fujifilm yeah has a product called the insta instix insta it's insta then there's an x at the end i don't know if you're supposed to pronounce the x uh instax let's say in stacks i think it's just insta mini i think the x is just bad brains actually keep them getting sued by instagram yeah so they are releasing a pikachu version of this is it a version or is it a case it's a case technically it's a version how is it technically a version because the thing inside is the same old thing it is it's really dumb wow but you can say the same thing about the pikachu switch controller it's still the same switch controller on the inside but it's just got a cool pikachu graphic on it yeah okay so the printer itself doesn't have a graphic on it it's just the printer look so this was sent in by stuart this is off uh fujifilm's website if you what we need to back up the insta mini link is a polaroid printer not a camera wait no it's not a polaroid because that would be made by polaroids okay what do they call those photo printer it's a photo printer it's a photo printer but they look like polaroids how about that they look like polaroids it doesn't look like polarized they just have a big bar across them yeah they have they have the blank bar at the bottom yeah okay they do they have the blank bar at the bottom so it is a polaroid printer polaroid-esque printer a polaroid-esque printer or taken down here by the polaroid company which i'm pretty sure is still a valid concern i don't think polaroid's doing well at all right now right now doesn't matter a bunch of i bought their printable i bought their new polaroid camera slash printer for my wedding so people could take pictures and print them out that was like 10 years ago that was not 10 years because it's 2014. and they're just gonna sue us for watering down their name that's how they do it i still have it i can dig it out here somewhere and i put it in this house so the insta mini link insta mini what is this called instagram smartphone printer uh it is just a printer it doesn't take pictures this is very hard on an audio podcast so they announced a special bundle uh which is an insta mini link white red and blue so that's what's exclusive the printer itself is mostly white and it has like a blue it has a little bit of blue and a little bit of red so there's your exclusivity because some of these printers are green or pink or purple we can get to that point and then it comes with a silicone case featuring pikachu and then on the like product box they have you know pokemon snap and animal crossing and some mario stuff and then there's a big like works with the nintendo switch so what fujifilm is doing is they're releasing a smartphone app called insta for a nintendo switch that you'll be able to download and then you can take the pictures that you take on your switch and then you can use that qr code thing that we talked about last week and you can send it to this app and then the app will send it to the printer and the printer will print your photos regardless of what game they are you can print your hades photos if you want to or your animal crossing photos ring fit photos that i accidentally take all the time um so that's all it is and that is the the the app is coming out on april 30th and then the in japan the silicone case featuring pikachu bundle red and blue instant mini link printer is coming out on april 30th and i believe unless something has changed in the last two days of be reading a different website the the pikachu one is coming to the united states in may but japan will get it this week now that being said the insta mini printer has existed since 2019 and you can just walk into a store and buy one right now i think they're like 99 bucks or something have you ever seen one on the shelves of any store ever yeah target has them yeah target has them i've never target has like a whole aisle of like knockoff guard garbage electronics that i have no interest in i don't go to the electronics section and target i'm gonna say this dusky pink printer though it's really good how much uh well target says is 99.99 but okay target actually has this color in stock i'm just on the print website they may let's look you know i i i do think that this is going to sell out because everything pokemon related is selling out yes but also this this is not worthy to sit next to the ancient mew or the the burger king and the reason i say that is because if we look at the game boy printer it's not hard to find a used game boy printer i think it's actually harder to find the best game boy printer in my house i think it's harder to find the the printer paper for the game boy printer than it is the game boy printer did it use like thermal print or what did it do hey the pink one's in stock at my one of my local targets i could buy it for 99.99 i was just gonna say that the view from my new office is mostly home depot but a little bit target so i mean if you need me to just get up and run over there and take me about 15 minutes can you uh keep us updated on the price of number over there people like this product they're also leaving out that you have to buy the film packs for it oh yeah i already looked those up it was about 12.99 for 20 sheets on amazon which is like 78 cents a sheet i think here's the real thing i'm if i can buy the pikachu one i will buy the pikachu one i'm not going to settle for any 2019 versions i just want the silicone case i want and i want the silicone case and the pink printer this this white red no nixon match sorry no mix and match i'm sure i can find i don't think they're gonna sell the silicone case separately they might you never know that's not how you make money yeah it is that's how you get how you make money a special edition on the side of a box and sell a product from 2019 that they probably already made a long time ago and they were like how do we put these on shelves let's throw a case in the box there ain't no nothing special about white red and blue unless you want to be like america i'm just gonna say or any other country do you know what's actually probably a better use of your money is just send your photos to walgreens how much is a print at walgreens it's like 12 cents can i send my qr code to walgreens though yeah like it's it's so much cheaper the point of this printer is you carry it with you so that whether you're when you're with your friends you take snap a photo and then you print it and you're like hey friends remember that picnic we're at right now here's a photo of it if you have that it allows you to add backgrounds and stickers and stuff that you can't add to your walgreens i learned anything from ultrasound ultramoon it's putting stickers on photos is something that other people enjoy doing no one is walking around with a nintendo switch and a printer in their backpack the printer is versatile it's not just for the switch why do you think it has a silicon case so you can throw it in your bag right it is not just for the switch you could use probably one of the insta camera things and take a picture and link it there greg and i take photos together all the time they're very kawaii and we will put stickers on them that are like little hearts and like besto friendos it's 23 cents to make a picture print at walgreens 23 cents how much did you say the the the thing was 78 cents but no much difference for the convenience of having your own stickers in your app and printing it in your own home you captain i don't want to leave to have somebody else do my stuff are all about this printer life and also not having to go into a walgreens because i for as much as i hate cvs walgreens is probably for the lowest level pictures at walgreens or cvs is actually the easiest thing ever so is filling up your tires at a gas station yet you went and bought an air compressor for your car i did one number one milwaukee charges for air you could charge for printing at walgreens you get charged for air number two is not only did i fill my tires i filled irene's tires and i got a new snow blower which i needed to fill their tires that device is paying for itself greg and you can have multiple friends at an event all printing off of your one printer no without having to make a trip to an audio friends because you'll be thinking look at how much money i'm losing because it's it's 78 cents a sheet you know because i can't put you put a price on joy you cannot put a price on joy i'm sure when this printer comes out it's going to go from 78 cents a sheet to like four dollars a sheet because all the scalpers are gonna buy out now buy it now that is your pro play you go to every target in your area buy all the sheets and throw it up on ebay and who cares about pokemon cards anymore you have maximized the insta max printer link market no this is what's going to happen people are gonna they wanna feel the nostalgia right they wanna they want that they want that feeling of blockbuster they're gonna go out buy this printer that has existed for two years that they've had no interest in for the last two years they're gonna buy this printer they're gonna buy a bunch of paper they're going to do it like twice on april 30th and may 1st and then they're it's just going to cut they're never going to touch it again because if they actually cared about a printable portable printable insta thing it's existed the product has been here it's existed before 2019 they just update it that's false because the whole reason i'm getting this is to print out all the photos i'm taking in pokemon snap which is a game gate based around taking photos but you can send them to walgreens and not spend a lot of time i don't go to walmart my picture though you can send them to cbs walgreens try to find a cvs in minnesota buddy that's not the one up the street but here's the thing can you send pictures from this wonderful app that gives you so many options to walgreens i think the answer is no well and walgreens doesn't let you put stickers on yeah you put the stickers on in the pokemon snap app but there are other ones in the smartlink app where am i going to get those where am i going to get those from where am i going to get this incredible mario face background to put on my selfie if i don't have this printer has like filters too doesn't it where it's like it can make me have kitty cat ears and stuff that's very important i want to buy the dumb printer don't get me wrong not don't say i don't want to you are going to buy the dollar there's definitely my instagram story to come out i will only pay msrp for the dumb printer not a dollar more whatever they don't have the price for what the pikachu version is going to be i would assume maybe like 120 if the normal one is 100 130 probably that silicon case is worthwhile yeah silicon case is legit probably get exclusive pokemon stickers but but let's be honest there is no one listing the show that is that is going to use this printer more than like four times and if they do it's only to spite me and the show to be like look i used it for a fifth time good and then the fifth time then they throw it in the closet next to the burger king gold coins where it will get money but the thing is you can use this like at parties if you could you could but we're talking about a game that we all think that is going to maybe be like one week or two weeks of enjoyment but the printer is is independent of reversal you you've already lived two plus years without the printer in your life because i didn't even know it existed i didn't know i needed it until now and now with all my parties that will happen soon sure how many times take pictures have greg and i done pokemon go community day and i wish we had a nice photograph i could put in a frame to commemorate the time that we spent together i did not know this printer existed and now that i know it's there i will have my desk will be covered in photos of me and greg think of how great canto day would have been if we were printing out pictures that entire time i know deep down inside you both hate this printer you're just playing devil's advocate right now i don't hate it i i just think you also don't have enough young people in your life because the teenagers in here boomer need to put stuff up in their lockers and they need to put pictures of their best friends with stickers that say aren't we cute and i have this entire blank closet door that could be covered in pictures right now and it's not because i never had the printer fair speaking of uh things that america will never get a pokemon themed fossil exhibit is opening in japan i want to go to this thing so bad let's go uh this is a uh kotaku let's cancel our our may travel plans and go to japan instead we have travel plans yes yes uh this was sent in by spencer from our slack community uh it will open this summer in japan according to the official announcement the expedition will let visitors observe and compare fossils from dinosaurs and other creatures as well as extinct plants and with pocket monsters with the ideal of hopefully showing how enjoyable paleontology is did i get that right close enough paleontology pale ale i'm reading this topology that's that that's the study of dinosaurs right this is the study of dinosaurs yes you're just saying it a little weird you're saying it a little weird do you know speaking of dinosaurs this is a side note i was playing uh jack box with some this was pretty pandemic i'll never forget the moment though because i was super salty am i allowed to express yes uh what's the game where they're like uh you gotta it's a quiz show but then they cut off your fingers and then they like stab your dolls oh oh my gosh i play that all the time burner mystery party yeah murder so we're playing murder mystery party and the question came up of like which dinosaur is not real and the answer is the the the long neck one the the brontosaurus brontosaurus from jurassic park right like that's not a real dinosaur well bronissary is from what we thought was real in science like jurassic park didn't invent the brontosaurus we thought the brontosaurus was a thing for a very long time right right but in jurassic park that was a rad dinosaur you're like check that it's like a giraffe and a thing and it's big um they have a couple in the flintstones i think it's an alias or now is it wait yeah it got converted to a different they got converted into a different thing but i knew that wasn't a real dinosaur and there was like i don't know seven or seven or eight of us in the room and i was the only one that got it right and the audacity of the people in this room being like did you actually know that steve or did you just lucky guess no i knew that wasn't a real dinosaur because i know my dinosaurs jeez i was i was legit that ruined my night it legit ruined my night i was so mad i mean to be fair nine times out of ten the answer that you give is yeah i guessed so the odds were stacked against you you don't have a lot to be angry about since most of the time you are flying by the city of your pants look i'm pretty dumb that's the point but i know your dinosaurs knew the answer to the dinosaur question and i i'm salty about it still still it's been like what a year and a half something like that god this is like the movie the grudge although brontosaurus is a real dinosaur i think you're thinking of the wrong one brachiosaurus or whatever i don't know the one with the long neck i don't bro that's brontosaurus is the one with the long neck it's a real dinosaur i'm looking it up right now because i was like i'm trying to find what the real name is and then it's like it's it's the long neck dinosaur jurassic park that's not a real dinosaur it is a real dinosaur i'm literally looking at it right now greg verified dinosaur knowledge i gotta finish this article uh okay so here is the answer it was believed to not be real and then they have now since proven that it was right exactly wait what the fried thesaurus is back is officially reclaimed that's what it is no no no pluto is never going to be a planet again keeps flipping no it doesn't wait so when did mystery murder party come out a long time ago that was like 2013 or something right yeah and it wasn't until 2015 that it was brought back as being a dinosaur interesting i'd be curious what the other three answers were wow i don't remember the other three differences we found between the brontosaurus and the apatosaurosaurus at least as numerous as the ones between other closely related dinosaurs uh and much more than you would normally find in a species so they thought it was just a variant but now they have seen that there is enough differences that they can reclassify it as its own brontosaurus this happened late 2015 it was lost in the news okay but when did they decide it wasn't a dinosaur but the thunder lose the thunder lizard has been proven to be species in its own right oh this is the problem steve hates the word so pluto was declassified in 2006 and it looks like rinosaurus was declassified in 2006 i'm trying to fight okay exact date so it took him a while to prove that the brontosaurus is real so guess what salty man you can no longer be salty because time has proven you wrong yet again hey i was the only one in the room that got that question right i could only imagine what the other people guessed that's why i'm curious what the other three dinosaurs where i don't remember the dinosaurs or pokemon the museum the pokemon fossil museum will kick off this july in uh me hold on i'm gonna get this mikasa city museum in hokkaido uh before wrapping up there in september and moving to the shi main prefecture tokyo in aci other locations will be added before the exhibit ends its run in summer of 2023 so you got plenty of time mall of america listed on there so they need to get out we got plenty of time to check out the dinosaurs and i'm sure i am sure these museums will carry pikachu merch with pikachu wearing a hard hat or something and a pickaxe but just like uh the world championships had that as the mascot maybe they were just sitting on those two big statues they built for the world championships and they're like we need to get some more revenue out of these two bad boys ship them to japan throw them in a museum all right let's uh take a break we got some more pokemon news there were some past events we should talk about and then maybe yeah the 20th anniversary there's we will be right back [Music] a dynamic [Music] that is [Music] dynamics [Music] we are back from our break hello uh before i forget before i forget uh throughout the entire month of april pod chaser is donating 25 cents to meals on wheels did i get that right the first time yes yep uh for every review you leave and i think we're just shy

and then on may 1st i'm not 100 happy it's a saturday but we're going to be relaunching the entire patreon so we're gonna be doing uh redoing all the rewards we're gonna be adding new rewards we're gonna get rid of rewards that people don't care about uh it'll be great it'll be exciting this is the biggest re this is the biggest revamp i've ever done uh in the past we've like slowly changed some rewards we've added a new tier got rid of a tier but we're redoing it all it's all getting redone so that'll be on may 1st i don't love launching things on a weekend because i feel like people aren't in front of their computers on a weekend but i don't want to do it people do stuff with their phones they don't do stuff with their computers anymore they'll be in front of their phones yeah but when they're in front of their computer for work they're looking for things not to do at work so send out a reminder on monday yes or tuesday yeah i will send a reminder but i don't want to i don't want to do it before may 1st because then people if people want to sign up then they get charged twice they'll get charged on like april 29th and then they'll get charged on may 1st so i just want to be considerate of hold your money until may 1st if you're considering signing up for the page if you're on the edge wait until the good stuff comes in um but that'll that'll be may 1st i'm very excited for the launch of that and then yeah i'll probably send out an email on the third that's monday yes yes yeah okay now with that out of the way the housekeeping out of the way uh there was a max raid battle weekend in pokemon sword and shield this weekend uh it was yeah of course penguins are fantastic world penguin day is april 25th that's what they say here nobody loves penguins as much as i do i wanted a penguin as a kid i had a whole plan for how i would keep a penguin as a pet because i fundamentally didn't understand how penguins worked but i had a plan like there's a bathroom i could take over i had a whole thing i read a bunch of penguin books my parents were very against the idea i was a penguin as a kid wow you ever hear of chilly willy if not look it up kids because that was me the penguin yes that was me that was me he's chilly i did i got a shiny penguin i got congrats i already had a shiny penguin but i got another one you had two wow i was expecting you to say what you always say is i did a bunch and i didn't get any well now you can evolve one of them uh a wonderful listener who is in a time zone far in the future helped me get the first one and then friday night i think it was friday i randomly joined one on the y-com and it was shiny i'm like nice was the whole cash percentages and everything the same where it's like if you were hosting the raid you had you were guaranteed but if you weren't it was like 10 or something well i think with ice cube because it's based off species catch rate i think ice cube is like 22 or something but if you ultra ball it's like 44 and then if you repeat ball it's pretty much 100 close to 100 i mean it's all repeat balls what like times five i think times four times five so i repeat bald mine because i was a guest yeah i that that existed i as much as i like these raid weekends the same thing i'm a broken record they do a really bad job at promoting them and letting people know and the lack of heads up is a bummer and the thing they always do there was a pogo event this past weekend there was this event there was the players cup what was last weekend oh nothing like they spread it out i don't well they don't have control over world penguin day that okay that you're right true that's true they don't have control over earth day these were set by the world governments okay friendship hour was made up by niantic yeah well uh fyi will i found a funko chili willy with a stack of pancakes with pancakes yes pancakes for you to remember your childhood speaking of the friendship hour friendship day was that was supposed to be saturday it was this was the grass one that was that was yesterday yeah that was it yeah so you guys didn't do it is what i'm at uh hi i'm trying to move so i dropped i dropped things off to help will move okay then we went furniture shopping that's true friendship that would be the front of our shop and then uh we took a risk and we went and ate out of five guys indoors a surreal experience because it's been literally a year since i've eaten inside a restaurant did they not have outdoor seating it was cold oh you and i went to a restaurant we went to a restaurant uh and then we went furniture shopping and i did do some uh grass pokemon catching but not a ton and i didn't get anything shiny there was there was supposed to be uh a new pokemon that was quote unquote nearby and i i was like you're this point you're saying nearby i'm literally on top of it and this isn't spawning so i'm out it was uh i'm bummed you guys didn't do it because it was really easy it took me about 20 minutes to finish the challenge it was one of those catch challenges um so it had i think it had like eight or ten grass pokemon you had to catch it was like the grass starters and fungus and shroomish and uh sun kern and stuff uh i went to the park i normally went to which was bit like the park has a huge parking lot it's a very big park i don't know i don't know if either of you have been to it but i don't know i've never been to any parks you know anywhere nice well i the only park in milwaukee i've ever been to is where the that little stream goes like the entire length until it ends at a golf course uh dag-nabbit what is the name of that stream oh well i mean i know the park's near me but i'm not going to dox myself [Laughter] not until you're ready to move um so when i went to elm grove park it was they had 300 soccer games going they had kids climbing in trees i don't know they were attaching little belts to them and pulling them up trees it was wild i was like what is happening here right now no it's like pull you know pole climbing like lumberjack pole climbing oh yeah yeah yeah they had like one of those light fixing structures and they had kids climbing a tree it was really i don't know what light fix what is that light fixing it's like the orange thing with the big arm and there's a basket at the top like a cherry crane yeah like a crane well no crane is like holding stuff it's like the basket with the arm a crane no that he's he's literally talking about a cherry picker yeah it's like a cherry picker no no it is a cherry picker okay like for the red cherry when the electric company comes out and fixes the telephone pole that's a cherry picker that's the official name for it oh they were cherry-picking five-year-olds up a tree it was the park was out of control it was very busy so i went to like the scenic route where it was not busy but anyways i completed the catch friendship challenge whatever with no friends you did it all by yourself it's true you didn't need friends to complete it it it awarded a hundred and seventy five thousand xp and then if you had a lucky egg on it was 350 000 xp which you know i'm it's a lot curious of all the people that were complaining about not being level 40 from you went the extra mile to do this because it was pretty easy a lot of xp for little to no work um i found a a shiny alolan exeggutor that was pretty cool nice uh i i checked like the self-rodent stuff i don't think uh any grass-type pokemon was boosted shiny odds uh there was three times catch bonus so if you were playing during the hour obviously having a lucky egg wouldn't increase that and then there they increased trade distance by 40 kilometers which i don't know what that is in american and then your incense lasted your lures lasted and you had a higher chance of getting lucky pokemon if you completed trade with a friend 24 miles i don't have any friends so i had a pretty good time though i played 90 minutes of the three hours and i walked like four miles so that was pretty good it was an alright event prior to this event although we haven't talked about we didn't talk about this last week but like the two days before this event the lucky egg stuff was like slightly broken where is if you use the lucky egg and you opened a present from a friend to get the friendship xp it wasn't working for some people not all people it seemed to be like not widespread but obviously the people it happened to they were very vocal and angry so they were very loud of course and i get it right you know you're supposed to get a hundred thousand x 200 000 xp you only get 100 000 xp it was you know it cost 80 cents to turn on a lucky egg totally understand the complaints the other thing though is team rocket was missing for two weeks i don't know if you all noticed yes i was supposed to be fighting giovanni and i'm like scared of me there's no balloon he's so too afraid of what i can do right before friendship day uh they were they fixed the lucky egg so that's working now again and then team rocket's back so i'm not sure what weird issue broke team rocket i don't even know why team rocket broke in the first place like i don't know what went wrong i just remember them getting pulled they were too annoying not wrong uh but niantic fixed both before this event so that was good but again i don't think i don't think niantic would ever say why it broke or even maybe they even know what caused it or if the pokemon like the pokemon company is very good at being like there's an issue we just keep on pushing forward we're not going to acknowledge that although i think in like harry potter wizards unite i feel like they can't i don't know i thought i felt like rocket balloons left there too no i felt like there was an issue like that rocket i thought i remember reading there was an issue in harry potter and they kind of explained what went wrong and kind of elaborated on it but they will never do that with pokemon go no i mean somebody leaned on the button that turned off the shinies and turned off from team rocket because it is just a button at this point they have that fine of control it's it's interesting to think about you know this game being almost five years old and being like i i know this from working on websites at least which a website is probably less complicated than a mobile app that exists between two platforms on various phones and various os's i don't know how many versions of android it's running on or how many versions of ios or how android works on a google phone versus samsung versus how it huawei huawei is that what that one is what uh what the but when i was fixing websites when i had a real job back in the day and you would go in and you would see like six years of a website and how everything was like band-aid on top of each other and and the boss would be like i want you to do this and you're like uh but if we do this this will break this will break this will break and this will break um so we're gonna have to like fix those first before we do what you wanted to do i'm curious of how much at this point pokemon go is held together with band-aids it's band-aids all the way down no oh had rigorous control over their code base said no one ever i just said it [Laughter] they literally had one person working on the code and then they exploded and now there's like yeah that's a team of 50 who just keeps adding code on top of code like i'm like they added the same [ __ ] and killed team rocket the game shipped in a working state that's debatable because it crashed a lot five years ago yeah five years ago and they had server problems so i don't think that was necessarily the game it was you know connecting the server and that's right it was the server's fault and then they they that the tip is rapidly dropping server and then they had to they had to hire a bunch of people and at least with the pandemic they had to pivot and make remote raid passes work and squeeze out well who knows how long the evolution was in that stuff or hey whatever happened to those sponsored balloons do we talk about those i see them every once in a while but all balloons disappeared during yeah yeah i haven't seen those sponsored balloons since team rocket came back i this is not defending niantic but i am sure their app is held together with band-aids at this point everything is held together right this podcast is held together with band-aids yeah so i'd be curiou i'd be curious if people would be okay well no one would be okay with anything like if niantic came out and said we're not adding any new features for three months but we are going to work on making the app more stable i think hardcore players i don't know though like i feel like hardcore players would be like yes i would want a more stable app whereas like casual players would be like well the game is like you're not adding anything new the game is boring i'm going to leave the majority of people are going to be like retain retain my interest or you're lost me forever i would just like them to fix the fact that at least 55 of the time when i attempt to bring my buddy into the real world and feed it berries it just sits there it spins for five minutes and then says network air network air network air until i close the app you need to get it again the fiber internet is the problem is your butt is your buddy a spinda no oh okay my buddy is a shiny butt dude right now um i have never had anybody issues i have buddy issues all the time interesting instantly what i what oh you're five five the new whatever 14.15 or whatever whatever it is i don't know yeah i've never had buddy issues it's just they have low quality internet on that part of minneapolis so that's you're low quality internet i've got fiber sir i have it when i'm using this is the only issue i have frequently and it's not even that frequent it's like once every five hours if i'm hardcore playing go is when i have the pokeball plus active it will continue working but i can't spin my character my character will still walk the pokemon will still spawn in the pokeball plus will still work but my character will just like i can't move the camera i get that everyone will do i'm on 14.4.2 oh i don't know if that's the latest uh it says my software is up to date so apple thinks so yeah that's what i'm on to 14.4.2 yeah i've never had the badoo issue maybe it's just badou it's not it happens on all of them i had a mammal swine issue i had wait have they all been shiny mama's wine isn't shiny gardevoir was is and badu is and roserade is yeah but i think yeah i think the the the question of like would would most people be okay with niantic not adding new stuff and instead of just making the game more stable i think the answer is time was short i think it was a month yes i think if it was like it's going to take three months to do this i think you would lose casual players you have to do something spectacular to bring them back i'd be i i kind of wish i played ingress because they did that whole revamp of ingress at that time no i'm not gonna play ingress now i'm just saying that you wish that you played ingress this is within your control you can obtain this way it's not difficult no no no i was saying i wish i knew like i wish i played ingress and saw the progression of that game to the point where they revamped it and to see what that was what was it greg i don't remember old ingress i don't remember the revamp i do know that people were very excited and pretty positive about the revamp uh so i'm trying to remember old ingress i think when it first launched i had three teams and then the revamp cut it down to two uh oh ingress went from like i tried maybe i'm thinking of a different game uh but yeah it was not very fun before and then they when they revamped it it was a lot more control you could do a lot more things it was easier to do a bunch of stuff uh because i played it sort of before and then after the revamp it was a lot more fun and then go came in and i was like buying chris going to pokemon go it was a pretty big change but they had lost they had lost so many people playing ingress that i don't think it hurt them to revamp it because they needed to do something yeah i don't think they would ever do like pokemon go too but i feel like there would be a point where they were like we're going to overhaul the whole app maybe that would be like when they catch up with pokemon and they're like oh gosh we need something we need something else to do here and they just recently updated ingress to be more like pokemon go like in the last three years maybe there was two revamps of ingress because i swear there was a revamp like two years ago yeah there was one two years ago and i think there was one wait when did the ingress come out 20 chris was 2012. i think so so i think there was one in 2014 2015 as they were getting ready to do go and then there's been another one in 2018. that sounds right uh to make up for the team rocket which was away shadow zapdos will return when you defeat giovanni between june 1st through june 17th this is june yeah that's a long time away wait but okay they came back and i defeated giovanni and i got mine was the shadow zapdos like today like yesterday oh they're going to give it to you again because they've got to follow the old rotation that they had planned i don't even know how you get giovanni outside of these events can you you're supposed to you're supposed to defeat so in the game there was a spot where it would say like team rocket trouble whatever and it would always remember how many leaders you beat so when you beat arlo cliff and sierra it would then give you the giovanni radar to find giovanni but when the pandemic started they disabled that because that was supposed to reset once a month okay that's why um so you can now only get giovanni when you have giovanni radar and they've been doing these special events where like giovanni's back but they're like giving you the radar for completing something hmm so you probably ha so i bet you had the giovanni radar obviously yes you used it but they're saying we're not giving any giovanni radars out once june comes we'll be giving the giovanni radar out and if you missed it um the zapdos here's your opportunity to get it yeah i gotta get it that this makes sense now i had to walk through that slowly all right speaking of walking pokemon question of the week we're there already dude it's the 25th anniversary we only have some we can only put so much exciting 25th news in an episode is it snowing out is it no it can't be snowing here well uh all right what's the question of the week what's the question of the week that's a good one i have to look to see if it's snowing hold on while steve looks i have the questions maybe that's rain i i could have been mistaken it is not snowing up here is it raining no it's not all right we can do the we can do two questions here first one is from patrick from our slack from from last night's stream if instagram was a thing in the pokemon world what character would have the most followers um oh are we talking like people not pokemon yeah why pokemon other than rotom has access to a camera and can use that look pikachu's on cameras yeah people will take pictures of pikachu so picture printers not on here's the thing ash has an instagram and he has pikachu's instagram where so ash poses his boring life and he's got like five followers but his pikachu page that he runs has a lot so in that way ash's pikachu probably has a lot of followers second is rihanna fascist pikachu is significantly more popular than ash yes way more popular ash has like ash on average gets five likes for his brunch shots this is what i'm eating today for brunch and pikachu falls off a log and there's like a million likes and it kind of bugs ash you know that eats him up inside but he gets a lot of really good deals through pikachu so he can't really stop doing it i mean his life is now taking pictures of pikachu the free pikachu food treats toys thank you but he resents pikachu at this i don't think ash would be that high on an instagram thing he wouldn't no pikachu is pikachu is ash's pikachu the pikachu in the overall pokemon world i would okay so hold on okay if we're just talking pokemon okay pikachu would be number one and like mewtwo and charizard and great ninja would probably be like top five because at that point you're just ranking like popular pokemon yeah no no no no no that's not do you like have you ever used instagram yes i have but the thing is you don't do you because like right it's like i have i have my instagram wash in the sink right i have my finsta which you all don't know and if you don't know what a finsta is i'm you're too old then i actually manage the instagram for scrapple now wash in the sink has like 450 instagram followers scrapple has 250 000 instagram followers because people enjoy evil cats yes so ash has like five followers yes but ash's pikachu yes has a lot giovanni and youtube is rivaling the kardashians yes it is i don't think ash's pikachu would have a bunch of followers because uh because there are other more famous pikachus in the pokemon world there are not master chewster who the movie star pikachu from alola yeah he would have more followers than ash's pikachu he's a famous pikachu no no ashley bring show me show me where masterchester exists what do you mean or massachusetts show it to me show me his instagram page you know misty is out there on tick tock she's doing all the dancing we can't we will not take any creative liberty with this question and start talking about other social medias not yeah we will i i think greg is right as ry ryhan right very high yes probably nessa because she's in fashion she's a model she's a model no but uh uh alyssa uh yeah uh elisa elisa yeah she would be pretty absolutely does iris iris probably is up there because people are just fascinated how this kid became champion she has a lot of hate comments though but she doesn't want to get her down uh we know bryson mann is constantly upset at how how many followers he doesn't have bryce and man try hard on instagram yeah oh milo is like uh our our friend house plant daddy yeah milo milo has a very vivid plant blog milo not not in the top charts though no not very happy braden drayton has a certain followers we'll have to talk about that next week that follows daddy's follows drayden's stuff totally okay but what what what trainers are not using instagram like i don't think lenora's usually lenora is got no time who's the old man in the tree technology person no uh none of the or koga no koga either the cooks don't have it silly and cress and no they the people love they're taking pictures of their food i think of their food but they don't do it themselves they may have an instagram for their restaurant but not for them because nobody cares about them the wall no one cares about whatever they do professor oak and samson oak are on uh clubhouse they're holding forums i'm not supposed to talk about other services all right second question here here is if you had to design one pokemon product for the 25th anniversary of fantasy has a great instagram that was that was from brandon no one likes to design one pokemon product what do you mean i love fantina yeah fantina would have a fantastic instagram be real be real 25th anniversary product product yeah a butter dish they've never done that before a printer that will print out pictures that you can have in your house and it's a small compact printer okay they didn't design that though okay so 25th anniversary i would have an official licensed tabletop rpg they would give the license to somebody and somebody would actually make that and it was an awful game no that was a board game yeah that game was bad though and i own it and i'm not saying a board game i'm saying a table top rpg like dungeons and dragons or star wars is d d popular in japan oh yeah really huge oh okay there's three enemies that were based off of anime that was like a serious question i had no clue yeah uh d is pretty big uh they have like they have to have like the d and d normal like wizards publish publishes like a japanese version of the book right yes okay i mean they publish japanese versions of pretty much everything it is wizards right like wizards is doing it yeah now but when d d first started in the 80s uh it was big in japan and then i got bigger because a group of players mated uh made an anime of their adventure and they call it the record of the lodos war uh and it's been pretty big like i wouldn't say it's like and well dnd just isn't a top fandom i mean it's big but i thought it was pretty big i mean it's it's it ha it's had a resurgence but it's still like there's still a lot of people who've never heard of it um but it's been pretty steady in japan for a very long time and they actually did put out a kids version of an rpg way way back in the day like 2000 2001 pokemon emergency [Music] they were supposed to do like multiple sets but they only did uh yeah they only did one they only did like two i think they only did one as far as i know oh i thought they came out with the second one wasn't there one with like spiro on the cover and then the second one was jigglypuff on the cover uh no because i think it was only pokemon junior adventure game pokemon emergency junior adventure emergency yeah i don't think there's another one i think oh i think in the box yes there's like a pamphlet that shows the second one yes but i don't yeah i think you're right it never happened but they they had like five planned yes and you can go on ebay and you can buy like a box of the emergencies you can get like 20 of them for 50 bucks or something did that come out it had been like 2 000. we should play that greg i actually own it like a sealed copy of it wait is that mythical is coming back don't start rumors we're gonna get a bunch of people tweeting at me pokemon junior adventure game looks like it was 2000 to 2001 somewhere in there yeah we can play that when you move here we'll play it on stream it's it's it's like in the the early 2000s they were trying to license everything with pokemon not that they don't do that today well no that's what i was thinking it's like it's really hard to answer this question because what ha pokemon is has merchandise merchandised themselves out as much as almost as much as disney right it's just like there's not a yeah if you're just a toaster they they there's a pikachu toaster that exists like i mean i i was gonna say pokemon sheets but there's probably pokemon yeah pokemon sheets i had them when i was a kid i had star receipts as a kid they've done underwear they've done levi's what other 25th anniversary i would have another watch their watches are are well maybe a pokemon slash you know crossover watch let's go with omega not rolex okay let's let's let's be hip this is what i would want it's very specific but you know how on the apple watch disney licensed the mickey mouse face yeah you do mickey mouse and minnie like a mickey mouse watch is a very classic american watch to have yeah yeah i would want them to like app i don't know how that works i don't know if like disney approached apple or apple approached disney or apple definitely approached yeah absolutely hey can we include mickey mouse a classic watch on our watch faces yeah but it would be cool if you could have pikachu would pikachu's tail move that would be the minute hand well then his arm would do how does mickey mickey is just as too armed but pikachu has very tiny arms yes wouldn't work very well you could have two pikachus the male and the female and then their tails their tails their tails do this the tails touch crossing uh what else would i want for 25th god you know would be great is if they had a cd or an album release of pop stars making pokemon songs like a katy perry or a post malone yeah really great they could even go international and get just a bunch a worldwide phenomenon list of artists maybe even have like some sort of weird virtual concert that would be so cool i felt like i said we got nothing i was gonna say like i'm surprised there's not a mario pikachu crossed over but they did actually do that like four years ago yeah they had pikachu's in little mario outfits oh yeah well it was when they opened the nintendo store which was no that was like two years ago that was like right before the pandemic um i think and then obviously nintendo world is i think now open in japan i have no answers uh pokemon grill i don't think they've done that yet like a weber grill yeah no no like uh was it is it amazon no what rainforest cafe except pokemon cafe pokemon cafe wait they have that in japan yeah they have a pokemon cafe already so they would have a pic they would have to have a pikachu weber grill would they have a snorlax where it's like snorlax's face and you open it up and the mouth opens and you have burgers inside yes i'd buy that what would it not just be a car coal no nobody like no not wherever den wanters are not buying stuff people are not buying a car coal weber grill they're buying a pikachu grill and they're buying a snorlax grill okay what about nobody you could put charizard on it they would have a charizard grill there you go and the tail would go inside and have like the flame by the coals see they need to approach us we could really pump out a great 25th anniversary you know i'm gonna say in the last 15 minutes i don't think we had any good ideas i think they're all bad what was your good idea steve the the apple watch after after i said watch after i said new watch you're like making an apple watch hey how about a pokemon fitbit no because i got an apple watch i don't even know fitbit i don't know looking around my room to see like is there anything in here that i don't need two things uh pokemon wi-fi router uh you know i don't think there's a pokemon wi-fi router i think that is i think that's still an untapped market do they have pokemon usb jump drives um they don't have uh oh they oh like a flash drive they might have a flash drive because i have a star wars one they have the cable dongles you know those things where you um yeah you like put your cable through it and then when you plug it in it looks like pikachu is like biting your phone they have those those are really popular in japan all right speaking of pokemon pokemon of the week speaking of pokemon that's all i'm pretty sure i said at the beginning of pokemon of the week last week i was like once again listen to all the words and yet people didn't uh i think the main thing you know it was i was the focus i i was like let me bring pokemon go up in here we don't talk about pokemon go and pokemon of the week that often i was like we've got a new pokemon that was introduced to pokemon go and you could get it through wild encounters or one star which is also another huge indication to you uh one star raids or for research tasks and then the other thing i went through about how it has the um inability that's uh boost pulse moves which is called mega launcher is the ability i didn't say that as part of the clue but i did say that the pokemon for the week could learn four pulse moves which are boosted by mega launcher um but uh and i then i said another of the new pokemon introduced to go for rivals week of the four of new ones that were introduced uh the the other one can learn six of the seven which would mean like that that it's the evolution of this one and a lot of people just didn't pay attention to that either way who's that pokemon gangler there's only three pokemon that can learn mega launcher or have the mega launcher ability because one of them is clauncher cluncher has one of the best shinies it's just like for everybody who thought it was clawed sir like tip about pokemon go if they're introducing a new pokemon they typically don't introduce the evolution as like it's like you get the new pokemon then you have to evolve it in the game that's how they get you to get the candies i really like the shuffle icon shuffle icon's good it's really good and i like the fact that i like what they did for the shinies blue shrimp versus red shrimp which is a real life thing um any trivia no it's just the trivia is just what it's based off of which is a pistol shrimp yeah yeah it shoots water with its little squirty and claws really wow really uh there is uh uh clawlitz or at least in pokemon snap we saw in the trailer i don't know if there's a cluncher in pokemon snap but that we at least saw a clawlitzer in the game well we only have so many slots for pokemon so only 200 and once one of those pokemon when i first saw it i was like i hate this but over time it's actually really cool like like when i first played x and y i was like this is a very forgettable pokemon it's not for masculine wait does that mean that clawitzer and dragalgi are i'm you are so wrong and go back into the hole you crawled out of okay because uh they are awesome they are virgin exclusives yeah they i guess they would be considered rivals in the sense that like scripp and drag algae or lock to one and then clawlitzer and like i there probably wouldn't be they would probably wouldn't pull a sword and shield and only have one of them they'd probably have both but then keep them version exclusive still yeah the mock kelp pokemon who are you looking at drug algae chicagi is it's it's poison dragon it's just like it was like the answer to the introduced introduction of fairy type i also just like saying script script is cute it's a little cutie scrub's cute dragon launcher is like trek i think the my problem with drag algae it's so thin [Music] but that's how the actual real creature is yeah that's based off of you don't like seahorses no not really they're kind of weird you know like horsey sidra kindra seahorses are so cool i mean so i don't like a lot of things that come from the ocean though i mean so okay look up the leafy sea dragon and you will see what it's based off of no i've seen what it's based off of it's weird-looking it looks like a leaf it's like looking at like a grasshopper i don't want to look at it what's wrong with grasshoppers i don't like looking at bugs i i'm so confused i like i like like i like looking at combi is aesthetically a appealing appeasing because it's in your little boxes that you have to put in yeah yeah but then if i'm on twitter and i'm scrolling and i'm seeing pictures of bees or honeybees or wasps i'm like oh i'm out i don't want to look at i don't want to look at you are you scared they're cute it's too buggy sweetie peas they don't fit into steve's box anything that has any sort of creativity some flow to it he's like nah i don't want to see that you need to be perfectly square clean and in this corner that's right the fact that you have a leak sticking out of your head has been distracting me this entire time i feel like it's falling over more and more yeah it's really it's really gone downhill poor africa doesn't have a chair anymore yeah i noticed that i don't need a chair he's slowly moving up on you obviously very busy trying to get moved out of my old house into my new house so didn't have a lot of time to write a pokemon of the week so this is what you get folks there are four pokemon games where you start the game within a moving truck only four right maybe five wait greg you're the one that wrote it there's five yeah there's five there are five pokemon games where you start the game within a moving truck which pokemon is chasing the professor at the beginning of those games there you go i i i got i gotta get my love sack over here i know i know i know this is a podcast um in the podcast uh podchaser feel free to leave us a review there it will go to charity if you are thinking of throwing money at the disaster of this program uh patreon.com wait until may 1st may 1st may 1st if you're already a current patron i did say this in our update thank you will be grand thank you and you will be grandfathered into whatever it does so like if your two dollars gets you slack if that reward is technically going away um but everyone who's there they'll get to keep it like we're not gonna suddenly kick you out because two dollars isn't enough or whatever you're you're safe everyone will be grandfathered in um so if we raise a reward to you from 25 to 26 which is not happening but if we were two you would be grandfathered into that not trying to extort one extra dollar out of you extort is the right word right and it's false in this general area close enough whatever uh if you want to follow greg on twitter whitewing will on twitter at watching the sync i'm at on twitter at dragging a lake uh podcast pcamencast on

thoughts on pokemon snap and we have to watch your stream uh i don't know well are you getting pokemon stuff i most likely will unless this move completely bankrupts me yes okay i'll i'll have thoughts on pokemon stuff i'll definitely have thoughts about watching you play pokemon snap i can guarantee that maybe the real twist you find out next week if after greg watching pokemon snap greg buys pokemon snap you know i can't buy anything for myself this month yeah but it resets on the first yeah may no from april 19th to my birthday may 19th i am forbidden from buying stuff because everybody's saying steve he wants you to buy him pokemon snap everybody in my life is like we don't know what to buy you always buy stuff for yourself so we i struck a deal i'm not allowed to buy myself anything the month before my birthday hmm it's a good strat and then i just added to my amazon list and then what do they say to me i don't want to buy something off your list and i can't with these people like what do you want to do then they just get you a gift card like which i'm fine with but what i don't like is when you like i remember you were into this thing 15 years ago and it's stuck in my head so i gotta buy it for you so like beanie babies yeah okay beanie babies were like 23 years ago yeah well they came back for a while i don't know mcdonald's sometimes stalks them when
