hey what's going on this episode was a (0:00 - 0:05)
little bit weird because we recorded (0:03 - 0:08)
like three hours of content and I try (0:05 - 0:10)
for 90 minutes I think we got it to like (0:08 - 0:13)
just under two hours so you're probably (0:10 - 0:15)
like what happened to the other hour (0:13 - 0:18)
well two things one this episode has (0:15 - 0:21)
about a 45 minute now maybe it's like 40 (0:18 - 0:25)
minute interview with Nate real breaking (0:21 - 0:29)
Nate youtuber content creator we talked (0:25 - 0:31)
about his love of Pokemon where he (0:29 - 0:33)
started from if you're one of Nate's (0:31 - 0:35)
fans this is your first time listening (0:33 - 0:37)
hopefully you enjoyed the whole entire (0:35 - 0:39)
episode but the Nate part starts about (0:37 - 0:42)
50 minutes in the first part is news and (0:39 - 0:44)
whatnot the other thing is we actually (0:42 - 0:47)
recorded news second this episode and we (0:44 - 0:50)
spent the first 45 minutes talking about (0:47 - 0:53)
leaked culture like people leaking stuff (0:50 - 0:56)
not necessarily the Pokemon leaks that (0:53 - 0:58)
have existed those are out there you can (0:56 - 1:00)
go see them if you want we don't talk (0:58 - 1:02)
about them we talked about how these (1:00 - 1:05)
leaks are different or maybe the same as (1:02 - 1:08)
the Sun and Moon leaks and the X&Y leaks (1:05 - 1:10)
so again not specifically talking about (1:08 - 1:12)
we don't talk at all about whatcha (1:10 - 1:14)
pokemon have or have not been shown we (1:12 - 1:16)
just talk about the what has happened in (1:14 - 1:19)
the past and what should happen going (1:16 - 1:20)
forward with that well that's not in (1:19 - 1:22)
this episode I cut that all it was about (1:20 - 1:24)
45 minutes so what we're doing instead (1:22 - 1:27)
is this episode we'll start with some (1:24 - 1:31)
ring fit adventure only because we'll (1:27 - 1:32)
and Greg wanted me to talk about it and (1:31 - 1:35)
then we talked about pokemon news and (1:32 - 1:38)
then the interview with Nate and then we (1:35 - 1:39)
come back and we do our question of the (1:38 - 1:41)
week and our Pokemon of the week so (1:39 - 1:43)
pretty much like a standard episode at (1:41 - 1:47)
45 minutes about what happened with past (1:43 - 1:49)
Pokemon games leaked wise and what's (1:47 - 1:52)
happening with this Pokemon game that's (1:49 - 1:55)
going to be over on the patreon for free (1:52 - 1:58)
so even if you're not a patreon backer (1:55 - 2:02)
you can go to ISE cash or patreon.com (1:58 - 2:06)
slash it's super effective and you'll be (2:02 - 2:08)
able to listen to at 45 minutes (2:06 - 2:10)
completely freed you don't go sign-in (2:08 - 2:11)

can you do you but that'll be completely (2:13 - 2:17)
free if you need something extra in the (2:15 - 2:20)
week to listen to I think Greg and will (2:17 - 2:23)
had excellent points I guess I tried to (2:20 - 2:25)
play devil's advocate for stuff just so (2:23 - 2:29)
we didn't all talk on the same points (2:25 - 2:32)
but it's if you wanted to know what (2:29 - 2:34)
happened with like the X&Y stuff and the (2:32 - 2:35)
Sun and Moon stuff and what's happening (2:34 - 2:38)
here and not worried about being spoiled (2:35 - 2:40)
of you know score Barney's evolution (2:38 - 2:43)
because we don't again really stressed (2:40 - 2:45)
and we don't talk about any of that I (2:43 - 2:48)
think you should check it out is C dot (2:45 - 2:49)
cache probably the easiest thing to (2:48 - 2:51)
remember or in the show notes where it (2:49 - 2:53)
says patreon just click that link takes (2:51 - 2:55)
you right there if you want to listen if (2:53 - 2:57)

intro so hopefully you enjoy (2:59 - 3:03)

politely introduced before I made my (4:00 - 4:05)
commentary well will is here Shepard (4:02 - 4:08)
let's pile it on all right so I'm part (4:05 - 4:14)
of the boys now I got no no no I am the (4:08 - 4:16)
only one here with a six pack true I (4:14 - 4:21)
mean I have a 12 pack in my fridge hey I (4:16 - 4:23)
was I was I was getting ready I was very (4:21 - 4:26)
excited to induct you into the (4:23 - 4:28)
association of clangers and bangers okay (4:26 - 4:32)
and then I watched that twitch stream (4:28 - 4:35)
and I'm sorry but jumping up and down (4:32 - 4:37)
with a squishy score circle in your hand (4:35 - 4:41)
does not count as either clanging and/or (4:37 - 4:44)
banging no no way shapes in it's (4:41 - 4:47)
squishing in fishing mmm (4:44 - 4:50)
okay oh hold on hold on this is a (4:47 - 4:54)
teasing Pokemon podcast but let's like (4:50 - 4:56)
take two minutes to talk about ring fit (4:54 - 5:00)
healthy living segments returning (4:56 - 5:02)
welcome to healthy living (5:00 - 5:06)
are you doubting these are you saying (5:02 - 5:07)
that you think the ring fit thing is (5:06 - 5:12)
squishy is that super hard to press it (5:07 - 5:14)
you had to squeeze it in order to fire (5:12 - 5:18)
off your your shots at the though when (5:14 - 5:19)
you we had to fly and you were doing the (5:18 - 5:22)
the run in place and fly and jump and (5:19 - 5:25)
get the coins yeah I had to squeeze and (5:22 - 5:26)
then it was like you got to keep (5:25 - 5:28)
squeezing it dude you're not squeezing (5:26 - 5:30)
it long enough the only thing I thought (5:28 - 5:32)
was you attempting to do squats my spots (5:30 - 5:36)
were inform you (5:32 - 5:39)
or not you were not inform I beg to (5:36 - 5:40)
differ (5:39 - 5:42)
well okay so they mmm so for those (5:40 - 5:45)
add-ons for over your toes ring-ring fit (5:42 - 5:50)
Adventure is a Nintendo published game (5:45 - 5:52)
made by I actually don't know who made (5:50 - 5:52)
it (5:52 - 5:55)
Nintendo's I don't know what part of (5:52 - 5:57)
Nintendo made it Nintendo has like 14 (5:55 - 6:01)
Nintendo fit but Nando torture chamber (5:57 - 6:04)
disclosure they they sent me this it's (6:01 - 6:08)
but it's a it's a fitness game you could (6:04 - 6:11)
maybe say it's like Wii Fit where you (6:08 - 6:14)
put the joy Khan into what what is the (6:11 - 6:15)
proper it's like a yoga ring I don't (6:14 - 6:17)
know what they're actually called it's (6:15 - 6:19)
not a real thing so call it whatever you (6:17 - 6:22)
want a squeezy Pilates ring that's what (6:19 - 6:24)
its gonna know Pilates going on there (6:22 - 6:27)
what are you where was there's no (6:24 - 6:31)
reformer what is hurry forward that is (6:27 - 6:33)
what you use for Pilates because I think (6:31 - 6:36)
anyone watching and not experiencing (6:33 - 6:38)
ring fit looks that looks at it and (6:36 - 6:39)
probably thinks it's like a gimmick like (6:38 - 6:41)
Wii Fit (6:39 - 6:43)
although like Wii Fit the problem with (6:41 - 6:46)
Wii Fit is there's like no feedback of (6:43 - 6:48)
whether you're doing something right or (6:46 - 6:49)
wrong right because the the board (6:48 - 6:52)
doesn't vibrate or doesn't give you (6:49 - 6:54)
resistance or any sort of peed back to (6:52 - 6:56)
tell you're doing something correct or (6:54 - 6:57)
incorrect (6:56 - 6:59)
I guess though like it could tell your (6:57 - 7:01)
balance but the the Pilates ring that it (6:59 - 7:03)
comes with I mean you can get a Pilates (7:01 - 7:06)
ring for like 15 bucks on Amazon you put (7:03 - 7:08)
the joique on on and the whole Pilates (7:06 - 7:11)
ring gives you feedback and stuff and (7:08 - 7:14)
you have to squeeze it and hold it or (7:11 - 7:17)
pull it if you go back and watch my (7:14 - 7:19)
first stream I'm doing it and okay so (7:17 - 7:21)
the part the whole part in the game is (7:19 - 7:23)
like you're you're getting a workout and (7:21 - 7:25)
doing an RPG so you're like going (7:23 - 7:26)
through the world and the monsters pop (7:25 - 7:28)
up and then it's almost like a Pokemon (7:26 - 7:30)
or a final fantasy where like you have (7:28 - 7:33)
to they attack you you have to attack (7:30 - 7:35)
them you defeat them you move on in the (7:33 - 7:37)
world more monsters pop up and then (7:35 - 7:39)
eventually you're fighting this giant (7:37 - 7:42)
workout dragon who has like a 30 pack (7:39 - 7:45)
and these where's William R Anderson (7:42 - 7:46)
right there (7:45 - 7:48)
that's the only workout dragon I care (7:46 - 7:49)
about so I'm doing it the (7:48 - 7:51)
first day because okay and there's four (7:49 - 7:53)
levels there's like casual moderate (7:51 - 7:55)
intense and extreme and I was like well (7:53 - 7:58)
I have never I haven't done any exercise (7:55 - 7:59)
in like two years (7:58 - 8:01)
I used to run a long time ago so I was (7:59 - 8:03)
like I'll do intense because I doubt (8:01 - 8:05)
it's like a gimmick yeah well I think (8:03 - 8:07)
it's a gimmick so I doubt I will (8:05 - 8:09)
actually get a decent workout from this (8:07 - 8:12)
and like within you know I think my (8:09 - 8:13)
first workout was like 45 minutes within (8:12 - 8:15)
20 minutes I'm like sweating my legs (8:13 - 8:17)
feel like noodles my arms feel like (8:15 - 8:21)
noodles and then my wife Irene comes in (8:17 - 8:24)
and she's just laughing at me you can (8:21 - 8:26)
see this on stream she's like making (8:24 - 8:31)
making fun of me she's telling me that I (8:26 - 8:32)
need to squat lower (8:31 - 8:36)
she's quite lower okay but why at that (8:32 - 8:40)
point my legs are like completes liquid (8:36 - 8:43)
noodles maybe eat fewer noodles and so (8:40 - 8:47)
then twitch chat bless their hearts they (8:43 - 8:50)
convinced Irene to do it and Irene was (8:47 - 8:53)
like well I I read and works out more (8:50 - 8:56)
than I do so she also did intense (8:53 - 8:58)
because she had to match slash beat me (8:56 - 9:00)
and within like 15 minutes (8:58 - 9:02)
she's like sweating and she's like (9:00 - 9:04)
apologizing to twitch chat for making (9:02 - 9:06)
fun of me because she was like oh my (9:04 - 9:07)
gosh I didn't realize like this is a (9:06 - 9:10)
real thing like I'm act my arms hurt (9:07 - 9:12)
like this game made me break a sweat (9:10 - 9:15)
it's really cool what I mean if you're (9:12 - 9:16)
already going to the gym I don't know if (9:15 - 9:19)
like this is what you need in life is (9:16 - 9:21)
certainly not what I need in life so (9:19 - 9:26)
correct question answered I want to (9:21 - 9:28)
fight the workout because it sounds good (9:26 - 9:31)
but I don't need it for sure if you're (9:28 - 9:33)
not going to a gym well if you are going (9:31 - 9:35)
to a gym yeah like I said you probably (9:33 - 9:37)
don't need it but I guess like if there (9:35 - 9:39)
was like an off chance where you can't (9:37 - 9:40)
go to the gym and you need like a quick (9:39 - 9:43)
45 minute workout at home I guess you (9:40 - 9:45)
could do this I mean it might be good (9:43 - 9:47)
for those times when I'm traveling and a (9:45 - 9:49)
few steps Toto there's things that (9:47 - 9:51)
there's things in the workout that you (9:49 - 9:53)
don't need the ring for but you also (9:51 - 9:55)
besides like the ring there's like a leg (9:53 - 9:58)
strap that you put on so in this case (9:55 - 9:59)
we're like the game makes you do (9:58 - 10:01)
crunches (9:59 - 10:04)
oh my favorite the leg strap is like you (10:01 - 10:06)
you can't use the ring for crunches but (10:04 - 10:09)
the leg strap judges you I guess on that (10:06 - 10:16)
and again my life judging me it's it's (10:09 - 10:18)
cool it's very cool I I'm wondering (10:16 - 10:20)
where the novelty runs off with somebody (10:18 - 10:26)
I I heard that if you do the recommended (10:20 - 10:28)
workout every day which i think is like (10:26 - 10:30)
30 minutes it'll take you to 90 days to (10:28 - 10:34)
like beat the story mode so my question (10:30 - 10:36)
is after seven days (10:34 - 10:40)
does a person climb out of your whatever (10:36 - 10:43)
screen your switch is attached to and (10:40 - 10:47)
like I don't know she killed them or (10:43 - 10:52)
yeah yeah yeah I get it (10:47 - 10:55)
yes that movie you know that movie myth (10:52 - 10:58)
and other things Jesus I mean October (10:55 - 11:00)
was just three days ago and how soon you (10:58 - 11:04)
all forgets the good googly Gauri's (11:00 - 11:07)
loyal boy it is countdown to (11:04 - 11:09)
thanksgiving American style (11:07 - 11:11)
no no no I've met your husband it's (11:09 - 11:15)
always Ghoulie Gauri's in your home he's (11:11 - 11:17)
not a lot of watch Cooley Gauri's while (11:15 - 11:20)
I'm here oh man she gives me nightmares (11:17 - 11:22)
okay so this is our plan for the episode (11:20 - 11:24)
we have this episode and we have next (11:22 - 11:26)
week's episode and then sword and shield (11:24 - 11:29)
are available so next week we're doing (11:26 - 11:31)
something a little bit special I will (11:29 - 11:34)
leave it there you guys can look forward (11:31 - 11:36)
to it next week but that's next week is (11:34 - 11:38)
our from what what's the date on that (11:36 - 11:44)
the sari xi xi now it'd be the 10th oh (11:38 - 11:46)
that one the 10th will were the 10th (11:44 - 11:51)
we're recording when it comes out so xi (11:46 - 11:54)
enter be the last full normal episode of (11:51 - 11:57)
ISE and then starting on the 15th 16th (11:54 - 11:59)
17th 18th you'll be getting daily (11:57 - 12:01)
episodes like we've done for Sun and (11:59 - 12:03)
Moon and X&Y and we skipped Omega Ruby (12:01 - 12:08)
alpha sapphire pity best game ever so (12:03 - 12:11)
there before we get into news we just (12:08 - 12:14)
should just close this there was (12:11 - 12:16)
at this point as of recording pretty (12:14 - 12:19)
much all the Pokemon have leaked from (12:16 - 12:20)
sword and shield whether that was (12:19 - 12:23)
through somebody it seemed that somebody (12:20 - 12:25)
probably bought a copy at a Mon pawn (12:23 - 12:26)
shop and they were taking pictures of (12:25 - 12:28)
their switch screen but then it looks (12:26 - 12:30)
like that somebody was maybe working in (12:28 - 12:33)
like a warehouse with the guidebook and (12:30 - 12:35)
they were taking pictures of that and (12:33 - 12:36)
you would assume they were maybe scared (12:35 - 12:39)
they were getting caught because we live (12:36 - 12:41)
in 2019 I don't understand how you can (12:39 - 12:43)
take super blurry photos even if you had (12:41 - 12:44)
the chicken smartphone in the entire (12:43 - 12:47)
world and then recently it looks like (12:44 - 12:50)
somebody else has a has a book as well a (12:47 - 12:53)
guide book and they're taking much (12:50 - 12:57)
better pictures of said guidebook so (12:53 - 12:59)
that's out there if you want to go seek (12:57 - 13:01)
that out I'm sure it's very easy let's (12:59 - 13:05)
tackle some news here let's start with (13:01 - 13:09)
some anime news is off Eurogamer pokemon (13:05 - 13:13)
news and pokemons new TV season will (13:09 - 13:17)
tell us the story of baby Pikachu there (13:13 - 13:20)
is a new trailer for the new anime which (13:17 - 13:22)
I believe in English version I only saw (13:20 - 13:24)
the Japanese version isn't due until (13:22 - 13:27)
like April but the Japanese version (13:24 - 13:29)
comes out later this month because it's (13:27 - 13:33)
Geoff pan is on top of releasing their (13:29 - 13:36)
anime when the new games come out so (13:33 - 13:37)
they don't have to translate them that's (13:36 - 13:41)
true so the episode synopsis from (13:37 - 13:43)
crunchyroll says in a forest somewhere (13:41 - 13:46)
in Kanto there once was a lonely Picchu (13:43 - 13:50)
is Picchu who was still quite young had (13:46 - 13:52)
a certain encounter and farewell this (13:50 - 13:54)
took place shortly before Ash and his (13:52 - 13:56)
partner Pikachu started travelling (13:54 - 13:58)
together this is the beginning of the (13:56 - 14:01)
anime Pocket Monsters hmm looks like (13:58 - 14:04)
they're the start of this the season (14:01 - 14:06)
might have some flashbacks too (14:04 - 14:11)
Ash and Pikachu I don't know if well pre (14:06 - 14:14)
ash Pikachu yes but there are there (14:11 - 14:18)
isn't there is a Pikachu or is it Pichu (14:14 - 14:20)
this is a Pichu so this will be Ash's (14:18 - 14:23)
Pikachu as a Pichu which we've never (14:20 - 14:24)
seen before (14:23 - 14:26)
so the episode that aired today in Japan (14:24 - 14:28)
shows Ash going (14:26 - 14:30)
back to going somewhere he gets on a (14:28 - 14:34)
train and leaves a Lola or he's on he's (14:30 - 14:35)
on some vehicle I'm assuming at the (14:34 - 14:38)
Train I guess it could be something else (14:35 - 14:41)
so they they do have him leaving the (14:38 - 14:43)
aloha region at the end of this season (14:41 - 14:45)
while ash I guess normally technically (14:43 - 14:50)
gets reboot I mean he he still has all (14:45 - 14:51)
his Pokemon with Professor Oak as we saw (14:50 - 14:53)
it drops a mile off in Kanto Sun and (14:51 - 14:55)
Moon there is a scene from the new (14:53 - 14:57)
trailer where he throws his pokeball at (14:55 - 15:00)
the wall the little piggy like when he's (14:57 - 15:02)
late to get his starter Pokemon so they (15:00 - 15:04)
recreated that scene again so we don't (15:02 - 15:07)
know fully is is that a flashback scene (15:04 - 15:09)
or are they just going to do the first (15:07 - 15:13)
episode again again oh but now that (15:09 - 15:15)
they're like telling a backstory of (15:13 - 15:18)
Pichu it seems more likely that there's (15:15 - 15:19)
gonna be probably a lot of flashbacks in (15:18 - 15:23)
the first couple episodes of how this (15:19 - 15:25)
how their relationship formed so Oh (15:23 - 15:27)
interesting but with the deal I'll flash (15:25 - 15:29)
back to our with it just about like the (15:27 - 15:31)
first episode - sort of getting that (15:29 - 15:33)
backstory and then do flashbacks (15:31 - 15:36)
throughout the seat season I don't know (15:33 - 15:39)
it's according to Eurogamer this very (15:36 - 15:42)
first episode will be this very Pichu (15:39 - 15:45)
focus focused I'm intrigued although I (15:42 - 15:47)
have such a hard time watching any kind (15:45 - 15:50)
of television anymore look forward to (15:47 - 15:54)
that speaking of Sun and Moon as of (15:50 - 15:58)

apex of Sun and Moon series the Pokemon (16:33 - 16:38)
TCG Sun and Moon cosmic eclipse (16:35 - 16:40)
expansion boosts the connection of (16:38 - 16:42)
Pokemon and trainers and at lon (16:40 - 16:45)

of pokemon with sun and moon cosmic (17:05 - 17:11)
eclipse expansion over 230 cards nine (17:07 - 17:15)
brand new tag team G act Pokemon GX 7 (17:11 - 17:18)
more pokemon GX the first appearance of (17:15 - 17:21)
tag team supporter cards and more than (17:18 - 17:24)
20 trainer and new special energy cards (17:21 - 17:30)
and this set has a whopping 230 cards (17:24 - 17:35)
Kula and 5 of them are actually good so (17:30 - 17:39)
I'm assuming the Arceus dialga Palkia is (17:35 - 17:42)
much like the other trio card never (17:39 - 17:48)
gonna see play probably like so in it it (17:42 - 17:52)
has 1 attack and a GX attack and the one (17:48 - 17:55)
attack includes a water a metal and a (17:52 - 17:57)
colorless energy which I can tell you (17:55 - 17:59)
right off the bat most decks don't run (17:57 - 18:02)
to different types of energy so that (17:59 - 18:04)
already seems pretty bad who knows (18:02 - 18:06)
though I mean there might be they might (18:04 - 18:08)
be might be so good that it might be (18:06 - 18:11)
worth running up to split energy deck (18:08 - 18:14)
this a few energies is not that bad (18:11 - 18:16)
yeah but it's the three energies you're (18:14 - 18:19)
asking for too much usually it's never (18:16 - 18:21)
three though they usually it's like 100 (18:19 - 18:25)
all one energy oh like half half one (18:21 - 18:27)
energy and like three of a different or (18:25 - 18:28)
you're running like a ho deck where (18:27 - 18:30)
you're running one of every energy I (18:28 - 18:32)
think you're like getting them in the (18:30 - 18:35)
discard pile as fast as possible because (18:32 - 18:37)
like that's how hos mechanic always (18:35 - 18:41)
works I want to say as I'm like talking (18:37 - 18:43)
and looking this up I want to say this (18:41 - 18:47)
is the last Sun and Moon set (18:43 - 18:49)
oh it should be we are done because (18:47 - 18:53)
they've already shown GRU key they've (18:49 - 18:54)
already shown groupies oblong score (18:53 - 18:56)
bunny cards yes according to Bob poppy (18:54 - 18:59)
dia this is the last Sun and Moon set (18:56 - 19:01)
and then the next set should be going (18:59 - 19:05)
into sword and shield which I don't (19:01 - 19:08)
think besides the the cards I just named (19:05 - 19:11)
oh I guess Goerke score bunny Sowell's a (19:08 - 19:14)
Shion and zama Zenta V cards were shown (19:11 - 19:19)
so that is supposed to come out in (19:14 - 19:22)
Japanese on December 6 and then in (19:19 - 19:26)
English on February 7th and the English (19:22 - 19:29)
set will have 87 cards the Japanese oh (19:26 - 19:30)
sorry (19:29 - 19:33)
the English set will have 212 200 cards (19:30 - 19:36)
and the Japanese set will have 120 which (19:33 - 19:40)
means that between the time of the (19:36 - 19:42)
December release in Japan and the (19:40 - 19:44)
February release in English Japan will (19:42 - 19:46)
probably have a bunch of mini sets come (19:44 - 19:50)
out like they always do think with this (19:46 - 19:53)
we are we are completely like caught up (19:50 - 19:56)
ish I think now that Cod when cosmic (19:53 - 19:58)
because Cosmic Encounter just came out I (19:56 - 20:01)
think Japan and and America are now (19:58 - 20:03)
caught up with sets I don't think John (20:01 - 20:05)
has any cards that we don't at this (20:03 - 20:09)
point this full art cuffing card is (20:05 - 20:12)
incredible looking the art (20:09 - 20:14)
Oh full arts are always great yeah I (20:12 - 20:18)
doubt like from cosmic it's so good (20:14 - 20:24)
Oh The Roxy card yeah it's incredible it (20:18 - 20:27)
is very good I mean the the Magnemite (20:24 - 20:31)
cards cute and so is the Pikachu (20:27 - 20:36)

just killing me inside how much I want (22:33 - 22:39)
that stupid train but by the time this (22:35 - 22:40)
episode goes up we'll know how much it (22:39 - 22:43)
costs or each train part cost we'll know (22:40 - 22:44)
what it's made out of I think it looks (22:43 - 22:47)
it looks ceramic right yeah it's (22:44 - 22:49)
probably like most of those types which (22:47 - 22:54)
is a ceramic table topper like there's (22:49 - 22:58)
like a million of those style although (22:54 - 22:59)
I'm on the website right now and this (22:58 - 23:01)
delibird presents holiday crew net (22:59 - 23:02)
sweatshirt (23:01 - 23:06)
I also need that incredibly bad well (23:02 - 23:08)
here's good on Christmas items do you (23:06 - 23:11)
have here's the the 200 IQ play Greg you (23:08 - 23:13)
put what you want in your cart and then (23:11 - 23:15)
when the train drops you add it you (23:13 - 23:17)
check out yeah I don't have that kind of (23:15 - 23:21)
money I'm assuming that this is my guess (23:17 - 23:23)
the train is gonna be $25 if you want (23:21 - 23:25)
the whole thing it's a hundred that'd be (23:23 - 23:29)
my dad do I guess hmm usually they are (23:25 - 23:33)
30 to 35 those things are expensive but (23:29 - 23:37)
they could be think I mean 25 isn't out (23:33 - 23:38)
of the ballpark I think it's a little (23:37 - 23:42)
low but what if you split that on your (23:38 - 23:44)
Christmas list and each of your friends (23:42 - 23:49)
brought you one of the cars they're (23:44 - 23:50)
instantly selling out on Monday there's (23:49 - 23:52)
not a doubt in my mind that this is (23:50 - 23:54)
what's gonna happen I'm gonna buy a (23:52 - 23:56)
train cart number one and then I'm going (23:54 - 23:58)
to sleep through train car number two (23:56 - 24:00)
and then I'm gonna get three or four and (23:58 - 24:02)
then I got a resort to eBay to spend (24:00 - 24:04)
like 80 dollars I'm trained card number (24:02 - 24:07)
two I have it's a hundred percent what's (24:04 - 24:10)
gonna happen yeah well I guess it gives (24:07 - 24:11)
me a reason to wake up early on Mondays (24:10 - 24:14)
yeah I mean I'm definitely looking and (24:11 - 24:16)
saying how much they are and deciding if (24:14 - 24:20)
I want it I'm just excited that the (24:16 - 24:23)
Pokemon ornaments that I bought back at (24:20 - 24:28)
Target in 1999 the fat Pikachu will once (24:23 - 24:31)
again be relevant girly yeah the (24:28 - 24:33)
ornament was the old sale Pikachu (24:31 - 24:35)

Collection it's like the six item oh no (24:44 - 24:49)
that's that's is ugly what about this (24:46 - 24:52)
what about the $50 holiday skirt so I (24:49 - 24:54)
would be tempted to get that except the (24:52 - 24:57)
dogs always attack that fringe and since (24:54 - 24:58)
it's on the ground because it's a skirt (24:57 - 25:02)
like all I do all holiday is get them (24:58 - 25:04)
away from the fuzz so that's a that's a (25:02 - 25:08)
no-go for me unfortunately I am very (25:04 - 25:12)
tempted by the chespin's Snowman which (25:08 - 25:15)
is beyond cute oh there that's been in (25:12 - 25:19)

have an Eevee ornament ornaments are my (25:37 - 25:41)
weakness like my Christmas tree is (25:40 - 25:44)

year like new to add and since I don't (25:44 - 25:50)
have a needy like I feel like ants have (25:47 - 25:53)
so they have to look that's also not (25:50 - 25:57)
that expensive ornament I mean depending (25:53 - 25:58)
what it's made out of it looks like it's (25:57 - 26:01)
made of which is ideal because then it (25:58 - 26:03)
won't fall and break as easily yeah (26:01 - 26:05)
because I have some very expensive (26:03 - 26:07)
ornaments that I'm like I I am so (26:05 - 26:09)
nervous putting that up every year cuz I (26:07 - 26:11)

than the power of us yeah well look (27:52 - 27:59)
that's not that's not a high bar okay (27:55 - 28:02)
I'm actually curious of what they'll do (27:59 - 28:04)
with this because just like how the (28:02 - 28:07)
three Reggie's are kind of required lore (28:04 - 28:10)
wise to summon regigigas the three in (28:07 - 28:14)
this trio are kind of part of the lore (28:10 - 28:18)
of Calvillo and how Calvillo wants to be (28:14 - 28:20)
part of the trio hence that movie that (28:18 - 28:22)
movie is literally focused on Calvillo (28:20 - 28:25)
trying to be part of the the musketeer (28:22 - 28:28)
trio and the ins name is in the name of (28:25 - 28:31)
the movie yes that being just things (28:28 - 28:33)
that makes things worse that being said (28:31 - 28:36)
they they did do an event which was I (28:33 - 28:39)
would say lore wise we talked about this (28:36 - 28:40)
on the show of like maybe they'll have (28:39 - 28:42)
an event where you kind of have to catch (28:40 - 28:43)
all three or have all three in your (28:42 - 28:45)
party in order to catch or I get (28:43 - 28:46)
regigigas and they pretty much did that (28:45 - 28:49)
this weekend I already know the answer (28:46 - 28:51)
but I'm gonna ask you as anyways did you (28:49 - 28:54)
participate in the regigigas colossal (28:51 - 28:56)
event (28:54 - 28:56)

okay so I spent the $8 excuse me (29:02 - 29:17)

I'm back to my old schedule of where I (29:25 - 29:30)

talked to the professor and he's like (29:39 - 29:47)
here's your first task and the way I (29:45 - 29:52)
looked at it was I thought they gave me (29:47 - 29:55)

rock pokémon and I did those uh-huh and (30:03 - 30:09)
I was like it's not going to the next (30:07 - 30:12)
step what's up and then I looked at it (30:09 - 30:15)
again and it was like you need to catch (30:12 - 30:18)
one of the Reggie's in a raid and I was (30:15 - 30:21)
like well I'm not going to be doing any (30:18 - 30:31)

the excitement that was the highlight of (31:04 - 31:05)
the day (31:05 - 31:09)
sure yeah her giving her getting a shiny (31:05 - 31:10)
was very (31:09 - 31:12)
forgetting the shiny she really wanted (31:10 - 31:13)
out of any shiny ever released in (31:12 - 31:16)
Pokemon history was was very exciting I (31:13 - 31:19)
was I was very happy that she walked (31:16 - 31:21)
away with a shiny Reggie Steele because (31:19 - 31:24)
that is top three of her favorite (31:21 - 31:25)
Pokemon all time (31:24 - 31:28)
so how many steps like how many steps (31:25 - 31:29)
were in the was it like the seven (31:28 - 31:31)
stepper was it a three stepper it's a (31:29 - 31:34)
four step so real quick just to (31:31 - 31:36)
piggyback off this Co Balian I can (31:34 - 31:38)
totally see them doing the regigigas (31:36 - 31:42)
event again in the future for whatever (31:38 - 31:45)
another eight dollars to get Keldeo (31:42 - 31:47)
we're to the point now in Pokemon go (31:45 - 31:49)
where there are too many mythical (31:47 - 31:51)
Pokemon or just too many legendary (31:49 - 31:53)
Pokemon in general in this case with (31:51 - 31:55)
regigigas because it was so tied to lore (31:53 - 31:58)
Wiis on the show you know a couple (31:55 - 31:59)
months ago said hey maybe they'll have (31:58 - 32:01)
Reggie's come back and you'll have to (31:59 - 32:03)
catch all three to get regigigas to show (32:01 - 32:05)
up and then we were like a that doesn't (32:03 - 32:06)
really make sense for a lot of people (32:05 - 32:08)
but they kind of did that technically I (32:06 - 32:10)
mean now that that event is over (32:08 - 32:13)
regigigas will appear in EAX raid so you (32:10 - 32:16)
won't have to require to do those said (32:13 - 32:18)
you don't need those said Reggie's to do (32:16 - 32:23)
that but the overall quest did did (32:18 - 32:25)
provide some flexibility so step one (32:23 - 32:28)
what what will said of it was it was (32:25 - 32:31)
evolved seven rock pokémon catch seven (32:28 - 32:35)
rock pokémon right yep and then it was (32:31 - 32:39)
catch either a Reggie rock out regice or (32:35 - 32:42)
a reggie steel if will would have done (32:39 - 32:46)
that last part quest to was catch seven (32:42 - 32:48)
steel pokémon or seven ice pokémon (32:46 - 32:50)
evolve seven eyes Pokemon and then again (32:48 - 32:54)
catch a Regirock a reggie ice regice or (32:50 - 32:56)
a reggie steel as you can guess (32:54 - 33:00)
number three is catch seven steel (32:56 - 33:02)
evolved seven steel and then catch a (33:00 - 33:05)
regice Reggie steel or Regirock witches (33:02 - 33:08)
so all in all you had to catch you had (33:05 - 33:11)
to do and complete and catch three (33:08 - 33:14)
Pokemon firm raids but it was nice in (33:11 - 33:16)
the sense that oh like I keep seeing reg (33:14 - 33:18)
I sent but I really need a Reggie Steele (33:16 - 33:22)
the final quest was the (33:18 - 33:25)
take a picture of all three of them so (33:22 - 33:26)
even though you you could do three (33:25 - 33:29)
regice the final quest required you to (33:26 - 33:32)
take a picture of a regice then a reggie (33:29 - 33:34)
steel then a reggie rock and then (33:32 - 33:37)
regigigas will show up so I thought like (33:34 - 33:41)
overall the the quest was good if you're (33:37 - 33:43)
a hardcore player of the game you (33:41 - 33:46)
probably could have evolved seven rock (33:43 - 33:48)
pokémon seven steal pokémon and seven (33:46 - 33:50)
nice Pokemon right away if you were not (33:48 - 33:52)
a hardcore player you would have spent a (33:50 - 33:54)
little more time catching those fields (33:52 - 33:57)
or catching those airons or catching (33:54 - 34:00)
those geodude's and they were plentiful (33:57 - 34:03)
but you know you have to catch with pin (34:00 - 34:05)
app you know four or five evolve one (34:03 - 34:08)
catch another four or five evolve one so (34:05 - 34:13)
it was pretty easy and I think well (34:08 - 34:15)
paced for somebody who maybe doesn't (34:13 - 34:18)
play pokemon go a lot but also not like (34:15 - 34:21)
annoying to the aspect of you know maybe (34:18 - 34:23)
a hardcore player who probably didn't (34:21 - 34:24)
really care about the quest line they (34:23 - 34:27)
just more so wanted the the rewards I (34:24 - 34:29)
suppose I mean I wanted the rewards but (34:27 - 34:33)
they're variable yeah but also I can (34:29 - 34:37)
like in the future do this right it's (34:33 - 34:38)
yeah yeah I'm away from me just because (34:37 - 34:40)
I'm out of the time the only requirement (34:38 - 34:42)
for the time was like that you buy the (34:40 - 34:47)
pass during that time yes so yeah you (34:42 - 34:50)
know down the line we will see no (34:47 - 34:52)
shortage of read the Reggie's coming (34:50 - 34:57)
back and being recycled I think though (34:52 - 35:02)
for the $8 I think so I guess so for the (34:57 - 35:05)
$8 I would say it was worth it I went to (35:02 - 35:08)
a brand new place that I've never played (35:05 - 35:11)
Pokemon go which can always go either (35:08 - 35:14)
very good or very poorly I would say (35:11 - 35:15)
what neither I would say wasn't the best (35:14 - 35:16)
place to play it wasn't the worst place (35:15 - 35:20)
to play in Milwaukee there wasn't a good (35:16 - 35:24)
place outside that would have raids and (35:20 - 35:26)
stops that didn't require me walking (35:24 - 35:29)
around in 34 degree weather Fahrenheit a (35:26 - 35:33)
couple things that they did I think (35:29 - 35:35)
I have the expectation and I think a lot (35:33 - 35:37)
of people also had the expectation that (35:35 - 35:40)
this would feel like a community day and (35:37 - 35:42)
what I mean by that is that there will (35:40 - 35:44)
be increased number of spawns of the (35:42 - 35:46)
Pokemon they said they were going to (35:44 - 35:47)
feature which would have been like (35:46 - 35:51)
Geodude Erin spheal and they talked (35:47 - 35:54)
about Skarmory being finally shiny and (35:51 - 35:58)
that when you pay the $7.99 you'll get (35:54 - 36:00)
your 10 rate passes you'll get your pose (35:58 - 36:03)
you'll get your regigigas you'll get (36:00 - 36:07)
special quest and there will be more (36:03 - 36:10)
raids for everyone to do not (36:07 - 36:12)
specifically to pass holders the only (36:10 - 36:13)
thing that pass holder is getting (36:12 - 36:16)
besides the free raid passes in the pose (36:13 - 36:17)
and the metal and the regigigas (36:16 - 36:20)
guarantee but what's the pose I don't (36:17 - 36:21)
know it look kind of looks like you're (36:20 - 36:23)
flossing it's not particularly good oh (36:21 - 36:25)
I'm glad it it paid back for that then (36:23 - 36:28)
the the thing that the pass holders were (36:25 - 36:31)
specifically getting was unique quest (36:28 - 36:33)
and those new knee quests were you know (36:31 - 36:35)
battle a friend trade with a friend add (36:33 - 36:39)
a new friend or complete a raid and when (36:35 - 36:40)
you did that you would either got like (36:39 - 36:45)
an Aerodactyl a Skarmory chuckle or (36:40 - 36:45)
something else that could be shiny or (36:46 - 36:52)
sought-after the ball I went to had (36:49 - 36:54)
about 19 stops so that was nineteen (36:52 - 36:55)
chances I guess of getting a shiny (36:54 - 36:58)
Skarmory spoiler I didn't get one and (36:55 - 37:02)
there were seven gems there although one (36:58 - 37:04)
seemed to be e.x blocked so it was never (37:02 - 37:07)
popping up a gym but what was nice is (37:04 - 37:10)
instead of these being tier five tier v (37:07 - 37:11)
raids they ended up being tier fours and (37:10 - 37:14)
the instead of having like a you know (37:11 - 37:17)
230 or whatever the default timer is for (37:14 - 37:20)
a tier 5 they had a 300 second timer so (37:17 - 37:23)
it was very easy to have three people at (37:20 - 37:25)
minimum be able to do these and kind of (37:23 - 37:27)
move on to the next was nice and what (37:25 - 37:29)
was really cool is once you completed it (37:27 - 37:31)
about 20 minutes after that rate was (37:29 - 37:32)
complete another raid would start (37:31 - 37:34)
queuing up again and they would have 15 (37:32 - 37:37)
minute timers not 45 minute timers you (37:34 - 37:39)
complete a raid that raid finally (37:37 - 37:41)
expires about 20 minutes later a 15 (37:39 - 37:43)
timer pops so it was very easy once you (37:41 - 37:45)
got to one end of the mall being like oh (37:43 - 37:46)
and (37:45 - 37:47)
nine minutes we're gonna be able to do (37:46 - 37:50)
another Regirock over here so we'll just (37:47 - 37:52)
walk back I think there was some (37:50 - 37:53)
disappointment that this wasn't a (37:52 - 37:56)
community today as in your I like there (37:53 - 38:01)
were no special shininess for for like (37:56 - 38:03)
you didn't get it increased shininess (38:01 - 38:05)
for swine up or Geodude which I think (38:03 - 38:08)
did bum out people so instead of feeling (38:05 - 38:10)
like a community today it almost felt (38:08 - 38:11)
like one of those raid hours like the (38:10 - 38:13)
Gengar or the Articuno or the laughter (38:11 - 38:16)
it felt like that but instead of you (38:13 - 38:18)
know you doing a random moving on that (38:16 - 38:20)
raid will reap Appa get in a little bit (38:18 - 38:23)
so I think there was some expect to and (38:20 - 38:25)
to be fair to be completely fair in (38:23 - 38:26)
antic never said there was going to be (38:25 - 38:29)
increased Chinese or anything like that (38:26 - 38:31)
or increased spawns for ticket holders (38:29 - 38:33)
they did say there would be an increased (38:31 - 38:35)
amount of raids and they did deliver on (38:33 - 38:36)
this so I don't know if this falls into (38:35 - 38:38)
the Department of people setting their (38:36 - 38:39)
own expectations and being disappointed (38:38 - 38:44)
by that as you know paying $7 $7.99 for (38:39 - 38:47)
what I consider it to be like a raid a (38:44 - 38:51)
like Lapras or Articuno or Gengar the (38:47 - 38:52)
difference is instead of being three (38:51 - 38:55)
hours it was eight hours and a lot of (38:52 - 38:58)
people vocally said they wish these days (38:55 - 39:00)
were longer because they might not they (38:58 - 39:01)
might be at work during the three hour (39:00 - 39:05)
period so I think it did accomplish that (39:01 - 39:08)
and I guess it bone added on bonus (39:05 - 39:12)
quests that you could do to get a chance (39:08 - 39:15)
for a shiny Skarmory but it didn't feel (39:12 - 39:18)
like a go fest it did not feel like a (39:15 - 39:21)
safari zone and it did not feel like a (39:18 - 39:23)
community today the closest thing I (39:21 - 39:25)
could say that it felt to was like the (39:23 - 39:28)
Lapras Gengar Articuno thing that for (39:25 - 39:30)
the most part people seem to like those (39:28 - 39:33)
but overall long story short too long (39:30 - 39:37)
didn't read $8.00 to me is nothing (39:33 - 39:39)
because when I get a meal at five guys (39:37 - 39:41)
or at Burger King like that is usually (39:39 - 39:45)
about nine to eleven dollars I felt like (39:41 - 39:46)
I walked away with some enjoyment of (39:45 - 39:49)
what I did I would have done more than (39:46 - 39:53)
ten raids anyways so I got ten passes (39:49 - 39:57)
for $8 I got a free pose which normally (39:53 - 39:59)
is five dollars I guess I got (39:57 - 40:02)
a medal which means literally nothing (39:59 - 40:05)
but it was cool to look at I suppose and (40:02 - 40:07)
I thought the you know the I thought the (40:05 - 40:09)
question was fun I thought like doing (40:07 - 40:10)
the like things in a row even though it (40:09 - 40:12)
took me 90 minutes or so I thought it (40:10 - 40:15)
was fun I liked it was the good reason (40:12 - 40:16)
to get out of the house and play pokemon (40:15 - 40:19)
go and walk away with a regigigas so I (40:16 - 40:22)
don't really feel burned but at the same (40:19 - 40:25)
time I if you didn't do it I don't feel (40:22 - 40:29)
like you missed anything so if you (40:25 - 40:30)
partially did it you didn't miss (40:29 - 40:31)
anything (40:30 - 40:33)
yeah so it's like hard to recommend (40:31 - 40:36)
would I like pay for another event in (40:33 - 40:38)
the future yeah probably because I like (40:36 - 40:40)
I said I don't think I don't think they (40:38 - 40:42)
like screwed me on cost but at the same (40:40 - 40:44)
time I didn't think it was particularly (40:42 - 40:47)
exciting I think what we'll learn from (40:44 - 40:49)
this just like the first time they did (40:47 - 40:52)
what was that it was like the it was it (40:49 - 40:55)
was Phoebus everyone hated Phoebus and (40:52 - 40:57)
then they made it better what client Pro (40:55 - 40:58)
came out I would only assume that (40:57 - 41:00)
they're going to probably make it a (40:58 - 41:02)
little bit better I don't know what that (41:00 - 41:02)
is (41:02 - 41:05)
and I think that's the important talking (41:02 - 41:08)
point I eat because if if people were (41:05 - 41:10)
expecting like SHINee rates to be (41:08 - 41:12)
boosted because they paid $8 at what (41:10 - 41:16)
line are we drawing for knee antic to (41:12 - 41:19)
charge us to increase our luck like a (41:16 - 41:22)
shiny charm but I guess you could argue (41:19 - 41:30)
that for go fast but at this yeah yeah (41:22 - 41:32)
there's a level of value that they have (41:30 - 41:35)
to wait right like the fact that you (41:32 - 41:38)
even though it was you know eight hours (41:35 - 41:40)
that day and you didn't have to do all (41:38 - 41:43)
eight I only did six I think there is (41:40 - 41:45)
sort of like was I getting the value out (41:43 - 41:49)
of spending that money because like you (41:45 - 41:50)
can say well I would have spent that (41:49 - 41:53)
money on food but you need to you need (41:50 - 42:01)
food like nobody's buying and like there (41:53 - 42:05)
is a level of okay (42:01 - 42:10)
what what did I get $8 worth of value (42:05 - 42:12)
out of this event and I think that's (42:10 - 42:14)
gonna be very I think that will vary a (42:12 - 42:18)
lot between each person obviously like (42:14 - 42:20)
if they saw it but I think people who (42:18 - 42:22)
thought oh this should be like a regular (42:20 - 42:26)
community day and didn't get that like (42:22 - 42:28)
that wouldn't have been a hard thing to (42:26 - 42:33)
do for $8 for a large event that sort of (42:28 - 42:38)
celebrated the reggie's so I get that a (42:33 - 42:40)
little bit like (42:38 - 42:41)
although I would I don't know what a (42:40 - 42:43)
better value looks like like I don't (42:41 - 42:47)
know what that is so here's what I was (42:43 - 42:48)
thinking actually because I I kind of (42:47 - 42:52)
saw this go around there was the I can't (42:48 - 42:53)
remember was physically called it was (42:52 - 42:54)
like the welcome back thing that they (42:53 - 42:57)
did the questline I might actually still (42:54 - 43:02)
have it active here it was called you (42:57 - 43:03)
had the one who like jumpstart peep (43:02 - 43:04)
jumpstart research (43:03 - 43:06)
so the jumpstart research was do you (43:04 - 43:08)
know help people get back to the Pokemon (43:06 - 43:09)
go give them a lot of Stardust give them (43:08 - 43:11)
some candy you know let them get like a (43:09 - 43:14)
dragon knight pretty easily that quest (43:11 - 43:17)
line guaranteed you a free shiny Eevee (43:14 - 43:19)
there I think we've said this about (43:17 - 43:21)
community days and stuff before where (43:19 - 43:22)
some people who are like this event was (43:21 - 43:25)
amazing because I got X amount of (43:22 - 43:27)
Chinese or this event sucked because I (43:25 - 43:29)
didn't get any Chinese a lot of people (43:27 - 43:31)
judge their their their days like that (43:29 - 43:35)
which I mean is your everyone has a (43:31 - 43:39)
different enjoyment in Pokemon go but if (43:35 - 43:40)
the questline (43:39 - 43:43)
maybe maybe guaranteed you a shiny (43:40 - 43:47)
Skarmory I think people probably would (43:43 - 43:49)
have walked away pretty positive and (43:47 - 43:51)
before anyone was like well they (43:49 - 43:53)
shouldn't be handing out free Chinese (43:51 - 43:57)
why they yeah they did like why do they (43:53 - 43:59)
do it all the time for the main series (43:57 - 44:03)
game right now you can go to Game Stop (43:59 - 44:05)
and get a shiny Lu Nala (44:03 - 44:08)
or so Gallio who thanks for the reminder (44:05 - 44:10)
Gregg when are we going I don't know (44:08 - 44:13)
when you want to go and I don't I don't (44:10 - 44:17)
really see it as paying for I mean I (44:13 - 44:19)
guess you could say like you're paying (44:17 - 44:21)
for a shiny but you're paying for an (44:19 - 44:24)
event is we're just sort of be like what (44:21 - 44:26)
my line is I don't want to pay for a (44:24 - 44:28)
shiny it's like but like if you're (44:26 - 44:31)
paying seven dollars just for the shiny (44:28 - 44:33)
isn't that more like on you instead of (44:31 - 44:34)
like the thing there are they're (44:33 - 44:36)
offering you an experience and (44:34 - 44:39)
experiences cost money you could pay (44:36 - 44:43)
seven dollars to go to a water park or (44:39 - 44:45)
you could sit in your bathtub and watch (44:43 - 44:48)
turn turn on (44:45 - 44:48)
scary water parks are you going to Steve (44:51 - 44:57)
must be $20 to go to the zoo last night (44:54 - 44:59)
and look at pumpkins (44:57 - 45:01)
Steve's backyard waterpark seven bucks (44:59 - 45:04)
come on down it's a slip and slide (45:01 - 45:10)
it's November I had a pilot dig a hole (45:04 - 45:12)
in my backyard I've put a waterslide (45:10 - 45:18)
back there why did it go up a dollar (45:12 - 45:24)
yeah eight bucks enough shiny guaranteed (45:18 - 45:26)
to be on street okay here we go here we (45:24 - 45:32)
go come Dusty's backyard barbecue I got (45:26 - 45:34)
out serve you up some yard barbecue and (45:32 - 45:36)
slip and slide yes sir you have (45:34 - 45:41)
something ribs ribs back I think the (45:36 - 45:43)
McRib is back if anything from this (45:41 - 45:46)
podcast one go to gamestop get yourself (45:43 - 45:49)
a shiny so go Leo and I know a bad (45:46 - 45:50)
Chinese go ahead and stop at McDonald's (45:49 - 45:53)
get your McRib and then come my way (45:50 - 45:57)
she's man bye Steve's $7.00 waterparks (45:53 - 46:01)
dude super sketch $7.00 water by you (45:57 - 46:06)
insurance I it's like the same argument (46:01 - 46:10)
as the pokeball Plus where some people (46:06 - 46:13)
see that as a $50 Moo and I don't agree (46:10 - 46:17)
with those people because one there's (46:13 - 46:19)
multiple ways to get in you and there (46:17 - 46:21)
has been for 20-some years (46:19 - 46:24)
heck if for whatever reason if you still (46:21 - 46:26)
had my Pokemon ranch on your Nintendo (46:24 - 46:29)
Wii sitting in your parents basement (46:26 - 46:32)
get yourself a limited amounts of news (46:29 - 46:35)
because that because it just literally (46:32 - 46:37)
spits out unlimited muse so if you're (46:35 - 46:38)
looking at the pokeball plus and you're (46:37 - 46:41)
saying I'm paying $50 for mu-1 there's (46:38 - 46:43)
other ways to get me there will always (46:41 - 46:45)
be more ways to get Mew in the future (46:43 - 46:48)
but you're paying for a controller that (46:45 - 46:51)
works like a joy con and joy comes with (46:48 - 46:53)
$40 you're paying for something that (46:51 - 46:56)
also has the compatibility of a pokeball (46:53 - 46:59)
plus or a Pokemon Pokemon go Plus which (46:56 - 47:01)
is 35 (46:59 - 47:03)
and you're getting a mu and you're (47:01 - 47:05)
getting a device that works with two (47:03 - 47:07)
Pokemon games let's go Eevee (47:05 - 47:08)
and let's go Pikachu and sword and (47:07 - 47:11)
shield that when you put a Pokemon on (47:08 - 47:13)
set device it will give you rewards into (47:11 - 47:16)
your game so for me I never see I know I (47:13 - 47:19)
poke a walker and the best part it's a (47:16 - 47:22)
polka Walker so I've never saw that as (47:19 - 47:25)
English I never saw that as a $50 mu I (47:22 - 47:29)
saw that as a controller and a pokeball (47:25 - 47:32)
plus with added features so you could (47:29 - 47:34)
look at an event like the regigigas (47:32 - 47:36)
event and if they offered a free shiny (47:34 - 47:38)
you would have some people look at that (47:36 - 47:43)
as a $7 shiny but I would look at it as (47:38 - 47:45)
unexperienced that I'm doing with (47:43 - 47:49)
friends where I'm getting regigigas and (47:45 - 47:52)
I am doing a quest line and I am getting (47:49 - 47:54)
Stardust and I am getting experience and (47:52 - 47:57)
I'm getting I am doing something I guess (47:54 - 48:00)
I don't know I just don't I think that (47:57 - 48:02)
like offering a shiny isn't outside of (48:00 - 48:04)
what has been offered in both Pokemon go (48:02 - 48:08)
and the main series stuff I don't know (48:04 - 48:11)
if that makes it a better value or more (48:08 - 48:14)
enticing it was the first time they did (48:11 - 48:16)
this so there's plenty of room for (48:14 - 48:19)
improvement right as is I don't think I (48:16 - 48:23)
wasted my money but I mean some people (48:19 - 48:25)
might feel like they they did I thought (48:23 - 48:26)
it was okay though I didn't think it was (48:25 - 48:28)
great I just thought it was like okay (48:26 - 48:31)
sure we did it it was something to do on (48:28 - 48:33)
a Saturday afternoon safer than your (48:31 - 48:36)
water park a straight answer so the one (48:33 - 48:40)
thing if if like Niantic came to me and (48:36 - 48:43)
said will anderson we noticed that you (48:40 - 48:45)
spent the $8 and you didn't even get (48:43 - 48:48)
past the first step what what could we (48:45 - 48:50)
do to improve the experience for you so (48:48 - 48:51)
that you would have it gotten more out (48:50 - 48:55)
of it I would say please offer like even (48:51 - 48:57)
if you have to offer two tickets right (48:55 - 49:00)
offer one ticket for people who like to (48:57 - 49:03)
do raids and do the social aspects of (49:00 - 49:05)
Pokemon go and then offer another ticket (49:03 - 49:07)
that's like you can completely do this (49:05 - 49:10)
solo and maybe make it harder or (49:07 - 49:12)
something like you have to catch more (49:10 - 49:14)
Pokemon or do something like that (49:12 - 49:15)
but give me an option that does not (49:14 - 49:21)
involve raids because I just the I don't (49:15 - 49:23)
have the time and effort for it not (49:21 - 49:27)
I mean misanthropic reasons aside for (49:23 - 49:29)
people who are in rural areas who don't (49:27 - 49:32)
have access to raids it would be nice to (49:29 - 49:34)
have that option for them to participate (49:32 - 49:38)
so I support the idea for that reason (49:34 - 49:42)
like that you know it's hard for people (49:38 - 49:45)
who live in sparse areas are on salami (49:42 - 49:47)
island who don't have access to full (49:45 - 49:49)
race but you know it's like I have (49:47 - 49:51)
tremendous compassion now for those (49:49 - 49:55)
people because like in DC I could walk (49:51 - 49:59)
from my house I could do a 1.5 mile walk (49:55 - 50:02)
just around my neighborhood and hit 20 (49:59 - 50:06)
pokey stops I took a 6 mile walk (50:02 - 50:09)
yesterday from my house through st. Paul (50:06 - 50:12)
in back and I didn't even hit 10 you (50:09 - 50:20)
know I say Paul or find and gentle folk (50:12 - 50:25)
yeah but they feel bad for you because (50:20 - 50:27)
you're literally 15 minutes away from (50:25 - 50:30)
the best place to play pokemon go (50:27 - 50:34)
indoors in the entire world and you're (50:30 - 50:39)
on the light rail like I mean maybe it's (50:34 - 50:42)
true that like Disney World is a better (50:39 - 50:44)
place to play pokemon go pensive but (50:42 - 50:47)
that's outside (50:44 - 50:49)
in the hot Sun I'm just saying I am (50:47 - 50:52)
technically in a city of a similar size (50:49 - 50:56)
to DC but even here there are not as (50:52 - 50:58)
many pokey stops as there are in DC so (50:56 - 51:00)
for somebody who's in a rural area I can (50:58 - 51:02)
imagine it's even worse yes this event (51:00 - 51:05)
was nice though that in you know instead (51:02 - 51:08)
of like the Gengar a day you do that one (51:05 - 51:10)
gang guard now that gym is expired for (51:08 - 51:12)
the rest of the three hours in this case (51:10 - 51:15)
in a couple minutes after the raid is (51:12 - 51:16)
complete it's going to spawn another (51:15 - 51:20)
raid so for people in rural areas as (51:16 - 51:24)
long as your gym wasn't an e^x gym that (51:20 - 51:27)
was getting blocked because of how es (51:24 - 51:30)
gyms block out for the entire day you (51:27 - 51:32)
probably would have seen six to eight (51:30 - 51:34)
raids in the eight hours at that same (51:32 - 51:36)
gym pop over and over and over again (51:34 - 51:39)
which in that case that you just stand (51:36 - 51:41)
around it and wait for the next yeah and (51:39 - 51:43)
I wish I had known that because there's (51:41 - 51:46)
actually a gym that you can reach if you (51:43 - 51:48)
just stand in the right corner of my (51:46 - 51:51)
building yes true but I mean I'm not (51:48 - 51:54)
like I wasn't super super disappointed (51:51 - 51:57)
but there's there is a high ceiling of (51:54 - 51:59)
improvement that Nanta can hit with (51:57 - 52:03)
future events of these and I think we (51:59 - 52:05)
said like two three weeks ago that we we (52:03 - 52:08)
ultimately think that these will kind of (52:05 - 52:12)
replace Pokemon go fest in the in the (52:08 - 52:14)
iteration of this weekend (52:12 - 52:17)
not even close and I still think we'll (52:14 - 52:20)
probably get more Pokemon go fest into (52:17 - 52:22)
2020 but I think once they find the (52:20 - 52:25)
right balance of what they want a player (52:22 - 52:29)
to do for how long for how much I think (52:25 - 52:31)
that ultimately this will make more (52:29 - 52:34)
money than a go fest will ever do for (52:31 - 52:36)
them which is not particularly good for (52:34 - 52:40)
us but I know they listen to what people (52:36 - 52:44)
do or do not want in Pokemon go (52:40 - 52:44)
[Music] (52:44 - 52:48)
Hey hello hi how are you (52:51 - 52:58)
SP J here normally there's a musical (52:55 - 53:01)
break but of course it is the beginning (52:58 - 53:03)
of the month which means that I take a (53:01 - 53:07)
couple seconds of this episode please (53:03 - 53:10)
tell you that this is my full-time job (53:07 - 53:12)
podcasting and creating content on (53:10 - 53:15)
Twitch or how I pay my bills that's not (53:12 - 53:18)
what it used to be but I've been doing (53:15 - 53:20)
it for about two years now actually - (53:18 - 53:22)
you're strong so I'm able to do that (53:20 - 53:25)
because of listeners who support on (53:22 - 53:28)
patreon I know that most podcasts have (53:25 - 53:32)
some sort of patron spiel shree shree (53:28 - 53:36)
just feel like the pokemon that evolves (53:32 - 53:38)
into walrein that there's a middle (53:36 - 53:39)
evolution in there somewhere (53:38 - 53:42)
anyways we tried not to do we try not to (53:39 - 53:44)
promote the patreon too much I can get (53:42 - 53:46)
annoying so I try to do just a little (53:44 - 53:49)
bit of a thing the first of the month (53:46 - 53:53)
but revamped I will slightly change some (53:49 - 53:54)
of the patreon rewards so if you haven't (53:53 - 53:55)
checked it out in the past six months (53:54 - 53:58)
might be a good idea to check it out but (53:55 - 54:00)
if you're curious what it is patreon is (53:58 - 54:02)
a website that you can sign up for and (54:00 - 54:04)
you can set it for like one dollar a (54:02 - 54:06)
month or two dollars a month or five (54:04 - 54:07)
dollars a month and then that money (54:06 - 54:11)
helps support me but for $2 a month you (54:07 - 54:13)
get access to our slack community which (54:11 - 54:17)
has a ton of active people very nice (54:13 - 54:19)
I've been told they tell me to get they (54:17 - 54:21)
yell at me they say hey you need to (54:19 - 54:23)
promote the slack more because everyone (54:21 - 54:25)
here is really nice and really great so (54:23 - 54:26)
if you're looking for trainers (54:25 - 54:27)
especially with pokemon sword and (54:26 - 54:29)
Pokemon shield coming up that you want (54:27 - 54:30)
to trade with battle with talk with (54:29 - 54:33)
laughs with cry with you might consider (54:30 - 54:37)
checking out the patreon is e dot Cash (54:33 - 54:41)
or the long way patreon.com slash it's (54:37 - 54:44)
super effective or the easy way just (54:41 - 54:46)
looking in your show notes in your (54:44 - 54:47)
podcast app and then clicking the little (54:46 - 54:49)
button that says support on patreon all (54:47 - 54:52)
three of those ways work and it's a (54:49 - 54:54)
pretty easy way to support the show if (54:52 - 54:57)
you want to support at a higher tier you (54:54 - 54:59)
can get out my Pokemon go friendslist if (54:57 - 55:01)

tons of rewards for different ways if (55:13 - 55:18)
you want to support if you can't afford (55:15 - 55:20)
to that's something I'd be financially (55:18 - 55:22)

[Music] (56:20 - 56:27)
and we are back from our break we are (56:23 - 56:30)
here with real break-in Nate how are you (56:27 - 56:33)
man I'm doing good it's I'm a little (56:30 - 56:35)
nervous to be on the podcast because I'm (56:33 - 56:39)
a big fan and so I don't want to make a (56:35 - 56:42)
fool of myself well thank you I (56:39 - 56:44)
appreciate it this is this is funny cuz (56:42 - 56:47)
we've been trying to plan this for since (56:44 - 56:49)
Pokemon go fest I think at this point (56:47 - 56:52)
yeah which was what that was (56:49 - 56:53)
when was Pokemon go past that end of (56:52 - 56:56)
early August central end of July I can't (56:53 - 57:03)
remember exam two and weird weird story (56:56 - 57:06)
real fast of how we met there I was with (57:03 - 57:09)
super duper Danny another Pokemon (57:06 - 57:13)
content creator and she had tweeted out (57:09 - 57:16)
that she was there and and then I (57:13 - 57:18)
started to like freak out a little bit (57:16 - 57:19)
because I was like oh my god how did how (57:18 - 57:21)
does he know you how does he know you (57:19 - 57:22)
and you were talking about like meeting (57:21 - 57:24)
up and I'm like oh my god Danny you have (57:22 - 57:26)
to reply back like right now we have to (57:24 - 57:27)
go meet up with him because I wanted to (57:26 - 57:33)
meet you really really bad yeah I do I (57:27 - 57:35)
do remember this I remember how I like (57:33 - 57:39)
discovered Danny either but yeah well (57:35 - 57:41)
it's a small world sometimes right right (57:39 - 57:44)
that's crazy that's crazy and I and she (57:41 - 57:46)
could never mentioned that she had kind (57:44 - 57:47)
of like new you so it was just a very (57:46 - 57:49)
spur of the moment and I was like (57:47 - 57:51)
hardcore listening to your podcast (57:49 - 57:53)
though but yeah here we are here we are (57:51 - 57:57)
for for my listeners who are you I guess (57:53 - 58:01)
I your name is Nate obviously in your (57:57 - 58:04)
name of your YouTube channel but who are (58:01 - 58:06)
you for listeners I mean that's a good (58:04 - 58:08)
question because I'm still trying to (58:06 - 58:10)
figure out who I am but I go by real (58:08 - 58:13)
breaking Nate on YouTube and all the (58:10 - 58:16)
social media platforms but I do I do (58:13 - 58:19)
Pokemon content and I mix it with like (58:16 - 58:21)
my family life and just kind of what's (58:19 - 58:24)
going on in my world so I guess most (58:21 - 58:26)
people would consider me a Pokemon (58:24 - 58:28)
channel but I just kind of consider (58:26 - 58:32)
myself more of just kind of like um I (58:28 - 58:35)
don't know just like a vlogger (58:32 - 58:39)
that sense yeah but but there's Pokemon (58:35 - 58:42)
in it yeah but obviously I mean if the (58:39 - 58:44)
underlying and the undertone is it's a (58:42 - 58:46)
Pokemon channel but it's a very unique (58:44 - 58:49)
take of including like my wife and my (58:46 - 58:51)
dog in the channel and just like you (58:49 - 58:53)
know what's going on in our lives like (58:51 - 58:56)
that and then there's Pokemon as well so (58:53 - 58:58)
you know in it it's it's my full-time (58:56 - 59:01)
and my full-time I hate calling it a job (58:58 - 59:04)
because I doesn't feel like a job to me (59:01 - 59:07)
but it is my full-time job technically (59:04 - 59:09)
okay okay (59:07 - 59:11)
before we kind of get to the I guess the (59:09 - 59:15)
job part of things yeah (59:11 - 59:18)
why specifically like Pokemon I'm (59:15 - 59:19)
assuming there was like one point in (59:18 - 59:21)
your life where Pokemon grabbed your (59:19 - 59:23)
attention whether that was like the TCG (59:21 - 59:25)
or the anime or the video game or the (59:23 - 59:28)
merchandise it's really just the whole (59:25 - 59:31)
so I've always been a collector of just (59:28 - 59:33)
things in general so I've always (59:31 - 59:36)
collected something in my life I (59:33 - 59:39)
remember my parents used to take we used (59:36 - 59:41)
to go on the weekends to antique stores (59:39 - 59:43)
all the time and I absolutely hated it (59:41 - 59:47)
and in order to enjoy it I started to (59:43 - 59:49)
collect things from antique stores so (59:47 - 59:52)
I've just always been a collector (59:49 - 59:54)
mindset and then when Pokemon came about (59:52 - 59:58)
in the 90s the whole motto is got to (59:54 - 59:59)
collect them all you know gotta catch (59:58 - 60:00)
them all and got to collect everything (59:59 - 60:05)
so that really like spoke to me like a (60:00 - 60:07)
whole new level like the whole motto is (60:05 - 60:08)
you know you've got to collect (60:07 - 60:11)
everything so I've been a fan since the (60:08 - 60:15)
90s since it first came out and yeah I (60:11 - 60:17)
know I played I played red and blue when (60:15 - 60:19)
it first came out I loved it I loved the (60:17 - 60:20)
video games but there's just something (60:19 - 60:24)
about the card game that just I have no (60:20 - 60:27)
idea just makes me extremely extremely (60:24 - 60:30)
happy like there's no extravagant answer (60:27 - 60:33)
behind it but the card game just makes (60:30 - 60:35)
me so happy because every time you open (60:33 - 60:36)
up a booster pack it's just like this a (60:35 - 60:39)
big mystery like what is inside this (60:36 - 60:40)
booster pack is gonna be something (60:39 - 60:41)
really really good or is it something (60:40 - 60:44)
that I've pulled you know ten times now (60:41 - 60:45)
I don't know there's just I just it (60:44 - 60:48)
makes me happy that's just there's no (60:45 - 60:50)
big answer to it you know I'm not trying (60:48 - 60:52)
to you know give you something some (60:50 - 60:54)
crazy extravagant answer it's just it (60:52 - 60:55)
makes me happy (60:54 - 60:57)
sure did you also like suffer the same (60:55 - 60:59)
thing as most ninety kids where you like (60:57 - 61:00)
fell out of Pokemon for like two or (60:59 - 61:02)
three years and then came back oh I (61:00 - 61:05)
would be lying if I said I didn't I (61:02 - 61:08)
didn't completely fall out you know you (61:05 - 61:11)
kind of hit that face to where you start (61:08 - 61:13)
to I mean obviously you're growing up as (61:11 - 61:16)
as a person and you know you're (61:13 - 61:18)
discovering new things you're trying to (61:16 - 61:21)
figure out who you are I think I was in (61:18 - 61:24)
I think I was in 4th or 5th grade when (61:21 - 61:26)
Pokemon hit the United States and it's (61:24 - 61:28)
so kinda as you start to grow up you (61:26 - 61:30)
know you start to learn about other (61:28 - 61:32)
things and you get interested in other (61:30 - 61:35)
things and Pokemon wasn't as prominent (61:32 - 61:37)
in my life but it was I was still a fan (61:35 - 61:39)
of it I was still buying stuff and (61:37 - 61:41)
things like that but I did have that (61:39 - 61:45)
period where it was like you know I was (61:41 - 61:46)
getting in other things like I just (61:45 - 61:49)
gotten into wrestling - so I was (61:46 - 61:50)
watching on wrestling and buying (61:49 - 61:53)
wrestling stuff but that was wrestling (61:50 - 61:57)
TCG cards did you play that game no no (61:53 - 61:59)
no no I didn't I I wanted them though (61:57 - 62:01)
cuz the wrestling came out (61:59 - 62:03)
yeah wrestling was like my thing after (62:01 - 62:05)
Pokemon for a hot minute and so the (62:03 - 62:07)
natural transition was like I had (62:05 - 62:09)
pokemon cards and there's like these (62:07 - 62:11)
wrestling cards at Target but my parents (62:09 - 62:12)
would never get them for me (62:11 - 62:15)
I think it was just kind of like the 90s (62:12 - 62:16)
thing you know I mean so like you're a (62:15 - 62:19)
kid and you just kind of grab on to (62:16 - 62:20)
whatever's popular at the time (62:19 - 62:22)
I feel like Pokemon was popular and then (62:20 - 62:24)
wrestling had its big boom in the late (62:22 - 62:28)
90s so everybody was into wrestling and (62:24 - 62:32)
and then I I think at the end of the day (62:28 - 62:33)
you kind of circle back around to what (62:32 - 62:35)
really makes you happy and at the end of (62:33 - 62:39)
the day you know years later it's still (62:35 - 62:40)
Pokemon that's making me happy and stuck (62:39 - 62:41)
around yeah (62:40 - 62:43)
wrestling fan not so much but I mean I (62:41 - 62:46)
still am but not as hardcore as it was (62:43 - 62:51)
totally from Pokemon too you know living (62:46 - 62:52)
your life and then coming back to (62:51 - 62:55)
Pokemon was that also the same time you (62:52 - 62:57)
decided to get into content creation or (62:55 - 62:59)
was that like totally different because (62:57 - 63:02)
for me specifically I felt (62:59 - 63:04)
out of Pokemon like most people did in (63:02 - 63:05)
like middle school and maybe like the (63:04 - 63:07)
start of high school and then I got back (63:05 - 63:09)
in with diamond and pearl and then it (63:07 - 63:12)
wasn't until our cold soul silverware I (63:09 - 63:14)
thought to myself like I want to make (63:12 - 63:18)
content because there's a lack of one of (63:14 - 63:19)
my case podcast there was there was a (63:18 - 63:22)
four or five podcast in iTunes and and (63:19 - 63:25)
three of them haven't didn't post an (63:22 - 63:27)
episode for you know years and then two (63:25 - 63:30)
of them they did post episodes but it (63:27 - 63:31)
was like once a month and I was like I (63:30 - 63:34)
need like a weekly show I'm gonna make (63:31 - 63:35)
it myself (63:34 - 63:38)
consistency is key so was that was that (63:35 - 63:40)
for you like you circled back to Pokemon (63:38 - 63:42)
and then you were like I want to feel (63:40 - 63:44)
some void or was it like I'm already (63:42 - 63:46)
making content and I want to add Pokemon (63:44 - 63:49)
to it it was kind of a weird a weird (63:46 - 63:51)
journey for me so that night I just I (63:49 - 63:53)
had gotten like hardcore back into (63:51 - 63:56)
Pokemon and not with the expectation of (63:53 - 64:00)
making content out of it I got into (63:56 - 64:06)
content creating because I was a kind of (64:00 - 64:09)
a long story but I was a manager at (64:06 - 64:13)
American Eagle and I went in one day and (64:09 - 64:15)
I was just I was fed up working there I (64:13 - 64:18)
was fed up like working and not know (64:15 - 64:21)
working in general working there I was (64:18 - 64:23)
just fed up with it and I was tired of (64:21 - 64:26)
like people telling me what to do and (64:23 - 64:28)
things like that I'm not in a rebel (64:26 - 64:29)
sense but just you know in a working (64:28 - 64:33)
sense and so I went in one day and I had (64:29 - 64:34)
my keys and I just I threw him on the (64:33 - 64:36)
table and said I quit I'm gonna go be a (64:34 - 64:42)
youtuber and I tried that for a while (64:36 - 64:45)
and it didn't work okay and what you're (64:42 - 64:47)
telling me every youtubers dream of I (64:45 - 64:49)
want to be a youtuber sometimes doesn't (64:47 - 64:52)
work yeah it's crazy right crazy (64:49 - 64:56)
and so I I spent a year trying to create (64:52 - 64:58)
content and kind of figuring out my (64:56 - 65:02)
voice and it just didn't it didn't work (64:58 - 65:04)
and you know I'm sure as you have (65:02 - 65:07)
realized at times creating content like (65:04 - 65:10)
you know I I need some money I'd better (65:07 - 65:13)
go find a job yeah you know because I (65:10 - 65:15)
just gotten it was so it the thing (65:13 - 65:18)
as I had quit my job at American Eagle (65:15 - 65:22)
two months before getting married so (65:18 - 65:26)
that was a big big issue yeah if you (65:22 - 65:28)
need a way to throw out money very (65:26 - 65:31)
quickly right you get married and it'll (65:28 - 65:34)
suck all your money exactly exactly so (65:31 - 65:37)
that was a little worrisome but we still (65:34 - 65:40)
got married obviously but I went and got (65:37 - 65:43)
a job at a local doughnut shop in my (65:40 - 65:45)
town a small town of like no more than (65:43 - 65:47)
six thousand people a donut shop had (65:45 - 65:49)
went and I'd opened up and went and (65:47 - 65:53)
applied and started started essentially (65:49 - 65:55)
just making donuts and dipping Donuts (65:53 - 65:58)
into icing and they knew I had a passion (65:55 - 66:00)
for creating content so they let me be (65:58 - 66:04)
in charge of their of their social media (66:00 - 66:07)
and their marketing that kind of (66:04 - 66:09)
reignited my passion for content (66:07 - 66:13)
creating weirdly enough and so I started (66:09 - 66:15)
creating content again and I was (66:13 - 66:17)
creating a lot of content on Instagram (66:15 - 66:20)
more than I wasn't anything else and I (66:17 - 66:22)
started making Pokemon post on Instagram (66:20 - 66:24)
and people were like really enjoying (66:22 - 66:26)
them and I was like this is this is so (66:24 - 66:27)
crazy like I didn't know there was this (66:26 - 66:28)
huge (66:27 - 66:31)
online community of people that enjoyed (66:28 - 66:33)
Pokemon and just and sharing their (66:31 - 66:36)
passion with other people and then I (66:33 - 66:38)
kind of transitioned it over to youtube (66:36 - 66:41)
and I kind of found my voice weirdly (66:38 - 66:43)
enough I found my voice of just being (66:41 - 66:46)
myself I think when people start to (66:43 - 66:47)
create content they always think like (66:46 - 66:51)
they have to be some certain way and I (66:47 - 66:52)
just started being myself and just (66:51 - 66:55)
started being like my wacky trying to be (66:52 - 66:56)
funny at least I think I'm funny (66:55 - 66:59)
trying to just you just have a good time (66:56 - 67:02)
and laugh and smile and just make (66:59 - 67:04)
people's day brighter bring a smile to (67:02 - 67:07)
their face and and it worked I guess (67:04 - 67:10)
it's it's weird it's weird to think that (67:07 - 67:12)
just being yourself and sharing your (67:10 - 67:14)
passion can lead to something like this (67:12 - 67:17)
yeah how long ago was that the Instagram (67:14 - 67:21)
from Donuts to Instagram Donuts oh (67:17 - 67:24)
that's a book right there if I write a (67:21 - 67:27)
book that's the title (67:24 - 67:30)
so it would have been like late 2016 (67:27 - 67:33)
early 2017 okay in the period yeah that (67:30 - 67:34)
seems right that seems like where (67:33 - 67:37)
Instagram really kind of blew up 2016 (67:34 - 67:39)
ish it was one of those platforms like (67:37 - 67:41)
oh that's just where the kids are nobody (67:39 - 67:43)
else is on there and then look at it now (67:41 - 67:45)
it's huge yeah which by the way tick (67:43 - 67:47)
tock is gonna be the same way I'm saying (67:45 - 67:49)
it right now but and then I just (67:47 - 67:52)
transitioned everything over or I didn't (67:49 - 67:53)
transition it I just started doing stuff (67:52 - 67:57)
expanding it to YouTube and it just it (67:53 - 68:00)
started like blew up one day it (67:57 - 68:02)
literally like I don't I didn't have (68:00 - 68:04)
some sort of like secret game plan or (68:02 - 68:06)
something like that it just literally (68:04 - 68:13)
blew up and August of 2017 I quit my (68:06 - 68:15)
full-time job with the donut shop and (68:13 - 68:18)
was like hey if I'm going to if I'm (68:15 - 68:20)
serious about this I have to quit this (68:18 - 68:23)
job and I have to go into content (68:20 - 68:26)
creating I have to jump into the pool (68:23 - 68:27)
essentially like I can't dip my toes I (68:26 - 68:30)
have to jump in and it was a big leap of (68:27 - 68:32)
faith it's one of the scariest things I (68:30 - 68:34)
ever did my entire life was to quit a (68:32 - 68:38)
full-time job to believe in myself to do (68:34 - 68:41)
content grading and it's still working (68:38 - 68:43)
to this day so fingers crossed ago in (68:41 - 68:45)
that way well I don't think the Pokemon (68:43 - 68:48)
company is gonna stop making TCG cards (68:45 - 68:51)
anytime soon sign oh yeah I always tell (68:48 - 68:53)
people like I feel I feel like Pokemon (68:51 - 68:54)
is safe because a lot of times people (68:53 - 68:55)
always ask me like what are you gonna do (68:54 - 68:57)
when when Pokemon goes away I'm like I (68:55 - 69:00)
don't ever see that happening III think (68:57 - 69:03)
Pokemon is here to stay and I think a (69:00 - 69:07)
lot of my a lot of I don't like calling (69:03 - 69:08)
it a fan base because I can save (69:07 - 69:11)
everybody friends so I'll say fan base (69:08 - 69:13)
are friends but I think a lot of people (69:11 - 69:15)
come to the channel to just enjoy our (69:13 - 69:17)
time together they enjoy the Pokemon (69:15 - 69:19)
stuff there but they enjoy the time (69:17 - 69:21)
together because I I talk about my (69:19 - 69:23)
anxiety depression just going through (69:21 - 69:27)
life situations so I think people really (69:23 - 69:29)
really enjoy that so if Pokemon ever did (69:27 - 69:32)
go away I wouldn't be too concerned I (69:29 - 69:34)
mean I'd be concerned personally because (69:32 - 69:36)
I am absolutely a little too obsessed (69:34 - 69:38)
with Pokemon but (69:36 - 69:40)
as far as content creating I don't think (69:38 - 69:42)
I'd be crazy concerned yeah I was gonna (69:40 - 69:44)
say if not Pokemon like what else would (69:42 - 69:47)
you be doing but it sounds like you've (69:44 - 69:49)
probably pretty outright at doing social (69:47 - 69:52)
media for any kind of company I I feel (69:49 - 69:55)
like I would I think if to say if (69:52 - 69:58)
Pokemon ever stopped let's say it (69:55 - 69:59)
stopped tomorrow for some weird reason (69:58 - 70:02)
and I think obviously I would have a (69:59 - 70:03)
little bit of trouble with the (70:02 - 70:08)
transition but I love just positive (70:03 - 70:12)
thinking and and just kind of like (70:08 - 70:14)
motivational talk so I feel like I could (70:12 - 70:16)
do something (70:14 - 70:19)
motivation speaking on on YouTube (70:16 - 70:21)
alright alright or just or just sharing (70:19 - 70:23)
my life in general I don't know it's (70:21 - 70:25)
something along those lines but I feel (70:23 - 70:28)
like I feel like my fan base would enjoy (70:25 - 70:31)
that so we have a new game coming out (70:28 - 70:33)
we're sneaking this interview in like (70:31 - 70:37)
less than two weeks before pokemon sword (70:33 - 70:40)
and pokemon shield come out I'm sure (70:37 - 70:43)
you're very excited for that maybe maybe (70:40 - 70:44)
for the video games but obviously (70:43 - 70:47)
they're coming with the the TCG - yeah I (70:44 - 70:49)
mean obviously you come to my channel (70:47 - 70:54)
you see a lot of TCG stuff but I love (70:49 - 70:56)
anything that Pokemon releases so I get (70:54 - 70:57)
I get hyped about everything that they (70:56 - 71:01)
release I'm a total fanboy I can't help (70:57 - 71:04)
it that's who I am and I'm not (71:01 - 71:07)
everything that they release I enjoy but (71:04 - 71:08)
the initial phase of them releasing it I (71:07 - 71:11)
get excited so I am 100% hyped for a (71:08 - 71:14)
sword and shield was there a new Pokemon (71:11 - 71:15)
they've shown that caught your attention (71:14 - 71:19)
oh it's surfaced are you kidding me (71:15 - 71:21)
alright good you cannot like surface (71:19 - 71:25)
it's true it's I feel like it's long (71:21 - 71:28)
overdue for far-fetched to have some (71:25 - 71:32)
some evolution form it's it's it's one (71:28 - 71:35)
of those Pokemon that's like (71:32 - 71:36)
I don't know I think it's kind of (71:35 - 71:37)
secretly one of everybody's favorite (71:36 - 71:40)
Pokemon far-fetched but nobody wants to (71:37 - 71:41)
admit it (71:40 - 71:43)
I've said this before on the show or or (71:41 - 71:45)
what not but I feel like far-fetched has (71:43 - 71:48)
always been pretty popular but like I (71:45 - 71:49)
don't think anyone has like a secret (71:48 - 71:51)
popularity for like the love of qwilfish (71:49 - 71:55)
I don't think anyone's like like rolling (71:51 - 71:56)
up to a bar and pulling up their sleeve (71:55 - 71:58)
and showing off like a qwilfish tattoo I (71:56 - 72:01)
just don't think don't think that person (71:58 - 72:03)
exists up there but for far-fetched I (72:01 - 72:04)
think it does exist are you all a (72:03 - 72:08)
hundred percent I am sure I'm sure with (72:04 - 72:11)
a couple of quick google searches you (72:08 - 72:13)
can find some real hardcore far-fetched (72:11 - 72:17)
fans I'm sure so that's what I'm excited (72:13 - 72:19)
about right now is Sir fetched but I'm (72:17 - 72:22)
I'm just waiting for that gallery' (72:19 - 72:25)
inversion of Psyduck Hilarion Psyduck (72:22 - 72:30)
yes there's gotta be one right house (72:25 - 72:32)
there not one at this point yes that (72:30 - 72:35)
looks pretty popular alright and I feel (72:32 - 72:36)
like and that's also the downfall to I (72:35 - 72:38)
feel like it's so popular that they (72:36 - 72:40)
won't want to mess with it (72:38 - 72:42)
hmm just kind of like how we had the (72:40 - 72:44)
Aloha and Raichu but we didn't have a (72:42 - 72:45)
little and Pikachu right I can't read (72:44 - 72:48)
you don't mess with with like the main (72:45 - 72:50)
players you just put a pad on Pikachu (72:48 - 72:52)
and call it a day exactly and I feel (72:50 - 72:54)
like site that's the main player so they (72:52 - 72:55)
might not mess with it I can see you (72:54 - 72:57)
might be a Glary and Golduck but no site (72:55 - 73:02)
ugh okay okay I gotta ask although like (72:57 - 73:05)
I'm Shh I feel like I feel like TCG (73:02 - 73:07)
players have a different mindset with (73:05 - 73:09)
Pokemon altogether and not to harp on (73:07 - 73:11)
the TCG stuff but how do you feel about (73:09 - 73:14)
the national next thing that happened oh (73:11 - 73:22)
I don't care that's my that's my thing (73:14 - 73:24)
too and I think coming from a TCG (73:22 - 73:27)
standpoint and this is why I it doesn't (73:24 - 73:30)
bother me because whenever and whenever (73:27 - 73:33)
a new TCG set is released so we just (73:30 - 73:35)
have cosmic eclipsed by the time this (73:33 - 73:37)
podcast up is a cosmic eclipse will be (73:35 - 73:40)
released yeah it's the biggest set in (73:37 - 73:45)
Pokemon Pokemon history and whenever (73:40 - 73:47)
they release a new set not every Pokemon (73:45 - 73:48)
is in that set (73:47 - 73:51)
for me it makes sense to not have every (73:48 - 73:54)
Pokemon in the videogame as well it (73:51 - 73:57)
gives a uniqueness to the game almost by (73:54 - 73:59)
not putting every Pokemon in the game so (73:57 - 74:01)
then next time around when whatever is (73:59 - 74:03)
after sword and shield maybe we'll be (74:01 - 74:05)
excited about like oh what pokemon are (74:03 - 74:06)
they gonna put in there well they (74:05 - 74:10)
finally qwilfish is coming actually I (74:06 - 74:14)
think her fish isn't certain she but I (74:10 - 74:15)
mean that's kind of my standpoint I mean (74:14 - 74:18)
and that's and that's how the TCG has (74:15 - 74:19)
always been when we get the base set (74:18 - 74:22)
back in the 90s not every Pokemon from (74:19 - 74:25)
the 151 was in the base set it seems (74:22 - 74:28)
like a weird complaint but also at the (74:25 - 74:30)
same time I'm not one to judge someone (74:28 - 74:34)
of their preference I totally understand (74:30 - 74:36)
who someone is upset that not every (74:34 - 74:37)
Pokemon is in there but for me (74:36 - 74:40)
personally it doesn't bother me in the (74:37 - 74:44)
last 20-some years of Pokemon was there (74:40 - 74:48)
was there a game or even maybe a movie (74:44 - 74:49)
that was kind of like a huge (74:48 - 74:51)
disappointment for you something you you (74:49 - 74:53)
look forward to like let's say you were (74:51 - 74:56)
super excited for Magikarp jump it was (74:53 - 74:58)
gonna be your game of 2018 then it ended (74:56 - 75:01)
up being a flop no pun intended (74:58 - 75:02)
although I don't think anyone was ever (75:01 - 75:04)
upset with magikarps don't think he was (75:02 - 75:06)
pretty good I actually did a video on (75:04 - 75:10)
magic herb jump a long time ago that was (75:06 - 75:11)
2017 wasn't it (75:10 - 75:15)
17 yeah yeah yeah 17 yeah I think 2017 (75:11 - 75:17)
that my game play that was very (75:15 - 75:19)
short-lived I think I played that for (75:17 - 75:21)
like a week and then I was like okay I (75:19 - 75:23)
kind of get it like I felt like I was (75:21 - 75:25)
just kind of kept doing the same thing (75:23 - 75:27)
over and over again but it was a neat (75:25 - 75:30)
cute little game I mean that's and (75:27 - 75:33)
that's actually a hard question to look (75:30 - 75:36)
back on and think what what was a (75:33 - 75:39)
disappointment as you're thinking I (75:36 - 75:42)
could say that I was pretty disappointed (75:39 - 75:45)
with Crimson Invasion that entire (75:42 - 75:49)
release was oh the the that you're (75:45 - 75:51)
talking TCG or and anything I'm just I (75:49 - 75:54)
just know like well Pokemon duel was a (75:51 - 75:56)
huge bummer to me yes (75:54 - 75:58)
crimson invasion was a pretty big (75:56 - 76:01)
letdown crimson invasion is a little bit (75:58 - 76:02)
of a rough (76:01 - 76:04)
set the power of us I can't stand that (76:02 - 76:07)
movie is I was super hyped for it but (76:04 - 76:09)
man that movie didn't didn't do it for (76:07 - 76:12)
me I would okay here this is this might (76:09 - 76:15)
be a weird one but I think and this is (76:12 - 76:17)
over the span of year so this is not (76:15 - 76:19)
something specific I think I get a (76:17 - 76:22)
little disappointed with how little hype (76:19 - 76:24)
there is for when they do is theatrical (76:22 - 76:27)
releases okay yeah (76:24 - 76:29)
so I there because they make a lot of (76:27 - 76:33)
great movies even even the ones that are (76:29 - 76:35)
not so great are still great in a sense (76:33 - 76:37)
and I feel like they just don't hype (76:35 - 76:39)
them enough I know in Japan they do yeah (76:37 - 76:41)
like when it makes it to the rest of the (76:39 - 76:42)
world like there's just not enough hype (76:41 - 76:45)
for it so I think that would be one of (76:42 - 76:48)
my my biggest I don't want to say (76:45 - 76:50)
complaints or just let downs or (76:48 - 76:52)
disappointments it's I said I feel like (76:50 - 76:54)
every year when we get a movie I'm like (76:52 - 76:55)
okay this is the year where they're (76:54 - 76:57)
really gonna like hype it up and they'll (76:55 - 76:59)
give out a card when you go to see the (76:57 - 77:02)
movie or something like that and then (76:59 - 77:04)
they hardly ever do yeah Japan really (77:02 - 77:06)
treats movie releases like like a game (77:04 - 77:08)
release almost over there there's right (77:06 - 77:11)
yeah and now and now what there's a (77:08 - 77:14)
chance we're not getting the the Mewtwo (77:11 - 77:17)
movie for this year yeah I mean I think (77:14 - 77:19)
it's pretty clear that we're not getting (77:17 - 77:21)
me to at the Mewtwo movie at all this (77:19 - 77:24)
year maybe next year but maybe not at (77:21 - 77:27)
all do you think it maybe has something (77:24 - 77:30)
to do with detective Pikachu coming out (77:27 - 77:31)
this year (77:30 - 77:33)
they don't want two things in the (77:31 - 77:34)
theatre Pokemon this year (77:33 - 77:39)
I don't specifically know so I we (77:34 - 77:40)
actually talked about this a little bit (77:39 - 77:42)
last week and then somebody tweeted I (77:40 - 77:44)
apologize can't remember their name (77:42 - 77:45)
somebody tweeted where the source was (77:44 - 77:48)
and it was uh it was a comic book calm (77:45 - 77:51)
article but specifically it was it was (77:48 - 77:54)
somebody tweeting at Fath fathom events (77:51 - 77:56)
asking if the Mewtwo movie was coming (77:54 - 77:57)
out and they said that they didn't hear (77:56 - 77:59)
anything from the Pokemon company and (77:57 - 78:01)
they weren't handling any promotion or (77:59 - 78:02)
release for that movie as far as they (78:01 - 78:06)
knew so I guess you can elating you can (78:02 - 78:08)
only take so much from a tweet but fan (78:06 - 78:11)
fathom was the ones that did the power (78:08 - 78:16)
of us and I choose you and what (78:11 - 78:17)
the last I can't remember what movie was (78:16 - 78:19)
before I choose you that was like (78:17 - 78:20)
theater bound I know the black and white (78:19 - 78:23)
Victini movies were in theaters there's (78:20 - 78:26)
a very big time between that movie and I (78:23 - 78:29)
choose you I I think honestly I could (78:26 - 78:31)
probably see them just doing like a TV (78:29 - 78:34)
release of it yeah or they're on Disney (78:31 - 78:37)
XD now I think yeah yeah I could totally (78:34 - 78:39)
see them just doing just like throwing (78:37 - 78:41)
it up on Disney XD before I wonder if (78:39 - 78:43)
we'll get the anime this year in the (78:41 - 78:45)
United States for sword and shield or if (78:43 - 78:47)
they'll hold out because I don't think (78:45 - 78:49)
they're estimated to finish the u.s. (78:47 - 78:53)
anime until like April yeah so maybe I (78:49 - 78:54)
don't know maybe they use that as a (78:53 - 78:58)
premiere to the sword and shield anime (78:54 - 79:00)
I have no idea so like hey watch them (78:58 - 79:01)
YouTube movie right before the premiere (79:00 - 79:03)
in the episode premiere episode of (79:01 - 79:05)
Sauron shield I don't know it's (79:03 - 79:06)
interesting it's interesting how (79:05 - 79:09)
pokemons mind work yeah I feel like (79:06 - 79:11)
sometimes they they drop the ball with (79:09 - 79:14)
specific things like how I'll like for (79:11 - 79:16)
Pokemon day they they don't do like a (79:14 - 79:18)
distribution for us which I've (79:16 - 79:19)
complained about before like if you're (79:18 - 79:21)
going to celebrate in February is it (79:19 - 79:25)
February 27th I think yeah you have you (79:21 - 79:27)
have people with all these games and (79:25 - 79:29)
you're doing invents and Pokemon go but (79:27 - 79:31)
why are we not getting something for (79:29 - 79:33)
let's go like just give us a big leap up (79:31 - 79:34)
like it doesn't matter just give us (79:33 - 79:37)
something to commemorate that specific (79:34 - 79:42)
day I think Pokemon is huge in in the (79:37 - 79:44)
United States and Canada and in any part (79:42 - 79:47)
of the world honestly it's it's huge (79:44 - 79:52)
here so yeah I'm always puzzled that the (79:47 - 79:54)
that we don't go out a little bit more (79:52 - 79:57)
go all out so it's it's very interesting (79:54 - 80:00)
the the choices but I mean they know (79:57 - 80:02)
what they're doing the the brands been (80:00 - 80:05)
around this long yeah I'm not one to I'm (80:02 - 80:07)
not one to complain you did a YouTube (80:05 - 80:09)
video about this I think I saw this on (80:07 - 80:12)
your Instagram and I can I saw it I saw (80:09 - 80:13)
it when we first started talking but you (80:12 - 80:18)
have the legendary Pokemon snap thing (80:13 - 80:21)
from blockbuster Pokemon snap machine I (80:18 - 80:24)
don't know what the actual like the name (80:21 - 80:26)
of it is come on snap station snap (80:24 - 80:29)
station there you go yeah yeah I think (80:26 - 80:31)
there was one at every blockbuster (80:29 - 80:33)
mm-hmm I'm not sure how many (80:31 - 80:37)
blockbusters at one point exist I think (80:33 - 80:41)
they were also from what I've heard I (80:37 - 80:42)
haven't researched it too much I'm (80:41 - 80:45)
working on it like in-depth video of the (80:42 - 80:47)
snap station for the future and I (80:45 - 80:49)
haven't got to this point yet but I (80:47 - 80:52)
think in like Canada they were actually (80:49 - 80:55)
in McDonald's oh really I'm not 100% (80:52 - 80:57)
sure on that but some people have been (80:55 - 81:00)
saying that they they remember going to (80:57 - 81:04)
McDonald's and then seeing it okay so I (81:00 - 81:05)
thought it might have been a Canada (81:04 - 81:06)
thing but you have one in your house (81:05 - 81:08)
yeah it's actually sitting behind me (81:06 - 81:12)
right now I know I am assuming it works (81:08 - 81:15)
yeah 100% working condition I just I (81:12 - 81:18)
have a brand new studio that I'm (81:15 - 81:21)
currently working on and it's not been (81:18 - 81:23)
revealed at the time as we're recording (81:21 - 81:25)
this but once the podcast is out it'll (81:23 - 81:28)
be revealed so I have a snap station in (81:25 - 81:31)
my background and then on the other side (81:28 - 81:34)
which I have not shown at all and nobody (81:31 - 81:37)
knows that I have is a I don't know if (81:34 - 81:40)
you ever remember these but it's a (81:37 - 81:43)
Pokemon Pokemon catch arcade machine (81:40 - 81:47)
it's this huge arcade machine where (81:43 - 81:49)
these balls drop down and you have to (81:47 - 81:52)
throw my lisagreen hey no it's not it's (81:49 - 81:54)
like an arcade machine Oh weird (81:52 - 81:56)
like when I was in Japan there was a (81:54 - 81:58)
there was like an arcade machine where (81:56 - 82:00)
all these like little rubber balls would (81:58 - 82:02)
fall down and then you would throw them (82:00 - 82:04)
at a screen but I guess the screen had (82:02 - 82:06)
sensors in it so like a Pikachu would (82:04 - 82:08)
pop up you throw it and then you'd catch (82:06 - 82:10)
it and then if you got a high enough (82:08 - 82:11)
score it would actually print you out a (82:10 - 82:14)
card a collectible card with a QR code (82:11 - 82:19)
on that's that's way too advanced this (82:14 - 82:22)
right here this machine was from 2001 (82:19 - 82:27)
so back in back in that era and it has (82:22 - 82:30)
Veronica Taylor's voice on it voicing (82:27 - 82:34)
Ash and it's so it's just huge arcade (82:30 - 82:36)
machine so I have arcade machine on one (82:34 - 82:39)
side and the Pokemon snap station on the (82:36 - 82:40)
other side yes the Pokemon snap station (82:39 - 82:43)
is in 100% working condition is still (82:40 - 82:47)
prints out the stickers I think there's (82:43 - 82:49)
there's only like one thing missing to (82:47 - 82:51)
it and it's a little rubber keychain (82:49 - 82:54)
that went with the key that I don't have (82:51 - 82:56)
but other than that it works perfectly (82:54 - 83:00)
fine and prints out stickers and how did (82:56 - 83:03)
you acquire said snap station did you (83:00 - 83:05)
find like an abandoned Blockbuster that (83:03 - 83:06)
you like kicked down the door and (83:05 - 83:09)
dragged it out that's a YouTube video (83:06 - 83:13)
right there know it I had been its so I (83:09 - 83:16)
have like a like a most wanted list of (83:13 - 83:18)
Pokemon items that I just absolutely (83:16 - 83:22)
love and a lot of the items on the list (83:18 - 83:24)
are very just like obscure weird type of (83:22 - 83:25)
items (83:24 - 83:28)
i-i'll of I love a good bass set (83:25 - 83:32)
Charizard in my life but I really love (83:28 - 83:34)
these obscure items and so I've been (83:32 - 83:36)
searching for one for the longest time (83:34 - 83:39)
and let me tell you Facebook market (83:36 - 83:43)
place is a goldmine I have been I've (83:39 - 83:45)
been watching it I've been watching (83:43 - 83:47)
Facebook Marketplace hardcore and then (83:45 - 83:51)
literally on a Sunday at 4:00 p.m. one (83:47 - 83:54)
had popped up in Ohio I'm an Indiana and (83:51 - 83:56)
one popped up in Ohio it was like four (83:54 - 83:58)
hours away and I immediately messaged a (83:56 - 84:00)
guy I'm like all right I will pay you in (83:58 - 84:02)
cash I will come get it right now this (84:00 - 84:04)
moment it was a very spur-of-the-moment (84:02 - 84:07)
type of thing and he was down for it and (84:04 - 84:11)
I went there my wife went with me and (84:07 - 84:13)
she had to be at work in the morning at (84:11 - 84:17)
8 a.m. and she was she was a trooper she (84:13 - 84:19)
was the real trooper of that trip going (84:17 - 84:23)
on a last-minute trip essentially eight (84:19 - 84:25)
hours all together to get this pokemon (84:23 - 84:27)
snap station she had to be at work at (84:25 - 84:29)
8:00 a.m. we left it I think for Pete or (84:27 - 84:32)
4:30 p.m. so do you know where he got it (84:29 - 84:36)
was he like an X blockbuster employee he (84:32 - 84:39)
told me that he got it from one in (84:36 - 84:42)
Philadelphia who had bought it from a (84:39 - 84:45)
blockbuster store okay so um including (84:42 - 84:48)
Blockbuster I would be the fourth owner (84:45 - 84:51)
of it but it's in really really good (84:48 - 84:54)
condition I have extra ink I have extra (84:51 - 84:57)
paper extra cards that go with it as (84:54 - 84:58)
well (84:57 - 85:01)
but it was really it was crazy and so (84:58 - 85:02)
like I went over there (85:01 - 85:05)
and the guy was just a collector of (85:02 - 85:07)
video game stuff just even if he wasn't (85:05 - 85:10)
a fan of that brand video game he just (85:07 - 85:11)
collected video game stuff in general (85:10 - 85:15)
and he was like hey you want to come and (85:11 - 85:17)
see my video game stuff in my basement (85:15 - 85:21)
I'm like mmm sure stranger yeah why not (85:17 - 85:24)
so he went into his basement and he just (85:21 - 85:27)
had loads and loads of just video game (85:24 - 85:29)
stuff and there was just like random (85:27 - 85:30)
Pokemon stuff on the wall and then I (85:29 - 85:32)
just started throwing prices out at him (85:30 - 85:34)
I was like I gotta have it what do you (85:32 - 85:35)
want for this what do you want for this (85:34 - 85:38)
so I essentially went for the Pokemon (85:35 - 85:39)
snap station and then (85:38 - 85:41)
left with a bunch of other things Wow (85:39 - 85:43)
I'm sure he was probably very happy (85:41 - 85:47)
right he wasn't a huge pokemon fan so it (85:43 - 85:50)
was okay he didn't really mind letting (85:47 - 85:53)
them go but like I left with a box of (85:50 - 85:57)
unopened Pokemon pop-tarts and a box of (85:53 - 86:00)
unopened Pokemon fruit roll-ups I don't (85:57 - 86:02)
know if you remember those two I do yeah (86:00 - 86:04)
and those things are like I'm my most (86:02 - 86:06)
wanted list I'm sorry sure there was (86:04 - 86:08)
like Pokemon SpaghettiOs at one point (86:06 - 86:10)
there was that's really hard to find (86:08 - 86:12)
oh right that's on my list that's the (86:10 - 86:14)
gem right there it is it's one of the (86:12 - 86:18)
gyms I'm really into collecting like the (86:14 - 86:21)
old Pokemon food food merchandise so (86:18 - 86:25)
like remember a goes yes yes so like (86:21 - 86:26)
they had Pokemon Eggos and that's (86:25 - 86:28)
extremely hard to find (86:26 - 86:30)
okay all right so so you're saying (86:28 - 86:33)
SpaghettiOs above like the pop-tarts (86:30 - 86:36)
above the cereal above the the fruit (86:33 - 86:37)
roll-ups (86:36 - 86:40)
yes spaghetti SpaghettiOs definitely (86:37 - 86:44)
above all of that but Eggos and (86:40 - 86:47)
popsicles I think are the top one oh (86:44 - 86:50)
well as popsicles be you you have your (86:47 - 86:53)
freezer go bad all of us and you well (86:50 - 86:55)
maybe not necessarily having the (86:53 - 86:56)
popsicles with it but the box (86:55 - 86:59)
okay the Box just yeah the frozen items (86:56 - 87:00)
you can't really can't really keep (86:59 - 87:02)
around but the box essentially okay is (87:00 - 87:05)
what I'm asking so come on out there (87:02 - 87:09)
house box of Pikachu popsicles do you (87:05 - 87:10)
remember those I don't remember I (87:09 - 87:12)
remember the a goes I'm pretty sure I (87:10 - 87:16)
ate the egg goes if it was any kind of (87:12 - 87:18)
processed food with Pokemon on it my (87:16 - 87:20)
parents and my parents had a coupon we (87:18 - 87:25)
would have gotten it the ninety was very (87:20 - 87:29)
wild when I came to food what are you (87:25 - 87:31)
looking forward to for 20 Tony (87:29 - 87:33)
whether that's career-wise or Pokemon (87:31 - 87:36)
wise or anything could be could be just (87:33 - 87:39)
anything in general I am looking forward (87:36 - 87:45)
to hopefully not being so anxious about (87:39 - 87:48)
everything I know that sounds weird but (87:45 - 87:51)
I have I have extreme anxiety about (87:48 - 87:53)
everything that I do and (87:51 - 87:56)
life in general and so my personal goal (87:53 - 88:00)
is to not be so anxious about everything (87:56 - 88:05)
but if we're talking on maybe the sense (88:00 - 88:08)
of Pokemon I just I I just hope that (88:05 - 88:11)
they start expanding more I know that (88:08 - 88:13)
sounds weird because they're all over (88:11 - 88:15)
the world but I feel like there's so (88:13 - 88:17)
much more that they can expand upon and (88:15 - 88:20)
I feel like 2020 is the year for that (88:17 - 88:24)
okay all right because there's a the (88:20 - 88:27)
rumor right now is that with the Pokemon (88:24 - 88:31)
TCG Japan's always been like a set ahead (88:27 - 88:33)
of us so they have the cards before we (88:31 - 88:35)
do but the rumor now is that that we're (88:33 - 88:37)
gonna be we're gonna be synced together (88:35 - 88:39)
and that they're gonna be releasing (88:37 - 88:42)
together at the same time yeah Japan is (88:39 - 88:44)
at an advantage I guess for having cards (88:42 - 88:46)
earlier but also at a disadvantage (88:44 - 88:47)
because they have to always play (88:46 - 88:49)
backwards when it comes to like world (88:47 - 88:51)
tournaments yeah exactly and I think (88:49 - 88:54)
Pokemon is looking to fix that by having (88:51 - 88:56)
the same release dates of everything cuz (88:54 - 88:59)
now as of once cosmic eclipse comes out (88:56 - 89:03)
we will 100% be caught up to what's (88:59 - 89:05)
released in Japan see my my dream is for (89:03 - 89:08)
them to finally redo the backs of the (89:05 - 89:12)
cards because they're awful I know that (89:08 - 89:15)
I know that would drive a million people (89:12 - 89:16)
crazy and it would ruin expand it and (89:15 - 89:19)
that would ruin a legacy and all this (89:16 - 89:22)
stuff but just start fresh (89:19 - 89:24)
get new backs of cards for everyone (89:22 - 89:25)
because Japan still has different backs (89:24 - 89:28)
than everyone else right yeah and Japan (89:25 - 89:29)
at one point did change their backs (89:28 - 89:33)
yeah Alton they did so unify the format (89:29 - 89:36)
get new backs of cards for everyone and (89:33 - 89:39)
then update that gosh awful Pokemon (89:36 - 89:41)
Trading Card Game online app because (89:39 - 89:45)
it's still stuck in like 2008 with that (89:41 - 89:48)
wooden background that I I hate but (89:45 - 89:49)
there was also rumors that a different (89:48 - 89:52)
company is working on a new TCG app for (89:49 - 89:55)
Pokemon that'll be good there was a (89:52 - 89:57)
rumor that the people who made the Magic (89:55 - 90:00)
the Gathering online TCG app is (89:57 - 90:02)
currently working on the Pokemon one but (90:00 - 90:05)
I I can't narrow down like a reliable (90:02 - 90:07)
source on that just (90:05 - 90:10)
I mean so if they change the backs of (90:07 - 90:11)
the cards would you want them to change (90:10 - 90:13)
change it to what it looks like in Japan (90:11 - 90:17)
or just completely change both Japan and (90:13 - 90:19)
the rest of the world's cards back I (90:17 - 90:22)
actually like Japan's card backs I think (90:19 - 90:23)
they're pretty clean although they are (90:22 - 90:25)
missing here every one right in front of (90:23 - 90:28)
me well first off the the button is on (90:25 - 90:31)
the right part of the pokeball yeah the (90:28 - 90:32)
buttons on the red part that's a white (90:31 - 90:36)
heart but Japan has uh it's missing (90:32 - 90:40)
ferry and steel and dark on the back I (90:36 - 90:41)
guess technically okay (90:40 - 90:43)
yeah but otherwise it has the other (90:41 - 90:46)
symbols but I don't know I don't mind (90:43 - 90:48)
the Japan back as it is now the original (90:46 - 90:51)
Japan pact was kind of pretty awful I (90:48 - 90:53)
remember that I was always thought that (90:51 - 90:56)
was a weird one for some reason I don't (90:53 - 90:58)
know I kind of like I kind of like the (90:56 - 91:01)
Halden on Japan card backs look there's (90:58 - 91:03)
just something nostalgic about it (91:01 - 91:05)
because like you can look at the back of (91:03 - 91:07)
the car and it's the same in the 90s is (91:05 - 91:08)
it hell yeah (91:07 - 91:11)
maybe I just want to forget everything (91:08 - 91:14)
like you know if people are coming back (91:11 - 91:15)
into you know maybe they're getting back (91:14 - 91:17)
into Pokemon they look at that card back (91:15 - 91:19)
and they're just like ah I'm home I'm (91:17 - 91:21)
finally back home yeah that's true (91:19 - 91:23)
there's that like rush of nostalgia and (91:21 - 91:26)
stuff when they hit that also just big (91:23 - 91:29)
so is in Japan also doesn't have certain (91:26 - 91:31)
cards as us like they don't have reverse (91:29 - 91:34)
Hallows there yeah yeah so we we have (91:31 - 91:37)
and we have some things that that they (91:34 - 91:38)
don't have but it would be nice to just (91:37 - 91:41)
all be on sync like the entire world be (91:38 - 91:44)
one be on sync together with the Pokemon (91:41 - 91:46)
TCG well speaking of being on sync I (91:44 - 91:49)
should probably let you go but where can (91:46 - 91:53)
our listeners find you that was thinking (91:49 - 91:54)
part that was the transits that (91:53 - 91:56)

wow it's a legume it's a legume (98:10 - 98:15)
peanuts aren't a vegetable they're a (98:13 - 98:19)
legume that is also true Katherine will (98:15 - 98:20)
do two questions here Katherine if you (98:19 - 98:22)
did not make Pokemon content would you (98:20 - 98:25)
still seek out leeks or not I didn't (98:22 - 98:27)
make Pokemon content for a long time and (98:25 - 98:29)
I did seek out leeks so the answer for (98:27 - 98:32)
me is yes but I seek I'm one of those (98:29 - 98:35)
like I seek them out very early on and (98:32 - 98:39)
then like that comes a point because I (98:35 - 98:42)
have a weird imaginary timeline and when (98:39 - 98:44)
we have crossed that line to X amount of (98:42 - 98:46)
weeks away from the game then I stop (98:44 - 98:49)
looking but I don't I don't seek out (98:46 - 98:52)
leeks where that there's a resumption in (98:49 - 98:54)
this question that I like I avoid leaks (98:52 - 98:56)
as much as possible I avoid spoilers as (98:54 - 98:58)
much as possible Steve do you see get (98:56 - 99:00)
leeks would you if you didn't make this (98:58 - 99:02)
podcast yeah yeah yeah I think so I've (99:00 - 99:04)
given the situation before where I did (99:02 - 99:07)
not care about any of the Marvel movies (99:04 - 99:08)
what was that Marvel movie that was like (99:07 - 99:13)
18 hours long end game yeah and so when (99:08 - 99:14)
everyone was talking about it I've like (99:13 - 99:18)
read the Wikipedia synopsis and then (99:14 - 99:20)
after reading it I was like oh maybe I (99:18 - 99:21)
want to see this movie now now that I (99:20 - 99:24)
know the ending that brings up my (99:21 - 99:26)
complaint about you two saying you need (99:24 - 99:29)
a superhero expert on the show I have (99:26 - 99:31)
not read comics since the age of 14 and (99:29 - 99:34)
followed every movie to be disrespected (99:31 - 99:37)
like that are you still reading comics (99:34 - 99:40)
no could I get too expensive so I got to (99:37 - 99:41)
taxi (99:40 - 99:44)
Oh comics fandom (99:41 - 99:47)
yike yeah I would I would still sneak (99:44 - 99:51)
out weeks I like Pokemon too much too so (99:47 - 99:55)
it's a wait I guess in patience for the (99:51 - 99:59)
win will give us our Pokemon of the week (99:55 - 100:03)
all right so last week's Pokemon once (99:59 - 100:05)
again I was taking my Saturday morning (100:03 - 100:08)
walk and I was going through I had to (100:05 - 100:11)
clean out my Pokemon go Pokemon but I (100:08 - 100:14)
didn't want to do any Kanto ones because (100:11 - 100:16)
I had to transfer them until let's go so (100:14 - 100:18)
I could do all that biz that you have to (100:16 - 100:22)
do so I was going through Jojo and (100:18 - 100:24)
as I was going through Johto I (100:22 - 100:28)
discovered that after Pokemon number 224 (100:24 - 100:30)
there are two Pokemon that you would (100:28 - 100:33)
expect to be next to each other because (100:30 - 100:36)
of a particular holiday that they deal (100:33 - 100:38)
with but they are not next to each other (100:36 - 100:42)
and the second one of those is the first (100:38 - 100:45)
normal type pokémon in pokedex order (100:42 - 100:47)
that can learn the move calm mind (100:45 - 100:53)
who was that Pokemon it's Stantler (100:47 - 100:56)
gorebyss Stantler dude it's de corpus is (100:53 - 100:57)
not even normal type (100:56 - 101:00)
[Laughter] (100:57 - 101:03)
what is wrong with you let me call it (101:00 - 101:07)
the speak with your mother spoke to my (101:03 - 101:11)
mother before well now I have particular (101:07 - 101:15)
issues I need to bring up with her what (101:11 - 101:16)
do you what do you want to know is about (101:15 - 101:20)
Stantler it has a thick but he's got (101:16 - 101:22)
that booty Stantler maybe a combination (101:20 - 101:27)
of stag or stair and antlers probably (101:22 - 101:29)
staying an antler all right well but he (101:27 - 101:32)
said eyes in its horn yeah it's got a (101:29 - 101:35)
real bad green shiny I do not like the (101:32 - 101:39)
stainless shiny what about its shuffle (101:35 - 101:43)
shuffle icon on point so good yeah (101:39 - 101:44)
that's pretty good (101:43 - 101:47)
it's so crabby so it's like it's like (101:44 - 101:50)
over everything about you and it's extra (101:47 - 101:52)
set of eyes and thus antlers are like (101:50 - 101:54)
also over you so Sandler is found on (101:52 - 101:57)
route 36 which leads to violet City the (101:54 - 102:01)
in-game counterpart of Nara Japan a city (101:57 - 102:04)
where tame deer roam freely did you (102:01 - 102:05)
visit Nara when you were in Japan (102:04 - 102:09)
I didn't missed opportunity that's go (102:05 - 102:10)
meet some sailor (102:09 - 102:12)
if Irene and I can figure out a way to (102:10 - 102:15)
go to Japan next year I think it's it's (102:12 - 102:17)
on the list but I think it's south of (102:15 - 102:18)
Tokyo (102:17 - 102:23)
I think it's southwest but I do not have (102:18 - 102:25)
a tie game I got a nice jacket I got a (102:23 - 102:28)
map it's it's it's like below Osaka so (102:25 - 102:31)
okay if we were to go back to Tokyo it (102:28 - 102:34)
would probably be like not as many days (102:31 - 102:36)
in Tokyo and more days in like Kyoto and (102:34 - 102:39)
Osaka yeah I want to go to Kyoto places (102:36 - 102:41)
not all of them I want to go to Japan (102:39 - 102:43)
I'm in there me either (102:41 - 102:46)
and I have friends there oh boy I am in (102:43 - 102:47)
you too Oh Stanley (102:46 - 102:49)
yeah sorry Stantler so boring that we (102:47 - 102:55)
start talking about Japan the shade the (102:49 - 102:57)
German name for Sandler is real good but (102:55 - 102:59)
it don't speak German give us our (102:57 - 103:02)
Pokemon for next week all right (102:59 - 103:04)
ever since the black and white - Pokemon (103:02 - 103:07)
games I have maintained a living pokedex (103:04 - 103:09)
for those who are unfamiliar with the (103:07 - 103:11)
concept a living dex means that you (103:09 - 103:13)
owned one of every (103:11 - 103:15)
c'mom including an individual of each (103:13 - 103:19)
stage of evolution when let's go Pikachu (103:15 - 103:22)
and Eevee came out I no longer had a (103:19 - 103:26)
living Dex what I was having difficulty (103:22 - 103:28)
restoring my living Dex because the key (103:26 - 103:31)
