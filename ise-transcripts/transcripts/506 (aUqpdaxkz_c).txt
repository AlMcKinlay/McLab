nightmare universe i'm over it i'm just (0:43 - 0:48)
going to go back to bed (0:45 - 0:49)
got it (0:48 - 0:53)
well also here my husband packed (0:49 - 0:56)
a can of dinty moore and every heavy (0:53 - 0:59)
root vegetable in one bag and then was (0:56 - 1:01)
surprised when it ripped (0:59 - 1:03)
getting it out of the cart and i looked (1:01 - 1:05)
at him and i said (1:03 - 1:06)
why (1:05 - 1:10)
what did you do he's like well (1:06 - 1:11)
maybe i put all the heavy root (1:10 - 1:14)
vegetables into one bag and the cans (1:11 - 1:18)
what am i supposed to do with that (1:14 - 1:18)
um i mean the real problem is the fact (1:18 - 1:22)
that you're buying fruit vegetables and (1:20 - 1:24)
dinty more don't (1:22 - 1:26)
just don't there's a double bag got a (1:24 - 1:27)

the earth yeah why are you using bags at (1:29 - 1:32)
all (1:31 - 1:34)
if you properly bag you don't need a (1:32 - 1:35)
double bag (1:34 - 1:38)
instead i have this torn up bag in the (1:35 - 1:40)
back of my car leaking cabbage (1:38 - 1:41)
everywhere (1:40 - 1:43)
cabbage is not a root vegetable (1:41 - 1:48)

alternative universe of the world being (11:06 - 11:10)
destroyed not necessarily he eats (11:08 - 11:12)

is this true (11:20 - 11:23)
um okay (11:21 - 11:27)
april community day stufful (11:23 - 11:29)
there's a lot to unpack here (11:27 - 11:31)
i have a lot of thoughts (11:29 - 11:33)
and there are a lot i think the thing (11:31 - 11:34)
about this (11:33 - 11:37)
this drama drama (11:34 - 11:40)
is that there's multiple issues and (11:37 - 11:42)
they're all they're being like put into (11:40 - 11:44)
one where they kind of need like there (11:42 - 11:48)
are multiple issues to this (11:44 - 11:48)
and some are more important than others (11:49 - 11:53)
but they're all getting thrown into this (11:51 - 11:55)
like huge glob (11:53 - 11:56)
so we're going to try to break these (11:55 - 11:58)
apart here (11:56 - 12:00)
um (11:58 - 12:03)
i feel like (12:00 - 12:03)
let's go through it there's a lot there (12:03 - 12:07)
are there are good things here (12:05 - 12:11)
so believe it or not (12:07 - 12:13)
i haven't even started to care yet so (12:11 - 12:15)
i'm wondering what the whole mystery of (12:13 - 12:17)
the drama is (12:15 - 12:19)
there are absolutely good things here a (12:17 - 12:21)
million percent (12:19 - 12:22)
okay (12:21 - 12:24)
so april community day saturday april (12:22 - 12:28)
23rd from two to five local time (12:24 - 12:29)
trainers (12:28 - 12:31)
we are excited to announce stufful the (12:29 - 12:34)
flailing pokemon will make its pokemon (12:31 - 12:37)
go debut during april community event (12:34 - 12:39)
stuff will appear in the wild if you're (12:37 - 12:41)
lucky you may appear you may encounter a (12:39 - 12:43)
shiny one (12:41 - 12:46)
community day adjustments we also wanted (12:43 - 12:48)
to take a moment to discuss some of the (12:46 - 12:50)
changes for the community day format (12:48 - 12:51)
we'll be testing (12:50 - 12:54)
in 2020 we doubled the length of (12:51 - 12:55)
community days extending them from three (12:54 - 12:57)
hours to six hours (12:55 - 12:59)
since then however we found that only (12:57 - 13:01)
five percent of our trainers tend to (12:59 - 13:03)
participate in the event for more than (13:01 - 13:05)
three hours (13:03 - 13:07)
one of the biggest pieces of positive (13:05 - 13:09)
feedback we've received after january's (13:07 - 13:11)
three-hour classic community day was (13:09 - 13:13)
that players and community leaders (13:11 - 13:15)
noticed how much more of community was (13:13 - 13:18)
out and about during those events so (13:15 - 13:19)
stuffel's community will be returning to (13:18 - 13:22)
a three-hour format (13:19 - 13:24)
our hope is that doing so will create (13:22 - 13:26)
even more opportunities for trainers to (13:24 - 13:27)
play together and connect outside while (13:26 - 13:29)
they're exploring (13:27 - 13:30)
we know that trainers have enjoyed the (13:29 - 13:32)
extra resources that they can collect (13:30 - 13:34)
during longer events so we're adding (13:32 - 13:36)
some new and exciting perks to stufful (13:34 - 13:38)
community day to give you the ability to (13:36 - 13:40)
collect as many resources during the (13:38 - 13:42)
game during gameplay check them out (13:40 - 13:43)
below (13:42 - 13:45)
also i will (13:43 - 13:47)
if maybe you're a new listener to the (13:45 - 13:48)
show (13:47 - 13:50)
and maybe you remember the um what was (13:48 - 13:52)
it the uh (13:50 - 13:54)
distance (13:52 - 13:56)
changes where like you could reach a (13:54 - 13:57)
pokestop farther (13:56 - 13:58)
um (13:57 - 14:00)
i was apart (13:58 - 14:01)
and i guess you could say i'm still a (14:00 - 14:05)
part of the niantic task force (14:01 - 14:07)
i was a part of those conversations i (14:05 - 14:10)
was there when they explained how (14:07 - 14:12)
um they were like well we want you to (14:10 - 14:14)
see the statue you spin and here's a map (14:12 - 14:16)
that shows like there's a building in (14:14 - 14:18)
front of you (14:16 - 14:20)
you would make me angry again just don't (14:18 - 14:22)
keep explaining because i'm already mad (14:20 - 14:25)
at them again (14:22 - 14:25)
um (14:25 - 14:29)
so i'm not really sure how much i'm (14:27 - 14:31)
allowed to say or not to say from the (14:29 - 14:33)
conversations leading up to (14:31 - 14:36)
this change (14:33 - 14:38)
but i will say that me and other (14:36 - 14:41)
creators were like (14:38 - 14:42)
people aren't going to be happy if you (14:41 - 14:44)
do this (14:42 - 14:45)
and they were like well we have a bunch (14:44 - 14:47)
of reasons (14:45 - 14:49)
we're going to try it and we'll just (14:47 - 14:52)
we'll see what happens after that (14:49 - 14:54)
and we'll go through these reasons here (14:52 - 14:55)
in a second (14:54 - 14:57)
so stuffel will be appearing more in the (14:55 - 15:00)
wild beware will have an exclusive (14:57 - 15:02)
uh attack just like all community (15:00 - 15:05)
pokemon it will have a charge attack (15:02 - 15:06)
drain punch which is a fighting type (15:05 - 15:07)
move (15:06 - 15:09)
i believe this is really good for go (15:07 - 15:11)
battle league for those that care about (15:09 - 15:13)
go back i think i think the gbl people (15:11 - 15:16)
were like yes this move is very good uh (15:13 - 15:18)
beware should be pretty okay for go (15:16 - 15:19)
battle league (15:18 - 15:22)
um you will need 400 stufful candy to (15:19 - 15:24)
evolve stuffel so stuffel will be the (15:22 - 15:25)
same for um (15:24 - 15:27)
suabloo (15:25 - 15:29)
and magikarp i think are the two i don't (15:27 - 15:31)
know if there's a third one (15:29 - 15:32)
um (15:31 - 15:34)
fibas (15:32 - 15:36)
no you just have to (15:34 - 15:39)
walk with or whatever (15:36 - 15:41)
also like what happened to larvesta (15:39 - 15:42)
because we all thought our vessel was (15:41 - 15:45)
going to be a 400 candy pokemon and like (15:42 - 15:46)
larves is still not here yeah or (15:45 - 15:48)
whatever (15:46 - 15:50)
uh community day (15:48 - 15:52)
research story strong stuff for one (15:50 - 15:54)
dollar you'll be able to access the (15:52 - 15:56)
stuffel community strong stuff storyline (15:54 - 15:59)
stay tuned for the tickets tickets are (15:56 - 16:01)
non-refundable (15:59 - 16:03)
okay event bonuses (16:01 - 16:05)
you're gonna get three times the catch (16:03 - 16:06)
xp (16:05 - 16:08)
you're gonna get two times the catch (16:06 - 16:11)
candy you can get two times the chance (16:08 - 16:12)
to receive stuffel xl candy from (16:11 - 16:15)
catching stuffel your incense will last (16:12 - 16:16)
three hours (16:15 - 16:20)
your lure modules will last three hours (16:16 - 16:22)
you can take surprise snapshots for (16:20 - 16:24)
the (16:22 - 16:26)
smeargle thing but it's not smeargle you (16:24 - 16:29)
can do one extra special trade the event (16:26 - 16:31)
and two hours uh made during the event (16:29 - 16:33)
and two hours after the event so two (16:31 - 16:35)
special trades for (16:33 - 16:38)
the time and then your trades for the (16:35 - 16:39)
event and then two hours after the event (16:38 - 16:42)
will be 50 less stardust and that seems (16:39 - 16:45)
like all trades so yes you can trade two (16:42 - 16:47)
specials but all your trades will be (16:45 - 16:51)
50 off during a five hour window (16:47 - 16:54)
uh there will also be a group play bonus (16:51 - 16:57)
so this is (16:54 - 16:59)
we'll go we can go back to the event (16:57 - 17:00)
stuff but there's way more event bonuses (16:59 - 17:02)
than there ever has been for community (17:00 - 17:05)
so technically a positive uh group play (17:02 - 17:06)
bonus work together with other trainers (17:05 - 17:09)
to unlock bonuses in that location (17:06 - 17:11)
if enough pokemon are caught by a (17:09 - 17:13)
trainer from a single lure (17:11 - 17:16)
uh the three times bonus for catching (17:13 - 17:17)
pokemon near the alert pokestop will (17:16 - 17:21)
increase to four times for 30 minutes (17:17 - 17:23)
and then it says this bonus will not (17:21 - 17:25)
stack with the base three times it will (17:23 - 17:29)
instead replace it (17:25 - 17:29)
and then there will be that scam box (17:31 - 17:35)
that they always do which i've said (17:33 - 17:36)
every single day (17:35 - 17:38)
and ever since they introduced it it's a (17:36 - 17:40)
scam but there will be a one-time (17:38 - 17:42)
special community box for 850 pokemon (17:40 - 17:44)
poke coins actually it's cheaper it's (17:42 - 17:47)
normally 12.50 i think (17:44 - 17:50)
they're saying 850 here 15 ultra balls (17:47 - 17:54)
15 pin apps one elite fast tm and one (17:50 - 17:56)
remote raid pass there will also be a (17:54 - 17:59)
free 30 ultra ball bundle in the shop at (17:56 - 18:02)
no cost there will also be some stickers (17:59 - 18:04)
regarding stuffel and then that's that's (18:02 - 18:08)
it so that's the whole community post (18:04 - 18:09)
um (18:08 - 18:11)
so (18:09 - 18:13)
the good things here (18:11 - 18:16)
i think this lure (18:13 - 18:19)
bonus thingy that they're doing (18:16 - 18:21)
is cool i think it's really great i (18:19 - 18:25)
think it's uh we i i've i've i've (18:21 - 18:28)
become a rilla boom and beat my drum for (18:25 - 18:31)
well over two years on community days (18:28 - 18:34)
are boring now and they need to change (18:31 - 18:34)
and (18:34 - 18:37)
one of my suggestions was why do we not (18:34 - 18:39)
get more special traits (18:37 - 18:42)
and they're giving us once more special (18:39 - 18:43)
trade (18:42 - 18:44)
three would be nice i feel like three is (18:43 - 18:46)
a good number people have to be sure (18:44 - 18:47)
they use them because we know they're (18:46 - 18:49)
watching now so if you use two then (18:47 - 18:51)
they're going to give you three (18:49 - 18:52)
yeah maybe (18:51 - 18:53)
um (18:52 - 18:55)
so i think the lure thing is really (18:53 - 18:56)
interesting i would never thought of (18:55 - 18:58)
that i think that is that is really (18:56 - 18:59)
great (18:58 - 19:00)
for (18:59 - 19:02)
people who do play at parks or downtown (19:00 - 19:03)
areas or malls or wherever they're (19:02 - 19:05)
playing to like (19:03 - 19:06)
increase the amount of xp right that's (19:05 - 19:08)
one of the reasons people go out is like (19:06 - 19:11)
hey it's triple xp or it's double catch (19:08 - 19:13)
candy or (19:11 - 19:14)
i don't (19:13 - 19:16)
i can hatch my eggs faster i guess um so (19:14 - 19:19)
i do like that um and then usually a (19:16 - 19:21)
community day is one bonus right it's (19:19 - 19:23)
usually your eggs hatch faster or you're (19:21 - 19:24)
getting double catch candy in this (19:23 - 19:26)
instance we're getting two we're getting (19:24 - 19:28)
three times the catch xp (19:26 - 19:29)
and we're getting two times the catch (19:28 - 19:32)
candy so that's a that's a win um and (19:29 - 19:33)
they're also saying we're getting more (19:32 - 19:37)
xl candy as well so that's great (19:33 - 19:38)
um and then we already talked about the (19:37 - 19:41)
the special traits so (19:38 - 19:42)
that's the good stuff (19:41 - 19:43)
they're trying a new lure thing they're (19:42 - 19:46)
giving us even more bonuses (19:43 - 19:49)
and then the bad stuff (19:46 - 19:50)
um (19:49 - 19:51)
is the (19:50 - 19:53)
shorter duration (19:51 - 19:55)
so we're going back from six to three (19:53 - 19:58)
and then (19:55 - 19:58)
people are like oh stufful's 400. (19:58 - 20:02)
i (20:01 - 20:04)
not i personally like what what else are (20:02 - 20:05)
you doing can we create you're catching (20:04 - 20:07)
stuff alike i don't think that's that (20:05 - 20:08)
big of a deal (20:07 - 20:10)
um (20:08 - 20:11)
you (20:10 - 20:14)
if you did not know you can mega evolve (20:11 - 20:15)
either (20:14 - 20:16)
pidgeot (20:15 - 20:18)
or (20:16 - 20:19)
la bunny (20:18 - 20:21)
and you'll get bonus (20:19 - 20:25)
candy because those are normal types (20:21 - 20:27)
i don't know if stuffel is i know beware (20:25 - 20:30)
is fighting normal i don't remember if i (20:27 - 20:32)
think stuffel is just plain normal yeah (20:30 - 20:35)
that's why pidgeot and la honey work (20:32 - 20:37)
so (20:35 - 20:39)
without a pin app (20:37 - 20:40)
you're already getting six candy for (20:39 - 20:43)
catching stuffel with a pin app you're (20:40 - 20:46)
getting 12 with a pin app (20:43 - 20:49)
and a lot honey or or pidgeot active (20:46 - 20:51)
you'll be getting 13. so 400 divided (20:49 - 20:53)
scuffle is normal in fighting i'm just (20:51 - 20:54)
going to say our fact checkers just (20:53 - 20:57)
called in yes yeah so (20:54 - 20:58)
so (20:57 - 21:00)
with a with a pin app and double catch (20:58 - 21:03)
candy you are getting 12 400 divided by (21:00 - 21:07)
12 is 33 that means you need to catch 33 (21:03 - 21:09)
stuffles in order to evolve one into a (21:07 - 21:10)
beware (21:09 - 21:12)
that means you have to catch 10 stuffels (21:10 - 21:15)
an hour (21:12 - 21:15)
if you're playing all three hours and (21:16 - 21:20)
your complaint is it's 400 candy i don't (21:18 - 21:22)
what are you doing to like to like 10 (21:20 - 21:23)
poke (21:22 - 21:26)
like 10 snuffles is an hour is pretty (21:23 - 21:28)
easy i guess that gets you one beware (21:26 - 21:29)
um (21:28 - 21:32)
if it's 400 divided by 13 meaning you (21:29 - 21:34)
have the the (21:32 - 21:36)
the la penny active you have to catch (21:34 - 21:37)
30. so (21:36 - 21:40)
one less an hour (21:37 - 21:40)
uh (21:40 - 21:43)
i don't think the candy's that big of a (21:42 - 21:45)
deal because also that's not taking in (21:43 - 21:47)
account that like you're probably gonna (21:45 - 21:48)
catch (21:47 - 21:49)
a hundred scuffle and then you're (21:48 - 21:51)
probably gonna throw away 99 of them (21:49 - 21:53)
you're gonna get candy from that as well (21:51 - 21:56)
uh it i guess maybe if we were like i (21:53 - 21:57)
don't want to catch because catching (21:56 - 21:58)
takes time and then that's but then i (21:57 - 22:00)
can't shiny check i don't know do you (21:58 - 22:02)
not have a pokeball look are you (22:00 - 22:03)
listening to this podcast playing (22:02 - 22:04)
pokemon community not having a pokeball (22:03 - 22:06)
plus at this point do i get one of those (22:04 - 22:09)
gotcha machines from target i don't know (22:06 - 22:11)
there's there's options there but i (22:09 - 22:12)
think that i think that's my first (22:11 - 22:14)
complaint that people were complaining (22:12 - 22:17)
that's 400 candy (22:14 - 22:19)
it's it's double catch candy pinapps (22:17 - 22:20)
exist (22:19 - 22:21)
like what else are you doing in korean (22:20 - 22:22)
day i don't think that that if that's (22:21 - 22:24)
your complaint that's a little weak but (22:22 - 22:28)
i get it um (22:24 - 22:31)
it's a lot for (22:28 - 22:31)
i think where i just look at it is why (22:32 - 22:38)
stuffel why does stufful get a 400 (22:34 - 22:42)
because it doesn't have an unusual (22:38 - 22:43)
it doesn't have an unusual (22:42 - 22:47)
requirement in the game to evolve (22:43 - 22:49)
like um (22:47 - 22:50)
like yeah it just evolves at like level (22:49 - 22:53)
30 or something yeah (22:50 - 22:55)
the choices that they make for ones that (22:53 - 22:57)
are 400 (22:55 - 23:01)
outside of magikarp magikarp made sense (22:57 - 23:03)
they did they don't make sense like why (23:01 - 23:05)
is swablu 400 (23:03 - 23:07)
because it's a dragon (23:05 - 23:11)
but none of the other dragons are (23:07 - 23:11)
because it's a dragon that was a (23:13 - 23:18)
community day yeah (23:14 - 23:18)
i mean i (23:18 - 23:22)
i 100 agree with you greg but at the (23:20 - 23:25)
same time why was maureep so rare for (23:22 - 23:27)
like three years i mean whale bear there (23:25 - 23:28)
you go (23:27 - 23:32)
oh yeah walmart's 400 yeah and noibat (23:28 - 23:33)
oh yeah no i bet i still don't have (23:32 - 23:35)
annoy burn because i don't want to walk (23:33 - 23:38)
knowing that it's the the (23:35 - 23:42)
the way these choose these again are (23:38 - 23:42)
bizarre like (23:43 - 23:47)
even if you tried to make a stab in the (23:45 - 23:49)
dark as to why they chose 400 for the (23:47 - 23:51)
certain ones outside of magikarp it's a (23:49 - 23:53)
hard press to come up with reasons other (23:51 - 23:55)
than they wanted to (23:53 - 23:56)
and (23:55 - 23:58)
we'll get into this (23:56 - 24:00)
but whenever their reasons come across (23:58 - 24:02)
because we wanted to it's not going to (24:00 - 24:05)
go over well (24:02 - 24:07)
yeah (24:05 - 24:08)
they they definitely had reasons here (24:07 - 24:11)
for some things (24:08 - 24:14)
they have reasons that sound like lies (24:11 - 24:16)
i (24:14 - 24:16)
i don't think there's any like (24:17 - 24:21)
shadow network operating behind the (24:19 - 24:23)
scenes here of like trying to like (24:21 - 24:26)
convince us of something i think i think (24:23 - 24:26)
they (24:26 - 24:28)
and this is what i've learned from (24:26 - 24:30)
talking with them for the the distance (24:28 - 24:33)
that they changed (24:30 - 24:33)
they weren't really lying it's just that (24:34 - 24:38)
their their reasoning wasn't like it was (24:36 - 24:41)
a reason and it was like oh i can see i (24:38 - 24:42)
i get what you're talking about right (24:41 - 24:45)
like you want people to go out and if (24:42 - 24:47)
you want people to like spin the (24:45 - 24:49)
fountain and you can't actually see the (24:47 - 24:51)
fountain that that is a reason i don't (24:49 - 24:53)
think it's particularly good because (24:51 - 24:55)
eventually you'll be walking anyways (24:53 - 24:56)
much but much like (24:55 - 24:59)
a lot of their reasons it's easily (24:56 - 25:02)
disproven by a hundred other examples (24:59 - 25:03)
like i could be next to something and (25:02 - 25:06)
it's inside an alcove and i can't see it (25:03 - 25:08)
or i could be a (25:06 - 25:10)
a mile away i can see the eiffel tower a (25:08 - 25:12)
mile away like when you have examples (25:10 - 25:15)
that easily disprove their reasoning it (25:12 - 25:16)
means they either just didn't think (25:15 - 25:20)
about it at all which is not a good look (25:16 - 25:22)
or they made a decision and said we need (25:20 - 25:25)
a ways to justify this which is also not (25:22 - 25:27)
good and no (25:25 - 25:28)
either way that you do that and how you (25:27 - 25:30)
present that information it makes you (25:28 - 25:32)
sound like you are just lying (25:30 - 25:36)
and they are this again i read their (25:32 - 25:37)
things and i'm like (25:36 - 25:39)
if you had just left it we were testing (25:37 - 25:41)
this out great but then you had to have (25:39 - 25:43)
your director talk to the press and on (25:41 - 25:46)
twitter which undermined (25:43 - 25:48)
any goodwill you had because (25:46 - 25:49)
everything you said just makes it sound (25:48 - 25:51)
like you're lying to us (25:49 - 25:53)
i would say the the thing they're (25:51 - 25:55)
probably not saying (25:53 - 25:57)
is money (25:55 - 25:59)
and money (25:57 - 26:01)
my guess would be (25:59 - 26:04)
that they make more money in a (26:01 - 26:06)
three-hour window than the six-hour (26:04 - 26:08)
window that i think that's really what (26:06 - 26:09)
it comes down to it absolutely is (26:08 - 26:12)
because if if the six hour window was (26:09 - 26:15)
making them more money (26:12 - 26:17)
then then past communion days where you (26:15 - 26:20)
know we had three years of we had three (26:17 - 26:22)
years of three hour communities and then (26:20 - 26:24)
we have pretty much close to two years i (26:22 - 26:27)
think two years of six hour commute days (26:24 - 26:29)
and they did recently a three hour (26:27 - 26:32)
community and it probably may like let's (26:29 - 26:34)
be real here i guarantee you bubble star (26:32 - 26:36)
community probably made more money than (26:34 - 26:40)
than gibbel or spheel or (26:36 - 26:43)
sandshrew because one it's bulbasaur (26:40 - 26:46)
right what is bulbasaur but two it went (26:43 - 26:47)
back to a three hour format and they (26:46 - 26:48)
were probably like we have three years (26:47 - 26:51)
of two hours we have a brand new (26:48 - 26:53)
we're sorry three three years of three (26:51 - 26:55)
hours and a brand new three hour and all (26:53 - 26:57)
of these have made more money than six (26:55 - 26:59)
hours i bet that's the reason they're (26:57 - 27:01)
just not gonna like hey we're changing (26:59 - 27:02)
it back to three hours because we've (27:01 - 27:05)
discovered we make more money those days (27:02 - 27:06)
because they're shorter because of the (27:05 - 27:09)
fear of missing out because (27:06 - 27:13)
more people are participating um (27:09 - 27:14)
i really think that's the reason which (27:13 - 27:17)
is fine (27:14 - 27:18)
you don't have to say the reasons that (27:17 - 27:20)
we make more money you can just say (27:18 - 27:22)
we're testing this out because we want (27:20 - 27:27)
to we're trying to find the ideal (27:22 - 27:27)
situation for for our game and end it (27:27 - 27:33)
that is all you need to say but they did (27:31 - 27:35)
say that they did say we're testing this (27:33 - 27:37)
and then the director came out and was (27:35 - 27:39)
like (27:37 - 27:39)
and that (27:39 - 27:44)
so much ill will from from going on (27:41 - 27:47)
twitter and directly to the press to (27:44 - 27:49)
talk out of both sides of your mouth and (27:47 - 27:52)
undermined a much better (27:49 - 27:54)
statement of we're testing this out and (27:52 - 27:56)
then he has to go and say the garbage (27:54 - 27:58)
stuff that he said (27:56 - 27:59)
what was the garbage i didn't read that (27:58 - 28:01)
whole thing so (27:59 - 28:05)
the first thing is (28:01 - 28:07)
after seeing feedback (28:05 - 28:10)
and fans asking for this which (28:07 - 28:11)
immediately (28:10 - 28:13)
people are going to go well what fans (28:11 - 28:16)
who did you ask who did you talk to was (28:13 - 28:17)
this a survey i remember that one guy (28:16 - 28:19)
was on the plane and he sat next to john (28:17 - 28:22)
hanke and john hanke said level 40 is (28:19 - 28:24)
not where the game is starting and that (28:22 - 28:27)
only took three years to happen (28:24 - 28:27)
so when you when you go out and say well (28:27 - 28:31)
fans asked for this and then at the (28:29 - 28:34)
exact same press release tell fans but (28:31 - 28:36)
don't judge it too harshly try it out (28:34 - 28:39)
and see if you like it so which is it (28:36 - 28:41)
do you want us to accept your change or (28:39 - 28:43)
did we ask for the change and when you (28:41 - 28:45)
put both of those together it literally (28:43 - 28:46)
sounds like (28:45 - 28:48)
okay well then we didn't ask for it if (28:46 - 28:50)
you're asking us for it to not judge it (28:48 - 28:52)
until we've done it ignoring the fact (28:50 - 28:55)
that we had years of not doing it of (28:52 - 28:57)
having a shorter time before this change (28:55 - 29:00)
came in so you can't say like well you (28:57 - 29:04)
asked for it who why where where was the (29:00 - 29:06)
survey then you talk to people on (29:04 - 29:07)
twitter and you're like well we asked (29:06 - 29:09)
our influencers in our task force well (29:07 - 29:12)
that's a tiny group of people (29:09 - 29:16)
whose lives revolve around this game (29:12 - 29:18)
yeah you're going to get a very skewed (29:16 - 29:21)
opinion of what people want (29:18 - 29:23)
you didn't have to say any of that you (29:21 - 29:25)
could have just said we're testing it (29:23 - 29:28)
out when when niantic asks i don't (29:25 - 29:30)
actually remember when niantic asked (29:28 - 29:32)
the task force (29:30 - 29:34)
uh when they were going to be (29:32 - 29:36)
three six to three (29:34 - 29:38)
i know we've talked about in the show (29:36 - 29:40)
before bulbasaur community and then when (29:38 - 29:41)
bulbasaur community happened we were (29:40 - 29:42)
like (29:41 - 29:44)
they're going to pull the trigger on (29:42 - 29:45)
this further like there's no way that (29:44 - 29:47)
they're not key there's there's no way (29:45 - 29:48)
they're keeping it to six forever (29:47 - 29:50)
because if they were why is bubble store (29:48 - 29:51)
three (29:50 - 29:52)
um (29:51 - 29:55)
and i i don't remember exactly but they (29:52 - 29:57)
did ping us and they were like hey (29:55 - 30:01)
we're thinking about changing it from (29:57 - 30:04)
six to three what are your what are your (30:01 - 30:05)
and they always say this they say what (30:04 - 30:08)
are yours and your community thoughts (30:05 - 30:09)
and (30:08 - 30:10)
i don't know if this is like inside (30:09 - 30:12)
baseball (30:10 - 30:14)
but there are some task force people (30:12 - 30:16)
that are that their their community is (30:14 - 30:19)
very gbl focused or their community is (30:16 - 30:22)
very shiny hunting focused so like it (30:19 - 30:24)
doesn't really matter (30:22 - 30:26)
in my perspective what their community (30:24 - 30:27)
thoughts are because the community (30:26 - 30:30)
leader is already going to align with (30:27 - 30:32)
their community thoughts right like if (30:30 - 30:34)
your whole community is shiny hunting (30:32 - 30:35)
you're probably going to be like give me (30:34 - 30:36)
a six hour window i want as many chinese (30:35 - 30:40)
as possible if your whole community is (30:36 - 30:41)
gbl they're probably also gonna be like (30:40 - 30:43)
give me a six hour window because i need (30:41 - 30:45)
xl candy and i need to keep playing as (30:43 - 30:47)
much as possible to get excel candy (30:45 - 30:48)
right like (30:47 - 30:49)
i don't know if there's that much of a (30:48 - 30:52)
disconnect i would say um (30:49 - 30:53)
we're very lucky (30:52 - 30:55)
to have a community that does like (30:53 - 30:57)
everything and that's because i think (30:55 - 30:59)
the content i produce is everything (30:57 - 31:02)
right i am not just a pokemon go (30:59 - 31:04)
influencer i'm one of the very few (31:02 - 31:06)
people in the task force that like (31:04 - 31:08)
actually play the main series games that (31:06 - 31:10)
like actually watch the anime that (31:08 - 31:12)
follow the news i'm not saying like i'm (31:10 - 31:14)
sure like zoey two dot i'm sure she (31:12 - 31:16)
watches the like (31:14 - 31:17)
i know she plays sword and shield and (31:16 - 31:18)
stuff like right but like (31:17 - 31:21)
like her youtube channel is dedicated to (31:18 - 31:24)
pokemon go right like (31:21 - 31:26)
and my like the content i produce is (31:24 - 31:28)
everything like one day i'm competitive (31:26 - 31:29)
battling a certain shield the other day (31:28 - 31:31)
i'm playing pokemon masters right like (31:29 - 31:33)
so we have a community that (31:31 - 31:35)
some are shiny hunters some do care (31:33 - 31:38)
about gbl some play very casually right (31:35 - 31:40)
like they might only play on community (31:38 - 31:41)
day uh (31:40 - 31:44)
so (31:41 - 31:44)
they didn't like niantic never told me (31:44 - 31:49)
or maybe they did and i just missed it (31:46 - 31:50)
but they never said like hey we're (31:49 - 31:53)
pulling the trigger on (31:50 - 31:55)
three hours and it's going to be stuffle (31:53 - 31:57)
right like i woke up and this was they (31:55 - 31:59)
like sometimes tell us like a day or two (31:57 - 32:00)
early that like these things are coming (31:59 - 32:02)
like i was like oh (32:00 - 32:04)
that we're doing it now right like so (32:02 - 32:06)
when they were like three to three hours (32:04 - 32:08)
for scuffle and we're announcing it in (32:06 - 32:09)
two days (32:08 - 32:11)
like all the other influencers myself (32:09 - 32:13)
included were like (32:11 - 32:15)
this is probably going to be bad (32:13 - 32:16)
like you're probably going to get (32:15 - 32:18)
pushback from it (32:16 - 32:20)
um (32:18 - 32:23)
although my perspective is i don't think (32:20 - 32:25)
it's the end of the world i think one of (32:23 - 32:28)
the i think one of the and i want to i (32:25 - 32:29)
do want to talk about this (32:28 - 32:31)
also i want to we haven't said this yet (32:29 - 32:34)
and i think it's really really important (32:31 - 32:36)
that there are (32:34 - 32:38)
there is a conversation about people who (32:36 - 32:41)
cannot leave their house (32:38 - 32:44)
and or slash disabled people (32:41 - 32:46)
i don't want to put that conversation in (32:44 - 32:48)
the thoughts i have about community day (32:46 - 32:50)
because i think that is a different (32:48 - 32:51)
conversation and i think it's an (32:50 - 32:54)
important conversation so we're gonna (32:51 - 32:55)
just put that to the side for now but we (32:54 - 32:58)
will talk about that (32:55 - 33:00)
separately um compared to (32:58 - 33:02)
compared to this (33:00 - 33:04)
uh (33:02 - 33:04)
i (33:07 - 33:09)
i think we all knew that they were (33:08 - 33:11)
eventually going to pull the trigger on (33:09 - 33:13)
three i think they tried to softened it (33:11 - 33:15)
with by by this is the first time it's a (33:13 - 33:18)
brand new pokemon for community so (33:15 - 33:20)
there was some thought put into it of (33:18 - 33:22)
like hey if we do a brand new pokemon (33:20 - 33:24)
maybe people because they've done (33:22 - 33:27)
they've done like roselia they've done (33:24 - 33:30)
you know pokemon or sandshrew and then (33:27 - 33:32)
people get mad because or gibble and (33:30 - 33:35)
people get mad because like oh my (33:32 - 33:37)
gibble's not special anymore my roselia (33:35 - 33:40)
is not special and like like so (33:37 - 33:43)
there there was some thought into like (33:40 - 33:45)
well if we do a new pokemon we can't we (33:43 - 33:47)
don't we at least don't hear those (33:45 - 33:48)
arguments (33:47 - 33:49)
the one thing i think his name is (33:48 - 33:52)
michael yeah game director the one thing (33:49 - 33:54)
that he said that i did really like and (33:52 - 33:55)
it did (33:54 - 33:58)
it did seem pretty genuine was we want (33:55 - 34:00)
to give players the same amount of (33:58 - 34:03)
rewards in a shorter time (34:00 - 34:05)
and i've always been a fan of games (34:03 - 34:07)
respecting your time which is true like (34:05 - 34:09)
if i'm out there for six hours it is a (34:07 - 34:12)
hundred it is from start to finish the (34:09 - 34:14)
same thing and it's been from start to (34:12 - 34:16)
finish the same thing for five years you (34:14 - 34:19)
will go out there you walk in a circle (34:16 - 34:22)
until you're tired you catch pokemon one (34:19 - 34:25)
in 25 chance of being shiny so the (34:22 - 34:28)
the the both the double catch candy and (34:25 - 34:30)
the triple xp (34:28 - 34:31)
fantastic (34:30 - 34:34)
that is definitely more respecting my (34:31 - 34:36)
time on a community and the now the lure (34:34 - 34:38)
bonus thingy (34:36 - 34:40)
also fantastic you're right i could (34:38 - 34:42)
probably you're right michael i could (34:40 - 34:44)
probably get the same amount of xp in (34:42 - 34:47)
three hours (34:44 - 34:50)
instead of playing six hours (34:47 - 34:52)
and if you're giving me three hours of (34:50 - 34:54)
my time back for that same amount of xp (34:52 - 34:58)
i would get that is fantastic that is (34:54 - 34:59)
awesome (34:58 - 35:01)
because i you're right i'm already (34:59 - 35:03)
dedicating one (35:01 - 35:06)
afternoon a month going to be two i'm (35:03 - 35:09)
assuming they're going to do another (35:06 - 35:12)
classic community day (35:09 - 35:14)
like i don't think bulbasaur was a one (35:12 - 35:15)
and done i think they're gonna they're (35:14 - 35:16)
they're gonna do like a squirtle they're (35:15 - 35:18)
gonna do a charmander right like there's (35:16 - 35:20)
no way they're knocking yeah i just (35:18 - 35:21)
don't know if they're gonna do that (35:20 - 35:23)
i i have a feeling that's like a seas (35:21 - 35:24)
once a season (35:23 - 35:27)
maybe not but not every other month or (35:24 - 35:30)
every month because that (35:27 - 35:30)
but (35:33 - 35:35)
i i do really gravitate to that point (35:35 - 35:39)
and i do really like that point of like (35:37 - 35:40)
hey we want you we kind of want to (35:39 - 35:42)
respect your time a little bit instead (35:40 - 35:44)
of doing the same thing for six hours (35:42 - 35:45)
how about you do every you feel like you (35:44 - 35:47)
get everything done in three hours and (35:45 - 35:49)
to me that that feels good now the the (35:47 - 35:51)
opposite of that or the complaint there (35:49 - 35:53)
is (35:51 - 35:53)
the thing that i think people hung up on (35:53 - 35:58)
and and myself and other influencers (35:56 - 35:59)
were like uh maybe you just delete this (35:58 - 36:01)
line because i think this line is gonna (35:59 - 36:02)
do more bad than good i think you think (36:01 - 36:04)
it's gonna do good but i i think you're (36:02 - 36:06)
gonna get a lot of flack for this line (36:04 - 36:07)
was (36:06 - 36:08)
um (36:07 - 36:10)
five percent of people don't play for (36:08 - 36:13)
more than three hours (36:10 - 36:15)
which is a good statistic right yeah (36:13 - 36:19)
yeah kind of kind of like (36:15 - 36:20)
again i think i think certain (36:19 - 36:23)
communities on twitter or discord or (36:20 - 36:25)
certain communities like uh like the (36:23 - 36:27)
self i i think sometimes they forget (36:25 - 36:29)
they are such a minority (36:27 - 36:33)
um of players and and like (36:29 - 36:35)
the self-road would be like (36:33 - 36:37)
the self-road has said and i saw (36:35 - 36:39)
recently like everyone hates this no one (36:37 - 36:42)
wants this change and it's like it just (36:39 - 36:44)
gave me flashbacks to to the national (36:42 - 36:46)
decks where everyone on our slash (36:44 - 36:49)
pokemon was like no one wants this like (36:46 - 36:52)
and it's like you're such a small (36:49 - 36:53)
part (36:52 - 36:54)
of the audience (36:53 - 36:56)
but (36:54 - 36:56)
the (36:56 - 36:58)
it's an interesting statistic that like (36:56 - 37:00)
only five percent of people play for (36:58 - 37:03)
more than three hours i but the the the (37:00 - 37:07)
thing that we we told niantic is (37:03 - 37:10)
it it's the it's the flexibility in that (37:07 - 37:11)
window right it's like i can't play in (37:10 - 37:13)
the morning because i got a soccer game (37:11 - 37:15)
at night or i can play in the afternoon (37:13 - 37:17)
because i'm lazy and i'm a degenerate (37:15 - 37:19)
and i like to stay up till 4 a.m and (37:17 - 37:21)
getting up at 9 a.m is hard i'm talking (37:19 - 37:23)
about myself i like to you know i like (37:21 - 37:24)
to sleep (37:23 - 37:26)
the thing is is the the that is another (37:24 - 37:27)
one of their (37:26 - 37:29)
double out of both mouth statistics (37:27 - 37:31)
you're telling us yeah people don't play (37:29 - 37:32)
three hours but (37:31 - 37:34)
you (37:32 - 37:36)
you could have easily have said we're (37:34 - 37:37)
dropping it to five hours but during (37:36 - 37:39)
this time frame you'll get all of these (37:37 - 37:41)
extra bonuses to encourage people to do (37:39 - 37:43)
that time because just because people (37:41 - 37:45)
play only three hours (37:43 - 37:47)
doesn't answer the core question of when (37:45 - 37:49)
you drop it (37:47 - 37:51)
of what three hours were they're playing (37:49 - 37:52)
in (37:51 - 37:54)
and when you take something and say well (37:52 - 37:56)
it's only three hours so we're going to (37:54 - 37:58)
force the three hour window on you of (37:56 - 37:59)
our choosing (37:58 - 38:01)
that's the issue they're going to come (37:59 - 38:02)
with because i don't think anybody's (38:01 - 38:03)
going to disagree with yeah i only (38:02 - 38:05)
generally play three hours but it's when (38:03 - 38:07)
i can fit it in (38:05 - 38:09)
because again you're not respecting my (38:07 - 38:10)
time (38:09 - 38:12)
in a different way by saying i have to (38:10 - 38:16)
do it at this prescribed time (38:12 - 38:17)
yeah (38:16 - 38:20)
and it's it's (38:17 - 38:24)
incredibly frustrating to be like (38:20 - 38:24)
the world is different still (38:26 - 38:30)
and (38:29 - 38:32)
people who are in climates where they go (38:30 - 38:34)
indoors (38:32 - 38:35)
mall of america was having a huge (38:34 - 38:37)
problem with the three-hour flux of (38:35 - 38:38)
people coming to the point where they (38:37 - 38:41)
were looking at banning (38:38 - 38:42)
certain things from happening because (38:41 - 38:44)
the three hours was so untenable and (38:42 - 38:46)
when they got stretched out to six hours (38:44 - 38:50)
the mall relaxed and saw staffing levels (38:46 - 38:52)
were easy to do it was easy to manage (38:50 - 38:54)
the people the traffic all didn't happen (38:52 - 38:56)
in a two-hour time window where they got (38:54 - 39:00)
inundated and the mall was wrecked after (38:56 - 39:02)
so like (39:00 - 39:02)
to force it back to a thing that is not (39:02 - 39:07)
great for the communities that have to (39:06 - 39:10)
take the impact of a huge three-hour (39:07 - 39:13)
shift of a ton of people (39:10 - 39:15)
we're gonna get back to the to the areas (39:13 - 39:17)
like victory memorial wrote here (39:15 - 39:19)
shutting things down because (39:17 - 39:21)
instead of having a six-hour window and (39:19 - 39:23)
traffic being normal they're gonna get (39:21 - 39:25)
slammed again for three hours and (39:23 - 39:28)
everybody's gonna get angry oh yeah (39:25 - 39:30)
yeah i i i think it was (39:28 - 39:33)
spiel community day or which came i (39:30 - 39:34)
can't remember what community it was (39:33 - 39:36)
where it was (39:34 - 39:37)
even though it was a six-hour window at (39:36 - 39:39)
mall of america there was a k-pop event (39:37 - 39:42)
happening yeah it was the first time (39:39 - 39:44)
that i could not get a parking spot at (39:42 - 39:46)
mall america it was insane (39:44 - 39:48)
and (39:46 - 39:50)
i remember that was one of the (39:48 - 39:53)
first communities irene was going to do (39:50 - 39:56)
and like she walked in and she was (39:53 - 39:58)
that was both bulbasaur day because i (39:56 - 40:00)
couldn't make it because i was recording (39:58 - 40:02)
that day yeah you did that at community (40:00 - 40:04)
day bulbasaur and i had to do it at home (40:02 - 40:06)
yeah it felt it was like the mall was (40:04 - 40:09)
slammed it was awful it was awful it was (40:06 - 40:11)
three hours before and it's gonna be (40:09 - 40:13)
awful again um (40:11 - 40:16)
yeah so i i (40:13 - 40:21)
i do kind of side with um (40:16 - 40:23)
the the the concept of (40:21 - 40:25)
when when you do three hours you're (40:23 - 40:27)
forcing (40:25 - 40:30)
more players to play together (40:27 - 40:32)
you you because like you'll have players (40:30 - 40:36)
like me where i'll like in a six hour i (40:32 - 40:38)
can explain my community process in a (40:36 - 40:40)
six hour community day i play it for (40:38 - 40:42)
about four of those hours (40:40 - 40:44)
i it usually it's 11 to five i normally (40:42 - 40:46)
get there at noon so i miss the first (40:44 - 40:49)
hour and then i normally one (40:46 - 40:52)
for one and then i normally play till (40:49 - 40:54)
four and i leave an hour early (40:52 - 40:55)
and there's a reason i leave an hour (40:54 - 40:58)
early um and that's because (40:55 - 41:00)
no one else is playing (40:58 - 41:03)
and (41:00 - 41:03)
and i have done community days in texas (41:03 - 41:09)
in austin texas in florida (41:07 - 41:12)
in milwaukee multiple spots in milwaukee (41:09 - 41:14)
minnesota multiple spots in minnesota in (41:12 - 41:16)
seattle like i i have done communities (41:14 - 41:19)
elsewhere so i feel like i uh (41:16 - 41:20)
a variety of places so i feel like i (41:19 - 41:22)
have a (41:20 - 41:25)
pretty good grasp of quote unquote (41:22 - 41:26)
community (41:25 - 41:27)
and (41:26 - 41:30)
i think one of the arguments that i want (41:27 - 41:34)
to bring up is that people (41:30 - 41:36)
that (41:34 - 41:36)
one of the arguments is (41:36 - 41:40)
i don't care about the community i just (41:38 - 41:42)
want to play community day when i can (41:40 - 41:45)
play community day i just want to go out (41:42 - 41:46)
do it and go home i don't want to talk (41:45 - 41:48)
to anyone i don't care about the (41:46 - 41:52)
community and i think that's a really (41:48 - 41:53)
bad reason (41:52 - 41:55)
because for something called community (41:53 - 41:57)
day yes (41:55 - 42:00)
because if you are a solo player (41:57 - 42:02)
or if you are an introvert and you don't (42:00 - 42:05)
talk to anyone you should actually like (42:02 - 42:07)
the three-hour community more (42:05 - 42:11)
and the reason being is because (42:07 - 42:13)
because when you're saying i don't care (42:11 - 42:15)
about the community (42:13 - 42:18)
you are just inherently wrong (42:15 - 42:21)
when you get to the park (42:18 - 42:25)
and there are 30 stops and all 30 stops (42:21 - 42:26)
are lured up (42:25 - 42:31)
did you pay the 30 dollars to do that no (42:26 - 42:33)
somebody else did do you know who did (42:31 - 42:36)
that the community (42:33 - 42:39)
when you are walking around in the (42:36 - 42:41)
three-hour window and you don't want to (42:39 - 42:43)
talk to anyone you don't want to join a (42:41 - 42:44)
facebook group you don't want to join a (42:43 - 42:46)
discord and there's a raid (42:44 - 42:48)
and because people are out because they (42:46 - 42:50)
need to be out in that three-hour window (42:48 - 42:52)
and you join that raid and you don't get (42:50 - 42:53)
to talk to anyone and you get to get (42:52 - 42:56)
finally get your tapuley without needing (42:53 - 42:57)
to go into a discord or a facebook or (42:56 - 42:59)
try to like ask somebody around if they (42:57 - 43:00)
can do a raid (42:59 - 43:03)
that is because the community exists (43:00 - 43:05)
when niantic is forcing the community to (43:03 - 43:08)
play in a specific time (43:05 - 43:11)
you get it easy as an introvert as a as (43:08 - 43:12)
a player that doesn't want to talk to (43:11 - 43:16)
anyone so unless you are going to your (43:12 - 43:18)
park and you are the one paying all the (43:16 - 43:20)
money to lure it up (43:18 - 43:23)
you do care about the community (43:20 - 43:24)
well i mean (43:23 - 43:26)
because there's like okay i will say (43:24 - 43:27)
this the way that you're saying that is (43:26 - 43:30)
going to make people angry you you you (43:27 - 43:32)
still don't care about the community (43:30 - 43:34)
what you what you mean to say is you are (43:32 - 43:36)
benefiting from the community sure they (43:34 - 43:38)
still don't care about it you are (43:36 - 43:40)
gaining benefits from the community that (43:38 - 43:42)
you don't care about but if you went to (43:40 - 43:44)
the park and there was no lures you (43:42 - 43:45)
would you would have a significantly (43:44 - 43:46)
less experience you would have a worse (43:45 - 43:48)
experience but (43:46 - 43:50)
that still doesn't mean that they care (43:48 - 43:51)
about because if those people really (43:50 - 43:53)
want it they would pay the money right (43:51 - 43:55)
like if they're truly a solo player and (43:53 - 43:57)
they would pay the money wait you can't (43:55 - 43:58)
say that one way or the other like you (43:57 - 44:00)
you can't you can't imagine a single (43:58 - 44:02)
person going to a park and paying 30 (44:00 - 44:05)
bucks and luring it all up and then like (44:02 - 44:07)
enjoying three hours by themselves but (44:05 - 44:08)
they would also not have to lure (44:07 - 44:10)
everything up right like if they're the (44:08 - 44:11)
people in the park and they're doing one (44:10 - 44:12)
lure and they're getting their incense (44:11 - 44:14)
like it's really the same experience in (44:12 - 44:15)
spawns because there's not enough people (44:14 - 44:17)
there anyways like the more people are (44:15 - 44:18)
the more spawns that are going to be (44:17 - 44:21)
there so people can say they don't care (44:18 - 44:23)
about the community that is true they (44:21 - 44:27)
can say we can say you benefit from the (44:23 - 44:29)
community and so in a way having a (44:27 - 44:32)
shorter window means you will benefit (44:29 - 44:35)
more yes even though you never talk to (44:32 - 44:36)
them so it's not correct to say that (44:35 - 44:38)
they care about the community because (44:36 - 44:41)
they don't they benefit off of the (44:38 - 44:44)
community which is the nature of the (44:41 - 44:45)
game (44:44 - 44:47)
yeah and which is what niantic is trying (44:45 - 44:51)
to do here and they are incorrect in (44:47 - 44:54)
saying that it is better to have more (44:51 - 44:55)
people so you can interact with more (44:54 - 44:57)
people because a lot of people are very (44:55 - 45:00)
turned off that we have been to um (44:57 - 45:02)
hundreds of community days and nobody (45:00 - 45:05)
talks to each other we barely get spoken (45:02 - 45:07)
to that's not how you define interact (45:05 - 45:08)
right (45:07 - 45:09)
but we also (45:08 - 45:11)
the only time people actually interact (45:09 - 45:12)
with us is say hey why is everybody on (45:11 - 45:15)
their phones ninety percent of the time (45:12 - 45:17)
so when they say that the interaction is (45:15 - 45:20)
part of it they are again (45:17 - 45:22)
easily saying something that people will (45:20 - 45:24)
say well that isn't true when the (45:22 - 45:27)
interaction is you are benefiting from (45:24 - 45:31)
having more people taking the burden of (45:27 - 45:33)
luring and being available for raids (45:31 - 45:35)
because the interaction is not what a (45:33 - 45:37)
lot of people are looking for and we can (45:35 - 45:41)
say doesn't happen you get benefits from (45:37 - 45:44)
a lot of people being in the same place (45:41 - 45:46)
at the same time and you are gaining (45:44 - 45:48)
those benefits that is a statement that (45:46 - 45:50)
people can say yes that is true without (45:48 - 45:53)
saying no i don't talk to anybody i (45:50 - 45:54)
don't benefit from having these people (45:53 - 45:57)
around around to interact with me (45:54 - 46:00)
because i'm not interacting with them i (45:57 - 46:02)
benefit from a lot of people interacting (46:00 - 46:05)
with the game and that is a very (46:02 - 46:07)
different statement to make and not as (46:05 - 46:09)
easily as disproved or frequent to say (46:07 - 46:12)
you're just making crap up which is (46:09 - 46:12)
again (46:12 - 46:14)
whenever they come up with these things (46:12 - 46:16)
they don't message them (46:14 - 46:17)
well (46:16 - 46:20)
it just comes off as crass half the time (46:17 - 46:22)
yeah i mean and that's (46:20 - 46:24)
that's like why i leave at four and i (46:22 - 46:26)
don't stay the extra hour because even (46:24 - 46:29)
at mall of america it's like (46:26 - 46:30)
yeah you can get like four or five (46:29 - 46:31)
people in a raid (46:30 - 46:33)
but a raid at four o'clock at mall of (46:31 - 46:35)
america is different than a raid at one (46:33 - 46:36)
o'clock in all of america one o'clock in (46:35 - 46:38)
all america that raid's going to fill (46:36 - 46:40)
the 20 instantly and then it's probably (46:38 - 46:41)
gonna fill the 20 again because like (46:40 - 46:43)
will and i will be in separate raids and (46:41 - 46:45)
we'll both have 20 people in it and then (46:43 - 46:48)
near four o'clock where will and greg (46:45 - 46:50)
are like okay i'm going home because you (46:48 - 46:52)
guys we've been waiting for you for an (46:50 - 46:53)
hour that's true (46:52 - 46:57)
and then we have been walking (46:53 - 46:57)
uh (46:57 - 46:59)
and i joined a raid it's only like four (46:58 - 47:01)
or five people so (46:59 - 47:03)
first hand (47:01 - 47:05)
at least in the mall of america one of (47:03 - 47:07)
the best pla literally probably the best (47:05 - 47:08)
place to play indoors in all of america (47:07 - 47:11)
i don't know where like i don't know (47:08 - 47:13)
what other indoor place (47:11 - 47:15)
would be better another super mega mall (47:13 - 47:17)
in the canada i'm sure (47:15 - 47:19)
um (47:17 - 47:19)
but even even in that sense when you get (47:20 - 47:24)
to the end of community you don't have (47:22 - 47:26)
as many people there (47:24 - 47:27)
so (47:26 - 47:29)
i i kind of understand it i'm not not (47:27 - 47:32)
saying i think it's great to go from (47:29 - 47:34)
from because like you still get that (47:32 - 47:36)
flexibility uh like like yeah i can (47:34 - 47:38)
still enjoy community day from five to (47:36 - 47:40)
six it's just not as good as it was (47:38 - 47:41)
earlier (47:40 - 47:45)
uh i i think that (47:41 - 47:47)
i can at least see that right like even (47:45 - 47:49)
on a non-community day when i walk (47:47 - 47:53)
through the mall and i do a circle that (47:49 - 47:54)
which is about 20 minutes i would say to (47:53 - 47:56)
walk around the circle of the mall of (47:54 - 47:58)
america if i walk around the circle with (47:56 - 48:01)
no lures and no incense that is that is (47:58 - 48:02)
definitely an experience and then if i (48:01 - 48:05)
turn on an incense that is a better (48:02 - 48:07)
experience because i'm getting one (48:05 - 48:09)
pokemon every minute on top of seeing (48:07 - 48:11)
what i am seeing and then if all of (48:09 - 48:13)
those are lured up and i have an incense (48:11 - 48:15)
i'm getting an experience where i cannot (48:13 - 48:18)
catch everything fast enough (48:15 - 48:20)
and that is just the that is just the (48:18 - 48:23)
mall of america experience so i do think (48:20 - 48:24)
the (48:23 - 48:26)
forcing people to play together in an (48:24 - 48:29)
instance where everything is lured and (48:26 - 48:31)
you're probably not the person luring it (48:29 - 48:32)
up (48:31 - 48:34)
i would drop the probably you may not be (48:32 - 48:36)
the person luring them you may not be (48:34 - 48:38)
the person lowering it up i i have been (48:36 - 48:40)
to every single community i have never (48:38 - 48:42)
learned a stop because i (48:40 - 48:43)
have (48:42 - 48:45)
i have always gotten there 10 minutes (48:43 - 48:47)
late and everything is already ready to (48:45 - 48:49)
go at that time (48:47 - 48:51)
um (48:49 - 48:53)
but i have been to a community i (48:51 - 48:55)
specifically in milwaukee went to the (48:53 - 48:58)
altaria community today (48:55 - 49:00)
and i went to lake park (48:58 - 49:04)
elm grove lake park a place i played (49:00 - 49:05)
tons of times (49:04 - 49:07)
and i went there and nothing was lured (49:05 - 49:10)
no one was really playing (49:07 - 49:12)
and i i got there at like one o'clock (49:10 - 49:15)
and i was like well i'm not gonna (49:12 - 49:17)
blur like no one's here i'm not gonna (49:15 - 49:18)
like lure these up for myself i'm not (49:17 - 49:20)
gonna give niantic the money to do that (49:18 - 49:21)
like (49:20 - 49:22)
i'm just gonna (49:21 - 49:24)
get my two shinies and then leave i got (49:22 - 49:26)
enough candy like i don't i don't even (49:24 - 49:27)
remember what the bonus that day was (49:26 - 49:29)
probably double catch candy i'm assuming (49:27 - 49:33)
uh because it was altaria but (49:29 - 49:34)
but i i just didn't i just didn't like (49:33 - 49:36)
that that point and (49:34 - 49:38)
that point just didn't sit well with me (49:36 - 49:40)
of like i don't care about the community (49:38 - 49:42)
because you do and greg boarded it (49:40 - 49:44)
better than me you do benefit so (49:42 - 49:47)
greatly you don't care about it but you (49:44 - 49:50)
can't deny that you benefit from it you (49:47 - 49:52)
do benefit from the community being (49:50 - 49:56)
there ask any rural player (49:52 - 49:58)
you benefit from having a community (49:56 - 50:01)
being there whether you want to whether (49:58 - 50:02)
you want to interact with that community (50:01 - 50:05)
or not you do get a tangible benefit (50:02 - 50:08)
from having a lot of people in the same (50:05 - 50:10)
place sharing the burden (50:08 - 50:12)
and so (50:10 - 50:14)
yes to say that you don't care about the (50:12 - 50:15)
community (50:14 - 50:17)
is saying i (50:15 - 50:19)
only want to benefit from other people's (50:17 - 50:21)
work which is fine because that's (50:19 - 50:24)
literally capitalism yeah and the the (50:21 - 50:25)
lower bonus kind of stacks on top of (50:24 - 50:27)
that right like hey (50:25 - 50:29)
if a bunch of people catch things the (50:27 - 50:30)
lord is going to be activating i don't (50:29 - 50:31)
know how that's going to work at middle (50:30 - 50:33)
america is it like (50:31 - 50:35)
yeah i don't know because everything one (50:33 - 50:37)
person catches no it said if multiple (50:35 - 50:39)
people catch enough pokemon in a set (50:37 - 50:41)
time (50:39 - 50:41)
three times before like (50:42 - 50:46)
at each spot like i don't because (50:44 - 50:49)
they're all they all have lures on them (50:46 - 50:51)
and yeah so i i don't i don't know (50:49 - 50:52)
what's gonna i'm assuming it's just (50:51 - 50:54)
we're just gonna walk this been like (50:52 - 50:56)
four xps on for the rest of the day (50:54 - 50:59)
so the other thing that michael said i (50:56 - 51:00)
think this may be the last thing i agree (50:59 - 51:03)
with michael with is that their their (51:00 - 51:04)
their (51:03 - 51:06)
struggle or one of their goals is to get (51:04 - 51:10)
new people to experience community day (51:06 - 51:12)
and so (51:10 - 51:12)
if if forcing everyone to play at the (51:13 - 51:17)
same time and then it's somebody's like (51:15 - 51:19)
first community day and then like (51:17 - 51:21)
i still remember the first time i went (51:19 - 51:24)
down to chicago with will (51:21 - 51:26)
for pokemon go fest (51:24 - 51:28)
and when we got down there literally the (51:26 - 51:30)
whole city was lured up and it was lured (51:28 - 51:31)
up (51:30 - 51:33)
for that entire weekend (51:31 - 51:36)
and it was an impressive like holy cow (51:33 - 51:37)
like (51:36 - 51:39)
geez there's a lot of players here like (51:37 - 51:41)
every like we can see like 200 pokestops (51:39 - 51:43)
in the city from our (51:41 - 51:46)
phone and they're all lured up and it (51:43 - 51:47)
was (51:46 - 51:49)
crazy cool (51:47 - 51:50)
very very quick i'm like i'll never (51:49 - 51:51)
forget like that was the first time in (51:50 - 51:52)
pokemon go where like everything was (51:51 - 51:54)
just crazy (51:52 - 51:56)
um (51:54 - 51:56)
and if there are i think with most (51:57 - 52:02)
mobile games you're always trying to get (52:00 - 52:03)
a new player base (52:02 - 52:05)
so if this is and and i mean i even (52:03 - 52:07)
think to myself (52:05 - 52:08)
like (52:07 - 52:10)
if somebody's getting into pogo like (52:08 - 52:11)
where do they even start (52:10 - 52:13)
but i feel like community is a good (52:11 - 52:14)
place to start (52:13 - 52:16)
because you get to see all of these (52:14 - 52:18)
other people playing even if you're not (52:16 - 52:21)
interacting with them you get all of (52:18 - 52:24)
these bonuses you get a (52:21 - 52:26)
really good chance at shiny (52:24 - 52:27)
so (52:26 - 52:29)
i can kind of see what niantic's trying (52:27 - 52:31)
to do there i think they're i think (52:29 - 52:33)
they're over (52:31 - 52:34)
weighing the (52:33 - 52:37)
i don't see anybody else playing this (52:34 - 52:40)
game five six years into this game now (52:37 - 52:42)
and six and ten years into people (52:40 - 52:44)
playing on their phone like that is a (52:42 - 52:47)
real weak reason to justify your actions (52:44 - 52:49)
if you wanted to get new players in you (52:47 - 52:50)
would make sure that (52:49 - 52:52)
a friend should invite somebody and they (52:50 - 52:54)
can tie things together and get really (52:52 - 52:58)
good bonuses between those people (52:54 - 53:01)
but they don't emphasize it like there's (52:58 - 53:02)
not a person (53:01 - 53:05)
there's a tiny minority of people i will (53:02 - 53:06)
say this can be like i'm going to pick (53:05 - 53:07)
up (53:06 - 53:09)
i'm going to be starting this pogo game (53:07 - 53:12)
but i'm so ashamed that nobody else (53:09 - 53:14)
around me is going to play but seeing a (53:12 - 53:16)
bunch of people on their phones in a (53:14 - 53:19)
community is radically going to alter my (53:16 - 53:21)
perception of that because you still (53:19 - 53:24)
need somebody to invite that person in (53:21 - 53:26)
to make them feel welcome a part of that (53:24 - 53:28)
community instead of a hundred people in (53:26 - 53:30)
their own clique staring at their phone (53:28 - 53:32)
and what's missing from that statement (53:30 - 53:36)
is what are you giving community members (53:32 - 53:38)
to help invite new people into the (53:36 - 53:40)
community what tools are you creating to (53:38 - 53:42)
make that community connection easy none (53:40 - 53:44)
you're just shortening the window and (53:42 - 53:45)
hoping that they're going to talk to (53:44 - 53:47)
anybody and let me tell you a new person (53:45 - 53:49)
who has anxiety if they have anxiety (53:47 - 53:50)
about being seen on their phone what are (53:49 - 53:51)
they going to do when they walk into a (53:50 - 53:53)
group of people that are all in clumps (53:51 - 53:56)
by themselves staring at the phones and (53:53 - 53:57)
not talking to anybody (53:56 - 54:00)
how is that a better experience okay so (53:57 - 54:01)
is there with a bunch of people who (54:00 - 54:04)
never spoke to me (54:01 - 54:05)
i don't know i've been part of (54:04 - 54:07)
communities i've been it i've been part (54:05 - 54:10)
of red truck community i mean it kind of (54:07 - 54:10)
sucked (54:10 - 54:12)
but like (54:10 - 54:14)
big big guy in red truck organizing (54:12 - 54:16)
grades and (54:14 - 54:17)
like (54:16 - 54:19)
yeah but that was a community person (54:17 - 54:22)
making sure people get invited out that (54:19 - 54:24)
saying that we create this three (54:22 - 54:25)
hour window so i'm saying those people (54:24 - 54:26)
are out there (54:25 - 54:29)
like yeah even at victory memorial they (54:26 - 54:30)
have like you have a community there (54:29 - 54:32)
there is a community leader that they (54:30 - 54:34)
have like a tent and they give out water (54:32 - 54:35)
and they have like phone charging (54:34 - 54:38)
empower those people to do something (54:35 - 54:41)
apparently they talk to those people (54:38 - 54:43)
well we know that that's not true (54:41 - 54:45)
i i am sure niantic talked to people i (54:43 - 54:47)
mean they talked to the task force (54:45 - 54:49)
we we we gave them our feedback they (54:47 - 54:50)
just were like well we're still gonna do (54:49 - 54:53)
it right (54:50 - 54:55)
now i don't know people accepting their (54:53 - 54:57)
feedback are two vastly different things (54:55 - 54:59)
and i think they're really again (54:57 - 55:00)
overplaying this seeing a bunch of (54:59 - 55:02)
people playing together is going to (55:00 - 55:04)
suddenly convert somebody into not (55:02 - 55:05)
feeling weird about it especially since (55:04 - 55:08)
they don't really have a lot of ways in (55:05 - 55:10)
game or out of game for people to make (55:08 - 55:12)
connections and talk to each other other (55:10 - 55:15)
than you get one extra special trade on (55:12 - 55:17)
a day (55:15 - 55:17)
yeah i mean like the the like you don't (55:17 - 55:21)
talk to each other has been a problem (55:20 - 55:23)
since the beginning of the game and that (55:21 - 55:24)
but that's why i like community days (55:23 - 55:27)
right like i don't want to (55:24 - 55:29)
go into a facebook group or a discord (55:27 - 55:30)
and be like (55:29 - 55:33)
who's doing restaurant raids i just i (55:30 - 55:35)
want to show up on community as long as (55:33 - 55:36)
one restaurant raid pops in the three (55:35 - 55:38)
hours i know for sure there will be (55:36 - 55:39)
people there to do it and i don't have (55:38 - 55:40)
to talk to anyone and that's like to me (55:39 - 55:42)
that's that's a great experience right (55:40 - 55:44)
like i know but that does niantic is (55:42 - 55:47)
forcing this that's why i liked ex raids (55:44 - 55:48)
and but there were tons of people that (55:47 - 55:50)
were like i hate ex raids it's it's one (55:48 - 55:52)
o'clock in the in the afternoon i have (55:50 - 55:54)
to work okay well not every literally (55:52 - 55:56)
not everyone is nine to five i worked in (55:54 - 55:59)
a mall for five years i can tell you (55:56 - 56:01)
that people don't not everyone is nine (55:59 - 56:02)
to five because the mall was (56:01 - 56:04)
consistently busy at like two in the (56:02 - 56:06)
afternoon where why why are you people (56:04 - 56:08)
coming in to get your phone like don't (56:06 - 56:10)
you have a job no they don't (56:08 - 56:13)
not everyone is nine to five (56:10 - 56:15)
people take time people can take time (56:13 - 56:18)
off but the problem with the x-rays was (56:15 - 56:19)
things like (56:18 - 56:21)
they didn't pay attention to the timing (56:19 - 56:23)
such as we're going to have an ex raid (56:21 - 56:26)
uh on christmas day when the thing is (56:23 - 56:29)
closed and because our short our (56:26 - 56:32)
our start distance was so short nobody (56:29 - 56:34)
could get to it (56:32 - 56:36)
i blamed you waiting for that there were (56:34 - 56:38)
a bun there are a bunch of problems with (56:36 - 56:39)
that that again they don't (56:38 - 56:40)
they just (56:39 - 56:43)
they put they attack different things at (56:40 - 56:45)
angles that don't make sense and then (56:43 - 56:47)
say that this is a benefit when people (56:45 - 56:49)
can look at it and go (56:47 - 56:51)
kind of (56:49 - 56:54)
i guess (56:51 - 56:54)
yeah but i i liked ex raids in the sense (56:54 - 56:57)
of like i'm going to show up at one (56:56 - 56:58)
o'clock there are going to be other (56:57 - 57:00)
people there i don't have to talk to (56:58 - 57:01)
anyone and we're gonna do it i'm gonna (57:00 - 57:02)
go (57:01 - 57:04)
like i don't have to i don't have to (57:02 - 57:05)
like when is the restaurant i'm gonna (57:04 - 57:08)
pop like even even the last two weeks (57:05 - 57:10)
i would open my app two three times a (57:08 - 57:11)
day in my house and be like is there any (57:10 - 57:13)
rock roughs i can see six seven gyms (57:11 - 57:15)
from my house (57:13 - 57:17)
not a single rock rough i could ever see (57:15 - 57:19)
from my house obviously when i did go (57:17 - 57:20)
out to like the mall there was a rock (57:19 - 57:22)
rough i was invited to rock roughs but (57:20 - 57:24)
like (57:22 - 57:27)
i don't want this guessing game of like (57:24 - 57:29)
how often do i have to open my app just (57:27 - 57:31)
to look for a rock refereed like that's (57:29 - 57:34)
why i like the x-rays i knew exactly (57:31 - 57:35)
like i knew in two weeks at one o'clock (57:34 - 57:37)
i'm gonna go over here get deoxys i'm (57:35 - 57:39)
gonna go home in 15 minutes and i'm done (57:37 - 57:42)
like that is very respectful of my time (57:39 - 57:44)
i get that some people worked out one i (57:42 - 57:47)
don't i guess i could and some of the ex (57:44 - 57:49)
raids were at five would it be nice if (57:47 - 57:51)
like when you got invited to an exraid (57:49 - 57:53)
you could pick like one o'clock or eight (57:51 - 57:55)
o'clock yeah for sure but i don't think (57:53 - 57:57)
diantic system was good enough even with (57:55 - 57:59)
your christmas example i'm sure the (57:57 - 58:01)
thing was like pick a day exactly ten (57:59 - 58:02)
days out (58:01 - 58:04)
pick it at either one o'clock or five (58:02 - 58:07)
o'clock invite the people like i don't (58:04 - 58:10)
like like the game is so big and has so (58:07 - 58:11)
many players that (58:10 - 58:13)
the (58:11 - 58:15)
robotic service or whatever they do does (58:13 - 58:17)
put people at a disadvantage right like (58:15 - 58:18)
the christmas raid should have never (58:17 - 58:20)
happened yeah (58:18 - 58:21)
but (58:20 - 58:22)
i don't think anyone's going in being (58:21 - 58:24)
like oh if people do raids on (58:22 - 58:27)
february or december 15th they're going (58:24 - 58:29)
to be invited exactly in 10 days on (58:27 - 58:31)
christmas to a location that is (58:29 - 58:32)
unaccessible (58:31 - 58:35)
because wasn't it like it wasn't like a (58:32 - 58:37)
business center right that is a use case (58:35 - 58:39)
scenario that needs to come up in your (58:37 - 58:40)
internal discussions like what happens (58:39 - 58:42)
around holidays (58:40 - 58:43)
what happens when we have these things (58:42 - 58:45)
and how do we solve for x (58:43 - 58:47)
and when they put things out where (58:45 - 58:48)
they're like we're just ignoring solving (58:47 - 58:51)
for x we solve for q (58:48 - 58:53)
great (58:51 - 58:53)
um (58:56 - 58:58)
so i think i don't know if this (58:59 - 59:03)
can be (59:01 - 59:04)
i was gonna say i don't know if this (59:03 - 59:06)
community thing would be (59:04 - 59:08)
as big of a deal if it wasn't for an (59:06 - 59:11)
inset the incense changes which happened (59:08 - 59:13)
about a month ago (59:11 - 59:14)
uh (59:13 - 59:16)
but we need to take a break (59:14 - 59:18)
so when we come back we'll finish (59:16 - 59:19)
talking about that we also have to talk (59:18 - 59:21)
about the disability thing in pogo oh (59:19 - 59:24)
yeah we do so we will take a quick break (59:21 - 59:26)
and when we come back we'll continue (59:24 - 59:28)
talking about this (59:26 - 59:34)
and we are back from our break uh (59:28 - 59:34)
what did we leave off of oh yeah incense (59:34 - 59:39)
change (59:37 - 59:41)
so (59:39 - 59:43)
niantic changed the (59:41 - 59:47)
incense a couple times and uh my (59:43 - 59:50)
direct feedback niantic at one point was (59:47 - 59:53)
i play this game every day (59:50 - 59:54)
and i don't even remember what incense (59:53 - 59:56)
was supposed to do and you're changing (59:54 - 59:58)
it again and i don't know how many times (59:56 - 60:01)
you changed it so like (59:58 - 60:03)
if you are going to tell people you are (60:01 - 60:05)
changing the incense again you need to (60:03 - 60:09)
be very clear what's happening here (60:05 - 60:10)
and (60:09 - 60:11)
the (60:10 - 60:14)
too long didn't read is back before the (60:11 - 60:16)
pandemic the incense was (60:14 - 60:18)
30 minutes long and if you were not (60:16 - 60:21)
moving you would get a spawn (60:18 - 60:24)
uh every five minutes so you would end (60:21 - 60:25)
up getting (60:24 - 60:28)
six min six spawns for 50 i think it's (60:25 - 60:30)
400 coins i'm just gonna say 50 cents (60:28 - 60:32)
though we'll take in account that sure (60:30 - 60:34)
inflation 50 cents six pounds for 50 (60:32 - 60:36)
cents not a great deal honestly (60:34 - 60:39)
um and if you were moving you would get (60:36 - 60:40)
uh (60:39 - 60:42)
i think it was like (60:40 - 60:45)
it was it was like a spawn every minute (60:42 - 60:47)
it depends on how how like how fast you (60:45 - 60:49)
were moving to (60:47 - 60:50)
the distance or whatever (60:49 - 60:54)
um but i think you ended up getting like (60:50 - 60:57)
20 to 25 spawns if you were consistently (60:54 - 60:59)
moving with the incense (60:57 - 61:00)
i don't think it was that good but i (60:59 - 61:03)
think that's what they said anyways the (61:00 - 61:05)
the current incense situation after all (61:03 - 61:07)
the changes is the incense lasts for 90 (61:05 - 61:09)
minutes still three times the length it (61:07 - 61:11)
was before covid (61:09 - 61:13)
if you are moving (61:11 - 61:15)
um you will get one spawn a minute (61:13 - 61:17)
ideally you would then get a hundred (61:15 - 61:21)
spawns in or 90 spawns in 90 minutes if (61:17 - 61:24)
you moved the entire time for 50 cents (61:21 - 61:26)
um and then if you were not moving (61:24 - 61:29)
uh which would be people at home playing (61:26 - 61:31)
on their couch or people who cannot (61:29 - 61:33)
actually physically get up and move you (61:31 - 61:35)
would get one spawn every five minutes (61:33 - 61:36)
which is (61:35 - 61:40)
uh what 18 spawns for 50 cents i think (61:36 - 61:42)
i think uh (61:40 - 61:44)
6 12 18. yeah (61:42 - 61:46)
18 spawns for 90 minutes (61:44 - 61:50)
so people were upset about that (61:46 - 61:50)
um and i think some of that plays into (61:51 - 61:55)
the disability conversation that i want (61:54 - 61:58)
to get to but (61:55 - 62:00)
before we get there the the takeaway (61:58 - 62:03)
from i think that and from um (62:00 - 62:05)
this community today stuff (62:03 - 62:08)
is and niantic has said this before and (62:05 - 62:10)
we've talked about this before (62:08 - 62:11)
they (62:10 - 62:12)
want (62:11 - 62:14)
whether or not you agree with their (62:12 - 62:16)
vision their vision is they want you to (62:14 - 62:19)
leave your house and play this game (62:16 - 62:21)
and that is what they want and some (62:19 - 62:23)
people cannot do that and some people (62:21 - 62:25)
don't want to do that but that is that (62:23 - 62:27)
is the vision that they have (62:25 - 62:30)
and diantic has a couple games well they (62:27 - 62:32)
had a couple games they have ingress (62:30 - 62:34)
they had harry potter wizards unite they (62:32 - 62:36)
have pokemon go there's a transformer (62:34 - 62:37)
game coming out they have pikmin bloom i (62:36 - 62:40)
think maybe they have one more game but (62:37 - 62:42)
i will say (62:40 - 62:43)
that (62:42 - 62:45)
i do fall under the perfect customer for (62:43 - 62:48)
a niantic i do genuinely (62:45 - 62:49)
love (62:48 - 62:52)
leaving my house and playing the game (62:49 - 62:55)
and i have the perspective whether you (62:52 - 62:56)
agree with it or not that if i'm going (62:55 - 62:59)
to sit at home and play a pokemon game (62:56 - 63:01)
it is not going to be pokemon go it is (62:59 - 63:02)
probably going to be sort of shield or (63:01 - 63:05)
pokemon legends or (63:02 - 63:07)
pokemon snap right like (63:05 - 63:10)
i like that pokemon go offers me this (63:07 - 63:12)
experience outside of my house that (63:10 - 63:15)
other games do not offer but i do (63:12 - 63:17)
concede that there are some people that (63:15 - 63:19)
don't care about those games maybe don't (63:17 - 63:21)
have those games and they want a pokemon (63:19 - 63:23)
game that they can play at home and (63:21 - 63:24)
pokemon go seems to scratch that itch (63:23 - 63:28)
for them um but (63:24 - 63:29)
it would be (63:28 - 63:32)
foolish to say that time and time again (63:29 - 63:35)
niantic is doubling down tripling down (63:32 - 63:38)
they want you to leave your house they (63:35 - 63:40)
have made this very clear without just (63:38 - 63:43)
telling players we don't care about your (63:40 - 63:44)
at-home experience (63:43 - 63:46)
leave your house they ultimately just (63:44 - 63:47)
should say that at this point because (63:46 - 63:50)
like they should because it's honest (63:47 - 63:51)
i mean (63:50 - 63:52)
like (63:51 - 63:54)
there are so many things wrapped up in (63:52 - 63:56)
the if i'm at home i should play other (63:54 - 63:58)
games (63:56 - 64:00)
a phone is a necessity for most people (63:58 - 64:01)
in their day-to-day life (64:00 - 64:03)
and that is something that they have to (64:01 - 64:05)
budget and afford so having a pokemon (64:03 - 64:06)
game (64:05 - 64:08)
on a thing that they have to have makes (64:06 - 64:10)
easy sense (64:08 - 64:12)
to say others other pokemon games on the (64:10 - 64:13)
switching center means they have to have (64:12 - 64:16)
the expense of buying those other things (64:13 - 64:17)
for things those are luxuries that a lot (64:16 - 64:20)
of people don't have so when you say (64:17 - 64:23)
things like if i'm at home i would play (64:20 - 64:25)
these other games that is discounting a (64:23 - 64:27)
lot of people that the only thing they (64:25 - 64:29)
have to play games on is the thing they (64:27 - 64:32)
have for necessity which is their phone (64:29 - 64:34)
and even then having phone that can do (64:32 - 64:36)
those things is somewhat of a luxury but (64:34 - 64:39)
it is easier to say people have to have (64:36 - 64:42)
a phone for a wide variety of reasons in (64:39 - 64:44)
modern society so when a company says we (64:42 - 64:47)
don't care about your home experience (64:44 - 64:49)
because we think there's other things (64:47 - 64:51)
you can be doing at home you are (64:49 - 64:54)
also hitting on people whose only (64:51 - 64:55)
options (64:54 - 64:57)
are mobile phone experiences (64:55 - 65:00)
inside their house or not (64:57 - 65:02)
and that again (65:00 - 65:05)
they come across as really tone-deaf (65:02 - 65:08)
myopic thinkers it's very much a stance (65:05 - 65:10)
of well people who look and act like me (65:08 - 65:13)
who are able like me who have money like (65:10 - 65:15)
me have no problem with it so therefore (65:13 - 65:17)
nobody should have problem with it and (65:15 - 65:19)
if they do they shouldn't be our (65:17 - 65:20)
customer (65:19 - 65:23)
it's a kind of a gross statement to be (65:20 - 65:25)
standing on at this point but that's (65:23 - 65:28)
where they stand every time yeah (65:25 - 65:30)
and you make a great point and i think (65:28 - 65:31)
the thing that made me think about this (65:30 - 65:35)
more was was pikmin bloom (65:31 - 65:38)
which is another niantic game and to be (65:35 - 65:39)
completely (65:38 - 65:42)
transparent i i don't think i've ever (65:39 - 65:44)
talked to another pikmin bloom player (65:42 - 65:46)
besides the people who i've (65:44 - 65:48)
talked to who play go right like will (65:46 - 65:51)
some people might twitch like i've never (65:48 - 65:52)
been to a i'm sure there is a pikmin (65:51 - 65:54)
bloom subreddit i am sure there are (65:52 - 65:57)
pikmin bloom youtubers out there right (65:54 - 65:59)
like probably when i send my pikmin to (65:57 - 66:01)
do a mushroom mission there is a brown (65:59 - 66:03)
mushroom there is not a brown pikmin i (66:01 - 66:04)
don't know which ones i should be (66:03 - 66:06)
sending that's like going to the brown (66:04 - 66:09)
mushroom oh no wait wait (66:06 - 66:12)
i could do a pikmin podcast (66:09 - 66:12)
there's a red mushroom in pikmin bloom (66:13 - 66:16)
you send the red pikmin to the red (66:15 - 66:18)
mushroom right like there's a blue (66:16 - 66:20)
mushroom you send the blue pikmin to the (66:18 - 66:21)
there's a bra i don't know what to send (66:20 - 66:22)
the brush to anything do is hit the auto (66:21 - 66:25)
button i didn't know in pikmin bloom (66:22 - 66:26)
until like (66:25 - 66:27)
like two months in the game you could (66:26 - 66:29)
just hold the nectar i thought you had (66:27 - 66:30)
to like throw the nectar like you had to (66:29 - 66:33)
throw (66:30 - 66:33)
but anyways anyways (66:34 - 66:38)
uh i i love pikmin bloom i think it's a (66:35 - 66:39)
great game (66:38 - 66:41)
uh their community days are 24 hours by (66:39 - 66:43)
the way their communities only involve (66:41 - 66:45)
you walking 10 000 steps (66:43 - 66:47)
but the interesting thing that i thought (66:45 - 66:48)
about pikmin bloom (66:47 - 66:50)
is (66:48 - 66:53)
you cannot actually do anything in that (66:50 - 66:56)
game sitting in your house which is a (66:53 - 66:58)
little bit different than pogo pogo (66:56 - 67:01)
you can do a lot of things right you (66:58 - 67:02)
catch the couple spawns in your house (67:01 - 67:05)
you can maybe remote into some gyms um (67:02 - 67:07)
that'll cost you money though you can (67:05 - 67:10)
pop an incense that'll cost you money um (67:07 - 67:12)
like (67:10 - 67:13)
as long as you have like 400 pokeballs (67:12 - 67:15)
you're probably good for a day or two if (67:13 - 67:17)
you're only playing at home right maybe (67:15 - 67:18)
maybe you're good for a week i don't (67:17 - 67:20)
know how many pokemon you catch you can (67:18 - 67:21)
transfer pokemon you can power up (67:20 - 67:23)
pokemon you can like send gifts and (67:21 - 67:25)
receipts like you can do kind of a lot (67:23 - 67:28)
in pogo at your house (67:25 - 67:29)
in pikmin (67:28 - 67:31)
you can like (67:29 - 67:33)
maybe send some pikmin off to mushrooms (67:31 - 67:35)
but that's it like you got to wait like (67:33 - 67:37)
45 minutes for them to come back you can (67:35 - 67:39)
like maybe tell them to go get like a (67:37 - 67:40)
jar (67:39 - 67:42)
a planter or whatever but you can't do (67:40 - 67:44)
anything when that planter comes back (67:42 - 67:47)
like you really cannot do anything in (67:44 - 67:49)
that game without getting up and walking (67:47 - 67:51)
and it's kind of like (67:49 - 67:54)
i i try to take the pokemon go mindset (67:51 - 67:56)
and like i want to do this all at home (67:54 - 67:58)
and apply it to pikmin and you just (67:56 - 68:00)
can't like that game (67:58 - 68:02)
requires you to leave your house and to (68:00 - 68:03)
walk (68:02 - 68:04)
and (68:03 - 68:05)
that is (68:04 - 68:07)
like i don't know if people have gone to (68:05 - 68:09)
niantic's website they have like a three (68:07 - 68:11)
core vision like one of them is like (68:09 - 68:13)
exercise another one is community and i (68:11 - 68:15)
think the third one is the exploring (68:13 - 68:16)
which is what pikmin and harry potter (68:15 - 68:21)
and pokemon all pick but we have this (68:16 - 68:23)
budding heads of like (68:21 - 68:25)
no i want to play at home and niantic is (68:23 - 68:26)
like (68:25 - 68:29)
all of our other games say go outside we (68:26 - 68:31)
are we are telling you to go outside and (68:29 - 68:33)
play this game and if you do not want to (68:31 - 68:35)
go outside and play this game we do not (68:33 - 68:37)
care about you (68:35 - 68:39)
uh yeah i mean the key point is we do (68:37 - 68:41)
not care about you (68:39 - 68:43)
because if they cared they would make (68:41 - 68:46)
these decisions like if they like (68:43 - 68:48)
this this leads into the (68:46 - 68:49)
um (68:48 - 68:51)
you know living in a city versus living (68:49 - 68:53)
in the middle of nowhere (68:51 - 68:56)
argument like if you live in a city your (68:53 - 68:58)
pokemon go experience is significantly (68:56 - 69:00)
better than if you live in the middle of (68:58 - 69:02)
nowhere now if you lived in the middle (69:00 - 69:05)
of nowhere and you had no poke stops and (69:02 - 69:06)
you have no community (69:05 - 69:09)
you could theoretically still pop an (69:06 - 69:12)
incense and go for a walk around your (69:09 - 69:14)
neighborhood and get 90 spawns in 90 (69:12 - 69:17)
minutes you can still get the full (69:14 - 69:19)
benefit of the incense what niantic has (69:17 - 69:22)
done is they said (69:19 - 69:23)
if you live in a city or if you live in (69:22 - 69:25)
the middle of nowhere (69:23 - 69:27)
we don't care if you're at home leave (69:25 - 69:29)
your house like they they have made it (69:27 - 69:30)
very clear (69:29 - 69:32)
that like and i get it like if you live (69:30 - 69:34)
in the middle of nowhere your pokemon go (69:32 - 69:37)
experience is bad but the incense does (69:34 - 69:39)
make up for that it's just the incense (69:37 - 69:41)
has punished people who want to stay at (69:39 - 69:42)
home (69:41 - 69:44)
or who have to stay at home all right (69:42 - 69:47)
who have to stay at home like like (69:44 - 69:49)
like i'm not saying that the language (69:47 - 69:50)
that frustrates me when they use it and (69:49 - 69:52)
the language that you use that (69:50 - 69:54)
frustrates me is you always have this (69:52 - 69:57)
well they are choosing to do this (69:54 - 70:00)
and there is that mindset that this is a (69:57 - 70:02)
choice that they're making instead of a (70:00 - 70:05)
necessity for a lot of people who cannot (70:02 - 70:08)
physically do these things and the trap (70:05 - 70:10)
that they do when they talk about it in (70:08 - 70:12)
the trap that you do is you always point (70:10 - 70:15)
to these people want to do this (70:12 - 70:18)
and the conversation never is these (70:15 - 70:20)
people have to do this (70:18 - 70:22)
and you are standing there and saying (70:20 - 70:24)
well we don't care about you it's easy (70:22 - 70:27)
to think of you as lazy then us is (70:24 - 70:31)
uncaring and i hate that conversation i (70:27 - 70:34)
hate that mindset i am not saying that (70:31 - 70:35)
like (70:34 - 70:38)
if you can't get up and walk find a (70:35 - 70:40)
different game i am just pointing out (70:38 - 70:41)
that like (70:40 - 70:44)
niantic has has made it clear if in (70:41 - 70:46)
their actions that this is the kind of (70:44 - 70:48)
game they want (70:46 - 70:49)
correct but again (70:48 - 70:52)
there's a lot of people who who defend (70:49 - 70:54)
niantic's decision (70:52 - 70:56)
by saying people who stay at home are (70:54 - 70:59)
lazy or unwilling to play the game and (70:56 - 71:02)
that just it is so frustrating to me (70:59 - 71:05)
because you are you are forcing a (71:02 - 71:08)
judgment upon people who may not be able (71:05 - 71:11)
to do that for a wide variety of reasons (71:08 - 71:12)
and you are getting rid of your own (71:11 - 71:15)
responsibility of not caring about them (71:12 - 71:18)
but pretending that they're somehow lazy (71:15 - 71:20)
i don't think there's people really (71:18 - 71:22)
to move into the disability conversation (71:20 - 71:23)
i think those people should play a (71:22 - 71:25)
different game because i think pokemon (71:23 - 71:27)
go is a bad game (71:25 - 71:30)
like i think i i don't i don't think (71:27 - 71:33)
that pokemon go is a good game for those (71:30 - 71:36)
people and i think because it's niantic (71:33 - 71:38)
hasn't done anything to do it and i (71:36 - 71:40)
don't know if they can but here's the (71:38 - 71:42)
thing right like if your experience is (71:40 - 71:45)
like i can't leave the house whether you (71:42 - 71:47)
have a heart condition whether you're in (71:45 - 71:49)
a wheelchair whether you're disabled in (71:47 - 71:52)
some instances i don't think asking your (71:49 - 71:53)
like even if they didn't change the (71:52 - 71:54)
incense (71:53 - 71:57)
and even if community was six hours long (71:54 - 71:59)
i still think poco is a bad game for (71:57 - 72:01)
those people i think it's a bad game for (71:59 - 72:03)
most people i don't think asking your (72:01 - 72:05)
player to spend 50 cents to sit in your (72:03 - 72:08)
house to then get one spawn a minute and (72:05 - 72:10)
then to throw pokeballs which you will (72:08 - 72:12)
probably run out of because you probably (72:10 - 72:13)
don't have a pokestop in stop to then (72:12 - 72:16)
buy pokeballs is a lousy experience for (72:13 - 72:16)
those (72:16 - 72:19)
and i think those consumers and i feel (72:16 - 72:20)
bad for them because there's nothing (72:19 - 72:22)
they can there's nothing we can do (72:20 - 72:24)
besides give niantic feedback over and (72:22 - 72:25)
over again but (72:24 - 72:27)
you're giving niantic that money like (72:25 - 72:29)
don't yeah like (72:27 - 72:30)
this is not a good experience for you (72:29 - 72:32)
and i feel bad because they like there's (72:30 - 72:33)
something about pogo that is very (72:32 - 72:35)
addictive and very fun and like if you (72:33 - 72:38)
really like pokemon it's there but i i i (72:35 - 72:39)
think inherently (72:38 - 72:42)
giving niantic 50 cents for 90 minutes (72:39 - 72:44)
and then probably buying pokeballs and (72:42 - 72:46)
then probably buying remote raid passes (72:44 - 72:48)
i think is disrespectful that that (72:46 - 72:50)
person's wallet into that person's time (72:48 - 72:52)
but i do feel bad for those disabled (72:50 - 72:53)
people or those people who just can't (72:52 - 72:55)
leave because like look if you're lazy (72:53 - 72:57)
if you are genuine lazy and you want to (72:55 - 72:59)
play pogo in bed with a cup of coffee (72:57 - 73:00)
and a cat on you because you don't want (72:59 - 73:02)
to go to the park like (73:00 - 73:04)
pay for that convenience right i i (73:02 - 73:06)
respect that right like if (73:04 - 73:08)
if you don't want to drive to the park (73:06 - 73:10)
to do raids and you want to give niantic (73:08 - 73:11)
money for remote raid passes pay for (73:10 - 73:13)
that experience like that's all i'm not (73:11 - 73:15)
talking about you but what i'm saying (73:13 - 73:17)
from a corporate standpoint these (73:15 - 73:20)
decisions are to drive those people away (73:17 - 73:22)
right like instead of coming up (73:20 - 73:25)
solutions to make it easier for a larger (73:22 - 73:26)
base (73:25 - 73:28)
they are making deliberate corporate (73:26 - 73:31)
choices that cost people money so that (73:28 - 73:34)
they will not be customers of theirs (73:31 - 73:37)
anymore these are decisions to drive (73:34 - 73:38)
people who they do not think are (73:37 - 73:41)
desirable customers away from their app (73:38 - 73:43)
and away from their feedback (73:41 - 73:45)
it is a deliberate choice (73:43 - 73:48)
to make them leave your game to make it (73:45 - 73:50)
a bad experience that is a deliberate (73:48 - 73:53)
niantic choice and i think people need (73:50 - 73:56)
to accept that the company is making a (73:53 - 73:58)
very conscious and a very deliberate (73:56 - 74:01)
choice to drive away customers that they (73:58 - 74:03)
picked up during covet (74:01 - 74:04)
this is why they keep pushing against (74:03 - 74:06)
pokemon sleep because pokemon sleep is (74:04 - 74:08)
gonna be the answer (74:06 - 74:10)
did you get all your stuff in your sleep (74:08 - 74:12)
i don't i don't think there's like this (74:10 - 74:15)
i don't think there's this big bad (74:12 - 74:17)
motive behind niantic that's like the (74:15 - 74:19)
pokemon company and niantic we're like (74:17 - 74:21)
we need to really separate these games (74:19 - 74:22)
this is your outdoor game this is your (74:21 - 74:24)
indoor game we don't want pogo to be an (74:22 - 74:25)
indoor game because that might take away (74:24 - 74:27)
from sword and shield or or scarlet and (74:25 - 74:28)
violet i don't think that's happening (74:27 - 74:30)
behind the scenes uh i mean i would (74:28 - 74:33)
disagree i think those conversations do (74:30 - 74:35)
have what differentiates your game why (74:33 - 74:36)
should we give you resources and the one (74:35 - 74:38)
way that the pogo can say we (74:36 - 74:39)
differentiate our game (74:38 - 74:42)
is ours is an outdoor exploration game (74:39 - 74:45)
and it doesn't the problem is is that (74:42 - 74:48)
evil comes through by not thinking about (74:45 - 74:50)
it by making the this is what (74:48 - 74:52)
differentiates our game (74:50 - 74:54)
and making these choices to make sure (74:52 - 74:56)
that that differentiates stands out you (74:54 - 74:59)
aren't stopping to give thought of the (74:56 - 75:01)
things that you're doing behind or the (74:59 - 75:04)
impacts that it have it isn't (75:01 - 75:06)
because it isn't (75:04 - 75:09)
evil it is still a deliberate choice to (75:06 - 75:12)
do that because you are deliberately not (75:09 - 75:13)
considering those other points of view (75:12 - 75:15)
even though people have told you that (75:13 - 75:19)
you are focusing on how do i make this (75:15 - 75:20)
my outstanding game (75:19 - 75:24)
and you are glossing over the decisions (75:20 - 75:26)
that impact those people because that's (75:24 - 75:28)
the differentiator like the malicious (75:26 - 75:31)
intent is there because you aren't (75:28 - 75:33)
thinking about not having the malicious (75:31 - 75:36)
intent you are thinking about it in the (75:33 - 75:38)
way that you want to think about it (75:36 - 75:39)
without considering those other (75:38 - 75:43)
perspectives and by that act alone (75:39 - 75:45)
you are (75:43 - 75:47)
directly indirectly committing that act (75:45 - 75:49)
you just start deciding not to think (75:47 - 75:52)
about it and be fine with it and on a (75:49 - 75:53)
corporate level that happens (75:52 - 75:56)
literally all the time (75:53 - 75:58)
city governments when they decide that (75:56 - 76:00)
it's going to be safer to (75:58 - 76:03)
have spikes on benches over at night to (76:00 - 76:06)
keep things clean we all know that the (76:03 - 76:08)
that's a homelessness deterrent (76:06 - 76:10)
right like these are the things that you (76:08 - 76:13)
do and you couch it in phrases that keep (76:10 - 76:15)
you from feeling the culpability of the (76:13 - 76:17)
actual results of your actions on (76:15 - 76:21)
minority and less fortunate (76:17 - 76:22)
communities (76:21 - 76:24)
you can get away saying we're an outdoor (76:22 - 76:26)
game (76:24 - 76:28)
ignoring all the things that happen (76:26 - 76:30)
because you've made that a choice and (76:28 - 76:31)
you don't want to address it and so you (76:30 - 76:33)
want to come off as smelling clean and (76:31 - 76:36)
hey we said this is what our game is (76:33 - 76:38)
without ever taking the responsibility (76:36 - 76:40)
for the fact that you don't even admit (76:38 - 76:42)
that you have those conversations and (76:40 - 76:44)
you constantly build your game around (76:42 - 76:47)
punishing people who have to play like (76:44 - 76:49)
that and it is to drive them away that (76:47 - 76:51)
is the end result and whether you want (76:49 - 76:53)
to admit it or not that is the end (76:51 - 76:56)
result of your actions and i feel like (76:53 - 76:57)
that's what we've been trying to say or (76:56 - 76:59)
at least i've been trying to say on the (76:57 - 77:01)
podcast which is like i'm not saying i (76:59 - 77:03)
agree with niantic i'm just saying like (77:01 - 77:05)
through their actions oh yeah this has (77:03 - 77:07)
been very obvious that they do not care (77:05 - 77:09)
about these players correct and i would (77:07 - 77:11)
assume it's probably again it goes back (77:09 - 77:13)
to money if they could make money off (77:11 - 77:17)
these players being at home they would (77:13 - 77:18)
but they would probably have to build (77:17 - 77:20)
some sort of system to do so and they (77:18 - 77:22)
don't want to do that well i mean i (77:20 - 77:23)
think they can (77:22 - 77:25)
make money but they also don't get the (77:23 - 77:27)
they don't get the data of where you've (77:25 - 77:29)
been what stores you're around they (77:27 - 77:31)
don't get the data of you walking around (77:29 - 77:33)
and hitting their stops and seeing what (77:31 - 77:35)
stops are like they can make money at (77:33 - 77:37)
home but they aren't getting the side (77:35 - 77:39)
money of collecting the data and who (77:37 - 77:41)
you're interacting with so we have that (77:39 - 77:43)
is where the real money is so evidence (77:41 - 77:45)
that shows that they could do it (77:43 - 77:47)
differently that steve's a little wrong (77:45 - 77:48)
about (77:47 - 77:49)
because (77:48 - 77:51)
i only (77:49 - 77:53)
open pikmin bloom for three minutes (77:51 - 77:55)
every day (77:53 - 77:57)
i i go in and i i there's there's (77:55 - 77:59)
mushrooms by my house so yeah those are (77:57 - 78:01)
easy to do (77:59 - 78:02)
um (78:01 - 78:04)
and then i like do whatever (78:02 - 78:06)
pick up whatever (78:04 - 78:07)
uh (78:06 - 78:09)
was this stuff the sap (78:07 - 78:11)
nectar the nectar (78:09 - 78:14)
i give my give my pikmin nectar get (78:11 - 78:16)
petals i start the flower planting (78:14 - 78:18)
process (78:16 - 78:20)
and i i close pikmin bloom and i don't (78:18 - 78:23)
look at it again until the next day (78:20 - 78:26)
but here's the difference (78:23 - 78:29)
if i then get in my car (78:26 - 78:32)
and drive to st paul (78:29 - 78:35)
and do stuff in st paul without opening (78:32 - 78:36)
the app (78:35 - 78:38)
and drive home (78:36 - 78:41)
that entire time even though i'm driving (78:38 - 78:44)
i am planting flowers along that entire (78:41 - 78:46)
path and i am getting the credit for (78:44 - 78:48)
being near the little pots and the (78:46 - 78:50)
little fruits and everything even though (78:48 - 78:51)
i have never (78:50 - 78:53)
opened the app (78:51 - 78:56)
and the difference is with pokemon go (78:53 - 78:58)
you don't get credit for anything unless (78:56 - 79:00)
you are in some way interacting with (78:58 - 79:01)
that app (79:00 - 79:03)
so but like hatching eggs i guess but (79:01 - 79:04)
yeah (79:03 - 79:06)
but not if you're driving (79:04 - 79:08)
right right (79:06 - 79:10)
about that where they could literally (79:08 - 79:12)
just turn that off and make it (79:10 - 79:16)
tremendously easier for a lot of people (79:12 - 79:18)
and they do it for pikmin bloom but they (79:16 - 79:20)
don't do it for pokemon go i mean i (79:18 - 79:21)
expect it to be turned off for pikmin (79:20 - 79:22)
bloom (79:21 - 79:24)
soon once they figure out how to make (79:22 - 79:27)
money off of that yeah (79:24 - 79:27)
i wonder why am i turning this on (79:27 - 79:34)
like we we i have a mod in my discord (79:31 - 79:36)
and they have a heart condition (79:34 - 79:39)
and so it is very hard for them to (79:36 - 79:41)
go outside and walk (79:39 - 79:43)
and they love pogo (79:41 - 79:45)
and we so we have this disability (79:43 - 79:49)
conversation often because like (79:45 - 79:52)
i feel bad in the sense that (79:49 - 79:54)
they have to turn on it like they have (79:52 - 79:58)
to pay niantic to turn on an incense (79:54 - 80:00)
they if if they haven't left the house (79:58 - 80:02)
for a couple days they have to pay (80:00 - 80:04)
niantic for pokeballs i've played this (80:02 - 80:07)
game every day for what almost six years (80:04 - 80:09)
never have given niantic money for (80:07 - 80:11)
pokeballs ever never will give niantic (80:09 - 80:12)
money for pokeballs (80:11 - 80:15)
but again i i've always lived in a big (80:12 - 80:17)
city where if i need to go and get (80:15 - 80:19)
pokeballs i can go downtown (80:17 - 80:22)
get out park get on my car walk in a (80:19 - 80:23)
circle for 10 minutes and i have 400 (80:22 - 80:24)
pokeballs (80:23 - 80:25)
because there's just that many stops (80:24 - 80:27)
there to do it (80:25 - 80:30)
um and i would rather do that than to (80:27 - 80:32)
give niantic money like i just i'm not (80:30 - 80:33)
going to give you money for pokeballs (80:32 - 80:35)
i'm just not going to do it i just and (80:33 - 80:37)
and that's why when they (80:35 - 80:39)
when people were upset that they changed (80:37 - 80:41)
the incense from (80:39 - 80:43)
one minute to five minutes i was like (80:41 - 80:44)
why are you upset (80:43 - 80:47)
it was bad to begin with it's still bad (80:44 - 80:48)
like yeah yeah you're getting one (80:47 - 80:50)
pokemon a minute but you (80:48 - 80:52)
this is still bad you're still paying (80:50 - 80:55)
niantic to like get spawns every (80:52 - 80:57)
whatever 50 cents every 90 minutes like (80:55 - 80:59)
it adds up eventually (80:57 - 81:01)
and if you're doing that every day if (80:59 - 81:03)
you're playing 90 minutes every day 50 (81:01 - 81:05)
cents like i just think about how that (81:03 - 81:07)
money could go to a different game to (81:05 - 81:10)
give you a better experience (81:07 - 81:11)
and it sucks (81:10 - 81:13)
that pogo (81:11 - 81:15)
is so like there's just something about (81:13 - 81:17)
pogo where it's like call it like it's (81:15 - 81:19)
well it's pokemon like like people like (81:17 - 81:21)
pokemon and people like the gameplay (81:19 - 81:24)
loop that they invented or not well (81:21 - 81:26)
technically masuda invented the spinning (81:24 - 81:27)
thing (81:26 - 81:30)
it frustrates me because like i because (81:27 - 81:32)
if if (81:30 - 81:34)
i was with my mod and i would be like (81:32 - 81:36)
hey let's do community you need to be in (81:34 - 81:38)
a wheelchair i will push you like i will (81:36 - 81:39)
be the one that pushes you through the (81:38 - 81:40)
park because i want you to have that (81:39 - 81:42)
experience (81:40 - 81:43)
because like i think the at-home (81:42 - 81:46)
experience was bad before kovid i think (81:43 - 81:49)
it was slightly better because of kovid (81:46 - 81:50)
because niantic wanted to make money but (81:49 - 81:52)
i still think it was bad and that's like (81:50 - 81:53)
the thing i wanna (81:52 - 81:57)
hammer like i think if you are disabled (81:53 - 81:58)
and you're stuck at home i think you (81:57 - 81:59)
should be able to play but i think the (81:58 - 82:02)
changes they made during kovid were like (81:59 - 82:05)
serviceable at best but i still think (82:02 - 82:07)
they were bad because they all at the (82:05 - 82:09)
end of the day involved you spending (82:07 - 82:12)
money for a bad amount of enjoyment in (82:09 - 82:14)
that time i don't know maybe you were (82:12 - 82:15)
very happy with spending the 50 cents (82:14 - 82:17)
but i don't i don't think that's a good (82:15 - 82:19)
use of 50 cents i think people saw those (82:17 - 82:22)
changes as a positive step forward and (82:19 - 82:25)
did not expect them to so hardcore rear (82:22 - 82:27)
back away (82:25 - 82:29)
i think people saw those changes as a (82:27 - 82:30)
proof that they're going to make their (82:29 - 82:32)
game more accessible (82:30 - 82:34)
and then they just came out and said nah (82:32 - 82:35)
it's not for us (82:34 - 82:37)
bye (82:35 - 82:39)
and i think that (82:37 - 82:42)
that level of like just pure disrespect (82:39 - 82:45)
angers people it angers me (82:42 - 82:49)
um like i i will i i am struggling the (82:45 - 82:51)
more they talk the more they talk the (82:49 - 82:53)
more i struggle with playing that game (82:51 - 82:56)
because it is very frustrating how (82:53 - 82:59)
little they sometimes care about (82:56 - 83:01)
their community as a whole (82:59 - 83:02)
um (83:01 - 83:05)
but like i think a lot of people myself (83:02 - 83:06)
included said hey these are good steps (83:05 - 83:08)
forward you're going to start changing (83:06 - 83:09)
this game to make it more accessible to (83:08 - 83:12)
make things so that i feel more rewarded (83:09 - 83:13)
playing your game and then they just (83:12 - 83:16)
sort of spun that bus around and floored (83:13 - 83:17)
it back to where they were (83:16 - 83:19)
and then we're surprised that people (83:17 - 83:21)
were upset (83:19 - 83:22)
yeah (83:21 - 83:23)
well (83:22 - 83:26)
the other thing too is is and we and (83:23 - 83:27)
i can't remember the last time we said (83:26 - 83:29)
this but like pokemon go is such an (83:27 - 83:33)
unfair game at its core oh yeah (83:29 - 83:35)
like and that's why i said at the (83:33 - 83:36)
beginning of this conversation i played (83:35 - 83:39)
community in florida in texas in boston (83:36 - 83:42)
in milwaukee like i've (83:39 - 83:43)
i've been to japan and played pokemon go (83:42 - 83:45)
they're all different experiences right (83:43 - 83:49)
like if i (83:45 - 83:49)
if i wanted to play a comedian day in (83:49 - 83:55)
milwaukee in the summer i had two (83:52 - 83:57)
options i had elm grove lake park and i (83:55 - 83:59)
had downtown third ward and they were (83:57 - 84:02)
both very good options they were they (83:59 - 84:04)
both had great communities (84:02 - 84:06)
granted we already talked about how i (84:04 - 84:07)
don't participate in the community but (84:06 - 84:09)
they're there i see them it's cool to (84:07 - 84:09)
like (84:09 - 84:12)
you know be a part of be a part of that (84:09 - 84:13)
right like i don't have to interact but (84:12 - 84:15)
like i do feel like hey i didn't do any (84:13 - 84:17)
work here there's a bunch of blurs (84:15 - 84:18)
there's people out playing you know you (84:17 - 84:20)
hear people scream they got a shiny (84:18 - 84:22)
that's like cool at least to me (84:20 - 84:24)
um like if i was to pick (84:22 - 84:27)
an outdoor area in the united states i (84:24 - 84:30)
would probably pick boston because (84:27 - 84:32)
their public transportation is great (84:30 - 84:34)
their that city is so historic that (84:32 - 84:35)
literally every single brick on the (84:34 - 84:38)
ground there is a pokestop (84:35 - 84:40)
like it is just so (84:38 - 84:43)
it is such a great outdoor experience (84:40 - 84:45)
but the problem with boston is they have (84:43 - 84:47)
winter eight months out of the year and (84:45 - 84:50)
it's cold as heck and so like now i can (84:47 - 84:52)
go to the best place to play pokemon go (84:50 - 84:54)
which is (84:52 - 84:56)
inside at mall of america during the (84:54 - 84:58)
winter and have a fantastic experience (84:56 - 85:01)
but now if i lived in california i don't (84:58 - 85:03)
have to worry about winter at all (85:01 - 85:05)
i can like there's plenty there's the (85:03 - 85:06)
pier there's plenty of places to play in (85:05 - 85:08)
california where i could play all year (85:06 - 85:10)
long without ever having to worry about (85:08 - 85:12)
like a wedding (85:10 - 85:13)
californians would disagree with you (85:12 - 85:15)
because it's 60 degrees and that's too (85:13 - 85:17)
cold to be outside (85:15 - 85:19)
there but they have they have their own (85:17 - 85:22)
temperature scale that is wild (85:19 - 85:24)
but even even in a (85:22 - 85:27)
even in a um (85:24 - 85:31)
where you live and your weather affects (85:27 - 85:33)
your experience of playing pogo like i (85:31 - 85:35)
play pogo less (85:33 - 85:38)
in the winter months because like i have (85:35 - 85:40)
to physically go to the mall to play (85:38 - 85:42)
because playing at home sucks and i'm (85:40 - 85:43)
not going to give niantic money for that (85:42 - 85:45)
and i'm not going to walk out in 13 (85:43 - 85:46)
degrees weather around the block not (85:45 - 85:48)
because it's cold but i'll probably slip (85:46 - 85:50)
on ice and break an arm i'm not going to (85:48 - 85:52)
do that for probably also it's sometimes (85:50 - 85:55)
negative 10. and you cannot be outside (85:52 - 85:58)
you cannot be outside for a 30-minute (85:55 - 86:00)
stint and be able to interact with your (85:58 - 86:02)
phone and see (86:00 - 86:04)
and if you and okay so it's already (86:02 - 86:06)
unfair there right (86:04 - 86:09)
in in a sense of like where you live (86:06 - 86:11)
and if you were (86:09 - 86:14)
if you lived on a pokestop (86:11 - 86:16)
you would have a significantly (86:14 - 86:18)
drastically better experience than (86:16 - 86:20)
somebody who does not i cannot reach a (86:18 - 86:23)
pokestop from my house i can get to a (86:20 - 86:26)
gym it's a two-minute walk (86:23 - 86:27)
and i (86:26 - 86:28)
and the last time i tried to do it it (86:27 - 86:30)
was very icy and it kind of sucked and i (86:28 - 86:32)
was like i'm going to (86:30 - 86:33)
break my ankle just to get to this (86:32 - 86:35)
pokestop so i can get my seven-day bonus (86:33 - 86:38)
but i did it right but like (86:35 - 86:40)
if you were if whether you were disabled (86:38 - 86:43)
or not if you lived on a pokestop you (86:40 - 86:45)
just have a great you just have an (86:43 - 86:47)
amazing experience right like you can (86:45 - 86:49)
get unlimited pokeballs your spawns are (86:47 - 86:52)
probably better you could lure that stop (86:49 - 86:53)
you could uh (86:52 - 86:55)
like you could get gifts from that stop (86:53 - 86:57)
you can send gifts from that stop like (86:55 - 87:01)
just being on a pokestop alone or a j (86:57 - 87:03)
heck if you're on like two pokestops or (87:01 - 87:04)
three pokestops or you're like on a (87:03 - 87:08)
pokestop in the gym you have a (87:04 - 87:10)
miles better experience than somebody (87:08 - 87:13)
who is not and that that has been in the (87:10 - 87:17)
game since day one that those players (87:13 - 87:18)
are at a (87:17 - 87:21)
at a i don't know advantage whatever you (87:18 - 87:22)
want to call it (87:21 - 87:25)
but like that is how unfair this game (87:22 - 87:26)
has been like (87:25 - 87:28)
and it would be nice (87:26 - 87:30)
if (87:28 - 87:30)
if you were dedicated to pogo and you (87:31 - 87:35)
couldn't physically leave your house for (87:34 - 87:38)
whatever reason and you could have that (87:35 - 87:40)
advantage that like it'd be nice but (87:38 - 87:42)
then everyone would have like everyone (87:40 - 87:43)
around pokestop right like how can i (87:42 - 87:46)
trick niantic into thinking i want to i (87:43 - 87:48)
remember that now (87:46 - 87:50)
when the wayfarer thing launched (87:48 - 87:52)
where they were like you can submit a (87:50 - 87:54)
pokestop and people legit (87:52 - 87:55)
went out and built those little (87:54 - 87:57)
libraries on their front lawn because (87:55 - 87:59)
those libraries end up being pokestops (87:57 - 88:02)
so they could just submit a pokestop (87:59 - 88:03)
um (88:02 - 88:05)
i don't think any of that changes or (88:03 - 88:06)
matters it's just like laying the (88:05 - 88:09)
foundation of like this game has always (88:06 - 88:10)
been unfair (88:09 - 88:13)
and it's always been incredibly hard for (88:10 - 88:15)
niantic to balance because (88:13 - 88:17)
the world is very big (88:15 - 88:20)
um and uh and (88:17 - 88:22)
some people have it really night like i (88:20 - 88:24)
i have an advantage i live in a very big (88:22 - 88:26)
city minneapolis is what biggest 30 (88:24 - 88:28)
cities in the united states yep (88:26 - 88:31)
milwaukee was 26 biggest city boston is (88:28 - 88:33)
what like top 10 and i'm going to be (88:31 - 88:35)
doing community in boston with greg when (88:33 - 88:37)
stufful comes (88:35 - 88:38)
like (88:37 - 88:40)
where if i lived in the middle of (88:38 - 88:41)
nowhere (88:40 - 88:43)
and i was in the middle of nowhere for (88:41 - 88:46)
like a week for a friend's uh (88:43 - 88:47)
event (88:46 - 88:49)
i'd never play i would i would legit (88:47 - 88:50)
stop playing go go is probably my (88:49 - 88:52)
favorite pokemon game but if i lived in (88:50 - 88:54)
the middle of nowhere or i opened up the (88:52 - 88:56)
app and i got one spawn an hour i would (88:54 - 88:59)
stop playing the game because it's a bad (88:56 - 89:00)
game (88:59 - 89:02)
it is a good game for me (89:00 - 89:05)
because i live in a big city and i don't (89:02 - 89:07)
have a disability i (89:05 - 89:09)
completely understand and and realize (89:07 - 89:12)
that and i am a perp i i happen to be a (89:09 - 89:14)
perfect niantic customer because i'm (89:12 - 89:15)
willing to go out and walk i'm willing (89:14 - 89:18)
to give them 10 bucks a month i am i i (89:15 - 89:20)
love pokemon (89:18 - 89:23)
but they have time and time (89:20 - 89:26)
again without saying it (89:23 - 89:27)
said we don't care about we don't care (89:26 - 89:29)
about people who play at home and it (89:27 - 89:31)
sucks (89:29 - 89:31)
the direct feedback i have given to (89:32 - 89:35)
niantic (89:34 - 89:36)
is (89:35 - 89:41)
instead of punishing everyone (89:36 - 89:41)
give the people who want to play the (89:41 - 89:46)
game that you want them how you want (89:43 - 89:47)
them to play it (89:46 - 89:51)
better rewards reward those players who (89:47 - 89:54)
want to play the game how you see it fit (89:51 - 89:57)
if you want me to walk 50 kilometers a (89:54 - 90:00)
week why are my rewards so trash (89:57 - 90:02)
if you want me to go to the park for (90:00 - 90:03)
these events (90:02 - 90:05)
make it worthwhile (90:03 - 90:08)
don't i'm not saying don't take like (90:05 - 90:10)
why why are we punishing everyone like (90:08 - 90:12)
why like if people want to sit on your (90:10 - 90:14)
couch and on their couch because they (90:12 - 90:16)
either have to or (90:14 - 90:19)
they just don't want to leave (90:16 - 90:20)
let them let them give you money that's (90:19 - 90:22)
fine i i still think i still think you (90:20 - 90:24)
shouldn't give niantic money but like if (90:22 - 90:25)
they want to if they want to play at (90:24 - 90:27)
home let them play at home but why are (90:25 - 90:30)
you punishing everyone like why am i (90:27 - 90:32)
playing the game you want me to play and (90:30 - 90:35)
i still feel like i'm getting punished (90:32 - 90:35)
it's the problem with their messaging is (90:37 - 90:41)
the problem with how they design things (90:39 - 90:44)
it's just it's a top-down myopic problem (90:41 - 90:46)
that (90:44 - 90:50)
every time they do something it's so (90:46 - 90:51)
frustrating (90:50 - 90:54)
because it is (90:51 - 90:54)
it is like (90:55 - 90:59)
you could hat you have (90:57 - 91:01)
you caught lightning in a bottle and you (90:59 - 91:03)
could get the world (91:01 - 91:06)
everybody on board if you would just (91:03 - 91:08)
consider everybody but instead you are (91:06 - 91:12)
more willing to toss people aside to (91:08 - 91:13)
keep your vision pure (91:12 - 91:17)
and it is (91:13 - 91:17)
it's just (91:19 - 91:25)
i i i'm every every time they every time (91:21 - 91:27)
i'm like just (91:25 - 91:30)
stop talking just stop talking just stop (91:27 - 91:32)
you could you could have everybody just (91:30 - 91:35)
at this point put up a press release we (91:32 - 91:37)
only want you to walk nothing else (91:35 - 91:40)
matters this is our company motto like (91:37 - 91:42)
it or leave it just be honest at this (91:40 - 91:43)
point (91:42 - 91:46)
because your constant neglect your (91:43 - 91:48)
constant poor messaging (91:46 - 91:51)
are pissing off your ideal customers as (91:48 - 91:53)
well as you're not ideal customers (91:51 - 91:57)
you're just making people angry (91:53 - 92:01)
and that's not good you could have (91:57 - 92:03)
you could have had it all and instead (92:01 - 92:04)
you made a different choice and then you (92:03 - 92:07)
try to weasel out of it every time and (92:04 - 92:10)
it always fails (92:07 - 92:11)
i feel like you're about to break into (92:10 - 92:14)
some glorious summers (92:11 - 92:17)
i mean don't put it past me (92:14 - 92:17)
yeah it just sucks and it's it sucks (92:18 - 92:23)
uh (92:20 - 92:23)
i think it i think it particularly like (92:24 - 92:29)
frustrates me because i i sit in these (92:26 - 92:31)
meetings with niantic (92:29 - 92:33)
and and people like the niantic people (92:31 - 92:36)
care (92:33 - 92:37)
and i know that might be hard to believe (92:36 - 92:39)
for some people (92:37 - 92:41)
but (92:39 - 92:43)
they will never (92:41 - 92:44)
be (92:43 - 92:46)
because it's like a again i don't know (92:44 - 92:47)
how much i'm allowed to say so if i'm (92:46 - 92:50)
suddenly out of the niantic uh whatever (92:47 - 92:53)
influencer group you guys know why (92:50 - 92:56)
but it it sucks (92:53 - 92:57)
because they're at least professional (92:56 - 92:59)
enough where they refuse to (92:57 - 93:01)
they refuse to not throw anyone under (92:59 - 93:04)
the bus but but but the people i at (93:01 - 93:06)
least talk to i know they care i know (93:04 - 93:08)
they want this to be a good game i know (93:06 - 93:11)
they're actually genuine (93:08 - 93:13)
and it just seems like whether it is (93:11 - 93:17)
niantic ceos or pokemon ceos or whoever (93:13 - 93:20)
else is involved that are obviously (93:17 - 93:24)
a pay grade above these people (93:20 - 93:27)
that they cannot do what they want to do (93:24 - 93:30)
the issue is (93:27 - 93:32)
they all care i i have no doubt that (93:30 - 93:34)
they care about the game that they care (93:32 - 93:36)
about the community that they care about (93:34 - 93:37)
all these things (93:36 - 93:40)
what what is abundantly clear is they (93:37 - 93:43)
have holes in their vision and even (93:40 - 93:46)
though that has been pointed out to them (93:43 - 93:49)
they don't have a willingness to to to (93:46 - 93:51)
fill those gaps and they can't outright (93:49 - 93:53)
say it because they will get sued (93:51 - 93:55)
because there's laws about it right like (93:53 - 93:57)
you can't they can't outright say we (93:55 - 93:59)
don't care about your disabilities our (93:57 - 94:00)
game isn't for you because they'll just (93:59 - 94:02)
straight up get sued because it's (94:00 - 94:05)
discrimination so instead they do all of (94:02 - 94:06)
these they do it death by a thousand (94:05 - 94:10)
paper cuts they make it so unpleasant (94:06 - 94:13)
that you leave by your own choice (94:10 - 94:15)
and and (94:13 - 94:17)
that is (94:15 - 94:19)
when you when you can see it so clearly (94:17 - 94:22)
it your i have no doubt they have (94:19 - 94:24)
passion for the game (94:22 - 94:25)
but (94:24 - 94:28)
their passion doesn't extend to people (94:25 - 94:29)
who don't (94:28 - 94:31)
who aren't like them (94:29 - 94:34)
period (94:31 - 94:34)
they don't care (94:34 - 94:38)
yeah they care about the game and the (94:36 - 94:40)
way they want to play about the game and (94:38 - 94:42)
i absolutely believe they're probably (94:40 - 94:44)
they are probably very good people but (94:42 - 94:47)
they will only think about it in their (94:44 - 94:49)
way and benefit themselves and people (94:47 - 94:51)
like them and it's (94:49 - 94:55)
it stinks straight up it just stinks (94:51 - 94:59)
and it's really frustrating (94:55 - 94:59)
i mean i (94:59 - 95:03)
there are thousands of examples of (95:01 - 95:05)
millions of companies that clearly don't (95:03 - 95:07)
have a diversity board or people who (95:05 - 95:09)
have diverse aspects or parts of their (95:07 - 95:11)
life because there's so many things that (95:09 - 95:13)
happen you're like if you had just had a (95:11 - 95:14)
gay person in the room you would have (95:13 - 95:16)
never have said that that would have (95:14 - 95:18)
never gotten out the door (95:16 - 95:20)
but it is again you've (95:18 - 95:22)
in your hiring practices in the people (95:20 - 95:24)
you have in your feedback channels and (95:22 - 95:26)
the people you choose to listen to when (95:24 - 95:28)
you only listen to people who look like (95:26 - 95:30)
you and think like you and act like you (95:28 - 95:34)
these decisions happen (95:30 - 95:34)
just period the it's a byproduct of (95:34 - 95:40)
of an american way of doing things and (95:38 - 95:42)
they are just another company that has (95:40 - 95:43)
no (95:42 - 95:46)
apparent interest in fixing that (95:43 - 95:49)
yeah i i (95:46 - 95:49)
i sit in these niantic chats and it's (95:49 - 95:53)
like (95:52 - 95:56)
a lot of that is good and some of that (95:53 - 95:58)
good is not seen because of (95:56 - 96:01)
really dumb decisions like this (95:58 - 96:02)
and i wouldn't i don't even think the (96:01 - 96:05)
six to three hours is like (96:02 - 96:06)
that big of a deal (96:05 - 96:08)
i think the incense thing was more of (96:06 - 96:10)
like (96:08 - 96:12)
i think the incense thing is more of a (96:10 - 96:15)
bigger deal because it it is actively (96:12 - 96:17)
saying something that they refuse to say (96:15 - 96:18)
but they believe (96:17 - 96:21)
right i mean it's because like (96:18 - 96:23)
the community thing is like well i have (96:21 - 96:25)
kids or i'm busy and it's like ah (96:23 - 96:27)
everyone's busy like yeah i don't have (96:25 - 96:30)
kids but like i got stuff to do like (96:27 - 96:33)
like i remember i played destiny (96:30 - 96:35)
one with will every single night for a (96:33 - 96:38)
full year and i think to myself how did (96:35 - 96:40)
i have that much time how did will and i (96:38 - 96:41)
always (96:40 - 96:43)
be able to play two to three hours every (96:41 - 96:46)
single night and the reason i made that (96:43 - 96:49)
time is because like i cared about that (96:46 - 96:51)
right so like if you love pogo you will (96:49 - 96:54)
make the time like (96:51 - 96:55)
we're all busy (96:54 - 96:57)
we don't we get people everyone's (96:55 - 96:59)
working everyone has every not everyone (96:57 - 97:01)
but a lot of people have kids a lot of (96:59 - 97:02)
people have cats a lot of people like (97:01 - 97:05)
like we're all busy you end up making (97:02 - 97:07)
time for the thing you love so i really (97:05 - 97:09)
don't think at the end of the day the (97:07 - 97:11)
the the six hours or three hours is that (97:09 - 97:14)
big of a deal i get it sucks and (97:11 - 97:16)
niantic's answer to that was like well (97:14 - 97:19)
we we we gave them a month heads up (97:16 - 97:21)
a month heads up is very good very it (97:19 - 97:22)
would be great if it was a two months (97:21 - 97:25)
heads up be great if it wasn't for you (97:22 - 97:26)
but like (97:25 - 97:30)
the the incense uh change was to me more (97:26 - 97:32)
of a frustrating thing because their (97:30 - 97:33)
their (97:32 - 97:35)
their actions are saying something that (97:33 - 97:36)
yeah (97:35 - 97:39)
that suck the issue is the incense (97:36 - 97:41)
change is a huge effect to a smaller (97:39 - 97:42)
group of people (97:41 - 97:46)
the timing change is a small effect to a (97:42 - 97:48)
much larger amount of people that the (97:46 - 97:51)
time change affects (97:48 - 97:52)
everybody because like you said (97:51 - 97:55)
everybody is busy and instead of having (97:52 - 97:57)
flexibility that people have gotten used (97:55 - 98:00)
to they are now going to have to be like (97:57 - 98:02)
do i miss this community because my kids (98:00 - 98:04)
have soccer like you are pitting me (98:02 - 98:07)
against your game and making me choose (98:04 - 98:09)
and you didn't have to do that and the (98:07 - 98:11)
problem the thing about changing the (98:09 - 98:12)
time is it affects (98:11 - 98:15)
literally everybody the incidents would (98:12 - 98:17)
probably go quite because again you (98:15 - 98:18)
don't care about the people it affects (98:17 - 98:21)
most you have clearly stated that and (98:18 - 98:24)
the bulk of your customer base isn't (98:21 - 98:25)
going to be affected by the incense (98:24 - 98:27)
change so it's not going to have a huge (98:25 - 98:29)
impact because the people who it does (98:27 - 98:32)
impact huge are already screaming at you (98:29 - 98:34)
and you aren't listening so when you (98:32 - 98:37)
make something that affects everybody it (98:34 - 98:39)
is going to seem like a much bigger deal (98:37 - 98:42)
than it is because your entire customer (98:39 - 98:44)
base that had two years of i can come (98:42 - 98:46)
and go as i please i can schedule my (98:44 - 98:48)
life better because i can still get (98:46 - 98:52)
benefits is now back to the oh i have to (98:48 - 98:53)
choose (98:52 - 98:56)
for no reason other than your own needs (98:53 - 99:01)
of making money it's garbagey (98:56 - 99:01)
yeah (99:02 - 99:07)
i mean i did see uh an influencer (99:05 - 99:08)
suggested niantic and gosh i hope (99:07 - 99:10)
niantic never takes this feedback but (99:08 - 99:12)
they're like you (99:10 - 99:13)
they're like you should have you should (99:12 - 99:15)
have community be like the meltdown box (99:13 - 99:18)
you pop it and you pick the three hours (99:15 - 99:20)
and i think i i don't think that's good (99:18 - 99:22)
because i think it goes it not only it (99:20 - 99:23)
goes against the community thing but it (99:22 - 99:25)
brings up my point of like when you get (99:23 - 99:26)
to the park and you're getting so many (99:25 - 99:28)
benefits because you're bringing people (99:26 - 99:30)
together if i'm popping my incense at 9 (99:28 - 99:32)
00 pm because i just got off work yeah (99:30 - 99:34)
i'm getting like the the shiny stuff but (99:32 - 99:36)
like (99:34 - 99:38)
who who else is at the park at night (99:36 - 99:39)
like (99:38 - 99:40)
you're you're kind of losing that sense (99:39 - 99:43)
of like community day right you're just (99:40 - 99:45)
that's that's fundamentally that's what (99:43 - 99:46)
people have to pay attention to it's (99:45 - 99:50)
called community day not on your own day (99:46 - 99:51)
yeah it's just (99:50 - 99:54)
i i i don't know how (99:51 - 99:56)
like like pikmin gets away with it (99:54 - 99:58)
because pikmin has just walked 10 000 (99:56 - 99:59)
steps (99:58 - 100:01)
and nothing happens in that game right (99:59 - 100:04)
like you're like yeah you get bonus uh (100:01 - 100:05)
the (100:04 - 100:09)
like the thing the planters grow faster (100:05 - 100:11)
but it's so not noticeable (100:09 - 100:13)
um also it's like not that big of a deal (100:11 - 100:14)
to like grow your planters super fast (100:13 - 100:16)
like the reality in that game is like (100:14 - 100:18)
getting your pikmin to five stars is (100:16 - 100:20)
like five hearts is like the actual (100:18 - 100:21)
thing you have to do like growing them (100:20 - 100:24)
is super easy uh (100:21 - 100:24)
i i i (100:26 - 100:29)
think (100:28 - 100:32)
time aside from the six hours to three (100:29 - 100:34)
hours i think the changes they made here (100:32 - 100:36)
were a step in the right direction the (100:34 - 100:39)
double bonuses instead of a single bonus (100:36 - 100:42)
the like lured ups bonus thingy the like (100:39 - 100:44)
extra special trade i think (100:42 - 100:46)
that stuff (100:44 - 100:48)
is (100:46 - 100:50)
all like all the good things you just (100:48 - 100:51)
did (100:50 - 100:53)
instantly overlooked because of the one (100:51 - 100:55)
dumb choice you made which is (100:53 - 100:58)
six hours to three hours and it you (100:55 - 101:00)
could have had those (100:58 - 101:02)
extra bonuses in the three hour window (101:00 - 101:05)
and still kept two hours on either side (101:02 - 101:07)
you could have said five hours but these (101:05 - 101:09)
three hours you get all of these extra (101:07 - 101:11)
bonuses yeah and i'm surprised that (101:09 - 101:13)
that's not the path they went like hey (101:11 - 101:15)
between 11 to 2 the game is going to be (101:13 - 101:18)
really great if you can't make it not (101:15 - 101:20)
not that big of a deal from uh two to (101:18 - 101:21)
five (101:20 - 101:23)
like (101:21 - 101:25)
classic whatever you want to call it (101:23 - 101:26)
like the bonuses aren't as great but (101:25 - 101:28)
like you can still like pay (101:26 - 101:30)
to be fair the only the best suggestion (101:28 - 101:32)
i've heard from another influencer in (101:30 - 101:35)
the niantic thing is um have two times i (101:32 - 101:36)
have a morning and afternoon and people (101:35 - 101:37)
pick (101:36 - 101:39)
both are three hours long (101:37 - 101:40)
like hey i got soccer game in the (101:39 - 101:43)
morning so i'll pick the the four to (101:40 - 101:45)
seven (101:43 - 101:45)
but (101:45 - 101:48)
but again like there's going to be some (101:46 - 101:49)
person there's going to be some person (101:48 - 101:51)
that's like i can't both those times (101:49 - 101:52)
don't work for me (101:51 - 101:54)
it's like (101:52 - 101:57)
they're you're trying to make a game (101:54 - 101:57)
that you have an event on a weekend and (101:58 - 102:01)
you're already segregating half you're (102:00 - 102:03)
already being like well half people work (102:01 - 102:04)
on weekends like people work on weekends (102:03 - 102:05)
people some people don't some people (102:04 - 102:08)
have events like (102:05 - 102:11)
like you can't please everyone i mean (102:08 - 102:13)
there's a difference between individual (102:11 - 102:15)
circumstances (102:13 - 102:16)
and (102:15 - 102:18)
forcing everybody to choose (102:16 - 102:19)
yes (102:18 - 102:21)
like (102:19 - 102:23)
okay i'm busy on saturday like me saying (102:21 - 102:26)
i'm busy on saturday doesn't say like (102:23 - 102:28)
hey you should never have it on a (102:26 - 102:29)
saturday because some people can't make (102:28 - 102:31)
it right (102:29 - 102:33)
by knocking it down to three hours at a (102:31 - 102:35)
specific time you are literally telling (102:33 - 102:38)
everybody this is your only shot (102:35 - 102:40)
yeah okay (102:38 - 102:41)
i would say niantic was like well it (102:40 - 102:43)
worked for three years and you're like (102:41 - 102:45)
yeah i guess it did it (102:43 - 102:48)
again so many things work yeah that we (102:45 - 102:50)
just deal with because we didn't have (102:48 - 102:52)
another option it's like it's like if (102:50 - 102:55)
the main series game went back to hm's (102:52 - 102:57)
it worked for 10 years but we know (102:55 - 103:01)
better now yeah we know better now so (102:57 - 103:03)
asking us to revert is asking us to go (103:01 - 103:04)
back to brilliant diamond shining pearl (103:03 - 103:07)
and we all know that that was a failure (103:04 - 103:08)
yeah (103:07 - 103:10)
the thing that like drove me away from (103:08 - 103:12)
brilliant diamond shining pro was (103:10 - 103:14)
single-use tms (103:12 - 103:15)
like we figured this out in black and (103:14 - 103:18)
white why are we going back (103:15 - 103:21)
what fun slash benefit are we getting (103:18 - 103:23)
from this (103:21 - 103:27)
nothing um i uh (103:23 - 103:27)
i i i don't even know what feedback to (103:28 - 103:33)
give to niantic at this point (103:30 - 103:33)
no i mean there isn't any (103:35 - 103:41)
the thing is is that (103:38 - 103:41)
because i think about some of the (103:43 - 103:46)
suggestions that get are given to (103:44 - 103:48)
niantic like have it be like the mel tan (103:46 - 103:50)
box and it's like (103:48 - 103:53)
why are we wasting everyone's time (103:50 - 103:54)
like this is not a good like this is not (103:53 - 103:56)
a good suggestion (103:54 - 103:58)
i don't think so at least maybe i'm (103:56 - 104:00)
wrong but like (103:58 - 104:01)
like (104:00 - 104:03)
you're that's this doesn't solve the (104:01 - 104:05)
core problem of the game the thing is (104:03 - 104:07)
they could they could have a melt hand (104:05 - 104:09)
box type situation (104:07 - 104:12)
as well as a community day right (104:09 - 104:15)
like they could have if you can't make (104:12 - 104:18)
community day instead of paying a dollar (104:15 - 104:20)
50 for the stupid research (104:18 - 104:22)
instead here's a two dollar (104:20 - 104:24)
community day box that will open in (104:22 - 104:25)
seven days (104:24 - 104:27)
and you can pop it for the three hours (104:25 - 104:28)
that you want (104:27 - 104:31)
i mean you can have both like we get (104:28 - 104:33)
into these either or well because it's (104:31 - 104:35)
can't because communicate day is the (104:33 - 104:38)
only option switching it like they don't (104:35 - 104:41)
have to switch it they can do (104:38 - 104:42)
both (104:41 - 104:43)
and that's the thing that always (104:42 - 104:45)
frustrates me about conversations they (104:43 - 104:47)
can't even turn on like a shiny pokemon (104:45 - 104:49)
i mean they can (104:47 - 104:52)
they are they capable of doing so (104:49 - 104:54)
who knows they can't put out a pressure (104:52 - 104:56)
sleep without stepping on their own feet (104:54 - 104:59)
but like (104:56 - 105:00)
you can add (104:59 - 105:02)
options to your game that don't take (105:00 - 105:05)
away from other people and they (105:02 - 105:08)
they have this duality and so many (105:05 - 105:10)
people who talk about pokemon go have (105:08 - 105:14)
this either or mentality and it's it is (105:10 - 105:16)
it is as frustrating as (105:14 - 105:20)
if if they have equal access my access (105:16 - 105:23)
is less it's that frustrating mindset (105:20 - 105:25)
that hurts this game it hurts a lot of (105:23 - 105:27)
things but it is at always at play in (105:25 - 105:29)
pokemon go (105:27 - 105:32)
if somebody else has equal access my (105:29 - 105:34)
access is hurt if somebody else has (105:32 - 105:37)
equal access to shinies my shinies are (105:34 - 105:38)
worth less (105:37 - 105:40)
it is this bizarre (105:38 - 105:44)
frustrating mentality of when somebody (105:40 - 105:46)
else gets equality (105:44 - 105:49)
i'm diminished and i hate it i hate it (105:46 - 105:51)
with a passion because i've had to live (105:49 - 105:54)
it mm-hmm (105:51 - 105:55)
and that go then that always brings me (105:54 - 105:57)
back to the one piece of feedback i have (105:55 - 105:59)
to niantic which is if you want me to (105:57 - 106:02)
play the game a specific way reward me (105:59 - 106:04)
for it (106:02 - 106:05)
i i i (106:04 - 106:07)
and they're so they're so they're they (106:05 - 106:09)
would rather punish people to they'd (106:07 - 106:12)
rather punish everyone (106:09 - 106:14)
instead of rewarding the players that (106:12 - 106:15)
they're like (106:14 - 106:16)
i don't i don't know how many people (106:15 - 106:18)
play the game you want them to i would i (106:16 - 106:20)
don't know i don't know like i don't i (106:18 - 106:22)
if you want me to walk 50 kilometers (106:20 - 106:26)
every week why are my rewards so bad (106:22 - 106:28)
if you want me to go to the park (106:26 - 106:29)
why does it feel like i can have the (106:28 - 106:32)
same experience at home (106:29 - 106:32)
why do i feel like i'm getting punished (106:33 - 106:37)
for playing the game how you want me to (106:35 - 106:39)
play it because you're unhappy with this (106:37 - 106:41)
very small set of people that want (106:39 - 106:45)
it's really frustrating (106:41 - 106:45)
anyways uh stufful is the community day (106:48 - 106:52)
pokemon uh it's a brand new pokemon from (106:50 - 106:55)
gen 7 400 candy we did the math you'll (106:52 - 106:58)
have to catch about 33 of them with the (106:55 - 107:00)
uh pinapps (106:58 - 107:02)
uh to get yourself a beware (107:00 - 107:04)
hey stufful is a good shiny though (107:02 - 107:08)
oh it's very good shiny (107:04 - 107:08)
it is a good shiny (107:10 - 107:15)
hey to be fair (107:12 - 107:18)
they did go back on their distance (107:15 - 107:21)
changes (107:18 - 107:21)
one would think you'd learn a lesson (107:22 - 107:26)
from that (107:24 - 107:28)
and to be fair they did not go back on (107:26 - 107:31)
their incense changes uh it's been a (107:28 - 107:33)
month now (107:31 - 107:33)
but i i don't know (107:33 - 107:40)
i i i there's a there's a part of me (107:37 - 107:42)
that gets so frustrated because i love (107:40 - 107:43)
this game so much (107:42 - 107:46)
and then they make these (107:43 - 107:48)
really dumb choices (107:46 - 107:50)
and like even though i don't think i (107:48 - 107:53)
have ever popped an incense at home (107:50 - 107:56)
unless i was like (107:53 - 107:56)
streaming or making content i popped an (107:56 - 108:01)
incense at home for for the purposes of (107:58 - 108:04)
that like i i like there's just not a (108:01 - 108:06)
there's just not a part of me where i'm (108:04 - 108:07)
like i want to give niantic 50 cents and (108:06 - 108:09)
play on my couch like i just don't want (108:07 - 108:10)
to do that (108:09 - 108:12)
i mean i popped an instance when i was (108:10 - 108:13)
doing community when i had to do this (108:12 - 108:15)
for community day at home (108:13 - 108:19)
because i had no other option (108:15 - 108:19)
but like (108:20 - 108:24)
the changes they made (108:21 - 108:25)
they could be like incense is amazing at (108:24 - 108:27)
home cool i'm glad some people get to (108:25 - 108:29)
experience that i don't care (108:27 - 108:30)
because i would rather go out and play (108:29 - 108:32)
but like (108:30 - 108:35)
again the changes they are making (108:32 - 108:37)
like even though like i don't affect (108:35 - 108:39)
them it doesn't bother me (108:37 - 108:41)
and it's what you said greg it's like (108:39 - 108:43)
the people that are like oh i i did (108:41 - 108:44)
raids for gibbel and now they're doing a (108:43 - 108:46)
gimbal community this is so unfair it's (108:44 - 108:47)
like who (108:46 - 108:49)
would you care if other people get (108:47 - 108:51)
gibble like (108:49 - 108:53)
who cares like i don't care that you've (108:51 - 108:56)
invalidated my past experience (108:53 - 108:57)
like (108:56 - 108:59)
like i don't care if somebody's gonna (108:57 - 109:01)
play at home i don't wanna like i played (108:59 - 109:03)
with a friend (109:01 - 109:04)
um (109:03 - 109:05)
that (109:04 - 109:07)
the first couple community days we would (109:05 - 109:10)
go to the mall and we would play (109:07 - 109:12)
and they (109:10 - 109:15)
then discovered that another friend (109:12 - 109:17)
drove in a circle for three hours in a (109:15 - 109:20)
park like legit got in their car (109:17 - 109:24)
and drove in the circle that is the park (109:20 - 109:26)
and they got more shinies that way (109:24 - 109:29)
and the friend stopped playing with me (109:26 - 109:32)
to then sit in a car for three hours and (109:29 - 109:34)
drive in a circle (109:32 - 109:35)
and for them that was a better (109:34 - 109:36)
experience (109:35 - 109:38)
and for me i was like i don't want to do (109:36 - 109:39)
that one (109:38 - 109:41)
i don't want to sit in a car for three (109:39 - 109:43)
hours i already sit at my desk for eight (109:41 - 109:46)
hours i want to get up and walk because (109:43 - 109:49)
i like walking i like going out i like (109:46 - 109:50)
exploring (109:49 - 109:51)
um but (109:50 - 109:53)
but also like (109:51 - 109:54)
that's just not how i want to experience (109:53 - 109:57)
the game and (109:54 - 109:58)
but i don't at the end of the day i (109:57 - 110:00)
don't care if you want to sit in a car (109:58 - 110:02)
for three hours and drive in a circle (110:00 - 110:04)
and and (110:02 - 110:06)
hopefully not rear-end anybody because i (110:04 - 110:08)
know the driver is playing pogo and that (110:06 - 110:09)
was part of the reason why i didn't want (110:08 - 110:11)
to get into that car (110:09 - 110:13)
do it don't care (110:11 - 110:16)
but i like going out and i like playing (110:13 - 110:17)
and that's cool (110:16 - 110:20)
uh but like (110:17 - 110:20)
man niantic makes some dumb choices (110:22 - 110:28)
but again like the the the choices they (110:25 - 110:30)
have made have not affect me (110:28 - 110:32)
i understand that (110:30 - 110:34)
i get it (110:32 - 110:35)
but like (110:34 - 110:38)
if they never made those choices more (110:35 - 110:40)
people would have (110:38 - 110:42)
a better experience (110:40 - 110:44)
but they are they are specifically (110:42 - 110:46)
saying we don't want these people and (110:44 - 110:48)
the the entire reason i brought this up (110:46 - 110:51)
is because like i am saying it i am (110:48 - 110:54)
telling you to read between the lines of (110:51 - 110:56)
what niantic is doing because you should (110:54 - 110:58)
probably stop giving them money because (110:56 - 111:00)
they do not care about you and that (110:58 - 111:03)
sucks but do not give a company money (111:00 - 111:05)
that does not care about you maybe one (111:03 - 111:07)
day they will and i will continue to (111:05 - 111:09)
give them feedback but (111:07 - 111:11)
they have done nothing but go backwards (111:09 - 111:13)
and backwards and backwards (111:11 - 111:15)
on caring about these people and it is (111:13 - 111:18)
disheartening (111:15 - 111:18)
it sucks (111:19 - 111:23)
yep (111:20 - 111:23)
question of the week (111:27 - 111:32)
welcome to the question of the week (111:29 - 111:36)
welcome to the question of the week (111:32 - 111:36)
oh our also (111:37 - 111:43)
uh lynn from our uh discord said the (111:40 - 111:45)
butter dish is back in stock on pokemon (111:43 - 111:46)
no (111:45 - 111:48)
i don't know if i'm buying it though no (111:46 - 111:50)
you need to buy it you have to buy it i (111:48 - 111:52)
have to buy it yeah i have the salt and (111:50 - 111:54)
pepper shaker so i should that was your (111:52 - 111:56)
greatest (111:54 - 111:57)
that was the greatest regret not having (111:56 - 111:59)
the butter dish (111:57 - 112:01)
like if you do not buy this butter (111:59 - 112:02)
edition if i do not show up at your (112:01 - 112:04)
house and have butter instead butter (112:02 - 112:06)
dish i will be very disappointed and (112:04 - 112:08)
then when they come out with the (112:06 - 112:10)
the corn cob holders (112:08 - 112:13)
you'll be able to roll your corn cob on (112:10 - 112:16)
the butter dish and sprinkle it sweet (112:13 - 112:18)
corn season why is there not a corn (112:16 - 112:19)
pokemon (112:18 - 112:22)
not yet we're going to spain though yeah (112:19 - 112:23)
they got corn there (112:22 - 112:25)
they've got all the they got all the (112:23 - 112:27)
things i'm just excited for the entire (112:25 - 112:29)
section of uh scarlet and violet where (112:27 - 112:31)
we're gonna fight tauros in an arena (112:29 - 112:32)
got it (112:31 - 112:35)
uh brandon says what happens in a game (112:32 - 112:40)
to make you dislike slash get burnt out (112:35 - 112:40)
bad grind (112:41 - 112:45)
like if the only option is that grinding (112:43 - 112:48)
grind and grind and the grind isn't fun (112:45 - 112:50)
i'm out like (112:48 - 112:52)
it's what kills me it ultimately killed (112:50 - 112:55)
me in diamond and pearl remakes the (112:52 - 112:57)
grind is really bad it killed me in a (112:55 - 112:59)
lot of mmos where the only option is to (112:57 - 113:02)
grind outside and that grind isn't fun (112:59 - 113:04)
um (113:02 - 113:05)
it (113:04 - 113:07)
like i grind (113:05 - 113:10)
it by redoing (113:07 - 113:11)
um (113:10 - 113:13)
like fantast14 has a grind at the end of (113:11 - 113:15)
the game but i don't have to do that (113:13 - 113:17)
grind right like (113:15 - 113:19)
and it's a very short commitment (113:17 - 113:21)
like i get to go into a couple dungeons (113:19 - 113:24)
the dungeons are always super fun i get (113:21 - 113:26)
really good rewards and then i can be (113:24 - 113:28)
done and the grind is quick and fast and (113:26 - 113:31)
it's acceptable but if i have to go to (113:28 - 113:34)
an underground segment to find pochariso (113:31 - 113:38)
and maybe level my pokemon to level 70 (113:34 - 113:39)
so i can get past the elite four and (113:38 - 113:42)
that leveling grind takes five hours and (113:39 - 113:44)
it's not fun i'm out (113:42 - 113:46)
i'm done (113:44 - 113:48)
i'll i'll kind of agree with that and (113:46 - 113:51)
add on to it it's when (113:48 - 113:55)
like when the grind task is the same (113:51 - 113:57)
every time (113:55 - 113:59)
and it's super repetitive and you're (113:57 - 114:02)
just like you've memorized the timing (113:59 - 114:04)
and the button clicks and you're just (114:02 - 114:06)
doing the same thing each and every time (114:04 - 114:09)
right like my good example for this is (114:06 - 114:11)
monster hunter because (114:09 - 114:13)
i will hunt (114:11 - 114:16)
mizutsuni 500 times to get a mizutuni (114:13 - 114:18)
water orb (114:16 - 114:20)
which is a three percent drop because (114:18 - 114:24)
every mizutsuni hunt is different (114:20 - 114:25)
there's a (114:24 - 114:28)
possibility of a different uh monster (114:25 - 114:30)
coming into the area i can be doing it (114:28 - 114:32)
with different people (114:30 - 114:35)
it's it's always different and it's like (114:32 - 114:38)
that's what keeps me engaged (114:35 - 114:38)
yeah i would agree with both of you uh (114:38 - 114:42)
the grind that's why it's why i fell off (114:40 - 114:44)
of brilliant diamond shining pearl like (114:42 - 114:46)
i just i i (114:44 - 114:49)
tried to find different ways we did this (114:46 - 114:50)
on stream like (114:49 - 114:52)
what is going to give me the most (114:50 - 114:54)
experience how can i get to level 100 (114:52 - 114:55)
like what (114:54 - 114:57)
am i missing something in this game is (114:55 - 115:00)
this the the only option is to go to the (114:57 - 115:01)
underground and knock out hound dooms or (115:00 - 115:05)
pacharisu's or or gastrodons um (115:01 - 115:06)
is something on the surface going to (115:05 - 115:08)
give me more experience like and and (115:06 - 115:11)
there isn't at the end too long didn't (115:08 - 115:12)
rain (115:11 - 115:14)
you want to get to 100 the fastest way (115:12 - 115:17)
to do it is to knock out hound dooms um (115:14 - 115:18)
because like and before anyone says (115:17 - 115:21)
we'll grind the elite four (115:18 - 115:23)
the amount of tediousness like (115:21 - 115:26)
tedious it's very tedious it is (115:23 - 115:28)
incredibly tedious and the amount of (115:26 - 115:31)
resources you have to burn like revives (115:28 - 115:33)
or potions just to get through quickly (115:31 - 115:34)
it's just (115:33 - 115:36)
it's not worth (115:34 - 115:38)
the investment it's the same thing (115:36 - 115:40)
brilliant diamond shining pro with money (115:38 - 115:41)
like (115:40 - 115:43)
the there's two old people (115:41 - 115:45)
and there are there are other people (115:43 - 115:46)
that give you money but like the two old (115:45 - 115:49)
people like i tested it they are the (115:46 - 115:51)
best way to get money and then there's (115:49 - 115:53)
that that is the only way (115:51 - 115:55)
and (115:53 - 115:57)
and from sword and shield where you (115:55 - 115:59)
could do (115:57 - 116:01)
champion cup was was very easy (115:59 - 116:03)
you could do max raids (116:01 - 116:04)
um (116:03 - 116:06)
you could just pick up items off the (116:04 - 116:08)
ground and then sell them (116:06 - 116:09)
you could (116:08 - 116:11)
cash in your watts for (116:09 - 116:13)
for fossils or you could cash in your (116:11 - 116:15)
watts for luxury balls like there's so (116:13 - 116:17)
many different ways to make money and to (116:15 - 116:20)
get experience in those games (116:17 - 116:22)
and i think the other thing about sword (116:20 - 116:25)
and shield is even if i didn't (116:22 - 116:27)
do uh needed to do a raid (116:25 - 116:29)
um for the pokemon like the rewards were (116:27 - 116:31)
still good and it kind of brought me (116:29 - 116:32)
back to (116:31 - 116:34)
second reference to destiny (116:32 - 116:37)
where i would do a destiny raid which (116:34 - 116:39)
could be two to three hours long (116:37 - 116:40)
just because i got the joy and (116:39 - 116:43)
satisfaction of helping somebody else (116:40 - 116:45)
complete that raid like i knew i wasn't (116:43 - 116:48)
going to get any items i knew that like (116:45 - 116:50)
like i wasn't going to get any levels or (116:48 - 116:52)
experience like i might get like some (116:50 - 116:53)
stuff but nothing like super important (116:52 - 116:55)
that i couldn't get faster by doing (116:53 - 116:56)
something else in the game but there was (116:55 - 116:58)
that satisfaction of like (116:56 - 117:01)
i'm gonna help these five other people (116:58 - 117:04)
get to the end so they can get the core (117:01 - 117:06)
rewards so they can like feel that (117:04 - 117:08)
accomplishment and that to me felt great (117:06 - 117:11)
that to me felt good and worth my time (117:08 - 117:13)
even though i wasn't getting (117:11 - 117:15)
a item at the end (117:13 - 117:17)
and sword and shield kind of had that (117:15 - 117:19)
with like dynamaxx adventure or max (117:17 - 117:22)
raids obviously at a very light level (117:19 - 117:24)
compared to the complexity of a destiny (117:22 - 117:26)
raid but (117:24 - 117:28)
um there's still that like (117:26 - 117:31)
sense of being with other people (117:28 - 117:32)
it's kind of funny because we just (117:31 - 117:33)
talked two hours about pokemon go (117:32 - 117:35)
community there's like the sense of (117:33 - 117:36)
being with other people that that does (117:35 - 117:39)
feel rewarding and going to a game like (117:36 - 117:40)
brilliant diamond shining pearl it has (117:39 - 117:42)
none of that like there is (117:40 - 117:44)
there i guess you could maybe say like (117:42 - 117:47)
collecting digletts but (117:44 - 117:49)
like i can't believe that game dropped (117:47 - 117:50)
the ball that hard on like some sense of (117:49 - 117:53)
community when sword and shield really (117:50 - 117:54)
i wouldn't say knocked it out of the (117:53 - 117:57)
park but man was such a good step (117:54 - 118:01)
forward in a lot of instances (117:57 - 118:01)
uh (118:02 - 118:06)
robert says we'll do one more question (118:04 - 118:08)
robert says what advice would you give (118:06 - 118:09)
to somebody who is appearing on the (118:08 - 118:13)
podcast for the first time (118:09 - 118:13)
i mean (118:15 - 118:18)
it takes a bit to understand the ebb and (118:16 - 118:22)
flow of conversation right but (118:18 - 118:22)
don't be afraid to speak up even if you (118:22 - 118:27)
accidentally interrupt somebody like (118:24 - 118:29)
that is how actual life conversations (118:27 - 118:31)
work too (118:29 - 118:32)
so (118:31 - 118:34)
you have an opinion your opinion is as (118:32 - 118:36)
valid as the people who have been there (118:34 - 118:39)
for as long as (118:36 - 118:40)
uh (118:39 - 118:43)
you know for as long as they've been (118:40 - 118:44)
uh (118:43 - 118:46)
but you you bring (118:44 - 118:49)
your own unique personality (118:46 - 118:50)
to (118:49 - 118:50)
that (118:50 - 118:53)
instance and that is worth hearing that (118:50 - 118:55)
is worth listening to other people (118:53 - 118:57)
um i understand that talking in front of (118:55 - 118:59)
people is difficult but (118:57 - 119:01)
it's easier in a small format because (118:59 - 119:02)
you're just talking to two other people (119:01 - 119:04)
like it is just a conversation that's (119:02 - 119:06)
happening in your home with with two (119:04 - 119:08)
other people (119:06 - 119:10)
uh who are (119:08 - 119:11)
you know (119:10 - 119:14)
just people i mean (119:11 - 119:17)
steve barely wakes up so like sure have (119:14 - 119:19)
barely talked to the show will talks way (119:17 - 119:20)
too much (119:19 - 119:23)
and you know (119:20 - 119:23)
it's not it i think people think that (119:28 - 119:33)
they have to perform you don't have to (119:31 - 119:35)
perform it's better if you don't (119:33 - 119:37)
just talk (119:35 - 119:39)
like if you've been on the show for a (119:37 - 119:41)
long time you can get you can do some (119:39 - 119:43)
performative things just to make it more (119:41 - 119:44)
interesting but (119:43 - 119:47)
your new voice is the interesting thing (119:44 - 119:48)
that is happening at that moment and (119:47 - 119:51)
just let understand that you are (119:48 - 119:54)
important and worth listening to (119:51 - 119:56)
well again you're there because people (119:54 - 119:59)
want to hear from you (119:56 - 120:01)
that's you know fundamentally there's (119:59 - 120:04)
there's a basis for your being there (120:01 - 120:09)
yeah i i i guess i get the um (120:04 - 120:09)
like after after the show has (120:09 - 120:15)
ended and we get we like i open up the (120:13 - 120:17)
slack where i click on the youtube also (120:15 - 120:18)
if you're watching on youtube like (120:17 - 120:20)
subscribe share comment it would be (120:18 - 120:22)
great like 25 of people are subscribed (120:20 - 120:24)
that means 75 percent of you have not (120:22 - 120:25)
hit the subscribe stop this i hate i (120:24 - 120:27)
hate everything that's happening right (120:25 - 120:29)
now i know um anyways (120:27 - 120:32)
but like when i see people say like i (120:29 - 120:35)
agree with steve or i which is very rare (120:32 - 120:39)
or i agree with greg or i agree always (120:35 - 120:42)
like it it always even though sometimes (120:39 - 120:44)
these conversations can be frustrating (120:42 - 120:46)
because we have different perspectives (120:44 - 120:49)
um it is nice that the show (120:46 - 120:51)
isn't (120:49 - 120:53)
all of us agree like we like obviously i (120:51 - 120:55)
think we all agree that niantic has made (120:53 - 120:56)
some bad choices (120:55 - 121:00)
that's very very true um (120:56 - 121:02)
but even like uh (121:00 - 121:04)
i think last week there was uh why does (121:02 - 121:06)
steve hate diamond and pearl so much and (121:04 - 121:08)
it's true i do i do dislike that game (121:06 - 121:09)
and i i think i gave pretty good reasons (121:08 - 121:11)
why i dislike that game in the question (121:09 - 121:13)
of the week segment um but will likes (121:11 - 121:15)
that game a lot (121:13 - 121:17)
uh (121:15 - 121:20)
and when there are moments where (121:17 - 121:22)
we need to talk about the (121:20 - 121:24)
very in my opinion a few good things (121:22 - 121:25)
about diamond and pearl will will be the (121:24 - 121:29)
first to speak up right like (121:25 - 121:29)
i'm middle of look i've i've almost (121:29 - 121:35)
worked myself up (121:32 - 121:38)
to playing my copy of pearl (121:35 - 121:40)
i've almost got there i'm almost there (121:38 - 121:43)
i'm almost i'm (121:40 - 121:44)
the for a hot second it was like oh i (121:43 - 121:46)
should start it up so i can get the (121:44 - 121:49)
shaman ticket before it goes and even (121:46 - 121:50)
that wasn't enough to push yeah that (121:49 - 121:52)
wasn't enough for me either (121:50 - 121:55)
uh but yeah i also remember when um like (121:52 - 121:57)
pangu was on and pengu was like oh i've (121:55 - 121:59)
i have no interest in buying pokemon (121:57 - 122:01)
legends and like there was like a (121:59 - 122:02)
youtube comment that was like why would (122:01 - 122:03)
you have somebody on your show that (122:02 - 122:05)
doesn't even want to buy the newest (122:03 - 122:06)
pokemon game and it's (122:05 - 122:08)
i think that's a great perspective to (122:06 - 122:09)
have like (122:08 - 122:10)
like (122:09 - 122:13)
they had really good reasons to be like (122:10 - 122:15)
so far what they showed of this game (122:13 - 122:18)
does not appeal to me yep um and there's (122:15 - 122:20)
a big difference between a game coming (122:18 - 122:22)
out every five years (122:20 - 122:25)
and having right five games in one year (122:22 - 122:27)
like yeah (122:25 - 122:27)
yeah (122:28 - 122:30)
uh pokemon of the week and then we're (122:31 - 122:37)
done oh man last week's pokemon let me (122:33 - 122:39)
this is (122:37 - 122:41)
so complicated (122:39 - 122:41)
uh (122:41 - 122:43)
something about (122:41 - 122:44)
no (122:43 - 122:47)
avril lavigne is not a pokemon (122:44 - 122:49)
not with that as far as i'm aware (122:47 - 122:51)
that that woman does not age i'll tell (122:49 - 122:53)
you that much (122:51 - 122:56)
something about i kind of threw things (122:53 - 122:58)
off with talking about middle evolution (122:56 - 123:00)
pokemon (122:58 - 123:02)
uh oh wait no that's (123:00 - 123:04)
wait a minute (123:02 - 123:04)
did i (123:05 - 123:08)
no (123:06 - 123:08)
it's either weasels or cats something (123:08 - 123:11)
yeah (123:10 - 123:15)
as it wasn't weasels weasel it's it's (123:11 - 123:16)
not weasel (123:15 - 123:20)
yeah it's more of an otter anyways (123:16 - 123:20)
but i don't know if that's right (123:21 - 123:26)
it could be i i actually wrote down the (123:24 - 123:28)
end and then i didn't finish what i was (123:26 - 123:29)
writing so i have no idea what i was (123:28 - 123:33)
writing actually i would be real honest (123:29 - 123:33)
it's pincer (123:35 - 123:40)
well that's also not a weasel uh it's (123:37 - 123:42)
man foo because the last sentence was (123:40 - 123:44)
for this week's pokemon we are concerned (123:42 - 123:48)
with the kung fu version not the shaolin (123:44 - 123:48)
i mean i had the start (123:49 - 123:53)
i just didn't finish i actually wrote f (123:51 - 123:55)
and then i wrote an s after it because (123:53 - 123:56)
at some point i was going to go back and (123:55 - 123:57)
listen (123:56 - 123:59)
i don't i should know that i'm never (123:57 - 124:00)
going to do that (123:59 - 124:03)
hey can we not care about manfu real (124:00 - 124:05)
quick and (124:03 - 124:07)
switch gears and i just want to say (124:05 - 124:09)
just want to say (124:07 - 124:11)
that there's a bunch of things going (124:09 - 124:13)
around recently that like gen 9 is going (124:11 - 124:15)
to have a new eevee evolution this has (124:13 - 124:17)
nothing to do with men food i just want (124:15 - 124:19)
to i just want to bring this up (124:17 - 124:20)
uh (124:19 - 124:22)
and i will say every generation there's (124:20 - 124:24)
like there's going to be a new eevee (124:22 - 124:26)
because of xyz (124:24 - 124:28)
the main reason why people think there's (124:26 - 124:32)
going to be a new eevee evolution (124:28 - 124:35)
for gen 9 is because chloe in pokemon (124:32 - 124:37)
journeys gets (124:35 - 124:40)
and the eevee refuses to evolve like (124:37 - 124:42)
before she even gets the eevee there's (124:40 - 124:43)
like a lab and they're like trying to (124:42 - 124:45)
evolve the eevee and the eevee refuses (124:43 - 124:46)
to evolve they like try to evolve the (124:45 - 124:48)
eevee into like a vaporeon and then to (124:46 - 124:49)
like a jolteon and like the eevee (124:48 - 124:50)
doesn't evolve (124:49 - 124:52)
and then at the end of the episode the (124:50 - 124:54)
eevee decides to go with chloe and (124:52 - 124:56)
there's i'm a couple episodes in and (124:54 - 124:57)
like (124:56 - 124:59)
she she again like asks evie if it wants (124:57 - 125:01)
to evolve into vaporeon and the evie's (124:59 - 125:03)
like no and so people are like (125:01 - 125:04)
speculating because the eevee is (125:03 - 125:07)
refusing to evolve that it's going to (125:04 - 125:11)
lead to a new evolution uh (125:07 - 125:13)
you get you're all a dumb (125:11 - 125:16)
like you're all big dum-dums like like (125:13 - 125:21)
in a generation that introduced dynamics (125:16 - 125:23)
the eevee is leading up to then (125:21 - 125:25)
gigantamax that's the whole thing (125:23 - 125:27)
they're leading to it's not a new eevee (125:25 - 125:30)
evolution it's if the eevee evolves it (125:27 - 125:32)
cannot giganta max there is no (125:30 - 125:34)
gigantomax umbreon there is a gigantomax (125:32 - 125:37)
eevee so if you see any of these youtube (125:34 - 125:40)
videos or theories about like oh the (125:37 - 125:43)
pokemon anime is leading to a new uh a (125:40 - 125:45)
new evie no it's leading to her eevee (125:43 - 125:49)
being able to gigantomax it's the whole (125:45 - 125:51)
did evie have a special z-move too that (125:49 - 125:53)
had all the eeveelutions coming yes yes (125:51 - 125:55)
yeah okay okay i was like awesome (125:53 - 125:58)
because a lot lana gets an eevee inside (125:55 - 126:00)
yeah in the initial trailer for (125:58 - 126:03)
scarlet and violet in the that big (126:00 - 126:05)
circle in the square that has all the (126:03 - 126:07)
different type symbols there was not a (126:05 - 126:09)
new type symbol (126:07 - 126:12)
yeah yeah i mean like (126:09 - 126:12)
sylveon existed to introduce fairy type (126:12 - 126:18)
like leafeon and glaceon (126:14 - 126:21)
gen 4 was nothing but like making gen 1 (126:18 - 126:23)
fans happy that's literally all it is (126:21 - 126:24)
like once you accept that you'll (126:23 - 126:27)
understand why gen 4 exists like (126:24 - 126:27)
uh the man who (126:28 - 126:33)
shuffle is very very good (126:30 - 126:35)
very concerned look also one of the best (126:33 - 126:37)
shinies in the game i think (126:35 - 126:39)
also if you want to time stamp this and (126:37 - 126:41)
the eevee doesn't gigantomax and there (126:39 - 126:43)
isn't an eevee i'm gladly to accept i'm (126:41 - 126:45)
wrong but like i'm gonna be hard-pressed (126:43 - 126:47)
if this ev does not gigantomax in the (126:45 - 126:51)
next like 30 or 40 episodes (126:47 - 126:51)
is it no trivius (126:52 - 126:56)
no there's no trivia that's why we (126:54 - 126:59)
rain food is so boring we need to talk (126:56 - 127:00)
about evie (126:59 - 127:01)
i mean (127:00 - 127:04)
may be a combination of ermine and kung (127:01 - 127:05)
fu (127:04 - 127:07)
sure (127:05 - 127:08)
why not (127:07 - 127:10)
well or mean i suppose all right this (127:08 - 127:12)
week's is better (127:10 - 127:14)
maybe (127:12 - 127:14)
most baby pokemon can either evolve once (127:15 - 127:21)
into its final evolution or twice once (127:18 - 127:23)
into a middle evolution and then again (127:21 - 127:25)
into a final evolution (127:23 - 127:28)
sometimes a baby pokemon can evolve into (127:25 - 127:31)
one of two different forms mime junior (127:28 - 127:34)
and toxil as examples (127:31 - 127:37)
there is only one baby pokemon though (127:34 - 127:39)
that has the potential to evolve into (127:37 - 127:41)
three different pokemon (127:39 - 127:44)
in breeding each of these three pokemon (127:41 - 127:48)
will produce the same baby pokemon (127:44 - 127:50)
no incense is required though as this (127:48 - 127:53)
baby pokemon did not exist prior to (127:50 - 127:56)
breeding mechanics becoming available (127:53 - 127:58)
if you are going to breed for this (127:56 - 128:01)
pokemon family you will need to employ a (127:58 - 128:04)
ditto although grandfather father and (128:01 - 128:06)
child may all be different pokemon none (128:04 - 128:11)
of them can ever grow up to be a mother (128:06 - 128:11)
there that's so easy (128:11 - 128:16)
i think i know what it is (128:13 - 128:17)
you always say that and that you're (128:16 - 128:19)
always wrong (128:17 - 128:20)
you so you're saying pincer was not (128:19 - 128:24)
