uh known Magic the Gathering cheater (1:09 - 1:13)
Greg (1:12 - 1:16)
how what when did I change I saw what (1:13 - 1:19)
you did to Vince last night Vince you (1:16 - 1:24)
made him give up and cry well look he (1:19 - 1:26)
was like there's nothing I can do I (1:24 - 1:30)
submit there was there was the (1:26 - 1:31)
possibility that that game could have (1:30 - 1:33)
gone on (1:31 - 1:35)
for another hour (1:33 - 1:39)
or Vince could have given up which I (1:35 - 1:40)
looked at him and said just let me win (1:39 - 1:42)
because he was going to do a thing where (1:40 - 1:44)
we swapped everything out of our (1:42 - 1:45)
graveyards and put them and I'm like I (1:44 - 1:47)
have a million things in my gravy right (1:45 - 1:48)
now because you kept destroying (1:47 - 1:50)
everything so like he's like I don't (1:48 - 1:51)
want to do the math I'm like I don't (1:50 - 1:53)
want to either (1:51 - 1:54)
so (1:53 - 1:58)
he won the first two games I almost got (1:54 - 2:01)
Grist to work last night what did you do (1:58 - 2:05)
25 damage in one oh that was a good one (2:01 - 2:07)
Brian was talking about that for on and (2:05 - 2:10)
on but also with us this week one of the (2:07 - 2:13)
last four people including myself on be (2:10 - 2:16)
real ow (2:13 - 2:19)
L do you also have yes uh Haley and Jude (2:16 - 2:21)
on your b-real because I mean we're only (2:19 - 2:23)
the last four people here (2:21 - 2:26)
I don't I actually have a few few people (2:23 - 2:29)
that I know in real life that I have on (2:26 - 2:30)
be reals (2:29 - 2:33)
um anybody knows anybody in real life (2:30 - 2:35)
and it's quite funny because they quite (2:33 - 2:36)
often meet up together so like they'll (2:35 - 2:38)
all just have almost identical bereals (2:36 - 2:40)
of just their faces (2:38 - 2:42)
well it just totally doesn't make you (2:40 - 2:46)
feel left out what is be real oh dear (2:42 - 2:48)
okay (2:46 - 2:48)
it is it is the answer to uh wow what's (2:50 - 2:57)
the best way to put a question that (2:56 - 2:59)
nobody's asked so you know how Instagram (2:57 - 3:02)
used to be like let me just take a (2:59 - 3:03)
picture of what's going on in my life (3:02 - 3:05)
and share it with my friends and then (3:03 - 3:08)
all after over time it became let me (3:05 - 3:10)
construct this image of a lifestyle that (3:08 - 3:12)
doesn't really exist in reality so be (3:10 - 3:14)
real is trying to counteract that and (3:12 - 3:18)
the way that be real does that is it (3:14 - 3:23)
just at a random point oh is that that (3:18 - 3:25)
weird thing you do everyone's where (3:23 - 3:27)
you're like oh it gives you an alert and (3:25 - 3:29)
you have to you have two minutes to take (3:27 - 3:31)
a picture of what you're doing in that (3:29 - 3:32)
moment (3:31 - 3:35)
Greg you've been featured on my be real (3:32 - 3:37)
what happens if you're (3:35 - 3:40)
if you're busy doing taxes well you just (3:37 - 3:41)
don't you just don't do it at that point (3:40 - 3:43)
well no no no like it does it doesn't (3:41 - 3:45)
automatically do it you think it's the (3:43 - 3:47)
type of service that you agreed upon you (3:45 - 3:49)
can you can post late but then it gives (3:47 - 3:52)
you a notice that says this was posted (3:49 - 3:54)
10 hours later because I there's once (3:52 - 3:56)
when the alert went off at like 11 58 (3:54 - 3:59)
p.m and you know 11 58 PM will answer is (3:56 - 4:01)
long gone from this you're gone you're (3:59 - 4:02)
dead (4:01 - 4:06)
so I just posted when I woke up (4:02 - 4:08)
all right so I'm very intrigued as to (4:06 - 4:10)
how they decide the timings because it's (4:08 - 4:11)
definitely not the same across the world (4:10 - 4:13)
because yeah that's quite often posting (4:11 - 4:16)
several hours apart and I wonder whether (4:13 - 4:17)
instead of because I don't think they're (4:16 - 4:19)
doing it times on by time zone either I (4:17 - 4:21)
think it's great (4:19 - 4:23)
that's what I'm suspecting so like I (4:21 - 4:26)
suspect like all of Europe and like all (4:23 - 4:28)
of the Americas and then maybe like half (4:26 - 4:30)
of Asia and then like just kind of these (4:28 - 4:33)
chunks I suspect well China has one time (4:30 - 4:35)
zone so that keeps that easy but uh yeah (4:33 - 4:37)
but it's not all of Asia (4:35 - 4:40)
might as well be uh but I mean I've (4:37 - 4:42)
noticed like you are my only European (4:40 - 4:46)
and you're offset but me Jude and Haley (4:42 - 4:49)
like we're always at the same time (4:46 - 4:51)
and you're in different time zones yeah (4:49 - 4:54)
I think Haley's in power behind I think (4:51 - 4:56)
Haley's in Mountain Time (4:54 - 4:58)
right okay that time because you're the (4:56 - 4:59)
only person to have that's outside of (4:58 - 5:02)
Scotland so there you go (4:59 - 5:05)
uh before we go any further yes sir I (5:02 - 5:07)
know everybody is curious how my dating (5:05 - 5:09)
life in Pokemon Masters is going oh this (5:07 - 5:11)
is yeah there's been (5:09 - 5:14)
okay well first of all I'm now I am now (5:11 - 5:16)
having to decide (5:14 - 5:19)
between the my two best loves which is (5:16 - 5:23)
Professor Sycamore or n (5:19 - 5:26)
they are both up there they both love (5:23 - 5:28)
talking to me we have a great time uh (5:26 - 5:31)
yesterday we both visited a weird alley (5:28 - 5:34)
and talked about other which okay okay (5:31 - 5:36)
Pokemon Masters what does other mean as (5:34 - 5:38)
a topic what does other mean well what (5:36 - 5:41)
is it any anything other than the other (5:38 - 5:42)
defined topics that have been given to (5:41 - 5:44)
you (5:42 - 5:48)
which is Pokemon places items (5:44 - 5:51)
and one more I think and uh it's bizarre (5:48 - 5:52)
anyways Lily (5:51 - 5:55)
Lily I know you're listening have you (5:52 - 5:57)
dumped her have you you're dead to me (5:55 - 6:00)
good three questions three questions and (5:57 - 6:01)
she's like okay well we're done look no (6:00 - 6:02)
we're not (6:01 - 6:04)
we are not done (6:02 - 6:07)
we aren't get back in this dark alley uh (6:04 - 6:10)
and have a conversation about nebby Greg (6:07 - 6:12)
she is an individual with her own (6:10 - 6:14)
identity and she can make choices about (6:12 - 6:16)
how she conducted (6:14 - 6:18)
um thank you I played uh sun and moon (6:16 - 6:20)
and I know that's an incorrect statement (6:18 - 6:23)
look don't you dare (6:20 - 6:24)
all right her mom isn't even round (6:23 - 6:26)
here's the issue (6:24 - 6:28)
as I would frame it for you as an (6:26 - 6:30)
external viewer (6:28 - 6:33)
I would say Professor Sycamore presents (6:30 - 6:35)
as a very (6:33 - 6:38)
masculine presentation (6:35 - 6:41)
and I suspect n is more non-binary yeah (6:38 - 6:46)
and Greg I just think I don't see you (6:41 - 6:50)
having enjoying a life commitment to a (6:46 - 6:52)
non-binary partner I think you really (6:50 - 6:55)
thrive on the masculine energy so (6:52 - 6:58)
look when they stop forking out the (6:55 - 7:00)
gifts then the relationship's done (6:58 - 7:04)
money I'm just here for the money look (7:00 - 7:06)
also also (7:04 - 7:08)
apparently everybody in the Pokemon (7:06 - 7:10)
world is introverted because their (7:08 - 7:12)
energy goes down the more you talk to (7:10 - 7:14)
them yeah me too and like somebody has (7:12 - 7:17)
to start at zero and be like keep (7:14 - 7:19)
talking to me and I can be like we're (7:17 - 7:22)
done I've been here for five hours (7:19 - 7:22)
also it's still absolutely hilarious to (7:23 - 7:30)
have Giovanni cheering for all these (7:26 - 7:33)
people in the wastelands of a volcano it (7:30 - 7:35)
is still my favorite moments in his (7:33 - 7:38)
little Nidoking hat screaming at (7:35 - 7:40)
everybody to find treasure (7:38 - 7:43)
it's a perfect game now all right in (7:40 - 7:46)

Toya game is an Elite Trainer Box really (11:16 - 11:22)
a game our game's toys uh (11:19 - 11:24)
I mean I think games can be toys but can (11:22 - 11:28)
but is the trading card game (11:24 - 11:28)
walk to the category (11:35 - 11:41)
Fair yeah Fair fine okay (11:37 - 11:43)
the question is how much did (11:41 - 11:47)
the Pokemon company pay the judges (11:43 - 11:50)

want (14:37 - 14:39)
so in the game category we have like (14:40 - 14:47)
board games which I'm assuming (14:43 - 14:48)
they would fit (14:47 - 14:51)
because it's it's got like it's got Star (14:48 - 14:53)

welcome to the world of Pokemon (17:40 - 17:47)
um I imagine that this one game of the (17:44 - 17:48)
year (17:47 - 17:51)
specifically because of the crossover (17:48 - 17:54)
with Pokemon go and they're like how (17:51 - 17:56)
Innovative is it that they were able to (17:54 - 17:58)
breathe new life into the Pokemon (17:56 - 18:01)
Trading Card Game by doing a crossover (17:58 - 18:04)
Greg don't give me that look (18:01 - 18:08)

Lake Nokomis here in Minneapolis (31:17 - 31:22)
because there's nothing else (31:19 - 31:24)
I can (31:22 - 31:26)
it's interesting that they I don't know (31:24 - 31:27)
if those are the same as the events (31:26 - 31:29)
they've done in previous ones either (31:27 - 31:30)
because the naming is different from it (31:29 - 31:33)
yeah and they're different locations so (31:30 - 31:35)
there there isn't one in Edinburgh which (31:33 - 31:37)
there were there were ones in Edinburgh (31:35 - 31:39)
for like four in a row (31:37 - 31:41)
um so I don't know whether they're kind (31:39 - 31:44)
of not doing them over over kind of the (31:41 - 31:46)
northern hemisphere autumn and winter (31:44 - 31:51)
period or I feel like this is their push (31:46 - 31:53)
towards their like hey we finally find a (31:51 - 31:55)
community Ambassador remember how they (31:53 - 31:57)
had people sign up for that (31:55 - 32:01)
um so I think this is the Minneapolis (31:57 - 32:03)
one reporting tonight at Niantic (32:01 - 32:05)
probably in the Silph Road saying we're (32:03 - 32:08)
doing a meet-up in Nokomis (32:05 - 32:11)
and whoever that is is not listed it's (32:08 - 32:12)
just hey go there (32:11 - 32:15)
and you'll find somebody (32:12 - 32:17)
so do you think that's the impermanently (32:15 - 32:20)
replaced their official Niantic things (32:17 - 32:22)
with these Ambassador things or do you (32:20 - 32:23)
think that's just yeah I just think the (32:22 - 32:26)
summer of them doing go Fest is over and (32:23 - 32:28)
then they'll switch to the summer of (32:26 - 32:29)
doing go Fest stuff in the southern (32:28 - 32:33)
hemisphere because it's nice (32:29 - 32:34)
I don't think they've they've not got (32:33 - 32:35)
any of them in the southern hemisphere (32:34 - 32:37)
though (32:35 - 32:39)
they've just they've still just got the (32:37 - 32:42)
the tunes (32:39 - 32:42)
won't be summer until December they (32:42 - 32:46)
didn't just do it in the summer here (32:44 - 32:47)
they did it in Spring as well (32:46 - 32:50)
this fall but it's only been spring for (32:47 - 32:52)
three days (32:50 - 32:54)
this will be the first they did it they (32:52 - 32:57)
did it in March it's barely spring Hmm (32:54 - 33:01)
Yeah March is barely spring (32:57 - 33:01)
but I I think they don't like we already (33:01 - 33:07)
know they don't like South America this (33:05 - 33:11)
is this is a standard known issue (33:07 - 33:11)
there are two parks in the entirety of (33:12 - 33:17)
Africa on that map (33:15 - 33:20)
and they're both in South Africa there's (33:17 - 33:22)
like there's a lot I could say about the (33:20 - 33:25)
representation of Africa and the digital (33:22 - 33:27)
world but I'm not getting paid for it so (33:25 - 33:28)
I won't (33:27 - 33:31)
if you need will Anderson's expert (33:28 - 33:33)
advice and also (33:31 - 33:35)
sadly I was contacted by the African (33:33 - 33:36)
studies program at Georgetown this past (33:35 - 33:38)
week and they said please send us a face (33:36 - 33:39)
picture and the work that you've done (33:38 - 33:42)
for Africa over the past 25 years since (33:39 - 33:44)
you got your African study certificate (33:42 - 33:46)
from Georgetown and I said I must (33:44 - 33:49)
politely decline (33:46 - 33:49)
uh are we gonna read uh Steve's little (33:53 - 33:58)
opinion piece about South Korea not yet (33:56 - 34:00)
not yet we'll get there (33:58 - 34:02)
um what are the community Parks I think (34:00 - 34:05)
that's this park may be a fun place to (34:02 - 34:06)
play with your local community while (34:05 - 34:08)
enjoying some fresh air so basically (34:06 - 34:11)
what they've done if you are somebody (34:08 - 34:13)
who plays Pokemon go alone if you go to (34:11 - 34:16)
the Pokemon go live website look at the (34:13 - 34:18)
Litwick Community Day and then click on (34:16 - 34:21)
the link for uh what was the name of the (34:18 - 34:23)
link it was like down it's down towards (34:21 - 34:24)
the bottom of the article but they've (34:23 - 34:26)
little yeah they put pointers on the (34:24 - 34:28)
community today map Community Day map (34:26 - 34:31)
where they have seen multiple people all (34:28 - 34:33)
playing together so they know that (34:31 - 34:35)
that's a hot spot (34:33 - 34:39)
for people to play Pokemon go what is (34:35 - 34:42)
uniquely interesting (34:39 - 34:45)
Greg can you catch it (34:42 - 34:46)
do you have do you have an idea I see (34:48 - 34:52)
Silverwood Park where you and I yeah (34:49 - 34:54)
definitely go yeah we go there is is (34:52 - 34:56)
ticked (34:54 - 34:58)
but there is a place that is not ticked (34:56 - 35:00)
yeah I mean (34:58 - 35:06)
America is not a part that's true (35:00 - 35:06)
so it does say well enjoying fresh air (35:06 - 35:10)
is there fresh air in the Mall of (35:09 - 35:12)
America yeah there's actually no HVAC (35:10 - 35:14)
system at all yeah there's no HVAC (35:12 - 35:17)
system so yeah really wow there's no (35:14 - 35:18)
HVAC system in the Mall of America (35:17 - 35:22)
there's no air conditioning there's no (35:18 - 35:25)
hearing nothing wow there's a there's a (35:22 - 35:28)
very actually a very interesting if (35:25 - 35:30)
you're interested in how they did the (35:28 - 35:32)
airflow in Mall of America it is (35:30 - 35:33)
actually quite interesting if you're (35:32 - 35:35)
into that thing just look it up there's (35:33 - 35:36)
been a lot they did a lot of studies (35:35 - 35:41)
about it but it really is the heat is in (35:36 - 35:43)
the winter is generated by the people in (35:41 - 35:44)
there (35:43 - 35:48)
and they have an entire system of (35:44 - 35:49)
circulating the air underground to cool (35:48 - 35:51)
it off in the summer (35:49 - 35:53)
um it's really it's it's it's a (35:51 - 35:55)
fascinating thing they did it they made (35:53 - 35:56)
it surprisingly for when it was built (35:55 - 35:59)
pretty green at the time (35:56 - 36:01)
um but yeah there's no there's not a lot (35:59 - 36:04)
of fresh air in that mall (36:01 - 36:04)
I am interested in how like what their (36:04 - 36:09)
threshold is for defining these Parks (36:07 - 36:11)
because looking at in Scotland there's (36:09 - 36:13)
quite a few that make perfect sense to (36:11 - 36:15)
me and then there's one random one in (36:13 - 36:16)
this little village in the west of (36:15 - 36:19)
Scotland that surely must have you know (36:16 - 36:20)
only maybe a thousand people living (36:19 - 36:23)
there and it's this random little thing (36:20 - 36:25)
oh one I don't know maybe all one (36:23 - 36:27)
thousand people there play Pokemon go (36:25 - 36:29)
they must do but it's the only one (36:27 - 36:31)
that's out in the sticks like everything (36:29 - 36:33)
else is in the the cities which makes (36:31 - 36:35)
make sense come on out let's be 100 (36:33 - 36:38)
honest here all of Scotland is the (36:35 - 36:39)
sticks (36:38 - 36:41)
so clearly someone has never been to (36:39 - 36:43)
Glasgow (36:41 - 36:45)
third biggest city in the UK I mean (36:43 - 36:48)
congratulations the UK as long as you (36:45 - 36:51)
put the asterisk in the UK exactly (36:48 - 36:54)
I didn't realize that (36:51 - 36:57)
Trout Brook nature Sanctuary was a hot (36:54 - 37:00)
spot for (36:57 - 37:00)
for go I (37:01 - 37:05)
I didn't think they had great coverage (37:03 - 37:06)
well I mean (37:05 - 37:09)
it's a beautiful Park it's about as good (37:06 - 37:13)
as that small town in Western Scotland I (37:09 - 37:14)
guess (37:13 - 37:16)
all right Greg do you want to read (37:14 - 37:19)
Steve's travel report from Pokemon go (37:16 - 37:23)
Safari Zone yes of course I shall yeah (37:19 - 37:23)
South Korea where it is it's in a park (37:25 - 37:33)
yeah uh this is gaijal Park hold on yeah (37:29 - 37:36)
that sounds about right anyways (37:33 - 37:39)
uh my opinion which is Steve's opinion (37:36 - 37:43)
on Safari Zone Korea uh he says it's (37:39 - 37:44)
very similar to St Louis there was no (37:43 - 37:47)
merch Booth like St Louis they did have (37:44 - 37:49)
a dedicated trade area like go Fest you (37:47 - 37:51)
could do five trades it was reduced (37:49 - 37:52)
start (37:51 - 37:55)
they had a reduced our Stardust uh (37:52 - 37:57)
There's a pikachu meet and greet which (37:55 - 38:00)
does sound fun uh but also that was (37:57 - 38:01)
supposed to happen at St Louis or did (38:00 - 38:03)
happen it's hard to say what happened at (38:01 - 38:05)
St Louis because it got rained out but I (38:03 - 38:07)
think that was supposed to no see this (38:05 - 38:10)
he's confused or is he compared because (38:07 - 38:12)
there was something which was the Safari (38:10 - 38:15)
Zone because we got the Safari Pikachu (38:12 - 38:17)
at the merch booth there was a murder oh (38:15 - 38:19)
yeah there (38:17 - 38:22)
uh the research you got uh one (38:19 - 38:25)
guaranteed Chinese spritzy uh which was (38:22 - 38:28)
like the research we had in St Louis (38:25 - 38:31)
uh he feels that the park was amazing it (38:28 - 38:33)
was five kilometers to walk around the (38:31 - 38:36)
lake uh they did bring cows but they had (38:33 - 38:38)
only set them on one side of the parks (38:36 - 38:42)
which uh uh created some drop areas they (38:38 - 38:45)
needed on both sides of the park uh (38:42 - 38:49)
personally for Steve it was not worth (38:45 - 38:52)
the expensive flight and hotel (38:49 - 38:54)
uh it was way more expensive than go (38:52 - 38:57)
Fest Germany and go Fest Seattle which (38:54 - 39:00)
he felt were much better experiences (38:57 - 39:03)
uh it is definitely worth going if you (39:00 - 39:06)
are in South Korea or you're in nearby (39:03 - 39:09)
countries where the uh flights would be (39:06 - 39:11)
shorter and cheaper (39:09 - 39:12)
um (39:11 - 39:16)
overall like any trip you get in what (39:12 - 39:18)
you put in so if you decide to go visit (39:16 - 39:20)
and do other travel things in the city (39:18 - 39:23)
that you've never been in your mileage (39:20 - 39:25)
may vary about how much you value that (39:23 - 39:27)
trip (39:25 - 39:29)
I agree because like I would probably (39:27 - 39:31)
get little to nothing out of going to (39:29 - 39:34)
Germany but I'd be going wild if I was (39:31 - 39:35)
in South Korea I'd be having the (39:34 - 39:38)
greatest time of my life visiting every (39:35 - 39:40)
location from every K drama I've ever (39:38 - 39:43)
watched you know just to see those sites (39:40 - 39:45)
and be in those places get to take a (39:43 - 39:48)
stroll along the Han River please dreams (39:45 - 39:51)
can come true (39:48 - 39:51)
all right one more news article before (39:52 - 39:58)
the break (39:56 - 40:01)
if I can figure out where I put it (39:58 - 40:03)
this is a short one (40:01 - 40:06)
but there is a quiz at the end (40:03 - 40:06)
Pokemon the Arceus Chronicles available (40:07 - 40:14)
on Netflix Journey along with Ash and (40:10 - 40:16)
friends as they attempt to save the (40:14 - 40:20)
stunning Sinnoh region once more (40:16 - 40:22)
a visit to the cinema region turns into (40:20 - 40:24)
a high-stakes Adventure when Ash Pikachu (40:22 - 40:26)
and Friends joined forces with powerful (40:24 - 40:29)
Pokemon to confront a looming threat (40:26 - 40:31)
Pokemon the Arceus Chronicles now (40:29 - 40:33)
available on Netflix tells the story of (40:31 - 40:36)
Ash and his friends incredible Quest (40:33 - 40:39)
this new animated special originally (40:36 - 40:41)
debuted at the 2022 Pokemon world (40:39 - 40:44)
championships in London but fans all (40:41 - 40:46)
over the world can now watch the story (40:44 - 40:50)
inspired by Pokemon Legends Arceus (40:46 - 40:53)

Galactic commanders determined to find (40:53 - 40:58)

assistance from a trio of legendary (40:58 - 41:03)
Pokemon and Sinnoh Champion Cynthia but (41:00 - 41:07)
will it be enough to save the day (41:03 - 41:07)
here's the quiz have either of you (41:08 - 41:13)
watched this I have not watched it yet I (41:10 - 41:15)
just remembered that it was in there (41:13 - 41:17)
like oh I should watch that (41:15 - 41:20)
I have seen about five minutes uh when (41:17 - 41:22)
we were in when we were in London (41:20 - 41:24)
because we were I think they were (41:22 - 41:26)
playing at London right this is it is (41:24 - 41:28)
yeah yeah it's the exact same one yeah (41:26 - 41:30)
um we we decided not to go and watch it (41:28 - 41:32)
and we're walking around playing Pokemon (41:30 - 41:34)
go and forgot that it was the time so we (41:32 - 41:36)
just kind of walked past and noticed it (41:34 - 41:37)
and saw it for about five minutes as we (41:36 - 41:39)
were walking past so I haven't watched (41:37 - 41:43)
it I'm interested to find out if (41:39 - 41:46)
I believe (41:43 - 41:49)
there were three basically three movies (41:46 - 41:53)
in a series that were like the Arceus (41:49 - 41:56)
films and is this does this make it a (41:53 - 41:57)
fourth in that series or is it (41:56 - 42:00)
completely separate (41:57 - 42:00)
oh interesting right because it was hold (42:00 - 42:06)
on let me see (42:04 - 42:07)
uh (42:06 - 42:10)
Giratina and the Sky Warrior is one (42:07 - 42:13)
Arceus and the Jewel of Life is one I (42:10 - 42:16)
think those are related (42:13 - 42:19)
and possibly The Rise of Darkrai did (42:16 - 42:22)
that have Arceus in it hmm (42:19 - 42:24)
I think it did (42:22 - 42:28)
uh yeah so the Wikipedia page does say (42:24 - 42:30)
that the two that you've mentioned are (42:28 - 42:32)
sequels to this one specifically oh they (42:30 - 42:35)
do relate okay oh interesting you need (42:32 - 42:37)
to be in the Deep Lord and know this one (42:35 - 42:40)
I was almost in the Deep lore but much (42:37 - 42:43)
like the theme of this week's episode I (42:40 - 42:45)
was just scraping (42:43 - 42:47)
scrape (42:45 - 42:50)
laughs (42:47 - 42:50)
all right we will yeah well (42:50 - 42:53)
interestingly they aren't they aren't (42:52 - 42:55)
saying this is uh a movie though they (42:53 - 42:57)
are saying it's a special (42:55 - 43:02)
uh I think because it's not in theaters (42:57 - 43:04)
like you can't buy a ticket to go to a (43:02 - 43:05)
theater to see it they're not going to (43:04 - 43:08)
give it that name yeah I'm just (43:05 - 43:10)
wondering why they did that because we (43:08 - 43:13)
haven't had one since (43:10 - 43:17)
2020 was the last film that came out uh (43:13 - 43:19)
although it didn't come out until last (43:17 - 43:21)
year right yeah yeah that's the most (43:19 - 43:26)
recent Yeah official film that we've had (43:21 - 43:26)
can't say hmm (43:27 - 43:32)
everybody everybody watch it everybody (43:29 - 43:34)
has to please give us their opinions (43:32 - 43:37)

I mean have have we seen a single (47:53 - 47:57)
Pokemon (47:56 - 48:00)
set like this (47:57 - 48:02)
man (48:00 - 48:03)
I think there was a there was an (48:02 - 48:05)
Evolutions one but obviously that was (48:03 - 48:08)
that was all of them rather than just (48:05 - 48:09)
one (48:08 - 48:11)
um but no I think the only other premium (48:09 - 48:13)
there's I think there's only been one (48:11 - 48:14)
other premium collection that was the (48:13 - 48:16)
celebrations one (48:14 - 48:17)
last year (48:16 - 48:19)
uh which was (48:17 - 48:21)
already impossible to get (48:19 - 48:23)
um and then you make a Charizard base (48:21 - 48:25)
and uh good luck with that that's yeah (48:23 - 48:28)
because I got every I got every other (48:25 - 48:30)
box of the (48:28 - 48:33)
um the celebration set last year and I (48:30 - 48:35)
just couldn't get the premium collection (48:33 - 48:38)
it just like tried everywhere for months (48:35 - 48:41)
did that also come with the metal Dice (48:38 - 48:44)
and the metal status markers and that (48:41 - 48:47)
all yeah yeah it did it did yeah it also (48:44 - 48:49)
had the uh the gold limited edition (48:47 - 48:53)
cards uh the Pokeball and (48:49 - 48:56)
a Pikachu I think (48:53 - 48:58)
oh I know I have them (48:56 - 49:00)
somewhere but I thought you didn't I (48:58 - 49:02)
ended up buying I didn't get the (49:00 - 49:04)
collection I ended up buying the things (49:02 - 49:07)
that were exclusive to it from eBay and (49:04 - 49:09)
probably spending more money than the (49:07 - 49:11)
collection itself would have cost that's (49:09 - 49:14)
how the scalpers get you yep my real (49:11 - 49:17)
question is the play mat is it like one (49:14 - 49:20)
of those nice play mats that you would (49:17 - 49:23)
actually use or is it a piece of paper (49:20 - 49:23)
I suspect it's one of the nice fabric (49:24 - 49:27)
ones (49:26 - 49:30)
but that is I don't think we have a (49:27 - 49:32)
picture of it yet oh okay because like (49:30 - 49:35)
if it's not one of the ones that well to (49:32 - 49:37)
me the way the the picture of the Box (49:35 - 49:40)
doesn't look like it can hold yeah like (49:37 - 49:44)
a cloth worm with a nice rubber back to (49:40 - 49:47)
a rubberized back to it I mean it could (49:44 - 49:49)
be rolled up it's it's hard to see how (49:47 - 49:52)
big this box is (49:49 - 49:54)
true true (49:52 - 49:55)
foreign (49:54 - 49:59)
it would be (49:55 - 49:59)
something (50:00 - 50:04)
if it's a full-size play mat rolled up (50:01 - 50:05)
and shoved in that box (50:04 - 50:08)
I have a feeling it's a it may be a (50:05 - 50:09)
cloth rubberized playback but it (50:08 - 50:12)
probably will be small (50:09 - 50:12)
yeah there's I mean there's different (50:13 - 50:17)
sizes of play mats I really do like the (50:15 - 50:20)
art on Charizard V and Charizard V Star (50:17 - 50:23)
the Charizard D Max is a little too (50:20 - 50:25)
Godzilla for me (50:23 - 50:28)
I was wrong there was another premium (50:25 - 50:29)
collection there was azashian and (50:28 - 50:33)
zamasenta premium collection (50:29 - 50:34)
early on (50:33 - 50:36)
which you feel like you should just be (50:34 - 50:38)
able to find out what the playmat was in (50:36 - 50:40)
that one and it shouldn't be the same I (50:38 - 50:41)
know (50:40 - 50:44)
because the Box looks very similar (50:41 - 50:45)
just obviously different design yeah (50:44 - 50:46)
well (50:45 - 50:48)
somebody's gonna have to do the research (50:46 - 50:51)
we'll we'll find out in the comments (50:48 - 50:53)
from somebody who actually managed to (50:51 - 50:57)
get one of these collections (50:53 - 50:57)
uh I mean it doesn't do anything for me (50:57 - 51:03)
I I know that there are people who like (51:00 - 51:06)
super Stan particular Pokemon especially (51:03 - 51:08)
like TCG players (51:06 - 51:11)
and will like absolutely have to have (51:08 - 51:13)
the Charizard set so that they can play (51:11 - 51:15)
with it (51:13 - 51:15)

cleverly included Pokeball detail as a (52:33 - 52:38)

either Pokemon Scarlet it or Pokemon (52:43 - 52:46)

on as soon as it was live (54:01 - 54:05)
congratulations (54:02 - 54:05)
the minute it went live it was thinking (54:10 - 54:16)
about okay I have a bone to pick with (54:13 - 54:18)
this stupid article because it says (54:16 - 54:20)
pre-order is available and then if you (54:18 - 54:21)
read his description it's like well not (54:20 - 54:22)
here though (54:21 - 54:25)
but not here either not here actually (54:22 - 54:27)
it's not anywhere but here's the links (54:25 - 54:30)
so just keep and maybe we'll update you (54:27 - 54:32)
and it says we will list where (54:30 - 54:36)
pre-orders could exist could exist (54:32 - 54:36)
it's just a pack of life this article's (54:36 - 54:40)
a pack of Lies (54:39 - 54:43)
James the writer of this article I'm (54:40 - 54:44)
coming for you (54:43 - 54:48)
for selling me a pack of Lies (54:44 - 54:51)
but Greg you really want this one I (54:48 - 54:53)
actually do kind of really want this one (54:51 - 54:55)
um one because I don't have this model (54:53 - 54:58)
of switch I like having the artwork (54:55 - 55:00)
because right now I have the Eevee (54:58 - 55:02)
Pikachu one and it's time for a change (55:00 - 55:03)
out (55:02 - 55:06)
I actually can't afford this one so I (55:03 - 55:08)
can just go buy it the biggest is like I (55:06 - 55:11)
live really close to a Target so I will (55:08 - 55:13)
probably just end up going when this was (55:11 - 55:15)
an island to two Targets and I (55:13 - 55:18)
especially the one that's like the we (55:15 - 55:22)
have stuff in stock fancy Target yeah (55:18 - 55:22)
so we'll see um I mean I check everyone (55:24 - 55:29)
so I'll see if things are (55:27 - 55:31)
available for you again I get it's one (55:29 - 55:32)
of those frustrating things where it's (55:31 - 55:35)
like (55:32 - 55:40)
the prayer is selling out like you could (55:35 - 55:40)
have pre-orders like we know like (55:40 - 55:46)
you're gonna end up making a bunch yeah (55:44 - 55:49)
I just wish (55:46 - 55:53)
they I wish they would do builds (55:49 - 55:56)
to like order to build I don't know yeah (55:53 - 55:58)
way to phrase it right they know how (55:56 - 56:01)
many people will pre-order and then they (55:58 - 56:03)
could build that many versus having a (56:01 - 56:06)
limited Supply and then (56:03 - 56:08)
and then eventually somebody who wanted (56:06 - 56:11)
one is just gonna end up not getting it (56:08 - 56:12)
yeah I mean the funny thing about these (56:11 - 56:15)
is it's it's not really I mean I say (56:12 - 56:16)
they're not special like I'm not already (56:15 - 56:19)
buying one but like it's not really like (56:16 - 56:21)
they're special it's just like a yeah (56:19 - 56:24)
essentially paid on a Case yeah (56:21 - 56:27)
right existing switches where they have (56:24 - 56:30)
painted stuff on it and granted I like (56:27 - 56:31)
the colors which is why I want to buy it (56:30 - 56:34)
but yeah it is it is a bit wild that (56:31 - 56:37)
they're like well (56:34 - 56:40)
it's so that can't pre-order it is high (56:37 - 56:41)
demand because we had like four (56:40 - 56:46)
pre-orders false scatter scarcity yeah (56:41 - 56:48)
yeah because we've seen this before we (56:46 - 56:50)
saw it with the Animal Crossing one and (56:48 - 56:51)
now like literally they're like please (56:50 - 56:54)
please take this Animal Crossing switch (56:51 - 56:57)
we have 5 000 of them oh I need to buy (56:54 - 56:58)
one of those (56:57 - 57:02)
um I do believe I can count at least 10 (56:58 - 57:06)
consoles behind owl right now and that's (57:02 - 57:08)
just the ones that his head are is not (57:06 - 57:09)
blocking (57:08 - 57:13)
uh right we don't need more (57:09 - 57:16)
well look I currently do not have a (57:13 - 57:17)
switch or legs (57:16 - 57:19)
that might be because I just sold one to (57:17 - 57:22)
get the money to pay for this one (57:19 - 57:26)
wow I am I'm not increasing the number (57:22 - 57:28)
of switches that I have uh so I will (57:26 - 57:32)
have five switches once this one comes (57:28 - 57:36)
which sounds ridiculous until (57:32 - 57:37)
you realize that four of them are (57:36 - 57:39)
limited edition different Limited (57:37 - 57:42)
Edition Pokemon cards so there is a good (57:39 - 57:44)
reason for each of them (57:42 - 57:46)
but there's a good reason for any of (57:44 - 57:48)
them because you're an adult (57:46 - 57:51)
I mean yeah it's your your money (57:48 - 57:53)
satellites you will although you do have (57:51 - 57:56)
a wife and children to (57:53 - 57:58)
yeah this isn't best absolutely these (57:56 - 58:00)
will increase in value to put all (57:58 - 58:02)
children through University because you (58:00 - 58:04)
don't do college Al does your wife play (58:02 - 58:06)
Pokemon (58:04 - 58:07)
no she plays other games but not Pokemon (58:06 - 58:10)
does she play farming games (58:07 - 58:13)
uh she I'm trying to convince her to get (58:10 - 58:16)
into to try some out and she hasn't got (58:13 - 58:18)
there she's currently playing uh (58:16 - 58:20)
trombone champ I don't know if anyone (58:18 - 58:22)
else (58:20 - 58:22)
and uh she's been doing a lot of uh (58:24 - 58:29)
playing the Lego games (58:27 - 58:30)
um she plays a lot of them (58:29 - 58:33)
hmm (58:30 - 58:33)
rarely (58:34 - 58:39)
take my switch out of the dock I like 99 (58:36 - 58:42)
of the time and playing my switch on my (58:39 - 58:45)
very large television (58:42 - 58:47)
is there any argument for me to get an (58:45 - 58:50)
OLED switch (58:47 - 58:52)
Pokemon uh no (58:50 - 58:56)
I rarely take mine out either and I'm (58:52 - 58:58)
getting it because I want to look at I (58:56 - 59:00)
want to look at my hot legendary staring (58:58 - 59:02)
at me while I play my games (59:00 - 59:04)
I'm actually the opposite I'm I almost (59:02 - 59:06)
never play it on the TV (59:04 - 59:08)
um because we're quite often you know (59:06 - 59:09)
watching something on TV together and (59:08 - 59:12)
I'm playing on handheld I mean you share (59:09 - 59:13)
what happens with the other people while (59:12 - 59:16)
I uphold that content yeah but so does (59:13 - 59:19)
Greg yeah but (59:16 - 59:21)
you don't want to know you don't want to (59:19 - 59:24)
know the Wild Media Extravaganza that (59:21 - 59:27)
happens on my husband's desk but also (59:24 - 59:30)
like Greg and his husband have have are (59:27 - 59:33)
living life the right way I fully (59:30 - 59:36)
endorse they each have a floor of the (59:33 - 59:39)
home to themselves (59:36 - 59:42)
and they interact when necessary and (59:39 - 59:45)
yeah otherwise (59:42 - 59:45)
sadly that sadly that doesn't work when (59:45 - 59:51)
you have kids yeah (59:48 - 59:54)
we've got they've got dogs (59:51 - 59:56)
we have two dogs and let's not get into (59:54 - 60:00)
that discussion the dogs (59:56 - 60:04)
look all I'm saying is why where you (60:00 - 60:05)
have to entertain your children with (60:04 - 60:09)
things on the TV because they are (60:05 - 60:10)
actually aware of programming (60:09 - 60:13)
I can just play video games and as long (60:10 - 60:14)
as something is playing and there's (60:13 - 60:16)
noise the dogs are like we're not going (60:14 - 60:20)
out anytime soon yeah (60:16 - 60:23)
Craig does enjoy me playing Fall Guys on (60:20 - 60:24)
the TV he does like to watch me playing (60:23 - 60:27)
playing fall guys so there is something (60:24 - 60:29)
there no not a fan of the more (60:27 - 60:32)
complicated or more Serene games but (60:29 - 60:35)
fall guys is just the right level of uh (60:32 - 60:40)
of bright and wild and yeah exactly with (60:35 - 60:41)
Craig being one of the most Scottish (60:40 - 60:43)

it difficult for me switch split pad fit (61:03 - 61:12)
what is it a switch split pad see if I (61:07 - 61:13)
can explain it by reading this article (61:12 - 61:15)
accessory maker hori has revealed it's (61:13 - 61:17)
can you imagine that with an Irish (61:15 - 61:20)
accent I'm sure there's like all kinds (61:17 - 61:22)
of extra syllables in there so it's like (61:20 - 61:25)
splay it splay it pay it (61:22 - 61:28)

because I never apologize accessory (61:31 - 61:36)
maker hori because you know I used to (61:34 - 61:38)
like have an Irish person living in my (61:36 - 61:40)
house and she pronounced the word beans (61:38 - 61:44)
with two syllables and how is that yeah (61:40 - 61:44)
accessory maker hori has revealed it's (61:46 - 61:50)

your hands on International stock from (62:35 - 62:41)

you think of these new Pokemon designs (63:21 - 63:25)
will you be picking up the switch split (63:23 - 63:27)
pad compact when it's released locally (63:25 - 63:30)
leave a comment below and to learn more (63:27 - 63:32)
see our previous post and there's a link (63:30 - 63:36)
to the previous post I am so confused (63:32 - 63:36)
they're like joy-cons but without most (63:38 - 63:43)
of the features (63:41 - 63:46)
they're designed for like they're more (63:43 - 63:48)
ergonomic so they're designed for you (63:46 - 63:50)
know longer gaming sessions because you (63:48 - 63:52)
joy-cons holding them are like you know (63:50 - 63:54)
it can be quite cramped sometimes (63:52 - 63:57)
so that's kind of the idea behind them (63:54 - 64:02)
um I I suspect presumably those designs (63:57 - 64:07)
will come here you've got to think yeah (64:02 - 64:09)
oh also it's like to to preface all of (64:07 - 64:11)
this hurry (64:09 - 64:14)
is like the number one license to make (64:11 - 64:17)
controllers for Nintendo products right (64:14 - 64:20)
yeah if you see a non-nintendo (64:17 - 64:22)
controller for a Nintendo console it's (64:20 - 64:25)
most likely from Horry (64:22 - 64:27)
the split pad I think is is the original (64:25 - 64:29)
and the pro were certainly very popular (64:27 - 64:30)
with people the interesting thing about (64:29 - 64:32)
these ones is I don't know what you (64:30 - 64:34)
think but they look less ergonomic than (64:32 - 64:36)
the previous ones (64:34 - 64:37)
um although (64:36 - 64:39)
I don't know whether they've you know (64:37 - 64:41)
managed to create a nice balance but (64:39 - 64:44)
I don't know and the intent with these (64:41 - 64:47)
as as Al said they they don't do (64:44 - 64:49)
everything that the joy cons do is (64:47 - 64:51)
basically you can connect them to the (64:49 - 64:54)
switch to play in handheld mode but you (64:51 - 64:56)
can't you can't do anything else you (64:54 - 65:00)
can't read amiibo you can't do where (64:56 - 65:02)
like where there's games where you put (65:00 - 65:03)
the switch into the dock and take the (65:02 - 65:05)
joy console off and use the joy-cons as (65:03 - 65:07)
controllers if they're not connected to (65:05 - 65:10)
the switch they're not going to work (65:07 - 65:11)
yeah (65:10 - 65:15)
but man saying (65:11 - 65:17)
right because they're like (65:15 - 65:19)
this whole thing about oh the Pokemon (65:17 - 65:22)
ones I think what they're basically (65:19 - 65:25)
saying is the Pokemon ones which are a (65:22 - 65:27)
really cute Pikachu mimic you one I (65:25 - 65:29)
actually really like that and a cute (65:27 - 65:31)
Gengar one (65:29 - 65:34)
aren't available here (65:31 - 65:35)
and just they've not announced it (65:34 - 65:39)
doesn't mean they will never be really (65:35 - 65:43)
ugly monochrome I I think it's offensive (65:39 - 65:45)
to call that even apricot that's an (65:43 - 65:48)
offense to apricots and the yeah gray (65:45 - 65:51)
yellow one the gray little ones (65:48 - 65:54)
the apricot red looks like (65:51 - 65:57)
looks more terracotta pot to me then it (65:54 - 65:59)
looks like they were planning on doing (65:57 - 66:05)
something that never glazed it yeah yeah (65:59 - 66:06)
I think the weirdest thing about that is (66:05 - 66:08)
the buttons are the same color and that (66:06 - 66:11)
just feels really wrong to me (66:08 - 66:14)
so monochrome yeah (66:11 - 66:19)
it's not pretty what I have I have been (66:14 - 66:20)
considering getting a split pad for a (66:19 - 66:21)
while (66:20 - 66:22)
um but never actually done it I think if (66:21 - 66:25)
they do launch the Gengar one here I (66:22 - 66:26)
will probably (66:25 - 66:31)
it looks really good yeah is really cute (66:26 - 66:34)
and I've been a bit spoiled recently by (66:31 - 66:36)
the ergonomics of the the steam deck (66:34 - 66:39)
since I got since I got it so the idea (66:36 - 66:41)
of having slightly better handheld (66:39 - 66:42)
switch would be nice (66:41 - 66:46)
oh man I kind of want a steam deck no (66:42 - 66:49)
no no don't do it don't do it I mean I (66:46 - 66:52)
want one too but no I can't I just can't (66:49 - 66:55)
I can't do I can't I can't do more (66:52 - 66:57)
things if I were to get much time if I (66:55 - 67:00)
were to get a steam deck the only (66:57 - 67:04)
outcome of that happening would me be me (67:00 - 67:08)
buying portal for like the sixth time (67:04 - 67:09)
yeah (67:08 - 67:12)
on Portal on Steam yet (67:09 - 67:15)
you don't have to buy it again I I don't (67:12 - 67:16)
think I do have it on Steam because I (67:15 - 67:18)
have it on every other console (67:16 - 67:21)
interesting buying Bioshock for the (67:18 - 67:24)
sixth time buying the Mist series for (67:21 - 67:27)
the sixth time I didn't know yeah I (67:24 - 67:29)
think the thing is that I I have so many (67:27 - 67:31)
of these games on Steam anyway and I (67:29 - 67:33)
just never played them because I really (67:31 - 67:35)
hate playing games on a PC but having (67:33 - 67:38)
them on the handheld is just really nice (67:35 - 67:39)
so there's I mean the biggest thing that (67:38 - 67:41)
I'm finding it for is actually being (67:39 - 67:42)
able to play these Early Access games (67:41 - 67:44)
you know two years before they come on (67:42 - 67:46)
switch (67:44 - 67:46)
all right so let me do the (67:47 - 67:54)
appropriation is that the (67:50 - 67:56)
no not appropriation that's not the (67:54 - 68:00)
right word oh Dag attribution the the (67:56 - 68:02)
right attributions although I never I (68:00 - 68:04)
never go to that channel so that's why (68:02 - 68:08)
all right so we got uh (68:04 - 68:11)
uh Chris is the one who told us about (68:08 - 68:15)
this switch split pad fit (68:11 - 68:16)
um (68:15 - 68:20)
and Spencer submitted something that we (68:16 - 68:21)
didn't do oh Spencer submitted the (68:20 - 68:23)
Litwick Community Day which obviously (68:21 - 68:27)
was just getting in first congrats uh (68:23 - 68:31)
and then finally we have an entry from (68:27 - 68:35)
our Irish correspondent tone (68:31 - 68:41)
uh this is from Serebii so you know it's (68:35 - 68:45)
100 authentic but not sourced (68:41 - 68:48)
it's there's there's a graphic (68:45 - 68:51)
I think the source was just at the edge (68:48 - 68:54)
Twitter okay you you could say that yeah (68:51 - 68:58)
I yeah yeah I agree with you (68:54 - 69:00)
points to people where you got this (68:58 - 69:02)
information from so that people can't (69:00 - 69:04)
constantly say Sarah we mix things up (69:02 - 69:06)
because you never attribute your sources (69:04 - 69:08)
you just put information out there but (69:06 - 69:10)
if you actually gave back up sources it (69:08 - 69:12)
would give less credit to people who say (69:10 - 69:14)
you make things up hmm (69:12 - 69:17)
um I would also like to say to (69:14 - 69:19)
I'm going to limit this to Japan because (69:17 - 69:21)
I think they're the worst offenders you (69:19 - 69:24)
can't just put an X between two things (69:21 - 69:26)
and imagine that that means something (69:24 - 69:28)
yeah (69:26 - 69:29)
all right (69:28 - 69:32)
I mean especially when there is a game (69:29 - 69:34)
called Pokemon X (69:32 - 69:38)
well true they do it all over like spy (69:34 - 69:42)
x5x family Hunter X that's an amazing (69:38 - 69:45)
anime but most people are turned off by (69:42 - 69:48)
the X yeah (69:45 - 69:49)
but anyways (69:48 - 69:53)
Pokemon X Ed Sheeran (69:49 - 69:54)
celestial (69:53 - 69:56)
it has been confirmed that the (69:54 - 69:59)
collaboration between Pokemon and Ed (69:56 - 70:01)
Sheeran will be a song called Celestial (69:59 - 70:04)
this song is due for release on (70:01 - 70:09)
September 29th 2022 on the usual music (70:04 - 70:12)
platforms Ed Sheeran previously had (70:09 - 70:15)
collaboration with Pokemon through a (70:12 - 70:17)
special concert in Pokemon go last year (70:15 - 70:20)
and who he released a message to all (70:17 - 70:22)
players at the Pokemon world (70:20 - 70:24)
championships did you see the Ed Sheeran (70:22 - 70:25)
message at the Pokemon world (70:24 - 70:27)
championships how (70:25 - 70:30)
I don't think so but there's so much (70:27 - 70:31)
happened that weekend the world (70:30 - 70:33)
championships (70:31 - 70:34)
because you certainly the whole time (70:33 - 70:36)
hanging around with Steve on the stream (70:34 - 70:38)
you know there wasn't anything else (70:36 - 70:39)
happening (70:38 - 70:41)
I can't I can't remember an Ed Sheeran (70:39 - 70:43)
thing (70:41 - 70:43)
anybody here a fan of Ed Sheeran (70:45 - 70:51)
so (70:48 - 70:53)
For Me Ed Sheeran and post Malone are (70:51 - 70:55)
the same problem where I know I've heard (70:53 - 70:58)
their songs but if you ask me what they (70:55 - 70:59)
are I'd be like uh (70:58 - 71:03)
they just floated float right back out (70:59 - 71:05)
yeah I don't hate I don't hate this (71:03 - 71:07)
music but yeah I'm not gonna (71:05 - 71:08)
specifically go and listen to them (71:07 - 71:10)
except I'll probably specifically go and (71:08 - 71:12)
listen to this one yeah like if you ask (71:10 - 71:15)
at least once if you ask me yes to do (71:12 - 71:18)
like either (71:15 - 71:18)
the post Malone Pokemon song or put that (71:19 - 71:24)
in quotes or the Katy Perry I can't (71:21 - 71:26)
remember either I'm like I don't know (71:24 - 71:28)
true she said it's like oh I like the (71:26 - 71:29)
Katy Perry one but every time you think (71:28 - 71:31)
of it think of the electric slide and (71:29 - 71:33)
not her song and when you think of the (71:31 - 71:34)
postal model song I'm actually thinking (71:33 - 71:38)
of Hootie and the Blowfish because (71:34 - 71:40)
I don't (71:38 - 71:42)
I did literally you did something else (71:40 - 71:45)
to it what you did could not tell you (71:42 - 71:47)
just (71:45 - 71:50)
what I find interesting is they seem to (71:47 - 71:51)
be going all in on music just now (71:50 - 71:53)
because they'd only recently announced (71:51 - 71:56)
Pokemon music collectors (71:53 - 71:58)
um which is their uh collaboration with (71:56 - 72:00)
Universal Music (71:58 - 72:01)
um they've only released one song from (72:00 - 72:03)
that but I think it's interesting that (72:01 - 72:04)
they've done that because then obviously (72:03 - 72:06)
last year they did the Pokemon 25 right (72:04 - 72:08)
and yet they haven't released the sword (72:06 - 72:10)
and shield soundtracks yet yeah still (72:08 - 72:13)
nothing still a giant blank hole in my (72:10 - 72:14)
collection (72:13 - 72:16)
yeah it's just interesting these are two (72:14 - 72:20)
separate music collaborations that are (72:16 - 72:21)
being announced within a couple of weeks (72:20 - 72:24)
of each other well maybe 2023 is the (72:21 - 72:27)
year of sound types (72:24 - 72:28)
um (72:27 - 72:31)
for me there's songs that are like never (72:28 - 72:33)
skip songs right that come on and it's (72:31 - 72:35)
like I have to listen to this song all (72:33 - 72:37)
the way through there's songs that come (72:35 - 72:38)
on the radio and I was like I'm not (72:37 - 72:40)
going to change the channel but like (72:38 - 72:42)
I'll enjoy and pass that's where Ed (72:40 - 72:44)
Sheeran Falls and then there's like the (72:42 - 72:45)
mountain goats where I will literally (72:44 - 72:48)
stop listening to a radio station for a (72:45 - 72:51)
month if they play a mountain goat song (72:48 - 72:53)
um so yeah it's like I'll listen to it (72:51 - 72:55)
it won't imprint on my brain but it's (72:53 - 72:56)
like I won't change the channel just (72:55 - 72:58)
because it comes on (72:56 - 73:01)
yeah (72:58 - 73:01)
all right well that's all of the news (73:01 - 73:06)
that we have for this week so Greg are (73:03 - 73:08)
we prepared for question of the week (73:06 - 73:10)
well I thought it was gonna be I thought (73:08 - 73:12)
it was gonna be Cody (73:10 - 73:15)
so get ready (73:12 - 73:15)
question of the week (73:17 - 73:21)
ha ha (73:20 - 73:25)
little screamo little Norwegian amazing (73:21 - 73:27)
metal (73:25 - 73:30)
very appropriate all right this question (73:27 - 73:33)
was uh from our slack our slack question (73:30 - 73:36)
of the week from Chris uh and I believe (73:33 - 73:38)
Chris also submitted did I give him (73:36 - 73:40)
credit for one of these articles (73:38 - 73:43)
yeah oh yeah he did the hori one yeah (73:40 - 73:46)
this is uh Chris from the south of the (73:43 - 73:50)
United States which character from a (73:46 - 73:52)
past region and game could you see (73:50 - 73:55)
making a cameo appearance in scarlet and (73:52 - 73:59)
violet so this is along the lines of (73:55 - 74:00)
that strange (73:59 - 74:01)
um (74:00 - 74:03)
what's his name from black and white too (74:01 - 74:05)
who showed up in (74:03 - 74:09)
sun and moon Taurus (74:05 - 74:09)
was just like walking down the street (74:09 - 74:14)
hey the Hawaiian Islands (74:11 - 74:17)
I'm not in jail (74:14 - 74:20)
I just built a ship that freezes cities (74:17 - 74:23)
it was for science you can't arrest (74:20 - 74:26)
scientists (74:23 - 74:26)
I mean if there's going to be someone it (74:26 - 74:31)
will presumably from be from Kalos right (74:28 - 74:34)
nah (74:31 - 74:34)
it's right next door (74:34 - 74:39)
it could be Gallard but kallus is right (74:36 - 74:40)
next door (74:39 - 74:42)
maybe you'll finally get to go to that (74:40 - 74:45)
train station I've already said that we (74:42 - 74:47)
have it's the train station's pointing (74:45 - 74:49)
in the wrong direction (74:47 - 74:50)
well it depends on how you're holding (74:49 - 74:53)
your map now isn't it (74:50 - 74:55)
yes everybody in Kalos stands on their (74:53 - 74:56)
heads (74:55 - 74:58)
um (74:56 - 75:00)
I would I would not hate seeing there's (74:58 - 75:03)
no proof that (75:00 - 75:06)
paldia is next to Kalos they they're no (75:03 - 75:08)
not shown that at all they have not (75:06 - 75:10)
shown that we are just assuming because (75:08 - 75:13)
they're similar shapes and sizes (75:10 - 75:15)
I don't think they've ever shown it (75:13 - 75:17)
other than (75:15 - 75:19)
um Canto and Johto all of them they've (75:17 - 75:21)
never shown any of them Cloud areas what (75:19 - 75:23)
they're really saying (75:21 - 75:25)
um (75:23 - 75:25)
so who do we got (75:26 - 75:32)
Greg you got anybody who's spicy enough (75:28 - 75:36)
I mean I feel like uh I feel like (75:32 - 75:39)
we could see a brace a Bryson and a (75:36 - 75:43)
Diantha coming to that coming to the (75:39 - 75:46)
South Beach area for a film shoot and he (75:43 - 75:48)
gets right into them filming having a (75:46 - 75:49)
good old time (75:48 - 75:53)
over there doing stuff making making (75:49 - 75:57)
acting happen (75:53 - 75:57)
is that what it's called yeah (75:57 - 76:01)
well I don't think you're right about it (76:01 - 76:06)
being pointing the wrong direction (76:03 - 76:08)
depends on which train station you're (76:06 - 76:10)
talking about the one in the one in (76:08 - 76:12)
kurui the one that you never you never (76:10 - 76:14)
use in the upper right hand corner (76:12 - 76:17)
yeah so it's it's going it's going uh (76:14 - 76:18)
points which would be the right (76:17 - 76:22)
direction no that Points East to Germany (76:18 - 76:24)
it doesn't Point East I'm looking at it (76:22 - 76:25)
right now it points yeah it's still (76:24 - 76:28)
wrong (76:25 - 76:28)
less for some reason when you're in that (76:30 - 76:35)
town the camera is flipped that that is (76:33 - 76:38)
definitely going west that town is on (76:35 - 76:40)
the northeast side of Kalos (76:38 - 76:43)
uh-huh and the train is going the other (76:40 - 76:46)
direction it's going west it's going to (76:43 - 76:48)
England it's going to Galler (76:46 - 76:50)
I mean it could be (76:48 - 76:52)
it's not (76:50 - 76:54)
it's not but it could be yeah it's great (76:52 - 76:56)
but it is going it's definitely going (76:54 - 76:59)
west looking at people from careless I (76:56 - 77:01)
had completely forgotten there was a (76:59 - 77:03)
dragon type Elite Four member who she (77:01 - 77:06)
was and what she looked like (77:03 - 77:06)
uh I mean the Elite Four from Kalos was (77:07 - 77:13)
very forgettable uh that train goes into (77:09 - 77:15)
the mountain there's a tunnel there (77:13 - 77:17)
you're not looking it certainly does (77:15 - 77:20)
that is not the end of the line that (77:17 - 77:22)
train goes It goes both it goes both (77:20 - 77:25)
directions then yes well (77:22 - 77:27)
so it could it could absolutely it could (77:25 - 77:30)
absolutely go is this such a careless (77:27 - 77:31)
map where are we looking I'm not saying (77:30 - 77:33)
it is but it could Cora way town (77:31 - 77:36)
c-o-u-r-i-w-a-y (77:33 - 77:36)
yeah the the the Western facing side (77:42 - 77:48)
goes to uh what's the big city (77:45 - 77:50)
not castelia (77:48 - 77:54)
uh what's the center city in Kalos why (77:50 - 77:59)
is my brain Frozen lumios yes (77:54 - 78:02)
anyways getting back to this question of (77:59 - 78:04)
the week the only correct answer is (78:02 - 78:09)
Skyla because this entire whole theme of (78:04 - 78:12)
paldia is like (78:09 - 78:15)
things that you ride motorcycles cars (78:12 - 78:17)
and she's the airplane (78:15 - 78:20)
person so she's gonna fly her airplane (78:17 - 78:23)
to learn more about the mechanic what (78:20 - 78:26)
about the Go goat farmer then (78:23 - 78:29)
was there a cocoa yeah the whole Gogoat (78:26 - 78:32)
Ranch Maybe (78:29 - 78:32)
I'm going to go with Clement (78:33 - 78:39)
yeah Clement shows up where he's not on (78:36 - 78:42)
it all the time would you stop (78:39 - 78:45)
clemont's dad (78:42 - 78:48)
look there's only one way I'm gonna meet (78:45 - 78:50)
Clement's dad (78:48 - 78:52)
this is a power of science that's (78:50 - 78:55)
through Clement okay (78:52 - 78:55)
oh gracious (78:57 - 79:02)
well we know we already know that (79:00 - 79:07)
Clement May uh designed the Rotom phone (79:02 - 79:10)
so you know we'll go the Bell Route and (79:07 - 79:12)
you will have to upgrade your Rotom (79:10 - 79:14)
phone and come on we'll meet you (79:12 - 79:17)
somewhere to do that that's my theory (79:14 - 79:19)
no it's gonna be Sophocles (79:17 - 79:24)
Sophocles why would it be selfishly it (79:19 - 79:25)
also inserts himself into the places (79:24 - 79:27)
where he doesn't or he's not wanted and (79:25 - 79:30)
Sophocles just became a gym leader so he (79:27 - 79:33)
doesn't have time to be traveling he (79:30 - 79:35)
also he also yeah he strikes me as (79:33 - 79:36)
someone who doesn't really want to (79:35 - 79:38)
travel either he feels like someone (79:36 - 79:40)
who's like happy at home (79:38 - 79:42)
just want to stay here (79:40 - 79:44)
you have not seen his budding friendship (79:42 - 79:46)
in Pokemon masters with a super villain (79:44 - 79:49)
then have you I think we all know that I (79:46 - 79:52)
think we all know I have not (79:49 - 79:52)
all right our YouTube question of the (79:52 - 79:58)
week and this is from although they (79:55 - 80:00)
tried to hide (79:58 - 80:01)
who they were (80:00 - 80:04)
also another known Magic the Gathering (80:01 - 80:06)
cheater Ryan (80:04 - 80:09)
uh hey all what is the best set of (80:06 - 80:13)
remakes in each of your opinions (80:09 - 80:16)
and I answered in the YouTube comments (80:13 - 80:18)
the Unova remakes because they just got (80:16 - 80:23)
everything absolutely right (80:18 - 80:23)
I actually have two answers for this (80:25 - 80:31)
okay I'm sorry no so (80:27 - 80:34)
I can't I can't decide and I don't want (80:31 - 80:36)
to be accused of being a gen Warner so (80:34 - 80:38)
let me explain My reasonings for both of (80:36 - 80:39)
them (80:38 - 80:41)
so I think that (80:39 - 80:43)
uh fire red and leaf green (80:41 - 80:46)
are the the most accurate to the (80:43 - 80:49)
original games in terms of remakes (80:46 - 80:51)
and so if you're looking for that I (80:49 - 80:53)
think that that does it best (80:51 - 80:56)
but I actually think that let's go (80:53 - 80:57)
Pikachu and Evie (80:56 - 81:01)
are the most interesting in terms of a (80:57 - 81:03)
remake so you have the ones that are (81:01 - 81:04)
like basically trying to be the exact (81:03 - 81:05)
same game (81:04 - 81:07)
and then you have the ones that are (81:05 - 81:09)
trying to be the game but in the modern (81:07 - 81:12)
generation like oras (81:09 - 81:14)
and then you have let's go which is like (81:12 - 81:16)
let's kind of do what we like from the (81:14 - 81:18)
old game but try and do some new stuff (81:16 - 81:20)
that you know isn't just doing the same (81:18 - 81:22)
as what we did in the previous game in (81:20 - 81:25)
this generation and I really like that (81:22 - 81:28)
so I'd probably go for let's go but if (81:25 - 81:29)
you're just looking for a modern version (81:28 - 81:31)
of an older game although I don't really (81:29 - 81:33)
think you can call fire red and leaf (81:31 - 81:35)
mean modern anymore but at the time sir (81:33 - 81:37)
they were at the time I think it did a (81:35 - 81:41)
very good job of being most accurate to (81:37 - 81:44)
the original games I think (81:41 - 81:44)
Greg do you have an opinion uh you know (81:44 - 81:48)
what mine is (81:47 - 81:51)
Omega Ruby Alpha Sapphire yeah I mean (81:48 - 81:53)
those were some fun games to play I just (81:51 - 81:56)
I mean it's here's the thing for a (81:53 - 81:58)
remake it did what I needed it to do for (81:56 - 82:01)
me right like it it Faithfully for the (81:58 - 82:05)
most part redid the region but put in a (82:01 - 82:08)
ton of improvements that admitted yeah (82:05 - 82:11)
we relied on backtracking a lot in these (82:08 - 82:13)
early games like stretch out (82:11 - 82:17)
the tide that you spent and grinding and (82:13 - 82:20)
we're gonna not do that and this one (82:17 - 82:21)
you're gonna be able to teleport all (82:20 - 82:23)
around and then you're gonna get a giant (82:21 - 82:25)
legendary that you can fly around so I (82:23 - 82:26)
like I think they did the flight really (82:25 - 82:28)
well I think they did secret bases (82:26 - 82:30)
really well I think they modernized it (82:28 - 82:32)
really well (82:30 - 82:34)
um my gripes are they didn't include us (82:32 - 82:36)
enough stuff from Emerald they didn't do (82:34 - 82:38)
the whole battle Factory stuff which had (82:36 - 82:40)
been really nice for an end game in that (82:38 - 82:42)
game because (82:40 - 82:44)
the battle Factory stuff needs to come (82:42 - 82:47)
back it's a really interesting it's a (82:44 - 82:48)
really interesting thing to do with your (82:47 - 82:52)
end game that's not just battle tree (82:48 - 82:53)
um (82:52 - 82:55)
and so I mean I have complaints about it (82:53 - 82:58)
but I think when I look at remakes I (82:55 - 83:01)
think they did enough things right I (82:58 - 83:02)
think the problem I have with heart gold (83:01 - 83:04)
soul silver which always makes people (83:02 - 83:07)
angry is like they improve the AI (83:04 - 83:11)
and added Sports (83:07 - 83:11)
they did change they made the Safari (83:14 - 83:18)
Zone super weird (83:16 - 83:22)
like it it is a it is a it's wild how (83:18 - 83:24)
they change the Safari Zone they didn't (83:22 - 83:27)
improve Kanto at all it's still as (83:24 - 83:29)
pointless as it was and they didn't fix (83:27 - 83:31)
a leveling curve (83:29 - 83:33)
hmm (83:31 - 83:35)
and they didn't you still have to (83:33 - 83:37)
backtrack a lot in that game there's not (83:35 - 83:39)
a lot of shortcuts there's still a very (83:37 - 83:42)
weird Traverse through that game through (83:39 - 83:46)
Forest obstacles (83:42 - 83:46)
I mean personally I sorry uh I was just (83:46 - 83:51)
gonna say I like the I just like the way (83:49 - 83:53)
the the play style that they introduced (83:51 - 83:55)
in the let's go games I I like playing (83:53 - 83:57)
with my Pokeball plus yeah (83:55 - 84:01)
um I will say for Omega roofie (83:57 - 84:04)
whoa hello (84:01 - 84:07)
Omega Ruby Alpha Sapphire (84:04 - 84:10)
of all Pokemon games (84:07 - 84:12)
there's one like if you say Omega Ruby (84:10 - 84:15)
Alpha Sapphire to me it always comes to (84:12 - 84:18)
mind that battle with uh who was the the (84:15 - 84:22)
kid who Wally Wally at the end it was (84:18 - 84:24)
just I just think it's such a (84:22 - 84:27)
like with the way it fits in with the (84:24 - 84:29)
story yeah the way that like I almost (84:27 - 84:31)
want to say like the cinematography (84:29 - 84:34)
around it the the placement I just (84:31 - 84:37)
always comes to mind it's just such a (84:34 - 84:40)
memorable moment that you you don't (84:37 - 84:43)
necessarily have in other Pokemon games (84:40 - 84:46)
so (84:43 - 84:49)
still not my favorite remake (84:46 - 84:51)
yeah I do personally enjoy all of the (84:49 - 84:54)
remakes yes even even brilliant Diamond (84:51 - 84:55)
shining Peril (84:54 - 84:57)
um I think they're all good in different (84:55 - 85:00)
ways not to say that I wouldn't like (84:57 - 85:02)
them all to be you know (85:00 - 85:04)
would I have improved brilliant Diamond (85:02 - 85:06)
shining Pearl yes yes I think that could (85:04 - 85:08)
have been better in many ways but I like (85:06 - 85:09)
what they did with it you know I think (85:08 - 85:13)
it's biggest issues were in not being (85:09 - 85:16)
well stable enough right the bugs were (85:13 - 85:17)
an issue (85:16 - 85:20)
um and not trying to do things a little (85:17 - 85:22)
bit differently like I felt it was a bit (85:20 - 85:24)
too cautious and didn't try and improve (85:22 - 85:26)
some of the problems with them you know (85:24 - 85:30)
do everything the same (85:26 - 85:30)
um and I think that certainly with Omega (85:30 - 85:36)
Ruby Alpha Sapphire I think the (85:32 - 85:38)
that was good in many ways and (85:36 - 85:39)
particularly The Soaring you know the (85:38 - 85:42)
soaring was possibly one of the best (85:39 - 85:45)
ways to travel in any Pokemon game ever (85:42 - 85:48)
and I really would like that to to come (85:45 - 85:50)
back it got pretty close in Legends with (85:48 - 85:51)
the flying (85:50 - 85:53)
um I think it's pretty good (85:51 - 85:54)
um (85:53 - 85:56)
but yeah I think I enjoyed them all (85:54 - 85:58)
heartgolden Soul Silver certainly has a (85:56 - 85:59)
special place in my heart because I was (85:58 - 86:01)
the first game I came back to after my (85:59 - 86:04)
period of not playing Pokemon games (86:01 - 86:07)
um so yeah no I I I really like them all (86:04 - 86:09)
legitimately non-sarcastically love them (86:07 - 86:12)
all I mean I like again when people are (86:09 - 86:14)
like I can't believe you didn't like (86:12 - 86:16)
brilliant Diamond shining Pearl like I (86:14 - 86:18)
enjoyed the game (86:16 - 86:19)
yeah (86:18 - 86:23)
like I I don't enjoy Gen 2 but I still (86:19 - 86:25)
will play it it comes out I play it and (86:23 - 86:27)
I enjoy it like I have legit like it is (86:25 - 86:30)
my least favorite but I will I will play (86:27 - 86:32)
brilliant Diamond shining Pearl before (86:30 - 86:34)
I'll ever touch a Madden game I'll tell (86:32 - 86:36)
you that much (86:34 - 86:39)
yeah yeah they all have their charm and (86:36 - 86:42)
their issues (86:39 - 86:45)
all right Pokemon of the week (86:42 - 86:49)
last week's Pokemon let me find my notes (86:45 - 86:50)
about there I think Al knows it because (86:49 - 86:52)
I I didn't write it down (86:50 - 86:54)
correctly in the slack (86:52 - 86:55)
um but I can't remember what it was (86:54 - 86:59)
though uh so it's well you'll get it (86:55 - 87:01)
when I say it uh let me just read the (86:59 - 87:05)
clue again it's uh I said Nick Burgess (87:01 - 87:08)
or Burgess inspired this week's riddle (87:05 - 87:11)
Bellsprout Weepinbell Victory Bell (87:08 - 87:14)
Blossom and Beldum went on a trip with (87:11 - 87:16)
standard acceleration who was left out (87:14 - 87:18)
if you think there are two possible (87:16 - 87:22)
answers you are incorrect (87:18 - 87:22)
yeah it is (87:28 - 87:31)
so the reasoning (87:32 - 87:38)
for those who this was too difficult for (87:35 - 87:39)
is (87:38 - 87:42)
clearly I read a bunch of Pokemon that (87:39 - 87:45)
have the word Bell in their names there (87:42 - 87:49)
are two other Bell Pokemon one being (87:45 - 87:53)
bronzong which is the oh (87:49 - 87:55)
it's more than Belle it's like the the (87:53 - 87:57)
bronze Bell Pokemon or something like (87:55 - 88:00)
that the other being Chingling which is (87:57 - 88:03)
just like the Bell Pokemon (88:00 - 88:06)
um so that's why uh I said standard (88:03 - 88:10)
acceleration because that's one G versus (88:06 - 88:11)
two G's which you would find in (88:10 - 88:15)
shingling his name either way (88:11 - 88:16)
uh (88:15 - 88:18)
uh yeah bronzag does not have any (88:16 - 88:20)
weakness in Pokemon Mystery Dungeon (88:18 - 88:22)
explorers of Time and explorers of (88:20 - 88:23)
darkness (88:22 - 88:25)
okay (88:23 - 88:28)
you're both Mr Billy being used (88:25 - 88:31)
simultaneously (88:28 - 88:32)
wow okay (88:31 - 88:34)
uh (88:32 - 88:37)
when bronze on blinks or falls asleep in (88:34 - 88:42)
Gen 5 its eyes turn white (88:37 - 88:42)
I didn't even know it had eyes at tidel (88:42 - 88:46)
yeah (88:44 - 88:49)
uh prior to Jen (88:46 - 88:51)
eight bronze line was the only Pokemon (88:49 - 88:53)
able to learn rain dance by level up (88:51 - 88:55)
that could not learn any moves or have (88:53 - 88:56)
any abilities that would benefit from (88:55 - 88:57)
rain (88:56 - 88:59)
this may be related to its Pokedex (88:57 - 89:01)
entries some of which mentioned (88:59 - 89:04)
bronzong's natural power to summon rain (89:01 - 89:06)
clouds (89:04 - 89:06)
uh it's shiny is okay I mean the thing (89:08 - 89:14)
is they made it green so it's like (89:11 - 89:18)
old rusted copper I don't like it but (89:14 - 89:20)
the shuffle is yeah because bronze does (89:18 - 89:23)
not oxidize that's or is it brass that (89:20 - 89:26)
doesn't oxidize one of them I thought it (89:23 - 89:28)
was brass that doesn't oxidize (89:26 - 89:35)
bronze is an alloy of copper and (89:28 - 89:38)
though forget it (89:35 - 89:38)
or is copper an alloy of bronze and iron (89:38 - 89:44)
hmm don't that my Metallurgy is as well (89:41 - 89:47)
bronze is an ally that contains copper (89:44 - 89:49)
which can oxidize when combined with (89:47 - 89:51)
moisture (89:49 - 89:54)
yes so can I all right this week's (89:51 - 89:55)
Pokemon (89:54 - 89:58)
made it easier because clearly last (89:55 - 90:01)
week's was too complicated this Pokemon (89:58 - 90:05)
which shares a type with wheezing and (90:01 - 90:08)
shares a type with Berserker was the (90:05 - 90:11)
first Pokemon introduced with this type (90:08 - 90:14)
combination that neither had a Mega (90:11 - 90:18)
Evolution nor was a mythical Pokemon (90:14 - 90:21)
it has recently become much easier to (90:18 - 90:26)
find thanks to tiles and air tags (90:21 - 90:26)
wow the look on Al's face (90:28 - 90:33)
I'm probably doing my thing when I'm (90:34 - 90:39)
overthinking one of the specific things (90:36 - 90:41)
you see probably and I need I need to go (90:39 - 90:43)
back to and usually that's the point in (90:41 - 90:45)
the episode where I get to stop talking (90:43 - 90:49)
