been on the show for a while is it (0:44 - 0:48)
mistakes McGee look if you don't hear (0:45 - 0:50)
the previous section I was commenting (0:48 - 0:53)
how time doesn't work and people were (0:50 - 0:54)
saying that I have been on the show for (0:53 - 0:58)
a long time are wrong because nothing (0:54 - 1:00)
since 2020 has counted as it's all been (0:58 - 1:02)
one year also three is a great number (1:00 - 1:05)
and I'm excited to be on 533 (1:02 - 1:08)
this feels like deja vu uh you should (1:05 - 1:11)
because we're doing it again that's true (1:08 - 1:13)
okay again will normally presses that (1:11 - 1:15)
record button he's not here you you have (1:13 - 1:17)
been running the zoom I would accept (1:15 - 1:19)
that if you've been running the zoom now (1:17 - 1:23)
for the last four episodes so you cannot (1:19 - 1:25)
say will normally does that when it's (1:23 - 1:30)
been a year of you doing this week bengu (1:25 - 1:32)
is here will is not here this is why the (1:30 - 1:35)
zoom button didn't get hit recorded (1:32 - 1:35)
camera (1:37 - 1:42)
I was opening my window to let pengu (1:39 - 1:43)
talk (1:42 - 1:45)
am I coming in through the window yeah (1:43 - 1:48)
you're coming here now (1:45 - 1:48)
you got to get the color balance right (1:50 - 1:54)
so that the color of brightness of your (1:52 - 1:58)
room matches his room now so yes (1:54 - 2:00)
gotta make sure that the colors on that (1:58 - 2:03)
hoodie really pop mm-hmm yeah you always (2:00 - 2:06)
got to make it pop uh pangu is here we (2:03 - 2:08)
discussed how this was more than three (2:06 - 2:12)
episodes you have been on yep yep (2:08 - 2:12)
so now that's going to not make it in we (2:14 - 2:19)
have to wait for the temtem section (2:17 - 2:23)
yes okay it's just tragic (2:19 - 2:25)
I I did say I wanted to take a pit stop (2:23 - 2:27)
and talk about temtem because it's (2:25 - 2:29)
officially out (2:27 - 2:31)
uh it actually officially came out like (2:29 - 2:34)
two weeks ago I think so we kind of (2:31 - 2:37)
missed the mark on that but there's (2:34 - 2:40)
always doesn't it Bob (2:37 - 2:41)
um (2:40 - 2:42)
and then there was uh there was a good (2:41 - 2:44)
transition about something being cute (2:42 - 2:45)
and then I brought up Wiglet and then I (2:44 - 2:47)
brought up an Ed Sheeran and that's (2:45 - 2:49)
today's episode (2:47 - 2:52)
so I guess we'll just start with the the (2:49 - 2:55)
Wiglet (2:52 - 2:55)
um (2:55 - 2:58)
this is off (2:56 - 3:01)
uh the Pokemon's press website here a (2:58 - 3:04)
Diglett that dwells in the sea not quite (3:01 - 3:07)
discover Wiglet a brand new Pokemon (3:04 - 3:10)
discovered in paldea I keep forgetting (3:07 - 3:12)
that (3:10 - 3:15)
it's called paldayodaya (3:12 - 3:17)
um (3:15 - 3:20)
the Poke this was on September 29th by (3:17 - 3:21)
the way the Pokemon company (3:20 - 3:23)
International has revealed details about (3:21 - 3:25)
a newly discovered Pokemon in the paudia (3:23 - 3:27)
region uh of Pokemon scarlet and Pokemon (3:25 - 3:31)
Violet Wiglet the garden eel Pokemon it (3:27 - 3:33)
may look like Diglett but it's a (3:31 - 3:35)
completely different species they're (3:33 - 3:38)
really like playing that part up for (3:35 - 3:40)
whatever reason there's probably a (3:38 - 3:43)
reason maybe not we you know you thought (3:40 - 3:44)
there was a reason for two basklin and (3:43 - 3:46)
they were like nope there's just not (3:44 - 3:48)
enough fish uh (3:46 - 3:50)
I have a feeling that they are trying to (3:48 - 3:52)
differentiate that it's not your it's (3:50 - 3:54)
not a regional variant (3:52 - 3:56)
it's a whole new (3:54 - 3:59)
world to live in it's a whole new place (3:56 - 4:00)
to be (3:59 - 4:02)
although to be fair if they're trying to (4:00 - 4:04)
really differentiate it from Diglett I (4:02 - 4:05)
feel like starting your press release (4:04 - 4:08)
with a Diglett that dwells yeah not the (4:05 - 4:11)
best way to do that hey gen one do you (4:08 - 4:12)
remember how you liked everything about (4:11 - 4:14)
gen 1 well how about this game where (4:12 - 4:18)
it's genuine but different (4:14 - 4:22)
uh Wiglet boasts an exceptional sense of (4:18 - 4:25)
smell Wiglet is able to pick up scents (4:22 - 4:28)
60 feet away it also I feel like that is (4:25 - 4:29)
exceptional (4:28 - 4:32)
depends on the scent have you I my house (4:29 - 4:34)
is more than 60 feet and if something (4:32 - 4:36)
has gone wrong in my living room and I'm (4:34 - 4:38)
upstairs I'm like wait a minute (4:36 - 4:40)
what's happening 60 feet isn't much 60 (4:38 - 4:44)
feet isn't even across my kitchen (4:40 - 4:46)
I'm just trying to think of what's going (4:44 - 4:48)
wrong in your living room that you can (4:46 - 4:50)
smell on the other side of your house oh (4:48 - 4:51)
look I have two dogs and my husband (4:50 - 4:53)
Burns incense okay this morning I (4:51 - 4:55)
thought my house was on fire because it (4:53 - 4:56)
didn't warn me that it was lighting (4:55 - 4:59)
incense downstairs (4:56 - 5:03)
wait your dog was lighting incense well (4:59 - 5:03)
we won't get into that that nightmare of (5:05 - 5:10)
what they do when there's flame around (5:08 - 5:13)
sorry to bring it up (5:10 - 5:16)
uh Wiglet pokes part of its body out of (5:13 - 5:20)
the sand uh to feed in the ocean it is (5:16 - 5:21)
still unclear what the rest of the body (5:20 - 5:24)
hides in the sand or how long it might (5:21 - 5:26)
be it is said that wiglet's resemblance (5:24 - 5:29)
to Diglett might be a mere coincidence (5:26 - 5:32)
as a result of the adaptation to its (5:29 - 5:34)
environment it is the guardian eel (5:32 - 5:38)
Pokemon it's a water type it is three (5:34 - 5:40)
foot eleven which makes no sense because (5:38 - 5:41)
they literally just said the sentence (5:40 - 5:42)
before they don't know how long wiggle (5:41 - 5:45)
it is it weighs four pounds it has the (5:42 - 5:49)
abilities gooey and rattled (5:45 - 5:50)
um (5:49 - 5:53)
none of these are new because yamper and (5:50 - 5:54)
Magikarp have rattled (5:53 - 5:57)
Gumi has gooey (5:54 - 5:58)
I believe (5:57 - 6:02)
uh that's that's that's it okay so to (5:58 - 6:05)
back it up beep beep beep back it up uh (6:02 - 6:07)
this was originally shown in like a fake (6:05 - 6:13)
Zoom call that was shown in Japan and (6:07 - 6:16)
then had English subtitles but was shown (6:13 - 6:19)
nowhere in English (6:16 - 6:21)
even though the fake Zoom call (6:19 - 6:24)
Incorporated (6:21 - 6:26)
um like a Chinese speaker a Japanese (6:24 - 6:29)
speaker an English speaker a Thai (6:26 - 6:32)
speaker I think and then a Spanish (6:29 - 6:33)
speaker (6:32 - 6:35)
and they all spoke their respective (6:33 - 6:37)
languages (6:35 - 6:39)
and they were very coherent English (6:37 - 6:42)
subtitles (6:39 - 6:42)
um and it was a fake Zoom call you like (6:42 - 6:47)
joined it as like a fake Zoom call and (6:45 - 6:49)
there was no way to pause it and there (6:47 - 6:52)
was no way to fix the audio to it like (6:49 - 6:54)
you couldn't like turn it up or down it (6:52 - 6:55)
was just like this is how loud it's (6:54 - 6:57)
gonna be the entire time (6:55 - 7:01)
uh it was like a cute way to present it (6:57 - 7:03)
I think it was like (7:01 - 7:05)
it was like five (7:03 - 7:09)
survey so it was set up like Jock's (7:05 - 7:10)
assistant (7:09 - 7:13)
was like going out and surveying Pokemon (7:10 - 7:15)
in the paldea region and they first show (7:13 - 7:17)
off like here's a Diglett and you're (7:15 - 7:20)
like okay which and then the the last (7:17 - 7:22)
one all the people are like oh it's a (7:20 - 7:24)
Diglett and it's not big it's a Wiglet (7:22 - 7:28)
so it was like cool still confused why (7:24 - 7:31)
they they didn't put this out in English (7:28 - 7:33)
in any way (7:31 - 7:34)
um (7:33 - 7:38)
but a fake Zoom call I fake Zoom call (7:34 - 7:40)
was better than a 24-hour video to show (7:38 - 7:43)
off Ponyta when they and they forgot to (7:40 - 7:44)
animate the Ponyta tail so that was a (7:43 - 7:47)
real big confusing thing (7:44 - 7:49)
um much better because I think the whole (7:47 - 7:51)
thing was maybe like (7:49 - 7:53)
six minutes I'm not gonna say it was (7:51 - 7:57)
better I'm just gonna say it was shorter (7:53 - 7:57)
laughs (7:58 - 8:02)
okay before we talk about (7:59 - 8:04)
why Wiglet is Wiglet (8:02 - 8:08)
pengu what do you think of Wiglet I (8:04 - 8:10)
can't stop thinking about what might be (8:08 - 8:12)
under the sand and the implication that (8:10 - 8:14)
there's like this whole side of Wiglet (8:12 - 8:16)
that we have no idea what what it looks (8:14 - 8:18)
like like there could be more tentacles (8:16 - 8:19)
down there he could be a big round boy (8:18 - 8:22)
underneath that little skinny head he (8:19 - 8:23)
could like extend right down to the core (8:22 - 8:26)
of the earth and we just don't know (8:23 - 8:26)
Greg what's your Wiglet opinion do not (8:27 - 8:31)
like (8:30 - 8:33)
I thought you don't like mechanical (8:31 - 8:34)
Pokemon (8:33 - 8:37)
I am allowed to not like a lot of things (8:34 - 8:39)
if it was mechanical it'd be even worse (8:37 - 8:41)
here's the thing I like I think the (8:39 - 8:43)
garden eels that it's based off of are (8:41 - 8:44)
cute (8:43 - 8:48)
and if it had just been a garden eel (8:44 - 8:51)
Pokemon and not Diglett based I wouldn't (8:48 - 8:54)
find it so creepy but I find it super (8:51 - 8:56)
creepy because they keep making it like (8:54 - 9:00)
weirdly elastic and it's just it's just (8:56 - 9:03)
weird I don't like it and I've already (9:00 - 9:05)
seen people put images on the internet (9:03 - 9:08)
about it that I really don't like so you (9:05 - 9:09)
can see there being like weird art (9:08 - 9:11)
coming from it but I think it's cute he (9:09 - 9:13)
has like his big little pink nose he's (9:11 - 9:16)
like all squishy and stuff you know okay (9:13 - 9:18)
yeah I kind of think he's cute too (9:16 - 9:21)
okay so then the bigger question is why (9:18 - 9:25)
is Wiglet a new Pokemon with its own Dex (9:21 - 9:27)
number its own name (9:25 - 9:30)
looks like Diglett they make it a big (9:27 - 9:33)
deal that it's like not Diglett but they (9:30 - 9:37)
can't help bringing up Diglett so why (9:33 - 9:40)
do we think that it's they decided to (9:37 - 9:42)
make this a new Pokemon and just not a (9:40 - 9:44)
regional variant (9:42 - 9:47)
I think that in 28 gens they're going to (9:44 - 9:49)
have a region that is just the Pokemon (9:47 - 9:51)
that are like other Pokemon but begin (9:49 - 9:53)
with a W so we will have Wiglet and (9:51 - 9:55)
we'll have woo bet and we'll have all of (9:53 - 9:56)
the W Pokemon that they'll create (9:55 - 9:58)
between now and then and if this is just (9:56 - 10:04)
a long a long game the Wombo game (9:58 - 10:04)
warazard (10:05 - 10:11)
gosh I can't wait for warzard (10:07 - 10:11)
okay so I thought I did research here (10:13 - 10:18)
I thought it was because they changed (10:16 - 10:21)
the category (10:18 - 10:21)
so like Raichu and alolan Raichu are (10:22 - 10:26)
still the same category they're still (10:25 - 10:29)
known as the mouse Pokemon and then Sans (10:26 - 10:31)
Sandshrew and alolan Sandshrew are still (10:29 - 10:34)
known as like the I don't know what is (10:31 - 10:35)
that the I think they're known as the (10:34 - 10:37)
mouse Pokemon too or maybe they're not (10:35 - 10:39)
yeah but a lot of things are known as (10:37 - 10:41)
mice Pokemon in this game (10:39 - 10:42)
um (10:41 - 10:45)
but I was proven wrong although they (10:42 - 10:47)
they do have different categories (10:45 - 10:49)
I think diglett's like the mole Pokemon (10:47 - 10:52)
and this is the garden eel they they (10:49 - 10:55)
have they change categories for Voltorb (10:52 - 10:57)
so Voltorb is like the ball Pokemon and (10:55 - 11:00)
then his suian Voltorb is like this the (10:57 - 11:02)
sphere Pokemon (11:00 - 11:04)
and then Growlithe is like the puppy (11:02 - 11:06)
Pokemon and then hisuian Growlithe is (11:04 - 11:09)
like the Scout Pokemon I think (11:06 - 11:12)
so I thought well like okay well (11:09 - 11:14)
obviously changing type doesn't matter (11:12 - 11:16)
because full pix is still Vulpix whether (11:14 - 11:18)
it's a Lovin or fire (11:16 - 11:22)
and I was like it must be category (11:18 - 11:24)
but that doesn't make any sense either (11:22 - 11:26)
so there's not a lot of Rhyme or Reason (11:24 - 11:28)
here (11:26 - 11:31)
besides the fact they wanted to make a (11:28 - 11:33)
Pokemon similar to Diglett but then it's (11:31 - 11:35)
like (11:33 - 11:38)
thing around it is it's not like that I (11:35 - 11:39)
I feel like this is like one of their (11:38 - 11:42)
tests like how far can we push a thing (11:39 - 11:44)
and this is how far can we copy and (11:42 - 11:46)
paste and call it something new and (11:44 - 11:49)
people are like okay so they can recycle (11:46 - 11:50)
designs (11:49 - 11:52)
also um how many other Pokemon have like (11:50 - 11:55)
more than one Regional variation because (11:52 - 11:56)
we already have a lowland Diglett so (11:55 - 11:58)
maybe they're like paldean Diglett is (11:56 - 12:00)
too many diglets but we need to do it so (11:58 - 12:02)
we have me out yeah we have a lot of (12:00 - 12:05)
meows (12:02 - 12:06)
um surprisingly we don't have more (12:05 - 12:09)
Vulpix yet but one day I'm sure we will (12:06 - 12:12)
Miata is the only one that has more than (12:09 - 12:14)
one (12:12 - 12:16)
maybe they just didn't think Diglett was (12:14 - 12:18)
as special as Meowth I mean I think it's (12:16 - 12:21)
as special as male that's true (12:18 - 12:21)
because Mia has gallerian and uh lowland (12:22 - 12:29)
but they also do the thing where like so (12:27 - 12:31)
yeah mask is a well (12:29 - 12:34)
is CMS a good example so you have yeah (12:31 - 12:35)
mask and then you have coffee griegas (12:34 - 12:37)
and then you have Galleria Mass which (12:35 - 12:39)
looks pretty different and then you have (12:37 - 12:41)
runriguez (12:39 - 12:43)
and then you have like a Pokemon like (12:41 - 12:45)
Cubone where it's like Cubone and then (12:43 - 12:46)
Marowak and then Cubone and alola (12:45 - 12:51)
Marowak but there is no alolan Cubone (12:46 - 12:54)
I guess I don't know if I mean we have (12:51 - 12:56)
gallerian corsola that changes into (12:54 - 12:58)
something completely different yeah (12:56 - 13:00)
cursella I don't know if I would be more (12:58 - 13:03)
upset or less upset if wiglet's just (13:00 - 13:04)
three Wiglet (13:03 - 13:06)
I will be more upset if it's three (13:04 - 13:08)
wigged because I already don't like one (13:06 - 13:11)
I really want to call a Pokemon wug Trio (13:08 - 13:13)
though (13:11 - 13:15)
it's wig treat but they can't do wig (13:13 - 13:18)
true because that is the unofficial name (13:15 - 13:20)
of its (13:18 - 13:23)
a lowland form when he gets all the hair (13:20 - 13:27)
okay it does have like a wig on yeah (13:23 - 13:29)
it's not wig tree it'll be it'll be wag (13:27 - 13:33)
Trio very different oh yes it look is (13:29 - 13:36)
that a wig Trio no it's a wug Trio (13:33 - 13:38)
all right maybe we'll get one Duo that's (13:36 - 13:39)
like it's cool thing (13:38 - 13:42)
it's two of them just two (13:39 - 13:45)
maybe as it evolves more of it comes out (13:42 - 13:47)
of the sand and you like gradually get (13:45 - 13:49)
to know what's underneath it gets two (13:47 - 13:51)
big arms and a couple of wings and it (13:49 - 13:54)
turns into Charizard so Charizard oh (13:51 - 13:56)
when I think of the garden eel I think (13:54 - 13:58)
of a couple things one I think of the (13:56 - 14:00)
things in stardew Valley that like (13:58 - 14:02)
appear in the ground and you dig up and (14:00 - 14:04)
then it ends up being a book I know (14:02 - 14:05)
those aren't Garden eels I like the (14:04 - 14:07)
little worms yeah but it does remind me (14:05 - 14:10)
of that you dig up a worm and it becomes (14:07 - 14:14)
a book yes yeah (14:10 - 14:14)
it could be a bunch of different items (14:14 - 14:19)
but it's usually like a book (14:16 - 14:22)
um I think of kazoo from Monster Hunter (14:19 - 14:25)
which is a giant white monster that you (14:22 - 14:28)
fight that like Japan really loves (14:25 - 14:30)
um (14:28 - 14:32)
which I could see Wiglet eventually (14:30 - 14:34)
being wait what's the other thing that (14:32 - 14:36)
was three things but also Monster Hunter (14:34 - 14:37)
has the same thing they have like little (14:36 - 14:38)
worms that appear in the ground that (14:37 - 14:40)
like they're like mini they're like the (14:38 - 14:42)
the (14:40 - 14:45)
NPC monsters like they just exist in the (14:42 - 14:46)
world (14:45 - 14:48)
um (14:46 - 14:48)
yeah I think okay I think I would be (14:48 - 14:52)
more disappointed if it's just like wug (14:50 - 14:55)
Trio yeah (14:52 - 14:55)
I want it to be something else like you (14:56 - 15:00)
are making you're clearly making it (14:59 - 15:04)
something else and (15:00 - 15:06)
I'm hoping the fact that they're making (15:04 - 15:08)
a big (15:06 - 15:11)
deal out of it looking like David being (15:08 - 15:13)
different means like there are story (15:11 - 15:16)
beats tied to these like as part of the (15:13 - 15:19)
legendary path to get food and whatever (15:16 - 15:22)
you have there's like a reason for it (15:19 - 15:23)
because there's not a real good reason (15:22 - 15:25)
why they're why they've made it a Wiglet (15:23 - 15:26)
in that (15:25 - 15:30)
palday and Diglett there the only other (15:26 - 15:31)
thing I could think of they show this (15:30 - 15:33)
and this is like the the interesting (15:31 - 15:35)
thing in the (15:33 - 15:39)
Zoom call that again is weird that they (15:35 - 15:41)
didn't have any sort like if they don't (15:39 - 15:43)
like when they originally show Wiglet (15:41 - 15:45)
they they did make a 45 second like (15:43 - 15:48)
Wiglet intro trailer on YouTube (15:45 - 15:50)
and it's nothing like the Zoom call but (15:48 - 15:52)
in the zoom the the fake Zoom call I (15:50 - 15:54)
should say and the fake Zoom call they (15:52 - 15:56)
they show like Sandile like burrowing (15:54 - 16:00)
underground and like they're like little (15:56 - 16:02)
Sand Sharks obviously (16:00 - 16:05)
and so it's like they they've worked (16:02 - 16:08)
slash fixed that animation so ideally (16:05 - 16:10)
when you're playing scarlet and violet (16:08 - 16:13)
these Sandile won't just be walking on (16:10 - 16:14)
top of the ground they should be (16:13 - 16:15)
Underground (16:14 - 16:18)
so there's like part of me that's like (16:15 - 16:20)
somebody at game freak was really proud (16:18 - 16:22)
they've they've like made a new (16:20 - 16:23)
animation in the last 10 years and (16:22 - 16:25)
they're like oh we gotta have more (16:23 - 16:27)
underground Pokemon to show off this new (16:25 - 16:29)
animation we did yeah (16:27 - 16:33)
we need another one feel like there (16:29 - 16:34)
could be a lot of underground Pokemon (16:33 - 16:36)
that don't have to be another Diglett (16:34 - 16:40)
though yeah yeah (16:36 - 16:42)
well the the developer spent so much (16:40 - 16:43)
time on the animation they couldn't (16:42 - 16:47)
think they didn't have time to (16:43 - 16:50)
cook up a new Pokemon so you know just (16:47 - 16:53)
change the color make them along (16:50 - 16:53)
um (16:55 - 16:57)
okay the other thing off uh the other (16:58 - 17:03)
thing (17:01 - 17:08)
I I don't know if this is uh (17:03 - 17:08)
a song and a video (17:10 - 17:17)
let's Ed Sheeran made a song (17:14 - 17:18)
he told us the Pokemon company because (17:17 - 17:19)
he probably didn't want to release it (17:18 - 17:21)
any other way and they're like yeah (17:19 - 17:22)
we'll buy it we'll put some Pokemon in (17:21 - 17:23)
your video (17:22 - 17:25)
because I watched it again did you asked (17:23 - 17:27)
me what this song sounds like couldn't (17:25 - 17:29)
tell you (17:27 - 17:31)
it says the stars have aligned as (17:29 - 17:34)
Pokemon Mega fan and international (17:31 - 17:36)
Superstar Ed Sheeran has collaborated (17:34 - 17:38)
with the Pokemon company group on a new (17:36 - 17:41)
song Celestial his special track will (17:38 - 17:43)
appear in the video game Scarlet Violet (17:41 - 17:47)
launching November 18th fans can listen (17:43 - 17:47)
here (17:47 - 17:51)
uh Celestial video was inspired by Ed's (17:47 - 17:53)
childhood fashion fascination with the (17:51 - 17:54)
franchise and features some of his (17:53 - 17:57)
favorite Pokemon Pikachu Squirtle (17:54 - 18:00)
Machamp Snorlax and more what a gen (17:57 - 18:02)
Warner it follows oh it's all gen one in (18:00 - 18:05)
that thing too it follows the typical (18:02 - 18:09)
day in Ed's life with a Pokemon twist (18:05 - 18:12)
uh it was directed by yuchi Kodama (18:09 - 18:16)
apparently they're award-winning (18:12 - 18:17)
um (18:16 - 18:21)
okay so here oh Ed Ed has a quote here I (18:17 - 18:22)
played Pokemon since I was in Primary (18:21 - 18:24)
School me and my brother used to have (18:22 - 18:26)
different versions of the games and we (18:24 - 18:27)
would trade together until we completed (18:26 - 18:30)
our Pokedex I loved the cards but the (18:27 - 18:32)
games is what I lost myself in I love (18:30 - 18:34)
the whole world they create it kept me (18:32 - 18:35)
distracted if there was negative stuff (18:34 - 18:37)
happening in my life in school I wanted (18:35 - 18:40)
to avoid if I was a (18:37 - 18:44)
it was a world I could Escape into uh (18:40 - 18:45)
and I've played it ever since even (18:44 - 18:48)
though I'm 31. Ed Sheeran's younger than (18:45 - 18:51)
me yes what am I doing in life I don't (18:48 - 18:54)
know I still own a Game Boy Color and (18:51 - 18:56)
play Pokemon yellow or silver on planes (18:54 - 18:58)
or trains when I'm on tour I don't know (18:56 - 19:00)
if I believe that Ed Sheeran because you (18:58 - 19:02)
wouldn't be able to see the screen at (19:00 - 19:05)
all on a plane or a train (19:02 - 19:07)
all right so here's the thing I bet you (19:05 - 19:10)
he has he's Rich enough to have a (19:07 - 19:11)
special Pokemon Nook that has right (19:10 - 19:13)
lighting for him to play (19:11 - 19:16)
it's such an honor to add a uh song into (19:13 - 19:18)
a Pokemon game and shoot a nostalgic (19:16 - 19:19)
video I hope you guys enjoyed the video (19:18 - 19:23)
it was a it was a blast (19:19 - 19:24)
um (19:23 - 19:26)
I know a couple things about Ed Sheeran (19:24 - 19:30)
I know one he made a BTS song and (19:26 - 19:32)
um most BTS fans hate that song because (19:30 - 19:37)
it's zero BTS and 100 Ed Sheeran uh (19:32 - 19:39)
which that was permission to dance I (19:37 - 19:42)
Believe number two is I've read one (19:39 - 19:43)
interview with him where he said he (19:42 - 19:44)
doesn't own a cell phone because he (19:43 - 19:46)
found it distracting these are the two (19:44 - 19:48)
things I know about Ed Sheeran uh he's a (19:46 - 19:50)
redhead (19:48 - 19:52)
okay (19:50 - 19:56)
do do people like Ed Sheeran people Love (19:52 - 19:58)
Ed Sheeran but (19:56 - 20:00)
people love pumpkin spice lattes too so (19:58 - 20:02)
like (20:00 - 20:05)
I'm feeling so cold out right now (20:02 - 20:08)
Love Ed Sheeran I I wouldn't say I love (20:05 - 20:10)
Ed Sheeran but I like have listened to (20:08 - 20:12)
Ed Sheeran and like know things about Ed (20:10 - 20:14)
Sheeran I feel like he's in kind of a (20:12 - 20:17)
similar Camp to like Taylor Swift where (20:14 - 20:18)
it's like people love them but then it's (20:17 - 20:22)
also like very cool to not love them you (20:18 - 20:24)
know and it's like I feel like sometimes (20:22 - 20:25)
not saying that it's the case in this (20:24 - 20:27)
scenario people are just like it's it's (20:25 - 20:29)
the cool thing to do to like not love (20:27 - 20:30)
them even if the thing that they do is (20:29 - 20:32)
good so (20:30 - 20:34)
um here's the thing much like Taylor (20:32 - 20:35)
Swift like (20:34 - 20:37)
I I put a bunch of stars in the same (20:35 - 20:39)
category like Taylor Swift Beyonce Ed (20:37 - 20:42)
Sheeran post Malone their music doesn't (20:39 - 20:43)
interest me I know they're good at what (20:42 - 20:46)
they do but literally in preparation for (20:43 - 20:49)
this recording I watched and listened to (20:46 - 20:53)
this video I walked upstairs and I could (20:49 - 20:56)
not tell you a single tune (20:53 - 20:59)
or remember the melody or because it (20:56 - 21:02)
just does not interest me in any way and (20:59 - 21:03)
it's not like (21:02 - 21:06)
it wasn't good it's a well you know he's (21:03 - 21:08)
a good singer it's a it's a well-crafted (21:06 - 21:12)
pop song but it it just in my brain and (21:08 - 21:15)
out just was like nope this is just PR (21:12 - 21:17)
candy and nothing is here the thing that (21:15 - 21:19)
I do remember is what annoys me most (21:17 - 21:21)
about these Pokemon songs is that it's (21:19 - 21:24)
just a song (21:21 - 21:26)
that doesn't really have anything to do (21:24 - 21:28)
with Pokemon except if you like if you (21:26 - 21:30)
listen to it you'd have no idea you'd (21:28 - 21:33)
have to watch the video to see how they (21:30 - 21:37)
added it which is fine but it annoys me (21:33 - 21:38)
that it's like (21:37 - 21:40)
here's Ed Sheeran's Pokemon song what's (21:38 - 21:43)
got no Pokemon in it like (21:40 - 21:47)
oh again there is a writer correct yes (21:43 - 21:49)
it's a writer I'm a producer singer (21:47 - 21:52)
unlike the Katy Perry song like Katy (21:49 - 21:54)
Perry didn't write her song Right (21:52 - 21:57)
somebody else did and then she did it (21:54 - 21:59)
I'm assuming he wrote this song I mean (21:57 - 22:01)
that's the Assumption everybody probably (21:59 - 22:05)
wrote it with people but yeah yeah (22:01 - 22:05)
yeah no the the song is fine (22:05 - 22:10)
here's the thing people are like oh my (22:08 - 22:12)
God it's going to be in it's gonna be in (22:10 - 22:14)
this in the game and I'm like yeah it's (22:12 - 22:16)
going to be during the credits you're (22:14 - 22:18)
right like (22:16 - 22:20)
every Disney movie when they take a song (22:18 - 22:23)
that was in the movie and then they have (22:20 - 22:25)
two pop stars sing it worse for the (22:23 - 22:28)
credits this is exactly what's going to (22:25 - 22:30)
happen in sword shield so be prepared to (22:28 - 22:32)
walk away when you're doing credits (22:30 - 22:34)
unless you're an Ed Sheeran fan and then (22:32 - 22:36)
stick around (22:34 - 22:38)
I agree with all of the above points but (22:36 - 22:40)
I did like the video I thought it was (22:38 - 22:42)
very cute I really liked how all of his (22:40 - 22:45)
Pokemon had unibrows uh I liked Pikachu (22:42 - 22:47)
like Sound Engineering his session at (22:45 - 22:49)
the end that was good (22:47 - 22:51)
um and I also really enjoyed Pikachu's (22:49 - 22:53)
but trying to wiggle into the game boy (22:51 - 22:55)
yeah that was a good moment I mean we (22:53 - 22:58)
now know that uh Sheeran form Pokemon (22:55 - 23:01)
all have a unibrow so yes that is that (22:58 - 23:03)
isn't a stat when we go to Sheeran (23:01 - 23:04)
universe (23:03 - 23:05)
oh we know what we're setting up for (23:04 - 23:07)
like the video is super cute like I have (23:05 - 23:09)
no issues with the video I thought like (23:07 - 23:11)
the blend of the how they Blended the (23:09 - 23:13)
anime and the real (23:11 - 23:16)
well sections were very cool but again (23:13 - 23:18)
like if you ask me if you held the gun (23:16 - 23:20)
to my head and said sing that song and (23:18 - 23:23)
be like I don't know Celestial it's (23:20 - 23:25)
something in there yeah they they really (23:23 - 23:27)
missed an opportunity not calling it (23:25 - 23:29)
celestila and having like their space (23:27 - 23:32)
duck featuring in it or something (23:29 - 23:35)
there's also like the we're just gonna (23:32 - 23:37)
reanimate some of the first Pokemon (23:35 - 23:39)
movie (23:37 - 23:41)
yeah with Ed Sheeran as of course (23:39 - 23:44)
which I'm like hey if I had money like (23:41 - 23:46)
that I'd be like yeah animate me into (23:44 - 23:49)
this film also with new Pokemon because (23:46 - 23:51)
that's the one time the sword and shield (23:49 - 23:54)
starter show up like the only ten there (23:51 - 23:56)
aren't just pure gen 1 is during the Gen (23:54 - 24:00)
one movie when he attacks Mewtwo with (23:56 - 24:04)
rookie scar buddy and sobble (24:00 - 24:05)
do we think Ed Sheeran played sword and (24:04 - 24:07)
shield and knows what groupies score (24:05 - 24:09)
Bunny and Sable are well there's a sovel (24:07 - 24:13)
plushie in his room okay is are we (24:09 - 24:14)
saying is that actually his house that (24:13 - 24:17)
they're doing it in I don't (24:14 - 24:21)
I'm gonna say no see yeah I'm gonna say (24:17 - 24:23)
it's a set (24:21 - 24:23)
I feel like the the whole like I don't (24:24 - 24:28)
have a cell phone thing really turned me (24:26 - 24:30)
off of Ed Sheeran because I feel like (24:28 - 24:34)
that's very I don't know (24:30 - 24:34)
I don't know how to describe that of (24:34 - 24:38)
like it's like a person that says I (24:36 - 24:40)
don't watch TV or I don't like superhero (24:38 - 24:42)
movies (24:40 - 24:45)
Steve doesn't like superhero movies what (24:42 - 24:47)
what I like the Umbrella Academy that's (24:45 - 24:49)
like a superhero I'm thinking of like (24:47 - 24:52)
Marvel stuff oh yeah yeah yeah I've seen (24:49 - 24:54)
like two Marvel movies (24:52 - 24:56)
I saw Captain Marvel and I'm still not (24:54 - 24:59)
sure what her superpower is uh after (24:56 - 25:01)
watching the whole movie (24:59 - 25:03)
and then I saw the one with the the (25:01 - 25:07)
raccoon that one's pretty good (25:03 - 25:07)
the one with the raccoon Greg which one (25:09 - 25:13)
is that Guardians the Galaxy one or two (25:11 - 25:15)
which one did you watch the first one (25:13 - 25:18)
okay so that is your I don't have a cell (25:15 - 25:19)
phone (25:18 - 25:22)
but but I don't need to watch Marvel (25:19 - 25:24)
movies to get through life he doesn't (25:22 - 25:26)
need a cell phone to get through life (25:24 - 25:27)
that's why he's got personal assistance (25:26 - 25:29)
the dude's Ranch he just pays somebody (25:27 - 25:31)
to have a selfie I had that kind of (25:29 - 25:32)
money and I could have a person like (25:31 - 25:36)
respond to my text believe me I would be (25:32 - 25:38)
waving people off so I could sit on a (25:36 - 25:40)
rock and think about how I would make a (25:38 - 25:41)
Pokemon video (25:40 - 25:44)
heck yeah give me that kind of money (25:41 - 25:46)
but I feel like you were saying like I (25:44 - 25:47)
don't have a cell phone you're probably (25:46 - 25:49)
saying like ah video games are a waste (25:47 - 25:51)
of time like do I really think that Ed (25:49 - 25:53)
Sheeran is riding on his private jet (25:51 - 25:56)
playing original Pokemon Yellow on a (25:53 - 25:59)
Game Boy Color no because one that would (25:56 - 26:01)
require him to have double a batteries (25:59 - 26:04)
two no one's being able to look at the (26:01 - 26:07)
the screen on a Game Boy Color uh I (26:04 - 26:10)
don't know if I really believe assistant (26:07 - 26:10)
special lighting look the personal (26:11 - 26:14)
assistant keeps the Game Boy up and (26:13 - 26:16)
functioning if you think if you think (26:14 - 26:19)
there's not a team called Sheeran Game (26:16 - 26:21)
Boy team that is literally swapping (26:19 - 26:23)
one's in with better screens and be like (26:21 - 26:24)
oh it's gonna be on the plane we need to (26:23 - 26:26)
calm him down quick throw Pokemon Yellow (26:24 - 26:28)
in front of him (26:26 - 26:32)
quick he's still stuck at Giovanni he (26:28 - 26:34)
can't get to the teleporters but we we (26:32 - 26:36)
live in a world now where Ed Sheeran and (26:34 - 26:39)
Toby Fox are making things for Pokemon (26:36 - 26:41)
which is really cool although on the on (26:39 - 26:43)
the flip side I believe Toby fox (26:41 - 26:45)
actually is playing Pokemon games and is (26:43 - 26:47)
is actually like (26:45 - 26:50)
enjoying modern video games where Ed (26:47 - 26:53)
Sheeran's stuck in 1999 with his Game (26:50 - 26:54)
Boy Color (26:53 - 26:57)
so interesting explain more why you feel (26:54 - 26:58)
one person is being truthful and the (26:57 - 27:01)
other isn't (26:58 - 27:01)
because Toby Fox Works in video games (27:02 - 27:06)
this was a musician I I was like oh I (27:09 - 27:14)
don't have a cell phone but I play sword (27:13 - 27:16)
and shield on my switch (27:14 - 27:18)
Toby Fox could have made undertale (27:16 - 27:21)
without playing just a variety of other (27:18 - 27:22)
games I think that's what makes (27:21 - 27:24)
undertale so good (27:22 - 27:26)
is it is it because it like reflects (27:24 - 27:29)
back like a love of (27:26 - 27:31)
video games (27:29 - 27:31)
so what does that have to do with Ed (27:32 - 27:34)
Sheeran (27:33 - 27:36)
oh I'm just saying that it's wild that (27:34 - 27:38)
we have like Toby Fox and Ed Sheeran (27:36 - 27:40)
both making music for Pokemon (27:38 - 27:43)
oh and one of them is lying about love (27:40 - 27:45)
of video games because that's how the (27:43 - 27:47)
world works (27:45 - 27:50)
I asked Toby Fox what Ed Sheeran would (27:47 - 27:52)
tell me and then I do the opposite that (27:50 - 27:55)
I get through the door (27:52 - 27:55)
okay last question here do you think (27:56 - 28:01)
that the song was supposed to be on the (27:58 - 28:04)
the 25th album and then it just didn't (28:01 - 28:06)
make the cut and they were like ah let's (28:04 - 28:08)
just put in the credits of the game (28:06 - 28:11)
no I think that look if you're putting (28:08 - 28:13)
out an album and you're approaching an (28:11 - 28:15)
artist who's a big name you're (28:13 - 28:19)
approaching them long before they need (28:15 - 28:22)
to get their stuff done (28:19 - 28:22)
I I do think the 25th anniversary was a (28:23 - 28:28)
test of how much people will buy regular (28:25 - 28:30)
artists non-pokemon related music (28:28 - 28:32)
and they're like hey cool we can do more (28:30 - 28:34)
and we can get more people to buy this (28:32 - 28:37)
stuff and it's free advertising I mean (28:34 - 28:38)
do you remember when they did the Katy (28:37 - 28:40)
Perry thing they had like a whole (28:38 - 28:42)
dedicated merch store with like (28:40 - 28:46)
10 items that were just what was that (28:42 - 28:49)
song even called electric electric (28:46 - 28:49)
that's exactly how it went yeah again (28:50 - 28:56)
could not tell you a single Melody of (28:52 - 28:57)
that song and I watched a little bit (28:56 - 29:00)
like an h m they're playing it and I'm (28:57 - 29:02)
like oh it's the it's the Pokemon Katy (29:00 - 29:03)
Perry song (29:02 - 29:05)
do you sing along just just like you (29:03 - 29:07)
just did yeah yeah just the electric but (29:05 - 29:09)
that's the only part of the song the (29:07 - 29:12)
only part of song he knows (29:09 - 29:12)
uh that song's okay too (29:13 - 29:18)
they're all okay I mean that's the (29:15 - 29:22)
problem I have with them they're okay (29:18 - 29:22)
all right last minute is before the (29:24 - 29:28)
break uh Pokemon ultimate Journeys the (29:25 - 29:31)
series is to premiere on October 21st (29:28 - 29:35)
exclusively on Netflix (29:31 - 29:36)
um I canceled my Netflix for now mostly (29:35 - 29:38)
because I've been traveling a lot I'll (29:36 - 29:40)
I'll renew it eventually I did I think I (29:38 - 29:42)
finished the Pokemon (29:40 - 29:45)
yeah I finished the whatever we're up to (29:42 - 29:47)
wasn't the last one called Master (29:45 - 29:49)
Journeys (29:47 - 29:52)
yes I feel like ultimate should have (29:49 - 29:55)
come before master (29:52 - 29:55)
probably especially when this one would (29:55 - 30:00)
include the Masters eight yeah yeah I'm (29:57 - 30:02)
okay does ultimate have um because I (30:00 - 30:05)
know penultimate means second last so it (30:02 - 30:06)
does ultimate mean last in which case (30:05 - 30:09)
for it to be the last one unless they (30:06 - 30:11)
make another one in which case it no (30:09 - 30:12)
longer makes sense but right now it like (30:11 - 30:15)
makes sense (30:12 - 30:17)
but Master is also supposed to be the (30:15 - 30:18)
end like there's nowhere to go beyond (30:17 - 30:22)
Master it's not like Master X (30:18 - 30:22)
you can like Master stuff and then keep (30:22 - 30:28)
going on on stuff on other things (30:25 - 30:32)
you can be an ultimate master (30:28 - 30:34)
I guess I just wanted the penultimate (30:32 - 30:35)
meant (30:34 - 30:37)
there you go I've never heard that (30:35 - 30:38)
before you've never heard of penultimate (30:37 - 30:41)
oh wow no I've heard penultimate I've (30:38 - 30:43)
never knew that it was like oh the step (30:41 - 30:45)
before ultimate (30:43 - 30:48)
the second best (30:45 - 30:48)
um (30:49 - 30:51)
I I'm not going to read the description (30:52 - 30:55)
because I guess it would spoil stuff (30:54 - 30:57)
look if you're caught up with the anime (30:55 - 30:58)
you know what's coming if you're not (30:57 - 31:00)
caught up with the anime uh don't read (30:58 - 31:02)
the synopsis because I guess it'll spoil (31:00 - 31:03)
where we're at (31:02 - 31:04)
I guess none of that matters because (31:03 - 31:06)
like the Masters Aid is happening and I (31:04 - 31:08)
think everyone knows what the two final (31:06 - 31:11)
matches I mean you'd have to be living (31:08 - 31:13)
under a rock to not know how Journeys is (31:11 - 31:15)
supposed to end here (31:13 - 31:20)
uh but also on top of the uh Journeys (31:15 - 31:22)
coming on October 21st (31:20 - 31:24)
uh (31:22 - 31:29)
the Arceus Chronicles is also on Netflix (31:24 - 31:33)
as of September 23rd so there is a lot (31:29 - 31:34)
of reasons why I guess you would want to (31:33 - 31:36)
subscribe Netflix is like 20 a month (31:34 - 31:40)
yeah Netflix is expensive uh I'm not (31:36 - 31:43)
saying you know maybe get a login from (31:40 - 31:45)
your friends or family but you can get a (31:43 - 31:46)
login from your friends and family and (31:45 - 31:49)
split the cost (31:46 - 31:50)
I thought they did it where like it did (31:49 - 31:52)
grade your quality if it knows your (31:50 - 31:54)
password sharing (31:52 - 31:56)
could you tell because the quality ain't (31:54 - 31:58)
great and they're not password sharing (31:56 - 31:59)
I'm just in my own house I'm like well (31:58 - 32:02)
this looks garbagey (31:59 - 32:05)
uh I have not watched the Legends Arceus (32:02 - 32:08)
Chronicle things that was that either (32:05 - 32:09)
that was shown at the like the world (32:08 - 32:11)
championship but they had it for some (32:09 - 32:15)
reason they had it outside uh and I know (32:11 - 32:16)
like people were like all right going to (32:15 - 32:18)
the Legends thing and I was like I'm in (32:16 - 32:20)
London why would I waste two hours of my (32:18 - 32:21)
London experience watching something I (32:20 - 32:23)
could watch on my couch number one (32:21 - 32:25)
number two I don't know if you know this (32:23 - 32:26)
but all the chairs are in direct (32:25 - 32:28)
sunlight of this movie and I don't want (32:26 - 32:31)
to be cooked as I'm watching uh a (32:28 - 32:33)
Pokemon movie uh (32:31 - 32:35)
and number three is I heard that some (32:33 - 32:37)
people really liked it and then some (32:35 - 32:39)
people were like it was very generic so (32:37 - 32:41)
that was like pretty much sums up (32:39 - 32:45)
Pokemon anime in a nutshell yep (32:41 - 32:47)
but I'll eventually get around to (32:45 - 32:49)
watching it (32:47 - 32:51)
uh it (32:49 - 32:54)
yeah I that that's that's somewhere on (32:51 - 32:56)
Netflix (32:54 - 32:56)
have you at pangu have you been keeping (32:57 - 33:01)
up with the Pokemon anime or no no the (32:59 - 33:03)
only Pokemon anime I have watched is (33:01 - 33:05)
like some of the very very first season (33:03 - 33:09)
and then the Sinnoh anime like oh that's (33:05 - 33:12)
like the worst one yeah it wasn't great (33:09 - 33:14)
but that's all of the Pokemon anime I (33:12 - 33:15)
have watched (33:14 - 33:17)
Cinema anime is where they're really (33:15 - 33:19)
cheaped out on animators and like famous (33:17 - 33:23)
ones like halfway through the floor (33:19 - 33:23)
Sinnoh has its own set of charms yes (33:24 - 33:29)
they they were just uh concept testing (33:27 - 33:32)
Wiglet with that Mama swine halfway (33:29 - 33:34)
through the floor like what happens if (33:32 - 33:36)
we just hide this Pokemon (33:34 - 33:40)
what happens when sometimes (33:36 - 33:40)
I wonder uh (33:42 - 33:48)
if whatever after during with Pokemon (33:45 - 33:51)
palday uh whatever whatever the new (33:48 - 33:52)
anime is (33:51 - 33:54)
uh I wonder if Netflix is gonna pay the (33:52 - 33:56)
big bucks to keep that on Netflix I (33:54 - 34:00)
would assume so yeah I mean it's it's (33:56 - 34:03)
free for them pretty much they just buy (34:00 - 34:05)
the distribution rights and then it (34:03 - 34:08)
makes the money (34:05 - 34:08)
uh Mr Jose tweeted that there will be (34:09 - 34:18)
Pokemon anime news this upcoming week so (34:13 - 34:20)
after this episode is up and published (34:18 - 34:23)
in Japan so I guess the speculation is (34:20 - 34:25)
they're probably going to show (34:23 - 34:28)
a trailer for (34:25 - 34:31)
the Gen 9 anime (34:28 - 34:34)
I'm sure we'll see Ash I I there was (34:31 - 34:36)
there's been this entire thing (34:34 - 34:37)
throughout all of the three years of (34:36 - 34:39)
sword and shield where Ashton will no (34:37 - 34:42)
longer be the main character yeah right (34:39 - 34:46)
uh and the they're setting it up for go (34:42 - 34:48)
which I feel like anyone saying that has (34:46 - 34:50)
has not watched a single episode of (34:48 - 34:53)
Journeys because go is a very boring (34:50 - 34:57)
character by himself like the reason go (34:53 - 35:01)
works is because Ash is there (34:57 - 35:01)
let go is not particularly (35:01 - 35:07)
go is not main character (35:05 - 35:11)
your main character material (35:07 - 35:11)
go and Ash are at the same level in this (35:12 - 35:17)
series like neither one of them are all (35:15 - 35:19)
that interesting (35:17 - 35:22)
they are more interesting together than (35:19 - 35:24)
apart (35:22 - 35:28)
really really hyper and obnoxious (35:24 - 35:31)
was he not hyper and obnoxious not at (35:28 - 35:32)
these levels (35:31 - 35:34)
you know I don't think he's that I don't (35:32 - 35:38)
think he's bad oh he's bad (35:34 - 35:38)
I I yeah I I like the dynamic of (35:41 - 35:50)
Ash being this emotional (35:46 - 35:52)
like I feel it in my gut kind of make (35:50 - 35:56)
decision which he always has been like (35:52 - 35:58)
he a million percent always has been and (35:56 - 36:02)
then like go being this very logical (35:58 - 36:05)
person and that chemistry is really good (36:02 - 36:06)
um (36:05 - 36:09)
Ash has already won a championship and (36:06 - 36:12)
he's still the main character (36:09 - 36:14)
I I don't think he's winning the Masters (36:12 - 36:15)
eight (36:14 - 36:17)
although if he does win The Masters (36:15 - 36:20)
eight he also won a Lola (36:17 - 36:23)
and he's still the main character so I (36:20 - 36:24)
don't know why they would (36:23 - 36:26)
because they've done they did the thing (36:24 - 36:28)
they they've already set the groundwork (36:26 - 36:31)
of Ash being like I want to be a Pokemon (36:28 - 36:34)
Master he's asked this every like 30 (36:31 - 36:36)
episodes like what are you doing he's (36:34 - 36:38)
like I want to be a Pokemon master and (36:36 - 36:39)
then they go and then the other person (36:38 - 36:42)
goes what's that and then it he never (36:39 - 36:45)
answers that question (36:42 - 36:45)
and everyone's like what and I'm like (36:48 - 36:55)
yeah the kid the kid needs some help is (36:51 - 36:56)
that what they do in one piece though (36:55 - 36:57)
they're like we're looking for the one (36:56 - 36:59)
piece but they never actually say what (36:57 - 37:01)
the one piece is it's one piece of (36:59 - 37:03)
treasure (37:01 - 37:04)
yeah but you don't know what the one (37:03 - 37:06)
piece of trash is no because that's the (37:04 - 37:07)
thing that they're all looking for and (37:06 - 37:08)
then they find it and then the series (37:07 - 37:10)
ends (37:08 - 37:12)
but so they never find it and then the (37:10 - 37:14)
series never ends it didn't it find the (37:12 - 37:17)
end didn't know 582 million episodes (37:14 - 37:21)
because it's still going (37:17 - 37:21)
I'm still going Greg (37:21 - 37:27)
yeah there's there's no way this is (37:24 - 37:28)
what's gonna happen Ash is either gonna (37:27 - 37:30)
win or lose doesn't matter he'll still (37:28 - 37:31)
be the main character and they'll say (37:30 - 37:34)
like go will be like I can't follow you (37:31 - 37:35)
I need to stay for project Mew that's it (37:34 - 37:37)
that's exactly what's gonna happen (37:35 - 37:38)
They're Gonna Keep Joe and then their (37:37 - 37:40)
Ash is gonna be like I can't wait to see (37:38 - 37:41)
you again and he's like yeah friends (37:40 - 37:43)
forever and then we'll never see go (37:41 - 37:45)
again just like you've seen Misty at (37:43 - 37:47)
least twice (37:45 - 37:50)
we have seen Misty and Brock have we (37:47 - 37:53)
seen Tracy at all unless (37:50 - 37:55)
Tracy came back once and I don't (37:53 - 37:56)
remember when (37:55 - 37:59)
I remember Tracy at least being brought (37:56 - 38:01)
up like oh yeah you remember your friend (37:59 - 38:03)
Tracy nah (38:01 - 38:06)
never liked that guy (38:03 - 38:06)
yeah they already Dawn they've brought (38:07 - 38:10)
back (38:09 - 38:13)
aha done a bunch (38:10 - 38:17)
I don't know why God's Great no she's (38:13 - 38:21)
not John's Piplup is great yeah (38:17 - 38:21)
Dawn's not great that Don and Chloe (38:22 - 38:29)
episode was unbearable are you kidding (38:26 - 38:32)
that the Dawn and (38:29 - 38:36)
Chloe episode was literally a shipper's (38:32 - 38:38)
dream I sat there thinking they just (38:36 - 38:40)
turned the script over to a shipper and (38:38 - 38:42)
said write three episodes for us (38:40 - 38:45)
starring Chloe and Don and I think it (38:42 - 38:45)
was (38:45 - 38:50)
did they ever deliver on ship material (38:45 - 38:52)
for those two (38:50 - 38:55)
I who do not ship do not ship fictional (38:52 - 38:57)
characters thought (38:55 - 38:58)
are they trying to get these two (38:57 - 39:01)
together because it really feels like it (38:58 - 39:03)
electric (39:01 - 39:07)
it Celestial is what that is (39:03 - 39:07)
um yeah I don't know (39:08 - 39:14)
they bring back Ash's mom every once in (39:11 - 39:15)
a while (39:14 - 39:17)
good old Delia yeah uh I don't know if (39:15 - 39:22)
we find out the winner to the Masters (39:17 - 39:26)
eight this week or next week I think (39:22 - 39:28)
that I I say that as like (39:26 - 39:31)
unless you don't unless you have the (39:28 - 39:34)
best hashtags muted on Twitter (39:31 - 39:36)
I feel like there's no way you're not (39:34 - 39:38)
going to find out who wins (39:36 - 39:40)
like you're gonna have to like mute like (39:38 - 39:46)
Satoshi Pokemon Masters 8 Leon block (39:40 - 39:47)
half the people that I follow if I'm (39:46 - 39:50)
gonna not be spoiled by it (39:47 - 39:52)
yeah there's there's no way that you (39:50 - 39:54)
you're not going to be spoiled when that (39:52 - 39:56)
happens that was like remember when Ash (39:54 - 39:58)
won like that was like yeah (39:56 - 40:02)
ESPN wrote about Ash winning in the (39:58 - 40:05)
Japanese anime and you're like well I (40:02 - 40:07)
guess I was gonna wait two months for (40:05 - 40:10)
this to come to America but ESPN is out (40:07 - 40:12)
here writing that Ash One the alola (40:10 - 40:16)
league uh so but I guess (40:12 - 40:19)
I I I I don't think he's winning but (40:16 - 40:21)
who knows (40:19 - 40:24)
anyways let's take a break uh when we (40:21 - 40:27)
come back we have uh some Pokemon unite (40:24 - 40:29)
news we're going to talk about temtem uh (40:27 - 40:30)
we have a question of the week no (40:29 - 40:32)
Pokemon a week uh Will's not here so we (40:30 - 40:36)
will be right back (40:32 - 40:36)
from our break uh uh we're gonna talk (40:37 - 40:42)
about Pokemon Unite (40:40 - 40:44)
which I think all three of us play here (40:42 - 40:48)
uh the pincer Pokemon Scizor is now (40:44 - 40:51)
available in Pokemon Unite (40:48 - 40:53)
because they're not the (40:51 - 40:53)
picture there's a lot of wiglets there's (40:56 - 41:00)
a lot of diglets a lot of pincers (40:58 - 41:03)
everybody's Pinson all right uh you can (41:00 - 41:06)
obtain Scizor for 14 (41:03 - 41:08)
000 AOS coins technically that's not (41:06 - 41:12)
true well until a full week is up and (41:08 - 41:14)
then or (41:12 - 41:18)
575 EOS gems (41:14 - 41:21)
uh scissor begins as Scyther you can (41:18 - 41:24)
choose to keep it unevolved Scyther (41:21 - 41:27)
learns dual Wing beat at level five or (41:24 - 41:28)
Moraine Scyther for the remainder of the (41:27 - 41:32)
match uh Scyther learns bullet Punch If (41:28 - 41:34)
Scyther learns bullet punch ll5 it will (41:32 - 41:36)
instead evolve into Scizor for the (41:34 - 41:39)
remain in the match for Scyther speed (41:36 - 41:40)
and damage are the name of the game for (41:39 - 41:42)
Scizor it's durability I think this is (41:40 - 41:44)
one of two Pokemon that can do this the (41:42 - 41:46)
second one will be Clefairy clevery is (41:44 - 41:48)
supposed to yeah (41:46 - 41:52)
uh we have the moves here but for those (41:48 - 41:54)
listening to the podcasts or watching on (41:52 - 41:57)
YouTube that's the that's how you don't (41:54 - 42:00)
evolve it is the level five you either (41:57 - 42:01)
keep dueling beat or you go the bullet (42:00 - 42:04)
put punch route so I'm assuming Clefairy (42:01 - 42:06)
will be the same way (42:04 - 42:10)
uh and it's 14 000 Gems or sorry coins (42:06 - 42:13)
which is the third Pokemon to be that I (42:10 - 42:15)
think it was buzzword yeah (42:13 - 42:18)
was more (42:15 - 42:20)
no I buzzword was more than 14. 14's (42:18 - 42:21)
been the highest (42:20 - 42:25)
I paid for Buzz with coins (42:21 - 42:25)
I think yeah this seems to be the new (42:26 - 42:32)
amount which is insane because they went (42:29 - 42:34)
from like 10 000 being the most (42:32 - 42:37)
expensive to now 14. yeah (42:34 - 42:39)
40. not even Charizard is 14 000. (42:37 - 42:43)
Charizard's on like six (42:39 - 42:43)
um according to I'm looking at my Nero (42:44 - 42:49)
gamer Eurogamer says balls wall was (42:46 - 42:51)
1200. (42:49 - 42:53)
12 000. (42:51 - 42:55)
yeah 12 000 I mean (42:53 - 42:57)
how accurate this is (42:55 - 42:59)
um (42:57 - 42:59)
I don't know if I can check the price of (43:01 - 43:04)
Buzz because I bought it I don't think (43:02 - 43:07)
it shows you after the fact (43:04 - 43:07)
I heard people don't like Scizor I heard (43:07 - 43:13)
he's not good (43:10 - 43:13)
I have played against haven't seemed (43:17 - 43:21)
that annoying so (43:19 - 43:25)
I think the the thing is is that (43:21 - 43:28)
you start the game as a heavy attacker (43:25 - 43:29)
which is Scyther (43:28 - 43:32)
and then if you pick scissor you are (43:29 - 43:34)
playing a different a very different (43:32 - 43:37)
character with a very different (43:34 - 43:38)
set of things that you're supposed to do (43:37 - 43:40)
because basically it becomes a Defender (43:38 - 43:41)
at that point (43:40 - 43:44)
because its durability goes way up but (43:41 - 43:46)
its attack goes isn't great so I think (43:44 - 43:48)
what people (43:46 - 43:51)
are having issues with (43:48 - 43:53)
Scyther is that you are this great (43:51 - 43:56)
attacker and then suddenly you're not (43:53 - 43:59)
suddenly you are a very different role (43:56 - 44:02)
and it's good if you know what you're (43:59 - 44:06)
doing it's bad if you don't (44:02 - 44:10)
it's not wouldn't I like (44:06 - 44:10)
isn't that good though to be able to (44:11 - 44:15)
change on the Fly of like oh this team (44:13 - 44:17)
is really aggressive maybe I want to (44:15 - 44:21)
defeat offender here I think I think a (44:17 - 44:24)
lot of these new unite characters are (44:21 - 44:26)
really meant to shine with people who (44:24 - 44:29)
are really great at the game who are (44:26 - 44:31)
very very skilled and can make that (44:29 - 44:33)
decision like oh we need to be a very (44:31 - 44:35)
aggressive with this team they play very (44:33 - 44:37)
defensive so I'm gonna go the Scyther (44:35 - 44:40)
route or they're super aggressive we (44:37 - 44:41)
need more defense I'm going to go the (44:40 - 44:45)
Sizer Rod I think it it adds a level of (44:41 - 44:48)
con of complexity that wasn't there (44:45 - 44:51)
and you since the way the emblems work (44:48 - 44:54)
you kind of have to decide (44:51 - 44:57)
like a neutral build if you're gonna (44:54 - 44:59)
switch or you're gonna have to lean into (44:57 - 45:01)
one play style (44:59 - 45:04)
um I I think it's the most complicated (45:01 - 45:07)
one they've done so far (45:04 - 45:07)
I agree that is (45:08 - 45:11)
that I'd like actually know what you're (45:10 - 45:13)
doing to get the most out of it I think (45:11 - 45:14)
it's really cool that they've like (45:13 - 45:16)
they've added this in that you can (45:14 - 45:17)
evolve or not involve and they're (45:16 - 45:20)
starting to add more flexibility yeah I (45:17 - 45:22)
think that's cool (45:20 - 45:22)
14 000 gems is a lot though it's a lot (45:24 - 45:30)
um that said I I feel like you get a lot (45:27 - 45:32)
more gems coins coins than you did in (45:30 - 45:34)
the past because I'm still I'm sitting (45:32 - 45:37)
it back I'm back up at 24 and I bought (45:34 - 45:39)
some some unite license I think I (45:37 - 45:41)
finally bought cramerant just so I could (45:39 - 45:43)
have the skins and I'm already back up (45:41 - 45:45)
to where I was before after playing a (45:43 - 45:49)
little bit so I I feel it is (45:45 - 45:52)
more expensive but I think they're also (45:49 - 45:55)
more generous with the coins (45:52 - 45:55)
so I believe the next character is (45:56 - 46:03)
Clefairy coming out next and uh due to (45:58 - 46:04)
the (46:03 - 46:08)
public test server we know that Sableye (46:04 - 46:10)
and zorark are coming next (46:08 - 46:14)
oh yes they are I don't really like to (46:10 - 46:16)
talk about leaks or data stuff (46:14 - 46:18)
um (46:16 - 46:20)
on the show because it's like well is it (46:18 - 46:23)
not confirmed but it's confirmed because (46:20 - 46:26)
unite has a public test server yeah I (46:23 - 46:29)
mean it's different like because the (46:26 - 46:31)
company confirmed by putting out a (46:29 - 46:32)
release saying we're adding these (46:31 - 46:34)
characters to the test server please (46:32 - 46:36)
play with them (46:34 - 46:38)
um (46:36 - 46:38)
test server it is a place where they do (46:40 - 46:47)
test out the balance changes early (46:43 - 46:49)
um how do you get on the public test (46:47 - 46:51)
server I have no clue do you want to be (46:49 - 46:53)
on the public test server to play these (46:51 - 46:55)
characters early I'm gonna say no (46:53 - 46:58)
because every single public test server (46:55 - 47:01)
match I watched seems 10 times worse (46:58 - 47:03)
worse than any ranked battle or any (47:01 - 47:06)
standard battle people will will just go (47:03 - 47:08)
in they'll play for like 60 seconds and (47:06 - 47:11)
then just not play at all (47:08 - 47:16)
and it there's like no real (47:11 - 47:19)
like every you you go on YouTube and you (47:16 - 47:21)
can like look at these Sableye matches (47:19 - 47:23)
or these or Arc matches or or are we um (47:21 - 47:25)
clefable they're all on the public test (47:23 - 47:29)
server yep and I don't think I've ever (47:25 - 47:31)
watched a match that actually felt like (47:29 - 47:34)
a proper match it's just it's like the (47:31 - 47:37)
wild west on the the test server (47:34 - 47:39)
I've seen a few that look like real (47:37 - 47:42)
matches but yeah I mean it is is the (47:39 - 47:44)
test server and people treat it like a (47:42 - 47:47)
test like they go in and goof around and (47:44 - 47:50)
try things and they will line weird (47:47 - 47:53)
situations up to see what happens (47:50 - 47:55)
they'll sometimes work with the other (47:53 - 47:57)
team to be like hey I want to see what (47:55 - 47:59)
this move does so please stand still and (47:57 - 48:01)
don't attack me because I want I'm (47:59 - 48:04)
trying to get information so the test (48:01 - 48:07)
server is a test and people are going to (48:04 - 48:09)
just do things that they are going that (48:07 - 48:13)
that they want to see how it works and (48:09 - 48:15)
since it is a very select group of (48:13 - 48:16)
people that tend to go to the test (48:15 - 48:18)
server they tend to talk to each other (48:16 - 48:21)
and set things up so (48:18 - 48:24)
uh yeah like (48:21 - 48:27)
if you're looking to see how it plays in (48:24 - 48:28)
game (48:27 - 48:30)
you'll maybe get (48:28 - 48:33)
a hint of it on the test server but also (48:30 - 48:35)
understand that what's on the test (48:33 - 48:38)
server may not at all make it to the (48:35 - 48:40)
game (48:38 - 48:40)
uh zorark was added to the test server (48:42 - 48:45)
before save a life so we'll start with (48:44 - 48:48)
zorark first uh zarura has the ability (48:45 - 48:51)
illusion well allows Aurora to turn into (48:48 - 48:54)
an opposing Pokemon in the terms of look (48:51 - 48:56)
uh this could be based off the last (48:54 - 48:58)
Pokemon it attacked (48:56 - 49:01)
uh it has like the basic like scratch (48:58 - 49:05)
attack it has a slash (49:01 - 49:08)
um and it has Fury swipes (49:05 - 49:12)
uh Slash is it it's like a dash dash and (49:08 - 49:14)
then slash (49:12 - 49:17)
um Fury swipes is increases attack speed (49:14 - 49:19)
of the basic attack (49:17 - 49:21)
zorark also has illusion um it has night (49:19 - 49:25)
slash shadowclaw fainted faint attack (49:21 - 49:27)
um (49:25 - 49:29)
it's unite move unleashes a roar (49:27 - 49:31)
damaging the Pokemon who are caught (49:29 - 49:33)
around it (49:31 - 49:33)
uh zorark does exactly what you think (49:33 - 49:38)
Zoroark does it it copies and looks like (49:36 - 49:40)
another Pokemon I believe there's a (49:38 - 49:41)
character like this in League of Legends (49:40 - 49:45)
where they look like another character (49:41 - 49:47)
um I've seen it (49:45 - 49:51)
I've seen zorark copy a Sableye on the (49:47 - 49:54)
other team and then it was Sableye and (49:51 - 49:55)
then the Sable I didn't attack that (49:54 - 49:57)
Sableye even though that didn't make (49:55 - 49:58)
sense because your team can only have (49:57 - 50:01)
one save a lie uh (49:58 - 50:04)
but I was like oh yeah cool and then I (50:01 - 50:05)
watched a game where there were two (50:04 - 50:08)
clefables and I was like oh is this test (50:05 - 50:09)
server broken why are there two (50:08 - 50:11)
clefables at the same team and then I (50:09 - 50:14)
was like I'm dumb one of them zorark uh (50:11 - 50:15)
so (50:14 - 50:20)
I I'm sure it will as much as (50:15 - 50:23)
I I I always bring up Apex Legends (50:20 - 50:23)
because I've played a lot of Apex (50:23 - 50:25)
Legends but there's a character in Apex (50:23 - 50:27)
called Mirage and Mirage can make a (50:25 - 50:30)
clone of himself and all it like all it (50:27 - 50:32)
is is like he sends out himself and he (50:30 - 50:34)
might be running in a direction and you (50:32 - 50:36)
might think like why how would you fall (50:34 - 50:37)
for that it's just a character of (50:36 - 50:38)
running straight in Direction but the (50:37 - 50:41)
amount of times where I've like lined up (50:38 - 50:43)
a shot and then I'm like this is perfect (50:41 - 50:44)
it's gonna be a headshot and then I (50:43 - 50:46)
shoot and then it like disappears (50:44 - 50:48)
because it was like I'm it was fake (50:46 - 50:51)
right and I'm just like ah how did I (50:48 - 50:53)
fall from Iran like how like he's been (50:51 - 50:55)
in the game since day one and I'm like (50:53 - 50:57)
three years later and I'm still falling (50:55 - 51:01)
for like clones I see that very much (50:57 - 51:04)
with Pokemon unite especially because of (51:01 - 51:08)
the the more grass they added to the (51:04 - 51:10)
second map I feel like really would (51:08 - 51:14)
benefit zorark more than that very first (51:10 - 51:15)
map would (51:14 - 51:18)
yeah I also think (51:15 - 51:20)
any time (51:18 - 51:23)
you force the other player to have to (51:20 - 51:25)
pause and think (51:23 - 51:27)
even that second gives you that (51:25 - 51:31)
Advantage so the thing is is like you (51:27 - 51:33)
will appear like the other team's (51:31 - 51:36)
Charizard if that's the last thing you (51:33 - 51:38)
attacked and you may think oh that's (51:36 - 51:39)
because it will look like it's your team (51:38 - 51:41)
member I think that's the thing that (51:39 - 51:44)
I've seen is it matches the colors of (51:41 - 51:46)
your team so you're like oh that's our (51:44 - 51:49)
Charizard who's coming back to base and (51:46 - 51:51)
in that Split Second you'll look at your (51:49 - 51:53)
mini-map and be like wait but that's our (51:51 - 51:55)
like you're already (51:53 - 51:57)
you already are behind the curve because (51:55 - 51:59)
you had to pause for a minute and think (51:57 - 52:02)
wait where's our Charizard where's our (51:59 - 52:05)
whatever is that ours and that gives our (52:02 - 52:07)
Arc the advantage particularly the (52:05 - 52:10)
sneaking in and scoring because when (52:07 - 52:11)
you're focusing on the other team you (52:10 - 52:13)
may not think oh that's our that's our (52:11 - 52:16)
Charmander going back to heal and then (52:13 - 52:18)
you realize no it's not and you'd have (52:16 - 52:20)
to turn around and go back it's it's (52:18 - 52:23)
that subtle gameplay that's just enough (52:20 - 52:26)
to make a difference we'll see how it (52:23 - 52:28)
actually plays out in game if people (52:26 - 52:30)
really fall for it a lot but it does (52:28 - 52:32)
seem like (52:30 - 52:34)
much like the Mirage thing to have to (52:32 - 52:38)
have a moment to think is that mine or (52:34 - 52:41)
is that theirs or is it a zorark (52:38 - 52:45)
is enough to give that an advantage (52:41 - 52:48)
so is the main point of this illusion (52:45 - 52:50)
like it sounds like it you can only (52:48 - 52:52)
imitate like a member of the other team (52:50 - 52:56)
right so like it's like a server I saw (52:52 - 52:59)
them imitating The Substitute doll (52:56 - 53:03)
I saw them imitate Aipom It's usually (52:59 - 53:05)
the last thing that you attacked you can (53:03 - 53:07)
turn into okay because I could see it (53:05 - 53:09)
being like that where you like imitate a (53:07 - 53:10)
member of the other team so you like (53:09 - 53:11)
pretend to be one of them and that's (53:10 - 53:13)
where the confusion is but I could also (53:11 - 53:15)
seeing it being like you said like you (53:13 - 53:18)
imitate of Clefairy on your team so now (53:15 - 53:19)
your team has two Clefairy so the other (53:18 - 53:21)
team doesn't know which Clefairy is the (53:19 - 53:22)
Clefairy right and that being the (53:21 - 53:25)
confusing part (53:22 - 53:25)
yeah I (53:26 - 53:29)
I don't know how useful it is (53:30 - 53:34)
that's like the tough part about it like (53:34 - 53:38)
play style wise (53:36 - 53:40)
um I saw a YouTuber describe zorark as (53:38 - 53:43)
like if you really like Lucario and if (53:40 - 53:44)
you really like Zarina you're gonna (53:43 - 53:46)
really like zorark and that was like (53:44 - 53:48)
enough for me to be like I have zero (53:46 - 53:50)
purchase I have zero desire in playing (53:48 - 53:52)
Zoroark you know because I don't like (53:50 - 53:54)
how Lucario plays and I don't like how (53:52 - 53:56)
Zarina plays (53:54 - 53:58)
um but I know I obviously those those (53:56 - 54:00)
two Pokemon are very popular especially (53:58 - 54:03)
because like they made it to very far in (54:00 - 54:05)
the the World Championships but also (54:03 - 54:07)
like (54:05 - 54:09)
there there are there are a lot of (54:07 - 54:12)
Pokemon that fit a certain (54:09 - 54:15)
um archetype archetype like uh like I (54:12 - 54:17)
would I would put Square bunny Greninja (54:15 - 54:19)
and decidueye all in the same archetype (54:17 - 54:23)
of like long range very narrow (54:19 - 54:26)
uh attacks like yeah I need I need my (54:23 - 54:29)
pyro ball I need my arrows I need my (54:26 - 54:33)
Greninja stars to all go down this very (54:29 - 54:35)
narrow line that I'm setting (54:33 - 54:37)
and I I don't like that I don't like (54:35 - 54:40)
that kind of character (54:37 - 54:40)
um so (54:43 - 54:48)
I it's (54:45 - 54:51)
cool that they've made a character that (54:48 - 54:54)
imitates another character uh (54:51 - 54:55)
conveniently enough Pokemon has had this (54:54 - 54:59)
since generation five so yeah (54:55 - 54:59)
I think the more shocking one is Sableye (55:00 - 55:05)
is getting added uh and I think for a (55:02 - 55:06)
lot of people they didn't think Sable I (55:05 - 55:09)
would be added because he's already in (55:06 - 55:13)
the shop yeah but that was the hint that (55:09 - 55:14)
was the hint that I said all along give (55:13 - 55:16)
me the Sableye in the shop and they (55:14 - 55:18)
listened and they did it so it's like (55:16 - 55:21)
are they ever going to give us like (55:18 - 55:23)
not to as a playable character because (55:21 - 55:25)
not two was an enemy right we haven't (55:23 - 55:28)
seen any of those enemies turn into (55:25 - 55:31)
playable characters yeah it's hard to (55:28 - 55:34)
like we have at this point 900 to choose (55:31 - 55:37)
from and their their decision making of (55:34 - 55:39)
what they're gonna put in is (55:37 - 55:41)
indecipherable (55:39 - 55:44)
because who would have thought (55:41 - 55:48)
they would have put in the weird-headed (55:44 - 55:48)
bird (55:48 - 55:51)
as a super Pokemon yet here we are the (55:48 - 55:55)
Duos in the game running around like a (55:51 - 55:57)
wild bird on the map I'm waiting for (55:55 - 55:59)
them to add my favorite weird-headed (55:57 - 56:01)
bird Ice Cube (55:59 - 56:04)
oh yes you would be good like it wasn't (56:01 - 56:05)
Ice Cube an enemy though you could (56:04 - 56:09)
attack I don't think so no okay not yet (56:05 - 56:12)
yeah we who knows like (56:09 - 56:15)
I could I cannot decipher what they (56:12 - 56:17)
figure out for their release schedule so (56:15 - 56:20)
like I just like whatever I have no idea (56:17 - 56:21)
what's next maybe they just like rotate (56:20 - 56:23)
through the unite like Dev team and (56:21 - 56:24)
they're like this week you pick a (56:23 - 56:28)
Pokemon no I need to be on the dev game (56:24 - 56:30)
I still want like either like draco's (56:28 - 56:32)
old or arctosolt I think those would be (56:30 - 56:35)
so cool or Draco fish not the last one (56:32 - 56:38)
arctovish he's useless do you start the (56:35 - 56:39)
game as a fossil and you just have to (56:38 - 56:43)
sit there and you just hop around (56:39 - 56:48)
okay so stabilizability is prankster uh (56:43 - 56:49)
uh pretty much as long as you're not (56:48 - 56:51)
attacking and as long as no one's (56:49 - 56:54)
attacking you uh you go invisible I'm so (56:51 - 56:57)
excited I like that that's cool I (56:54 - 56:58)
believe it takes about four or five (56:57 - 57:00)
seconds for it to trigger but like when (56:58 - 57:02)
if you attack or you're being attacked (57:00 - 57:04)
it resets that so (57:02 - 57:06)
um like the main the main way you're (57:04 - 57:08)
going invisible is probably like when (57:06 - 57:10)
you die and then you're going back to (57:08 - 57:12)
like get back into battle you're gonna (57:10 - 57:14)
like enter invisible or if you're (57:12 - 57:18)
running away and they cannot reach you (57:14 - 57:20)
um so if they're not playing like a (57:18 - 57:21)
score bunny (57:20 - 57:23)
you will turn invisible so would you be (57:21 - 57:25)
invisible on the mini map too or could (57:23 - 57:26)
you just look at the mini map and see (57:25 - 57:29)
them from what I've seen you are (57:26 - 57:32)
invisible to the other team both on the (57:29 - 57:37)
mini map and on the map that's fun I I (57:32 - 57:38)
know there are probably people listening (57:37 - 57:39)
to that and hearing like you can turn (57:38 - 57:43)
invisible and go that's overpowered (57:39 - 57:44)
I (57:43 - 57:47)
I'm gonna say right now like if you're (57:44 - 57:49)
not constantly attacking enemies to get (57:47 - 57:51)
experience you're probably falling (57:49 - 57:53)
behind and if you're just running around (57:51 - 57:55)
not attacking anything (57:53 - 57:59)
you're probably losing the game (57:55 - 58:01)
well I could I could see it being (57:59 - 58:03)
helpful like sometimes I don't know (58:01 - 58:04)
maybe I'm like playing the game wrong (58:03 - 58:05)
but I feel like sometimes at the end (58:04 - 58:08)
it's just like a Mad Dash to one of like (58:05 - 58:10)
the lanes to like make a dunk and (58:08 - 58:11)
they're just like waiting and sitting (58:10 - 58:12)
and seeing which lane you're gonna go to (58:11 - 58:14)
to stop you but if they can't see you (58:12 - 58:16)
then you can just like run and like die (58:14 - 58:18)
before they can find you I would say (58:16 - 58:20)
yeah you should be attacking things but (58:18 - 58:21)
the way (58:20 - 58:25)
the two abilities move I don't know that (58:21 - 58:28)
that necessarily holds true (58:25 - 58:32)
for Sableye right now (58:28 - 58:32)
is a level (58:32 - 58:38)
in level but I don't think Sableye (58:35 - 58:41)
shines in team fights no not at all (58:38 - 58:44)
there are times when you are going to be (58:41 - 58:46)
like our jungle is clear (58:44 - 58:50)
so now's my time to go layout bombs (58:46 - 58:52)
because that's the thing so let's talk (58:50 - 58:54)
about it you're putting out bombs which (58:52 - 58:57)
I'm so excited for uh so it has it has (58:54 - 58:59)
the it has Thief (58:57 - 59:01)
um it's a dash move (58:59 - 59:03)
uh it will deal damage and decrease (59:01 - 59:05)
their movement speed for a short time if (59:03 - 59:06)
this Pokemon hits a Pokemon from an (59:05 - 59:08)
opposing team it will steal a small (59:06 - 59:10)
amount of their EOS energy if Pokemon (59:08 - 59:12)
don't have AOS energy they will be left (59:10 - 59:14)
unable to attack for a short time (59:12 - 59:17)
um I believe the test server showed its (59:14 - 59:19)
store it sold like five AOS energy yeah (59:17 - 59:22)
that's probably going to be changed (59:19 - 59:26)
uh it has knockoff uh user is uh (59:22 - 59:27)
designated in Direction and then back (59:26 - 59:29)
again while attacking dealing damage to (59:27 - 59:32)
the opposing Pokemon (59:29 - 59:34)
um leaving them unable to attack for a (59:32 - 59:36)
short time uh this move can be used (59:34 - 59:38)
again and again if the user attacks in (59:36 - 59:40)
the front with its claws it will deal (59:38 - 59:42)
damage (59:40 - 59:44)
um (59:42 - 59:46)
this Pokemon will also drop some of (59:44 - 59:48)
their AOS energy collected for a short (59:46 - 59:50)
time (59:48 - 59:50)
um (59:50 - 59:52)
and then there's confused Ray some of (59:54 - 59:59)
these descriptions are super long and (59:57 - 60:01)
yeah (59:59 - 60:03)
it's like kind of hard to describe them (60:01 - 60:06)
like without seeing them in battle (60:03 - 60:07)
um because it's funny because I'll watch (60:06 - 60:09)
I'll watch like YouTubers like they'll (60:07 - 60:10)
read it and they'll be like that doesn't (60:09 - 60:11)
make sense and then they'll like do it (60:10 - 60:13)
and they're like I'm not sure what it's (60:11 - 60:14)
doing and then it's not until like five (60:13 - 60:15)
minutes later they're like oh I finally (60:14 - 60:19)
get what the move does (60:15 - 60:19)
um (60:20 - 60:25)
uh confused Ray uh fires a Sinister Ray (60:20 - 60:27)
in the designated Direction dealing (60:25 - 60:29)
damage to the Pokemon it hits if this (60:27 - 60:30)
move hits a Pokemon from the opposing (60:29 - 60:32)
team it will also leave them confused (60:30 - 60:36)
Pokemon are left unable to attack and (60:32 - 60:38)
will continue to attack nearby Pokemon (60:36 - 60:41)
with basic attacks confused Pokemon will (60:38 - 60:43)
Target the following in a priority order (60:41 - 60:45)
first their Ally Pokemon then wild (60:43 - 60:48)
Pokemon then Pokemon on the user's team (60:45 - 60:50)
it looks like they're only confused for (60:48 - 60:53)
like literally a second uh unless it's (60:50 - 60:54)
like confused right plus plus or (60:53 - 60:56)
whatever then it seems like it's like (60:54 - 60:58)
three seconds (60:56 - 61:00)
uh there's also astonish faint attack (60:58 - 61:03)
Shadow sneak and then Phantom Ambush (61:00 - 61:07)
Phantom Ambush is the unite move (61:03 - 61:08)
um (61:07 - 61:11)
uh Pokemon hit bot Pokemon on the (61:08 - 61:14)
opposing team hit by this move uh are (61:11 - 61:17)
unable to act and will start returning (61:14 - 61:18)
to base (61:17 - 61:21)
if they take damage before returning to (61:18 - 61:24)
base the return effect is canceled and (61:21 - 61:26)
they are left uh unable to act for a (61:24 - 61:28)
short time upon opposing Pokemon hit by (61:26 - 61:31)
this uh (61:28 - 61:33)
who are not facing the user will have (61:31 - 61:36)
their movement speed decreased for a (61:33 - 61:38)
short time (61:36 - 61:38)
uh so there's like a lot of things going (61:39 - 61:44)
on with Sableye one you turn invisible (61:41 - 61:47)
to Phantom Ambush seems (61:44 - 61:52)
similar to wigglytuff's sing whereas (61:47 - 61:54)
like you'll sing to put them to sleep (61:52 - 61:56)
but then your teammate will hit them to (61:54 - 61:57)
wake them up so it's like well why did I (61:56 - 61:59)
even put them to sleep (61:57 - 62:02)
like it's unite move we'll send the (61:59 - 62:04)
Pokemon back to base if they're looking (62:02 - 62:07)
at Sableye when the unite move is there (62:04 - 62:10)
but if you're in a giant team fight like (62:07 - 62:12)
before Rayquaza (62:10 - 62:15)
and you do it and then your team hits (62:12 - 62:17)
those Pokemon like your unite move seems (62:15 - 62:19)
very wasted at that point yeah but often (62:17 - 62:22)
often times when you team is running (62:19 - 62:23)
back and their team is attacking (62:22 - 62:26)
Rayquaza if you can get in front and (62:23 - 62:27)
Flash and they all stop and return to (62:26 - 62:30)
base you have just created the opening (62:27 - 62:32)
to turn the tide like there are very (62:30 - 62:34)
specific ways if you are good with this (62:32 - 62:37)
character that that is incredibly handy (62:34 - 62:39)
if you are the only person defending (62:37 - 62:42)
your bottom Lane and they come at you (62:39 - 62:43)
and you're invisible and you hit them (62:42 - 62:46)
with the unite move you have stopped (62:43 - 62:47)
them from scarring on your bottom Lane (62:46 - 62:49)
while everybody's taking the Reggie up (62:47 - 62:51)
top like there are very specific ways if (62:49 - 62:53)
you can pull this off that this is (62:51 - 62:57)
incredibly good and it's a support and I (62:53 - 62:59)
think that's why it's important to note (62:57 - 63:00)
that like Shadow sneak lets you turn (62:59 - 63:04)
stealth so you can be hiding and stop (63:00 - 63:08)
them and it is actually doing a really (63:04 - 63:10)
strong support function but it is very (63:08 - 63:14)
very specific and you have to be I have (63:10 - 63:16)
feeling much like size or you have to be (63:14 - 63:18)
very good at this character to pull this (63:16 - 63:19)
stuff off (63:18 - 63:22)
or like a hoopa you just yeah you just (63:19 - 63:24)
can't play hoopa and be like yeah this (63:22 - 63:26)
like you need to understand yeah (63:24 - 63:29)
and I still don't get Hoopa I like play (63:26 - 63:30)
with hoopas and I just like I teleport (63:29 - 63:31)
and I'm like I don't know what's (63:30 - 63:33)
happening though just Panic there are (63:31 - 63:34)
many times that I hit a button and Hoopa (63:33 - 63:36)
set something up but I hit the wrong (63:34 - 63:39)
button like where am I how did I end up (63:36 - 63:40)
here (63:39 - 63:42)
um I think the fact that shadow sneak (63:40 - 63:44)
allows you to enter stealth (63:42 - 63:46)
and faint attack that allows you to put (63:44 - 63:49)
fake EOS energy out (63:46 - 63:52)
allows this character to to be slightly (63:49 - 63:55)
under leveled and still do a major (63:52 - 63:57)
function yeah (63:55 - 64:00)
on him and it's like (63:57 - 64:02)
I don't know that you necessarily have (64:00 - 64:05)
to depending on the build worry about (64:02 - 64:06)
being in team fights anymore and (64:05 - 64:08)
leveling as much as everybody else which (64:06 - 64:10)
is kind of the ideal for a support (64:08 - 64:11)
Pokemon (64:10 - 64:16)
who are almost always behind anyways (64:11 - 64:16)
yeah I just like look at Sableye and I'm (64:18 - 64:24)
I I remember watching the world (64:21 - 64:26)
championship stuff (64:24 - 64:28)
and it just doesn't seem like Sableye is (64:26 - 64:30)
like a Pokemon that's picked on a world (64:28 - 64:32)
champion team (64:30 - 64:34)
like Sableye seems like a fun Pokemon (64:32 - 64:36)
seems fun to use seems a little Annoying (64:34 - 64:39)
to play against like it's like for me it (64:36 - 64:41)
like watching people play it it's like I (64:39 - 64:42)
want to spend my coins on that character (64:41 - 64:44)
but then I think back to the (64:42 - 64:46)
championship and I was like I don't see (64:44 - 64:48)
how Save a Life fits on any of these (64:46 - 64:50)
teams with these very skilled players at (64:48 - 64:50)
all (64:50 - 64:53)
oh I disagree I think it's very skilled (64:50 - 64:56)
player who can stop over like a Blissey (64:53 - 64:59)
on the team yeah so the the ability to (64:56 - 65:02)
steal EOS from Pokemon that stack so (64:59 - 65:03)
when Lucario comes running in to get (65:02 - 65:05)
that first deck and you get a thief off (65:03 - 65:08)
you've deprived them of their stack and (65:05 - 65:11)
they have to leave like the ability to (65:08 - 65:13)
snipe those things that are happening in (65:11 - 65:17)
game right now are huge being able to (65:13 - 65:19)
lay out fake EOS energy so that people (65:17 - 65:21)
are distracted to go for the wrong thing (65:19 - 65:24)
and end up being poisoned and hurt by (65:21 - 65:27)
that those are game changing moves I (65:24 - 65:29)
just think that this is one of the (65:27 - 65:31)
things that shines much like a lot of (65:29 - 65:33)
things they're putting out will shine in (65:31 - 65:35)
a person that knows exactly what should (65:33 - 65:37)
be happening in these games and what (65:35 - 65:41)
each character can do because I I it is (65:37 - 65:43)
so frustrating to deal with the stackers (65:41 - 65:45)
right now when no drio is very very (65:43 - 65:48)
annoying if you have a thing that Snipes (65:45 - 65:50)
that five energy away so they don't have (65:48 - 65:53)
a stack anymore (65:50 - 65:56)
huge you've denied them their EOS energy (65:53 - 65:58)
they'll attack weight boost you've (65:56 - 66:00)
stolen a lot from them and that is a (65:58 - 66:02)
huge thing from a support that we don't (66:00 - 66:05)
have right now (66:02 - 66:07)
also and like this is me the very casual (66:05 - 66:09)
Pokemon fan speaking but I feel like (66:07 - 66:11)
like the goal doesn't need to be to have (66:09 - 66:13)
every single Pokemon to be like (66:11 - 66:15)
championship team material like if it's (66:13 - 66:16)
a cool Pokemon with like new gimmicks (66:15 - 66:18)
that that's gonna be like fun to play (66:16 - 66:20)
and get people excited and like want to (66:18 - 66:21)
come back to the game or like want to (66:20 - 66:23)
try something new I think um that's (66:21 - 66:25)
still a good thing to introduce oh yeah (66:23 - 66:28)
I I the minute this drops I'm playing no (66:25 - 66:30)
other Pokemon in that game (66:28 - 66:34)
none this is the only thing I'm playing (66:30 - 66:36)
are you gonna give him Glaceon with you (66:34 - 66:39)
I am on the fence about giving them (66:36 - 66:41)
money (66:39 - 66:42)
you know they're going to do the thing (66:41 - 66:44)
where you can't buy it for a full week (66:42 - 66:47)
unless you use real money I know and I'm (66:44 - 66:49)
I'm actually (66:47 - 66:52)
tempted by that also I played the game a (66:49 - 66:53)
lot and I haven't given them money (66:52 - 66:55)
except for the first time so buying one (66:53 - 66:58)
character does not feel terrible for a (66:55 - 67:01)
game that I play every day (66:58 - 67:04)
um oh my gosh my battle pass expire or (67:01 - 67:06)
not my battle pass my my membership has (67:04 - 67:08)
expired and I have never felt so much (67:06 - 67:11)
relief that gave me so much stress of (67:08 - 67:13)
like did I log in today to collect my 40 (67:11 - 67:15)
Gems or then I'd be like ah it's like (67:13 - 67:18)
705 and it's like no I've missed my 40 (67:15 - 67:21)
gems I didn't log in now it's expired I (67:18 - 67:23)
don't think about it anymore no more (67:21 - 67:26)
gyms I'm free still have not like bought (67:23 - 67:27)
any of the memberships or the battle (67:26 - 67:29)
passes but I like considered it in the (67:27 - 67:31)
space Gengar battle pass because I (67:29 - 67:33)
really wanted spaceganger but I was like (67:31 - 67:34)
you know what I don't want to like (67:33 - 67:35)
stress that I don't want that to happen (67:34 - 67:36)
I don't want to like stress out about (67:35 - 67:38)
having to login and everything but now I (67:36 - 67:40)
have such bad fomo and every time I see (67:38 - 67:42)
a space game girl I'm like I want space (67:40 - 67:44)
Gengar so bad and I wish I had gotten (67:42 - 67:46)
spaceganger yeah I mean they just have (67:44 - 67:48)
it's in (67:46 - 67:51)
in the last battle pass space Gengar was (67:48 - 67:53)
one of the things you could purchase (67:51 - 67:55)
with the additional currency you got out (67:53 - 67:58)
of that battle pass I'll probably come (67:55 - 67:59)
back again okay (67:58 - 68:01)
excuse me so I just look for the like (67:59 - 68:03)
claim all button and I click it and then (68:01 - 68:05)
I don't pay attention to anything else (68:03 - 68:06)
it is (68:05 - 68:08)
the rewards are real (68:06 - 68:10)
real confusing they've got a lot of (68:08 - 68:12)
currency for no good reason (68:10 - 68:15)
uh yes I do (68:12 - 68:17)
no they do have a good reason it's to (68:15 - 68:18)
confuse you and then to get more money (68:17 - 68:21)
out of you yeah or in my case confuse (68:18 - 68:22)
you and then get no money out of you (68:21 - 68:23)
because I don't know where I'm supposed (68:22 - 68:26)
to put my money yeah it's also valid so (68:23 - 68:27)
yeah we have three characters coming (68:26 - 68:30)
Clefairy and then I'm assuming zorark (68:27 - 68:32)
and then save a lie (68:30 - 68:34)
those are all supposed to be for like (68:32 - 68:36)
October I believe (68:34 - 68:38)
uh most likely the way they're doing (68:36 - 68:40)
they'd usually do about two weeks (68:38 - 68:43)
between which means that table I would (68:40 - 68:45)
probably hit the first (68:43 - 68:47)
they could flip it they could give us a (68:45 - 68:49)
lighter like just because the work was (68:47 - 68:52)
added first doesn't mean (68:49 - 68:54)
I feel like Sable and Zork are both like (68:52 - 68:56)
spooky October Pokemon too yeah yeah I (68:54 - 68:58)
think that helps Barry is supposed to be (68:56 - 69:00)
the eighth or something not the eighth (68:58 - 69:02)
the 11th (69:00 - 69:06)
I think it's the 11th (69:02 - 69:06)
so we should get one of the 11th and the (69:06 - 69:11)
25th yeah (69:08 - 69:14)
um but unite wasn't a really bad spot (69:11 - 69:16)
this last couple this last season (69:14 - 69:19)
because Miss they they like redid Mr (69:16 - 69:20)
mime from the ground up which is cool by (69:19 - 69:22)
the way I think it is cool that they (69:20 - 69:26)
were like this character is is so bad no (69:22 - 69:27)
one is using it let's change all of its (69:26 - 69:30)
moves then it was too good (69:27 - 69:32)
and then they like nerfed him after like (69:30 - 69:36)
two weeks but he's still like too good (69:32 - 69:38)
still very annoying to play against so (69:36 - 69:39)
must be good (69:38 - 69:40)
um (69:39 - 69:44)
they just did another big change (69:40 - 69:46)
so the the current as of this recording (69:44 - 69:47)
it's October 2nd I think the current (69:46 - 69:52)
battle pass ends on the fourth (69:47 - 69:55)
and then that's like the Muse the the (69:52 - 69:58)
weird Mew shoe thing is over and there's (69:55 - 70:01)
like a new (69:58 - 70:03)
thing right (70:01 - 70:05)
but the rank season is still because the (70:03 - 70:07)
ranked season is always too (70:05 - 70:10)
the rank battle the ranked seasons are (70:07 - 70:12)
always too (70:10 - 70:14)
costume Seasons I don't know what (70:12 - 70:16)
they're called you know what I mean (70:14 - 70:18)
though I do (70:16 - 70:21)
important two battle pass Seasons it's (70:18 - 70:24)

two costume Seasons yeah welcome to (70:24 - 70:28)
costume season (70:26 - 70:28)
uh okay that was that was your Pokemon (70:29 - 70:32)
unite minute (70:31 - 70:34)
there's a lot there (70:32 - 70:36)
um (70:34 - 70:39)
let's talk about temtem temtem came out (70:36 - 70:41)
if if you don't know what temtem is (70:39 - 70:43)
we've covered it a couple times on this (70:41 - 70:44)
podcast (70:43 - 70:47)
temtem is (70:44 - 70:50)
uh it was a Kickstarter (70:47 - 70:51)
let me pull up the kickstarter page for (70:50 - 70:54)
the sake of this uh this this thing it (70:51 - 70:58)
was a it was a massive multiplayer (70:54 - 71:02)
creature creature collection Adventure (70:58 - 71:07)
this Kickstarter was uh launched on gosh (71:02 - 71:09)
when was this Kickstarter launched oh (71:07 - 71:13)
it's a while ago now so sometime in like (71:09 - 71:16)
2017 I think yeah it's been a long time (71:13 - 71:20)
I I will if if if you were an early bird (71:16 - 71:24)
on the kickstarter you could pay 16 or (71:20 - 71:27)
more you would be come the first backers (71:24 - 71:29)
to receive a discount on the temtem (71:27 - 71:32)
Tamer which would include the digital (71:29 - 71:35)
game for Steam for sixteen dollars the (71:32 - 71:38)
kickstarter exclusive original Tamer cap (71:35 - 71:41)
cosmetic item access to the exclusive (71:38 - 71:44)
backer group in Discord and a high res (71:41 - 71:47)
digital wallpaper that is a that is a (71:44 - 71:50)
great deal I I think so honestly for 16 (71:47 - 71:54)
for a full game uh that was supposed to (71:50 - 71:59)
be estimated delivery September of 2019. (71:54 - 72:01)
uh so why we're talking about this is (71:59 - 72:04)
because one temtem is very Pokemon (72:01 - 72:08)
and two it is now September of 2022 and (72:04 - 72:11)
temtem is officially released (72:08 - 72:14)
yep it is out of beta it is only three (72:11 - 72:17)
years late from the kickstarter which (72:14 - 72:20)
you know (72:17 - 72:20)
it's pretty good for Kickstarter you (72:21 - 72:25)
know within three years (72:23 - 72:26)
um (72:25 - 72:28)
Kickstarter had uh the kickstarter had (72:26 - 72:32)
uh 12 000 backers and it made uh almost (72:28 - 72:34)
six hundred thousand dollars (72:32 - 72:37)
which in reality is I don't feel like (72:34 - 72:39)
that's a lot of money for a video game (72:37 - 72:41)
well like how many people were on that (72:39 - 72:44)
team and worked on it for like five (72:41 - 72:46)
years I feel like oh yeah I don't I (72:44 - 72:47)
don't know whether I had a team for five (72:46 - 72:52)
years is like not that much yeah I mean (72:47 - 72:52)
I gotta be honest I've seen board games (72:52 - 72:59)
go much higher than that it's not a lot (72:56 - 73:00)
I mean half a million dollars is a lot (72:59 - 73:02)
for a small team that's never done (73:00 - 73:03)
anything (73:02 - 73:05)
uh half a million dollars Kickstarter (73:03 - 73:09)
takes what like 20 yeah (73:05 - 73:11)
so like (73:09 - 73:15)
it was enough to get them (73:11 - 73:17)
started for sure and then I'm assuming (73:15 - 73:20)
they got other investors (73:17 - 73:20)
yeah so it's officially out (73:20 - 73:26)
um the the news around this is that uh (73:22 - 73:28)
the Pokemon inspired MMO the stuff (73:26 - 73:32)
Nintendo life has over 1 million players (73:28 - 73:34)
in which I said that the kickstarter (73:32 - 73:35)
sold (73:34 - 73:37)
um (73:35 - 73:38)
12 12 (73:37 - 73:41)
000 backers not everyone was yeah I mean (73:38 - 73:43)
you could pledge a dollar (73:41 - 73:45)
and knock at the game there was 170 (73:43 - 73:46)
people that did not want the game they (73:45 - 73:48)
just pledged a dollar (73:46 - 73:50)
uh (73:48 - 73:52)
so they tweeted a very special (73:50 - 73:54)
announcement today we reached 1 million (73:52 - 73:56)
total users in temtem thank you for (73:54 - 73:58)
making this possible we'll work hard to (73:56 - 74:01)
make the game even better (73:58 - 74:01)
um so that's a lot of people I mean like (74:02 - 74:09)
a million people (74:06 - 74:11)
I'm assuming they're they're saying like (74:09 - 74:15)
registered accounts yeah probably (74:11 - 74:17)
um so I I don't I don't know if like if (74:15 - 74:18)
you bought it on switch because it is (74:17 - 74:20)
available on switch if like you made (74:18 - 74:22)
like two profiles if that counts for (74:20 - 74:23)
like (74:22 - 74:27)
two accounts I'm not sure (74:23 - 74:29)
um (74:27 - 74:32)
but uh (74:29 - 74:35)
when it's funny because like sword and (74:32 - 74:38)
shield has released and has had uh uh (74:35 - 74:42)
two DLCs and we are now gearing up for (74:38 - 74:46)
scarlet and violet and (74:42 - 74:46)
temtem was supposed to be this (74:47 - 74:53)
if you followed the National dex news (74:51 - 74:56)
closely a lot of the National dex people (74:53 - 74:57)
also were the same people saying that (74:56 - 74:59)
temtem was going to be this Pokemon (74:57 - 75:02)
killer and temtem was doing everything (74:59 - 75:04)
right and sword and shield was doing (75:02 - 75:07)
everything wrong temtem had it where you (75:04 - 75:09)
can see other players in the Overworld (75:07 - 75:11)
and so if you were shiny hunting in that (75:09 - 75:13)
game temtem does have shiny hunting (75:11 - 75:16)
they're called Lumas you would see other (75:13 - 75:18)
people spinning a circle in the grass (75:16 - 75:21)
as you spun in the circle in the grass (75:18 - 75:23)
and that in itself was a Pokemon killer (75:21 - 75:26)
because you know sword and shield did (75:23 - 75:27)
not have (75:26 - 75:29)
the ability to watch other people spin (75:27 - 75:30)
in a circle in the ground really key (75:29 - 75:32)
thing missing is ruining the whole (75:30 - 75:35)
experience right (75:32 - 75:37)
um (75:35 - 75:39)
so (75:37 - 75:42)
I think I think it's it's it the (75:39 - 75:44)
perspective is really interesting to see (75:42 - 75:46)
that this (75:44 - 75:48)
game (75:46 - 75:50)
was supposed to be the Pokemon killer (75:48 - 75:52)
before sword and shield came out sword (75:50 - 75:56)
and shield came out had two DLCs and now (75:52 - 75:58)
we're gearing up for a brand new (75:56 - 76:00)
generation of scarlet and violet all in (75:58 - 76:03)
the time that this one single game is (76:00 - 76:06)
now officially out and I whether or not (76:03 - 76:08)
you like sword and shield or you think (76:06 - 76:09)
sword and shield is brushed or you think (76:08 - 76:12)
the trees are bad or you think that game (76:09 - 76:15)
freak is lazy (76:12 - 76:17)
I I can't help but think like capitalism (76:15 - 76:20)
always wins in the sense of like why (76:17 - 76:22)
would they put more effort in the trees (76:20 - 76:24)
when they are putting out a brand new (76:22 - 76:28)
generation in the time that this game (76:24 - 76:33)
has come out and they sold 26 million (76:28 - 76:35)
copies of sword and shield (76:33 - 76:38)
and they're probably going to sell (76:35 - 76:41)
20 plus million copies of scarlet and (76:38 - 76:43)
violet and it's very cool I don't want (76:41 - 76:45)
to like it's very cool that temtem hit a (76:43 - 76:49)
million players oh yeah but (76:45 - 76:52)
I this is why like (76:49 - 76:54)
not this is not the only reason but a (76:52 - 76:57)
big reason of like why Pokemon games (76:54 - 77:01)
don't need to like take longer because (76:57 - 77:04)
they're just going to make another game (77:01 - 77:05)
they're just going to put the things (77:04 - 77:07)
they would have focused on in that game (77:05 - 77:09)
in the new game they will run out of (77:07 - 77:11)
time and then they'll just make another (77:09 - 77:13)
game and put those things in like why (77:11 - 77:15)
stop the cycle (77:13 - 77:19)
that is making you money just put it out (77:15 - 77:22)
and be like yep it's not perfect that's (77:19 - 77:24)
okay there'll be another game in two to (77:22 - 77:25)
three years (77:24 - 77:28)
oh you don't you don't ever stop the (77:25 - 77:30)
money making machine if you stop the (77:28 - 77:33)
money make machine it stops making money (77:30 - 77:35)
yeah (77:33 - 77:38)
uh temtem is massively multiplayer this (77:35 - 77:41)
is their tweet cross play and cross (77:38 - 77:43)
progression (77:41 - 77:47)
fully fledged story campaign 100 Co-op I (77:43 - 77:48)
guess we're getting that scarlet and (77:47 - 77:51)
violet or who knows if maybe it's 95 who (77:48 - 77:53)
knows I don't know I'm not wearing we're (77:51 - 77:56)
getting Co-op let's say it's 100 or 95 (77:53 - 77:57)
because I don't think either of those (77:56 - 78:00)
two things are true RNG free competitive (77:57 - 78:03)
focused battles players customization (78:00 - 78:06)
trading available on switch Xbox PS5 (78:03 - 78:07)
Steam (78:06 - 78:11)
they had a very good uh animated trailer (78:07 - 78:11)
uh but going back to what Greg said on (78:12 - 78:15)
the part of the podcast I got cut out (78:14 - 78:17)
because I forgot record (78:15 - 78:19)
uh (78:17 - 78:22)
Greg you could you could say it again uh (78:19 - 78:24)
I have been very tempted by temtem but (78:22 - 78:26)
the my biggest issue is I don't find it (78:24 - 78:29)
he's attempt I'm cute like I've yet to (78:26 - 78:30)
cry in any of the things that I've (78:29 - 78:33)
watched I and I've watched streamers I (78:30 - 78:35)
have watched videos I've watched all the (78:33 - 78:37)
things to decide do I want to start (78:35 - 78:40)
playing temtem (78:37 - 78:43)
none of the temtem I'm like (78:40 - 78:45)
I have to have that (78:43 - 78:47)
if you want Indie Pokemon with cute (78:45 - 78:50)
monsters you should play ooblets I mean (78:47 - 78:52)
and the thing is I've been tempted by (78:50 - 78:55)
ubless because ooblets is cute (78:52 - 78:57)
um but (78:55 - 78:59)
and no (78:57 - 79:03)
no shade to the game like it it looks (78:59 - 79:06)
very well made and looks very it's well (79:03 - 79:08)
I think it looks very smooth I just (79:06 - 79:11)
don't like the designs I I they just (79:08 - 79:12)
don't (79:11 - 79:16)
they don't appeal there is a (79:12 - 79:16)
I'm going to put this weirdly but there (79:18 - 79:24)
is a level of hyper masculinity in a lot (79:21 - 79:28)
of the designs that turns me off (79:24 - 79:28)
I just can't remember any of the designs (79:29 - 79:34)
but and that too (79:31 - 79:35)
like like when you said that I'm like (79:34 - 79:38)
trying to think of temtems and I I can't (79:35 - 79:40)
think of any of them I could think of (79:38 - 79:42)
the pig with the wings which was like (79:40 - 79:44)
the little plush that they (79:42 - 79:46)
that was part of the kickstarter there's (79:44 - 79:48)
a pig with wings yeah I don't remember (79:46 - 79:50)
what his name is (79:48 - 79:53)
I'm just looking at like the kickstarter (79:50 - 79:56)
page and I see like Metapod I see (79:53 - 79:58)
I see owlette I see Sandile (79:56 - 80:03)
I see luminion I mean from what I want (79:58 - 80:06)
from people who have played and who (80:03 - 80:11)
really really enjoy it like it it does (80:06 - 80:11)
hit what they said it was going to do (80:12 - 80:17)
uh it is a (80:15 - 80:20)
it is a more in-depth storyline that is (80:17 - 80:24)
very Cooperative that and the battles (80:20 - 80:27)
are (80:24 - 80:27)
RNG free more difficult and RNG free yes (80:27 - 80:33)
I remember one of the interviews uh of (80:30 - 80:37)
of the guy saying like he he when he was (80:33 - 80:39)
playing Pokemon he hated that a 90 move (80:37 - 80:41)
would miss and he hated like Critical (80:39 - 80:44)
Hits would turn the tides of like I was (80:41 - 80:45)
doing everything right and I got (80:44 - 80:46)
critical hit (80:45 - 80:48)
there's like pros and cons to that (80:46 - 80:52)
though right like the reason why people (80:48 - 80:56)
are like cheering or Screaming in a (80:52 - 80:58)
world championship matches is because (80:56 - 80:59)
like (80:58 - 81:01)
somebody used play rough and that was (80:59 - 81:04)
like a 10 miss or somebody double (81:01 - 81:06)
protected and the second protect had (81:04 - 81:08)
like a 50 chance of activating and it (81:06 - 81:09)
activated him because it activated they (81:08 - 81:11)
won the game but that was like their (81:09 - 81:14)
best doesn't that didn't come down to (81:11 - 81:17)
like luck per se like yeah sure the luck (81:14 - 81:19)
of like heads or tails but like (81:17 - 81:21)
that is the that was their win condition (81:19 - 81:24)
that was like if they if like they could (81:21 - 81:26)
attack but that didn't matter because (81:24 - 81:27)
they would automatically lose like they (81:26 - 81:29)
had to like hope that the protect (81:27 - 81:30)
activated because that was like the one (81:29 - 81:32)
way they could win (81:30 - 81:34)
like I said the Flying Pig I found it (81:32 - 81:38)
like the whole like RNG free battles is (81:34 - 81:39)
actually the turn off for me because (81:38 - 81:41)
like (81:39 - 81:43)
the thing about Pokemon is (81:41 - 81:46)
good players will still be good players (81:43 - 81:47)
that's why you see like Wolfie Glick it (81:46 - 81:49)
always makes it to like top eight like (81:47 - 81:51)
like one of the best records out there (81:49 - 81:54)
for for Pokemon you like won a Player's (81:51 - 81:55)
Cup he's won a World Championship he's (81:54 - 81:57)
won two Nationals there's no doubt that (81:55 - 81:59)
a player like Wolfie Glick is incredibly (81:57 - 82:01)
talented and very good at what he does (81:59 - 82:04)
he didn't get there just because like he (82:01 - 82:06)
got lucky in every single one of his (82:04 - 82:07)
matches and he got two protects like he (82:06 - 82:08)
understands and knows how to play the (82:07 - 82:09)
game (82:08 - 82:12)
um but like yeah sure there's RNG a part (82:09 - 82:13)
of it but (82:12 - 82:16)
I as a brand new player to (82:13 - 82:19)
uh Pokemon I still have a chance of (82:16 - 82:21)
beating Wolfie Glick right I still have (82:19 - 82:23)
a chance of of hitting Thunder Wave and (82:21 - 82:25)
him being paralyzed I have a still a (82:23 - 82:26)
chance of like not getting crit or him (82:25 - 82:28)
missing a rock slide or me getting crit (82:26 - 82:32)
like I as a new player can still win a (82:28 - 82:35)
match against very good players because (82:32 - 82:38)
of RNG because of luck because of them (82:35 - 82:42)
risking a 90 move or an 80 move (82:38 - 82:45)
whereas when you remove all of the RNG (82:42 - 82:47)
your game becomes chess there is no (82:45 - 82:51)
there is no RNG in chess there and it is (82:47 - 82:53)
impossible for somebody who's been (82:51 - 82:55)
playing chess for two weeks to beat (82:53 - 82:57)
somebody who's been playing chess for 10 (82:55 - 83:00)
years like you just can't do it (82:57 - 83:01)
um (83:00 - 83:05)
so I don't think that's like super (83:01 - 83:08)
healthy for the longevity of like a (83:05 - 83:10)
competitive focused (83:08 - 83:12)
game like this (83:10 - 83:15)
but I don't know it was a selling point (83:12 - 83:17)
and so people were like into that like (83:15 - 83:21)
yes Critical Hits too but like ah four (83:17 - 83:24)
four and MMO (83:21 - 83:26)
that is (83:24 - 83:29)
unnecessary component right like (83:26 - 83:32)
if you are doing an end raid boss (83:29 - 83:34)
because there's an entire PVE section (83:32 - 83:36)
and there are raids and there are (83:34 - 83:39)
difficult dungeons you don't want to (83:36 - 83:41)
have gone through a 17 (83:39 - 83:46)
room dungeon to have an RNG Miss at the (83:41 - 83:48)
end and not complete the dungeon right (83:46 - 83:51)
like they have to they have to do what (83:48 - 83:54)
Pokemon doesn't have to do which is (83:51 - 83:57)
do an MMO balance with a competitive (83:54 - 84:01)
balance and even MMOs struggle with the (83:57 - 84:06)
PVP versus PVE balance so adding RNG on (84:01 - 84:08)
top of a PVE experience when you want (84:06 - 84:10)
people to do weekly challenges and (84:08 - 84:14)
weekly dungeons makes a really bad PVE (84:10 - 84:16)
experience (84:14 - 84:17)
so (84:16 - 84:20)
I get it like they have a different (84:17 - 84:23)
focus of this game and I can see how (84:20 - 84:29)
they are building strategy around their (84:23 - 84:32)
end game for PVP and it will become (84:29 - 84:36)
different if the game goes longer but (84:32 - 84:38)
right now watching PV (84:36 - 84:42)
P battles I see all the same things (84:38 - 84:43)
and they all switching and do all the (84:42 - 84:47)
same stuff I mean it is it is a it is a (84:43 - 84:49)
meta that is in a very specific set way (84:47 - 84:52)
because (84:49 - 84:54)
the minute like the announcer's like oh (84:52 - 84:55)
they're going to bring this in because (84:54 - 84:57)
it's going to do this and it absolutely (84:55 - 84:59)
doesn't there isn't a lot of risks (84:57 - 85:03)
because it is a lot of pre-planning and (84:59 - 85:06)
just knowing like like knowing all the (85:03 - 85:08)
moves in chess knowing that what some (85:06 - 85:10)
what somebody's Gambit in chess is you (85:08 - 85:12)
immediately know how to counter it (85:10 - 85:15)
that's a lot what's Happening Here (85:12 - 85:17)
um and I (85:15 - 85:20)
it's a different experience I'm not (85:17 - 85:21)
gonna say it's a better or worse (85:20 - 85:22)
experience because (85:21 - 85:25)
you kind of need to have a non-rng (85:22 - 85:29)
attack system to be able to fight uh a (85:25 - 85:32)
tough boss like I get it I just don't (85:29 - 85:36)
know if I find that (85:32 - 85:36)
compelling enough (85:36 - 85:40)
yeah I think that's a really good point (85:38 - 85:42)
about like what you want for PVP versus (85:40 - 85:44)
PVE because I I agree with all of the (85:42 - 85:45)
above points that like you probably (85:44 - 85:47)
don't want it in a PVE situation because (85:45 - 85:49)
that's just like really annoying but for (85:47 - 85:51)
PVP like I agree with everything Steve (85:49 - 85:53)
said and then also (85:51 - 85:55)
um I think like not not just like if (85:53 - 85:56)
you're a new player you have a chance of (85:55 - 85:58)
winning but um like it adds an element (85:56 - 86:00)
of like excitement and unpredictability (85:58 - 86:02)
to a game so that like like when the (86:00 - 86:04)
crowd's cheering it's because like a 10 (86:02 - 86:06)
thing happened that like probably (86:04 - 86:08)
wouldn't have happened but happened and (86:06 - 86:09)
it's like an exciting new twist and now (86:08 - 86:11)
these like players have to adapt to it (86:09 - 86:12)
and I think that's really interesting (86:11 - 86:15)
and exciting and like a PVP context (86:12 - 86:17)
um but yeah I don't know maybe this is (86:15 - 86:19)
me being like very cynical and jaded but (86:17 - 86:21)
it feels to me that people like yelling (86:19 - 86:24)
for no RNG are the people who are like (86:21 - 86:26)
losing and they're like it's because of (86:24 - 86:28)
the RNG so take away the RNG and (86:26 - 86:29)
everything will be better (86:28 - 86:31)
um but I don't know if that's true or (86:29 - 86:33)
not I mean there's there's absolutely (86:31 - 86:36)
part that's absolutely part of what (86:33 - 86:38)
people's frustrations are right like (86:36 - 86:43)
when you miss a move and that was your (86:38 - 86:46)
one way of winning and if it had like if (86:43 - 86:48)
it had hit that would have been the (86:46 - 86:51)
outcome for you and it didn't like that (86:48 - 86:53)
is a very frustrating experience but (86:51 - 86:56)
you'll also know that going in yeah and (86:53 - 86:57)
that's also on the other side though (86:56 - 86:59)
like I can I can I can reflect all like (86:57 - 87:01)
I do a lot of competitive battling on (86:59 - 87:04)
stream and like I can I can easily say (87:01 - 87:05)
like oh I only won that match because I (87:04 - 87:07)
hit that crit or I only won that match (87:05 - 87:10)
because like I hit that 90 move or they (87:07 - 87:12)
they missed their rock slide and because (87:10 - 87:13)
they missed their rock slide I win like (87:12 - 87:16)
yeah it's like it's a confirmation bias (87:13 - 87:17)
thing like when it happens not in your (87:16 - 87:19)
favorite like really sticks out but um (87:17 - 87:21)
it doesn't feel like it happens in your (87:19 - 87:23)
favor just as much right and if it does (87:21 - 87:25)
there's a lot of confirmation bias in (87:23 - 87:29)
that stuff but also (87:25 - 87:32)
they're different games right like there (87:29 - 87:34)
aren't I mean (87:32 - 87:36)
it is frustrating to do a Dynamax (87:34 - 87:37)
adventure and you get a sense of this (87:36 - 87:40)
when you're at the final (87:37 - 87:43)
boss and you miss the move right like (87:40 - 87:46)
you have gone all of this way and you (87:43 - 87:50)
don't defeat the final boss it is a very (87:46 - 87:52)
frustrating experience the difference is (87:50 - 87:55)
that Pokemon compensates it by allowing (87:52 - 87:57)
you to go right back in and try it again (87:55 - 87:59)
whereas most MMOs are like that was your (87:57 - 88:03)
one shot for the week you lost (87:59 - 88:05)
come back next week (88:03 - 88:07)
um and that's a very negative experience (88:05 - 88:10)
for a lot of people that I think they (88:07 - 88:12)
are (88:10 - 88:14)
trying to (88:12 - 88:16)
make a game that appeals to their (88:14 - 88:18)
sensibilities and great like that's what (88:16 - 88:20)
that's it's they're literally doing what (88:18 - 88:22)
everybody says snarkily if you don't (88:20 - 88:24)
like it make your own game they didn't (88:22 - 88:25)
like it they made their own (88:24 - 88:28)
congratulations do you have a game that (88:25 - 88:30)
people are actually enjoying that's a (88:28 - 88:34)
success a million people is a lot (88:30 - 88:34)
the other the last thing I want to say (88:37 - 88:41)
about temtem is like the weird type (88:39 - 88:43)
chart they have going on uh they have (88:41 - 88:47)
like they have neutral fire water nature (88:43 - 88:50)
which I think is Grass Electric Earth (88:47 - 88:53)
mental which I think is psychic wind (88:50 - 88:57)
digital mealy Crystal toxic (88:53 - 88:59)
so you can see that it's it's slightly (88:57 - 89:01)
different their type chart looks exactly (88:59 - 89:03)
like a Pokemon type chart I don't know (89:01 - 89:05)
if there's another way to do type charts (89:03 - 89:07)
besides like look I'm in the middle of (89:05 - 89:10)
making a Pokemon RPG and the type chart (89:07 - 89:13)
and types (89:10 - 89:15)
nightmare literally the worst thing I've (89:13 - 89:18)
ever done in making a game because it is (89:15 - 89:20)
so frustrating to come up with (89:18 - 89:23)
interesting words interesting types and (89:20 - 89:26)
then figuring out how to do (89:23 - 89:29)
what's stronger get like I spent four (89:26 - 89:32)
days literally with a spreadsheet going (89:29 - 89:34)
nope that doesn't work start over again (89:32 - 89:37)
nope that doesn't work start over again (89:34 - 89:39)
I spent four days coming up with (89:37 - 89:41)
something (89:39 - 89:45)
it's tough I blog (89:41 - 89:48)
yeah so like there's there's only so (89:45 - 89:51)
many ways to say like fire is weak to (89:48 - 89:54)
water but strong against nature slash (89:51 - 89:56)
grass right (89:54 - 89:58)
um but when I played temtem I played in (89:56 - 90:02)
the alpha I think before beta (89:58 - 90:03)
um (90:02 - 90:07)
it made me appreciate Pokemon more in (90:03 - 90:08)
the sense of like (90:07 - 90:11)
the thing I hear (90:08 - 90:15)
a lot is uh well I get you know you get (90:11 - 90:16)
a lot of jaded people on Twitch but you (90:15 - 90:17)
get the person that comes in and they're (90:16 - 90:21)
like I wish Pokemon games were harder (90:17 - 90:23)
um and I've talked about this before but (90:21 - 90:25)
like the two examples I have is is (90:23 - 90:27)
temtem and is watching my friend play (90:25 - 90:29)
sword and shield (90:27 - 90:33)
um and and I think it's it I think to me (90:29 - 90:35)
the pers the the the perception I have (90:33 - 90:37)
is like it's not really that hard (90:35 - 90:40)
because you know (90:37 - 90:42)
you know what you're doing and you can't (90:40 - 90:44)
unlearn that and what I mean by that is (90:42 - 90:46)
like you know that like electric can't (90:44 - 90:48)
hit ground you know that electric is (90:46 - 90:50)
super effective against flying you know (90:48 - 90:53)
that fairy hits Dragon really hard you (90:50 - 90:55)
know that steel is super effective (90:53 - 90:58)
against Ferry you know these things and (90:55 - 90:59)
you know the Pokemon you're fighting (90:58 - 91:02)
against so when you're in a battle (90:59 - 91:05)
and you have a fire Pokemon in front of (91:02 - 91:07)
you and you're you have a Gyarados why (91:05 - 91:09)
would you not hit waterfall like you you (91:07 - 91:11)
know what to do you know your best move (91:09 - 91:13)
is to hit waterfall and if you hit (91:11 - 91:15)
waterfall and you one shot that Rapidash (91:13 - 91:16)
and then the next Pokemon that comes out (91:15 - 91:18)
is nine tails and you're like I have (91:16 - 91:20)
three other moves but waterfall is my (91:18 - 91:22)
best move so I'm going to hit it again (91:20 - 91:24)
and then they they send out a Graveler (91:22 - 91:27)
and you're like well (91:24 - 91:29)
my best move is waterfall so I'm gonna (91:27 - 91:32)
hit that again and you you've easily won (91:29 - 91:35)
the battle when I played temtem I (91:32 - 91:37)
couldn't do that because one I didn't (91:35 - 91:39)
know what I was looking at because I (91:37 - 91:41)
can't like I don't know fake Greninja is (91:39 - 91:43)
against me I'm gonna assume he's (91:41 - 91:46)
watertight like but he's not he's he's (91:43 - 91:50)
he's toxic type I have what is super (91:46 - 91:52)
effective against toxic I gotta look at (91:50 - 91:53)
this type chart (91:52 - 91:56)
um wind is okay I don't have any wind I (91:53 - 91:57)
don't even know what a wind Pokemon (91:56 - 92:00)
looks like and like all of a sudden I (91:57 - 92:02)
start losing these battles because like (92:00 - 92:05)
I don't know their type chart and I (92:02 - 92:08)
don't know what creature that is like (92:05 - 92:10)
there's like the thing about temtem is (92:08 - 92:12)
at least like Pokemon when you like look (92:10 - 92:14)
at something like an infidip you're like (92:12 - 92:15)
ah you kind of look fairy oh you are (92:14 - 92:18)
fairy or like oh like you you're a rock (92:15 - 92:20)
with arms I bet you're a rock type oh (92:18 - 92:22)
yep you are okay I know rock is weaked (92:20 - 92:23)
against water like (92:22 - 92:26)
like you but but if you're brand new to (92:23 - 92:28)
Pokemon you would probably have those (92:26 - 92:31)
same struggles oh yeah as you would so I (92:28 - 92:33)
think that's the thing that I like try (92:31 - 92:35)
to like point out and there's not like a (92:33 - 92:37)
quick way of explaining that to people (92:35 - 92:41)
is like once you learn the type chart in (92:37 - 92:43)
Pokemon it becomes so much easier (92:41 - 92:48)
because you you know what works and uh (92:43 - 92:50)
another interest so like to bring this (92:48 - 92:52)
back to Pokemon I was watching a friend (92:50 - 92:55)
play sword and shield at his house (92:52 - 92:57)
um he's like he like he was like stuck (92:55 - 93:00)
in Glenwood tangle and I've like I've (92:57 - 93:01)
been friends with them for over 10 years (93:00 - 93:03)
like we played heart gold soul silver (93:01 - 93:04)
together we play black and white (93:03 - 93:06)
together we played black two like we (93:04 - 93:07)
played like every Pokemon game together (93:06 - 93:10)
when we we lived in the same state (93:07 - 93:13)
and I I watched him like I know he like (93:10 - 93:14)
and he plays like Destiny like he plays (93:13 - 93:16)
a million video games like he's he's not (93:14 - 93:18)
a casual player and I watched him almost (93:16 - 93:21)
lose to an impedimp because he just (93:18 - 93:23)
didn't know what type it was (93:21 - 93:25)
and he was like oh I'm gonna use a I'm (93:23 - 93:26)
gonna use this move oh it's not (93:25 - 93:28)
effective okay I'm gonna use this move (93:26 - 93:31)
and like it was just really interesting (93:28 - 93:33)
watching him like his team was over (93:31 - 93:37)
leveled he had all six Pokemon and like (93:33 - 93:39)
he just almost lost the impotent because (93:37 - 93:41)
like he wasn't hitting (93:39 - 93:44)
I didn't say anything the entire time he (93:41 - 93:46)
had the he had the super effective moves (93:44 - 93:48)
like all he had to do was hit it and he (93:46 - 93:49)
would one shot it but he was like I'm (93:48 - 93:51)
gonna use this move oh it's not very (93:49 - 93:53)
effective oh I'm dead okay I'll try to (93:51 - 93:56)
this and it was just it kind of just (93:53 - 93:57)
showed that like the people who like (93:56 - 93:58)
rushed into my twitch stream and they're (93:57 - 94:01)
like Pokemon's too easy it's like you (93:58 - 94:02)
just you have a really good (94:01 - 94:04)
understanding of the game and you can't (94:02 - 94:06)
unlearn that (94:04 - 94:11)
um and I don't know how (94:06 - 94:13)
unless they add like a hard mode or (94:11 - 94:16)
something but like even if uh even if (94:13 - 94:18)
the Pokemon was like even if that (94:16 - 94:20)
Graveler was five levels higher I'm (94:18 - 94:22)
still gonna hit the waterfall button (94:20 - 94:24)
because that's still the best button to (94:22 - 94:25)
hit like (94:24 - 94:26)
foreign (94:25 - 94:28)
yeah I still remember the first time I (94:26 - 94:30)
saw pseudo wudo and I was like why will (94:28 - 94:33)
this thing not die to my fire it's like (94:30 - 94:35)
clearly a grass Pokemon what is (94:33 - 94:36)
happening and it was like the most (94:35 - 94:39)
frustrating thing ever (94:36 - 94:39)
it kind of goes back to that whole like (94:40 - 94:44)
Whitney argument of like oh Whitney's so (94:42 - 94:46)
tough and it's like (94:44 - 94:48)
you know there's a whole Cave of rock (94:46 - 94:51)
Pokemon right before Whitney and roll (94:48 - 94:53)
out the move that you're complaining (94:51 - 94:54)
about (94:53 - 94:58)
is a rock type move it does no damage to (94:54 - 95:01)
like a Geodude or an onyx or whatever (94:58 - 95:03)
else is in that cave like (95:01 - 95:05)
like it's really easy to survive a (95:03 - 95:07)
rollout if you sent out I was like well (95:05 - 95:10)
I don't want to use a Geo dude I don't (95:07 - 95:13)
blame them (95:10 - 95:13)
totally valid (95:14 - 95:18)
um oh good you know good for temtem uh (95:16 - 95:20)
they got a million people (95:18 - 95:23)
I (95:20 - 95:23)
you know I probably would have played (95:23 - 95:27)
this game if it came out maybe earlier (95:26 - 95:29)
in the year it's very close to scarlet (95:27 - 95:32)
and violence yeah I think that's also my (95:29 - 95:33)
issue like I know I have something (95:32 - 95:35)
coming I don't want to get into another (95:33 - 95:38)
MMO I'm in an MMO that I really really (95:35 - 95:40)
really really really really love (95:38 - 95:43)
so adding another one is just like or I (95:40 - 95:45)
could be doing my the one thing that (95:43 - 95:48)
I've really invested a lot of time in (95:45 - 95:52)
Pokemon Unite yeah all right question of (95:48 - 95:53)
the week (95:52 - 95:55)
uh (95:53 - 95:57)
uh uh (95:55 - 96:00)
how are we here did we no did we have (95:57 - 96:02)
another thing the battle pass thing are (96:00 - 96:06)
we skipping that oh yeah we talked about (96:02 - 96:08)
symptom a lot all right just one thing (96:06 - 96:10)
temtem has a battle pass if you think (96:08 - 96:12)
that's new in MMOs (96:10 - 96:14)
look at an MMO (96:12 - 96:15)
like (96:14 - 96:17)
yeah there were there were there was (96:15 - 96:20)
okay the the the the short of it is temp (96:17 - 96:22)
time was getting review bombed and the (96:20 - 96:23)
devs complained about please don't (96:22 - 96:25)
review bomb us because they did have a (96:23 - 96:28)
battle pass uh and the battle pass (96:25 - 96:32)
was only cosmetic stuff (96:28 - 96:34)
so you would pay real money for the (96:32 - 96:37)
battle pass the temtem is like a 50 game (96:34 - 96:38)
it's not (96:37 - 96:40)
it's not like a free to play game it is (96:38 - 96:42)
so people were like you're charging us (96:40 - 96:44)
full price for a game and you're (96:42 - 96:46)
charging us for a battle pass (96:44 - 96:48)
and they're like look we want this game (96:46 - 96:50)
to last a long time the battle pass was (96:48 - 96:52)
something that was talked about in the (96:50 - 96:54)
kickstarter (96:52 - 96:56)
uh everything in the battle pass is (96:54 - 96:59)
purely cosmetic (96:56 - 97:00)
I don't personally have a problem with (96:59 - 97:02)
that what tell me you don't play MMOs (97:00 - 97:04)
like (97:02 - 97:09)
I buy a 30 expansion and then I pay (97:04 - 97:11)
12.95 a month (97:09 - 97:14)
to keep playing the game that is the MMO (97:11 - 97:17)
model that is what an MMO (97:14 - 97:19)
is unless it's free to play and which is (97:17 - 97:22)
going to make you micro transaction like (97:19 - 97:26)
this is the MMO model and I when I read (97:22 - 97:28)
the article I'm like (97:26 - 97:31)
I cannot believe people are upset about (97:28 - 97:34)
the standard MMO model (97:31 - 97:36)
well you don't even have to buy the (97:34 - 97:38)
battle pass by the battle but you don't (97:36 - 97:40)
even have to do it it's not even it's (97:38 - 97:41)
not even the same (97:40 - 97:43)
and it also said in this article that (97:41 - 97:44)
like they made it so purchasing one (97:43 - 97:46)
battle PASS gives you enough currency to (97:44 - 97:48)
purchase the next for free so like once (97:46 - 97:49)
you get one you just get like endless (97:48 - 97:51)
free battle passes yeah and I'm like (97:49 - 97:53)
that doesn't seem any different to like (97:51 - 97:56)
paid PLC for a full price game yeah yeah (97:53 - 97:58)
Apex Legends does that too like you you (97:56 - 98:00)
theoretically you have to complete the (97:58 - 98:02)
battle pass right if you buy it and you (98:00 - 98:03)
don't let you get to level five you're (98:02 - 98:05)
not gonna get your currency back but (98:03 - 98:07)
like Apex has it too where if you pay I (98:05 - 98:09)
think it's like eight bucks but if you (98:07 - 98:10)
make it to the end of the battle pass (98:09 - 98:12)
you get enough coins when the next (98:10 - 98:13)
battle pass comes out you just buy with (98:12 - 98:15)
coins and you can just do the same thing (98:13 - 98:16)
yeah (98:15 - 98:18)
yeah but the paragraph where it was like (98:16 - 98:20)
phrases such as corporate greed and (98:18 - 98:22)
Corruption are being bandied around yeah (98:20 - 98:25)
that was just like okay okay okay (98:22 - 98:29)
dial it back Dem Tim fan base this is an (98:25 - 98:31)
MMO this is what this is what you signed (98:29 - 98:32)
up for (98:31 - 98:33)
all right now we can do the question of (98:32 - 98:35)
the week ready yes (98:33 - 98:38)
now is the time for the question of the (98:35 - 98:41)
week (98:38 - 98:41)
uh this is from squat in tacos on our (98:41 - 98:47)
YouTube If you are watching on YouTube (98:45 - 98:50)
Now's the Time to like comment subscribe (98:47 - 98:53)
doing squats and Tacos which is clanging (98:50 - 98:54)
and banging and then going for tacos (98:53 - 98:56)
after correct (98:54 - 98:59)
uh after playing the faithful remake (98:56 - 99:02)
bdsp it made me think of what I want in (98:59 - 99:05)
remix moving forward good thinking I (99:02 - 99:06)
think I would appreciate uh the (99:05 - 99:08)
direction of return to a region over (99:06 - 99:10)
remaking a game same region new gym (99:08 - 99:13)
leaders different types new storyline so (99:10 - 99:15)
my question is which region would you (99:13 - 99:17)
want a new story to return to and what (99:15 - 99:19)
changes would you like to see place in (99:17 - 99:20)
place (99:19 - 99:23)
I mean I would love to go back to Kanto (99:20 - 99:26)
and not play Kanto again (99:23 - 99:29)
uh (99:26 - 99:29)
technically yes (99:30 - 99:35)
technically no um is this not just like (99:32 - 99:37)
a sequel instead of a remake Yeah so (99:35 - 99:39)
basically black to white too instead of (99:37 - 99:42)
like black White remix (99:39 - 99:44)
yeah I mean yeah Black 2 White 2 was you (99:42 - 99:47)
know new gym leaders it was the same (99:44 - 99:49)
region but you started on the other side (99:47 - 99:50)
of the map (99:49 - 99:52)
um some new gym leaders some new gym (99:50 - 99:54)
leaders (99:52 - 99:56)
um I mean I would like to go back to I (99:54 - 100:00)
would like to see a a sequel to Kanto (99:56 - 100:01)
that has (100:00 - 100:03)
because I think the I think that's one (100:01 - 100:06)
of the best maps they've ever made (100:03 - 100:09)
um as tur as far as things are laid out (100:06 - 100:11)
and there's like a a pretty good (100:09 - 100:14)
progression of how you get to things (100:11 - 100:17)
um I I think that it'd be good to come (100:14 - 100:20)
back to a region where they're like we (100:17 - 100:22)
started it here but people have moved on (100:20 - 100:24)
and the world is different and we (100:22 - 100:28)
discovered new types and Team Rocket is (100:24 - 100:30)
technically disbanded so what's the new (100:28 - 100:32)
threat in this area like there's a lot (100:30 - 100:34)
of story there that has just never (100:32 - 100:37)
touched on all the remakes (100:34 - 100:38)
um like and you get a (100:37 - 100:42)
hint of it uh in gold and silver but (100:38 - 100:45)
really not much they're like yep they (100:42 - 100:46)
wear different clothing now because it's (100:45 - 100:48)
only been two years like show me what (100:46 - 100:52)
okay candle looks like 25 years after (100:48 - 100:56)
now Giovanni is I don't know (100:52 - 100:58)
move down to the Home Shopping Network (100:56 - 101:01)
as his new career like show me what that (100:58 - 101:02)
world is like (101:01 - 101:05)
um there's new types so do the you know (101:02 - 101:07)
the (101:05 - 101:10)
Gym Leaders lose and change like I I (101:07 - 101:12)
would love to see a Canto that is just (101:10 - 101:15)
not replaying red and blue for the four (101:12 - 101:18)
bajillionth time is that kind of let's (101:15 - 101:20)
go (101:18 - 101:23)
it's kind of except let's go has all the (101:20 - 101:24)
same (101:23 - 101:27)
gym leaders I guess so it is totally (101:24 - 101:29)
different though (101:27 - 101:33)
slightly yeah I mean like what's I'm (101:29 - 101:34)
actually like we're talking in this like (101:33 - 101:37)
a major revamp yes yes totally and like (101:34 - 101:42)
slightly ain't doing it at all (101:37 - 101:42)
um I'm gonna preface my answer Steve (101:44 - 101:48)
just took a breath do you want to go (101:46 - 101:50)
first no you go (101:48 - 101:52)
um I'm gonna preface what I say with uh (101:50 - 101:55)
I don't really remember the details of a (101:52 - 101:56)
lot of the past regions and storylines (101:55 - 101:58)
because before sword and shield the most (101:56 - 102:00)
hours I ever put into a Pokemon game was (101:58 - 102:02)
60 because it took me 60 hours to become (102:00 - 102:05)
Champion I would just put it down and (102:02 - 102:06)
never play it again (102:05 - 102:08)
um but based on like a quick Google to (102:06 - 102:10)
refresh my memory (102:08 - 102:12)
um I feel like uh I feel like Unova (102:10 - 102:14)
would be interesting to come back to (102:12 - 102:16)
because it's like based on this this big (102:14 - 102:18)
metropolitan area that is just like (102:16 - 102:20)
naturally going to be evolving and (102:18 - 102:22)
changing very quickly right so it like (102:20 - 102:23)
makes sense for things to be very (102:22 - 102:25)
different when you come back and I think (102:23 - 102:26)
it leaves like a lot of room for (102:25 - 102:27)
exploration and changing things around (102:26 - 102:30)
and also they have like the seasons in (102:27 - 102:32)
that game right so I feel like there's (102:30 - 102:34)
opportunities for like seasonal events (102:32 - 102:36)
um and adding in a lot more content (102:34 - 102:39)
there but like in general I think that (102:36 - 102:42)
for any like remake or sequel for me I (102:39 - 102:44)
think that like just quality of life (102:42 - 102:46)
updates are the thing that I want the (102:44 - 102:48)
most like I don't mind if something is (102:46 - 102:50)
like a faithful remake and like remains (102:48 - 102:52)
faithful if it's like and it can be like (102:50 - 102:54)
really fun and nostalgic to like go back (102:52 - 102:56)
and play the same game but like with all (102:54 - 102:57)
of the new great stuff (102:56 - 102:58)
um (102:57 - 103:00)
that like later generations have (102:58 - 103:01)
introduced which I think a lot of people (103:00 - 103:03)
were hoping bdsp would be and then bdsp (103:01 - 103:04)
was not (103:03 - 103:07)
um yeah (103:04 - 103:07)
there was like bad Marketing in the (103:08 - 103:12)
whole faithful remake of bdsp because (103:10 - 103:14)
they're like it's faithful but we're not (103:12 - 103:16)
going to tell you anything until the (103:14 - 103:18)
game actually comes out and then this (103:16 - 103:20)
part is faithful but this part is not (103:18 - 103:22)
and this part is faithful but if we (103:20 - 103:24)
added a whole underground area which (103:22 - 103:29)
wasn't faithful but beautiful (103:24 - 103:29)
they just made it more yeah (103:31 - 103:36)
yeah it was (103:34 - 103:39)
I like many other people do not want to (103:36 - 103:43)
see the direction of bdsp (103:39 - 103:45)
um but I also was not impressed with (103:43 - 103:47)
like the direction of Omega Ruby Alpha (103:45 - 103:51)
Sapphire like it was okay like and my (103:47 - 103:52)
complaints for Omega Ruby's Alpha (103:51 - 103:54)
Sapphire was like I wish they did even (103:52 - 103:57)
more like I wish they really cranked up (103:54 - 104:00)
like the changes (103:57 - 104:02)
um I (104:00 - 104:06)
like I I guess I I would want (104:02 - 104:11)
a return maybe to Black and White (104:06 - 104:14)
or I would either want black and white (104:11 - 104:16)
or I would want Johto and I think the (104:14 - 104:17)
reason I would want to say Johto is like (104:16 - 104:20)
I want a Johto with alcanto I want to (104:17 - 104:23)
Johto that like feels big (104:20 - 104:25)
um like I think what Johto does well is (104:23 - 104:28)
like the actual towns feel like big like (104:25 - 104:30)
Goldenrod or (104:28 - 104:32)
um gosh what's the town with the burn (104:30 - 104:35)
Tower uh slipping my mind right now ECU (104:32 - 104:37)
Creek yeah like those those towns (104:35 - 104:39)
themselves feel really big and feels (104:37 - 104:41)
like there's a lot to do in them and (104:39 - 104:43)
then the roots are like three steps (104:41 - 104:46)
you're like three like like a hop over (104:43 - 104:48)
to the next town like I'm pretty sure (104:46 - 104:50)
Johto is the smallest map out of (104:48 - 104:53)
everything and it would be great if it (104:50 - 104:55)
wasn't overshadowed by Kanto and you (104:53 - 104:58)
just had like these like just I don't (104:55 - 105:00)
care that the routes were like three (104:58 - 105:02)
steps in the old games give me like (105:00 - 105:04)
these huge vast routes in between towns (105:02 - 105:06)
where it feels like an adventure to get (105:04 - 105:09)
to you know Goldenrod or whatever like I (105:06 - 105:10)
want that kind of (105:09 - 105:13)
I I don't care if gym leaders are the (105:10 - 105:14)
same or different I just want that (105:13 - 105:17)
region to feel very like fulfilled and (105:14 - 105:19)
being able to explore on the flip side (105:17 - 105:21)
with like something like black and white (105:19 - 105:23)
like a faithful remake I would feel (105:21 - 105:27)
would be the same complaints of bdsp (105:23 - 105:29)
because if you remember black and white (105:27 - 105:32)
it had the same ultimate problems as the (105:29 - 105:33)
games prior to it that's why I think X (105:32 - 105:35)
and Y is really good (105:33 - 105:36)
black and white if you go to like route (105:35 - 105:39)
one it's like two Pokemon you got a (105:36 - 105:41)
purloin or you got a p Dev and then you (105:39 - 105:43)
get to rot two and it's like purloin B P (105:41 - 105:47)
dub and uh Venipede like it's this very (105:43 - 105:50)
same problem of like (105:47 - 105:52)
there's not a lot of variety here and (105:50 - 105:53)
that's what I think X and Y did really (105:52 - 105:56)
great in the first route on X and Y is (105:53 - 105:59)
like 10 different Pokemon and the forest (105:56 - 106:00)
the first Forest you get to is like 15 (105:59 - 106:02)
different Pokemon and you're like this (106:00 - 106:05)
is so refreshing compared to like Kanto (106:02 - 106:08)
where it's like you got Caterpie and you (106:05 - 106:10)
got Weedle and maybe like two percent of (106:08 - 106:12)
time you got Pikachu (106:10 - 106:14)
now oh we threw Pidgey in there you (106:12 - 106:17)
missed Pidgey okay sorry he's he's here (106:14 - 106:18)
too (106:17 - 106:19)
um (106:18 - 106:21)
so like yeah if we were to ever go back (106:19 - 106:23)
like I worry (106:21 - 106:26)
with like a black and white remake or a (106:23 - 106:29)
black and white visit that (106:26 - 106:32)
I like I I was not one of the fans that (106:29 - 106:34)
were upset that black and white was all (106:32 - 106:36)
new Pokemon get rid of all the old ones (106:34 - 106:38)
I'm cool with that that was great to me (106:36 - 106:42)
I was a big fan of that but I was not a (106:38 - 106:44)
fan of like this route has three Pokemon (106:42 - 106:47)
that's it this next route has the same (106:44 - 106:50)
three Pokemon but we added one more (106:47 - 106:52)
um I just don't think that works (106:50 - 106:54)
anymore it kind of it kind of worked (106:52 - 106:57)
back then (106:54 - 106:59)
um like I remember being (106:57 - 107:02)
19 18 when those games came out and I (106:59 - 107:03)
was like this is fine (107:02 - 107:06)
uh but I don't think it works anymore it (107:03 - 107:08)
served a purpose back then to be like (107:06 - 107:10)
don't (107:08 - 107:12)
don't Linger on these roots to just try (107:10 - 107:14)
to find (107:12 - 107:16)
each and every one (107:14 - 107:19)
they'll they'll repeat so you can keep (107:16 - 107:22)
progressing to each town because we kind (107:19 - 107:25)
of spread the towns out so for a pacing (107:22 - 107:27)
situation like it helped eliminate the (107:25 - 107:29)
problem of I'm going to keep searching (107:27 - 107:32)
in this area until I find every possible (107:29 - 107:34)
thing and then when I get to the next (107:32 - 107:36)
one I'm gonna waste another 50 minutes (107:34 - 107:37)
trying to find everything in here I was (107:36 - 107:39)
like now you already got a bunch get it (107:37 - 107:42)
move on get it move on like it tried to (107:39 - 107:45)
push the pacing forward in games that (107:42 - 107:47)
had previously been pretty much a (107:45 - 107:50)
terrible slog like let's look at what (107:47 - 107:51)
came before black and white which was (107:50 - 107:53)
there's a there's a bunch of different (107:51 - 107:55)
things but every trainer has Geodude (107:53 - 107:57)
right like (107:55 - 108:00)
it tried to solve that problem of you (107:57 - 108:03)
being forced to stick on a root till you (108:00 - 108:05)
got everything by saying half the things (108:03 - 108:07)
you already got so move on (108:05 - 108:09)
um I don't think that flies in today's (108:07 - 108:11)
game world anymore I don't think that (108:09 - 108:13)
flies in a world where a Serebii exists (108:11 - 108:15)
and tells you you've got a 10 chance of (108:13 - 108:18)
finding this one thing at 6 PM so come (108:15 - 108:20)
back then yeah (108:18 - 108:23)
um so at the time I know I can see why (108:20 - 108:25)
they made that decision but I agree I (108:23 - 108:27)
don't think it works anymore and I think (108:25 - 108:29)
the problem that X and Y has is again I (108:27 - 108:32)
go back to that it had great routes but (108:29 - 108:35)
the pacing was so bizarre of when you (108:32 - 108:37)
would actually run into a town that (108:35 - 108:39)
mattered (108:37 - 108:41)
um and that wasn't just a town that was (108:39 - 108:43)
there (108:41 - 108:46)
yes because you're like why why is this (108:43 - 108:48)
why is this Mansion town here except for (108:46 - 108:52)
me to waste time around to Snorlax (108:48 - 108:52)
and I'm going to this incredibly (108:53 - 108:57)
beautiful palace to watch fireworks once (108:54 - 109:00)
and then I'll never (108:57 - 109:02)
because who cares (109:00 - 109:04)
hey you chased a furfer I think as well (109:02 - 109:08)
yeah that's fun (109:04 - 109:08)
yeah I think I I think that goes back to (109:10 - 109:14)
the problems with bdsp I just think a (109:12 - 109:15)
lot of (109:14 - 109:17)
a lot of what made like again they were (109:15 - 109:19)
like we want to make a faithful game (109:17 - 109:20)
cool (109:19 - 109:22)
the half your game wasn't faithful but (109:20 - 109:24)
okay uh (109:22 - 109:26)
uh but it's like a lot of this stuff (109:24 - 109:29)
just doesn't work today (109:26 - 109:31)
yeah I mean it worked for some people (109:29 - 109:32)
some people were like I love this style (109:31 - 109:36)
of Pokemon game but I mean (109:32 - 109:38)
I don't think you can I think you can (109:36 - 109:40)
get away with it in a remake because (109:38 - 109:42)
you're buying off of this is the way it (109:40 - 109:45)
was if that was a game that came out (109:42 - 109:47)
on its own and it was designed that way (109:45 - 109:50)
I don't think it would have flown and in (109:47 - 109:52)
today's if it wasn't latching on to the (109:50 - 109:54)
fact that this is the way it was and (109:52 - 109:56)
you're remembering how it was and (109:54 - 109:58)
reliving that experience I don't think (109:56 - 110:01)
those games would have done well (109:58 - 110:01)
I'm curious of where we're at though (110:05 - 110:08)
with like (110:07 - 110:10)
gosh it was like all through sword and (110:08 - 110:11)
shields development cycle where people (110:10 - 110:14)
were like we're getting let's go Merrill (110:11 - 110:18)
and let's go Mantine and like (110:14 - 110:21)
or getting that like I mean I I don't (110:18 - 110:23)
know I don't know if (110:21 - 110:25)
you know after scarlet and violet if (110:23 - 110:27)
we're getting Gen 5 if we're getting Gen (110:25 - 110:30)
2 if we're getting gen 1 for the 70th (110:27 - 110:33)
time if we're getting (110:30 - 110:35)

Spain is right next to France and France (110:35 - 110:41)

bunch of genlin Pokemon gen 1 remix (110:43 - 110:47)

week so I think my plan is to try to (111:00 - 111:05)
record the show before I go to twitchcon (111:03 - 111:08)
um so if there is news like on Friday or (111:05 - 111:09)
Saturday and you're like why isn't Steve (111:08 - 111:11)
covering this it's probably because we (111:09 - 111:13)
recorded it on like a Wednesday (111:11 - 111:16)
um but if you're in San Diego the week (111:13 - 111:20)
