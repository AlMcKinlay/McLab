really yeah I was walking down the (0:41 - 0:45)
street and there was this wooden sign (0:44 - 0:47)
and I looked at it and it said stealing (0:45 - 0:48)
other people's pokémon makes you no (0:47 - 0:49)
better than a thief (0:48 - 0:51)
look I don't want to hear what you found (0:49 - 0:53)
in Sun and Moon because you're the only (0:51 - 0:55)
person in the world still playing this (0:53 - 1:01)
game you may be correct no that's not (0:55 - 1:03)
true I know we did all you twos doing a (1:01 - 1:05)
mono ice run we did a Twitter poll (1:03 - 1:07)
there's 20% of people who bought the (1:05 - 1:09)
game are still playing in it it's almost (1:07 - 1:12)
like no one ah Travis is back that's (1:09 - 1:14)
true we're recording this on Father's (1:12 - 1:16)
Day so I want to ask the two of you what (1:14 - 1:18)
you think is the most fatherly Pokemon (1:16 - 1:24)

why you didn't go pro BOPE asks for the (1:26 - 1:30)
full effect but I think very strong (1:28 - 1:32)
answers from both of you thank you all (1:30 - 1:37)
right well welcome this is a Pokemon (1:32 - 1:39)
podcast we have a little bit of Pokemon (1:37 - 1:43)
news III just happened so what maybe (1:39 - 1:46)
we'll we'll spend just a smidgen of time (1:43 - 1:48)
on that then we'll go into our Pokemon (1:46 - 1:51)
news then we have some emails we didn't (1:48 - 1:53)
do emails last week so we will do a (1:51 - 1:55)
couple emails and then we have our (1:53 - 1:57)
Pokemon of the week and that will be the (1:55 - 2:00)
show for you guys today but let's start (1:57 - 2:02)
with III I mean a lot a lot of games (2:00 - 2:05)
were shown I think a lot of our (2:02 - 2:07)
listeners were probably the most excited (2:05 - 2:09)
for the Nintendo Direct or whatever they (2:07 - 2:11)
were calling it I don't think the house (2:09 - 2:15)
of terror yeah three I don't think they (2:11 - 2:16)
used the word direct I just think it was (2:15 - 2:19)
a tree house presentation I'm not it (2:16 - 2:22)
might have been like III digital event (2:19 - 2:24)
or oh yeah yeah something silly (2:22 - 2:27)
besides the Mario and pokken tournament (2:24 - 2:30)
that they in splatoon and arms a little (2:27 - 2:31)
bit of you know they those games are (2:30 - 2:32)
coming out soon (2:31 - 2:34)
Mario Odyssey (2:32 - 2:36)
the big thing they showed which we (2:34 - 2:38)
already know about they did take two (2:36 - 2:42)
seconds and to me it seemed like the (2:38 - 2:45)
announcement of a core Pokemon game (2:42 - 2:48)
coming to switch was kind of shoehorn in (2:45 - 2:52)
there okay we're gonna enter well it (2:48 - 2:54)
felt that way because they couldn't even (2:52 - 2:57)
show us anything from it and even then I (2:54 - 3:00)
forget which person from the Pokemon (2:57 - 3:02)
company was the person that cut too but (3:00 - 3:04)
he was saying something along the lines (3:02 - 3:07)
of we can't show you anything and it (3:04 - 3:10)
won't even be for a few years but hey (3:07 - 3:13)
we're making a core series Pokemon game (3:10 - 3:17)
on the switch so all right back to you (3:13 - 3:20)
that's that's very much like when I'm at (3:17 - 3:21)
work and I have to do like a (3:20 - 3:24)
presentation on how much money we're (3:21 - 3:26)
paying to one of our technology vendors (3:24 - 3:28)
or something and I like only remember (3:26 - 3:30)
that I'm supposed to be doing it be like (3:28 - 3:32)
five minutes before the presentation so (3:30 - 3:35)
I walk in the room and I'm like yeah I'm (3:32 - 3:38)
still crunching the numbers and yeah we (3:35 - 3:43)
send a lot of money to that company for (3:38 - 3:45)
technology services all right (3:43 - 3:47)
you guys have a good day short meeting (3:45 - 3:50)
today goodbye it's what because will and (3:47 - 3:53)
I were talking last week about how (3:50 - 3:56)
controlling Pokemon is with their their (3:53 - 3:58)
message and messages and their marketing (3:56 - 4:04)
and how they say things and this twenty (3:58 - 4:07)
second we're gonna cut to you sitting at (4:04 - 4:10)
your desk you're not even presenting (4:07 - 4:13)
like a Pokemon purse like Pokemon has (4:10 - 4:15)
presented in the past of you standing in (4:13 - 4:17)
front of a carefully crafted wall of (4:15 - 4:20)
Pokemon plushies we're just gonna cut to (4:17 - 4:21)
you at your desk and you're gonna go (4:20 - 4:25)
yeah it's all gets coming guys don't (4:21 - 4:26)
worry about it you get that sort of (4:25 - 4:28)
thing every once in a while and I'm sure (4:26 - 4:29)
it's a function of the fact that the (4:28 - 4:33)
Pokemon company is that strange (4:29 - 4:37)
second-party developer that they are you (4:33 - 4:39)
know I'm sure has something to do with (4:37 - 4:42)
the fact that they're kind of Nintendo (4:39 - 4:45)
and kind of not like it game freak (4:42 - 4:47)
rather I said the Pokemon company but (4:45 - 4:48)
the fact that (4:47 - 4:49)
gamefreak is like a second-party (4:48 - 4:51)
developer and the Pokemon company is (4:49 - 4:54)
like a second party publisher like I'm (4:51 - 4:56)
sure it makes for every once in a while (4:54 - 4:58)
some awkward things like that but yeah I (4:56 - 4:59)
think you're right on the whole that (4:58 - 5:00)
they're very particular with their (4:59 - 5:02)
messaging and you know what I'll (5:00 - 5:04)
actually come back at you guys from the (5:02 - 5:06)
opposite angle because honestly the only (5:04 - 5:09)
visual they gave us was like it's like a (5:06 - 5:12)
black screen with Pokemon game on switch (5:09 - 5:15)
coming 2018 something right right yeah (5:12 - 5:20)
they are so scared of SBJ national (5:15 - 5:24)
treasury every freaking image that comes (5:20 - 5:27)
out of them that they're like no no no (5:24 - 5:28)
you were gonna put a Pikachu on there (5:27 - 5:30)
but if the Pikachu is looking to the (5:28 - 5:32)
left they're gonna say oh diamond and (5:30 - 5:34)
pearl remakes because in Diamond and (5:32 - 5:36)
Pearl the west side of the island was (5:34 - 5:39)
the warm side and obviously that's what (5:36 - 5:41)
pika she was looking towards yeah I mean (5:39 - 5:44)
that makes sense yeah I was gonna say I (5:41 - 5:45)
thought you were gonna say because she (5:44 - 5:47)
was looking to the left therefore it's a (5:45 - 5:52)
look to the past is looking backwards (5:47 - 5:54)
into the past earlier would have a (5:52 - 5:55)
diamond pearl remake and then someone (5:54 - 5:57)
else would be like well actually the (5:55 - 6:00)
directionality of text is different in (5:57 - 6:02)
Japanese so it's not necessarily what (6:00 - 6:04)
that yeah that's right Japanese people (6:02 - 6:06)
would read from right to left so you (6:04 - 6:07)
have to take that into account (6:06 - 6:10)
mm-hmm look I didn't make this podcast (6:07 - 6:13)
last seven years without doing a little (6:10 - 6:18)
speculation we said this last week where (6:13 - 6:21)
maybe I said it I think we'll agreed (6:18 - 6:24)
with me that I can't imagine a another (6:21 - 6:28)
console coming out to replace the 3ds in (6:24 - 6:32)
in any means because of the whole I (6:28 - 6:34)
don't think the market is big enough for (6:32 - 6:38)
a switch to exist and another new (6:34 - 6:41)
handheld just kind of makes sense that (6:38 - 6:43)
Pokemon would eventually move to switch (6:41 - 6:45)
yeah I agree (6:43 - 6:47)
Hey (6:45 - 6:49)
I'm curious to see if they do a thing (6:47 - 6:52)
where it's also released on a dedicated (6:49 - 6:56)
handheld as well as on the switch but at (6:52 - 6:59)
this point it seems unlikely given that (6:56 - 7:02)
as they mentioned the new Pokemon game (6:59 - 7:05)
won't be for a few years and while I (7:02 - 7:09)
know some people disagree to me it makes (7:05 - 7:12)
sense that the switch is a console that (7:09 - 7:15)
is an attempt to consolidate both (7:12 - 7:18)
markets and a replacement for both the (7:15 - 7:21)
console and handheld markets so I doubt (7:18 - 7:23)
that we'll have a successor to the (7:21 - 7:27)
direct successor to the 3ds in that time (7:23 - 7:29)
and it would seem very strange to (7:27 - 7:32)
release a core Pokemon game on the 3ds (7:29 - 7:37)
in two years when that system is all as (7:32 - 7:39)
old as likes in I don't know (7:37 - 7:42)
yeah the 3ds will be seven years come (7:39 - 7:45)
early early next year and I don't even (7:42 - 7:49)
think like the ps3 and the Xbox lasted (7:45 - 7:52)
about seven years xbox360 lasted about (7:49 - 7:54)
seven to eight years before they should (7:52 - 7:58)
before the ps4 and the Xbox one came out (7:54 - 8:00)
now that's not to say they didn't (7:58 - 8:03)
continue releasing games after said (8:00 - 8:06)
consoles came out I I leaned more (8:03 - 8:10)
towards this game coming out not I (8:06 - 8:14)
wouldn't be surprised if we got it next (8:10 - 8:16)
fall I know they said hey we just (8:14 - 8:19)
started working on it but again that (8:16 - 8:23)
seemed that a whole message of we're (8:19 - 8:24)
gonna quickly cut through your desk hey (8:23 - 8:25)
we're working on it we don't have (8:24 - 8:28)
anything to show you by just seem very (8:25 - 8:31)
rushed of okay we just need to say (8:28 - 8:34)
something guys we just need to feel 30 (8:31 - 8:37)
seconds and get switch owners excited (8:34 - 8:38)
because Pokemon is a system seller (8:37 - 8:41)
there's no doubt about it of how many (8:39 - 8:44)
copies they sell so if we if we already (8:41 - 8:46)
have Zelda we have splatoon we have (8:44 - 8:49)
pokken we have arms coming out with (8:46 - 8:51)
Super Mario to see their real message is (8:49 - 8:53)
we want to sell these things for (8:51 - 8:54)
Christmas (8:53 - 8:56)
that is to say if they can they can keep (8:54 - 8:58)
them in if they can stock shelves with (8:56 - 9:00)
them but (8:58 - 9:02)
you have just a few games plus you're (9:00 - 9:05)
putting out your biggest franchise in (9:02 - 9:07)
the world Mario this Christmas and you (9:05 - 9:10)
know Pokemon is coming okay now is the (9:07 - 9:11)
time to pull the trigger because I'm (9:10 - 9:13)
gonna need it eventually so I might as (9:11 - 9:16)
well get it around Mario yep and it (9:13 - 9:17)
makes it very clear that ultra Sun (9:16 - 9:20)
ultramoon are just filler to carry us (9:17 - 9:22)
one more year the only reason why I (9:20 - 9:24)
wouldn't be surprised if it came out (9:22 - 9:27)
November of 2018 I'll even push that to (9:24 - 9:31)
like March of 2019 because sometimes (9:27 - 9:32)
they like to do that early spring (9:31 - 9:35)
release when they when they need a (9:32 - 9:37)
little bit more time with I think both (9:35 - 9:39)
diamond and pearl diamond pearl (9:37 - 9:42)
definitely came out in spring might have (9:39 - 9:44)
been April but anyways I just can't see (9:42 - 9:46)
them taking another year off like to go (9:44 - 9:49)
here's here's ultra Sun ultra moon in (9:46 - 9:53)
November 17th less 364 days after Sun (9:49 - 9:55)
and Moon so it's not really it's not (9:53 - 9:56)
really a new game (9:55 - 9:59)
it's just filler and then we're gonna (9:56 - 10:01)
take a whole another year off yeah that (9:59 - 10:04)
just seems really stretching it that (10:01 - 10:06)
reasoning makes sense to me the I think (10:04 - 10:09)
the only and I should be clear I agree (10:06 - 10:12)
with you but I think it's worth someone (10:09 - 10:14)
saying the other side of the argument (10:12 - 10:16)
which is that it is still a little (10:14 - 10:18)
strange that if it were coming out (10:16 - 10:20)
within a year that they wouldn't even (10:18 - 10:26)
have like a title or some sort of teaser (10:20 - 10:27)
like the original teaser they did for (10:26 - 10:29)
pokken tournament though people are like (10:27 - 10:31)
oh what is that and they don't even say (10:29 - 10:34)
the name of it like some thing but I (10:31 - 10:37)
think like if you think about it in the (10:34 - 10:39)
context of they just announced ultra Sun (10:37 - 10:42)
and ultra moon what was it four days (10:39 - 10:45)
prior to that they probably don't want (10:42 - 10:49)
to model their messaging and confuse (10:45 - 10:51)
people about which games are coming out (10:49 - 10:55)
one so I tend to agree with you yeah (10:51 - 10:57)
even if they are pretty far along and (10:55 - 11:00)
maybe made maybe this goes back to (10:57 - 11:03)
Eurogamer saying they heard saw whatever (11:00 - 11:05)
their original rumor was we we talked (11:03 - 11:08)
about it last week they saw pokemon (11:05 - 11:11)
running on switch whether that was Sun (11:08 - 11:12)
and Moon whether that was a new game (11:11 - 11:13)
whether that was ultra Sun (11:12 - 11:16)
Ultra moon it almost makes it clear that (11:13 - 11:19)
they just didn't think about this two (11:16 - 11:22)
weeks ago hey what do you guys want to (11:19 - 11:24)
do for e3 I guess it's time to move (11:22 - 11:28)
consoles already these days these (11:24 - 11:30)
decisions don't happen overnight but I (11:28 - 11:33)
even you know if they're a year into (11:30 - 11:36)
development of this game or whatnot (11:33 - 11:40)
it doesn't it will maybe hurt ultra Sun (11:36 - 11:42)
and ultra moon if they went up there and (11:40 - 11:44)
they said something because like we'll (11:42 - 11:49)
alluded to earlier myself and many fans (11:44 - 11:52)
would tear that apart of okay is this (11:49 - 11:54)
generation eight is this a remake is (11:52 - 11:57)
this a remake of a remake is this a (11:54 - 11:59)
whole new game is this actually are they (11:57 - 12:01)
actually turning Pokemon Ranger into a (11:59 - 12:03)
core series game and that's what they (12:01 - 12:05)
mean because they're both RPGs a remake (12:03 - 12:08)
of a remake it would be like Pokemon (12:05 - 12:13)
burning fire red and Pokemon nourishing (12:08 - 12:17)
leaf green they just keep adding (12:13 - 12:19)
adjectives and adjectives till it's like (12:17 - 12:23)
Pokemon feels a passion fire burning red (12:19 - 12:26)
that sounds alright I mean when you (12:23 - 12:27)
title your game that ridiculous (12:26 - 12:30)
ridiculously I can't help to buy it at (12:27 - 12:33)
that point the black screen with just (12:30 - 12:34)
the Pokemon logo I think was the safe (12:33 - 12:37)
bet right because then you don't you (12:34 - 12:40)
don't give fans you give fans enough (12:37 - 12:43)
excitement to go okay finally I know (12:40 - 12:45)
that Pokemon is moving to this council (12:43 - 12:47)
it's safe to buy this console and or I (12:45 - 12:49)
already have this console so I feel good (12:47 - 12:52)
that eventually I will get it but you (12:49 - 12:53)
don't give enough information away to (12:52 - 12:56)
going oh they're just they're just (12:53 - 13:01)
remaking Emerald version and I don't (12:56 - 13:03)
care about read I don't care about going (13:01 - 13:05)
back in time that would be such a (13:03 - 13:10)
terrible yeah after they released horas (13:05 - 13:13)
like not they just skip Diamond and (13:10 - 13:15)
Pearl and they just go forever (13:13 - 13:19)
you guys ranted and raved about gen 3 (13:15 - 13:21)
for so long we're gonna double down and (13:19 - 13:25)
we're gonna triple down on Gen 3 we're (13:21 - 13:27)
gonna get you to keep redoing gen 3 (13:25 - 13:29)
till you're sick of it and then you know (13:27 - 13:31)
what we're gonna do it five times more (13:29 - 13:33)
you thought you hated well I was sick of (13:31 - 13:36)
it I was sick I was yeah I was sick of (13:33 - 13:38)
it before they made the remake so I get (13:36 - 13:40)
if they're doing it five more times I (13:38 - 13:43)
guess that's for more remakes to expect (13:40 - 13:46)
it was a cool announcement though it was (13:43 - 13:48)
maybe it's because I am such a big (13:46 - 13:50)
Pokemon fan that I was satisfied with (13:48 - 13:53)
that but it it was funny that their (13:50 - 13:55)
excuse was and we're not gonna show you (13:53 - 13:58)
anything because we only want to show (13:55 - 14:00)
you games coming out this year and (13:58 - 14:03)
here's Metroid Prime four it's not (14:00 - 14:07)
coming out this year and here's a couple (14:03 - 14:09)
other games also not coming out this (14:07 - 14:12)
year I think all of the games for which (14:09 - 14:16)
they showed gameplay were games that (14:12 - 14:19)
were releasing in the year of our Arceus (14:16 - 14:22)
2017 so I think maybe that's what they (14:19 - 14:25)
meant was there any of those games that (14:22 - 14:26)
stood out was let's talk about Nintendo (14:25 - 14:28)
real quick anything else from Nintendo (14:26 - 14:30)
it was thirty minutes they had the (14:28 - 14:32)
treehouse stuff after but anything stood (14:30 - 14:34)
out to you guys (14:32 - 14:38)
video game wise uh once I heard that the (14:34 - 14:40)
thing that I cared about wasn't going to (14:38 - 14:42)
be on Nintendo I ignored III for the (14:40 - 14:44)
rest of the week yep they didn't (14:42 - 14:45)
announce Monster Hunter double-cross (14:44 - 14:47)
Nintendo fans very upset (14:45 - 14:49)
I don't think Nintendo showed anything I (14:47 - 14:51)
was really excited for like Mario (14:49 - 14:53)
Odyssey looks very good it does look (14:51 - 14:53)
good (14:53 - 14:57)
but that wasn't a surprise sure sure (14:53 - 15:01)
yeah I mean I think a lot of people are (14:57 - 15:03)
excited about the prospect of a new (15:01 - 15:06)
Metroid Prime game after what like a (15:03 - 15:09)
decade plus of those games not existing (15:06 - 15:11)
I think a lot of people are excited for (15:09 - 15:14)
that I can't say I've played more than (15:11 - 15:16)
the first Metroid Prime game so um that (15:14 - 15:18)
wasn't me but I think a lot of listeners (15:16 - 15:20)
are probably yelling at their phones (15:18 - 15:22)
saying that did people like Yoshi's (15:20 - 15:25)
woolly world I think people like Yoshi's (15:22 - 15:27)
wooly world so they're excited for a new (15:25 - 15:30)
one of those yeah but everybody's ever (15:27 - 15:32)
everybody's not really driving about (15:30 - 15:35)
arms but thank anybody zi amped about (15:32 - 15:40)
arms that games out yep it came out what (15:35 - 15:41)
we're according to some (15:40 - 15:43)
sunday came out on Friday I guess I'm uh (15:41 - 15:46)
I guess I'm late to releasing the armory (15:43 - 15:49)
and arms fan cast that I'll never do man (15:46 - 15:51)
that's a good name real good name (15:49 - 15:55)
actually ours I'm assuming the arm and (15:51 - 15:58)
Armory would be all caps yes good you (15:55 - 16:01)
got that that probably has some good SEO (15:58 - 16:03)
too (16:01 - 16:03)
it's good (16:03 - 16:09)
iTunes search history I watched hell (16:05 - 16:12)
yeah like I was really hoping for Animal (16:09 - 16:15)
Crossing that was really that was like (16:12 - 16:17)
good two things I wanted out of Nintendo (16:15 - 16:19)
was an animal crossing and a monster (16:17 - 16:21)
hunter they didn't show up monster (16:19 - 16:22)
runner they showed that in another stage (16:21 - 16:26)
and you know to be honest I was more (16:22 - 16:30)
excited that it's coming to PlayStation (16:26 - 16:33)
4 and Xbox more a little more excited (16:30 - 16:35)
for me I'm still going an important (16:33 - 16:36)
double cross I'm switch I'll still get (16:35 - 16:39)
my monster hunter Phil there that's fine (16:36 - 16:42)
the treehouse stuff they that's that's (16:39 - 16:44)
where they showed all the 3ds games I (16:42 - 16:46)
don't think they showed a single 3ds (16:44 - 16:48)
game during the initial 30 minutes (16:46 - 16:51)
that's because the 3ds is dying still (16:48 - 16:53)
very unhappy with the console because of (16:51 - 16:55)
its age no no comment I'm not gonna (16:53 - 16:57)
contribute to your madness and your (16:55 - 16:59)
constants creeds against a perfectly (16:57 - 17:01)
fine console that they're coming out (16:59 - 17:03)
with the 2d SXL over the summer so they (17:01 - 17:05)
haven't completely given up on but go on (17:03 - 17:07)
yeah and you know what they showed for (17:05 - 17:11)
3ds nothing but remakes hey did you like (17:07 - 17:14)
isn't there a new Mario superstars a (17:11 - 17:16)
remake squad it's a remake (17:14 - 17:19)
no never mind ah the only new game they (17:16 - 17:20)
showed was like some sushi game which (17:19 - 17:23)
looks like a free-to-play mobile game (17:20 - 17:25)
but it's a puzzle game looks alright and (17:23 - 17:27)
then they showed another Metroid game (17:25 - 17:29)
they're really doubling down on Metroid (17:27 - 17:32)
they showed a remake of metroid 2 which (17:29 - 17:35)
I believe was the original Gameboy game (17:32 - 17:39)
so that's coming to 3s and didn't show (17:35 - 17:42)
anything of ultra Sun ultra moon but (17:39 - 17:45)
Pokemon has never been up never had a (17:42 - 17:49)
place at e3 so Rogel yeah mmm let's (17:45 - 17:53)
anything anything from Sony well I mean (17:49 - 17:54)
Monster Hunter (17:53 - 17:57)
world looks real good it's it's not out (17:54 - 18:01)
play video games well you want to talk (17:57 - 18:04)
about monster hunter or well I mean it's (18:01 - 18:07)
there's just not a lot of information (18:04 - 18:10)
out there it looks really like the look (18:07 - 18:12)
is cool (18:10 - 18:15)
but you you and I both know that Monster (18:12 - 18:19)
Hunter they make really really cool like (18:15 - 18:23)
movies about the game that don't (18:19 - 18:26)
necessarily reflect the actual gameplay (18:23 - 18:28)
so I haven't seen any actual gameplay (18:26 - 18:31)
yet so I can't I can't say anything I (18:28 - 18:34)
mean it'll it's yes on my TV something I (18:31 - 18:36)
wanted so that's worth getting excited (18:34 - 18:39)
about high res graphics all that stuff (18:36 - 18:41)
it seems like they're keeping enough of (18:39 - 18:44)
the you know traditional Monster Hunter (18:41 - 18:48)
tropes that people will enjoy but you (18:44 - 18:52)
know my sore spot is that you know I was (18:48 - 18:54)
hoping to carry over all the work I've (18:52 - 18:56)
put into Monster Hunter generations into (18:54 - 18:58)
a TV based game and I won't be able to (18:56 - 19:02)
do that so that's all well to be fair (18:58 - 19:03)
they've never allowed any American (19:02 - 19:06)
versions to transfer ever stuff well why (19:03 - 19:08)
did they have to hate on America so much (19:06 - 19:10)
maybe this was their opportunity to not (19:08 - 19:14)
be haters that's true maybe (19:10 - 19:15)
generations those been four years in the (19:14 - 19:18)
making and it's being made by the core (19:15 - 19:22)
team that did master her for you you (19:18 - 19:24)
mean Monster Hunter world yes sorry (19:22 - 19:27)
world yes is being made by the team that (19:24 - 19:30)
made for Monster Hunter 4 they've been (19:27 - 19:32)
doing making world for four years and (19:30 - 19:34)
then another team took over for four (19:32 - 19:37)
ultimate and generations and double (19:34 - 19:43)
cross anything from Microsoft they had (19:37 - 19:45)
the best presentation because they had (19:43 - 19:48)
this voice that kept saying exclusive (19:45 - 19:51)
like over and over and over and it was (19:48 - 19:52)
great and it was like literally the same (19:51 - 19:55)
voice every single time exclusive I (19:52 - 19:57)
watched the entire Microsoft (19:55 - 19:59)
presentation because I couldn't find the (19:57 - 20:03)
Sony presentation and I mean it didn't (19:59 - 20:05)
make me excited to be an Xbox one owner (20:03 - 20:09)
but the we'll see if some of the older (20:05 - 20:11)
titles deserve doing the reverse (20:09 - 20:13)
compatibility project will get me (20:11 - 20:15)
excited when I'll you uh play that (20:13 - 20:18)
fusion frenzy again I don't know what (20:15 - 20:18)
that is (20:18 - 20:20)
wait which which console had the game (20:18 - 20:23)
where it's like the mech suits it's kind (20:20 - 20:25)
of open world and you you have mech (20:23 - 20:27)
suits that you can modify and stuff like (20:25 - 20:29)
was that Sony or was that an Armored (20:27 - 20:32)
Core I don't know I was having my I (20:29 - 20:34)
think you're thinking of new custom Robo (20:32 - 20:37)
for the Gamecube no monster rancher (20:34 - 20:40)
anyways that game looked cool so I know (20:37 - 20:42)
many of our listeners know again though (20:40 - 20:45)
I'm talking about so III I was pretty (20:42 - 20:49)
satisfied with it I mean really the only (20:45 - 20:50)
thing I wanted out of III was Monster (20:49 - 20:52)
Hunter and they gave me Monster Hunter (20:50 - 20:54)
and they gave me a Pokemon eventually (20:52 - 20:57)

gonna go to it so I haven't really been (25:45 - 25:51)
focusing a lot of my energies on (25:47 - 25:54)
thinking about it is it because you're (25:51 - 25:55)
not playing go anymore is it because you (25:54 - 25:57)
hate video games or is it because it's (25:55 - 25:59)
too far away which of the three options (25:57 - 26:04)
is it or option D all of the above it's (25:59 - 26:08)
actually option F because option E is it (26:04 - 26:12)
costs money to travel and then option F (26:08 - 26:18)

a little bit every day or so and I I (26:32 - 26:39)
don't know I don't I'm traveling a lot (26:36 - 26:43)

to watch the old budget the old travel (26:43 - 26:49)
budgets oh yeah yeah I know uh Steve is (26:46 - 26:51)
still playing a lot of Pokemon go (26:49 - 26:53)
because I'm like in the middle of some (26:51 - 26:55)
random activity during my day yesterday (26:53 - 26:57)
and my watch goes off and it's like (26:55 - 27:00)
Steve completed a workout and I'm like (26:57 - 27:04)

I biked six miles yesterday and I (27:20 - 27:25)
thought I did not get a notice for well (27:23 - 27:27)
it was I think it was all part of the (27:25 - 27:29)
because when I start the workout on the (27:27 - 27:32)
watch I don't think he can tell you what (27:29 - 27:33)
the difference between me walking or (27:32 - 27:36)
biking is nor do I pay that much (27:33 - 27:37)

here is from Joshua from Kona vet tri (31:20 - 31:30)
convinced I Rhode Island CoV ent are why (31:25 - 31:34)
ya Coventry is so is Josh on the island (31:30 - 31:37)
or in in the island that's where it gets (31:34 - 31:40)
weird cuz Rhode Island is not an island (31:37 - 31:44)
exactly alright good writes in and says (31:40 - 31:46)
hey guys I just started listening to you (31:44 - 31:48)
last week and I went through the hours (31:46 - 31:50)
of stuff and absolutely loved it (31:48 - 31:52)
I'd like to just run an idea past all of (31:50 - 31:54)
you about a new pokemon game for switch (31:52 - 31:55)
and would love to hear your thoughts on (31:54 - 31:57)
it I don't know if this was before or (31:55 - 32:00)
after e3 so what if the new game was (31:57 - 32:01)
something along the lines of a whole (32:00 - 32:03)
Pokemon world where you could visit and (32:01 - 32:05)
travel throughout every pokemon region (32:03 - 32:07)
this would give hours of gameplay and (32:05 - 32:09)
would allow us to do so much obviously a (32:07 - 32:11)
lot of the game would have to be (32:09 - 32:13)
downloadable add-ons and such would this (32:11 - 32:14)
be something you guys would like to see (32:13 - 32:18)
in a Pokemon game force which I know I'd (32:14 - 32:21)
pay good money to see this and play it (32:18 - 32:22)
well that's all I got (32:21 - 32:25)
have a great week happy hunting Josh (32:22 - 32:29)
well I would say if and this is a will (32:25 - 32:30)
Anderson (32:29 - 32:33)
seal it with wax prediction statement (32:30 - 32:35)
dictum I don't know what word you want (32:33 - 32:38)
to use if they ever come out with a game (32:35 - 32:41)
where it is travel to all of the regions (32:38 - 32:43)
travel to any region that will be the (32:41 - 32:45)
capstone to Pokemon and that would be (32:43 - 32:49)
the end of Pokemon whoa I don't think (32:45 - 32:50)
they would ever do something like this (32:49 - 32:54)
exactly because their world is crumbling (32:50 - 32:57)
save the Pokemon world one last time in (32:54 - 32:59)
every region of poke (32:57 - 33:04)
earth I I would love this I I think it's (32:59 - 33:06)
very unlikely just given how much (33:04 - 33:08)
development time it would take to make (33:06 - 33:11)
every single region because I mean sure (33:08 - 33:14)
the other regions already exist in older (33:11 - 33:16)
games but you still have to do the same (33:14 - 33:18)
process they do for the remakes where (33:16 - 33:23)
you create them in a context of stronger (33:18 - 33:26)
graphical capabilities and that takes (33:23 - 33:29)
just all that would take so long with (33:26 - 33:32)
all of that that said even if it's (33:29 - 33:35)
unrealistic that would be quite (33:32 - 33:37)
incredible and I would enjoy it a lot (33:35 - 33:40)
there are a couple reasons why this (33:37 - 33:44)
would probably never happen I don't one (33:40 - 33:47)
being I don't think the I don't think (33:44 - 33:52)
we'll ever get another game with more (33:47 - 33:55)
than one region based on the fact of my (33:52 - 33:59)
complaint last week that these Pokemon (33:55 - 34:02)
fans keep demanding remakes and this (33:59 - 34:05)
this is part of the problem they are so (34:02 - 34:09)
ready and willing to buy diamond and (34:05 - 34:13)
pearl before even a hint that diamond (34:09 - 34:15)
and pearl remakes would ever exist that (34:13 - 34:18)
they have no reason to ever merge or (34:15 - 34:21)
combine regions in the same game because (34:18 - 34:23)
as we saw with omega ruby and alpha (34:21 - 34:25)
sapphire you just complain long enough (34:23 - 34:27)
and loud enough you'll get your remake (34:25 - 34:30)
and you'll get to go back to it and I (34:27 - 34:34)
think the second reason is I don't know (34:30 - 34:37)
weird is probably not the right word I'm (34:34 - 34:39)
just gonna use it anyways it would be (34:37 - 34:42)
weird where there would be a game that (34:39 - 34:46)
you catch all the Pokemon in agreeing (34:42 - 34:48)
with wills point if you could catch all (34:46 - 34:51)
the Pokemon there then you wouldn't have (34:48 - 34:53)
to branch out to these other games I (34:51 - 34:56)
mean ultimately maybe if it's not a (34:53 - 34:59)
capstone to Pokemon altogether and they (34:56 - 35:00)
never make another Pokemon any game (34:59 - 35:04)
after that it would be the end to this (35:00 - 35:06)
Pokemon planet and we'd start go to a (35:04 - 35:08)
different Pokemon planet where it's like (35:06 - 35:11)
just completely new everything new no no (35:08 - 35:13)
start back at (35:11 - 35:15)
back at number one like don't even clear (35:13 - 35:17)
exact hold the sword and the new pokedex (35:15 - 35:21)
I would I would hmm that seems radical (35:17 - 35:24)
but I would actually beat down with that (35:21 - 35:26)
like we are cool I mean they they say (35:24 - 35:28)
that every time they're like Oh Gen 5 (35:26 - 35:31)
it's a it's a fresh start like we're (35:28 - 35:35)
starting with 151 new Pokemon and you're (35:31 - 35:37)
not gonna say a single one until you (35:35 - 35:39)
beat the I would I would be okay with (35:37 - 35:42)
like closing the book we're starting (35:39 - 35:44)
again although they can't do that (35:42 - 35:47)
because they've already had us buy into (35:44 - 35:49)
Pokemon bank with the promise that we (35:47 - 35:50)
will always get to keep our Pokemon (35:49 - 35:52)
through every single Pokemon game in (35:50 - 35:55)
perpetuity but in a theoretical world (35:52 - 35:57)
where that isn't the case like that (35:55 - 35:59)
would actually be kind of cool and bold (35:57 - 36:02)
is there any franchise in videogame (35:59 - 36:06)
history that was like hey everything (36:02 - 36:07)
we've done up to this point let's all (36:06 - 36:11)
merge it together and then sell you an (36:07 - 36:13)
all-time I like the Final Fantasy (36:11 - 36:17)
fighting games like it wasn't the sky of (36:13 - 36:19)
Final Fantasy we're all where you get (36:17 - 36:20)
your your Cloud Strife fighting your (36:19 - 36:23)
squall Leonhart is that what the city is (36:20 - 36:26)
I don't know is that what did I say (36:23 - 36:28)
Disgaea Final Fantasy I think this guy (36:26 - 36:30)
is a different video game franchise I (36:28 - 36:31)
think you're right I think it's Dissidia (36:30 - 36:34)
I mean I saw a preview for that and I (36:31 - 36:36)
was like wow that looks boring as heck (36:34 - 36:40)
and it probably is isn't there also like (36:36 - 36:45)
a rhythm game a rhythm game hmm a Final (36:40 - 36:49)
Fantasy oh yeah whatever you hope here's (36:45 - 36:51)
the here's the other thing about this (36:49 - 36:53)
ultimate world why don't thinking (36:51 - 36:57)
whatever exists is because if you spend (36:53 - 37:00)
the time to do it and there are so many (36:57 - 37:06)
issues gameplay flow wise of okay if (37:00 - 37:08)
they're supposed to be what's I don't (37:06 - 37:11)
know what's 8 times 7 at this point (37:08 - 37:15)
56 there's 56 gym leaders how are you (37:11 - 37:17)
supposed to balance that with level how (37:15 - 37:19)
are you supposed to balance Pokemon in (37:17 - 37:23)
the wild with level besides all that you (37:19 - 37:25)
know just making the game feel good and (37:23 - 37:27)
compelling throughout that (37:25 - 37:30)
entire world slash zone how do you pitch (37:27 - 37:34)
that to Pokemon fans and more (37:30 - 37:36)
importantly Pokemon I think Pokemon fans (37:34 - 37:38)
want that I think Pokemon fans would eat (37:36 - 37:42)
that up like the idea of a game with (37:38 - 37:47)
such a wide number of places to go and (37:42 - 37:51)
such a extensive single-player journey I (37:47 - 37:53)
think Pokemon fans would eat that up in (37:51 - 37:55)
my opinion the more pressing question is (37:53 - 37:56)
how do you follow that up then because (37:55 - 37:58)
now you're expected to do that every (37:56 - 38:01)
time and I don't think they would really (37:58 - 38:03)
be able to pull that off every time (38:01 - 38:04)
they're at least a game it's like (38:03 - 38:07)
Pokemon eventually evolves into Skyrim (38:04 - 38:10)
and it's like oh ok new DLC with quests (38:07 - 38:13)
and it becomes quest based and like yawn (38:10 - 38:16)
city look if there's anything I know (38:13 - 38:19)
that is we will continue to get Skyrim (38:16 - 38:20)
forever (38:19 - 38:23)
III mine destiny III 2018 (38:20 - 38:25)
be prepared to see more versions of (38:23 - 38:28)
Skyrim but no what I was saying is how (38:25 - 38:29)
do you pitch that to Pokemon fans but (38:28 - 38:31)
more importantly how do you pitch that (38:29 - 38:35)
to non Pokemon fans as if that is a good (38:31 - 38:38)
question as a company I I would assume (38:35 - 38:41)
that Pokemon always wants to top their (38:38 - 38:43)
last game not only in sales but (38:41 - 38:47)
increasing their fan base Sun and Moon (38:43 - 38:51)
is the top of that pillar of okay Sun (38:47 - 38:54)
and Moon has sold more copies than X&Y (38:51 - 38:56)
more copies than black and white more (38:54 - 38:58)
copies than diamond and pearl then (38:56 - 39:00)
they're on the right track to growing (38:58 - 39:03)
that that fanbase if they release a (39:00 - 39:06)
generation 8 is it going to top sun and (39:03 - 39:09)
moon' sales I'm I I would hope so I'm (39:06 - 39:11)
sure they'd gamefreak and the Pokemon (39:09 - 39:15)
company would also hope that but if they (39:11 - 39:17)
show a generation 8 and they show (39:15 - 39:18)
something like this where hey this is (39:17 - 39:21)
all the regions is that going to bring (39:18 - 39:23)
in even more fans I don't really think (39:21 - 39:28)
so especially since just look at like (39:23 - 39:30)
something like Pokemon go players that (39:28 - 39:33)
brought more fans that brought more (39:30 - 39:38)
overall players to the franchise of (39:33 - 39:40)
Pokemon than any (39:38 - 39:44)
of the core main series games have and I (39:40 - 39:47)
think even more so than red and blue and (39:44 - 39:49)
gold and silver which are the two (39:47 - 39:52)
best-selling games in the series but (39:49 - 39:55)
there is a substantial drop off to that (39:52 - 39:57)
and we know with Sun and Moon that (39:55 - 39:59)
there's a substantial drop off to that (39:57 - 40:01)
and those are your hardcore pokemon (39:59 - 40:03)
players I think I don't have the data in (40:01 - 40:05)
front of me so if I'm wrong that's fine (40:03 - 40:09)
but I'm pretty sure less than 20% of (40:05 - 40:11)
people actually continue playing after (40:09 - 40:12)
the main story (40:11 - 40:15)
they beat the leaf or they're done they (40:12 - 40:17)
close they close their DS they move on (40:15 - 40:19)
to a different game you have such a (40:17 - 40:21)
small percentage of players actually (40:19 - 40:23)
trying to complete their pokedex or (40:21 - 40:27)
actually trying to do the endgame stuff (40:23 - 40:31)
whereas the hardcore players that would (40:27 - 40:35)
love that game most of them probably by (40:31 - 40:38)
generation 8 will have close to a living (40:35 - 40:41)
decks if not a complete pokedex so what (40:38 - 40:46)
is the appeal for them battling 56 Gym (40:41 - 40:49)
Leaders and then countless trainers in (40:46 - 40:52)
between and them battling elite for like (40:49 - 40:55)
it just doesn't seem it just seems like (40:52 - 40:57)
a pipe dream with no real direction and (40:55 - 40:59)
I think that's the most important part (40:57 - 41:02)
to that is what is the direction well (40:59 - 41:04)
they could make it's it's like you get (41:02 - 41:06)
special Pokemon by completing certain (41:04 - 41:08)
quests or something like that I mean (41:06 - 41:10)
they can change the format it just goes (41:08 - 41:12)
back to the whole argument of people (41:10 - 41:14)
demanding a Pokemon MMO but I feel like (41:12 - 41:16)
a lot of those people demanding it have (41:14 - 41:18)
never actually played an MMO like the (41:16 - 41:22)
end game to World of Warcraft for the (41:18 - 41:23)
end game - final fantasy xiv or final (41:22 - 41:27)
fantasy xi or EverQuest or I'll even (41:23 - 41:29)
throw destiny in there like the end game (41:27 - 41:32)
- those games are so different than the (41:29 - 41:35)
actual story part that they tell like (41:32 - 41:38)
like the storm blood the new Final (41:35 - 41:41)
Fantasy expansion will have you know 60 (41:38 - 41:43)
to 70 story missions and that will tell (41:41 - 41:45)
you a story just like the Pokemon games (41:43 - 41:47)
do and you will level up throughout that (41:45 - 41:50)
story just like in Pokemon games what (41:47 - 41:53)
the difference is there is a real end (41:50 - 41:54)
game (41:53 - 41:56)
at the end of that where you're riding (41:54 - 41:58)
for loot and you're not there's zero (41:56 - 42:01)
story and you're doing harder and harder (41:58 - 42:04)
challenges and yeah that kind of that (42:01 - 42:06)
sure that kind of exists in Pokemon (42:04 - 42:07)
where you're catching pokémon you're (42:06 - 42:09)
you're fighting harder and harder gimli (42:07 - 42:13)
battle tree people or just trainers in (42:09 - 42:15)
general but you're doing all that solo (42:13 - 42:17)
you're never doing that with people so (42:15 - 42:19)
that doesn't make sense in an MMO aspect (42:17 - 42:22)
where you're trying to be you you're in (42:19 - 42:24)
something like Final Fantasy or Warcraft (42:22 - 42:26)
you're doing like these 24 man group (42:24 - 42:30)
raids or 60 man raids or whatnot and (42:26 - 42:32)
Pokemon there's never anything like that (42:30 - 42:36)
not with that attitude I was exactly (42:32 - 42:37)
gonna say look we're gonna take the (42:36 - 42:39)
battle royale but instead of one verse (42:37 - 42:43)
one verse one we're gonna do one verse (42:39 - 42:45)
one verse one verse one verse a hundred (42:43 - 42:49)
and we're going to stream it live I like (42:45 - 42:50)
that though you're gonna think outside (42:49 - 42:53)
of the box dude yeah and outside of the (42:50 - 42:56)
bun excuse me isn't that the Taco Bell (42:53 - 43:00)
thing maybe cuz that one a 80s or 90s (42:56 - 43:02)
drop the chalupa hmm what do they now (43:00 - 43:06)
live mas grande I think it's just live (43:02 - 43:12)
mas yeah he used it used to be think (43:06 - 43:14)
outside the bun I mean that's a pretty (43:12 - 43:20)
good thing it is yeah no one's debating (43:14 - 43:22)
with Taco Bell's marketing team yeah (43:20 - 43:24)
here's the debate Popeyes is the best (43:22 - 43:25)
fried chicken (43:24 - 43:27)
now you can shut your mouth KFC is (43:25 - 43:30)
pretty good Mike writes in title that (43:27 - 43:37)
why we need a diamond apple remake 24 (43:30 - 43:42)
theses on why yeah he's gonna nail it to (43:37 - 43:45)
the daughter of the Cathedral the reason (43:42 - 43:47)
why is because pokemon mystery dungeon (43:45 - 43:51)
teased dark slash primal diet I can't do (43:47 - 43:58)
it Dialga dialga yes boss and still have (43:51 - 44:02)
yet to provide also we could use (43:58 - 44:05)
improved versions of those awful (44:02 - 44:08)
generation 5 starters they are the worst (44:05 - 44:11)
charters and superior is only Salvage by (44:08 - 44:12)
its hidden ability there are other (44:11 - 44:15)
Pokemon that could use mega forms also (44:12 - 44:17)
you should do a podcast series for (44:15 - 44:20)
postgame Sun and Moon do you think the (44:17 - 44:23)
new Pokemon in ultra Sun and ultramoon (44:20 - 44:25)
our forms of soul Galia and loon Allah (44:23 - 44:29)
or necrosha also would you like break to (44:25 - 44:33)
replace mega there's like so much going (44:29 - 44:37)
on and evil it's a it's a flavor (44:33 - 44:40)
adventure yeah all right let's start (44:37 - 44:43)
backwards break is the mechanic they use (44:40 - 44:46)
in the TCG but it's the same thing as Z (44:43 - 44:49)
moves isn't it ya know might one time (44:46 - 44:52)
and nothing should replace anything (44:49 - 44:55)
let's go let's make that clear mega is (44:52 - 44:59)
fine it's cool it exists I hope it (44:55 - 45:00)
continues to exist (44:59 - 45:03)
knowing Pokemon and their ways they're (45:00 - 45:07)
very stubborn when it comes to changing (45:03 - 45:10)
things you can look at arc arcanine as (45:07 - 45:11)
example it is known as the legendary (45:10 - 45:14)
Pokemon it is not legendary I think they (45:11 - 45:16)
should change that but they won't and (45:14 - 45:19)
that's v working backwards again do you (45:16 - 45:21)
think Pokemon do you think the new (45:19 - 45:23)
Pokemon in ultra Sun and ultramoon are (45:21 - 45:25)
the forms of soul Gallio and lalala (45:23 - 45:27)
orna KRAS ma I'll let will handle that (45:25 - 45:30)
they're fusions of Nick rasma and so (45:27 - 45:33)
Galle oh and Nick rasma and Lu Nala (45:30 - 45:37)
that's it's the same thing as black (45:33 - 45:39)
theorem and white Kira might get those (45:37 - 45:42)
vibes yep except that they're (45:39 - 45:44)
symmetrical they're not asymmetrical I'm (45:42 - 45:46)
sure there will be a new gimmick to go (45:44 - 45:47)
with that (45:46 - 45:49)
so it's slightly different than yeah (45:47 - 45:51)
yeah I wouldn't here yeah it probably (45:49 - 45:53)
won't be exactly like it I agree yeah (45:51 - 45:56)
new Pokemon is there any Pokemon that (45:53 - 46:01)
that exists that we don't have in Sun (45:56 - 46:05)
and Moon currently besides marsh shadow (46:01 - 46:09)
document that exists yeah can't get into (46:05 - 46:12)
Pokemon Sun and Moon right like you know (46:09 - 46:14)
how we knew about Volcarona or not well (46:12 - 46:17)
not Volcarona haini haini on 4 you know (46:14 - 46:20)
14 months before it actually (46:17 - 46:23)
listed I do not believe data miners have (46:20 - 46:26)
well as I'm halfway through that (46:23 - 46:29)
statement I believe people have found (46:26 - 46:32)
spaces where except that was on a (46:29 - 46:36)
website not in the actual data of the of (46:32 - 46:38)
the game the only thing I could think of (46:36 - 46:41)
was the McGee onna that looked like a (46:38 - 46:45)
pokeball instead of being all grey yeah (46:41 - 46:47)
that's a form change (46:45 - 46:49)
yeah but they consider new forms new (46:47 - 46:54)
Pokemon I think in ultra Sun ultra moon (46:49 - 46:56)
I mean since we haven't had an (46:54 - 46:58)
opportunity today my data mine that I (46:56 - 47:00)
think we need to get that demo rip it (46:58 - 47:02)
apart and see what's going on inside (47:00 - 47:05)
before we actually can say anything (47:02 - 47:07)
about that so if we've got my prediction (47:05 - 47:13)
pure prediction prior to ultra Sun el (47:07 - 47:16)
tribunal Anderson we are going to get a (47:13 - 47:19)
variation on mimic you where it can wear (47:16 - 47:21)
different costumes and the different (47:19 - 47:23)
costume changes its secondary type (47:21 - 47:25)
memory type I don't remember which (47:23 - 47:27)
that's less that's some good speculation (47:25 - 47:29)
my guess would be there would be three (47:27 - 47:32)
to four new ultra beast oh yeah like (47:29 - 47:36)
that's a gimme yeah I'd agree I mean you (47:32 - 47:38)
got ultra in the title Travis address (47:36 - 47:41)
the concern of all full generation five (47:38 - 47:45)
starters I don't know I like I like John (47:41 - 47:49)
five I like Oshawott I like Snivy who (47:45 - 47:51)
doesn't like asha wat what is wrong if (47:49 - 47:54)
you don't like asha wat go talk to a (47:51 - 47:56)
doctor because there's something (47:54 - 47:58)
medically wrong if you're a hatred of (47:56 - 48:00)
Oshawott lasts for more than three hours (47:58 - 48:01)
please contact a medical professional (48:00 - 48:03)
yes exactly (48:01 - 48:05)
uh and then going back to the first (48:03 - 48:08)
statement mystery dungeon teased a dark (48:05 - 48:11)
and primal alga so that that's (48:08 - 48:14)
confirmation right guys no I think (48:11 - 48:16)
that's just a thing that was in the one (48:14 - 48:18)
game yeah I don't think the mystery (48:16 - 48:20)
dungeon games are canon what about (48:18 - 48:22)
shadow lugia from Gale of darkness I (48:20 - 48:26)
mean I'm I'm waiting I'm waiting on it (48:22 - 48:28)
for sure that's no that's it's yeah it's (48:26 - 48:30)
it's exactly like that it's just like (48:28 - 48:31)
sometimes side games have alternate (48:30 - 48:33)
forms of Pokemon that exist in the main (48:31 - 48:34)
series games (48:33 - 48:37)
then do not reappear in the main series (48:34 - 48:40)
yeah I think gala darkness is a really (48:37 - 48:42)
good game to look to shadow lugia didn't (48:40 - 48:45)
exist outside of that I think it's cool (48:42 - 48:47)
that you can look back at yellow (48:45 - 48:49)
darkness and go yeah shadow lugia is a (48:47 - 48:52)
cool pokemon is it possible they bring (48:49 - 48:54)
it to a future Pokemon game sure but (48:52 - 48:55)
they have had over a decade to do so and (48:54 - 48:56)
they have not (48:55 - 48:58)
I think another good pokemon to look at (48:56 - 49:02)
is is it is it shadow Mewtwo in pokken (48:58 - 49:04)
tournament that is correct (49:02 - 49:06)
yeah that's another good Pokemon to look (49:04 - 49:09)
- and when Namco Bandai talked about (49:06 - 49:11)
actually creating that Pokemon because (49:09 - 49:13)
they were the ones to do so they said (49:11 - 49:14)
they worked very closely with Game Freak (49:13 - 49:17)
because they did not want to or maybe it (49:14 - 49:19)
was creatures I can't remember which (49:17 - 49:22)
people actually make the Pokemon they (49:19 - 49:23)
worked really closely because they (49:22 - 49:27)
didn't want it to seem like an unnatural (49:23 - 49:29)
fit in the Pokemon universe with that (49:27 - 49:31)
being said there's no plans or there was (49:29 - 49:33)
never any discussion of shadow Mewtwo (49:31 - 49:36)
actually moving to a core Pokemon game (49:33 - 49:38)
and I think that's fine I think that (49:36 - 49:40)
that Pokemon exists in that space and (49:38 - 49:43)
that's totally okay just like Santa hat (49:40 - 49:45)
Pikachu exists in Pokemon go and that's (49:43 - 49:47)
totally okay I think where it gets (49:45 - 49:50)
confusing is the fact that primal was (49:47 - 49:53)
then an adjective that got used in the (49:50 - 49:55)
core series with primal Groudon and (49:53 - 49:58)
primal Kyogre and so it seems like well (49:55 - 50:00)
if primal die all go was the thing in a (49:58 - 50:02)
side game like why isn't it but I think (50:00 - 50:03)
it's just a matter of they used the same (50:02 - 50:05)
word twice for two kind of different (50:03 - 50:07)
things because primal Dialga in its (50:05 - 50:10)
depiction pokemon mystery dungeon is (50:07 - 50:13)
quite a different thing it's just that (50:10 - 50:15)
happens to use the same word at least in (50:13 - 50:17)
my opinion is diamond and pearl gonna (50:15 - 50:19)
get remade they may where they've remade (50:17 - 50:21)
everything up to this point (50:19 - 50:23)
yeah maybe probably I'm not gonna ask (50:21 - 50:26)
for it but if they deliver it sure fine (50:23 - 50:28)
because all that all that's going to (50:26 - 50:29)
happen is after a diamond pearl get (50:28 - 50:31)
remade people are gonna demand a remake (50:29 - 50:33)
for black and white it's an ongoing (50:31 - 50:36)
cycle personally I would rather have new (50:33 - 50:39)
games and new concepts over remakes but (50:36 - 50:41)
if the remakes are what's filling in the (50:39 - 50:42)
gaps sure fine (50:41 - 50:44)
but I don't think there has ever been (50:42 - 50:48)
anything substantial (50:44 - 50:52)
to confirm that we are getting diamond (50:48 - 50:55)
and pearl remakes I mean you can look in (50:52 - 50:58)
games and so a Sun and Moon Lily goes to (50:55 - 51:00)
Kanto that Kanto remakes confirmed or in (50:58 - 51:02)
Sun and Moon there was a lot of talk (51:00 - 51:06)
about fossils and fossils existed over (51:02 - 51:08)
it's just speculation at that point and (51:06 - 51:09)
and there's nothing wrong with (51:08 - 51:11)
speculation we do this all the time on (51:09 - 51:13)
the show that's we got to talk about (51:11 - 51:15)
something every week so that's really (51:13 - 51:17)
fine I don't know if mystery dungeon (51:15 - 51:20)
though is the best to look to towards (51:17 - 51:21)
confirmation and pretty banks (51:20 - 51:25)
agreed so what I was gonna say is when (51:21 - 51:26)
you're in your car and you want to turn (51:25 - 51:28)
up the volume on the radio what do you (51:26 - 51:32)
turn the dial not you you're you trying (51:28 - 51:35)
to get me to say valium no whether you (51:32 - 51:38)
turn what is the thing on that your (51:35 - 51:41)
dashboard the dial or the knob dial got (51:38 - 51:41)
dial (51:41 - 51:45)
guhh maybe you get oh yeah you can get (51:41 - 51:46)
it you can do it (51:45 - 51:49)
Colin writes in from Wichita Falls Texas (51:46 - 51:51)
hey guys big fan of the show and I just (51:49 - 51:53)
wanted to comment that neither me nor my (51:51 - 51:55)
friends have seen any leg while plant (51:53 - 51:58)
playing Sun and Moon s PJ and Travis are (51:55 - 52:01)
the only people I've ever heard of (51:58 - 52:03)
having leg on the new 3ds I do not use (52:01 - 52:05)
the new 3ds if you listen to our set of (52:03 - 52:07)
Moon specials Myka and Irene also (52:05 - 52:10)
complain about this but going in unless (52:07 - 52:12)
they skip those episodes firstly we (52:10 - 52:14)
don't have a lot installed on the 3ds (52:12 - 52:17)
could that be the reason we have not (52:14 - 52:19)
noticed leg I believe Sun and Moon works (52:17 - 52:21)
fine in the nude 3ds as long as you have (52:19 - 52:23)
plenty of open memory what are your all (52:21 - 52:25)
thoughts will and Travis are both my (52:23 - 52:30)
favorites Colin so I will add in league (52:25 - 52:32)
with the listener I will say I did not (52:30 - 52:35)
notice lag until I started looking for (52:32 - 52:38)
it it's not like one thing if you play (52:35 - 52:41)
Sun and Moon on an original original 3ds (52:38 - 52:45)
switch I have one that is painful there (52:41 - 52:48)
are like literally black screens while (52:45 - 52:50)
you wait for things to load (52:48 - 52:53)
that's real painful but look while (52:50 - 52:56)
you're in a battle for the opposing (52:53 - 53:00)
Pokemon - like it's sort of (52:56 - 53:01)
it does while it's waiting for you to (53:00 - 53:03)
select a move alright if you're really (53:01 - 53:04)
quick and selecting a move and (53:03 - 53:06)
everything like that you're not gonna (53:04 - 53:07)
see it but if you pay attention while (53:06 - 53:09)
what the other pokemon is doing while (53:07 - 53:12)
you are selected wait not selecting a (53:09 - 53:13)
move but just like kind of looking at it (53:12 - 53:15)
well it's like what are you gonna do um (53:13 - 53:18)
you'll notice it slows down that pokemon (53:15 - 53:19)
is not moving (53:18 - 53:21)
perhaps lag is the incorrect term when (53:19 - 53:24)
we're referring to a drop in the frame (53:21 - 53:27)
rate but um that is what you get from (53:24 - 53:29)
what I know not from what I know from (53:27 - 53:32)
what I have heard having a full SD card (53:29 - 53:37)
as I did does have the negative effect (53:32 - 53:39)
under games frame rate also I would (53:37 - 53:44)
guess the brand of brand of SSD card (53:39 - 53:48)
matters - right and the S and the reason (53:44 - 53:49)
that brand matters is because you have (53:48 - 53:52)
different speed classes of SD cards so (53:49 - 53:54)
maybe I had a slower one and I was (53:52 - 53:56)
running the game off of it but also like (53:54 - 53:58)
out of the three of us sorry to stop you (53:56 - 54:00)
Travis out of the three of us did we all (53:58 - 54:02)
get it digitally or did some or do any (54:00 - 54:04)
of you have cartridge-based (54:02 - 54:06)
I have cartridge-based son did you (54:04 - 54:08)
notice a difference between the (54:06 - 54:11)
cartridge and the SD card but once again (54:08 - 54:17)
I don't I don't look right so no not yet (54:11 - 54:18)
at least (54:17 - 54:20)
Travis you're my only hope it digitally (54:18 - 54:23)
okay you can continue your thought I (54:20 - 54:25)
probably I don't if I think I was (54:23 - 54:26)
basically I think I was basically done (54:25 - 54:29)
just that having a full SD card makes it (54:26 - 54:33)
slow I was running on an original 3ds I (54:29 - 54:36)
am certain I'm not the only one on the (54:33 - 54:38)
internet talking about framerate drops (54:36 - 54:41)
in battles especially during Z moves or (54:38 - 54:43)
battles involving more than two Pokemon (54:41 - 54:46)
that's a pretty well-documented (54:43 - 54:48)
phenomenon well well said yeah it's it's (54:46 - 54:49)
pretty well documented (54:48 - 54:53)
did I I first noticed it when Irene (54:49 - 54:56)
started the game because I was already (54:53 - 54:58)
an hour or two in and I wanted to I (54:56 - 55:00)
wanted to be there when she had her (54:58 - 55:01)
initial thoughts and impressions (55:00 - 55:03)
starting up the game because I knew that (55:01 - 55:05)
it was very cutscene heavy and all these (55:03 - 55:06)
characters were getting introduced and I (55:05 - 55:09)
just couldn't believe how long it took (55:06 - 55:12)
between cutscenes to load while I say (55:09 - 55:13)
leg (55:12 - 55:16)
referring to the frame wrap frame rate (55:13 - 55:20)
dropping and she noticed too she noticed (55:16 - 55:21)
it to the point where she was like this (55:20 - 55:23)
is unplayable we upgraded her to a new (55:21 - 55:27)
3ds of FF a week later because she did (55:23 - 55:30)
really unplayable it's not in true I (55:27 - 55:33)
mean like those complaints I think are (55:30 - 55:35)
valid it's yeah yeah I just heard (55:33 - 55:38)
something basically said a meme so I had (55:35 - 55:40)
to make fun of you for errantly saying a (55:38 - 55:43)
meme it's funny because our Travis your (55:40 - 55:45)
complaints and my complaints about (55:43 - 55:49)
Magikarp jump is the menus take too long (55:45 - 55:53)
to load yeah yeah and I have a new 3ds I (55:49 - 55:55)
have plenty of space on my SD card I (55:53 - 55:57)
have the you know quote-unquote BES SD (55:55 - 55:59)
card you can buy for the 3ds and I still (55:57 - 56:01)
noticed it now did I notice it as much (55:59 - 56:03)
as somebody playing on our original 3ds (56:01 - 56:04)
no of course not (56:03 - 56:06)
the new 3ds does have a better processor (56:04 - 56:09)
things run better but any time an ultra (56:06 - 56:12)
beast battle happened or any time a (56:09 - 56:16)
Pokemon like top lele did something like (56:12 - 56:19)
misty surge which i think is what it (56:16 - 56:23)
does i know a very easy to point it out (56:19 - 56:25)
there doesn't any of this matter (56:23 - 56:28)
no I'm not really anymore are they gonna (56:25 - 56:29)
fix it no Tristana ultramoon yeah (56:28 - 56:33)
probably not yeah oh really doubtful (56:29 - 56:38)
yeah ah message here from bog bars that (56:33 - 56:41)
sounds like a rejected name for a bounty (56:38 - 56:44)
hunter in Star Wars I hope that's not (56:41 - 56:47)
someone's real name it's bog bars bog (56:44 - 56:49)
bars so probably not probably not (56:47 - 56:54)
legally doesn't sound like dengar charge (56:49 - 56:56)
I couldn't couldn't you see him right (56:54 - 56:58)
now there next to couldn't you see bagua (56:56 - 57:01)
right there next to I G 88 and dengar (56:58 - 57:04)
and whatever the lizard dudes name is it (57:01 - 57:05)
sounds like a Mass Effect character (57:04 - 57:08)
message the legends is basically Mass (57:05 - 57:11)
Effect messages all praised well the (57:08 - 57:15)
widest the wisest and goodness I'll take (57:11 - 57:15)
it (57:15 - 57:17)
tell me what you can get Johnny writes (57:15 - 57:21)
in from Auckland New Zealand I was in (57:17 - 57:26)
Australia oh sorry (57:21 - 57:29)
a plan to New Zealand writes in and says (57:26 - 57:38)
to Pokemon bleed um yeah you it's funny (57:29 - 57:40)
cuz Johnny this question was in slack (57:38 - 57:43)
and I said yeah of course Pokemon bleed (57:40 - 57:45)
remember they it happens in the very (57:43 - 57:48)
first Pokemon anime episode when the (57:45 - 57:51)
Spiro attack Ash and Pikachu and then (57:48 - 57:55)
but doesn't be a rush scratched yeah my (57:51 - 57:58)
clearly it was more violent in my head (57:55 - 58:01)
and it was yeah in real life I just I (57:58 - 58:03)
thought I didn't think he was bleeding (58:01 - 58:05)
but I thought this like the scratches (58:03 - 58:07)
and scuffs also had like a red behind (58:05 - 58:13)
them but I used more dirty than anything (58:07 - 58:14)
Pikachu (58:13 - 58:18)
it depends on the Canon you're looking (58:14 - 58:20)
at in the Canon of the manga I believe (58:18 - 58:20)
they do (58:20 - 58:24)
because like Pokemon I'm wrong as very (58:20 - 58:27)
is very is very violent yes but I do not (58:24 - 58:28)
believe they do in any of the quarter (58:27 - 58:32)
series or how they ever have they ever (58:28 - 58:36)
referenced blood or anything in in the (58:32 - 58:39)
in the sense of like working in the lab (58:36 - 58:43)
and having like genetics or anything (58:39 - 58:45)
medically related has has that word even (58:43 - 58:48)
been said well I mean they have the (58:45 - 58:50)
reference genetics obviously because (58:48 - 58:53)
they have the DNA splicers but I think (58:50 - 58:54)
what Steve is asking is in those (58:53 - 58:56)
references to genetics do they have a (58:54 - 58:59)
reference specifically the sanguine (58:56 - 59:02)
fluid right of like oh like pokemon (58:59 - 59:04)
blood like you walk up to a test tube (59:02 - 59:06)
and click on it and it sounds like (59:04 - 59:09)
Pokemon it wouldn't say Pokemon blood (59:06 - 59:11)
but just in all the dialogue all the (59:09 - 59:14)
splicing all the scientists that are in (59:11 - 59:15)
the game that are really bad trainers (59:14 - 59:19)
has just the word ever been said I don't (59:15 - 59:23)
think so one would assume that Pokemon (59:19 - 59:25)
have blood to make them live because (59:23 - 59:28)
they have hearts right why do they have (59:25 - 59:30)
hearts cuz all creatures have our hearts (59:28 - 59:33)
right that's what pumps the blood not (59:30 - 59:36)
every living thing has a heart at plants (59:33 - 59:37)
don't have hearts single-celled (59:36 - 59:40)
organisms don't have hearts a lot of (59:37 - 59:40)
doin (59:40 - 59:44)
two Brits have hearts all of them is an (59:40 - 59:50)
octopus an invertebrate yes which is (59:44 - 59:52)
terrible at biology back to them with us (59:50 - 59:55)
well get a biologist on next week no we (59:52 - 59:56)

longtime listener first-time writer I (60:45 - 60:49)
listened to the podcast just about all (60:47 - 60:52)
day long at work and by far it's super (60:49 - 60:55)
effective is the best said that sends (60:52 - 60:58)
it's weird but you get the gist I have (60:55 - 60:59)
taken a break from playing pokemon for (60:58 - 61:01)
some time now I really enjoyed playing (60:59 - 61:03)
Sunday moon with it I really enjoyed (61:01 - 61:06)
playing Pokemon Sun but came to a point (61:03 - 61:08)
in the game where I just had little (61:06 - 61:11)
desire to go back into it probably the (61:08 - 61:13)
3ds my assumption I also had the same (61:11 - 61:15)
problem with Final Fantasy 7 I know it's (61:13 - 61:16)
a great game but I can't push myself (61:15 - 61:18)
past certain parts in these games that (61:16 - 61:20)
are less exciting have you ever (61:18 - 61:23)
experienced this feeling with Pokemon or (61:20 - 61:25)
any other game series you love if so did (61:23 - 61:28)
you push back the quote boring part and (61:25 - 61:30)
if you did how did you get yourself past (61:28 - 61:32)
that part to enjoy the rest of the game (61:30 - 61:35)
also pick a number between one through a (61:32 - 61:37)
hundred and the one who guesses closest (61:35 - 61:40)
to the number I am thinking of is my (61:37 - 61:42)
favorite host on the podcast thanks for (61:40 - 61:44)
the time you put into the podcast a fan (61:42 - 61:47)
of the show Daniel I hit a wall during (61:44 - 61:51)
my playthrough of Pocket Monsters white (61:47 - 61:53)
2 version (61:51 - 61:55)
but then I had to finish it because I'm (61:53 - 61:57)
on a podcast where I'm supposed to know (61:55 - 62:01)
the things about a Pokemon game to be (61:57 - 62:02)
able to talk about them so I finished it (62:01 - 62:07)
out of a sense of duty to my people and (62:02 - 62:11)
my listeners what was the other question (62:07 - 62:13)
there's another one before the number (62:11 - 62:17)
one any games any games in a series or (62:13 - 62:20)
any in just any game that was boring (62:17 - 62:21)
that you felt you had to push yourself (62:20 - 62:26)
past to enjoy the rest of the game hmm (62:21 - 62:30)
game yeah Chrono Trigger is it's up (62:26 - 62:33)
there in terms of what my favorite game (62:30 - 62:35)
is Chrono Trigger is one of them there (62:33 - 62:39)
are worlds and crit like you fought the (62:35 - 62:43)
distant future the not the like end of (62:39 - 62:46)
time future but they but the (62:43 - 62:49)
post-apocalypse future something about (62:46 - 62:51)
the grime enos of it and how much of it (62:49 - 62:54)
is dungeon crawling I never find myself (62:51 - 62:56)
enjoying it and the fact that it's like (62:54 - 62:58)
the second time period of the game (62:56 - 63:02)
always makes it a bit of a slog but I (62:58 - 63:04)
really loved the rest of the game so I (63:02 - 63:06)
always have to push through that but I (63:04 - 63:08)
just know how much I like that game and (63:06 - 63:10)
how much I like its music so I always (63:08 - 63:13)
find a way to break on through to the (63:10 - 63:15)
other side I'm trying to think of a game (63:13 - 63:19)
but I Magikarp just oh boy you didn't (63:15 - 63:22)
hear me okay about that when we were on (63:19 - 63:24)
break well you know I did what you asked (63:22 - 63:28)
me to I I did play it every day for the (63:24 - 63:31)
past week and wow that has just cemented (63:28 - 63:35)
my hatred of that game so much so yeah (63:31 - 63:38)
is what you give it up on it I mean I'm (63:35 - 63:39)
not telling you you need to play it I'm (63:38 - 63:42)
just curious well to town I feel like it (63:39 - 63:43)
I just felt like it was a game that fit (63:42 - 63:45)
into your routine and I was I was (63:43 - 63:49)
curious about the between like why it (63:45 - 63:51)
wasn't hitting some trigger point that (63:49 - 63:55)
these other mobile ish Pokemon games do (63:51 - 63:57)
because there's no pleasure in it at all (63:55 - 64:00)
and you know using the word routine is (63:57 - 64:04)
like so appropriate because this is what (64:00 - 64:05)
I was telling Travis I was like to me (64:04 - 64:07)
playing Magikarp jump (64:05 - 64:09)
is like being a little kid and your mom (64:07 - 64:12)
says oh we have to go to the bank and so (64:09 - 64:14)
you get in the car and you're sitting in (64:12 - 64:17)
the car driving to the bank and then you (64:14 - 64:19)
go to the bank with your mom and you're (64:17 - 64:21)
there at the bank and she's doing bank (64:19 - 64:23)
stuff too Ching all right something (64:21 - 64:25)
happened then you get back in the car (64:23 - 64:26)
and you go home and that's about as (64:25 - 64:28)
exciting as magikarp job gets for me (64:26 - 64:30)
right sometimes you need a sucker at the (64:28 - 64:33)
bank I didn't know what banks you went (64:30 - 64:35)
to but in New York there were no (64:33 - 64:39)
lollipops yeah no it's it's a loading (64:35 - 64:41)
screen I tap something I either succeed (64:39 - 64:43)
or fail and then it's another loading (64:41 - 64:46)
screen and it's the same cutscene I've (64:43 - 64:49)
seen five hundred times and it's so (64:46 - 64:53)
boring I know nomal it let's take a look (64:49 - 64:54)
let's take a left turn Travis used to (64:53 - 64:56)
play magic rope jump much to my own (64:54 - 64:59)
Trigorin given that I've basically done (64:56 - 65:01)
all of it that like I enjoyed it as I (64:59 - 65:03)
mentioned in the first episode of the (65:01 - 65:05)
podcast after it came out that I enjoyed (65:03 - 65:09)
playing it at first now I keep playing (65:05 - 65:14)
it out of like the zombie of the fun (65:09 - 65:16)
that I had before I'm not really (65:14 - 65:19)
enjoying it anymore it's it because it's (65:16 - 65:24)
by its nature incredibly repetitive yeah (65:19 - 65:26)
I still play it once or twice today (65:24 - 65:30)
going back to Daniels question is there (65:26 - 65:33)
a game games that you just can't push (65:30 - 65:36)
back because you know they're boring or (65:33 - 65:38)
they're rough or whatnot (65:36 - 65:43)
oh yeah um like literally every 3d Zelda (65:38 - 65:44)
with the exception of breath of the wild (65:43 - 65:46)
that's that's the main reason that I (65:44 - 65:50)
don't like Zelda games is because 3ds (65:46 - 65:52)
all the games specifically because when (65:50 - 65:54)
they get to the point where I'm (65:52 - 65:56)
frustrated it's like it's it feels like (65:54 - 65:59)
the level is designed to make me hate (65:56 - 66:03)
every minute I'm spending in it making (65:59 - 66:05)
me like restart areas if I make a slight (66:03 - 66:08)
mistake or puzzles that make no (66:05 - 66:11)
intuitive sense or things like that and (66:08 - 66:13)
then I give up and I look I've barely (66:11 - 66:15)
made a dent in this game and I won't (66:13 - 66:17)
push past it but breath of the wild is (66:15 - 66:20)
much better at that virtually every (66:17 - 66:21)
through every two (66:20 - 66:23)
all the game I've played I actually have (66:21 - 66:25)
enjoyed but don't please forget that so (66:23 - 66:27)
I can continue the bit that I do on the (66:25 - 66:31)
show where Zelda is awful I have a lot (66:27 - 66:34)
of games where I get to a point where it (66:31 - 66:36)
the game itself is not enjoyable or I (66:34 - 66:38)
get to the point where I'm satisfied (66:36 - 66:40)
with my experience and I don't have any (66:38 - 66:43)
more time to invest on it into it and I (66:40 - 66:46)
move on I can give a lot of examples but (66:43 - 66:47)
I'll just give like persona 5 for an (66:46 - 66:51)
example I put about 36 hours into that (66:47 - 66:55)
game and I got to the third a big third (66:51 - 66:58)
dungeon slash castle and I think there (66:55 - 67:01)
are seven in that game spoiler and I (66:58 - 67:03)
didn't stop because it was too difficult (67:01 - 67:04)
I didn't stop because it was frustrating (67:03 - 67:07)
I stopped because I didn't have enough (67:04 - 67:11)
time it was right before a bunch of (67:07 - 67:13)
conventions that came up I think c2e2 (67:11 - 67:17)
was the main one and there was enough (67:13 - 67:20)
time passed where now it feels awkward (67:17 - 67:23)
to go back to it like I don't know where (67:20 - 67:25)
I would even start or where to pick up (67:23 - 67:27)
but that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy the (67:25 - 67:29)
time I put into it and I felt like I got (67:27 - 67:32)
my money's worth out of that game (67:29 - 67:36)
referring specifically to Pokemon I (67:32 - 67:37)
think it's well known on the show that I (67:36 - 67:39)
did not finish black 2 and I didn't (67:37 - 67:41)
finish Omega Ruby alpha sapphire (67:39 - 67:45)
ironically both remakes of that well (67:41 - 67:48)
black to quote-unquote (67:45 - 67:50)
you know kind of the same area same (67:48 - 67:54)
stuff news story both both giving me the (67:50 - 67:57)
bin here done that attitude that I (67:54 - 68:00)
didn't really enjoy what broke me (67:57 - 68:05)
specifically of Pokemon Sun when I was (68:00 - 68:09)
playing it was trying to catch taboo (68:05 - 68:11)
lele everything (68:09 - 68:14)
up to that point I found pretty (68:11 - 68:16)
enjoyable there might have been one or (68:14 - 68:19)
two little sluggish parts I think the (68:16 - 68:23)
two mountains back-to-back not good in (68:19 - 68:25)
retrospect I don't know why they decided (68:23 - 68:28)
to do that trying to catch Tabu lele (68:25 - 68:30)
because I was I was on a luxury ball (68:28 - 68:34)
high loved the luxury ball go to ball (68:30 - 68:35)
the (68:34 - 68:38)
the L to the B it's a big luxury ball hi (68:35 - 68:40)
so trying to catch top Ola in a luxury (68:38 - 68:44)
ball was probably the most frustrating (68:40 - 68:46)
thing I've ever experienced in any (68:44 - 68:50)
Pokemon game you're at one HP you're (68:46 - 68:56)
asleep and I've wasted 56 luxury balls (68:50 - 69:00)
and I what what else am I supposed to do (68:56 - 69:03)
this is kind of an ultra ball use a (69:00 - 69:05)
timer ball use a ball that will actually (69:03 - 69:07)
catch the Pokemon so you can stop (69:05 - 69:08)
complaining about how hard they are to (69:07 - 69:11)
catch you're right I could use an Ultra (69:08 - 69:13)
Ball I could probably use the quick ball (69:11 - 69:16)
and caught it on turn one but for me (69:13 - 69:18)
that Pokemon is going straight into my (69:16 - 69:22)
bank I caught every other top ooh / (69:18 - 69:23)
legendary Pokemon up to this point with (69:22 - 69:26)
a luxury ball just wanted in the luxury (69:23 - 69:31)
ball and that's not fun I don't know how (69:26 - 69:34)
they make that experience better but (69:31 - 69:37)
anyways that is what broke me from Sun (69:34 - 69:38)
and Moon and that's ultimately why I (69:37 - 69:41)
stopped playing I recently went back to (69:38 - 69:43)
Sun and Moon a week ago actually the the (69:41 - 69:47)
night or two after I finished the (69:43 - 69:50)
podcast and I opened up my game and I (69:47 - 69:54)
was right in front of Taku Lele I shout (69:50 - 69:57)
out to Kevin who bred me a maybe he (69:54 - 70:00)
didn't bring me maybe he maybe he he (69:57 - 70:02)
took it from another person but shout (70:00 - 70:04)
out to Kevin he gave me a pair of sect (70:02 - 70:07)
with spore and false wipe and a couple (70:04 - 70:11)
of the moves but I'm gonna I cannot this (70:07 - 70:14)
that my train of thought is I cannot not (70:11 - 70:17)
catch this Pokemon I I cannot let myself (70:14 - 70:20)
walk away and just leave this endeavor (70:17 - 70:24)
behind I need to catch taboo Lele before (70:20 - 70:27)
I can actually enjoy the rest of Pokemon (70:24 - 70:30)
and I did I finally did it took another (70:27 - 70:35)
56 luxury balls and I caught it and then (70:30 - 70:37)
I moved on to tappable bulu and then I (70:35 - 70:40)
moved on to whatever the last one was (70:37 - 70:42)
finis because I already had top of cocoa (70:40 - 70:45)
uh and it it took a whole night and I (70:42 - 70:48)
now have all four (70:45 - 70:51)
Pappu's all in luxury balls and it feels (70:48 - 70:53)
really good and now I feel like I can go (70:51 - 70:57)
back to Pokemon Sun and feel comfortable (70:53 - 71:00)
yeah I feel comfortable now I feel like (70:57 - 71:02)
I can now enjoy the rest of that game (71:00 - 71:06)
but boy that it that experience was just (71:02 - 71:08)
so frustrating and I totally get why (71:06 - 71:10)
people drop off from that and why people (71:08 - 71:12)
move on to different games and I don't I (71:10 - 71:15)
don't know if I have an answer to like (71:12 - 71:17)
how you enjoy that for me enjoying it (71:15 - 71:23)
was to finally catch Taku Lele it was (71:17 - 71:25)
extremely frustrating until it was done (71:23 - 71:28)
and now I I feel very relieved that will (71:25 - 71:30)
do it for our emails but I will say (71:28 - 71:33)
speaking of games I don't enjoy I did (71:30 - 71:35)
play a little bit of played a little bit (71:33 - 71:38)
of black too recently I don't know if (71:35 - 71:39)
we'll saw that oh I did text will very (71:38 - 71:42)
angrily the other night that is correct (71:39 - 71:45)
catching pokémon and black 2 also not (71:42 - 71:48)
fun from what I read online it is harder (71:45 - 71:50)
to catch pokemon in black 2 than it (71:48 - 71:52)
wasn't black I don't know if that's true (71:50 - 71:54)
accurate or what the numbers are but it (71:52 - 71:56)
is very frustrating to catch pokemon in (71:54 - 71:59)
that game and and for example I feel (71:56 - 72:02)
like in Pokemon Sun and Moon I feel like (71:59 - 72:05)
every time you throw a Pokeball or a (72:02 - 72:08)
quick ball or a great ball just a normal (72:05 - 72:10)
ball I feel like almost every time you (72:08 - 72:12)
can pretty much catch that Pokemon on (72:10 - 72:14)
turn 0 or turn 1 whatever you want to (72:12 - 72:16)
call it lapsim you can't (72:14 - 72:20)
yeah but like no I get your point (72:16 - 72:21)
I just think it's funny because we were (72:20 - 72:23)
just talking about how difficult it was (72:21 - 72:24)
for you to catch all the tapas and the (72:23 - 72:27)
luxury balls yeah but I feel like the (72:24 - 72:29)
longer the battle goes on the harder is (72:27 - 72:30)
to catch because that I think there is (72:29 - 72:32)
an increased catch rate on the first (72:30 - 72:35)
turn if you do the first on the very (72:32 - 72:37)
first turn there is an entry for you at (72:35 - 72:40)
s direct that must not exist in black 2 (72:37 - 72:43)
because I couldn't catch anything on (72:40 - 72:46)
turn 0 but anyways I beat Scylla and (72:43 - 72:50)
black 2 and I made it to undulate áown (72:46 - 72:53)
so I made progress in black 2 the only (72:50 - 72:55)
reason I started playing black 2 is (72:53 - 72:58)
because I (72:55 - 73:00)
after this whole diamond and pearl talk (72:58 - 73:02)
that we had last week I went back and (73:00 - 73:04)
put diamond and pearl in I put eye on (73:02 - 73:07)
pearl it booted up just fine (73:04 - 73:09)
ran around with my little running shoes (73:07 - 73:12)
I went to my PC and then I saw that I (73:09 - 73:17)
had some of the the they're not fairies (73:12 - 73:19)
what are they spirits let's pray yeah (73:17 - 73:21)
must spread as often you see are the (73:19 - 73:23)
lake spirits yeah or the lake the lake (73:21 - 73:25)
spirits I noticed I had the lake (73:23 - 73:27)
guardians in my PC box and I was like (73:25 - 73:31)
these need to get moved over to Pokemon (73:27 - 73:31)
pink (73:31 - 73:34)
I don't know how to do this I heard that (73:31 - 73:36)
people said it was a sure uh it's (73:34 - 73:40)
extremely easy uh so I had to put in my (73:36 - 73:42)
copy of black one putting my copy of (73:40 - 73:44)
black one went to the lower research (73:42 - 73:45)
center which actually I was already (73:44 - 73:48)
standing by grabbed Ashley enough (73:45 - 73:51)
grabbed Irene's DS turned on display and (73:48 - 73:53)
then you have to do that minigame where (73:51 - 73:55)
you have to catch the Pokemon which I (73:53 - 73:57)
heard was time-consuming and not fun I (73:55 - 74:00)
wouldn't say it's fun it's probably more (73:57 - 74:03)
fun the magikarps jump but it's what I'm (74:00 - 74:04)
consuming when you have to do like a (74:03 - 74:07)
whole games worth see I didn't think so (74:04 - 74:09)
it took me eight minutes to do 26 (74:07 - 74:11)
Pokemon yeah but I think the most of the (74:09 - 74:13)
people that are complaining about that (74:11 - 74:15)
are like I am bringing up every Pokemon (74:13 - 74:18)
I have in this cartridge all like 20 (74:15 - 74:23)
boxes worth yet 649 minus 150 is what (74:18 - 74:28)
400 and 399 something like that or Pinot (74:23 - 74:32)
499 I bet less than 1% of Pokemon (74:28 - 74:35)
players had 399 Pokemon that they moved (74:32 - 74:39)
from Diamond and Pearl to black sure but (74:35 - 74:42)
those players are going to be more vocal (74:39 - 74:44)
than anyone else because there's a white (74:42 - 74:46)
Pokemon a whole bunch so once it's in (74:44 - 74:48)
black though the bank just sucks it (74:46 - 74:50)
right up so there's no more there's (74:48 - 74:52)
nothing the only thing you would have to (74:50 - 74:56)
do in black is put those Pokemon in the (74:52 - 74:59)
very first box and then Bank sucks up (74:56 - 75:00)
the first box can we do poke them out of (74:59 - 75:03)
the week before I have to go yeah well (75:00 - 75:06)
thanks hey Travis (75:03 - 75:09)
I played some old Pokemon I wanted to (75:06 - 75:12)
talk about it I told you I had until (75:09 - 75:17)
4:30 its 431 Steve give me the poke (75:12 - 75:18)
models I wanna I do want to thank you (75:17 - 75:21)
for being for moving things around in (75:18 - 75:23)
your schedule to accommodate me I (75:21 - 75:24)
appreciate I didn't realize what time it (75:23 - 75:27)
was I was so into engrained in my story (75:24 - 75:30)
ah hey what's a Pokemon our program of (75:27 - 75:34)
the week this week is Bastide on it is (75:30 - 75:38)
an evolution of the pop the fossil (75:34 - 75:41)
Pokemon shield on from the (75:38 - 75:44)
aforementioned diamonds and pearl gonna (75:41 - 75:45)
feature to movesets (75:44 - 75:49)
the first one is first I'll just say (75:45 - 75:52)
that that you're if you're actually (75:49 - 75:54)
using basket on and VGC in all (75:52 - 75:56)
likelihood you're using it for the move (75:54 - 75:57)
guard split which is a move that (75:56 - 76:00)
averages out the defense and special (75:57 - 76:03)
defense of the user and a target so you (76:00 - 76:04)
can give something that typically has (76:03 - 76:07)
very low defenses very high defenses and (76:04 - 76:08)
then Bastide on ax is a bit of a support (76:07 - 76:12)
Pokemon after you've bulked up another (76:08 - 76:15)
pokemons defenses but the tomb but that (76:12 - 76:17)
being said that too perhaps more (76:15 - 76:19)
interesting move sets that I'll feature (76:17 - 76:22)
are from users in slack the first one (76:19 - 76:25)
comes to us from actually both of these (76:22 - 76:27)
are pretty frequent contributors spoke (76:25 - 76:28)
one of the week this first one is Kevin (76:27 - 76:31)
fast yet on with leftovers with a sassy (76:28 - 76:33)
nature the ability sturdy which is that (76:31 - 76:35)
ability that makes it such that if a (76:33 - 76:38)
move would take out Bastion on from full (76:35 - 76:43)
HP instead survives with 1 HP your EVs (76:38 - 76:45)
are going to be 252 and HP and 252 and (76:43 - 76:47)
special defense with the remaining 4 in (76:45 - 76:49)
defense the moves are going to be (76:47 - 76:53)
stealth rock roar toxic and metal burst (76:49 - 76:57)
perhaps running protect over toxic Kevin (76:53 - 77:01)
says that's sort of half or you know six (76:57 - 77:02)
of one half dozen together which one you (77:01 - 77:05)
want to choose kevin says Bastide on is (77:02 - 77:07)
a pretty solid wall his main role is to (77:05 - 77:10)
mess with the enemy team with roar and (77:07 - 77:12)
then stealth rocks gives you some chip (77:10 - 77:16)
damage by using R or metal burst is like (77:12 - 77:18)
a steel version of counter which Kevin (77:16 - 77:20)
says sort of char (77:18 - 77:23)
that weakness of the fact that Bastide (77:20 - 77:24)
on doesn't really have a lot of (77:23 - 77:27)
offensive potential um so um metal (77:24 - 77:30)
bursts can kind of cover that toxic (77:27 - 77:34)
gives more damage pressure because like (77:30 - 77:36)
we said fast you down lacks it and then (77:34 - 77:39)
protect us is just a very handy move in (77:36 - 77:39)
doubles (77:39 - 77:42)
especially on a pokemon that you're (77:39 - 77:43)
looking to stall out the game with (77:42 - 77:46)
anyway because he with left over as (77:43 - 77:49)
you're gaining it exp and perhaps your (77:46 - 77:51)
partner Pokemon is doing some chip (77:49 - 77:53)
damage while you're protecting the next (77:51 - 77:57)
move set is from Gabe it's best you don (77:53 - 77:59)
this time with a rocky helmet and the (77:57 - 78:02)
ability sturdy again with a sassy nature (77:59 - 78:05)
same Eevee spread as before a similar (78:02 - 78:07)
move set in the sense that both of them (78:05 - 78:08)
have metal burst but actually all of the (78:07 - 78:10)
other moves are going to be different (78:08 - 78:13)
rockslide taunt and wide guard and as (78:10 - 78:16)
Gabe mentions this is more of a support (78:13 - 78:18)
set because you're using moves like wide (78:16 - 78:22)
guard to protect both Pokemon on your (78:18 - 78:25)
side of the field from moves that would (78:22 - 78:28)
hit both of them taunt is just a great (78:25 - 78:29)
support move to be able to shut down (78:28 - 78:32)
Pokemon that are going to do tricky (78:29 - 78:34)
things with not damaging moves metal (78:32 - 78:36)
bursts we already went over and then (78:34 - 78:39)
rockslide is just sometimes you need a (78:36 - 78:41)
move that just does damage with same (78:39 - 78:45)
type attack bonus as rockslide wood with (78:41 - 78:47)
bastion on there we go (78:45 - 78:50)
and trivia here is the wall of the (78:47 - 78:53)
castle in the courtyard Coliseum (78:50 - 78:56)
resembles bastions head and Bastian has (78:53 - 78:58)
the highest defense and special defense (78:56 - 79:01)
and the highest single base stat of all (78:58 - 79:04)
fossil Pokemon and if you get a shiny (79:01 - 79:08)
bastard on it is blue it has like a blue (79:04 - 79:12)
shield faceplate instead of the normal (79:08 - 79:15)
grayish steel faceplate maybe Pokemon (79:12 - 79:18)
that is often forgot about I like it (79:15 - 79:22)
though it's cool some housecleaning real (79:18 - 79:26)
