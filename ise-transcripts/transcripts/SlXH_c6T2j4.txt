[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 270 eighth episode of the Pokemon podcast it's super effective I'm your host SBJ and with me today is will I have a trainer tip for you stealing other people's pokémon makes you no better than a thief I just read that on a sign on the street Britt what really yeah I was walking down the street and there was this wooden sign and I looked at it and it said stealing other people's pokémon makes you no better than a thief look I don't want to hear what you found in Sun and Moon because you're the only person in the world still playing this game you may be correct no that's not true I know we did all you twos doing a mono ice run we did a Twitter poll there's 20% of people who bought the game are still playing in it it's almost like no one ah Travis is back that's true we're recording this on Father's Day so I want to ask the two of you what you think is the most fatherly Pokemon yeah baby Arctic knows knows great answers from but I'm I'm curious as to why you didn't go pro BOPE asks for the full effect but I think very strong answers from both of you thank you all right well welcome this is a Pokemon podcast we have a little bit of Pokemon news III just happened so what maybe we'll we'll spend just a smidgen of time on that then we'll go into our Pokemon news then we have some emails we didn't do emails last week so we will do a couple emails and then we have our Pokemon of the week and that will be the show for you guys today but let's start with III I mean a lot a lot of games were shown I think a lot of our listeners were probably the most excited for the Nintendo Direct or whatever they were calling it I don't think the house of terror yeah three I don't think they used the word direct I just think it was a tree house presentation I'm not it might have been like III digital event or oh yeah yeah something silly besides the Mario and pokken tournament that they in splatoon and arms a little bit of you know they those games are coming out soon Mario Odyssey the big thing they showed which we already know about they did take two seconds and to me it seemed like the announcement of a core Pokemon game coming to switch was kind of shoehorn in there okay we're gonna enter well it felt that way because they couldn't even show us anything from it and even then I forget which person from the Pokemon company was the person that cut too but he was saying something along the lines of we can't show you anything and it won't even be for a few years but hey we're making a core series Pokemon game on the switch so all right back to you that's that's very much like when I'm at work and I have to do like a presentation on how much money we're paying to one of our technology vendors or something and I like only remember that I'm supposed to be doing it be like five minutes before the presentation so I walk in the room and I'm like yeah I'm still crunching the numbers and yeah we send a lot of money to that company for technology services all right you guys have a good day short meeting today goodbye it's what because will and I were talking last week about how controlling Pokemon is with their their message and messages and their marketing and how they say things and this twenty second we're gonna cut to you sitting at your desk you're not even presenting like a Pokemon purse like Pokemon has presented in the past of you standing in front of a carefully crafted wall of Pokemon plushies we're just gonna cut to you at your desk and you're gonna go yeah it's all gets coming guys don't worry about it you get that sort of thing every once in a while and I'm sure it's a function of the fact that the Pokemon company is that strange second-party developer that they are you know I'm sure has something to do with the fact that they're kind of Nintendo and kind of not like it game freak rather I said the Pokemon company but the fact that gamefreak is like a second-party developer and the Pokemon company is like a second party publisher like I'm sure it makes for every once in a while some awkward things like that but yeah I think you're right on the whole that they're very particular with their messaging and you know what I'll actually come back at you guys from the opposite angle because honestly the only visual they gave us was like it's like a black screen with Pokemon game on switch coming 2018 something right right yeah they are so scared of SBJ national treasury every freaking image that comes out of them that they're like no no no you were gonna put a Pikachu on there but if the Pikachu is looking to the left they're gonna say oh diamond and pearl remakes because in Diamond and Pearl the west side of the island was the warm side and obviously that's what pika she was looking towards yeah I mean that makes sense yeah I was gonna say I thought you were gonna say because she was looking to the left therefore it's a look to the past is looking backwards into the past earlier would have a diamond pearl remake and then someone else would be like well actually the directionality of text is different in Japanese so it's not necessarily what that yeah that's right Japanese people would read from right to left so you have to take that into account mm-hmm look I didn't make this podcast last seven years without doing a little speculation we said this last week where maybe I said it I think we'll agreed with me that I can't imagine a another console coming out to replace the 3ds in in any means because of the whole I don't think the market is big enough for a switch to exist and another new handheld just kind of makes sense that Pokemon would eventually move to switch yeah I agree Hey I'm curious to see if they do a thing where it's also released on a dedicated handheld as well as on the switch but at this point it seems unlikely given that as they mentioned the new Pokemon game won't be for a few years and while I know some people disagree to me it makes sense that the switch is a console that is an attempt to consolidate both markets and a replacement for both the console and handheld markets so I doubt that we'll have a successor to the direct successor to the 3ds in that time and it would seem very strange to release a core Pokemon game on the 3ds in two years when that system is all as old as likes in I don't know yeah the 3ds will be seven years come early early next year and I don't even think like the ps3 and the Xbox lasted about seven years xbox360 lasted about seven to eight years before they should before the ps4 and the Xbox one came out now that's not to say they didn't continue releasing games after said consoles came out I I leaned more towards this game coming out not I wouldn't be surprised if we got it next fall I know they said hey we just started working on it but again that seemed that a whole message of we're gonna quickly cut through your desk hey we're working on it we don't have anything to show you by just seem very rushed of okay we just need to say something guys we just need to feel 30 seconds and get switch owners excited because Pokemon is a system seller there's no doubt about it of how many copies they sell so if we if we already have Zelda we have splatoon we have pokken we have arms coming out with Super Mario to see their real message is we want to sell these things for Christmas that is to say if they can they can keep them in if they can stock shelves with them but you have just a few games plus you're putting out your biggest franchise in the world Mario this Christmas and you know Pokemon is coming okay now is the time to pull the trigger because I'm gonna need it eventually so I might as well get it around Mario yep and it makes it very clear that ultra Sun ultramoon are just filler to carry us one more year the only reason why I wouldn't be surprised if it came out November of 2018 I'll even push that to like March of 2019 because sometimes they like to do that early spring release when they when they need a little bit more time with I think both diamond and pearl diamond pearl definitely came out in spring might have been April but anyways I just can't see them taking another year off like to go here's here's ultra Sun ultra moon in November 17th less 364 days after Sun and Moon so it's not really it's not really a new game it's just filler and then we're gonna take a whole another year off yeah that just seems really stretching it that reasoning makes sense to me the I think the only and I should be clear I agree with you but I think it's worth someone saying the other side of the argument which is that it is still a little strange that if it were coming out within a year that they wouldn't even have like a title or some sort of teaser like the original teaser they did for pokken tournament though people are like oh what is that and they don't even say the name of it like some thing but I think like if you think about it in the context of they just announced ultra Sun and ultra moon what was it four days prior to that they probably don't want to model their messaging and confuse people about which games are coming out one so I tend to agree with you yeah even if they are pretty far along and maybe made maybe this goes back to Eurogamer saying they heard saw whatever their original rumor was we we talked about it last week they saw pokemon running on switch whether that was Sun and Moon whether that was a new game whether that was ultra Sun Ultra moon it almost makes it clear that they just didn't think about this two weeks ago hey what do you guys want to do for e3 I guess it's time to move consoles already these days these decisions don't happen overnight but I even you know if they're a year into development of this game or whatnot it doesn't it will maybe hurt ultra Sun and ultra moon if they went up there and they said something because like we'll alluded to earlier myself and many fans would tear that apart of okay is this generation eight is this a remake is this a remake of a remake is this a whole new game is this actually are they actually turning Pokemon Ranger into a core series game and that's what they mean because they're both RPGs a remake of a remake it would be like Pokemon burning fire red and Pokemon nourishing leaf green they just keep adding adjectives and adjectives till it's like Pokemon feels a passion fire burning red that sounds alright I mean when you title your game that ridiculous ridiculously I can't help to buy it at that point the black screen with just the Pokemon logo I think was the safe bet right because then you don't you don't give fans you give fans enough excitement to go okay finally I know that Pokemon is moving to this council it's safe to buy this console and or I already have this console so I feel good that eventually I will get it but you don't give enough information away to going oh they're just they're just remaking Emerald version and I don't care about read I don't care about going back in time that would be such a terrible yeah after they released horas like not they just skip Diamond and Pearl and they just go forever you guys ranted and raved about gen 3 for so long we're gonna double down and we're gonna triple down on Gen 3 we're gonna get you to keep redoing gen 3 till you're sick of it and then you know what we're gonna do it five times more you thought you hated well I was sick of it I was sick I was yeah I was sick of it before they made the remake so I get if they're doing it five more times I guess that's for more remakes to expect it was a cool announcement though it was maybe it's because I am such a big Pokemon fan that I was satisfied with that but it it was funny that their excuse was and we're not gonna show you anything because we only want to show you games coming out this year and here's Metroid Prime four it's not coming out this year and here's a couple other games also not coming out this year I think all of the games for which they showed gameplay were games that were releasing in the year of our Arceus 2017 so I think maybe that's what they meant was there any of those games that stood out was let's talk about Nintendo real quick anything else from Nintendo it was thirty minutes they had the treehouse stuff after but anything stood out to you guys video game wise uh once I heard that the thing that I cared about wasn't going to be on Nintendo I ignored III for the rest of the week yep they didn't announce Monster Hunter double-cross Nintendo fans very upset I don't think Nintendo showed anything I was really excited for like Mario Odyssey looks very good it does look good but that wasn't a surprise sure sure yeah I mean I think a lot of people are excited about the prospect of a new Metroid Prime game after what like a decade plus of those games not existing I think a lot of people are excited for that I can't say I've played more than the first Metroid Prime game so um that wasn't me but I think a lot of listeners are probably yelling at their phones saying that did people like Yoshi's woolly world I think people like Yoshi's wooly world so they're excited for a new one of those yeah but everybody's ever everybody's not really driving about arms but thank anybody zi amped about arms that games out yep it came out what we're according to some sunday came out on Friday I guess I'm uh I guess I'm late to releasing the armory and arms fan cast that I'll never do man that's a good name real good name actually ours I'm assuming the arm and Armory would be all caps yes good you got that that probably has some good SEO too it's good iTunes search history I watched hell yeah like I was really hoping for Animal Crossing that was really that was like good two things I wanted out of Nintendo was an animal crossing and a monster hunter they didn't show up monster runner they showed that in another stage and you know to be honest I was more excited that it's coming to PlayStation 4 and Xbox more a little more excited for me I'm still going an important double cross I'm switch I'll still get my monster hunter Phil there that's fine the treehouse stuff they that's that's where they showed all the 3ds games I don't think they showed a single 3ds game during the initial 30 minutes that's because the 3ds is dying still very unhappy with the console because of its age no no comment I'm not gonna contribute to your madness and your constants creeds against a perfectly fine console that they're coming out with the 2d SXL over the summer so they haven't completely given up on but go on yeah and you know what they showed for 3ds nothing but remakes hey did you like isn't there a new Mario superstars a remake squad it's a remake no never mind ah the only new game they showed was like some sushi game which looks like a free-to-play mobile game but it's a puzzle game looks alright and then they showed another Metroid game they're really doubling down on Metroid they showed a remake of metroid 2 which I believe was the original Gameboy game so that's coming to 3s and didn't show anything of ultra Sun ultra moon but Pokemon has never been up never had a place at e3 so Rogel yeah mmm let's anything anything from Sony well I mean Monster Hunter world looks real good it's it's not out play video games well you want to talk about monster hunter or well I mean it's there's just not a lot of information out there it looks really like the look is cool but you you and I both know that Monster Hunter they make really really cool like movies about the game that don't necessarily reflect the actual gameplay so I haven't seen any actual gameplay yet so I can't I can't say anything I mean it'll it's yes on my TV something I wanted so that's worth getting excited about high res graphics all that stuff it seems like they're keeping enough of the you know traditional Monster Hunter tropes that people will enjoy but you know my sore spot is that you know I was hoping to carry over all the work I've put into Monster Hunter generations into a TV based game and I won't be able to do that so that's all well to be fair they've never allowed any American versions to transfer ever stuff well why did they have to hate on America so much maybe this was their opportunity to not be haters that's true maybe generations those been four years in the making and it's being made by the core team that did master her for you you mean Monster Hunter world yes sorry world yes is being made by the team that made for Monster Hunter 4 they've been doing making world for four years and then another team took over for four ultimate and generations and double cross anything from Microsoft they had the best presentation because they had this voice that kept saying exclusive like over and over and over and it was great and it was like literally the same voice every single time exclusive I watched the entire Microsoft presentation because I couldn't find the Sony presentation and I mean it didn't make me excited to be an Xbox one owner but the we'll see if some of the older titles deserve doing the reverse compatibility project will get me excited when I'll you uh play that fusion frenzy again I don't know what that is wait which which console had the game where it's like the mech suits it's kind of open world and you you have mech suits that you can modify and stuff like was that Sony or was that an Armored Core I don't know I was having my I think you're thinking of new custom Robo for the Gamecube no monster rancher anyways that game looked cool so I know many of our listeners know again though I'm talking about so III I was pretty satisfied with it I mean really the only thing I wanted out of III was Monster Hunter and they gave me Monster Hunter and they gave me a Pokemon eventually coming to switch so I can't be too upset with with both those announcements speaking of announcements there has there's some news to talk about first bit of news here is marsh shadow has officially been revealed and marsh marsh a DMZ is also been shown some are shadow can do its Z move they will be available in Japan at the 20th movie screening marsh shadow will be strizheus Maur shadow will be distributed via local wireless for Pokemon Sun and Moon at the screening of pokémon the movie 20 I'd choose you at theaters in Japan the marsh shadow will already be holding marsh a DMZ this marsh shadow will be level 50 it will know the moves spectral thief close combat force palm and shadow ball it has a wishing ribbon and it will be in a cherish ball spectral thief is marsh shadow signature move and has not previously been officially revealed although fans have discovered in the game data uh if marsh shadow holds marsh a DMZ it can upgrade spectral thief to its exclusive Z move soul stealing seven star strike soul stealing seven stars strike had not been a previous revealed but also this was discovered in the game's data they showed that in the video this news-miner man oh sorry this news might have been right before they they actually showed the video a cool but yeah even even the American Twitter the the American Pokemon Twitter and the American Pokemon Instagram showed shut off Mar shadow to which I can't remember a Pokemon they showed in Japan that they showed so fast in America volcanium was the last one maybe or was a Deanne say no not I couldn't tell you McGee or nah maybe anyways next bit of news here is the I choose you cat Pikachu will appear in ultra Sun and ultra moon this is the Pikachu wearing the Ash Ketchum hat it will be available via QR code like McGee Erna in Pokemon Sun and Moon Pokemon ultrasound ultramoon sorry in Japan the QR code will appear at a special pokey Pokemon got all a disc that will be given away at the screenings of pokémon the movie xx I choose you three million copies of the disc will be available throughout Japan mcginnis QR code was made available in a similar way so for clarification current Japanese copies of Pokemon Sun and Moon will get this Pikachu but for America in order to get this Pikachu we have to wait too we have to wait for ultra Sun and ultra moon so there you have it very important Pokemon Center hose it oh go ahead is that a disc thing you are mentioning is that in reference to that arcade series where you can like save information on a little disc and then bring it with you to the arcade cabinet and sort of like save your team data and go from cabinet to cabinet essentially with an arcade version of Pokemon where your team is preserved by the discs is that what that is now I think your um it's Pokemon gaoler is the soccer Pokemon game that that's coming out well what kid there's no you can't do puns well we'll ask our we'll ask our Japanese resident Andrew let's see what he can provide when it comes to the Pokemon go lowly go Olli Gogol Olli important Pokemon Center update teams go Pikachu now I want Pokemon Center the wait is over finally timeis recording is up the tickets or the Pokemon go Fest in Chicago will probably be sold out they go on sale in exactly 22 hours of us recording this they don't have a price don't have what is actually happening but they will be on sale tomorrow will and I talked about this event for a good what 20 minutes last week Travis you weren't here but did you have a long time did you have yeah that's because that heracross is in the picture and the exclamation mark unknown is in the picture they're both very important details of that poster they showed Travis did you have any thoughts opinions on Pokemon go fest no I'm not gonna go to it so I haven't really been focusing a lot of my energies on thinking about it is it because you're not playing go anymore is it because you hate video games or is it because it's too far away which of the three options is it or option D all of the above it's actually option F because option E is it costs money to travel and then option F is now all of the above no I it's like a two and a half to three hour drive to Chicago from what I am you can do that in a day though um yeah but like I have to really like Pokemon go and I only play a tiny bit of Pokemon go like a little bit every day or so and I I don't know I don't I'm traveling a lot in the coming months and gotta to watch the old budget the old travel budgets oh yeah yeah I know uh Steve is still playing a lot of Pokemon go because I'm like in the middle of some random activity during my day yesterday and my watch goes off and it's like Steve completed a workout and I'm like no he didn't and I'd like like what is his location where is Steve right now and guess what Lake Park I almost like sent you a nasty text message about your quote workout unquote but I let it be what was this yesterday because it definitely yes sir I biked six miles yesterday and I thought I did not get a notice for well it was I think it was all part of the because when I start the workout on the watch I don't think he can tell you what the difference between me walking or biking is nor do I pay that much attention it was a good workout though and then I got stuck in the down I got stuck in a downpour I was completely soaked but yeah I've I went I played two hours of Pokemon go this morning with my sister I played five hours of Pokemon go yesterday with my mom and I've pretty much been out every single day this week because of the fire and ice event which again by the time this episode is up there'll be one day left but it's it's cool like I I appreciate the monthly events they've been doing because I think it does give you for me at least and I'm sure for many other people because while I've been out pretty much every day this week to at least do some Pokemon go whether that's you know 11 o'clock at night or early in the morning I have seen tons and tons of people out playing pokemon go like like will said I was at Lake Park and probably saw over 20 different people at like park playing and you know stopped and talked with them and they asked you know what the general Pokemon go questions what team are you on to catch anything good hey there's a squirtle over there you know the three general Pokemon go questions and we went over to be art museum and discovery world and there was again more Pokemon go players there so yeah it's it's they still exist they're out there doing stuff um but yeah I'm very happy with Pokemon go I'm very very excited for the Pokemon go fest I guess we'll have more information next week when we know how much tickets are when we know what I don't even know if tomorrow they'll actually say what's happening I'm assuming that tickets are just gonna go up people are gonna buy them and we're still gonna be left in the dark of what's actually going to be at this event but the last bit of Pokemon news we have is Pokemon girl related which is pretty much just that the gyms will be closing tomorrow all Pokemon go gyms will be closing on June 19th for the rework so if you have a Pokemon currently at the gym it will be returned to you so that is that that is all our Pokemon news I feel like I'm forgetting something but good thing this is pre-recorded and I could put it in Prior if that is if that's needed so what we'll do now is we'll take a quick break when we come back we'll do some emails and we'll do our pokemon of the week why would you make a portable system when the switch exists with a slightly smaller screen and what a worse processor why why wouldn't it Tendo do that why why why wouldn't it Tendo choose that why [Music] shut up [Music] what why when I gave brainless good version of that Wow [Music] and we are back from our break let's do some emails you have any questions comments or concerns you can shoot your email over to SBJ at pkmn cast comm or you can go over to pokemon podcast comm and hit the contact button both will send an email over my way first email here is from Joshua from Kona vet tri convinced I Rhode Island CoV ent are why ya Coventry is so is Josh on the island or in in the island that's where it gets weird cuz Rhode Island is not an island exactly alright good writes in and says hey guys I just started listening to you last week and I went through the hours of stuff and absolutely loved it I'd like to just run an idea past all of you about a new pokemon game for switch and would love to hear your thoughts on it I don't know if this was before or after e3 so what if the new game was something along the lines of a whole Pokemon world where you could visit and travel throughout every pokemon region this would give hours of gameplay and would allow us to do so much obviously a lot of the game would have to be downloadable add-ons and such would this be something you guys would like to see in a Pokemon game force which I know I'd pay good money to see this and play it well that's all I got have a great week happy hunting Josh well I would say if and this is a will Anderson seal it with wax prediction statement dictum I don't know what word you want to use if they ever come out with a game where it is travel to all of the regions travel to any region that will be the capstone to Pokemon and that would be the end of Pokemon whoa I don't think they would ever do something like this exactly because their world is crumbling save the Pokemon world one last time in every region of poke earth I I would love this I I think it's very unlikely just given how much development time it would take to make every single region because I mean sure the other regions already exist in older games but you still have to do the same process they do for the remakes where you create them in a context of stronger graphical capabilities and that takes just all that would take so long with all of that that said even if it's unrealistic that would be quite incredible and I would enjoy it a lot there are a couple reasons why this would probably never happen I don't one being I don't think the I don't think we'll ever get another game with more than one region based on the fact of my complaint last week that these Pokemon fans keep demanding remakes and this this is part of the problem they are so ready and willing to buy diamond and pearl before even a hint that diamond and pearl remakes would ever exist that they have no reason to ever merge or combine regions in the same game because as we saw with omega ruby and alpha sapphire you just complain long enough and loud enough you'll get your remake and you'll get to go back to it and I think the second reason is I don't know weird is probably not the right word I'm just gonna use it anyways it would be weird where there would be a game that you catch all the Pokemon in agreeing with wills point if you could catch all the Pokemon there then you wouldn't have to branch out to these other games I mean ultimately maybe if it's not a capstone to Pokemon altogether and they never make another Pokemon any game after that it would be the end to this Pokemon planet and we'd start go to a different Pokemon planet where it's like just completely new everything new no no start back at back at number one like don't even clear exact hold the sword and the new pokedex I would I would hmm that seems radical but I would actually beat down with that like we are cool I mean they they say that every time they're like Oh Gen 5 it's a it's a fresh start like we're starting with 151 new Pokemon and you're not gonna say a single one until you beat the I would I would be okay with like closing the book we're starting again although they can't do that because they've already had us buy into Pokemon bank with the promise that we will always get to keep our Pokemon through every single Pokemon game in perpetuity but in a theoretical world where that isn't the case like that would actually be kind of cool and bold is there any franchise in videogame history that was like hey everything we've done up to this point let's all merge it together and then sell you an all-time I like the Final Fantasy fighting games like it wasn't the sky of Final Fantasy we're all where you get your your Cloud Strife fighting your squall Leonhart is that what the city is I don't know is that what did I say Disgaea Final Fantasy I think this guy is a different video game franchise I think you're right I think it's Dissidia I mean I saw a preview for that and I was like wow that looks boring as heck and it probably is isn't there also like a rhythm game a rhythm game hmm a Final Fantasy oh yeah whatever you hope here's the here's the other thing about this ultimate world why don't thinking whatever exists is because if you spend the time to do it and there are so many issues gameplay flow wise of okay if they're supposed to be what's I don't know what's 8 times 7 at this point 56 there's 56 gym leaders how are you supposed to balance that with level how are you supposed to balance Pokemon in the wild with level besides all that you know just making the game feel good and compelling throughout that entire world slash zone how do you pitch that to Pokemon fans and more importantly Pokemon I think Pokemon fans want that I think Pokemon fans would eat that up like the idea of a game with such a wide number of places to go and such a extensive single-player journey I think Pokemon fans would eat that up in my opinion the more pressing question is how do you follow that up then because now you're expected to do that every time and I don't think they would really be able to pull that off every time they're at least a game it's like Pokemon eventually evolves into Skyrim and it's like oh ok new DLC with quests and it becomes quest based and like yawn city look if there's anything I know that is we will continue to get Skyrim forever III mine destiny III 2018 be prepared to see more versions of Skyrim but no what I was saying is how do you pitch that to Pokemon fans but more importantly how do you pitch that to non Pokemon fans as if that is a good question as a company I I would assume that Pokemon always wants to top their last game not only in sales but increasing their fan base Sun and Moon is the top of that pillar of okay Sun and Moon has sold more copies than X&Y more copies than black and white more copies than diamond and pearl then they're on the right track to growing that that fanbase if they release a generation 8 is it going to top sun and moon' sales I'm I I would hope so I'm sure they'd gamefreak and the Pokemon company would also hope that but if they show a generation 8 and they show something like this where hey this is all the regions is that going to bring in even more fans I don't really think so especially since just look at like something like Pokemon go players that brought more fans that brought more overall players to the franchise of Pokemon than any of the core main series games have and I think even more so than red and blue and gold and silver which are the two best-selling games in the series but there is a substantial drop off to that and we know with Sun and Moon that there's a substantial drop off to that and those are your hardcore pokemon players I think I don't have the data in front of me so if I'm wrong that's fine but I'm pretty sure less than 20% of people actually continue playing after the main story they beat the leaf or they're done they close they close their DS they move on to a different game you have such a small percentage of players actually trying to complete their pokedex or actually trying to do the endgame stuff whereas the hardcore players that would love that game most of them probably by generation 8 will have close to a living decks if not a complete pokedex so what is the appeal for them battling 56 Gym Leaders and then countless trainers in between and them battling elite for like it just doesn't seem it just seems like a pipe dream with no real direction and I think that's the most important part to that is what is the direction well they could make it's it's like you get special Pokemon by completing certain quests or something like that I mean they can change the format it just goes back to the whole argument of people demanding a Pokemon MMO but I feel like a lot of those people demanding it have never actually played an MMO like the end game to World of Warcraft for the end game - final fantasy xiv or final fantasy xi or EverQuest or I'll even throw destiny in there like the end game - those games are so different than the actual story part that they tell like like the storm blood the new Final Fantasy expansion will have you know 60 to 70 story missions and that will tell you a story just like the Pokemon games do and you will level up throughout that story just like in Pokemon games what the difference is there is a real end game at the end of that where you're riding for loot and you're not there's zero story and you're doing harder and harder challenges and yeah that kind of that sure that kind of exists in Pokemon where you're catching pokémon you're you're fighting harder and harder gimli battle tree people or just trainers in general but you're doing all that solo you're never doing that with people so that doesn't make sense in an MMO aspect where you're trying to be you you're in something like Final Fantasy or Warcraft you're doing like these 24 man group raids or 60 man raids or whatnot and Pokemon there's never anything like that not with that attitude I was exactly gonna say look we're gonna take the battle royale but instead of one verse one verse one we're gonna do one verse one verse one verse one verse a hundred and we're going to stream it live I like that though you're gonna think outside of the box dude yeah and outside of the bun excuse me isn't that the Taco Bell thing maybe cuz that one a 80s or 90s drop the chalupa hmm what do they now live mas grande I think it's just live mas yeah he used it used to be think outside the bun I mean that's a pretty good thing it is yeah no one's debating with Taco Bell's marketing team yeah here's the debate Popeyes is the best fried chicken now you can shut your mouth KFC is pretty good Mike writes in title that why we need a diamond apple remake 24 theses on why yeah he's gonna nail it to the daughter of the Cathedral the reason why is because pokemon mystery dungeon teased dark slash primal diet I can't do it Dialga dialga yes boss and still have yet to provide also we could use improved versions of those awful generation 5 starters they are the worst charters and superior is only Salvage by its hidden ability there are other Pokemon that could use mega forms also you should do a podcast series for postgame Sun and Moon do you think the new Pokemon in ultra Sun and ultramoon our forms of soul Galia and loon Allah or necrosha also would you like break to replace mega there's like so much going on and evil it's a it's a flavor adventure yeah all right let's start backwards break is the mechanic they use in the TCG but it's the same thing as Z moves isn't it ya know might one time and nothing should replace anything let's go let's make that clear mega is fine it's cool it exists I hope it continues to exist knowing Pokemon and their ways they're very stubborn when it comes to changing things you can look at arc arcanine as example it is known as the legendary Pokemon it is not legendary I think they should change that but they won't and that's v working backwards again do you think Pokemon do you think the new Pokemon in ultra Sun and ultramoon are the forms of soul Gallio and lalala orna KRAS ma I'll let will handle that they're fusions of Nick rasma and so Galle oh and Nick rasma and Lu Nala that's it's the same thing as black theorem and white Kira might get those vibes yep except that they're symmetrical they're not asymmetrical I'm sure there will be a new gimmick to go with that so it's slightly different than yeah yeah I wouldn't here yeah it probably won't be exactly like it I agree yeah new Pokemon is there any Pokemon that that exists that we don't have in Sun and Moon currently besides marsh shadow document that exists yeah can't get into Pokemon Sun and Moon right like you know how we knew about Volcarona or not well not Volcarona haini haini on 4 you know 14 months before it actually listed I do not believe data miners have well as I'm halfway through that statement I believe people have found spaces where except that was on a website not in the actual data of the of the game the only thing I could think of was the McGee onna that looked like a pokeball instead of being all grey yeah that's a form change yeah but they consider new forms new Pokemon I think in ultra Sun ultra moon I mean since we haven't had an opportunity today my data mine that I think we need to get that demo rip it apart and see what's going on inside before we actually can say anything about that so if we've got my prediction pure prediction prior to ultra Sun el tribunal Anderson we are going to get a variation on mimic you where it can wear different costumes and the different costume changes its secondary type memory type I don't remember which that's less that's some good speculation my guess would be there would be three to four new ultra beast oh yeah like that's a gimme yeah I'd agree I mean you got ultra in the title Travis address the concern of all full generation five starters I don't know I like I like John five I like Oshawott I like Snivy who doesn't like asha wat what is wrong if you don't like asha wat go talk to a doctor because there's something medically wrong if you're a hatred of Oshawott lasts for more than three hours please contact a medical professional yes exactly uh and then going back to the first statement mystery dungeon teased a dark and primal alga so that that's confirmation right guys no I think that's just a thing that was in the one game yeah I don't think the mystery dungeon games are canon what about shadow lugia from Gale of darkness I mean I'm I'm waiting I'm waiting on it for sure that's no that's it's yeah it's it's exactly like that it's just like sometimes side games have alternate forms of Pokemon that exist in the main series games then do not reappear in the main series yeah I think gala darkness is a really good game to look to shadow lugia didn't exist outside of that I think it's cool that you can look back at yellow darkness and go yeah shadow lugia is a cool pokemon is it possible they bring it to a future Pokemon game sure but they have had over a decade to do so and they have not I think another good pokemon to look at is is it is it shadow Mewtwo in pokken tournament that is correct yeah that's another good Pokemon to look - and when Namco Bandai talked about actually creating that Pokemon because they were the ones to do so they said they worked very closely with Game Freak because they did not want to or maybe it was creatures I can't remember which people actually make the Pokemon they worked really closely because they didn't want it to seem like an unnatural fit in the Pokemon universe with that being said there's no plans or there was never any discussion of shadow Mewtwo actually moving to a core Pokemon game and I think that's fine I think that that Pokemon exists in that space and that's totally okay just like Santa hat Pikachu exists in Pokemon go and that's totally okay I think where it gets confusing is the fact that primal was then an adjective that got used in the core series with primal Groudon and primal Kyogre and so it seems like well if primal die all go was the thing in a side game like why isn't it but I think it's just a matter of they used the same word twice for two kind of different things because primal Dialga in its depiction pokemon mystery dungeon is quite a different thing it's just that happens to use the same word at least in my opinion is diamond and pearl gonna get remade they may where they've remade everything up to this point yeah maybe probably I'm not gonna ask for it but if they deliver it sure fine because all that all that's going to happen is after a diamond pearl get remade people are gonna demand a remake for black and white it's an ongoing cycle personally I would rather have new games and new concepts over remakes but if the remakes are what's filling in the gaps sure fine but I don't think there has ever been anything substantial to confirm that we are getting diamond and pearl remakes I mean you can look in games and so a Sun and Moon Lily goes to Kanto that Kanto remakes confirmed or in Sun and Moon there was a lot of talk about fossils and fossils existed over it's just speculation at that point and and there's nothing wrong with speculation we do this all the time on the show that's we got to talk about something every week so that's really fine I don't know if mystery dungeon though is the best to look to towards confirmation and pretty banks agreed so what I was gonna say is when you're in your car and you want to turn up the volume on the radio what do you turn the dial not you you're you trying to get me to say valium no whether you turn what is the thing on that your dashboard the dial or the knob dial got dial guhh maybe you get oh yeah you can get it you can do it Colin writes in from Wichita Falls Texas hey guys big fan of the show and I just wanted to comment that neither me nor my friends have seen any leg while plant playing Sun and Moon s PJ and Travis are the only people I've ever heard of having leg on the new 3ds I do not use the new 3ds if you listen to our set of Moon specials Myka and Irene also complain about this but going in unless they skip those episodes firstly we don't have a lot installed on the 3ds could that be the reason we have not noticed leg I believe Sun and Moon works fine in the nude 3ds as long as you have plenty of open memory what are your all thoughts will and Travis are both my favorites Colin so I will add in league with the listener I will say I did not notice lag until I started looking for it it's not like one thing if you play Sun and Moon on an original original 3ds switch I have one that is painful there are like literally black screens while you wait for things to load that's real painful but look while you're in a battle for the opposing Pokemon - like it's sort of it does while it's waiting for you to select a move alright if you're really quick and selecting a move and everything like that you're not gonna see it but if you pay attention while what the other pokemon is doing while you are selected wait not selecting a move but just like kind of looking at it well it's like what are you gonna do um you'll notice it slows down that pokemon is not moving perhaps lag is the incorrect term when we're referring to a drop in the frame rate but um that is what you get from what I know not from what I know from what I have heard having a full SD card as I did does have the negative effect under games frame rate also I would guess the brand of brand of SSD card matters - right and the S and the reason that brand matters is because you have different speed classes of SD cards so maybe I had a slower one and I was running the game off of it but also like out of the three of us sorry to stop you Travis out of the three of us did we all get it digitally or did some or do any of you have cartridge-based I have cartridge-based son did you notice a difference between the cartridge and the SD card but once again I don't I don't look right so no not yet at least Travis you're my only hope it digitally okay you can continue your thought I probably I don't if I think I was basically I think I was basically done just that having a full SD card makes it slow I was running on an original 3ds I am certain I'm not the only one on the internet talking about framerate drops in battles especially during Z moves or battles involving more than two Pokemon that's a pretty well-documented phenomenon well well said yeah it's it's pretty well documented did I I first noticed it when Irene started the game because I was already an hour or two in and I wanted to I wanted to be there when she had her initial thoughts and impressions starting up the game because I knew that it was very cutscene heavy and all these characters were getting introduced and I just couldn't believe how long it took between cutscenes to load while I say leg referring to the frame wrap frame rate dropping and she noticed too she noticed it to the point where she was like this is unplayable we upgraded her to a new 3ds of FF a week later because she did really unplayable it's not in true I mean like those complaints I think are valid it's yeah yeah I just heard something basically said a meme so I had to make fun of you for errantly saying a meme it's funny because our Travis your complaints and my complaints about Magikarp jump is the menus take too long to load yeah yeah and I have a new 3ds I have plenty of space on my SD card I have the you know quote-unquote BES SD card you can buy for the 3ds and I still noticed it now did I notice it as much as somebody playing on our original 3ds no of course not the new 3ds does have a better processor things run better but any time an ultra beast battle happened or any time a Pokemon like top lele did something like misty surge which i think is what it does i know a very easy to point it out there doesn't any of this matter no I'm not really anymore are they gonna fix it no Tristana ultramoon yeah probably not yeah oh really doubtful yeah ah message here from bog bars that sounds like a rejected name for a bounty hunter in Star Wars I hope that's not someone's real name it's bog bars bog bars so probably not probably not legally doesn't sound like dengar charge I couldn't couldn't you see him right now there next to couldn't you see bagua right there next to I G 88 and dengar and whatever the lizard dudes name is it sounds like a Mass Effect character message the legends is basically Mass Effect messages all praised well the widest the wisest and goodness I'll take it tell me what you can get Johnny writes in from Auckland New Zealand I was in Australia oh sorry a plan to New Zealand writes in and says to Pokemon bleed um yeah you it's funny cuz Johnny this question was in slack and I said yeah of course Pokemon bleed remember they it happens in the very first Pokemon anime episode when the Spiro attack Ash and Pikachu and then but doesn't be a rush scratched yeah my clearly it was more violent in my head and it was yeah in real life I just I thought I didn't think he was bleeding but I thought this like the scratches and scuffs also had like a red behind them but I used more dirty than anything Pikachu it depends on the Canon you're looking at in the Canon of the manga I believe they do because like Pokemon I'm wrong as very is very is very violent yes but I do not believe they do in any of the quarter series or how they ever have they ever referenced blood or anything in in the in the sense of like working in the lab and having like genetics or anything medically related has has that word even been said well I mean they have the reference genetics obviously because they have the DNA splicers but I think what Steve is asking is in those references to genetics do they have a reference specifically the sanguine fluid right of like oh like pokemon blood like you walk up to a test tube and click on it and it sounds like Pokemon it wouldn't say Pokemon blood but just in all the dialogue all the splicing all the scientists that are in the game that are really bad trainers has just the word ever been said I don't think so one would assume that Pokemon have blood to make them live because they have hearts right why do they have hearts cuz all creatures have our hearts right that's what pumps the blood not every living thing has a heart at plants don't have hearts single-celled organisms don't have hearts a lot of doin two Brits have hearts all of them is an octopus an invertebrate yes which is terrible at biology back to them with us well get a biologist on next week no we won't don't promise that we'll get one more email um we have so many emails I'm sorry for I'm just kind of skipping around so I haven't gotten to your email standby all right will do Daniel from hurricane Utah the real question is is hurricane replace the name their place there's a PS here the pronunciation the pronunciation of my hometown hurricane is pronounced her I can not and not hurricane like it's spelled huh her I can her I can that's not as cool sure I can in her I can only these puns can you get on the armor ready haha hello Daniel from her I can Utah longtime listener first-time writer I listened to the podcast just about all day long at work and by far it's super effective is the best said that sends it's weird but you get the gist I have taken a break from playing pokemon for some time now I really enjoyed playing Sunday moon with it I really enjoyed playing Pokemon Sun but came to a point in the game where I just had little desire to go back into it probably the 3ds my assumption I also had the same problem with Final Fantasy 7 I know it's a great game but I can't push myself past certain parts in these games that are less exciting have you ever experienced this feeling with Pokemon or any other game series you love if so did you push back the quote boring part and if you did how did you get yourself past that part to enjoy the rest of the game also pick a number between one through a hundred and the one who guesses closest to the number I am thinking of is my favorite host on the podcast thanks for the time you put into the podcast a fan of the show Daniel I hit a wall during my playthrough of Pocket Monsters white 2 version but then I had to finish it because I'm on a podcast where I'm supposed to know the things about a Pokemon game to be able to talk about them so I finished it out of a sense of duty to my people and my listeners what was the other question there's another one before the number one any games any games in a series or any in just any game that was boring that you felt you had to push yourself past to enjoy the rest of the game hmm game yeah Chrono Trigger is it's up there in terms of what my favorite game is Chrono Trigger is one of them there are worlds and crit like you fought the distant future the not the like end of time future but they but the post-apocalypse future something about the grime enos of it and how much of it is dungeon crawling I never find myself enjoying it and the fact that it's like the second time period of the game always makes it a bit of a slog but I really loved the rest of the game so I always have to push through that but I just know how much I like that game and how much I like its music so I always find a way to break on through to the other side I'm trying to think of a game but I Magikarp just oh boy you didn't hear me okay about that when we were on break well you know I did what you asked me to I I did play it every day for the past week and wow that has just cemented my hatred of that game so much so yeah is what you give it up on it I mean I'm not telling you you need to play it I'm just curious well to town I feel like it I just felt like it was a game that fit into your routine and I was I was curious about the between like why it wasn't hitting some trigger point that these other mobile ish Pokemon games do because there's no pleasure in it at all and you know using the word routine is like so appropriate because this is what I was telling Travis I was like to me playing Magikarp jump is like being a little kid and your mom says oh we have to go to the bank and so you get in the car and you're sitting in the car driving to the bank and then you go to the bank with your mom and you're there at the bank and she's doing bank stuff too Ching all right something happened then you get back in the car and you go home and that's about as exciting as magikarp job gets for me right sometimes you need a sucker at the bank I didn't know what banks you went to but in New York there were no lollipops yeah no it's it's a loading screen I tap something I either succeed or fail and then it's another loading screen and it's the same cutscene I've seen five hundred times and it's so boring I know nomal it let's take a look let's take a left turn Travis used to play magic rope jump much to my own Trigorin given that I've basically done all of it that like I enjoyed it as I mentioned in the first episode of the podcast after it came out that I enjoyed playing it at first now I keep playing it out of like the zombie of the fun that I had before I'm not really enjoying it anymore it's it because it's by its nature incredibly repetitive yeah I still play it once or twice today going back to Daniels question is there a game games that you just can't push back because you know they're boring or they're rough or whatnot oh yeah um like literally every 3d Zelda with the exception of breath of the wild that's that's the main reason that I don't like Zelda games is because 3ds all the games specifically because when they get to the point where I'm frustrated it's like it's it feels like the level is designed to make me hate every minute I'm spending in it making me like restart areas if I make a slight mistake or puzzles that make no intuitive sense or things like that and then I give up and I look I've barely made a dent in this game and I won't push past it but breath of the wild is much better at that virtually every through every two all the game I've played I actually have enjoyed but don't please forget that so I can continue the bit that I do on the show where Zelda is awful I have a lot of games where I get to a point where it the game itself is not enjoyable or I get to the point where I'm satisfied with my experience and I don't have any more time to invest on it into it and I move on I can give a lot of examples but I'll just give like persona 5 for an example I put about 36 hours into that game and I got to the third a big third dungeon slash castle and I think there are seven in that game spoiler and I didn't stop because it was too difficult I didn't stop because it was frustrating I stopped because I didn't have enough time it was right before a bunch of conventions that came up I think c2e2 was the main one and there was enough time passed where now it feels awkward to go back to it like I don't know where I would even start or where to pick up but that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy the time I put into it and I felt like I got my money's worth out of that game referring specifically to Pokemon I think it's well known on the show that I did not finish black 2 and I didn't finish Omega Ruby alpha sapphire ironically both remakes of that well black to quote-unquote you know kind of the same area same stuff news story both both giving me the bin here done that attitude that I didn't really enjoy what broke me specifically of Pokemon Sun when I was playing it was trying to catch taboo lele everything up to that point I found pretty enjoyable there might have been one or two little sluggish parts I think the two mountains back-to-back not good in retrospect I don't know why they decided to do that trying to catch Tabu lele because I was I was on a luxury ball high loved the luxury ball go to ball the the L to the B it's a big luxury ball hi so trying to catch top Ola in a luxury ball was probably the most frustrating thing I've ever experienced in any Pokemon game you're at one HP you're asleep and I've wasted 56 luxury balls and I what what else am I supposed to do this is kind of an ultra ball use a timer ball use a ball that will actually catch the Pokemon so you can stop complaining about how hard they are to catch you're right I could use an Ultra Ball I could probably use the quick ball and caught it on turn one but for me that Pokemon is going straight into my bank I caught every other top ooh / legendary Pokemon up to this point with a luxury ball just wanted in the luxury ball and that's not fun I don't know how they make that experience better but anyways that is what broke me from Sun and Moon and that's ultimately why I stopped playing I recently went back to Sun and Moon a week ago actually the the night or two after I finished the podcast and I opened up my game and I was right in front of Taku Lele I shout out to Kevin who bred me a maybe he didn't bring me maybe he maybe he he took it from another person but shout out to Kevin he gave me a pair of sect with spore and false wipe and a couple of the moves but I'm gonna I cannot this that my train of thought is I cannot not catch this Pokemon I I cannot let myself walk away and just leave this endeavor behind I need to catch taboo Lele before I can actually enjoy the rest of Pokemon and I did I finally did it took another 56 luxury balls and I caught it and then I moved on to tappable bulu and then I moved on to whatever the last one was finis because I already had top of cocoa uh and it it took a whole night and I now have all four Pappu's all in luxury balls and it feels really good and now I feel like I can go back to Pokemon Sun and feel comfortable yeah I feel comfortable now I feel like I can now enjoy the rest of that game but boy that it that experience was just so frustrating and I totally get why people drop off from that and why people move on to different games and I don't I don't know if I have an answer to like how you enjoy that for me enjoying it was to finally catch Taku Lele it was extremely frustrating until it was done and now I I feel very relieved that will do it for our emails but I will say speaking of games I don't enjoy I did play a little bit of played a little bit of black too recently I don't know if we'll saw that oh I did text will very angrily the other night that is correct catching pokémon and black 2 also not fun from what I read online it is harder to catch pokemon in black 2 than it wasn't black I don't know if that's true accurate or what the numbers are but it is very frustrating to catch pokemon in that game and and for example I feel like in Pokemon Sun and Moon I feel like every time you throw a Pokeball or a quick ball or a great ball just a normal ball I feel like almost every time you can pretty much catch that Pokemon on turn 0 or turn 1 whatever you want to call it lapsim you can't yeah but like no I get your point I just think it's funny because we were just talking about how difficult it was for you to catch all the tapas and the luxury balls yeah but I feel like the longer the battle goes on the harder is to catch because that I think there is an increased catch rate on the first turn if you do the first on the very first turn there is an entry for you at s direct that must not exist in black 2 because I couldn't catch anything on turn 0 but anyways I beat Scylla and black 2 and I made it to undulate áown so I made progress in black 2 the only reason I started playing black 2 is because I after this whole diamond and pearl talk that we had last week I went back and put diamond and pearl in I put eye on pearl it booted up just fine ran around with my little running shoes I went to my PC and then I saw that I had some of the the they're not fairies what are they spirits let's pray yeah must spread as often you see are the lake spirits yeah or the lake the lake spirits I noticed I had the lake guardians in my PC box and I was like these need to get moved over to Pokemon pink I don't know how to do this I heard that people said it was a sure uh it's extremely easy uh so I had to put in my copy of black one putting my copy of black one went to the lower research center which actually I was already standing by grabbed Ashley enough grabbed Irene's DS turned on display and then you have to do that minigame where you have to catch the Pokemon which I heard was time-consuming and not fun I wouldn't say it's fun it's probably more fun the magikarps jump but it's what I'm consuming when you have to do like a whole games worth see I didn't think so it took me eight minutes to do 26 Pokemon yeah but I think the most of the people that are complaining about that are like I am bringing up every Pokemon I have in this cartridge all like 20 boxes worth yet 649 minus 150 is what 400 and 399 something like that or Pinot 499 I bet less than 1% of Pokemon players had 399 Pokemon that they moved from Diamond and Pearl to black sure but those players are going to be more vocal than anyone else because there's a white Pokemon a whole bunch so once it's in black though the bank just sucks it right up so there's no more there's nothing the only thing you would have to do in black is put those Pokemon in the very first box and then Bank sucks up the first box can we do poke them out of the week before I have to go yeah well thanks hey Travis I played some old Pokemon I wanted to talk about it I told you I had until 4:30 its 431 Steve give me the poke models I wanna I do want to thank you for being for moving things around in your schedule to accommodate me I appreciate I didn't realize what time it was I was so into engrained in my story ah hey what's a Pokemon our program of the week this week is Bastide on it is an evolution of the pop the fossil Pokemon shield on from the aforementioned diamonds and pearl gonna feature to movesets the first one is first I'll just say that that you're if you're actually using basket on and VGC in all likelihood you're using it for the move guard split which is a move that averages out the defense and special defense of the user and a target so you can give something that typically has very low defenses very high defenses and then Bastide on ax is a bit of a support Pokemon after you've bulked up another pokemons defenses but the tomb but that being said that too perhaps more interesting move sets that I'll feature are from users in slack the first one comes to us from actually both of these are pretty frequent contributors spoke one of the week this first one is Kevin fast yet on with leftovers with a sassy nature the ability sturdy which is that ability that makes it such that if a move would take out Bastion on from full HP instead survives with 1 HP your EVs are going to be 252 and HP and 252 and special defense with the remaining 4 in defense the moves are going to be stealth rock roar toxic and metal burst perhaps running protect over toxic Kevin says that's sort of half or you know six of one half dozen together which one you want to choose kevin says Bastide on is a pretty solid wall his main role is to mess with the enemy team with roar and then stealth rocks gives you some chip damage by using R or metal burst is like a steel version of counter which Kevin says sort of char that weakness of the fact that Bastide on doesn't really have a lot of offensive potential um so um metal bursts can kind of cover that toxic gives more damage pressure because like we said fast you down lacks it and then protect us is just a very handy move in doubles especially on a pokemon that you're looking to stall out the game with anyway because he with left over as you're gaining it exp and perhaps your partner Pokemon is doing some chip damage while you're protecting the next move set is from Gabe it's best you don this time with a rocky helmet and the ability sturdy again with a sassy nature same Eevee spread as before a similar move set in the sense that both of them have metal burst but actually all of the other moves are going to be different rockslide taunt and wide guard and as Gabe mentions this is more of a support set because you're using moves like wide guard to protect both Pokemon on your side of the field from moves that would hit both of them taunt is just a great support move to be able to shut down Pokemon that are going to do tricky things with not damaging moves metal bursts we already went over and then rockslide is just sometimes you need a move that just does damage with same type attack bonus as rockslide wood with bastion on there we go and trivia here is the wall of the castle in the courtyard Coliseum resembles bastions head and Bastian has the highest defense and special defense and the highest single base stat of all fossil Pokemon and if you get a shiny bastard on it is blue it has like a blue shield faceplate instead of the normal grayish steel faceplate maybe Pokemon that is often forgot about I like it though it's cool some housecleaning real quick here is I started a
