Oh what is up everyone welcome to the 220 third episode of the Pokemon podcast I'm your host SBJ and with me on our fourth of July podcasts I have William Anderson our independence day podcast and I am declaring independence from SBJ our freedom podcast of Pokemon which will be free of all Pokemon there will be no pokemon I'm just kidding we are doing this last minute episode today before I do the American thing and cookout on the grill which I have never done I don't think I've ever cooked on a grill before but you bought a grill no I won a grill I want to grill up my works holiday party last last Christmas so you're gonna grill hamburgers and hotdogs watch some WWE katchafire work very American I we're not going for fireworks what was the reason we're recording on a Monday and not over the weekend is because i was in minnesota for the weekend for a baby shower are you having a baby no no no I I don't even have a joke to go with that no I'm but when we came a week we we came back last night we left Minnesota at 9pm i was like i would rather travel in the middle of the night then try to travel back on fourth of july where traffic could be bad that's a good call that's good call the entire drive there's like fireworks everywhere so we we have I got our firework kick in right there yeah I'm gonna after this I'm going to cook on the grill gonna watch some WWE and yeah that'll be that'll be my fourth of July what about you are our personal ownership of fireworks legal in Wisconsin ah I don't know there are a lot of fireworks stores but i'm not sure what I know you can go in and buy them I don't know you can yes I wouldn't be able to sell them if you couldn't set them off at home haha I don't think you can set them off at home but I think you can do it up north there well like not you can't do in the City of Milwaukee unless you have a permit oh alright no cuz it's like it's weird here because it's legal in DC it's legal in yeah but it's not legal in Maryland so for me it's like if I walk too many blocks down the street then I'm carrying illegal fireworks but no I I mean my I went to the mall today that's my independence day didn't I you kidding you buy fireworks in DC can you light them anywhere yeah at home but not in the national parks either well so what is what is your limit to fireworks I can't imagine you can just send what I don't even know what they're called the one that just kind of explodes with all the colors the North your normal firework you can like a roman candle yeah the kind you stick in the ground and it like shoots up sparks in different colors a roman candle that kind of thing that's perfectly legal the little crackers that go pop pop pop pop pop those are legal sparklers sure mmm but the kind that you shoot up into the air now mortars no okay yeah yeah yeah yeah I don't know if I think sparklers might be illegal in the City of Milwaukee I don't know but we got its fourth of July episode recording it now it'll be up hopefully later tonight when if you're hearing our voices now you're listening to it as we speak this is the 220 third episode as we are recording this there are nationals is still going on for my understanding i went to pokemon championships calm there was a stream there are still people playing the TCG some winners have been announced but we'll probably talk about all of that on the next episode because i don't have access to just a list of winners and what Dex and or which pokemon they used but i think wilsa was saying before the episode that everyone was using xerneas and Kyogre groudon crowd out on xerneas smeargle those that that's just the core of every team it's gonna like back in the old days when it used to be metagross cresselia okay yep mmm that every shy of the same team all shiny all perfect ivs the standard pokemon competitive trip now I didn't get I didn't get a chance to watch the Nationals because I've been sick all weekend so I thought they were shiny or not I I was traveling mostly weekend I left Friday night when most of it's why I watched a little bit Friday morning because i was at work finishing up some stuff I had it on I'm very good to see people like Aaron zhang and jwittz and Kyle pooka sue kovitch all great people there's some other there were some other commentators on the stream that I think were were there last year over the years before but good to see those three I enjoy all three of those guys but I watched a little bit then I was traveling so I didn't get a catch much after that but I pokémon does a real good job at keeping like the Twitter and everything up to date saying like oh this is your winner or hey we're going live or and I think they also empower their commentators to do the same how we saw like Kyle or jwittz tweeting like hey we're about to go live with this game blah blah blah so that was yeah that was just that was just good to see um but for this episode what we're gonna do is we're gonna just focus on the seven new pokemon that were revealed first they revealed in a japanese trailer that came out on thursday and i believe there was some kind of trailer and or announcement that happened on friday i'm not sure if that was specifically at Nationals if they showed a trailer or something but I got a press release from the pokemon company with the English names the types I'm sure if you're listening you've probably already seen all that but we're gonna we're going to talk about those today so we got seven new pokémon do you want to start will with the the two old pokemon they got named the koala and the dog let's start with those hahahaha the dog the dirty dog do the dogs ah no it's rock rough is the dog's name and I think it is one of the most perfect Pokemon names ever it's really good you don't think rough rock would have been better as it I don't know rock rough rock right is it is rock rock yeah i was thinking don't you think rough rock would have been better ah i'm indifferent it's a fun word to say rock ruff ruff yeah that's that's the double our alliteration that makes it so pleasant and the the oh yeah I don't know I I like i'm not i'm not a big dog person I'm a cat person but I correct I like how rock rough looks I also love rock crafts name that is be and that's about all you can save it is he is he just rock type normal normal rock I thought okay so he is well I don't know you've got the press release I do i do i'm pulling it up right now we have oh just rock just rock Randolph has it that's cool rock ref has an excellent sense of smell and once it has smelled an odor it doesn't forget there are tales of these pokémon getting separated from their trainers then using the faintest traits traces of their scent to track them for days until they are reunited that's real nice I think the trailer also showed that Professor Kukui yes has a rock rough I'd like he demos a rock rough for some reason but I don't remember what a what the reason was I think each professor kinda has a Pokemon professor oak a TV right maybe ausa bly the other Pokemon that we saw was the koala which that English name is Kamala yeah like he's in a coma oh no one has ever seen no one has ever seen a koala awake it eats travels and even battles while sound asleep according to ancient people its saliva can be used as a medicine for the sick or sleepless Kamala has a comatose ability that keeps it perpetually in a drowsing state preventing it from getting any other status conditions that's really cool and if you saw the video it like it really wailed on its opponent when it attacked like went to town so did it have the status effects sleeping next to it or not notice no okay i only watch the video once but I had it was like four days ago so no I think it showed that it was like a status effect was tried to be put on it and then um that it showed the ability saying no this can't happen ok Bo sure I don't think it said like status asleep when he came out the first time like how intimidate like flashes across the screen and then yeah and then the stats go down got it got it all right so then the trailer here shows seven new Pokemon I think these are in order of how that when they were revealed first one is taboo cocoa top Oggo oh that's a throwback actually it's Topo Gigio wow only people over 50 years old will understand that reference ok I guess is this the first Pokemon with two words as its name mr. mime ok yep or mime jr. mime jr. yep technically there's isn't there one where it's like the the words are squished together because there was not enough room for a space uh you might be right i know for alligators like missing an e and its name is too long am I saying that right though tapu Coco Coco coco yeah is the guardian of deity of Mel Mel a island when I learned you the Aloha region yellow la región love oh I LOL ya a little trick is that the the term melly means like it's kind of a mistranslation of Mary when it's translated into Hawaiian so Mellie Mellie would mean like Mary Mary like very happy I don't it all right Hawaii facts from will the tips and tricks Sabu Coco's ability is electric surge an ability that which has never been seen before the electric surge ability fills the field around the pokemons feet with electricity when it appears raising the power of any electric-type move for pokemon on the ground and preventing Pokemon from falling asleep this pokémon is electric ferry which i believe is our first electric ferry indirect no dnd DoD did any did any did the King Dedede this is this is not a Kirby the Kirby I've never played a kirby game so I'm glad that I was able to pick that they're pretty simple we have charged a bug charge a bug yep bug electric which hugbug bus the bug bus yeah charge a bug is the first evolution of grubbin a new a lola region Pokemon revealed last month charkhe charger bugs battery ability allows as it allows it to raise the power of allies special move yeah I wonder what that means I want to I want to find out more it's like if they use a special move it automatically gets a power boost or does their special attack get a boost somehow i'm curious about battery ability i might not matter though because it's the middle evolution and no one uses simple solution maybe maybe we'll have a new reason to use charge bug maybe I mean besides new world man besides that it's one of the coolest pokemon ever and it looks like a bus yeah ago well the bus or a square battery yeah anything I like it I think it's cool I think I think that this pokemon is like the trouble of generation 7 and what I mean by that is I think that gen winners or people outside the pokemon community are gonna look at this pokemon and go look it Bo c'mon ran out of ideals but no no it's really cool and those people don't know what they're talking about because Grimer is real lame and that's gin 1 yup with just pile sludge Voltorb is just a pokeball those are so simple and not that simple is bad those are some basic pokemon basic charge bug he ain't basic he's like a double D battery well now he's more like a 9-volt battery but sure all right yeah yeah he has the power of a double D in the shape of a 9-volt these are all good names for Tasha book double d 9 volt charger bug evolves into Vika volt Vika volt Vika volt I'm gonna go with the couple to start with yeah i think i'm going to go with Vika volt because I like saying it all rights bug electric Vika volt the evolution of charge a bug is a is like a fortress that zooms through the forest using its huge jaws to control a beam of electricity when it can fire from its mouth which it can fire from its mouth this is the Dragonfly pokemon or maybe lightning bug know like dragonfly lightning bug it looks like a like a lightning bug beetle kind of Delia cuz its tail kind of has a light to it right it's blue and yellow it's like almost like pincer like claws in the front mandibles mandibles bug terms it's cool I'm sure it's gonna have a doesn't state ability here but I wouldn't it's levitate is it levitated okay I'm gonna say like I it seems like a Pokemon that would have liked moves like extreme speed or more stuff like that charge volt volt switch something different than Galvin Chola write because those are the only other bug electric pokemon I think so don't take my word for it but I believe so we should get some Pokemon experts on the show someday someday someday yeah it's clearly not us grandpa dragon grandpa that is that what the I'm assuming the two words slam together I believe so grandpa are dragons that live up alone in the mountains ten thousand American feet above sea level with grandpa's berserk ability this pokémons special attacks that will go up one when its HP drops below half decent all right is that new that's new no I mean I feel like I'm that's based on a different ability with a different name well yet because it's like torrent and whatever the other ones that the starters get when they're below thirty percent their attack in stats go up but this is at fifty percent so grandpa is the only one that knows it according to bubble bead bulbapedia it also has the second ability of SAP zipper I don't know how they know that already but okay ya know that was announced they well does press release did not inform me of that I was in the video okay yeah it's also interesting because he is a normal dragon so that's that's a first combo there's never been a dragon normal dragon type before which means that it is I think adds additional weakness to fighting type because I don't think dragon has a resistance to fighting type so that's cool but also cannot be hit by ghost type moves oh there you go based on the Chinese dragon according to bola pedia I think we would do a disservice to our listeners if we didn't say that this Pokemon looks kind of like Falkor from the neverending story which is funny because they've recently been featuring Falkor on TV commercial soho is how coincidental did you enjoy that movie cuz I didn't I don't like that movie at all I did not like the movie at all and it's it's you know do I even need to say that the book that it's based on is so much incredibly better than the movie that if you can find a copy of the book the neverending story that I highly recommend going out and getting it because it is so good unlike a movie that lies to me right away clearly the movie hasn't anything well it's not a never ending movie does the neverending story okay that's all right you got me there what next oh this dumb fish man I'm stop do not dare there is some amazing things about Brooks ish that that you're not picking up on alright well let me let me read what what the president lease here says and then enlighten me on brush X the water psychic fish Pokemon brush Ock's emits a strong psychic power from the proto be rinse on its head while grinding its teeth loudly some some Russians have a new dazzling ability that prevents the opponent's from using a priority move that normally strikes first so the ability is called dazzling I think yeah that's the name of it dazzling so we're still debating what that actually means it in bits basically the way they describe it is it prevents priority moves from hitting so that could mean it prevents all priority moves which would mean that protect which gets priority wouldn't hit Gail wings which gives priority wouldn't do anything so anything like that or it could just mean priority moves that caused damage will be immediately blocked by an ability not by a move so that's really cool like fake out yeah fake-out does damage got it okay so you sent me this lick lick lick this blink of hawaii state fish yes so that is the fish that breakfast is based on I want you to pronounce the name of that fish at I'm gonna spell out the name first because I don't think our this is a podcast you can't though our listeners can't see the name of this so but it's more entertaining when you just try haha i want i wanna i want to set up my i want to set up for failure here so this how you spell it is h um uhum un UK un UK you AP you a ' thing a hum you hum on come coo coo ah you know this song is that this fish is featured in a song of a very famous song about hawaii lilo and stitch no all right that was that was my only guess humuhumunukunukuapua'a come on it's so straight forward what now that you said I still don't yeah okay I don't think I could still pronounce that it's it's all repeated words humuhumunukunukuapua'a okay then you come on you've heard I want to go back to my little grass shack in colic ahora Hawaii yeah I was actually watching a simpsons episode last night where Moe wants to take his girlfriend to Hawaii and I remember them saying something like this Hawaii here we come Anana colima Kalani an Onan honolulu hawaii hawaii what about Hawaii mo was going to Hawaii am I really do they say Mahama nuclear it did you go up hoo-hah oh and they said I think so no I think I think they started to sing like a little song but i believe that word was actually in it so i think all breakfast should be named humuhumunukunukuapua'a I don't think you have enough room ah lead out the vowels okay alright so this uh this article says the was this designated as the official state Fish of Hawaii on a five-year trial basis in 1985 when the trial quietly lapse in 1990 no action was taken to either reinstate or d in state a new species it wasn't an eight it wasn't until two thousand six that the notice was taken that Hawaii was without a state Fish and the Hama Hama cuca cuca PO I he was reinstated as the official state fish on a permanent basis it is also called the rectangular tiger fish or the Hawaiian no not tigerfish trigger fish or the Hawaiian triggerfish yeah it is a triggerfish but it's got teeth just like Breck's ish and it's got weird coloring um I've swum with them before I feel like the the brush brush six we we see in the picture is is female I wonder if we're going to get like a male version oh no I think that that's just do you think that's it's gonna be yeah very brightly colored lively I cuz i would like to see the colors match this picture of what you set me what may be the shiny will have those colors yeah it's is really cool for our listeners I can't see it's more of a white black like a dark orange and then a neon yellow I think it's really cool and a little bit of blue a little bit of neon blue in there too yeah yeah brush brush Ock's that's up the basket Lynn of gin 7 no no no because it's got the dazzling ability it's like this is game changer man all right all right ah cutie fly is next which is also a great name good name I think cutie fly is a bug fairy think the first bug fairy I keep saying this but I'm always wrong cutie pie oh I think yet bug fair this cat first bug fairy cutie fly can detect the auras of living things including people pokemon and plants these seek out flowers by cutting the color and the brightness of their auras and then they gather the nectar and pollen I feel like some somewhere I saw that this was a three-stage evolution but I could be wrong oh I don't know I didn't see that I did see that it's based on a real creature another Hawaiian animal I know I not specifically Hawaiian but it's a kind of a fly that is invades bees nests and leaves its larvae and bees nests to kill the bees ah well they steal resources from the bee larva so the thick kind of like you know how a cuckoo will lay its egg in other birds nests mm-hmm it's your long listen no that's right that before cuckoo birds lay their eggs and other birds nests so that those other birds can raise their young for them but so yeah but it actually looks kind of like a fuzzy be looking thing but it's actually a fly if you look it's real cute I mean the real ones real cute even if it's nefarious and its reproductive practices all right the bulbapedia article says they can learn a move called fairy wind well I mean most fairy types can learn fairy wind so that's not that exciting all right I thought we got going all right what we got next here we have last one in butcher the name togi day marty Maru I mean that's close its kind of based on the same as Togepi Soto get damaru toget okay toga damaru is a rollie pollie pokemon that is literally what it says is the roly-poly pokemon that gathers electricity and stores it the long needle that grows from its back of its head works as a lightning rod to attract electricity here is your Pikachu of gin 7 yeah so I love hedgehogs and it's a real hedgehog it's real cute yeah yeah so we have Pikachu we have Plusle and minun and uh Jen 20 a was that Miss from gentoo we I'll go back to that we have Pachirisu Emolga did any did any it was gin too he chew Pete nuh Pichu yeah yeah Peter does like count no it does because I was having this discussion with one of our listeners and and maybe this is something that other folks can write in about where the electric rodent type is kind of a signifier of a new aspect that's introduced in that generation so he was like yeah I saw an article about that yeah so then he was wondering what toad toga damaru indicates about jen 7 which I couldn't think anything hahaha or or even what you know Pachirisu or emolga depicted for their generation so i am not sure that that I I saw that I was like they're really stretching here because I think Pachirisu was supposed to mean like the nintendo Wi-Fi network because it matched the colors i guess white and blue and then the people were they were saying that Plusle and minun represented double battles hatchery see was the nintendo Wi-Fi network which was kind of a stretch they said a moga represented a refreshed or red and blue based on its colors or something and i was like now that kind of a strike in white now yeah yeah and then what was after Emolga dedenne dedenne represented ferry because gen-6 introduced ferry and i was like oh okay yeah sure that that one lines up I don't I don't know it's it's it's funny how like many theories or how like people like are stretching I just think people are stretching a lot for attention like look at what this kind of represents and I you see that a lot and all of it that's like exclusive to pokemon but it's fun but it's also like yeah i think you you're overthinking this your cliq baiting friends yeah yeah i was just leading your own life it was it was it just goes back to like people thinking ditto and you or like ditto is a failed mule own or something like that because they have the same weight in the same color in the same shiny and then when they asked masuda about it he was like I've never heard that before it was like yeah I think you guys were stretching this a little thin it's fun for a minute but those are your seven new Pokemon and you're too old pokemon that now have english names so far so far i'm really happy with the everything they've shown yeah I am I was having a discussion with somebody else as well about why it appears there's so many electric types um with you know top you Coco also being electric and my what I'm going to guess at this point to add wild speculation to all those wild speculations that you just sat down is that each island might be a focal point for a particular type so Mellie Mellie island is a focal point for electric types and then maybe other islands will have sort of more common a particular type of you get what I'm saying pokemon on that island based on whatever the island guardian is yes yeah so did they say Five Islands I know it was a number of islands and then one artificial island because they keep trying to make that one feel bad because it's not a natural Island right okay the alala region is supposed to be made up of four main islands in one artificial island yep keep keep putting that out making that guy feel bad yep you know that island didn't ask to be an artificial island and you know what it's an island just the same as all the other islands no matter how it was created and where it came from and I think we should just treat it like an island like it deserves to be treated sale or artificial as of this recording there are 18 currently new Pokemon that brings our total to 302 739 Pokemon in the pokédex we have at least six new moves at least ten new abilities I'm sure only more will be added to the roster but yeah oh yeah those are 150 more hundred fifty-one that's a lot we still don't have any news
