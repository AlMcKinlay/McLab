the reason we're recording on a Monday (1:18 - 1:23)

in and buy them I don't know you can yes (2:10 - 2:14)
I wouldn't be able to sell them if you (2:12 - 2:17)
couldn't set them off at home haha I (2:14 - 2:20)
don't think you can set them off at home (2:17 - 2:24)
but I think you can do it up north there (2:20 - 2:26)
well like not you can't do in the City (2:24 - 2:28)
of Milwaukee unless you have a permit oh (2:26 - 2:30)
alright no cuz it's like it's weird here (2:28 - 2:33)
because it's legal in DC it's legal in (2:30 - 2:35)
yeah but it's not legal in Maryland so (2:33 - 2:37)
for me it's like if I walk too many (2:35 - 2:40)
blocks down the street then I'm carrying (2:37 - 2:44)
illegal fireworks but no I I mean my I (2:40 - 2:45)

don't even know what they're called the (2:59 - 3:02)
one that just kind of explodes with all (3:00 - 3:03)
the colors the North your normal (3:02 - 3:06)
firework you can like a roman candle (3:03 - 3:08)

and it like shoots up sparks in (3:08 - 3:11)
different colors a roman candle that (3:09 - 3:13)

Friday morning because i was at work (4:49 - 4:53)
finishing up some stuff I had it on I'm (4:50 - 4:55)

all great people there's some other (4:59 - 5:02)

those guys but I watched a little bit (5:10 - 5:15)
then I was traveling so I didn't get a (5:13 - 5:18)
catch much after that but I pokémon does (5:15 - 5:20)
a real good job at keeping like the (5:18 - 5:22)
Twitter and everything up to date saying (5:20 - 5:24)
like oh this is your winner or hey we're (5:22 - 5:27)
going live or and I think they also (5:24 - 5:29)
empower their commentators to do the (5:27 - 5:32)
same how we saw like Kyle or jwittz (5:29 - 5:34)
tweeting like hey we're about to go live (5:32 - 5:36)
with this game blah blah blah so that (5:34 - 5:38)
was yeah that was just that was just (5:36 - 5:42)
good to see um but for this episode what (5:38 - 5:44)
we're gonna do is we're gonna just focus (5:42 - 5:46)
on the seven new pokemon that were (5:44 - 5:49)
revealed first they revealed in a (5:46 - 5:51)
japanese trailer that came out on (5:49 - 5:54)
thursday and i believe there was some (5:51 - 5:57)
kind of trailer and or announcement that (5:54 - 5:59)
happened on friday i'm not sure if that (5:57 - 6:01)
was specifically at Nationals if they (5:59 - 6:03)
showed a trailer or something but I got (6:01 - 6:04)
a press release from the pokemon company (6:03 - 6:08)
with the English names the types I'm (6:04 - 6:10)
sure if you're listening you've probably (6:08 - 6:11)
already seen all that but we're gonna (6:10 - 6:14)
we're going to talk about those today so (6:11 - 6:16)
we got seven new pokémon do you want to (6:14 - 6:19)
start will with the the two old pokemon (6:16 - 6:22)
they got named the koala and the dog (6:19 - 6:26)
let's start with those hahahaha the dog (6:22 - 6:33)
the dirty dog do the dogs ah no it's (6:26 - 6:33)
rock rough is the dog's name and I think (6:33 - 6:40)
it is one of the most perfect Pokemon (6:37 - 6:42)
names ever it's really good you don't (6:40 - 6:44)
think rough rock would have been better (6:42 - 6:47)
as it I don't know rock rough rock right (6:44 - 6:48)
is it is rock rock yeah i was thinking (6:47 - 6:50)
don't you think rough rock would have (6:48 - 6:55)
been better ah i'm indifferent it's a (6:50 - 6:57)
fun word to say rock ruff ruff (6:55 - 7:00)
yeah that's that's the double our (6:57 - 7:03)
alliteration that makes it so pleasant (7:00 - 7:07)
and the the oh yeah I don't know I I (7:03 - 7:10)
like i'm not i'm not a big dog person (7:07 - 7:13)
I'm a cat person but I correct I like (7:10 - 7:16)
how rock rough looks I also love rock (7:13 - 7:20)
crafts name that is be and that's about (7:16 - 7:22)
all you can save it is he is he just (7:20 - 7:26)
rock type normal normal rock I thought (7:22 - 7:28)
okay so he is well I don't know you've (7:26 - 7:30)
got the press release I do i do i'm (7:28 - 7:33)
pulling it up right now we have oh just (7:30 - 7:37)
rock just rock Randolph has it that's (7:33 - 7:39)
cool rock ref has an excellent sense of (7:37 - 7:41)
smell and once it has smelled an odor it (7:39 - 7:44)
doesn't forget there are tales of these (7:41 - 7:45)
pokémon getting separated from their (7:44 - 7:48)
trainers then using the faintest traits (7:45 - 7:51)
traces of their scent to track them for (7:48 - 7:54)
days until they are reunited that's real (7:51 - 7:56)
nice I think the trailer also showed (7:54 - 8:00)
that Professor Kukui yes has a rock (7:56 - 8:03)
rough I'd like he demos a rock rough for (8:00 - 8:05)
some reason but I don't remember what a (8:03 - 8:07)
what the reason was I think each (8:05 - 8:10)
professor kinda has a Pokemon professor (8:07 - 8:18)
oak a TV right maybe ausa bly the other (8:10 - 8:23)
Pokemon that we saw was the koala which (8:18 - 8:27)
that English name is Kamala yeah like (8:23 - 8:31)
he's in a coma oh no one has ever seen (8:27 - 8:34)
no one has ever seen a koala awake it (8:31 - 8:37)
eats travels and even battles while (8:34 - 8:40)
sound asleep according to ancient people (8:37 - 8:43)
its saliva can be used as a medicine for (8:40 - 8:47)
the sick or sleepless Kamala has a (8:43 - 8:49)
comatose ability that keeps it (8:47 - 8:53)
perpetually in a drowsing state (8:49 - 8:55)
preventing it from getting any other (8:53 - 8:58)
status conditions that's really cool and (8:55 - 9:00)
if you saw the video it like it really (8:58 - 9:04)
wailed on its opponent when it attacked (9:00 - 9:07)
like went to town so did it have the (9:04 - 9:09)
status effects sleeping next to it or (9:07 - 9:10)
not notice (9:09 - 9:13)
no okay i only watch the video once but (9:10 - 9:16)
I had it was like four days ago so no I (9:13 - 9:18)
think it showed that it was like a (9:16 - 9:21)
status effect was tried to be put on it (9:18 - 9:25)
and then um that it showed the ability (9:21 - 9:29)
saying no this can't happen ok Bo sure I (9:25 - 9:31)
don't think it said like status asleep (9:29 - 9:34)
when he came out the first time like how (9:31 - 9:36)
intimidate like flashes across the (9:34 - 9:39)
screen and then yeah and then the stats (9:36 - 9:41)
go down got it got it all right so then (9:39 - 9:45)
the trailer here shows seven new Pokemon (9:41 - 9:47)
I think these are in order of how that (9:45 - 9:50)
when they were revealed first one is (9:47 - 9:54)
taboo cocoa top Oggo oh that's a (9:50 - 9:59)
throwback actually it's Topo Gigio wow (9:54 - 10:01)
only people over 50 years old will (9:59 - 10:05)
understand that reference ok I guess is (10:01 - 10:09)
this the first Pokemon with two words as (10:05 - 10:14)
its name mr. mime ok yep or mime jr. (10:09 - 10:18)
mime jr. yep technically there's isn't (10:14 - 10:19)
there one where it's like the the words (10:18 - 10:22)
are squished together because there was (10:19 - 10:25)
not enough room for a space uh you might (10:22 - 10:26)
be right i know for alligators like (10:25 - 10:30)
missing an e and its name is too long am (10:26 - 10:32)
I saying that right though tapu Coco (10:30 - 10:36)
Coco coco yeah is the guardian of deity (10:32 - 10:41)
of Mel Mel a island when I learned you (10:36 - 10:44)
the Aloha region yellow la región love (10:41 - 10:48)
oh I LOL ya a little trick is that the (10:44 - 10:51)
the term melly means like it's kind of a (10:48 - 10:54)
mistranslation of Mary when it's (10:51 - 10:56)
translated into Hawaiian so Mellie (10:54 - 10:59)
Mellie would mean like Mary Mary like (10:56 - 11:02)
very happy I don't it all right Hawaii (10:59 - 11:05)
facts from will the tips and tricks Sabu (11:02 - 11:09)
Coco's ability is electric surge an (11:05 - 11:10)
ability that which has never been seen (11:09 - 11:13)
before the electric surge ability fills (11:10 - 11:17)
the field around the pokemons feet with (11:13 - 11:19)
electricity when it appears raising the (11:17 - 11:22)
power of any electric-type move for (11:19 - 11:24)
pokemon on the ground (11:22 - 11:26)
and preventing Pokemon from falling (11:24 - 11:30)
asleep this pokémon is electric ferry (11:26 - 11:32)
which i believe is our first electric (11:30 - 11:36)
ferry indirect no dnd DoD did any did (11:32 - 11:42)
any did the King Dedede this is this is (11:36 - 11:46)
not a Kirby the Kirby I've never played (11:42 - 11:48)
a kirby game so I'm glad that I was able (11:46 - 11:50)
to pick that they're pretty simple we (11:48 - 11:53)
have charged a bug charge a bug yep bug (11:50 - 11:57)
electric which hugbug bus the bug bus (11:53 - 12:01)
yeah charge a bug is the first evolution (11:57 - 12:05)
of grubbin a new a lola region Pokemon (12:01 - 12:09)
revealed last month charkhe charger bugs (12:05 - 12:12)
battery ability allows as it allows it (12:09 - 12:15)
to raise the power of allies special (12:12 - 12:17)
move yeah I wonder what that means I (12:15 - 12:18)
want to I want to find out more it's (12:17 - 12:20)
like if they use a special move it (12:18 - 12:23)
automatically gets a power boost or does (12:20 - 12:25)
their special attack get a boost somehow (12:23 - 12:28)
i'm curious about battery ability i (12:25 - 12:30)
might not matter though because it's the (12:28 - 12:32)
middle evolution and no one uses simple (12:30 - 12:35)
solution maybe maybe we'll have a new (12:32 - 12:37)
reason to use charge bug maybe I mean (12:35 - 12:40)
besides new world man besides that it's (12:37 - 12:42)
one of the coolest pokemon ever and it (12:40 - 12:45)
looks like a bus yeah ago well the bus (12:42 - 12:48)
or a square battery yeah anything I like (12:45 - 12:50)
it I think it's cool I think I think (12:48 - 12:53)
that this pokemon is like the trouble of (12:50 - 12:56)
generation 7 and what I mean by that is (12:53 - 12:59)
I think that gen winners or people (12:56 - 13:01)
outside the pokemon community are gonna (12:59 - 13:03)
look at this pokemon and go look it Bo (13:01 - 13:08)
c'mon ran out of ideals but no no it's (13:03 - 13:10)
really cool and those people don't know (13:08 - 13:11)
what they're talking about because (13:10 - 13:14)
Grimer is real lame and that's gin 1 yup (13:11 - 13:17)
with just pile sludge Voltorb is just a (13:14 - 13:21)
pokeball those are so simple and not (13:17 - 13:23)
that simple is bad those are some basic (13:21 - 13:27)
pokemon basic charge bug he ain't basic (13:23 - 13:30)
he's like a double D battery well now (13:27 - 13:32)
he's more like a 9-volt battery but sure (13:30 - 13:34)
all right yeah yeah he has the power of (13:32 - 13:37)
a double D in the shape of a 9-volt (13:34 - 13:39)
these are all good names for Tasha book (13:37 - 13:43)
double d 9 volt charger bug evolves into (13:39 - 13:49)
Vika volt Vika volt Vika volt I'm gonna (13:43 - 13:55)
go with the couple to start with yeah i (13:49 - 13:56)
think i'm going to go with Vika volt (13:55 - 13:59)
because I like saying it all rights bug (13:56 - 14:02)
electric Vika volt the evolution of (13:59 - 14:05)
charge a bug is a is like a fortress (14:02 - 14:08)
that zooms through the forest using its (14:05 - 14:11)
huge jaws to control a beam of (14:08 - 14:14)
electricity when it can fire from its (14:11 - 14:15)
mouth which it can fire from its mouth (14:14 - 14:20)
this is the Dragonfly pokemon or maybe (14:15 - 14:22)
lightning bug know like dragonfly (14:20 - 14:25)
lightning bug it looks like a like a (14:22 - 14:29)
lightning bug beetle kind of Delia cuz (14:25 - 14:31)
its tail kind of has a light to it right (14:29 - 14:35)
it's blue and yellow it's like almost (14:31 - 14:37)
like pincer like claws in the front (14:35 - 14:41)
mandibles mandibles bug terms it's cool (14:37 - 14:44)
I'm sure it's gonna have a doesn't state (14:41 - 14:46)
ability here but I wouldn't it's (14:44 - 14:48)
levitate is it levitated okay I'm gonna (14:46 - 14:50)
say like I it seems like a Pokemon that (14:48 - 14:52)
would have liked moves like extreme (14:50 - 14:55)
speed or more stuff like that charge (14:52 - 14:58)
volt volt switch something different (14:55 - 15:01)
than Galvin Chola write because those (14:58 - 15:03)
are the only other bug electric pokemon (15:01 - 15:07)
I think so don't take my word for it but (15:03 - 15:09)
I believe so we should get some Pokemon (15:07 - 15:13)
experts on the show someday someday (15:09 - 15:16)
someday yeah it's clearly not us grandpa (15:13 - 15:19)
dragon grandpa that is that what the I'm (15:16 - 15:21)
assuming the two words slam together I (15:19 - 15:24)
believe so grandpa are dragons that live (15:21 - 15:28)
up alone in the mountains ten thousand (15:24 - 15:31)
American feet above sea level with (15:28 - 15:34)
grandpa's berserk ability this pokémons (15:31 - 15:37)
special attacks that will go up one when (15:34 - 15:41)
its HP drops below half decent all right (15:37 - 15:45)
is that new that's new no (15:41 - 15:48)
I mean I feel like I'm that's based on a (15:45 - 15:50)
different ability with a different name (15:48 - 15:53)
well yet because it's like torrent and (15:50 - 15:54)
whatever the other ones that the (15:53 - 15:57)
starters get when they're below thirty (15:54 - 16:01)
percent their attack in stats go up but (15:57 - 16:04)
this is at fifty percent so grandpa is (16:01 - 16:07)
the only one that knows it according to (16:04 - 16:09)
bubble bead bulbapedia it also has the (16:07 - 16:11)
second ability of SAP zipper I don't (16:09 - 16:13)
know how they know that already but okay (16:11 - 16:15)
ya know that was announced they well (16:13 - 16:17)
does press release did not inform me of (16:15 - 16:22)
that I was in the video okay yeah it's (16:17 - 16:26)
also interesting because he is a normal (16:22 - 16:30)
dragon so that's that's a first combo (16:26 - 16:33)
there's never been a dragon normal (16:30 - 16:37)
dragon type before which means that it (16:33 - 16:40)
is I think adds additional weakness to (16:37 - 16:43)
fighting type because I don't think (16:40 - 16:45)
dragon has a resistance to fighting type (16:43 - 16:49)
so that's cool but also cannot be hit by (16:45 - 16:52)
ghost type moves oh there you go based (16:49 - 16:55)
on the Chinese dragon according to bola (16:52 - 16:58)
pedia I think we would do a disservice (16:55 - 17:01)
to our listeners if we didn't say that (16:58 - 17:04)
this Pokemon looks kind of like Falkor (17:01 - 17:06)
from the neverending story which is (17:04 - 17:07)
funny because they've recently been (17:06 - 17:11)
featuring Falkor on TV commercial soho (17:07 - 17:16)
is how coincidental did you enjoy that (17:11 - 17:18)
movie cuz I didn't I don't like that (17:16 - 17:20)
movie at all I did not like the movie at (17:18 - 17:24)
all and it's it's you know do I even (17:20 - 17:26)
need to say that the book that it's (17:24 - 17:29)
based on is so much incredibly better (17:26 - 17:33)
than the movie that if you can find a (17:29 - 17:36)
copy of the book the neverending story (17:33 - 17:39)
that I highly recommend going out and (17:36 - 17:41)
getting it because it is so good unlike (17:39 - 17:42)
a movie that lies to me right away (17:41 - 17:46)
clearly the movie hasn't anything well (17:42 - 17:48)
it's not a never ending movie does the (17:46 - 17:50)
neverending story okay that's all right (17:48 - 17:55)
you got me there what next oh this dumb (17:50 - 17:58)
fish man I'm stop do not dare (17:55 - 17:59)
there is some amazing things about (17:58 - 18:02)
Brooks ish that that you're not picking (17:59 - 18:04)
up on alright well let me let me read (18:02 - 18:06)
what what the president lease here says (18:04 - 18:09)
and then enlighten me on brush X the (18:06 - 18:12)
water psychic fish Pokemon brush Ock's (18:09 - 18:16)
emits a strong psychic power from the (18:12 - 18:19)
proto be rinse on its head while (18:16 - 18:22)
grinding its teeth loudly some some (18:19 - 18:24)
Russians have a new dazzling ability (18:22 - 18:26)
that prevents the opponent's from using (18:24 - 18:29)
a priority move that normally strikes (18:26 - 18:32)
first so the ability is called dazzling (18:29 - 18:34)
I think yeah that's the name of it (18:32 - 18:37)
dazzling so we're still debating what (18:34 - 18:39)
that actually means it in bits basically (18:37 - 18:42)
the way they describe it is it prevents (18:39 - 18:45)
priority moves from hitting so that (18:42 - 18:47)
could mean it prevents all priority (18:45 - 18:50)
moves which would mean that protect (18:47 - 18:52)
which gets priority wouldn't hit Gail (18:50 - 18:54)
wings which gives priority wouldn't do (18:52 - 18:58)
anything so anything like that or it (18:54 - 18:59)
could just mean priority moves that (18:58 - 19:01)
caused damage will be immediately (18:59 - 19:03)
blocked by an ability not by a move so (19:01 - 19:06)
that's really cool like fake out yeah (19:03 - 19:09)
fake-out does damage got it okay so you (19:06 - 19:12)
sent me this lick lick lick this blink (19:09 - 19:16)
of hawaii state fish yes so that is the (19:12 - 19:19)
fish that breakfast is based on I want (19:16 - 19:20)
you to pronounce the name of that fish (19:19 - 19:24)
at I'm gonna spell out the name first (19:20 - 19:27)
because I don't think our this is a (19:24 - 19:29)
podcast you can't though our listeners (19:27 - 19:32)

a very famous song about hawaii lilo and (20:02 - 20:09)
stitch no all right that was that was my (20:06 - 20:10)
only guess (20:09 - 20:15)
humuhumunukunukuapua'a come on it's so (20:10 - 20:19)
straight forward what now that you said (20:15 - 20:22)
I still don't yeah okay I don't think I (20:19 - 20:26)
could still pronounce that it's it's all (20:22 - 20:28)
repeated words humuhumunukunukuapua'a (20:26 - 20:31)
okay then you come on you've heard I (20:28 - 20:32)
want to go back to my little grass shack (20:31 - 20:35)
in colic ahora Hawaii yeah I was (20:32 - 20:37)
actually watching a simpsons episode (20:35 - 20:39)
last night where Moe wants to take his (20:37 - 20:42)
girlfriend to Hawaii and I remember them (20:39 - 20:44)
saying something like this Hawaii here (20:42 - 20:47)

think I think they started to sing like (21:02 - 21:06)
a little song but i believe that word (21:04 - 21:08)
was actually in it so i think all (21:06 - 21:09)
breakfast should be named (21:08 - 21:12)
humuhumunukunukuapua'a I don't think you (21:09 - 21:15)
have enough room ah lead out the vowels (21:12 - 21:19)
okay alright so this uh this article (21:15 - 21:22)
says the was this designated as the (21:19 - 21:24)
official state Fish of Hawaii on a (21:22 - 21:28)
five-year trial basis in 1985 when the (21:24 - 21:31)
trial quietly lapse in 1990 no action (21:28 - 21:34)
was taken to either reinstate or d in (21:31 - 21:36)
state a new species it wasn't an eight (21:34 - 21:40)
it wasn't until two thousand six that (21:36 - 21:41)
the notice was taken that Hawaii was (21:40 - 21:44)
without a state Fish and the Hama Hama (21:41 - 21:50)
cuca cuca PO I he was reinstated as the (21:44 - 21:53)
official state fish on a permanent basis (21:50 - 21:57)
it is also called the rectangular tiger (21:53 - 22:01)
fish or the Hawaiian no not tigerfish (21:57 - 22:04)
trigger fish or the Hawaiian triggerfish (22:01 - 22:06)
yeah it is a triggerfish but it's got (22:04 - 22:09)
teeth just like Breck's ish and it's got (22:06 - 22:12)
weird coloring um I've swum with them (22:09 - 22:15)
before I feel like the the brush brush (22:12 - 22:18)
six we we see in the picture is is (22:15 - 22:21)
female I wonder if we're going to get (22:18 - 22:23)
like a male version oh no I think that (22:21 - 22:24)
that's (22:23 - 22:25)
just do you think that's it's gonna be (22:24 - 22:29)
yeah very brightly colored lively I cuz (22:25 - 22:33)
i would like to see the colors match (22:29 - 22:36)
this picture of what you set me what may (22:33 - 22:38)
be the shiny will have those colors yeah (22:36 - 22:40)
it's is really cool for our listeners I (22:38 - 22:42)
can't see it's more of a white black (22:40 - 22:44)
like a dark orange and then a neon (22:42 - 22:47)
yellow I think it's really cool and a (22:44 - 22:48)
little bit of blue a little bit of neon (22:47 - 22:51)
blue in there too yeah yeah brush brush (22:48 - 22:54)
Ock's that's up the basket Lynn of gin 7 (22:51 - 22:56)
no no no because it's got the dazzling (22:54 - 22:59)
ability it's like this is game changer (22:56 - 23:02)
man all right all right ah cutie fly is (22:59 - 23:06)
next which is also a great name good (23:02 - 23:08)
name I think cutie fly is a bug fairy (23:06 - 23:10)
think the first bug fairy I keep saying (23:08 - 23:12)
this but I'm always wrong cutie pie oh I (23:10 - 23:14)
think yet bug fair this cat first bug (23:12 - 23:17)
fairy cutie fly can detect the auras of (23:14 - 23:19)
living things including people pokemon (23:17 - 23:22)
and plants these seek out flowers by (23:19 - 23:24)
cutting the color and the brightness of (23:22 - 23:27)
their auras and then they gather the (23:24 - 23:30)
nectar and pollen I feel like some (23:27 - 23:32)
somewhere I saw that this was a (23:30 - 23:35)
three-stage evolution but I could be (23:32 - 23:38)
wrong oh I don't know I didn't see that (23:35 - 23:40)
I did see that it's based on a real (23:38 - 23:44)
creature another Hawaiian animal I know (23:40 - 23:48)
I not specifically Hawaiian but it's a (23:44 - 23:52)
kind of a fly that is invades bees nests (23:48 - 23:56)
and leaves its larvae and bees nests to (23:52 - 23:59)
kill the bees ah well they steal (23:56 - 24:03)
resources from the bee larva so the (23:59 - 24:05)
thick kind of like you know how a cuckoo (24:03 - 24:08)
will lay its egg in other birds nests (24:05 - 24:12)
mm-hmm it's your long listen no that's (24:08 - 24:14)
right that before cuckoo birds lay their (24:12 - 24:16)
eggs and other birds nests so that those (24:14 - 24:18)
other birds can raise their young for (24:16 - 24:20)
them but so yeah but it actually looks (24:18 - 24:23)
kind of like a fuzzy be looking thing (24:20 - 24:26)
but it's actually a fly if you look it's (24:23 - 24:27)
real cute I mean the real ones real cute (24:26 - 24:30)
even if it's nefarious and its (24:27 - 24:33)
reproductive practices all right the (24:30 - 24:35)
bulbapedia article says they can learn a (24:33 - 24:37)
move called fairy wind well (24:35 - 24:39)
I mean most fairy types can learn fairy (24:37 - 24:42)
wind so that's not that exciting all (24:39 - 24:44)
right I thought we got going all right (24:42 - 24:48)
what we got next here we have last one (24:44 - 24:53)
in butcher the name togi day marty Maru (24:48 - 24:56)
I mean that's close its kind of based on (24:53 - 25:00)
the same as Togepi Soto get damaru toget (24:56 - 25:03)
okay toga damaru is a rollie pollie (25:00 - 25:05)
pokemon that is literally what it says (25:03 - 25:08)
is the roly-poly pokemon that gathers (25:05 - 25:11)
electricity and stores it the long (25:08 - 25:14)
needle that grows from its back of its (25:11 - 25:17)
head works as a lightning rod to attract (25:14 - 25:21)
electricity here is your Pikachu of gin (25:17 - 25:24)
7 yeah so I love hedgehogs and it's a (25:21 - 25:27)
real hedgehog it's real cute yeah yeah (25:24 - 25:31)
so we have Pikachu we have Plusle and (25:27 - 25:35)
minun and uh Jen 20 a was that Miss from (25:31 - 25:38)
gentoo we I'll go back to that we have (25:35 - 25:44)
Pachirisu Emolga did any did any it was (25:38 - 25:49)
gin too he chew Pete nuh Pichu yeah yeah (25:44 - 25:53)
Peter does like count no it does because (25:49 - 25:55)
I was having this discussion with one of (25:53 - 25:56)
our listeners and and maybe this is (25:55 - 25:59)
something that other folks can write in (25:56 - 26:04)
about where the electric rodent type is (25:59 - 26:07)
kind of a signifier of a new aspect (26:04 - 26:10)
that's introduced in that generation so (26:07 - 26:11)
he was like yeah I saw an article about (26:10 - 26:14)
that yeah so then he was wondering what (26:11 - 26:20)
toad toga damaru indicates about jen 7 (26:14 - 26:23)
which I couldn't think anything hahaha (26:20 - 26:27)
or or even what you know Pachirisu or (26:23 - 26:30)
emolga depicted for their generation so (26:27 - 26:33)
i am not sure that that I I saw that I (26:30 - 26:35)
was like they're really stretching here (26:33 - 26:37)
because I think Pachirisu was supposed (26:35 - 26:40)
to mean like the nintendo Wi-Fi network (26:37 - 26:42)
because it matched the colors i guess (26:40 - 26:45)
white and blue and then the people were (26:42 - 26:48)
they were saying that Plusle and minun (26:45 - 26:50)
represented double battles (26:48 - 26:53)
hatchery see was the nintendo Wi-Fi (26:50 - 26:55)
network which was kind of a stretch they (26:53 - 26:58)
said a moga represented a refreshed or (26:55 - 27:01)
red and blue based on its colors or (26:58 - 27:04)
something and i was like now that kind (27:01 - 27:07)
of a strike in white now yeah yeah and (27:04 - 27:12)
then what was after Emolga dedenne (27:07 - 27:15)
dedenne represented ferry because gen-6 (27:12 - 27:16)
introduced ferry and i was like oh okay (27:15 - 27:20)
yeah sure that that one lines up I don't (27:16 - 27:23)
I don't know it's it's it's funny how (27:20 - 27:25)
like many theories or how like people (27:23 - 27:28)
like are stretching I just think people (27:25 - 27:31)
are stretching a lot for attention like (27:28 - 27:34)
look at what this kind of represents and (27:31 - 27:35)
I you see that a lot and all of it (27:34 - 27:37)
that's like exclusive to pokemon but (27:35 - 27:40)
it's fun but it's also like yeah i think (27:37 - 27:43)
you you're overthinking this your cliq (27:40 - 27:45)
baiting friends yeah yeah i was just (27:43 - 27:48)
leading your own life it was it was it (27:45 - 27:50)
just goes back to like people thinking (27:48 - 27:53)
ditto and you or like ditto is a failed (27:50 - 27:56)
mule own or something like that because (27:53 - 27:58)
they have the same weight in the same (27:56 - 28:00)
color in the same shiny and then when (27:58 - 28:02)
they asked masuda about it he was like (28:00 - 28:05)
I've never heard that before it was like (28:02 - 28:07)
yeah I think you guys were stretching (28:05 - 28:10)
this a little thin it's fun for a minute (28:07 - 28:14)
but those are your seven new Pokemon and (28:10 - 28:17)
you're too old pokemon that now have (28:14 - 28:21)
english names so far so far i'm really (28:17 - 28:23)
happy with the everything they've shown (28:21 - 28:25)
yeah I am I was having a discussion with (28:23 - 28:28)
somebody else as well about why it (28:25 - 28:30)
appears there's so many electric types (28:28 - 28:33)
um with you know top you Coco also being (28:30 - 28:36)
electric and my what I'm going to guess (28:33 - 28:40)
at this point to add wild speculation to (28:36 - 28:41)
all those wild speculations that you (28:40 - 28:45)
just sat down is that each island might (28:41 - 28:48)
be a focal point for a particular type (28:45 - 28:51)
so Mellie Mellie island is a focal point (28:48 - 28:53)
for electric types and then maybe other (28:51 - 28:57)
islands will have sort of more common a (28:53 - 29:00)
particular type of you get what I'm (28:57 - 29:03)
saying pokemon on that island based on (29:00 - 29:04)
whatever the island guardian is (29:03 - 29:09)
yes yeah so did they say Five Islands I (29:04 - 29:11)
know it was a number of islands and then (29:09 - 29:13)
one artificial island because they keep (29:11 - 29:14)
trying to make that one feel bad because (29:13 - 29:18)
it's not a natural Island right okay the (29:14 - 29:21)
alala region is supposed to be made up (29:18 - 29:23)
of four main islands in one artificial (29:21 - 29:26)
island yep keep keep putting that out (29:23 - 29:29)
making that guy feel bad yep you know (29:26 - 29:31)
that island didn't ask to be an (29:29 - 29:34)
artificial island and you know what it's (29:31 - 29:36)
an island just the same as all the other (29:34 - 29:38)
islands no matter how it was created and (29:36 - 29:40)
where it came from and I think we should (29:38 - 29:42)
just treat it like an island like it (29:40 - 29:45)
deserves to be treated sale or (29:42 - 29:47)
artificial as of this recording there (29:45 - 29:50)
are 18 currently new Pokemon that brings (29:47 - 29:56)
our total to 302 739 Pokemon in the (29:50 - 29:59)
pokédex we have at least six new moves (29:56 - 30:03)
