additionally defeating one of these (2:08 - 2:12)
Pokemon into Max ray battles could get (2:10 - 2:14)
you useful items like destiny not and (2:12 - 2:17)
and or ever stone as of this recording (2:14 - 2:19)
it'll be around for another two or three (2:17 - 2:21)
days a couple things from this event (2:19 - 2:24)
kind of short but the dittos are all (2:21 - 2:27)
guaranteed 5 Ivy's rulebook gotta get (2:24 - 2:30)
some of them five-star ditto is normally (2:27 - 2:34)
guaranteed for Ivy's five-star raids (2:30 - 2:36)
were guaranteed for Forrester Reds are (2:34 - 2:37)
guaranteed three three-star roads (2:36 - 2:39)
guaranteed - so these are all guaranteed (2:37 - 2:39)
5 there (2:39 - 2:41)
promoted so they should appear in a (2:39 - 2:45)
variety of dens around the area there is (2:41 - 2:48)
still Charizard kappa raja garbodor etc (2:45 - 2:51)
that are appearing as well the did that (2:48 - 2:55)
all the baby Pokemon so not did OH are (2:51 - 2:58)
appearing exclusively in three or four (2:55 - 3:00)
star trades is there a strategy for (2:58 - 3:02)
making sure that you get the dude oh no (3:00 - 3:04)
just probably repeat bullet it's (3:02 - 3:06)
probably your buzzing ball how do you (3:04 - 3:07)
make sure that she is there any trick to (3:06 - 3:08)
making sure you kill it (3:07 - 3:13)
Oh ditto can't transform into a she ins (3:08 - 3:15)
a magenta or a turn attest so if you (3:13 - 3:17)
just bring those it literally cannot (3:15 - 3:20)
transform so it just struggles or just (3:17 - 3:22)
does max strike I think okay that's what (3:20 - 3:25)
strategy yeah I don't know if I could (3:22 - 3:28)
turn into melt in I'm assuming it can (3:25 - 3:30)
can definitely turn into Solrock I saw (3:28 - 3:34)
Martin bring that and yep turn into (3:30 - 3:37)
Solrock Martin but then that soil rock (3:34 - 3:40)
doesn't know when he moves so you have (3:37 - 3:42)
to worry about cosmic power them I (3:40 - 3:44)
wanted I can turn into me you I know (3:42 - 3:45)
that for sure (3:44 - 3:47)
cuz I've brought me from the pokeball (3:45 - 3:48)
plus it definitely can turn into Mew I (3:47 - 3:51)
think it's just yeah I think it's just (3:48 - 3:54)
zombies ntozake and eternities because (3:51 - 3:56)
those cannot those Pokemon cannot (3:54 - 3:59)
Dynomax so a ditto can turn into zombies (3:56 - 4:02)
enta but a Dynomax did oh cannot turn (3:59 - 4:04)
into zombies enta I see what you're (4:02 - 4:07)
saying it's it's a cool event they (4:04 - 4:10)
continue to do events I think we might (4:07 - 4:13)
have said that the kapa Rajah garbodor (4:10 - 4:16)
Charizard was too long because it does (4:13 - 4:18)
end at the end of April and it started (4:16 - 4:21)
the end of March but if this little (4:18 - 4:23)
event makes it feel less long I guess (4:21 - 4:24)
this is something to do I mean people (4:23 - 4:26)
are still playing Animal Crossing left (4:24 - 4:27)
and right so it's kind of hard to pull (4:26 - 4:30)
people away from Animal Crossing true (4:27 - 4:32)
especially Animal Crossing stacked two (4:30 - 4:34)
events on top of each other (4:32 - 4:36)
Oh (4:34 - 4:36)
well yes that's very frustrating and put (4:36 - 4:44)
me off the game but um I'm excited for (4:41 - 4:46)
this i I think Monday night raid nights (4:44 - 4:47)
gonna be a lot yeah well I'm excited (4:46 - 4:50)
Monday night raid night the I've done a (4:47 - 4:52)
couple of the babies they're really easy (4:50 - 4:54)
you could probably have fun and bring in (4:52 - 4:56)
a variety of Pokemon for the babies (4:54 - 5:00)
they're uh very straight up flexin yeah (4:56 - 5:01)
they're they're very easy to knock out (5:00 - 5:03)
but they're cute they're fun they also (5:01 - 5:07)
will drop power bands so if you're (5:03 - 5:09)
missing any of the power items Bo power (5:07 - 5:12)
anklets the power bracelets the power (5:09 - 5:15)
necklaces the power wristlets they're (5:12 - 5:18)
dropping all those and Everstone (5:15 - 5:20)
Destiny's not and they are also 10% (5:18 - 5:22)
chance I think to drop a lucky egg as (5:20 - 5:24)
well so even if you don't need any of (5:22 - 5:27)
these Destiny's not ever stone power (5:24 - 5:30)
items lucky egg drops are really good (5:27 - 5:32)
obviously you're getting rare candy as (5:30 - 5:36)
well too if you have all your Pokemon (5:32 - 5:39)
with multiple lucky eggs to they stack I (5:36 - 5:42)
don't know like there's the Sheridan (5:39 - 5:45)
stat yeah like the they get even more (5:42 - 5:48)
experience assume so and I think so I (5:45 - 5:51)
don't know where it splits his every (5:48 - 5:53)
game it's kind of done it I think they (5:51 - 5:55)
did it a certain way and like the Gentoo (5:53 - 5:57)
and then they change in Gen 3 and then I (5:55 - 5:58)
feel like they changed it ago they're (5:57 - 6:00)
always changing stuff up to keep me on (5:58 - 6:02)
my toes that's what my toes are tired I (6:00 - 6:05)
don't know yeah I'm not a hard percent (6:02 - 6:06)
sure on that I don't want to give false (6:05 - 6:12)
information I make an infographic nobody (6:06 - 6:16)
reads those the only people that know I (6:12 - 6:18)
was gonna say the only people that read (6:16 - 6:19)
them are the people arguing but their if (6:18 - 6:21)
they read it they would have a reason (6:19 - 6:26)
argue yeah you're wrong that's not how (6:21 - 6:28)
it works this is all soft Pokemon calm (6:26 - 6:30)
they showed off Rudes (6:28 - 6:34)
new exclusive move that it learns at (6:30 - 6:37)
level 90 once reaching level 90 (6:34 - 6:40)
Zurich an learn jungle healing a unique (6:37 - 6:42)
move that only the root can learn don't (6:40 - 6:43)
worry the root I'm sure they'll take it (6:42 - 6:44)
away from you in the future game oh (6:43 - 6:46)
absolutely (6:44 - 6:49)
in this grass type status move the (6:46 - 6:51)
Pokemon wraps its vines around trees to (6:49 - 6:53)
absorb their energy then releases that (6:51 - 6:56)
energy combined with its own healing (6:53 - 6:59)
power radiates around the area heals (6:56 - 7:01)
both the user and the aisle ally (6:59 - 7:05)
restoring HP and curing them of any (7:01 - 7:10)
status condition it does so help us or (7:05 - 7:11)
something that looks so angry (7:10 - 7:14)
it does say no note within Pokemon sword (7:11 - 7:16)
and shield only the root can learn (7:14 - 7:18)
jungle healing however it is possible (7:16 - 7:20)
that other Pokemon may be able to learn (7:18 - 7:24)
this move in future games (7:20 - 7:24)
get rekt so rude get rekt (7:24 - 7:31)
cuz kruky is gonna get it the next game (7:29 - 7:34)
they take away turbo blaze and teraflop (7:31 - 7:37)
from that ramen restaurant yeah but (7:34 - 7:39)
those were those were just they were (7:37 - 7:42)
always what was it the other one that (7:39 - 7:44)
makes things that shouldn't hit hit mold (7:42 - 7:46)
breaker well they were too small breaker (7:44 - 7:49)
yeah I'm talking about no they they have (7:46 - 7:51)
what what wait what is know as the (7:49 - 7:53)
fusion players what is there actually I (7:51 - 7:55)
did mention that was their bodies what (7:53 - 7:57)
is their actual move is it not using (7:55 - 8:00)
bolts fusion flare oh that's right (7:57 - 8:04)
they're their speciality I don't think (8:00 - 8:08)
anybody ever not but he needed Vic team (8:04 - 8:09)
to get it I thought Victini might have (8:08 - 8:12)
gotten fusion flare bolts I don't know (8:09 - 8:13)
what they're called yeah (8:12 - 8:15)
bolt strike is this the one that we're (8:13 - 8:17)
talking about bald strike that sounds (8:15 - 8:20)
right Victini did get bolt strike from (8:17 - 8:24)
Zekrom hmm the Pokemon Center (8:20 - 8:28)
Tohoku Victini had bolt strike and rushy (8:24 - 8:33)
Ram blue flare ah blue-eyes White Dragon (8:28 - 8:35)
and the Pokemon Center Tohoku Victini (8:33 - 8:39)
also had blue flare why wouldn't it why (8:35 - 8:40)
way yeah why not (8:39 - 8:43)
two is better than one else has gotten (8:40 - 8:46)
blue flare okay blue flare even do its (8:43 - 8:50)
mix things on fire the booth reflects (8:46 - 8:53)
damage and has a 20% chance of burning (8:50 - 8:56)
the target that's nothing (8:53 - 8:58)
a lot of things have a 20-person chance (8:56 - 9:00)
burdening the target hey no one said (8:58 - 9:05)
these were great yeah exactly I think my (9:00 - 9:07)
favorite thing I saw on the Internet (9:05 - 9:10)
I love reading the Internet guys a big (9:07 - 9:13)
fan of that dark place big fan of (9:10 - 9:15)
reading the Internet I saw a comment it (9:13 - 9:24)
said oh here we go the comments said we (9:15 - 9:29)
don't even need this pokemon and they're (9:24 - 9:33)
not wrong they're not wrong I mean we're (9:29 - 9:34)
good to start talking about what poke (9:33 - 9:36)
about we do or don't need we're not (9:34 - 9:39)
gonna play this game anymore yeah I mean (9:36 - 9:44)
I I needed to like take a step back and (9:39 - 9:46)
try to like see where they were coming (9:44 - 9:49)
from cuz you're right there's a lot of (9:46 - 9:51)
Pokemon we probably don't need I don't (9:49 - 9:55)
think anyone needs silcoon I don't think (9:51 - 9:58)
anyone needs Pidgey look there's whole (9:55 - 10:03)
lines of Pokemon right nobody needs (9:58 - 10:05)
madam but they were they were saying it (10:03 - 10:08)
based off the the hill the jungle (10:05 - 10:10)
healing that move right that's why you (10:08 - 10:13)
know it ended up on the the news or in (10:10 - 10:16)
and like I'm subreddits and Twitter and (10:13 - 10:18)
stuff the jungle healing so if they were (10:16 - 10:19)
talking about it from a competitive (10:18 - 10:21)
aspect there's a lot of Pokemon that (10:19 - 10:25)
don't even qualify in the the needing to (10:21 - 10:27)
be competitive I mean a lot of hope I (10:25 - 10:28)
should be competitive but they're not (10:27 - 10:32)
but also wreck if for some reason they (10:28 - 10:34)
thought they were like being like oh we (10:32 - 10:35)
don't need this Pokemon because they're (10:34 - 10:37)
not gonna help the competitive scene (10:35 - 10:39)
they wouldn't help the competitive scene (10:37 - 10:45)
anyways its mythical there's no 2021 the (10:39 - 10:47)
year of the mythical when this is (10:45 - 10:50)
dominating the competitive scene you're (10:47 - 10:52)
gonna mark today down and we'll see how (10:50 - 10:54)
this holds up any yes you're like the (10:52 - 10:58)
the 1% of Pokemon fans that place Mogan (10:54 - 11:01)
and I'm sorry like there's such a small (10:58 - 11:03)
percentage of people that play (11:01 - 11:04)
competitive Pokemon and there's an even (11:03 - 11:06)
smaller percent of people that want to (11:04 - 11:09)
set up their own arbitrary rules to you (11:06 - 11:10)
know remove all the (11:09 - 11:13)
rng like this it's just another Pokemon (11:10 - 11:15)
I mean they'll like I don't think (11:13 - 11:18)
anyone's been like we need a stone (11:15 - 11:20)
journey as really turning the tides here (11:18 - 11:25)
like what this just a Pokemon okay we (11:20 - 11:28)
don't need the rude well that's just (11:25 - 11:31)
like tears you see that in like every (11:28 - 11:34)
form of competition where people are (11:31 - 11:36)
like it's all about the competitive and (11:34 - 11:40)
it's like 98% of the world is like it's (11:36 - 11:42)
not about the competitive at all friends (11:40 - 11:44)
but that 2% right oh it's it's (11:42 - 11:45)
everything should be about the (11:44 - 11:49)
competitive yes and as as we've learned (11:45 - 11:52)
from reddit 1 Japan doesn't have the (11:49 - 11:54)
Internet we've we've no narrowed that (11:52 - 11:56)
down but number two is reddit is (11:54 - 11:58)
probably the last place you want to go (11:56 - 12:00)
for competitive information this was (11:58 - 12:02)
like do you keep making me go to reddit (12:00 - 12:04)
there now you know you couldn't stop (12:02 - 12:06)
with reddit is the last place you want (12:04 - 12:08)
to go exactly everybody would have been (12:06 - 12:10)
in agreement to be fair I saw that (12:08 - 12:13)
comment on our / Nintendo now it's time (12:10 - 12:17)
to unsubscribe from our / Nintendo but (12:13 - 12:19)
our / Pokemon was the same community (12:17 - 12:22)
that was like oh my goodness g max dread (12:19 - 12:27)
nog gets a G max rockfall and it sets up (12:22 - 12:29)
stealth rock well this is just broken (12:27 - 12:31)
the entire competitive scene is over now (12:29 - 12:33)
because of this one I don't think a (12:31 - 12:35)
single competitive person is even (12:33 - 12:40)
touched at Remax red now maybe if you (12:35 - 12:42)
were playing maybe if you actually (12:40 - 12:44)
played competitive reddit and said I'm (12:42 - 12:46)
wasting your time commenting on things (12:44 - 12:48)
you didn't know about you'd understand (12:46 - 12:54)
that no one uses tell the rock people on (12:48 - 12:57)
reddit to stop commenting a things that (12:54 - 12:59)
they know nothing about then reddit will (12:57 - 13:01)
cease to exist also I didn't know there (12:59 - 13:03)
was such a thing as competitive reddit (13:01 - 13:06)
and I hear another comment about how the (13:03 - 13:08)
store and Animal Crossing upgrades after (13:06 - 13:11)
30 days you're a chapter 13 I don't know (13:08 - 13:13)
where you read it from but multiple (13:11 - 13:15)
people have the store and they did not (13:13 - 13:18)
time travel I don't know what triggers (13:15 - 13:19)
the store stop coming into my twitch (13:18 - 13:21)
chat and telling me that the store only (13:19 - 13:23)
upgrades after 30 days because you're (13:21 - 13:24)
ready (13:23 - 13:26)
on reddit no it doesn't it upgrades (13:24 - 13:30)
somehow some way 30 days top Dirk is (13:26 - 13:32)
holding out on me game hasn't even been (13:30 - 13:36)
out for 30 days so how would you know 30 (13:32 - 13:41)
days 30 bugs 30 fish 30 fossils you have (13:36 - 13:46)
to spend Mike exactly 3030 in Nuuk shop (13:41 - 13:48)
no more no less so if you think you're (13:46 - 13:51)
over you have to sell everything to eat (13:48 - 13:54)
you back down to zero and then buy to 30 (13:51 - 13:57)
30 because 30 is clearly the key I could (13:54 - 13:59)
never do an animal crossing podcast (13:57 - 14:01)
because the amount of misinformation (13:59 - 14:04)
around animal crossing new horizon (14:01 - 14:14)
animal animal crossing line is available (14:04 - 14:16)
everywhere where you can find podcasts (14:14 - 14:19)
you don't talk about rumors or (14:16 - 14:22)
speculations on that show it's just a (14:19 - 14:25)
purely informative joyful show we're (14:22 - 14:29)
only positivity happens okay but the the (14:25 - 14:32)
amount of misinformation around Animal (14:29 - 14:35)
Crossing is actually mind-blowing well (14:32 - 14:37)
if they put out that guidebook we (14:35 - 14:39)
wouldn't have this issue now would we (14:37 - 14:42)
that's true anyway is there no prima (14:39 - 14:43)
guide for the game because that was my (14:42 - 14:46)
next thing there is delay a guidebook (14:43 - 14:48)
but they have to ship it through boats (14:46 - 14:51)
and the the boating community is a bit (14:48 - 14:54)
behind because of the virus okay I put (14:51 - 14:56)
the books on the boats well it's not (14:54 - 15:00)
ready I'm also pretty sure that prima is (14:56 - 15:04)
not the publisher I can't remember the (15:00 - 15:07)
publisher future press future press yes (15:04 - 15:08)
yeah they put out a blog post saying (15:07 - 15:10)
that Australia and us will get the book (15:08 - 15:13)
like a month late jungle healings a rude (15:10 - 15:17)
gets it when it hits level 90 uh that's (15:13 - 15:20)
that's it that's the news the route is (15:17 - 15:22)
still a Pokemon oh so this is even worse (15:20 - 15:25)
because the majority of people aren't (15:22 - 15:26)
going to level up there's a rude to (15:25 - 15:29)
level 90 they're gonna hide me get it (15:26 - 15:32)
from the distribution in a box and never (15:29 - 15:35)
touch it again I will because I have so (15:32 - 15:37)
many candies it takes two seconds (15:35 - 15:39)
max that out and be like fine get to 100 (15:37 - 15:42)
just be done with us next we are going (15:39 - 15:45)
to needs a rude for future max raid (15:42 - 15:47)
battles where we can jungle heal the (15:45 - 15:50)
entire party to defeat oh yeah when it (15:47 - 15:55)
comes back this is off dexter TOCOM (15:50 - 15:59)
Pokemon company threatens Pokemon sword (15:55 - 16:03)
and shield cheaters I'm gonna say that (15:59 - 16:04)
that headlines a little click Beatty (16:03 - 16:09)
oh is it I don't especially with the (16:04 - 16:12)
picture of a very very angry aliena (16:09 - 16:15)
trainers have been exploiting a bug in (16:12 - 16:17)
Pokemon sword and shield to prevent them (16:15 - 16:19)
from getting a legitimate loss in ranked (16:17 - 16:21)
battles now though the Pokemon company (16:19 - 16:23)
it seems to had enough they're (16:21 - 16:24)
threatening to ban players that do it (16:23 - 16:26)
I'm sure the word threat was never used (16:24 - 16:29)
this exploit is not a threat it's a (16:26 - 16:31)
promise the exploit occurs at the end of (16:29 - 16:33)
the battle when you lost without dulling (16:31 - 16:35)
too much into specifics in an effort not (16:33 - 16:38)
to amplify the problem you can turn off (16:35 - 16:39)
your Nintendo switch at certain points (16:38 - 16:42)
to prevent the loss this may prevent the (16:39 - 16:44)
loss for players in question but more (16:42 - 16:46)
worrying it actually stops the player (16:44 - 16:47)
from getting the wind (16:46 - 16:50)
this means the exploit will affect if (16:47 - 16:52)
effectively mean that the battle never (16:50 - 16:55)
happened the issue has become so (16:52 - 16:57)
prevalent that the Pokemon company did (16:55 - 16:59)
address it in a matter did address it (16:57 - 17:00)
directly (16:59 - 17:02)
this really isn't typical of other (17:00 - 17:05)
exploits addressed in the same manner (17:02 - 17:09)
there this is off the Pokemon - support (17:05 - 17:14)
comm / news / article which is Pokemon - (17:09 - 17:17)
support comm is the Japanese support (17:14 - 17:19)
page which is kind of weird because it's (17:17 - 17:20)
usually it's like Pokemon debt JP (17:19 - 17:25)
anyways it's how it is the translated (17:20 - 17:27)
I'm assuming the R I'm just gonna assume (17:25 - 17:29)
the author used Google Translate but (17:27 - 17:31)
maybe they have a Japanese person and (17:29 - 17:33)
site that can translate fluently but (17:31 - 17:35)
this is what it's been translated to it (17:33 - 17:37)
says it has been confirmed that players (17:35 - 17:41)
in trainer battles and online (17:37 - 17:42)
competitions have deliberately (17:41 - 17:43)
interrupted their internet (17:42 - 17:45)
communications resulting in improper (17:43 - 17:48)
manipulation of their matches they then (17:45 - 17:51)
said if it is confirmed that such (17:48 - 17:53)
illegal operation and annoying acts have (17:51 - 17:55)
been performed repeatedly the cheater (17:53 - 17:58)
will be excluded from participating in (17:55 - 18:00)
ranked battles and internet competitions (17:58 - 18:02)
and the right to participate in live (18:00 - 18:04)
competitions this has not been addressed (18:02 - 18:09)
in the at the in the US at all hmm but (18:04 - 18:13)
that was published on April 8th so just (18:09 - 18:14)
four days ago as of this recording (18:13 - 18:17)
cheaters never win the easy thing would (18:14 - 18:19)
be like why don't they patch it I'm sure (18:17 - 18:23)
they're working on a patch hi it may not (18:19 - 18:25)
be patchable it's just don't just be (18:23 - 18:26)
like because you're manipulating the way (18:25 - 18:32)
that the but the game data is saved it's (18:26 - 18:34)
like no matter where they put the timing (18:32 - 18:38)
of how that save occurs that's like the (18:34 - 18:39)
probably the only thing that they can do (18:38 - 18:40)
is patch it in a way that they'll be (18:39 - 18:42)
able to more easily detect who's doing (18:40 - 18:45)
this and maybe like Auto banned them but (18:42 - 18:48)
not in a way that can stop it from (18:45 - 18:50)
happening and I think they have to be (18:48 - 18:53)
pretty careful in I mean they clearly (18:50 - 18:56)
will see it on the back end I'm assuming (18:53 - 18:58)
of like this was not a completed match (18:56 - 19:00)
this was not a completed match because (18:58 - 19:03)
if you if you okay so I've done a lot of (19:00 - 19:07)
ranked battles if you rage quit and I've (19:03 - 19:09)
had people rage quit against me the (19:07 - 19:11)
battle will like immediately end it will (19:09 - 19:13)
say like Oh battle is over it'll say (19:11 - 19:15)
like communication error or whatever (19:13 - 19:16)
actually I think it's this communication (19:15 - 19:19)
error first but you but I have always (19:16 - 19:21)
gotten the win I still get the win from (19:19 - 19:23)
the rage quit so that's not what they're (19:21 - 19:24)
saying (19:23 - 19:27)
you can still if if if you still want to (19:24 - 19:28)
you know turn off your console or throw (19:27 - 19:30)
it across the room in a rage of fury (19:28 - 19:32)
that you lost so my stealth rock debt (19:30 - 19:35)
dread nah I should still be able to get (19:32 - 19:36)
the win I am sure though that there's (19:35 - 19:39)
been situations where you know internet (19:36 - 19:40)
just cuts out or something happened (19:39 - 19:43)
where the match just doesn't count I (19:40 - 19:46)
don't think for the majority of people (19:43 - 19:49)
that this is ever going to affect them I (19:46 - 19:51)
don't think anyone has to worry about (19:49 - 19:52)
like oh I don't know if I want to do (19:51 - 19:54)
right because my Internet's being wonky (19:52 - 19:55)
and if it cuts out I don't want to get (19:54 - 19:58)
banned I am sure they're specifically (19:55 - 20:01)
going after people that are doing this (19:58 - 20:04)
multiple times in an evening or like (20:01 - 20:04)
they own (20:04 - 20:09)
have wins and disconnects I feel like (20:04 - 20:11)
that is like the easiest way to tell (20:09 - 20:13)
like oh you've never lost you only have (20:11 - 20:16)
wins and you only have no gate no (20:13 - 20:19)
contest no contest no game come like but (20:16 - 20:20)
you're right hey I didn't think about (20:19 - 20:22)
that maybe there's no way to patch it (20:20 - 20:24)
but this is a relatively new issue I (20:22 - 20:26)
mean we do a podcast every week we (20:24 - 20:28)
didn't talk about this last week if they (20:26 - 20:30)
were to do a patch it'd be relatively (20:28 - 20:32)
quickly for them to like find it address (20:30 - 20:37)
it push an update midseason so I at the (20:32 - 20:38)
end of the day I don't think this is a (20:37 - 20:41)
huge deal I think the author of dextro (20:38 - 20:44)
is really going hard on the the (20:41 - 20:47)
clickbait of the article but yeah and (20:44 - 20:50)
there's probably I mean it's probably (20:47 - 20:52)
more apparent because more people are (20:50 - 20:54)
doing online play versus going to a (20:52 - 20:56)
Pokemon League and playing in person (20:54 - 20:59)
yeah so that's why this becomes more (20:56 - 21:01)
noticeable I'm not sure so many people (20:59 - 21:04)
at home figuring it out and then once (21:01 - 21:06)
they figured it out spread it out I (21:04 - 21:08)
think it probably just hit critical mass (21:06 - 21:12)
with so many people not being able to do (21:08 - 21:15)
anything but play games at home I wonder (21:12 - 21:17)
how much the competitive is taking a hit (21:15 - 21:19)
though of people just not interested in (21:17 - 21:22)
competing until the 2020 season is over (21:19 - 21:25)
okay any points even if you were (21:22 - 21:28)
practicing with Pokemon now you know (21:25 - 21:30)
comes September when the new season (21:28 - 21:32)
starts there will already be one (21:30 - 21:35)
expansion out with new Pokemon so it's (21:32 - 21:38)
like why even bother yeah but somebody (21:35 - 21:40)
for the joy of competing that's true (21:38 - 21:42)
that's you don't want the practice some (21:40 - 21:45)
people want to learn all of the current (21:42 - 21:47)
strats because if somebody tries to fake (21:45 - 21:49)
everybody out by going back to something (21:47 - 21:52)
else like there's a lot of knowledge and (21:49 - 21:54)
practice still to be gained even if you (21:52 - 21:58)
aren't in the current you know season (21:54 - 22:00)
like yeah so much of what that game is (21:58 - 22:02)
as being able to predict correctly and (22:00 - 22:04)
know what the most common moves are and (22:02 - 22:07)
that just is repetition over and over (22:04 - 22:09)
and over and over again when you're (22:07 - 22:10)
watching one of these competitive people (22:09 - 22:13)
on Twitch they they seem to always win (22:10 - 22:14)
because they're like playing at eight (22:13 - 22:17)
hours a day every single day (22:14 - 22:19)
and I'm playing competitive maybe like (22:17 - 22:23)
two hours a week and I'm playing once (22:19 - 22:25)
every time there's a ball guys shirt and (22:23 - 22:30)
is a luxury ball guy I can't wait for (22:25 - 22:30)
that day to come (22:30 - 22:33)
all right let's let's take a break here (22:30 - 22:37)
and when we come back we have a little (22:33 - 22:39)
bit more pokemon news some TCG news some (22:37 - 22:42)

services but it's not free I guess I (24:39 - 24:47)
know neither of you to cancel that your (24:43 - 24:49)
HBO subscription when you were done with (24:47 - 24:56)
Game of Thrones is this what I have to (24:49 - 24:58)
put my legal requirement that I work for (24:56 - 25:00)
a company that owns HBO so I get it at a (24:58 - 25:02)
high discount so no I didn't cancel it (25:00 - 25:05)
oh where I put my legal requirement that (25:02 - 25:08)
I never had a subscription to HBO and I (25:05 - 25:10)
don't care about Game of Thrones (25:08 - 25:14)
well if you happen to keep your HBO (25:10 - 25:18)
after Game of Thrones they just added (25:14 - 25:22)
Pokemon detective Pikachu to the service (25:18 - 25:25)

my work internally doing the good fight (25:25 - 25:31)
it's not that's that's pretty much it (25:29 - 25:33)
that's pretty much the story if you have (25:31 - 25:39)
HBO and HBO did if you have a lot of our (25:33 - 25:42)
streaming services check into your HBO (25:39 - 25:44)
availability they did either heavily (25:42 - 25:46)
discounted or include it for free for a (25:44 - 25:47)
lot of people so you may have it and not (25:46 - 25:48)

look they got it they got a cell booster (26:40 - 26:46)
pack so why are these rebels clashing (26:42 - 26:47)
what are they clashing against I think (26:46 - 26:49)

the max bullet attack hits your (29:03 - 29:08)
opponent's active pokémon for 161 of (29:06 - 29:11)
their bench Pokemon first 60 Hydra (29:08 - 29:13)
sniped also does 60 damage but lets you (29:11 - 29:14)
send an energy attached to your (29:13 - 29:15)
opponent's active pokémon back to their (29:14 - 29:18)
hand and it seems fine (29:15 - 29:21)
yeah sure although the full art (29:18 - 29:23)
Antillean it's really good-looking (29:21 - 29:25)
well arts always look good I know but (29:23 - 29:26)
this is really good (29:25 - 29:28)
so this that's coming out I this is the (29:26 - 29:32)
first time boy since this is the first (29:28 - 29:35)
time since black and white the last box (29:32 - 29:39)
I think I bought was plasma freeze I did (29:35 - 29:42)
not buy a single box of anything X&Y or (29:39 - 29:44)
Sun and Moon although I did buy I (29:42 - 29:46)
started buying elite trainer boxes when (29:44 - 29:48)
Sun and Moon came out so I completely (29:46 - 29:50)
mixed missed everything X&Y (29:48 - 29:53)
probably for the best full-backs of (29:50 - 29:56)
cosmic eclipse your favorite no I bought (29:53 - 29:58)
two elite trainer boxes of cosmic (29:56 - 30:01)
eclipse which is kind of dumb cuz you're (29:58 - 30:03)
paying extra for like sleeves and dice (30:01 - 30:06)
and the box itself you're paying a (30:03 - 30:09)
little bit extra for that I probably (30:06 - 30:11)
should you most people only need one buy (30:09 - 30:16)
Holy Trinity but I have pre-ordered a (30:11 - 30:19)
booster box of rebel clash and I did get (30:16 - 30:21)
a pre I did get a booster box of sword (30:19 - 30:22)
and shield because they've been really (30:21 - 30:26)
fun to open up on stream I'm excited I'm (30:22 - 30:30)
excited to receive a fresh brand-new set (30:26 - 30:33)
of Pokemon TCG the cards of the cards in (30:30 - 30:35)
this these last couple sets I've at (30:33 - 30:36)

the best hair and I'm really hoping we (31:02 - 31:07)
get access to the Royal hair line in the (31:04 - 31:10)
first expansion pass because if we do (31:07 - 31:12)
not get access to the Royal hair line (31:10 - 31:16)

I swear if anybody's ever on any kind of (37:16 - 37:22)
TCG Facebook group at least once a week (37:19 - 37:24)
there's a discussion of who is the (37:22 - 37:26)
scoundrel who's shipping cards without (37:24 - 37:29)
using a top loader I mean they should be (37:26 - 37:31)
put in prison you have you don't (37:29 - 37:34)
be--that's can hundred whole you know (37:31 - 37:37)
cheap and top loaders are like five (37:34 - 37:39)
cents each they're so they're so you can (37:37 - 37:42)
get a hundred top loaders for like $6.99 (37:39 - 37:46)
on Amazon they're dirt cheap I don't (37:42 - 37:47)
understand who's shipping cards in that (37:46 - 37:49)
without top loaders especially if you're (37:47 - 37:52)
shipping one card it's like sleeve it (37:49 - 37:54)
top loaded put a stamp on it throw in an (37:52 - 37:56)
envelope you're fine it'll make you (37:54 - 37:58)
don't even have to go to Facebook this (37:56 - 38:01)
week I just saved you don't have to find (37:58 - 38:03)
that thread of the scoundrel who did you (38:01 - 38:07)
that oppler for you right here like I'm (38:03 - 38:09)
bringing up reddit complaints and wills (38:07 - 38:15)
over here bringing face I refuse to get (38:09 - 38:17)
sucked into reddit (38:15 - 38:19)
no matter how many times you try to (38:17 - 38:30)
trick me read it (38:19 - 38:30)
Florida backyard look at these tragic (38:30 - 38:36)
toilet placements reddit look at this (38:33 - 38:38)
shower with an orange in it ready look (38:36 - 38:40)
red it's awful but I'm think I think if (38:38 - 38:42)
I have to pick a side I'm picking reddit (38:40 - 38:44)
over Facebook not on the card fight (38:42 - 38:47)
Vanguard community oh that's why you got (38:44 - 38:50)
to start your own reddit community for (38:47 - 38:53)
Vanguard and then you can nurture and (38:50 - 38:56)
grow it stop trying to get me to use (38:53 - 38:58)
reddit you're not gonna make reddit a (38:56 - 39:03)
thing this is off Pokemon go live.com (38:58 - 39:06)
for one pokey coin in the shop you can (39:03 - 39:10)
get 20 ultra balls and 15 pin apps you (39:06 - 39:13)
can access that until Monday April 13th (39:10 - 39:16)
3 p.m. central time so if you have not (39:13 - 39:18)
redeemed that please do they will rotate (39:16 - 39:19)
it out with something else semantics (39:18 - 39:23)
because of the world that situation has (39:19 - 39:24)
been (39:23 - 39:27)
taking out different boxes on Mondays (39:24 - 39:30)
for one coin so last week it was 50 (39:27 - 39:33)
great balls the week before it was 100 (39:30 - 39:36)
all pokeballs I do feel a little ripped (39:33 - 39:38)
off that it wasn't 25 ultra balls but I (39:36 - 39:41)
guess they countered it out with 15 pin (39:38 - 39:43)
at Barry's so if you are still playing (39:41 - 39:47)
Pokemon go make sure you redeem that I'm (39:43 - 39:49)
playing right now was there supposed to (39:47 - 39:50)
be an event today there was an event (39:49 - 39:54)
today there was a mayoral battle League (39:50 - 39:59)
day who what I know what Meryl is so (39:54 - 40:04)
during 11:00 to 2:00 your time you could (39:59 - 40:09)
do go battle league and you could so (40:04 - 40:10)
they change you know how it was like you (40:09 - 40:12)
have to do three matches and then if you (40:10 - 40:13)
win the fourth match you get a Pokemon (40:12 - 40:17)
and then after five matches the caches (40:13 - 40:19)
and resets and you can do that unlimited (40:17 - 40:21)
or you could do the paid version where (40:19 - 40:23)
you get a Pokemon at two wins and step (40:21 - 40:23)
four wins (40:23 - 40:26)
well they updated it for the three hours (40:23 - 40:29)
where you get one win you get a Pokemon (40:26 - 40:30)
and that Pokemon was guaranteed to be (40:29 - 40:32)
Merrill and there was a like i'll i (40:30 - 40:34)
think the self rode as of this recording (40:32 - 40:36)
said it was about a one-inch chance of a (40:34 - 40:38)
shiny merrill and then you would get (40:36 - 40:39)
another pokemon that three wins and then (40:38 - 40:41)
I think another f4 and then it would (40:39 - 40:45)
reset so that happened I did I got two (40:41 - 40:47)
Merrill's neither were shiny it's fine (40:45 - 40:50)
you could pay the dollar to get like all (40:47 - 40:52)
Merrill's I think all five were (40:50 - 40:56)
Merrill's for your wins i I don't know (40:52 - 41:00)
if they saw it as a success I think that (40:56 - 41:03)
Pokemon go battling is still kind of bad (41:00 - 41:06)
I think great league is is the the great (41:03 - 41:08)
league is fun enough for me to be (41:06 - 41:10)
interested in doing it like once a day (41:08 - 41:12)
because I think the entry to I think the (41:10 - 41:14)
Pokemon choice is in great league are (41:12 - 41:15)
more interesting and I think it's easier (41:14 - 41:19)
to be more willing to try things at such (41:15 - 41:22)
a low Stardust and candy cost but this (41:19 - 41:25)
was Master rank stuff so the only things (41:22 - 41:26)
you were probably fighting against were (41:25 - 41:31)
like Guerra Tina and Dialga and anyone (41:26 - 41:33)
who is serious is probably having one of (41:31 - 41:34)
those to be their walking buddy so they (41:33 - 41:36)
can max out the CP and have the little (41:34 - 41:37)
ribbon on it (41:36 - 41:41)
I just don't cash I just don't know why (41:37 - 41:44)
cuz they just wrote it rotated to master (41:41 - 41:46)
ranked like a couple days ago (41:44 - 41:48)
like why master rank I don't know what (41:46 - 41:50)
they were trying to do or prove but like (41:48 - 41:52)
number one if you're not they already (41:50 - 41:54)
know the majority of the playerbase is (41:52 - 41:57)
not level forty I know like I know look (41:54 - 41:59)
there's hardcore people that have been (41:57 - 42:00)
level forty since like the second week (41:59 - 42:01)
of the game (42:00 - 42:03)
the majority of Pokemon players are not (42:01 - 42:05)
the majority of Pokemon go players are (42:03 - 42:07)
not level forty if you're not level (42:05 - 42:10)
forty you can't max out your Pokemon you (42:07 - 42:12)
have to be at least level 38 to max out (42:10 - 42:15)
your Pokemon maxing out a Pokemon such (42:12 - 42:18)
as Giratina or Dialga would one require (42:15 - 42:21)
you to do a lot of raids to even have a (42:18 - 42:22)
good garrett ena (42:21 - 42:26)
or a good dialga and then two would just (42:22 - 42:29)
destroy you in stardust number three if (42:26 - 42:32)
you did do a lot of raids and you spent (42:29 - 42:34)
a lot of money you probably still don't (42:32 - 42:35)
have enough candy to do it so then (42:34 - 42:37)
you're using rare candy to Max them out (42:35 - 42:39)
then on top of that they want you to (42:37 - 42:41)
like walk with one of them to like boost (42:39 - 42:43)
their CP even more their likes just so (42:41 - 42:47)
many barriers so like I hate Master rank (42:43 - 42:49)
for all those reasons but why would you (42:47 - 42:52)
apply every single one of those barriers (42:49 - 42:54)
to something that like hey everyone we (42:52 - 42:57)
have this cool event that not all of you (42:54 - 42:59)
can do and even if you did want to (42:57 - 43:02)
compete with your your CP 3000 Kyogre (42:59 - 43:03)
well guess what it's not good enough (43:02 - 43:06)
because all these players have 4000 CP K (43:03 - 43:08)
yogurts because they spent way more (43:06 - 43:11)
money than you it's like very clear it's (43:08 - 43:14)
not like I got lucky I got a really good (43:11 - 43:17)
you know Tropius traded from me from my (43:14 - 43:20)
friend Hannah and I can use it in master (43:17 - 43:22)
like and I got really lucky and it (43:20 - 43:23)
competes with all these other Pokemon (43:22 - 43:26)
it's did you spend enough money and play (43:23 - 43:28)
our game enough to be level 42 verse (43:26 - 43:31)
other level 40 players in an event on a (43:28 - 43:32)
weekend that is supposed to be quote (43:31 - 43:35)
unquote for everyone it like why was (43:32 - 43:37)
this not great league or why when I (43:35 - 43:39)
could not go into it I don't get to like (43:37 - 43:41)
do I want to play great league do I (43:39 - 43:43)
wanna play ultra League do want why is (43:41 - 43:47)
it specifically is such a bad premise uh (43:43 - 43:50)
it's called masterly for a reason (43:47 - 43:54)
supposed to be a master yeah its elite (43:50 - 43:56)
for elite people like how can you put (43:54 - 43:57)
out a press release that says celebrate (43:56 - 44:00)
the launch of go battle league (43:57 - 44:02)
leaderboards with Meryl day like (44:00 - 44:04)
brand-new event featuring the Merrill (44:02 - 44:07)
have fun a pot they say in their press (44:04 - 44:09)
release a popular Pokemon for a great (44:07 - 44:12)
link why are we doing this advance early (44:09 - 44:18)
gun antic why it's all bad it's awful oh (44:12 - 44:21)
gosh you'll be able to compete 20 sets (44:18 - 44:23)
of go league battles from the regular (44:21 - 44:25)
sets of five you can do a hundred (44:23 - 44:28)
battles a hundred awful battles against (44:25 - 44:32)
Naga no one wants to do this and people (44:28 - 44:37)
complain about me yeah like what was the (44:32 - 44:42)
thought process like event should be fun (44:37 - 44:45)
okay it is Pokemon go we're talking (44:42 - 44:47)
about fun is how you make it and you (44:45 - 44:49)
could say like just skip the event this (44:47 - 44:51)
is what we've always say just skip the (44:49 - 44:54)
event but I like genuinely genuinely (44:51 - 44:58)
want to give go badly good chance and (44:54 - 45:02)
even if I was like okay I you know what (44:58 - 45:04)
I've hated Master League before you're (45:02 - 45:06)
gonna hate it now I I'm gonna really (45:04 - 45:10)
give it need the old the old try right (45:06 - 45:12)
you know just suck it up you know invest (45:10 - 45:15)
my Stardust invest my rare candy do it (45:12 - 45:18)
even if I wanted to and I did this with (45:15 - 45:22)
VGC like right I said on this podcast (45:18 - 45:23)
for years that like you know what I'm (45:22 - 45:26)
not really into competitive and when (45:23 - 45:27)
sword and shield came out I was like you (45:26 - 45:28)
know what I'm gonna suck it up I'm gonna (45:27 - 45:31)
rent some teams I'm gonna keep losing (45:28 - 45:33)
and people saw me lose and get (45:31 - 45:35)
frustrated on stream because I (45:33 - 45:37)
inherently I am a competitive person but (45:35 - 45:40)
over time I got better at it and I saw (45:37 - 45:44)
improvements and now I feel like I have (45:40 - 45:47)
a pretty good grasp at like amateur (45:44 - 45:50)
level competition but even if I wanted (45:47 - 45:53)
to compete to do like 5050 right win one (45:50 - 45:55)
match lose one match whatever you know (45:53 - 45:57)
or even you know win one match lose (45:55 - 45:59)
three matches whatever (45:57 - 46:02)
the amount of barriers you have to jump (45:59 - 46:05)
through are impossible I can't just go (46:02 - 46:07)
out and get a garrote inna I just can't (46:05 - 46:10)
go out and get a Dialga so like I can't (46:07 - 46:12)
I can't imagine a player who's like (46:10 - 46:14)
sitting at home being like you know what (46:12 - 46:17)
I really want to compete the alga and (46:14 - 46:20)
Giratina are good I have 300 rare candy (46:17 - 46:22)
that I've been saving I'm gonna sit here (46:20 - 46:25)
and I have this really bad Dialga that I (46:22 - 46:28)
guess like it's my only one I guess I'm (46:25 - 46:30)
just going to invest all the Stardust (46:28 - 46:34)
and all this rawr candy and oh I'm still (46:30 - 46:36)
losing because I didn't get a good (46:34 - 46:39)
enough four stars and when dialga comes (46:36 - 46:41)
back around oh cool I caught a four star (46:39 - 46:44)
but I just wasted all the 300 rare candy (46:41 - 46:47)
and I'm out of Stardust like what that's (46:44 - 46:50)
such a bad experience in any kind of (46:47 - 46:52)
game this is not specific to Pokemon go (46:50 - 46:54)
but just that like thought process of (46:52 - 46:56)
like and again I wouldn't probably have (46:54 - 46:58)
this complaint if this was great League (46:56 - 47:00)
because greatly the barrier to great (46:58 - 47:03)
league is so low and they literally in (47:00 - 47:05)
this press release say that this Pokemon (47:03 - 47:08)
is amazing in great league well awesome (47:05 - 47:11)
well like some like what what do you (47:08 - 47:12)
want your player but if you want your (47:11 - 47:14)
player base to be happy why did you do (47:12 - 47:16)
this event the only people being happy (47:14 - 47:18)
are the people are that are like yup (47:16 - 47:21)
been walking this Diago for 18 weeks (47:18 - 47:23)
oh yeah it's 4,000 I don't know why they (47:21 - 47:31)
sound so like probably still driving to (47:23 - 47:34)
raids every single day during a pandemic (47:31 - 47:34)
the car we're gonna drive around 15 (47:35 - 47:40)
miles an hour and not get arrested so I (47:38 - 47:42)
can get my candies so I can win the (47:40 - 47:44)
Master League I have met tons of people (47:42 - 47:46)
that love great league I've met a bunch (47:44 - 47:48)
of people that have a pretty good time (47:46 - 47:50)
in ultra League I find I have found no (47:48 - 47:54)
one and I talked to I talked to two (47:50 - 47:58)
hundred-plus Pokemon fans a day I talked (47:54 - 47:59)
to no one that has been happy with (47:58 - 48:02)
Master League I don't even know at what (47:59 - 48:05)
point is it is it is it it's everything (48:02 - 48:07)
it's everything about Master League it's (48:05 - 48:09)
the Pokemon it's the Stardust cost it's (48:07 - 48:12)
the rare candy cost like everything (48:09 - 48:14)
about Master League is (48:12 - 48:17)
bad and this is like this was like the (48:14 - 48:19)
Sunday event they decided to throw its (48:17 - 48:23)
the problem that all sort of high-level (48:19 - 48:26)
limited option games have right like (48:23 - 48:30)
there's no good way around when you have (48:26 - 48:33)
when it's must be you know these are the (48:30 - 48:37)
best and you design widely varying (48:33 - 48:40)
Pokemon and some are just never going to (48:37 - 48:42)
be adequate when you get a small pool (48:40 - 48:45)
and those pools are all legendary (48:42 - 48:48)
Pokemon it's just even in VZ C's is a (48:45 - 48:51)
frustrating experience but the cost is (48:48 - 48:53)
less this is like that's not true cuz (48:51 - 48:56)
the cost to be good at VGC is time (48:53 - 49:00)
well yeah any competitive is time I had (48:56 - 49:03)
some what I did I did so I play pokemon (49:00 - 49:05)
go on stream every tuesday cuz normally (49:03 - 49:07)
tuesday they do the six o'clock events (49:05 - 49:09)
and so I popped the incense I sit it's (49:07 - 49:11)
great to chat with other people they're (49:09 - 49:13)
doing the same thing we're all sitting (49:11 - 49:15)
at home with an incense on catching (49:13 - 49:17)
pitchy Xandra tattoes because the (49:15 - 49:19)
incense isn't popping anything good (49:17 - 49:21)
we're all having it like a good time (49:19 - 49:23)
just sitting talking catching pokémon (49:21 - 49:27)
and like last Tuesday I wrapped up you (49:23 - 49:29)
know the event was over it was the poor (49:27 - 49:31)
loins and stuff and I was like you know (49:29 - 49:34)
what um somebody was like what team are (49:31 - 49:36)
using for great league because I'm I'm (49:34 - 49:37)
almost positive as greatly no it was all (49:36 - 49:39)
true league at the time cuz I was like (49:37 - 49:41)
oh I have a toga kiss for Ultra League (49:39 - 49:44)
okay well um what chat why don't you (49:41 - 49:46)
help me like let's let's get this (49:44 - 49:48)
pokemon off the team you know I have hey (49:46 - 49:50)
I have hair crossed I got pincer-like (49:48 - 49:54)
I got whatever you want if you and I got (49:50 - 49:55)
all this for a candy you guys pick a (49:54 - 49:56)
Pokemon you think is good all invested (49:55 - 49:58)
were candy I'll invest the Stardust this (49:56 - 50:01)
will be fun and I was you know saying (49:58 - 50:02)
these complaints that I've said in the (50:01 - 50:04)
podcast about Master League and somebody (50:02 - 50:06)
was like well it's the same thing in the (50:04 - 50:09)
book about a video game in sin Aurora is (50:06 - 50:12)
just everywhere and it's like yes in (50:09 - 50:17)
ultra ly Giratina and Reggie Steele and (50:12 - 50:18)
all these other Pokemon are everywhere (50:17 - 50:22)
the difference is I can get and I can (50:18 - 50:25)
get a little with intimidate pretty (50:22 - 50:27)
easily in the video game (50:25 - 50:29)
I can't get a Reggie Steele right now I (50:27 - 50:32)
can't get a Giratina right now like that (50:29 - 50:35)
is the actual problem is like if these (50:32 - 50:39)
are the dominant Pokemon I I can't get (50:35 - 50:40)
them and even if I could get them I (50:39 - 50:42)
don't know if they're air quotes here I (50:40 - 50:44)
don't know if they're you know go battle (50:42 - 50:48)
league ready yeah because you don't (50:44 - 50:50)
check them immediately after you catch (50:48 - 50:55)
them so annoying going back to all of (50:50 - 50:57)
that if this is the if you're announcing (50:55 - 50:59)
a new feature of a leaderboard you're (50:57 - 51:01)
giving an event for it three-hour (50:59 - 51:03)
special time merrill increase the shiny (51:01 - 51:06)
rates get people to play don't you also (51:03 - 51:10)
think at like the core system that you (51:06 - 51:14)
want to I don't know maybe have the (51:10 - 51:17)
format that people at least have vocally (51:14 - 51:19)
expressed that they liked the most which (51:17 - 51:23)
is great League and not the format where (51:19 - 51:27)
most maybe I'm in a bubble but most like (51:23 - 51:29)
everyone around me no one has told me (51:27 - 51:31)
they loved Master League I love Master (51:29 - 51:37)
Li do not fraud burst your bubble I just (51:31 - 51:39)
think like first impressions go a pretty (51:37 - 51:41)
long way and this is my first impression (51:39 - 51:45)
of lera there whatever new system rolled (51:41 - 51:47)
out go battle League leaderboard it will (51:45 - 51:49)
show the top 500 trainers around the (51:47 - 51:51)
world with their trainer nickname team (51:49 - 51:54)
rank and total matches that's all the (51:51 - 51:57)
Pokemon news I got that's it what is (51:54 - 52:00)

gotcha game for card fight Vanguard (52:43 - 52:48)
which has doubly reinforced for me my (52:45 - 52:51)
lack of interest in playing any kind of (52:48 - 52:54)
gotcha game at all is it do you like it (52:51 - 52:57)
more or less than Pokemon masters (52:54 - 53:00)
equally at the bottom of the barrel (52:57 - 53:02)

noises and the people screaming at me in (53:16 - 53:25)
Japanese and it's like we've got the (53:18 - 53:27)

Tetsuo (54:34 - 54:38)
question of the week if you could (54:35 - 54:43)
develop your own pokemon game which (54:38 - 54:48)
region would you put it in queries like (54:43 - 54:54)
these Kapost it in slack and become the (54:48 - 55:00)
question of the we (54:54 - 55:00)
[Music] (55:02 - 55:08)
I really messed up my levels for the (55:06 - 55:09)
week (55:08 - 55:14)
I know it was that the question or is (55:09 - 55:16)
that just the slide it's just the song I (55:14 - 55:17)
don't know the question that's your job (55:16 - 55:18)
okay (55:17 - 55:21)
this is from Robert in slack it says (55:18 - 55:23)
what makes the best breeding area and (55:21 - 55:25)
what location has come closest to the (55:23 - 55:29)
Pokemon games by it uh what makes the (55:25 - 55:31)
best breeding area what location has (55:29 - 55:34)
come the close in the Pokemon so when (55:31 - 55:36)
breeding what does your ideal location (55:34 - 55:41)
look like a Long's like so if I can go (55:36 - 55:43)
just in a circle and come back around (55:41 - 55:45)
what was this it was that X&Y that you (55:43 - 55:47)
could do that in the city was there a (55:45 - 55:50)
brain oh no no no oh maybe alpha (55:47 - 55:52)
sapphire had it yeah best they were (55:50 - 55:54)
island that was a square and you can (55:52 - 55:56)
literally just hold down the paddle and (55:54 - 55:58)
ride your bike around that square until (55:56 - 56:00)
the egg that's my idea you can go in a (55:58 - 56:01)
circle and when you complete the circle (56:00 - 56:03)
you're back to see if you have another (56:01 - 56:05)
egg Omega Ruby alpha sapphire had that (56:03 - 56:09)
on the island that is my ideal sword and (56:05 - 56:11)
shield has just a long bridge and they (56:09 - 56:16)
have to turn around that is now what do (56:11 - 56:18)
you do while the area is the best (56:16 - 56:21)
breeding cuz you can move the camera (56:18 - 56:23)
what are you even looking at I'm (56:21 - 56:25)
watching TV while going back and forth (56:23 - 56:26)

street from my house full of people (58:33 - 58:41)
waiting in line to get subpar food and (58:38 - 58:44)
that line for the drive-thru last night (58:41 - 58:47)
I am not kidding you 20 cars oh that's (58:44 - 58:52)
our Culver our Culver had like 17 cars (58:47 - 58:54)
waiting in that parking lot and they are (58:52 - 58:56)
slow Culver is slow because they have to (58:54 - 59:00)
like make the food and then run it out (58:56 - 59:03)
to your car I didn't mind the breeding (59:00 - 59:06)
area in black - white - they made a (59:03 - 59:09)
really really long path you just go (59:06 - 59:11)
zigzag back and forth (59:09 - 59:15)
paksy excellent wise is good for that (59:11 - 59:17)
bleeds nigh cuz you just went to the (59:15 - 59:19)
cave and came back and by that time you (59:17 - 59:22)
had neg still turning around (59:19 - 59:24)
that's an extra button push I don't need (59:22 - 59:26)
to do while I am reading subtitles in (59:24 - 59:28)
the current anime that I'm watching I (59:26 - 59:29)
don't know you give me you give me (59:28 - 59:30)
camera control I'm into that (59:29 - 59:34)
so sword shields my control freak even (59:30 - 59:36)
even when I was like playing you know (59:34 - 59:37)
games like destiny I would just be (59:36 - 59:42)
running around moving like that just the (59:37 - 59:47)
constant movement that's smooth is all I (59:42 - 59:50)
need to preoccupy myself I'm the person (59:47 - 59:52)
to final fantasy 14 that's like running (59:50 - 59:54)
a circle jumping over and over because I (59:52 - 59:56)
just need my character to move in some (59:54 - 60:01)
motion I'm aware or I was you stop (59:56 - 60:02)
playing yeah (60:01 - 60:06)
regrets real good I ain't going anywhere (60:02 - 60:09)
and I'm not filling you in on the story (60:06 - 60:12)
play it read out by the Cliff Notes (60:09 - 60:16)
version of that's it my days of (60:12 - 60:21)
supporting you are over we'll put one of (60:16 - 60:21)
the week (60:21 - 60:25)
I may have failed at this week's Pokemon (60:21 - 60:29)
of the Rica but locate last week Greg (60:25 - 60:35)
don't like it number one it has the (60:29 - 60:37)
ability (60:35 - 60:42)
where if one of another Pokemon faints (60:37 - 60:45)
its special attack goes up kind of weird (60:42 - 60:47)
ability there (60:45 - 60:50)
and its name is an anagram for anagram (60:47 - 60:53)
if you remove one letter what pokemon is (60:50 - 61:03)
it it's I think he guessed chatot last (60:53 - 61:04)
week to which I'm just gonna keep (61:03 - 61:09)
guessing chat loo (61:04 - 61:10)
I already did chat taught a few years (61:09 - 61:15)
ago so that's not coming back yep I (61:10 - 61:16)
think so (61:15 - 61:20)
raise your hand and not McGee Erna the (61:16 - 61:22)
answer is McGee or not correct (61:20 - 61:24)
major knows the only Pokemon that is (61:22 - 61:28)
able to learn moves by TM outside of the (61:24 - 61:31)
ones it learns through yell level up yet (61:28 - 61:34)
is unable to learn toxic or sleep talk (61:31 - 61:37)
what does that mean I don't it says I've (61:34 - 61:40)
Pokemon the other pokémon that can learn (61:37 - 61:44)
moves by TM can learn toxic yes and Wow (61:40 - 61:45)
but that the worst way to say it I don't (61:44 - 61:47)
know if that trivia stands true anymore (61:45 - 61:49)
cuz they remove toxic from so many (61:47 - 61:52)
Pokemon and sword and shield but can (61:49 - 61:54)
they learn it by TM let me decided TM me (61:52 - 61:59)
more yeah it's not TM anymore oh I mean (61:54 - 62:01)
I currently it's coming back in the (61:59 - 62:07)
expansion past the TM they're just doing (62:01 - 62:09)
that to get your money couldn't copy (62:07 - 62:12)
again with TM that yeah McGee knows the (62:09 - 62:15)
only just left it out me girls the only (62:12 - 62:17)
mythical Pokemon to be made available in (62:15 - 62:21)
the core series games through infinite (62:17 - 62:24)
activity event what does that mean that (62:21 - 62:25)
means that you scanned the QR code and (62:24 - 62:27)
Sun and Moon and you can get the MiG (62:25 - 62:31)
you're not given to you ah yeah it's (62:27 - 62:33)
