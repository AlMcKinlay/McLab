episode of the pokemon podcast it's (0:30 - 0:35)
super effective i'm your host sbj and (0:32 - 0:38)
with me today is greg (0:35 - 0:41)
hello my friends how was your week this (0:38 - 0:43)
week it's been a wonderful (0:41 - 0:47)
frigid on and off season so far are you (0:43 - 0:50)
enjoying your december in minnesota (0:47 - 0:52)
geez much like my instagram you're full (0:50 - 0:55)
of positivity right (0:52 - 0:55)
i don't like this (0:56 - 1:00)
why okay i have so nine we gotta be (0:57 - 1:02)
positive now so we can be negative later (1:00 - 1:06)
yeah nine inches of light snow fyi is (1:02 - 1:08)
not (1:06 - 1:10)
anything so (1:08 - 1:12)
y'all are like oh it was a terrible (1:10 - 1:14)
snowstorm no it was not we got more than (1:12 - 1:16)
nine inches down here yeah well south (1:14 - 1:20)
you got 11. north we got nine (1:16 - 1:22)
and it was light it's light dry snow i (1:20 - 1:24)
shoveled that like that just (1:22 - 1:25)
gone (1:24 - 1:28)
i can verify my snowblower works and it (1:25 - 1:30)
works great (1:28 - 1:30)
speaking of blowing snow will is here (1:32 - 1:36)
well i actually have some advice for our (1:34 - 1:39)
listeners that is not about the snow (1:36 - 1:40)
and it's not for all of our listeners (1:39 - 1:42)
too so for some of you this is going to (1:40 - 1:44)
sound like gibberish for some of you (1:42 - 1:46)
this is just going to be the golden (1:44 - 1:49)
words that you need to hear but at some (1:46 - 1:51)
point in your life you are going to be (1:49 - 1:55)
tempted drawn to encouraged to use the (1:51 - 1:59)
crochet provisional cast on do not do it (1:55 - 2:01)
there are other provisional cast ons (1:59 - 2:03)
that work much better and if you need me (2:01 - 2:04)
to point you in that direction just hit (2:03 - 2:06)
me up and i'll let you know don't don't (2:04 - 2:08)
do the crochet provisional it's a (2:06 - 2:10)
mistake (2:08 - 2:12)
okay (2:10 - 2:14)
we have a we have a lot of pokemon go (2:12 - 2:16)
news this week (2:14 - 2:18)
so we'll get to that probably after the (2:16 - 2:20)
break um and then we have some master (2:18 - 2:21)
stuff (2:20 - 2:23)
and some unite stuff because there's a (2:21 - 2:24)
holiday event (2:23 - 2:25)
uh (2:24 - 2:26)
and (2:25 - 2:29)
i guess we'll start with the diamond and (2:26 - 2:31)
pearl stuff i guess that let's start (2:29 - 2:33)
there what (2:31 - 2:35)
what is it there's stuff (2:33 - 2:40)
oh there's stuff this is off uh vg247 (2:35 - 2:42)
pokemon big sights (2:40 - 2:43)
now they're pretty big i mean they're (2:42 - 2:47)
bigger than us probably wow really (2:43 - 2:48)
uh (2:47 - 2:51)
vg247 pokemon brilliant diamond and (2:48 - 2:54)
shining pearl tops six million (2:51 - 2:59)
in sales this in a week the first week (2:54 - 2:59)
uh the cool thing here is they have the (2:59 - 3:03)
older games as well (3:00 - 3:05)
uh even with the mixed reaction from (3:03 - 3:08)
credits critics brilliant diamond and (3:05 - 3:10)
shining pearl have sold six uh have sold (3:08 - 3:12)
extremely well (3:10 - 3:14)
with over six million units worldwide (3:12 - 3:19)
between the first week uh per famitsu (3:14 - 3:22)
comparing that to (3:19 - 3:24)
let's go pikachu let's go eevee which (3:22 - 3:26)
only sold three million in its first (3:24 - 3:29)
week uh and then super smash brothers (3:26 - 3:31)
ultimate sold five million in its first (3:29 - 3:33)
week (3:31 - 3:34)
and then back in (3:33 - 3:36)
2019 (3:34 - 3:38)
sword and shield also sold six million (3:36 - 3:41)
copies in its first week pokemon x and y (3:38 - 3:43)
sold four million copies in its first (3:41 - 3:44)
week (3:43 - 3:47)
um and oddly enough pokemon sun and moon (3:44 - 3:50)
sold 7.2 million copies in its first (3:47 - 3:52)
week (3:50 - 3:52)
it's kind of crazy how sudden moon (3:53 - 3:58)
topped out at like 14 million (3:55 - 4:00)
and sword and shield is at like 23 (3:58 - 4:02)
million which is (4:00 - 4:03)
a lot more (4:02 - 4:05)
mm-hmm (4:03 - 4:06)
well (4:05 - 4:08)
people who had switches versus the (4:06 - 4:10)
number of people who had 3d (4:08 - 4:13)
what's the plural 3ds is 3ds still more (4:10 - 4:16)
3ds out there isn't there (4:13 - 4:19)
are there more like physical 3ds's that (4:16 - 4:21)
exist or more 3ds's that get plugged (4:19 - 4:22)
into the wall and allowed to charge (4:21 - 4:24)
their batteries any longer (4:22 - 4:26)
because that's a big (4:24 - 4:28)
divergence (4:26 - 4:30)
there there's no way there wasn't more (4:28 - 4:33)
3ds's out there in the world because the (4:30 - 4:35)
3ds was (4:33 - 4:37)
seven plus years old (4:35 - 4:40)
well yes but that was also that at the (4:37 - 4:41)
time where you were very clearly saying (4:40 - 4:44)
the 3ds is a horrible piece of hardware (4:41 - 4:46)
i hate it and you were preventing people (4:44 - 4:48)
from enjoying the pleasant experiences (4:46 - 4:49)
that they could have had on the 3ds (4:48 - 4:51)
because they just listened to you and (4:49 - 4:52)
think that it was like going to the (4:51 - 4:53)
point (4:52 - 4:56)
listen to me yes look seven years for a (4:53 - 4:59)
piece of technology is very old (4:56 - 5:00)
the computer i'm recording this on is (4:59 - 5:03)
about to turn seven years old you are (5:00 - 5:05)
correct (5:03 - 5:05)
where is link me to this article why do (5:08 - 5:13)
i see these numbers (5:10 - 5:15)
what is there to see i just read them (5:13 - 5:17)
yeah but (5:15 - 5:17)
you saying numbers just goes in one in (5:18 - 5:21)
out the other (5:20 - 5:25)
found it don't even don't even bother (5:21 - 5:27)
is this from is this joe did joe cite (5:25 - 5:30)
his (5:27 - 5:30)
no the six million (5:32 - 5:37)
copies is from famitsu (5:33 - 5:37)
i mean so (5:51 - 5:54)
i i (5:55 - 5:58)
cannot imagine (5:58 - 6:01)
so if if sword and shield sold six (6:01 - 6:05)
million let's go sold three x sun and (6:03 - 6:07)
moon sold seven point two (6:05 - 6:09)
diamond pro sold seven (6:07 - 6:12)
there's no way (6:09 - 6:14)
arceus sells more (6:12 - 6:17)
because there's only one copy (6:14 - 6:18)
like (6:17 - 6:21)
i would say what at least (6:18 - 6:23)
one out of 10 people are buying two (6:21 - 6:24)
copies (6:23 - 6:25)
and i'm being really i'm like being (6:24 - 6:26)
really generous because every time i put (6:25 - 6:28)
every time we do polls or every time (6:26 - 6:30)
like pokemon does polls or whatever it (6:28 - 6:32)
seems like it's like one out of three (6:30 - 6:35)
people actually buy two copies well (6:32 - 6:37)
i would say number of units (6:35 - 6:41)
correct number of people buying a copy (6:37 - 6:43)
is something different but i guess we (6:41 - 6:45)
are just counting units here so yes (6:43 - 6:48)
you are correct also i think legends (6:45 - 6:50)
arceus in its first week is going to (6:48 - 6:51)
suffer because (6:50 - 6:54)
it is not a traditional (6:51 - 6:57)
pokemon game traditional as that can (6:54 - 6:59)
vary through time and be big whatever (6:57 - 7:01)
but you know what i'm saying right uh so (6:59 - 7:04)
a lot of people are going to hold off (7:01 - 7:06)
until they hear from other people hey (7:04 - 7:08)
this is an incredible pokemon experience (7:06 - 7:09)
or (7:08 - 7:11)
oh my god just go get pokemon snap (7:09 - 7:14)
because legends are here it's not even (7:11 - 7:16)
worth your time well so let's look at it (7:14 - 7:19)
how many copies did pokemon snap (7:16 - 7:20)
sell (7:19 - 7:23)
like two million (7:20 - 7:23)
see but yeah but see there's some (7:28 - 7:31)
variants in there right because pokemon (7:29 - 7:33)
snap did not introduce new regional (7:31 - 7:34)
forms and (7:33 - 7:36)
pokemon legends arches is introducing (7:34 - 7:38)
the new original forms which even for (7:36 - 7:41)
the mildly informed about pokemon (7:38 - 7:44)
people know like if i want to experience (7:41 - 7:46)
this pokemon type (7:44 - 7:48)
i'm going to have to be involved in this (7:46 - 7:53)
game somehow so pokemon snap sold 2 (7:48 - 7:54)
million (7:53 - 7:58)
2.07 million units as of june 30th (7:54 - 8:01)
given that that that is by definition a (7:58 - 8:02)
side game (8:01 - 8:03)
uh (8:02 - 8:06)
i mean i would expect (8:03 - 8:08)
since legends argus is being sold as a (8:06 - 8:10)
slightly more traditional experience but (8:08 - 8:12)
not by much that we would see numbers (8:10 - 8:16)
only slightly higher than that (8:12 - 8:16)
yeah i mean legends has like (8:16 - 8:21)
the breath of the wild gimmick even (8:20 - 8:24)
though it might not exist it looks like (8:21 - 8:25)
it exists (8:24 - 8:27)
um (8:25 - 8:30)
it has new pokemon (8:27 - 8:31)
it is (8:30 - 8:33)
for at least the hardcore people that (8:31 - 8:35)
are like game freak always does the same (8:33 - 8:37)
thing i want we want something different (8:35 - 8:39)
like this is something different (8:37 - 8:42)
uh whether or not it's good (8:39 - 8:45)
remains to be seen (8:42 - 8:48)
uh and it's it's it's close it's like 45 (8:45 - 8:49)
days away at this point which is they're (8:48 - 8:51)
also we have to take into account (8:49 - 8:53)
shooting themselves in the foot by (8:51 - 8:56)
having it come out after christmas (8:53 - 8:58)
because yeah i know a number of people (8:56 - 9:00)
who are like (8:58 - 9:01)
i couldn't get (9:00 - 9:03)
diamond and pearl (9:01 - 9:05)
when it came out but i'm hoping to get (9:03 - 9:07)
it for christmas wherein uh (9:05 - 9:09)
nobody's saying i hope i get a gift card (9:07 - 9:12)
for legends for valentine's day january (9:09 - 9:14)
exactly it's a great valentine's day (9:12 - 9:17)
gift fall in love with pokemon all over (9:14 - 9:20)
again for valentine's day (9:17 - 9:24)
get legends arceus (9:20 - 9:24)
two like two million copies sold for (9:25 - 9:30)
pokemon snap is (9:27 - 9:33)
feels like it's good for a series that (9:30 - 9:35)
isn't pokemon (9:33 - 9:37)
like if i was like oh two million copies (9:35 - 9:38)
sold for (9:37 - 9:42)
stardew valley oh guys sold like 15 (9:38 - 9:44)
million over whatever (9:42 - 9:46)
but like (9:44 - 9:46)
like a million copy a million copies of (9:47 - 9:52)
a game sold is like very impressive for (9:49 - 9:54)
like any company wanting to like sell a (9:52 - 9:56)
video game right we i've talked about (9:54 - 9:57)
this before (9:56 - 9:58)
um (9:57 - 10:01)
but is it like numbers are so bad for me (9:58 - 10:03)
anymore because like i think about it (10:01 - 10:05)
and i'm like boy if i could get one (10:03 - 10:07)
dollar out of each copy of that two (10:05 - 10:09)
million copies that were sold i still (10:07 - 10:11)
can't afford the condo that i want on (10:09 - 10:12)
the upper west side (10:11 - 10:15)
of manhattan (10:12 - 10:16)
i'm still (10:15 - 10:17)
yeah i'm sure all the game developers (10:16 - 10:20)
are moving to upper manhattan (10:17 - 10:22)
so you would you would just you would (10:20 - 10:23)
think (10:22 - 10:26)
you you would think by the (10:23 - 10:28)
amount of people (10:26 - 10:30)
that you just meet on a daily basis that (10:28 - 10:32)
talk about pokemon right (10:30 - 10:34)
and i'm talking like running into (10:32 - 10:36)
somebody at a grocery store and being (10:34 - 10:38)
like oh you have a pokemon keychain my (10:36 - 10:39)
favorite pokemon game is pokemon snap (10:38 - 10:41)
you would just think of just like all (10:39 - 10:43)
these conversations we've had over 20 (10:41 - 10:45)
years with just random people that (10:43 - 10:47)
pokemon snap was like this greatest the (10:45 - 10:49)
greatest game ever invented and we (10:47 - 10:51)
should have a sequel (10:49 - 10:53)
to it and then that sequel comes out and (10:51 - 10:55)
it only like sells 2 million which is (10:53 - 10:57)
like silly to say because 2 million is a (10:55 - 10:58)
lot but like (10:57 - 11:00)
not compared to the other crazy numbers (10:58 - 11:03)
that pokemon does like 12 million for (11:00 - 11:05)
let's go pikachu let's go eevee 13 (11:03 - 11:07)
million for heart gold soul silver 15 (11:05 - 11:09)
million for black and white 23 million (11:07 - 11:13)
for sword and shield it's just like (11:09 - 11:14)
yeah you would you would just think it (11:13 - 11:17)
would have done better but like pokemon (11:14 - 11:19)
conquest only sold a million like side (11:17 - 11:22)
games (11:19 - 11:22)
don't sell as much yeah (11:22 - 11:25)
like (11:24 - 11:29)
they just don't and i think (11:25 - 11:30)
like (11:29 - 11:35)
i i also don't think pure numbers (11:30 - 11:38)
actually show success right like (11:35 - 11:40)
return on investment (11:38 - 11:45)
2 million copies if your game costs (11:40 - 11:47)
a third of what it costs to do (11:45 - 11:48)
[Music] (11:47 - 11:50)
a regular game is the exact same return (11:48 - 11:52)
on investment right (11:50 - 11:54)
like you got a third of the sales but it (11:52 - 11:56)
also costs a third of what it was to (11:54 - 11:59)
produce so the profit is (11:56 - 12:01)
the same yeah so it's hard to say like (11:59 - 12:03)
that's a bad number because we just (12:01 - 12:06)
don't know all the factors going into it (12:03 - 12:08)
it doesn't sound as impressive as a main (12:06 - 12:10)
series game but (12:08 - 12:12)
that doesn't that's not the only factor (12:10 - 12:14)
that businesses look at (12:12 - 12:16)
um and you know (12:14 - 12:18)
it got a lot of buzz a lot of people (12:16 - 12:20)
talked about it and that's (12:18 - 12:22)
that's the sort of (12:20 - 12:25)
intangible stuff outside of sales (12:22 - 12:27)
because only hardcore people and us on (12:25 - 12:30)
this podcast really care about sales (12:27 - 12:32)
numbers yeah and it's also not (12:30 - 12:35)
pure desire right because you just have (12:32 - 12:37)
to look over the past year how many (12:35 - 12:39)
people wanted to get a switch (12:37 - 12:40)
and couldn't because they just weren't (12:39 - 12:42)
in the stores right those sales could (12:40 - 12:43)
have been much higher (12:42 - 12:45)
if everybody who wanted a switch could (12:43 - 12:48)
get a switch (12:45 - 12:51)
um just some other game sales here uh (12:48 - 12:53)
mystery dungeon was 1.26 million for the (12:51 - 12:54)
switch (12:53 - 12:59)
wow i'm surprised you made that many (12:54 - 12:59)
uh pokken tournament dx was 1.38 million (12:59 - 13:03)
which is actually (13:02 - 13:06)
kind of impressive that pokken outsold (13:03 - 13:08)
mystery dungeon again i felt like i feel (13:06 - 13:09)
like mystery dungeon has that same aura (13:08 - 13:11)
around it where people are always like (13:09 - 13:13)
make a new mystery dungeon and it's like (13:11 - 13:14)
yeah but (13:13 - 13:16)
it's really just them it's just really (13:14 - 13:18)
just the people you there's clearly a (13:16 - 13:21)
million people who are buying them (13:18 - 13:23)
uh (13:21 - 13:26)
mario golf super rush 2 million pikmin 3 (13:23 - 13:30)
deluxe 2 million arms 2.38 million (13:26 - 13:34)
among us 3.2 million on the switch (13:30 - 13:36)
specifically (13:34 - 13:39)
i regret that i was one of the 3.18 (13:36 - 13:40)
million that bought one two switch (13:39 - 13:42)
because i couldn't possibly imagine (13:40 - 13:44)
nintendo would mess up that game and it (13:42 - 13:46)
was (13:44 - 13:48)
easily the worst money i've ever spent (13:46 - 13:51)
like it was one two switch was so (13:48 - 13:52)
terrible (13:51 - 13:54)
it was bad (13:52 - 13:57)
it was not good you got deceived bro (13:54 - 14:00)
lynx awakening which was a remake (13:57 - 14:02)
that also probably had the same (14:00 - 14:03)
complaints that diamond pearl had which (14:02 - 14:06)
is like why would i (14:03 - 14:09)
so spend money on this it sold 5.5 (14:06 - 14:10)
million (14:09 - 14:13)
interesting thing according to (14:10 - 14:15)
what i am sort of seeing (14:13 - 14:18)
roughly there were (14:15 - 14:22)
75 million 3ds units across the world (14:18 - 14:23)
and there are (14:22 - 14:27)
92.8 million switches in the world (14:23 - 14:27)
really yeah so switch is what five years (14:28 - 14:33)
old four yeah four (14:31 - 14:34)
five just turned five or we'll be (14:33 - 14:37)
turning five i think (14:34 - 14:37)
3ds is over 10 now (14:38 - 14:42)
yep (14:40 - 14:42)
i hated the 3d i'm well aware (14:42 - 14:49)
yeah i don't know why it was fine (14:45 - 14:49)
i just turned the 3ds the 3d part off (14:50 - 14:53)
because it hurt me yeah i mean that's (14:52 - 14:55)
part of the reason that's like i don't (14:53 - 14:57)
think i've ever used the 3d besides the (14:55 - 14:59)
first day (14:57 - 15:01)
you know what really jaded me on 3ds one (14:59 - 15:04)
i was one of those early adopters (15:01 - 15:05)
and i paid (15:04 - 15:07)
i paid however much and then i got the (15:05 - 15:10)
like brand ambassador whatever yeah i (15:07 - 15:11)
got out of those that's my favorite game (15:10 - 15:13)

avalog will appear in the center of the (21:30 - 21:37)

holiday seasonal costumes and gifts and (21:43 - 21:49)
stuff that you can unlock (21:47 - 21:51)
and uh (21:49 - 21:54)
the real news here is that (21:51 - 21:57)
they are adding more 40 skins the (21:54 - 21:59)
crustal skin (21:57 - 22:01)
of him being like a what a fruitcake or (21:59 - 22:03)
something is that what he's supposed to (22:01 - 22:03)
be (22:03 - 22:06)
uh i have to see it again but yeah i (22:03 - 22:09)
gotta look this up (22:06 - 22:11)
i'm pretty sure the crustal skin and the (22:09 - 22:13)
pikachu skin (22:11 - 22:15)
which is pikachu in like a santa outfit (22:13 - 22:17)
are both forty dollars (22:15 - 22:19)
yeah but does the pikachu have a hat (22:17 - 22:21)
that's that's what's in it oh yeah you (22:19 - 22:23)
better believe yeah okay yeah definitely (22:21 - 22:25)
has a hat very important uh where are (22:23 - 22:27)
the skins hold on (22:25 - 22:29)
this is the house i see one that's a (22:27 - 22:31)
crustal is a hamburger but i don't think (22:29 - 22:34)
that's official (22:31 - 22:34)
not with that dude (22:34 - 22:39)
i see one cramer finally getting a skin (22:37 - 22:40)
it looks like it's in the ten dollar (22:39 - 22:42)
range i think six thousand i think it's (22:40 - 22:43)
i think i saw six thousand eight hundred (22:42 - 22:46)
aos gems which is about ten bucks (22:43 - 22:47)
uh so (22:46 - 22:50)
pikachu isn't a santa outfit with a hat (22:47 - 22:54)
crustle is looks like a iced cinnamon (22:50 - 22:55)
bun (22:54 - 22:58)
oh cinnamon one okay with uh (22:55 - 23:01)
with a strawberry on top and bales (22:58 - 23:04)
uh craymaret is in a chef's outfit star (23:01 - 23:06)
likes his which is a really really good (23:04 - 23:08)
honestly the kramer and chef i mean like (23:06 - 23:09)
obviously i'm a huge cramer fan but his (23:08 - 23:11)
outfit is actually like legit like good (23:09 - 23:14)
like snorlax's is kind of boring yeah (23:11 - 23:18)
well so cramer it's really just got (23:14 - 23:22)
the hat and this cute bib and tie (23:18 - 23:24)
like it's pretty simple really but it (23:22 - 23:27)
simple works on cram how it's so he's (23:24 - 23:29)
still gonna get steve's money (23:27 - 23:32)
oh yeah uh mr mimes is just an apron and (23:29 - 23:34)
uh handkerchief (23:32 - 23:37)
and then multiple pokemon are getting (23:34 - 23:39)
hats (23:37 - 23:39)
and i don't know like what the (23:39 - 23:43)
requirement for getting this the the i'm (23:41 - 23:45)
going to guess that the basic (23:43 - 23:47)
hat is just probably something you (23:45 - 23:51)
unlock the rewards probably (23:47 - 23:51)
the the we'll we will never be able (23:52 - 23:58)
like i can't (23:56 - 23:59)
like (23:58 - 24:02)
the commentary around (23:59 - 24:05)
40 skins is never going to end (24:02 - 24:07)
well until they introduce 60 skates (24:05 - 24:09)
right this is the same thing in like (24:07 - 24:10)
apex (24:09 - 24:12)
and i've talked about how apex has like (24:10 - 24:14)
20 gun skins and (24:12 - 24:16)
you no one is going to see your gun skin (24:14 - 24:17)
because you will be dead before they (24:16 - 24:20)
ever reach you to look at your gun skin (24:17 - 24:22)
and if they took a second to look at (24:20 - 24:24)
your gun after you die they will also (24:22 - 24:28)
then die because apex is so fast (24:24 - 24:28)
and it gets compared and i'm not trying (24:28 - 24:33)
to justify like oh the 40 is fair it's (24:31 - 24:34)
not (24:33 - 24:36)
but it gets compared to like league (24:34 - 24:37)
where league i think is like what eight (24:36 - 24:40)
bucks for a skin or something (24:37 - 24:42)
the (24:40 - 24:42)
the sad reality is people are buying (24:42 - 24:45)
these (24:44 - 24:48)
well yeah i mean that's just been the (24:45 - 24:50)
sad reality for a lot of these things (24:48 - 24:51)
but (24:50 - 24:53)
it (24:51 - 24:55)
the the sort of (24:53 - 24:58)
math that happens with (24:55 - 25:00)
particularly since unite has been in in (24:58 - 25:02)
a weird place (25:00 - 25:05)
is (25:02 - 25:05)
how much is that hurting your core (25:05 - 25:10)
business right like (25:08 - 25:12)
when people is it's like when pokemon go (25:10 - 25:14)
was showing a lot of its flaws and (25:12 - 25:15)
people like why are you charging me (25:14 - 25:17)
money for this (25:15 - 25:19)
um like unite had to make and i think (25:17 - 25:21)
still has to make some big (25:19 - 25:23)
changes to its gameplay before people (25:21 - 25:25)
are looking at (25:23 - 25:27)
like i paid forty dollars for a skin for (25:25 - 25:29)
a game nobody plays anymore because the (25:27 - 25:31)
game is so bad (25:29 - 25:34)
um it's hard to sort of (25:31 - 25:37)
parse out where that line is going to be (25:34 - 25:40)
but when things are that expensive your (25:37 - 25:43)
game has to remain a very high quality (25:40 - 25:45)
so people who pay for that don't feel (25:43 - 25:46)
ripped off (25:45 - 25:48)
yeah and i think that's what apex has at (25:46 - 25:49)
least done well (25:48 - 25:50)
is (25:49 - 25:54)
like even though a gun will be 20 bucks (25:50 - 25:55)
obviously the whole game is free you (25:54 - 25:57)
don't have to buy the gun it's all (25:55 - 26:00)
cosmetic it doesn't do anything (25:57 - 26:03)
like they have continued every season to (26:00 - 26:05)
make improvements balance the game (26:03 - 26:10)
introduced new weapons change the map (26:05 - 26:10)
and (26:10 - 26:12)
it's like apex is almost three years old (26:10 - 26:16)
i think it turns three in like march (26:12 - 26:19)
and it continues to win awards and it (26:16 - 26:22)
continues to do very well on the charts (26:19 - 26:24)
of like most downloaded and they talk (26:22 - 26:25)
about how their player base is (26:24 - 26:28)
continuing to grow which is really good (26:25 - 26:30)
for a two plus year old game and that's (26:28 - 26:32)
the worry with unite is (26:30 - 26:34)
it doesn't seem like it's growing it (26:32 - 26:37)
seems like (26:34 - 26:39)
more and more people are just not (26:37 - 26:41)
interested in going back to it yeah but (26:39 - 26:43)
where (26:41 - 26:45)
because because is it fine in china (26:43 - 26:47)
because their money i hate to say it (26:45 - 26:49)
this way but their money is just as (26:47 - 26:50)
green as ours (26:49 - 26:53)
you know you know they may cut off (26:50 - 26:55)
development of the english language (26:53 - 26:57)
version and just make it chinese they (26:55 - 26:59)
could i mean yeah it depends on where (26:57 - 27:00)
where it's doing well (26:59 - 27:04)
um i mean i do think that they are (27:00 - 27:06)
going to try because i know that there's (27:04 - 27:08)
a huge (27:06 - 27:12)
balance update coming for (27:08 - 27:12)
a lot of (27:12 - 27:15)
things (27:13 - 27:19)
um that i'm hoping will (27:15 - 27:19)
alter the game to make more balance that (27:19 - 27:25)
people want to come back like (27:21 - 27:25)
yeah i mean one of the problems right (27:26 - 27:30)
now is lucario being able to like (27:27 - 27:31)
right (27:30 - 27:34)
solo the top lane by itself like it's (27:31 - 27:36)
interesting that i think in in the (27:34 - 27:37)
december (27:36 - 27:39)
notes like (27:37 - 27:43)
gardevoir is learning things earlier (27:39 - 27:45)
they've they've dropped the levels down (27:43 - 27:46)
of wind (27:45 - 27:48)
and same with mamoswine i think like (27:46 - 27:49)
they've dropped the levels of when you (27:48 - 27:52)
learn things to (27:49 - 27:53)
because they didn't make sense before it (27:52 - 27:56)
was so long before you got those things (27:53 - 27:57)
um (27:56 - 28:00)
and then you know the big ones the big (27:57 - 28:01)
problems are (28:00 - 28:03)
are taking a hit greninja lucario (28:01 - 28:07)
greedon and zara aura are (28:03 - 28:07)
you know (28:08 - 28:11)
be getting hit with nerfs and they need (28:09 - 28:16)
to be because you know they quickly made (28:11 - 28:18)
the game unfun (28:16 - 28:20)
and so we have to see again the weird (28:18 - 28:23)
thing is it's a cat like (28:20 - 28:26)
they made it such a casual game (28:23 - 28:28)
that (28:26 - 28:28)
i don't know that for the casual player (28:28 - 28:33)
who made it really hype for such a long (28:31 - 28:35)
time hearing that (28:33 - 28:38)
they fixed the bugs to make the game (28:35 - 28:40)
more fun draws you back if you treated (28:38 - 28:42)
it casually anyways like i think a lot (28:40 - 28:44)
of people found it easy to walk away (28:42 - 28:45)
from (28:44 - 28:47)
because it wasn't that compelling and it (28:45 - 28:49)
was kind of (28:47 - 28:52)
frustrating for a huge amount of time (28:49 - 28:55)
i do think that (28:52 - 28:57)
dragonite will drag some people back (28:55 - 28:59)
because that's such a hugely popular (28:57 - 29:03)
pokemon but i i don't know that (28:59 - 29:03)
finally fixing the balance of your game (29:03 - 29:08)
is enough to get people to come back (29:05 - 29:11)
yeah i'm agree if if they wait too long (29:08 - 29:14)
then lost is lost (29:11 - 29:14)
and it's been months since lucario has (29:16 - 29:21)
been (29:19 - 29:23)
so broken (29:21 - 29:26)
yeah and it's been a huge it's the same (29:23 - 29:28)
with venusaur who's been you know people (29:26 - 29:30)
are very frustrated with how that runs (29:28 - 29:32)
and that's not listed in the things that (29:30 - 29:33)
they're fixing (29:32 - 29:37)
um that i've seen at least (29:33 - 29:37)
yeah (29:39 - 29:42)
i mean (29:40 - 29:44)
do you did i i can see the like the (29:42 - 29:46)
thought process of okay well we're we're (29:44 - 29:48)
nerfing these three but let's leave (29:46 - 29:49)
venus are the same because we're (29:48 - 29:52)
boosting guard of war and garchomp and (29:49 - 29:54)
other things and maybe that will help (29:52 - 29:55)
balance specifically venusaur you don't (29:54 - 29:57)
want to take a character that right all (29:55 - 29:58)
the way to (29:57 - 29:59)
zero (29:58 - 30:01)
and that's maybe the worry with like (29:59 - 30:03)
lucario is just do people completely (30:01 - 30:04)
stop playing it (30:03 - 30:07)
um (30:04 - 30:07)
i mean in seeing what they're doing it's (30:07 - 30:14)
it's not he like it is a it is a nerf (30:11 - 30:16)
but it (30:14 - 30:18)
overall it doesn't (30:16 - 30:20)
sound like (30:18 - 30:21)
enough (30:20 - 30:23)
to undo it but (30:21 - 30:26)
you know we'll see (30:23 - 30:26)
it seems overall their christmas event (30:28 - 30:31)
seems good though yeah i mean the (30:30 - 30:33)
halloween event i will say this the (30:31 - 30:35)
halloween event was super fun (30:33 - 30:39)
when i played it for a while but not (30:35 - 30:39)
not like at logging every day yeah i (30:40 - 30:43)
like it every day because i want to do (30:41 - 30:45)
this like it was fun when people like (30:43 - 30:47)
let's play unite tonight let's do some (30:45 - 30:48)
of the snow events and i was like sure (30:47 - 30:50)
i'll i'll hop in and play it you know (30:48 - 30:53)
it's very that's a very casual map with (30:50 - 30:55)
a very silly mechanic sure i'll jump in (30:53 - 30:57)
and do it and this the winter one sounds (30:55 - 30:59)
the same like (30:57 - 31:02)
it sounds like a fun silly mechanic but (30:59 - 31:04)
they are competing with some big heavy (31:02 - 31:06)
hitter games around this (31:04 - 31:08)
time frame (31:06 - 31:09)
and (31:08 - 31:12)
i don't know if that is (31:09 - 31:13)
i don't know if they're going to see (31:12 - 31:15)
what they want to see because they i i (31:13 - 31:18)
this is there's a lot of competition in (31:15 - 31:21)
december for people's time yeah i think (31:18 - 31:23)
the the other thing that's like a little (31:21 - 31:25)
surprising is (31:23 - 31:29)
like unite did so well when it came out (31:25 - 31:31)
and it seemed to have pretty good (31:29 - 31:32)
momentum for the first month or so like (31:31 - 31:34)
more momentum than it feels like diamond (31:32 - 31:36)
and pearl has uh it just feels like (31:34 - 31:38)
people are just already over diamond and (31:36 - 31:40)
pearl to me at least i mean (31:38 - 31:41)
i know that i know somebody's like (31:40 - 31:43)
somebody's like i'm playing it right now (31:41 - 31:46)
yeah i get it i get it it just like also (31:43 - 31:48)
diamond we haven't it's hard to say that (31:46 - 31:49)
for diamond pearl because we haven't hit (31:48 - 31:50)
the holidays (31:49 - 31:52)
right like we'll we'll probably see a (31:50 - 31:55)
huge resurgence of people playing (31:52 - 31:57)
brilliant and also like the last week (31:55 - 31:59)
has been exam weeks for college kids and (31:57 - 32:01)
stuff so well also some of the things (31:59 - 32:04)
that people like like surprise trading (32:01 - 32:06)
and things don't exist in brilliant and (32:04 - 32:08)
the union room is still limited like (32:06 - 32:11)
the stuff that (32:08 - 32:13)
people use to play with other people (32:11 - 32:15)
that gets them excited don't really (32:13 - 32:18)
exist in that game right now (32:15 - 32:20)
you can go to the underground with eight (32:18 - 32:20)
people (32:20 - 32:22)
yeah (32:20 - 32:24)
hallway simulator (32:22 - 32:25)
um (32:24 - 32:27)
just the surprising thing is like it (32:25 - 32:29)
came out on mobile (32:27 - 32:31)
and i just thought that would be like (32:29 - 32:35)
this huge resurgence of new players and (32:31 - 32:36)
and it just (32:35 - 32:38)
seemed like (32:36 - 32:41)
at that point no one cared because they (32:38 - 32:43)
did not allow for controllers yeah that (32:41 - 32:46)
was 100 why i don't play it on mobile if (32:43 - 32:48)
i allowed controllers i played on my (32:46 - 32:51)
ipad yeah i played on my ipad too 100 if (32:48 - 32:53)
i could have controller use because i (32:51 - 32:55)
got a controller for my ipad finally i (32:53 - 32:56)
broke down and bought one (32:55 - 32:58)
and then found out you and i can't use (32:56 - 33:01)
it so i don't play unite on my ipad (32:58 - 33:03)
and i would i mean it's right there (33:01 - 33:05)
i could power it up while i'm on a work (33:03 - 33:07)
half way easier than anything else in my (33:05 - 33:09)
house but as somebody who played in a (33:07 - 33:12)
twenty thousand dollar tournament with a (33:09 - 33:15)
galaxy z full three because that's what (33:12 - 33:18)
they forced us to play on (33:15 - 33:21)
you learn real fast how to play (33:18 - 33:21)
it was it was fine um there was some (33:22 - 33:27)
things easier on the touchscreen of (33:25 - 33:28)
course (33:27 - 33:30)
versus the controller but then (33:28 - 33:32)
there were some things that were harder (33:30 - 33:33)
and (33:32 - 33:34)
there's (33:33 - 33:36)
i don't know how you there's no like (33:34 - 33:38)
best of both worlds but right at the end (33:36 - 33:40)
of the day i definitely preferred a (33:38 - 33:41)
controller (33:40 - 33:43)
um (33:41 - 33:43)
but (33:45 - 33:50)
it ran it it ran great on (33:46 - 33:51)
the samsung phone they sent me yeah i (33:50 - 33:55)
mean it looks beautiful on my ipad but i (33:51 - 33:57)
i can't play it with the controller and (33:55 - 33:59)
i don't want to hold my ipad awkwardly (33:57 - 34:00)
yeah that was that was probably my (33:59 - 34:02)
biggest problem is that the phone is (34:00 - 34:05)
heavier than a switch pro controller so (34:02 - 34:06)
you're like almost like you're getting (34:05 - 34:09)
like fatigue holding this device (34:06 - 34:12)
it's just it's not ideal and i would (34:09 - 34:14)
like because i have to hold it a certain (34:12 - 34:16)
way and so i have to hold it up or down (34:14 - 34:18)
like i with my ipad i can set it up like (34:16 - 34:20)
a tv screen (34:18 - 34:21)
and play with my controller and i could (34:20 - 34:23)
do it like that but i can't (34:21 - 34:25)
because it doesn't accept it (34:23 - 34:26)
yeah (34:25 - 34:28)
well uh i don't know i guess we'll (34:26 - 34:30)
circle back on unite when (34:28 - 34:32)
dragon night comes out or when this (34:30 - 34:35)
holiday event starts it's fun a lot of (34:32 - 34:36)
people are excited about dragonite (34:35 - 34:39)
coming out (34:36 - 34:41)
but you know (34:39 - 34:43)
i don't know if that's actually going to (34:41 - 34:45)
translate into people (34:43 - 34:47)
playing it in the same fever that they (34:45 - 34:50)
were oh you know what i did see this is (34:47 - 34:52)
a twitch thing but i saw that one of the (34:50 - 34:54)
biggest twitch streamers her name is (34:52 - 34:55)
lily pichu (34:54 - 34:59)
um she had an ad to play unite (34:55 - 35:01)
like they paid her (34:59 - 35:03)
to play it and she's obviously a huge (35:01 - 35:04)
league of legends player (35:03 - 35:07)
um on twitch (35:04 - 35:08)
and youtube (35:07 - 35:11)
uh but (35:08 - 35:12)
i don't know if that's their strategy (35:11 - 35:14)
now is like to go after these big i mean (35:12 - 35:16)
it's a good strategy honestly to go (35:14 - 35:19)
after these big legends players three (35:16 - 35:22)
yeah also got like a unite push as well (35:19 - 35:25)
if i recall properly (35:22 - 35:27)
but again but i don't think (35:25 - 35:28)
i don't think you're ever convincing a (35:27 - 35:29)
league of legend player like league of (35:28 - 35:31)
legends players already hate themselves (35:29 - 35:32)
i don't think you're going to be able to (35:31 - 35:35)
like convince them to play a pokemon (35:32 - 35:37)
game that's probably not nearly as good (35:35 - 35:40)
as league is (35:37 - 35:40)
and that's kind of the thing that people (35:40 - 35:45)
say with unite is like (35:43 - 35:48)
if it's your first moba (35:45 - 35:51)
it's a good introduction but there are (35:48 - 35:53)
better mobas out there the only draw (35:51 - 35:57)
here is if you love pokemon (35:53 - 35:57)
or or maybe you love losing to zapdos i (35:58 - 36:02)
don't know (36:00 - 36:02)
it's uh it's interesting (36:03 - 36:08)
i feel like unites just eventually going (36:06 - 36:10)
to be pokken tournament where the seven (36:08 - 36:11)
people in the world are very good at it (36:10 - 36:13)
and they play it at tournaments and (36:11 - 36:14)
that's it (36:13 - 36:17)
[Laughter] (36:14 - 36:18)
probably (36:17 - 36:20)
i mean at least pokken tournament is (36:18 - 36:21)
really fun to watch even though you (36:20 - 36:22)
haven't played it in like three years (36:21 - 36:24)
it's at least (36:22 - 36:26)
entertaining to uh watch it a highlight (36:24 - 36:27)
i mean (36:26 - 36:29)
i enjoy watching people play unite (36:27 - 36:31)
sometimes i think it's i watched you (36:29 - 36:33)
play unite yeah i was like i think it's (36:31 - 36:36)
enjoyable a little crammer (36:33 - 36:38)
uh but (36:36 - 36:40)
watching other people play it doesn't (36:38 - 36:43)
make me want to play it because i have (36:40 - 36:45)
experience with it where i'm like oh (36:43 - 36:46)
i'm (36:45 - 36:48)
the thing with united is even though the (36:46 - 36:50)
matches are short (36:48 - 36:54)
i still feel like (36:50 - 36:57)
this is a time commitment that (36:54 - 37:00)
i'm locked into for it for a chunk of (36:57 - 37:01)
time and i don't want to do that right (37:00 - 37:04)
now it's the weirdness of like i don't (37:01 - 37:06)
want to watch a full-length movie but i (37:04 - 37:10)
will definitely stream four 30-minute tv (37:06 - 37:11)
shows (37:10 - 37:13)
back-to-back but sitting through a (37:11 - 37:15)
two-hour movie no thank you i think it's (37:13 - 37:18)
that mentality of (37:15 - 37:20)
having natural breaks or being able to (37:18 - 37:22)
like with diamond and pearl i'm like i (37:20 - 37:25)
can just stop wherever i am and put the (37:22 - 37:27)
game down and walk away if i need to (37:25 - 37:29)
and i don't feel like you can do that (37:27 - 37:31)
unite (37:29 - 37:31)
all right let's take a break when we (37:34 - 37:38)
come back we have some pokemon go news (37:36 - 37:40)
and a little bit of pokemon masters news (37:38 - 37:43)
and uh we'll see how far will is in (37:40 - 37:46)
diamond and pearl so we will be right (37:43 - 37:47)
back (37:46 - 37:49)
that far (37:47 - 37:51)
this is my radar tutorial for youtube (37:49 - 37:54)
just shut up and do it (37:51 - 37:55)
if you spend more than two seconds (37:54 - 37:57)
thinking about it you're doing it wrong (37:55 - 38:00)
just move on (37:57 - 38:03)
keep going don't slow down (38:00 - 38:05)
pedal to the metal (38:03 - 38:08)
move move move (38:05 - 38:08)
and we are back from our break (38:09 - 38:16)
all right let's do uh let's do a diamond (38:13 - 38:18)
pearl check in will (38:16 - 38:22)
i'm on my way to pastoria (38:18 - 38:24)
city but the thing is (38:22 - 38:26)
being the person that i am (38:24 - 38:29)
greg don't give me that look (38:26 - 38:30)
is that (38:29 - 38:33)
that's the fourth gym right yes okay (38:30 - 38:35)
oh he's not behind (38:33 - 38:38)
once i got (38:35 - 38:39)
fly (38:38 - 38:42)
i flew back home to my mom's house and (38:39 - 38:45)
then like explored every part of the map (38:42 - 38:47)
that i had previously been to to see (38:45 - 38:49)
what things i could get to that i (38:47 - 38:52)
couldn't get to before using like (38:49 - 38:53)
cut and rock smash (38:52 - 38:56)
so that's what slowed me down um you're (38:53 - 38:59)
one of those people that i am 100 (38:56 - 39:02)
that person i mean (38:59 - 39:05)
after pastoria don't you get surf (39:02 - 39:07)
yeah i mean then i'll have to go back (39:05 - 39:09)
again because there's a lot of water (39:07 - 39:11)
features you should have waited (39:09 - 39:12)
no no no (39:11 - 39:14)
there's no waiting no no no no because (39:12 - 39:16)
then i get to level up my pokemon too (39:14 - 39:18)
because then i can just throw them (39:16 - 39:19)
against those little ones that give you (39:18 - 39:21)
a little bit of experience as you go (39:19 - 39:23)
right like i'm not going to put my (39:21 - 39:26)
ponyta against a (39:23 - 39:30)
level 25 geo dude but i'll go back (39:26 - 39:32)
and do like the level five geo dude and (39:30 - 39:34)
the ponytail until you get those levels (39:32 - 39:37)
60 geo dudes then you'll really be like (39:34 - 39:39)
whew wow i don't think ponita is going (39:37 - 39:40)
to be around anymore when we get to that (39:39 - 39:42)
point but (39:40 - 39:43)
who knows (39:42 - 39:45)
the amount of people that have come into (39:43 - 39:47)
my twitch stream and go (39:45 - 39:49)
man i'm really over leveled and then a (39:47 - 39:51)
day later come back going (39:49 - 39:54)
i can't beat cynthia (39:51 - 39:58)
yeah dramatically too high that game (39:54 - 39:58)
the (39:58 - 40:02)
i think the over leveling problem (39:59 - 40:05)
started in x and y (40:02 - 40:06)
because the experience share gave so (40:05 - 40:08)
much (40:06 - 40:10)
but x and y (40:08 - 40:12)
ha (40:10 - 40:14)
there there's like two sides of this (40:12 - 40:15)
coin and i don't think people see it (40:14 - 40:17)
unless they replay pokemon games a lot (40:15 - 40:20)
or they i don't know maybe just change (40:17 - 40:21)
their team once (40:20 - 40:24)
but x and y does give you a lot of (40:21 - 40:26)
experience so does sun and moon and all (40:24 - 40:29)
the other games but the second (40:26 - 40:31)
you grab a new pokemon and you want to (40:29 - 40:32)
level it up (40:31 - 40:34)
good luck because there's nowhere to get (40:32 - 40:37)
experience for the like i and the reason (40:34 - 40:39)
that that was very apparent to me is (40:37 - 40:42)
because i like did an egg lock (40:39 - 40:45)
and i think i i lost like five pokemon (40:42 - 40:47)
at clemont (40:45 - 40:48)
uh because he was like able to like (40:47 - 40:50)
charge his helium tile and then like one (40:48 - 40:52)
shot a bunch of my pokemon and then i (40:50 - 40:53)
was like okay no big deal i'll just you (40:52 - 40:56)
know i have all these pokemon in my box (40:53 - 40:59)
there's nowhere to level these pokemon (40:56 - 41:02)
up like literally nowhere to and before (40:59 - 41:04)
anyone says horde battles (41:02 - 41:06)
that that ain't happening in an egg lock (41:04 - 41:08)
you ain't really you ain't risking that (41:06 - 41:10)
and even if you did (41:08 - 41:10)
like (41:10 - 41:12)
the pokemon they put in horde battles (41:10 - 41:14)
just do not give you experience like (41:12 - 41:16)
you're better off like finding the level (41:14 - 41:18)
like nine autonomous will give you more (41:16 - 41:21)
experience than five they give you (41:18 - 41:23)
they don't give you experience (41:21 - 41:24)
yeah (41:23 - 41:27)
and that is the that is also the problem (41:24 - 41:29)
in newer pokemon game like if you don't (41:27 - 41:32)
change your team ever if you catch six (41:29 - 41:34)
pokemon maybe you change out a pokemon (41:32 - 41:36)
with like oh i'm level 45 but i found (41:34 - 41:38)
this level 40 crawler let me switch here (41:36 - 41:40)
you'll be okay (41:38 - 41:41)
but (41:40 - 41:43)
this is it's like the same problem in in (41:41 - 41:44)
diamond and pearl at a certain point (41:43 - 41:46)
you're like i don't know where to level (41:44 - 41:47)
yeah (41:46 - 41:49)
yeah and (41:47 - 41:50)
and i (41:49 - 41:52)
the underground does give you (41:50 - 41:55)
significantly more experience um so i i (41:52 - 41:58)
battled at level 60 tentacruel and it (41:55 - 42:00)
gave 2 000 experience and i was like (41:58 - 42:02)
okay let me just go above ground i found (42:00 - 42:05)
a level 30 tentacruel so i was like (42:02 - 42:07)
ideally you get a thousand and it only (42:05 - 42:10)
gave 200 experience yeah (42:07 - 42:12)
so the underground is giving you more (42:10 - 42:13)
experience (42:12 - 42:15)
but there is (42:13 - 42:17)
nothing fun (42:15 - 42:19)
about knocking out (42:17 - 42:21)
30 plus tentacruels (42:19 - 42:23)
just so you can battle cynthia that is (42:21 - 42:26)
your opinion (42:23 - 42:26)
it's not great i find that there's too (42:26 - 42:30)
many tentacruels in the world and the (42:28 - 42:32)
more that i can take out the better off (42:30 - 42:34)
everyone is whale's tentacle (42:32 - 42:37)
assassination club but again x and y had (42:34 - 42:39)
the same problem that's not a this is (42:37 - 42:41)
not exclusive to diamond and pearl (42:39 - 42:43)
sudden moon (42:41 - 42:47)
kind of had that problem until (42:43 - 42:49)
you get to the last island when you can (42:47 - 42:52)
like sos chansey (42:49 - 42:54)
um omega ruby alpha sapphire didn't have (42:52 - 42:55)
that problem at all because if you want (42:54 - 42:57)
experience let me tell you about blissy (42:55 - 42:59)
bases (42:57 - 43:02)
and sun or sword and shield sword and (42:59 - 43:03)
shield just (43:02 - 43:07)
the candy the candy's the greatest thing (43:03 - 43:08)
it's and to anyone that's like i don't (43:07 - 43:11)
like the candy it made it so easy cool (43:08 - 43:13)
don't use it then it's (43:11 - 43:16)
just it can sell it throw it away let me (43:13 - 43:18)
tell you if my option is battling 40 (43:16 - 43:21)
gastrodons or doing four max raid (43:18 - 43:23)
battles and then being able to bring (43:21 - 43:24)
like three pokemon up to the appropriate (43:23 - 43:26)
level i will do the max raid battles (43:24 - 43:29)
because they're more fun and there is (43:26 - 43:31)
nothing great about putting a benary at (43:29 - 43:33)
the start of your party going into a (43:31 - 43:36)
gastronom battle switching it out (43:33 - 43:37)
knocking out the gastrodon and then (43:36 - 43:39)
putting that on repeat it's just not fun (43:37 - 43:41)
anymore um it's the same thing with (43:39 - 43:43)
eevee training it's like (43:41 - 43:45)
well (43:43 - 43:46)
you could just use vitamins yeah you (43:45 - 43:47)
could just use vitamins and sometimes (43:46 - 43:49)
it's nice sometimes when you're trying (43:47 - 43:51)
to build a team for a tiny cup you don't (43:49 - 43:52)
want to battle (43:51 - 43:54)
25 rookies to get speed ev's sometimes (43:52 - 43:56)
you just wanna you you you earn the (43:54 - 43:59)
money somehow right i have the money let (43:56 - 44:01)
me buy the vitamins let me (43:59 - 44:03)
inject my pokemon with vitamins it's (44:01 - 44:05)
fine but (44:03 - 44:07)
you don't have to you can battle the (44:05 - 44:08)
rookies if you want (44:07 - 44:11)
the game has choices (44:08 - 44:12)
same thing with experience sure you (44:11 - 44:14)
don't want your pidgey getting (44:12 - 44:16)
experience share great open up your box (44:14 - 44:17)
and throw it in now it's not getting (44:16 - 44:19)
experience here you can access your box (44:17 - 44:21)
everywhere you just have to i think you (44:19 - 44:22)
just at least in diamond probably just (44:21 - 44:25)
have to beat the first gym leader (44:22 - 44:26)
it is (44:25 - 44:30)
i sincerely in a game that was like (44:26 - 44:33)
we're not in a faithful remake for the (44:30 - 44:35)
audio show i'm doing the air quotes (44:33 - 44:37)
for a faithful remake that then put (44:35 - 44:38)
bottle caps (44:37 - 44:39)
mints (44:38 - 44:43)
uh the ability patch but no candy (44:39 - 44:46)
and then (44:43 - 44:50)
gave us no way to get to a hundred to (44:46 - 44:51)
you (44:50 - 44:54)
candy baby the bottle caps i i don't (44:51 - 44:56)
know how (44:54 - 44:59)
how am i supposed to get to level 100 so (44:56 - 45:01)
you use the menu glitch to duplicate (44:59 - 45:04)
rare cases (45:01 - 45:04)
before they took it away (45:06 - 45:12)
i mean to be fair (45:08 - 45:14)
i think pickup picks up (45:12 - 45:16)
rare candies (45:14 - 45:19)
somewhat regularly i think pokemon has (45:16 - 45:21)
to be over 50 (45:19 - 45:23)
uh yeah or maybe 40 (45:21 - 45:25)
and then you have like a one percent (45:23 - 45:26)
chance of getting i mean my pacharis is (45:25 - 45:28)
grabbing all kinds of wild stuff i mean (45:26 - 45:30)
you do you do what we did back in the (45:28 - 45:32)
day when you're leveling something is (45:30 - 45:33)
you (45:32 - 45:35)
take the one that you're leveling and (45:33 - 45:36)
five pick up (45:35 - 45:39)
oh come on and you just reap in the (45:36 - 45:41)
rewards and hope you get rare candies to (45:39 - 45:43)
finish the way off yeah i have i've been (45:41 - 45:45)
playing this i think i've got (45:43 - 45:47)
70 hours in (45:45 - 45:50)
and my highest pokemon is 77. granted i (45:47 - 45:52)
haven't really been pushing (45:50 - 45:54)
because i've been doing other things but (45:52 - 45:55)
i was thinking about like if i had to (45:54 - 45:59)
get to 100 i don't know how to do this (45:55 - 46:01)
because (45:59 - 46:02)
experience (46:01 - 46:05)
experience slows down so much the closer (46:02 - 46:09)
you get to 100 and there's (46:05 - 46:11)
an underground caps by your badges so (46:09 - 46:13)
they'll only (46:11 - 46:14)
63 is like the highest (46:13 - 46:16)
highest (46:14 - 46:17)
and (46:16 - 46:19)
the underground still doesn't like (46:17 - 46:21)
showing you second and third evolutions (46:19 - 46:23)
if it doesn't have to (46:21 - 46:25)
like it's really happy showing you the (46:23 - 46:28)
gibbles and yeah again with the statue (46:25 - 46:30)
stuff like what do i gotta do to stop (46:28 - 46:32)
seeing jew dudes (46:30 - 46:34)
or or skroopy's like i feel like it's (46:32 - 46:36)
littered with skroopies well (46:34 - 46:38)
that's how they do (46:36 - 46:40)
the thing that i've heard is you fill it (46:38 - 46:43)
up with electric statues and you hunt (46:40 - 46:44)
pacharisu (46:43 - 46:47)
because pacharis is the best xp giver in (46:44 - 46:50)
the underground (46:47 - 46:51)
i would have never guessed that yeah i (46:50 - 46:52)
guess like (46:51 - 46:54)
because i was knocking out patrice he (46:52 - 46:56)
was giving me like with the lucky eight (46:54 - 46:58)
like 4 000 each time (46:56 - 47:01)
um but yeah like that's like the only (46:58 - 47:03)
trick is find a bunch of electric (47:01 - 47:06)
statues load them up and go to the area (47:03 - 47:08)
that pachariso (47:06 - 47:11)
pops in which isn't many and it's a rare (47:08 - 47:12)
spawn so you just keep going in and out (47:11 - 47:15)
until you find them (47:12 - 47:17)
knocking them out (47:15 - 47:19)
it's it is it is (47:17 - 47:22)
it is a grindy grindy grindy grindy (47:19 - 47:25)
grindy game (47:22 - 47:27)
it is (47:25 - 47:27)
i i i (47:29 - 47:34)
tweeted the other day that i think let's (47:31 - 47:36)
go pikachu let's go eevee is a better (47:34 - 47:38)
remake than diamond or pearl and i (47:36 - 47:40)
didn't read any of the responses i am (47:38 - 47:43)
sure people are arguing non-stop in the (47:40 - 47:44)
comments of that tweet (47:43 - 47:47)
i know it got like whatever (47:44 - 47:48)
but (47:47 - 47:50)
my (47:48 - 47:53)
my reasoning behind that is because (47:50 - 47:54)
even though let's go eevee let's go (47:53 - 47:57)
pikachu is an incredibly tiny game (47:54 - 48:00)
um there's only 150 pokemon it's (47:57 - 48:02)
relatively like kanto as a region is (48:00 - 48:04)
relatively small because it's the very (48:02 - 48:06)
first region it's very small (48:04 - 48:09)
there's there's not a lot to do after (48:06 - 48:10)
you beat the elite four right you can (48:09 - 48:12)
hunt the the four legends (48:10 - 48:14)
um well technically you can hunt three (48:12 - 48:16)
of them before you get to leave four but (48:14 - 48:18)
you can hunt the four legends there's (48:16 - 48:20)
the master trainer battles which is 150 (48:18 - 48:22)
unique battles but (48:20 - 48:24)
the nature of kanto let me introduce you (48:22 - 48:26)
to protect and toxic (48:24 - 48:28)
it'll win almost every single one of (48:26 - 48:30)
those battles (48:28 - 48:31)
um (48:30 - 48:33)
there's no breeding in the game right (48:31 - 48:35)
but the shiny hunting is really fun in (48:33 - 48:36)
that game (48:35 - 48:38)
and (48:36 - 48:39)
even though they increase the amount of (48:38 - 48:41)
trainers on routes (48:39 - 48:44)
um you can't battle wild pokemon which (48:41 - 48:46)
is still a weird argument that people (48:44 - 48:47)
are like i like battling wild pokemon (48:46 - 48:48)
instead of catching them it's like the (48:47 - 48:50)
only difference is you're using false (48:48 - 48:51)
swipe and you're throwing a pokeball (48:50 - 48:52)
instead of just throwing a pokeball i (48:51 - 48:53)
don't know what (48:52 - 48:54)
it's (48:53 - 48:55)
you're not reinventing the wheel here (48:54 - 48:57)
when it comes to catching pokemon (48:55 - 48:59)
um (48:57 - 49:00)
but the thing that let's go does that i (48:59 - 49:04)
just super appreciate it is (49:00 - 49:05)
it (49:04 - 49:08)
it did that it did the thing that no (49:05 - 49:10)
other pokemon game did in 22 years or (49:08 - 49:11)
whatever let's go came out which is put (49:10 - 49:14)
the wild pokemon in the overworld (49:11 - 49:16)
and you can see them and you can run (49:14 - 49:18)
away from them and that was such a huge (49:16 - 49:20)
thing (49:18 - 49:21)
that (49:20 - 49:22)
to me (49:21 - 49:25)
invoked an emotion of like (49:22 - 49:26)
feeling like i'm playing a pokemon game (49:25 - 49:28)
for the first time (49:26 - 49:31)
and it just felt (49:28 - 49:35)
like it to me it felt like moving from (49:31 - 49:38)
black and white to x and y and being (49:35 - 49:40)
like whoa these pokemon are in 3d i can (49:38 - 49:42)
move in every direction (49:40 - 49:44)
like (49:42 - 49:47)
it it just really felt so fresh (49:44 - 49:49)
and i think let's go pikachu let's go (49:47 - 49:51)
eevee is very delightful for what it is (49:49 - 49:52)
i don't think it's the world's best (49:51 - 49:56)
pokemon game but it took risks (49:52 - 49:56)
and (49:56 - 49:59)
the there's just so much charm that that (49:56 - 50:02)
game has like i had onyx follow me in (49:59 - 50:05)
diamond and pearl and it's this little (50:02 - 50:06)
tiny snake (50:05 - 50:09)
and it's like as tall as your character (50:06 - 50:12)
and i was like am i losing my mind isn't (50:09 - 50:14)
didn't in let's go pikachu let's go (50:12 - 50:16)
eevee not only was onyx (50:14 - 50:18)
correct size but you like (50:16 - 50:21)
sat on top of onyx (50:18 - 50:23)
yeah you could write like the snorlax (50:21 - 50:24)
where you kind of hugged it (50:23 - 50:27)
yeah my issue though my issue about (50:24 - 50:30)
leveling in (50:27 - 50:30)
let's go eevee (50:30 - 50:32)
is (50:31 - 50:35)
leveling costs money (50:32 - 50:37)
like you have to spend money on (50:35 - 50:39)
pokeballs (50:37 - 50:40)
to be able to level and (50:39 - 50:42)
whereas in every other game i can just (50:40 - 50:45)
go knock things out and that is a free (50:42 - 50:46)
experience (50:45 - 50:48)
thing for me (50:46 - 50:49)
and (50:48 - 50:50)
limited by (50:49 - 50:53)
how much i want to go back to the center (50:50 - 50:55)
to heal back up the thing that bothered (50:53 - 50:58)
me and let's go eevee is (50:55 - 51:00)
i had to pay (50:58 - 51:02)
granted they gave you a bunch of money (51:00 - 51:04)
but still i had to give money to get to (51:02 - 51:07)
get pokeballs to continue catching so (51:04 - 51:08)
that i could continue leveling because i (51:07 - 51:10)
had no other options unless i wanted to (51:08 - 51:13)
continually fight the elite four (51:10 - 51:15)
yeah that's like that's a big drawback (51:13 - 51:17)
for me about how those games run that (51:15 - 51:20)
that that was my only option and it cost (51:17 - 51:22)
in-game currency i also just remember (51:20 - 51:24)
the first time i was like oh i wonder (51:22 - 51:27)
what magikarp's walking animation is and (51:24 - 51:29)
like how it like flopped around you in a (51:27 - 51:30)
circle i was like oh my gosh this is (51:29 - 51:33)
like so adorable so cute (51:30 - 51:36)
and i also just don't remember (51:33 - 51:38)
walking through a wall and let's go (51:36 - 51:40)
pikachu let's go eevee it just it it (51:38 - 51:42)
actually worked (51:40 - 51:43)
it (51:42 - 51:45)
there (51:43 - 51:47)
like when i played it the sound just (51:45 - 51:49)
didn't randomly cut out and then i had (51:47 - 51:51)
to restart the game (51:49 - 51:53)
uh (51:51 - 51:53)
and i look at diamond and pearl (51:54 - 51:59)
the remakes (51:57 - 52:01)
and people are like well yeah there's (51:59 - 52:02)
more there's more things to do in (52:01 - 52:04)
postgame (52:02 - 52:06)
yeah i mean (52:04 - 52:08)
i guess i've probably spent five of my (52:06 - 52:11)
85 hours running in a hallway to (52:08 - 52:15)
different rooms yeah there's more to do (52:11 - 52:16)
but i i'm just (52:15 - 52:19)
i said this last week i'm just so tired (52:16 - 52:20)
of (52:19 - 52:21)
mining (52:20 - 52:23)
in walls (52:21 - 52:24)
to get (52:23 - 52:27)
another leaf stone i don't need any more (52:24 - 52:29)
leaf stones (52:27 - 52:30)
i do (52:29 - 52:33)
i have a (52:30 - 52:35)
all i get are fire stones (52:33 - 52:38)
and all i get is leaf stones it's just (52:35 - 52:40)
and then yeah it's it's it's the (52:38 - 52:42)
it's the repetitiveness all pokemon (52:40 - 52:44)
games are repetitive i understand i get (52:42 - 52:45)
this (52:44 - 52:47)
it's the repetitiveness of the (52:45 - 52:51)
mining the walls and getting the 17th (52:47 - 52:54)
lucario statue that i just don't need (52:51 - 52:56)
and then (52:54 - 52:59)
knocking out hound doom after hound doom (52:56 - 53:02)
after cacturn after skarupi (52:59 - 53:06)
and i'm not i'm not even level 85 yet (53:02 - 53:08)
and (53:06 - 53:08)
i wish (53:08 - 53:11)
that (53:10 - 53:14)
leveling candies were in (53:11 - 53:16)
the walls post game (53:14 - 53:17)
yes (53:16 - 53:19)
uh i wish (53:17 - 53:22)
i would find a rosalia statue in the (53:19 - 53:24)
walls of my game (53:22 - 53:26)
and not the 400 drift balloon that i (53:24 - 53:29)
have (53:26 - 53:29)
with omega ruby alpha sapphire (53:36 - 53:41)
i can't believe that (53:39 - 53:43)
we're coming full circle on this game (53:41 - 53:46)
this is the pokemon loophole of like a (53:43 - 53:48)
pokemon game is bad and then five years (53:46 - 53:50)
later you appreciate it no that game was (53:48 - 53:53)
great this is your loophole i loved it (53:50 - 53:55)
from the minute i have been on the (53:53 - 53:57)
bandwagon trying to tell you that you (53:55 - 53:59)
need to rethink your life choices (53:57 - 54:01)
and here you are (53:59 - 54:03)
five years later going oh yeah here's (54:01 - 54:05)
some things about omega ruby off of (54:03 - 54:07)
sapphire let's introduce like (54:05 - 54:10)
15 new megas green (54:07 - 54:11)
perfect like (54:10 - 54:14)
i love i loved almost all the megas that (54:11 - 54:15)
they introduced (54:14 - 54:16)
in omega okay i'm going to say this (54:15 - 54:17)
right now because we're not going to (54:16 - 54:19)
talk about it but (54:17 - 54:23)
the omega ruby alpha sapphire anime for (54:19 - 54:26)
evolutions is the best one they've done (54:23 - 54:28)
it is pretty good it's good it was weird (54:26 - 54:29)
though that they like (54:28 - 54:31)
released it (54:29 - 54:33)
and then just spoiled all of the megas (54:31 - 54:35)
because they kept them all a secret and (54:33 - 54:37)
they were like nah here they all are all (54:35 - 54:38)
at once (54:37 - 54:40)
that was a little weird at the time but (54:38 - 54:41)
that's fine (54:40 - 54:46)
the flying on latios latias (54:41 - 54:46)
great (54:46 - 54:49)
failed great loved it (54:46 - 54:50)
so (54:49 - 54:51)
i i could probably name a couple more (54:50 - 54:54)
things but those two things (54:51 - 54:56)
the hoops all the hoops (54:54 - 54:58)
those two things were like (54:56 - 54:59)
cool (54:58 - 55:01)
you did something great here (54:59 - 55:03)
and then for let's go pikachu let's go (55:01 - 55:04)
eevee it was (55:03 - 55:07)
all the pokemon following you and like (55:04 - 55:08)
yes following pokemon happened in heart (55:07 - 55:11)
gold soul silver was very basic but (55:08 - 55:13)
riding on onyx riding on lapras flying (55:11 - 55:16)
on dragonite flying on charizard um (55:13 - 55:18)
magikarp flipping and flopping you (55:16 - 55:20)
holding onto snorlax as you walk you (55:18 - 55:21)
riding persian like (55:20 - 55:22)
every (55:21 - 55:26)
pokemon had such a great like thoughtful (55:22 - 55:28)
animation and (55:26 - 55:30)
we all know that sword and shield was (55:28 - 55:33)
just copy and pasted not sure how they (55:30 - 55:35)
didn't if you have if you're listening (55:33 - 55:38)
to this podcast and you have not seen (55:35 - 55:41)
how atkins follows you (55:38 - 55:43)
in diamond and pearl (55:41 - 55:44)
please (55:43 - 55:46)
stop what you're doing pull over your (55:44 - 55:49)
car right now catch an eckens in diamond (55:46 - 55:51)
and pearl and then have it follow you (55:49 - 55:53)
and get back to me switch with me (55:51 - 55:55)
get back to me about copying pages then (55:53 - 55:57)
look at because look up the brick sounds (55:55 - 55:58)
eckens (55:57 - 56:00)
video because that that sells it right (55:58 - 56:03)
there it's like outstanding (56:00 - 56:07)
well i i i i'm so dumbfounded on how (56:03 - 56:10)
they messed up the first 151 animations (56:07 - 56:13)
were done in in let's go just ctrl c (56:10 - 56:16)
ctrl v have you watched have you watched (56:13 - 56:18)
the milotic one yet no i have not seen (56:16 - 56:22)
milotay have you seen gyarados (56:18 - 56:22)
it is (56:23 - 56:26)
it is shocking (56:24 - 56:31)
so that sun kern though (56:26 - 56:31)
i i i i hate being so like like look i'm (56:32 - 56:38)
like a hundred hours in diamond pearl (56:37 - 56:40)
i'm still playing it i got a shiny star (56:38 - 56:43)
skit yesterday it was very fun (56:40 - 56:44)
and and (56:43 - 56:45)
even though (56:44 - 56:47)
even though the game is buggy some of (56:45 - 56:49)
the bugs are incredibly funny and it's (56:47 - 56:51)
like and it's very hard to reproduce (56:49 - 56:52)
them i don't think i've ever had a bug i (56:51 - 56:55)
was able to reproduce twice in a row (56:52 - 56:56)
and they always make me laugh and they (56:55 - 56:59)
always make me smile (56:56 - 57:01)
and even a bad pokemon game is still (56:59 - 57:02)
very enjoyable (57:01 - 57:05)
except pokemon dash that game is awful (57:02 - 57:07)
but i can't (57:05 - 57:09)
i can't think of anything diamond and (57:07 - 57:13)
pearl has done that is like boy i hope (57:09 - 57:15)
they bring that back in a new pokemon (57:13 - 57:17)
game i think pokemon get fans get mad (57:15 - 57:20)
because a feature is introduced and then (57:17 - 57:22)
a game like like megas is a really good (57:20 - 57:24)
example people want people were bummed (57:22 - 57:25)
about sword and shield because it was (57:24 - 57:28)
missing megas people were bummed about (57:25 - 57:30)
diamond pro because it was missing megas (57:28 - 57:33)
people all were bummed (57:30 - 57:34)
well (57:33 - 57:36)
you gotta wait three years for people to (57:34 - 57:37)
you know (57:36 - 57:39)
appreciate dynamics (57:37 - 57:40)
um (57:39 - 57:44)
in in from omega ruby to (57:40 - 57:45)
sun and moon it's like oh dex nav is (57:44 - 57:48)
gone right like i i think it's very easy (57:45 - 57:50)
for a pokemon fan (57:48 - 57:52)
the only thing i would see is poker (57:50 - 57:55)
radar but like that was in the old games (57:52 - 57:58)
yeah they did contests dirty in this one (57:55 - 58:01)
they certainly did (57:58 - 58:02)
but (58:01 - 58:05)
like the big worry from so let's go to (58:02 - 58:06)
sword and shield and we talked about (58:05 - 58:09)
this on the show three years ago or (58:06 - 58:11)
whatever was oh are they getting rid of (58:09 - 58:13)
overworld pokemon because like that is (58:11 - 58:14)
the thing that they should have been (58:13 - 58:17)
keeping and they they did they they they (58:14 - 58:19)
pulled one over on us right they didn't (58:17 - 58:21)
show it in the first trailer they waited (58:19 - 58:22)
like three months after the first (58:21 - 58:23)
trailer to be like hey there are (58:22 - 58:26)
actually overworld pokemon (58:23 - 58:26)
what is diamond and pearl doing that (58:27 - 58:32)
like (58:29 - 58:32)
like they took a chance and you're like (58:33 - 58:36)
oh my gosh i'm so glad they did this i (58:34 - 58:37)
hope (58:36 - 58:40)
this is in the next pokemon game really (58:37 - 58:41)
and i get it it's ilka it's not game (58:40 - 58:43)
freak but (58:41 - 58:45)
if you're going to (58:43 - 58:49)
if you're going to like remake a game (58:45 - 58:49)
give like take a risk give me something (58:49 - 58:54)
no no no they were not allowed to take (58:52 - 58:56)
any risks (58:54 - 58:57)
um (58:56 - 58:59)
and i will say that the risks that omega (58:57 - 59:01)
ruby alpha set (58:59 - 59:04)
took were pretty safe of like okay new (59:01 - 59:07)
megas and here is here's the flying like (59:04 - 59:08)
everything in omega ruby alpha sapphire (59:07 - 59:09)
was (59:08 - 59:11)
was really safe but at least at least (59:09 - 59:14)
they tried to branch out a bit (59:11 - 59:16)
um (59:14 - 59:16)
i don't know it's just it's just (59:17 - 59:21)
frustrating that (59:19 - 59:23)
the (59:21 - 59:26)
beginning part of diamond and pearl for (59:23 - 59:29)
me was so grindy and so like hit your (59:26 - 59:30)
head against the wall of like i don't (59:29 - 59:32)
want to battle another trainer i know (59:30 - 59:34)
they have six magikarp i don't want to (59:32 - 59:35)
be here (59:34 - 59:38)
and then (59:35 - 59:38)
the elite four was a great moment (59:38 - 59:42)
the probably the strongest moment of (59:41 - 59:45)
that game is battling that elite four (59:42 - 59:48)
mm-hmm um and the visuals of battling (59:45 - 59:50)
the box legendary (59:48 - 59:53)
yeah uh diago palkiel were really great (59:50 - 59:55)
and then i was like okay post game (59:53 - 59:58)
always seems to redeem a pokemon game (59:55 - 60:00)
and the post game is just as grindy as (59:58 - 60:03)
the story was (60:00 - 60:05)
like if i could sum up this (60:03 - 60:07)
like i have always thought that heart (60:05 - 60:09)
gold soul silver is the most grindy (60:07 - 60:12)
pokemon game (60:09 - 60:13)
but now the diamond and pro remakes have (60:12 - 60:18)
really taken the cake snatched the crown (60:13 - 60:18)
they've come and said (60:18 - 60:23)
hold my orange juice (60:20 - 60:23)
and yeah i i (60:25 - 60:33)
i don't know i don't know how (60:29 - 60:33)
i don't know how this game looks in like (60:33 - 60:36)
six months (60:34 - 60:38)
see i'm curious how this game (60:36 - 60:41)
[Music] (60:38 - 60:45)
looks and what the plans are post arceus (60:41 - 60:46)
yeah (60:45 - 60:47)
that's going to be an interesting (60:46 - 60:50)
curious if anything (60:47 - 60:54)
is planned that we just don't know about (60:50 - 60:56)
about how those two things are going to (60:54 - 60:57)
interact (60:56 - 60:59)
and (60:57 - 61:02)
like they've already shown that there is (60:59 - 61:04)
the ability for it to read save data (61:02 - 61:07)
because we know with the mu and the (61:04 - 61:09)
jarazzi thing like it it that code is (61:07 - 61:11)
there i'm just (61:09 - 61:14)
curious what if (61:11 - 61:16)
i'm curious slightly hopeful that (61:14 - 61:18)
something about the games will change (61:16 - 61:20)
post arceus (61:18 - 61:22)
um (61:20 - 61:25)
i don't know what that is but i'm hoping (61:22 - 61:27)
there's something because i i do feel (61:25 - 61:28)
like (61:27 - 61:30)
given how (61:28 - 61:33)
brilliant diamond shining pearl plays (61:30 - 61:36)
that error's like oh that that seems so (61:33 - 61:41)
quick that arceus coming out in 45 days (61:36 - 61:44)
does not seem quick compared to (61:41 - 61:46)
how much you kind of want to be done (61:44 - 61:48)
with brilliant diamond shining pearl i (61:46 - 61:50)
can see that (61:48 - 61:53)
i also we talked about this i think on (61:50 - 61:55)
the mini series greg i wonder how many (61:53 - 61:57)
people get to cynthia (61:55 - 61:58)
lose (61:57 - 62:00)
try again (61:58 - 62:04)
lose and then go i'm done (62:00 - 62:04)
a non insignificant number yes i mean (62:05 - 62:10)
i've heard a couple of people who (62:07 - 62:11)
said (62:10 - 62:13)
they got very frustrated but it was the (62:11 - 62:15)
thing that they wanted to beat (62:13 - 62:16)
but (62:15 - 62:18)
had to do things very very specifically (62:16 - 62:21)
to be able to do that because (62:18 - 62:23)
over leveling and grinding just wasn't (62:21 - 62:24)
an option (62:23 - 62:27)
right like that was (62:24 - 62:29)
it's not easy to do so they had to come (62:27 - 62:32)
up with ways but i i think there is (62:29 - 62:34)
a (62:32 - 62:36)
good amount of people who i tried it (62:34 - 62:39)
twice i can't beat it i'm gone (62:36 - 62:39)
okay um let's take one more break before (62:46 - 62:51)
we get to pogo news i guess there's a (62:49 - 62:53)
lot (62:51 - 62:55)
there's a lot and then uh we will wrap (62:53 - 62:59)
up the show so we will be right back (62:55 - 63:28)

once you complete the research line you (67:01 - 67:05)
will get access to the second exclusive (67:03 - 67:08)
masterworks story which is intended for (67:05 - 67:11)
a long period of time (67:08 - 67:13)
this was a huge issue last time why did (67:11 - 67:15)
it get so bright in this room jeez (67:13 - 67:19)
sorry the sun came out um i'm like very (67:15 - 67:22)
pale now for the youtube videos now now (67:19 - 67:24)
yeah i've never been painted never so (67:22 - 67:26)
this this was a problem (67:24 - 67:29)
for some players last year because they (67:26 - 67:30)
bought the ticket with the intent of (67:29 - 67:31)
getting (67:30 - 67:33)
shiny mew that's what they wanted they (67:31 - 67:36)
paid money right the 11.99 they wanted (67:33 - 67:38)
the shiny mew and then they found out (67:36 - 67:40)
later (67:38 - 67:42)
that you had to be level 40 and you had (67:40 - 67:45)
to do this very long research task to (67:42 - 67:47)
get still working on it (67:45 - 67:50)
you would still get it right (67:47 - 67:51)
but (67:50 - 67:53)
um (67:51 - 67:53)
you would still get it but you had to (67:54 - 67:58)
like work for it which is again it's (67:56 - 68:00)
it's the difference in players you know (67:58 - 68:02)
some players are like oh they just hand (68:00 - 68:04)
out shiny so easy i just walked a game (68:02 - 68:07)
stop i get my shiny (68:04 - 68:08)
zygarde was like one of the last ones (68:07 - 68:09)
they did (68:08 - 68:11)
um and then other players were like i (68:09 - 68:13)
want shinies that are that like what (68:11 - 68:15)
happened to the victini that's not even (68:13 - 68:17)
a shiny but the victini and you know but (68:15 - 68:18)
you know you had to go (68:17 - 68:20)
beat two gems and then go to this island (68:18 - 68:24)
and get it (68:20 - 68:24)
i think my perspective has always been (68:24 - 68:28)
like (68:26 - 68:30)
i like the fact that like you had to (68:28 - 68:32)
do the quest like it was kind of a fun (68:30 - 68:34)
quest and yeah it was really long and (68:32 - 68:36)
tedious but (68:34 - 68:37)
i don't know it was it was fine it was (68:36 - 68:40)
like you're paying for content right (68:37 - 68:41)
like (68:40 - 68:44)
you want like a yes you're paying (68:41 - 68:46)
a game you want value out of the video (68:44 - 68:47)
game you're paying for (68:46 - 68:50)
um (68:47 - 68:50)
but we don't know what we're getting now (68:51 - 68:54)
now again before people again this was (68:52 - 68:56)
another problem last year people bought (68:54 - 68:58)
the thing and then they revealed later (68:56 - 69:00)
on that this was a very you had to be 40 (68:58 - 69:03)
this was very long you don't have to buy (69:00 - 69:05)
the ticket right now if we don't know (69:03 - 69:08)
what the masterworks quest line is we (69:05 - 69:09)
don't know how long it is we don't know (69:08 - 69:10)
what the requirements are we don't know (69:09 - 69:13)
what pokemon you get at the end (69:10 - 69:16)
yes you will get two free dollar ticket (69:13 - 69:19)
things early for pre-ordering early (69:16 - 69:21)
but if you're on the fence (69:19 - 69:22)
it's okay (69:21 - 69:25)
like i literally didn't buy my ticket (69:22 - 69:26)
until the day before (69:25 - 69:29)
the kanto event (69:26 - 69:30)
it's fine (69:29 - 69:31)
heck you could buy the ticket while the (69:30 - 69:33)
canto events started it was okay there (69:31 - 69:36)
was yeah yeah it's like unlike go fest (69:33 - 69:38)
they will have an unlimited number of (69:36 - 69:40)
tickets for this event so you do not (69:38 - 69:41)
have to buy it if you're a player that's (69:40 - 69:43)
like i'm going to buy it no matter what (69:41 - 69:45)
the masterwork research story is cool (69:43 - 69:46)
you're going to save like two dollars (69:45 - 69:48)
because you'll get the january research (69:46 - 69:49)
and you'll get the february research (69:48 - 69:52)
that's cool i'm not pre-buying this i've (69:49 - 69:54)

with all the raids that was go to her (74:35 - 74:40)
was it no not go to her it was uh go (74:37 - 74:43)
fest because it was that night oh right (74:40 - 74:44)
right right right right and it was like (74:43 - 74:49)
oh hoopa is doing all these legendaries (74:44 - 74:49)
um i think 11.99 is a good price (74:55 - 74:59)
wasn't it 14.99 last year i i feel like (75:02 - 75:08)
it was but it was awesome maybe it was (75:05 - 75:10)
it's (75:08 - 75:13)
i like that they do this (75:10 - 75:14)
you know this is something we've never (75:13 - 75:16)
really talked about in the show but um (75:14 - 75:18)
comes up pretty quickly (75:16 - 75:19)
frequently sorry (75:18 - 75:21)
is uh we have (75:19 - 75:22)
i get the question all the time of like (75:21 - 75:24)
what happens when pokemon go runs out of (75:22 - 75:26)
pokemon (75:24 - 75:28)
i don't (75:26 - 75:30)
think that's the issue i don't think (75:28 - 75:33)
that's the question you should be asking (75:30 - 75:34)
like (75:33 - 75:37)
they they drip feed pokemon (75:34 - 75:39)
so slowly (75:37 - 75:41)
but people are still playing the game (75:39 - 75:43)
very actively (75:41 - 75:44)
and (75:43 - 75:47)
there are just so many of like (75:44 - 75:48)
no one no one (75:47 - 75:50)
there's not a single person out there (75:48 - 75:52)
i'm so confident of this that stop (75:50 - 75:55)
playing pogo and then they said hey (75:52 - 75:57)
drudging is now live and they're like (75:55 - 75:59)
well i haven't played pogo in two years (75:57 - 76:01)
but i gotta get drunk again that person (75:59 - 76:03)
does not exist that person exists that (76:01 - 76:05)
person does not no no no there's like (76:03 - 76:07)
one person (76:05 - 76:10)
i'm not saying there's multiples (76:07 - 76:12)
i am saying that person (76:10 - 76:16)
exists i will stand on a rock that there (76:12 - 76:18)
is one person out there (76:16 - 76:20)
so that was what got them back in the (76:18 - 76:24)
one the the the person that i (76:20 - 76:24)
like (76:24 - 76:27)
like lives outside of my frame of (76:24 - 76:30)
reference but i recognize does (76:27 - 76:32)
present a significant portion of the (76:30 - 76:34)
pokemon go playing community (76:32 - 76:37)
last monday i was in a staff meeting at (76:34 - 76:40)
work and one of my co-workers said i (76:37 - 76:42)
just spent way too much money on pokemon (76:40 - 76:45)
go over the weekend and i'm like (76:42 - 76:47)
this dude has never played (76:45 - 76:50)
a console based pokemon game ever (76:47 - 76:53)
literally only plays pokemon go what is (76:50 - 76:56)
the obsession with playing pokemon go (76:53 - 77:00)
and he was like well i had to keep doing (76:56 - 77:03)
the zekrom and resharam raids because i (77:00 - 77:05)
needed to get the shiny ones so that i (77:03 - 77:08)
could trade them for perfect iv once and (77:05 - 77:10)
i'm like nobody or perfect whatever (77:08 - 77:14)
rating cp with the three six nine stars (77:10 - 77:17)
and like nobody needs that (77:14 - 77:19)
nobody needs that (77:17 - 77:21)
but for him like he is obsessed with (77:19 - 77:25)
having like perfect every single pokemon (77:21 - 77:27)
oh yeah perfect (77:25 - 77:29)
i i believe it like it's not good (77:27 - 77:30)
getting the most (77:29 - 77:33)
useless i'd rather collect beanie babies (77:30 - 77:36)
over perfect pokemon in pokemon go (77:33 - 77:37)
because at least then i've got something (77:36 - 77:41)
to put in my casket when i'm dead (77:37 - 77:44)
i'm writing that down yeah um (77:41 - 77:44)
i (77:44 - 77:46)
i think though like (77:44 - 77:48)
what happens when pokemon go runs out of (77:46 - 77:51)
pokemon is the game gonna die i think (77:48 - 77:54)
they i think niantic has proven (77:51 - 77:58)
that they can just create events (77:54 - 77:59)
and the events (77:58 - 78:01)
whether they're big or like even this (77:59 - 78:03)
dragon event (78:01 - 78:05)
like they introduce dread again (78:03 - 78:08)
they make vulpix spawn everywhere vulpix (78:05 - 78:09)
is not uh (78:08 - 78:11)
dragon sometimes you see a (78:09 - 78:14)
dragonair but like (78:11 - 78:16)
that is still exciting for people to be (78:14 - 78:18)
like i don't have a dragonite and now (78:16 - 78:20)
i'm seeing at least one or two dratini a (78:18 - 78:24)
day and i can find a wild dragonair like (78:20 - 78:24)
like the pokemon go community (78:25 - 78:30)
or player base i should say is so big (78:27 - 78:32)
but you really only hear from like the (78:30 - 78:34)
top one percent because they're so (78:32 - 78:37)
active and they're so vocal and they're (78:34 - 78:40)
so loud and they're they they think that (78:37 - 78:42)
all these events are boring and useless (78:40 - 78:44)
but if you just take a step back and (78:42 - 78:46)
talk to somebody who maybe plays pokemon (78:44 - 78:47)
go (78:46 - 78:49)
10 minutes a day and they don't put a (78:47 - 78:51)
lot of money in it but they love it like (78:49 - 78:53)
these events are so exciting and these (78:51 - 78:56)
events are why they play every single (78:53 - 78:58)
day and come back (78:56 - 78:59)
and that's like the difference between (78:58 - 79:02)
this and unite is pokemon go (78:59 - 79:06)
brings people back like they're like as (79:02 - 79:07)
you could say like this dragon event is (79:06 - 79:09)
useless but their events bring people (79:07 - 79:13)
back from time and time again like my (79:09 - 79:13)
my sister (79:14 - 79:18)
has (79:17 - 79:21)
only spent money on these big events she (79:18 - 79:23)
she is the first to spend 11.99 on this (79:21 - 79:25)
event and dedicate the whole entire day (79:23 - 79:27)
but she doesn't (79:25 - 79:28)
she doesn't spend twenty dollars a week (79:27 - 79:30)
on raid passes she doesn't right she's (79:28 - 79:32)
not level 40. well and she she doesn't (79:30 - 79:34)
have a million chinese she doesn't even (79:32 - 79:36)
know when community days are unless i (79:34 - 79:37)
text her and be like hey are you doing (79:36 - 79:38)
community and she's like i didn't know (79:37 - 79:40)
it was today (79:38 - 79:43)
well and there's also people like who (79:40 - 79:46)
who haven't been in since day one like i (79:43 - 79:48)
just let's say i just started dating (79:46 - 79:50)
somebody and he was like oh well you (79:48 - 79:53)
like to play pokemon go so (79:50 - 79:54)
it's something i want to do with you and (79:53 - 79:57)
then these events help him get pokemon (79:54 - 79:59)
that he didn't get access to before (79:57 - 80:01)
right and there will always be (79:59 - 80:04)
newcomers to the game it's an evergreen (80:01 - 80:04)
game (80:04 - 80:06)
is this how you're telling us we have (80:04 - 80:09)
somebody new to me well would you stop (80:06 - 80:09)
just you're announcing it formally on (80:10 - 80:14)
the show because now i expected a text (80:11 - 80:16)
at least a little heads up yeah geez (80:14 - 80:18)
come on so i think it's always trying to (80:16 - 80:20)
tell people because this came up it (80:18 - 80:22)
comes up in work (80:20 - 80:25)
at best you hear from 20 (80:22 - 80:28)
of your customer base at best 80 percent (80:25 - 80:31)
of anybody uses any product will never (80:28 - 80:33)
tell you a single thing (80:31 - 80:34)
about it they'll never talk to you about (80:33 - 80:36)
it they're quiet they just do their (80:34 - 80:39)
thing they come and go as they please (80:36 - 80:40)
so (80:39 - 80:42)
when we hear when we see people talking (80:40 - 80:46)
about things we are hearing from a tiny (80:42 - 80:47)
percentage (80:46 - 80:51)
of the people actually using the product (80:47 - 80:52)
um so i guarantee there are people who (80:51 - 80:54)
are like (80:52 - 80:55)
i only come back when there's something (80:54 - 80:57)
new introduced in the game because i can (80:55 - 80:59)
take it or leave it and like they are (80:57 - 81:00)
not going to be the people going on (80:59 - 81:03)
twitter complaining about this community (81:00 - 81:04)
day or (81:03 - 81:05)
this (81:04 - 81:08)
release schedule they are people like i (81:05 - 81:10)
i it is a thing that i do in my spare (81:08 - 81:12)
time i don't talk about it i have no (81:10 - 81:14)
desire to talk about it i don't listen (81:12 - 81:16)
to people talk about it i just it exists (81:14 - 81:18)
as a thing (81:16 - 81:20)
like there's a lot of games that i play (81:18 - 81:24)
that i do not do podcasts for fyi (81:20 - 81:24)
well until we start magic the gathering (81:28 - 81:31)
oh wait look you gotta get on tick tock (81:30 - 81:35)
to get my magic the gathering hot today (81:31 - 81:37)
that's not gonna happen i know that's (81:35 - 81:41)
why i don't send them to you (81:37 - 81:41)
uh we talked about the the holiday stuff (81:46 - 81:50)
last week right (81:48 - 81:53)
uh we did holiday stuff the bergmite and (81:50 - 81:56)
everything coming to go well i think so (81:53 - 81:58)
holiday related i think something that's (81:56 - 82:01)
very important is the fact that you can (81:58 - 82:04)
now save your own postcards and the (82:01 - 82:06)
postcards people send you because i know (82:04 - 82:08)
somebody who literally stopped playing (82:06 - 82:10)
go because they didn't want to lose the (82:08 - 82:12)
postcards that they had collected while (82:10 - 82:15)
they were in a foreign country (82:12 - 82:17)
interesting (82:15 - 82:19)
uh i have the postcard news here this (82:17 - 82:20)
holiday season we're excited to (82:19 - 82:22)
introduce the postcard book whenever a (82:20 - 82:24)
trainer sends a gift or a postcard from (82:22 - 82:25)
a location that is attached to a (82:24 - 82:28)
pokestop location from the gift was (82:25 - 82:29)
uh ever want to save the memory from (82:28 - 82:30)
locations that you or your friends (82:29 - 82:32)
visited you'll soon be able to do that (82:30 - 82:34)
by pinning postcards to your postcard (82:32 - 82:36)
book it will be released at the start of (82:34 - 82:37)
the holiday events which i think is the (82:36 - 82:39)
15th it starts (82:37 - 82:41)
you can access the postcard book in your (82:39 - 82:42)
item bag (82:41 - 82:45)
you can pin postcards (82:42 - 82:47)
the little pin will like be next to the (82:45 - 82:49)
open button (82:47 - 82:53)
it doesn't say how many you can pin (82:49 - 82:55)
i'm looking you can delete them after (82:53 - 82:57)
you pin them you can opt out with (82:55 - 82:59)
privacy stuff (82:57 - 83:02)
my i love this i think this is great (82:59 - 83:04)
there are there are definitely stops (83:02 - 83:07)
that like when i spin it like the door (83:04 - 83:09)

america i always think that like or the (83:09 - 83:12)
swipers or the spongebob like i always (83:10 - 83:13)
think those are like really fun to send (83:12 - 83:15)
because big people know sponge like (83:13 - 83:17)
people know spongebob versus like some (83:15 - 83:18)
random (83:17 - 83:21)
statue in like a downtown area that they (83:18 - 83:22)
probably won't get but oh i got like a (83:21 - 83:24)
spongebob one um (83:22 - 83:29)
i only send very specific people (83:24 - 83:31)

old dog on it because i took that (83:31 - 83:35)

keep it (83:38 - 83:40)
because you're in this you're in the (83:39 - 83:43)
elite club i i think i think that's (83:40 - 83:45)
great my only worry is that the postcard (83:43 - 83:48)
book can only hold like 20 postcards and (83:45 - 83:51)
then you have to pay (83:48 - 83:53)
to hold more we should have to put coins (83:51 - 83:55)
in it (83:53 - 83:55)
you can get 50 coins a day (83:58 - 84:02)
that's true you can't you definitely can (84:00 - 84:04)

uh the last bit of pokemon go news here (86:53 - 86:59)
is the power up stops which i've seen (86:56 - 87:01)
one of them i haven't done it yet (86:59 - 87:06)
uh i found one uh and i scanned it and (87:01 - 87:08)
it's like oh hey do the ar scanning and (87:06 - 87:09)
i'm like i'd have to go stand in traffic (87:08 - 87:11)
to get this so guess what's not (87:09 - 87:13)
happening (87:11 - 87:15)
yeah when i found it it was like uh you (87:13 - 87:17)
know it's like 14 degrees outside i (87:15 - 87:22)
am going to stay in my car uh never mind (87:17 - 87:23)
we're excited to announce power up (87:22 - 87:25)
pokestop feature to make use of the new (87:23 - 87:27)
ar mapping task introduced last year (87:25 - 87:28)
soon you'll be able to work with fellow (87:27 - 87:30)
trainers to complete ar (87:28 - 87:32)
tasks and ar experiences you'll be able (87:30 - 87:34)
to power up certain stops for a limited (87:32 - 87:37)
period of time with ar mapping tasks (87:34 - 87:39)
power up stops a different way and any (87:37 - 87:41)
trainers who spin a stop will earn extra (87:39 - 87:44)
rewards as more level 20 trainers and (87:41 - 87:46)
above perform ar (87:44 - 87:48)
scans of the pokestop the rewards from (87:46 - 87:50)
spinning it will increase and the (87:48 - 87:51)
pokestop will be powered up for a longer (87:50 - 87:52)
period of time (87:51 - 87:54)
powered up pokemon stops have three (87:52 - 87:56)
visually distinctive levels (87:54 - 87:58)
and they will level up as more trainers (87:56 - 88:00)
work together to scan the following (87:58 - 88:02)
requirements are as follow level one is (88:00 - 88:04)
five scans level two ten scans level (88:02 - 88:05)
three twenty five scans to scan a (88:04 - 88:08)
pokestop go to the pokestop or gym tap (88:05 - 88:09)
the three dots in the upper right you (88:08 - 88:11)
must be level 20 or above to complete (88:09 - 88:15)
the ar mapping tasks (88:11 - 88:15)
and uh (88:15 - 88:20)
be aware of your surroundings (88:17 - 88:20)
just like everything always every threat (88:20 - 88:23)
every (88:22 - 88:26)
news press release ends be aware of your (88:23 - 88:29)
surroundings (88:26 - 88:29)
the (88:29 - 88:32)
i know i i know people are weirded out (88:33 - 88:38)
about the ar scanning stuff (88:35 - 88:40)
what's weird about it (88:38 - 88:43)
there there was a stop there was a rumor (88:40 - 88:46)
at some point when it came out (88:43 - 88:48)
that you if you ar scan a stop then (88:46 - 88:50)
niantic can look at it and then niantic (88:48 - 88:51)
has the option to remove it i have (88:50 - 88:53)
talked to niantic about this oh they (88:51 - 88:56)
said they want you to believe i'd say (88:53 - 88:58)
that it's the opposite now they're like (88:56 - 88:59)
oh this stop gets a lot of people (88:58 - 89:02)
scanning it we better keep this one (88:59 - 89:05)
yeah um (89:02 - 89:05)
so what niantic told me (89:05 - 89:11)
when i talked to them about why the ar (89:08 - 89:12)
even exists in the first place and maybe (89:11 - 89:14)
this was in one of their press releases (89:12 - 89:15)
i don't know (89:14 - 89:16)
um (89:15 - 89:19)
is the reason that they are the ar even (89:16 - 89:22)
exists is to actually map out real world (89:19 - 89:24)
areas so (89:22 - 89:28)
when you use ar pokemon it works in the (89:24 - 89:29)
area better (89:28 - 89:31)
and there is (89:29 - 89:33)
if you go to their youtube (89:31 - 89:36)
there's like a there's like a commercial (89:33 - 89:39)
with like a pikachu it's like at a skate (89:36 - 89:40)
park it's at some skate park in (89:39 - 89:41)
california (89:40 - 89:43)
um that's like really really popular and (89:41 - 89:45)
there's like a battle happening there (89:43 - 89:48)
and they said that that was all because (89:45 - 89:50)
they they went there themselves and ar (89:48 - 89:53)
scanned the entire skatepark so when the (89:50 - 89:54)
pokemon are battling (89:53 - 89:57)
it's taking in account (89:54 - 90:00)
the actual like stairs and the rails and (89:57 - 90:03)
like the actual level and so by (90:00 - 90:06)
trainers scan i mean like (90:03 - 90:10)
it's no conspiracy there's no like what (90:06 - 90:13)
we are doing is building their map right (90:10 - 90:16)
as a player they're seeing where players (90:13 - 90:17)
are walking where players are playing (90:16 - 90:19)
what stops players are spinning like we (90:17 - 90:21)
are giving them data we have been giving (90:19 - 90:23)
them data since day one this is just (90:21 - 90:25)
another level of data so they can start (90:23 - 90:29)
building a real world based off our (90:25 - 90:31)
scans they're not using the scans to (90:29 - 90:33)
like remove pokestops they want data (90:31 - 90:34)
from us they don't want to remove (90:33 - 90:37)
anything from us (90:34 - 90:39)
um (90:37 - 90:39)
my problem with the scans is it just (90:39 - 90:43)
takes too long (90:42 - 90:45)
and sometimes (90:43 - 90:47)
like for me in in a very cold city right (90:45 - 90:49)
now (90:47 - 90:50)
i don't want to scan something outside (90:49 - 90:51)
in the snow (90:50 - 90:53)
i also don't know what i'm supposed to (90:51 - 90:54)
scan (90:53 - 90:55)
usually you're just supposed to walk (90:54 - 90:57)
around what to stop i mean it's easy (90:55 - 90:58)
when it's a statue right you just walk (90:57 - 91:00)
around the statue but sometimes it's (90:58 - 91:01)
like a (91:00 - 91:02)
building you know i can't how much do (91:01 - 91:05)
you want of this how (91:02 - 91:06)
how (91:05 - 91:08)
and sometimes it's a park sign and i'm (91:06 - 91:09)
like i've walked around this park sign (91:08 - 91:12)
four times so that (91:09 - 91:13)
i think the club (91:12 - 91:15)
to my house is a baseball field and i'm (91:13 - 91:19)
like what it's just a run the basis (91:15 - 91:19)
so they can remove it later (91:20 - 91:23)
it's usually just the rewards are just (91:24 - 91:28)
not good enough normally for me to do it (91:26 - 91:30)
like i think that the best reward they (91:28 - 91:31)
kind of give is like a puffin like i (91:30 - 91:33)
think a puffin is worth it (91:31 - 91:35)
i don't think pokeballs are ever worth (91:33 - 91:36)
it (91:35 - 91:37)
i just have a thing that says i've (91:36 - 91:38)
uploaded three things and they nev it (91:37 - 91:41)
never disappears i'm like go away (91:38 - 91:44)
yeah take them off my take them away (91:41 - 91:45)
take it i'd be (91:44 - 91:46)
[Music] (91:45 - 91:48)
i must well i mean we're we're all very (91:46 - 91:49)
close above america i'm sure mall of (91:48 - 91:51)
america has a bunch of these power up (91:49 - 91:52)
stands (91:51 - 91:54)
i am sure there will be 25 scans on (91:52 - 91:56)
community i'm sure of it (91:54 - 91:59)
but i'd be curious of like there's a (91:56 - 92:00)
stop down the street (91:59 - 92:02)
it's like a laundry mat or something i (92:00 - 92:04)
don't think that stop is ever going to (92:02 - 92:07)
get 25 scans it's like (92:04 - 92:07)
maybe i don't know you don't know who's (92:08 - 92:12)
who's a big player in your neighborhood (92:10 - 92:14)
i i do know what that stop is it's not a (92:12 - 92:16)
laundromat (92:14 - 92:16)
all right fair enough useful information (92:19 - 92:25)
[Laughter] (92:21 - 92:27)
i mean you could do it 25 times (92:25 - 92:28)
i think you're only allowed to do it (92:27 - 92:29)
like (92:28 - 92:31)
oh can you do it once every five minutes (92:29 - 92:33)
is that what they think no i think it's (92:31 - 92:34)
probably once a day (92:33 - 92:36)
because i have no idea how this is yeah (92:34 - 92:38)
i don't know making things up limit of (92:36 - 92:40)
scanning is um (92:38 - 92:42)
i don't think this is gonna like if you (92:40 - 92:46)
were if you were anti-ar scans (92:42 - 92:47)
i don't think this new feature is gonna (92:46 - 92:50)
be like oh now i'm for the ar scans i am (92:47 - 92:51)
still anti-ar scans because they're (92:50 - 92:53)
gonna take my they're gonna take my (92:51 - 92:55)
things away (92:53 - 92:56)
all right (92:55 - 92:58)
we went long this week so no question (92:56 - 92:59)
the week i'm sorry greg (92:58 - 93:02)
save your song (92:59 - 93:04)

out that means next week's song will be (93:07 - 93:12)
even better no that's not how it works (93:10 - 93:15)
this is the will anderson rule once i'm (93:12 - 93:17)
denied you get the bare minimum there (93:15 - 93:18)
you go (93:17 - 93:21)
there you go nice nice (93:18 - 93:22)

minimum will give us our pokemon of the (93:22 - 93:24)
week (93:24 - 93:27)
all right so last week i kept it very (93:24 - 93:28)
simple (93:27 - 93:31)
uh i think a lot of people did get it (93:28 - 93:33)
this time um this rock ground or rock (93:31 - 93:35)
electric pokemon which is very popular (93:33 - 93:38)
in sinnoh can evolve when it reaches the (93:35 - 93:40)
level that is one-third of its (93:38 - 93:42)
evolution's regional and national (93:40 - 93:45)
pokedex number um so you know a few of (93:42 - 93:47)
the hints there number one that it could (93:45 - 93:48)
be two possible types means that it has (93:47 - 93:51)
a regional variant and (93:48 - 93:54)
also the fact that it's regional its (93:51 - 93:56)
evolutions regional and national pokedex (93:54 - 93:58)
number are the same means that it has to (93:56 - 94:02)
be from kanto because everybody else got (93:58 - 94:04)
they have different sets of numbers for (94:02 - 94:05)
those two (94:04 - 94:07)
greg (94:05 - 94:09)

what steve is expressing he is mad that (94:24 - 94:29)
brilliant diamond and shining pearl do (94:27 - 94:31)
not have alolan forms in it even though (94:29 - 94:34)
there are pokemon that have forms and (94:31 - 94:36)
let's let's spend another half hour (94:34 - 94:39)
because i actually wanted them to not (94:36 - 94:41)
change the typing and i wanted it to be (94:39 - 94:43)
a faithful remake so that there would (94:41 - 94:46)
not be any fairy types in diamonds (94:43 - 94:49)
okay and i didn't get that (94:46 - 94:51)
i didn't get what i wanted so (94:49 - 94:54)
uh fyi (94:51 - 94:58)
got this little friend with me (94:54 - 94:58)

place it firmly in your cheek (97:25 - 97:30)
so that you don't (97:28 - 97:33)
have a bad reaction (97:30 - 97:34)
here we go (97:33 - 97:37)
over the history of the pokemon games (97:34 - 97:40)
when a new pokemon type is introduced (97:37 - 97:43)
older pokemon types are revised to (97:40 - 97:46)
incorporate the newly introduced type (97:43 - 97:48)
as examples when fighting type was (97:46 - 97:51)
discovered some normal type pokemon were (97:48 - 97:54)
reclassified as fighting type when fire (97:51 - 97:56)
type was added some normal type pokemon (97:54 - 97:59)
had their typing replaced with fire type (97:56 - 98:01)
along the same lines flying type (97:59 - 98:03)
replaced or was added to a number of (98:01 - 98:06)
normal types some previous normal types (98:03 - 98:08)
eventually even ended up as fire and (98:06 - 98:10)
flying types (98:08 - 98:12)
in this revisionist perspective of the (98:10 - 98:15)
national pokedex which is the first in (98:12 - 98:18)
pokedex order pokemon to have its type (98:15 - 98:20)
changed through the addition of a newly (98:18 - 98:22)
discovered type and not through the (98:20 - 98:26)
addition of a regional variant (98:22 - 98:26)
