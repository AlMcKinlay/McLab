[Music] (0:01 - 0:16)
[Applause] (0:16 - 0:22)
[Music] (0:16 - 0:22)
and we are back from our break (0:23 - 0:29)
um so uh (0:26 - 0:31)
look I'm I'm just gonna say it this is (0:29 - 0:34)
absolutely my favorite story in all of (0:31 - 0:36)
Pokemon (0:34 - 0:41)
uh games movies TV shows hands down my (0:36 - 0:43)
favorite story that they told (0:41 - 0:44)
ever (0:43 - 0:48)
tell me what you think the story is (0:44 - 0:48)
uh the story is about a bunch of kids (0:49 - 0:54)
who got bullied (0:51 - 0:56)
and they are perceived as the bullies (0:54 - 1:00)
well that's my first catching point (0:56 - 1:02)
okay so you don't like the story at all (1:00 - 1:05)
right Greg no I liked some of the story (1:02 - 1:06)
I just think the bullying aspect is just (1:05 - 1:09)
pure nonsense because they they start (1:06 - 1:12)
the game as bullies they're bullying (1:09 - 1:13)
penny (1:12 - 1:17)
they have taken over sections of the map (1:13 - 1:18)
where they are bullying people and not (1:17 - 1:20)
letting them pass and then we're (1:18 - 1:22)
supposed to be like oh because you were (1:20 - 1:24)
bullied before we feel bad for you like (1:22 - 1:27)
you became the thing that you (1:24 - 1:28)
were (1:27 - 1:31)
against and I'm not (1:28 - 1:34)
that's not really a great lesson (1:31 - 1:35)
um (1:34 - 1:38)
I think I think that you are right but (1:35 - 1:40)
the the I think the wrestle with that (1:38 - 1:42)
because they by the end of it they're (1:40 - 1:44)
like we became they talk about that they (1:42 - 1:47)
do a little bit they didn't like they do (1:44 - 1:49)
a little bit but also like (1:47 - 1:53)
the idea that nobody like the biggest (1:49 - 1:55)
institution in paldeo that literally has (1:53 - 2:00)
students from Toddlers to the elderly (1:55 - 2:00)
connection had a had a section of the of (2:00 - 2:05)
the student body leave and the entire (2:02 - 2:09)
teaching staff and director resign and (2:05 - 2:11)
everybody's like I don't know (2:09 - 2:14)
it changes all the time I guess I don't (2:11 - 2:16)
know where did team star come from (2:14 - 2:18)
nobody's talking about this our entire (2:16 - 2:20)
teaching staff left one and a half years (2:18 - 2:22)
ago (2:20 - 2:24)
and there's one person in the world (2:22 - 2:25)
that's like I think they have a secret (2:24 - 2:29)
you think everybody left (2:25 - 2:32)
every like if everybody in Pokemon go if (2:29 - 2:35)
all of Niantic resigned a year and a (2:32 - 2:37)
half ago and got completely replaced we (2:35 - 2:40)
would still be talking about it (2:37 - 2:42)
I mean yeah (2:40 - 2:46)
but it's like this is the weirdest (2:42 - 2:48)
like I like their characters I like the (2:46 - 2:50)
message of found friends at the end but (2:48 - 2:52)
I think if you're gonna bring up a (2:50 - 2:54)
subject like bullying you need to (2:52 - 2:56)
actually have something to say about it (2:54 - 2:59)
and that thing should make sense I think (2:56 - 3:01)
they absolutely do I think I think each (2:59 - 3:03)
character has a characteristic of of (3:01 - 3:05)
being bullied and why they were bullied (3:03 - 3:07)
yeah which is I think that's (3:05 - 3:09)
particularly new (3:07 - 3:11)
no I don't think so but I think it's (3:09 - 3:13)
incredibly relatable I think I mean it (3:11 - 3:16)
goes back it goes back to it goes back (3:13 - 3:19)
to uh arvin's like dog dying like if any (3:16 - 3:22)
if anyone had a pet hurt or or whatnot (3:19 - 3:24)
that is that is incredibly relatable (3:22 - 3:26)
um like I I relate to almost every (3:24 - 3:28)
single one of like (3:26 - 3:31)
like as as like here's the here's the (3:28 - 3:33)
thing like if you were in I think the (3:31 - 3:35)
story is relatable to literally everyone (3:33 - 3:38)
because if if you were if you went to (3:35 - 3:40)
school which I'm assuming everyone did (3:38 - 3:42)
listening to the show uh you were either (3:40 - 3:46)
a bully you were either bullied or you (3:42 - 3:49)
witnessed bullying and if if even if you (3:46 - 3:51)
were not bullied and you were not a (3:49 - 3:54)
bully and you you you cannot sit here (3:51 - 3:56)
listening to this program or tell me on (3:54 - 3:57)
this program that you did not witness (3:56 - 3:59)
bullying happening it's like a real (3:57 - 4:00)
thing (3:59 - 4:03)
oh I agree I I also I have said this (4:00 - 4:05)
before I think the closer you are to (4:03 - 4:07)
having experienced that the more (4:05 - 4:09)
relatable it is for you because I (4:07 - 4:12)
literally sat the entire time doing all (4:09 - 4:14)
that just rolling my eyes because I'm (4:12 - 4:15)
like (4:14 - 4:17)
come on (4:15 - 4:21)
really come on and that was my like it (4:17 - 4:23)
is (4:21 - 4:23)
like it was written in a way that I (4:23 - 4:28)
literally did I literally rolled my eyes (4:25 - 4:29)
every time they brought the bullying (4:28 - 4:32)
things up and again I'm a lot older than (4:29 - 4:35)
a lot of people playing this game and so (4:32 - 4:37)
people's experiences the closer they are (4:35 - 4:39)
and the fresher those memories are have (4:37 - 4:41)
a very different experience than I did (4:39 - 4:43)
with it which which was this whole thing (4:41 - 4:45)
is nonsense to me (4:43 - 4:48)
oh my gosh yeah I I I think the complete (4:45 - 4:51)
opposite like like even as even as uh (4:48 - 4:55)
guyakomo like like to go why why they're (4:51 - 4:56)
being bullied so like guy Como is being (4:55 - 4:58)
bullied because like of of music and (4:56 - 5:01)
musical taste and this was like really (4:58 - 5:02)
relatable to me because this was (5:01 - 5:04)
literally what I was bullied for in in (5:02 - 5:07)
11th grade and 12th grade was was my (5:04 - 5:09)
music taste and my music choice (5:07 - 5:12)
um like I went to a high school that was (5:09 - 5:15)
very big on like fish like if you were (5:12 - 5:18)
not listening to jam bands and and like (5:15 - 5:20)
if your favorite Pokemon was in cheruby (5:18 - 5:23)
you were a million percent bullied (5:20 - 5:25)
um into (5:23 - 5:27)
into Oblivion because of literally just (5:25 - 5:29)
your music taste (5:27 - 5:32)
um like Mela uh like I cannot relate to (5:29 - 5:34)
that because I'm not a woman but like (5:32 - 5:37)
being a tomboy and like being in the (5:34 - 5:41)
like uh you know woodworking class or (5:37 - 5:43)
being in like the mechanical class or (5:41 - 5:46)
being in um we didn't have the car thing (5:43 - 5:48)
automotive shop like auto shop we didn't (5:46 - 5:50)
like our school didn't have that but we (5:48 - 5:52)
had like like any (5:50 - 5:54)
at least I saw that like if you if you (5:52 - 5:57)
were the one woman uh in (5:54 - 6:00)
Woodworking Shop you were constantly (5:57 - 6:02)
made fun of it just and that's just what (6:00 - 6:04)
happened it sucked uh you have Atticus (6:02 - 6:08)
which I will argue to my to like Atticus (6:04 - 6:09)
and and guy come are not the same (6:08 - 6:12)
although they both probably shop at Hot (6:09 - 6:14)
Topic I understand that they both (6:12 - 6:16)
probably get their clothing and their (6:14 - 6:17)
merchandise at the same store but (6:16 - 6:20)
they're not the same like Atticus to me (6:17 - 6:22)
fits more into like (6:20 - 6:27)
The Goth slash Punk slash whatever scene (6:22 - 6:30)
but not related to music that's like (6:27 - 6:31)
different (6:30 - 6:34)
also the way they have Atticus talk is (6:31 - 6:36)
like (6:34 - 6:40)
I I I I yeah I I like definitely got (6:36 - 6:43)
bullied for that uh Ortega they do two (6:40 - 6:45)
things like the rich boy who doesn't fit (6:43 - 6:47)
in but also like the gay boy who doesn't (6:45 - 6:51)
fit in I I think that's fine (6:47 - 6:54)
um I think if they just went with gay (6:51 - 6:56)
which is a totally (6:54 - 6:58)
like easy thing to like that that people (6:56 - 6:59)
got bullied for that right like that's (6:58 - 7:01)
very easy to do (6:59 - 7:03)
um I think adding the rich thing and (7:01 - 7:04)
like yeah let's just do both here I (7:03 - 7:06)
think that was totally acceptable and (7:04 - 7:08)
fine and then Eerie again I can't (7:06 - 7:10)
directly relate to that because I'm not (7:08 - 7:11)
a woman but like (7:10 - 7:13)
um I think we all went to school with (7:11 - 7:14)
like (7:13 - 7:16)
some people go through (7:14 - 7:19)
um puberty before others and there are (7:16 - 7:20)
uh (7:19 - 7:23)
young girls or young ladies who get (7:20 - 7:27)
really tall really fast uh and some are (7:23 - 7:29)
really athletic and in this case they're (7:27 - 7:33)
doing like this is a really tall like (7:29 - 7:35)
girl who is very athletic and then got (7:33 - 7:37)
bullied for that like like they're all (7:35 - 7:39)
they're every single one is like (7:37 - 7:41)
somebody I went to (7:39 - 7:44)
middle school high school college with (7:41 - 7:47)
and I can I can feel like I relate to (7:44 - 7:50)
like three of them spot on (7:47 - 7:50)
and I think other people can too yeah I (7:50 - 7:56)
I can't I mean I I kind of can but they (7:53 - 7:59)
all seem (7:56 - 7:59)
so many many years later they all seem (7:59 - 8:05)
very shallow depictions of of the issues (8:02 - 8:09)
like they are very light brush Strokes (8:05 - 8:12)
because they don't really like we're (8:09 - 8:13)
going to talk about the fairy type (8:12 - 8:15)
leader being gay but they don't really (8:13 - 8:17)
touch on what that experience is like (8:15 - 8:20)
at all like they sort of it's just it's (8:17 - 8:22)
just another thing that you're made fun (8:20 - 8:26)
of and it's like it's not really and I (8:22 - 8:29)
get it like it is a it is a game so (8:26 - 8:31)
they're not gonna do really deep Dives (8:29 - 8:34)
but also you could (8:31 - 8:37)
but instead they went very they sort of (8:34 - 8:40)
did very broad strokes and ultimately (8:37 - 8:41)
I'm like (8:40 - 8:42)
okay (8:41 - 8:45)
like seen it done it it's (8:42 - 8:49)
it is really shallow kind of relatable (8:45 - 8:52)
if I was a lot younger but I'm not like (8:49 - 8:55)
I want I want something way deeper than (8:52 - 8:57)
these (8:55 - 8:59)
I think that's fair I think it is very (8:57 - 9:02)
surface level (8:59 - 9:04)
um but I don't think that's necessarily (9:02 - 9:05)
necessary (9:04 - 9:09)
necessarily uh (9:05 - 9:12)
I amuse myself (9:09 - 9:14)
um I'm I'm with I'm with Steve on that (9:12 - 9:17)
like I I felt like it (9:14 - 9:21)
I felt affected by the storyline even (9:17 - 9:23)
though it was pretty shallow because (9:21 - 9:27)
like realistically (9:23 - 9:27)
as you say they're not going to go very (9:27 - 9:30)
deep into the individual stories I think (9:29 - 9:32)
it would have been nice though I think (9:30 - 9:33)
it would have been good like even if (9:32 - 9:35)
they had like side quests that would (9:33 - 9:36)
give you more information so you don't (9:35 - 9:38)
necessarily have to do it to get to the (9:36 - 9:41)
end of the the three storylines that (9:38 - 9:42)
would that would be cool uh maybe there (9:41 - 9:45)
isn't I've just missed that I'm not sure (9:42 - 9:50)
um I liked the the little kind of uh (9:45 - 9:50)
cut scenes you get after defeating each (9:50 - 9:55)
of them they kind of give you a bigger (9:53 - 9:57)
story and those are those are the bits (9:55 - 9:58)
that are definitely not told linearly (9:57 - 10:00)
because you get the one for whoever you (9:58 - 10:02)
just defeated (10:00 - 10:03)
um and it's quite I find that quite (10:02 - 10:05)
interesting getting those in in (10:03 - 10:07)
different uh (10:05 - 10:09)
different ways (10:07 - 10:11)
um so I yeah um I struggled a little bit (10:09 - 10:14)
with Ortega uh purely because it's like (10:11 - 10:17)
I feel I struggle to give people (10:14 - 10:18)
sympathy when they're like oh no I'm (10:17 - 10:21)
made fun of because I'm rich like yeah (10:18 - 10:23)
yeah sure right fine I'm sure that must (10:21 - 10:26)
be happening I really struggle with that (10:23 - 10:28)
yeah (10:26 - 10:30)
um uh I mean it's it in a way it's it's (10:28 - 10:33)
nice that that they got you know they (10:30 - 10:35)
they stuck by the other team Star (10:33 - 10:36)
members though even though they couldn't (10:35 - 10:39)
easily you know gone to like another (10:36 - 10:41)
school or move somewhere with all that (10:39 - 10:44)
money not to defend Ortega but I think (10:41 - 10:46)
there is that (10:44 - 10:48)
um (10:46 - 10:51)
I think I think there is a difficulty in (10:48 - 10:54)
that where like Ortega is is very (10:51 - 10:56)
self-aware that they're rich right like (10:54 - 10:58)
that that that that that that is obvious (10:56 - 11:01)
and I think with that it comes (10:58 - 11:03)
um the perspective of like are the (11:01 - 11:05)
people around me only around me because (11:03 - 11:08)
I am rich and I I think I think near the (11:05 - 11:10)
end of the game it's very obvious that (11:08 - 11:12)
gaikomo Mella Atticus and Erie are not (11:10 - 11:15)
around Ortega because he is Rich they (11:12 - 11:16)
are around him because they genuinely (11:15 - 11:19)
like him yeah that part of the story I (11:16 - 11:21)
liked a lot like if it had been much (11:19 - 11:24)
more focused on the friendship and a lot (11:21 - 11:26)
less about (11:24 - 11:28)
this weird bullying incident that (11:26 - 11:30)
happened a year and a half ago that (11:28 - 11:32)
everybody forgot even though it would (11:30 - 11:34)
have been a massive event (11:32 - 11:35)
um I would have been much happier with (11:34 - 11:37)
the story and I think ultimately that's (11:35 - 11:39)
the part that I focus on because I (11:37 - 11:42)
enjoyed it but of of them I just was (11:39 - 11:44)
like (11:42 - 11:47)
I I have seen this in every Pixar film (11:44 - 11:51)
since 2000 and they tend to do it better (11:47 - 11:54)
so yeah of course Pixar's get it too so (11:51 - 11:57)
like when I come to this and you're (11:54 - 11:59)
gonna when you make a storyline that (11:57 - 12:01)
exists in a world where things do it (11:59 - 12:03)
better you either do it different or you (12:01 - 12:05)
do it as well and I don't think they did (12:03 - 12:07)
either and that's my biggest problem (12:05 - 12:09)
with the bullying storyline I think they (12:07 - 12:11)
I think they do do a different (12:09 - 12:13)
um like (12:11 - 12:16)
they went out and they they made their (12:13 - 12:18)
own bases like they literally made their (12:16 - 12:20)
own safe spaces they set their own (12:18 - 12:22)
boundaries to protect themselves which (12:20 - 12:24)
is a is a real common story for in the (12:22 - 12:28)
gay community so like right like and and (12:24 - 12:31)
I and I I they they did that whether (12:28 - 12:33)
people realized it or not of like (12:31 - 12:35)
they're going to be protective of the (12:33 - 12:37)
space that they created and they're (12:35 - 12:38)
going to have (12:37 - 12:41)
um I mean in in this world the way you (12:38 - 12:42)
protect your safe space is Pokemon (12:41 - 12:45)
battles right like that that that's just (12:42 - 12:47)
like we we have we have people within (12:45 - 12:50)
our safe space that we trust and in (12:47 - 12:51)
order if you want to get into that you (12:50 - 12:53)
have to you have to have a Pokemon (12:51 - 12:54)
battle (12:53 - 12:55)
um (12:54 - 12:58)
and I think that's great I I also relate (12:55 - 13:02)
to the the fact that like they stood up (12:58 - 13:05)
to the bullies and the bullies ended up (13:02 - 13:08)
leaving or or transferring schools or (13:05 - 13:10)
whatever it was and they were then (13:08 - 13:11)
deemed the bullies like that that that (13:10 - 13:14)
was that is really relatable like that (13:11 - 13:16)
happened in my high school (13:14 - 13:19)
like that is that is a thing to do and (13:16 - 13:21)
for for I disagree with what Greg said (13:19 - 13:23)
of like (13:21 - 13:25)
everyone forgot (13:23 - 13:30)
my my school would rather have spent all (13:25 - 13:32)
of their resources trying to erase (13:30 - 13:34)
something bad that has happened instead (13:32 - 13:37)
of like actually addressing the correct (13:34 - 13:39)
issue this is the same thing I I have (13:37 - 13:41)
literally talked about time and time (13:39 - 13:44)
again in the Pokemon Trading Card Game (13:41 - 13:48)
judges and the the judges that you call (13:44 - 13:51)
over they would rather side with the (13:48 - 13:54)
bully than to actually have actually try (13:51 - 13:57)
to solve the issue like bullying is a (13:54 - 13:59)
huge thing in the TCG it is not people (13:57 - 14:02)
it is not people stacking their deck it (13:59 - 14:04)
is not people putting five cards in (14:02 - 14:06)
instead of four it's not people who are (14:04 - 14:08)
who are drawing eight cards instead of (14:06 - 14:11)
six the the the cheating that happens in (14:08 - 14:15)
the TCG is around people gaslighting you (14:11 - 14:17)
and bullying you into thinking that you (14:15 - 14:20)
made the wrong decision and they they (14:17 - 14:23)
they do that and then they call a judge (14:20 - 14:25)
and then they bully the judge they they (14:23 - 14:28)
Gaslight the judge into them being (14:25 - 14:31)
confident about a lie and you on the (14:28 - 14:33)
other side being like uh yeah I don't (14:31 - 14:34)
really know what's happening I don't (14:33 - 14:36)
understand his perspective and the judge (14:34 - 14:38)
wants nothing to do with it they will (14:36 - 14:41)
rather side with the bully like this is (14:38 - 14:43)
so relatable to me on so many levels and (14:41 - 14:45)
like I have a million percent understand (14:43 - 14:47)
like yep we don't know what happened (14:45 - 14:49)
everyone kind of left and like that like (14:47 - 14:51)
a million percent relatable that they (14:49 - 14:54)
try to cover it up and move on (14:51 - 14:57)
it literally happens in the Pokemon (14:54 - 15:00)
trading card game that's like the thing (14:57 - 15:03)
they they like like the history of (15:00 - 15:06)
competitive Pokemon the TCG the VGC they (15:03 - 15:08)
they spend more energy trying to cover (15:06 - 15:09)
up the bad things that have happened (15:08 - 15:11)
instead of trying to just address the (15:09 - 15:13)
issues it literally happens in this game (15:11 - 15:15)
it's so relatable (15:13 - 15:18)
and that's not even like I do yeah I (15:15 - 15:19)
think (15:18 - 15:22)
I feel like for this whole bit I'm I'm (15:19 - 15:23)
kind of in the middle of the two of you (15:22 - 15:25)
for this story bit right but I think I (15:23 - 15:28)
agree with both of you on that matter (15:25 - 15:30)
like I do think that it I don't think (15:28 - 15:33)
it's odd that they tried to cover up (15:30 - 15:35)
they tried to cover it up I absolutely (15:33 - 15:37)
agree that they tried to cover that's (15:35 - 15:40)
the part I believed I think that's the (15:37 - 15:41)
part I'm like oh yeah they absolutely (15:40 - 15:43)
would but those people in power wouldn't (15:41 - 15:46)
also just leave power (15:43 - 15:48)
yeah I think that that's a bit odd I (15:46 - 15:50)
also think it's a bit odd that we have (15:48 - 15:52)
like the first time you hear about this (15:50 - 15:53)
assuming that you you talk to them (15:52 - 15:56)
before you finish the story is a random (15:53 - 16:00)
like child on a Mountaintop says hey did (15:56 - 16:02)
you know that oh yeah (16:00 - 16:06)
and when I had seen which is a bit weird (16:02 - 16:09)
I had secretly hoped that nimono was one (16:06 - 16:12)
of their bullies right like (16:09 - 16:14)
like there would have to be a reckoning (16:12 - 16:17)
at the end something interesting and it (16:14 - 16:19)
didn't happen (16:17 - 16:20)
there's no way that we'd have done that (16:19 - 16:24)
but yeah oh I know that's like me that's (16:20 - 16:25)
like me thinking that there's a (16:24 - 16:27)
possibility the dog dies right yeah yeah (16:25 - 16:29)
I was gonna say that's like like I knew (16:27 - 16:32)
it wasn't going to happen I hoped it I I (16:29 - 16:34)
had hoped it would have (16:32 - 16:37)
uh we didn't talk about Clive great new (16:34 - 16:40)
character oh goodness (16:37 - 16:42)
can I just can I just say right (16:40 - 16:44)
uh (16:42 - 16:47)
for the people who are doing the whole (16:44 - 16:49)
thing they did with the Mast (16:47 - 16:52)
um uh what's it called the mast (16:49 - 16:54)
who's the fighter in Sun and Moon the (16:52 - 16:56)
masked the master Royale (16:54 - 16:59)
right you're doing the whole thing with (16:56 - 17:00)
that right trying to be like oh who's (16:59 - 17:02)
Clive in the game they tell you who he (17:00 - 17:04)
is (17:02 - 17:07)
don't do the thing twice (17:04 - 17:10)
I'll go with that that's fine it's still (17:07 - 17:13)
funny right can you get close in the (17:10 - 17:14)
game (17:13 - 17:16)
can you pick that hairstyle I don't know (17:14 - 17:18)
don't know (17:16 - 17:23)
shame DLC DLC DLC yeah I mean did they (17:18 - 17:25)
add like Rose's hair and DLC I think (17:23 - 17:28)
yeah they did yeah I think they did (17:25 - 17:30)
um I I think live showing up was great (17:28 - 17:33)
uh Penny showing up at the end was was (17:30 - 17:36)
of each interaction also great (17:33 - 17:38)
I liked (17:36 - 17:41)
those like I like the team star stuff I (17:38 - 17:43)
said this in my preview for the Nintendo (17:41 - 17:46)
stuff when I when I played early (17:43 - 17:46)
um (17:46 - 17:47)
like (17:46 - 17:51)
Nintendo was so strict around the team (17:47 - 17:53)
star stuff and to me it seemed like this (17:51 - 17:54)
was the story they cared about the most (17:53 - 17:56)
or the story that they were proud of the (17:54 - 17:58)
most because they were they they were (17:56 - 18:00)
not as strict for gym leaders to like (17:58 - 18:02)
they were like oh talk about grassy (18:00 - 18:03)
that's all you want like talk about (18:02 - 18:05)
cloth all you want (18:03 - 18:07)
um it made sense why they didn't want me (18:05 - 18:09)
to Chase cloth because (18:07 - 18:11)
oh yeah yeah obviously the second time (18:09 - 18:14)
you battle quaff you get the the karate (18:11 - 18:16)
on stuff but I already had it all like (18:14 - 18:18)
my my build was different like so it (18:16 - 18:19)
probably would have just broke if I (18:18 - 18:21)
chased cloth because (18:19 - 18:24)
you're all right you could you could do (18:21 - 18:25)
that in a way that it doesn't break but (18:24 - 18:27)
we all know that's not what that was (18:25 - 18:29)
gonna happen right right unless you (18:27 - 18:31)
played it on a PC I heard no it wasn't a (18:29 - 18:34)
piece (18:31 - 18:34)
hilarious so like (18:34 - 18:41)
the thing I wanted to talk about the (18:39 - 18:43)
most after the Nintendo preview was how (18:41 - 18:47)
Melo walked which in itself was great (18:43 - 18:50)
have either of you ever tried to walk in (18:47 - 18:54)
Boots that big no I think you know it's (18:50 - 18:56)
that big because those boots do not Bend (18:54 - 18:58)
if they're staying that stiff up I have (18:56 - 19:01)
done that it is not comfortable uh so (18:58 - 19:05)
but like the the (19:01 - 19:08)
that that was at the Nintendo preview (19:05 - 19:10)
event I saw the same cutscene after you (19:08 - 19:11)
fight Mella (19:10 - 19:14)
um and that cutscene screamed to me oh (19:11 - 19:17)
they're doing a bully storyline and the (19:14 - 19:19)
thing that all five of these people have (19:17 - 19:22)
in common is they've all been bullied (19:19 - 19:24)
and I there there's not enough (19:22 - 19:26)
information there right the first time (19:24 - 19:27)
you see that cutscene so I was like oh (19:26 - 19:30)
I'm curious of why they were bullied uh (19:27 - 19:32)
and then for me to find out like (19:30 - 19:35)
they stood up to their bullies and they (19:32 - 19:37)
quote unquote became the bullies then (19:35 - 19:39)
was relatable (19:37 - 19:41)
um because that happened in my school uh (19:39 - 19:43)
not me I was I was just always picked on (19:41 - 19:45)
so just full of disclosure I was just (19:43 - 19:46)
constantly bullied like I didn't become (19:45 - 19:49)
the bully or anything (19:46 - 19:49)
but um uh that was the thing I was most (19:49 - 19:55)
excited for uh and (19:53 - 19:58)
to me I I thought that (19:55 - 20:00)
they can mess this up so easily and I (19:58 - 20:02)
don't think they did I mean I can see (20:00 - 20:04)
Greg's point in like (20:02 - 20:06)
it was surface level or maybe wasn't (20:04 - 20:08)
like as as good as it was but I really (20:06 - 20:10)
don't think they dropped the ball at the (20:08 - 20:12)
end I think they did completely tell the (20:10 - 20:13)
story from start to finish and I think (20:12 - 20:16)
it had a really solid ending um at least (20:13 - 20:19)
to me I loved it I think they told I (20:16 - 20:21)
think they told the story and I think (20:19 - 20:24)
again the closer you are to to it the (20:21 - 20:27)
more relatable it relatable it is the (20:24 - 20:29)
further you are from it the absolute (20:27 - 20:32)
less relatable and the more nonsensical (20:29 - 20:34)
it is (20:32 - 20:37)
um and I don't I like I don't (20:34 - 20:39)
disagree that of the three it's a very (20:37 - 20:42)
it's a very solid plotline like it's as (20:39 - 20:44)
solid as arvin's (20:42 - 20:47)
um I just think (20:44 - 20:50)
it's written in such a way that unless (20:47 - 20:53)
you have a very direct tie to it it it (20:50 - 20:57)
feels nonsensical like it felt (20:53 - 20:59)
pretty much pure nonsense to me the (20:57 - 21:01)
entire time (20:59 - 21:04)
um and I think that is just how (21:01 - 21:07)
they wrote it right like they took a (21:04 - 21:09)
very shallow (21:07 - 21:11)
sort of this is the expected points (21:09 - 21:13)
these are the Beats you have to hit and (21:11 - 21:15)
they painted it by numbers (21:13 - 21:17)
um and you're going to experience that (21:15 - 21:20)
differently the more those numbers match (21:17 - 21:22)
up with your life (21:20 - 21:22)
uh yeah so the the at the end (21:23 - 21:29)
uh which led to (21:26 - 21:31)
um we'll talk about the battles in the (21:29 - 21:32)
fights I just want to like wrap the (21:31 - 21:36)
story up so you go through all five (21:32 - 21:40)
and then you get the uh you get the (21:36 - 21:43)
Clive revealing that he is the uh what (21:40 - 21:45)
he's the principal right is that his (21:43 - 21:48)
director (21:45 - 21:50)
basically the principal (21:48 - 21:53)
um and that you have to meet him in the (21:50 - 21:56)
the the square uh where he then reveals (21:53 - 21:59)
that he was uh Cassiopeia which my first (21:56 - 22:02)
question is you were standing there when (21:59 - 22:03)
Cassiopeia (22:02 - 22:05)
which I think Cassiopeia is a (22:03 - 22:07)
constellation or something right yeah (22:05 - 22:10)
well it's also a mythical Queen but yeah (22:07 - 22:11)
there's a lot (22:10 - 22:15)
um that I was like oh team star Greg I (22:11 - 22:15)
know (22:15 - 22:18)
like they didn't just name Cassiopeia (22:15 - 22:21)
the Cassiopeia because it's a bunch of (22:18 - 22:24)
stars relating to a specific person who (22:21 - 22:27)
was named they named though star that (22:24 - 22:30)
constellation after a specific person (22:27 - 22:34)
uh so so he then reveals that he's (22:30 - 22:36)
Cassiopeia which my first question is (22:34 - 22:36)
like (22:36 - 22:38)
well but you were standing there when (22:36 - 22:40)
Cassiopeia was talking to me which he (22:38 - 22:42)
then you know I say that out loud which (22:40 - 22:44)
then the dialogue says like oh I (22:42 - 22:46)
pre-recorded it yeah (22:44 - 22:48)
um you battle him and then after the (22:46 - 22:50)
battle he reveals that he isn't actually (22:48 - 22:53)
Cassiopeia and he was trying to get (22:50 - 22:55)
information which I really liked that (22:53 - 22:57)
twist because I I think (22:55 - 22:59)
I I think Pokemon does become super (22:57 - 23:02)
predictable and I like that even if it (22:59 - 23:05)
was just for a a second (23:02 - 23:08)
or in this case a full battle like I do (23:05 - 23:09)
like how he's like I'm just gonna say (23:08 - 23:11)
I'm Cassiopeia and you're like oh I (23:09 - 23:12)
thought it was I thought it was Penny (23:11 - 23:14)
the entire time I guess it's you and (23:12 - 23:15)
then at the end he's like it wasn't me (23:14 - 23:18)
and I was like oh you got me for at (23:15 - 23:20)
least a battle I did not fall for that (23:18 - 23:22)
one bit I'm like it was obvious it was (23:20 - 23:24)
Penny from the beginning (23:22 - 23:27)
and you protecting your student as (23:24 - 23:29)
you've done this entire time is also (23:27 - 23:32)
obvious this is I know it's not you and (23:29 - 23:34)
I know I'm going to face penny in about (23:32 - 23:38)
15 minutes like this is not a surprise I (23:34 - 23:40)
knew the minute this plot line started (23:38 - 23:43)
from the first phone call who this was (23:40 - 23:45)
I didn't (23:43 - 23:45)
um (23:45 - 23:47)
again I'm going to be in the middle I (23:45 - 23:49)
didn't actually know uh well I did (23:47 - 23:51)
actually know this but that was because (23:49 - 23:52)
I'd accidentally spoiled myself on this (23:51 - 23:54)
one story beat which was a bit (23:52 - 23:55)
frustrating you spoiled that so I don't (23:54 - 23:57)
know why I would have thought there is (23:55 - 23:58)
Penny yeah (23:57 - 24:00)
um so I don't uh this is the problem (23:58 - 24:02)
with writing up my lists before I play (24:00 - 24:04)
the game of yeah what to do in the game (24:02 - 24:06)
is you sometimes accidentally come (24:04 - 24:09)
across spoilers uh but yeah that's like (24:06 - 24:10)
the weird I did find the completely (24:09 - 24:13)
weird (24:10 - 24:13)
like I want to look at some stuff but I (24:15 - 24:19)
want to look at other stuff like when I (24:17 - 24:21)
was looking at stuff for Legends I was (24:19 - 24:22)
like oh yeah look at all these great (24:21 - 24:23)
Pokemon like that's all I want to see (24:22 - 24:26)
and then like I saw that Volvo had (24:23 - 24:28)
Giratina and I was like well (24:26 - 24:31)
I can't unsee that now (24:28 - 24:32)
yeah (24:31 - 24:34)
but I did find it really weird that (24:32 - 24:36)
you've essentially got like four reveals (24:34 - 24:38)
in a row so you've got to reveal that (24:36 - 24:40)
Clive is clavel then you've got the (24:38 - 24:43)
reveal that clavel is Cassiopeia and (24:40 - 24:45)
then you've got the reveal that clavel (24:43 - 24:47)
is not Cassiopeia and then you get the (24:45 - 24:50)
Revel real the pennies I love that whoa (24:47 - 24:52)
Whiplash (24:50 - 24:56)
that was so good nah I was just like can (24:52 - 24:58)
we just skip this part because this is (24:56 - 25:00)
pointless this is just another level (24:58 - 25:04)
check to get me to the end point can I (25:00 - 25:08)
just fight Penny please (25:04 - 25:08)
I I did enjoy the the clay the clavel (25:08 - 25:12)
fight though I think he was actually a (25:10 - 25:14)
reasonable challenge yeah yeah I I think (25:12 - 25:17)
ridiculously over level I think like (25:14 - 25:20)
he it was a good battle I think I think (25:17 - 25:22)
all the battles for team star were good (25:20 - 25:23)
battles (25:22 - 25:24)
um (25:23 - 25:26)
after I after my first one I knew what (25:24 - 25:27)
the pattern was and they weren't (25:26 - 25:29)
difficult after that when I had done one (25:27 - 25:31)
I'm like oh I know okay I know what (25:29 - 25:34)
happens so yeah I think I can take (25:31 - 25:37)
preparation going forward (25:34 - 25:39)
um but like (25:37 - 25:42)
again they didn't start like their (25:39 - 25:44)
plight lines are pretty much a stray (25:42 - 25:45)
straight line there's not a whole lot of (25:44 - 25:47)
M night shyama landing happening here (25:45 - 25:49)
I'm like it's it's what I thought from (25:47 - 25:51)
the minute this happened and yep we're (25:49 - 25:53)
right exactly where I said we were gonna (25:51 - 25:54)
be (25:53 - 25:56)
yeah I mean like I I think the clefell (25:54 - 26:00)
fight in itself was probably the best (25:56 - 26:02)
structured fight (26:00 - 26:05)
assuming (26:02 - 26:07)
hmm (26:05 - 26:11)
assuming that you are not incredibly (26:07 - 26:12)
over leveled (26:11 - 26:16)
I think I think it it is the it is the (26:12 - 26:20)
best setup fight so and let me expand on (26:16 - 26:22)
that uh so just uh I went through the (26:20 - 26:24)
whole game with with only water Pokemon (26:22 - 26:26)
I did a mono type water playthrough (26:24 - 26:29)
there's you know I tried to lean into (26:26 - 26:31)
new Pokemon there's a lot of old water (26:29 - 26:34)
Pokemon that exists like a Zuma roll or (26:31 - 26:36)
or or uh you know floatzal and stuff so (26:34 - 26:38)
I was there are a lot of new water (26:36 - 26:40)
Pokemon there's a lot of fish (26:38 - 26:41)
um but you know I didn't want to use (26:40 - 26:44)
aluminum anyways (26:41 - 26:46)
so for me (26:44 - 26:49)
um I didn't have a lot of instances (26:46 - 26:50)
where I was hitting super effective (26:49 - 26:53)
right uh or I was like resisting (26:50 - 26:54)
um there were there were a couple (26:53 - 26:56)
battles where I was just at a complete (26:54 - 26:59)
disadvantage which was like eono uh or (26:56 - 27:02)
or I guess brassius but brassius was (26:59 - 27:03)
um (27:02 - 27:05)
not a challenge because I had wing (27:03 - 27:06)
attack on the duck (27:05 - 27:08)
uh (27:06 - 27:11)
so for you know after battling the Elite (27:08 - 27:13)
Four and the other people after the (27:11 - 27:15)
Elite Four uh which we'll talk about (27:13 - 27:18)
next episode uh the clavel the clavel (27:15 - 27:20)
fight to me was the hardest not because (27:18 - 27:23)
he had you know super effective Pokemon (27:20 - 27:26)
I I just think he he had an actual (27:23 - 27:27)
strategy that he set up pretty (27:26 - 27:29)
successfully now obviously if you were (27:27 - 27:33)
to knock out his first two Pokemon (27:29 - 27:34)
um fairly quickly because I know some (27:33 - 27:35)
people are listening and they're like oh (27:34 - 27:37)
I didn't have a problem with it (27:35 - 27:40)
um you don't see that strategy (27:37 - 27:42)
um but if if you if you don't knock out (27:40 - 27:43)
those two Pokemon he'll start setting up (27:42 - 27:45)
reflex he'll start setting up light (27:43 - 27:47)
screens if if you if you break through (27:45 - 27:49)
that first one his Obama snow has a (27:47 - 27:51)
second chance of setting up reflects and (27:49 - 27:52)
light screens and why that's so (27:51 - 27:54)
important to the fight is because that (27:52 - 27:57)
allows the rest of his team to operate (27:54 - 28:00)
and like build that momentum that he's (27:57 - 28:03)
looking for uh which I think is kind of (28:00 - 28:05)
the opposite in the team star fights but (28:03 - 28:06)
I think they're still good (28:05 - 28:09)
uh where as like the other fights you (28:06 - 28:11)
know specifically some Elite Four stuff (28:09 - 28:12)
you can kind of see what they're going (28:11 - 28:15)
for but they don't specifically execute (28:12 - 28:18)
uh on that I think it's the same we'll (28:15 - 28:20)
talk about eona and why I think Eon is (28:18 - 28:22)
one of the strongest Gym Leaders (28:20 - 28:23)
um but (28:22 - 28:24)
yeah (28:23 - 28:27)
they care about what there's only one (28:24 - 28:29)
gym leader I care about oh yeah oh yeah (28:27 - 28:33)
that's it but but each gym leader does (28:29 - 28:34)
have some sort of strategy like all of (28:33 - 28:36)
almost all the trainers in the world (28:34 - 28:37)
have strategies like even in Sun and (28:36 - 28:39)
Moon there's a there's um (28:37 - 28:42)
after you beat the first totem there's a (28:39 - 28:44)
like a really rich (28:42 - 28:46)
trainer on the route I can't remember (28:44 - 28:48)
what Pokemon they have but if you don't (28:46 - 28:50)
knock out their Pokemon they just max (28:48 - 28:53)
potion it they have Max potions at that (28:50 - 28:55)
it's like a level 14 and if you get (28:53 - 28:56)
close to knocking them out they just max (28:55 - 28:58)
potion it over and over so you kind of (28:56 - 29:00)
have to get it to yellow and then knock (28:58 - 29:01)
it out because anytime you get it to Red (29:00 - 29:04)
it just max potions so there are a lot (29:01 - 29:05)
of strategies that are happening I just (29:04 - 29:08)
think lavelle's team again if if you (29:05 - 29:09)
don't have an answer for number one and (29:08 - 29:13)
number two he can actually set up (29:09 - 29:15)
properly and again just stressing if (29:13 - 29:18)
you're over leveled or if you you have a (29:15 - 29:20)
competent team and you know how to (29:18 - 29:22)
battle you're gonna get around it but (29:20 - 29:24)
structurally I think his team is really (29:22 - 29:26)
good (29:24 - 29:28)
um I mean I blew past his first two (29:26 - 29:31)
Pokemon and it was only until (29:28 - 29:34)
uh his final because I didn't know what (29:31 - 29:36)
the move was because I had never faced (29:34 - 29:38)
one and I'm like what is this doing but (29:36 - 29:42)
it once I saw it once like oh okay I (29:38 - 29:43)
just need to switch to this and then (29:42 - 29:45)
you're dead cool yeah I think (29:43 - 29:48)
especially if you're if you're not over (29:45 - 29:51)
leveled a lot of these battles it (29:48 - 29:53)
doesn't take much to completely destroy (29:51 - 29:55)
your momentum and then you know if (29:53 - 29:58)
you're if you're out speeded and you (29:55 - 30:00)
have a type disadvantage and you're not (29:58 - 30:03)
constantly switching out then you are (30:00 - 30:06)
you're going to lose you know that it (30:03 - 30:07)
doesn't take much for you to to lose (30:06 - 30:09)
that battle if you don't know exactly (30:07 - 30:11)
what you need to do (30:09 - 30:13)
speaking of being outsped I think this (30:11 - 30:17)
is why the team Star battles are harder (30:13 - 30:19)
than some of the gym leaders or some of (30:17 - 30:21)
the other battles I don't think they're (30:19 - 30:22)
the most difficult thing in the world (30:21 - 30:24)
but I think (30:22 - 30:25)
um (30:24 - 30:29)
fighting five cars and the cars almost (30:25 - 30:34)
always going first no matter what really (30:29 - 30:36)
sets (30:34 - 30:40)
that apart and it gave me big Clara (30:36 - 30:43)
oh what's the other dude's name (30:40 - 30:45)
uh the two people from the Isle of armor (30:43 - 30:49)
are uh not our Avery Avery it gave me (30:45 - 30:51)
big Clara and Avery Vibes because the (30:49 - 30:52)
interesting thing about the Clara and (30:51 - 30:54)
Avery fights is they like quote unquote (30:52 - 30:57)
cheat I think Clara even states that she (30:54 - 31:00)
cheats I just played that she's like I'm (30:57 - 31:02)
cheating yeah cool and the the (31:00 - 31:04)
interesting thing about those fights is (31:02 - 31:08)
that they do they put something (31:04 - 31:08)
uh extra in the match that you're not (31:08 - 31:14)
used to and the cars do this the cars (31:11 - 31:16)
are almost like like Mel's card has (31:14 - 31:19)
speed boost but (31:16 - 31:20)
um (31:19 - 31:22)
and I just thought like oh Colorado (31:20 - 31:24)
strategy is really good she like delays (31:22 - 31:26)
speed boost delays and now she's going (31:24 - 31:27)
first and the longer you let that match (31:26 - 31:29)
happen (31:27 - 31:29)
um (31:29 - 31:32)
the harder it is for you and but but (31:29 - 31:34)
correct me if I'm wrong the cars can't (31:32 - 31:37)
be statused right yeah yeah you cannot (31:34 - 31:39)
put the car to sleep you cannot paralyze (31:37 - 31:41)
the car yeah you can't poison the car so (31:39 - 31:45)
now be status but there there's a very (31:41 - 31:48)
few situations that you are going to go (31:45 - 31:52)
first like when I fought Gaia Como like (31:48 - 31:55)
I I was I was over leveled he was the (31:52 - 31:56)
one of the very few fights I was really (31:55 - 31:58)
over level just because I didn't know (31:56 - 31:59)
where he was (31:58 - 32:02)
um and that was fine but I was like oh (31:59 - 32:04)
geez like your car is still going first (32:02 - 32:07)
and I think that's an important thing uh (32:04 - 32:09)
again I'll bring up the blame situation (32:07 - 32:11)
when you get to Cinnabar Island you go (32:09 - 32:13)
inside Blaine has three four five (32:11 - 32:15)
whatever fire Pokemon and you surf and (32:13 - 32:17)
you surf and you surf and you just knock (32:15 - 32:20)
them all out and even if (32:17 - 32:24)
um you don't knock it out you know (32:20 - 32:26)
you resist that right you resist the (32:24 - 32:28)
fire type move he's giving you but in (32:26 - 32:31)
this situation (32:28 - 32:31)
they're they're you they're they're the (32:32 - 32:36)
ones always going first and they're (32:34 - 32:38)
hitting you pretty hard and you you (32:36 - 32:41)
don't have that I can't I can't sleep it (32:38 - 32:45)
I can't paralyze it and I think that is (32:41 - 32:46)
kind of (32:45 - 32:47)
I don't know if that's what I think (32:46 - 32:49)
should go forward but I think that is (32:47 - 32:52)
more interesting than giving a gym (32:49 - 32:57)
leader an extra Pokemon or making the (32:52 - 33:00)
gym leader match your levels or making (32:57 - 33:02)
the gym leader A Little Bit Stronger you (33:00 - 33:04)
can always out level you can always (33:02 - 33:07)
grind more to be stronger right like if (33:04 - 33:10)
the gym leader is 40 you just go to 42 (33:07 - 33:15)
or 43 right but I think the like the car (33:10 - 33:17)
always kind of going first and not being (33:15 - 33:19)
able to have a status condition I think (33:17 - 33:20)
that's just so interesting and I think (33:19 - 33:22)
that made those matches more fun and (33:20 - 33:25)
more memorable in a way of like why was (33:22 - 33:28)
it difficult like oh because the car (33:25 - 33:30)
doesn't a hundred percent act like a (33:28 - 33:33)
Pokemon those are my thoughts on it uh I (33:30 - 33:34)
mean (33:33 - 33:37)
my I I think it's interesting but it's (33:34 - 33:39)
also why is it more difficult well (33:37 - 33:41)
because they've handicapped you they've (33:39 - 33:43)
taken away one of your tools which is (33:41 - 33:47)
status effects so (33:43 - 33:50)
I mean they could handicap you in a lot (33:47 - 33:51)
of other ways too right like I don't (33:50 - 33:55)
know that that's necessarily (33:51 - 33:55)
like the big like it makes them (33:55 - 33:59)
memorable but it also they made it (33:57 - 34:02)
difficult by literally giving you a (33:59 - 34:05)
handicap which okay I mean that is a way (34:02 - 34:06)
to solve for it I don't know I think it (34:05 - 34:08)
works because there's because it's not (34:06 - 34:09)
like all eight gems right I think it (34:08 - 34:12)
works because it it's I mean I think it (34:09 - 34:14)
it separates it from the gym leaders I (34:12 - 34:17)
think it fits them thematically (34:14 - 34:21)
and I think it I think it (34:17 - 34:25)
it works but also like part of me is (34:21 - 34:26)
like (34:25 - 34:29)
okay but yeah you you you you took a set (34:26 - 34:32)
of tools away from me to make it harder (34:29 - 34:33)
and if you take your set of tools away (34:32 - 34:36)
from anybody doing a task like you can (34:33 - 34:39)
you can make a poster you just can't use (34:36 - 34:41)
paint (34:39 - 34:43)
oh well this task has now come more (34:41 - 34:45)
difficult yeah because you're denying me (34:43 - 34:46)
paint (34:45 - 34:49)
I can still do it but is that more fun (34:46 - 34:52)
and I think your mileage will vary if (34:49 - 34:54)
that's more fun well I had a good time (34:52 - 34:56)
with it but I I do think there are going (34:54 - 34:57)
to be people out there who are like well (34:56 - 35:00)
you made it harder by handicapping what (34:57 - 35:03)
I can do they they do this in alola too (35:00 - 35:05)
they they give you 2V1 (35:03 - 35:07)
um which is you know some well you know (35:05 - 35:10)
some people it's it's funny how uh you (35:07 - 35:11)
know for years people are like I'm so (35:10 - 35:12)
sick of the gym leader stuff and then (35:11 - 35:14)
they go to alola and people are like I (35:12 - 35:16)
want the gym stuff back so I think this (35:14 - 35:18)
is an amazing compromise right they give (35:16 - 35:20)
you the eight traditional gym leaders (35:18 - 35:22)
and then they give you five team star (35:20 - 35:24)
and then they give you five (35:22 - 35:27)
um Titans and I think they made them all (35:24 - 35:29)
pretty unique (35:27 - 35:33)
um which I I think is fantastic uh so (35:29 - 35:34)
instead of just (35:33 - 35:37)
do you guys remember when we reported on (35:34 - 35:39)
well we reported on the very quickly (35:37 - 35:41)
reported on because it was the same (35:39 - 35:43)
episode that there was a rumor that (35:41 - 35:45)
sword and shield was gonna have 18 gems (35:43 - 35:47)
and then that's exactly what I was just (35:45 - 35:49)
thinking I was 16 gems but yeah 16 gems (35:47 - 35:52)
yes and my first thought was I'm pretty (35:49 - 35:54)
tired of the game once I get to gym (35:52 - 35:55)
eight and that's my personal thought (35:54 - 35:57)
like I'm like usually after eight gems (35:55 - 35:59)
I'm like let's hit the Elite Four let's (35:57 - 36:01)
get credits I'm ready for post game and (35:59 - 36:04)
when I read 16 gems I was like oh why (36:01 - 36:06)
that doesn't like the pacing of that (36:04 - 36:09)
sounds bad like I'm already exhausted by (36:06 - 36:11)
eight obviously that that rumor only (36:09 - 36:13)
lasted about an hour before it was like (36:11 - 36:14)
disproven (36:13 - 36:15)
um (36:14 - 36:19)
and so this (36:15 - 36:22)
I think was great like whether or not (36:19 - 36:25)
you think team star is hard or easy I (36:22 - 36:27)
think the how they differentiate (36:25 - 36:31)
differentiated it was close enough close (36:27 - 36:34)
enough uh I and this and the Titan stuff (36:31 - 36:37)
I think really made it feel (36:34 - 36:39)
refreshing instead of like well you got (36:37 - 36:42)
10 more Gym Battles I hope you liked the (36:39 - 36:45)
other ones (36:42 - 36:45)
yeah I think that is you know I was (36:45 - 36:50)
before you mentioned that I was actually (36:47 - 36:52)
thinking hey we finally got the the 16 (36:50 - 36:54)
well 18 in this case Gym Battles I think (36:52 - 36:56)
that is a better way to do it though if (36:54 - 36:58)
you want more make them different (36:56 - 37:00)
um because I think if you if you just (36:58 - 37:01)
want (37:00 - 37:03)
I just want to become the champion you (37:01 - 37:05)
can just do that and you can ignore the (37:03 - 37:06)
other stuff you're not going to let's be (37:05 - 37:07)
honest but you could if you really (37:06 - 37:09)
wanted to I don't think anyone's (37:07 - 37:10)
actually going to just play through one (37:09 - 37:12)
of the three stories and then not do the (37:10 - 37:13)
others (37:12 - 37:15)
um I I will say there is one one problem (37:13 - 37:18)
with all these these things (37:15 - 37:21)
um the team star stuff the Titan stuff (37:18 - 37:23)
and as you say in the previous games (37:21 - 37:27)
um with the with sun and moon the um (37:23 - 37:29)
totem why can I never remember words the (37:27 - 37:31)
totem Pokemon I think the the problem (37:29 - 37:33)
with them is that they only really work (37:31 - 37:35)
the first time (37:33 - 37:38)
and then it's they work because of the (37:35 - 37:39)
surprise (37:38 - 37:41)
um and that does make them interesting (37:39 - 37:43)
and memorable the first time you do them (37:41 - 37:45)
but it doesn't necessarily make replays (37:43 - 37:47)
interesting it's almost like I said this (37:45 - 37:50)
about the map and how they should (37:47 - 37:52)
surprise you and it works for it yeah (37:50 - 37:55)
the same thing Steve it's not the same (37:52 - 37:57)
thing but the one thing I did think that (37:55 - 37:59)
should have been different is I thought (37:57 - 38:01)
that (37:59 - 38:04)
going into each Camp would be a slightly (38:01 - 38:05)
different (38:04 - 38:08)
test you had to solve not everyone was (38:05 - 38:10)
going to be just knock out 30 Pokemon in (38:08 - 38:12)
10 minutes using this or at least be (38:10 - 38:15)
more difficult because because that was (38:12 - 38:16)
not difficult I think it was an (38:15 - 38:18)
interesting way and and clearly it was (38:16 - 38:20)
it only existed to get you to use the (38:18 - 38:22)
let's go feature because you don't have (38:20 - 38:23)
to use it in any other part of the game (38:22 - 38:25)
and it teaches you that but it wasn't I (38:23 - 38:27)
got most of them done in like two (38:25 - 38:30)
minutes okay so the the let that that (38:27 - 38:33)
feature exists for a specific reason uh (38:30 - 38:37)
it's just and and the the two reasons (38:33 - 38:39)
actually number one is to teach you type (38:37 - 38:41)
weakness (38:39 - 38:43)
which (38:41 - 38:45)
I don't care what like the people (38:43 - 38:47)
listening to the show most of them will (38:45 - 38:51)
be like what that's dumb there are so (38:47 - 38:54)
many like like just have you ever done (38:51 - 38:58)
uh uh a random raid with people after (38:54 - 39:01)
post game and they just bring in Corydon (38:58 - 39:03)
or me ride on and they don't look at (39:01 - 39:05)
type weakness that it's just (39:03 - 39:10)
people don't get it if if so in my (39:05 - 39:13)
preview in New York (39:10 - 39:15)
uh this is the it's hard for me to um (39:13 - 39:18)
give my exact personal playthrough (39:15 - 39:19)
because again I went through with all (39:18 - 39:21)
water Pokemon (39:19 - 39:24)
um and I don't think any of the team (39:21 - 39:25)
Star had (39:24 - 39:28)
anything resisting water yeah they don't (39:25 - 39:29)
um (39:28 - 39:33)
so when I brought my sit Titan (39:29 - 39:35)
I led to Titan because I forgot that the (39:33 - 39:37)
Titan was ice because I'm dumb uh and (39:35 - 39:39)
then I brought like two other Pokemon (39:37 - 39:43)
and in that team Star Battle my like the (39:39 - 39:45)
let's go thing mice the Titan died (39:43 - 39:47)
instantly (39:45 - 39:50)
so what they are doing is they are (39:47 - 39:52)
checking to see if you have three (39:50 - 39:56)
Pokemon that could actually do the fight (39:52 - 39:58)
so even though like you can go in and be (39:56 - 40:00)
like oh it was really easy because it's (39:58 - 40:02)
dark so I brought in I brought in two (40:00 - 40:03)
fighting Pokemon and a water Pokemon and (40:02 - 40:05)
I blazed through it that's what they (40:03 - 40:07)
they're they're literally level checking (40:05 - 40:10)
you at that point if you went in to the (40:07 - 40:13)
dark and you you put three psychic you (40:10 - 40:16)
would fail you would you would fail it (40:13 - 40:18)
like I think that's fair but also what's (40:16 - 40:21)
the I'm not sure that's done hugely well (40:18 - 40:22)
because what's the there's no feedback (40:21 - 40:25)
as to the reasoning there (40:22 - 40:27)
like I think you get that if you if you (40:25 - 40:30)
lose to the the leader you get I think (40:27 - 40:32)
you get like uh oh these are good types (40:30 - 40:34)
I think if I'm remembering correctly it (40:32 - 40:36)
goes oh these would be good types to go (40:34 - 40:38)
with but I don't think you get that if (40:36 - 40:40)
you lose well actually I guess I didn't (40:38 - 40:42)
do it maybe it does say that I I don't (40:40 - 40:43)
know because I've just I've just said (40:42 - 40:45)
that I didn't lose to them I get the (40:43 - 40:47)
level check part of it and that's fine (40:45 - 40:49)
and I I think it works the first time (40:47 - 40:51)
it's just by the fifth time of having to (40:49 - 40:53)
use that feature I was like I would (40:51 - 40:55)
really like (40:53 - 40:59)
the the front part to feel as unique as (40:55 - 41:02)
the boss I'm about to face and yeah I've (40:59 - 41:04)
always it's always the same let's go (41:02 - 41:06)
feature where I'm just walking around (41:04 - 41:10)
sending them out I I thought I thought (41:06 - 41:12)
there should have been or could have (41:10 - 41:16)
been some other aspect to make each base (41:12 - 41:18)
feel a bit more unique Because by the (41:16 - 41:20)
time by the second time I did that I'm (41:18 - 41:22)
like I'm already over this the third (41:20 - 41:24)
time I'm like just come on I don't even (41:22 - 41:25)
care I'm not even gonna try even just (41:24 - 41:27)
having go even just having more variety (41:25 - 41:29)
of Pokemon because I found that they (41:27 - 41:31)
were like four different Pokemon in each (41:29 - 41:33)
of them and they just kept on sending (41:31 - 41:35)
out the same four Pokemon yeah I I think (41:33 - 41:36)
a thing that we haven't even talked (41:35 - 41:39)
about is you know most Pokemon games (41:36 - 41:41)
people go through with maybe six or (41:39 - 41:43)
eight different Pokemon right when you (41:41 - 41:44)
when you get to like the seventh or (41:43 - 41:46)
eight gym the likelihood that you're (41:44 - 41:48)
gonna remove one of your six members for (41:46 - 41:51)
a new member is pretty low (41:48 - 41:52)
um there might be a Pokemon that you (41:51 - 41:54)
absolutely fall in love with at like gym (41:52 - 41:56)
seven and you're like I ABS I want you (41:54 - 41:57)
on my team I'm kicking off I don't know (41:56 - 42:00)
like wulu or something and now I'm gonna (41:57 - 42:01)
like spend some time to level you up so (42:00 - 42:03)
you like that's the other part right (42:01 - 42:05)
like even if you found a Pokemon that (42:03 - 42:06)
you're in love with by the time you get (42:05 - 42:08)
to the seventh gym it might not even be (42:06 - 42:10)
the correct level as everyone else (42:08 - 42:12)
and I think one of the unspoken things (42:10 - 42:15)
about this game is is because there are (42:12 - 42:18)
eight like I I actually find it weird if (42:15 - 42:21)
somebody went through all 18 badges with (42:18 - 42:23)
the same six Pokemon like in a game with (42:21 - 42:27)
400 Pokemon and twice as many badges I (42:23 - 42:28)
kind of think it's weird that you're (42:27 - 42:30)
just like I'm just gonna use six I I (42:28 - 42:32)
think it's weird like there's so many (42:30 - 42:34)
Pokemon to choose from there's so many (42:32 - 42:36)
new ones there's so many returning ones (42:34 - 42:38)
there's new moves there's new abilities (42:36 - 42:42)
like you didn't feel compelled to switch (42:38 - 42:43)
out stuff (42:42 - 42:46)
no no (42:43 - 42:48)
like like that's just shocking to me (42:46 - 42:50)
like (42:48 - 42:52)
all what I play through I I went through (42:50 - 42:55)
like 10 to 12 pounds or six that I liked (42:52 - 42:57)
a lot and I kept them (42:55 - 43:00)
these are my yeah this is my team this (42:57 - 43:02)
is we're we're rolling paldea together (43:00 - 43:04)
but even in like the anime Ash has like (43:02 - 43:07)
12 Pokemon and he'll he'll call certain (43:04 - 43:09)
Pokemon when he I have a half 15. I (43:07 - 43:11)
didn't need to ever call him they (43:09 - 43:13)
they're good I called them out for like (43:11 - 43:16)
I called up my toad it's good or (43:13 - 43:18)
whatever his name is to go so it's cool (43:16 - 43:21)
so it's cool to go paralyze things when (43:18 - 43:22)
I was catching them but other than get (43:21 - 43:25)
back in the Box because my team and I (43:22 - 43:27)
are gonna go take on this gym we are (43:25 - 43:30)
here my eyes my eyes are on the final my (43:27 - 43:31)
eyes are on the final battle right so (43:30 - 43:34)
I'm I'm creating a team that has good (43:31 - 43:35)
overall (43:34 - 43:38)
type strengths and defenses right like (43:35 - 43:41)
I'm I'm not really thinking about things (43:38 - 43:42)
like I will look at one and go oh that's (43:41 - 43:44)
cool will it work for me and there's a (43:42 - 43:45)
couple of times that I'll switch Pokemon (43:44 - 43:47)
out (43:45 - 43:49)
but yeah like I'm certainly not con I (43:47 - 43:52)
maybe used eight Pokemon in my first (43:49 - 43:54)
playthrough like even against guy Como (43:52 - 43:56)
when I realized I was (43:54 - 43:58)
um over leveled and I could tell that (43:56 - 44:00)
because of the Pokemon in the area I was (43:58 - 44:02)
like oh the Pokemon in the area are only (44:00 - 44:03)
like I think guy combo is like what he's (44:02 - 44:06)
like 18 19 I think yeah he's like 20. (44:03 - 44:09)
um I was like oh like I'm I'm like 25 (44:06 - 44:12)
26. so like I was like I'm gonna bring (44:09 - 44:14)
my three weakest water Pokemon because (44:12 - 44:16)
like they don't really see it because I (44:14 - 44:18)
was limiting myself to like if a gym (44:16 - 44:19)
leader had three I brought three because (44:18 - 44:22)
that was a fun way for me to do it I (44:19 - 44:23)
don't suggest that everyone should do it (44:22 - 44:26)
that way but uh I was like oh I'll just (44:23 - 44:27)
bring like the three that don't really (44:26 - 44:28)
see a lot of play because I'm like (44:27 - 44:30)
slightly over leveled and I usually box (44:28 - 44:32)
these three for the gym (44:30 - 44:33)
um or whatever (44:32 - 44:37)
so yeah I mean like (44:33 - 44:39)
I don't know it's just it's just funny (44:37 - 44:41)
how like (44:39 - 44:43)
I mean I'm I'm sure the same the the the (44:41 - 44:47)
same thing is you know in a game like (44:43 - 44:49)
Elden ring where you have so many spells (44:47 - 44:50)
so many summons so many different (44:49 - 44:51)
weapons and I'm sure there are people (44:50 - 44:53)
that are just like I'm just gonna use (44:51 - 44:54)
this sword the entire time and it's like (44:53 - 44:56)
well you have so many different options (44:54 - 44:58)
that you can use (44:56 - 44:59)
um (44:58 - 45:02)
what but I'm good with this one yeah I (44:59 - 45:05)
mean like I don't know (45:02 - 45:05)
Elder ring has like a situation where (45:05 - 45:10)
like certain bosses are are resistant to (45:07 - 45:12)
Magic so if I'm running an all-magic (45:10 - 45:13)
build (45:12 - 45:16)
I I this Dragon doesn't take magic (45:13 - 45:18)
damage so I have to switch to a sword (45:16 - 45:21)
and I have no strength or dexterity and (45:18 - 45:24)
sword use so like do I do I try to brute (45:21 - 45:25)
force it with magic which is doing (45:24 - 45:26)
little to no damage because that's my (45:25 - 45:28)
high stat or do I try to switch to a (45:26 - 45:30)
sword and learn this sword even though (45:28 - 45:32)
it does more damage even though my stats (45:30 - 45:34)
aren't in that well um and I think (45:32 - 45:36)
Pokemon tries to do that right like or (45:34 - 45:38)
at least this game is trying to do it of (45:36 - 45:40)
like giving you so many different fights (45:38 - 45:41)
of like (45:40 - 45:43)
you know if (45:41 - 45:46)
one of these team star people were (45:43 - 45:49)
electric I (45:46 - 45:51)
me personally I don't know how I get (45:49 - 45:53)
around that right like (45:51 - 45:54)
um it I think a lot of people didn't (45:53 - 45:57)
struggle away I use gastrodon like it's (45:54 - 45:59)
one of your favorites right right well I (45:57 - 46:01)
didn't like when I fought the Electric (45:59 - 46:03)
Gym I didn't have gastrodon at that (46:01 - 46:05)
point so like that was you know I could (46:03 - 46:08)
have I could have right I could have I (46:05 - 46:10)
didn't have one yeah I mean you did not (46:08 - 46:13)
seek out your ride or die Team like some (46:10 - 46:17)
of us did I mean that like I had I mean (46:13 - 46:20)
I will say that there was one time when (46:17 - 46:22)
I found uh (46:20 - 46:25)
tinkerton or Tinker Tink that is like I (46:22 - 46:30)
I am now making a swap I am I am booting (46:25 - 46:32)
fairy dog (46:30 - 46:34)
for this incredible (46:32 - 46:37)
top tier Pokemon sure that was probably (46:34 - 46:39)
one of the only changes even when I (46:37 - 46:41)
found ice Godzilla I'm like ice Godzilla (46:39 - 46:45)
I love you you are my sweet child and I (46:41 - 46:49)
will cherish you forever post game (46:45 - 46:49)
yeah I think it depends on what you're (46:52 - 46:56)
looking for right like for me Pokemon (46:53 - 46:58)
isn't about the battles right like I'll (46:56 - 47:01)
do the I'll do the battles and some of (46:58 - 47:03)
them might vaguely interest me but my (47:01 - 47:05)
what I like about Pokemon is the (47:03 - 47:08)
collection and so I I do my second (47:05 - 47:09)
playthrough which is where I basically (47:08 - 47:11)
collect and evolve everything as early (47:09 - 47:12)
as possible (47:11 - 47:14)
and that's and that's I guess my (47:12 - 47:16)
equivalent was you you would much more (47:14 - 47:19)
enjoy going through a story with a (47:16 - 47:21)
variety of those Pokemon rather than (47:19 - 47:23)
kind of just catching them and and (47:21 - 47:25)
boxing them essentially like those yeah (47:23 - 47:28)
there's just so many new Pokemon here (47:25 - 47:31)
and there's so many opportunities to try (47:28 - 47:32)
them in battle (47:31 - 47:35)
uh and if you're in a situation where (47:32 - 47:38)
you're over leveled like let's say (47:35 - 47:40)
um you did all the gyms except you (47:38 - 47:41)
missed the psychic gym (47:40 - 47:44)
let's not talk about gyms let's say you (47:41 - 47:45)
did all the team star people and all the (47:44 - 47:47)
gyms and you missed Atticus and you know (47:45 - 47:51)
Atticus is what like 35-ish 36 I think (47:47 - 47:54)
uh is that the poison one the poison one (47:51 - 47:56)
yeah yeah and you're like well my whole (47:54 - 47:58)
team's 50 and he's 36 like (47:56 - 48:02)
I caught uh Claude Claude sire and I (47:58 - 48:04)
caught all these other Pokemon like why (48:02 - 48:06)
don't I try these Pokemon for this fight (48:04 - 48:10)
or or yeah why don't I just steamroll it (48:06 - 48:12)
because yeah you could I don't care my (48:10 - 48:15)
team and I are we're on a journey it's (48:12 - 48:19)
me and my six Buds nobody else sure we (48:15 - 48:22)
have Set uh close the doors these are my (48:19 - 48:25)
six friends I don't trust any of you get (48:22 - 48:27)
in the Box (48:25 - 48:27)
my life who just do their starter right (48:27 - 48:32)
my starter would just be my entire (48:30 - 48:34)
Journey no I'm saying there are some (48:32 - 48:36)
people who just only use their starter (48:34 - 48:38)
they don't care about anyone else that (48:36 - 48:41)
is (48:38 - 48:41)
there was a survey in Japan leading up (48:41 - 48:45)
to sword and shield it was a it was the (48:44 - 48:47)
secret Club the secret you had to like (48:45 - 48:49)
pay like eight dollars to get into the (48:47 - 48:50)
Pokemon wrap this thing up we've been (48:49 - 48:54)
going on for way too long and um (48:50 - 48:56)
uh we could just break these into two (48:54 - 48:57)
episodes actually (48:56 - 48:58)
we're gonna have to because this is (48:57 - 49:01)
almost an hour uh so there was the the (48:58 - 49:04)
Pokemon secret Club (49:01 - 49:06)
and you paid eight dollars and then they (49:04 - 49:07)
would that you would get stuff but (49:06 - 49:09)
anyways there was a there was a quiz or (49:07 - 49:11)
not a quiz but like a poll and one of (49:09 - 49:14)
the polls was uh do you prefer to use (49:11 - 49:17)
one Pokemon or do you prefer to use a (49:14 - 49:19)
full team and (49:17 - 49:23)
45 of people in this poll said they (49:19 - 49:26)
would prefer to use one Pokemon (49:23 - 49:30)
um which is I mean it's just shocking I (49:26 - 49:32)
obviously Japanese audience specifically (49:30 - 49:34)
because that's what the secret Club was (49:32 - 49:36)
but that's still a lot of people that (49:34 - 49:37)
are like yeah I'll just use one Pokemon (49:36 - 49:39)
it's fine I'll just just I'll just use (49:37 - 49:42)
my starter it's it's fine (49:39 - 49:43)
um like there's different ways to play (49:42 - 49:45)
Pokemon for sure and I think even though (49:43 - 49:47)
like Greg said earlier is handicapped (49:45 - 49:49)
the right word or is are we are we (49:47 - 49:50)
allowed to is there a bad word a (49:49 - 49:54)
handicap is is a term for multiple it is (49:50 - 49:56)
not when you're talking about (49:54 - 49:59)
a person who is disabled or differently (49:56 - 50:03)
abled but handicap exists outside of (49:59 - 50:05)
that and look like outside of that is (50:03 - 50:08)
okay uh (50:05 - 50:13)
I I like the handicap they give (50:08 - 50:15)
because I do think it forces you to play (50:13 - 50:18)
the game differently (50:15 - 50:22)
and I think sometimes people need that (50:18 - 50:24)
push (50:22 - 50:28)
um and uh like in my situation right I (50:24 - 50:31)
went like the the thing I hear is I wish (50:28 - 50:34)
if I wish the gym leaders would uh (50:31 - 50:37)
like I wish you didn't have to I wish I (50:34 - 50:39)
like the gym leaders would block it so I (50:37 - 50:40)
can't use items (50:39 - 50:41)
well (50:40 - 50:43)
no one is telling you you need to use a (50:41 - 50:47)
potion or a revive like you can choose (50:43 - 50:50)
to not do that yourself (50:47 - 50:53)
um but I sometimes I I think that people (50:50 - 50:57)
need that quote-unquote handicap to then (50:53 - 51:00)
think or play differently like if your (50:57 - 51:01)
strategy is always to paralyze (51:00 - 51:02)
everything which is very a viable (51:01 - 51:04)
strategy like like hey you cannot speed (51:02 - 51:07)
the car cool I'll paralyze it guess what (51:04 - 51:09)
you can't you you then have to kind of (51:07 - 51:11)
rethink your team differently (51:09 - 51:13)
um or at least your strategy differently (51:11 - 51:14)
like I always do this I always do that (51:13 - 51:18)
and I I think that I would like to see (51:14 - 51:21)
more of that instead of (51:18 - 51:22)
um (51:21 - 51:24)
because I do think we're at a point (51:22 - 51:27)
where (51:24 - 51:29)
again I don't need it to be harder (51:27 - 51:32)
but but I think those battles become (51:29 - 51:34)
more memorable (51:32 - 51:37)
can be more memorable or can force (51:34 - 51:40)
somebody to then re-evaluate how to play (51:37 - 51:42)
instead of just going in and hitting the (51:40 - 51:44)
super effective yeah just like my (51:42 - 51:45)
example in Eldon ring (51:44 - 51:47)
I've been using magic for the last 30 (51:45 - 51:50)
hours I want to beat this dragon (51:47 - 51:53)
I can't use magic so I have to do (51:50 - 51:54)
something else (51:53 - 51:57)
or I could just ignore the dragon I (51:54 - 51:58)
could just go I don't have to beat the (51:57 - 52:00)
dragon I could just go around it uh it (51:58 - 52:03)
you know it is it is a (52:00 - 52:06)
far far (52:03 - 52:08)
I mean the hope is that it that it makes (52:06 - 52:10)
more people excited than it makes people (52:08 - 52:13)
frustrated yeah and whenever you do that (52:10 - 52:17)
you you run the risk of frustrating (52:13 - 52:19)
a large part of your audience and (52:17 - 52:22)
whether or not that happens I yeah I (52:19 - 52:24)
don't know like there are bigger issues (52:22 - 52:27)
in this game to talk about than whether (52:24 - 52:29)
or not you couldn't paralyze the car (52:27 - 52:31)
right there are way worse things that (52:29 - 52:32)
have been happening at this game than (52:31 - 52:33)
that so I don't know that we'll ever get (52:32 - 52:35)
a definitive answer I think if the game (52:33 - 52:38)
ran perfectly we could hear more of (52:35 - 52:41)
people who (52:38 - 52:43)
really liked that having to think (52:41 - 52:45)
strategy versus people who found it (52:43 - 52:49)
absolutely frustrating and that's forced (52:45 - 52:51)
them to stop playing the game because (52:49 - 52:54)
that is a risk that you're right or like (52:51 - 52:55)
I'm just never gonna do that plot line (52:54 - 52:57)
because I don't I don't ever want to (52:55 - 52:59)
play in the game that way (52:57 - 53:03)
um I mean hard to say I I think for long (52:59 - 53:07)
time people like us and uh people (53:03 - 53:08)
listening to the podcast who have been (53:07 - 53:10)
listening to the podcast for years it (53:08 - 53:13)
was a fun and exciting challenge I don't (53:10 - 53:15)
know that that translates to people who (53:13 - 53:18)
this is their second Pokemon game this (53:15 - 53:21)
is their first Pokemon game I I I can't (53:18 - 53:23)
say that universally this is a beloved (53:21 - 53:26)
choice but I think for us on the podcast (53:23 - 53:30)
and long time fans I think it was the (53:26 - 53:31)
first time (53:30 - 53:34)
oh this is really interesting yes from (53:31 - 53:36)
then on it was boring to me I'm like (53:34 - 53:37)
okay I just know I can't do these things (53:36 - 53:39)
and I know they're gonna have some (53:37 - 53:40)
gimmick so I just need to plan (53:39 - 53:43)
accordingly and put these things out and (53:40 - 53:44)
I'm gonna switch my moves around maybe (53:43 - 53:47)
or not I'm just gonna go in and I know I (53:44 - 53:50)
have coverage (53:47 - 53:51)
this is actually where what I one of the (53:50 - 53:53)
things I really love about this game is (53:51 - 53:55)
that (53:53 - 53:57)
um you will have people like that who (53:55 - 54:00)
like get frustrated by that and they can (53:57 - 54:02)
like in previous games they can just put (54:00 - 54:06)
it down or if you really like collecting (54:02 - 54:09)
you can collect 380 out of the 400 (54:06 - 54:11)
Pokemon without doing any of the badges (54:09 - 54:13)
or any of the Titans (54:11 - 54:14)
um (54:13 - 54:16)
and then by the time you've done that (54:14 - 54:18)
you're going to be way over leveled you (54:16 - 54:20)
can go and trash anything you want right (54:18 - 54:22)
so it allows you I love the flexibility (54:20 - 54:24)
of that the ability that you can go oh I (54:22 - 54:26)
don't care about the battles I'll go and (54:24 - 54:29)
spend 20 hours collecting and then just (54:26 - 54:32)
just Spam through that rest of the bit (54:29 - 54:33)
to get to the final the final bit of the (54:32 - 54:34)
game to catch the rest of the Pokemon (54:33 - 54:37)
whereas you couldn't do that in previous (54:34 - 54:40)
games there was no ability to do that (54:37 - 54:42)
yeah I think uh so it's like three three (54:40 - 54:44)
things on my part and then we could talk (54:42 - 54:46)
about Penny and then we can wrap up (54:44 - 54:46)
um (54:46 - 54:49)
one is I think if if you do struggle I (54:46 - 54:51)
think this is why the level like not (54:49 - 54:53)
having scaling levels or a level cap is (54:51 - 54:55)
kind of a good thing because (54:53 - 54:57)
the game is offering you a traditional (54:55 - 54:58)
Pokemon experience (54:57 - 55:01)
through the eight gems and I think like (54:58 - 55:03)
if this is your first Pokemon game you (55:01 - 55:04)
might struggle with it but like that's (55:03 - 55:06)
the traditional experience get the HMS (55:04 - 55:08)
and then (55:06 - 55:11)
the the Titan is like again even if (55:08 - 55:13)
you're struggling or you don't (55:11 - 55:14)
understand you have Arvin there to help (55:13 - 55:16)
you and then this would be the harder (55:14 - 55:17)
thing I don't think anyone's gonna (55:16 - 55:20)
debate that team star isn't the hardest (55:17 - 55:22)
there will people there will be people (55:20 - 55:24)
that will say like I didn't struggle (55:22 - 55:25)
with it (55:24 - 55:26)
great that's not the point we're making (55:25 - 55:28)
the point we're making is out of the (55:26 - 55:31)
three paths team star is the harder of (55:28 - 55:33)
the three (55:31 - 55:35)
um so it it has a (55:33 - 55:38)
it has a higher difficulty level because (55:35 - 55:40)
of the things they force you to do (55:38 - 55:43)
because yeah because of the the car (55:40 - 55:47)
um and so like you if players were (55:43 - 55:49)
struggling with this they can over level (55:47 - 55:52)
they can come back right (55:49 - 55:55)
um so I I think that that that (55:52 - 55:58)
that (55:55 - 56:01)
is a solvable issue I think for long (55:58 - 56:04)
time players they see something that (56:01 - 56:06)
might force them to be different so I do (56:04 - 56:08)
see it as like a win-win right like a (56:06 - 56:10)
win-win for long-term players to be like (56:08 - 56:12)
Oh I'm forced out of my comfort zone uh (56:10 - 56:14)
and then for returning for new players (56:12 - 56:16)
like oh this is a little more difficult (56:14 - 56:19)
me but the answer is just like come back (56:16 - 56:22)
or over level and then I think of like (56:19 - 56:26)
future battles in like a gen 10 or in uh (56:22 - 56:27)
whatever (56:26 - 56:32)
black black white three right yeah not (56:27 - 56:33)
necessarily Gym Battles but if they do (56:32 - 56:36)
the you know 18 badges again it'd be (56:33 - 56:37)
cool if you fought somebody where it was (56:36 - 56:40)
like constant Sun like no matter what (56:37 - 56:42)
you did the sun was always out so if you (56:40 - 56:44)
were fighting like a fire type gym (56:42 - 56:46)
leader cool water type moves are reduced (56:44 - 56:48)
because the sun is out I can't it's (56:46 - 56:51)
gonna be quote unquote harder or a water (56:48 - 56:53)
type person where a constant rain is out (56:51 - 56:56)
although that benefits the Thunder yeah (56:53 - 56:59)
but you know what I'm saying like there (56:56 - 57:00)
are different mechanics that you could (56:59 - 57:03)
just put that I think that I'm glad I (57:00 - 57:06)
saw here because and we saw that we saw (57:03 - 57:07)
that earlier we saw that in Isle of (57:06 - 57:09)
armor yep Crown Tundra where they they (57:07 - 57:11)
put effects in and I was like oh these (57:09 - 57:13)
are really interesting for (57:11 - 57:15)
us four people who have played a lot of (57:13 - 57:17)
Pokemon games (57:15 - 57:21)
um I will say I forgot that Clara (57:17 - 57:21)
did that and since I was playing with my (57:21 - 57:27)
All-Star favorites she I went in and I (57:24 - 57:29)
was like oh Rosary go and Rosary ate up (57:27 - 57:32)
all the toxic spikes I'm like (57:29 - 57:35)
that was nothing thanks yeah yeah I mean (57:32 - 57:37)
there's there's always there's always an (57:35 - 57:39)
answer to something like like uh (57:37 - 57:42)
somebody commented on the YouTube that (57:39 - 57:43)
like (57:42 - 57:45)
it would be impossible to beat like a (57:43 - 57:47)
gym leader with like a level five (57:45 - 57:48)
Pokemon or so I think Alan and I had (57:47 - 57:52)
this conversation uh last time where I (57:48 - 57:55)
was like oh I I could beat Mela with (57:52 - 57:57)
like a level five Pokemon I think mela's (57:55 - 57:59)
about like level 28 level 29. (57:57 - 58:02)
so you you can you can evolve Char Cadet (57:59 - 58:05)
into cereal Edge at any level you just (58:02 - 58:08)
need the malicious armor or whatever is (58:05 - 58:09)
that I think it is that called malicious (58:08 - 58:12)
armor yeah it's malicious armor so uh so (58:09 - 58:14)
real Edge is fire ghost (58:12 - 58:16)
and it has the ability (58:14 - 58:20)
uh what fire flash fire flash fire so (58:16 - 58:22)
the car (58:20 - 58:24)
let me tell you the cars moves overheat (58:22 - 58:26)
blazing torque Screech Swift (58:24 - 58:28)
can't overheat you (58:26 - 58:31)
can't blazing torque you it can Screech (58:28 - 58:32)
you all you want (58:31 - 58:34)
can't Swift you (58:32 - 58:36)
I didn't I'm not cheating (58:34 - 58:41)
I I like I it's just that this Pokemon (58:36 - 58:45)
it's 26 by the way level 26. it can (58:41 - 58:48)
literally not hit a level one armor (58:45 - 58:50)
Rouge or not armor Rouge uh ceruledge (58:48 - 58:51)
you win (58:50 - 58:53)
that's it that's what it comes down to (58:51 - 58:55)
you win (58:53 - 58:57)
uh eventually boy is that a long boring (58:55 - 58:59)
battle sure you can also go to Ganon (58:57 - 59:02)
right off the gate is it gonna be a lot (58:59 - 59:05)
harder and take forever absolutely you (59:02 - 59:07)
can do it though (59:05 - 59:08)
that that's all that was the whole point (59:07 - 59:10)
I was trying to make last week there are (59:08 - 59:12)
so many situations where if you (59:10 - 59:14)
understand abilities type weakness the (59:12 - 59:16)
move sets that they have the move sets (59:14 - 59:19)
you have you can win (59:16 - 59:22)
um is it harder if they have six Pokemon (59:19 - 59:25)
absolutely it I mean again if you if you (59:22 - 59:28)
know the exact puzzle and you have the (59:25 - 59:30)
exact puzzle pieces you can win (59:28 - 59:33)
like that is that is a given in any game (59:30 - 59:35)
if I know the puzzle and I know the (59:33 - 59:36)
exact key (59:35 - 59:39)
cool and I think in something like Eldon (59:36 - 59:42)
ring or Zelda the key is (59:39 - 59:45)
your your ability to dodge right I mean (59:42 - 59:47)
yeah the difference I think were people (59:45 - 59:51)
bristle against it is (59:47 - 59:51)
in Zelda and Elden ring there is a level (59:51 - 59:57)
of your skill that comes into play and (59:54 - 59:59)
in Pokemon there are just pieces of a (59:57 - 60:02)
puzzle you can put together to unlock (59:59 - 60:04)
the key and that's a very different (60:02 - 60:06)
experience sure (60:04 - 60:09)
a very different experience and I (60:06 - 60:12)
whether or not you find that more (60:09 - 60:14)
rewarding or not is your personal view (60:12 - 60:17)
right like there is a scale in figuring (60:14 - 60:19)
out the puzzle though yeah 100 like like (60:17 - 60:22)
when I was fighting uh claval Club (60:19 - 60:25)
that's his name right (60:22 - 60:28)
when I was fighting clavel (60:25 - 60:30)
my option was to hit a super effective (60:28 - 60:32)
move against meowskarada (60:30 - 60:35)
or icy wind which did little to no (60:32 - 60:38)
damage the answer was the icy wind (60:35 - 60:41)
because I needed that speed drop to (60:38 - 60:43)
ensure that my last two Pokemon could (60:41 - 60:47)
knock out miascarata but (60:43 - 60:48)
so many people were like oh why didn't (60:47 - 60:50)
you hit the super effective move (60:48 - 60:52)
like that that's not the win condition (60:50 - 60:54)
there there's a really funny video of (60:52 - 60:59)
Joe Serebii battling Leon with Ash's (60:54 - 61:01)
team I did the same video because I was (60:59 - 61:02)
like oh that's a fun idea that's like (61:01 - 61:04)
really neat like I should battle Leon (61:02 - 61:07)
with Ash's team and (61:04 - 61:10)
in that battle it was like Charizard vs (61:07 - 61:12)
I think Pikachu and I was like oh he (61:10 - 61:14)
needs an electroweb here because he's (61:12 - 61:16)
not gonna because Charizard's gonna out (61:14 - 61:19)
speed and if he doesn't elect her web he (61:16 - 61:21)
loses and he doesn't he he volt tackles (61:19 - 61:23)
and does like half of Charizard's health (61:21 - 61:25)
and then Charizard (61:23 - 61:26)
knocks him out (61:25 - 61:28)
and then his last Pokemon comes in it's (61:26 - 61:30)
a it's a dracovish which has obvious (61:28 - 61:33)
type weakness or type advantage and (61:30 - 61:34)
Charizard just out speeds and knocks out (61:33 - 61:37)
the dracovish and it's like well the win (61:34 - 61:39)
condition is you slow down Charizard you (61:37 - 61:40)
get the guaranteed knockout with (61:39 - 61:44)
drekovich you win but you decided to opt (61:40 - 61:47)
for the the more damage move so anyways (61:44 - 61:50)
the point is like (61:47 - 61:54)
that there is a skill in Pokemon uh but (61:50 - 61:57)
Pokemon is so informational based yeah I (61:54 - 61:59)
mean there's a there is a wealth of (61:57 - 62:02)
knowledge you have that it's very (61:59 - 62:07)
different it's a different set of (62:02 - 62:07)
skills and knowledge is a harder thing (62:08 - 62:13)
to grow (62:11 - 62:17)
um because it's it's a it's a harder (62:13 - 62:21)
memory and response uh work a lot (62:17 - 62:25)
different than muscle memory does yes so (62:21 - 62:29)
it is a very different and (62:25 - 62:29)
we aren't (62:30 - 62:37)
as a society pretty very great at memory (62:32 - 62:39)
and knowledge based anything like we (62:37 - 62:42)
don't have a lot of things to build that (62:39 - 62:44)
up like we do for muscle memory and (62:42 - 62:46)
other things we are real good at (62:44 - 62:48)
repetitive tasks to make your hands do (62:46 - 62:49)
the things without you thinking it's (62:48 - 62:52)
called typing your Pokemon muscle memory (62:49 - 62:54)
is constantly opening the Pokedex (62:52 - 62:55)
because you're trying to roll like you (62:54 - 62:59)
could in Legends oh um (62:55 - 63:03)
mine is crouching at the Pokemon oh yeah (62:59 - 63:05)
yeah yeah beat it back out of the menu (63:03 - 63:06)
okay I thought I was the only one doing (63:05 - 63:09)
that no have you not seen that comment (63:06 - 63:11)
the comic of the person I saw the little (63:09 - 63:13)
comic and uh (63:11 - 63:16)
yeah every time except if you're like me (63:13 - 63:19)
it's a (63:16 - 63:22)
30 chance that that exact move will (63:19 - 63:25)
cause your game to crash (63:22 - 63:25)
when I put the controller down for five (63:26 - 63:30)
minutes and then I pick it back up to (63:29 - 63:33)
play I don't know why but yeah if I as (63:30 - 63:36)
long as I keep moving my game never (63:33 - 63:39)
crashes but the second I stop it in five (63:36 - 63:41)
minutes the game is like ah how dare you (63:39 - 63:42)
how dare you put me down it's like how (63:41 - 63:44)
sharks die when they stop swimming yeah (63:42 - 63:47)
uh anyways uh probably wrap this up in (63:44 - 63:49)
the next five ten minutes here penny uh (63:47 - 63:51)
the penny fight I mean she has an EV (63:49 - 63:53)
backpack (63:51 - 63:56)
R.I.P Glaceon didn't make the cut I (63:53 - 63:58)
think Espeon also didn't mean doesn't (63:56 - 64:01)
make the cut for her team (63:58 - 64:04)
um uh (64:01 - 64:08)
you know when I see a team of six EVS on (64:04 - 64:10)
competitive ladder it does (64:08 - 64:12)
like I'm like oh this is gonna be like (64:10 - 64:16)
it's never exciting because they they (64:12 - 64:19)
can do a lot of great things like I (64:16 - 64:20)
think almost all of them learn baby doll (64:19 - 64:23)
eyes some of them are super fast (64:20 - 64:24)
um (64:23 - 64:27)
all has baby doll eyes it's baby doll (64:24 - 64:30)
eyes for days Sylveon in itself hits (64:27 - 64:33)
very hard I think the only like (64:30 - 64:34)
the only Eevee that's pretty laughable (64:33 - 64:37)
on ladder or just in anything is Flareon (64:34 - 64:38)
but (64:37 - 64:44)
but the rest of them are are are pretty (64:38 - 64:44)
um can be pretty threatening I will say (64:44 - 64:50)
I I was worried (64:46 - 64:50)
I can just give you my experience as an (64:50 - 64:55)
all-water team I was like ah this should (64:53 - 64:57)
be okay and then I forgot about Leafeon (64:55 - 65:00)
and Leafeon is very fast compared to my (64:57 - 65:02)
water Pokemon I I don't have any ice (65:00 - 65:05)
type moves so I don't have that coverage (65:02 - 65:07)
obviously no fire type moves I was like (65:05 - 65:10)
if I'm gonna lose the Leafeon and leaf (65:07 - 65:12)
and my my thought processes (65:10 - 65:15)
well gastrodon is the Ace here because (65:12 - 65:18)
gastrodon destroys Jolteon and gastrodon (65:15 - 65:21)
has no problem against uh Flareon or or (65:18 - 65:23)
the other ones so I need to keep gastron (65:21 - 65:25)
alive for after Leafeon Leafeon took out (65:23 - 65:27)
four team members it took four team (65:25 - 65:29)
members to shut down Leafeon but then (65:27 - 65:31)
after because I think leafeon's number (65:29 - 65:32)
two (65:31 - 65:34)
and then gastrodon was able to take out (65:32 - 65:36)
their four team members so it was it was (65:34 - 65:38)
really funny to see like this (65:36 - 65:41)
um this perspective of like I'm going to (65:38 - 65:43)
lose like you just ripped through four (65:41 - 65:45)
of my members and then my gastrodon was (65:43 - 65:46)
able to rip through four of their (65:45 - 65:49)
members after the Leafeon was down I (65:46 - 65:50)
thought the fight was fun (65:49 - 65:53)
um I I think they did a great job with (65:50 - 65:55)
her uh like (65:53 - 65:58)
caring and then but being scared at the (65:55 - 65:59)
same time because I think that in itself (65:58 - 66:02)
is relatable of like I care so much but (65:59 - 66:03)
I don't want to push the boundaries (66:02 - 66:05)
where like all of a sudden they don't (66:03 - 66:07)
care about me like where's the line of (66:05 - 66:09)
like (66:07 - 66:11)
uh I thought that was relatable but I (66:09 - 66:13)
don't know what your fight or thoughts (66:11 - 66:15)
on Penny were (66:13 - 66:16)
um (66:15 - 66:18)
Sylveon (66:16 - 66:21)
meet gigaton Hammer I'm sorry there's a (66:18 - 66:23)
there's a new reigning fairy in town and (66:21 - 66:25)
it's got a giant hammer and it crushes (66:23 - 66:27)
your soul and it did (66:25 - 66:33)
boy uh Penny's storyline of I'm worried (66:27 - 66:35)
about my friends and I don't know (66:33 - 66:36)
because I've never met them (66:35 - 66:41)
uh I I like again of the team star stuff (66:36 - 66:43)
I liked the Friendship aspect I think (66:41 - 66:47)
that was that was done well I think it's (66:43 - 66:51)
good for a game that has a worldwide (66:47 - 66:53)
audience to say you can still be friends (66:51 - 66:55)
with people you've never met and you (66:53 - 66:58)
only know them online it was a it was a (66:55 - 67:00)
nice thing to say out loud (66:58 - 67:03)
um was it surprising no was it deep no (67:00 - 67:07)
was it heartwarming sure (67:03 - 67:10)
um I think Penny's character (67:07 - 67:13)
the I like I knew exactly who she was (67:10 - 67:15)
from the minute I got the first phone (67:13 - 67:17)
call so I can't say that I was ever (67:15 - 67:19)
surprised (67:17 - 67:21)
um I can't say that like (67:19 - 67:24)
I I was shocked by her characterization (67:21 - 67:28)
I think she has a solid Arc I think one (67:24 - 67:33)
thing I will say about this game is the (67:28 - 67:36)
individual characters that you meet they (67:33 - 67:39)
give them very solid arcs (67:36 - 67:42)
um Arvin has a very solid Arc (67:39 - 67:46)
penny has a very solid Arc (67:42 - 67:46)
pneumonia has a straight line (67:46 - 67:50)
in kind of a little Arc we die we don't (67:50 - 67:55)
talk much about her but those two those (67:53 - 67:58)
two have really good human stories and I (67:55 - 67:59)
think (67:58 - 68:02)
again if Pokemon takes anything back (67:59 - 68:05)
from Sun and Moon and from scarlet and (68:02 - 68:10)
violet is make your stories human (68:05 - 68:12)
make them (68:10 - 68:14)
human make them in the people and the (68:12 - 68:17)
people are the focus because that's when (68:14 - 68:19)
it sings (68:17 - 68:19)
yeah I mostly agree with that I think um (68:20 - 68:25)
Penny other than being Cassiopeia (68:25 - 68:32)
um you know the the (68:29 - 68:34)
recluse that you end up becoming friends (68:32 - 68:37)
with was not exactly surprising to me (68:34 - 68:38)
um (68:37 - 68:41)
the her battle I didn't find massively (68:38 - 68:43)
challenging um I suspect that's probably (68:41 - 68:46)
because you know my thing is building (68:43 - 68:49)
out a good breadth of types yeah (68:46 - 68:52)
coverage thing so like EVS aren't (68:49 - 68:54)
difficult to take down when you have six (68:52 - 68:56)
Pokemon with a huge amount of game (68:54 - 68:57)
coverage (68:56 - 69:00)
exactly yeah yeah yeah so um my only (68:57 - 69:02)
real my only real-time coverage (69:00 - 69:03)
interestingly which I'm sure we'll talk (69:02 - 69:05)
in the next episode was was I didn't (69:03 - 69:07)
have any water (69:05 - 69:09)
um (69:07 - 69:09)
in this battle because you have a (69:11 - 69:16)
Flareon which is very easy to take down (69:14 - 69:18)
with a rock move right like there's no (69:16 - 69:19)
there's nothing difficult in that aspect (69:18 - 69:23)
yeah none of them have dual types so (69:19 - 69:25)
there's nothing complicated you have to (69:23 - 69:27)
do in your head you see you see water (69:25 - 69:30)
Eagle electric or grass you see grass (69:27 - 69:31)
you go fire you know that's that was (69:30 - 69:33)
pretty easy (69:31 - 69:34)
um I can see how it would be difficult (69:33 - 69:35)
if you're putting those restrictions on (69:34 - 69:38)
yourself which which you like to do (69:35 - 69:42)
yeah I I I think even if I had a normal (69:38 - 69:43)
team (69:42 - 69:45)
um which I assume most people listening (69:43 - 69:47)
to this have normal teams of you know (69:45 - 69:48)
trying to cover everything I think (69:47 - 69:51)
clavel is is by far harder I think Penny (69:48 - 69:53)
was more like Penny Penny's fight I (69:51 - 69:54)
don't think was supposed to be like (69:53 - 69:56)
difficult I think it was like (69:54 - 70:00)
let's battle okay like she never she (69:56 - 70:03)
never came across as somebody who (70:00 - 70:06)
like screamed I have a very good team (70:03 - 70:10)
like um like Erie did right like erie's (70:06 - 70:12)
team had really good coverage even (70:10 - 70:13)
though it was all fighting I mean that (70:12 - 70:16)
does pick up the one point that that did (70:13 - 70:17)
bother me about it is she was supposed (70:16 - 70:20)
to be the best who taught them all how (70:17 - 70:21)
to battle (70:20 - 70:23)
and you have a team of all EVS like and (70:21 - 70:26)
you're not you're not even as difficult (70:23 - 70:29)
as the Director is so um Yuri was the (70:26 - 70:30)
one that taught everyone how to battle (70:29 - 70:33)
not her (70:30 - 70:35)
here's the storyline was she taught the (70:33 - 70:38)
other four how to battle (70:35 - 70:38)
um it could be she was also supposed to (70:39 - 70:44)
be like if they see me lose I'm the top (70:41 - 70:46)
I'm the big boss and I'm like well (70:44 - 70:48)
you're easy to beat like how's somebody (70:46 - 70:50)
not beating you before well I think I (70:48 - 70:51)
think I think the reason that they'd (70:50 - 70:52)
never managed to be here before because (70:51 - 70:54)
you had to go through everyone else to (70:52 - 70:56)
do that first right their their rules (70:54 - 71:00)
around what they built out require (70:56 - 71:02)
you go through the five leaders to get (71:00 - 71:05)
to her first and then you get to the (71:02 - 71:06)
five leaders by going through the bases (71:05 - 71:08)
in that particular structure so she had (71:06 - 71:09)
to make you go through everyone (71:08 - 71:10)
otherwise she would just come to the (71:09 - 71:12)
beginning and say defeat me right right (71:10 - 71:15)
you know that and that's part of the (71:12 - 71:17)
story that I like is you know they're (71:15 - 71:19)
they're they they created a perception (71:17 - 71:22)
that they were super difficult and I (71:19 - 71:24)
think with the you know creating their (71:22 - 71:25)
safe spaces of like this is my home (71:24 - 71:27)
these are my people this is what I'm (71:25 - 71:30)
protecting is it is in itself like oh (71:27 - 71:32)
I'm just I'm gonna go around that I'm (71:30 - 71:33)
gonna ignore that like I don't want to (71:32 - 71:34)
mess with that (71:33 - 71:36)
um (71:34 - 71:38)
when in reality like (71:36 - 71:40)
no one really challenged them until you (71:38 - 71:43)
do because there was this Aura of like (71:40 - 71:46)
oh we just leave team star alone I I (71:43 - 71:49)
didn't comment it I did feel like oh (71:46 - 71:51)
why am I doing this because if this is (71:49 - 71:53)
indeed your people in your safe space (71:51 - 71:56)
I'm just coming in and plowing you all (71:53 - 72:00)
down and making you break up why so I (71:56 - 72:01)
think the point was that I know it (72:00 - 72:03)
wasn't just but yeah it wasn't just that (72:01 - 72:04)
it's a safe space because they continue (72:03 - 72:07)
having those same spaces after after the (72:04 - 72:09)
main game it's just that the structure (72:07 - 72:10)
they've gotten themselves into wasn't (72:09 - 72:12)
the best way to do it there's there's a (72:10 - 72:14)
lot of muddling of what they wanted to (72:12 - 72:16)
say yeah with this Spotlight that did (72:14 - 72:18)
not sit well with me I don't know I (72:16 - 72:20)
think I think they said I think they (72:18 - 72:23)
said it very well (72:20 - 72:23)
I I found it very relatable but yeah I (72:23 - 72:28)
mean I I will say this back to the (72:26 - 72:29)
people who said this to me if they'd (72:28 - 72:30)
written it better I would have related (72:29 - 72:32)
to it more (72:30 - 72:33)
um (72:32 - 72:35)
I mean I think it was written better (72:33 - 72:37)
that's what I said about it that's what (72:35 - 72:38)
I say about sun and moon so if you're (72:37 - 72:40)
going to say that right I get to say the (72:38 - 72:41)
same back to you no totally written (72:40 - 72:44)
better I would have related to it more (72:41 - 72:47)
and I didn't totally fair (72:44 - 72:52)
uh I still stand that uh I love the way (72:47 - 72:54)
the dialogue is written in these games I (72:52 - 72:56)
think I think (72:54 - 72:59)
especially like Arvin and as well we'll (72:56 - 73:03)
talk about nimona next time but even (72:59 - 73:04)
though like I don't think her character (73:03 - 73:06)
Arc is is is an arc I think it's kind of (73:04 - 73:07)
a line (73:06 - 73:10)
um I think how she talks her her little (73:07 - 73:11)
speech bubbles that you read I think (73:10 - 73:14)
they're so witty and so funny (73:11 - 73:16)
um and I think that applies to a lot of (73:14 - 73:17)
characters (73:16 - 73:19)
um throughout this entire series is I or (73:17 - 73:22)
this these two games this game (73:19 - 73:26)
needs some level of voice acting (73:22 - 73:29)
yes I think it needs at least a master's (73:26 - 73:31)
treatment (73:29 - 73:31)
I'm just thinking about like I did not (73:32 - 73:36)
enjoy the breath of the wild voice (73:34 - 73:39)
acting I didn't either because I found I (73:36 - 73:42)
found Zelda's voice so off-pitting and (73:39 - 73:45)
maybe maybe it's the anti-english bias (73:42 - 73:48)
in me I don't know she felt So Posh and (73:45 - 73:51)
uh by the way her listeners (73:48 - 73:51)
screaming screaming again (73:52 - 73:58)
cringy whenever it happened and you're (73:56 - 74:00)
just like I would rather it wasn't there (73:58 - 74:03)
I'm not clamoring for voice acting in (74:00 - 74:06)
these things no I'm not either (74:03 - 74:08)
um and I'm I'm worried that if they do (74:06 - 74:11)
go even the Masters route uh I'm worried (74:08 - 74:14)
that it's just like (74:11 - 74:14)
I I think of Ocarina of Time where Navi (74:15 - 74:20)
is just like Hey listen hey hey and (74:17 - 74:21)
that's a like a very obvious like (74:20 - 74:24)
everyone makes that joke but like (74:21 - 74:26)
when you're in a world you know for (74:24 - 74:28)
certain shield for me it was 2 000 hours (74:26 - 74:30)
for Sun and Moon it was 12 1200 hours (74:28 - 74:32)
for let's go Pikachu let's go Evie was (74:30 - 74:34)
900 hours when you're in a world that (74:32 - 74:36)
long do you want to hear like Hey listen (74:34 - 74:39)
hey hey wow catch wow do we have an (74:36 - 74:42)
example how how it actually could work (74:39 - 74:45)
which is Final Fantasy 14 which is the (74:42 - 74:47)
cut scenes are voice acted and the rest (74:45 - 74:50)
isn't yeah and I think the cut scenes (74:47 - 74:52)
having voice acting lends them more (74:50 - 74:55)
weight and gives a bigger feel and (74:52 - 74:57)
serves like we'll talk about it in the (74:55 - 75:00)
in the gym section but one gym leader (74:57 - 75:02)
definitely could have could have really (75:00 - 75:06)
had a great moment of voice acting (75:02 - 75:08)
um and you just sort of have to read it (75:06 - 75:11)
and it doesn't the reading of that does (75:08 - 75:14)
not convey the same power as if it was (75:11 - 75:16)
voice acted in the style that it was (75:14 - 75:17)
presented I think leaders would have (75:16 - 75:19)
benefited from one second I think all of (75:17 - 75:22)
them could have but I think I'm not (75:19 - 75:24)
saying like things in the world (75:22 - 75:25)
constantly chirping at you because that (75:24 - 75:27)
doesn't happen in Final Fantasy 14 but (75:25 - 75:29)
for big important cutscenes (75:27 - 75:32)
they come in and they have voices and (75:29 - 75:34)
those are very powerful moments and they (75:32 - 75:36)
really sing they're also really great (75:34 - 75:39)
for accessibility because people have (75:36 - 75:41)
reading comprehension problems that's (75:39 - 75:44)
true uh the worst way can we communicate (75:41 - 75:46)
is by reading only so people will read (75:44 - 75:48)
tone differently that if they're in a (75:46 - 75:51)
bad mood those dialogues can come off as (75:48 - 75:55)
very brisk or annoying that voice acting (75:51 - 75:58)
helps solve so in cut scenes I do think (75:55 - 76:00)
this game in a lot of places would have (75:58 - 76:03)
benefited from voice acting (76:00 - 76:06)
yes (76:03 - 76:06)
we're not there yet though maybe no (76:06 - 76:10)
we're not (76:08 - 76:12)
the game can't even run much let's get a (76:10 - 76:15)
voice out so well I mean I was gonna say (76:12 - 76:17)
even the cutscenes struggled to load in (76:15 - 76:18)
and then load out for some odd reason (76:17 - 76:20)
but (76:18 - 76:23)
um anyways uh so we're breaking these up (76:20 - 76:25)
into two episodes (76:23 - 76:26)
[Music] (76:25 - 76:30)
yeah so uh next week for episodes five (76:26 - 76:32)
and six uh because we did actually I (76:30 - 76:35)
think plan about six uh one should be (76:32 - 76:37)
the gym leader story and then one should (76:35 - 76:40)
be like kind of end of the game (76:37 - 76:43)
um like we were going to go up to Nemo (76:40 - 76:45)
uh to like the Elite Four and then stop (76:43 - 76:47)
and then everything afterwards which is (76:45 - 76:50)
after Arvin after the Elite Four that in (76:47 - 76:52)
itself was one episode as well and then (76:50 - 76:54)
that should be the series we could do a (76:52 - 76:56)
seventh of like overall thoughts we'll (76:54 - 76:58)
see how it goes but (76:56 - 76:59)
um depends how long we spend talking (76:58 - 77:02)
yeah (76:59 - 77:05)
I was I was happy with uh episode I was (77:02 - 77:06)
happy with to I mean we recorded this (77:05 - 77:08)
all in one session but it'll be broken (77:06 - 77:11)
up to two I thought it was great (77:08 - 77:11)
um (77:11 - 77:13)
I know some people expressed a little (77:11 - 77:15)
bit of frustration in episode two I (77:13 - 77:16)
think we were all frustrated for (77:15 - 77:18)
different reasons (77:16 - 77:19)
um but that's fine like just a (77:18 - 77:21)
disclosure here like no lovely (77:19 - 77:23)
discussion we all left that like pretty (77:21 - 77:26)
like happy we were like yeah that's a (77:23 - 77:28)
good episode and there was part of me (77:26 - 77:31)
that was like yeah do I cut the (77:28 - 77:33)
misunderstanding I had with Greg which (77:31 - 77:35)
happens all the time me and Greg it's me (77:33 - 77:37)
I I misunderstood it happens all the (77:35 - 77:38)
time if you're listening to the audience (77:37 - 77:41)
Greg is shaking his head uh (77:38 - 77:45)
but the problem with me cutting that is (77:41 - 77:48)
it one it makes it seem like (77:45 - 77:50)
I'm not listening to Greg so if I just (77:48 - 77:52)
cut it and get to the point where like (77:50 - 77:54)
okay there's a point in that episode (77:52 - 77:57)
where we're like okay we're all on the (77:54 - 77:58)
same page now (77:57 - 78:00)
and if I cut it (77:58 - 78:04)
I I think it's just a big disservice to (78:00 - 78:06)
Greg or to Al whoever whoever was Art (78:04 - 78:07)
like we were all talking about other (78:06 - 78:09)
things of them being able to express (78:07 - 78:11)
their point (78:09 - 78:14)
uh because if if I misunderstood that (78:11 - 78:16)
um I am sure there are other people that (78:14 - 78:18)
also misunderstood it and I think that's (78:16 - 78:20)
important and I think it's important (78:18 - 78:21)
that like (78:20 - 78:24)
we can have disagreements and still get (78:21 - 78:26)
to the end where it's like I understand (78:24 - 78:28)
what you're saying Greg I disagree with (78:26 - 78:30)
you about the map (78:28 - 78:32)
but I understand what you're saying I (78:30 - 78:34)
understand where you're coming from (78:32 - 78:36)
um so that's why that's why I kept it in (78:34 - 78:37)
can we talk about one thing that that (78:36 - 78:40)
about this game that frustrates me (78:37 - 78:42)
to talk about that you're trying to find (78:40 - 78:45)
appears while you're in the battle and (78:42 - 78:46)
when you get out of the battle they're (78:45 - 78:48)
nowhere to be found you should have done (78:46 - 78:50)
a better battle they would have watched (78:48 - 78:52)
you if the battle is more interesting it (78:50 - 78:53)
sat there the entire time instead I have (78:52 - 78:56)
this creeper Psyduck who always shows up (78:53 - 78:58)
behind me and is staring at me I have a (78:56 - 79:01)
creeping Psyduck stalker and it freaks (78:58 - 79:03)
me out every time (79:01 - 79:05)
I did have an amazing moment when I came (79:03 - 79:08)
out of a battle and there were like six (79:05 - 79:10)
weasel all surrounding me in a circle (79:08 - 79:13)
already to pounce (79:10 - 79:16)
which was just very funny oh I just (79:13 - 79:18)
remembered one one last team star thing (79:16 - 79:19)
that annoyed me (79:18 - 79:22)
see if you jump into one of the bases (79:19 - 79:26)
from somewhere I was going to oh this is (79:22 - 79:28)
not where you're meant to come in go (79:26 - 79:30)
back to where you were and come in (79:28 - 79:31)
through the gate yeah and you're like (79:30 - 79:34)
okay sure fine I understand that because (79:31 - 79:36)
that's your rules but then what happens (79:34 - 79:38)
in the game is you're back where you (79:36 - 79:40)
were so I jumped off a cliff into a team (79:38 - 79:42)
star base and then after this quick (79:40 - 79:44)
cutscene I was back on top of the cliff (79:42 - 79:46)
how did I get back on top of the cliff (79:44 - 79:50)
yeah right on can't climb Cliffs yet (79:46 - 79:54)
put me at the front door they dragged (79:50 - 79:55)
you up (79:54 - 79:57)
with a scruffing your neck and threw you (79:55 - 80:00)
up there yeah I never did that because I (79:57 - 80:02)
was just worried that the game would (80:00 - 80:05)
crash (80:02 - 80:08)
that was absolutely valid because I (80:05 - 80:11)
think in Legends if you jumped in to (80:08 - 80:13)
where cresselio was (80:11 - 80:15)
behind the gate (80:13 - 80:16)
it broke (80:15 - 80:18)
uh and then it took them like three (80:16 - 80:21)
weeks to patch that where like it would (80:18 - 80:23)
say like catch Cresselia but you already (80:21 - 80:24)
did (80:23 - 80:26)
and then it would never complete that (80:24 - 80:27)
quest line and they they did end up (80:26 - 80:30)
patching that in Legends to fix it (80:27 - 80:32)
um and I was I was like I don't want to (80:30 - 80:33)
risk breaking this game by jumping into (80:32 - 80:35)
the base when I'm not supposed to I (80:33 - 80:36)
wanted to try it though (80:35 - 80:38)
um the other thing I want to try is I (80:36 - 80:41)
wanted to try to see how hard it would (80:38 - 80:43)
be with like (80:41 - 80:45)
if I took three grass Pokemon into the (80:43 - 80:46)
let's go feature against Mella because (80:45 - 80:48)
with once the Titan like that side of (80:46 - 80:50)
Titan got knocked out I was I'm curious (80:48 - 80:52)
if it's possible to do that in 10 (80:50 - 80:55)
minutes with like the weakness and then (80:52 - 80:57)
get to the mellophyte I think that would (80:55 - 80:58)
