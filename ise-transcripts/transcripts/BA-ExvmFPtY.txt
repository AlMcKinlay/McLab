[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 270 ninth episode of the Pokemon podcast it's super effective my name is s BJ and I'm here today okay so I'm recording this at like 11 o'clock at night I just got back from vacation people are staying in my house so that's why my voice is a bit quieter and I'm probably not sounding as energetic as I usually sound really weird show for you guys today so just bear with me here I'm gonna run through what's gonna happen I've been on vacation for like the last week so his will we both went to Gen Con will is still on vacation he's still on Jed cot he's still at Gen Con right now so if that's why he's not here I recorded an interview with reversal who is a very big Pokemon go youtuber so I recorded that last week before I went on vacation I cut and edited that's ready to go that's 45 minutes of me talking with reversal about Pokemon go the state of Pokemon his thoughts on Pokemon go fast so that will be pretty much after this little intro and of course because I went on vacation a bunch of Pokemon news dropped pokemon world was happening I wanted to go to Worlds but I already had everything booked for Gen Con and Gen Con for me is a personal vacation that I take every year that I don't really do anything Pokemon related at all that news that dropped cuz there's a bunch of news that dropped will and I will talk about that all next week I know there's a lot I know you guys probably want to hear it but because we'll still on vacation and I wanted to make sure that you guys got an episode this Monday I'm just gonna run down the news real quick I know you guys already know what it is but in case you missed something I'm just gonna run down that real quick again we'll talk about it all next week there's been a ton of emails about thanking Travis and Travis's time on the show we are gonna get to all of those next week I don't know how long next week's episode is but we have a lot to cover so just keep that in mind this episode is so really good though the interview with reversal is fantastic he's such a fantastic dude so I can't wait for you guys to hear the interview let me just run down the news real quick that happened and fill you guys in in case you were not up-to-date or you weren't following the world information and I actually might miss something myself here again I only really went over it just recently because I've been driving all day but there will be packaged versions of Pokemon go and silver coming containing a download code for the eShop available in Europe on September 22nd pretty cool if you just want a box again still downloadable though so you're gonna need internet for that there was a new ultra Sun and ultra moon trailer shown pretty good timing with worlds and everything I suspected that it would have been shown at Worlds or slightly after worlds especially we weren't going to get anything with the pokemon go stuff that has been happening so that happened they showed an updated map for a Lola and there is like what seems to be like a wormhole that's opened up on it I haven't spent enough time looking at it and reading people's theories but a new map kind of like how black and white 2 had a slight change it seems to be an oozy ring coming out for stores it's a black sea ring with new z powers that Tommy Tommy will be releasing as you know ultrasound ultra moon coming out November 17th they showed the official box art for that pokemon gold and silver will also have physical races in Japan going back to the ultrasonic ultramoon trailer the main characters the protagonist protagonists have new clothes so I guess that's exciting hopefully there will be pants what one can one can hope TCG wise this is pretty big news for the TCG and I actually at Gen Con III said that Junkins not a Pokemon related thing for me but I did enter a booster Draft at Gen Con with the TCG I played with well I played with Irene I played with Micah played with a bunch of other friends so we we do plan on talking about that next week I know sometimes we we go weeks without talking about the TCG but this is a big thing here it also announced that worlds that the ultra beasts are coming to the TCG games they showed off buzz wall and Gus Lord as TCG cards going back to the Z ring that I was talking about there will be new Z in ultra Sutton ultramoon one of them was showing off for a coma Auto gets an exclusive Z move called clangorous solo blaze which if you watch the trailer it one shots both Salem ants and a Garchomp at the same time it can hit both Pokemon does like this little song seems to be really powerful seems to be a really good counter to these pseudo legendaries that seem to be dominant in the VGC format probably over by now but during worlds in Anaheim there was Kangaskhan appearing and more Taurus appearing tauros makes sense for all the international travelers and competitors that were coming to make sure that they got our region specific Pokemon which is Taurus in the u.s. kangaskhan which is an Australian exclusive appearing in Anaheim because of the pokemon world championships on top of that unknown the rarest Pokemon in Pokemon go right now appearing in Anaheim as well what's really cool about unknown and we've talked about this before but when unknown appears at these events which is the third event first was sugar the Pokemon go fest in Chicago then it was the the Safari Zone stuff in Europe and then the Yokohama stuff in Japan at Pikachu outbreak here in Anaheim the unknown spelled world's so possible to get a wo are L D and s unknown to fill out that pokedex for you if you're you know set on trying to collect all 26 unknown and when Gen 3 comes out all twenty-eight ultrasounded ultramoon are also going to feature what's called a Lola Photo Club I haven't read too much about that but that's something we'll be talking about next week or each op wise if you have a Nintendo switch there will be a demo for pokken tournament DX so if you haven't played it you own a switch so which seems to be doing way better than the Wii U that is something coming they showed some artwork for the kamon iam Z which is the Z crystal for como oh oh and finally and then they I apologize I'm probably missing some news finally the 2018 World Championships will be held in Nashville Tennessee next year 2018 so that might be easier for people to travel to and it might be cheaper hopefully they can accommodate or they're piling for more people to come since it does seem to be from what I have gathered on social media a place that people are very excited to go to just because of cost and because of getting there alone California that whole area is one very expensive to travel to and to kind of hard to get to by car especially if you're coming from like New York or Boston or Atlanta or even though most of the Midwest where Nashville is more centralized between that so that is the bit of news I have and that's it yes so hopefully next week will be a really really exciting show like I said will will join me will cover all this more in depth and tackle your guys's emails because there's been a lot of great emails this week if you have your own email questions comments concerns about the show you can email me at SB j at pkmn cast comm otherwise we're gonna switch over to the interview with reversal again we talked about Pokemon go we talked about his history with Pokemon we talked about clickbait because that's a hot topic on YouTube but I'll let you guys hear it yeah there might be a little bit of outro at the end of the show I'm not sure yet again it's late I'm trying to get this all cut and edited for you guys but enjoy [Music] [Music] the vapor man [Music] [Music] the vapor man man all right guys we are back and I am here with reversal Pokemon go youtuber yellow thank you for inviting me I'm great how are you I'm good I'm good like all our interviews I'm mitsue perfective we'll start off with some Pokemon we'll probably actually talk a little bit about your YouTube career since that is that is your big thing and then we'll end with Pokemon mm-hmm just a little agenda here but let's kind of talk about how we met it was at Pokemon go fest yeah Chicago actually yeah it was really nice it was kind of unexpected saw this guy with this equipment like audio camera source I mean audio equipment that was like oh that's interesting then I found out you've got a podcast and everything else kind of intrigue I don't want to talk about YouTube right off the bat but you know I've always been told that the YouTube community is is very close-knit very tight together they have each other's backs and I think that was very apparent at Pokemon go fest I walk into like the media tent and all you guys knew each other and by I mean all you guys I mean you know trainer tips and twin tendo and you and a bunch of other people that I apologized that I didn't know who they were and then mystic 666 but you guys seem to be like this this pretty tight community of you know youtubers yeah partially because it took Niantic such a long time to reach out to any of us and because of that we can alike we're like you know we kind of probably like stick together seeing as some of the initial comfort encouraged because everybody was you know almost creating like let's say all the mainstream youtubers everybody went in on Pokemon go because it was such a big thing this is normal it got some views but then they start to drop off one at a time and eventually there's this tight group of dedicated content creators we HR sticking with Pokemon go and eventually got to the point where you want to go out and travel and you start to talk to each other to get insights into certain scenarios and it's like hey do you know anything about this or do you know anything about that and if actually become friends so that's where most of us not everybody but most of us I already knew each other before Pokemon go fast got it let's back up a little bit for my listeners that may not know who you are what you do I said you're a youtuber I said Pokemon go but what exactly do you do on a day to day basis so I keep myself visit with Pokemon go I should know I just primarily I only right now do Pokemon go content on my youtube channel and I really like to bring Pokemon go from him from an experience as if the viewer the player the one interest in Bochum ago actually were to be there so I I tried to get some cool shots in from time to time but mostly I'd like to keep it real and I'd like to to share my perspective as a passionate player to my audience so that's what I'm doing so I'm an overly enthusiastic pokemon go player with essentially a youtube channel that that's the gist of this really poor Pokemon you know being as big as it as it is now with Pokemon go where did your love of Pokemon stem from it's you know I know because I've been following you for a while but where did that develop elementary school essentially I'm 28 now so I grew up on Pokemon I was in sixth grade where I was ten years old when Pokemon go what pokemon got released and it it exploded it came a little bit later in Europe because I'm from the Netherlands it came a little bit later to the Netherlands than it came in the u.s. so I think a year or two later or so it got introduced in my country and the moment it hit Fox kids at the time it just was an instant hit and everybody was talking about it and a Trading car soon followed up and they had the Gameboy game and literally everything Kame pokemon it was like the the biggest race there's nothing like you know frigid spinners are a thing now yeah yeah imagine that explosion of interest but then multiplied by five six even ten times and then you have Pokemon so everybody knew Pokemon everybody lift Pokemon essentially this little kid everybody was interested so yeah if you weren't into Pokemon you said she would be out so yeah that's where we all grew up on Pokemon it's funny you bring up fidget spinners because that's let's look the big hot fad right now but I felt like people thought that of Pokemon at the time oh yeah this is a fad and it'll burn out and it it definitely like decreased in popularity but I don't think it ever burnt out I think right now in fact whenever Pokemon go got released it reached an all-time high because you had because obviously it's been 20 years since and the all-time I feel the all-time interest in Pokemon has achieved its peak with Pokemon ghosts released because you have older generations people that aren't interested in Pokemon go and the newer generation which are right now all part of this thing called Pokemon which you all have a common interest in and then of course you got the the game boys and the DS versions and the 3ds versus now so yes it's really really big so growing up you mentioned the games and the card games did you ever like fall out of Pokemon or was that something that you stuck through through xx a long time 20 years but did you stick through it the 20 years interest has always been sort of there in the back of my mind but yeah I just fall out of it I around sapphire and ruby emerald that's was I played dos until my cartridge actually broke because my my gameboy advance didn't really manage well I guess threw off the usage but after that I I kind of grew up I guess a little bit and I fell out of Pokemon and I tried the black and white a little bit but that didn't really resonate with me it was a little bit like strange like all these chandeliers and like ice cream with my faces on this and I was right here yeah then with Pokemon go it just came out back I guess ok so it was it was really Pokemon go that brought you back in fully yeah I guess so yeah yeah now your your YouTube career a little bit a little bit interesting compared to maybe others but you were like super into clash of clans in clash Royale if I'm not mistaken yeah yeah are you still playing those games or is it now 7% Pokemon go Pokemon go go at least I haven't touched the game since it's just been having a weird effect on me but yeah I used to play it call for those games and used to play those games and I would even visit the developers at their headquarters in finland helsinki and it was all great but it's just like I feel that Pokemon go kind of filled up the gap of emptiness it's really strange to explain but doing content on YouTube for a specific game like clash Royale or boom Beach clash of clans you just sit in in your house all day trying to figure out like hey what is the next video that I am gonna try to produce because I wasn't I'm not like super established youtuber at the time I was just reached 100,000 subscriber mark which is a lot of people but you haven't made it yet so to speak if you reach that point so you still have to innovate and come up with interesting content you still gotta work so hard in order to make sure you stay relevant to a certain degree and then when Pokemon go got released it was like all of these videos they could just come out and I would have so much fun doing them and I and I still very much hope the same feeling towards that so it's just such a nice thing to go outside to shoot a video instead of being inside and crease your brain about what to do next I have it up right here it looks like July 6 2016 was your first Pokemon go video a half a million views yeah and I'm not seeing I'm not seeing any anything but Pokemon go after that yeah I just think that's interesting because it it and and I would love for you to explain it you had a following of these clash Royale players and these clash of clans players and they probably you know woke up on July is it July July 6 June 6 yeah July 6 July 6 and all of a sudden you know they're not seeing the game associated with your face anymore they're seeing a new game it's weird yeah thinking about it now that's just putting it this way see if it's it's it's pretty weird knuckle eyes is really weird yeah that's that's that's the gist of them that's the story yeah it was gone so did you did you lose though did you lose that audience did you have a I imagine you said when you started from zero again but you know if they're not if they're not in a Pokemon they're not in a Pokemon okay so it has a strange effect on my channel my channel if you if you were to make a change like that now your channel is there's no the hype you will clearly notice it but because there are so many new people coming into the channel and checking out the videos I barely noticed me losing that initial audience but I think it's fair to say that less than 10% of that original viewer base is actually still watching my videos at this point Wow but that was that okay I'm backing up again lots of backing up in this episode it's fine that's fine well you we we all we all knew Pokemon go was coming so when when we got the initial I think we knew I don't know six eight months prior to it dropping that okay here it's gonna come the summer it's gonna be this big thing when you first heard that announcement did you think I want to get on that Pokemon go bandwagon or was it something that like no kind of right before you decided not at all it kind of caught me by surprise so I I was I I did say I did see the trainer drop on the day of itself because it was training on YouTube and everybody was sending it to me I was like whoa this is insane but I honestly have no idea how it was going to working that little in some way shape or form it kind of seemed to be good too good to be true and essentially it was like there's no denying that like the trailer was absolutely stunning but the actual experience was a little bit different but it just took stuck with me for a while then I I just kind of forgot about it and then I got a message from one of my friends on Facebook and he said hey geo uh spoken when go thing it dropped the air in Australia I was like Oh what are you serious I was just interested to see what it was gonna be like I never knew it was gonna be such a big thing now like I knew it was interesting I just didn't know how big it was gonna be I always kind of kicked myself because you know I've been doing this this Pokemon podcast for seven years and so I do everything Pokemon whether that's the card game the anime the video game you know magic harp jump whatever whatever Pokemon throws at me I'll try to cover it and so when go came out I was like great I'm gonna do you know I'm gonna do this miniseries just focusing and go you know that went as well as I could connect to the servers because of all those issues at the beginning yeah you know and I thought I definitely saw an uptick in listeners when when go came out just know no denying that but I had no expectations that it would hit the height that it did and I don't think anyone would have been able to predict that yeah because I think at least from your standing point I would imagine that you you think it would be like as if the new Pokemon game got released right right yeah so I definitely understand that yeah so it's like I could I could've did more but in and you know what it's whatever right you know I I continued talking about Pokemon I still love it there's that regret of like I could've did more but for you you did the first video and it took off and then you know you started doing more with athletic artists yeah oh that's that that first video is actually a livestream it's not even a video the first seven or eight videos were just live streams and there was one video in between which was like a recap of what I had done because I was just so busy playing the game the only thing that I was thinking like okay you know I should probably stream this because I'm just having too much fun playing the game I had no intention of going in doors to my home especially summer it was it was really hot at the time I had no intention of going back to my computer and added everything so it's like let's just you know do a stream and let's make that the video so that as lazy as it was that was the content really you do you're doing the Pokemon stuff that that's getting traction you I guess I'm curious at this point in in your YouTube career were you doing YouTube full-time or was that the Pokemon go stuff that pushed it over the edge for you um I was at the phase where my channel was growing it wasn't a growing face so I could already do you two full-time which I did the Pokemon pushed it over the edge to do it full-time without stressing about like having to retain my audience or anything like that that kind of came naturally so yeah what's already doing it full-time would became a little bit more comfortable to do so what made you decide to do YouTube as a career mm-hmm I don't know exactly when that when that decision was made I always saw YouTube as a part-time kind of thing I still remember I was looking for for a job in a mentorship function because my previous work before YouTube that mine you to come and started building and as I was like looking for a different job I just did this YouTube thing on the side because I noticed like hey this is one month I'm gonna earn 16 bucks and the next month it will be 26 so it would be kind of nice to have a little bit extra financially but it wasn't about the money at all it's just like oh hey this videos that I was making already I can get like a little bit of money from that so that that idea it struck something with me because it was like hey my work is meaningful in some way shape or form so from that perspective I started sort of building and I started you know creating content while I was still looking for a job but then I realized I enjoyed doing this video creation process I enjoyed it so much that I was like hey maybe this is something that I can pursue like full-time on a part-time basis so it still it would actually be a thing that I'll dedicate time to be true the Urmi money so it's essentially like a job but still do something on the side and after a while I just was like I honestly don't feel like looking for anything because it was really tough time at that moment 2014 - to find a job for me because there was a lot of things happening in like looking for jobs since it was pretty hard to find something so I just started putting more focus and emphasis on youtube and yeah with enough navigation and hour hours put into it and staying consistent it actually look kind of like no got to a place where I am earning a full-time income I guess no no that won't make sense I want to bring up something a little controversial here clickbait mmm I've heard that your videos you know are more click baby than other Pokemon go people but you and other youtubers are so involved in the YouTube scene it's it's it's your life it's your job how do you feel when you know people say that or you know you come across that and you see nothing but thumbnails with arrows and and big X's and stuff like yeah is that just what you have to do to survive or where are your thoughts on that yes you'd have to do that to survive and it's kind of sad that YouTube has become that way you also believe I'm always real with this yes I do click they I think everybody that has some sort of you know audience click baits to a certain degree however I feel that mainstream click bait is misunderstood usually whenever a video has like arrows and stuff people essentially are like click bait but essentially it's just like you you only got so many moments on a viewer for them to get interested in your video so you need to come up with something that triggers the person to click on your video hands the bait but there's a thin line of Understanding between what is click bait and what is misleading and I don't think click bait is bad I mean I I notice it myself is if I see an asteroid or something like that or something that I'm personally interested in and then someone makes this stuff like the top 10 Pokemon that you never knew what special ability they have and you won't believe what number four is matters automatically like kind of interested to see hey what is that all about and if the information is disappointed is disappointing in their part then they automatically will have a negative idea towards that and that's her whole like perfection becomes a mainstream because more people become aware of what a clickbait actually is but I think it's still very gray what good click that is the one that drags you in and the issue with a feeling satisfaction and the one that makes you click on it and then you're like this is not even related to what the video is all about so yeah I see what you're saying yeah do you know do you notice though like a difference between video and video be if video be is is very click baby and you know title and thumbnail and video a is possibly the same if not better content but maybe you know doesn't have huge words or all caps or is there really a huge distinctive difference between the amount of use you get yeah there really is there really is the thing is a lot of people are are not in this whole YouTube scene like a lot of people are just watching it because they have a question like what I used to do I used to watch like walkthroughs like if I were to be playing games I would I would be getting stuck on a particular part of a game and I'd be like oh how do I get there so nowadays in 2017 the way it is it's like people understand that content creators and youtubers and search and they will play in on that question so if you're like hey how do I beat this gym leader in in Pokemon X&Y you got like a million of different types of result but the one that is speaking the most out there like the one with the most arrows and to something that points it out and really grabs your attention that can be a click baby video so yeah it's it's it's it's kind of interesting how that has changed from the way it used to be I mean I think that that's a question a lot of people ask I appreciate you answering it no it's fine it's I understand that people ask the question because I'll be the exact same but it's just like yeah we all do clickbait if someone tells me that they're no click bed and that that's honestly just a lie because we all as content creators try to get so many people in because it supports us in some way shape or form but it all comes down to the integrity of the youtuber it's very important to understand whether someone is doing it just for the views or someone really wants to get their content out there they're just you got like so many channels out there which you just only care for the money but have no integrity behind their YouTube channel because they only just want to get rich quickly I guess yeah yeah totally going back to we know we brought this up at the beginning of the the conversation but you know me meeting you at Pokemon go fast that day was such a blur in retrospect because of everything that was happening but what was what was your overall thoughts on Pokemon go fast I asked him that from a player perspective were you two're I mean I guess both you know I I originally went I had this game plan of hey I'm gonna get into the park early I'm gonna shoot some content and I normally don't shoot video of stuff I'm primarily an audio-only guy but my friend let me a camera so I stopped shot some video of the park early I was gonna you know meet with all the other media people try to get a couple of interviews and then I was actually gonna spend you know most of the day just playing the game and then you know shoot some more video at the end of the day especially one the six o'clock quote-unquote legendary event was supposed to happen and then you know continued playing for the night so my day plant my plan was you know get some video get some content that's gonna take you know two three hours of my day but then enjoy the rest of the day as a player and obviously that didn't that didn't turn out that well yeah but you know your thoughts so as a player I'm actually gonna justified it into some ways to you know make it more relatable as I do it on my channel I guess so as a player it was a complete disaster I'm not gonna lie about that it was an absolute disaster there's so many things that went wrong it was coming concerning for me early on whenever I got mail I got a notification on my phone I tried to open up my gmail and that took me two minutes us like there's something wrong here then I went to the media lounge and we have like separate wife are there and I tried connecting there and that kind of sort of worked I guess because it was like a dedicated Wi-Fi setting at the time I immediately knew oh this is an issue that is beyond my antic I feel because I cannot even connect to because there's so many people using the service itself then I was thinking like hey what can potentially cost that and the one thing that came to mind for me as a consumer was like hey I imagined it being New Year's Eve and it's about 12 o'clock and you're texting off your friends and making phone calls to wish everybody happy new year and you cannot do it because service is really slow and something so forth and then it struck me like hey everybody is trying to play this mobile game at the exact same time there's no way that this is ever going to be okay so when every whenever in the antic spoke to us about hey we're trying to fix this was like you guys are probably never going to be able to fix that today because it's just like it's a disaster this print came in got there hot spots made it definitely more bearable for spring users which was great but everybody else was having some issues especially on t-mobile and that was alright it was decent I could open up the app and my Pokemon GoPros device would notify me of a Pokemon being there and I could actually catch it but I couldn't visually see the Pokemon itself mm-hmm and then later that day what my auntie did which was very awesome is that they do you know the little animation on the lumo juice with the little pink Leafs yeah like the sparkles exactly they removed that because you know it it kind of put a strain on people's phones because the the the animation itself apparently in some way shape or form kind of effects the way you're playing and if it's very lag --is-- then you're you have a bad experience so they removed that and more people as a result were able play but they didn't go well at all the events it was a complete mess the compensation I feel was communicated in a poor way I think they they could have brought like the news earlier have a back-up plan just in case something would be going wrong I feel that the idea with the the radius of the events the distance where pokken will be popping up and the special actor will be there there was communicated a little bit clumsy so as a player I didn't really enjoy Pokemon go fast a whole lot but that's a content creator on YouTube it was the best day ever because it got to meet so many people so that's two stories there so I definitely understand that a lot of players were upset so easy to the core where some people would be leaving the park I think at the end of the day though my auntie came up with a better event like after the the the Pokemon office itself was was bad right yep but the event after go fast like the two days after Pokemon go fast were the best days was better than Pokemon go fast itself I feel because yep the legendaries the Holman percent catch rate and the event itself with the double experience extra starters the ACT distance which was cut in in 33% so it was it was terrific but it came a little bit too late I think a lot of people will remember Pokemon go fast for their failures and not how awesome it became after the actual event yeah yeah I completely agree with you I think I may be caught you know four or five Pokemon during the actual hours that poke my office is scheduled but afterwards oh I caught hundreds of Pokemon across a known III exactly I actually drove down that day I live about an hour and a half away and I had so much fun after 7 p.m. and since they extended the event I came back down on Sunday it's like I don't care how much parking is I want more Pokemon Co yeah how did you feel about like every I think you saw that maybe as well or maybe it is something that I'm going to tell you but literally every single lugia rate had 500 people standing there try like I'm not talking about the ones in their part but every single one of them oh yeah I loved it yeah it was crazy so yeah we great I will never forget that it's even crazier than when Pokemon go got started on a few yes yeah I wanted to run something by you I haven't talked about this on the podcast but I feel like this is a great great place to talk about it just because yeah you know you were at Pokemon go fast so I have a for again you know I'm not I'm not I'm not saying this is this is a hundred percent source I'm not saying that this is right I'm just you know throwing it out there and and would love to hear your thoughts but I have a friend who works at a corporate 18 tea store and not at Pokemon go fast I shouldn't say store he works at corporate 18 tea right so I you know I told him about the day I told him that 18 tea Wi-Fi worked fine I was able to connect to it at the mini Evette I'm on AT&T my girlfriend's on Sprint hers was off and on all day and we know that Sprint had a cow out there cow being cellular on wheels they had one oh I see but 18t verizon they refused to bring cows out but Sprint had one and then there were pretty much no one could connect now on top of no one could connecting no one could really even make phone calls I tried calling somebody on Sprint on 18 T on US Cellular I could barely get through and if the call did connect it was a lot of like hello hello hello like I could hear each other saying hello my my friend at AT&T said you know Lollapalooza lots of big events take place at Grant Park and so AT&T is aware of the foot traffic that Grant Park brings in and because and he said that because calls couldn't even be made that there that that led to something more that people aren't talking about because apparently data the data network and the phone call network are completely different networks that don't interact with each other so even if your data is completely busted you should be able to still make a phone call he is he is confident and again you know who's to say he is confident that knee antic tried to put out something again the cellular network in terms to prevent spoof errs and because they did that that is what actually caused the network to fail and could never recover oh wow okay this is a big one and I thought that was really interesting especially yeah when I went down on Sunday night that that whole park was still a dead zone there were no there was no one there and I still couldn't get service yeah I noticed I noticed something like that I was the day after I was incredibly sick I will state the sick in my hotel until six o'clock in the evening where I finally decide I need to get out get some fresh air because I've been in bed all day and eventually you start to feel uncomfortable and kind of need to get out so the weather was coming nice and just figure I need to go outside and then close to the park there were a couple of legendary raids and I attempted to do them but I just couldn't get in I could get in but I would get Network error or I would disconnect and I would restart the app and it took forever and then in other parts I could play normally so it was almost like it just like a block or two away it worked perfect yeah yeah exactly and I thought that was strange but now that you're saying that they could might as well been in that case for sure which which is really weird when you think about it because they already extended the reach of the event so I don't understand why that would still be there at the park itself and and I thought the QR code was a good solution get there scan the QR code okay now you can play and there were there were leaks of some QR codes and obviously that would that would draw spoofer to the event but the the the mindset of nee antek putting out something to prevent spoof errs does make sense and but again it doesn't make sense that they were if they were locking the content behind the QR code but I mean I I could see them doing it I'm not saying that's that that's a hundred percent what happened but it is when you look at Sunday night 24 hours after the event and that area was still a dead zone that just doesn't make sense for from a network perspective yeah it doesn't and I honestly feel that I am should have had better contacts I don't know what happens beyond disease I've just been invited as a special guest with the other youtubers and people from media to attend Ethan but I in no way shape or form know what's happening that then was just explored of my antique or any of the context that they're having some also just speculating in that aspect but a few base of what I've heard that Niantic should have had better contact with AT&T did things went well with Sprint but seeing that only Sprint came out with their cow and got that connection up a little bit better tells me something that you know could things could have been better just on the community out the communication aspect or is the other natural providers for sure yeah yeah let's shift gears a little bit to an event that seems to be pretty successful the Pokemon go safari event that's happening in Europe right now and it's weird it's a weird one tell me about that what it what is that like because I feel like everyone here in in America even if they didn't go to Pokemon go fest they knew a hundred percent of what happened what it was like what they missed what they didn't miss and I feel like I'm kind of in the dark with the with the Europe event like what is actually going on there okay it is so it's good that you're speaking me about that because I've been through the safari zone myself and I live in Europe it is canceled or postponed what you're seeing right now safari zone Europe is not the actual safari zone but it's kind of like a suede Oh Safari Sun is not the real Safari Zone but it has like traits of it right now in Europe you have the capability in select cities and we need to back up a little bit before I get to that so Niantic has a partnership with a bunch of moss and the mall company is called unibrow Tomko and they have malls all across Europe make mostly in big cities like Copenhagen Paris Berlin Amsterdam Stockholm Oslo like they got all these big cities covered with a mall and the mall itself is actually kind of like a four star ish mall it's like a little bit more extravagant like a little bit more luxurious you have an expensive stores ton little fanciest what I was looking for so they got these and because everybody knows these malls are pretty expensive I feel they they have this partnership and they have this partnership already with ingress which is the predecessor of Pokemon go to deploy polka stops at these locations and the density of these polka stops is quite insane I'm talking about over 20 focus stops within one mall of which you can reach five six seven or sometimes even eight while standing in one location that's the craziness we're talking about here yeah so obviously then knowing that players knowing that they come flocking to these locations and myself included up into Denmark have been to Stockholm I've been to Amsterdam and I've been to Germany very recently and I will be coming back there a couple of times because the place is honestly too good to play out but the way they got it set up right now know now that this is all advertised and these models are there and everybody knows that these moths are there the safari zone itself the event was going to be happening on the 5th and the 12th of August and there was going to be another event at the 16th of September the 5th of August and 12th of August have been postponed until later date which is right now unknown so what they've done alternatively is they have deployed Genghis Khan and unknowns at these locations and now they have extended the radius by 25 miles or 40 kilometers it is not the real safari zone yet all these just these extra special spawns which already so cool because Genghis Khan obviously is the Australian hmm the Oceania reaching exclusive and that's now available in Europe and we already know how tough it is to catch an unknown in the Wow because it's the rarest Pokemon so those Pokemon are they're very commonly and the actual safari zone is gonna look something like pokemon go fast and that event that scored yapping in Japan Pokemon play park mm-hmm where there's going to be special raids there's going to be team lounges there's going to be an increased spawn of particular Pokemon but we don't know anything about else but that that's going to be happening so we have to see about that so in Chicago the unknown spelled Chicago and you you said that the unknown spell you're up there but you also said I believe on Twitter too that you're seeing other letters is that true still yeah so that's that's actually true I was there at the mall I haven't seen it myself but I've seen it on people's accounts that they called different types of unknowns other than the ones in Europe so my understanding or my theory behind this is that they also upped the response of other letters of a nun's so I are you in the position where you're just missing all the letters now at this point yeah I'm missing that's the last Pokemon they need well besides that besides the rest of the unknown dollars but just yeah I'm missing I'm missing one Pokemon and then you probably see you I miss a giraffe Rick you're missing giraffe rig yeah oh man if you're Milwaukee I will I would spot you exactly where traffic just pop up everywhere yeah but that's not the fun part is it that's not the fun thing that's not that's not the Pokemon go away to flag and that's what I personally feel for me I don't need to get it out of nag which is a five-kilometer egg I need to quints identity just run into it like I see it on my nearby and I'm like oh that's where I'm going but I don't want to specifically go to location just because happen to be there it is to find a Pokemon in my Dax yeah and of course lies still need of course as the region exclusive sure sure yeah so that's interesting that you don't seek out Pokemon I I felt like that I was that way for a while but with Pokemon go fest leading up I started using maps like Silk Road or you know Jim hunter all these resources out there you know to pinpoint certain things you have a pretty hard stance on spoof errs and and I completely agree with you but where are you coming from with that with people that you know are in Europe trying to to America they get tauros or you know PD and Australia trying to get far like where where's your stance on that there are better games like the actual Pokemon games to play if you're gonna play pokemon go to spoof cuz if you think about it boku isn't a whole lot of fun if you're gonna spoof there's a better gym system in the actual Pokemon games you can PvP in Pokemon games you can catch every single Pokemon Pokemon games I don't see what's so fun like the whole idea behind Pokemon go and that is of course to interpret before it is for everybody it's everybody else it's different of course but what I feel based off what my community tells me is that Pokemon goes is seen as a game that you play on the go when you go outside and actually play it but if you are at home and you're gonna go you're you type in your coordinates and you snipe to that location and then you get that Pokemon there is no feeling of satisfaction from doing something like that so it's also it you also if you are going to spoof there's two other things that are also to be considered or three the first thing is that other players that are playing the game legitimately get annoyed by the fact that some of these players do show off on Twitter and they're like hey I caught this Pokemon yeah what is the point you didn't go out and get it and then they're also slowing down my antics resources because we're new auntie could use these manpower you could use this manpower to put that in development or making the game better but scoopers are doing is making sure that Niantic has to focus some of that energy and time into taking making sure that spoofs got taken now so it has like a very negative effect to it and i feel that as a waste because Niantic and pokemon go is not perfect there's so many things still that can be improved in the game and until pokemon goes to game which is still pretty much a project in development I feel that school first is just like making sure that this goes like down really slow especially like in the beginning with the server and stuff so that's why my stance on spoofing is so harsh because I feel there's no excuse for a spoofing and that stands got even harsher after meeting people in wheelchairs disabled people people are that are sick people after that of certain diseases that still enjoyed the game playing Pokemon go by going outside so it's like of course no but not everybody's gonna agree with that stance of mine but that's what I feel Pokemon goes all about and that's you know you just making enough fun for yourself I guess ya know I completely agree with you I with pretty much every Pokemon of my pokedex I remember catching like my first I remember doing my first raid which I think was like a bay leaf raid I remember you know catching lugia for the first time I remember finding a wild needle Queen for the first time at like 2:00 a.m. when I was at look at Denny's like I remember so many captures in Pokemon go that sometimes the main game doesn't make me feel that which is a little disheartening but you know if my friends in Hawaii and says oh I see a course he'll give me your login to me it's like what's the point like I don't get to experience that joy of finally seeing corsola for the first time yes exactly and I'm and just for the record I've never given anyone my login I'm definitely against movie huh yeah it's exactly what you said it's just that experience of going out and doing it I think there's a lot of value to that and you know maybe not everyone sees that value mm-hmm well I don't want to keep too much more of your time but I do want to end with with one one more question here so with as big as Pokemon go is and obviously it's like the biggest part of your life right now that that partnered with your YouTube career does that make you want to do more Pokemon stuff whether that's other iOS games and others Pokemon duel Magikarp jump there's the ultra Sun and ultra moon coming later this November you know there's the new movie coming out in November this is reigniting your love for pokemon wants you to expand and and get into the other parts of the franchise scallop itself question you're not taking up too much of my time no worries about that I don't know to be completely honest it's kind of a weird one a Magikarp jump I play I streamed it a couple of times it is too much of a kooky cookie clicker time game so I I do started up from time to time to kill some time if I'm waiting for if I'm waiting in the bus or something like that I open it up so that is kind of cool I guess uh and then sometimes I do play pokemon shuffle which I still very much enjoy the kids actually really great it really is like the moment I got the very first time I I was kind of hooked so those kind of games really keep my interest I try Pokemon do but it's really not my cup of tea because it's so it's so orangey it's so random so that that's not really my topic game but some people might you know fight me on that but it's just like I just don't like the the chance aspect of it there's too much chance I feel that that will be thrown at you with Pokemon too but one game in particular that I'm looking forward to a lot is Pokemon for the Nintendo switch and undoubtely whenever that gets released I will I think offer that on my youtube channel yeah but no it no interest in office ultramoon IIF I am interested in that I just feel that there are I feel a little bit intimidated if that makes any sense I feel a little bit intimidated by covering the main Pokemon games on my channel because there are channels out there which are so successful and so much more knowledgeable than I than I am in covering that game that I think it's better for me to stick to my roots seeing as that game I'm not exactly it's coming around the corner right it's getting there pretty soon and yeah it's just like I will play the game and I'll follow everything that's happening around the game but seeing as I feel how Sun and Moon themselves were pretty underwhelming I don't know if I want to really cover ultra so note I actually actually lied I do have one more question so sure you've been doing this for over a year now eventually we'll give up Pokemon go eventually we'll get gen 3 Gen 4 Jan will you you know knee antic said they want to do they want to do every generation yes do you feel that it's gonna be difficult to keep doing the content you are doing and I mean what I mean by that is do you think it'll ever get stale or to say me because adding more Pokemon to the game doesn't really change it undoubtely on that was oh yeah but like I guess like I guess to sum up that whole question the question would be how how are you gonna stay relevant with Pokemon go because it doesn't change that much you know for month to month yeah that's kind of a tough question to to answer I guess the best way to answer that question would be as long as I enjoy it myself and I'm able to provide content that I'm happy with that I'm proud of something that I've always been doing I don't think I'll have too much trouble and I guess staying relevant is not really the right word for it because I'm not looking to stay relevant or be relevant in any way shape or form like if if all the the the people that would like to get an autograph or self you would fall away but I will still have the capability of making videos hey I'm all for that so I'm not necessarily super looking to be or stay relevant but I just want to make videos that that I would personally enjoy and I still got so much more to do with Pokemon go that I don't think that the journey will be ending anytime soon there's still so many places to visit as well so we'll have to see about that it's gonna be interesting to see what my anti comes up with next but there has been instances which gave which gives me hope that Niantic will come up with something that's interesting and I mean if Pokemon girls not gonna be it then I'm pretty sure that in the near future there will be other AR gangs which will allow you to go outside which will which will make it equally as interesting as well
