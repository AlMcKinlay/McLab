also returned from lunch uh Welcome to (1:13 - 1:18)
the New Year welcome to 2023 I can't (1:16 - 1:21)
believe what a major change happened (1:18 - 1:24)
Saturday night at midnight the whole (1:21 - 1:27)
world is different who knew what the (1:24 - 1:30)
2023 would look like I am shocked oh (1:27 - 1:32)
yeah this will be the uh first episode (1:30 - 1:34)
of 2023 although we're recording what's (1:32 - 1:37)
on the 30th before the giveaway the (1:34 - 1:39)
inside baseball oh you know it's like (1:37 - 1:41)
that's my whole thing now that whole (1:39 - 1:44)
thing comes across as fake it's like all (1:41 - 1:46)
the Pokemon go events I'm sure it was (1:44 - 1:47)
good we're recording the day before we (1:46 - 1:51)
had the best time boy did we ring in the (1:47 - 1:53)
New Year (1:51 - 1:56)
all right we gotta drink the things we (1:53 - 1:57)
got three things to talk about today uh (1:56 - 1:59)
we haven't given Pokemon Masters any (1:57 - 2:02)
love uh and gotcha games usually do a (1:59 - 2:05)
big New Year's thing so uh we have that (2:02 - 2:07)
to talk about uh there was a poll in (2:05 - 2:09)
Japan with the top 30 Pokemon from (2:07 - 2:12)
scarlet and violet uh you won't believe (2:09 - 2:17)
who was number three I do (2:12 - 2:20)
uh and then the cinder race raids just (2:17 - 2:22)
happened or started to uh last night (2:20 - 2:25)
Thursday night although um they're going (2:22 - 2:27)
all weekend uh I guess we can start with (2:25 - 2:29)
the cinderace raids because uh I spent (2:27 - 2:32)
seven hours straight doing cinderace not (2:29 - 2:34)
that because I failed over and over just (2:32 - 2:37)
because I was like let's talk about your (2:34 - 2:39)
life choices to do them for seven hours (2:37 - 2:42)
straight I look Greg as somebody who sat (2:39 - 2:45)
you know before I was when I had a nine (2:42 - 2:47)
to five job I would get home and I would (2:45 - 2:49)
sit in Destiny and I would do King's (2:47 - 2:53)
fall of like four hours uh (2:49 - 2:57)
just to help people go through or you (2:53 - 2:59)
know the luck of the draw of we have (2:57 - 3:01)
this really bad person and you know we (2:59 - 3:02)
don't know if we should kick him out or (3:01 - 3:05)
not but they yeah (3:02 - 3:06)
kick and now you're doing it for your (3:05 - 3:09)
job yeah that's always okay to do it (3:06 - 3:11)
always kick the person to the curb if (3:09 - 3:13)
there's a problem person don't don't do (3:11 - 3:15)
them any favors what if they're really (3:13 - 3:17)
nice but bad no that's that's the yeah (3:15 - 3:19)
yeah you know I mean you know how many (3:17 - 3:21)
times my better judgment has saved you (3:19 - 3:23)
from being kicked out of Final Fantasy (3:21 - 3:25)
raids a lot (3:23 - 3:27)
what I was going to say last week as (3:25 - 3:29)
we're as we were preparing for the (3:27 - 3:31)
cinderace raids I mentioned last week (3:29 - 3:33)
that I was not a competitive player (3:31 - 3:36)
growing up I didn't have the time to (3:33 - 3:38)
learn that stuff and I could very very (3:36 - 3:40)
easily be one of the people bringing the (3:38 - 3:43)
azumaril to these raids if it wasn't for (3:40 - 3:46)
the people I know who are helping make (3:43 - 3:49)
things make resources like Steve that (3:46 - 3:51)
make these easier and make thinking (3:49 - 3:53)
about competitive easier (3:51 - 3:55)
I (3:53 - 3:57)
well tell you that by the time this came (3:55 - 3:59)
out I have probably done a cinderius (3:57 - 4:01)
raid have I done one yet no because I (3:59 - 4:05)
didn't get home yesterday until (4:01 - 4:08)
10 30 p.m and the thought of turning on (4:05 - 4:09)
my switch (4:08 - 4:12)
and like I was like no I just want to go (4:09 - 4:15)
to bed I spent yesterday evening doing (4:12 - 4:17)
them I did spend yesterday evening doing (4:15 - 4:20)
them and they are difficult I won maybe (4:17 - 4:23)
one in five I was doing them with random (4:20 - 4:26)
people though oh yeah oh boy well first (4:23 - 4:28)
day first day random anything like first (4:26 - 4:31)
day random dungeons are always like (4:28 - 4:33)
nobody knows what's going on (4:31 - 4:36)
well and then and then like three about (4:33 - 4:39)
six star raids because those are just as (4:36 - 4:41)
wild look we're not we can't we don't (4:39 - 4:42)
have time to talk about six hours right (4:41 - 4:43)
now (4:42 - 4:47)
but it by Saturday people will have (4:43 - 4:49)
learned right like first day is always (4:47 - 4:52)
bad and then usually by Saturday people (4:49 - 4:54)
have caught on to what they need to do (4:52 - 4:57)
or or they Hitler won and stopped (4:54 - 4:58)
playing and it's only the hardcore (4:57 - 5:00)
people left because they got advice from (4:58 - 5:03)
the wrong person yeah they're they're (5:00 - 5:05)
it's the it's the azumerable problem all (5:03 - 5:07)
over again right like a couple YouTubers (5:05 - 5:10)
made a Zuma rule really popular (5:07 - 5:14)
and uh you know this is why azumar was (5:10 - 5:16)
coming to every raid before and after (5:14 - 5:18)
Charizard because it was like well it (5:16 - 5:19)
worked here (5:18 - 5:20)
um (5:19 - 5:23)
my my (5:20 - 5:26)
fear of people being this this is my (5:23 - 5:30)
fear my fear was well azumerel worked (5:26 - 5:32)
for Charizard I don't see why it (5:30 - 5:35)
wouldn't work for cinderase I'm lazy I'm (5:32 - 5:38)
just going to use a zoomeral that that (5:35 - 5:41)
was a reality (5:38 - 5:44)
the uh well here's a couple let me say (5:41 - 5:45)
something good here (5:44 - 5:50)
I think that these raids are a fantastic (5:45 - 5:54)
way to get people to return to the game (5:50 - 5:57)
um and I know that like (5:54 - 6:01)
I I know that like things like twitch or (5:57 - 6:05)
Twitter or whatever are not a good gauge (6:01 - 6:06)
of (6:05 - 6:08)
um what is that (6:06 - 6:12)
uh like a player base right but (6:08 - 6:14)
when there is something exciting (6:12 - 6:17)
happening in like Pokemon go or whatever (6:14 - 6:21)
other insert game here when the when (6:17 - 6:24)
your viewer base just dramatically (6:21 - 6:26)
trickles up like when you double your (6:24 - 6:28)
viewers triple your viewers because of (6:26 - 6:30)
an event that's a good sign that the (6:28 - 6:32)
event is building excitement or people (6:30 - 6:34)
want to do it right or people are (6:32 - 6:37)
interested uh at least you know in in (6:34 - 6:40)
the the twitch space you know on launch (6:37 - 6:42)
day you have a lot of viewers and then (6:40 - 6:43)
you have the hardcore people that stick (6:42 - 6:45)
around and watch and then you have the (6:43 - 6:46)
people that like they play the game for (6:45 - 6:48)
two weeks and now they moved on to (6:46 - 6:50)
another game and that's totally cool not (6:48 - 6:53)
everyone plays Pokemon for three years (6:50 - 6:55)
straight until the next Pokemon game (6:53 - 6:57)
comes out (6:55 - 7:00)
uh but (6:57 - 7:03)
I had more people watching me play (7:00 - 7:05)
cinderace than on launch day (7:03 - 7:07)
and I and I think probably part of that (7:05 - 7:09)
was because I made guides and then (7:07 - 7:11)
people were like because a lot of people (7:09 - 7:12)
were I had so many people for the first (7:11 - 7:14)
time being like this is my first time in (7:12 - 7:15)
stream (7:14 - 7:17)
um also twitch tells you that it'll say (7:15 - 7:19)
like first time chatter uh and they're (7:17 - 7:21)
like they're like I used your guys that (7:19 - 7:24)
worked or I I've been listening to the (7:21 - 7:25)
podcast for years this is my first time (7:24 - 7:27)
watching your stream because I I wanted (7:25 - 7:29)
help with cinderace so that was (7:27 - 7:31)
fantastic (7:29 - 7:32)
um (7:31 - 7:33)
and it was really nice to see like (7:32 - 7:35)
people being like holy cow I couldn't do (7:33 - 7:37)
this before I got here and the people in (7:35 - 7:38)
your community were really great and (7:37 - 7:40)
really helpful (7:38 - 7:43)
um and that that is the same you know if (7:40 - 7:45)
I if I go outside of my own twitch (7:43 - 7:47)
Channel and I look at other people and (7:45 - 7:49)
and their numbers are really good and (7:47 - 7:51)
you know you look at the YouTube video (7:49 - 7:55)
stuff and like cinderase help video has (7:51 - 7:57)
more views than like everything else (7:55 - 7:59)
it's like people it it seems that the (7:57 - 8:02)
general consensus are these raids are (7:59 - 8:04)
exciting enough or challenging enough or (8:02 - 8:07)
the Pokemon choice is good enough where (8:04 - 8:09)
people want to come back even if they (8:07 - 8:11)
haven't played in the last (8:09 - 8:14)
hey two weeks it at least says because (8:11 - 8:17)
it's hard to it is hard to pull actual (8:14 - 8:19)
data right like it would be great if we (8:17 - 8:21)
actually got data from the book of my (8:19 - 8:25)
company about an uptick like we can (8:21 - 8:29)
guess that judging by (8:25 - 8:32)
an uptick of numbers that they saw an (8:29 - 8:34)
increase of (8:32 - 8:36)
players we don't know that for sure (8:34 - 8:39)
right like the difficulty about (8:36 - 8:42)
extrapolating out of a very limited (8:39 - 8:45)
data set where we're not accounting for (8:42 - 8:46)
confirmation bias and only looking at (8:45 - 8:49)
the positives to say for sure like this (8:46 - 8:51)
is a huge win for (8:49 - 8:53)
Pokemon (8:51 - 8:56)
but we can we can safely say it looks (8:53 - 8:57)
like this brought a lot of people back (8:56 - 9:00)
like I mean my experience has been that (8:57 - 9:03)
with sword and shield I I am not sure I (9:00 - 9:05)
participated in a single Raid event in (9:03 - 9:07)
sword and shield I like the shiny ones (9:05 - 9:10)
oh yep in any of them not the shiny ones (9:07 - 9:12)
not the legendary ones just none I (9:10 - 9:15)
didn't have time it was my end of (9:12 - 9:17)
college time beginning of post College (9:15 - 9:20)
time just didn't bother with it and at (9:17 - 9:22)
this point they are in these games again (9:20 - 9:24)
I am starting to accept that this is how (9:22 - 9:25)
they are doing rare Pokemon (9:24 - 9:27)
distributions at this point for the most (9:25 - 9:30)
part and so I am starting to get into (9:27 - 9:31)
them more (9:30 - 9:33)
and so as this keeps being a more (9:31 - 9:35)
important thing I think more people will (9:33 - 9:38)
keep showing up (9:35 - 9:38)
I think it's (9:38 - 9:41)
um (9:39 - 9:41)
I I guess I I had the same experience (9:41 - 9:46)
with like I'm gonna use this Destiny as (9:44 - 9:49)
an example uh like Destiny you could (9:46 - 9:51)
always tell uh throughout like the (9:49 - 9:54)
seasons again you know a lot of these (9:51 - 9:55)
companies don't share numbers or (9:54 - 9:58)
anything they're not I I don't think I (9:55 - 10:00)
don't think there's a lot of reason to (9:58 - 10:02)
right like it's not like Bungie's being (10:00 - 10:04)
like well you know August was a little (10:02 - 10:07)
slow but we rolled out the update and (10:04 - 10:08)
but you you could always get that (10:07 - 10:10)
feeling right you could always get that (10:08 - 10:11)
feeling by joining like Crucible and (10:10 - 10:13)
being like Oh my God it's taking forever (10:11 - 10:15)
to match with somebody and then if (10:13 - 10:16)
there's like a big weekend like iron (10:15 - 10:17)
Banner it's like okay you're getting (10:16 - 10:19)
matched instantly because like we have (10:17 - 10:22)
enough players to put people into cues (10:19 - 10:24)
um you know when Destiny would do like (10:22 - 10:26)
when their raids obviously way more (10:24 - 10:29)
complex would come out you could you (10:26 - 10:30)
could tell that the tower was just more (10:29 - 10:32)
lively (10:30 - 10:34)
um you could just literally look at your (10:32 - 10:35)
friend's list and be like well a week (10:34 - 10:37)
ago there was six people on this week (10:35 - 10:40)
there are 45 people on like like this (10:37 - 10:43)
event has brought back people (10:40 - 10:44)
um (10:43 - 10:46)
so like (10:44 - 10:48)
that I mean that's really cool like uh (10:46 - 10:52)
not everyone is into Shiny Pokemon right (10:48 - 10:54)
not everyone is incompetitive not (10:52 - 10:56)
everyone is into every event that every (10:54 - 10:58)
company does I don't know that these are (10:56 - 11:01)
the best events uh but people want (10:58 - 11:03)
Cinder Ace that's for sure like people (11:01 - 11:05)
want Charizard I'm sure when they (11:03 - 11:07)
eventually do Greninja people will want (11:05 - 11:09)
to do Greninja you know I don't know if (11:07 - 11:11)
they put a b drill in one of these raids (11:09 - 11:13)
if it's going to be as popular (11:11 - 11:17)
I mean I'm not I'm not overly thrilled (11:13 - 11:20)
of the only way to get X Pokemon is that (11:17 - 11:23)
it's in a super hard raid weekend like I (11:20 - 11:25)
don't I don't know that I'm 100 (11:23 - 11:28)
behind that philosophy if that's the (11:25 - 11:31)
only thing they do for three years (11:28 - 11:35)
I'm like is this really you could trade (11:31 - 11:37)
for it yeah after that you can trade (11:35 - 11:39)
with anybody who did that so they'll be (11:37 - 11:42)
out there but I mean (11:39 - 11:45)
get those eggs I don't I don't know if (11:42 - 11:48)
that is my ideal only distribution (11:45 - 11:50)
method right like (11:48 - 11:53)
I I I think they're fun for now but (11:50 - 11:56)
again (11:53 - 11:58)
the same thing happens in other online (11:56 - 12:01)
things if the same sort of content comes (11:58 - 12:04)
out it it gets diminishing returns (12:01 - 12:07)
people are like I don't I don't want to (12:04 - 12:09)
struggle on this one again I will wait (12:07 - 12:13)
for somebody to trade it to me so I I (12:09 - 12:15)
hope they shake up the formula up (12:13 - 12:18)
somewhat that is not always going to be (12:15 - 12:21)
a seven star raid that maybe they'll be (12:18 - 12:24)
a multi-weekend where it's you know (12:21 - 12:26)
they're like the Delhi bird thing where (12:24 - 12:29)
you know it's one to five and it's (12:26 - 12:32)
shaken up more than the only way to get (12:29 - 12:34)
this rare Pokemon is to do this (12:32 - 12:36)
incredibly difficult raid because I (12:34 - 12:41)
think that will a year in be like I I am (12:36 - 12:43)
worn out like it's kind of the same (12:41 - 12:45)
thing with the Pokemon go thing with (12:43 - 12:48)
raids it's like no I don't I I don't (12:45 - 12:50)
care anymore I don't care that this is (12:48 - 12:51)
the only way to get tracking on this (12:50 - 12:55)
weekend I do not want to do this anymore (12:51 - 12:57)
I mean in sword and shield they had what (12:55 - 12:59)
like three kind of raids they had like (12:57 - 13:02)
the increased shiny ones (12:59 - 13:04)
um which which were hit and miss because (13:02 - 13:05)
if it was like a hundred percent (13:04 - 13:07)
cramerant but two percent of them could (13:05 - 13:09)
be shiny it was like this is (13:07 - 13:12)
statistically harder than if it was like (13:09 - 13:14)
uh the the (13:12 - 13:17)
Wailord which is like in 50 of the raids (13:14 - 13:20)
but to uh like the math on that I was (13:17 - 13:22)
always like some of these are easier and (13:20 - 13:26)
harder or more more or less luck based I (13:22 - 13:27)
should say (13:26 - 13:28)
um so they did the shiny raids and sword (13:27 - 13:31)
and shield then they they did the the (13:28 - 13:34)
Zara Aura like raids where you couldn't (13:31 - 13:37)
catch zero Aura (13:34 - 13:39)
um but they also did that with zero Aura (13:37 - 13:41)
where if you stumbled upon the shinies (13:39 - 13:42)
era Aura which you could also not catch (13:41 - 13:44)
that that zero Aura would be more (13:42 - 13:45)
difficult (13:44 - 13:48)
um I would say zero Aura Mewtwo were (13:45 - 13:49)
kind of the similar (13:48 - 13:51)
thing and the last one they ended with (13:49 - 13:52)
was last year inspectrier which was (13:51 - 13:54)
again very similar (13:52 - 13:57)
um and then they did do the thing that (13:54 - 13:58)
Greg just suggested which was like we're (13:57 - 14:00)
putting all the starters in Rage and (13:58 - 14:02)
this is the first time you can catch (14:00 - 14:03)
them and whatever so they they did have (14:02 - 14:05)
like three different (14:03 - 14:08)
like systems I guess Deli bird and now (14:05 - 14:11)
these are or like the cinderacer like (14:08 - 14:12)
the two they've showed they haven't (14:11 - 14:14)
shown the shiny one yet right I'm I'm (14:12 - 14:17)
sure they will show I'm sure that will (14:14 - 14:20)
happen too like right I'm like (14:17 - 14:22)
I I I don't know though like we don't (14:20 - 14:23)
know the numbers like Greg says we don't (14:22 - 14:25)
know if if people did come back right in (14:23 - 14:27)
Sword but I think part of the reason (14:25 - 14:29)
maybe why people didn't come back is (14:27 - 14:30)
because those were so poorly advertised (14:29 - 14:33)
I don't think these are any yeah (14:30 - 14:35)
these aren't great advertisers the only (14:33 - 14:37)
reason they're working is because they (14:35 - 14:40)
started them right away right like the (14:37 - 14:41)
shiny stuff didn't start until after New (14:40 - 14:43)
Years of sword and shield and then it (14:41 - 14:44)
kind of went away for a bit and then it (14:43 - 14:46)
came back and then like some months we (14:44 - 14:48)
got it some months we didn't (14:46 - 14:50)
you know Janine working on the calendar (14:48 - 14:52)
over the Pokemon company you know she's (14:50 - 14:54)
not consistent she's not consistent but (14:52 - 14:56)
she loves everything on one weekend yeah (14:54 - 14:58)
it's hard to say (14:56 - 15:02)
also how much of how much of the (14:58 - 15:04)
influx are people who just finally got (15:02 - 15:07)
the game for Christmas like I would just (15:04 - 15:09)
love to see the actual numbers to see (15:07 - 15:12)
was it this event was it because it was (15:09 - 15:13)
the first event right after everybody (15:12 - 15:16)
got the game for Christmas that's true (15:13 - 15:18)
that could have been Christmas what what (15:16 - 15:21)
does that look like like I think it'll (15:18 - 15:23)
be more telling the second time Cinder (15:21 - 15:26)
race is up to see if it matched what it (15:23 - 15:29)
was like the second time for Charizard (15:26 - 15:31)
because Charizard was before the holiday (15:29 - 15:34)
gift giving thing happened yeah so I (15:31 - 15:36)
just the only reason why I want to see (15:34 - 15:38)
the numbers from the actual companies (15:36 - 15:40)
because I'm just (15:38 - 15:42)
fascinated by what the actual return (15:40 - 15:44)
rate is because you've got to imagine (15:42 - 15:46)
that it's pretty easy to put these up (15:44 - 15:48)
right like oh yeah they just sub (15:46 - 15:50)
something in and there's like a little (15:48 - 15:53)
effort for big return it's like as a (15:50 - 15:55)
Corporation Concept like that's a huge (15:53 - 15:58)
win to be like well just put one Pokemon (15:55 - 16:00)
in this existing thing and we get all (15:58 - 16:02)
these people back I'm curious what those (16:00 - 16:04)
numbers look like I'm curious what that (16:02 - 16:08)
actually does for them and I think (16:04 - 16:10)
overall even if (16:08 - 16:13)
it Peters out I think it's a net win for (16:10 - 16:16)
them I think it does keep a big enough (16:13 - 16:18)
segment (16:16 - 16:20)
interested that they'll have a lot of (16:18 - 16:24)
life out of it I'm just again as a (16:20 - 16:27)
player I get bored of the same thing (16:24 - 16:30)
pretty quickly now like if it's yeah I'm (16:27 - 16:32)
like (16:30 - 16:34)
I think of like (16:32 - 16:35)
um you know this is this is what I've (16:34 - 16:37)
always wanted in a Pokemon game I've (16:35 - 16:38)
always wanted (16:37 - 16:40)
a game that gave you a reason to return (16:38 - 16:43)
back not only for myself but for like (16:40 - 16:44)
other people right like (16:43 - 16:47)
you know going back to an MMO like a (16:44 - 16:50)
World of Warcraft or a final fantasy the (16:47 - 16:52)
reason why people stop playing it is (16:50 - 16:54)
because their community of friends (16:52 - 16:57)
stopped playing it right like if you log (16:54 - 16:58)
like when when (16:57 - 17:00)
you know I would log into Final Fantasy (16:58 - 17:02)
14 that was before Greg was playing (17:00 - 17:05)
there was you know 20 different people (17:02 - 17:06)
on my friends list that I would play (17:05 - 17:08)
with consistently and then after a (17:06 - 17:09)
couple months it was 18 people and then (17:08 - 17:12)
it was 15 people and then it you know (17:09 - 17:13)
sometimes people came back and then they (17:12 - 17:15)
fell off and then near the end of Final (17:13 - 17:17)
Fantasy 14 it was like literally like (17:15 - 17:18)
five people and then Greg started (17:17 - 17:20)
playing and it was like (17:18 - 17:23)
I I just fell off (17:20 - 17:24)
um (17:23 - 17:28)
and if a game doesn't have that you you (17:24 - 17:30)
get that Fallout faster so like having (17:28 - 17:35)
something to be having an event or (17:30 - 17:37)
events or updates to have people return (17:35 - 17:40)
back to like is like I think really (17:37 - 17:42)
healthy for any kind of game whether (17:40 - 17:44)
this is Pokemon or it's interesting (17:42 - 17:46)
because Final Fantasy like (17:44 - 17:50)
the uh director of the game because (17:46 - 17:51)
people were like (17:50 - 17:53)
you know the next patch doesn't come out (17:51 - 17:54)
for another (17:53 - 17:56)
I want to say it's another month right (17:54 - 17:58)
like they have another big great thing (17:56 - 18:01)
and he literally said in his address is (17:58 - 18:03)
like I know people (18:01 - 18:06)
uh are leaving the game because there's (18:03 - 18:09)
nothing new to do and he said and that's (18:06 - 18:12)
good please go do something else play (18:09 - 18:15)
other games like don't feel that you owe (18:12 - 18:16)
us (18:15 - 18:20)
your repeated time right now like come (18:16 - 18:22)
back and do the new contact he's like (18:20 - 18:24)
it's perfectly healthy and we expect you (18:22 - 18:26)
all to leave for a while because we (18:24 - 18:28)
don't have new content (18:26 - 18:31)
that's that's part of our business model (18:28 - 18:33)
like we understand this is how people (18:31 - 18:36)
play games so I think that's sort of a (18:33 - 18:39)
to me was a very refreshing take on a (18:36 - 18:41)
company being like we understand that (18:39 - 18:43)
while we are taking time to work on (18:41 - 18:45)
something you may leave and we hope to (18:43 - 18:47)
make something exciting (18:45 - 18:50)
to bring you back but it doesn't (18:47 - 18:54)
cause pure chaos for us to know that (18:50 - 18:56)
you've left for a while and that our (18:54 - 18:58)
numbers go down like it's part of the (18:56 - 19:01)
pattern of long lasting games (18:58 - 19:02)
sounds like they have a lot of (19:01 - 19:04)
confidence people will come back well (19:02 - 19:05)
they are (19:04 - 19:08)
they are very very good like everybody (19:05 - 19:10)
is very eager for the next step in this (19:08 - 19:12)
story so I don't think they have (19:10 - 19:13)
anything to worry about (19:12 - 19:15)
so the by the time this podcast comes up (19:13 - 19:17)
the uh first round of cinderus will be (19:15 - 19:18)
over (19:17 - 19:18)
um and then the second round of (19:18 - 19:20)
cinderius will come back January 13th (19:18 - 19:22)
through the 15th (19:20 - 19:25)
um so this is UTC time by the way we I (19:22 - 19:26)
think we said this last week but like (19:25 - 19:29)
it'll you know Thursday night on January (19:26 - 19:32)
13th at like 6 p.m central time uh (19:29 - 19:34)
Cinderella should come back uh cinderes (19:32 - 19:37)
had a I think the most shocking thing (19:34 - 19:39)
here is uh Senators only had five moves (19:37 - 19:42)
whereas Charizard had eight moves (19:39 - 19:44)
um cinderius has pyro ball (19:42 - 19:47)
who would have guessed that one what uh (19:44 - 19:51)
so it has it had a high jump kick (19:47 - 19:54)
um I I did say for weeks I suspected it (19:51 - 19:57)
to have Iron Head um and it did uh it (19:54 - 20:00)
had acrobatics and then it had high jump (19:57 - 20:02)
kick and bulk up (20:00 - 20:06)
and so I don't necessarily think eight (20:02 - 20:07)
moves (20:06 - 20:11)
is is like harder (20:07 - 20:14)
um you know is this is it I I didn't (20:11 - 20:16)
really pay attention to this before with (20:14 - 20:18)
Charizard but is it that it has a pool (20:16 - 20:20)
of five moves and you get a random four (20:18 - 20:23)
or does it have access to all five yeah (20:20 - 20:25)
so there are there are six star rates (20:23 - 20:29)
currently that have six moves okay (20:25 - 20:33)
attention enough to to notice yeah so (20:29 - 20:35)
there there are there are raids in the (20:33 - 20:37)
game six and five stars that have five (20:35 - 20:39)
to six moves I think there's one six (20:37 - 20:40)
star raid (20:39 - 20:44)
uh that has like three moves it's it's (20:40 - 20:45)
like uh (20:44 - 20:47)
that's a cloud side or something where (20:45 - 20:51)
it like it only has like three moves (20:47 - 20:53)
um so yeah it's not necessarily more (20:51 - 20:56)
moves makes it harder or easier I think (20:53 - 20:58)
with I I think that like sometimes when (20:56 - 21:01)
a gym leader has like two I think like (20:58 - 21:03)
Larry I think Larry has like two moves (21:01 - 21:05)
on one of his Pokemon yeah but (21:03 - 21:07)
um you know if the AI is programmed to (21:05 - 21:08)
be like (21:07 - 21:10)
sixty percent of the time use this move (21:08 - 21:11)
forty percent of the time to use this (21:10 - 21:13)
move or (21:11 - 21:15)
um it's much easier right like I think (21:13 - 21:16)
everyone's been in a wild Pokemon battle (21:15 - 21:18)
where they like (21:16 - 21:20)
use Spore and then the next turn they (21:18 - 21:21)
use Spore and then the next turn they (21:20 - 21:23)
use Spore and then it's like the AI is (21:21 - 21:24)
like (21:23 - 21:26)
you don't like if you were slightly (21:24 - 21:29)
smarter AI you would you would maybe do (21:26 - 21:31)
something a little bit different (21:29 - 21:33)
um and I think I think the thing that (21:31 - 21:35)
maybe threw people off I so some people (21:33 - 21:37)
you know every everyone's experience is (21:35 - 21:39)
going to be easy right like some people (21:37 - 21:40)
are like oh you know Cinder ice was (21:39 - 21:44)
easier oh uh Charizard was was easier (21:40 - 21:45)
um (21:44 - 21:47)
uh I don't think Charizard did anything (21:45 - 21:51)
to boost its stats uh I it had like (21:47 - 21:53)
sunny day (21:51 - 21:54)
um which by the time it put sunny day up (21:53 - 21:56)
it actually sunny day hurt it's (21:54 - 21:58)
hurricane which probably did the most (21:56 - 22:00)
damage to most people based off fairy (21:58 - 22:03)
type and fire type uh but cinderius has (22:00 - 22:05)
access to bulk up which is a really (22:03 - 22:06)
great move (22:05 - 22:08)
um (22:06 - 22:08)
Tarzan have Dragon Dance which one did I (22:08 - 22:12)
have Dragon Dance (22:11 - 22:16)
oh boy they're all blurring together uh (22:12 - 22:19)
no Dragon Dance on Charizard (22:16 - 22:20)
um (22:19 - 22:22)
so bulk up increases your physical (22:20 - 22:24)
Attack by One Stage and your physical (22:22 - 22:26)
defense by one stage (22:24 - 22:28)
um so there's ways around this like (22:26 - 22:30)
taunting (22:28 - 22:32)
um or (22:30 - 22:33)
uh (22:32 - 22:34)
uh well taunting would be the main way (22:33 - 22:38)
to stop that uh but like Charizard or (22:34 - 22:40)
like a lot of six star raid bosses uh (22:38 - 22:42)
cinderius goes first twice (22:40 - 22:43)
um Charizard did this as well Charizard (22:42 - 22:45)
would normally start with overheat do (22:43 - 22:48)
major damage to somebody who could take (22:45 - 22:50)
fire damage and then it would use its (22:48 - 22:53)
second turn to decrease or to clear its (22:50 - 22:55)
own stats (22:53 - 22:57)
um cinderius would like bulk up right (22:55 - 23:01)
away in acrobatics and uh pretty much do (22:57 - 23:04)
50 to 60 percent to most most Pokemon (23:01 - 23:06)
that were were getting brought to the (23:04 - 23:07)
raid (23:06 - 23:10)
um and then it would continue to bulk up (23:07 - 23:13)
so I I built Graphics they're still out (23:10 - 23:16)
there uh and I I relied on (23:13 - 23:18)
um chilling water (23:16 - 23:22)
would would decrease cinderace's (23:18 - 23:25)
physical attack stat uh so you know if (23:22 - 23:27)
it bulked up you chilling water you know (23:25 - 23:29)
it's plus one chilling water brings it (23:27 - 23:31)
to negative one it's back to zero (23:29 - 23:33)
so ideally you could have one person in (23:31 - 23:36)
the raid just Spam chilling water the (23:33 - 23:39)
entire time uh and it is so beneficial (23:36 - 23:41)
to the entire team (23:39 - 23:45)
that uh that's all they can do right and (23:41 - 23:46)
again this reminds me of like a final (23:45 - 23:49)
fantasy or a destiny where like you have (23:46 - 23:52)
one task this entire raid as long as you (23:49 - 23:54)
keep doing your task you help out (23:52 - 23:56)
everyone (23:54 - 23:58)
please I wish that people actually did (23:56 - 24:00)
it yeah (23:58 - 24:03)
um and then uh (24:00 - 24:05)
you know the other moves just you know (24:03 - 24:08)
do damage based on the bulk up the I (24:05 - 24:11)
think I think also people I I saw a (24:08 - 24:12)
couple times where people were using (24:11 - 24:15)
light screen uh which we saw in (24:12 - 24:17)
Charizard people were using reflect like (24:15 - 24:20)
just a misunderstanding of what these (24:17 - 24:21)
moves do (24:20 - 24:24)
um uh they're they're there were people (24:21 - 24:25)
that continued to bring physical Pokemon (24:24 - 24:29)
while I don't think surulage is like (24:25 - 24:32)
a bad Pokemon uh chilling water just (24:29 - 24:35)
decreases cinderius's physical attack it (24:32 - 24:37)
still gets that physical defense boost (24:35 - 24:39)
but it's very easy to ignore when you're (24:37 - 24:41)
using special attackers right you don't (24:39 - 24:42)
have to worry about that at all but I (24:41 - 24:45)
think I think that mechanic as simple as (24:42 - 24:47)
it is for probably people listening to (24:45 - 24:49)
the show because they're Pokemon fans (24:47 - 24:51)
um that mechanic (24:49 - 24:54)
through some people for a loop like why (24:51 - 24:56)
why is my Play Rough not doing that much (24:54 - 24:58)
damage well play rough is a physical (24:56 - 25:00)
type move and send races plus four (24:58 - 25:03)
physical defense right now like uh (25:00 - 25:06)
so I still stand by like the top three I (25:03 - 25:08)
tweeted this um you know uh would be (25:06 - 25:11)
would be slow bro (25:08 - 25:12)
um (25:11 - 25:15)
armor Rouge and pelipper I think I think (25:12 - 25:18)
those are really good choices (25:15 - 25:18)
um (25:18 - 25:22)
the the the the the random connecting I (25:19 - 25:25)
did do like two random with just randoms (25:22 - 25:27)
just to see how that was it was exactly (25:25 - 25:30)
how you expected it to be where (25:27 - 25:33)
one maybe May if you're lucky one of the (25:30 - 25:35)
randoms were really trying hard and it (25:33 - 25:37)
was very respectable and the other two (25:35 - 25:38)
were just like (25:37 - 25:40)
I'm gonna bring me ascarata and it's (25:38 - 25:43)
like I understand that you know your (25:40 - 25:44)
mascarato was your starter and it's (25:43 - 25:47)
probably your strongest but uh it's (25:44 - 25:49)
grass and that Pokemon in front of you (25:47 - 25:53)
still has uh a fire type move (25:49 - 25:56)
um I did maybe 15 to 20 (25:53 - 25:59)
uh of these with random people and (25:56 - 26:01)
almost every single one the majority of (25:59 - 26:02)
the people were bringing the Pokemon you (26:01 - 26:04)
recommended the problem is that everyone (26:02 - 26:07)
was looking out for themselves and not (26:04 - 26:10)
for the entire team but especially with (26:07 - 26:12)
Slowbro some advice got around to use (26:10 - 26:16)
iron defense yes that was the um that (26:12 - 26:19)
was the the uh very popular YouTubers (26:16 - 26:22)
and when they're currently doing that (26:19 - 26:24)
that's a problem (26:22 - 26:28)
yeah I I never really experienced that (26:24 - 26:31)
in like a final fantasy where well (26:28 - 26:34)
that's not true oh hold on let's let's (26:31 - 26:36)
back this up a little bit so it was it (26:34 - 26:38)
was always frustrating in Destiny where (26:36 - 26:42)
uh uh like people would people would put (26:38 - 26:43)
so much effort (26:42 - 26:46)
into like (26:43 - 26:48)
I'm for this example I'm gonna use (26:46 - 26:49)
cheesing it'll all come back around (26:48 - 26:51)
people would put so much effort into (26:49 - 26:54)
doing it like a a way that was not the (26:51 - 26:56)
way you were supposed to because quote (26:54 - 26:58)
unquote it was easier so a really good (26:56 - 27:01)
example of this was in um crota's end (26:58 - 27:03)
which was the second ever Destiny raid (27:01 - 27:06)
there was this bridge and you needed you (27:03 - 27:08)
needed two people to stand on platforms (27:06 - 27:09)
and then one person would cross the (27:08 - 27:11)
bridge there's six people in Destiny (27:09 - 27:13)
because otherwise the bridge would (27:11 - 27:16)
disappear and so you had six people on (27:13 - 27:17)
one side and there's enemies on both (27:16 - 27:20)
sides and you had to slowly move people (27:17 - 27:22)
over one at a time and then once enough (27:20 - 27:23)
people were on the other side they would (27:22 - 27:25)
they would activate the bridge and bring (27:23 - 27:26)
the rest of the people over so what it (27:25 - 27:28)
did is it ended up in a situation where (27:26 - 27:30)
five people were on one side one person (27:28 - 27:32)
was on the other so it was one person (27:30 - 27:34)
trying to fight off everyone and then (27:32 - 27:36)
eventually it was four and then two and (27:34 - 27:38)
then when you got to the end now the (27:36 - 27:40)
last person to go was in the (27:38 - 27:41)
disadvantage of like fighting off (27:40 - 27:43)
everyone as the rest of the team so it (27:41 - 27:45)
was like this you pretty much send your (27:43 - 27:47)
strongest person over first and then you (27:45 - 27:48)
send your strong your your other (27:47 - 27:50)
strongest person over last right you (27:48 - 27:52)
want like the weaker people to go in the (27:50 - 27:54)
middle so when they get over there they (27:52 - 27:55)
have health right it's a like I just (27:54 - 27:57)
explained the whole mechanic that's it (27:55 - 28:00)
that's the entire fight you you have two (27:57 - 28:02)
people step on a platform you move it (28:00 - 28:04)
over right like MO most raid mechanics (28:02 - 28:07)
at their core are very simple it's just (28:04 - 28:09)
like the execution of what you need to (28:07 - 28:12)
do on top of if one person dies it kind (28:09 - 28:14)
of makes the whole thing fall apart so (28:12 - 28:16)
like the most important part of a (28:14 - 28:17)
destiny raid (28:16 - 28:20)
is staying alive hey what's the most (28:17 - 28:22)
important part of these Pokemon raids (28:20 - 28:24)
also Staying Alive (28:22 - 28:27)
so what what people would do for crota's (28:24 - 28:29)
end instead of doing what I just (28:27 - 28:31)
explained which is very simple very (28:29 - 28:34)
simple stay alive stay on some platforms (28:31 - 28:35)
you know if you need help call for help (28:34 - 28:38)
they would they would climb on top of (28:35 - 28:41)
the unclimbable tower they would like (28:38 - 28:43)
glitch their way on top of the tower and (28:41 - 28:46)
they would spend sometimes up to 20 (28:43 - 28:48)
minutes they would be like hold on I've (28:46 - 28:50)
done this before with with my cousin Joe (28:48 - 28:52)
as soon as we get up this Tower it'll be (28:50 - 28:53)
okay and then so they climb up this (28:52 - 28:54)
Tower you're not supposed to climb up to (28:53 - 28:57)
and then they sit up there with a sniper (28:54 - 29:00)
rifle and then they slowly knock out the (28:57 - 29:01)
enemies on the other side until it (29:00 - 29:04)
triggers like this Fail-Safe so the (29:01 - 29:06)
bridge just goes up by default and and (29:04 - 29:09)
it was just like you have put so much (29:06 - 29:12)
effort into avoiding this mechanic (29:09 - 29:14)
because you couldn't you you didn't know (29:12 - 29:16)
how to do it right like like you've just (29:14 - 29:18)
and this would happen in a variety of (29:16 - 29:20)
Destiny raids where where people would (29:18 - 29:24)
be like hey my my second cousin's wife's (29:20 - 29:26)
sister's dog showed me this strategy (29:24 - 29:29)
just give me the next 45 minutes so I (29:26 - 29:31)
can like glitch over here so we can (29:29 - 29:33)
safely do this instead of just like (29:31 - 29:37)
learning mechanics (29:33 - 29:39)
um and again I don't know if I had that (29:37 - 29:42)
hardcore like memory and Final Fantasy (29:39 - 29:43)
where somebody was like hey let me just (29:42 - 29:46)
well what's funny is (29:43 - 29:50)
because of what used to happen is tanks (29:46 - 29:53)
would pull everything up to the to the (29:50 - 29:55)
boss so you they would pull (29:53 - 29:57)
four rooms of mobs and expect everybody (29:55 - 29:59)
to try to kill them all at the same time (29:57 - 30:03)
which would work for a high-end (29:59 - 30:06)
like if you had the max gear you could (30:03 - 30:07)
possibly do it (30:06 - 30:10)
they change now how they (30:07 - 30:12)
design dungeons that you can only go (30:10 - 30:14)
through two rooms and then there's a (30:12 - 30:16)
hard door and until you clear out those (30:14 - 30:19)
two rooms you can't go forward they had (30:16 - 30:21)
to they have physically changed how they (30:19 - 30:25)
design their content to stop people from (30:21 - 30:27)
doing these bizarre (30:25 - 30:30)
huge polls that would only work ten (30:27 - 30:32)
percent of the time the game divorce was (30:30 - 30:33)
like nope you don't get to do that (30:32 - 30:36)
anymore we're done there's a door now or (30:33 - 30:38)
a bridge that has to fall and it won't (30:36 - 30:40)
fall until everything's dead no more (30:38 - 30:43)
we're done uh but it's also the same (30:40 - 30:45)
thing where a Healer is like I'm just (30:43 - 30:47)
gonna DPS because we'll kill it faster (30:45 - 30:49)
it's like yeah but we also need to stay (30:47 - 30:52)
alive yeah so if you could heal no (30:49 - 30:53)
you're not gonna hit you're not going to (30:52 - 30:56)
clear the Doom counter over my head (30:53 - 30:58)
you're just that's not a I'm just gonna (30:56 - 31:00)
die in 10 seconds oh cool thanks so so (30:58 - 31:03)
so what Hannah said there's there's this (31:00 - 31:06)
there's there's uh this new Strat where (31:03 - 31:07)
um I actually I actually made this if if (31:06 - 31:09)
you go watch my YouTube video I I (31:07 - 31:12)
suggested a stored power bronzong build (31:09 - 31:13)
like two weeks ago I was like this is a (31:12 - 31:15)
possibility and I specifically said in (31:13 - 31:16)
the YouTube video like you know only do (31:15 - 31:18)
this with friends it's a little more (31:16 - 31:19)
complicated you know I wouldn't (31:18 - 31:21)
recommend this sprong zong out of the (31:19 - 31:23)
five other Pokemon I I recommended here (31:21 - 31:25)
I was like this is mostly for fun like (31:23 - 31:27)
if you've done some cinderaces maybe try (31:25 - 31:28)
this bronzong build it's like really fun (31:27 - 31:30)
and it'll work for you (31:28 - 31:32)
um and so (31:30 - 31:34)
um there's a Slowbro build going out (31:32 - 31:36)
around right now which is three iron (31:34 - 31:38)
defenses which does make it very hard (31:36 - 31:40)
for cinderes to kill you (31:38 - 31:41)
um and then three nasty plots and then (31:40 - 31:44)
using the move stored power and uh in (31:41 - 31:45)
that YouTube video I explained what (31:44 - 31:47)
store power does but store power is a (31:45 - 31:48)
psychic type move is base damage of 20. (31:47 - 31:50)
in relation to that you know a move like (31:48 - 31:53)
psychic is base damage 90. um but store (31:50 - 31:55)
Bauer every time you have a a status (31:53 - 31:58)
increase or a a stat increase it does 20 (31:55 - 32:01)
more damage right so like stored power (31:58 - 32:03)
ends up doing a lot you can boost that (32:01 - 32:05)
by like an attack cheer you can boost (32:03 - 32:07)
that with like a helping hand you can (32:05 - 32:08)
boost that being on Psychic terrain (32:07 - 32:10)
right there's like a lot of ways to (32:08 - 32:13)
boost that but it results in the Slowbro (32:10 - 32:17)
doing nothing for six turns and there's (32:13 - 32:19)
a high probability where cinderase can (32:17 - 32:21)
just go well your stats are cleared (32:19 - 32:26)
start over so uh (32:21 - 32:29)
so this like (32:26 - 32:30)
look somebody somebody could come into (32:29 - 32:33)
my my stream and they would be like (32:30 - 32:35)
hey bro uh you know I beat Cinder race (32:33 - 32:37)
with a feral Thorn I think for raw (32:35 - 32:38)
Thorn's really good and it's like yeah (32:37 - 32:41)
man I'm sure you know one for author's (32:38 - 32:42)
not in the game two I'm sure yeah you (32:41 - 32:44)
put bright powder on it and he missed (32:42 - 32:46)
like five pyro balls and you were able (32:44 - 32:48)
to defeat him no one is doubting that (32:46 - 32:51)
right like you could like any Pokemon (32:48 - 32:54)
realistically could work correct like (32:51 - 32:56)
you could use a Gardevoir you could use (32:54 - 32:58)
a Gyarados I'm sure you've beat the raid (32:56 - 33:00)
with those Pokemon right I'm sure you (32:58 - 33:02)
did there's just (33:00 - 33:05)
better better Pokemon or more consistent (33:02 - 33:07)
more reliable Pokemon that you can use I (33:05 - 33:10)
think Slowbro pelipper armor Rouge is (33:07 - 33:13)
one of them but (33:10 - 33:15)
I think my problem with the the stored (33:13 - 33:18)
power Slowbro is if the Slowbro was (33:15 - 33:20)
doing chilling water while it's not (33:18 - 33:22)
doing a lot of damage it is keeping (33:20 - 33:24)
everyone else alive and while iron (33:22 - 33:26)
defense is great for keeping you alive (33:24 - 33:28)
you're also not helping the team in any (33:26 - 33:32)
way at all you're just I'm you because (33:28 - 33:33)
once you're done with the three iron (33:32 - 33:35)
defenses you're switching over to nasty (33:33 - 33:37)
plot so there are six turns you are not (33:35 - 33:41)
cheering you are not healing you are not (33:37 - 33:44)
decreasing cinderaces special like uh (33:41 - 33:46)
physical attack stat (33:44 - 33:49)
um it's just like a very selfish way to (33:46 - 33:51)
play it reminds me a lot of Zoom role (33:49 - 33:53)
players right like when a zumro belly (33:51 - 33:54)
drums play roughs and then dies you know (33:53 - 33:56)
it's not sure if it hits it it's doing a (33:54 - 33:58)
lot of damage but like they're never (33:56 - 34:00)
cheering they're never healing (33:58 - 34:04)
themselves uh that like (34:00 - 34:04)
and I think there are two ways to play (34:04 - 34:08)
right there is your solo way (34:06 - 34:11)
which I think if you if you don't want (34:08 - 34:12)
to play with any friends totally valid (34:11 - 34:14)
if you don't want to you if you don't (34:12 - 34:15)
want to do online totally valid if you (34:14 - 34:17)
just want to play with the ntpcs I think (34:15 - 34:19)
you should do the Slowbro build I think (34:17 - 34:20)
you should do the three (34:19 - 34:24)
iron defenses the three nasty plots and (34:20 - 34:26)
and do that (34:24 - 34:28)
but it just it goes It goes back to (34:26 - 34:30)
remind me of the the bridge situation in (34:28 - 34:32)
crota's end where people will people (34:30 - 34:34)
will (34:32 - 34:37)
refuse to just learn mechanics (34:34 - 34:39)
to do it the easiest way ever and again (34:37 - 34:42)
like it's like I'll spend 20 minutes to (34:39 - 34:44)
climb this Tower I'm not supposed to (34:42 - 34:46)
climb in order to like do it easier like (34:44 - 34:48)
oh I'll spend six turns just hitting (34:46 - 34:50)
stat buttons and then hope that (34:48 - 34:52)
cinderace doesn't clear it and then I (34:50 - 34:53)
can hit the stored power button and then (34:52 - 34:56)
I'm done right like (34:53 - 35:01)
yeah I think interesting that we are (34:56 - 35:00)
seeing a huge change for the community (35:01 - 35:07)
without a lot of explanation right like (35:05 - 35:10)
you have a very solo game you have a (35:07 - 35:13)
game that tells you to just power (35:10 - 35:14)
through (35:13 - 35:16)
buff yourself like these are all the (35:14 - 35:19)
things that work in the PVE content and (35:16 - 35:22)
they're putting out (35:19 - 35:27)
raid bosses that don't use any of the (35:22 - 35:29)
skills that they taught you over 40 (35:27 - 35:31)
hours of the game right like you have to (35:29 - 35:33)
think about these things in a very (35:31 - 35:38)
different Community Way that just isn't (35:33 - 35:40)
in the game until you hit this content (35:38 - 35:44)
and it's fascinating to watch people (35:40 - 35:48)
struggle against that idea because it (35:44 - 35:50)
wasn't even in Sergeant Shield short and (35:48 - 35:53)
shield was turn based uh and so you you (35:50 - 35:56)
know you all stated your turn and this (35:53 - 35:57)
is such (35:56 - 36:02)
a radical change on how to play these (35:57 - 36:05)
games that doesn't even really exist in (36:02 - 36:07)
one to five star content like you could (36:05 - 36:09)
you can power through those not a (36:07 - 36:12)
problem and I think they have the (36:09 - 36:14)
company has done itself somewhat of a (36:12 - 36:18)
disservice by not really talking about (36:14 - 36:21)
how you need to interact with other (36:18 - 36:24)
people during these raids they've left (36:21 - 36:26)
it pretty much (36:24 - 36:27)
up to (36:26 - 36:30)
everybody else because like that article (36:27 - 36:34)
was okay but not great in the fact that (36:30 - 36:38)
it really didn't set the mindset other (36:34 - 36:41)
than the cheer section of you're there (36:38 - 36:43)
to to help everybody (36:41 - 36:46)
in the raid succeed and I think for (36:43 - 36:48)
people who've played a lot of MMOs who (36:46 - 36:50)
are play even like unite where you're (36:48 - 36:52)
sort of used to having to support your (36:50 - 36:53)
team (36:52 - 36:56)
that changeover is easier but I think (36:53 - 36:59)
for the general for a lot of the player (36:56 - 37:01)
base who have who maybe have never (36:59 - 37:04)
played those type of cooperation aspects (37:01 - 37:07)
of any game I think we are just going to (37:04 - 37:12)
see a big struggle and I worry that (37:07 - 37:14)
that is eventually going to be a turn (37:12 - 37:17)
off of these things because they really (37:14 - 37:18)
need to step up (37:17 - 37:22)
their communication I think around the (37:18 - 37:25)
community aspect of six and seven star (37:22 - 37:27)
rates more than they've done (37:25 - 37:30)
yes and I this is why I'm not blaming (37:27 - 37:32)
people about on it just after having (37:30 - 37:35)
done so many so many random raids last (37:32 - 37:36)
night (37:35 - 37:38)
um but the most (37:36 - 37:40)
frustrating read that I did was I went (37:38 - 37:42)
in there with my armor Rouge (37:40 - 37:45)
um and there were three other Slowbro (37:42 - 37:47)
and every single one of those three (37:45 - 37:48)
other Slowbro was just defending (37:47 - 37:52)
themselves for the first few turns there (37:48 - 37:55)
was no attacks hitting the cinderes at (37:52 - 37:58)
all I was getting pretty much knocked (37:55 - 38:00)
down to very low Health every turn and (37:58 - 38:03)
was focused on healing myself because (38:00 - 38:05)
none of them were taking any damage but (38:03 - 38:06)
I was gonna die and I was gonna lose the (38:05 - 38:08)
raid for all of us and that's what ended (38:06 - 38:09)
up happening happening because they were (38:08 - 38:12)
not focused on helping anyone other than (38:09 - 38:13)
themselves this is exactly the problem (38:12 - 38:16)
too this is like this is the it's not (38:13 - 38:18)
okay it's it's not even that azumerel is (38:16 - 38:20)
bad azumerel is a great Pokemon right (38:18 - 38:22)
like it does a lot of damage the problem (38:20 - 38:25)
it's it's literally the player who is (38:22 - 38:27)
playing azumerel is the problem it is (38:25 - 38:30)
these it is what Hannah just said if (38:27 - 38:32)
stored power (38:30 - 38:35)
there is no if if you do three iron (38:32 - 38:37)
defenses and three stored Powers you (38:35 - 38:40)
will do about 80 of cinderas's HP I've (38:37 - 38:42)
seen it happen I mean you could also do (38:40 - 38:43)
the same thing with armor Rouge which (38:42 - 38:45)
I've I've proven time and time again (38:43 - 38:47)
last night that like armor Rouge can do (38:45 - 38:50)
way more damage faster than slope it can (38:47 - 38:53)
like like there's no contest (38:50 - 38:55)
um but like (38:53 - 38:57)
three slow Bros do not need to be doing (38:55 - 38:58)
that (38:57 - 39:01)
that's the thing is like why are why are (38:58 - 39:04)
you guys all doing the same thing it (39:01 - 39:06)
goes back to zoomero you all don't need (39:04 - 39:09)
to belly drum play rough like it you (39:06 - 39:11)
just don't like only two maybe two of (39:09 - 39:13)
you need to do that like if literally (39:11 - 39:16)
one of those slow Bros stopped being (39:13 - 39:19)
selfish and just focused on hitting (39:16 - 39:22)
chilling water or defense cheer or heal (39:19 - 39:23)
I'm sure that raid would have went (39:22 - 39:26)
smoothly yeah I I also think (39:23 - 39:28)
the game is (39:26 - 39:30)
hampered by the lack of communication (39:28 - 39:33)
because everybody goes in there with (39:30 - 39:35)
their Pokemon and with their assigned (39:33 - 39:40)
way to play that and you can't say hey (39:35 - 39:42)
everybody we're all gonna if we all Iron (39:40 - 39:43)
defense we're not going to get it (39:42 - 39:45)
because there's no way to communicate (39:43 - 39:48)
that and then once you you're saying if (39:45 - 39:49)
you if I hit the d-pad there's no like (39:48 - 39:51)
please don't iron defense yeah (39:49 - 39:54)
but there's no time to do that but also (39:51 - 39:57)
you don't you can't (39:54 - 40:00)
stop the play style that you came in (39:57 - 40:03)
with right like there isn't yet a (40:00 - 40:08)
Pokemon raid knowledge of when to make (40:03 - 40:10)
appropriate choices like people who have (40:08 - 40:14)
rated in Final Fantasy 14 know (40:10 - 40:16)
when you see the cast bar you have to (40:14 - 40:18)
stop healing and everybody's aware that (40:16 - 40:20)
healers are going to run and so that you (40:18 - 40:22)
have to adjust your tactics for this (40:20 - 40:25)
window and we don't have that yet we (40:22 - 40:26)
don't have a community knowledge because (40:25 - 40:29)
they've just done not a great job of (40:26 - 40:31)
explaining what you need to do to (40:29 - 40:36)
succeed they they have butted it but (40:31 - 40:39)
they uh need to go further and I think I (40:36 - 40:42)
think if anything else what I would like (40:39 - 40:45)
to see more of from the content creators (40:42 - 40:48)
that make builds is is also things of (40:45 - 40:52)
like here's how you it here's how you (40:48 - 40:55)
read what's happening when there's no (40:52 - 40:56)
communication (40:55 - 40:59)
if people do this this is what you need (40:56 - 41:01)
to compensate for because people don't (40:59 - 41:03)
have a tribal knowledge and Pokemon of (41:01 - 41:07)
how to do a raid yet how to do a (41:03 - 41:09)
four-man something because even in (41:07 - 41:11)
Dynamax Adventures you could power (41:09 - 41:12)
through (41:11 - 41:16)
uh it was still turn based I I think one (41:12 - 41:18)
of the biggest issues that we are (41:16 - 41:19)
butting up against that causes these (41:18 - 41:21)
frustrations is (41:19 - 41:25)
people know my Slowbro is supposed to do (41:21 - 41:29)
this I can oh I only know how to do this (41:25 - 41:32)
I don't know how to adapt nobody (41:29 - 41:34)
explained to me how to adapt nobody's (41:32 - 41:37)
told me if if these five things are (41:34 - 41:40)
falling where do I go I I don't know (41:37 - 41:43)
that I was told I do six (41:40 - 41:46)
ball cups and then hit it and they'll (41:43 - 41:48)
win nobody explained what should happen (41:46 - 41:51)
if I have other people doing that what (41:48 - 41:54)
do I do now and I think that is I think (41:51 - 41:56)
that is going to be a struggle (41:54 - 41:59)
for a while until people get used to (41:56 - 42:02)
this new dynamic in Pokemon and I think (41:59 - 42:04)
that's why none of my builds will ever (42:02 - 42:06)
recommend those kind of strategies right (42:04 - 42:07)
you know when people are like why why (42:06 - 42:09)
aren't you recommending (42:07 - 42:11)
um (42:09 - 42:13)
or or (42:11 - 42:15)
uh somebody was like what about (42:13 - 42:18)
salamance salamance resists high jump (42:15 - 42:20)
kick it resists pyro ball and I was like (42:18 - 42:23)
yeah salamance does resist all of that (42:20 - 42:25)
but salamance is a selfish Pokemon (42:23 - 42:27)
there's nothing that salamance learns (42:25 - 42:28)
that benefits the other three members (42:27 - 42:30)
and if you look at my slow row build (42:28 - 42:32)
with like chilling water that benefits (42:30 - 42:35)
everyone on the team uh psychic terrain (42:32 - 42:36)
benefits all the other psychic Pokemon (42:35 - 42:38)
on the team it would it like literally (42:36 - 42:40)
would like a slow the Slowbro build I (42:38 - 42:41)
picked (42:40 - 42:44)
like decreases syndrice's attack it (42:41 - 42:46)
increases anyone using other psychic (42:44 - 42:48)
attacks it has possibility to damage (42:46 - 42:51)
chilling water can or sorry rain dance (42:48 - 42:53)
can make chilling water stronger so if (42:51 - 42:54)
you have two chilling Waters or you or (42:53 - 42:57)
like there's a non (42:54 - 43:00)
uh fire type whatever you know like the (42:57 - 43:02)
the damage is decreased paliper is the (43:00 - 43:04)
same way armor origin is the same way (43:02 - 43:07)
there was there was a an instance (43:04 - 43:11)
you know I I I ended up doing like 56 (43:07 - 43:13)
raids last night and I think I only lost (43:11 - 43:15)
like seven of them (43:13 - 43:19)
um uh and and most of the time I was (43:15 - 43:22)
slow bro and I was I was chilling water (43:19 - 43:26)
and I was healing and I I every every (43:22 - 43:29)
single turn turn one I I set psychic (43:26 - 43:31)
train and then I I normally healed after (43:29 - 43:33)
that because obviously Center is those (43:31 - 43:35)
two moves and does bunch of damage so (43:33 - 43:37)
psychic train heal chilling water heal (43:35 - 43:40)
and (43:37 - 43:42)
there was only one time when I played (43:40 - 43:44)
Slowbro the way I played it that we lost (43:42 - 43:47)
and somebody came in and they they (43:44 - 43:49)
didn't say anything in chat totally cool (43:47 - 43:52)
right no big deal and they were armor (43:49 - 43:54)
Rouge and they they started off and they (43:52 - 43:56)
hit expanding force and then they hit (43:54 - 43:57)
expanding force and then they hit (43:56 - 43:59)
expanding four and that's all I did (43:57 - 44:00)
right they just like they just hit (43:59 - 44:02)
expanding force their name was Jonathan (44:00 - 44:05)
and I was like oh call out now and I was (44:02 - 44:08)
like Jonathan I know you're in my twitch (44:05 - 44:10)
stream right now that's the only way you (44:08 - 44:12)
joined I was like we are going to lose (44:10 - 44:15)
this raid like we have we have like you (44:12 - 44:16)
know how like the health bar the health (44:15 - 44:18)
bar is like 50 right Shield is up health (44:16 - 44:21)
bar is 50 our little timer bar is at (44:18 - 44:23)
like 20 percent (44:21 - 44:25)
I was like Jonathan if you can hear me (44:23 - 44:27)
right now and you're using the armor (44:25 - 44:29)
Rouge I recommended because I don't know (44:27 - 44:32)
how else you got here I was like hit at (44:29 - 44:33)
it like if you have acid spray hit it (44:32 - 44:36)
like you're not the hero you are trying (44:33 - 44:38)
to be with just spamming expanding force (44:36 - 44:41)
and then all of a sudden (44:38 - 44:43)
armor Rouge these acid spray and like my (44:41 - 44:45)
twitch chat lost their mind they're like (44:43 - 44:47)
oh my gosh Jonathan and I was like all (44:45 - 44:49)
right Jonathan listen to me let's okay (44:47 - 44:51)
Jonathan I need you to ask the spirit (44:49 - 44:53)
again and all of a sudden armor Rouge (44:51 - 44:55)
acid spray and I was like holy cow (44:53 - 44:57)
Jonathan we're gonna win this I believe (44:55 - 44:59)
in you I need you to acid spray one more (44:57 - 45:01)
time Jonathan and then it was like acid (44:59 - 45:03)
spray and I was like holy cow I was like (45:01 - 45:05)
Jonathan all you have to do now is hit (45:03 - 45:07)
expanding Force you just gotta hit that (45:05 - 45:09)
button and we win and then it was like (45:07 - 45:11)
Cinder Ace is cleared its own stats and (45:09 - 45:13)
uh (45:11 - 45:16)
we were close we were close like like (45:13 - 45:19)
it's also you you make the tools right (45:16 - 45:22)
and and sometimes people just still (45:19 - 45:24)
don't know how to use that right like (45:22 - 45:28)
like that acid spray is so good like (45:24 - 45:31)
chilling water is so good and it helps (45:28 - 45:32)
everyone (45:31 - 45:34)
um so you know I'll continue to make (45:32 - 45:36)
graphics I'll continue to recommend (45:34 - 45:39)
Pokemon that would help that's why I (45:36 - 45:40)
recommend a grip style for Charizard (45:39 - 45:42)
right like if you were joining random (45:40 - 45:45)
raids and everyone is a zoomeruling you (45:42 - 45:47)
can at least reflect you can you can (45:45 - 45:50)
Spirit like you can help keep those (45:47 - 45:53)
alive Slowbro using iron defense (45:50 - 45:56)
he he ain't keeping anyone alive (45:53 - 46:00)
I think people really honestly need to (45:56 - 46:02)
understand (46:00 - 46:05)
that the raids (46:02 - 46:09)
are a cooperative (46:05 - 46:11)
they need a tutorial for the raids as (46:09 - 46:13)
good as their original tutorials for (46:11 - 46:14)
catching Pokemon in the beginning of (46:13 - 46:16)
each game they need they need something (46:14 - 46:20)
as hand holdy as that (46:16 - 46:23)
it is it is (46:20 - 46:25)
you know there's a reason why everybody (46:23 - 46:29)
by the most played class in any MMOs is (46:25 - 46:32)
the damage dealing class right like (46:29 - 46:35)
they're easier to play the choices are (46:32 - 46:38)
simple you get to do big numbers (46:35 - 46:41)
and it's fun there's a reason why nobody (46:38 - 46:44)
likes to tank and nobody likes to heal (46:41 - 46:46)
because they're the most (46:44 - 46:50)
important job sometimes but they're the (46:46 - 46:53)
most stressful jobs a lot of the time (46:50 - 46:57)
and you don't necessarily get to see the (46:53 - 47:01)
big the big things happen right like you (46:57 - 47:05)
you have to be a person that enjoys (47:01 - 47:08)
supporting other people and that is (47:05 - 47:09)
and (47:08 - 47:11)
you have to be a person that enjoys (47:09 - 47:15)
making more complex decisions like I (47:11 - 47:18)
love tanking I don't like healing mainly (47:15 - 47:21)
because I have difficulty just keeping (47:18 - 47:24)
track of Everybody's Health and where (47:21 - 47:26)
I'm supposed to be on the ground like I (47:24 - 47:28)
I can't slip my focus (47:26 - 47:32)
that much but I love being dancer which (47:28 - 47:35)
does damage and does support moves right (47:32 - 47:39)
like I love the combo thing so I think (47:35 - 47:41)
there's just you know we're gonna run (47:39 - 47:43)
into a lot of people who like being (47:41 - 47:46)
damaged dealers I mean that is Pokemon (47:43 - 47:50)
and I think we really are going to I'm (47:46 - 47:53)
curious to see if the community can (47:50 - 47:55)
switch to a (47:53 - 47:57)
some of us are tanks some of us are (47:55 - 48:00)
supporters not everybody can be dealer's (47:57 - 48:02)
mindset or if they will just walk away (48:00 - 48:05)
from these types of raids (48:02 - 48:06)
I mean a lot of the times last Point (48:05 - 48:08)
here a lot of times is you only really (48:06 - 48:10)
need one damage dealer like going back (48:08 - 48:12)
to the Slowbro thing if if the Slowbro (48:10 - 48:14)
wants to do stored power (48:12 - 48:15)
then you need three other people to (48:14 - 48:18)
support that where you don't need three (48:15 - 48:20)
people to all try to do the same thing (48:18 - 48:23)
when the result is (48:20 - 48:25)
well that this was designed for just one (48:23 - 48:28)
Pokemon to do it (48:25 - 48:31)
um like like three slowbros one armor (48:28 - 48:34)
Rouge or or or one pellet per two (48:31 - 48:36)
slowbros one armor Rouge like I don't (48:34 - 48:37)
think that combination for me ever (48:36 - 48:39)
failed at all like it it's just because (48:37 - 48:42)
the armor just the armor Rouge is the (48:39 - 48:44)
one doing the most damage the slowbros (48:42 - 48:46)
are are knitting (48:44 - 48:48)
um reducing (48:46 - 48:51)
cinderace's attack as is the pelipper (48:48 - 48:53)
and there's a three different Pokemon (48:51 - 48:55)
that can heal and keep the armor Rouge (48:53 - 48:57)
alive and like (48:55 - 48:59)
there there's just a (48:57 - 49:01)
and for me when I went in to do all the (48:59 - 49:02)
raids with the randoms and I built an (49:01 - 49:04)
armor Rouge that was the one of the (49:02 - 49:06)
three that I built I ended up being (49:04 - 49:08)
defense all the time because nobody else (49:06 - 49:10)
was doing it which is really swapped out (49:08 - 49:13)
not your job or clear smog because (49:10 - 49:15)
nobody else was doing anything that (49:13 - 49:18)
would help it deal less damage yep yeah (49:15 - 49:20)
right and like like I you know I never (49:18 - 49:22)
never had to taunt never had to clear (49:20 - 49:25)
smog because chilling water just was so (49:22 - 49:28)
great to cancel that it was just a good (49:25 - 49:31)
move to press (49:28 - 49:31)
um it's it's it's the same frustrate (49:32 - 49:37)
like I said it's the same frustration I (49:35 - 49:39)
have with Destiny or any other raid (49:37 - 49:41)
games obviously (49:39 - 49:42)
um you know somebody's probably gonna (49:41 - 49:44)
write on the YouTube of like well I'm (49:42 - 49:47)
Destiny's much more complex of a game (49:44 - 49:49)
the at the at the end of the sure but (49:47 - 49:52)
that's what an analogy is also like what (49:49 - 49:54)
what do you need to do in this Dusty (49:52 - 49:55)
raid you need six people to cross a (49:54 - 49:56)
bridge (49:55 - 49:59)
well I mean it they are I I will never (49:56 - 50:01)
say that (49:59 - 50:03)
Final Fantasy 14 dungeons aren't more (50:01 - 50:06)
complex and you have to be more aware (50:03 - 50:07)
but also (50:06 - 50:10)
the things you do in those games are (50:07 - 50:12)
also more complex and so (50:10 - 50:15)
it takes a very special person to be an (50:12 - 50:18)
excellent DPS an excellent tank and an (50:15 - 50:19)
excellent (50:18 - 50:21)
healer like that is a very specific (50:19 - 50:23)
person that can swap between all those (50:21 - 50:26)
jobs flawlessly we are not asking for (50:23 - 50:28)
you to do that much we are asking for (50:26 - 50:30)
you to Simply understand you need to be (50:28 - 50:32)
one of those other roles and we can (50:30 - 50:35)
point to more complex reasons that have (50:32 - 50:38)
very concrete things to show wide that (50:35 - 50:40)
cop why that combo Works a tank 2 DPS (50:38 - 50:45)
and healers are an excellent combo for a (50:40 - 50:47)
reason like yeah but you have specific (50:45 - 50:49)
roles and you know specifically what (50:47 - 50:51)
you're supposed to do (50:49 - 50:54)
yeah can like there are dungeons you I (50:51 - 50:56)
you can do like Palace of the Dead is a (50:54 - 50:58)
thing where you can do with four healers (50:56 - 51:00)
sure can do you know how long that takes (50:58 - 51:04)
yeah it takes forever it just because (51:00 - 51:06)
it's possible (51:04 - 51:09)
doesn't mean it's optimal (51:06 - 51:13)
yeah and again like if I saw an armor (51:09 - 51:14)
Rouge (51:13 - 51:16)
I would I would want to make sure I (51:14 - 51:18)
understand or should understand or you (51:16 - 51:20)
should understand that that armor Rouge (51:18 - 51:22)
is is the main damage dealer so at the (51:20 - 51:24)
anytime the armor has to stop to heal (51:22 - 51:26)
itself that is less damage that it's (51:24 - 51:29)
doing whereas like if I see a grim snarl (51:26 - 51:30)
I think (51:29 - 51:33)
well well I hope that grim star is going (51:30 - 51:35)
to be setting reflect he's going to be (51:33 - 51:37)
healing he's going to be faked like he's (51:35 - 51:39)
going to be support (51:37 - 51:40)
um (51:39 - 51:43)
and so like (51:40 - 51:43)
that's another thing you have to learn (51:44 - 51:47)
I'm like oh this Pokemon is doing this (51:45 - 51:49)
yeah anyways uh too long on this uh I (51:47 - 51:51)
like the center ice raids a lot uh and (51:49 - 51:54)
when they come back if you need help and (51:51 - 51:56)
you want to play with other people I'll (51:54 - 51:58)
be doing the same thing I I like helping (51:56 - 52:01)
people get that thing done just like I (51:58 - 52:04)
helped I don't know why but I I had an (52:01 - 52:06)
exception obsession with helping people (52:04 - 52:10)
clear Destiny raids for the first time (52:06 - 52:10)
um Pokemon Masters ex yeah (52:10 - 52:18)
uh there's an update (52:15 - 52:18)
um on Christmas (52:18 - 52:23)
you can now change your main character's (52:20 - 52:25)
appearance new hair colors for the main (52:23 - 52:26)
character has been added you can now (52:25 - 52:28)
change the style of main character's (52:26 - 52:31)
hair and hat some hats cannot be worked (52:28 - 52:33)
with some hairstyles (52:31 - 52:36)
um uh it's not as deep as you are all (52:33 - 52:39)
probably thinking the hats are full (52:36 - 52:41)
cover up your head or a sudden visor and (52:39 - 52:43)
generally you go with the sun visor if (52:41 - 52:44)
you're going to change your hair because (52:43 - 52:46)
it's the only way you can see your hair (52:44 - 52:49)
uh but you do have the option and I (52:46 - 52:50)
support this for everybody to either (52:49 - 52:53)
have bangs or no bangs (52:50 - 52:55)
choose your bang (52:53 - 52:56)
Style (52:55 - 52:59)
generally bangs are bad but you might (52:56 - 53:01)
like how bangs look with your particular (52:59 - 53:04)
hairstyle uh but yeah I think people are (53:01 - 53:06)
expecting like I can change my eyes and (53:04 - 53:08)
I can just no it's it is literally your (53:06 - 53:10)
hair and you get two choices of hat you (53:08 - 53:13)
can change the eye color there is that (53:10 - 53:16)
uh they added Dawn to the dating (53:13 - 53:19)
simulator part of the game they did uh (53:16 - 53:23)
there's also a holiday season gem (53:19 - 53:25)
special so this is going until January (53:23 - 53:29)
10th you'll be able to get reduced gems (53:25 - 53:32)
at a uh reduced you you need gems at a (53:29 - 53:34)
reduced price (53:32 - 53:36)
I think the prices are pretty okay yeah (53:34 - 53:38)
before I gotcha game four I gotcha game (53:36 - 53:40)
I think these are Pokemon gotcha game I (53:38 - 53:42)
think these prices are very good if you (53:40 - 53:44)
are considering I'm not I'm not (53:42 - 53:45)
suggesting it but if you like to spend (53:44 - 53:48)
money I do think that this is probably (53:45 - 53:49)
the best deal in a while that they've (53:48 - 53:50)
done (53:49 - 53:52)
uh four gotcha there's also like a (53:50 - 53:55)
contest uh where you can like earn you (53:52 - 53:57)
can like win like 60 000. yeah they got (53:55 - 53:59)
a bunch of New Year's contests going on (53:57 - 54:01)
um the biggest thing they did and I want (53:59 - 54:05)
to let people know is they added in the (54:01 - 54:08)
feature where you can see (54:05 - 54:12)
teams people used successfully to defeat (54:08 - 54:14)
content so there's a big thing of the (54:12 - 54:18)
legendary battles and you can now go in (54:14 - 54:20)
look at what somebody used for their (54:18 - 54:24)
team to beat that content copy that team (54:20 - 54:26)
if you have them and then attempt that (54:24 - 54:29)
content on your own so this is an (54:26 - 54:32)
example of a company putting a feature (54:29 - 54:34)
that had always existed outside of their (54:32 - 54:36)
game and was the was a huge subject of (54:34 - 54:38)
YouTube videos and just putting it in (54:36 - 54:40)
their game simply (54:38 - 54:43)
watch somebody else do it an in-game hit (54:40 - 54:45)
the button take their team and try it (54:43 - 54:46)
yourself (54:45 - 54:49)
a brilliant addition it makes me (54:46 - 54:51)
actually want to try some of the harder (54:49 - 54:53)
content because I know oh I don't (54:51 - 54:55)
actually have to go outside and do a (54:53 - 54:57)
bunch of useless research I can actually (54:55 - 54:59)
look in game and see what people were (54:57 - 54:59)
doing (54:59 - 55:02)
and if I have those cool I'll try it (54:59 - 55:04)
also you get to see even if you don't (55:02 - 55:05)
want to do it you get to watch somebody (55:04 - 55:07)
else do this content which is cool you (55:05 - 55:09)
get to see what happens and what the (55:07 - 55:11)
battle looks like so you like see the (55:09 - 55:12)
whole battle Yeah you can watch the (55:11 - 55:14)
whole battle you see what buttons they (55:12 - 55:15)
press (55:14 - 55:18)
um I think you because it does I haven't (55:15 - 55:19)
watched a I haven't watched a full one (55:18 - 55:21)
yet I sort of like just looked in and (55:19 - 55:23)
posited I like the steam I'll get back (55:21 - 55:25)
to it but generally over on the side now (55:23 - 55:27)
because they change the display it lists (55:25 - 55:29)
the moves as they come up oh okay okay (55:27 - 55:32)
and they added so they added (55:29 - 55:34)
it says the move and it says whether (55:32 - 55:36)
it's special or physical but then it (55:34 - 55:38)
will show like the order so you also (55:36 - 55:39)
kind of see what the turn order for (55:38 - 55:41)
Speed is (55:39 - 55:43)
um really a good (55:41 - 55:46)
uh (55:43 - 55:48)
a really good way to add this in because (55:46 - 55:51)
it's not for everything but there's a (55:48 - 55:53)
lot uh (55:51 - 55:55)
they the replay things (55:53 - 55:57)
has a bug in it right now that they have (55:55 - 56:00)
admitted that sometimes when you want to (55:57 - 56:01)
replay it just doesn't (56:00 - 56:03)
it just doesn't go so they're working (56:01 - 56:06)
that out but they're they are adding in (56:03 - 56:08)
so you can watch a lot of them and see (56:06 - 56:11)
how it went and then copy it um (56:08 - 56:13)
the only thing that you're probably not (56:11 - 56:15)
going to get is what their sync grid (56:13 - 56:19)
build was that they use because that's (56:15 - 56:21)
you can build thinkers out a bunch of (56:19 - 56:25)
different ways but this Edition (56:21 - 56:25)
I think is probably the biggest and best (56:25 - 56:30)
change they've made to that game in a (56:28 - 56:33)
while it just really is a way to say to (56:30 - 56:36)
your community we want to help you do (56:33 - 56:39)
our harder content and this is one of (56:36 - 56:42)
the ways we're doing it and I as much as (56:39 - 56:46)
I give Masters uh the Raz for being a (56:42 - 56:48)
dating simulator now because it kinda is (56:46 - 56:49)
they had it done into the dating Sim (56:48 - 56:52)
things like this really I think show (56:49 - 56:54)
that they are committed to making a (56:52 - 56:57)
better game and I I think I want to just (56:54 - 56:59)
applaud them for this because it's a big (56:57 - 57:02)
is a big thing (56:59 - 57:02)
story content too because I have a bunch (57:02 - 57:07)
of sync pairs I go in and I log in and I (57:05 - 57:11)
get the uh three things and I get sync (57:07 - 57:12)
pairs but I've never actually (57:11 - 57:14)
accomplished anything in that game yeah (57:12 - 57:17)
well yeah sounds like Masters yeah some (57:14 - 57:19)
of it like the storyline stuff is (57:17 - 57:22)
generally I don't think they put it for (57:19 - 57:23)
the normal because you can just (57:22 - 57:26)
overpower the normal like it normal (57:23 - 57:28)
stuff has set at a really low level (57:26 - 57:30)
um but for the higher harder content I (57:28 - 57:31)
know it's it's there for like the (57:30 - 57:33)
legendary (57:31 - 57:34)
uh (57:33 - 57:36)
uh for the legendary rates I know it's (57:34 - 57:38)
there for the champion Stadium I think (57:36 - 57:41)
you have to have done the normal on your (57:38 - 57:44)
own to unlock Master mode and then it's (57:41 - 57:47)
in master mode but again the normal the (57:44 - 57:49)
normal difficulties if you've got three (57:47 - 57:52)
maxed pairs that match the (57:49 - 57:54)
uh weaknesses you'll get through it just (57:52 - 57:56)
fine cool (57:54 - 57:58)
uh for the gem stuff you just have to (57:56 - 58:01)
log in during this period so just log in (57:58 - 58:03)
before January 7th and then uh they're (58:01 - 58:07)

pulling this from Nintendo life but uh I (59:28 - 59:32)
mean a bunch of people ran articles (59:31 - 59:35)
about this uh there was a Japanese poll (59:32 - 59:38)
uh which uh asked people what their (59:35 - 59:40)
favorite Pokemon were from my (59:38 - 59:43)
understanding the poll was uh uh they (59:40 - 59:47)
asked s 117 000 people uh those people (59:43 - 59:50)
could only vote for one Pokemon (59:47 - 59:54)
um and uh we have the poll this is uh (59:50 - 59:58)
not an official Pokemon one from my (59:54 - 60:00)
understanding it was done through (59:58 - 60:03)
gamewith.jp (60:00 - 60:03)
but hey uh uh 117 000 people is a lot of (60:04 - 60:13)
people that's a lot of people uh so (60:09 - 60:15)
uh (60:13 - 60:20)
our number one to No Surprise uh (60:15 - 60:22)
uh oh and that was trainers around Japan (60:20 - 60:24)
they were asked between the 16th and the (60:22 - 60:27)
23rd of December for the record uh (60:24 - 60:28)
number one with no surprise was (60:27 - 60:30)
tinkerton (60:28 - 60:35)
uh followed by Claude sire (60:30 - 60:40)
uh and then number three uh we heard for (60:35 - 60:43)
years months that people wanted cats to (60:40 - 60:45)
stay on four legs but the votes say (60:43 - 60:48)
differently two-legged cat meowskarada (60:45 - 60:50)
in third place people still wanted on (60:48 - 60:52)
poor legs (60:50 - 60:54)
clearly clearly didn't ruin the design (60:52 - 60:56)
though it was (60:54 - 60:58)
number three (60:56 - 61:00)
uh Fuego number four surreal Edge number (60:58 - 61:03)
five tassaguri number six sylviana seven (61:00 - 61:06)
now you're about like what Sylveon they (61:03 - 61:09)
pulled all 400 Pokemon in the game so (61:06 - 61:16)
Sylveon being the number one not gen 9 (61:09 - 61:17)
Pokemon (61:16 - 61:21)
slithering number eight that's the (61:17 - 61:23)
prehistoric Volcarona which a very good (61:21 - 61:25)
choice honestly Lucario number nine (61:23 - 61:27)
Gardevoir and mimikyu tied for number (61:25 - 61:30)
10. so far I mean with with the old (61:27 - 61:32)
Pokemon there are like literally no (61:30 - 61:34)
surprises there's no surprises uh (61:32 - 61:36)
Corydon number 12. that's actually (61:34 - 61:37)
interesting we'll get back to that (61:36 - 61:42)
Gengar 13 sprigatito 14 palmat 15. I (61:37 - 61:44)
don't understand this pick (61:42 - 61:48)
Umbreon 16 Mouse hold 17 me ride on 18 (61:44 - 61:52)
Palm me 19. (61:48 - 61:55)
Glaceon 20. Dragon Paul 21 no surprises (61:52 - 61:56)
there Drake Paul was incredibly popular (61:55 - 62:00)
Garchomp hard Dragon Volcarona Charizard (61:56 - 62:05)
luxury number 27 iron Valiant 28 EV 29 (62:00 - 62:08)
skelar Ridge Quagsire Pikachu quack (62:05 - 62:09)
quaval (62:08 - 62:13)
uh ditto number 34 snom Fido Arcanine (62:09 - 62:16)
Arcanine also always very popular (62:13 - 62:20)
um 37 glamora yeah I guess (62:16 - 62:24)
um 38 flutter Maine 39 scream tale 40 (62:20 - 62:28)
Leafeon 41 azumerole to be fair as (62:24 - 62:30)
numeral is a popular Pokemon uh 42 Gumi (62:28 - 62:33)
Altaria another tosuguri which I think (62:30 - 62:37)
is kind of unfair that yeah but whatever (62:33 - 62:41)
um 45 Ampharos Dragonite zarua Espeon (62:37 - 62:45)
zorark and number 50 was Tyranitar (62:41 - 62:48)
I am somewhat (62:45 - 62:50)
surprised (62:48 - 62:52)
that like (62:50 - 62:55)
Jolteon (62:52 - 62:58)
Vaporeon art (62:55 - 63:01)
in this list over (62:58 - 63:05)
Glaceon Umbreon Leafeon right like I I (63:01 - 63:07)
always sort of assumed that the Gen 1 (63:05 - 63:10)
Evie Evolutions always were really high (63:07 - 63:12)
but no no I'm around Espeon are always (63:10 - 63:15)
really high I mean I knew those but I I (63:12 - 63:16)
always thought (63:15 - 63:19)
yeah and Leafeon being so high is weird (63:16 - 63:21)
especially higher than Espeon because (63:19 - 63:23)
it's always like Umbreon number two (63:21 - 63:25)
Espeon number three and like Jolteon (63:23 - 63:28)
Flareon and Vaporeon aren't in this list (63:25 - 63:31)
at all (63:28 - 63:31)
for good reason they're not yeah but I I (63:31 - 63:37)
just I always sort of assumed like the (63:35 - 63:39)
Gen wonders would come out for those and (63:37 - 63:41)
they didn't (63:39 - 63:44)
I mean look the the the the the Gengar (63:41 - 63:46)
people were there they're the the Gengar (63:44 - 63:48)
people were secretly worse than the (63:46 - 63:50)
Charizard people we've just discussed (63:48 - 63:52)
this before they're they're everywhere (63:50 - 63:53)
here's the here's the I think the most (63:52 - 63:55)
interesting thing on this is Corydon is (63:53 - 63:57)
significant not second karaton is higher (63:55 - 63:59)
than we ride on we know that we know (63:57 - 64:02)
based off pictures which are very (63:59 - 64:05)
scientifical and data driven that if you (64:02 - 64:06)
see a bunch of pictures of the Pokemon (64:05 - 64:09)
Center uh there is a million car ride on (64:06 - 64:11)
plushes and there are no me ride on (64:09 - 64:14)
plushes this is this is this was a very (64:11 - 64:16)
common thing one Shelf (64:14 - 64:20)
uh it was one shelf this is this is a (64:16 - 64:21)
very common theme with zashin and (64:20 - 64:23)
zamazunta it was very easy to find some (64:21 - 64:25)
ascenta plushes zashian plushes were (64:23 - 64:27)
always sold out (64:25 - 64:30)
um if you look at any kind of polling it (64:27 - 64:33)
was like uh Violet was like a 60 to 70 (64:30 - 64:37)
percent over over Scarlet like violet (64:33 - 64:39)
was just looked at polling specifically (64:37 - 64:41)
for Corydon and miraidon especially (64:39 - 64:43)
after the games came out (64:41 - 64:46)
coradon was the favorite was the (64:43 - 64:48)
preferred one I mean clearly from this (64:46 - 64:49)
poll I'm feeling pretty good as someone (64:48 - 64:51)
who chose Scarlet from the very (64:49 - 64:54)
beginning no what I am saying is I think (64:51 - 64:55)
the game's coming out (64:54 - 64:59)
really showed that Corydon was the more (64:55 - 65:01)
interesting Legend (64:59 - 65:04)
um and I felt this way personally like I (65:01 - 65:05)
picked Violet just because I liked (65:04 - 65:07)
purple right that was my that was my (65:05 - 65:09)
whole Choice which one do you I like (65:07 - 65:10)
purple I'm gonna pick the game that's (65:09 - 65:12)
purple (65:10 - 65:15)
um and I never really felt a good (65:12 - 65:17)
connection with my ride on I thought it (65:15 - 65:18)
was cool like he's like a robot dragon (65:17 - 65:21)
he's pretty alright but like when I (65:18 - 65:23)
watched people's cutscenes for Corydon I (65:21 - 65:25)
was like man why is Corydon way cooler (65:23 - 65:28)
like it just has more personality even (65:25 - 65:30)
though they're like the same cutscenes (65:28 - 65:33)
but like I feel like Horizon was just (65:30 - 65:36)
animated like better I always wonder if (65:33 - 65:38)
it's (65:36 - 65:41)
there's always a there's sort of a built (65:38 - 65:43)
in (65:41 - 65:43)
golf between anything that is clearly (65:44 - 65:49)
somewhat robotic like I think as humans (65:46 - 65:54)
we tend to look at mechanical things (65:49 - 65:57)
through a very different lens and (65:54 - 65:59)
there's no way to get beyond the very (65:57 - 66:02)
mechanical electric and slightly robotic (65:59 - 66:04)
feel of (66:02 - 66:08)
like the whole iron area then you're (66:04 - 66:11)
very biased against them though yeah (66:08 - 66:15)
biases on this show never (66:11 - 66:15)
I think it might be particularly true (66:15 - 66:22)
for you Greg look I I prefer right I (66:18 - 66:25)
never cry done I think I was I like my (66:22 - 66:27)
electric lizard better than I like than (66:25 - 66:28)
I like the Derpy thing running around on (66:27 - 66:30)
his legs but it's got wheels that's what (66:28 - 66:32)
I love I know I don't like it I love I (66:30 - 66:34)
love that I I think I think a lot of (66:32 - 66:38)
people connected with karate on more (66:34 - 66:40)
then people connect with them arriving (66:38 - 66:42)
the polling shows this like I wouldn't (66:40 - 66:44)
say I'm a ride on like I wouldn't say (66:42 - 66:45)
maridon was one of my favorites after (66:44 - 66:47)
playing but if I but every time I watch (66:45 - 66:49)
somebody play Scarlet I was like man (66:47 - 66:51)
karate is Way Cool like he's running on (66:49 - 66:53)
legs he got this big old tongue hanging (66:51 - 66:55)
out of his mouth like and he he seemed (66:53 - 66:58)
more whatever uh it's it's a poll but I (66:55 - 66:59)
just thought that was interesting that (66:58 - 67:02)
Violet obviously sold more copies (66:59 - 67:07)
but Corydon placed higher on this list (67:02 - 67:09)
uh the other shocking thing is there's (67:07 - 67:12)
no quaxley on this list at all (67:09 - 67:14)
um (67:12 - 67:14)
made it to number 32. (67:15 - 67:20)
um which you know (67:18 - 67:21)
some people don't like the design some (67:20 - 67:25)
people do but usually starters yeah are (67:21 - 67:27)
incredibly popular compared to their (67:25 - 67:28)
final evolution (67:27 - 67:31)
uh and we scalar Ridge is on the list (67:28 - 67:33)
miascarat is on the list and then (67:31 - 67:35)
obviously sprigatito and foikoko very (67:33 - 67:38)
high on the list but yeah there was no (67:35 - 67:40)
quaxley at all (67:38 - 67:42)
um (67:40 - 67:42)
plot tire is great he came in at number (67:43 - 67:49)
two uh I mean no complaints there no I (67:45 - 67:52)
love what my blood sir number one no and (67:49 - 67:54)
I I wonder if quad sire is up there so (67:52 - 67:57)
high because I feel like quadcire was (67:54 - 68:00)
for a lot of people an easy carry in a (67:57 - 68:02)
lot of gyms like clothesiers seemed to (68:00 - 68:04)
like just have the right typing and the (68:02 - 68:05)
Right Moves to like get through most (68:04 - 68:08)
gyms with no problem it's a very good (68:05 - 68:11)
typing just in general like it it does a (68:08 - 68:14)
lot and it gets access to a lot (68:11 - 68:16)
and you get it so early yeah so it's (68:14 - 68:18)
easier for people to get it and it was (68:16 - 68:20)
kind of a a surprise because it was the (68:18 - 68:22)
New Evolution for the regional variant (68:20 - 68:24)
of uber yeah (68:22 - 68:27)
uh for Paradox Pokemon (68:24 - 68:29)
um the only one in the (68:27 - 68:31)
no there was a couple in the past so we (68:29 - 68:33)
have Slither wings uh Slither Wing sorry (68:31 - 68:35)
and then there was flutter Main and (68:33 - 68:38)
scream tail so those were all from (68:35 - 68:41)
scarlet and then the only future one was (68:38 - 68:43)
iron Valiant which (68:41 - 68:44)
you know makes sense people like (68:43 - 68:47)
Gardevoir Glade shocking that there's no (68:44 - 68:49)
um roaring Moon and there's no salamance (68:47 - 68:51)
on this list at all like salamance is an (68:49 - 68:53)
incredibly popular Pokemon they they (68:51 - 68:54)
were the only one of the only pseudo (68:53 - 68:56)
legendaries that didn't make top 50 and (68:54 - 68:58)
I thought but you know when I looked at (68:56 - 69:01)
all the Paradox I was like oh like (68:58 - 69:03)
roaring moon is gonna be the number one (69:01 - 69:05)
for everyone and it's it's it's not I (69:03 - 69:08)
guess I think screamtail's great (69:05 - 69:10)
um I don't love flutter Maine I I never (69:08 - 69:13)
liked misdreavus or Miss magius they're (69:10 - 69:15)
flutter Maine's just like (69:13 - 69:18)
bigger necklace like put put that Marge (69:15 - 69:20)
Simpson necklace on (69:18 - 69:22)
ask me how much longer one of its (69:20 - 69:25)
eyebrows is than the (69:22 - 69:25)
than the other I don't think I've (69:27 - 69:30)
noticed that (69:28 - 69:32)
well you'll notice it now oh yeah yeah (69:30 - 69:33)
now I will (69:32 - 69:35)
um (69:33 - 69:37)
I don't get the appeal of glamora I (69:35 - 69:40)
think it's cool but not like the thing (69:37 - 69:42)
is is when isn't it I don't get the (69:40 - 69:44)
appeal when it's closed up form when (69:42 - 69:46)
it's in its flower form I absolutely (69:44 - 69:48)
understand the appeal when it's on the (69:46 - 69:51)
walls in case yes but I think when they (69:48 - 69:53)
ever put it in list it's like this weird (69:51 - 69:55)
torpedo thing and I'm like that just (69:53 - 69:56)
that is not the version you should be (69:55 - 69:59)
using because it's so much better and (69:56 - 70:01)
it's open flower form (69:59 - 70:04)
uh apparently Pokemon fans like swords (70:01 - 70:06)
uh because zashian number one but also (70:04 - 70:08)
uh well not on this list but you know (70:06 - 70:11)
how people love zashian uh so real Edge (70:08 - 70:13)
being number five here and armor Rouge (70:11 - 70:18)
not in the top 50 at all I I liked armor (70:13 - 70:20)
Rouge more nah srilage is so much better (70:18 - 70:26)
so cooler uh tasaguri uh tosukuri is (70:20 - 70:28)
great I think people just like the the (70:26 - 70:30)
concept of like it's a sushi Pokemon (70:28 - 70:33)
what more do you want sushi Dragon it's (70:30 - 70:35)
awesome (70:33 - 70:35)
um Mouse hold being on here also not (70:35 - 70:38)
surprising (70:37 - 70:41)
uh (70:38 - 70:41)
I I mean like we go through each one but (70:43 - 70:46)
it's a pretty it's a pretty interesting (70:45 - 70:49)
list I would like to you know maybe (70:46 - 70:53)
revisit uh uh top 50 Pokemon (70:49 - 70:55)
in a couple months to see what has (70:53 - 70:57)
changed or you know sometimes it takes a (70:55 - 70:58)
while for people to connect with (70:57 - 71:01)
specifically I'm waiting for the online (70:58 - 71:03)
checker app and check back to add all (71:01 - 71:06)
the dead nines so I can redo my top 10 (71:03 - 71:07)
by making where you click through and (71:06 - 71:09)
say I picked these five out of this list (71:07 - 71:11)
do you think tickets is that high for (71:09 - 71:13)
you Greg (71:11 - 71:17)
has replaced definitely uh has kicked a (71:13 - 71:19)
couple things out of the out of the (71:17 - 71:22)
running for sure out of my top ten I (71:19 - 71:24)
honestly think (71:22 - 71:26)
um (71:24 - 71:26)
like Empoleon is on the edge now (71:27 - 71:32)
like I have to strongly think if (71:30 - 71:34)
Napoleon falls out of the top ten (71:32 - 71:37)
because the tinkerton exists (71:34 - 71:39)
I would like tinkerton more if I didn't (71:37 - 71:43)
love korvanite that's the problem for me (71:39 - 71:47)
if coronite wasn't an invasive species (71:43 - 71:49)
we wouldn't have this issue now would we (71:47 - 71:53)
government's good for raids by the way (71:49 - 71:53)
well (71:54 - 71:59)
we'll end or will starts 2023 with an (71:55 - 72:00)
important question I want to know your (71:59 - 72:03)
guys's favorite Paradox Pokemon from (72:00 - 72:05)
scarlet and your favorite Paradox (72:03 - 72:08)
Pokemon from violet (72:05 - 72:08)
tough (72:08 - 72:12)
no not tough (72:09 - 72:15)
they they match up with the list for me (72:12 - 72:17)
I like and I and I don't have their (72:15 - 72:19)
names yet because I haven't been (72:17 - 72:20)
interacting with them as much in game (72:19 - 72:23)
but uh slither (72:20 - 72:25)
tail what's that one Slither wing (72:23 - 72:28)
and iron Valiant the two that are the (72:25 - 72:29)
top for each of them on that list okay (72:28 - 72:32)
those are my favorites (72:29 - 72:32)
I really like roaring Moon a lot (72:33 - 72:40)
um I hate Sandy shocks a burning pattern (72:37 - 72:43)
move though have you seen him walk I (72:40 - 72:45)
have it's awful I hate every aspect of (72:43 - 72:47)
it I hate (72:45 - 72:48)
um it's I mean that's not surprising you (72:47 - 72:49)
don't like Magnemite I don't like (72:48 - 72:52)
Magnemite and they made it worse (72:49 - 72:54)
um I gave them fur Greg they gave the (72:52 - 72:56)
robot a fur they didn't they gave it (72:54 - 72:59)
magnetic sand and called it it's awful (72:56 - 73:01)
it's awful so I really I really think (72:59 - 73:03)
roaring Moon's a great design I do too (73:01 - 73:04)
um (73:03 - 73:10)
for the future ones I I I do really like (73:04 - 73:12)
uh (73:10 - 73:14)
uh iron Valiant I think iron valiant's (73:12 - 73:17)
cute but I am I honestly sort of lean (73:14 - 73:21)
more towards iron junglers I think (73:17 - 73:23)
I think that taken High dragon is really (73:21 - 73:25)
good (73:23 - 73:29)
um I'm not a huge fan of iron bundle (73:25 - 73:33)
it's fine but it doesn't sing to me (73:29 - 73:36)
it not only is iron bundle the best (73:33 - 73:39)
Violet Paradox mod he has the best name (73:36 - 73:42)
I (73:39 - 73:42)
I think what sells me on iron bundle is (73:43 - 73:49)
his feet are a little skis they're (73:46 - 73:52)
really great it's no I can't it's pretty (73:49 - 73:55)
well designed here thing is it's a good (73:52 - 73:57)
design but I I don't particularly like (73:55 - 74:00)
the deli Bird design again I'm not a Gen (73:57 - 74:01)
2 (74:00 - 74:03)
fam (74:01 - 74:03)
um (74:03 - 74:07)
so like seeing a slightly weirder (74:03 - 74:09)
version of it just does not do anything (74:07 - 74:10)
for me (74:09 - 74:13)
um Iron hands is okay I'm just not a (74:10 - 74:15)
hariyama fan so iron hands didn't do (74:13 - 74:17)
anything for me I do think iron moth is (74:15 - 74:20)
a is a good design (74:17 - 74:23)
and I think iron Thorns is a good Mecha (74:20 - 74:26)
Godzilla design like I can appreciate (74:23 - 74:30)
like the Kaiju aspects of them when they (74:26 - 74:32)
make Mecca versions of the Kaiju like I (74:30 - 74:35)
like those I think they're good (74:32 - 74:37)
um the thing I have a problem with some (74:35 - 74:40)
of the ancient Pokemon is they don't (74:37 - 74:43)
feel (74:40 - 74:43)
particularly Primal enough for me (74:43 - 74:47)
like (74:46 - 74:52)
which ones I I don't feel I feel I like (74:47 - 74:55)
scream tail feels like 80s Mall more (74:52 - 74:59)
than ancient civilization to me uh brute (74:55 - 75:02)
Bonnet feels Hot Topic bad hair to me (74:59 - 75:04)
than primal (75:02 - 75:06)
jungle to me I think flutter means (75:04 - 75:08)
pretty good I think slithering is really (75:06 - 75:10)
good Sandy shocks is terrible I think (75:08 - 75:13)
roaring Moon feels really Primal to me I (75:10 - 75:15)
think great Tusk feels very Primal kind (75:13 - 75:17)
of along the lines of the mama swine (75:15 - 75:20)
line I just feel like scream tail and (75:17 - 75:23)
brute Bonnet are way too (75:20 - 75:23)
my past 80s 70s weird design than (75:24 - 75:32)
ancient civilization he designed (75:28 - 75:32)
see this is intentional (75:34 - 75:36)
um (75:36 - 75:39)
is all the future Pokemon are iron yeah (75:36 - 75:42)
and then all the past Pokemon like (75:39 - 75:44)
nothing repeats itself Sandy brute great (75:42 - 75:48)
scream flutter Slither roaring (75:44 - 75:50)
um and then all the the iron Pokemon at (75:48 - 75:52)
least from my perspective is they they (75:50 - 75:53)
look (75:52 - 75:55)
like (75:53 - 75:57)
current Pokemon like they just look like (75:55 - 76:00)
robotic versions like I I like I think (75:57 - 76:02)
the high Dragon one doesn't really (76:00 - 76:04)
actually look that different (76:02 - 76:06)
um it just looks more robotic at least (76:04 - 76:08)
with like (76:06 - 76:10)
I guess the same for Tyranitar at least (76:08 - 76:12)
the the Gardevoir one is like gardevoort (76:10 - 76:14)
and Gallade mixed together yeah but the (76:12 - 76:17)
the old ones like like even like I think (76:14 - 76:18)
I don't know why they did this I don't (76:17 - 76:21)
know why like Volcarona and Don fan got (76:18 - 76:24)
like double dipping treatment but like (76:21 - 76:27)
iron moth looks like a Volcarona and (76:24 - 76:28)
Slither rings (76:27 - 76:30)
kind of (76:28 - 76:33)
like it does but like no not us it does (76:30 - 76:36)
but like it's it it you can tell they're (76:33 - 76:37)
related but it's not the same Pokemon (76:36 - 76:41)
right it's not like a moth like it it's (76:37 - 76:43)
not like (76:41 - 76:43)
it's it's literally the mouth on this on (76:44 - 76:49)
the ground it's just walking (76:47 - 76:51)
it's not though (76:49 - 76:54)
it has like it has like a thick dinosaur (76:51 - 76:57)
tail too like Volcarona and iron moth (76:54 - 76:59)
don't have like this huge green thick (76:57 - 77:01)
tail coming out of it but like it (76:59 - 77:02)
doesn't have a tail at all because it's (77:01 - 77:03)
a moth (77:02 - 77:05)
it's just like the the the old Pokemon (77:03 - 77:09)
like like a Mungus or brute Bonnet like (77:05 - 77:12)
it literally has a beak whereas like a (77:09 - 77:14)
Mungus doesn't have a beak (77:12 - 77:17)
um it's like really kind of like none of (77:14 - 77:19)
this is bad by the way it's just like it (77:17 - 77:22)
it with the names and the designs it's (77:19 - 77:23)
like the paradox (77:22 - 77:26)
past Pokemon are more Stark (77:23 - 77:28)
uh and the future Pokemon are just like (77:26 - 77:30)
Yep this is a robotic Deli bird this is (77:28 - 77:32)
a robotic Tyranitar they made a very (77:30 - 77:33)
interesting (77:32 - 77:37)
dystopian choice for future (77:33 - 77:37)
um and like it's an it is definitely an (77:37 - 77:43)
interesting (77:42 - 77:46)
design decision because they did do very (77:43 - 77:49)
a very dystopian (77:46 - 77:53)
artificial feel kind of kind of it it (77:49 - 77:54)
sort of feeds into this sort of weird (77:53 - 77:57)
like dire warning of where we're going (77:54 - 78:00)
without being really in your face but (77:57 - 78:03)
they did do a very sort of (78:00 - 78:06)
natural things don't survive in the (78:03 - 78:08)
future and it's it's a very dystopian (78:06 - 78:09)
take (78:08 - 78:12)
and you either like that taker or you (78:09 - 78:15)
don't and like there is a and a lot of (78:12 - 78:16)
people are like you wouldn't name (78:15 - 78:18)
everything iron and I think that for me (78:16 - 78:22)
that feeds into the dystopian homogeny (78:18 - 78:25)
that is part of a lot of (78:22 - 78:28)
uh sort of dire warning future anime (78:25 - 78:31)
dire warning future story lines like (78:28 - 78:34)
unless we take action now we are going (78:31 - 78:37)
towards a less diverse more artificial (78:34 - 78:39)
society and I think they really took (78:37 - 78:40)
that (78:39 - 78:43)
Trope to Heart here which is why the (78:40 - 78:45)
names don't bother me (78:43 - 78:50)
um I I hope in the DLC they will explore (78:45 - 78:53)
that design Choice more because again I (78:50 - 78:57)
agree that the names in the past are (78:53 - 78:59)
more interesting but also whenever we we (78:57 - 79:02)
tend to romanticize the past and we all (78:59 - 79:04)
have this big dinosaur kick right like (79:02 - 79:06)
we're fascinated by the big lizards and (79:04 - 79:08)
we give them wild names and we pretend (79:06 - 79:10)
that they all look like lizards when in (79:08 - 79:11)
reality they all head fur we have no (79:10 - 79:12)
idea what they actually look like right (79:11 - 79:15)
like we're guessing what right now based (79:12 - 79:17)
off of Bones and we're not good at (79:15 - 79:19)
drawing what they look like but there (79:17 - 79:21)
there is a in the design choices there (79:19 - 79:24)
is a (79:21 - 79:28)
romanticized savagery of the past (79:24 - 79:31)
that doesn't necessarily match up like (79:28 - 79:33)
these are all really Savage looking (79:31 - 79:36)
things and there's a very clear (79:33 - 79:38)
deliberate design choice for the future (79:36 - 79:41)
of a very sanitized homogeneous thing (79:38 - 79:42)
and I think (79:41 - 79:44)
looking at them both I think they were (79:42 - 79:48)
really big strong design choices but (79:44 - 79:50)
things like (79:48 - 79:53)
like let's make a Savage scream tail a (79:50 - 79:56)
Jigglypuff I I don't think that works as (79:53 - 80:00)
well as let's make a more Savage looking (79:56 - 80:04)
Volcarona in that slither ring like (80:00 - 80:06)
yeah there's no there's no doubt there (80:04 - 80:08)
was like a lot of thought going in oh (80:06 - 80:10)
yeah um and I think maybe (80:08 - 80:13)
the future stuff seems really sterile on (80:10 - 80:14)
purpose that's why they all have the (80:13 - 80:17)
same names and the the past stuff also (80:14 - 80:19)
sees it seems on purpose because like (80:17 - 80:22)
misdreavus (80:19 - 80:22)
uh Jigglypuff and Magneton those are not (80:22 - 80:29)
the final forms the all three of those (80:26 - 80:31)
evolve but they all evolve with stones (80:29 - 80:33)
right so they're they're probably (80:31 - 80:34)
they're stating like oh those stones (80:33 - 80:36)
weren't around and that that's why it's (80:34 - 80:39)
a Jigglypuff and not a wiggly tough (80:36 - 80:41)
yeah they made some very interesting (80:39 - 80:43)
like if you really just think about what (80:41 - 80:45)
they're trying to say without them (80:43 - 80:47)
saying it like both future empaths have (80:45 - 80:50)
very interesting stories (80:47 - 80:54)
um particularly since most of the uh (80:50 - 80:57)
most of the future even though they're (80:54 - 80:59)
called iron aren't (80:57 - 81:01)
Steel type only one of them are Steelers (80:59 - 81:03)
yeah (81:01 - 81:03)
and so it's it there's there is so much (81:03 - 81:09)
to sort of unpack in in these designs (81:06 - 81:12)
and namings that I really hope DLC (81:09 - 81:17)
allows us to explore what they what (81:12 - 81:20)
their Vision was of the future and the (81:17 - 81:22)
past well we know that the DLC is (81:20 - 81:23)
bringing at least some more story (81:22 - 81:25)
because there have been hints saying (81:23 - 81:27)
that they clearly know that there hasn't (81:25 - 81:29)
been an explanation for how the books (81:27 - 81:33)
were in that point in time right yeah (81:29 - 81:36)
I'm very curious about it (81:33 - 81:39)
um yeah I I think both sets when you (81:36 - 81:41)
sort of look at them as sets and the (81:39 - 81:43)
choices they make tell really tell a (81:41 - 81:46)
really interesting story (81:43 - 81:49)
a story that is not going back to Kalos (81:46 - 81:52)
no oh well (81:49 - 81:54)
maybe ancient callus (81:52 - 81:58)
I I don't think so (81:54 - 81:58)
uh well that's our episode thank you for (82:00 - 82:04)
listening we made it through (82:02 - 82:07)
um again if you if you need help with (82:04 - 82:09)
with cinderace obviously by the time (82:07 - 82:11)
this podcast goes up it'll be gone but (82:09 - 82:14)
it'll be another weekend what was that (82:11 - 82:17)
the the 15th something like the 15th (82:14 - 82:19)
yeah uh (82:17 - 82:24)
12th 13th 14th and 15th um uh I'll be (82:19 - 82:28)
around on on Twitch to to help out (82:24 - 82:30)
um and I'll continue making Graphics uh (82:28 - 82:31)
you know I I plan to make another raid (82:30 - 82:33)
video of other mons that could help you (82:31 - 82:35)
I think you know people like using their (82:33 - 82:38)
favorite moms and uh (82:35 - 82:41)
I I Hannah used the word competitive (82:38 - 82:43)
earlier I don't know if I would consider (82:41 - 82:46)
them like strategic strategic yeah I was (82:43 - 82:47)
gonna say I don't know what another (82:46 - 82:49)
better word is because like you build (82:47 - 82:51)
these raid mods totally different than (82:49 - 82:53)
you build a competitive mod yeah yeah (82:51 - 82:55)
um (82:53 - 82:57)
and so (82:55 - 82:59)
um yeah I I think the stuff is really (82:57 - 83:01)
fun I'm really liking scarlet and violet (82:59 - 83:03)
I (83:01 - 83:06)
am uh very excited to see what else (83:03 - 83:08)
comes but uh this is the end of the (83:06 - 83:09)
episode so thank you Greg thank you (83:08 - 83:11)
Hannah uh if you're watching on YouTube (83:09 - 83:15)
uh uh I don't think we've what what is (83:11 - 83:16)
our what is our question for you too (83:15 - 83:19)
what should they comment (83:16 - 83:22)
I mean obviously we want to know what (83:19 - 83:24)
their favorite Paradox Pokemon are right (83:22 - 83:28)
yeah okay I like I want to know which (83:24 - 83:30)
one like we saw the official list from (83:28 - 83:32)
