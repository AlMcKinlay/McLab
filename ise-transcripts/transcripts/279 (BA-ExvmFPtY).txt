[Music] (0:02 - 0:23)
what's up everyone welcome to the 270 (0:20 - 0:25)
ninth episode of the Pokemon podcast (0:23 - 0:28)

so I'm recording this at like 11 o'clock (0:32 - 0:37)
at night I just got back from vacation (0:35 - 0:39)
people are staying in my house so that's (0:37 - 0:41)
why my voice is a bit quieter and I'm (0:39 - 0:45)

usually sound really weird show for you (0:45 - 0:49)

recorded an interview with reversal who (1:00 - 1:06)
is a very big Pokemon go youtuber so I (1:03 - 1:08)
recorded that last week before I went on (1:06 - 1:10)

I went on vacation a bunch of Pokemon (1:21 - 1:26)
news dropped pokemon world was happening (1:23 - 1:28)
I wanted to go to Worlds but I already (1:26 - 1:30)
had everything booked for Gen Con and (1:28 - 1:32)
Gen Con for me is a personal vacation (1:30 - 1:34)
that I take every year that I don't (1:32 - 1:36)
really do anything Pokemon related at (1:34 - 1:38)
all that news that dropped cuz there's a (1:36 - 1:40)
bunch of news that dropped will and I (1:38 - 1:42)
will talk about that all next week I (1:40 - 1:44)
know there's a lot I know you guys (1:42 - 1:45)
probably want to hear it but because (1:44 - 1:48)

something I'm just gonna run down that (1:56 - 2:01)
real quick again we'll talk about it all (1:58 - 2:03)
next week there's been a ton of emails (2:01 - 2:07)

to cover so just keep that in mind this (2:13 - 2:17)
episode is so really good though the (2:15 - 2:18)
interview with reversal is fantastic (2:17 - 2:21)
he's such a fantastic dude so I can't (2:18 - 2:22)
wait for you guys to hear the interview (2:21 - 2:24)
let me just run down the news real quick (2:22 - 2:27)
that happened and fill you guys in in (2:24 - 2:29)
case you were not up-to-date or you (2:27 - 2:31)
weren't following the world information (2:29 - 2:32)
and I actually might miss something (2:31 - 2:34)
myself here again (2:32 - 2:37)
I only really went over it just recently (2:34 - 2:39)
because I've been driving all day but (2:37 - 2:43)
there will be packaged versions of (2:39 - 2:45)
Pokemon go and silver coming containing (2:43 - 2:48)
a download code for the eShop available (2:45 - 2:51)
in Europe on September 22nd pretty cool (2:48 - 2:52)
if you just want a box again still (2:51 - 2:54)
downloadable though so you're gonna need (2:52 - 2:57)
internet for that there was a new ultra (2:54 - 3:00)
Sun and ultra moon trailer shown pretty (2:57 - 3:02)
good timing with worlds and everything I (3:00 - 3:04)
suspected that it would have been shown (3:02 - 3:06)
at Worlds or slightly after worlds (3:04 - 3:08)
especially we weren't going to get (3:06 - 3:10)
anything with the pokemon go stuff that (3:08 - 3:12)
has been happening so that happened they (3:10 - 3:15)
showed an updated map for a Lola and (3:12 - 3:19)
there is like what seems to be like a (3:15 - 3:21)
wormhole that's opened up on it I (3:19 - 3:23)
haven't spent enough time looking at it (3:21 - 3:25)
and reading people's theories but a new (3:23 - 3:27)
map kind of like how black and white 2 (3:25 - 3:29)
had a slight change it seems to be an (3:27 - 3:31)
oozy ring coming out for stores it's a (3:29 - 3:35)
black sea ring with new z powers that (3:31 - 3:39)
Tommy Tommy will be releasing as you (3:35 - 3:41)
know ultrasound ultra moon coming out (3:39 - 3:43)
November 17th they showed the official (3:41 - 3:46)
box art for that pokemon gold and silver (3:43 - 3:50)
will also have physical races in Japan (3:46 - 3:54)
going back to the ultrasonic ultramoon (3:50 - 3:56)
trailer the main characters the (3:54 - 4:00)
protagonist protagonists have new (3:56 - 4:02)
clothes so I guess that's exciting (4:00 - 4:05)
hopefully there will be pants what one (4:02 - 4:08)
can one can hope TCG wise this is pretty (4:05 - 4:10)
big news for the TCG and I actually at (4:08 - 4:12)
Gen Con III said that Junkins not a (4:10 - 4:14)
Pokemon related thing for me but I did (4:12 - 4:18)
enter a booster Draft at Gen Con with (4:14 - 4:20)
the TCG I played with well I played with (4:18 - 4:22)
Irene I played with Micah played with a (4:20 - 4:25)
bunch of other friends so we we do plan (4:22 - 4:26)
on talking about that next week I know (4:25 - 4:28)
sometimes we we go weeks without talking (4:26 - 4:30)
about the TCG but this is a big thing (4:28 - 4:33)
here it also announced that worlds that (4:30 - 4:36)
the ultra beasts are coming to the TCG (4:33 - 4:38)
games they showed off buzz wall and Gus (4:36 - 4:43)
Lord as TCG cards going back to the Z (4:38 - 4:44)
ring that I was talking about (4:43 - 4:47)
there will be new Z (4:44 - 4:49)
in ultra Sutton ultramoon one of them (4:47 - 4:52)
was showing off for a coma Auto gets an (4:49 - 4:55)
exclusive Z move called clangorous solo (4:52 - 4:59)
blaze which if you watch the trailer it (4:55 - 5:02)
one shots both Salem ants and a Garchomp (4:59 - 5:04)
at the same time it can hit both Pokemon (5:02 - 5:06)
does like this little song seems to be (5:04 - 5:08)
really powerful seems to be a really (5:06 - 5:10)
good counter to these pseudo legendaries (5:08 - 5:13)
that seem to be dominant in the VGC (5:10 - 5:16)
format probably over by now but during (5:13 - 5:19)
worlds in Anaheim there was Kangaskhan (5:16 - 5:21)
appearing and more Taurus appearing (5:19 - 5:24)
tauros makes sense for all the (5:21 - 5:27)
international travelers and competitors (5:24 - 5:28)
that were coming to make sure that they (5:27 - 5:31)
got our region specific Pokemon which is (5:28 - 5:33)
Taurus in the u.s. kangaskhan which is (5:31 - 5:36)
an Australian exclusive appearing in (5:33 - 5:39)
Anaheim because of the pokemon world (5:36 - 5:42)
championships on top of that unknown the (5:39 - 5:44)
rarest Pokemon in Pokemon go right now (5:42 - 5:47)
appearing in Anaheim as well what's (5:44 - 5:49)
really cool about unknown and we've (5:47 - 5:50)
talked about this before but when (5:49 - 5:52)
unknown appears at these events which is (5:50 - 5:54)
the third event first was sugar the (5:52 - 5:57)
Pokemon go fest in Chicago then it was (5:54 - 6:00)
the the Safari Zone stuff in Europe and (5:57 - 6:03)
then the Yokohama stuff in Japan at (6:00 - 6:06)
Pikachu outbreak here in Anaheim the (6:03 - 6:08)
unknown spelled world's so possible to (6:06 - 6:13)
get a wo are L D and s unknown to fill (6:08 - 6:15)
out that pokedex for you if you're you (6:13 - 6:17)
know set on trying to collect all 26 (6:15 - 6:20)
unknown and when Gen 3 comes out all (6:17 - 6:22)
twenty-eight ultrasounded ultramoon are (6:20 - 6:24)
also going to feature what's called a (6:22 - 6:25)
Lola Photo Club (6:24 - 6:26)
I haven't read too much about that but (6:25 - 6:28)
that's something we'll be talking about (6:26 - 6:31)
next week or each op wise if you have a (6:28 - 6:33)
Nintendo switch there will be a demo for (6:31 - 6:36)
pokken tournament DX so if you haven't (6:33 - 6:38)
played it you own a switch so which (6:36 - 6:39)
seems to be doing way better than the (6:38 - 6:42)
Wii U that is something coming they (6:39 - 6:45)
showed some artwork for the kamon iam Z (6:42 - 6:47)
which is the Z crystal for como oh oh (6:45 - 6:50)
and finally and then they I apologize (6:47 - 6:52)
I'm probably missing some news finally (6:50 - 6:55)
the 2018 World Championships will be (6:52 - 6:58)
held in Nashville Tennessee next year (6:55 - 7:00)
2018 (6:58 - 7:03)
so that might be easier for people to (7:00 - 7:05)
travel to and it might be cheaper (7:03 - 7:09)
hopefully they can accommodate or (7:05 - 7:10)
they're piling for more people to come (7:09 - 7:14)
since it does seem to be from what I (7:10 - 7:16)
have gathered on social media a place (7:14 - 7:18)
that people are very excited to go to (7:16 - 7:20)
just because of cost and because of (7:18 - 7:23)
getting there alone California that (7:20 - 7:25)
whole area is one very expensive to (7:23 - 7:28)
travel to and to kind of hard to get to (7:25 - 7:30)
by car especially if you're coming from (7:28 - 7:32)
like New York or Boston or Atlanta or (7:30 - 7:35)
even though most of the Midwest where (7:32 - 7:37)
Nashville is more centralized between (7:35 - 7:40)
that so that is the bit of news I have (7:37 - 7:44)
and that's it yes so hopefully next week (7:40 - 7:46)
will be a really really exciting show (7:44 - 7:48)
like I said will will join me will cover (7:46 - 7:51)
all this more in depth and tackle your (7:48 - 7:53)
guys's emails because there's been a lot (7:51 - 7:54)
of great emails this week if you have (7:53 - 7:56)
your own email questions comments (7:54 - 7:58)
concerns about the show you can email me (7:56 - 8:04)

with reversal again we talked about (8:07 - 8:10)
Pokemon go we talked about his history (8:09 - 8:12)
with Pokemon we talked about clickbait (8:10 - 8:14)
because that's a hot topic on YouTube (8:12 - 8:16)
but I'll let you guys hear it yeah there (8:14 - 8:18)
might be a little bit of outro at the (8:16 - 8:20)
end of the show I'm not sure yet again (8:18 - 8:21)
it's late I'm trying to get this all cut (8:20 - 8:23)

inviting me I'm great (9:18 - 9:22)
how are you I'm good I'm good like all (9:20 - 9:24)
our interviews I'm mitsue perfective (9:22 - 9:26)
we'll start off with some Pokemon we'll (9:24 - 9:28)
probably actually talk a little bit (9:26 - 9:29)
about your YouTube career since that is (9:28 - 9:31)
that is your big thing and then we'll (9:29 - 9:34)
end with Pokemon mm-hmm just a little (9:31 - 9:35)
agenda here but let's kind of talk about (9:34 - 9:38)
how we met it was at Pokemon go fest (9:35 - 9:42)
yeah Chicago actually yeah it was really (9:38 - 9:45)
nice it was kind of unexpected saw this (9:42 - 9:48)
guy with this equipment like audio (9:45 - 9:50)
camera source (9:48 - 9:52)
I mean audio equipment that was like oh (9:50 - 9:54)
that's interesting then I found out (9:52 - 9:56)
you've got a podcast and everything else (9:54 - 9:58)
kind of intrigue I don't want to talk (9:56 - 10:01)
about YouTube right off the bat but you (9:58 - 10:02)
know I've always been told that the (10:01 - 10:05)
YouTube community is is very close-knit (10:02 - 10:07)
very tight together they have each (10:05 - 10:10)
other's backs and I think that was very (10:07 - 10:12)
apparent at Pokemon go fest I walk into (10:10 - 10:15)
like the media tent and all you guys (10:12 - 10:17)
knew each other and by I mean all you (10:15 - 10:19)
guys I mean you know trainer tips and (10:17 - 10:21)
twin tendo and you and a bunch of other (10:19 - 10:23)
people that I apologized that I didn't (10:21 - 10:28)
know who they were and then mystic 666 (10:23 - 10:32)
but you guys seem to be like this (10:28 - 10:34)
this pretty tight community of you know (10:32 - 10:39)
youtubers yeah partially because it took (10:34 - 10:42)
Niantic such a long time to reach out to (10:39 - 10:45)
any of us and because of that we can (10:42 - 10:48)
alike we're like you know we kind of (10:45 - 10:49)
probably like stick together (10:48 - 10:53)
seeing as some of the initial comfort (10:49 - 10:54)
encouraged because everybody was you (10:53 - 10:56)
know almost creating like let's say all (10:54 - 10:59)
the mainstream youtubers everybody went (10:56 - 11:01)
in on Pokemon go because it was such a (10:59 - 11:03)
big thing this is normal it got some (11:01 - 11:06)
views but then they start to drop off (11:03 - 11:08)
one at a time and eventually there's (11:06 - 11:11)
this tight group of dedicated content (11:08 - 11:12)
creators we (11:11 - 11:15)
HR sticking with Pokemon go and (11:12 - 11:17)
eventually got to the point where you (11:15 - 11:20)
want to go out and travel and you start (11:17 - 11:22)
to talk to each other to get insights (11:20 - 11:24)
into certain scenarios and it's like hey (11:22 - 11:26)
do you know anything about this or do (11:24 - 11:28)
you know anything about that and if (11:26 - 11:30)
actually become friends so that's where (11:28 - 11:33)
most of us not everybody but most of us (11:30 - 11:35)
I already knew each other before Pokemon (11:33 - 11:38)
go fast got it let's back up a little (11:35 - 11:40)
bit for my listeners that may not know (11:38 - 11:44)
who you are what you do I said you're a (11:40 - 11:46)
youtuber I said Pokemon go but what (11:44 - 11:48)
exactly do you do on a day to day basis (11:46 - 11:50)
so I keep myself visit with Pokemon go I (11:48 - 11:54)
should know I just primarily I only (11:50 - 11:56)
right now do Pokemon go content on my (11:54 - 11:59)
youtube channel and I really like to (11:56 - 12:02)
bring Pokemon go from him from an (11:59 - 12:05)
experience as if the viewer the player (12:02 - 12:07)
the one interest in Bochum ago actually (12:05 - 12:12)
were to be there so I I tried to get (12:07 - 12:13)
some cool shots in from time to time but (12:12 - 12:16)
mostly I'd like to keep it real and I'd (12:13 - 12:20)
like to to share my perspective as a (12:16 - 12:22)
passionate player to my audience so (12:20 - 12:25)
that's what I'm doing so I'm an overly (12:22 - 12:27)
enthusiastic pokemon go player with (12:25 - 12:28)
essentially a youtube channel that (12:27 - 12:32)
that's the gist of this really poor (12:28 - 12:35)
Pokemon you know being as big as it as (12:32 - 12:38)
it is now with Pokemon go where did your (12:35 - 12:42)
love of Pokemon stem from it's you know (12:38 - 12:43)
I know because I've been following you (12:42 - 12:46)
for a while but where did that develop (12:43 - 12:49)
elementary school essentially I'm 28 now (12:46 - 12:54)
so I grew up on Pokemon I was in sixth (12:49 - 12:55)
grade where I was ten years old when (12:54 - 12:58)
Pokemon go what pokemon got released and (12:55 - 13:01)
it it exploded it came a little bit (12:58 - 13:02)
later in Europe because I'm from the (13:01 - 13:04)
Netherlands it came a little bit later (13:02 - 13:06)
to the Netherlands than it came in the (13:04 - 13:09)
u.s. so I think a year or two later or (13:06 - 13:11)
so it got introduced in my country and (13:09 - 13:14)
the moment it hit Fox kids at the time (13:11 - 13:17)
it just was an instant hit and everybody (13:14 - 13:19)
was talking about it and a Trading car (13:17 - 13:21)
soon followed up and they had the (13:19 - 13:24)
Gameboy game and literally everything (13:21 - 13:26)
Kame pokemon it was like the the biggest (13:24 - 13:28)
race there's nothing like you know (13:26 - 13:30)
frigid spinners are a thing now yeah (13:28 - 13:33)
yeah imagine that explosion of interest (13:30 - 13:37)
but then multiplied by five six even ten (13:33 - 13:39)
times and then you have Pokemon so (13:37 - 13:43)
everybody knew Pokemon everybody lift (13:39 - 13:44)
Pokemon essentially this little kid (13:43 - 13:46)
everybody was interested so yeah if you (13:44 - 13:49)
weren't into Pokemon you said she would (13:46 - 13:52)
be out so yeah that's where we all grew (13:49 - 13:54)
up on Pokemon it's funny you bring up (13:52 - 13:56)
fidget spinners because that's let's (13:54 - 13:58)
look the big hot fad right now but I (13:56 - 14:00)
felt like people thought that of Pokemon (13:58 - 14:02)
at the time oh yeah this is a fad and (14:00 - 14:05)
it'll burn out and it it definitely like (14:02 - 14:07)
decreased in popularity but I don't (14:05 - 14:10)
think it ever burnt out I think right (14:07 - 14:13)
now in fact whenever Pokemon go got (14:10 - 14:15)
released it reached an all-time high (14:13 - 14:18)
because you had because obviously it's (14:15 - 14:24)
been 20 years since and the all-time I (14:18 - 14:26)
feel the all-time interest in Pokemon (14:24 - 14:28)
has achieved its peak with Pokemon (14:26 - 14:31)
ghosts released because you have older (14:28 - 14:33)
generations people that aren't (14:31 - 14:35)
interested in Pokemon go and the newer (14:33 - 14:38)
generation which are right now all part (14:35 - 14:39)
of this thing called Pokemon which you (14:38 - 14:42)
all have a common interest in and then (14:39 - 14:44)
of course you got the the game boys and (14:42 - 14:47)
the DS versions and the 3ds versus now (14:44 - 14:50)
so yes it's really really big so growing (14:47 - 14:52)
up you mentioned the games and the card (14:50 - 14:53)
games did you ever like fall out of (14:52 - 14:55)
Pokemon or was that something that you (14:53 - 14:57)
stuck through through xx a long time 20 (14:55 - 14:59)
years but did you stick through it the (14:57 - 15:01)
20 years interest has always been sort (14:59 - 15:03)
of there in the back of my mind but yeah (15:01 - 15:04)
I just fall out of it (15:03 - 15:09)
I around sapphire and ruby emerald (15:04 - 15:13)
that's was I played dos until my (15:09 - 15:16)
cartridge actually broke because my my (15:13 - 15:18)
gameboy advance (15:16 - 15:21)
didn't really manage well I guess threw (15:18 - 15:24)
off the usage but after that I I kind of (15:21 - 15:26)
grew up I guess a little bit and I fell (15:24 - 15:29)
out of Pokemon and I tried the black and (15:26 - 15:31)
white a little bit but that didn't (15:29 - 15:32)
really resonate with me it was a little (15:31 - 15:34)
bit like strange like all these (15:32 - 15:37)
chandeliers and like ice cream (15:34 - 15:39)
with my faces on this and I was right (15:37 - 15:42)
here yeah then with Pokemon go it just (15:39 - 15:44)
came out back I guess ok so it was it (15:42 - 15:46)
was really Pokemon go that brought you (15:44 - 15:49)
back in fully yeah I guess so (15:46 - 15:53)
yeah yeah now your your YouTube career a (15:49 - 15:55)
little bit a little bit interesting (15:53 - 15:58)
compared to maybe others but you were (15:55 - 16:01)
like super into clash of clans in clash (15:58 - 16:05)
Royale if I'm not mistaken yeah yeah are (16:01 - 16:07)
you still playing those games or is it (16:05 - 16:11)
now 7% Pokemon go Pokemon go go at least (16:07 - 16:14)
I haven't touched the game since it's (16:11 - 16:16)
just been having a weird effect on me (16:14 - 16:19)
but yeah I used to play it call for (16:16 - 16:20)
those games and used to play those games (16:19 - 16:23)
and I would even visit the developers at (16:20 - 16:25)
their headquarters in finland helsinki (16:23 - 16:27)
and it was all great but it's just like (16:25 - 16:30)
I feel that Pokemon go kind of filled up (16:27 - 16:32)
the gap of emptiness it's really strange (16:30 - 16:35)
to explain but doing content on YouTube (16:32 - 16:38)
for a specific game like clash Royale or (16:35 - 16:41)
boom Beach clash of clans you just sit (16:38 - 16:43)
in in your house all day trying to (16:41 - 16:44)
figure out like hey what is the next (16:43 - 16:47)
video that I am gonna try to produce (16:44 - 16:51)
because I wasn't I'm not like super (16:47 - 16:53)
established youtuber at the time I was (16:51 - 16:55)
just reached 100,000 subscriber mark (16:53 - 16:58)
which is a lot of people but you haven't (16:55 - 17:01)
made it yet so to speak if you reach (16:58 - 17:03)
that point so you still have to innovate (17:01 - 17:05)
and come up with interesting content you (17:03 - 17:07)
still gotta work so hard in order to (17:05 - 17:10)
make sure you stay relevant to a certain (17:07 - 17:12)
degree and then when Pokemon go got (17:10 - 17:14)
released it was like all of these videos (17:12 - 17:16)
they could just come out and I would (17:14 - 17:19)
have so much fun doing them and I and I (17:16 - 17:21)
still very much hope the same feeling (17:19 - 17:22)
towards that so it's just such a nice (17:21 - 17:24)
thing to go outside to shoot a video (17:22 - 17:27)
instead of being inside and crease your (17:24 - 17:29)
brain about what to do next I have it up (17:27 - 17:32)
right here it looks like July 6 2016 was (17:29 - 17:35)
your first Pokemon go video a half a (17:32 - 17:38)
million views yeah and I'm not seeing (17:35 - 17:42)
I'm not seeing any anything but Pokemon (17:38 - 17:44)
go after that (17:42 - 17:47)
yeah I just think that's interesting (17:44 - 17:49)
because it it and and I would love for (17:47 - 17:52)
you to explain it you had a following of (17:49 - 17:55)
these clash Royale players and these (17:52 - 17:56)
clash of clans players and they probably (17:55 - 17:59)
you know woke up on July is it July July (17:56 - 18:00)
6 June 6 (17:59 - 18:03)
yeah July 6 July 6 and all of a sudden (18:00 - 18:05)
you know they're not seeing the game (18:03 - 18:06)
associated with your face anymore (18:05 - 18:09)
they're seeing a new game it's weird (18:06 - 18:12)
yeah thinking about it now that's just (18:09 - 18:13)
putting it this way see if it's it's (18:12 - 18:16)
it's pretty weird knuckle eyes is really (18:13 - 18:20)
weird yeah that's that's that's the gist (18:16 - 18:22)
of them that's the story yeah it was (18:20 - 18:25)
gone so did you did you lose though did (18:22 - 18:27)
you lose that audience did you have a I (18:25 - 18:29)
imagine you said when you started from (18:27 - 18:31)
zero again but you know if they're not (18:29 - 18:33)
if they're not in a Pokemon they're not (18:31 - 18:36)
in a Pokemon okay so it has a strange (18:33 - 18:39)
effect on my channel my channel if you (18:36 - 18:42)
if you were to make a change like that (18:39 - 18:44)
now your channel is there's no the hype (18:42 - 18:47)
you will clearly notice it but because (18:44 - 18:48)
there are so many new people coming into (18:47 - 18:50)
the channel and checking out the videos (18:48 - 18:54)
I barely noticed me losing that initial (18:50 - 18:56)
audience but I think it's fair to say (18:54 - 18:58)
that less than 10% of that original (18:56 - 19:01)
viewer base is actually still watching (18:58 - 19:03)
my videos at this point Wow (19:01 - 19:06)
but that was that okay I'm backing up (19:03 - 19:08)
again lots of backing up in this episode (19:06 - 19:11)
it's fine that's fine well you we we all (19:08 - 19:14)
we all knew Pokemon go was coming so (19:11 - 19:16)
when when we got the initial I think we (19:14 - 19:19)
knew I don't know six eight months prior (19:16 - 19:21)
to it dropping that okay here it's gonna (19:19 - 19:23)
come the summer it's gonna be this big (19:21 - 19:25)
thing when you first heard that (19:23 - 19:27)
announcement did you think I want to get (19:25 - 19:30)
on that Pokemon go bandwagon or was it (19:27 - 19:32)
something that like no kind of right (19:30 - 19:34)
before you decided not at all it kind of (19:32 - 19:38)
caught me by surprise so I I was I I did (19:34 - 19:40)
say I did see the trainer drop on the (19:38 - 19:41)
day of itself because it was training on (19:40 - 19:43)
YouTube and everybody was sending it to (19:41 - 19:46)
me I was like whoa this is insane but I (19:43 - 19:49)
honestly have no idea how it was going (19:46 - 19:51)
to working that little in some way shape (19:49 - 19:55)
or form it kind of seemed to be good too (19:51 - 19:56)
good to be true and essentially it was (19:55 - 19:58)
like (19:56 - 20:00)
there's no denying that like the trailer (19:58 - 20:02)
was absolutely stunning but the actual (20:00 - 20:04)
experience was a little bit different (20:02 - 20:05)
but it just took stuck with me for a (20:04 - 20:07)
while then I I just kind of forgot about (20:05 - 20:11)
it and then I got a message from one of (20:07 - 20:12)
my friends on Facebook and he said hey (20:11 - 20:15)
geo uh spoken when go thing it dropped (20:12 - 20:17)
the air in Australia I was like Oh what (20:15 - 20:21)
are you serious I was just interested to (20:17 - 20:23)
see what it was gonna be like I never (20:21 - 20:25)
knew it was gonna be such a big thing (20:23 - 20:27)
now like I knew it was interesting I (20:25 - 20:30)
just didn't know how big it was gonna be (20:27 - 20:33)
I always kind of kicked myself because (20:30 - 20:34)
you know I've been doing this this (20:33 - 20:37)
Pokemon podcast for seven years and so I (20:34 - 20:39)
do everything Pokemon whether that's the (20:37 - 20:41)
card game the anime the video game you (20:39 - 20:43)
know magic harp jump whatever whatever (20:41 - 20:45)
Pokemon throws at me I'll try to cover (20:43 - 20:48)
it and so when go came out I was like (20:45 - 20:50)
great I'm gonna do you know I'm gonna do (20:48 - 20:52)
this miniseries just focusing and go you (20:50 - 20:54)
know that went as well as I could (20:52 - 20:56)
connect to the servers because of all (20:54 - 20:59)
those issues at the beginning yeah you (20:56 - 21:00)
know and I thought I definitely saw an (20:59 - 21:02)
uptick in listeners when when go came (21:00 - 21:07)
out just know no denying that but I had (21:02 - 21:09)
no expectations that it would hit the (21:07 - 21:11)
height that it did and I don't think (21:09 - 21:13)
anyone would have been able to predict (21:11 - 21:15)
that yeah because I think at least from (21:13 - 21:17)
your standing point I would imagine that (21:15 - 21:20)
you you think it would be like as if the (21:17 - 21:21)
new Pokemon game got released right (21:20 - 21:24)
right yeah so I definitely understand (21:21 - 21:27)
that yeah so it's like I could I (21:24 - 21:29)
could've did more but in and you know (21:27 - 21:31)
what it's whatever right you know I I (21:29 - 21:33)
continued talking about Pokemon I still (21:31 - 21:35)
love it there's that regret of like I (21:33 - 21:37)
could've did more but for you you did (21:35 - 21:41)
the first video and it took off and then (21:37 - 21:45)
you know you started doing more with (21:41 - 21:47)
athletic artists yeah oh that's that (21:45 - 21:48)
that first video is actually a (21:47 - 21:50)
livestream it's not even a video the (21:48 - 21:52)
first seven or eight videos were just (21:50 - 21:54)
live streams and there was one video in (21:52 - 21:56)
between which was like a recap of what I (21:54 - 21:58)
had done because I was just so busy (21:56 - 22:00)
playing the game the only thing that I (21:58 - 22:02)
was thinking like okay you know I should (22:00 - 22:05)
probably stream this because I'm just (22:02 - 22:06)
having too much fun playing the game I (22:05 - 22:10)
had no intention of going in doors to my (22:06 - 22:11)
home especially (22:10 - 22:13)
summer it was it was really hot at the (22:11 - 22:16)
time I had no intention of going back to (22:13 - 22:18)
my computer and added everything so it's (22:16 - 22:21)
like let's just you know do a stream and (22:18 - 22:24)
let's make that the video so that as (22:21 - 22:27)
lazy as it was that was the content (22:24 - 22:30)
really you do you're doing the Pokemon (22:27 - 22:34)
stuff that that's getting traction you I (22:30 - 22:36)
guess I'm curious at this point in in (22:34 - 22:38)
your YouTube career were you doing (22:36 - 22:40)
YouTube full-time or was that the (22:38 - 22:42)
Pokemon go stuff that pushed it over the (22:40 - 22:45)
edge for you um I was at the phase where (22:42 - 22:49)
my channel was growing it wasn't a (22:45 - 22:52)
growing face so I could already do you (22:49 - 22:55)
two full-time which I did the Pokemon (22:52 - 22:57)
pushed it over the edge to do it (22:55 - 23:01)
full-time without stressing about like (22:57 - 23:03)
having to retain my audience or anything (23:01 - 23:05)
like that that kind of came naturally (23:03 - 23:08)
so yeah what's already doing it (23:05 - 23:10)
full-time would became a little bit more (23:08 - 23:12)
comfortable to do so what made you (23:10 - 23:17)
decide to do YouTube as a career mm-hmm (23:12 - 23:20)
I don't know exactly when that when that (23:17 - 23:23)
decision was made I always saw YouTube (23:20 - 23:26)
as a part-time kind of thing I still (23:23 - 23:28)
remember I was looking for for a job in (23:26 - 23:30)
a mentorship function because my (23:28 - 23:32)
previous work before YouTube that mine (23:30 - 23:34)
you to come and started building and as (23:32 - 23:37)
I was like looking for a different job I (23:34 - 23:39)
just did this YouTube thing on the side (23:37 - 23:41)
because I noticed like hey this is one (23:39 - 23:44)
month I'm gonna earn 16 bucks and the (23:41 - 23:47)
next month it will be 26 so it would be (23:44 - 23:49)
kind of nice to have a little bit extra (23:47 - 23:52)
financially but it wasn't about the (23:49 - 23:54)
money at all it's just like oh hey this (23:52 - 23:57)
videos that I was making already I can (23:54 - 23:59)
get like a little bit of money from that (23:57 - 24:02)
so that that idea it struck something (23:59 - 24:03)
with me because it was like hey my work (24:02 - 24:06)
is meaningful in some way shape or form (24:03 - 24:08)
so from that perspective I started sort (24:06 - 24:10)
of building and I started you know (24:08 - 24:12)
creating content while I was still (24:10 - 24:14)
looking for a job but then I realized I (24:12 - 24:17)
enjoyed doing this video creation (24:14 - 24:20)
process I enjoyed it so much that I was (24:17 - 24:21)
like hey maybe this is something that I (24:20 - 24:24)
can pursue like full-time on a part-time (24:21 - 24:25)
basis so it (24:24 - 24:27)
still it would actually be a thing that (24:25 - 24:30)
I'll dedicate time to be true the Urmi (24:27 - 24:32)
money so it's essentially like a job but (24:30 - 24:34)
still do something on the side and after (24:32 - 24:37)
a while I just was like I honestly don't (24:34 - 24:40)
feel like looking for anything because (24:37 - 24:43)
it was really tough time at that moment (24:40 - 24:46)
2014 - to find a job for me because (24:43 - 24:48)
there was a lot of things happening in (24:46 - 24:50)
like looking for jobs since it was (24:48 - 24:53)
pretty hard to find something so I just (24:50 - 24:55)
started putting more focus and emphasis (24:53 - 24:57)
on youtube and yeah with enough (24:55 - 24:59)
navigation and hour hours put into it (24:57 - 25:01)
and staying consistent it actually look (24:59 - 25:03)
kind of like no got to a place where I (25:01 - 25:07)
am earning a full-time income I guess no (25:03 - 25:08)
no that won't make sense I want to bring (25:07 - 25:10)
up something a little controversial here (25:08 - 25:13)
clickbait mmm I've heard that your (25:10 - 25:16)
videos you know are more click baby than (25:13 - 25:19)
other Pokemon go people but you and (25:16 - 25:22)
other youtubers are so involved in the (25:19 - 25:23)
YouTube scene it's it's it's your life (25:22 - 25:25)
it's your job how do you feel when you (25:23 - 25:28)
know people say that or you know you (25:25 - 25:29)
come across that and you see nothing but (25:28 - 25:33)
thumbnails with arrows and and big X's (25:29 - 25:36)
and stuff like yeah is that just what (25:33 - 25:38)
you have to do to survive or where are (25:36 - 25:41)
your thoughts on that yes you'd have to (25:38 - 25:43)
do that to survive and it's kind of sad (25:41 - 25:47)
that YouTube has become that way you (25:43 - 25:50)
also believe I'm always real with this (25:47 - 25:52)
yes I do click they I think everybody (25:50 - 25:56)
that has some sort of you know audience (25:52 - 25:58)
click baits to a certain degree however (25:56 - 26:01)
I feel that mainstream click bait is (25:58 - 26:05)
misunderstood usually whenever a video (26:01 - 26:07)
has like arrows and stuff people (26:05 - 26:08)
essentially are like click bait but (26:07 - 26:11)
essentially it's just like you you only (26:08 - 26:16)
got so many moments on a viewer for them (26:11 - 26:19)
to get interested in your video so you (26:16 - 26:20)
need to come up with something that (26:19 - 26:22)
triggers the person to click on your (26:20 - 26:27)
video hands the bait but there's a thin (26:22 - 26:30)
line of Understanding between what is (26:27 - 26:33)
click bait and what is misleading and I (26:30 - 26:36)
don't think click bait is bad I mean I I (26:33 - 26:39)
notice it myself is if I see (26:36 - 26:40)
an asteroid or something like that or (26:39 - 26:42)
something that I'm personally interested (26:40 - 26:44)
in and then someone makes this stuff (26:42 - 26:47)
like the top 10 Pokemon that you never (26:44 - 26:49)
knew what special ability they have and (26:47 - 26:51)
you won't believe what number four is (26:49 - 26:54)
matters automatically like kind of (26:51 - 26:56)
interested to see hey what is that all (26:54 - 26:58)
about and if the information is (26:56 - 27:00)
disappointed is disappointing in their (26:58 - 27:03)
part then they automatically will have a (27:00 - 27:06)
negative idea towards that and that's (27:03 - 27:10)
her whole like perfection becomes a (27:06 - 27:12)
mainstream because more people become (27:10 - 27:14)
aware of what a clickbait actually is (27:12 - 27:18)
but I think it's still very gray what (27:14 - 27:20)
good click that is the one that drags (27:18 - 27:22)
you in and the issue with a feeling (27:20 - 27:24)
satisfaction and the one that makes you (27:22 - 27:26)
click on it and then you're like this is (27:24 - 27:28)
not even related to what the video is (27:26 - 27:30)
all about so yeah I see what you're (27:28 - 27:32)
saying yeah do you know do you notice (27:30 - 27:35)
though like a difference between video (27:32 - 27:38)
and video be if video be is is very (27:35 - 27:40)
click baby and you know title and (27:38 - 27:43)
thumbnail and video a is possibly the (27:40 - 27:45)
same if not better content but maybe you (27:43 - 27:48)
know doesn't have huge words or all caps (27:45 - 27:51)
or is there really a huge distinctive (27:48 - 27:54)
difference between the amount of use you (27:51 - 27:56)
get yeah there really is there really is (27:54 - 28:00)
the thing is a lot of people are are not (27:56 - 28:02)
in this whole YouTube scene like a lot (28:00 - 28:05)
of people are just watching it because (28:02 - 28:08)
they have a question like what I used to (28:05 - 28:10)
do I used to watch like walkthroughs (28:08 - 28:13)
like if I were to be playing games I (28:10 - 28:15)
would I would be getting stuck on a (28:13 - 28:18)
particular part of a game and I'd be (28:15 - 28:21)
like oh how do I get there so nowadays (28:18 - 28:24)
in 2017 the way it is it's like people (28:21 - 28:26)
understand that content creators and (28:24 - 28:28)
youtubers and search and they will play (28:26 - 28:32)
in on that question so if you're like (28:28 - 28:34)
hey how do I beat this gym leader in in (28:32 - 28:37)
Pokemon X&Y you got like a million of (28:34 - 28:39)
different types of result but the one (28:37 - 28:42)
that is speaking the most out there like (28:39 - 28:44)
the one with the most arrows and to (28:42 - 28:46)
something that points it out and really (28:44 - 28:48)
grabs your attention that can be a click (28:46 - 28:50)
baby video so yeah it's it's it's it's (28:48 - 28:52)
kind of interesting how that has changed (28:50 - 28:54)
from the way it used to be I mean I (28:52 - 28:56)
think that that's a question a lot of (28:54 - 28:58)
people ask I appreciate you answering it (28:56 - 29:01)
no it's fine it's I understand that (28:58 - 29:03)
people ask the question because I'll be (29:01 - 29:05)
the exact same but it's just like yeah (29:03 - 29:07)
we all do clickbait if someone tells me (29:05 - 29:09)
that they're no click bed and that (29:07 - 29:11)
that's honestly just a lie because we (29:09 - 29:15)
all as content creators try to get so (29:11 - 29:17)
many people in because it supports us in (29:15 - 29:20)
some way shape or form but it all comes (29:17 - 29:21)
down to the integrity of the youtuber (29:20 - 29:23)
it's very important to understand (29:21 - 29:26)
whether someone is doing it just for the (29:23 - 29:28)
views or someone really wants to get (29:26 - 29:30)
their content out there they're just you (29:28 - 29:32)
got like so many channels out there (29:30 - 29:34)
which you just only care for the money (29:32 - 29:37)
but have no integrity behind their (29:34 - 29:38)
YouTube channel because they only just (29:37 - 29:41)
want to get rich quickly I guess yeah (29:38 - 29:45)
yeah totally going back to we know we (29:41 - 29:46)
brought this up at the beginning of the (29:45 - 29:49)
the conversation but you know me meeting (29:46 - 29:52)
you at Pokemon go fast that day was such (29:49 - 29:54)
a blur in retrospect because of (29:52 - 29:57)
everything that was happening but what (29:54 - 29:59)
was what was your overall thoughts on (29:57 - 30:02)
Pokemon go fast I asked him that from a (29:59 - 30:04)
player perspective were you two're I (30:02 - 30:07)
mean I guess both you know I I (30:04 - 30:10)
originally went I had this game plan of (30:07 - 30:12)
hey I'm gonna get into the park early (30:10 - 30:13)
I'm gonna shoot some content and I (30:12 - 30:15)
normally don't shoot video of stuff I'm (30:13 - 30:18)
primarily an audio-only guy but my (30:15 - 30:20)
friend let me a camera so I stopped shot (30:18 - 30:23)
some video of the park early I was gonna (30:20 - 30:24)
you know meet with all the other media (30:23 - 30:26)
people try to get a couple of interviews (30:24 - 30:28)
and then I was actually gonna spend you (30:26 - 30:30)
know most of the day just playing the (30:28 - 30:31)
game and then you know shoot some more (30:30 - 30:33)
video at the end of the day especially (30:31 - 30:36)
one the six o'clock quote-unquote (30:33 - 30:37)
legendary event was supposed to happen (30:36 - 30:39)
and then you know continued playing for (30:37 - 30:41)
the night so my day plant my plan was (30:39 - 30:43)
you know get some video get some content (30:41 - 30:44)
that's gonna take you know two three (30:43 - 30:46)
hours of my day but then enjoy the rest (30:44 - 30:49)
of the day as a player and obviously (30:46 - 30:50)
that didn't that didn't turn out that (30:49 - 30:51)
well yeah (30:50 - 30:54)
but you know your thoughts so as a (30:51 - 30:56)
player I'm actually gonna justified it (30:54 - 31:00)
into some ways to you know make it more (30:56 - 31:01)
relatable as I do it on my channel I (31:00 - 31:03)
guess so as a player it was a complete (31:01 - 31:05)
disaster I'm not gonna lie about that it (31:03 - 31:05)
was (31:05 - 31:07)
an absolute disaster there's so many (31:05 - 31:10)
things that went wrong it was coming (31:07 - 31:12)
concerning for me early on whenever I (31:10 - 31:14)
got mail I got a notification on my (31:12 - 31:17)
phone I tried to open up my gmail and (31:14 - 31:19)
that took me two minutes us like there's (31:17 - 31:21)
something wrong here then I went to the (31:19 - 31:22)
media lounge and we have like separate (31:21 - 31:23)
wife are there and I tried connecting (31:22 - 31:26)
there and that kind of sort of worked I (31:23 - 31:27)
guess because it was like a dedicated (31:26 - 31:30)
Wi-Fi setting at the time I immediately (31:27 - 31:33)
knew oh this is an issue that is beyond (31:30 - 31:35)
my antic I feel because I cannot even (31:33 - 31:37)
connect to because there's so many (31:35 - 31:40)
people using the service itself then I (31:37 - 31:41)
was thinking like hey what can (31:40 - 31:44)
potentially cost that and the one thing (31:41 - 31:46)
that came to mind for me as a consumer (31:44 - 31:49)
was like hey I imagined it being New (31:46 - 31:52)
Year's Eve and it's about 12 o'clock and (31:49 - 31:54)
you're texting off your friends and (31:52 - 31:56)
making phone calls to wish everybody (31:54 - 31:58)
happy new year and you cannot do it (31:56 - 32:01)
because service is really slow and (31:58 - 32:04)
something so forth and then it struck me (32:01 - 32:07)
like hey everybody is trying to play (32:04 - 32:11)
this mobile game at the exact same time (32:07 - 32:13)
there's no way that this is ever going (32:11 - 32:14)
to be okay (32:13 - 32:17)
so when every whenever in the antic (32:14 - 32:19)
spoke to us about hey we're trying to (32:17 - 32:20)
fix this was like you guys are probably (32:19 - 32:22)
never going to be able to fix that today (32:20 - 32:24)
because it's just like it's a disaster (32:22 - 32:28)
this print came in got there hot spots (32:24 - 32:29)
made it definitely more bearable for (32:28 - 32:31)
spring users which was great but (32:29 - 32:33)
everybody else was having some issues (32:31 - 32:36)
especially on t-mobile and that was (32:33 - 32:38)
alright it was decent I could open up (32:36 - 32:42)
the app and my Pokemon GoPros device (32:38 - 32:44)
would notify me of a Pokemon being there (32:42 - 32:45)
and I could actually catch it but I (32:44 - 32:48)
couldn't visually see the Pokemon itself (32:45 - 32:50)
mm-hmm and then later that day what my (32:48 - 32:52)
auntie did which was very awesome is (32:50 - 32:54)
that they do you know the little (32:52 - 32:55)
animation on the lumo juice with the (32:54 - 32:58)
little pink Leafs (32:55 - 33:00)
yeah like the sparkles exactly they (32:58 - 33:04)
removed that because you know it it kind (33:00 - 33:06)
of put a strain on people's phones (33:04 - 33:09)
because the the the animation itself (33:06 - 33:10)
apparently in some way shape or form (33:09 - 33:12)
kind of effects the way you're playing (33:10 - 33:15)
and if it's very lag --is-- then you're (33:12 - 33:17)
you have a bad experience so they (33:15 - 33:18)
removed that and more people as a result (33:17 - 33:19)
were able (33:18 - 33:22)
play but they didn't go well at all the (33:19 - 33:26)
events it was a complete mess the (33:22 - 33:29)
compensation I feel was communicated in (33:26 - 33:33)
a poor way I think they they could have (33:29 - 33:35)
brought like the news earlier have a (33:33 - 33:37)
back-up plan just in case something (33:35 - 33:39)
would be going wrong I feel that the (33:37 - 33:43)
idea with the the radius of the events (33:39 - 33:45)
the distance where pokken will be (33:43 - 33:47)
popping up and the special actor will be (33:45 - 33:50)
there there was communicated a little (33:47 - 33:54)
bit clumsy so as a player I didn't (33:50 - 33:56)
really enjoy Pokemon go fast a whole lot (33:54 - 33:59)
but that's a content creator on YouTube (33:56 - 34:01)
it was the best day ever because it got (33:59 - 34:04)
to meet so many people so that's two (34:01 - 34:05)
stories there so I definitely understand (34:04 - 34:07)
that a lot of players were upset so easy (34:05 - 34:08)
to the core where some people would be (34:07 - 34:10)
leaving the park I think at the end of (34:08 - 34:13)
the day though my auntie came up with a (34:10 - 34:17)
better event like after the the the (34:13 - 34:20)
Pokemon office itself was was bad right (34:17 - 34:23)
yep but the event after go fast like the (34:20 - 34:25)
two days after Pokemon go fast were the (34:23 - 34:28)
best days was better than Pokemon go (34:25 - 34:30)
fast itself I feel because yep the (34:28 - 34:32)
legendaries the Holman percent catch (34:30 - 34:34)
rate and the event itself with the (34:32 - 34:38)
double experience extra starters the ACT (34:34 - 34:44)
distance which was cut in in 33% so it (34:38 - 34:46)
was it was terrific but it came a little (34:44 - 34:48)
bit too late I think a lot of people (34:46 - 34:51)
will remember Pokemon go fast for their (34:48 - 34:54)
failures and not how awesome it became (34:51 - 34:56)
after the actual event yeah yeah I (34:54 - 34:58)
completely agree with you I think I may (34:56 - 35:01)
be caught you know four or five Pokemon (34:58 - 35:04)
during the actual hours that poke my (35:01 - 35:07)
office is scheduled but afterwards oh I (35:04 - 35:11)
caught hundreds of Pokemon across a (35:07 - 35:15)
known III exactly I actually drove down (35:11 - 35:17)
that day I live about an hour and a half (35:15 - 35:20)
away and I had so much fun after 7 p.m. (35:17 - 35:22)
and since they extended the event I came (35:20 - 35:24)
back down on Sunday it's like I don't (35:22 - 35:26)
care how much parking is I want more (35:24 - 35:29)
Pokemon Co yeah how did you feel about (35:26 - 35:32)
like every I think you saw that maybe as (35:29 - 35:33)
well or maybe it is something (35:32 - 35:35)
that I'm going to tell you but literally (35:33 - 35:38)
every single lugia rate had 500 people (35:35 - 35:40)
standing there try like I'm not talking (35:38 - 35:42)
about the ones in their part but every (35:40 - 35:45)
single one of them oh yeah I loved it (35:42 - 35:48)
yeah it was crazy so yeah we great I (35:45 - 35:51)
will never forget that it's even crazier (35:48 - 35:53)
than when Pokemon go got started on a (35:51 - 35:55)
few yes yeah I wanted to run something (35:53 - 35:57)
by you I haven't talked about this on (35:55 - 35:58)
the podcast but I feel like this is a (35:57 - 36:00)
great great place to talk about it just (35:58 - 36:02)
because yeah you know you were at (36:00 - 36:04)
Pokemon go fast so I have a for again (36:02 - 36:06)
you know I'm not I'm not I'm not saying (36:04 - 36:09)
this is this is a hundred percent source (36:06 - 36:11)
I'm not saying that this is right I'm (36:09 - 36:12)
just you know throwing it out there and (36:11 - 36:14)
and would love to hear your thoughts but (36:12 - 36:15)
I have a friend who works at a corporate (36:14 - 36:19)
18 tea store and not at Pokemon go fast (36:15 - 36:21)
I shouldn't say store he works at (36:19 - 36:24)
corporate 18 tea right so I you know I (36:21 - 36:26)
told him about the day I told him that (36:24 - 36:28)
18 tea Wi-Fi worked fine I was able to (36:26 - 36:30)
connect to it at the mini Evette I'm on (36:28 - 36:33)
AT&T my girlfriend's on Sprint hers was (36:30 - 36:34)
off and on all day and we know that (36:33 - 36:36)
Sprint had a cow out there cow being (36:34 - 36:39)
cellular on wheels they had one oh I see (36:36 - 36:41)
but 18t verizon they refused to bring (36:39 - 36:44)
cows out but Sprint had one and then (36:41 - 36:47)
there were pretty much no one could (36:44 - 36:49)
connect now on top of no one could (36:47 - 36:51)
connecting no one could really even make (36:49 - 36:52)
phone calls (36:51 - 36:54)
I tried calling somebody on Sprint on 18 (36:52 - 36:57)
T on US Cellular I could barely get (36:54 - 36:59)
through and if the call did connect it (36:57 - 37:01)
was a lot of like hello hello hello like (36:59 - 37:08)
I could hear each other saying hello my (37:01 - 37:10)
my friend at AT&T said you know (37:08 - 37:13)
Lollapalooza lots of big events take (37:10 - 37:16)
place at Grant Park and so AT&T is aware (37:13 - 37:18)
of the foot traffic that Grant Park (37:16 - 37:21)
brings in and because and he said that (37:18 - 37:24)
because calls couldn't even be made that (37:21 - 37:26)
there that that led to something more (37:24 - 37:28)
that people aren't talking about because (37:26 - 37:31)
apparently data the data network and the (37:28 - 37:33)
phone call network are completely (37:31 - 37:34)
different networks that don't interact (37:33 - 37:36)
with each other so even if your data is (37:34 - 37:37)
completely busted you should be able to (37:36 - 37:40)
still make a phone call he is he is (37:37 - 37:42)
confident and again you know who's to (37:40 - 37:44)
say he is confident that knee antic (37:42 - 37:47)
tried to put out something again (37:44 - 37:50)
the cellular network in terms to prevent (37:47 - 37:52)
spoof errs and because they did that (37:50 - 37:55)
that is what actually caused the network (37:52 - 37:58)
to fail and could never recover oh wow (37:55 - 38:01)
okay this is a big one and I thought (37:58 - 38:02)
that was really interesting especially (38:01 - 38:05)
yeah when I went down on Sunday night (38:02 - 38:07)
that that whole park was still a dead (38:05 - 38:08)
zone there were no there was no one (38:07 - 38:10)
there and I still couldn't get service (38:08 - 38:13)
yeah I noticed I noticed something like (38:10 - 38:15)
that I was the day after I was (38:13 - 38:19)
incredibly sick I will state the sick in (38:15 - 38:21)
my hotel until six o'clock in the (38:19 - 38:23)
evening where I finally decide I need to (38:21 - 38:25)
get out get some fresh air because I've (38:23 - 38:27)
been in bed all day and eventually you (38:25 - 38:29)
start to feel uncomfortable and kind of (38:27 - 38:31)
need to get out so the weather was (38:29 - 38:34)
coming nice and just figure I need to go (38:31 - 38:37)
outside and then close to the park there (38:34 - 38:39)
were a couple of legendary raids and I (38:37 - 38:41)
attempted to do them but I just couldn't (38:39 - 38:44)
get in I could get in but I would get (38:41 - 38:46)
Network error or I would disconnect and (38:44 - 38:49)
I would restart the app and it took (38:46 - 38:51)
forever and then in other parts I could (38:49 - 38:53)
play normally so it was almost like it (38:51 - 38:55)
just like a block or two away it worked (38:53 - 38:58)
perfect yeah yeah exactly and I thought (38:55 - 39:01)
that was strange but now that you're (38:58 - 39:02)
saying that they could might as well (39:01 - 39:04)
been in that case for sure (39:02 - 39:07)
which which is really weird when you (39:04 - 39:08)
think about it because they already (39:07 - 39:12)
extended the reach of the event so I (39:08 - 39:14)
don't understand why that would still be (39:12 - 39:18)
there at the park itself and and I (39:14 - 39:19)
thought the QR code was a good solution (39:18 - 39:22)
get there scan the QR code okay now you (39:19 - 39:25)
can play and there were there were leaks (39:22 - 39:27)
of some QR codes and obviously that (39:25 - 39:29)
would that would draw spoofer to the (39:27 - 39:33)
event but the the the mindset of nee (39:29 - 39:35)
antek putting out something to prevent (39:33 - 39:38)
spoof errs does make sense and but again (39:35 - 39:40)
it doesn't make sense that they were if (39:38 - 39:41)
they were locking the content behind the (39:40 - 39:44)
QR code but I mean I I could see them (39:41 - 39:45)
doing it I'm not saying that's that (39:44 - 39:47)
that's a hundred percent what happened (39:45 - 39:49)
but it is when you look at Sunday night (39:47 - 39:51)
24 hours after the event and that area (39:49 - 39:53)
was still a dead zone that just doesn't (39:51 - 39:55)
make sense for from a network (39:53 - 39:58)
perspective yeah it doesn't and I (39:55 - 40:00)
honestly feel that I am (39:58 - 40:03)
should have had better contacts I don't (40:00 - 40:04)
know what happens beyond disease I've (40:03 - 40:07)
just been invited as a special guest (40:04 - 40:08)
with the other youtubers and people from (40:07 - 40:11)
media to attend Ethan but I in no way (40:08 - 40:14)
shape or form know what's happening that (40:11 - 40:16)
then was just explored of my antique or (40:14 - 40:19)
any of the context that they're having (40:16 - 40:21)
some also just speculating in that (40:19 - 40:24)
aspect but a few base of what I've heard (40:21 - 40:26)
that Niantic should have had better (40:24 - 40:30)
contact with AT&T did things went well (40:26 - 40:33)
with Sprint but seeing that only Sprint (40:30 - 40:36)
came out with their cow and got that (40:33 - 40:38)
connection up a little bit better tells (40:36 - 40:41)
me something that you know could things (40:38 - 40:43)
could have been better just on the (40:41 - 40:46)
community out the communication aspect (40:43 - 40:48)
or is the other natural providers for (40:46 - 40:52)
sure yeah yeah let's shift gears a (40:48 - 40:54)
little bit to an event that seems to be (40:52 - 40:57)
pretty successful the Pokemon go safari (40:54 - 41:00)
event that's happening in Europe right (40:57 - 41:04)
now and it's weird it's a weird one tell (41:00 - 41:05)
me about that what it what is that like (41:04 - 41:07)
because I feel like everyone here in in (41:05 - 41:09)
America even if they didn't go to (41:07 - 41:11)
Pokemon go fest they knew a hundred (41:09 - 41:13)
percent of what happened what it was (41:11 - 41:14)
like what they missed what they didn't (41:13 - 41:17)
miss and I feel like I'm kind of in the (41:14 - 41:19)
dark with the with the Europe event like (41:17 - 41:22)
what is actually going on there okay it (41:19 - 41:27)
is so it's good that you're speaking me (41:22 - 41:28)
about that because I've been through the (41:27 - 41:30)
safari zone myself and I live in Europe (41:28 - 41:34)
it is canceled or postponed what you're (41:30 - 41:37)
seeing right now safari zone Europe is (41:34 - 41:40)
not the actual safari zone but it's kind (41:37 - 41:43)
of like a suede Oh Safari Sun is not the (41:40 - 41:45)
real Safari Zone but it has like traits (41:43 - 41:48)
of it right now in Europe you have the (41:45 - 41:52)
capability in select cities and we need (41:48 - 41:54)
to back up a little bit before I get to (41:52 - 41:56)
that so Niantic has a partnership with a (41:54 - 41:59)
bunch of moss and the mall company is (41:56 - 42:03)
called unibrow Tomko and they have malls (41:59 - 42:07)
all across Europe make mostly in big (42:03 - 42:10)
cities like Copenhagen Paris Berlin (42:07 - 42:13)
Amsterdam Stockholm Oslo like they got (42:10 - 42:14)
all these (42:13 - 42:16)
big cities covered with a mall and the (42:14 - 42:18)
mall itself is actually kind of like a (42:16 - 42:21)
four star ish mall it's like a little (42:18 - 42:23)
bit more extravagant like a little bit (42:21 - 42:25)
more luxurious you have an expensive (42:23 - 42:27)
stores ton little fanciest what I was (42:25 - 42:31)
looking for so they got these and (42:27 - 42:32)
because everybody knows these malls are (42:31 - 42:36)
pretty expensive I feel they they have (42:32 - 42:37)
this partnership and they have this (42:36 - 42:39)
partnership already with ingress which (42:37 - 42:42)
is the predecessor of Pokemon go to (42:39 - 42:45)
deploy polka stops at these locations (42:42 - 42:49)
and the density of these polka stops is (42:45 - 42:53)
quite insane I'm talking about over 20 (42:49 - 42:55)
focus stops within one mall of which you (42:53 - 42:58)
can reach five six seven or sometimes (42:55 - 43:00)
even eight while standing in one (42:58 - 43:01)
location (43:00 - 43:03)
that's the craziness we're talking about (43:01 - 43:07)
here yeah so obviously then knowing that (43:03 - 43:10)
players knowing that they come flocking (43:07 - 43:12)
to these locations and myself included (43:10 - 43:13)
up into Denmark have been to Stockholm (43:12 - 43:16)
I've been to Amsterdam and I've been to (43:13 - 43:18)
Germany very recently and I will be (43:16 - 43:19)
coming back there a couple of times (43:18 - 43:21)
because the place is honestly too good (43:19 - 43:24)
to play out but the way they got it set (43:21 - 43:26)
up right now know now that this is all (43:24 - 43:28)
advertised and these models are there (43:26 - 43:30)
and everybody knows that these moths are (43:28 - 43:33)
there the safari zone itself the event (43:30 - 43:34)
was going to be happening on the 5th and (43:33 - 43:37)
the 12th of August and there was going (43:34 - 43:39)
to be another event at the 16th of (43:37 - 43:41)
September the 5th of August and 12th of (43:39 - 43:44)
August have been postponed until later (43:41 - 43:46)
date which is right now unknown so what (43:44 - 43:50)
they've done alternatively is they have (43:46 - 43:54)
deployed Genghis Khan and unknowns at (43:50 - 43:57)
these locations and now they have (43:54 - 44:00)
extended the radius by 25 miles or 40 (43:57 - 44:02)
kilometers it is not the real safari (44:00 - 44:04)
zone yet all these just these extra (44:02 - 44:07)
special spawns which already so cool (44:04 - 44:08)
because Genghis Khan obviously is the (44:07 - 44:11)
Australian hmm the Oceania reaching (44:08 - 44:13)
exclusive and that's now available in (44:11 - 44:16)
Europe and we already know how tough it (44:13 - 44:17)
is to catch an unknown in the Wow (44:16 - 44:19)
because it's the rarest Pokemon (44:17 - 44:22)
so those Pokemon are they're very (44:19 - 44:25)
commonly and the actual safari zone is (44:22 - 44:27)
gonna look something like pokemon go (44:25 - 44:30)
fast and that event that scored yapping (44:27 - 44:33)
in Japan Pokemon play park mm-hmm where (44:30 - 44:35)
there's going to be special raids (44:33 - 44:37)
there's going to be team lounges there's (44:35 - 44:39)
going to be an increased spawn of (44:37 - 44:41)
particular Pokemon but we don't know (44:39 - 44:43)
anything about else but that that's (44:41 - 44:45)
going to be happening so we have to see (44:43 - 44:48)
about that so in Chicago the unknown (44:45 - 44:52)
spelled Chicago and you you said that (44:48 - 44:54)
the unknown spell you're up there but (44:52 - 44:55)
you also said I believe on Twitter too (44:54 - 44:57)
that you're seeing other letters is that (44:55 - 45:00)
true still yeah so that's that's (44:57 - 45:02)
actually true I was there at the mall I (45:00 - 45:03)
haven't seen it myself but I've seen it (45:02 - 45:06)
on people's accounts that they called (45:03 - 45:08)
different types of unknowns other than (45:06 - 45:11)
the ones in Europe so my understanding (45:08 - 45:14)
or my theory behind this is that they (45:11 - 45:17)
also upped the response of other letters (45:14 - 45:20)
of a nun's so I are you in the position (45:17 - 45:21)
where you're just missing all the (45:20 - 45:25)
letters now at this point yeah I'm (45:21 - 45:28)
missing that's the last Pokemon they (45:25 - 45:30)
need well besides that besides the rest (45:28 - 45:33)
of the unknown dollars but just yeah I'm (45:30 - 45:37)
missing I'm missing one Pokemon and then (45:33 - 45:38)
you probably see you I miss a giraffe (45:37 - 45:41)
Rick you're missing giraffe rig yeah oh (45:38 - 45:45)
man if you're Milwaukee I will I would (45:41 - 45:48)
spot you exactly where traffic just pop (45:45 - 45:50)
up everywhere yeah but that's not the (45:48 - 45:52)
fun part is it that's not the fun thing (45:50 - 45:54)
that's not that's not the Pokemon go (45:52 - 45:55)
away to flag and that's what I (45:54 - 45:57)
personally feel for me I don't need to (45:55 - 45:59)
get it out of nag which is a (45:57 - 46:01)
five-kilometer egg I need to quints (45:59 - 46:03)
identity just run into it like I see it (46:01 - 46:05)
on my nearby and I'm like oh that's (46:03 - 46:07)
where I'm going but I don't want to (46:05 - 46:10)
specifically go to location just because (46:07 - 46:11)
happen to be there it is to find a (46:10 - 46:13)
Pokemon in my Dax yeah (46:11 - 46:15)
and of course lies still need of course (46:13 - 46:17)
as the region exclusive sure sure yeah (46:15 - 46:19)
so that's interesting that you don't (46:17 - 46:21)
seek out Pokemon I I felt like that I (46:19 - 46:23)
was that way for a while but with (46:21 - 46:25)
Pokemon go fest leading up I started (46:23 - 46:27)
using maps like Silk Road or you know (46:25 - 46:29)
Jim hunter all these resources out there (46:27 - 46:32)
you know to pinpoint certain things you (46:29 - 46:35)
have a pretty hard stance on spoof errs (46:32 - 46:37)
and and I completely agree with you but (46:35 - 46:39)
where are you coming from with that with (46:37 - 46:40)
people that you know are in Europe (46:39 - 46:41)
trying to (46:40 - 46:44)
to America they get tauros or you know (46:41 - 46:46)
PD and Australia trying to get far like (46:44 - 46:48)
where where's your stance on that there (46:46 - 46:50)
are better games like the actual Pokemon (46:48 - 46:53)
games to play if you're gonna play (46:50 - 46:56)
pokemon go to spoof cuz if you think (46:53 - 46:58)
about it boku isn't a whole lot of fun (46:56 - 47:01)
if you're gonna spoof there's a better (46:58 - 47:03)
gym system in the actual Pokemon games (47:01 - 47:06)
you can PvP in Pokemon games you can (47:03 - 47:08)
catch every single Pokemon Pokemon games (47:06 - 47:10)
I don't see what's so fun like the whole (47:08 - 47:13)
idea behind Pokemon go and that is of (47:10 - 47:15)
course to interpret before it is for (47:13 - 47:17)
everybody it's everybody else it's (47:15 - 47:20)
different of course but what I feel (47:17 - 47:23)
based off what my community tells me is (47:20 - 47:26)
that Pokemon goes is seen as a game that (47:23 - 47:29)
you play on the go when you go outside (47:26 - 47:32)
and actually play it but if you are at (47:29 - 47:34)
home and you're gonna go you're you type (47:32 - 47:37)
in your coordinates and you snipe to (47:34 - 47:39)
that location and then you get that (47:37 - 47:42)
Pokemon there is no feeling of (47:39 - 47:44)
satisfaction from doing something like (47:42 - 47:49)
that so it's also it you also if you are (47:44 - 47:51)
going to spoof there's two other things (47:49 - 47:54)
that are also to be considered or three (47:51 - 47:57)
the first thing is that other players (47:54 - 47:59)
that are playing the game legitimately (47:57 - 48:02)
get annoyed by the fact that some of (47:59 - 48:04)
these players do show off on Twitter and (48:02 - 48:05)
they're like hey I caught this Pokemon (48:04 - 48:07)
yeah what is the point you didn't go out (48:05 - 48:10)
and get it and then they're also slowing (48:07 - 48:14)
down my antics resources because we're (48:10 - 48:16)
new auntie could use these manpower you (48:14 - 48:19)
could use this manpower to put that in (48:16 - 48:21)
development or making the game better (48:19 - 48:24)
but scoopers are doing is making sure (48:21 - 48:26)
that Niantic has to focus some of that (48:24 - 48:29)
energy and time into taking making sure (48:26 - 48:31)
that spoofs got taken now so it has like (48:29 - 48:33)
a very negative effect to it and i feel (48:31 - 48:36)
that as a waste because Niantic and (48:33 - 48:38)
pokemon go is not perfect there's so (48:36 - 48:40)
many things still that can be improved (48:38 - 48:43)
in the game and until pokemon goes to (48:40 - 48:44)
game which is still pretty much a (48:43 - 48:47)
project in development I feel that (48:44 - 48:50)
school first is just like making sure (48:47 - 48:53)
that this goes like down really slow (48:50 - 48:54)
especially like in the beginning with (48:53 - 48:55)
the server (48:54 - 48:57)
and stuff so that's why my stance on (48:55 - 48:59)
spoofing is so harsh because I feel (48:57 - 49:02)
there's no excuse for a spoofing and (48:59 - 49:07)
that stands got even harsher after (49:02 - 49:09)
meeting people in wheelchairs disabled (49:07 - 49:11)
people people are that are sick people (49:09 - 49:12)
after that of certain diseases (49:11 - 49:16)
that still enjoyed the game playing (49:12 - 49:20)
Pokemon go by going outside so it's like (49:16 - 49:22)
of course no but not everybody's gonna (49:20 - 49:24)
agree with that stance of mine but (49:22 - 49:26)
that's what I feel Pokemon goes all (49:24 - 49:28)
about and that's you know you just (49:26 - 49:30)
making enough fun for yourself I guess (49:28 - 49:32)
ya know I completely agree with you I (49:30 - 49:34)
with pretty much every Pokemon of my (49:32 - 49:36)
pokedex I remember catching like my (49:34 - 49:38)
first I remember doing my first raid (49:36 - 49:40)
which I think was like a bay leaf raid I (49:38 - 49:43)
remember you know catching lugia for the (49:40 - 49:45)
first time I remember finding a wild (49:43 - 49:47)
needle Queen for the first time at like (49:45 - 49:49)
2:00 a.m. when I was at look at Denny's (49:47 - 49:52)
like I remember so many captures in (49:49 - 49:55)
Pokemon go that sometimes the main game (49:52 - 49:57)
doesn't make me feel that which is a (49:55 - 50:00)
little disheartening but you know if my (49:57 - 50:01)
friends in Hawaii and says oh I see a (50:00 - 50:03)
course he'll give me your login to me (50:01 - 50:06)
it's like what's the point like I don't (50:03 - 50:08)
get to experience that joy of finally (50:06 - 50:11)
seeing corsola for the first time yes (50:08 - 50:11)
exactly (50:11 - 50:14)
and I'm and just for the record I've (50:11 - 50:16)
never given anyone my login I'm (50:14 - 50:18)
definitely against movie huh yeah it's (50:16 - 50:21)
exactly what you said it's just that (50:18 - 50:23)
experience of going out and doing it I (50:21 - 50:25)
think there's a lot of value to that and (50:23 - 50:27)
you know maybe not everyone sees that (50:25 - 50:30)
value mm-hmm well I don't want to keep (50:27 - 50:32)
too much more of your time but I do want (50:30 - 50:34)
to end with with one one more question (50:32 - 50:37)
here so with as big as Pokemon go is and (50:34 - 50:38)
obviously it's like the biggest part of (50:37 - 50:40)
your life right now that that partnered (50:38 - 50:42)
with your YouTube career does that make (50:40 - 50:45)
you want to do more Pokemon stuff (50:42 - 50:47)
whether that's other iOS games and (50:45 - 50:49)
others Pokemon duel Magikarp jump (50:47 - 50:52)
there's the ultra Sun and ultra moon (50:49 - 50:54)
coming later this November you know (50:52 - 50:56)
there's the new movie coming out in (50:54 - 50:59)
November this is reigniting your love (50:56 - 51:02)
for pokemon wants you to expand and and (50:59 - 51:05)
get into the other parts of the (51:02 - 51:08)
franchise scallop itself question (51:05 - 51:08)
you're not taking up too (51:08 - 51:10)
much of my time no worries about that I (51:08 - 51:14)
don't know to be completely honest it's (51:10 - 51:16)
kind of a weird one a Magikarp jump I (51:14 - 51:18)
play I streamed it a couple of times it (51:16 - 51:20)
is too much of a kooky cookie clicker (51:18 - 51:23)
time game so I I do started up from time (51:20 - 51:26)
to time to kill some time if I'm waiting (51:23 - 51:27)
for if I'm waiting in the bus or (51:26 - 51:30)
something like that I open it up so that (51:27 - 51:33)
is kind of cool I guess uh and then (51:30 - 51:36)
sometimes I do play pokemon shuffle (51:33 - 51:38)
which I still very much enjoy the kids (51:36 - 51:40)
actually really great it really is like (51:38 - 51:44)
the moment I got the very first time I I (51:40 - 51:48)
was kind of hooked so those kind of (51:44 - 51:50)
games really keep my interest I try (51:48 - 51:51)
Pokemon do but it's really not my cup of (51:50 - 51:55)
tea because it's so it's so orangey it's (51:51 - 51:58)
so random so that that's not really my (51:55 - 52:01)
topic game but some people might you (51:58 - 52:03)
know fight me on that but it's just like (52:01 - 52:06)
I just don't like the the chance aspect (52:03 - 52:08)
of it there's too much chance I feel (52:06 - 52:11)
that that will be thrown at you with (52:08 - 52:14)
Pokemon too but one game in particular (52:11 - 52:18)
that I'm looking forward to a lot is (52:14 - 52:21)
Pokemon for the Nintendo switch and (52:18 - 52:24)
undoubtely whenever that gets released I (52:21 - 52:25)
will (52:24 - 52:26)
I think offer that on my youtube channel (52:25 - 52:29)
yeah but no it no interest in office (52:26 - 52:29)
ultramoon (52:29 - 52:33)
IIF I am interested in that I just feel (52:29 - 52:37)
that there are I feel a little bit (52:33 - 52:39)
intimidated if that makes any sense I (52:37 - 52:42)
feel a little bit intimidated by (52:39 - 52:44)
covering the main Pokemon games on my (52:42 - 52:46)
channel because there are channels out (52:44 - 52:48)
there which are so successful and so (52:46 - 52:50)
much more knowledgeable than I than I am (52:48 - 52:54)
in covering that game that I think it's (52:50 - 52:55)
better for me to stick to my roots (52:54 - 52:58)
seeing as that game I'm not exactly it's (52:55 - 53:00)
coming around the corner right it's (52:58 - 53:02)
getting there pretty soon and yeah it's (53:00 - 53:04)
just like I will play the game and I'll (53:02 - 53:05)
follow everything that's happening (53:04 - 53:09)
around the game but seeing as I feel how (53:05 - 53:11)
Sun and Moon themselves were pretty (53:09 - 53:13)
underwhelming I don't know if I want to (53:11 - 53:16)
really cover ultra so note (53:13 - 53:19)
I actually actually lied I do have one (53:16 - 53:21)
more question so sure you've been doing (53:19 - 53:24)
this for over a year now eventually (53:21 - 53:26)
we'll give up Pokemon go eventually (53:24 - 53:29)
we'll get gen 3 Gen 4 Jan will you you (53:26 - 53:30)
know knee antic said they want to do (53:29 - 53:33)
they want to do every generation yes do (53:30 - 53:35)
you feel that it's gonna be difficult to (53:33 - 53:39)
keep doing the content you are doing and (53:35 - 53:41)
I mean what I mean by that is do you (53:39 - 53:44)
think it'll ever get stale or to say me (53:41 - 53:47)
because adding more Pokemon to the game (53:44 - 53:50)
doesn't really change it undoubtely on (53:47 - 53:52)
that was oh yeah but like I guess like I (53:50 - 53:54)
guess to sum up that whole question the (53:52 - 53:55)
question would be how how are you gonna (53:54 - 53:59)
stay relevant with Pokemon go because it (53:55 - 54:02)
doesn't change that much you know for (53:59 - 54:02)
month to month (54:02 - 54:05)
yeah that's kind of a tough question to (54:02 - 54:10)
to answer I guess the best way to answer (54:05 - 54:11)
that question would be as long as I (54:10 - 54:15)
enjoy it myself and I'm able to provide (54:11 - 54:17)
content that I'm happy with that I'm (54:15 - 54:19)
proud of something that I've always been (54:17 - 54:21)
doing I don't think I'll have too much (54:19 - 54:24)
trouble and I guess staying relevant is (54:21 - 54:26)
not really the right word for it because (54:24 - 54:29)
I'm not looking to stay relevant or be (54:26 - 54:30)
relevant in any way shape or form like (54:29 - 54:34)
if if all the the the people that would (54:30 - 54:36)
like to get an autograph or self you (54:34 - 54:38)
would fall away but I will still have (54:36 - 54:40)
the capability of making videos hey I'm (54:38 - 54:42)
all for that (54:40 - 54:44)
so I'm not necessarily super looking to (54:42 - 54:46)
be or stay relevant but I just want to (54:44 - 54:50)
make videos that that I would personally (54:46 - 54:52)
enjoy and I still got so much more to do (54:50 - 54:54)
with Pokemon go that I don't think that (54:52 - 54:56)
the journey will be ending anytime soon (54:54 - 54:58)
there's still so many places to visit as (54:56 - 55:00)
well so we'll have to see about that (54:58 - 55:03)
it's gonna be interesting to see what my (55:00 - 55:05)
anti comes up with next but there has (55:03 - 55:08)
been instances which gave which gives me (55:05 - 55:12)
hope that Niantic will come up with (55:08 - 55:14)
something that's interesting and I mean (55:12 - 55:17)
if Pokemon girls not gonna be it then (55:14 - 55:19)
I'm pretty sure that in the near future (55:17 - 55:21)
there will be other AR gangs which will (55:19 - 55:24)
allow you to go outside which will which (55:21 - 55:26)
will make it equally as interesting as (55:24 - 55:29)
well awesome thank you so much reversal (55:26 - 55:29)
