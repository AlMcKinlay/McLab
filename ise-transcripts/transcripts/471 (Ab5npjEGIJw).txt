podcast it's super effective i'm i (0:35 - 0:39)
literally looked at our ad copy for the (0:37 - 0:44)
week which said what episode it was (0:39 - 0:46)
ruined it because the premium people (0:44 - 0:48)
aren't even supposed to know that ads (0:46 - 0:48)
exist (0:48 - 0:51)
and now you've let them behind them (0:48 - 0:52)
bummer (0:51 - 0:55)
uh i'm your host spj with me is greg (0:52 - 0:58)
hello i am back from my wildlife rescue (0:55 - 0:59)
morning (0:58 - 1:02)
we found a poor injured baby bunny in (0:59 - 1:03)
our yard last night (1:02 - 1:04)
and we're like oh well we'll do the (1:03 - 1:06)
thing where you leave it overnight (1:04 - 1:07)
because maybe the mom will come (1:06 - 1:10)
mom didn't come so we scooped up bunny (1:07 - 1:12)
and went to the wildlife (1:10 - 1:14)
rehabilitation center this morning and (1:12 - 1:15)
dropped a little bun (1:14 - 1:18)
off to get it get get all fixed forest (1:15 - 1:19)

rat that we took out to the (1:21 - 1:27)
jesus or something i've got like eight (1:24 - 1:30)
bunny rabbits in my backyard i took i (1:27 - 1:32)

happened when i went to my pokemon snap (1:32 - 1:39)
look i i i live in a green city (1:35 - 1:42)
i have a yard and we have bunnies and (1:39 - 1:43)
we're pretty sure that (1:42 - 1:47)
wherever the bunny (1:43 - 1:50)
home was one of the many feral cats in (1:47 - 1:51)
our neighborhood decided to do a (1:50 - 1:52)
midnight raid (1:51 - 1:56)
and they all fleed because our little (1:52 - 1:57)
bun was (1:56 - 2:00)
clearly clearly had been bit by (1:57 - 2:00)
something and (2:00 - 2:03)
pretty sure it wasn't our dogs um (2:00 - 2:05)
because they're they they don't like it (2:03 - 2:06)
when they scream (2:05 - 2:09)
back the animals supposed to just roll (2:06 - 2:10)

and italian and marnie and grimsnarl are (6:29 - 6:34)
on pokemon masters (6:32 - 6:35)
we didn't talk about this last week (6:34 - 6:38)
because it was uh pre-recorded (6:35 - 6:41)
um the two gala region sick pears are (6:38 - 6:41)
here (6:41 - 6:45)
to see the best restaurant in beachside (6:41 - 6:47)
rival there's a new story event it's (6:45 - 6:50)
called beachside rivalry (6:47 - 6:50)
look none of this matters the only thing (6:50 - 6:53)
that matters is they add my boy grimsnyr (6:51 - 6:54)
all to the game (6:53 - 6:57)
and i love grim snarl uh i don't really (6:54 - 6:58)
needed (6:57 - 6:59)
marnie to be in a swimsuit to have (6:58 - 7:02)
grimstar but (6:59 - 7:04)
in a swimsuit it is a it is a pleasant (7:02 - 7:05)
top (7:04 - 7:09)
and a skirt bottom they're like (7:05 - 7:11)
swimsuit beachy theme do you wear it (7:09 - 7:12)
with a beach theme but (7:11 - 7:15)
i mean i would not swim in that outfit (7:12 - 7:16)
you get dragged under (7:15 - 7:18)
no one's actually swimming when they go (7:16 - 7:20)
to the beach they're laying in the sand (7:18 - 7:22)
you get too hot you know you get (7:20 - 7:24)
rip-tide and then you're gone (7:22 - 7:28)
forever you can't trust that water (7:24 - 7:30)
it pulls you right under and you're gone (7:28 - 7:32)
this spoken by person who can't swim and (7:30 - 7:34)
thus has never swung (7:32 - 7:38)
things like that yeah (7:34 - 7:41)
it's not an ocean but not all oceans (7:38 - 7:43)
have riptides this is not how logic (7:41 - 7:45)
works yeah well (7:43 - 7:47)
there are pokemon who have attacks (7:45 - 7:48)
underneath it they're gonna (7:47 - 7:52)
drag you in take it did you pull on (7:48 - 7:53)
these greg (7:52 - 7:56)
uh i only pulled on marnie cause the two (7:53 - 7:57)
year (7:56 - 8:00)
is coming up so i wanted to save my gems (7:57 - 8:01)
oh that makes sense that makes sense (8:00 - 8:03)
yeah i didn't really spend any gems for (8:01 - 8:05)
most of june and july i was gonna pull (8:03 - 8:06)
on mass royale and then that came and (8:05 - 8:08)
went because yep (8:06 - 8:09)
i've been busy so at least i've been (8:08 - 8:11)
collecting my gems and i was gonna pull (8:09 - 8:13)
on ingo and emmett and (8:11 - 8:16)
that came and went and hey i got i got (8:13 - 8:17)
lots of gems i'm sitting on so (8:16 - 8:18)
sometime this week i'm gonna pull on (8:17 - 8:20)
marnie for sure just marnie i don't (8:18 - 8:22)
really care too much about gloria i just (8:20 - 8:24)
want grim snarl (8:22 - 8:26)
and i do want both look i want both (8:24 - 8:28)
that's the reality the reality is though (8:26 - 8:30)
that the two year anniversary is coming (8:28 - 8:31)
up i haven't saved gems (8:30 - 8:34)
i need to save jim sue uh i (8:31 - 8:38)
did get the grim snarl oh you did (8:34 - 8:41)
yeah first one i said i'm (8:38 - 8:41)
both it's dark first though (8:41 - 8:47)
oh okay i thought masters only has one (8:45 - 8:49)
type no it has the two now because it (8:47 - 8:51)
shows the dark and then the (8:49 - 8:53)
the fairy because it it will count if (8:51 - 8:55)
it's got moves of that type (8:53 - 8:58)
oh okay i missed something then uh (8:55 - 9:00)
there's also a fossil event happening (8:58 - 9:04)
in masters and that ties into (9:00 - 9:05)
other fossil events and other games and (9:04 - 9:08)
we'll circle back to that i want to get (9:05 - 9:10)
the you know i wanted to get the masters (9:08 - 9:11)
news out of the way (9:10 - 9:13)
at first because you questioned my you (9:11 - 9:15)
questioned me and i have to see (9:13 - 9:17)
yeah you can double check uh okay let's (9:15 - 9:19)
talk about pokemon unite (9:17 - 9:20)
uh we'll just get right into it i just (9:19 - 9:22)
wanted to get the masters out of the way (9:20 - 9:27)
this is off uh unite.pokemon.com (9:22 - 9:29)
unite is now available on the nintendo (9:27 - 9:30)
switch (9:29 - 9:38)
uh it says that yeah it's dark fairy (9:30 - 9:38)
uh the game is available for the (9:39 - 9:43)
nintendo e on the nintendo eshop for no (9:40 - 9:46)
cost if you download it by august 31st (9:43 - 9:46)
you will receive (9:46 - 9:49)
zera auras unite license to help on your (9:46 - 9:51)
quest for victory (9:49 - 9:53)
by battling in the first season of unite (9:51 - 9:55)
you will find essential items that will (9:53 - 9:56)
help you achieve success in future (9:55 - 9:58)
battles battling frequently will also (9:56 - 9:59)
raise your battle pass (9:58 - 10:02)
level which they say here but they don't (9:59 - 10:05)
really explain very well in the game uh (10:02 - 10:07)
which is another way to obtain new items (10:05 - 10:08)
when you upgrade your battle pass you (10:07 - 10:08)
will (10:08 - 10:11)
receive additional rare items like a (10:08 - 10:12)
rare hollow ware (10:11 - 10:15)
that would be for cinderella so it's i (10:12 - 10:18)
think it goes up to 90 the battle pass (10:15 - 10:20)
uh unite will be available on mobile (10:18 - 10:22)
this is the question i got the most this (10:20 - 10:24)
week is when's it coming to mobile (10:22 - 10:27)
in september cross play between the (10:24 - 10:28)
nintendo switch and the (10:27 - 10:30)
smartphone this is i'm gonna read this (10:28 - 10:31)
sentence (10:30 - 10:33)
you take for what it's worth cross play (10:31 - 10:35)
between the nintendo switch and (10:33 - 10:36)
smartphone (10:35 - 10:38)
is planned (10:36 - 10:38)
which will allow players on both (10:39 - 10:43)
platforms to battle against each one (10:41 - 10:44)
another (10:43 - 10:45)
additionally if you log in using your (10:44 - 10:47)
nintendo account or your trainer club (10:45 - 10:49)
account you will be see (10:47 - 10:50)
you will be able to see your game data (10:49 - 10:54)
on any device that was another question (10:50 - 10:55)
uh so if you put a bunch of money into (10:54 - 10:57)
the switch version do you have to start (10:55 - 10:59)
over on the (10:57 - 11:02)
ipad version doesn't seem like it uh (10:59 - 11:03)
with this feature you can play on your (11:02 - 11:03)
hall (11:03 - 11:06)
you can play at home using your tv and (11:03 - 11:06)
the nintendo switch (11:06 - 11:08)
on the go using your mobile version or i (11:06 - 11:10)
don't know you just take your switch (11:08 - 11:11)
with you i guess (11:10 - 11:13)
but i guess you would need internet for (11:11 - 11:15)
that (11:13 - 11:18)
and the game is out so (11:15 - 11:21)
before we talk about the money or the (11:18 - 11:23)
battle pass or (11:21 - 11:25)
and that stuff let's talk about the game (11:23 - 11:26)
itself (11:25 - 11:28)
uh this is the first moba i've played (11:26 - 11:30)
although i've watched people play mobas (11:28 - 11:31)
that's not true i played like 10 minutes (11:30 - 11:33)
of heroes of the storm (11:31 - 11:36)
um i've watched people play moba so i (11:33 - 11:39)
always understood the gist of it (11:36 - 11:41)
uh and my biggest concern was would i (11:39 - 11:44)
like imoba (11:41 - 11:48)
i uh 40 hours in i still can't answer (11:44 - 11:50)
that question (11:48 - 11:50)
i think 40 hours in the answer (11:50 - 11:57)
is you like more aspects of mobas (11:53 - 12:00)
than you hate here's i think (11:57 - 12:04)
the answer is yes i love the game (12:00 - 12:08)
and yes i understand why people who play (12:04 - 12:12)
mobas hate their lives (12:08 - 12:12)
i think that is the answer like i now (12:12 - 12:15)
and (12:15 - 12:18)
i understand very quickly the toxicity (12:15 - 12:20)
that exists in mobas and why people are (12:18 - 12:22)
always frustrated (12:20 - 12:24)
i guess you can apply that to like team (12:22 - 12:26)
games in general (12:24 - 12:28)
and i think back in all the raids i did (12:26 - 12:30)
in destiny which was like a six person (12:28 - 12:31)
thing (12:30 - 12:33)
and then one person kept messing up (12:31 - 12:34)
their specific (12:33 - 12:40)
role that person potentially your spouse (12:34 - 12:40)
no yes sometimes but no other times (12:42 - 12:46)
i mean the difference is that when irene (12:45 - 12:48)
was doing bad (12:46 - 12:49)
we would put her in a position where it (12:48 - 12:52)
would minimize impact (12:49 - 12:54)
true true i mean the same thing happens (12:52 - 12:55)
in (12:54 - 12:57)
rating and final fantasy 14 like you (12:55 - 12:59)
need people to know what they're doing (12:57 - 13:00)
if that person is not (12:59 - 13:03)
able to do that i mean you're like (13:00 - 13:07)
get it together well the thing i've (13:03 - 13:08)
noticed too and i would always say it (13:07 - 13:11)
vocally on stream is like (13:08 - 13:14)
oh i bet i lost this mat i i bet i'm the (13:11 - 13:15)
reason this match lost and sometimes you (13:14 - 13:16)
have a bad game (13:15 - 13:19)
sometimes like you know when i'm in top (13:16 - 13:20)
lane (13:19 - 13:23)
and that player is just better than me (13:20 - 13:24)
it's like (13:23 - 13:27)
i'm i'm not i'm not sure what to do (13:24 - 13:30)
like do i move to a different lane like (13:27 - 13:31)
do i just suffer (13:30 - 13:34)
like i don't know that high-end part of (13:31 - 13:35)
being like this person is clearly (13:34 - 13:36)
outclassing me (13:35 - 13:37)
and i'm not good enough to compete with (13:36 - 13:39)
them and now i'm the reason the team (13:37 - 13:39)
lost (13:39 - 13:41)
but i'm at least self-aware that like oh (13:39 - 13:43)
it's my it's my uh (13:41 - 13:44)
it was me maybe it was me i was the (13:43 - 13:47)
reason we lost i mean (13:44 - 13:50)
i'm support so i am where i (13:47 - 13:52)
i support but like if somebody can (13:50 - 13:53)
clearly do better than (13:52 - 13:55)
then you literally switch to supporting (13:53 - 13:57)
them right like you attack the things (13:55 - 13:59)
that are in their way (13:57 - 14:02)
you you switch your mode to being like i (13:59 - 14:03)
am not the scorer here (14:02 - 14:05)
but i am going to help assist and when (14:03 - 14:06)
there's not something that they're (14:05 - 14:08)
actually doing (14:06 - 14:11)
i am going to kill the wild pokemon (14:08 - 14:12)
around me so that when (14:11 - 14:15)
we do do a big push and i assist them to (14:12 - 14:16)
clear the way (14:15 - 14:19)
i can make my tiny score but like a (14:16 - 14:19)
person's (14:19 - 14:22)
way better than you like switch to (14:19 - 14:24)
support but i mean i am a support player (14:22 - 14:25)
like that (14:24 - 14:27)
that is my happy place right now is (14:25 - 14:29)
playing elder goss and healing people (14:27 - 14:32)
and you guys are talking about playing (14:29 - 14:34)
without being able to talk to the other (14:32 - 14:36)
people on your team right (14:34 - 14:38)
yes there's a differentiation there (14:36 - 14:40)
because i've primarily only played (14:38 - 14:43)
with people i was talking to and (14:40 - 14:44)
coordinating with (14:43 - 14:47)
so i wanted so i i play a lot of (14:44 - 14:50)
ranked stuff me too um like i play i (14:47 - 14:52)
play ranked apex legends (14:50 - 14:53)
and the the reason i play ranked over (14:52 - 14:55)
duos or triples (14:53 - 14:58)
sorry is you get penalized if you (14:55 - 14:59)
dropped in rank (14:58 - 15:00)
so what happens normally in like the (14:59 - 15:02)
free play is (15:00 - 15:04)
people have like less of a commitment so (15:02 - 15:05)
like they'll die (15:04 - 15:07)
and instead of like them waiting for you (15:05 - 15:09)
to revive them they just leave the game (15:07 - 15:10)
and move on and it's that's really (15:09 - 15:13)
frustrating so in ranked there's like (15:10 - 15:14)
that commitment of (15:13 - 15:16)
well you can't leave because you'll get (15:14 - 15:17)
a 10 minute penalty and then you can't (15:16 - 15:20)
even play the game for 10 minutes (15:17 - 15:24)
and i personally like even though i know (15:20 - 15:27)
ranked is like more sweaty in most games (15:24 - 15:29)
i like having a visual (15:27 - 15:33)
of how i'm doing like (15:29 - 15:35)
i'm going from silver to bronze to (15:33 - 15:37)
silver to silver to gold (15:35 - 15:38)
and then that's where i usually end up (15:37 - 15:41)
at apex at the end of the season is (15:38 - 15:42)
i don't have a lot of time to play maybe (15:41 - 15:44)
i could push to whatever comes after (15:42 - 15:45)
platinum (15:44 - 15:48)
um but i like knowing where i am (15:45 - 15:50)
and i don't get that feedback in like (15:48 - 15:53)
pickup play or just casuals (15:50 - 15:56)
um and i don't know it kind of feels (15:53 - 15:57)
weird (15:56 - 16:00)
like i guess you can still win but at (15:57 - 16:02)
least in like something like (16:00 - 16:05)
final fantasy 14 or destiny like there's (16:02 - 16:07)
an end point right like you beat the (16:05 - 16:08)
raid (16:07 - 16:11)
yeah you're good to go um or do it again (16:08 - 16:12)
next week (16:11 - 16:13)
because you need yeah or something like (16:12 - 16:15)
destiny with iron banner which wasn't (16:13 - 16:18)
really ranked but it was more like (16:15 - 16:21)
we're doing this to get certain rewards (16:18 - 16:24)
yeah (16:21 - 16:29)
um so when i did ranked and unite (16:24 - 16:30)
i wanted to do it solo because i (16:29 - 16:33)
normally solo apex as well (16:30 - 16:35)
because i i want to know like my skill (16:33 - 16:37)
set and i didn't want to like be carried (16:35 - 16:38)
by (16:37 - 16:40)
because for every time somebody says (16:38 - 16:42)
like oh my team was bad that's why i (16:40 - 16:43)
lost (16:42 - 16:45)
you could ease no and no one ever does (16:43 - 16:46)
this but you could easily make the (16:45 - 16:47)
argument of like (16:46 - 16:50)
oh everyone else was good and i was bad (16:47 - 16:52)
but we won because of them right like (16:50 - 16:53)
even though you get worse people you (16:52 - 16:55)
will get better people yeah (16:53 - 16:59)
uh and i was able to make it to expert (16:55 - 17:02)
which greg also made it to expert um (16:59 - 17:03)
solo queue (17:02 - 17:05)
and i was like really proud of that (17:03 - 17:06)
because it wasn't like (17:05 - 17:09)
oh i'm clearly the worst out of my four (17:06 - 17:11)
friends and like the reason i got to (17:09 - 17:13)
expert was because of them i wanted to (17:11 - 17:14)
be like well the reason i got to expert (17:13 - 17:15)
was (17:14 - 17:18)
because i because me (17:15 - 17:21)
we had good games last night though yeah (17:18 - 17:22)
that was the first time (17:21 - 17:24)
uh i played with a real human on ranked (17:22 - 17:27)
with greg (17:24 - 17:27)
and and twitch got to see my great (17:27 - 17:32)
support skills (17:30 - 17:35)
my clutch plays what was funny is (17:32 - 17:38)
because there's a delay (17:35 - 17:40)
i would do things and have moved past (17:38 - 17:43)
and then i wouldn't hear you (17:40 - 17:45)
talk about that i'm like oh that was (17:43 - 17:47)
five minutes ago (17:45 - 17:49)
focus what are you doing steve focus (17:47 - 17:50)
that was five minutes (17:49 - 17:52)
wait that's because you're delayed (17:50 - 17:54)
[Laughter] (17:52 - 17:56)
uh well what is your overall thoughts on (17:54 - 17:59)
the game i mean i've been playing a lot (17:56 - 18:00)
of it i i tried to look up and see how (17:59 - 18:03)
much time i've put into it but i can't (18:00 - 18:05)
i just it's not enough yet that this (18:03 - 18:07)
week it's like something after like (18:05 - 18:10)
a week it'll show you something yeah uh (18:07 - 18:12)
i mean i enjoy it i (18:10 - 18:15)
originally wanted to main one character (18:12 - 18:19)
and that was not working out for me so (18:15 - 18:22)
i switched to a support character (18:19 - 18:25)
but i pretty much have only played with (18:22 - 18:28)
like my friends who are with either (18:25 - 18:32)
on a discord call or in person so (18:28 - 18:36)
we coordinate that way and uh (18:32 - 18:38)
most of my friends are very experienced (18:36 - 18:39)
in mobas and (18:38 - 18:42)
have a lot so they're kind of like just (18:39 - 18:44)
telling me how to how to go through it (18:42 - 18:46)
and and what to do i mean we're not (18:44 - 18:48)
perfect but (18:46 - 18:50)
uh i've been having a lot of fun i think (18:48 - 18:52)
it's just it's it's fun to sit down (18:50 - 18:53)
because it's ten minutes right yeah (18:52 - 18:55)
like if we have a half an hour to kill (18:53 - 18:57)
we can do three (18:55 - 19:02)
rounds three matches and and walk away (18:57 - 19:02)
i don't like talonflame no i like (19:03 - 19:07)
talonflame (19:06 - 19:10)
i talonflame is not i'm not at a level (19:07 - 19:14)
where i can play talon and flame well (19:10 - 19:16)
as opposed to what i now play which is (19:14 - 19:17)
snorlax (19:16 - 19:20)
which i have been able to get mvp (19:17 - 19:22)
playing snorlax (19:20 - 19:24)
oh we have to we all know that getting (19:22 - 19:25)
mvp (19:24 - 19:28)
is all that matters we need to play (19:25 - 19:28)
together (19:28 - 19:31)
because we so we did a friendly match (19:28 - 19:31)
against (19:31 - 19:35)
steve uh where one of his uh (19:31 - 19:38)
members in chat and i just was snorlax (19:35 - 19:41)
and el degas at the lower lane (19:38 - 19:44)
and nobody could get past us we just (19:41 - 19:46)
we just kept everybody at me and (19:44 - 19:48)
everyone as well seems like i haven't (19:46 - 19:48)
seen (19:48 - 19:51)
craig this entire game i'm like yeah (19:48 - 19:52)
because you're not coming down (19:51 - 19:55)
to death alley where we are murdering or (19:52 - 19:56)
murdering everybody (19:55 - 19:58)
uh because you fools are gonna come and (19:56 - 19:59)
try to take us down (19:58 - 20:02)
and you can't now i think our best combo (19:59 - 20:06)
was uh snorlax and alolan ninetales that (20:02 - 20:08)
is that is an outstanding when i i do (20:06 - 20:09)
play alolan nine tails (20:08 - 20:12)
uh as a more support role and (20:09 - 20:16)
like the reach and slow down of alolan (20:12 - 20:17)
nine tails compared to (20:16 - 20:19)
the i'm not gonna jump in and wreck (20:17 - 20:21)
house that starlax does (20:19 - 20:25)
is an amazing combo (20:21 - 20:25)
um and greg your overall thoughts before (20:27 - 20:30)
you move on to character roster and (20:29 - 20:32)
stuff (20:30 - 20:34)
people think have asked me the question (20:32 - 20:36)
like oh do you like the game and my (20:34 - 20:39)
response is (20:36 - 20:42)
i paid money i gave them money no you (20:39 - 20:43)
did (20:42 - 20:44)
well we have to get to the moment okay (20:43 - 20:46)
wait wait wait wait so i have a quick (20:44 - 20:48)
this this was a discussion i had with (20:46 - 20:49)
one of my friends and i'm (20:48 - 20:52)
pretty certain i can predict the outcome (20:49 - 20:54)
of what how you guys would react (20:52 - 20:57)
so my friend was playing and looked at (20:54 - 20:59)
the roster of pokemon and was like oh (20:57 - 21:01)
geez all of these pokemon are so (20:59 - 21:02)
expensive (21:01 - 21:06)
to earn from points in the game okay and (21:02 - 21:06)
i (21:06 - 21:08)
said well you're gonna be playing this (21:06 - 21:11)
game a lot anyways you love mobas (21:08 - 21:14)
now my prediction is greg (21:11 - 21:17)
will understand what i was saying what i (21:14 - 21:17)
meant and (21:17 - 21:21)
steve will take it as my friend took it (21:17 - 21:21)
so (21:21 - 21:23)
let's go with steve first steve how do (21:21 - 21:25)
you react to well you're going to be (21:23 - 21:26)
playing it a lot (21:25 - 21:27)
you love mobas you're going to be (21:26 - 21:30)
putting a lot of time into this game i (21:27 - 21:31)
would take it as like (21:30 - 21:33)
yeah unlock one character a week it's (21:31 - 21:35)
fine and greg (21:33 - 21:37)
yeah like you're gonna get the okay so (21:35 - 21:40)
you both agree with each other that was (21:37 - 21:43)
i meant you will earn points yeah you (21:40 - 21:44)
will get those (21:43 - 21:46)
he took it as if you're going to love (21:44 - 21:48)
this game so much throw money at it (21:46 - 21:49)
right now because you want to unlock all (21:48 - 21:51)
the books (21:49 - 21:53)
and i was like no no i looked up that (21:51 - 21:55)
looked up at the tv and he's putting his (21:53 - 21:56)
credit card in and i was like i didn't (21:55 - 21:58)
mean spend money (21:56 - 21:59)
i meant you're going to earn the (21:58 - 22:01)
characters yeah you're going to earn the (21:59 - 22:02)
characters over time (22:01 - 22:05)
plus there's like so i will say this the (22:02 - 22:07)
very first day i was playing i'm like oh (22:05 - 22:09)
i'm going to buy a little nine tails and (22:07 - 22:09)
then it looks (22:09 - 22:11)
right it's like no i get a little (22:09 - 22:12)
details for free (22:11 - 22:17)
tomorrow yeah i am not gonna buy this (22:12 - 22:17)
uh overall i do really i really do enjoy (22:17 - 22:22)
the game (22:21 - 22:25)
um i get frustrated that people (22:22 - 22:27)
don't yet understand what they're (22:25 - 22:29)
supposed to do in the game like (22:27 - 22:32)
if i am playing el degas and you all (22:29 - 22:34)
leave me alone (22:32 - 22:38)
i'm not doing my like you've all left (22:34 - 22:40)
there's nobody for me to support i can't (22:38 - 22:41)
i can keep things (22:40 - 22:44)
at bay for a while but they're gonna see (22:41 - 22:46)
that i'm alone and they're gonna swap me (22:44 - 22:48)
and there's nothing i can do about it (22:46 - 22:49)
because i am (22:48 - 22:53)
alone and a support character and (22:49 - 22:54)
so let me explain is that right it came (22:53 - 22:57)
up that i left the pokemon unite channel (22:54 - 22:58)
in slack (22:57 - 23:00)
and there's a very particular reason why (22:58 - 23:02)
i did that that's an overall (23:00 - 23:05)
also response to kind of like the first (23:02 - 23:06)
week of the game (23:05 - 23:09)
um i've been playing with players who (23:06 - 23:10)
play a lot of mobas (23:09 - 23:13)
who understand what the different lanes (23:10 - 23:13)
mean (23:13 - 23:15)
who should be in what lane they've (23:13 - 23:16)
already started doing configurations of (23:15 - 23:18)
this is the best build out for this (23:16 - 23:20)
pokemon for this lane (23:18 - 23:23)
etc etc i (23:20 - 23:26)
also am the kind of person who if i see (23:23 - 23:27)
an unread (23:26 - 23:29)
channel in slack cannot ignore it and (23:27 - 23:31)
and compelled to go in (23:29 - 23:33)
and look and there's just so many folks (23:31 - 23:34)
in there (23:33 - 23:36)
who don't have moba experience and also (23:34 - 23:38)
like overall (23:36 - 23:40)
like people playing unite right now who (23:38 - 23:42)
don't have moba experience (23:40 - 23:45)
that i just got tired of seeing the (23:42 - 23:46)
i don't know what this means i don't (23:45 - 23:48)
know what that means this and like the (23:46 - 23:51)
old repeated explanations and i (23:48 - 23:53)
was like i'll come back at some point (23:51 - 23:56)
when it's just the people who (23:53 - 23:56)
want to talk more key strategy and (23:57 - 24:01)
detail i i don't think that's a bad (23:59 - 24:02)
thing though people (24:01 - 24:04)
like the game did what it was supposed (24:02 - 24:06)
to do which is get people into (24:04 - 24:08)
the series they have played yes uh i (24:06 - 24:09)
mean i (24:08 - 24:12)
i am surprised at (24:09 - 24:16)
like i have been up till 1am (24:12 - 24:18)
since it's come out playing matches (24:16 - 24:19)
because it's always like well just one (24:18 - 24:21)
match and i gotta push their ranks i met (24:19 - 24:23)
great four and then (24:21 - 24:24)
i would get a team where i'm like okay (24:23 - 24:26)
you've knocked me down (24:24 - 24:28)
now i have to now i have to go in (24:26 - 24:29)
because you all left me (24:28 - 24:33)
uh and ultimately like like playing with (24:29 - 24:34)
drew realized like drew (24:33 - 24:37)
drew truly is a nine tails main the (24:34 - 24:40)
things that drew can do with nine tails (24:37 - 24:45)
because drew has a much more aggressive (24:40 - 24:46)
play style and i'm like i (24:45 - 24:50)
like support i like seeing the situation (24:46 - 24:52)
and responding to it (24:50 - 24:55)
not i have to push to get goals (24:52 - 24:58)
so like i'm decided to focus on elder (24:55 - 25:00)
goss because i really (24:58 - 25:02)
a i don't find it stressful like most (25:00 - 25:04)
pvp games i'm (25:02 - 25:06)
always stressed out and that stops me (25:04 - 25:07)
from playing (25:06 - 25:11)
in here one we'll talk about this later (25:07 - 25:12)
but like there's not (25:11 - 25:15)
there's not a voice chat unless i choose (25:12 - 25:16)
to and i'm gonna choose to do it with my (25:15 - 25:17)
friends (25:16 - 25:19)
so that's already gonna be a different (25:17 - 25:21)
experience two (25:19 - 25:22)
i feel like it's just ten minutes worth (25:21 - 25:25)
of time people are still figuring out (25:22 - 25:26)
the game (25:25 - 25:28)
uh my frustration levels are probably (25:26 - 25:29)
with them figuring (25:28 - 25:32)
out how to play the game and not (25:29 - 25:33)
necessarily that (25:32 - 25:36)
they were bad or that i was super bad (25:33 - 25:38)
like it's been (25:36 - 25:41)
five days at most now and (25:38 - 25:44)
i everybody's figuring it out (25:41 - 25:46)
and it it plays in a very different way (25:44 - 25:48)
there are things i don't like about the (25:46 - 25:49)
game like (25:48 - 25:50)
there comes a certain point where you (25:49 - 25:52)
just can't catch up no matter what (25:50 - 25:56)
like also if (25:52 - 25:58)
it's internet and if one person just (25:56 - 25:59)
does (25:58 - 26:01)
like accepts and picks the character but (25:59 - 26:03)
then can't connect and they just sit (26:01 - 26:04)
back in base (26:03 - 26:06)
a four versus five is almost impossible (26:04 - 26:08)
to come back from (26:06 - 26:11)
yeah and there are there are things like (26:08 - 26:13)
the game doesn't register that one (26:11 - 26:14)
person is gone and (26:13 - 26:17)
doesn't like have a way to correct for (26:14 - 26:18)
that yet (26:17 - 26:20)
so that it is just kind of done you can (26:18 - 26:22)
report them (26:20 - 26:25)
yes if a person is gone i don't know how (26:22 - 26:28)
long it is it will replace it with a bot (26:25 - 26:30)
and then you yeah you can tell the bot (26:28 - 26:32)
to be like top lane (26:30 - 26:34)
or bottom line yeah i mean we finally in (26:32 - 26:38)
one game got the bot (26:34 - 26:41)
a minute before the match was over and (26:38 - 26:42)
it's like okay well (26:41 - 26:45)
we have been wrecked this entire time (26:42 - 26:45)
yeah (26:45 - 26:47)
i mean there's there there needs to be a (26:45 - 26:49)
thing like in i think call of duty (26:47 - 26:50)
and apex both do this but if you're in (26:49 - 26:52)
ranked and (26:50 - 26:56)
you drop you should be penalized 10 (26:52 - 26:57)
15 minutes of not being able to play i (26:56 - 26:59)
mean and i do know that they have a good (26:57 - 27:00)
sportsmanship (26:59 - 27:03)
meter in the game i don't fully know (27:00 - 27:05)
what affects that (27:03 - 27:08)
but i (27:05 - 27:08)
didn't expect to like this game as much (27:10 - 27:14)
as i did and especially on the first day (27:12 - 27:16)
well i'm like yep i'm giving this money (27:14 - 27:19)
like i'm already i've already gotten 20 (27:16 - 27:22)
worth of fun out of this game so yeah (27:19 - 27:22)
i'll (27:22 - 27:26)
i'll pay and have gems i'm not buying (27:22 - 27:28)
characters i'm not buying clothes (27:26 - 27:30)
i just bought the extra battle pass (27:28 - 27:31)
there's not um (27:30 - 27:33)
just a heads up there's like not a big (27:31 - 27:35)
downside to buying characters if you (27:33 - 27:37)
bought nine tails (27:35 - 27:38)
and then nine tails like was the free (27:37 - 27:40)
thing it actually gives you like a bunch (27:38 - 27:41)
of coins (27:40 - 27:42)
because it acknowledges that you bought (27:41 - 27:44)
it so it's not like (27:42 - 27:46)
i get it like some people like there's a (27:44 - 27:48)
lot of people that are playing syndras (27:46 - 27:51)
but cinderace is the 14 yeah sorry no (27:48 - 27:53)
sid race is the seven day free (27:51 - 27:55)
pokemon and then greninja is the 14 day (27:53 - 27:56)
free pokemon (27:55 - 27:58)
so like i get it i mean if cinderella is (27:56 - 27:59)
your favorite pokemon and you don't you (27:58 - 28:00)
don't want to wait a full week (27:59 - 28:02)
i and i said this with cram like i was (28:00 - 28:04)
like i'm sure cram is pay (28:02 - 28:06)
paid i'm sure i could you know earn (28:04 - 28:08)
enough currency to unlock him (28:06 - 28:10)
but i i want to play my favorite (28:08 - 28:12)
character my favorite pokemon (28:10 - 28:15)
right away because wait look favorite (28:12 - 28:17)
pokemon don't win games (28:15 - 28:20)
dude yeah (28:17 - 28:21)
you're off the team you're off the team (28:20 - 28:23)
because that's how will not against the (28:21 - 28:25)
world now (28:23 - 28:25)
i mean i guess the the other way is like (28:26 - 28:30)
oh just play it and don't worry about (28:28 - 28:32)
unlocking the character maybe you won't (28:30 - 28:33)
like it but it's like what if i do like (28:32 - 28:34)
it (28:33 - 28:38)
yeah and you missed all that time fomo (28:34 - 28:41)
crammer city for things like crema (28:38 - 28:44)
where the gameplay is really difficult (28:41 - 28:45)
like (28:44 - 28:48)
what kramer ant does is very situational (28:45 - 28:50)
and you really have to (28:48 - 28:52)
understand how to use those like they (28:50 - 28:53)
aren't kidding when it's like (28:52 - 28:55)
expert characters like you have to (28:53 - 28:57)
understand what these things do (28:55 - 29:00)
and why you would use them the other (28:57 - 29:02)
thing i don't like about (29:00 - 29:05)
unite is once you pick your moves if you (29:02 - 29:06)
find out that other people (29:05 - 29:09)
aren't like going that route there's not (29:06 - 29:11)
a way to say like okay we'll switch me (29:09 - 29:12)
over from pollen puff to (29:11 - 29:15)
leaf tornado like i can't undo the (29:12 - 29:16)
choice that i made or at least (29:15 - 29:20)
i don't know how to yeah um because like (29:16 - 29:21)
i'm realizing they (29:20 - 29:23)
aren't playing in a style that supports (29:21 - 29:25)
a pollen puff play style i need leaf (29:23 - 29:26)
tornado to be able (29:25 - 29:28)
to stand on my own but i already made (29:26 - 29:30)
that choice (29:28 - 29:33)
and i can't i don't know how if you can (29:30 - 29:34)
i don't think you can (29:33 - 29:36)
switch it to the other thing so i'm (29:34 - 29:38)
stuck with a sub-optimal choice (29:36 - 29:42)
based off of the situation i'm in i (29:38 - 29:44)
don't have a way to change it (29:42 - 29:49)
yeah the thing that i feel like (29:44 - 29:49)
helps as the character you're playing so (29:50 - 29:55)
like i think i have a pretty good (29:53 - 29:56)
understanding of (29:55 - 29:58)
cram because i've been playing them (29:56 - 29:59)
non-stop (29:58 - 30:01)
and not a lot of people are playing them (29:59 - 30:03)
because they probably (30:01 - 30:06)
use their coins unlike something else or (30:03 - 30:07)
don't have enough coins (30:06 - 30:10)
it's a hard character to play uh but the (30:07 - 30:12)
other thing that i feel like (30:10 - 30:14)
maybe people don't think about and (30:12 - 30:15)
here's maybe a little bit of advice (30:14 - 30:17)
is like understand what your character (30:15 - 30:19)
does against other characters (30:17 - 30:22)
like when the first time i saw mr mime (30:19 - 30:25)
which was like maybe like (30:22 - 30:27)
it was like literally maybe eight hours (30:25 - 30:29)
in until i saw my first mr mime (30:27 - 30:30)
i was like i have no clue what this dude (30:29 - 30:32)
does am i supposed to like rush him am i (30:30 - 30:33)
supposed to like (30:32 - 30:35)
keep my distance like how much health (30:33 - 30:37)
does he have um (30:35 - 30:40)
the same with uh like cinderace like the (30:37 - 30:41)
first time i saw the first couple times (30:40 - 30:43)
i saw cinderella i was just roasting (30:41 - 30:44)
cinderella's like just plumbing through (30:43 - 30:46)
him and then i found (30:44 - 30:49)
like the next day like oh this cinderace (30:46 - 30:50)
person is destroying me (30:49 - 30:53)
yeah so it's like was the first day of (30:50 - 30:54)
cinder race just so (30:53 - 30:57)
bad and then the like second day people (30:54 - 30:58)
figured it out (30:57 - 31:00)
so i feel like playing the character (30:58 - 31:02)
even though you're like i know like when (31:00 - 31:03)
i played when i first started playing (31:02 - 31:04)
cinderella's (31:03 - 31:06)
i was like well i should play it so i (31:04 - 31:07)
understand what they do and i was like (31:06 - 31:09)
okay i get it now (31:07 - 31:11)
but also i don't like playing sid race (31:09 - 31:14)
but it's still a really good (31:11 - 31:16)
understanding when you're going against (31:14 - 31:18)
the cinder ace or any other pokemon to (31:16 - 31:18)
be like (31:18 - 31:19)
okay this is what it does i still don't (31:18 - 31:21)
know what wigglytuff does i've seen like (31:19 - 31:22)
four wiggly tuffs and i know it double (31:21 - 31:24)
slaps and i know it puts you to sleep i (31:22 - 31:25)
don't know what its other moves are but (31:24 - 31:26)
every time it shows up it's real (31:25 - 31:30)
annoying cannot (31:26 - 31:32)
wrap my head around how gengar works (31:30 - 31:34)
when i'm facing what i'm like (31:32 - 31:37)
where did you come from how are you here (31:34 - 31:38)
what am i supposed to do (31:37 - 31:41)
everybody left me please is eating me (31:38 - 31:42)
alive (31:41 - 31:45)
yeah or you see jager come out of (31:42 - 31:47)
nowhere and you're like how are you (31:45 - 31:49)
already level 10 everyone else is level (31:47 - 31:50)
five (31:49 - 31:52)
where did where did you come from can i (31:50 - 31:54)
can i do a psa (31:52 - 31:56)
on this particular thing yes this issue (31:54 - 31:57)
okay (31:56 - 32:00)
so as far as i understand please tell me (31:57 - 32:01)
if i'm completely wrong (32:00 - 32:04)
you level up as you collect (32:01 - 32:08)
eos energy in the field (32:04 - 32:10)
is it time based no it's by knocking out (32:08 - 32:11)
the minions (32:10 - 32:14)
yeah okay okay same thing in my opinion (32:11 - 32:15)
you knock out minions to collect eos (32:14 - 32:16)
energy so (32:15 - 32:17)
oh yeah you just don't have to pick up (32:16 - 32:19)
the energy right okay (32:17 - 32:22)
we we all start at the base together we (32:19 - 32:24)
run out into the field (32:22 - 32:27)
right if you see me (32:24 - 32:31)
go after apom number one you keep going (32:27 - 32:35)
do not steal my apom by because only the (32:31 - 32:37)
person who gets the last hit (32:35 - 32:40)
gets credit for taking out when it comes (32:37 - 32:41)
to leveling up (32:40 - 32:44)
no no you get you you get the energy the (32:41 - 32:46)
last hit gets the energy (32:44 - 32:48)
whoever's attacking it still gets (32:46 - 32:50)
experience yeah do you get enough (32:48 - 32:51)
experience (32:50 - 32:54)
so that i'm not sure of this so you so (32:51 - 32:55)
the person (32:54 - 32:58)
the main person gets i think a little (32:55 - 33:00)
bit more experience and the assist gets (32:58 - 33:02)
less but just like get get your own (33:00 - 33:04)
creeps folks but you don't need to take (33:02 - 33:08)
here's here's the thing i'm using the xp (33:04 - 33:12)
share item so i don't get (33:08 - 33:16)
experience for assisting i (33:12 - 33:18)
have to help you kill things so you (33:16 - 33:21)
level up faster so my xp share item (33:18 - 33:24)
goes off and starts auto leveling me (33:21 - 33:27)
so i'm always falling behind (33:24 - 33:29)
and hitting a couple of things while i'm (33:27 - 33:31)
letting the person i'm following (33:29 - 33:33)
kill things so it frustrates me like (33:31 - 33:34)
steve would run past the thing that (33:33 - 33:36)
we're killing i'm like no you have to (33:34 - 33:38)
kill this i didn't realize you were (33:36 - 33:40)
running xp until i saw (33:38 - 33:42)
like i was literally 40 hours in the (33:40 - 33:44)
game and i never saw a light bulb (33:42 - 33:46)
above somebody's head yeah and then you (33:44 - 33:47)
had the light bulb and i was like am i (33:46 - 33:48)
missing something (33:47 - 33:50)
i've seen out the gas before i've never (33:48 - 33:51)
seen this light bulb yeah so (33:50 - 33:54)
the other thing too though is there are (33:51 - 33:56)
faster characters and slower characters (33:54 - 33:59)
if you are playing a faster character (33:56 - 34:01)
run past the first two apom (33:59 - 34:04)
and get the two go towards the two that (34:01 - 34:04)
are standing (34:04 - 34:07)
like there's two like yeah oh i always (34:04 - 34:09)
do those two because i have a aoe and i (34:07 - 34:10)
hit both of them at the same time well (34:09 - 34:11)
there (34:10 - 34:12)
that's that's fine but you don't like (34:11 - 34:14)
everybody doesn't have to stop (34:12 - 34:16)
at the first a palm right and not with (34:14 - 34:17)
that attitude yeah (34:16 - 34:20)
the team game we're all gonna team up go (34:17 - 34:22)
on your own get into the middle there's (34:20 - 34:23)
all sorts of things in there that you (34:22 - 34:24)
can kill fast and (34:23 - 34:26)
level up 30 hours in i didn't realize (34:24 - 34:28)
there's like a single lilly pup that (34:26 - 34:28)
spawns (34:28 - 34:31)
yeah but it's only worth it i know but i (34:28 - 34:32)
would always run past (34:31 - 34:34)
like i would always run straight up to (34:32 - 34:36)
get those a palms and then somebody was (34:34 - 34:37)
like oh lily pup and i was like there's (34:36 - 34:38)
a little lily pop (34:37 - 34:40)
then you need to go around the wall to (34:38 - 34:41)
get you yeah yeah yeah around the wall (34:40 - 34:43)
does it turn into stoutland i have only (34:41 - 34:45)
seen it turned into hertier (34:43 - 34:49)
i've never seen it evolve i've seen (34:45 - 34:49)
but i've never seen the stoutland i (34:49 - 34:53)
don't know what required what (34:51 - 34:55)
makes that what level has to happen to (34:53 - 34:56)
make them evolve like i don't understand (34:55 - 34:57)
how they level up (34:56 - 35:00)
throughout the game i just time i think (34:57 - 35:01)
it's just time yeah but (35:00 - 35:04)
um let me revise my statement then if (35:01 - 35:06)
you are playing a support character (35:04 - 35:09)
let your dps or your main (35:06 - 35:12)
chara dude who's doing all the work hard (35:09 - 35:14)
fast kill whatever (35:12 - 35:16)
get get the eos energy yeah because you (35:14 - 35:18)
don't need snorlax taking a nap on the (35:16 - 35:20)
other team's goal to pop (35:18 - 35:25)
out some energy it's always really cute (35:20 - 35:25)
uh all right let's take a break when we (35:26 - 35:30)
come back we're going to talk about the (35:28 - 35:32)
battle pass and the money (35:30 - 35:36)
um and the characters because (35:32 - 35:37)
i'm sure there are very few people that (35:36 - 35:39)
have every character unlocked at this (35:37 - 35:41)
point unless you spent a lot of money (35:39 - 35:44)
i didn't so uh we will be (35:41 - 36:00)
right back (35:44 - 36:00)
[Music] (36:00 - 36:11)
[Music] (36:13 - 36:28)
yes (36:25 - 36:28)
[Music] (36:28 - 36:35)
dynamics (36:39 - 36:42)
a dynamax band (36:47 - 36:58)
and we are back from our break (36:54 - 37:02)
all right there's a whole roster of (36:58 - 37:03)
characters i'm just going to run them (37:02 - 37:05)
down real quick just so we don't forget (37:03 - 37:06)
anyone in this conversation we got (37:05 - 37:07)
pikachu (37:06 - 37:10)
slobro charizard absol snorlax machamp (37:07 - 37:13)
crustal wigglytuff greninja alolan (37:10 - 37:15)
ninetales elder goss (37:13 - 37:18)
kramer ant talonflame gengar lucario (37:15 - 37:19)
garchomp (37:18 - 37:23)
venusaur cinderace mr mime and zeraora (37:19 - 37:26)
so there are 20 characters all together (37:23 - 37:27)
we know two more characters are coming (37:26 - 37:29)
blastoise and gardevoir (37:27 - 37:32)
and then a mystery character (37:29 - 37:32)
the game (37:32 - 37:35)
it's not surprising but the game doesn't (37:36 - 37:41)
give you a lot of characters off the bat (37:39 - 37:44)
which yeah was not last maybe it was (37:41 - 37:46)
last week but the week before (37:44 - 37:47)
where i was like i'm pretty sure cram's (37:46 - 37:52)
gonna be paid and i'm pretty sure (37:47 - 37:53)
i'm pretty sure a lot of characters are (37:52 - 37:55)
going to be paid but i didn't think they (37:53 - 37:56)
were only going to give you (37:55 - 37:59)
like four out of 20. i mean they're (37:56 - 38:00)
getting like (37:59 - 38:02)
what is it you get you got a one nine (38:00 - 38:03)
tails after three days (38:02 - 38:05)
you're getting crustal after six days (38:03 - 38:07)
you get a little nine tails (38:05 - 38:09)
the second day oh second day it's (38:07 - 38:11)
literally like the next day (38:09 - 38:12)
like if you're gonna stick with this (38:11 - 38:14)
game and you want to see this character (38:12 - 38:14)
like (38:14 - 38:16)
play it for a day and then the alolan (38:14 - 38:19)
night tails blocks (38:16 - 38:21)
um and they do that they do a kind of (38:19 - 38:22)
okay thing where they like give you two (38:21 - 38:24)
characters to pick from (38:22 - 38:25)
it's like i think it's like snorlax or (38:24 - 38:27)
el degas or it's like pikachu (38:25 - 38:29)
and slow bro i think or something like (38:27 - 38:30)
that (38:29 - 38:33)
i i didn't they give you like all five (38:30 - 38:34)
to choose from (38:33 - 38:36)
four no no they only give you four (38:34 - 38:37)
because you can't go into ranked until (38:36 - 38:39)
you have five so you either have to (38:37 - 38:41)
wait to unlock a fifth one which would (38:39 - 38:43)
be the next day (38:41 - 38:44)
with nine tails i thought they gave you (38:43 - 38:47)
five to choose (38:44 - 38:47)
it could be four because i think it was (38:56 - 38:59)
i think it was for me it was pikachu el (38:58 - 39:02)
degas (38:59 - 39:02)
snorlax isn't the same with elder goss (39:02 - 39:06)
and (39:05 - 39:09)
slow bro yeah cause i definitely picked (39:06 - 39:10)
slo-bro (39:09 - 39:14)
oh weird because i saw talonflame i (39:10 - 39:15)
i didn't even notice any of the other (39:14 - 39:17)
ones because i was like obviously i'm (39:15 - 39:20)
picking talent lane (39:17 - 39:20)
uh and then i did the math (39:22 - 39:29)
um so i i based the math off the 40 (39:26 - 39:33)
gem purchase so that's this (39:29 - 39:35)
let's talk about some of the problems of (39:33 - 39:37)
the game okay the first problem (39:35 - 39:41)
is their currency is (39:37 - 39:41)
so obscure to make you not realize how (39:41 - 39:46)
much money you spend (39:44 - 39:50)
and i just want to shout out pokemon go (39:46 - 39:53)
one coin is one penny it is (39:50 - 39:57)
very easy to know like a rocket radar is (39:53 - 39:58)
two bucks (39:57 - 40:01)
a a poffin is a dollar (39:58 - 40:05)
a raid pass a dollar it is nice it is (40:01 - 40:07)
it is it is very simple it's not (40:05 - 40:09)
predatory in any way (40:07 - 40:12)
so in unite it is (40:09 - 40:14)
forty dollars actually let's go up to (40:12 - 40:15)
the fifty dollars (40:14 - 40:18)
because fifty is half of a hundred easy (40:15 - 40:19)
right (40:18 - 40:23)
fifty dollars is three thousand (40:19 - 40:26)
five 500 gems so it's (40:23 - 40:30)
less gems than money which (40:26 - 40:33)
look i'm partnered with dna (40:30 - 40:35)
dna has been very nice to me their gem (40:33 - 40:36)
system also (40:35 - 40:39)
slightly obscure in that sense uh (40:36 - 40:42)
because it's like 99 cents for (40:39 - 40:44)
it's whatever their gem system is no (40:42 - 40:46)
better than this (40:44 - 40:48)
but it makes it it makes it confusing on (40:46 - 40:49)
purpose so you don't know how much money (40:48 - 40:50)
you're spending (40:49 - 40:53)
so there's um so characters end up being (40:50 - 40:55)
at least based on my math about seven (40:53 - 40:57)
dollars and fifty cents (40:55 - 41:00)
uh which is pretty equivalent to apex (40:57 - 41:01)
legends (41:00 - 41:03)
so apex legends has it where you can buy (41:01 - 41:05)
loot boxes they're a dollar (41:03 - 41:07)
they're 99 cents or 100 coins or (41:05 - 41:08)
whatever and then they have their (41:07 - 41:10)
characters so you can either buy it with (41:08 - 41:11)
the in-game current the (41:10 - 41:12)
the you can either buy it with this red (41:11 - 41:14)
currency that you earn just by playing (41:12 - 41:15)
matches or you can just (41:14 - 41:17)
pay real money which is around the seven (41:15 - 41:21)
dollar mark but then apex legends has um (41:17 - 41:23)
skins for guns and then skins for (41:21 - 41:25)
characters and like the premium (41:23 - 41:28)
the good stuff would be like twenty (41:25 - 41:29)
dollars of skin (41:28 - 41:31)
which i have always i've said on the (41:29 - 41:32)
show many times i think that's way too (41:31 - 41:33)
much for our skin (41:32 - 41:37)
i was told by my twitch chat that in (41:33 - 41:39)
fortnite skins are about (41:37 - 41:42)
ten dollars (41:39 - 41:42)
but a yen apex (41:43 - 41:46)
this kids these days have way too much (41:47 - 41:51)
money (41:50 - 41:54)
so the so the the the problem or not the (41:51 - 41:55)
problem but the (41:54 - 41:59)
the cramer ant skin (41:55 - 42:02)
for your character the the raincoat the (41:59 - 42:06)
raincoat is almost 20 (42:02 - 42:09)
because it's like 1300 (42:06 - 42:15)
gems and if you just look at the (42:09 - 42:18)
bonus gem okay so i there's the first (42:15 - 42:21)
time gem bonus (42:18 - 42:22)
that i can't really see anymore so i (42:21 - 42:24)
i've spent 20 in the game i did the (42:22 - 42:25)
first time (42:24 - 42:29)
gem bonus 20 which was 1200 plus 1200. (42:25 - 42:31)
um and once you do that once it's then (42:29 - 42:34)
1200 plus 130. (42:31 - 42:36)
um and then they they they have first (42:34 - 42:38)
time gem bonus so it's (42:36 - 42:41)
60 plus 60 99 cents 245 245 (42:38 - 42:45)
4. 490 490 eight dollars and then the (42:41 - 42:49)
the 12 20 12 20 20 so i did the 12 (42:45 - 42:51)
20 plus 12 20. that was how much i gave (42:49 - 42:52)
the game (42:51 - 42:55)
you can just because that was another (42:52 - 42:58)
question you can do all four (42:55 - 43:00)
um first time gem bonuses it's not it's (42:58 - 43:02)
not like if you pick one it locks you (43:00 - 43:04)
out of the other you can do all four (43:02 - 43:07)
but the kramer ant skin was oh yeah the (43:04 - 43:08)
cr (43:07 - 43:10)
here's another okay so they purposely do (43:08 - 43:12)
this it's really manipulat (43:10 - 43:14)
manipulative if let's say the first time (43:12 - 43:16)
bonus didn't exist (43:14 - 43:20)
so a it's 12 20 plus 130 (43:16 - 43:24)
right which is 13.50 (43:20 - 43:28)
for 20. the cramer ant skin (43:24 - 43:31)
is thirteen seventy (43:28 - 43:34)
if that bonus didn't exist and you spent (43:31 - 43:35)
twenty dollars you are (43:34 - 43:39)
twenty gems short of being able to buy (43:35 - 43:41)
the cramer ant skin (43:39 - 43:44)
you would have to either go up or do you (43:41 - 43:47)
have to make another purchase (43:44 - 43:50)
this is you know the uh card fight (43:47 - 43:51)
vanguard (43:50 - 43:54)
gotcha game does something very similar (43:51 - 43:55)
where (43:54 - 43:58)
you can buy gems that you can use to do (43:55 - 44:01)
pulls to get cards in the game but let's (43:58 - 44:02)
say (44:01 - 44:04)
you it's like ten dollars for a thousand (44:02 - 44:05)
gems (44:04 - 44:08)
you put in ten dollars you get 750 of (44:05 - 44:09)
the good (44:08 - 44:13)
gems for pulls and then 250 of the not (44:09 - 44:14)
as good gems (44:13 - 44:18)
and i'm like but i put in 10 of all cash (44:14 - 44:20)
there's a bunch that do like that um i (44:18 - 44:22)
also want to point out like outfits so (44:20 - 44:24)
i always try to compare it to final (44:22 - 44:26)
fantasy 14 so buying a full (44:24 - 44:31)
outfit in final fantasy 14 is 18 (44:26 - 44:34)
oh can we get even like (44:31 - 44:36)
currency complaints if this is our (44:34 - 44:39)
current arena (44:36 - 44:42)
the there is a talonflame outfit (44:39 - 44:44)
with a little pilot goggles and scarf (44:42 - 44:46)
which i (44:44 - 44:48)
absolutely have to have that is (44:46 - 44:49)
available (44:48 - 44:52)
as a reward from the energy canister (44:49 - 44:53)
which (44:52 - 44:56)
of course is only random drops yeah (44:53 - 45:00)
unless you pay for the energy tank (44:56 - 45:03)
yeah i the so the the costumes are (45:00 - 45:06)
different um the i (45:03 - 45:08)
and they don't do they don't do a super (45:06 - 45:10)
good job at like (45:08 - 45:13)
signifying that to a player who maybe (45:10 - 45:15)
hasn't played a (45:13 - 45:18)
cosmetic based game so like in apex i'm (45:15 - 45:19)
sorry (45:18 - 45:21)
apex is gonna be the game i compare to (45:19 - 45:23)
the most um in apex there's (45:21 - 45:26)
there's like blue purple (45:23 - 45:29)
and then gold for like the stuff you can (45:26 - 45:31)
and then there's like gray but gray is (45:29 - 45:33)
like the default so (45:31 - 45:36)
the the the blue you can still pay for (45:33 - 45:37)
you can (45:36 - 45:40)
you can pay real money or you can pay (45:37 - 45:42)
your blue currency that you earn (45:40 - 45:44)
crafting materials to unlock blue (45:42 - 45:47)
outfits and then purple outfits are like (45:44 - 45:49)
better designed i guess and they're more (45:47 - 45:51)
money and they're more currency and then (45:49 - 45:51)
the (45:51 - 45:54)
the gold outfits are like the outfits (45:51 - 45:54)
that like (45:54 - 45:56)
change the whole appearance they look (45:54 - 45:58)
really cool (45:56 - 46:01)
um and those are those are the 20 ones (45:58 - 46:03)
and the talonflame and the cinderace (46:01 - 46:06)
are comparable to the 20 (46:03 - 46:08)
ones because not only do they change the (46:06 - 46:09)
cinderace (46:08 - 46:11)
and the talonflame but they changed the (46:09 - 46:12)
pre-evolution pokemon (46:11 - 46:17)
before that too so like score like um (46:12 - 46:18)
fletching fletching where will have like (46:17 - 46:20)
little goggles on his head and then when (46:18 - 46:22)
he evolves into fletching dirt (46:20 - 46:24)
um the scarf shows up and stuff like (46:22 - 46:25)
each level of that (46:24 - 46:29)
whereas um (46:25 - 46:32)
what is a pokemon machamp machamp has (46:29 - 46:33)
the beach (46:32 - 46:36)
uh floaty around him or whatever and (46:33 - 46:37)
he's got a lay too (46:36 - 46:39)
yeah he has the lay but the machop and (46:37 - 46:41)
the machoke don't have (46:39 - 46:44)
anything at all yeah which i find super (46:41 - 46:45)
frustrating (46:44 - 46:47)
so it is literally the equivalent of (46:45 - 46:49)
like a legendary skin first like an epic (46:47 - 46:50)
skin (46:49 - 46:52)
but they they don't actually signify (46:50 - 46:54)
that besides just like (46:52 - 46:56)
price i don't necessarily have a problem (46:54 - 46:58)
with like (46:56 - 47:01)
like these super rare because like the (46:58 - 47:02)
the talonflame and the cinderace also (47:01 - 47:03)
have like a (47:02 - 47:06)
cutscene i don't know if you've saw that (47:03 - 47:08)
it has like this cutscene that happens (47:06 - 47:11)
um when you like hover over the skin (47:08 - 47:12)
it's really cool (47:11 - 47:14)
if you go into the store and or if you (47:12 - 47:15)
go into just like (47:14 - 47:17)
the character roster and you can flip (47:15 - 47:19)
between skins if you just hover above (47:17 - 47:22)
talonflame and cinderease's skin like (47:19 - 47:23)
you'll see cinderella's like (47:22 - 47:26)
swoop in on a ship and he'll like run (47:23 - 47:27)
around and it's like (47:26 - 47:29)
really awesome it's like a really good (47:27 - 47:30)
piece of animation talonflame has this (47:29 - 47:31)
too (47:30 - 47:32)
but then talonflame incinerates also (47:31 - 47:34)
unlock you a frame (47:32 - 47:36)
that you can like put and this is a (47:34 - 47:38)
thing that apex does too with like their (47:36 - 47:40)
heirlooms which are their super super (47:38 - 47:42)
rare thing i think an heirloom (47:40 - 47:44)
out of a loot box is one in 300 but it's (47:42 - 47:45)
really exciting because it gives your (47:44 - 47:46)
character like (47:45 - 47:48)
um an item they hold in their hand when (47:46 - 47:50)
they're running it doesn't do anything (47:48 - 47:51)
it's just cosmetic and then it gives you (47:50 - 47:53)
the exclusive skin and then it gives you (47:51 - 47:54)
an exclusive banner so (47:53 - 47:56)
unite does this too you get that like (47:54 - 47:58)
pirate banner or you get whatever (47:56 - 48:00)
talonflames flame banner is that you can (47:58 - 48:03)
put around your character itself (48:00 - 48:07)
um but cinderace's (48:03 - 48:10)
uh legendary or whatever skin is at the (48:07 - 48:12)
end of the battle pass (48:10 - 48:13)
and then talonflames is hidden in the (48:12 - 48:15)
loopbox so i would assume (48:13 - 48:18)
that eventually talonflames will move (48:15 - 48:22)
to a battle pass oh probably or (48:18 - 48:23)
there'll be a point where you can just (48:22 - 48:26)
straight up purchase it yeah (48:23 - 48:28)
but it's like it's whatever it's fine (48:26 - 48:29)
it's like a thing you chase (48:28 - 48:32)
i understand it's a reminder these do (48:29 - 48:33)
not (48:32 - 48:35)
change the gameplay experience of the (48:33 - 48:37)
actual character (48:35 - 48:40)
i mean i am foolishly chasing the elder (48:37 - 48:41)
goss coat for my character because i (48:40 - 48:43)
think it is the cutest thing i've ever (48:41 - 48:45)
seen and i want it (48:43 - 48:48)
so much that i did refill i did buy an (48:45 - 48:49)
extra tank (48:48 - 48:53)
to try to get it from the random drops (48:49 - 48:56)
i do i i do want to just disclose i said (48:53 - 48:57)
this on stream (48:56 - 48:59)
the pokemon company did send me a code (48:57 - 49:00)
for unite it came with the (48:59 - 49:04)
50 gem bonus so 3 500 gems (49:00 - 49:06)
so just full disclosure i have not spent (49:04 - 49:08)
that money i spent my own twenty dollars (49:06 - 49:09)
i bought the crime rate scan about a (49:08 - 49:10)
cramer ant (49:09 - 49:12)
um i have not spent that money but i (49:10 - 49:13)
just want to disclose they did send me (49:12 - 49:15)
have you gotten your name yet (49:13 - 49:18)
uh i didn't i did i didn't respond to (49:15 - 49:19)
them (49:18 - 49:21)
yeah they they held my name they held a (49:19 - 49:22)
bunch of content creators names like (49:21 - 49:23)
cerebe (49:22 - 49:26)
uh had their name held because when i (49:23 - 49:27)
like logged in that night i went to do (49:26 - 49:29)
pkmncass and it said (49:27 - 49:32)
this name is unavailable and then i was (49:29 - 49:32)
like (49:32 - 49:34)
uh did somebody already take it and then (49:32 - 49:36)
i typed in steve and it was like this (49:34 - 49:36)
name is (49:36 - 49:39)
not or this name is already taken and i (49:36 - 49:40)
was like oh well that's a different (49:39 - 49:40)
message (49:40 - 49:42)
yeah yeah i was like am i on some (49:40 - 49:43)
blacklist yes (49:42 - 49:46)
so i got sbj which i thought was like (49:43 - 49:47)
sweet i was like oh three (49:46 - 49:50)
letters sbj so i got that so when they (49:47 - 49:52)
were then the next day they were like (49:50 - 49:53)
oh we held your name and here's some (49:52 - 49:55)
gems that we hope you enjoyed the game i (49:53 - 49:57)
was like oh that's really nice but also (49:55 - 50:00)
i kind of like just having sbj that's (49:57 - 50:01)
pretty sweet (50:00 - 50:03)
my is what is going to always be (50:01 - 50:04)
branding yeah (50:03 - 50:06)
yeah i know always be true look no one's (50:04 - 50:08)
going to play me and unite and be like (50:06 - 50:09)
wow that guy sucks let me (50:08 - 50:12)
check out his podcast i mean i i will (50:09 - 50:14)
say that i have seen people who've (50:12 - 50:16)
played against (50:14 - 50:18)
in other types of games against a (50:16 - 50:20)
streamer who have come in to say (50:18 - 50:22)
hey that's super fun that was a great (50:20 - 50:24)
match i'm gonna hang around and see (50:22 - 50:27)
like i i will not be on board saying (50:24 - 50:28)
that (50:27 - 50:30)
people don't get things off of the (50:28 - 50:31)
branding that they see (50:30 - 50:35)
in a competitive game online (50:31 - 50:35)
my issue is as i was typing in my name (50:35 - 50:39)
and not paying attention (50:37 - 50:41)
i did not notice that there's a 10 (50:39 - 50:43)
character limit (50:41 - 50:47)
and my typical branding (50:43 - 50:50)
is 11 characters so it left off that (50:47 - 50:51)
last character and i (50:50 - 50:54)
locked it in you can pay the (50:51 - 50:57)
however much to change it nope we are (50:54 - 50:58)
washing the sin (50:57 - 51:01)
for our pokemon united which i really (50:58 - 51:03)
actually like (51:01 - 51:07)
i was like oh there it is okay greg you (51:03 - 51:09)
you okay so before we move to how much (51:07 - 51:10)
money greg put in (51:09 - 51:14)
the cramaran outfit is 20 the only other (51:10 - 51:16)
two outfits that exist (51:14 - 51:19)
were the snorlax outfit (51:16 - 51:24)
and the talonflame outfit both are (51:19 - 51:27)
554 gems which i think is close to ten (51:24 - 51:28)
dollars (51:27 - 51:32)
uh because the cramer was 13.70 um (51:28 - 51:35)
and i don't know (51:32 - 51:40)
why the cramer ant is double the price (51:35 - 51:43)
because it doesn't do anything special (51:40 - 51:45)
instead it's actually kind of a bad (51:43 - 51:47)
outfit as somebody who's paid 20 (51:45 - 51:50)
for this outfit i'm upset it forces your (51:47 - 51:51)
character to be blonde (51:50 - 51:53)
like i have black hair if you're (51:51 - 51:55)
watching the youtube video feel free to (51:53 - 51:56)
like subscribe i have (51:55 - 52:01)
dark hair and the i i think i get why it (51:56 - 52:02)
does the blonde hair because it's (52:01 - 52:04)
supposed to like blend in with the beak (52:02 - 52:04)
yeah (52:04 - 52:06)
and it's supposed to represent the beak (52:04 - 52:08)
i think the crystal cap gives you (52:06 - 52:11)
blue hair yeah it does it does it does (52:08 - 52:13)
but if i'm paying 20 this is the (52:11 - 52:16)
most expensive character outfit and it (52:13 - 52:18)
forces me to be blonde it's really (52:16 - 52:18)
frustrating (52:18 - 52:20)
they're never going to change it i (52:18 - 52:22)
thought so when i saw that (52:20 - 52:24)
and i saw you complain about bob i think (52:22 - 52:25)
the isn't the idea supposed to be like (52:24 - 52:27)
you're in its mouth like you're the fish (52:25 - 52:28)
being spit out like (52:27 - 52:30)
it's supposed to represent its open (52:28 - 52:32)
mouth and you're trapped inside (52:30 - 52:34)
like that's that's the feel i got from (52:32 - 52:35)
it so i'm like oh yeah i can see why (52:34 - 52:37)
they changed the hair color (52:35 - 52:39)
to match so it looks more like you are (52:37 - 52:41)
you have been gulped by the crammer ant (52:39 - 52:44)
and they're about to be spit out but i (52:41 - 52:45)
always get your frustration (52:44 - 52:48)
very weird i don't want blonde hair to (52:45 - 52:49)
be like we're (52:48 - 52:51)
forcing your hair to be different yeah (52:49 - 52:54)
it is a little weird (52:51 - 52:54)
for twenty dollars (52:54 - 52:57)
more options than the the ten dollar (52:58 - 53:01)
options (53:01 - 53:05)
like what uh greg how much money did you (53:01 - 53:06)
spend (53:05 - 53:10)
uh i did the 1999 (53:06 - 53:13)
125 plus 125 bundle the top (53:10 - 53:16)
yeah the 12 1200 plus 1200 yeah yeah (53:13 - 53:16)
yeah (53:16 - 53:20)
uh i did that i paid that i put that (53:16 - 53:20)
money in (53:20 - 53:23)
that's all i've put in so far you were (53:20 - 53:28)
against putting money in last week so (53:23 - 53:30)
uh here's the thing like i put money (53:28 - 53:32)
into dragalia lost (53:30 - 53:35)
because if i feel like the game has (53:32 - 53:38)
ultimately respected my time (53:35 - 53:41)
or or treats me fairly well for the time (53:38 - 53:43)
that i've put in (53:41 - 53:46)
then i'm like okay i will pay money into (53:43 - 53:50)
to to get fluff things to get extra (53:46 - 53:52)
content like things that don't really (53:50 - 53:53)
change the game so (53:52 - 53:55)
it was a really good deal i'm like i'm (53:53 - 53:56)
having i'm (53:55 - 53:58)
i'm definitely having this much amount (53:56 - 54:01)
of fun i feel like (53:58 - 54:03)
i i don't like the caps that they have (54:01 - 54:05)
like i don't like that things cap out (54:03 - 54:07)
during the week but i get why they did (54:05 - 54:11)
it but i felt like (54:07 - 54:16)
the rewards from the battle pass plus (54:11 - 54:20)
were good enough for the price (54:16 - 54:23)
and i'm having enough fun (54:20 - 54:26)
that i'll make a one-time i i'm having (54:23 - 54:27)
enough fun that (54:26 - 54:29)
if i was at target i would have bought (54:27 - 54:31)
this for twenty dollars (54:29 - 54:34)
if i had to buy a code and play it (54:31 - 54:36)
i am having enough fun that i would have (54:34 - 54:38)
walked into target and said give me that (54:36 - 54:40)
for 20 bucks (54:38 - 54:43)
easy easy deal done (54:40 - 54:44)
and obviously you bought the battle pass (54:43 - 54:46)
i bought the battle pass (54:44 - 54:49)
plus whatever the oh never did the (54:46 - 54:50)
battle pass (54:49 - 54:52)
plus and the battle pass plus i did the (54:50 - 54:54)
plus because i liked what the plus items (54:52 - 54:54)
were (54:54 - 54:57)
in the list that it showed me it's the (54:54 - 54:59)
same things you just get yeah 10 levels (54:57 - 54:59)
above (54:59 - 55:03)
faster yeah i used to do for i wanted to (54:59 - 55:03)
get those (55:03 - 55:06)
i wanted to get those faster apex (55:03 - 55:07)
fortnite (55:06 - 55:09)
call of duty they all have battle pass (55:07 - 55:10)
pluses it's just you get a level jump (55:09 - 55:11)
right (55:10 - 55:12)
off the bat it's it's the it's the clash (55:11 - 55:15)
royale thing (55:12 - 55:17)
in unite foreign like i want those (55:15 - 55:19)
things and i want them a little faster (55:17 - 55:22)
and it i think the price was worth it i (55:19 - 55:25)
i think i think that was like the one (55:22 - 55:27)
okay thing they did is you can't even (55:25 - 55:29)
access the battle pass until you get to (55:27 - 55:33)
level five yeah so you would think like (55:29 - 55:35)
well we already talked about how the gem (55:33 - 55:36)
system sucks (55:35 - 55:38)
it's very obscure and you would think (55:36 - 55:40)
they would be they would be like hey get (55:38 - 55:41)
this battle pass right away but they you (55:40 - 55:42)
do (55:41 - 55:43)
i mean it's not long you have to play (55:42 - 55:45)
like an hour to get to level five or (55:43 - 55:46)
something like that (55:45 - 55:48)
um but you can't get the battle pass (55:46 - 55:50)
right away i think the battle pass is (55:48 - 55:50)
like (55:50 - 55:52)
in my opinion of having battle passes in (55:50 - 55:55)
other games clash royale apex etc (55:52 - 55:58)
uh i think it's kind of bad it is full (55:55 - 56:00)
of like (55:58 - 56:02)
cosmetics that i would just it's the (56:00 - 56:04)
same problem apex has they just fill it (56:02 - 56:05)
with a bunch of stuff you you're just (56:04 - 56:07)
never going to use like i'm never going (56:05 - 56:07)
to (56:07 - 56:08)
equip these socks i'm never going to (56:07 - 56:09)
equip these shorts i'm never going to (56:08 - 56:10)
equip this like (56:09 - 56:13)
generic blue shirt like i i gave you (56:10 - 56:14)
twenty dollars for a crammer and outfit (56:13 - 56:15)
i'm gonna wear that (56:14 - 56:16)
i'm never gonna wear any of these other (56:15 - 56:18)
clothes when you get near the end of the (56:16 - 56:20)
battle pass you start getting a pikachu (56:18 - 56:20)
outfit (56:20 - 56:22)
you get like the pikachu now that like (56:20 - 56:24)
the pikachu ears are cool (56:22 - 56:26)
yeah and like the pikachu hoodie is cool (56:24 - 56:27)
and obviously the skinner (56:26 - 56:31)
cinderace special skin or whatever (56:27 - 56:34)
that's cool cinderella but like (56:31 - 56:36)
there's so much filler in that battle (56:34 - 56:38)
pass (56:36 - 56:40)
that it's like not a great first battle (56:38 - 56:43)
pass but we'll see in 60 days (56:40 - 56:46)
huge mistake was making the black (56:43 - 56:48)
t-shirt in black shorts (56:46 - 56:50)
one of the first like free things that i (56:48 - 56:51)
unlocked because i was like (56:50 - 56:54)
set done look i am (56:51 - 56:56)
i am hunting the elder elder glass (56:54 - 56:58)
outfit i want the pants (56:56 - 57:00)
i want i really want the jacket i want (56:58 - 57:01)
the jacket more than anything (57:00 - 57:04)
i kind of want the shoes uh but i really (57:01 - 57:05)
want that jacket (57:04 - 57:08)
and i am i am on the hunt for that (57:05 - 57:09)
jacket and i'm upset that i haven't (57:08 - 57:10)
gotten it yet (57:09 - 57:12)
and when people show up if you show up (57:10 - 57:14)
in that outfit and i don't have it yet (57:12 - 57:16)
you are not getting a good job for me (57:14 - 57:19)
no matter how well you did you you are (57:16 - 57:20)
not getting it i'm mad at you (57:19 - 57:23)
will how much money did you put in zero (57:20 - 57:25)
so no battle pass for you (57:23 - 57:28)
no no i (57:25 - 57:31)
if i'm gonna buy anything it's gonna be (57:28 - 57:32)
the ability to (57:31 - 57:34)
uh acquire the held items and upgrade (57:32 - 57:36)
the held items because that's what (57:34 - 57:38)
actually helps you to win the game (57:36 - 57:40)
yeah but the battle pass has the things (57:38 - 57:42)
you need to upgrade the items (57:40 - 57:45)
well but it has other stuff i don't want (57:42 - 57:48)
so i'm just honestly so my evaluation is (57:45 - 57:50)
yes i very much agree with the (57:48 - 57:52)
philosophy that (57:50 - 57:53)
if you're playing a free-to-play game (57:52 - 57:55)
and you're playing it a lot (57:53 - 57:57)
that throw the people who made the game (57:55 - 57:59)
some money they deserve it because (57:57 - 58:00)
they've made a game (57:59 - 58:04)
if i am sitting down by myself and not (58:00 - 58:06)
with one of my friends who loves to play (58:04 - 58:08)
mobas (58:06 - 58:11)
i play monster hunter stories i'm not (58:08 - 58:13)
going to play unite i play unite because (58:11 - 58:14)
it is (58:13 - 58:17)
literally the thing that brings me and (58:14 - 58:19)
two of my friends who play two different (58:17 - 58:22)
mobas we can play this one together (58:19 - 58:24)
so it hasn't reached the point where i (58:22 - 58:26)
would want to give it money (58:24 - 58:29)
i i enjoy playing it i enjoy playing (58:26 - 58:30)
snorlax (58:29 - 58:32)
i don't need to pay money i already got (58:30 - 58:33)
my float stone upgraded so (58:32 - 58:38)
yeah snoglax is doing fine i realized (58:33 - 58:42)
uh as i was talking to a friend of mine (58:38 - 58:44)
because i it came out and i was playing (58:42 - 58:45)
it (58:44 - 58:48)
on wednesday and they texted me like did (58:45 - 58:49)
you take today off (58:48 - 58:52)
i'm like no i'm literally doing it on (58:49 - 58:54)
conference calls where i don't have to (58:52 - 58:55)
pay attention like (58:54 - 58:58)
i realized after the first day that i am (58:55 - 59:01)
playing this (58:58 - 59:04)
solo i'm going into ranked battles by (59:01 - 59:08)
myself to learn how to play this game (59:04 - 59:10)
this is not my normal experience for (59:08 - 59:11)
these types of games (59:10 - 59:15)
i'm really into this game and therefore (59:11 - 59:16)
i'm going to give it money like i made (59:15 - 59:18)
the decision at the end of the day (59:16 - 59:21)
on wednesday i'm like i've been playing (59:18 - 59:21)
this (59:21 - 59:25)
all day i have been playing this (59:21 - 59:25)
by myself without my friends (59:26 - 59:32)
i have been playing this game i'm mad (59:30 - 59:33)
that i have to stop (59:32 - 59:35)
playing to go do a recording that i (59:33 - 59:37)
agreed to do (59:35 - 59:40)
i i am very into this game and even if (59:37 - 59:43)
after a week that i have i've stopped it (59:40 - 59:45)
and said it's too frustrating (59:43 - 59:47)
for that week and just for those few (59:45 - 59:48)
days i'm like you have (59:47 - 59:50)
definitely impressed me i will (59:48 - 59:54)
definitely give this money (59:50 - 59:54)
speaking of money uh i i did buy one (59:54 - 59:59)
character i bought cramer ant obviously (59:57 - 60:00)
not a lot of people have cramer ant it (59:59 - 60:02)
wasn't one of the free options that you (60:00 - 60:03)
could pick off the bat (60:02 - 60:05)
the characters are different prices so (60:03 - 60:06)
for example absol (60:05 - 60:08)
is ten thousand coins or or or about (60:06 - 60:10)
seven bucks (60:08 - 60:12)
um alolan nine tails is only eight (60:10 - 60:14)
thousand coins or about six dollars (60:12 - 60:16)
charizard is six thousand coins or about (60:14 - 60:17)
five dollars (60:16 - 60:20)
um i did ask people who played league (60:17 - 60:22)
this is or not league um (60:20 - 60:24)
is it it's league league uh yes because (60:22 - 60:26)
league has character rotation so every (60:24 - 60:27)
week in league there's like two (60:26 - 60:28)
characters you can play (60:27 - 60:31)
for free which this game has this week (60:28 - 60:33)
it's like (60:31 - 60:36)
ma chop or sorry yeah (60:33 - 60:39)
machop and um gibbel or sorry garchomp (60:36 - 60:41)
and (60:39 - 60:43)
why can't i machamp i was like why can't (60:41 - 60:45)
i remember machop's evolution (60:43 - 60:47)
uh those are those are free to play for (60:45 - 60:49)
the week and those will rotate which is (60:47 - 60:51)
nice because you get to (60:49 - 60:53)
um you get to see if you even like these (60:51 - 60:55)
characters or not and then (60:53 - 60:56)
they did say in league that some (60:55 - 60:58)
characters are just more money than (60:56 - 60:59)
other characters to unlock i think (60:58 - 61:01)
league has like what like 80 some (60:59 - 61:03)
characters at this point but they they (61:01 - 61:05)
said like older characters will go on (61:03 - 61:06)
sale (61:05 - 61:08)
or or new powerful characters will (61:06 - 61:09)
always be (61:08 - 61:10)
10 000 coins or whatever the most (61:09 - 61:12)
expensive so (61:10 - 61:14)
that doesn't seem too uncommon in in (61:12 - 61:15)
that regards (61:14 - 61:18)
but like going back to like the buying (61:15 - 61:19)
characters because there is a lot (61:18 - 61:21)
there's just some characters like i (61:19 - 61:23)
don't ever plan on buying like i just (61:21 - 61:26)
didn't enjoy machamp at all (61:23 - 61:28)
to the point where i like i'm just not (61:26 - 61:29)
gonna spend the eight thousand coins on (61:28 - 61:30)
my champ (61:29 - 61:32)
like i if he's free for the week i'll (61:30 - 61:35)
play him it's a good character though (61:32 - 61:37)
but his speedy tasty attacks but that's (61:35 - 61:38)
not my playstyle (61:37 - 61:40)
and like like venusaur was another one (61:38 - 61:42)
where i was like (61:40 - 61:43)
venusaur and cinderellas have the same (61:42 - 61:45)
thing that i just hate in games where (61:43 - 61:47)
they have like this long range thing (61:45 - 61:48)
that you have to aim (61:47 - 61:51)
and if you miss it you you just lose (61:48 - 61:52)
like you (61:51 - 61:54)
you missed your shot and you're done for (61:52 - 61:56)
it and i like crammer ant because cramer (61:54 - 61:57)
ant does (61:56 - 61:59)
camera ant has like a lot of aoes um (61:57 - 62:01)
like the ao the only aoe he doesn't have (61:59 - 62:03)
is dive which i don't run dive i run (62:01 - 62:06)
whirlpool i run surf and hurricane (62:03 - 62:09)
um but even with dive even though that's (62:06 - 62:11)
not an aoe you don't really miss it (62:09 - 62:12)
because he like (62:11 - 62:16)
he goes right to the target um anyways (62:12 - 62:17)
so i don't know maybe because i'm just a (62:16 - 62:19)
bad player and i'm just i don't (62:17 - 62:20)
i can't aim like i can't aim (62:19 - 62:22)
cinderella's blaze kick i can't aim (62:20 - 62:25)
venusaur solar beam mad props to people (62:22 - 62:26)
who can there's (62:25 - 62:27)
there's a practice tutorial for that (62:26 - 62:29)
that you can do my (62:27 - 62:33)
so actually just in a gameplay mechanics (62:29 - 62:36)
thing i have found that playing with the (62:33 - 62:38)
pro controller i can aim with the r (62:36 - 62:38)
stick (62:38 - 62:41)
much easier than if i'm playing with the (62:38 - 62:41)
joy cons (62:41 - 62:44)
oh my only pro controller uh the (62:41 - 62:45)
responsiveness (62:44 - 62:48)
of attacks i find is much faster on the (62:45 - 62:49)
joy cons (62:48 - 62:53)
because the buttons are smaller so it's (62:49 - 62:56)
lower uh press rate i heard somebody say (62:53 - 62:57)
this and i (62:56 - 62:59)
a million percent agree with them i (62:57 - 63:01)
can't tell if the controls are (62:59 - 63:04)
too loose or (63:01 - 63:07)
too tight in what's like (63:04 - 63:09)
i feel like when i'm aiming i'm like do (63:07 - 63:11)
i want this to be like (63:09 - 63:13)
a little slower or do i want this to be (63:11 - 63:15)
a little faster so like (63:13 - 63:18)
here's the question it feels slightly (63:15 - 63:21)
off and i can't tell which way it feels (63:18 - 63:22)
off are you (63:21 - 63:25)
when you aim are you doing process hold (63:22 - 63:27)
down attack button (63:25 - 63:30)
twirl joy-con yeah or (63:27 - 63:33)
are you doing moving with top joy-con (63:30 - 63:33)
holding (63:33 - 63:35)
the r button and then moving bottom (63:33 - 63:37)
joy-con to aim just like in a shooter (63:35 - 63:41)
okay so what you need to get to pro tips (63:37 - 63:44)
is hold the attack button knock the (63:41 - 63:45)
right joy-con (63:44 - 63:47)
in the direction you want to go and (63:45 - 63:50)
release don't don't swirl it to kind of (63:47 - 63:52)
aim it into you've got to know and just (63:50 - 63:54)
knock that thing oh god okay all right (63:52 - 63:56)
i'll try that i knock and release (63:54 - 63:59)
it's like the radial menus in monster (63:56 - 64:00)
hunter (63:59 - 64:02)
right although the what makes those (64:00 - 64:04)
easier is you're holding the other side (64:02 - 64:07)
like you're holding the left trigger and (64:04 - 64:08)
then moving the right (64:07 - 64:10)
joy con to do the radial monster menus (64:08 - 64:12)
in in monster hunter (64:10 - 64:14)
but it's more difficult because both (64:12 - 64:15)
things are on the right side (64:14 - 64:17)
so unless you can reprogram that uh (64:15 - 64:18)
maybe (64:17 - 64:20)
i did the thing so i played i played (64:18 - 64:22)
standard controls eight hours or (64:20 - 64:22)
whatever (64:22 - 64:24)
ten hours the first day and then i did (64:22 - 64:27)
the thing where i changed where like (64:24 - 64:29)
this is one attack and then this is the (64:27 - 64:31)
other attack because initially these are (64:29 - 64:32)
the two attacks (64:31 - 64:34)
yeah sorry that makes it harder to (64:32 - 64:35)
harder to aim because (64:34 - 64:37)
they're both on the right side so yeah (64:35 - 64:38)
hold the attack and (64:37 - 64:41)
knock the knob because your your your (64:38 - 64:42)
hands naturally fall on (64:41 - 64:45)
zr and rz or zr (64:42 - 64:49)
and zl your your your fingers naturally (64:45 - 64:50)
fall in those so (64:49 - 64:53)
that's where i put the two attacks and (64:50 - 64:56)
i had to relearn but it's it's way (64:53 - 64:56)
better (64:56 - 64:59)
because then then this this your right (64:56 - 64:59)
hand (64:59 - 65:02)
is doing so much it spreads it out and (64:59 - 65:03)
it feels like um (65:02 - 65:05)
i don't know it feels like a normal game (65:03 - 65:08)
so i put for support i put the (65:05 - 65:13)
damage move on the zr (65:08 - 65:16)
and i put my heel move on the r (65:13 - 65:18)
because i i don't naturally hit that (65:16 - 65:19)
button (65:18 - 65:21)
so it stops me from accidentally hitting (65:19 - 65:22)
it so i have to be (65:21 - 65:25)
more deliberate on okay i have to move (65:22 - 65:27)
up and hit my heel now and i don't have (65:25 - 65:28)
to think i have to (65:27 - 65:32)
heal and use my other hand it is here (65:28 - 65:35)
and then when i want to i know i have to (65:32 - 65:36)
do the heel i can quickly (65:35 - 65:38)
bump up and i don't have to do a lot of (65:36 - 65:39)
things the things that i'm really not (65:38 - 65:41)
good at is aiming i am (65:39 - 65:43)
terrible at aiming i did switch it so (65:41 - 65:44)
that the a button attacks (65:43 - 65:48)
opponents and the b button attacks wild (65:44 - 65:50)
so that yeah i can do that pretty good (65:48 - 65:51)
now (65:50 - 65:55)
uh i think but yeah it the controls get (65:51 - 65:56)
a little bit and i (65:55 - 65:58)
i am with you i'm terrible at aiming but (65:56 - 65:59)
luckily that (65:58 - 66:01)
even if i don't aim correctly with (65:59 - 66:03)
pollen puff which i usually run (66:01 - 66:05)
i just have to get it into an area where (66:03 - 66:07)
either an enemy is coming from or you're (66:05 - 66:08)
going to (66:07 - 66:09)
and we all get a benefit from it no (66:08 - 66:12)
matter what i think the reason i can't (66:09 - 66:12)
flick (66:12 - 66:14)
i was thinking about this will is like (66:12 - 66:15)
with cinderace and soul (66:14 - 66:17)
and and venusaur you have that like long (66:15 - 66:19)
range move (66:17 - 66:21)
and you flick in that direction but with (66:19 - 66:22)
kramer ant (66:21 - 66:25)
i'm placing a circle where hurricane is (66:22 - 66:26)
going to go (66:25 - 66:28)
oh i'll throw them up in an air so i (66:26 - 66:29)
have to kind of like (66:28 - 66:32)
i i don't need it to go super far like (66:29 - 66:33)
when i'm getting chased i i actually (66:32 - 66:35)
have to put it like right behind my butt (66:33 - 66:36)
because that's where they're going to (66:35 - 66:37)
end up (66:36 - 66:39)
and if i put it too far they've already (66:37 - 66:41)
run past it so i feel like i have to (66:39 - 66:43)
hold that button to like (66:41 - 66:46)
place the circle in the circle (66:43 - 66:48)
to make it a little easier to to hold (66:46 - 66:50)
the button to (66:48 - 66:52)
aim and then use your like put the put (66:50 - 66:54)
it on the left side to do (66:52 - 66:58)
the activate the the attack and then (66:54 - 66:59)
that way you're doing two different (66:58 - 67:01)
hands so you'd use your right hand for (66:59 - 67:03)
targeting your left hand for activating (67:01 - 67:06)
the attack that might make it easier (67:03 - 67:06)
yeah or i just give up that i'm never (67:07 - 67:11)
gonna be good at cramer (67:10 - 67:13)
no i mean i had the same problem with (67:11 - 67:15)
pollen puffs like i have to throw up (67:13 - 67:16)
behind me sometimes and i'm like this (67:15 - 67:17)
isn't going to happen (67:16 - 67:19)
i'm just throwing it on because i get (67:17 - 67:20)
the speed boost there are some settings (67:19 - 67:23)
and i change all the settings where like (67:20 - 67:25)
um one is like so you can like move and (67:23 - 67:26)
then aim (67:25 - 67:28)
and that's like a toggle uh otherwise (67:26 - 67:30)
and then there's like some smart (67:28 - 67:31)
settings where like the game will try to (67:30 - 67:33)
like (67:31 - 67:36)
auto aim for you and sometimes that (67:33 - 67:37)
messes it up (67:36 - 67:39)
um there's there's some weird stuff yeah (67:37 - 67:40)
oh yeah there's nothing like (67:39 - 67:43)
uh having three of your opponents (67:40 - 67:45)
running towards you and your bros (67:43 - 67:47)
and you hit attack and you jump over on (67:45 - 67:48)
it at an audino (67:47 - 67:51)
yeah i hate that okay so some people (67:48 - 67:52)
have (67:51 - 67:54)
this circle on the side that's got the (67:52 - 67:56)
characters yeah pies what is that i (67:54 - 67:58)
i don't know what that um so it's just a (67:56 - 68:00)
toggle in settings i don't remember what (67:58 - 68:01)
toggle it is (68:00 - 68:04)
it's like it's like ripple you know the (68:01 - 68:05)
there's the (68:04 - 68:07)
there's the advanced setting which is (68:05 - 68:08)
you can hit a (68:07 - 68:10)
you can hit a to attack everyone or you (68:08 - 68:12)
can hit a to attack (68:10 - 68:16)
people and b to attack right uh (68:12 - 68:18)
enemies and that's that messed me up so (68:16 - 68:19)
badly (68:18 - 68:23)
because when you're when you spend 10 (68:19 - 68:25)
hours just hitting the a button (68:23 - 68:27)
and then you change that to like oh now (68:25 - 68:29)
i have to hit the b button and then when (68:27 - 68:30)
you're getting attacked by enemies (68:29 - 68:31)
you're (68:30 - 68:32)
at least for me i was like still hitting (68:31 - 68:34)
b button but it they're not enemies (68:32 - 68:36)
they're real people so you're not doing (68:34 - 68:39)
anything but then i realized (68:36 - 68:42)
that oh you can still hit the a button (68:39 - 68:42)
it will (68:42 - 68:46)
do uh and it will do bots (68:42 - 68:48)
but when a person shows up it will (68:46 - 68:50)
default to that yeah and the reason you (68:48 - 68:51)
would want that on (68:50 - 68:54)
is because the game only cares about (68:51 - 68:55)
last hit (68:54 - 68:58)
so you don't want to default attack (68:55 - 69:01)
like roton or yeah rotom because you (68:58 - 69:02)
might want to wait (69:01 - 69:05)
and then get the last hit in so there's (69:02 - 69:07)
a reason to have that on and (69:05 - 69:09)
once you learn it it's it's worth having (69:07 - 69:10)
on but you can continue (69:09 - 69:12)
spamming the a button the other thing i (69:10 - 69:14)
didn't realize is even though b (69:12 - 69:17)
is attacking enemies or bots only when (69:14 - 69:18)
you wanted to (69:17 - 69:20)
bots being like the audit no's and stuff (69:18 - 69:21)
sorry (69:20 - 69:22)
for people who maybe don't know that (69:21 - 69:24)
language um (69:22 - 69:28)
it also cancels your move so i would (69:24 - 69:29)
like (69:28 - 69:32)
hurricane or i would surf but then i (69:29 - 69:34)
would go back to hitting b (69:32 - 69:36)
to like finish attacking the audino and (69:34 - 69:37)
then my hurricane and my surf would (69:36 - 69:39)
never activate (69:37 - 69:41)
and then i was like what is my game (69:39 - 69:43)
broken what's happening but because i (69:41 - 69:43)
was (69:43 - 69:45)
i was hitting the surf button and then (69:43 - 69:47)
hitting b so fast it was literally just (69:45 - 69:48)
canceling out my surf (69:47 - 69:51)
and it took me like four hours to like (69:48 - 69:53)
what am i doing wrong like why is my (69:51 - 69:53)
circuit (69:53 - 69:55)
like so like i turned it off and i was (69:53 - 69:57)
like okay everything's normal again (69:55 - 69:59)
and then i realized oh like even though (69:57 - 70:01)
it's saying b is attacking bots (69:59 - 70:04)
it is still cancelling your other attack (70:01 - 70:05)
well (70:04 - 70:06)
i don't know how fast other pokemon (70:05 - 70:08)
attack but kramer ant there's like a (70:06 - 70:10)
small wind-up for hurricane and four (70:08 - 70:12)
surf (70:10 - 70:15)
um so once you get over all that it's (70:12 - 70:15)
like (70:15 - 70:18)
fine but there's a lot like i guess (70:15 - 70:19)
that's a good thing about the game like (70:18 - 70:21)
you can really customize (70:19 - 70:23)
the controls and you probably should (70:21 - 70:26)
yeah (70:23 - 70:26)
okay uh let's take a break yep (70:27 - 70:33)
so we'll be right back (70:30 - 70:33)
what is a nidoran supposed to be it's a (70:35 - 70:39)
mix of (70:38 - 70:42)
porcupine a rabbit dinosaurs mouse (70:39 - 70:45)
whales jackalope probably a horse and (70:42 - 70:46)
hamster (70:45 - 70:49)
porcupine a rabbit dinosaur is a (70:46 - 70:50)
mountain (70:49 - 70:54)
whales jackalopes probably a horse (70:50 - 70:58)
yeah but then like what then what are (70:54 - 71:12)
[Music] (70:58 - 71:15)
whales jacqueline probably a horse and (71:12 - 71:16)
hamster (71:15 - 71:19)
[Music] (71:16 - 71:19)
and we are back from our break (71:20 - 71:25)
before we talk about the pay to win that (71:23 - 71:27)
is pokemon unite uh (71:25 - 71:31)
it is podcast award season (71:27 - 71:33)

listening to us on (71:33 - 71:37)
july 26 you have a few days look you're (71:34 - 71:39)
gonna forget (71:37 - 71:41)
and uh i did a very bad job at promoting (71:39 - 71:43)
this this month so (71:41 - 71:45)
so i need you all look you would have (71:43 - 71:46)
waited last minute anyways it doesn't (71:45 - 71:47)
matter (71:46 - 71:49)
yeah do you have to go to (71:47 - 71:51)
podcastawards.com (71:49 - 71:54)
log in with a new account because (71:51 - 71:55)
apparently (71:54 - 71:57)
the three of us tested this earlier and (71:55 - 71:58)
all the accounts don't exist from last (71:57 - 71:59)
year (71:58 - 72:02)
yep so make a brand new account name (71:59 - 72:03)
email (72:02 - 72:05)
password once you get past that you go (72:03 - 72:07)
to games and hobby you select it's super (72:05 - 72:08)
effective and then you hit vote (72:07 - 72:10)
and that's it you can select other shows (72:08 - 72:11)
for history or (72:10 - 72:15)
best female or best male all that stuff (72:11 - 72:16)
you can do all of that (72:15 - 72:20)
as well but we think of it as a (72:16 - 72:22)
happy eleven years it's super effective (72:20 - 72:24)
there you go we're gonna be 11 years (72:22 - 72:26)
we got nominated last year so thank you (72:24 - 72:28)
to everyone who helped nominate us last (72:26 - 72:30)
year we were in the finals last year we (72:28 - 72:31)
didn't win (72:30 - 72:33)
there's not a lot of competition in (72:31 - 72:35)
games and hobby this year (72:33 - 72:38)
so it probably takes maybe three minutes (72:35 - 72:40)
out of your day (72:38 - 72:42)
podcastawards.com click the button that (72:40 - 72:43)
says nominate (72:42 - 72:44)
make a fresh account i promise your (72:43 - 72:46)
account from last year doesn't exist (72:44 - 72:47)
make a new one we already tested this (72:46 - 72:48)
make a new one (72:47 - 72:50)
and then you just get a bunch of drop (72:48 - 72:52)
downs just drop down games and hobby (72:50 - 72:53)
it's super effective (72:52 - 72:54)
and then if you want to vote for other (72:53 - 72:56)
things feel free to and then hit submit (72:54 - 72:58)
that's it that's all you got to do (72:56 - 72:59)
the more people that do that there will (72:58 - 73:02)
be a second vote in august (72:59 - 73:04)
and so we need as many people to do it (73:02 - 73:06)
this week because when the second vote (73:04 - 73:07)
comes out in august (73:06 - 73:09)
we need you guys to get randomly (73:07 - 73:12)
selected for the second vote which is (73:09 - 73:13)
very weird but the more people that do (73:12 - 73:15)
it the more people that are in our favor (73:13 - 73:18)
for we we've tried to win this for like (73:15 - 73:21)
11 10 years at this point (73:18 - 73:24)
one day we will i think this is the year (73:21 - 73:25)
as long as everyone does it this week (73:24 - 73:27)
i'll remind you guys on twitch i'll (73:25 - 73:28)
remind you guys in slack i'll remind you (73:27 - 73:29)
of the discord (73:28 - 73:32)
um once you figure out that your email (73:29 - 73:34)
and password from last year doesn't work (73:32 - 73:35)
it's much easier (73:34 - 73:38)
yeah just make sure to hit that check (73:35 - 73:38)
box (73:38 - 73:40)
on when you create your account that (73:38 - 73:42)
says you want to be considered (73:40 - 73:45)
for placing a vote for the final roster (73:42 - 73:46)
i think by default it's checked right (73:45 - 73:48)
nope oh okay (73:46 - 73:50)
yeah well hit that checkbox too you want (73:48 - 73:53)
to be in the second vote (73:50 - 73:56)
you want to have the power to vote (73:53 - 73:58)
um so yeah that would really help us out (73:56 - 74:00)
if you if you do that also (73:58 - 74:02)
it is near the end of the month so i (74:00 - 74:04)

the end of september (75:50 - 75:54)
the end of august though sorry i think i (75:52 - 75:55)
said september the end of august though (75:54 - 75:56)
just because (75:55 - 75:58)
i'm going to get the shirts made locally (75:56 - 75:59)
uh and they (75:58 - 76:01)
they take like three weeks because they (75:59 - 76:02)
gotta approve it and they gotta press it (76:01 - 76:03)
and a lot of stuff (76:02 - 76:06)
so more details will come but um if you (76:03 - 76:08)
did sign up for patreon uh cool (76:06 - 76:10)
i hope you enjoy the slack and all the (76:08 - 76:12)
other stuff that comes with it and the (76:10 - 76:13)
bonus podcast and the (76:12 - 76:18)
that free and all that stuff okay (76:13 - 76:22)
pay to win pokemon unite (76:18 - 76:25)
when when pokemon unite came out i (76:22 - 76:26)
looked through everything and i was like (76:25 - 76:27)
this (76:26 - 76:29)
isn't paid to win because you can't okay (76:27 - 76:30)
so it is pay to win (76:29 - 76:33)
there's there's no sugar coating that (76:30 - 76:34)
but (76:33 - 76:36)
they they set it up in a way where it (76:34 - 76:39)
doesn't look like pay to win (76:36 - 76:41)
uh which is a little yes that's how they (76:39 - 76:42)
do it (76:41 - 76:45)
yes well normally no clash royale was (76:42 - 76:45)
never (76:45 - 76:49)
uh it's just like it's just like illegal (76:45 - 76:50)
drugs (76:49 - 76:52)
have a little taste have a little taste (76:50 - 76:53)
then you'd like you want more well the (76:52 - 76:55)
only way to get more is to throw some (76:53 - 76:59)
money and get these health items from (76:55 - 76:59)
clash royale was never shy about being (76:59 - 77:03)
paid to win no (77:01 - 77:05)
there okay the pay to win thing in this (77:03 - 77:07)
game is called item enhancer (77:05 - 77:10)
and if you if you click on it it is it (77:07 - 77:10)
is (77:10 - 77:13)
10 uh tickets i don't know what this (77:10 - 77:15)
currency aos tickets (77:13 - 77:18)
there's okay so there's eos gems there's (77:15 - 77:18)
ao (77:18 - 77:22)
eos coins and then there's eos tickets (77:18 - 77:25)
and in comparison if you wanted one of (77:22 - 77:27)
these held items like (77:25 - 77:30)
focus band it is either a thousand coins (77:27 - 77:32)
which is pretty easy to get i was able (77:30 - 77:34)
to get 10 000 coins the first day (77:32 - 77:34)
playing (77:34 - 77:38)
uh or 625 tickets so you (77:34 - 77:42)
cannot with real money by the focus band (77:38 - 77:44)
now when there was a huge article on our (77:42 - 77:46)
like r slash (77:44 - 77:48)
nintendo or something and it got a ton (77:46 - 77:49)
of upvotes and the guy complained that (77:48 - 77:51)
this game was really pay to win (77:49 - 77:55)
and he talked about these items (77:51 - 77:55)
so initially he's wrong right because (77:55 - 77:59)
you can't actually (77:58 - 78:01)
buy these items with money you can buy (77:59 - 78:03)
them with coins and tickets but you (78:01 - 78:04)
can't (78:03 - 78:07)
just put 50 in the game and buy these (78:04 - 78:08)
items (78:07 - 78:10)
but once you get the items they're (78:08 - 78:11)
permanently unlocked (78:10 - 78:15)
and there's only like 15 of them (78:11 - 78:17)
it's like scope lens muscle band wise (78:15 - 78:18)
glasses so far (78:17 - 78:21)
yes it's like a assault vest rocky (78:18 - 78:23)
helmet (78:21 - 78:26)
and you need the item enhancer (78:23 - 78:28)
which is only 10 tickets you can't use (78:26 - 78:30)
coins you can't use gems and you need (78:28 - 78:31)
the item enhancer to (78:30 - 78:34)
upgrade these items (78:31 - 78:39)
so at the surface level (78:34 - 78:40)
these are the these are the two things (78:39 - 78:42)
that equal (78:40 - 78:45)
the the winning right like you can buy (78:42 - 78:48)
characters right like eva in apex (78:45 - 78:50)
legends you could buy mirage you could (78:48 - 78:52)
buy caustic you could buy a rampart (78:50 - 78:54)
but you're not those aren't really paid (78:52 - 78:55)
to win they're just different characters (78:54 - 78:56)
in different play styles (78:55 - 78:58)
i mean i guess you could maybe argue (78:56 - 78:59)
that one character is more powerful than (78:58 - 79:01)
the other (78:59 - 79:05)
um until they get nerfed so (79:01 - 79:09)
if if these items were just unlocked (79:05 - 79:10)
through (79:09 - 79:12)
coins and tickets i think it would be (79:10 - 79:13)
fine (79:12 - 79:17)
but the problem is the item enhancer (79:13 - 79:20)
makes these items better (79:17 - 79:24)
and there's in my opinion (79:20 - 79:27)
a pretty significant difference and i (79:24 - 79:29)
think if you're a casual player (79:27 - 79:30)
you probably would shrug your shoulders (79:29 - 79:33)
and go oh that's not that big of a deal (79:30 - 79:35)
but at these high level plays or in (79:33 - 79:37)
matches (79:35 - 79:39)
when it comes down to like oh he had one (79:37 - 79:40)
hp left (79:39 - 79:43)
like that super matters and i wasn't (79:40 - 79:47)
super convinced the first day i played (79:43 - 79:49)
that these items mattered so much until (79:47 - 79:51)
there was a couple youtube videos that (79:49 - 79:52)
came out (79:51 - 79:55)
so one youtube video showed floatstone (79:52 - 79:57)
floatstone it says here (79:55 - 79:59)
item detail increases movement speed (79:57 - 80:01)
when not in combat (79:59 - 80:02)
so that sounds pretty good right because (80:01 - 80:04)
like when you die you gotta run back to (80:02 - 80:05)
an area (80:04 - 80:06)
and if you can get there faster that's (80:05 - 80:08)
better right like i don't think anyone's (80:06 - 80:09)
disagreeing with that that sounds pretty (80:08 - 80:11)
strong (80:09 - 80:14)
so a a level one float stone (80:11 - 80:16)
so the the youtuber put a level one (80:14 - 80:17)
float stone next to i think it was like (80:16 - 80:19)
a level 20 float stone (80:17 - 80:22)
and they showed the side by side and the (80:19 - 80:23)
character with the level 20 float stone (80:22 - 80:26)
got there like two seconds faster which (80:23 - 80:27)
is a (80:26 - 80:29)
pretty big deal in a 10 minute match in (80:27 - 80:31)
my opinion to get to an area two seconds (80:29 - 80:33)
faster to do what you need to do is a (80:31 - 80:34)
pretty big deal (80:33 - 80:36)
the more concerning thing for me i think (80:34 - 80:38)
it was muscle band which increases (80:36 - 80:39)
attack (80:38 - 80:40)
and i think this was a different youtube (80:39 - 80:42)
video but they put it side by side (80:40 - 80:44)
but they showed uh i think it was a (80:42 - 80:45)
gibble (80:44 - 80:47)
or a machop both with muscle band one (80:45 - 80:48)
had a level (80:47 - 80:50)
one muscle band and one had like a level (80:48 - 80:52)
20 muscle band (80:50 - 80:55)
and the one with the level one muscle (80:52 - 80:56)
band (80:55 - 80:59)
had to hit the audino three more times (80:56 - 81:01)
before it knocked out (80:59 - 81:04)
and that's a lot a moba like (81:01 - 81:07)
yeah like even you're like oh well (81:04 - 81:08)
that's only one audino and that's only (81:07 - 81:10)
three hits (81:08 - 81:12)
you're probably knocking out 20 some (81:10 - 81:13)
audinos (81:12 - 81:17)
in a 10 minute match i mean (81:13 - 81:21)
i upgraded xp share to level 10 (81:17 - 81:25)
and for my elder gus it gives me like (81:21 - 81:28)
i say it's like 60 or 70 (81:25 - 81:31)
more health and then i have the barrier (81:28 - 81:33)
that i also upgraded so (81:31 - 81:37)
i have like 120 extra health (81:33 - 81:40)
and there are new players who think they (81:37 - 81:41)
can attack me and wear me down and (81:40 - 81:44)
you'll get me down but i can hit my heel (81:41 - 81:45)
because i have a bigger health buffer (81:44 - 81:47)
than you're expecting (81:45 - 81:50)
and it makes a huge difference because i (81:47 - 81:51)
can kite you back (81:50 - 81:53)
to a bunch of people that are gonna (81:51 - 81:55)
murder you because you think (81:53 - 81:58)
oh this aldegast is going to go down (81:55 - 81:59)
soon because i (81:58 - 82:00)
fought other elder glasses and they (81:59 - 82:03)
don't have a lot of health well surprise (82:00 - 82:06)
i have paid i have used the items (82:03 - 82:10)
to increase my health on two items (82:06 - 82:13)
so i have a buffer you are not expecting (82:10 - 82:15)
you're expecting me to fall faster than (82:13 - 82:17)
i am and it affects my shields (82:15 - 82:19)
it affects when i hit things and heal (82:17 - 82:22)
back like (82:19 - 82:22)
it makes a huge difference over the (82:23 - 82:27)
course of a game (82:26 - 82:29)
and the faster you can level them up the (82:27 - 82:31)
bigger advantage you're going to have (82:29 - 82:31)
and that (82:31 - 82:34)
is just a fact it is a pay-to-win game (82:31 - 82:37)
like a lot of other moba games are (82:34 - 82:40)
well but with the caveat that you can (82:37 - 82:41)
throw (82:40 - 82:42)
a million dollars into this game if (82:41 - 82:44)
you're not good (82:42 - 82:47)
at actually manipulating (82:44 - 82:49)
the characters on the screen or (82:47 - 82:50)
understanding this track i mean there (82:49 - 82:51)
are (82:50 - 82:54)
i honestly before putting money into it (82:51 - 82:55)
if you are starting to (82:54 - 82:58)
really enjoy this game you've got to (82:55 - 83:00)
learn what the difference between rotom (82:58 - 83:01)
and dreadna are (83:00 - 83:03)
yeah and who goes for rotom and who goes (83:01 - 83:04)
for dreadnought because that is (83:03 - 83:06)
very meaningful and that's not about the (83:04 - 83:08)
money that you put into the game (83:06 - 83:11)
like you're like i i agree that (83:08 - 83:14)
on some level (83:11 - 83:14)
money isn't going to overcome poor skill (83:15 - 83:18)
level (83:18 - 83:21)
like it's gonna help but if you are just (83:18 - 83:24)
bad or you make bad choices or you don't (83:21 - 83:25)
know how to (83:24 - 83:27)
or where to go like throwing money at (83:25 - 83:29)
the game isn't gonna fix (83:27 - 83:33)
you not knowing how to play the game but (83:29 - 83:35)
you're gonna you're gonna learn how to (83:33 - 83:36)
play the game or you're gonna find (83:35 - 83:37)
people that (83:36 - 83:39)
that teach you how to play the game like (83:37 - 83:40)
there are already a lot of good guides (83:39 - 83:41)
like (83:40 - 83:42)
yep you should be here you should be (83:41 - 83:44)
here this is what this is this is who (83:42 - 83:45)
these are the people you're supposed to (83:44 - 83:47)
support and you can take in that (83:45 - 83:48)
knowledge (83:47 - 83:52)
uh but paying to win (83:48 - 83:54)
are paying to increase these items is (83:52 - 83:55)
going to give you (83:54 - 83:58)
more time to get that skill it buys you (83:55 - 84:00)
a little extra oomph (83:58 - 84:02)
to help refine what you're doing well (84:00 - 84:03)
but also (84:02 - 84:06)
fundamentally if if you and i have (84:03 - 84:08)
equivalent skill levels (84:06 - 84:11)
in the game but i have bought the items (84:08 - 84:11)
and (84:11 - 84:14)
upgraded the items i will win yeah i (84:11 - 84:15)
will beat you (84:14 - 84:18)
yeah yes yes yep now i i was told (84:15 - 84:21)
again i'm i'm i'm just parodying things (84:18 - 84:23)
that i was told by people who played a (84:21 - 84:24)
lot of league of legends (84:23 - 84:27)
um that this did exist in league it was (84:24 - 84:28)
called runes (84:27 - 84:30)
correct and you could equip runes and (84:28 - 84:32)
you could pay to upgrade the runes but (84:30 - 84:34)
league has gotten rid of that system (84:32 - 84:35)
yeah also (84:34 - 84:37)
you can just equip a rune and that's (84:35 - 84:38)
fine uh (84:37 - 84:40)
who knows if matt if unite will go down (84:38 - 84:44)
that route right now (84:40 - 84:47)
whether or not you like it it is a thing (84:44 - 84:49)
that exists in the game (84:47 - 84:52)
uh there there's a couple so (84:49 - 84:56)
so i i i stress that that that our slash (84:52 - 84:57)
nintendo (84:56 - 85:01)
thing was slightly incorrect (84:57 - 85:02)
i mean they did say the game is pay to (85:01 - 85:05)
win that's true but they didn't explain (85:02 - 85:07)
how to do it they pointed out two items (85:05 - 85:09)
well they pointed out the i the (85:07 - 85:11)
the held items and they pointed out the (85:09 - 85:13)
what is the purple thing called (85:11 - 85:16)
it's called um the item enhancer yeah (85:13 - 85:17)
those are two things you can't actually (85:16 - 85:18)
pay money for (85:17 - 85:20)
right so the big question is like how do (85:18 - 85:21)
you get that so the (85:20 - 85:23)
the way around it the actual pay to win (85:21 - 85:25)
which is like really kind of backwards (85:23 - 85:26)
because i feel like if they just wanted (85:25 - 85:28)
to make money they would just let you (85:26 - 85:29)
buy these two with coins i don't know (85:28 - 85:30)
why (85:29 - 85:32)
they didn't order gems sorry i don't (85:30 - 85:33)
know why they just didn't (85:32 - 85:34)
put a gem button next to it because they (85:33 - 85:36)
would have made money (85:34 - 85:38)
um maybe they just didn't want it to be (85:36 - 85:39)
so transparent i think they don't want (85:38 - 85:41)
to be so transparent i think (85:39 - 85:45)
i think the importance of (85:41 - 85:45)
an easy barrier of entry and those (85:46 - 85:50)
things are hidden (85:48 - 85:52)
helps to keep the game from seeing like (85:50 - 85:54)
suffering from (85:52 - 85:57)
moba toxicity right like it doesn't let (85:54 - 85:59)
people who are very familiar with mobas (85:57 - 85:59)
to be like (85:59 - 86:02)
oh immediately this is a toxic game this (85:59 - 86:02)
is a bad (86:02 - 86:05)
pay to win situation um and i think it (86:02 - 86:06)
also gets hidden (86:05 - 86:09)
so that (86:06 - 86:12)
the majority of casual players don't (86:09 - 86:14)
interact with it (86:12 - 86:16)
and don't sort of understand what it is (86:14 - 86:18)
or how to do it and so it sort of (86:16 - 86:21)
starts to separate out the player base (86:18 - 86:23)
to some extent to like people who don't (86:21 - 86:24)
understand it (86:23 - 86:26)
can all have a very casual still fun (86:24 - 86:28)
experience (86:26 - 86:29)
and in ranked battles they're going to (86:28 - 86:31)
start separating themselves out (86:29 - 86:34)
and it makes a weird (86:31 - 86:36)
dual system in the game that i'm not (86:34 - 86:39)
overly fond of but i kind of (86:36 - 86:41)
get their reasoning behind it a little (86:39 - 86:42)
bit very clash royale (86:41 - 86:46)
yeah it is um so so how you (86:42 - 86:48)
pay to win at this point in the game or (86:46 - 86:49)
there's two ways (86:48 - 86:52)
you either use spend 200 (86:49 - 86:56)
gems on the (86:52 - 86:59)
um gotcha mechanic yep so that (86:56 - 87:01)
adds energy back into the gotcha (86:59 - 87:02)
mechanic (87:01 - 87:05)
and when you earn this is a weird (87:02 - 87:06)
mechanic (87:05 - 87:08)
we we haven't even explained this the (87:06 - 87:11)
the worst thing that this game does (87:08 - 87:14)
is there's like 17 menus yeah and they (87:11 - 87:15)
all don't make sense (87:14 - 87:17)
they're all like where where do i go to (87:15 - 87:19)
equipped an item what is this gotcha (87:17 - 87:21)
mechanic what of the three different (87:19 - 87:23)
stores do i have to go to to purchase (87:21 - 87:23)
something (87:23 - 87:25)
what currency am i using out of the six (87:23 - 87:27)
currencies you have (87:25 - 87:30)
even worse the the actual biggest (87:27 - 87:33)
crime that this game has committed (87:30 - 87:36)
is the x menu which is your prime menu (87:33 - 87:37)
for (87:36 - 87:39)
going through and doing stuff you go x (87:37 - 87:41)
to open the menu (87:39 - 87:43)
you select what you want to go into you (87:41 - 87:45)
go into it (87:43 - 87:48)
every human on this planet (87:45 - 87:52)
has the expectation and right (87:48 - 87:55)
i dare to say right to hit b to get (87:52 - 87:58)
back to the x menu that i started from (87:55 - 87:58)
not b (87:58 - 88:00)
to exit it all completely so i have to (87:58 - 88:02)
start from the beginning again (88:00 - 88:05)
shave on you timmy shame playing the (88:02 - 88:07)
game (88:05 - 88:09)
doesn't enrage me as much as that x and (88:07 - 88:10)
b combo (88:09 - 88:12)
because i get so mad when it kicks me (88:10 - 88:15)
out dead and (88:12 - 88:15)
improvement here's a true story i was on (88:20 - 88:24)
wednesday it was upstairs i was playing (88:22 - 88:24)
unite (88:24 - 88:28)
i did that exact combo (88:24 - 88:32)
and i swore very loudly and (88:28 - 88:35)
suddenly my husband is running upstairs (88:32 - 88:37)
going what's wrong (88:35 - 88:40)
did you fall did something fall over and (88:37 - 88:41)
i had to look at him and go (88:40 - 88:44)
it's just this stupid game i got very (88:41 - 88:45)
very mad (88:44 - 88:48)
poor ui okay so there (88:45 - 88:51)
there is a gotcha mechanic in the game (88:48 - 88:52)
we talked about this earlier this is the (88:51 - 88:53)
way to get the talonflame (88:52 - 88:57)
skin it does the game for some of its (88:53 - 88:58)
faults we've talked about the game is (88:57 - 89:01)
transparent in that's gotcha mechanic it (88:58 - 89:02)
is a (89:01 - 89:05)
half a percent a one in 200 chance of (89:02 - 89:06)
getting (89:05 - 89:09)
the talonflame thing out of the gotcha (89:06 - 89:10)
machine (89:09 - 89:12)
but when you complete a match you get (89:10 - 89:14)
like 20 to 30 (89:12 - 89:17)
uh energy and every time you get to 100 (89:14 - 89:18)
energy you can (89:17 - 89:20)
crank the gotcha machine and it pops out (89:18 - 89:21)
a very (89:20 - 89:24)
bland shirt or like coins or something i (89:21 - 89:26)
got a pair of socks (89:24 - 89:30)
better than you pokemon go yeah every (89:26 - 89:32)
every week you get a thousand energy so (89:30 - 89:34)
you get 10 loot boxes a day you can (89:32 - 89:36)
spend 200 gems which is what like four (89:34 - 89:37)
bucks (89:36 - 89:39)
and you can add another thousand to it (89:37 - 89:40)
you can also spend (89:39 - 89:44)
um gems to earn (89:40 - 89:47)
more energy per (89:44 - 89:49)
week or whatever like you can earn the (89:47 - 89:51)
energy faster (89:49 - 89:55)
uh so the pay to win comes in through (89:51 - 89:58)
two options the gotcha machine so (89:55 - 89:59)
putting money into the gacha machine to (89:58 - 90:00)
get the (89:59 - 90:03)
item enhancers or to get tickets to buy (90:00 - 90:05)
item enhancers (90:03 - 90:08)
or by leveling up your battle pass by (90:05 - 90:10)
paying to level up your battle pass and (90:08 - 90:12)
that's not new every right every (90:10 - 90:14)
little literally every game clash royale (90:12 - 90:17)
fortnite call of duty apex (90:14 - 90:18)
they all have an option where you can (90:17 - 90:21)
buy levels in a level battle pass (90:18 - 90:22)
but because you cannot buy these item (90:21 - 90:24)
enhancers outright (90:22 - 90:26)
you either have to pay to upgrade your (90:24 - 90:28)
battle pass or you just pay for the (90:26 - 90:29)
gacha machine (90:28 - 90:31)
and that is where the pay to win comes (90:29 - 90:33)
in so they do obscure it in a way (90:31 - 90:36)
um but but it like like like there's no (90:33 - 90:38)
if anyone's trying to like say like it's (90:36 - 90:40)
not pay to win i don't know what (90:38 - 90:42)
kool-aid they're drinking (90:40 - 90:44)
it is and that's like look it's fine it (90:42 - 90:45)
doesn't matter if somebody's paid a (90:44 - 90:47)
hundred dollars or somebody's paid zero (90:45 - 90:48)
dollars i will still lose it's (90:47 - 90:50)
it's okay it's fine i actually kind of (90:48 - 90:51)
feel better if the you know 100 (90:50 - 90:53)
person beats me because you know they (90:51 - 90:54)
spent money and i didn't that's fine (90:53 - 90:56)
it's okay (90:54 - 90:59)
i i think inherently look (90:56 - 91:02)
if you don't ever want to play a game (90:59 - 91:04)
that has a pay to win advantage (91:02 - 91:07)
i respect that i played greg and i both (91:04 - 91:09)
played clash royale for (91:07 - 91:12)
three years every day (91:09 - 91:15)
it was it was paid it was pay to win day (91:12 - 91:15)
one (91:15 - 91:19)
yeah it was but i still won (91:15 - 91:22)
a majority of my matches i still had a (91:19 - 91:23)
great time (91:22 - 91:24)
i think i ended up putting maybe in the (91:23 - 91:26)
three years of that game i put in like (91:24 - 91:28)
25 (91:26 - 91:31)
to 30 dollars uh five of it went to a (91:28 - 91:32)
charity thing which i'm like (91:31 - 91:35)
still very happy with and it was fine (91:32 - 91:36)
like (91:35 - 91:39)
i i it's so hard like i get it i get (91:36 - 91:40)
being like this game is pay to win i'm (91:39 - 91:41)
staying away from it (91:40 - 91:46)
but also like you're going to lose (91:41 - 91:48)
yeah whether it's pay to win or not like (91:46 - 91:50)
i you're just going to lose and for me (91:48 - 91:52)
i've just never been like in clash (91:50 - 91:54)
royale when i was like level 8 and you (91:52 - 91:57)
dropped in front of like a level 11 (91:54 - 92:00)
and all their units were maxed out and (91:57 - 92:01)
like you you recognize that right away (92:00 - 92:03)
you go like oh that dude spent (92:01 - 92:05)
like probably 500 bucks to be where he (92:03 - 92:06)
is (92:05 - 92:08)
like i'm not mad that he's going to win (92:06 - 92:09)
it's just like whatever (92:08 - 92:11)
you won cool like yeah the matches are (92:09 - 92:13)
so fast i'm just gonna get into another (92:11 - 92:16)
match and move on like it's totally cool (92:13 - 92:18)
yeah i had a brief heartburn over the (92:16 - 92:20)
rank system when like (92:18 - 92:22)
i lost and it dropped me down a pip and (92:20 - 92:25)
i'm like excuse me i heard that (92:22 - 92:29)
how dare you yeah but then i sort of (92:25 - 92:33)
re-centered and i'm like i (92:29 - 92:36)
i need to focus on less about the rank (92:33 - 92:39)
and more about am i having fun and sort (92:36 - 92:41)
of accepting the fact that i am going to (92:39 - 92:42)
lose (92:41 - 92:45)
every i'm going to lose a number of (92:42 - 92:46)
times (92:45 - 92:49)
and what keeps (92:46 - 92:52)
that from being not (92:49 - 92:55)
a horrible experience is the matches are (92:52 - 92:57)
capped at 10 minutes so i'm like i'm (92:55 - 92:58)
just gonna jump into another one and (92:57 - 93:00)
have a good time (92:58 - 93:05)
and b i don't have an active voice chat (93:00 - 93:10)
screaming toxicity at me (93:05 - 93:12)
i feel like there's this like perception (93:10 - 93:15)
of like (93:12 - 93:15)
gosh i don't even know how to explain it (93:16 - 93:21)
like people are people (93:18 - 93:24)
think that oh the game is pay to win so (93:21 - 93:26)
i lost because they paid money (93:24 - 93:28)
right which which in reality is like i (93:26 - 93:30)
feel like you're just (93:28 - 93:32)
trying to like coat that you lost and (93:30 - 93:34)
just accept that you lose like (93:32 - 93:36)
i mean like it's it's what i said (93:34 - 93:38)
earlier at the beginning of the podcast (93:36 - 93:42)
i can tell in a game that i am the weak (93:38 - 93:42)
link (93:42 - 93:45)
like like it is so self-reflective of (93:42 - 93:45)
like (93:45 - 93:48)
this is why we're losing it's because of (93:45 - 93:50)
me and i think a lot of people just (93:48 - 93:50)
don't want (93:50 - 93:52)
to accept that and don't want to point (93:50 - 93:53)
it out so the first thing they jump to (93:52 - 93:56)
is oh that dude spent more money (93:53 - 93:58)
yeah like i know you just you it's okay (93:56 - 94:00)
you're just bad at the game or you just (93:58 - 94:00)
had (94:00 - 94:03)
or like you just had a bad game it's (94:00 - 94:04)
like yeah (94:03 - 94:06)
like some like i i have dropped in apex (94:04 - 94:09)
legends and i have died right away (94:06 - 94:12)
and it's like am i bad no i just i just (94:09 - 94:13)
dropped in a bad spot (94:12 - 94:15)
that that person just picked up a gun (94:13 - 94:17)
before me uh i i (94:15 - 94:20)
my cat jumped on my lap i have also (94:17 - 94:21)
dropped in apex legends and i've won (94:20 - 94:22)
like three games in a row (94:21 - 94:26)
yeah with with pickup groups like (94:22 - 94:28)
it's whatever it's like you don't get (94:26 - 94:29)
the highs (94:28 - 94:32)
of winning without the lows of losing (94:29 - 94:32)
right (94:32 - 94:36)
it's it's it's like the rng you can (94:32 - 94:39)
get better at things um and i guess the (94:36 - 94:40)
way to circumvent that (94:39 - 94:43)
is just always play with friends yeah (94:40 - 94:45)
that definitely helps (94:43 - 94:48)
but if if you have to just kind of like (94:45 - 94:50)
look the pay to win is bad i'm not (94:48 - 94:50)
defending it (94:50 - 94:53)
it's like it like it's and i dealt with (94:50 - 94:55)
it in clash royale and it was (94:53 - 94:58)
i would say that my clash royale (94:55 - 95:00)
experience was good because i played it (94:58 - 95:00)
for three (95:00 - 95:02)
years if it was bad i would have quit (95:00 - 95:04)
earlier um (95:02 - 95:07)
but the game genuinely was fun yep and (95:04 - 95:08)
it was doing a lot of things that i (95:07 - 95:09)
really liked that no other game was (95:08 - 95:10)
doing (95:09 - 95:14)
and i and there's not a fiber right now (95:10 - 95:15)
in this podcast recording where i (95:14 - 95:17)
i cannot say that pokemon unite is not (95:15 - 95:19)
fun it is incredibly fun (95:17 - 95:22)
it is it is it is a game (95:19 - 95:26)
mechanic or a type of game that (95:22 - 95:30)
i want in my life right now and (95:26 - 95:32)
i will lose matches because i am playing (95:30 - 95:33)
with random people (95:32 - 95:36)
and some people on my team might be good (95:33 - 95:38)
and some people on my team might be bad (95:36 - 95:40)
but that is the same for the other team (95:38 - 95:42)
they might have really good players and (95:40 - 95:42)
really (95:42 - 95:45)
bad players i might have an afk player (95:42 - 95:47)
they might have an afk player (95:45 - 95:49)
i might have a whale on my team who (95:47 - 95:50)
spent a lot of money (95:49 - 95:52)
they might have a whale like there's so (95:50 - 95:54)
many variables going (95:52 - 95:56)
in that i feel like if you're going to (95:54 - 95:57)
just push off the game and be like it's (95:56 - 95:58)
pay to win i'm not playing it that's (95:57 - 95:59)
fine (95:58 - 96:02)
but also i don't think that's your (95:59 - 96:03)
problem right (96:02 - 96:04)
right i think your problem is you're (96:03 - 96:06)
afraid to lose over and over and i get (96:04 - 96:09)
it losing success yeah losing stinks (96:06 - 96:11)
no no no no no you can tell when also (96:09 - 96:13)
when people are coordinated like they're (96:11 - 96:15)
in a chat together because (96:13 - 96:16)
oh yeah they're like oh they're all (96:15 - 96:18)
talking to each other because (96:16 - 96:20)
these things are happening way too fast (96:18 - 96:22)
or you roll up and everyone has very (96:20 - 96:24)
similar names (96:22 - 96:24)
i'm about to get wrecked it's hard in a (96:27 - 96:32)
com it's hard to (96:29 - 96:32)
suppress like the competitive nature (96:35 - 96:38)
that we have in ourselves and (96:36 - 96:40)
if you get super frustrated at losing (96:38 - 96:42)
over and over and over again (96:40 - 96:45)
like it's it's easy to be like (96:42 - 96:47)
i just played an hour i lost every match (96:45 - 96:49)
that i was in (96:47 - 96:52)
uh and that is a disheartening (96:49 - 96:55)
feel but i i think but i also don't (96:52 - 96:56)
think you just dropping a bunch of money (96:55 - 96:57)
is going to fix that (96:56 - 97:00)
no truth but also a person dropping (96:57 - 97:01)
about some money (97:00 - 97:02)
didn't necessarily make that different (97:01 - 97:05)
like you sort of have to figure out what (97:02 - 97:07)
about the game makes you (97:05 - 97:11)
happy and play the game and be like (97:07 - 97:14)
i still find enjoyment of this i don't (97:11 - 97:15)
think (97:14 - 97:18)
pay to i don't think paying (97:15 - 97:21)
somebody paying automatically negates (97:18 - 97:22)
that formula (97:21 - 97:25)
right like there are ways around the pay (97:22 - 97:27)
to win thing like i'm gonna play with my (97:25 - 97:28)
group of friends we're only gonna do (97:27 - 97:30)
friendly matches (97:28 - 97:31)
we're only gonna i'm only gonna do quick (97:30 - 97:34)
matches i'm only going to do (97:31 - 97:36)
the weird three three match that you can (97:34 - 97:38)
like there are uh there are ways to (97:36 - 97:39)
interact with the game where that (97:38 - 97:40)
doesn't become (97:39 - 97:42)
a huge factor i think i think you made a (97:40 - 97:43)
super good point greg (97:42 - 97:46)
like you have to find what brings the (97:43 - 97:48)
enjoyment out of you (97:46 - 97:50)
and i i think i saw that and and i knew (97:48 - 97:52)
this was going to happen (97:50 - 97:53)
like i stream on twitch people always (97:52 - 97:55)
want a backseat (97:53 - 97:56)
like this happens all the time like when (97:55 - 97:58)
i do competitive vgc or one (97:56 - 98:00)
especially if you're ever playing the (97:58 - 98:01)
pokemon trading card game online people (98:00 - 98:02)
are like why'd you play that card why (98:01 - 98:04)
don't you do this why don't you do (98:02 - 98:06)
like like i had somebody go like why are (98:04 - 98:08)
you using that hell dad i'm on cramer (98:06 - 98:08)
ant (98:08 - 98:11)
because i'm using the silly claw the a (98:08 - 98:12)
palm (98:11 - 98:14)
claw thing which lets you um it lets you (98:12 - 98:16)
do more damage to (98:14 - 98:20)
bots oh oh yeah isn't that a fluffy tail (98:16 - 98:20)
one (98:20 - 98:22)
fluffy tail yeah yeah and they were like (98:20 - 98:24)
oh you should be running eject button on (98:22 - 98:24)
cram (98:24 - 98:26)
and it's like or they'll be like why are (98:24 - 98:28)
you running hurricane and not air slash (98:26 - 98:32)
and it's like because i legit have (98:28 - 98:34)
fun with these this moveset and this (98:32 - 98:35)
item (98:34 - 98:39)
yeah so i i am i am sure that air slash (98:35 - 98:40)
or dive is a better combination than (98:39 - 98:41)
surfing (98:40 - 98:46)
and uh hurricane i am sure that this (98:41 - 98:48)
float stone shouldn't be on crameran and (98:46 - 98:49)
shel bell should be (98:48 - 98:53)
um like but the way i set up my cramer (98:49 - 98:53)
ant (98:53 - 98:57)
i love it yup and it is fun for me (98:53 - 98:59)
and it has gotten me to where i am in it (98:57 - 99:01)
and i'm cool with that (98:59 - 99:04)
and yep once i get bored with that or (99:01 - 99:05)
once i feel like (99:04 - 99:08)
i am confident and i want to venture out (99:05 - 99:09)
i will make that move (99:08 - 99:11)
but i think it's really important for (99:09 - 99:12)
people to (99:11 - 99:14)
play something you are super comfortable (99:12 - 99:15)
with and if if somebody wants to give (99:14 - 99:16)
you feedback like if somebody go (99:15 - 99:18)
if i'm like you know i hit my i hit my (99:16 - 99:20)
ceiling with cramer (99:18 - 99:22)
i'm not sure what else i can do and if (99:20 - 99:23)
that choice is removing (99:22 - 99:26)
floatstone and putting on (99:23 - 99:29)
assault vests i'll do that when i get (99:26 - 99:30)
there (99:29 - 99:34)
but like right now i like where i'm at (99:30 - 99:36)
and i'm having fun and i think that's (99:34 - 99:37)
super important is like (99:36 - 99:39)
if you have a different mindset where (99:37 - 99:40)
like you want to come into this game (99:39 - 99:42)
you want to drop some money you want to (99:40 - 99:44)
be the very best i (99:42 - 99:48)
props props to you i'm genuinely having (99:44 - 99:49)
a good time just playing (99:48 - 99:51)
i don't get i i can't say i don't get (99:49 - 99:53)
salty when i lose it is incredibly (99:51 - 99:54)
frustrating (99:53 - 99:56)
when you have a teammate that like wants (99:54 - 99:58)
to give up in the first like two minutes (99:56 - 99:59)
of the match (99:58 - 100:00)
it is frustrating when you have a (99:59 - 100:03)
teammate literally refuse to leave camp (100:00 - 100:04)
and do they just they've just accepted (100:03 - 100:05)
the game as (100:04 - 100:07)
over uh it also feels good when that (100:05 - 100:08)
teammate (100:07 - 100:10)
literally sat and camped for eight (100:08 - 100:12)
minutes and you still win the match (100:10 - 100:14)
yeah that felt great yeah and it also (100:12 - 100:15)
felt great on the winning screen when (100:14 - 100:17)
everyone thumbs up each other but that (100:15 - 100:18)
one dude (100:17 - 100:19)
that didn't do anything and then i (100:18 - 100:21)
reported him for being inactive because (100:19 - 100:22)
he was (100:21 - 100:23)
oh i didn't even know you could thumbs (100:22 - 100:25)
up people yeah you can good job people (100:23 - 100:27)
here's the thing here's the thing here's (100:25 - 100:31)
my life advice for this podcast (100:27 - 100:33)
advice isn't advice unless the person (100:31 - 100:37)
asks for it if you're just giving (100:33 - 100:40)
advice and the person never asked for it (100:37 - 100:42)
you're just spouting your opinion at a (100:40 - 100:44)
person who's like (100:42 - 100:47)
go away yeah advice only becomes advice (100:44 - 100:49)
if somebody says hey can you give me (100:47 - 100:50)
advice on what i'm doing (100:49 - 100:52)
here because they're only then are they (100:50 - 100:54)
receptive to hearing what you have to (100:52 - 100:55)
offer (100:54 - 100:57)
right like if i if i say to my twitch (100:55 - 100:58)
chat (100:57 - 101:00)
i don't know what i did bad in that (100:58 - 101:02)
match like i like look like i (101:00 - 101:04)
i was i was last in the match i kept (101:02 - 101:06)
getting killed by this gengar (101:04 - 101:08)
i don't know how not to get killed by (101:06 - 101:09)
the gengar i don't know should i go (101:08 - 101:10)
somewhere else like (101:09 - 101:12)
and and no one has an answer right and (101:10 - 101:13)
right that's fine because everyone's new (101:12 - 101:14)
at the game (101:13 - 101:15)
like there was one point i was playing (101:14 - 101:17)
guard chomp and like right before (101:15 - 101:19)
i never played guard chomp it was just (101:17 - 101:20)
like the team needed an all-rounder i (101:19 - 101:21)
was like i'll take one for the team i'll (101:20 - 101:23)
search a guard chump i played them like (101:21 - 101:24)
twice (101:23 - 101:25)
and then like i pan i panicked and i (101:24 - 101:27)
added my three best items it was like (101:25 - 101:28)
shell bell (101:27 - 101:29)
it was literally what i planned cram and (101:28 - 101:31)
then somebody in chat was like (101:29 - 101:33)
i don't think shel bell should be on (101:31 - 101:34)
garchomp after i like died (101:33 - 101:38)
and i would thank you yeah i'm gonna go (101:34 - 101:39)
out on a whim and say (101:38 - 101:41)
shell bell is not the reason why i'm (101:39 - 101:43)
losing right now i'm exactly (101:41 - 101:45)
very confident like my held items in the (101:43 - 101:46)
situation (101:45 - 101:48)
do not matter this team has been like (101:46 - 101:49)
stopping the whole (101:48 - 101:52)
like me and everyone else like it's fine (101:49 - 101:53)
like it was (101:52 - 101:56)
clear that our team had no synergy i'm (101:53 - 101:58)
not very good at garchomp (101:56 - 102:00)
they had some sort of coordination (101:58 - 102:01)
whether it was voice chat or not and (102:00 - 102:02)
they (102:01 - 102:03)
they they destroyed us like it wasn't (102:02 - 102:06)
even close um and that's fine like that (102:03 - 102:06)
happens (102:06 - 102:09)
same thing in any other game you can (102:06 - 102:11)
drop in apex legends and (102:09 - 102:13)
just get wiped right away it's not the (102:11 - 102:15)
end of the world it's nice that uh (102:13 - 102:16)
unite matches are only like 10 minutes (102:15 - 102:18)
long and then 10 minutes goes by super (102:16 - 102:20)
fast (102:18 - 102:22)
like longer than the three minutes of (102:20 - 102:24)
clash royale so like it is a bit of a (102:22 - 102:26)
time sync but (102:24 - 102:29)
it can feel long it can definitely feel (102:26 - 102:32)
long when your team (102:29 - 102:35)
gives up like three minutes in uh but if (102:32 - 102:37)
if your team is genuinely trying and it (102:35 - 102:39)
feels like an even fight that 10 minutes (102:37 - 102:40)
goes by yeah (102:39 - 102:41)
i'm so happy i've never had that (102:40 - 102:43)
experience our (102:41 - 102:45)
final battle last night where we were (102:43 - 102:46)
like (102:45 - 102:50)
we were struggling back and forth and (102:46 - 102:52)
we lost but only by a small mark yeah i (102:50 - 102:54)
think we only lost by like 50 points (102:52 - 102:58)
and like it was (102:54 - 103:00)
it was still a lot of fun like i still (102:58 - 103:02)
had a great time we lost (103:00 - 103:05)
and it was a it was not a close game for (103:02 - 103:06)
a (103:05 - 103:07)
for the whole start of the match and (103:06 - 103:09)
then we really cranked it at (103:07 - 103:12)
at the end and we still lost but i felt (103:09 - 103:13)
like (103:12 - 103:15)
everybody got together we did a lot of (103:13 - 103:17)
great things i made some mistakes i know (103:15 - 103:18)
i did i did (103:17 - 103:21)
dumb things whatever um (103:18 - 103:23)
and it's still fun like i think i'm like (103:21 - 103:24)
that was a still a good (103:23 - 103:27)
game there is one thing i wish (103:24 - 103:30)
i could turn off it's the announcer (103:27 - 103:31)
saying (103:30 - 103:35)
you lose at the end yeah i know you do (103:31 - 103:38)
not have to yell this at me (103:35 - 103:38)
this is not a function that needs to be (103:38 - 103:42)
in this game i am aware (103:40 - 103:45)
that i lost i do not need an announcer (103:42 - 103:47)
screaming from my tv (103:45 - 103:49)
that i lost let me turn that off or just (103:47 - 103:51)
get rid of it nobody needs it we know we (103:49 - 103:55)
lost i mean just turn the volume off (103:51 - 103:55)
i mean i try but then it gets really (103:55 - 103:58)
weird (103:58 - 104:01)
so my my key point in all of this that i (103:58 - 104:02)
want to get across (104:01 - 104:05)
is the the reminder that we must (104:02 - 104:07)
frequently make to people (104:05 - 104:09)
like people who play tcgs people who (104:07 - 104:10)
play mobas (104:09 - 104:11)
people who play anything that's player (104:10 - 104:13)
first player (104:11 - 104:17)
games are for fun if you're not having (104:13 - 104:18)
fun (104:17 - 104:20)
and just playing it is making you angry (104:18 - 104:21)
angry (104:20 - 104:25)
angry stop (104:21 - 104:28)
all right because you're gonna go into (104:25 - 104:31)
an anger pit the game's not gonna be fun (104:28 - 104:32)
for you it's just gonna become an (104:31 - 104:32)
obsession (104:32 - 104:35)
yep and you just need to walk away if (104:32 - 104:36)
you can't (104:35 - 104:38)
lose and laugh then you you're playing (104:36 - 104:40)
the wrong game (104:38 - 104:41)
there was a there was a point very early (104:40 - 104:43)
on in clash royale where i (104:41 - 104:46)
was not having fun and i think i stepped (104:43 - 104:47)
away for (104:46 - 104:49)
for two weeks and i think they did some (104:47 - 104:51)
sort of update to the game (104:49 - 104:52)
they did a lot of updates to clash (104:51 - 104:54)
royale a lot of updates but (104:52 - 104:57)
but they genuinely made the game better (104:54 - 104:59)
every time (104:57 - 105:00)
and made it more accessible and made (104:59 - 105:02)
made it more and like they balance (105:00 - 105:03)
characters and stuff (105:02 - 105:06)
and like right now oh we didn't even (105:03 - 105:09)
talk about this like right now (105:06 - 105:11)
it it is definitely frustrating to play (105:09 - 105:13)
against zera aura (105:11 - 105:16)
um i and i would probably maybe say (105:13 - 105:16)
gengar (105:16 - 105:17)
maybe because i don't understand how (105:16 - 105:20)
gengar works yeah i figured out zero's (105:17 - 105:21)
deal (105:20 - 105:23)
like i can usually now usually go (105:21 - 105:24)
toe-to-toe with zero (105:23 - 105:27)
like i i play i also played zero or well (105:24 - 105:29)
so i know what like (105:27 - 105:32)
they do i do not get gengar (105:29 - 105:35)
gengar wrecks me every time i'm like oh (105:32 - 105:35)
no like (105:35 - 105:37)
like no one's going on social media (105:35 - 105:39)
being like mr mime is overpowered or (105:37 - 105:40)
kramer ants overpowered or (105:39 - 105:42)
or like i can't figure out alolan (105:40 - 105:44)
ninetales or anything like that it is it (105:42 - 105:44)
is like (105:44 - 105:48)
primarily zera aura and gengar that (105:44 - 105:51)
have a lot of frustration around and (105:48 - 105:53)
zero or kind of makes sense because like (105:51 - 105:55)
it wasn't in the canadian beta it wasn't (105:53 - 105:57)
in any of the chinese betas (105:55 - 106:00)
it was like specifically just added and (105:57 - 106:01)
i am sure (106:00 - 106:05)
that like other games (106:01 - 106:07)
these characters will be tweaked i don't (106:05 - 106:08)
know if we have to wait till the end of (106:07 - 106:09)
the season for that i don't know if we (106:08 - 106:10)
have to wait a month i don't know if we (106:09 - 106:12)
have to wait two weeks (106:10 - 106:15)
but it does feel like specifically xeror (106:12 - 106:17)
and gengar are just a pain to play (106:15 - 106:18)
against (106:17 - 106:19)
um they're it's not impossible though (106:18 - 106:22)
like like i feel like xerora is on every (106:19 - 106:23)
enemy team i play (106:22 - 106:26)
and like i think i have like a 65 win (106:23 - 106:26)
ratio (106:26 - 106:28)
or something so it's like not impossible (106:26 - 106:31)
i think the (106:28 - 106:31)
i think the case that zero or zero is (106:31 - 106:35)
overpowered (106:34 - 106:37)
is (106:35 - 106:37)
faulty i don't think xero aura is (106:38 - 106:42)
overpowered (106:41 - 106:44)
i think it came out of nowhere i think (106:42 - 106:45)
nobody knew (106:44 - 106:48)
what zera aura did it has a very (106:45 - 106:51)
unique play style and i think people (106:48 - 106:52)
capitalized it (106:51 - 106:55)
on it very early on i (106:52 - 106:58)
don't see zera or a dominance like i did (106:55 - 106:59)
the first day (106:58 - 107:04)
i i i don't think i think it took people (106:59 - 107:07)
time to understand what the attacks are (107:04 - 107:07)
like (107:07 - 107:11)
discharge is going to do this if it hits (107:07 - 107:11)
you and (107:11 - 107:14)
it has a stun effect and that it can (107:11 - 107:15)
combine these things up so (107:14 - 107:17)
like you're learning how to compensate (107:15 - 107:19)
for it i think gengar being a locked (107:17 - 107:20)
character (107:19 - 107:23)
has a similar problem like i i don't run (107:20 - 107:25)
into it often enough and i don't know (107:23 - 107:25)
what it does (107:25 - 107:27)
i don't know what to expect from it but (107:25 - 107:29)
like zero or i expect the minute it (107:27 - 107:31)
shows up it's gonna spark at me it's (107:29 - 107:32)
gonna jump (107:31 - 107:34)
right to my thing so i need to eject to (107:32 - 107:35)
away from where it thinks it's going to (107:34 - 107:37)
be the thing with getting (107:35 - 107:39)
is it poisons you and then hex does a (107:37 - 107:40)
ton of damage (107:39 - 107:42)
yeah there is technically an option in (107:40 - 107:43)
the game which is full heal you could (107:42 - 107:45)
full heal yourself in poison and (107:43 - 107:46)
theoretically gengar shouldn't be able (107:45 - 107:48)
to like one shot you (107:46 - 107:50)
but no one's running full heal like (107:48 - 107:52)
everyone is just running eject button (107:50 - 107:55)
right um and (107:52 - 107:57)
like it's literally like the fourth day (107:55 - 107:58)
of the game and everyone just (107:57 - 108:00)
default and it doesn't help that like (107:58 - 108:01)
youtubers are like eject button is the (108:00 - 108:03)
best button and the best item and it's (108:01 - 108:06)
like yeah it's it's good but also what (108:03 - 108:07)
am i doing against gengar (108:06 - 108:08)
besides getting poisoned and then (108:07 - 108:09)
instantly dying maybe i should run full (108:08 - 108:10)
heal i don't know (108:09 - 108:12)
eject button makes sense for me i need (108:10 - 108:14)
to get out to heal people (108:12 - 108:17)
i need to jump like as elder goss i need (108:14 - 108:19)
that extra movement i need to be able to (108:17 - 108:21)
get to a place where i can heal and (108:19 - 108:21)
survive (108:21 - 108:25)
like i need the boost other people don't (108:21 - 108:25)
need the boost (108:25 - 108:28)
like understand what your character is (108:25 - 108:29)
supposed to be doing (108:28 - 108:32)
helps decide that button the reason (108:29 - 108:33)
doesn't work for everybody (108:32 - 108:35)
the reason i don't run inject button on (108:33 - 108:37)
cram is because i still can't get away (108:35 - 108:38)
from things fast enough (108:37 - 108:40)
even with eject button like like i think (108:38 - 108:42)
pikachu has a little bit too much range (108:40 - 108:45)
because even eject button away from (108:42 - 108:46)
pikachu i still lose that (108:45 - 108:49)
running away like it's whatever electro (108:46 - 108:51)
ball just follows and hones in (108:49 - 108:53)
so well i still like with eject button i (108:51 - 108:54)
still cannot speed gengar i still cannot (108:53 - 108:57)
speed up so i still can't out speed um (108:54 - 108:58)
talon well talonflame is not a problem (108:57 - 109:00)
no one's playing talonflame it's fine i (108:58 - 109:01)
mean some people are (109:00 - 109:03)
yeah there are some good talent players (109:01 - 109:05)
out there but like eject button allows (109:03 - 109:06)
me (109:05 - 109:09)
breathing space to get another heal in (109:06 - 109:09)
and (109:09 - 109:13)
if i can get if i can get the gap for a (109:09 - 109:15)
second and get another heal off i can (109:13 - 109:17)
win that fight (109:15 - 109:19)
i can kite you back to where you're (109:17 - 109:20)
slowed down and then i can (109:19 - 109:23)
really with net fight uh but i don't i i (109:20 - 109:24)
think everyone's like oh just use a (109:23 - 109:26)
check button because it lets you get (109:24 - 109:27)
away like (109:26 - 109:30)
no like that's great for ranged (109:27 - 109:31)
attackers that is not great for other (109:30 - 109:33)
things that's not great for snorlax who (109:31 - 109:35)
needs to stay up there (109:33 - 109:37)
and and wreck house snorlax needs a (109:35 - 109:38)
different item (109:37 - 109:42)
um but again it's early people are still (109:38 - 109:42)
trying to figure (109:42 - 109:46)
a lot of things out um like what's (109:42 - 109:49)
ideal uh i've had people say what are (109:46 - 109:50)
you doing running xp (109:49 - 109:52)
share like you don't get to auto level (109:50 - 109:54)
and i'm like for a million reasons i use (109:52 - 109:55)
xp share like (109:54 - 109:57)
there are other benefits that i get from (109:55 - 110:00)
it yeah it's it's like a very kind it's (109:57 - 110:02)
like a very meta thing of like (110:00 - 110:05)
like i like i've seen i've seen uh i've (110:02 - 110:07)
seen lists where people put venusaur at (110:05 - 110:08)
the bottom (110:07 - 110:10)
yep and like venus venusaur's the worst (110:08 - 110:11)
character don't play venusaur and i was (110:10 - 110:13)
literally in a game where (110:11 - 110:16)
venusaur destroyed everyone yes and i (110:13 - 110:17)
was like i don't know (110:16 - 110:19)
like and i knew i like i knew playing in (110:17 - 110:20)
the game like (110:19 - 110:22)
whoever venusaur is i don't know what (110:20 - 110:24)
you're doing at the two minute mark (110:22 - 110:25)
you're rocking it four minute mark holy (110:24 - 110:28)
cow what are you doing you're so good (110:25 - 110:31)
six minute mark i can just stop playing (110:28 - 110:32)
whoever's playing venusaur they're just (110:31 - 110:34)
winning and like (110:32 - 110:36)
and then the the end results came in and (110:34 - 110:37)
it was like yes (110:36 - 110:40)
venusaur literally dominated the entire (110:37 - 110:41)
match and this is like (110:40 - 110:43)
a character that most people wrote off (110:41 - 110:44)
like right away in four days where like (110:43 - 110:45)
no (110:44 - 110:46)
don't play venusaur he's the worst (110:45 - 110:49)
character and it's like (110:46 - 110:52)
like there's so much that like people (110:49 - 110:54)
play in different styles and people like (110:52 - 110:55)
different things and people (110:54 - 110:56)
have like i don't know maybe if that (110:55 - 110:58)
venus or player moved to a zero or a (110:56 - 111:00)
player they would have got (110:58 - 111:01)
they would have done even better who (111:00 - 111:04)
knows but like the (111:01 - 111:08)
i get why there's a toxicity to (111:04 - 111:11)
mobas or maybe other games (111:08 - 111:12)
of like why aren't you doing this why (111:11 - 111:13)
aren't you using this move why aren't (111:12 - 111:15)
you using this holodom why are you going (111:13 - 111:16)
like (111:15 - 111:19)
calm down calm down like like it was (111:16 - 111:21)
always frustrating for me to play (111:19 - 111:24)
vgc because i work with a coach i work (111:21 - 111:25)
with somebody who won a world (111:24 - 111:26)
championship (111:25 - 111:28)
so people would come into my stream and (111:26 - 111:30)
they would be like why aren't you (111:28 - 111:31)
running light screen on grimsnar (111:30 - 111:33)
why are you only running reflect and not (111:31 - 111:35)
light screen and then they're giving me (111:33 - 111:36)
all these like points about my team as (111:35 - 111:38)
i'm playing which is like fine whatever (111:36 - 111:41)
like i get it all the time but it's like (111:38 - 111:43)
and like like i know it's like really (111:41 - 111:45)
pretentious to say but it's it's like (111:43 - 111:48)
well how many world championships have (111:45 - 111:49)
you won (111:48 - 111:52)
because literally a world champion (111:49 - 111:55)
helped build my team and we practiced it (111:52 - 111:57)
and we went through and there's a reason (111:55 - 111:58)
why we're only running reflect on (111:57 - 111:59)
grimstar and we're not running light (111:58 - 112:00)
screen (111:59 - 112:04)
and like i don't know where (112:00 - 112:05)
i don't know where people come from but (112:04 - 112:07)
they're like why aren't you doing this (112:05 - 112:08)
and it's (112:07 - 112:10)
like i i feel like maybe there's a good (112:08 - 112:12)
intention of like i'm trying to help you (112:10 - 112:13)
out there he is (112:12 - 112:17)
but it's like but see point a advice (112:13 - 112:19)
that's not asked for is just your (112:17 - 112:21)
opinion (112:19 - 112:25)
uh so yeah it's it's it's frustrating (112:21 - 112:28)
people i i people have the best (112:25 - 112:30)
intentions right they want you to do (112:28 - 112:33)
better but how they express their best (112:30 - 112:34)
intentions (112:33 - 112:38)
is sometimes very toxic (112:34 - 112:38)
overall i think united is great (112:39 - 112:44)
i don't think it's perfect i don't think (112:42 - 112:45)
anyone (112:44 - 112:47)
thought that this game was gonna be (112:45 - 112:48)
released and be like this perfect (112:47 - 112:51)
amazing game (112:48 - 112:52)
i think if they keep adding new clothes (112:51 - 112:54)
they keep adding new characters (112:52 - 112:57)
i think if they balance stuff (112:54 - 113:00)
i think that would be great to increase (112:57 - 113:02)
the life of the game (113:00 - 113:04)
um i am sure there will be a in like two (113:02 - 113:06)
weeks pokemon unite is dead (113:04 - 113:10)
even though i'm sure that we'll be still (113:06 - 113:11)
making a lot of money and it will still (113:10 - 113:12)
be really (113:11 - 113:13)
healthy it's just the you know the (113:12 - 113:15)
players who wanted to play it for a week (113:13 - 113:17)
fell off and that's fine (113:15 - 113:19)
um oh i'm sorry one more thing before we (113:17 - 113:20)
we (113:19 - 113:23)
move on i just want to talk about zapdos (113:20 - 113:24)
as a mechanic (113:23 - 113:27)
um zapdos is like the golden snitch (113:24 - 113:30)
of pokemon unite if you've ever watched (113:27 - 113:31)
harry potter (113:30 - 113:34)
most games are won when the person (113:31 - 113:35)
catches the snitch because it's worth so (113:34 - 113:36)
many points (113:35 - 113:39)
uh zapdos is that mechanic it always (113:36 - 113:41)
appears in the center at the eight (113:39 - 113:41)
minute mark (113:41 - 113:44)
it is very frustrating when your team (113:41 - 113:46)
wants to concede before zapdos (113:44 - 113:48)
at the eight minute mark yeah it appears (113:46 - 113:49)
that eight minutes (113:48 - 113:52)
eight minutes in two minutes left (113:49 - 113:54)
two minutes left eight minutes and two (113:52 - 113:55)
minutes left um (113:54 - 113:57)
it's very frustrating when your team is (113:55 - 113:59)
losing and your your (113:57 - 114:02)
your team wants to concede and if i was (113:59 - 114:03)
on voice chat (114:02 - 114:04)
i guarantee you it wouldn't change the (114:03 - 114:06)
conversation because i would be yelling (114:04 - 114:08)
we can still win with zapdos and they (114:06 - 114:10)
would probably be like well i don't care (114:08 - 114:11)
we already lost game over (114:10 - 114:16)
conceived conceit but the amount like (114:11 - 114:16)
i think out of the 60 games i've played (114:16 - 114:21)
zaptos has always won me the game with (114:21 - 114:26)
the exception of two games (114:23 - 114:28)
and and to be fair not every game zapdos (114:26 - 114:30)
was taken like there are (114:28 - 114:31)
they're probably like 10 out of 60 games (114:30 - 114:33)
where no one got zapdos (114:31 - 114:36)
they just ignored it but you can be (114:33 - 114:37)
losing (114:36 - 114:39)
and i know some people have said like (114:37 - 114:40)
they need to change zapdos it's too (114:39 - 114:41)
powerful (114:40 - 114:45)
it's or it changes the game too much (114:41 - 114:48)
but i don't but if you're (114:45 - 114:50)
losing for eight minutes like it is (114:48 - 114:53)
literally the way you can win (114:50 - 114:56)
it's not a guaranteed win but (114:53 - 114:58)
if you change zapdos to the point where (114:56 - 115:01)
like it doesn't matter as much (114:58 - 115:03)
then there's not that weird comeback (115:01 - 115:05)
thing (115:03 - 115:09)
and like if you're winning (115:05 - 115:11)
zapdos is just as important and if (115:09 - 115:13)
you're losing (115:11 - 115:16)
zapdos is everything so i don't know how (115:13 - 115:17)
they fit i (115:16 - 115:20)
i like it i like the snitch mentality of (115:17 - 115:21)
zapdos (115:20 - 115:23)
i think it's weird that you know we're (115:21 - 115:25)
four days in and like if you're losing (115:23 - 115:27)
and your team still doesn't go to zapdos (115:25 - 115:28)
i don't know what's going through their (115:27 - 115:30)
mind i don't know how they (115:28 - 115:32)
think they're going to win if we're at (115:30 - 115:33)
eight minutes and they're not ignoring (115:32 - 115:35)
zapdos like it is the win condition if (115:33 - 115:36)
you're losing (115:35 - 115:39)
um and it is the thing you should still (115:36 - 115:41)
go after if you're winning like i feel (115:39 - 115:41)
like (115:41 - 115:43)
at least to me it feels balanced in the (115:41 - 115:46)
sense of like this is an important match (115:43 - 115:47)
this is an important point of the match (115:46 - 115:50)
for both players still (115:47 - 115:53)
um and it's not a guaranteed win like i (115:50 - 115:54)
said like i've gotten (115:53 - 115:56)
we've gotten zapdos twice and we still (115:54 - 115:58)
lost (115:56 - 116:02)
out of 60 matches but i don't know i (115:58 - 116:03)
don't know how you guys feel about it (116:02 - 116:04)
well i think what people are (116:03 - 116:06)
misunderstanding is (116:04 - 116:09)
they want the game to be only one thing (116:06 - 116:10)
i (116:09 - 116:13)
gather energy i score points on goals (116:10 - 116:16)
and what they're actually doing or timmy (116:13 - 116:18)
tencent is doing is saying (116:16 - 116:20)
eight minutes into the game the game (116:18 - 116:22)
changes (116:20 - 116:24)
it becomes either prevent your opponents (116:22 - 116:26)
from getting zapdos (116:24 - 116:29)
or do everything you can to get zapdos (116:26 - 116:29)
right (116:29 - 116:32)
so that is it's it's a catch-up mechanic (116:29 - 116:34)
there are a ton of catch-up mechanics in (116:32 - 116:36)
this game (116:34 - 116:37)
right because the more you score on your (116:36 - 116:39)
opponent's goal guess what you have (116:37 - 116:41)
fewer goals to get to and it's harder to (116:39 - 116:42)
get to them (116:41 - 116:45)
they they do tons of things but it's (116:42 - 116:46)
like (116:45 - 116:47)
the players who are complaining about (116:46 - 116:49)
zapdos only want to do (116:47 - 116:51)
one thing and they don't want the game (116:49 - 116:53)
to convert (116:51 - 116:56)
at any point during the game and i i've (116:53 - 116:58)
seen other pokemon in the middle (116:56 - 117:01)
so well on like um on like the three (116:58 - 117:02)
verse three map (117:01 - 117:04)
uh they put avalon in the middle yeah (117:02 - 117:06)
and then in like the 4v4 i think they (117:04 - 117:07)
put reggie giggs in the middle (117:06 - 117:10)
yep or sorry i think i flipped those i (117:07 - 117:11)
think reggie goes three first three (117:10 - 117:12)
avalon is four (117:11 - 117:15)
no reggie gigas is the (117:12 - 117:15)
yeah ready gage is the three avalog is (117:16 - 117:19)
the four (117:18 - 117:21)
because avalon's on the snob map and (117:19 - 117:24)
there's one more (117:21 - 117:26)
because there's another map but i i (117:24 - 117:27)
would still argue that (117:26 - 117:30)
the same people who don't understand (117:27 - 117:32)
that the game has to shift once the (117:30 - 117:33)
zapdos appears (117:32 - 117:34)
are the people who completely ignore (117:33 - 117:37)
rotom and completely ignore dreadnaught (117:34 - 117:39)
because they don't understand that those (117:37 - 117:42)
are actually mechanics that you need (117:39 - 117:46)
to or even further ignore ludicolo (117:42 - 117:49)
and ignore bouffalon which are buffs (117:46 - 117:50)
that you (117:49 - 117:53)
somebody should be grabbing yeah the (117:50 - 117:54)
speedster in the middle needs to be (117:53 - 117:56)
grabbing those so that you get buffs (117:54 - 117:56)
like (117:56 - 118:00)
the they're important parts they aren't (117:56 - 118:00)
they aren't necessarily game breaking i (118:01 - 118:05)
like last night the other team (118:03 - 118:08)
got the zapdos and we still held them (118:05 - 118:10)
off long enough to make it an incredibly (118:08 - 118:10)
close game (118:10 - 118:13)
like zapdos is a win condition it is not (118:10 - 118:14)
a for (118:13 - 118:17)
sure condition exactly um (118:14 - 118:20)
but it it is one of the few (118:17 - 118:23)
catch-up mechanics um it won't overcome (118:20 - 118:24)
certain things like if a person is just (118:23 - 118:25)
sitting (118:24 - 118:28)
at base and you're a 4b5 (118:25 - 118:31)
uh it is still going to be hard winning (118:28 - 118:34)
zapdos to get to those goals to score (118:31 - 118:36)
because you still have to get to them (118:34 - 118:38)
and you still have to get the energy (118:36 - 118:40)
into the goal and sometimes (118:38 - 118:42)
that's not possible if somebody has (118:40 - 118:44)
given up (118:42 - 118:45)
but it was one of the few catch-up (118:44 - 118:48)
mechanics that is still very important (118:45 - 118:50)
what's really happening is basically (118:48 - 118:52)
like you've been in a basketball game (118:50 - 118:53)
for eight minutes (118:52 - 118:55)
and then for the last two minutes it's a (118:53 - 118:57)
boxing match or what is it like uh what (118:55 - 118:58)
is it in wrestling when all the (118:57 - 119:00)
wrestlers get in the ring together (118:58 - 119:01)
free-for-all (119:00 - 119:03)
yeah pray for alzheimer's battle royale (119:01 - 119:05)
it's like but but (119:03 - 119:07)
that's the game yeah that's the game (119:05 - 119:09)
that they designed and gave to you (119:07 - 119:11)
you can complain because you only see it (119:09 - 119:13)
from one perspective but try to open (119:11 - 119:15)
your mind to understand (119:13 - 119:18)
that they does the design of the game (119:15 - 119:20)
is basketball for eight minutes two (119:18 - 119:22)
minutes of free-for-all (119:20 - 119:25)
and i don't i don't know like there have (119:22 - 119:26)
been so many games (119:25 - 119:28)
and i think the three games we played (119:26 - 119:29)
greg we (119:28 - 119:32)
we lo we were losing the first eight (119:29 - 119:33)
minutes (119:32 - 119:36)
and it was because like (119:33 - 119:38)
like i feel like if you remove the (119:36 - 119:40)
zapdos mechanic or you make it (119:38 - 119:42)
weaker where it doesn't square as many (119:40 - 119:43)
points (119:42 - 119:45)
i feel like that just makes the first (119:43 - 119:47)
eight minutes more of like (119:45 - 119:50)
well we should just give up right (119:47 - 119:51)
because like even (119:50 - 119:52)
there has been so many games where it's (119:51 - 119:54)
like okay we're losing but we can still (119:52 - 119:55)
win this we're losing but we can still (119:54 - 119:56)
win this we're losing but we can still (119:55 - 119:58)
win this (119:56 - 120:01)
and then we get zapdos and we win this (119:58 - 120:03)
and the games where we're losing we're (120:01 - 120:04)
losing (120:03 - 120:06)
we're losing we need to go to zapdos oh (120:04 - 120:07)
we didn't get zapdos yeah of course we (120:06 - 120:08)
lost because like (120:07 - 120:10)
yeah how like there was no like that is (120:08 - 120:11)
the way we win is (120:10 - 120:14)
zapdos um and there's been games where (120:11 - 120:15)
we've been winning (120:14 - 120:17)
we've been winning we've been winning (120:15 - 120:19)
they got zapdos (120:17 - 120:22)
oh they just won like we why didn't (120:19 - 120:23)
anyone go to protect zapdos why did we (120:22 - 120:25)
ignore it like (120:23 - 120:27)
will is right the game changes at eight (120:25 - 120:28)
minutes and it's an (120:27 - 120:30)
important end of the game and i i think (120:28 - 120:32)
reality like thematically it's exciting (120:30 - 120:33)
too (120:32 - 120:36)
like you are taking you are separating (120:33 - 120:38)
the team of five (120:36 - 120:41)
into three areas for eight minutes (120:38 - 120:43)
and then at the last two minutes those (120:41 - 120:44)
teams have to come together (120:43 - 120:49)
and have synergy i don't (120:44 - 120:50)
i don't think it's terribly broken i (120:49 - 120:52)
just think the game changes and (120:50 - 120:54)
people haven't figured out how to adapt (120:52 - 120:55)
to that yet yeah i will say (120:54 - 120:59)
like i've gotten the habit if somebody (120:55 - 121:03)
says oh i'm voting to surrender (120:59 - 121:04)
i've been going along with it because (121:03 - 121:05)
that person has just given up and (121:04 - 121:08)
stopped playing it at that point (121:05 - 121:11)
fine like i i don't want to give in (121:08 - 121:12)
because like (121:11 - 121:14)
like dude like i feel like that person (121:12 - 121:16)
saying we're surrendering at four (121:14 - 121:17)
minutes (121:16 - 121:19)
have they never one with have they do (121:17 - 121:20)
they know that zapdos appears at eight (121:19 - 121:21)
minutes (121:20 - 121:23)
do they even know there's an end game (121:21 - 121:25)
like have they never (121:23 - 121:28)
won by getting zapdos and feeling like (121:25 - 121:29)
oh we can still win this (121:28 - 121:33)
like what is what i don't know i don't (121:29 - 121:35)
get it (121:33 - 121:37)
i i have a feeling people like i'm just (121:35 - 121:39)
not the slots i want to get in the next (121:37 - 121:41)
game with whatever reason like (121:39 - 121:43)
it is often it is often a healthy person (121:41 - 121:44)
and (121:43 - 121:48)
quite frankly like i have i have voted (121:44 - 121:49)
to stay (121:48 - 121:51)
and have one but more often when that (121:49 - 121:53)
happens and i voted to stay (121:51 - 121:57)
they have refused to play and (121:53 - 121:59)
and then you then you yeah you give (121:57 - 122:00)
everyone else a thumbs up and you rep (121:59 - 122:02)
and you yeah you report that person for (122:00 - 122:04)
idling and they get they get a mark and (122:02 - 122:05)
they (122:04 - 122:07)
i don't know become a better player like (122:05 - 122:08)
i feel like the people that have the (122:07 - 122:09)
mindset of like (122:08 - 122:10)
i'm just gonna throw in the towel this (122:09 - 122:13)
is a loss like i get it like if you lost (122:10 - 122:14)
that zapdos (122:13 - 122:15)
you've been losing the whole game you (122:14 - 122:17)
lost that zapdos there's a minute left (122:15 - 122:19)
sure i guess concede right (122:17 - 122:22)
like save yourself a minute of time but (122:19 - 122:24)
if you have the mindset of like i'm not (122:22 - 122:25)
even going to try to play out the zapdos (122:24 - 122:27)
part and i'm just going to give up now (122:25 - 122:29)
like i feel like your mindset is you're (122:27 - 122:31)
always going to be in great league or (122:29 - 122:32)
you're always going to be in expert (122:31 - 122:34)
league like you're never going to push (122:32 - 122:36)
forward because you're not challenging (122:34 - 122:38)
yourself to come back from situations (122:36 - 122:40)
yeah i mean i agree that it's important (122:38 - 122:41)
but like i (122:40 - 122:44)
i've had a lot of bad experiences of (122:41 - 122:45)
people who (122:44 - 122:48)
just give up and i didn't sort of uh (122:45 - 122:48)
like (122:48 - 122:52)
the report uh (122:48 - 122:52)
the report function isn't obvious like (122:53 - 122:56)
it took me (122:55 - 122:58)
a bit to find it to be like oh this is (122:56 - 123:00)
what we do (122:58 - 123:04)
um i wonder how it works though like (123:00 - 123:06)
because it took me like three days to (123:04 - 123:08)
realize there's a thumbs up button (123:06 - 123:11)
yeah and i i learned the report button (123:08 - 123:12)
in the first day (123:11 - 123:14)
because like you would play like in the (123:12 - 123:15)
first five matches i think we had (123:14 - 123:17)
somebody like just idle and bass (123:15 - 123:20)
um and if you so at the end screen where (123:17 - 123:22)
it shows everyone's score (123:20 - 123:24)
you can like tab over and you can go up (123:22 - 123:26)
to the name and you can hit x (123:24 - 123:27)
and you can hit block so you never play (123:26 - 123:29)
with that person again but you can also (123:27 - 123:29)
hit (123:29 - 123:31)
it'll say report and there's two things (123:29 - 123:33)
you can report for you can report for (123:31 - 123:35)
idling and then you can report for (123:33 - 123:38)
i think like harassment but the (123:35 - 123:40)
harassment doesn't exist yet (123:38 - 123:42)
technically because there while there is (123:40 - 123:43)
a the reason we brought up voice chat (123:42 - 123:45)
earlier is because there is a button for (123:43 - 123:46)
in-game voice chat (123:45 - 123:47)
it's just not they just don't have it on (123:46 - 123:49)
like it just doesn't exist yet (123:47 - 123:50)
i think it might exist through the (123:49 - 123:53)
nintendo app (123:50 - 123:55)
probably but there's no like in-game (123:53 - 123:56)
voice chat (123:55 - 123:58)
in unite as i i'm i think most people (123:56 - 124:00)
probably are with friends in the food (123:58 - 124:02)
discord and that's fine (124:00 - 124:04)
um but yeah you can do harassment or you (124:02 - 124:05)
can do like (124:04 - 124:07)
not playing slash idling and when you (124:05 - 124:08)
hit the not playing (124:07 - 124:11)
idling it says it will give them a 10 (124:08 - 124:12)
point (124:11 - 124:16)
deduction on their account (124:12 - 124:16)
but i like obviously that's not manually (124:16 - 124:20)
looked by (124:19 - 124:22)
at a human it's just taking your word (124:20 - 124:23)
for it (124:22 - 124:28)
uh i've seen them get reversed yep (124:23 - 124:30)
like like somebody lost points and then (124:28 - 124:31)
they get a follow-up message that says (124:30 - 124:33)
we actually restored your points (124:31 - 124:36)
oh really yeah interesting i wonder (124:33 - 124:38)
like i wonder if somebody got reported (124:36 - 124:40)
for idling but then they also got like (124:38 - 124:41)
thumbs up for a good job i wonder if (124:40 - 124:43)
that cancels it out (124:41 - 124:45)
but i didn't realize the thumbs up was a (124:43 - 124:48)
like it's it's like a button right below (124:45 - 124:50)
i think report it'll say like good job (124:48 - 124:52)
but you should like ideally you should (124:50 - 124:54)
be good jobbing (124:52 - 124:57)
like players that are like like it does (124:54 - 124:59)
feel good to get a good job (124:57 - 125:02)
and monster hunter does this and final (124:59 - 125:05)
fantasy does this (125:02 - 125:08)
where at the end instead of just (125:05 - 125:09)
complaining about people (125:08 - 125:12)
you can be like hey even though we lost (125:09 - 125:12)
because (125:12 - 125:15)
ethan over here sat in the base for (125:12 - 125:16)
eight minutes (125:15 - 125:20)
uh that lucario dude was awesome (125:16 - 125:23)
give him a good job (125:20 - 125:23)
like reinforce good behavior yeah yeah (125:24 - 125:28)
yeah yep (125:27 - 125:30)
i agree (125:28 - 125:30)
all right sorry no question of the week (125:31 - 125:34)
we ran long (125:33 - 125:37)
i didn't even prepare a song because i (125:34 - 125:41)
knew this would be like a 17-hour show (125:37 - 125:43)
a whale what is our pokemon of the week (125:41 - 125:44)
all right let's do it quick last week's (125:43 - 125:46)
pokemon think of recent events this (125:44 - 125:48)
week's pokemon has less to do with (125:46 - 125:50)
dragons than it has to do with the woman (125:48 - 125:52)
who lent her family name to the sonic (125:50 - 125:54)
youth side project that produced the (125:52 - 125:58)
whitey album on april 5th 1988. (125:54 - 126:02)
so easy (125:58 - 126:07)
[Music] (126:02 - 126:07)

character in unite i don't it doesn't (126:17 - 126:20)
exist (126:19 - 126:23)
so the entire previous weekend when i (126:20 - 126:24)

40 hours with you people was nothing (126:24 - 126:28)
jeez (126:27 - 126:31)

our friendship (126:31 - 126:35)
not towards pokemon of the week what (126:32 - 126:40)

four shiny scyther no (126:52 - 126:59)
adino you got meluetta (126:55 - 127:01)
melowetta is based on madonna because (126:59 - 127:04)
she sings and she dances (127:01 - 127:06)
i don't know i feel like i feel like (127:04 - 127:08)
that's britney spears i feel like that's (127:06 - 127:10)
christina aguilera i feel like that's (127:08 - 127:14)
could be shakira definitely shakira (127:10 - 127:17)
oh definitely shakira you heard it here (127:14 - 127:19)
first mellowed up based on shakira (127:17 - 127:22)
now hips don't lie none of these are (127:19 - 127:23)
from new york (127:22 - 127:27)
madonna came from the club scene of new (127:23 - 127:27)
york (127:27 - 127:30)
drew which is unova is based on new york (127:27 - 127:33)
i also referenced dragons (127:30 - 127:36)
which would be zechariah but also (127:33 - 127:38)
recent events being that this was the (127:36 - 127:41)
day after go fest ended (127:38 - 127:43)
which should have been and if you looked (127:41 - 127:45)
up (127:43 - 127:47)
sonic youth's album the whitey album (127:45 - 127:48)
that came out (127:47 - 127:52)
april 5th 1988 they (127:48 - 127:54)
called themselves the chicona youth (127:52 - 127:56)
which is madonna's last (127:54 - 127:59)
name which is (127:56 - 128:02)
chinchino (127:59 - 128:02)
good effort but there were no chinchinos (128:02 - 128:06)
in pokemon go fest (128:05 - 128:10)
not dude uh also (128:06 - 128:12)
what was the other thing it has two (128:10 - 128:14)
forms (128:12 - 128:18)
it sings and dances just like shakira (128:14 - 128:20)
what was that madonna movie (128:18 - 128:21)
dagnabbit now that just came i i just (128:20 - 128:24)
listened to a whole review of it (128:21 - 128:26)
truth or dare if you watch truth or dare (128:24 - 128:27)
you will see madonna (128:26 - 128:30)
sing and or dance it took me like eight (128:27 - 128:31)
years (128:30 - 128:33)
to realize that melody has like a (128:31 - 128:34)
headset on (128:33 - 128:37)
yes what it was like very not obvious at (128:34 - 128:38)
first (128:37 - 128:40)
if you watch zootopia you will see that (128:38 - 128:42)
shakira can sing (128:40 - 128:45)
and dance but shakira is from colombia (128:42 - 128:46)
she is not from (128:45 - 128:50)
new york i think she's from columbia (128:46 - 128:53)
you don't know it's from new york now (128:50 - 128:58)
hips don't lie oh gracious me here we go (128:53 - 129:00)
what do you got to say about mellowetta (128:58 - 129:02)
anything uh it is the lightest fighting (129:00 - 129:03)
type pokemon (129:02 - 129:06)
it was leaked on the poster of kirim vs (129:03 - 129:07)
the swords of justice (129:06 - 129:09)
during the black two white two is it (129:07 - 129:10)
even in that movie (129:09 - 129:13)
how is it lighter than mark shadow who (129:10 - 129:14)
is literally a shadow (129:13 - 129:18)
i don't know the pure the pureet farm is (129:14 - 129:19)
the lightest (129:18 - 129:23)
pirouette pirouette it says (129:19 - 129:26)
that melowetta is the only mythical not (129:23 - 129:27)
to have a starring role in the movie (129:26 - 129:29)
excluding fiona if it is considered one (129:27 - 129:30)
yes bulpita is (129:29 - 129:32)
it is considered one get get stop being (129:30 - 129:33)
a boomer get with the times we already (129:32 - 129:35)
moved past that fione is a mythical (129:33 - 129:36)
pokemon (129:35 - 129:40)
um melowetta is always programmed to (129:36 - 129:41)
have a star piece when encountered in (129:40 - 129:43)
the wild in black and white however (129:41 - 129:45)
mellowetta cannot be found in the wild (129:43 - 129:46)
in those games (129:45 - 129:49)
there's some trivia ah marshada weighs (129:46 - 129:50)
almost 50 pounds (129:49 - 129:54)
i know how it's a shadow it's a habit (129:50 - 129:57)
don't judge but (129:54 - 129:59)
does your shadow weigh 50 pounds to be (129:57 - 130:01)
fair marshado has like a weird coat on (129:59 - 130:05)
like a hoodie true very the thick hoodie (130:01 - 130:09)
the shuffle icon is outstanding (130:05 - 130:13)
both both shuffle icons fyi (130:09 - 130:16)
where are these uh yeah they're pretty (130:13 - 130:17)
good (130:16 - 130:19)
the eyes are a little weird look your (130:17 - 130:20)
eyes are a little weird (130:19 - 130:22)
uh the shiny is good as well stop being (130:20 - 130:23)
so toxic greg (130:22 - 130:26)
i know well if you get into the bottom (130:23 - 130:27)
lane to do your job the unite (130:26 - 130:30)
is already rubbing off (130:27 - 130:30)
i love how greg called it the bottom row (130:31 - 130:34)
okay (130:33 - 130:37)
this week's pokemon yesterday evening i (130:34 - 130:39)
had the delightful opportunity to enjoy (130:37 - 130:41)
an evening meal with the pokemon (130:39 - 130:43)
luminaries greg leatherman (130:41 - 130:46)
and nicholas burgess unfortunately (130:43 - 130:48)
villainy was afoot (130:46 - 130:50)
it was has become clear to me that at (130:48 - 130:51)
some point (130:50 - 130:53)
during the meal possibly when i stepped (130:51 - 130:55)
away to the toire (130:53 - 130:57)
as we were at a japanese restaurant (130:55 - 130:59)
someone tampered with my food (130:57 - 131:02)
and or drink i have become ill almost (130:59 - 131:03)
upon to death today (131:02 - 131:06)
i was clearly being targeted for someone (131:03 - 131:07)
else's choices (131:06 - 131:10)
as i had chosen an innocent tonkatsu (131:07 - 131:12)
donburi for my dinner (131:10 - 131:15)
as far as i know greg and his husband (131:12 - 131:17)
only ate chicken and vegetable dishes (131:15 - 131:19)
so the blame clearly falls upon nicholas (131:17 - 131:22)
burgess and his spouse as assigned (131:19 - 131:24)
i believe they shared a plate of odd (131:22 - 131:25)
delicacies (131:24 - 131:27)
which most likely included the item that (131:25 - 131:30)
caused our table to be targeted (131:27 - 131:32)
while i frequently avoid restaurants (131:30 - 131:34)
that serve pokemon in whole or in part (131:32 - 131:35)
dishes (131:34 - 131:37)
greg is the one who selected yesterday's (131:35 - 131:38)
place (131:37 - 131:40)
there are some pokemon-based foods that (131:38 - 131:42)
can be enjoyed without fainting the (131:40 - 131:43)
pokemon (131:42 - 131:45)
but i still object to the process of (131:43 - 131:47)
harming the pokemon (131:45 - 131:49)
i suspect one of the most notable types (131:47 - 131:50)
of these dishes (131:49 - 131:52)
featuring the tale of a not very (131:50 - 131:53)
intelligent pokemon (131:52 - 131:56)
was featured on the burgess's appetizer (131:53 - 131:57)
plate (131:56 - 132:00)
this particular pokemon features a split (131:57 - 132:01)
evolutionary line (132:00 - 132:02)
one with more intelligence than the (132:01 - 132:05)
other which is further bifurcated based (132:02 - 132:07)
upon which version of the pokemon it (132:05 - 132:10)
started from and what evolution item was (132:07 - 132:11)
used to evolve it (132:10 - 132:13)
only one of this pokemon's final (132:11 - 132:15)
evolutions has features that contribute (132:13 - 132:16)
towards his potential career as a (132:15 - 132:18)
nefarious assassin (132:16 - 132:20)
besides a black cape draped over its (132:18 - 132:22)
shoulders it is the only evolution that (132:20 - 132:25)
features a mask pulled over its face (132:22 - 132:28)
it also has easy access to poison the (132:25 - 132:29)
poison that has brought me to the edge (132:28 - 132:31)
of my grave today (132:29 - 132:33)
without a trainer this pokemon can only (132:31 - 132:34)
learn one poison type (132:33 - 132:37)
move its evolutionary sibling can learn (132:34 - 132:38)
too (132:37 - 132:40)
and i do feel that i have both taken (132:38 - 132:44)
damage and had my defense lowered (132:40 - 132:50)
that zigzagoon he wears a mask yeah (132:44 - 132:50)
like nick the reason there's a rock (132:50 - 132:56)
fossil event in masters is because there (132:54 - 132:58)
is a rock fossil event in go right now (132:56 - 133:01)
and there was a rock fossil event in (132:58 - 133:05)
sword and shield this weekend (133:01 - 133:07)
i think you can chalk it up to dialga (133:05 - 133:09)
going back in time to find these fossils (133:07 - 133:12)
as the alga is the reward but (133:09 - 133:15)
also there is a fossil exhibit happening (133:12 - 133:17)
in japan right now which is probably (133:15 - 133:18)
actually the reason why these events are (133:17 - 133:20)
happening that's so bad (133:18 - 133:24)
um but this is just the uh synergy (133:20 - 133:26)
that we say between the games that (133:24 - 133:27)
they've been doing a very good job at (133:26 - 133:30)
last the last like 12 months in doing (133:27 - 133:31)
there is an eevee community day next (133:30 - 133:33)
month and ironically enough (133:31 - 133:36)
evie here are evolving skies the next (133:33 - 133:39)
set which is very eevee focused is also (133:36 - 133:41)
coming out next month (133:39 - 133:43)
i'm going to chalk that up to synergy as (133:41 - 133:44)
well in my opinion (133:43 - 133:46)
i feel like that's not like they could (133:44 - 133:47)
redo (133:46 - 133:49)
eevee community day at any point but (133:47 - 133:51)
they're deciding to do it the month that (133:49 - 133:54)
a huge evtcg set is going out in america (133:51 - 133:56)
no incorrect (133:54 - 133:58)
i need to get all the eeveelutions in (133:56 - 134:00)
order to get to the next level in (133:58 - 134:02)
pokemon go like level 42 or (134:00 - 134:04)
oh they're doing it because will and i (134:02 - 134:06)
just turned over they got the news i (134:04 - 134:08)
turned over so they finally scheduled (134:06 - 134:10)
that community day (134:08 - 134:12)
makes sense there's been a fly in this (134:10 - 134:13)
room this entire (134:12 - 134:17)
podcast i'm losing my mind sure there is (134:13 - 134:18)
what else what is the fly telling you (134:17 - 134:21)
right now steve i'm a (134:18 - 134:23)
guy gonna bring like three cats in here (134:21 - 134:25)
to take care of this (134:23 - 134:27)
uh (134:25 - 134:27)

i have i don't know the characters the (135:46 - 135:50)
only i only know one character (135:48 - 135:54)
and that's yasuo so i'm a yasuo i mean (135:50 - 135:55)
now (135:54 - 135:58)
you don't you're not toxic enough i'm (135:55 - 136:00)

please (136:11 - 136:15)
thank you for all the yasuo mains out (136:12 - 136:16)
there for why (136:15 - 136:18)
you need to understand that what yasuo (136:16 - 136:20)
you're you're a toxic person (136:18 - 136:22)
it's because yasuo's key phrase that he (136:20 - 136:24)
yells out in the game is hazaki (136:22 - 136:27)
and then i know all of the yasuo mains (136:24 - 136:28)
out there (136:27 - 136:30)
convert that phrase at every chance they (136:28 - 136:32)
have to use it and yell it out so (136:30 - 136:33)
like if somebody has to go to the (136:32 - 136:35)
bathroom they yell out hossapi (136:33 - 136:39)
et cetera that's the and i'm tired of it (136:35 - 136:41)
that is the secret word for today's if (136:39 - 136:42)
i'm walking to the front door of your (136:41 - 136:45)
