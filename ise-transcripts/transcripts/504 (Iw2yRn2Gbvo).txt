spending time while you're battling in (2:46 - 2:51)
an online battle competition with me (2:48 - 2:53)
trying to figure out what my team's (2:51 - 2:58)
strategy is you have already lost (2:53 - 2:58)
you know 45 seconds is not enough time i (2:59 - 3:04)
i could tell the opponent was literally (3:02 - 3:05)
trying to think (3:04 - 3:08)
what is the strategy here (3:05 - 3:10)
as opposed to just (3:08 - 3:11)
mashing (3:10 - 3:15)
draco meteor and wiping out my team (3:11 - 3:17)
um (3:15 - 3:19)
we could talk about that uh we have like (3:17 - 3:23)
two big things that have like a lot of (3:19 - 3:26)
news one is tcg stuff there's pokemon go (3:23 - 3:27)
stuff so (3:26 - 3:29)
um (3:27 - 3:31)
i guess we'll go through that (3:29 - 3:35)
and we'll see where that takes us (3:31 - 3:38)
can we start here (3:35 - 3:42)
sword and shield astral radiance was (3:38 - 3:43)
announced (3:42 - 3:46)
uh which is set to release on may 27th (3:43 - 3:49)
it will feature 180 cards (3:46 - 3:52)
and it says travel back to the primitive (3:49 - 3:54)
land dominated by myth and legend where (3:52 - 3:58)
origin form dialga v star in origin form (3:54 - 4:01)
palkia v star that's so fun to say sh (3:58 - 4:04)
will shape the very fabric of time and (4:01 - 4:07)
space explore a vast wilderness unlike (4:04 - 4:08)
anything you've ever experienced where (4:07 - 4:11)
you will encounter disease typhlosion (4:08 - 4:14)
and samurai as hesuyan pokemon v star (4:11 - 4:16)
meets talented trainers from (4:14 - 4:18)
other powerful pokemon that call the (4:16 - 4:21)
ancient hasui region home (4:18 - 4:24)
discover a new type of shiny pokemon (4:21 - 4:26)
radiant pokemon (4:24 - 4:27)
charge (4:26 - 4:30)
courageously into battle in a new world (4:27 - 4:32)
with the pokemon tcg sword and shield (4:30 - 4:35)
astral radiance expansion (4:32 - 4:36)
i'm assuming this is already out in (4:35 - 4:38)
japan yeah (4:36 - 4:40)
uh yes japan just got this like a week (4:38 - 4:41)
ago (4:40 - 4:43)
so although there should be out there (4:41 - 4:44)
right (4:43 - 4:46)
yes yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so there (4:44 - 4:49)
are 180 cards three brand new radiant (4:46 - 4:51)
pokemon so there's a shiny quote (4:49 - 4:52)
whatever that means (4:51 - 4:54)
um actually i don't know (4:52 - 4:56)
again they're in japan so you could (4:54 - 4:57)
probably look them up i (4:56 - 5:00)
my guess is they're the shiny starters (4:57 - 5:02)
uh but i actually don't know i i should (5:00 - 5:03)
look that up eight (5:02 - 5:05)
awesome (5:03 - 5:07)
pokemon their words not mine eight (5:05 - 5:10)
awesome pokemon v star (5:07 - 5:14)
21 powerful pokemon v and two enormous (5:10 - 5:16)
pokemon v max (5:14 - 5:18)
30 cards with special art of the trainer (5:16 - 5:19)
gallery subset so they're doing the (5:18 - 5:21)
trainer gallery stuff again which is (5:19 - 5:22)
really great (5:21 - 5:23)
um (5:22 - 5:26)
and then more than 20 trainer cards (5:23 - 5:28)
and i believe this is up for pre-order (5:26 - 5:29)
already on pokemon center i think the (5:28 - 5:32)
etb is like a dark cry (5:29 - 5:34)
yes so (5:32 - 5:36)
um (5:34 - 5:39)
there is some confusion around this (5:36 - 5:42)
set i will explain (5:39 - 5:47)
even though we are in the world of (5:42 - 5:47)
an unfortunate remake which is brilliant (5:47 - 5:52)
diamond shining pearl and a (5:49 - 5:55)
and a (5:52 - 5:57)
game that is set in hisino but it's not (5:55 - 6:00)
called cinno because it's called hasui (5:57 - 6:02)
you'll notice that the tcg set is still (6:00 - 6:05)
called sword and shield (6:02 - 6:08)
yeah i was i was confused about that one (6:05 - 6:10)
but i assume that's because it's part of (6:08 - 6:11)
this (6:10 - 6:12)
cycle (6:11 - 6:15)
yes so the last time they did like a (6:12 - 6:18)
subcycle was uh heart gold soul silver (6:15 - 6:20)
which was after diamond and pearl (6:18 - 6:23)
and then they went into black and white (6:20 - 6:24)
and obviously black and white and black (6:23 - 6:26)
and white too were back to back so they (6:24 - 6:27)
kept black and white throughout the (6:26 - 6:29)
entire set that made sense (6:27 - 6:31)
and then they did x and y and omega ruby (6:29 - 6:33)
alpha sapphire they never acknowledged (6:31 - 6:35)
omega ruby alpha sapphire it was always (6:33 - 6:38)
x and y and it was x and y all the way (6:35 - 6:39)
up to sun and moon (6:38 - 6:41)
and then when it was sun and moon (6:39 - 6:43)
it was sun and moon all the way to sword (6:41 - 6:44)
and shield even though we had like let's (6:43 - 6:46)
go pikachu let's go eevee so (6:44 - 6:49)
they just stick with (6:46 - 6:50)
the like (6:49 - 6:53)
generation i guess is the easiest way to (6:50 - 6:54)
say it (6:53 - 6:55)
but they did do diamond and pearl and (6:54 - 6:58)
they did do heart gold soul silver but (6:55 - 6:59)
black and white was the divide where (6:58 - 7:00)
like (6:59 - 7:02)
we're moving forward with only sticking (7:00 - 7:04)
with the generation itself (7:02 - 7:06)
okay i have (7:04 - 7:09)
a fundamental question (7:06 - 7:11)
is it fun or mental (7:09 - 7:13)
yes (7:11 - 7:13)
a number of people have been sending me (7:14 - 7:18)
this (7:16 - 7:23)
japanese full art gardenia and roserade (7:18 - 7:25)
card which i'm assuming has to be coming (7:23 - 7:28)
from this set (7:25 - 7:30)
uh yeah i'm assuming it's a trainer (7:28 - 7:32)
gallery card yeah (7:30 - 7:32)
so (7:32 - 7:35)
does this mean i could build (7:32 - 7:38)
a decent (7:35 - 7:41)
rosary deck (7:38 - 7:43)
i believe it's (7:41 - 7:46)
not rose rose raid it's a trainer card (7:43 - 7:48)
you can have four trainer cards on your (7:46 - 7:51)
deck if they have it in (7:48 - 7:53)
that that has means they have to have (7:51 - 7:56)
rose raid cards in the set right (7:53 - 7:59)
uh no (7:56 - 7:59)
uh let me see if i have the rosary card (8:01 - 8:05)
that they sent me looks like a pokemon (8:03 - 8:07)
it's got a tax on it it's injections oh (8:05 - 8:08)
no no you're right you're right you're (8:07 - 8:09)
right right yeah it would be a pokemon (8:08 - 8:11)
so like here's here's well this is bad (8:09 - 8:13)
for already listen here's the trainer (8:11 - 8:16)
gallery for de dene (8:13 - 8:18)
so it is a deadening card (8:16 - 8:21)
but it there there is a yes they've done (8:18 - 8:22)
sorry they have done stuff where like (8:21 - 8:25)
the trainer is (8:22 - 8:25)
there's a trainer in a pokemon but it's (8:25 - 8:29)
a trainer card so here's like trainer (8:27 - 8:32)
gallery for area dose but you can see (8:29 - 8:34)
janine (8:32 - 8:35)

the (8:37 - 8:40)
the like (8:41 - 8:46)
moves and stuff for rose raid hey this (8:42 - 8:47)

and six booster packs and a trainer (12:06 - 12:10)
promo card except they're not showing (12:08 - 12:12)
what the trainer promo card is at this (12:10 - 12:14)
at this point (12:12 - 12:16)
so i guess they leaked what the cameras (12:14 - 12:17)
look like (12:16 - 12:19)
yeah they're just the like instinct (12:17 - 12:20)
symbol (12:19 - 12:23)
mystic symbol (12:20 - 12:25)
um those are on pokemon center.com if (12:23 - 12:28)
you want to see what the pins look like (12:25 - 12:28)
i i i get this is fine like this is like (12:32 - 12:37)
a cool (12:35 - 12:40)
collaboration i i don't know if any card (12:37 - 12:42)
in this set is going to be worth (12:40 - 12:44)
anything or like super sought after or (12:42 - 12:45)
if there's like a specific trainer you (12:44 - 12:48)
would need even if there was (12:45 - 12:50)
i can't imagine it would be terribly (12:48 - 12:51)
expensive (12:50 - 12:53)
um (12:51 - 12:54)
thinking you would maybe need four for (12:53 - 12:56)
your deck (12:54 - 12:57)
we don't know how many reprints are (12:56 - 12:59)
going to be we don't know what any of (12:57 - 13:00)
the art looks like yet we just know what (12:59 - 13:04)
the booster packs look like (13:00 - 13:04)
literally know nothing about this and (13:07 - 13:11)
again i kind of think (13:09 - 13:13)
it could be similar to mcchampion's path (13:11 - 13:15)
where like the only reason people bought (13:13 - 13:17)
that set was because there was charizard (13:15 - 13:19)
in it and charizard was worth a lot of (13:17 - 13:20)
money at the time and every other card (13:19 - 13:23)
in that set was (13:20 - 13:24)
not great (13:23 - 13:26)
not (13:24 - 13:26)
not good for anyone not good for people (13:26 - 13:30)
who want to battle not good for people (13:28 - 13:31)
who want to collect (13:30 - 13:33)
um (13:31 - 13:37)
that i want to say that set was (13:33 - 13:40)
68 cards or something it was pretty (13:37 - 13:42)
small (13:40 - 13:42)
um but that makes sense for it to come (13:44 - 13:47)
out in july because pokemon go launched (13:45 - 13:49)
in july so (13:47 - 13:50)
um (13:49 - 13:52)
you'll get the the hype of the pokemon (13:50 - 13:54)
go cards they will get go fest i'm (13:52 - 13:55)
assuming (13:54 - 13:57)
um they'll probably do some like six (13:55 - 13:59)
year anniversary thing where they're (13:57 - 14:01)
like here's one incense and 20 pokeballs (13:59 - 14:03)
happy birthday (14:01 - 14:04)
you're like oh this is the best you're (14:03 - 14:05)
getting (14:04 - 14:09)
[Laughter] (14:05 - 14:09)
well they'll probably hand out professor (14:13 - 14:17)
willow cards that go fast (14:14 - 14:18)
i need one more trip (14:17 - 14:20)
those bad boys (14:18 - 14:25)
i thought you had four i have three i do (14:20 - 14:25)
well give one of your five to will so (14:27 - 14:31)
you both have four (14:29 - 14:32)
okay (14:31 - 14:34)
i'm keeping mine sealed because it's (14:32 - 14:36)
going next to my ancient mew mm-hmm (14:34 - 14:39)
and then i'll be all right (14:36 - 14:39)
value (14:39 - 14:43)
uh this was sent in by chels over in our (14:41 - 14:45)
slack community (14:43 - 14:48)

what is the first edition shadowless (16:51 - 16:55)
holographic character (16:53 - 16:56)
is that the one that everybody sees of (16:55 - 16:59)
charizard like hunched over screaming (16:56 - 17:02)
yeah it's like an original okay the (16:59 - 17:05)
shadow list is the misprint (17:02 - 17:05)
uh it was a are you supposed to have a (17:06 - 17:10)
shadow (17:08 - 17:13)
i i can't the shadow is like it's i (17:10 - 17:14)
can't remember the (17:13 - 17:17)
silliness of shadowless pokemon it's (17:14 - 17:20)
it's like there's a layer (17:17 - 17:22)
that is not printed (17:20 - 17:24)
and i think it has to do with its text (17:22 - 17:27)
oh okay pokemon (17:24 - 17:30)
but i could i i (17:27 - 17:32)
always purposely stayed away from the (17:30 - 17:33)
shadowless stuff because it was (17:32 - 17:35)
it was always like dumb to me (17:33 - 17:37)
like it's like like there's not that (17:35 - 17:39)
many out there most are probably (17:37 - 17:40)
destroyed just because like think of how (17:39 - 17:42)
many kids (17:40 - 17:43)
man handled pokemon cards back in the (17:42 - 17:45)
day but (17:43 - 17:48)
like you'd have to care about catalysts (17:45 - 17:50)
and then like (17:48 - 17:53)
it's so expensive and it's so limited (17:50 - 17:55)
and (17:53 - 17:55)
i have zero interest in that kind of (17:56 - 18:01)
stuff i did a search on google (17:57 - 18:02)
for (18:01 - 18:05)
first edition shadowless (18:02 - 18:07)
hollow charizard (18:05 - 18:10)
there's a listing on ebay (18:07 - 18:13)
i want you to guess the price the buy it (18:10 - 18:15)
now price of this card (18:13 - 18:16)
oh it's probably like 150 thousand (18:15 - 18:18)
dollars (18:16 - 18:21)
oh that's your guess well (18:18 - 18:23)
uh do we have a grade (18:21 - 18:26)
from a grade it says it's 9.5 (18:23 - 18:29)
so i will give you eight thousand (18:26 - 18:31)
dollars (18:29 - 18:35)
the buy it now price (18:31 - 18:35)
is two hundred and forty nine thousand (18:36 - 18:43)
nine hundred and ninety nine dollars and (18:40 - 18:44)
99 cents (18:43 - 18:47)
because that one cent i'm not making it (18:44 - 18:49)
250 (18:47 - 18:50)
000 (18:49 - 18:52)
is really gonna push somebody over to (18:50 - 18:56)
think well it's a deal at that (18:52 - 18:58)
um (18:56 - 19:02)
so we so there is the p pwcc this is (18:58 - 19:03)
where he bought it from (19:02 - 19:06)
which is a marketplace (19:03 - 19:08)
so he did pay so this was sold into (19:06 - 19:11)
december 28th obviously like we just (19:08 - 19:13)
read the article the the judges were (19:11 - 19:15)
like this is the exact card you bought (19:13 - 19:18)
he admitted to it so he did pay (19:15 - 19:20)
uh (19:18 - 19:24)
57 000 for this charizard card that's (19:20 - 19:25)
what it was sold for that's what he paid (19:24 - 19:28)
for it is a beckett (19:25 - 19:32)
1999 base first edition (19:28 - 19:33)
uh (19:32 - 19:35)
charizard hollow rare (19:33 - 19:38)
centering is a nine edges 9.5 corners (19:35 - 19:41)
9.5 surface 9.5 (19:38 - 19:44)
uh shadowless yes shadowless (19:41 - 19:46)
so i guess this would theoretically be (19:44 - 19:49)
the accurate price right like it sold (19:46 - 19:51)
yeah to a person (19:49 - 19:54)
so mr ebay for 250 000 you know he's (19:51 - 19:55)
asking (19:54 - 19:59)
they're asking uh uh a lot more almost (19:55 - 20:02)
five times the amount (19:59 - 20:04)
uh you know let's let's ignore the (20:02 - 20:09)
prison part of this article and say (20:04 - 20:10)
57 000 (20:09 - 20:14)
for a piece of cardboard (20:10 - 20:16)
is really (20:14 - 20:18)
unreal you can't put a price on (20:16 - 20:20)
happiness although do look at the card (20:18 - 20:24)
that i just linked in our shared chat (20:20 - 20:28)
and how much that is going for (20:24 - 20:28)
oh this baseball card that is a football (20:29 - 20:35)

means yeah (20:48 - 20:52)
bgs 8.5 (20:49 - 20:55)

but like the real money was always (22:15 - 22:22)
in sports cards the real the real (22:19 - 22:23)
problem is pokemon cards did you not see (22:22 - 22:26)
them fight over pokemon cards (22:23 - 22:27)
you didn't see them fight over sports (22:26 - 22:30)

i have a sick strat that i'm using this (25:07 - 25:14)
time around (25:11 - 25:17)
by sick i just mean it really gets (25:14 - 25:19)
people upset (25:17 - 25:20)
um (25:19 - 25:22)

whatever my held item is for their held (25:25 - 25:30)
item and it's holding choice scarf (25:27 - 25:33)
so basically whatever i take from them (25:30 - 25:34)
but then they're stuck on whatever (25:33 - 25:38)
stupid move (25:34 - 25:38)
i don't care what i take from them (25:39 - 25:47)
[Laughter] (25:43 - 25:47)
look my rose rate is dominating right (25:47 - 25:51)
now that's all i have to say nice i have (25:49 - 25:54)
an all fire team i'm sure it is (25:51 - 25:57)
i have those are the scary (25:54 - 25:57)
it's like when will and i would go to (26:00 - 26:04)
like tcg events together and there would (26:02 - 26:07)
be like the meta decks of like (26:04 - 26:08)
oh you're playing (26:07 - 26:10)
typhlosion restrain i know exactly what (26:08 - 26:12)
this does i know exactly how to stop it (26:10 - 26:14)
and then you sit across from somebody (26:12 - 26:16)
and they're playing like (26:14 - 26:19)
they're playing like a huntail whale (26:16 - 26:21)
lord and you're like can (26:19 - 26:23)
can i read your card because i have no (26:21 - 26:26)
clue what it's doing like (26:23 - 26:26)
like you just you just don't know how so (26:26 - 26:30)
like when i'm battling in in the i see (26:28 - 26:32)
and i'm like okay they're using evital (26:30 - 26:34)
all right they got dessert okay they got (26:32 - 26:36)
zashian i know hannah h (26:34 - 26:37)
how to handle all this (26:36 - 26:40)
and then all of a sudden you see like (26:37 - 26:41)
avalog (26:40 - 26:44)
the hexaflux doing i don't know anything (26:41 - 26:45)
about avalon i don't know it's abilities (26:44 - 26:47)
i don't know if it's move sets i don't (26:45 - 26:49)
know how strong it is if you if you come (26:47 - 26:51)
across an opponent that starts out with (26:49 - 26:55)
a um oh talonflame and a circuitry yeah (26:51 - 26:59)
guess what you came up against me (26:55 - 26:59)
nobody is currently prepared in this (26:59 - 27:02)
meta (27:01 - 27:04)
for a life due rose raid (27:02 - 27:08)
they never see it coming (27:04 - 27:08)
you know (27:08 - 27:12)
do they need to see it coming when they (27:10 - 27:14)
just they should behemoth played on (27:12 - 27:15)
zashian over and over (27:14 - 27:17)
uh (27:15 - 27:18)
i have my (27:17 - 27:21)
my glorious bolt-on with fire fang that (27:18 - 27:23)
just chomps on them and then they're (27:21 - 27:24)
done (27:23 - 27:26)
win-win (27:24 - 27:28)
across the board (27:26 - 27:28)
so (27:29 - 27:34)
i did have a funny moment with the ic (27:31 - 27:37)
and i think (27:34 - 27:40)
i think it's just funny how (27:37 - 27:43)
zashian is a really dumb pokemon (27:40 - 27:44)
and (27:43 - 27:47)
so suzashian is is the the number one (27:44 - 27:49)
pokemon right now in competitive number (27:47 - 27:51)
two probably being incineroar (27:49 - 27:53)
i love incineroar (27:51 - 27:54)
great (27:53 - 27:57)
like both competitively and as a pokemon (27:54 - 28:00)
you know huge incineroar fan (27:57 - 28:00)
zoshing is really good because of a move (28:01 - 28:05)
called behemoth blade (28:03 - 28:07)
and i i just want to explain how (28:05 - 28:09)
behemoth blade works (28:07 - 28:12)
because it's really dumb (28:09 - 28:13)
and (28:12 - 28:15)
um (28:13 - 28:17)
so when zashian is in crown mode which (28:15 - 28:19)
means it's holding the rusted sword (28:17 - 28:20)
which is (28:19 - 28:22)
the only item zashian should be holding (28:20 - 28:24)
uh its steel type move will turn into (28:22 - 28:26)
behemoth blade so (28:24 - 28:28)
um otherwise it's normally like iron (28:26 - 28:31)
head and then but in crown form it's (28:28 - 28:35)
it's behemoth blade and behemoth blade (28:31 - 28:35)
does a hundred damage steel type move (28:35 - 28:40)
it's a hundred percent accurate and then (28:38 - 28:41)
you have (28:40 - 28:43)
you have um zashian's like other moves (28:41 - 28:44)
which is like normally play rough which (28:43 - 28:47)
is i think like 100 damage 90 accurate (28:44 - 28:48)
and then (28:47 - 28:50)
sometimes you run sacred sword which is (28:48 - 28:52)
whatever like 80 (28:50 - 28:55)
damage 100 accurate ignores (28:52 - 28:57)
defense boost or whatever and then your (28:55 - 28:58)
last move is protect there was very (28:57 - 28:59)
early on where people would run (28:58 - 29:01)
substitute zashian and the reason they (28:59 - 29:03)
would run substitute and not sacred (29:01 - 29:05)
sword is because then they can hide (29:03 - 29:07)
behind the substitute so they cannot get (29:05 - 29:09)
intimidated (29:07 - 29:11)
that was that was the strat oh i set up (29:09 - 29:12)
the substitute you bring out incineroar (29:11 - 29:14)
and cinnaroar can't intimidate me (29:12 - 29:15)
because i'm behind this cute little (29:14 - 29:16)
plush (29:15 - 29:18)
dinosaur creature (29:16 - 29:20)
but then people are just like that's too (29:18 - 29:22)
much work just get rid of get rid of the (29:20 - 29:23)
substitute (29:22 - 29:24)
just (29:23 - 29:26)
just three attacks i also found a (29:24 - 29:28)
japanese player that taught didn't know (29:26 - 29:31)
this didn't know this zashian can learn (29:28 - 29:33)
quick attack it makes sense you're like (29:31 - 29:36)
sure it's a quick dog quick attack uh i (29:33 - 29:38)
didn't know that zashian could learn (29:36 - 29:40)
quick attack nor did i think you that (29:38 - 29:41)
anyone in the entire world would teach (29:40 - 29:44)
josh and quick attack i lost a match (29:41 - 29:46)
because there's ashian (29:44 - 29:48)
in which i paralyzed (29:46 - 29:51)
hit the button quick attack (29:48 - 29:53)
which has priority (29:51 - 29:56)
and they quick attacked me and i died (29:53 - 29:59)
and i was like huh (29:56 - 30:02)
no you won i didn't know that's the way (29:59 - 30:04)
the cookie crumbles (30:02 - 30:07)
uh but apparently the quick attack zashi (30:04 - 30:10)
and meta is very very popular in japan (30:07 - 30:12)
and that was a japanese player i played (30:10 - 30:14)
okay so i (30:12 - 30:16)
watched a person (30:14 - 30:19)
struggle with what move to hit (30:16 - 30:20)
for (30:19 - 30:22)
their opponent right so they're like you (30:20 - 30:24)
know how in pokemon when you select the (30:22 - 30:26)
moves it'll say not very effective super (30:24 - 30:28)
effective whatever right (30:26 - 30:30)
and (30:28 - 30:32)
that's really really helpful because i (30:30 - 30:32)
think (30:32 - 30:34)
uh you know for people who listen to the (30:32 - 30:36)
show i would assume most of them (30:34 - 30:38)
understand type weakness especially if (30:36 - 30:40)
they paid attention to hop and sword and (30:38 - 30:41)
shield right very important type (30:40 - 30:44)
weakness (30:41 - 30:44)
so ideally if if you're like (30:44 - 30:49)
i don't know what to do (30:47 - 30:52)
against this pokemon (30:49 - 30:54)
because there's a lot of pokemon there's (30:52 - 30:56)
a lot of different types there's a lot (30:54 - 30:57)
of things happening there could be a (30:56 - 31:00)
reflect up or shield like (30:57 - 31:03)
intimidates her up right (31:00 - 31:03)
and they (31:03 - 31:08)
i think they were they were against a (31:06 - 31:11)
gyarados so water flying so behemoth (31:08 - 31:14)
blade says not very effective (31:11 - 31:16)
and their other moves are play rough (31:14 - 31:18)
sacred sword sacred sword also not very (31:16 - 31:20)
effective play rough is like not not (31:18 - 31:23)
super effective just not neutral but the (31:20 - 31:25)
the gyarados was dynamaxed and they (31:23 - 31:28)
opted to hit (31:25 - 31:29)
i think i think uh i think they (31:28 - 31:31)
eventually hit behemoth play yeah they (31:29 - 31:33)
did a hit behemoth blade but they were (31:31 - 31:35)
going to hit play rough (31:33 - 31:38)
and i think it's just like a (31:35 - 31:38)
so play rough would have done (31:38 - 31:44)
a hundred damage but had a 10 chance to (31:41 - 31:45)
miss (31:44 - 31:48)
but how behemoth blade works is it does (31:45 - 31:50)
a hundred damage (31:48 - 31:51)
period (31:50 - 31:54)
but if it's dynamaxed it does (31:51 - 31:57)
200 damage and nowhere does the game (31:54 - 31:58)
tell you that (31:57 - 32:01)
right you it does say i think it says (31:58 - 32:02)
like it does more damage to dynamics (32:01 - 32:05)
pokemon it literally doubles it (32:02 - 32:08)
on top of zostian getting the stab bonus (32:05 - 32:11)
same type attack bonus on top of zashian (32:08 - 32:13)
coming out and getting a plus one right (32:11 - 32:16)
away because of its ability intrepid (32:13 - 32:18)
sword (32:16 - 32:18)
so ideally even though it's not super (32:20 - 32:24)
effective (32:23 - 32:27)
there's almost never a reason not to hit (32:24 - 32:30)
behemoth blade because it does (32:27 - 32:32)
so much damage even when it's not super (32:30 - 32:34)
effective which is why (32:32 - 32:35)
power move is (32:34 - 32:38)
yeah that's a lot 200 power move on top (32:35 - 32:41)
of stab that's not even like taking in (32:38 - 32:43)
account the stab and the plus one from (32:41 - 32:45)
intrepid sword and the same type attack (32:43 - 32:49)
bonus it does an incredible amount of (32:45 - 32:50)
damage and that's why i like a pokemon (32:49 - 32:53)
like xerneas which used to be very very (32:50 - 32:55)
popular back in at the sun and moon (32:53 - 32:57)
series um (32:55 - 32:59)
was was so dominant (32:57 - 33:01)
and now you have you have a pokemon like (32:59 - 33:03)
zashi and it's like it doesn't matter (33:01 - 33:05)
what xerneas does because i'm just gonna (33:03 - 33:06)
hit that button that's called behemoth (33:05 - 33:08)
blade and nothing survives (33:06 - 33:11)
it's it's just an incredibly (33:08 - 33:12)
strong move (33:11 - 33:13)
and i think kind of the bummer to (33:12 - 33:16)
behemoth blade is there it's it's almost (33:13 - 33:18)
like they should have made (33:16 - 33:22)
like on a pokemon to challenge zashian (33:18 - 33:24)
they like i'm thinking like maybe like a (33:22 - 33:26)
another dog but instead of like a sword (33:24 - 33:28)
maybe they should like put a big shield (33:26 - 33:29)
on its face (33:28 - 33:32)
and they're like yeah yeah a shield like (33:29 - 33:34)
yeah like if because that's a sword (33:32 - 33:36)
doggo so if they made like a shield (33:34 - 33:38)
doggo that could maybe like counter (33:36 - 33:41)
zashi and would maybe like add balance (33:38 - 33:42)
to the game (33:41 - 33:44)
um (33:42 - 33:44)
but (33:44 - 33:47)
they didn't they made a shield doggo (33:44 - 33:50)
that's hot trash (33:47 - 33:50)
oh (33:52 - 33:54)
they (33:54 - 33:57)
they did yeah it'd be good masters (33:54 - 33:59)
though (33:57 - 33:59)
yeah you know (33:59 - 34:03)
it has to shine somewhere i guess (34:01 - 34:07)
and it shines and masters (34:03 - 34:09)
yeah there's not really like a a real (34:07 - 34:11)
hard counter to zashian there are things (34:09 - 34:13)
that like (34:11 - 34:15)
you know you use a strong ground type (34:13 - 34:17)
move and zashi and dies but (34:15 - 34:19)
that doesn't mean zashi is still not (34:17 - 34:20)
going to be able to click behemoth blade (34:19 - 34:21)
first and (34:20 - 34:24)
take you out (34:21 - 34:24)
uh (34:25 - 34:27)
i hope people are enjoying their battles (34:28 - 34:32)
i guess (34:30 - 34:35)
or at least the reward (34:32 - 34:37)
the thing about the ic is like the first (34:35 - 34:40)
day you get so many wild teams you get (34:37 - 34:42)
so many people that are like using the (34:40 - 34:43)
team they went through the story with (34:42 - 34:45)
you get people that i saw i think uh my (34:43 - 34:47)
friend gabby she tweeted she went up (34:45 - 34:49)
against somebody who had um an iggly (34:47 - 34:52)
buff a clefa a togepi and like a pichu (34:49 - 34:54)
and i was like dang that's like really (34:52 - 34:57)
creative and really cute yeah like (34:54 - 34:58)
obviously they know they're gonna lose (34:57 - 35:00)
but they had like a theme and everything (34:58 - 35:02)
i went up against a team this was this (35:00 - 35:04)
was in the articuno one (35:02 - 35:07)
that it was (35:04 - 35:10)
all of the hasuyan pokemon except they (35:07 - 35:11)
couldn't be hasuyan because it was sword (35:10 - 35:14)
and shield so they had like avalog (35:11 - 35:16)
bravery (35:14 - 35:16)
like regular old cool fish no sandler's (35:17 - 35:22)
not sword and shield (35:20 - 35:22)
um it was very it was like very very (35:23 - 35:27)
clever um (35:25 - 35:31)
i went up against that explosion (35:27 - 35:31)
yeah (35:33 - 35:36)
that sounds awesome yeah it was it was (35:36 - 35:40)
funny yeah i think they forgot about (35:38 - 35:42)
dynamaxing (35:40 - 35:45)
well you can't dynamics and explode (35:42 - 35:47)
uh because (35:45 - 35:49)
their whole plan was to have desktops (35:47 - 35:50)
there (35:49 - 35:52)
and then they would just blow up the (35:50 - 35:53)
other one and it would knock everything (35:52 - 35:55)
out i'm like (35:53 - 35:57)
except i do have intimidate i do have a (35:55 - 36:01)
play rough and i can dynamex so i'm not (35:57 - 36:03)
sure what the long term strategy of this (36:01 - 36:04)
is (36:03 - 36:06)
there was a (36:04 - 36:08)
actual strategy and i think it was (36:06 - 36:11)
season three where people were drawn (36:08 - 36:12)
to kind of a similar thing like dust (36:11 - 36:14)
claps and then they rode around like (36:12 - 36:15)
type (36:14 - 36:18)
null or yeah that means it started yeah (36:15 - 36:20)
yeah yeah yeah yeah that was a real real (36:18 - 36:23)
old yeah yeah yeah (36:20 - 36:25)
there's lots of pokemon that can explode (36:23 - 36:26)
for sure (36:25 - 36:32)
they lost due to my superior tactics (36:26 - 36:34)
you know mess sprit can learn explosion (36:32 - 36:35)
right (36:34 - 36:38)
no not mess print sorry um azov (36:35 - 36:41)
um (36:38 - 36:41)
uh yeah i i (36:42 - 36:47)
day one was a lot of like (36:44 - 36:49)
very (36:47 - 36:51)
obvious that people are here to get (36:49 - 36:53)
their bird and leave (36:51 - 36:56)
and then day two was (36:53 - 36:58)
oh those people are gone well some (36:56 - 37:00)
people like that because i (36:58 - 37:02)
only started today i didn't (37:00 - 37:04)
even remember that it was going on (37:02 - 37:05)
yesterday (37:04 - 37:07)
i actually did it (37:05 - 37:09)
thursday night because i couldn't (37:07 - 37:11)
because i was going out friday so i (37:09 - 37:12)
started it i was (37:11 - 37:15)
i don't know why i thought (37:12 - 37:17)
it wouldn't be all japanese players that (37:15 - 37:20)
was going up against (37:17 - 37:21)
uh but it (37:20 - 37:25)
was oh my gosh my second day was almost (37:21 - 37:26)
all japanese players i don't know if (37:25 - 37:28)
people know this but (37:26 - 37:30)
for these ics (37:28 - 37:32)
um international challenges (37:30 - 37:36)
the japanese players do have to qualify (37:32 - 37:39)
this is their qualifying event for the (37:36 - 37:42)
uh japan national tournament (37:39 - 37:43)
so (37:42 - 37:46)
like they are not like extra try like (37:43 - 37:47)
they're just trying hard because like (37:46 - 37:50)
they they need to perform well (37:47 - 37:52)
because that's how they get into their (37:50 - 37:54)
national championship (37:52 - 37:55)
so every (37:54 - 37:57)
every japanese player i fought against i (37:55 - 37:59)
i felt like my brain was going to (37:57 - 38:01)
explode because of like (37:59 - 38:03)
how well they were (38:01 - 38:07)
playing um and the japanese meta is like (38:03 - 38:09)
slightly different than the american (38:07 - 38:10)
meta like they (38:09 - 38:12)
and that was always the same thing in (38:10 - 38:14)
the tcg like they always (38:12 - 38:16)
played decks that were (38:14 - 38:17)
slightly different (38:16 - 38:19)
um (38:17 - 38:21)
than than like zashian with with quick (38:19 - 38:23)
attack like it (38:21 - 38:26)
you don't expect it and it does what it (38:23 - 38:28)
needed to do like i need to do a little (38:26 - 38:30)
bit of damage before i die and (38:28 - 38:32)
zashian is strong enough with intrepid (38:30 - 38:34)
sword to do that little bit of damage (38:32 - 38:35)
and (38:34 - 38:37)
it worked it won them the match because (38:35 - 38:38)
if they didn't have quick attack they (38:37 - 38:39)
wouldn't have won (38:38 - 38:42)
like it was a really good tech for them (38:39 - 38:44)
um and to be honest like i can't even (38:42 - 38:45)
remember the last time i hit sacred (38:44 - 38:47)
sword like it's a fighting type move (38:45 - 38:48)
and (38:47 - 38:50)
i'm sure there was out of the 30 matches (38:48 - 38:52)
i've done maybe i hit it once but you (38:50 - 38:55)
know thinking about that quick attack (38:52 - 38:56)
i probably would have been able to hit (38:55 - 38:58)
quick attack like five times like it (38:56 - 39:00)
probably would have actually (38:58 - 39:02)
it's too late now all of a sudden all (39:00 - 39:03)
the american players are gonna be (39:02 - 39:04)
running quick attacks yeah but you gave (39:03 - 39:06)
away all the secrets (39:04 - 39:08)
i did i did (39:06 - 39:10)
speaking of secrets let's take a break (39:08 - 39:16)
uh that was a okay transition wasn't it (39:10 - 39:16)

i don't know i don't i don't know if (56:42 - 56:44)
they take it out because once you redeem (56:43 - 56:46)
it it's in your collection so i don't (56:44 - 56:49)
know if they removed it (56:46 - 56:51)
i i don't know (56:49 - 56:52)
because that's like a weird thing saying (56:51 - 56:54)
we're (56:52 - 56:55)
putting this shirt up because i think (56:54 - 56:59)
it's been there the entire time (56:55 - 57:02)

um (57:02 - 57:04)

oricorio is (57:11 - 57:14)
fine it's like an okay pokemon (57:14 - 57:19)
it's cute (57:17 - 57:19)
i guess what we need is more forms and (57:21 - 57:25)
more items to change them into those (57:23 - 57:26)
forms (57:25 - 57:28)
i mean more flowers (57:26 - 57:32)
yeah we need pollen what is it nectar (57:28 - 57:32)
nectar no see they can't this is why (57:32 - 57:38)
they can't put nectar into pogo (57:34 - 57:40)
they put all the nectar in the pikmin oh (57:38 - 57:43)
so actually this is the strat you play (57:40 - 57:44)
both games (57:43 - 57:46)
and then they'll release a patch where (57:44 - 57:48)
pikmin can run nectar over to your (57:46 - 57:50)
origaria yeah that's how they should do (57:48 - 57:52)
it they'll get more people to play (57:50 - 57:53)
pikmin (57:52 - 57:56)
synergies yeah they're like okay you can (57:53 - 57:58)
change oracle's form you just have to (57:56 - 58:00)
play pikmin to collect the net connector (57:58 - 58:01)
to send it over it's like pokemon sleep (58:00 - 58:04)
you know you send the data over (58:01 - 58:06)
just pick them in bloom (58:04 - 58:08)
or do you mean it's like pokemon sleep (58:06 - 58:10)
doesn't exist (58:08 - 58:10)
pokemon sleep is real i saw the hack (58:11 - 58:16)
data for it (58:13 - 58:16)
we talked about that already jeez we (58:16 - 58:22)
talk about everything already (58:19 - 58:26)
uh that's all that's all the news i got (58:22 - 58:26)
so that leads us to uh question of the (58:26 - 58:29)
week (58:28 - 58:32)
uh sure does (58:29 - 58:32)
i had a good youtube one too so let me (58:33 - 58:37)
look this one up that's i i read all the (58:34 - 58:40)
youtube comments you are not i (58:37 - 58:43)
did i read that i think i read one (58:40 - 58:45)
and commented (58:43 - 58:47)
on that one (58:45 - 58:49)
that's your problem was commenting (58:47 - 58:51)
i (58:49 - 58:51)
i do what my husband does this is drive (58:52 - 58:56)
by commenting uh which is you comment (58:53 - 58:57)
and then you probably forget what you (58:56 - 58:59)
did and you never look at it again (58:57 - 59:01)
you know i actually what i need to do is (58:59 - 59:04)
to create a new google account so that i (59:01 - 59:06)
can reply and people won't know it's me (59:04 - 59:08)
so i can put in replies like don't you (59:06 - 59:12)
think it's rude to call people old (59:08 - 59:12)
no okay the the period the comment that (59:13 - 59:18)
said you guys are adorable old men i did (59:16 - 59:20)
not take offense too i thought it was (59:18 - 59:22)
very cute (59:20 - 59:24)
and yet i did (59:22 - 59:25)
i am not (59:24 - 59:28)
only 47. (59:25 - 59:30)
i'm old (59:28 - 59:30)
struggled to get out of bed this morning (59:31 - 59:36)
uh all right question (59:34 - 59:39)
of the week that's what it is (59:36 - 59:42)
it's the question of the week (59:39 - 59:42)
i did not see the adorable old men one (59:44 - 59:47)
oh i (59:46 - 59:51)
i mean i'm old i can't argue with that (59:47 - 59:55)
i like to think of myself as a survivor (59:51 - 59:55)
i survived the 70s and the 80s when our (59:56 - 60:01)
parents were actively trying to kill us (59:59 - 60:03)
absolutely correct (60:01 - 60:06)
correct (60:03 - 60:06)
ah pat says if you could have a job in (60:06 - 60:11)
the pokemon universe that wasn't gym (60:09 - 60:14)
leader or trainer what would you be (60:11 - 60:16)
uh and why would you choose that job (60:14 - 60:17)
that's actually a really good question (60:16 - 60:18)
because like i think most people would (60:17 - 60:21)
be like the default is like breeder (60:18 - 60:23)
trainer gym leader i guess you could say (60:21 - 60:26)
breeder but i mean i feel like trainer (60:23 - 60:28)
like if you watch every profession has a (60:26 - 60:30)
pokemon with them so they are ready to (60:28 - 60:32)
throw down at any moment (60:30 - 60:33)
so i feel like (60:32 - 60:35)
everybody's a trainer (60:33 - 60:37)
so i would probably just keep my high (60:35 - 60:39)
paying corporate job (60:37 - 60:40)
and be like on the weekends stop in (60:39 - 60:43)
elementary school kids (60:40 - 60:44)
so no one (60:43 - 60:46)
no one ever says they want to be like an (60:44 - 60:48)
oleana like uh like a secretary to a (60:46 - 60:51)
very powerful man i mean but the thing (60:48 - 60:52)
is (60:51 - 60:54)
also administrative assistant thank you (60:52 - 60:56)
very much secretary yeah that we don't (60:54 - 60:58)
use that word anymore um greg you would (60:56 - 61:00)
be you would have your high paid (60:58 - 61:02)
corporate job and be a trainer but the (61:00 - 61:04)
elementary school kids would come (61:02 - 61:07)
wandering through your business oh yes (61:04 - 61:09)
and challenge you (61:07 - 61:11)
work the yeah day at work something (61:09 - 61:13)
becomes bring your kid to work day (61:11 - 61:15)
because it's on kids constant challenges (61:13 - 61:18)
i have been training this team forever (61:15 - 61:20)
um i would also like (61:18 - 61:23)
since money is clearly not an issue (61:20 - 61:25)
because they give it away like water in (61:23 - 61:26)
these games (61:25 - 61:28)
i i would happily be a profes i would be (61:26 - 61:31)
a researcher i'd research stuff (61:28 - 61:34)
i'd be like an alternate my you know (61:31 - 61:39)
professor that studies alternate forms (61:34 - 61:39)
i would be a public radio dj (61:39 - 61:43)
yeah but radio stations constantly get (61:43 - 61:48)
taken over by team rocket like that (61:46 - 61:50)
every other day (61:48 - 61:53)
every other day (61:50 - 61:53)
steve what is your job (61:56 - 61:59)

question of the week steve if you will (63:51 - 63:55)
and greg were each a starter pokemon of (63:53 - 63:57)
the game which of you would be water (63:55 - 63:58)
which of you would be grass which would (63:57 - 64:00)
you be fire (63:58 - 64:01)
and then what would your final (64:00 - 64:04)
evolution's second typing be i'm (64:01 - 64:07)
i mean clearly that will is fire you are (64:04 - 64:09)
water i am grass like that is not even a (64:07 - 64:11)
question i think that's pretty clear (64:09 - 64:14)
correct i think that yeah (64:11 - 64:16)
this might be the only time we've all (64:14 - 64:18)
agreed on the show is that even a (64:16 - 64:19)
question (64:18 - 64:23)
my final form of course is grass fairy (64:19 - 64:24)
type (64:23 - 64:27)
one thousand percent interesting (64:24 - 64:29)
are you assuming that all gay people (64:27 - 64:30)
like fairy type (64:29 - 64:33)
no i'm saying i like fairy tale how rude (64:30 - 64:37)
yeah say that i had to be fairy type (64:33 - 64:39)
how awful (64:37 - 64:41)
nothing well it goes well i'm fire (64:39 - 64:42)
fairies (64:41 - 64:45)
no thank you (64:42 - 64:45)
would be really good will (64:45 - 64:48)
uh i mean it would be okay it's just not (64:48 - 64:53)
what i want to be thank you (64:51 - 64:57)
okay what is your second type (64:53 - 64:57)
what a dragon i'm super effective (64:58 - 65:04)
against you i'll pounce into the ground (65:00 - 65:04)
um (65:04 - 65:08)
ah gosh there was there's a lot that i (65:05 - 65:10)
would (65:08 - 65:10)
probably water fairy (65:11 - 65:14)
why is there anything (65:14 - 65:19)
dang i like fairy types (65:16 - 65:22)
so do i (65:19 - 65:22)
i guess water dark then yeah there we go (65:25 - 65:31)
then i'm most likely going to be (65:28 - 65:34)
fire steel (65:31 - 65:35)
oh (65:34 - 65:37)
do (65:35 - 65:37)
could i be fire ice (65:40 - 65:43)
oh fire ice is real good (65:45 - 65:49)
fire poison we do have a fire poison (65:47 - 65:52)
already yeah (65:49 - 65:52)
i think fire ice is good fire ice all (65:53 - 65:58)
right so fire ice (65:56 - 66:02)
grass fairy and water dark (65:58 - 66:02)
fan heard it (66:04 - 66:09)
[Laughter] (66:05 - 66:13)
please don't fan art it (66:09 - 66:13)
uh (66:14 - 66:18)
well pokemon of the week all right last (66:15 - 66:21)
week's pokemon was blah blah blah (66:18 - 66:25)
pokemon tcg cards expanded format goes (66:21 - 66:26)
all the way back to black and white set (66:25 - 66:28)
one (66:26 - 66:30)
uh there's a few cards that are banned (66:28 - 66:33)
and restricted in the (66:30 - 66:34)
uh (66:33 - 66:36)
expanded format and i was referencing (66:34 - 66:38)
one of them i said it's banned because (66:36 - 66:40)
of a similar reason to another card (66:38 - 66:42)
which is auron guru (66:40 - 66:44)
which kind of allows you to go infinite (66:42 - 66:47)
on retrieving energy (66:44 - 66:48)
from the discard so you have like (66:47 - 66:51)
infinite energy to do horrible things (66:48 - 66:52)
it's used basically used in control (66:51 - 66:53)
decks (66:52 - 66:57)
it's also a favorite pokemon of (66:53 - 66:59)
greg and i (66:57 - 67:01)
and one of the few stuffed toys that i (66:59 - 67:05)
pokemon toys that i own (67:01 - 67:07)
so there you go (67:05 - 67:10)
it's (67:07 - 67:13)
sableye jigglypuff from above (67:10 - 67:16)
why how come steve got it right this (67:13 - 67:18)
time (67:16 - 67:18)
that's weird and i don't know if people (67:18 - 67:21)
could see in the youtube video that i (67:19 - 67:23)
literally put disable eye over my right (67:21 - 67:24)
shoulder (67:23 - 67:26)
so (67:24 - 67:26)
yeah i don't know if the sibling appears (67:26 - 67:33)
on the youtube i love sableye so much (67:28 - 67:35)
it's a good pokemon uh um let's see what (67:33 - 67:37)
we got for trivia here (67:35 - 67:39)
it's based off of (67:37 - 67:41)
seems to be the counterpart of mall (67:39 - 67:43)
while both are version exclusive to ruby (67:41 - 67:45)
and sapphire heart gold soul silver (67:43 - 67:47)
omega ruby and alpha sapphire and sword (67:45 - 67:48)
and shield (67:47 - 67:50)
both have mega evolved forms and the (67:48 - 67:52)
same base stat totals as well as hp and (67:50 - 67:54)
speed (67:52 - 67:56)
stable eye shares the category with (67:54 - 67:57)
murkrow they're both known as the (67:56 - 67:59)
darkness pokemon (67:57 - 68:02)
stabilize the only ghost pokemon in the (67:59 - 68:04)
human like egg group (68:02 - 68:07)
uh mega stable eye is the slowest dark (68:04 - 68:10)
pokemon i didn't actually know that (68:07 - 68:12)
prior to the introduction of fairy type (68:10 - 68:13)
and gen (68:12 - 68:16)
6 sableye along with spirit tomb had no (68:13 - 68:18)
elemental weakness under normal battle (68:16 - 68:20)
conditions using foresight can expose (68:18 - 68:23)
dark type 2 fighting type (68:20 - 68:24)
as this occurred without the aid of an (68:23 - 68:26)
ability it was commonly hacked to have (68:24 - 68:28)
the ability wonderguard making it immune (68:26 - 68:30)
to all direct damage the hack is (68:28 - 68:33)
normally referred to as wonder eye (68:30 - 68:35)
i don't know what hack they're talking (68:33 - 68:36)
about (68:35 - 68:39)
no like literally (68:36 - 68:39)
metagame terminology got it (68:45 - 68:49)
interesting (68:49 - 68:53)
that's a very long article oh the meta (68:50 - 68:55)
game termite analogy has like the fear (68:53 - 68:56)
strap yeah (68:55 - 69:00)
uh the shuffle icons are great (68:56 - 69:04)
the shiny is great good (69:00 - 69:06)
they are great especially the one where (69:04 - 69:08)
he's wearing a bow tie (69:06 - 69:10)
shiny is good (69:08 - 69:11)
wow chinese what bothers me about (69:10 - 69:13)
chinese hmm (69:11 - 69:14)
oh here we go (69:13 - 69:18)
strap in for another hour folks (69:14 - 69:21)
like sometimes the shiny changes and (69:18 - 69:23)
then something doesn't change like for (69:21 - 69:25)
example (69:23 - 69:28)
um komala like the log changes but he (69:25 - 69:31)
stays the same (69:28 - 69:35)
and then this is on a different log yeah (69:31 - 69:36)
he is the log that's what makes but like (69:35 - 69:42)
sableye the gem changes as well (69:36 - 69:42)
there's just like not a consistency (69:43 - 69:46)
there like why does there have to be (69:44 - 69:48)
consistency (69:46 - 69:50)
i don't know i mean the gem (69:48 - 69:52)
like why why does one machamp (69:50 - 69:54)
or machoke they're shiny like their (69:52 - 69:56)
underwear changes color (69:54 - 69:59)
like because it's a part of their body (69:56 - 70:03)
it it's got the (69:59 - 70:03)
cannot take those garments off no (70:03 - 70:08)
they're not whatever rule 34 thing (70:08 - 70:12)
you're reading yeah (70:10 - 70:14)
uh sableye has a red (70:12 - 70:17)
gem (70:14 - 70:17)
shiny form it's got a green gem and it (70:21 - 70:25)
manifests a giant green gem (70:23 - 70:28)
it's all consistent (70:25 - 70:28)
but what about kamala (70:30 - 70:34)
what about it (70:31 - 70:37)
it's on a different tree what about (70:34 - 70:39)
machoke's underwear it's not about (70:37 - 70:41)
underwear (70:39 - 70:43)
what about jinx's (70:41 - 70:46)
dress there's a pokedex entry that say (70:43 - 70:49)
that she can change her clothes (70:46 - 70:51)
wow (70:49 - 70:51)
also if you played the original pokemon (70:51 - 70:55)
snap her hair comes off (70:52 - 70:57)
it's true it's a wig (70:55 - 70:59)
it's very disturbing honestly are you (70:57 - 71:01)
ready for this week's pokemon i i can't (70:59 - 71:04)
answer these questions all right here we (71:01 - 71:06)
go (71:04 - 71:08)
you will know the name of this week's (71:06 - 71:11)
pokemon until i ask you to remember it (71:08 - 71:13)
there are two three-letter pokemon names (71:11 - 71:16)
in kanto that start with the same letter (71:13 - 71:18)
only one appears to be derived from a (71:16 - 71:20)
word that can mean most almost (71:18 - 71:23)
completely opposite things depending on (71:20 - 71:25)
the context in which it is used (71:23 - 71:28)
sometimes it has the skill to gain the (71:25 - 71:30)
ability of a fallen comrade (71:28 - 71:33)
that's all (71:30 - 71:33)
see the minute i ask you to think of it (71:34 - 71:38)
you can't remember what it is absolutely (71:36 - 71:40)
all gone (71:38 - 71:43)
from my head i am leaving a blank (71:40 - 71:44)
i'm gonna have to rely on pokemon of the (71:43 - 71:46)
