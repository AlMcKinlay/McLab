was a a roulette wheel spin of who it (0:36 - 0:42)
could be I spent my entire day playing (0:39 - 0:44)
something that wasn't Pokemon so it's (0:42 - 0:46)
going to take me uh a few minutes to get (0:44 - 0:50)
my gears shifted since I suffer from the (0:46 - 0:52)
oldd and uh and getting back into the (0:50 - 0:56)
Pokemon train of thought but Choo Cho CH (0:52 - 1:00)
on the train all right all right I also (0:56 - 1:02)
have have Travis with us today yeah I (1:00 - 1:06)
don't I don't have anything can't can't (1:02 - 1:08)
can't win them all I don't have a joke (1:06 - 1:11)
this week no no Goofs for grov is (1:08 - 1:15)
nope are we on Gro or septile I think (1:11 - 1:17)
septile no cuz wasn't just last week the (1:15 - 1:20)
first gen 3 week yeah no Gro you're (1:17 - 1:21)
right you're right I don't know why I (1:20 - 1:23)
flipped the two cuz I I clearly don't (1:21 - 1:27)
know my any Pokemon ever well that's (1:23 - 1:30)
again yeah that's been demonstrated Gro (1:27 - 1:33)
has a very important part to play in (1:30 - 1:36)
Pokemon Mystery Dungeon explorers of (1:33 - 1:38)
Time explorers of darkness and explorers (1:36 - 1:42)
of Sky sure people played those games at (1:38 - 1:45)
one point in time I would assume some of (1:42 - 1:47)
my favorite Pokemon games that I don't (1:45 - 1:51)
understand but I mean to each their own (1:47 - 1:54)
as they say yeah I I like Pokemon (1:51 - 1:57)
Shuffle that's a real good spin-off game (1:54 - 1:59)
oh and I like uh Pokemon picross which (1:57 - 2:01)
is not a good spin-off game but it's (1:59 - 2:03)
certainly a way to waste your time I (2:01 - 2:07)
like the the the con I I actually I like (2:03 - 2:09)
pick cross a lot I just didn't like the (2:07 - 2:12)
way Pokemon pick cross went about its (2:09 - 2:14)
business uh before we get into our show (2:12 - 2:16)
if you're joining us today because we (2:14 - 2:18)
have an interview with Gunda Chris AKA (2:16 - 2:22)

for the exact time when that is in I (2:33 - 2:36)
actually recorded that yesterday so I'm (2:34 - 2:38)
not sure how uh how long we're going to (2:36 - 2:42)
ramble before we get to her interview (2:38 - 2:44)
but she's really awesome really great (2:42 - 2:45)
can't wait for that she'll talk about (2:44 - 2:48)
destroying Pikachu amiibos and and who (2:45 - 2:50)
wouldn't like (2:48 - 2:53)
that so before we get into before we get (2:50 - 2:55)
into things uh our show is going to come (2:53 - 2:56)
down to some Pokémon news it might be a (2:55 - 2:59)
little heavy on the Pokémon go since we (2:56 - 3:01)
just got generation 2 we'll talk about (2:59 - 3:04)
that and you guys actually sent in a ton (3:01 - 3:06)
of emails this week a lot a lot of (3:04 - 3:08)
emails so I wanted to try to stay on top (3:06 - 3:09)
of emails we're going to try to get to (3:08 - 3:11)
most of them uh this show and then (3:09 - 3:14)
Travis has our Pokemon of the week as (3:11 - 3:17)
well so that is our format for you guys (3:14 - 3:20)
today probably a 2-hour show because uh (3:17 - 3:21)
the interview was (3:20 - 3:25)
3540 minutes long probably after it gets (3:21 - 3:27)
cut down and cleaned up like I said (3:25 - 3:29)
before we get on to that what's up guys (3:27 - 3:32)
what's new what's going on what's (3:29 - 3:34)
happening I've probably had the busiest (3:32 - 3:36)
Saturday that I've had in a very very (3:34 - 3:38)
long time because not only did I (3:36 - 3:40)
exercise but I went to a Vanguard (3:38 - 3:43)
competition for most of the day and I (3:40 - 3:45)
got my haircut three things outside of (3:43 - 3:47)
the house on a Saturday this is an (3:45 - 3:49)
accomplishment for William Anderson (3:47 - 3:51)
three things Saturday yeah Saturday is (3:49 - 3:54)
usually nap day yeah go go to the gym (3:51 - 3:56)
come home go back to (3:54 - 3:58)
bed there's nothing wrong with that but (3:56 - 4:00)
it is I am proud of you for getting out (3:58 - 4:03)
of the bed and and yeah and being social (4:00 - 4:05)
at the Vanguard competition and (4:03 - 4:06)
interacting with other human beings (4:05 - 4:09)
competi really uh it was a tournament (4:06 - 4:12)
yeah did you win I lost every single (4:09 - 4:16)
well yes I lost every game that boy I (4:12 - 4:18)
could only save for two rounds you know (4:16 - 4:22)
honestly the so the reason I went was (4:18 - 4:23)
because this is going to get long and (4:22 - 4:26)
drawn out the I'll try to keep it from (4:23 - 4:28)
getting long and drawn out the person (4:26 - 4:30)
who runs the Saturday Vanguard league in (4:28 - 4:33)
the DC area which is where I first (4:30 - 4:35)
started playing Vanguard was recently in (4:33 - 4:38)
a really really bad car accident so the (4:35 - 4:40)
tournament today was held as a (4:38 - 4:42)
fundraiser just to help him you know get (4:40 - 4:45)
back on his feet uh so I went to donate (4:42 - 4:48)
some money and um I actually donated a (4:45 - 4:52)
very uh relatively expensive card a $40 (4:48 - 4:54)
card to for them to give away as a prize (4:52 - 4:57)
as part of the tournament so for me it (4:54 - 4:59)
was more supporting this guy who helped (4:57 - 5:01)
me get into Vang guard than it was about (4:59 - 5:02)
actually trying to win anything since I (5:01 - 5:05)
knew I had to leave early for my haircut (5:02 - 5:07)
so that I could be the handsome and (5:05 - 5:09)
beautiful person that you all enjoy (5:07 - 5:10)
looking at every day yeah you have to (5:09 - 5:12)
look good right yeah and I also (5:10 - 5:15)
scheduled a touchup for the day before I (5:12 - 5:18)
travel uh further north in this country (5:15 - 5:20)
in March so that I will look good on (5:18 - 5:23)
March 10th as well when we go to packs (5:20 - 5:24)
yeah that'll be at least one of us will (5:23 - 5:27)
look okay yeah I'm trying to get like (5:24 - 5:29)
everything done before that trip I I (5:27 - 5:31)
well you're usually organized so most (5:29 - 5:33)
likely you will but for with us it's (5:31 - 5:35)
like the um Goldilocks and the Three (5:33 - 5:40)
Bears right I've got the baby bear hair (5:35 - 5:42)
Steve's got the although Steve got his (5:40 - 5:44)
haircut for Valentine's Day didn't he no (5:42 - 5:47)
it's still longer than mine so he's got (5:44 - 5:50)
the mama bear hair and then Travis has (5:47 - 5:52)
the papa bear (5:50 - 5:55)
hair and by Just (5:52 - 5:59)
Right Travis anything new on your front (5:55 - 6:00)
oh boy well it's (5:59 - 6:04)
actually getting a little warmer here (6:00 - 6:07)
which is very early for my part of the (6:04 - 6:09)
country here in West Michigan you (6:07 - 6:11)
wouldn't expect in the middle of (6:09 - 6:16)
February to have weather in the 50s of (6:11 - 6:17)
degrees that's Fahrenheit of course I'm (6:16 - 6:21)
not uh boiling oh boiling would be 100 (6:17 - 6:24)
Celsius but still is it is 100 boiling (6:21 - 6:26)
in Celsius let me get my let me get my (6:24 - 6:29)
nearest Canadian adviser on the phone (6:26 - 6:30)
here to (6:29 - 6:33)
100° C is the boiling point of water 0 (6:30 - 6:35)
degrees celsus is the freezing point of (6:33 - 6:37)
water that is what the entire Celsius (6:35 - 6:40)
scale is based on well at least I (6:37 - 6:41)
vaguely knew that that's what it was (6:40 - 6:46)
it's kind of gonna I have a hard time (6:41 - 6:48)
learning that sort of thing it took me a (6:46 - 6:50)
very long time even I feel feel like it (6:48 - 6:52)
took me longer than my peers as a child (6:50 - 6:56)
to even be able to understand what 60 (6:52 - 6:57)
versus (6:56 - 7:01)
70° felt like or or miles per hour as (6:57 - 7:04)
well like I I wouldn't have been able to (7:01 - 7:09)
tell you what 30 versus 50 felt like (7:04 - 7:12)
until after most people so the prospect (7:09 - 7:14)
of having to relearn all of that even (7:12 - 7:16)
though I completely recognize that the (7:14 - 7:19)
metric system is superior in all (7:16 - 7:22)
conceivable ways it's going to be a bit (7:19 - 7:24)
of a transition for me to have to learn (7:22 - 7:26)
what all of those new things mean anyway (7:24 - 7:28)
you asked me a question and that was how (7:26 - 7:30)
what have been what have I up to I (7:28 - 7:31)
actually went on a bike ride today in (7:30 - 7:33)
the middle of February what is up with (7:31 - 7:35)
that it was like (7:33 - 7:38)
51° are you Michigan wow are you are you (7:35 - 7:41)
one of these bikers that like they have (7:38 - 7:43)
a fancy bike and they do the work on the (7:41 - 7:47)
bike and no I just like I have a Lamers (7:43 - 7:50)
bike but I like riding it and I ride it (7:47 - 7:52)
a lot of places I don't really care (7:50 - 7:54)
about bikes so to speak but I like (7:52 - 7:57)
taking bike rides does that make sense (7:54 - 7:59)
where was your bike acquired from I (7:57 - 8:01)
don't remember because it was a gift a (7:59 - 8:03)
few years ago so I don't necessarily (8:01 - 8:05)
remember where they said they bought it (8:03 - 8:07)
right the the bright line dividing line (8:05 - 8:12)
between real bicyclists and the regular (8:07 - 8:14)
folks is regular folks get their (8:12 - 8:20)
bicycles at like Target yeah Walmart (8:14 - 8:23)
real bicyclists get their bikes at the (8:20 - 8:27)
bike shop the like familyowned bike shop (8:23 - 8:30)
that's been around for 80 years uh not (8:27 - 8:32)
in DC most of them are haven't been (8:30 - 8:35)
around for 80 years but they're just (8:32 - 8:36)
like the high performance you know (8:35 - 8:38)
you've got to get your bike in for (8:36 - 8:42)
tuneup and uh and take down and whatever (8:38 - 8:45)
else I mean didn't we as kids just get a (8:42 - 8:49)
bike and ride around around the block 30 (8:45 - 8:52)
40 60 times on a day just because that's (8:49 - 8:54)
what we did as kids yeah yeah no I did (8:52 - 8:56)
that did you kids still do that I think (8:54 - 8:59)
it's just adults have are incapable of (8:56 - 9:01)
doing anything with half measures adults (8:59 - 9:03)
are incapable of buying bikes for (9:01 - 9:05)
themselves at Target unless well that's (9:03 - 9:07)
part of it but here's my question say (9:05 - 9:09)
when you guys rode bikes as kids did you (9:07 - 9:13)
guys wear helmets no yes as a child yes (9:09 - 9:17)
but a teenager on no that's that's a (9:13 - 9:18)
dividing line because that was just (9:17 - 9:20)
unheard of there there was no such thing (9:18 - 9:23)
as a bicycle helmet back in my (9:20 - 9:26)
day yeah yeah yeah no I I didn't I (9:23 - 9:29)
didn't wear a helmet at all tell you (9:26 - 9:32)
that yeah I got uh I got nothing new to (9:29 - 9:35)
report I guess well wait you were oh (9:32 - 9:37)
that's different that's Pokemon related (9:35 - 9:40)
oops that that is poke I can I I can (9:37 - 9:42)
transition I can tell a small story and (9:40 - 9:44)
then transition into Pokemon news (9:42 - 9:47)
because Pokemon go just had an update (9:44 - 9:51)
which we'll talk about but I had some (9:47 - 9:54)
like minor surgery on my nose and that (9:51 - 9:57)
prevents me from being out in the direct (9:54 - 9:59)
sunlight for like 6 weeks now it's like (9:57 - 10:03)
like 5 weeks but a real bad timing cuz (9:59 - 10:05)
uh as as as Travis said the weather was (10:03 - 10:08)
super nice it was 60° here in Milwaukee (10:05 - 10:11)
and uh I did I was out a little bit just (10:08 - 10:13)
cuz I had to drive to like a a store and (10:11 - 10:16)
stuff but I have seen people play (10:13 - 10:18)
Pokemon playing Pokémon go now now that (10:16 - 10:20)
the update is out and I'm just thinking (10:18 - 10:23)
to myself like oh this is my first free (10:20 - 10:26)
like freeish weekend in in quite a while (10:23 - 10:29)
and I really want to play Pokémon go and (10:26 - 10:31)
I can't because that involves me being (10:29 - 10:33)
outside and it is really nice out and (10:31 - 10:36)
really sunny and uh I shouldn't be (10:33 - 10:38)
outside so that's my minor story which (10:36 - 10:41)
will lead us I guess into Pokemon news (10:38 - 10:43)
but wait no we got to I'm scared now (10:41 - 10:45)
because that means that Travis has to (10:43 - 10:49)
have a minor medical procedure next week (10:45 - 10:51)
what what will it be I don't know I (10:49 - 10:53)
don't know if yours was minor will yeah (10:51 - 10:56)
it was it was all right it didn't stop (10:53 - 10:59)
me from doing anything for six weeks M (10:56 - 11:00)
well it they just said hey like if you (10:59 - 11:03)
go out in the sun you have to wear the (11:00 - 11:05)
the sunscreen that the zinc sunscreen (11:03 - 11:06)
which I didn't know there was a (11:05 - 11:08)
difference in sunscreen but the the zinc (11:06 - 11:11)
sunscreen I guess is the one that's like (11:08 - 11:14)
the white pasty stuff right that does (11:11 - 11:16)
not allow any light through yes yeah and (11:14 - 11:18)
then there's the other sunscreen which I (11:16 - 11:20)
guess I was always familiar with which (11:18 - 11:22)
is the sunscreen that just kind of soaks (11:20 - 11:25)
into your skin like lotion almost uh yes (11:22 - 11:27)
so that's the difference between (11:25 - 11:30)
sunscreen and sun blocker oh okay and (11:27 - 11:33)
I'm not an outdoor person either that's (11:30 - 11:36)
true how's that Pokémon go well that (11:33 - 11:38)

local neighborhoods with family and (13:37 - 13:40)

where they discourage you from doing (13:40 - 13:44)
that we cannot wait to see what Pokemon (13:42 - 13:46)
you catch and this is exciting for me i' (13:44 - 13:48)
I've actually reinstalled Pokémon go of (13:46 - 13:50)
course because I want to prove you wrong (13:48 - 13:52)
about the Apple watch but uh I mean (13:50 - 13:56)
since squil is like top one of my (13:52 - 13:58)
favorite Pokemon I'm really excited to (13:56 - 14:00)
see this is coming out yeah I played a (13:58 - 14:03)
bit uh the other day and I played a (14:00 - 14:05)
little bit today cuz I had to go to (14:03 - 14:08)
Target and pick up some stuff so (14:05 - 14:09)
Starbucks of course has their little (14:08 - 14:13)
poke stop thing to to give you what your (14:09 - 14:15)
give you your goods very excited to play (14:13 - 14:18)
Pokémon go and I remembered cuz I (14:15 - 14:20)
haven't played Pokémon go in three or (14:18 - 14:22)
four weeks I remembered I had zero (14:20 - 14:23)
pokeballs because at one point I had (14:22 - 14:26)
over 100 and then they all vanished uh (14:23 - 14:27)
so that was a little disappointing to (14:26 - 14:30)
only have great balls and Ultra Balls (14:27 - 14:34)
and when you see nothing but centrance C (14:30 - 14:37)
cus CET centret (14:34 - 14:40)
cets uh when you see nothing but them on (14:37 - 14:42)
your map not really worth wasting a (14:40 - 14:44)
great ball on in my opinion but I'm not (14:42 - 14:47)
going to buy Pokeballs I will just spend (14:44 - 14:50)
a day and find a couple Poké stops and I (14:47 - 14:54)
will spin those until I replenish my (14:50 - 14:56)
stuff I'm not I'm not giving into there (14:54 - 14:58)
buying Pokeball stuff Travis have you (14:56 - 15:00)
played I have technically opened the (14:58 - 15:03)
application since they have added new (15:00 - 15:06)
Pokemon and I saw that there was a natu (15:03 - 15:11)
and a spin rack in the nearby uh what is (15:06 - 15:13)
it called how do I how can I not uh (15:11 - 15:14)
sightings that's what it's called (15:13 - 15:17)
There's A natu and A spinak in (15:14 - 15:24)
sightings however I the new Weedle and (15:17 - 15:27)
Pidgey however I didn't catch them (15:24 - 15:30)
because I guess I just (15:27 - 15:32)
well I think I was working at that point (15:30 - 15:34)
so I was only able to just sort of see (15:32 - 15:36)
what was around I couldn't go out (15:34 - 15:38)
anywhere uh and then the only day it's (15:36 - 15:41)
really been warm enough to go cu the way (15:38 - 15:43)
I play Pokémon go is I go for a walk (15:41 - 15:46)
listen to podcasts and play Pokémon go (15:43 - 15:49)
and the only day that it was both warm (15:46 - 15:52)
enough for me to justify going outside (15:49 - 15:55)
for that long of a period of time and I (15:52 - 15:58)
had free time I opted to bike ride and (15:55 - 16:00)
it's oh a little more dangerous to bike (15:58 - 16:02)
in Pokemon go than it is to walk in (16:00 - 16:04)
Pokemon go so if it continues to be warm (16:02 - 16:07)
out I will definitely get back into it (16:04 - 16:10)
but I just haven't yet yeah I caught uh (16:07 - 16:12)
a couple Pokemon uh let do you guys want (16:10 - 16:14)
to get the money stuff out of the way I (16:12 - 16:17)
mean there's money involved yeah Oh you (16:14 - 16:19)
mean the yeah yeah well here let me ACC (16:17 - 16:21)
let me do most of these news articles (16:19 - 16:23)
are Pokemon go related so let me go (16:21 - 16:25)
through a couple of them here Pokemon go (16:23 - 16:28)
update brings cheap storage upgrades for (16:25 - 16:30)
all this is off (16:28 - 16:35)
of polygon.com but from February 16th (16:30 - 16:38)
through February 28th increasing in the (16:35 - 16:40)
amounts of storage players will have (16:38 - 16:43)
will cost 50% less fewer poke coins than (16:40 - 16:46)
usual the upgrade that makes the upgrade (16:43 - 16:49)
100 poke coins instead of 200 pokecoins (16:46 - 16:51)
for the Pokemon storage upgrade (16:49 - 16:53)
specifically each upgrade gives players (16:51 - 16:57)
50 more slots in their bag uh and they (16:53 - 17:01)
can increase that to a capacity a (16:57 - 17:04)
maximum capacity of a th000 Pokemon if (17:01 - 17:07)
you do that during this promotion (17:04 - 17:09)
that'll cost you about $15 to get Max (17:07 - 17:12)
storage I think all players start with (17:09 - 17:15)
250 and so for pretty much a dollar it (17:12 - 17:18)
lets you hold 50 extra Pokemon and so (17:15 - 17:20)
that's going on until the end of this (17:18 - 17:23)
month might be worth doing if you plan (17:20 - 17:25)
on playing Pokémon go a little longer I (17:23 - 17:27)
don't know if you need a Max of a (17:25 - 17:30)
thousand all right so let's talk about (17:27 - 17:33)
the money thing here they we already (17:30 - 17:35)
talked about how the Pokemon storage (17:33 - 17:39)
upgrade is uh 100 coins cheaper so at (17:35 - 17:41)
one point both the bag upgrade and the (17:39 - 17:43)
Pokemon storage upgrade were 200 coins (17:41 - 17:47)
like I said until February 28th the (17:43 - 17:50)
upgrade the storage is is half off that (17:47 - 17:54)
gives you 50 more Pokemon spots (17:50 - 17:59)
slots spot slots they added some more (17:54 - 18:01)
character customization under a tab (17:59 - 18:04)
called style and uh pretty much (18:01 - 18:08)
everything here costs money there is (18:04 - 18:10)
customizations that don't cost money and (18:08 - 18:13)
that is uh that is something like (18:10 - 18:14)
removing your hat you can now remove (18:13 - 18:17)
your hat your gloves your shoes people (18:14 - 18:19)
really excited that you can remove your (18:17 - 18:21)
shoes and be bare Barefoot but uh if you (18:19 - 18:23)
want a fancy Fedora that's going to cost (18:21 - 18:28)
180 pokecoins a top hat uh 800 Pokémon (18:23 - 18:32)
coins and a like a newspaper boy hat is (18:28 - 18:35)
100 Pokemon coins wait can I get a bow (18:32 - 18:36)
tie and a (18:35 - 18:38)
monacle I don't think so you can get (18:36 - 18:41)
like 3D glasses like one side red one (18:38 - 18:44)
side blue who needs a top hat if you (18:41 - 18:46)
can't pair it with a bow tie and a mon (18:44 - 18:49)
you can get like a like a Blazer uh but (18:46 - 18:51)
I want to remind people that 800 (18:49 - 18:53)
pokecoins is (18:51 - 18:56)
$8 and it's a top hat it's a top hat (18:53 - 18:58)
yeah underglass look if you want to talk (18:56 - 19:00)
about about egregious microtransactions (18:58 - 19:03)
let's talk about Fire Emblem Heroes like (19:00 - 19:06)
this is not new in terms of no no (19:03 - 19:08)
Nintendo's pricing for well and I (19:06 - 19:11)
suppose it's probably Niantic nean I (19:08 - 19:12)
don't know if that call would be Niantic (19:11 - 19:15)
or the Pokemon companies it's probably a (19:12 - 19:18)
collaborative thing but regardless it is (19:15 - 19:20)
not new for Nintendo mobile properties (19:18 - 19:23)
to have egregiously priced mic it's not (19:20 - 19:26)
new for any mobile game to have (19:23 - 19:28)
microtransactions and these are only (19:26 - 19:29)
cosmetics it's not like putting a top (19:28 - 19:31)
hat on is going to increase your your (19:29 - 19:33)
catch ratio it's not like a Pay to Win (19:31 - 19:37)
here but to go from having one hat be a (19:33 - 19:40)
dollar and another hat being $8 like (19:37 - 19:43)
that that's a big difference uh they so (19:40 - 19:46)
in in the they have glasses that you can (19:43 - 19:48)
get a pair of glasses for 50 coins and (19:46 - 19:52)
you can get uh the 3D goggles (19:48 - 19:54)
for 160 coins and then you can get like (19:52 - 19:57)
a phantom of the hour Batman Robin SL (19:54 - 20:00)
mask more I guess more Robin than Batman (19:57 - 20:04)
for $4 this is what really kind of grabs (20:00 - 20:06)
like kind of irritates me so I bought a (20:04 - 20:09)
hoodie for my (20:06 - 20:11)
character and I don't know how much it (20:09 - 20:14)
was I think it was it was it was $2.20 (20:11 - 20:15)
yeah I'm looking at it right now so when (20:14 - 20:17)
you go into the hoodie options you have (20:15 - 20:19)
a bunch of colors like a red one a blue (20:17 - 20:21)
one a gray one a yellow one and a black (20:19 - 20:23)
one so when you buy one of those hoodies (20:21 - 20:25)
and maybe no one has bought this yet so (20:23 - 20:27)
this is just kind of like a a a public (20:25 - 20:29)
service announcement when you buy a (20:27 - 20:32)
specific color of a hoodie you are only (20:29 - 20:34)
getting that color so even though you (20:32 - 20:35)
bought that hoodie you only bought that (20:34 - 20:38)
hoodie in that color so if you wanted (20:35 - 20:40)
all five colors of that hoodie that's (20:38 - 20:42)
you know over $10 cuz each of these are (20:40 - 20:45)
220 coins well you know that's how it (20:42 - 20:46)
works in real stores (20:45 - 20:48)
too you know you don't go into the Gap (20:46 - 20:50)
and buy like the blue hoodie and they're (20:48 - 20:52)
like okay here's the red one the red one (20:50 - 20:54)
and the great one well I don't know what (20:52 - 20:56)
stores you're sh do that they don't even (20:54 - 20:59)
do that at Old Navy as far as I know (20:56 - 21:01)
also I just want to I just want to go on (20:59 - 21:03)
record of complaining about the men's (21:01 - 21:05)
socks because they're not socks they're (21:03 - 21:10)
like shinguards and I have these weird (21:05 - 21:13)
jeans that I paid like A180 for because (21:10 - 21:14)
I wanted my characters to be in jeans in (21:13 - 21:17)
a hoodie and when I turn on and off the (21:14 - 21:19)
socks I don't see the socks because (21:17 - 21:20)
they're not socks they're like Shinu (21:19 - 21:22)
guards and it's really annoying I want (21:20 - 21:23)
my characters that have socks because I (21:22 - 21:25)
don't want to see my ankles cuz I don't (21:23 - 21:27)
want anyone seeing my ankles the ankles (21:25 - 21:29)
are for me only to see (21:27 - 21:31)
I'm I'm very confused by this is there (21:29 - 21:33)
what what when you have the socks on (21:31 - 21:35)
what do you see in the gap between the (21:33 - 21:37)
bottom of the pant and the top of the (21:35 - 21:40)
shoe nothing nothing like I have the (21:37 - 21:43)
pants on if I turn socks off or on (21:40 - 21:45)
nothing changes because my pants are too (21:43 - 21:47)
long because your character originally (21:45 - 21:50)
starts with those like running cargo (21:47 - 21:52)
pants which only go like below the knees (21:50 - 21:55)
and then the the quote unquote socks are (21:52 - 21:57)
like shinguards which cover like the (21:55 - 22:00)
bottom of the the the starting shorts to (21:57 - 22:02)
like your ankles but they don't cover (22:00 - 22:03)
your ankles yeah they're they're not (22:02 - 22:06)
shin guards they're they're socks (22:03 - 22:08)
they're just no cuz socks cover your (22:06 - 22:11)
feet and these socks don't cover your (22:08 - 22:13)
feet at all they just cover a portion of (22:11 - 22:15)
your lower leg well then they're just (22:13 - 22:18)
leg tubes I guess (22:15 - 22:21)
yeah it's why is that funny it's really (22:18 - 22:23)
frustrating guys this is I just want a (22:21 - 22:27)
pair of socks the phrase leg tube might (22:23 - 22:29)
be (22:27 - 22:31)
I think we might have defeated the (22:29 - 22:34)
English language I think we won well (22:31 - 22:38)
technically the actual word is uh leg (22:34 - 22:40)
warmers remember leg warmers back in the (22:38 - 22:42)
80s we used to wear them when we danced (22:40 - 22:45)
yeah intellectually those are but I do (22:42 - 22:48)
not remember them alive that leg warmers (22:45 - 22:51)
are not socks right leg warmers don't go (22:48 - 22:53)
around your feet they just go on your (22:51 - 22:55)
leg Yeah leg warmers are socks where the (22:53 - 22:57)
feet have been cut off yeah that's what (22:55 - 22:59)
that's what the men's options are here (22:57 - 23:02)
they're leg tubes I need things I need (22:59 - 23:05)
something to cover my feet and my ankles (23:02 - 23:06)
and right now I'm not getting that (23:05 - 23:09)
option also the options for the female (23:06 - 23:11)
character way better they have way (23:09 - 23:13)
better pants they have an option for a (23:11 - 23:16)
belt that the men don't have they (23:13 - 23:18)
actually have real socks they don't have (23:16 - 23:20)
these these these tube these tube (23:18 - 23:23)
warmers around their legs I'm very (23:20 - 23:25)
frustrated by this I mean that's a (23:23 - 23:27)
reflection of our general society that (23:25 - 23:28)
is still (23:27 - 23:32)
heavily gendered in fashion and apparel (23:28 - 23:34)
that women have a wider selection of (23:32 - 23:36)
things to choose from we don't even get (23:34 - 23:38)
sockes men all I want is a pair of socks (23:36 - 23:41)
white I'll take white I'll take black (23:38 - 23:45)
I'll I'll pay a up to 200 poke coins for (23:41 - 23:46)
a good pair of socks that's all I'm (23:45 - 23:48)
saying you're going to pay (23:46 - 23:53)
$10 200 poke coins no 200 pokecoins is (23:48 - 23:59)
like2 oh okay H yeah sure whatever (23:53 - 24:00)
so so my question is can I have (23:59 - 24:03)
everything off (24:00 - 24:07)
mostly no you can have I think you have (24:03 - 24:08)
to have a shirt and you have to have (24:07 - 24:10)
pants I think everything else you could (24:08 - 24:13)
take off all right all right I can work (24:10 - 24:16)
with that all right there's also like a (24:13 - 24:19)
shirt that you can buy I think it's $5 (24:16 - 24:21)
but you can only buy the shirt if you're (24:19 - 24:23)
level 30 which I think is kind of cool (24:21 - 24:25)
in concept of like okay this shirt's (24:23 - 24:26)
exclusive to people who put in the (24:25 - 24:28)
effort to get the 30 even though have to (24:26 - 24:30)
pay a little bit of money for it I think (24:28 - 24:32)
that I think that concept's cool but (24:30 - 24:33)
hopefully I don't know why I'm saying (24:32 - 24:36)
hopefully I I would suppose that now (24:33 - 24:39)
that there are clothes in the (24:36 - 24:42)
store and this is clearly a money pit (24:39 - 24:44)
for hardcore Pokémon go players I am (24:42 - 24:46)
sure that there will be more clothes (24:44 - 24:48)
coming but I I'm very excited to play (24:46 - 24:50)
Pokémon go again it was it was as much (24:48 - 24:54)
as I was like oh okay nothing but spin a (24:50 - 24:55)
rack around me great this is the new (24:54 - 24:57)
Weedle it is awesome to see like when I (24:55 - 24:59)
discovered whooper I was like ah Whooper (24:57 - 25:00)
and then it reminded me of Whooper and (24:59 - 25:03)
slack so there there is that little bit (25:00 - 25:06)
of excitement again that that that I (25:03 - 25:09)
felt transitioning to our last Pokémon (25:06 - 25:12)
go story this is this is something I've (25:09 - 25:13)
been following because I live in (25:12 - 25:17)
Milwaukee and while this is Milwaukee (25:13 - 25:19)
specific I guess I've I've talked about (25:17 - 25:22)
the the park problem in Milwaukee enough (25:19 - 25:25)
that that we we are just going to (25:22 - 25:27)
continue this roller coaster ride so (25:25 - 25:29)
this was public on February 2nd by (25:27 - 25:30)
milwauke (25:29 - 25:32)
record.com uh titled Pokémon go and (25:30 - 25:35)
Pokémon go like games will have to apply (25:32 - 25:38)
for permits in Milwaukee County Parks (25:35 - 25:40)
Milwaukee is still talking about Pokémon (25:38 - 25:43)
go and still trying to make it and other (25:40 - 25:46)
games pay for permits take up virtual (25:43 - 25:48)
space in Milwaukee County Parks scratch (25:46 - 25:50)
that last part because Milwaukee has (25:48 - 25:53)
actually succeeded at this Thursday in a (25:50 - 25:55)
Milwaukee County Board of Supervisors (25:53 - 25:57)
meeting an ordinance was formally (25:55 - 25:59)
adopted required reiring all virtual and (25:57 - 26:02)
location-based augmented reality games (25:59 - 26:05)
to apply for permits to do virtual (26:02 - 26:07)
business in Milwaukee County Parks the (26:05 - 26:10)
ordinance was directly inspired by last (26:07 - 26:13)
Summer's Pokémon go/ Lake Park (26:10 - 26:15)
controversy which saw thousands of (26:13 - 26:18)
people flocking and causing damage to (26:15 - 26:20)
the east side park uh this is the park (26:18 - 26:22)
where all the rich people live off of (26:20 - 26:24)
which I've mentioned before yeah yeah (26:22 - 26:26)
during the meeting ordinance sponsor (26:24 - 26:29)
supervisor Shel and werman once again (26:26 - 26:31)
noted that the ordinance was not aimed (26:29 - 26:33)
at Pokémon go players rather it was (26:31 - 26:35)
intended to establish a permitted (26:33 - 26:39)
process for virtual games similar to (26:35 - 26:41)
those permitting processes for (26:39 - 26:43)
non-virtual companies doing business in (26:41 - 26:45)
Milwaukee County Parks this has nothing (26:43 - 26:47)
to do with Pokemon players absolutely (26:45 - 26:50)
not waserman said after warning that a (26:47 - 26:52)
new wave of Pokémon go like games were (26:50 - 26:54)
on the horizon I would like to (26:52 - 26:56)
personally I I'm I'm curious what games (26:54 - 26:58)
he thinks are on the horizon uh and it (26:56 - 27:02)
will be at your Park tomorrow later (26:58 - 27:05)
ordinance co-sponsor supervisor David (27:02 - 27:07)
Satori or something talked about used (27:05 - 27:09)
tampons and infant diapers filled with (27:07 - 27:12)
feal matter uh which is the reason why (27:09 - 27:15)
this ordinance is in (27:12 - 27:15)
place (27:18 - 27:24)
the the two things I assoc kidding those (27:20 - 27:30)
those were associate with Pokemon go (27:24 - 27:30)
you know they said it's not not aimed at (27:30 - 27:35)
Pokemon go players but we really need to (27:33 - 27:37)
solve the garbage problem in the (27:35 - 27:40)
specific two items I named that are that (27:37 - 27:42)
are everywhere in in Milwaukee County (27:40 - 27:44)
Parks the ordinance reads as follow (27:42 - 27:47)
virtual and location-based augmented (27:44 - 27:49)
reality games are not permitted in (27:47 - 27:51)
Milwaukee County Parks except in those (27:49 - 27:54)
areas designated with a permit for such (27:51 - 27:56)
by director of Departments of parks (27:54 - 27:59)

required before any company May (27:59 - 28:04)

events and activities within the parks (28:44 - 28:48)
outside of the standard operational (28:46 - 28:50)
hours the ordinance was originally (28:48 - 28:52)
recommended to the company board back in (28:50 - 28:54)
December it was referred back to the (28:52 - 28:56)
parks committee weeks later and then (28:54 - 28:58)
recommended to the Country Board again (28:56 - 29:00)

discussed just a little bit one more (29:09 - 29:13)
paragraph here a pokeemon a poke (29:11 - 29:16)
controversy was touched off last summer (29:13 - 29:18)
when it was revealed that Milwaukee (29:16 - 29:20)
County Parks had written a letter to (29:18 - 29:23)
developer of Pokemon go Niantic Inc (29:20 - 29:25)
asking for the removal of Poké star (29:23 - 29:27)
stops from Lake Park the park has become (29:25 - 29:29)
huge popular for the destination of (29:27 - 29:31)
Pokémon go players much to the charging (29:29 - 29:34)
and sometimes outright Hospitality of (29:31 - 29:36)
our neighbors trash parking issues lack (29:34 - 29:38)
of bathrooms I'll agree with that there (29:36 - 29:39)
was no bathrooms there's like one (29:38 - 29:41)
bathroom trampling Landscapes and (29:39 - 29:44)
neighbors threatened with violence were (29:41 - 29:46)
just a few problems that arose the (29:44 - 29:49)
controversy came to a head in September (29:46 - 29:52)
in a boring livid and glorious observe (29:49 - 29:55)
absurd meeting that founded that found (29:52 - 29:58)
both sides of the issue at wit's and in (29:55 - 30:00)
October a handful of Lake Park Poké (29:58 - 30:03)
stops were removed by NE antic as of (30:00 - 30:06)
time of press pokeo Pokémon go players (30:03 - 30:08)
in Lake Parks could not be reached for (30:06 - 30:10)
comment because the whole thing more or (30:08 - 30:12)
less died out 5 months ago so there you (30:10 - 30:13)
go I don't think the news article said (30:12 - 30:15)
more or less died out five months ago I (30:13 - 30:17)
think that was some Steve black Jr (30:15 - 30:20)
editorial comment no that that was at (30:17 - 30:21)
the time of press Pokemon go players in (30:20 - 30:23)
the L couldn't be reached for comments (30:21 - 30:24)
because the whole thing more or less (30:23 - 30:26)
died out five months ago that was their (30:24 - 30:28)
last so this is like a sassy paper not a (30:26 - 30:31)
just report the news kind of paper uh (30:28 - 30:34)
yeah I would say Milwaukee records is uh (30:31 - 30:36)
you know they're not you know point to (30:34 - 30:40)
point but I what does that mean point to (30:36 - 30:42)
point well you know he means like they (30:40 - 30:45)
just like report the facts with no yeah (30:42 - 30:46)
commentary yeah this is clearly this (30:45 - 30:49)
clearly had commentary right yeah which (30:46 - 30:51)
is I mean much to my (30:49 - 30:53)
shagin but but this is what we talked (30:51 - 30:55)
about months ago when I when I (30:53 - 30:57)
originally brought this up that there (30:55 - 31:00)
was this problem and and I am sure other (30:57 - 31:03)
Parks may have had this issue I live in (31:00 - 31:05)
Milwaukee so uh very easy for me to come (31:03 - 31:08)
across this news uh Milwaukee might be (31:05 - 31:11)
one of the the bigger stories out of all (31:08 - 31:12)
the other cities because Milwaukee is a (31:11 - 31:14)
pretty big city in itself compared to (31:12 - 31:17)
other cities but really the the the (31:14 - 31:20)
argument at the time was yeah this game (31:17 - 31:23)
just launched it's really busy but hey (31:20 - 31:25)
winter is coming uh that's not a Game of (31:23 - 31:27)
Thrones reference winter is coming the (31:25 - 31:29)
the hype for this game is going to die (31:27 - 31:31)
down why are we spending so much effort (31:29 - 31:33)
trying to remove the game when naturally (31:31 - 31:35)
that is what's going to happen in a (31:33 - 31:37)
couple months and that's what did like (31:35 - 31:39)
I'm sure Lake Park was probably pretty (31:37 - 31:41)
busy today but I haven't been down there (31:39 - 31:43)
so I don't know what Poké stops are (31:41 - 31:45)
still there would have been removed if (31:43 - 31:48)
all of them have been removed I know my (31:45 - 31:51)
sister who was not into Pokemon at all (31:48 - 31:53)
who found this huge Addiction in Pokémon (31:51 - 31:56)
go she has played every single day since (31:53 - 31:58)
the game has been released (31:56 - 32:00)
she has two really young kids one one (31:58 - 32:03)
three year one 3 years old one 8 months (32:00 - 32:05)
old and and she takes them for walks all (32:03 - 32:07)
the time and she goes down to wakasa (32:05 - 32:10)
park wakesha being a a city outside (32:07 - 32:12)
Milwaukee and and you know hits up all (32:10 - 32:13)
the Poké stops there and plays Pokémon (32:12 - 32:16)
go every single day she can even in the (32:13 - 32:18)
winter she was going out and and doing (32:16 - 32:22)
that and so clearly other Parks don't (32:18 - 32:24)
have a problem with this I just can't (32:22 - 32:26)
believe that it's gotten to this point (32:24 - 32:28)
with Milwaukee (32:26 - 32:30)
I'd be curious if other cities or other (32:28 - 32:32)
listeners have had issues with their (32:30 - 32:35)
Parks yeah I I have never heard of this (32:32 - 32:37)
at all and I'm wondering if like the (32:35 - 32:40)
Milwaukee C you have you have heard of (32:37 - 32:42)
this because you are on some of the (32:40 - 32:45)
episodes no no no I have heard of this (32:42 - 32:48)
in Milwaukee I have not heard of this in (32:45 - 32:51)
like the rest of the nation to such an (32:48 - 32:54)
extreme at this point in time and I I'm (32:51 - 32:57)
just like I'm wondering if the Milwaukee (32:54 - 32:59)
city government government just like (32:57 - 33:02)
doesn't want people to visit their Parks (32:59 - 33:04)
anymore it just like what is it about (33:02 - 33:07)
Milwaukee people that just kind of stink (33:04 - 33:08)
well but I mean it's like doesn't it (33:07 - 33:11)
seem like the the antithesis of your (33:08 - 33:14)
expectation for a a city ordinance they (33:11 - 33:16)
should be like we want to promote people (33:14 - 33:18)
visiting our beautiful natural parks and (33:16 - 33:21)
instead they're like we would prefer (33:18 - 33:24)
that people with their basic human needs (33:21 - 33:27)
please remain out of our parks and only (33:24 - 33:29)
those people who live in self-contained (33:27 - 33:32)
bubbles may visit without influencing or (33:29 - 33:34)
impacting any of the surroundings thank (33:32 - 33:38)
you is that what it is is it that all of (33:34 - 33:42)
a sudden this park that was is it like a (33:38 - 33:45)
classism thing is it like uh that's (33:42 - 33:47)
really what it sounds like yeah all of (33:45 - 33:49)
us all of us rich people we had this (33:47 - 33:52)
Lake Park thing to ourselves because but (33:49 - 33:55)
then when Pokémon go kind of let the (33:52 - 33:58)
sort of let out the secret of of this (33:55 - 34:01)
park it's like well I can't be having (33:58 - 34:02)
all of (34:01 - 34:05)
these all of (34:02 - 34:05)
these all of these pooy in my ex exactly (34:06 - 34:13)
because they're if they were in the need (34:10 - 34:17)
of a uh feminine sanitary object they (34:13 - 34:19)
would stay home they wouldn't go to the (34:17 - 34:22)
park on such days and all of their (34:19 - 34:25)
diapers are filled with only the finest (34:22 - 34:29)
of perer not with yeah and they're cloth (34:25 - 34:29)
yeah no I I I absolutely think it's (34:29 - 34:35)
because of the the people who lived (34:32 - 34:37)
across the street of Lake Park I mean (34:35 - 34:41)
going through the the issues they listed (34:37 - 34:44)
which is trash parking issues lack of (34:41 - 34:45)
bathrooms trampled landscape and (34:44 - 34:47)
neighbors threatened with violence I (34:45 - 34:50)
mean you you break those down and there (34:47 - 34:52)
were more than enough trash cans at Lake (34:50 - 34:54)
Park and this is this is coming from me (34:52 - 34:56)
who's been to Lake Park a handful of (34:54 - 34:59)
times uh when it when Pokémon go was at (34:56 - 35:02)
its busy busiest I rarely saw trash on (34:59 - 35:05)
the ground i' I did see one or two (35:02 - 35:07)
people throw their trash on the ground (35:05 - 35:10)
and you know what a couple seconds SL (35:07 - 35:11)
minutes later somebody else just picked (35:10 - 35:14)
that trash up and threw it away there (35:11 - 35:17)
was a lot of there were a lot of civil (35:14 - 35:20)
people around doing the right thing and (35:17 - 35:24)
and whether this is you know a sporting (35:20 - 35:29)
event or a a movie theater or or a (35:24 - 35:32)
digital game in a public park you're (35:29 - 35:34)
always going to have people who litter (35:32 - 35:38)
right that's not exclusive to a park (35:34 - 35:41)
situation going like parking issues yeah (35:38 - 35:43)
there were parking issues there but (35:41 - 35:46)
Milwaukee has street parking and so (35:43 - 35:46)
that's what a lot of people did with (35:46 - 35:48)
street parking there was a parking lot (35:46 - 35:51)
for Lake Park that did get filled (35:48 - 35:52)
instantly because that's where you were (35:51 - 35:54)
supposed to park for the park so instead (35:52 - 35:58)
people parked on the street and that was (35:54 - 35:59)
that wasn't illegal to park on the (35:58 - 36:03)
street uh but the streets were normally (35:59 - 36:07)
not filled with cars up and down lack of (36:03 - 36:08)
bathrooms yeah completely agree with (36:07 - 36:10)
there was only one public bathroom (36:08 - 36:12)
nearby that bathroom closed at 8 the (36:10 - 36:15)
parks open till 10 I don't know when the (36:12 - 36:18)
bathroom opened but very (36:15 - 36:21)
broad problems that they just kind of uh (36:18 - 36:24)
umbrellaed under Pokémon go to use (36:21 - 36:28)
against its case I do find the question (36:24 - 36:32)
who owns the digital Spa who has (36:28 - 36:36)
authority over the digital space in a (36:32 - 36:38)
city I do find that to be an interesting (36:36 - 36:40)
philosophical question I I guess I would (36:38 - 36:42)
have to find out if the Poké stops are (36:40 - 36:44)
there still there how many are there or (36:42 - 36:46)
or whatnot but okay so this law now (36:44 - 36:49)
exists in Milwaukee County Parks but (36:46 - 36:50)
what happens if NE antic doesn't follow (36:49 - 36:53)
it like poke like Milwaukee can't remove (36:50 - 36:55)
the stops themselves right that has to (36:53 - 36:57)
be NE antic that removes it right yeah (36:55 - 36:58)
but they pass this ordinance and then (36:57 - 37:00)
they sue them when they come across the (36:58 - 37:02)
Poké stop is still sitting there and (37:00 - 37:04)
then it goes to a court and they say no (37:02 - 37:06)
Milwaukee you're being ridiculous go (37:04 - 37:09)
away yeah I'm sure Niantic already knows (37:06 - 37:12)
that this happened and they will (37:09 - 37:15)
probably just remove the stops or legal (37:12 - 37:18)
reasons like will said so we'll see I (37:15 - 37:19)
just thought it was interesting (37:18 - 37:21)
especially now that Pokemon go is kind (37:19 - 37:23)
of picked up some more momentum again uh (37:21 - 37:25)
interesting to see what happens with (37:23 - 37:26)
that (37:25 - 37:29)
situation uh final bit of news here not (37:26 - 37:30)
probably not much to talk about Pokemon (37:29 - 37:32)
Sun and Moon latest giveaway is kind of (37:30 - 37:36)
a bust this article also off polygon.com (37:32 - 37:38)
uh Pokemon trainers can swing by (37:36 - 37:40)
GameStop from now until March 5th to (37:38 - 37:42)
pick up a special item from Pokemon Sun (37:40 - 37:46)
and Moon a single silver bottle cap but (37:42 - 37:47)
those already deep in the metag game (37:46 - 37:50)
likely have figured out enough of these (37:47 - 37:52)
to spare making this one of the most (37:50 - 37:55)
disappointing giveaways in some time um (37:52 - 37:57)
they explain what a bottle cap is is (37:55 - 37:59)
what it does blah blah blah any thoughts (37:57 - 38:04)
on this so what how okay I know that (37:59 - 38:06)
bottle caps are used to raise (38:04 - 38:10)
IVs but like how does that work I (38:06 - 38:13)
haven't done that yet you I mean I've (38:10 - 38:15)
caught I think I've caught a bottle cap (38:13 - 38:18)
when I was fishing one time but yeah I (38:15 - 38:21)
haven't used one right so the so you you (38:18 - 38:27)
use them in the mall I think yeah (38:21 - 38:28)
there's a guy there's a booth at the (38:27 - 38:31)
mall the thing about the silver one (38:28 - 38:34)
that's not or that just or I think it's (38:31 - 38:36)
just called bottle cap it it doesn't (38:34 - 38:38)
isn't specifically labeled as a silver (38:36 - 38:40)
one I don't think but like the gold (38:38 - 38:42)
bottle cap is what they're comparing it (38:40 - 38:46)
against um typical bottle cap will (38:42 - 38:51)
maximize IV of one (38:46 - 38:54)
Pokemon's one stat of one (38:51 - 38:59)
Pokemon whereas gold B B cap will (38:54 - 39:02)
maximize all of a (38:59 - 39:05)
Pokemon's IVs does that make sense okay (39:02 - 39:09)
yeah distinction yeah there you have it (39:05 - 39:11)
so a silver bottle cap is more useful if (39:09 - 39:14)
I want to have like a zero Speed IV and (39:11 - 39:15)
all the other (39:14 - 39:20)
ones maxed out yeah yeah I think the the (39:15 - 39:24)
the commentary here though is who it (39:20 - 39:27)
doesn't seem worth taking a out to (39:24 - 39:31)
GameStop to get one single bottle cap (39:27 - 39:33)
right so well that's why you have (39:31 - 39:34)
somebody do it for (39:33 - 39:36)
you do they just give you a code do you (39:34 - 39:39)
just enter a code to grab the bottle cap (39:36 - 39:41)
yeah they're code cards okay well like (39:39 - 39:46)
why is it not 10 or five or one gold one (39:41 - 39:49)
and five silver one like it just seems (39:46 - 39:52)
really (39:49 - 39:55)
disappointing yeah it's free but still I (39:52 - 39:57)
guess I should have known this already (39:55 - 39:58)
but I was just looking up more (39:57 - 40:01)
information about hyper training the (39:58 - 40:04)
process of using those bottle caps in (40:01 - 40:08)
the mall uh to increase your IVs and I (40:04 - 40:09)
learned something that I think I had (40:08 - 40:11)
heard before but I already forgot but (40:09 - 40:15)
that's kind of cool just fun fact that (40:11 - 40:18)
uh game doesn't actually change like if (40:15 - 40:21)
you're looking under the hood so to (40:18 - 40:24)
speak the actual IV value of a Pokemon (40:21 - 40:28)
isn't changed when you undergo hypert (40:24 - 40:31)
trining instead according to Bulbapedia (40:28 - 40:34)
hypert trining sets a modifier so that (40:31 - 40:36)
the game treats that stat as if it were (40:34 - 40:40)
a 31 but keeps the original value saved (40:36 - 40:43)
just adds that modifier to say hey (40:40 - 40:46)
Pretend This is a 31 so because of that (40:43 - 40:50)
you can have whatever hidden power you (40:46 - 40:54)
want and still have Max IVs which you (40:50 - 40:56)
couldn't before because hidden Powers (40:54 - 40:59)
type is determined by a Pokemon's (40:56 - 41:02)
IVs but because this doesn't actually (40:59 - 41:05)
change the hard numbers it just adds the (41:02 - 41:07)
modifier you can actually have whatever (41:05 - 41:10)
hidden power you want and still have a (41:07 - 41:13)
Pokemon that's competitively optimal so (41:10 - 41:15)
that's kind of cool and it also means (41:13 - 41:17)
that the bottle caps can't change the (41:15 - 41:19)
hidden power isn't that what I said yeah (41:17 - 41:21)
I just said it the other way yeah yeah (41:19 - 41:23)
right yeah well just at the opposite of (41:21 - 41:24)
you like no because like right some (41:23 - 41:29)
people might try to say oh I my TPU has (41:24 - 41:31)
the wrong hidden power I'm going to use (41:29 - 41:33)
bottle caps to adjust so I get the (41:31 - 41:35)
right whatever it's hidden power it's (41:33 - 41:39)
born with is what it stays with uh I do (41:35 - 41:40)
la last thing is I do want to say that (41:39 - 41:44)
Will was right uh last week when where's (41:40 - 41:46)
the trumpet where's the trumpet hold on (41:44 - 41:49)
hold on hold on hold (41:46 - 41:53)
on oh that's terrible oh hold on cut cut (41:49 - 41:55)
that out (41:53 - 41:59)
please h oh God hold (41:55 - 41:59)
on I can't see I don't actually have my (42:00 - 42:05)
real trumpet right here because I was (42:03 - 42:07)
caught off (42:05 - 42:10)
guard so instead what I instead what I (42:07 - 42:12)
have is my pocket trumpet which has the (42:10 - 42:16)
same range as a trumpet but it's very (42:12 - 42:18)
trumpet but it's very very tiny and it's (42:16 - 42:21)
also much more difficult to play because (42:18 - 42:23)
the thing about the regular siiz trumpet (42:21 - 42:26)
is that it provides a lot less pressure (42:23 - 42:28)
back to you when you're trying to play (42:26 - 42:30)
the pocket trumpet because it's all (42:28 - 42:33)
compact it it it's it's has a lot of (42:30 - 42:35)
like sort of feedback pressure I guess (42:33 - 42:37)
it's difficult to play against and I (42:35 - 42:39)
wasn't warmed up you dropped the ball (42:37 - 42:43)
Travis uh what will was right about was (42:39 - 42:46)
the what is it the GTS contest the yeah (42:43 - 42:49)
the the global the Global Link trade (42:46 - 42:53)
system contest all I did was went I went (42:49 - 42:57)
to the the the receptionists I signed up (42:53 - 42:59)
I didn't do anything the next day I got (42:57 - 43:03)
my 4,000 Festival coins there you go I (42:59 - 43:05)
didn't have to participate I just had to (43:03 - 43:08)
sign up so I got my 4,000 coins I don't (43:05 - 43:10)
know what I'm going to do with those yet (43:08 - 43:13)
I guess I'll figure that out but uh look (43:10 - 43:15)
at me playing Pokemon Sun and (43:13 - 43:19)
Moon Welcome To Life as a millennial yep (43:15 - 43:20)
uh with that being said we're going to (43:19 - 43:23)
take a break when we come back we're (43:20 - 43:25)
going to have our interview with (43:23 - 43:27)
Christine she's going to tell us how to (43:25 - 43:29)
make how she makes custom amiibos how (43:27 - 43:32)
she slices and dices up some Pikachus (43:29 - 43:36)
and uh how she how she does art so we'll (43:32 - 43:37)
be right back and then after that we'll (43:36 - 43:38)
come back with some emails and our (43:37 - 43:42)
Pokémon of the (43:38 - 43:44)

amiibo because you know everyone loves (45:00 - 45:07)
amiibo so um I customize them paint them (45:03 - 45:11)

yeah I uh I don't know how I discovered (45:11 - 45:16)
you I I I've known of for you for a (45:13 - 45:18)
while and it was really funny because (45:16 - 45:20)
somebody retweeted you and I was like oh (45:18 - 45:23)
my gosh I I'm not even following you no (45:20 - 45:25)
problem and so I followed you on Twitter (45:23 - 45:27)
and then we start started talking and I (45:25 - 45:28)
was like hey you you should come on the (45:27 - 45:30)
show I think you I think you do some (45:28 - 45:33)
really interesting and creative stuff oh (45:30 - 45:35)
thank you I'm honored I'm completely (45:33 - 45:36)
honored like anyone who reaches out to (45:35 - 45:40)
me because I am just a girl painting in (45:36 - 45:43)
my room so that's the best way I look at (45:40 - 45:45)
it so it's cool when people want to know (45:43 - 45:48)
about customizing or just in general (45:45 - 45:51)
about the things that I do so well well (45:48 - 45:52)
you say you're you're just a girl (45:51 - 45:54)
painting in your room but you have you (45:52 - 45:56)
have over like 20,000 follow followers (45:54 - 45:58)
on Twitter you have this storefront (45:56 - 46:00)
where you're selling amiibos like you (45:58 - 46:03)
you are pretty you're not just a girl (46:00 - 46:05)
like people know you uh you know what I (46:03 - 46:08)
don't know I for some odd reason I I (46:05 - 46:11)
don't really see myself as someone that (46:08 - 46:14)
people you know look up to or become (46:11 - 46:17)
inspired by I mean I I it's an honor to (46:14 - 46:19)
be honest and if anything that's what I (46:17 - 46:21)
want my art to do so it's it's really (46:19 - 46:24)
cool when people um come up to me and (46:21 - 46:26)
they say they like my art and it's funny (46:24 - 46:28)
cuz I honestly like if they freak out (46:26 - 46:31)
like I freak out and then I hug them so (46:28 - 46:34)
um I just see myself as a normal person (46:31 - 46:37)
doing pretty much what I love so all (46:34 - 46:39)
right all right well let's let's talk (46:37 - 46:43)
about what you love which is well I (46:39 - 46:45)
assume you love which is making custom (46:43 - 46:47)
amiibos right is that is that safe to (46:45 - 46:50)
say that that's kind of your main art (46:47 - 46:52)
thing at Art gig at this at this point (46:50 - 46:55)
in time is the amiibo stuff uh yes it's (46:52 - 46:57)
definitely the amiibos um before that it (46:55 - 47:00)
was ball tops for fight sticks and then (46:57 - 47:03)
before that it was like charms of video (47:00 - 47:05)
games and stuff like that so amiibo (47:03 - 47:08)
really like took off and and that's what (47:05 - 47:11)
I've been doing for a really long time (47:08 - 47:16)
so but I love it so what what Drew you (47:11 - 47:18)
to so far our listeners who haven't (47:16 - 47:22)
haven't seen Christine's art she has (47:18 - 47:24)
recently at least from what I've (47:22 - 47:26)
gathered you have a lot of mimic or (47:24 - 47:29)
Pokémon or mimikyu that may look like (47:26 - 47:31)
other Pokémon I would say is the the (47:29 - 47:34)
right way to say that in amiibo form so (47:31 - 47:37)
they are all custom but at the the the (47:34 - 47:39)
thing that STS the same as the base of (47:37 - 47:40)
the amiibo which I have questions about (47:39 - 47:45)
but mm you I've seen Super Mario Gala (47:40 - 47:48)
not Galaxy uh Odyssey amiibos that (47:45 - 47:52)
you've done I've seen some ash amiibos a (47:48 - 47:53)
ton of different Pokemon amiibos I think (47:52 - 47:56)
I think you had an alolan Marowak that (47:53 - 48:00)
was on your store yeah yeah so a ton of (47:56 - 48:02)
stuff so my question my first question (48:00 - 48:06)
is how why am EO like what made you was (48:02 - 48:08)
there inspiration did you see another (48:06 - 48:11)
artist do it was that just something (48:08 - 48:13)
that you bought and then decided to (48:11 - 48:16)
customize like why amiibo well um (48:13 - 48:19)
amazingly uh and I I love telling this (48:16 - 48:21)
story because uh I think it's hopefully (48:19 - 48:24)
people can connect with it um but it's (48:21 - 48:27)
all started in high school um and I was (48:24 - 48:31)
this really shy quiet pimple-faced girl (48:27 - 48:35)
who had no friends so I guess one day my (48:31 - 48:37)
sister my older sister brought me to the (48:35 - 48:40)
uh video game club and that's where I (48:37 - 48:41)
met a lot of my friends who were into (48:40 - 48:44)
like the smash scene so Super Smash Bros (48:41 - 48:47)
melee at the time was uh the game that I (48:44 - 48:50)
first got introduced to like um the (48:47 - 48:53)
whole smash competitive scene so yeah I (48:50 - 48:56)
went to the video game club um I met a (48:53 - 48:59)
lot of my friends and then at the time I (48:56 - 49:02)
also took art so I actually Incorporated (48:59 - 49:05)
both of them so during you know the (49:02 - 49:07)
video game club I would actually make (49:05 - 49:09)
figurines for some of the (49:07 - 49:13)
competitors um and when amibo came out (49:09 - 49:14)
it was just really easy for me to (49:13 - 49:16)
integrate it um and it's a lot easier to (49:14 - 49:18)
do since I'm starting off with a Bas (49:16 - 49:22)
instead of Starting by scratch so um (49:18 - 49:25)
yeah I mean I was introduced you know to (49:22 - 49:27)
I guess the gaming scene through Super (49:25 - 49:29)
Smash Bros so when they did have the (49:27 - 49:33)
amiibo um I definitely wanted to try and (49:29 - 49:34)
see if I can customize them and I was (49:33 - 49:37)
always really inspired by like that (49:34 - 49:39)
table that you see in the game where it (49:37 - 49:41)
has all these figurines and trophies and (49:39 - 49:43)
stuff yeah so it was really cool to (49:41 - 49:46)
finally have like a something physical (49:43 - 49:49)
um and yeah I wish they did earlier but (49:46 - 49:52)
you know it's awesome to have them now (49:49 - 49:54)
do you remember your the first one (49:52 - 49:57)
you've C you customized was it was it a (49:54 - 49:59)
Pikachu was it a Mario like do you (49:57 - 50:03)
remember that um it was a Pikachu and uh (49:59 - 50:05)
it was crazy because I wasn't actually (50:03 - 50:09)
interested in getting any of the amiibo (50:05 - 50:13)
um my friend had actually G gave me one (50:09 - 50:14)
and uh it was a Pikachu and and he was (50:13 - 50:16)
just like here I figured that you might (50:14 - 50:20)
want it because I I M Pikachu um I was (50:16 - 50:22)
in like the melee scene for a really (50:20 - 50:24)
long time and and I guess my go-to (50:22 - 50:26)
character was Pikachu so it was cool to (50:24 - 50:29)
have him give me that and uh I made like (50:26 - 50:33)
a Pikachu flash crossover so that was (50:29 - 50:36)
like my first ever I guess customized (50:33 - 50:40)
amiibo but it's crazy because when I was (50:36 - 50:43)
taking like clay and and um Ceramics in (50:40 - 50:46)
high school I kind of I guess made the (50:43 - 50:48)
first amiibo that I didn't realize it (50:46 - 50:50)
would have became like an actual thing (50:48 - 50:53)
later down the road so um it was pretty (50:50 - 50:55)
cool with Bas and all except you know of (50:53 - 50:58)
course didn't scan cuz I'm not good with (50:55 - 51:00)
technology (50:58 - 51:03)
so but uh yeah Nintendo hired (51:00 - 51:07)
me from from first amiibo from flash (51:03 - 51:11)
Pikachu to to now what got that ball (51:07 - 51:13)
rolling was that something where a bunch (51:11 - 51:14)
of friends were like hey you should (51:13 - 51:17)
start selling these or people ask just (51:14 - 51:19)
coming maybe maybe people coming up and (51:17 - 51:22)
saying like hey I I would like a Batman (51:19 - 51:24)
Pikachu amiibo can you make that for me (51:22 - 51:26)
and because now you now you do like (51:24 - 51:29)
commissions and stuff I do um uh (51:26 - 51:31)
commissions right now are closed because (51:29 - 51:32)
there I have so many orders but I will (51:31 - 51:35)
take on like certain orders if it's like (51:32 - 51:38)
a Mimi Q it's so easy to make um but I (51:35 - 51:40)
mean yeah people just came up to me and (51:38 - 51:41)
they're just like hey can you make this (51:40 - 51:43)
or can you make that and at one point I (51:41 - 51:46)
was so swamped with so many orders so I (51:43 - 51:48)
realized you know I'm only one person so (51:46 - 51:52)
I got to take it slow but um yeah I've (51:48 - 51:54)
been you know asked to make so many (51:52 - 51:57)
things and and commission wise and stuff (51:54 - 52:00)
like that I think the one that probably (51:57 - 52:04)
put me on the map I would say is um an (52:00 - 52:06)
aada figurine that I did that I actually (52:04 - 52:08)
had donated and I didn't think it was (52:06 - 52:11)
going to get that much um I guess like (52:08 - 52:13)
attention um but then next thing you (52:11 - 52:17)
know like um it blew up and and it was (52:13 - 52:18)
it was cool I didn't know how to handle (52:17 - 52:19)
it actually so I kind of like (52:18 - 52:21)
disappeared for the day and then handled (52:19 - 52:25)
it like the next day so but it was cool (52:21 - 52:26)
it was really awes awesome what do you (52:25 - 52:29)
remember what blew that up so you was (52:26 - 52:31)
this after iada passed away that you (52:29 - 52:34)
made the amibo and donated it yes yeah (52:31 - 52:37)
it was it was literally that night so (52:34 - 52:40)
when we when we had gotten the news when (52:37 - 52:43)
I saw it on the on the Twitter feed um I (52:40 - 52:45)
was just like oh man I got to I got to (52:43 - 52:48)
make this amiibo and after making it um (52:45 - 52:51)
I then realized like I can't sell this (52:48 - 52:53)
like you know and and the reason why is (52:51 - 52:56)
because you see everyone's reaction (52:53 - 52:59)
towards his passing and he's done such (52:56 - 53:03)
an amazing job with Nintendo and he has (52:59 - 53:06)
such a big influence on many people and (53:03 - 53:08)
and it's cool to see how many lives he's (53:06 - 53:11)
touched around the world you know so I (53:08 - 53:14)
can only imagine being in his position (53:11 - 53:16)
being able to (53:14 - 53:19)
basically you know like affect so many (53:16 - 53:21)
people in a positive way so I didn't (53:19 - 53:24)
want to just make this to sell um I (53:21 - 53:26)
thought it'd be really cool if (53:24 - 53:28)
somehow even though he's not here (53:26 - 53:31)
anymore that he can still make an impact (53:28 - 53:34)
um and we raised money for St Jude and (53:31 - 53:36)
it was really awesome it was really (53:34 - 53:39)
really cool to see the feedback and and (53:36 - 53:42)
how many people really loved him as a (53:39 - 53:45)
person so it was really really really (53:42 - 53:47)
awesome yeah that's that's incredible (53:45 - 53:51)
what a good story wow uh to to back up a (53:47 - 53:53)
little bit I always I always get ahead (53:51 - 53:54)
of myself but to back up a little bit (53:53 - 53:57)
our before the smash scene before (53:54 - 53:59)
everything that was there uh a love of (53:57 - 54:01)
Pokemon established I know you said your (53:59 - 54:03)
first your first custom was the the (54:01 - 54:06)
Pikachu amiibo but were you were you (54:03 - 54:09)
kind of into Pokemon really into Pokemon (54:06 - 54:12)
Pikachu maybe just the I was heavily (54:09 - 54:16)
into Pokemon um me and my sisters like (54:12 - 54:19)
we were so into it um and when we were (54:16 - 54:22)
younger growing up my dad would buy (54:19 - 54:24)
Pokémon cards just to make sure that we (54:22 - 54:27)
would eat and finish all of our food so (54:24 - 54:29)
oh man um you know it was a really big (54:27 - 54:32)
influence and actually Pokemon is most (54:29 - 54:36)
likely the reason why I'm in art um you (54:32 - 54:38)
know when we were younger they didn't (54:36 - 54:41)
really have the figurines for Pokemon (54:38 - 54:45)
you know and uh I guess I remember (54:41 - 54:48)
looking at the poster of 150 Pokemon and (54:45 - 54:51)
these these images were so small but you (54:48 - 54:52)
know as a kid I was just so fascinated (54:51 - 54:54)
with it so I remember one day taking a (54:52 - 54:56)
piece of paper grabbing this poster (54:54 - 54:59)
which was probably bigger than me and um (54:56 - 55:03)
trying to draw Blastoise so Blastoise (54:59 - 55:08)
was my favorite Pokemon um and I spent a (55:03 - 55:10)
good like three or four hours really (55:08 - 55:12)
trying to make sure that I drew (55:10 - 55:15)
Blastoise accurately um and I would (55:12 - 55:16)
erase lines if it didn't look right and (55:15 - 55:19)
then start all over again so this whole (55:16 - 55:22)
process that whole process I guess gave (55:19 - 55:25)
me the practice I needed for me to draw (55:22 - 55:27)
and uh you know after drawing so many (55:25 - 55:29)
Pokémon my sisters would go ahead and (55:27 - 55:31)
cut out the Pokemon and then they would (55:29 - 55:34)
have you know like crazy epic battles (55:31 - 55:37)
and limbs would fly and rip off and then (55:34 - 55:39)
I have to redraw the Pokemon so um it (55:37 - 55:41)
definitely gave me a lot of practice and (55:39 - 55:44)
it introduced me to um to Art so it's (55:41 - 55:47)
Pokemon has been such a big influence in (55:44 - 55:52)
my life so is that is that why is that (55:47 - 55:54)
and this audio podcast so our listeners (55:52 - 55:56)
can't see but there's this really great (55:54 - 56:00)
picture on your on your Facebook of just (55:56 - 56:04)
all these Pikachu amiibos laying in pile (56:00 - 56:06)
but none of them have a (56:04 - 56:08)
base (56:06 - 56:11)
uhhuh um the reason why is (56:08 - 56:16)
because um I my best seller is Mimi Q (56:11 - 56:19)
everyone loves Mimi q and I definitely (56:16 - 56:21)
will do something with the Pikachu that (56:19 - 56:24)
I have extra but you know with mimik it (56:21 - 56:26)
when I make mimiku that's actually (56:24 - 56:29)
starting from scratch so I can't really (56:26 - 56:32)
utilize Pikachu so much and and I'm a (56:29 - 56:35)
big you know advocator for using as much (56:32 - 56:39)
of the amiibo but um for Pikachu with mq (56:35 - 56:42)
um I can't really use it that much so uh (56:39 - 56:45)
yeah mimiku has been such a huge hit um (56:42 - 56:48)
before mimiku I would be able to dress (56:45 - 56:50)
up Pikachu and just about anything so (56:48 - 56:53)
it'd be like anime or a onesie of (56:50 - 56:56)
another Pokemon or whatever (56:53 - 56:59)
um so yeah I have a ton of dead (56:56 - 57:04)
pikachus is if are are most bases for (56:59 - 57:07)
your amiibos are they Pikachu bases or (57:04 - 57:10)
do you try to like pick a base that (57:07 - 57:13)
would correspond with it I I try to pick (57:10 - 57:16)
a base that would correspond with it um (57:13 - 57:19)
for sure uh if it's Pokemon related it (57:16 - 57:21)
definitely will be most likely a Pikachu (57:19 - 57:22)
or (57:21 - 57:25)
Mewtwo if it's like one of those really (57:22 - 57:27)
ISC characters I tend to use a lot of (57:25 - 57:29)
the Fire Emblem um amiibo because (57:27 - 57:33)
they're more realistic than than most um (57:29 - 57:36)
but majority I would say I've purchased (57:33 - 57:40)
more Pikachus than any other amibo um (57:36 - 57:42)
and Best Buy which is really funny I (57:40 - 57:45)
remember trying to order I think 30 (57:42 - 57:47)
Pikachus and they're just like they (57:45 - 57:49)
called me up and they're just like so (57:47 - 57:53)
we're wondering if you scalp these (57:49 - 57:55)
or and so I had to give them my (57:53 - 57:58)
information and I had to say no this is (57:55 - 58:01)
what I do I basically take the amiibo (57:58 - 58:04)
and then I take it apart and I you know (58:01 - 58:07)
basically cover it up and change it um (58:04 - 58:10)
and they I guess reviewed my work and (58:07 - 58:11)
they're just like all right she's good (58:10 - 58:14)
to go so next you know there's 30 (58:11 - 58:16)
Pikachu at my door so you're like no I (58:14 - 58:18)
don't scalp them I just make them cooler (58:16 - 58:20)
and sell them for even more (58:18 - 58:22)
money it was really cool cuz the guys (58:20 - 58:24)
are just like I like your work by the (58:22 - 58:26)
way it was really I know what they are (58:24 - 58:28)
but they were cool and I was like well (58:26 - 58:29)
thank (58:28 - 58:32)
you so yeah it's definitely Pikachu so (58:29 - 58:35)
Pokemon such a huge influence in my life (58:32 - 58:38)
and again I don't think I'd be in art if (58:35 - 58:43)
it wasn't for the Pokemon um company no (58:38 - 58:45)
that's great uh so when you start with (58:43 - 58:48)
uh when you start making a custom amiibo (58:45 - 58:50)
whether that's mimikyu or or something (58:48 - 58:52)
else how how long is that process is (58:50 - 58:56)
that a couple hours all day all week uh (58:52 - 58:58)
how long does it take to make just one I (58:56 - 59:01)
guess um so it's a really good question (58:58 - 59:05)
and I get that a lot it's hard to really (59:01 - 59:08)
estimate because a good example is (59:05 - 59:12)
detective Pikachu so when that came out (59:08 - 59:16)
to get myself I guess in the in the hype (59:12 - 59:18)
I uh watched Detective Conan and (59:16 - 59:22)
Sherlock all day and um literally (59:18 - 59:23)
detective Pikachu the day it was (59:22 - 59:26)
announced I finished it that night if (59:23 - 59:29)
I'm really inspired by a design or if I (59:26 - 59:32)
really have a passion for for what I'm (59:29 - 59:35)
about to make um it motivates me to no (59:32 - 59:38)
end so I will sit in this chair for (59:35 - 59:41)
hours on end until I finish it so again (59:38 - 59:43)
if I'm really inspired and something was (59:41 - 59:46)
just released you can maybe expect it (59:43 - 59:48)
the next day um which is crazy so I (59:46 - 59:50)
guess that's why people are so surprised (59:48 - 59:53)
that they're really quick um there's a (59:50 - 59:55)
drawback because then I guess people (59:53 - 59:58)
don't realize how much work goes into it (59:55 - 59:59)
yeah cuz I guess they they think that I (59:58 - 60:02)
can just whip these out like crazy but (59:59 - 60:04)
no it's really it's really for the most (60:02 - 60:05)
part the fact that I'm really passionate (60:04 - 60:07)
about what I'm about to make and I can (60:05 - 60:09)
picture what it's going to look like and (60:07 - 60:12)
I'm just excited so it depends I think (60:09 - 60:16)
the most I've ever made in a week was (60:12 - 60:21)
probably I want to say like 20 or 30 and (60:16 - 60:23)
that's right before a convention usually (60:21 - 60:28)
so well it'll work oh I bet can you can (60:23 - 60:30)
you explain a little bit of the the (60:28 - 60:33)
medium you use is that is it mostly clay (60:30 - 60:39)
or some other form of of um art stuff a (60:33 - 60:42)
lot of art stuff for sure um I try to (60:39 - 60:44)
think outside the box and and I try to (60:42 - 60:46)
use things that are unique and and make (60:44 - 60:50)
the amiibo unique because for me I I (60:46 - 60:53)
really want these not to just be toys (60:50 - 60:55)
but I really want them to be (60:53 - 60:58)
things that people are really proud of (60:55 - 61:02)
that they want to display um so if I can (60:58 - 61:06)
make it as unique as possible it it it (61:02 - 61:08)
it makes me feel better that hopefully (61:06 - 61:11)
they'll like it a lot more so um it is (61:08 - 61:13)
definitely a lot of clay uh for the most (61:11 - 61:15)
part it's a lot of clay work um (61:13 - 61:18)
generally I will strip down the amiibo (61:15 - 61:21)
um and try to keep as much of the amibo (61:18 - 61:24)
as possible but you know sometimes you (61:21 - 61:27)
can't use it all so I will cut off some (61:24 - 61:31)
pieces here and there and then clay yeah (61:27 - 61:34)
and then um I have a graveyard I I have (61:31 - 61:36)
a whole amiibo graveyard of just parts (61:34 - 61:38)
and it freaks a lot of people out (61:36 - 61:40)
because they're just like oh my gosh (61:38 - 61:43)
it's so scary to see heads and Limbs and (61:40 - 61:45)
whatever else but for the most part it's (61:43 - 61:50)
a lot of clay and stuff so um yeah how (61:45 - 61:51)
many how many amiibos do you think (61:50 - 61:53)
you've purchased since you've started (61:51 - 61:56)
doing this oh (61:53 - 61:59)
I honestly can't even get you like an (61:56 - 62:03)
estimate because I've done so much and (61:59 - 62:05)
you know I I can't even put the numbers (62:03 - 62:09)
together because I've traveled last year (62:05 - 62:12)
um with Wizard World and uh I even sold (62:09 - 62:15)
amiibo at their convention so truly I (62:12 - 62:18)
have no idea at one point my room was (62:15 - 62:22)
surrounded by amiibos (62:18 - 62:25)
so but um it was funny like people walk (62:22 - 62:26)
in and they would think that they're in (62:25 - 62:30)
like a department store for amiibos so (62:26 - 62:33)
not not a bad place to be yeah yeah yeah (62:30 - 62:36)
it's true so sometimes my friend was (62:33 - 62:37)
just like oh you have that can I trade (62:36 - 62:39)
with you and I was like yeah sure we'll (62:37 - 62:43)
just trade right now right so um but (62:39 - 62:45)
yeah so I noticed in your in your (62:43 - 62:48)
Twitter profile it says custom amiibo (62:45 - 62:50)
artists uh at Wizard World and you just (62:48 - 62:52)
mentioned Wizard World was there some (62:50 - 62:55)
kind of collaboration with you too or (62:52 - 62:57)
was it you know you just went to Wizard (62:55 - 62:59)
World set up a booth started selling (62:57 - 63:02)
amiibo or did they reach out to you and (62:59 - 63:05)
want you to come out um they actually (63:02 - 63:08)
reached out to me and I still have the (63:05 - 63:10)
business card that they gave me because (63:08 - 63:13)
from that moment I knew that there was (63:10 - 63:16)
something special um they they had (63:13 - 63:19)
visited me at my booth um because I was (63:16 - 63:20)
at Evo so I don't know if you know what (63:19 - 63:23)
Evo is but it's this like huge (63:20 - 63:25)
crazy um world's biggest fighting game (63:23 - 63:27)
tournament and I kid you not it's like (63:25 - 63:29)
the world's biggest fighting game (63:27 - 63:32)
tournament it's crazy I advise everyone (63:29 - 63:35)
to go if you love video games fighting (63:32 - 63:38)
games Evo it's amazing it's like my baby (63:35 - 63:41)
convention like I've been going for so (63:38 - 63:44)
long so and it was my first year having (63:41 - 63:45)
a booth so it was like already my dream (63:44 - 63:48)
can true of having a booth at Evo and I (63:45 - 63:52)
see these guys in like really nice suits (63:48 - 63:54)
and they're walking over here and they (63:52 - 63:55)
didn't didn't seem like they play games (63:54 - 63:57)
cuz they're like really in these nice (63:55 - 63:59)
suits but I knew that they had something (63:57 - 64:01)
to do with the gaming industry so they (63:59 - 64:03)
started asking all these questions it's (64:01 - 64:04)
not like they walked into the wrong (64:03 - 64:08)
convention no no they just you know they (64:04 - 64:10)
just looked they were they they were (64:08 - 64:14)
holding themselves to a higher standard (64:10 - 64:15)
for sure because I'm not going to lie (64:14 - 64:17)
when you go to this you know gaming (64:15 - 64:19)
tournament there's there's Bo everywhere (64:17 - 64:21)
you know we're Gamers so you know and (64:19 - 64:23)
they're competing and stuff but it was (64:21 - 64:25)
it was refreshing to see (64:23 - 64:28)
some people in in Tux in tuxedo so they (64:25 - 64:29)
walked over and they started talking to (64:28 - 64:32)
me and you know I just answered all (64:29 - 64:35)
their questions and and uh by the end of (64:32 - 64:37)
it they're just like well you know um we (64:35 - 64:38)
were actually wanting to see you because (64:37 - 64:40)
we knew you're going to be here so this (64:38 - 64:42)
is our business card please make sure (64:40 - 64:45)

business card I have ever (64:48 - 64:53)
seen it was so clean and like the (64:50 - 64:55)
lettering was like shiny (64:53 - 64:58)

they're just like you know when you're (65:00 - 65:04)
in Cali next make sure you stop by the (65:02 - 65:07)
office and that's a whole another story (65:04 - 65:11)
um the first meeting uh that I actually (65:07 - 65:13)
attended for Wizard World which is (65:11 - 65:15)
really funny because I did not look good (65:13 - 65:17)
at all like no no higher standard (65:15 - 65:19)
whatsoever that was like thrown out the (65:17 - 65:23)
window um it was so interesting and it (65:19 - 65:25)
was so funny I'll tell the story because (65:23 - 65:26)
it's actually I think it's interesting (65:25 - 65:30)
so yeah I was going to C I was going to (65:26 - 65:33)
Cali and um I was just like hey you know (65:30 - 65:36)
um let me stop by the office uh it'd be (65:33 - 65:38)
easier that way since I'm heading to (65:36 - 65:40)
Cali anyways and they're like yeah sure (65:38 - 65:42)
that's that's um that's awesome well (65:40 - 65:44)
here's the address whatever I guess I (65:42 - 65:45)
didn't really think think out like the (65:44 - 65:47)
whole process because I've been sitting (65:45 - 65:49)
in this car for like four hours so I (65:47 - 65:51)
don't look good I'm in flip-flops hair (65:49 - 65:55)
messy I look like something had gone (65:51 - 65:59)
wrong so sure I step out of this car um (65:55 - 66:02)
and I go sit in their Lobby and their (65:59 - 66:05)
Lobby is so nice like it has all these (66:02 - 66:08)
pictures of DC Marvel there's a picture (66:05 - 66:11)
of Stan Lee on the side I was just like (66:08 - 66:13)
this is gonna (66:11 - 66:17)
suck so I forewarned them I was just (66:13 - 66:18)
like because I told them I was there I (66:17 - 66:20)
was just like hey I told the secretary I (66:18 - 66:23)
was just like can you let him know that (66:20 - 66:25)
I'm not looking so hot (66:23 - 66:27)
right now and I had three other people (66:25 - 66:29)
with me he came out the guy who (66:27 - 66:31)
represented Wizard World and he was just (66:29 - 66:33)
like all right let's go to the meeting (66:31 - 66:35)
room and I was just like and he was just (66:33 - 66:37)
like yeah everyone can come so it was me (66:35 - 66:39)
and then the these three other guys one (66:37 - 66:43)
of them being my boyfriend and um we go (66:39 - 66:47)
to this like gorgeous like table like (66:43 - 66:49)
you know those long tables where you (66:47 - 66:51)
might need like a megaphone to reach the (66:49 - 66:54)
other end like that's how it was yeah it (66:51 - 66:56)
was really like it was really (66:54 - 66:59)
intimidating so anyways they started (66:56 - 67:02)
just bombarding me with questions right (66:59 - 67:04)
and my three friends I could tell that (67:02 - 67:06)
one of them kind of knew it was going on (67:04 - 67:08)
the other one not so much and then the (67:06 - 67:11)
last guy was just confused so and you (67:08 - 67:13)
were probably thinking like don't (67:11 - 67:16)
embarrass me don't embarrass me oh yeah (67:13 - 67:19)
I was just like oh no I hope like and I (67:16 - 67:21)
put them in that position too so I felt (67:19 - 67:24)
bad so by the end of it you know (67:21 - 67:26)
they they were just like you know what (67:24 - 67:28)
we pretty much want to hire you we want (67:26 - 67:30)
you to make exclusives for us we want (67:28 - 67:32)
you to have your own booth and sell it (67:30 - 67:34)
there and I was just shocked because it (67:32 - 67:36)
was basically like an interview and uh (67:34 - 67:38)
so by the end of it my friends looked at (67:36 - 67:40)
me and they're just like Christine what (67:38 - 67:41)
the heck was (67:40 - 67:44)
that and then my the friend who knew (67:41 - 67:49)
nothing was just like by the way what is (67:44 - 67:49)
amiibo it was just so funny and so (67:49 - 67:55)
surreal so that was probably the biggest (67:51 - 67:57)
I guess gratitude that I've ever gotten (67:55 - 68:00)
through this whole process of amiibo is (67:57 - 68:02)
um being able to travel with Wizard (68:00 - 68:05)
World so that was a really cool (68:02 - 68:07)
opportunity story ended there you go no (68:05 - 68:10)
that's an incredible story is is that (68:07 - 68:12)
when did that H is is that something (68:10 - 68:13)
still going on or was that kind of a (68:12 - 68:15)
year thing or a two-year thing when did (68:13 - 68:17)
that happen well that happened last year (68:15 - 68:20)
at the beginning of last year um and I (68:17 - 68:22)
could continue traveling with them if I (68:20 - 68:26)
wanted um however ever it was fun it was (68:22 - 68:28)
fun traveling don't get me wrong but (68:26 - 68:29)
right now I definitely want to (68:28 - 68:32)
concentrate on just making stuff that I (68:29 - 68:36)
want to make and teaching and YouTube (68:32 - 68:38)
tutorials and all these other you know (68:36 - 68:42)
prospects so traveling was fun it was (68:38 - 68:44)
like a year for me to kind of see the (68:42 - 68:46)
world you know experience yeah (68:44 - 68:49)
experience people and and meet people (68:46 - 68:51)
and and cherish all the moments and (68:49 - 68:53)
stuff but I think this year it's time to (68:51 - 68:56)
like you know know buckle down and and (68:53 - 69:00)
get everything started so is the the (68:56 - 69:03)
amiibo thing is that like a full-time (69:00 - 69:05)
job for you or is that just is or is (69:03 - 69:06)
that a hobby and it sounds like a (69:05 - 69:08)
full-time job but I don't want to I (69:06 - 69:10)
don't want to assume anything oh no no (69:08 - 69:11)
problem um you know what it's a (69:10 - 69:12)
full-time (69:11 - 69:16)
job um definitely for sure a full-time (69:12 - 69:19)
job the amount of orders I get or it's (69:16 - 69:22)
just staggering um and I'm not trying to (69:19 - 69:24)
put myself on a higher or you know make (69:22 - 69:25)
myself sound good but it's just you know (69:24 - 69:28)
even for one person it's it's a lot so (69:25 - 69:31)
kudos to all the other customizers or (69:28 - 69:34)
even artists and general because I did I (69:31 - 69:37)
had never done commissions until amiibos (69:34 - 69:40)
um for the most part and I mean handling (69:37 - 69:43)
the emails shipping making the order (69:40 - 69:46)
like it's a lot to handle for one person (69:43 - 69:49)
yeah so uh it's definitely a full-time (69:46 - 69:54)
job um the transition between retail job (69:49 - 69:56)
and then going to amiibo and YouTube and (69:54 - 69:59)
all those other things was definitely a (69:56 - 70:01)
challenge but I'm happy where it got me (69:59 - 70:04)
I'm thankful that I can be able to do (70:01 - 70:08)
this as a living and yeah I love it and (70:04 - 70:10)
cherish every moment so awesome a lot of (70:08 - 70:13)
work yeah no totally was there is there (70:10 - 70:17)
amiibo that stands out that is that is (70:13 - 70:18)
like your all-time favorite I know you (70:17 - 70:20)
mentioned your very first one the flat (70:18 - 70:22)
the Pikachu Flash and then you mentioned (70:20 - 70:23)
the aada amiibo but is there another one (70:22 - 70:28)
that kind really stands out yes and um I (70:23 - 70:30)
actually have several I have a lot but (70:28 - 70:32)
the one I guess that hit me the quickest (70:30 - 70:35)
was probably um armored Mewtwo so when I (70:32 - 70:38)
made that um I tried going all out on (70:35 - 70:42)
that one so that one probably is most (70:38 - 70:44)
likely my favorite one out of all the (70:42 - 70:46)
ones that I've done and it's crazy (70:44 - 70:48)
because I actually don't keep any (70:46 - 70:51)
Customs unless it's from other artists (70:48 - 70:54)
most of my work I tend to give away or (70:51 - 70:56)
sell or whatever um but the ones I do (70:54 - 70:59)
keep are all Customs by other artists (70:56 - 71:02)
so the Mewtwo one I sold a while back (70:59 - 71:05)
which is pretty awesome but and do you (71:02 - 71:08)
commission wise do you get just requests (71:05 - 71:10)
of people going hey I want a whoop or (71:08 - 71:12)
amiibo or do you get people you probably (71:10 - 71:14)
get both or do you get people that that (71:12 - 71:16)
ask hey can you do can you recreate (71:14 - 71:18)
armored Mewtwo because that's what I (71:16 - 71:22)
want yeah I do I get I get definitely um (71:18 - 71:25)
a bit of both um to make it easier on (71:22 - 71:27)
myself though I tend to lean towards (71:25 - 71:30)
more of the like oh I want a mimikyu or (71:27 - 71:32)
you know detective Pikachu or whatever (71:30 - 71:35)
commission wise I try to make sure that (71:32 - 71:36)
I don't (71:35 - 71:42)
overflow or overwork myself um so yeah I (71:36 - 71:45)
I'll take commissions on a timely matter (71:42 - 71:48)
I wish I can clone myself but uh you (71:45 - 71:51)
know technolog is not there yet so have (71:48 - 71:54)
have you cons have you considered the (71:51 - 71:56)
getting help maybe not for just the art (71:54 - 71:57)
aspect but maybe just for the emails and (71:56 - 72:00)
the shipping and pretty much everything (71:57 - 72:02)
but the art are are you at that level (72:00 - 72:04)
yet or hope to get to that level I hope (72:02 - 72:06)
to get to that level um what I really (72:04 - 72:10)
want to strive for um is just doing (72:06 - 72:14)
crafts in general and teaching so that's (72:10 - 72:16)
why I've been really trying to push my (72:14 - 72:18)
YouTube a lot more because I definitely (72:16 - 72:20)
want to teach and and you know doing (72:18 - 72:23)
commissions and and doing the the same (72:20 - 72:25)
amiibo over and over and over again it (72:23 - 72:29)
takes a lot of creativity away so there (72:25 - 72:31)
are things that I haven't done that I've (72:29 - 72:33)
been waning to make you know just for (72:31 - 72:36)
myself even so hopefully if everything (72:33 - 72:39)
goes well um I'll do I'll be doing (72:36 - 72:42)
tutorials so other people can make (72:39 - 72:44)
custom amiibo um and then I'll be doing (72:42 - 72:46)
projects that I want to do here and (72:44 - 72:49)
there so that's the main goal of this (72:46 - 72:52)
year I love commissions but that's (72:49 - 72:56)
basically why I have gray hairs (72:52 - 73:00)
everywhere outside of amiibos and your (72:56 - 73:03)
world of art is what do you what's your (73:00 - 73:05)
free time like or is it nothing but work (73:03 - 73:10)
you sound very busy you I try to I try (73:05 - 73:13)
to work as much as possible my free time (73:10 - 73:14)
probably (73:13 - 73:17)
involves hiking here and there I collect (73:14 - 73:21)
a lot of board games so board games um I (73:17 - 73:24)
haven't had that much time to play games (73:21 - 73:27)
either so you know it's really hard to (73:24 - 73:30)
balance everything so hopefully you know (73:27 - 73:33)
later down the road hopefully later this (73:30 - 73:35)
year I'll be able to really concentrate (73:33 - 73:37)
on YouTube and and making stuff that I (73:35 - 73:41)
want and finally having time to play the (73:37 - 73:43)
switch and all this other stuff because (73:41 - 73:47)
definitely amiibo take up a lot of time (73:43 - 73:49)
a lot of time and I love it I do you (73:47 - 73:50)
know especially when people get their (73:49 - 73:52)
order in the mail like I flip out (73:50 - 73:54)
especially if they really love it it but (73:52 - 73:58)
it's a lot of work yeah so it's (73:54 - 74:01)
definitely a lot of work but uh we'll (73:58 - 74:02)
see how it goes I definitely want to (74:01 - 74:05)
teach people and that's like my favorite (74:02 - 74:07)
part is is trying to influence other (74:05 - 74:10)
people to be creative I just have a few (74:07 - 74:14)
more questions for you one being have (74:10 - 74:16)
you played Pokemon Sun and Moon and what (74:14 - 74:18)
your thoughts on it and follow-up (74:16 - 74:20)
question of just what your favorite (74:18 - 74:24)
Pokemon game in general is okay so (74:20 - 74:27)
with a new Pokemon Sun and Moon I (74:24 - 74:29)
haven't gotten to play with it and I've (74:27 - 74:30)
been wanting to the moment it got (74:29 - 74:33)
released I knew that this would probably (74:30 - 74:35)
be my favorite Pokemon game ever but (74:33 - 74:39)
with the amount mimic came in yeah then (74:35 - 74:41)
the mimik keys came in and then the Riu (74:39 - 74:45)
and then you know executor so it just it (74:41 - 74:48)
was a lot and and that's why I (74:45 - 74:50)
definitely want to have more time to (74:48 - 74:52)
play these games and I know Pokemon Sun (74:50 - 74:54)
and Moon is most likely going to be my (74:52 - 74:56)
favorite game because it reminds me of (74:54 - 75:00)
Hawaii um and I love Hawaii just the I (74:56 - 75:02)
mean just mimikyu itself it's it's such (75:00 - 75:07)
an adorable design you know I love it I (75:02 - 75:09)
love it and that and Raichu you know so (75:07 - 75:10)
when I saw them when they got released (75:09 - 75:12)
and Marowak I was just like those are (75:10 - 75:15)
the coolest designs ever you know (75:12 - 75:18)
especially for Cubone and and Raichu a (75:15 - 75:21)
different takee on them so sadly I (75:18 - 75:24)
haven't gotten the time to play them um (75:21 - 75:27)
hopefully during this year I will and (75:24 - 75:29)
for some OD reason the the Pokemon game (75:27 - 75:32)
that pops in my mind is Pokemon Coliseum (75:29 - 75:35)
on the GameCube yeah I'm (75:32 - 75:37)
familiar that one for some reason Pops (75:35 - 75:38)
in my head because I do remember (75:37 - 75:40)
spending so many hours on that and then (75:38 - 75:42)
the second installment came in and I (75:40 - 75:44)
could never get the dark Lugia and I (75:42 - 75:45)
really wanted (75:44 - 75:47)
that that's you know what that's (75:45 - 75:49)
probably the reason why it's popping in (75:47 - 75:51)
my head out of all the games is because (75:49 - 75:54)
I still have unfinished business but but (75:51 - 75:56)
uh hopefully hopefully one day I'll be (75:54 - 76:00)
able to go back and and uh and finish it (75:56 - 76:01)
so I know the switch is going to have (76:00 - 76:04)
some GameCube games so I'm definitely (76:01 - 76:07)
looking forward to it um I'm G to try to (76:04 - 76:10)
make some time for the switch at least (76:07 - 76:12)
um because there's so many games on that (76:10 - 76:14)
that I want to play yeah we're like two (76:12 - 76:17)
weeks away now from it I know two weeks (76:14 - 76:19)
away and and I can't believe it I am (76:17 - 76:21)
just astonished that time is flying by (76:19 - 76:24)
so quickly it was so funny because you (76:21 - 76:26)
know I'm on the west coast and I know (76:24 - 76:29)
your Central Area yep and you had wanted (76:26 - 76:32)
a specific time time escapes me so I (76:29 - 76:34)
thought it was supposed to be my time so (76:32 - 76:36)
when he had messaged me I was just like (76:34 - 76:37)
oh (76:36 - 76:39)
shoot because I was going to take a (76:37 - 76:42)
shower I was like I gotta look good and (76:39 - 76:43)
then you said it's only audio and I was (76:42 - 76:46)
like thank God because I look (76:43 - 76:51)
terrible so yeah time is the enemy I I (76:46 - 76:55)
wish I can clone myself but no it's just (76:51 - 76:57)
me well I got I have one more question (76:55 - 77:00)
for you and then you can you can shower (76:57 - 77:01)
and get back to (77:00 - 77:04)
amibo oh no I could send all day I love (77:01 - 77:07)
podcasts honestly it's an honor for me (77:04 - 77:09)
to be here for you to take time to talk (77:07 - 77:12)
to me like that's that's awesome I (77:09 - 77:14)
really do appreciate it I love podcasts (77:12 - 77:16)
so I hope I'm funny enough that no no (77:14 - 77:19)
it's been it's been awesome so far thank (77:16 - 77:22)
you uh What uh to wrap it up what is (77:19 - 77:25)
your favorite Pokémon oh my favorite (77:22 - 77:27)
Pokemon all right so it's really weird (77:25 - 77:32)
um but and it's really dorky but I like (77:27 - 77:34)
Pidgey and the reason why is because I (77:32 - 77:36)
remember eating with my friends one day (77:34 - 77:39)
and this is when I was really quiet so I (77:36 - 77:42)
was really to myself and I guess my (77:39 - 77:43)
friends saw me picking at my food and (77:42 - 77:45)
they were just like man you're like a (77:43 - 77:48)
bird you eat like a bird so that's stuck (77:45 - 77:51)
with me and I always love Pidgey Pidgeot (77:48 - 77:53)
Pidgeotto like it's just such a cool (77:51 - 77:57)
design I love birds overall um so Pidgey (77:53 - 77:58)
has definitely been my favorite but if (77:57 - 78:01)
I'm going into battle if I'm entering a (77:58 - 78:04)
tornament for Super Smash Bros it's (78:01 - 78:05)
always going to be (78:04 - 78:08)
Pikachu that's like my main I had to go (78:05 - 78:10)
with my main and and Pikachu is my (78:08 - 78:13)
homeboy so all right both good answers I (78:10 - 78:15)
mean I think how how can you be wrong (78:13 - 78:19)
with with either Pidgey or Pikachu yeah (78:15 - 78:21)
F's cute he's adorable I mean he's not (78:19 - 78:24)
like the coolest Pokemon but but I mean (78:21 - 78:26)
you know he's adorable he's cute he can (78:24 - 78:29)
write him when he evolves right so yep (78:26 - 78:31)
it it's funny because they just added (78:29 - 78:36)
generation 2 to Pokemon go and I know (78:31 - 78:38)
and I know I encountered a hoot hoot and (78:36 - 78:41)
I was like oh yeah hoo hoot is actually (78:38 - 78:44)
pretty cool like yeah he is he's so cute (78:41 - 78:48)
and and rowlet is even cooler I love ret (78:44 - 78:51)
he's awesome but yeah Pokemon go just (78:48 - 78:53)
came out and I feel so bad cuz I did (78:51 - 78:55)
used to play it and then I stopped (78:53 - 78:57)
playing it because I lost my phone so (78:55 - 79:00)
all my data was gone oh man I know and I (78:57 - 79:02)
was so upset I was so upset because I (79:00 - 79:06)
put time and effort and (79:02 - 79:09)
money that's how they get you I know (79:06 - 79:11)
they got me they got me oh man hopefully (79:09 - 79:14)
I'll just jump back into it but yeah no (79:11 - 79:16)
it's a good time I even I was at the (79:14 - 79:18)
mall just for a little bit today and I (79:16 - 79:20)
saw I saw a handful of people obviously (79:18 - 79:22)
playing Pokémon go so that was that was (79:20 - 79:23)
cool to see cuz I haven't seen that in a (79:22 - 79:26)
while and I'm in Wisconsin so it's it's (79:23 - 79:28)
like 20° outside so I get why people AR (79:26 - 79:30)
gosh I get why people aren't playing (79:28 - 79:32)
Pokémon go and that's that's why I went (79:30 - 79:33)
to the mall because I just wanted to (79:32 - 79:34)
make sure I wanted to like experience (79:33 - 79:36)

is from Michael says hello spj and crw (81:59 - 82:04)
silly question to ask but do you (82:02 - 82:06)
remember your dreams if so have you ever (82:04 - 82:09)
dreamt anything Pokemon related I have a (82:06 - 82:12)
few times where few times and they have (82:09 - 82:15)
always been a treat one time I dreamt (82:12 - 82:17)
that I was invited to the Oscars and (82:15 - 82:21)
brought my boy bronzong with me but it (82:17 - 82:23)
was turned away at the entrance because (82:21 - 82:26)
my companion wasn't cute enough dreams (82:23 - 82:28)
are weird I would love to hear stories (82:26 - 82:30)
thanks for the quality show every week (82:28 - 82:33)
have a great day Michael wow bronzong is (82:30 - 82:36)
a cutie although it wouldn't it's not (82:33 - 82:39)
allowed in the Gen 4 Park where (82:36 - 82:42)
specifically only quote unquote cute (82:39 - 82:45)
Pokemon are allowed you can only bring a (82:42 - 82:47)
very select amount of Pokemon to walk (82:45 - 82:50)
with you oddly enough it's not welcome (82:47 - 82:53)
to Milwaukee County Parks either oh of (82:50 - 82:58)
course not nice dig so um I recently was (82:53 - 83:00)
playing Pokemon Moon before I went to (82:58 - 83:01)
bed because I'm trying to finish my (83:00 - 83:05)
pokedex in Pokemon Moon and that night I (83:01 - 83:08)
dreamed about visiting a zoo and seeing (83:05 - 83:10)
all sorts of different animals that were (83:08 - 83:12)
very like not like lions tigers and (83:10 - 83:14)
bears but like unique and odd and (83:12 - 83:17)
strange not like Earthly animals so I (83:14 - 83:18)
think there was some sort of (83:17 - 83:20)
relationship between me going through my (83:18 - 83:23)
Pokedex and dreaming about visiting that (83:20 - 83:26)
kind of a zoo so there you go the best I (83:23 - 83:29)
can do it's very rare that I remember my (83:26 - 83:31)
dreams when I (83:29 - 83:37)
do they are not that thematically (83:31 - 83:39)
consistent (83:37 - 83:44)
um I I'm sure I have had dreams of (83:39 - 83:46)
Pokemon the vast majority of them I (83:44 - 83:48)
probably don't remember and I can't (83:46 - 83:51)
think of any off the top of my head that (83:48 - 83:54)
I I do because I can (83:51 - 83:56)
over the past year there's only like one (83:54 - 83:58)
dream I actually remember having it's (83:56 - 84:00)
very rare that I remember my dreams uh (83:58 - 84:03)
next email here is from Jose from San (84:00 - 84:06)
Juan Puerto Rico pretty cool place uh (84:03 - 84:08)
obviously you've never been to San Juan (84:06 - 84:10)
actually one of my favorite restaurants (84:08 - 84:11)
in the world is in San Juan so I will (84:10 - 84:13)
take one step away from that but all (84:11 - 84:17)
right yeah hey guys always a pleasure to (84:13 - 84:18)
listen to your great show and your (84:17 - 84:21)
refute SL debate with SBJ internally I (84:18 - 84:24)
was writing into disagree with how (84:21 - 84:26)
easily you guys discount the survival of (84:24 - 84:28)
the Nintendo 3DS there are still a few (84:26 - 84:31)
games coming out for 2017 and they have (84:28 - 84:34)
begun planning out 2018 games why do I (84:31 - 84:35)
think the switch won't be replaced by (84:34 - 84:38)
the 3DS is the price if it was a $50 (84:35 - 84:40)
difference it would make or that would (84:38 - 84:44)
make more sense but at $300 vers $199 or (84:40 - 84:47)
even the cheaper $89 2DS there is no (84:44 - 84:49)
doubt that the 3DS will live on a way (84:47 - 84:51)
that they could make it have more legs (84:49 - 84:53)
and cut the price of the 3DS and (84:51 - 84:57)
Nintendo 3DS XL and bring in a bunch of (84:53 - 84:59)
new players Nintendo themselves may not (84:57 - 85:02)
be developing much for it but third (84:59 - 85:03)
parties don't look like they'll stop (85:02 - 85:06)
anytime soon since s since isse loves (85:03 - 85:10)
list here is an upcoming list of 3DS (85:06 - 85:13)
titles for 2017 Monster Hunter XX (85:10 - 85:16)
Cooking Mama Sweet Shop Story Of Seasons (85:13 - 85:19)
Trio of towns Mario Sports Superstars (85:16 - 85:22)
tank Troopers Fire Emblem Echoes of (85:19 - 85:25)
Shadows of uh Valentine's Day Fire (85:22 - 85:28)
Emblem Warriors Blaster Master zero the (85:25 - 85:31)
snack World lady Leighton The Who Wants (85:28 - 85:34)
To Be A Millionaire uh Pikmin 3DS (85:31 - 85:37)
Farming Simulator 18 ever Oasis box boy (85:34 - 85:41)
3 antidote DX runbox pocket and I'm sure (85:37 - 85:44)
there are five to 10 more announced Jose (85:41 - 85:48)
so I want to call one thing into (85:44 - 85:51)
question here that I I will say much (85:48 - 85:54)
like our uh us press nowadays says if (85:51 - 85:55)
you say one thing wrong then we're just (85:54 - 85:58)
going to throw everything in the garbage (85:55 - 86:03)
uh there has been no monster hunter XX (85:58 - 86:05)
announced for English so oh yeah we're (86:03 - 86:07)
not we're not getting we're not getting (86:05 - 86:10)
that game that monster hunter XX is just (86:07 - 86:13)
a better version of generations I mean (86:10 - 86:15)
it's it's literally just like an (86:13 - 86:19)
enhanced if the 3DS had had DLC that you (86:15 - 86:21)
could pay for they just that's what it (86:19 - 86:23)
would be is isn't it cuz it's like even (86:21 - 86:25)
carries over your your progress from (86:23 - 86:27)
Monster Hunter X so the thing about (86:25 - 86:31)
monster hunter is America always gets (86:27 - 86:35)
the ultimate edition right so 3u or (86:31 - 86:38)
4u that was always the version of the (86:35 - 86:42)
game that included G Rank and included (86:38 - 86:45)
more monsters so Japan would always get (86:42 - 86:47)
Monster Hunter 3 and then they would get (86:45 - 86:49)
Monster Hunter 3u and then America would (86:47 - 86:51)
always get Monster Hunter 3u so it was (86:49 - 86:53)
really weird (86:51 - 86:54)
when we got (86:53 - 86:57)
Generations uh because Generations (86:54 - 86:59)
doesn't include G Rank and it doesn't (86:57 - 87:01)
include some other stuff that monster (86:59 - 87:04)
hunter XX does include Monster Hunter (87:01 - 87:06)
Generations isn't an actual numbered (87:04 - 87:08)
Monster Hunter game uh what Capcom has (87:06 - 87:10)
said and the Monster Hunter team said is (87:08 - 87:12)
like Monster Hunter Generations is like (87:10 - 87:15)
a greatest hits It's a celebration this (87:12 - 87:16)
is there were the words they used a (87:15 - 87:18)
celebration of the monster hunter games (87:16 - 87:20)
made uh since then so no I don't I don't (87:18 - 87:23)
think I don't think we're getting excess (87:20 - 87:25)
honestly I think uh we'll probably get (87:23 - 87:27)
Monster Hunter 5 or whatever the next (87:25 - 87:29)
version is so yeah that that has not (87:27 - 87:31)
been announced uh Cookie Mama I don't (87:29 - 87:33)
think has ever been good besides the (87:31 - 87:36)
very first game Mario Sports Superstar (87:33 - 87:38)
there hasn't been a good Mario sports (87:36 - 87:41)
game ever uh besides the original like (87:38 - 87:43)
Mario Golf Mario Tennis let's let's go (87:41 - 87:45)
back to to the original question right (87:43 - 87:48)
the fact is that just because there is a (87:45 - 87:50)
long tale of games that are going to be (87:48 - 87:52)
released all that means is nintend (87:50 - 87:54)
Nintendo has not told any of the (87:52 - 87:56)
developers or or didn't tell any of the (87:54 - 87:58)
developers were pulling the plug on the (87:56 - 88:01)
3DS until recently and it's like they're (87:58 - 88:03)
like well we've already put all this (88:01 - 88:06)
money into these games so we'll release (88:03 - 88:09)
them yeah I mean the thing is that these (88:06 - 88:11)
games weren't being made yesterday (88:09 - 88:13)
they've been in development well before (88:11 - 88:15)
the switch was even announced yeah I (88:13 - 88:17)
mean even in our rapid fire world of (88:15 - 88:21)
mobile app development um these types of (88:17 - 88:23)
games of the complex that we expect and (88:21 - 88:27)
the quality we expect probably take 2 to (88:23 - 88:31)
3 years to for a full development cycle (88:27 - 88:33)
that that I mean that's completely my (88:31 - 88:34)
imagination somebody could prove me (88:33 - 88:37)
completely wrong but I would have to say (88:34 - 88:39)
because it's not only the programming of (88:37 - 88:41)
the games and everything but developing (88:39 - 88:43)
the marketing strategy negotiating what (88:41 - 88:45)
the release date is I mean I'm sure (88:43 - 88:47)
release dates for video games nowadays (88:45 - 88:49)
are as highly (88:47 - 88:52)
strategized and negotiated as release (88:49 - 88:55)
dates for movies right you notice there (88:52 - 88:57)
are certain movies that are re released (88:55 - 88:59)
on Fourth of July weekend and there are (88:57 - 89:00)
certain movies that are released on (88:59 - 89:02)
Thanksgiving weekend and there are (89:00 - 89:04)
certain movies that are released in (89:02 - 89:07)
December and you know you don't have (89:04 - 89:10)
just random things come out whenever (89:07 - 89:13)
they want there is a strategy for when (89:10 - 89:14)
Studios pick when a movie is going to be (89:13 - 89:17)
released there is a strategy for when (89:14 - 89:20)
developers negotiate with Nintendo for (89:17 - 89:21)
when they're allowed to release their (89:20 - 89:24)
title and there Nintendo is not going to (89:21 - 89:26)
say well we're we're stopping (89:24 - 89:28)
development on the 3DS dump all your (89:26 - 89:33)
games onto the market in by March 30th (89:28 - 89:34)
no they're still going to keep that (89:33 - 89:37)
longtail release schedule yeah and it's (89:34 - 89:41)
just like when like I I like like I said (89:37 - 89:43)
last week or whenever I said it I don't (89:41 - 89:47)
see much of a life after the 3DS even (89:43 - 89:49)
like you list these games and that's (89:47 - 89:50)
like the only game out of all these (89:49 - 89:52)
games that I'm interested in is is (89:50 - 89:55)
Pikmin 3DS but honestly I probably won't (89:52 - 89:57)
get it because the 3DS has just been my (89:55 - 89:59)
either monster hunter or Pokemon device (89:57 - 90:01)
uh and Monster Hunter XX I'm interested (89:59 - 90:02)
in but I I doubt that's coming to the US (90:01 - 90:05)
if it is cool but I I don't think so if (90:02 - 90:07)
you looked at consoles that transition (90:05 - 90:09)
like Playstation One into two or two (90:07 - 90:11)
into three or let's let's go just two (90:09 - 90:13)
three years ago when PlayStation 3 (90:11 - 90:16)
transitioned into PlayStation 4 what (90:13 - 90:20)
happens is PlayStation 3 still exists it (90:16 - 90:23)
still has games coming out but not a lot (90:20 - 90:25)
and none of them are really that (90:23 - 90:26)
groundbreaking I think the last really (90:25 - 90:28)
great game for PS3 which was on the tail (90:26 - 90:32)
end of of its its life cycle was the (90:28 - 90:35)
last of us and then PS4 comes out and (90:32 - 90:39)
they overlap and the PS4 doesn't have a (90:35 - 90:41)
really great lineup because people are (90:39 - 90:43)
still making games for PS3 or they're (90:41 - 90:45)
still like mid development on PS3 and so (90:43 - 90:46)
that's what's going to happen here you (90:45 - 90:48)
already see it you see that we have a (90:46 - 90:53)
weak lineup for 2017 for 3DS I mean I (90:48 - 90:55)
mean you listed a bunch of games but I I (90:53 - 90:58)
would be surprised if if a listener was (90:55 - 91:00)
excited for every single one of those (90:58 - 91:02)
games I would AR I would bet that most (91:00 - 91:05)
listeners are excited for one to three (91:02 - 91:06)
of those games on this list cuz everyone (91:05 - 91:09)
has such different gaming habits so you (91:06 - 91:11)
have this weak lineup of 3DS games for (91:09 - 91:14)
2017 and you have this weak lineup for (91:11 - 91:17)
the switch for 2017 and that makes sense (91:14 - 91:18)
not not saying that that that's bad for (91:17 - 91:21)
switch that just makes sense for any new (91:18 - 91:23)
console of people just don't have enough (91:21 - 91:27)
time developing so when such and such (91:23 - 91:29)
company finishes lady Leighton The Who (91:27 - 91:32)
Wants To Be A Millionaire they have the (91:29 - 91:35)
option now to make another 3DS game or (91:32 - 91:36)
make a switch game and let me tell you (91:35 - 91:38)
they're probably going to make a switch (91:36 - 91:40)
game after that like that is what makes (91:38 - 91:45)
the most sense uh for for market for uh (91:40 - 91:49)
deals for probably the ease of of how (91:45 - 91:51)
everyone says that how every developer (91:49 - 91:53)
so far has said that the switch is very (91:51 - 91:55)
easy to develop on compared to previous (91:53 - 91:57)
Nintendo consoles and if it's easier to (91:55 - 91:59)
develop on that's less money that's less (91:57 - 92:02)
time that's more profit this list might (91:59 - 92:05)
be this list of games and the ones not (92:02 - 92:07)
not on this list might be adequate (92:05 - 92:10)
enough to carry the 3DS into 2 to carry (92:07 - 92:12)
the 3DS for the rest of this year and (92:10 - 92:14)
I'm sure that you know 3DS will still (92:12 - 92:17)
sell fine and that these games will sell (92:14 - 92:22)
well but I would urge you to watch what (92:17 - 92:23)
games are going to get announced for the (92:22 - 92:24)
rest of the year because you probably (92:23 - 92:27)
won't hear a lot you might hear one or (92:24 - 92:31)
two or three games from Nintendo that (92:27 - 92:32)
that honestly they've probably been in (92:31 - 92:34)
development for a while and that's the (92:32 - 92:35)
only reason they're getting announced is (92:34 - 92:37)
because all right well you know we (92:35 - 92:40)
already spent 18 months on this game (92:37 - 92:41)
Let's announce it at E3 cuz it's going (92:40 - 92:43)
to be done in four more months and let's (92:41 - 92:44)
get it out the door and then we're going (92:43 - 92:45)
we're going to move that development (92:44 - 92:47)
team to switch cuz Nintendo's already (92:45 - 92:50)
said every single one of their first (92:47 - 92:52)
party develop like every every single (92:50 - 92:55)
one of their first party development (92:52 - 92:56)
companies are working on switch I don't (92:55 - 92:58)
think any of those companies are just (92:56 - 93:00)
going to suddenly go back to 3DS as soon (92:58 - 93:02)
as they're done with switch does that (93:00 - 93:05)
include game freak uh apparently that (93:02 - 93:06)
includes game freak they said every (93:05 - 93:08)
single one of their companies game freak (93:06 - 93:09)
might be an exception though CU that (93:08 - 93:11)
weird Nintendo doesn't own them fully (93:09 - 93:13)
and they made that weird elephant game (93:11 - 93:15)
that was really bad on PlayStation and (93:13 - 93:19)
Xbox you bought it it's not good not (93:15 - 93:22)
good there was a game release (93:19 - 93:27)
on the PlayStation 2 in late 2014 no (93:22 - 93:30)
sorry late 2013 wrap your brain around (93:27 - 93:33)
that I mean Destiny came out on PS3 and (93:30 - 93:36)
Xbox 360 and that was one of the few (93:33 - 93:39)
like quote unquote new games that came (93:36 - 93:42)
out on those consoles when no PS4 (93:39 - 93:46)
talking PS2 I'm talking no no I'm just (93:42 - 93:49)
saying I'm talking a few weeks before (93:46 - 93:52)
the PlayStation 4 came out (93:49 - 93:54)
someone thought it was a good idea to (93:52 - 93:56)
release Pro Evolution (93:54 - 93:58)
Soccer (93:56 - 94:01)
2014 Europe on the PlayStation 2 correct (93:58 - 94:05)
there's a there's a company at not well (94:01 - 94:07)
not a well there's a game company that (94:05 - 94:09)
comes to Midwest Gaming Classic which is (94:07 - 94:11)
coming up by the way I think in April (94:09 - 94:15)
they are making a brand new NES game (94:11 - 94:16)
that yeah yeah yeah I've heard about (94:15 - 94:19)
that but I mean that's like they're like (94:16 - 94:22)
doing it on purpose they're like (94:19 - 94:25)
like that's (94:22 - 94:25)
the like that's the thing about it is (94:25 - 94:31)
that it's bold because they're (94:28 - 94:35)
doing that Konami was just like I (94:31 - 94:39)
bet we would I bet it's it wasn't like a (94:35 - 94:42)
stunt it was they thought it was a (94:39 - 94:44)
financially viable decision for the pal (94:42 - 94:48)
region to release proevolution soccer (94:44 - 94:53)
2014 in late 2013 on the PlayStation 2 (94:48 - 94:55)
not even a full month before the (94:53 - 94:58)
PlayStation 4 came out I'm sure it sold (94:55 - 95:01)
well I'm sure it did I'm sure they knew (94:58 - 95:04)
exactly what they were doing if I mean (95:01 - 95:06)
that's just proof of the fact that there (95:04 - 95:09)
is more evidence of your claim of how (95:06 - 95:10)
there's that sort of strange overlap (95:09 - 95:16)
between console Generations I am not (95:10 - 95:20)
very good at making predictions I happen (95:16 - 95:23)
to agree with Steve and Will's diagnosis (95:20 - 95:25)
but I mean I'm not very good at making (95:23 - 95:27)
predictions in the first place so don't (95:25 - 95:30)
trust me on this but I would just (95:27 - 95:32)
venture to say that if you aren't seeing (95:30 - 95:36)
a I mean you're seeing some like second (95:32 - 95:39)
partyish stuff I mean is is Fire Emblem (95:36 - 95:42)
is whatever developer makes that are (95:39 - 95:46)
they second part yeah yeah they're like (95:42 - 95:49)
they're they're along the same lines of (95:46 - 95:52)
like the Hal Laboratory (95:49 - 95:54)
yeah so if you don't (95:52 - 95:58)
see the fact to me the fact that as far (95:54 - 96:02)
as we know are no like first party huge (95:58 - 96:05)
like first party games planned besides (96:02 - 96:07)
Pikmin but again that game had to be in (96:05 - 96:09)
development for over a year at this (96:07 - 96:12)
point that to me says that Nintendo is (96:09 - 96:14)
at least abandoning this system and I (96:12 - 96:17)
find it hard to believe that a legion of (96:14 - 96:19)
third party developers would keep it (96:17 - 96:22)
alive just because like I recognize the (96:19 - 96:25)
argument that a lot of people have 3DS's (96:22 - 96:27)
but it's just I I don't think that's (96:25 - 96:30)
really sustainable for very long (96:27 - 96:34)
resuming the switch at I mean the Wii U (96:30 - 96:36)
wasn't even successful but it was (96:34 - 96:40)
successful enough to kill development of (96:36 - 96:42)
the Wii and I would anticipate that the (96:40 - 96:45)
switch is at least I mean I hope so for (96:42 - 96:47)
Nintendo's sake that the switch is going (96:45 - 96:49)
to be at least as (96:47 - 96:52)
successful as the Wii U you know what (96:49 - 96:55)
I'm saying um yeah and I realize I'm (96:52 - 96:56)
talking apples to oranges in some sense (96:55 - 96:59)
because I'm comparing handhelds to (96:56 - 97:01)
console to whatever that we want to call (96:59 - 97:03)
the switch but I think it's still a (97:01 - 97:06)
discussion to be had also like the uh (97:03 - 97:09)
the the thing not being said right here (97:06 - 97:12)
is the security on 3DS like the fact (97:09 - 97:15)
that people were able to somebody was (97:12 - 97:17)
able to get sun and moon and then dump (97:15 - 97:20)
that entire game onto a computer and (97:17 - 97:23)
then give it to other people before (97:20 - 97:25)
release if I was a developer and I knew (97:23 - 97:27)
that the security flaws were that big on (97:25 - 97:29)
3DS and they've only gotten worse with (97:27 - 97:32)
the years and I think from what I've (97:29 - 97:35)
heard reporting on from other podcasts (97:32 - 97:39)
that are more into the general gaming (97:35 - 97:42)
news and Reporting there is really no (97:39 - 97:45)
fix for that anymore the the way that (97:42 - 97:48)
theyve hacked the 3DS and have been able (97:45 - 97:50)
to just pretty much get any game they (97:48 - 97:54)
want for free is a huge problem and it (97:50 - 97:57)
seems like Nintendo is done fixing that (97:54 - 97:59)
like they can't like anytime they've (97:57 - 98:01)
released a patch recently those people (97:59 - 98:04)
have th those people those people have (98:01 - 98:07)
gotten around it like and it's not a (98:04 - 98:10)
problem for them to continue using their (98:07 - 98:13)
security to play games quote like (98:10 - 98:15)
illegally or however you want to (98:13 - 98:17)
classify it not paying for Pokemon Sun (98:15 - 98:20)
and Moon and just playing that and if (98:17 - 98:21)
I'm a developer and I now see that the (98:20 - 98:24)
switch is out and okay well 3DS has a (98:21 - 98:26)
really big Market they have X amount of (98:24 - 98:29)
millions of units out there but switch (98:26 - 98:30)
is really new and that's what people (98:29 - 98:33)
want to play and hey uh people aren't (98:30 - 98:34)
going to be people have to buy my game (98:33 - 98:36)
to play it and I need that money to live (98:34 - 98:38)
as a developer I'm probably not going to (98:36 - 98:40)
make it for 3DS because I don't I can't (98:38 - 98:42)
run that risk of people dumping my ROM (98:40 - 98:44)
and then just playing it for free like (98:42 - 98:46)
that's not worth my time so yeah just (98:44 - 98:48)
something to think about we have so many (98:46 - 98:50)
emails I feel so bad I'm like slowly (98:48 - 98:53)
cutting some out let's (98:50 - 98:57)
do this one it's kind of long uh but (98:53 - 99:00)
really awesome uh relle writes in from (98:57 - 99:03)
Davenport Iowa I first wanted to start (99:00 - 99:06)
out with my email I first want to start (99:03 - 99:10)
my email out with I really like everyone (99:06 - 99:13)
on this show equally the amount of (99:10 - 99:16)
flection is so parallel in fact that if (99:13 - 99:19)
I were told I could only bring one of (99:16 - 99:21)
you with me to a desert island for (99:19 - 99:22)
company would have to go alone because (99:21 - 99:25)
choosing would be impossible o I like (99:22 - 99:27)
Travis (99:25 - 99:30)
best I like this new will who actually (99:27 - 99:32)
likes me as a human (99:30 - 99:34)
being7 strikes again with that being (99:32 - 99:36)
said in your last episode you talked (99:34 - 99:38)
about forming a bond with your Pokemon (99:36 - 99:40)
you play through the game and I wanted (99:38 - 99:42)
to comment on that I have finished (99:40 - 99:44)
playing through both sun and moon and (99:42 - 99:47)
trying to fill my Pokedex but sun has (99:44 - 99:51)
brought me a my few new favorite Pokémon (99:47 - 99:53)
Sylveon now hear me out I know it's from (99:51 - 99:56)
Gen 6 but here is why I'm the type of (99:53 - 99:58)
non-competitive player that enjoys (99:56 - 100:00)
forming a strategy by mapping out my (99:58 - 100:02)
team and moves I've been playing the (100:00 - 100:06)
game since I was N9 now 29 when the (100:02 - 100:08)
first ones came out on my crappy Game (100:06 - 100:12)
Boy I tried to use at least five of the (100:08 - 100:14)
current games generate games gen of (100:12 - 100:17)
Pokemon so I don't get used to the same (100:14 - 100:21)
exact Team every time one of the Gen six (100:17 - 100:23)
guys I really wanted was (100:21 - 100:27)
salazzle it as its speed and typing (100:23 - 100:30)
intrigued me however only a female (100:27 - 100:34)
sandal salandit sand salandit will (100:30 - 100:37)
evolve into salazzle and apparently are (100:34 - 100:40)
rare so I knew that ahead of time on my (100:37 - 100:43)
way to WETA volcano I came across a wild (100:40 - 100:46)
Eevee and it's hard for me to personally (100:43 - 100:48)
pass up Eevee so I caught it and played (100:46 - 100:51)
with it for a while I wasn't super up to (100:48 - 100:52)
date on how Eevee evolves into its (100:51 - 100:54)
newest Evolutions but apparently with (100:52 - 100:56)
enough happiness and leveling up and at (100:54 - 100:58)
least one fairy typ move that thing (100:56 - 101:01)
evolved into Sylveon before I knew it it (100:58 - 101:03)
was a male Sylveon and I love the fact (101:01 - 101:05)
that it was such a girly designed (101:03 - 101:09)
Pokemon was a dude I named it a tray you (101:05 - 101:11)
after the movie not the (101:09 - 101:14)
band uh the movie would be uh the never- (101:11 - 101:18)
Ending Story so oh okay good uh which I (101:14 - 101:20)
believe the band is named after the lead (101:18 - 101:22)
character from that movie so is that the (101:20 - 101:24)
dragon that's not the dragon uh at Tru I (101:22 - 101:29)
think is The Boy The Boy oh okay yeah uh (101:24 - 101:31)
um don't I'm not 100% certain but I (101:29 - 101:33)
think atrau is the boy once at the (101:31 - 101:36)
volcano I was having an instantly hard (101:33 - 101:38)
time trying to find a female salandit so (101:36 - 101:41)
I decided to Google to see what other (101:38 - 101:43)
players have have done legit one of the (101:41 - 101:46)
ways someone said to find this was to (101:43 - 101:49)
find a male EV a male Eevee with cute (101:46 - 101:52)
charm evolve it into simp Sylveon put at (101:49 - 101:54)
the top of your party it will attract (101:52 - 101:56)
the Pokémon of the opposite sex (101:54 - 101:58)
therefore finding a female salandit I (101:56 - 102:01)
found my female sanet after the first (101:58 - 102:03)
try another thing that Drew me to my (102:01 - 102:05)
male Sylveon with cute charm is that (102:03 - 102:08)
during the Elite 4 battle in Sun it (102:05 - 102:10)
somehow was lucky enough to use its cute (102:08 - 102:13)
charm almost on every female Pokemon oh (102:10 - 102:16)
this this Sylveon was a stood uh making (102:13 - 102:19)
my making my battle through them and (102:16 - 102:22)
into the champion feet way easier than (102:19 - 102:24)
it should have been I have become very (102:22 - 102:27)
very fond of this fabulous looking male (102:24 - 102:29)
Sylveon with its cute charm and it's (102:27 - 102:32)
definitely a keeper forever anyways love (102:29 - 102:35)
the show you guys are awesome relle what (102:32 - 102:37)
was I mean was there a question in there (102:35 - 102:39)
there was at some point but I don't I (102:37 - 102:41)
think there was at the top I think near (102:39 - 102:43)
the beginning I think there was a (102:41 - 102:44)
question I like the story but I think (102:43 - 102:45)
there was a question that we are all (102:44 - 102:48)
forgetting nope no question the the only (102:45 - 102:50)
thing the only comment I have is that (102:48 - 102:53)
like you know Sylveon the (102:50 - 102:56)
only I like one of the reason yeah I do (102:53 - 102:58)
too but one of the reasons that you (102:56 - 103:00)
might consider it like girly and (102:58 - 103:02)
feminine is because it's pink and well I (103:00 - 103:05)
guess it's the ribbons too but you know (103:02 - 103:07)
honestly pink was originally considered (103:05 - 103:10)
to be a men's color it's kind of like a (103:07 - 103:14)
fake gender ification of a handsome (103:10 - 103:18)
Pokemon of whatever sort I will say the (103:14 - 103:21)
the story does remind me how much of of (103:18 - 103:24)
how much I like the move attract where (103:21 - 103:27)
it's kind of like confusion but it it (103:24 - 103:29)
obviously based off male or female but (103:27 - 103:32)
I'm a big fan of like paralyze it okay (103:29 - 103:34)
now confuse it okay now attract all (103:32 - 103:35)
right now you have like a 2% chance of (103:34 - 103:37)
attacking you're the worst is what (103:35 - 103:39)
you're saying yeah oh yeah (103:37 - 103:42)
definitely and then you use and then you (103:39 - 103:44)
use something with Serene Grace and a (103:42 - 103:45)
move (103:44 - 103:48)
that Zen has a chance to Flinch yeah (103:45 - 103:50)
cool so you're the worst human being (103:48 - 103:53)
yeah good I'm glad we established that (103:50 - 103:55)
uh okay another relle double we got (103:53 - 103:58)
relle is back to back all right so relle (103:55 - 104:01)
from Denver Colorado to the coolest pod (103:58 - 104:04)
Coast podcast hosts around pod Coast to (104:01 - 104:08)
Coast pod Coast this this another long (104:04 - 104:10)
email long time listener first time (104:08 - 104:13)
caller unless you count slack I guess I (104:10 - 104:15)
thought about writing in probably a (104:13 - 104:17)
thousand times I've finally been pushed (104:15 - 104:19)
over the edge I did it I wrote you an (104:17 - 104:21)
email here's what prompted me to write (104:19 - 104:24)
in on a recent episode you talked about (104:21 - 104:26)
your Twitter handle I did not get your (104:24 - 104:28)
Twitter handle at all until that episode (104:26 - 104:30)
follow boy is my favorite though but for (104:28 - 104:33)
at least 100 episodes of the show every (104:30 - 104:34)
time you said your Twitter handle I (104:33 - 104:37)
thought you were saying dredging a lake (104:34 - 104:39)
wrong every time I heard it I thought (104:37 - 104:43)
spj sure says sunny says funny things (104:39 - 104:45)
sometimes uh and also it's a weird (104:43 - 104:48)
handle but whatever and move on it (104:45 - 104:50)
wasn't until you actually spelled it out (104:48 - 104:52)
that one time time that I realized I was (104:50 - 104:54)
the one who had it wrong the whole time (104:52 - 104:58)
hearing is is weird words are hard uh (104:54 - 105:01)
this is probably so much funnier to me (104:58 - 105:02)
than it is to you but your discussion (105:01 - 105:04)
totally reminded me of this and I (105:02 - 105:06)
thought I would share a story about your (105:04 - 105:09)
Twitter account anyways I wanted to say (105:06 - 105:11)
thank you for all the hard work you do (105:09 - 105:13)
for all the amazing content you make and (105:11 - 105:16)
for the awesome Community you've (105:13 - 105:18)
supported around everything you do (105:16 - 105:21)
everyone is always writing in about how (105:18 - 105:22)
much they love Travis and will and I (105:21 - 105:24)
feel like you don't get enough Praise (105:22 - 105:26)
You Deserve sometimes so I wanted to let (105:24 - 105:27)
you know that you are my favorite (105:26 - 105:30)
podcast host will and Trav deserve is a (105:27 - 105:31)
strong (105:30 - 105:35)
word will and Travis are great but but (105:31 - 105:37)
you always make me smile and I always (105:35 - 105:40)
enjoy hearing what you have to say no (105:37 - 105:43)
exceptions even when it's stuff we Prett (105:40 - 105:45)
pretty strongly disagree on like game (105:43 - 105:48)
plot lines and what to call games and a (105:45 - 105:52)
lot of other things I'm sure also and my (105:48 - 105:54)
wonderful friend Irene assumes that you (105:52 - 105:57)
are pretty cool outside the podcast too (105:54 - 105:59)
so I feel that it is confident in saying (105:57 - 106:02)
you're one cool dude and probably the (105:59 - 106:05)
awesome podcast host in my opinion on a (106:02 - 106:09)
scale of 1 to eight definitely about a (106:05 - 106:12)
seven on a more serious note I (106:09 - 106:13)
especially wanted to thank you for your (106:12 - 106:16)
social commentary you all did on sun and (106:13 - 106:18)
moon I know you caught a bit of flack (106:16 - 106:20)
but those kinds of things are really (106:18 - 106:22)
important and kids do really pick up on (106:20 - 106:24)
this kind of stuff for example here is (106:22 - 106:26)
my own piece of commentary on Pokemon in (106:24 - 106:29)
general that I've always been aware of (106:26 - 106:32)
SL since I was a young kid it is (106:29 - 106:34)
certainly not perfect but Pokemon is one (106:32 - 106:36)
of the most gender balanc games I know (106:34 - 106:39)
of across all of Pokémon media women are (106:36 - 106:42)
rep are presented in a wonderful variety (106:39 - 106:44)
of characters in careers and are often (106:42 - 106:48)
shown in positions of power in the show (106:44 - 106:50)
you had characters of authority like (106:48 - 106:52)
officer Jenny and Nurse Joy who are (106:50 - 106:54)
universally respected regardless of (106:52 - 106:56)
being women you have also had evil teams (106:54 - 106:58)
of women Gym Leaders store owners and a (106:56 - 107:00)
couple professors and girls who were (106:58 - 107:03)
just out in the world training Pokemon (107:00 - 107:05)
like boys were and no one even (107:03 - 107:07)
questioned them being there it mostly (107:05 - 107:10)
just felt natural because girls can do (107:07 - 107:12)
the same stuff as boys so what's the (107:10 - 107:14)
problem you know and looking at the (107:12 - 107:16)
games we have a ton of female trainers (107:14 - 107:18)
and trainer classes of women and (107:16 - 107:21)
especially important is for your (107:18 - 107:24)
statistical pleasure 43% of Gym Leaders (107:21 - 107:27)
SLT trial cabinet captains SL kahunas (107:24 - 107:31)
and 48% of Elite 4 members are women (107:27 - 107:33)
those are good stats I like those and a (107:31 - 107:35)
little disappointing but 30% of (107:33 - 107:38)
Champions are women if you count koui (107:35 - 107:41)
and red with skewing towards the later (107:38 - 107:43)
generations these are people who are (107:41 - 107:45)
important and Powerful in the Pokémon (107:43 - 107:47)
world and it was almost common to see (107:45 - 107:49)
women in the roles as men no question (107:47 - 107:51)
that they were fit to be be there and (107:49 - 107:53)
it's kind of amazing that every piece of (107:51 - 107:55)
children's media I cons consumed in my (107:53 - 107:58)
youth Sans perhaps Sailor Moon this is (107:55 - 108:01)
the most representational of my gender (107:58 - 108:05)
that I had as a kid and having fictional (108:01 - 108:07)
roles like the Elite 4 members who could (108:05 - 108:09)
be the best SL strongest people in the (108:07 - 108:12)
world without people questioning their (108:09 - 108:13)
worthiness of them being there was (108:12 - 108:15)
incredibly inspirational and important (108:13 - 108:18)
to me this is why this is a huge part of (108:15 - 108:20)
why Pokémon has always meant so much to (108:18 - 108:23)
me and and why I've never really left it (108:20 - 108:25)
I'm always kind of disappointed when (108:23 - 108:27)
people especially people that aren't (108:25 - 108:28)
from the groups that being spoken about (108:27 - 108:30)
don't want to talk about these things or (108:28 - 108:31)
say that these things don't really (108:30 - 108:33)
matter because kids don't know what it (108:31 - 108:35)
means because that is not exactly true (108:33 - 108:37)
when Chris became the first female (108:35 - 108:40)
player character in Crystal I was aware (108:37 - 108:42)
of it and it was absurdly important to (108:40 - 108:44)
me and I've been told all the times that (108:42 - 108:45)
girls weren't supposed to play Pokémon (108:44 - 108:47)
because your character is a boy so you (108:45 - 108:49)
have to play you have to be a boy to (108:47 - 108:52)
play being being able to play as a girl (108:49 - 108:54)
not only allowed me to feel more (108:52 - 108:55)
represented and connected to the games (108:54 - 108:58)
but it also gave me a tool to fight back (108:55 - 108:59)
against bullies if Chris could be a (108:58 - 109:01)
Pokemon trainer that meant I could be (108:59 - 109:03)
too and so they couldn't put me down (109:01 - 109:05)
anymore and I was aware of these things (109:03 - 109:07)
as a kid other kids were aware of these (109:05 - 109:09)
things I do really think people sell (109:07 - 109:12)
kids short a lot of the time I may not (109:09 - 109:14)
have known that this was sexism at this (109:12 - 109:16)
age but I knew that others could (109:14 - 109:18)
couldn't but I knew others thought I (109:16 - 109:20)
couldn't do things because I was a girl (109:18 - 109:23)
like the children in the Clark dolls (109:20 - 109:25)
experiments might have not understood (109:23 - 109:27)
why they were exhibiting internal racism (109:25 - 109:30)
but they knew the difference between the (109:27 - 109:32)
way people viewed white people and black (109:30 - 109:34)
people the labels might not be there but (109:32 - 109:36)
the concepts definitely are and (109:34 - 109:38)
pretending they aren't impacting kids (109:36 - 109:41)
and honestly adults too is just baffling (109:38 - 109:44)
to me almost done here uh like these (109:41 - 109:46)
things are important and shape the way (109:44 - 109:48)
we view the world and others so yeah I (109:46 - 109:50)
think I I think that y all took the the (109:48 - 109:52)
time to address social issues in media (109:50 - 109:54)
that were incredibly important and (109:52 - 109:56)
wonderful I deeply appreciate it and I (109:54 - 109:57)
know a lot of other people did too I (109:56 - 109:59)
wanted to thank you for that from the (109:57 - 110:01)
bottom of my heart even if it's a (109:59 - 110:03)
billion years too late and also a (110:01 - 110:06)
billion words too long in later news (110:03 - 110:09)
what's with all the grass starter hate I (110:06 - 110:11)
love grass starter Pokémon they are (110:09 - 110:12)
sweet and wonderful Pokemon I love (110:11 - 110:14)
oodles and bunches my car is named (110:12 - 110:17)
Torterra I love torta and for these (110:14 - 110:19)
reasons you all seem to pick on the (110:17 - 110:21)
Pokémon I love the number one thing that (110:19 - 110:22)
makes me yell at my iPod when I'm (110:21 - 110:26)
listening give these Pokemon a break the (110:22 - 110:28)
commentary is lighthearted don't let me (110:26 - 110:30)
into that I was the one defending chi I (110:28 - 110:31)
mean I realized you didn't mention (110:30 - 110:33)
Chikorita specifically but I was (110:31 - 110:35)
defending Chikorita I love rowlet I love (110:33 - 110:37)
The Twig line don't letum me in with (110:35 - 110:39)
these (110:37 - 110:41)
losers uh also for the record I think (110:39 - 110:43)
licorice is gross regardless of the (110:41 - 110:45)
brand and carbonated drinks are awful (110:43 - 110:48)
keep doing what you are doing Miss relle (110:45 - 110:51)
Delaney Pokey sister long time ISC fan (110:48 - 110:54)
captain of Team buddy sore Defenders of (110:51 - 110:57)
unloved Pokemon PS quick right now if (110:54 - 110:58)
you are reading this give Irena high (110:57 - 111:01)
five and tell her she's the best woo (110:58 - 111:03)
long email I I'm pretty certain there (111:01 - 111:05)
was no question in there I mean the (111:03 - 111:07)
question was at the end you well you (111:05 - 111:08)
gotta you can't love everything right (111:07 - 111:10)
you gota you got to put was that a (111:08 - 111:13)
question or just like a uh what are (111:10 - 111:16)
those questions that answer themselves (111:13 - 111:19)
uh uhal rical out of all the starter (111:16 - 111:22)
Pokemon you got to somebody has to be at (111:19 - 111:23)
the bottom right and so that's why I put (111:22 - 111:26)
Chikorita there okay I wouldn't say it (111:23 - 111:27)
as somebody has to be at the bottom (111:26 - 111:30)
because that logically actually does not (111:27 - 111:32)
make any sense at all what I would say (111:30 - 111:34)
yeah like rate you rate all the the the (111:32 - 111:37)
starter Pokemon event when you make a (111:34 - 111:39)
list somebody has to be at the bottom (111:37 - 111:41)
you're creating an artificial scale and (111:39 - 111:44)
therefore placing (111:41 - 111:47)
scale exactly but this is what I would (111:44 - 111:50)
say which has more of a a how value is (111:47 - 111:55)
created in our emotional experience that (111:50 - 111:59)
we can't enjoy specifically the Pokemon (111:55 - 112:02)
that we do enjoy and love if there (111:59 - 112:04)
aren't other Pokemon that we do not (112:02 - 112:06)
enjoy and love as much as the ones that (112:04 - 112:08)
we do and a lot of course everyone is (112:06 - 112:11)
allowed to have their preference I can (112:08 - 112:14)
be your angle or your (112:11 - 112:20)
devil what that Meme is beyond me but um (112:14 - 112:22)
just yes happiness has no value without (112:20 - 112:26)
sadness Joy has no value without pain (112:22 - 112:28)
the Pokemon you love has minimal to (112:26 - 112:31)
little value without the Pokemon you (112:28 - 112:34)
hate to compare it against so that's you (112:31 - 112:36)
know it's a fundamental rule of the (112:34 - 112:38)
reality we live in we we we live in a in (112:36 - 112:42)
a world of contrasts not a a flat plane (112:38 - 112:45)
of everything being equal hi let's talk (112:42 - 112:48)
about dialectics for a little bit people (112:45 - 112:49)
enjoy it when you talk about philosophy (112:48 - 112:53)
so let's go right ahead no I'm not I (112:49 - 112:56)
mean look when I was when I was a young (112:53 - 112:59)
boy I played Pokemon Blue and my sister (112:56 - 113:02)
played Pokemon Red and it was a great (112:59 - 113:04)
time and my sister eventually fell out (113:02 - 113:07)
of Pokemon Red about halfway through (113:04 - 113:09)
mostly because of the difficulty but my (113:07 - 113:11)
mom picked it up and playing with (113:09 - 113:13)
Pokemon with my mom was a very like (113:11 - 113:16)
great and very fond memory that I had (113:13 - 113:18)
and I never never really like thought (113:16 - 113:21)
like oh Pokemon's a boy game right I (113:18 - 113:23)
guess I had a cool mom she might not be (113:21 - 113:25)
cool anymore but when I was growing up (113:23 - 113:28)
she played golden eye she played Mario (113:25 - 113:31)
Kart she played like Lego Racers she (113:28 - 113:34)
played Super Mario 64 like she played a (113:31 - 113:37)
lot of games with me and so that was (113:34 - 113:40)
like a big influence of like not only do (113:37 - 113:42)
I have somebody to play games with but (113:40 - 113:44)
my mom plays video games that's really (113:42 - 113:46)
cool but no it was a really great email (113:44 - 113:49)
yeah I the only thing I can really think (113:46 - 113:52)
of to to say is is we we've definitely (113:49 - 113:54)
gotten emails in that that are like I (113:52 - 113:56)
don't know why you guys are being so (113:54 - 113:58)
serious about all this Pokemon is just a (113:56 - 114:01)
kids game and I always think well then (113:58 - 114:03)
why are you listening to like three (114:01 - 114:05)
grown adults talk about Pokemon if it's (114:03 - 114:07)
just a kids game like what are you here (114:05 - 114:10)
for then I don't (114:07 - 114:13)
understand but uh you know to to each (114:10 - 114:15)
their own right like there are plenty of (114:13 - 114:17)
other Pokemon podcasts that are are not (114:15 - 114:19)
serious and you know sometimes we get (114:17 - 114:21)
serious and I I think that's okay like (114:19 - 114:22)
that's it's it's our show we can talk (114:21 - 114:24)
about what we want and I think the (114:22 - 114:26)
emails that we get addressing that (114:24 - 114:29)
saying thank you like those emails are (114:26 - 114:30)
are make everything we talk about worth (114:29 - 114:32)
it right you know some people listen to (114:30 - 114:35)
it and and they forget about it two days (114:32 - 114:36)
later because they've moved on to the (114:35 - 114:37)
next podcast and then some people listen (114:36 - 114:39)
to it and it means a lot to them and you (114:37 - 114:41)
know it's all worth it at the end of the (114:39 - 114:43)
day uh but yeah thank you guys for rting (114:41 - 114:44)
in we'll do one more we'll just do a (114:43 - 114:46)
quick short one I we had so many emails (114:44 - 114:48)
this week and this I don't want this (114:46 - 114:49)
podcast to draw on too long but this one (114:48 - 114:53)
is from Rodney from Fort Simpson Canada (114:49 - 114:54)
I don't believe that's a real place but (114:53 - 114:57)
okay do any of you write fan fiction or (114:54 - 115:00)
Draw fan art about Pokemon also Snivy (114:57 - 115:02)
and shins are my favorite Pokemon Logan (115:00 - 115:08)
is the best Rodney hip I I I'd say (115:02 - 115:10)
Logan's tied with Travis I I have a a (115:08 - 115:13)
different fondness for I each of them I (115:10 - 115:15)
mean I'm not going to argue Logan's (115:13 - 115:17)
great Logan yeah awesome Logan's great (115:15 - 115:20)
he hasn't been on in such a long time (115:17 - 115:23)
I'm doing a fun side project with Logan (115:20 - 115:26)
long time Logan yeah I like how all our (115:23 - 115:28)
emails like start off or end with (115:26 - 115:30)
somebody being the best it's like we're (115:28 - 115:33)
all Pokemon and people are deciding it's (115:30 - 115:35)
become a tradition at this point you (115:33 - 115:37)
can't really write us an email without (115:35 - 115:40)
making explicit your feelings about the (115:37 - 115:42)
hosts of the program no I like it I like (115:40 - 115:44)
it a lot I don't write or (115:42 - 115:48)
draw anything regarding Pokemon but I (115:44 - 115:51)
like if you if if you want an artist (115:48 - 115:55)
Micah has drawn a fair share of Pokemon (115:51 - 115:58)
and he's very very talented in what what (115:55 - 115:59)
he (115:58 - 116:03)
does uh Logan is also an artist I think (115:59 - 116:05)
Logan has drawn his fair share of (116:03 - 116:07)
Pokemon but other than that I don't I I (116:05 - 116:10)
know that you two don't draw right I do (116:07 - 116:14)
not uh no I actually do have I have (116:10 - 116:16)
written a lot of um I mean I don't know (116:14 - 116:19)
if I would call it fanfic but I will say (116:16 - 116:21)
Pokemon genre writing but I'm not going (116:19 - 116:23)
to tell people where they can find it (116:21 - 116:27)
that's for me and my readers to enjoy if (116:23 - 116:28)
you've read it I'm glad to have (116:27 - 116:31)
entertained you if you haven't found it (116:28 - 116:32)
keep looking (116:31 - 116:36)
friends I my writing has never been (116:32 - 116:38)
writing sorry I should be explicit (116:36 - 116:41)
writing fiction has never been that (116:38 - 116:44)
significant of a creative Outlet in my (116:41 - 116:47)
life my writing has almost exclusively (116:44 - 116:50)
been non-fiction stuff and then my other (116:47 - 116:54)
creative Outlets are like photography (116:50 - 116:58)
which is difficult to uh difficult to (116:54 - 117:02)
make about Pokemon I suppose and uh and (116:58 - 117:06)
uh to some extent uh doing some sort of (117:02 - 117:08)
audio experiments that I don't really (117:06 - 117:10)
share with anyone none none of that (117:08 - 117:14)
Pokemon related uh and then also the (117:10 - 117:17)
only one that that I have done that is (117:14 - 117:20)
somewhat Pokemon related is uh (117:17 - 117:24)
I DM a lot of or GM a lot of role (117:20 - 117:26)
playing game campaigns and that's sort (117:24 - 117:28)
of a creative Outlet in and of itself (117:26 - 117:31)
where you're essentially writing a book (117:28 - 117:34)
but you don't have any you don't have (117:31 - 117:37)
control over the actions of the main (117:34 - 117:39)
characters it's like writing a book (117:37 - 117:41)
where the main characters are real (117:39 - 117:42)
people that can make decisions that you (117:41 - 117:44)
don't expect so it's sort of a strange (117:42 - 117:49)
exercise but uh I did run a Pokemon (117:44 - 117:50)
themed (117:49 - 117:53)
one shot of 13th age once that was (117:50 - 117:57)
pretty fun but nothing substantial or (117:53 - 118:00)
large with that again thank you all for (117:57 - 118:01)
writing in I (118:00 - 118:03)
apologize if I have not gotten to your (118:01 - 118:06)
email I will keep these flagged for next (118:03 - 118:09)
week though uh but if you have any if (118:06 - 118:11)
you want to send in an email stories (118:09 - 118:13)
questions anything Pokemon or (118:11 - 118:16)
non-pokemon related uh (118:13 - 118:21)
SBJ P kmn CA (118:16 - 118:23)
st.com or uh you can hit the contact (118:21 - 118:26)
button on Pokemon podcast.com both (118:23 - 118:28)
emails go to the same place and I read (118:26 - 118:30)
every single one of them whether or not (118:28 - 118:32)
I read them on the show is a different (118:30 - 118:33)
story but I I read them all when they (118:32 - 118:36)
come in and uh I appreciate them I'm (118:33 - 118:38)
going to toss it over to Travis uh all (118:36 - 118:40)
these emails have killed my voice so I'm (118:38 - 118:41)
going to take a break Travis is going to (118:40 - 118:43)
give you your Pokemon of the week and (118:41 - 118:44)
then we're going to do some house (118:43 - 118:48)
cleaning uh after that so take it away (118:44 - 118:51)
Travis B of the week this week is Raichu (118:48 - 118:53)
and of course because we have been (118:51 - 118:57)
talking about VGC legal Pokemon of (118:53 - 118:59)
course we are talking about alola and (118:57 - 119:03)
Raichu as you can only use Pokemon that (118:59 - 119:05)
were forged in (119:03 - 119:09)
alola the two sets this week come from (119:05 - 119:12)
Brandon Weisner and Drew Coxwell of the (119:09 - 119:14)
Pokemon of the week slack Channel both (119:12 - 119:17)
are fairly similar but do have some (119:14 - 119:19)
distinct differences I'll run down those (119:17 - 119:20)
differences after (119:19 - 119:23)
I just read him through so the first one (119:20 - 119:27)
from Brandon Weisner is alolan Raichu (119:23 - 119:30)
with psychom Z the its signature ability (119:27 - 119:34)
surge Surfer with four EVS in HP 252 in (119:30 - 119:37)
special attack and 252 in speed a timid (119:34 - 119:40)
nature move set of psychic Thunderbolt (119:37 - 119:44)
fake out and then for the final move (119:40 - 119:47)
it's up to you either Encore or protect (119:44 - 119:51)
Drew coxwells set is similar we still (119:47 - 119:53)
have Tim in nature and we still have 252 (119:51 - 119:56)
in speed and special attack with four of (119:53 - 119:58)
the leftover Eves in HP the item is (119:56 - 120:00)
different this time we're going to do a (119:58 - 120:03)
focus Sash and then the moves are going (120:00 - 120:07)
to be fake out volt switch Encore and (120:03 - 120:09)
psychic so very similar move set as well (120:07 - 120:13)
but the differentiation between Focus (120:09 - 120:17)
Sash and psychium Z does illuminate that (120:13 - 120:19)
there are some differences in what you (120:17 - 120:23)
want this Pokemon to do with a focus (120:19 - 120:27)
sash you are more likely trying (120:23 - 120:30)
to because Raichu doesn't have enough (120:27 - 120:31)
bulk to really be able to survive a lot (120:30 - 120:34)
of hits Focus sash allows you to at (120:31 - 120:37)
least get a few attacks in so that (120:34 - 120:40)
raichu's decent offensive output (120:37 - 120:43)
naturally which is augmented by (120:40 - 120:46)
presuming presumably you run tapu Coco (120:43 - 120:50)
with it um augmented by the surge Surfer (120:46 - 120:53)
ability which will double your speed so (120:50 - 120:56)
you can be almost guaranteed to go first (120:53 - 120:59)
barring increase priority so the ability (120:56 - 121:02)
to um add in at least one more attack (120:59 - 121:04)
with Focus sash is nice and then (121:02 - 121:09)
psychium Z on Brandon set shows that uh (121:04 - 121:10)
shows (121:09 - 121:16)
prioritizing being able to one hit KO a (121:10 - 121:18)
larger number of Pokemon with that (121:16 - 121:21)
powerful Z move as I sort of mentioned (121:18 - 121:24)
almost every alolan Raichu is going to (121:21 - 121:28)
be paired in a team with tapu Coco (121:24 - 121:30)
because of tapu Koco's ability which (121:28 - 121:34)
will cause electric terrain alolan (121:30 - 121:37)
raichu's ability surge Surfer doubles (121:34 - 121:40)
its speed in electric terrain I think a (121:37 - 121:42)
lot of folks thought that that duo would (121:40 - 121:46)
be a complete you know meta defining (121:42 - 121:50)
Powerhouse in VGC 27 17 just because (121:46 - 121:54)
it's so obviously synergistic I'm no (121:50 - 121:56)
expert but I would guess that the reason (121:54 - 121:57)
it doesn't really pan out that way is (121:56 - 121:59)
because it's turns out that tabuk Coco (121:57 - 122:03)
is kind of just good on its own and then (121:59 - 122:05)
doubling up with another electric type (122:03 - 122:09)
doesn't really allow you to do that much (122:05 - 122:11)
more right like tapu Coco is already (122:09 - 122:15)
near the top of the speed tier list of (122:11 - 122:19)
of Pokemon that are allowed in VGC so (122:15 - 122:23)
having basically slightly lesser but (122:19 - 122:26)
faster tapu Coco paired with it becomes (122:23 - 122:29)
a bit redundant but it still is a you (122:26 - 122:31)
know it still is a synergistic Duo and (122:29 - 122:33)
the psychic typing can come in handy (122:31 - 122:36)
especially if fake out as well access to (122:33 - 122:38)
the fake out is very important in (122:36 - 122:40)
doubles but it seems like it's not (122:38 - 122:43)
panned out completely well for it to (122:40 - 122:46)
become like I said something Central to (122:43 - 122:50)
The Meta but it's not entirely un viable (122:46 - 122:53)
either it's it's pretty powerful but I (122:50 - 122:56)
think not as powerful as people expected (122:53 - 122:58)
if you want a Shiny Raichu it is going (122:56 - 123:01)
to be orange instead of like a brownish (122:58 - 123:03)
yellow it's going to be like a burnt (123:01 - 123:06)
orange uh no other Pokemon have no other (123:03 - 123:09)
Pokemon has the same tip combination of (123:06 - 123:12)
as alolan Raichu in Pokemon Red and Blue (123:09 - 123:14)
there is a scientist at the Pokémon lab (123:12 - 123:16)
in cinear island who will trade you a (123:14 - 123:19)
Raichu for an electrode if the player (123:16 - 123:22)
talks to him after the trade he will (123:19 - 123:24)
mention that the Raichu evolved which is (123:22 - 123:26)
not possible this mistake was due to an (123:24 - 123:28)
original translation eror of the script (123:26 - 123:30)
in Japanese blue in which a person (123:28 - 123:33)
traded a graler for a cadabra rather (123:30 - 123:35)
than in Pokemon red and green this error (123:33 - 123:39)
was corrected in fire red and leaf green (123:35 - 123:41)
right shu's fire red and Sun Pokedex (123:39 - 123:43)
entries reference a (123:41 - 123:46)
1903 documentary film called (123:43 - 123:48)
electrocuting the elephant by Thomas (123:46 - 123:51)
Edison several pokeddex entries claim (123:48 - 123:54)
Raichu can just discharge up to 100,000 (123:51 - 123:58)
volts however its Stadium entry claims (123:54 - 124:01)
it can only discharge up to 10,000 volts (123:58 - 124:03)
this is likely a translation error due (124:01 - 124:05)
to the way numbers are read in Japanese (124:03 - 124:09)
where 100,000 literally reads 10 10,000s (124:05 - 124:11)
Raichu has appeared in every Regional (124:09 - 124:14)
Pokedex except the Unova pokedex (124:11 - 124:16)
although Pikachu is the starter Pokémon (124:14 - 124:18)
of yellow it is not possible to directly (124:16 - 124:21)
evolve in the game it must be traded in (124:18 - 124:23)
from red and blue the inability to (124:21 - 124:26)
evolve Pikachu is a reference to Ash's (124:23 - 124:29)
Pikachu in the anime and finally Raichu (124:26 - 124:31)
and its pre-evolved form share their (124:29 - 124:35)
category with rata ricade sandrew and (124:31 - 124:38)
sand slash they're all known as the (124:35 - 124:41)
mouse Pokemon Digimon wait I thought it (124:38 - 124:45)
was the El wasn't Pikachu like electric (124:41 - 124:47)
rodent isn't that what it's (124:45 - 124:50)
species Pikachu no I think Pikachu is (124:47 - 124:52)
just a mouse Pokemon uh is it the (124:50 - 124:55)
electric Mouse Pokemon or is it just the (124:52 - 124:56)
mouse no it's just it's just Mouse (124:55 - 125:00)
Pokemon oh wow and uh and also let's not (124:56 - 125:01)
participate in revisionist history that (125:00 - 125:04)
was in no way a (125:01 - 125:04)
documentary was that part of the Edison (125:04 - 125:11)
and Tesla AC was that part of the like (125:08 - 125:15)
Tesla versus DC do we do we go into it (125:11 - 125:18)
cuz it's we weird bubble ped needs to (125:15 - 125:20)
fix their though their ads are still (125:18 - 125:25)
running rampant they're everywhere (125:20 - 125:29)
um look guys edia I love you but get (125:25 - 125:31)
your ad situation under control I know (125:29 - 125:33)
some of you listen wait so I don't (125:31 - 125:36)
actually I don't see any at hold on I (125:33 - 125:39)
don't think I'm running anything like ad (125:36 - 125:41)
blocker or anything but I don't see any (125:39 - 125:44)
ads when I'm on Bulbapedia for some (125:41 - 125:46)
reason yeah I only got the little one at (125:44 - 125:49)
the bottom then then o those like three (125:46 - 125:51)
at the top oh boy it's like the longer (125:49 - 125:53)
you stay on the page like then they come (125:51 - 125:55)
out of then they start getting out of (125:53 - 125:57)
control yeah so I I don't have I I (125:55 - 126:00)
checked and I made sure and I actually (125:57 - 126:02)
deleted you are you paying bedia sweet (126:00 - 126:05)
sweet cash to hide ads I don't think so (126:02 - 126:08)
if I am I should stop I don't think they (126:05 - 126:10)
have that option I'm going to log out (126:08 - 126:12)
and see what happens maybe uh all right (126:10 - 126:14)
Travis logs out let's do a little bit of (126:12 - 126:17)
house cleaning and there are the ads (126:14 - 126:20)
found them oh interesting good to know (126:17 - 126:22)
maybe I'll log in more often then uh a (126:20 - 126:24)
little bit of house cleaning here is we (126:22 - 126:28)
have a [ __ ] zip shirt I I can't even (126:24 - 126:31)
recreate how I said it I Know Travis was (126:28 - 126:34)
there at the time (126:31 - 126:34)
and there you go just like that that was (126:34 - 126:41)
that debuted in in episode 149 I think (126:38 - 126:43)
it's around the 40 minute Mark I could (126:41 - 126:46)
be wrong but I do know the episode's (126:43 - 126:49)
149 so we have a [ __ ] zip shirt on t (126:46 - 126:53)
tepring uh and also a hoodie to go along (126:49 - 126:55)
with it and those will be up for by the (126:53 - 126:57)
time you're listening to this another (126:55 - 127:01)
week and uh yeah go ahead and back go (126:57 - 127:02)
ahead and order one of those if you if (127:01 - 127:05)
you want to I think you you'll get them (127:02 - 127:08)
early March if I'm not mistaken but uh (127:05 - 127:10)
people were asking for more shirts I I (127:08 - 127:14)
made more shirts so you [ __ ] zip it up if (127:10 - 127:16)
you're looking for the links they are on (127:14 - 127:17)
uh if you're looking for the links they (127:16 - 127:19)
are on Twitter and and Facebook and (127:17 - 127:22)
whatnot it's a really cool shirt (127:19 - 127:24)
otherwise I think if you go to Teespring (127:22 - 127:26)
and you type in Pokemon it'll show up (127:24 - 127:28)
too Teespring and I don't get along i' (127:26 - 127:30)
I've I've done a lot of tried to do a (127:28 - 127:31)
