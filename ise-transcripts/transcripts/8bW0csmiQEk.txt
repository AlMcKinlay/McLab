[Music] so [Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 407 episode of the pokemon podcast it's super effective i'm your host sbj with me is will i have a lot to say i'm gonna keep it positive i i love you all but sometimes you guys don't think through the words that you use yes us no i mean our our listeners both of you i hate i'm sick and tired of both of you that's again oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah bobby i had higher hopes for our listening community why i i am so frustrated yes that's about you nate it's it's about a lot of things i think unite is the focus this week because people yeah greg also here i am here and i have discovered a new candy that i cannot resist key lime pie kitkats are amazing and i love them is there a chocolate component to them i mean it's a kitkat it's a kit kat that doesn't mean chocolate i don't i don't taste any chocolate in it it's basically key lime flavor and the kitkat parts like the crust it's really good i made a mistake we found them at we found them at costco and so i bought the 24 pack at costco so i have a giant box in my house and i am only allowed to eat one a day period that's like probably like two hundred and forty four hundred calories are you like breaking it off is it like one break i'm not a monster i'm eating the four fingers i'm eating the four figures of the cat and i break them individually and eat them unlike some people i know who just take a big bite across all four those are the true monsters no that is awful that it is outrageous unacceptable exactly yeah they're better than twix because twix is garbage twix is the only candy with the cookies yes kitkat has a cookie crunch cookie cat is not a cookie crust there cat is a wafer 100 correct but it crunches like a cookie that's like saying that the cookie crunch it's got the crunch like a cookie so the cookies no no a wafer does not crunch the same way as a cookie it's like drinking a bubbly and saying oh this is the same as drinking a soda no the experiences are vastly different i mean the flavors are different but i tell you the bubble that has caffeine tell me the difference between that and a cola apart from flavors should not exist category on jeopardy things that should not exist caffeinated bubbly caffeine is one of brent's favorite things wait is that a real thing yes isn't that just soda yes no it's soda without the sweetener until you follow will anderson's advice and put sweetener in it i mean diet diet soda has got some sweetener in it but you know you can put truvia in your bubbly you could put pure cane sugar in your bubbly if you want cnh piercing sugar from hawaii growing in the sun yeah i have issues with hawaiian sugar you have issues period yeah yes yes are we ready for our week's sponsor i don't know do we have the issues sponsored this week uh speaking of issues we got some pokemon news uh we got a lot of news this week so we're gonna focus on the big stuff and then we'll all forget about the little stuff next week and then other stuff will come in uh let's start with the ign article here titled pokemon live action series in development at netflix oh i saw that yeah written and produced by the co-showrunner of lucifer i'm not familiar big fan of that show how are you not familiar with lucifer because i don't watch tv uh it's because it got moved i think it was like on wb or yeah and it got moved to netflix and became a netflix series it did so since steve is not on my netflix account i'm certain he doesn't watch netflix and therefore hasn't seen it but i just don't watch tv that's the problem there's awesome do watch which which is really funny it's like i i also do not watch tv and the only programs that i have watched like in the last year are literally lucifer the good place i'm noticing a theme here except and also yugioh the original cartoon i mean how can you say that you don't watch tv when you when i have clearly been you and you have the property brothers and you say you watch a seinfeld or a simpson's episode true every night when you're going to bed how could you possibly stand there and spit these lies i don't think first off i put disenchantment on when i go to bed it's not it's never you've moved on from the simpsons what yeah i've moved on from the simpsons because i don't have a good way to put simpsons in my room anymore cause they put it on disney plus and i don't wanna pay for that wait why would the simpsons be i'm yeah it's on disney plus they own it it's on a z plus because fox disney owns i don't know okay i there was probably two episodes of disenchantment that was played last night before i went to bed i have no clue which episodes they were because i don't actually like look at the tv it's just like a nightlight because i'm scared of the dark that's what twitch is for no i don't that is what i don't want no no no because then you're you get engulfed in those conversations because it's live and it's not if you're not paying any attention and don't care what the person is saying aka me watching your stream i don't want any twitch garbage in my bedroom when i'm trying to sleep the last thing i want is for some like lo-fi streamer to raid some like heavy metal person and all of a sudden i'm having nightmares that ain't happening yeah you can't set a timer on twitch can you to turn itself off i guess you could set a timer on your tv is that do you listen to you listen to twitch when you go to bed who me yeah no i there's no tvs allowed in the bedroom period i mean i'm the same so what do you what do you do to to lull yourself to sleep i lie in the bed close my eyes and fall asleep wow i i in the past year have become uh addicted to calm sleep stories oh i've heard people use that i can't have somebody talking about the twitch problem i don't know what it is because i listen to those stories and i'm like i've got to hear the end i've got to find out what and i'd like i never never get to there are people talking in disenchantment yeah but i already know what they're going to say i can just ignore them i said you're not paying attention to them i've seen every episode like 50 times so it's not like even if i like picked up on a joke and i was like oh i know this joke is coming and like like chuckle and like my one eye open like barely asleep being like ah that joke's still funny like there's no anticipation because i know what's going to happen if i do look over like i i i know that's why simpsons was such a good sleeping mechanism because like i've seen them all i'm pretty sure there's like subreddits dedicated to like shows that help you sleep and we are future drama we are not going to the cesspool of advice that has read it yeah i think because also there's a violation of the number one rule of no tvs no screens in the bedroom no screens and tvs in the bedroom i've never had a problem with the tv in the bedroom like i'm just sleeping you'd be sleeping better without that tv right now you have no idea because you've never done it in situations like when you when i have to like stay at my like brother-in-law's house and it's like we got no tv in that room and now i'm just like listening to the wind when i could be listening to a different wind a wind called homer i have no problem like tv in the bedroom i'm always asleep within two episodes two 20-minute episodes you know i have action pokemon in the real world yeah i know tv in the bedroom i'm asleep within five minutes so no two episodes for me just i don't know because property brothers you're asleep in an episode as well yeah because i'm actively shutting my brain down from being forced to watch this terrible content i literally will knock myself out okay so back to the thing we were talking about according to variety henderson is slated to write and executive produce of the live adaptation uh he is currently the showrunner of netflix popular lucifer series based on a dc comic see this is why i've never seen lucifer i don't watch any dc thing batman well but it's not in the dc universe as far as i recall it's not i mean i mean in the comics it is but it's not in this tv reports say the series is aiming to replicate detective pikachu a 2019 live action pokemon movie starring ryan reynolds and justin smith however the netflix series will be its own independent production henderson also known for almost human has been serving as lucifer's co-show runner since 2016 when the series moved when it was picked up by netflix now it's one of the more popular revivals netflix has acquired from cable tv netflix is currently home to several existing pokemon anime series seasons and its interest to develop a live action series stems from the anime success on the streaming platform alongside acquiring more anime originals netflix is currently working to adapt several anime into live action shows including cowboy bebop and one piece the pokemon live action series no human will live long enough to be in a live action monday i mean they are setting themselves up for 17 years of paying these actors it's never gonna happen uh the live action series is very early in development so there are neither plot details nor casting places in plans currently so pikachu he's a detective plot done number one here's the question are they going to do murder no you don't know that do you there will be no murder you don't know there will be no murder there will be more crows i hate these early stages of tv slash movie development because like i can remember four or five years ago when we were talking about early detective pikachu before it was even detective pikachu i think and i feel like i guessed it on podcast or we had other people on and they were talking about how they want some pokemon journey but that's so hard to tell in 90 minutes a poke like detective pikachu worked because it was not a trainer's journey from point a to point b because they cut so much for that was in the game that made the game such a good story yeah they cut that cruise ship um [Music] i guess you could do a trainer's journey specifically in a tv show like the anime yeah i mean but they're but they're already but that's the thing they're already doing that so they just do it but not live action yeah they're just they're making a live action version of the tv the current anime yeah that's it no they're not i'm the new ash okay this is why i hate this conversation it's like it's like it's going to be like picard where it's like ash is like all old and retired and then all the all the people from the history of the pokemon world come to visit and bring their problems it's that feature when professor oak has sadly passed on and yeah and gary oak has to take over yes and ash is now that annoying neighbor so it's like a cobra kai oh i'm so into this now yeah yes it focuses on gary oak and it's like literally the the show is going to be called smell you later yeah and i'm into it yes well do you remember at the start of this podcast when you were like i'm disappointed with our listeners i'm disappointed with you two right now why there's like 9 million things in the pokemon world and anytime tv show or movie is mentioned people go right to ash and it's really frustrating we went to gary we went to gary not ash it is a television program of the gens they're going to pick which gen do you think they're going to pick and get the biggest audience i don't know better look there's this whole subplot where the poetry of professor oak's poetry is going to be collected and published it's like and then like that's the culmination of the of the the the honoring of the old professor oak at the end of like the first season because there will be unresolved issues where like ash is actually the bad guy now yeah and then uh so gary is like holding the fort at the pokemon research and then ash comes in and it's like they have to come together but you know in the background it's professor oak's poetry that's going to save everyone i'm into it this is the best show ever why doesn't hollywood pay me or us fine i'll share yeah thank you i'm just gonna move on this is uh you're the worst you're so i see the listeners that i'm disappointed in all of them right now are saying i would watch that yeah i would 100 watch that captain jeterson down below chewing on his thumb about what because you don't you don't you don't like good tv that's the problem well he doesn't watch tv so he has no say why would anyone like for years of listening to ash's the worst character people's first headspace go to like oh i can't wait for the live action movie with ash like it's just so contradictory [Music] a new champion yeah but if you don't relate it to the story that people know that they literally prove that with detective people that you do not need to relate it to the story that they need pikachu in it had a pikachu yeah there's only one pikachu in the entire universe correct so obv it's that one for somebody who said you liked the detective pikachu story did you miss the point where detective pikachu said hi to ash's pikachu in that game look pet aunt i'm explaining to you how the viewers go and are appealed and appeased yeah and you're looking for a specificity and look your mom's i'm not the whole point of me reading the article was not to be specific because there has been no actors and probably not even a script written we are probably just same thing with the detective pikachu too like there was rumors of that coming out sure they p they probably paid the money to uh lock in the possibility of doing it but that doesn't mean that it was ever going to happen but they wanted to finally hear that they had the greg and i have been asked to spec out a full season of gary oak smell you later yeah you pokemon trading card game v battle decks featuring dragon type pokemon rayquaza v and neu vern v uh these were announced uh and they will make it fun and easy to learn how to play the best-selling pokemon trading card game and they will be available on october 8th um there are two battle decks one featuring rayquaza one featuring neuvern uh this release follows the introduction of dragon type pokemon in the sword and shield series because we haven't seen dragon type pokemon since sun and moon uh and it will follow the tcg set involving skies which comes out next month or i guess this month it's august uh each deck will have the standard 60 cards the reference cards the rule book a play mat damn it i think it's the paper play mat i don't think it's a fancy one damage counters metallic coin deck box and a quick guide to help trainers learn winning strategies for clarification purpose you're getting both decks in one package so you can easily battle with friends and family they say so this is one of those situations where somebody i went to high school with buys this for their kids throws away the instructions and then calls me and says how do i play pokemon yes yes also it says it comes with eight additional trainer cards including two foil cards i'm not sure i don't know if those are promos or sideboard not sure do we know what they like have the cards been released like do we have no the only thing on the the this website the pokemon.com is just a screenshot of the noivern and rayquaza which are the they're those two pokemon come out in evolving skies they're both flying type dragons interesting although i believe raymond quasar would be a bit more powerful yes vastly superior okay this was um you know i expected like a pokemon announcement before august especially maybe one that involved sinnoh because they focused on cinno for july and they've been really good at announcing things on thursday but they didn't announce anything regarding diamond and pearl yet here we are here we are uh but they announced pokemon snap stuff i guess that's kind of cool i mean they can only have so many announcements at one time right that's right otherwise we would be overwhelmed during this 25th anniversary how would we stay on top of it i what's happening there like nothing nothing is happening there i i can't imagine there's not like we're doing a countdown and at the end of the countdown diamond and pearl are coming out and we announce diamond and pearl and we've only showed one thing of diamond which was on pokemon day that makes sense and then they're like galler alola callos and you're like wow that's so many months of no diamond and pearl and then they get to july and they're like cinnamon and you're like we have to at least get like 60 seconds of footage like it doesn't have to be long it's just you know show us a little something show yeah they can't do it they can't do it because people were so at odds about the whole chibi style it's like now anytime they show any gameplay footage of the chibi's style it's like flares the five m those embers will spark again and i hate the chibi and blah blah this sucks why couldn't they have cut and pay some sword and shield and improve the trees and they had so many opportunities blah blah blah i was like i don't have time for that noise you know what you guys complain so hard now just wait until the finished product i honestly thought you would at least get a trailer so yeah yeah august is hohen and then yeah september is johto and then october is kanto and then diamond and pearl like this is such a weird release i don't so i remember in 2016 when they announced sun and moon right yeah 20th anniversary very good sun and moon's five years old and they okay they they did the trailer for pokemon day or whatever where they at least announced it i remember them showing krebrawler off for the first time uh at the world championship but they were like showing at least new pokemon once a month or something they're like oh here's a pika pack here's a komala here's a rock ruff they were doing stuff is coming like consistently i felt like every week they were like hey this video game is coming the only thing they've announced for diamond pearl is hey we have a date no new stuff we just have a date do we think it's because bandai namco uses a different google cal and they've the intern has never synced the two up so there's the main pokemon calendar that they plan everything on the same weekend for and they asked bandai namco to submit all their dates and they said no it's on our google cal and it's just never shown up and so they're like well i guess they're not doing anything but it's on a different calendar that's it yep it's you know what it is it's it's it's like more insidious than that because they're like they're posting stuff to the calendar but it's like kind of like how when you use the apple calendar and it has like work and home right and it's like they they're not paying attention and they're putting it on home home and it's it's like i don't want to work here but this is home stuff well i don't even have the home checked off to look at i'm only looking at work i'm busy buy google accounts for work only put it on the work google i don't think it would be that weird if there wasn't like like if there wasn't this countdown if they didn't do like alola kalos you know like because they did this countdown i don't maybe i just had bad expectations you had bad expectations you you fell for the pattern like if they had no countdown and they didn't announce anything it would be like not as weird i think if well if it was like it's weird to say like we are having a whole sin a month don't you love people and turtwig and that other monkey thing don't you love these chips and then like we're making a new version of the things you love but we're not talking about it it's just it's very weird it's not like it's not bad i mean it's bad it is bad there is no information that is by definition in the 25th anniversary a bad thing to be doing it is bad it is bad that we are here it is bad that this is supposed to be a big anniversary here and literally nothing has happened we've gotten three unrelated songs that are of questionable quality we had an animated concert like five years ago yeah it was four minutes long mm-hmm well twelve we've had we've got one pokemon snap game that finally has that was very very good though that's not that's but that was the only thing they've done we got unite also very good it's also very good but they're gonna be fair to unite nothing to be with unite we got two really good pokemon games this year true and everyone now hates pokemon go wait a minute i don't hate pokemon go well they roll back all their covet stuff yeah i mean yeah it's bad okay surprise still don't hate pokemon go i don't hate pokemon go either people are very mad we do we're not talking about pokemon go no uh i understand why people are meant though um okay so let's say like for whatever reason they're like well we can't announce the diamond pro stuff we gotta announce the pokemon snap stuff it comes out on august 3rd it could have came out on august 10th i'm not sure if there's a really like i i don't see the snap lining up with anything otherwise so it's cool we got a little bit of free snap stuff people will probably come back for like a friday night saturday night and then forget about snap again that's fine though like i might i turned on my switch to play unite and something updated and i thought it was the snap thing and i'm like already i still don't know what updated because i literally thought it was snap and i have no idea which game in the list was the one that i actually updated i mean how many games do you have on your switch i don't know like too many i have katamari damacy i have darkness i have any updates trust me i have stardew valley which i refuse to play yeah listen harvesting conversations there's been way too many angry tangents already and we're only like 20 minutes in free content update for new pokemon snap it will start 6 p.m pdt they actually gave us a time this never happens what are they doing over there namco bandai you you these people over at bandai namco namco bandai they they have dates they have times yes they're they're using their calendar what's the rest of the pokemon company doing they probably forgot the password to their calendar app they don't know how to log in you know how to lock it unlock it left and only janine had the passcodes 6 pm pdt august 3rd players with an internet connection can download a free update which will include their words not mine beautiful new areas to visit and 20 additional pokemon to discover there are three stunning new areas one will it says secret side well what a beautiful name secret side path area one it will have a day and night version the neo one will shrink to a tiny size to explore this area and the pokemon you will see will look gigantic you can even hear breathing in footsteps in this thrilling area you might spot new kinds of pokemon you've never seen before so they showed this tiny mechanic you go you like shrink and then you go into like a tree and i i think people thought the tiny mechanic was just a mechanic for all the levels oh it's i think i'm maybe i'm wrong but specifically to this press release it seems like it's only for a secret side path um and then there's mighty wide river both day and night mighty mighty wide river is a new new nutri nutriting water nurturing waters we got there we got there greg i'm sorry you were struggling with that word but we got we worked we were working out you couldn't even figure out what word you were attempting water source that provides the whole wait oh yeah bells bilsoubala the islands have names i've never said any of them out loud you'll be conducting research as you ride down the river so be on the lookout uh for rapids when you search for pokemon keep your camera ready so you don't miss the action and then finally we have the baron badlands day and night in this area you will research the badlands of the volca island where dry winds from the desert will blow this area will has many particular features from geysers to poisonous gas spewing swamps pokemon behind maybe hiding underground or in the rocky cliffs so keep your eyes peeled across the three new areas players will find a variety of pokemon including those already familiar in players journeys across the lentil region as well as 20 pokemon that couldn't be found before um and then they talk about how snap is blah blah okay so we saw shroomish we saw snorlax we saw tepig we saw rock ruff um gyarados was always kind of weird weird that gyarados wasn't in the first one but he's here now i guess you could also say kind of weird snorlax wasn't the first one but here now psyduck psyduck so i already know half of the 20 [Laughter] which when i first i had to like take a step back because when i first heard 20 i was like well that's lame that's not a lot but the game only has what like 100 214 214 and when we heard that we were like well that's not a lot yeah it's not a lot still when you're taking four pictures of each and you're trying to figure out what they do and then you know when the japanese pokemon twitter is tweeting all these things that you're like how did you get that to happen i've put a hundred hours into this game i've never even gotten a crawler to walk this far like while 20 seems a lot it seems like a little bit in a press release the amount of interactions these pokemon have with each other and they're what they do and how to make them interact probably seems like a lot of work i i would guess i mean obviously these three new areas aren't just going to have 20 pokemon they're going to have the old ones and they probably have hopefully some sort of interaction i can't imagine they're just plopping cacnia down and being like okay there you go just gonna roll down a hill like i would assume that they're probably gonna do something it does look they do say new areas and i was confused i thought these were routes because they look like their routes of current areas but um i guess we'll see they i mean if they are genuinely new areas i would assume that not only do they have day at night which is great i would assume there's probably at least one alternative path on all of them yeah like one secret path yeah they're not very clear if they are all secret side paths but the fact that they say that the fir the nature park has a secret side path and the other two seem to stand on their own makes me think that they are their own unique areas but i have no clue well they say like new era it's three stunning new areas to explore like i think of the ice level where you break the ice wall with the sand slash and then that's like to me that's a new area to explore even though it's the ice path and then when you're in that ice path and you is it like the frost last that opens the second door there's like a secret path in that secret path so you like break the ice wall with sand slash and then somebody else breaks the other ice wall and then you're in like another new area with like avalog and stuff so these look like paths to me not specifically like maps either way i don't think it's i don't think it's bad no it's free so the best part when we were having the dlc conversation before i never thought in my head of like they're just gonna give us three maps that are free or three air again i don't know if they're maps areas right so to do like 20 pokemon in three areas for free how can you even complain but give me time but i i think that's uh it's nice i think that's oh it's very nice i mean i have yet to see uh rosalia included anywhere in there so complaint one you keep failing oh another chance for cramer there could be crams there could be cramps in that river crash there could be rams love the river right here yeah i love a river cram a little different than a jungle cram but river cram disney's jungle cram coming out cram does not belong in the jungle cram look river cram can go to the jungle and be jungle cram if we can have jungle crustal we can have jungle cram well you can you you have jungle crustal when you accept that you're going to lose i mean that's really what something i can agree with yes we don't we don't know we have not run all the iterations of jungle crustal we can't guarantee that that's true we haven't even tried jungle aldegas yet which is my next i'm a one out of one that jungle crustal loses the match i'm you know that's a hundred percent that is that a deep pool agreed is that a deep pool to be pulling from so will never got past meganium still there still there it's still there is is this exciting to you will are you coming back is this it is the push you needed i'm no it's not the push i needed but i i will come back i did enjoy playing pokemon snap it's just i had an interruption and it was like enough of an interruption that i was then moved on to other things but now yes it is an appeal to return greg obviously coming back maybe i'll play him sure i can't imagine this is more than like a weekend five hours on a friday night right yeah okay you said that the last time and it's like 65 hours later you're like five hours on a friday night that was supposed to be the entirety of pokemon snap this is a free update and it's one third of the amount of you gotta get pokemon snap this is how they get you and it's it's like they're lying there's some secret in there some secret swash i will die on this hill pokemon snap is one of the few games that is a million percent worth 60 dollars in my opinion like from a perspective from the whole blockbuster fiasco of like the first pokemon snap was not worth forty dollars you should just rent it you'll finish it in a weekend this was how we went at least how i went i'll speak for myself how i went into pokemon snapping like i don't think this game's worth 60 dollars it's gonna be too short i ate all my words there if people were still on the fence i sincerely believe new pokemon snap worth sixty dollars the fact they're doing free dlc adding 20 more pokemon three new areas 20 pokemon times four that's like 80 more pictures if you're a completionist i i i think it's awesome i think it's a really really good game it's it's it's value i mean and you don't even need to have captured a mouse to go buy it you can just go out and buy it what about selling a bunny or oh i can't oh poor bunny no i'm sad because bunny didn't make it it's the circle of life i know we tried august 3rd that comes out tuesday night right tuesday night which is a little weird do you think like a friday november games come on friday a lot of things are released on tuesdays well like the cds back in the day no they just there's a lot of research on tuesdays that aren't just cds back in the day i'll i'll be streaming my uh pokemon snap experience on tuesday night we'll see i'm very excited for these levels but i mean i'll watch maybe i don't know what else i've got going on on tuesday a lot of i hear a lot of things happen on tuesday they do new cds come out oh no that's right that's not true anymore tuesday tuesday is the best night to raid in final fantasy 14 because that's when everybody does all their stuff so you get the best players and you don't have to like it right because they're eager to play because the reset just happened because the reset just happened and there was like get it done so i usually am half of paying attention to somebody's twitch stream while i'm reading okay let's take a quick break when we come back we're gonna talk about unite we got a couple other news articles and we will be right back tricks lucky charms cocoa puffs tricks golden grahams cocoa puffs and tricks [Music] [Music] uh [Music] is pretty good [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh my gosh and we are back from our break this is off kotaku dubious pokemon reds one why is that pokemon isn't whatever clickbait pokemon red's one million dollar bicycle made real you could just said red blue or green or you know just pokemon well it's the character red is this what it is unless you picked blue then your default name was blue go move on [Laughter] to celebrate reaching million a million twitter followers the pokemon company i believe this is the japanese twitter the pokemon company has now requested the pokemon company has now recreated the sweet bicycle from the first generation games red and blue and their remakes in the in-game bicycle was priced at a cool 1 million poke dollars and it wasn't possible for players to earn enough cash to buy one because it cost uh because it cost a dollar more than the game could actually let you earn this uh two-wheeler could be purchased with a bike voucher fittingly the life-size reproduction won't be available for sale but it will be given away uh to anyone who follows at pokey underscore times which is an official japanese pokemon twitter account and you gotta use a hashtag in japanese and then 100 and the more japanese which i guess translates to pokemon million yen bicycle um while anyone could do this the rules state that the prize will only be shipped domestically in japan so i guess you could enter but so you find something buddy you get andrew to enter and then you'll pay andrew once andrew wins to ship it to you it even though it's a life-size bike it doesn't look like it works no you can't ride it oh no is that going right next to my bear walker skateboard yeah you can put it on the wall yeah like like it has pedals and it has wheels but i don't think there's a chain going there's no shade and also the stand is hardcore locked onto it so that the wheels couldn't possibly could turn but it's not gonna scoot across the road oh i see what you're saying i mean you could probably take the stand off maybe you're gonna break the bike finagle your own chain onto it i mean look at this frontier of the tire that is hard weld on to that bike uh bobby sent in the netflix article by the way brandon sent in the pokemon snap article kevin sent in the pokemon bike so thank you to those three in slack this bike looks the wheel looks cool i kind of wish they would be very cool give away the wheel like the pokeballs on the wheel and the pikachu inside the the frame um well because this pikachu bubble source squirtle and charmander on the inside frame and the outside tread is the pokeballs which is very cool it's it's it's very cool looking but yeah it's somebody will get it yeah and then we'll probably end up on japanese ebay i mean i mean i don't think those tires are too safe for for riding on that's what they should put out though pokemon center actual pokemon bike tires don't give them more ideas look dude i don't know what can we talk about pokemon center real quick i don't know what like they are just pumping out merchandise they put out this block party collection and it's like kind of cute but kind of cute actually i was very tempted because i was like wow this is actually kind of cute they have been i got burned with the moo moo milk plates though like i bought two sets and then i put one in the dishwasher because i was like i'm gonna use one because you know sometimes people buy stuff and then they don't use it so i'm going to buy one for usable stuff and i'm going to buy one for like collecting purposes and the no bueno that moomoo milk stuff came right off it was like poorly painted um it didn't say hand wash only to be fair it didn't say dishwasher safe it didn't say anything i don't know if these party block plates or maybe it did i don't know what what does it say here it says so no this says the same thing this is the same as the movement milk i'm looking at the back because usually it says on the back of the plate if it's dishwasher safe it just says pokemon center made in china fabric a n n-china b-21 i don't know what b-21 well maybe maybe b-21 means it's not dishwasher safe no the more details for the pokemon block art party plates uh on pokemon center it says dishwasher dishwasher safe can i go to the moomoo milk moo moo they have it they have it all right let me scroll down oh it does say hand wash only do not microwave okay oh not on the back of the plate though hoisted by your own picard okay i'm a little more in uh to be fair the movement milk was only 15 bucks and it's up on his i yeah so i very i'm very tempted by the block party plates because i think they're super cute i'm also weirdly tempted by the pokemon home accent rug it's way too tough it's way too small well it's an accent rug yeah but it's like you can't put a chair on it because it's an accent rug how how big is it it's 30 inches in diameter that's very tiny so i've got bathrooms bigger than that no it goes like at the foot of your chair like in front of your chair to look at that's the whole point it's a cute accent rug i mean it's cute i'm just very wishy-washy not the pokemon just very wishy-washy on the quality of some of this pokemon center stuff it's so hit and miss it well it is it is but they have a generous return policy yeah that's true like i'm looking at these lampshades are these good quality lampshades i don't know what is a quality lampshade that is the most bizarre combination of words i've heard all day yes does light go through it somewhat somewhat yeah lampshade can you see the light bulb if it's not intended to be a clear lampshade then you can see the light bulb that's a fail if it is intended to be a clear lampshade then seeing the light bulb is a-okay i mean it looks cute okay but will this pokemon celebration cap baseball gap the coal one how you need you you this is a hat for you i'm looking for it looking for it here is it in your clothing yeah it's under new releases is where i went uh um yeah except uh it's a snapback and snapbacks don't really fit my head particularly well like i'm looking at the pokemon block party metal table caddy centerpiece like there is somebody in like the seattle bellevue whatever office and they're looking through some magazine they got off an airplane being like what in this catalog can we order and stick pokemon things on i don't know why you believe this they have a whole crew of pokemon home designers who are just they at the metal table caddy yeah i don't see that in macy's every day it's valid you don't it's it's like it's cute it's for a picnic it would probably look better if it was white and not gray because everything else in the block party is white but this one's nice this is metal everything else is made of millennium what is that stuff called it starts with an m you're right it'll start with an m melamine does that mean it comes from honey yes oh spot clean only don't put that in the dishwasher what the metal table cabinet well not everybody puts everything in the dishwasher steve some of us don't even have a dishwasher so thanks for throwing that in my face anyways there you go get your block party stuff they're cute they're okay okay and stop saying block party it's block art party yeah block party sounds fun it it sounds fun except you have to hang out with your neighbors including that one guy who you saw what he posted on instagram that one time and you're like now my neighborhood is totally suss well that's why you get the table caddy is it snapback or velcro back is that different do velcro back that doesn't make a difference i i need sized i'm clicking too fast on this website they're going to ip band me they're going to think i'm buying pokemon cards or something the hat is machine wash there you go put that in the dishwasher i thanks for reminding me that i don't even have a washing machine the next you're going to bring up how it could be dried in a dryer that i also don't have it could be dried in a dryer i don't want to see what the instructions just hang dry will you know you go i certainly hang drive quite a bit oh you're not in a low setting do you not have an iron either why wha who irons this is 20 21. i like the iron you also like to wear suits to go to dinner with your wife you already got her married why do you have to impress her anymore i did i didn't wear a suit last night when i went out to i put on some slacks though because you went to b-dubs no i went to melting pot which i mean yeah and you you dress up a little bit for the melting pot you don't want to go in like a little bit because it's probably a little bit yes it's also let's kind of splatter some oil around and some other things so you know you don't want to be nice stuff well there is a home depot [Laughter] full of appliances yeah just wash your clothes there okay go over there and just roll across the parking lot bring my laundry i need to test out this appliance before i consider purchasing it sir this is hard though borrow one of their shopping carts push it back push it back and forth all right let's talk about pokemon united it's been out for almost two weeks yep they added guard of war gardevoir they they patched one of the champs they did not change any of the pokemon let's be clear they pissed one of the champs they did not but that's what the release note said i will explain because this is very click-baity because a bunch of articles said they nerfed charizard they did not touch charizard at all there was there's a held item called the muscle band yeah and muscle band can be put on any pokemon yeah and what it does is it increases your physical attack and it works perfectly on all 20 some pokemon except for charizard it boosted it too much so charizard was fine the held item was bad specifically pairing with charizard so they fixed that bug articles but it was a bug the item was doing something it wasn't supposed to so yes charizard did get stronger because of it but it was not intentional i don't think on this program i explained what the real problem with charizard is did i have i discussed this with you guys no no what is the real problem the real problem with charizard is if there is going to be a player if you're doing friendly or whatever and it's like just random people if there is going to be a player who is going to walk away from the game halfway through that's the charizard player yeah you're right you're right yeah always always always seeing charmander sitting there at the home base doing nothing makes me so mad uh i if there's anyone reporting to end the game early it's always a nine tails player oh they evolved too early that's the problem they lost right too quick they [Laughter] they used up all their momentum at the start of the match and now they didn't get what they want so now they're they're they want to concede i don't think nine tails players know zapdos are in the game i mean i played knight tails i know zapdos is in the game yeah you're not a nine tails mane i'm not i am i am the lonely left alone in the bottom lane el de gas where everybody's like yeah we'll go bottom lane with you and i'm doo doo doo and i'm setting everything up for you and then suddenly you're all in the jungle and i'm sitting there going hello anyone i guess i'm sitting on this goal keeping everybody at bay it's just like for some reason people look at cramer ant i don't know maybe i do a great job maybe people look at my performance in the top lane and they're like oh this cram has it handled and then they just leave me yeah i mean like i stuck with video video footage of probably 20 plus matches within the first minute people are like oh we're gone we out we're gonna see you later cramer ant we're gonna hang out in the jungle we're gonna have tea with dreadnough we're gonna go sit in the base and spam concede because like who knows what what i don't understand i don't get it i stayed with you i didn't you and i played games that was very our game was very goodwill yeah yeah i did not leave that match afterwards because you played poorly i thought you played very good i just had to pee so that's why i left the match oh okay i do i do want to clear up some clarification uh so number one if you subscribe to our patreon uh there is a patreon bonus podcast coming this friday that was recorded with um some people from our community and two of the people have like a thousand plus hours of league of legends so it was a really good conversation with them it wasn't supposed to lean that way but it was a community thing and they were very chatty and it was really great to talk with them so that is an hour episode that will be coming out friday in our premium feed if you subscribe for five dollars a month at ise dot cash or patreon.comcast you can also get the two bonus episodes of last month which had our pokemon go fest conversation um and then you'll get the other bonus episode with this month so i just wanna it's the start of the month if you want to jump on the patreon it's the best time to start uh the patreon and uh if you want to venture out and upgrade to the 25 a month we're running a special promotion for

all those details will be on patreon.comcast but if you want to sign up support the show there you go i didn't mean to put the ad right here but it made sense because i'm about to like repeat what's going to be on the show but i'll give you the cliff notes so what i've learned in the last almost two weeks of playing pokemon unite is people have never played a moba before yes correct 100 and that's fine um but it also made me realize the game doesn't explain how to play a moba it does not it does a good job of explaining i think like as a kid i remember watching football and i understood the premise of like you get the ball to the end and then you score points but i never understood like like the moving 10 yards to get your turns back or like why did they do this play or why did they choose to like run it instead of throw it or like why is there like you can watch football and not enjoy all those like technical detail details and just understand like you get the ball to one end and you're fine and obviously over the years i've learned how football is played i think the the more basic issue is that when when you watch football you eventually learn that there's a guy named the quarterback who has a job there's a guy who's a kicker who has a job there's a defense guy who has a and they're all doing different jobs because it's a team game that's true that's why this analogy i thought was pretty okay it's not a everybody run out into the field do what you feel like doing and let's hope if we all do what we feel like doing enough we win i'm going to the jungle no you're not allowed in the jungle uh okay so there the game explains like you dunk you shoot your hoops you score points more points win the game explains that if you do road tom he joins you the game explains you knock out dreadnaugh he shields you and that's kind of it from what at least what i remember i think there was a little zapdos in the tutorial too the tutorial covers like all the controls that you need to know but like yeah that's it oh yeah here's here's will will's quick tip of the moment guess what the tutorial doesn't say just kill opponents and don't ever score any points i'm seeing you folks i've seen teams where literally two people scored points and everybody else scored zero they have tons of kills that's i mean that's fine no it's not that's not how you win the game that's not how you win look look you can you can go through a game without scoring you can go through a game no no no no no yes me and captain snorlax greg el degos we should not be scoring points yes i don't want people to feel bad that they didn't score points because i think i have the opposite problem i think i have players in my game that are frustrated they're not scoring points so that's why they leave the lane because they're like they they feel like they're not doing anything so they're like i'm going to leave this lane to try to score points because i f because they they feel like they need to um so i i want to get these clarifications off like this isn't an expert guide if you wanna this is just you know the people who are just getting a unite the game doesn't explain this i'm gonna explain this really quickly um there's three lanes there's the top line the bottom lane then there's center which everyone's to call jungle the reason that's called jungle is because of league of legends and dota so by default i think jungle is more fun to say than center i think everyone's in agreement there center cram is way worse than jungle graham so there's no the game the game will recommend you to go to top or bottom or jungle but it doesn't tell you why and this is what this is my my hot tip of the week of why you would go a certain way so and an easy this is really easy to remember the reason you would go bottom is because your character is mostly defending the bottom is not necessarily to score goals although you can but you're defending down there and you're defending against the other team defending and the reason you the way you can remember is that is because dreadnought is down there and he gives you a shield to help with defense the other reason why you would go to bottom is because your character excels in the late game so an example i will use is garchomp gibble is god awful it's like gimbal ain't doing anything but once gibbel gets all the way to guard chop which will probably be like five minutes into the match garchomp can now do stuff there is more experience that you can earn in the bottom lane that is why cramer ant is never recommend cremerant can go bottom but it is not recommended to go bottom because cramer is good right out of the gate um there are some pokemon that are very good at the start and there are some pokemon that are very good in the late game and so that i think is never explained to people but it's it's just important to know that even though there are different all-arounders and there are different speedsters and there are different um here's a here's a really good example gastly haunter are complete garbage but gengar is incredibly good so if you're seeing like if you're if you're seeing a ghastly like helping you out it's like no you're garbage go back into the jungle like i don't want to see you until you wear a gengar because you're not good right now where zera aura is pretty good right out of the gate um but obviously like if there was a gengar for sarah oro gengar might have an advantage because it needs to level up it needs to suffer to get to that point so now top lane is mostly for scoring and the easy way to remember that is row time is up there to help you score so the top lane should be focused on scoring the bottom lane should be focused on defending and then the jungle the center which there should only be one and no it should not be crustal uh it should be flexing in between to help those two roles for example the jungle might come down help take out the dreadnaugh then the two people on top can then score slash push and that's pretty much why that's why like you know pikachu goes to the top pikachu is pretty good right out of the gate nine tails can go to the top because nine tails very good out of the gate nine tails could also go to the bottom like like you can put pikachu in the bottom you could put cram on the bottom i wouldn't put garchomp on top because there's not enough experience up there for garchomp but all of these roles are somewhat flexible but the game never explains like what is why why would you go to the top what should i do up there why would you go to the bottom um and so that's just like a quick like yep overview of what you're doing i mean also for the roles like if you are i i am an elder ghost player i don't kill pokemon i help you kill pokemon because it is more important that the attacker or whatever i'm paired with level up quickly and i have xp share that's building me stuff so you need to be of a higher level than i am anyways and then once i get close to four i'll kill something to push myself over but the supporter role in general is to set these things up for the person that needs to level quickly to kill and get the most experience and xp share does not give me experience for killing pokemon as an assist so i don't finish things off like if i'm running down people when you see me bring something down to a sliver and then i run past don't think i'm coming back to kill it i left it for you well that's that's not a gossip floor issue that's a issue with anyone running experience supporters well you don't have to be a supporter running experience chair there's like a bulbasaur build that runs experience share that is you know bulbasaur's an attacker but that build works really well the way you can tell somebody's running experience shares they have a little light bulb above their head yeah which is like it works like once you know what it does it's just very like in the you know 20 something years of experience share i don't think light bulb no but i i agree i like it like when you see it and you know what it means it's a visual yeah yeah but i i think even more fundamentally than that like like basic basic basics like elder goss snorlax uh i think wigglytuff too falls into the category right if you are one of these your main thing is is not to to collect points and score goals no wiggles i think an attack or your mystery is it okay okay mr mime sure but your point is actually to keep the points that you're carrying as low as possible stay in front of your good attackers good scorers soak up damage even die even sacrifice yourself because if you have zero points on you and you die you're only giving them three and that way the attackers either can score with their big numbers that they've collected while you've been distracting the enemy or in your sacrifice you weakened the enemy enough that they can pick them off and then make their score right it's your goal is not to collect the big numbers you're you're good because it's you you but i would i would i would put an asterisk with what will said and said you don't want to die if you don't have to no no of course of course which i think is another problem in this game where it's this isn't like a destiny or like a call of duty where like you die and you come back and you just do it again because dying not only drops your unite orbs but it gives your opponent experience and makes them stronger so in a situation where you're like i know i can't defend this goal anymore you're almost nine times out of ten better off retreating because they're going to kill you and score anyways versus at least just scoring and you're alive and you didn't feed them experience so another a word you might hear is like don't feed them um or you're feeding right now or hey this bulbasaur is feeding me which is like this player is dying over and over and they are just benefiting the other person so much if you're in a situation where like you died and then you're on your way back your partner dies and then you get there without your partner and it's 2v1 and then you die again you have just fed them free experience and have done nothing and i get it it's a 10 minute game and you might think like i don't want to waste 15 seconds of 10 minutes i totally understand but you waiting 10 seconds for your teammate and going in together so you're not feeding is way more valuable in the long run i was just going to say i think a lot of people don't know that if you can get far enough away from the bad guys uh the opposing team to a safe enough space if you hold down on the left hand direction pad that is called recall it's about four seconds and you get teleported back to your home base you instantly have your health fully refilled so if you can do that if you're very low health that's the best thing to do is to recall than to try to just stand out in a base or anything else that takes time to heal you up i think one of the one of the things that feeds people is the mvp system like there are rewards for becoming mvp and mvp only counts like i could have saved and assisted everybody but since my score is zero i am never going to be mvp and i think the mvp status and the rewards that you get from it drives behavior of i absolutely need to score as much as i can regardless of my role because i have to get that for this uh achievement for this daily mission and i don't i really do not like the aspect this aspect of the mvp aspect and the fact that they drive it to rewards because it does drive that behavior of even no matter what my role is i need to be mvp to get this accomplishment yeah i mean like i i think it can i don't think it does but it can encourage you to play other characters that's probably the intent because like it's usually the mvp is jungle like jungle is such an im like a good jungle will make or break your team um i will put this out uh mvp can happen anywhere so quick match it play all attackers and just just try your best and don't have it in your ranked i i've got an mvp on snorlax multiplayer i've got an mvp on elder goss but very rarely and only in the very beginning but like this is what um like apex did they started they did have like um they fixed it over time but they they changed they changed it to so pokemon unite and apex have the same exact battle pass which is in order to upgrade your battle pass you must do things required to you which is like win 14 matches become mvp three times apex they'll have it set up of like win become top three in a match with fuse or um have 20 people use your zip line as pathfinder or um get five knockdowns with wraith and they do it to like force you to play other characters which i think is really important in a battle royale when you're only picking three and if somebody picks wraith and you only play wraith and you're like i don't know who else to pick which is now becoming a problem in unite which is like if greg's only played elder goss and somebody picks elder goss greg is like well i'm i rage quit yeah i'm out so i take it off obviously this is their first battle pass and this is their first season but i think you know they should kind of get away from mvp i agree and they should do it like get one win with el lagos get one win with zara or uh just to encourage people to try different like you could be the worst zera aura but if your team won you've completed that achievement yeah like you really need to and i think apex does a great job at like forcing people to play characters they're they're they don't love i mean i i don't love like horizon in apex and it's like ugh i gotta do two games with horizon but it's literally do two games with horizon it's not win two games or get one it's just play two games horizon so i think and i hope that they they get to that point but yeah the mvp system is a little not great it's like it's like kind of the worst achievement yeah it's it's also frustrating like i as a support player so rarely get it and also because my numbers look low like people don't know how to read the things that i did and so they're like they won't good job they're just like well you did nothing and i'm like i kept you alive for 10 minutes yeah i mean i've been in games where you know they leave me in top lane alone and it's me versus two people and then it's like the score is over and it's it's like well i came in last and it's like well what were you doing up there and it's like i was fighting off two people like i did their chances like if anything i hopefully you guys did score a lot because i was i was holding off two people so you should have had an advantage elsewhere so i would hope you guys did what you needed to do um so i i think that it kind of makes me glad that like after a raid in pogo it doesn't say who did the most like they have the achievements now but it's not like then they're pretty random yeah and they're random but that that was a huge thing in world of warcraft where after a raid people would then target the people who didn't do well they would be like how did you only do this much or what were you doing the entire time and yeah i've seen that in league and dota where people like if they just because they didn't like the way somebody played like they didn't play well enough they get reported yeah and i'm exactly garbagey uh like one of the most frustrating aspects of what one of many one of them was people who would watch dps meters and be like you're only putting out this much you need to be putting out this much which one thing that i um i've always loved about final fantasy 14 is that that's banned and if the company finds out you're using a mod to check dps meters uh your account will be banned it's not just a conversation of you're a healer you should be doing dps as well and then it's like just settle down i mean if you're sitting with a full mana bar and none of us are hurt toss the dps in there i know you have a spell for it yeah yeah yeah just one help us do this faster i think the um i think there's like lots of talk about characters being unbalanced or characters being strong i think i i definitely see where people are coming from but like to to try to adjust characters after two weeks of data seems not good um one because like it's very easy to be like gengar is too strong when you've only been playing the game for like two hours i mean i i have no idea how gengar can suddenly appear and in two seconds i'm dead poison what happened i didn't even see anything happen and now i'm dead what happened but i can't say that that character is overpowered i just don't understand what happened like i i don't get it yet one thing that i've discussed with my moba playing friends um and and we kind of all haven't agreed to on the concept of this character is overpowered you know it's unbalanced the the key feature that i think of pokemon unite that is intended as a balancing aspect is technically every team has access to the same pokemon set to pick from and each team can have this if if zera aura is the best pokemon in the game both teams can have a zero aura there's not it's not like we pick it and you guys can't have it and that's the balancing mechanic yeah um there there's also like i heard somebody for the first time say like oh they really need to nerf snorlax and i was like what what as of this recording i played 160 games i would probably say 140 of those were ranked i can't say i'm having a good time with ranked i can't say i'm having a bad time with ranked i'm having a time with rank there's going back there's time with ranked i explained why i play ranked over casual though i like seeing myself become a better player but like the other problem with balance is that we don't know if the gengar or the snorlax you are fighting has paid to win we don't know if they have 30 30 30 on it and if they do i'm gonna go back to my clash royale argument just kind of shrug my shoulders they paid a hundred dollars to get this win off of you don't feel bad about it let them enjoy their game uh i mean eventually i i don't i'm not defending pedowin i think it's i still think it sucks that that is there i i wish they would have just added more clothes or more outfits i know that's hard and i'm sure that has to be i'm sure that's hard on a designer aspect and i'm sure that's hard in getting it approved by the pokemon company aspect of they have to approve these clothes uh hopefully as the game ages and there's more close they get away from the pay to win like league did league had paid to win they got away from it um but right now it exists so like it is completely possible where like i fought a zera aura i was there aurora that was a hard match up because there are auras discharge requires you just be standing right next to them which for xerora you don't want to be standing next to because they have discharge but i need to stand next to that zero because they have discharge and to me it was clear that they not that they were pay to win but they leveled up their held items and i did not and i lost that encounter every time um and that's fine but i i i i feel like people lose to a character and the first thing they go is like oh this is not balanced i and i want to address uh the listeners that i am particularly and disappointed in for the past week and if if i'm lying if i'm wrong show me my lie show me i'm wrong because we got a number of responses after our discussion of the pay to win where people were like oh i guess they didn't know that if you try to get a held item and you don't have enough of whatever first currency is i don't remember the name of it it like automatically asks you if you want to use tickets to get the held item then no not the held item it's the purple thing okay it's the boosters the okay so but you have to go to some other area to get specifically get those boosters so you have to go to the store to get the boosters and so i'll like like a character it'll say it'll say 10 000 coins slash um 600 gems or whatever for the booster it only says 10 tickets it doesn't say anything else so yes listeners did point this out if you spend all of your tickets and you have zero tickets then the booster will randomly say you can buy one booster for eight gems okay but it will never tell you that unless you are a completely out of tickets and which is like kind of weird because like like it is pay to win obviously it is the quickest way to pay to win but your it forces you to burn one of your currencies that you have to earn to then force you to pay which i don't know if they're doing that to like punish you into like wasting your tickets because you can use your tickets for other things um but yeah you have to you cannot pay to win that part of the game without burning all your tickets and then it's eight gems which i don't know what that equates to like i don't know if eight gems is a dollar or 50 cents or a quarter i'm not sure but it's eight gems per one booster first i think they're 10 tickets right yeah the 10 units yeah because you get 50 for 500. yeah well that's that's also if you're going in and buying those boosters and not just using the ones that you get as rewards for as you play through the game yeah because if you're just going in and you're boostering a held item yes right when you run out of those it doesn't say anything it doesn't even say go to the store and buy more boosters doesn't it it just says you don't have enough you don't have enough boosters so yeah it is it is weird that they they they like have that loophole or that hidden feature it you would think that like if they just wanted money they would just put gems on it and call it a day but if their goal is to make you waste your tickets before you spend your money i don't know if that's their way of throttling it but why do they care like if somebody wants to pay to win like it just it seems very weird um and i like at a certain point other people will catch up right like in a year maybe everyone will have 30 30 30 on their held items which is the max level is 30 right now well and there will be that one person is like i only want to play this one pokemon ever i will max out the items for the best build for that pokemon and i am done wash my hands right that's yeah the fastest and easiest way to do it for free yeah but even at after 160 battles i have not a single item at 30. and i've only upgraded four items i upgraded to float stone which i don't use anymore that float stones i think at 15. i did the buddy barrier um choice specs and then like wise glasses or something i don't remember the last one but it's it's it's hard to get a item to 30. like it's pretty easy to get into 10 and it's a little bit more difficult to get it to 20 but it's very hard to get an item to 30. so and you also didn't make the mistake that i did where i was like i'm gonna play talonflame talonflame's gonna be great and then you find out hey there's no build of talonflame that's great but snorlax you do pretty well with oh but i wasted all my upgrade tickets on items for talonflames yeah i got that and they don't translate to snorlax i i won the lottery though i got the talonflame hollow thing oh man and i'm like i will never play this character treat it to me i wish i could and that's why i've been making those graphics on like twitter and instagram to like help people feel confident about the held items they pick because if you are trying to be free to play i get it i i have not i i have put money into the game i have only bought a character i bought kramer ant and i've bought the 20 cramer ant raincoat that's it i have not put my money i think i bought one of the like the coin boosters or something for science i was like i don't know what was this 200 gems i don't know what it does okay boost coins don't ever buy that by the way you only get 2 000 coins a week if you're playing like 20 matches don't ever buy the coin booster i spent the 200 gems for science don't ever buy it but i guess the only reason you would buy coin booster is if you want 2 000 coins a week which is your limit and you can only play one day a week i guess that would make sense i guess but don't buy the coin booster ever um so the reason i was making those graphics is to be helpful because if you are free to play and you're like i really like snorlax and i really like i don't know elder goss if you only have so many upgrades you you don't want to put them in the wrong thing like will did you don't put your upgrades into things for talonflame and then realize those things on talonflame don't work on snorlax and another problem is like people don't know what they should put on um especially because the game is kind of confusing with special attack and physical attack um like even though kramer ant is a special attacker uh it's like aracudos are like special but it's actual moves like whirlpool surf or like or sorry the arakutas are physical the whirlpool the hurricane the surf those are special so obviously like the special is more important um like nine tails is kind of the one that is like split uh because like it's it's normal move that it attacks is physical but that move is really good because if you do it like three times they eventually like freeze and then it's it's it's like dazzling gleam especially so like nine tails is weird because it can benefit both from muscle band and wise glasses one being a physical increase one being special even though ideally nine tails is a special attacker so it it is very weird and i'm trying to i make those graphics to hopefully clear that up and i'm planning on making graphics like hey if you're going in the jungle and you're going to be a zero or an absol here's kind of like the pokemon order to do and what you want to do and um maybe these are the pokemon that are recommended for top and why they're recommended for top so i know i'm not the best unite player uh but i'm trying to help other people be better and i don't have to be a world-class player to look at stats of world class players and try to break that down to make it easy to consume for people unite is fun though i think i think it is it is incredibly fun i think that i think that it has legs um i don't think this is i the weird thing i was i was telling i think i was telling um another friend about this the weird thing about me streaming unite is like like obviously main series pokemon games are kind of like bread and butter because people get they're because they attract the most people um but when you when you take a detour and you play like pokemon snap or um was another pokemon game that recently came out that or like detective pikachu on the 3ds those games have an end point they have credits they're like done but like pokemon unites kind of weird because there is no end point there's going to be a season two there's probably going to be a season three there's going to be more characters there's probably going to be balances they're probably gonna i would assume change out zapdos for articuno in the future or mall trace in the future uh or maybe just they 10 really love zapdos i'm not 100 sure on that lugia and ho raids will come back ah yes but i i i don't think unite is going anywhere in like pokemon go i don't pokemon go didn't go anywhere it's here it's very dominant i mean at this point you either like pokemon go or you don't but my goal with at least with unite is to help people get into unite and to because i think once you understand it better and once your teammates understand it better you'll have more fun with it instead of four people trying their hardest and then one alolan nine tails sitting in the base spamming concede concede concede when it's only been like two minutes it's been two minutes it's been two minutes we haven't even gotten to zapdos yet and just go to zapdos like it's important to not let people get it as it is to get it let me make a call out to some some folks out there who who need to understand one thing i had one of our listeners our friend paul text me he said me and my boyfriend and greg and you we need to get together and play unite together and my response to him was that is never going to happen because i enjoy playing unite i will not schedule time to play unite what if i'm either playing it i'm playing it if i'm not playing it i'm not playing it it's not what what i was asking greg about before it's not appointment television not gonna schedule a time with you to play unite if i'm playing unite and i see you online sure i'll join a team or something like that and guess what folks that is okay if that's the way you enjoy playing unite you can dip in and dip out you are perfectly fine and you're able to play unite that way i'm also not going to put a lot of money or any money into unite and if that's the way you want to play unite you're not going to win a lot but it's still if you're having fun going out there and doing just running around that field as your favorite pokemon if your favorite pokemon's in there that's perfectly okay too if you're having fun that's what the game is for that's my uh what is it uh the more you know [Laughter] okay we'll do lightning round question of the week oh we are here hold on we're here i i got some questions we can we can burn through them and then to remind you to ask the question of the week all right we'll do youtube first this is from the cheese man how do you feel about the pokemon outfits in unite how do you feel about the battle pass would you buy the entire battle pass if you had an option i'll let you guys go first like are we saying to buy the entire battlefield get all 30 things done uh you well you can answer if you bought the battle pass or not and then i bought the battle pass and would you max it out with money no i wouldn't also i really wish the guard of our outfit was better i i'm not a fan of it i want it could be cute and it's just the way they designed it it's like a five dollar outfit yeah it's just not it's just a weird the bonnet fits really weird and the frilly thing is just it's the coloring is not right it's just i'm not into it so number one didn't buy the battle pass will not buy the battle pass number two i got the al black shirt black shorts black shoes i've got my outfit i'm done i don't need i'm not buying any clothes costumes they don't matter to me sorry um how do you would you buy the entire battle pass bought the battle pass i will never max it out i think in i've only the only time i've ever paid to increase a battle pass level was um in apex legends where it ended in like two hours and i was two levels away from maxing out the battle pass so i bought the two levels which ended up being like six bucks but that was literally because it was like 5 a.m and the battle pass ended at 6 a.m and i was so tired and i was like i'm not doing any more games with apex i'm just gonna spend the six dollars and i'm going to bed um as long as i'm actively playing a game and enjoying it i know i will complete the battle pass and if i'm not completing the battle pass to me it's because i'm not enjoying the game and so why would i give it money if i'm not enjoying it how do you feel about the outfits in unite love them i really can't wait to see more um how do you feel about the battle pass skins i think 95 percent of the current battle pass is hot garbage there's way too many socks uh there's so many socks this is from the person that complained because pokemon go didn't have any socks now we've got the inverse and you're also complaining the the first battle pass in unite has more socks than pokemon go could ever catch up with in five years at this point which is like we got way too many socks what is the like tube situation on not though enough leg tubes there are no leg tubes the the pikachu stuff and the cinderace skin i feel like alone make the battle pass worth it because yeah like pikachu outfit but everything up to that point is like real filler um [Music] so yeah i i hope it's the first battle pass so i'm giving a first battle pass i'm giving them a pass and i hope that the second one will be better but overall i think like the cosmetics in the game are really strong there are more there are more hits than yeah there are more hits than misses yeah i i want to see well i mean some characteristics don't have any yet so i would like to see everybody get some yeah uh this is from patrick uh from our slack community which pokemon would you add to unite and which type of character would you make them greg you're not allowed to pick rose the rosary line because you feel like you said that like two weeks ago i did so repeat the question which character which pokemon would you add and which pokemon would you add and what would they be a speedster attacker a defender i want i have two two things i want the mammoth swine line as defenders okay and i want sable eye as a speedster because he'd be running around jungkook i could see it i could see it foul play all right all right will this is a tough question there's a lot of pokemon out there to pick from i immediately was thinking mimikyu but mimikyu's just uh another gengar so and another pikachu for that matter i think uh the scoloped line would be really cool benipe and worlapeed skulloped i guess they would probably be an attacker because skulloped is pretty fast hits pretty hard we don't have enough water pokemon yeah or any water pokemon slowpoke i think that's it right yeah yeah those are like water pokemon i mean i'm talking can we get a waylord out here it just takes something like that picks up the entire jungle there's a whale right in the middle try to get past me i don't know boy you know what let's let's do um reuniklus if some freaky psychic stuff going on re-unique list probably support i would assume yeah no it's like it's going to be on the edge where you could build it one way or the other an all-arounder a jungle yeah there you go get your view nicholas in the jungle move over crystal we got a new jungle okay we're uniquely uh pokemon of the week all right so last week's pokemon there was a long long story about basically me getting food poisoning from i suspect probably it wasn't the sushi place we went to it was probably the fried chicken place i went to the night before um but i basically said that a pokemon tried to poison me because nick burgess was eating weird stuff that's the whole story okay all right so who is it is coughing i wrote down galerion slow king galerian slow king the whole story was about me getting sick oh i mean oh do you care about the the mask over its face yes yeah i remember the mask it has the black cape instead of the little crowd clown frill around it yeah yeah isn't it really like there's a lot on this page for sloppy valerian slow king design is so good but also so completely terrifying at the same time like i really like it but also when you just look at it you're like oh boy that thing's eating its head it's it's not in control anymore oh it's not like a parasect it's not that bad it's not that bad but it could be we don't know what's going on underneath there no pokemon has the same type combination as gallerian slobro and gallerian slow king in the tcg slow kings southern island card is the only card depicting pokemon introduced after gen 1 to have a square evolution box in japan only and the english version the southern island collection we used the neo-era designs which like all later card layouts featured a circular evolution box ju the johto slow king shares the category with pyroar they're both known as the royal pokemon the jotonian i don't really like the way they use that word dotonian i like it what would you like it to be that's from dodo like cantonian cantonian joe tony hilario joe tonight but like when you try to do hohen ho ho and you can't do that for hoenn and then for alola it's not alolan it's a lowland but there's no eye like there is because there's they're heated there is a way what is it for countries that end and end there is a is it it changes but i forget how it is countries that end in end on jeopardy tonight can't be one country that ends in ukraine ukrainian no ukraine ends with an e doesn't it oh it's but it's the word the way you say it right oh you don't say ukrainey oh that is good uh the drawtonian uh shuffle icon is solid there is no gallerian shuffle still not into this word why what do you want it to be joe tona knight pig joe tonight is okay i'm still waiting for the dragon night night because isn't the mega stones all end in night yes yeah well they ended it right charizard right monetary monetary they're so bad at names this company that's why they stopped making megas this is exactly why they stopped making them said these these are real bad are you ready for the next pokemon yeah maybe they just cut megas because they were like we really messed up with the names we can't keep doing this all right next week's pokemon according to a recent instagram post from a pokemon influencer this was the most requested pokemon for a featured master set the set is comprised of focus band and muscle band with which the average pokemon player will be familiar and also the new held item buddy barrier which will not be found in other pokemon games while many people like to argue that this pokemon is based on a cat it is more likely based on a hibernating bear the benefit of using buddy barrier is if you are at zapdos you can alt which has an aoe that damages all nearby opponents while the buddy barrier protects you and your lowest hp teammate in reference to previous pokemon of the week this week's pokemon can only learn toxic if transferred from a previous generation that's a little fact you didn't know right there all right really yeah they like got rid of toxic on like 90 of pokemon and geller yeah for the best does it keep it does it yeah yeah if you download it out of home it can have toxic huh is that allowed yeah maybe i don't know thank you for listening thank you for making it to the end uh we'll be back next week uh we'll have next week we'll be able to talk about the snap dlc so that'll be exciting and if you want to see the snap dlc i'll be streaming on twitch this tuesday when it

backseat me real hard and i was like please stop we're not here to like i'm not asking for any advice i'm sure you have dota players as well yeah i'm sure i'm sure they're probably very scared to admit they're dota players in front of other league players why those league players they're ruthless not our league players they're very nice i i will say that the the best experience i have had with unite is the fact that my very close friend trevor is a league player my very close friend chris is a dota player but the one game we can play all three of us together is unite bringing people
