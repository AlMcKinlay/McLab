bobby (1:06 - 1:09)
i had higher hopes for our listening (1:07 - 1:11)
community why (1:09 - 1:13)
i (1:11 - 1:13)
i am so frustrated yes that's (1:18 - 1:25)
about you nate it's it's about a lot of (1:22 - 1:26)
things (1:25 - 1:28)
i think unite is the focus this week (1:26 - 1:30)
because (1:28 - 1:34)
people yeah (1:30 - 1:34)
greg also here i am here and i have (1:35 - 1:39)
discovered (1:38 - 1:44)
a new candy that i cannot resist (1:39 - 1:48)
key lime pie kitkats are amazing (1:44 - 1:50)
and i love them is there a chocolate (1:48 - 1:52)
component to them (1:50 - 1:55)
i mean it's a kitkat it's a kit kat that (1:52 - 1:56)
doesn't mean chocolate (1:55 - 1:59)
i don't i don't taste any chocolate in (1:56 - 2:01)
it (1:59 - 2:01)
it's basically key lime flavor and the (2:01 - 2:08)
kitkat parts like the crust it's really (2:05 - 2:09)
good (2:08 - 2:11)
i made a mistake we found them at we (2:09 - 2:13)
found them at costco and so i bought the (2:11 - 2:15)
24 pack (2:13 - 2:17)
at costco so i have a giant box in my (2:15 - 2:20)
house and i am only allowed to eat (2:17 - 2:24)
one a day period that's like probably (2:20 - 2:25)
like two hundred and forty (2:24 - 2:27)
four hundred calories are you like (2:25 - 2:29)
breaking it off is it like one break i'm (2:27 - 2:31)
not a monster (2:29 - 2:33)
i'm eating the four fingers i'm eating (2:31 - 2:34)
the four figures of the (2:33 - 2:37)
cat and i break them individually and (2:34 - 2:38)
eat them (2:37 - 2:40)
unlike some people i know who just take (2:38 - 2:41)
a big bite across (2:40 - 2:44)
all four those are the true monsters no (2:41 - 2:48)
that is awful that it is outrageous (2:44 - 2:52)
unacceptable exactly (2:48 - 2:54)
yeah they're better than twix because (2:52 - 2:56)
twix is garbage twix (2:54 - 2:59)
is the only candy with the cookies yes (2:56 - 3:02)
kitkat has a cookie crunch cookie cat is (2:59 - 3:05)
not a cookie crust there (3:02 - 3:05)
cat is a wafer 100 correct but it (3:08 - 3:15)
crunches like a cookie (3:11 - 3:15)
that's like saying that the cookie (3:15 - 3:20)
crunch it's got the crunch like a cookie (3:17 - 3:23)
so the cookies no no a wafer does not (3:20 - 3:24)
crunch (3:23 - 3:28)
the same way as a cookie (3:24 - 3:30)
it's like drinking a bubbly and saying (3:28 - 3:32)
oh this is the same as drinking a soda (3:30 - 3:35)
no the experiences are vastly different (3:32 - 3:37)
i mean the flavors are different (3:35 - 3:39)
but i tell you the bubble that has (3:37 - 3:40)
caffeine tell me the difference between (3:39 - 3:42)
that and a cola (3:40 - 3:44)
apart from flavors should not exist (3:42 - 3:46)
category on jeopardy things that should (3:44 - 3:46)
not exist (3:46 - 3:50)
caffeinated bubbly caffeine (3:46 - 3:52)
is one of brent's favorite things wait (3:50 - 3:53)
is that a real thing (3:52 - 3:56)
yes isn't that just soda (3:53 - 3:59)
yes no it's soda without the sweetener (3:56 - 4:02)
until you follow will anderson's advice (3:59 - 4:04)
and put sweetener in it (4:02 - 4:08)
i mean diet diet soda (4:04 - 4:10)
has got some sweetener in it but you (4:08 - 4:11)
know (4:10 - 4:15)
you can put truvia in your (4:11 - 4:17)
bubbly you could put pure cane sugar in (4:15 - 4:19)
your bubbly if you want (4:17 - 4:21)
cnh piercing sugar from hawaii growing (4:19 - 4:22)
in the sun (4:21 - 4:26)
yeah i have issues with hawaiian sugar (4:22 - 4:30)
you have issues period yeah yes yes (4:26 - 4:32)
are we ready for our week's sponsor i (4:30 - 4:33)
don't know do we have the issues (4:32 - 4:36)

uh let's start with the ign article here (4:52 - 4:57)
titled pokemon (4:55 - 4:59)
live action series in development at (4:57 - 5:00)
netflix (4:59 - 5:03)
oh i saw that yeah written and produced (5:00 - 5:04)
by (5:03 - 5:07)
the co-showrunner of lucifer (5:04 - 5:10)
i'm not familiar big fan of that show (5:07 - 5:12)
how are you not familiar with lucifer (5:10 - 5:15)
because i don't watch tv uh it's because (5:12 - 5:15)
it got (5:15 - 5:19)
moved i think it was like on wb or yeah (5:15 - 5:20)
and it got moved to netflix and became a (5:19 - 5:22)
netflix series (5:20 - 5:24)
it did so since steve is not on my (5:22 - 5:26)
netflix account i'm certain he doesn't (5:24 - 5:27)
watch (5:26 - 5:30)
netflix and therefore hasn't seen it (5:27 - 5:32)
but i just don't watch tv that's the (5:30 - 5:34)
problem there's awesome (5:32 - 5:35)
do watch which which is really funny (5:34 - 5:38)
it's like i i also do not watch tv (5:35 - 5:41)
and the only programs that i have (5:38 - 5:42)
watched like in the last year (5:41 - 5:46)
are literally lucifer the good place (5:42 - 5:49)
i'm noticing a theme here except and (5:46 - 5:50)
also (5:49 - 5:53)
yugioh the original cartoon i mean (5:50 - 5:55)
how can you say that you don't watch tv (5:53 - 5:56)
when you when i have (5:55 - 5:58)
clearly been you and you have the (5:56 - 5:59)
property brothers and you say you (5:58 - 6:02)
watch a seinfeld or a simpson's episode (5:59 - 6:03)
true every night when you're going to (6:02 - 6:04)
bed (6:03 - 6:06)
how could you possibly stand there and (6:04 - 6:07)
spit these lies (6:06 - 6:10)
i don't think first off i put (6:07 - 6:11)
disenchantment on when i go to bed it's (6:10 - 6:12)
not (6:11 - 6:14)
it's never you've moved on from the (6:12 - 6:15)
simpsons (6:14 - 6:16)
what yeah i've moved on from the (6:15 - 6:18)
simpsons because i don't have a good way (6:16 - 6:20)
to put simpsons in my room anymore cause (6:18 - 6:21)
they put it on disney plus and i don't (6:20 - 6:24)
wanna pay for that (6:21 - 6:27)
wait why would the simpsons be i'm yeah (6:24 - 6:28)
it's on disney plus they own it it's on (6:27 - 6:30)
a z plus because fox (6:28 - 6:33)
disney owns i don't know (6:30 - 6:33)
okay i there was probably two episodes (6:34 - 6:37)
of disenchantment that was played last (6:36 - 6:38)
night before i went to bed i have no (6:37 - 6:40)
clue which episodes they were (6:38 - 6:41)
because i don't actually like look at (6:40 - 6:44)
the tv it's just like a nightlight (6:41 - 6:45)
because i'm scared of the dark (6:44 - 6:48)
that's what twitch is for no i don't (6:45 - 6:50)
that is what i don't want no no (6:48 - 6:52)
no because then you're you get engulfed (6:50 - 6:53)
in those conversations (6:52 - 6:55)
because it's live and it's not if you're (6:53 - 6:57)
not paying any attention and don't care (6:55 - 6:59)
what the person is saying (6:57 - 7:02)
aka me watching your stream i don't want (6:59 - 7:02)
any (7:02 - 7:05)
twitch garbage in my bedroom when i'm (7:02 - 7:06)
trying to sleep (7:05 - 7:09)
the last thing i want is for some like (7:06 - 7:11)
lo-fi (7:09 - 7:14)
streamer to raid some like heavy metal (7:11 - 7:15)
person and all of a sudden i'm having (7:14 - 7:16)
nightmares (7:15 - 7:18)
that ain't happening yeah you can't set (7:16 - 7:20)
a timer on twitch can you to turn itself (7:18 - 7:22)
off i guess you could set a timer on (7:20 - 7:24)
your tv (7:22 - 7:25)
is that do you listen to you listen to (7:24 - 7:27)
twitch when you go to bed (7:25 - 7:30)
who me yeah no i there's no tvs allowed (7:27 - 7:32)
in the bedroom period (7:30 - 7:33)
i mean i'm the same so what do you what (7:32 - 7:36)
do you do to to lull yourself to sleep (7:33 - 7:39)
i lie in the bed close my eyes and fall (7:36 - 7:40)
asleep (7:39 - 7:44)
wow i i in the past (7:40 - 7:46)
year have become uh addicted to calm (7:44 - 7:48)
sleep stories (7:46 - 7:49)
oh i've heard people use that i can't (7:48 - 7:52)
have somebody talking (7:49 - 7:54)
about the twitch problem i don't know (7:52 - 7:56)
what it is because i listen to those (7:54 - 7:57)
stories and i'm like i've got to hear (7:56 - 7:59)
the end i've got to find out what and (7:57 - 8:00)
i'd like i never (7:59 - 8:03)
never get to there are people talking in (8:00 - 8:05)
disenchantment (8:03 - 8:06)
yeah but i already know what they're (8:05 - 8:08)
going to say i can just ignore them i (8:06 - 8:11)
said you're not paying attention to them (8:08 - 8:11)
i've seen every episode like 50 times so (8:12 - 8:15)
it's not like (8:14 - 8:16)
even if i like picked up on a joke and i (8:15 - 8:18)
was like oh i know this joke is coming (8:16 - 8:18)
and like (8:18 - 8:20)
like chuckle and like my one eye open (8:18 - 8:22)
like barely asleep being like ah that (8:20 - 8:23)
joke's still funny (8:22 - 8:25)
like there's no anticipation because i (8:23 - 8:27)
know what's going to happen if i do look (8:25 - 8:28)
over (8:27 - 8:31)
like i i i know that's why simpsons (8:28 - 8:35)
was such a good sleeping mechanism (8:31 - 8:37)
because like i've seen them all (8:35 - 8:39)
i'm pretty sure there's like subreddits (8:37 - 8:41)
dedicated to like shows that help you (8:39 - 8:43)
sleep and we are future drama (8:41 - 8:44)
we are not going to the cesspool of (8:43 - 8:46)
advice that has read it yeah i think (8:44 - 8:48)
because also there's a violation of the (8:46 - 8:49)
number one rule (8:48 - 8:52)
of no tvs no screens in the bedroom (8:49 - 8:54)
no screens and tvs in the bedroom i've (8:52 - 8:56)
never had a problem with the tv in the (8:54 - 8:57)
bedroom like i'm (8:56 - 8:59)
just sleeping you'd be sleeping better (8:57 - 9:01)
without that tv right now you have no (8:59 - 9:03)
idea because you've never done it in (9:01 - 9:04)
situations like when you when i have to (9:03 - 9:06)
like stay at my like (9:04 - 9:08)
brother-in-law's house and it's like we (9:06 - 9:10)
got no tv in that room and now i'm just (9:08 - 9:11)
like (9:10 - 9:14)
listening to the wind when i could be (9:11 - 9:16)
listening to (9:14 - 9:21)
a different wind a wind called homer (9:16 - 9:23)
i have no problem like tv in the bedroom (9:21 - 9:25)
i'm always asleep within two episodes (9:23 - 9:27)
two 20-minute episodes you know i have (9:25 - 9:29)
action pokemon (9:27 - 9:32)
in the real world yeah (9:29 - 9:34)
i know tv in the bedroom i'm asleep (9:32 - 9:36)
within five minutes so (9:34 - 9:38)
no two episodes for me just i don't know (9:36 - 9:40)
because property brothers you're asleep (9:38 - 9:40)
in (9:40 - 9:42)
an episode as well yeah because i'm (9:40 - 9:44)
actively shutting my brain down from (9:42 - 9:46)
being forced to watch this terrible (9:44 - 9:46)
content (9:46 - 9:50)
i literally will knock myself out okay (9:46 - 9:51)
so back to the thing we were talking (9:50 - 9:52)
about (9:51 - 9:55)
according to variety henderson is slated (9:52 - 9:56)
to write (9:55 - 9:59)
and executive produce of the live (9:56 - 10:01)
adaptation uh he is currently the (9:59 - 10:03)
showrunner of netflix popular lucifer (10:01 - 10:05)
series based on a dc comic see this is (10:03 - 10:07)
why i've never seen lucifer i don't (10:05 - 10:08)
watch any dc thing (10:07 - 10:11)
batman well but it's not in the dc (10:08 - 10:12)
universe as far as i (10:11 - 10:15)
recall it's not i mean (10:12 - 10:17)
i mean in the comics it is but it's not (10:15 - 10:20)
in this tv (10:17 - 10:22)
reports say the series is aiming to (10:20 - 10:24)
replicate detective pikachu a 2019 live (10:22 - 10:26)
action pokemon movie starring ryan (10:24 - 10:29)
reynolds and justin smith (10:26 - 10:31)
however the netflix series will be its (10:29 - 10:34)
own independent production (10:31 - 10:36)
henderson also known for almost human (10:34 - 10:38)
has been serving as lucifer's co-show (10:36 - 10:41)
runner since 2016 when the series moved (10:38 - 10:44)
when it was picked up by netflix now (10:41 - 10:45)
it's one of the more popular revivals (10:44 - 10:49)
netflix has acquired from cable tv (10:45 - 10:51)
netflix is currently home to several (10:49 - 10:52)
existing pokemon anime series (10:51 - 10:55)
seasons and its interest to develop a (10:52 - 10:57)
live action series stems from the anime (10:55 - 10:59)
success on the streaming platform (10:57 - 11:02)
alongside acquiring more anime originals (10:59 - 11:04)
netflix is currently working to adapt (11:02 - 11:07)
several anime into live action shows (11:04 - 11:08)
including (11:07 - 11:11)
cowboy bebop and one piece (11:08 - 11:11)
the pokemon live action series no human (11:11 - 11:14)
will live (11:14 - 11:17)
long enough to be in a live action (11:14 - 11:19)
monday (11:17 - 11:21)
i mean they are setting themselves up (11:19 - 11:24)
for 17 years of paying these actors (11:21 - 11:27)
it's never gonna happen uh the live (11:24 - 11:28)
action series is very (11:27 - 11:30)
early in development so there are (11:28 - 11:32)
neither plot details nor casting places (11:30 - 11:35)
in plans currently (11:32 - 11:38)
so pikachu he's a detective plot done (11:35 - 11:41)
number one here's the question are they (11:38 - 11:44)
going to do murder (11:41 - 11:47)
no you don't know that do you there will (11:44 - 11:48)
be no murder (11:47 - 11:50)
you don't know there will be no murder (11:48 - 11:53)
there will be more crows (11:50 - 11:53)
i hate these early stages of tv slash (11:54 - 11:59)
movie development because like (11:57 - 12:02)
i can remember four or five years ago (11:59 - 12:03)
when we were talking about early (12:02 - 12:05)
detective pikachu before it was even (12:03 - 12:07)
detective pikachu i think (12:05 - 12:10)
and i feel like i guessed it on podcast (12:07 - 12:11)
or we had other people on and they were (12:10 - 12:14)
talking about how (12:11 - 12:14)
they want some pokemon journey but (12:14 - 12:19)
that's so hard to tell in (12:17 - 12:23)
90 minutes a poke like detective pikachu (12:19 - 12:25)
worked because it was (12:23 - 12:28)
not a trainer's journey from point a to (12:25 - 12:30)
point b because they cut so much for (12:28 - 12:31)
that was in the game that made the game (12:30 - 12:34)
such a good story (12:31 - 12:36)
yeah they cut that cruise ship um (12:34 - 12:37)
[Music] (12:36 - 12:40)
i guess you could do a trainer's journey (12:37 - 12:42)
specifically (12:40 - 12:46)
in a tv show like the anime (12:42 - 12:49)
yeah i mean but they're but they're (12:46 - 12:50)
already (12:49 - 12:50)
but that's the thing they're already (12:50 - 12:53)
doing that so they just do it but not (12:50 - 12:53)
live (12:53 - 12:55)
action yeah they're just they're making (12:53 - 12:57)
a live action version of (12:55 - 13:00)
the tv the current anime yeah that's it (12:57 - 13:04)
no they're not i'm the new ash (13:00 - 13:05)
okay this is why i hate this (13:04 - 13:07)
conversation it's like it's like it's (13:05 - 13:09)
going to be like picard where it's like (13:07 - 13:12)
ash is like all old and retired and then (13:09 - 13:13)
all the all the people from (13:12 - 13:16)
the history of the pokemon world come to (13:13 - 13:16)
visit and bring (13:16 - 13:19)
their problems it's that feature when (13:16 - 13:20)
professor oak has sadly (13:19 - 13:22)
passed on and yeah and gary oak has to (13:20 - 13:23)
take over (13:22 - 13:26)
yes and ash is now that annoying (13:23 - 13:28)
neighbor so it's like a cobra kai (13:26 - 13:31)
oh i'm so into this now yeah yes it (13:28 - 13:33)
focuses on gary oak and it's like (13:31 - 13:36)
literally the the show is going to be (13:33 - 13:37)
called smell you later (13:36 - 13:40)
yeah and i'm into it yes well do you (13:37 - 13:41)
remember at the start of this podcast (13:40 - 13:43)
when you were like i'm disappointed with (13:41 - 13:44)
our listeners (13:43 - 13:46)
i'm disappointed with you two right now (13:44 - 13:47)
why there's like 9 (13:46 - 13:49)
million things in the pokemon world and (13:47 - 13:51)
anytime tv show or movie is mentioned (13:49 - 13:53)
people go right to ash and it's really (13:51 - 13:54)
frustrating (13:53 - 13:57)
we went to gary we went to gary not (13:54 - 14:01)
ash it is a television (13:57 - 14:04)
program of the gens they're going to (14:01 - 14:04)
pick (14:04 - 14:06)
which gen do you think they're going to (14:04 - 14:08)
pick and get the biggest audience (14:06 - 14:11)
i don't know better look there's this (14:08 - 14:12)
whole (14:11 - 14:16)
subplot where the poetry (14:12 - 14:19)
of professor oak's poetry is going to be (14:16 - 14:20)
collected and published (14:19 - 14:22)
it's like and then like that's the (14:20 - 14:24)
culmination of the of the (14:22 - 14:28)
the the honoring of the old professor (14:24 - 14:29)
oak at the end of (14:28 - 14:31)
like the first season because there will (14:29 - 14:33)
be unresolved issues (14:31 - 14:35)
where like ash is actually the bad guy (14:33 - 14:36)
now (14:35 - 14:39)
yeah and then uh so gary is like holding (14:36 - 14:40)
the fort at the pokemon research and (14:39 - 14:42)
then ash comes in and it's like (14:40 - 14:44)
they have to come together but you know (14:42 - 14:46)
in the background it's professor oak's (14:44 - 14:48)
poetry that's going to save everyone (14:46 - 14:51)
i'm into it this is the best show ever (14:48 - 14:53)
why doesn't hollywood pay me (14:51 - 14:57)
or us fine i'll share yeah (14:53 - 15:00)
thank you i'm just gonna move on (14:57 - 15:03)
this is uh you're the worst you're so i (15:00 - 15:04)
see (15:03 - 15:06)
the listeners that i'm disappointed in (15:04 - 15:08)
all of them right now are saying (15:06 - 15:11)
i would watch that yeah i would 100 (15:08 - 15:14)
watch that captain jeterson down below (15:11 - 15:17)
chewing on his thumb (15:14 - 15:20)
about what because you don't you don't (15:17 - 15:22)
you don't like good tv that's the (15:20 - 15:24)
problem well he doesn't watch tv so he (15:22 - 15:25)
has no say (15:24 - 15:28)
why would anyone like for (15:25 - 15:30)
years of listening to ash's the worst (15:28 - 15:31)
character people's (15:30 - 15:35)
first headspace go to like oh i can't (15:31 - 15:36)
wait for the live action movie with ash (15:35 - 15:38)
like it's just (15:36 - 15:42)
so contradictory (15:38 - 15:42)
[Music] (15:49 - 15:53)
a new champion yeah but if you don't (15:50 - 15:57)
relate it to the story that people know (15:53 - 15:58)
that they literally prove that with (15:57 - 16:01)
detective people that you do not need to (15:58 - 16:03)
relate it to the story that they need (16:01 - 16:08)
pikachu in it had a pikachu (16:03 - 16:10)
yeah there's only one pikachu in the (16:08 - 16:11)
entire (16:10 - 16:16)
universe correct so obv it's that one (16:11 - 16:17)
for somebody who said you liked the (16:16 - 16:19)
detective pikachu story did you miss the (16:17 - 16:21)
point where detective pikachu said hi to (16:19 - 16:23)
ash's pikachu in that game (16:21 - 16:27)
look pet aunt (16:23 - 16:31)
i'm explaining to you how (16:27 - 16:34)
the viewers go and are (16:31 - 16:37)
appealed and appeased yeah and you're (16:34 - 16:39)
looking for a specificity and (16:37 - 16:42)
look your mom's i'm not the whole point (16:39 - 16:43)
of me reading the article was not to be (16:42 - 16:45)
specific because there has been no (16:43 - 16:47)
actors and probably not even a script (16:45 - 16:47)
written (16:47 - 16:51)
we are probably just (16:47 - 16:51)
same thing with the detective pikachu (16:52 - 16:56)
too like there was rumors of that coming (16:54 - 16:57)
out (16:56 - 16:58)
sure they p they probably paid the money (16:57 - 17:00)
to uh (16:58 - 17:02)
lock in the possibility of doing it but (17:00 - 17:04)
that doesn't mean (17:02 - 17:06)
that it was ever going to happen but (17:04 - 17:08)
they wanted to finally hear that they (17:06 - 17:09)
had the (17:08 - 17:12)
greg and i have been asked to spec out (17:09 - 17:15)
a full season of gary oak smell you (17:12 - 17:16)
later (17:15 - 17:19)
yeah you pokemon trading card game v (17:16 - 17:21)
battle decks featuring dragon type (17:19 - 17:23)
pokemon rayquaza v (17:21 - 17:27)
and neu vern v uh these were announced (17:23 - 17:30)
uh and they will make it fun and easy (17:27 - 17:32)
to learn how to play the best-selling (17:30 - 17:33)
pokemon trading card game and they will (17:32 - 17:36)
be available on october 8th (17:33 - 17:40)
um there are two battle decks (17:36 - 17:42)
one featuring rayquaza one featuring (17:40 - 17:43)
neuvern (17:42 - 17:45)
uh this release follows the introduction (17:43 - 17:47)
of dragon type pokemon in the sword and (17:45 - 17:48)
shield series because we haven't seen (17:47 - 17:51)
dragon type pokemon since sun and moon (17:48 - 17:55)
uh and it will follow the tcg set (17:51 - 17:57)
involving skies which comes out next (17:55 - 18:01)
month or i guess this month it's august (17:57 - 18:04)
uh each deck will have the standard 60 (18:01 - 18:06)
cards the reference cards the rule book (18:04 - 18:07)
a play mat (18:06 - 18:08)
damn it i think it's the paper play mat (18:07 - 18:10)
i don't think it's a fancy one damage (18:08 - 18:14)
counters metallic coin deck box and a (18:10 - 18:14)
quick (18:14 - 18:16)
guide to help trainers learn winning (18:14 - 18:19)
strategies (18:16 - 18:19)
for clarification purpose you're getting (18:20 - 18:23)
both decks (18:22 - 18:26)
in one package so you can (18:23 - 18:28)
easily battle with friends and family (18:26 - 18:30)
they say (18:28 - 18:32)
so this is one of those situations where (18:30 - 18:34)
somebody i went to high school with (18:32 - 18:36)
buys this for their kids throws away the (18:34 - 18:37)
instructions (18:36 - 18:39)
and then calls me and says how do i play (18:37 - 18:40)
pokemon (18:39 - 18:44)
yes yes also it says it comes with eight (18:40 - 18:46)
additional trainer cards including two (18:44 - 18:49)
foil cards i'm not sure i don't know if (18:46 - 18:50)
those are promos (18:49 - 18:56)
or sideboard (18:50 - 18:59)
not sure do we know what they like have (18:56 - 19:00)
the cards been released (18:59 - 19:05)
like do we have no (19:00 - 19:07)
the only thing on the the this website (19:05 - 19:10)
the pokemon.com is just a (19:07 - 19:12)
screenshot of the noivern and rayquaza (19:10 - 19:13)
which are the (19:12 - 19:15)
they're those two pokemon come out in (19:13 - 19:18)
evolving skies (19:15 - 19:18)
they're both flying type dragons (19:21 - 19:24)
interesting (19:23 - 19:26)
although i believe raymond quasar would (19:24 - 19:29)
be a bit more powerful yes (19:26 - 19:33)
vastly superior (19:29 - 19:33)
okay this was um (19:34 - 19:37)
you know i expected like a pokemon (19:37 - 19:40)
announcement before (19:39 - 19:43)
august especially maybe one that (19:40 - 19:44)
involved (19:43 - 19:48)
sinnoh because they focused on cinno for (19:44 - 19:51)
july and they've been really good at (19:48 - 19:54)
announcing things on thursday (19:51 - 19:55)
but they didn't announce anything (19:54 - 19:57)
regarding diamond and pearl yet (19:55 - 20:00)
here we are here we are uh but they (19:57 - 20:02)
announced pokemon snap stuff (20:00 - 20:03)
i guess that's kind of cool i mean they (20:02 - 20:05)
can only have so many announcements at (20:03 - 20:07)
one time right that's right (20:05 - 20:09)
otherwise we would be overwhelmed during (20:07 - 20:12)
this 25th anniversary (20:09 - 20:15)
how would we stay on top of it i (20:12 - 20:18)
what's happening there like (20:15 - 20:22)
nothing nothing is happening there i (20:18 - 20:25)
i can't imagine there's not like (20:22 - 20:27)
we're doing a countdown and at the end (20:25 - 20:29)
of the countdown diamond and pearl are (20:27 - 20:30)
coming out (20:29 - 20:32)
and we announce diamond and pearl and (20:30 - 20:33)
we've only showed (20:32 - 20:35)
one thing of diamond which was on (20:33 - 20:37)
pokemon day that makes sense (20:35 - 20:41)
and then they're like galler alola (20:37 - 20:44)
callos and you're like wow that's so (20:41 - 20:46)
many months of no diamond and pearl (20:44 - 20:47)
and then they get to july and they're (20:46 - 20:49)
like cinnamon and you're like (20:47 - 20:52)
we have to at least get like 60 seconds (20:49 - 20:53)
of footage like it doesn't have to be (20:52 - 20:54)
long (20:53 - 20:56)
it's just you know show us a little (20:54 - 20:58)
something show yeah (20:56 - 21:00)
they can't do it they can't do it (20:58 - 21:01)
because (21:00 - 21:05)
people were so at odds about the whole (21:01 - 21:08)
chibi style it's like now anytime they (21:05 - 21:09)
show any gameplay (21:08 - 21:12)
footage of the chibi's style it's like (21:09 - 21:12)
flares (21:12 - 21:16)
the five m those embers will spark again (21:12 - 21:18)
and i hate the chibi and blah blah this (21:16 - 21:20)
sucks why couldn't they have cut and pay (21:18 - 21:22)
some sword and shield and improve the (21:20 - 21:24)
trees and they had so many opportunities (21:22 - 21:25)
blah blah blah (21:24 - 21:26)
i was like i don't have time for that (21:25 - 21:29)
noise you know what you guys complain so (21:26 - 21:30)
hard now just wait until the finished (21:29 - 21:31)
product (21:30 - 21:33)
i honestly thought you would at least (21:31 - 21:35)
get a trailer (21:33 - 21:38)
so yeah yeah august is hohen and then (21:35 - 21:38)
yeah (21:38 - 21:42)
september is johto and then (21:38 - 21:45)
october is kanto (21:42 - 21:50)
and then diamond and pearl like (21:45 - 21:50)
this is such a weird (21:51 - 21:58)
release i don't (21:54 - 22:00)
so i remember in 2016 when they (21:58 - 22:01)
announced sun and moon right (22:00 - 22:04)
yeah 20th anniversary very good sun and (22:01 - 22:06)
moon's five years old (22:04 - 22:09)
and they okay they they did the trailer (22:06 - 22:10)
for pokemon (22:09 - 22:12)
day or whatever where they at least (22:10 - 22:14)
announced it (22:12 - 22:15)
i remember them showing krebrawler off (22:14 - 22:17)
for the first time (22:15 - 22:21)
uh at the world championship but (22:17 - 22:25)
they were like showing at least new (22:21 - 22:26)
pokemon (22:25 - 22:27)
once a month or something they're like (22:26 - 22:30)
oh here's a pika pack here's a (22:27 - 22:34)
komala here's a rock ruff (22:30 - 22:37)
they were doing stuff (22:34 - 22:40)
is coming like consistently i felt like (22:37 - 22:41)
every week they were like (22:40 - 22:45)
hey this video game is coming (22:41 - 22:47)
the only thing they've announced for (22:45 - 22:49)
diamond pearl is hey we have a date (22:47 - 22:52)
no new stuff we just have a date (22:49 - 22:56)
do we think it's because bandai namco (22:52 - 22:59)
uses a different google cal (22:56 - 23:01)
and they've the intern has never synced (22:59 - 23:02)
the two up so there's the (23:01 - 23:06)
main pokemon calendar that they plan (23:02 - 23:08)
everything on the same weekend for and (23:06 - 23:09)
they (23:08 - 23:12)
asked bandai namco to submit all their (23:09 - 23:13)
dates and they said no it's on our (23:12 - 23:14)
google cal (23:13 - 23:15)
and it's just never shown up and so (23:14 - 23:16)
they're like well i guess they're not (23:15 - 23:18)
doing anything but it's on a different (23:16 - 23:21)
calendar (23:18 - 23:21)
that's it yep it's you know what it is (23:21 - 23:26)
it's it's it's like more insidious than (23:24 - 23:28)
that because they're like they're (23:26 - 23:29)
posting stuff to the calendar (23:28 - 23:31)
but it's like kind of like how when you (23:29 - 23:34)
use the apple calendar and it has like (23:31 - 23:36)
work and home right and it's like they (23:34 - 23:37)
they're not paying attention and they're (23:36 - 23:38)
putting it on home (23:37 - 23:40)
home and it's it's like i don't want to (23:38 - 23:42)
work here but this is home stuff well i (23:40 - 23:43)
don't even have the home checked off (23:42 - 23:46)
to look at i'm only looking at work i'm (23:43 - 23:47)
busy (23:46 - 23:49)
buy google accounts for work only put it (23:47 - 23:52)
on the work google (23:49 - 23:54)
i don't think it would be that weird if (23:52 - 23:57)
there wasn't like (23:54 - 24:00)
like if there wasn't this countdown if (23:57 - 24:02)
they didn't do like (24:00 - 24:05)
alola kalos you know like (24:02 - 24:08)
because they did this countdown i don't (24:05 - 24:10)
maybe i just had bad expectations you (24:08 - 24:11)
had bad expectations you (24:10 - 24:14)
you fell for the pattern like if they (24:11 - 24:15)
had no countdown and they didn't (24:14 - 24:16)
announce anything (24:15 - 24:22)
it would be like not as weird i think (24:16 - 24:24)
if well if it was like it's weird to say (24:22 - 24:26)
like we are having a whole sin a month (24:24 - 24:29)
don't you love people and turtwig and (24:26 - 24:31)
that other monkey thing (24:29 - 24:33)
don't you love these chips and then like (24:31 - 24:34)
we're (24:33 - 24:37)
making a new version of the things you (24:34 - 24:38)
love (24:37 - 24:40)
but we're not talking about it it's just (24:38 - 24:41)
it's very weird (24:40 - 24:45)
it's not like it's not bad i mean it's (24:41 - 24:48)
bad it is bad there is no information (24:45 - 24:49)
that is by definition (24:48 - 24:52)
in the 25th anniversary a bad thing to (24:49 - 24:53)
be doing (24:52 - 24:56)
it is bad it is bad that we are here it (24:53 - 24:58)
is bad that this is supposed to be a big (24:56 - 25:01)
anniversary here and literally (24:58 - 25:04)
nothing has happened we've gotten three (25:01 - 25:07)
unrelated songs that are of questionable (25:04 - 25:08)
quality (25:07 - 25:12)
we had an animated concert like five (25:08 - 25:15)
years ago yeah it was (25:12 - 25:15)
four minutes long mm-hmm well twelve (25:16 - 25:20)
we've had (25:19 - 25:23)
we've got one pokemon snap game that (25:20 - 25:25)
finally has (25:23 - 25:26)
that was very very good though that's (25:25 - 25:28)
not that's but that was the only thing (25:26 - 25:29)
they've done (25:28 - 25:32)
we got unite also very good it's also (25:29 - 25:33)
very good but they're gonna be fair to (25:32 - 25:34)
unite (25:33 - 25:37)
nothing to be with unite we got two (25:34 - 25:39)
really good pokemon games this year true (25:37 - 25:41)
and (25:39 - 25:44)
everyone now hates pokemon go wait a (25:41 - 25:46)
minute i don't hate pokemon go (25:44 - 25:48)
well they roll back all their covet (25:46 - 25:49)
stuff yeah (25:48 - 25:52)
i mean yeah it's bad okay surprise still (25:49 - 25:53)
don't hate pokemon go (25:52 - 25:55)
i don't hate pokemon go either people (25:53 - 25:57)
are very mad we do (25:55 - 26:00)
we're not talking about pokemon go no uh (25:57 - 26:01)
i understand why people are meant though (26:00 - 26:04)
um okay so let's say like for whatever (26:01 - 26:05)
reason they're like well we can't (26:04 - 26:06)
announce the diamond pro stuff we gotta (26:05 - 26:08)
announce the pokemon snap stuff (26:06 - 26:11)
it comes out on august 3rd (26:08 - 26:13)
it could have came out on august 10th (26:11 - 26:14)
i'm not sure if there's a really (26:13 - 26:17)
like i i don't see the snap lining up (26:14 - 26:19)
with anything (26:17 - 26:23)
otherwise so it's cool (26:19 - 26:25)
we got a little bit of free snap stuff (26:23 - 26:26)
people will probably come back for like (26:25 - 26:28)
a friday night saturday night and then (26:26 - 26:30)
forget about snap again that's fine (26:28 - 26:31)
though like i (26:30 - 26:34)
might i turned on my switch to play (26:31 - 26:35)
unite and something (26:34 - 26:37)
updated and i thought it was the snap (26:35 - 26:40)
thing and i'm like already (26:37 - 26:42)
i still don't know what updated because (26:40 - 26:43)
i literally thought it was snap and i (26:42 - 26:44)
have no idea (26:43 - 26:46)
which game in the list was the one that (26:44 - 26:47)
i actually updated (26:46 - 26:48)

they probably forgot the password to (27:32 - 27:36)
their calendar app they don't know how (27:34 - 27:37)
to log in you know how to lock it unlock (27:36 - 27:38)
it (27:37 - 27:41)
left and only janine had the passcodes 6 (27:38 - 27:42)
pm (27:41 - 27:45)
pdt august 3rd players with an internet (27:42 - 27:47)
connection can download a free update (27:45 - 27:49)
which will include their words not mine (27:47 - 27:52)
beautiful new areas to visit and 20 (27:49 - 27:55)
additional pokemon to discover (27:52 - 27:57)
there are three stunning new areas one (27:55 - 27:58)
will it says (27:57 - 28:01)
secret side well what a beautiful name (27:58 - 28:03)
secret side path (28:01 - 28:05)
area one it will have a day and night (28:03 - 28:06)
version (28:05 - 28:08)
the neo one will shrink to a tiny size (28:06 - 28:09)
to explore this area (28:08 - 28:11)
and the pokemon you will see will look (28:09 - 28:14)
gigantic you can even hear breathing in (28:11 - 28:16)
footsteps in this thrilling area (28:14 - 28:18)
you might spot new kinds of pokemon (28:16 - 28:20)
you've never seen before (28:18 - 28:24)
so they showed this tiny mechanic you go (28:20 - 28:25)
you like shrink and then you go into (28:24 - 28:27)
like a tree and i (28:25 - 28:30)
i think people thought the tiny mechanic (28:27 - 28:32)
was just a mechanic for all the levels (28:30 - 28:36)
oh it's i think i'm (28:32 - 28:37)
maybe i'm wrong but specifically to this (28:36 - 28:39)
press release it seems like it's only (28:37 - 28:39)
for (28:39 - 28:42)
a secret side path um (28:39 - 28:45)
and then there's mighty wide river both (28:42 - 28:46)
day and night (28:45 - 28:49)
mighty mighty wide river is a new (28:46 - 28:53)
new nutri nutriting (28:49 - 28:56)
water nurturing waters we got there (28:53 - 28:58)
we got there greg i'm sorry you were (28:56 - 28:59)
struggling with that word but we got we (28:58 - 29:00)
worked we were working out you couldn't (28:59 - 29:02)
even figure out what word (29:00 - 29:06)
you were attempting water source that (29:02 - 29:08)
provides the whole (29:06 - 29:10)
wait oh yeah bells bilsoubala the (29:08 - 29:12)
islands have names i've never said any (29:10 - 29:14)
of them out loud (29:12 - 29:15)
you'll be conducting research as you (29:14 - 29:17)
ride down the river so be on the lookout (29:15 - 29:18)
uh for rapids when you search for (29:17 - 29:20)
pokemon keep your camera ready (29:18 - 29:22)
so you don't miss the action and then (29:20 - 29:23)
finally we have the baron (29:22 - 29:26)
badlands day and night in this area you (29:23 - 29:28)
will research the badlands of the (29:26 - 29:32)
volca island where dry winds (29:28 - 29:35)
from the desert will blow this area will (29:32 - 29:37)
has many particular features from (29:35 - 29:39)
geysers to poisonous gas (29:37 - 29:42)
spewing swamps pokemon behind maybe (29:39 - 29:43)
hiding underground (29:42 - 29:44)
or in the rocky cliffs so keep your eyes (29:43 - 29:46)
peeled across the three new (29:44 - 29:49)
areas players will find a variety of (29:46 - 29:50)
pokemon including (29:49 - 29:52)
those already familiar in players (29:50 - 29:54)
journeys across the lentil region as (29:52 - 29:56)
well as 20 pokemon that couldn't be (29:54 - 29:58)
found before (29:56 - 30:01)
um and then they talk about how snap is (29:58 - 30:05)
blah blah okay so (30:01 - 30:07)
we saw shroomish we saw snorlax we saw (30:05 - 30:09)
tepig we saw rock ruff (30:07 - 30:12)
um gyarados was always kind of (30:09 - 30:15)
weird weird that gyarados wasn't in the (30:12 - 30:16)
first one (30:15 - 30:18)
but he's here now i guess you could also (30:16 - 30:20)
say kind of weird snorlax wasn't the (30:18 - 30:21)
first one but here now psyduck (30:20 - 30:25)
psyduck so i already know half of the 20 (30:21 - 30:28)
[Laughter] (30:25 - 30:31)
which when i first i had to like take a (30:28 - 30:32)
step back (30:31 - 30:34)
because when i first heard 20 i was like (30:32 - 30:35)
well that's (30:34 - 30:38)
lame that's not a lot but the game only (30:35 - 30:40)
has (30:38 - 30:43)
what like 100 214 214 and when we heard (30:40 - 30:44)
that we were like (30:43 - 30:46)
well that's not a lot yeah it's not a (30:44 - 30:48)
lot still (30:46 - 30:50)
when you're taking four pictures of each (30:48 - 30:51)
and you're trying to figure out what (30:50 - 30:52)
they do (30:51 - 30:54)
and then you know when the japanese (30:52 - 30:55)
pokemon twitter is tweeting all these (30:54 - 30:56)
things that you're like (30:55 - 30:59)
how did you get that to happen i've put (30:56 - 31:00)
a hundred hours into this game (30:59 - 31:02)
i've never even gotten a crawler to walk (31:00 - 31:03)
this far (31:02 - 31:08)
like while 20 seems a lot (31:03 - 31:10)
it seems like a little bit in a press (31:08 - 31:11)
release the amount of (31:10 - 31:13)
interactions these pokemon have with (31:11 - 31:15)
each other and (31:13 - 31:16)
they're what they do and how to make (31:15 - 31:19)
them interact (31:16 - 31:21)
probably seems like a lot of work i i (31:19 - 31:22)
would guess (31:21 - 31:24)
i mean obviously these three new areas (31:22 - 31:25)
aren't just going to have 20 pokemon (31:24 - 31:27)
they're going to have the old ones and (31:25 - 31:28)
they probably have (31:27 - 31:30)
hopefully some sort of interaction i (31:28 - 31:33)
can't imagine they're just plopping (31:30 - 31:36)
cacnia down and being like okay there (31:33 - 31:36)
you go (31:36 - 31:38)
just gonna roll down a hill like i would (31:36 - 31:40)
assume that they're probably gonna do (31:38 - 31:40)
something (31:40 - 31:43)
it does look they do say new areas and i (31:40 - 31:44)
was confused i thought these were routes (31:43 - 31:46)
because (31:44 - 31:48)
they look like their routes of current (31:46 - 31:49)
areas (31:48 - 31:52)
but um i guess we'll see (31:49 - 31:55)
they i mean if they are genuinely new (31:52 - 31:56)
areas i would assume that (31:55 - 31:58)
not only do they have day at night which (31:56 - 32:01)
is great i would assume there's probably (31:58 - 32:03)
at least one alternative path on all of (32:01 - 32:05)
them yeah like one secret path (32:03 - 32:08)
yeah they're not very clear if they are (32:05 - 32:10)
all secret side paths but the fact that (32:08 - 32:11)
they (32:10 - 32:13)
say that the fir the nature park has a (32:11 - 32:16)
secret side path and the other two (32:13 - 32:18)
seem to stand on their own makes me (32:16 - 32:20)
think that (32:18 - 32:22)
they are their own unique areas but i (32:20 - 32:23)
have (32:22 - 32:26)
no clue well they say like new era it's (32:23 - 32:29)
three stunning new areas to explore like (32:26 - 32:29)
i think of (32:29 - 32:33)
the ice level where you break (32:29 - 32:35)
the ice wall with the sand slash and (32:33 - 32:36)
then that's like (32:35 - 32:39)
to me that's a new area to explore even (32:36 - 32:41)
though it's (32:39 - 32:43)
the ice path and then when you're in (32:41 - 32:46)
that ice path and you (32:43 - 32:48)
is it like the frost last that opens the (32:46 - 32:50)
second door there's like a secret path (32:48 - 32:51)
in that secret path (32:50 - 32:53)
so you like break the ice wall with sand (32:51 - 32:54)
slash and then (32:53 - 32:57)
somebody else breaks the other ice wall (32:54 - 32:58)
and then you're in like (32:57 - 33:01)
another new area with like avalog (32:58 - 33:04)
and stuff so (33:01 - 33:07)
these look like paths to me not (33:04 - 33:08)
specifically like (33:07 - 33:11)
maps either way i don't think it's i (33:08 - 33:12)
don't think it's bad (33:11 - 33:15)
no it's free so (33:12 - 33:17)
the best part when we were having the (33:15 - 33:18)
dlc conversation (33:17 - 33:22)
before i never thought in my head of (33:18 - 33:23)
like (33:22 - 33:25)
they're just gonna give us three maps (33:23 - 33:26)
that are free or three air (33:25 - 33:28)
again i don't know if they're maps areas (33:26 - 33:29)
right (33:28 - 33:32)
so to do like 20 pokemon in three areas (33:29 - 33:33)
for free (33:32 - 33:37)
how can you even complain but give me (33:33 - 33:38)
time (33:37 - 33:41)
but i i think that's uh it's nice i (33:38 - 33:42)
think that's oh it's very (33:41 - 33:44)
nice i mean i have yet to see uh rosalia (33:42 - 33:46)
included anywhere in there so complaint (33:44 - 33:47)
one you keep (33:46 - 33:50)
failing oh another chance for cramer (33:47 - 33:52)
there could be crams there could be (33:50 - 33:53)
cramps in that river crash there could (33:52 - 33:54)
be (33:53 - 33:56)
rams love the river right here yeah i (33:54 - 33:57)
love a river cram (33:56 - 33:59)
a little different than a jungle cram (33:57 - 34:01)
but river cram (33:59 - 34:03)
disney's jungle cram coming out cram (34:01 - 34:05)
does not belong in the jungle (34:03 - 34:08)
cram look river cram (34:05 - 34:10)
can go to the jungle and be jungle cram (34:08 - 34:12)
if we can have jungle crustal we can (34:10 - 34:14)
have jungle cram (34:12 - 34:17)
well you can you you have jungle crustal (34:14 - 34:18)
when you accept that you're going to (34:17 - 34:21)
lose i mean that's really what (34:18 - 34:23)
something i can agree with yes we don't (34:21 - 34:24)
we don't know (34:23 - 34:26)
we have not run all the iterations of (34:24 - 34:28)
jungle crustal we can't guarantee that (34:26 - 34:30)
that's true (34:28 - 34:32)
we haven't even tried jungle aldegas yet (34:30 - 34:34)
which is my next (34:32 - 34:36)
i'm a one out of one that jungle crustal (34:34 - 34:38)
loses the match i'm (34:36 - 34:39)
you know that's a hundred percent that (34:38 - 34:41)
is that a deep pool (34:39 - 34:43)
agreed is that a deep pool to be pulling (34:41 - 34:44)
from (34:43 - 34:48)
so will never got past meganium (34:44 - 34:50)
still there still there it's still there (34:48 - 34:52)
is is this exciting to you will are you (34:50 - 34:53)
coming back (34:52 - 34:56)
is this it is the push you needed i'm no (34:53 - 34:57)
it's not the push i needed but i (34:56 - 35:00)
i will come back i did enjoy playing (34:57 - 35:02)
pokemon snap it's just i had an (35:00 - 35:05)
interruption and it was like enough of (35:02 - 35:07)
an interruption that i was then (35:05 - 35:09)
moved on to other things but now yes it (35:07 - 35:12)
is an appeal to return (35:09 - 35:12)
greg obviously coming back maybe i'll (35:16 - 35:20)
play him sure (35:18 - 35:22)
i can't imagine this is more than like a (35:20 - 35:23)
weekend (35:22 - 35:26)
five hours on a friday night right yeah (35:23 - 35:28)
okay you said that the last time and (35:26 - 35:30)
it's like 65 hours (35:28 - 35:33)
later you're like five hours on a friday (35:30 - 35:34)
night (35:33 - 35:35)
that was supposed to be the entirety of (35:34 - 35:38)
pokemon snap (35:35 - 35:41)
this is a free update and it's one (35:38 - 35:43)
third of the amount of you gotta get (35:41 - 35:44)
pokemon snap (35:43 - 35:47)
this is how they get you and it's it's (35:44 - 35:48)
like they're lying there's some (35:47 - 35:50)
secret in there some secret swash i will (35:48 - 35:52)
die on this hill (35:50 - 35:56)
pokemon snap is one of the few games (35:52 - 35:57)
that is a million percent worth 60 (35:56 - 35:59)
dollars in my opinion (35:57 - 36:01)
like from a perspective from the whole (35:59 - 36:03)
blockbuster fiasco of like the first (36:01 - 36:05)
pokemon snap was not worth forty dollars (36:03 - 36:07)
you should just rent it you'll finish it (36:05 - 36:08)
in a weekend (36:07 - 36:10)
this was how we went at least how i went (36:08 - 36:12)
i'll speak for myself how i went into (36:10 - 36:13)
pokemon snapping like i don't think this (36:12 - 36:14)
game's worth 60 dollars it's gonna be (36:13 - 36:16)
too short (36:14 - 36:18)
i ate all my words there if people were (36:16 - 36:19)
still on the fence (36:18 - 36:22)
i sincerely believe new pokemon snap (36:19 - 36:23)
worth sixty dollars (36:22 - 36:25)
the fact they're doing free dlc adding (36:23 - 36:27)
20 more pokemon (36:25 - 36:30)
three new areas 20 pokemon times four (36:27 - 36:31)
that's like 80 more pictures if you're a (36:30 - 36:34)
completionist (36:31 - 36:36)
i i i think it's awesome i think it's a (36:34 - 36:38)
really really good game (36:36 - 36:41)
it's it's it's value i mean and (36:38 - 36:42)
you don't even need to have captured a (36:41 - 36:44)
mouse to go buy it you can just go out (36:42 - 36:45)
and buy it (36:44 - 36:49)
what about selling a bunny or oh i can't (36:45 - 36:52)
oh poor bunny (36:49 - 36:54)
no i'm sad because bunny didn't make it (36:52 - 36:56)
it's the circle of life (36:54 - 37:00)
i know we tried (36:56 - 37:02)
august 3rd that comes out tuesday night (37:00 - 37:03)
right tuesday night (37:02 - 37:06)
which is a little weird do you think (37:03 - 37:07)
like a friday (37:06 - 37:09)
november games come on friday a lot of (37:07 - 37:10)
things are released on tuesdays well (37:09 - 37:12)
like the cds back in the day (37:10 - 37:15)
no they just there's a lot of research (37:12 - 37:17)
on tuesdays that aren't just cds back in (37:15 - 37:18)
the day (37:17 - 37:21)
i'll i'll be streaming my uh (37:18 - 37:23)
pokemon snap experience on tuesday night (37:21 - 37:25)
we'll see (37:23 - 37:27)
i'm very excited for these levels but i (37:25 - 37:29)
mean i'll watch maybe i don't know (37:27 - 37:31)
what else i've got going on on tuesday a (37:29 - 37:33)
lot of i hear a lot of things happen on (37:31 - 37:33)
tuesday (37:33 - 37:36)
they do new cds come out oh no that's (37:33 - 37:38)
right that's not true anymore tuesday (37:36 - 37:40)
tuesday is the best night to raid in (37:38 - 37:41)
final fantasy 14 because that's when (37:40 - 37:43)
everybody does all their stuff (37:41 - 37:44)
so you get the best players and you (37:43 - 37:46)
don't have to like (37:44 - 37:48)
it right because they're eager to play (37:46 - 37:49)
because the reset just happened because (37:48 - 37:51)
the reset just happened and there was (37:49 - 37:52)
like get it done (37:51 - 37:54)
so i usually am half of paying attention (37:52 - 37:56)
to somebody's twitch stream while i'm (37:54 - 37:58)
reading (37:56 - 37:58)
okay let's take a quick break when we (37:58 - 38:01)

clickbait (39:28 - 39:32)
pokemon red's one million dollar bicycle (39:29 - 39:32)
made (39:32 - 39:34)
real you could just said red blue or (39:32 - 39:36)
green or you know just (39:34 - 39:40)
pokemon well it's the character red (39:36 - 39:43)
is this what it is unless you picked (39:40 - 39:46)
blue then your default name was blue (39:43 - 39:47)
go move on (39:46 - 39:49)
[Laughter] (39:47 - 39:52)
to celebrate reaching million a million (39:49 - 39:53)
twitter followers (39:52 - 39:56)
the pokemon company i believe this is (39:53 - 39:57)
the japanese twitter (39:56 - 40:00)
the pokemon company has now requested (39:57 - 40:02)
the pokemon company has now recreated (40:00 - 40:03)
the sweet bicycle from the first (40:02 - 40:04)
generation games (40:03 - 40:08)
red and blue and their remakes in (40:04 - 40:10)
the in-game bicycle was priced at a cool (40:08 - 40:11)
1 (40:10 - 40:13)
million poke dollars and it wasn't (40:11 - 40:15)
possible for players to earn enough cash (40:13 - 40:15)
to buy one (40:15 - 40:18)
because it cost uh because it cost a (40:15 - 40:19)
dollar more than the game could actually (40:18 - 40:21)
let you earn (40:19 - 40:23)
this uh two-wheeler could be purchased (40:21 - 40:27)
with a bike voucher (40:23 - 40:27)
fittingly the life-size reproduction (40:27 - 40:30)
won't be available for sale but it will (40:29 - 40:32)
be given away (40:30 - 40:34)
uh to anyone who follows at pokey (40:32 - 40:35)
underscore (40:34 - 40:39)
times which is an official (40:35 - 40:42)
japanese pokemon twitter account and you (40:39 - 40:44)
gotta use a hashtag (40:42 - 40:46)
in japanese and then 100 and the more (40:44 - 40:47)
japanese (40:46 - 40:49)
which i guess translates to pokemon (40:47 - 40:51)
million yen (40:49 - 40:54)
bicycle um while anyone could do this (40:51 - 40:56)
the rules state that the prize will only (40:54 - 40:59)
be shipped domestically in japan (40:56 - 41:03)
so i guess you could enter but so (40:59 - 41:05)
you find something buddy you get andrew (41:03 - 41:06)
to enter and then you'll pay (41:05 - 41:09)
andrew once andrew wins to ship it to (41:06 - 41:11)
you (41:09 - 41:11)
it even though it's a life-size bike (41:12 - 41:18)
it doesn't look like it works no you (41:15 - 41:19)
can't ride it (41:18 - 41:21)
oh no is that going right next to my (41:19 - 41:23)
bear walker skateboard (41:21 - 41:27)
yeah you can put it on the wall yeah (41:23 - 41:30)
like like it has pedals and it has (41:27 - 41:30)
wheels (41:30 - 41:32)
but i don't think there's a chain going (41:30 - 41:33)
there's no shade (41:32 - 41:37)
and also the stand is hardcore (41:33 - 41:39)
locked onto it so that the wheels (41:37 - 41:40)
couldn't possibly could turn (41:39 - 41:43)
but it's not gonna scoot across the road (41:40 - 41:44)
oh i see what you're saying (41:43 - 41:45)
i mean you could probably take the stand (41:44 - 41:47)
off maybe you're gonna break the bike (41:45 - 41:50)
finagle your own chain onto it i mean (41:47 - 41:52)
look at this frontier of the tire that (41:50 - 41:52)
is hard (41:52 - 41:56)
weld on to that bike (41:52 - 42:00)
uh bobby sent in the netflix article by (41:56 - 42:01)
the way (42:00 - 42:04)
brandon sent in the pokemon snap article (42:01 - 42:07)
kevin sent in the pokemon bike so thank (42:04 - 42:08)
you to (42:07 - 42:10)
those three in slack this bike looks the (42:08 - 42:12)
wheel looks cool i kind of wish they (42:10 - 42:13)
would be very cool (42:12 - 42:15)
give away the wheel like the pokeballs (42:13 - 42:17)
on the wheel and the pikachu inside the (42:15 - 42:20)
the frame um well because this pikachu (42:17 - 42:22)
bubble source squirtle and charmander on (42:20 - 42:25)
the inside frame and the outside tread (42:22 - 42:27)
is the pokeballs which is (42:25 - 42:30)
very cool (42:27 - 42:32)
it's it's it's very cool looking but (42:30 - 42:34)
yeah it's (42:32 - 42:36)
somebody will get it yeah and then we'll (42:34 - 42:38)
probably end up on japanese ebay (42:36 - 42:42)
i mean i mean (42:38 - 42:44)
i don't think those tires are too safe (42:42 - 42:47)
for for riding on (42:44 - 42:48)
that's what they should put out though (42:47 - 42:51)
pokemon center actual pokemon bike tires (42:48 - 42:54)
don't give them more ideas (42:51 - 42:57)
look dude i don't know what can we talk (42:54 - 42:59)
about pokemon center real quick i don't (42:57 - 43:00)
know what like (42:59 - 43:02)
they are just pumping out merchandise (43:00 - 43:04)
they put out this (43:02 - 43:06)
block party collection and it's like (43:04 - 43:07)
kind of cute but kind of (43:06 - 43:09)
cute actually i was very tempted because (43:07 - 43:11)
i was like wow (43:09 - 43:13)
this is actually kind of cute they have (43:11 - 43:14)
been (43:13 - 43:16)
i got burned with the moo moo milk (43:14 - 43:18)
plates though (43:16 - 43:20)
like i bought two sets and then i put (43:18 - 43:22)
one in the dishwasher (43:20 - 43:23)
because i was like i'm gonna use one (43:22 - 43:25)
because you know sometimes people buy (43:23 - 43:26)
stuff and then they don't use it (43:25 - 43:28)
so i'm going to buy one for usable stuff (43:26 - 43:29)
and i'm going to buy one for like (43:28 - 43:34)
collecting purposes and the (43:29 - 43:37)
no bueno that moomoo milk stuff came (43:34 - 43:37)
right off (43:37 - 43:42)
it was like poorly painted um (43:37 - 43:44)
it didn't say hand wash only to be fair (43:42 - 43:45)
it didn't say dishwasher safe it didn't (43:44 - 43:47)
say anything (43:45 - 43:49)
i don't know if these party block plates (43:47 - 43:51)
or maybe it did i don't know (43:49 - 43:56)
what what does it say here it says (43:51 - 43:57)
so no this says the same thing this is (43:56 - 43:58)
the same as the movement milk i'm (43:57 - 43:59)
looking at the back (43:58 - 44:00)
because usually it says on the back of (43:59 - 44:02)
the plate if it's dishwasher safe (44:00 - 44:04)
it just says pokemon center made in (44:02 - 44:06)
china fabric (44:04 - 44:09)
a n n-china b-21 i don't know what b-21 (44:06 - 44:11)
well maybe maybe b-21 means it's not (44:09 - 44:12)
dishwasher safe (44:11 - 44:15)
no the more details for the pokemon (44:12 - 44:16)
block art (44:15 - 44:18)
party plates uh on pokemon center it (44:16 - 44:19)
says dishwasher (44:18 - 44:21)
dishwasher safe can i go to the moomoo (44:19 - 44:23)
milk moo (44:21 - 44:26)
moo they have it they have it all right (44:23 - 44:29)
let me scroll down (44:26 - 44:31)
oh it does say hand wash only do not (44:29 - 44:33)
microwave okay (44:31 - 44:35)
oh not on the back of the plate though (44:33 - 44:38)
hoisted by your own picard (44:35 - 44:41)
okay i'm a little more in uh to be fair (44:38 - 44:42)
the movement milk was only 15 bucks (44:41 - 44:45)
and it's up on his (44:42 - 44:45)
i yeah so i very i'm very tempted by the (44:45 - 44:49)
block party plates because i think (44:48 - 44:50)
they're super cute (44:49 - 44:53)
i'm also weirdly tempted by the pokemon (44:50 - 44:54)
home (44:53 - 44:57)
accent rug it's way too tough (44:54 - 45:00)
it's way too small well it's an accent (44:57 - 45:01)
rug (45:00 - 45:03)
yeah but it's like you can't put a chair (45:01 - 45:04)
on it (45:03 - 45:07)
because it's an accent rug how how big (45:04 - 45:08)
is it (45:07 - 45:11)
it's 30 inches in diameter that's very (45:08 - 45:13)
tiny (45:11 - 45:15)
so i've got bathrooms bigger than that (45:13 - 45:16)
no (45:15 - 45:18)
it goes like at the foot of your chair (45:16 - 45:21)
like in front of your chair (45:18 - 45:25)
to look at that's the whole point (45:21 - 45:30)
it's a cute accent rug i mean it's cute (45:25 - 45:32)
i'm just very wishy-washy not the (45:30 - 45:33)
pokemon (45:32 - 45:35)
just very wishy-washy on the quality of (45:33 - 45:37)
some of this pokemon center stuff (45:35 - 45:39)
it's so hit and miss it well it is it is (45:37 - 45:42)
but they have a generous return policy (45:39 - 45:44)
yeah that's true like i'm looking at (45:42 - 45:45)
these lampshades (45:44 - 45:47)
are these good quality lampshades i (45:45 - 45:50)
don't know what is a quality lampshade (45:47 - 45:51)
that is the most bizarre (45:50 - 45:55)
combination of words i've heard all day (45:51 - 45:58)
yes does light go through it somewhat (45:55 - 46:01)
somewhat yeah lampshade (45:58 - 46:03)
can you see the light bulb if it's not (46:01 - 46:06)
intended to be a clear lampshade (46:03 - 46:08)
then you can see the light bulb that's a (46:06 - 46:10)
fail if it is intended to be a clear (46:08 - 46:11)
lampshade (46:10 - 46:14)
then seeing the light bulb is a-okay i (46:11 - 46:15)
mean it looks cute (46:14 - 46:18)
okay but will this (46:15 - 46:21)
pokemon celebration cap baseball gap the (46:18 - 46:23)
coal one (46:21 - 46:26)
how you need you you this is a hat for (46:23 - 46:27)
you (46:26 - 46:29)
i'm looking for it looking for it here (46:27 - 46:32)
is it in your clothing (46:29 - 46:34)
yeah it's under new releases is where i (46:32 - 46:36)
went uh (46:34 - 46:41)
um yeah except (46:36 - 46:41)
uh it's a snapback and snapbacks don't (46:41 - 46:47)
really fit my head (46:45 - 46:50)
particularly well like i'm looking at (46:47 - 46:52)
the pokemon block party (46:50 - 46:55)
metal table caddy centerpiece (46:52 - 46:59)
like there is somebody in like the (46:55 - 47:01)
seattle bellevue whatever (46:59 - 47:03)
office and they're looking through some (47:01 - 47:05)
magazine they got off an airplane (47:03 - 47:09)
being like what in this catalog (47:05 - 47:12)
can we order and stick pokemon (47:09 - 47:15)
things on i don't know why you believe (47:12 - 47:16)
this (47:15 - 47:19)
they have a whole crew (47:16 - 47:22)
of pokemon home designers (47:19 - 47:26)
who are just they at the metal table (47:22 - 47:26)
caddy (47:26 - 47:28)
yeah i don't see that in macy's every (47:26 - 47:30)
day (47:28 - 47:30)
it's valid you don't it's it's like (47:32 - 47:39)
it's cute it's for a picnic it would (47:36 - 47:41)
probably look better if it was white and (47:39 - 47:42)
not (47:41 - 47:44)
gray because everything else in the (47:42 - 47:45)
block party is white (47:44 - 47:49)
but this one's nice this is metal (47:45 - 47:53)
everything else is made of millennium (47:49 - 47:55)
what is that stuff called it starts with (47:53 - 47:58)
an m you're right it'll start with an m (47:55 - 48:01)
melamine does that mean it comes from (47:58 - 48:02)
honey (48:01 - 48:05)
yes oh spot clean only don't put that in (48:02 - 48:06)
the dishwasher (48:05 - 48:09)

i did i didn't wear a suit last night (49:34 - 49:38)
when i went out to i put on some slacks (49:36 - 49:40)
though because you went to b-dubs (49:38 - 49:44)
no i went to melting pot which i mean (49:40 - 49:44)
yeah and you you dress up a little bit (49:45 - 49:48)
for the melting pot you don't want to go (49:47 - 49:49)
in (49:48 - 49:50)
like a little bit because it's probably (49:49 - 49:52)
a little bit yes it's also (49:50 - 49:54)
let's kind of splatter some oil around (49:52 - 49:56)
and some other things so you know (49:54 - 49:58)
you don't want to be nice stuff well (49:56 - 50:00)
there is a home depot (49:58 - 50:03)
[Laughter] (50:00 - 50:05)
full of appliances yeah just wash your (50:03 - 50:06)
clothes there okay go (50:05 - 50:08)
over there and just roll across the (50:06 - 50:09)
parking lot (50:08 - 50:12)
bring my laundry i need to test out this (50:09 - 50:14)
appliance before i consider purchasing (50:12 - 50:16)
it sir this is hard (50:14 - 50:18)
though borrow one of their shopping (50:16 - 50:20)
carts push it back push it back and (50:18 - 50:21)
forth (50:20 - 50:22)
all right let's talk about pokemon (50:21 - 50:24)
united it's been out for almost two (50:22 - 50:25)
weeks (50:24 - 50:27)
yep they added guard of war (50:25 - 50:31)
gardevoir they they patched one of the (50:27 - 50:32)
champs (50:31 - 50:34)
they did not change any of the pokemon (50:32 - 50:36)
let's be clear (50:34 - 50:38)
they pissed one of the champs they did (50:36 - 50:40)
not but that's what the release note (50:38 - 50:42)
said (50:40 - 50:43)
i will explain because this is very (50:42 - 50:45)
click-baity because a bunch of articles (50:43 - 50:46)
said they (50:45 - 50:50)
nerfed charizard they did not (50:46 - 50:53)
touch charizard at all there was there's (50:50 - 50:55)
a held item called the muscle band (50:53 - 50:58)
yeah and muscle band can be put on any (50:55 - 50:59)
pokemon (50:58 - 51:01)
yeah and what it does is it increases (50:59 - 51:04)
your physical attack (51:01 - 51:07)
and it works perfectly on all (51:04 - 51:10)
20 some pokemon except for charizard it (51:07 - 51:12)
boosted it too much (51:10 - 51:16)
so charizard was fine the held item was (51:12 - 51:17)
bad (51:16 - 51:19)
specifically pairing with charizard so (51:17 - 51:22)
they fixed that bug (51:19 - 51:24)
articles (51:22 - 51:24)
but it was a bug the item was doing (51:27 - 51:32)
something it wasn't supposed to so yes (51:30 - 51:34)
charizard did get stronger because of it (51:32 - 51:35)
but it was not intentional (51:34 - 51:38)
i don't think on this program i (51:35 - 51:40)
explained what the real problem with (51:38 - 51:41)
charizard is (51:40 - 51:43)
did i have i discussed this with you (51:41 - 51:45)
guys no no what is the real problem (51:43 - 51:49)
the real problem with charizard is (51:45 - 51:51)
if there is going to be a player if (51:49 - 51:52)
you're doing (51:51 - 51:55)
friendly or whatever and it's like just (51:52 - 51:56)
random people (51:55 - 51:58)
if there is going to be a player who is (51:56 - 52:00)
going to walk away from the game halfway (51:58 - 52:01)
through (52:00 - 52:03)
that's the charizard player yeah you're (52:01 - 52:05)
right you're right yeah always (52:03 - 52:07)
always always seeing charmander sitting (52:05 - 52:09)
there at the home base (52:07 - 52:12)
doing nothing makes me so mad uh i (52:09 - 52:13)
if there's anyone reporting to end the (52:12 - 52:16)
game early it's always a nine tails (52:13 - 52:17)
player (52:16 - 52:20)
oh they evolved too early that's the (52:17 - 52:20)
problem (52:20 - 52:22)
they lost right too quick they (52:20 - 52:25)
[Laughter] (52:22 - 52:27)
they used up all their momentum at the (52:25 - 52:28)
start of the match and now they didn't (52:27 - 52:30)
get what they want so now they're (52:28 - 52:32)
they're they want to concede i don't (52:30 - 52:33)
think nine tails players know zapdos are (52:32 - 52:36)
in the game (52:33 - 52:37)
i mean i played knight tails i know (52:36 - 52:39)
zapdos is in the game (52:37 - 52:41)
yeah you're not a nine tails mane i'm (52:39 - 52:42)
not i am (52:41 - 52:45)
i am the lonely left alone in the bottom (52:42 - 52:47)
lane el de gas (52:45 - 52:48)
where everybody's like yeah we'll go (52:47 - 52:50)
bottom lane with you and i'm doo doo doo (52:48 - 52:51)
and i'm setting everything up for you (52:50 - 52:54)
and then suddenly you're all in the (52:51 - 52:54)
jungle (52:54 - 52:58)
and i'm sitting there going (52:54 - 53:01)
hello anyone i guess i'm sitting on this (52:58 - 53:03)
goal keeping everybody at bay (53:01 - 53:06)
it's just like for some reason people (53:03 - 53:07)
look at cramer ant (53:06 - 53:09)
i don't know maybe i do a great job (53:07 - 53:10)
maybe people look at my performance in (53:09 - 53:12)
the top lane and they're like (53:10 - 53:14)
oh this cram has it handled and then (53:12 - 53:16)
they just leave me yeah (53:14 - 53:19)

show there you go i didn't mean to put (55:33 - 55:37)
the ad right here but it made sense (55:35 - 55:39)
because i'm about to like repeat what's (55:37 - 55:40)
going to be on the show but i'll give (55:39 - 55:41)
you the cliff notes (55:40 - 55:44)
so what i've learned in the last almost (55:41 - 55:46)
two weeks of playing pokemon unite (55:44 - 55:49)
is people have never played a moba (55:46 - 55:50)
before (55:49 - 55:54)
yes correct 100 and that's fine (55:50 - 55:57)
um but it also made me realize the game (55:54 - 56:00)
doesn't explain how to play a moba (55:57 - 56:03)
it does not it does a good job of (56:00 - 56:06)
explaining (56:03 - 56:06)
i think like as a kid i remember (56:07 - 56:11)
watching football (56:10 - 56:13)
and i understood the premise of like you (56:11 - 56:14)
get the ball to the (56:13 - 56:18)
end and then you score points (56:14 - 56:21)
but i never understood like (56:18 - 56:21)
like the moving 10 yards to get your (56:22 - 56:26)
turns back or like why did they do this (56:24 - 56:28)
play or why did they (56:26 - 56:30)
choose to like run it instead of throw (56:28 - 56:32)
it or like why is there like (56:30 - 56:34)
you can watch football and not enjoy all (56:32 - 56:36)
those like technical detail (56:34 - 56:38)
details and just understand like you get (56:36 - 56:40)
the ball to one end and you're fine and (56:38 - 56:42)
obviously over the years i've learned (56:40 - 56:45)
how football is played (56:42 - 56:48)
i think the the more basic issue (56:45 - 56:51)
is that when when you watch football (56:48 - 56:54)
you eventually learn that there's a guy (56:51 - 56:56)
named the quarterback who has (56:54 - 56:59)
a job there's a guy who's a kicker who (56:56 - 57:00)
has (56:59 - 57:03)
a job there's a defense guy who has a (57:00 - 57:05)
and they're all doing different jobs (57:03 - 57:07)
because it's a (57:05 - 57:10)
team game that's true that's why this (57:07 - 57:12)
analogy i thought was pretty okay (57:10 - 57:16)
it's not a everybody run out into the (57:12 - 57:17)
field do what you feel like doing and (57:16 - 57:19)
let's hope if we all do what we feel (57:17 - 57:20)
like doing (57:19 - 57:25)
enough we win i'm going to the jungle (57:20 - 57:28)
no you're not allowed in the jungle (57:25 - 57:32)
uh okay so there (57:28 - 57:35)
the game explains like you dunk (57:32 - 57:37)
you shoot your hoops you score points (57:35 - 57:39)
more points win the game explains that (57:37 - 57:41)
if you do road tom he joins you (57:39 - 57:42)
the game explains you knock out (57:41 - 57:44)
dreadnaugh he (57:42 - 57:46)
shields you and that's kind of it from (57:44 - 57:49)
what at least what i remember (57:46 - 57:49)
i think there was a little zapdos in the (57:49 - 57:53)
tutorial too the tutorial covers like (57:51 - 57:55)
all the controls that you need to know (57:53 - 57:56)
but like yeah (57:55 - 57:59)
that's it oh yeah here's here's will (57:56 - 58:01)
will's quick tip of the moment (57:59 - 58:04)
guess what the tutorial doesn't say (58:01 - 58:06)
just kill opponents and don't ever score (58:04 - 58:08)
any points (58:06 - 58:11)
i'm seeing you folks (58:08 - 58:14)
i've seen teams where literally two (58:11 - 58:15)
people scored points (58:14 - 58:17)
and everybody else scored zero they have (58:15 - 58:18)
tons of kills (58:17 - 58:21)
that's i mean that's fine no it's not (58:18 - 58:23)
that's not how you win the game (58:21 - 58:27)
that's not how you win look look you can (58:23 - 58:28)
you can go through a game without (58:27 - 58:30)
scoring you can go through a game (58:28 - 58:33)
no no no no no yes me and captain (58:30 - 58:34)
snorlax (58:33 - 58:37)
greg el degos we should not be scoring (58:34 - 58:38)
points (58:37 - 58:40)
yes i don't want people to feel bad that (58:38 - 58:42)
they didn't score points because i think (58:40 - 58:43)
i have the opposite problem i think i (58:42 - 58:44)
have (58:43 - 58:46)
players in my game that are frustrated (58:44 - 58:47)
they're not scoring points so that's why (58:46 - 58:48)
they (58:47 - 58:52)
leave the lane because they're like they (58:48 - 58:53)
they feel like they're not doing (58:52 - 58:55)
anything so they're like i'm going to (58:53 - 58:57)
leave this lane to try to score points (58:55 - 58:58)
because i f (58:57 - 59:01)
because they they feel like they need to (58:58 - 59:02)
um so i i want to get these (59:01 - 59:03)
clarifications off (59:02 - 59:05)
like this isn't an expert guide if you (59:03 - 59:07)
wanna this is just you know the people (59:05 - 59:09)
who are just getting a unite (59:07 - 59:11)
the game doesn't explain this i'm gonna (59:09 - 59:13)
explain this really quickly (59:11 - 59:15)
um there's three lanes there's the top (59:13 - 59:16)
line the bottom lane then there's center (59:15 - 59:18)
which everyone's to call jungle the (59:16 - 59:19)
reason that's called jungle is because (59:18 - 59:20)
of league of legends (59:19 - 59:23)
and dota so by default i think jungle is (59:20 - 59:26)
more fun to say than center (59:23 - 59:28)
i think everyone's in agreement there (59:26 - 59:30)
center cram is way worse (59:28 - 59:33)
than jungle graham (59:30 - 59:37)
so there's no the game the game will (59:33 - 59:39)
recommend you to go to top or bottom or (59:37 - 59:40)
jungle but it doesn't tell you (59:39 - 59:43)
why and this is what this is my my hot (59:40 - 59:45)
tip of the week (59:43 - 59:47)
of why you would go a certain way so and (59:45 - 59:49)
an easy this is really easy to remember (59:47 - 59:51)
the reason you would go bottom is (59:49 - 59:53)
because your character is (59:51 - 59:56)
mostly defending the bottom is not (59:53 - 59:58)
necessarily to score goals (59:56 - 60:01)
although you can but you're defending (59:58 - 60:02)
down there and you're defending against (60:01 - 60:04)
the other team defending (60:02 - 60:06)
and the reason you the way you can (60:04 - 60:08)
remember is that is because dreadnought (60:06 - 60:10)
is down there and he gives you a shield (60:08 - 60:14)
to help with defense the other reason (60:10 - 60:14)
why (60:14 - 60:16)
you would go to bottom is because your (60:14 - 60:17)
character (60:16 - 60:21)
excels in the late game (60:17 - 60:23)
so an example i will use is garchomp (60:21 - 60:25)
gibble is (60:23 - 60:28)
god awful it's like gimbal ain't doing (60:25 - 60:30)
anything but once gibbel gets all the (60:28 - 60:32)
way to guard chop which will probably be (60:30 - 60:33)
like (60:32 - 60:35)
five minutes into the match garchomp can (60:33 - 60:36)
now do stuff (60:35 - 60:39)
there is more experience that you can (60:36 - 60:39)
earn (60:39 - 60:43)
in the bottom lane that is why cramer (60:39 - 60:43)
ant (60:43 - 60:46)
is never recommend cremerant can go (60:43 - 60:48)
bottom but it is not recommended to go (60:46 - 60:49)
bottom because cramer (60:48 - 60:52)
is good right out of the gate um (60:49 - 60:53)
there are some pokemon that are very (60:52 - 60:55)
good at the start (60:53 - 60:57)
and there are some pokemon that are very (60:55 - 60:59)
good in the late game (60:57 - 61:02)
and so that i think is never explained (60:59 - 61:03)
to people (61:02 - 61:07)
but it's it's just important to know (61:03 - 61:09)
that even though there are different (61:07 - 61:11)
all-arounders and there are different (61:09 - 61:13)
speedsters and there are different (61:11 - 61:17)
um here's a here's a really good example (61:13 - 61:17)
gastly haunter are complete garbage but (61:18 - 61:22)
gengar is (61:21 - 61:25)
incredibly good so if you're seeing like (61:22 - 61:26)
if you're (61:25 - 61:28)
if you're seeing a ghastly like helping (61:26 - 61:29)
you out (61:28 - 61:32)
it's like no you're garbage go back into (61:29 - 61:33)
the jungle (61:32 - 61:35)
like i don't want to see you until you (61:33 - 61:36)
wear a gengar (61:35 - 61:39)
because you're not good right now where (61:36 - 61:40)
zera aura is pretty good right out of (61:39 - 61:41)
the gate (61:40 - 61:46)
um but obviously like if there was a (61:41 - 61:48)
gengar for sarah oro gengar might have (61:46 - 61:49)
an advantage because (61:48 - 61:51)
it needs to level up it needs to suffer (61:49 - 61:52)
to get to that point (61:51 - 61:56)
so now top lane is mostly for scoring (61:52 - 61:57)
and the easy way to remember that is row (61:56 - 62:00)
time is up there to help you score (61:57 - 62:02)
so the top lane should be focused on (62:00 - 62:03)
scoring (62:02 - 62:04)
the bottom lane should be focused on (62:03 - 62:06)
defending and then the jungle (62:04 - 62:08)
the center which there should only be (62:06 - 62:10)
one and no it should not be crustal (62:08 - 62:14)
uh it should be flexing in between (62:10 - 62:17)
to help those two roles for example the (62:14 - 62:19)
jungle might come down (62:17 - 62:21)
help take out the dreadnaugh then the (62:19 - 62:23)
two people on top (62:21 - 62:26)
can then score slash push (62:23 - 62:29)
and that's pretty much why that's why (62:26 - 62:30)
like you know pikachu goes to the top (62:29 - 62:32)
pikachu is pretty good right out of the (62:30 - 62:32)
gate (62:32 - 62:35)
nine tails can go to the top because (62:32 - 62:36)
nine tails very good out of the gate (62:35 - 62:38)
nine tails could also go to the bottom (62:36 - 62:40)
like like you can put pikachu in the (62:38 - 62:41)
bottom you could put cram on the bottom (62:40 - 62:44)
i wouldn't put garchomp on top because (62:41 - 62:45)
there's not enough experience up there (62:44 - 62:46)
for garchomp (62:45 - 62:48)
but all of these roles are somewhat (62:46 - 62:49)
flexible (62:48 - 62:52)
but the game never explains like what is (62:49 - 62:54)
why why would you go to the top what (62:52 - 62:55)
should i do up there why would you go to (62:54 - 62:56)
the bottom (62:55 - 63:00)
um and so that's just like a quick (62:56 - 63:04)
like yep overview of what you're doing (63:00 - 63:07)
i mean also for the roles like if you (63:04 - 63:08)
are (63:07 - 63:11)
i i am an elder ghost player i don't (63:08 - 63:14)
kill pokemon i (63:11 - 63:17)
help you kill pokemon because it is more (63:14 - 63:18)
important that (63:17 - 63:20)
the attacker or whatever i'm paired with (63:18 - 63:22)
level up quickly (63:20 - 63:25)
and i have xp share that's building me (63:22 - 63:26)
stuff so you (63:25 - 63:28)
need to be of a higher level than i am (63:26 - 63:29)
anyways (63:28 - 63:32)
and then once i get close to four i'll (63:29 - 63:34)
kill something to push myself over (63:32 - 63:37)
but the supporter role in general is to (63:34 - 63:38)
set these things (63:37 - 63:41)
up for the person that needs to level (63:38 - 63:42)
quickly (63:41 - 63:44)
to kill and get the most experience and (63:42 - 63:45)
xp (63:44 - 63:47)
share does not give me experience for (63:45 - 63:48)
killing pokemon (63:47 - 63:52)
as an assist so i don't finish things (63:48 - 63:52)
off like (63:52 - 63:55)
if i'm running down people when you see (63:52 - 63:57)
me bring something down to a sliver (63:55 - 63:59)
and then i run past don't think i'm (63:57 - 64:01)
coming back to kill it i left it (63:59 - 64:04)
for you well that's that's not a gossip (64:01 - 64:05)
floor issue that's a (64:04 - 64:07)
issue with anyone running experience (64:05 - 64:08)
supporters well (64:07 - 64:09)
you don't have to be a supporter running (64:08 - 64:11)
experience chair there's like a (64:09 - 64:12)
bulbasaur build that runs experience (64:11 - 64:14)
share that is you know bulbasaur's an (64:12 - 64:14)
attacker but (64:14 - 64:17)
that build works really well the way you (64:14 - 64:18)
can tell somebody's running experience (64:17 - 64:19)
shares they have a little light bulb (64:18 - 64:20)
above their head (64:19 - 64:24)
yeah which is like it works (64:20 - 64:25)
like once you know what it does it's (64:24 - 64:27)
just very like in the you know (64:25 - 64:29)
20 something years of experience share i (64:27 - 64:32)
don't think light bulb (64:29 - 64:32)
no but i i agree i like it like when you (64:33 - 64:37)
see it and you know what it means it's a (64:36 - 64:38)
visual (64:37 - 64:40)
yeah yeah but i i think even more (64:38 - 64:42)
fundamentally than that like like (64:40 - 64:46)
basic basic basics like elder goss (64:42 - 64:49)
snorlax uh i think wigglytuff too (64:46 - 64:52)
falls into the category right if you are (64:49 - 64:54)
one of these (64:52 - 64:56)
your main thing is is not to to collect (64:54 - 64:58)
points and score goals (64:56 - 65:01)
no wiggles i think an attack or your (64:58 - 65:02)
mystery is it (65:01 - 65:05)
okay okay mr mime sure but your point is (65:02 - 65:06)
actually to keep (65:05 - 65:08)
the points that you're carrying as low (65:06 - 65:10)
as possible (65:08 - 65:12)
stay in front of your good attackers (65:10 - 65:13)
good scorers (65:12 - 65:17)
soak up damage even die even sacrifice (65:13 - 65:19)
yourself because if you have zero (65:17 - 65:20)
points on you and you die you're only (65:19 - 65:22)
giving them three (65:20 - 65:26)
and that way the attackers either can (65:22 - 65:27)
score with their big numbers that (65:26 - 65:28)
they've collected while you've been (65:27 - 65:30)
distracting the enemy (65:28 - 65:33)
or in your sacrifice you weakened the (65:30 - 65:36)
enemy enough that they can pick them off (65:33 - 65:38)
and then make their score right it's (65:36 - 65:40)
your goal is not to collect the big (65:38 - 65:41)
numbers (65:40 - 65:44)
you're you're good because it's you you (65:41 - 65:44)
but i (65:44 - 65:47)
would i would i would put an asterisk (65:44 - 65:48)
with what will said and said (65:47 - 65:50)
you don't want to die if you don't have (65:48 - 65:52)
to no no of course (65:50 - 65:55)
of course which i think is another (65:52 - 65:56)
problem in this game (65:55 - 66:00)
where it's this isn't like a destiny or (65:56 - 66:02)
like a call of duty where like you die (66:00 - 66:04)
and you come back and you just do it (66:02 - 66:05)
again because (66:04 - 66:10)
dying not only drops your (66:05 - 66:13)
unite orbs but it gives your opponent (66:10 - 66:15)
experience (66:13 - 66:18)
and makes them stronger so in a (66:15 - 66:20)
situation where you're like i know i (66:18 - 66:22)
can't defend (66:20 - 66:25)
this goal anymore you're almost (66:22 - 66:26)
nine times out of ten better off (66:25 - 66:28)
retreating (66:26 - 66:30)
because they're going to kill you and (66:28 - 66:32)
score anyways versus (66:30 - 66:34)
at least just scoring and you're alive (66:32 - 66:36)
and you didn't feed them experience so (66:34 - 66:38)
another a word you might hear is like (66:36 - 66:41)
don't feed them um or you're feeding (66:38 - 66:43)
right now or hey this bulbasaur is (66:41 - 66:45)
feeding me which is like (66:43 - 66:49)
this player is dying over and over (66:45 - 66:52)
and they are just benefiting the other (66:49 - 66:52)
person (66:52 - 66:56)
so much if you're in a situation where (66:52 - 66:57)
like (66:56 - 67:00)
you died and then you're on your way (66:57 - 67:00)
back (67:00 - 67:03)
your partner dies and then you get there (67:00 - 67:04)
without your partner (67:03 - 67:07)
and it's 2v1 and then you die again you (67:04 - 67:08)
have just (67:07 - 67:10)
fed them free experience and have done (67:08 - 67:11)
nothing (67:10 - 67:13)
and i get it it's a 10 minute game and (67:11 - 67:14)
you might think like (67:13 - 67:17)
i don't want to waste 15 seconds of 10 (67:14 - 67:17)
minutes i (67:17 - 67:21)
totally understand but you waiting (67:17 - 67:25)
10 seconds for your teammate (67:21 - 67:26)
and going in together so you're not (67:25 - 67:29)
feeding is way more valuable in the long (67:26 - 67:31)
run (67:29 - 67:31)
i was just going to say i think a lot of (67:32 - 67:35)
people don't know that (67:33 - 67:38)
if you can get far enough away from the (67:35 - 67:40)
bad guys (67:38 - 67:44)
uh the opposing team to a safe enough (67:40 - 67:45)
space (67:44 - 67:48)
if you hold down on the left hand (67:45 - 67:49)
direction pad (67:48 - 67:51)
that is called recall it's about four (67:49 - 67:54)
seconds and you get teleported back to (67:51 - 67:55)
your home base you instantly (67:54 - 67:58)
have your health fully refilled so if (67:55 - 67:59)
you can do that if you're very low (67:58 - 67:59)
health (67:59 - 68:02)
that's the best thing to do is to recall (67:59 - 68:03)
than to try (68:02 - 68:06)
to just stand out in a base or anything (68:03 - 68:07)
else (68:06 - 68:10)
that takes time to heal you up i think (68:07 - 68:10)
one of the (68:10 - 68:13)
one of the things that feeds people (68:10 - 68:17)
is the mvp system like there are rewards (68:13 - 68:18)
for becoming mvp and (68:17 - 68:22)
mvp only counts like (68:18 - 68:24)
i could have saved and assisted (68:22 - 68:26)
everybody but since my score is zero i (68:24 - 68:26)
am (68:26 - 68:29)
never going to be mvp and i think the (68:26 - 68:29)
mvp (68:29 - 68:32)
status and the rewards that you get from (68:29 - 68:34)
it drives behavior (68:32 - 68:37)
of i absolutely need to score (68:34 - 68:40)
as much as i can regardless of my role (68:37 - 68:45)
because i have to get that for this (68:40 - 68:47)
uh achievement for this daily mission (68:45 - 68:49)
and i don't (68:47 - 68:52)
i really do not like the aspect this (68:49 - 68:52)
aspect (68:52 - 68:55)
of the mvp aspect and the fact that they (68:52 - 68:56)
drive it (68:55 - 68:59)
to rewards because it does drive that (68:56 - 69:00)
behavior (68:59 - 69:02)
of even no matter what my role is i need (69:00 - 69:03)
to be (69:02 - 69:06)
mvp to get this accomplishment (69:03 - 69:10)
yeah i mean like i i think it (69:06 - 69:13)
can i don't think it does but it can (69:10 - 69:16)
encourage you to play other characters (69:13 - 69:19)
that's probably the intent because like (69:16 - 69:20)
it's (69:19 - 69:23)
usually the mvp is jungle like jungle is (69:20 - 69:24)
such an im (69:23 - 69:27)
like a good jungle will (69:24 - 69:31)
make or break your team um i will put (69:27 - 69:31)
this (69:31 - 69:35)
out uh mvp can happen anywhere (69:31 - 69:37)
so quick match it play all attackers and (69:35 - 69:38)
just (69:37 - 69:40)
just try your best and don't have it in (69:38 - 69:43)
your ranked i i've got an mvp on snorlax (69:40 - 69:45)
multiplayer i've got an mvp on elder (69:43 - 69:47)
goss but very rarely and (69:45 - 69:50)
only in the very beginning but like this (69:47 - 69:50)
is what (69:50 - 69:54)
um like apex did they started they did (69:50 - 69:56)
have like um (69:54 - 69:57)
they fixed it over time but they they (69:56 - 70:00)
changed they changed it to (69:57 - 70:02)
so pokemon unite and apex have the same (70:00 - 70:04)
exact battle pass (70:02 - 70:06)
which is in order to upgrade your battle (70:04 - 70:07)
pass you must do (70:06 - 70:11)
things required to you which is like (70:07 - 70:14)
win 14 matches become mvp three times (70:11 - 70:17)
apex they'll have it set up of like (70:14 - 70:21)
win become top three in a match with (70:17 - 70:21)
fuse (70:21 - 70:26)
or um have 20 people use your zip line (70:21 - 70:31)
as pathfinder or um get five knockdowns (70:26 - 70:32)
with wraith (70:31 - 70:35)
and they do it to like force you to play (70:32 - 70:37)
other characters which i think is really (70:35 - 70:39)
important in a battle royale when you're (70:37 - 70:40)
only picking three and if somebody picks (70:39 - 70:42)
wraith and you only play wraith and (70:40 - 70:43)
you're like i don't know who else to (70:42 - 70:44)
pick which is now (70:43 - 70:46)
becoming a problem in unite which is (70:44 - 70:48)
like if greg's only played elder goss (70:46 - 70:50)
and somebody picks elder goss greg is (70:48 - 70:50)
like (70:50 - 70:54)
well i'm i rage quit (70:50 - 70:57)
yeah i'm out so i take it off (70:54 - 70:58)
obviously this is their first battle (70:57 - 70:59)
pass and this is their first season but (70:58 - 71:00)
i think (70:59 - 71:02)
you know they should kind of get away (71:00 - 71:03)
from mvp i agree and they should do it (71:02 - 71:04)
like (71:03 - 71:07)
get one win with el lagos get one win (71:04 - 71:08)
with (71:07 - 71:10)
zara or uh just to encourage people to (71:08 - 71:12)
try different like you could be the (71:10 - 71:13)
worst zera aura (71:12 - 71:15)
but if your team won you've completed (71:13 - 71:16)
that achievement yeah like (71:15 - 71:18)
you really need to and i think apex does (71:16 - 71:20)
a great job at like forcing people (71:18 - 71:22)
to play characters they're they're they (71:20 - 71:23)
don't love i mean (71:22 - 71:26)
i i don't love like horizon in apex and (71:23 - 71:27)
it's like ugh i gotta do two games with (71:26 - 71:29)
horizon but it's literally (71:27 - 71:31)
do two games with horizon it's not win (71:29 - 71:33)
two games or get one it's just (71:31 - 71:36)
play two games horizon (71:33 - 71:39)
so i think and i hope that (71:36 - 71:41)
they they get to that point but yeah the (71:39 - 71:43)
mvp system is a little (71:41 - 71:45)
not great it's like it's like kind of (71:43 - 71:46)
the worst achievement (71:45 - 71:50)
yeah it's it's also frustrating like i (71:46 - 71:54)
as a support player so rarely get it (71:50 - 71:57)
and also because my numbers look low (71:54 - 71:57)
like (71:57 - 71:59)
people don't know how to read the things (71:57 - 72:01)
that i did and so they're like (71:59 - 72:04)
they won't good job they're just like (72:01 - 72:06)
well you did nothing and i'm like (72:04 - 72:10)
i kept you alive for 10 minutes (72:06 - 72:12)
yeah i mean i've been in games where you (72:10 - 72:15)
know they leave me in top lane alone and (72:12 - 72:17)
it's me versus two people (72:15 - 72:19)
and then it's like the score is over and (72:17 - 72:21)
it's it's like well i came in last and (72:19 - 72:23)
it's like well what were you doing up (72:21 - 72:24)
there and it's like (72:23 - 72:26)
i was fighting off two people like i did (72:24 - 72:28)
their chances (72:26 - 72:31)
like if anything i hopefully you guys (72:28 - 72:33)
did score a lot because i was (72:31 - 72:34)
i was holding off two people so you (72:33 - 72:36)
should have had an advantage elsewhere (72:34 - 72:38)
so i would hope you guys did what you (72:36 - 72:40)
needed to do (72:38 - 72:43)
um so i i think that (72:40 - 72:45)
it kind of makes me glad that like after (72:43 - 72:47)
a raid in pogo (72:45 - 72:50)
it doesn't say who did the most like (72:47 - 72:52)
they have the achievements now but it's (72:50 - 72:52)
not like (72:52 - 72:54)
then they're pretty random yeah and (72:52 - 72:57)
they're random but that that was a huge (72:54 - 72:59)
thing in world of warcraft (72:57 - 73:02)
where after a raid (72:59 - 73:04)
people would then target the people who (73:02 - 73:07)
didn't do well they would be like (73:04 - 73:09)
how did you only do this much or what (73:07 - 73:11)
were you doing the entire time and (73:09 - 73:12)
yeah i've seen that in league and dota (73:11 - 73:14)
where people like if they (73:12 - 73:16)
just because they didn't like the way (73:14 - 73:18)
somebody played like they didn't play (73:16 - 73:20)
well enough they get reported yeah and (73:18 - 73:21)
i'm exactly (73:20 - 73:24)
garbagey uh like one of the most (73:21 - 73:26)
frustrating aspects of what (73:24 - 73:28)
one of many one of them was people who (73:26 - 73:30)
would watch dps meters (73:28 - 73:32)
and be like you're only putting out this (73:30 - 73:33)
much you need to be putting out this (73:32 - 73:34)
much which (73:33 - 73:37)
one thing that i um i've always loved (73:34 - 73:37)
about (73:37 - 73:41)
final fantasy 14 is that that's banned (73:37 - 73:43)
and if the company finds out you're (73:41 - 73:46)
using a mod to check dps meters uh (73:43 - 73:49)
your account will be banned (73:46 - 73:52)
it's not just a conversation of you're a (73:49 - 73:54)
healer you should be doing dps as well (73:52 - 73:55)
and then it's like (73:54 - 73:59)
just settle down i mean (73:55 - 74:02)
if you're sitting with a full mana bar (73:59 - 74:04)
and none of us are hurt (74:02 - 74:06)
toss the dps in there i know you have a (74:04 - 74:07)
spell for it (74:06 - 74:12)
yeah yeah yeah just one help us do this (74:07 - 74:12)
faster (74:13 - 74:16)
i think the um (74:16 - 74:19)
i think there's like lots of talk about (74:20 - 74:25)
characters being unbalanced (74:23 - 74:29)
or characters being strong i think (74:25 - 74:30)
i i definitely see where people are (74:29 - 74:33)
coming from but (74:30 - 74:36)
like to to try to adjust characters (74:33 - 74:37)
after two weeks of (74:36 - 74:41)
data seems not good (74:37 - 74:45)
um one because like it's very (74:41 - 74:48)
easy to be like gengar is too strong (74:45 - 74:50)
when you've only been playing the game (74:48 - 74:51)
for like two hours (74:50 - 74:56)
i mean i i have no idea how gengar can (74:51 - 74:58)
suddenly appear and in two seconds i'm (74:56 - 74:59)
dead (74:58 - 75:02)
poison what happened (74:59 - 75:05)
i didn't even see anything happen and (75:02 - 75:06)
now i'm dead (75:05 - 75:08)
what happened but i can't say that that (75:06 - 75:10)
character is overpowered i just don't (75:08 - 75:12)
understand what happened like (75:10 - 75:15)
i i don't get it yet one thing (75:12 - 75:18)
that i've discussed with my moba playing (75:15 - 75:19)
friends (75:18 - 75:21)
um and and we kind of all haven't agreed (75:19 - 75:23)
to on the concept of (75:21 - 75:25)
this character is overpowered you know (75:23 - 75:27)
it's unbalanced (75:25 - 75:30)
the the key feature that i think of (75:27 - 75:31)
pokemon unite (75:30 - 75:35)
that is intended as a balancing aspect (75:31 - 75:39)
is technically every team (75:35 - 75:42)
has access to the same pokemon (75:39 - 75:46)
set to pick from and (75:42 - 75:49)
each team can have this if if zera aura (75:46 - 75:52)
is the best pokemon in the game both (75:49 - 75:54)
teams can have a zero aura (75:52 - 75:56)
there's not it's not like we pick it and (75:54 - 75:58)
you guys can't have it (75:56 - 76:01)
and that's the balancing mechanic yeah (75:58 - 76:05)
um there there's also like i heard (76:01 - 76:06)
somebody for the first time say like (76:05 - 76:09)
oh they really need to nerf snorlax and (76:06 - 76:10)
i was like (76:09 - 76:12)
what what (76:10 - 76:12)
as of this recording i played 160 games (76:13 - 76:18)
i would probably say (76:16 - 76:21)
140 of those were ranked (76:18 - 76:24)
i can't say i'm having a good time with (76:21 - 76:25)
ranked i can't say i'm having a bad time (76:24 - 76:26)
with ranked (76:25 - 76:28)
i'm having a time with rank there's (76:26 - 76:30)
going back there's time with ranked i (76:28 - 76:32)
explained why i play ranked over casual (76:30 - 76:33)
though i like seeing (76:32 - 76:37)
myself become a better player (76:33 - 76:42)
but like the other problem with balance (76:37 - 76:46)
is that we don't know if the gengar or (76:42 - 76:47)
the snorlax you are fighting (76:46 - 76:50)
has paid to win we don't know if they (76:47 - 76:52)
have 30 30 30 on it and if they do (76:50 - 76:54)
i'm gonna go back to my clash royale (76:52 - 76:56)
argument (76:54 - 76:57)
just kind of shrug my shoulders they (76:56 - 76:59)
paid a hundred dollars to get this win (76:57 - 77:00)
off of you (76:59 - 77:02)
don't feel bad about it let them enjoy (77:00 - 77:04)
their game (77:02 - 77:06)
uh i mean eventually i i don't i'm not (77:04 - 77:08)
defending pedowin i think it's (77:06 - 77:10)
i still think it sucks that that is (77:08 - 77:11)
there (77:10 - 77:13)
i i wish they would have just added more (77:11 - 77:14)
clothes or (77:13 - 77:17)
more outfits i know that's hard and i'm (77:14 - 77:19)
sure that has to be (77:17 - 77:20)
i'm sure that's hard on a designer (77:19 - 77:22)
aspect and i'm sure that's hard in (77:20 - 77:24)
getting it approved by the pokemon (77:22 - 77:25)
company aspect (77:24 - 77:28)
of they have to approve these clothes uh (77:25 - 77:28)
hopefully (77:28 - 77:31)
as the game ages and there's more close (77:28 - 77:32)
they get away from the pay to win like (77:31 - 77:33)
league did (77:32 - 77:35)
league had paid to win they got away (77:33 - 77:38)
from it um (77:35 - 77:38)
but right now it exists so like it is (77:38 - 77:44)
completely possible where like i fought (77:42 - 77:46)
a zera aura i was there aurora that was (77:44 - 77:48)
a hard match up because there are auras (77:46 - 77:49)
discharge requires you just be standing (77:48 - 77:51)
right next to them (77:49 - 77:53)
which for xerora you don't want to be (77:51 - 77:54)
standing next to because they have (77:53 - 77:56)
discharge but i need to stand next to (77:54 - 77:57)
that zero because they have discharge (77:56 - 78:00)
and to me it was clear that they not (77:57 - 78:02)
that they were pay to win but they (78:00 - 78:04)
leveled up their held items and i did (78:02 - 78:05)
not (78:04 - 78:10)
and i lost that encounter every time um (78:05 - 78:10)
and that's fine but i i i i feel like (78:10 - 78:13)
people (78:13 - 78:15)
lose to a character and the first thing (78:13 - 78:18)
they go is like oh this is not balanced (78:15 - 78:21)
i and i want to address uh the listeners (78:18 - 78:23)
that i am particularly and disappointed (78:21 - 78:23)
in (78:23 - 78:27)
for the past week and if if i'm lying (78:23 - 78:30)
if i'm wrong show me my lie show me i'm (78:27 - 78:32)
wrong because we got a number of (78:30 - 78:33)
responses (78:32 - 78:36)
after our discussion of the pay to win (78:33 - 78:37)
where people were like oh (78:36 - 78:39)
i guess they didn't know that if you try (78:37 - 78:40)
to get a held (78:39 - 78:42)
item and you don't have enough of (78:40 - 78:44)
whatever first currency is i don't (78:42 - 78:46)
remember the name of it (78:44 - 78:48)
it like automatically asks you if you (78:46 - 78:52)
want to use tickets to get the held item (78:48 - 78:54)
then no not the held item it's the (78:52 - 78:55)
purple thing (78:54 - 78:58)
okay it's the boosters the okay so but (78:55 - 79:01)
you have to go to some other area to get (78:58 - 79:03)
specifically get those boosters so you (79:01 - 79:04)
have to go to the store to get the (79:03 - 79:05)
boosters (79:04 - 79:08)
and so i'll like like a character it'll (79:05 - 79:08)
say (79:08 - 79:12)
it'll say 10 000 coins slash (79:08 - 79:15)
um 600 gems or whatever (79:12 - 79:18)
for the booster it only says 10 tickets (79:15 - 79:20)
it doesn't say anything else so yes (79:18 - 79:22)
listeners did point this out (79:20 - 79:25)
if you spend all of your tickets (79:22 - 79:28)
and you have zero tickets then the (79:25 - 79:30)
booster will randomly say (79:28 - 79:33)
you can buy one booster for eight gems (79:30 - 79:36)
okay but it will never tell you that (79:33 - 79:38)
unless you are a completely out of (79:36 - 79:39)
tickets (79:38 - 79:44)
and which is like kind of weird (79:39 - 79:46)
because like like it is pay to win (79:44 - 79:48)
obviously it is the quickest way to pay (79:46 - 79:48)
to win (79:48 - 79:51)
but your it forces you to burn one of (79:48 - 79:53)
your currencies that you have to earn (79:51 - 79:56)
to then force you to pay which i don't (79:53 - 79:57)
know if they're doing that to like (79:56 - 79:59)
punish you into like wasting your (79:57 - 80:00)
tickets because you can use your tickets (79:59 - 80:03)
for other things (80:00 - 80:06)
um but yeah you have to you cannot (80:03 - 80:09)
pay to win that part of the game without (80:06 - 80:10)
burning all your tickets (80:09 - 80:12)
and then it's eight gems which i don't (80:10 - 80:14)
know what that equates to like i don't (80:12 - 80:16)
know if eight gems is a dollar or (80:14 - 80:18)
50 cents or a quarter i'm not sure but (80:16 - 80:19)
it's eight gems per (80:18 - 80:22)
one booster first i think they're 10 (80:19 - 80:22)
tickets right (80:22 - 80:24)
yeah the 10 units yeah because you get (80:22 - 80:26)
50 for 500. (80:24 - 80:27)
yeah well that's that's also if you're (80:26 - 80:29)
going in and buying those boosters (80:27 - 80:33)
and not just using the ones that you get (80:29 - 80:35)
as rewards for as you play through the (80:33 - 80:36)
game (80:35 - 80:39)
yeah because if you're just going in (80:36 - 80:43)
and you're boostering a held item (80:39 - 80:46)
yes right when you run out of those it (80:43 - 80:47)
doesn't say anything (80:46 - 80:49)
it doesn't even say go to the store and (80:47 - 80:50)
buy more boosters doesn't it it just (80:49 - 80:50)
says (80:50 - 80:52)
you don't have enough you don't have (80:50 - 80:53)
enough boosters (80:52 - 80:56)
so yeah it is it is weird that they they (80:53 - 80:57)
they (80:56 - 80:59)
like have that loophole or that hidden (80:57 - 81:01)
feature it (80:59 - 81:03)
you would think that like if they just (81:01 - 81:05)
wanted money they would just put gems on (81:03 - 81:06)
it and call it a day (81:05 - 81:09)
but if their goal is to make you waste (81:06 - 81:10)
your tickets (81:09 - 81:12)
before you spend your money i don't know (81:10 - 81:13)
if that's their way of throttling it but (81:12 - 81:14)
why do they care (81:13 - 81:16)
like if somebody wants to pay to win (81:14 - 81:17)
like it just (81:16 - 81:21)
it seems very weird um and i like (81:17 - 81:23)
at a certain point other people will (81:21 - 81:24)
catch up right (81:23 - 81:26)
like in a year maybe everyone will have (81:24 - 81:27)
30 30 (81:26 - 81:29)
30 on their held items which is the max (81:27 - 81:31)
level is 30 right now (81:29 - 81:32)
well and there will be that one person (81:31 - 81:34)
is like i only want to play this one (81:32 - 81:36)
pokemon (81:34 - 81:39)
ever i will max out the items for the (81:36 - 81:41)
best build for that pokemon (81:39 - 81:43)
and i am done wash my hands right that's (81:41 - 81:44)
yeah (81:43 - 81:46)
the fastest and easiest way to do it for (81:44 - 81:48)
free (81:46 - 81:48)
yeah but even at after 160 battles i (81:48 - 81:52)
have not a single item at 30. (81:50 - 81:56)
and i've only upgraded four items i (81:52 - 81:57)
upgraded to float stone which i (81:56 - 81:59)
don't use anymore that float stones i (81:57 - 82:00)
think at 15. (81:59 - 82:04)
i did the buddy barrier um choice specs (82:00 - 82:07)
and then like wise glasses or something (82:04 - 82:09)
i don't remember the last one but (82:07 - 82:12)
it's it's it's hard to get a item to 30. (82:09 - 82:13)
like it's (82:12 - 82:14)
pretty easy to get into 10 and it's a (82:13 - 82:16)
little bit more difficult to get it to (82:14 - 82:17)
20 but it's very hard to get an item to (82:16 - 82:18)
30. so (82:17 - 82:20)
and you also didn't make the mistake (82:18 - 82:22)
that i did where i was like (82:20 - 82:24)
i'm gonna play talonflame talonflame's (82:22 - 82:26)
gonna be great and then you find out (82:24 - 82:28)
hey there's no build of talonflame (82:26 - 82:30)
that's great but snorlax you do pretty (82:28 - 82:32)
well with oh but i wasted all my upgrade (82:30 - 82:34)
tickets on items for talonflames yeah i (82:32 - 82:35)
got that and they don't (82:34 - 82:38)
translate to snorlax i i won the lottery (82:35 - 82:39)
though (82:38 - 82:44)
i got the talonflame hollow thing oh man (82:39 - 82:45)
and i'm like i will never play this (82:44 - 82:47)
character treat it to me (82:45 - 82:49)
i wish i could and that's why i've been (82:47 - 82:51)
making those graphics on like twitter (82:49 - 82:53)
and instagram to like help people (82:51 - 82:55)
feel confident about the held items they (82:53 - 82:56)
pick because if you are trying to be (82:55 - 82:58)
free to play (82:56 - 83:00)
i get it i i have not i i have put money (82:58 - 83:02)
into the game i have only bought a (83:00 - 83:05)
character i bought kramer ant and i've (83:02 - 83:06)
bought the 20 (83:05 - 83:08)
cramer ant raincoat that's it i have not (83:06 - 83:09)
put my money (83:08 - 83:11)
i think i bought one of the like the (83:09 - 83:12)
coin boosters or something for science i (83:11 - 83:14)
was like i don't know what was this 200 (83:12 - 83:15)
gems i don't know what it does okay (83:14 - 83:16)
boost coins (83:15 - 83:18)
don't ever buy that by the way you only (83:16 - 83:19)
get 2 000 coins a week (83:18 - 83:22)
if you're playing like 20 matches (83:19 - 83:25)
don't ever buy the coin booster i spent (83:22 - 83:28)
the 200 gems for science don't ever buy (83:25 - 83:28)
it (83:28 - 83:30)
but i guess the only reason you would (83:28 - 83:32)
buy coin booster is if you want (83:30 - 83:34)
2 000 coins a week which is your limit (83:32 - 83:36)
and you can only play one day (83:34 - 83:39)
a week i guess that would make sense i (83:36 - 83:40)
guess (83:39 - 83:45)
but don't buy the coin booster ever um (83:40 - 83:45)
so the reason i was making those (83:46 - 83:49)
graphics is to be helpful because if you (83:47 - 83:50)
are free to play (83:49 - 83:52)
and you're like i really like snorlax (83:50 - 83:54)
and i really like i don't know elder (83:52 - 83:56)
goss (83:54 - 83:56)
if you only have so many upgrades (83:56 - 84:00)
you you don't want to put them in the (83:59 - 84:02)
wrong thing like will did you don't put (84:00 - 84:04)
your upgrades into things for talonflame (84:02 - 84:05)
and then realize those things on (84:04 - 84:06)
talonflame don't work on snorlax and (84:05 - 84:08)
another problem is like people don't (84:06 - 84:08)
know (84:08 - 84:10)
what they should put on um especially (84:08 - 84:11)
because the game is kind of confusing (84:10 - 84:12)
with (84:11 - 84:15)
special attack and physical attack um (84:12 - 84:17)
like even though kramer ant is a special (84:15 - 84:19)
attacker (84:17 - 84:22)
uh it's like aracudos are like special (84:19 - 84:24)
but it's actual moves like whirlpool (84:22 - 84:25)
surf or like (84:24 - 84:27)
or sorry the arakutas are physical the (84:25 - 84:29)
whirlpool the hurricane the surf those (84:27 - 84:30)
are special so (84:29 - 84:31)
obviously like the special is more (84:30 - 84:34)
important um (84:31 - 84:36)
like nine tails is kind of the one that (84:34 - 84:37)
is like split (84:36 - 84:40)
uh because like it's it's (84:37 - 84:44)
normal move that it attacks is (84:40 - 84:45)
physical but that move is really good (84:44 - 84:47)
because if you do it like three times (84:45 - 84:49)
they eventually like freeze and then (84:47 - 84:49)
it's (84:49 - 84:51)
it's it's like dazzling gleam especially (84:49 - 84:53)
so like nine tails is weird because it (84:51 - 84:55)
can benefit both from muscle band and (84:53 - 84:57)
wise glasses one being a physical (84:55 - 84:58)
increase one being special (84:57 - 85:02)
even though ideally (84:58 - 85:04)
nine tails is a special attacker so it (85:02 - 85:06)
it is very weird and i'm trying to i (85:04 - 85:07)
make those graphics to hopefully clear (85:06 - 85:08)
that up (85:07 - 85:11)
and i'm planning on making graphics like (85:08 - 85:13)
hey if you're going in the jungle (85:11 - 85:14)
and you're going to be a zero or an (85:13 - 85:17)
absol here's kind of like the pokemon (85:14 - 85:18)
order to do (85:17 - 85:20)
and what you want to do and um maybe (85:18 - 85:21)
these are the pokemon that are (85:20 - 85:22)
recommended for top (85:21 - 85:25)
and why they're recommended for top so (85:22 - 85:29)
i know i'm not the best unite player (85:25 - 85:29)
uh but i'm trying to help (85:30 - 85:36)
other people be better and i don't have (85:33 - 85:36)
to be (85:36 - 85:39)
a world-class player to look at stats of (85:36 - 85:41)
world class players and try to break (85:39 - 85:42)
that down to make it easy to consume for (85:41 - 85:45)
people (85:42 - 85:45)
unite is fun though i think i think (85:47 - 85:55)
it is it is incredibly fun i think that (85:50 - 85:59)
i think that it has legs (85:55 - 86:01)
um i don't think this is i the weird (85:59 - 86:02)
thing i was (86:01 - 86:06)
i was telling i think i was telling um (86:02 - 86:07)
another friend about this the weird (86:06 - 86:09)
thing about me streaming unite (86:07 - 86:13)
is like like (86:09 - 86:15)
obviously main series pokemon games are (86:13 - 86:16)
kind of like bread and butter (86:15 - 86:18)
because people get they're because they (86:16 - 86:20)
attract the most people (86:18 - 86:23)
um but when you when you (86:20 - 86:25)
take a detour and you play like pokemon (86:23 - 86:27)
snap or (86:25 - 86:30)
um was another pokemon game that (86:27 - 86:30)
recently (86:30 - 86:33)
came out that or like detective pikachu (86:30 - 86:35)
on the 3ds (86:33 - 86:37)
those games have an end point they have (86:35 - 86:39)
credits they're like done (86:37 - 86:41)
but like pokemon unites kind of weird (86:39 - 86:42)
because there is no end point there's (86:41 - 86:43)
going to be a season two there's (86:42 - 86:44)
probably going to be a season three (86:43 - 86:45)
there's going to be more characters (86:44 - 86:47)
there's probably going to be balances (86:45 - 86:50)
they're probably gonna i would assume (86:47 - 86:52)
change out zapdos for articuno in the (86:50 - 86:54)
future or mall trace in the future (86:52 - 86:57)
uh or maybe just they (86:54 - 86:59)
10 really love zapdos i'm not 100 sure (86:57 - 87:00)
on that (86:59 - 87:03)
lugia and ho raids will come back (87:00 - 87:06)
ah yes but i (87:03 - 87:11)
i i don't think unite is going anywhere (87:06 - 87:14)
in like pokemon go (87:11 - 87:16)
i don't pokemon go didn't go anywhere (87:14 - 87:18)
it's here it's very dominant (87:16 - 87:19)
i mean at this point you either like (87:18 - 87:22)
pokemon go or you don't (87:19 - 87:22)
but my goal with at least with unite is (87:23 - 87:26)
to (87:26 - 87:31)
help people get into unite (87:26 - 87:33)
and to because i think once you (87:31 - 87:35)
understand it better and once your (87:33 - 87:37)
teammates understand it better you'll (87:35 - 87:38)
have more fun with it (87:37 - 87:40)
instead of four people trying their (87:38 - 87:42)
hardest and then one alolan nine tails (87:40 - 87:43)
sitting in the base (87:42 - 87:47)
spamming concede concede concede (87:43 - 87:48)
when it's only been like two minutes (87:47 - 87:50)
it's been two minutes it's been (87:48 - 87:52)
two minutes we haven't even gotten to (87:50 - 87:55)
zapdos yet and just go to zapdos (87:52 - 87:57)
like it's important to not let people (87:55 - 88:01)
get it as it is to get it (87:57 - 88:04)
let me make a call out to (88:01 - 88:07)
some some folks out there who who need (88:04 - 88:08)
to understand (88:07 - 88:12)
one thing i had one of our listeners (88:08 - 88:16)
our friend paul text me he said (88:12 - 88:20)
me and my boyfriend and greg and you we (88:16 - 88:22)
need to get together and play unite (88:20 - 88:22)
together (88:22 - 88:25)
and my response to him was that is never (88:22 - 88:27)
going to happen (88:25 - 88:30)
because i enjoy playing unite (88:27 - 88:33)
i will not schedule time to play unite (88:30 - 88:35)
what if i'm either playing it i'm (88:33 - 88:37)
playing it if i'm not playing it (88:35 - 88:38)
i'm not playing it it's not what what i (88:37 - 88:40)
was asking greg about before it's not (88:38 - 88:44)
appointment television (88:40 - 88:45)
not gonna schedule a time with you to (88:44 - 88:48)
play unite if i'm playing unite and i (88:45 - 88:49)
see you online (88:48 - 88:51)
sure i'll join a team or something like (88:49 - 88:52)
that (88:51 - 88:55)
and guess what folks that is okay if (88:52 - 88:57)
that's the way you enjoy playing unite (88:55 - 88:59)
you can dip in and dip out you are (88:57 - 89:00)
perfectly fine (88:59 - 89:03)
and you're able to play unite that way (89:00 - 89:04)
i'm also (89:03 - 89:06)
not going to put a lot of money or any (89:04 - 89:07)
money into unite (89:06 - 89:09)
and if that's the way you want to play (89:07 - 89:11)
unite you're not going to win a lot (89:09 - 89:13)
but it's still if you're having fun (89:11 - 89:14)
going out there and (89:13 - 89:16)
doing just running around that field as (89:14 - 89:18)
your favorite pokemon (89:16 - 89:19)
if your favorite pokemon's in there (89:18 - 89:21)
that's perfectly okay too (89:19 - 89:23)
if you're having fun that's what the (89:21 - 89:25)
game is for (89:23 - 89:28)
that's my uh what is it uh the more you (89:25 - 89:28)
know (89:28 - 89:33)
[Laughter] (89:28 - 89:33)
okay we'll do lightning round question (89:36 - 89:39)
of the week (89:37 - 89:41)
oh we are here hold on we're here i i (89:39 - 89:43)
got some questions we can (89:41 - 89:46)
we can burn through them and then (89:43 - 89:50)
to remind you to ask the (89:46 - 89:54)
question of the week (89:50 - 89:54)
all right we'll do youtube first this is (89:54 - 89:58)
from the cheese man (89:56 - 89:59)
how do you feel about the pokemon (89:58 - 90:01)
outfits in unite how do you feel about (89:59 - 90:02)
the battle pass (90:01 - 90:04)
would you buy the entire battle pass if (90:02 - 90:07)
you had an option (90:04 - 90:09)
i'll let you guys go first like are we (90:07 - 90:11)
saying to buy the entire battlefield get (90:09 - 90:15)
all 30 things done (90:11 - 90:15)
uh you well you can answer if you bought (90:15 - 90:19)
the battle pass or not (90:18 - 90:21)
and then i bought the battle pass and (90:19 - 90:22)
would you max it out with money (90:21 - 90:26)
no i wouldn't (90:22 - 90:30)
also i really wish the guard of our (90:26 - 90:34)
outfit was better i i'm not a fan of it (90:30 - 90:34)
i want (90:34 - 90:37)
it could be cute and it's just the way (90:34 - 90:38)
they designed it it's like a five dollar (90:37 - 90:39)
outfit (90:38 - 90:41)
yeah it's just not it's just a weird the (90:39 - 90:43)
bonnet fits really weird and the (90:41 - 90:46)
frilly thing is just it's the coloring (90:43 - 90:47)
is not right it's just (90:46 - 90:50)
i'm not into it so (90:47 - 90:53)
number one didn't buy the battle pass (90:50 - 90:54)
will not buy the battle pass (90:53 - 90:58)
number two i got the al (90:54 - 91:00)
black shirt black shorts black shoes (90:58 - 91:01)
i've got my outfit (91:00 - 91:04)
i'm done i don't need i'm not buying any (91:01 - 91:05)
clothes (91:04 - 91:08)
costumes they don't matter to me sorry (91:05 - 91:10)
um (91:08 - 91:10)
how do you would you buy the entire (91:10 - 91:14)
battle pass bought the battle pass (91:12 - 91:16)
i will never max it out i think in i've (91:14 - 91:18)
only the only time i've ever paid to (91:16 - 91:20)
increase a battle pass level was (91:18 - 91:22)
um in apex legends where it ended in (91:20 - 91:24)
like two hours and i was two levels away (91:22 - 91:26)
from maxing out the battle pass so i (91:24 - 91:27)
bought the two levels which (91:26 - 91:30)
ended up being like six bucks but that (91:27 - 91:32)
was literally because it was like 5 a.m (91:30 - 91:34)
and the battle pass ended at 6 a.m and i (91:32 - 91:35)
was so tired and i was like i'm not (91:34 - 91:37)
doing any more games with apex (91:35 - 91:39)
i'm just gonna spend the six dollars and (91:37 - 91:40)
i'm going to bed (91:39 - 91:42)
um as long as i'm actively playing a (91:40 - 91:44)
game and enjoying it i know i will (91:42 - 91:45)
complete the battle pass (91:44 - 91:47)
and if i'm not completing the battle (91:45 - 91:49)
pass to me it's because i'm not enjoying (91:47 - 91:51)
the game (91:49 - 91:53)
and so why would i give it money if i'm (91:51 - 91:54)
not enjoying it (91:53 - 91:55)
how do you feel about the outfits in (91:54 - 91:57)
unite love them i (91:55 - 92:00)
really can't wait to see more um how do (91:57 - 92:01)
you feel about the battle pass skins (92:00 - 92:05)
i think 95 percent of the current battle (92:01 - 92:07)
pass is hot garbage (92:05 - 92:10)
there's way too many socks uh there's (92:07 - 92:13)
so many socks this is from the person (92:10 - 92:15)
that complained because pokemon go (92:13 - 92:16)
didn't have any socks now we've got the (92:15 - 92:18)
inverse and you're also complaining (92:16 - 92:21)
the the first battle pass in unite has (92:18 - 92:24)
more socks than pokemon go could ever (92:21 - 92:25)
catch up with in five years at this (92:24 - 92:26)
point (92:25 - 92:29)
which is like we got way too many socks (92:26 - 92:31)
what is the like tube situation (92:29 - 92:34)
on not though enough leg tubes there are (92:31 - 92:35)
no leg tubes (92:34 - 92:38)
the the pikachu stuff and the cinderace (92:35 - 92:41)
skin i feel like alone make the battle (92:38 - 92:42)
pass worth it (92:41 - 92:44)
because yeah like pikachu outfit but (92:42 - 92:47)
everything up to that point is like (92:44 - 92:50)
real filler um (92:47 - 92:51)
[Music] (92:50 - 92:54)
so yeah i i hope it's the first battle (92:51 - 92:55)
pass so i'm giving (92:54 - 92:56)
a first battle pass i'm giving them a (92:55 - 92:58)
pass (92:56 - 92:59)
and i hope that the second one will be (92:58 - 93:02)
better but (92:59 - 93:02)
overall i think like the cosmetics in (93:02 - 93:06)
the game are really strong (93:04 - 93:08)
there are more there are more hits than (93:06 - 93:09)
yeah there are more hits than misses (93:08 - 93:13)
yeah i i want to see well i mean (93:09 - 93:14)
some characteristics don't have any yet (93:13 - 93:17)
so i would like to see (93:14 - 93:23)
everybody get some yeah (93:17 - 93:25)
uh this is from patrick uh from our (93:23 - 93:27)
slack community which pokemon would you (93:25 - 93:29)
add to unite and which type of character (93:27 - 93:30)
would you make them greg you're not (93:29 - 93:31)
allowed to pick rose (93:30 - 93:33)
the rosary line because you feel like (93:31 - 93:35)
you said that like two weeks ago (93:33 - 93:37)
i did so repeat the question which (93:35 - 93:38)
character (93:37 - 93:40)
which pokemon would you add and which (93:38 - 93:42)
pokemon would you add (93:40 - 93:44)
and what would they be a speedster (93:42 - 93:45)
attacker a defender i (93:44 - 93:48)
want i have two (93:45 - 93:52)
two things i want the mammoth swine line (93:48 - 93:55)
as defenders okay and i want (93:52 - 93:57)
sable eye as a speedster because he'd be (93:55 - 94:00)
running around jungkook (93:57 - 94:00)
i could see it i could see it foul play (94:02 - 94:06)
all right all right will (94:07 - 94:12)
this is a tough question there's a lot (94:10 - 94:14)
of pokemon out there (94:12 - 94:17)
to pick from i immediately was thinking (94:14 - 94:18)
mimikyu but (94:17 - 94:21)
mimikyu's just uh another gengar (94:18 - 94:25)
so and another pikachu for that matter (94:21 - 94:28)
i think uh the scoloped line would be (94:25 - 94:29)
really cool (94:28 - 94:31)
benipe and worlapeed skulloped i guess (94:29 - 94:34)
they would probably be an attacker (94:31 - 94:35)
because skulloped is pretty fast hits (94:34 - 94:37)
pretty hard (94:35 - 94:40)
we don't have enough water pokemon yeah (94:37 - 94:44)
or any water pokemon slowpoke (94:40 - 94:46)
i think that's it right yeah yeah those (94:44 - 94:48)
are like (94:46 - 94:50)
water pokemon i mean i'm talking can we (94:48 - 94:51)
get a waylord (94:50 - 94:54)
out here it just takes something like (94:51 - 94:54)
that (94:54 - 94:56)
picks up the entire jungle there's a (94:54 - 94:58)
whale right in the middle (94:56 - 95:01)
try to get past me (94:58 - 95:04)
i don't know boy (95:01 - 95:04)
you know what let's let's do um (95:04 - 95:11)
reuniklus (95:08 - 95:11)
if some freaky psychic stuff going on (95:12 - 95:18)
re-unique list probably support i would (95:15 - 95:19)
assume (95:18 - 95:22)
yeah no it's like it's going to be on (95:19 - 95:23)
the edge where you could build it one (95:22 - 95:25)
way or the other (95:23 - 95:28)
an all-arounder a jungle (95:25 - 95:30)
yeah there you go get your view nicholas (95:28 - 95:32)
in the jungle move over crystal (95:30 - 95:37)
we got a new jungle okay we're uniquely (95:32 - 95:37)
uh pokemon of the week all right so last (95:38 - 95:43)
week's pokemon there was a long long (95:41 - 95:44)
story about (95:43 - 95:47)
basically me getting food poisoning (95:44 - 95:51)
from i suspect probably it wasn't (95:47 - 95:53)
the sushi place we went to it was (95:51 - 95:55)
probably the fried chicken place i went (95:53 - 95:57)
to the night before (95:55 - 96:00)
um but i basically said that a pokemon (95:57 - 96:02)
tried to poison me because (96:00 - 96:05)
nick burgess was eating weird stuff (96:02 - 96:12)
that's the whole story okay all right (96:05 - 96:16)
so who is it is (96:12 - 96:19)
coughing i wrote down (96:16 - 96:25)
galerion slow king galerian slow king (96:19 - 96:25)
the whole story was about me getting (96:30 - 96:33)
sick oh i mean oh do you care about the (96:31 - 96:35)
the mask over its face yes yeah i (96:33 - 96:37)
remember the mask (96:35 - 96:39)
it has the black cape instead of the (96:37 - 96:41)
little crowd clown frill (96:39 - 96:45)
around it yeah yeah isn't it really like (96:41 - 96:45)
there's a lot on this page for sloppy (96:47 - 96:50)
valerian slow king (96:48 - 96:53)
design is so good but also (96:50 - 96:56)
so completely terrifying at the same (96:53 - 96:58)
time like i really like it but also when (96:56 - 97:00)
you just look at it you're like oh boy (96:58 - 97:02)
that thing's eating its head it's it's (97:00 - 97:05)
not in control anymore (97:02 - 97:08)
oh it's not like a parasect it's not (97:05 - 97:09)
that bad (97:08 - 97:10)
it's not that bad but it could be we (97:09 - 97:12)
don't know what's going on underneath (97:10 - 97:12)
there (97:12 - 97:15)
no pokemon has the same type combination (97:12 - 97:17)
as gallerian slobro and gallerian slow (97:15 - 97:18)
king (97:17 - 97:22)
in the tcg slow kings southern island (97:18 - 97:25)
card is the only card depicting pokemon (97:22 - 97:29)
introduced after gen 1 to have a square (97:25 - 97:32)
evolution box in japan only (97:29 - 97:34)
and the english version the southern (97:32 - 97:35)
island collection (97:34 - 97:38)
we used the neo-era designs which (97:35 - 97:40)
like all later card layouts featured a (97:38 - 97:44)
circular evolution box (97:40 - 97:47)
ju the johto slow king shares the (97:44 - 97:48)
category with pyroar (97:47 - 97:53)
they're both known as the royal pokemon (97:48 - 97:56)

charizard right monetary (99:21 - 99:28)
monetary (99:25 - 99:28)
they're so bad at names this company (99:32 - 99:37)
that's why they stopped making megas (99:35 - 99:39)
this is exactly why they stopped making (99:37 - 99:40)
them said these (99:39 - 99:42)
these are real bad are you ready for the (99:40 - 99:43)
next pokemon yeah (99:42 - 99:45)
maybe they just cut megas because they (99:43 - 99:47)
were like (99:45 - 99:48)
we really messed up with the names we (99:47 - 99:50)
can't keep doing this all right (99:48 - 99:53)
next week's pokemon according to a (99:50 - 99:54)
recent instagram (99:53 - 99:57)
post from a pokemon influencer this was (99:54 - 99:59)
the most requested pokemon for a (99:57 - 100:00)
featured master set (99:59 - 100:03)
the set is comprised of focus band and (100:00 - 100:04)
muscle band (100:03 - 100:06)
with which the average pokemon player (100:04 - 100:07)
will be familiar (100:06 - 100:10)
and also the new held item buddy barrier (100:07 - 100:13)
which will not be found in other pokemon (100:10 - 100:14)
games (100:13 - 100:15)
while many people like to argue that (100:14 - 100:18)
this pokemon is based on a cat (100:15 - 100:20)
it is more likely based on a hibernating (100:18 - 100:22)
bear (100:20 - 100:24)
the benefit of using buddy barrier is if (100:22 - 100:26)
you are at zapdos (100:24 - 100:28)
you can alt which has an aoe that (100:26 - 100:30)
damages all nearby opponents while the (100:28 - 100:32)
buddy barrier protects (100:30 - 100:35)
you and your lowest hp teammate (100:32 - 100:37)
in reference to previous pokemon of the (100:35 - 100:39)
week this week's pokemon can only learn (100:37 - 100:41)
toxic if transferred from a previous (100:39 - 100:42)
generation (100:41 - 100:44)
that's a little fact you didn't know (100:42 - 100:46)
right there all right (100:44 - 100:49)
really yeah they like (100:46 - 100:52)
got rid of toxic on like 90 of pokemon (100:49 - 100:52)
and geller (100:52 - 100:55)
yeah for the best does it keep it (100:52 - 100:58)
does it yeah yeah if you download it out (100:55 - 101:00)
of home it can have toxic (100:58 - 101:04)
huh is that allowed (101:00 - 101:07)
yeah maybe i don't know thank you for (101:04 - 101:09)
listening thank you for making it to the (101:07 - 101:09)
end (101:09 - 101:13)

next week we'll be able to talk about (101:13 - 101:19)

players in chat that can give you (101:44 - 101:49)
advice as well i i would say that like (101:46 - 101:51)
i've only had in the last week i've only (101:49 - 101:53)

admit they're dota players in front of (102:06 - 102:09)
other league players why (102:07 - 102:11)
those league players they're ruthless (102:09 - 102:12)
