okay we got a a show for you guys today (1:32 - 1:37)
we have some anime news some TCG news (1:35 - 1:40)
there was a brand new Blissey event that (1:37 - 1:41)
came and went but I think it's worth (1:40 - 1:44)
talking about and there were some awards (1:41 - 1:47)
that happened in Japan and uh you know I (1:44 - 1:49)
was broken as Scarlett and violet did it (1:47 - 1:51)
it won some awards I think it won the (1:49 - 1:55)
correct Awards I think I think so too (1:51 - 1:58)
[Laughter] (1:55 - 1:58)
um so uh I guess we'll just start things (1:58 - 2:04)
off with the Pokemon anime (2:01 - 2:06)
uh which is (2:04 - 2:09)
uh this is off the pokemon.com Pokemon (2:06 - 2:14)
reveals Pokemon Horizons the series (2:09 - 2:16)
as the official title of the next anime (2:14 - 2:18)
series and then they they have a trailer (2:16 - 2:21)
they also posted a character like (2:18 - 2:23)
screenshots (2:21 - 2:26)
uh also they didn't change the names uh (2:23 - 2:28)
the names are staying the same uh which (2:26 - 2:30)
I think we all thought the names were (2:28 - 2:31)
going to change but (2:30 - 2:35)
I'm into it yeah yeah sure uh in Pokemon (2:31 - 2:37)
Horizons the series dual protagonist (2:35 - 2:42)
liko whose partner is sprigatito and Roy (2:37 - 2:44)
which they don't say what his partner is (2:42 - 2:46)
but I think it's foikoko according to (2:44 - 2:51)
the trailer yeah it looks like it but (2:46 - 2:53)
maybe it's that thing where like it (2:51 - 2:56)
takes eight episodes for free Coco to (2:53 - 2:59)
become said partner uh Roy will (2:56 - 3:01)
encounter many characters during their (2:59 - 3:04)
Journey including uh a group led by (3:01 - 3:06)
Freddy and Captain Pikachu that's what (3:04 - 3:08)
we're saying Freddy right first is that (3:06 - 3:10)
what we're saying I don't I don't know (3:08 - 3:12)
how to say it (3:10 - 3:15)
I was pronouncing it freed in my head (3:12 - 3:21)
three two freed I guess that makes sense (3:15 - 3:21)
why is there yeah the eye should be (3:24 - 3:32)
after the D and free is a word (3:28 - 3:34)
um (3:32 - 3:34)
I mean it is spelled f-r-i-e-d-e (3:35 - 3:40)
3D (3:40 - 3:43)
I'm gonna go with freed it's German is (3:44 - 3:50)
the problem and I don't know my German (3:48 - 3:52)
pronunciation well enough too (3:50 - 3:55)
uh well they're called the rising Vault (3:52 - 3:58)
tacklers that's their group they're (3:55 - 4:00)
traveling across the Pokemon world in an (3:58 - 4:03)
Airship the rising Vault tacklers also (4:00 - 4:06)

partner Pokemon Metagross (4:08 - 4:13)
Murdoch who is skilled at cooking and (4:11 - 4:15)
his partner Pokemon rockruff and then (4:13 - 4:17)

treatments and their partner Pokemon is (4:19 - 4:23)
Chansey (4:21 - 4:28)
um and Ludlow Lico and Roy well who is (4:23 - 4:29)
this other person they're just (4:28 - 4:32)
interested there's this old Fisher (4:29 - 4:40)
person uh we'll come across uh um emefio (4:32 - 4:40)
who is joined by their partner Pokemon (4:40 - 4:45)
cyrul Edge uh and belongs to an (4:42 - 4:47)
organization called the Explorers as (4:45 - 4:51)
well as a popular video stream streamer (4:47 - 4:53)
known as Neato thing that's pretty (4:51 - 4:56)
that's a pretty good name (4:53 - 4:59)
I'm into that (4:56 - 5:01)
Pokemon Horizons the series is set to be (4:59 - 5:03)
a thrilling Journey that explores the (5:01 - 5:04)
Wonders and makes fascinating (5:03 - 5:06)
discoveries across the Pokemon world (5:04 - 5:08)
that's what the vice president of (5:06 - 5:09)
marketing at Pokemon company (5:08 - 5:11)
International said (5:09 - 5:14)
uh the latest series will also shed (5:11 - 5:15)
further light on the mysterious (5:14 - 5:17)
Adventures that await liko and Roy as uh (5:15 - 5:19)
we invite trainers to join the (5:17 - 5:22)
unraveling these secrets when the series (5:19 - 5:24)
premieres outside of Japan later this (5:22 - 5:27)
year (5:24 - 5:27)
and then there was a trailer and then um (5:29 - 5:36)
I think this starts next month in Japan (5:32 - 5:38)
yeah I think it starts next month are we (5:36 - 5:41)
assuming this is going to Netflix (5:38 - 5:44)
yes uh I think so I I think I don't (5:41 - 5:45)
think it's been (5:44 - 5:48)
stated but given that Netflix has the (5:45 - 5:50)
other Pokemon Special stop-motion (5:48 - 5:52)
animation coming up it does seem like (5:50 - 5:54)
Netflix is keeping a hold of all the (5:52 - 5:57)
Pokemon stuff they have that um (5:54 - 6:00)
gosh I watched it the other day watch (5:57 - 6:03)
watching it wasn't putting Asterix there (6:00 - 6:06)
the other day the Arceus adventure thing (6:03 - 6:10)
oh yeah yeah Taco okay so that was that (6:06 - 6:12)
should have been just the movie they (6:10 - 6:15)
just broke it in there pretty much yeah (6:12 - 6:19)
um talk about boring yeah holy cow yeah (6:15 - 6:21)
it's pretty it's pretty dull (6:19 - 6:23)
and I I remember they wanted uh because (6:21 - 6:27)
they they premiered it in in London (6:23 - 6:29)
and they're like this big Premiere at (6:27 - 6:32)
Worlds and a bunch of people were like (6:29 - 6:34)
hey are you seeing the movie tonight or (6:32 - 6:36)
like we're sitting together and I was (6:34 - 6:38)
like I didn't pay fourteen hundred (6:36 - 6:41)
dollars to fly to London to sit in the (6:38 - 6:44)
hot sun with the sunset in my face (6:41 - 6:47)
watching a movie outside no that is that (6:44 - 6:49)
is going to be on Netflix in like two (6:47 - 6:54)
months I'm so glad I did not (6:49 - 6:54)
I don't even remember (6:56 - 7:03)
what it was about I remember Cynthia's (7:00 - 7:06)
like hey we have ruins I remember (7:03 - 7:09)
is this the second time we see Brock's (7:06 - 7:11)
rocket ship or is this the first time we (7:09 - 7:12)
saw Brock's rocket ship I cannot (7:11 - 7:14)
remember (7:12 - 7:18)
Oh you mean his like rocket cars like (7:14 - 7:20)
yeah yeah it's yeah it's it's in here (7:18 - 7:21)
yeah I think this is the first time (7:20 - 7:23)
where I went (7:21 - 7:26)
why does I think when did Brock become a (7:23 - 7:29)
doctor and when did he get a rocket ship (7:26 - 7:32)
makes sense though you could miss like (7:29 - 7:34)
300 episodes and when he came back and (7:32 - 7:35)
he was like oh I'm a doctor now I was (7:34 - 7:36)
like oh that makes sense and then he was (7:35 - 7:38)
like oh my happy and he evolved in (7:36 - 7:40)
Blissey I was like oh that's tight I (7:38 - 7:42)
don't remember anything else oh I have a (7:40 - 7:44)
rocket ship what (7:42 - 7:46)
oh Cynthia has Rose rate yeah we know (7:44 - 7:49)
we've played the games (7:46 - 7:51)
I think I think Brock's rocket ship made (7:49 - 7:54)
the biggest impact yeah (7:51 - 7:56)
I remember that part I remember (7:54 - 7:59)
something about (7:56 - 7:59)
them dressing like olden times for (7:59 - 8:05)
reasons oh yeah that lasted like five (8:02 - 8:07)
minutes that was yeah I don't remember I (8:05 - 8:08)
was like hey remember there's this (8:07 - 8:10)
Legends Arceus game and they dress like (8:08 - 8:11)
this (8:10 - 8:14)
I I I don't know why I thought from like (8:11 - 8:17)
the trailer that there was some time (8:14 - 8:19)
travel Shenanigans right or they were (8:17 - 8:21)
gonna wear that outfit for I don't know (8:19 - 8:23)
maybe at least half the movie they had (8:21 - 8:25)
that I was like oh we're done with the (8:23 - 8:27)
other we're done we're done and they (8:25 - 8:29)
they didn't even catch new Pokemon they (8:27 - 8:33)
fake caught the starters for no just (8:29 - 8:35)
like hey go play this game you know hey (8:33 - 8:36)
you Pokemon traders that have literally (8:35 - 8:39)
catching Pokemon for 25 years now let's (8:36 - 8:41)
have you go through a sequence where you (8:39 - 8:44)
do the thing that you have done for 25 (8:41 - 8:46)
years now (8:44 - 8:50)
um it's really hard to (8:46 - 8:53)
uh talk about the ending to the series (8:50 - 8:56)
that happened uh I think we were all (8:53 - 8:59)
wrong and saying that they they wouldn't (8:56 - 9:01)
get rid of Ash (8:59 - 9:02)
um so (9:01 - 9:05)
spoiler I guess if you don't want some (9:02 - 9:07)
story beats that have happened even (9:05 - 9:08)
though they've been all over the (9:07 - 9:09)
Internet it was like really hard to (9:08 - 9:10)
avoid because everyone was talking about (9:09 - 9:13)
Ash living so just minor spoilers if you (9:10 - 9:15)
want to wait another six months to then (9:13 - 9:17)
watch Ash leave (9:15 - 9:20)
he left like two days ago (9:17 - 9:21)
but (9:20 - 9:23)
um (9:21 - 9:25)
I I'm still shocked that they're like (9:23 - 9:29)
okay Ash is done but I after seeing (9:25 - 9:33)
screenshots and how open-ended they left (9:29 - 9:36)
that last episode (9:33 - 9:40)
I don't think he's done at all anymore (9:36 - 9:43)
they can't be done like (9:40 - 9:45)
whether or not he's going to make (9:43 - 9:47)
appearances or they're gonna do smaller (9:45 - 9:50)
shorts like they need to keep the IP (9:47 - 9:51)
they need to keep the character in their (9:50 - 9:53)
control they need to keep the copyright (9:51 - 9:56)
and for 25 years this has been the face (9:53 - 9:58)
of your anime like (9:56 - 10:01)
it's like saying they haven't done a new (9:58 - 10:03)
Cinderella movie (10:01 - 10:06)
in the last 20 years but Disney's done (10:03 - 10:08)
with Cinderella no no no that no they're (10:06 - 10:10)
not they're not they're never done (10:08 - 10:13)
they're never going to be done it will (10:10 - 10:16)
because they will never end they're not (10:13 - 10:18)
letting that go with their grubby little (10:16 - 10:21)
hands (10:18 - 10:21)
I I don't want to do any stretching the (10:21 - 10:26)
internet does enough stretching to make (10:23 - 10:29)
my own back hurt uh but I I think I do (10:26 - 10:33)
agree with Joe Mr Joe Serebii over at (10:29 - 10:37)
sarahb.net uh he's also he he did a (10:33 - 10:39)
tweet that was like I don't know if I (10:37 - 10:41)
should secretly number the new episodes (10:39 - 10:44)
as a continuation of the current anime (10:41 - 10:47)
because he also thinks that like (10:44 - 10:49)
what if this liko and Roy thing is only (10:47 - 10:52)
a year or so and then we go back to Ash (10:49 - 10:55)
they like left it hmm so open (10:52 - 10:58)
and again I don't want to do too much (10:55 - 11:01)
stretching but like (10:58 - 11:01)
Ash rejoining with Pidgeot (11:01 - 11:08)
I feel like is also (11:05 - 11:12)
like us rejoining with Ash later (11:08 - 11:14)
like that that interaction between him (11:12 - 11:16)
and Pidgeot of like oh it's been so long (11:14 - 11:18)
but we're gonna pick up where we left (11:16 - 11:20)
off (11:18 - 11:23)
is also like a signifier to us of like (11:20 - 11:24)
oh you know if Ash goes away we can just (11:23 - 11:26)
pick up where we left off (11:24 - 11:29)
I mean because they could it's the the (11:26 - 11:32)
problem that they have doing it too soon (11:29 - 11:33)
and like I don't think would happen with (11:32 - 11:37)
the year or not is that you like there's (11:33 - 11:39)
already a problem of media and media of (11:37 - 11:42)
with the generations like caring about (11:39 - 11:44)
characters because things are so (11:42 - 11:46)
short-lived right now so (11:44 - 11:48)
there's a sense of like emotional (11:46 - 11:50)
betrayal when you say goodbye to (11:48 - 11:52)
something and then a year later like (11:50 - 11:54)
that quickly it comes back it generally (11:52 - 11:57)
just angers people like what you did (11:54 - 12:00)
before is meaningless like people do it (11:57 - 12:02)
now with things they saw as a child that (12:00 - 12:05)
was 30 years ago like how dare you step (12:02 - 12:07)
on my childhood like we did it's been 30 (12:05 - 12:11)
years but like I I don't think (12:07 - 12:14)
I don't think it's going to be like and (12:11 - 12:15)
then a year later here comes another (12:14 - 12:17)
series with Ash I have a feeling they (12:15 - 12:19)
may do special episodes with Ash and Ash (12:17 - 12:21)
will appear as a force but I don't think (12:19 - 12:24)
we would see another major series with (12:21 - 12:25)
Ash for at least five to ten years (12:24 - 12:28)
that's generally the generational (12:25 - 12:31)
cycle that happens like 10 years they'll (12:28 - 12:33)
bring something back for a new (12:31 - 12:35)
generation that parents are attached to (12:33 - 12:36)
because parents like oh I love this as a (12:35 - 12:38)
kid and I'm gonna make my kid watch it (12:36 - 12:41)
and then their kid gets attached to it (12:38 - 12:43)
and then they grow up in that weird you (12:41 - 12:45)
know High School age when nobody cares (12:43 - 12:47)
and then another 10 years past they have (12:45 - 12:49)
kids and then they do the same cycle (12:47 - 12:50)
again (12:49 - 12:53)
it is starting to seem I think that some (12:50 - 12:54)
people have picked up on words that make (12:53 - 12:56)
it seem like liko and Roy are only going (12:54 - 12:59)
to be around for paldea and maybe not (12:56 - 13:01)
beyond that so I'm not sure what comes (12:59 - 13:03)
after that I am okay if they're only (13:01 - 13:05)
around for paldea but I kind of don't (13:03 - 13:07)
want Ash in there I kind of want this to (13:05 - 13:09)
be a whole new story I'm kind of excited (13:07 - 13:12)
for that well Ash will be an adult and (13:09 - 13:15)
then both will be his children from (13:12 - 13:17)
different people and uh wait who is Ash (13:15 - 13:18)
supposed to be dating what does the (13:17 - 13:21)
internet want Serena right not no not (13:18 - 13:24)
Serena you ever did you have Serena (13:21 - 13:27)
fashion obsessed and you have a literal (13:24 - 13:29)
legendary Pokemon and Bianca the choice (13:27 - 13:31)
is obvious (13:29 - 13:32)
uh (13:31 - 13:35)
before we move on from this I I think (13:32 - 13:38)
I've said this before it's just like (13:35 - 13:42)
it's really hard to (13:38 - 13:45)
be this is maybe no one's fault it's (13:42 - 13:47)
really hard to be excited for a new (13:45 - 13:49)
anime and then to like be a bit bummed (13:47 - 13:51)
that Ash is leaving when we don't even (13:49 - 13:55)
have half the episode yeah (13:51 - 13:57)
like it (13:55 - 14:00)
it's so hard to avoid (13:57 - 14:02)
the last like what the 12 bonus episodes (14:00 - 14:04)
they did of like Ash's farewell tour (14:02 - 14:05)
yeah (14:04 - 14:07)
because they're just everywhere they're (14:05 - 14:09)
all on the internet like sites are (14:07 - 14:12)
covering them like IGN or Nintendo Super (14:09 - 14:15)
like like everyone's covering it and (14:12 - 14:17)
rightfully so it's a big deal but it's (14:15 - 14:19)
also like (14:17 - 14:22)
it's not here yeah yeah I can't watch it (14:19 - 14:24)
and then like when I do watch it in what (14:22 - 14:26)
five months (14:24 - 14:28)
like I'm it will still be fine like I'm (14:26 - 14:30)
still excited to watch it it's just it's (14:28 - 14:31)
there's just like this weird disconnect (14:30 - 14:34)
it's just frustrating with as many anime (14:31 - 14:36)
that are simulcast (14:34 - 14:40)
that generally take you know a few days (14:36 - 14:43)
to a week at most to come up with a good (14:40 - 14:46)
translation for subtitles that they (14:43 - 14:50)
aren't doing it for this like and we (14:46 - 14:51)
can't even say that Netflix does because (14:50 - 14:53)
Netflix has (14:51 - 14:55)
multiple languages and multiple (14:53 - 14:57)
subtitles and multiple animes like (14:55 - 15:00)
Netflix has the capability of doing it (14:57 - 15:02)
it's just it's it's frustrating and (15:00 - 15:05)
weird to me that for such a huge (15:02 - 15:09)
linchpin of the Pokemon franchise they (15:05 - 15:12)
are still fine with a six month to a (15:09 - 15:15)
year delay to get English voice dubbing (15:12 - 15:17)
despite the fact that all their social (15:15 - 15:20)
media is trying to Hype up The Happening (15:17 - 15:22)
as it's happening in Japan when you (15:20 - 15:23)
still can't watch it here yeah it's such (15:22 - 15:27)
a it's just it it bothers me what's (15:23 - 15:30)
what's uh what's the delay here of like (15:27 - 15:34)
Sarah Sarah natachini the voice of Ash (15:30 - 15:36)
feels like (15:34 - 15:39)
she'll record at any time yeah and for (15:36 - 15:43)
like a huge ending to a series (15:39 - 15:46)
if you're going to like line it like put (15:43 - 15:49)
the effort in to like line this all up (15:46 - 15:54)
like if she's no longer going to be Ash (15:49 - 15:57)
because there is no Ash for in the wink (15:54 - 16:00)
wink there's no Ash uh (15:57 - 16:03)
why not put extra effort into being like (16:00 - 16:06)
okay let's try to wrap up this series so (16:03 - 16:08)
everyone gets it at the same time like (16:06 - 16:10)
why are we why are we why is Americans (16:08 - 16:13)
sorry to sound selfish but also why is (16:10 - 16:14)
the rest of the world besides Japan (16:13 - 16:19)
having to wait when social media is like (16:14 - 16:21)
ash is leaving here's a big deal you'll (16:19 - 16:24)
be able to experience it later this year (16:21 - 16:28)
what yeah I I don't (16:24 - 16:31)
I understood it (16:28 - 16:34)
when it started right like we just (16:31 - 16:36)
didn't have simulacast in the 90s that (16:34 - 16:38)
just wasn't a thing and it was hard to (16:36 - 16:39)
get anime and there were a whole bunch (16:38 - 16:41)
of restrictions and a lot of that is (16:39 - 16:45)
gone I don't understand especially (16:41 - 16:48)
how long sometimes they take between (16:45 - 16:50)
putting the series on Netflix like when (16:48 - 16:53)
the old one ends and the new one comes (16:50 - 16:57)
like there's months sometimes between (16:53 - 17:00)
those where it's like just (16:57 - 17:03)
but I guarantee you the actors will (17:00 - 17:05)
record I guarantee you the problem is (17:03 - 17:08)
not the actors I mean it may be that (17:05 - 17:10)
they don't have a localization team that (17:08 - 17:12)
does the scripts very fast but like even (17:10 - 17:14)
that's (17:12 - 17:17)
strange like I I can't come up with this (17:14 - 17:20)
which with my knowledge of how generally (17:17 - 17:23)
the industry Works a good reason at this (17:20 - 17:27)
point why there's a six-month delay are (17:23 - 17:30)
the people who produce because like I (17:27 - 17:31)
don't think it's a voice actor thing are (17:30 - 17:33)
the people who produce the show working (17:31 - 17:37)
on other shows I don't Pro I mean if (17:33 - 17:38)
you're a producer you're not doing that (17:37 - 17:40)
much you're having meetings (17:38 - 17:42)
I mean you're not doing like producers (17:40 - 17:45)
don't do the actual work like they (17:42 - 17:47)
aren't in The Voice studios I mean they (17:45 - 17:48)
are sometimes overseeing things but (17:47 - 17:50)
generally the directors are the people (17:48 - 17:53)
that are directing the voice actors who (17:50 - 17:55)
are in the recording and the animation (17:53 - 17:58)
has already been done right the the hard (17:55 - 18:00)
part is like oh the animation the (17:58 - 18:02)
animation's done and the script has been (18:00 - 18:04)
written it just needs to be translated (18:02 - 18:08)
so I I I I cannot (18:04 - 18:08)
understand with as many other series (18:08 - 18:14)
that are simulcast (18:11 - 18:17)
and there are other series that do dubs (18:14 - 18:19)
a lot faster like they can get those (18:17 - 18:22)
dubs done in a month like why we have (18:19 - 18:25)
such a huge delay I just I cannot fathom (18:22 - 18:27)
the decision that's gone into not trying (18:25 - 18:30)
to push it forward do we here know if (18:27 - 18:33)
all of the different language dubs come (18:30 - 18:35)
out at the same time is that what (18:33 - 18:36)
they're aiming for (18:35 - 18:39)
they can but most other anime series (18:36 - 18:42)
don't right like the English will come (18:39 - 18:44)
first and then a month later the other (18:42 - 18:46)
languages will come (18:44 - 18:48)
because there's translations things but (18:46 - 18:53)
again those tend to be slightly smaller (18:48 - 18:56)
Animation Studios that have timing (18:53 - 18:58)
issues other ones can do the whole thing (18:56 - 19:01)
pretty quickly if they're huge they just (18:58 - 19:03)
don't seem to prioritize it here and I (19:01 - 19:05)
don't (19:03 - 19:05)
uh well speaking of things that come out (19:07 - 19:11)
later uh (19:09 - 19:12)
uh the new Pokemon trading card game (19:11 - 19:15)
expansion for scarlet and violet paldea (19:12 - 19:19)
evolved is coming on June 9th uh this (19:15 - 19:20)

paldea evolved well also this week is (19:26 - 19:33)

people sell them early they're like the (19:56 - 20:01)
official release date is like end of the (19:58 - 20:03)
month but yeah yeah I'm sure you could (20:01 - 20:06)
find them uh paldea evolved will (20:03 - 20:09)
introduce more Pokemon EX which sport (20:06 - 20:11)
High HP as well as powerful attacks and (20:09 - 20:13)
abilities but they give up two prize (20:11 - 20:15)
cards when knocked out trainers will (20:13 - 20:17)
continue to see Terra Pokemon EX in the (20:15 - 20:19)
new expansion including Slowking (20:17 - 20:22)
Fortress and Dedenne displayed in Full (20:19 - 20:24)
Art illustrations to capture the unique (20:22 - 20:27)
Crystal effects of uh the characters (20:24 - 20:29)
alternate art styles will be introduced (20:27 - 20:31)
for illustrations rare and special rare (20:29 - 20:33)
cards allowing for trainers to collect (20:31 - 20:35)
unique cards that Spotlight Pokemon's (20:33 - 20:38)
personality traits or Evolutions there (20:35 - 20:41)
will be 15 Pokemon EX 3 Tera Pokemon EX (20:38 - 20:45)
36 illustration rare 18 ultra rare (20:41 - 20:48)
Pokemon EX and eight ultra rare (20:45 - 20:52)

hyper rare gold etch cards which can (20:55 - 21:03)
include Pokemon EX trainer and energy (20:59 - 21:03)
so we have rare (21:04 - 21:11)
ultra rare special illustration rare and (21:07 - 21:14)
Hyper rare (21:11 - 21:15)
yep (21:14 - 21:18)
no rainbow rare though rainbow rare is (21:15 - 21:20)
gone (21:18 - 21:22)
rainbow rare gone (21:20 - 21:24)
rainbow wear was always like either (21:22 - 21:26)
people loved him or hated them I think (21:24 - 21:29)
for the most part people like (21:26 - 21:32)
the gold rare (21:29 - 21:32)
and people like illustration rare (21:33 - 21:36)
because they're like full art the (21:34 - 21:37)
illustration rows are just amazing (21:36 - 21:39)
illustration rares (21:37 - 21:41)
so these are different these are always (21:39 - 21:44)
slightly different sets than what (21:41 - 21:45)
happened in Japan right like they're (21:44 - 21:48)
weird combinations yeah because Japan (21:45 - 21:52)
does uh they do like uh maybe 70 to 90 (21:48 - 21:55)
card set about once a month give or take (21:52 - 21:58)
maybe five weeks if they're you know (21:55 - 22:00)
running behind on something but yeah (21:58 - 22:05)
triple beat merges a couple together (22:00 - 22:07)
um also Japan will do like this is (22:05 - 22:09)
Scarlet set this is violet set so then (22:07 - 22:12)
they slap those together and then got it (22:09 - 22:15)
and this paldea evolved set (22:12 - 22:17)
if I'm following it right this will be (22:15 - 22:19)
the first set of paldea Pokemon that (22:17 - 22:22)
will be in stores and stuff no this is (22:19 - 22:24)
the second set oh okay I thought the (22:22 - 22:25)
first one wasn't available in like (22:24 - 22:26)
Target (22:25 - 22:29)
the first set is just scarlet and violet (22:26 - 22:30)
and that will be available in Target (22:29 - 22:35)
okay I think on Thursday technically (22:30 - 22:36)
uh (22:35 - 22:40)
uh no 31st Friday (22:36 - 22:40)
so cards this weekend first paleo cards (22:40 - 22:46)
this weekend and then second set June (22:44 - 22:49)
9th and then that would be July August (22:46 - 22:51)
September then we would get the next set (22:49 - 22:54)
end of September (22:51 - 22:56)
early October (22:54 - 22:59)
every three months (22:56 - 22:59)
so (22:59 - 23:03)
and the art just keeps getting better (23:01 - 23:06)
yeah that's that's the one thing I have (23:03 - 23:07)
to say about the cards the art just (23:06 - 23:09)
keeps getting better (23:07 - 23:12)
very very very true good art and (23:09 - 23:15)
somebody made a commander like (23:12 - 23:18)
uh version of the Pokemon TCG card game (23:15 - 23:20)
called the gym leader Challenge and I'm (23:18 - 23:23)
sort of into this (23:20 - 23:23)
that sounds fun yeah I haven't read a (23:23 - 23:27)
lot about it or how it works but like (23:25 - 23:29)
I've read enough to be like oh okay it (23:27 - 23:31)
is it is basically based off of (23:29 - 23:34)
magic Commander (23:31 - 23:36)
because you have to have monotype like (23:34 - 23:38)
you are a gym leader of a monotype and (23:36 - 23:40)
then again it has Singleton rules so you (23:38 - 23:42)
have to have a one copy of the card in (23:40 - 23:44)
there I don't know how well it works but (23:42 - 23:47)
I've seen people talking about it and (23:44 - 23:50)
that excites me (23:47 - 23:50)
uh yeah palday evolved is on pre-order (23:51 - 23:55)
from (23:54 - 23:57)
Pokemon Center (23:55 - 24:00)
uh they they they're still doing their (23:57 - 24:01)
like (24:00 - 24:02)
Pokemon Center (24:01 - 24:06)
ETB which I think it's like maybe the (24:02 - 24:07)
only thing you should get from Pokemon (24:06 - 24:09)
Center you should probably not get an (24:07 - 24:11)
entire booster box from Pokemon Center (24:09 - 24:14)
because you're paying (24:11 - 24:16)
too much money for a booster box from (24:14 - 24:19)
Pokemon Center it's 161 on Pokemon (24:16 - 24:21)
Center usually you can go to (24:19 - 24:23)
like a cool stuff Inc or a Troll and (24:21 - 24:27)
Toad for like 120. the reason and the (24:23 - 24:28)
reason it's cheaper there is because (24:27 - 24:30)
they order (24:28 - 24:32)
so many (24:30 - 24:34)
that they're still making a profit (24:32 - 24:36)
versus well like on Pokemon Center (24:34 - 24:37)
you're literally just paying four (24:36 - 24:40)
dollars a pack it's just four times 32 (24:37 - 24:42)
or whatever like they're not giving you (24:40 - 24:44)
any discount (24:42 - 24:48)
uh the ETV is okay there's also a Cyrus (24:44 - 24:49)
premium collection and a Clara premium (24:48 - 24:51)
collection on Pokemon Center and those (24:49 - 24:52)
those are like really cool and they're (24:51 - 24:53)
pretty worth it (24:52 - 24:55)
and I almost pulled the trigger on those (24:53 - 24:56)
but then I'm like (24:55 - 24:58)
oh they have the yellow border and we're (24:56 - 25:01)
switching to Silver border and maybe (24:58 - 25:02)
what if I just bought those cards (25:01 - 25:06)
separately just like it comes with like (25:02 - 25:07)
four of each but I'm like I just need (25:06 - 25:10)
one for the collection I'm not gonna (25:07 - 25:12)
play these (25:10 - 25:12)
all right uh let's take a break and then (25:14 - 25:19)
when we come back we got a bunch of (25:17 - 25:22)
scarlet and violet I still want to say (25:19 - 25:24)
sword and shield we got a bunch of (25:22 - 25:28)
scarlet and uh Violet related news so we (25:24 - 25:30)
will be right back (25:28 - 25:35)
and we are back uh so they uh from a (25:30 - 25:39)
break thank you yeah (25:35 - 25:39)
so much on that one in in scarlet and (25:42 - 25:47)
violet they repeated decidueye although (25:45 - 25:49)
this is the first time they they didn't (25:47 - 25:51)
put a week in between (25:49 - 25:53)
um it was decidueye and then decidue so (25:51 - 25:54)
I don't know if that's the new plan (25:53 - 25:56)
going forward (25:54 - 25:58)
um who knows uh the second week is never (25:56 - 26:01)
never as popular as the first week and (25:58 - 26:03)
uh when randoms are real wild (26:01 - 26:06)
oh yeah yeah although I did at one point (26:03 - 26:10)
I switch I put tot on my maridon to (26:06 - 26:11)
taunt at the beginning so it couldn't (26:10 - 26:13)
sword stance because I was seeing how (26:11 - 26:15)
people would be like full-blown attack (26:13 - 26:17)
it would throw it Shield up like at the (26:15 - 26:18)
second turn and I'm like let's just do (26:17 - 26:20)
this let's just help a bunch of these (26:18 - 26:23)
poor people so yeah it doesn't have time (26:20 - 26:24)
if they didn't have time to build a (26:23 - 26:26)
Pokemon for the first round why would (26:24 - 26:27)
they have time to build a Pokemon (26:26 - 26:31)
they didn't the time the taunt Strat (26:27 - 26:34)
worked for a lot of randos we we got (26:31 - 26:35)
through it without a problem although (26:34 - 26:36)
boy (26:35 - 26:39)
people make some Oh you mean you're (26:36 - 26:42)
taunting to prevent feather dance (26:39 - 26:42)
you got it right right right yeah yeah (26:43 - 26:46)
because feather dance doesn't matter if (26:44 - 26:49)
they're bringing Morita yeah yeah but (26:46 - 26:51)
the sword stance that happens like right (26:49 - 26:53)
after it puts up his shield stops that (26:51 - 26:56)
from happening yeah I was like so let's (26:53 - 26:58)
get it (26:56 - 27:00)
instead of (26:58 - 27:03)
so every raid (27:00 - 27:05)
big Raid event they would do like two (27:03 - 27:08)
promoted Pokemon for example with (27:05 - 27:09)
Greninja I think they promoted like (27:08 - 27:12)
bronzong and maybe Gengar or something I (27:09 - 27:15)
don't remember exactly what it was but (27:12 - 27:18)
you know in case with Charizard I think (27:15 - 27:22)
it was mimiki mimikyu and forges (27:18 - 27:24)
um ideally it was like maybe again (27:22 - 27:26)
florges were one of them I think it was (27:24 - 27:27)
for Charizard because Charizard was (27:26 - 27:30)
Dragon yeah yeah so the concept there (27:27 - 27:33)
was if you didn't have a Pokemon you (27:30 - 27:35)
could do a raid for if you'd have a (27:33 - 27:37)
Pokemon to counter Charizard or whatever (27:35 - 27:40)
you could do one of these promoted ones (27:37 - 27:43)
like floor just and it would be level 75 (27:40 - 27:45)
and you would get some candies and (27:43 - 27:46)
ideally hopefully you would level it up (27:45 - 27:48)
to 100 and you have a pretty decent raid (27:46 - 27:50)
counter against Charizard like floor (27:48 - 27:51)
just was actually not a bad pick for (27:50 - 27:54)
Charizard at all maybe brongzong not the (27:51 - 27:57)
best but you know for Greninja take away (27:54 - 28:00)
take it for what it's worth uh (27:57 - 28:03)
and for decidui they didn't do that at (28:00 - 28:05)
all which on one thing you could be like (28:03 - 28:09)
maybe no one was doing these (28:05 - 28:12)
that's probably it yeah (28:09 - 28:15)
um but this weekend or this past weekend (28:12 - 28:17)
it's over now is when you're listening (28:15 - 28:20)
to it they did Blissey and Tarot raids (28:17 - 28:22)
so that they had a repeat of decidueye (28:20 - 28:24)
but then they added a brand new Raid (28:22 - 28:28)
event for Blissey and then blissy you (28:24 - 28:29)
would get (28:28 - 28:31)
um delightful rewards their words not (28:29 - 28:34)
mine such as XP candies and various (28:31 - 28:37)
tarot shards lucky trainers might even (28:34 - 28:38)
encounter a Blissey that grants a load (28:37 - 28:40)
of additional tarot shards with (28:38 - 28:42)
different Terror types in which you can (28:40 - 28:44)
use to change your Pokemon's Terror type (28:42 - 28:46)
at the treasure Eatery in midali for 50 (28:44 - 28:48)
shards (28:46 - 28:51)
and uh (28:48 - 28:54)
that this might be the best rated event (28:51 - 28:57)
they have ever done it was (28:54 - 28:59)
so (28:57 - 29:02)
many shots yeah it was the rewards were (28:59 - 29:04)
a lot but (29:02 - 29:06)
the rate itself was kind of boring oh (29:04 - 29:09)
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah but you only do (29:06 - 29:10)
those kind of things for the rewards (29:09 - 29:11)
yeah (29:10 - 29:13)
I mean I I spent a night doing them what (29:11 - 29:15)
was it Friday night I did it I did like (29:13 - 29:18)
a bunch and I was like I yeah good time (29:15 - 29:21)
this is fine I've been too busy moving I (29:18 - 29:23)
really wanted to do them and I missed (29:21 - 29:26)
the entire thing (29:23 - 29:28)
yeah they they they pumped out the (29:26 - 29:31)
shards which (29:28 - 29:31)
um I guess the one thing that I haven't (29:31 - 29:36)
like pumped out is urban mystica yeah (29:33 - 29:38)
but (29:36 - 29:41)
I don't see them doing that anytime soon (29:38 - 29:44)
I no I don't either until the DLC when (29:41 - 29:46)
it's like we had nothing else to bring (29:44 - 29:47)
you people back (29:46 - 29:51)
it's it's weird in in this game where (29:47 - 29:54)
like a (29:51 - 29:57)
you can almost I I will say almost very (29:54 - 30:00)
Loosely you could almost guarantee a (29:57 - 30:03)
shiny within 30 minutes of using proper (30:00 - 30:05)
Urban mystica (30:03 - 30:08)
and (30:05 - 30:10)
I I know Greg's stance of like make (30:08 - 30:13)
Chinese easier 100 like (30:10 - 30:16)
I'm not disagreeing with it I think (30:13 - 30:19)
getting one shiny in 30 minutes or maybe (30:16 - 30:20)
multiple (30:19 - 30:22)
is pretty good I think it's really great (30:20 - 30:25)
and at least every time I've used an (30:22 - 30:26)
urban mystica (30:25 - 30:28)
and I (30:26 - 30:31)
won I I feel the the suspense of like oh (30:28 - 30:33)
I'm on a 30 minute timer uh and I don't (30:31 - 30:36)
like stuff like that like I hated uh I (30:33 - 30:38)
as much as I like Majora's Mask I hated (30:36 - 30:40)
marjora's mask because there was always (30:38 - 30:42)
like a clock running uh what was that (30:40 - 30:44)
zombie game it was like the the very (30:42 - 30:48)
first zombie game on Xbox 360. (30:44 - 30:49)
uh (30:48 - 30:52)
Not Dead by daylight (30:49 - 30:54)
but that game had a time or two and I (30:52 - 30:56)
absolutely hated it (30:54 - 30:58)
anyways (30:56 - 31:00)
um I feel like when I use an urban (30:58 - 31:02)
mystica and I'm on a timer and I'm like (31:00 - 31:04)
oh man this feels like forever and then (31:02 - 31:07)
I pull it up and it's like oh I'm I it's (31:04 - 31:10)
only been 10 minutes I guess it hasn't (31:07 - 31:12)
actually been forever it's only been 10 (31:10 - 31:14)
minutes it's just been intense right (31:12 - 31:17)
you've just been into it correct and (31:14 - 31:19)
then I think about Old Chart I like I've (31:17 - 31:21)
shot he hunted in like Leaf Green in (31:19 - 31:24)
Pokemon Crystal Ultra Sun Moon Omega (31:21 - 31:27)
Ruby Alpha Sapphire X and Y black I got (31:24 - 31:29)
hunted in every Pokemon game out there (31:27 - 31:31)
like (31:29 - 31:35)
if you got a shiny in like four hours in (31:31 - 31:37)
Ultra Sun Ultra Moon that was considered (31:35 - 31:41)
like Fast lucky like you you like wow (31:37 - 31:43)
like like if I did a stream and I (31:41 - 31:45)
streamed six hours and I got two shinies (31:43 - 31:47)
through SOS and sudden Moon my twitch (31:45 - 31:48)
chat would be like why are you so lucky (31:47 - 31:52)
yeah like how how did you get two in six (31:48 - 31:54)
hours and now we're at a point where (31:52 - 31:56)
it's like (31:54 - 31:58)
you're getting almost one every 30 (31:56 - 32:02)
minutes which I think is I think is fine (31:58 - 32:06)
because the thing to get that is a (32:02 - 32:07)
little bit hard I'm doing air quotes for (32:06 - 32:09)
the audio a little bit harder to get (32:07 - 32:13)
like Urban mystica is not that hard to (32:09 - 32:15)
get and also I think getting Urban (32:13 - 32:19)
mystica respects your time like you are (32:15 - 32:21)
doing a raid you're not like powering on (32:19 - 32:23)
and off your console you're not like (32:21 - 32:26)
walking in a circle if you're not like (32:23 - 32:27)
walking back and like you're doing (32:26 - 32:29)
you're doing something that involves (32:27 - 32:32)
like a little bit of thinking so I I (32:29 - 32:33)
would assume that most people play games (32:32 - 32:35)
because like (32:33 - 32:37)
you know they make you thinking a little (32:35 - 32:39)
bit right like a shooter you gotta like (32:37 - 32:40)
where's your movement and a Mario game (32:39 - 32:43)
get your jumping racing game how you (32:40 - 32:46)
gonna take that turn you're you're doing (32:43 - 32:48)
a raid and then like five star raids (32:46 - 32:51)
have a a 10 chance to drop an urban (32:48 - 32:53)
mystica six star rates have a 13 chance (32:51 - 32:55)
there's a handful of raids that have a (32:53 - 32:59)
little bit higher like Vaporeon or or (32:55 - 33:00)
um (32:59 - 33:05)
well I'm a foreign gives more Don dozo (33:00 - 33:07)
so I think the (33:05 - 33:10)
I think the balance is there it's just (33:07 - 33:13)
so weird that (33:10 - 33:13)
that you have almost two sides people (33:14 - 33:17)
complaining that shinies are too easy (33:15 - 33:19)
but then also people complaining that (33:17 - 33:22)
Urban mystica is hard to get I don't (33:19 - 33:26)
think either is true yeah it's when you (33:22 - 33:27)
put them together that it starts to make (33:26 - 33:30)
sense it's just that this is the first (33:27 - 33:31)
time in a while where to get shinies (33:30 - 33:34)
you're actively playing the game the (33:31 - 33:35)
whole time (33:34 - 33:37)
right (33:35 - 33:39)
yes I think you're right like when you (33:37 - 33:41)
put them together the time sync makes (33:39 - 33:43)
sense (33:41 - 33:45)
for sure I remember like let's go (33:43 - 33:47)
Pikachu let's go Eevee where you were (33:45 - 33:49)
supposed to get to like a chain of 32 (33:47 - 33:52)
and then people would just stand there (33:49 - 33:54)
and they would be like (33:52 - 33:57)
then they would like complain that shiny (33:54 - 34:00)
hunting was just standing there (33:57 - 34:03)
and then I would say well you could keep (34:00 - 34:05)
catching (34:03 - 34:07)
and Not only would that make the Pokemon (34:05 - 34:09)
easier to catch because there was a (34:07 - 34:11)
threshold in let's go Pikachu let's go (34:09 - 34:13)
Eevee where if you caught like a hundred (34:11 - 34:15)
it would permanently make them easier to (34:13 - 34:19)
catch and I I showed time and time again (34:15 - 34:22)
if you caught a bunch you would then get (34:19 - 34:24)
a bunch of candy and then you could sell (34:22 - 34:25)
that candy so you were like actively (34:24 - 34:27)
making money and I thought the economy (34:25 - 34:29)
in that game was good (34:27 - 34:31)
because it rewards you for playing if (34:29 - 34:35)
you kept doing an action you got a (34:31 - 34:36)
reward and then that reward got you (34:35 - 34:38)
money and then you wouldn't have to like (34:36 - 34:40)
do other things to get the money uh and (34:38 - 34:43)
then we learned three years later that (34:40 - 34:45)
if you just stood there you actually (34:43 - 34:48)
weren't getting better odds the better (34:45 - 34:50)
odds only happened when you caught you (34:48 - 34:52)
kept catching when you were actually (34:50 - 34:55)
playing the game you were yeah they want (34:52 - 34:57)
you to actually play the game so like (34:55 - 34:59)
and let's go Pikachu let's go Evie they (34:57 - 35:02)
wanted you to actually keep playing to (34:59 - 35:04)
get the good shinies and it's like the (35:02 - 35:07)
same thing here where they want you to (35:04 - 35:09)
do raids to get Urban mysticas and then (35:07 - 35:12)
they're rewarding you with like I don't (35:09 - 35:13)
like using the word easy but like I (35:12 - 35:16)
don't know how is it like easy or shiny (35:13 - 35:18)
it's like I don't know quicker shinies I (35:16 - 35:20)
don't know like faster faster shinies (35:18 - 35:22)
like sure you could be unlucky and use (35:20 - 35:23)
urban mystica not getting right that's (35:22 - 35:28)
just RNG but like uh on average (35:23 - 35:28)
comparing this game to like ultrasound (35:28 - 35:33)
on Ultra Moon you know shiny in four (35:30 - 35:36)
hours through SNS is considered fast uh (35:33 - 35:37)
shiny and (35:36 - 35:40)
30 minutes to me I I think is considered (35:37 - 35:42)
fast so (35:40 - 35:44)
um (35:42 - 35:46)
I'm sure they will do an urban mystica (35:44 - 35:49)
event I'm sure yeah I'm sure that will (35:46 - 35:52)
happen but I I think (35:49 - 35:56)
I think they have a good balance of like (35:52 - 35:58)
I don't know I like like I I do think (35:56 - 36:00)
Greg has (35:58 - 36:02)
a good point of like why are we (36:00 - 36:05)
artificially making these rarer because (36:02 - 36:08)
they're still fun to get even on (36:05 - 36:10)
Community Day when they're one in 25 it (36:08 - 36:14)
is still fun to get and I think what (36:10 - 36:15)
they I think the Pokemon company did (36:14 - 36:18)
such a great thing and I I championed (36:15 - 36:21)
this all through sword and shield (36:18 - 36:24)
because another thing you hear is (36:21 - 36:26)
well shinies just aren't rare or special (36:24 - 36:30)
anymore or my my shiny is devalued which (36:26 - 36:32)
is such a weird argument to me because (36:30 - 36:35)
like they don't have value (36:32 - 36:38)
they don't they don't have value even (36:35 - 36:41)
even let's say Greg and I were hunting (36:38 - 36:43)
in Pokemon Crystal together you know oh (36:41 - 36:47)
what each what horror alternate universe (36:43 - 36:49)
is this who this is when I start going (36:47 - 36:52)
on my Multiverse of mad just to find the (36:49 - 36:54)
other person other me that has such (36:52 - 36:57)
horrific taste that we are choosing to (36:54 - 37:01)
play Crystal to shiny hunting (36:57 - 37:04)
you got a little more free time nowadays (37:01 - 37:09)
not no amount of free time will make me (37:04 - 37:13)
stoop that low so okay in in the in the (37:09 - 37:15)
fantasy world that is Greg and I hunting (37:13 - 37:17)
in Pokemon Crystal let's say we both (37:15 - 37:19)
wanted to go for a napkins (37:17 - 37:23)
and I don't know why Atkins and I I get (37:19 - 37:25)
my Atkins in a hundred encounters and (37:23 - 37:29)
Greg gets his Ekans in 16 000 encounters (37:25 - 37:31)
Nine's worth more (37:29 - 37:34)
right that was the like the point I just (37:31 - 37:37)
make more money in theory per hour than (37:34 - 37:40)
you do so my hours build time that I'll (37:37 - 37:42)
be building the Pokemon company for my (37:40 - 37:44)
time to get that will be a much higher (37:42 - 37:47)
Bill than yours times right like like (37:44 - 37:50)
it's so hard to be like well well I put (37:47 - 37:51)
more effort in (37:50 - 37:54)
I I mean you did the same repetitive (37:51 - 37:56)
action over and over it's just RNG was (37:54 - 37:59)
not effort of wandering around doing the (37:56 - 38:02)
same thing no it's like when it's again (37:59 - 38:05)
it's like when CEOs are like I work all (38:02 - 38:07)
the time you had seven meetings (38:05 - 38:10)
I that's nothing you did nothing you did (38:07 - 38:12)
nothing (38:10 - 38:14)
but I think what they did in sword and (38:12 - 38:16)
shield which They carried over here was (38:14 - 38:19)
introduced marks so if you did want (38:16 - 38:22)
something that felt more rare or unique (38:19 - 38:24)
or special (38:22 - 38:24)
um a a marked shiny (38:25 - 38:31)
would theoretically (38:28 - 38:34)
or statistically let me change my word (38:31 - 38:37)
statistically be more rare than like a (38:34 - 38:40)
one in eight thousand shiny because even (38:37 - 38:42)
if you had shiny charm and sword and (38:40 - 38:47)
shield one in 1365 times one in a (38:42 - 38:50)
hundred is (38:47 - 38:52)
mathematically I'm just using a bunch of (38:50 - 38:54)
big they're big words to me because I'm (38:52 - 38:56)
that I have a poor education (38:54 - 38:59)
mathematically more that's more than (38:56 - 39:01)
eight thousand because it would be those (38:59 - 39:05)
two numbers the times each other (39:01 - 39:08)
um and They Carried that over here so uh (39:05 - 39:10)
and they introduced another thing on top (39:08 - 39:12)
of that which is big or small (39:10 - 39:13)
so you could get (39:12 - 39:16)
I want a Big Shiny I want a small shiny (39:13 - 39:18)
I want a rare Mark shiny I want to (39:16 - 39:20)
personally personality Mark shiny I want (39:18 - 39:21)
a (39:20 - 39:25)
Big Shiny with a personality Mark like (39:21 - 39:27)
yeah this is all just more artificial (39:25 - 39:29)
Rarity but if you want something that's (39:27 - 39:31)
really really really artificially rare (39:29 - 39:33)
you have the options to go for yeah and (39:31 - 39:35)
no one's stopping you from doing it and (39:33 - 39:37)
you can still have fun and you can and (39:35 - 39:40)
if you want to flex you know again in (39:37 - 39:41)
the Greg and I situation I could be like (39:40 - 39:43)
well Greg and I well we both got Atkins (39:41 - 39:46)
and and Crystal what is more there was (39:43 - 39:48)
there's no rareness between them besides (39:46 - 39:50)
one took longer than the other whereas I (39:48 - 39:51)
could be like (39:50 - 39:55)
well I spent a week getting go goats and (39:51 - 39:58)
I finally got a big shiny go-goat and (39:55 - 39:59)
you can be proud of that and that's (39:58 - 40:01)
totally I mean you can be proud of your (39:59 - 40:03)
regular Go-Go right yeah you might be (40:01 - 40:04)
your first shiny (40:03 - 40:06)
um but for those people who want (40:04 - 40:09)
something more rare and they're maybe (40:06 - 40:11)
complaining that the Rarity is gone or (40:09 - 40:13)
shinies are too easy (40:11 - 40:17)
the the you can there are harder shinies (40:13 - 40:20)
to get like a big shiny is harder to get (40:17 - 40:22)
than a non-big shiny I I mean I actually (40:20 - 40:25)
think that a lot of these people are (40:22 - 40:30)
struggling with the concept of (40:25 - 40:30)
you value something that doesn't have (40:30 - 40:36)
value and you want other people to Value (40:33 - 40:39)
it as much as you do and people don't (40:36 - 40:42)
the company doesn't like I think they (40:39 - 40:44)
are definitely struggling with this idea (40:42 - 40:48)
that Community Days exist and it's (40:44 - 40:51)
easier and they're struggling to make (40:48 - 40:56)
sense of I spent so much time doing this (40:51 - 40:56)
and they can't comprehend that it's fine (40:56 - 41:03)
for only them to care about it (41:00 - 41:05)
and I think that is (41:03 - 41:09)
there was a culture of because you know (41:05 - 41:11)
that you were a lot younger when it was (41:09 - 41:13)
a lot harder it was like oh you got this (41:11 - 41:14)
thing and it's so rare and that's so (41:13 - 41:16)
exciting and then as you get older and (41:14 - 41:17)
you realize (41:16 - 41:21)
how valuable time is (41:17 - 41:24)
it's harder to look at people who had to (41:21 - 41:26)
spend less time getting the same result (41:24 - 41:31)
and understanding that both are equal (41:26 - 41:31)
you just can't comprehend that you have (41:31 - 41:36)
a different value system and is no (41:34 - 41:38)
longer good enough for you to be proud (41:36 - 41:41)
of what you did you now have to you feel (41:38 - 41:43)
like all of these other people have to (41:41 - 41:46)
be proud of what I did for this to be (41:43 - 41:48)
worth the time that I spent on it it's (41:46 - 41:52)
like find the happiness in yourself (41:48 - 41:55)
like you would be so (41:52 - 41:59)
wildly excited if you walked into a new (41:55 - 42:02)
area and the first thing you found was a (41:59 - 42:04)
shiny (42:02 - 42:04)
people will say well it only took you (42:05 - 42:08)
one (42:07 - 42:09)
you only you found it in one that (42:08 - 42:11)
doesn't count it took you no time to (42:09 - 42:13)
find that like like the the thought (42:11 - 42:14)
process that you're jumping through to (42:13 - 42:17)
try to make other people value the thing (42:14 - 42:19)
that you care about isn't worth the time (42:17 - 42:21)
and they are never going to care as much (42:19 - 42:23)
as you do they just aren't (42:21 - 42:25)
you know what's funny as I was I was (42:23 - 42:27)
doing twitch Rivals this this past week (42:25 - 42:31)
and uh for those that missed it it was (42:27 - 42:34)
uh twitch picked 64 different streamers (42:31 - 42:36)
you know there was pretty well known (42:34 - 42:38)
streamers that that participated like (42:36 - 42:41)
shady penguin was in it Shofu was in it (42:38 - 42:43)
right and the it was a two-day event the (42:41 - 42:45)
first day event was a speed run like try (42:43 - 42:47)
to get through the game as fast as (42:45 - 42:50)
possible you were the the number one (42:47 - 42:52)
qualifier was how many Gym badges you (42:50 - 42:55)
had were Titan badges or team star (42:52 - 42:56)
badges right (42:55 - 42:59)
and then if there was you know if Hannah (42:56 - 43:01)
and I both had hm badges the second (42:59 - 43:02)
qualifier would be like how many unique (43:01 - 43:05)
Pokemon did you catch in between (43:02 - 43:06)
um (43:05 - 43:08)
and you had four hours to do that and (43:06 - 43:11)
then day two was uh battle it was you (43:08 - 43:14)
know we build the team and then try to (43:11 - 43:16)
battle and you had to use fresh save (43:14 - 43:18)
files you couldn't trade you couldn't go (43:16 - 43:20)
online (43:18 - 43:22)
um and I had (43:20 - 43:24)
like three three takeaways from this (43:22 - 43:26)
number one is when I walked out of the (43:24 - 43:29)
like tutorial Zone and I'm like trying (43:26 - 43:30)
to like get my flamigo because like (43:29 - 43:32)
flamigo is like one of the best Pokemon (43:30 - 43:35)
to speed run it with I I ran into a (43:32 - 43:38)
shiny little chunk so like full odds no (43:35 - 43:42)
sandwich like and I I was both like over (43:38 - 43:44)
the moon excited because there's this (43:42 - 43:46)
there's this pink lechonk here but also (43:44 - 43:48)
like (43:46 - 43:48)
and I had like a level like six (43:53 - 43:59)
spigotito and it's a level 18 shiny (43:56 - 44:00)
little chunk and I have like four (43:59 - 44:04)
Pokeballs and I'm like I can't I didn't (44:00 - 44:07)
save because I'm like running as fast as (44:04 - 44:09)
possible to flamigo my only mission was (44:07 - 44:11)
to get to flamigo and avoid everything (44:09 - 44:14)
else and this and I end up catching Le (44:11 - 44:15)
chunk it almost knocked me out (44:14 - 44:17)
I almost failed it which would have (44:15 - 44:18)
probably been worse right because like (44:17 - 44:20)
right Not only would I lose the shiny (44:18 - 44:22)
little chunk I would lose a bunch of (44:20 - 44:24)
time because it would push me back to a (44:22 - 44:28)
Pokemon Center so that was like again (44:24 - 44:31)
like I didn't do anything fancy for (44:28 - 44:34)
shiny Le chunk it was it was I'm sure (44:31 - 44:35)
there's tons of players that they you (44:34 - 44:37)
know they open up scarlet and violet and (44:35 - 44:39)
or any Pokemon game and the first (44:37 - 44:41)
Pokemon they see is shiny it's an (44:39 - 44:44)
amazing feeling it feels so it's it's (44:41 - 44:46)
like on commute day the first Pokemon (44:44 - 44:47)
the first (44:46 - 44:50)
Fennekin you tap on his shiny it feels (44:47 - 44:52)
amazing right it's like wow the first (44:50 - 44:54)
one I tapped on is shiny anyways (44:52 - 44:57)
um shiny little chalk caught what she's (44:54 - 45:00)
an All-Star uh the the second takeaway (44:57 - 45:01)
is (45:00 - 45:04)
that (45:01 - 45:06)
I I feel like sometimes we get so caught (45:04 - 45:09)
up in a new game and we we go through it (45:06 - 45:11)
as fast as possible because it's new and (45:09 - 45:13)
it's exciting playing through scarlet (45:11 - 45:15)
and violet fresh and trying to go (45:13 - 45:17)
through it as fast as possible when (45:15 - 45:18)
other people are trying to go through it (45:17 - 45:20)
as fast as possible (45:18 - 45:21)
it (45:20 - 45:25)
that game is big like there is like in (45:21 - 45:28)
four hours I ended up getting seven Gym (45:25 - 45:32)
badges one team star all five Titans and (45:28 - 45:34)
I did that with just a flamigo and I (45:32 - 45:35)
watched speedrun videos before I did it (45:34 - 45:40)
but I was like you are skipping so much (45:35 - 45:43)
of that game that is not catching any (45:40 - 45:45)
other Pokemon that is not picking up any (45:43 - 45:46)
items you don't need to off the ground (45:45 - 45:49)
that is skipping through all of the (45:46 - 45:52)
dialogue as fast as you can these games (45:49 - 45:56)
are huge and I guess I didn't really (45:52 - 45:57)
like fully appreciate that because you (45:56 - 45:58)
know you play it every day and you're (45:57 - 46:00)
like I'm I'm in this area I'm in this (45:58 - 46:02)
area I'm going over here (46:00 - 46:04)
um obviously more towns are are (46:02 - 46:06)
sometimes are more important than other (46:04 - 46:08)
towns but (46:06 - 46:09)
um (46:08 - 46:11)
I don't know I guess I guess so I walked (46:09 - 46:13)
away with like (46:11 - 46:14)
these games are really ambitious and (46:13 - 46:16)
it's it is unfortunate that they're (46:14 - 46:18)
they're broken and it does kind of suck (46:16 - 46:20)
that like you fall through the floor or (46:18 - 46:22)
your game crashes but like (46:20 - 46:25)
these are really a bit they are really (46:22 - 46:26)
ambitious I don't think anybody denies (46:25 - 46:28)
that they are ambitious (46:26 - 46:30)
I think the question is is were they (46:28 - 46:34)
were they too ambitious yeah for what (46:30 - 46:37)
they what they what they budgeted and (46:34 - 46:40)
planned for and I think the answer at I (46:37 - 46:42)
think we have to say that yeah they were (46:40 - 46:44)
too ambitious for (46:42 - 46:47)
what they actually could produce it is a (46:44 - 46:51)
it is a very very buggy game (46:47 - 46:53)
um (46:51 - 46:53)
the question is is what is the remedy to (46:53 - 46:57)
that and I I don't know because I don't (46:55 - 47:01)
think time is the remedy to that no I (46:57 - 47:03)
mean I think (47:01 - 47:03)
and I was thinking about that more as I (47:03 - 47:08)
was playing and the the third the third (47:05 - 47:11)
takeaway I had is (47:08 - 47:12)
I never (47:11 - 47:15)
I I I I I think I ended up winning like (47:12 - 47:18)
500 for the the two days like I I I went (47:15 - 47:20)
I went like six and one in the the (47:18 - 47:22)
competitive battle thing which I'm like (47:20 - 47:24)
really proud of like I I there was four (47:22 - 47:26)
divisions I I did well enough that they (47:24 - 47:28)
put me in division one with all like the (47:26 - 47:31)
pro players I beat one pro player I got (47:28 - 47:32)
eliminated by the second it was just (47:31 - 47:34)
single round elimination so like I'm (47:32 - 47:36)
really proud of that but in order to get (47:34 - 47:38)
to six and one (47:36 - 47:41)
I spent 12 hours straight after a four (47:38 - 47:44)
hour speed run trying to build a team (47:41 - 47:47)
from scratch with no Terror shards no (47:44 - 47:50)
experience candy no way to like trade or (47:47 - 47:53)
help like thinking do I beat the Elite (47:50 - 47:55)
Four and try to get through area zero (47:53 - 47:57)
for a small chance to find a six star (47:55 - 48:00)
raid to get a small chance of dropping a (47:57 - 48:02)
hidden Ability capsule because so many (48:00 - 48:04)
Pokemons good abilities are hidden (48:02 - 48:06)
abilities which (48:04 - 48:08)
don't exist in the wild (48:06 - 48:12)
and I I was mentally exhausted from (48:08 - 48:14)
doing all of that (48:12 - 48:16)
um (48:14 - 48:18)
but I I also like doing all of that and (48:16 - 48:20)
being like okay well I never want to do (48:18 - 48:21)
this again (48:20 - 48:24)
I also thought like I wouldn't be upset (48:21 - 48:27)
if Pokemon games went back to kind of (48:24 - 48:29)
like sword and shield where they're (48:27 - 48:31)
they're linear in a way but there's (48:29 - 48:34)
multiple open areas like I am still (48:31 - 48:36)
thinking about the crown Tundra and (48:34 - 48:38)
thinking about the Isle of armor (48:36 - 48:39)
I thought those areas were fantastic (48:38 - 48:42)
they were and I I don't think I really (48:39 - 48:44)
needed to like walk from the crown (48:42 - 48:48)
Tundra to the Isle of armor to feel (48:44 - 48:51)
like a connector like it's cool when it (48:48 - 48:52)
it's cool that you can walk everywhere (48:51 - 48:56)
in scarlet and violet but also like you (48:52 - 48:58)
could just fly oh no (48:56 - 49:01)
I I feel differently about it I love (48:58 - 49:02)
being able to live in the Pokemon world (49:01 - 49:04)
and just have the whole thing available (49:02 - 49:06)
to me and I think that especially the (49:04 - 49:10)
story benefited or could benefit from (49:06 - 49:13)
being non-linear in the way that it was (49:10 - 49:15)
I know that there is a big conversation (49:13 - 49:18)
there and a lot of debate there but in (49:15 - 49:20)
my experience I greatly benefited from (49:18 - 49:22)
it and the story to me was good because (49:20 - 49:25)
of it (49:22 - 49:25)
I I no I I liked it I just I wouldn't be (49:26 - 49:31)
upset if we went back to a little bit (49:29 - 49:34)
more linear of the game if that a little (49:31 - 49:37)
bit more linear fixes all the issues I (49:34 - 49:39)
mean I still stand by you have to tell a (49:37 - 49:40)
much smaller (49:39 - 49:42)
and shallower story (49:40 - 49:45)
when you cannot control (49:42 - 49:48)
when people interact with things if you (49:45 - 49:50)
do not have a linear path you cannot (49:48 - 49:54)
tell a very deep story (49:50 - 49:54)
there's probably an open world game that (49:56 - 50:00)
does a good story that I can't think of (49:58 - 50:02)
but speaking of stories (50:00 - 50:05)
good transition (50:02 - 50:07)
uh this is off Nintendo soup uh Pokemon (50:05 - 50:09)
scarlet and violet Xenoblade 3 and (50:07 - 50:12)
Splatoon 3 among winners of the 2022 (50:09 - 50:15)
famitsu Game Awards (50:12 - 50:18)
uh which this was a week ago (50:15 - 50:19)
so this is where the games that came out (50:18 - 50:21)
in 2022 (50:19 - 50:25)
that they now decided when this year (50:21 - 50:26)
this it makes sense right yeah and I (50:25 - 50:28)
don't think this is confusing Daniel and (50:26 - 50:29)
I know it's 2023 but these are the games (50:28 - 50:32)
for 2022. (50:29 - 50:32)
um we'll go through we'll go we'll go (50:33 - 50:37)
through these uh so game of the year (50:34 - 50:40)
your choices were Splatoon 3 (50:37 - 50:43)
uh Elden ring scarlet and violet Legends (50:40 - 50:46)
Arceus and uh Monster Hunter rise Sun (50:43 - 50:48)
Break which is crazy that two Pokemon (50:46 - 50:50)
games were considered for Game of the (50:48 - 50:52)
Year from femitsu uh the winner was (50:50 - 50:54)
Elden ring (50:52 - 50:56)
I don't think that's a surprise it's a (50:54 - 50:58)
surprise surprise though I don't think (50:56 - 51:00)
anybody's surprised (50:58 - 51:00)
um the most valuable Creator uh we have (51:02 - 51:07)
game freak Nintendo's Splatoon 3 Dev (51:04 - 51:10)
team uh Yoshida uh the heaven Burns Red (51:07 - 51:12)
Team I'm actually not sure who that is (51:10 - 51:14)
uh and then from software from software (51:12 - 51:15)
one (51:14 - 51:19)
um if from software makes Elden ring (51:15 - 51:21)
best scenario I don't know what the (51:19 - 51:24)
rules here were uh but the choices were (51:21 - 51:27)
Pokemon Scarlet Violet Xenoblade 3 and (51:24 - 51:31)
Heavens burn red and uh scarlet and (51:27 - 51:33)
violet won best scenario (51:31 - 51:36)
I'm not 100 sure (51:33 - 51:39)
what that means I mean I think it's I (51:36 - 51:40)
think we would translate it into a story (51:39 - 51:42)
yeah I think that that's what it was I (51:40 - 51:44)
was seeing people saying that scarlet (51:42 - 51:47)
and violet won best story oh okay I why (51:44 - 51:49)
was there only three choices (51:47 - 51:52)
but they're not I don't know what (51:49 - 51:54)
famitsu is putting on yeah I don't I (51:52 - 51:56)
don't understand how the choices were (51:54 - 51:58)
made like I don't I don't get why like (51:56 - 52:01)
God of War or her is it Horizon (51:58 - 52:03)
forbidden West would not also be (52:01 - 52:06)
considered under best story I think that (52:03 - 52:08)
they may have been considered but it (52:06 - 52:10)
looks like from the link we are using (52:08 - 52:12)
from the show notes that these are all (52:10 - 52:14)
winners and that there is a top winner (52:12 - 52:17)
and then maybe maybe uh (52:14 - 52:20)
special Awards or (52:17 - 52:23)
something like that yeah Runners up (52:20 - 52:26)
uh best graphics you have Horizon for (52:23 - 52:28)
Britain West God of War the winner is (52:26 - 52:30)
Elden ring (52:28 - 52:31)
um best music scarlet and violet was (52:30 - 52:34)
considered for this Xenoblade 3 the (52:31 - 52:37)
winner was Heaven's Heaven Burns Red (52:34 - 52:40)
uh best actor (52:37 - 52:42)

best actor uh best voice actor that was (52:45 - 52:53)

character uh we have somebody from (52:53 - 52:59)
Heaven Burns Red we have Kirby from (52:56 - 53:01)
Kirby and the Forgotten land if you (52:59 - 53:03)
didn't know what game Kirby was from and (53:01 - 53:05)
then uh the winner was pepper from (53:03 - 53:07)
Pokemon scarline Violet that translates (53:05 - 53:10)
to Arvin why didn't we get the name (53:07 - 53:14)
pepper Pepper's such a good name (53:10 - 53:18)
hahaha which uh (53:14 - 53:19)
is there another character that would (53:18 - 53:23)
win best character and and that game (53:19 - 53:27)
like in scarlet and violet yeah I put (53:23 - 53:29)
Penny up there but yeah Penny had a (53:27 - 53:32)
pretty good storyline yeah (53:29 - 53:34)
but arvin's hit different arvin's (53:32 - 53:36)
storyline is what we call Oscar bait (53:34 - 53:40)
movies it was the same like sad and you (53:36 - 53:42)
know like actors go for these things (53:40 - 53:44)
that will make people cry so they can (53:42 - 53:47)
bag and Oscar yeah so our Urban (53:44 - 53:49)
storyline is the reason that I really (53:47 - 53:51)
enjoyed the open world and being able to (53:49 - 53:55)
choose the order you went in when I (53:51 - 53:57)
played the game in the beginning when (53:55 - 53:59)
Arvin was just being a jerk to everyone (53:57 - 54:03)
my thought process was okay you're rude (53:59 - 54:05)
I'm not gonna do anything you want me to (54:03 - 54:07)
do I am going to go through all of the (54:05 - 54:09)
other things this game is asking me to (54:07 - 54:12)
do and not do the Titans because you're (54:09 - 54:14)
rude and so I was just going around and (54:12 - 54:16)
doing the gyms and doing the team star (54:14 - 54:19)
when I passed cloth and Arvin called me (54:16 - 54:22)
to say hey this Pokemon's nearby I was (54:19 - 54:25)
right there I took a picture of it just (54:22 - 54:28)
smiling with it and said and basically (54:25 - 54:31)
said nope I am not doing this for you I (54:28 - 54:33)
am going the other way and so I kept (54:31 - 54:35)
playing this way and that was the way I (54:33 - 54:37)
was playing the game and this is why I (54:35 - 54:38)
loved having this open world option (54:37 - 54:39)
because (54:38 - 54:42)
Arvin was rude I was ignoring him and (54:39 - 54:43)
then I came across someone in the (54:42 - 54:45)
library who was saying that Arvin had (54:43 - 54:47)
had a really hard year (54:45 - 54:49)
and that got me interested in his (54:47 - 54:51)
character and that got me to start doing (54:49 - 54:53)
the Titans and that got me to learn more (54:51 - 54:57)
about arvin's story and so that (54:53 - 54:59)
was maybe the best part of scarlet and (54:57 - 55:01)
violet for me was that I had the option (54:59 - 55:03)
to say no I'm not going to do this (55:01 - 55:07)
storyline you're rude and then I (55:03 - 55:09)
surprise discovered that (55:07 - 55:11)
which I guess was everybody's experience (55:09 - 55:13)
to a certain extent but I kind of took (55:11 - 55:16)
it a step farther because I really (55:13 - 55:19)
didn't like Arvin in the beginning (55:16 - 55:21)
ultimately I feel like he had a great (55:19 - 55:23)
storyline (55:21 - 55:23)
yeah I think the uh second time through (55:23 - 55:28)
scarlet and violet for me I I appreciate (55:26 - 55:31)
nimona a lot more (55:28 - 55:31)
um (55:32 - 55:36)
she is exactly who she says she is she (55:33 - 55:40)
is great I I know people are I I know (55:36 - 55:42)
again the consensus is like why does the (55:40 - 55:44)
Rival pick the thing weak to me but like (55:42 - 55:47)
nimona's she states her reason why she (55:44 - 55:49)
does that she like she wants to make it (55:47 - 55:51)
as hard as possible for her because (55:49 - 55:53)
she's already a champion like she's (55:51 - 55:57)
she's literally like (55:53 - 55:57)
us playing at 10 years old and now being (55:58 - 56:03)
an adult thinking like (56:01 - 56:06)
how can I make a challenge for myself (56:03 - 56:08)
and she does that in this game and it's (56:06 - 56:11)
like it's it's more obvious the second (56:08 - 56:16)
time through that she's trying to like (56:11 - 56:19)
make things difficult for herself using (56:16 - 56:22)
you as that tool but also still trying (56:19 - 56:25)
to have fun yeah which is like I feel (56:22 - 56:27)
like like (56:25 - 56:30)
the definition of a Nuzlocke like you're (56:27 - 56:31)
trying to make things hard for you but (56:30 - 56:33)
you still want to have fun doing it yes (56:31 - 56:37)
she's definitely a nuzlocker (56:33 - 56:40)
I really like her she's great uh best (56:37 - 56:42)

I'm reading about heaven Burns Red (58:17 - 58:24)
is it not your type of game well (58:20 - 58:24)
Heavens Burns Red is a turn-based (58:25 - 58:29)
role-playing game which is my thing in (58:27 - 58:30)
which a player can assemble a team of (58:29 - 58:33)
six out of 48 available girls and fight (58:30 - 58:36)
against an extraterrestrial beings known (58:33 - 58:38)
as cancer (58:36 - 58:38)
so it's like (58:38 - 58:43)
kind of I don't (58:40 - 58:45)
already then (58:43 - 58:47)
I I mean I think there's dudes in (58:45 - 58:48)
kitchen impact anytime I watch somebody (58:47 - 58:50)
play against you they're definitely (58:48 - 58:52)
using engine impact trust me that there (58:50 - 58:56)
are for the little that I played (58:52 - 58:56)
I'm no surprised with like Eldon ring (59:00 - 59:03)
winning game of the year last year no I (59:02 - 59:07)
mean I um (59:03 - 59:07)
I feel like (59:07 - 59:10)
Pokemon winning this is like that (59:08 - 59:13)
actress that's always up for Wars but (59:10 - 59:15)
never wins and then finally they're like (59:13 - 59:17)
it's been so many years and this was (59:15 - 59:19)
better than everything else you've done (59:17 - 59:20)
so we're gonna give you the word because (59:19 - 59:21)
you may never come back around to this (59:20 - 59:24)
type of performance again you don't have (59:21 - 59:25)
a history of doing it but everybody (59:24 - 59:27)
loves your games (59:25 - 59:29)
so we're going to do it now because we (59:27 - 59:31)
can kind of justify it we do not ever (59:29 - 59:34)
expect you to do this again (59:31 - 59:34)
I mean I I do expect them to do this (59:35 - 59:41)
again yeah I sure hope so I'm just I'm (59:38 - 59:43)
just saying that I would be okay if they (59:41 - 59:45)
you know maybe scaled it back a little (59:43 - 59:47)
bit and (59:45 - 59:49)
we're a little bit less ambitious so (59:47 - 59:52)
that things work a little bit better (59:49 - 59:54)
yeah I mean there's supposed to be an (59:52 - 59:57)
update at the end of April so that's you (59:54 - 59:59)
know still a month away (59:57 - 60:00)
[Music] (59:59 - 60:00)
um (60:00 - 60:03)
you know what the egg thing with walking (60:00 - 60:07)
Lake and iron leaves will be fixed this (60:03 - 60:09)
time around (60:07 - 60:09)
um Hannah do we have do we have a uh uh (60:10 - 60:19)
your saved data has been deleted update (60:13 - 60:19)
which I know that a couple of people who (60:20 - 60:23)
made inaccessible have gotten calls from (60:24 - 60:28)
Nintendo reps like calls back saying (60:26 - 60:30)
they're working on it but I don't think (60:28 - 60:32)
there's been any progress made for a (60:30 - 60:34)
couple of weeks since yeah there hasn't (60:32 - 60:35)
been like a hundred more people to add (60:34 - 60:38)
to it people have kept getting it like I (60:35 - 60:39)
checked before we started recording (60:38 - 60:40)
there was someone 45 minutes ago who (60:39 - 60:42)
commented on that post saying they just (60:40 - 60:44)
they just had it happen so it's it's (60:42 - 60:46)
still happening (60:44 - 60:49)
yes I'm still under the impression that (60:46 - 60:51)
it only happens though when you freshly (60:49 - 60:52)
update (60:51 - 60:55)
that does not appear to be the case I (60:52 - 60:56)
think did they update like two weeks ago (60:55 - 61:00)
and they were like oh now it happened (60:56 - 61:02)
um (61:00 - 61:02)
possibly this the most recent person is (61:06 - 61:11)
saying that this was the first time they (61:09 - 61:12)
had properly closed the game since (61:11 - 61:16)
starting it about a month ago so this (61:12 - 61:17)
may have been the first time they had (61:16 - 61:20)
saved and closed since updating yeah (61:17 - 61:21)
because that's when it seems to happen (61:20 - 61:23)
is when you (61:21 - 61:26)
save and close the game and then you try (61:23 - 61:27)
to open it up again and you can't (61:26 - 61:29)
correct (61:27 - 61:32)
which would make sense so like I think (61:29 - 61:34)
our our I think the the internet's there (61:32 - 61:36)
I shouldn't say our Theory I think (61:34 - 61:38)
everyone speculated this is if you have (61:36 - 61:40)
if you have saved and closed your game (61:38 - 61:45)
and opened it back up you you sound fine (61:40 - 61:45)
I don't know if that's a hundred percent (61:46 - 61:51)
but it's definitely higher percent (61:47 - 61:51)
foreign (61:52 - 61:57)
yeah I mean I I post things on Instagram (61:54 - 61:58)
and people are like I'm not playing the (61:57 - 61:59)
game because I don't want to lose my (61:58 - 62:01)
data and it's like it's been long enough (61:59 - 62:03)
at this point that I can't worry about (62:01 - 62:06)
it to that extent anymore I want it okay (62:03 - 62:08)
yeah (62:06 - 62:12)
like like you you would have to you (62:08 - 62:13)
would have to have had your game running (62:12 - 62:16)
and not play anything else like I I (62:13 - 62:19)
still I like we there's you if if you (62:16 - 62:20)
have closed out the game and switched to (62:19 - 62:22)
another game (62:20 - 62:25)
I I guess maybe like (62:22 - 62:27)
you (62:25 - 62:30)
not opening the game isn't going to like (62:27 - 62:32)
solve the problem because if the game (62:30 - 62:36)
has saved in properly that damage is (62:32 - 62:37)
already done when you've closed the game (62:36 - 62:39)
that's why it's not going to reopen (62:37 - 62:41)
because there's a corruption there that (62:39 - 62:43)
like somehow the update didn't get (62:41 - 62:45)
installed or somehow when you say like (62:43 - 62:48)
it's the whole like don't turn the game (62:45 - 62:51)
off when saving like we're saving right (62:48 - 62:52)
now please don't power the game up like (62:51 - 62:54)
something along that lines has happened (62:52 - 62:57)
so (62:54 - 62:57)
it's almost like the it's almost like uh (62:57 - 63:03)
uh you know you know you have no money (63:01 - 63:05)
in your bank account but you ref you're (63:03 - 63:07)
just not going to open your bank account (63:05 - 63:10)
to look but like (63:07 - 63:13)
it does seem to be kind of that way and (63:10 - 63:15)
unless the fix that they hopefully (63:13 - 63:18)
eventually will find uh does reverse it (63:15 - 63:20)
for the players that have already had it (63:18 - 63:21)
happen then (63:20 - 63:23)
if you're someone who was going to have (63:21 - 63:25)
it happen anyways and you're just not (63:23 - 63:26)
saving and turning off your game because (63:25 - 63:29)
of it then you're probably not gonna get (63:26 - 63:31)
it back either way (63:29 - 63:34)
right (63:31 - 63:34)
but maybe you can keep your game until (63:35 - 63:39)
Pokemon Bank comes out (63:36 - 63:42)
never for sure you have to turn your (63:39 - 63:44)
game off to leave to that app (63:42 - 63:46)
yeah I don't know there's no good (63:44 - 63:48)
solution (63:46 - 63:51)
I think I think it's mostly safe to keep (63:48 - 63:52)
playing the game I am still pretty (63:51 - 63:55)
skeptical of of the go connection but (63:52 - 63:58)
again like a hundred people out of 23 (63:55 - 64:02)
million is so astronomically times yeah (63:58 - 64:04)
it is tiny tiny like there are probably (64:02 - 64:06)
more people who have lost their like (64:04 - 64:09)
Fallout 4 data or their Elder Scrolls (64:06 - 64:10)
data then (64:09 - 64:13)
then any of these Pokemon fans you ever (64:10 - 64:16)
play a Bethesda game the fact that those (64:13 - 64:20)
things turn on is a miracle (64:16 - 64:20)
have I played a Bethesda game (64:21 - 64:24)
have you I feel like I don't know that I (64:25 - 64:30)
have I feel like I have like a but I (64:27 - 64:31)
feel like you would like like an Alden (64:30 - 64:33)
or or not a (64:31 - 64:37)
Elder Scrolls or something oh I have I (64:33 - 64:39)
did try to play like Morrowind the (64:37 - 64:41)
Skyrims and I did not (64:39 - 64:43)
um one of my little brothers gave me (64:41 - 64:45)
Skyrim for my birthday once on an old (64:43 - 64:46)
computer where I opened it up and it (64:45 - 64:48)
froze my entire computer and I could (64:46 - 64:51)
never open the game again so so that was (64:48 - 64:56)
never an option for me solid solid (64:51 - 64:56)
well I will tell you uh you know after (64:57 - 65:04)
uh Community Day yeah because I think uh (65:00 - 65:06)
