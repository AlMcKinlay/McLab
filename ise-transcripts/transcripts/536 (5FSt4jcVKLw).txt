[Music] (0:04 - 0:21)
hello what's up hi this is a weird (0:22 - 0:29)
recording because it'll be uh the first (0:26 - 0:31)
for people to listen or it will be (0:29 - 0:33)
included in the normal podcast so (0:31 - 0:35)
wherever you're listening hi welcome (0:33 - 0:38)
what if they're viewing our viewing or (0:35 - 0:41)
viewing uh hi my name is Steve uh with (0:38 - 0:45)
me is Greg hi and also with me as will (0:41 - 0:48)
yes that is me I'm here okay your (0:45 - 0:53)
resident not Boomers oh my word I feel (0:48 - 0:55)
like I have more Boomer than you guys (0:53 - 0:59)
are you are uh okay so I was invited out (0:55 - 1:03)
to New York to play scarlet and violet (0:59 - 1:07)
early I played a full hour by the time (1:03 - 1:10)
that this is posted and published the (1:07 - 1:12)
Embargo should be lifted uh so there (1:10 - 1:14)
should be a lot of coverage actually uh (1:12 - 1:17)
about scarlet and violet (1:14 - 1:20)
um I I was told that the UK offices had (1:17 - 1:23)
their own preview so I'm sure from UK (1:20 - 1:26)
the European content creators that will (1:23 - 1:30)
go out uh I know when I was there (1:26 - 1:30)
um (1:30 - 1:33)
there were other people in I was told (1:30 - 1:36)
like polygon IGN all of those people (1:33 - 1:38)
came through like they always do but (1:36 - 1:39)
this was the first time that they (1:38 - 1:42)
invited more content creators and they (1:39 - 1:44)
invited me so very flattering cute shout (1:42 - 1:45)
out to Nintendo and to the Pokemon (1:44 - 1:48)
company for doing that (1:45 - 1:50)
for the record just to be completely (1:48 - 1:52)
transparent they did not pay for me to (1:50 - 1:53)
come out to New York (1:52 - 1:58)
uh I paid for myself uh so uh was that (1:53 - 2:00)
worth the flight and hotel to play (1:58 - 2:03)
Scarlet Violet early (2:00 - 2:06)
I don't know yet I only got to play an (2:03 - 2:07)
hour (2:06 - 2:08)
um (2:07 - 2:12)
uh initial reaction no that's not a (2:08 - 2:15)
cheap trip to play a game for an hour I (2:12 - 2:17)
I think I think for me it's worth it in (2:15 - 2:19)
the perspective that I'm able to I it's (2:17 - 2:21)
worth it I think because I'm able to (2:19 - 2:24)
give people perspective on what I played (2:21 - 2:27)
and I think there's value there to our (2:24 - 2:28)
audience (2:27 - 2:30)
um I think if Greg was just going to (2:28 - 2:31)
play it (2:30 - 2:33)
and then come back and then not make any (2:31 - 2:35)
content about it I'd be like ah probably (2:33 - 2:37)
not worth it so I think for the average (2:35 - 2:39)
person probably not worth a day trip to (2:37 - 2:41)
New York I haven't seen a show or (2:39 - 2:43)
visited friends I mean I would have made (2:41 - 2:44)
it worth it well and yeah just to play (2:43 - 2:47)
the game what four weeks early and not (2:44 - 2:49)
even the full game like five weeks early (2:47 - 2:51)
yeah (2:49 - 2:53)
um that's a good point I will say that (2:51 - 2:56)
they they told me that what I played was (2:53 - 2:58)
not the final version of the game uh (2:56 - 2:59)
there was a point where the lettuce (2:58 - 3:02)
glitched through the table (2:59 - 3:02)
because I've known you for a decade and (3:10 - 3:13)
you would never put lettuce on a (3:11 - 3:15)
sandwich correct that's true it was one (3:13 - 3:17)
you will never be able to complete that (3:15 - 3:19)
portion of the game because you can't (3:17 - 3:22)
have right vegetable paper on your (3:19 - 3:24)
sandwich uh we could get to the picnic (3:22 - 3:28)
Park part uh so I played for a full hour (3:24 - 3:29)
um they they ran through the whole (3:28 - 3:32)
embargo stuff of like what I can and (3:29 - 3:33)
cannot talk about (3:32 - 3:36)
um so an example would be like if a (3:33 - 3:39)
returning Pokemon showed up like if I (3:36 - 3:42)
saw cramerant in the wild I wouldn't be (3:39 - 3:43)
able to tell you guys I saw cramerant (3:42 - 3:46)
because cramerant hasn't officially been (3:43 - 3:47)
shown (3:46 - 3:49)
um so whether or not I saw Kramer I (3:47 - 3:51)
wouldn't be able to discuss it (3:49 - 3:51)
um (3:51 - 3:55)
so just disclosure there I did see new (3:51 - 3:58)
Pokemon that have not been revealed I'm (3:55 - 4:00)
not allowed to talk about those again (3:58 - 4:02)
until they're officially revealed they (4:00 - 4:04)
were very they were things that I was (4:02 - 4:07)
not able to talk about they also when (4:04 - 4:09)
they showed the map of the world they (4:07 - 4:11)
drew this like huge black line around it (4:09 - 4:12)
it was almost like a PowerPoint (4:11 - 4:14)
presentation and they're like you can go (4:12 - 4:17)
anywhere within this black line (4:14 - 4:20)
and I was like well I've never played (4:17 - 4:22)
the game so how would I know where that (4:20 - 4:24)
black line is in relation to the game (4:22 - 4:27)
but they had like two every state there (4:24 - 4:28)
were four stations every station had two (4:27 - 4:30)
Nintendo reps or (4:28 - 4:32)
so while some stations had a Nintendo (4:30 - 4:34)
rep and a Pokemon rep (4:32 - 4:36)
um which is the Border guards as you (4:34 - 4:37)
might call them and they were like we (4:36 - 4:41)
will tell you if you are yeah (4:37 - 4:43)
um they were like you have an hour to (4:41 - 4:46)
play you can play however you want they (4:43 - 4:49)
were like we want you to experience a (4:46 - 4:51)
Titan battle we want you to experience a (4:49 - 4:53)
gym battle and we want you to experience (4:51 - 4:55)
a team Star Battle (4:53 - 4:56)
um (4:55 - 4:58)
you don't have to do that though if they (4:56 - 4:59)
were like if you want to spend the hour (4:58 - 5:01)
catching Le chunk We're not gonna stop (4:59 - 5:03)
you uh it's your hour do with it what (5:01 - 5:06)
you want and then there was also a after (5:03 - 5:09)
the hour session (5:06 - 5:10)
um we took like a 10 minute break and (5:09 - 5:12)
then there was like a a session where (5:10 - 5:15)
the four of us who were invited well I (5:12 - 5:17)
was I was there was three days it was (5:15 - 5:18)
Monday Tuesday Wednesday I was the last (5:17 - 5:20)
appointment on Wednesday which was the (5:18 - 5:21)
last day (5:20 - 5:24)
um and then the four people in my set (5:21 - 5:26)
the three other people in my session we (5:24 - 5:27)
were going to do a Tarot Raid Battle (5:26 - 5:30)
together to experience that (5:27 - 5:32)
so that's everything I've done (5:30 - 5:33)
um (5:32 - 5:35)
so I'll hand it over (5:33 - 5:39)
to YouTube of like now that we've seen (5:35 - 5:43)
all of this coverage of this game and (5:39 - 5:45)
we're a month away (5:43 - 5:49)
what burning questions do you have do (5:45 - 5:51)
you know (5:49 - 5:54)
if there's a set gym order can we talk (5:51 - 5:56)
about that (5:54 - 5:56)
um (5:57 - 6:01)
they who can't we talk about that (5:57 - 6:04)
they told me that you can do the gyms in (6:01 - 6:08)
any order which we know okay that (6:04 - 6:10)
doesn't help (6:08 - 6:10)
required to do them in a certain order (6:12 - 6:17)
if you can do them in any order then (6:14 - 6:20)
right that's the answer you can yeah (6:17 - 6:23)
technically you can go to any area in (6:20 - 6:26)
MMO but you'll die when you get there uh (6:23 - 6:29)
well that's a different question yeah um (6:26 - 6:31)
so the gym they had us do was the grass (6:29 - 6:33)
gym uh (6:31 - 6:36)
what's that dude's name uh I can't ever (6:33 - 6:39)
remember his name brassius gracias (6:36 - 6:43)
uh so they had us do brassius (6:39 - 6:45)
it's something like that because it (6:43 - 6:47)
sounds like it could be gracias but it's (6:45 - 6:49)
not so there there are fast travel (6:47 - 6:51)
points around the map uh just like in (6:49 - 6:54)
Legends Arceus you can they I I I will (6:51 - 6:56)
say and I should be clear here yeah it's (6:54 - 6:59)
brassius we we uh the only version they (6:56 - 7:01)
had us play was Scarlet they did not (6:59 - 7:03)
none of the stations had Violet so (7:01 - 7:04)
everyone (7:03 - 7:08)
is riding a ride on I don't know (7:04 - 7:10)
if you're going to the past or anything (7:08 - 7:11)
in the in the future we don't know if (7:10 - 7:14)
there's if Brock has a rocket ship in (7:11 - 7:16)
this game you got nothing we're left (7:14 - 7:20)
with pebbles and a giant Tyrant so right (7:16 - 7:23)
out of the gate I started at my house on (7:20 - 7:25)
a corridon and they said that this is a (7:23 - 7:27)
special build they also said my karidon (7:25 - 7:31)
can fly swim climb drive and that (7:27 - 7:33)
corridon would not have all of these (7:31 - 7:35)
things right out of the gate but the (7:33 - 7:36)
reason they gave that to me is obviously (7:35 - 7:39)
so I could Traverse the world and have (7:36 - 7:41)
that experience did they give you a team (7:39 - 7:44)
to start with already yeah uh so they I (7:41 - 7:48)
had six Pokemon all level 25 I had um (7:44 - 7:51)
set Titan I had belly bolt so that was (7:48 - 7:52)
the first time I actually saw belly (7:51 - 7:54)
bolts before everyone I can talk about (7:52 - 7:55)
that now (7:54 - 7:59)
um I had uh for for for rap for for (7:55 - 8:00)
rigorath (7:59 - 8:01)
um (8:00 - 8:05)
I had uh armor Rouge or armor Rogue (8:01 - 8:07)
however you say that (8:05 - 8:09)
um and then what my uh Wiglet I had a (8:07 - 8:10)
Wiglet (8:09 - 8:13)
and then gosh I'm blanking on the last (8:10 - 8:15)
part should have taken notes (8:13 - 8:17)
what's wrong with you uh look it was an (8:15 - 8:20)
hour and I had two people staring at me (8:17 - 8:21)
it was very stressful (8:20 - 8:24)
person to do these things I should have (8:21 - 8:26)
had another person yet taking notes I'm (8:24 - 8:29)
assuming they didn't give you one of the (8:26 - 8:31)
starters because at that level they (8:29 - 8:34)
would have evolved yes correct they I (8:31 - 8:37)
they I had no starters (8:34 - 8:40)
they also had uh six of the same (8:37 - 8:42)
identical Pokemon in the PC which you (8:40 - 8:44)
could access anywhere um that were level (8:42 - 8:45)
50 just in case (8:44 - 8:47)
some of the game reviewers thought the (8:45 - 8:50)
game was too hard uh (8:47 - 8:51)
because you know you only have an hour (8:50 - 8:53)
with the game if you're getting (8:51 - 8:55)
if you're getting destroyed by wild Le (8:53 - 8:58)
chonk like you don't want to waste there (8:55 - 8:59)
was actually an instance where my time (8:58 - 9:02)
was wasted by a strong Pokemon my (8:59 - 9:05)
Corydon could go anywhere and Traverse (9:02 - 9:07)
pretty quickly I would compare that very (9:05 - 9:09)
similar to Legends Arceus with like (9:07 - 9:11)
weird deer or bravery or basket Legion (9:09 - 9:13)
it felt very (9:11 - 9:15)
very much like the same speed and I only (9:13 - 9:17)
say that because I think there was on (9:15 - 9:18)
our podcast we had debate whether like (9:17 - 9:21)
the bike slash traversing and sword and (9:18 - 9:23)
shield felt slower or faster than (9:21 - 9:25)
Legends I think Legends the traversing (9:23 - 9:27)
the world felt much quicker than sword (9:25 - 9:28)
and shield stuff (9:27 - 9:31)
moving around on corridon felt very (9:28 - 9:35)
Legends Arceus in a good way (9:31 - 9:37)
um but that that anyways that brings me (9:35 - 9:40)
to getting to the first gym I'm assuming (9:37 - 9:41)
it's the first gym because it's the (9:40 - 9:44)
grass gym I had enough most pokemon like (9:41 - 9:46)
I don't know Milo was the first gym in (9:44 - 9:47)
sword shield I guess they didn't (9:46 - 9:50)
explicitly say that (9:47 - 9:53)
the grass gym was the first gym but (9:50 - 9:55)
that's the one they had everyone do (9:53 - 9:58)
uh and I think the the one thing that I (9:55 - 10:00)
found was interesting and I'm starting (9:58 - 10:02)
to realize this after re-watching the (10:00 - 10:04)
trailers is there's always like a silver (10:02 - 10:06)
building near the gym at least in the (10:04 - 10:08)
couple gyms we've seen in the trailers (10:06 - 10:11)
so when I got to the gym I went to the (10:08 - 10:13)
part that was the gym like the little (10:11 - 10:14)
stadium and you could stand on it and (10:13 - 10:15)
walk around it (10:14 - 10:17)
and they were like oh in order to start (10:15 - 10:19)
the battle you need to go into the (10:17 - 10:21)
building and I was like oh it seems like (10:19 - 10:23)
in order to start the gym battles you (10:21 - 10:25)
need to go into the silver building and (10:23 - 10:26)
so you go in there and then they talk (10:25 - 10:27)
about the gym leader and then they talk (10:26 - 10:30)
about the like the gym Challenge and (10:27 - 10:32)
then that challenge is the sun Florida (10:30 - 10:33)
stuff so (10:32 - 10:36)
I think it's like catch or like fine (10:33 - 10:38)
tens of Flora that are hiding in the (10:36 - 10:41)
world and they are hiding all around (10:38 - 10:42)
through time there's actually more than (10:41 - 10:43)
10. (10:42 - 10:44)
um (10:43 - 10:46)
because I I guess that would if there (10:44 - 10:48)
was only exactly 10 and you wouldn't be (10:46 - 10:49)
able to find the last one that would (10:48 - 10:50)
probably be annoying but it was you know (10:49 - 10:53)
a relatively easy puzzle (10:50 - 10:55)
um so then you find the 10 and then the (10:53 - 10:58)
gym leader shows up and uh then you (10:55 - 11:00)
start the battle it was a little jarring (10:58 - 11:03)
that battle because I'm so used to like (11:00 - 11:06)
the the the chanting or the crowd music (11:03 - 11:10)
that oh yeah sword and shield has and (11:06 - 11:14)
um when they teracolize uh there is like (11:10 - 11:15)
a pickup in music like they do do the (11:14 - 11:17)
sword and shield thing where like when (11:15 - 11:20)
Nessa Dynamax is like like the chat the (11:17 - 11:22)
crowd gets louder when the trash lies (11:20 - 11:24)
happens there's a the song does kick up (11:22 - 11:26)
um which was nice because before that I (11:24 - 11:27)
was like ah this music's just not as (11:26 - 11:29)
good as the sword and shield because I'm (11:27 - 11:31)
used to like the crowd cheering gosh I I (11:29 - 11:33)
again I'm like looking through the notes (11:31 - 11:33)
of what I'm allowed to say and not (11:33 - 11:36)
allowed to say I asked if the levels (11:33 - 11:37)
scaled which I think is a fair question (11:36 - 11:40)
to ask them yeah I was like hey if I (11:37 - 11:42)
skip brassier what's his name brassie (11:40 - 11:45)
brassius (11:42 - 11:45)
like gracias but with a B gracias (11:45 - 11:53)
um if I if I if I skip this guy and I I (11:50 - 11:55)
do other gym leaders and I come back is (11:53 - 11:57)
he gonna be the same or is he going to (11:55 - 11:59)
be stronger (11:57 - 12:00)
um (11:59 - 12:03)
and it made it seem like I I would not (12:00 - 12:06)
be happy with that answer (12:03 - 12:06)
ah (12:07 - 12:13)
but they would they would not really (12:09 - 12:15)
give me a straight answer they wouldn't (12:13 - 12:19)
say directly but indirectly we can yeah (12:15 - 12:20)
indirectly I felt like I was like (12:19 - 12:23)
reading the lines of like reading (12:20 - 12:25)
between the lines reading uh yeah I like (12:23 - 12:27)
I was reading lines but I was probably (12:25 - 12:29)
reading between the lines of like this (12:27 - 12:32)
dude is probably gonna be the same (12:29 - 12:33)
um (12:32 - 12:38)
which like whether or not I'm like (12:33 - 12:39)
reading too much in between the lines of (12:38 - 12:41)
what they say I don't but I got the (12:39 - 12:44)
impression that like this dude is always (12:41 - 12:45)
gonna be (12:44 - 12:49)
whatever level he is he was around I I (12:45 - 12:50)
think I'm allowed to say he's like he's (12:49 - 12:52)
like a lot around level 20 because your (12:50 - 12:54)
team is 24 the the team they gave me is (12:52 - 12:55)
25. (12:54 - 12:59)
um and that battle was like was was (12:55 - 13:00)
pretty easy (12:59 - 13:02)
um (13:00 - 13:05)
because I I mean like they gave me a (13:02 - 13:06)
fire Pokemon they gave me an ice Pokemon (13:05 - 13:09)
to get a grass Pokemon so I know how to (13:06 - 13:11)
tell you I look I learned from Hop I (13:09 - 13:13)
know how type weaknesses work (13:11 - 13:17)
yeah I don't again I don't know if like (13:13 - 13:20)
that's a turn off to people like I think (13:17 - 13:22)
there's the I I guess I asked you guys (13:20 - 13:24)
that question there's that excitement (13:22 - 13:25)
that you can do the gym in any order but (13:24 - 13:28)
if like I mean yeah you can't (13:25 - 13:30)
like (13:28 - 13:33)
that's not really being able to do a gym (13:30 - 13:35)
in any order if (13:33 - 13:39)
they are at a set level like I mean I (13:35 - 13:43)
guess you could in theory but your (13:39 - 13:45)
gameplay experience will be super wonky (13:43 - 13:48)
for that reason like if I go and I have (13:45 - 13:51)
all grass types I go to the level (13:48 - 13:53)
50 (13:51 - 13:55)
water Gemini somehow managed to get (13:53 - 13:58)
through and I gain all those levels (13:55 - 14:01)
then going back means I am just (13:58 - 14:03)
steamrolling everything which could be (14:01 - 14:05)
fun for people but that is not I don't (14:03 - 14:07)
think that's what people (14:05 - 14:10)
are thinking of when you can do the gyms (14:07 - 14:14)
in any order right like like you are (14:10 - 14:16)
thinking that they will match the (14:14 - 14:19)
difficulty and and still hold a (14:16 - 14:22)
challenge no matter when you approach (14:19 - 14:24)
them but if they don't scale then they (14:22 - 14:26)
don't hold a challenge whenever you (14:24 - 14:28)
approach them I also like that also (14:26 - 14:30)
brings to mind another question of is it (14:28 - 14:31)
just (14:30 - 14:33)
8 gems (14:31 - 14:37)
or I I I believe it's a gyms I believe (14:33 - 14:40)
they said that I don't know I didn't ask (14:37 - 14:41)
that question here's here's the thing to (14:40 - 14:43)
think about though because I I did (14:41 - 14:45)
another I did another (14:43 - 14:46)
um I talked to somebody else who played (14:45 - 14:48)
the game there right game explained (14:46 - 14:50)
um so I'm not sure when that's getting (14:48 - 14:53)
published and we brought up uh the (14:50 - 14:55)
conversation of like Pokemon difficulty (14:53 - 14:58)
um not in relation to gym leaders but we (14:55 - 14:59)
were just talking they asked me if I (14:58 - 15:01)
thought this Pokemon game was going to (14:59 - 15:03)
be hard I said like look I've I've seen (15:01 - 15:05)
people my age who have played Pokemon (15:03 - 15:07)
games since red and blue I've seen them (15:05 - 15:10)
struggle through Pokemon games (15:07 - 15:11)
um and then I brought up a very specific (15:10 - 15:15)
situation with my wife and how (15:11 - 15:17)
when she was playing sword and shield (15:15 - 15:20)
she got stuck on kabu (15:17 - 15:21)
um which is the fire type gym leader in (15:20 - 15:22)
sword and shield he has like I think he (15:21 - 15:24)
has like I believe he starts off with (15:22 - 15:26)
like a full uh a nine tails and I think (15:24 - 15:27)
he has an Arcanine and then I believe he (15:26 - 15:28)
ends with Center Scorch or something (15:27 - 15:30)
like that he's like three fire Pokemon (15:28 - 15:34)
and uh she lost to him three times uh (15:30 - 15:36)
she just couldn't she like she had a (15:34 - 15:37)
Dreadnought she had like pretty decent (15:36 - 15:39)
counter she was the correct level she (15:37 - 15:41)
lost the kabu like three times and that (15:39 - 15:42)
was like cool why don't you battle kabu (15:41 - 15:45)
I want to watch you play and what I was (15:42 - 15:47)
watching her do is like the the nine (15:45 - 15:49)
tails would do like Willow Wisp and she (15:47 - 15:50)
would get burned and then she would go (15:49 - 15:53)
into her items she would like use a full (15:50 - 15:55)
heel or whatever she would heal the burn (15:53 - 15:56)
and then the nine tails would willow (15:55 - 15:58)
wisp again and she would get burned and (15:56 - 16:00)
she would go into her items and then she (15:58 - 16:02)
would like heal it and it was eventually (16:00 - 16:03)
the burn was doing so much damage (16:02 - 16:05)
because you're only like what like level (16:03 - 16:07)
25 or something for that she would like (16:05 - 16:10)
eventually like lose her dreadnaw and so (16:07 - 16:12)
after I watched how she played I was (16:10 - 16:14)
like okay you're missing the pattern (16:12 - 16:15)
here the pattern that kabu is doing is (16:14 - 16:19)
if you're not burned his his CPU logic (16:15 - 16:22)
is burn opponent and if you are burned (16:19 - 16:24)
then his logic is to like do something (16:22 - 16:26)
else but if you're not burned his like (16:24 - 16:28)
default is he's going to burn you and (16:26 - 16:30)
there are certain Pokemon that is (16:28 - 16:32)
totally okay for you to be burned like (16:30 - 16:34)
your Dreadnought is okay to be burned (16:32 - 16:35)
because your water type move is actually (16:34 - 16:37)
a special move it's not a physical move (16:35 - 16:38)
so like it's really not that big of a (16:37 - 16:40)
deal you're not gonna you're still gonna (16:38 - 16:41)
have to like two shot him anyways it's (16:40 - 16:44)
okay to be burned and then once I (16:41 - 16:45)
pointed that out (16:44 - 16:47)
she was able to beat him all I had to be (16:45 - 16:50)
all I had to do was like say ignore (16:47 - 16:52)
being burned it's okay that you're (16:50 - 16:54)
burned and once she ignored it she was (16:52 - 16:56)
able to beat kabu (16:54 - 16:59)
and so it wasn't until that conversation (16:56 - 17:01)
I had earlier with game explain where I (16:59 - 17:03)
was like this is beneficial for those (17:01 - 17:06)
people even if there is not scaling and (17:03 - 17:09)
you're stuck at kabu's gym you can't (17:06 - 17:11)
explore the rest of the wild area until (17:09 - 17:13)
you beat kabu (17:11 - 17:16)
and if you can't beat and I I've said (17:13 - 17:18)
this before in the podcast and I've I (17:16 - 17:20)
and like Irene didn't lose to another (17:18 - 17:23)
gym leader she only lost to kabu and she (17:20 - 17:25)
lost the kabu four or five times (17:23 - 17:27)
she didn't lose the ryhound she didn't (17:25 - 17:29)
lose the Leon she didn't lose to the (17:27 - 17:32)
melon girl her name is melon in Japanese (17:29 - 17:33)
I can't remember what her English name (17:32 - 17:35)
is uh Melanie (17:33 - 17:38)
um her Japanese name is melon uh she (17:35 - 17:40)
didn't lose any of those people she just (17:38 - 17:44)
lost the kabu so I would imagine that (17:40 - 17:47)
like if you get to Russia and you can't (17:44 - 17:50)
beat gretia (17:47 - 17:53)
you can still do whatever you want (17:50 - 17:53)
like if Russia is 40 I don't know I (17:53 - 17:57)
didn't see Russia in my preview and (17:55 - 18:00)
you're 40 and you can't beat Russia or (17:57 - 18:01)
you're 38 you can't beat Russia or (18:00 - 18:03)
you're 42 and you can't beat Russia you (18:01 - 18:06)
can just do something else (18:03 - 18:08)
um and then come back and Crush Russia (18:06 - 18:11)
no pun intended when you want to I mean (18:08 - 18:14)
I I agree with that point but that's not (18:11 - 18:16)
the people that are (18:14 - 18:17)
that's not the people that will be vocal (18:16 - 18:18)
in English that's not the people who (18:17 - 18:23)
vocal angry like that's not those are (18:18 - 18:26)
I don't know maybe 40 of (18:23 - 18:29)
the playing audience let's say (18:26 - 18:32)
um which is fine I but I think the issue (18:29 - 18:35)
that we are that we're looking at is (18:32 - 18:37)
there's an expectation set with open (18:35 - 18:41)
world and an expectation set by the (18:37 - 18:43)
marketing of you can do these storylines (18:41 - 18:46)
in any order that is not going to that (18:43 - 18:48)
at least what we know right now and what (18:46 - 18:51)
you're explaining is not Tech is being (18:48 - 18:55)
met in spirit sort of (18:51 - 18:57)
yeah I mean I I think of a game like (18:55 - 18:59)
Elden ring where (18:57 - 19:01)
um it's weird to compare to that but (18:59 - 19:04)
like that game doesn't scale (19:01 - 19:07)
if you want to go all the way into the (19:04 - 19:10)
the deserted red area I don't remember (19:07 - 19:12)
what that area is called right dessert (19:10 - 19:14)
red velvet cake the red if you want to (19:12 - 19:16)
go on the red velvet cake area of Elden (19:14 - 19:18)
ring like the game isn't going to look (19:16 - 19:20)
at your level and be like oh man there's (19:18 - 19:22)
there's still like level 10 we better (19:20 - 19:24)
scale the enemies down (19:22 - 19:26)
um no that you know everything over (19:24 - 19:28)
there is like level 45 50 and then if (19:26 - 19:30)
you push even farther (19:28 - 19:34)
um there is even harder stuff and there (19:30 - 19:35)
are some people that can go through that (19:34 - 19:36)
game and be like I can do this and (19:35 - 19:38)
there's some people that get there and (19:36 - 19:39)
they go this is too hard and they walk (19:38 - 19:41)
away and yeah there's there's like a (19:39 - 19:44)
there is a certain order in Elden ring (19:41 - 19:45)
like that game does have like this is (19:44 - 19:47)
boss number one this is boss number two (19:45 - 19:49)
this is I think there's like seven of (19:47 - 19:51)
them before before you get to like the (19:49 - 19:53)
final boss in Elder ring and they don't (19:51 - 19:56)
scale at all like yeah like this this (19:53 - 19:57)
dude's gonna be like level 40. this (19:56 - 19:59)
dude's gonna be level 50 this is gonna (19:57 - 20:02)
be 60. and (19:59 - 20:05)
so yeah I don't know I like I mean but (20:02 - 20:06)
you you yourself had the experience (20:05 - 20:08)
where you skipped the introductory area (20:06 - 20:10)
went back and was like I'm just breezing (20:08 - 20:12)
through this I wish I knew this was here (20:10 - 20:15)
correct like yes right you like you (20:12 - 20:17)
can't say yeah that's that's there and (20:15 - 20:19)
it doesn't scale when you ex yourself (20:17 - 20:21)
complained about that exact experience I (20:19 - 20:23)
mean that is a common experience and it (20:21 - 20:25)
is going to be a disappointing (20:23 - 20:27)
experience but I I yes I'm not I'm not (20:25 - 20:29)
trying to defend it I just I think the (20:27 - 20:31)
thing that I experienced with Elden ring (20:29 - 20:34)
was there's so much to do that it wasn't (20:31 - 20:35)
that big of a deal that I missed that (20:34 - 20:37)
like starting area because I you're (20:35 - 20:38)
right I blazed through it in like 10 (20:37 - 20:40)
minutes and I was like if I wasn't the (20:38 - 20:41)
correct level I would have probably been (20:40 - 20:43)
here for a full play session like a full (20:41 - 20:45)
eight hours (20:43 - 20:46)
um but I was like I went through it in (20:45 - 20:48)
10 minutes I kind of sucks that I miss (20:46 - 20:50)
this area but there's also like a (20:48 - 20:52)
million more things for me to do yeah I (20:50 - 20:54)
mean the hope is that there will be a (20:52 - 20:56)
million more things to do in Pokemon the (20:54 - 20:59)
problem is is that most Pokemon games (20:56 - 21:01)
tend to feel very small when you compare (20:59 - 21:03)
them to (21:01 - 21:06)
and Eldon ring uh Final Fantasy 14 that (21:03 - 21:09)
has multiple continents and huge (21:06 - 21:13)
dungeons like they tend to not feel that (21:09 - 21:15)
big and one of my concerns is they're (21:13 - 21:19)
attacking in things like crafting to (21:15 - 21:21)
give you stuff to do to make you feel (21:19 - 21:23)
like you're doing more (21:21 - 21:26)
um knowing that things don't scale (21:23 - 21:29)
I mean my hope would be that they (21:26 - 21:33)
have some guidance that says that they (21:29 - 21:34)
kind of like generally directs you to (21:33 - 21:38)
like hey you should go to brassius as (21:34 - 21:41)
your first gym maybe go go over that way (21:38 - 21:42)
kid (21:41 - 21:44)
that's probably going to be your best (21:42 - 21:46)
start and not have it just be no (21:44 - 21:49)
information whatsoever you're on your (21:46 - 21:51)
own wandering right you are in school (21:49 - 21:53)
right yeah did you get to go to the (21:51 - 21:56)
school at all I was not allowed to go (21:53 - 21:58)
inside the school wow man that was that (21:56 - 22:01)
was that was a hard rule of like the (21:58 - 22:03)
schools are here to meet the professor (22:01 - 22:05)
wait wait wait wait wait oh you just let (22:03 - 22:08)
it slip you said the schools so both (22:05 - 22:10)
schools are in the game uh you that I I (22:08 - 22:12)
don't know if I let that's live I didn't (22:10 - 22:16)
actually see the school or schools (22:12 - 22:16)
uh so I'm not I'm not sure there okay so (22:17 - 22:21)
there was the big city and they said you (22:19 - 22:23)
can go to the big city I can't remember (22:21 - 22:24)
where the big city is called (22:23 - 22:24)
[Music] (22:24 - 22:26)
um (22:24 - 22:30)
[Laughter] (22:26 - 22:33)
massagosa mesogosa is the big city (22:30 - 22:34)
um (22:33 - 22:36)
they said you can go to messagosa but if (22:34 - 22:37)
you go to messagosa you cannot go inside (22:36 - 22:40)
any of the buildings inside Mexico (22:37 - 22:43)
I did not go to messagosa so I'm not (22:40 - 22:46)
actually sure there I okay (22:43 - 22:47)
I think I think we talked about the gym (22:46 - 22:49)
stuff enough it was a pretty standard (22:47 - 22:52)
gym battle it was you know (22:49 - 22:53)
it was I would I would use the word (22:52 - 22:56)
traditional it was very traditional to (22:53 - 22:57)
what you've already experienced in Gym (22:56 - 23:00)
Battles um brassius has his lines of (22:57 - 23:02)
dialogue you do the little mini game (23:00 - 23:04)
beforehand I'm sure that other Gym (23:02 - 23:07)
Leaders will have not fine tensorflora (23:04 - 23:08)
minigame (23:07 - 23:10)
um there is a cool (23:08 - 23:12)
um photo opportunity at the end of that (23:10 - 23:13)
mini game where you can take a picture (23:12 - 23:15)
with all this in floras uh and (23:13 - 23:17)
throughout the entire preview the (23:15 - 23:19)
Nintendo reps were very much like (23:17 - 23:21)
there's a lot of photo opportunities (23:19 - 23:23)
there's a there's a lot in the camera in (23:21 - 23:24)
the selfie mode and all that stuff and (23:23 - 23:26)
the filters and stuff so they were (23:24 - 23:29)
really playing that that photo stuff up (23:26 - 23:33)
um when I started my preview uh they did (23:29 - 23:34)
have the things highlighted on the map (23:33 - 23:36)
like will just suggested it was like (23:34 - 23:39)
like brassius was lit up as a thing to (23:36 - 23:41)
go to and then it was the Titan battle (23:39 - 23:46)
and then it was team star and you have a (23:41 - 23:48)
marker like you do in Legends Arceus and (23:46 - 23:50)
you can mark it on the map of like this (23:48 - 23:51)
is where I want to go and then your mini (23:50 - 23:54)
map will show you the direction (23:51 - 23:57)
to go into so it was almost a (23:54 - 23:59)
combination of sword and shield and (23:57 - 24:01)
legends Legends letting you place the (23:59 - 24:03)
marker down and then sword and shield (24:01 - 24:06)
having on the map the like flag (24:03 - 24:07)
and like sword and chill being like the (24:06 - 24:09)
flag is here this is where you need to (24:07 - 24:10)
go (24:09 - 24:12)
um so it was it was like The Best of (24:10 - 24:15)
Both Worlds and I would I I personally (24:12 - 24:19)
liked the map and the marker stuff a lot (24:15 - 24:21)
in my preview I did use it to navigate (24:19 - 24:23)
as quickly as possible so I wouldn't get (24:21 - 24:24)
lost (24:23 - 24:27)
um and I like literally right off the (24:24 - 24:29)
bat that game is so colorful and has so (24:27 - 24:32)
much Vibrance compared to Legends Arceus (24:29 - 24:35)
uh like the map was like super green and (24:32 - 24:37)
red and blue and yellow and like Legends (24:35 - 24:39)
is just like Brown and Brown and Brown (24:37 - 24:42)
and like gray yeah (24:39 - 24:45)
so um (24:42 - 24:50)
like the controls were great uh it did (24:45 - 24:51)
feel (24:50 - 24:54)
it did feel like a combination of sword (24:51 - 24:56)
and shield and legends again (24:54 - 24:57)
um it didn't I was so worried it was (24:56 - 24:59)
gonna feel like brilliantime and Shining (24:57 - 25:00)
Pro like the bike in Berlin Diamond (24:59 - 25:02)
shining bro's bad the movement and felt (25:00 - 25:04)
very like sticky and Brilliant like I (25:02 - 25:05)
remember like walking through caves and (25:04 - 25:07)
Brilliant Diamond shining Pearl and felt (25:05 - 25:08)
like I was getting glued to like the (25:07 - 25:09)
walls (25:08 - 25:10)
um (25:09 - 25:14)
everything felt great uh the the Corydon (25:10 - 25:17)
felt very much like just a combination (25:14 - 25:20)
of weird deer bravery uh (25:17 - 25:22)
all of that stuff (25:20 - 25:25)
um Corydon can climb like sneezler uh (25:22 - 25:28)
how is the the battle style have they (25:25 - 25:30)
abandoned the Legends Arceus battle (25:28 - 25:32)
style oh (25:30 - 25:38)
yeah it's not there uh okay I feel okay (25:32 - 25:40)
well I'm not good night everybody it was (25:38 - 25:43)
fun wait I thought you guys hated the (25:40 - 25:45)
Legends Arceus battle style (25:43 - 25:46)
no (25:45 - 25:48)
the the battle style of the Strong Style (25:46 - 25:52)
agile style yeah yeah that's not there (25:48 - 25:54)
yeah I thought you guys hated that yeah (25:52 - 25:58)
yeah yeah yeah it's mostly useless (25:54 - 26:02)
um battle style not there how about the (25:58 - 26:05)
sneaking up and tossing behind (26:02 - 26:08)
not there (26:05 - 26:08)
I I I felt like I was negative about the (26:09 - 26:13)
gym stuff I think the gym stuff is (26:12 - 26:16)
totally fine I think it is yeah like I (26:13 - 26:17)
said I think the best way I can describe (26:16 - 26:20)
the gym stuff is traditional it is it is (26:17 - 26:23)
you know if you if you liked it in sword (26:20 - 26:25)
and shield if you liked it in X and Y if (26:23 - 26:28)
you liked it well sun and moon was (26:25 - 26:30)
different if you liked it in sword and (26:28 - 26:32)
shield next and why it felt like a ver (26:30 - 26:34)
of the one gym I played it felt like a (26:32 - 26:37)
very traditional gym experience (26:34 - 26:39)
um the (26:37 - 26:41)
the (26:39 - 26:45)
and I want to say that my entire hour (26:41 - 26:47)
with this game went by so fast and I had (26:45 - 26:50)
a smile on my face the entire time and I (26:47 - 26:52)
absolutely loved playing it but I (26:50 - 26:55)
couldn't help but think because I know (26:52 - 26:56)
some people are like you guys are (26:55 - 26:58)
negative how dare you talk about level (26:56 - 26:59)
scaling (26:58 - 27:01)
um I couldn't help but think what people (26:59 - 27:04)
would gravitate to and complain about (27:01 - 27:06)
like they didn't give me a hard answer (27:04 - 27:09)
on level scaling uh I felt like I could (27:06 - 27:10)
read between the lines and I felt like (27:09 - 27:12)
people are going to complain about that (27:10 - 27:14)
right if that is true (27:12 - 27:19)
and when I saw that there was no way to (27:14 - 27:20)
Peg a Pokemon in the back of the head (27:19 - 27:23)
with a Pokeball like in Legends Arceus (27:20 - 27:26)
my first thought process was I can (27:23 - 27:29)
already see all the reviews saying (27:26 - 27:33)
why did you take a step backwards (27:29 - 27:36)
um in the same breath there were people (27:33 - 27:39)
who did not like that in Legends Arceus (27:36 - 27:42)
uh and (27:39 - 27:45)
when I noticed that was gone and I was (27:42 - 27:47)
like hey can I talk about that and they (27:45 - 27:49)
were like yeah (27:47 - 27:51)
I I I don't (27:49 - 27:53)
even if I wanted to defend that decision (27:51 - 27:56)
I don't know how to defend that decision (27:53 - 27:59)
if I wanted to because of this in the (27:56 - 28:02)
same instance if you didn't like that in (27:59 - 28:05)
Legends Arceus you could still just run (28:02 - 28:08)
into the Pokemon and have a battle (28:05 - 28:09)
um (28:08 - 28:12)
and that's not there uh (28:09 - 28:15)
uh like there if you watch the recent (28:12 - 28:19)
14-minute trailer they show uh a (28:15 - 28:21)
character running with a giraffe rig and (28:19 - 28:23)
they run into a venonat and that battle (28:21 - 28:25)
running into that battle was very (28:23 - 28:26)
seamless (28:25 - 28:29)
and that is how it is that there was no (28:26 - 28:31)
cut in that trailer that trailer was (28:29 - 28:34)
exactly giving you what the game did and (28:31 - 28:35)
it's funny because I was uh reviewing (28:34 - 28:37)
that trailer earlier this week on my (28:35 - 28:39)
twitch and I was like I don't know if (28:37 - 28:40)
there's a cut there and chat was like (28:39 - 28:42)
yeah it looks cut or some chat was like (28:40 - 28:44)
it doesn't look Cut I knew that it (28:42 - 28:45)
wasn't cut because I played it I just (28:44 - 28:48)
couldn't say anything but yeah it like (28:45 - 28:50)
running into (28:48 - 28:52)
um like I ran into a Le chunk and it was (28:50 - 28:54)
very seamless right like the battle (28:52 - 28:57)
there was no like (28:54 - 28:57)
like black screen like like you go right (28:57 - 29:01)
into the battle like (29:00 - 29:04)
exactly like Legends Arceus almost like (29:01 - 29:06)
I would have to like like boot up (29:04 - 29:08)
Legends Arceus and run into like an Ursa (29:06 - 29:09)
ring but exactly like that where like (29:08 - 29:11)
the two Pokemon stance the battle is (29:09 - 29:13)
start you pick your move they pick their (29:11 - 29:14)
move (29:13 - 29:17)
um the only difference from Legends is (29:14 - 29:20)
you cannot move your character around (29:17 - 29:22)
but you can still move the camera around (29:20 - 29:25)
which I think is fine because like in (29:22 - 29:27)
Legends you could take damage and get (29:25 - 29:29)
hurt that's not here in this game like (29:27 - 29:33)
you you can't get like hyper beamed by (29:29 - 29:35)
an artillery (29:33 - 29:36)
um there is no (29:35 - 29:38)
that that's another change right like (29:36 - 29:40)
you we've played Legends for the last (29:38 - 29:43)
year not the last well almost a year and (29:40 - 29:44)
you're just kind of like oh yeah this (29:43 - 29:46)
game you can take damage in (29:44 - 29:50)
um that's not here in scarlet and violet (29:46 - 29:53)
um but yeah I I would be lying if I I (29:50 - 29:56)
said that it was it felt so great and it (29:53 - 29:59)
felt so fluid to see like a horde of (29:56 - 30:02)
Pikachu and just whip four Pokeballs and (29:59 - 30:03)
catch four Pikachu (30:02 - 30:07)
almost instantly and for me to go into a (30:03 - 30:07)
battle (30:07 - 30:10)
weaken the lechonk throw the Pokeball (30:07 - 30:12)
catch the little chunk and I just (30:10 - 30:14)
couldn't help but think in this time (30:12 - 30:17)
frame I could have caught five or six (30:14 - 30:19)
Pokemon in Legends Arceus (30:17 - 30:22)
uh so the the word you'll probably hear (30:19 - 30:25)
a lot in my preview is a lot of this is (30:22 - 30:30)
very traditional so you do have to you (30:25 - 30:31)
have to start the battle (30:30 - 30:35)
make whatever mechanic to catch you (30:31 - 30:37)
can't there's just no way not even (30:35 - 30:39)
straight up to their face throwing just (30:37 - 30:41)
tossing a ball you have to go into the (30:39 - 30:43)
battle mode and then do catch from there (30:41 - 30:46)
okay yeah you have to run into them or (30:43 - 30:48)
they will run into you (30:46 - 30:51)
um or if you throw your Pokeball to (30:48 - 30:53)
activate the let's go feature and the (30:51 - 30:55)
Pokeball hits that Pokemon it will start (30:53 - 30:56)
the battle (30:55 - 30:59)
um if you if you throw the Pokeball (30:56 - 31:01)
before the Pokemon your Pokemon will sit (30:59 - 31:03)
there and then you can be like hey go (31:01 - 31:05)
attack it and then it will like move (31:03 - 31:08)
forward to attack it (31:05 - 31:12)
um so that is similar to Legends where (31:08 - 31:16)
like you could throw your Pokeball at a (31:12 - 31:17)
rock it'll start like getting the (31:16 - 31:19)
materials from The Rock and then you (31:17 - 31:21)
could like keep moving (31:19 - 31:22)
um so yeah you could like there was a (31:21 - 31:25)
group of Wiglet I threw my Wiglet out my (31:22 - 31:27)
Wiglet was like battling their Wiglet (31:25 - 31:28)
and then I started walking away and then (31:27 - 31:32)
eventually my Wiglet caught up with me (31:28 - 31:34)
did you get to like the let's go thing (31:32 - 31:37)
or is that how the let's go thing works (31:34 - 31:40)
uh yeah I use the let's go thing a lot (31:37 - 31:41)
that was something they wanted me to do (31:40 - 31:44)
like right away uh the Nintendo rep was (31:41 - 31:45)
like use your let's go thing and it was (31:44 - 31:48)
it was a bit confusing at first because (31:45 - 31:49)
it's like two different buttons and I (31:48 - 31:51)
don't remember what the buttons were off (31:49 - 31:54)
the bat I think it was like R2 to throw (31:51 - 31:56)
it I could be wrong so but then it was (31:54 - 31:59)
like it would come out because like when (31:56 - 32:01)
you throw a Pokemon out it just follows (31:59 - 32:03)
you and you can see that in like a 14 (32:01 - 32:05)
minute trailer like (32:03 - 32:08)
um like if you like I I I had for rap (32:05 - 32:10)
for for rigorath right so like I threw (32:08 - 32:12)
forever F out and I was like I love her (32:10 - 32:14)
like she's like super tall and I'm like (32:12 - 32:16)
walking around and she's like following (32:14 - 32:18)
me and then you had your character has (32:16 - 32:21)
to like look in that direction and then (32:18 - 32:24)
you hit like R1 and there's like a (32:21 - 32:26)
little red cursor that appears and if (32:24 - 32:28)
you're close enough (32:26 - 32:30)
that's the problem not a problem that's (32:28 - 32:31)
like the thing that was confusing (32:30 - 32:34)
because if you're too far it doesn't do (32:31 - 32:36)
anything but if you're close enough to (32:34 - 32:38)
like the Wiglet and you hit R1 then the (32:36 - 32:40)
cursor appears and then the ferriga raft (32:38 - 32:41)
will run towards it and start battling (32:40 - 32:42)
them (32:41 - 32:45)
so I know there was like the worry of (32:42 - 32:47)
like what if it finds a Shiny Pokemon (32:45 - 32:50)
well you have to tell it you have to say (32:47 - 32:54)
like R1 go battle also you can't you (32:50 - 32:56)
have to like be pretty close like you (32:54 - 32:59)
have to see it there would be no way (32:56 - 33:00)
where you'd be looking in a direction (32:59 - 33:01)
and be like (33:00 - 33:03)
oh there's a Shiny Pokemon like you (33:01 - 33:05)
you'd see it and then you'd have to (33:03 - 33:08)
press the butt like I I don't know how (33:05 - 33:09)
to stop it I actually don't know if (33:08 - 33:10)
there's a way to stop the let's go (33:09 - 33:12)
feature because every time I used it it (33:10 - 33:14)
was always in a group of like two to (33:12 - 33:16)
three Pokemon and I would press it and (33:14 - 33:18)
then the the foreign or the belly bolt (33:16 - 33:20)
or whatever was following me would just (33:18 - 33:22)
go in there and start messing them up (33:20 - 33:25)
and uh I I don't know if there's a way (33:22 - 33:27)
to say like hey stop attacking but they (33:25 - 33:29)
they would con they would do that until (33:27 - 33:31)
that group was gone and then they would (33:29 - 33:33)
come back to you (33:31 - 33:35)
and it's vicious (33:33 - 33:38)
and it probably went really really fast (33:35 - 33:40)
because a lot of the Pokemon I were (33:38 - 33:42)
battling were like level six seven eight (33:40 - 33:46)
and my forever my whole team was 25. uh (33:42 - 33:48)
but if you but I can confirm and you can (33:46 - 33:50)
also see in the 14 minute trailer that (33:48 - 33:52)
they gave out like two weeks ago that (33:50 - 33:54)
your Pokemon does take damage from the (33:52 - 33:55)
wild Pokemon (33:54 - 33:57)
um so like my like my photograph was (33:55 - 33:59)
taking damage even though they were like (33:57 - 34:01)
level six (33:59 - 34:01)
so I don't know I don't know how you (34:01 - 34:06)
feel about the let's go feature (34:04 - 34:09)
um like for grinding purposes or getting (34:06 - 34:11)
materials like obviously that's what you (34:09 - 34:14)
would use because it was way quicker to (34:11 - 34:17)
knock out three little chunks than to (34:14 - 34:19)
battle one la chonk (34:17 - 34:21)
um (34:19 - 34:24)
but uh (34:21 - 34:26)
I don't know if like the range thing (34:24 - 34:28)
that I experienced was because it was an (34:26 - 34:31)
early preview or because like I don't (34:28 - 34:34)
know it just seemed like (34:31 - 34:36)
you have to be relatively close to start (34:34 - 34:38)
the let's go and because (34:36 - 34:41)
in my experience of what I saw a lot of (34:38 - 34:43)
Pokemon were in groups of like two and (34:41 - 34:46)
three by the time you were walking away (34:43 - 34:48)
they were like done (34:46 - 34:50)
so it wasn't like oh here's a group of (34:48 - 34:52)
like 10 Pokemon go battle this as you're (34:50 - 34:54)
battling this I'm like headed to the gym (34:52 - 34:57)
and like it just they finished it so (34:54 - 34:59)
fast that it that but maybe that's a (34:57 - 35:01)
good thing because I'm I'm thinking in (34:59 - 35:02)
Legends Arceus like you throw it at the (35:01 - 35:04)
Rock they're done by the time they come (35:02 - 35:05)
back you're throwing in a tree they're (35:04 - 35:06)
done by the time you come back you're (35:05 - 35:08)
throwing it under the rock like so I (35:06 - 35:09)
think that's probably a good thing it's (35:08 - 35:12)
just in that preview I was like so kind (35:09 - 35:14)
of rushed that I didn't really have a (35:12 - 35:16)
real opportunity to like (35:14 - 35:18)
do it (35:16 - 35:19)
um (35:18 - 35:21)
I just like tried it and tested it and (35:19 - 35:22)
then tried it and tested it again there (35:21 - 35:24)
was a lot of times too where I had like (35:22 - 35:26)
a like I went to like I'm trying to like (35:24 - 35:28)
figure out how to like command the the (35:26 - 35:30)
Wiglet and then a pokemon would just (35:28 - 35:33)
like run into me and it would stop that (35:30 - 35:34)
interaction because now I'm in a battle (35:33 - 35:37)
with like uh (35:34 - 35:40)
whatever ran into me Le chalk I'm just (35:37 - 35:41)
gonna use the chances (35:40 - 35:44)
so it's like oh well now I can't use the (35:41 - 35:45)
let's go because (35:44 - 35:48)
um like this wild lechonk just hogged (35:45 - 35:49)
itself into me and now I gotta battle (35:48 - 35:51)
you because you're in the middle of a (35:49 - 35:54)
battle Yeah Yeah and again if if you (35:51 - 35:56)
just throw the let's go out of Pokemon (35:54 - 35:58)
and you're close enough the Pokeball (35:56 - 36:00)
just bounces off the Pokemon and the (35:58 - 36:02)
battle starts right away I don't know if (36:00 - 36:04)
there's like a backstab (36:02 - 36:06)
um a backstab is a mechanic in games (36:04 - 36:08)
where if you hit a it's in Legends where (36:06 - 36:09)
if you had a Pokemon but from behind you (36:08 - 36:11)
have like a distinct Advantage (36:09 - 36:13)
um it's in like Bravely Default and (36:11 - 36:14)
Elden ring it's in about a bunch of (36:13 - 36:16)
games I I don't know if (36:14 - 36:19)
if that's like a thing in this game I I (36:16 - 36:20)
didn't think about it until now of (36:19 - 36:22)
whether I should test that or not but (36:20 - 36:26)
yeah I think I did Test Pro that I (36:22 - 36:27)
guarantee that no one else will have (36:26 - 36:30)
coverage on because I was the last (36:27 - 36:31)
appointment and I was told by the (36:30 - 36:33)
Nintendo rep that no one has tried this (36:31 - 36:36)
this entire week (36:33 - 36:36)
and I tried it and it worked so here's (36:37 - 36:41)
here's the here's the hot take the (36:40 - 36:44)
takeaway I spun my character in a circle (36:41 - 36:47)
really fast and it worked (36:44 - 36:50)
like my character my characters stay (36:47 - 36:52)
twirling and then once I hit a certain (36:50 - 36:55)
point of spinning I could slow down and (36:52 - 36:58)
increase the twirl while I was in it (36:55 - 37:00)
which makes me think (36:58 - 37:03)
this is again I did not see this Pokemon (37:00 - 37:05)
if I did see this Pokemon I wouldn't be (37:03 - 37:07)
allowed to talk about it I have no clue (37:05 - 37:11)
if misery is in the game hmm it's not on (37:07 - 37:12)
the preview list we haven't seen in (37:11 - 37:14)
trailers if I did see it I wouldn't be (37:12 - 37:16)
allowed to tell you I want to be very (37:14 - 37:18)
clear I have no clue if military is in (37:16 - 37:20)
the game but the way I was able to (37:18 - 37:24)
control the spin of my character which (37:20 - 37:25)
they were like no one's tried this all (37:24 - 37:27)
weekend and I was like really like it (37:25 - 37:29)
was an X and Y it was in Sun and Moon it (37:27 - 37:30)
was in sword and shield (37:29 - 37:33)
um it made me seem like misery is coming (37:30 - 37:37)
back because I could control how fast or (37:33 - 37:40)
slow the spin was which I think was a (37:37 - 37:43)
thing in sword and shield with like (37:40 - 37:45)
military needs to be like spun this way (37:43 - 37:47)
or this way in order to like turn it (37:45 - 37:51)
into Alchemy again no clue I was just (37:47 - 37:53)
very happy that the spinning was back it (37:51 - 37:54)
was very it was very cute that the (37:53 - 37:56)
Nintendo rep was like literally no one (37:54 - 37:57)
has tried to spend this entire time (37:56 - 37:59)
you're the first one that's tried to (37:57 - 38:03)
spin so the spinning is there (37:59 - 38:04)
uh but it does not end with the (38:03 - 38:06)
Charizard thing but like uh I think this (38:04 - 38:08)
is the Charizard thing but like the (38:06 - 38:09)
Charizard well you have to stick your (38:08 - 38:11)
hand up in the air and you're face down (38:09 - 38:14)
yes yeah the the it did not end with the (38:11 - 38:17)
Charizard the Leon pose the yes it did (38:14 - 38:19)
not end with the Leon pose and it was a (38:17 - 38:23)
new pose and that secret character is (38:19 - 38:25)
no they ended with no pose no pose just (38:23 - 38:27)
the spinning stopped (38:25 - 38:29)
oh because the game's not finished yet (38:27 - 38:31)
yeah when they finish it they will play (38:29 - 38:32)
yeah (38:31 - 38:34)
there is (38:32 - 38:35)
um I I felt like I struggled with the (38:34 - 38:37)
controls because the controls were not (38:35 - 38:39)
the same as Legends were not the same as (38:37 - 38:40)
sword and shield so again this company (38:39 - 38:42)
has no clue what they're doing with (38:40 - 38:45)
controls uh (38:42 - 38:47)
you press the plus button to get on and (38:45 - 38:49)
off Corydon which is the same as the (38:47 - 38:51)
same the bike and and that but like (38:49 - 38:53)
there was (38:51 - 38:56)
like I think you could make her ride on (38:53 - 38:59)
Sprint by pressing L3 (38:56 - 39:01)
um which I think if you wanted to make (38:59 - 39:03)
weirdier Sprint you just press the B (39:01 - 39:06)
button L3 as you press down on the the (39:03 - 39:10)
joystick yeah that's so awkward it is no (39:06 - 39:12)
it's the same as in like Call of Duty or (39:10 - 39:15)
Apex if you want to Sprint doesn't make (39:12 - 39:17)
it good it doesn't make it less awkward (39:15 - 39:19)
if you play first person shooters it's (39:17 - 39:21)
the naturals print button I believe (39:19 - 39:24)
usually no first person shooters I don't (39:21 - 39:26)
know that there's a huge crossover (39:24 - 39:28)
between Pokemon players and first person (39:26 - 39:30)
shooter players usually if I recall (39:28 - 39:34)
correctly in Apex Legends uh one (39:30 - 39:36)
joystick is Sprint and then the other (39:34 - 39:38)
joystick is (39:36 - 39:40)
Crouch or if you had a sniper that (39:38 - 39:42)
joystick if you pushed in would be like (39:40 - 39:46)
the zoom lens on the sniper anyways (39:42 - 39:49)
um I I that I did ask that right like I (39:46 - 39:51)
was on Corydon and I was like can I make (39:49 - 39:53)
Corydon go faster and they were like yes (39:51 - 39:55)
and then they had to look it up because (39:53 - 39:57)
I guess that wasn't a frequent question (39:55 - 39:59)
either and then they looked it up and (39:57 - 40:01)
they were like L3 and I pressed L3 and (39:59 - 40:03)
then I went zoomy I went very fast your (40:01 - 40:06)
character has like this weird slide (40:03 - 40:08)
um you can actually see it in the (40:06 - 40:09)
trailer (40:08 - 40:11)
um in the 14 minute trailer it's funny (40:09 - 40:12)
because I I watched the trailer and then (40:11 - 40:14)
I went to go play the game and then I (40:12 - 40:16)
re-watched the trailer after playing the (40:14 - 40:19)
game and the biggest takeaway I can give (40:16 - 40:22)
people is the trailer is not hiding (40:19 - 40:25)
anything it is like if you see something (40:22 - 40:28)
in the trailer that is what it is like (40:25 - 40:32)
it and it's it's such it's it's (40:28 - 40:34)
you know you watch that trailer for the (40:32 - 40:36)
first time and you're like oh like what (40:34 - 40:37)
are they not including what are they (40:36 - 40:39)
cutting like what's what's missing from (40:37 - 40:41)
this but then you like think like (40:39 - 40:44)
everything's so much easier in hindsight (40:41 - 40:46)
or better what's the word like (40:44 - 40:48)
expression everything's more obvious in (40:46 - 40:49)
hindsight (40:48 - 40:51)
like when you go back and you watch (40:49 - 40:54)
legends trailers (40:51 - 40:56)
you're like this they advertised it (40:54 - 40:57)
exactly (40:56 - 41:00)
and you go back and you watch bdp BS (40:57 - 41:03)
bdsp stuff uh almost set a different be (41:00 - 41:05)
you go back and you watch bdsp stuff and (41:03 - 41:08)
you're like they they advertised it (41:05 - 41:11)
correctly like what you saw is what you (41:08 - 41:12)
got and that's probably my biggest (41:11 - 41:15)
takeaway is go back and watch that 14 (41:12 - 41:18)
minute trailer they are not false (41:15 - 41:20)
advertising anything and the phrase (41:18 - 41:21)
you're looking for is hindsight is 20 (41:20 - 41:23)
20. oh yes (41:21 - 41:26)
the it's funny because we ragged on the (41:23 - 41:29)
TM machine uh earlier this week and I (41:26 - 41:32)
already played the game at that point (41:29 - 41:33)
um (41:32 - 41:35)
and the TM machine is exactly what you (41:33 - 41:37)
think it is so if anyone is like well we (41:35 - 41:39)
don't know what it is it could be better (41:37 - 41:42)
it is exactly what it is there is no (41:39 - 41:44)
secrets to it it is you battle these (41:42 - 41:46)
wild Pokemon with the let's go method (41:44 - 41:49)
those Pokemon will drop things you will (41:46 - 41:52)
go to the machine and you will cache it (41:49 - 41:53)
in (41:52 - 41:55)
um they I was told by the Nintendo rep (41:53 - 41:59)
that League points were rare and not to (41:55 - 42:01)
spend them on pokeballs which you could (41:59 - 42:03)
do (42:01 - 42:06)
and you need leak points to make TMS now (42:03 - 42:09)
I don't know how rare Nintendo considers (42:06 - 42:11)
are rare (42:09 - 42:15)
um because I'm sure Nintendo considered (42:11 - 42:17)
watts to be rare or something and Watts (42:15 - 42:19)
were pretty easy to get but they gave (42:17 - 42:21)
like I had like (42:19 - 42:23)
500 000 League points right like they (42:21 - 42:25)
they pretty much gave me like Max (42:23 - 42:26)
currency in the game (42:25 - 42:28)
and I went to buy Pokeballs with League (42:26 - 42:29)
points (42:28 - 42:31)
because I just wanted to try it and they (42:29 - 42:32)
were like oh leak points are really rare (42:31 - 42:34)
and I was like okay well I just want to (42:32 - 42:35)
buy 10 pokeballs to see if I get a (42:34 - 42:37)
Premiere ball and I I did for the record (42:35 - 42:38)
confirmed (42:37 - 42:42)
to a Premiere ball that did work when do (42:38 - 42:44)
you get luxury balls they were the only (42:42 - 42:45)
thing I could buy was Pokeballs and like (42:44 - 42:47)
potion it was like the standards why did (42:45 - 42:49)
you even go to New York you have no (42:47 - 42:52)
answers for me no luxury man (42:49 - 42:55)
um but yeah you need leak points you (42:52 - 42:59)
need uh whatever things they drop (42:55 - 43:00)
um from my (42:59 - 43:02)
experience with the game which was very (43:00 - 43:05)
limited it was only an hour it like I (43:02 - 43:06)
knocked out three wiglets I don't (43:05 - 43:08)
remember what wiglets dropped I did not (43:06 - 43:11)
get three things in return like I got (43:08 - 43:15)
like two tears is zero surprising in (43:11 - 43:18)
what game that requires crafting and (43:15 - 43:20)
requires you to knock out Pokemon gives (43:18 - 43:23)
you a hundred percent drop rate it's (43:20 - 43:26)
just it like I would be surprised if I (43:23 - 43:27)
knocked out three wiglets and I got (43:26 - 43:29)
three things every time yeah that that's (43:27 - 43:31)
the Tia machine there is no more secrets (43:29 - 43:33)
to the TM machine you can find TMS on (43:31 - 43:35)
the ground (43:33 - 43:37)
um like right next to the grass gym (43:35 - 43:39)
there was an item on the ground I picked (43:37 - 43:42)
it up it was a TM you can you get a TM (43:39 - 43:44)
for defeating the gym leader still (43:42 - 43:45)
so I don't I'm sorry I don't remember (43:44 - 43:47)
what TM I got he gives you a TM when you (43:45 - 43:49)
defeat him so same thing your Pokemon (43:47 - 43:51)
can find TMS which I think is just (43:49 - 43:53)
instead of me picking it up I could (43:51 - 43:55)
throw my Pokemon and he picks it up just (43:53 - 43:57)
like in Legends (43:55 - 43:58)
um and (43:57 - 44:01)
that the trailer slash press release (43:58 - 44:03)
said that TMS open up when you progress (44:01 - 44:05)
through the game which I'm assuming is (44:03 - 44:07)
beating team star or beating the gym (44:05 - 44:08)
leaders or going through the gym (44:07 - 44:09)
challenge (44:08 - 44:11)
personally have the complaint where in (44:09 - 44:14)
an old Pokemon game I would find protect (44:11 - 44:17)
protect is almost always on every single (44:14 - 44:20)
Pokemon in a competitive double battle (44:17 - 44:23)
so I don't know what Pokemon I need to (44:20 - 44:25)
knock out to get more protects (44:23 - 44:28)
maybe it is super easy in my hour of (44:25 - 44:30)
playing and knocking out quite a few (44:28 - 44:32)
Pokemon with the let's go feature I did (44:30 - 44:34)
not have nearly enough resources to make (44:32 - 44:36)
I could only make one TM well it might (44:34 - 44:39)
get easier as the game goes on yeah (44:36 - 44:41)
uh but yeah in an hour of playing using (44:39 - 44:43)
let's go I could only make one TM that (44:41 - 44:46)
was like relevant to what I needed like (44:43 - 44:48)
I I could I could have made like charm I (44:46 - 44:49)
think right off the gate or something (44:48 - 44:51)
but (44:49 - 44:54)
I don't know if I I didn't look very (44:51 - 44:55)
deep in my bag to see if I even had (44:54 - 44:57)
materials to begin with it's every game (44:55 - 45:00)
was like refreshed at the start (44:57 - 45:03)
obviously I still think in a world in a (45:00 - 45:05)
real world where we've had generation (45:03 - 45:07)
five black two white two XY Omega Ruby (45:05 - 45:09)
Alpha Sapphire sun and moon Ultra sun (45:07 - 45:10)
and moon sword and shield where TMS were (45:09 - 45:15)
unlimited to take that away (45:10 - 45:19)
for crafting I don't think is the best (45:15 - 45:20)
solution (45:19 - 45:22)
and I'm not against crafting I think (45:20 - 45:24)
crafting is fine (45:22 - 45:26)
um but I don't think (45:24 - 45:29)
crafting (45:26 - 45:29)
was applied to the wrong thing in this (45:29 - 45:36)
game because most players don't need (45:32 - 45:38)
six protects (45:36 - 45:39)
so they're not going to grind that out (45:38 - 45:43)
but the the competitive players do need (45:39 - 45:45)
they need more than six they probably (45:43 - 45:47)
need like 50 protects because they're (45:45 - 45:49)
going to change their team every single (45:47 - 45:51)
season and protect is the thing that you (45:49 - 45:53)
need a lot of (45:51 - 45:55)
um and again the example of maybe I want (45:53 - 45:56)
to switch out volt switch for (45:55 - 45:59)
Thunderbolt okay I don't know I have no (45:56 - 46:00)
clue (45:59 - 46:02)
um I don't know if certain Pokemon spawn (46:00 - 46:04)
on certain days I don't know if certain (46:02 - 46:06)
Pokemon only spawn in certain weather (46:04 - 46:08)
conditions I don't know but you know if (46:06 - 46:10)
it's the night before the tournament and (46:08 - 46:13)
you need belly bolt guts and belly bolt (46:10 - 46:14)
that only spawns on Monday Tuesday (46:13 - 46:16)
Wednesday and it's a Friday (46:14 - 46:19)
like that just is such an inconvenience (46:16 - 46:22)
to change your clock to knock out belly (46:19 - 46:25)
bolt to then buy the correct TM (46:22 - 46:27)
and that doesn't (46:25 - 46:29)
benefit the person who is probably using (46:27 - 46:32)
the TM machine the most which is your (46:29 - 46:33)
competitive players (46:32 - 46:35)
for somebody who is just going through (46:33 - 46:37)
and enjoying the game I'm sure it's (46:35 - 46:39)
enough I'm sure it's fine (46:37 - 46:44)
oh I will not use natms so yes I rarely (46:39 - 46:45)
do exactly (46:44 - 46:47)
um but yeah the TM machine is exactly (46:45 - 46:49)
what they advertised it as (46:47 - 46:51)
um I don't think there's any secrets (46:49 - 46:52)
they're hiding for that it is really (46:51 - 46:55)
cool though it is it is it is cool that (46:52 - 46:58)
um I will say like it'll show your sixth (46:55 - 46:59)
Pokemon you can go through the TM (46:58 - 47:01)
machine it'll show if you already have (46:59 - 47:03)
the materials or not right off the bat (47:01 - 47:04)
right it'll say like craftable (47:03 - 47:06)
underneath it so I think one of the TMS (47:04 - 47:10)
I crafted was um nightshade (47:06 - 47:11)
um I don't remember what I knocked out (47:10 - 47:12)
to get I think I knocked out like a (47:11 - 47:14)
murkrow actually I don't know if I'm (47:12 - 47:16)
allowed to say mercuro hold on yes okay (47:14 - 47:18)
murkrow has been confirmed all right and (47:16 - 47:21)
I got a Mercury I was really worried uh (47:18 - 47:24)
I I really rooted that press release uh (47:21 - 47:26)
I so I knocked out murkrows and I think (47:24 - 47:30)
murkrows let me make Nightshade uh (47:26 - 47:32)
um so yeah that was like cool Serebii (47:30 - 47:35)
list of things that have been shown now (47:32 - 47:37)
I'm looking at the the the the do not (47:35 - 47:39)
this like confidential list that they (47:37 - 47:40)
said you're allowed to talk about these (47:39 - 47:43)
specific Pokemon so mercurs allowed the (47:40 - 47:45)
thing that Nintendo kept saying they (47:43 - 47:47)
were like really proud of this and I (47:45 - 47:48)
when I was talking to the guy from game (47:47 - 47:50)
explain they he also said he had a (47:48 - 47:52)
similar experience they were really (47:50 - 47:55)
proud that there was a if if you (47:52 - 47:57)
highlighted any Pokemon and you hit the (47:55 - 47:59)
Y button that Pokemon would jump to the (47:57 - 48:01)
top of your party (47:59 - 48:03)
so in sword and shield if you wanted to (48:01 - 48:05)
move a Pokemon to the top of your party (48:03 - 48:07)
you would hit Y and then you would go up (48:05 - 48:09)
and then you would hit Y again and it (48:07 - 48:11)
would flip the two spots switch well (48:09 - 48:13)
yeah that's that's been common for (48:11 - 48:14)
moving Pokemon for a long time yeah so (48:13 - 48:16)
if you went to the fifth Pokemon in your (48:14 - 48:18)
party if you went to cerulla uh not so (48:16 - 48:21)
religion um if you went to armor Rouge (48:18 - 48:23)
and then you hit Y it would just jump to (48:21 - 48:25)
the front of your party (48:23 - 48:27)
and they they were very proud of that (48:25 - 48:28)
and they they mentioned it like three (48:27 - 48:31)
times in the hour of like how convenient (48:28 - 48:33)
this was and the first time they (48:31 - 48:35)
mentioned it I was like yeah that's nice (48:33 - 48:37)
and then I forgot about it and I was (48:35 - 48:39)
moving Pokemon around and they reminded (48:37 - 48:41)
me and they're like it's really (48:39 - 48:43)
convenient you just press Y and I was (48:41 - 48:45)
like okay cool and then I got to the (48:43 - 48:49)
team flare battle and I had uh Team Star (48:45 - 48:52)
Team start (48:49 - 48:52)
and uh (48:54 - 49:00)
I remembered that time and then I like I (48:57 - 49:03)
moved I'm because I'm dumb and I I was (49:00 - 49:05)
like oh I need to move I need to move (49:03 - 49:07)
the weakness and I moved uh to tighten (49:05 - 49:09)
to the front because I was like oh (49:07 - 49:12)
whales are water Pokemon not remembering (49:09 - 49:15)
that actually is to Titan is ice and (49:12 - 49:19)
team Stars Pokemon or fire (49:15 - 49:20)
uh (49:19 - 49:22)
but I think that's a good transition (49:20 - 49:24)
into team star because they wanted me to (49:22 - 49:27)
do team star okay yeah first question (49:24 - 49:30)
okay and you can if you have to just (49:27 - 49:33)
blink once for yes twice for now (49:30 - 49:36)
is the car a Pokemon (49:33 - 49:38)
[Laughter] (49:36 - 49:42)
I am not allowed to talk about the car (49:38 - 49:47)
wow why it's in the trailer yes (49:42 - 49:50)
uh I can say that I fought Mela (49:47 - 49:54)
and Mela sends out a torkel and I (49:50 - 49:56)
battled the torkel yeah we saw that in (49:54 - 49:58)
the trailer okay and I'm not allowed to (49:56 - 50:00)
say what happens after the torkle is (49:58 - 50:05)
battled oh oh boy (50:00 - 50:05)
I'd rather be doing my job right now (50:08 - 50:14)
correct (50:12 - 50:18)
uh I will say though that the team flare (50:14 - 50:20)
gosh I did it again because they're fire (50:18 - 50:23)
so I keep thinking Flair the team Star (50:20 - 50:26)
Battle was all let's go there was not an (50:23 - 50:30)
option to not be in let's go mode (50:26 - 50:31)
um but you could send out three Pokemon (50:30 - 50:33)
which you can see in the 14 minute (50:31 - 50:35)
trailer by the way I did not notice this (50:33 - 50:36)
the first time but when I went back and (50:35 - 50:38)
I watched it you can see that they do (50:36 - 50:40)
the same thing that I did so again I'm (50:38 - 50:42)
telling you if you have questions or (50:40 - 50:44)
you're unsure just watch that trailer (50:42 - 50:46)
again that there's no there's no lies in (50:44 - 50:47)
that trailer it is so clear of what this (50:46 - 50:49)
game is in that trailer (50:47 - 50:50)
um (50:49 - 50:54)
so I sent out to Titan uh armor Rouge (50:50 - 50:56)
and I think Wiglet those are my three (50:54 - 50:58)
because they're the first three in your (50:56 - 50:58)
party (50:58 - 51:01)
uh that it will pick and once you go (50:58 - 51:04)
through that gate for team star it locks (51:01 - 51:07)
it like a trial so I would actually say (51:04 - 51:11)
like the team star Stuff felt very alola (51:07 - 51:13)
to me where like you're going through (51:11 - 51:15)
the gate the gate is locking behind you (51:13 - 51:18)
and now you're locked in with the (51:15 - 51:21)
the first three Pokemon you want and all (51:18 - 51:22)
of the Pokemon there were like fire (51:21 - 51:25)
Pokemon there was like growlis and Hound (51:22 - 51:27)
I think Hound hours but growless Hound (51:25 - 51:29)
hours you would you have to knock out 30 (51:27 - 51:31)
in 10 minutes and the 10 minutes like (51:29 - 51:33)
super generous right but it's pretty (51:31 - 51:36)
much you throw your Pokemon out and they (51:33 - 51:38)
battle I will say that even though my (51:36 - 51:41)
Sid Titan was a higher level than what (51:38 - 51:42)
that (51:41 - 51:45)
task required of me mice the Titan took (51:42 - 51:47)
so much damage (51:45 - 51:49)
um and it's because it was ice so that (51:47 - 51:51)
was like really cool to see and I hope I (51:49 - 51:52)
don't know if other previews are gonna (51:51 - 51:56)
talk about that but like armor Rouge was (51:52 - 51:58)
one of my other Pokemon took barely any (51:56 - 52:00)
damage it's a fire Pokemon it resists or (51:58 - 52:03)
the fire against fire right (52:00 - 52:05)
um so I would I would assume if there (52:03 - 52:07)
are future team Star battles they didn't (52:05 - 52:09)
say I mean we're just guessing that like (52:07 - 52:10)
this is not the only time we're gonna (52:09 - 52:13)
battle team Star right that (52:10 - 52:16)
it at least seems like to me the your (52:13 - 52:19)
type combination matters uh and I'm (52:16 - 52:21)
actually really glad I messed up and I (52:19 - 52:23)
forgot that the Titan was ice again I (52:21 - 52:24)
thought it's the Titan was water because (52:23 - 52:26)
he's a whale (52:24 - 52:27)
um I'm glad I brought to Titan because (52:26 - 52:29)
it was really cool to see how much more (52:27 - 52:31)
damage the Titan was taking because it (52:29 - 52:34)
was weak uh they have like vending (52:31 - 52:38)
machines like scattered in the zone and (52:34 - 52:39)
you could just go up to the vending (52:38 - 52:40)
machine to heal (52:39 - 52:44)
so I don't actually know what happens if (52:40 - 52:47)
your Pokemon faints but mice the Titan (52:44 - 52:49)
got down to like 2 Hp or whatever and I (52:47 - 52:51)
went to the vending machine I healed I (52:49 - 52:53)
went back and I finished it I don't know (52:51 - 52:55)
what the punishment is if like (52:53 - 52:57)
your Pokemon like if you have to start (52:55 - 52:59)
if like the time goes down faster or you (52:57 - 53:00)
have to start over I should have failed (52:59 - 53:03)
that for to like report (53:00 - 53:04)
um (53:03 - 53:06)
but (53:04 - 53:10)
uh I didn't so I I (53:06 - 53:10)
enjoyed the team star stuff a lot (53:11 - 53:16)
honestly the team star stuff I know I'm (53:14 - 53:18)
again I can't tell you what happens (53:16 - 53:20)
after torkel (53:18 - 53:22)
it was probably the highlight of the (53:20 - 53:25)
whole thing do you battle you have to (53:22 - 53:27)
like defeat 30 Pokemon and then you (53:25 - 53:31)
battle Mella yes yes okay (53:27 - 53:34)
um yeah you defeat 30 Pokemon and then (53:31 - 53:36)
um you battle Mella it does heal you (53:34 - 53:39)
in between that fight which I was I was (53:36 - 53:40)
actively thinking about because I know (53:39 - 53:43)
that was a thing in (53:40 - 53:45)
um like sword shield where you know in (53:43 - 53:47)
between the Elite Four not the elite (53:45 - 53:48)
four of the Champion Cup they like heal (53:47 - 53:49)
you every time (53:48 - 53:51)
and I remember people like complaining (53:49 - 53:52)
about that (53:51 - 53:54)
um but also those are the same people (53:52 - 53:56)
who like beat all the like trainers in a (53:54 - 53:58)
gym and then like leave real quick to (53:56 - 53:59)
heal before like Brock like we all did (53:58 - 54:02)
that uh but yeah it does like mice the (53:59 - 54:04)
Titan was weak again (54:02 - 54:07)
um I think I battled like 18 out of 30 (54:04 - 54:08)
and then I went to the vending machine (54:07 - 54:10)
and then I battled another 12 and I saw (54:08 - 54:12)
my sitting was back in red and obviously (54:10 - 54:14)
said Titan went out first against Mella (54:12 - 54:17)
and my it's the Titan had full health so (54:14 - 54:19)
I know for sure that like you get fully (54:17 - 54:21)
because once you do the third once you (54:19 - 54:23)
hit that 30th like the timer like stops (54:21 - 54:26)
and then Mella shows up (54:23 - 54:27)
um like there's no like you don't have (54:26 - 54:29)
to like walk to her or anything it's (54:27 - 54:31)
like once the 30 are done the Mela fight (54:29 - 54:34)
starts (54:31 - 54:34)
um (54:34 - 54:37)
so yeah I so (54:34 - 54:39)
the team star stuff was like kind of (54:37 - 54:41)
relatively short because like again it (54:39 - 54:43)
was very much like a trial in a Lola (54:41 - 54:46)
like once you go in it starts and then (54:43 - 54:47)
you can't leave and then you finish it (54:46 - 54:49)
and then (54:47 - 54:51)
stuff happens (54:49 - 54:53)
um the other thing they really wanted me (54:51 - 54:55)
to do was the Titan battle (54:53 - 54:56)
um (54:55 - 55:01)
and the Titan did not have a level at (54:56 - 55:02)
all (55:01 - 55:06)
and I asked I was like (55:02 - 55:08)
hey they didn't show level in the (55:06 - 55:10)
trailer and I see right here that the (55:08 - 55:13)
what what is that crab's name cloth (55:10 - 55:16)
cloth doesn't have a level here and they (55:13 - 55:18)
were like yeah (55:16 - 55:20)
and I was like do all the Titans not (55:18 - 55:24)
have levels and they were like yeah (55:20 - 55:27)
and I was like uh okay I was like I I (55:24 - 55:29)
was like there's another question I (55:27 - 55:31)
should be asking I don't know what that (55:29 - 55:33)
question is I have like more I'm like (55:31 - 55:35)
more confused (55:33 - 55:36)
hahaha (55:35 - 55:39)
I I don't know what to do with this (55:36 - 55:41)
information (55:39 - 55:44)
um so I battled cloth (55:41 - 55:47)
right it was on the mat like Arvin calls (55:44 - 55:49)
you like when you get close to cloth and (55:47 - 55:51)
he like I don't even know what he's like (55:49 - 55:52)
I went through all the dialogue really (55:51 - 55:54)
fast because I was like I I only got an (55:52 - 55:55)
hour I'll read you when I'm actually (55:54 - 55:57)
playing the game like Arvin calls you (55:55 - 56:01)
already you get close to cloth cloth (55:57 - 56:03)
jumps down (56:01 - 56:05)
um and you battle cloth and it doesn't (56:03 - 56:07)
have a level my Pokemon are like level (56:05 - 56:08)
25. (56:07 - 56:12)
um I I think for me I had to like use (56:08 - 56:14)
like four turns right it was like (56:12 - 56:16)
fifteen percent twenty percent (56:14 - 56:19)
uh like I wasn't one shotting cloth I I (56:16 - 56:21)
don't think I (56:19 - 56:23)
I think I had a Wiglet I think cloth is (56:21 - 56:25)
a rock Wiglet would probably be it but (56:23 - 56:28)
like Wiglet was like so weak anyways (56:25 - 56:30)
even with the super effective stuff (56:28 - 56:33)
um cloth got down to like 10 HP and then (56:30 - 56:35)
he like ran away (56:33 - 56:37)
like the battle wasn't over he like got (56:35 - 56:39)
down to 10 HP and then he ran and then (56:37 - 56:41)
the Nintendo rep was like do not follow (56:39 - 56:42)
him (56:41 - 56:46)
and I was like oh okay so it was like (56:42 - 56:48)
weird because they like let me see all (56:46 - 56:50)
of the Mela stuff but then they were (56:48 - 56:51)
like don't talk about it and then with (56:50 - 56:53)
the cloth (56:51 - 56:55)
they were like battlecloth and then it (56:53 - 56:57)
ran away like it ran like around and (56:55 - 56:59)
down a mountain where it was like an (56:57 - 57:00)
obvious path you would like follow down (56:59 - 57:03)
oh it wouldn't be on the black line and (57:00 - 57:07)
they were like across the border (57:03 - 57:10)
um what I will say is I couldn't move (57:07 - 57:13)
the camera at all in cloth (57:10 - 57:14)
um which was weird because I was like (57:13 - 57:17)
moving the camera around in like the (57:14 - 57:19)
macros and the wiglets and the belly (57:17 - 57:21)
bolts (57:19 - 57:25)
but the CL whatever moves cloth did they (57:21 - 57:27)
had really cool animations (57:25 - 57:31)
like animations I've never seen before (57:27 - 57:33)
um and I don't know (57:31 - 57:35)
if that was just because cloth had a new (57:33 - 57:38)
move and I'm like I again like a lot (57:35 - 57:39)
happened in that hour went by really (57:38 - 57:41)
fast (57:39 - 57:44)
um but the like I I just remember being (57:41 - 57:46)
like whoa I've never seen that move (57:44 - 57:48)
before and it like I put two and two (57:46 - 57:50)
together it was like (57:48 - 57:53)
um the move like came from behind my (57:50 - 57:55)
Pokemon it was almost like a huge claw (57:53 - 57:58)
came behind my Pokemon and if I if the (57:55 - 58:01)
camera wasn't locked it wouldn't have (57:58 - 58:03)
looked as cool as that did like it only (58:01 - 58:06)
worked because of the angle of the (58:03 - 58:08)
battle and I was like wow that's Phantom (58:06 - 58:09)
Forest or something like that yeah yeah (58:08 - 58:12)
but it was it like kind of like used the (58:09 - 58:14)
whole screen in a way that I've never (58:12 - 58:17)
really seen done before (58:14 - 58:19)
um from a Pokemon move so again I don't (58:17 - 58:20)
know if that's just like oh this one (58:19 - 58:22)
move is really cool because it's cloth (58:20 - 58:24)
signature move or I don't know if (58:22 - 58:25)
they're trying to make like (58:24 - 58:28)
the Titan battles (58:25 - 58:29)
um (58:28 - 58:30)
I don't know if they're like trying to (58:29 - 58:33)
make them like more (58:30 - 58:35)
it's like hard to say right because like (58:33 - 58:37)
I have the mellophyte and I think the (58:35 - 58:38)
melophyte was fantastic and really great (58:37 - 58:41)
and then I had the gym leader fight the (58:38 - 58:44)
Mellow fight felt great in the term of (58:41 - 58:47)
like totem Pokemon and the gym leader (58:44 - 58:48)
fight felt great in the terms of like (58:47 - 58:51)
traditional gym leader fights and then (58:48 - 58:54)
the Titan fight almost felt like (58:51 - 58:59)
like a raid fight but more (58:54 - 59:02)
like one-on-one like not four people (58:59 - 59:05)
there it really it like it it did feel a (59:02 - 59:07)
little bit more like I don't know epic (59:05 - 59:10)
or something like like where when you're (59:07 - 59:11)
four versus one it feels like you have (59:10 - 59:13)
the obvious Advantage because there's (59:11 - 59:15)
four of you (59:13 - 59:17)
um so I don't know (59:15 - 59:19)
so that's why when I I started off (59:17 - 59:21)
saying like oh the gym leader stuff (59:19 - 59:24)
might not be like that exciting to (59:21 - 59:26)
people because again I'm I'm just (59:24 - 59:27)
reading between the lines of the there's (59:26 - 59:29)
no level scaling they they wouldn't (59:27 - 59:31)
really confirm or deny that with me (59:29 - 59:32)
um but they pretty much (59:31 - 59:34)
kind of did (59:32 - 59:37)
but that's why I'm like I'm okay with (59:34 - 59:38)
everything else (59:37 - 59:41)
because like it seems to me that the gym (59:38 - 59:43)
stuff is traditional and I I'm sorry I (59:41 - 59:45)
keep using that word but like that's the (59:43 - 59:46)
best I can relate it to and everything (59:45 - 59:49)
else seems like something new (59:46 - 59:52)
that like if you're upset about the gym (59:49 - 59:54)
stuff it's okay because the Titan stuff (59:52 - 59:59)
and the team's star stuff seems better (59:54 - 60:02)
than but also comparable to what a gym (59:59 - 60:04)
thing might be (60:02 - 60:06)
so I think that's where they're really (60:04 - 60:08)
trying to go with like the three routes (60:06 - 60:11)
is like the gyms I I think this is my (60:08 - 60:12)
opinion I think the gym stuff is (60:11 - 60:15)
traditional to capture those people that (60:12 - 60:18)
just want that red and blue that yellow (60:15 - 60:20)
that Crystal that gold and silver (60:18 - 60:22)
experience I think they know what (60:20 - 60:24)
they're doing in that instance and (60:22 - 60:27)
because they were so unclear about the (60:24 - 60:29)
Titan stuff to me when I was like (60:27 - 60:32)
why does that Titan not have a level (60:29 - 60:34)
like how do I know if I'm stronger or (60:32 - 60:36)
weaker to it and they were like yeah the (60:34 - 60:37)
Titans don't have a level (60:36 - 60:41)
I wonder if that is what's scaling (60:37 - 60:44)
um yeah (60:41 - 60:44)
um so I think they're and now I kind of (60:44 - 60:49)
regret starting this whole conversation (60:47 - 60:51)
off with the gym stuff because I feel (60:49 - 60:52)
like people would have got bummed from (60:51 - 60:56)
that conversation and I hope I'm right (60:52 - 60:57)
on the Titan where the Titan is the (60:56 - 61:00)
stuff that is scaling to you I'm not (60:57 - 61:03)
sure though it could just be like (61:00 - 61:07)
like Dynamax raids where like it's (61:03 - 61:09)
actually level 25 because it's a two (61:07 - 61:11)
star but they're never gonna show it to (61:09 - 61:12)
you and like the five stars are actually (61:11 - 61:14)
65 but they're never gonna show it to (61:12 - 61:16)
you I'm not sure (61:14 - 61:18)
um but again they're they're obscureness (61:16 - 61:20)
around the tight level and them (61:18 - 61:22)
confirming Titans don't have levels (61:20 - 61:25)
makes it seem like (61:22 - 61:28)
they're trying to please (61:25 - 61:31)
old players that just want a traditional (61:28 - 61:34)
gym experience and they're trying to do (61:31 - 61:37)
something with the open World stuff (61:34 - 61:40)
um in the sense of like (61:37 - 61:40)
team star which again I'm assuming that (61:41 - 61:47)
I'm assuming that that's not the only (61:45 - 61:50)
time you see Mella right and I'm (61:47 - 61:52)
assuming there are more cloths that (61:50 - 61:54)
aren't cloths I'm assuming there are (61:52 - 61:56)
more Titan Pokemon around there and my (61:54 - 61:58)
guess would be that they are blocking (61:56 - 62:02)
areas that you cannot go to until you (61:58 - 62:03)
defeat them (62:02 - 62:06)
uh that would make sense yeah (62:03 - 62:08)
did they let you do a Raid Battle at all (62:06 - 62:10)
or is that office that off the schedule (62:08 - 62:13)
so they they took they told us to take a (62:10 - 62:15)
uh like a 10 minute break and then we (62:13 - 62:18)
did a raid battle with four of us (62:15 - 62:21)
um and I I I'm still like I don't know (62:18 - 62:22)
how to describe it (62:21 - 62:25)
except you know how I could describe it (62:22 - 62:27)
go back and watch that trailer it is (62:25 - 62:29)
exactly what they advertised (62:27 - 62:30)
um (62:29 - 62:34)
so what was interesting to me is not (62:30 - 62:36)
specifically The Raid Battle but how (62:34 - 62:38)
Nintendo framed it they were really (62:36 - 62:40)
excited about it and it was the first (62:38 - 62:43)
time ever I I felt like a Nintendo rep (62:40 - 62:45)
was talking negatively about a feature (62:43 - 62:46)
in a game (62:45 - 62:48)
they were like the old they they they (62:46 - 62:50)
pretty much said they said it in the (62:48 - 62:54)
Nintendo way that the they didn't like (62:50 - 62:56)
the old Raid Battle because it didn't (62:54 - 62:57)
actually feel like people were playing (62:56 - 62:58)
together (62:57 - 62:59)
and I thought that was really (62:58 - 63:02)
interesting coming from them they were (62:59 - 63:04)
like the old Raid Battle system everyone (63:02 - 63:06)
would just pick their move and then you (63:04 - 63:07)
just waited (63:06 - 63:08)
and I was like well (63:07 - 63:12)
you're right that is what happened (63:08 - 63:15)
and they were like they were like if you (63:12 - 63:17)
cheered sometimes it didn't do anything (63:15 - 63:19)
and I was like you are correct you're (63:17 - 63:21)
correct yes yes and sometimes it would (63:19 - 63:23)
give like a reflect and the reflect (63:21 - 63:25)
didn't matter at all because you were (63:23 - 63:27)
against like a special Pokemon right and (63:25 - 63:29)
reflect is only for physical (63:27 - 63:31)
and they were like this is really great (63:29 - 63:34)
because (63:31 - 63:37)
what you do affects everyone and they (63:34 - 63:39)
were like you don't even have to attack (63:37 - 63:41)
you could just go into the Cheer Command (63:39 - 63:43)
and there were three cheers one chair (63:41 - 63:45)
was to heal the whole team one cheer was (63:43 - 63:47)
to like increase attack power and then (63:45 - 63:50)
one chair was like to increase defenses (63:47 - 63:52)
and they were like you could bring the (63:50 - 63:55)
wrong Pokemon and still feel like you (63:52 - 63:57)
were contributing something to the team (63:55 - 64:00)
because you can cheer instead which I (63:57 - 64:01)
felt was like (64:00 - 64:07)
so they we we battled a wingle uh uh so (64:01 - 64:08)
what they had us do is because our our (64:07 - 64:10)
team was like level 25 they had us all (64:08 - 64:12)
go to the same area of the map and then (64:10 - 64:14)
they said you can catch any Pokemon you (64:12 - 64:14)
want (64:14 - 64:17)
in this area and then we're going to (64:14 - 64:18)
touch this Crystal and then we're gonna (64:17 - 64:21)
do the Raid Battle that way you know you (64:18 - 64:23)
can actually like feel the (64:21 - 64:25)
the difficulty because if you just we (64:23 - 64:27)
all just went in with 25 we would just (64:25 - 64:30)
like one shot this Pokemon okay (64:27 - 64:32)
um so I caught a new Pokemon that hasn't (64:30 - 64:34)
been revealed yet because he was he was (64:32 - 64:36)
right there and I was like I want him (64:34 - 64:38)
turns out he was a bad Pokemon (64:36 - 64:43)
because I was like oh cool I think I (64:38 - 64:45)
know what type he is and he'll be super (64:43 - 64:47)
effective against the swingle and then I (64:45 - 64:49)
the same thing happened uh which (64:47 - 64:51)
happened in another situation where the (64:49 - 64:53)
wingle terrazolizes and now it's it's (64:51 - 64:56)
like grass type and I was like well (64:53 - 64:58)
none of my moves are super effective (64:56 - 65:00)
here did you know it was a wiggle before (64:58 - 65:04)
you yeah yeah well (65:00 - 65:07)
I I didn't know it was a Wingull when I (65:04 - 65:08)
was catching (65:07 - 65:10)
I was just like very determined to like (65:08 - 65:11)
because I saw the other people like I (65:10 - 65:13)
was playing with and I saw one dude like (65:11 - 65:15)
catch a Shanks and then the other dude (65:13 - 65:16)
caught like (65:15 - 65:18)
ah gosh it was it was just like whatever (65:16 - 65:20)
like they were like your route one (65:18 - 65:22)
Pokemon (65:20 - 65:24)
um so I was like oh cool no one's (65:22 - 65:26)
catching like this new one I'll catch (65:24 - 65:27)
this new one (65:26 - 65:29)
the wingle terrazolizes into a grass (65:27 - 65:31)
Pokemon my Pokemon's moves are not super (65:29 - 65:33)
effective against it (65:31 - 65:37)
um so I end up uh I end up like it is (65:33 - 65:39)
real time like there's a 10 minute timer (65:37 - 65:41)
uh whatever for whatever reason this (65:39 - 65:44)
game loves 10 minute timers I don't so (65:41 - 65:46)
far I've noticed that like there's a 10 (65:44 - 65:47)
minute timer in picnic there's a 10 (65:46 - 65:49)
minute timer on team star there's a 10 (65:47 - 65:50)
minute timer in raid battles this game (65:49 - 65:52)
just loves 10 minute timers and then (65:50 - 65:54)
there's the HP there's no like Shields (65:52 - 65:57)
or anything so like when you attack your (65:54 - 65:59)
menu goes away and then you know when (65:57 - 66:01)
you can attack again because your menu (65:59 - 66:02)
will come back and you have the options (66:01 - 66:05)
to like attack or to like cheer (66:02 - 66:07)
um and then when you're attacked like so (66:05 - 66:09)
you attack and then your menu goes away (66:07 - 66:10)
and you can still read and see what (66:09 - 66:12)
everyone is doing and it felt like I was (66:10 - 66:14)
attacking pretty often like it only felt (66:12 - 66:16)
like five to ten seconds in between (66:14 - 66:19)
and then I noticed my team was dying and (66:16 - 66:21)
the Nintendo rep was like if somebody (66:19 - 66:22)
like faints they didn't use the word die (66:21 - 66:25)
if somebody faints you will get a huge (66:22 - 66:28)
punishment to your whole thing (66:25 - 66:29)
and so I was like okay well that dude's (66:28 - 66:30)
gonna (66:29 - 66:33)
faint and I can't really do too much (66:30 - 66:34)
against this wingle so I'm gonna cheer (66:33 - 66:37)
and heal and I healed and then like the (66:34 - 66:39)
the Wingull got like a crit against (66:37 - 66:41)
something and so by the time the crit (66:39 - 66:44)
happened and I healed the crit happened (66:41 - 66:45)
and then it came back up I was like well (66:44 - 66:47)
I'm just gonna heal again and I did and (66:45 - 66:49)
then the Tim tender rep was like you are (66:47 - 66:51)
the only person in this entire thing (66:49 - 66:53)
that actually is playing healer like (66:51 - 66:54)
everyone else just lets their teammates (66:53 - 66:55)
die (66:54 - 66:59)
yeah sounds about right yeah and I was (66:55 - 67:02)
like well well I can't like I know type (66:59 - 67:03)
weaknesses I can't really do anything (67:02 - 67:05)
against the Wingo like I picked a bad (67:03 - 67:07)
Pokemon that was my bad like I wanted to (67:05 - 67:09)
try this new Pokemon it like it had the (67:07 - 67:11)
worst moveset ever because it's like (67:09 - 67:13)
super low level and like I like why (67:11 - 67:16)
would I not heal so to go back to like (67:13 - 67:19)
rewind to like hear the Nintendo rep (67:16 - 67:20)
being like (67:19 - 67:23)
I don't really like the old Raid Battle (67:20 - 67:26)
system felt very single player and like (67:23 - 67:28)
you couldn't really do anything if you (67:26 - 67:31)
were weak like I I didn't mean to put (67:28 - 67:33)
myself in that situation but like it was (67:31 - 67:35)
like exactly what they were describing (67:33 - 67:37)
like I brought a Pokemon that wasn't (67:35 - 67:39)
good and instead of being completely (67:37 - 67:42)
useless I could still add so much more (67:39 - 67:43)
value to my team (67:42 - 67:46)
and the like real-time timer or whatever (67:43 - 67:49)
didn't feel like that it just felt like (67:46 - 67:51)
everyone was picking moves everyone was (67:49 - 67:55)
playing it almost felt like (67:51 - 67:57)
and I don't mean this negatively at all (67:55 - 67:59)
it almost felt like a pogo raid and a (67:57 - 68:01)
sword and shield raid combined but (67:59 - 68:03)
significantly better than both of those (68:01 - 68:07)
like it felt like game freak looked at (68:03 - 68:09)
like Pogo raids and was like we can do (68:07 - 68:11)
this better and then they did and it (68:09 - 68:15)
felt really good like instead of pogo (68:11 - 68:17)
having this dodge feature that doesn't (68:15 - 68:20)
even work at all the like swipe left or (68:17 - 68:22)
swipe right to dodge there should be (68:20 - 68:24)
like a cheer feature where like oh I (68:22 - 68:25)
brought the wrong Pokemon but at least (68:24 - 68:27)
like instead of me tapping I could hit (68:25 - 68:29)
like the cheer button or something (68:27 - 68:30)
instead so (68:29 - 68:33)
did you notice there was a big (68:30 - 68:36)
negative when somebody fainted like we (68:33 - 68:39)
did I did not let everybody faint I I (68:36 - 68:41)
they got really close to fainting um but (68:39 - 68:44)
I I want to say that they said if you (68:41 - 68:48)
faint you lose like a huge chunk of time (68:44 - 68:50)
oh (68:48 - 68:52)
um and we finished with four minutes (68:50 - 68:55)
left so it was about a six minute battle (68:52 - 68:57)
um and I think I think our Pokemon were (68:55 - 68:59)
around (68:57 - 69:02)
levels maybe between five and seven (68:59 - 69:04)
because we were on like a very early (69:02 - 69:06)
route and I want to say the wingle was (69:04 - 69:08)
maybe like level 10 or something I I (69:06 - 69:10)
that doesn't show the wingles level I (69:08 - 69:12)
would only guess that it was it was (69:10 - 69:14)
probably slightly stronger (69:12 - 69:16)
um but yeah it took about six minutes to (69:14 - 69:17)
do (69:16 - 69:19)
um we had about four minutes left so (69:17 - 69:22)
actually I I want to say and I I don't (69:19 - 69:23)
remember I'm super sorry I want to say (69:22 - 69:26)
like if Pokemon died of faints you lose (69:23 - 69:28)
like two minutes or something so three (69:26 - 69:32)
faints would be more than half the timer (69:28 - 69:34)
um (69:32 - 69:38)
I I think the timer is better like (69:34 - 69:40)
I think you both have been in raid (69:38 - 69:41)
battles that feel like they've been (69:40 - 69:43)
longer than 10 minutes and they just (69:41 - 69:45)
feel like a slog (69:43 - 69:47)
oh yeah where nobody's doing any damage (69:45 - 69:51)
but also the The Raid Pokemon isn't (69:47 - 69:54)
killing anybody either so it's like oh (69:51 - 69:58)
we're just gonna sit here forever (69:54 - 69:58)
and I did ask about the front code stuff (69:58 - 70:04)
I was like hey look in sword and shield (70:00 - 70:06)
um so they had to be on my friends list (70:04 - 70:08)
and then they had to enter the code and (70:06 - 70:10)
then in Dynamax Adventure you guys (70:08 - 70:12)
changed that so you just had to enter (70:10 - 70:14)
the code I was like do you know which (70:12 - 70:16)
one it is here and they said it should (70:14 - 70:18)
be (70:16 - 70:20)
when I I've noticed when Nintendo reps (70:18 - 70:21)
are not confident they say it should be (70:20 - 70:23)
they said it should be just enter the (70:21 - 70:25)
code (70:23 - 70:27)
so that was (70:25 - 70:29)
um a relief to hear (70:27 - 70:32)
the one takeaway from this entire (70:29 - 70:34)
preview is Nintendo is very good at (70:32 - 70:37)
wording things (70:34 - 70:37)
they have read the terms and agreements (70:39 - 70:44)
and the non-disclosure and the what we (70:42 - 70:46)
want to tell you and what we don't want (70:44 - 70:49)
to tell you very clearly and I'm like (70:46 - 70:50)
the entire time I'm talking to you guys (70:49 - 70:53)
I am panicking that I am saying (70:50 - 70:56)
something I am not allowed to if you're (70:53 - 70:58)
in my call center and I was greeting you (70:56 - 71:01)
each of those shoulds would have been a (70:58 - 71:03)
negative (71:01 - 71:05)
because that is not good customer (71:03 - 71:07)
service (71:05 - 71:09)
uh the other thing I wanted to bring up (71:07 - 71:11)
that you guys wouldn't ask anyways is I (71:09 - 71:14)
I saw a brand new Pokemon (71:11 - 71:15)
uh but you said you could talk about (71:14 - 71:19)
them yeah I saw a brand new Pokemon why (71:15 - 71:21)
would you bring it up the only reason I (71:19 - 71:22)
saw the Pokemon is because it was (71:21 - 71:24)
glowing yellow (71:22 - 71:25)
so if you go back and you watch the 14 (71:24 - 71:27)
minute trailer there's like a Jigglypuff (71:25 - 71:29)
that's glowing yellow (71:27 - 71:31)
uh and then when you go into it it (71:29 - 71:32)
rasolizes right (71:31 - 71:34)
so (71:32 - 71:35)
um (71:34 - 71:38)
so I see this huge yellow thing and at (71:35 - 71:40)
first I think it's like a terror Raid (71:38 - 71:41)
Battle that's like glowing because you (71:40 - 71:43)
know in in sword and shield there's like (71:41 - 71:45)
the red rings or yeah and then there's (71:43 - 71:46)
the pink ones so I just thought it was (71:45 - 71:49)
like oh this one's like a special one (71:46 - 71:51)
and so (71:49 - 71:53)
you can see this yellow glowing thing (71:51 - 71:57)
from a distance like this is why I saw (71:53 - 71:59)
it I would have never gone to that area (71:57 - 72:01)
if I didn't see this thing glowing you (71:59 - 72:04)
can see it from all like miles away so I (72:01 - 72:06)
flew my karate on down to it and when I (72:04 - 72:08)
landed I was like oh there's a brand new (72:06 - 72:10)
Pokemon I can't tell you what even if I (72:08 - 72:11)
could tell you what the Pokemon's name (72:10 - 72:14)
was it was in Japanese so what I noticed (72:11 - 72:16)
is a lot of the new Pokemon their names (72:14 - 72:17)
in the game were in Japanese and then (72:16 - 72:20)
like lechonk it said Le chunk right or (72:17 - 72:22)
like Shanks it said Shanks so I don't (72:20 - 72:23)
even know what the new Pokemon's name is (72:22 - 72:25)
anyway there's a new Pokemon that's not (72:23 - 72:28)
that's not the point of the story uh so (72:25 - 72:31)
I was like oh I want to get like catch (72:28 - 72:32)
this (72:31 - 72:34)
I want to see it in battle so I run into (72:32 - 72:37)
it and then it like so I I look what (72:34 - 72:39)
what it is and you know how you can look (72:37 - 72:40)
at certain Pokemon and you're like (72:39 - 72:42)
that's an electric type or that's like a (72:40 - 72:45)
bug type oh you can gas but yeah maybe (72:42 - 72:47)
not yeah right so I'm looking at it and (72:45 - 72:49)
I'm like oh cool I think it's weak to (72:47 - 72:52)
Electric I'm gonna I'm gonna lead with (72:49 - 72:55)
uh belly bolt right and I'm dumb this is (72:52 - 72:57)
the same instance as the wiggle of like (72:55 - 73:00)
I'm gonna bring uh a Pokemon weak to (72:57 - 73:01)
whatever it is (73:00 - 73:04)
so I run into it and then (73:01 - 73:07)
it it tracelizes it changes to a totally (73:04 - 73:10)
different type and I know I no longer (73:07 - 73:13)
have I no longer have a type advantage (73:10 - 73:17)
and I'm level 25 and it's level 40. and (73:13 - 73:18)
then Nintendo rep was like oh you should (73:17 - 73:20)
probably run away like you like you (73:18 - 73:21)
don't want to get stuck in this battle (73:20 - 73:24)
and waste your hour (73:21 - 73:26)
and I was like no I'm a gamer I'm Pro (73:24 - 73:28)
I'll be able I'll be able to figure this (73:26 - 73:30)
out and I I (73:28 - 73:33)
I try to do I do damage to it I do like (73:30 - 73:34)
30 damage I hit it with a super (73:33 - 73:37)
effective move uh after it knocks out my (73:34 - 73:38)
first Pokemon I bring in a Pokemon super (73:37 - 73:40)
effective against it I hit it with a 30 (73:38 - 73:42)
like 30 damage and then it like crits (73:40 - 73:43)
and one shots me (73:42 - 73:46)
and then I flip another Pokemon and I (73:43 - 73:47)
like try to attack it it's faster than (73:46 - 73:49)
me it one shots me so now I'm gonna look (73:47 - 73:50)
down to three Pokemon in like three (73:49 - 73:52)
turns right and I've only done 30 damage (73:50 - 73:54)
and so like I try to like I was like all (73:52 - 73:57)
right you're right I like (73:54 - 73:59)
so so before I like decide to run away (73:57 - 74:01)
I'm like well I did some damage to it (73:59 - 74:03)
and you know how pokeballs work I'll (74:01 - 74:04)
just throw a Pokeball at it you can't (74:03 - 74:07)
because it's terrazolized (74:04 - 74:10)
you have to and they actually say in the (74:07 - 74:11)
14 minute trailer against that (74:10 - 74:13)
Jigglypuff you have to break its Crystal (74:11 - 74:14)
Shield (74:13 - 74:15)
um (74:14 - 74:17)
so I couldn't catch it at all um so I (74:15 - 74:19)
thought that was kind of cool (74:17 - 74:21)
um so I like I I can't I can't just (74:19 - 74:23)
throw a Pokeball with it and like hope (74:21 - 74:25)
to run away because I know based off my (74:23 - 74:27)
last Pokemon that got knocked out I know (74:25 - 74:29)
that like I can't outspeed it so my best (74:27 - 74:31)
option is to either run (74:29 - 74:32)
get knocked out or throw a Pokeball I (74:31 - 74:34)
can't throw Pokeball so I tried to run (74:32 - 74:36)
it says I'm like you you failed to run (74:34 - 74:37)
away it knocks me out I have two Pokemon (74:36 - 74:40)
left and then I'm like able to run from (74:37 - 74:41)
it (74:40 - 74:42)
and so I run from it (74:41 - 74:46)
and it still was standing there when I (74:42 - 74:48)
was done and that was like the part that (74:46 - 74:51)
was like weird to me it was still there (74:48 - 74:55)
and it was still glowing (74:51 - 74:55)
yeah so like normally like if you see (74:58 - 75:02)
like a Snorlax in the wild area and (75:00 - 75:04)
sworn Shield right that's a static spawn (75:02 - 75:06)
like there's one Snorlax a day you run (75:04 - 75:09)
into it and then when you're done you (75:06 - 75:11)
run away it's you either catch it knock (75:09 - 75:12)
it out run away but all through those (75:11 - 75:15)
situations it's gone (75:12 - 75:16)
right (75:15 - 75:18)
the same with like Pokemon in the grass (75:16 - 75:20)
you see like a Zigzagoon you run into it (75:18 - 75:22)
you either catch it (75:20 - 75:24)
knock it out or run away and then it's (75:22 - 75:24)
gone (75:24 - 75:26)
and when I was doing the like let's go (75:24 - 75:28)
feature (75:26 - 75:31)
or when I ran into like a Le chunk and I (75:28 - 75:33)
ran away from it it was gone but that (75:31 - 75:35)
glowing Pokemon (75:33 - 75:36)
again it doesn't matter that was a new (75:35 - 75:37)
Pokemon (75:36 - 75:39)
um that glowing Pokemon after I ran away (75:37 - 75:41)
it just stood there and it like stared (75:39 - 75:43)
me down (75:41 - 75:45)
yeah it's like yeah (75:43 - 75:48)
um so I don't I I should have ran into (75:45 - 75:50)
it again because one I would be curious (75:48 - 75:54)
if that Terror type randomized (75:50 - 75:55)
um (75:54 - 75:57)
but also like I would it would have been (75:55 - 75:59)
the same thing of like if Pokemon's (75:57 - 76:00)
faster than you you like fail to run (75:59 - 76:02)
away sometimes (76:00 - 76:03)
um and I didn't have any polka dolls or (76:02 - 76:04)
I don't know if polka dolls are in the (76:03 - 76:06)
game (76:04 - 76:09)
uh poke toys right yeah the like toys or (76:06 - 76:12)
dolls but that was that was like really (76:09 - 76:14)
interesting to see (76:12 - 76:16)
um (76:14 - 76:18)
cool and then like the last thing is I (76:16 - 76:21)
did the picnics (76:18 - 76:23)
um 10 minute timer (76:21 - 76:26)
uh there is oh you know what's what was (76:23 - 76:28)
actually kind of crazy again I when I (76:26 - 76:32)
play I I there's I was like so happy and (76:28 - 76:35)
so I had so much like fun playing these (76:32 - 76:36)
games but when something weird happened (76:35 - 76:39)
I just thought of like these are the (76:36 - 76:42)
complaints I'm gonna hear in my twitch (76:39 - 76:43)
stream (76:42 - 76:45)
so when I got to the town where brassius (76:43 - 76:48)
was in there was um like there was like (76:45 - 76:51)
five buildings on each side and like you (76:48 - 76:53)
could tell you can go into a building (76:51 - 76:55)
because they put like a placemat on the (76:53 - 76:58)
floor so if there's a door with like no (76:55 - 76:59)
like welcome mat that door is just like (76:58 - 77:01)
locked (76:59 - 77:02)
um which is like normal in like (77:01 - 77:04)
literally every video game like some (77:02 - 77:05)
doors you just can't go into (77:04 - 77:07)
and if the door had a placemat you could (77:05 - 77:09)
go inside (77:07 - 77:13)
um so there was a place where I like (77:09 - 77:15)
went up to the door I opened it I went (77:13 - 77:16)
inside and there was like stuff inside (77:15 - 77:20)
and then there was like a place where it (77:16 - 77:21)
wasn't like a door it was like a window (77:20 - 77:24)
counter so the doormat was in front of (77:21 - 77:26)
the you could see the person and then (77:24 - 77:27)
you went up and you talked to the person (77:26 - 77:30)
and then it opened like a menu just like (77:27 - 77:32)
um in like sword and shield (77:30 - 77:33)
if you go inside the Pokemon Center (77:32 - 77:35)
there's the two people on the right hand (77:33 - 77:36)
side and then when you talk to them they (77:35 - 77:38)
open a menu and they're like here's (77:36 - 77:40)
everything you can buy so like one of (77:38 - 77:43)
the people they were like in a window (77:40 - 77:44)
um there's like a doormat in front of (77:43 - 77:45)
them you walk up and then they like they (77:44 - 77:47)
like sell you like strawberries or (77:45 - 77:49)
bananas or like whatever they're just (77:47 - 77:51)
selling you stuff for your sandwiches (77:49 - 77:53)
um and then there was another instance (77:51 - 77:54)
where I was like a door it was a door (77:53 - 77:57)
door and there's a mat inside and I like (77:54 - 78:00)
went and I walked in and when I opened (77:57 - 78:02)
the door it just presented me with a (78:00 - 78:05)
menu there was no inside of the building (78:02 - 78:08)
I opened the door into a menu and I I (78:05 - 78:10)
was supposed to go inside any of the (78:08 - 78:12)
buildings yeah they told you not to go (78:10 - 78:15)
there and I the thing I could think of (78:12 - 78:17)
is people are going to complain that (78:15 - 78:20)
they didn't animate the inside of this (78:17 - 78:21)
build like all it sold was sandwich (78:20 - 78:24)
stuff that's all it was right like like (78:21 - 78:26)
every store in this town just sold (78:24 - 78:28)
different sandwich stuff (78:26 - 78:29)
um like one sold like fruits and then (78:28 - 78:31)
one sold like meats and then one sold (78:29 - 78:33)
like vegetables and then one sold like (78:31 - 78:35)
sandwich picks like the thing like yeah (78:33 - 78:38)
because we all want fruit on a sandwich (78:35 - 78:40)
ah well I've had apples tomatoes on a (78:38 - 78:43)
chicken sandwich before I mean tomatoes (78:40 - 78:44)
fruit (78:43 - 78:45)
true (78:44 - 78:47)
so that was like a really weird thing to (78:45 - 78:49)
see of like opening a door to go inside (78:47 - 78:51)
a house but only getting presented with (78:49 - 78:53)
like a menu I like that menu look looked (78:51 - 78:55)
pretty like it wasn't just like a static (78:53 - 78:58)
like black like it was like animated and (78:55 - 78:59)
stuff (78:58 - 79:00)
um (78:59 - 79:03)
but I I bought like a bunch of bananas (79:00 - 79:05)
and strawberries I was just buying like (79:03 - 79:07)
everything and like the the Nintendo rep (79:05 - 79:08)
was like wow you're buying a lot of like (79:07 - 79:11)
strawberries and I was like what you (79:08 - 79:12)
gave me unlimited money like (79:11 - 79:16)
this lighter up and just buy it (79:12 - 79:19)
um and then I made the sandwich so the (79:16 - 79:22)
sandwich is is somebody (79:19 - 79:22)
um when I was talking to somebody else (79:23 - 79:25)
who played the game they like referred (79:24 - 79:28)
it to like a Lilo and Stitch mini game (79:25 - 79:30)
on the Game Boy Advance and I was like I (79:28 - 79:32)
have no clue what you're talking about (79:30 - 79:35)
but you you laid on your bread and then (79:32 - 79:38)
you can either bring in as much or as (79:35 - 79:40)
little ingredients as you want and if (79:38 - 79:43)
you if you bring in the max amount of (79:40 - 79:46)
ingredients you have to use it all (79:43 - 79:48)
so you can't like bring in like a (79:46 - 79:50)
million people you can't bring in like (79:48 - 79:51)
20 pieces of salami but then only use (79:50 - 79:54)
10. so so you're creating your own (79:51 - 79:56)
difficulty is ultimately what that is (79:54 - 79:59)
like if you don't think you can put it (79:56 - 80:02)
all on a sandwich then don't bring it so (79:59 - 80:04)
I was like you know what Max it out I'm (80:02 - 80:06)
gonna bring I brought but they were like (80:04 - 80:09)
they said it's a stacking mini game (80:06 - 80:11)
so like you have to stack it in a way (80:09 - 80:13)
where if things like fall off you get (80:11 - 80:14)
punished for it (80:13 - 80:18)
I was like great seven 700 IQ salami (80:14 - 80:21)
that's flap ham that's flat lettuce (80:18 - 80:24)
that's flat bananas flat and then the (80:21 - 80:25)
only thing that wasn't really like flat (80:24 - 80:27)
were like strawberries because they're (80:25 - 80:29)
like curved so that's what I that's what (80:27 - 80:31)
I brought in I brought in like a banana (80:29 - 80:33)
is not flat unless you mush it or cut it (80:31 - 80:35)
in hand no it's like the the circle like (80:33 - 80:36)
the the circles (80:35 - 80:38)
like what you would put in your series (80:36 - 80:41)
chips slices bananas (80:38 - 80:44)
so I I put down my salon my ham and then (80:41 - 80:46)
I put down my lettuce and nothing's (80:44 - 80:47)
falling off and then I put down my (80:46 - 80:49)
bananas and then nothing's falling off (80:47 - 80:50)
and then I'm putting my strawberries on (80:49 - 80:51)
and they're like some of them are like (80:50 - 80:53)
sliding off I like dropped two (80:51 - 80:54)
strawberries (80:53 - 80:56)
um out of like however many strawberries (80:54 - 80:59)
I brought so I something happened like (80:56 - 81:01)
something I I got negative something (80:59 - 81:02)
when they fell off because it made like (81:01 - 81:04)
a dude like it yelled at me like a (81:02 - 81:05)
strawberry fell off (81:04 - 81:07)
and then it gives you a star rating and (81:05 - 81:09)
I don't remember what I got I don't know (81:07 - 81:10)
if I got like a three or a five or four (81:09 - 81:12)
I don't really remember (81:10 - 81:15)
um but then it gave you like boost and I (81:12 - 81:17)
think I got like a grass type boost and (81:15 - 81:19)
she was and the Nintendo rep was like (81:17 - 81:21)
now it's easier to find like grass type (81:19 - 81:23)
Pokemon around you for a little bit (81:21 - 81:26)
because you got that boost which looks (81:23 - 81:27)
like sandwiches work in the real world (81:26 - 81:31)
yeah yeah absolutely uh so the the (81:27 - 81:34)
sandwich mini game (81:31 - 81:34)
I thought was more engaging than Curry (81:34 - 81:41)
and then poffins and I actually had a (81:38 - 81:42)
good time with it (81:41 - 81:43)
um and then you like put the little pick (81:42 - 81:45)
in (81:43 - 81:45)
um (81:45 - 81:50)
and overall I I think it was a huge like (81:45 - 81:53)
Improvement and even so the only reason (81:50 - 81:56)
you would make curry is to increase your (81:53 - 81:58)
Pokemon's happiness to like give your (81:56 - 82:01)
Pokemon like HP but I don't know why you (81:58 - 82:02)
would specifically do that when you (82:01 - 82:04)
could just fly to a Pokemon Center and (82:02 - 82:06)
that would be way quicker (82:04 - 82:07)
um (82:06 - 82:12)
uh HP happiness uh to Curry hunt if you (82:07 - 82:14)
wanted to attract a Pokemon which like (82:12 - 82:16)
literally no one did (82:14 - 82:19)
um and then that was like kind of it or (82:16 - 82:21)
to like complete your Curry decks with (82:19 - 82:22)
the sandwich stuff it feels like it does (82:21 - 82:24)
all that right like you you apparently (82:22 - 82:26)
you can get an egg although we didn't (82:24 - 82:27)
talk about that (82:26 - 82:29)
um you can increase your Pokemon's like (82:27 - 82:32)
health or happiness but then you also (82:29 - 82:33)
get those boosts (82:32 - 82:36)
so I would imagine if you're looking for (82:33 - 82:38)
like (82:36 - 82:39)
I don't know if crime rants in the game (82:38 - 82:41)
but uh like in sword and shield Kramer (82:39 - 82:43)
it only appears when it's like raining (82:41 - 82:45)
in the wild area (82:43 - 82:47)
um and even so it's only like a 15 spawn (82:45 - 82:51)
when it's raining so I I don't know if (82:47 - 82:52)
in this game if like oh I want to hunt (82:51 - 82:55)
cramerant cramerant's only gonna appear (82:52 - 82:56)
when it's raining (82:55 - 82:58)
but it's only 15 if I make the sandwich (82:56 - 83:01)
that increases water type spawns (82:58 - 83:02)
does that mean I see more crap I'm (83:01 - 83:05)
assuming that means I see more cramerant (83:02 - 83:08)
um so that would that sounds great for (83:05 - 83:12)
people who want to like shiny hunt or or (83:08 - 83:13)
you know just complete their Pokedex (83:12 - 83:15)
that sounds really great and they said (83:13 - 83:16)
there was other boost too like a more (83:15 - 83:19)
experienced boost (83:16 - 83:19)
um (83:19 - 83:22)
increased shiny rates boost (83:19 - 83:25)
I don't know uh they it was funny (83:22 - 83:26)
because the the guy at the Pokemon the (83:25 - 83:28)
company was like (83:26 - 83:30)
you don't have any questions about shiny (83:28 - 83:32)
hunting and I was like no because I know (83:30 - 83:33)
you guys don't have any answers and he (83:32 - 83:35)
laughed and he was like yeah everyone (83:33 - 83:36)
else asked about it and we told them we (83:35 - 83:38)
didn't know (83:36 - 83:38)
and I was like I was like what a bunch (83:39 - 83:44)
of amateurs over here why would they ask (83:42 - 83:46)
you about shiny hunting it took us three (83:44 - 83:48)
years to figure out shiny hunting and (83:46 - 83:51)
and sword and shield like I know you (83:48 - 83:54)
guys won't know how it works (83:51 - 83:54)
uh so yeah don't don't know about shiny (83:55 - 84:00)
hunting um (83:58 - 84:02)
I'm sure and here here the reality is (84:00 - 84:03)
you know people are going to try to (84:02 - 84:05)
shiny hunt off the bat (84:03 - 84:07)
data miners or whatever are going to (84:05 - 84:08)
tell you how to shine your hand it's (84:07 - 84:10)
gonna be wrong if whatever you know like (84:08 - 84:13)
I said it took us three years heck we (84:10 - 84:15)
literally just found out how to shiny (84:13 - 84:17)
honey let's go Pikachu let's go Eevee (84:15 - 84:19)
after sword and shield already came out (84:17 - 84:21)
like everyone was technically shiny (84:19 - 84:23)
hunting wrong that entire time and I did (84:21 - 84:24)
a video about that um (84:23 - 84:29)
so uh I I had zero expectations so for (84:24 - 84:31)
anyone who's like made it this far into (84:29 - 84:32)
the podcast or to the video and they're (84:31 - 84:34)
like you didn't ask about shiny hunting (84:32 - 84:38)
like look look at the track record here (84:34 - 84:38)
um we probably won't know for you know (84:38 - 84:43)
several months or we think we'll know (84:41 - 84:44)
and we'll do it and it'll kind of work (84:43 - 84:46)
and then we'll find out that you know (84:44 - 84:48)
there's a better way to do it (84:46 - 84:49)
um (84:48 - 84:51)
so yeah I hope I didn't sound super (84:49 - 84:53)
negative uh I'm sorry I start off with (84:51 - 84:55)
the gym stuff and that kind of sounded (84:53 - 84:57)
negative uh (84:55 - 84:59)
but I think because of the Titans I I it (84:57 - 85:01)
makes sense to me (84:59 - 85:03)
um and I think that like Legends (85:01 - 85:05)
catching Pokemon is probably going to be (85:03 - 85:07)
a bummer for other for people I (85:05 - 85:10)
understand that like totally (85:07 - 85:11)
um (85:10 - 85:16)
I I I cannot understate how (85:11 - 85:18)
incredibly excited I am for these games (85:16 - 85:21)
now that I'm playing it and like I said (85:18 - 85:24)
before and I'll say it again if if (85:21 - 85:27)
if you still have questions or go back (85:24 - 85:29)
and watch that 14 minute trailer after (85:27 - 85:31)
playing it that trailer pretty much is (85:29 - 85:34)
the expectations but that's I I guess (85:31 - 85:35)
that's another conversation like (85:34 - 85:38)
Nintendo and the Pokemon company they do (85:35 - 85:40)
really cherish and like to surprise (85:38 - 85:43)
their audiences and so like (85:40 - 85:45)
when they were like don't talk about (85:43 - 85:47)
like you can talk that you you can say (85:45 - 85:48)
that you battled mellow but don't talk (85:47 - 85:51)
about the battle in depth it was like (85:48 - 85:53)
I get why they don't want me to talk (85:51 - 85:54)
about it (85:53 - 85:56)
um because like out of that whole (85:54 - 85:57)
preview like that mellow thing still (85:56 - 85:59)
sticks with me as like (85:57 - 86:00)
honestly that mellow thing was probably (85:59 - 86:03)
the top moment by far nothing you were (86:00 - 86:06)
shook okay uh like I can't stop thinking (86:03 - 86:07)
about how cool that that whole (86:06 - 86:10)
interaction was (86:07 - 86:10)
um and you know the Titan thing they (86:10 - 86:13)
were like battle we want you to battle (86:12 - 86:15)
the Titan cool and then I did they were (86:13 - 86:16)
like do not Chase it and I was like (86:15 - 86:20)
what's over there so I get it uh I get (86:16 - 86:24)
that they want players to be surprised (86:20 - 86:26)
and I can see (86:24 - 86:28)
where those are (86:26 - 86:29)
um and you could look at sword and (86:28 - 86:31)
shield and you can be like these are the (86:29 - 86:32)
surprises in sword and shield right like (86:31 - 86:36)
whether or not they hit that's totally (86:32 - 86:39)
you know dependent on a player right (86:36 - 86:40)
um of what they're looking for to be (86:39 - 86:42)
surprised (86:40 - 86:43)
um but now you know now you know the (86:42 - 86:45)
catching stuff isn't in from Legend (86:43 - 86:47)
Arceus so at least you won't be (86:45 - 86:48)
negatively surprised when it comes out (86:47 - 86:51)
you will be disappointed now and then (86:48 - 86:54)
and then hopefully let it pass yeah (86:51 - 86:57)
uh but the movement felt great uh oh I (86:54 - 86:59)
went into the inventory I went into the (86:57 - 87:00)
bag (86:59 - 87:01)
um (87:00 - 87:03)
uh I don't know if there's marks or or (87:01 - 87:05)
ribbons I did check that it didn't (87:03 - 87:08)
obviously nothing had anything (87:05 - 87:11)
um the the uh the bag I couldn't tell if (87:08 - 87:13)
like if it was shiny if it would appear (87:11 - 87:14)
there again I didn't have any Shiny (87:13 - 87:16)
Pokemon so can't tell (87:14 - 87:18)
um it still had the same like (87:16 - 87:20)
star Diamond square triangle like the (87:18 - 87:24)
marking stuff was still there I did go (87:20 - 87:26)
into like the search (87:24 - 87:27)
where you could like search for like (87:26 - 87:29)
fire type or you could search for a (87:27 - 87:30)
Pokemon with like the move like Hyper (87:29 - 87:31)
Beam (87:30 - 87:35)
um there was no search for like shiny (87:31 - 87:37)
uh like there is in Pokemon home in (87:35 - 87:39)
Pokemon home you could search for shiny (87:37 - 87:41)
specifically that did not go yeah yeah (87:39 - 87:43)
and Pokemon go and in Pokemon home you (87:41 - 87:45)
could search for shiny there was none of (87:43 - 87:49)
that in the menu system that I saw in uh (87:45 - 87:52)
in scarlet and violet it was exactly the (87:49 - 87:54)
same Search terms that were in sword and (87:52 - 87:55)
shield (87:54 - 87:57)
um but also I don't think you could (87:55 - 88:00)
specifically search for shiny in (87:57 - 88:02)
Legends (88:00 - 88:03)
um I don't think there was a shiny (88:02 - 88:06)
search button (88:03 - 88:08)
um but there was also not an alpha (88:06 - 88:09)
search button in Legends which was (88:08 - 88:10)
actually kind of frustrating now that (88:09 - 88:13)
I'm think thinking about it (88:10 - 88:15)
uh so yeah (88:13 - 88:16)
um (88:15 - 88:19)
the the catching thing is traditional (88:16 - 88:20)
although it did seem to catch Pokemon a (88:19 - 88:22)
little bit faster (88:20 - 88:23)
uh (88:22 - 88:26)
it felt very like you know still shook (88:23 - 88:30)
twice broke out kind of thing (88:26 - 88:32)
uh there were quite a few new Pokemon I (88:30 - 88:33)
saw that I can't talk about there were (88:32 - 88:35)
probably returning Pokemon I saw that (88:33 - 88:36)
they said I wasn't allowed to talk about (88:35 - 88:38)
but honestly at this point they've (88:36 - 88:39)
showed so many returning Pokemon I don't (88:38 - 88:41)
know what's new and what I like I (88:39 - 88:42)
literally had to double check if Mark (88:41 - 88:46)
row was shown uh it was uh I saw a lot (88:42 - 88:49)
of Pokemon in an hour and the even the (88:46 - 88:51)
and if I didn't use the flying feature (88:49 - 88:54)
to get around the map I don't think I (88:51 - 88:55)
would have been able to walk from place (88:54 - 88:58)
to place and get everything done I I (88:55 - 89:00)
know I wouldn't but I had to have flown (88:58 - 89:02)
to get very close to things in order to (89:00 - 89:05)
complete them because uh (89:02 - 89:07)
I I will be the first to admit I am (89:05 - 89:10)
wrong and I've underestimated the size (89:07 - 89:14)
of this world it is so big (89:10 - 89:15)
um (89:14 - 89:17)
and I think in my opinion it will make (89:15 - 89:21)
Legends Arceus look like a tiny game (89:17 - 89:24)
uh the it the it's actually incredible (89:21 - 89:27)
of how big this map is so (89:24 - 89:30)
so was the train station to Kalos within (89:27 - 89:33)
the black quarter or outside wait where (89:30 - 89:35)
was it (89:33 - 89:39)
no no train station that I saw uh (89:35 - 89:42)
no uh I didn't interact with a lot oh (89:39 - 89:46)
another thing uh trainer battles do not (89:42 - 89:48)
happen line of sight (89:46 - 89:50)
you have to talk to them to initiate a (89:48 - 89:53)
trainer battle uh they they do exist in (89:50 - 89:55)
the world you know that was the thing we (89:53 - 89:57)
were talking about with Legends Arceus (89:55 - 89:58)
where like (89:57 - 90:00)
uh are there just gonna be trainers and (89:58 - 90:02)
are the trainers going to battle if it's (90:00 - 90:05)
open world like how is that gonna work (90:02 - 90:06)
um (90:05 - 90:08)
turns out there was no trainer battles (90:06 - 90:11)
in that game there was just like uh you (90:08 - 90:12)
know main character battles there was (90:11 - 90:14)
like seven of them I always make that (90:12 - 90:15)
joke that there's like seven battles in (90:14 - 90:17)
all of Legends Arceus although it's a (90:15 - 90:18)
true joke (90:17 - 90:20)
um there are trainers just standing (90:18 - 90:23)
around in this open world I did battle (90:20 - 90:24)
one of them just because I was curious (90:23 - 90:26)
they're just standing there (90:24 - 90:28)
um there was like an item near them I (90:26 - 90:29)
think it was like a TM that I picked up (90:28 - 90:31)
and then I walked over and I was like oh (90:29 - 90:33)
I bet this is like a trainer battle and (90:31 - 90:34)
I talked to them and they're like yeah (90:33 - 90:36)
let's battle they had two Pokemon I (90:34 - 90:38)
think one was like I (90:36 - 90:42)
um and then gosh they they were like (90:38 - 90:45)
level 17 and 18 like I don't think (90:42 - 90:47)
trainer battles would scale either right (90:45 - 90:49)
but yeah I don't know why they would (90:47 - 90:50)
that would seem like I don't know that (90:49 - 90:53)
seemed like a lot of work but yeah I I (90:50 - 90:55)
could imagine somebody you know going to (90:53 - 90:57)
a harder area not necessarily to do the (90:55 - 90:58)
gym leader but to explore and then get (90:57 - 91:02)
destroyed by a trainer uh which (90:58 - 91:03)
I don't know if that's a good thing or a (91:02 - 91:05)
bad thing right like do people (91:03 - 91:09)
want to lose to a random trainer battle (91:05 - 91:12)
I think that's possible in this game now (91:09 - 91:14)
uh but you would have to initiate it (91:12 - 91:17)
which I think feels better right like (91:14 - 91:19)
you could be in a hard area just to (91:17 - 91:22)
explore or to catch new Pokemon and be (91:19 - 91:24)
like I know if a trainer caught me I (91:22 - 91:25)
would lose (91:24 - 91:27)
but that situation you would have to (91:25 - 91:29)
initiate that so I like (91:27 - 91:31)
that was probably I think that's better (91:29 - 91:33)
I think that's a whole another (91:31 - 91:35)
conversation we don't have time for (91:33 - 91:37)
today to talk about like (91:35 - 91:39)
what's like (91:37 - 91:43)
is a force difficulty better or is like (91:39 - 91:45)
I know this area is going to be harder (91:43 - 91:48)
and I am choosing that experience kind (91:45 - 91:49)
of thing (91:48 - 91:51)
um (91:49 - 91:53)
but yeah that I know that for sure like (91:51 - 91:55)
the the Nintendo reps seemed very happy (91:53 - 91:57)
about that I think they explained it (91:55 - 91:59)
like (91:57 - 92:01)
this is a true open world and if I just (91:59 - 92:03)
want to go at my own pace and collect (92:01 - 92:05)
Pokemon or pick up items I don't have to (92:03 - 92:07)
worry about trainer battles that's how (92:05 - 92:09)
they framed it um (92:07 - 92:11)
which (92:09 - 92:12)
yeah (92:11 - 92:17)
uh yeah I can't argue with that (92:12 - 92:17)
um I look I played brilliant Diamond (92:17 - 92:22)
shining Pearl I wish I wasn't hit with a (92:19 - 92:24)
trainer battle every four steps you know (92:22 - 92:27)
that's just what that game was (92:24 - 92:27)
so yeah uh (92:27 - 92:31)
I only saw one trainer battle though (92:29 - 92:33)
um I didn't look too hard you know I I (92:31 - 92:35)
went down to the beach I saw a bunch of (92:33 - 92:38)
Wiglet I came up I saw some murkrow I I (92:35 - 92:40)
I saw a lot of the chunk (92:38 - 92:41)
[Music] (92:40 - 92:42)
um (92:41 - 92:45)
I ran over and saw some new Pokemon I (92:42 - 92:47)
got destroyed by one of those new (92:45 - 92:49)
Pokemon I went over I saw some more (92:47 - 92:51)
lechonk (92:49 - 92:53)
um (92:51 - 92:56)
I saw a lot of Pokemon in a very (92:53 - 92:59)
a lot of like returning Pokemon in a (92:56 - 93:01)
very short amount of time and like I (92:59 - 93:04)
said I I was very restricted on the map (93:01 - 93:06)
but even if I wanted to explore the (93:04 - 93:08)
whole area they gave me (93:06 - 93:09)
there's no way I could have done in an (93:08 - 93:12)
hour absolutely no way (93:09 - 93:14)
no way I could have done it without even (93:12 - 93:16)
like the only reason I was able to go as (93:14 - 93:17)
fast as I was is because a fast (93:16 - 93:18)
traveling because it could ride on if I (93:17 - 93:22)
was on foot holy cow like (93:18 - 93:23)
just (93:22 - 93:27)
the the I can't uh understate how big (93:23 - 93:31)
this world is which I I hope is exciting (93:27 - 93:34)
for people to hear (93:31 - 93:35)
um because I think a lot of people (93:34 - 93:37)
wanted Legends Arceus to be this true (93:35 - 93:39)
first open World (93:37 - 93:41)
um and they they said the Nintendo rep (93:39 - 93:43)
said multiple times this is our first (93:41 - 93:46)
open world Pokemon game and we're very (93:43 - 93:47)
proud that this is our first open world (93:46 - 93:49)
Pokemon game (93:47 - 93:50)
um (93:49 - 93:52)
and that's what that's what we said (93:50 - 93:54)
through all the marketing of Legends (93:52 - 93:56)
Arceus look if you had an open world (93:54 - 93:58)
game you let people know it's open world (93:56 - 94:01)
and you use that every time you can and (93:58 - 94:03)
they never did with blood Edmond Latin (94:01 - 94:05)
Legends isn't right like Legends is five (94:03 - 94:08)
areas that you can Traverse between (94:05 - 94:10)
um (94:08 - 94:13)
uh like I said uh glitch wise you know (94:10 - 94:14)
the frame rate was kind of like weird in (94:13 - 94:16)
certain areas (94:14 - 94:18)
um the lettuce at one point like like (94:16 - 94:19)
disappeared through the table through (94:18 - 94:20)
sandwich making which is like more (94:19 - 94:22)
laughable than anything (94:20 - 94:23)
um (94:22 - 94:25)
they they said multiple times this is (94:23 - 94:27)
not the final version of the game (94:25 - 94:29)
uh it seemed to run fine though (94:27 - 94:31)
um (94:29 - 94:33)
everything's good so (94:31 - 94:35)
that's all I got (94:33 - 94:37)
I don't know if that makes you guys more (94:35 - 94:39)
or less excited but that's that's all I (94:37 - 94:42)
got I'm at the same level same (94:39 - 94:44)
all right well if you're watching out of (94:42 - 94:46)
YouTube uh if you have any more (94:44 - 94:48)
questions if I can answer them uh like (94:46 - 94:50)
comment those questions subscribe and I (94:48 - 94:52)
will try to answer everything the best I (94:50 - 94:53)
can if I can't answer it I'll just say (94:52 - 94:55)
like hey Nintendo won't say it I can't (94:53 - 94:57)
talk about that cannot tell you what (94:55 - 95:00)
happens after the torkel and Mella (94:57 - 95:01)
um but yeah I'm probably missing stuff I (95:00 - 95:03)
probably rambled I'm super sorry (95:01 - 95:05)
hopefully you enjoyed this preview uh (95:03 - 95:07)
and if you're listening to the podcast (95:05 - 95:09)
version there will probably be something (95:07 - 95:10)
after this so we will be right back (95:09 - 95:13)
otherwise thanks for watching and (95:10 - 95:14)
