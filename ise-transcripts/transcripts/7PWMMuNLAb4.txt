this remember to mark your calendar or (7:46 - 7:54)
for the debut of Pokemon journey the (7:51 - 7:57)
series on June 12th I have a Qui Nhon (7:54 - 7:59)
I have many questions on Greg you can go (7:57 - 8:02)
first because you only have one are we (7:59 - 8:03)
supposed to know who walk off the earth (8:02 - 8:13)
is j-pop here's what was it it was the (8:03 - 8:15)
PR Giants or something I remember they (8:13 - 8:16)
didn't have a hit (8:15 - 8:19)
I remember they did a Pokemon song with (8:16 - 8:21)
we are Giants or whatever that band (8:19 - 8:22)
theme is made a big deal about it I want (8:21 - 8:24)
to say that was during oh I can wait I (8:22 - 8:28)
don't know they like to mention though I (8:24 - 8:29)
have no clue who walked the earth is I (8:28 - 8:31)
was I thought you guys are gonna know I (8:29 - 8:34)
thought the earth is a Canadian indie (8:31 - 8:37)
pop band from Burlington Ontario the (8:34 - 8:39)
group is known for its music videos of (8:37 - 8:42)
covers and originals the band is well (8:39 - 8:44)
known for covering pop genre music on (8:42 - 8:47)
YouTube making use of instruments such (8:44 - 8:50)
as the ukulele and the theremin as well (8:47 - 8:52)
as looping samples the picture they (8:50 - 8:54)
included of all of them playing one (8:52 - 8:57)
guitar has me so exhausted that I can't (8:54 - 9:04)
continue and I think you were thinking (8:57 - 9:07)
of the presidents of the United States (9:04 - 9:07)
an actual band people have actually (9:08 - 9:13)
heard of I think you're right I feel (9:11 - 9:16)
like they only mentioned this is this is (9:13 - 9:18)
a tin hat theory I feel like they only (9:16 - 9:20)
mentioned the band to make that one do (9:18 - 9:22)
who did the original Pokemon theme song (9:20 - 9:27)
stew in his hatred what is his name I (9:22 - 9:31)
care he was he was so wild at that polka (9:27 - 9:34)
caught he was so crabby Greg and I met (9:31 - 9:36)
him and you could just tell he was still (9:34 - 9:39)
jaded about what happened 20 years ago (9:36 - 9:42)
what was his name for those that you (9:39 - 9:45)
know and Jason Jason Jason something for (9:42 - 9:47)
those of you that don't know when the (9:45 - 9:49)
I'll give you the too long didn't read (9:47 - 9:51)
when the Pokemon company hired Jason (9:49 - 9:55)
whatever to do the Asian page jason page (9:51 - 9:58)
to do whatever the first theme song is (9:55 - 9:59)
called I don't know to be master or (9:58 - 10:01)
whatever gotta catch em all gotta catch (9:59 - 10:04)
ya whatever it is they paid him once and (10:01 - 10:06)
that was it that was part of his (10:04 - 10:07)
contract slash deal (10:06 - 10:09)
so because Pokemon blew up and became (10:07 - 10:12)
this huge sensation he doesn't get any (10:09 - 10:13)
royalties from when they use that song (10:12 - 10:16)
he gets nothing and you can tell that he (10:13 - 10:19)
I don't know maybe he's not maybe he's (10:16 - 10:22)
just had a bad day no he was he was (10:19 - 10:24)
having a bad weekend at that point but (10:22 - 10:27)
he was he seemed very jaded about not (10:24 - 10:31)
you know about life I guess yeah all (10:27 - 10:33)
right well your your many questions (10:31 - 10:38)
about listen yeah okay so just number (10:33 - 10:38)
one (10:38 - 10:41)
hope pokey Pokemon our in Japan right (10:38 - 10:44)
they have like a dedicated time slot (10:41 - 10:47)
where they show the Pokemon cartoon on (10:44 - 10:50)
Japanese television I'm a thank you very (10:47 - 10:52)
much yeah I do not use that word because (10:50 - 10:57)
I am speaking English okay well you you (10:52 - 10:59)
do understand that nobody's told Japan (10:57 - 11:03)
about streaming that's true Japan even (10:59 - 11:04)
is blown (11:03 - 11:06)
there's no Netflix in Japan okay okay (11:04 - 11:09)
that helps even though the other port (11:06 - 11:11)
every week talks about VPN ting into (11:09 - 11:13)
Japan so you can use Japanese Netflix (11:11 - 11:17)
but okay yeah but that's that's dark web (11:13 - 11:19)
stuff regular Japan doesn't know about (11:17 - 11:22)
dark web Netflix hacking from Leo (11:19 - 11:32)
Laporte yes noted known and noted so we (11:22 - 11:33)
don't know if they (11:32 - 11:37)
just because it used to be like big (11:33 - 11:38)
would get the episodes in Japan and then (11:37 - 11:40)
like a month later we got them here yeah (11:38 - 11:42)
no that's that's how it worked so (11:40 - 11:44)
they've already done 12 episodes in (11:42 - 11:46)
Japan and then we're just gonna get all (11:44 - 11:49)
12 dubbed they've done more than they've (11:46 - 11:51)
done more they twelve we have news (11:49 - 11:53)
regarding there's a delay on levels now (11:51 - 11:56)
well so I know for like the card fight (11:53 - 11:59)
Vanguard anime that there is a delay in (11:56 - 12:01)
those episodes coming out because of all (11:59 - 12:04)
the ability to record voice actors etc (12:01 - 12:07)
etc etc well I mean that was the primary (12:04 - 12:09)
source of all of my confusion and (12:07 - 12:12)
everything there but what what happened (12:09 - 12:16)
I thought they were like hand-in-hand (12:12 - 12:18)
with Disney now yeah well Disney's (12:16 - 12:21)
closing ranks and must own what they (12:18 - 12:24)
show so they are starting to get away (12:21 - 12:27)
from the regular Disney XD and stuff and (12:24 - 12:30)
switch just to Disney Plus which only (12:27 - 12:32)
are only have rights for what they own (12:30 - 12:36)
so I doubt Pokemon was like yeah sign (12:32 - 12:39)
everything over to Disney so but they (12:36 - 12:41)
used to have agreements with WB and (12:39 - 12:44)
Cartoon Network didn't they and they're (12:41 - 12:47)
gone can't but can it always was weird (12:44 - 12:52)
to me that Pokemon was on like WB in the (12:47 - 12:54)
morning or it was on what it was on (12:52 - 12:56)
afternoons and afternoon that's like (12:54 - 12:58)
primetime spot right if you're a cartoon (12:56 - 13:00)
being on at like 4:00 p.m. in the (12:58 - 13:02)
afternoon primetime cuz there's nothing (13:00 - 13:05)
on TV you just get off school you sit (13:02 - 13:07)
down you watch it let me think hold on (13:05 - 13:10)
it's three o'clock is Thundercats 3:30 (13:07 - 13:14)
is He Man 4 o'clock is GI Joe 4:30 is (13:10 - 13:18)
silver-eyed - there's no Silverhawks in (13:14 - 13:20)
my house it's transformers thank you (13:18 - 13:22)
very much Silverhawks came on at 5 (13:20 - 13:24)
o'clock when parents come home make you (13:22 - 13:26)
turn off the TV so that's where that car (13:24 - 13:29)
came with five (13:26 - 13:35)
my parents never came home but that was (13:29 - 13:37)
always you know the primetime spot spot (13:35 - 13:44)
is to be on non cable TV where ad (13:37 - 13:46)
revenue is at its highest because (13:44 - 13:49)
everyone has that once you add like a (13:46 - 13:52)
$70 a month subscription to channels and (13:49 - 13:54)
there's more competition commercial (13:52 - 13:57)
value goes down right so then eventually (13:54 - 14:01)
the Pokemon company sometimes they're a (13:57 - 14:03)
very cheap company maybe this is why (14:01 - 14:04)
they have so much buddy because they (14:03 - 14:07)
cheap out on stuff they got away from (14:04 - 14:08)
for kids they went with a cheaper (14:07 - 14:12)
production studio this is why the hoenn (14:08 - 14:14)
and the the the diamond and pearl anime (14:12 - 14:16)
it just looked like hot garbage I'm sure (14:14 - 14:19)
somebody's very fond of those animes and (14:16 - 14:21)
they were the special animes for them (14:19 - 14:22)
because they were 10 years old when (14:21 - 14:25)
those animes came out but animation wise (14:22 - 14:27)
they're bad (14:25 - 14:29)
I'm sure the stories are fine I haven't (14:27 - 14:31)
seen a lot of that anime specifically (14:29 - 14:35)
and then the big deal is when the (14:31 - 14:39)
Pokemon company decided to go all-in on (14:35 - 14:41)
Gen 5 and that was like the huge deal (14:39 - 14:43)
with you Nova that they signed to (14:41 - 14:45)
Cartoon Network and they're gonna be (14:43 - 14:47)
unlike the most popular cartoon channel (14:45 - 14:52)
on cable and in in retrospect as much as (14:47 - 14:57)
like Gen 5 was pretty vocally there was (14:52 - 14:59)
a lot of hate during Gen 5 and there was (14:57 - 15:01)
a lot of Mowgli loved by millions in (14:59 - 15:05)
millions I mean 5 sold well it's a good (15:01 - 15:09)
time but Gen 5 took so many like risks (15:05 - 15:11)
not only in game but the trading cards (15:09 - 15:14)
and the anime and like merchant like (15:11 - 15:16)
there's so much Gen 5 merch compared to (15:14 - 15:19)
like Gen 4 and I would even argue Gen 6 (15:16 - 15:21)
like they took so many chances with Gen (15:19 - 15:24)
5 and then it was a huge deal they were (15:21 - 15:26)
on Cartoon Network for two whole (15:24 - 15:29)
generations right cuz X&Y was also on (15:26 - 15:32)
Cartoon Network and then there was a (15:29 - 15:33)
huge deal that they signed to Disney (15:32 - 15:36)
which you could maybe argue that Disney (15:33 - 15:38)
was the Disney Channel's bigger if not (15:36 - 15:41)
better than Cartoon Network or became (15:38 - 15:43)
that over the years (15:41 - 15:47)
maybe Disney bought enough stuff to make (15:43 - 15:50)
themselves bigger sure it was always (15:47 - 15:51)
weird to me that they were like on (15:50 - 15:53)
Disney but you could just go to (15:51 - 15:56)
pokemon.com and watch almost I think you (15:53 - 15:58)
could still watch everything from Sun (15:56 - 16:00)
and Moon yep (15:58 - 16:02)
I don't think they maybe had a good (16:00 - 16:06)
relationship with Disney he otherwise or (16:02 - 16:08)
maybe Disney didn't like that they did (16:06 - 16:11)
that I mean they're clearly not big (16:08 - 16:15)
enough to just say watch Pokemon TV (16:11 - 16:18)
right I mean they they don't have their (16:15 - 16:20)
own way of streaming like that's just (16:18 - 16:21)
not gonna be a thing and it's not gonna (16:20 - 16:24)
get enough of eyes but in their own way (16:21 - 16:26)
of streaming it's called Pokemon TV it's (16:24 - 16:29)
yeah playing they don't have the storage (16:26 - 16:31)
to keep 50,000 I don't know if that's (16:29 - 16:35)
what I'm waiting to have oh yeah I don't (16:31 - 16:37)
know I don't know what but I mean we (16:35 - 16:39)
have to like we're ignoring the fact (16:37 - 16:43)
that Disney wants to own everything they (16:39 - 16:47)
show just that's what they're doing to (16:43 - 16:48)
be like oh they didn't have a good (16:47 - 16:52)
relationship well yeah that he wanted to (16:48 - 16:56)
own everything hey wait who who is (16:52 - 17:00)
opening the Nintendo theme park is that (16:56 - 17:02)
what Disney or was that with Universal (17:00 - 17:05)
Universal who who I don't know I'm (17:02 - 17:09)
asking I don't know Universal Universal (17:05 - 17:12)
Studios Japan cracks in the relationship (17:09 - 17:15)
begin to show Super Nintendo world (17:12 - 17:18)
yeah I guess maybe maybe their (17:15 - 17:22)
relationship with Disney went sour like (17:18 - 17:25)
Greg said I mean Disney clearly wants to (17:22 - 17:28)
own everything is it that like their (17:25 - 17:30)
relationship changed because Disney Plus (17:28 - 17:33)
launched yeah I mean when Disney Plus (17:30 - 17:37)
launched their own service and they (17:33 - 17:41)
moved away from focusing on the cable (17:37 - 17:45)
networks like I don't think anything new (17:41 - 17:48)
is coming to XD that's not automatically (17:45 - 17:50)
going on Disney Plus and so I think (17:48 - 17:54)
whereas the TV contracts are weird so (17:50 - 17:56)
sending it through the air way (17:54 - 17:58)
with ad revenue versus putting it on a (17:56 - 18:02)
paid subscription with no ads and like (17:58 - 18:05)
streaming rights are already just a (18:02 - 18:09)
bonkers new foreground so I'm sure like (18:05 - 18:11)
Pokemon company was fine we you know we (18:09 - 18:14)
give you rights to air it on TV but you (18:11 - 18:17)
don't have full rights to keep it on the (18:14 - 18:20)
streaming service yeah this is the part (18:17 - 18:23)
I don't understand like ideally the the (18:20 - 18:25)
anime is there 23 minutes a week (18:23 - 18:30)
commercial to buy plushies and to buy (18:25 - 18:32)
like you know trading cards and to get (18:30 - 18:35)
you hyped for the new games and but they (18:32 - 18:37)
didn't even like didn't want to fight (18:35 - 18:40)
for like primetime TV cuz like I mean if (18:37 - 18:41)
you look at something like WWE they made (18:40 - 18:44)
a huge deal of like we're off cable and (18:41 - 18:45)
we're going back to Fox like there's (18:44 - 18:48)
still a huge deal or maybe they made a (18:45 - 18:49)
huge deal and it's not a huge deal but I (18:48 - 18:51)
think it's still a huge deal to be like (18:49 - 18:54)
we were off cable we are now on free TV (18:51 - 18:58)
where we get better ad money and that is (18:54 - 18:59)
where we want to be as opposed to (18:58 - 19:01)
Netflix gave us a bunch of money to be (18:59 - 19:03)
on Netflix but we're now we're not (19:01 - 19:06)
getting ad money and now we have another (19:03 - 19:09)
barrier of entry which is yeah paid (19:06 - 19:12)
$11.99 I think for Netflix basically I (19:09 - 19:15)
pay much more than that it depends on (19:12 - 19:17)
the plan but yeah there's there's money (19:15 - 19:19)
there I gotta keep paying for that (19:17 - 19:25)
Totoro TV home just watch it don't watch (19:19 - 19:29)
it just return it that's what I do (19:25 - 19:30)
neither (19:29 - 19:34)
so network television is isn't doing (19:30 - 19:37)
great it's hard to do network television (19:34 - 19:42)
because nobody wants cable the way it is (19:37 - 19:45)
unless they can get on one of the big (19:42 - 19:46)
networks that you can get with an (19:45 - 19:50)
antenna which I don't know that there (19:46 - 19:53)
are any left that would run a lot of (19:50 - 19:55)
kids programming they have to go (19:53 - 19:58)
somewhere people will turn into WWE like (19:55 - 20:01)
that's a known quantity and a full (19:58 - 20:03)
broadcast stations like shared will take (20:01 - 20:05)
it will put up ads and you can get that (20:03 - 20:08)
channel with an antenna without having (20:05 - 20:10)
to pay for cable (20:08 - 20:13)
it's the Cable part like you have to (20:10 - 20:16)
have cable yeah and that's expensive (20:13 - 20:18)
whereas people there's a ton of people (20:16 - 20:20)
who aren't doing that anymore that (20:18 - 20:24)
that's that is just way too much money (20:20 - 20:28)
for nothing like you're getting a bunch (20:24 - 20:30)
of stuff you don't watch well I think (20:28 - 20:32)
I'm very true I think it's proven that (20:30 - 20:34)
like a show will get somebody to sign up (20:32 - 20:37)
like I signed up for Netflix I paid the (20:34 - 20:39)
money I paid the $12.99 because I wanted (20:37 - 20:42)
to watch that new me to movie and then (20:39 - 20:43)
of course I'm assuming that there's (20:42 - 20:46)
probably studies of like somebody signs (20:43 - 20:47)
up for your subscription for one thing (20:46 - 20:50)
and then they forget and then they then (20:47 - 20:52)
now they're month two and then they're (20:50 - 20:54)
like oh well I guess I'll watch it and (20:52 - 20:56)
then the secret of subscriptions that (20:54 - 21:00)
was discovered in like 18 but like the (20:56 - 21:02)
only reason I signed up for Disney Plus (21:00 - 21:05)
was because of the Simpsons because I (21:02 - 21:06)
want to watch that in repeat so I'm sure (21:05 - 21:09)
there are parents that are like I want (21:06 - 21:12)
my kids to watch Pokemon now I have an (21:09 - 21:13)
easy way from the watch Pokemon although (21:12 - 21:15)
this is only one season and twelve (21:13 - 21:16)
episodes to start with (21:15 - 21:19)
yeah but naturally every Simpsons (21:16 - 21:23)
episode on DVD already yeah I do but but (21:19 - 21:25)
I mean Netflix is really trying to do a (21:23 - 21:28)
big push to take over or compete with (21:25 - 21:31)
Disney on the child television front (21:28 - 21:33)
yeah like they're doing a lot and (21:31 - 21:35)
they're putting out a lot of their own (21:33 - 21:39)
programming plus a lot more so they're (21:35 - 21:42)
really trying to be the Disney (21:39 - 21:45)
alternative or secondary or whatever (21:42 - 21:47)
like I have them both because I want to (21:45 - 21:49)
watch all the Star Wars stuff on Disney (21:47 - 21:53)
but like pokemons a big kids programming (21:49 - 21:55)
thing it's like (21:53 - 21:56)
it's also for nectar say hey we have (21:55 - 21:58)
Pokemon so why don't you also consider (21:56 - 22:01)
bringing your child's entertainment over (21:58 - 22:04)
here yeah it's it's like it's a good is (22:01 - 22:08)
a good cornerstone to have and how crazy (22:04 - 22:10)
controlling Disney is I'm sure it was (22:08 - 22:12)
easy to take away from them I was in a (22:10 - 22:14)
lot of tech podcast and they they talk a (22:12 - 22:19)
lot about Netflix Disney Plus what's (22:14 - 22:20)
that quick quippy whatever that new one (22:19 - 22:25)
is kwibi quickly HBO man Chi Kok hasn't (22:20 - 22:26)
launched yet but it will be launching (22:25 - 22:31)
soon this is off a BG our Netflix is (22:26 - 22:33)
going to spend more than seventeen (22:31 - 22:36)
billion dollars on original content in (22:33 - 22:38)
2020 with Disney plus an Apple TV Plus (22:36 - 22:44)
Apple TV plus another TV service well of (22:38 - 22:46)
having made their debuts and peacock HBO (22:44 - 22:49)
Max and others slated to launch in the (22:46 - 22:50)
coming months this is a this is in (22:49 - 22:52)
January by the way so some of those did (22:50 - 22:54)
launch you might wave wondering if (22:52 - 22:55)
Netflix will stay on top much longer (22:54 - 22:57)
that's hard to imagine anyone stealing (22:55 - 22:58)
Netflix is crowned as the company spends (22:57 - 23:01)
17.3 billion on original content (22:58 - 23:04)
 says the majority of Netflix 2020 (23:01 - 23:06)
budget will be allocated to original (23:04 - 23:08)
programming so I want to go back to the (23:06 - 23:10)
pokemon.com article which says that (23:08 - 23:14)
Pokemon the series journey will be an (23:10 - 23:16)
original program to Netflix so this is (23:14 - 23:17)
part of their seventeen point three (23:16 - 23:19)
billion billion dollar budget (23:17 - 23:21)
 says that the majority of Netflix (23:19 - 23:23)
budget will be allocated towards (23:21 - 23:24)
original programming such as the (23:23 - 23:27)
animated originals that it will produce (23:24 - 23:29)
alongside Nickelodeon and the multi-year (23:27 - 23:31)
deal that it made with game of Game of (23:29 - 23:34)
Thrones showrunner David Benioff and Dan (23:31 - 23:36)
Weiss and the deals that it made with (23:34 - 23:38)
South Korean content makers which make (23:36 - 23:41)
which believes is a stepping stone (23:38 - 23:44)
to scaling in one of Asia's wealthiest (23:41 - 23:46)
and most and largest addressable markets (23:44 - 23:50)
as for comparison to other streaming (23:46 - 23:51)
services (23:50 - 23:53)
none can come close to matching Netflix (23:51 - 23:55)
budget variety notes that Disney only (23:53 - 23:58)
plans on setting spending 1 billion on (23:55 - 24:00)
original content for Disney Plus in 2020 (23:58 - 24:03)
while another 1 billion was spent at be (24:00 - 24:05)
spent on operating expenses meanwhile (24:03 - 24:09)
AT&T has a earmarked around to Billy (24:05 - 24:11)
dollars for HBO Max and NBCUniversal (24:09 - 24:14)
claims that they set aside the same (24:11 - 24:16)
amount for the first two years of (24:14 - 24:18)
peacock combined all three of those (24:16 - 24:19)
budgets and you're still not anywhere (24:18 - 24:21)
close to Netflix is seventeen point (24:19 - 24:22)
three billion dollars that they will (24:21 - 24:25)
spend this year my response to that is (24:22 - 24:26)
number one (24:25 - 24:28)
I sincerely hope that we are going to (24:26 - 24:31)
get South Korean soap operas because (24:28 - 24:33)
those are the greatest things ever of (24:31 - 24:36)
all time if I could get be strong come (24:33 - 24:40)
soon in English I would be thrilled (24:36 - 24:40)
beyond belief (24:40 - 24:43)
ah number two Disney doesn't have to (24:40 - 24:45)
spend seventeen billion because they (24:43 - 24:47)
literally have a hundred years of (24:45 - 24:50)
content videos throw up on to their (24:47 - 24:55)
service and it's we already got it the (24:50 - 24:57)
market share that they're fighting for (24:55 - 25:00)
is very small like the majority of (24:57 - 25:02)
consumers don't want to pay more than (25:00 - 25:05)
twenty month twenty dollars a month for (25:02 - 25:07)
all of their streaming services and (25:05 - 25:10)
that's not a lot like it netflix like uh (25:07 - 25:11)
sweet spot (25:10 - 25:13)
you're right fix comes in it like 13 (25:11 - 25:15)
bucks there's not a lot left after that (25:13 - 25:17)
for what people are willing to pay for (25:15 - 25:21)
every one of these is fighting to to (25:17 - 25:23)
knock somebody out of that twenty dollar (25:21 - 25:26)
bucket but you need new content to keep (25:23 - 25:28)
people subscribed you do at a certain (25:26 - 25:30)
point there's only so many times well (25:28 - 25:32)
unless you have like a six-year-old in (25:30 - 25:33)
the house and they want to watch Toy (25:32 - 25:36)
Story every day do you pay like do you (25:33 - 25:38)
pay how much does Disney plus eleven (25:36 - 25:40)
ninety nine six ninety nine ninety nine (25:38 - 25:43)
do you pay six ninety-nine a month for a (25:40 - 25:46)
year so that's like what like seventy (25:43 - 25:47)
two dollars do you pay seventy two (25:46 - 25:49)
dollars a year for your kid to watch Toy (25:47 - 25:51)
Story 4 or do you just go to Target and (25:49 - 25:52)
you buy toys three four four fifteen (25:51 - 25:54)
bucks and then you just have it on like (25:52 - 25:56)
like they're like there's only so much (25:54 - 25:59)
that and play it on what and play it on (25:56 - 26:02)
your ps4 your that's what like that's (25:59 - 26:06)
not a lot of people what really reason (26:02 - 26:08)
about DVDs they still make DVDs is (26:06 - 26:10)
because of like minivans and road trips (26:08 - 26:12)
and everything like yeah but that's yeah (26:10 - 26:15)
about in your car all day I mean what (26:12 - 26:18)
we're talking about is in particular (26:15 - 26:22)
dizzy launched their entire what (26:18 - 26:26)
hundred year catalog like they are oh (26:22 - 26:30)
did I do the entire catalog well they (26:26 - 26:32)
kept it that we know they kept a few few (26:30 - 26:36)
sketchy things hidden hmm but therefore (26:32 - 26:39)
a lot of this generation was streaming (26:36 - 26:42)
most of that content from the 60s and (26:39 - 26:45)
70s as is brand-new when they launched (26:42 - 26:48)
with their huge library it felt like you (26:45 - 26:51)
were getting hundreds and hundreds and (26:48 - 26:53)
hours of new content because you've (26:51 - 26:54)
never seen it before (26:53 - 26:57)
is it good content well that's up to you (26:54 - 26:59)
I saw the Fox in the Hound in the (26:57 - 27:03)
theater I enjoyed yeah it's but Disney (26:59 - 27:06)
doesn't have to ramp up more than they (27:03 - 27:08)
already are because every movie that (27:06 - 27:11)
they're producing automatically comes to (27:08 - 27:15)
their service every spin-off TV series (27:11 - 27:17)
that they make off of every superhero (27:15 - 27:19)
movie and they make one every year (27:17 - 27:21)
immediately comes to their service (27:19 - 27:23)
Disney doesn't have to spend as much (27:21 - 27:27)
money because Disney already owns so (27:23 - 27:28)
many properties they're sort of (27:27 - 27:31)
neglecting the fact that Netflix doesn't (27:28 - 27:34)
own anything and hasn't didn't come to (27:31 - 27:37)
the foreground producing anything well (27:34 - 27:39)
they are there they own like house of (27:37 - 27:41)
cards and they own like well they they (27:39 - 27:43)
own a very small amount of things that (27:41 - 27:45)
they only stir ative lee right right I (27:43 - 27:47)
started married recently (27:45 - 27:50)
so Netflix has to spend that much money (27:47 - 27:53)
to compete with things like HBO that's (27:50 - 27:54)
been running since the 80s (27:53 - 27:57)
Disney that's been running since the 20s (27:54 - 28:01)
to even come close to having that (27:57 - 28:03)
breadth of library that they call their (28:01 - 28:06)
own it will it be new and some of that (28:03 - 28:08)
stuff and ethics gonna make good sure is (28:06 - 28:12)
I'm gonna be a real bad you bet (28:08 - 28:16)
like couple of their teeth teen moms (28:12 - 28:19)
that are pretty awful like they're not (28:16 - 28:21)
the Hat they're spending the money (28:19 - 28:24)
because they have to and it's why it's (28:21 - 28:26)
sort of like this Wild Thing like look (28:24 - 28:27)
at how much money they're gonna spend (28:26 - 28:31)
they're the ones to watch it's more look (28:27 - 28:33)
at how much money they have to spend (28:31 - 28:36)
just try to stay competitive (28:33 - 28:39)
nabob Netflix isn't a good spot when (28:36 - 28:41)
everybody decided to pull everything out (28:39 - 28:44)
into their own service like they relied (28:41 - 28:47)
on every other company to give them (28:44 - 28:49)
things for people to watch and when (28:47 - 28:51)
everybody said or we could just make our (28:49 - 28:54)
own money Netflix is scrambling and has (28:51 - 28:57)
been scrambling for a year yes yeah but (28:54 - 29:00)
they're still number one well how do you (28:57 - 29:02)
count number one how do you count you (29:00 - 29:03)
count how many people are paying you (29:02 - 29:05)
they have a hundred and sixty by (29:03 - 29:07)
millions like grabbers that's the long (29:05 - 29:09)
tail of people who forgot to cancel (29:07 - 29:14)
their subscriptions they're still (29:09 - 29:15)
producing content that people are (29:14 - 29:17)
talking about house of cards yeah boring (29:15 - 29:20)
you know all the drama was was very very (29:17 - 29:21)
talked about you know stranger things is (29:20 - 29:24)
the way you think about it is anytime (29:21 - 29:26)
that Netflix wants to do something it's (29:24 - 29:29)
it's a risk it's like we're gonna (29:26 - 29:30)
produce this thing and we hope people (29:29 - 29:33)
like it but since it's never been seen (29:30 - 29:36)
before it's it's you know people might (29:33 - 29:37)
not like it it might it's just (29:36 - 29:40)
absolutely a risk and then Disney is (29:37 - 29:42)
like well you know what we're just gonna (29:40 - 29:43)
put the entire catalog of Hannah Montana (29:42 - 29:48)
out there and everybody's like heck yeah (29:43 - 29:48)
watch reruns of Hannah Montana I mean (29:49 - 29:55)
like somebody who's like 20 years (29:55 - 30:00)
younger than me 25 years younger than me (29:57 - 30:02)
sure that's like that's their childhood (30:00 - 30:04)
they walk back I used to watch friggin (30:02 - 30:10)
Gilligan's Island yeah Netflix is also (30:04 - 30:13)
the most expensive if anybody else can (30:10 - 30:16)
offer as much for cheaper people are (30:13 - 30:18)
going to jump and they have like they (30:16 - 30:21)
know that Disney Plus is a threat they (30:18 - 30:25)
know this they lost a lot to Disney they (30:21 - 30:26)
know that NBC is a threat they lost (30:25 - 30:29)
friends and as awful as that show is now (30:26 - 30:33)
people were very upset well they pulled (30:29 - 30:35)
it into their own house Netflix is (30:33 - 30:37)
scrambling to be the most expensive (30:35 - 30:40)
service out there while losing the stuff (30:37 - 30:42)
people wanted to watch (30:40 - 30:43)
yeah there's no there's no doubt that (30:42 - 30:45)
they're losing stuff so Netflix has a (30:43 - 30:47)
couple advantages there's still the (30:45 - 30:50)
biggest service that 167 million people (30:47 - 30:52)
our worldwide which other services are (30:50 - 30:54)
not there content includes Netflix (30:52 - 30:56)
originals which will be the new Pokemon (30:54 - 30:59)
anime studio ghibli except if you're in (30:56 - 31:01)
Canada u.s. and Japan you can't watch to (30:59 - 31:03)
do a Ghibli and then they have exclusive (31:01 - 31:06)
anime shows Amazon is number 2 they have (31:03 - 31:08)
a hundred million subscribers that's (31:06 - 31:10)
tied in with oh that's bonus that is (31:08 - 31:13)
bogus bogus I pay Amazon Prime because I (31:10 - 31:17)
forget to cancel it every year I'm not a (31:13 - 31:17)
subscriber (31:17 - 31:20)
they do have a hundred million people (31:17 - 31:22)
signed of all 100 million people signed (31:20 - 31:25)
up for Amazon Prime they are worldwide (31:22 - 31:26)
as well they have Amazon Studios they're (31:25 - 31:28)
producing their own TV shows like (31:26 - 31:30)
Netflix they have the Discovery Channel (31:28 - 31:32)
and they have ai TV I don't know what a (31:30 - 31:37)
TV is so Hulu has 30 million subscribers (31:32 - 31:40)
compared to a Netflix is 167 million (31:37 - 31:44)
they have NBC ABC fox a and E big 10 (31:40 - 31:45)
Bravo (31:44 - 31:50)
E PBS oxygen more Fox stuff sci fi USA (31:45 - 31:53)
and they're only available so who was (31:50 - 31:54)
only available in the US and Japan and (31:53 - 31:56)
then Disney Plus has 50 million (31:54 - 31:58)
subscribers which is Disney Marvel Star (31:56 - 32:01)
Wars Pixar National Geographic and 20th (31:58 - 32:03)
century Studios which I believe is (32:01 - 32:07)
citizens Disney owns the majority share (32:03 - 32:09)
in Hulu right yes everybody else pulled (32:07 - 32:14)
out so like Disney owns Hulu and Disney (32:09 - 32:16)
plus and so Disney has the disadvantage (32:14 - 32:19)
and Hulu has the disadvantage not being (32:16 - 32:21)
worldwide so they're only available in (32:19 - 32:23)
United States Canada Netherlands (32:21 - 32:26)
Australia New Zealand Austria Germany (32:23 - 32:29)
Ireland Italy Spain Switzerland and the (32:26 - 32:31)
United Kingdom so that's not a lot of (32:29 - 32:32)
countries they have something called (32:31 - 32:35)
Disney Plus hot star which has 300 (32:32 - 32:38)
million people which is star India HBO (32:35 - 32:41)
Showtime that's specifically available (32:38 - 32:44)

ESPN Plus which has 3.5 million users (32:44 - 32:48)
which has UFC that's only available in (32:46 - 32:50)
the United States and then you have CBS (32:48 - 32:53)
all access which has 10 million users at (32:50 - 32:56)
CBS and paramount not worldwide HBO now (32:53 - 33:00)
has 8 million users which is HBO stuff (32:56 - 33:03)
Universal Pictures Warner Brothers 20th (33:00 - 33:03)
century (33:03 - 33:05)
it's only available in the United States (33:03 - 33:07)
HBO max hasn't launched yet peacock (33:05 - 33:09)
hasn't launched yet but that's NBC (33:07 - 33:12)
Universal DreamWorks Animation Telemundo (33:09 - 33:15)
I know all our Spanish listeners (33:12 - 33:18)
Telemundo come into peacock that'll (33:15 - 33:21)
that'll save that Jim I would subscribe (33:18 - 33:23)
to that I can watch sabado gigante so (33:21 - 33:27)
don't even scoff at that YouTube premium (33:23 - 33:30)
that's a thing they got 20 million users (33:27 - 33:32)
also worldwide do they have YouTube (33:30 - 33:34)
originals apparently I don't know what (33:32 - 33:37)
any of those are Apple TV plus has 10 (33:34 - 33:39)
million users they have only just quotes (33:37 - 33:43)
original content once again just because (33:39 - 33:45)
I bought an Apple product does not make (33:43 - 33:47)
me a subscriber (33:45 - 33:50)
crunchyroll has 2 million users and when (33:47 - 33:52)
when when it's crunch you're all getting (33:50 - 33:55)
bought by either Disney Plus or Hulu or (33:52 - 33:57)
Netflix like I feel like that's coming (33:55 - 34:02)
it is owned by somebody that I am (33:57 - 34:04)
intimately familiar with well that's (34:02 - 34:07)
also like that's like such a fit because (34:04 - 34:11)
like I will watch crunchyroll without (34:07 - 34:13)
paying for it I mean I do that horrible (34:11 - 34:16)
ads if crunchyroll does anime and manga (34:13 - 34:20)
and whatnot why wouldn't they just put (34:16 - 34:22)
Pokemon on crunchyroll but I don't think (34:20 - 34:24)
crunchyroll could pay what the Pokemon (34:22 - 34:27)
company would probably want in rights to (34:24 - 34:30)
their show I think you're right besides (34:27 - 34:32)
Netflix being number one Disney Disney (34:30 - 34:36)
is what the Pokemon company walked away (34:32 - 34:38)
from there I don't know how do you how (34:36 - 34:40)
are you on Disney for three seasons and (34:38 - 34:41)
then you're like all right I'm we're (34:40 - 34:43)
done we're out like it was either money (34:41 - 34:45)
or they're just having happy with this (34:43 - 34:47)
near Disney load bottom on content I (34:45 - 34:48)
mean I've heard that from people where (34:47 - 34:51)
Disney thinks that because they are (34:48 - 34:54)
Disney they can lowball people they love (34:51 - 34:57)
all everybody that they do since this is (34:54 - 34:58)
public knowledge because I've looked it (34:57 - 34:58)
up (34:58 - 35:01)
crunchyroll is owned by AT&T and Warner (34:58 - 35:06)
Media oh ok so there's a reason (35:01 - 35:10)
crunchyroll is owned by Warner Media (35:06 - 35:13)
who's owned by AT&T so the reason why (35:10 - 35:15)
they don't have those things and there's (35:13 - 35:17)
a lot of sort of behind (35:15 - 35:18)
the scene stuff happening with (35:17 - 35:22)
crunchyroll and vrv is because HBO max (35:18 - 35:26)
and AT&T now are things and there's a (35:22 - 35:28)
lot of questions about what's happening (35:26 - 35:30)
with crunchyroll as part of all of that (35:28 - 35:32)
but 18t and warner media owned (35:30 - 35:37)
crunchyroll just an FYI so this is off (35:32 - 35:41)
this lot the LA Times this was September (35:37 - 35:46)
16 2019 so Netflix paid 500 million for (35:41 - 35:50)
the office and Warner Media paid 425 (35:46 - 35:54)
million for friends Netflix did make a (35:50 - 35:56)
huge deal about getting Seinfeld (35:54 - 35:58)
although I don't see the prices here but (35:56 - 36:01)
then Hulu paid for the exclusive rights (35:58 - 36:02)
for Seinfeld which was a hundred and (36:01 - 36:04)
thirty million for a six-year deal which (36:02 - 36:07)
expires next year so I guess that's (36:04 - 36:09)
either Gary signing wasn't that an NBC (36:07 - 36:12)
product though Seinfeld Seinfeld yeah (36:09 - 36:15)
definitely so there's no way peacocks (36:12 - 36:17)
not gonna take that back yeah oh I'm (36:15 - 36:19)
sure Pete I like Pete well duh but the (36:17 - 36:20)
whole thing about peacock is they were (36:19 - 36:22)
going to be the exclusive streaming (36:20 - 36:24)
service of the Olympics and then the (36:22 - 36:27)
Olympics got delayed so if this if (36:24 - 36:29)
Seinfeld ends in 2021 (36:27 - 36:31)
they are taking it back peacock will (36:29 - 36:33)
take it back and then they will make a (36:31 - 36:35)
huge deal about how Seinfeld is on (36:33 - 36:37)
peacock and the Olympics is on peacock (36:35 - 36:39)
and this is why you should sign up for (36:37 - 36:42)
peacock give us our portion every $20 a (36:39 - 36:47)
month I feel I know I pale I got a check (36:42 - 36:49)
by streaming service I just got a (36:47 - 36:52)
message that my CBS all access resub (36:49 - 36:53)
after they said they weren't going to (36:52 - 36:56)
and I cancelled it immediately the other (36:53 - 36:58)
question is we already know that Netflix (36:56 - 37:03)
gets really unsettling set after two (36:58 - 37:05)
seasons of a show and loves to cancel (37:03 - 37:08)
things so are they going to be upset if (37:05 - 37:10)
Pokemon doesn't bring in whatever market (37:08 - 37:12)
they want because Netflix this whole (37:10 - 37:15)
thing is they want shows that make new (37:12 - 37:17)
people sign up and if that show stops (37:15 - 37:19)
making new people sign up then they (37:17 - 37:21)
usually ax the show so is this only (37:19 - 37:23)
going to be like a short-term two-year (37:21 - 37:25)
deal before Netflix is like oh we don't (37:23 - 37:26)
want it or is like the Pokemon company (37:25 - 37:28)
being like we're making our own (37:26 - 37:31)
streaming service yeah and we need two (37:28 - 37:32)
years of buffers so let's at least sit (37:31 - 37:34)
on Netflix for two years if Netflix (37:32 - 37:36)
dumps it after two years like every (37:34 - 37:39)
other station has dumped Pokemon after (37:36 - 37:42)
two years like everybody's done it yeah (37:39 - 37:44)
then they're used to it so they'll just (37:42 - 37:47)
have to find somewhere new whoever wants (37:44 - 37:49)
to take them yeah maybe a Disney dump (37:47 - 37:50)
Pokemon maybe Pokemon didn't walk away (37:49 - 37:52)
from Disney maybe Disney was like you (37:50 - 37:53)
know what we don't want you anymore (37:52 - 37:56)
it could be maybe in two years Pokemon (37:53 - 37:57)
company was really happy and maybe (37:56 - 38:00)
Netflix was really happy with the Mewtwo (37:57 - 38:02)
movie probably I mean they've had a lot (38:00 - 38:04)
of I think they've been having some (38:02 - 38:05)
success because there's a bunch of (38:04 - 38:08)
Pokemon stuff already on Netflix and I'm (38:05 - 38:11)
sure they've seen success from that okay (38:08 - 38:13)
that was exciting news though (38:11 - 38:14)
I guess I'm keeping my Netflix (38:13 - 38:18)
subscription yeah I was gonna cancel it (38:14 - 38:21)
after I saw the Mewtwo movie but not now (38:18 - 38:23)
not now I guess it's now it's now (38:21 - 38:30)
considered a business all right look (38:23 - 38:32)
we're gonna take a quick break when we (38:30 - 38:34)

Japan as a result new episodes are (40:21 - 40:26)
delayed and channels will re-air old (40:24 - 40:29)
episodes starting next week the staff (40:26 - 40:32)
rule will reveal a later date when the (40:29 - 40:34)
anime will return the show premiered on (40:32 - 40:37)
TV Tokyo and its affiliates on November (40:34 - 40:40)
17th two days after the Pokemon a sword (40:37 - 40:43)
and shield games shipped worldwide the (40:40 - 40:46)
series was airing Sundays at 6 p.m. the (40:43 - 40:48)
same timeslot that was in Sun and Moon (40:46 - 40:51)
this is like the first time the anime is (40:48 - 40:52)
like not been on the air this will be (40:51 - 40:54)
the longest I think the anime will not (40:52 - 40:59)
be on air because of a situation yeah I (40:54 - 41:01)
mean this is no surprise as I said the (40:59 - 41:06)
card fight Vanguard annum mm cartoon is (41:01 - 41:11)
also delayed because they can't get the (41:06 - 41:13)
voice actors into studios but but we (41:11 - 41:17)
know what I find interesting and you may (41:13 - 41:19)
double-check me on this Greg because I (41:17 - 41:22)
Steve Scott no clue (41:19 - 41:26)
I believe that my hero academia voice (41:22 - 41:29)
actors are actually recording in their (41:26 - 41:33)
homes for an English dub yes I believe (41:29 - 41:37)
they are but I will say this it is I (41:33 - 41:40)
don't know Sandra practices I run for a (41:37 - 41:43)
lot of people but a lot of when a show (41:40 - 41:45)
is first starting they make everybody (41:43 - 41:49)
come into a recording studio and then (41:45 - 41:53)
once the it's established and these they (41:49 - 41:54)
can trust these people (41:53 - 41:56)
then they allow them if that person has (41:54 - 41:59)
recording to be at home to go home and (41:56 - 42:04)
do it so it is very pop my hero is (41:59 - 42:07)
clearly popular across multiple (42:04 - 42:10)
platforms the double is good so I'm sure (42:07 - 42:13)
they have more flexibility to work from (42:10 - 42:14)
hope that they're allowing them to work (42:13 - 42:17)
from home I don't know what pokemons (42:14 - 42:19)
issue is coz what these people have been (42:17 - 42:20)
doing it for years but they may not have (42:19 - 42:22)
they may not have good studios at home (42:20 - 42:25)
but there's that but I mean this is the (42:22 - 42:27)
also the original Japanese recording (42:25 - 42:30)
right not right dub not a translation (42:27 - 42:34)
and the the issue with recording from (42:30 - 42:37)
home is that you don't have a director (42:34 - 42:39)
who can like say which take you know (42:37 - 42:41)
they prefer right you're kind of doing (42:39 - 42:44)
it on your own you're doing but you tend (42:41 - 42:46)
to do multiple takes and send them in (42:44 - 42:51)
okay the zoom call in Japan nobody told (42:46 - 42:53)
you pan but zoom look I have tried to (42:51 - 42:58)
record audio from zoom a discord is (42:53 - 42:58)
better (42:58 - 43:02)
it's like recording off of zoom is the (42:58 - 43:05)
worst experience I've ever had it's it's (43:02 - 43:09)
tough because we have decent recording (43:05 - 43:11)
equipment nothing what's needed for (43:09 - 43:13)
professionals there's a level of (43:11 - 43:15)
soundproof like there's so many things (43:13 - 43:17)
that have to go into being able to do (43:15 - 43:21)
this professionally at home that I don't (43:17 - 43:22)
know how they do it a lot of them aren't (43:21 - 43:23)
like I love them just don't have the (43:22 - 43:27)
space or have well they're not a guard (43:23 - 43:30)
level right so they just don't know how (43:27 - 43:33)
like arrests they have their precious (43:30 - 43:35)
hand holders and keepers you guide them (43:33 - 43:38)
to a chair to sit and yack into a (43:35 - 43:40)
microphone for a few hours they just (43:38 - 43:42)
they're lost I'm also I don't know how (43:40 - 43:47)
much the animation happens after the (43:42 - 43:51)
recording because it's so much dude so (43:47 - 43:52)
many people do it where they have the (43:51 - 43:54)
people read the lines and then the (43:52 - 43:56)
animators match the mouths to the (43:54 - 43:58)
performances yeah that's part of the (43:56 - 44:02)
original Japanese part of it yes I so (43:58 - 44:04)
agree so yeah and also they don't want a (44:02 - 44:06)
bunch of people coming into an animation (44:04 - 44:10)
studio right congregating there right so (44:06 - 44:12)
like I doubt they have animators working (44:10 - 44:14)
and they're gonna make their voice (44:12 - 44:17)
actors match the mouth shapes like well (44:14 - 44:19)
but but also added and it professional (44:17 - 44:22)
animation is not a work from home no it (44:19 - 44:23)
is not a deal you you need some (44:22 - 44:26)
high-powered rendering type computers (44:23 - 44:28)
never I mean I well actually I could be (44:26 - 44:30)
completely wrong I've never tried to (44:28 - 44:32)
animate it okay that I imagined I (44:30 - 44:33)
thought that macbook air started (44:32 - 44:38)
rendering out some animation I having a (44:33 - 44:40)
MacBook Air is better than embrittle air (44:38 - 44:44)
MacBook so they're supposed to be pretty (44:40 - 44:47)

Japanese Pokemon sword and shield (46:52 - 46:56)
trailers at the very end of those (46:53 - 46:57)
trailers they always go like these are (46:56 - 46:59)
the pre-order bonuses this is the (46:57 - 47:01)
Pokemon Center exclusive you know that (46:59 - 47:03)
they they advertise at the end of these (47:01 - 47:05)
things while sometimes in America when (47:03 - 47:07)
we we get a trailer sometimes at the end (47:05 - 47:09)
it's like here's the pre-order but very (47:07 - 47:11)
rarely compared to how much its heavily (47:09 - 47:13)
advertised in Japan at the end of (47:11 - 47:16)
Twilight wings they advertise Pokemon (47:13 - 47:18)
sword and Pokemon shield they advertise (47:16 - 47:21)
those games for Japanese the Japanese (47:18 - 47:23)
audience tell like remind them also (47:21 - 47:25)

giant commercials right Pokemon company (47:25 - 47:30)
advertise everything in the Pokemon (47:28 - 47:32)
world advertises other things in the (47:30 - 47:36)
Pokemon world to get you to you know be (47:32 - 47:38)
underneath all of this like I am now (47:36 - 47:41)
buying TCG cards again and too many (47:38 - 47:44)
plushies I'm sure you could find just (47:41 - 47:45)
like when sword and shield drama happen (47:44 - 47:47)

didn't care about this and I'm sure you (47:47 - 47:51)
can sorry I'm sure you can find Japanese (47:49 - 47:53)
people that didn't care about this but (47:51 - 47:55)
I'm sure you can find plenty of Japanese (47:53 - 47:58)
people very upset about this and unlike (47:55 - 47:59)
reddit (47:58 - 48:02)
Hey Japanese people do use Twitter the (47:59 - 48:03)
people on reddit maybe don't think so (48:02 - 48:06)
but they do so there were fans that were (48:03 - 48:10)
upset that dugong is you know heavily (48:06 - 48:12)
not heavily but used in this episode and (48:10 - 48:15)
dugong is not catchable at all on sword (48:12 - 48:17)
and shield I just I just find it (48:15 - 48:18)
interesting cuz I think a lot of people (48:17 - 48:23)
here yeah I mean yes we know that like (48:18 - 48:25)
Twilight wings and the cartoon and (48:23 - 48:28)
everything are just advertisements for (48:25 - 48:30)
Pokemon products and everything but I (48:28 - 48:33)
think a lot of people in the u.s. (48:30 - 48:35)
consider them to kind of be like the (48:33 - 48:38)
cartoons to be standalone and there are (48:35 - 48:40)
people who will like watch the cartoon (48:38 - 48:42)
even though they'll never buy one of the (48:40 - 48:43)
actual games and they're like well I (48:42 - 48:46)
just like watching the cartoon and so (48:43 - 48:48)
like wouldn't even think to think oh (48:46 - 48:51)
wait there's a dugong there and there's (48:48 - 48:55)
no dugong and Galler false advertising (48:51 - 48:58)
you've tricked me into purchasing a game (48:55 - 49:04)
where I can't get a dugong I dipped I (48:58 - 49:07)
dipped too low and saw the start of the (49:04 - 49:11)

life hacker how to know if your Nintendo (54:38 - 54:44)
account was compromised in a recent (54:42 - 54:47)
Nintendo hack not specifically Pokemon (54:44 - 54:49)
related but probably relevant to our (54:47 - 54:51)
audience here I'm not sure if you guys (54:49 - 54:54)
heard about this heck no I did not hear (54:51 - 54:58)
about this about a lot of hacks well (54:54 - 55:00)
it's possible that your Nintendo account (54:58 - 55:03)
was hacked this past week here if you (55:00 - 55:05)
have been using a Nintendo network ID (55:03 - 55:07)
and an ID to log into your Nintendo (55:05 - 55:09)
account you might have some noticed some (55:07 - 55:11)
issues logging in this week Nintendo has (55:09 - 55:13)
disabled the ability to log into your (55:11 - 55:15)
nets into account through Nintendo (55:13 - 55:20)
network ID and an ID after 160,000 (55:15 - 55:22)
accounts were compromised in a recent (55:20 - 55:25)
attack you might have a NN ID from the (55:22 - 55:28)
Wii U or the 3ds in a statement Nintendo (55:25 - 55:30)
indicated that it will be resetting (55:28 - 55:33)
passwords from any nn ID or Nintendo (55:30 - 55:36)
accounts that it thinks might have been (55:33 - 55:38)
accessed by third parties but those (55:36 - 55:40)
accounts that were compromised (55:38 - 55:42)
Nintendo says there's a chance your (55:40 - 55:44)
balance and register credit may have (55:42 - 55:46)
been illegally used by at the my (55:44 - 55:49)
Nintendo store or Nintendo eShop if (55:46 - 55:51)
that's you you'll get an email from (55:49 - 55:52)
Nintendo letting you know that your (55:51 - 55:54)
password was reset when you reset your (55:52 - 55:57)
password Nintendo suggests that you not (55:54 - 55:58)
to use a password that you used for (55:57 - 56:00)
another service you should also (55:58 - 56:03)
Lifehacker recommends setup two-factor (56:00 - 56:06)
authentication on your Nintendo account (56:03 - 56:08)
if you haven't done so going forward it (56:06 - 56:09)
suggests that you use different (56:08 - 56:11)
passwords for your nn ID and you're (56:09 - 56:13)
gonna tend to account and the tendon (56:11 - 56:15)
Lifehacker suggests you should have a (56:13 - 56:18)
different password for all your accounts (56:15 - 56:21)
that's pretty standard I didn't know the (56:18 - 56:23)
two-factor was available for my Nintendo (56:21 - 56:25)
account did out a month or two ago (56:23 - 56:27)
I think it's relatively new I mean I (56:25 - 56:29)
just signed up for the Nintendo online (56:27 - 56:31)
family plan and I just didn't notice (56:29 - 56:33)
that anywhere I think you can only do it (56:31 - 56:36)
on their website I think you can only do (56:33 - 56:37)
it out and son I don't think you can (56:36 - 56:39)
activate it from the switch (56:37 - 56:42)
it has to be done on Nintendo comm yeah (56:39 - 56:44)
I knew somebody in my twitch chat that (56:42 - 56:46)
said they got hacked and the person who (56:44 - 56:48)
hacked their account downloaded (56:46 - 56:50)
fortnight and that was kind of it Oh (56:48 - 56:59)

Nintendo account to download the V bucks (57:05 - 57:12)
200 IQ so it was you what you're saying (57:08 - 57:14)

piece has also stopped production (57:47 - 57:58)

found the one piece the one do you not (58:01 - 58:08)
understand the story of one piece (58:06 - 58:10)
they're not looking for the one piece (58:08 - 58:12)
they're looking for Curly's gold is that (58:10 - 58:18)
not the one piece it's the fruit you eat (58:12 - 58:20)
one piece of the fruit you become a (58:18 - 58:31)
wacky comic-book character hey what's (58:20 - 58:33)
the name of the fruit cuz the fruits got (58:31 - 58:38)
a stupid young fruit gum god I've (58:33 - 58:41)
watched a lot of one piece and nowhere (58:38 - 58:43)
neat like percentage twice of how much (58:41 - 58:46)
one piece I've watched it's like maybe (58:43 - 58:50)
three percent which is still like a man (58:46 - 58:53)
it's like the bleach of (58:50 - 58:58)
Oh cartoons bleach I wiII stab people I (58:53 - 59:00)
never made it to the end of bleach (58:58 - 59:01)

I just keep watching the first hundred (59:01 - 59:06)
and fifty episodes so there (59:03 - 59:09)
so there's devil fruits and blue he ate (59:06 - 59:11)
the gumgum fruit I believe which is (59:09 - 59:14)
called the one-piece no the one-piece is (59:11 - 59:17)
the treasure no the treasure is (59:14 - 59:20)
somebody's treasure it's you eat one (59:17 - 59:22)
piece of the fruit and you get a wacky (59:20 - 59:25)
powers and you can't swim which is bad (59:22 - 59:29)
in a water world ooh yeah sounds like an (59:25 - 59:31)
that great site they should really put (59:29 - 59:33)
one they should really put a hat from (59:31 - 59:35)
one piece on a Pikachu and put in (59:33 - 59:38)
Pokemon go yeah yeah they should that be (59:35 - 59:39)
really got an idea (59:38 - 59:43)
I don't remember real quick in one (59:39 - 59:45)
sentence how was your Pokemon go (59:43 - 59:47)
Community Day at home I didn't stay at (59:45 - 59:50)
home I went to the art park but it was (59:47 - 59:53)
good the part at home was not good but (59:50 - 59:55)
walking in the park was good I did stay (59:53 - 59:57)
home I completed the entire thing in (59:55 - 60:01)
about 40 minutes I only got two shiny (59:57 - 60:04)
APRA's I still don't understand why the (60:01 - 60:07)
a bros we're congregating after the (60:04 - 60:09)
professor made such a fuss about we have (60:07 - 60:10)
to find out why the average are (60:09 - 60:14)
congregating something team rocket (60:10 - 60:17)
wasn't even Team Rocket it wasn't he's (60:14 - 60:19)
used us he was literally like I'll give (60:17 - 60:21)
you a Team Rocket radar even though it (60:19 - 60:23)
has nothing to do with this I have one (60:21 - 60:28)
that you can enjoy that's the start of (60:23 - 60:30)
the pyramid scheme he gives you the free (60:28 - 60:32)
one we start selling Team Rocket then (60:30 - 60:35)
you're like I'm yeah I'm there for it I (60:32 - 60:38)
did all six hours I thought getting to (60:35 - 60:41)
Pokemon an hour off an incense 120 (60:38 - 60:44)
Pokemon an hour super good it was really (60:41 - 60:46)
great that my bond fly brought me 50 (60:44 - 60:49)
pokeballs every 30 minutes that was cool (60:46 - 60:52)
it was also notable they fixed the (60:49 - 60:55)
incense so that it was the the timer on (60:52 - 60:59)
it was like three hours 59 minutes that (60:55 - 61:02)
just kept repeating it my lucky egg (60:59 - 61:06)
Eimer however sat at negative 25 seconds (61:02 - 61:09)
for two hours yeah that's that's like (61:06 - 61:11)
the current known issue is they like (61:09 - 61:14)
aren't stacking properly it was good (61:11 - 61:16)
though it's not a crime as a it's fine (61:14 - 61:18)
it's too long better than I yeah six (61:16 - 61:19)
hours is really large for community but (61:18 - 61:21)
I get I get it you know (61:19 - 61:23)
you don't have to do all six hours and (61:21 - 61:24)
it probably really helps for people who (61:23 - 61:26)
you know might have had to work in the (61:24 - 61:28)

ori word from the lasat language in star (66:13 - 66:21)
wars it's a star war if you listen to (66:18 - 66:24)
one of Greg's multiple other podcasts (66:21 - 66:28)
you may heard a discussion of this (66:24 - 66:30)
Pokemon (66:28 - 66:34)
um it requires electrical stimulation (66:30 - 66:36)
and another pokemons (66:34 - 66:41)
presence to evolve and it's can be found (66:36 - 66:43)
near charge stone cave which is the (66:41 - 66:47)
location in Unova (66:43 - 66:49)
and there was a worldwide distribution (66:47 - 66:53)
of this pokemon in 2011 the United (66:49 - 66:54)
States was excluded from that (66:53 - 66:57)
distribution raid (66:54 - 67:01)
yeah no surprise who's that pok√©mon its (66:57 - 67:01)
it is never gonna episode 406 the chat (67:03 - 67:13)
hot episode it's Kara blast Hara blast (67:08 - 67:16)
even though that is not exactly what the (67:13 - 67:20)
exclamation is in the lasat like (67:16 - 67:26)
karabast whatever I like these Pokemon a (67:20 - 67:28)
lot (67:26 - 67:30)
okay did you okay here's the thing that (67:28 - 67:33)
I didn't say about Cara blast which is (67:30 - 67:37)
gross so you know there was the whole (67:33 - 67:44)
thing about trading a Machop and what (67:37 - 67:46)
puts the little middle dude good not (67:44 - 67:51)
Gollum uh traveler gravel er and steak (67:46 - 67:54)
steals the arms okay Cara blasts (67:51 - 67:59)
supposedly secretes acid and melts the (67:54 - 68:02)
innards of the shell mint so it can suck (67:59 - 68:06)
it out like a delicious Slurpee that's (68:02 - 68:08)
disgusting shell Mets a little cutie (68:06 - 68:12)
Cara blast is ugly (68:08 - 68:12)
that would suggest that that I don't get (68:13 - 68:17)
the shellman in the trade and yet my (68:15 - 68:18)
show no no that's not part of the (68:17 - 68:20)
evolution thing it's just like that's (68:18 - 68:23)
that's a little side side deal is the (68:20 - 68:27)
Kara blast seashell mitts unless they (68:23 - 68:29)
happen to be electrically stimulated (68:27 - 68:30)
next to each other and then it's like (68:29 - 68:34)
they one pops out of its Armour and the (68:30 - 68:36)
other one pops into it (68:34 - 68:38)
kara bless and Chum are the only pok√©mon (68:36 - 68:40)
that have to be traded for a specific (68:38 - 68:43)
pok√©mon to evolve we have to trade each (68:40 - 68:48)
other silly trivia idly there was a real (68:43 - 68:50)
cool sell Gore and the detective Pikachu (68:48 - 68:55)
video game yes he's pretty cool yeah but (68:50 - 68:58)
accelgor is the shell mint yes correct (68:55 - 69:00)
not the kara blast hey when you talk (68:58 - 69:01)
about the care bus you got to talk about (69:00 - 69:03)
the showman and then you got to talk (69:01 - 69:05)
about the escape a leader in this saga (69:03 - 69:08)
or if they all grow together like it's (69:05 - 69:11)
all puzzles and links what about the (69:08 - 69:15)
deck and cover back and cover that was a (69:11 - 69:19)
good one trading cards a good deck no it (69:15 - 69:23)
wasn't what it was good ok listen in (69:19 - 69:25)
trading card games people frequently (69:23 - 69:27)
complain to me that they don't like (69:25 - 69:29)
playing trading card games with me (69:27 - 69:31)
because I only like to play versions (69:29 - 69:34)
where I keep other people from playing (69:31 - 69:36)
at all and I get to play and I win (69:34 - 69:42)
