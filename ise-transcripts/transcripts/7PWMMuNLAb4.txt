June 12th 2020 in Pokemon journeys the series which is different than they finally fixed the title I think it was called like Pokemon the series journey yeah it was like no it was this is a slightly better name the series came before journey before anyways ash has left the ole Ola region behind with a new plan to see the world ash will travel with his new friend go spelled G Oh another boy with boundless curiosity about Pokemon with ash as determined as ever to become a pok√©mon master and go aiming to catch one of every Pokemon including the mythical Mew our heroes are in for an adventure

of the upcoming series on the official Pokemon YouTube channel the first 12 episodes will be available to watch on Netflix when the series premieres June 12th another 12 episodes will be added every three months for the duration of the season just this is a weird way of doing this remember to mark your calendar or for the debut of Pokemon journey the series on June 12th I have a Qui Nhon I have many questions on Greg you can go first because you only have one are we supposed to know who walk off the earth is j-pop here's what was it it was the PR Giants or something I remember they didn't have a hit I remember they did a Pokemon song with we are Giants or whatever that band theme is made a big deal about it I want to say that was during oh I can wait I don't know they like to mention though I have no clue who walked the earth is I was I thought you guys are gonna know I thought the earth is a Canadian indie pop band from Burlington Ontario the group is known for its music videos of covers and originals the band is well known for covering pop genre music on YouTube making use of instruments such as the ukulele and the theremin as well as looping samples the picture they included of all of them playing one guitar has me so exhausted that I can't continue and I think you were thinking of the presidents of the United States an actual band people have actually heard of I think you're right I feel like they only mentioned this is this is a tin hat theory I feel like they only mentioned the band to make that one do who did the original Pokemon theme song stew in his hatred what is his name I care he was he was so wild at that polka caught he was so crabby Greg and I met him and you could just tell he was still jaded about what happened 20 years ago what was his name for those that you know and Jason Jason Jason something for those of you that don't know when the I'll give you the too long didn't read when the Pokemon company hired Jason whatever to do the Asian page jason page to do whatever the first theme song is called I don't know to be master or whatever gotta catch em all gotta catch ya whatever it is they paid him once and that was it that was part of his contract slash deal so because Pokemon blew up and became this huge sensation he doesn't get any royalties from when they use that song he gets nothing and you can tell that he I don't know maybe he's not maybe he's just had a bad day no he was he was having a bad weekend at that point but he was he seemed very jaded about not you know about life I guess yeah all right well your your many questions about listen yeah okay so just number one hope pokey Pokemon our in Japan right they have like a dedicated time slot where they show the Pokemon cartoon on Japanese television I'm a thank you very much yeah I do not use that word because I am speaking English okay well you you do understand that nobody's told Japan about streaming that's true Japan even is blown there's no Netflix in Japan okay okay that helps even though the other port every week talks about VPN ting into Japan so you can use Japanese Netflix but okay yeah but that's that's dark web stuff regular Japan doesn't know about dark web Netflix hacking from Leo Laporte yes noted known and noted so we don't know if they just because it used to be like big would get the episodes in Japan and then like a month later we got them here yeah no that's that's how it worked so they've already done 12 episodes in Japan and then we're just gonna get all 12 dubbed they've done more than they've done more they twelve we have news regarding there's a delay on levels now well so I know for like the card fight Vanguard anime that there is a delay in those episodes coming out because of all the ability to record voice actors etc etc etc well I mean that was the primary source of all of my confusion and everything there but what what happened I thought they were like hand-in-hand with Disney now yeah well Disney's closing ranks and must own what they show so they are starting to get away from the regular Disney XD and stuff and switch just to Disney Plus which only are only have rights for what they own so I doubt Pokemon was like yeah sign everything over to Disney so but they used to have agreements with WB and Cartoon Network didn't they and they're gone can't but can it always was weird to me that Pokemon was on like WB in the morning or it was on what it was on afternoons and afternoon that's like primetime spot right if you're a cartoon being on at like 4:00 p.m. in the afternoon primetime cuz there's nothing on TV you just get off school you sit down you watch it let me think hold on it's three o'clock is Thundercats 3:30 is He Man 4 o'clock is GI Joe 4:30 is silver-eyed - there's no Silverhawks in my house it's transformers thank you very much Silverhawks came on at 5 o'clock when parents come home make you turn off the TV so that's where that car came with five my parents never came home but that was always you know the primetime spot spot is to be on non cable TV where ad revenue is at its highest because everyone has that once you add like a $70 a month subscription to channels and there's more competition commercial value goes down right so then eventually the Pokemon company sometimes they're a very cheap company maybe this is why they have so much buddy because they cheap out on stuff they got away from for kids they went with a cheaper production studio this is why the hoenn and the the the diamond and pearl anime it just looked like hot garbage I'm sure somebody's very fond of those animes and they were the special animes for them because they were 10 years old when those animes came out but animation wise they're bad I'm sure the stories are fine I haven't seen a lot of that anime specifically and then the big deal is when the Pokemon company decided to go all-in on Gen 5 and that was like the huge deal with you Nova that they signed to Cartoon Network and they're gonna be unlike the most popular cartoon channel on cable and in in retrospect as much as like Gen 5 was pretty vocally there was a lot of hate during Gen 5 and there was a lot of Mowgli loved by millions in millions I mean 5 sold well it's a good time but Gen 5 took so many like risks not only in game but the trading cards and the anime and like merchant like there's so much Gen 5 merch compared to like Gen 4 and I would even argue Gen 6 like they took so many chances with Gen 5 and then it was a huge deal they were on Cartoon Network for two whole generations right cuz X&Y was also on Cartoon Network and then there was a huge deal that they signed to Disney which you could maybe argue that Disney was the Disney Channel's bigger if not better than Cartoon Network or became that over the years maybe Disney bought enough stuff to make themselves bigger sure it was always weird to me that they were like on Disney but you could just go to pokemon.com and watch almost I think you could still watch everything from Sun and Moon yep I don't think they maybe had a good relationship with Disney he otherwise or maybe Disney didn't like that they did that I mean they're clearly not big enough to just say watch Pokemon TV right I mean they they don't have their own way of streaming like that's just not gonna be a thing and it's not gonna get enough of eyes but in their own way of streaming it's called Pokemon TV it's yeah playing they don't have the storage to keep 50,000 I don't know if that's what I'm waiting to have oh yeah I don't know I don't know what but I mean we have to like we're ignoring the fact that Disney wants to own everything they show just that's what they're doing to be like oh they didn't have a good relationship well yeah that he wanted to own everything hey wait who who is opening the Nintendo theme park is that what Disney or was that with Universal Universal who who I don't know I'm asking I don't know Universal Universal Studios Japan cracks in the relationship begin to show Super Nintendo world yeah I guess maybe maybe their relationship with Disney went sour like Greg said I mean Disney clearly wants to own everything is it that like their relationship changed because Disney Plus launched yeah I mean when Disney Plus launched their own service and they moved away from focusing on the cable networks like I don't think anything new is coming to XD that's not automatically going on Disney Plus and so I think whereas the TV contracts are weird so sending it through the air way with ad revenue versus putting it on a paid subscription with no ads and like streaming rights are already just a bonkers new foreground so I'm sure like Pokemon company was fine we you know we give you rights to air it on TV but you don't have full rights to keep it on the streaming service yeah this is the part I don't understand like ideally the the anime is there 23 minutes a week commercial to buy plushies and to buy like you know trading cards and to get you hyped for the new games and but they didn't even like didn't want to fight for like primetime TV cuz like I mean if you look at something like WWE they made a huge deal of like we're off cable and we're going back to Fox like there's still a huge deal or maybe they made a huge deal and it's not a huge deal but I think it's still a huge deal to be like we were off cable we are now on free TV where we get better ad money and that is where we want to be as opposed to Netflix gave us a bunch of money to be on Netflix but we're now we're not getting ad money and now we have another barrier of entry which is yeah paid $11.99 I think for Netflix basically I pay much more than that it depends on the plan but yeah there's there's money there I gotta keep paying for that Totoro TV home just watch it don't watch it just return it that's what I do neither so network television is isn't doing great it's hard to do network television because nobody wants cable the way it is unless they can get on one of the big networks that you can get with an antenna which I don't know that there are any left that would run a lot of kids programming they have to go somewhere people will turn into WWE like that's a known quantity and a full broadcast stations like shared will take it will put up ads and you can get that channel with an antenna without having to pay for cable it's the Cable part like you have to have cable yeah and that's expensive whereas people there's a ton of people who aren't doing that anymore that that's that is just way too much money for nothing like you're getting a bunch of stuff you don't watch well I think I'm very true I think it's proven that like a show will get somebody to sign up like I signed up for Netflix I paid the money I paid the $12.99 because I wanted to watch that new me to movie and then of course I'm assuming that there's probably studies of like somebody signs up for your subscription for one thing and then they forget and then they then now they're month two and then they're like oh well I guess I'll watch it and then the secret of subscriptions that was discovered in like 18 but like the only reason I signed up for Disney Plus was because of the Simpsons because I want to watch that in repeat so I'm sure there are parents that are like I want my kids to watch Pokemon now I have an easy way from the watch Pokemon although this is only one season and twelve episodes to start with yeah but naturally every Simpsons episode on DVD already yeah I do but but I mean Netflix is really trying to do a big push to take over or compete with Disney on the child television front yeah like they're doing a lot and they're putting out a lot of their own programming plus a lot more so they're really trying to be the Disney alternative or secondary or whatever like I have them both because I want to watch all the Star Wars stuff on Disney but like pokemons a big kids programming thing it's like it's also for nectar say hey we have Pokemon so why don't you also consider bringing your child's entertainment over here yeah it's it's like it's a good is a good cornerstone to have and how crazy controlling Disney is I'm sure it was easy to take away from them I was in a lot of tech podcast and they they talk a lot about Netflix Disney Plus what's that quick quippy whatever that new one is kwibi quickly HBO man Chi Kok hasn't launched yet but it will be launching soon this is off a BG our Netflix is going to spend more than seventeen billion dollars on original content in 2020 with Disney plus an Apple TV Plus Apple TV plus another TV service well of having made their debuts and peacock HBO Max and others slated to launch in the coming months this is a this is in January by the way so some of those did launch you might wave wondering if Netflix will stay on top much longer that's hard to imagine anyone stealing Netflix is crowned as the company spends 17.3 billion on original content  says the majority of Netflix 2020 budget will be allocated to original programming so I want to go back to the pokemon.com article which says that Pokemon the series journey will be an original program to Netflix so this is part of their seventeen point three billion billion dollar budget  says that the majority of Netflix budget will be allocated towards original programming such as the animated originals that it will produce alongside Nickelodeon and the multi-year deal that it made with game of Game of Thrones showrunner David Benioff and Dan Weiss and the deals that it made with South Korean content makers which make which believes is a stepping stone to scaling in one of Asia's wealthiest and most and largest addressable markets as for comparison to other streaming services none can come close to matching Netflix budget variety notes that Disney only plans on setting spending 1 billion on original content for Disney Plus in 2020 while another 1 billion was spent at be spent on operating expenses meanwhile AT&T has a earmarked around to Billy dollars for HBO Max and NBCUniversal claims that they set aside the same amount for the first two years of peacock combined all three of those budgets and you're still not anywhere close to Netflix is seventeen point three billion dollars that they will spend this year my response to that is number one I sincerely hope that we are going to get South Korean soap operas because those are the greatest things ever of all time if I could get be strong come soon in English I would be thrilled beyond belief ah number two Disney doesn't have to spend seventeen billion because they literally have a hundred years of content videos throw up on to their service and it's we already got it the market share that they're fighting for is very small like the majority of consumers don't want to pay more than twenty month twenty dollars a month for all of their streaming services and that's not a lot like it netflix like uh sweet spot you're right fix comes in it like 13 bucks there's not a lot left after that for what people are willing to pay for every one of these is fighting to to knock somebody out of that twenty dollar bucket but you need new content to keep people subscribed you do at a certain point there's only so many times well unless you have like a six-year-old in the house and they want to watch Toy Story every day do you pay like do you pay how much does Disney plus eleven ninety nine six ninety nine ninety nine do you pay six ninety-nine a month for a year so that's like what like seventy two dollars do you pay seventy two dollars a year for your kid to watch Toy Story 4 or do you just go to Target and you buy toys three four four fifteen bucks and then you just have it on like like they're like there's only so much that and play it on what and play it on your ps4 your that's what like that's not a lot of people what really reason about DVDs they still make DVDs is because of like minivans and road trips and everything like yeah but that's yeah about in your car all day I mean what we're talking about is in particular dizzy launched their entire what hundred year catalog like they are oh did I do the entire catalog well they kept it that we know they kept a few few sketchy things hidden hmm but therefore a lot of this generation was streaming most of that content from the 60s and 70s as is brand-new when they launched with their huge library it felt like you were getting hundreds and hundreds and hours of new content because you've never seen it before is it good content well that's up to you I saw the Fox in the Hound in the theater I enjoyed yeah it's but Disney doesn't have to ramp up more than they already are because every movie that they're producing automatically comes to their service every spin-off TV series that they make off of every superhero movie and they make one every year immediately comes to their service Disney doesn't have to spend as much money because Disney already owns so many properties they're sort of neglecting the fact that Netflix doesn't own anything and hasn't didn't come to the foreground producing anything well they are there they own like house of cards and they own like well they they own a very small amount of things that they only stir ative lee right right I started married recently so Netflix has to spend that much money to compete with things like HBO that's been running since the 80s Disney that's been running since the 20s to even come close to having that breadth of library that they call their own it will it be new and some of that stuff and ethics gonna make good sure is I'm gonna be a real bad you bet like couple of their teeth teen moms that are pretty awful like they're not the Hat they're spending the money because they have to and it's why it's sort of like this Wild Thing like look at how much money they're gonna spend they're the ones to watch it's more look at how much money they have to spend just try to stay competitive nabob Netflix isn't a good spot when everybody decided to pull everything out into their own service like they relied on every other company to give them things for people to watch and when everybody said or we could just make our own money Netflix is scrambling and has been scrambling for a year yes yeah but they're still number one well how do you count number one how do you count you count how many people are paying you they have a hundred and sixty by millions like grabbers that's the long tail of people who forgot to cancel their subscriptions they're still producing content that people are talking about house of cards yeah boring you know all the drama was was very very talked about you know stranger things is the way you think about it is anytime that Netflix wants to do something it's it's a risk it's like we're gonna produce this thing and we hope people like it but since it's never been seen before it's it's you know people might not like it it might it's just absolutely a risk and then Disney is like well you know what we're just gonna put the entire catalog of Hannah Montana out there and everybody's like heck yeah watch reruns of Hannah Montana I mean like somebody who's like 20 years younger than me 25 years younger than me sure that's like that's their childhood they walk back I used to watch friggin Gilligan's Island yeah Netflix is also the most expensive if anybody else can offer as much for cheaper people are going to jump and they have like they know that Disney Plus is a threat they know this they lost a lot to Disney they know that NBC is a threat they lost friends and as awful as that show is now people were very upset well they pulled it into their own house Netflix is scrambling to be the most expensive service out there while losing the stuff people wanted to watch yeah there's no there's no doubt that they're losing stuff so Netflix has a couple advantages there's still the biggest service that 167 million people our worldwide which other services are not there content includes Netflix originals which will be the new Pokemon anime studio ghibli except if you're in Canada u.s. and Japan you can't watch to do a Ghibli and then they have exclusive anime shows Amazon is number 2 they have a hundred million subscribers that's tied in with oh that's bonus that is bogus bogus I pay Amazon Prime because I forget to cancel it every year I'm not a subscriber they do have a hundred million people signed of all 100 million people signed up for Amazon Prime they are worldwide as well they have Amazon Studios they're producing their own TV shows like Netflix they have the Discovery Channel and they have ai TV I don't know what a TV is so Hulu has 30 million subscribers compared to a Netflix is 167 million they have NBC ABC fox a and E big 10 Bravo E PBS oxygen more Fox stuff sci fi USA and they're only available so who was only available in the US and Japan and then Disney Plus has 50 million subscribers which is Disney Marvel Star Wars Pixar National Geographic and 20th century Studios which I believe is citizens Disney owns the majority share in Hulu right yes everybody else pulled out so like Disney owns Hulu and Disney plus and so Disney has the disadvantage and Hulu has the disadvantage not being worldwide so they're only available in United States Canada Netherlands Australia New Zealand Austria Germany Ireland Italy Spain Switzerland and the United Kingdom so that's not a lot of countries they have something called Disney Plus hot star which has 300 million people which is star India HBO Showtime that's specifically available in India and Southeast Asia they have ESPN Plus which has 3.5 million users which has UFC that's only available in the United States and then you have CBS all access which has 10 million users at CBS and paramount not worldwide HBO now has 8 million users which is HBO stuff Universal Pictures Warner Brothers 20th century it's only available in the United States HBO max hasn't launched yet peacock hasn't launched yet but that's NBC Universal DreamWorks Animation Telemundo I know all our Spanish listeners Telemundo come into peacock that'll that'll save that Jim I would subscribe to that I can watch sabado gigante so don't even scoff at that YouTube premium that's a thing they got 20 million users also worldwide do they have YouTube originals apparently I don't know what any of those are Apple TV plus has 10 million users they have only just quotes original content once again just because I bought an Apple product does not make me a subscriber crunchyroll has 2 million users and when when when it's crunch you're all getting bought by either Disney Plus or Hulu or Netflix like I feel like that's coming it is owned by somebody that I am intimately familiar with well that's also like that's like such a fit because like I will watch crunchyroll without paying for it I mean I do that horrible ads if crunchyroll does anime and manga and whatnot why wouldn't they just put Pokemon on crunchyroll but I don't think crunchyroll could pay what the Pokemon company would probably want in rights to their show I think you're right besides Netflix being number one Disney Disney is what the Pokemon company walked away from there I don't know how do you how are you on Disney for three seasons and then you're like all right I'm we're done we're out like it was either money or they're just having happy with this near Disney load bottom on content I mean I've heard that from people where Disney thinks that because they are Disney they can lowball people they love all everybody that they do since this is public knowledge because I've looked it up crunchyroll is owned by AT&T and Warner Media oh ok so there's a reason crunchyroll is owned by Warner Media who's owned by AT&T so the reason why they don't have those things and there's a lot of sort of behind the scene stuff happening with crunchyroll and vrv is because HBO max and AT&T now are things and there's a lot of questions about what's happening with crunchyroll as part of all of that but 18t and warner media owned crunchyroll just an FYI so this is off this lot the LA Times this was September 16 2019 so Netflix paid 500 million for the office and Warner Media paid 425 million for friends Netflix did make a huge deal about getting Seinfeld although I don't see the prices here but then Hulu paid for the exclusive rights for Seinfeld which was a hundred and thirty million for a six-year deal which expires next year so I guess that's either Gary signing wasn't that an NBC product though Seinfeld Seinfeld yeah definitely so there's no way peacocks not gonna take that back yeah oh I'm sure Pete I like Pete well duh but the whole thing about peacock is they were going to be the exclusive streaming service of the Olympics and then the Olympics got delayed so if this if Seinfeld ends in 2021 they are taking it back peacock will take it back and then they will make a huge deal about how Seinfeld is on peacock and the Olympics is on peacock and this is why you should sign up for peacock give us our portion every $20 a month I feel I know I pale I got a check by streaming service I just got a message that my CBS all access resub after they said they weren't going to and I cancelled it immediately the other question is we already know that Netflix gets really unsettling set after two seasons of a show and loves to cancel things so are they going to be upset if Pokemon doesn't bring in whatever market they want because Netflix this whole thing is they want shows that make new people sign up and if that show stops making new people sign up then they usually ax the show so is this only going to be like a short-term two-year deal before Netflix is like oh we don't want it or is like the Pokemon company being like we're making our own streaming service yeah and we need two years of buffers so let's at least sit on Netflix for two years if Netflix dumps it after two years like every other station has dumped Pokemon after two years like everybody's done it yeah then they're used to it so they'll just have to find somewhere new whoever wants to take them yeah maybe a Disney dump Pokemon maybe Pokemon didn't walk away from Disney maybe Disney was like you know what we don't want you anymore it could be maybe in two years Pokemon company was really happy and maybe Netflix was really happy with the Mewtwo movie probably I mean they've had a lot of I think they've been having some success because there's a bunch of Pokemon stuff already on Netflix and I'm sure they've seen success from that okay that was exciting news though I guess I'm keeping my Netflix subscription yeah I was gonna cancel it after I saw the Mewtwo movie but not now not now I guess it's now it's now considered a business all right look we're gonna take a quick break when we come back we got some more news to cover but we will BRB but your your your player character in this game is called chase and the female character character is called late late [Music] [Music] the anime news doesn't stop gentlemen more this is off here more anime news this is off Anime News Network calm a trusted thirst an enemy the Internet's most trusted source please get their tagline right oh is that I was I was even looking is that true it says the Internet's most trusted anime news source that's their tagline I don't know them I'm die don't trust him anymore now way to toot your own horn you're hiding something they right here this is published April 19th the official Twitter account for the new apakah tossers tell us they use the word Pocket Monsters that's how you can tell there Wow the anime through Pocket Monsters television anime revealed on Sunday that staff are temporarily de spending part of production of the series due to kovat 19 situation and a state of emergency has been declared in Japan as a result new episodes are delayed and channels will re-air old episodes starting next week the staff rule will reveal a later date when the anime will return the show premiered on TV Tokyo and its affiliates on November 17th two days after the Pokemon a sword and shield games shipped worldwide the series was airing Sundays at 6 p.m. the same timeslot that was in Sun and Moon this is like the first time the anime is like not been on the air this will be the longest I think the anime will not be on air because of a situation yeah I mean this is no surprise as I said the card fight Vanguard annum mm cartoon is also delayed because they can't get the voice actors into studios but but we know what I find interesting and you may double-check me on this Greg because I Steve Scott no clue I believe that my hero academia voice actors are actually recording in their homes for an English dub yes I believe they are but I will say this it is I don't know Sandra practices I run for a lot of people but a lot of when a show is first starting they make everybody come into a recording studio and then once the it's established and these they can trust these people then they allow them if that person has recording to be at home to go home and do it so it is very pop my hero is clearly popular across multiple platforms the double is good so I'm sure they have more flexibility to work from hope that they're allowing them to work from home I don't know what pokemons issue is coz what these people have been doing it for years but they may not have they may not have good studios at home but there's that but I mean this is the also the original Japanese recording right not right dub not a translation and the the issue with recording from home is that you don't have a director who can like say which take you know they prefer right you're kind of doing it on your own you're doing but you tend to do multiple takes and send them in okay the zoom call in Japan nobody told you pan but zoom look I have tried to record audio from zoom a discord is better it's like recording off of zoom is the worst experience I've ever had it's it's tough because we have decent recording equipment nothing what's needed for professionals there's a level of soundproof like there's so many things that have to go into being able to do this professionally at home that I don't know how they do it a lot of them aren't like I love them just don't have the space or have well they're not a guard level right so they just don't know how like arrests they have their precious hand holders and keepers you guide them to a chair to sit and yack into a microphone for a few hours they just they're lost I'm also I don't know how much the animation happens after the recording because it's so much dude so many people do it where they have the people read the lines and then the animators match the mouths to the performances yeah that's part of the original Japanese part of it yes I so agree so yeah and also they don't want a bunch of people coming into an animation studio right congregating there right so like I doubt they have animators working and they're gonna make their voice actors match the mouth shapes like well but but also added and it professional animation is not a work from home no it is not a deal you you need some high-powered rendering type computers never I mean I well actually I could be completely wrong I've never tried to animate it okay that I imagined I thought that macbook air started rendering out some animation I having a MacBook Air is better than embrittle air MacBook so they're supposed to be pretty good all right you guys thought the anime news stopped there there you visited there's even more ever enough cartoon news and there's never never enough I have two articles I don't know what has the better dialogue here let's do Screen Rant screenrant's dot-com there trusted news and ranting April 26 Pokemon company apologizes from a promoting sword and shield with dugong the Pokemon company has issued an apology on Twitter after the newest episode of Twilight wings included the first gen Pokemon dugong just for complete transparency this is the Japanese Twitter and the Japanese promotion the Pokemon company has apologized for using dugong to promote pokemon sword and shield in the latest episode of the twilight wings miniseries the company has released one episode each month at the beginning of 2020 all have premiered free on you too although although twilight wings is set in the gala region which debuted in sword and shield it is not part of the mainline Pokemon anime which has been recently put on hiatus and then it goes on saying that Pokemon shield is the best selling Pokemon game in a long time do not include all the Pokemon so I'll jump over to Nintendo life which has a little bit more information here so they have the tweet translated by google translate so it says apology and web animation Tsubaki no tsubasa some poke I don't know what that means Andrew will message us and slack and say that my Japanese is very poor and this is what it means yep some Pokemon that did not appear in Pokemon sword and shield appeared I'm sorry for making a misleading expression I'm very bad Google Translate just not good pretty much they had to apologize because okay so if you guys don't know ah when Twilight ring won Twilight wings runs in Japan a lot just like a lot of Pokemon trailers even if you were to watch Japanese Pokemon sword and shield trailers at the very end of those trailers they always go like these are the pre-order bonuses this is the Pokemon Center exclusive you know that they they advertise at the end of these things while sometimes in America when we we get a trailer sometimes at the end it's like here's the pre-order but very rarely compared to how much its heavily advertised in Japan at the end of Twilight wings they advertise Pokemon sword and Pokemon shield they advertise those games for Japanese the Japanese audience tell like remind them also we've been saying this that these are giant commercials right Pokemon company advertise everything in the Pokemon world advertises other things in the Pokemon world to get you to you know be underneath all of this like I am now buying TCG cards again and too many plushies I'm sure you could find just like when sword and shield drama happen I'm sure you could find people that didn't care about this and I'm sure you can sorry I'm sure you can find Japanese people that didn't care about this but I'm sure you can find plenty of Japanese people very upset about this and unlike reddit Hey Japanese people do use Twitter the people on reddit maybe don't think so but they do so there were fans that were upset that dugong is you know heavily not heavily but used in this episode and dugong is not catchable at all on sword and shield I just I just find it interesting cuz I think a lot of people here yeah I mean yes we know that like Twilight wings and the cartoon and everything are just advertisements for Pokemon products and everything but I think a lot of people in the u.s. consider them to kind of be like the cartoons to be standalone and there are people who will like watch the cartoon even though they'll never buy one of the actual games and they're like well I just like watching the cartoon and so like wouldn't even think to think oh wait there's a dugong there and there's no dugong and Galler false advertising you've tricked me into purchasing a game where I can't get a dugong I dipped I dipped too low and saw the start of the comments and I am forever regretful of my scrolling wait the comments on what oh I didn't even know this patience out [Music] there oh my gosh the best thing I saw this is super off-topic so if you if you ever want a good laugh anytime the poke at the Pokemon company Twitter tweets that anything like tweets anything like you know you know Rhett reddits has a cool Pokemon in insert right at that jiff right any time the Pokemon company tweets there's always like the nat the the there's always a couple people that you know have a hashtag bring back all Pokemon it's there's like somebody somebody in the world designed like these posters that say that like have a Pokemon on it and then it's like hashtag bring back all Pokemon hashtag bring back mega evolution hashtag bring back what like Z moves or something I don't remember what the last one is I don't even know what I clicked on I think it was I think it was the the tweets for the sword and the the Pokemon journeys anime there was a picture of Raichu and then it said hashtag bring back all Pokemon hashtag bring back mega evolution hashtag something-something this poster doesn't make sense like it's right shoes in the game they want you and you all wait you always you always see these posters if you decide to go down the darker at web of seeing like who's replying to the Pokemon company somebody said hey like right why are you using this poster ride shoes in the game and the person was like well you clearly didn't read the poster it also says bring back mega evolution right you doesn't make evolve no a right it doesn't and then the whole that I was like dying the entire time reading it and they said yeah I they said bring back mega evolution and then the guy said well somebody else cut chimed in and said no one wants mega rayquaza back so the guy who posted the poster that said like clearly you didn't read it says all it also says bring back Michael evolution and the guy replies back well I didn't say bring back mega Rayquaza bring back all of them but that one and I was like like this this is these are the people the ones that are going out of their way saving these like images of like Tropius and right you and some people like what at mega Charizard these are the people that are fighting to bring back every Pokemon and then when challenged on it they specifically well not mega Rayquaza can't mean to can't not all of them but that was humanitarian your day to just propose so while you were just enjoying that particular rant there I have watched the entirety of Pokemon Twilight wings episode 4 early evening waves huh the dugong appear for approximately 4 seconds worth of the episode yes there are like a would you call them a herd of dugong this is it a fish they're not fish well what do you call a group of seal so I don't know I don't know what the collective of seals are either way yes you do see a collection of them there are three that literally jump over her head as things entirely I got some good news though oh good Pokemon Rumble rush to shut down no thing that nobody used this is off Eurogamer smartphone game pokemon rumble rush will switch itself off after just a year of operation the free-to-play game has announced it will shut down on July 22nd 14 months to the day after it launched worldwide Rumble rush is the fifth in the Pokemon Rumble series and follows previous entries from the Wii the 3ds and the Wii U it transferred for the series simple Pokemon toy mechanics to your touch one screen will let you plug in your mind it's into account for my Nintendo rewards and you could use the accounts that saved me figure as your playable character is the second app to closed supported by my Nintendo following the shutdown of Nintendo's own miitomo in 2018 the app did attract 10 million downloads but it was shut down after two years oh that was me Toma I don't know how many people have fellow trouble rush I guess I don't think anyone was surprised I don't know I think anything could have really saved this game we literally only talked about it at lunch and never again true yeah it was a game it was a game that existed alright last news article this is off life hacker how to know if your Nintendo account was compromised in a recent Nintendo hack not specifically Pokemon related but probably relevant to our audience here I'm not sure if you guys heard about this heck no I did not hear about this about a lot of hacks well it's possible that your Nintendo account was hacked this past week here if you have been using a Nintendo network ID and an ID to log into your Nintendo account you might have some noticed some issues logging in this week Nintendo has disabled the ability to log into your nets into account through Nintendo network ID and an ID after 160,000 accounts were compromised in a recent attack you might have a NN ID from the Wii U or the 3ds in a statement Nintendo indicated that it will be resetting passwords from any nn ID or Nintendo accounts that it thinks might have been accessed by third parties but those accounts that were compromised Nintendo says there's a chance your balance and register credit may have been illegally used by at the my Nintendo store or Nintendo eShop if that's you you'll get an email from Nintendo letting you know that your password was reset when you reset your password Nintendo suggests that you not to use a password that you used for another service you should also Lifehacker recommends setup two-factor authentication on your Nintendo account if you haven't done so going forward it suggests that you use different passwords for your nn ID and you're gonna tend to account and the tendon Lifehacker suggests you should have a different password for all your accounts that's pretty standard I didn't know the two-factor was available for my Nintendo account did out a month or two ago I think it's relatively new I mean I just signed up for the Nintendo online family plan and I just didn't notice that anywhere I think you can only do it on their website I think you can only do it out and son I don't think you can activate it from the switch it has to be done on Nintendo comm yeah I knew somebody in my twitch chat that said they got hacked and the person who hacked their account downloaded fortnight and that was kind of it Oh brutal I think that maybe they're trying to get to login to get them V bugs right you download the fortnight you log in with your account you use the my Nintendo account to download the V bucks 200 IQ so it was you what you're saying I'm trying to get all the V bucks here because you you want to overtake ninja as the number one fortnight is that a thing am I saying that right ah I think just so plays for tonight yes mixer zone famous ninja he moved off switch yeah yeah like a year ago oh geez I only watch caffeine I don't know about twittered mixer brandon sent in the Pokemon journey stuff Andrew I said that among the Pokemon anime stopping one piece has also stopped production temporarily how how are they still going I think so yeah I don't think they've found the one piece the one do you not understand the story of one piece they're not looking for the one piece they're looking for Curly's gold is that not the one piece it's the fruit you eat one piece of the fruit you become a wacky comic-book character hey what's the name of the fruit cuz the fruits got a stupid young fruit gum god I've watched a lot of one piece and nowhere neat like percentage twice of how much one piece I've watched it's like maybe three percent which is still like a man it's like the bleach of Oh cartoons bleach I wiII stab people I never made it to the end of bleach either I just keep watching the first hundred and fifty episodes so there so there's devil fruits and blue he ate the gumgum fruit I believe which is called the one-piece no the one-piece is the treasure no the treasure is somebody's treasure it's you eat one piece of the fruit and you get a wacky powers and you can't swim which is bad in a water world ooh yeah sounds like an that great site they should really put one they should really put a hat from one piece on a Pikachu and put in Pokemon go yeah yeah they should that be really got an idea I don't remember real quick in one sentence how was your Pokemon go Community Day at home I didn't stay at home I went to the art park but it was good the part at home was not good but walking in the park was good I did stay home I completed the entire thing in about 40 minutes I only got two shiny APRA's I still don't understand why the a bros we're congregating after the professor made such a fuss about we have to find out why the average are congregating something team rocket wasn't even Team Rocket it wasn't he's used us he was literally like I'll give you a Team Rocket radar even though it has nothing to do with this I have one that you can enjoy that's the start of the pyramid scheme he gives you the free one we start selling Team Rocket then you're like I'm yeah I'm there for it I did all six hours I thought getting to Pokemon an hour off an incense 120 Pokemon an hour super good it was really great that my bond fly brought me 50 pokeballs every 30 minutes that was cool it was also notable they fixed the incense so that it was the the timer on it was like three hours 59 minutes that just kept repeating it my lucky egg Eimer however sat at negative 25 seconds for two hours yeah that's that's like the current known issue is they like aren't stacking properly it was good though it's not a crime as a it's fine it's too long better than I yeah six hours is really large for community but I get I get it you know you don't have to do all six hours and it probably really helps for people who you know might have had to work in the morning or work out evening or yeah I did stop in the middle and then go to the art park and take pictures of the portal and catch a bunch of Pokemon and successfully socially distance because people were actually socially just seeing this time at the park which is really nice question of the week all of your thoughts really interest me I want to know what you believe you believe if you have something to ask us just drop us a line hit me Steve it's question time oh boy I love Britney I feel like this is getting worse and worse words that was fantastic that's pretty alright pretty alright quit hasn't worked on that for like an hour maybe 20 minutes this is gay but you are now head of the Pokemon company what is the first thing you do I tell Japan the Dutch reveal all the secrets to Japan yeah the thing is we haven't been telling you here's well here's here's what's up Japan FYI what's the first thing I do pay off my house or I've been making the pig bucks at that point right by turn up see ya bye all the turnips and put them in my turnip storage downstairs bring back Pokemon Ranger ooh is nice quoi ever make a mystery - ooh [Laughter] I'm the big boy mr. Pokemon I could do whatever I want hmmm I think what I'm going to do is have like a secret like super-secret Apple level of security team work on a much more adult let's say complex because I don't like to say adult in those terms a much more complex advanced version of Pokemon Pokemon dark here's the deal it's only available on Xbox and Playstation I can't play the hardware you are gonna ruin all the business deals you're gonna drive that company into the ground oh I forgot the second thing I do is I make a book of mine mmm oh so choke on it Steve nice knowing the Pokemon company they're gonna fold in two and a half years after you take over Greg what I know how to make an MMO you you have no idea that game would be amazing I've already sold my MMO to like four people who are into it first thing I would do is tell my staff to stop working on a gen four remain yeah that's right I mean I don't you go back to it though I've walked through mouth coordinates I don't need to go through it again Wow snap okay the second thing I would do though is Magikarp jumped okay you are driving this company into the floor now magic carpets you is a Magikarp you would be a look it's gonna do better than Rumble rush okay we're setting the bar that low then you can't say that I'm directly the company they gone with an actual successful MMO no animals are outdated come on that's like there's a guy get the yeah getting that living game grind Animal Crossing gotta just put updates out every month what do you think mmo's do will give us our poke of out of the week good gracious following up on that I just want to quote for you an apple but I'll keep it to myself she has a song called never promise and a new album that's real good so if you haven't checked out the new fiona output apple album go for it last week's pokemon it is not related to fiona apple it is related to a excellent ori word from the lasat language in star wars it's a star war if you listen to one of Greg's multiple other podcasts you may heard a discussion of this Pokemon um it requires electrical stimulation and another pokemons presence to evolve and it's can be found near charge stone cave which is the location in Unova and there was a worldwide distribution of this pokemon in 2011 the United States was excluded from that distribution raid yeah no surprise who's that pok√©mon its it is never gonna episode 406 the chat hot episode it's Kara blast Hara blast even though that is not exactly what the exclamation is in the lasat like karabast whatever I like these Pokemon a lot okay did you okay here's the thing that I didn't say about Cara blast which is gross so you know there was the whole thing about trading a Machop and what puts the little middle dude good not Gollum uh traveler gravel er and steak steals the arms okay Cara blasts supposedly secretes acid and melts the innards of the shell mint so it can suck it out like a delicious Slurpee that's disgusting shell Mets a little cutie Cara blast is ugly that would suggest that that I don't get the shellman in the trade and yet my show no no that's not part of the evolution thing it's just like that's that's a little side side deal is the Kara blast seashell mitts unless they happen to be electrically stimulated next to each other and then it's like they one pops out of its Armour and the other one pops into it kara bless and Chum are the only pok√©mon that have to be traded for a specific pok√©mon to evolve we have to trade each other silly trivia idly there was a real cool sell Gore and the detective Pikachu video game yes he's pretty cool yeah but accelgor is the shell mint yes correct not the kara blast hey when you talk about the care bus you got to talk about the showman and then you got to talk about the escape a leader in this saga or if they all grow together like it's all puzzles and links what about the deck and cover back and cover that was a good one trading cards a good deck no it wasn't what it was good ok listen in trading card games people frequently complain to me that they don't like playing trading card games with me because I only like to play versions where I keep other people from playing at all and I get to play and I win getting cover was that yeah 100% was like on your turn you do nothing on my turn I kill you I don't know why that's fun alright uh so my friend Chris asked me for this week's Pokemon to do something particular yes say Chris there's like 70 that well it's not Chris from New Jersey it's not Chris from Ohio it is Chris from Texas Oh does that help you need to say Texas Chris Texas Chris okay so he asked that I do something for Earth Day and he asked that I do a haiku I did for haiku I don't know how you pluralized that word haiku so there you go no
