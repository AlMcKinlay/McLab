English as love but it actually just (1:56 - 2:01)

50 cents that means okay (2:41 - 2:46)
Chrome (2:45 - 2:51)
not okay not okay that means right or (2:46 - 2:54)
certainly or indeed oh you got you (2:51 - 2:57)
cancel your plans I don't have plans go (2:54 - 2:59)
nowhere (2:57 - 3:01)
stay at home what do you think I'm doing (2:59 - 3:04)
I'm gonna do great in South Korea I'm (3:01 - 3:09)
sure clearly not nah clearly not you got (3:04 - 3:12)
fighting is so important (3:09 - 3:17)
uh Greg is here I am here I have no (3:12 - 3:19)
working feet (3:17 - 3:22)
so this should be real exciting (3:19 - 3:22)
I don't know if we want to expand on (3:23 - 3:27)
this they don't work they they decided (3:24 - 3:31)
to cease functioning completely both at (3:27 - 3:35)
different times from each other (3:31 - 3:35)
all right fair enough uh we got a pretty (3:36 - 3:42)
loaded show maybe it feels loaded (3:40 - 3:43)
because I have show notes yeah that's (3:42 - 3:44)
the only reason because I looked at the (3:43 - 3:47)
show notes like we have about an hour (3:44 - 3:49)
this is nothing yeah (3:47 - 3:52)
yeah so how how are we gonna do anything (3:49 - 3:55)
well we'll we'll do it in the show note (3:52 - 3:59)
order uh Community Day is uh in a couple (3:55 - 4:01)
hours so we're gonna try to record the (3:59 - 4:04)
show I'm also uh as as well practiced (4:01 - 4:07)
some uh Korean with us uh I am also (4:04 - 4:08)
leaving for Korea very soon because (4:07 - 4:11)
there is a Safari Zone in South Korea (4:08 - 4:13)
I'm going to go to that apparently I'm (4:11 - 4:15)
gonna go to that I paid for a flight (4:13 - 4:18)
there Niantic offered me one free ticket (4:15 - 4:20)
a very generous of them (4:18 - 4:22)
I have not gotten that free ticket (4:20 - 4:24)
although I don't think that event's (4:22 - 4:25)
going to sell out so if Niantic bails on (4:24 - 4:28)
my free ticket I can just buy a ticket (4:25 - 4:28)
um (4:28 - 4:30)
the debate with Niantic was whether they (4:28 - 4:31)
were going to offer me a three-day (4:30 - 4:35)
ticket like they did for the other (4:31 - 4:39)
go Fest or a one day ticket but some (4:35 - 4:41)
behind the scenes is that there are (4:39 - 4:44)
different regional managers in charge of (4:41 - 4:45)
certain areas (4:44 - 4:47)
so there's like the (4:45 - 4:49)
North American (4:47 - 4:52)
actually I'm not sure if they're in (4:49 - 4:54)
charge of most of the Americas but uh (4:52 - 4:56)
they're in charge of that and then (4:54 - 4:57)
there's the (4:56 - 5:00)
the European one and this is the (4:57 - 5:05)
Asia and South Pacific manager I think I (5:00 - 5:08)
usually pronounce Asia Oceania yes uh (5:05 - 5:09)
and so I've never worked with them (5:08 - 5:10)
before (5:09 - 5:14)
um so they're they're like oh cool it's (5:10 - 5:16)
cool that you're coming I have to go get (5:14 - 5:18)
this approved even though it's (5:16 - 5:21)
I don't know so we'll figure it out who (5:18 - 5:23)
knows if I even make it to you know (5:21 - 5:25)
South Korea a lot of things that could (5:23 - 5:27)
go wrong I could be stopped in Canada (5:25 - 5:30)
for some odd reason did I I told you (5:27 - 5:31)
about my friend who never got out of (5:30 - 5:34)
Canada right on the on the big overseas (5:31 - 5:36)
trip that their school was supposed to (5:34 - 5:38)
take no but I have to like fill out a (5:36 - 5:41)
separate app for Canada and I think when (5:38 - 5:43)
I get to South Korea I have to take a (5:41 - 5:45)
covet test within 24 hours and then (5:43 - 5:48)
prove it to the government I don't it's (5:45 - 5:50)
look I just want to go to the Dunkin (5:48 - 5:53)
Donuts live restaurant in South Korea (5:50 - 5:55)
how much is that to ask for (5:53 - 5:57)
a lot because you may never get out of (5:55 - 5:58)
Canada (5:57 - 6:00)
in which case we're gonna go to Tim (5:58 - 6:02)
Hortons live (6:00 - 6:05)
uh you know Canada so true that's so (6:02 - 6:06)
true (6:05 - 6:09)
uh okay so let's get into the Pokemon (6:06 - 6:11)
news there is (6:09 - 6:14)
quite a bit of misinformation around (6:11 - 6:18)
Pokemon this week what are you talking (6:14 - 6:20)
about and I'm here to clear it all up uh (6:18 - 6:22)
I'm here to clear it all up no (6:20 - 6:25)
everything is outrageous I can't believe (6:22 - 6:27)
they did that thing and how dare they (6:25 - 6:30)
make that decision what is going on this (6:27 - 6:32)
company is the worst Pokemon has been (6:30 - 6:35)
going downhill since I was a 10 year old (6:32 - 6:40)
child and I didn't know how life worked (6:35 - 6:40)
that was a long time ago Greg it was the (6:40 - 6:48)
70s uh I appreciate the uh the voice in (6:44 - 6:50)
your opinion uh okay so the first the (6:48 - 6:52)
first thing we're going to talk about (6:50 - 6:55)
uh is actually the first bit of Mis (6:52 - 6:59)
information that went around uh (6:55 - 7:01)
I feel like I have to live through this (6:59 - 7:02)
like multiple times I have to live (7:01 - 7:04)
through this on Twitter and no one wants (7:02 - 7:06)
to live through events on Twitter and (7:04 - 7:07)
then I have to live through this through (7:06 - 7:09)
my twitch stream and then because not (7:07 - 7:11)
everyone watches every waking moment of (7:09 - 7:13)
my twitch stream it's like perpetually (7:11 - 7:15)
living through it because every like (7:13 - 7:16)
once an hour somebody comes through and (7:15 - 7:18)
they're like did you hear this news I'm (7:16 - 7:21)
like ah here we go again uh boy I wish (7:18 - 7:23)
the podcast was up sooner because I need (7:21 - 7:26)
to clear the air here what you need to (7:23 - 7:28)
do is we need to have (7:26 - 7:32)
mid-week small bite podcasts Red Alert (7:28 - 7:35)
is called Red Alert you're dumb (7:32 - 7:35)
uh Red Alert is is a warning system it's (7:36 - 7:42)
a song by basement Jax it's a lot of (7:40 - 7:45)
things so the the Tokyo game show (7:42 - 7:48)
happened TGs uh (7:45 - 7:51)
that that you know uh that that is that (7:48 - 7:55)
it's like E3 or Gamescom but for Japan (7:51 - 7:58)
uh you know when they announced like fun (7:55 - 8:03)
to go to though right uh TGs is fun (7:58 - 8:05)
yeah I mean I think anything in Japan is (8:03 - 8:07)
fun (8:05 - 8:07)
I'm not going to say that anything in (8:08 - 8:13)
Japan is fun but I'm playing the Tokyo (8:11 - 8:15)
game channel it's like it's fun to go to (8:13 - 8:17)
something there's such things in Japan (8:15 - 8:21)
not fun uh and then there is there's the (8:17 - 8:24)
Japan game awards that happen there (8:21 - 8:29)
and uh there was (8:24 - 8:29)
a new site that reported on this I (8:30 - 8:35)
I (8:33 - 8:37)
Den (8:35 - 8:39)
faminecogamer.jp dot Slash new whatever (8:37 - 8:42)
that's not too important but of course (8:39 - 8:44)
because it is a Japanese News website (8:42 - 8:47)
their website is in Japanese and there's (8:44 - 8:48)
a little button at the top of your (8:47 - 8:51)
browser that usually goes to you hate it (8:48 - 8:52)
and you you hit the button and it says (8:51 - 8:56)
translate and I would assume most people (8:52 - 8:58)
know that that translating tool isn't (8:56 - 9:00)
the best (8:58 - 9:02)
uh but you know it's very easy to hit (9:00 - 9:05)
that translate button and then uh go (9:02 - 9:07)
with what Google thinks those words mean (9:05 - 9:09)
and then make a tweet about it and then (9:07 - 9:11)
that tweet gets a bunch of retweets that (9:09 - 9:14)
sounds suspicious I believe that the (9:11 - 9:17)
engineers at Google have created (9:14 - 9:19)
absolutely perfect (9:17 - 9:23)
translations judging by how well their (9:19 - 9:25)
Auto closed captioning works on YouTube (9:23 - 9:28)
I cannot find a fault in how they would (9:25 - 9:32)
translate a language I don't read (9:28 - 9:32)
um so there's a lot of Pokemon games (9:32 - 9:37)
that won awards uh I'm just gonna I'm (9:34 - 9:38)
we're just gonna go I'm just gonna read (9:37 - 9:40)
what we have here in what Google (9:38 - 9:43)
translate thinks that it was supposed to (9:40 - 9:46)
be minister of economy trade and (9:43 - 9:51)
Industry award uh that went to uh the (9:46 - 9:54)
director from from software (9:51 - 9:57)
uh from software made uh (9:54 - 10:00)
they they make the Dark Souls games uh (9:57 - 10:02)
they also made Eldon ring not sure what (10:00 - 10:04)
minister of economy trade and Industry (10:02 - 10:07)
reward is supposed like I'm not sure how (10:04 - 10:09)
we got there or is that that's what it's (10:07 - 10:11)
really called but it looks like to me I (10:09 - 10:12)
would probably translate to best (10:11 - 10:17)
producer this is the award given from (10:12 - 10:19)
the minister of economy trading industry (10:17 - 10:21)
whoever that currently is in Japan (10:19 - 10:24)
gave an award for being cool and that's (10:21 - 10:26)
what that award is (10:24 - 10:29)
uh three there is the we're gonna Circle (10:26 - 10:30)
back to this one there's the global (10:29 - 10:34)

just reading Google translate we'll (10:47 - 10:51)
clear this all up next one is global (10:49 - 10:54)
that's absolutely understandable it's a (10:51 - 10:56)
global award for a Japanese work company (10:54 - 10:59)
they gave them an award for being (10:56 - 11:01)

yeah I I (11:37 - 11:42)

like Kirby and velocity (12:37 - 12:41)
um by Nintendo and uh Hal laboratory (12:39 - 12:43)
special award want to know one (12:41 - 12:45)
apparently and then finally special this (12:43 - 12:48)
year the grand prize went to Eldon ring (12:45 - 12:51)
from from software welcome to the grand (12:48 - 12:54)
prize winner (12:51 - 12:54)
uh (12:54 - 12:57)
so (12:59 - 13:04)
somehow so now that I've read all of (13:01 - 13:06)
this per my Google translate there there (13:04 - 13:08)
is some some issues with how Google (13:06 - 13:12)
translate worked uh somehow (13:08 - 13:14)
people did what I did they Google (13:12 - 13:16)
translate and then they tweeted out that (13:14 - 13:18)
it was ridiculous that Pokemon brilliant (13:16 - 13:21)
Diamond shining World won the best game (13:18 - 13:25)
of the year from TGs and that uh it (13:21 - 13:28)
should have went to Legends Arceus (13:25 - 13:31)
now if I if I scroll to the top of the (13:28 - 13:34)
article Google translate the first (13:31 - 13:36)
sentence of the headline of the article (13:34 - 13:39)
says L didn't ring one grand prize yeah (13:36 - 13:43)
that's yeah pretty clear (13:39 - 13:46)
even even with the expert translations (13:43 - 13:49)
of Google people cannot have reading (13:46 - 13:52)
comprehension (13:49 - 13:54)
um so there are three Pokemon games here (13:52 - 13:56)
there are there are the excellent Awards (13:54 - 13:58)
which Pokemon Legends Arceus one it was (13:56 - 14:00)
one of the 10 games I read that won the (13:58 - 14:03)
the excellent award (14:00 - 14:04)
um brilliant Diamond shining pearls now (14:03 - 14:09)
on that list uh best sales Awards uh (14:04 - 14:11)
brilliant Diamond shining Pearl sold two (14:09 - 14:14)
million more copies than (14:11 - 14:17)
uh Legends it was (14:14 - 14:19)
out two months before Legends also had (14:17 - 14:22)
two versions of that game (14:19 - 14:25)
um so I mean there's no debate with that (14:22 - 14:28)
award what game sold a lot brilliant (14:25 - 14:32)
Diamond shining Pearl past sales best (14:28 - 14:35)
sales so the one that I think people got (14:32 - 14:37)
mixed up of like game of the year or (14:35 - 14:39)
best game is global award Japanese work (14:37 - 14:41)
category this is actually really badly (14:39 - 14:43)
translated (14:41 - 14:46)
um man that makes sense to me I I (14:43 - 14:49)
verified I I hit my sources I talked to (14:46 - 14:52)
Mr Joe Serebii uh Joe Merrick of (14:49 - 14:55)
serebii.net just to verify and and he's (14:52 - 14:56)
he thought it was the same thing I (14:55 - 14:59)
thought what this award is is it is it (14:56 - 15:03)
is an award for a Japanese developer (14:59 - 15:07)
making a game that sold incredibly well (15:03 - 15:11)
outside of Japan that's all it is it is (15:07 - 15:15)
this is one of the best-selling (15:11 - 15:17)
japanese-made games (15:15 - 15:20)
outside of the country of Japan that's (15:17 - 15:23)
it that's what it says Global award (15:20 - 15:25)
Japanese work (15:23 - 15:28)
I don't understand how that is confusing (15:25 - 15:31)
so these right below it is global prize (15:28 - 15:32)
foreign work (15:31 - 15:36)
but it's the same work (15:32 - 15:36)
so the two awards given to brilliant (15:36 - 15:43)
Diamond shining Pearl are purely based (15:40 - 15:45)
off sales not the quality of the game (15:43 - 15:47)
that's it (15:45 - 15:49)
it's sold a lot of copies we can't argue (15:47 - 15:53)
with that we can also argue that the (15:49 - 15:56)
game that sells the most is indeed the (15:53 - 15:59)
best game (15:56 - 16:02)
I mean it depends on how you define best (15:59 - 16:03)
right (16:02 - 16:06)
best seller yes best seller best game (16:03 - 16:09)
best quality also yes for brilliant (16:06 - 16:12)
Diamond shining Pearl (16:09 - 16:12)
um I don't think there's any debate that (16:13 - 16:16)
Elden ring is a very good game and I (16:14 - 16:17)
don't know one game of the year so (16:16 - 16:20)
that's that's um I am going to pick (16:17 - 16:23)
apart your sourcing though because I (16:20 - 16:25)
believe uh Serebii did not know about (16:23 - 16:29)
zapping the ROM to reset shinies (16:25 - 16:31)
that's true that's true they didn't know (16:29 - 16:33)
yeah that's uh the very let's go Pikachu (16:31 - 16:36)
let's go Eevee controversy (16:33 - 16:40)
so let's uh dial back our assuredness (16:36 - 16:42)
yeah you know it's it's always (16:40 - 16:45)
frustrating and I I (16:42 - 16:48)
you know this isn't this is you know uh (16:45 - 16:50)
misinformation around Pokemon news is (16:48 - 16:53)
that exclusive to Pokemon news (16:50 - 16:53)
have the amount of misinformation that (16:59 - 17:05)
other Phantoms get into uh but to see (17:02 - 17:06)
the tweets saying I can't believe (17:05 - 17:09)
brilliant Diamond shining Pearl won best (17:06 - 17:11)
game of the year and legends Arceus (17:09 - 17:13)
didn't when (17:11 - 17:16)
anyone could have clicked this source (17:13 - 17:19)
and then Google translated themselves (17:16 - 17:21)
and I feel like even with him Greg is (17:19 - 17:23)
right even without like verifying with (17:21 - 17:25)
cerebii one says Global Japanese award (17:23 - 17:28)
work category and this is Japanese (17:25 - 17:31)
developer foreign (17:28 - 17:31)
American developer (17:32 - 17:36)
Call of Duty does sell very well (17:38 - 17:43)
worldwide and it is made by an American (17:40 - 17:45)
developer (17:43 - 17:47)
a lot of people in the world are called (17:45 - 17:49)
to duty (17:47 - 17:52)
that's right so um yes Berlin Diamond (17:49 - 17:54)
shining Pearl did win two Awards both (17:52 - 17:56)
awards were based off of sales and sales (17:54 - 17:58)
alone not the quality of the game uh (17:56 - 18:01)
Legends Arceus did win an excellent (17:58 - 18:04)
award it was one of 10 games that did (18:01 - 18:06)
win an excellent Awards brilliant (18:04 - 18:07)
Diamond Charney Pearl did not win an (18:06 - 18:08)
excellent award (18:07 - 18:11)
um that that's pretty much the news so (18:08 - 18:14)
uh I think I think we cleared up the (18:11 - 18:18)
uh TGs stuff so (18:14 - 18:22)
hopefully you're welcome (18:18 - 18:22)
now what I'm gonna (18:22 - 18:25)
be dodrio coming to Pokemon Unite they (18:27 - 18:32)
already messed it up (18:29 - 18:34)
they had to did they not give it enough (18:32 - 18:37)
heads no that has all three heads it has (18:34 - 18:40)
all three heads um (18:37 - 18:42)
dodrio is sprinting over to EOS islands (18:40 - 18:43)
and getting ready to join your team in (18:42 - 18:45)
Pokemon Unite with powerful beak attacks (18:43 - 18:47)
and unique scoring ability the Speedster (18:45 - 18:49)
for Speedster since the game has been (18:47 - 18:50)
released (18:49 - 18:52)
proves that three heads are better than (18:50 - 18:56)
one you can get no drill for 14 (18:52 - 19:00)
000 EOS coins or 575 AOS gems in the (18:56 - 19:02)
battle committee shop that's technically (19:00 - 19:05)
true technically not true uh read more (19:02 - 19:07)
about it below uh that's technically not (19:05 - 19:08)
true because they're doing this weird (19:07 - 19:09)
thing where they're saying like you (19:08 - 19:12)
cannot use coins for a full week you (19:09 - 19:13)
must give us real money (19:12 - 19:17)
uh if you want dodrio now uh if you (19:13 - 19:19)
don't want to give us real money you can (19:17 - 19:20)
give us coins (19:19 - 19:23)
but not until not until later yeah in a (19:20 - 19:25)
week (19:23 - 19:27)
I mean I've heard this story before you (19:25 - 19:29)
guys said the same time it was all this (19:27 - 19:31)
time (19:29 - 19:33)
what's really cool here uh at the bottom (19:31 - 19:35)
it says meta game watch and it says that (19:33 - 19:38)
dodrio is strong against decidueye weak (19:35 - 19:41)
against Snorlax (19:38 - 19:41)
I guess that would be true right because (19:41 - 19:44)
like for decidui you want to get really (19:43 - 19:47)
close (19:44 - 19:47)
I was like dodrio is fast oh dodrio (19:47 - 19:53)
lives up to the Speedster name (19:51 - 19:57)
that that boy is zooming (19:53 - 19:59)
and it has to keep zooming which is (19:57 - 20:01)
interesting because if you stop you lose (19:59 - 20:03)
your Zoom gauge (20:01 - 20:06)
and then you move slow so you have to (20:03 - 20:08)
constantly be running around (20:06 - 20:11)
but they already they already (20:08 - 20:13)
well one could argue that they messed it (20:11 - 20:15)
up the first time and they correct it (20:13 - 20:16)
but people are arguing that it was fine (20:15 - 20:19)
the first time and then they they messed (20:16 - 20:20)
it up (20:19 - 20:22)
because (20:20 - 20:24)
you know about you do y'all know about (20:22 - 20:28)
Stacks when people say stat what Stacks (20:24 - 20:30)
are stacks of cash that's what I know (20:28 - 20:33)
heck yeah (20:30 - 20:33)
so there's two items well there's (20:35 - 20:39)
there's a bunch of items but the two (20:38 - 20:42)
important ones are the EOS cookie and (20:39 - 20:45)
the attack weight that every time you (20:42 - 20:49)
score it creates a stack of the stat (20:45 - 20:53)
that improves and they cap out at six (20:49 - 20:54)
and when just working on the main games (20:53 - 20:57)
yeah so when the dodrio was first (20:54 - 20:59)
released (20:57 - 21:02)
when you'd score it would divide your (20:59 - 21:06)
score up into three and so in one hit (21:02 - 21:09)
you would stack three times so you only (21:06 - 21:11)
had to do that twice because it would do (21:09 - 21:13)
it once for each head so errors like (21:11 - 21:15)
this is the greatest stacker that has (21:13 - 21:18)
ever lived because (21:15 - 21:20)
Within (21:18 - 21:22)
the first 30 seconds of the game you can (21:20 - 21:24)
have full Stacks from health and full (21:22 - 21:27)
stacks of attack and it was tearing (21:24 - 21:28)
everything up (21:27 - 21:31)
so then they did a hot fix (21:28 - 21:34)
uh I think it was on Friday where it was (21:31 - 21:39)
like oh nope now the stack only account (21:34 - 21:43)
counts on the last (21:39 - 21:45)
head score (21:43 - 21:49)
so it breaks the score up into three so (21:45 - 21:50)
it doesn't count the first it doesn't (21:49 - 21:53)
count the second it only counts the (21:50 - 21:56)
third for when it puts the stack on the (21:53 - 21:58)
attack weight or the as cookie that (21:56 - 21:59)
makes sense (21:58 - 22:01)
the problem is (21:59 - 22:04)
if you shatter the goal on the first or (22:01 - 22:05)
the second (22:04 - 22:07)
you don't get your stack (22:05 - 22:08)
um (22:07 - 22:09)
I guess that makes sense (22:08 - 22:12)
so people are (22:09 - 22:15)
now off the dodea street like (22:12 - 22:16)
everybody's stopped playing dodrio (22:15 - 22:18)
because now it's useless even though it (22:16 - 22:21)
can cover literally everywhere on the (22:18 - 22:24)
map at full speed now that it can't (22:21 - 22:27)
stack in the first 30 seconds I think (22:24 - 22:30)
this is dropped I think dodrio is still (22:27 - 22:33)
useful because uh it's very useful when (22:30 - 22:35)
it's dunking and you're dunking with it (22:33 - 22:39)
I mean like you're getting that (22:35 - 22:41)
I I don't know I still think I still (22:39 - 22:43)
think he's pretty good yeah it's still (22:41 - 22:45)
it stood it's just that it was that what (22:43 - 22:47)
made it so appealing and people were (22:45 - 22:48)
spending (22:47 - 22:51)
actual money on was that it was (22:48 - 22:56)
op broken that first five days (22:51 - 22:58)
um the two things I want to talk about (22:56 - 23:00)
here not as I guess we could go in depth (22:58 - 23:03)
with characters but that's not really (23:00 - 23:06)
yeah meta changes so much anyways uh the (23:03 - 23:08)
the thing I want to go the two things I (23:06 - 23:11)
want to mention here is the the power (23:08 - 23:14)
the the money creep of EOS gems they're (23:11 - 23:15)
charging for characters is kind of (23:14 - 23:17)
getting out of hand yeah I remember when (23:15 - 23:19)
the most expensive character was 10 000 (23:17 - 23:22)
AOS gems some characters were 8 000 gems (23:19 - 23:24)
I think some I think Charizard is like (23:22 - 23:25)
six thousand AOS Gems or something like (23:24 - 23:26)
that (23:25 - 23:29)
coins sorry coins coins coins coins (23:26 - 23:31)
um uh (23:29 - 23:35)
but now they're just pushing the line of (23:31 - 23:38)
like what was it Tyranitar or Buzz well (23:35 - 23:40)
that was like the first one's over like (23:38 - 23:42)
twelve thousand Tyranitar was the first (23:40 - 23:45)
one over Tyranitar was 14 and this is (23:42 - 23:48)
14. and Buzz I think was 12 or maybe (23:45 - 23:51)
Buzz was 12. (23:48 - 23:54)
and it's just a lot of coins (23:51 - 23:57)
we gotta compensate for a supply chain (23:54 - 24:00)
and inflation and the recession and (23:57 - 24:02)
interest rates all that (24:00 - 24:04)
it's true the other thing is they did (24:02 - 24:06)
like uh uh I felt like no one talked (24:04 - 24:08)
about this where they did like a hotfix (24:06 - 24:10)
where they removed the not twos from the (24:08 - 24:12)
map and then added a second Berry back (24:10 - 24:15)
because the new map only had one Barry (24:12 - 24:16)
and then all of a sudden all the nattus (24:15 - 24:17)
were gone and then another Berry (24:16 - 24:20)
appeared so they when they did the (24:17 - 24:22)
hotfix for dodrio they they (24:20 - 24:24)
changed I don't know if they people some (24:22 - 24:26)
say they fixed it some people say they (24:24 - 24:28)
didn't but there used to be three not (24:26 - 24:29)
twos (24:28 - 24:33)
on both sides of the top of the Top Lane (24:29 - 24:35)
and now they've changed it back to just (24:33 - 24:38)
one Bunnelby (24:35 - 24:39)
um (24:38 - 24:41)
I don't know (24:39 - 24:43)
why (24:41 - 24:45)
so no natsus at all (24:43 - 24:48)
no not twos at all (24:45 - 24:48)
I feel like certain Pokemon just always (24:50 - 24:54)
got not to no matter what like cramerant (24:52 - 24:56)
got all three nattus no you can contest (24:54 - 24:58)
it yeah because (24:56 - 25:02)
probably why they did it (24:58 - 25:05)
yeah I just know it was that big of a (25:02 - 25:07)
deal because it they only counted for (25:05 - 25:10)
three but I think it's because they were (25:07 - 25:12)
individual Pokemon that it messed up the (25:10 - 25:14)
XP (25:12 - 25:16)
because instead of getting XP for one (25:14 - 25:19)
you're getting XP for three (25:16 - 25:21)
which I think had changed the XP skirt (25:19 - 25:23)
curve as far as leveling for Pokemon (25:21 - 25:26)
which was a problem so I think I can (25:23 - 25:30)
think of is why they would have fixed it (25:26 - 25:30)
my thought process was like certain (25:30 - 25:34)
Pokemon just always got it no matter (25:33 - 25:37)
what and (25:34 - 25:37)
you couldn't stop it (25:37 - 25:42)
I mean (25:40 - 25:46)
yeah it's hard to say I I (25:42 - 25:48)
I don't know they didn't really say why (25:46 - 25:50)
they fixed it so we're all just like (25:48 - 25:53)
okay it's different (25:50 - 25:53)
um (25:53 - 25:55)
second Berry being back felt better yeah (25:55 - 26:00)
uh speaking of other games Rosa's (26:01 - 26:05)
special costume and Shaman comes to (26:03 - 26:08)
Pokemon Masters ex Rosa is once again (26:05 - 26:10)
ready to battle what is this like the (26:08 - 26:11)
fourth Rosa (26:10 - 26:15)
um in Pokemon Masters ex uh complete (26:11 - 26:16)
with a stylish new costume and a sink (26:15 - 26:18)
pair partner the mythical Pokemon Shaman (26:16 - 26:21)
the grass type sync pair excels at (26:18 - 26:23)
altering stats both their own and their (26:21 - 26:25)
opponents their seed flare move can (26:23 - 26:27)
lower the target special defense in (26:25 - 26:28)
addition to dealing damage priming (26:27 - 26:30)
Rosa's special costume and Shaman to (26:28 - 26:32)
make the best of their sync move grass (26:30 - 26:34)
beam of gratitude (26:32 - 26:36)
which grows in the power which grows in (26:34 - 26:38)
power the more the target's special (26:36 - 26:40)
defense is lowered Rosa will be (26:38 - 26:43)
available until until September 30th (26:40 - 26:44)
um (26:43 - 26:47)
and then they just have her uh (26:44 - 26:50)
skills listed and then they're saying (26:47 - 26:52)
they recommend Rosa and Shaman to be (26:50 - 26:54)
paired with Cigna suit Elsa and Rotom (26:52 - 26:59)
Giovanni and Mewtwo and getsis and kirim (26:54 - 26:59)
that's what they say not me but (27:01 - 27:06)
fine pairings fine flavorful pairings (27:03 - 27:09)
the most fine pairings (27:06 - 27:11)
you know what I'm annoyed about (27:09 - 27:16)
that she looks like Nurse Joy no oh okay (27:11 - 27:18)
so you do the special event and you get (27:16 - 27:20)
a (27:18 - 27:22)
free NPC (27:20 - 27:25)
a character they've made (27:22 - 27:29)
just made up for this one thing (27:25 - 27:32)
and there is still no mirror B in this (27:29 - 27:37)
game we get an NPC an NPC (27:32 - 27:37)
before we get mirror B are we starting (27:37 - 27:40)
to believe that maybe they're (27:39 - 27:43)
embarrassed about mirror b i I don't (27:40 - 27:46)
know how or why they're just waiting for (27:43 - 27:47)
the fourth year anniversary (27:46 - 27:50)

game right yeah there's my little cardo (27:59 - 28:03)
then it's going to be sick no suit (28:01 - 28:07)
mirror B with bucephalon (28:03 - 28:07)
your dating simulator going (28:12 - 28:15)
I'm okay I'm really mad at Lily right (28:16 - 28:21)
now and I can't even talk about it (28:19 - 28:23)
because (28:21 - 28:23)
I (28:23 - 28:29)
I give and I give and I give I ask the (28:25 - 28:31)
things I say how are you I want to know (28:29 - 28:34)
what you're interested in I pick those (28:31 - 28:36)
options and after like four questions (28:34 - 28:38)
she's like thanks that was fun like we (28:36 - 28:39)

16. maybe but it's an old soul maybe (29:00 - 29:06)
maybe you're just going wrong but you're (29:04 - 29:07)
going about the conversing with her a (29:06 - 29:10)
little wrong you know what works on (29:07 - 29:12)

okay bye (29:21 - 29:25)
why did it even choose you and okay the (29:23 - 29:27)
one thing that makes me laugh though (29:25 - 29:29)
have you done Expeditions a lot we're (29:27 - 29:30)
just they're just wandering out in a (29:29 - 29:33)
field I have sent them on Expeditions (29:30 - 29:34)
and I've collected rewards I don't think (29:33 - 29:36)
I've actually like watched them walk (29:34 - 29:39)
around so every once in a while one of (29:36 - 29:41)
them will get a thing above their heads (29:39 - 29:43)
that says cheer everybody on (29:41 - 29:45)
okay and in my second group (29:43 - 29:49)
it's always Giovanni and I cannot (29:45 - 29:52)
get over the cognizant dissidents of (29:49 - 29:55)
imagining Giovanni in a group of Gym (29:52 - 29:57)
Leaders cheering them on to find things (29:55 - 29:59)
better and he's just wandering around (29:57 - 30:02)
looking grumpy to hit the cheer button (29:59 - 30:03)
and he gets the smile for two seconds (30:02 - 30:06)
I'm like nobody in this field is happy (30:03 - 30:09)
with this person yelling at them this is (30:06 - 30:11)

appear at level 100 with a timid nature (30:57 - 31:01)
and pressure it will know the moves (30:59 - 31:03)
Dynamax Canon Eterna beam sludge bomb (31:01 - 31:06)
and flamethrower (31:03 - 31:10)
nope no purchase is required to receive (31:06 - 31:12)
a code card but the offer will only uh (31:10 - 31:14)
last (31:12 - 31:15)
the offer is only available while (31:14 - 31:17)
supplies last so don't delay head over (31:15 - 31:20)
to GameStop in the US or Canada (31:17 - 31:22)
so this uh there again there was there (31:20 - 31:24)
was debate about this because I think (31:22 - 31:28)
the Pokemon Facebook page the official (31:24 - 31:30)
Pokemon Facebook's page said like go get (31:28 - 31:34)
your Alternatives while you pre-order uh (31:30 - 31:36)
scarlet and violet and then people were (31:34 - 31:37)
like does this mean you have to (31:36 - 31:39)
pre-order (31:37 - 31:41)
um you don't it says right here no (31:39 - 31:43)
purchase is required to receive the code (31:41 - 31:44)
card that's how it's always been (31:43 - 31:47)
hopefully that's how it always will be I (31:44 - 31:49)
will say that I will always always say (31:47 - 31:50)
this every time we talk about (31:49 - 31:52)
distribution if your GameStop is trying (31:50 - 31:54)
to charge you if they're saying You must (31:52 - 31:57)
buy a Pokemon item you must pre-order uh (31:54 - 31:59)
you must buy our membership to get this (31:57 - 32:01)
that is wrong wrong wrong wrong (31:59 - 32:04)
none of these have ever cost money you (32:01 - 32:07)
can just walk in ask for a code card get (32:04 - 32:09)
your code card walk out technically it (32:07 - 32:12)
is one code card per person (32:09 - 32:16)
um if the the GameStop employee is on a (32:12 - 32:18)
power trip and they want to live by that (32:16 - 32:20)
rule that's fine just take the one code (32:18 - 32:24)
card let them don't don't as hopefully (32:20 - 32:25)
they don't try to charge you because (32:24 - 32:28)
that would be bad that would be that (32:25 - 32:30)
sucks but also don't haggle them they (32:28 - 32:34)
have a pretty terrible job sometimes too (32:30 - 32:36)
just take your one code card and leave (32:34 - 32:38)
come back to like in a week get another (32:36 - 32:39)
one it's fine (32:38 - 32:41)
um I've never had a problem with getting (32:39 - 32:43)
two personally I usually go in and say (32:41 - 32:45)
hey can I just get two and they just (32:43 - 32:48)
hand it to me I walk out but (32:45 - 32:50)
um (32:48 - 32:53)
there's your (32:50 - 32:56)
there's there's your hassle (32:53 - 32:56)
when people say I wish I could shiny (32:57 - 33:01)
hunt this instead of getting a code card (32:59 - 33:03)
I I don't know I feel like going to (33:01 - 33:05)
GameStop is actually a challenge like I (33:03 - 33:07)
feel like like I'm kind of dreading it (33:05 - 33:09)
already (33:07 - 33:09)
uh maybe yeah maybe I agree with them (33:10 - 33:14)
maybe I wish I could just turn my game (33:12 - 33:15)
off over and over because man (33:14 - 33:17)
interacting with GameStop employees is (33:15 - 33:20)
the last thing I want to do (33:17 - 33:23)
well there's one by a taco Libre so that (33:20 - 33:25)
always helps (33:23 - 33:25)
um so that starts today uh (33:27 - 33:32)
it says that it ends on October 1st (33:30 - 33:35)
that's just when Gamestop will not have (33:32 - 33:36)
codes anymore I mean they could run out (33:35 - 33:39)
sooner uh but usually you can redeem it (33:36 - 33:40)
well after the date (33:39 - 33:43)
what (33:40 - 33:43)
spoiler (33:44 - 33:48)
check the dumpsters after the end date (33:46 - 33:49)
because maybe they throw all the card (33:48 - 33:52)
cards out and you can dumpster dive your (33:49 - 33:54)
way to a number of shiny eternities (33:52 - 33:58)
uh we we talked about last week how uh (33:54 - 34:02)
the UK or sorry Europe has the (33:58 - 34:06)
marshadow Volcanion Genesect (34:02 - 34:08)
um I believe they probably I don't I (34:06 - 34:12)
don't have anywhere in front of me of (34:08 - 34:15)
what stores they are supposed to get (34:12 - 34:19)
this or if they're getting this as well (34:15 - 34:21)
um but it would probably be it would (34:19 - 34:23)
probably it's always the same stores in (34:21 - 34:25)
in Europe that's the thing it's it's (34:23 - 34:28)
always like micromania it's always game (34:25 - 34:30)
it's always uh what's that I can't (34:28 - 34:32)
remember the third one it's always those (34:30 - 34:34)
Stars there's a GameStop (34:32 - 34:38)
they do have GameStops what's the game (34:35 - 34:40)
game of mania that's the third one Game (34:38 - 34:44)
Mania micromania gay Mania game what (34:40 - 34:47)
about babbages what about EB Games nah (34:44 - 34:49)
they're gone KB Toys (34:47 - 34:54)
uh and I I believe that there was some (34:50 - 34:56)
Asian countries that got that they're (34:54 - 34:58)
starting on the 16th I know Toys R Us (34:56 - 35:01)
was one I know GameStop was one uh (34:58 - 35:03)
Serebii had a whole list of like (35:01 - 35:04)
Singapore where you could you could go (35:03 - 35:06)
to like 30 different stores in like (35:04 - 35:09)
Singapore to get it uh (35:06 - 35:11)
Australia New Zealand I know we they (35:09 - 35:13)
always get missed EB Games (35:11 - 35:17)
um if you're in Brazil (35:13 - 35:17)
I think you're used to not getting these (35:19 - 35:24)
um but these codes here's the thing (35:22 - 35:27)
though these codes work anywhere uh so (35:24 - 35:29)
if you are in a country that didn't get (35:27 - 35:32)
one of these codes (35:29 - 35:32)
and you have anyone you know in America (35:33 - 35:39)
they can they can pick you up a code and (35:36 - 35:41)
scratch it off and send you the code or (35:39 - 35:42)
send you a picture of the code it will (35:41 - 35:44)
work their one-time use codes (35:42 - 35:46)
so that's why you might want to grab two (35:44 - 35:48)
when you go to GameStop one for you one (35:46 - 35:49)
for a friend (35:48 - 35:51)
if if you're American you want that (35:49 - 35:53)
marshadow (35:51 - 35:58)
uh Genesect Volcanion and I don't know (35:53 - 36:00)
the the your European friends cannot (35:58 - 36:02)
find a code maybe offered a trade (36:00 - 36:04)
get me an extra marshadow code I'll get (36:02 - 36:06)
you an extra Alternatives code (36:04 - 36:08)
you got look you got like two weeks to (36:06 - 36:09)
figure it out (36:08 - 36:12)
it's it's (36:09 - 36:12)
you know do it to it (36:12 - 36:17)
uh the other thing I wanted to mention (36:15 - 36:19)
real quick before the break uh is (36:17 - 36:24)
speaking of codes uh that the at this (36:19 - 36:26)
point all of Ash's Pokemon (36:24 - 36:29)
for the anime should have been released (36:26 - 36:32)
the last one being Lucario (36:29 - 36:34)
um now you might say like Steve they (36:32 - 36:36)
have only done five codes where's the (36:34 - 36:39)
Pikachu (36:36 - 36:39)
I don't know if we're getting Pikachu (36:39 - 36:45)
uh Pikachu was given out at the 25th (36:42 - 36:47)
anniversary (36:45 - 36:48)
movie festival (36:47 - 36:50)
which (36:48 - 36:52)
was delayed because of covid I believe (36:50 - 36:54)
that's why it's 25th anniversary and (36:52 - 36:57)
it's technically the 26th uh that was (36:54 - 37:00)
given out there to people who purchased (36:57 - 37:02)
the ticket to that festival and on that (37:00 - 37:05)
ticket you would get Ash's Pikachu in (37:02 - 37:09)
the anime and you also got a Jirachi (37:05 - 37:11)
and I don't know what you did at this (37:09 - 37:15)
Festival I I don't know what movie I we (37:11 - 37:16)
were you were watching I don't know I (37:15 - 37:18)
don't have the details of that but as of (37:16 - 37:20)
this recording you could still get sir (37:18 - 37:23)
Fetch and the last one that got released (37:20 - 37:25)
was Lucario so you have about 10 more (37:23 - 37:26)
days to get Lucario because most of (37:25 - 37:28)
these codes were two weeks Gengar (37:26 - 37:31)
expired dracovish expired (37:28 - 37:34)
um Dragon Knight expired (37:31 - 37:39)
and it maybe we everyone gets Pikachu I (37:34 - 37:41)
don't think so (37:39 - 37:43)
but also (37:41 - 37:46)
don't know I don't know why they would (37:43 - 37:48)
release Pikachu since this whole (37:46 - 37:52)
promotion was based off of the (37:48 - 37:55)
where they are the Japanese anime which (37:52 - 37:57)
is the Masters eight which is giving (37:55 - 38:02)
Ash's team a way to celebrate (37:57 - 38:04)
the Masters eight battles I don't want (38:02 - 38:06)
to spoil any of that for people well I (38:04 - 38:08)
guess now you know Ash's team if you've (38:06 - 38:10)
been collecting these codes I mean it's (38:08 - 38:12)
been a team that he's been using for a (38:10 - 38:14)
while so yeah I don't think he's had (38:12 - 38:16)
like a seventh or eighth that he's like (38:14 - 38:17)
switched out this has just kind of been (38:16 - 38:19)
a steam (38:17 - 38:19)
um and know that Lucario cannot mega (38:21 - 38:24)
evolve (38:23 - 38:26)
d (38:24 - 38:26)
although I think it is funny that the (38:27 - 38:31)
Lucario has the ability inner Focus (38:29 - 38:33)
which means it can't Flinch and in one (38:31 - 38:35)
of the battles (38:33 - 38:37)
he got flinched multiple times with that (38:35 - 38:39)
Lucario so (38:37 - 38:42)
yeah you know (38:39 - 38:44)
not exactly you know the most accurate (38:42 - 38:47)
but you know take what you can get (38:44 - 38:49)
um (38:47 - 38:49)
uh okay I I think that's uh the first (38:49 - 38:54)
part of news here uh what we'll do is (38:52 - 38:55)
we'll take a quick break we have a (38:54 - 38:57)
little bit more we have a little bit (38:55 - 39:00)
more news and some more misinformation (38:57 - 39:03)
to clear up uh and so we will be right (39:00 - 39:08)
back and we are back from our break (39:03 - 39:11)
okay so so this news happened this (39:08 - 39:14)
morning and I was tagged in it and (39:11 - 39:17)
um uh let's be clear (39:14 - 39:20)
all three of us were tagged in one way (39:17 - 39:22)
or another true that's true it's not (39:20 - 39:26)
just you that's the waves I was tagged (39:22 - 39:28)
in slack I was tagged on Twitter (39:26 - 39:30)
um (39:28 - 39:33)
so (39:30 - 39:33)
I I guess I guess I'll read the the the (39:33 - 39:38)
Tweet here and then I'll explain what's (39:36 - 39:40)
happening for people who don't want to (39:38 - 39:43)
click it uh there was a content creator (39:40 - 39:45)
that tweeted the Pokemon company thinks (39:43 - 39:48)
nuzlocke's uh are on the same level of (39:45 - 39:50)
rom hack according to former Nintendo (39:48 - 39:52)
employees and then shows a one minute (39:50 - 39:55)
clip of two former Nintendo employees (39:52 - 39:58)
talking about this so if you guys don't (39:55 - 39:59)
know (39:58 - 40:03)
um there is kit and Krista they used to (39:59 - 40:06)
work for Nintendo (40:03 - 40:09)
um they left Nintendo uh a couple months (40:06 - 40:11)
ago and then they started their own (40:09 - 40:13)
Nintendo podcast (40:11 - 40:17)
talking about like their their history (40:13 - 40:20)
with working at Nintendo I think uh kit (40:17 - 40:21)
worked for Nintendo for almost 10 years (40:20 - 40:25)
uh and I think Krista for like eight (40:21 - 40:26)
and if you guys don't remember what (40:25 - 40:29)
Nintendo Minute was uh kit and Krista it (40:26 - 40:32)
was it was pretty much (40:29 - 40:33)
um like a YouTube show that would (40:32 - 40:38)
showcase off new games in a more (40:33 - 40:40)
non-sterile way I guess because they're (40:38 - 40:41)
still Nintendo employees and they're (40:40 - 40:43)
still like keeping to Nintendo (40:41 - 40:45)
guidelines but it was a really a way to (40:43 - 40:46)
like (40:45 - 40:48)
interact with a bigger audience that (40:46 - 40:50)
wasn't like I they want to watch (40:48 - 40:52)
personalities but they're watching (40:50 - 40:54)
personalities approved and curated by (40:52 - 40:56)
Nintendo (40:54 - 40:57)
um (40:56 - 40:59)
I have never heard anyone disliking kit (40:57 - 41:01)
and Krista uh they also went to like a (40:59 - 41:03)
lot of e3s and a lot of taxes and did a (41:01 - 41:05)
lot of Nintendo stuff there like Greg (41:03 - 41:07)
and I went to a Nintendo (41:05 - 41:10)
Nintendo invited us to a thing at Pax (41:07 - 41:12)
West and kitten Crystal were there and (41:10 - 41:15)
they did a live Nintendo Minute (41:12 - 41:18)
um I have a hat I brought a hat (41:15 - 41:21)
I yes I have that hat again nothing I (41:18 - 41:22)
don't think is ever and I don't think (41:21 - 41:24)
anyone has ever had a problem with (41:22 - 41:25)
kitten Krista I think they were (41:24 - 41:27)
universally very very well liked and (41:25 - 41:30)
Nintendo Minute was very well liked by a (41:27 - 41:31)
lot of people (41:30 - 41:34)
the reason I believe from what I recall (41:31 - 41:35)
from listening to their podcast the (41:34 - 41:38)
reason they left Nintendo was pretty (41:35 - 41:40)
much they were offered to they they they (41:38 - 41:42)
said that Nintendo said they had to (41:40 - 41:43)
relocate (41:42 - 41:48)
uh oh nope and so in order to keep their (41:43 - 41:50)
jobs they could either relocate (41:48 - 41:54)
uh or they could find another job and (41:50 - 41:56)
they both wanted they both liked where (41:54 - 41:58)
they lived they both liked their life (41:56 - 42:01)
they kit went I believe kit went on to (41:58 - 42:03)
say like I can't really go up anywhere (42:01 - 42:06)
Nintendo I don't want to be a manager (42:03 - 42:08)
um I like where I'm at but I also don't (42:06 - 42:11)
want to relocate so they left (42:08 - 42:13)
um which I mean like yeah I mean what (42:11 - 42:15)
I've I've definitely been there with (42:13 - 42:17)
other jobs I've like I've been here for (42:15 - 42:20)
five years I don't want to be a manager (42:17 - 42:22)
what do I do (42:20 - 42:24)
you do what I do for the last 36 I don't (42:22 - 42:26)
want to be a manager and I've just (42:24 - 42:28)
stayed doing my job for 26 years you (42:26 - 42:31)
could do what I did and heck you'd be (42:28 - 42:33)
more even more than a manager and then (42:31 - 42:35)
step down to the lowest possible (42:33 - 42:37)
position possible (42:35 - 42:40)
work your wage (42:37 - 42:43)
um so so in the clip uh kit and Crystal (42:40 - 42:45)
talk about how they were pitching new (42:43 - 42:48)
ideas for Nintendo Minute and how one of (42:45 - 42:50)
the ideals they wanted to do was a (42:48 - 42:51)
Nuzlocke (42:50 - 42:55)
and uh Nintendo (42:51 - 42:58)
or uh Nintendo or the Pokemon company (42:55 - 43:00)
slash Nintendo were like no (42:58 - 43:04)
uh that's that's like ROM hacks we don't (43:00 - 43:06)
want to encourage that (43:04 - 43:09)
and so of course that tweet blew up (43:06 - 43:10)
um (43:09 - 43:13)
and (43:10 - 43:13)
uh the the content creator that tweeted (43:13 - 43:18)
it said creators that didn't work for (43:16 - 43:19)
Nintendo weren't getting blast (43:18 - 43:22)
blacklisted for doing just nuzlocks (43:19 - 43:23)
you'd have to be doing a randomizer or (43:22 - 43:25)
something with it the Pokemon company (43:23 - 43:27)
probably didn't know a regular nose lock (43:25 - 43:29)
was just self-impelled imposed rules on (43:27 - 43:31)
a regular game (43:29 - 43:32)
um (43:31 - 43:35)
the the tweet that I have here also (43:32 - 43:36)
because obviously that was the initial (43:35 - 43:39)
tweet I was tagged in was was that one (43:36 - 43:41)
is the (43:39 - 43:46)
is the Tweet by Sarah B which uh Joe Mr (43:41 - 43:49)
Serebii uh said I've I've spoken to the (43:46 - 43:51)
Pokemon company about this they (43:49 - 43:53)
confirmed to me that this is incorrect (43:51 - 43:55)
they haven't cut out people for doing (43:53 - 43:57)
nuzlocks or anything like that they (43:55 - 43:59)
don't care as long as you follow what (43:57 - 44:01)
confine as long as you follow the rules (43:59 - 44:03)
that what's confined impossible the (44:01 - 44:06)
possibilities of the game (44:03 - 44:06)
like nothing in the game is stopping you (44:06 - 44:11)
from using a level 100 Totodile if you (44:09 - 44:13)
refuse to evolve your Totodile and just (44:11 - 44:17)
power that bad boy up right (44:13 - 44:17)
um uh Joe says I doubt uh Joe says to (44:18 - 44:24)
clarify further since my words are being (44:21 - 44:25)
misconstrued I'm not saying they're (44:24 - 44:27)
lying what I'm saying happened was a (44:25 - 44:30)
miscommunication the Pokemon company's (44:27 - 44:33)
stance uh is what I said above has been (44:30 - 44:34)
that for a long time (44:33 - 44:36)
I can also confirm this though and I I (44:34 - 44:39)
did tweet to Joe I I have talked to the (44:36 - 44:41)
Pokemon company a lot especially with (44:39 - 44:44)
the uh you know being at their offices (44:41 - 44:47)
in in Seattle for go Fest and (44:44 - 44:49)
um you know them inviting me out to (44:47 - 44:52)
London I I straight up asked the Pokemon (44:49 - 44:55)
company a lot of questions I was like (44:52 - 44:59)
uh and you know I when I talk to them (44:55 - 45:00)
they also had no problem with nuzlocks (44:59 - 45:02)
the thing that the Pokemon company does (45:00 - 45:04)
have a problem with (45:02 - 45:06)
um and this is not only the Pokemon (45:04 - 45:09)
company but Nintendo in a hole is they (45:06 - 45:13)
will cut ties with anyone that does any (45:09 - 45:16)
sort of randomizers or emulation they do (45:13 - 45:19)
not want their games to be emuli uh (45:16 - 45:21)
emulated (45:19 - 45:22)
um (45:21 - 45:23)
and they don't want their games to be (45:22 - 45:25)
randomized and the only way to randomize (45:23 - 45:29)
the game is to modify the game software (45:25 - 45:33)
through an emulator (45:29 - 45:33)
so did you watch the video that's yes (45:34 - 45:40)
okay so it's it's like right it's the (45:37 - 45:42)
double misunderstanding because I do (45:40 - 45:44)
think number one that the initial (45:42 - 45:46)
response they got was a misunderstanding (45:44 - 45:48)
by whoever they spoke to that was (45:46 - 45:51)
linking like Nuzlocke and randomizer are (45:48 - 45:54)
always hand in hand right I think that's (45:51 - 45:56)
a misunderstanding but then they'd go on (45:54 - 45:57)
to say in the video (45:56 - 46:01)
we know creators that have been uh (45:57 - 46:04)
delisted or removed because they did (46:01 - 46:06)
nuzlocks which is their misunderstanding (46:04 - 46:10)
because they you know from what you said (46:06 - 46:13)
it's only people who use emulators and (46:10 - 46:16)
hacks and stuff like that (46:13 - 46:16)
so let's also talk about like I don't (46:17 - 46:22)
wanna (46:20 - 46:26)
I don't want to say corporations are (46:22 - 46:28)
correct in their thinking (46:26 - 46:31)
but Nintendo Minute isn't a content (46:28 - 46:33)
creator (46:31 - 46:36)
that exists outside of the company (46:33 - 46:40)
Nintendo Minute is an official Nintendo (46:36 - 46:44)
product would we all agree so yeah (46:40 - 46:49)
when they use a fan made anything it (46:44 - 46:54)
opens corporations to (46:49 - 46:57)
a lot of liability particularly with the (46:54 - 47:00)
name particularly with the rule set that (46:57 - 47:03)
they didn't create like there's a lot (47:00 - 47:06)
legally that a corporation the size of (47:03 - 47:09)
Nintendo needs to sort of consider and (47:06 - 47:13)
compensate for to be safe doing a fan (47:09 - 47:18)
made non-official thing and this is not (47:13 - 47:20)
worth it right like there's not a (47:18 - 47:21)
corporation that's like this could (47:20 - 47:24)
generate a few more views but we would (47:21 - 47:25)
be (47:24 - 47:28)
on the chain for x amount of money to (47:25 - 47:30)
pay the person that created this name (47:28 - 47:34)
and these rules it's not worth it (47:30 - 47:37)
so there's a lot of I'm sure there's a (47:34 - 47:38)
lot of mistranslation there there's a (47:37 - 47:41)
lot that they are saying yeah they got (47:38 - 47:43)
the smackdown for it because they're (47:41 - 47:46)
also not thinking along the lines of (47:43 - 47:47)
what a legal (47:46 - 47:51)
division in a corporation would be (47:47 - 47:54)
thinking about doing a fan made rule set (47:51 - 47:57)
on an official Channel (47:54 - 47:57)
there's also the there's (47:57 - 48:03)
the piggyback off Greg (48:01 - 48:05)
um (48:03 - 48:08)
if if Nintendo Minute does a Nuzlocke (48:05 - 48:10)
and they explain they say this is a (48:08 - 48:12)
Nuzlocke they're self-imposed rules (48:10 - 48:14)
that's what that's what it is right (48:12 - 48:16)
um (48:14 - 48:18)
and if you want to do this too here you (48:16 - 48:20)
go that still doesn't stop people from (48:18 - 48:23)
Googling Nuzlocke and then finding all (48:20 - 48:27)
of the randomizers of nuzlocke's or just (48:23 - 48:30)
some sort of modifications which then at (48:27 - 48:33)
that point they go well like Nintendo's (48:30 - 48:36)
Channel told me that this was okay (48:33 - 48:36)
um when like you're kind of going down (48:36 - 48:41)
this weird Rabbit Hole of like how did (48:39 - 48:43)
this start where did this come from how (48:41 - 48:44)
are these people doing these kind of (48:43 - 48:47)
nuzlocks uh it's a it's like it's (48:44 - 48:49)
definitely a gray area (48:47 - 48:52)
I also think like (48:49 - 48:52)
there there's this kind of there's this (48:53 - 48:57)
Acceptance in like the hardcore Pokemon (48:55 - 48:59)
community that like nuzlocke's are just (48:57 - 49:01)
a thing and I've done tons tons of (48:59 - 49:04)
nuzlocke's on my my twitch Channel and (49:01 - 49:06)
it is mind-blowing how many people just (49:04 - 49:08)
don't know what it is (49:06 - 49:11)
it is it is shocking how many times I (49:08 - 49:13)
have just done like a regular heart gold (49:11 - 49:15)
soul silver Nuzlocke or sword and shield (49:13 - 49:17)
Nuzlocke you know no I don't randomize I (49:15 - 49:19)
don't emulate nothing underneath that (49:17 - 49:21)
um and people come in like at least (49:19 - 49:24)
multiple times every single stream being (49:21 - 49:27)
like what's a Nuzlocke like how how are (49:24 - 49:28)
you doing how are you how are you (49:27 - 49:30)
capping your levels how are why why why (49:28 - 49:33)
what happens when your Pokemon dies and (49:30 - 49:34)
it's like oh you just release it like (49:33 - 49:36)
but do you have to (49:34 - 49:39)
no like no (49:36 - 49:41)
um (49:39 - 49:44)
so like yeah it doesn't doesn't surprise (49:41 - 49:45)
me that there was like a huge (49:44 - 49:48)
misunderstanding here (49:45 - 49:50)
or maybe they didn't explain it right to (49:48 - 49:51)
the Pokemon company or maybe the Pokemon (49:50 - 49:53)
company didn't hear it right or maybe (49:51 - 49:57)
they talked to a newer person or (49:53 - 49:59)
um the other thing I can say here (49:57 - 50:02)
is uh there are two content creators (49:59 - 50:05)
that I can think of that I've talked to (50:02 - 50:07)
that I've talked to or I've I've watched (50:05 - 50:10)
them do a video on uh one was shady (50:07 - 50:13)
penguin which is a pretty big content (50:10 - 50:16)
creator and (50:13 - 50:18)
um Nintendo wanted to work with him and (50:16 - 50:20)
I I'm saying this as as he made a (50:18 - 50:21)
YouTube video about this I don't know if (50:20 - 50:23)
that YouTube video is still up this was (50:21 - 50:25)
probably like four or five years ago (50:23 - 50:27)
this was before sword and shield (50:25 - 50:28)
um he made a YouTube video saying that (50:27 - 50:30)
Nintendo specifically wanted to work (50:28 - 50:32)
with him but they didn't want to work (50:30 - 50:35)
with him while he had randomized videos (50:32 - 50:38)
on his YouTube channel they were okay (50:35 - 50:42)
with his non-randomized nuzlocks but (50:38 - 50:44)
they wanted him to de-list his (50:42 - 50:47)
randomized nuzlocks in order to work (50:44 - 50:50)
with him going forward and he said no (50:47 - 50:52)
because that those videos were making (50:50 - 50:54)
him YouTube Revenue (50:52 - 50:57)
and so they never ended up working (50:54 - 50:59)
together (50:57 - 51:01)
the other person I've talked to (50:59 - 51:04)
literally the same story it was they (51:01 - 51:07)
were already working with Nintendo and (51:04 - 51:08)
then they decided to start doing (51:07 - 51:10)
randomized content on their YouTube (51:08 - 51:13)
channel Nintendo said no no no no (51:10 - 51:16)
you're encouraging emulation because (51:13 - 51:18)
that's the only way that's the only way (51:16 - 51:20)
you can randomize you need to emulate it (51:18 - 51:24)
and he they were like okay well I guess (51:20 - 51:25)
we're not working together anymore (51:24 - 51:27)
because these videos are bringing me (51:25 - 51:29)
money and that was the end of that (51:27 - 51:31)
partnership (51:29 - 51:33)
um and (51:31 - 51:36)
yeah I mean like the misunderstanding (51:33 - 51:39)
here sucks uh I mean like I said I (51:36 - 51:40)
personally talked to the Pokemon company (51:39 - 51:42)
Joe has talked to the Pokemon company (51:40 - 51:43)
what (51:42 - 51:46)
I I think people are misunderstanding (51:43 - 51:48)
kit and Krista's explanation here a (51:46 - 51:50)
little bit although (51:48 - 51:53)
like I I also don't know how old like (51:50 - 51:56)
how long ago was this I'm not sure (51:53 - 51:56)
um but yeah that's a (51:57 - 52:03)
that's a huge No-No by pretty much any (52:00 - 52:05)
company under the Nintendo umbrella is (52:03 - 52:09)
they do not want their stuff emulated in (52:05 - 52:12)
any way (52:09 - 52:12)
um (52:14 - 52:18)
so I I guess that's it I I don't know (52:15 - 52:20)
what more there is to talk about on that (52:18 - 52:21)
I'm sure people will forget about this (52:20 - 52:23)
in a day or two but like yeah that's (52:21 - 52:26)
that's pretty that's it (52:23 - 52:26)
um (52:27 - 52:29)
the (52:30 - 52:33)
the other thing I wanted to talk about (52:31 - 52:38)
is uh there was (52:33 - 52:41)
a situation of cheating at the Baltimore (52:38 - 52:44)
regionals (52:41 - 52:44)
yeah it's happening right now is that (52:44 - 52:51)
this is TCG this is TCG okay (52:47 - 52:54)
um it's really hard to explain this like (52:51 - 52:56)
cheating because it requires you it (52:54 - 52:58)
requires you to like understand the (52:56 - 53:02)
rules of the Pokemon TCG uh (52:58 - 53:03)
which (53:02 - 53:05)
you know if you've never played the TCG (53:03 - 53:10)
you you might not know what's happening (53:05 - 53:14)
so last night somebody uh (53:10 - 53:16)
in my twitch chat was like hey did you (53:14 - 53:18)
hear that somebody cheated at Baltimore (53:16 - 53:21)
regionals and I was like no do you have (53:18 - 53:22)
like a link because I know it was being (53:21 - 53:24)
live streamed and they're like they they (53:22 - 53:25)
so they gave me the link and they were (53:24 - 53:27)
like oh it's like two hours 35 minutes (53:25 - 53:28)
into the Stream (53:27 - 53:31)
and I was like okay cool well let's (53:28 - 53:33)
watch it and they they said like I don't (53:31 - 53:35)
really know how they cheated because I (53:33 - 53:38)
don't understand the TCG and I was like (53:35 - 53:40)
oh you know that's fair (53:38 - 53:40)
so I'm watching it so I watched I (53:41 - 53:46)
watched the clip and it it is to me it (53:44 - 53:48)
is very apparent that it's cheating it's (53:46 - 53:50)
so there there there's a thing in like (53:48 - 53:52)
any card game (53:50 - 53:54)
um will can attest this where you just (53:52 - 53:57)
you just make an honest mistake and (53:54 - 54:00)
sometimes the mistake is so game (53:57 - 54:02)
breaking that it's impossible to revert (54:00 - 54:05)
the game board back to the non (54:02 - 54:08)
modified State yeah I gotta had a buddy (54:05 - 54:10)
at the literally at the Vanguard World (54:08 - 54:13)
Championships who made a just simple (54:10 - 54:17)
very simple mistake and lost everything (54:13 - 54:19)
because his hand grabbed two cards (54:17 - 54:22)
rather than one yeah so like and and (54:19 - 54:25)
when when something like that happens (54:22 - 54:26)
it's uh (54:25 - 54:29)
it's left up to the judge to make the (54:26 - 54:31)
call I would say a lot of Judges make (54:29 - 54:33)
the wrong call uh but if the judge can't (54:31 - 54:35)
make a call there's a head judge uh who (54:33 - 54:38)
then ends up making the call so for (54:35 - 54:41)
example let's say you you have a a card (54:38 - 54:45)
that says draw seven cards uh that's a (54:41 - 54:47)
very common thing it'll say like discard (54:45 - 54:49)
your hand draw seven cards and when (54:47 - 54:51)
you're drawing cards if you accidentally (54:49 - 54:54)
draw an eighth card that would be (54:51 - 54:55)
considered (54:54 - 54:58)
um you know cheating not not intentional (54:55 - 55:02)
just an accident but you seeing an extra (54:58 - 55:04)
card like you like you drawing that (55:02 - 55:06)
eighth card and looking at it it's like (55:04 - 55:08)
oh and then putting that on the top of (55:06 - 55:11)
your deck like oh my bad you're you (55:08 - 55:13)
you're still getting too much (55:11 - 55:15)
information like knowing what your next (55:13 - 55:18)
card is is actually a pretty big deal so (55:15 - 55:21)
in that case I've made this mistake (55:18 - 55:23)
before like I've made a mistake where I (55:21 - 55:25)
was supposed to draw five cards my hand (55:23 - 55:27)
accident like the card stuck together I (55:25 - 55:29)
realized I had six cards in my hand (55:27 - 55:30)
um (55:29 - 55:31)
so a couple things can happen there (55:30 - 55:34)
either if your opponent (55:31 - 55:37)
was like oh it's not that big of a deal (55:34 - 55:41)
yes but like (55:37 - 55:45)
but in like a in a top 16 it is a big (55:41 - 55:47)
deal right like if if you're playing if (55:45 - 55:49)
you're playing with friends at home it's (55:47 - 55:51)
probably not a big deal if you know (55:49 - 55:53)
you're playing you know if you're at the (55:51 - 55:55)
losers bracket in in the in the (55:53 - 55:56)
tournament and like you're just playing (55:55 - 55:58)
for fun at that point yeah probably not (55:56 - 55:59)
a big deal (55:58 - 56:00)
um (55:59 - 56:03)
but uh so the judge can make a decision (56:00 - 56:06)
the judge can make a decision whether (56:03 - 56:08)
um they want you to shuffle your whole (56:06 - 56:11)
hand into your deck and redraw cards uh (56:08 - 56:13)
they can make a decision where your your (56:11 - 56:15)
opponent gets a prize card from that (56:13 - 56:18)
which is which is something I feel like (56:15 - 56:19)
you see more common where they're just (56:18 - 56:21)
like you made a mistake your opponent (56:19 - 56:22)
gets a free prize or gets two free (56:21 - 56:24)
prizes (56:22 - 56:28)
um uh or they can just say (56:24 - 56:31)
you lost we we cannot revert the game (56:28 - 56:32)
state (56:31 - 56:34)
you you lose this round it's best two (56:32 - 56:36)
out of three hope you win the next two (56:34 - 56:38)
rounds right (56:36 - 56:40)
I had a situation (56:38 - 56:42)
um sorry I I want to do a little setup (56:40 - 56:44)
before we get to the cheating part I had (56:42 - 56:46)
a situation where the last time I (56:44 - 56:48)
competed in the tournament I went to the (56:46 - 56:50)
Madison Regional Tournament I was (56:48 - 56:54)
playing golisopod Zoroark and I was (56:50 - 56:56)
purely playing for fun like I had no (56:54 - 56:57)
intention of winning this tournament (56:56 - 56:59)
right I was like I haven't played a (56:57 - 57:00)
tournament in several years (56:59 - 57:01)
um if people have been listening to the (57:00 - 57:03)
podcast for a long time they know that (57:01 - 57:05)
will and I played TCG competitively for (57:03 - 57:06)
several years we went to a lot of (57:05 - 57:08)
tournaments together (57:06 - 57:09)
um and a lot of tournaments every (57:08 - 57:11)
weekend but then I then I left during (57:09 - 57:14)
the X and Y era uh and then we'll (57:11 - 57:16)
continue to playing a little bit through (57:14 - 57:17)
that and then I came back for Sun and (57:16 - 57:18)
Moon and I was like you know what I just (57:17 - 57:20)
want to go to the tournament not because (57:18 - 57:22)
I I want to get back into it I just I (57:20 - 57:25)
really like this deck Madison is like 45 (57:22 - 57:28)
minutes away let me do this tournament (57:25 - 57:33)
and I was I was uh I was 2-1 before no (57:28 - 57:36)
sorry I was 2-0 before lunch (57:33 - 57:37)
um (57:36 - 57:39)
and maybe I was one one it doesn't (57:37 - 57:41)
matter anyways I went to lunch the (57:39 - 57:43)
here's the worst part about tournaments (57:41 - 57:46)
the worst part about tournaments is like (57:43 - 57:51)
if if you lose the match before lunch (57:46 - 57:55)
and you lose right away or you win right (57:51 - 57:58)
away you get a really long lunch (57:55 - 58:00)
because like a match is like 45 minutes (57:58 - 58:04)
and then plus three plus three turns and (58:00 - 58:06)
then lunch is like an hour (58:04 - 58:09)
and then the next match starts like one (58:06 - 58:12)
o'clock sharp if if uh lunch is at like (58:09 - 58:13)
noon (58:12 - 58:16)
the the worst feeling in the entire (58:13 - 58:19)
world in a tournament is not only going (58:16 - 58:23)
to 45 minutes in your match but then the (58:19 - 58:25)
plus three turns that you get which are (58:23 - 58:29)
untimed take forever and they eat into (58:25 - 58:31)
your lunch and the worst absolute (58:29 - 58:34)
feeling is having the world's longest (58:31 - 58:37)
match before lunch and then losing that (58:34 - 58:40)
match and then not only did you are you (58:37 - 58:42)
cutting into your lunch time but you (58:40 - 58:44)
lost (58:42 - 58:47)
it's at least if you like oh man I only (58:44 - 58:49)
have like 20 minutes of lunch left yeah (58:47 - 58:53)
but I won like that sucks but also feels (58:49 - 58:56)
great there's no recovery from like (58:53 - 58:58)
I have 20 minutes of lunch and I lost (58:56 - 59:03)
this what am I supposed to do anyways (58:58 - 59:03)
um (59:03 - 59:05)
I go to lunch and I come back (59:06 - 59:11)
and I'm walking back to the venue and (59:09 - 59:13)
I'm I'm like okay (59:11 - 59:16)
they they they're like you need to be in (59:13 - 59:19)
your seat at one o'clock the matches (59:16 - 59:21)
we're gonna start at one o'clock I'm (59:19 - 59:23)
walking to my I'm walking to the back to (59:21 - 59:25)
the venue it's like I'm looking at my (59:23 - 59:27)
watch it's like 12 58 I was like great (59:25 - 59:30)
cool uh I I get into the venue (59:27 - 59:33)
and I walk over to my table and I see (59:30 - 59:35)
there's already my opponent sitting down (59:33 - 59:38)
and there's a judge standing by my seat (59:35 - 59:40)
and I sit down (59:38 - 59:44)
and it is exactly 12 o'clock it turns 12 (59:40 - 59:47)
o'clock as I'm walking I sit down before (59:44 - 59:49)
1201. (59:47 - 59:52)
and the judge was like (59:49 - 59:54)
uh we're giving you a penalty because (59:52 - 59:56)
you're not here on time (59:54 - 60:00)
and I was like I'm here it's 12 o'clock (59:56 - 60:02)
and they were like well we wanted (60:00 - 60:05)
everyone sitting down before 12 o'clock (60:02 - 60:07)
and your opponent called the job your (60:05 - 60:08)
opponent called me over because you (60:07 - 60:11)
weren't here before 12. and I said okay (60:08 - 60:14)
well I'm here now and they were like (60:11 - 60:15)
well because you weren't here before (60:14 - 60:17)
because you weren't sitting down before (60:15 - 60:20)
12 o'clock we're giving you a penalty (60:17 - 60:23)
and your penalty is you're not allowed (60:20 - 60:26)
to lose this match you need to win both (60:23 - 60:27)
games (60:26 - 60:30)
that was my penalty (60:27 - 60:33)
that was what the judge decided so they (60:30 - 60:36)
gave you one loss basically you're (60:33 - 60:38)
basically yes because I was not in my (60:36 - 60:42)
seat before 12 I was in my seat at 12. (60:38 - 60:46)
and that it it's it's literally because (60:42 - 60:49)
my opponent called a Judge early because (60:46 - 60:51)
they were fishing (60:49 - 60:54)
for any sort of like (60:51 - 60:56)
penalty right oh that's Oh you mean it (60:54 - 60:59)
was a Pokemon player yeah yeah (60:56 - 61:02)
right because like other people were (60:59 - 61:04)
sitting down before like after me but (61:02 - 61:05)
there were no judges standing and (61:04 - 61:07)
waiting like my my opponent had to call (61:05 - 61:11)
the judge over and I mean as far as my (61:07 - 61:14)
experience it's traditionally like a (61:11 - 61:16)
five or ten minute rule if you're not (61:14 - 61:18)
there within five minutes after the (61:16 - 61:21)
match starting then you get a loss not (61:18 - 61:23)
you have to be seated before the match (61:21 - 61:26)
actually starts (61:23 - 61:27)
um (61:26 - 61:28)
I end up winning both of those games (61:27 - 61:31)
because I I I I had the type advantage (61:28 - 61:33)
in that match but it was it was still a (61:31 - 61:36)
very frustrating experience anyways uh (61:33 - 61:40)
no way I'm gonna say this right now (61:36 - 61:43)
there is no way had that judge done that (61:40 - 61:46)
to me that a I would be allowed back at (61:43 - 61:48)
that event and (61:46 - 61:50)
T (61:48 - 61:54)
that that judge would ever want to judge (61:50 - 61:56)
anything again in their life (61:54 - 61:59)
they would not they would not have (61:56 - 62:00)
enjoyed (61:59 - 62:02)
anything that happened after that (62:00 - 62:05)
conversation and probably would have (62:02 - 62:07)
needed to go to therapy yeah that that's (62:05 - 62:09)
like I have so many complaints about (62:07 - 62:12)
competitive Pokemon but it's like on one (62:09 - 62:14)
hand there are like competitive Pokemon (62:12 - 62:19)
players who will look for any way to (62:14 - 62:20)
disrupt their opponent and I'm not (62:19 - 62:22)
talking about through actually playing (62:20 - 62:24)
the game just like two like they flick (62:22 - 62:26)
their cards they just are like generally (62:24 - 62:29)
an annoying person to get under your (62:26 - 62:31)
skin but on the other side of that there (62:29 - 62:34)
are people who are Pokemon judges who (62:31 - 62:35)
have passed the judge exam and (62:34 - 62:37)
everything like that where that is the (62:35 - 62:38)
only source of power they have in their (62:37 - 62:41)
life and they are going to exercise it (62:38 - 62:43)
to the fullest at every opportunity that (62:41 - 62:44)
they have (62:43 - 62:47)
there are a lot of judges too so there's (62:44 - 62:48)
the opposite of that where there are (62:47 - 62:50)
Judges that are like Power Trip judges (62:48 - 62:52)
but there are Judges that are literally (62:50 - 62:54)
scared of everything and they will let (62:52 - 62:56)
players bully them around yeah because (62:54 - 62:59)
they they would rather side with the (62:56 - 63:02)
aggressive player than to side with the (62:59 - 63:03)
passive like I don't want to say (63:02 - 63:05)
anything player (63:03 - 63:07)
um hey this is why you cannot be passive (63:05 - 63:10)
with these people this is why (63:07 - 63:14)
people at work fear me and rightly so (63:10 - 63:17)
so anyways uh (63:14 - 63:20)
the frustrating thing here is nothing (63:17 - 63:21)
has been done for the cheating at (63:20 - 63:24)
Baltimore regionals as of this recording (63:21 - 63:27)
ah there was a judge so so the reason (63:24 - 63:29)
that I was able to see this cheating and (63:27 - 63:30)
other people saw this cheating was (63:29 - 63:33)
because it was being recorded on stream (63:30 - 63:36)
now I I will never sit on the show and I (63:33 - 63:39)
will never encourage anyone to cheat (63:36 - 63:43)
ever don't do it it's it's unfair it's (63:39 - 63:45)
dumb or I don't know if if you can't (63:43 - 63:46)
play (63:45 - 63:49)
a competitive game without cheating I'm (63:46 - 63:50)
not even sure why you're attending these (63:49 - 63:54)
events but with that being said (63:50 - 63:57)
if you're going to cheat (63:54 - 63:58)
maybe don't cheat when you're being (63:57 - 64:00)
broadcasted to thousands of people on (63:58 - 64:01)
Twitch and YouTube (64:00 - 64:05)
there there is no secret when you're (64:01 - 64:09)
being recorded it is like when you are (64:05 - 64:11)
on stage and you are being broadcasted (64:09 - 64:14)
to Twitch they tell you and even if like (64:11 - 64:17)
you weren't listening there are cameras (64:14 - 64:21)
all around you it is you are at a (64:17 - 64:24)
special table so I don't know if you're (64:21 - 64:25)
maybe like (64:24 - 64:30)
going to cheat don't number one but also (64:25 - 64:33)
maybe don't do it when your entire game (64:30 - 64:36)
is being recorded and watched at the (64:33 - 64:37)
same time (64:36 - 64:39)
that's my advice (64:37 - 64:43)
anyways this game is is game three there (64:39 - 64:45)
was one win on both sides (64:43 - 64:49)
the player who I have deemed cheating (64:45 - 64:52)
per my understanding of the rules (64:49 - 64:56)
uh was top 16 at Worlds in London (64:52 - 64:59)
they're a very well-known player and the (64:56 - 65:00)
play (64:59 - 65:04)
so so they they draw a card that card is (65:00 - 65:08)
an energy they use greninja's ability to (65:04 - 65:10)
discard the energy from their hand to (65:08 - 65:13)
then draw two cards (65:10 - 65:15)
uh (65:13 - 65:18)
they then (65:15 - 65:21)
use an incense which is an item in (65:18 - 65:23)
Pokemon go that came from the Pokemon go (65:21 - 65:27)
uh TCG set they use the incense to then (65:23 - 65:30)
search out a drizzle in their deck (65:27 - 65:32)
which is legal that's what that card (65:30 - 65:35)
does they evolve a Sobel to the drizzle (65:32 - 65:39)
so without shuffling (65:35 - 65:41)
when when you evolve (65:39 - 65:44)
Sable into drizzle you can then go back (65:41 - 65:46)
into your deck and search for a (65:44 - 65:49)
supporter card so they don't Shuffle Now (65:46 - 65:51)
normally when you search in your deck (65:49 - 65:53)
for a card you have to shuffle and then (65:51 - 65:55)
your opponent cuts it but because the (65:53 - 65:58)
incense gave them access to their deck (65:55 - 66:00)
and they grab drizzle and drizzle gives (65:58 - 66:02)
them access to the deck it's a usually a (66:00 - 66:04)
mutual agreement between both players (66:02 - 66:05)
that like you don't need to shuffle (66:04 - 66:08)
you're going to go right back in I mean (66:05 - 66:10)
you you say to your opponent I'm going (66:08 - 66:12)
back in is it okay if I don't Shuffle (66:10 - 66:16)
yeah yes and and and this is this is (66:12 - 66:18)
wildly accepted by all players because (66:16 - 66:20)
one no one wants to shuffle their deck (66:18 - 66:23)
to then go back in to look for a card (66:20 - 66:25)
and two it just saves time you only have (66:23 - 66:27)
45 minutes I don't want to watch my (66:25 - 66:29)
opponent shuffle for 20 of those 45 (66:27 - 66:31)
minutes I know what they're doing I (66:29 - 66:33)
understand it they know what I'm doing (66:31 - 66:36)
it's it's very it's like it's totally (66:33 - 66:38)
fair and and right but if you go to the (66:36 - 66:39)
game rules you're supposed to shuffle (66:38 - 66:41)
anytime in between (66:39 - 66:44)
um so they they go back into their deck (66:41 - 66:46)
because when you evolve drizzle you're (66:44 - 66:49)
allowed to grab a trainer card from your (66:46 - 66:51)
deck so they go back into their deck and (66:49 - 66:54)
they grab irada irada from Pokemon (66:51 - 66:56)
Legends Arceus (66:54 - 66:58)
and this is where they cheat (66:56 - 67:00)
so irada (66:58 - 67:03)
is a supporter card you're allowed to (67:00 - 67:05)
play one supporter card per turn I said (67:03 - 67:07)
they played an incense incense is a (67:05 - 67:08)
trainer card you can play as many (67:07 - 67:10)
trainers sorry item card you can play as (67:08 - 67:12)
many item cards as you want (67:10 - 67:13)
um (67:12 - 67:15)
so they take erida out of their deck and (67:13 - 67:17)
they put it in the active play area that (67:15 - 67:20)
is the area above your bench in between (67:17 - 67:21)
both players (67:20 - 67:23)
and then they say I'm going to go back (67:21 - 67:24)
in (67:23 - 67:27)
which is again totally appropriate (67:24 - 67:31)
so Ira does card specifically States you (67:27 - 67:32)
need to go into your deck search your (67:31 - 67:36)
deck for one water type Pokemon and one (67:32 - 67:38)
item card show them to your opponent put (67:36 - 67:40)
them in your hands (67:38 - 67:42)
that that your era does very clear on (67:40 - 67:44)
what what it's doing (67:42 - 67:46)
I've never played irada irada did not (67:44 - 67:49)
exist when I played the TCG uh it's very (67:46 - 67:50)
easy to understand (67:49 - 67:53)
search in your deck for a water type (67:50 - 67:56)
Pokemon search in your deck for a item (67:53 - 67:57)
card (67:56 - 68:00)
uh that player then proceeds to grab a (67:57 - 68:03)
uh switch it's a certain kind of switch (68:00 - 68:04)
it's one of the newer switches I can't (68:03 - 68:06)
remember it's like electric switch or (68:04 - 68:07)
something (68:06 - 68:10)
um and then they grab a quick ball (68:07 - 68:13)
now you don't need to understand the TCG (68:10 - 68:15)
to know neither of those things they (68:13 - 68:19)
grabbed is a water Pokemon (68:15 - 68:21)
I don't think anyone needs like I think (68:19 - 68:24)
if you saw if you if you've seen a (68:21 - 68:25)
single Pokemon card in your life you (68:24 - 68:27)
know what a water Pokemon is it's very (68:25 - 68:30)
obvious (68:27 - 68:30)
um (68:30 - 68:34)
they then (68:31 - 68:37)
discard the quick ball and uh a battle (68:34 - 68:40)
VIP pass from there they then take those (68:37 - 68:42)
two cards put them in their hand discard (68:40 - 68:44)
the quick ball they just drew discarded (68:42 - 68:46)
another card from their hand battle VIP (68:44 - 68:49)
and they went go back into their deck to (68:46 - 68:51)
grab a crow bat (68:49 - 68:54)
now now (68:51 - 68:57)
the commentators literally say if you're (68:54 - 69:00)
watching this clip back (68:57 - 69:02)
he needs to grab a water Pokemon he (69:00 - 69:05)
hasn't he cannot grab two item cards (69:02 - 69:08)
and then before he right when he (69:05 - 69:10)
discards the quick ball and the other (69:08 - 69:12)
item card (69:10 - 69:15)
his opponent asks what's happening and (69:12 - 69:18)
he shows the switch that he he then (69:15 - 69:20)
because he when he grabs these cards he (69:18 - 69:24)
shuffles his hand he then shows the the (69:20 - 69:26)
switch that he initially grabbed off (69:24 - 69:29)
irida and then he shows Palkia that has (69:26 - 69:32)
been in his hand the entire time and he (69:29 - 69:33)
shows that these are the two cards I (69:32 - 69:36)
drew (69:33 - 69:36)
and then the commentators were like oh I (69:36 - 69:40)
think he's just doing things out of (69:39 - 69:43)
order it seems fine by the judges (69:40 - 69:45)
but when you continue watching (69:43 - 69:47)
afterwards (69:45 - 69:51)
there and if you watch before (69:47 - 69:54)
there was never a water type Pokemon (69:51 - 69:57)
ever drawn off erida the quick ball went (69:54 - 69:59)
to get a crowbat (69:57 - 70:02)
the Palkia was always in his hand (69:59 - 70:05)
when his turn was over there was never a (70:02 - 70:07)
water type Pokemon shown he got a water (70:05 - 70:10)
type Pokemon off the incense (70:07 - 70:14)
which was drizzle and drizzle got the (70:10 - 70:17)
irida (70:14 - 70:20)
but the intentionally flashing the the (70:17 - 70:23)
Palkia and the switch when asked what he (70:20 - 70:24)
got (70:23 - 70:26)
like he knew what he was doing there was (70:24 - 70:28)
no accident here there was no I (70:26 - 70:31)
accidentally played (70:28 - 70:35)
uh drizzle on a sable when Saba was was (70:31 - 70:36)
played this turn there was no I (70:35 - 70:38)
accidentally Drew six cards instead of (70:36 - 70:40)
five cards (70:38 - 70:43)
like this is a top 16 player (70:40 - 70:46)
at the World Championships I believe (70:43 - 70:48)
they have won regionals before (70:46 - 70:51)
but like era does does not do that (70:48 - 70:54)
and that game ended in a draw (70:51 - 70:56)
which (70:54 - 70:58)
isn't the point (70:56 - 71:01)
whether or not you win or you you could (70:58 - 71:04)
be like well he cheated but lost (71:01 - 71:06)
yeah he's still cheated (71:04 - 71:08)
I mean he's going to be competing in (71:06 - 71:11)
future tournaments now and he's like (71:08 - 71:12)
well I can get away with cheating so (71:11 - 71:14)
that's cool (71:12 - 71:16)
what's even funnier is uh a couple (71:14 - 71:20)
months ago he tweeted that era duck he (71:16 - 71:22)
he like deleted the copy on irida and (71:20 - 71:24)
instead of saying draw one water type (71:22 - 71:27)
Pokemon and draw one item card he just (71:24 - 71:29)
erased it and he said do anything you (71:27 - 71:30)
want (71:29 - 71:33)
which is actually kind of ironic (71:30 - 71:36)
I'm heated about this I'm like I'm (71:33 - 71:38)
heated that like the commentary mentions (71:36 - 71:41)
that like you can't do that and then (71:38 - 71:42)
they're like I'm not sure what's (71:41 - 71:43)
happening and then the turn was over and (71:42 - 71:44)
then they didn't bring it up which you (71:43 - 71:46)
know to be fair there has to be some (71:44 - 71:48)
professionalism in commentary right like (71:46 - 71:50)
you can't like you kind of have to be (71:48 - 71:51)
like ah the judges will figure out (71:50 - 71:53)
because you're not a judge right you're (71:51 - 71:55)
just commentating but there is a judge (71:53 - 71:56)
sitting right there what is the judge (71:55 - 71:58)
doing like what like how do you get to (71:56 - 72:01)
the end of that turn and go like your (71:58 - 72:03)
supporter did not ever draw a water type (72:01 - 72:06)
Pokemon you drew two items off of that (72:03 - 72:08)
play (72:06 - 72:08)
like how how is this player playing in (72:08 - 72:13)
day two which is this morning like it is (72:11 - 72:16)
infuriating that like nothing is being (72:13 - 72:17)
done and I know that there's always (72:16 - 72:22)
talks about like well uh X player in (72:17 - 72:24)
sword and shield they use this program (72:22 - 72:29)
to like hack in these Pokemon or whatnot (72:24 - 72:31)
um they're they're they're I'm not going (72:29 - 72:33)
to go down a conversation of legit (72:31 - 72:35)
versus legal (72:33 - 72:36)
right (72:35 - 72:38)
that is its own conversation but the (72:36 - 72:40)
nice thing about sword and shield (72:38 - 72:43)
or any of or Pokemon unite or pokken (72:40 - 72:46)
tournament is you (72:43 - 72:49)
you are still restricted to the rules of (72:46 - 72:50)
that video game (72:49 - 72:53)
even if you were playing the TCG online (72:50 - 72:55)
or TCG live (72:53 - 72:57)
when you play one of these cards you are (72:55 - 72:59)
restricted to what that card is telling (72:57 - 73:00)
you to do (72:59 - 73:03)
in actual card games Magic the Gathering (73:00 - 73:06)
Yu-Gi-Oh Vanguard Pokemon (73:03 - 73:09)
so much of the cheating happens because (73:06 - 73:12)
of misunderstanding the rules or plays (73:09 - 73:15)
happening so fast (73:12 - 73:19)
that like they get away with it and in (73:15 - 73:21)
this situation it is it is it you can (73:19 - 73:23)
rewind it and re-watch it over and over (73:21 - 73:25)
again that this is clear and blatant (73:23 - 73:26)
cheating (73:25 - 73:28)
and like (73:26 - 73:32)
like as somebody who left the trading (73:28 - 73:34)
card game I left the trading card game (73:32 - 73:37)
because of cheating because of the not (73:34 - 73:41)
not people drawing too many cards or (73:37 - 73:42)
people (73:41 - 73:45)
um like stacking their deck a certain (73:42 - 73:46)
way so they can draw the cards they want (73:45 - 73:51)
I left Pokemon TCG because people would (73:46 - 73:54)
bully you and Gaslight you in order to (73:51 - 73:59)
win a match 100 for Pokemon Pokemon TCG (73:54 - 74:02)
and people would just be wild about it (73:59 - 74:03)
absolutely (74:02 - 74:06)
I've seen 12 year old kids (74:03 - 74:08)
draw not from the top of the deck (74:06 - 74:10)
like they they know where the card they (74:08 - 74:12)
want is and they draw that in a way that (74:10 - 74:14)
looks like they drew it off the top of (74:12 - 74:17)
the deck but they didn't (74:14 - 74:17)
um and if the Pokemon company is not (74:17 - 74:21)
going to like reevaluate or look at this (74:19 - 74:25)
and do the problem like well then what (74:21 - 74:28)
like what's the point then (74:25 - 74:30)
like you have integrity in your game I (74:28 - 74:32)
do not care if this is a top player they (74:30 - 74:34)
blatantly cheated (74:32 - 74:37)
like it was not an accident sheet it was (74:34 - 74:40)
not like oh my bad accidentally I forgot (74:37 - 74:43)
I played a supporter (74:40 - 74:43)
and again it doesn't matter if that game (74:44 - 74:48)
ended in a draw it doesn't matter at all (74:45 - 74:50)
there was still intention of like well (74:48 - 74:53)
and the question is is (74:50 - 74:56)
okay it ended in a draw would it have (74:53 - 74:59)
ended in a draw if the game was played (74:56 - 75:00)
correctly (74:59 - 75:02)
we don't know now (75:00 - 75:05)
we don't know if that person would have (75:02 - 75:08)
actually lost and their actions while (75:05 - 75:11)
didn't secure them a win secured them a (75:08 - 75:12)
draw (75:11 - 75:15)
like we don't we don't know the actual (75:12 - 75:20)
outcome of a fairly played game (75:15 - 75:22)
so saying that oh it ended in a draw so (75:20 - 75:24)
it doesn't matter (75:22 - 75:26)
it still matters because we don't know (75:24 - 75:28)
what the reality was in that situation (75:26 - 75:33)
because the game was compromised (75:28 - 75:33)
um yeah so I I reached out to one person (75:36 - 75:43)
at the Pokemon company and I was like (75:40 - 75:44)
we doing something about like what what (75:43 - 75:47)
are you guys doing (75:44 - 75:47)
uh (75:48 - 75:50)
yeah I mean like (75:52 - 75:56)
this is not the first time that somebody (75:54 - 75:58)
has cheated on an official Pokemon (75:56 - 76:01)
stream I believe uh there was a (75:58 - 76:03)
situation where somebody has been a (76:01 - 76:06)
known cheater and they they then cheated (76:03 - 76:08)
that's the thing too is like known (76:06 - 76:10)
cheaters (76:08 - 76:12)
continue to cheat (76:10 - 76:16)
it's usually not a one-off situation (76:12 - 76:16)
um (76:16 - 76:20)
and there was a there was a situation uh (76:16 - 76:22)
uh a couple years ago where a known (76:20 - 76:23)
cheater (76:22 - 76:25)
who has been caught cheating before and (76:23 - 76:27)
was like you know hey we'll give you one (76:25 - 76:29)
more chance they cheated again on a (76:27 - 76:31)
Pokemon broadcast (76:29 - 76:33)
and they were permanently banned from (76:31 - 76:35)
future events (76:33 - 76:37)
but also like they were they were given (76:35 - 76:39)
one more chance multiple times (76:37 - 76:41)
and (76:39 - 76:44)
who knows how many times they cheated (76:41 - 76:47)
off of camera (76:44 - 76:47)
uh (76:47 - 76:51)
because you can only really like replay (76:48 - 76:53)
and get the things on camera anyways (76:51 - 76:56)
that's incredibly frustrating to me uh (76:53 - 76:57)
it's funny that this episode we talked (76:56 - 77:00)
about like emulation and ROM hacks and (76:57 - 77:02)
cheating and misinformation oh this is (77:00 - 77:05)
the cheaters episode uh didn't realize (77:02 - 77:09)
for that to happen uh but (77:05 - 77:11)
I think it's time for uh question of the (77:09 - 77:12)
week (77:11 - 77:14)
question over the week (77:12 - 77:17)
question of the week (77:14 - 77:20)
I am very excited for this program (77:17 - 77:22)
one of my favorite properties in the (77:20 - 77:24)
world absolutely (77:22 - 77:26)
and I'm glad that they finally got Gomez (77:24 - 77:30)
right yeah seriously (77:26 - 77:30)
uh this is from sleeve off our YouTube (77:35 - 77:40)
channel if you want (77:38 - 77:43)
to leave a YouTube comment now this is (77:40 - 77:44)
where this were the part of the video (77:43 - 77:47)
where you like comment subscribe uh (77:44 - 77:51)
uh sleeve says recently wizards of coats (77:47 - 77:53)
Coast Wizards of the Coast announced (77:51 - 77:55)
they would be rolling out a new and (77:53 - 77:57)
modified rule set for d d and using (77:55 - 77:58)
Community play testing and feedback to (77:57 - 78:00)
adapt these projects what if any impact (77:58 - 78:02)
do you think the Pokemon Community would (78:00 - 78:04)
have on the development and future (78:02 - 78:08)
products for tpci (78:04 - 78:08)
oh yeah so so the Wizards of the Coast (78:16 - 78:22)
saying they're like used in community to (78:19 - 78:23)
play tests and they're looking for (78:22 - 78:25)
feedback so they're saying like has that (78:23 - 78:28)
happened in the Pokemon Community for (78:25 - 78:32)
I'm just trying to think of (78:28 - 78:32)
a play test situation of a new of a new (78:33 - 78:41)
thing right like (78:38 - 78:44)
for wizards they had played tested the (78:41 - 78:47)
fifth edition of d d before they made (78:44 - 78:49)
this rule set and now they're in play (78:47 - 78:52)
pit test to get feedback because it's a (78:49 - 78:55)
rule set that's not established and I (78:52 - 78:57)
I'm thinking like it would be really (78:55 - 79:01)
difficult to roll out test cards and be (78:57 - 79:03)
like hey (79:01 - 79:05)
play with these cards and see if your (79:03 - 79:07)
game breaks well no I think it's not (79:05 - 79:11)
cards I it's everything right I think (79:07 - 79:12)
they're thinking like video game too and (79:11 - 79:13)
I'm like (79:12 - 79:16)
there is a play test server for unite (79:13 - 79:18)
there is a play test server for unite so (79:16 - 79:20)
they do do it a little bit for you for (79:18 - 79:22)
unite to get feedback (79:20 - 79:24)
so I know other card games that have (79:22 - 79:26)
play testers but nobody ever wants to be (79:24 - 79:28)
a play tester because then you can't (79:26 - 79:31)
play in the competitive you're literally (79:28 - 79:32)
banned from playing competitive if (79:31 - 79:34)
you're a play tester (79:32 - 79:36)
but also like (79:34 - 79:38)
for the video game (79:36 - 79:41)
I think it's to apple style right if (79:38 - 79:43)
they have people play testing different (79:41 - 79:45)
aspects of the video game those people (79:43 - 79:46)
are going to talk (79:45 - 79:49)
and give away all the secrets and (79:46 - 79:51)
everything and it's just like (79:49 - 79:54)
there will be no surprises where D D is (79:51 - 79:56)
such a different project product because (79:54 - 79:58)
right yeah DND is (79:56 - 80:00)
we're going to give you like the (79:58 - 80:02)
structure of the universe and you tell (80:00 - 80:04)
your own story right where Pokemon is (80:02 - 80:05)
like (80:04 - 80:08)
we we have full control I mean of (80:05 - 80:10)
everything (80:08 - 80:14)
what I mean to be (80:10 - 80:14)
slightly uh (80:14 - 80:21)
uh cranky about free play test is (80:17 - 80:23)
for video games they have a quality (80:21 - 80:27)
assurance group that has to do QA for (80:23 - 80:28)
their video games to make sure that it (80:27 - 80:31)
runs right and wizards and other places (80:28 - 80:34)
and I do it too for my own products (80:31 - 80:36)
because I don't have a huge budget for (80:34 - 80:38)
actually paid quality assurance people (80:36 - 80:41)
you lean on people to say hey can you (80:38 - 80:43)
play with this a bunch and check its (80:41 - 80:45)
quality and give me feedback I mean I (80:43 - 80:48)
would argue that Wizards does not need (80:45 - 80:53)
to do this for D and D but does it as (80:48 - 80:55)
like a way to get free quality assurance (80:53 - 81:00)
and build uh good honestly they could (80:55 - 81:01)
just hire (81:00 - 81:05)
established and well-known game Masters (81:01 - 81:09)
yeah the entire cast of VRE podcast for (81:05 - 81:14)
example could just be on the the payroll (81:09 - 81:16)
and they'd get great feedback (81:14 - 81:18)
um (81:16 - 81:22)
it's hard to say in things like (81:18 - 81:22)
writing is easy to edit I don't think (81:27 - 81:33)
code is as easy to edit (81:30 - 81:35)
right like if everybody's like these 17 (81:33 - 81:38)
moods are bad that you can just rewrite (81:35 - 81:40)
easily to paragraph and be like how does (81:38 - 81:41)
this work (81:40 - 81:43)
but I don't know if it's easy to be like (81:41 - 81:47)
okay we'll change these 17 moves in code (81:43 - 81:49)
uh I think there is some Community (81:47 - 81:52)
influence on Pokemon games uh like (81:49 - 81:54)
competitive has gotten easier over the (81:52 - 81:57)
years uh and you know like the ability (81:54 - 82:01)
capsules the uh mints (81:57 - 82:04)
um the bottle caps like I've I felt like (82:01 - 82:05)
a lot of those came from Community (82:04 - 82:08)
Voices being like I want this to be (82:05 - 82:09)
easier (82:08 - 82:11)
um if that scarlet and violet has like a (82:09 - 82:14)
zero IV bottle cap I feel like that is (82:11 - 82:16)
truly game freak or the Pokemon company (82:14 - 82:19)
like listening uh because that's like (82:16 - 82:21)
one of the few things that competitive (82:19 - 82:24)
is missing is is like yeah perfect IVs (82:21 - 82:26)
are great but also zero IVs are great in (82:24 - 82:29)
very specific cases and it's impossible (82:26 - 82:32)
for that to happen right now (82:29 - 82:35)
um they're (82:32 - 82:38)
I feel like the biggest (82:35 - 82:40)
community (82:38 - 82:44)
impact that had actual influence on the (82:40 - 82:47)
future products was black and white (82:44 - 82:52)
I felt like they did so many things that (82:47 - 82:54)
people wanted (82:52 - 82:56)
because of black and white or at least (82:54 - 82:59)
the vocal might the vocal minority (82:56 - 83:02)
majority uh wanted and then black yeah (82:59 - 83:04)
like when they banned the Genies from (83:02 - 83:07)
competitive yeah no I meant like black (83:04 - 83:08)
and white as a whole (83:07 - 83:10)
but black and white then went on to sell (83:08 - 83:13)
not as well as other Pokemon games and (83:10 - 83:16)
then it was almost like games after that (83:13 - 83:19)
became more conservative (83:16 - 83:21)
and then people were like I wish they (83:19 - 83:23)
would take these big risks they did it (83:21 - 83:25)
was black and white and that game didn't (83:23 - 83:26)
sell well (83:25 - 83:28)
even though it's like the best story and (83:26 - 83:32)
everything and all the Pokemon history (83:28 - 83:32)
yeah I don't know there's like a certain (83:33 - 83:36)
point where like (83:34 - 83:38)
maybe don't listen to your community as (83:36 - 83:40)
much because at least you know through (83:38 - 83:42)
recording this podcast for almost 12 (83:40 - 83:45)
years 12 years like I felt like the (83:42 - 83:47)
thing I always saw is like I wish the (83:45 - 83:49)
story would be better I wish they would (83:47 - 83:51)
do more story I and then like you know (83:49 - 83:53)
seeing games like sun and moon and sword (83:51 - 83:54)
and shield where they do try to focus on (83:53 - 83:56)
the story and then you see that you see (83:54 - 83:57)
the (83:56 - 83:59)
um man the story is really getting in (83:57 - 84:01)
the way like why are there so many cut (83:59 - 84:02)
scenes like why is there so much (84:01 - 84:04)
dialogue and it's like (84:02 - 84:07)
am I the only one like am I living in a (84:04 - 84:10)
different reality like I swear that like (84:07 - 84:12)
this is what I just heard for years and (84:10 - 84:14)
years like you want this story and then (84:12 - 84:15)
now the story is here people are like (84:14 - 84:19)
the issue that people fall into is you (84:15 - 84:21)
hear the people who want story they get (84:19 - 84:22)
it (84:21 - 84:25)
and they shut up (84:22 - 84:29)
because people don't tend to tweet I (84:25 - 84:31)
really love all the changes that made to (84:29 - 84:33)
the story and go on and go on and the (84:31 - 84:35)
few that do don't get powered by the (84:33 - 84:38)
algorithm so when the vacuum of voices (84:35 - 84:40)
who are calling for a better story (84:38 - 84:42)
disappear (84:40 - 84:44)
there creates a vacuum for people who (84:42 - 84:46)
are complaining there's too much story (84:44 - 84:48)
and then you see that happen it's like (84:46 - 84:50)
you used to ask what what happened to (84:48 - 84:52)
all the people who wanted gen 3 remakes (84:50 - 84:55)
we got it and we shut up (84:52 - 84:58)
and so the people now who wanted Gen 4 (84:55 - 85:00)
remakes could get very loud and filled (84:58 - 85:04)
the space it's really hard to say like (85:00 - 85:06)
it's the exact same person who wanted (85:04 - 85:09)
story who got it and then said well I (85:06 - 85:11)
don't want story now now they just got (85:09 - 85:13)
quiet (85:11 - 85:15)
because they got what they wanted and (85:13 - 85:17)
they're happy in the corner with their (85:15 - 85:19)
story (85:17 - 85:23)
I'm ready for those you know for remakes (85:19 - 85:25)
I'm sure Pokemon sleep will come right (85:23 - 85:27)
alongside it Pokemon sleep will be the (85:25 - 85:29)
new dream world (85:27 - 85:29)
I just want them to release Pokemon (85:30 - 85:33)
sleep so I don't have to hear about it (85:31 - 85:34)
anymore (85:33 - 85:36)
I don't actually care if it's good or (85:34 - 85:39)
not a year from now Pokemon sleep is a (85:36 - 85:41)
weekly segment on this program yeah it's (85:39 - 85:44)
just an amazing product I'm very excited (85:41 - 85:46)
for that future very excited for that (85:44 - 85:48)
future uh (85:46 - 85:51)
question of the or Pokemon of the week (85:48 - 85:55)
last week's Pokemon let's cue this up uh (85:51 - 85:56)
that's one I thought I had done before (85:55 - 85:59)
possibly I did talked about building my (85:56 - 86:03)
shiny bug team uh and having to (85:59 - 86:06)
faint a heck ton of them to get improved (86:03 - 86:09)
shiny odds uh and then I complained that (86:06 - 86:10)
they're just handing them out left and (86:09 - 86:14)
right for anybody to have nowadays (86:10 - 86:14)
hits core fish (86:16 - 86:20)
it's numb how is corfish a bug he's like (86:21 - 86:28)

what Gen 2 Pokemon do we oh we did (86:45 - 86:50)
Totodile total literally had no trivia (86:48 - 86:53)
and snob has like eight pages of trivia (86:50 - 86:55)
yeah I guess Nam is amazing (86:53 - 86:59)
thought I was like 22 years old (86:55 - 86:59)
snob shares its category with Caterpie (86:59 - 87:02)
and wormple they're known as the worm (87:01 - 87:06)

who was left out if you think there are (88:45 - 88:52)
two possible answers you are incorrect (88:48 - 88:52)
all right uh I guess will is in charge (88:54 - 88:58)
of the podcast next week (88:56 - 89:01)
well it will be entirely in Korean (88:58 - 89:06)
oh heck yeah I will I will be in Korea (89:01 - 89:08)
um (89:06 - 89:10)
yeah so I I will be in South Korea there (89:08 - 89:12)
is a safari zone happening this upcoming (89:10 - 89:14)
weekend uh again I don't know if I'm (89:12 - 89:16)
playing all three days or if I'm playing (89:14 - 89:20)
one day uh well what whatever Niantic (89:16 - 89:21)
wants I don't know (89:20 - 89:23)
if they don't even give if they don't (89:21 - 89:24)
give me the free ticket I'll just buy my (89:23 - 89:26)
own ticket at this point uh but that (89:24 - 89:28)
will be I will be in Korea Friday (89:26 - 89:31)
Saturday Sunday Monday uh and I'll be (89:28 - 89:32)
streaming that experience on Twitch (89:31 - 89:35)
assuming everything works (89:32 - 89:37)
so we'll be playing Pokemon go (89:35 - 89:39)
every day and also just walking around (89:37 - 89:41)
South Korea so if you want to see that (89:39 - 89:45)
twitch.tv slash pkmncst (89:41 - 89:47)
um Korea is actually kind of great uh (89:45 - 89:49)
time zone wise because I think it's 14 (89:47 - 89:55)
hour difference so 9 A.M in Korea is 7 (89:49 - 89:58)
P.M Central Time in America (89:55 - 90:01)
uh so pretty much I'm getting up early (89:58 - 90:03)
but streams would be still starting (90:01 - 90:04)
around the same time (90:03 - 90:07)
in the evening it'll just be night for (90:04 - 90:10)
you all and morning for me (90:07 - 90:13)
uh much easier than Germany (90:10 - 90:15)
where it was like (90:13 - 90:20)
10 a.m for me and then like 2 A.M for uh (90:15 - 90:22)
America (90:20 - 90:25)
uh the other thing is uh before we wrap (90:22 - 90:26)
up uh (90:25 - 90:28)

on this week's episode Matt reminding me (91:39 - 91:42)
to mention Ash's Pokemon which I (91:41 - 91:45)
probably would have forgotten uh (91:42 - 91:47)
Brandon's saying I should be talking (91:45 - 91:51)
about this new feature which I am so if (91:47 - 91:53)

I'll update you guys though when the (91:56 - 92:00)
patreon does get revamped I mean (91:58 - 92:01)
obviously the rewards are still pretty (92:00 - 92:03)
good but I want to try to tweak them (92:01 - 92:05)
because you know some things work some (92:03 - 92:06)
things don't the things that don't work (92:05 - 92:08)
we get rid of I replace those with (92:06 - 92:10)
things I think will work better (92:08 - 92:11)
