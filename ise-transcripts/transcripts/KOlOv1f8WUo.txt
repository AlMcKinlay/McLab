[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 390 fourth episode six away from 400 of the Pokemon podcast it's super effective we are recording super early say well try having brunch what this is the Minneapolis brunch hour sir the time when we get brunch car wrecks and everybody else in Minnesota gets frigid cuz brunch is super popular here well is here not having brunch thank you Greg Dankers pointed towards Milwaukee here also not having brunch although surprisingly will and I don't have brunch together that often no well especially since I don't have a car now life extra difficult I also went out to a bar last night so what bar I went to up down oh and I played Dig Dug and I played Frogger and I played arkanoid and I played tapper and I played all my favorite games from when I was eight years old here's my question for you good uh-huh did all the machines work yeah that's a probably the only one that didn't work though that I really wanted to play was moon Patrol that was no no this is panting I tried to play burger time once good burger time and when I did that burger time turning left didn't work oh no no I played burgers huh I did real good I made lots of hamburgers I was so excited with your big buns no but I hit them with pepper so that I could get past them see I was in Minnesota we would all have lunch yeah well cuz we always have Frenchmen Steve comes that's right but but if he was living here that would come to an end because it wouldn't be special oh my god I mean it's barely special that noise that Greg noise is the perfect nice the reason or recording early is because we're recording before the min Chino day in Pokemon go are you doing that yeah I think so it's supposed to be 47 today which is a very water for insanely warm it is very warm or the end of January beginning of February double hoodie bring a scarf maybe a hat has got a nice coat well what if it gets too hot what if those Scouts ended in your car but then then bore them with them to Coleman then you go back to your car and put the coat back on I'm like kind of wrapping a coat around your waist okay look at I'm old we already had boomer talk here prior to you guys playing old classic games that we know we don't need no coat jacket wait okay there's anybody here who aren't boomers it's it's Greg and I all right well past the boomer demographic so thank you a service announcement to all you Millennials out there there is a generation between boomers and Millennials it's called Gen X yeah hey used to being a neglected thing will you we also hate both generations so it's fine that you skip over us because we don't want to talk to either of you anyways and we prefer that you didn't notice us thanks will this do our own thing over here in the corner like you asked us to do anyways we have a lot to get through here Pokemon at home finally has some more details literally every single day of February has a different Pokemon go event there's some new stuff and poke about masters sword shield has an update Shh nah that's not true it's just they change the wild area stuff again but that's kind of like an update it's kind of an update but we're gonna start off with this news sent in by James in our addict channel in our slack community this is off polygons dot-com a new mythical Pokemon for sword and shield to be revealed in February [Music] cool down that I don't have seen issues with this they say nothing about it so hooray ahead of Pokemon Day 2020 which is held on February 27th the Pokemon company wall announced a new mythical Pokemon coming to Pokemon sword and shield will actually probably figure it well actually like boo papa we should know that on February 26 since Japan is in the future I think but but news doesn't travel between Japan and the United cells oh yes that's Chandler and from right there the neglect that we did telling them about the national dex stuff they've refused to share information with us right yes I understand the new Pokemon is expected to start in the upcoming pokémon animated film Coco the announcement was posted in the Japanese on the Japanese official website translated by Pokemon websites Arabi alongside the reveal sword and shield will also get a Mac a special max raid battle so what is that's probably either male metal or tax tricity I'm assuming any of the ones that already exist yeah it's I mean I don't know what I don't know like special means just about anything that doesn't have a help hole describe a new event in Pokemon go will also happen on Pokemon Day which is not part of our Pokemon good news they they seemingly stopped talking about events until up to that day there's no further information to expect from the myth of a creature three legendary pokémon already exist in Pokemon similarly za Chien Zama Zenta and the writer of this article says the two dog like Pokemon they're wolves why are we well I thought like what - does your dog like yeah sure but you could also just say their roles ya know what wolves are anymore that's how disconnected you Zoomers are from nature a mysterious legendary Pokemon called a target us and if you don't know the reason that February 27th is Pokemon Day is because that was one red and green came out in Japan but we didn't get red and green until September 19 right him but we didn't get red and blue until September 1998 in the United States so they did say it's a new Pokemon I guess yeah it can't be melt a normal metal nope it's a wolf with a horn for Lance ah sure so great yep in the unit it's a univille I believe we call those doglike creatures I you and a doglike creature thank you thank you now I understand I would maybe so usually the movie has like the cute mythical like the Celebi or the Victini or the Mew and not like the scary mythical although like the genesect movie I guess exists QT yeah well the baby genocide is very cute Volcarona that's them that didn't have a movie the sudden volcania Bagheera it was the Cutie in that what cute I mean it was a volcanion McGee ran a movie yeah I mean definitely it was definitely a movie that's for sure definitely just don't know how to appreciate real art hmm oh I disagree interesting speaking of cuties nil sorry sure can we talk about Missouri's name I don't think we ever did sure why what about it it's milk it's milk yeah so al creme e is alchemy if you don't know the pun in mil sorry I don't think we said on the show the pun and mil sorry is sorcery so it's out alchemy and sorcery so me that's it's milk sorcery it's a different school some milk like but wait why didn't they just name it sorcery cuz it looks like it's a sauce no it's a milk it's milk or yessiree sounds more like sorcery than Mill siree sounds like taste of loathing already has a saucer and there's probably legal ramifications for that who does but you don't use loathing you don't what you don't use sauce to make cake maybe you don't use sauce to make a cake I didn't sauce to make a cake if you've never had wills spaghetti sauce cake not sue are you gonna tell me that chocolate ganache is not a sauce this is a breakfast dish but ganache is a kind of sauce look long buddy there are places we don't go and that's one of them ganache is that a sauce it's a whipped frosting filling well if you go to the wild area hot dogs a taco okay if we're gonna break down all rules of law sure Nilsa read the adorable cream Pokemon not to be confused with that could have been the adorable milk Pokemon but continuing will be featured in pokemon sword and shield max raid battles from January 30th to February 16th special mill sari will appear in dens throughout the wild area these mill Suri will be able to Giganta max after evolving into outcry me also when you win a max raid battle against mill suri during this time you may receive various sweets as rewards these include star sweets and ribbon sweets both which could not be obtained before have no siree hold a different kind of sweet and evolve them into the many forms of alchemy to get some valuable advice for tracking these challenging matcha that's why Pokemon are you lying to us there's nothing challenging be sure to read our max battle tip article and don't wait these mill series will only appear in max rate battles for a limited time don't miss your chance to catch them I've got a bunch yesterday I got a writ that gave me four sweets you want every L creamy with every sweet in every flavor you would need 63 mil Suri's unless what yeah that's out of control you already got all the very sweet mil Suri's over the last two to three weeks when those were promoted then you only need 54 but if you needed the shinies as well which is another seven then you back up to 63 if you didn't do any of the elk Rama's before and you decided today is the day you want to dive into madness of collecting all of them including shinies you would need 70 total mil Suri's and who says there isn't anything to do after you've meteor core it's a lot and a lot of them I don't like so I'm just gonna do the ones that I do like and be done remember like my salted cream star who's cute with yellow eyes remember when they showed like 14 viv Leone's and everyone was like who wants the catch-all certain people yes I will wait for the 14 I think it's like actually 16 I think there is 14 initially and then there was 2 distribution ones I think there were 20 maybe there is I thought there was like 20 or 24 oh don't tell me this I'm waiting for who cares about Diamond Pro remix who cares about Gen 5 remix give me the X&Y remix so we can get back to catching the viv Leone's said no one ever why not 20 there's 20 are you waiting clearing the special ones the pote like the pokeball one yeah oh there's only one special ones just wait not fancy was special yeah there's fancy and pokeball those were the two special then there's river monsoon savannah sun ocean jungle sandstorm high plains archipelago marine modern icy snow meadow polar tundra continental garden and elegant all right now do all the i'll creme ease salted star so we're we don't have to we have too much news we don't have time for this no yeah yeah they're very true uh if you are not seeing the mill Suri's the same thing i've told people before go to the wild area news under mystery gift hit update wild area news you might have to clear out the current raids that exists so just by hitting that button doesn't suddenly change your raids it will update it and then you will have to probably clear them all out by either doing them or doing your friends raids which we've talked about before you have two raids left and you've already checked them and they end up being a five-star gold bass : and a three-star stunk tank once you check them if you do two of your friends raids that will clear out your raids or you just do them yourself whatever works for you but that should pop it up overall though you know we're a little bit we're almost three three months with this game and they're changing wild area pretty frequently you could maybe argue that these two things were not in the game now they're in the game so it's new content I don't know I think it's great I don't have any problem with it for somebody who continues to my Pokemon everyday it's really nice to be like hey there's new max raids I will say it injects like for this first few days when it happens it's like there's people everywhere and it's super exciting and then much like Pokemon go towards the end of the raids it's like is there anybody that can help no no and it's like these things I don't see them lining up with Mondays and Monday is raid night in Minnesota so I need them to orient them more towards Monday evenings thank you if if Pokemon is doing is adding raids and stuff well they are obviously we keep talking about them and it gets somebody to come back to the game for a even even a day or two that's more than what the old games were doing oh yeah I mean they're definitely adding value I mean value like the problem is is that once you get the one that you want like there's not a lot of reason to keep doing it yep and once you have the suite that you want and you use it on the mystery that you want then you're done yeah and it's like you know I'm tired of running into GMAX Lapras I'm tight it's like okay right a lot of these GMAX pokeman I've lasted like a month which i think is up is fine I mean that's how Pokemon go does it with like their tornadoes tornadoes is gonna be the next month long Pokemon I think that's fine you're gonna see people that get really excited to at the beginning there's gonna be that middle area where no one's doing it and then it's gonna be like atoms in two days everyone I didn't get it yet yeah I just wished that instead of swapping all four at the month they swapped two and then two weeks later they swapped two because of military yeah but I mean so that this is one and we're still with colossal we're still with all the others I wish it would just wrote a couple would rotate on a more frequent basis that would just make it feel more fresh I think so I have a question I have two questions here number one are the different mill Sarita elk Ramiz is it says is that just cosmetic yeah it's just cosmetic all right so I don't need to waste my time with that garbage number two GMAX flappable GMAX Appleton churros have been featured still re up until a la February 8th I think why do they both look exactly the same I hate I hate that the G max looks the same for both I don't know it's like they went back in the Apple I'm like you got out of the Apple dude don't go back into the Apple they went back in the apples of the sweet sweet caramel I know it's all gooey and everything I know who comes out whenever they like do a special or something oh it's kind of hard to watch and then Greg that one that we did together on Friday night I didn't catch it I think cuz I was like I'm gonna get an Appleton I don't care about the G max I'm gonna get an Appleton and I got no Appleton yeah I'd do it again it's hard enough to get me to play this game at all yet I made it to the outside of Rose tower and I was walking around picking up the stuff off the ground that's out there so probably tomorrow I'll go inside of Rose tower but tomorrow night's right night Morrow morning Oh hmm then you're fine maybe no well there's nothing about the post game that was gonna like you never know you never maybe when I just find something charming I am feared and I really like it or really hate it I mean between the two Beth hairstyles are about to appear in the post game I don't care about hairstyles I don't shave head thing in my game just like I do really no you'll care about these okay you won't believe number two you won't you and not believe number two this is off Destructoid is that still a thing yes sir they still got a little robot face yeah so does mr. reddit Nintendo calls Pokemon sword and shield a huge hit as it breaks 16 a million sales guess that uh boycott didn't but nobody told Japan no until you came to boy coming yeah what he told so I mean that's clearly through the lies and deception they made their money in its third quarter earnings release Nintendo announced that Pokemon sword and shield predictably led the way in sales racking up sixteen point zero six million units sold between mid November and its end of 2019 calendar year it broke down between four point two million sales in Japan and eleven point eight five million sales throughout the rest of the world I don't think Japan was the problem here it's enough for Nintendo to single out the new pokemon calling it a huge hit pokemon sword and shield fared better than Pokemon Sun and Moon during its launch quarter Sun and Moon combined sold fourteen point six nine million cut nice copies on the 3ds and it currently sits at sixteen point one eight million sales meaning sword and shield has pasta has surpassed Sun and moons lifetime sales once January's figures have been totaled in it goes I'm talking about how Luigi's Mansion three did 5.3 million Super Mario maker - did five million Link's Awakening did four million Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is up to 22 million Wow geez that's a good game though is it on if you play it on the switch can let's play with you I might I love my wii you don't you don't rush on that I refuse to buy Mario Kart again idea that's kind of where I was there's a new one coming Mario Kart 9 is gonna come on the switch like December I'll buy it then yeah we get to get back into like when we used to do like Mario Kart on Wednesday nights yeah we might get together and cart it up I mean how disappointed was I that I was on an airplane when I did Pierce's gym and I couldn't hear his rockin Rock oh there was no rock and rocky how would you know you never play with the sound I played the whole game with this add-on I continued playing with the sound on and that hard to believe but the only thing I've done is I've turned down the sound effects because I think the whoever designed the audio in that game needs to be fired the sound effects it like the like menu items are so maybe miss mr. Matsuda maybe I don't think he did the he might've did the music I don't know if he did like what I'm talking about it's like that menu things like when you select something or when you're going up and down like that's also ear piercing to me and I don't know why I never even noticed any kind of noise at all so it's your youthful ears maybe I just again we always we always we always go through this kind of stuff let's go Pikachu let's go Eevee did 11.76 million ultra son alternates Evan Sun and Moon sixteen point one eight this is actually these aren't fully updated but they're doesn't matter no one needs argue about the point whatever zero zero that comes after X&Y is sixteen point four four million black and white fifteen point six four diamond and pearl seventeen point six seven Ruby and Sapphire sixteen point two two so it looks like sword and shield it will probably be on track here too well they already passed sudden moon they are probably gonna pass X&Y is adjusted for inflation oh are you talking about price yeah I think it's copies it's not it's not exactly how many copies they've sold again not sure if it's gonna pass diamond pearl here with seventeen point six seven the the the more interesting conversation is like how many 3d asses existed in the world compared to how many switches exist in the world right now because Sun and Moon was near the end of the 3ds lifecycle which maybe this is percentage market shares what we're talking about here here we go which could hurt it to be like no one wants to play 3ds games anymore that's why it didn't sell as well as X&Y I doubt that I mean a Pokemon fan is a Pokemon fan and very few people hated the 3ds as much as you did so that's true it's yeah I did not the 3d well I like the VDS it just it went it lived too long don't fib you did not like the 3ds you did not hold love for it in your heart I like yeah me too you know you know what I liked about the 3ds as I went to the auto mechanic on Friday afternoon you could put the 3ds in your pocket and it was relatively in a truce unobtrusive you put a big ole switch in your pocket and everybody's like Mae West what put things in their pockets anymore you gotta have the either the Sandy pack or the backpack oh heck no no that's you Millennials and you boomers with your fanny packs and backpacks s Gen Xers are like put it in your pocket or don't care at all I mean I did buy a nutsack but I don't use it I should use it in the summer but I don't mmm the other side I'm moving on very quickly for my statement the other side of the coin here is just the amount of bad press prior to this game compared to other games in the series like the most you've heard complaining about Sun and Moon like the hand holding at the beginning or how like it was so tutorial eyes at least with the X&Y that I remember I don't know if you guys remember differently was just the lack of postgame specifically in X&Y was the huge complaint there but with sword and shield there was obviously we don't have to go in depth of the narrative it existed we lived through it but the narrative that existed on Twitter and reddit and because Game Freak didn't control the message or some people believe that because Game Freak didn't control the message or hashtag Game Freak lied that that was her that would hurt sales when in reality that didn't happen and I think I think that just overall shows how it correct me if I'm wrong how a very very small percentage of people were very very loud and even though they were loud it didn't affect the fan that walks in buys a Pokemon game gets to the end of the game plays it satisfy it puts it down goes back to apex legends when they're done nobody's going back to apex which is I think what it really is a testament to is the old phrase there's no such thing as bad press and all of these people fussing and moaning raise attention to the fact of hey there's a new pokemon yeah and people who just didn't care we're like they got they got their attention like where they might not have gotten their attention before I also think the thing that they were complaining about a lot of people didn't care about Oh like not having a Pokemon yeah like you don't have that until the end of the game anyways so for a vast majority of people that wasn't gonna be a big issue and the complaints about this texture or that texture or these trees or that trees don't bother a ton of people the game looks great like its it's a very cartoon cell shade style and if you don't like that style you're never gonna like that style but for a lot of people that's a really attractive style and you expect sort of a cartoony feel and it gives that so I think a lot of the complaints just didn't resonate with a vast majority of people I'd you know as somebody who played Arkanoid last night and had a heck of a time they say once again if you know it's not one rectangle bouncing against another rectangle on the screen I'm thrilled you know y'all have your expectations are set way too high but Greg the but the post on writer got 2000 up votes about how the title screen and sword and shield was uninspired and bad I like it my panel stadium no yeah I like the title screen too but that was actually one of the things I mean sure I could I could go and probably get a ton of votes on something that I want to pick apart like that's not it's not hard to find a small minority of people to agree with you especially if you're gonna be super negative about something very popular that's like the easiest get in the world well speaking of Pokemon fans getting mad okay they announced Pokemon Homes pricing oh now here's where you're gonna get me all charged up so we're gonna take a quick break and when we come back I have the press release here for Pokemon home we're gonna go through this and what we know what we don't know yet but yeah let's take a quick break and when we get back we will talk about Pokemon home [Music] deciduous said she got evergreen they got deciduous said she got evergreen [Music] No [Music] Pokemon home to launch in February 2020 yeah no date yet on February 7th press release here today the Pope this was on January 28th today the Pokemon company International and Nintendo has announced more details for a new cloud service app Pokemon home the app enables trainers to continue their Pokemon adventures beyond a single game system and manage their collection of pokemon across many of their games pokemon home will launch february 2024 iPhone iPad and Android devices as well as the Nintendo switch system this is just an apple thing but I'm very curious if the iPhone and iPad app apps will be different because they listed them differently into this instead of just saying iOS or if the iPad app is just gonna be like a glorified iPhone app I mean I don't know what they would make different well like well using the actual I look because the iPad has gestures and has abilities to like multitask and stuff also if it's not if it's a dedicated iPhone app on the iPad and you have to use the I want to expand this to fill the screen that's always waffle like Instagram on an iPad is just a disgrace designed as a place where all pokémon can gather Pokemon home will enable trainers to bring over pokemon from linked pokemon series games and deposit them in boxes in the cloud or move them around to linked compatible games by linking the same Nintendo account to both the Nintendo switch and the mobile device version fans will be able to access the same Pokemon boxes from both hardware platforms the Nintendo switch version of Pokemon home supports connectivity with the Nintendo switch games pokemon sword Pokemon shield Pokemon let's go Pikachu and let's go Eevee both Nintendo's switched versions and the mobile device version of Pokemon home will support connectivity with the 3d software pokemon bank support for Pokemon go is in development like last week I bet this launches with up a go uhh it's fine it's fine it's not the end of the world I need space yes ok I can't disagree with you but you can just buy the space Greg it's permanent you don't have to pay a yearly fee for it you can just give me antique money I fully maxed out my Pokemon storage space and I still run out of space for poke I mean I haven't gotten I refuse to buy more storage space because I I'm already mad that I'm carrying like 15 Chinese squirtle that I will do nothing with other than I would like to put them into something where I can trade them to people and I can't and I'm not gonna be able to win this launches on February 7th turn them into delicious candy do it Greg candy squirtle candies no they're shiny and spangled can't believe you yeah you got to throw them up on eBay with all the shiny no max chars learns that exists will do Pokemon sword and Pokemon shield can link to the Nintendo switch a version of Pokemon home once the games are linked users can deposit and retrieve Pokemon obtained using those games Pokemon let's go Pikachu and Pokemon let's go Eevee can link to the Nintendo switch version of Pokemon home users can move Pokemon back and forth between let's go Pikachu and let's go Eevee or into Pokemon sword and shield once a pokemon from let's go Pikachu or let's go Eevee is moved into Pokemon sword or Pokemon shield it cannot be returned to its original game this is not new this is what's happened when you moved a Pokemon from Ruby and Sapphire into diamond pearl or a Pokemon from x & y into Sun and Moon if a user is enrolled in a premium plan parentheses and parentheses they will be able to move Pokemon from the Nintendo 3ds titles to Pokemon home using Pokemon bank once a Pokemon from bank has moved into Pokemon home it cannot Ruby returned to Pokemon bank to celebrate the release of Pokemon home Pokemon bank and Pokemon transporter will be available at no cost for one month after home is released trainers will be able to bring over Pokemon from various series using Pokemon bank and transporter once they have Pokemon and Pokemon bank then they will be able to move their Pokemon - Pokemon home so do I get a refund on all the money I put into Pokemon Bank all these years no you were paying and actively using that service will actively using as a bit of a stretch but sure you could have cancelled at any time I was passively using the service thank you that's like having a Netflix subscription for like two years and being like hey can I get my money back I actually didn't watch any I've had my neighbor totoro out for a decade now and I haven't watched it give me my money back what if I mail it back in and I never watched it I think I should get a refund okay for ten years and never watch it it's good it's not that good okay you can see here's the trick with DVDs while the content of the DVD may be the most incredible fantastic work of art and genius and emotionally grabbing all of it none of that bears any fruit until the DVD is placed into a DVD player the DVD is played I haven't been motivated to go that far so it's it's right it's right there in front of my television just even but the the PlayStation the PlayStation will do it my xbox will do it there are four weights ways to trade easily Pokemon home on a mobile device they make this pot this makes it possible to trade Pokemon anywhere in any time let's watch this fail Pokemon place in a wonder box can be treated around the world Pokemon place in a wonder box will even be traded to Pokemon when Pokemon home is not being used with the GTS it's back that was a complaint that is why sword and shield wasn't gonna sell well Greg because they took out the GTS I mean I don't disagree but then they brought it back not even every month later for free well free no it's completely free don't even start real cost of a if only I made a very handy graphic that you can see of the prices I saw that graphic I think that's a manipulation of of reality right there fans can specify which Pokemon they want to trade in which Pokemon they want to receive they will match with a trainer if both meet each other's criteria I'm let's see how long before it's just riddled with nothing but RNG hacked Pokemon two minutes after long exactly me to level two Mewtwo's only please will trade level alive shiny mcgee r 'no i will say look for those not only did what i discovered today was not only did I accidentally breed one shiny jewel tick I accidentally braided two shiny ticks without realizing it so one of those may show up on the GTS as a completely legitimate because I don't need more than one shiny jewel tick I mean keep one a jolt I can make the other Galvan Chula you got to keep it so it appreciates in value yeah like you're gonna hit me yeah exactly then you can put on eBay I mean one of them is gonna be a galvan Chula because the whole reason I'm doing this is so I can have a shiny bug team for my shield playthrough so yeah I mean I have to evolve it so I can beat peers room trade lets you tray it let's trainers create a room and trade pokémon with people who join each room can hold up to 20 people trading in trade rooms have no cost but users will only be able to create a room if they're enrolled in the premium plan and then Fred trade allows trainers to trade their Pokemon with nearby users when they have become friends with them in Pokemon home trainers can be traders can add friends using the add front friend feature in Pokemon home oh good another friends list I know I was just like so I can't just import my switch faceless I couldn't import my sword and shield I do I do want to say I like the like the room feature because it kind of reminds me I can't remember if it was diamond and pearl or black and white I'm pretty sure about that in light where you would actually go into a special room and like walk up to the person I'm sure they both actually to trade with them and everything I thought that was like really cute and I kind of missed that but you also have no control over what you're gonna get in room trade so I'm so excited to flood STIs games with all my hacked Pokemon yes let me tell you what i shiny Mewtwo I hope there's more to rim trade than what they've said because I think having 20 people in a room and I did picture what will said like the black and white thing of walking around I think that's cool but if it's just if it's not actually a room and it's just like it's not actually 20 people in it like let's be real remember how you used to be able to get like make your own like special catchphrase and like I would show up like when you battle for somebody or it's like mine was like I like happiness and smiles and the happiness and smiles are all what a ridiculous phrase I want that to come back that was fun people were really creative with that stuff well well there are more features here that we can talk about Pokemon home will be registered to the National pokedex where people can deposit them in boxes in Pokemon home if a user deposits a pokémon that can mega evolve our Giganta max then these forms will also be registered in the National pokedex trainers will be able to see the pokedex entries from various games all in one place with the pokemon with the mobile device version of Pokemon home users will also be able to search by pokemons abilities and moves why can't I do that on the sweet ok yeah there's some issues here but well continue why don't they have also and this is where you tap a button to hear their name pronounced oh boy yeah well again who will see I milk arey milk Oh our trainers can receive mystery gifts in the mobile device versions of Pokemon home with this feature they can receive mystery gifts for Pokemon sword and Pokemon shield as well as gifts specifically for Pokemon home Pokemon received in Pokemon home can directly be deposited in a box in Pokemon home trainers can also receive some gifts such as items for Pokemon by receiving a code for a mystery gift in home and then using that code in pokemon sword and shield a little confusing but okay sure if a trainer has enrolled in the premium plan they will have access to the judge function which will allow them to check how strong their Pokemon are in your room tab trainers will be able to see all sorts of information about events or games they've connected a Pokemon home it will also be able to edit their profile using stickers they can obtain stickers in Pokemon home when they meet certain current conditions or perform certain tests known as challenges decorations behind a paywall this is the worst not that this does not say premium Greg yeah but the best stickers are gonna be for premium users those never said that

popular among Pokemon in competition in Pokemon home for mobile devices the trainers will be able to receive news for Pokemon being distributed as gifts and information about online competitions for Pokemon sword and Pokemon shield Pokemon home points our points that are accumulate in Pokemon home as trainers deposit more Pokemon when using the switch version of Pokemon home trainers will be able to exchange home points for battle points to be used in core series Pokemon games so they basically taken all the stuff that was on the global link that they've decided to turn off and moved it over into Pokemon home and it does the same thing with battle points that Pokemon bank did yes what about all the points that I built up in Pokemon bank that I never used cash them out for sorta it was cash them out for Sun and Moon yeah I had this argument with various amounts of people that were like I have 8000 battle points and Pokemon bank I can't wait to catch the 9000 I can't wait to cash them out and sword and shield and I was like you're good I've learned anything about Pokemon this is the same company that has made me collect Jenna sex dumb little disk drives in every game hey you need a flame orb great you can get that in every version of the game because you're not gonna be able to transfer it over I'm aware hey you know all that money you have in Sun and Moon it's staying in Sun and Moon oh well cuz those are a Lola box oh and now I need Galler bucks that's actually why I'm a fan like I I'm excited for the expansion and that regards of like oh cool I don't have to worry about rebuilding up all my wats in a new game or all my money in a new game or rebind all the clothes that I've bought in this game in the new game even though a lot of the clothes will be the same or like a third version I should say you wanna hear pricing I mean if you want to hear me scream yell and shout yeah go right ahead one month $2.99 three months $4.99 twelve months $15.99 so clarify this for me it's $15.99 int on top of the Nintendo online but Nintendo online is not necessarily required to use Pokemon home correct switch you didn't rat need a Nintendo online to use this I just this this was my argument before though Y if if I was just a Pokemon go player why would they forced me to get Nintendo online if I don't have a switch okay that's that's fine I that and from that perspective of the person who's only a Pokemon go player I would also question if I was a Pokemon go player the injustice of other Pokemon players getting a very very similar service not completely similar but I mean exactly the same but very similar service at the main point being online storage of my Pokemon for five dollars a year for so many years and now I just want to be able to store my c'mon and maybe do some trades although I can trade in Pokemon go so whatever for three times as much per year yeah I want to point out that Pokemon bank one is seven years old and two never changed in seven years so like I got a fancy distribution of psycho distributions from they've got distributions but that actual app never changed okay correct but this is the this is the question that I have to ask myself when I'm looking at this price is they're three times more content that's worth it then Bank so if you're paying five dollars to store in Bank and that never ever changed and that's all you're going to do is paying fifteen well sixteen dollars basically I don't know I said fifteen that's the way it's annoying is that price point something that's worth it like the question becomes all of these other functions that they're adding in are they worth three times the price which we can't tell into which I don't access to the product yes I mean I I think it's I think it's fine but I do think it's it is at the very upper limit of what they could get away with I think my upper limit would have been 20 oh I don't think anybody would about in for 20 I mean I would have yeah I know no we know I would have because we're idiots keep supporting this pokemons our Pokemon Laura and Master and whatever they want to do to us I think it would have been better closer to 10 or 12 I attend yes I think 10 would have been my optimal price point right yeah I mean I think they're put I think they're really pushing it and they're relying on all these other features being so spectacular that you don't let you feel like you're getting value out of it like what they're showing is like okay this used to be free in the other games like the GS was always there and the GTS is completely free you don't have to pay for anything you do have to pay for certain aspects of it no you don't ability to do certain things no if you want to just use this as the GTS you can deposit one Pokemon at a time correct which is there in how it always was in all the games there's no cost of that but there is additional features if you pay yeah but that's how everything is yeah but I'm saying it's it there is still the there is still the view and what they're showing that you aren't getting the full GTS because there is a part that is behind a paywall whether or not that's what it used to do there is a part of what is details behind a paywall that you can do to extra yeah well there you go and especially like if I'm like trying to empty out my boxes and stuff like that and in like a fun way yeah I'm gonna have to pay for those two extra slots so what like why like I don't think that's a valid complaint to be like oh and they're charging me for two extra spots because that's brand-new it is a valid complaint because what I'm saying is people don't will no longer look at it used to be a one on one thing what they will see is there is another functionality behind a paywall whether or not that's new or not isn't part of that complaint the complaint is there are features from a thing that used to be free that are now behind a paywall whether or not that's that's a one for one thing doesn't matter that is the viewpoint that exists yeah people aren't people aren't you who are looking at the you know have this whole like studied history of everything that happened and did it happen but I mean the average person is not like that and what they're doing is like if they looked at Sun and Moon they probably didn't look at Sun and Moon to say what GTS features are there but here we're looking at Pokemon home and G the GTS feature is a prominent component of that so of course they have to look at that and now they're saying well waive the the the free people get one and the pay-for people get three for $15 but like my whole problem with us right it's not it's not really even the price point obviously I can pay $15 all right that's sectional change I drop really nice always 60 no you know the other day but [Music] $14.99 would have been so much easier it's okay my issue is and this is like the first reaction that I had when I saw this price point is number one the Pokemon games are aren't cheap right how much did I pay for there's no different than any other game I don't like that is a good boy once again I live in a pokémon only world so there's six dollars like every single xbox360 one game in my life i play pokemon that's the only get and i barely play that $60 okay and then to get the full experience of playing pokemon that I already paid $60 on my $300 which I had to pay 20 more dollars a year to get pokken Nintendo online so I don't have to pay $5 to get the full experience okay that that okay I hate this complaint because that has nothing to do with Pokemon you want to play Monster Hunter generations ultimate guess what you also have to have Nintendo's which I am I am I am accusing the entire Nintendo world because this is this is where I'm gonna get to alright so and now I had to do another $15 for the for the full complete Pokemon experience and actually it was like 120 because I have have to get sort of shield cuz I got to be one of the cool kids but comparatively but what's my reaction was is what we're approaching is I pay what $60 a year for PS Plus mm-hmm and I get I feel like I get a heck of a lot more for PS Plus for my $60 then my now $35 that's going for Nintendo online services is getting me okay but that has nothing to do with Game Freak now I know but that's fine it's it's this is this is an economic discussion I'm not in I'm not accusing gamefreak of anything I'm just saying the value proposition that I am now getting from the Nintendo Pokemon universe is approaching the cost of a PS plus service or an Xbox Live service but the value that I'm getting is is reducing in equivalency so that I actually get I can see myself as getting more value from PS plus for my dollar than I am getting from Nintendo online services including Pokemon bank and you know whatever else Animal Crossing if I invest in that particular title or anything like that that is just like I looking at the history of what we got from Nintendo and Pokemon it's it's like they're the way it used to be was they could be seen as not the money grubbers that they were like generous with when you bought your game they were very generous with what you got from them whereas Xbox and Playstation we're very sort of on the greedy side of we're gonna nickel-and-dime you for every little thing that comes down the line and it's like as nintendo becomes more appears to become more greedy i don't feel like i'm getting the same amount of value no of course that's my like first visceral reaction down the line I may be thrilled if I may you know maybe Pokemon home will be a continuing continually developing software so that they'll add in new features and new services over time although they never did with Pokemon bank so little hope for that and then it'll be like worth my dollar just from the outset my first reaction that I see this is like they're asking for more money and they're just not giving me the same amount of value from it so we'll have to see also the xxx Pokemon storage - six Tests book about sorry just like wait like while this issue it's one box so I might get a box am I getting a new professor wearing Crocs or is the same Pokemon bank wearing Crocs I don't know what about yeah please room here bridgett will be a 499 micro transaction Bridget's not even a tree she does it she does not wear a racket why does she wear she's very accepting white Roxy look heard TCG card is definitely not safe for work oh she is wearing Crocs oh she's wearing uh it's like it's a sari she's wearing while she's wearing a dress and it's just like a blue coat it's like a blue sweater coat difference between basic and premium so if you're in the basic plan that you are not allowed to move from Pokemon bank although logistically this is going to happen once for the majority of people right yes this is gonna be a one-time thing if you are if you are upset about the sixteen dollars I'm trying to think about this in like a sense of like well they're already giving everyone a month free of bank and they're already giving everyone a month free of home there's a month free of home when I think ending a month free of bank yeah that's what I said the beginning yeah oh yeah yeah they are and that's why I was complaining that I should get my money back they did say they're giving it I don't know I don't remember what I read they did say they're giving away a month free of home when it comes out right yeah the first 30 days so you can try it so completely for free you can move all your Pokemon and Pokemon home to Pokemon bank for Pokemon bank to Pokemon home completely for free if you are don't pay for bank and you don't pay for home realistically if you once you do that you can stop paying for bank altogether I mean I also have been so much you have in your bank because you only if you're not paying you have spots for 30 and that's it well you got what so this is how it worked in huh Bank we don't know that my assumption is you can you can throw it all in there because you have 6,000 in the during your free trial and then if you don't move them you can't put any more in but you can still take them out because that's how Bank works if you stop paying for Bank you can't put anything else in but you can still withdraw all that stuff eventually so you can withdraw all your things into sword and shield granted it's one of the 400 Pokemon that exist although I guess you can go up to about 600 Pokemon once the expansion comes out for the they have to they have to know their number like they have to know how many people use Bank daily monthly yearly how many people actually transfer Pokemon from X & Y to Sun and Moon because that you could only do that with bank so they must know in a sense like who's using what service and if then like how did they go from 30 to 6000 like I can't imagine that's just one box is fine they must know that like there are two types of audiences there's an audience that just uses very little and then there's the hardcore audience that has thousands of thousands of Pokemon maybe not I don't know well I would say the Pokemon games have generally been antagonistic about carrying Pokemon forward I mean just if you think about moving from gen 4 to Gen 5 and you had to do that stupid uh shoot the arrow oh man they did not want you to move those Pokemon forward yeah I mean this is where I would say like I would literally pay for convenience like he could I don't want to shoot my arrows at six Pokemon at a time go back out grab another six shoot some arrows like my time like sixteen dollars to not do that for four Pokemon sign me up yeah but you also hate money no I don't hate money but like my time is is valuable and there's like nothing fun about that specific minigame to like move Pokemon over and don't get me started how to move Pokemon over from Platinum to or from diamond a pearl the whole silver that was like let's take the six Pokemon drop them in this bad safari zone you have to find them throw a Pokeball and then come back when to catch ugh four times longer than the arrow game I at least got good at the arrow game at that point so again I am coming from like Geoff's sure if this is instant and I can just pay for it and I don't have to go through any minigames I guess the argument would be like well why don't we just have none of that I was like yeah I guess you could also have none of that in basic you can have three Pokemon in a wonder box and premium you can have ten in basic you could have one Pokemon in the GTS premium you can have three in basic you can participate in room trades in premium you can participate and host room trades and then in basic you cannot access the judge in premium you can access the judge again you're just paying for convenience there you can still access the judge normally and sword and shield once you go through your six battles in a battle tower now that I saw some people were upset about the judge thing being behind a paywall but sign up for any podcast service you what you want stats that's an extra two bucks you want some premium stats that's an extra five bucks like it's literally just data they hide behind like this the Pokemon company is not the first corporation out there to hide a step behind the paywall it's goes far beyond that and my one example of podcasting I don't think the GTS is as big as the deal as you're making it Greg I'm just not that big of a deal I'm just saying I'm just saying when people want big deal to me Greg I am a big deal but no I'm saying when people look at the pricing when they see things are blocked off that is where that complaint sure when they see you get when they see you get something more and having to pay for it it doesn't matter that the basic is what you used to get there is still the perception and the FOMO of what I want that and I have to pay a lot of money for it on top of everything else one a one in the GTS is what it used to be is fine it you probably won't ever use it but the fact that there are functions of these things locked behind premium creates a feeling of I have to pay to get full access and that leaves a sour taste in people's mouth I think like the GCS shouldn't have had like extra leave that I just leave it the way it was because it used to exist before I yeah and and it would have helped that perception some but it's not a big deal like I'm not actually upset about it I'm just saying that that that that that feeds into the view of things being locked away from people which isn't helpful and the pricing is it is expensive like it is an upper limit of what I think they could get away with I think it's slightly overpriced but not outrageously enough to stop a lot of people paying for it it just it feels like oof that's a lot of money for what am I really gonna use it for well okay so if Pokemon bank was five dollars for ultimately all you got was three thousand spaces that was it so at ten dollars you're getting double that which I think in that if we're only looking at those two variables I'm sure there's one person listening being like well I they didn't get my five other people who thought that was overpriced there are always you people who thought that was overpriced but for me the five dollars for three thousand was awesome since day one you know even if you were to go back in this podcast like six years ago like eight years ago when I was like the only thing I really wanted out of Pokemon it's like a cloud solution where I can put all my Pokemon some sick of transferring them from game to game and shooting arrows so five dollars a year gets you three thousand spaces if we were to double that to $10 zero that gives you six thousand spaces and there were fans including myself that was like three thousand ain't cutting it anymore especially with Pokemon go being something that we know is going to transfer in because I'm almost at three thousand alone in Pokemon go and I need to dump those Pokemon somewhere so is then the $6 so let's just pretend everyone was ok with that I don't know if everyone is ok with that but I think that's a fair assessment based on the history of last 7 years double the space double the money devil space double the money fine so what is that extra $6 get you you could argue the judge function so you can check without actually moving it into a game the judge function became incredibly easy once Sun and Moon came out it still a pain in the butt in X&Y where you had to talk to a specific person and they were still very vague about it so judge function has been good since Sun and Moon let's go sword and shield that's an one extra step you don't need to do if they add the judge function there but on top of that they've also added a mobile app so you could maybe argue that the fact that you can now see this on your phone or your iPad or your or whatever is the extra six dollars the difference is here between the Nintendo search and the phone version the Nintendo switch will let you move Pokemon the Nintendo switch will let you move Pokemon between let's go Pikachu let's go Eevee and sword and shield you can not do that using the phone both the Nintendo switch and the mobile phone version will let you access and move from Pokemon Bank which is interesting and don't know what that means exactly but okay the judge function will be accessible through both if you decide to pay for that you cannot trade Pokemon from Pokemon home from the switch itself you can from the mobile version I guess this makes sense because they want you to do it in the actual game so that's fine I guess I don't know if that's like a technical issue or they just want you to go back to the game yeah I don't know that's weird they they probably just like with all the things that they had to program for this they were like that functionality already exists on the switch let's not prioritize doing that on the switch and it's probably to future-proof of like yeah hey and we want the trading will probably be different in other games going forward after certain shields so we don't want to fine you cannot receive mystery gifts via this Nintendo switch version but you can on the mobile version again that's weird but also they probably want you to use the mystery gift function and sword and shield specifically so I program it again you cannot check battle data on the Nintendo switch version but you can on the phone no news at Linda tempo search version but you can on the phone there's an already a news program on the switch that no one ever checks so I don't sure and then on the descendants which version you can exchange home points for battle points you can not do that on the phone so that all makes sense I'd be curious if they did like them if they were going to do a middle tier plan of like hey this is just Pokemon bank for the switch no phone version and make it cheaper because I think that's maybe where some people are getting held up of why it's I do think 16 is up is high I don't have any problem paying for it because yeah Pokemon is like my number one game in life you know when I mean I don't have problem paying for it I do think it is the very upper limit of what the kick it away with I just don't understand why it's not 15 it's just so weird odor but what if there was yeah if there was maybe like $10 a year and it was just here's everything here's the six thousand spots here's the switch but you don't get access to that phone version because I'm actually I think that's that's such a big selling point to me is having everything on my phone and being able to trade from my phone like I think that in itself was worth the $6 and I think double the space to me was worth the $10 and that's why I don't think I'm in Terra entirely mad about the entire thing I just don't know if the trading function is worth $6 I just don't know trading from your phone you mean sorry yeah training from my phone is I honestly think the whole the whole mobile phone aspect of it is going to be so new to us it's really hard to judge how we're going to pay functionality whatever but it's like we can't really judge how we're gonna feel about the mobile phone functionality until we have it in our hands right and we either say wow this was done super fantastic it is worth every penny or wow I can't believe they consider this to be a mobile app right yeah 2020 I mean like see the honestly you're ever gonna use the wonder box no are you ever gonna use the GTS maybe so I was very against GTS and sword and shield specifically because sorry I'm Sun and Moon specifically because I I like catching pokémon myself so there's very there's never a situation where I'm like I'm missing a Pokemon I need to go to the GTS but the GTS did help me out a lot in trading my Pokemon that I bred to people who watch my twitch stream yeah and then you throw away their Pokemon right well that's still a problem I have with the game where you have to trade a Pokemon for a Pokemon but if I was like trading own tempo rock rough which you cannot wonder trade which we'll find out once this goes up if if that'll be able to be Wonder trade so own tempo rock rough you can't wonder trade you can only you can GTS it though so I was breeding own tempo rock rough for people who watch my twitch stream you know I got egg moves on it I got good Ivy's on it I got it in a moon ball and so all they had to do was upload baska lens to the GTS and then ask for rock roughs under level 5 and I was able to find them find their masculine 's they named their bass colognes is C and boom I could trade them they didn't have to worry about waiting they could just put on the GTS come like go get dinner come back and when they came back they got a rock rough is impossible for me to do this in sort and shield which is like a streamer complaint of like sure a total understand so I'm so I might be able to benefit from GTS here even though that was something like oh I I don't care about the GTS some people were very excited GTS what came back but if this is a way for me to breed 30 gallery' and courses move them into Pokemon home switch over to home search for bass : named is sea level 20 they're asking for glare in corsola under 1 and I can just do trades that's awesome but I don't like that was never a selling point to Pokemon home for me and so room trades look what they're presenting you enter in a room and then basically a wonder trade happens amongst the people that you know yeah that's fine fun like it seems like a gimmick that most people would use once and then never again like you know we're going to make it a tradition at Minnesota Sunday brunch is we're gonna do room trades if it was an action if it was like the black and white diamond pearl room where you walk in and you see the other people and you could walk up and instantly instigate a trade there it's not that would be cool and I would say would have a value to it but if it's just a menu that shows 20 names yeah sure there's nothing in here showing that you're walking around a room no like it is just literally 20 people in a room and then you randomize so I think and this is where I think people are getting caught up on the features and the money because like you alone you would never use wonder hey because you don't like that controlled you use GCS in a very specific so he's like wonder trading tape pocus I mean I do I wonder trade all the time yeah but I empty out those boxes out the boxes you're getting garbage before garbage back it's how I'm getting a ton of foreign Pokemon firm Masuda method like there are digit rate but like if you like for people for you the two main things are getting out of trade is sometimes UTS and easy French right on your mobile I think people are valid looking at that saying is that worth six dollars okay so they did say the judge right but the judge can be done in any game which used to be for free so they're minions there yet there is a there is also people don't look at oh I'm paying for convenience they're looking at I have to pay for something that I was getting for free elsewhere so there's two sides of that you see it as hey I have it conveniently here other people say hey I get it free here here and here why do I have to pay for it here there's things we don't know about Bank our sorry home we don't know if it auto sorts right if it doesn't auto start I am I don't know what I'm going to the Pokemon bank it never artist auto so let's go Pikachu let's go Eevee Auto sorted Pokemon go Auto sorts so they didn't show Auto sword it's not in there for like plans can auto cert if it auto sorts that's worth it to me that's worth some money to me again i I did sort my 400 Pokemon show did I over for days and it took me four days to it took me two hours every day for four days i watch a lot of wrestling that weekend and the reason I never sorted in Pokemon bank is because I was like that's gonna come one day it never came so if it's sorts I think that's such a dumb feature but I think that's worth yeah if it lets you mass release again there are probably people that would pay for mass releasing the thing that really drove me crazy about Pokemon bank and I don't know this for sure but it seems very likely and they didn't talk about it is in Pokemon bank you cannot change the markings and I use the markings to search so for example I will mark all my shinies as stars okay we I'm the the marking thing people need to use it better look you can you can use markings however you want but if you're using markings for IVs you're a boomer you're stuck in your old ways and you need to get out of that that is a valid way to mark no it's not because we had the judge you don't need to mark anymore you have the judge function you just how do I remember which if my Joel tix is the one that had the good IVs then you mark and then you use one shape to mark that that has good IVs you don't need to mark every single shape in order in order to know that it's marking so I like I like classifying and categorizing my pokum and I'm helping you do that better no you are yes yes okay yes not better my way is significantly better okay here we go is it bad I'm gonna break it down for you so if you use markings so we're talking about the circle triangle square heart star diamond those are the six markings there's actually 12 markers shoes because you can change it from blue to red the old way of doing things is they would mark circle for HP or whatever triangle for attack square for defense but that is such a useless thing ever since Sun and Moon because you can press the star you could you could just go to your box that why it wasn't why on the 3ds and then you could see best best best very good best best best provided you unlock that yes yes and then in sword and shield you just press the plus button twice or whatever provided you unlock that and in Pokemon home if you're paying the money if you go behind the paywall you press the plus button twice and then let's go Pikachu let's go Eevee again if you press the Y button you see the best best best best best let's say you have three thousand Pokemon where are your Chinese you have no clue where they are they could all be like I have a box called Chinese right in that box let's say you move a shiny out for a competition where is it now is it is it in the battle box is it in your PC is it in your Pokemon Bank where is it if you mark your Chinese using the star then you can just go into the search feature say I want to search by star specifically instead of finding your Pokemon with a highs special defense which is normally what people would mark star you can instantly see where all your shinies are at all times as soon as you catch a shiny market a star now for all those people that are like what if I what if this has perfect Ivy's mark it as a diamond now all you have to do is go into your bank search for diamond oh look here are all my perfect Ivy Diamond Pokemon throughout all my boxes I can quickly now organize them hey did I take the time to Eevee train this Pokemon how would I search for that I have eight perfect diamond or in this case everyone marks everything as everything I which one of these con kaldur's did I actually Evie trained well mark him as a heart hey which which one of these Pokemon came from events I got eight what is this is this shiny Gyarados the one I caught in heartgold SoulSilver is this where's the shiny Gyarados that I caught in a in a cherish ball Markham has a circle she my problem with the whole shiny thing is why can't they just do it like pokemon go where the search for shiny yeah well and it brings me my Chinese look once they do that then then that'll make it easier but like you are if you're if you're just using all the markings just for I one it's a waste because there's a way to look at your IVs very quickly now and to you like there are so many other instances instances to search for your Pokemon there's so many other is is that you search for your poco but like don't you want to search for your specific event Pokemon or like no you could mark no I use I use a triangle to mark that this Pokemon is foreign hey I have I have forty scrag ease which one was that Japanese Greggy so I can Masuda oh I could just search by triangle and now I can find all nah I'm gonna talk right there I might forget about are there in my box that says foreign okay so you can name boxes certain things but that doesn't mean that Pokemon doesn't ever leave that box and go somewhere else to do something it stays in there what am I gonna use it for get out to either breed it or Eevee train it or come use it for competitive and then I'm gonna put it back in its box okay look no one does this we're all lazy I'll forget you don't do it you don't do it separately were sitting here saying that we have to take all the extra step to come up with the key for each of your marking that I can break our system so and then you're like it's so much easier if I search by however I set my key up because I whatever you want I won't set them back in the box that I created for them for the two seconds it takes me to do that right in the moment I think they should just remove markings altogether I think that that second underused and underappreciated and kind of valueless no it is it is underused because everyone's using it for IVs which is the negative when you can just name boxes wrong wait what are you naming your boxes at this point shiny pokemon battle teams cute polka Morgan what if you have a shiny pokemon that is battle ready which box do you put it in will which box do you no no no no no I take that one and I breed it until it has a battle ready youth and then I use the youth one for battles and put that one back in the shiny box Mike Chinese are far too precious to throw out into battle so carelessly I'm trying to help people out Greg yes stomping on my markings you you can offer up your method of how you mark and say this is how I do it feel free to join me or not feel free to join okay but in Pokemon bank you couldn't edit markings and it frames like in Pokemon home you can do that what based on the screen trip all right all of a sudden it's very $15.00 where are you seeing that which screenshots telling you that also for those that want to know hi mark Giganta max Pokemon I mark my circle I'm art I used the circle mark event Pokemon just making an infographic Abid my wand I was the red circle thing already we have covered everything I think okay so if you go to screenshot 30 JPEG you can see the name the gender the level the type the fact that it's in Pokemon home and then the language is Japan and then you see the sword and shield symbol and the next to that you see all the markings and they're hovering over a Pikachu yeah and they know ugochi chapter 31 you can see the markings again it's true it doesn't mean you can change them if you can't change them I want my sixteen dollars back all right see value-add 30 home points equals one battle point wow that's a bad exchange what we don't know how much how many home points you get you get one home point a month I'm excited for home ok I will state I am excited for home I do I again much like the DLC I think we're really we're really pushing the pricing and I'm really hoping that it's worth it and that it stays going forward as a worth it prospect I'm really hoping that it they don't do what a million other companies do which is knock it out of the park the first time and get everybody used to the price and then slowly stop delivering but keeping it at the same price which happens way too often I'm excited with the reservations and not just leave it at that sir eventually adding Pokemon go support so maybe they will 2025 something else that I don't know uh yeah I'm I'm I'm excited now but if it's if this is going to come into a Pokemon make situation where they don't they they're like here you go we'll see you guys in seven years when we come up with the next thing Pokemon hotel yeah let's take a let's take our last break here and then we have Pokemon go and question and Pokemon of the week we'll be right back [Music] February events to make your heart flutter will I have no heart so now what are you gonna do trainers will be still your heart this is how it opens look where I used to have a heart is now an empty void so stillness is yes the de facto state it's a lot happening in February there's seven things here I'm gonna try to break it down as quickly as possible number one is if you decide to do the Team Rocket special research and you get to Giovanni this month it is shadow Reiko which will leave at the end of February you could probably safely assume it's going to be sweet tune orente the following and then the month after will be the other one so if you care about that I don't know our people I'm sure somebody out there is doing Giovanni every single month I haven't done - Yvonne yet I'm only funny at all - Giovanni I've done the three that have to do six more and then I can do Giovanni I guess I'll try four right I like Rocco he's alright it's a good dog it's a good tiger yeah the tiger dog tiger like creature what they say dog like Pokemon exactly February search breakthrough Lapras is done they did Lapras all through January this month it will be woo bat and you will get bonus woo bat candy my assumption is because whoa bat has the heart knows that's why they did will bat I would agree with you but smoo bat also has a heart now yes yeah yeah he Tran will be leaving the bachelor party is over bachelor party's been over a long time tornadoes the cyclone Pokemon will be in five star raids the Pokemon go community has already dubbed this as Dex filler which is the opposite of how tornadoes was received in both the TCG and in VGC competitive horn a tassel is very very good in the trading card game tornado is the only mono flying-type pokémon as far as I recall most they've added one rickety rackety Oh comes into play here these no tornados friend tornadoes could do the dog is terminated TCG it was it was a donk it was a card that could do the donk do we think tornado says in her in Pokemon go like it's rude everything else no no I think it's slanderous oh maybe Landorus for fighting but no it doesn't seem like tornadoes is specifically good for Pokemon go tornadoes really benefited from prankster the pranks durability in BGC so that'll be around for a month it starts on Tuesday February 4th it will actually end February 25th two days before Pokemon days so there's probably there's probably a reason for that I'm assuming there will be a sinnoh region celebration event which obviously means that remakes important for confirmed yes you heard it here from us first there's an insert sarcasm if you did not detect that February 7th through February 10th Pokemon originally discovered in the sinnoh region will appear more often in the wild and raids all the 7k eggs will feature Pokemon from this inner region including there's a there's not a lot of winners in here but do Combee bronze or gibble riolu hippo pitous and man tyke I can get a shiny buddy you could you could maybe finally get a gibble I heard them rubbing everybody shiny Brazilian my face I heard the real game doesn't begin until you get a gibble it used to be until you got level 40 but now you're not a true Pokemon girl player unless you have gibble or maybe it's axe you now it's actually now I think Gibble's still pretty hard to find though event-specific field research will award you with Encounters of Pokemon that were originally discovered in the recent region as well see no stones and last but not least if you're lucky you may encounter a shiny riolu or a shiny hippo put toss what about a shiny buddy that's already shiny okay do you have to be lucky for that already shiny and by shiny HIPAA POTUS you mean female right yes yeah or say powered on now they both have different colors I think the female is like black Pokemon go Valentine's Day 2020 love will soon be in the air Greg will it alright not not in my house I mean that well alright little times David is back from Friday February 14th at 8 a.m. from Monday the 17th to 10 p.m. pink pokémon will appearing more often in the wild did they do pink last year they did boring Audino the hearing

you might encounter them only if you're very lucky during this event regular lure modules will last six hours and you will receive twice catch candy bonuses if you're lucky trainers you may hatch a shiny happy knee or encounter a shiny Chansey in the wild you'll know it because it's an ugly green to continue infil to me the pink Pokemon festivities in celebration of Valentine's Day there will be a raid event on February 15th from 2 to 5 featuring liket ugh that's not right I think they're referring to like french kissing no sure you're they are very yuck there's no kissing on this program doing it a vCard of lick a tongue oh my gosh lick your tongue will be available in four-star rains and no the move body no the move body slam a good normal type move you can receive up to five additional raid passes as no cost and they will not be available after the event ends lucky trainers I'm sure you're getting lucky with like a tongue you'll may you may encounter a shiny like a tongue

friendship level I'll let her know new experiments Pokemon spot bonus our the Pokemon go team is always looking for new ways to improve the gameplay experience did I could tell you multiple places the start that isn't this this month we are testing out two new types of events pokemon spotlight hour will feature a surprise Pokemon Melton and we'll tell you where when we'll tell you what it is what and it will appear more frequently in the wild on Tuesday February 4th from 6 to 7 local time so what gen-5 pokemon hasn't been released that would appear more in the wild Ryu Nicolas sollozzo says net gen 4 no sausage in five out Jen 500k it could be kecleon oh it's kecleon kecleon but you'll never find it cuz you can't see it right right visible I mean it's been in the game the entire time uh yeah let's just let's just assume it's gonna be quickly on all right you'll be interesting if they release kakeland but you had to do a research task to get the scope that would allow you to see them like was in the game and then says the dates are appearing yeah mmm a lot of presence they haven't been giving me gifts actually not okay it's not like you have to pay for the Silph scope and then it only activates for 30 minutes hey well that's what I want mystery bonus hour you guessed it a bonus mystery a mystery bonus this unknown bonus will be live in the app Thursday February 6 from 6 to 7 and that's not all will do this month please sure to follow us for more updates they haven't talked about what's happening for Pokemon Day yeah I was gonna say did we find out who won the voting participated in inadvertently without realizing it I voted once and it was for dratini cuz it was the only stop I picked up and I needed to do my daily my family that's how they get you this is gonna be Mewtwo right I tweeted a bonus a mystery bonuses gonna be mutant raids right why we already did Meucci than right why cuz it's on February 6 that's the day Mewtwo is born maybe it's Moo I maybe I guess I guess they could do that you're right it will probably be me too which is boring but I'm hoping it's not oh why didn't wear interesting what if instead of kecleon they give us duck 'let duck let's way cooler than kecleon very true yeah or analytic but or Deerling have a maybe it's maybe it's winter Deerling we're gonna finally get all the seasonal dearly when does spring start the spring starts soon doesn't it or does not hurt to March 21st 21st yes maybe a google Deerling like we only have very we have very limited winter time left yeah but duck lets cooler than Deerling no well that's debatable Solana dice wanna know Garbo it could mmm main food poniard trying to think of what's not really steer lar Vesta lar Vesta our best let's go with mange and have all of our home an hour's not an hour's not enough time to get 400 larva Stu candy well then you gotta walk with it or use up your debuff prayer candies there you go there's all the pokemon go February news literally events after events I guess that's good though I guess I have to do that honestly cuz like well you gotta keep the money train going yep but also it's like the MMO thing of you got to keep giving them content otherwise they're gonna find a different game to go to can't slow down otherwise they'll know there's other mmo's out there and there are not a lot that are good but there are a bunch of them out there like well I mean we all know when world warcraft players get bored they start experimenting with us that's true and like something what happened to you Greg oh no wow wow it made me actively angry Oh Thailand go ah we don't have to spend a lot of time on this but go battle league it came rolling out you have to walk to do it that that's been Heatley Heatley today that debated Healey it's been he trained you debated the he trains were a very upset you can unlock pichu libre avatar items by participating you know I'm gonna be honest with you I did my free five matches and I actually had a pretty okay time with it I think mostly because I didn't really know what it is whoa okay so sure so they moved the battle tab so in and if you want to battle like Ken D'Elia or stuff can Delia spark sure sure they they took that out of the nearby which was a weird place for it anyways yeah it was a weird place when somebody hit the pokeball there's not a battle tab and then in there it keeps track of how many wins you have how many battles you've done your streak Stardust earned and you can go up a ladder and the season will reset I think this season here resets March 31st and so right now it's this season as great league and they are already set for for the next season it will be ultra league um so it does let you use different Pokemon um so you can still battle nearby with your friends and stuff you can still send to your friends invites if you want to battle them but this is like ranked battles so ideally you're gonna be playing somebody with in the same rank as you and you can win different know you can win start us and rare candy and stuff more once you make it - I think so I'm in level two right now I think you just have to play five matches to get to level two you can you can unlock a scraggy which some people were also upset about because that would require you to win hmm even you get an award for actually winning something yeah I can't remember any else wouldn't understand that yeah I think I don't know if it matters how many times you lose though so there's like premium out rewards and there's basic rewards I don't know what the difference between those are I'm I am a level two I've dealt only done five matches I just unlocked the because you had to walk five kilometres to unlock it otherwise you had to pay I think 200 coins and I was like that's fine I'm like I like it but I don't like it enough to pay two bucks but they believe they've lowered it as of this recording - you only have to walk 3k instead of 5k which i think is better I was actually talking to Bobby prior to this I think the only reason it was so high at 5k is because that was a way for them to manually throttle their server mode so they could one slowly let like level 37 players level 30 players level 20 players in slowly but also because people can connect with other people consistently if they blocked it behind 5k they could slow that down to make sure that the servers were good and now that I'm sure their servers can handle it they lowered it from five to three I don't know if it'll go any lower but also I think the walking thing is fine I mean the whole literally the whole point of Pokemon go is to walk until I get out in place I think I think III don't know what the average of like walking is like when I did have a nine-to-five job I'd be hitting at least 2k every day just walking from my office to the bathroom or to the break room or to my car to my desk and I had to go up flights of stairs it's a lot harder for me working at home but I don't think 3k is unreasonable to do you're five I mean you could just keep it and pay I guess no I don't think that's unreasonable at all I think five jaywalking game yeah I think 5k was a little much I've can only but three miles that's nothing okay final bit of news here I almost forgot this is off pokemon.com actually here now I'll just pull the press release that's actually a little bit more concise so this is just the press release also on Pokemon comm though the legendary Pokemon Rayquaza and its trainer zinnia is that he said yeah yeah I don't know how to say her name is zinnia are now available to battle and has been added to a sync pair of Pokemon masters the real-time battling and strategy game can be downloaded the in-game event is called the dragon that rules the sky it's available now until February 13th and currently players who log in each day during the in-game event will be able to earn up to 4200 gems for free which is according to this press release 14 tries to add more sync pairs to your team DNA has also announced and the following content update Lethe and Evie come to passio Cucuy I'm like in rock are now available and the game has celebrated 20 million downloads worldwide and if you log in now until March 15th you will get fifteen hundred three gems which is I think five poles the zinnia event is very similar to the Giovanni and Mewtwo event and the your character and so Gallio event which is you don't pull her you do the event and then when you complete the event and you get her and rake rick ways ax and then you continue to do the event to power them up yep it's a lot it's yeah it's a weird pair too yeah I wasn't completely satisfied with Lance I put a lot into Lance and I just don't see myself you I'm sure there's a situation where Lance is good I definitely find multiple situations that you Cynthia yes it is great which I'm happy with but I guess I haven't done this event yet I'll probably do it this week I guess like the sink pair like does a lot of damage to themselves well so the biggest problem is that all of its moves have pretty major drawbacks the other one that doesn't which is aerial ace but the other two are outraged and break oh meteor outrage will confuse you in Draco meteor will lower your stats which they have stellar imagination which will remove that but the problem is there's no way to increase zinnias speed so a lot of times where you would use them in coop you're just waiting because you have to use the bed move first then wait use the cellar imagination to help compensate for it and then try again so it what if you've really V yeah I mean and then the Eevee it doesn t v-- like here over the sink move which takes nine turns to get to huh I haven't I hadn't pulled the Eevee yet I'm saving my gems for something else so I don't know that something else is I'd yeah I'm just not a huge like I know what people love leaf I'm just doesn't do it for me so and the thing about stellar imagination is that remove confusion flinching and trapped conditions and then it's sharper sharply raises attack and special attack but it's sharply lowers defense and special defense so it's really it's really hard to use well it when it can hit it it does do a lot of damage is just there are many other ones out there that are better at doing all of those things than this one so right now I'm just I'm just using all the stuff I get out of the event to raise it to wherever I want it and then it will probably sit in the dust unless there's some major changes like a better support Pokemon that will help it speed faster like it it's just not feeling a great roll right now that Flannery is real good now apparently hey that's what I read I read the movie we're very happy with the sync rate for Flannery but I have I am NOT I mean so i don't even think i have enough Flannery to power her the problem is is right it's good right now but when everybody gets a sync grid Flannery will probably fall back to the tier 3 that Flannery always has been in like it's hard to say hey do all of your sync Ritz now when we know everything else is getting a sink rate and we don't know if that sync renewing that you're investing right now once everything has it will Flannery still be oh I see what you're saying or will it just be back to the middle of the pack because now everybody can be powered up in much better ways so I feel like Flannery wasn't great and I'm getting a boost right now but I could also use those same things for things that are already great now to make them greater like it I I'm having a hard time investing in Flannery knowing that it was terrible before it's good now but how long is that gonna last hey I don't care how good or bad that Liza is she's on my team I like well please I like the zinger it's striking there that's my team on masters input for the week III actually don't know but I would assume that they will also probably have a Pokemon Day event probably my guess probably so again if you're interested in masters you get the you get the 300 gems every day right now until what did I say the 15 16th so you might as well log in and get your gems and then you get the 1,500 gems because of their 20 million download celebration and I'm guessing I am I am definitely guessing that there will be I did that 14 day period why does this press release not say it I'm guessing there will be a Pokemon Day event yeah or this I mean just so you know Zeb strike it is second-tier hey not bad out there so it's it's the second tier to what res reddit evaluating this err no it's just sort of I usually go to the game press site Oh game analytics so like Olivia like in Rutgers Tier one and so unless a Zeb strike is - you're - hey that bad is it's a physical attacker I mean it's a SOT it's definitely a solid choice it's better than Salt Rock hey no Martin no Solrock I'm not interested in it well it's all rocks already in the game hey they can they can they can add another one alright let's question of the week here Greg alright ready I followed wills request okay boy all right which Care Bear is beware and which Pokemon are the cousins these thoughts will plague me till I die what's the question of the week I cry excellent well done congratulations for you yes for you we have a lot of good questions this week yeah we do there are a lot of good I might screenshot this and save save some of these questions for the future I think the one will go with though is Robert's question from our slack community what could Game Freak do to make you all want to make you all stop playing a main series game card $16 something called Pokemon sword and shield and make it real boring so I was thinking about this and if the games just turned into something similar to pokémon battle revolution where it's just battling then I would probably be out hmm if they turned into games like call us to kill if dark new cloud would be out I need more puzzles I just want more puzzles please puzzles puzzles like the gym buzzes that and like move the blocks around to get to the legendary Pokemon and that kind of stuff or like figure out which path to go in the underground world mm-hmm so I was I was thinking about this too of I played so much destiny destiny has puzzles yeah sure I played a lot of destiny and when they announced that oh you know all those guns and all those emblems and all the ships and all the shaders some those emblems and shaders cost real money or somewhere exclusive to these events that you went to or you didn't go to and you've decided to buy them on eBay those were not coming forward to a second game I was so mad and bummed at that and they were like well here's what we're gonna do instead of you bringing all 120 shaders that you collected over the three years in Destiny one we're gonna give you this one shader to say that like shader by the way a shader is just like it changed your armor color so you could collect different armor but you could then put a shader on it and then it would look relatively pleasant together right yes they were like instead of you collected all this stuff and you did all this things to get all this stuff but we're gonna give you back this one emblem to show that you did all this work and I was like it's not really good enough but that's fire I love I love destiny a lot I'm super I didn't even I was so mad about this of like because they sell they sold destiny as like a ten year game of like everything is gonna come with you on this journey and then at some point obviously they decided to like you know what we're starting over we're gonna give what year will destiny one players some recognition and then we're gonna do it all again in destiny - and while destiny - was like very similar in a lot of aspects they changed enough where it just wasn't fun to me anymore so they like they changed some of the abilities of the classes I played they like changed the Super's and The Ultimates they changed how which guns you held and it just they changed a little bit of everything enough to be like I like this but also I don't and I don't know what that would be specifically in Pokemon because every change they've made so far are changes that I've actually really liked like for example there's not a lot of trainers that you need to battle to get to the end of that game in sword and shield maybe that's why well doesn't like it may it do you because the the routes aren't littered with like 200 trainers with four Magikarp each that you just plow through that artifice to give you the illusion of like slowing you down yes I love those changes but I think for some people they they like the experience share always being on people hate that because it because it takes away the like oh I have to sit in the grass and I have to kill lit bug a million times in order to get ready for the next gym but I love that I don't have to do that so really every every change they've made has been pretty good for me where I could now I can relate to the people that want I mean I think those people are maybe hey whatever if you enjoy killing wild Pokemon and that makes the game more fun to you over and over again I get it but I also don't get it but I can see how those little changes eventually add up to push somebody away from a game if they got rid of cooking like if it was just main series rental codes go and do competitive you would still play that no I wouldn't play that no I mean I would play it but I wouldn't play it every day like I've been playing most Pokemon games nowadays I'm to the point where I don't want to Masuda anymore I'm to the point where breeding is like not great but I can ignore that part I just it's just it's the same and that's I'm sure people love that but like mana it's literally the same since Gen 4 and it's it's very tiresome I mean it's not the same but what do you mean it's not the same I mean you put two in yeah give whatever stone you give one the Destiny night you spend in a circle Steve do you know how braiding works in real life you put two people together look I read the Pokemon go press release I know you bodyslam you get the lake a tongue I understand I mean it is definitely a thing to do while I'm doing other things right they like you're right they change two egg moves they change egg moves they changed it so that you can put like if you have one that you like and just delete the move you all transfer over and you're good like there are massive changes shining shiny hunting breeding has never changed ever will be it is literally something I do while watching the finale did a good place which is what I did and I cried the entire time that's what I do when I eat my breakfast in the morning and I make little videos for a snapchat followers yep in tempt em oh here we go I'd have to I'd have to I've never actually done this in time time I was watching another streamer explain it but apparently the males stopped becoming like fertile and you have to like you can't use them for breeding after a certain amount of time and you have to like switch which is kind of interesting I don't know if that would make it more fun that actually just seems like more busy work but it is interested in more busy work I I'd have to see it in motion but also the other thing that I thought again I don't think this makes it better but instead of like a breeder crossing their arms to say an egg grows ready you can see like two eggs queue up on the shelf and you can just grab them from there which is kind of dobble I mean they're pushing will away but wills never really elaborated what specifically is the reason boring I'm kind of excited to go into Rose tower so we'll see but what sweepin up for but like what's what's boring or the fight boring i if they had literally elaborated if they just literally just made it that even for like like the FIR time you go to the wild area and you know the first half of the game you didn't see anything except for a new Pokemon I would have been fine it's the fact that I was just confronted with old Pokemon that I didn't care about because I already have 18 copies of them so early in the game it just it's I was almost like this isn't a new game I'm just playing an old game with a new overlay so that's that's what kind of took it away from me thanks why I did that though no no no no exit why started out you got all it was it was very very deep Pokemon until you got much further into the game and then also it was like with the Horde mechanics and everything that made it that much more exciting so I I definitely don't think there's a comparison there hmm that first forest had all those three garbage monkeys in it that is true I never knew monkeys there were new monkeys in Gen 5 there are not new monkeys and Gen 6 they're not garbage monkeys they're wonderful I mean also the first forest didn't I had Caterpie in it yeah it did what was it the very first thing you run into and that first thing that you have to catch this Vigi I like Dixon why yeah me too except for aerial battles please take those away and give us more reverse battles well what a fiddly expansion they have a place where you can plant trees I mean I I did you know I am still playing sword and shield I know just no not as rapidly as I would have liked okay I can tell you a couple things that I don't like about sword and shield but not enough to push me away I think pokey jobs are absolute garbage no I certainly don't waste my time with that I think they're fine I think the eve never find out start I think the only training part of it is great that's not what I'm complaining about I think putting like hey I'm not gonna be playing the game on Sunday because I'm recording a podcast or hey I'm not going to be able to play the game on Thursday because I'm going out to dinner so like pre-planning and putting Pokemon into that to like get them Eevee bribed and came come back the next day I think is great I think that's awesome but like just putting 30 ghost-type pokémon on a mission for them to come back with one nugget is like not worth the trouble of those 30 ghost-type pokémon being puked into your first box or if your first box is like partially full puked into your first and second box or if your second box is partially full puked into your first second and third box it's just not worth like finding those Pokemon and then sending them out for just what comes back is a lousy reward I think pala go was just this well way better like side thing that you could do so that's like one complaint I have is pokey jobs is not a good not a good Pella go substitute and I think that I think that like the game does need a Pella go substitute and what was it an x and y and x and y they like kind of appeared on the bottom screen and kind of danced around and stuff i was like one of the minigames yeah I think the shaking is shaking the trees for berries is awful and again I think Pella Go is better I think Sun and I think x and y was better for getting berries but just like it's just a thing I do you is like alright we're gonna go to every tree we're gonna shake it and sometimes ask wove it comes out and sometimes not but like that act of going to each tree shaking like that little minigame is not fun I mean you get berries at the end of raids but I I don't feeI I think those two things are huge let downs for me but again not enough to push me away from the game because the max raids make up for it which I guess going into future games like I like the max raids so much and I get the best the gimmick of this game but like the co-op feature of doing max raids with three other people and having the chance of hidden ability and getting really good rewards if they take that away from a Pokemon in a future Pokemon game which they probably will boy they have to they better have a good substitute they took away pal ago and they like gave us pokey jobs and that's not good enough no but they didn't take away anything to give us max raids so I can see a future Pokemon game if they if they don't have a good substitute for max raids yeah they took away man teen surf thank you well I would say that the Rotom bike thing is a good substitute I don't know if it's a better substitute but I have and Rotom rally yet now I I do like Rotom rally it's okay I think it's as okay as man teen sir I think man teen serve gave you better rewards oh I agree with that I think it did too but I think Rotom rally is a little bit quicker and a little bit more fun than mantastic also like the changes to the power items and this item may be better so like doing the jobs just isn't as useful like if you can get the power items it's I mean is so much faster than saying go away for 24 hours yeah I mean I timed it it took max out 1 Evie with a power item and poked your wrist and I knocked out what Palpa tote 4 HP I think it took 15 minutes yeah I mean nother thing add +8 instead of plus 4 yeah it's huge but again I mean if you can send if for some reason your life is organized and you're like I'm sending these 30 Pokemon out for HP training for 24 hours because I'm not playing a game that's awesome that's definitely a time save but I have done they're happy but you have to know which Pokemon you're sending out for which Eevee training and what day you're not going to be playing but it does work and you need them all to have the item really or poker s and a thing that doubles it because the 24 hours doesn't get you to max yeah I think pokey wrists and 24 hours gets you to max though right I think he gets to 196 and not mad I'd have to look it up again but I think it since it only doubles it and I think it's only doesn't max if like I think it only did like alone it does 96 and 24 hours and I think it the buggers doubles it I'd have to look again it is not it's not ideal will poke him out of the week oh boy I forgot to bring up last week's Pokemon of the week who was it Greg [Music] [Applause] big Lee but it was a Glee buff um yeah it was it was it was like the song it was a Nick Burgess song yeah and posted it in I posted in the slack the Pokemon of the week slack but the fact that I kept talking about babies meant it was a baby Pokemon there's only so many baby Pokemon out there it evolves when you get high friendship it has competitive cute charm and friend guard as abilities if you didn't pick that up from the song and also the very from my point of view clear some babies want to fill with air and sing out very bad since inglese off is a balloon didn't say like Smoochum is not well that would that would help also the level one moves for a niggly buff our defense curl pound sweet kiss and copycat the shuffle icon is amazing why it's so cute yeah happy to face and his big eye pretty good there's not a lot of good trivia about a Glee buff the one that stands out here is a Glee buff and it's of all forms to share the same category with qwilfish and drifloon they're all known as the balloon Pokemon balloon Pokemon it is the UN 20 year of the drifloon no it's the year the qwilfish no see you have the drifloon drifloon if Lou didn't sign up in time it was like she was like the PAX panel they had to sign up before December 31st and they missed it and then they didn't get the panel instead qwilfish got the dates wrong and it's air fare and did not arrive so soon did you notice how the sprite animation in black and white and black and white to freak LaBeouf is just amazingly fantastic it's like floating around yeah it's cute all right what's our new plug why the leak oh I don't know if you guys can handle this I can't but I'm gonna try here we go the podcast dewy dudes is dedicated to promoting and reviewing skincare products and techniques for men an area high neglect for many my daily facial skin care routine includes beard and face wash beard softener not hair conditioner facial moisturizer always in a pump bottle and neck never regular skin moisturizer eye cream dab or roll-on never smear and beard oil or cream it is essential to apply moisturizers as soon as possible after washing your face you want to create a protective bubble especially around your face to lock in the moisture and keep your skin looking young and fresh you must use a dedicated facial moisturizer so that it will absorb more readily the question of whether to use a facial moisturizer with an SPF continues to be highly debated on one hand the protection can have the damage of exposure to the fiery Sun and even make it impossible for you to get a burn preventing this damage can virtually double moisturizing effectiveness as the underlying soft head remains undamaged on the other hand SPF and facial moisturizer tends to give an unnatural shininess to the skin I am NOT saying you will turn purple with red eyes but it is still not a good look lately I have also been looking into the potential for advanced anti wrinkling techniques even the most dedicated skincare enthusiasts will develop a line or two over the course of time while Botox has been the go-to for many years the venom of the spider hetero hetero poda David Bowie has been shown to have a similar effect without requiring injections we are still unsure of how long the effect lasts though my last bit of advice is to start a skincare routine as early in life as possible you cannot preserve what has already been lost at the very least you should start before you are 22 after that you may require a more evolved routine all right there you go that's your Pokemon of the week oh boy if you want to join us over on our subreddit our slash super-effective or almost up to 1200 people and I will be making a new graphic this week for all the codes that are available for the month of February that you can download and sort and shield I know there are some new ones that just came out over the last couple days and there are some that people probably forgot about that came out earlier in January that are still available so keep your eyes peeled for that on social media twitch offered me a pass to PAX East so I will be at PAX East no panel this year as well and Greg will not be there and I can't do a panel by myself what do you mean I did a panel well with Brittany yeah you see you had another person I'm sure if you asked Brittany to come up for PAX East she would come I'm sure but the PAX is like really weird this year because it's at the end of February and it's usually at like yup mid to end of March and so I normally apply for panels at the beginning of January because they usually ask for people to submit by January 31st and then they usually pick like two weeks beforehand but since they moved it up the panel's got moved up and I got closed out of it so if that's fine no big deal I still got a pass I will still be there I will be there specifically on Friday and Saturday I will actually be flying back Sunday morning to then record the podcast when I get back so we don't miss that Monday and I will be flying out on Thursday night so on Pokemon Day we should still have a twitch stream at twitch.tv slash pkmn cast during Pokemon Day I'm sure all the news will be announced the night of the 26 since Japan is in the future but I'm sure they'll save some news also the Pokemon movie the Miche movie comes out on this one seventh so that's a thing but yeah that's that's pretty much the the game plan for the month lots of Pokemon go stuff mill Surrey rotates out in two weeks and we'll probably get another Pokemon Lapras flap oh and colossal I think rotate out at the end of this week maybe maybe it's that's fine I already got
