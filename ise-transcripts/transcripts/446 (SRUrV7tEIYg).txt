[Music] (0:01 - 0:28)
what's up everyone welcome to the (0:25 - 0:32)
446 episode of the pokemon podcast i see (0:28 - 0:33)
i thought i got the episode (0:32 - 0:35)
wrong when you were laughing before but (0:33 - 0:36)
we're good no (0:35 - 0:40)
i'm your host sbj (0:36 - 0:42)
here we got some pokemon news we got (0:40 - 0:43)
greg here (0:42 - 0:46)
hello i am knee deep in making yet (0:43 - 0:48)
another pokemon rpg (0:46 - 0:51)
a dnd rpg not like a no not like a video (0:48 - 0:51)
game (0:51 - 0:53)
and it's not d it's a it's a different (0:51 - 0:55)
system oh okay okay (0:53 - 0:58)
will also here i really want a hamburger (0:55 - 0:59)
how do you feel about the meat (0:58 - 1:02)
to bun ratio oh my god no (0:59 - 1:04)
not an issue for me for me the issue is (1:02 - 1:06)
the meat to cheese ratio (1:04 - 1:10)
ratio yeah wait i also enjoy (1:06 - 1:13)
all sorts of vegetables on my burger or (1:10 - 1:16)
if it's a if it's a blue see in my (1:13 - 1:17)
burger (1:16 - 1:19)
is it too much cheese or too little (1:17 - 1:20)
cheese (1:19 - 1:22)
it really comes down to if you can't (1:20 - 1:24)
taste the cheese (1:22 - 1:27)
they have failed okay i agree i agree (1:24 - 1:29)
100 on board here because sometimes that (1:27 - 1:30)
happens (1:29 - 1:32)
sometimes it's just like one little (1:30 - 1:33)
slice of yellow on top of my burg (1:32 - 1:35)
and i ain't taste no cheese unless i (1:33 - 1:37)
like pull the top (1:35 - 1:41)
bun off and like lick the bun (1:37 - 1:41)
you know meet the fda requirement of (1:43 - 1:47)
enough dairy product to call this a (1:45 - 1:50)
cheese burger no i i need (1:47 - 1:52)
to taste more cheese than meat i think (1:50 - 1:54)
honestly (1:52 - 1:57)
really i need i need (1:54 - 2:00)
i need generally just uh the hint of (1:57 - 2:03)
cheese i like my bacon i like my hint of (2:00 - 2:04)
cheese (2:03 - 2:07)
i like my big thick patty i do like (2:04 - 2:09)
i do like having a real amount of meat (2:07 - 2:11)
right i want my burger to be (2:09 - 2:13)
like that that's the problem with our (2:11 - 2:14)
fast food chains in this country is that (2:13 - 2:15)
the meat is (2:14 - 2:19)
slim where's the beef exactly um (2:15 - 2:21)
but the other issue right and it goes (2:19 - 2:22)
beyond (2:21 - 2:25)
just the burg right am i getting tater (2:22 - 2:26)
tots or am i getting fries (2:25 - 2:29)
with my burger because i'd rather have (2:26 - 2:30)
some seasoned tater tots (2:29 - 2:32)
i mean tater tots are a big thing up (2:30 - 2:34)
here like that's (2:32 - 2:37)
often i greatly appreciate it they are (2:34 - 2:38)
often however (2:37 - 2:40)
not treated with the same care that (2:38 - 2:42)
fries are (2:40 - 2:44)
that in what sense insufficiently fried (2:42 - 2:46)
well usually way over fried (2:44 - 2:49)
because they forget about them and two (2:46 - 2:50)
usually (2:49 - 2:52)
under salted because they think all the (2:50 - 2:54)
salt is in the mixture that the pack i'm (2:52 - 2:57)
like now you gotta stop the outside too (2:54 - 3:00)
i go for a season tot oh so (2:57 - 3:03)
the salt issue is not that big because (3:00 - 3:05)
the seasoning kind of compensates for (3:03 - 3:08)
any lack of salting (3:05 - 3:10)
what's your favorite seasoning on a tot (3:08 - 3:11)
you know i like that lowry's (3:10 - 3:14)
lowry's that's not a seasoning lottery (3:11 - 3:16)
seasoning salt sure is (3:14 - 3:19)
never heard of that before what (3:16 - 3:21)
my seasonings usually go in the same (3:19 - 3:23)
form as like the seasonings you'd find (3:21 - 3:23)
on (3:23 - 3:26)
a what is that chicken buffalo chicken (3:23 - 3:27)
chicken wings oh yeah yeah (3:26 - 3:30)
i forget the place was it red stag that (3:27 - 3:33)
did truffle tater tots (3:30 - 3:35)
i'm in i'm in speaking of fries (3:33 - 3:36)
mcdonald's (3:35 - 3:40)
yes he knows how steve avoided his (3:36 - 3:43)
entire controversy about not liking (3:40 - 3:45)
bacon on a burger and (3:43 - 3:49)
his controversial burger to bun (3:45 - 3:50)
i just we don't need to get back into (3:49 - 3:53)
the bun talk because there's only one (3:50 - 3:53)
person (3:53 - 3:56)
who i i could believe i could eat a (3:53 - 3:58)
hamburger on (3:56 - 3:59)
two pieces of lettuce which we know is (3:58 - 4:01)
like yeah like (3:59 - 4:03)
garlic is two vampires a hamburger in (4:01 - 4:04)
lettuce is (4:03 - 4:07)
to a steve how dare (4:04 - 4:10)
you ruin my perfect transition in into a (4:07 - 4:12)
conversation about fries (4:10 - 4:14)
to a conversation about pokemon toys at (4:12 - 4:15)
mcdonald's (4:14 - 4:17)
it was perfect pokemon toys at (4:15 - 4:19)
mcdonald's i i have it it's our first (4:17 - 4:20)
news article (4:19 - 4:22)
i have to walk a whole block to get to a (4:20 - 4:23)
mcdonald's while there's a burger king (4:22 - 4:24)
right outside my window (4:23 - 4:27)
well you know burger king they they (4:24 - 4:29)
peaked with the uh six gold (4:27 - 4:33)
gems that they had the old polyworld (4:29 - 4:34)
mewtwo charizard (4:33 - 4:38)
jigglypuff pikachu what's their last one (4:34 - 4:40)
publisher sure ebay will let you know (4:38 - 4:43)
this is off nintendo life (4:40 - 4:45)
because of the 25th anniversary it looks (4:43 - 4:48)
like mcdonald's will well they did say (4:45 - 4:49)
in the original press release that they (4:48 - 4:51)
will be partnering with mcdonald's (4:49 - 4:53)
but it's supposed to start next month (4:51 - 4:55)
there is a picture of (4:53 - 4:57)
what the display is supposed to look (4:55 - 4:59)
like and (4:57 - 5:02)
it's just like generic pikachu (4:59 - 5:05)
generic starters doesn't look anything (5:02 - 5:09)
too fancy but there will be cards (5:05 - 5:11)
given out as well which is usually (5:09 - 5:12)
common (5:11 - 5:14)
i think almost always that mcdonald's (5:12 - 5:16)
and pokemon have partnered up there's (5:14 - 5:17)
always a (5:16 - 5:20)
card to go with the happy meal (5:17 - 5:22)
so you know that there's toys we don't (5:20 - 5:23)
know if there's toys we know there's (5:22 - 5:25)
most likely cards at this point (5:23 - 5:28)
but what are the toys it's i guess we (5:25 - 5:29)
don't know fully but (5:28 - 5:31)
so far the display shows what looks to (5:29 - 5:33)
be starter stickers or (5:31 - 5:35)
maybe keychains i'm not sure is that a (5:33 - 5:36)
good picture no (5:35 - 5:40)
i just take issue with this because back (5:36 - 5:41)
in 1998 (5:40 - 5:43)
for those of us that can remember that (5:41 - 5:45)
far back in time 22 years ago (5:43 - 5:48)
kfc was the original partner with the (5:45 - 5:50)
pokemon company international (5:48 - 5:52)
with their pokemon beanie babies that (5:50 - 5:54)
you could get at kfc (5:52 - 5:56)
for their 25th anniversary don't you (5:54 - 5:58)
think they could have gone back to the (5:56 - 5:59)
one that came with (5:58 - 6:03)
and gotten us back into kfc's (5:59 - 6:06)
how many k how many kfc's do you think (6:03 - 6:06)
versus (6:06 - 6:08)
mcdonald's locations are there like for (6:06 - 6:10)
everyone i see there has to be like (6:08 - 6:14)
i'm talking about honor justice and (6:10 - 6:17)
respecting the history of where you came (6:14 - 6:18)
from (6:17 - 6:20)
that's what i'm talking about plus if i (6:18 - 6:22)
had to choose between a burger and a (6:20 - 6:23)
fried chicken i'd go for i'd go for the (6:22 - 6:26)
fried chicken and a biscuit heck yeah (6:23 - 6:28)
there's your meat to bun ratio give me (6:26 - 6:30)
like (6:28 - 6:31)
three three pieces of fried chicken and (6:30 - 6:33)
four biscuits and i'm (6:31 - 6:36)
in heaven the question is it looks by (6:33 - 6:37)
the way it looks like the cards being (6:36 - 6:38)
included (6:37 - 6:41)
are the starter pokemon so all (6:38 - 6:43)
we're at 25 starter pokemon at this (6:41 - 6:44)
point i think (6:43 - 6:47)
four times or eight times three plus (6:44 - 6:48)
pikachu (6:47 - 6:50)
yeah i think that's 25. oh i guess if (6:48 - 6:52)
you do yeah (6:50 - 6:55)
this leads into uh (6:52 - 6:56)
if you're going to use that kind of math (6:55 - 6:58)
it's 26 because evie i don't think (6:56 - 7:00)
there's an evie card (6:58 - 7:03)
what what a ripoff yes but for the (7:00 - 7:05)
accuracy of our program there's 26 (7:03 - 7:06)
starter pokemon (7:05 - 7:08)
sure yes i i would agree that evie would (7:06 - 7:09)
be in the starter (7:08 - 7:12)
pokemon plethora of things (7:09 - 7:16)
since uh gary takes one in yellow (7:12 - 7:17)
well also because there's a game called (7:16 - 7:19)
let's go eevee where your start of (7:17 - 7:20)
pokemon is (7:19 - 7:22)
that was the obvious one i was just (7:20 - 7:25)
giving another like two points to the (7:22 - 7:25)
point (7:25 - 7:28)
i'm like staring hard giving credit to (7:25 - 7:29)
the people who discount (7:28 - 7:32)
let's go that's what you're doing i'm (7:29 - 7:34)
staring hard at these pictures to see if (7:32 - 7:35)
there's an eevee (7:34 - 7:37)
anywhere potentially in these cards and (7:35 - 7:38)
i don't see one (7:37 - 7:41)
well it's not in the cards for this evie (7:38 - 7:42)
speaking of cards this is off (7:41 - 7:43)
pokemon.com (7:42 - 7:46)
charizard v-max phalanx v-rillaboom (7:43 - 7:49)
v-max and more in pokemon tcg shining (7:46 - 7:51)
fates (7:49 - 7:53)
in addition to providing yet another (7:51 - 7:55)
opportunity to hone battle skills and (7:53 - 7:57)
obliterate this this is off their (7:55 - 8:00)
website opposing pokemon traders (7:57 - 8:01)
pokemon trading card game will offer (8:00 - 8:03)
exciting opportunities to view pokemon (8:01 - 8:05)
in new light with each new card some (8:03 - 8:07)
cards contain powerful pokemon enough to (8:05 - 8:08)
overpower an opponent with a single (8:07 - 8:09)
attack (8:08 - 8:11)
others contain pokemon that simply make (8:09 - 8:13)
you smile or process that special (8:11 - 8:13)
ability (8:13 - 8:16)
when used efficiently and can subtly (8:13 - 8:18)
subtly influence the trajectory of a (8:16 - 8:19)
battle (8:18 - 8:21)
somebody really pulled out the thesaurus (8:19 - 8:23)
here (8:21 - 8:25)
pokemon tcg shining fates expansion (8:23 - 8:28)
boasts more than 190 cards (8:25 - 8:30)
featuring a range of adorable to (8:28 - 8:31)
ferocious (8:30 - 8:35)
in addition to some ferociously adorable (8:31 - 8:37)
here's a glimpse at some of the cards so (8:35 - 8:38)
we have a (8:37 - 8:41)
the shiny the shiny charizard v max card (8:38 - 8:43)
the shiny failings card the shiny real (8:41 - 8:44)
boom card (8:43 - 8:47)
shiny polti guys they're all shiny the (8:44 - 8:49)
the the set is called shining fates and (8:47 - 8:51)
then shiny did denney what does shiny (8:49 - 8:52)
mean does do you (8:51 - 8:54)
literally get the alternate color or is (8:52 - 8:55)
it like just the ram (8:54 - 8:58)
rainbow kind of holographic that is the (8:55 - 9:00)
alternate color like in the games (8:58 - 9:03)
oh that's cool yeah it was the same (9:00 - 9:04)
shining (9:03 - 9:08)
or hidden hidden hidden fates (9:04 - 9:09)
i don't know i don't pay that much (9:08 - 9:11)
attention but it's the so it's the same (9:09 - 9:12)
v-necks (9:11 - 9:15)
v v-neck charizard (9:12 - 9:17)
because that's getting back into style (9:15 - 9:19)
the same charizard v-max that's in the (9:17 - 9:20)
other set (9:19 - 9:24)
but now in different colors yes (9:20 - 9:27)
my charizard v max card psa gem (9:24 - 9:29)
mint 10 is going to lose value because (9:27 - 9:31)
it's not as good as the (9:29 - 9:33)
alternate colored one uh yes i don't (9:31 - 9:34)
think the (9:33 - 9:36)
i don't think the shiny charizard this (9:34 - 9:38)
shiny charger v max card will probably (9:36 - 9:40)
still be (9:38 - 9:43)
will will be worth money uh but i don't (9:40 - 9:45)
think it will decrease the value of the (9:43 - 9:49)
other rainbow rare charizard v-max or (9:45 - 9:52)
charizard v max or the other non-v (9:49 - 9:55)
max charizard but is a shining charizard (9:52 - 9:57)
that was in the other set (9:55 - 9:59)
there's been a lot of charizards in like (9:57 - 10:00)
the last six very true (9:59 - 10:05)
very true charizard's all the way down (10:00 - 10:05)
yes so all i want to do is walk into a (10:09 - 10:13)
target (10:12 - 10:16)
and get my cards and i can't yes i had (10:13 - 10:17)
to wait in line (10:16 - 10:21)
to buy cards at a target the other day (10:17 - 10:23)
and it was dumb well that's that's what (10:21 - 10:24)
happens when you don't support your (10:23 - 10:26)
local game store (10:24 - 10:27)
they all went out of business here in (10:26 - 10:30)
wisconsin that's not true (10:27 - 10:32)
when i was there with you in august we (10:30 - 10:34)
went to the local game store (10:32 - 10:36)
the barrister yeah yeah they had like (10:34 - 10:37)
three locations (10:36 - 10:39)
they're down to one which is the one you (10:37 - 10:41)
went to oh dang (10:39 - 10:47)
boy hard times okay so i will give (10:41 - 10:50)
the podcast the fast version of what's (10:47 - 10:51)
happening (10:50 - 10:55)
i did record the long version of what's (10:51 - 10:57)
happening which will go up on youtube (10:55 - 11:01)
uh with the card game but ultimately (10:57 - 11:03)
what happened is i think we talked about (11:01 - 11:05)
this before on the show but (11:03 - 11:09)
ultimately what happened is right before (11:05 - 11:12)
champions path came out which was also (11:09 - 11:14)
around the time it was the time between (11:12 - 11:16)
darkness ablaze (11:14 - 11:20)
and vivid voltage darkness ablaze (11:16 - 11:23)
has charizard in it vivid voltage had (11:20 - 11:25)
fat pikachu (11:23 - 11:27)
champions path was the bonus set that (11:25 - 11:28)
came out which (11:27 - 11:31)
also had more charizard in it and (11:28 - 11:33)
other cards that people wanted during (11:31 - 11:35)
that time (11:33 - 11:38)
a couple really really really big non (11:35 - 11:42)
pokemon youtubers decided to open (11:38 - 11:46)
older pokemon cards like base set fossil (11:42 - 11:49)
team rocket jungle on (11:46 - 11:51)
their youtube channel pretty pretty easy (11:49 - 11:52)
right (11:51 - 11:55)
old those older sets the the the team (11:52 - 11:56)
rockets the fossils the things that we (11:55 - 11:58)
grew up with the wizards of the coast (11:56 - 11:59)
sets (11:58 - 12:01)
they're very expensive right like a box (11:59 - 12:03)
of of those cards can be anywhere (12:01 - 12:07)
between like fifteen thousand dollars to (12:03 - 12:08)
fifty thousand dollars probably even (12:07 - 12:10)
more you spend like twenty thousand (12:08 - 12:12)
dollars on a box of (12:10 - 12:15)
fossil you get 36 packs (12:12 - 12:18)
and then you open them and then people (12:15 - 12:19)
it's like gambling (12:18 - 12:21)
except you're not spending the money but (12:19 - 12:23)
you're watching people open (12:21 - 12:25)
very very expensive packs and it's it (12:23 - 12:26)
can be exciting (12:25 - 12:27)
because these packs have been sitting (12:26 - 12:30)
for 20 years and some of the cards in (12:27 - 12:31)
the pack are worth (12:30 - 12:34)
money and so then (12:31 - 12:38)
other big non-pokemon youtubers (12:34 - 12:40)
took what was happening so there's a (12:38 - 12:42)
thing called breaks (12:40 - 12:44)
which i believe we talked about before (12:42 - 12:45)
where (12:44 - 12:49)
you sell the packs (12:45 - 12:52)
in the box you buy so for example if you (12:49 - 12:54)
spend twenty thousand dollars on a team (12:52 - 12:55)
rocket box (12:54 - 12:57)
you could say like will and i could go (12:55 - 12:59)
to greg and i said (12:57 - 13:02)
i could say greg i will give you one of (12:59 - 13:03)
these packs (13:02 - 13:07)
for seven hundred dollars what and then (13:03 - 13:09)
will i will give you a face pack that's (13:07 - 13:10)
the definition of give (13:09 - 13:12)
oh i will sell you one of these packs (13:10 - 13:14)
for 700 (13:12 - 13:16)
and then because there are 36 packs i (13:14 - 13:18)
find like 30 other people (13:16 - 13:21)
and now i've turned what is normally (13:18 - 13:22)
opening a pokemon (13:21 - 13:25)
box into an event because now people (13:22 - 13:29)
are both financially invested (13:25 - 13:31)
and there's like more entertainment (13:29 - 13:32)
value there right (13:31 - 13:36)
because like let's say i (13:32 - 13:38)
as a content creator sell those packs to (13:36 - 13:40)
other content creators (13:38 - 13:42)
not only is that content creator (13:40 - 13:44)
watching their (13:42 - 13:47)
audience is watching so if (13:44 - 13:50)
i was like oh man i love drive check (13:47 - 13:52)
i've never gotten into pokemon cards (13:50 - 13:54)
this is gonna be will's pack (13:52 - 13:55)
i know nothing about this but i hope (13:54 - 13:57)
whatever steve (13:55 - 14:00)
opens for will is really great so you (13:57 - 14:02)
can see how this snowballs (14:00 - 14:04)
and then after i uh the after the (14:02 - 14:06)
content creator opens the pack (14:04 - 14:10)
they do like a fake reaction of like oh (14:06 - 14:14)
wow you got a non-hollow persian you (14:10 - 14:14)
know (14:14 - 14:18)
it's still cool it's not like a (14:14 - 14:21)
dark shiny blastoise but uh you know (14:18 - 14:21)
persian is (14:21 - 14:24)
rat like they do this like fake thing to (14:21 - 14:25)
make you feel better that you spent (14:24 - 14:26)
seven hundred dollars and you got like a (14:25 - 14:28)
four dollar persian card (14:26 - 14:30)
but anyways after that i spent seven (14:28 - 14:32)
hundred dollars for somebody else to get (14:30 - 14:33)
all the joy of opening the pack for (14:32 - 14:34)
right (14:33 - 14:36)
correct don't understand how this has (14:34 - 14:37)
become a thing (14:36 - 14:40)
the i i think the reason that this has (14:37 - 14:41)
become a thing (14:40 - 14:44)
is because most of these people who are (14:41 - 14:46)
buying into a break okay (14:44 - 14:48)
and for the record i'm going to explain (14:46 - 14:50)
in a second why breaks are good (14:48 - 14:52)
uh this is like the bad side of breaks (14:50 - 14:54)
because you're getting ripped off (14:52 - 14:56)
but you're absolutely getting ripped off (14:54 - 14:57)
if you (14:56 - 15:00)
pick if you sold me a pack for 700 (14:57 - 15:04)
and what i got back was a buck 50 (15:00 - 15:07)
that's a rip that's a scam yes yes yeah (15:04 - 15:09)
and i i think do the math on the youtube (15:07 - 15:10)
video of like (15:09 - 15:13)
how much money they're making even if (15:10 - 15:14)
they (15:13 - 15:17)
so usually when a content creator sells (15:14 - 15:17)
a break (15:17 - 15:19)
they save like two or three packs for (15:17 - 15:21)
themselves but because they put an up (15:19 - 15:23)
charge on the packs (15:21 - 15:25)
they make like an eight thousand dollar (15:23 - 15:27)
profit (15:25 - 15:30)
off the entire thing regardless of the (15:27 - 15:31)
packs they open (15:30 - 15:32)
so they could open three packs and get (15:31 - 15:34)
the three persians and be like i lost (15:32 - 15:36)
like i got bad packs or they could open (15:34 - 15:37)
like (15:36 - 15:40)
dark charizard and be like oh not only (15:37 - 15:41)
did i make 8 000 (15:40 - 15:44)
off everyone else i just opened uh a 2 (15:41 - 15:44)
000 (15:44 - 15:47)
card that i can now sell so the the (15:44 - 15:48)
person hosting it (15:47 - 15:51)
is never in a lose-lose position and i (15:48 - 15:51)
think (15:51 - 15:54)
greg one of the big issues for you and (15:51 - 15:55)
me (15:54 - 15:56)
and you know pardoned me for speaking (15:55 - 15:58)
for you but we do have (15:56 - 16:01)
our particular age in common and just (15:58 - 16:02)
the fact (16:01 - 16:04)
that i really think that this is like a (16:02 - 16:06)
cult of personality thing (16:04 - 16:09)
where it's like uh who name somebody (16:06 - 16:10)
who's doing one of these things is it (16:09 - 16:10)
pewdiepie (16:10 - 16:13)
is that dude okay i don't wanna name any (16:10 - 16:15)
content creators the one that kind of (16:13 - 16:16)
started it all was (16:15 - 16:19)
uh i believe is logan paul oh the worst (16:16 - 16:20)
of them all (16:19 - 16:23)
okay fine but it's like there's people (16:20 - 16:25)
who get excited because (16:23 - 16:29)
that content creator is like saying (16:25 - 16:32)
their name yes right i guess maybe it's (16:29 - 16:32)
like (16:32 - 16:36)
let's let's take young william and greg (16:32 - 16:40)
to 1991 madonna is at the height of her (16:36 - 16:41)
cinematic (16:40 - 16:44)
and music you know (16:41 - 16:47)
and in the middle of what was her movie (16:44 - 16:49)
i can't remember the name of it (16:47 - 16:51)
truth or dare truth or dare in the (16:49 - 16:52)
middle of truth or dare (16:51 - 16:55)
she says i dedicate this performance to (16:52 - 16:57)
will anderson and i'm like (16:55 - 17:00)
yeah i'd pay 700 for that (16:57 - 17:03)
i wouldn't but that's that's well but (17:00 - 17:05)
okay you whatever whoever your cult of (17:03 - 17:06)
personality person was (17:05 - 17:08)
i'm just being making an example but (17:06 - 17:10)
that's what's hard because i think for (17:08 - 17:11)
me and greg we don't (17:10 - 17:14)
we don't find twitch or youtube (17:11 - 17:15)
personalities to (17:14 - 17:17)
have that level of sway over our hearts (17:15 - 17:18)
and emotions (17:17 - 17:22)
i also feel that way (17:18 - 17:24)
um i also couldn't ever be in a position (17:22 - 17:26)
where i would (17:24 - 17:28)
i couldn't ever do this i couldn't ever (17:26 - 17:30)
if i was to go (17:28 - 17:33)
and buy even a 5 000 booster box (17:30 - 17:35)
and write it off as a business expense (17:33 - 17:36)
and then (17:35 - 17:40)
sell those packs to my audience for (17:36 - 17:43)
what however much 5000 divided by 36 is (17:40 - 17:44)
i can't do the math (17:43 - 17:46)
but then you of course put a little on (17:44 - 17:47)
top because you got to cover shipping (17:46 - 17:49)
you got to cover the event you bake your (17:47 - 17:50)
profit (17:49 - 17:52)
but i couldn't ever be in that situation (17:50 - 17:53)
where like a viewer (17:52 - 17:58)
or a fan of my content spends 300 (17:53 - 18:01)
and i open their pack and they it either (17:58 - 18:02)
goes two ways right (18:01 - 18:05)
it either they get a card that is worth (18:02 - 18:06)
more than 200 (18:05 - 18:08)
which is normally these older packs have (18:06 - 18:10)
a couple cards that are worth more than (18:08 - 18:11)
the pack you're buying that's why the (18:10 - 18:13)
pack is so expensive right (18:11 - 18:16)
like a 700 pack always has the chance of (18:13 - 18:19)
having a card worth more than 700 (18:16 - 18:21)
that's why the pack itself is 700 but (18:19 - 18:23)
that pack also has (18:21 - 18:26)
a higher chance of having a card (18:23 - 18:28)
worth significantly less than seven (18:26 - 18:30)
hundred dollars (18:28 - 18:31)
so i couldn't ever be like well i'm (18:30 - 18:33)
opening uh (18:31 - 18:37)
bobby's pack here good luck bobby uh (18:33 - 18:39)
sorry bobby you just got an oddish uh (18:37 - 18:40)
but if you know if you (18:39 - 18:43)
psa graded it's worth like twenty (18:40 - 18:45)
dollars (18:43 - 18:48)
anyways so this happened between (18:45 - 18:50)
darkness ablaze and vivid voltage (18:48 - 18:53)
and champion's path i don't think i'm (18:50 - 18:56)
i don't think logan paul for the record (18:53 - 18:58)
i don't think that (18:56 - 19:00)
he did what i just explained i think he (18:58 - 19:02)
opened a lot of old packs with (19:00 - 19:05)
a lot of his creator friends and he (19:02 - 19:06)
pulled (19:05 - 19:07)
i think he was originally looking for (19:06 - 19:09)
charizard he pulled charizard and then (19:07 - 19:10)
he stopped opening packs that's (19:09 - 19:12)
literally all he wanted is he (19:10 - 19:14)
bought older packs to find a charizard (19:12 - 19:16)
he found a charizard and he was good (19:14 - 19:19)
that was it but the other content (19:16 - 19:20)
creators took this to a level of (19:19 - 19:22)
well everyone seems to be hyped into (19:20 - 19:24)
pokemon cards i'm gonna buy pokemon (19:22 - 19:26)
cards because if you're a big content (19:24 - 19:27)
creator (19:26 - 19:28)
twenty thousand dollars is like not you (19:27 - 19:30)
could probably like (19:28 - 19:32)
when i say big i mean like you know (19:30 - 19:34)
millions of subscribers on youtube (19:32 - 19:35)
you probably make twenty thousand (19:34 - 19:37)
dollars back in a single youtube video (19:35 - 19:38)
honestly at that point (19:37 - 19:40)
this went from youtube to twitch to (19:38 - 19:42)
wherever else content is made (19:40 - 19:44)
i will say one thing about pokemon (19:42 - 19:46)
content creators (19:44 - 19:49)
they are the most uncreative (19:46 - 19:51)
six months late to everything people (19:49 - 19:53)
when it comes to creating content (19:51 - 19:55)
pokemon content creators never come up (19:53 - 19:56)
with anything original (19:55 - 19:58)
they always they always get it from like (19:56 - 20:00)
fashion content creators or (19:58 - 20:02)
sports content create like they are (20:00 - 20:04)
always late to the game (20:02 - 20:07)
and so a bunch of non-pokemon content (20:04 - 20:08)
creators (20:07 - 20:12)
made buying very expensive older pokemon (20:08 - 20:13)
cards (20:12 - 20:16)
popular and they saw that they were (20:13 - 20:16)
making money (20:16 - 20:18)
and getting a ton of views off it so (20:16 - 20:20)
they were like well i baked pokemon i (20:18 - 20:22)
already so they started doing it too (20:20 - 20:24)
again this is the short version the long (20:22 - 20:25)
version will be on youtube (20:24 - 20:27)
[Laughter] (20:25 - 20:30)
i mean i'm yes i we we discussed this (20:27 - 20:31)
part before so (20:30 - 20:33)
this this much i understand i don't (20:31 - 20:35)
understand how this translates to what's (20:33 - 20:36)
happening now (20:35 - 20:39)
it's mostly perfect timing the between (20:36 - 20:40)
darkness ablaze (20:39 - 20:43)
and between vivid voltage the (20:40 - 20:46)
star cards in both of those sets (20:43 - 20:49)
one is charizard one is pikachu (20:46 - 20:52)
so when you have a lot of the importance (20:49 - 20:54)
here is the non-pokemon content creators (20:52 - 20:57)
opening pokemon cards and because their (20:54 - 20:59)
audience is not primarily pokemon (20:57 - 20:59)
focused (20:59 - 21:02)
they are now interested in pokemon cards (20:59 - 21:04)
because they hear these huge numbers of (21:02 - 21:05)
what cards are worth (21:04 - 21:09)
they can walk into target buy cards (21:05 - 21:12)
that are worth not as much but the (21:09 - 21:14)
barrier to entry is very low right (21:12 - 21:17)
you could buy a 600 pack of an older set (21:14 - 21:18)
and try to pull a 2 (21:17 - 21:21)
000 card or you can walk into target (21:18 - 21:22)
right now (21:21 - 21:24)
and if you buy darkness ablaze for four (21:22 - 21:25)
dollars a pack (21:24 - 21:27)
you can walk away with like a 200 (21:25 - 21:30)
charizard or if you buy vivid voltage a (21:27 - 21:31)
four dollar pack (21:30 - 21:34)
you can walk away with a 300 pikachu so (21:31 - 21:35)
you can see how this translates very (21:34 - 21:36)
easily (21:35 - 21:39)
hey i can't buy what big content creator (21:36 - 21:40)
is buying (21:39 - 21:43)
but i can buy four dollars and walk away (21:40 - 21:44)
with three 300 (21:43 - 21:48)
so all of these people rushed out to buy (21:44 - 21:51)
vivid voltage champions path darkness (21:48 - 21:52)
ablaze (21:51 - 21:54)
those are like the main ones um and (21:52 - 21:56)
those are also the newest ones (21:54 - 21:58)
and now pokemon cards are hard to find (21:56 - 22:00)
because of this (21:58 - 22:03)
i just is it really that many people (22:00 - 22:05)
who have been suckered into this form of (22:03 - 22:08)
bizarre gambling (22:05 - 22:11)
yeah yes but also (22:08 - 22:13)
also the skull the scalpers jumped in as (22:11 - 22:14)
well (22:13 - 22:17)
there are people who bought cases (22:14 - 22:19)
of vivid voltage so here here's the (22:17 - 22:21)
crazy thing (22:19 - 22:24)
i have been buying pokemon cards since (22:21 - 22:27)
our gold soul silver undaunted and that (22:24 - 22:28)
was um (22:27 - 22:30)
kind of the end of the line for gen 4 (22:28 - 22:32)
before gen 5 came out which was (22:30 - 22:34)
based at black and white noble victors (22:32 - 22:36)
emerging powers (22:34 - 22:38)
and so when i and this is when will also (22:36 - 22:40)
got a pokemon cards i believe was based (22:38 - 22:40)
at black white (22:40 - 22:44)
yeah when i would buy pokemon cards (22:40 - 22:46)
you could either go to target and spend (22:44 - 22:47)
four dollars a pack (22:46 - 22:51)
or you can go to like cool stuff inc (22:47 - 22:53)
or trolling toad or all these online (22:51 - 22:57)
shops and you can get 36 packs for 99 (22:53 - 22:59)
and that's how it always was now msrp on (22:57 - 23:01)
that is 149. (22:59 - 23:04)
if you do 149 divided by 36 that comes (23:01 - 23:05)
to four dollars a pack (23:04 - 23:09)
but if you do 30 if you do 99 divided (23:05 - 23:10)
which is what most online shops were (23:09 - 23:12)
selling the reason they sell that low is (23:10 - 23:15)
because they buy in such bulk (23:12 - 23:18)
that they can sell it at 99 and still (23:15 - 23:20)
make a profit and move them faster (23:18 - 23:22)
but 99 divided by 36 comes to like three (23:20 - 23:23)
dollars and seven cents a pack (23:22 - 23:26)
so you're saving a dollar a pack by just (23:23 - 23:28)
buying 36 packs which is (23:26 - 23:30)
a lot of money so this is where it comes (23:28 - 23:31)
into why breaks (23:30 - 23:35)
can be good if i only have fifty dollars (23:31 - 23:38)
to spend on pokemon cards and i walk (23:35 - 23:39)
into target (23:38 - 23:42)
i can only get 12 packs with my 50 (23:39 - 23:44)
and that's my limit i only have 50 i (23:42 - 23:46)
walk into target i buy four dollar packs (23:44 - 23:48)
i can only get 12 packs but if i was to (23:46 - 23:49)
go to will (23:48 - 23:51)
and i say hey will i only have fifty (23:49 - 23:53)
dollars you only have fifty dollars (23:51 - 23:55)
we together with a hundred dollars we (23:53 - 23:58)
can buy 36 packs and 36 divided by (23:55 - 24:01)
two is 18 so for the same amount of (23:58 - 24:01)
money (24:01 - 24:04)
if we go in together a break we're (24:01 - 24:05)
breaking the box in half (24:04 - 24:08)
we get six more packs each for the same (24:05 - 24:09)
price (24:08 - 24:12)
so this is why brakes can be good (24:09 - 24:15)
because you can get more packs for your (24:12 - 24:17)
money but the breaks i explained (24:15 - 24:20)
earlier are ripping you off (24:17 - 24:23)
because they because you could just go (24:20 - 24:24)
to ebay (24:23 - 24:27)
and buy a single pack of cards (24:24 - 24:31)
team rocket fossil that is weighed (24:27 - 24:33)
older packs can be weighed because they (24:31 - 24:35)
don't have that white or green card in (24:33 - 24:37)
to offset the balance (24:35 - 24:40)
so you might spend 500 on a (24:37 - 24:44)
fossil pack unweighed or you might want (24:40 - 24:45)
to spend 600 (24:44 - 24:47)
on a fossil pack that weighs a certain (24:45 - 24:48)
amount (24:47 - 24:50)
meaning that it's very likely that (24:48 - 24:52)
there's a hollow in that pack because it (24:50 - 24:52)
weighs (24:52 - 24:55)
more but these break boxes that people (24:52 - 24:56)
are doing of like (24:55 - 24:59)
hey we got 30 spots you want to buy in (24:56 - 24:59)
for (24:59 - 25:00)
hundred dollars one that's more (24:59 - 25:02)
expensive than ebay two (25:00 - 25:04)
you know that person is not weighing (25:02 - 25:06)
those packs because they're opening it (25:04 - 25:07)
live on stream (25:06 - 25:10)
so you are paying a premium for an (25:07 - 25:11)
unweighed (25:10 - 25:12)
old pack and why would you ever do that (25:11 - 25:14)
unless you want your just like name (25:12 - 25:16)
and lights and get shouted out or be a (25:14 - 25:18)
part of something people do want to feel (25:16 - 25:21)
a part of something i get it well that's (25:18 - 25:23)
that's part of what i also don't (25:21 - 25:25)
understand right that that (25:23 - 25:27)
it just does not move my soul in the (25:25 - 25:28)
slightest bit (25:27 - 25:31)
nah i'll shout somebody out what do you (25:28 - 25:31)
who (25:31 - 25:33)
wants to be shouted out send me 800 (25:31 - 25:35)
dollars and i'll shout you out i guess (25:33 - 25:38)
it's like the weirdest thing to me (25:35 - 25:39)
because that's a lot of (25:38 - 25:43)
money yes it is for a person (25:39 - 25:46)
for a person to say your name who knows (25:43 - 25:48)
nothing about you they were literally (25:46 - 25:51)
handed a piece of paper and they read it (25:48 - 25:53)
i i mean i honestly think my limits are (25:51 - 25:55)
it's like i will give you (25:53 - 25:58)
ten dollars to say my name (25:55 - 25:59)
and if you're gonna give money to (25:58 - 26:01)
charity i'll give you 25. (25:59 - 26:05)
there you go maybe (26:01 - 26:08)
like you have to have you have to have a (26:05 - 26:10)
huge following you have to say my name (26:08 - 26:11)
and where they can (26:10 - 26:14)
follow me give me give me access to your (26:11 - 26:15)
audience (26:14 - 26:18)
noble victors uh emerging powers (26:15 - 26:20)
every every set that i've purchased the (26:18 - 26:22)
36 packs for 99 (26:20 - 26:25)
that's always been a thing i got vivid (26:22 - 26:27)
voltage for 99 (26:25 - 26:29)
i got darkness ablaze for 99 sword and (26:27 - 26:31)
shield for 99. (26:29 - 26:34)
uh rebel clash for 99. now (26:31 - 26:37)
if i wanted to buy vivid voltage one (26:34 - 26:38)
it's sold out everywhere (26:37 - 26:42)
but two if i go to ebay or anywhere else (26:38 - 26:46)
36 packs of vivid voltage msrp 149 (26:42 - 26:49)
normally i could get for 99. now (26:46 - 26:52)
300 for 36 packs double (26:49 - 26:55)
msrp because scalpers (26:52 - 26:59)
bought all of these to then resell (26:55 - 27:01)
because of the demand that happened in (26:59 - 27:02)
the (27:01 - 27:05)
pokemon tcg world i i will say i'm very (27:02 - 27:06)
happy that vanguard is my main game (27:05 - 27:07)
because (27:06 - 27:10)
none of this i (27:07 - 27:13)
i did see somebody express a concern (27:10 - 27:14)
that this was going to impact (27:13 - 27:17)
card availability for people who (27:14 - 27:19)
actually play competitive tcg (27:17 - 27:22)
are are people not like putting up (27:19 - 27:22)
singles (27:22 - 27:26)
on like tcg player or any of the other (27:22 - 27:29)
sites any longer no singles still go up (27:26 - 27:32)
uh like the the the star i can't (27:29 - 27:33)
remember what they're called the star (27:32 - 27:34)
cards the feature cards (27:33 - 27:36)
pretty much the the the the cards that (27:34 - 27:38)
people want to go after (27:36 - 27:40)
the pikachu the charizard and stuff (27:38 - 27:42)
chase cards the chase cards (27:40 - 27:44)
the while they are the more expensive (27:42 - 27:46)
most expensive cards they're they're not (27:44 - 27:47)
competitive (27:46 - 27:48)
no one's using the charizard of the (27:47 - 27:51)
pikachu so like in darkness ablaze (27:48 - 27:53)
one of the most competitive cards is is (27:51 - 27:54)
crowbat (27:53 - 27:56)
uh and i think before this happened (27:54 - 27:57)
crobat was like a (27:56 - 28:01)
9 or 11 card and now it's like a 15 or (27:57 - 28:01)
16 (28:01 - 28:03)
card so it did go up in price but not to (28:01 - 28:04)
the point where (28:03 - 28:07)
it's like oh i can't even play anymore i (28:04 - 28:08)
don't know 60 dollars (28:07 - 28:12)
for one card well 60 for one card was a (28:08 - 28:13)
thing that existed (28:12 - 28:17)
back in sun and moon and it was topu (28:13 - 28:20)
and it was before of this so here's the (28:17 - 28:22)
problem (28:20 - 28:25)
uh i just read chinese shining fates (28:22 - 28:27)
which comes out february 19th it's (28:25 - 28:29)
it's a special set most of it is (28:27 - 28:30)
alternative art (28:29 - 28:34)
190 cards this set crashed pokemon (28:30 - 28:34)
center (28:34 - 28:38)
it is uh you ever said a skateboard you (28:34 - 28:40)
uh i walked into a gamestop a month ago (28:38 - 28:43)
to pre-order pokemon cards one i (28:40 - 28:46)
cannot believe i gave game size of the (28:43 - 28:46)
end of (28:46 - 28:50)
days wow i've (28:46 - 28:52)
never in my life pre-ordered pokemon (28:50 - 28:54)
cards (28:52 - 28:56)
but for me it's not even like i i just (28:54 - 28:58)
want open cards i i have just been (28:56 - 29:01)
collecting cards for so long uh i'm in a (28:58 - 29:03)
position where (29:01 - 29:07)
i can afford to buy a couple packs (29:03 - 29:10)
every now and then and open them and (29:07 - 29:12)
then put them in a binder and like (29:10 - 29:14)
cool i like to collect things sweet this (29:12 - 29:16)
is a thing i can now collect (29:14 - 29:18)
whereas like eight years ago i was (29:16 - 29:20)
struggling to pay my bills and i (29:18 - 29:22)
couldn't collect but i had to sell my (29:20 - 29:23)
cards (29:22 - 29:24)
to literally pay rent at one point in my (29:23 - 29:27)
life and i can't even get cards and now (29:24 - 29:30)
uh in march is the next actual set (29:27 - 29:33)
which is battle styles it's the one with (29:30 - 29:34)
urshifu (29:33 - 29:36)
i was able to pre-order a box of battle (29:34 - 29:37)
styles but (29:36 - 29:40)
it was 120 not 99 i (29:37 - 29:42)
pre-ordered from cool stuff inc that's (29:40 - 29:44)
normally where i go for my cards (29:42 - 29:46)
but there's nothing special about battle (29:44 - 29:48)
styles there's no shiny cards there's no (29:46 - 29:50)
charizard there's no pikachu (29:48 - 29:52)
and so i think it's i think going back (29:50 - 29:54)
to the start of the conversation (29:52 - 29:57)
i do think it's because big non-pokemon (29:54 - 30:00)
content creators got into pokemon cards (29:57 - 30:02)
for a short time i actually think a lot (30:00 - 30:03)
of them don't even care anymore they (30:02 - 30:05)
moved on to the next i think the next (30:03 - 30:06)
thing is rust i think that's what (30:05 - 30:09)
everyone's doing now is rust what's rust (30:06 - 30:11)
are you sure it's not yugioh no rust is (30:09 - 30:12)
like the yeah (30:11 - 30:15)
rest is like the like you kill other (30:12 - 30:17)
people and then they're permanently dead (30:15 - 30:18)
and then you steal your stuff and you (30:17 - 30:19)
build a house and (30:18 - 30:21)
hope that no one kills you and start (30:19 - 30:22)
over um (30:21 - 30:26)
okay it's it's a combination of that (30:22 - 30:30)
the timing of the chase cards being (30:26 - 30:32)
charizard to pikachu and i think the (30:30 - 30:33)
pandemic (30:32 - 30:36)
i think if people could go out to movie (30:33 - 30:38)
theaters they could travel (30:36 - 30:41)
they could uh go to plays (30:38 - 30:44)
sporting games they would have less (30:41 - 30:46)
disposable income (30:44 - 30:48)
to spend on pokemon cards if that makes (30:46 - 30:49)
sense oh (30:48 - 30:51)
isn't that the perfect combination one (30:49 - 30:52)
they're trapped in their homes and all (30:51 - 30:54)
they can do is watch these horrible (30:52 - 30:56)
horrible streamers (30:54 - 30:57)
and then those horrible horrible (30:56 - 30:59)
streamers have convinced them (30:57 - 31:02)
that this is a worthwhile investment for (30:59 - 31:04)
their cash that they're not spending on (31:02 - 31:07)
actual enjoyable experiences you've (31:04 - 31:08)
cracked the nut (31:07 - 31:11)
so i stream every monday wednesday uh (31:08 - 31:15)
on twitch wait you (31:11 - 31:17)
you stream like more days than i know i (31:15 - 31:18)
know i was just (31:17 - 31:20)
trying to squeeze in the promotion there (31:18 - 31:22)
yeah yeah so i (31:20 - 31:23)
i did that answer your question of why (31:22 - 31:26)
pokemon cards are impossible to find (31:23 - 31:29)
i just i i was not picking up i and it's (31:26 - 31:31)
it must be a function of my age on the (31:29 - 31:33)
whole cult of personality (31:31 - 31:37)
i want to be like this person but also (31:33 - 31:40)
i think look here's what it really (31:37 - 31:42)
translates into (31:40 - 31:45)
tweens can now gamble because (31:42 - 31:48)
they can spend their allowances on (31:45 - 31:50)
pokemon cards that they can high roll (31:48 - 31:51)
and try to get that (31:50 - 31:54)
jackpot out of the pack i (31:51 - 31:56)
i do explain this more in depth in the (31:54 - 31:57)
youtube video but the thing i also want (31:56 - 31:58)
to say (31:57 - 32:01)
is that i and i show this on my stream (31:58 - 32:02)
all the time because i open i do open (32:01 - 32:04)
pokemon cards but (32:02 - 32:07)
when they talk about prices of cards (32:04 - 32:10)
so for example let's let's go with the (32:07 - 32:13)
v pikachu v max let's just keep it easy (32:10 - 32:14)
easy (32:13 - 32:17)
for now like that and when i say it's a (32:14 - 32:18)
300 (32:17 - 32:21)
card i mean it is a 300 (32:18 - 32:24)
card if you get it graded and (32:21 - 32:28)
if the grading comes back at psa 10. so (32:24 - 32:29)
if you're selling an (32:28 - 32:32)
ungraded pikachu card it is probably (32:29 - 32:33)
going to be closer to (32:32 - 32:37)
like 200 or maybe even like 150 (32:33 - 32:40)
as opposed to the 300 you can get at max (32:37 - 32:41)
value (32:40 - 32:44)
so with a lot of these streams or (32:41 - 32:47)
or youtube videos it's incredibly (32:44 - 32:48)
misleading (32:47 - 32:50)
because they will open a card like a (32:48 - 32:52)
shining lugia from (32:50 - 32:54)
call of legends or something and they (32:52 - 32:56)
will say oh my gosh this is a two (32:54 - 32:58)
thousand dollar card (32:56 - 33:02)
yes if it's psa graded 10 (32:58 - 33:06)
today because six months ago (33:02 - 33:09)
that lugia card was not two thousand (33:06 - 33:10)
dollars (33:09 - 33:12)
it's two thousand two thousand dollars (33:10 - 33:13)
right here (33:12 - 33:16)
today assuming that it's perfect (33:13 - 33:17)
condition (33:16 - 33:20)
and assuming you're selling it today so (33:17 - 33:22)
the problem with that (33:20 - 33:25)
is if you want to send a card to psa (33:22 - 33:27)
this is the problem with break boxes if (33:25 - 33:28)
you're paying (33:27 - 33:32)
into a break box the 600 (33:28 - 33:35)
and they open it up and you get like a (33:32 - 33:38)
first edition team rocket squirtle (33:35 - 33:40)
yes that team rocket squirtle psa 10 is (33:38 - 33:41)
a 500 (33:40 - 33:44)
500 first edition psa 10 squirtle is a (33:41 - 33:45)
500 (33:44 - 33:48)
card but when you send it in to psa (33:45 - 33:49)
right now today (33:48 - 33:51)
you will not see that card for nine (33:49 - 33:52)
months (33:51 - 33:55)
because psa is nine months behind on (33:52 - 33:56)
grading (33:55 - 33:59)
that squirtle card was not (33:56 - 34:02)
five hundred dollars six months ago it (33:59 - 34:02)
was (34:02 - 34:06)
like forty dollars (34:02 - 34:09)
who is to say one that the card you open (34:06 - 34:11)
is even psa 10 (34:09 - 34:13)
because the difference between a 9.5 and (34:11 - 34:15)
a 10 is hundreds of dollars (34:13 - 34:17)
it's it's actually crazy if you if you (34:15 - 34:20)
pull up psa 10 versus psa 9.5 the the (34:17 - 34:21)
price difference (34:20 - 34:23)
will actually shock you there's some (34:21 - 34:24)
clickbait for you it is actually (34:23 - 34:25)
shocking (34:24 - 34:27)
but then you send the card out and then (34:25 - 34:28)
you get it back (34:27 - 34:30)
people are willing to pay 500 for a (34:28 - 34:32)
squirtle now (34:30 - 34:34)
but in nine months maybe maybe you can (34:32 - 34:36)
travel to canada maybe you can take your (34:34 - 34:39)
vacation to mexico maybe you can go see (34:36 - 34:42)
uh the milwaukee bucks play basketball (34:39 - 34:45)
people will move their money to other (34:42 - 34:46)
things that they (34:45 - 34:49)
cannot literally do right now they (34:46 - 34:50)
cannot go to the basketball games of the (34:49 - 34:53)
baseball games they cannot go to japan (34:50 - 34:55)
so who's to say they're going to pay 500 (34:53 - 34:56)
now (34:55 - 35:00)
and and just final point of like (34:56 - 35:04)
you can't even tell when you buy a box (35:00 - 35:07)
of cards if those cards inside are going (35:04 - 35:09)
to be psa 10. (35:07 - 35:12)
so if you're if you're like well i'm i i (35:09 - 35:13)
got 700 (35:12 - 35:16)
i'm gonna buy i'm gonna buy uh this f uh (35:13 - 35:16)
this (35:16 - 35:18)
this base that fossil i'm gonna hope for (35:16 - 35:19)
the blastoise gonna hope for the (35:18 - 35:20)
charizard (35:19 - 35:23)
and you could get it but if it's if it's (35:20 - 35:25)
if the edges are bad (35:23 - 35:27)
if the the printing is offset like all (35:25 - 35:28)
of these things (35:27 - 35:32)
can instantly it's so you are so (35:28 - 35:35)
not likely to get psa 10. (35:32 - 35:37)
like there are so many things that go (35:35 - 35:40)
wrong in the printing process of these (35:37 - 35:41)
cards like i (35:40 - 35:44)
just opened champions path four packs of (35:41 - 35:47)
champions path yesterday on my stream (35:44 - 35:49)
and the edges on all of the packs were (35:47 - 35:50)
bad (35:49 - 35:53)
and i i didn't know that i literally (35:50 - 35:54)
waited in a line at target (35:53 - 35:58)
i watched the guy unload champions path (35:54 - 36:02)
from his boxes onto the shelf i was the (35:58 - 36:04)
first one to touch it on the shelf (36:02 - 36:07)
i drove it home i opened them and all (36:04 - 36:08)
the edges were bad (36:07 - 36:10)
that was a million percent out of my (36:08 - 36:11)
control (36:10 - 36:13)
out of the dude's computer it's a bad (36:11 - 36:14)
edge bean (36:13 - 36:16)
um so like when you you you know how (36:14 - 36:18)
pokemon cards have the yellow edges (36:16 - 36:19)
and you know how pokemon cards can be (36:18 - 36:21)
reverse hollow so the whole thing but (36:19 - 36:23)
the pokemon is (36:21 - 36:26)
hollow yep if you like tilt it you can (36:23 - 36:28)
see the hollow bleed onto the edge of (36:26 - 36:29)
the card (36:28 - 36:31)
where the yellow was supposed to stop it (36:29 - 36:34)
oh so it's like just a misprint (36:31 - 36:36)
okay i have actually as you've been (36:34 - 36:38)
going through this i finally had (36:36 - 36:43)
my uh aha moment of realization (36:38 - 36:46)
this is literally what happened with (36:43 - 36:50)
tulips in amsterdam in 1637 (36:46 - 36:52)
and that is my key to under if anybody (36:50 - 36:53)
wants to understand what's going on (36:52 - 36:57)
look that up and you will get a clear (36:53 - 36:59)
boy this keeps happening over and over (36:57 - 37:01)
again in human history (36:59 - 37:03)
wow what i'm saying is it's a good time (37:01 - 37:06)
to sell all your old pokemon cards now (37:03 - 37:09)
and then buy them back in the future at (37:06 - 37:11)
a cheaper price when people stop (37:09 - 37:14)
hearing it we said we weren't gonna talk (37:11 - 37:16)
about that (37:14 - 37:16)
look i say this on my other podcast (37:18 - 37:24)
all the time the number one rule (37:21 - 37:27)
about buying cards is cards are for (37:24 - 37:29)
playing games cards are not a financial (37:27 - 37:30)
instrument (37:29 - 37:31)
if you buy cards buy cards because you (37:30 - 37:33)
want to play games with them do not buy (37:31 - 37:34)
cards because you want to finance your (37:33 - 37:35)
college education (37:34 - 37:38)
because one hundred percent guaranteed (37:35 - 37:39)
money (37:38 - 37:40)
has been around we'll put somebody (37:39 - 37:42)
through college whatever no (37:40 - 37:46)
no oh i i have been alive long enough to (37:42 - 37:46)
know (37:46 - 37:49)
that nobody makes money lasting value (37:46 - 37:53)
off of trading cards well we live (37:49 - 37:54)
through the beanie baby (37:53 - 37:57)
baby craze we know the reality and look (37:54 - 37:58)
at how rich those people are yeah how (37:57 - 38:00)
many people do you think walked away (37:58 - 38:01)
from the beanie baby (38:00 - 38:03)
like there's probably a handful of (38:01 - 38:04)
people that made money through beanie (38:03 - 38:06)
babies i would probably say the majority (38:04 - 38:07)
of people (38:06 - 38:09)
just have a room full of useless beanie (38:07 - 38:10)
babies yeah (38:09 - 38:12)
just like a majority people have a room (38:10 - 38:14)
full of useless pokemon cards (38:12 - 38:18)
that they paid some internet stranger (38:14 - 38:19)
seven hundred (38:18 - 38:24)
dollars to say on a youtube video (38:19 - 38:26)
there are there is one cool thing that (38:24 - 38:27)
uh (38:26 - 38:30)
a couple content creators do uh one (38:27 - 38:33)
is uh my friend reel breaking nate he (38:30 - 38:34)
does break it (38:33 - 38:37)
he does the breakbox thing as well but (38:34 - 38:39)
he doesn't charge anyone for it (38:37 - 38:43)
he just he's like we got 36 spots (38:39 - 38:45)
i'm gonna pick random people who comment (38:43 - 38:46)
on my youtube videos or who retweet my (38:45 - 38:48)
tweets (38:46 - 38:50)
i pay he pays for the shipping he'll say (38:48 - 38:52)
like greg this is your pack (38:50 - 38:54)
hope you get something good open the (38:52 - 38:56)
pack cool (38:54 - 38:58)
you got something all right let me know (38:56 - 38:59)
your address i'm gonna mail it your way (38:58 - 39:00)
if you want me to sign (38:59 - 39:03)
anything cool no cost to you and (39:00 - 39:07)
that i i have huge respect for (39:03 - 39:11)
because it's one he's still probably (39:07 - 39:14)
guaranteed making the money back on the (39:11 - 39:15)
content itself right (39:14 - 39:17)
whether he spends like two hundred (39:15 - 39:20)
dollars or a thousand dollars on the box (39:17 - 39:22)
he's probably making that back with ad (39:20 - 39:24)
revenue and stuff two (39:22 - 39:25)
great thing to do for the community very (39:24 - 39:27)
exciting people feel like oh cool i (39:25 - 39:29)
gotta pack here i get my name shouted (39:27 - 39:30)
out i get something from my favorite (39:29 - 39:31)
content creator (39:30 - 39:33)
and three there's like it's not a (39:31 - 39:35)
lose-lose situation right (39:33 - 39:38)
if you spend seven hundred dollars and (39:35 - 39:41)
you pull a two thousand 000 (39:38 - 39:45)
lugio card you probably feel like (39:41 - 39:46)
you've gone to the moon and back right (39:45 - 39:48)
that's an incredible feeling (39:46 - 39:50)
it's like the same thing of winning a (39:48 - 39:53)
lottery ticket but if you spend 700 (39:50 - 39:56)
and they open a five dollar (39:53 - 40:00)
persian card not only does it feel unju (39:56 - 40:02)
it feels so not genuine for the content (40:00 - 40:04)
creator to be like oh well you know (40:02 - 40:07)
uh persian is okay (40:04 - 40:09)
but if you want me to sign it i will (40:07 - 40:11)
like not only (40:09 - 40:12)
is your favorite content creator (40:11 - 40:14)
suddenly faking this like (40:12 - 40:17)

you've (40:17 - 40:20)
also just lost a bunch of money on top (40:17 - 40:21)
of that (40:20 - 40:24)
so like even if uh so in a free (40:21 - 40:26)
situation where i'm like hey i'm buying (40:24 - 40:28)
a box of darkness ablaze (40:26 - 40:29)
if if we pull you the charizard or the (40:28 - 40:31)
crowbat cool hype if not (40:29 - 40:33)

over the weekend i think i fell in love (46:03 - 46:07)

great difficulty sitting let me look at (46:11 - 46:14)
this feel plush (46:13 - 46:17)

it's a big round i kinda really like the (46:19 - 46:24)
shell gone plush (46:22 - 46:28)
what he he looks cute he looks cozy (46:24 - 46:31)
said nobody ever don't look don't don't (46:28 - 46:33)

too excited about these plushes (46:35 - 46:38)

just because there's been so much (47:02 - 47:06)
jirachi merch already (47:04 - 47:09)

there might be some people who don't (50:44 - 50:48)
know it's godzilla as a robot (50:45 - 50:52)
okay next so imagine pikachu (50:48 - 50:56)
wearing a mechagodzilla costume (50:52 - 51:00)

made (51:03 - 51:07)
of pu and what is pu and resin (51:03 - 51:10)

why is it so angry i mean it's we're in (51:26 - 51:30)
a (51:29 - 51:32)
it's role playing oh i just saw that it (51:30 - 51:33)
should be (51:32 - 51:36)
the more that it's cosplaying the the (51:33 - 51:36)
picture (51:36 - 51:38)
in the article is a really bad angle if (51:36 - 51:39)
you look at like the (51:38 - 51:41)
whole behind picture it looks pretty (51:39 - 51:43)
good yeah (51:41 - 51:46)

emotions (51:54 - 51:58)
if it was programmed yeah yeah does it (51:55 - 51:58)
no (51:58 - 52:01)
you gotta program the emotions in that (51:58 - 52:03)
does that means they're fake programmed (52:01 - 52:04)
emotions they're not real but if there's (52:03 - 52:06)
only 398 pieces (52:04 - 52:09)

398 pieces (52:09 - 52:12)
yeah they said it was limited 400 well (52:11 - 52:15)
oh that what a weird way to put it (52:12 - 52:16)
well yeah they should just say limit 400 (52:15 - 52:18)
like no like why generally like (52:16 - 52:22)
yes if you make 400 i'm assuming one (52:18 - 52:22)
person (52:22 - 52:25)
the creator gets one and then probably (52:22 - 52:25)
one person (52:25 - 52:30)
like i two yes just put 400 though don't (52:25 - 52:30)
like (52:30 - 52:33)

lock it in yes yes and then (52:53 - 52:59)
i mean it doesn't ship until like (52:56 - 53:00)
september october (52:59 - 53:03)
estimated because they're hand carving (53:00 - 53:05)
from the polyurethane (53:03 - 53:07)
yes oh wait this website says there's (53:05 - 53:09)
more pikachus (53:07 - 53:12)
wait is there an actual godz there is a (53:09 - 53:13)
godzilla pikachu (53:12 - 53:15)
that pikachu is way cuter what does this (53:13 - 53:17)
ride choose (53:15 - 53:19)
this company has a lot of pokemon resin (53:17 - 53:20)
statues (53:19 - 53:23)
yeah are are these official these have (53:20 - 53:25)
to be official right (53:23 - 53:28)
i would imagine they must be otherwise (53:25 - 53:30)
this company would be sued (53:28 - 53:32)
but this pikachu wearing a gatomon (53:30 - 53:34)
costume i have to investigate more in (53:32 - 53:35)
this company (53:34 - 53:37)
i'm giving i am giving anyone my money (53:35 - 53:39)
for fake pokemon merch i only want the (53:37 - 53:40)
most legit (53:39 - 53:43)
merch that will appreciate in value as (53:40 - 53:45)
it sits in my closet (53:43 - 53:48)
of course they have a lot (53:45 - 53:50)
they have a lot they have so much they (53:48 - 53:52)
can they have to have a deal (53:50 - 53:55)
right because like this is way too much (53:52 - 53:56)
and way too easily found (53:55 - 53:59)
all right let's shift gears over to (53:56 - 54:00)
valentine's day (53:59 - 54:03)
this is off pokemon.com valentine's or (54:00 - 54:05)
make that (54:03 - 54:08)
palentines get it greg (54:05 - 54:11)
get it no neither (54:08 - 54:14)
passio valentine pal (54:11 - 54:17)
palentine i thought it was to take the (54:14 - 54:18)
romance out of it because you're just (54:17 - 54:20)
pals (54:18 - 54:22)
because they're celebrating friendship (54:20 - 54:25)
oh yeah i got that yeah (54:22 - 54:27)
i didn't get it then because i thought (54:25 - 54:29)
the p was for passion (54:27 - 54:32)
it would be wow (54:29 - 54:32)
but you know i i'll give him a little (54:34 - 54:38)
bit of credit because i think (54:35 - 54:41)
i think pal was really just like big in (54:38 - 54:42)
the 70s (54:41 - 54:46)
it was like hey pal how you doing oh (54:42 - 54:48)
i've really lost all drive to read the (54:46 - 54:49)
story (54:48 - 54:53)
now i will read it all right you read it (54:49 - 54:56)
all right valentine or make that (54:53 - 54:59)
palantines bring don and el cremie and (54:56 - 55:02)
serena and whimsicott to pokemon masters (54:59 - 55:03)
ex (55:02 - 55:06)
you've heard of valentine's day but on (55:03 - 55:08)
the island of pacio there's a special (55:06 - 55:08)
event that (55:08 - 55:12)
celebrates friendship valentine's day (55:08 - 55:16)
from january 28th 2021 to february 18th (55:12 - 55:19)
2021 you could experience valentine's (55:16 - 55:22)
day for yourself in pokemon masters ex (55:19 - 55:24)
during this time you can play through (55:22 - 55:26)
the baking buddies story event (55:24 - 55:28)
which follows serena and dawn as they (55:26 - 55:30)
pair as they prepare some (55:28 - 55:33)
tasty treats for their friends the (55:30 - 55:34)
battles you participate (55:33 - 55:36)
in throughout the story event will earn (55:34 - 55:37)
you rewards they can be exchanged for (55:36 - 55:40)
other useful items and there's a bunch (55:37 - 55:42)
of stuff about sync pairs that nobody (55:40 - 55:42)
cares about (55:42 - 55:45)
yeah serena and whimsicott are pullable (55:42 - 55:49)
uh and then starting in the 31st done in (55:45 - 55:50)
el cremy (55:49 - 55:52)
yeah by the time this podcast goes up (55:50 - 55:53)
you should be able to get (55:52 - 55:56)
dawn and el cremie people wanted more (55:53 - 55:59)
holiday sink bears (55:56 - 55:59)
yes it was the thing that people voted (56:00 - 56:03)
on and then they (56:02 - 56:06)
remember the survey (56:03 - 56:06)
i mean vaguely and now (56:06 - 56:12)
that she's they they're pumping out a (56:10 - 56:13)
holiday sync i mean they (56:12 - 56:15)
they listened people wanted holiday (56:13 - 56:17)
sling bears say they are i like the (56:15 - 56:17)
outfits (56:17 - 56:20)
i think they're good yeah they're cute i (56:17 - 56:22)
haven't started the story line yet i (56:20 - 56:22)
have not started it (56:22 - 56:24)
either full disclosure i am partnered (56:22 - 56:26)
with dna (56:24 - 56:31)
i am curious (56:26 - 56:34)
it just they gave (56:31 - 56:37)
dawn alcremy which i felt like was a (56:34 - 56:38)
guaranteed (56:37 - 56:41)
for opal to have yeah you could you (56:38 - 56:43)
could make the argument that like (56:41 - 56:45)
they have said they're bringing giganta (56:43 - 56:47)
max to the game (56:45 - 56:49)
and that opel would get giganta maxell (56:47 - 56:51)
cremy (56:49 - 56:53)
and then obviously i guess leon would (56:51 - 56:55)
get gigantomax char there's no way they (56:53 - 56:57)
introduced leon without introducing (56:55 - 57:00)
chart like you can't give leon anything (56:57 - 57:02)
but charizard this is like literally his (57:00 - 57:03)
pokemon (57:02 - 57:06)
it's pretty accurate yeah so i guess (57:03 - 57:07)
they could just give opel (57:06 - 57:10)
gigantomax a cremi but then it's like (57:07 - 57:12)
so many other pokemon are being (57:10 - 57:14)
forgotten there are not (57:12 - 57:16)
eight hundred and ninety-eight trainers (57:14 - 57:19)
that exist in the pokemon world (57:16 - 57:20)
there are eight hundred and eighty nine (57:19 - 57:24)
pokemons you have plenty of options (57:20 - 57:26)
i mean they could do glare and rapidash (57:24 - 57:27)
for opal (57:26 - 57:31)
yeah i mean it matches your colors (57:27 - 57:34)
more wheezing gallerian wheezing yeah i (57:31 - 57:34)
mean (57:34 - 57:37)
she opens with wheezing i think right (57:34 - 57:41)
it's like wheezing rapidash togekiss (57:37 - 57:41)
in the game she has wheezing i think her (57:44 - 57:48)
actual team is in the star tournament or (57:46 - 57:49)
in the gym battle oh and then (57:48 - 57:51)
everybody is the star turtle in the gym (57:49 - 57:52)
battle i think it's wheezing together (57:51 - 57:55)
cremi and then the star tournament i (57:52 - 57:55)
think (57:55 - 57:57)
it's she has like a mall while in a (57:55 - 57:58)
rapidash as well (57:57 - 58:03)
now she she has a wheezing mile (57:58 - 58:04)
together kissing the cremate at the gym (58:03 - 58:06)
okay star tournament (58:04 - 58:08)
extractor meant mobile is dropped like a (58:06 - 58:09)
hot potato (58:08 - 58:11)
but she doesn't have rapidash so it will (58:09 - 58:13)
probably (58:11 - 58:17)
not not mind you that they (58:13 - 58:19)
that they are tied to anything in the (58:17 - 58:21)
games they can do whatever they want (58:19 - 58:22)
they can yeah (58:21 - 58:24)
but for the most part they've been (58:22 - 58:26)
following some sort of logic (58:24 - 58:29)
i mean stephen did get metagross (58:26 - 58:31)
[Laughter] (58:29 - 58:33)
we would assume diantha whenever she (58:31 - 58:34)
shows up in the next (58:33 - 58:37)
20 years we'll get gardavoria still on (58:34 - 58:38)
that screen but (58:37 - 58:42)
still not in the game greatest greatest (58:38 - 58:46)
champion cut from the game (58:42 - 58:47)
hey people want more fairy type (58:46 - 58:49)
attackers here they are (58:47 - 58:51)
i mean are they good though that i don't (58:49 - 58:53)
know i don't i haven't looked at (58:51 - 58:55)
what people feel about them or or or (58:53 - 58:58)
whatnot i think cosmetically people like (58:55 - 59:01)
the dawn one better but you know people (58:58 - 59:02)
love serena (59:01 - 59:04)
but that's happening right now and we (59:02 - 59:07)
are getting awfully close to the (59:04 - 59:10)
year and a half celebration yeah so (59:07 - 59:14)
they have a they've got a ton of (59:10 - 59:16)
god they just added a bunch of stuff (59:14 - 59:18)
into the (59:16 - 59:20)
list and not all of them are great like (59:18 - 59:21)
they're just (59:20 - 59:24)
there are we talking about masters (59:21 - 59:24)
whether used (59:24 - 59:27)
whether they're worth pulling or not oh (59:24 - 59:28)
just characters in general (59:27 - 59:29)
yeah cause like they added mallow and (59:28 - 59:31)
serena and it's just like (59:29 - 59:34)
that offers nothing to the game i'm (59:31 - 59:35)
trying to think of what i use (59:34 - 59:38)
normally for grass i mean you have two (59:35 - 59:42)
you have two exes in superior and (59:38 - 59:43)
venusaur (59:42 - 59:44)
malo and this is the problem i talked (59:43 - 59:46)
about before mello is a five star with (59:44 - 59:48)
no ex potential at this point and (59:46 - 59:49)
probably doesn't have (59:48 - 59:52)
an unlike grid it is just a banner that (59:49 - 59:55)
doesn't add to the game that arguably if (59:52 - 59:57)
you like really like this pair (59:55 - 59:59)
they are going to be frustrating to use (59:57 - 60:01)
because there are already existing pairs (59:59 - 60:02)
that do (60:01 - 60:04)
everything better i'm just not going to (60:02 - 60:07)
pull on that banner (60:04 - 60:07)
you don't pull out any of the banners i (60:08 - 60:11)
don't even know what those words mean (60:09 - 60:14)
they just came out of my mouth (60:11 - 60:17)
it is to the point where it's very hard (60:14 - 60:18)
to pull on every banner unless you're (60:17 - 60:20)
paying money (60:18 - 60:23)
yeah i mean at the point i mean yeah (60:20 - 60:24)
it's a gotcha game (60:23 - 60:28)
but like the last few like the last few (60:24 - 60:30)
banners and pairs that they've put up i (60:28 - 60:31)
think only (60:30 - 60:34)
end and may have been really worth (60:31 - 60:35)
pulling for (60:34 - 60:37)
i mean i think of it like pokemon go (60:35 - 60:38)
they were bad (60:37 - 60:41)
whereas i don't think i've done i (60:38 - 60:43)
haven't paid for a five-star rate and go (60:41 - 60:45)
since the regis because everything's (60:43 - 60:47)
been repeats now (60:45 - 60:49)
it's been like the rykos and the ho-ohs (60:47 - 60:51)
and the lugias and the (60:49 - 60:53)
and it's been actually great because i (60:51 - 60:54)
have all those (60:53 - 60:56)
so i can just skip them and my wallet is (60:54 - 60:58)
very happy so when i (60:56 - 61:01)
just like saw mallow and zarina (60:58 - 61:04)
i do want them because i like collecting (61:01 - 61:05)
one of every poke (61:04 - 61:08)
pair but hey i'll wait (61:05 - 61:10)
and so we can have some lackluster like (61:08 - 61:11)
i i (61:10 - 61:14)
do really want dawn and i'll crammy so i (61:11 - 61:16)
will save my gems and pull on her (61:14 - 61:19)
um but sometimes lackluster pairs (61:16 - 61:23)
and whether that's go or masters i hate (61:19 - 61:26)
i'll take it as a my wallet is happy (61:23 - 61:27)
this week (61:26 - 61:30)
yeah it's just is the growing (61:27 - 61:33)
it's just a problem with all of these (61:30 - 61:36)
that they have limited banners for (61:33 - 61:40)
things that aren't aren't going to help (61:36 - 61:41)
you do the game like (61:40 - 61:44)
they just aren't great yet they're still (61:41 - 61:45)
five-star (61:44 - 61:49)
for pay banners like and it's it (61:45 - 61:51)
i always find it sort of frust like if i (61:49 - 61:52)
think there should be a fairly good (61:51 - 61:54)
balance at the things that (61:52 - 61:56)
that you're promoting and they should (61:54 - 61:58)
serve a purpose and shouldn't just be (61:56 - 62:00)
dumped into the game but we're kind of (61:58 - 62:03)
at that point in masters where you have (62:00 - 62:04)
the set things that are good (62:03 - 62:06)
and they want to add pairs so they're (62:04 - 62:08)
just dumping things in (62:06 - 62:11)
which is like it's good if you do the (62:08 - 62:11)
research (62:11 - 62:13)
it's bad if you think oh this is going (62:11 - 62:14)
to be a great pair and i really like (62:13 - 62:16)
this pair and then you try to use them (62:14 - 62:18)
because they're just in no way shape or (62:16 - 62:20)
form up to any of the tasks (62:18 - 62:22)
you want them to do last bit of news (62:20 - 62:24)
here is off pokemon go live (62:22 - 62:26)
uh feel the love with pokemon go's (62:24 - 62:28)

hey did you guys finish your a joto oh (62:28 - 62:34)
don't get me started (62:32 - 62:38)
looking and trying and having people ask (62:34 - 62:40)
me about that just brought out one (62:38 - 62:42)
realization for me i don't like pokemon (62:40 - 62:43)
go (62:42 - 62:45)
i don't like the game the only reason i (62:43 - 62:47)
enjoy playing it is when i get to play (62:45 - 62:50)
in person with my friends otherwise (62:47 - 62:54)
i don't like this game at all that just (62:50 - 62:57)
the the the blank mill tank silhouette (62:54 - 63:01)
staring at me so cruelly and i was like (62:57 - 63:05)
really melting the toughest one to find (63:01 - 63:06)
i feel like (63:05 - 63:08)
i still haven't found one i haven't (63:06 - 63:09)
looked (63:08 - 63:11)
i went to the mall to pick up some five (63:09 - 63:12)
guys and (63:11 - 63:15)
no joke every single pokemon spawned at (63:12 - 63:16)
once (63:15 - 63:19)
i found two larva tar there was one mil (63:16 - 63:19)
tank (63:19 - 63:21)
there's the murkrow there was all the (63:19 - 63:24)
starters oh it was it was great i (63:21 - 63:27)
it was the easiest weekend i (63:24 - 63:29)
literally opened pokemon go this morning (63:27 - 63:31)
and a cub chew (63:29 - 63:33)
popped up and i literally said get out (63:31 - 63:35)
of here (63:33 - 63:38)
nobody loves you yeah for being a (63:35 - 63:40)
limited time come true event (63:38 - 63:43)
that bear still really stuck around (63:40 - 63:46)
that bear and it's not hanging around (63:43 - 63:48)
let me see i'm looking at my collection (63:46 - 63:50)

for how many i caught (63:54 - 63:57)
i say you're missing three like during (63:56 - 63:59)
the challenge time (63:57 - 64:01)
yeah like as of right now i'm just (63:59 - 64:03)
pulled it open (64:01 - 64:05)
there's a list of pokemon to catch how (64:03 - 64:07)

understand that the fact that i don't go (64:55 - 64:59)
outside of my house (64:57 - 65:01)
and taking pictures are in conflict (64:59 - 65:03)
because i've got too much furniture (65:01 - 65:05)
i don't have room for these pokemon to (65:03 - 65:09)
be running around in my house (65:05 - 65:12)

that's it that's a lot of pokemon go (70:50 - 70:55)
stuff (70:53 - 70:59)
and that i think is all the news so (70:55 - 71:01)
we've gotten through it all let's jump (70:59 - 71:03)
to our question (71:01 - 71:07)
of the week it's not unusual to have the (71:03 - 71:10)
question of the week (71:07 - 71:12)
that was brief yeah that's gonna be a (71:10 - 71:14)
second verse (71:12 - 71:15)
no i mean i could i could go on like i (71:14 - 71:17)
wrote verses for days (71:15 - 71:19)
but like let's get let's get into the (71:17 - 71:20)
brass tacks people (71:19 - 71:22)
this is from brandon uh if you could (71:20 - 71:25)
make a godzilla verse kong movie (71:22 - 71:28)
in the style of pokemon what would it be (71:25 - 71:29)
i mean that answer is obvious it's (71:28 - 71:31)
gigantic max (71:29 - 71:34)
tyranitar versus giganta max really boom (71:31 - 71:36)
[Laughter] (71:34 - 71:41)
excellent that's pretty good (71:36 - 71:44)
i guess we're done here (71:41 - 71:44)
well what about zarud oh wait that's (71:45 - 71:49)
right nobody got the email nobody got (71:47 - 71:51)
the email (71:49 - 71:53)
[Music] (71:51 - 71:55)
my problem is that my favorite favorite (71:53 - 71:57)
favorite favorite kaiju (71:55 - 72:01)
is mothra so i would say (71:57 - 72:05)
you can bring in gigantomax butterfree (72:01 - 72:07)
that's not a moth that's a butterfly get (72:05 - 72:08)
your lepidoptera correct (72:07 - 72:11)
ugh i'm just (72:08 - 72:11)
i will dynamax a mautham (72:11 - 72:17)
dynamics or a vena (72:14 - 72:21)
moth something like that they need a (72:17 - 72:22)
gigantomax uh (72:21 - 72:25)
venom off absolutely not everybody can (72:22 - 72:27)
get a gigantic max that's not how this (72:25 - 72:28)
works (72:27 - 72:31)
steven also we'll just do two questions (72:28 - 72:33)
here uh to celebrate this year this (72:31 - 72:35)
launch of series eight which (72:33 - 72:37)
actually starts tonight or by the time (72:35 - 72:38)
this podcast is up (72:37 - 72:40)
uh what advice and lessons would you (72:38 - 72:42)
give to an inexperienced player who (72:40 - 72:44)
would want to get into competitive (72:42 - 72:45)
battles (72:44 - 72:47)
don't yeah that's probably the the (72:45 - 72:49)
correct answer (72:47 - 72:52)
the only a friend (72:49 - 72:55)
who enjoys breeding competitive pokemon (72:52 - 72:56)
and have them breed your team for you so (72:55 - 72:58)
that you don't have to waste your time (72:56 - 72:58)
doing that (72:58 - 73:01)
i mean the good thing about sargeant you (72:58 - 73:03)
can rent teams right like you can find (73:01 - 73:06)
stuff like so try out a bunch of teams (73:03 - 73:09)
in this format to see what style of play (73:06 - 73:10)
you like (73:09 - 73:12)
before you have to do all the hard work (73:10 - 73:14)
of trying to build your own (73:12 - 73:16)
yeah that's really good advice actually (73:14 - 73:17)
is instead of (73:16 - 73:20)
a lot of times you see people that this (73:17 - 73:21)
is this is the standard (73:20 - 73:24)
procedure people go i want to get into (73:21 - 73:25)
competitive (73:24 - 73:28)
you go okay and they don't (73:25 - 73:31)
look at anything competitive related (73:28 - 73:34)
they think of a team that they like (73:31 - 73:36)
and then they spend like three weeks (73:34 - 73:37)
building the team (73:36 - 73:40)
they're like i'm gonna shiny hunt the (73:37 - 73:41)
the (73:40 - 73:43)
the fee bass because i want milotic on (73:41 - 73:45)
the team i'm gonna go catch this (73:43 - 73:48)
i'm gonna go shiny hunt that i'm going (73:45 - 73:49)
to (73:48 - 73:53)
breed zero ivs in this dust clops (73:49 - 73:56)
they do all the work they do all the ev (73:53 - 73:57)
training they do all the breeding (73:56 - 74:00)
they have their their notepad with their (73:57 - 74:01)
spreadsheets and stuff (74:00 - 74:05)
spoiler this was me like 10 years ago um (74:01 - 74:08)
and then after putting in all that time (74:05 - 74:09)
and effort (74:08 - 74:12)
they take their team to go competitively (74:09 - 74:13)
battle on the ladder (74:12 - 74:16)
and then they lose and they're like ah (74:13 - 74:17)
do it again (74:16 - 74:18)
and then they lose and then they get (74:17 - 74:20)
frustrated then they quit competitive (74:18 - 74:23)
this is the standard i want to get into (74:20 - 74:24)
competitive (74:23 - 74:27)
process that pushes people away from (74:24 - 74:31)
competitive it's the wrong approach (74:27 - 74:31)
don't put any effort into building a (74:32 - 74:36)
team and so you know (74:34 - 74:38)
what you like and what you don't like (74:36 - 74:39)
per (74:38 - 74:42)
that format so for example when i say (74:39 - 74:43)
format (74:42 - 74:46)
doraleo don was very good (74:43 - 74:49)
in like series one and series two but (74:46 - 74:50)
we're on series eight (74:49 - 74:53)
and doraleon ain't good anymore no one's (74:50 - 74:55)
using doraldon (74:53 - 74:57)
you might love doraledon i understand (74:55 - 74:59)
but unfortunately (74:57 - 75:01)
there are just other pokemon that fit (74:59 - 75:02)
that role (75:01 - 75:05)
better that replay like better gross you (75:02 - 75:06)
wanna (75:05 - 75:09)
you wanna you wanna steal pokemon (75:06 - 75:12)
that does good damage to fairies (75:09 - 75:13)
doraldon ain't the choice (75:12 - 75:16)
metagross is the choice so yeah like (75:13 - 75:17)
when i (75:16 - 75:18)
i really thought i wanted to run a trick (75:17 - 75:20)
room team initially when i got into (75:18 - 75:21)
competitive i rented a bunch of trick (75:20 - 75:23)
room teams i realized i didn't like that (75:21 - 75:25)
and instead i found out that i really (75:23 - 75:27)
liked i really liked teams that were (75:25 - 75:28)
just (75:27 - 75:31)
bulky so like even though i would (75:28 - 75:34)
i wouldn't win the speed wars like oh (75:31 - 75:36)
i'm i have the fastest pokemon i (75:34 - 75:38)
accepted that i wouldn't win speed wars (75:36 - 75:40)
in return of just having pokemon that (75:38 - 75:41)
had (75:40 - 75:43)
really good survivability so you gotta (75:41 - 75:44)
you gotta see what you like and you (75:43 - 75:46)
don't like that's the same thing in the (75:44 - 75:47)
pokemon trading card game (75:46 - 75:49)
for the most most of the time all (75:47 - 75:51)
electric decks are pretty (75:49 - 75:54)
much the same they usually grab energy (75:51 - 75:55)
they usually discard energy and they (75:54 - 75:57)
grab that energy back from the discard (75:55 - 75:57)
pile (75:57 - 76:00)
usually grass decks move around energy (75:57 - 76:01)
on the field (76:00 - 76:03)
usually water decks take energy from (76:01 - 76:05)
your hand directly and (76:03 - 76:08)
and puts it onto your bench (76:05 - 76:12)
in in more than once uh fire decks (76:08 - 76:13)
usually discard energies but unlike (76:12 - 76:15)
lightning decks you usually have to use (76:13 - 76:16)
supporters or trainer cards to get that (76:15 - 76:17)
energy back (76:16 - 76:20)
and and teams like this in the video (76:17 - 76:21)
game (76:20 - 76:23)
are also the same you could either have (76:21 - 76:24)
very fast (76:23 - 76:27)
teams you could have uh very like trick (76:24 - 76:28)
room focus teams you could have teams (76:27 - 76:29)
that stall (76:28 - 76:31)
you have very bulky teams very offensive (76:29 - 76:34)
teams but you have to figure out your (76:31 - 76:37)
play style and and (76:34 - 76:41)
adapt to that and then once you (76:37 - 76:42)
figure out what you like then you can (76:41 - 76:44)
build a team around that (76:42 - 76:45)
and i get it people want to use their (76:44 - 76:48)
favorite pokemon i totally understand (76:45 - 76:50)
but if you don't have that core (76:48 - 76:52)
established (76:50 - 76:53)
you can't just jump to your favorite (76:52 - 76:55)
pokemon so you might have to play with (76:53 - 76:56)
pokemon (76:55 - 76:59)
that are established in the meta for a (76:56 - 77:00)
reason like these pokemon are good (76:59 - 77:02)
because of xyz (77:00 - 77:03)
understand why those pokemon are good (77:02 - 77:06)
because of xyz and once you have that (77:03 - 77:07)
foundation built (77:06 - 77:09)
then you can start it to experiment a (77:07 - 77:10)
little bit more and (77:09 - 77:13)
maybe take five meta pokemon and then (77:10 - 77:15)
one of your favorite pokemon and then (77:13 - 77:17)
once that seems to be working for you (77:15 - 77:18)
maybe you can take four meta pokemon and (77:17 - 77:20)
two of your favorite pokemon (77:18 - 77:23)
you can't just go like i spent three (77:20 - 77:24)
weeks six of my favorite pokemon (77:23 - 77:26)
okay now i'm just losing non-stop well (77:24 - 77:27)
this isn't fun because no one likes to (77:26 - 77:28)
lose (77:27 - 77:31)
i don't hate losing when there's a bald (77:28 - 77:33)
guy shirt at the end (77:31 - 77:39)
there you go uh will pokemon of the week (77:33 - 77:41)
all right last week's pokemon of the (77:39 - 77:43)
week boy oh boy (77:41 - 77:47)
i got some complaints (77:43 - 77:50)
uh let's see here we go (77:47 - 77:53)
because a lot of people didn't listen to (77:50 - 77:55)
the first paragraph (77:53 - 77:58)
in which i referenced the team of twitch (77:55 - 78:00)
plays pokemon and i made fun of steve (77:58 - 78:01)
because (78:00 - 78:02)
he thinks people still care about (78:01 - 78:04)
illuminate and that omanite was (78:02 - 78:05)
important which we all know (78:04 - 78:08)
is not true oh when it's a cutie um (78:05 - 78:09)
whatever (78:08 - 78:11)
uh and then in the second paragraph i (78:09 - 78:12)
mentioned (78:11 - 78:15)
pokemon evolutions in kanto where it (78:12 - 78:17)
really seems like they were scrambled as (78:15 - 78:18)
in (78:17 - 78:21)
uh dratini going (78:18 - 78:23)
and turning into dragonite versus (78:21 - 78:25)
gyarados which obviously (78:23 - 78:28)
that's what it was intended to do and (78:25 - 78:30)
then i also indicated (78:28 - 78:31)
that if you remembered the previous (78:30 - 78:33)
week's pokemon (78:31 - 78:36)
which was weedle that you'd be able to (78:33 - 78:37)
have a clue (78:36 - 78:41)
towards this week's pokemon greg (78:37 - 78:45)
since you will know the answer what is (78:41 - 78:50)
what is the pokemon of the week it's (78:45 - 78:50)
shogun it's venomoth (78:51 - 78:57)
venomoth shell gone is not was not in (78:54 - 78:59)
twitch plays pokemon (78:57 - 79:02)
in my heart it was well your (78:59 - 79:05)
heart is a disturbing disturbing (79:02 - 79:06)
location (79:05 - 79:08)
uh i remember venomoth's name in twitch (79:06 - 79:10)
plays pokemon (79:08 - 79:13)
which was atv all terrain vehicle (79:10 - 79:14)
correct (79:13 - 79:17)
and i remember i remember i was there (79:14 - 79:18)
live (79:17 - 79:21)
oh gosh i love live content so much i (79:18 - 79:22)
was there (79:21 - 79:25)
i was there i do i really do it's it's (79:22 - 79:27)
like it's why i actually like wrestling (79:25 - 79:28)
i like (79:27 - 79:30)
that it's live i have zero interest once (79:28 - 79:31)
it's not live (79:30 - 79:37)
anymore i remember the (79:31 - 79:40)
the venomoth versus lance (79:37 - 79:40)
fight and everyone was like it's over (79:41 - 79:46)
and venom moth was able to beat the (79:44 - 79:49)
dragonite oh it was so good it was (79:46 - 79:53)
perfect content it was incredible (79:49 - 79:54)
i will never forget that there's no such (79:53 - 79:56)
thing as perfect content (79:54 - 79:59)
venomoth versus dragonite was perfect (79:56 - 80:00)
content (79:59 - 80:04)
i want to see for the 25th anniversary (80:00 - 80:06)
somebody do an anime style battle of the (80:04 - 80:07)
venomoth (80:06 - 80:10)
battle from twitch plays pokemon (80:07 - 80:12)
all right this is what i want for my 25 (80:10 - 80:14)
year old and (80:12 - 80:16)
to explain to the folks who didn't quite (80:14 - 80:17)
pick up on it (80:16 - 80:20)
venonat has butter free eyes (80:17 - 80:24)
yeah caterpie and (80:20 - 80:27)
metapod have venomoth eyes (80:24 - 80:30)
venonat has butter free antenna (80:27 - 80:32)
which venomoth does not have antenna at (80:30 - 80:34)
all well yes not that same kind (80:32 - 80:37)
at least so obviously (80:34 - 80:39)
somebody must have just like there must (80:37 - 80:41)
have been like a spreadsheet of like (80:39 - 80:42)
here's all the evolutions and then (80:41 - 80:44)
somebody accidentally like inserted (80:42 - 80:46)
another cell just shipped everything (80:44 - 80:48)
down or something i don't know why they (80:46 - 80:49)
were copy pasting too (80:48 - 80:52)
quick ah i know how they love to copy (80:49 - 80:53)
and paste (80:52 - 80:56)
bad the shuffle icon they really messed (80:53 - 80:58)
up venom off here (80:56 - 81:01)
oh yeah it's it is bad (80:58 - 81:04)
how do they do this i (81:01 - 81:06)
don't even understand how that's (81:04 - 81:07)
supposed to represent a venomoth besides (81:06 - 81:08)
the eye that might be (81:07 - 81:11)
the worst color we need a podcast where (81:08 - 81:12)
we rank (81:11 - 81:15)
all the shuffle icons right now benefits (81:12 - 81:17)
on the bottom of this podcast (81:15 - 81:20)
we promise people a quarterly ranking (81:17 - 81:21)
system uh (81:20 - 81:23)
we got to hit it well we're starting (81:21 - 81:25)
today venomoth on the bottom of pokemon (81:23 - 81:27)
shuffle icons (81:25 - 81:28)
i'm sure there's worse i'm sure there's (81:27 - 81:30)
venom moth is (81:28 - 81:33)
also bad in rumble rush like (81:30 - 81:37)
they just do it dirty oh yeah (81:33 - 81:41)
it is just sad the only (81:37 - 81:43)
one that comes close to being decent is (81:41 - 81:44)
the mystery dungeon one (81:43 - 81:46)
and we all know mystery dungeon's a (81:44 - 81:47)
garbage series (81:46 - 81:50)
you have never agreed more look at the (81:47 - 81:51)
original (81:50 - 81:54)
pokemon trose one up at the top (81:51 - 81:57)
yeah that was like way better no it's (81:54 - 81:58)
not (81:57 - 82:00)
the original pokemon jose one it's the (81:58 - 82:01)
same as the (82:00 - 82:03)
battle trojan shuffle it's just smaller (82:01 - 82:04)
moving (82:03 - 82:08)
peaked in pokemon pinball (82:04 - 82:12)
maybe ah venomoth is a good shiny (82:08 - 82:14)
i really like really good in let's go (82:12 - 82:15)
pikachu let's go eevee really really (82:14 - 82:16)
good (82:15 - 82:18)
that may be my next shiny hunt yeah it's (82:16 - 82:20)
it is (82:18 - 82:23)
so good although do you notice how like (82:20 - 82:25)
once they got uh into x and y (82:23 - 82:29)
they dropped the having the thorax be (82:25 - 82:30)
like a nice brown (82:29 - 82:33)
yeah and it's just kind of gray now that (82:30 - 82:35)
pokemon company always changing the (82:33 - 82:37)
colors on us (82:35 - 82:38)
they still can't figure out what color (82:37 - 82:39)
gligar is (82:38 - 82:42)
[Laughter] (82:39 - 82:45)
slygar the ever-changing color what's uh (82:42 - 82:46)
what's next week (82:45 - 82:49)
all right because i got complaints (82:46 - 82:51)
that people had a hard time solving (82:49 - 82:53)
pokemon of the week because (82:51 - 82:57)
it they uh the the clues were too long (82:53 - 83:00)
and they lost track as i went on i made (82:57 - 83:01)
this the longest clues ever (83:00 - 83:04)
here we go some (83:01 - 83:07)
internet resources of dubious quality (83:04 - 83:08)
claim that the gen (83:07 - 83:11)
4 and gen 7 games are tied for the (83:08 - 83:12)
number of mythical pokemon (83:11 - 83:14)
that were made available as part of (83:12 - 83:16)
their games (83:14 - 83:17)
while i hate the pointless and quite (83:16 - 83:19)
arbitrary debates concerning mythical (83:17 - 83:21)
versus legendary pokemon (83:19 - 83:23)
all of the pokemon being considered for (83:21 - 83:25)
these purposes (83:23 - 83:27)
were only available through a unique (83:25 - 83:29)
distribution method (83:27 - 83:32)
the gen 4 games provided access to (83:29 - 83:35)
vienne manafi dark rye shaymin (83:32 - 83:38)
and arceus five pokemon two of which (83:35 - 83:41)
have an evolutionary relationship gen (83:38 - 83:43)
seven games have three mythical pokemon (83:41 - 83:44)
that were obtainable (83:43 - 83:46)
through traditional mystery gift (83:44 - 83:48)
distribution methods (83:46 - 83:50)
one of these was commonly believed to (83:48 - 83:52)
have been part of the kalos region (83:50 - 83:55)
this is not the pokemon of the week two (83:52 - 83:58)
of these are clearly alolan (83:55 - 84:00)
one of these is the pokemon of the week (83:58 - 84:03)
there are also two mythical pokemon in (84:00 - 84:03)
gen (84:03 - 84:06)
7 that have an evolutionary relationship (84:03 - 84:08)
neither of these is the pokemon of the (84:06 - 84:09)
week (84:08 - 84:10)
three of the five gen seven mythical (84:09 - 84:13)
pokemon are a type of which greg does (84:10 - 84:15)
not approve and frequently treats with (84:13 - 84:17)
disdain none of these (84:15 - 84:20)
is the pokemon of the week three of the (84:17 - 84:20)
gen (84:20 - 84:22)
7 mythical pokemon have been featured in (84:20 - 84:24)
movies (84:22 - 84:26)
one of these is the pokemon of the week (84:24 - 84:27)
three of the gen (84:26 - 84:29)
7 mythical pokemon share one of their (84:27 - 84:30)
types (84:29 - 84:33)
none of these is the pokemon of the week (84:30 - 84:35)
three of the gen 7 mythical pokemon are (84:33 - 84:36)
monotype (84:35 - 84:39)
one of these is the pokemon of the week (84:36 - 84:40)
three of the gen (84:39 - 84:43)
7 mythical pokemon have the letter l in (84:40 - 84:45)
their pokemon category (84:43 - 84:48)
one of these is the pokemon of the week (84:45 - 84:50)
finally and most importantly four of the (84:48 - 84:53)
gen seven mythical pokemon have names (84:50 - 84:55)
that start with the same letter (84:53 - 84:58)
none of these is the pokemon of the week (84:55 - 85:01)
there you go that's all your clues get (84:58 - 85:02)
them all together (85:01 - 85:04)
and you'll get the answer what's your (85:02 - 85:06)
chat talk (85:04 - 85:10)
