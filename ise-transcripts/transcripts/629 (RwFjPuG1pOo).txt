uh recording (0:00 - 0:03)
[Music] (0:04 - 0:14)
recording what&#39;s up everyone welcome to (0:12 - 0:15)
the (0:14 - 0:18)
629th episode of the Pokemon podcast (0:15 - 0:20)
it&#39;s super effective I&#39;m your host Steve (0:18 - 0:25)
with me is Bobby hey I uh I just figured (0:20 - 0:28)
out that my favorite adventure effect is (0:25 - 0:30)
actually the ones that come with dusk (0:28 - 0:34)
man and da wing Dawn wings necrozma I (0:30 - 0:36)
did not realize like I know it&#39;s been (0:34 - 0:38)
weeks right this is not new information (0:36 - 0:41)
but for whatever reason I was not (0:38 - 0:43)
thinking about the fact that it&#39;s like a (0:41 - 0:45)
an incense that is every minute even (0:43 - 0:46)
when you&#39;re (0:45 - 0:48)
stationary oh (0:46 - 0:51)
so yeah so like so couple things one (0:48 - 0:53)
it&#39;s got this the only like five or six (0:51 - 0:56)
species spawn off of one of them so if (0:53 - 0:58)
you&#39;re trying to hit excellent throws (0:56 - 1:01)
which I am currently for a task it&#39;s (0:58 - 1:02)
very easy because it&#39;s only like five or (1:01 - 1:04)
six species so once you get that pattern (1:02 - 1:06)
down it&#39;s easy to hit those Excellence (1:04 - 1:08)
like every time and then yeah spawns (1:06 - 1:10)
every minute so it&#39;s my new favorite (1:08 - 1:14)
adventure effect it&#39;s big brain speaking (1:10 - 1:16)
of Speaking of necrozma Chris and I did (1:14 - 1:20)
over a hundred in New York and so I was (1:16 - 1:23)
like we sure (1:20 - 1:23)
did uh Chris (1:24 - 1:29)
welcome hey how&#39;s it going I wasn&#39;t sure (1:26 - 1:31)
like oh was this the intro yes I&#39;ve I&#39;ve (1:29 - 1:34)
rated necros as well absolutely yeah uh (1:31 - 1:37)
quite quite a bit um I always forget (1:34 - 1:39)
that Adventure effects exist despite (1:37 - 1:41)
storing all of my rare candy in aalia (1:39 - 1:44)
thinking I&#39;ll use this later it&#39;s just a (1:41 - 1:47)
problem for future Chris I (1:44 - 1:50)
guess Chris for the listeners who don&#39;t (1:47 - 1:54)
know who you are just uh feel free to oh (1:50 - 1:57)
yeah inform them sure sure sure sure uh (1:54 - 2:00)

just a phase (2:23 - 2:28)
mom uh well we have a show for you guys (2:24 - 2:32)
actually quite a bit of Pokemon news (2:28 - 2:35)
which makes it really interesting that (2:32 - 2:37)
there&#39;s all this little news this week (2:35 - 2:40)
which we will be covering uh but they&#39;re (2:37 - 2:42)
well we&#39;re recording this on the 4th (2:40 - 2:45)
this will come out on the 5th and for (2:42 - 2:49)
the last three years there was a Pokemon (2:45 - 2:53)
present before worlds during August uh (2:49 - 2:55)
one of them being like literally like (2:53 - 2:56)
three days before (2:55 - 3:00)
worlds but (2:56 - 3:00)
maybe when this goes up they&#39;ll be like (3:01 - 3:05)
hey we have a Pokemon presents I don&#39;t (3:03 - 3:07)
know what they would talk about since (3:05 - 3:10)
they have just kind of talked about (3:07 - 3:12)
everything so far and when you&#39;re (3:10 - 3:15)
listening to this episode think oh this (3:12 - 3:18)
all could have been in a present and (3:15 - 3:20)
that would have been like a nice (3:18 - 3:25)
package but that&#39;s not happening so I (3:20 - 3:27)
unsure well maybe it is happening but we (3:25 - 3:30)
just don&#39;t know as of Sunday morning it (3:27 - 3:34)
could happen mhm it could happen um (3:30 - 3:38)
let&#39;s start off with our Pokemon sleep (3:34 - 3:42)
news which is we had the first big 1.1 (3:38 - 3:46)
update which brought ribbons to the (3:42 - 3:50)
game uh and there was also a Nerf I (3:46 - 3:52)
don&#39;t I okay so it was my birthday this (3:50 - 3:54)
last week and I was live all week and I (3:52 - 3:57)
can&#39;t remember what I have talked about (3:54 - 3:59)
on a podcast or on a twitch stream at (3:57 - 4:02)
this point (3:59 - 4:02)
so I&#39;m not sure we talked about this the (4:02 - 4:07)
the update went live um you can go from (4:04 - 4:10)
research rank 55 to 60 Pokemon level 55 (4:07 - 4:12)
to 60 the only thing you&#39;re getting when (4:10 - 4:15)
your Pokemon hit 60 is that last (4:12 - 4:17)
ingredient unlock on a (4:15 - 4:21)
Pokemon I did uh my Wiggly tff was at 55 (4:17 - 4:23)
I went to see how much it would cost to (4:21 - 4:28)
get it to 60 only like (4:23 - 4:30)
350,000 dream shards (4:28 - 4:37)
and like 800 candy uh it&#39;s a lot yeah (4:30 - 4:39)
the thing you should do especially if (4:37 - 4:41)
you are a free-to-play player or you do (4:39 - 4:44)
spend a little bit of money is the bag (4:41 - 4:46)
ingredient pocket how much like (4:44 - 4:49)
mushrooms eggs apples you can hold uh (4:46 - 4:52)
was increased from 600 to 700 so kind of (4:49 - 4:55)
just like Pokemon go if if (4:52 - 4:58)
you were like I want to invest in (4:55 - 5:00)
something that&#39;s not going to disappear (4:58 - 5:02)
like a raid pass or an incense or an (5:00 - 5:05)
incubator because those are temporary uh (5:02 - 5:07)
upgrading your storage is very good but (5:05 - 5:10)
unlike Pokemon go you don&#39;t need to hold (5:07 - 5:12)
a lot of (5:10 - 5:15)
Pokemon in this game you need to hold a (5:12 - 5:18)
lot of mushrooms and apples and Slowpoke (5:15 - 5:21)
tail that&#39;s (5:18 - 5:23)
right I mean honestly the the part of (5:21 - 5:25)
this that I&#39;m most excited about is the (5:23 - 5:27)
is the research rank up because having (5:25 - 5:32)
sat at 55 for like a month or so now uh (5:27 - 5:34)
it&#39;s just exciting to finally get my (5:32 - 5:36)
sleep research experience applied (5:34 - 5:38)
towards something instead of just like (5:36 - 5:39)
converted to dream shards that I&#39;m not (5:38 - 5:41)
really using very (5:39 - 5:43)
well you are you are if you want to (5:41 - 5:45)
bring that Wiggly tough up to level 60 I (5:43 - 5:47)
suppose so yeah I did instantly look at (5:45 - 5:49)
my tyion like how much no I&#39;m not going (5:47 - 5:51)
to do this too I I also shied away from (5:49 - 5:54)
it uh but but as as a very casual yet (5:51 - 5:57)
dedicated Pokemon sleeper uh that that (5:54 - 6:01)
was the most exciting bit for sure (5:57 - 6:04)
yeah I think uh as someone who isn&#39;t at (6:01 - 6:06)
rank 55 or doesn&#39;t have any Pokemon near (6:04 - 6:10)
level 55 yet um the I do like the the (6:06 - 6:15)
skills specialty and how it Banks and so (6:10 - 6:16)
plenty of times I&#39;ll open it and then (6:15 - 6:18)
they&#39;ll be it&#39;ll get hit with like two (6:16 - 6:20)
like Wiggly tough will you know hit the (6:18 - 6:23)
skill twice or you know flare on add to (6:20 - 6:25)
the pot twice in a row or something like (6:23 - 6:27)
that so I thought that was a a great uh (6:25 - 6:30)
Improvement that they made to it as well (6:27 - 6:33)
they also did not say this before the (6:30 - 6:36)
update but the special Pikachu that you (6:33 - 6:39)
get from the Plus+ you could uh level (6:36 - 6:44)
him up even more uh so he his (6:39 - 6:46)
level uh oh I was going to say I don&#39;t (6:44 - 6:47)
know if it&#39;s a boy or girl it is a boy (6:46 - 6:49)
because you could just tell him a face (6:47 - 6:53)
of its tail his his his level is 18 or (6:49 - 6:56)
was 18 it can now go up to 20 and it (6:53 - 6:59)
will once you hit 19 it will unlock (6:56 - 7:01)
honey so that Pikachu was normally (6:59 - 7:04)
getting you apples and cacao and now it (7:01 - 7:07)
can get you honey on top of (7:04 - 7:11)
that and there is a special Pikachu (7:07 - 7:14)
profile icon if you have the Plus+ which (7:11 - 7:15)
I haven&#39;t seen anyone on my friends list (7:14 - 7:17)
switch to but I think that&#39;s because (7:15 - 7:19)
everyone just likes their Shiny Pokemon (7:17 - 7:20)
to (7:19 - 7:25)
flex yes yeah that&#39;s the answer oh (7:20 - 7:28)
yeah uh Bobby you can now put Pokemon (7:25 - 7:31)
sleep on your m M4 iPad and you can put (7:28 - 7:34)
your M4 iPad under your pillow are are (7:31 - 7:36)
you doing that is that something you&#39;re (7:34 - 7:38)
interested in that seems like a terrible (7:36 - 7:41)
terrible idea but you can do it don&#39;t do (7:38 - 7:43)
it don&#39;t put your iPad do not sleep with (7:41 - 7:45)
your iPad under your pillow please do (7:43 - 7:47)
not do that what we need is a like a a (7:45 - 7:51)
special case for it that doubles as a (7:47 - 7:53)
pillow that would be awesome that would (7:51 - 7:55)
be amazing that&#39;s a really good (7:53 - 7:57)
marketing thing like put your slide your (7:55 - 8:00)
iPad into your pillow at this special (7:57 - 8:02)
pillow at night the Pok√©mon Sleep (8:00 - 8:05)
Pillow you could sell different pillow (8:02 - 8:07)
cases for said (8:05 - 8:11)
pillow wow perfect this is great these (8:07 - 8:13)
ideas are (8:11 - 8:16)
free I think I wonder I wonder okay (8:13 - 8:18)
we&#39;re making fun of the the tablet (8:16 - 8:20)
support that they added randomly a year (8:18 - 8:23)
into this game but I have met a ton of (8:20 - 8:25)
people that are like I don&#39;t want to (8:23 - 8:27)
leave my (8:25 - 8:32)
phone on mhm all night which (8:27 - 8:36)
understandable I I I don&#39;t think I would (8:32 - 8:38)
be playing this game every single day (8:36 - 8:41)
and love this game as much if it was so (8:38 - 8:44)
phone he dependent like I like the plus (8:41 - 8:47)
the Plus+ is like really what sells me (8:44 - 8:48)
but some people don&#39;t want to go out and (8:47 - 8:50)
spend $65 I don&#39;t even know how much it (8:48 - 8:52)
is 50 bucks 60 bucks 60 bucks or (8:50 - 8:54)
something it&#39;s expensive yeah it&#39;s (8:52 - 8:56)
definitely uh (8:54 - 9:00)
expensive but but I guess my I&#39;m (8:56 - 9:03)
thinking now how many people have like (9:00 - 9:05)
an old tablet that they&#39;re not really (9:03 - 9:08)
doing anything with not like a huge like (9:05 - 9:11)
11in iPad but maybe like an old iPad (9:08 - 9:13)
Mini or an old Android tablet or even an (9:11 - 9:15)
old phone that they could put that game (9:13 - 9:17)
on and kind of make it a dedicated go (9:15 - 9:20)
Plus+ so their phone can actually sit (9:17 - 9:23)
where they want it to sit and charge (9:20 - 9:26)
or it&#39;s an option I guess or maybe like (9:23 - 9:29)
parents are like H I don&#39;t know my kid (9:26 - 9:32)
doesn&#39;t have a phone but they have a (9:29 - 9:34)
iPad (9:32 - 9:36)
Mini I think that I think that second (9:34 - 9:38)
one is definitely like a much more (9:36 - 9:42)
popular use case uh that like somebody (9:38 - 9:44)
that doesn&#39;t have a phone the iPad (9:42 - 9:45)
support is much (9:44 - 9:49)
more is much more helpful in that case (9:45 - 9:53)
yeah I I think I I always thought that (9:49 - 9:55)
the phone thing was weird so I&#39;m not (9:53 - 9:57)
someone who ever used a sleep tracker (9:55 - 10:00)
before so I I was I&#39;m not very like up (9:57 - 10:03)
on how they typically work but I always (10:00 - 10:05)
thought it was odd that you do have to (10:03 - 10:09)
have your phone on and the app has to be (10:05 - 10:10)
open too (10:09 - 10:14)
right technically yes so just feels (10:10 - 10:17)
weird to do that and then have it like (10:14 - 10:20)
sitting all night like that like your (10:17 - 10:22)
screen shuts off (10:20 - 10:24)
technically yeah (10:22 - 10:27)
but wait what so so the so when the app (10:24 - 10:30)
is open yeah think of it think of it (10:27 - 10:35)
like uh Google Maps yeah okay where like (10:30 - 10:36)
it can like the screen can still lock (10:35 - 10:38)
and still go into standby but like if (10:36 - 10:40)
you were to GL if you were to glance at (10:38 - 10:43)
it it would show you the upcoming route (10:40 - 10:45)
yeah like Pokemon sleep kind of does (10:43 - 10:49)
that mhm so the problem (10:45 - 10:51)
with it being on your (10:49 - 10:54)
phone is it it is Pokemon sleep thinks (10:51 - 10:57)
it&#39;s like the most powerful app in the (10:54 - 10:59)
world and it needs to control everything (10:57 - 11:00)
so like once you start your sleep (10:59 - 11:03)
section it&#39;s like you don&#39;t get to look (11:00 - 11:05)
at Tik Tok cuz we&#39;re controlling the (11:03 - 11:06)
sound you don&#39;t get to listen to your (11:05 - 11:08)
podcast anymore because we&#39;re (11:06 - 11:09)
controlling the sound you don&#39;t get to (11:08 - 11:12)
do this right so you can have the app (11:09 - 11:14)
open and you can like leave it and go to (11:12 - 11:16)
like Twitter or threads for a second but (11:14 - 11:19)
you have to go back to it otherwise it (11:16 - 11:22)
will end session so it it needs to (11:19 - 11:24)
continue to be running which is kind of (11:22 - 11:27)
annoying especially if you&#39;re like (11:24 - 11:30)
yeah I don&#39;t know yeah (11:27 - 11:32)
I yeah that makes sense it&#39;s got to be (11:30 - 11:35)
face down too right in order for it to (11:32 - 11:36)
to be tracking or or can you leave it (11:35 - 11:39)
face up I think you can leave a face up (11:36 - 11:40)
but because the sensor at least on the (11:39 - 11:43)
iPhone the sensors will determine (11:40 - 11:44)
whether to like shut the screen off (11:43 - 11:46)
completely yeah right because I I (11:44 - 11:49)
remember using like old sleep tracking (11:46 - 11:51)
apps like on you know Generations ago on (11:49 - 11:53)
different phones and stuff and I always (11:51 - 11:55)
had to leave them face down because (11:53 - 11:56)
something about the screen was helping (11:55 - 11:58)
them sense vibrations or something like (11:56 - 12:00)
that I don&#39;t know (11:58 - 12:03)
um I&#39;m sure we&#39;re past that um but yeah (12:00 - 12:05)
do do you still have to leave it uh (12:03 - 12:08)
plugged in too it recommends you leaving (12:05 - 12:11)
a plugged in yes that&#39;s gosh that freaks (12:08 - 12:13)
me out destroy your battery otherwise (12:11 - 12:15)
wouldn&#39;t it because it&#39;s like still (12:13 - 12:18)
running it&#39;s still doing I would hope (12:15 - 12:19)
that Pokemon sleep in an eight hour (12:18 - 12:22)
session doesn&#39;t like eat through like (12:19 - 12:25)
50% of your battery what what possibly (12:22 - 12:28)
could it be trying to compute I you (12:25 - 12:30)
never know I mean I mean Pokemon sleep (12:28 - 12:32)
definitely or Pokemon go definitely rips (12:30 - 12:34)
through your battery that&#39;s oh yeah oh (12:32 - 12:37)
yeah yeah yeah so well to your point (12:34 - 12:39)
with like Pokemon sleep wanting to (12:37 - 12:40)
control everything I think I&#39;ve (12:39 - 12:42)
mentioned this before but like it&#39;s (12:40 - 12:44)
really annoying to like open Pokemon (12:42 - 12:48)
sleep when you are um like using another (12:44 - 12:51)
app with like audio or like I&#39;ll be (12:48 - 12:53)
watching a movie and have my headphones (12:51 - 12:54)
like I have a Roku TV so I&#39;ll put my (12:53 - 12:56)
headphones on and then I can just listen (12:54 - 12:58)
to the movie on my TV through my (12:56 - 13:00)
headphones but when Pokemon sleep opens (12:58 - 13:03)
if I forget it everything goes like nuts (13:00 - 13:07)
like the the TV it like it like flickers (13:03 - 13:09)
and then pauses and then all of a sudden (13:07 - 13:11)
I&#39;m getting Pokemon sleep music whatever (13:09 - 13:14)
I was watching is just completely stops (13:11 - 13:18)
and it&#39;s awful like I I don&#39;t understand (13:14 - 13:20)
it&#39;s like inconsistent too I have the (13:18 - 13:21)
same problem I listen to podcasts or I (13:20 - 13:23)
like hook it onto my car or whatever (13:21 - 13:25)
right and it&#39;ll take over for the radio (13:23 - 13:27)
and then I&#39;ll open up Pokemon sleep like (13:25 - 13:28)
I got to feed lunch before I put on my (13:27 - 13:31)
driveway and then I I go to do that and (13:28 - 13:33)
then sometimes the podcast comes back on (13:31 - 13:35)
sometimes it it crashes the app my my (13:33 - 13:37)
Spotify app like I don&#39;t know what&#39;s (13:35 - 13:40)
going on it is it&#39;s doing something it&#39;s (13:37 - 13:43)
thinking hard it&#39;s thinking real (13:40 - 13:48)
hard I have used a couple sleep trackers (13:43 - 13:50)
other than sleep and I think obviously (13:48 - 13:52)
sleep is the one I&#39;m stuck with the most (13:50 - 13:54)
it it just charged me as of yesterday (13:52 - 13:57)
another $50 so I did the $50 for the six (13:54 - 14:01)
months the $50 for the the the the next (13:57 - 14:03)
six months that was the year and then I (14:01 - 14:07)
just got the $50 charge yesterday so I&#39;m (14:03 - 14:11)
$150 in this game just subscription wise (14:07 - 14:13)
yeah so I guess I like it and we talk (14:11 - 14:16)
about this app every single week at this (14:13 - 14:19)
point uh I the the only other sleep app (14:16 - 14:22)
I stuck with was 14 years ago I did a (14:19 - 14:25)
Kickstarter for an app uh for a bracelet (14:22 - 14:27)
called the Wake (14:25 - 14:29)
mate no one has probably ever heard of (14:27 - 14:31)
this but uh-uh instead of being like a (14:29 - 14:34)
ring or a watch it was uh it was almost (14:31 - 14:36)
like a scrunchie and you would you would (14:34 - 14:39)
put it on your on your arm like before (14:36 - 14:41)
below your elbow and I don&#39;t like (14:39 - 14:43)
sleeping with jewelry on at all I don&#39;t (14:41 - 14:44)
I also think you&#39;re not supposed to (14:43 - 14:46)
technically sleep with your like rings (14:44 - 14:48)
on and stuff like that because like your (14:46 - 14:51)
body can heat them up and I don&#39;t know (14:48 - 14:52)
people sleep with their Rings all the (14:51 - 14:53)
time I don&#39;t like sleeping with my rings (14:52 - 14:55)
I take them off (14:53 - 14:59)
um but uh that uh after using that for (14:55 - 15:02)
like two two months and I guess liking (14:59 - 15:04)
it uh there they had to send a huge (15:02 - 15:07)
Kickstarter email being like stop using (15:04 - 15:09)
immediately cuz one of them caught on (15:07 - 15:13)
fire during somebody&#39;s sleep session oh (15:09 - 15:16)
no oh gosh so there was like a recall (15:13 - 15:18)
and they said they were going to do (15:16 - 15:20)
something about it and don&#39;t use it (15:18 - 15:23)
anymore and that company no longer (15:20 - 15:27)
exists understandable uh at all it was (15:23 - 15:29)
also a Kickstarter under that name at (15:27 - 15:32)
least hey try it (15:29 - 15:35)
again but I know Hannah uses the aura (15:32 - 15:37)
ring I know I think will uses the aura (15:35 - 15:39)
ring I (15:37 - 15:42)
think Apple has been rumored to come out (15:39 - 15:44)
with a ring Samsung just came out with (15:42 - 15:46)
their (15:44 - 15:49)
ring I I like rings I don&#39;t want to wear (15:46 - 15:51)
a ring to bed (15:49 - 15:54)
either yeah I don&#39;t know I mean I wear a (15:51 - 15:56)
ring to bed my wedding ring but that&#39;s (15:54 - 15:58)
it like I don&#39;t wear like any health (15:56 - 16:00)
stuff I do I do wear my watch to bed (15:58 - 16:02)
though do you wear your ring in the (16:00 - 16:04)
shower yeah I wear my ring all the time (16:02 - 16:06)
okay yeah yeah there was a period of (16:04 - 16:07)
time where I didn&#39;t though I would take (16:06 - 16:10)
it off at night and then at some point I (16:07 - 16:12)
was just like okay I don&#39;t want to keep (16:10 - 16:14)
I don&#39;t want to forget like I don&#39;t want (16:12 - 16:16)
to like lose it or (16:14 - 16:18)
something um but I do wear my watch to (16:16 - 16:22)
bed uh for because I like the alarm I (16:18 - 16:24)
like it just being able to vibrate my (16:22 - 16:26)
wrist to wake me up rather than have (16:24 - 16:30)
like a loud beeping noise wake me up um (16:26 - 16:32)
so you know obviously they wouldn&#39;t want (16:30 - 16:36)
to do this because the go Plus+ is their (16:32 - 16:38)
uh accessory that they want people to (16:36 - 16:40)
buy but like they could make an Apple (16:38 - 16:43)
Watch app for Pokemon sleep would be (16:40 - 16:45)
amazing because they did have a Pokemon (16:43 - 16:49)
Go app for um the watch a long time ago (16:45 - 16:53)
and they sure did Rip man the app like (16:49 - 16:55)
it it wasn&#39;t great on like the older (16:53 - 16:58)
watches because like you know it was (16:55 - 17:00)
they&#39;re slow but the app itself was (16:58 - 17:02)
actually really nice like you could spin (17:00 - 17:04)
stops with it you could see what was (17:02 - 17:07)
nearby with the app and everything um I (17:04 - 17:08)
think you didn&#39;t the watch Auto Spin (17:07 - 17:12)
stops or am I misremembering I uh I (17:08 - 17:14)
thought it did did it I don&#39;t I remember (17:12 - 17:16)
you could definitely spin them like you (17:14 - 17:17)
could spin them on your watch but I (17:16 - 17:20)
don&#39;t remember if it yeah I think I (17:17 - 17:23)
think you could do both where you could (17:20 - 17:24)
yeah cuz I remember walking around a (17:23 - 17:26)
mall using (17:24 - 17:30)
it mhm and I feel like it was Auto Spin (17:26 - 17:33)
and that was also like what 7 years ago (17:30 - 17:36)
yeah this was this was pre the original (17:33 - 17:39)
plus right and and then so so they (17:36 - 17:40)
stripped that functionality to sell the (17:39 - 17:44)
plus I think maybe the plus was out but (17:40 - 17:47)
buy it it was like sold out yeah right (17:44 - 17:49)
right yeah and I feel like once it was (17:47 - 17:52)
very easy to buy the plus it was also (17:49 - 17:53)
around the time where they&#39;re like well (17:52 - 17:56)
we&#39;re discontinuing this yeah yeah (17:53 - 17:57)
probably I mean cuz they had that (17:56 - 17:59)
partnership with apple because that (17:57 - 18:01)
never came to Android like to any (17:59 - 18:03)
Android stuff the watch part of it the (18:01 - 18:05)
watch part it was only an apple or an (18:03 - 18:08)
iOS thing so um or a watch OS thing I (18:05 - 18:13)
guess um so anyways sleep you should (18:08 - 18:15)
make it an app for the watch that would (18:13 - 18:18)
be I think even if they didn&#39;t do a (18:15 - 18:19)
watch app I feel like people just wanted (18:18 - 18:23)
to work with like uh health kit on Apple (18:19 - 18:27)
or Google is it what Google fit (18:23 - 18:30)
on Android Google gole health or (18:27 - 18:33)
something yeah health I don&#39;t know (18:30 - 18:35)
whatever is whatever&#39;s proprietary to (18:33 - 18:38)
whatever Android phones are a whole (18:35 - 18:40)
different yeah (18:38 - 18:40)
something uh okay here&#39;s here&#39;s here&#39;s (18:41 - 18:47)
the Nerf let me see if I can find it (18:44 - 18:50)
they don&#39;t even call it a Nerf um oh (18:47 - 18:52)
here it is it says uh adjustment to the (18:50 - 18:54)
game function when you edit your team (18:52 - 18:56)
after this adjustment whenever you (18:54 - 18:59)
change a Pokemon uh when whenever you (18:56 - 19:01)
change which Pokemon are on your team (18:59 - 19:04)
even if you only change one any banked (19:01 - 19:07)
main skills that are ready to use for (19:04 - 19:10)
any of the Pokemon on your team will be (19:07 - 19:12)
cancelled we are making this adjustment (19:10 - 19:14)
to prepare for a wide variety of main (19:12 - 19:16)
skills we plan to implement in the (19:14 - 19:19)
future so cool thing we know they&#39;re (19:16 - 19:21)
going to come up with more new main (19:19 - 19:23)
skills this is a bad (19:21 - 19:26)
thing uh this is maybe the first biggest (19:23 - 19:28)
Nerf they have done to this game now (19:26 - 19:30)
you&#39;re probably like Steve I don&#39;t even (19:28 - 19:32)
know what that means I&#39;m still on Green (19:30 - 19:34)
Grass and all I have is a Metapod uh let (19:32 - 19:36)
me explain what this means uh it really (19:34 - 19:38)
only applies to a couple (19:36 - 19:42)
Pokemon but uh some hardcore players not (19:38 - 19:44)
all hardcore players everyone plays (19:42 - 19:48)
slightly differently but it&#39;s it&#39;s at (19:44 - 19:50)
least for the hardcore players a little (19:48 - 19:52)
bit common to switch your teams out (19:50 - 19:54)
frequently because also you also just (19:52 - 19:56)
have a lot of Pokemon and they need to (19:54 - 19:58)
do other stuff so you might see people (19:56 - 19:59)
switch out their teams (19:58 - 20:03)
to like I need corn so I&#39;m going to (19:59 - 20:05)
switch in my beware that only gets corn (20:03 - 20:06)
I&#39;m going to run my beware for maybe (20:05 - 20:08)
five or six hours I&#39;m completely stocked (20:06 - 20:10)
up on corn for the next couple days so (20:08 - 20:11)
now I&#39;m going to switch back to like a (20:10 - 20:14)
Dragonite for something else the there (20:11 - 20:16)
there is uh we talked about the Sleep (20:14 - 20:18)
meta last time there is a meta right now (20:16 - 20:21)
the meta currently is getting a Pokemon (20:18 - 20:24)
that has all three of the same (20:21 - 20:26)
ingredients so you can do what I just (20:24 - 20:29)
said you can do like uh I need sausage (20:26 - 20:31)
if I bring in my tyion that&#39;s nothing (20:29 - 20:33)
but sausage I&#39;m guaranteed to get (20:31 - 20:35)
sausage it gets a lot of sausage we got (20:33 - 20:38)
we now have sausage like it&#39;s here but (20:35 - 20:40)
now I don&#39;t need any more sausage so I (20:38 - 20:42)
can switch out to something else right (20:40 - 20:45)
um (20:42 - 20:48)
and what I would do or what other people (20:45 - 20:49)
would do is they would also switch their (20:48 - 20:52)
entire team to like Berry finders at (20:49 - 20:54)
night before they go to bed because you (20:52 - 20:56)
can get the berries overnight you can (20:54 - 20:58)
get the sneaky snacking you you&#39;re not (20:56 - 21:00)
going to spend any ingredients overnight (20:58 - 21:02)
so and you might be capped at Max (21:00 - 21:03)
ingredients so there&#39;s no point in (21:02 - 21:05)
getting more ingredients when you&#39;re (21:03 - 21:06)
already capped so you switch to a bunch (21:05 - 21:07)
of berry people you have those run (21:06 - 21:09)
overnight in the morning then you switch (21:07 - 21:11)
back to ingredients through for (21:09 - 21:12)
throughout the day there&#39;s like a lot of (21:11 - 21:15)
things you can do to do that but when (21:12 - 21:18)
you&#39;re switching you might like activate (21:15 - 21:21)
Meganium charge power okay it&#39;s (21:18 - 21:23)
activated okay power is used I can (21:21 - 21:26)
switch them out to like an altario or a (21:23 - 21:29)
tyion or something else but now when you (21:26 - 21:31)
everyone&#39;s ability goes away which is is (21:29 - 21:33)
bad but in the morning when I would (21:31 - 21:35)
switch what I would do is I would switch (21:33 - 21:37)
the berry person I would switch whatever (21:35 - 21:39)
to get my ingredients back then I would (21:37 - 21:42)
feed Snorlax and then I would proc (21:39 - 21:45)
wigglytuff&#39;s ability because Wiggly Tuff (21:42 - 21:49)
would then give bonus charge strength to (21:45 - 21:52)
those Pokemon so Snorlax can only get (21:49 - 21:56)
you up to like a 100 so if you&#39;re at 100 (21:52 - 21:58)
and you feed lunch you&#39;re still going to (21:56 - 21:59)
be at 100 but if you&#39;re at 100 and you (21:58 - 22:02)
proc Wiggly now all of a sudden you&#39;re (21:59 - 22:05)
at like 112 for everyone so you don&#39;t (22:02 - 22:07)
want to proc Wiggly before you switch (22:05 - 22:09)
something because when because that (22:07 - 22:12)
Pokemon&#39;s going to the box and that and (22:09 - 22:13)
they&#39;re not going to take advantage of (22:12 - 22:16)
that boost but now you can no longer do (22:13 - 22:19)
what I just said I can&#39;t in the morning (22:16 - 22:22)
switch out my Meganium for a Blastoise (22:19 - 22:24)
and then proc wiggly so that Blastoise (22:22 - 22:27)
has like 115 116 (22:24 - 22:30)
HP because as soon as I switch the main (22:27 - 22:32)
skills are gone for (22:30 - 22:36)
everyone which is a Nerf but also like (22:32 - 22:38)
3% of people listening to this podcast (22:36 - 22:39)
was like I used to do that and everyone (22:38 - 22:43)
else is like oh that was that&#39;s really (22:39 - 22:45)
complicated I don&#39;t do that I&#39;m in that (22:43 - 22:47)
camp that that is that is why I never (22:45 - 22:49)
did this because I knew something like (22:47 - 22:53)
this would happen and uh yeah yeah so (22:49 - 22:55)
great (22:53 - 22:59)
um that is a strategy it is kind of cool (22:55 - 23:01)
though and it&#39;s like kind of it when you (22:59 - 23:03)
think about it you&#39;re like oh okay yeah (23:01 - 23:06)
maximizing my team yeah (23:03 - 23:08)
I I (23:06 - 23:13)
guess it still kind of works in a (23:08 - 23:16)
proactive way because you could trigger (23:13 - 23:19)
the skill Now you kind of have to right (23:16 - 23:20)
before you switch because you&#39;re just (23:19 - 23:23)
wasting it if you don&#39;t so at least (23:20 - 23:25)
those Pokemon will have a ton of energy (23:23 - 23:29)
when they come back in that&#39;s true yes (23:25 - 23:31)
you if you have like a Blastoise with (23:29 - 23:33)
like 118% (23:31 - 23:36)
energy and you put them back in uh you (23:33 - 23:39)
put them in your storage he holds on he (23:36 - 23:41)
holds on to that right right it&#39;s not (23:39 - 23:44)
like the worst there&#39;s been worst Nerfs (23:41 - 23:47)
in video games history like this is not (23:44 - 23:50)
the worst one yeah but I mean it does (23:47 - 23:54)
take away a a strategy that sounds like (23:50 - 23:56)
it is quite useful if you are playing (23:54 - 23:58)
the game that way so yeah that is (23:56 - 24:00)
unfortunate (23:58 - 24:02)
I don&#39;t think it completely destroys the (24:00 - 24:07)
one ingredient meta but uh and while I (24:02 - 24:08)
understand that&#39;s like the meta right (24:07 - 24:11)
now is like get a Dragonite with all uh (24:08 - 24:15)
fiery herb get a Beware with all uh corn (24:11 - 24:18)
get a mecar out with all (24:15 - 24:21)
potato I I I don&#39;t want to say I (24:18 - 24:23)
encourage you not to stick very closely (24:21 - 24:24)
to that (24:23 - 24:27)
meta but even in my video that I made my (24:24 - 24:29)
like 20 minute intro to sleep video is (24:27 - 24:31)
like things change like an update like (24:29 - 24:33)
this does change that entire Wiggly (24:31 - 24:36)
tough strategy that I just did a simple (24:33 - 24:40)
one sentence chains changes that and I (24:36 - 24:42)
also want to tell people like you might (24:40 - 24:45)
be looking for the most perfect all corn (24:42 - 24:48)
beware but you might have a really good (24:45 - 24:51)
like a minus beware it might not be like (24:48 - 24:54)
an S tier beware as somebody who has (24:51 - 24:57)
been at lapis and my lapis is at in one (24:54 - 24:59)
in one more week my lapis will be at 60% (24:57 - 25:02)
which means it will be maxed I don&#39;t (24:59 - 25:06)
have a good beware I don&#39;t have a good (25:02 - 25:08)
roals and this game has been out for a (25:06 - 25:10)
year I think lapis has been out for six (25:08 - 25:12)
months what what are you even doing (25:10 - 25:15)
Steve what are you I&#39;m just telling (25:12 - 25:18)
people that if you are very very lucky (25:15 - 25:20)
and you get this s tier Pokemon that (25:18 - 25:22)
fits the meta perfectly that&#39;s awesome (25:20 - 25:25)
but also there&#39;s just a lot of Pokemon (25:22 - 25:27)
that are just fine and are just good and (25:25 - 25:29)
you should just start using them and (25:27 - 25:31)
just powering them up because there&#39;s (25:29 - 25:32)
also going to (25:31 - 25:36)
be power creep in this game (25:32 - 25:40)
M and you might spend a whole year (25:36 - 25:42)
looking for the most perfect Doug (25:40 - 25:45)
Trio and be like finally I got the most (25:42 - 25:47)
perfect Doug Trio you know what&#39;s almost (25:45 - 25:49)
better I think actually is better than (25:47 - 25:52)
Doug Trio quack waval it&#39;s it it gets (25:49 - 25:54)
leaks better than duct Trio does so like (25:52 - 25:56)
the power creep has already existed like (25:54 - 25:58)
you could like the most perfect Wiggly (25:56 - 26:02)
tff is still outperformed by gardav War (25:58 - 26:04)
yeah I wish I had a gardav (26:02 - 26:07)
war that does that mean gavor existing (26:04 - 26:09)
means I my wigglytuff&#39;s bad no my (26:07 - 26:11)
Wigglytuff is still amazing she&#39;s great (26:09 - 26:15)
she&#39;s a queen uh but like I just want to (26:11 - 26:16)
encourage people (26:15 - 26:20)
like you don&#39;t need every Pokemon you (26:16 - 26:22)
get doesn&#39;t need to (26:20 - 26:26)
be an S tier Pokemon we see this in (26:22 - 26:28)
Pok√©mon go too where people don&#39;t want (26:26 - 26:29)
to p (26:28 - 26:32)
unless it&#39;s 100% when when actually if (26:29 - 26:35)
you run the numbers like a there&#39;s no (26:32 - 26:37)
difference between a 98 and 100% they (26:35 - 26:40)
function 100% exactly the same except (26:37 - 26:42)
for like the maybe like one situation (26:40 - 26:45)
Master league but for raids there&#39;s like (26:42 - 26:48)
no difference but people people won&#39;t (26:45 - 26:50)
power up things because it&#39;s like I need (26:48 - 26:53)
to wait until my Rayquaza is shiny and (26:50 - 26:55)
it&#39;s extra extra large and it&#39;s it&#39;s (26:53 - 26:59)
100% And it&#39;s like brother the this game (26:55 - 27:00)
has been out for eight years I don&#39;t (26:59 - 27:01)
know if that&#39;s happening for you just (27:00 - 27:05)
pick pick another Rayquaza come on (27:01 - 27:08)
like yeah I don&#39;t know it&#39;s it&#39;s the (27:05 - 27:09)
it&#39;s the way to to gate yourself from (27:08 - 27:11)
not spending all of your resources right (27:09 - 27:13)
like I keep getting 98% of this one I&#39;m (27:11 - 27:15)
waiting for the hundos I can finally (27:13 - 27:17)
spend Stardust and then you&#39;re like I&#39;m (27:15 - 27:19)
sitting on 23 million Stardust what am I (27:17 - 27:22)
doing you know so I mean I guess you (27:19 - 27:23)
have a point I I do want to say one (27:22 - 27:25)
thing though as as somebody who&#39;s just (27:23 - 27:27)
incredibly casual with my Pokemon sleep (27:25 - 27:30)
play changes like this kind of give me a (27:27 - 27:33)
little bit of relief uh for when I (27:30 - 27:35)
inevitably uh do try to dig in deeper (27:33 - 27:38)
into this game if this simplifies this (27:35 - 27:40)
this Nuance right they have to hot swap (27:38 - 27:43)
my Wiggly tff in and out uh this is good (27:40 - 27:45)
news for me on that learning curve let (27:43 - 27:46)
me let me just say I&#39;m sorry for your (27:45 - 27:48)
loss Steve (27:46 - 27:50)
but this is encouraging for me as (27:48 - 27:52)
somebody who just Auto cooks and I&#39;m (27:50 - 27:54)
like Berry finders ingredient Finders on (27:52 - 27:58)
the weekend great like I&#39;m good you know (27:54 - 28:00)
I I think the switching is also maybe (27:58 - 28:02)
slightly more discouraged too because of (28:00 - 28:06)
the ribbon stuff oh sure right because (28:02 - 28:08)
if I&#39;m only switching Berry people in at (28:06 - 28:11)
night and I&#39;m not having my ingredient (28:08 - 28:13)
people sleep then those are not getting (28:11 - 28:18)
the ribbon and the ribbon is a cool (28:13 - 28:20)
addition but also don&#39;t know what the (28:18 - 28:23)
long-term effects of said ribbon is (28:20 - 28:25)
uncertain Pokemon cuz I&#39;m sure there are (28:23 - 28:26)
some hardcore people out there that are (28:25 - 28:29)
like I don&#39;t want my Pokemon to have (28:26 - 28:32)
more of a carry limit because that might (28:29 - 28:36)
affect sneaky snacking or whatever but I (28:32 - 28:38)
I don&#39;t just there&#39;s also a point where (28:36 - 28:40)
it&#39;s like maybe you&#39;re being a little (28:38 - 28:43)
too serious with this game I you that (28:40 - 28:45)
wasn&#39;t before would you were talking (28:43 - 28:47)
about all the switching in and out like (28:45 - 28:49)
I mean I get switching in and out for (28:47 - 28:51)
things especially when you are maxing (28:49 - 28:52)
out on ingredients and it&#39;s like okay (28:51 - 28:54)
well now this is pointless because I&#39;m (28:52 - 28:57)
just going into throwaway (28:54 - 29:00)
ingredients to get more ingred like so I (28:57 - 29:01)
get it I do get switching out when you (29:00 - 29:03)
know you&#39;ve gotten to that point and (29:01 - 29:04)
then you get your Berry finders and (29:03 - 29:08)
things like that uh however when I came (29:04 - 29:10)
into this game I understood it as push (29:08 - 29:12)
this button and then wake up in the (29:10 - 29:14)
morning and then yay you get a Pokemon (29:12 - 29:18)
and it might be shiny and that&#39;s cool uh (29:14 - 29:20)
there is so much more to this game it (29:18 - 29:22)
like continues to just show how many (29:20 - 29:25)
layers there are which I think is a (29:22 - 29:28)
really good thing because you there so (29:25 - 29:32)
many ways to play the game and just and (29:28 - 29:34)
there&#39;s there&#39;s so many ways to play the (29:32 - 29:37)
game and everybody can play exactly how (29:34 - 29:38)
they want to play because there&#39;s (29:37 - 29:40)
actually no competition between each (29:38 - 29:43)
other right like within the game (29:40 - 29:44)
obviously people make competition out of (29:43 - 29:47)
everything but uh you&#39;re not competing (29:44 - 29:50)
with others so you can play the game (29:47 - 29:52)
exactly how you want to and not feel (29:50 - 29:55)
like oh I&#39;m not as good as this person (29:52 - 29:57)
because whatever um well you come back (29:55 - 29:59)
to me when they announce competitive (29:57 - 30:00)
Pokemon sleep cuzz I will give you all (29:59 - 30:03)
the switching strategies I will I will (30:00 - 30:06)
give you the beware meta right now I&#39;m (30:03 - 30:08)
on top of things didn&#39;t they have that (30:06 - 30:11)
like Esports uh trailer advertisement (30:08 - 30:13)
for the game where like they had uh (30:11 - 30:15)
people yeah that was like their April (30:13 - 30:18)
fools thing yeah yeah we that should (30:15 - 30:20)
just be reality that would be I&#39;d (30:18 - 30:22)
watched that it&#39; be awes go was an April (30:20 - 30:23)
Fool&#39;s Day (30:22 - 30:27)
thing before it came out so yeah it&#39;s (30:23 - 30:29)
possible true (30:27 - 30:30)
they&#39;ll need more more content for (30:29 - 30:33)
worlds uh speaking of Worlds uh we have (30:30 - 30:35)
some worlds updates and some other (30:33 - 30:37)
updates but we need to take a break so (30:35 - 30:39)
when we come back we will talk about all (30:37 - 30:42)
of that uh once again spending another (30:39 - 30:44)
30 minutes talking about Pokemon sleep (30:42 - 30:48)
uh we will be right back and we are back (30:44 - 30:49)
from our (30:48 - 30:54)
break uh let&#39;s talk about this first (30:49 - 30:55)
because I think I don&#39;t know how long (30:54 - 30:56)
this conversation is going to be this is (30:55 - 30:59)
off variety.com Pokemon series trainer (30:56 - 31:02)
tour sets release date on Prime video (30:59 - 31:06)
and Roku this was an exclusive on (31:02 - 31:10)
variety.com for whatever that means this (31:06 - 31:12)
came out of nowhere this is this is the (31:10 - 31:14)
segment where we&#39;re (31:12 - 31:17)
like this should be in a Pokemon (31:14 - 31:19)
presents and if there is a Pokemon (31:17 - 31:22)
present coming in the next 10 to 12 days (31:19 - 31:24)
I&#39;m sure that this will be in it because (31:22 - 31:26)
I feel like they&#39;ve done a very bad job (31:24 - 31:28)
at advertising this and if this is the (31:26 - 31:29)
first time you&#39;re hearing about this (31:28 - 31:31)
it&#39;s because they&#39;ve done a bad job (31:29 - 31:33)
advertising this (31:31 - 31:36)
um so I&#39;m going to explain what this is (31:33 - 31:39)
and then I&#39;m going to explain why maybe (31:36 - 31:40)
there won&#39;t be a Pokemon Direct I don&#39;t (31:39 - 31:42)
know Pokemon (31:40 - 31:45)

the show and it says quote meet and Men (32:26 - 32:30)
aspiring trainers looking to foster a (32:28 - 32:32)
connection with family and friends (32:30 - 32:33)
through their love of the Pokemon (32:32 - 32:36)
Trading Card (32:33 - 32:40)
Game and it is the first of its kind (32:36 - 32:42)
entertainment series for the Pokemon (32:40 - 32:43)
company International spotlighting (32:42 - 32:45)
individuals from Pokemon&#39;s incredibly (32:43 - 32:48)
diverse fan base while trainers Rec (32:45 - 32:50)
recount their own unique life (32:48 - 32:52)
experiences in each (32:50 - 32:55)
episode we hope the this passion extends (32:52 - 32:57)
to our viewers providing them a glimpse (32:55 - 32:58)
of what it means to be part of the (32:57 - 33:01)
Pokemon Community said Andy go senior (32:58 - 33:03)
director of media production at the (33:01 - 33:05)
Pokemon company International he also (33:03 - 33:07)
goes on and says this series offers fans (33:05 - 33:09)
an inside look into some varied (33:07 - 33:12)
experiences and heartfelt stories of (33:09 - 33:14)
some trainers who make up the diverse (33:12 - 33:16)
array of Pokemon (33:14 - 33:20)
fans and it&#39;s TCG based (33:16 - 33:23)
so uh there&#39;s a trailer on YouTube (33:20 - 33:26)
there&#39;s the first episode on (33:23 - 33:30)
YouTube the first takeaway here is that (33:26 - 33:33)
all of these streaming services Apple TV (33:30 - 33:36)
plus Prime video YouTube TV (33:33 - 33:39)
Netflix Paramount peacock there&#39;s too (33:36 - 33:44)
many oh my gosh uh HBO Max it&#39;s just (33:39 - 33:47)
called Max now just max Yep they&#39;re they (33:44 - 33:51)
all want exclusive content so you would (33:47 - 33:54)
look at this and go oh I want to watch (33:51 - 33:57)
the Pikachu trainer show I&#39;m going to (33:54 - 33:59)
sign sign up for Prime video so there (33:57 - 34:02)
has to be also this is like a whole (33:59 - 34:03)
production this isn&#39;t like an animated (34:02 - 34:05)
series or anything this is like we took (34:03 - 34:08)
these two content (34:05 - 34:10)
creators we put them on the bus we (34:08 - 34:13)
filmed shows with people we had to go (34:10 - 34:15)
out and find and then we had to like (34:13 - 34:17)
create and tell a story because each (34:15 - 34:19)
episode I think is like 20 minutes it&#39;s (34:17 - 34:21)
not like it&#39;s when I say A TCG thing (34:19 - 34:23)
it&#39;s not like let&#39;s turn on the TV and (34:21 - 34:26)
watch somebody open packs that wasn&#39;t (34:23 - 34:27)
like a dig at anyone there&#39;s nothing (34:26 - 34:28)
wrong with like like watching somebody (34:27 - 34:31)
open packs but like that&#39;s very (34:28 - 34:34)
like surface yeah like I think the third (34:31 - 34:37)
episode talks about how the trainer they (34:34 - 34:41)
found was literally about to die and (34:37 - 34:45)
there was no cure for his disease um I (34:41 - 34:48)
didn&#39;t know this person and that they (34:45 - 34:50)
they ended up did finding a cure so it&#39;s (34:48 - 34:54)
like his story of knowing I I have no (34:50 - 34:56)
clue how like I feel like that I I (34:54 - 34:58)
cannot put myself in that shoes of being (34:56 - 35:01)
told like you have X amount of time to (34:58 - 35:04)
live and then like changing your (35:01 - 35:08)
perspective on life to be like H and so (35:04 - 35:10)
that&#39;s pretty deep like and I feel like (35:08 - 35:12)
that&#39;s a really good selling point like (35:10 - 35:13)
if you were like on the fence about the (35:12 - 35:18)
show that sounds like there was a lot of (35:13 - 35:20)
research there was a lot of (35:18 - 35:23)
consideration and like each episode has (35:20 - 35:25)
a (35:23 - 35:28)
pretty I don&#39;t know deep (35:25 - 35:30)
it&#39;s it&#39;s just not like playing cards (35:28 - 35:32)
and opening cards is what I&#39;m saying (35:30 - 35:33)
right yeah it&#39;s going to make you you (35:32 - 35:35)
feel something it&#39;s not trying to I mean (35:33 - 35:36)
it is trying to sell you something (35:35 - 35:38)
because it is I mean largely you know (35:36 - 35:42)
brand uh you know pushing the brand (35:38 - 35:44)
forward in front of people but like in a (35:42 - 35:46)
way that is supposed to be heartfelt (35:44 - 35:48)
that might reach other people right (35:46 - 35:49)
right because like you you think of like (35:48 - 35:52)
oh there&#39;s already programming for a (35:49 - 35:54)
screen there&#39;s the anime there is (35:52 - 35:56)
competitive coverage but like this sort (35:54 - 35:59)
of emotional story storytelling (35:56 - 36:01)
especially when they couch it in like (35:59 - 36:02)
this Variety article they mentioned (36:01 - 36:06)
somewhere about um what it&#39;s like to be (36:02 - 36:09)
part of the Pokemon uh like community at (36:06 - 36:14)
large like I think I think kind (36:09 - 36:17)
of go building around that idea is super (36:14 - 36:19)
smart like really really smart because (36:17 - 36:21)
we know what that&#39;s like right but (36:19 - 36:23)
people that might not connect with other (36:21 - 36:27)
Pokemon fans in that way um would like (36:23 - 36:29)
to see what like before they commit to (36:27 - 36:32)
going to an in-person event or even to (36:29 - 36:33)
their local card shop right to meet (36:32 - 36:38)
other people yeah it is weird that there (36:33 - 36:40)
like to your point earlier Steve that (36:38 - 36:43)
there&#39;s been very little around this (36:40 - 36:45)
like there was like nothing around this (36:43 - 36:48)
until it actually came out and that&#39;s (36:45 - 36:49)
when I started (36:48 - 36:51)
seeing stuff about it was like right (36:49 - 36:53)
around that time but it didn&#39;t feel like (36:51 - 36:56)
there was any leadup to this happening (36:53 - 36:59)
to this coming out yeah so so last year (36:56 - 37:01)
in August it was August 8th there was a (36:59 - 37:04)
Pok√©mon presents it was 34 minutes long (37:01 - 37:05)
I&#39;m just going to I&#39;m just going to run (37:04 - 37:07)
through what they covered last year in (37:05 - 37:08)
case you forgot I should have made a (37:07 - 37:10)
YouTube video about this uh so last year (37:08 - 37:12)
they spent four minutes talking about (37:10 - 37:14)
the World Championships (37:12 - 37:16)
which they have talked about the World (37:14 - 37:19)
Championships a lot this last week and (37:16 - 37:21)
that could have been saved for for (37:19 - 37:23)
presents again maybe there could be a (37:21 - 37:25)
present but it would be a lot of (37:23 - 37:26)
information that&#39;s already out there (37:25 - 37:28)
which is not a bad thing cuz there&#39;s you (37:26 - 37:30)
should communicate in multiple ways not (37:28 - 37:32)
everyone reads sby not everyone goes to (37:30 - 37:34)
pokemon.com not everyone is on Twitter (37:32 - 37:36)
and nor should you be on Twitter anymore (37:34 - 37:40)
it sucks um but then they spent two (37:36 - 37:42)
minutes talking about path to the peak (37:40 - 37:44)
which was a brand new show TCG focused (37:42 - 37:47)
really great I think fantastic if you (37:44 - 37:50)
haven&#39;t seen that um they spent four (37:47 - 37:51)
minutes talking about detective Pikachu (37:50 - 37:54)
returns they spent uh 2 minutes talking (37:51 - 37:57)
about Pokemon Horizons again another TV (37:54 - 37:59)
show last year they talked about two TV (37:57 - 38:02)
shows um then they spent 2 minutes (37:59 - 38:04)
talking about Pok√©mon go they spent 2 (38:02 - 38:06)
minutes talking about Pokemon unite two (38:04 - 38:08)
minutes about master Ex two minutes (38:06 - 38:11)
about Cafe remix uh one minute talking (38:08 - 38:15)
about adding TCG and Pokemon Stadium 2 (38:11 - 38:18)
to the Nintendo online expansion pass (38:15 - 38:20)
one minute talking about Pokemon sleep (38:18 - 38:23)
which was good sleep day two minutes (38:20 - 38:26)
talking about Pala wins so another TV (38:23 - 38:28)
show brought up in last year&#39;s Pokemon (38:26 - 38:30)
Direct 3 minutes talking about how (38:28 - 38:32)
Mewtwo was coming to scarlet and violet (38:30 - 38:35)
raids and then a 10minute Hidden (38:32 - 38:38)
Treasures of area (38:35 - 38:41)
zero like showcase the DLC was coming (38:38 - 38:44)
out for (38:41 - 38:47)
um uh September 13th for the teal mask (38:44 - 38:49)
so they they there was 10 minutes spent (38:47 - 38:51)
on that to be fair all that 10 minutes (38:49 - 38:53)
was like not new stuff obviously they (38:51 - 38:56)
showed old stuff and like Scarlet Violet (38:53 - 38:59)
so when you kind of break that down of (38:56 - 39:01)
like where is a Pokemon present right (38:59 - 39:04)
now starting with the Mewtwo and mew (39:01 - 39:05)
thing we already know what they did for (39:04 - 39:07)
the summer they made a whole big deal (39:05 - 39:09)
about it we were getting the dondoo (39:07 - 39:11)
raids the the Gimme ghoul coming back (39:09 - 39:15)
the normal Tera Dragonite so that&#39;s (39:11 - 39:17)
three minutes kind of gone of course (39:15 - 39:19)
they could highlight that but as of (39:17 - 39:20)
right now two of those events are (39:19 - 39:21)
already over they already did the (39:20 - 39:24)
Pikachu event then they the dondoo is (39:21 - 39:26)
going to end this week and then there&#39;s (39:24 - 39:28)
the outbreaks (39:26 - 39:32)
uh Pala wins um Pokemon Horizons pack to (39:28 - 39:35)
the PE Peak path to the peak would all (39:32 - 39:39)
be substituted out for this trainer T I (39:35 - 39:40)
think it&#39;s called trainer tour is what (39:39 - 39:43)
it&#39;s called mhm and they would probably (39:40 - 39:45)
say in partnership with Prime video sign (39:43 - 39:47)
up for a Prime video account to watch (39:45 - 39:49)
all the episodes the first ones on (39:47 - 39:51)
YouTube ideally you go to YouTube you (39:49 - 39:53)
end up liking it you move over to the (39:51 - 39:55)
the next seven (39:53 - 39:59)
episodes um Nintendo switch online (39:55 - 40:00)
we&#39;re going to be talking about in a (39:59 - 40:02)
second cuz they did announce one game (40:00 - 40:04)
they already did their Cafe remix news (40:02 - 40:06)
for the week they already did their (40:04 - 40:08)
Pokemon go Fest news which last year (40:06 - 40:10)
they talked about Pokemon go Fest New (40:08 - 40:12)
York and the global events that happened (40:10 - 40:13)
although we&#39;re going to be talking about (40:12 - 40:16)
there is more Pokemon Go News (40:13 - 40:18)
coming um so that does leave like maybe (40:16 - 40:20)
two minutes for Masters maybe two (40:18 - 40:22)
minutes for unite there is no detective (40:20 - 40:25)
Pikachu this year there&#39;s no side game (40:22 - 40:29)
at all this year that isn&#39;t pocket so (40:25 - 40:31)
it&#39;s like do you do a present for pretty (40:29 - 40:34)
much everything we know including the (40:31 - 40:38)
game you just added to the Nintendo (40:34 - 40:38)
ehhop and the only thing we don&#39;t really (40:39 - 40:44)
know about is pocket and what&#39;s coming (40:41 - 40:51)
to unite and maybe Za but Za is still a (40:44 - 40:54)
stretch is it I see that&#39;s what I was (40:51 - 40:56)
thinking I thought maybe they would cuz (40:54 - 40:57)
like you said they they announced all (40:56 - 40:59)
these things already but they are kind (40:57 - 41:02)
of scattered right I mean like we were (40:59 - 41:04)
just saying they there was pretty much (41:02 - 41:06)
nothing about this trainer tour thing (41:04 - 41:09)
until it came out um which seems perfect (41:06 - 41:11)
for a present to Showcase that in a (41:09 - 41:13)
present right so I feel like they could (41:11 - 41:16)
recap the things they&#39;ve already said (41:13 - 41:17)
and then they could maybe say a little (41:16 - 41:20)
bit more about this about trainer tour (41:17 - 41:22)
and then they could have more about (41:20 - 41:23)
pocket they could have more they could (41:22 - 41:26)
have more about Legends Za and that (41:23 - 41:28)
could be a pres in itself right there I (41:26 - 41:31)
mean so in in 2022 they spent 2 minutes (41:28 - 41:33)
talking about the world championship 2 (41:31 - 41:35)
minutes on Pok√©mon go which was Ultra (41:33 - 41:37)
Beast were coming uh two minutes about (41:35 - 41:39)
Pokemon unite two minute one minute (41:37 - 41:42)
about Pokemon EX two minutes about Cafe (41:39 - 41:45)
remix and then 10 minutes for the third (41:42 - 41:47)
scarlet and violet trailer which was (41:45 - 41:51)
coming out that year right and then in (41:47 - 41:54)
2021 they (41:51 - 41:57)
spent uh two minutes talking about Unite (41:54 - 41:59)
a minute talking about Cafe Remix 2 (41:57 - 42:02)
minutes about master ex a minute talking (41:59 - 42:05)
about Pok√©mon go which was just the (42:02 - 42:08)
first the fiveyear anniversary and that (42:05 - 42:10)
they were adding Galler Pokemon to the (42:08 - 42:14)
game which I think ended up being wulu (42:10 - 42:16)
andet I think that was right yeah and (42:14 - 42:18)
like there&#39;s zashi and Z they spent (42:16 - 42:21)
eight and a half minutes of our our life (42:18 - 42:23)
that were never getting back talking (42:21 - 42:25)
about brilliant Diamond shining Pearl (42:23 - 42:27)
they spent a minute talking about the (42:25 - 42:30)
thega and palia Edition Nintendo switch (42:27 - 42:32)
light and then they spent 12 minutes (42:30 - 42:33)
talking about Legends (42:32 - 42:36)
archus and that would have been probably (42:33 - 42:39)
the second time talking about Legends (42:36 - 42:41)
archus because the first was on Pokemon (42:39 - 42:46)
day yes yes so I could very much see (42:41 - 42:48)
them talking about Legends Za in the (42:46 - 42:50)
same way that they talked about Legends (42:48 - 42:52)
archus in (42:50 - 42:55)
20121 talking about Legends Za maybe not (42:52 - 42:56)
as much if it&#39;s going to come out a (42:55 - 42:58)
little bit later but like still talking (42:56 - 43:00)
about Legend Za yeah this is kind of (42:58 - 43:02)
what I&#39;m thinking though you know the (43:00 - 43:04)
2021 they talk about Za but Za is coming (43:02 - 43:06)
in they talk about Za and Brilliant (43:04 - 43:08)
Diamond shining Pearl sh brilliant (43:06 - 43:09)
Diamond shining Pearl in August is (43:08 - 43:11)
coming out in what like three months (43:09 - 43:13)
after that so you kind of have to talk (43:11 - 43:17)
about it and then Legends is coming out (43:13 - 43:19)
five months after that 2022 they talk (43:17 - 43:21)
they end with 10 minutes of scarlet and (43:19 - 43:23)
violet but scarlet and violet is coming (43:21 - 43:26)
out in three months and then last year (43:23 - 43:28)
they talk about the DLC but the DLC is (43:26 - 43:31)
coming out in 3 months I don&#39;t think (43:28 - 43:33)
Legend Za is coming out in three months (43:31 - 43:34)
I don&#39;t even think it&#39;s coming out in (43:33 - 43:37)
five months so it does see I do think (43:34 - 43:39)
it&#39;s coming out in like five or six (43:37 - 43:42)
months personally don&#39;t think so at all (43:39 - 43:44)
oh really I still do I still think it&#39;s (43:42 - 43:48)
q1 2025 but um no not a chance not a (43:44 - 43:50)
chance feels optimistic we haven&#39;t seen (43:48 - 43:51)
anything outside of just like a kind a (43:50 - 43:53)
conceptual trailer though like that&#39;s (43:51 - 43:55)
the part that I get hung up on right so (43:53 - 43:57)
when they announced when they announced (43:55 - 43:59)
Legends archus they showed they showed (43:57 - 44:01)
the conceptual trailer they showed the (43:59 - 44:04)
starters they showed the actual gameplay (44:01 - 44:05)
footage where when you looked at that (44:04 - 44:06)
you were like why is that chai Meo (44:05 - 44:08)
running at three frames a second and (44:06 - 44:10)
then they showed what seemed to be an (44:08 - 44:12)
open world and everyone went with the (44:10 - 44:13)
fact that it was an open world but then (44:12 - 44:17)
they also said early (44:13 - 44:20)
2020 whatever early 2022 or 202 I don&#39;t (44:17 - 44:21)
remember what year it was think didn&#39;t (44:20 - 44:23)
they give a date they no they just said (44:21 - 44:27)
early early 2022 okay yes so they gave (44:23 - 44:29)
us starters they gave us actual game (44:27 - 44:31)
play they gave us a date when they (44:29 - 44:34)
showed Za they gave us a conceptual (44:31 - 44:38)
trailer no game playay no date no other (44:34 - 44:42)
information they just said a they just (44:38 - 44:44)
said (44:42 - 44:48)
2025 right yeah yeah that just 2025 (44:44 - 44:51)
where where they said early (44:48 - 44:55)
2020 two or whatever he (44:51 - 44:58)
was so they&#39;re playing closer to the (44:55 - 45:00)
chest I don&#39;t know I still think that I (44:58 - 45:02)
still think that there&#39;s a chance that (45:00 - 45:03)
we get (45:02 - 45:06)
it I think in a perfect world where (45:03 - 45:09)
scarlet and violet wasn&#39;t ridic (45:06 - 45:12)
ridiculed I think maybe they would have (45:09 - 45:13)
been (45:12 - 45:16)
more here&#39;s here&#39;s some gamepl here&#39;s (45:13 - 45:21)
here&#39;s a harder date but they were (45:16 - 45:24)
confident at that Pokemon day that (45:21 - 45:28)
Legends archus was early 20 24 and even (45:24 - 45:29)
on this podcast we were like what does (45:28 - 45:32)
that mean like why does it need to be (45:29 - 45:34)
early 2024 why can&#39;t it be like mid 20 (45:32 - 45:36)
like take your time like the game kind (45:34 - 45:38)
of looks rough but it ca it came out in (45:36 - 45:40)
January which is as early as it can be (45:38 - 45:44)
in 2021 like it wasn&#39;t like even if it (45:40 - 45:45)
came out in March people would be like (45:44 - 45:48)
Ah that&#39;s still early that&#39;s still early (45:45 - 45:51)
in the year but it came out in (45:48 - 45:53)
January this is what I (45:51 - 45:57)
think I think that (45:53 - 46:00)
just because we&#39;ve always gotten Pokemon (45:57 - 46:02)
games in (46:00 - 46:06)
November fans think that we need to get (46:02 - 46:07)
it in November but that&#39;s not true like (46:06 - 46:11)
we got we got black and white in April (46:07 - 46:13)
in the United States yeah most games (46:11 - 46:17)
before X and Y were not in November not (46:13 - 46:18)
released in the US November and just (46:17 - 46:21)
because we got one Pokemon main Series (46:18 - 46:23)
game in January which is not November (46:21 - 46:25)
doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;re getting the next one (46:23 - 46:29)
in January I think it doesn&#39;t I think (46:25 - 46:31)
that they&#39;re going to focus on pocket (46:29 - 46:34)
this year and maybe we get like a (46:31 - 46:37)
lighter trailer or whatnot but I still (46:34 - 46:39)
don&#39;t think we get a date for this game (46:37 - 46:42)
until the next Pokemon day I think they (46:39 - 46:46)
show up on next Pokemon day they show us (46:42 - 46:47)
because what what else is that Pokemon (46:46 - 46:50)
day going to have even if if if they (46:47 - 46:53)
give us the stuff now and then on the (46:50 - 46:56)
next Pokemon day they go here&#39;s gen 10 (46:53 - 46:58)
it feels like it sucks all the wind out (46:56 - 47:02)
of the legend sales the Legends stuff if (46:58 - 47:04)
the Legends isn&#39;t even announced like (47:02 - 47:06)
you kind of have to let things breathe a (47:04 - 47:08)
little bit at least now you&#39;re going to (47:06 - 47:09)
say well they did Diamond and Pearl and (47:08 - 47:11)
Legends arus at the same time they at (47:09 - 47:14)
least were sinno they were both CNO they (47:11 - 47:16)
kind of piggybacked off each other gen (47:14 - 47:20)
10 is going to be very different than (47:16 - 47:23)
what uh Callos going back to Callos is (47:20 - 47:25)
going to be hold on what did Pokemon day (47:23 - 47:27)
2022 bring us it brought us the trailer (47:25 - 47:30)
it brought us the initial gen N (47:27 - 47:33)
Stuff you you were asking me to bring (47:30 - 47:35)
that happened one month after archus (47:33 - 47:36)
came (47:35 - 47:39)
out yeah I thought that was that was (47:36 - 47:40)
pretty quick but archus was already out (47:39 - 47:43)
at that point and I am saying it&#39;s going (47:40 - 47:45)
to be out at this point there&#39;s no (47:43 - 47:48)
way why wouldn&#39;t they say early then if (47:45 - 47:50)
they were confident enough to say early (47:48 - 47:51)
when they announced Legends arus why (47:50 - 47:53)
would they not say early when they (47:51 - 47:55)
announced Legend Za why do they have to (47:53 - 47:56)
say early there it doesn&#39;t have to be a (47:55 - 47:59)
pattern they don&#39;t they don&#39;t want to (47:56 - 47:59)
because if it was early they would have (47:59 - 48:02)
said it was early no I still think I (47:59 - 48:04)
still think it&#39;s gonna I still think (48:02 - 48:06)
it&#39;s gonna be I don&#39;t know they just (48:04 - 48:09)
showed us so little and and and I don&#39;t (48:06 - 48:11)
know to me that mean they didn&#39;t show us (48:09 - 48:13)
anything to be clear they didn&#39;t show us (48:11 - 48:15)
anything they showed us a black and (48:13 - 48:16)
white blueprint of Pikachu running (48:15 - 48:18)
through through like that&#39;s not gameplay (48:16 - 48:20)
that&#39;s just a trailer doesn&#39;t mean that (48:18 - 48:22)
they don&#39;t have more of it they&#39;re not (48:20 - 48:24)
they don&#39;t they don&#39;t have to show us (48:22 - 48:26)
everything they have because they have (48:24 - 48:28)
it (48:26 - 48:31)
I I guess guess I guess it&#39;s true yeah (48:28 - 48:33)
but I I I feel like at this time where (48:31 - 48:35)
they&#39;re taking they&#39;re taking a year off (48:33 - 48:38)
from from uh putting out a bigger game (48:35 - 48:40)
like wouldn&#39;t you want to show that to (48:38 - 48:42)
to like satisfy your audience in the (48:40 - 48:44)
meantime even if it&#39;s just a Teensy bit (48:42 - 48:47)
right I don&#39;t I I&#39;m I think that the (48:44 - 48:49)
teaser that they did is almost going to (48:47 - 48:51)
do more than like showing a whole bunch (48:49 - 48:54)
of the game like I think that they could (48:51 - 48:56)
show more of the game in August I think (48:54 - 48:58)
they could very Prett much do that in (48:56 - 49:00)
August like if they wanted to do it as (48:58 - 49:02)
like a presenter or a director or (49:00 - 49:05)
whatever uh but like I don&#39;t know I (49:02 - 49:07)
think the teaser because they can plan (49:05 - 49:08)
it exactly who they want they don&#39;t have (49:07 - 49:11)
to have people like criticizing how the (49:08 - 49:13)
game looks criticizing any of that when (49:11 - 49:15)
that&#39;s already really hot on the (49:13 - 49:17)
internet because of scarlet Violet it (49:15 - 49:19)
makes a lot of sense to just show a (49:17 - 49:21)
teaser that&#39;s completely under their (49:19 - 49:23)
control and not going to have people (49:21 - 49:25)
being like well this game looks bad or (49:23 - 49:27)
this game looks whatever it&#39;s just (49:25 - 49:28)
excitement because there was so much (49:27 - 49:30)
around excitement around the original (49:28 - 49:33)
Legends game that it brings that back up (49:30 - 49:35)
to the top and it givs people really (49:33 - 49:38)
talking about it um I that&#39;s not to say (49:35 - 49:40)
that it couldn&#39;t come out later in 2025 (49:38 - 49:41)
I just have a feeling that it&#39;s going to (49:40 - 49:46)
be earlier than maybe it won&#39;t be (49:41 - 49:47)
January but I still think it&#39;s going to (49:46 - 49:51)
be in early (49:47 - 49:51)
2025 yeah as long as they avoid showing (49:52 - 49:59)
a tree I suppose like probably (49:55 - 49:59)
circum yeah (49:59 - 50:03)
exactly when we when we had Mr Joe SB on (50:03 - 50:09)
um he believed it was also going to be (50:06 - 50:11)
early and then he believed we were going (50:09 - 50:15)
to get gen 10 at the end of next year (50:11 - 50:17)
2024 and I said well what are they going (50:15 - 50:19)
to do for the (50:17 - 50:21)
30th and he said well they would spend (50:19 - 50:24)
all 30th promoting and celebrating gen (50:21 - 50:28)
10 mhm and I think again that falls into (50:24 - 50:30)
there must be patterns and they must (50:28 - 50:34)
follow them where I will I will go back (50:30 - 50:37)
and I will say where was Pokemon Gray (50:34 - 50:39)
where was Pokemon Z where was the the (50:37 - 50:42)
new forms of Eves in generation 8 (50:39 - 50:43)
because apparently according to the (50:42 - 50:45)
patterns we got new Eevees in gen two (50:43 - 50:47)
and gen 4 and gen six where were they in (50:45 - 50:50)
gen 8 right like the only thing this (50:47 - 50:52)
company has been consistent on is (50:50 - 50:54)
consistently breaking Pokemon&#39;s fans (50:52 - 50:57)
Minds by not following a pattern (50:54 - 51:02)
so like in my head if I was a marketer I (50:57 - 51:06)
go by and I will say like there could (51:02 - 51:08)
still be a Legends thing if they do a (51:06 - 51:10)
Pokemon presents I think August is the (51:08 - 51:12)
best time and if in that Pokemon (51:10 - 51:16)
presents there&#39;s a trailer sure but I I (51:12 - 51:20)
think that Legend Za is more of a summer (51:16 - 51:22)
or fall (51:20 - 51:27)
game and then gen and then at the Pres (51:22 - 51:31)
at Pokemon Day next year it&#39;s here&#39;s Za (51:27 - 51:33)
here&#39;s it coming out here&#39;s a little (51:31 - 51:36)
teaser that generation 10 is coming (51:33 - 51:39)
soon which they did with um what was (51:36 - 51:40)
that like was like sword and shield and (51:39 - 51:42)
stuff like hey let&#39;s go is coming but (51:40 - 51:44)
we&#39;re working on the Next Generation (51:42 - 51:46)
they&#39;ll acknowledge next year that (51:44 - 51:48)
they&#39;re working on the Next (51:46 - 51:51)
Generation and then next year we still (51:48 - 51:52)
get sword we still get Scarlet and (51:51 - 51:54)
violet as our next game through worlds (51:52 - 51:56)
because this year&#39;s one restricted (51:54 - 51:57)
Legend (51:56 - 52:00)
next year will be two restricted Legends (51:57 - 52:04)
which will then close out the cycle of (52:00 - 52:06)
scarlet and violet and you&#39;re like okay (52:04 - 52:09)
well where&#39;s gen 10 gen 10&#39;s not in the (52:06 - 52:13)
fall but then gen 10 is in the spring (52:09 - 52:14)
around the time where black and white (52:13 - 52:16)
came out and now we have a new format (52:14 - 52:19)
going into that worlds with the start of (52:16 - 52:21)
gen 10 like these games don&#39;t have to (52:19 - 52:24)
come out in the fall they prove (52:21 - 52:26)
that with with black and white they (52:24 - 52:28)
prove that with Legends archus they Prov (52:26 - 52:30)
that with older Pokemon games that I (52:28 - 52:31)
can&#39;t think of because I don&#39;t have (52:30 - 52:32)
every date (52:31 - 52:36)
memorized I I do think okay you&#39;re right (52:32 - 52:38)
sure they don&#39;t have to follow like (52:36 - 52:39)
their own patterns and that&#39;s totally (52:38 - 52:42)
fine I think the pattern especially of (52:39 - 52:44)
what Joe was talking about on that (52:42 - 52:47)
episode was more of like a (52:44 - 52:50)
generalized like oh they can celebrate (52:47 - 52:53)
the 30th anniversary with Gen 10 already (52:50 - 52:55)
being out versus like it being the tail (52:53 - 52:58)
end of the of the 30th Anniversary when (52:55 - 53:00)
Gen 10 comes out if it were to be like (52:58 - 53:02)
November yeah I also think releasing a (53:00 - 53:06)
game in the fall although it&#39;s like a (53:02 - 53:08)
Pokemon pattern as of lately with the (53:06 - 53:11)
main with like the main Generations is (53:08 - 53:13)
more of like a business decision because (53:11 - 53:16)
of holiday yeah so I think that it is (53:13 - 53:18)
the smartest decision business-wise to (53:16 - 53:21)
be releasing a new generation toward the (53:18 - 53:23)
end of the year because of the holiday (53:21 - 53:24)
and what that&#39;s going to do with the (53:23 - 53:27)
sales versus earlier in the year would (53:24 - 53:29)
agree to that until the DLC got (53:27 - 53:32)
introduced because they did what I said (53:29 - 53:34)
they were going to do last year which (53:32 - 53:36)
was it doesn&#39;t matter if the second half (53:34 - 53:39)
of the DLC is coming out or not they are (53:36 - 53:41)
still going to put a double pack out (53:39 - 53:44)
before Christmas and they did that and (53:41 - 53:46)
it didn&#39;t even include the second half (53:44 - 53:48)
so let&#39;s just say gen 10 comes out in (53:46 - 53:50)
April of their 30th Anniversary so not (53:48 - 53:53)
next year the year after the first DLC (53:50 - 53:55)
comes out around September October (53:53 - 53:58)
November there&#39;s your double pack and so (53:55 - 54:01)
now you get the you get your initial (53:58 - 54:03)
sales that you will and then you you you (54:01 - 54:05)
get to double dip on Christmas with (54:03 - 54:08)
here&#39;s the ultimate edition of gen 10 (54:05 - 54:10)
double pack on the Shelf at Target so (54:08 - 54:12)
Grandma can walk in and she can buy that (54:10 - 54:14)
and then she can buy a $20 gift card to (54:12 - 54:17)
fortnite and now Christmas is saved (54:14 - 54:20)
I yeah and then but then I&#39;m thinking (54:17 - 54:22)
out past I&#39;m thinking out past that year (54:20 - 54:24)
like I can&#39;t see them putting a DLC out (54:22 - 54:26)
in the same year that they put the like (54:24 - 54:27)
gen 10 out because I think they want to (54:26 - 54:31)
like keep gen 10 just the original how (54:27 - 54:33)
they put it out for a longer period of (54:31 - 54:34)
time than 6 months before they&#39;re (54:33 - 54:36)
introducing and having to start (54:34 - 54:40)
marketing DLC stuff for Gen 10 like I (54:36 - 54:41)
think they&#39;re going to want to give that (54:40 - 54:44)
you know nine months before they&#39;re now (54:41 - 54:46)
marketing the DLC of gen 10 to make sure (54:44 - 54:48)
people are completing or getting through (54:46 - 54:51)
gen 10 who have started the game when (54:48 - 54:52)
they did like I don&#39;t think they want to (54:51 - 54:53)
start marketing DLC for a game that (54:52 - 54:56)
comes out in April they don&#39;t want to (54:53 - 54:57)
start marketing that DLC three months (54:56 - 55:01)
later for a fall to winter release for (54:57 - 55:03)
that DLC yeah but aren&#39;t we like kind of (55:01 - 55:05)
like reverse engineering here like we&#39;re (55:03 - 55:07)
talking about a Legends game instead of (55:05 - 55:09)
generation 10 we&#39;re talking about the (55:07 - 55:12)
za8 in in like respect of the release (55:09 - 55:14)
window of 10 though right sorry cuz I&#39;m (55:12 - 55:16)
saying I&#39;m saying Legends in in early (55:14 - 55:18)
2025 to give us gen 10 in the end of (55:16 - 55:20)
2025 right here here&#39;s another thing (55:18 - 55:22)
that I feel like people are not talking (55:20 - 55:25)
about and let let&#39;s let&#39;s say Legends (55:22 - 55:27)
does come out early (55:25 - 55:29)
my early is (55:27 - 55:32)
like April or May I think Bobby&#39;s early (55:29 - 55:36)
is January maybe February I q1 I said q1 (55:32 - 55:39)
of 2025 (55:36 - 55:42)
uh everyone talked about how Legends (55:39 - 55:44)
archus was going to get DLC and it (55:42 - 55:46)
didn&#39;t help that there were people being (55:44 - 55:48)
like we found a hidden room in the code (55:46 - 55:50)
and maybe we&#39;re going to travel back to (55:48 - 55:52)
our house and and whatever right (55:50 - 55:54)
everyone thought there would be DLC now (55:52 - 55:55)
there&#39;s going to be like four people on (55:54 - 55:57)
YouTube being like I did get see we got (55:55 - 55:59)
the no we got the Daybreak update it you (55:57 - 56:02)
had to update the game it was it wasn&#39;t (55:59 - 56:05)
like go to the eShop spend $10 get a (56:02 - 56:07)
hold it wasn&#39;t like they added chart (56:05 - 56:08)
they didn&#39;t add any new Pokemon they (56:07 - 56:10)
didn&#39;t add any new areas they just (56:08 - 56:13)
updated how the outbreaks worked right (56:10 - 56:15)
um and that was cool and there was like (56:13 - 56:16)
a small small little storyline with like (56:15 - 56:19)
Bunch Laxon Ork it was it was like cool (56:16 - 56:21)
uh didn&#39;t like fundamentally changeed (56:19 - 56:22)
the game though it was like free for (56:21 - 56:24)
everyone but who&#39;s to say that Za (56:22 - 56:27)
doesn&#39;t actually have DLC right so if if (56:24 - 56:30)
you&#39;re like well well gen 10 has to come (56:27 - 56:32)
out at the end of next year because what (56:30 - 56:33)
are we going to do for the competitive (56:32 - 56:36)
format why are we just now why did we (56:33 - 56:38)
assume that Legends archus was supposed (56:36 - 56:41)
to get DLC which it didn&#39;t and we&#39;re not (56:38 - 56:43)
having the conversation about why what (56:41 - 56:46)
if Za has actual DLC and that&#39;s going to (56:43 - 56:48)
hold us over until gen 10 all I&#39;m saying (56:46 - 56:51)
is like I just don&#39;t think like I I feel (56:48 - 56:53)
like people are saying well it has to (56:51 - 56:55)
come out early because gen 10 has to (56:53 - 56:57)
come out after that which (56:55 - 57:00)
yes it does but like gen 10 doesn&#39;t have (56:57 - 57:04)
to come out next year and also gen 10 or (57:00 - 57:06)
any game doesn&#39;t have to come out in (57:04 - 57:10)
November like Legends archus didn&#39;t have (57:06 - 57:12)
to come out in January that game could (57:10 - 57:15)
have came out in March and it would have (57:12 - 57:17)
been fine yeah it&#39;s almost kind of weird (57:15 - 57:18)
it was January right like it doesn&#39;t (57:17 - 57:21)
make sense from at least from like our (57:18 - 57:23)
our armchair business perspective right (57:21 - 57:24)
like it only makes sense when you think (57:23 - 57:27)
about Legends was supposed to come out (57:24 - 57:28)
in November for the Christmas game and (57:27 - 57:30)
bdsp was supposed to come out in (57:28 - 57:35)
September on their 15th anniversary and (57:30 - 57:36)
both of those games got pushed two (57:35 - 57:39)
months yeah and I think they didn&#39;t want (57:36 - 57:41)
to to your point they didn&#39;t want to (57:39 - 57:44)
start getting gen 9 super hyped up on (57:41 - 57:46)
Pokemon day to then just release Legends (57:44 - 57:49)
right after they just hyped up gen 9 so (57:46 - 57:52)
release Legends first Pokemon Daye comes (57:49 - 57:54)
up they&#39;re hyping gen nine but legends (57:52 - 57:55)
is already in people&#39;s living rooms (57:54 - 57:57)
right so (57:55 - 57:58)
yeah but I I guess the question is how (57:57 - 58:00)
much breathing room does it actually (57:58 - 58:03)
need I don&#39;t I don&#39;t think Legend Za (58:00 - 58:04)
needs breathing room I think gen 10 (58:03 - 58:06)
needs breathing room I think anyone who (58:04 - 58:09)
has sat here and first off listened to (58:06 - 58:11)
an hour into this podcast uh probably (58:09 - 58:13)
would agree (58:11 - 58:17)
that gen n needed more (58:13 - 58:21)
time and if you if you believe that okay (58:17 - 58:23)
Legends needs to come out as soon as (58:21 - 58:27)
possible because gen 10 needs to follow (58:23 - 58:29)
I think they can go all of next year (58:27 - 58:32)
with no no gen 10 and I think they can (58:29 - 58:34)
they can make it to the 30th which makes (58:32 - 58:38)
sense 30th Anniversary generation 10 (58:34 - 58:40)
they took a lot longer this time and I (58:38 - 58:41)
think if there&#39;s a generation you (58:40 - 58:44)
probably shouldn&#39;t mess up it probably (58:41 - 58:47)
is your 10th Generation right like 10 is (58:44 - 58:49)
you like like every tech company in the (58:47 - 58:50)
world makes a big deal about like the (58:49 - 58:53)
10th version of their product like we&#39;re (58:50 - 58:55)
we&#39;re about to celebrate the 10th (58:53 - 58:57)
version of the Apple watch like the (58:55 - 58:59)
iPhone 10 was hugely celebrated Google (58:57 - 59:02)
made a big deal well not Google but (58:59 - 59:04)
whatever pixel you or not pixel the the (59:02 - 59:06)
Galaxy whatever Galaxy it was they made (59:04 - 59:09)
a big deal about it right Microsoft made (59:06 - 59:10)
a big deal about Windows 10 don&#39;t know (59:09 - 59:13)
if that was you know that one maybe (59:10 - 59:15)
Windows 10 ah but you know the the fact (59:13 - 59:17)
of the matter remains they made a big (59:15 - 59:20)
deal about it um The Branding was (59:17 - 59:26)
strong I I I just think like (59:20 - 59:26)
they can definitely use this year to (59:26 - 59:32)
breathe and I think pocket is more than (59:30 - 59:35)
enough to carry them throughout this (59:32 - 59:40)
year and I I and I think Legends can (59:35 - 59:43)
dominate all of next year and I think (59:40 - 59:46)
that gen 10 can dominate all of the 30th (59:43 - 59:48)
Anniversary like we&#39;re we&#39;re six month (59:46 - 59:50)
we&#39;re seven seven eight months into this (59:48 - 59:53)
year we&#39;ve heard nothing about Legends (59:50 - 59:56)
and pocket should be coming out before (59:53 - 59:57)
the end of of the year and I think (59:56 - 59:59)
pocket will dominate the end of the year (59:57 - 60:03)
well then if that&#39;s the case then I hope (59:59 - 60:05)
there is a lot to say for legend Za when (60:03 - 60:08)
it comes to TCG to anime and to all of (60:05 - 60:10)
that because they are already if you (60:08 - 60:11)
take other patterns of other things (60:10 - 60:13)
they&#39;re doing they&#39;re already just about (60:11 - 60:17)
through blueberry Academy for TCG right (60:13 - 60:18)
in September we&#39;re getting Stellar Crown (60:17 - 60:20)
which is going to be the start of the (60:18 - 60:23)
end of the Scarlet and violet era stuff (60:20 - 60:28)
in TCG so I I hope that the next year is (60:23 - 60:31)
going to be full of Legend Za themed TCG (60:28 - 60:33)
things because there (60:31 - 60:35)
isn&#39;t the TCG they&#39;re doing the trainer (60:33 - 60:39)
cards now so like brassus pseudo Widow (60:35 - 60:40)
is coming to the (60:39 - 60:42)
TCG yes so that&#39;s (60:40 - 60:45)
that&#39;s is there the rumored the Team (60:42 - 60:46)
Rocket stuff coming to the TCG yeah but (60:45 - 60:48)
that&#39;s all rumored to be done by like (60:46 - 60:52)
January 2025 like February of 2025 it&#39;s (60:48 - 60:55)
not like it&#39;s a full Year&#39;s worth of (60:52 - 60:57)
stuff so if if if Legends or sorry if (60:55 - 60:59)
Legends comes out next year and then (60:57 - 61:01)
they don&#39;t do gen 10 till the following (60:59 - 61:03)
year then they have to have a lot of (61:01 - 61:05)
content that&#39;s related to Legends Za on (61:03 - 61:09)
the TCG side to and other things to last (61:05 - 61:11)
throughout that entire time until gen 10 (61:09 - 61:13)
comes out because the sets for those (61:11 - 61:14)
Generations typically come out two to (61:13 - 61:16)
three months after the game for those (61:14 - 61:20)
Generations comes out so that&#39;s a lot of (61:16 - 61:23)
time for TCG for potentially anime stuff (61:20 - 61:25)
for all the other things that Pokemon (61:23 - 61:29)
does to not have gen 10 come out until (61:25 - 61:32)
like two years from now yeah that would (61:29 - 61:34)
be there&#39;s a lot there you make a really (61:32 - 61:36)
good argument with the TCG stuff because (61:34 - 61:38)
you&#39;re right they we&#39;re getting trapos (61:36 - 61:42)
very soon in the TCG next month in the (61:38 - 61:45)
the anime we&#39;re not even to quack waval (61:42 - 61:50)
or Skelly durge or mowar right like true (61:45 - 61:52)
it it took them a long time to get (61:50 - 61:57)
to the middle flato (61:52 - 61:57)
so like yeah TCG seems a little ahead of (61:57 - 62:04)
schedule anime seems fine and like even (62:01 - 62:06)
if the anime goes (62:04 - 62:08)
till gosh a whole another year even if (62:06 - 62:11)
it goes till August I think you you have (62:08 - 62:15)
you have some Za you have some Za anime (62:11 - 62:18)
or some spin-off or or Leal and Roy go (62:15 - 62:20)
to Kos (62:18 - 62:23)
for whatever even though I don&#39;t know (62:20 - 62:25)
how that makes sense because like it (62:23 - 62:27)
kind of depends on how and how they (62:25 - 62:29)
explore this this Mega Evolution aspect (62:27 - 62:31)
of Za though too right because then you (62:29 - 62:33)
can kind of go like on a a backwards (62:31 - 62:36)
like Nostalgia tour of previous Mega (62:33 - 62:38)
Evolutions and then celebrating new ones (62:36 - 62:39)
and even those new ones could be plugged (62:38 - 62:42)
into storylines that were like currently (62:39 - 62:46)
in depending right yeah yeah maybe there (62:42 - 62:48)
maybe there&#39;s part of me that&#39;s like I (62:46 - 62:50)
don&#39;t want to see gen 10 in November of (62:48 - 62:52)
next year because it feels rushed it (62:50 - 62:54)
feels rushed and it (62:52 - 62:58)
feels like I had an epiphany this last (62:54 - 63:01)
week is that the right word where when (62:58 - 63:03)
people would ask me what my favorite (63:01 - 63:05)
Pokemon game was I would say sword and (63:03 - 63:07)
shield and it&#39;s sword and shield for a (63:05 - 63:09)
lot of reasons it&#39;s like it was the (63:07 - 63:11)
first game I got really really into (63:09 - 63:12)
competitive and I qualified for Players (63:11 - 63:15)
cup and like I really liked raids and (63:12 - 63:17)
and doing that group content and I (63:15 - 63:19)
thought Dynamax Adventure was great and (63:17 - 63:21)
it was the first Pokemon game with like (63:19 - 63:24)
DLC and I thought they really handled (63:21 - 63:28)
DLC pretty well and and it&#39;s funny cuz (63:24 - 63:30)
like I&#39;m playing scarlet and violet and (63:28 - 63:33)
I&#39;m like in the savannah area and I&#39;m (63:30 - 63:35)
like running at literally like not (63:33 - 63:37)
exaggerating literally like three frames (63:35 - 63:38)
a second like people were like Oh I (63:37 - 63:40)
thought your stream froze and I was like (63:38 - 63:43)
no the the game is just we got to get (63:40 - 63:45)
past this part and like there&#39;s some (63:43 - 63:47)
points in the game where it runs fine um (63:45 - 63:50)
and I I genuinely think if scarland (63:47 - 63:52)
Violet did not have performance issues (63:50 - 63:54)
and scarland violet (63:52 - 63:58)
ran at a solid 30 frames a second and (63:54 - 63:59)
you didn&#39;t fall through the floor every (63:58 - 64:01)
now and then and raids weren&#39;t super (63:59 - 64:03)
well raids being leggy also is related (64:01 - 64:04)
to the fact that the game just runs (64:03 - 64:07)
poorly I really do think it would be a (64:04 - 64:10)
top three Pokemon game for almost (64:07 - 64:14)
everyone who played it like and I went (64:10 - 64:16)
back to every Pokemon game this past (64:14 - 64:18)
week I because I was trying to complete (64:16 - 64:20)
my I was filling in the holes of my (64:18 - 64:23)
living decks cuz my living decks was (64:20 - 64:26)
done but they it was filled half with (64:23 - 64:28)
shinies and half not with shinies and I (64:26 - 64:29)
was like well I want a shiny living deck (64:28 - 64:31)
so I need to move these out and all of a (64:29 - 64:34)
sudden I don&#39;t I need a regular togaru I (64:31 - 64:36)
need a regular uh tarantula I need a (64:34 - 64:39)
regular uh the lechon so I gotta go (64:36 - 64:41)
catch regular Pokemon because I don&#39;t (64:39 - 64:43)
have them so I&#39;m I&#39;m going back through (64:41 - 64:48)
old Pokemon games and bdsp is exactly (64:43 - 64:52)
how you remember it it it&#39;s it&#39;s there (64:48 - 64:54)
but I went back to sword and shield and (64:52 - 64:56)
I&#39;ve been telling people for years for (64:54 - 64:57)
ever since it came out like I like sword (64:56 - 64:59)
and shield better than Scarlet Violet (64:57 - 65:03)
and this is this week I I I don&#39;t like I (64:59 - 65:05)
I genuin think scarlet and violet is the (65:03 - 65:07)
best Pokemon game like when you&#39;re in (65:05 - 65:10)
the crown Tundra I&#39;m like oh I&#39;ll just (65:07 - 65:11)
go down to the village and I was like oh (65:10 - 65:15)
I I can&#39;t I can&#39;t jump off the edge (65:11 - 65:18)
right uh I can&#39;t like zoom out I like (65:15 - 65:20)
the camera pans in a different way when (65:18 - 65:23)
I&#39;m standing there in the crown tundra (65:20 - 65:25)
or the wild area or the aisle of armor I (65:23 - 65:27)
can only see (65:25 - 65:29)
three to five Pokemon around me which at (65:27 - 65:31)
the time was like really (65:29 - 65:33)
cool uh but when you&#39;re in scarland (65:31 - 65:37)
Violet you have 10 12 15 Pokemon around (65:33 - 65:42)
you like scarlet and violet has so much (65:37 - 65:44)
ambition and it does a lot of things and (65:42 - 65:46)
I think that&#39;s what also hurts it like (65:44 - 65:49)
it&#39;s trying to do so much and the frame (65:46 - 65:52)
rate suffers because of it and like the (65:49 - 65:54)
like the game bugs out and like when (65:52 - 65:56)
you&#39;re even flying in the over world and (65:54 - 65:58)
everything&#39;s like flickering like you (65:56 - 66:00)
can&#39;t fly in in sword and shield right (65:58 - 66:03)
you can only get on your simple bike (66:00 - 66:05)
right and you can&#39;t jump and you can&#39;t (66:03 - 66:07)
climb there&#39;s (66:05 - 66:09)
just there&#39;s just all of these little (66:07 - 66:11)
things that you take for granted in this (66:09 - 66:14)
game that runs so poorly and when you go (66:11 - 66:15)
backwards you&#39;re like yeah this game (66:14 - 66:19)
runs smoothly and it looks better but (66:15 - 66:22)
I&#39;m so restricted right in what I&#39;m (66:19 - 66:26)
actually able to do and not do it I (66:22 - 66:27)
don&#39;t think sword and shield are bad at (66:26 - 66:29)
any means but I just think like if (66:27 - 66:34)
scarlet and violet ran properly yeah a (66:29 - 66:36)
lot of people I think would be like this (66:34 - 66:38)
is an this this is the best Pokemon game (66:36 - 66:41)
they&#39;ve ever made and if they take that (66:38 - 66:44)
from gen n and they make a game that (66:41 - 66:46)
runs great for Gen 10 whether that&#39;s (66:44 - 66:48)
optimization or better Hardware coming (66:46 - 66:49)
in the (66:48 - 66:52)
future like we always talk about like (66:49 - 66:54)
what game is going to outsell red and (66:52 - 66:57)
blue I think gen 10 could be that game (66:54 - 66:59)
like gen n and gen 8 are the games that (66:57 - 67:03)
finally passed gold and silver right and (66:59 - 67:06)
I I think to your point and I I I could (67:03 - 67:08)
understand that you see how gen n (67:06 - 67:10)
performs and then you don&#39;t want gen 10 (67:08 - 67:12)
to be rushed because you don&#39;t want (67:10 - 67:13)
something similar to happen right where (67:12 - 67:16)
it&#39;s like this game could be amazing it (67:13 - 67:18)
got quote unquote rushed and then there (67:16 - 67:20)
were performance issues there are issues (67:18 - 67:22)
things like that I think one thing you (67:20 - 67:24)
know happen during Co yeah and that you (67:22 - 67:26)
know yeah that too I think one thing (67:24 - 67:29)
that&#39;s good is that they got to this (67:26 - 67:34)
open world game before gen 10 so all of (67:29 - 67:36)
these issues they&#39;re having they know (67:34 - 67:39)
about them they&#39;re very much aware if (67:36 - 67:41)
they just turn the internet on for a day (67:39 - 67:42)
they are very much aware of all the (67:41 - 67:45)
issues that they have with their games (67:42 - 67:46)
uh and they&#39;re able to work on that (67:45 - 67:48)
because they&#39;re not trying to reinvent (67:46 - 67:49)
they&#39;re not going to be Reinventing the (67:48 - 67:51)
game in that way again now they&#39;re able (67:49 - 67:54)
to work off of what they&#39;ve already done (67:51 - 68:00)
and fix those things for Gen 10 which I (67:54 - 68:02)
don&#39;t think will take will take as much (68:00 - 68:05)
time as creating an open world game for (68:02 - 68:09)
the first time so you know I I wouldn&#39;t (68:05 - 68:12)
be as worried at seeing gen 10 arrive at (68:09 - 68:14)
the end of next year because they&#39;ve (68:12 - 68:16)
done this once now and now they&#39;re able (68:14 - 68:19)
to work on it and it might not take as (68:16 - 68:21)
much time as like creating the whole (68:19 - 68:24)
thing from the from the beginning but so (68:21 - 68:26)
the i i largely agree with that I think (68:24 - 68:29)
the only other thing would be though um (68:26 - 68:31)
that that if they were making those (68:29 - 68:33)
improvements working with the exact same (68:31 - 68:35)
framework so they like you know we have (68:33 - 68:37)
the stepping stone now we just move (68:35 - 68:39)
forward and make something better right (68:37 - 68:42)
um on top of what we already made then a (68:39 - 68:43)
lot of those performance things would (68:42 - 68:45)
have been patched in some way and (68:43 - 68:49)
they&#39;re really like not right no and so (68:45 - 68:51)
no they removed like Pokemon and (68:49 - 68:53)
characters from towns and areas to make (68:51 - 68:55)
the games run better so now the towns (68:53 - 68:58)
just feel more empty right exactly so so (68:55 - 69:00)
in order to to get to an end point where (68:58 - 69:02)
they have all those things and the game (69:00 - 69:03)
runs better they&#39;re going to be (69:02 - 69:06)
revisiting and reworking foundational (69:03 - 69:09)
pieces of the engine whatever the case (69:06 - 69:10)
might be the the things that they&#39;re (69:09 - 69:12)
programming in there um so they&#39;re going (69:10 - 69:14)
to have to take that extra time in order (69:12 - 69:15)
to do that if they&#39;re going to do it (69:14 - 69:17)
which we all hope that they would right (69:15 - 69:20)
based on how everybody&#39;s been taking the (69:17 - 69:24)
like the last two years right yeah the (69:20 - 69:26)
conversation so (69:24 - 69:29)
but they also the Pokemon company also (69:26 - 69:31)
like famously doesn&#39;t fix their current (69:29 - 69:34)
games like in a way in a substantial way (69:31 - 69:36)
like there have been bugs in earlier (69:34 - 69:38)
games where like there&#39;s been (69:36 - 69:39)
gamebreaking bugs where they go in and (69:38 - 69:41)
they fix that but there have been other (69:39 - 69:44)
things where people yeah an X and Y uh (69:41 - 69:44)
there have been other things where (69:44 - 69:47)
people are there&#39;s a lot of complaints (69:44 - 69:48)
and you would think with the amount of (69:47 - 69:51)
complaining that&#39;s happened and like (69:48 - 69:54)
legitimate you know stuff they would go (69:51 - 69:56)
in and fix it and it&#39;s like they don&#39;t (69:54 - 69:57)
but in the next Generation like that&#39;s (69:56 - 69:59)
not it&#39;s not an issue but it&#39;s like for (69:57 - 70:02)
that game there aren&#39;t they don&#39;t do the (69:59 - 70:04)
fixes you think that they they would (70:02 - 70:06)
like I mean I think you hear more (70:04 - 70:08)
complaining about both sword and shield (70:06 - 70:12)
and Scarlet and violet because they both (70:08 - 70:16)
sold 23 million copies and you and I&#39;ve (70:12 - 70:18)
said this before and I still stand by (70:16 - 70:20)
this there were more people complaining (70:18 - 70:23)
about black and white and how they (70:20 - 70:25)
handled black and white with new pokemon (70:23 - 70:27)
new area new things at the time it just (70:25 - 70:30)
Tik Tok wasn&#39;t a thing Twitter wasn&#39;t (70:27 - 70:32)
Twitter was like two years old when (70:30 - 70:35)
black and white came out um but also (70:32 - 70:38)
black and white only sold 14 million cop (70:35 - 70:40)
15 maybe 15 million copies like that&#39;s (70:38 - 70:44)
10 million more people and if only if (70:40 - 70:47)
only like one if one of those 20 people (70:44 - 70:50)
complain out of 10 million that&#39;s still (70:47 - 70:52)
math I cannot do in this moment but (70:50 - 70:54)
that&#39;s still a lot more people (70:52 - 70:56)
complaining (70:54 - 71:00)
but even even bdsp 14 million copies a (70:56 - 71:02)
lot of people complain about bdsp but a (71:00 - 71:03)
lot of more people complain about (71:02 - 71:06)
Scarlet Violet a lot 10 more 10 million (71:03 - 71:08)
more people bought that (71:06 - 71:11)
game um for sure and I think there&#39;s (71:08 - 71:14)
like there is there a lot of Pokemon (71:11 - 71:15)
fans have Nostalgia glasses a lot of (71:14 - 71:17)
Pokemon fans think like oh game freak&#39;s (71:15 - 71:21)
quality got worse over the years no like (71:17 - 71:23)
I&#39;m one of the biggest Pokemon fans in (71:21 - 71:25)
the world game freak has never been good (71:23 - 71:27)
at making video games the the fact that (71:25 - 71:30)
red and blue even ran properly is (71:27 - 71:34)
mindblowing and then in in s in uh gold (71:30 - 71:36)
and silver they introduced like 13 new (71:34 - 71:39)
pokeballs none of them work none of them (71:36 - 71:42)
do what they&#39;re supposed to do at all (71:39 - 71:44)
every single apricorn ball except for (71:42 - 71:46)
like one is broken and doesn&#39;t actually (71:44 - 71:48)
program what they&#39;re supposed to do they (71:46 - 71:53)
like they like in in in in in hoen the (71:48 - 71:55)
all your berries break after a year (71:53 - 71:56)
unless you (71:55 - 71:58)
unless you one connect to Coliseum or (71:56 - 72:01)
Gale of Darkness to update it or two you (71:58 - 72:03)
mailed your cartridge into Nintendo to (72:01 - 72:06)
fix your berries like I can like I can (72:03 - 72:08)
go every Pokemon game has some severe (72:06 - 72:11)
broken thing maybe except for like black (72:08 - 72:12)
and white I think had a lot going (72:11 - 72:14)
there&#39;s like some things in black and (72:12 - 72:16)
white you can make it crash doing (72:14 - 72:19)
certain things but I think the worst (72:16 - 72:22)
Pokemon game by far ever made was BR was (72:19 - 72:25)
Diamond and Pearl there like and I know (72:22 - 72:26)
people like I love diamond pearl they&#39;re (72:25 - 72:28)
my first Pokemon games I&#39;m not saying (72:26 - 72:30)
that they&#39;re not good or fun (72:28 - 72:32)
or I didn&#39;t have a great time playing (72:30 - 72:34)
Diamond pearl I think fundamentally on a (72:32 - 72:37)
structure coding game development level (72:34 - 72:39)
they are the worst Pokemon games but (72:37 - 72:43)
then the next year or the game after (72:39 - 72:46)
Platinum is one of the best Pokemon (72:43 - 72:48)
games Game Freak has ever made like they (72:46 - 72:51)
literally learned everything they did in (72:48 - 72:53)
Diamond and Pearl and they made a (72:51 - 72:57)
significantly better game exactly and (72:53 - 72:59)
yes I think I I think Bobby is right (72:57 - 73:00)
that they could learn everything in gen (72:59 - 73:03)
nine and gen 10 is the better more (73:00 - 73:09)
perfect open world game and stuff uh (73:03 - 73:12)
but that doesn&#39;t mean people don&#39;t feel (73:09 - 73:14)
soured (73:12 - 73:18)
with scarlet and violet and if any if (73:14 - 73:20)
the if the there&#39;s a if there&#39;s a (73:18 - 73:21)
different takeaway from this (73:20 - 73:24)
conversation is I don&#39;t (73:21 - 73:27)
think adding an extra year to gen 10 and (73:24 - 73:29)
coming out in the 30th anniversary and (73:27 - 73:32)
not the end of the 29th anniversary I (73:29 - 73:35)
don&#39;t think that hurts them by any means (73:32 - 73:38)
if they take more time I just think it (73:35 - 73:40)
has to do with the scheduling of (73:38 - 73:42)
everything around that isn&#39;t the games (73:40 - 73:45)
so again the TCG the anime I know you (73:42 - 73:47)
said the anime is kind of like moving it (73:45 - 73:49)
along at a at a fine Pace but yeah yeah (73:47 - 73:52)
I you know like and maybe I&#39;m (73:49 - 73:55)
misremembering but legends archus like (73:52 - 73:58)
Hui only popped up as a as like a web (73:55 - 74:00)
series thing more so there wasn&#39;t like a (73:58 - 74:03)
whole season of Pokemon dedicated to Hui (74:00 - 74:06)
right no they did movie thing so that (74:03 - 74:09)
makes me wonder like you know would they (74:06 - 74:12)
even have an anime thing for legend Za (74:09 - 74:15)
like or would it be more of a CU they (74:12 - 74:17)
broke the pattern they got rid of I&#39;m (74:15 - 74:19)
not like I I&#39;m not see you later (74:17 - 74:24)
buddy gloves are off yeah um you know I (74:19 - 74:26)
they don&#39;t have to follow pattern like I (74:24 - 74:27)
I&#39;m really not like I do like to look (74:26 - 74:29)
for the patterns but I I&#39;m not someone (74:27 - 74:31)
that thinks like if it doesn&#39;t follow it (74:29 - 74:34)
I&#39;m not shocked you know but but I do (74:31 - 74:36)
think when it comes to again the (74:34 - 74:38)
business side of things when it comes to (74:36 - 74:41)
how they have other products coming out (74:38 - 74:43)
that are in line with these things it (74:41 - 74:45)
does just make me curious as to what (74:43 - 74:47)
they would do so if they do wait an (74:45 - 74:51)
extra year for Gen 10 um that could be (74:47 - 74:52)
very interesting for what the TCG brings (74:51 - 74:54)
you know maybe they do bring back a lot (74:52 - 74:56)
of older stuff with the TC or maybe (74:54 - 75:00)
Legend Za is a much bigger uh like game (74:56 - 75:01)
than we think and has a lot more to it (75:00 - 75:04)
and they can create a lot out of that so (75:01 - 75:07)
um you know while I do think I still do (75:04 - 75:08)
if someone&#39;s gonna ask me what my guess (75:07 - 75:11)
is I still do think early 2025 for (75:08 - 75:16)
Legends and end of 2025 for Gen 10 but I (75:11 - 75:19)
do am curious as to what they could do (75:16 - 75:20)
with the other things if that&#39;s not the (75:19 - 75:22)
case and they do stretch things out a (75:20 - 75:26)
little bit further (75:22 - 75:26)
we should take a (75:27 - 75:29)
break uh also uh trainer tour it&#39;s a new (75:31 - 75:36)
TV show it&#39;s on Amazon I haven&#39;t watched (75:34 - 75:40)
it yet but oh and by the way Roku TV or (75:36 - 75:42)
Roku Channel if for those who have a (75:40 - 75:48)
Roku TV I do um is typically free so go (75:42 - 75:50)
there and check your Roku Channel (75:48 - 75:52)
because it says it&#39;s on there as well um (75:50 - 75:55)
you may not be having to pay for Amazon (75:52 - 75:56)
Prim (75:55 - 75:58)
I haven&#39;t watched it so I can&#39;t tell you (75:56 - 76:01)
if it&#39;s worth it yeah well also episode (75:58 - 76:03)
one is on the is on the Pokemon channel (76:01 - 76:05)
is on the Pokemon company&#39;s YouTube as (76:03 - 76:07)
well so you can watch that without (76:05 - 76:09)
having to pay for anything I was looking (76:07 - 76:11)
at the episode list too and it looks (76:09 - 76:12)
like the first episode is like 19 (76:11 - 76:14)
minutes the other ones like are around (76:12 - 76:18)
30 like 28 to 34 is the spread so oh wow (76:14 - 76:21)
that that first one is like truly pilot (76:18 - 76:24)
e mhm yeah yeah did we did did I say it (76:21 - 76:26)
sound like (76:24 - 76:28)
feels like a lot of money went into this (76:26 - 76:30)
yeah the production level looks really (76:28 - 76:34)
high yeah yeah it doesn&#39;t just feel like (76:30 - 76:36)
we took an iPhone into somebody&#39;s house (76:34 - 76:37)
and and recorded an interview and then (76:36 - 76:40)
chopped it up like the Pikachu Bus Is (76:37 - 76:43)
Awesome on its own yeah yeah yeah uh all (76:40 - 76:45)
right let&#39;s take a break and then we&#39;ll (76:43 - 76:47)
wrap up the show with uh some smaller (76:45 - 76:50)
news we&#39;ll be right back and we are back (76:47 - 76:53)
from our break uh so yeah we talked (76:50 - 76:56)
about what would maybe be in a Pokemon (76:53 - 77:00)
presents this would be ideally in a (76:56 - 77:02)
Pokemon presents if that shows up which (77:00 - 77:04)

home also Game Informer was here in (77:28 - 77:34)
Minneapolis oh really oh yeah yeah was (77:30 - 77:36)
it was it still a perk to I should know (77:34 - 77:38)
this because I am a GameStop Pro member (77:36 - 77:41)
but was it still a perk to GameStop Pro (77:38 - 77:43)
like membership I think you got the (77:41 - 77:46)
digital version as a G Pro okay yeah I (77:43 - 77:48)

Pokemon cards at GameStop oh okay that&#39;s (77:56 - 78:00)
fair I didn&#39;t consider that it really (77:58 - 78:02)
came down to like I just get $5 a month (78:00 - 78:05)
off with the pro membership so I just go (78:02 - 78:07)
in once a month to get my packs of cards (78:05 - 78:09)

days fair enough yeah barely do maybe (78:09 - 78:15)
Bobby was like secretly a big funco fan (78:13 - 78:16)
and they&#39;re like I&#39;m getting all my (78:15 - 78:19)
funco at GameStop oh thank goodness (78:16 - 78:21)
after years we&#39;ve a third of the store (78:19 - 78:25)
is what I wanted finally (78:21 - 78:27)
I wasn&#39;t interested in your store until (78:25 - 78:30)
half the wall was fun copon where are (78:27 - 78:32)
the video (78:30 - 78:35)
games okay so Pokemon Mystery Dungeon (78:32 - 78:38)
Rescue Team DX is on the switch but the (78:35 - 78:42)
Nintendo original from 2005 is now (78:38 - 78:46)
coming on August 9th red Rescue Team (78:42 - 78:49)
Will Mark the first AR arrival of the (78:46 - 78:51)
first ever Pokemon title from the age of (78:49 - 78:54)
the Game Boy Advance to launch a (78:51 - 78:57)
Nintendo switch online (78:54 - 78:57)
that&#39;s and that&#39;s pretty much it it&#39;s (78:57 - 79:02)
it&#39;s just it&#39;s just red Rescue Team um I (78:59 - 79:08)
do think it&#39;s weird that the DX version (79:02 - 79:10)
is on the (79:08 - 79:12)
switch and this is the version they (79:10 - 79:15)
decided to (79:12 - 79:18)
put (79:15 - 79:21)
uh I look I don&#39;t like Mystery Dungeon (79:18 - 79:23)
games let&#39;s make that very clear I don&#39;t (79:21 - 79:26)
think they&#39;re particularly engaging or (79:23 - 79:28)
fun I know some people are like ah the (79:26 - 79:32)
story is amazing I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know (79:28 - 79:33)

like try something like yogurt and (80:14 - 80:18)
you&#39;re like man I don&#39;t like that and (80:16 - 80:19)
then you keep going back to the store (80:18 - 80:22)
buying different brands hoping that like (80:19 - 80:25)
maybe this brand of yogurt will be like (80:22 - 80:28)
the one that I like mhm that&#39;s sparing (80:25 - 80:30)
water oh yeah I&#39;ve done that with (80:28 - 80:33)
sparkling water too like or like the (80:30 - 80:35)
surely the Cucumber flavor will make me (80:33 - 80:37)
change my (80:35 - 80:39)
mind that&#39;s how I feel with mystery (80:37 - 80:43)
dungeon I I everyone I try I&#39;m like this (80:39 - 80:45)
will be the one they&#39;ll change more than (80:43 - 80:48)
enough things they&#39;ll something will (80:45 - 80:52)
grab me and it just it never does it and (80:48 - 80:55)
Nintendo did send me a copy of (80:52 - 80:59)
re Rescue Team DX which came out March 6 (80:55 - 81:01)
2020 I have it (80:59 - 81:04)
here and the quiz loved the quiz the (81:01 - 81:06)
little like Pokemon personality quiz (81:04 - 81:08)
really great loved it and then as soon (81:06 - 81:11)
as I got in the first dungeon I was like (81:08 - 81:13)
I&#39;m I&#39;m I&#39;m good I checked out (81:11 - 81:15)
[Laughter] (81:13 - 81:18)
like it&#39;s it&#39;s just not the I know (81:15 - 81:20)
there&#39;s tons of people who play scarlet (81:18 - 81:21)
and violet or sword and shield or sun (81:20 - 81:23)
and moon and they just don&#39;t like (81:21 - 81:26)
battling Pokemon they they want to avoid (81:23 - 81:28)
all the trainers they want to they they (81:26 - 81:30)
just want to catch they just want the (81:28 - 81:33)
story they just want to wash their (81:30 - 81:36)
Cycles are with the the Marie sponge I (81:33 - 81:38)
understand you can&#39;t really skip the (81:36 - 81:41)
battling stuff in Mystery Dungeon yeah (81:38 - 81:44)
it&#39;s just it&#39;s just (81:41 - 81:47)
there are you able to shiny hunt in any (81:44 - 81:49)
way in the in these games in the new one (81:47 - 81:52)
in the DX one you can oh okay I&#39;m (81:49 - 81:54)
surprised that you know that didn&#39;t that (81:52 - 81:56)
didn&#39;t grab you in some way then sure (81:54 - 81:58)
did not I don&#39;t think it grabbed a lot (81:56 - 81:59)
of people (81:58 - 82:02)
out oh there&#39;s also like the the these (81:59 - 82:03)
these Pokemon fans that are like if they (82:02 - 82:05)
just add shinies to these games we heard (82:03 - 82:07)
this a lot with like new Pokemon Snap (82:05 - 82:10)
like if new Pokemon Snap had (82:07 - 82:13)
shinies Mystery Dungeon DX had shinies (82:10 - 82:16)
it did not did not like suddenly sell a (82:13 - 82:18)
million more copies to it like you still (82:16 - 82:22)
have to play Rescue Team DX to get to (82:18 - 82:25)
that point and if you don&#39;t like that it (82:22 - 82:27)
doesn&#39;t look Pokemon Masters has Shiny (82:25 - 82:29)
Pokemon a lot actually there&#39;s like an (82:27 - 82:32)
egg system there&#39;s (82:29 - 82:35)
banners somebody got convinced I&#39;m sure (82:32 - 82:37)
somebody was like I didn&#39;t start playing (82:35 - 82:39)
Masters until they added Chinese but I (82:37 - 82:42)
think like the majority average player (82:39 - 82:45)
if you just don&#39;t like the game play I (82:42 - 82:46)
don&#39;t think shinies is going to push you (82:45 - 82:49)
over the edge unless you get one early (82:46 - 82:52)
on you&#39;re like oh oh oh that that was (82:49 - 82:54)
great oh you know what I&#39;m going to (82:52 - 82:55)
chase this for the of My (82:54 - 82:59)
[Laughter] (82:55 - 83:01)
Life (82:59 - 83:04)
um I believe Game Boy advanced games and (83:01 - 83:07)
Nintendo 64 games you need the upgraded (83:04 - 83:10)
NSO yep you do expansion pack membership (83:07 - 83:11)
you (83:10 - 83:13)
do (83:11 - 83:15)
yep again (83:13 - 83:18)
not yeah this would have been a nice (83:15 - 83:19)
this would have been a minute of the (83:18 - 83:20)
this would have been a minute of the (83:19 - 83:22)
presents yeah right yeah this would (83:20 - 83:24)
definitely been a minute of the presents (83:22 - 83:26)
yeah for (83:24 - 83:29)
sure it&#39;s been the switch has been out (83:26 - 83:32)
for what seven years Yeah March continue (83:29 - 83:35)
to use the word Virtual Console you know (83:32 - 83:36)
what Nintendo hasn&#39;t used in the last (83:35 - 83:39)
seven years the term virtual console (83:36 - 83:40)
that that does not technically exist on (83:39 - 83:44)
the switch (83:40 - 83:48)
uh I don&#39;t think we&#39;re seeing any (83:44 - 83:51)
Pokemon games that I mean like red blue (83:48 - 83:55)
Ruby Sapphire we&#39;ve covered those rumors (83:51 - 83:57)
or that news on this show I think (83:55 - 83:59)
there&#39;s like a click baity thumbnail I (83:57 - 84:02)
made of a Nintendo switch with like (83:59 - 84:04)
Kyogre on groud on them because that (84:02 - 84:06)
news was so prevalent at the time that (84:04 - 84:07)
we had to cover (84:06 - 84:10)
it it&#39;s been seven (84:07 - 84:13)
years there&#39;s a new Switch (84:10 - 84:18)
coming I don&#39;t know what value at this (84:13 - 84:22)
point it would be to add them I will pay (84:18 - 84:25)
$1,000 for them to put a low no I mean (84:22 - 84:28)
maybe you would Bobby (84:25 - 84:32)
but come on Nintendo i&#39; donate to your (84:28 - 84:34)
GoFundMe for that Bobby but I don&#39;t (84:32 - 84:36)
think I would partake (84:34 - 84:40)
myself I just yeah I just want them to (84:36 - 84:42)
put that alola on there so bad yeah it&#39;s (84:40 - 84:46)
just SE seven years of like like I just (84:42 - 84:48)
like I feel like every every Pokemon day (84:46 - 84:50)
there&#39;s there&#39;s there&#39;s somebody on (84:48 - 84:52)
Twitter with a million retweets of like (84:50 - 84:56)
this is the year they&#39;re adding Ruby and (84:52 - 84:58)
Sapphire for seven years straight and (84:56 - 85:00)
it&#39;s never it hasn&#39;t happened now I will (84:58 - 85:02)
say (85:00 - 85:05)
um the I don&#39;t know if we talked about (85:02 - 85:09)
this on the show but red blue yellow (85:05 - 85:12)
gold silver Crystal all of those games (85:09 - 85:17)
combined on the on the Nintendo 3DS all (85:12 - 85:22)
of them combined sold 1.5 (85:17 - 85:25)
million that&#39;s not a lot no (85:22 - 85:29)
no it&#39;s not for six games and let&#39;s be (85:25 - 85:31)
honest if if you were to probably (85:29 - 85:32)
separate and pull them out it was (85:31 - 85:36)
probably Crystal and yellow well they (85:32 - 85:38)
did the thing the most they did the (85:36 - 85:41)
thing where they released Crystal a bit (85:38 - 85:43)
later after gold and silver so like I (85:41 - 85:46)
was someone who bought silver and then (85:43 - 85:48)
you know later they&#39;re like oh here&#39;s (85:46 - 85:50)
Crystal and it was like great now I (85:48 - 85:52)
gotta go buy this like you know release (85:50 - 85:53)
them all at the same time let people (85:52 - 85:57)
choose um is somebody who whose favorite (85:53 - 85:59)
version is Crystal seeing that like (85:57 - 86:02)
Global sales chart every time and seeing (85:59 - 86:06)
crystal is is heartbreaking each (86:02 - 86:10)
time yeah yeah uh I (86:06 - 86:10)
just I just don&#39;t think at this point (86:11 - 86:16)
it&#39;s coming right I agree I I could (86:13 - 86:17)
understand the optimism of like the (86:16 - 86:19)
first maybe two three years of the (86:17 - 86:22)
switch but then you you also you know (86:19 - 86:24)
even removing Pokemon games from the (86:22 - 86:26)
factor of from that factor like there&#39;s (86:24 - 86:31)
just NSO hasn&#39;t added a ton of games in (86:26 - 86:36)
general yeah uh compared to like I (86:31 - 86:39)
remember as an owner of the Nintendo Wii (86:36 - 86:41)
every Friday they would add at least (86:39 - 86:45)
like four games to the Virtual Console (86:41 - 86:48)
mhm and every Friday I would buy at (86:45 - 86:51)
least one I was a dumb like 20-year-old (86:48 - 86:54)
with my first job living on my own and (86:51 - 86:56)
every every Friday i&#39; be like what four (86:54 - 86:59)
games oh cool sin and Punishment let&#39;s (86:56 - 87:01)
buy that (86:59 - 87:01)
one I don&#39;t know but like the these (87:02 - 87:06)
older games though like we&#39;re not (87:04 - 87:09)
talking about current generation games (87:06 - 87:10)
on this hardware and then the new (87:09 - 87:11)
hardware comes out and then suddenly (87:10 - 87:13)
they&#39;re outdated right these games are (87:11 - 87:15)
already outdated that&#39;s the point and so (87:13 - 87:18)
as long as they as long as they support (87:15 - 87:21)
the same stuff as far as like this (87:18 - 87:23)
Virtual Console stuff is concerned I (87:21 - 87:24)
don&#39;t think it makes a difference if (87:23 - 87:25)
they really releas it hour or later (87:24 - 87:27)
right I do because I don&#39;t trust (87:25 - 87:29)
Nintendo we went from the Wii to the Wii (87:27 - 87:31)
U we went from the Wii to the Wii U and (87:29 - 87:34)
I had to import all my games from the (87:31 - 87:38)
Wii to the Wii U which was like but you (87:34 - 87:41)
had to like launch the Wii app and then (87:38 - 87:44)
in the Wii app you had to launch those (87:41 - 87:46)
games oh go well I mean the Wii U was (87:44 - 87:48)
just kind of a misstep in general right (87:46 - 87:51)
I mean an evolution step to the switch (87:48 - 87:52)
though right I mean it was true it was (87:51 - 87:55)
like the start of like hey take this (87:52 - 87:56)
controller and then play it like away (87:55 - 87:59)
from your console but only like in the (87:56 - 88:03)
same room as your console yeah yeah know (87:59 - 88:04)
the switch is the switch is definitely (88:03 - 88:07)
like a textbook example of like follow (88:04 - 88:09)
through actually working in a (88:07 - 88:11)
development standpoint yeah but I don&#39;t (88:09 - 88:12)
know (88:11 - 88:15)
like I I mentioned this on the break uh (88:12 - 88:16)
this last break but I I really think (88:15 - 88:18)
that the switch is like the first (88:16 - 88:20)
Nintendo console that really brings it (88:18 - 88:23)
up to up to date as far as like approach (88:20 - 88:27)
goes for them for like having live games (88:23 - 88:30)
that are supported because it&#39;s always (88:27 - 88:33)
connected to your WiFi or it&#39;s hard (88:30 - 88:35)
lined uh when you have it uh on your (88:33 - 88:38)
dock right and so I mean I think it&#39;s (88:35 - 88:40)
much more likely that they&#39;ll build out (88:38 - 88:42)
this platform especially now that (88:40 - 88:44)
they&#39;ve taken like the the 3DS shop down (88:42 - 88:47)
right like yeah they&#39;re they only really (88:44 - 88:49)
have to maintain this one thing and it (88:47 - 88:50)
would be a huge selling point because (88:49 - 88:51)
they&#39;ve been really slowly building up (88:50 - 88:55)
the library for um the the Virtual (88:51 - 88:57)
Console stuff and for its premium (88:55 - 88:59)
version I think it would be almost (88:57 - 89:01)
foolish which I mean you know it could (88:59 - 89:04)
still happen even if it seems foolish it (89:01 - 89:05)
it would be foolish for them to not (89:04 - 89:08)
bring it over as potentially like a (89:05 - 89:10)
launch thing like hey like we&#39;re adding (89:08 - 89:12)
50 more games to each of these as well (89:10 - 89:14)
so that they can start getting people to (89:12 - 89:17)
buy into that Hardware there um and (89:14 - 89:19)
maybe discount the version that&#39;s on the (89:17 - 89:21)
original switch As a (89:19 - 89:25)
result so the only thing (89:21 - 89:27)
that would well one of the main things (89:25 - 89:29)
that would tell me that they would never (89:27 - 89:31)
bring these Pokemon games ruby and (89:29 - 89:34)
sapphire red blue yellow those things to (89:31 - 89:37)
like a switch um the online subscription (89:34 - 89:40)
is because it&#39;s an online subscription (89:37 - 89:42)
versus the Virtual Console where you (89:40 - 89:44)
actually purchase the game and now it&#39;s (89:42 - 89:45)
on your (89:44 - 89:48)
system because those games at least with (89:45 - 89:52)
the Virtual Console on the 3DS can still (89:48 - 89:54)
transfer those Pokemon to like Pokemon (89:52 - 89:56)
Bank and then you can then put them into (89:54 - 89:57)
your other Pokemon games right you can (89:56 - 89:59)
bring them up to Pokemon home and put (89:57 - 90:00)
them into scarlet and violet or sword (89:59 - 90:03)
and shield and if you have those games (90:00 - 90:05)
on a (90:03 - 90:07)
subscription the question then becomes (90:05 - 90:09)
what happens there so like if you stop (90:07 - 90:10)
paying the subscription you no longer (90:09 - 90:13)
have the game so then the Pokemon so can (90:10 - 90:14)
you get a bunch of Pokemon transfer them (90:13 - 90:17)
to home will it not have the home (90:14 - 90:19)
connectivity but then there here&#39;s (90:17 - 90:20)
another here&#39;s another scenario I don&#39;t (90:19 - 90:22)
think anyone talked (90:20 - 90:26)
about if if and Bobby are trading Bob (90:22 - 90:29)
Bob Bobby has Pokemon Crystal on the the (90:26 - 90:32)
Nintendo switch I have Pokemon Crystal (90:29 - 90:35)
on my Nintendo switch Bobby&#39;s like let (90:32 - 90:38)
me get uh let me get let me get that (90:35 - 90:41)
hoot hoot I&#39;m like hoot hoot Bobby I got (90:38 - 90:43)
I got you I got you the hoot hoot I (90:41 - 90:46)
trade Bobby the hoot hoot Bobby sends me (90:43 - 90:49)
a natu we&#39;re both bird and thus we love (90:46 - 90:51)
we love trading birds back in (90:49 - 90:55)
Crystal what if Bobby stop paying for (90:51 - 90:57)
Nintendo (90:55 - 91:00)
online and can no longer access the game (90:57 - 91:03)
that&#39;s understandable but me a loyal (91:00 - 91:07)
hardcore Nintendo fan Sony sucks love (91:03 - 91:10)
Nintendo will never not play online how (91:07 - 91:14)
am I supposed to get my hoot hoot (91:10 - 91:14)
back Bobby can&#39;t access his game that&#39;s (91:14 - 91:20)
my hoot hoot where but you do you see (91:17 - 91:22)
what I&#39;m saying though do you see what (91:20 - 91:24)
do you understand what I&#39;m saying I I (91:22 - 91:25)
guess but like I mean Pokemon bank if (91:24 - 91:26)
you don&#39;t if you don&#39;t pay for the (91:25 - 91:28)
subscription what happens there right (91:26 - 91:31)
they just sit uh you you can withdraw (91:28 - 91:33)
you can still you can&#39;t put any in if (91:31 - 91:35)
you stop paying for Pokemon bank or (91:33 - 91:36)
Pokemon home you can&#39;t put any in but (91:35 - 91:38)
you can still pull them all (91:36 - 91:40)
out okay yeah I don&#39;t but I can&#39;t I (91:38 - 91:42)
can&#39;t get my I can&#39;t get my hoot hoot (91:40 - 91:44)
back unless Bobby (91:42 - 91:48)
pays I yeah I don&#39;t know I again they (91:44 - 91:50)
could there&#39;s all kinds of things they (91:48 - 91:52)
could do but just as it currently works (91:50 - 91:54)
it would be weird to add those games I (91:52 - 91:56)
mean cuz it&#39;s Unique it&#39;s Unique in how (91:54 - 91:58)
Pokemon works and how those games work (91:56 - 92:00)
and that you can take the Pokemon out of (91:58 - 92:02)
the game and put them into other games (92:00 - 92:04)
right that&#39;s very that&#39;s like only (92:02 - 92:06)
Pokemon I think that that really works (92:04 - 92:08)
with I&#39;m sure there are other games that (92:06 - 92:11)
have some kind of feature that&#39;s temp (92:08 - 92:14)
fans sh their boots (92:11 - 92:17)
yeah but uh that is just uniquely (92:14 - 92:20)
different than any other game that is on (92:17 - 92:25)
the online subscription service yeah (92:20 - 92:27)
yeah no you make you make a good point I (92:25 - 92:30)
just want it so badly to happen I want a (92:27 - 92:33)
telling you I want a Lola the switch I (92:30 - 92:34)
mean every time this comes up I&#39;m like (92:33 - 92:36)
I&#39;ll pay full price I will pay full (92:34 - 92:38)
price and Reby every single one of those (92:36 - 92:40)
games I don&#39;t (92:38 - 92:44)
care I think I think there&#39;s there there (92:40 - 92:47)
there is a subscription issue of like (92:44 - 92:49)
paying that and that is a big difference (92:47 - 92:51)
between the Virtual Console and what we (92:49 - 92:55)
have now mhm when when you like I I (92:51 - 92:59)
Pokemon games are worth their (92:55 - 93:02)
value like main series Pokemon games (92:59 - 93:06)
Mystery Dungeon Pokemon Snap Stadium not (93:02 - 93:08)
not so (93:06 - 93:10)
much like there&#39;s not been a spin-off (93:08 - 93:14)
that even comes close to selling like 15 (93:10 - 93:17)
million like uh black and white and (93:14 - 93:18)
black and White&#39;s actually like the (93:17 - 93:20)
worst selling of the main Series games (93:18 - 93:22)
but (93:20 - 93:26)
like I don&#39;t know why game freak would (93:22 - 93:29)
want like I don&#39;t know what the the (93:26 - 93:31)
subscription cost cuts into right if (93:29 - 93:34)
you&#39;re paying $35 a (93:31 - 93:37)
year how many people are are going in (93:34 - 93:39)
getting Donkey Kong Jr how many people (93:37 - 93:41)
are going in getting uh sin and (93:39 - 93:43)
Punishment how many people are going in (93:41 - 93:46)
getting Mario Kart 64 how do those cuts (93:43 - 93:48)
happen for a Nintendo publishing game (93:46 - 93:50)
that doesn&#39;t (93:48 - 93:52)
matter because they&#39;re the publisher and (93:50 - 93:54)
the developer (93:52 - 93:56)
and so they can just take their entire (93:54 - 93:58)
cut from whatever that is but how does (93:56 - 94:02)
that work for game freak like yes right (93:58 - 94:04)
Nintendo published it but they should (94:02 - 94:06)
still get a cut as the developer just (94:04 - 94:08)
like if there was Sonic the Hedgehog (94:06 - 94:11)
Sega would still get their cut for that (94:08 - 94:14)
game existing whereas on Virtual Console (94:11 - 94:16)
that&#39;s much more clear even if it was (94:14 - 94:19)
like a Apple or Google situation of 3070 (94:16 - 94:22)
you sell a $10 version of Pokemon Red (94:19 - 94:25)
Nintendo gets $3 game freak gets $7 (94:22 - 94:27)
that&#39;s that&#39;s much (94:25 - 94:31)
harder on a subscription service and the (94:27 - 94:33)
other thing to keep in mind is when you (94:31 - 94:35)
looked at the bestselling Virtual (94:33 - 94:36)
Console (94:35 - 94:39)
games they were (94:36 - 94:42)
Pokemon right and so you bring Pokemon (94:39 - 94:44)
to a subscription (94:42 - 94:47)
service and who&#39;s how is that cut (94:44 - 94:49)
happening like yeah you maybe get more (94:47 - 94:52)
people to sign up for sure (94:49 - 94:55)
but like (94:52 - 94:57)
game freak would make more money outside (94:55 - 94:59)
of that Subscription Service being like (94:57 - 95:02)
here&#39;s Pokemon Red for 10 bucks and (94:59 - 95:05)
maybe they could do that is like here it (95:02 - 95:08)
is for 10 bucks but they also have to (95:05 - 95:10)
keep in mind the rewind feature like (95:08 - 95:12)
almost every single game has that rewind (95:10 - 95:13)
feature game freak doesn&#39;t want you to (95:12 - 95:17)
rewind right your Pokemon they have to (95:13 - 95:19)
keep in mind of some integration of (95:17 - 95:21)
Pokemon home or Pokemon bank which costs (95:19 - 95:24)
money and then I just look at like let&#39;s (95:21 - 95:26)
just look look at let&#39;s go Pikachu let&#39;s (95:24 - 95:27)
go Eevee that game (95:26 - 95:30)
sold 14 million (95:27 - 95:33)
copies and let&#39;s just say out of the 1.5 (95:30 - 95:36)
million copies of the six of them let&#39;s (95:33 - 95:37)
just say that red and blue sold 1 (95:36 - 95:39)
million (95:37 - 95:42)
copies remaking a game is a lot of work (95:39 - 95:44)
but selling 1 million copies at $10 or (95:42 - 95:47)
selling million copies at (95:44 - 95:49)
$60 (95:47 - 95:53)
yeah and like even look at bdsp 14 (95:49 - 95:56)
million copies at $60 like you it kind (95:53 - 95:59)
of is like well duh why would they put (95:56 - 96:03)
it on when they could just hold on to (95:59 - 96:06)
like milk people&#39;s Nostalgia for longer (96:03 - 96:08)
and then put it out for (96:06 - 96:12)
$60 repackaged again more work but but (96:08 - 96:15)
do you think people that are buying red (96:12 - 96:18)
and blue or yellow for (96:15 - 96:22)
$10 H are then not buying let&#39;s go (96:18 - 96:25)
Pikachu let&#39;s go Eevee they have gotten (96:22 - 96:29)
it at10 people who want to play old (96:25 - 96:31)
Pokemon games have downloaded Delta on (96:29 - 96:32)
their iPhone and they&#39;ve played their (96:31 - 96:34)
Pokemon Crystal for free and they they (96:32 - 96:36)
actually have no interest in giving this (96:34 - 96:39)
company money right I I honestly think (96:36 - 96:42)
like there are the hardcore poke Pokemon (96:39 - 96:43)
fans like me or like you Bobby that are (96:42 - 96:46)
like I want old Pokemon games but there (96:43 - 96:48)
I think the majority of people are like (96:46 - 96:50)
oh I&#39;ll just download Delta (96:48 - 96:55)
right and I got my fix right right yeah (96:50 - 96:57)
well I mean there is something to say (96:55 - 97:03)
for uh like my phone is always on me so (96:57 - 97:06)
my 3DS is not always on me so if like if (97:03 - 97:08)
there is a way if there would be a way (97:06 - 97:10)
for me to buy a Pokemon game that I (97:08 - 97:12)
could just open my phone and play that (97:10 - 97:15)
game like there&#39;s that like I can do (97:12 - 97:16)
that at any point in the day because I (97:15 - 97:19)
always have my phone with me versus you (97:16 - 97:21)
know if I carried my 3DS all the time (97:19 - 97:22)
you know or my switch all the time it&#39;d (97:21 - 97:24)
be one thing so like I but I do get it (97:22 - 97:26)
from that standpoint as well but yeah a (97:24 - 97:27)
little bit little bit different but can (97:26 - 97:31)
you use Street pass on your phone yeah (97:27 - 97:34)
bring back street pass I&#39;ll pay $10 for (97:31 - 97:36)
a street Pass App would you pay an (97:34 - 97:38)
annual subscription for Street pass on (97:36 - 97:40)
your phone you know I think Nintendo (97:38 - 97:43)
could do like a street pass (97:40 - 97:46)
app on the iPhone or the Android phone (97:43 - 97:48)
they really could they could do like you (97:46 - 97:50)
oh you passed by another iPhone here&#39;s a (97:48 - 97:53)
puzzle piece mhm I would pay for that (97:50 - 97:55)
would pay for that too it&#39;s such a cool (97:53 - 97:57)
thing yeah and like that&#39;s what I did at (97:55 - 98:00)
like a pack back in the day I would be (97:57 - 98:04)
in line for uh like a a panel or or to (98:00 - 98:06)
play a game and i&#39; would be like oh man (98:04 - 98:09)
I got like 10 Street passes let me let (98:06 - 98:11)
me collect all of these while I&#39;m (98:09 - 98:13)
waiting in line it was (98:11 - 98:15)
awesome speaking of what you can do (98:13 - 98:19)
while waiting in line uh I was right put (98:15 - 98:21)
it on my LinkedIn profile no I think (98:19 - 98:23)
anyone could have predicted this uh (98:21 - 98:26)
Pokemon pocket will be at Worlds be one (98:23 - 98:29)
of the first people to enjoy the uh (98:26 - 98:33)
experience of Pokemon pocket open packs (98:29 - 98:35)
experience unique digital finishes (98:33 - 98:36)
parallel effects and more these are a (98:35 - 98:39)
lot of buzzword you may even uh find an (98:36 - 98:42)
immersive Card wait hold on did somebody (98:39 - 98:44)
at Niantic write this if you&#39;re lucky (98:42 - 98:47)
trainers you may even find an immersive (98:44 - 98:50)
card featuring details that extend past (98:47 - 98:54)
traditional Pokemon TCG cards (98:50 - 98:55)
I added that if you&#39;re lucky trainers (98:54 - 98:59)
but still uh you will need to have a (98:55 - 99:00)
pass to the (98:59 - 99:03)
convention uh it will be on (99:00 - 99:07)
demo all days every day uh 8:00 a.m to 6 (99:03 - 99:09)

lets us have so that&#39;s cool yeah I I (99:20 - 99:28)
think it&#39;s uh pretty awesome I I am (99:25 - 99:32)
curious as to what they show off in the (99:28 - 99:34)
game or like what they like what you (99:32 - 99:36)
really get to do um I feel like that you (99:34 - 99:37)
know the trailers that we&#39;ve seen for (99:36 - 99:39)
the game kind of give you a pretty good (99:37 - 99:42)
idea of how the game&#39;s going to work but (99:39 - 99:45)
uh it will be nice to get people seeing (99:42 - 99:47)
how the game actually does work because (99:45 - 99:51)
you take a game like um Trading Card (99:47 - 99:52)
live and it&#39;s like yeah we all knew what (99:51 - 99:54)
it was supposed to do but you start (99:52 - 99:57)
playing it and you&#39;re like oh this is (99:54 - 99:58)
they didn&#39;t do this as well as we had (99:57 - 100:00)
hoped that they would you know so it&#39;ll (99:58 - 100:02)
it&#39;ll be cool to to get it in people&#39;s (100:00 - 100:05)
hands and uh let them see how it&#39;s (100:02 - 100:07)
actually going to work and then get some (100:05 - 100:09)
reviews from people who are there to to (100:07 - 100:12)
actually play (100:09 - 100:12)
it are are you excited for this Chris I (100:12 - 100:17)
I I I know you&#39;re obviously big Pokemon (100:15 - 100:19)
Pokemon go fan but like I don&#39;t know (100:17 - 100:24)
where your TCG uh loyalty lies um I I (100:19 - 100:27)
really like TCG a lot um it&#39;s just (100:24 - 100:29)
expensive and as somebody who&#39;s fallen (100:27 - 100:32)
down Magic the Gathering whole several (100:29 - 100:34)
times in my life um I&#39;m trying to hedge (100:32 - 100:37)
my my Pokemon TCG uh interest quite a (100:34 - 100:42)
bit so this appeals to me so much um I (100:37 - 100:44)
mean it&#39;s it distills the part that as (100:42 - 100:46)
somebody who does not play the game a (100:44 - 100:49)
whole lot really um it it distills it (100:46 - 100:50)
down to like exactly what I want which (100:49 - 100:51)
is like I want to look at the gorgeous (100:50 - 100:54)
art because the art has only got gotten (100:51 - 100:55)
better and better and better all the (100:54 - 100:59)
time the immersive card idea is so it&#39;s (100:55 - 101:00)
so (100:59 - 101:02)
good um I&#39;m just looking forward to it (101:00 - 101:04)
because it&#39;s kind of just like the app (101:02 - 101:08)
for the card appreciator more than and (101:04 - 101:09)
I&#39;m I&#39;m eager to see what sort of (101:08 - 101:12)
collection element there is too um but (101:09 - 101:14)
digital hits different than physical (101:12 - 101:17)
does right um so them doing like this (101:14 - 101:19)
exploratory immersive stuff which is (101:17 - 101:21)
mostly about the art from what I can (101:19 - 101:25)
tell um sounds so appealing to (101:21 - 101:27)
me (101:25 - 101:30)
yeah um some other things at Worlds uh (101:27 - 101:32)
they&#39;re going to be having a drone show (101:30 - 101:34)
called dazzling Skies the Pokemon play (101:32 - 101:36)
lab will there there&#39;s a Pokemon world&#39;s (101:34 - 101:40)
trainer Town those all open to the (101:36 - 101:42)
public you do not need a pass for that (101:40 - 101:44)
although I don&#39;t think anyone listening (101:42 - 101:45)
to this podcast being like I&#39;m going to (101:44 - 101:47)
Worlds but I don&#39;t have a pass I (101:45 - 101:50)
don&#39;t comment down below I don&#39;t think (101:47 - 101:53)
so uh if you have a badge there will be (101:50 - 101:55)
uh uh they will be playing Pokemon (101:53 - 101:58)
Horizons not sure what episodes uh there (101:55 - 101:59)
will be (101:58 - 102:02)
autographs uh there will be a collect (101:59 - 102:05)
and trade corner there will be a geni (102:02 - 102:09)
ball activity I don&#39;t know what that is (102:05 - 102:12)
uh geny bring gkey ball to 2024 World (102:09 - 102:14)
Championships make your own gkey ball a (102:12 - 102:17)
mud ball while learning about em (102:14 - 102:21)
bio remediation technology and how these (102:17 - 102:24)
mud balls clean water (102:21 - 102:29)
cool that must be that cool yeah I I I (102:24 - 102:30)
don&#39;t know I don&#39;t know what that is (102:29 - 102:32)
fully but I will report back on it there (102:30 - 102:35)
will be a world championship history (102:32 - 102:38)
museum there will be the Pokemon Center (102:35 - 102:40)
room there will be the (102:38 - 102:43)
TCG pocket demo there will be the (102:40 - 102:45)
Pokemon Trading Card Game illustration (102:43 - 102:48)
contest you&#39;ll see the top 100 there on (102:45 - 102:50)
display and then there will be side (102:48 - 102:53)
events so again I think a lot of this (102:50 - 102:55)
stuff would be announced in a Pokemon (102:53 - 102:56)
presents I think the red and blue would (102:55 - 102:57)
be announced in the Pokemon presents I (102:56 - 102:59)
think we would get a trailer of pocket (102:57 - 103:01)
in a Pokemon presents I think we would (102:59 - 103:02)
get the trainer (103:01 - 103:05)
bus in a Pokemon (103:02 - 103:08)
presents trainer tour trainer tour (103:05 - 103:11)
trainer tour yes in a Pikachu bus a (103:08 - 103:13)
Pikachu bus I&#39;m telling you the bus is (103:11 - 103:15)
the best part it&#39;s front of it&#39;s front (103:13 - 103:17)
of mind we just talked about it it&#39;s (103:15 - 103:18)
still front of M is that (103:17 - 103:21)
bus the bus would be the last thing I (103:18 - 103:23)
think they would talk about in a for (103:21 - 103:25)
sure like last thing 100% they would (103:23 - 103:28)
talk about would be the world (103:25 - 103:31)
championships in Pokemon go MH which (103:28 - 103:33)
Niantic has announced on their blog (103:31 - 103:35)

outfit which congrats to those winners (103:44 - 103:54)
sorry your outfit is not amazing (103:48 - 103:54)
it it&#39;s it&#39;s okay I guess it kind of (103:55 - 103:58)
looks like a budget Power Ranger with a (103:57 - 103:59)
snorkel (103:58 - 104:01)
[Laughter] (103:59 - 104:03)
mask you should have won last year is (104:01 - 104:04)
what I&#39;m saying you really should you (104:03 - 104:06)
dropped the ball trainers you should (104:04 - 104:08)
have won last year the outfits were way (104:06 - 104:10)
better you missed your (104:08 - 104:12)
opportunity I like the spin though the (104:10 - 104:16)
pose is nice MH yeah have you ever been (104:12 - 104:19)

Chris and you saw somebody with the (104:19 - 104:25)
championship trophy (104:22 - 104:27)
no because that would legitimately be (104:25 - 104:29)
cool it would be cool but it&#39;s it&#39;s so (104:27 - 104:32)
rare that I&#39;ve never seen it and uh (104:29 - 104:33)
maybe I&#39;m just not cool enough to raid (104:32 - 104:36)
with world champions yeah cuz you win a (104:33 - 104:37)
world championship and you play Pokemon (104:36 - 104:40)
go there&#39;s no way you&#39;re not running the (104:37 - 104:42)
your character holding the trophy oh (104:40 - 104:45)

there will be a white T-shirt with the (104:57 - 105:03)
Pikachu snorkel on it via code I&#39;m sure (104:59 - 105:04)
you don&#39;t have to watch stream I&#39;m sure (105:03 - 105:06)
that&#39;ll be on Twitter (105:04 - 105:08)
or Instagram or whatever I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll (105:06 - 105:10)
be easy to find if you are at Worlds you (105:08 - 105:12)
will get a blue (105:10 - 105:15)
shirt uh with the Pikachu on it via a (105:12 - 105:17)
scavenger (105:15 - 105:19)
hunt there&#39;s a new costume Pikachu (105:17 - 105:21)

with themed Pokemon like aeral vigaro (105:58 - 106:01)
Cresselia these are competitive Pokemon (106:00 - 106:05)
so that makes sense um right and raids (106:01 - 106:07)
will one star raids will have Pikachu (106:05 - 106:09)
main food three star raids lickit Tong (106:07 - 106:11)
stun fist diggers be three star raids (106:09 - 106:13)

but does not I hear you do a whole (106:53 - 106:56)
podcast about it yeah that&#39;s right (106:54 - 106:58)
that&#39;s right um but uh I I don&#39;t I&#39;m not (106:56 - 107:02)
big on GBL myself um there&#39;s not a lot (106:58 - 107:06)
going on here in my opinion for me (107:02 - 107:08)
personally I suppose I mean I you know (107:06 - 107:09)
he always wants some like they should (107:08 - 107:11)
there should be something in the wild (107:09 - 107:13)
encounters for for everybody right there (107:11 - 107:15)
should be (107:13 - 107:18)
something but I don&#39;t know the idea of (107:15 - 107:19)
battling in order to get like the (107:18 - 107:22)
research done does not jive with my (107:19 - 107:25)
brain (107:22 - 107:25)
yep (107:28 - 107:35)
$5 for one battle pass 25,000 Stardust (107:29 - 107:37)
you could maybe make the argument that (107:35 - 107:41)
they put a legendary in the event themed (107:37 - 107:45)
encounters because Cresselia is there (107:41 - 107:49)
yeah I I would be very (107:45 - 107:49)
surprised like I don&#39;t know I it&#39;s it&#39;s (107:50 - 107:55)
just the paid research in go is getting (107:54 - 107:58)
more and it&#39;s it was already (107:55 - 108:01)
frustrating for this but this seems like (107:58 - 108:03)
the worst (108:01 - 108:06)
one again I feel like we&#39;re a broken (108:03 - 108:08)
record but this is the world (108:06 - 108:10)
championships this is where everyone (108:08 - 108:13)
will be watching the best players in go (108:10 - 108:15)
the best players in TCG the best players (108:13 - 108:18)
in VGC it&#39;s an actual they&#39;ve done such (108:15 - 108:20)
the Pokemon company itself not n antic (108:18 - 108:22)
has done such a good job at making this (108:20 - 108:24)
like a celebration and making it (108:22 - 108:26)
something that you pay attention to (108:24 - 108:28)
there&#39;s usually some sort of (108:26 - 108:30)
announcement like last year&#39;s World they (108:28 - 108:32)
were like the starters are coming back (108:30 - 108:33)
which you could argue is like actually a (108:32 - 108:36)
competitive announcement because inant (108:33 - 108:40)
aora is coming back right like (108:36 - 108:40)
um why is it why are you paying this why (108:40 - 108:46)
is Niantic charging this much (108:43 - 108:50)
for what should be a celebration and (108:46 - 108:51)
should (108:50 - 108:55)
be it should be a dollar it should be it (108:51 - 108:57)
it should not be $5 that&#39;s true it (108:55 - 108:59)
should be cheaper there also is that (108:57 - 109:02)
like the idea that they&#39;re not putting a (108:59 - 109:06)
bunch of like stuff in it to make people (109:02 - 109:08)
feel like they need to buy it right so (109:06 - 109:11)
it&#39;s like it&#39;s like there&#39;s an there&#39;s (109:08 - 109:12)
extra to it and I think it should be (109:11 - 109:16)
cheaper for sure but it&#39;s also like if (109:12 - 109:18)
you don&#39;t buy it because it&#39;s this (109:16 - 109:20)
celebration event and stuff if you don&#39;t (109:18 - 109:21)
buy it you&#39;re not missing much because (109:20 - 109:24)
like the celebration is is like outside (109:21 - 109:28)
of that uh but I mean $5 for it just (109:24 - 109:29)
seem it just feels like you&#39;re not going (109:28 - 109:32)
to get many people buying it because (109:29 - 109:34)
there isn&#39;t much to it there isn&#39;t there (109:32 - 109:36)
isn&#39;t much that&#39;s going to make any (109:34 - 109:37)
people be like oh I need that you know I (109:36 - 109:40)
need to buy that for five bucks uh you (109:37 - 109:43)
know yeah there should be there should (109:40 - 109:45)
be if they were going to do to do this (109:43 - 109:46)
at the $5 doll amount I mean there is (109:45 - 109:48)
you could put enough value in there that (109:46 - 109:50)
it would be worthwhile it should be all (109:48 - 109:53)
this and much more it there should be (109:50 - 109:55)
bonuses for regular play so people that (109:53 - 109:57)
don&#39;t even battle can still get more out (109:55 - 109:59)
of the event even if even if the wild (109:57 - 110:01)
spawns are lackluster in their opinion (109:59 - 110:03)
like they are in mine right but also (110:01 - 110:05)
like give us like 30 encounters with the (110:03 - 110:07)
costume Pikachu in this (110:05 - 110:10)
ticket you know like people people love (110:07 - 110:13)
that I love that at bare minimum it (110:10 - 110:17)
should be five raid passes so even yes (110:13 - 110:19)
you&#39;re like it should (110:17 - 110:22)
be like I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a there&#39;s (110:19 - 110:24)
I you shouldn&#39;t pay you shouldn&#39;t have (110:22 - 110:26)
to pay for Pokemon I think that&#39;s and (110:24 - 110:28)
that&#39;s really weird in Pok√©mon go cuz (110:26 - 110:30)
people would be like $1 let&#39;s do the (110:28 - 110:32)
Mewtwo raid another dollar let&#39;s do the (110:30 - 110:34)
meu raid another dollar let&#39;s do a meu (110:32 - 110:36)
raid and that&#39;s like a weird line that (110:34 - 110:39)
Niantic has had to balance and it&#39;s (110:36 - 110:40)
probably part part of the reason why (110:39 - 110:42)
they increased raid passes so it (110:40 - 110:46)
wouldn&#39;t be like pull that slot machine (110:42 - 110:50)
lever but if I&#39;m I feel like the items (110:46 - 110:53)
themselves in a paid package should (110:50 - 110:55)
should be what you&#39;re paying for and (110:53 - 110:58)
then the Pokemon or the Stardust is like (110:55 - 111:02)
the extra yeah right that&#39;s I agree with (110:58 - 111:03)
that that&#39;s typically how it goes right (111:02 - 111:06)
like you&#39;ll see some it&#39;s a $5 ticket (111:03 - 111:08)
and you&#39;re going to get a pfin and (111:06 - 111:10)
you&#39;re going to get a rocket radar and (111:08 - 111:12)
you&#39;ll get two premium raid passes and a (111:10 - 111:13)
lot of people will be like well I&#39;ve (111:12 - 111:15)
never used those things so I I&#39;m not (111:13 - 111:17)
going to spend the money but for someone (111:15 - 111:19)
like me or maybe e you know any of us (111:17 - 111:21)
who use all those items it&#39;s like oh (111:19 - 111:23)
paying $5 for that is worth it because (111:21 - 111:24)
otherwise if I wanted to buy those (111:23 - 111:28)
separately it&#39;d be like $7 right so it (111:24 - 111:30)
is feeling like a bit of a discount (111:28 - 111:31)
because I would use those things and (111:30 - 111:33)
it&#39;s worth it whereas to your point (111:31 - 111:36)
Steve the only thing here is a RAID pass (111:33 - 111:39)
that would be a dollar you know and then (111:36 - 111:41)
it&#39;s like Stardust and Pokemon (111:39 - 111:44)
encounters that&#39;s very weird 25,000 (111:41 - 111:45)
Stardust is like isn&#39;t even worth (111:44 - 111:48)
mentioning in my opinion it&#39;s very (111:45 - 111:49)
little Stardust especially when you&#39;re (111:48 - 111:51)
talking about this in the context of (111:49 - 111:54)
battling which is notoriously Stardust (111:51 - 111:59)
hungry it&#39;s just notot a lot what do you (111:54 - 112:02)
yeah what do you think 100,000 100,000 (111:59 - 112:07)
100,000 for5 for $5 absolutely okay or (112:02 - 112:09)
maybe like 50 and then be like hey (112:07 - 112:12)
here&#39;s also a star piece you know and (112:09 - 112:13)
they they set that up for you to get (112:12 - 112:15)
more value out of it if you know about (112:13 - 112:17)
it know if you&#39;re in the know right the (112:15 - 112:21)
Nuance of go right right but I don&#39;t (112:17 - 112:23)
know it&#39;s like (112:21 - 112:25)
I&#39;m just saying I don&#39;t think it it (112:23 - 112:28)
appeals to a battler either right right (112:25 - 112:32)
yeah yeah I I I feel like (112:28 - 112:34)
somebody who has a lot of Stardust has a (112:32 - 112:36)
lot of Stardust and somebody who doesn&#39;t (112:34 - 112:37)
isn&#39;t going to just be like oh man I (112:36 - 112:40)
really need 25,000 in Stardust let me (112:37 - 112:42)
just drop $5 right now like I just don&#39;t (112:40 - 112:44)
think that&#39;s the thing again I think (112:42 - 112:46)
every every time there&#39;s a new paid (112:44 - 112:51)
research and you look at it I just think (112:46 - 112:53)
about Pokemon sleep and I think about (112:51 - 112:55)
how they&#39;re charging me $50 every 6 (112:53 - 112:58)
months which is $10 a month and I think (112:55 - 113:01)
why is Pok√©mon go not charging people (112:58 - 113:03)
$10 a month for a subscription that they (113:01 - 113:05)
can just sign up for and forget it and (113:03 - 113:08)
these things here would not be that big (113:05 - 113:10)
of a deal under a subscription because (113:08 - 113:12)
if this showed up under my subscription (113:10 - 113:15)
as like here&#39;s your one free battle pass (113:12 - 113:17)
for the month here&#39;s your 25,000 (113:15 - 113:19)
Stardust you get this research line for (113:17 - 113:22)
zumro vigoth Cresselia and I forget to (113:19 - 113:25)
do it I&#39;m like that&#39;s on me MH cuz I was (113:22 - 113:27)
just part of my subscription and I (113:25 - 113:29)
didn&#39;t do it and if if it comes up and (113:27 - 113:31)
I&#39;m like oh cool this is great this is (113:29 - 113:32)
exactly what I&#39;m paying for my (113:31 - 113:34)
subscription great let&#39;s do it and then (113:32 - 113:36)
if I&#39;m not a subscription member I look (113:34 - 113:37)
at this and I&#39;m like oh this month I can (113:36 - 113:39)
get this paid research and this paid (113:37 - 113:41)
research and this paid research and then (113:39 - 113:44)
I forget to cancel it for the next like (113:41 - 113:46)
it almost it just feels like if Niantic (113:44 - 113:48)
did a monthly (113:46 - 113:51)
membership it feels like it&#39;s a win-win (113:48 - 113:53)
it&#39;s a win-win for people who would sign (113:51 - 113:55)
up and not have to be nicked and dimed (113:53 - 113:58)
every other week in this game and it (113:55 - 114:00)
feels like a win for Niantic because (113:58 - 114:01)
half of those people will forget to (114:00 - 114:04)
cancel and they will get that money just (114:01 - 114:05)
like Netflix just like World of Warcraft (114:04 - 114:08)
just like HBO Max just like Prime video (114:05 - 114:10)
where you can watch Trainer Club not a (114:08 - 114:14)
sponsored ad uh trainer trainer just max (114:10 - 114:17)
it&#39;s not HBO Max come on oh my (114:14 - 114:21)
TR TR Pikachu bus the Pikachu bus it (114:17 - 114:23)
just it just feels like it&#39;s a win-win (114:21 - 114:26)
for both and it&#39;s shocking to me that (114:23 - 114:29)
Niantic has not released a monthly (114:26 - 114:32)
subscription yep agreed yeah we&#39;re not (114:29 - 114:34)
we&#39;re not great at managing Optics over (114:32 - 114:36)
in the ghost (114:34 - 114:39)
sphere uh like I I think you&#39;re right (114:36 - 114:40)
though like every single time that you (114:39 - 114:42)
see these tickets and like I I buy every (114:40 - 114:45)
ticket right and even if and I and I do (114:42 - 114:47)
I do right but like at least I get to (114:45 - 114:50)
say like oh my co-host is going to (114:47 - 114:52)
refuse to buy this ticket and I&#39;m going (114:50 - 114:54)
to buy this ticket because I love this (114:52 - 114:56)
game but also like if it&#39;s bad I like to (114:54 - 114:57)
be able to come back on the show the (114:56 - 115:00)
next week and be like yeah no we were (114:57 - 115:01)
right it was not worth the money and I (115:00 - 115:04)
can say that because I did it right yeah (115:01 - 115:05)
yeah um but (115:04 - 115:08)
like every time that you have to make (115:05 - 115:10)
that choice as a consumer you&#39;re you&#39;re (115:08 - 115:13)
literally looking at a $2 ticket two (115:10 - 115:15)
times a month or something like that (115:13 - 115:18)
like it feels bad and and how and how (115:15 - 115:20)
often do you want to willingly make your (115:18 - 115:22)
customers feel bad because they have to (115:20 - 115:24)
think about the money they&#39;re spending (115:22 - 115:26)
instead of office getting it in some way (115:24 - 115:27)
like you&#39;re like you&#39;re saying with like (115:26 - 115:29)
some sort of Subscription Service makes (115:27 - 115:30)
a lot of (115:29 - 115:33)
sense yeah I don&#39;t know we&#39;ve been (115:30 - 115:35)
saying this for (115:33 - 115:37)
years this podcast is going on for too (115:35 - 115:38)
long but there&#39;s like there&#39;s that thing (115:37 - 115:41)
of like buying it for like2 or5 and then (115:38 - 115:44)
something happening in life kid gets (115:41 - 115:47)
sick like you break your leg uh you&#39;re (115:44 - 115:49)
just having a bad mental health day and (115:47 - 115:52)
then you feel even worse that like I (115:49 - 115:54)
spent $5 on this I was planning on going (115:52 - 115:56)
out on Saturday to complete (115:54 - 116:00)
it uh something happened and now it&#39;s (115:56 - 116:03)
like this weird Panic of like I need to (116:00 - 116:05)
finish it before it ends otherwise it (116:03 - 116:06)
disappears and I don&#39;t have it and that (116:05 - 116:08)
just doesn&#39;t happen with a monthly (116:06 - 116:10)
subscription yeah you just it&#39;s just not (116:08 - 116:14)
the same thing mentally MH uh of like oh (116:10 - 116:15)
well I got all these other things this (116:14 - 116:17)
month I just couldn&#39;t finish this not (116:15 - 116:19)
that big of a deal whereas you&#39;re every (116:17 - 116:22)
week you have to be like oh this is new (116:19 - 116:24)
in the shop I buy it do I have time is (116:22 - 116:26)
it worth it it&#39;s like it&#39;s like a (116:24 - 116:30)
full-time job to manage Pok√©mon go (116:26 - 116:33)
research and their prices and stuff and (116:30 - 116:35)
I think all of that gets alleviated just (116:33 - 116:38)
with a monthly subscription like I don&#39;t (116:35 - 116:40)
think about like when I subscribed to (116:38 - 116:42)
Netflix I subscribed to Netflix like one (116:40 - 116:47)
or for one or two shows and as long as I (116:42 - 116:48)
turn it on like once a month I&#39;m like (116:47 - 116:50)
okay I use my Netflix like it&#39;s not like (116:48 - 116:52)
I need to watch this show this weekend (116:50 - 116:53)
and then this show show next weekend and (116:52 - 116:55)
I got to go back and rewatch this show (116:53 - 116:57)
otherwise I&#39;m not getting my value right (116:55 - 116:58)
and if I&#39;m not getting my value with (116:57 - 117:01)
Netflix like if I&#39;m You in September I (116:58 - 117:02)
don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be able to watch (117:01 - 117:04)
Netflix at all I&#39;m going to hit the (117:02 - 117:07)
cancel button and then I&#39;ll reup when I (117:04 - 117:09)
decide I need to (117:07 - 117:11)
watch something I there&#39;s nothing on (117:09 - 117:13)
Netflix to watch I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t (117:11 - 117:14)
know why I&#39;m paying for it now I got (117:13 - 117:15)
three more episodes of Pokemon Horizons (117:14 - 117:17)
and then I&#39;ll cancel yeah but but like (117:15 - 117:19)
that that you&#39;re in the head space then (117:17 - 117:21)
like you&#39;re not paying for to watch a (117:19 - 117:22)
particular show you&#39;re paying for the (117:21 - 117:25)
option to watch that show whether or not (117:22 - 117:27)
you you choose to or not that&#39;s still (117:25 - 117:30)
your choice and you&#39;re buying that right (117:27 - 117:33)
and yeah it should apply here it really (117:30 - 117:36)
should yep totally um the other thing (117:33 - 117:40)
that they would maybe announce at Worlds (117:36 - 117:44)
is Dynamax and gen 8 we saw that that (117:40 - 117:47)
has added been added to the game uh (117:44 - 117:51)
we&#39;ll end on this Chris do you have (117:47 - 117:55)
any you what do you think&#39;s happening oh (117:51 - 117:58)
uh man I honestly I think that um either (117:55 - 118:00)
we won&#39;t hear about it and then they&#39;ll (117:58 - 118:02)
be saving it for go Fest season um next (118:00 - 118:05)
year um or we will hear about it soon (118:02 - 118:07)
and we&#39;ll see it before that and I think (118:05 - 118:10)
those are really the only two options (118:07 - 118:11)
like we&#39;re either getting it at the end (118:10 - 118:13)
of August or it&#39;s going to disappear for (118:11 - 118:15)
a while yeah that that&#39;s my that&#39;s my (118:13 - 118:17)
take on it and I I don&#39;t think it&#39;s (118:15 - 118:19)
going to be much more complicated than (118:17 - 118:20)
than a Mega (118:19 - 118:24)
System these these Pokemon pages are (118:20 - 118:27)
getting real clogged up especially if (118:24 - 118:29)
they&#39;re like Charizard or something like (118:27 - 118:31)
that like it&#39;s going to be a mess with (118:29 - 118:33)
the buttons and all the different types (118:31 - 118:35)
of resources you have all on those pages (118:33 - 118:37)
I think we actually might be in I I (118:35 - 118:39)
would love for them to do like a UI (118:37 - 118:42)
redesign in light of that stuff it&#39;s (118:39 - 118:43)
it&#39;s almost necessary yeah I mean the (118:42 - 118:45)
character design won&#39;t really redesign (118:43 - 118:47)
well really well a lot of (118:45 - 118:50)
[Laughter] (118:47 - 118:52)
people so (118:50 - 118:55)
okay I was thinking about the Dynamax (118:52 - 118:57)
gigantamax stuff and I know that there&#39;s (118:55 - 118:59)
like there&#39;s been the interviews where (118:57 - 119:01)
they&#39;re talking about wanting to bring (118:59 - 119:03)
Galler back but they want to do it (119:01 - 119:05)
correct right and they want to make sure (119:03 - 119:06)
that it&#39;s themed correctly and (119:05 - 119:10)
everything and obviously adding d d (119:06 - 119:13)
Dynamax and gigantamax along with int (119:10 - 119:15)
reintroducing Galler stuff would kind of (119:13 - 119:20)
make sense and so we also know that they (119:15 - 119:23)
have not announced with the Community (119:20 - 119:25)
Day classic is that&#39;s going to be (119:23 - 119:26)
happening during World right we know (119:25 - 119:27)
there is a Community Day classic but (119:26 - 119:29)
Niantic has not announced what Pokemon (119:27 - 119:31)
is going to be part of that Community (119:29 - 119:32)
Day classic a sore subject (119:31 - 119:36)
Bobby real so I&#39;m going a little tin hat (119:32 - 119:41)
here but okay my thought was if they (119:36 - 119:43)
wanted to do a Dynamax or gigantamax (119:41 - 119:46)
introduction and use a Pokemon that (119:43 - 119:48)
would also be a Community Day classic (119:46 - 119:50)
Pokemon like a Pikachu or a Gastly that (119:48 - 119:53)
becomes Gengar that can gigantamax M (119:50 - 119:57)
they might hold off on doing an (119:53 - 120:00)
announcement of who that is until they (119:57 - 120:02)
are like here&#39;s the full deal we have (120:00 - 120:05)
Dynamax or gigantamax coming and it&#39;s (120:02 - 120:07)
going to be introduced here and here&#39;s a (120:05 - 120:08)
Community Day classic of a Pokemon and (120:07 - 120:09)
then the community classic could be (120:08 - 120:11)
announced afterwards it&#39;s a gasly or (120:09 - 120:13)
Pikachu but they make their announcement (120:11 - 120:16)
of like Dynamax gigantamax first and (120:13 - 120:17)
that was another thing I was thinking (120:16 - 120:19)
they could announce in like a present if (120:17 - 120:21)
they did a present before worlds and (120:19 - 120:23)
actually talked about that in way and (120:21 - 120:26)
then Niantic did an announcement as well (120:23 - 120:27)
and then the community classic happens (120:26 - 120:30)
to be a Pokemon that would work with the (120:27 - 120:32)
gigantamax in some way that was kind of (120:30 - 120:34)
my thought as to why things like that (120:32 - 120:36)
haven&#39;t been kind of announced yet and (120:34 - 120:38)
we&#39;re seeing this stuff creep in to the (120:36 - 120:40)
game now so do do you think that they&#39;ll (120:38 - 120:43)
do kind of what they did with mega it&#39;s (120:40 - 120:44)
it&#39;s difficult with Dynamax right (120:43 - 120:46)
because you can Dynamax anything right (120:44 - 120:47)
um but but can&#39;t do you think that (120:46 - 120:50)
they&#39;ll do incremental releases like (120:47 - 120:53)
they did with with Megas yeah you like (120:50 - 120:56)
they&#39;ll do one at a time Mega Kingler (120:53 - 120:59)
for the month of or or gigantamax (120:56 - 121:01)
Kingler for the month of October and (120:59 - 121:04)
then gigantamax Machamp for the m month (121:01 - 121:05)
of so right I think they would do that (121:04 - 121:08)
with a gigantamax Pokemon I don&#39;t really (121:05 - 121:10)
know how it work with the Dynamax side (121:08 - 121:11)
of things I think they would kind of do (121:10 - 121:14)
it in in groups like they did with um (121:11 - 121:16)
XXL and xxs like for a while we had (121:14 - 121:19)
Hound hour and something else um there&#39;s (121:16 - 121:21)
like there was like four or five Pokemon (121:19 - 121:23)
that they did at first and they did (121:21 - 121:25)
different groups here&#39;s what I don&#39;t get (121:23 - 121:28)
maybe raids currently are already (121:25 - 121:31)
Dynamax Pokemon yeah they&#39;re just (121:28 - 121:33)
they&#39;re just big Pokemon and when you (121:31 - 121:35)
defeat them they get small that&#39;s (121:33 - 121:38)
exactly what Dynamax has always been (121:35 - 121:41)
yeah that is true that is true so I (121:38 - 121:44)
don&#39;t so like gigantamax makes sense in (121:41 - 121:46)
this like you just make those Mega raids (121:44 - 121:48)
right they&#39;re just ultimately Mega raids (121:46 - 121:50)
because they look different and then (121:48 - 121:52)
they&#39;re very big and then you defeat (121:50 - 121:54)
them and then they get small that&#39;s it (121:52 - 121:56)
that&#39;s that&#39;s again that&#39;s how it works (121:54 - 122:00)
so seeing that there was like a Dynamax (121:56 - 122:01)
gym being (122:00 - 122:06)
added I don&#39;t know how a Dynamax Hound (122:01 - 122:09)
Doom would be different than a regular (122:06 - 122:11)
Houndoom because they would both be (122:09 - 122:12)
Houndoom and then they would both get (122:11 - 122:15)
small when you defeat it unless there (122:12 - 122:18)
was a mechanic yeah they got the clouds (122:15 - 122:19)
around their head CLS exactly they add (122:18 - 122:22)
the clouds the unless you add a mechanic (122:19 - 122:24)
like Shadow raids where you have the (122:22 - 122:28)
purified gems so like does do they want (122:24 - 122:31)
us to collect like Dynamax energy to (122:28 - 122:34)
then do the Dynamax raids but then when (122:31 - 122:37)
you defeat just example Houndoom what do (122:34 - 122:39)
you getting that&#39;s (122:37 - 122:42)
different than what a normal Hound Doom (122:39 - 122:44)
raid would be like when you&#39;re defeating (122:42 - 122:46)
a gigantamax Pokemon like a gigantamax (122:44 - 122:50)
me uh Gengar ideally you&#39;re getting (122:46 - 122:53)
energy and a chance for that to be shiny (122:50 - 122:55)
and whatever just like (122:53 - 122:58)
megas so I&#39;m not sure what the the (122:55 - 123:01)
difference is well there&#39;s a difference (122:58 - 123:03)
in that at least with how it was (123:01 - 123:06)
originally introduced back in sword and (123:03 - 123:08)
shield only certain Pokemon could be (123:06 - 123:11)
gigantamax mhm right so it&#39;s not like (123:08 - 123:14)
every Gastly or every Gengar you had (123:11 - 123:17)
could gigantamax whereas with like Mega (123:14 - 123:20)
Evolution as long as you have a Lucario (123:17 - 123:22)
you could Mega Evolve that Lucario so (123:20 - 123:24)
like they could they could have it to (123:22 - 123:26)
where like you&#39;re doing these (123:24 - 123:28)
specifically to get one that can (123:26 - 123:30)
gigantamax or one that you know can do (123:28 - 123:32)
this so it&#39;s I feel like it&#39; be a little (123:30 - 123:36)
bit it&#39;s a little bit different than um (123:32 - 123:39)
how it works with like Mega (123:36 - 123:41)
Evolution (123:39 - 123:43)
yeah I I think if they wanted to make it (123:41 - 123:45)
really smooth they could just have it (123:43 - 123:47)
that every single regular raid is now (123:45 - 123:49)
just that&#39;s they&#39;re all Dynamax right (123:47 - 123:51)
and every single time you do a raid then (123:49 - 123:53)
you get like a generic Dynamax energy (123:51 - 123:55)
and then like you were saying Bobby with (123:53 - 123:58)
with gigantamax those those raids would (123:55 - 124:00)
be treated like Mega raids right and (123:58 - 124:02)
then they be different um and you get a (124:00 - 124:04)
different resource in order to (124:02 - 124:07)
gigantamax them or that species right (124:04 - 124:09)
right yeah yeah I think that&#39;s right (124:07 - 124:12)
that would make the most sense I (124:09 - 124:14)
think but it&#39;s introducing two new (124:12 - 124:16)
resources to a game that&#39;s already (124:14 - 124:20)
pretty Laden with them like there&#39;s a (124:16 - 124:22)
lot yeah yeah that is true (124:20 - 124:24)
you can just get some Dynamax (124:22 - 124:28)
energy one raid pass and one raid pass (124:24 - 124:31)
and one encounter with a Gastly five (124:28 - 124:34)
Stardust Perfect all right well that&#39;s (124:31 - 124:36)
that&#39;s our episode for you guys uh there (124:34 - 124:39)
will be one more episode before uh I (124:36 - 124:41)
head to (124:39 - 124:44)
Worlds and (124:41 - 124:47)
then I I I think I will be recording at (124:44 - 124:49)
Worlds and then getting an episode up (124:47 - 124:51)
that that Monday morning before I leave (124:49 - 124:52)
haw (124:51 - 124:55)
so um I did want to say one thing about (124:52 - 124:58)
worlds because we were talking about (124:55 - 125:00)
like there&#39;s like the free to the free (124:58 - 125:02)
to public free to the public events and (125:00 - 125:03)
we were talking about like well if (125:02 - 125:05)
you&#39;re at Worlds you probably have a (125:03 - 125:08)
pass however as someone who lives a mile (125:05 - 125:10)
away from where Comic-Con happens every (125:08 - 125:12)
year I don&#39;t get passes to Comic-Con (125:10 - 125:14)
every year but there are plenty of (125:12 - 125:17)
events at ComiCon for the public to go (125:14 - 125:19)
to that don&#39;t need a pass and I think (125:17 - 125:21)
that same thing may work with worlds (125:19 - 125:24)
right so if you do live near where world (125:21 - 125:28)
is happening um it does give a reason to (125:24 - 125:30)
possibly go down there and check things (125:28 - 125:33)
out even if you don&#39;t have a pass to (125:30 - 125:35)
Worlds since there are events that would (125:33 - 125:39)
be open to the public so there is that (125:35 - 125:41)
like people may not be going to Worlds (125:39 - 125:43)
but if you&#39;re in the area it does (125:41 - 125:46)
potentially give you something to do if (125:43 - 125:48)
you don&#39;t have a pass to Two (125:46 - 125:53)
Worlds uh also when Niantic makes (125:48 - 125:56)
temporary gyms uh usually those cannot (125:53 - 125:59)
be you can&#39;t like invite people to those (125:56 - 126:00)
this was a thing that happened in (125:59 - 126:04)
Yokohama and in London the gyms inside (126:00 - 126:07)
the stadium I could not invite people to (126:04 - 126:11)
I had to find gyms that existed normally (126:07 - 126:13)
uh same thing happened in Madrid as well (126:11 - 126:15)
like Niantic added a bunch of gyms and (126:13 - 126:17)
then I was like I can&#39;t invite you to (126:15 - 126:20)
this necrozma because it&#39;s this this is (126:17 - 126:22)
a temporary gym I I I don&#39;t if they&#39;ll (126:20 - 126:25)
ever fix that or whatnot but just a (126:22 - 126:27)
heads up if you&#39;re trying to raid (126:25 - 126:29)
Pikachu that weekend because you want a (126:27 - 126:32)
shiny scuba Pikachu um and it gives you (126:29 - 126:35)
a weird error it&#39;s because the person (126:32 - 126:38)
inviting you can&#39;t use that gym that&#39;s (126:35 - 126:41)
not your fault that is their fault they (126:38 - 126:44)
that is on them they need to go to a (126:41 - 126:47)
different gym and invite uh people so (126:44 - 126:49)
yeah there was a weird there&#39;s a weird (126:47 - 126:51)
Geo fence around worlds it might be (126:49 - 126:52)
different this year but at least the (126:51 - 126:55)
last couple worlds where um like my (126:52 - 126:58)
hotel last year (126:55 - 127:01)
was next to the convention center and I (126:58 - 127:03)
couldn&#39;t see any of the spawns or the (127:01 - 127:04)
any of the gyms and literally when I (127:03 - 127:07)
left my hotel and walked 30 seconds over (127:04 - 127:10)
it all spawned in where there was like (127:07 - 127:12)
seven gyms and all the Pok√© stops and (127:10 - 127:15)
then spawns everywhere and as soon as I (127:12 - 127:18)
walked out it all disappeared again and (127:15 - 127:20)
the Seven gemms that were in there I (127:18 - 127:21)
couldn&#39;t I couldn&#39;t invite people but (127:20 - 127:23)
like if I walked past the convention (127:21 - 127:26)
center into the park all of that was (127:23 - 127:29)
still spawns and stuff but those were (127:26 - 127:32)
gyms already existing there and they (127:29 - 127:34)
worked fine so it wasn&#39;t ticket based it (127:32 - 127:38)
was just it was a Geo it was a GE B yeah (127:34 - 127:40)
interesting okay yeah there was like no (127:38 - 127:45)
there was like no ticket to that I don&#39;t (127:40 - 127:45)
remember but (127:45 - 127:50)
