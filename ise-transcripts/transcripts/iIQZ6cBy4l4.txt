[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 447th episode of the pokemon podcast it's super effective i'm your host sbj with me is will i'm i just have to announce you caught me off guard i'm starting a new twitch program it's going to become the next hit uh i will only do it on thursday night so i won't steal any of your viewers but i am going to buy a case of faberge eggs and everybody can give me a million dollars per egg i will open the egg for you and tell you what's inside and then that's your egg it's a killer idea isn't it it no i mean yes and as long as i can be on stream uh collecting the funds and i will definitely put them through the right bank account greg also here i am also here i am also done with my first draft of my new pokemon rpg rules very happy now i just need to find an ounce of free time to actually play them which i don't have all right i agreed me too well we have uh quite a bit of news to cover here we are recording one day early recording on a saturday instead of a sunday because i'm busy tomorrow catching all the cuties i don't think any i shouldn't say that i said i don't think any dramatic pokemon news is gonna drop on a saturday night but i don't know japan sometimes they have no bounds and then we are about when this episode comes up we're like two episodes away from pokemon day so we'll see if any new games get announced or shirts or clothing or any other brand deals that pokemon wants to do this year they're doing quite a bit uh which we're going to talk about before we begin happy black history month the pokemon company did tweet today for the first time ever in history uh happy black history month and i believe they are featuring black cop black pokemon cosplayers uh every single day on their twitter um and they started today with a black leon cosplayer so that is new obviously the social media team at the pokemon company international really breaking down walls over there i would say that like five years ago their twitter was the most boring sterile corporate thing in the world yup now i feel like most people look forward to the tweets that the social media team is doing over at tcpi so good for them let's start off what's our best news this week um probably the person that got arrested for selling hacked pokemon we'll say heck yeah yeah i'm into it we got a good one yeah we gotta save that to that one uh let's start off with some uh lighter news here [Music] netflix's of pokemon journeys is ending but but but that actually means that that season is ending i feel like all these articles are clickbaity to think like oh are they done um but japan is already on the second season of journeys but i'm sure that it's going to be named differently here but on march 5th to 2021 it will be the last they're doing 12 episodes right so it'll be the last 12 episodes yeah and then um then we don't know uh i would assume that they'll probably show or preview something around the time but i believe that these are doing pretty well on netflix so i don't see why i don't know i don't know where else pokemon would go like i don't know if they would be like oh we're starting the second season on disney plus or like i think they're probably pretty okay with netflix and the only reason i say that is because i have so i have another article here from cbr.com pokemon is still powering american anime fandom according to netflix according to netflix's 2020 year in review the streaming service and uh the streaming services anime viewership has grown 100 in the last year and pokemon the movie strikes back evolution was one of the most viewed viewed animes of the year pokemon the movie strikes back that wasn't the name of the movie pokemon youtube strikes back evolution okay you left out a word what word did i leave out mewtwo oh my pokemon destroys back evolution yeah pokemon the movie strikes back and i'm like what movie mewtwo that movie is real weird animation wise wasn't it done like uh with like kind of 3d style uh what is the computer animation cgi yeah i'm behind on the pokemon anime i have to catch up yeah i needed this news three hours ago when i finished watching the card fight vanguard anime and i mean i've literally now have watched every single episode of that anime that has ever come out while i was at the gym and i was like boy i need a new anime to start watching while i'm at the gym i need something that's not going to be offensive to the people standing behind me and because you weren't there to tell me remind me to watch pokemon i started up attack on titan again well there you go i feel like that would get you the looks that would get you the looks exactly i make bad choices without input from other people why did you text i don't text while i'm at the gym what why are you at the gym then exercise look at cute guys oh i know but see then you're you need to be taking pictures and sending those pictures that is no no no yes oh no i am not that guy i am not that guy no that is dude we talked about this last week uh but i guess we'll bring it up again because it's starting soon mcdonald's happy meal offer mcdonald's happy meal offers pokemon cards in celebration of 25 and the 25th anniversary i believe this book begins on february 9th wait it goes from february 9th until when yeah i have the article here from hypebeast this pokemon mcdonald's promotion is rumored to launch february launched in february the set is to feature 25 cards consisting of pokemon starters throughout various series fans uh have a chance of getting pikachu who is a starter in yellow thanks hypebeast for the most boring overlay a supposed mcdonald's manager named uh mj revealed that the happy meal set is to come with four card booster packs each pack will reportedly contain four different starter pokemon one which will be hollow the other three non-hollow that means that the 25 cards will be available both as hollow and non-holo bringing the card total up to fifty dollars or up to 50 total the pokemon company has yet to reveal any promotional details about this however mcdonald's has already began advertising pokey beach has confirmed that the booster packs will be sold separately mcdonald's so i could just like buy it at mcdonald's yes mcdonald's happy meal and pokemon trading card promotion will reportedly take reportedly take place on february 9th and onwards across uh select locations in the nation i think they always have to say select right because yes yeah yeah because there's to be like a mcdonald's in like martha texas that is just not they didn't get their shipment yep well i have two comments on this number one we're obviously going to mcdonald's when you come to visit me and greg and getting cards yes and uh assuming that cards will not be sold out i was just going to say and number two there's no way we're going to get cards because people are going to go nuts and mcdonald's pokemon cards thinking that they're striking it rich well the question now is like how much is a happy meal because you can just buy you could just buy the happy meal toy by itself how much is happy meal toy well i mean happy meals the cost of a happy meal varies by where you are i mean in new york city a happy meal cost you 23 25 to 30 dollars in you know i don't know pueblo colorado it's like they actually give you money please take these happy meals off our hands we have so many well if you can buy the cards separately it's a four pack okay so uh this person on reddit said they worked at mcdonald's and the toys themselves cost a dollar sixty nine so if you just went through the drive through oh this person says at my mcdonald's we charge a dollar ninety nine and then this other person said at my mcdonald's they cost a dollar seventy i guess that makes sense because sometimes if you go to like the real like shady mcdonald's their sauce cups are like more it's like 75 cents instead of 50 cents for like barbecue sauce and then other mcdonald's they were like oh we don't even charge for sauce here you go is that franchise life yep so do we even know what these cards are pikachu and then the other starters that's all like what makes them worth this money oh they're not good um so nothing oh here's mike all the time expensive they're also not good they're just charizard how much how many cards are in a regular pack of pokemon cards 10. you get 10 cards and that's usually dollars and fifty cents unless you do sbj gymnastics of going in with somebody and buying packs and blah blah blah did you watch my youtube video will no i don't the only thing i watch on youtube yeah you watch people who steal other people's tick tocks put them on youtube i understand unless your youtube tick tocks have shirtless guys doing the rasputin dance that's not coming up on my youtube queue here's the thing so they're worth two dollars then four cards for two dollars is is is pretty much the rate but you can go to the dollar tree and get a dollar booster pack for a dollar you can't get pokemon cards at a dollar tree yeah you can they're they're it's a three pack oh i mean not since the last time i was at a dollar tree which was probably about a decade ago i just opened dollar tree booster packs on my stream i pulled the ice qv are you streaming tic tocs no then you're not getting my computer video time sorry bud sorry okay so if i if you could go to a dollar tree or a family dollar or a five below dollars rs yeah we should start dollars rs we could you can get three cards in a dollar pack but you're not guaranteed a rare you're not even guaranteed a reverse holo you could get three commons you get two commons one uncommon you can get two commons one reverse holo you get two one common one uncommon and then like a a secret rare like you can get good cards in a dollar pack it's just they don't have set odds like who who makes these packs the pokemon company they're official packs they're official packs they're legit official packs are we sure it's not like a no no it's 100 percent going to target and pulling out a pack and rip it open and resealing it because i believe you have been bitten by the reseal i have been bitten by the resale but the dollar packs you can get a dollar tree and and family dollar and dollars are us uh their official packs they even talk about it on support.pokemon.com and i believe they're just more targeted towards like low income slash younger children and i've heard a lot of parents like to get the dollar packs because one they're cheaper and two like they're they're good like reinforcement rewards for their kids they're like oh if you get all your homework done here you get your pack of pokemon cards but it's only a dollar pack yeah it's a really inexpensive way to get your children into gambling correct greg yes if you do everything you get to gamble maybe you'll get something you want that's life it's full of disappointment so you can work hard and still not get what you're looking for so life lessons abound so i'm assuming that the mcdonald's packs are going to be whatever mcdonald's sets it at so if mcdonald's is charging on 199 for a toy i'm assuming the pack would be 1.99 if your mcdonald's in i don't know hawaii is charging 169 i would assume that the pack of cards is one of those oh no trust the mcdonald's in hawaii is charging 40 yes they are you got to bring all that stuff in on the boat dude the question is is the current tcg fad which i covered on youtube like i said i was and that video is is literally one of the best videos i've put out on youtube since i've started my very mediocre youtube career that video is doing really well and it pretty much shows why we talked about this last week but i have but this i have visuals on the youtube why people care about pokemon cards why pokemon cards are so hard to find and what's happening with pokemon cards so the question is now that these mcdonald's cards are about to come out in uh tuesday yeah are they just going to be instantly sold out which like my thought processes i would like to collect all 50 cards that would be cool i would then probably have to buy i don't even know how many packs all right like you could so there's 25 hollows but they come with four but only one can be hollow so at bare minimum you would have to buy 25 packs but the likelihood of you you would probably be more likely to find a one in 8 thousand shiny in pokemon platinum then you would buy 25 packs and have every single holo be different wait so do you it's it's it's 25 cards which can either be hollow or not hollow so it's not 50 cards that you need you want 25 hollow cards and you're going to toss the non-hollow ones no uh it's going to be way easier to collect the 25 non-hollow because you're getting three non honestly going to say that you want the non-hollow cards when you're willing to put forth the effort to get all of the hollow cards no i'm gonna have so many non-hollow duplicates that i'll just give them to people and i'll keep one of each of the non-hollow that's easy to collect yes so i don't want to be i don't want to be that guy that goes to the i'm going to be that guy i'm going to go i'm going to go to mcdonald's drive through i'm going to say can i get 25 booster packs they're going to give me a weird look but i also don't want to buy 25 happy meals or eat at mcdonald's that often you eat them because that often now yeah but i'm like the dollar menu kind of guy like give me the picture give me the mcchicken no lettuce the mcdouble just ketchup and mustard medium fry thank you oh god everything about that sutton made me sick yeah it's it's a whole other way of living it's just we're not in that world god what's gonna happen is you're gonna get 25 packs and then you're gonna get 10 holo charmeleons yeah and then 15 assorted yeah i know and then but because pokemon cards are so hot right now that's probably not going to happen because probably the car in front of me is going to say how many happy meal pokemon cards do you have and they're going to say i don't know we got like 200 and they're going to be like i'll buy them all no what they're going to do is they're going to say limit five per customer there's no way north avenue in milwaukee wisconsin is going to care about limiting any sort of pokemon cards they're going to be like oh you want them all cool let me remember mcdonald's and you're right you are correct these people do not get paid enough to care or to argue with the customers about how many happy meals they want to buy well because they're not buying happy meals they're just buying packs yeah i mean mcdonald's has done other things that people wanted to like i'm sure there are barbie fans out there when mcdonald's has a new barbie line they're like i need give sell me all the barbie stuff please i'm just like what a huge waste of money because they're not gonna even be good cards that you wouldn't even put in a real deck there might be one that was good there was some mcdonald's um oh gosh i think it was a mcdonald's bulbasaur that was really good at one point it was either bulbasaur squirtle it was never charmander remainder was always bad so where do these fall in the whole phase them out timeline like is there a point are mcdonald's cards always valid and they will never phase out or no they're no no no they rotate they rotate these these cards will be in rotation for probably three years the question is like is there going to be playable blastoise venusaurs the blazikens like are are there going to be playable versions that will make you needing to use the base mcdonald's version in a deck probably not but like i said there was like a i can't remember if it was like venusaur genesect or if it was like a blastoise keldeo but one of the mcdonald's starters were it had like 10 more hp than the other like squirtles and so like the mcdonald's squirtle was like the preferred squirtle because it was like it had slightly more health slightly more survivability yeah so and mcdonald's cars normally hold their price like i think those squirtles were like six dollars each but yeah if it's like a snivy that no one's playing it's probably gonna be like a 15 cent card but i don't think the uh i don't think the tcg phases uh the phase we're going through is ending anytime soon no well maybe soon but just not at this moment yeah maybe when battle styles comes out people will be less excited but that's not until march well since it won't have a charizard or a pikachu yes yeah no charizard nor pikachu i think the best card in battle styles is like a secret rare hershey food card and there's no way like the uh hershey food just doesn't hold a candle to charizard or pikachu it's not a gen 1 pokemon dude okay more crossovers uh this is off um polygon uh levi's selling full on misty cosplay in a new pokemon fashion line the pokemon company and levi strat estrellas strauss i didn't know levi's had us of um because you didn't grow up in the 80s and co yes yeah they announced a new clothing line in commemoration of the pokemon 25th anniversary the line is inspired by the original anime and features all your first gen favorites it will be available in the united states starting on february 15th at levi's stores levi.com and the levi app prices range from 20 to 148 dollars uh the line is not very subtle but it is fun there is a guarded inspired jacket covered with various pokemon like slowpoke gengar mewtwo um it is a heck of a joke it's a lot it's a lot in the line with uh in the line with other boulder clothing options you can buy a pair of jeans with pikachu on it also um a lot yep fans are excited to see levi's is selling a version of misty's denim shorts which are just mostly high waisted denim shorts with suspenders other accessories include an ash ketchum inspired hat a pikachu with a pikachu beanie with ears yeah i mean you can just google like pokemon cross levi's and you can see pretty much all this clothing it's not great i don't know i kind of like that pikachu denim jacket oh the one's a big pizza on the back yeah that's the only one i sort of like i kind of like the hoodie with the snorlax and the gengar and the pikachu and the uh is that psyduck and jigglypuff yeah the whole denim thing i know exactly where the levi's story is in the mall of america i could like yeah i don't even need directions i'm just like psychically tied i mean i really want to like the garden jacket i want to go to the pants but i can't no i can't but maybe yes but no the garden yes that garden jacket is like it's so much for for me it's like i see like a korean dude and i'm like man i was thinking the same thing because korean people just have the best fashion yes yes so like i see like a korean dude and i'm like oh man i love his hair i love his style and then i like try to mimic it and i'm like i look like an absolute you look like a fool you you do you look like a fool you you cannot un-ironically pull that off right see the secret that i i will reveal this to you the fundamental secret of korean fashion and why it looks so good is the backdrop of seoul being such an amazing and beautiful city yeah that you can wear cool funky clothes there you can't do that in any city that starts with and i'm sorry just any city that starts with adam no no yeah this is i mean i mean one one i am gravely disappointed that levi strauss is a gen warner yeah come on i mean they know their target market i kind of want somebody to get me those pants for my birthday though okay when's your birthday again it's coming up i know it's just i look at like this black hoodie which just has a pikachu just literally just stamped a pikachu on the front and it should look so lazy wow i mean it's got but it's dessert too yeah well the black that's not a hoodie bud that's just a regular sweat sorry yeah the sweater sweatshirt it's a sweatshirt i like it because it doesn't have a hood but the big pokemon on the back and the thing in the front i mean i mean so they have a closer picture it looks like the the pikachu in the front is slightly raised which just presents cleaning problems it's like the when we used to do like the puff ink yeah i mean you know like four washes in pikachu is cracked down the middle that smile is like a jagger joker thing that's going to the cheeks but what about the t-shirt with like the sleepy pikachu on top of the levi's logo that one's pretty okay yeah it is where oh yeah that was kind of cute here's the thing the fact the the fact that they're showing a small version of it and i don't see it on their adult models makes me think it's a kids version because the only other model that seems to have it is a a very thin woman wearing it as a crop top and i am none of those things yeah [Music] i do love me some levi's and i really hate the light blue they did for those pikachu jeans uh the beanie is probably the best item the beanie is the best item yeah light blue jeans are kind of out yeah i mean they're really really like a look that you got to be ready to commit to i have a pair of light blue 501s but that's my like when i'm feeling like a soccer mom that's what goes on it doesn't even state in this article if this is raw denim or what do you think it's actually the advice you think is not doing no raw denim um but yeah not not off do you think not every day that they are going to use raw denim and paint that green garden scene on it i i can take you down some dark alleys of the world of raw depth no yeah no thank you um the secret though is uh raw denim will always be a dark indigo it wouldn't be light blue like that because how are you going to get sick fades on something that's already faded that's already faded i'm sure there's some white blue like egyptian cotton or something that some company is peddling i mean i live in the world of raw denim i haven't seen it yet but hey i've been living in the world of raw denim for 10 years you did it wrong you you two need to start your raw denim podcast and get out of this one wouldn't be surprised if there was already like 17 of them see this is the thing though and this is like the eternal mystery of the universe that if steve and i did do a raw denim podcast that would be like the core inability to see eye to eye that would keep the podcast going is that steve always wants everything to be like in really good condition like like always like well taken care of you know it doesn't ever want anything to go the concept of raw denim is that you just wear it and get it beaten up and that the fades and the cracks and everything like that so it gets discolored over time to show like your person and it's like these two things don't go together raw denim a lot of work there are a surprising amount of denim podcasts yeah if there's a subreddit too there's a dedicated like you know how you have like dedicated tech websites there are dedicated raw denim websites this is almost as bad as my kicks going down the rabbit hole of bike accessories on kickstarter i am now i am now deep in denimhunters.com category denim and boots podcast archives from denim hunters this dude looks exactly like you'd think he would yeah don't get into raw denim i don't plan on it here's the thing if if you are intrigued by the world of raw denim talk to me first learn about the many mistakes that i made as i started down this path and i will help you select the single perfect pair of raw denim jeans to suit your individual needs and i will take a 10 percent commission thank you [Laughter] all right well let's take a break when we come back we have a couple more news articles some cram some top decks some police arresting people some crane yeah clickbait my cram adventures not been great so we will be right back why is there naughty pokemon snap 2 [Music] why is there naughty pokemon snap i pre-ordered it right now right now [Music] it would be cool we are back off pokemon.com top deck academy debuts on youtube and twitch with tips on pokemon tcg deck building they have tips on where i can find some cards to buy so i can build a deck they say there's nothing like putting together your own pokemon tcg deck facing off against an opponent and emerging victorious but that first step can be a little challenging the new top deck academy series is here to show you how to build your own deck as well as give you tips and strategies for the battle ahead this debut episode breaks down the essential elements to building a deck from choosing the right pokemon building a search engine and prepare and how to prepare for your opponent follow along as experts ellis longhurst builds a sample deck from scratch and provides tips on how to make your own deck to succeed you can also read the transcript here to revisit certain key points and a closer look at cards mentioned in this episode a new episode will come out every week and you can watch the entire series here on youtube and twitch and then if you don't want to watch the youtube video there is a a whole article on how to do it so just a quick request for clarification did you say building a search engine am i getting a google or a bing out of this that is what it said yes i don't think that's what they meant ah you you know you need a search mechanic in your deck to find your cards oh but not a google or a bing probably not and ask jeeves maybe let me just make sure i read that right yeah no it says building a search engine yeah i don't understand what that me i mean i've been staring at it since you said it's an engine for searching out cards that you need yeah like did denney or professors research quick ball pokemon communication stabilize like we used to have in the old days are they talking about a search engine that allows you to search through your deck probably deck or discard yeah i see curious of how long this series is going to go comments seem good on the youtube video actually well they probably edit their comments yeah there's only one episode i'd say max 10 min 6. 10 seems right 10 feels right i don't know because for their podcast they only did like five yeah but podcast is hard podcasting is very hard it's the hardest job ever i have to get a blood transfusion after every time i record one of these by the time this uh podcast goes up there should still be some time left because this event was a little different than past events but there was a promoted raid weekend in sword and shield for cramerant to celebrate the movie that came out in japan over a month ago and has no announcement in any other country but from february 3rd from 4 pm pst to february 8th to 4 pm pst you participate in max pokemon sword and shield max raid battles to earn prizes i made a helpful graphic over the weekend for this kramer ant and a bunch of other pokemon will be appearing and you can earn incredible gifts i don't necessarily agree with the the term incredible gifts participate in as many cramer ant raids as possible the number of kramer ant that the trainers defeat around the world within a time frame will determine awesome prizes for everyone again awesome prizes there's a big asterisk there if trainers collectively defeat kramer at more than 500 000 times players will receive one flame orb one toxic orb and one light bulb are they bringing this whole thing back again of we got to get everybody to do the same thing yeah yeah didn't learn their lesson so i yeah i guess like people got the game for christmas maybe they're missing out on flame or toxic or light bulb i suppose well i i certainly know people are cramming it up oh people are cramming if traders defeat kramer at more than 1 million times players will receive one golden bottle cap three bottle caps and three pearl strings all the prizes will be delivered to mystery gift items so if i have four people on my team does that count as four cremerant defeats or one crammer and defeat i don't know these are the critical questions told anybody there they did tweet that like as of friday night there was 530 000 cramer ants defeated or something like that this is the second time they've done this because the first time they did this with was with zara aura 50 as a 15 hour ago play pokemon said together we have defeated hundred and seventy oh thousand one hundred and two wins as of two five so we have to get to a million so seems doable right yeah oh yeah because it's the it's it's now saturday and sunday that people got that was the zero aura thing too when saturday and sunday came those numbers skyrocketed so unlike the other like greed and clefable whale mer event wailord events this started on wednesday night not a thursday night and instead of ending on sunday night it's ending on monday night so they added an extra day two days two days two days which i feel like feels better yes because it's so good i feel like it should always end sometime on a monday yeah i agree because some people might not be able to play games until sunday night and these events were ending sunday afternoon right i feel like a monday morning cut off when they have to go to school is a good idea uh no monday evening is good because if what if i got like grounded for the weekend because let's say i i don't know threw a rock through a window or something you ripped your rod william did you throw a rock through that window for ripping your raw denim and yes i did throw a rock through a window when i was like four years old uh but then it gives you all day monday after you get your switch back to actually do a couple crammer at raids and from what i've seen most people can get like two in a day two shiny ones in a day i've got none in a day yeah i've played two full days i've only gotten two maybe you guys just know the wrong people i mean that's valid it's because you're you guys are goody two shoes and you don't throw rocks through windows so that's why you're just not blessed with the creme or shiny crammer at luck true i can't even say words anymore i what who's who's picking these rewards who who at game freak or the pokemon company was like yes do you know what will get people to come back to this game do you know what will finally get people off their seats turn on the game excited a flame orb a toxic orbital light ball what kind of rewards are these i mean those are very popular uh competitive pokemon items if you're in a competitive pokemon you didn't wait a year and a half into this game cycle to finally pick up the game and try it a year and a half ago i was 12 and i wasn't allowed to go on the internet according to sbj now i'm 13. i can go on the internet and do online competition type things also at one point in time like i would be like yeah golden bottle cap rocks three bottle caps that's that's those are good rewards but the digging duo people give you bottle caps like bottled water they're just here here you go we have so many of them i think the event is fine these events are fun to do a bunch of raids with people turn on the game once a once a month if you've stepped away to try to find a shiny but these rewards are really lackluster the problem the problem is is you are the pokemon equivalent of bougie where you're like i've got like six flame orbs and eighteen light balls and oh my i've got so many bugs i had lights before it was cool us regular pokemon players who don't play pokemon every night of the week we we don't have your fabulous riches my friend and i will take whatever flame or light ball whatever i can get okay your artisanal bottle caps let me bring up regular old bottle caps from our coca-cola bottles i know he's he's got like the his is like that he's like that weird kraft jones soda special edition cranberry and turkey yeah and i'm rc cola heck yeah let me bring up this situation a year ago they they did bulbasaur charmander and squirtle raids for very easy raids and they were those a single squirtle were was dropping toxic orbs and if you just kept doing squirtles you'd be loaded on toxic orbs so now you're saying a year later we as a community have to defeat a half a million crimes for just one measly toxic and flame orb look a year ago i hadn't gotten sword and shield for christmas yet yeah a year ago we had a huge supply of toxic orbs the supply has dwindled because we gave them out like candy oh i see so now we have a lot less toxic orbs in storage so we can't just be handing them out like candy yeah we got to replenish the supply yeah this this is okay so this is still like an ongoing problem with this company though it's like the sun and moon and ultra sun and moon thing where they're like we need you to hatch one million eggs trainers for like one measly single bottle cap for the reward like they want us to come together and do these things but the but the but the rewards are so mediocre and then who is sitting on the other end there there's like probably like two japanese dudes one named bob one named joe and bob is like we need the rewards to be better and joe was like no these are rewards are good enough and then when when we fail these events like we did well we we're not going to fail this kramer on but when we failed all these events in ultrasound ultramoon do you think they just the one looks at each other and says like i told you so the other guy goes i don't know i thought one single uh lepeberry was good enough like this isn't this it's not no you're you're so completely wrong what what the problem is is they're stuck it's it's rocking a hard place they they can't give out no reward because then everybody's gonna complain well why are they having us do this event if there's no rewards for it i can't be bothered but shiny crammer rant that's a crummy pokemon anyways they can't give out a fantastic reward because that would be game breaking no so they're like let's let me look back in this this rummage box we have of like 2019's fabulous pokemon okay yeah we got a couple of the light balls and toxic yeah we'll just throw them in cool it's not like they have a warehouse full of toxic worms and they're like don't understand how technology works yes there's a limited supply of these digital items this this would be my one million reward and i i think it's it it's just taking what they did and made it better it should be three golden bottle caps 10 regular bottle caps and like 10 pearl strings that feels substantial now you're thinking in a competitive sense i can get through only three pokemon max ivs that's not a lot especially when the format's changing every three months and you're you're you're changing your team that's that's giving an option to uh max iv three of your pokemon 10 regular bottle caps will let you max out two more of your pokemon you need six pokemon on a team and ten pearl strings gives you at least some chance of purchasing vitamins if you wanted to purchase vitamins to not do the old way three purl strings is is like nothing you could just remember what a purl string is the purse string is just like it's like purl into it's like pearl big pearl and then purl string um i think a pearl is like 1200 and a big pearl is like 2 000 and a pull string is like 3 500 or something like that i'm probably slightly off on those numbers somebody in their car is raging that i didn't know the cost of pearl string off the top of my head but but i know for sure if you ran the champions cup which takes less than five like less than five or six minutes because you only have to defeat three trainers whatever like alistair bead and leon that's more money than three pearl strings i have no answers for you send your complaints to complaints at pokemon.com there's so many items in pokemon that are easy to get but also easy to like get rid of like yeah you can give me 10 nuggets and i can cash those in and spend them instantly on like 25 vitamins and now it's gone but that is right you're not getting 10 nuggets on the dollar menu no you're not that's still helpful so pearl string is 10 000. yeah so that's that's thirty thousand dollars when you defeat one trainer in a champions cup battle you walk away with twenty two thousand so by doing champions cup with like amulet coin you walk away with like seventy five thousand because it's like 22 22 and then the last one is usually like 32 i think i just think that the rewards should be better it's a problem i can't solve for you well here's the thing you need to write to my uncle in nintendo and state your case simple yeah be the change you want to see in the world steve or don't sit here behind your microphone pretending that you're going to do something be the change i would literally want this event to fail just to show games almost at gamestop just to go show game freak wow that these rewards are very mediocre and not great it's not going to happen because people like you pumped up kramer ant as some sort of fantastic pokemon to be chased and now everybody's like i got to get the crammer ant we're going to run out of cramer ants that's what's going to happen yeah i mean people are doing the cramer ants probably because they want the shiny cramer not necessarily because they're like so desperate for one golden bottle cap you know what was the real reward bottle cap friendships that we made along the way police arrest sword and shield hacker for selling shiny pokemon he made over he made over ten thousand dollars selling pokemon saved files this is off polygon.com oh this is insane japanese authorities have arrested a 23 year old man who is charged with hacking and selling save data for pokemon sword and shield according to a report from a japanese newspaper shimbun via serebii police say the man earned about ten thousand ten thousand nine hundred dollars from altering and selling copies of sword and shield the man reportedly sold a hacked sabble last april and received four thousand four hundred yen around forty one dollars for it the suspect admitted to the charges pokemon company crackdown on pokemon hackers in january the company put out a illegal modified data on notice that was in pokemon home the company the pokemon company said it would penalize cheating players by limiting features like access to home pokemon hackers have been testing the limits of what they could get away with for years a company banned a wave of cheaters in pokemon sun and moon online services back in 2017 there are no current details on what the fine or additional punishes will be but under japan but under japan's unfair competition protection law the editing and distribution of save data is illegal okay so she she's linking that uh players were banned from the global link illegal um so yeah yeah okay this is a different ban we're thinking of two different bands um there were a bunch of people who downloaded sun and moon early from a rom website i think it was like a mexican website uh or maybe it was australian oh australia how could you those people got their ds's bricked which means they could still play their ds but they couldn't go online with any game uh for downloading sun and moon early and they again they didn't download it early sorry they installed a rom dump on their ds to play it early the i don't know too much about japan's unfair competition protection law i do know that to modify your save data is technically illegal i also know that modifying hardware became illegal in japan uh which there were there was a japanese company called the katsu kitty and what they would do is they would take places they would take like playstation vitas where they would take nintendo 3dss and they were even doing that with the nintendo switch and they would modify the hardware to put a video out on on that hardware that's why a lot of streamers are able to capture like their 3ds um i was gonna say that's why you see some streamers capture from their playstation vita but literally no one is doing that because there was no good games in the playstation vita would you don't you start you only say that to aggravate me i love my vita still in boston isn't it yes so when that law passed uh katsu kitty just closed up shop that day and stopped making 3ds capture cards i'm sure they were making plenty of money from making buying a 3ds opening it up modifying it and then selling it for 200 more but i i i guess the the more interesting part of the story is like how how did he get caught well i mean did somebody report him inside sting but you know there was a stakeout online this is going to be will and i's new youtube series uh pokemon cops where we uh stake out known hacking dens waiting to see the transfer go through and then we'll but we capture all sorts of pokemon criminals it's not just people who you know hack pokemon and try to sell them on who is buying digital pokemon online oh just get on discord i'm sure sigh we will capture other pokemon criminals like the person who is buying 11 boxes of champions at target when they're only supposed to buy 10. i mean the the gist here is like the pokemon company wasn't really involved here it was it was just japanese police i i just i still it what hurts my mind is number one that there is a human being out there that said i'm going to make fake pokemon and sell them and ten thousand dollars worth of people out in the world said i'm going to buy this digital pokemon that if i gave it three minutes worth of thought i would realize is fake it's so weird cause like we i have this conversation all the time on like twitch where like somebody will come in probably like younger and they'll be like why why are you shiny hunting why don't you just go to like folks lab or pk hex a shiny and you'll be done in like five minutes which is like true like they're not wrong for being like you know you could just pk hex a shiny and you're like right like i could i could go to ebay and i could probably find sword and shield all shiny pokemon plus 999 master balls for like 60 bucks on ebay i'm sure that exists because it existed for sun and moon and existed for ultra sun and moon and you're right for like a pretty low cost i could just buy the entire thing but and but people do buy those that's why they're being sold because somebody is buying that kind of stuff i don't know who those people are but in my in my brain the the same people buying the same people buying uh complete ultrasound ultramoon every single shiny 99 master balls are probably the same people who are like buying used bowling trophies off ebay and then like putting them on like their fireplace so when their friends come over because people do exist i know so if their friends come over they could be like look at all these bowling trophies i won and you could be like i've never seen you bowl will and it's like well you know i'm retired i won so many matches i i can't pop my can't possibly bowl anymore like and then at the very core of that thought process of like if you're buying all shinies all master balls or if you're buying a bowling trophy or if you're buying like a what other weird things that people are buying like you're probably just a bad person i can't think of any in any situation where you're like i need to buy a first place winning bowling trophy to display it somewhere in my house why are you doing that because when your friends come over and they go like wow will i didn't know you you won a bowling tournament in 1984 and be like yeah i did so at that point if you're saying yeah i did you're lying to your friends uh or you're gonna be like no i actually didn't i bought it on ebay uh you know isn't it funny it's on my fireplace and you're like no it's not funny it sounds like a waste of money why'd you just go bowl bowling is like six dollars what i think it's a little more expensive than six dollars when you have like the nachos and the yeah all that other shoes i do the shoe rental oh you bring your own shoes your own ball do you own a pair of bowling shoes well let me buy the bowling trophy first and it's not like just going to the bowling alley somebody from outback is going to walk forward and say you know what random person who's never been here before you bald so well today we're giving you a trophy oh i know you gotta join the league you have to join the league you have to deal with league people you have to be in the league and deal with all of the high-stakes drama that happens in bowling leagues i mean you're putting your life on the line when you enter a bowling league because they are dead lee buy the trophy and save your save a life buy a trophy that's my new model of dollars r us and bowling trophies dollars dollars are honest by the dollar bowling trophies i don't it's it's like the same with like fortnite or apex or something of the people who installed the like auto aim things so they can win matches i just doesn't why are you playing competitive game if you can it's like 90 of call of duty players right yeah i don't understand that if that's where this country has gotten to it's time we need to get a new country yeah i don't think it's just the united states installing cheat engines [Applause] [Laughter] we forgot this bit of news at the when we're talking about the tcg stuff uh by the way uh by the way chris sent in this and the pokemon journeys news kevin sent in the pokemon fan arrested from our site community uh but this is general mills cereal boxes to include pokemon 25th anniversary booster packs as well [Music] real close to general mills we can hang out at their warehouse yeah i'm heading over to some dumpsters go to their offices and be like yo someone has shared images online of the general mills promo pack being being distributed to general mill cereal boxes these three card packs feature galler pokemon these promos were previously released and five of them will get hollow treatment these hollow cards were previously cosmo hollows uh promos that they've done in the past according to a facebook group called pokemon tcg one where these images were pulled from the packs were released on february 27 the packs will be released on february 27 2021 we cannot confirm the date ourselves the set is also the set also got revealed and we've seen specific cards we'll get hollow treatment the pikachu promo has the 25th anniversary stamp logo there we don't know if um any other specific cards will are rarer than other cards in the pack uh the pokemon company mentioned two days ago they would work with other known brands including general mills the sad thing is all the count chocula fans out there are not going to be able to find a single box of count dracula for like the next six months yep i'm assuming out of all these cards none of the matter except the pikachu what do you mean none of them matter well the pikachu is gonna have the like logo on it oh sorry we know the ones that are at least hollow gasiflor pikachu morpiko ponyta hattena and wulu will be hollow but we don't know if they will have the logo like the pikachu will the 25 logo can i just go to general mills and buy the packs or that's what we're gonna do yeah they're out there and uh like by maple grove out there yeah and when they're over in golden valley uh maple grove golden valley is pretty much the same place i mean yes one's just older and less pretentious i don't want to buy cereal at least with mcdonald's i can eat cereal no i don't i have most cereal like rips up your mouth what oh gracious me i bet that will like captain cereal what captain crunch is the one cereal that does rip up your mouth yes peanut butter crunch is my favorite cereal i'm only allowed to eat it on my birthday because i will eat six boxes in succession but every other cereal in the world is very gentle and kind you cannot tell me that you have had honey nut cheerios and come away with your mouth bleeding i don't i don't i don't cheerio i'm just i'm talking to steve i haven't had honey nut cheerios in like a decade lucky charms are not doing anything to your mouth because everything in that product melts into the milk pretty much are you saying lucky charms is general mills yes tricks is general males kicks is general mills oh i don't know if they're gonna put it is somebody gonna put are they gonna put pax and fiber one get your raisin nut bread with pokemon cards in it how much is a box of cereal like four bucks 350 probably depends on the size here are my top contenders for pokemon cards all of the lucky charms will have it in it cocoa puffs will have it in it reese puffs will have it in it and cookie crisps and tricks those are the ones i'm predicting ooh i like tricks though i'd eat tricks for some pokemon cards yeah greg tricks are for kids i'm a child at heart [Laughter] i think gosh i can't buy boxes yes you can no i think i would just rather like i think it says save my headache i would just go to tcgplayer wait for the pikachu to be posted there order it even though it might be like 10 or 15 i there's no way i could possibly eat 15 worth of cereal so who's buying the bowling trophy now steve exactly i was just thinking the same thing the bowling trophy now i'm not buying a fake pikachu card i'm buying the real pikachu card i'm just saving the world you didn't even eat the cereal you've got to eat that count chocula you went to it you went to small business i would get it but unfortunately it's not spooky season so good coco puffs is the same product spooky season is when boo berry and frankenberry come back out count chocula's year round i don't think not in milwaukee it's a rare gem out here are you counting chocolate kellogg's this is hush [Laughter] all cereals are general mills i mean no count dracula is general mills i could have sworn it kellogg's turned their back on the tasty children's cereal world you can't trust the next podcast winner that's the next cereal right there man we should talk about cereal in the 70s that was a wild time that was a that they were sitting there with a bowl of cookie crisp put whole milk on it and then actually put two teaspoons of sugar on top of your cookie crisp because it it was not sweet enough it was not we were craving and strawberry cow which would turn your milk into strawberry milk yeah too bad they found that that was radioactive it gave me cancer i didn't that's how you're going to finance your children's college education yeah now's the time to sell just get rid of all these pokemon cards true wait wait a year then rebuy them back at a cheaper price all right greg question of the week i can't wait to hear you ask ask the question of the week this is from andrew according to lieutenant serge his pokemon saved him during a war which pokemon would you have which pokemon would you have at your side in a pokemon world war scenario i mean as much as i want to say my precious flower that is for peace times i am picking the bolt hund as proven by the crown tundra will chase anybody down no fear by my side i'm the new lieutenant search it's very interesting it really defines your perspective on how you react to your surroundings your environment much in the same way as the uh like if you could have be either have the ability to turn invisible or fly which would you choose and it's like people who turn invisible are creepy because they want to like sneak around and listen to other folks conversations while people who fly are like very brave because they're going to be there's no way to hide that everybody's going to see you fly and greg it's like you're you're a violent warmonger you want to engage in the violence my choice would be an abra because you know what i'm going to teleport out of any dangerous situation the minute the little twitch on somebody's eyelid wiggles i'm out goodbye oh see i was thinking more of like a defensive pokemon like a gallerian surfetch or like a obstagoon well because you want to engage in the violence no i want to protect your back on violence i'm peaceful it's a world war generally those are extreme situations and sitting by the side and doing nothing is allowing fascism to thrive so you're not sitting by the side doing nothing i am i'm out i'm out go on i find me in machu picchu all right switzerland i'm doing the hard work i'm making the world a better place me and bolton really violence begets violence my friend i didn't start the fire it was burdened before i got there i'm i'm going sir fetch then i got the shield to protect me yeah he has a lance it'll be like monster hunter oh man don't get my monster hunter blood boiling i am so ready all right will pokemon of the week all right last week's pokemon of the week had like 30 useless clues and then one clue that you actually needed to actually solve the puzzle of who was the pokemon of the week but it was basically like think of all of the gen 7 pokemon mythical pokemon of which there were technically five although technically three of them really kind of like are just kind of jammed in there but four of the five their names start with the letter m and one of them does not and the pokemon of the week was the one that doesn't start with the letter m it's chat it's never chat except for one time it does not start with the letter m also not a mythical it's zara aura zara aura the electric kitty cat tony the tiger looking thing that was one of the clues buddy uh one of my favorite monsters to hunt in monster hunter is also an electric kitty cat they never made it into shuffle so um and everybody's seen the shiny because you got one for free didn't meet meet the cut i don't think i picked up a shiny aurora at any point did it oh that's like there's something about pokemon home that i find repulsive and it's a year and it's still bad i just but you remember even when it came out it was like oh i gotta install this i gotta use it i just like i don't know what it is i just i don't want a pokemon home i don't know what it is either it's like when i'm scrolling through pokemon home for scrolling and pokemon go pokemon go like looking at your pokemon and scrolling through just feels like a better experience well i don't even i i always i actually have just now realized i didn't even install pokemon home on my new phone when i got my new phone i still have it on my old phone but i don't have it on my new phone because i just i'm so repulsed by it is there are there any trivias about no zero aura it was a really bad movie that upset most people yeah i mentioned that i wasn't even in the movie for like more than like five minutes and ash was such a jerk to it too oh god i hate that baby sarah's the only electric type mythical pokemon there you go i mean pure electric right or oh mythical never mind yes yes in the isle of armor dlc in order to attain a chinese aurora a dynamaxx zero aura would be required for one million players making it the only mythical that could be encountered in max raid battles interesting and pokemon kind of a stretch for a trivia but sure okay hold on i don't know if this is a typo on bubblepedia in pokemon the movie colon the power of us colon zeraora's story i don't sarah is described being born in an explosion called by a lightning bolt striking the mouth of an un erupting volcano i mean that happens a lot oh i see pokemon the movie colon the power of us colon zera aura's story is a tie-in manga adapt uh adaptation ah yes oh i was thinking of going to the source today too i wonder if they have it there oh i doubt it is the source still open greg please tell me the source is still open okay they got a lot of mangas they do but i don't i don't know that they have a huge amount i've never really seen a huge amount of pokemon manga there but i granted i haven't i've seen i haven't looked at very long mangas there are you ready for this week's pokemon of the week born ready fair warning again that was the last that was last week tomorrow sunday february 7th 2021 is a very special day for brent's husband because of the spotlight on a particular pokemon if you consider the first three pokemon types we encounter in most games there is only one pokemon without requiring a hidden ability or being related to a camel that is the exact opposite of this pokemon you may need to consult with an oracle to find the answer look i made it so short nobody can have lost track of the path of that particular clue right there all right well we will be back next week whoa this is the first podcast in a long time we didn't do any pogo news weird i mean i guess they announced everything for february and then we called it a day yeah and the real february events tomorrow so yep yeah rosalia but after this goes up and then i'm sure we'll have plenty of stuff to talk about for you know i do want to mention one thing i do get this a lot during twitch chat i do want to clarify this so the the shiny mew thing and the uh the kanto event uh i do want to clarify this so uh some people are worried that they're gonna spend twelve dollars and not get the mew or some people don't know if they'll have time to do it uh there are two different events and this is what you need to like the kanto event from nine to nine on saturday is not the mew event there there are two different events think of it like pokemon go fest where saturday had the shadow mewtwo event and sunday had the victini event there will probably be overlap in the two different events like for example you might have to catch you know 50 unique pokemon to go to the mew quest line but you need 150 to finish the kanto event quest line that being said as long as you pick up the mew quest you will be guaranteed your mew the problem why will never got victini is because we'll never open the app on sunday as a ticket holder to accept the victini quest but if will was my bad son for that if will was to accept the victini quest even after the sunday is over he would he would have still been able to do the victini quest but he never accepted it so yes it is possible i suppose you could spend 12.99 and then never log in at all between saturday and then never get the quest but as long as you spell spend the 12.99 and accept the mew quest you will eventually be guaranteed a shiny mew even if you don't get it that saturday and based on what niantic has said the mew quest is extremely long and tedious i'm sure of hardcore players will finish it the day of i mean there are already people at level 50 in pokemon go uh but just so you know if you spend the 11.99 and you cannot play all day on saturday it's okay you'll still be able to get your mew you just have to log in but that being said i'm sure niantic will clear that up as we get closer to that event of exactly what is needed to accomplish that but i just wanted to clear that up for people who were on the fence about spending 12 okay with that being said if you want to follow us on twitter will is that watching the sink i'm at dragging a lake uh greg's at white wing you can follow us on tick tock instagram youtube and twitter at
