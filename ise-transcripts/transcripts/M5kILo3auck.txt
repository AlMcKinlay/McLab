[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 400 and 10th episode of the Pokemon podcast it's super effective I'm your host s BJ will here with me will Anderson owner of unpopular opinions including I don't really care for the ariana grande Lady Gaga song that came out and I can't tell the difference between Carly Rae Jepsen and Miley Cyrus that's me don't get me started on that song we're gonna have to have our own podcast to talk about the disappointments greg here i am here i have i've i've done my gay duty i listened to the pop song that was released that has everybody happy that's what I'm saying that's the ariana grande Lady Gaga I got ya 2010 Basement Jaxx called they want their songs yeah so I listened to that and then I was like okay back here a lot of Pokemon news this week specifically regarding sword and shield DLC is there an angel Pokemon angel a tangent about Angela - the Angela's that the Angela's scream from above light beams down on Pokemon home it finally got another update what do they even fix I will get to that yeah so let's jump into some news of course all the sword and shield news let's start with some Pokemon masters little disclosure I am partnered with DNA will and Greg are not very simple master news here either either like or you don't jasmine and steelix added to the game the johto a region gym leader jasmine and her iconic partner steelix are coming to masters well this was published May 21st I believe steeped adjustments in the game now yeah she made her debut in pokemon gold and pokemon silver jasmine was the first gym leader to specialize with steel type Pokemon that many trainers have ever encountered since she's learned some new tricks are sure to come in handy and possio using jasmine and steelix in battles start off by using her ex defense to sharply increase your whole team's defense then unleash sync move steel clad iron tail not only will the sync move mega evolve steelix into mega steelix for the rest of the battle but it will also become more powerful based on how high Jasmine's and steel axes defenses have been raised there's also a flying-type event going on in the game right now pretty short and simple I don't know if Greg you have pulled jasmine probably not because I think you've been pulling for Wally I poke poultra wall-e still have not had wall-e and now I'm like I don't have a lot of gems cuz some of us you know get the old gem filled fashion way we earned them instead of you know signing our soul away to get gems I don't know what you mean Steven how many gems have I have six hundred and twenty so I I've started to pull once on Jasmine and once on wall-e to maximize my dissatisfaction both will be bad it's like shiny hunting you're just yeah consistently disappointed until you finally get it oh I still don't have that to Piper oh look it's Bruno let's see if they get Wally guarantee you I won't how sad would you be if I tried to pull for Wally and I actually got him oh look it's tape but did you get Liza I have I've had the twins for years are you kidding me I have the twins I have the Bryson's I have the Bugsy's I would be happy for you will if you pulled any of these top tier Pokemon master sync pairs could I trade it to you know is there any gotcha game that has trading I don't think so otherwise that I'm like no I feel like there is something that does this is off Pokemon calm this is the big news which I don't know events in date format people wind that up to pointing at specific times of like oh the Pokemon community loves to loves their dates and loves their forecasting right and they have never been wrong Yeah right we got home on the seventh and yeah that's beyond Umbreon and Jen too and then they gave us two more V's in Gen 4 and then they gave us two more and they gave us another even Gen 6 so obviously more V's and gen8 the pattern guys oh wait but anything's gonna happen in the aisle armor new EB form got it because of the fighting Jojo funds we get a fighting well I mean that's why we've had gigantic maxi V all this is to prepare us prepare us for slappy on the slapping Pokemon get gallery' and mr. mime ponies of course we'll add Meowth with hidden abilities for cool Pokemon these are Pokemon comms words not mine for cool Pokemon and bonus items via mystery gift in sword and shield with the release of the aisle of armor the first part of the sword and shield expansion past drawing near so it doesn't look like we're getting a delay on this which I don't necessarily think we would have since Game Freak did technically put out a press release in Japanese a couple of months ago saying that they were working at home and they personally you know didn't think there was gonna be any delays they just you can cut and paste at home I've done it for my job month and a half now it's true yeah I would they're cutting there they're pros they got the Excel spreadsheets open yep players of sword and shield will be able to receive for special glaring pokemon via mystery gift starting May 22nd there will be a new mystery gift every week containing a Pokemon gallery' and mr. mime ghoul Aaron Pony tugged glaring corsola and glaring Meowth along with a variety of items all of these Pokemon will have hidden abilities making them valuable additions to your teams and the mr. mime was in a cherish ball so I think probably safe - safe to gamble maybe the next three will be in cherish ball if you care about the poke ball it's in just just so you know cherish ball does not break down the cherish ball in the master ball are the two that do not breed downward so this is okay this is another kind of silly thing that the English Pokemon website does didn't put like end dates on which is like kind of weird yeah but there are end dates so they they just say like May 22nd glaring mr. mime May 29th Hilarion Ponyta so it doesn't specifically say Glary and mr. mime ends but they do so when I went to the Japanese website they do have actual end dates there it is that when they go mr. mime when a glaring Ponyta starts glaring mr. mime does and it'll keep that in mind I made a handy graphic it's on Twitter and Instagram it'll be in the show notes below if you just want something to refer to and I try to make graphics for news so they're easy to follow they're shareable and I think they've been received well people say they like them so May 22nd glarry and mr. mime hidden ability ice body plus you'll get a lower ball a moon ball a heavy ball in a dream ball so even if you don't want the mr. mime you get some a procore and pokeballs here I never used those I'm feeling in such a big decision upon which one to use or if they ever make I never make that decision and I do everything in luxury balls they have said in the trailer a couple months ago they said that there will be a new they said like I can't remember the exact word that said something of the sort of more APRA corn balls or whatever I don't know people got all up in arms and I'm like oh we're gonna it's we're gonna have apricot trees it's gonna be really easy to do it Kurt will be back I don't know if you guys remember Curtis member Kerr jump to these conclusions right away and maybe that's true maybe maybe like maybe old man Kurt shows up they showed slow poke in the trailer we all know Kurt loves slowpoke maybe he's gonna slam a hammer May Capricorn balls left and right pump a mouth then you don't have to worry about you know these hard decisions of I only have to dream balls do I want to waste this in a dream ball I broke out I just wasted a dream ball God turn off my game I mean 200 IQ is you bring the ampere you ball fetch it back you know no big deal well you're only a needs dream boundary P do know that's baseball no beach ball is for gallery and meow but because he's a beast these events make it seem like they still want these balls to be rare yes and these events and you don't trickling balls out like this there was a weird sentence when you when you trickle poke a balls in in a dlc sort away or in downloadable content sort of way it does it is a way to encourage training which i think they've kind of figured that out of like oh you know I'll use my dream ball on lit wick and now I can give people lit wicks and then they can then they don't have to waste their dream ball I don't look right it's a really good way of encouraging trading but going back of like there probably will be a way to get these APRA corn balls in the island of armor isle of armor maybe you know maybe you have to like you know get to the end of the tower or something but there is a way to do it in sort and shield through the champion cup you can get more of these pokeballs they're extremely extremely rare so I just I get people love these pokeballs and I saw so many people get excited being like oh my gosh we finally have a way to get more of these there was always a way to get more going through the champion Cup was the way so just incredibly unpleasant and what he wants to do it that way so I just you know maybe reassessing about expectations of I who's to say that in the olive armor there's not some other tedious way to get it you have battle points that you have to do I kind of like the rareness of of these pokeballs because I think it does encourage the trading and it makes them feel a little bit special I only use one type of pokeball like for my entire almost my entire glare and pokedex I use one type of pokeball dusk ball you know what I'm only going through these horrible raids to catch pokemon that I need for utility and Dusk's ball's gonna get the job done for me although I did lose an Eevee to a dusk ball this morning mom May 29th once the mr. Byam ends that'll be glaring Ponyta with hidden ability anticipation it's coming with a Louisville ball fastball love ball friend ball beast ball so five pokeballs that time and then June 5th gallery' and corsola with the hidden ability and cursed a body plus you'll be able to get a sweet Apple a tart apple a chipped pot a cracked pot a sachet sachet am I saying that right sach that's good enough Ashley sure and whipped dream I could be happy for that Apple because that's one of the few things holding me back and completed my pokédex don't have no Appleton yet and then finally June 12th go area mouth Meowth with its hidden ability uh net nerve plus a hundred XP candies the large size and fifty nuggets is this what I want you know no this is glaring me out super me a gigantic max mouth next week I'm sick of all these Charizard haters Charizard did everything Leon has a charger let's talk about me out every episode of the anime downloadable meows in June 12th free me out when you buy the game where is the Meowth hate Charizard is getting too much hate it's actually Meowth Meowth has a Nolan form a gallery' inform look at all this me off what why knows I don't I don't really care I like now yeah I'll get a lot of destiny I mean you're a cat person you're a cat person so you your your whole rant came off as false because you have three Milwaukee and meows thank you very much in your own home at two welcome Archer is a monster actually there's a big one big biggie those of us who have dogs where's the ampere love where's the Bolton's love where's my downloadable hidden ability Bolton nowhere like it what what I don't think well isn't it just ball fetch does the Emperor oh no yep or doesn't everything mildew yeah sure yeah but that's got like ball fetch is the go-to I'm not I'm not throwing a single APRA corn ball unless you for something I mean rattled is it's hidden yeah yeah yeah right just like now you're just being rude well although I'm okay so competitive for Bolton's hidden ability could be real good mm-hmm I mean you'd have to switch the special attack which both hubs not great at Special Attack bad there is neither involved my shiny hamper to both this Paul fesses up way more versatile than anything both nickname right but give me my competitive Bolton's so that I can lose my one battle with my good dog in the online competition which have already done the gallery' Emmaus Meowth glared mouth guilt glare Ian mouth event starts June 12th which is a Friday on the calendar far in the future which makes people tend to believe that either the island of armour comes the 19th if we're assuming that the Meowth event last owed so the Japanese website doesn't say when the glaring mouth event ends it says when the you know mime event ends when the pony tail starts ponytail ends when the Cursillo starts corsola ends with the Meowth starts but the Japanese and the English website there's no end date for the Meowth could be a week like the first three if it isn't that means that the island of armor since Nintendo has a history of releasing things on Friday I can't remember and there's probably out of you know all the Switch games well out of the all first party Nintendo games I can't remember one not coming out on Friday that would maybe lean to that the DLC either comes out the 19th when the Meowth event technically would end compared to the other ones or because they said by the end of June the other date is the 26 I don't think he's events suddenly solidify that because there's only four Fridays in the month of June so I don't know roll a die it's either the 5th of the 12th the 19th of the 26 so they said by the end of June it could be the fifth it could be the 12th I mean realistically if they're trying to get everything right they haven't set a date yet they probably want to give people a heads up probably won't be the fifth or twelfth because I feel like maybe that's not enough time we'll probably see one more trailer to really sell the game and show a new feature so 19th and 26th seem extremely plausible as dates I agree it's the 19th no contention here I think if they're showing a trailer they probably have to show new gallery' and pokemon and probably new Giganta max pokemon I think that would really solidify people's purchases not only do you want a trailer to give people a reason to spend the $30 whether that's you know a goal Arian Flygon a gigantic flag on a the to ghal Aryan smoking forms alright yeah well I will slow Punk is really popular I like a gal Aryan side duck likes you you pick a pokemon that people love and identify with and you know 84 or they have all the all the the new legendaries and mythical that you get well yeah they do have cup foo and her Shifu but the the Moltres and Zapdos stuff that's not till the second one the second expansion no I meant [Music] galaxy brain rabbit Oh Cal Cal a Rex Cal Eric yeah oh he's not until the second expand to the second one either yeah we're getting we're gaining a Shifu and cup foo this this time around besides Venusaur and Blastoise getting Giganta max forms and the starters getting Giganta max for them there has to be some other pokemon getting checking it to max form to get people excited maybe the Blastoise and the Venus or is enough but not only do you want to show a trailer to get people who already own the game to purchase the $30 do you want to show a trailer that is good enough where somebody who hasn't considered buying sword and shield to then go well I want to get this I'm sure whenever that trailer drops it'll probably be a day I sleep in because like it seems to happen it's like sleeping today oh gosh I just missed the Pokemon news well how do you sleep in on Tuesday and just make it easy on all of us yeah wait what does sleep in mean for you sleep in is like 1:00 p.m. that's pretty decent into the day yeah yeah but I assume they show a trailer in that the trend of the trailer it says a date whether that's June 19 June 26 June 12 whatever hundred experience candies and 50 big nuggets that's a lot of money for that June 12th with the meows so I wonder if clothes are gonna be real real expensive in this expansion yep I have the one outfit I need I don't need any more clothes I need wishing pieces that's it so Pokemon home got updated and we're gonna talk about that in a bit but because Pokemon home got updated that meant that data miners have seen that some new moves have existed in Pokemon home which probably lead to what is possibly coming in Pokemon sword and shield DLC so now this is this is a rumor I think it's slightly interesting there just moves we don't know what the moves do we don't know we don't know who knows the moves we just know the names of the moves there's 21 moves that were pulled from the Pokemon home update here I'm gonna read this off my Nintendo news but this was pulled from sentro Pokemon which is a Spanish Pokemon website that has their the website that they'll pull the assets from Pokemon games so if you've ever watched like a twitch streamer and they have like a little animated Pokemon dancing around that that was probably pulled directly from you know Sun and moons files that animated Pokemon so they pull that stuff they provide those assets ahead and don't know if the Pokemon company knows about them or cares or wants to shut them down but so they have French Italian and Spanish on their website I can't read any of that - end of news apparently did the translation here so these are probably not final names for moves either but we never know so these are some of the moves here expanding force steel roller scale shot meteor beam shell sidearm misty explosion grassy Glide rising voltage see those last three have like a theme to them a terrain plus skitter smack burning jealousy lash out those to sound like dark type moves poltergeist which I guess is not as a move corrosive gas coaching which maybe sounds like a helping hand flip turn triple axel those are two they're adding skateboarding type to the game dual wing beat scorching sands jungle healing which we know is Axl is an ice skating move oh my bad you're yeah Mike flip into an ollie well the first one is called flip turn no jungle healing which we know is a move is a Ruth's signature move wicked blow and surging strikes so those are the 21 moves that seemed to be added to the game or maybe added to the game I can this is that's the none of this is confirmed this is just what people have seen in the update to Pokemon homes database now I'm gonna read them all in Italian see I mean that and they're certain they're just moves they're not yes we're certain their moves yeah there is a there is a move category database in Pokemon home jungle healing we know for sure is a move because they already announced that with Giroud the data miners are believing that both wicked blow and surging strikes are signature moves for her Shifu that sounds right for they're generating poltergeist is prop probably a move for Polti guy that doesn't sound appropriate i corrosive gas sounds like something would be for gallery' and wheezing I know I would think whose rock and roll dude dagnabbit ah that's tricity yeah cuz he's more poisoning I would say rising voltage sounds like a move for toxicity toxicity doesn't fly rising voltage I don't know I feel like that means like increasing the that feels like electric terrain almost but obviously electric terrain is electric train rising voltage misty explosion grassy glide rising voltage terrain plus all seem like but do we think that new like are we making the assumption that new moves are going on existing already in the game Pokemon and not just exclusive for the ones that are being introduced in this expansion so all the ones are being added we'll get these new moves but the ones that already have set move pools are gonna be in touch like what's like making us think that thee that they're gonna start changing if the move sets of ones that are already been in the game to give you a reason to go through the dojo multiple times do you think these are gonna be I bet these are dojo exclusive moves where you have to take your bike you guys through the dojo and learn what the dude is teaching you can move move yeah yeah yeah okay that makes sense because if this whole thing is based around this dojo and if you do the dojo once and you're done people are gonna be like well well that was a waste of $30 but you need to have a reason for somebody to go through the dojo multiple times with different Pokemon and if you're like well you love your toxicity or toxicity is really sweet but now if you take your toxicity through the dojo you walk out with toxicity learning rising voltage that's what I think otherwise I don't I don't know why you would go through the dojo multiple times I mean like what do you even do for the bat like the battle tower why do you go that through that multiple times to get battle to get BP and I appre cornballs no no that's champion cup champion Cup is for a pro cornballs and for wishing pieces and whatever the battle tower is for BP which you can buy ability capsules and stuff it also gives you the ribbon for those who care about that but otherwise this another battling thing and we know there are two towers and we know that depending on what tower you go locks and your cub foo and if they built these two towers or gameplay I can't imagine they want you to go through them once I can't think of a single tower in Pokemon and a Pokemon game where they don't want you to go through multiple times maybe Bellsprout but usually they want you to go through these things you know multiple times yeah I guess you'd like if the if these moves are worth the tutoring venture just a rumor though I mean again these moves were in the database of Pokemon home but we have no clue if they will actually be in a final Pokemon product so I want to stress that it's just a rumor mm-hmm all right from hackers do you trust hackers you trust do you hackers stolen your identity by just believing them speaking of hacking we're gonna hack into a break and then when we come back we'll actually talk about the changes to Pokemon home and then we have a little bit other news and then we'll wrap up the show so we will be right back [Music] [Music] all right let's talk about some Pokemon home it updated to one point one point zero whoo there's your news all right a news item right okay silver none updated on May 22nd UTC thank you for your continued support of Pokemon home this notice is to inform you that your mobile device has been updated to one point one point zero the the update is include the following battle data feature has been implemented people were really excited about that one a bug does that mean you can actually check your battle record and competitions and download rules on to the device Oh a bug where the information for Giganta max elke Remy would not be registered and other issues have been fixed I don't know [Music] additionally to celebrate this update trading Pokemon in-home will be an enhanced for a limited time this is really important people who have people have missed this part but we're gonna talk about that there is a separate notice in the mobile device version of Pokemon home to notify you when the limited period is going to end but this might be news I have the whole thing okay I don't look I'm not game freak ok so you can so they added uh so they you could trade with friends far away you'll be able to friend trade to trade pokémon with friends who are far away great Pokemon with more people around the world using wonder box the time is needed to complete a trade using one or box time has been shortened and then enjoy more casual trades using trade room the number of times you're allowed to join a free group has been increased from three to ten additionally the time periods for a player can join a room to select a pokemon have been shortened which we've complained about that it was a little long yeah real long I said are we gonna test this out live Steve are we gonna trade cuz that makes great audio to answer your one question Greg the the reason why they they don't have this is to prevent people from selling Pokemon I'm waiting I'm waiting for a trade right on Greg oh my word I started it oh hey look I think yeah well I mean I think a lot of people were frustrated because you know if you're missing if you're missing I don't know if you're just missing Zehra aura to complete your pokedex and you have a bunch of friends that have zero aura and you don't live near those friends it can be extremely frustrating why do we have to move zero aura from Pokemon home to sword and shield just to trade get that so I don't know why I mean you could yeah I mean will you make a great point of like to prevent people from selling but the people who are buying and the people are selling are going to those both those communities are gonna exist regardless of huh home existing or not exactly yeah but that doesn't mean I have to make it easier for them but we did it trade complete what you trade I got him erectus I got a I got a Roselia oh that sounds about right for both of you guys yeah if I if I'm in Pokemon home and I trade a shell met for a Kara blast am I getting what I expect on the other end or am I just getting a Sheldon in a Kara blast right now I don't have extras I got here I'll trade with Greg I got I'll do I'll do they have it it's good I got I got all of them you let me know what you need on mr. Pokemon I got all the Pokemon so they did limit this is what I this is what I have so many thoughts about this either way organize them they only allow you to trade ten times a day with friends so if if their goal is to prevent people from just trading all day and filling a pokedex maybe that's why but you can do that in Soren shield right I could sit there and trade you all day we'll until you have a complete pokedex in Soren shield I have one Kara blast so I will trade a new a shell with them alright but they limit it ten times at which you know if I trade this Kara blast of Greg and Greg trades me a shell mitt and then they evolve and then we trade back that's two trades so if I'm trading will zero aura for the decks completion he trades a bit what am I looking for shell met okay since from do you honestly think you have a special from the gala region alright we'll do this one all right it looks kind of like a simplified Pokemon go the interface yeah goodbye shell MIT goodbye Kara blast this is how long the trade is taking I'm not gonna cut this audio to prove that sure and everything I mean it's pretty look will it has to go to NASA and then back that's how trading acts has to go to 18 satellites in the sky take a care of shellman it did not a vow thank you for the science fair we did it so you don't have to so I would assume it would be the same with like Haunter and stuff yeah that's dumb but they did build the poll functionality into the game yeah I got just this lonely little shellman here it's a bashful I wish they would just say why they care about this like they clearly do they clearly launched an app with no trading not because they didn't know how to do it because they purposely didn't want people to trade and then they're added trading and then they said it's temporary and you can trade 10 times a day which i think is fair I think that's fine like hey you want to complete your pokedex and you're gonna rope your friend into trading you 200 Pokemon 10 a day I mean I really think that that's still all around not selling Pokemon because the issue is that you're doing this on mobile so there may be some people that are maintaining their pokedex and mobile and don't have a switch yet and they'd still be interested in buying Pokemon I feel like that's such a very specific and small use case to stop millions of people from trading a huge part of the game well yeah I mean there's nothing and no disagreement I mean there's nothing about limbing in in-home that suddenly stops buying Pokemon and you still have to do friend codes do Japanese people even use eBay I don't know if anybody's told them about me I'll check they it's just I'm frustrated in the communication aspect like what they have a thought process of doing this and they just don't communicate it with us like in sword and shield they locked the starters which you can jump to the conclusion the reason they lock starters is because they didn't want people to turn on and off their game for 40 plus hours or 80 plus hours or 200 put like you're not guaranteed a shiny even if it's one in four thousand I have an answer and so they want people to play the game and shiny hunt later so like logically that makes sense they don't want you to you know get to zekrom in black and white and turn on an offer game over and over because they probably want you to see the end of their video game that they made and then when you done when you're done with that end of the video game then you can do whatever you want I think it's very important or your player base to experience the entire package you made so they don't get halfway through a game and then go well this ruined my fun because I didn't get my shiny or I didn't get this or I didn't get that and now I'm going to go to a different game trading at home I can't think of what the logic is at this point and if it is like something like what we don't want people hacking or we don't want people completing the deck so we're trying to like a even the preventing of mythical x' from GTS that totally makes sense you know they want mythical x' to be these rare or pokemon and you can trade Legendary's you can trade forms you can trade a lola you can trade any Pokemon that isn't mythical through GTS cool even if it's hacked but even if it's act which they haven't figured out how to stop or whatever but like come out and say like the reason we don't want mythical x' to be traded on GTS is because we want them to feel special like just tell us what you want to do what you want us to do with your products like why don't are you limiting ten like give us a reason why or tell us like what your thought processes of this why are you going to remove it in the future we are temporarily giving you the ability to trade with people all over the world we will remove that you will see an update in Pokemon home in the future of one we're removing it but why are you giving it to us now are you taking it away and why are you taking it away like just communicate I don't I don't I don't get it I don't get I don't like normally if a business isn't saying something I can usually figure out the the convoluted reason why a corporation would stop it I cannot begin to fathom on a thing that's about trading when you already have multiple steps when you can literally contact a person who's selling it and throw it up in the GTS and say I'm gonna look for this very specific thing you look for this very specific thing go which I've done when I was getting on my video it was really easy to do that allowing this ease and taking it away doesn't make sense if you don't want the problem whatever bizarre problem you're trying to solve if you don't want that problem figure out your code how you're gonna fix it this is it I can't I can't I can't understand also there's no eBay in Japan yeah I saw that so they clearly don't want us a software set for things Zappos ntozake and aterna tests of a lie sorry type know anything that is given to you by a person in that game you can't software set for slowpoke so they're like we're done we don't want people to suffer set okay sure fine but but they also haven't fixed the the break bend bug where people are just moving their clock forward like four days Oh time travelers are the word like within this is such a small market sample but within twitch the second they launched Eevee Giganta max Eevee which by the time this podcast goes up it would probably be rotated - Meowth but within five minutes of Eevee being live at 7:05 p.m. Central Time I went to twitch which is Pokemon sword and shield directory and I counted over 50 people hosting SHINee Giganta max Eevee on their streams desperate for anyone to watch them and give them their treasure Wow see once again selling stuff like within five minutes then they have this figured out and if they care about softer setting which they seem to care about now which is fine whatever I get it I also I've said this million times in this podcast I think turning on and off a video game is a bad way to consume a video game if they care about that then why have they did that is island of armor going to fix this right down exploit we know that there's going to be more raids they they care about this but they don't care about that and if they do care about that they haven't fixed it but they have fixed like the wonder trade bug which was like malicious that was I guess more malicious than like a raid em exploit and and they're doing more and more events and they seem to care about that kind of stuff and they don't want people to trade in home unless they're standing next to people but then they just allowed people to trade in home over the Internet but they're going to take it away from everyone is there like two people at Game Freak that leads some sort of divisions that like what is like let them have fun and the other was like no we need to ensure the rarity of these creatures it's no it's it's it's not even that it's it's a it's it's probably like what do we say Game Freak has 180 employees or something like that yeah yeah so it's a hundred and seventy nine of them who are like let's just let people have fun and do fun things and we'll be creative and have creative ways to people have fun and then there's the lawyer and the lawyer says well if we do this we assume a liability and we're going to get sued because somebody's out there selling hacked Pokemon and we knew that it was too easy for people to make hacked Pokemon and now they've created a marketplace for these on your mobile device and some parent got mad so now we have a lawsuit and we really didn't need that aggravation there's a difference though of like somebody actually hacking the game and selling master balls on three masses by the way if you're curious what the price of three master balls are it's $10 on eBay so that's a lot not paying ten real dollars for that well it's not polka bucks I don't know if you can duplicate items in-game I don't think so I don't think there's like a duplication exploit like Animal Crossing seems to have every single week where somebody else has figured out a way to like like Bob the table twist the table shake the table and all of a sudden you got two items pop it but there's like I feel like there's a difference of people exploiting an obvious issue which is the right den because they're not using software to do that and then there's a difference of somebody just X but like I've sold eBay get Giganta max shiny square Charizard $5.99 500 sold not legit it all caps legit shiny like that was probably made with pkx and then duplicated a million times then dudes making $5 in Charizard and and there's a market who's buying it and I feel like I'm more mad at the the people buying the Charizard than I am at the hacker this is people are like well I just want the shiny Charizard to brag about so here's the six bucks on eBay on eBay right now I could buy for my Pokemon sword and shield not only is it a 6 IV GMAX Charizard but it's ultra shiny ultra shiny oh and it's only $2 677 sold 100% buyer satisfaction free shipping $1,000 $1,000 greg free shipping though it's a heck of a deal and it's timid nature it's got fire blast dragon pulse solar beam and air slash and it's ultra shiny and i use paypal credit this person also is selling an ultra shiny dusty to not ditto and ultra shiny Gengar what if what a game for kids what Indian freak just did an event where it was really easy to get to those and when you caught the ditto it gave you like destiny not to never say I'm sorry I was sick in the hospital when that event happened so so it's a ebay you go exactly 6iv perfect shiny not ultra shiny though kirim sorry I'm gonna wait for an ultra shiny to show up an eBay for two bucks this is the this is the strangest but this is like every game they like even even in like World of Warcraft there were like by my World of Warcraft account I'm level eighty I have none of that has stopped like ever but like there's you we get spam in Final Fantasy 14 to level your character up get whatever job you want up just turn the account over to so-and-so and they'll just quick do all the work like that that market has never stopped just like this market has never stopped and I don't think limiting limiting these steps that they take to limit these things is gonna do anything the problem is isn't that it can happen in game the problem is is that they're not pursuing their IP through things like eBay like this exists this has been a problem forever in the game and you aren't doing anything to stop it that is the bigger law concern then it's easier to trade in home I mean the only thing I can think of is that it might be easier to hack the home database to create quote-unquote legitimate looking on your phone into another conent have never bought their game well if you look at something like Pokemon go Pokemon masters like our there's our people hacking in coins or gems I mean they're okay there were it was like a jetpack in like first week but they fixed it but like I can't go on eBay and like buy gems on Pokemon Matt well mmm hold on and especially because of Android and androids ability to you do all kinds of yes manipulations that there's completely susceptible to these kinds of things okay at least on the first page of eBay there's nothing for Pokemon masters gems there's just a lot of Pokemon TCG cards yeah I don't know that masters has enough people playing it to make the big bucks well there are a lot of cards though I mean at least cards you get something physical well technically it's against eBay's Terms of Service to sell something digital like eBay cannot protect you against digital delivery because they cannot prove it existed so if theoretically why are we always talking about terms of service on the show we literally started terms of service podcast oh I'm in it so deep we're gonna hit a wider market finally I'll finally know all those things I just said agree yes let's do this I need to know how deep I am with China if you're selling a gift card on eBay you're supposed to physically mail them the gift card so I've run into this issue with destiny emblems huh gosh what - talk about a marketplace Wow PAX West would always have an area where you could play destiny and you would wait in line for like three hours because it's pax and then when you get in there you would play a match of crucible which would be like seven minutes and then when you're done you would get an exclusive emblem and it was just a postcard with a picture of the emblem and then it was like a 12-digit code and then you would go into destiny he would go to Bungie dot whatever net and bungie.net you would sign into your playstation or xbox account you would hit redeem code you would punch in the set the 12 digit code and then it would give you an exclusive emblem in destiny on these emblems were the things that cost money if it was worth it to you and you didn't care about destiny or you could sucker your friends into waiting in line with you you would wait in line to play destiny at PAX you would get the emblem for yourself you would have your friends that didn't care about destiny give you the emblems and these emblems at the time they went from anywhere between 50 to 250 dollars because destiny players wanted to collect these emblems I was a part of this I'm I was a monster I apologize I realized my odd I realized but because I cared about collecting everything in destiny like I ironically I care about collecting things in Pokemon I did not feel like I did not feel like I was getting scammed in a way of if I go to ebay and I see perfect 6iv all caps legit Charizard $1.99 600 sold right because I knew where the codes were coming from and I'm paying for a code that somebody waited in line for and I would prefer them to mail it to me but because they don't want to deal with the mail they would send me the code through eBay for like you know I bought it for like 50 bucks I would redeem it at my game but if it didn't work or if it did work I could go to ebay and say like the seller never got me my item and I would win by default because eBay cannot prove that they emailed me a code and even if well they can't they can't look at the email and say like oh there's a code here but that code could have been expired before you sent it to me so eBay cannot protect against that so I when I sold codes I mailed him by night miss I mailed um me I physically mailed them and I paid the extra two bucks for the tracking number but I guess again doesn't can can't prove that that code wasn't already redeemed before I sent it which is like really weird but I eBay is ze BAE's eBay I just sent two of the wildest things her friend a crust in my ebay hunt stacked Pokemon masters 21 five-star olivia Brendon blue-red I owe s 550 dollars this is just somebody's account though this druid and fifty dollars to buy somebody's account I mean how much would you pay for a level forty Pokemon go account none cuz those sell like hotcakes nothing happens at forty what mister used to play World of Warcraft yeah what was like a high-level world Warcraft account going for like 200 bucks um like back when it was popular yeah I mean back back in its heyday I think I once it was around four hundred five hundred dollars but that's not somebody hacking an account though that is somebody putting in time to play an account to then flip it no you would say that those were hacked accounts yeah okay yes yes they were like this dude it doesn't say that they this doesn't say is stacked Pokemon masters 21 five-star characters it doesn't say they sold like 40 of these yet this just seems like a single account right now a World of Warcraft Alliance made pre owned is $45 or best offer oh I mean cuz it's Alliance not horde oh don't even like you could if you really wanted to you could probably search eBay for like like Pokemon Center birthday code because if you in Japan if you go to a Pokemon Center and you like show them your license and they're like oh you were born in July it's July well happy birthday and then they give you a code for the game and then you get like a birthday Chansey or whatever and you can redeem it in like let's go and you could usually find those on eBay for like 10 bucks but I think like that is different than just like the $2 6iv legit shiny Charizard that came with a master ball right because like one is pinging Nintendo servers to download the birthday Chansey yeah and then one just came from like pkx but like at the end of the day they're just like they're not worth anything well I guess the char [Laughter] if we go back to the Pokemon home argument if we get rid of the whole concept of they're doing this because of hacking and because of eBay and because of that what other possible reason could there be where they don't want people to trade like I just don't understand I don't know it doesn't I ate and I don't know yeah can't read their minds I wish they would say I mean I wish there was some level of transparency there well we'll keep you we'll keep you updated stay tuned for dangerous guests coming never last bit of news here is Pokemon go related you Nova's legendary elite Reshiram Zechariah and Kira I'm coming to five star raids I guess two bits of news first bit is that the Wednesday night raid hour is back so Wednesday's between 6:00 and 7:00 they turn all the braids into five-star raids so this past week was Taraki in the week before was Giratina you're correct and then this upcoming week is going to be I think Reshiram I think so trainers trainers three draconic roars can be heard in the distance one belongs to a Pokemon that is capable of scorching the world when people turned their backs on the truth another belongs to a Pokemon that can raise entire kingdoms with its electricity if ideals are not revered the final roar belongs to a Pokemon which dwells an even greater power beyond bound by extreme cold originally discovered in the universe met by trainers in pokemon black version and pokemon white version legendary pokemon pokemon Reshiram and Zekrom and kiram will make their pokemon debut in five star pokemon go debut in five star raids that's exciting because I really like those Pokemon be sure to have your remote right here okay so from Tuesday May 26 to Tuesday June 16th so what is that 20 days rest RAM will be featured in five star raids in addition Reshiram will be featured every Wednesday while in five star raids so may 27th June 3rd and June 10th from 6 to 7 Reshiram will be in raids and they do their ad for how to get a remote raid pass these these Pokemon are coming Reshiram zekrom kiram no words for black hero more white kiram what about my Victini never this leavened done Shaymin yeah true or Fionna what a shame in Jamin is a hedgehog manaphy and Fiona are not ever coming to Pokemon go I will sign and seal that in blood manaphy and phione will be forgotten by the Pokemon company international now they'll have something that takes like 40 years that you got to walk with this is a 200 thousand kilometer egg and you must use your free incubator no other incubator away without tonight how they make money what they're gonna do is they're gonna show a special manaphy incubator yeah that's how they will make money because you will put you will put the manaphy in your free incubator and you will get so frustrated that you're not hatching eggs that you will buy other incubators for the other eggs oh that is so dark and true yep wait you heard it here first hold on oh yeah he'll Dodd we're supposed to be voting on Twitter correct oh yeah yeah that's this week oast to start today the 23rd to the 24th it is know where their site am i missing it am i missing this place we vote the last thing i thought was from 16 hours ago saying hey look at squirtle I don't know am i voting for wishfully voting for who gets in the next community day I think they'll probably would they not start the voting when community starts so the community hasn't started in New Zealand yet as of this recording but it's only through Twitter right but you only vote through Twitter so why does the community is people accessing their phone doesn't well they're doing the 24 hour thing right yeah so I would assume that the voting would exist through the 24 hour YouTube thing so they reminding people through the YouTube video to like vote and so they're probably gonna start with New Zealand's community starts which is the night it knows what happens New Zealand yeah everyone knows because when it breaks in New Zealand people then have their expectations for when their communities yep that's exactly what happens okay giorgia true all right question of the week it's something unpredictable that comes at the end of podcast now let's have that question asked I almost had it at the beginning and then you lost me at the end ooh lots of questions this week yeah I try to time it so that it doesn't disappear cuz certain things move very fast this is from Katherine wild speculation will we have Pokemon go integration sorry well we have pokemon home integration for go before or after the dlc drops researcher oh absolutely after after that are not ready for that yeah I don't think I I think with as much that Pokemon go is trying to do to do at home stuff and all the other things and all the raid stuff like they are willing to put that off until now that we're so close to the DLC coming like they don't want necessarily overlap those two messaging so I imagine that we'll probably hear about home integration in July I always thought home and ger integration was gonna be like knee antics summer thing yeah that was last year when we thought we'd have a summer yeah we don't have a summer what's that Green Day yeah it was a green dip here oh nice okay cuz like summer is when the antic likes to roll out new things yep yeah because people are outdoors enjoying the outdoors I think summer but I also think that what come on home is not like it's still so hard to recommend Pokemon home like if somebody came into if somebody came up to me and they're like man I love Pokemon I've been hearing about Pokemon home love to store my Pokemon you think it's worth the sixteen dollars a year it's so hard for me to say like yep totally is because it's it's a it's an easier question to answer if you're like well I already used Pokemon bank and my Pokemon bank is full so do you think it's worth it like yeah cuz its more storage yeah if you have like 200 Pokemon is Pokemon home worth it for 16 bucks a year I don't know oh heck now for me it is but for a casual pokemon person is so hard to recommend Pokemon home at this point yeah I mean I think home is really a hard core you really into it and you're really into keeping them and you're really into tracking them and I mean it's like I mean it's only 16 bucks but that that seems like if you aren't gonna use it a lot that is a waste really want that McGee Rinna I still haven't gotten that McGee Reena I saw I did but look there's a lot that I haven't done well Pokemon of the week well okay last week's Pokemon of the week it was either hard or not hard you know either got it or you didn't although I did hear that I threw people off by describing it as a delightful Pokemon because people just take me at face value as opposed to sarcastic lessons-learned folk if I'm gonna do sarcasm if I got the option it was first revealed in the Pokemon cartoon on May 8th 2003 so you think about what series was happening at that point in time and it has its evolution is based on its personality value much like spin to spots and unknowns letter and the calculation is based on the mathematical principle of modulo which if you don't know what modulo is it's where you divide two numbers and then the modulo is the remainder when you use the remainder for your calculation and you had to you have to have a modulo greater than four and then there's all kinds of weird things that can happen with breeding because the final evolution can breed for a completely different Pokemon so who's that Pokemon folks it's Lulu yeah that's real oh no I'm sorry I wrote down its cascoon and I'm pretty sure I was right but now I'm not sure you are corrected as cascoon and I specifically said this week's delightful Pokemon because Steve is always like nobody likes casts Kim I find it delightful I like its little angry little eyes no like so Khun sweetie how dare you you're so full of anger towards my beautiful wonderful unique misty he hates bug-type yeah how much is cat-scan going for on eBay mmm $500 my ultra shiny cash goon perfect Ivy's is there everyone for sale no no come on Pokemon cascoon uncommon reverse holo lost Thunder $1 24 lost Thunder there yeah there's a lot of lost thunders maybe know what that is that's Q and shares its category with Metapod kikuna and silcoon they are all known as the cocoon Pokemon cascoon and silcoon have the same exact type base stat moveset shape making them nearly identical cascoon along with silcoon can be seen without limit protrusion in their body via the anime all main series games from X&Y onward and occasionally in heartgold SoulSilver that means like in older games they were very spiky and in newer games they're not spiky but they can become spiky through their animation hmm yep cascoon is he all real weird yeah it is weird cascoon is the only Pokemon found in friend Safari that's not its own type it is found in the poison-type friend Safari even though cascoon is a pure bug type however it does evolve into the poison-type pokémon dustox that cutie man friend Safari was you want to talk about garbage ways of transferring Pokemon let me tell you about fact friend Safari Safari I will take these limits you to only six Pokemon at a time it you had to shoot with a bow and arrow no no that wasn't price apart that was that were answered black and white the transport lab yeah it was terrible but transport lab didn't have a limit transport lab was a Musso heartgold SoulSilver didn't have a limit either it was diamond pearl and I think platinum where you could only do like six Pokemon a day or something but they lifted that and heartgold SoulSilver where you could do unlimited cuz i sat on a plane one time I transferred a 200 Pokemon Lane a plane is uh it's it's like a lugia okay uh I thought we lived in Minnesota Oh oh yeah okay yeah that make sense isn't this a plane yeah or it's a prairie okay prairie little houses on the Prairie is that all the trivia we got a shuffle icon shuffle icon is sweet okay for this week's Pokemon of the week I decided to make it very very easy for everyone yes Jetta no finally it is one sentence oh just pay attention to this one sentence and you will be able to guess this is you know the letter thing again after write this down dish no letter is you don't have to write anything down just listen to the one sentence that I am about to speak my pokedex indicates that on July 22nd 2017 I was walking down South Michigan Avenue to meet up with SBJ at burger bar Chicago where the air conditioning was not working for a local fan event when I was told that this psychic flying-type quasi bird had been spotted above Buckingham Fountain which seemed appropriate as it is known as the Lord of the Seas there you go one sentence you
