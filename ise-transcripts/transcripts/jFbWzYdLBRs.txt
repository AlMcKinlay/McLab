what's up everyone welcome to the two hundred and first uno episode of the Pokemon podcast it's super effective my name is SBJ and with me today i have wheel super tired will yeah we're doing you super sleepy coming off almost two-hour episode from last week our live anniversary show so hopefully you guys caught and/or enjoyed that but but not both well i guess and or implies you could either catch it and enjoy it or catch it or enjoy it there yes I should apologize in advance of the audios if the audio sounds differently we had to install some new audio software to make it work with twitch last week and I just ran some updates on the current audio software so it sounds a little weird to me but in my test recordings that sounded normal so what I'm we'll just find out and I'll futz with it for next week we're just doing a smaller episode for you guys just make sure you get your fourth episode for January and yeah we are not launching our 3rd century here okay we we had a lot of fun like I think we had fun last week very well you have fun I mean depends on how you define fun it was a diversion sitting in front of a camera for two hours yeah having people comment about how old i am now you only have like two people say that and there was before is it you one hundred percent more than you just said that's okay alright um we have like what about 60 to 80 people fluctuate in and out I wanted to get my con but he's busy with work but he was moderating the chat and doing a very good job of it but anyway that we had a nice turnout for our first time on twitch and I think it's something we want to do again it's something the people in the twitch chat wanted to do again and I know a lot of people I did a poll afterwards of how many enjoyed the show and how many missed it and it was like 75 percent of people said they couldn't actually make the show so obviously there's a lot more people that could have been watching if if we were to do it in the future obviously different times some players a horrible rumor going around that if the patreon makes more money that we have to do a weekly stream or something like that yeah horrifying yeah so let's just get the patreon stuff out of the way if you obviously if you're new listener I ignore this but if you're not if you're an older well I have your new listener you can you can keep listening but we do a patreon over at patreon.com / it's super effective and if you care to throw a dollar a month our way you get access to our slack community and if you give us four dollars a month which is one dollar per episode you get access to our gold channel which bar beagle channel so good it's going skull so four dollars a month gets you access to the gold exclusive channel and slack which is its it's been fun it's a smaller it's like I think only like 18 or 20 people it's a lot smaller than the main channels which is over a hundred people at this point but yeah that enables you to make fun of the people in the other channels no no that doesn't happen just well you don't know though cuz you're not gold well the listener maybe not be go we're both Gould obvious obviously um I remember yeah a little side story we I installed this cat facts pot so every 24 hours it would deliver I fact about cats automatically into the slice channel and if you hit it you could you could bring it up your sub by hitting / cat facts and it would provide you a cat fact if you needed in that moment and it was probably only active for a day or two but um I was like well I don't have any this was right one gold the gold channel first got created I was like I don't have any benefits and no one's really using cat facts so i'm going to move cat facts into the gold channel as a gold member benefit and boy the slack community really Rida dat that people have to have their their dubious cat facts that's right well it is a gold perk or cult members had facts there well how was your weekend before we uh 1 2 3 4 5 about 7 news articles to run down but before we poke my news articles but before we do that we'll how's your weekend yeah why would we talk about Pokemon we can not allowed to we're obligated by the pokemon company not to talk about pokemon for the first 10 minutes so what's the rundown of the weekend we had iron banner the IB arm iron banner to get through I'd watch a lot of new heart which I enjoy watching that old sitcom gem from the 80s and finished a crochet project and then last night you and I played playstation together where we basically didn't talk to each other and played two completely different games but we were connected through the headset I think you and I did that for about three or four hours yep said about five words I listen to you watch youtube videos well it was it was mostly you being upset about your iron banner games I got real foul language should but I learned it from you so you can't lie all those swears were things that I've heard you say when you were playing destiny I'm a bad influence that is very true and then today I had I went out to Joe's house he lives about an hour east of me and we stopped by a game shop that's by him I picked up some trial vanguard deck because I haven't played Vanguard in a real long time and we just played vanguard for a couple hours give some new mechanics in there which were a little tricky that didn't quite understand but it's still fun awesome i have i've never played Vanguard but I'm sure it's good no no is it better than that runner net runners pretty good well thing about Vanguard is like us in the world of TCG's it's it can be really complicated and simple at the same time I don't know how to explain that part of it but it's like each card has its own rule the rules really are just in the cards and so each card introduces its own set of rules so if you like when you're playing for the first time you have to literally like hold the card up to your face and read through the entire thing to understand what it's doing and how it affects what you're trying to do and then they've added this whole new mechanic in the path because I haven't played in like two years and this new mechanic of the the g'zone is what it's called and it's kind of like what in other games I guess would have been called a dock or you have a set of cards that aren't part of your deck a dog a dock no not a donk a doc it's on the side and you draw from it at certain points in the actual game but that's still the fundamental Vanguard is the same ah either way Joe beat me at every single game that we played so so there you go vintage show hey you know real quick Annapolis is lovely so all right nice to go out there while you were pioneer infuriating iron banner which I I took care of that this morning finished all my rank fives you got everybody to five yeah Wow it only took like 50 games but last night well well well was playing our banner I was playing a game called the witness which i believe is on ps4 and steam those are your two options is that a game where you go door-to-door and you try to get people to read your magazine no that sounds not I don't think it sounds more exciting the witness is a puzzle game made by the guy who made braids and I believe from what I've read he spent eight years making the game and there's over 500 puzzles in the game and they're all lying puzzles so the the simplest puzzle would be um draw a line from the start to the end and avoid the brakes in the map and then the first and then the game will introduce you rule so the first rule you learn is you have to separate the black squares from the white squares kind of sounds a little racist but it's not but so you have to draw your line between them and when you get to the end all the black squares have to be on one side all the white squares have to be in the other side then the second rule they introduced to you is these little like pac-man pellets where you have to draw a line and pick up all the pellets before you get to the end of it and then it gets more complex where now you have to not only separate the black and the white squares but you have to pick up the pellets along the way and if you're imagining this you can't go over the line you've already drawn it's blocked off so you only have so much room to solve the puzzle the game gets more complicated from that but I was very determined i'm completing it last night mostly because i wanted to see the ending and i just wanted to you know get it off get off my plate for games that are coming up but i really enjoyed it I think it's great it's a it's it's 39 99 on PSN when I bought it which it came out last Tuesday I think it's a great game if you like puzzles if you don't like puzzles probably not your cup of tea because when you do something that is rewarding as in solving a very complicated puzzle or figuring it out it rewards you with more puzzles so if you don't like puzzles probably not for you I've been told and I haven't played played it but I've been told it's similar to mist in a way well I'll be the judge of that since I played like four out of the five versions of mr. so yeah I've never played missed so I can't really compare it but I'm sure I would like it but that was the game I've been playing and besides destiny and i'll probably be getting back into monster hunter this week since iron banner will be over and the iron banner slack where the iron Bay the monster hunter slack community the slack chant channel 4 monster hunter in our pokemon community is still blowing up so that's awesome that you guys are still doing that and the way I got past a like a roadblock I had had in monster hunter so now i'm i'm all in I'm having a great time I've been I got that coochie coochie monster I killed and now they're like go get the the yen watch snatchy and I'm like all for it I'm ready to do it alright alright well speaking of monsters we are here to talk about the pocket monsters otherwise known as Pokemon yes full circle here we'll jump right into some news first bit of news here is the pokemon johto league champions the complete collection will be released in north america in april 26 that box set will include over 20 hours of content and a little bit more details pokemon johto league champions complete collection is the complete DVD boxset for the fourth dubbed pokemon season will released on april 26 and the box set has a total run time of one thousand two hundred and twenty minutes twenty hours and five discs of content and that's pokemon johto oh my yeah it has a real good theme song yeah it does it's a whole new dude some non US news here mew distribution in belgium and the netherlands are going to be done by game mania that event will start on februari first so unless you are listening to this very late you'll probably already get that yeah and if if you're in belgium go out your front door and turn left and walk down a block if you're in the netherlands go out your front door and turn right and go down a block pretty much pretty sure that's how the geography of belgium and the netherlands are and game manias like right on the border between both of them oh really yeah amazing it says the codes will be available from februari first to februari 24th game mania recommends people to take their 3ds or tds with them to get you but it also states that someone is unable to bring their Nintendo 3ds four tds they can get a voucher that will have a unique serial code instead so I think they're saying this because if they run out of ouch errs you don't waste your trip so there I guess there'll be some sort of wireless distribution yep that's what I'm is as well more news here poken tournament championship series has been announced events will be held at the US National Championship which will we have news about that too and it will also be held at evo 2016 yeah so Eva was something i haven't mentioned about two episodes ago where that's where you're serious fighting game people are evo is where the street fighter and the soul calibur and the tekken and the killer instinct trying to think of fighting games those are where the best of the best go to compete so pokin will be represented there as well as net the National in the National Championships that will be taking place in July 3rd 1st through 3rd won't get to that in a bit the news here says another pokemon tournament championship series is going to be held at the evo Championship a fighting game a fighting video game event that is held in Las Vegas Nevada from July fifteenth through the 17th 2016 this will be the first time the Pokemon arcade game will be hosted at evo so not much details there but if you go to evo or you're planning on getting serious in poking tournament it might be a might be up your alley as yeah I guess they'll be using the arcade cabinets rather than we use yeah I don't know I mean they probably will have a lot of we used Ethernet to Ethernet it together because you can Ethernet to we use for poking it's one of the last year yes sure you can do the land style yeah so that'll keep your 60 frames the complaints that I had addressed to two weeks ago was no fighting game is going to be competitive sitting at 30 frames a second so that's why you're gonna have to put you're gonna have to Ethernet those we use together to keep your 60 frames which I'm sure though in that situation obviously that is the obvious road they're going to go down some other immune is the 20th anniversary mu distribution was announced for Europe this is also going to affect listeners in the UK Italy Germany Switzerland Austria and Spain the 20th anniversary miu will be distributed via serial code at retailers in all the countries i've listed above

to that and in spain em you will be available at game same as the United Kingdom so there you go get your muon because uh we don't know when mu is coming back after this yeah you does not come aberrant come around very often no no he doesn't that need to get yourself some use probably the biggest news over the past week is a new game the great detective Pikachu to be released in japan on februari third the new game great detective Pikachu birth of a new duo that is the entire title of the game as a cinematic adventure game that will be released in japan on november I'm sorry released on the Nintendo eShop on februari third the game is developed by creatures inc and will be published by the pokemon company from january 27th to februari 29th the game can be purchased in japan for twelve hundred yen instead of the normal price of 1500 yen the game is already available for pre download in the game a boy named Tim Goodman comes to rhyme City to make to meet the great detective Pikachu thus Pikachu is able to talk and where deerstalker a kind of hat associated with sure like I didn't know that's what the hell was called yeah it is the deers that's a cool hat name but even with their flaps that you tie up right there on top of the head I thought it was just called a detective hat ah it's called a deerstalker hang that's real cool a game is an issue this is just some that's just some commercial information so yeah it's a downloadable game this was a game we saw almost two years ago it was like a talked about two years ago yeah just talked about was rumored and then it went off everyone's radar and they are they brought it back so I would imagine for you know 12 $15 it's not terribly long game and without getting a physical release I'm sure it's just a cute little side project that they're doing that that'll probably be fun and I think um from what i heard the video or like the rhyme city is actually boston oh really yeah i don't know i mean i've never paid much attention even when i was in Boston so there is a no release date outside of Japan at this point so we don't know if it would ever come to the States but I would imagine because if because it's pokemons 20th anniversary this year that that we would be seeing it probably later this year well I can I don't know if you have a news item about the the what is that thing it's like everybody signs it bunch of signatures on there oh I don't want to talk about how dumb that is ok I do want to talk about how dumb that is because if if you are signing that to have the voice of a damn davido detective Pikachu be Danny DeVito III don't know you I don't I think Danny DeVito is there's nothing to do with children and and goodness and no no yeah you're not a not very maybe I mean maybe he is in his personal life but at least on the TV shows he's on he's not very child-friendly so to talk about this real quick because he brought it up there is a online petition for danny d and that's the word I was Danny DeVito to be the voice of Detective Pikachu since this pikachu will be actually talking let me tell you why it's dumb name one online petition that has been successful I mean a couple of the things that change.org does that those are successful are they well I signed one that I'm not going to talk about but yeah it was successful I mean there was like the most recent dumb online petition was to get rid of Metroid hunters or whatever that game they showed at e3 last year it was like this was the metroid game we didn't want nintendo we're making a petition so you guys stop making it now it's a nice dumb yeah yeah I can't think of an online I can't think of a online petition that has affected stuff that I directly like in life to be successful and I can tell you right now Danny DeVito's not going to be the voice the detective picture you know who make a great voice for detective Pikachu our friend Jake bake he can do lots of voices that's true fake fake I mean you're you're making your so besides the fact that all I'm petitioning is pretty much dumb like if you want anything to be if you want anything to have merit and carry weight a phone call does that better and a written letter does that better just going to a website and signing your name doesn't hold much merit but the the petition is saying one all these people want Danny DeVito even though who knows if Pokemon company has probably already picked someone in mind but to you're under the assumption that he wants to do it it would be it would be a totally different story if he would have tweeted man would I like to be the voice actor of Pikachu but he didn't you have two parties that I have zero communication with each other and people are making a petition saying this should happen and it's not it's it's dumb well there you go thank you you you know you know I'm signing up addition to make a bogota the voice of Detective Pikachu I will tweet that I want to be the voice of Detective Pikachu and then you guys can make petition hmm i don't want here a little too young that nobody would actually believe that you could be a detective that's yeah I I don't own a deerstalker hat that's my first problem do you own a magnifying glass uh yeah its voice one for like iPhones okay okay but it does magnify and let up have you ever read an encyclopedia brown book no but I know what a dictionary is all right well encyclopedia brown is a character he's a person all right I was a detective see a boy attractive kind of like a hardy boy but lay better I've played professor layton that hole that he wait I've never played detective late and I don't know or professor Lopez relating yeah isn't that just a puzzle game it is it is what you're solving it he is like a French Sherlock Holmes does he wear a deerstalker know yours a top hat I believe the little boy and professor layton wears a deerstalker know the little boy wears a newsboy cap oh yeah or in some cultures a kangal a Kangol a yes we're learning all about pets the sense it's baby I maybe it's called a page boy hmm i know i have one do you have a do you have a deer soccer do not have a deerstalker Oh page boys a haircut uh yeah no I bought like a Kangol hat when I was in Austin one time now that's different that's different angles a brand anyways I think it's a newsboy cap there you go just go with that one with that oh yeah newsboy cap I see well you can wear all your dear soccer's your news boys and York angles to the 2016 Pokemon US national championships are you ready to go back to Indiana will uh well I would be if that's where the national championships were going to be held but not where they're gonna be held thought I was gonna throw you off their obvious I am on top you are on top of the news this is the first time and I don't know how many years six seven maybe it way longer um at least since I've been following it the US the 2016 Pokemon US national championships will be held between july first and july third at the Greater Columbus Convention Center in columbus ohio this will include the TCG the video game and pokin tournament competitions since 2010 the u.s. national championship was consistently held at the indian it indiana convention center in indianapolis indiana the reason for the move has not officially been stated they tuned for more details that's kind of big news i think uh it is um and you know i can i can go back to things I've said previous on previous episodes about how I've grown comfortable with Indianapolis and now you're throwing it over to Columbus yes you're also leaving me about two hours on my drive so you know it's going from a 10 hour drive to an eight hour drive that's four hours total from there back yeah but they're like days apart so it doesn't make that much different um and and I looked at the hotel information for Columbus and I was no bueno not not too pleased what was what was the deets why I'm out here well they do have so they have a hotel that's connected to the convention center which is obviously the one that you want to get a hotel room at and it's like the cheapest room i think was like two hundred dollars a night ah which is more than we're paying for our gencon hotels well you guys got a good dr kinda got shafted what do you mean you got a hotel and down down indiana yeah but now I'm separated from you guys well dump your hotel and come stake 10 miles away with us I mean I can I got pay fifty dollars to dump it what's 52 hours it's a fifty-dollar cancellation fee yeah but what's fifty dollars tu I mean I have to check the wyndham still has hotels but i just spent forty dollars in a video game that you played in three days that you'll never play ever again 40 yeah we're dollars and you're out there in the hotel with us 7 a grand old time that's true but i was thinking also that if i do the podcast thing this year Oh presumptuous well yeah you know meaning that i won't be like what if but now you know this is getting a little inside baseball as they like to say I'm the co-host of your other podcast what if they like me better what if they want me to come podcast I mean yeah why not because I've got a hotel that's 11 miles away and obviously by your criteria that's too far for podcasting I mean that I made it work lat I'm just like I made it work last year but I didn't work because I drove and I Snyder I sign in the morning to drive you home say I don't want to inconvenience anyone I understand we're getting we're gonna we're getting off topic here uh 200 out of the night that's expensive yeah but I'm sure Columbus is a lovely place to ensure there's other hotel so I want to say when I when I stayed at nationals three years ago stay it was Irene and I and a friend and his girlfriend and we stay at the Marriott which is connected to the Indianapolis convention center which Mary I was very nice hotel i believe it was 169 a night obviously if you split that in half only pain like 90 bucks after tax a night and three nights that's not too bad but 200 bucks oh yeah and you want to get there a day early and you want to stay a day extra but that's a two hours extra on my drive two hours less on your drive so now we're eat we're equally eight hours apart each yeah I don't know anything about Columbus you know it could be that there's plenty of hotels in that area or it could be like Fort Wayne and you have to drive from every hotel no matter where it is I would be curious to look up the Indianapolis convention center and see if somebody paid more money and/or booked those dates already intriguing and pokemon just didn't wanna pony up the cash for it unless our new thing is just to move convention centers for like to get more people to come you know it's very easy for people in Indiana to go to Pokemon set this right there but you know two hours is is a no pun intended a roadblock for a lot of people really two hours I mean if you're if it's in your town it finally you really have no reason not to go whereas if it's two hours away that's that's enough to say I'm not really ready my teams already I can't afford a hotel you know I mean well I know what I that there's nothing scheduled in the Indianapolis convention center for the July fourth weekend so maybe that's not posted yet I'm done we got a lot of stuff posted yeah I don't know it's interesting it's interesting we got one more bit of news here are we still up in the air you're are you committed to not going or you're still iffy or NAT for us nationals yeah a man it's so hard to in this meta to get a team together yeah I hear it well I mean there's also TCG and pokin you got two other options I did I am worse at the pokemon TCG than I am at Vanguard so I mean and there then I got the no break mechanic in there and yeah oh yeah i'm at my big my big problem with Nationals is always so close to gencon yeah I knew and there they were I well for the past six years they were on the same location obviously not now Nationals is farther for me but when you're spending a thousand dollars at gencon just for housing or hotels alone plus the time or plus the time to get off it's it's hard to swing both and I'm not gonna lie gencon is a fuller experience in every aspect then the name and then they do have pokemon at gencon but they don't have Pathfinder it i think i think the problem so the problem with Nationals is a couple things you either have to be really competitive in either the TCG of the video game and if you're not which is fine but if you are I'll get to the not if you are your whole day is wake up early play your match wait anywhere between ten minutes to an hour you can't do much because you're waiting results play your next match rinse and repeat and almost always almost always you get screwed on lunch yeah like they the tournament organizers haven't figured out like your day is stressful and if it's not that's cool like you're calm collected player but I would say the majority of people competing are stressed lunch is like the one Savior to your day and you almost always get screwed up so you look at the notes if there's a shopping mall connected to the Columbus Convention Center yeah I don't I don't know what the food that you ate at chick-fil-a chick-fil-a right yeah um so now you you on the other so your days are full if you're competing competitively your days are full readers how much you're gonna do besides compete and then usually by the time competitions over your kind of pooped out you're done that wraps up I mean they wrapped up at like seven or eight last year I feel like from what I got pretty late and inside you can stay up or do anything because you are on a schedule of okay we need to be up by 9am its tournament starts at ten well blah so let's go to the other aspect you're going there for the love of Pokemon you're not competing competitively unfortunately there's not much for you to do like you can play inside things but how it's this like that to me to playing a side thing that's like two hours of entertainment that's like three hours of entertainment that is not an eight hour event that I want to sit at and then the other aspects oh well there's there's pokemon stuff I can buy and / might've from the last four years that I went it was not official pokemon stuff it was like four vendors with up marked pokemon stuff that they imported from Japan or that they found on ebay that they're selling it the they're just like two rooms of small vendors not a me I hate don't get me wrong I love to spend money especially I'm pokemon stuff but none of that even appealed to me to buy well yeah I mean it's mostly intended like if you want to buy select cards right specific cards or if you want to sell all your cards as i know someone did one year but you know saying all that if a bunch of dudes wants to get together and do road trip and pile into a hotel room I could still be convinced to go yeah I mean I could be convinced but i like it like i said if they weren't so close it be an easier argument well at least with the gencon it's like I wake up when I want to stay up what i want i'm not on the schedule i'm not feeling competitive so many things to do so I mean that's why it wins out to me plus there is the pokemon stuff there's hundreds of street passes every hour that you can get there are oh yeah like you battled it select this tons of Pokemon cosplay like it's very easy to find a battle if you want there's a TCG sit like and that's well that's the only reason why I'm comparing is because it's not like I'm going to Jen come to ignore pokemon but there is a Pokemon presence at gencon and so to me that's where I want to put my time my vacation to my money in because I'm going to get a more rich experience yeah because you can play pokemon and you can play the WWE superstars game the Thrive which i saw in the store today and almost bought but stopped myself I was angry I woke up this morning no joke no joke I woke up this morning and I was like I think I'm going to take the shrink wrap off and actually sit down and read the rulebook because I I got that itch to play it's a good game it's not a bad game it's not about him I mean it's made by the same people who made the Firefly board game which is very very popular last bit of news here the season 17 and movie 17 coming to netflix on februari first the 17th season of the pokemon anime Pokemon the series X Y and the 17th movie the ants and the cocoon of destruction will be added to netflix catalog on februari first 2016 and that's pretty much all the news there i mean well i'm glad they're doing that because they're getting rid of Doctor Who and they're actually putting something good on there you go I'm getting I like Doctor Who uh-huh sad to see it go off netflix but i've never seen the dancing movie so yeah I've not seen the dancing movie I want to see that Irene just renewed our netflix subscription I actually cancelled it like a year ago I was so tired of paying 10 bucks a month for not watching anything but she's now paying the ten dollars when I was Jesse's mind as I don't ever watch next place oh yeah I already stole your hulu that's true I would be I'm very very interested in seeing Pokemon the series X&Y after you talk so highly about it well so yeah oh man it's so good I'm it maybe I'll I was gonna maybe I'll started tonight but I gotta wait like 10 more hours or to show up oh yeah not getting very first yet it does say the older movies and the older episodes would be removed i think the only episodes that were remaining was black and white stuff and who needs that black and white was terrible that's not true and i don't understand these series where they like they'll do like oh our first three seasons are on hulu and our next four seasons are on netflix and then we've got like two seasons are online only on our app and like why can't everything just be in one place you know I feel so there are over 700 episodes of the Pokemon anime maybe even more I'm just trying to add numbers in my head and there are you know 19 movies Pokemon could in theory do its own network for like four ninety-nine a month to watch it all oh yeah they got more collateral than the WWE they could do it I mean IIIi think I think they could pull it off and I 999 would be steep for unlimited Pokemon I mean you couldn't consume that you couldn't consume that in a weekend or a week or anything like that but I think 499 would be a I would feel comfortable paying for a Pokemon TV app that just gives me all of it no this is what we need we need a Pokemon app call it Pokemon TV call it what you want but it's going to have all the seasons of all the cartoon shows every episode it's going to have all the movies and it's going to do streaming like the WWE app does where they have their own shows that are like these short form shows if they've put together and documentaries or whatever there'll be more documentaries over time and you know what else is going to feature it's going to feature Pokemon podcast it's super effective sweet to our block it's gonna have Kyle suka he'll do or like a TCG insiders look kind of show uh I don't know it has some of them VGC youtubers get on there they'll have their own shows and then we'll all be rich right it'll cost them very little money it'll put a lot of money into my pocket and everyone's gonna be happy cuz it's got me like you could just turn on Pokemon TV and veg out and have a good old time and like breed your pokemons Pokemon battles just have pokemon TV on in front of you you're not wrong yes I mean the Pokemon TV app already exists and it already gives you what do they rotate the rotate episodes out every two weeks and it's usually 10 free episodes and they do like four different seasons like five episodes from four different seas yes i'm jania slee all you have to do is add a upgrade button for
