City (2:20 - 2:22)
um we have a show for you guys today (2:24 - 2:28)
there was there's a lot of Pokemon news (2:26 - 2:31)
we're just gonna focus on um I don't (2:28 - 2:32)
know I guess the three big things to the (2:31 - 2:33)
Nintendo Direct (2:32 - 2:36)
and then uh Pokemon anime is coming back (2:33 - 2:39)
there was Pokemon information in a (2:36 - 2:44)
Nintendo Direct was how that is not a (2:39 - 2:45)
thing that happens because because (2:44 - 2:48)
unlike people on the internet we don't (2:45 - 2:51)
move the goal post here (2:48 - 2:53)
that's why (2:51 - 2:55)
um yeah like this conversation happens (2:53 - 2:57)
every time there's a Pokemon the (2:55 - 2:58)
Nintendo Direct people are like don't (2:57 - 3:00)
expect any Pokemon news and you know for (2:58 - 3:02)
the most part (3:00 - 3:03)
there (3:02 - 3:07)
are Pokemon presents which does cover (3:03 - 3:09)
but that doesn't ever mean that there's (3:07 - 3:12)
not Pokemon news like this year alone (3:09 - 3:14)
they showed stadium and they showed the (3:12 - 3:17)
TCG and they showed uh (3:14 - 3:19)
something else that was Virtual Console (3:17 - 3:23)
related that I'm blanking on and (3:19 - 3:25)
like that is Pokemon news whether or not (3:23 - 3:27)
you care about it that's your own (3:25 - 3:28)
problem but to be like they never show (3:27 - 3:30)
Pokemon news and I'm like hey they just (3:28 - 3:32)
talked about the TCG thing on Virtual (3:30 - 3:33)
Console or no it's not even called (3:32 - 3:34)
Virtual Console anymore I don't know (3:33 - 3:36)
what's called (3:34 - 3:36)
um (3:36 - 3:39)
they're like well that doesn't count (3:36 - 3:42)
like what you said Pokemon news like (3:39 - 3:44)
don't move the goal post on me like uh (3:42 - 3:47)
no main series by my definition Pokemon (3:44 - 3:50)
news that excludes things that I don't (3:47 - 3:53)
consider main series or add-ons yeah (3:50 - 3:55)
yeah also please sign this addendum so (3:53 - 3:57)
that you know exactly what I'm talking (3:55 - 3:59)
about and don't read the vibrant thank (3:57 - 4:00)
you very much (3:59 - 4:02)
so yeah there's (4:00 - 4:03)
um (4:02 - 4:06)
I mean even when you know my personal (4:03 - 4:08)
opinion I guess we're talking I guess (4:06 - 4:09)
we're going to talk about the we'll (4:08 - 4:11)
we'll start with here (4:09 - 4:13)
let's not start with a trailer because I (4:11 - 4:14)
have my own thoughts about the trailer (4:13 - 4:16)
let's start with Detective Pikachu (4:14 - 4:19)
that's where we're gonna start off with (4:16 - 4:21)
because that was probably the actual (4:19 - 4:24)
shocker getting a trailer for scarlet (4:21 - 4:26)
and violet not that shocker nor was (4:24 - 4:28)
anything very shocking in that trailer (4:26 - 4:31)
moment (4:28 - 4:31)
um (4:32 - 4:37)
but uh detective Pikachu was shown off (4:33 - 4:39)
here uh it says this is the press (4:37 - 4:41)
release we have during a Nintendo Direct (4:39 - 4:43)
the Pokemon company International and (4:41 - 4:45)
Nintendo announced that detective (4:43 - 4:47)
Pikachu returns exclusively to the (4:45 - 4:51)
Nintendo switch on October 6. so (4:47 - 4:54)
hopefully Janine and her calendar we can (4:51 - 4:56)
rule out that there will be no DLC (4:54 - 4:58)
coming out this weekend but hey you (4:56 - 5:01)
never know you never know that is uh (4:58 - 5:03)
that is a that is a leap that I am not (5:01 - 5:06)
along with right now didn't they (5:03 - 5:10)
they released new Pokemon Snap if I (5:06 - 5:12)
remember correctly and that same weekend (5:10 - 5:14)
there was a brand new (5:12 - 5:17)
Berserker or gallerian miatry yeah I (5:14 - 5:20)
think it was preserker (5:17 - 5:23)
and that was frustrating (5:20 - 5:23)
and if I if I was to actually look at (5:24 - 5:28)
the calendar I'm sure there was a (5:27 - 5:32)
Pokemon go event that weekend too (5:28 - 5:32)
that's all in the past (5:32 - 5:36)
um (5:35 - 5:40)
detective Pikachu returns coming soon uh (5:36 - 5:43)
this new title once again Stars the one (5:40 - 5:45)
and only tough talking coffee loving (5:43 - 5:48)
detective Pikachu and his trusty partner (5:45 - 5:52)
Mr Tim Goodman uh with the help of many (5:48 - 5:54)
other Pokemon Tim and Pikachu work (5:52 - 5:56)
together to solve a series of incidents (5:54 - 5:58)
that are occurring in rhyme City a place (5:56 - 6:00)
where humans and Pokemon live side by (5:58 - 6:03)
side okay I'm just gonna preference this (6:00 - 6:06)
the first detective Pikachu game is six (6:03 - 6:09)
years old and there was a movie (6:06 - 6:11)
so if for some reason in the last six (6:09 - 6:14)
years you decided not to play detective (6:11 - 6:15)
Pikachu (6:14 - 6:19)
ah this is your spoiler warning because (6:15 - 6:22)
it's been six years you can't even buy (6:19 - 6:25)
this game anymore (6:22 - 6:25)
I'm here feeling like I should have (6:26 - 6:31)
bought it before the eShop closed (6:27 - 6:31)
you could probably find it at like a the (6:32 - 6:37)
first one came out when I was living in (6:36 - 6:39)
Japan for three months and that's a game (6:37 - 6:41)
you really want to buy in English if (6:39 - 6:43)
you're not great at Japanese yeah and by (6:41 - 6:45)
the time I got back I needed that money (6:43 - 6:47)
for college so (6:45 - 6:50)
I think never played it Greg still has (6:47 - 6:52)
my copy (6:50 - 6:55)
I don't know what you're talking about (6:52 - 6:55)
a tricky detective Pikachu for Pokemon (6:56 - 7:01)
box (6:59 - 7:01)
every listener to remember that Greg has (7:03 - 7:08)
my copy of detective Pikachu wise lies (7:06 - 7:11)
and slander number two is they released (7:08 - 7:14)
a thirty dollar amiibo to go with that (7:11 - 7:17)
right and that that was that was the (7:14 - 7:19)
thing (7:17 - 7:20)
um (7:19 - 7:22)
okay so uh I was I was serious about (7:20 - 7:25)
this that we will be talking to touch of (7:22 - 7:28)
Pikachu spoilers uh Hannah before we get (7:25 - 7:31)
to spoilers does and for somebody who (7:28 - 7:32)
did not play the first game is this (7:31 - 7:34)
something you want to pick up do you (7:32 - 7:36)
have interest in also I don't remember I (7:34 - 7:37)
know you saw the movie I don't know if (7:36 - 7:38)
you liked it or not (7:37 - 7:41)
I did enjoy the movie I've bought it (7:38 - 7:42)
I've watched it multiple times since (7:41 - 7:44)
first seeing it and yes Greg has the (7:42 - 7:46)
copy (7:44 - 7:50)
from my cold dead hands (7:46 - 7:50)
I can't open up to make sure that (7:52 - 7:56)
cartridge is still in there look I take (7:54 - 7:58)
care of things (7:56 - 8:02)
taking care of your stuff you keep (7:58 - 8:03)
promising to come get a ladder you never (8:02 - 8:06)
show up you never Tuesday I'll get the (8:03 - 8:09)
ladder what if I'm dead (8:06 - 8:11)
then I will ask your husband for my copy (8:09 - 8:14)
of detective Pikachu and the ladder yeah (8:11 - 8:17)
he's not talking to you (8:14 - 8:17)
um I I did enjoy the movie (8:18 - 8:24)
I probably will play the sequel I've (8:22 - 8:26)
been thinking about watching a recap of (8:24 - 8:28)
the first one wondering if I should or (8:26 - 8:30)
if I should try to find a physical copy (8:28 - 8:33)
somewhere and just play through it (8:30 - 8:35)
I I will say I (8:33 - 8:39)
adored the first detective Pikachu minus (8:35 - 8:41)
the ending I thought it was a very fun (8:39 - 8:43)
it was uh as somebody who liked the (8:41 - 8:45)
Professor Layton games uh detective (8:43 - 8:48)
Pikachu is is like two steps below that (8:45 - 8:50)
much much easier it's much easier like (8:48 - 8:53)
the story is (8:50 - 8:57)
if you watched the movie you got most of (8:53 - 9:00)
the story with A better ending (8:57 - 9:00)
the ending of detective Pikachu just is (9:01 - 9:06)
like (9:03 - 9:06)
so you're not (9:06 - 9:11)
gonna answer those questions at all huh (9:08 - 9:13)
okay I guess they needed the sequel (9:11 - 9:15)
which for a long time looked like it was (9:13 - 9:17)
never actually gonna happen I don't know (9:15 - 9:19)
if they actually just (9:17 - 9:21)
like we're thinking we're gonna leave (9:19 - 9:23)
this kind of cliffhangerie because we (9:21 - 9:25)
know we're going to get a sequel or if (9:23 - 9:27)
they just was like we just don't want to (9:25 - 9:29)
answer these questions (9:27 - 9:31)
four questions of the game though I mean (9:29 - 9:34)
I watched the trailers yeah oh there was (9:31 - 9:36)
there's there's not a satisfying ending (9:34 - 9:38)
to that game no (9:36 - 9:40)
uh Greg is right if you watch the movie (9:38 - 9:42)
I would I (9:40 - 9:45)
I think the movie is a great (9:42 - 9:48)
version of that story even though it (9:45 - 9:50)
leaves a lot out there's like a whole (9:48 - 9:51)
festival (9:50 - 9:54)
um at the end of detective P2 that was (9:51 - 9:55)
well I guess they've changed the (9:54 - 9:57)
festival the like the festival in the (9:55 - 9:59)
game is like a nighttime Festival (9:57 - 10:01)
um there is technically like a parade at (9:59 - 10:02)
the end of (10:01 - 10:04)
the first one there's like a whole power (10:02 - 10:06)
plant thing in the game that they leave (10:04 - 10:08)
out which is like there's like a result (10:06 - 10:10)
in the movie do they go to the cruise (10:08 - 10:12)
ship no there's no cruise ship at all (10:10 - 10:15)
either look the negative Pikachu goes (10:12 - 10:17)
all sorts of locations yeah and you're (10:15 - 10:20)
like what how are we here but like the (10:17 - 10:23)
game kind of has to add like more stuff (10:20 - 10:24)
because you need to like go to new (10:23 - 10:26)
environments and like do the puzzles and (10:24 - 10:28)
stuff it's it's a it's really great it (10:26 - 10:32)
is a Charming game that ends (10:28 - 10:35)
them the one mystery (10:32 - 10:38)
ends well like you don't have any (10:35 - 10:40)
questions about the Mysteries that you (10:38 - 10:42)
are trying to solve the overarching (10:40 - 10:45)
mystery that they introduced they just (10:42 - 10:47)
this is an era of serious type of (10:45 - 10:50)
situation yeah we know those questions (10:47 - 10:53)
are we gonna answer those we'll see (10:50 - 10:57)
yeah and um so at the you know the the (10:53 - 10:59)
ones the one question in the detective (10:57 - 11:01)
Pikachu game is like you're looking for (10:59 - 11:03)
your dad and I want I don't know when it (11:01 - 11:05)
clicked with me that like oh I think the (11:03 - 11:08)
dad is Pikachu (11:05 - 11:10)
like I don't know how far into the game (11:08 - 11:14)
I was before I was like oh this is this (11:10 - 11:15)
is because like the dad loves coffee (11:14 - 11:17)
Pikachu loves coffee (11:15 - 11:19)
and then when you get to the end of the (11:17 - 11:22)
game Mewtwo's like about to ask your dad (11:19 - 11:26)
AKA Pikachu If he if he if he wants to (11:22 - 11:28)
do the thing he want he wants to do (11:26 - 11:30)
and then there's like this weird cuts (11:28 - 11:32)
and then you're like ah okay here it (11:30 - 11:33)
comes and then there's this weird (11:32 - 11:35)
there's this like weird blackout like (11:33 - 11:36)
you don't see like the choice that (11:35 - 11:39)
Pikachu makes in front of me too and (11:36 - 11:40)
then Pikachu comes back to you and was (11:39 - 11:43)
like hey Jim Goodman we got another (11:40 - 11:47)
mission to do and it was like (11:43 - 11:50)
this is the end of the game you decided (11:47 - 11:52)
not to answer the question and we have (11:50 - 11:55)
another mission to an unannounced sequel (11:52 - 11:57)
that like like six years later here it (11:55 - 12:01)
is but in the in the movie that happened (11:57 - 12:04)
Pikachu turns into the dead you're like (12:01 - 12:05)
that was it that was supposed to happen (12:04 - 12:06)
in the game (12:05 - 12:09)
I see I I don't know if (12:06 - 12:12)
I never got the sense that (12:09 - 12:14)
like in the movie like Pikachu was the (12:12 - 12:16)
dad I'm like oh this is clearly his (12:14 - 12:17)
Pikachu and he raised it in very (12:16 - 12:20)
specific ways (12:17 - 12:23)
um and in the game it is not as I don't (12:20 - 12:27)
think it's they make it as clear (12:23 - 12:29)
that it is the debt as they do in the (12:27 - 12:30)
movies obviously because the movie (12:29 - 12:31)
really had to point towards that ending (12:30 - 12:34)
and then in the (12:31 - 12:37)
game you're really hoping Mewtwo is (12:34 - 12:39)
going to answer one way or the other (12:37 - 12:41)
like just (12:39 - 12:43)
say yes or no and they do they cut away (12:41 - 12:45)
and then he comes running out and you're (12:43 - 12:47)
like (12:45 - 12:47)
and what what do you ask the question (12:49 - 12:56)
when do we get to see the question what (12:52 - 12:58)
okay and it (12:56 - 13:02)
it has one of those endings where (12:58 - 13:05)
they left they left it open and I think (13:02 - 13:07)
the way I felt was like they left it (13:05 - 13:09)
open for the possibility of a sequel not (13:07 - 13:10)
that they were sure they're gonna get (13:09 - 13:12)
one have you ever seen TV series that do (13:10 - 13:14)
that that they sort of (13:12 - 13:17)
tie up so much (13:14 - 13:19)
they have to except for a few yeah they (13:17 - 13:21)
have to leave a cliffhanger to try and (13:19 - 13:23)
get renewed right I mean that was a (13:21 - 13:26)
pretty big thing (13:23 - 13:26)
so like so I I I I see the trailer (13:27 - 13:34)
I think it looks good A good ends in (13:31 - 13:36)
like I want to play this graphically it (13:34 - 13:38)
was a little like (13:36 - 13:41)
um you were working on this on 3D srg oh (13:38 - 13:43)
yeah it definitely looks like the 3DS (13:41 - 13:46)
game and I don't know if that's like (13:43 - 13:48)
them really working hard to keep the (13:46 - 13:52)
style so they feel connected but also (13:48 - 13:54)
you you don't need to know do that we (13:52 - 13:56)
know they're (13:54 - 13:59)
separate systems scale worked pretty (13:56 - 14:02)
well for a switch game (13:59 - 14:03)
I mean it didn't look like everything (14:02 - 14:07)
was too big or too so it like I don't (14:03 - 14:09)
you know if this game looked like (14:07 - 14:12)
Skyrim 7 graphically I don't think it's (14:09 - 14:14)
gonna like sell more copies it's just (14:12 - 14:16)
like like yeah I I feel like when when (14:14 - 14:18)
that trailer hit you were either excited (14:16 - 14:22)
or you were like I don't care like I I (14:18 - 14:24)
don't know I don't know how big the (14:22 - 14:27)
market of this game is (14:24 - 14:28)
um (14:27 - 14:32)
because even when I when I played the (14:28 - 14:36)
first one it didn't when it came out in (14:32 - 14:37)
English on the 3DS it just didn't seem (14:36 - 14:40)
like a lot of people really cared like a (14:37 - 14:44)
a single player very simple puzzle game (14:40 - 14:46)
on the 3DS seemed like a pretty limited (14:44 - 14:48)
audience even with the Pokemon brand (14:46 - 14:52)
behind it according to this that I'm (14:48 - 14:55)
finding online uh as of December 31st (14:52 - 14:58)
2021 detective Pikachu sold (14:55 - 15:02)
14.93 million copies worldwide what (14:58 - 15:05)
respectable sales that is super (15:02 - 15:08)
respectable what I'm gonna see if I can (15:05 - 15:09)
find something that are you sure you're (15:08 - 15:11)
not really like the movie (15:09 - 15:15)
it would make more sense (15:11 - 15:15)
it's also like one of those games that (15:16 - 15:20)
at least to me didn't have any replay (15:18 - 15:22)
value it's not like you could it's not (15:20 - 15:24)
like tears of the Kingdom where you walk (15:22 - 15:25)
into a shrine and you're like I can (15:24 - 15:26)
solve this puzzle like five different (15:25 - 15:29)
ways right like in detective Pikachu (15:26 - 15:31)
there was kind of one way to solve every (15:29 - 15:33)
single puzzle so I mean maybe if you (15:31 - 15:35)
were like Speed Run and detective (15:33 - 15:37)
Pikachu you could replay it but like (15:35 - 15:40)
I figured out how to get the Joel tick (15:37 - 15:42)
down the power plant and then plugged (15:40 - 15:44)
into the battery like I did it uh this (15:42 - 15:45)
is a different game they're talking (15:44 - 15:47)
about what is detective Pikachu case (15:45 - 15:49)
closed (15:47 - 15:53)
uh in Japan it was three games oh okay (15:49 - 15:55)
this is what that's talking about so in (15:53 - 15:57)
Japan there was like it was like three (15:55 - 16:00)
series that they all repackaged for one (15:57 - 16:02)
cartridge for us (16:00 - 16:04)
uh I said okay so that's gonna change (16:02 - 16:05)
those numbers I'm looking for better (16:04 - 16:08)
numbers oh okay because yeah 14 million (16:05 - 16:11)
something like a whole lot (16:08 - 16:11)
now if you divide that by three (16:11 - 16:17)
what is that like (16:14 - 16:20)
sixish million (16:17 - 16:23)
14 divided by 3 is less than five oh (16:20 - 16:27)
yeah yeah uh 4.5 million 4.33 something (16:23 - 16:30)
like that yep (16:27 - 16:32)
that's still a lot yeah so yeah for (16:30 - 16:34)
those that didn't know in Japan this (16:32 - 16:38)
they they got it in a digital release I (16:34 - 16:39)
think they eventually got a cartridge (16:38 - 16:42)
but they it was like once a month for (16:39 - 16:44)
three months they got part of the story (16:42 - 16:46)
and then we had to wait almost a year (16:44 - 16:49)
after it came out in Japan for that (16:46 - 16:51)
physical release this is an old game (16:49 - 16:54)
like and when I say six years I think (16:51 - 16:55)
that's when it came out in Japan (16:54 - 16:58)
um I don't remember the us but (16:55 - 17:00)
so you go and I guess we go into this (16:58 - 17:02)
game going okay well Pikachu's the dad (17:00 - 17:05)
the movie already spoiled that (17:02 - 17:08)
and hopefully at the end of this the (17:05 - 17:10)
Pikachu turns back into the dad but (17:08 - 17:12)
we're just solving we're just solving (17:10 - 17:14)
another mystery (17:12 - 17:17)
which is kind of great if they made it a (17:14 - 17:19)
Twist and and made Pikachu not the dad (17:17 - 17:21)
in the games but they were heavily (17:19 - 17:22)
hinting at it during the trailer for the (17:21 - 17:25)
new one (17:22 - 17:25)
and I believe this game is made by (17:28 - 17:33)
creatures uh which is a division of the (17:30 - 17:35)
Pokemon company and I do know I was (17:33 - 17:38)
following a guy on Twitter who (17:35 - 17:41)
was working on this game and he was one (17:38 - 17:42)
of the English people (17:41 - 17:44)
in Japan working on this game he no (17:42 - 17:47)
longer works for creatures uh he's (17:44 - 17:52)
working on that new farming game pal (17:47 - 17:56)
the fairy thing yeah the fairy farming (17:52 - 17:58)
game that they keep showing in every (17:56 - 18:00)
Nintendo Direct (17:58 - 18:04)
I'm actually slightly interested in that (18:00 - 18:07)
yeah it looked okay (18:04 - 18:07)
yeah I I I I I don't I'm excited for (18:07 - 18:13)
detective Pikachu but like I know it (18:10 - 18:15)
also this is gonna be a 50 game (18:13 - 18:18)
um yeah it is I I know in my head that (18:15 - 18:20)
I'm going to play it once and then (18:18 - 18:23)
that's it like yep that was good like (18:20 - 18:25)
and with no desire to like Play It Again (18:23 - 18:27)
the first detective Peach she was (18:25 - 18:28)
relatively long though Long in like a (18:27 - 18:31)
good way like it didn't (18:28 - 18:34)
like like it changing areas and changing (18:31 - 18:35)
puzzles was was (18:34 - 18:38)
very helpful to the longevity of that (18:35 - 18:39)
game (18:38 - 18:42)
makes it worth it hopefully (18:39 - 18:44)
even if it's just uh once you play it (18:42 - 18:46)
you know the story and there's really no (18:44 - 18:47)
reason to play it again no there's no (18:46 - 18:50)
there's not a lot of replay value can we (18:47 - 18:52)
talk about the best part of that trailer (18:50 - 18:56)
which is the Slowpoke and the hat (18:52 - 18:56)
so let's look at the cowboy hat the (18:57 - 19:02)
cowboy-esque fedora hat we can only hope (18:59 - 19:04)
that Niantic will uh put a cowboy hat on (19:02 - 19:06)
Slowpoke then (19:04 - 19:06)
I mean it's probably gonna go into (19:07 - 19:10)
United that's the easiest way to put it (19:08 - 19:12)
in but the question is would it go on a (19:10 - 19:15)
slow bro (19:12 - 19:15)
what if the twist was the reason they (19:17 - 19:20)
held this game back for so long is (19:19 - 19:22)
because they wanted to put like gen 8 (19:20 - 19:26)
Pokemon into like military (19:22 - 19:26)
they're like we need something more for (19:27 - 19:32)
the cafe we need Cafe type Pokemon we (19:29 - 19:33)
know some are coming up so we're not (19:32 - 19:35)
gonna do this game until we get it the (19:33 - 19:37)
millsery animation took three extra (19:35 - 19:39)
years that's why we're just getting this (19:37 - 19:41)
game now yeah they've had some time for (19:39 - 19:42)
that (19:41 - 19:44)
all right there are no good places that (19:42 - 19:46)
have numbers for this game I think the (19:44 - 19:47)
problem with the number stuff that's why (19:46 - 19:48)
I was shocked I was like I don't think (19:47 - 19:51)
that 14 million is right is because (19:48 - 19:55)
we've never gotten digital numbers (19:51 - 19:57)
like we don't know when the game sells (19:55 - 19:59)
digitally unless or or if we do get (19:57 - 20:00)
digital numbers they're merged in with (19:59 - 20:02)
the physical numbers I mean there's one (20:00 - 20:05)
line that says the game sold (20:02 - 20:08)
121 122 (20:05 - 20:11)
000 units 95 retail sales and about 27 (20:08 - 20:13)
digital (20:11 - 20:15)
but then that was just for Japan and (20:13 - 20:17)
then it says in North America it was the (20:15 - 20:20)
top selling 3DS game (20:17 - 20:23)
uh in March of 2018 and then was in the (20:20 - 20:26)
top 10 food June in July it did great in (20:23 - 20:29)
UK but there are no numbers attached to (20:26 - 20:31)
that I think the number one game was (20:29 - 20:34)
also still pretty surprising (20:31 - 20:34)
I mean generally it was well received (20:34 - 20:40)
but like it's not (20:37 - 20:42)
great like most people just put it in (20:40 - 20:44)
the middle of the pack I mean that's I (20:42 - 20:46)
mean it is a middle of the pack game (20:44 - 20:47)
like there's not a sense of replay value (20:46 - 20:49)
it is pretty (20:47 - 20:51)
it's down the path that the Gabe wants (20:49 - 20:52)
you to go (20:51 - 20:55)
but it's an enjoyable little trip yeah (20:52 - 20:57)
it sounds enjoyable it sounds amusing it (20:55 - 20:59)
sounds like it's a good (20:57 - 21:01)
way to spend time for a little bit and (20:59 - 21:03)
then you're done (21:01 - 21:07)
seems like a lot yeah (21:03 - 21:11)
it seems like a whole bunch (21:07 - 21:13)
um (21:11 - 21:13)
also we have I like I I completely (21:14 - 21:18)
forgot about this but when Pikachu (21:16 - 21:20)
starts talking I was like oh yeah like (21:18 - 21:23)
he has that like rough and Gruff Voice (21:20 - 21:26)
or whatever and then I completely forgot (21:23 - 21:29)
that people made Danny DeVito jokes (21:26 - 21:33)
for for months when the first detective (21:29 - 21:34)
Pikachu came out and was like ah they (21:33 - 21:36)
should have got Danny DeVito and then I (21:34 - 21:37)
forgot that that was a thing with the (21:36 - 21:38)
movie when they're like we're casting (21:37 - 21:40)
Ryan Reynolds and people were like oh (21:38 - 21:42)
they should have got it and then all (21:40 - 21:44)
those jokes came back and I was like I (21:42 - 21:48)
was like oh yeah I forgot that you guys (21:44 - 21:51)
really took this joke and dug it into (21:48 - 21:53)
the like just just (21:51 - 21:57)
this is the only thing you got going now (21:53 - 22:00)
and you didn't play this game it's fine (21:57 - 22:03)
uh dedicated fans started petition (22:00 - 22:05)
requesting American actor Danny DeVito (22:03 - 22:07)
is the English actor for the titular (22:05 - 22:10)
character the petition gained 40 (22:07 - 22:12)
000 signatures (22:10 - 22:15)
but Davido declined to audition for the (22:12 - 22:18)
role saying he's never heard of Pokemon (22:15 - 22:21)
yeah we talked about this on the show (22:18 - 22:23)
where where Ryan Reynolds came out and (22:21 - 22:24)
he was like I really wanted to do this (22:23 - 22:26)
movie because my my daughters love (22:24 - 22:28)
Pokemon and then Danny DeVito was like I (22:26 - 22:30)
don't care about that series like why (22:28 - 22:33)
would you want an actor that doesn't (22:30 - 22:35)
care about the series you care about to (22:33 - 22:38)
do like (22:35 - 22:38)
also sometimes voice actors are better (22:39 - 22:44)
than than big name movie actors when it (22:41 - 22:47)
comes to voice acting stuff I'm not (22:44 - 22:49)
going to get started on using big name (22:47 - 22:53)
actors as well but Ryan Reynolds made (22:49 - 22:57)
sense because he shows up at the end no (22:53 - 22:58)
I mean for the movie The Way They went (22:57 - 23:00)
with it it's it's (22:58 - 23:04)
fine but like I have I have an issue (23:00 - 23:06)
with the direction that a lot of voice (23:04 - 23:07)
acting is taking where they are just (23:06 - 23:09)
hiring actors who don't attempt to (23:07 - 23:12)
change their voice in any way to create (23:09 - 23:13)
a new character and when they do (23:12 - 23:15)
multiple movies and they always sound (23:13 - 23:19)
the same it's really not (23:15 - 23:22)
it isn't as effective as when you can (23:19 - 23:24)
see them because actors who play (23:22 - 23:26)
different roles can change their (23:24 - 23:27)
physicality and they actually do change (23:26 - 23:30)
how they act and how they act out and (23:27 - 23:32)
that doesn't come across as clearly in (23:30 - 23:33)
voice animation especially when you have (23:32 - 23:35)
a lot of people a lot of famous actors (23:33 - 23:36)
are like oh I'm not going to really do (23:35 - 23:38)
anything for this role I'm just going to (23:36 - 23:40)
say the lines (23:38 - 23:42)
um which is a super frustrating thing (23:40 - 23:44)
like (23:42 - 23:46)
if you if you ever watched Archer and (23:44 - 23:48)
Bob's Burger you know that they're the (23:46 - 23:49)
same I always said but that's what I (23:48 - 23:52)
love about it but you can actually tell (23:49 - 23:57)
that he changes how he speaks between (23:52 - 24:00)
the two characters like he does do a lot (23:57 - 24:02)
of Voice work to make the two characters (24:00 - 24:05)
distinct although he doesn't have the (24:02 - 24:06)
ability to get out of his own voice (24:05 - 24:09)
right because Bob Bob sounds depressed (24:06 - 24:11)
and Archer sounds confident right and so (24:09 - 24:14)
they do a lot of that stuff whereas it's (24:11 - 24:16)
harder for me to say I can hear a lot of (24:14 - 24:19)
differences between Chris Pratt in The (24:16 - 24:21)
Lego Movie and Chris Pratt in the Mario (24:19 - 24:25)
movie like he just really doesn't (24:21 - 24:27)
do a lot and they don't really hire him (24:25 - 24:29)
to do a wide variety of characters that (24:27 - 24:32)
give a lot of depth and it it's a it's a (24:29 - 24:34)
whole frustrating thing anyways join me (24:32 - 24:37)
on my voice actors hatred podcast that (24:34 - 24:40)
there was a Lego Movie and I forgot I (24:37 - 24:43)
saw it there's two isn't there two yeah (24:40 - 24:45)
there's at least two I think I liked it (24:43 - 24:46)
I think it was all right the first (24:45 - 24:47)
thought the first Lego movie was super (24:46 - 24:49)
fun I don't remember enjoying this (24:47 - 24:50)
doesn't he show up at the end of that (24:49 - 24:53)
movie like a detective Pikachu (24:50 - 24:56)
isn't the the spoiler for that movie is (24:53 - 24:57)
like (24:56 - 24:59)
he's like standing there at the end with (24:57 - 25:03)
his kid building Legos no I mean they're (24:59 - 25:05)
one of the voice actors is standing (25:03 - 25:06)
there with his kid and it's a whole (25:05 - 25:08)
thing but oh (25:06 - 25:12)
yeah I don't remember that movie (25:08 - 25:12)
I remember being okay though (25:14 - 25:19)
um (25:17 - 25:21)
all right well uh before we get to this (25:19 - 25:22)
Scarlet Violet stuff let's take a quick (25:21 - 25:24)
break uh when we come back we got (25:22 - 25:27)
scarlet and violet trailer uh and uh (25:24 - 25:29)
yeah we'll go from there we will be (25:27 - 25:30)
right back (25:29 - 25:34)
and we are back from our break okay so (25:30 - 25:37)
uh the Nintendo Direct opened up with a (25:34 - 25:40)
Pokemon trailer we got new footage (25:37 - 25:43)
it wasn't the most exciting footage it (25:40 - 25:44)
was not (25:43 - 25:49)
it was new it was at least true uh okay (25:44 - 25:52)
so in uh this off the press release (25:49 - 25:54)
explore (25:52 - 25:58)
Mossy Town Missouri yeah or Missouri (25:54 - 26:02)

Carlos we are going all the way down to (26:02 - 26:07)
Missouri (26:05 - 26:09)

the Japanese U and the Japanese e masui (26:09 - 26:13)
masui (26:12 - 26:16)
that's why I hate myself (26:13 - 26:20)
um that invests we will (26:16 - 26:23)
Japanese knowledge invest that's yet to (26:20 - 26:25)
wear a vest on the show we need to get (26:23 - 26:28)
our best quota (26:25 - 26:32)
uh so we're going to this uh New Town in (26:28 - 26:35)
the land of uh kitakami uh the community (26:32 - 26:40)
center in the middle of Missouri (26:35 - 26:40)
where locals can get together and chat (26:47 - 26:51)
but it will also serve as the player's (26:50 - 26:53)
base of operations for the duration of (26:51 - 26:55)
the school trip there's a shop nearby (26:53 - 26:57)
with toys and magazines on display and (26:55 - 26:59)
outside the town you'll be treated to a (26:57 - 27:02)
view of picturesque fields and rice (26:59 - 27:04)
paddies spoiler alert you are not going (27:02 - 27:06)
to be able to walk into the shop I (27:04 - 27:09)
guarantee it was just gonna be a menu (27:06 - 27:12)
buildings (27:09 - 27:12)
foreign (27:19 - 27:25)
Violet does not have that functionality (27:21 - 27:25)
um investigate four you unique biomes in (27:25 - 27:31)
the hidden treasure part two blueberry (27:29 - 27:33)
Academy is where players will go to (27:31 - 27:35)
study abroad (27:33 - 27:35)
um (27:35 - 27:38)
in the Indigo disc it's home to a (27:35 - 27:40)
facility called the terrarium dome which (27:38 - 27:42)
maintains a variety of ecosystems that (27:40 - 27:44)
provide a livable environment for (27:42 - 27:47)
Pokemon this world renowned Park Beneath (27:44 - 27:49)
the Sea is constructed to bolster the (27:47 - 27:51)
learning environment for strong trainers (27:49 - 27:52)
the terrarian Dome is made up of four (27:51 - 27:54)
areas (27:52 - 27:56)
Each of which features a unique climate (27:54 - 27:59)
and ecosystem I like how they respelled (27:56 - 28:02)
terrarium so that it's Terra yeah (27:59 - 28:05)
but every time I'm looking at it it just (28:02 - 28:07)
bothers me I'm like it's not okay wait (28:05 - 28:10)
they're saying terrarium which is (28:07 - 28:13)
impossible to say (28:10 - 28:15)
the artificial Sky projected under the (28:13 - 28:17)
ceiling and walls will change to reflect (28:15 - 28:19)
the time of day (28:17 - 28:21)
um and the weather the temperature is (28:19 - 28:24)
unique and carefully regulated the (28:21 - 28:25)
trainers will find a completely (28:24 - 28:27)
different Pokemon in each area okay (28:25 - 28:30)
we'll stop there (28:27 - 28:30)
who the (28:31 - 28:36)
when okay here's the thing that I I feel (28:33 - 28:38)
like I need to remind myself all the (28:36 - 28:39)
time (28:38 - 28:41)
do you know when we see like trailers to (28:39 - 28:45)
like Legends Arceus or sword and shield (28:41 - 28:48)
and then we tell ourselves (28:45 - 28:50)
this is early footage it'll eventually (28:48 - 28:53)
look better and there is like (28:50 - 28:55)
comparisons of like oh yeah it looks (28:53 - 28:56)
better like this area has like three (28:55 - 28:58)
more whoopers now and like more grass (28:56 - 29:01)
and here's the side by side (28:58 - 29:03)
but then like (29:01 - 29:06)
play like Legends Arceus and go back (29:03 - 29:07)
immediately after you're done playing (29:06 - 29:09)
and watch the trailers there was they (29:07 - 29:12)
were not lying about anything the what (29:09 - 29:14)
they what they showed in that trailer (29:12 - 29:15)
was like oh (29:14 - 29:19)
yeah that that was that was it like you (29:15 - 29:22)
you showed your hand (29:19 - 29:24)
and so when they showed this I couldn't (29:22 - 29:26)
help but think like (29:24 - 29:31)
oh okay oh you know I was all right okay (29:26 - 29:33)
I mean it looks like the rest of the (29:31 - 29:34)
game (29:33 - 29:37)
it does yeah it I and maybe that's my (29:34 - 29:41)
fault for wanting more more yeah it (29:37 - 29:42)
looks like the rest of the game I was (29:41 - 29:45)
expecting masuri to look a little bit (29:42 - 29:48)
more Japanese like the buildings look (29:45 - 29:50)
Japanese and they're rice paddies but (29:48 - 29:53)
the world the the natural features all (29:50 - 29:55)
just look like the rest of paldea yeah (29:53 - 29:56)
yeah (29:55 - 29:58)
for yeah I think that I think maybe (29:56 - 29:59)
that's my complaint I didn't know how to (29:58 - 30:01)
put that into words and I think you did (29:59 - 30:03)
it perfectly Hannah where it's like (30:01 - 30:06)
when they went to go show the first DLC (30:03 - 30:09)
I expected like a Japanese Forest almost (30:06 - 30:11)
and maybe that does exist but I was like (30:09 - 30:15)
oh this just looks like paldaya yeah I (30:11 - 30:17)
mean the festival looks plenty Japanese (30:15 - 30:18)
because they were able to make all of (30:17 - 30:20)
the new (30:18 - 30:22)
um buildings and all of the decorations (30:20 - 30:24)
and all of that but once you get into (30:22 - 30:26)
the wild all of the pictures we've seen (30:24 - 30:27)
all of the (30:26 - 30:30)
screenshots and trailers everything (30:27 - 30:32)
except for the rice paddies just looks (30:30 - 30:37)
like paldea yeah I think (30:32 - 30:37)
I think they wanted to draw the line (30:38 - 30:44)
where it feels like it's in the same (30:42 - 30:46)
world so it doesn't feel like (30:44 - 30:48)
you've gone to like a completely (30:46 - 30:52)
different game but I think they (30:48 - 30:54)
hedge their bets (30:52 - 31:00)
too far and kept it way too close to (30:54 - 31:00)
the thing is if you think about it like (31:06 - 31:10)
there's an entire bamboo forest for no (31:08 - 31:12)
reason in paudia like it's just there (31:10 - 31:16)
that whole area so like even with the (31:12 - 31:20)
existing assets they had enough there to (31:16 - 31:21)
be able to reconfigure them in a way (31:20 - 31:24)
that made it feel much (31:21 - 31:27)
different than the mainland and I I and (31:24 - 31:29)
I I can see like the thought process of (31:27 - 31:30)
going well that's going to feel like (31:29 - 31:34)
it's too incongruent right like you have (31:30 - 31:36)
gone somewhere that just doesn't fit in (31:34 - 31:38)
the in the world because you're going (31:36 - 31:40)
somewhere else right (31:38 - 31:44)
I think they (31:40 - 31:47)
worried about that too much I think they (31:44 - 31:51)
needed to lean into that more based off (31:47 - 31:52)
of what we saw in this trailer because (31:51 - 31:55)
the trailer was like is it a new land is (31:52 - 31:57)
it a new town like (31:55 - 31:59)
I guess the buildings are a little (31:57 - 32:02)
different and there's other Pokemon but (31:59 - 32:05)
other than that that's about it it feels (32:02 - 32:07)
like this could have just been dropped (32:05 - 32:09)
in the middle of paldea and we would (32:07 - 32:11)
have been like oh where'd that down come (32:09 - 32:14)
from yeah (32:11 - 32:14)
the the second DLC I guess we'll jump (32:16 - 32:23)
back and forth looks way better like (32:19 - 32:26)
they they show those characters I think (32:23 - 32:30)
that the biome terrarium thing is a cool (32:26 - 32:32)
concept (32:30 - 32:33)
um I I don't know if it's gonna be like (32:32 - 32:35)
a Super Smash Brothers things where like (32:33 - 32:37)
the terrariums like change I don't even (32:35 - 32:39)
remember that map in Smash where like (32:38 - 32:41)
you're like fighting and then it goes (32:39 - 32:44)
away yeah yeah that would be cool I I (32:41 - 32:47)
mean I I doubt that I kind of hope that (32:44 - 32:51)
they brought back the on some level the (32:47 - 32:53)
old Safari Zone where you could put (32:51 - 32:55)
things in to make your own unique areas (32:53 - 32:56)
of the surf zone which was like one of (32:55 - 32:58)
the only good things in heart gold soul (32:56 - 33:00)
silver and so it'd be interesting if (32:58 - 33:03)
they added that here that you had the (33:00 - 33:06)
ability to swap out amongst the (33:03 - 33:08)
terrarium types to bring in an (33:06 - 33:09)
interesting way to make (33:08 - 33:13)
unique and diverse Pokemon show up I do (33:09 - 33:16)
not have that sense that they did that (33:13 - 33:18)
from the trailer because they did say (33:16 - 33:20)
the only thing that you get that from is (33:18 - 33:23)
maintains a variety of ecosystems but (33:20 - 33:27)
but and they say there's four areas and (33:23 - 33:30)
the trailer shows very specific ones so (33:27 - 33:32)
the only way you would think there might (33:30 - 33:33)
be more is from their press release (33:32 - 33:37)
saying a variety because four isn't much (33:33 - 33:40)
of a variety if four is a variety though (33:37 - 33:43)
I mean I I live in a city that has five (33:40 - 33:47)
quadrants so no six six quadrants now so (33:43 - 33:49)
words mean what they want them to mean (33:47 - 33:51)
yeah (33:49 - 33:53)
I I (33:51 - 33:57)
I'm worried that the biome thing will be (33:53 - 33:59)
super small just like if you look at all (33:57 - 34:01)
the screenshots and the perspective of (33:59 - 34:03)
like going from here to there because (34:01 - 34:05)
like you can see the the grass area from (34:03 - 34:09)
the winter area and you can see this The (34:05 - 34:11)
Rock area from the sand area like the (34:09 - 34:12)
perspective (34:11 - 34:15)
makes it seem like (34:12 - 34:18)
they show that but they show the lines (34:15 - 34:19)
they show you jumping over the lines (34:18 - 34:21)
where you're going from one area to the (34:19 - 34:23)
other I got the whole opposite feeling I (34:21 - 34:24)
felt like this was way bigger than I (34:23 - 34:27)
expected it to be hmm okay (34:24 - 34:28)
yeah I felt like it looked a little (34:27 - 34:31)
small I wonder if the biome stuff (34:28 - 34:33)
um (34:31 - 34:35)
my first thought was like because they (34:33 - 34:37)
show alolan executor (34:35 - 34:39)
I was like I wonder if the biomes are (34:37 - 34:41)
like areas where you can do the regional (34:39 - 34:43)
Evolutions (34:41 - 34:46)
here you can see alola if you stand here (34:43 - 34:47)
you can do Galler (34:46 - 34:50)
this did exist in Sun and Moon by the (34:47 - 34:51)
way I don't know if people know this but (34:50 - 34:53)
in Ultra Sun Ultra Moon If you flew into (34:51 - 34:56)
an ultra Wormhole you could evolve like (34:53 - 34:59)
execute into a regular exeggutor because (34:56 - 35:02)
you weren't technically in alola anymore (34:59 - 35:05)
and I don't know if (35:02 - 35:09)
anywhere in Galler had that (35:05 - 35:09)
no not that I can recall not that I (35:10 - 35:16)
remember at all no but yeah in alola you (35:13 - 35:18)
could I mean yeah that was also the (35:16 - 35:21)
first game so there wasn't there (35:18 - 35:21)
you also needed to have the ultra (35:22 - 35:28)
version of those games yeah but (35:24 - 35:28)
um I yeah I I I think both (35:28 - 35:33)
looked fine but neither (35:33 - 35:38)
area was like I'm super excited for this (35:39 - 35:47)
but then again I felt that way for Crown (35:42 - 35:49)
Tundra and I love armor when they showed (35:47 - 35:51)
them where I was just like okay (35:49 - 35:53)
I mean it wasn't until actually moving (35:51 - 35:55)
through them that I understood what they (35:53 - 35:57)
were going for better (35:55 - 36:00)
um so it's really hard for me to make an (35:57 - 36:04)
actual judgment call on (36:00 - 36:08)
how fun I think they're going to be like (36:04 - 36:10)
I was having this conversation with (36:08 - 36:11)
somebody else where I was like if you (36:10 - 36:13)
already are against scarlet and violet (36:11 - 36:16)
and that game is dead to you I don't (36:13 - 36:17)
think there was anything in these (36:16 - 36:20)
trailers to change your mind I think (36:17 - 36:22)
they still looked a lot like scarlet and (36:20 - 36:24)
violet and if you didn't like it these (36:22 - 36:26)
DLCs (36:24 - 36:28)
aren't necessarily going to convince you (36:26 - 36:30)
to like (36:28 - 36:33)
the dlc's added a lot to sword and (36:30 - 36:36)
shield but uh arguably didn't radically (36:33 - 36:38)
alter those games so if he didn't like (36:36 - 36:40)
them they weren't going to suddenly do (36:38 - 36:42)
something that made you Overjoyed with (36:40 - 36:44)
them but they added a lot to make the (36:42 - 36:46)
games better and I think that same thing (36:44 - 36:49)
is going to happen here I don't think if (36:46 - 36:50)
you hate scarlet and violet these two (36:49 - 36:52)
DLCs are gonna suddenly make you love (36:50 - 36:55)
the game we'll see how big the battle (36:52 - 36:57)
features are in the second DLC I feel (36:55 - 36:59)
like that may be of interest to some (36:57 - 37:01)
people who have kind of been turned off (36:59 - 37:04)
by scarlet and violet but also just yeah (37:01 - 37:06)
harkenbach 2 sword and shield (37:04 - 37:10)
sword and shields uh DLC did feel (37:06 - 37:12)
different The Vibes were different (37:10 - 37:14)
between the two DLCs and the main game (37:12 - 37:17)
these both just feel like more paldea (37:14 - 37:20)
yeah uh the DLC and sword and shield had (37:17 - 37:21)
walking Pokemon that's what every (37:20 - 37:23)
Pokemon fan on Twitter wanted they want (37:21 - 37:26)
Pokemon to follow you uh that's why it (37:23 - 37:29)
sold so well come on basic basic basic (37:26 - 37:34)
tutorials uh again like I think (37:29 - 37:34)
you know I was hoping for something to (37:35 - 37:41)
be revealed like the Dynamax Adventures (37:38 - 37:42)
like that (37:41 - 37:44)
they're not far enough yet we're not (37:42 - 37:46)
close enough for that yet type of thing (37:44 - 37:48)
at least hinted to in here and it's it's (37:46 - 37:50)
not no this is just showing gameplay (37:48 - 37:52)
this is just showing what it's look this (37:50 - 37:54)
is just a showcase so I I think there (37:52 - 37:56)
may still be more to come that might get (37:54 - 37:59)
people more excited but overall it was (37:56 - 38:01)
just uh oh okay (37:59 - 38:03)
I agree with what you said Greg about (38:01 - 38:05)
how like I don't think this DLC is (38:03 - 38:08)
convincing anyone (38:05 - 38:10)
um that maybe already dislikes scarlet (38:08 - 38:11)
and violet although they did sell a lot (38:10 - 38:13)
of copies of this girl and file it it (38:11 - 38:15)
did it's true (38:13 - 38:17)
but I do remember with the with the (38:15 - 38:19)
sword and shield DLC which I will say I (38:17 - 38:20)
think those trailers made me way more (38:19 - 38:23)
excited than this trailer uh the thing (38:20 - 38:26)
that I I frequently heard was especially (38:23 - 38:28)
with the crown sorry especially with the (38:26 - 38:30)
Isle of armor was this is what the wild (38:28 - 38:33)
area should have been the first time and (38:30 - 38:36)
that did stand out to people of like (38:33 - 38:39)
just being in the Isle of armor felt (38:36 - 38:41)
like (38:39 - 38:43)
what if that middle chunk of sword and (38:41 - 38:46)
shield was this yeah and I think they (38:43 - 38:48)
did that right and I don't think like (38:46 - 38:49)
like (38:48 - 38:52)
it took him a year to ever took him what (38:49 - 38:53)
eight months to get to that point but (38:52 - 38:54)
like (38:53 - 38:56)
that I guess that's like the the the (38:54 - 38:58)
minor (38:56 - 39:00)
ounce of hope I have here is like (38:58 - 39:02)
whatever they they're showing is like (39:00 - 39:03)
yeah this looks like more probably uh (39:02 - 39:06)
but like hopefully something's right (39:03 - 39:10)
yeah I mean I have hope because Isle of (39:06 - 39:13)
armor did ultimately feel like a better (39:10 - 39:15)
version of it (39:13 - 39:17)
um and we did not get that sense from (39:15 - 39:19)
the trailer and so I think it is (39:17 - 39:22)
possible from what they're showing us (39:19 - 39:25)
that we aren't seeing (39:22 - 39:27)
the same sort of Isle of armor area (39:25 - 39:30)
change so it's like it's hard to really (39:27 - 39:31)
make (39:30 - 39:34)
a judgment call which I mean some people (39:31 - 39:36)
could argue for a Taylor trailer then (39:34 - 39:39)
you sort of not met the goal (39:36 - 39:40)
um (39:39 - 39:43)
I I don't know I'm hoping that we will (39:40 - 39:46)
at least get another more expanded one (39:43 - 39:48)
closer to the actual release I think (39:46 - 39:51)
it's somewhat clear given the general (39:48 - 39:53)
Vibe of the trailer that I think the (39:51 - 39:54)
first DLC was supposed to come out (39:53 - 39:57)
during the summer oh yeah oh yeah and (39:54 - 40:01)
it's not like this is a Summer Festival (39:57 - 40:03)
this is a Japanese Summer Festival (40:01 - 40:05)
there's no way this was intended for any (40:03 - 40:08)
other season so it's interesting given (40:05 - 40:11)
that in the light of our arguments of (40:08 - 40:12)
they should delay things they should (40:11 - 40:13)
delay things I think it's pretty clear (40:12 - 40:15)
that they are delaying the release of (40:13 - 40:17)
this DLC oh yeah 100 (40:15 - 40:21)
and I I'm wondering (40:17 - 40:23)
like my speculation was is that they (40:21 - 40:25)
wanted to put out in the summer but they (40:23 - 40:26)
realized that they really had to fix a (40:25 - 40:29)
lot of things (40:26 - 40:31)
in the base game before they could do (40:29 - 40:33)
this and I think the continuing problems (40:31 - 40:35)
are having with raids are symptoms of (40:33 - 40:37)
them trying to fix things which is why (40:35 - 40:40)
this was clearly delayed from Summer (40:37 - 40:42)
into fall (40:40 - 40:46)
and I'm wondering if (40:42 - 40:48)
based on that we are going to see some (40:46 - 40:50)
more improvements in the games when the (40:48 - 40:53)
DLCs actually hit or if it's really (40:50 - 40:55)
they're trying to get the game into a (40:53 - 40:58)
much better state to make transition (40:55 - 41:02)
into the DLC seem more Flawless and (40:58 - 41:03)
connected (41:02 - 41:05)
um (41:03 - 41:09)
we will get to raids breaking again yeah (41:05 - 41:11)
yeah we'll get there but what we're (41:09 - 41:13)
gonna say Hannah I am really curious how (41:11 - 41:15)
much of these new DLCs are going to (41:13 - 41:18)
focus on features versus story yeah (41:15 - 41:19)
because I feel like these ones are (41:18 - 41:22)
focusing more on story than sword and (41:19 - 41:23)
shields were this is more of an (41:22 - 41:25)
extension of the story than we got in (41:23 - 41:27)
the previous DLCs and so I'm not sure (41:25 - 41:29)
whether they are focusing more on that (41:27 - 41:31)
and making it less of a focus on new (41:29 - 41:32)
features (41:31 - 41:34)
or whether we're still going to get new (41:32 - 41:36)
features that they just haven't shown (41:34 - 41:38)
yet because these are really early on (41:36 - 41:40)
trailers (41:38 - 41:42)
yeah I think this is also like a symptom (41:40 - 41:44)
my uh (41:42 - 41:47)
like people having just huge (41:44 - 41:48)
expectations for Pokemon and then being (41:47 - 41:51)
let down I like yeah and I fell into (41:48 - 41:53)
this with ultrasound Ultra Moon I don't (41:51 - 41:54)
know if you guys remember but like when (41:53 - 41:56)
they showed like the updated map to (41:54 - 41:58)
Ultrasound Ultra moon like the the (41:56 - 41:59)
screenshot people were like these look (41:58 - 42:01)
like gyms like remember in Sun and Moon (41:59 - 42:03)
there was a bunch of construction sites (42:01 - 42:04)
they're actually going to get turned (42:03 - 42:05)
into buildings in Ultra Sun Ultra moon (42:04 - 42:08)
like none of that happened like the only (42:05 - 42:10)
buildings Ultra Sun Ultra Moon added (42:08 - 42:13)
were like these bad photo booth things (42:10 - 42:15)
and I don't remember what they did like (42:13 - 42:17)
there were no gyms like there was (42:15 - 42:20)
nothing like super wild or twisty about (42:17 - 42:23)
that kind of stuff which is like (42:20 - 42:24)
that doesn't mean Ultra sun and Ultraman (42:23 - 42:26)
are bad games I think they I think they (42:24 - 42:28)
were well worth the 40 but (42:26 - 42:29)
um (42:28 - 42:33)
I I even even with like Legends Arceus (42:29 - 42:34)
people are like I can't wait for the DLC (42:33 - 42:37)
like we found like the a player's house (42:34 - 42:39)
and like maybe this was like none of (42:37 - 42:40)
that happened (42:39 - 42:43)
so I don't I don't want to be like oh my (42:40 - 42:46)
gosh these DLCs are gonna really pump (42:43 - 42:48)
this game up to the next level because (42:46 - 42:50)
I think the thing that could pump this (42:48 - 42:52)
game up to the next level is just like (42:50 - 42:55)
fixing the frame rate fixing the raids (42:52 - 42:56)
like (42:55 - 42:59)
just making what we are playing now a (42:56 - 43:01)
more (42:59 - 43:02)
there's like fixing the quality of life (43:01 - 43:04)
of what we have right now is like is (43:02 - 43:07)
like what what I would prefer over (43:04 - 43:13)
more slightly broken stuff like yeah (43:07 - 43:17)
like I I literally had it I I did what (43:13 - 43:20)
30 gimme ghoul raids and all of a sudden (43:17 - 43:23)
my like little icons on my map are in (43:20 - 43:24)
the center of my screen just like (43:23 - 43:26)
floating around and I was like Oh I (43:24 - 43:27)
thought I thought we fixed this issue (43:26 - 43:30)
like I haven't I haven't seen this issue (43:27 - 43:31)
in two months and now I have to hard (43:30 - 43:35)
reboot my game because just I just came (43:31 - 43:36)
out of a rate I've been standing in the (43:35 - 43:38)
same spot just connecting to raids over (43:36 - 43:39)
and over and I come out and all of a (43:38 - 43:42)
sudden like my North indicator is above (43:39 - 43:45)
my character's head and then like like (43:42 - 43:49)
these games are still broken yeah (43:45 - 43:51)
um (43:49 - 43:51)
what else did they have in this press (43:53 - 43:56)
release uh oh I will mention they should (43:54 - 44:00)
they for a spoiler if you played through (43:56 - 44:01)
scarlet and violet there was not a (44:00 - 44:05)
single double battle in the entire game (44:01 - 44:09)
this trailer shows a double battle (44:05 - 44:09)
so uh there you go that's cool but it's (44:11 - 44:16)
in the second DLC so it's gonna be a (44:14 - 44:19)
while till we get there yeah uh new (44:16 - 44:21)
characters are revealed (44:19 - 44:24)
among them are are (44:21 - 44:26)
crying now (44:24 - 44:30)
is it cyrino okay (44:26 - 44:33)
it's close to crypto uh founder of the (44:30 - 44:35)
director and Academy and Lacey as a (44:33 - 44:37)
student there she's the only student in (44:35 - 44:38)
the entire school (44:37 - 44:40)
um having heard rumors about players and (44:38 - 44:45)
their Adventure uh Cyrano visits paldaya (44:40 - 44:47)
to invite them to an institution as an (44:45 - 44:50)
exchange student it seems that they're a (44:47 - 44:51)
long time acquaintance of director (44:50 - 44:54)
clavel Lacey is a second year student at (44:51 - 44:55)
the blueberry Academy and she's a (44:54 - 44:57)
reliable person who shows the player (44:55 - 44:59)
around the academy when first arriving (44:57 - 45:01)
her Pokemon battles battling skills are (44:59 - 45:04)
apparently nothing to scoff at (45:01 - 45:07)
all right this needs to be said (45:04 - 45:11)
just because he has a hone Edge scarf (45:07 - 45:13)
does not mean there is a new version of (45:11 - 45:15)
Honedge coming (45:13 - 45:18)
they pulled this with what's her name in (45:15 - 45:21)
The Toxic butterfly in her hair (45:18 - 45:25)
they've it is just a style Choice what (45:21 - 45:27)
about his scarf is honage the end of it (45:25 - 45:30)
the end of it oh I maybe I have a bad (45:27 - 45:33)
picture of him (45:30 - 45:36)
no you're on the same website (45:33 - 45:38)
I I guess I don't see it (45:36 - 45:41)
the swirl the swirl the blue Swirl at (45:38 - 45:43)
the end of the scarf (45:41 - 45:45)
loose am I looking at the right picture (45:43 - 45:48)
are we looking at the old guy yeah what (45:45 - 45:53)
swirl what are you looking at (45:48 - 45:53)
he has like a Pokeball on the middle of (45:55 - 46:00)
his scarf right or is it high and then (45:57 - 46:02)
around his neck (46:00 - 46:04)
under the lapels is a long black scarf (46:02 - 46:07)
and a it is a hone Edge scarf I don't (46:04 - 46:08)
see the bottom of a scarf though it gets (46:07 - 46:10)
cut off by the image oh you go to the (46:08 - 46:12)
Pokemon website and go to the DLC (46:10 - 46:13)
characters (46:12 - 46:15)
oh okay okay sorry I was on the press (46:13 - 46:17)
release website my bad (46:15 - 46:21)
got it my bad (46:17 - 46:21)
um (46:22 - 46:26)
yeah and then they don't talk about the (46:23 - 46:27)
other two characters with the weird hair (46:26 - 46:30)
yeah they showed off a couple more (46:27 - 46:34)
characters but oh I see I see I see (46:30 - 46:37)
I was looking at his in-game model yeah (46:34 - 46:38)
yeah I know the picture right below it I (46:37 - 46:41)
was like yeah (46:38 - 46:41)
I mean she also has (46:41 - 46:46)
I I can't place which one (46:43 - 46:48)
right now people were saying about what (46:46 - 46:50)
Lacey was showing off but again these (46:48 - 46:52)
are just style choices (46:50 - 46:54)
yeah they are cool ways that Pokemon (46:52 - 46:56)
designs are integrated into the fashion (46:54 - 46:58)
and the Pokemon characters in ways that (46:56 - 46:59)
we can't get in Pokemon Center clothing (46:58 - 47:02)
apparently correct you're telling me (46:59 - 47:05)
that iono didn't have a Magnemite on her (47:02 - 47:07)
team yeah no she even though she had (47:05 - 47:09)
Magnemite in her hair but she has them (47:07 - 47:10)
in her hair but they're her precious (47:09 - 47:12)
children so she doesn't send them into (47:10 - 47:15)
battle got it that makes sense (47:12 - 47:15)
yeah they don't talk about the people in (47:16 - 47:22)
the trailer with the (47:19 - 47:22)
not at all they're not even on the (47:22 - 47:27)
character list in the website I'm like (47:24 - 47:29)
they have they're missing people they (47:27 - 47:32)
say their name in the trailer they don't (47:29 - 47:35)
they don't have them here introducing (47:32 - 47:37)
some of the characters only two of which (47:35 - 47:39)
we feel are important Cyrano and Lacey (47:37 - 47:43)
[Laughter] (47:39 - 47:43)
also like what do we battle why are we (47:43 - 47:48)
battling people I this is the same issue (47:46 - 47:50)
with like the crown Tundra and the Isle (47:48 - 47:52)
of armor like we're all level 100 like (47:50 - 47:55)
are these NPCs gonna be level 102 are (47:52 - 47:57)
they gonna take away our Pro battles (47:55 - 47:58)
they're they're trying to finally (47:57 - 48:00)
introduce double battles into the game (47:58 - 48:03)
finally after all these years double (48:00 - 48:05)
battles are finally a thing it doesn't (48:03 - 48:07)
work the blueberry Academy focuses on (48:05 - 48:10)
battling that's I think Ben said yeah I (48:07 - 48:13)
mean there there was (48:10 - 48:15)
technically level scaling technique well (48:13 - 48:17)
actually there were there was (48:15 - 48:18)
technically level scaling in scarlet and (48:17 - 48:21)
violet if you had if you had less than (48:18 - 48:25)
eight gym matches what was it it was it (48:21 - 48:27)
was like if you didn't beat Leon (48:25 - 48:28)
everyone in the crown Tundra and the (48:27 - 48:30)
Isle of armor was like level like 25 (48:28 - 48:33)
yeah and then if you did beat Leon (48:30 - 48:37)
everyone was like what like level 65 (48:33 - 48:40)
I think it was 65 60 or 65 yeah (48:37 - 48:42)
um which is like a form of level scaling (48:40 - 48:44)
sure because like you know if you have (48:42 - 48:45)
three Gym badges you could go over to (48:44 - 48:47)
the crown Tundra you could still have a (48:45 - 48:51)
great time like that's cool uh (48:47 - 48:51)
I don't know how you fix that problem (48:51 - 48:56)
because you also don't want to like tell (48:54 - 48:58)
your players like oh you need like a (48:56 - 49:00)
team of at least 70 to go over here like (48:58 - 49:02)
that's not fun for somebody who just (49:00 - 49:04)
bought a DLC to be like oh I can't even (49:02 - 49:06)
do that like all my friends are doing (49:04 - 49:08)
that and I can't go there (49:06 - 49:11)
just Co-op work over here these games (49:08 - 49:14)
have co-op by the way I know like four (49:11 - 49:17)
people tried it (49:14 - 49:20)
the co-op is fun I will stand by that I (49:17 - 49:21)
enjoy it (49:20 - 49:23)
I look (49:21 - 49:26)
it's week after week we come on and we (49:23 - 49:28)
talk about how these games are buggy and (49:26 - 49:30)
like they don't work and they crash and (49:28 - 49:32)
like we literally just got our new Raid (49:30 - 49:33)
event and it was broken for like seven (49:32 - 49:37)
hours before they fixed it all of that (49:33 - 49:39)
is true but it's also true that these (49:37 - 49:41)
games were still incredibly ambitious (49:39 - 49:43)
like this is still their first big open (49:41 - 49:45)
world game like I feel like people don't (49:43 - 49:47)
talk about this is the first game they (49:45 - 49:49)
also did Co-op which happened to be an (49:47 - 49:52)
open world game as well like this is the (49:49 - 49:54)
first game they've done Co-op to this (49:52 - 49:55)
extent (49:54 - 49:57)
black and white had some (49:55 - 49:59)
yeah but in black and white you couldn't (49:57 - 50:01)
like start the game with a person and (49:59 - 50:02)
walk through the entire game with them (50:01 - 50:05)
yeah like this Co-op is I legitimately I (50:02 - 50:07)
suppose the co-op that most people would (50:05 - 50:08)
think Co-op is which is like let's play (50:07 - 50:10)
the whole game together (50:08 - 50:12)
um there's a lot going on in this game (50:10 - 50:14)
it's they're very ambitious but at the (50:12 - 50:17)
same time they're very broken and (50:14 - 50:19)
bad frame rate and a little ugly not the (50:17 - 50:21)
prettiest Pokemon games ever made but (50:19 - 50:25)
I I still want them to be good like I (50:21 - 50:28)
think there is (50:25 - 50:28)
there is something in gaming I don't (50:28 - 50:34)
know what it's called I'll use I'll use (50:32 - 50:36)
two examples there are two games we talk (50:34 - 50:38)
about all the time we'll bring up the (50:36 - 50:41)
first game final fantasy 14. that game (50:38 - 50:45)
was so bad when it came out that they (50:41 - 50:47)
literally just they had an event in the (50:45 - 50:50)
game to destroy the entire world and (50:47 - 50:52)
then they took like a year and a half (50:50 - 50:55)
off and then they relaunched it and now (50:52 - 50:57)
it is this game that people absolutely (50:55 - 51:00)
adore and love like they literally (50:57 - 51:03)
launched the worst game ever (51:00 - 51:06)
they admitted it was bad and then they (51:03 - 51:08)
they relaunched it another series I've (51:06 - 51:09)
done this you've never heard this game (51:08 - 51:13)
before in this podcast was Destiny the (51:09 - 51:16)
first Destiny got very mediocre reviews (51:13 - 51:17)
like a lot of six out of tens a seven (51:16 - 51:20)
out of tens every single review was like (51:17 - 51:22)
there's something special here this game (51:20 - 51:26)
is just not good right and when they (51:22 - 51:28)
released the taking King which came a (51:26 - 51:31)
year later every single review was like (51:28 - 51:33)
you need to buy Destiny now now is the (51:31 - 51:35)
time to play they fixed everything we've (51:33 - 51:37)
been complaining about for the year like (51:35 - 51:39)
Destiny is good again now you know that (51:37 - 51:41)
Destiny has had some bad expansions (51:39 - 51:43)
since but like games have done this I (51:41 - 51:45)
think another game that has done this (51:43 - 51:48)
was um the Rainbow Six Siege game I (51:45 - 51:49)
think it launched like really really (51:48 - 51:51)
poorly and now it's like this like super (51:49 - 51:53)
loved competitive game (51:51 - 51:55)
um it's the new Rainbow I can't remember (51:53 - 51:58)
the actual actual name but rainbow Siege (51:55 - 52:01)
and I want that for Pokemon I want that (51:58 - 52:04)
so bad for Pokemon I want like the the (52:01 - 52:06)
DLC to come out and for everyone to be (52:04 - 52:09)
like they they did it they fixed (52:06 - 52:11)
everything for scarlet and violet this (52:09 - 52:12)
is the time to come back if you (52:11 - 52:15)
purchased it this upgrade is a a million (52:12 - 52:17)
percent worth it like if you if you (52:15 - 52:18)
haven't tried a Pokemon game in the last (52:17 - 52:21)
five years now is the time to jump on I (52:18 - 52:23)
want that so bad because I've seen so (52:21 - 52:25)
many I've listed three games but there's (52:23 - 52:27)
a ton of games that have done this so (52:25 - 52:29)
that have made this like Miracle uh (52:27 - 52:32)
another one uh no man's Sky I bought no (52:29 - 52:35)
man's Sky I regretted that purchase it (52:32 - 52:37)
wasn't even like two hours into that (52:35 - 52:40)
game and I was like oh I just burned (52:37 - 52:43)
sixty dollars so badly I wish I could (52:40 - 52:46)
return this it was awful and now like no (52:43 - 52:48)
man's sky is like this super loved game (52:46 - 52:50)
and every time somebody brings up no (52:48 - 52:52)
man's Sky the thing you hear is like oh (52:50 - 52:53)
they really (52:52 - 52:56)
it's it's a good which is like Fair like (52:53 - 52:57)
that's a good that's a thing you want to (52:56 - 52:59)
hear is like people being like nah they (52:57 - 53:01)
fixed it man it's really good I want to (52:59 - 53:03)
be able to say that for Pokemon I don't (53:01 - 53:05)
want to fall through the floor anymore (53:03 - 53:07)
and it's a difference there that Pokemon (53:05 - 53:10)
has the expectation of a different game (53:07 - 53:13)
coming out sooner than those games would (53:10 - 53:15)
like the next game in the main Series (53:13 - 53:18)
yeah because I don't think I mean I know (53:15 - 53:20)
Final Fantasy has a lot of games but I (53:18 - 53:21)
don't think that they happen as (53:20 - 53:22)
frequently (53:21 - 53:25)
no no Final Fantasy games take a while (53:22 - 53:26)
to come out (53:25 - 53:27)
uh I mean it's different when you're (53:26 - 53:29)
talking about the MMO because they do (53:27 - 53:31)
have to pump out uh an expansion to the (53:29 - 53:34)
base game about every year and a half or (53:31 - 53:37)
their base will fall off but that being (53:34 - 53:39)
says like (53:37 - 53:42)
and I talked to this with people before (53:39 - 53:45)
each expansion they come out with they (53:42 - 53:48)
do go back to the base game and say we (53:45 - 53:49)
are now going to fix a bunch of stuff (53:48 - 53:52)
that was bad because the biggest joke in (53:49 - 53:54)
Final Fantasy 14 (53:52 - 53:58)
forever was how bad the grass is (53:54 - 54:01)
because what's familiar the base game (53:58 - 54:05)
they decided to procedurally (54:01 - 54:09)
have the game make grass they weren't (54:05 - 54:11)
going to draw a grass they just broke (54:09 - 54:17)
code to say just make grass and it is so (54:11 - 54:21)
bad and is so ugly and they finally said (54:17 - 54:23)
after (54:21 - 54:27)
10 years we are fixing (54:23 - 54:31)
all the grass fix all the trees (54:27 - 54:34)
we're gonna fix it but like (54:31 - 54:36)
every time they come out with a DLC they (54:34 - 54:38)
have a chance to go back and fix the (54:36 - 54:40)
base game because you have to do things (54:38 - 54:43)
to make it integrate right and they (54:40 - 54:45)
could be doing that here and it is the (54:43 - 54:47)
hope that the DLCs are going to bring (54:45 - 54:49)
overall General and you know (54:47 - 54:51)
improvements because you have to touch (54:49 - 54:53)
the base game you you have to be able to (54:51 - 54:55)
add on the DC you can go back in you're (54:53 - 54:57)
making changes of an area you need to (54:55 - 54:59)
make changes everywhere and you have the (54:57 - 55:00)
chance to do it whether or not they're (54:59 - 55:02)
going to take the chance to do it is (55:00 - 55:04)
another question yeah I don't think I (55:02 - 55:06)
have the hope for that yeah I hope that (55:04 - 55:08)
maybe these things will be fixed in the (55:06 - 55:11)
next main Series game but I mean I had I (55:08 - 55:13)
have the tidiest Hope in the fact that (55:11 - 55:16)
the DLC was clearly delayed (55:13 - 55:18)
um but they lost that hope in all the (55:16 - 55:21)
raids broke (55:18 - 55:21)
and both can be true the game freak has (55:23 - 55:28)
made a ton of bad games and Game Freak (55:26 - 55:30)
has made a ton of good games and they (55:28 - 55:32)
can fix their bad games they've done (55:30 - 55:33)
this before and I will give you an (55:32 - 55:38)
example the worst Pokemon game ever made (55:33 - 55:41)
by game freak is Diamond and Pearl it is (55:38 - 55:45)
so bad it is it is it the pacing is (55:41 - 55:49)
terrible 90 of the trainers use Geodude (55:45 - 55:52)
there's like the the XP bar takes longer (55:49 - 55:54)
than it takes for your for your (55:52 - 55:57)
grandmother to make you a hot cocoa (55:54 - 56:01)
like when you save the the game you feel (55:57 - 56:02)
like you're you're a Game Boy or your (56:01 - 56:05)
your DS whatever that was on your DS is (56:02 - 56:06)
going to explode because it's like (56:05 - 56:08)
saving lots of data please like don't (56:06 - 56:12)
move a millisecond like those games are (56:08 - 56:16)
terrible and then in whatever miracle (56:12 - 56:18)
that happened game freak released one of (56:16 - 56:20)
their best games after that which was (56:18 - 56:21)
Platinum (56:20 - 56:25)
they like they did it they released the (56:21 - 56:27)
worst game they've ever released and (56:25 - 56:29)
then a year and a half later they (56:27 - 56:32)
released one of their best games like so (56:29 - 56:34)
I I do believe (56:32 - 56:36)
that I don't I well I believe that game (56:34 - 56:38)
freak is not the best video game company (56:36 - 56:39)
out there when it comes to making games (56:38 - 56:41)
but they have made good games and they (56:39 - 56:43)
took whatever they hot mess that was (56:41 - 56:45)
Diamond and Pearl and they made platinum (56:43 - 56:47)
and platinum is also like there's no (56:45 - 56:51)
actual reason why if you went into a (56:47 - 56:52)
game store and platinum and diamond and (56:51 - 56:53)
pearl were sitting there and they were (56:52 - 56:55)
both like forty dollars you would ever (56:53 - 56:57)
buy diamond and pearl correct there's no (56:55 - 56:59)
one would ever do like Platinum is the (56:57 - 57:01)
significantly better game in every (56:59 - 57:03)
single aspect (57:01 - 57:04)
um (57:03 - 57:07)
and and that they they did it and so (57:04 - 57:08)
like (57:07 - 57:11)
can can they make this a better game (57:08 - 57:14)
sure yes they've done it before will (57:11 - 57:17)
they don't know don't know like what (57:14 - 57:18)
their time frame is don't know what (57:17 - 57:20)
their budget is don't know if like papa (57:18 - 57:22)
pikachu at the Pokemon company is (57:20 - 57:24)
telling game freak like (57:22 - 57:26)
we don't care move on to the next game (57:24 - 57:28)
after this just pump out this DLC and (57:26 - 57:30)
get get going again like we don't know (57:28 - 57:32)
who's actually like making those harder (57:30 - 57:33)
calls (57:32 - 57:35)
um (57:33 - 57:35)
yeah like we don't know what they're (57:37 - 57:41)
prioritizing we don't know what they see (57:39 - 57:45)
as an actual problem versus what the (57:41 - 57:48)
community feels is the actual problem (57:45 - 57:49)
um (57:48 - 57:52)
and the games are still enjoyable (57:49 - 57:54)
I still like these games I still like (57:52 - 57:55)
them (57:54 - 57:58)
[Laughter] (57:55 - 58:00)
I'm (57:58 - 58:03)
in a rough patch with them I don't I (58:00 - 58:04)
really don't play (58:03 - 58:07)
Scarlet invited all and I recently (58:04 - 58:08)
restarted (58:07 - 58:12)
sword and I'm like man I love these (58:08 - 58:14)
games that's the Pokemon effect though (58:12 - 58:16)
you always hate the current game and (58:14 - 58:18)
then I mean I loved Sergeant when they (58:16 - 58:21)
were there I really like them but going (58:18 - 58:23)
back to them and I'm like this is just (58:21 - 58:26)
so much more of what I've wanted apart (58:23 - 58:28)
from the fact that the roots are just (58:26 - 58:30)
hallways (58:28 - 58:32)
um if you love hallways let me introduce (58:30 - 58:35)
you brilliant Diamond shining curl you (58:32 - 58:37)
can really leaned into the hallways (58:35 - 58:41)
underground hallway system (58:37 - 58:44)
but other than that like all the (58:41 - 58:45)
characters are enjoyable the buildings (58:44 - 58:48)
are like I'm just I'm back in that world (58:45 - 58:50)
and I'm so (58:48 - 58:52)
happy knowing that I'm full well I'm (58:50 - 58:54)
going to be disappointed by the story at (58:52 - 58:55)
the end thankfully I know how the (58:54 - 58:57)
stories end so I'm prepped for how bad (58:55 - 59:01)
it is but that is that is much more of (58:57 - 59:03)
the game that I want and when I go into (59:01 - 59:05)
scarlet and violet and I'm just like (59:03 - 59:08)
I can't with this game like I do the (59:05 - 59:10)
raids when they're special and then that (59:08 - 59:13)
is going to be the extent of me playing (59:10 - 59:15)
these games until the DLCs and I hope (59:13 - 59:18)
the DLCs changed change it but I I don't (59:15 - 59:20)
know that that's (59:18 - 59:23)
a thing well speaking of raids let's (59:20 - 59:25)
take one more break and then we will (59:23 - 59:27)
talk about these gimmigo raids and then (59:25 - 59:28)
just end with a little bit of anime news (59:27 - 59:32)
so we will be right back and we are back (59:28 - 59:33)
from our break (59:32 - 59:36)
announcing a terror Raid Battle event (59:33 - 59:38)
featuring chest form gimme ghoul (59:36 - 59:43)
starting Wednesday June 21st uh what's (59:38 - 59:45)
the end date here July 2nd is the end (59:43 - 59:46)
date (59:45 - 59:48)
um the chest form gimme ghoul appearing (59:46 - 59:50)
in this event will have various Terror (59:48 - 59:51)
types you will be able to find them (59:50 - 59:53)
through one to five star raid battles if (59:51 - 59:55)
you challenge the ones in the five star (59:53 - 59:56)
Raid Battle you'll have a small chance (59:55 - 59:59)
to encounter a shiny chest form gimme (59:56 - 60:00)
ghoul which does not appear during (59:59 - 60:02)
normal gameplay (60:00 - 60:04)
and then there was a new mystery gift (60:02 - 60:07)
code for uh I think it's 10 nuggets 10 (60:04 - 60:09)
rare candy one friend ball (60:07 - 60:11)
that's up on my like Instagram and (60:09 - 60:13)
Twitter and stuff like that (60:11 - 60:15)
uh if you want to redeem those (60:13 - 60:17)
um which I think those end July 31st so (60:15 - 60:19)
you got plenty of time so brand new Raid (60:17 - 60:22)
event this kind of makes sense why uh (60:19 - 60:25)
Dell fox or realaboom didn't show show (60:22 - 60:28)
up yet they could still show up I guess (60:25 - 60:31)
they have done events (60:28 - 60:31)
engineering likes to schedule everything (60:31 - 60:36)
on top of one another so we're seven (60:33 - 60:38)
months into this game this is our first (60:36 - 60:42)
shiny event uh in in sword and shield it (60:38 - 60:43)
took two months to get to our first (60:42 - 60:47)
shiny event which was um The Magikarp uh (60:43 - 60:49)
for for New Years (60:47 - 60:51)
and (60:49 - 60:55)
it broke uh specifically if you were a (60:51 - 60:58)
Scarlet player for some odd reason uh (60:55 - 61:00)
you just couldn't connect or you would (60:58 - 61:02)
disconnect and then if you were a violet (61:00 - 61:04)
player trying to and had a Scarlet (61:02 - 61:06)
player join your game it would break for (61:04 - 61:09)
you now if you happen to get four Violet (61:06 - 61:13)
players together it was issue free (61:09 - 61:13)
um and it took about six to seven hours (61:17 - 61:22)
for them to fix that the raids went up (61:19 - 61:26)
at 10 A.M central time and I was I was (61:22 - 61:27)
streaming on Twitch and I was like oh (61:26 - 61:29)
should I even do these and then it was (61:27 - 61:32)
like oh they're broken okay no I guess (61:29 - 61:34)
I'm ending stream all right I'm taking (61:32 - 61:37)
Wednesday off uh but they got they got (61:34 - 61:40)
fixed you know around five six o'clock (61:37 - 61:42)
um they did like an emergency push (61:40 - 61:45)
update thing (61:42 - 61:45)
how how (61:45 - 61:52)
did how did they what we just came off (61:47 - 61:54)
a month of no when it wasn't a month it (61:52 - 61:57)
was like three weeks I we came off three (61:54 - 61:58)
weeks of (61:57 - 62:01)
no Chestnut and no iron Tusk and great (61:58 - 62:05)
the horns with great stuff (62:01 - 62:07)
whatever their names are (62:05 - 62:09)
I love great hordes that's actually in (62:07 - 62:12)
the DLC hard and iron tusks (62:09 - 62:15)
those are those are the spoiler Pokemon (62:12 - 62:18)
we just got off of those raids they were (62:15 - 62:21)
broken for three weeks it took you three (62:18 - 62:22)
weeks I don't know if it actually took (62:21 - 62:25)
you three weeks but it took two of your (62:22 - 62:26)
audience it took you three weeks to fix (62:25 - 62:29)
these raids and then the next new Raid (62:26 - 62:32)
event is broken yeah in a whole (62:29 - 62:34)
different way (62:32 - 62:34)
they should just give this series over (62:36 - 62:42)
to ilka who knows what they're doing (62:39 - 62:42)
um there it's fixed now uh okay so the (62:46 - 62:51)
other the other news is they they turned (62:49 - 62:53)
gaming gold shiny China that people are (62:51 - 62:57)
very excited you know how's them odds (62:53 - 62:59)
before we get to the odds I will I will (62:57 - 63:00)
say this (62:59 - 63:02)
there (63:00 - 63:04)
I love sword and shield so I will always (63:02 - 63:06)
go to bat for sort of chill don't get me (63:04 - 63:07)
wrong (63:06 - 63:09)
sword and chill people complained that (63:07 - 63:12)
there wasn't enough shiny hunting ways (63:09 - 63:15)
compared to pass games like in X and Y (63:12 - 63:17)
you had radar you had friends so far you (63:15 - 63:19)
had chain fishing (63:17 - 63:21)
um there's probably software setting of (63:19 - 63:22)
course there's probably something else (63:21 - 63:24)
I'm forgetting (63:22 - 63:25)
um (63:24 - 63:29)
I think the concept of returning a (63:25 - 63:32)
Pokemon Shiny for a couple days and you (63:29 - 63:35)
have to do a co-op group thing this (63:32 - 63:40)
weekend is cool and great and it's what (63:35 - 63:41)
I want in a video game and it's kind of (63:40 - 63:43)
why I like raid so much in general from (63:41 - 63:45)
sword and shield to Scarlet violet (63:43 - 63:48)
I just think that's cool it's it's kind (63:45 - 63:49)
of the same like thought of like (63:48 - 63:52)
Community Day like I like going out and (63:49 - 63:54)
being with people and playing Pokemon (63:52 - 63:55)
together (63:54 - 63:57)
uh (63:55 - 63:59)
uh and so the fact that sword and shield (63:57 - 64:02)
did that pretty much once a month every (63:59 - 64:05)
month was like a like yeah they didn't (64:02 - 64:07)
have as many options as shiny hunt like (64:05 - 64:09)
as in sun and moon or X and Y but like (64:07 - 64:11)
that was still a unique way to shiny (64:09 - 64:14)
hunt it was just like (64:11 - 64:18)
on a schedule and required other players (64:14 - 64:20)
I still I thought it was fantastic and (64:18 - 64:24)
so when they're like oh a shiny event (64:20 - 64:24)
the I felt like everyone in the room was (64:25 - 64:30)
like yeah (64:27 - 64:32)
finally and then we were like waiting (64:30 - 64:35)
for the data miners to be like here are (64:32 - 64:36)
the odds (64:35 - 64:38)
maybe it's one in a hundred you know (64:36 - 64:41)
maybe it's like one in 99 because that (64:38 - 64:43)
would be very clever fun because you (64:41 - 64:45)
need 99 you know a big number but you (64:43 - 64:49)
know still kind of it's regular it was (64:45 - 64:51)
one in four thousand it's just (64:49 - 64:55)
what like I they don't they they don't (64:51 - 64:56)
say here they will never say hear what (64:55 - 64:59)
the odds are I want to repeat the what (64:56 - 65:01)
the sentence is if you challenge one in (64:59 - 65:03)
five star Terror Raid Battle you have a (65:01 - 65:06)
small chance to encounter Shine That's (65:03 - 65:08)
not a small that's like they have a (65:06 - 65:11)
small chance of winning the Powerball do (65:08 - 65:13)
you do you have a small chance of (65:11 - 65:16)
winning the Powerball (65:13 - 65:16)
because I know I think our definitions (65:16 - 65:21)
of small are very different Pokemon (65:18 - 65:24)
company (65:21 - 65:26)
even there were raids in scarlet and (65:24 - 65:28)
fire or sword and shield where it was (65:26 - 65:31)
like a 1 in 50 chance or like a one in a (65:28 - 65:33)
hundred chance and you would still spend (65:31 - 65:36)
all weekend doing it and maybe not even (65:33 - 65:37)
get it (65:36 - 65:40)
that's a lot of time to dedicate and (65:37 - 65:41)
like I don't want to get into like uh (65:40 - 65:43)
well that makes the shiny more rare more (65:41 - 65:46)
valuable look look I my LinkedIn is (65:43 - 65:48)
stacked with shinies like I'm getting (65:46 - 65:50)
job offers left and right because (65:48 - 65:53)
employers know how valuable my (65:50 - 65:56)
collection is I'm sure but like (65:53 - 65:58)
there's also something called respecting (65:56 - 66:01)
your players time and like making like (65:58 - 66:04)
even if and and like just having a fun (66:01 - 66:06)
event video games at the end of the day (66:04 - 66:09)
are supposed to be fun (66:06 - 66:11)
there is nothing oh I'm so mad right now (66:09 - 66:14)
there is nothing fun about walking (66:11 - 66:18)
across paudia to a raid event to then (66:14 - 66:21)
realize that it's a three-star raid and (66:18 - 66:23)
that's not shiny and then okay I'll Trek (66:21 - 66:25)
over here okay because I don't know (66:23 - 66:29)
because the map doesn't show me if it's (66:25 - 66:32)
a three or a five or a six or a I have (66:29 - 66:35)
no clue what star rate it is I can only (66:32 - 66:36)
walk (66:35 - 66:38)
and then oh this is a four star this is (66:36 - 66:40)
a four star this is a three star well (66:38 - 66:42)
how do you want your players to do this (66:40 - 66:43)
Pokemon (66:42 - 66:45)
because I have gone seven months in this (66:43 - 66:49)
game without changing my system clock (66:45 - 66:51)
because I'm like there's more than (66:49 - 66:52)
enough to do I don't need I like I can (66:51 - 66:54)
join other people's raids I'm not gonna (66:52 - 66:56)
do all my raids anyways I'm gonna get (66:54 - 66:58)
distracted and I'm gonna like Eevee (66:56 - 67:00)
train I'm gonna I have a million things (66:58 - 67:02)
to do I don't need to change my system (67:00 - 67:03)
clock I don't want to change my system (67:02 - 67:05)
clock because I don't want to be (67:03 - 67:06)
disqualified from the Animal Crossing (67:05 - 67:08)
World Championships that will happen in (67:06 - 67:10)
the future no one wants to be (67:08 - 67:12)
disqualified I'm not a cheater time (67:10 - 67:13)
traveler in that game I can't change my (67:12 - 67:15)
clock but like (67:13 - 67:18)
I walk through all paudia great out of (67:15 - 67:21)
all the promoted raids only one of them (67:18 - 67:23)
was five star the rest was three and (67:21 - 67:24)
four star (67:23 - 67:26)
what do you want me to do do you want me (67:24 - 67:28)
to sit in a 10 minute queue and try to (67:26 - 67:30)
connect to other people for it to say (67:28 - 67:32)
connection not found literally 10 (67:30 - 67:35)
minutes I have footage of this I I like (67:32 - 67:38)
15 plus minutes of me just trying to (67:35 - 67:39)
connect to get into one raid for them (67:38 - 67:41)
the host to be like I didn't like that (67:39 - 67:43)
you're bringing them you disconnect like (67:41 - 67:44)
okay I guess I guess I'll get back in (67:43 - 67:46)
queue like how do you want me to put (67:44 - 67:49)
like the only way I can actually do this (67:46 - 67:51)
is to go into my like system clock and (67:49 - 67:53)
move it like forward a minute and then (67:51 - 67:54)
how all the raids refresh and then I (67:53 - 67:57)
have to do this painful walk to walk to (67:54 - 67:59)
each one like (67:57 - 68:02)
it's not even the shiny odds that are (67:59 - 68:05)
upsetting it's the fact that this event (68:02 - 68:10)
is not fun in like any way like the (68:05 - 68:13)
rewards are okay I guess (68:10 - 68:15)
but like I've been playing it for the (68:13 - 68:17)
rewards if you just play it for the rule (68:15 - 68:20)
for the rewards it's fine no expectation (68:17 - 68:22)
of a shiny (68:20 - 68:25)
but like (68:22 - 68:26)
like (68:25 - 68:29)
you I felt like the rewards were better (68:26 - 68:31)
for great (68:29 - 68:31)
it's so I I think the expectations are (68:32 - 68:37)
different because they they announce (68:35 - 68:40)
this during a press release right like (68:37 - 68:42)
they announced this during the Nintendo (68:40 - 68:43)
Direct they're like this is this is this (68:42 - 68:45)
huge Raid event it's not this weekend (68:43 - 68:48)
it's like two weeks long this is the (68:45 - 68:49)
first time gimme goes in raids it's the (68:48 - 68:51)
first time gimme ghoul can be shiny you (68:49 - 68:53)
can actually get like a decently IV (68:51 - 68:55)
gimme ghoul this is the first time you (68:53 - 68:57)
can get an XXL gimme ghoul or an xxx (68:55 - 68:59)
Smog or XX small give me gold minus (68:57 - 69:03)
Pokemon go like it is on paper an (68:59 - 69:05)
exciting event and then you have this (69:03 - 69:08)
thing where like (69:05 - 69:08)
three and four stars braids are just (69:08 - 69:13)
completely useless like there's no way (69:10 - 69:15)
in the game to regenerate rates I don't (69:13 - 69:17)
know if you guys remember this when I (69:15 - 69:18)
say you guys I'm talking about listeners (69:17 - 69:21)
uh in sword and shield not only could (69:18 - 69:23)
you check like uh (69:21 - 69:25)
I play a lot of Pokemon I understand I'm (69:23 - 69:27)
in the minority but in sword and shield (69:25 - 69:29)
every single day when I would play I (69:27 - 69:32)
would check every single Raiden in the (69:29 - 69:35)
main game the crown Tundra and the Isle (69:32 - 69:36)
of armor I wanted those Watts I was (69:35 - 69:39)
addicted to Watts but I would check them (69:36 - 69:42)
all too and checking every single raid (69:39 - 69:43)
Den in that game took me about 45 (69:42 - 69:46)
minutes that's unreasonable in this game (69:43 - 69:48)
because everything is so spread apart (69:46 - 69:51)
and on top of that in sword and shield I (69:49 - 69:53)
could reset the raid ends manually by (69:51 - 69:56)
just doing them I could if you cleared (69:53 - 69:58)
them out new raids would spawn in (69:56 - 70:00)
there's no way to do that in scarlet and (69:58 - 70:03)
violet like I can't even like pay a (70:00 - 70:04)
person to be like hey can you like (70:03 - 70:06)
refresh all the raids because they're (70:04 - 70:10)
bad I like literally I don't (70:06 - 70:11)
I don't think the intended gameplay is (70:10 - 70:13)
to be like well open up your system (70:11 - 70:16)
clock and move the date like (70:13 - 70:18)
what (70:16 - 70:19)
like I don't think that's how they want (70:18 - 70:21)
us to play (70:19 - 70:24)
like for for a company that could just (70:21 - 70:26)
copy and paste features from old games (70:24 - 70:30)
and like call it a day why did they're (70:26 - 70:33)
so bent on like making new mechanics (70:30 - 70:36)
that are not better than the mechanics (70:33 - 70:38)
they had before (70:36 - 70:38)
that there's a nautily if you're (70:43 - 70:47)
listening to the if you're listening if (70:45 - 70:48)
you're watching the video version Greg (70:47 - 70:49)
and Hannah are speechless if you're (70:48 - 70:51)
listening to the audio version I mean (70:49 - 70:54)
what do you want me to add like yes that (70:51 - 70:56)
yep (70:54 - 70:59)
like there are (70:56 - 70:59)
there are frustrations with how scarlet (71:00 - 71:07)
and violet does things this isn't (71:03 - 71:09)
helping (71:07 - 71:10)
the thing that stood out to me the most (71:09 - 71:12)
I'm gonna call out one of my one of my (71:10 - 71:15)
mods one of my friends steal she's great (71:12 - 71:18)
she she came in to my stream and she was (71:15 - 71:20)
like (71:18 - 71:22)
I was excited for this event and then I (71:20 - 71:24)
I heard everything wrong with it so I (71:22 - 71:27)
went back to play Diablo 4 and I was (71:24 - 71:28)
like (71:27 - 71:30)
that that is everything in a nutshell (71:28 - 71:34)
like if you are making a new event it (71:30 - 71:36)
should be fun and exciting enough to (71:34 - 71:39)
pull you away from a current game that (71:36 - 71:40)
you're obsessed with or that you're (71:39 - 71:42)
enjoying playing like like (71:40 - 71:44)
um (71:42 - 71:46)
I wanted to play Diablo 4 last night (71:44 - 71:48)
didn't work servers were down so I went (71:46 - 71:50)
to play Apex because it was the last (71:48 - 71:52)
game I played on but I had like a good (71:50 - 71:54)
time because I was like oh there's a new (71:52 - 71:56)
event in Apex cool I like this is great (71:54 - 71:57)
I didn't know there was a new event I'm (71:56 - 71:59)
here for it I might actually go play a (71:57 - 72:00)
little bit Apex tonight because I (71:59 - 72:02)
there's a there's nothing about this (72:00 - 72:04)
event that I feel like would draw a (72:02 - 72:06)
player in and be like oh man I gotta get (72:04 - 72:09)
these one for like like (72:06 - 72:13)
it's just a bad effect (72:09 - 72:13)
yeah (72:13 - 72:17)
look I would rather have another week of (72:15 - 72:18)
chestnut because Chestnut gave (72:17 - 72:21)
significantly better Rewards (72:18 - 72:24)
and I could actually easily get into a (72:21 - 72:26)
random Chestnut raid yeah I'm not even (72:24 - 72:28)
trying to use the raid menu I'm just (72:26 - 72:30)
going through and clearing out my gimme (72:28 - 72:32)
ghoul raids and seeing what I get there (72:30 - 72:34)
because (72:32 - 72:36)
trying to use the raid finder menu like (72:34 - 72:38)
we said last week (72:36 - 72:39)
is unpleasant (72:38 - 72:42)
and potentially useless I'm so glad last (72:39 - 72:44)
week was dedicated to the raid finder (72:42 - 72:47)
menu because I the more I use it the (72:44 - 72:50)
more angry I get oh yeah (72:47 - 72:52)
like to everyone being like Oh wycom was (72:50 - 72:56)
bad bring me back bring back wycom (72:52 - 73:00)
because at least wycom didn't (72:56 - 73:02)
at least like when you connected to (73:00 - 73:04)
something in wycom it was pretty quick (73:02 - 73:06)
where it would be like yes you're in or (73:04 - 73:08)
no you're Oh no you're not in Scarlet (73:06 - 73:10)
Violet when you could when you connect (73:08 - 73:12)
there is no backing out you are just in (73:10 - 73:15)
this like this like three minute Loop of (73:12 - 73:18)
it thinking for it to be like nope you (73:15 - 73:20)
didn't get it yeah I've never waited (73:18 - 73:22)
three plus minutes for it to say like (73:20 - 73:25)
you're in yeah what this weird thing is (73:22 - 73:27)
because scarlet and violet isn't it's (73:25 - 73:30)
trying to find something to match your (73:27 - 73:32)
parameters and if the first one was full (73:30 - 73:34)
instead of saying hey that was the only (73:32 - 73:37)
one I'm gonna kick you out it's like I'm (73:34 - 73:39)
gonna search the universe to see if (73:37 - 73:41)
somebody else is doing this I'll let you (73:39 - 73:43)
know in about five hours (73:41 - 73:45)
stop it (73:43 - 73:49)
free me free me there's not even a (73:45 - 73:51)
cancel button I can't even I can't even (73:49 - 73:53)
I can't even cancel I can't even say I (73:51 - 73:56)
hit I didn't even want that one I hit (73:53 - 73:59)
the button by mistake let me undo my (73:56 - 74:01)
mistake I don't care about that (73:59 - 74:03)
Gardevoir right now if somebody is (74:01 - 74:06)
hosting a six star raid and I'm gonna go (74:03 - 74:08)
over to the little magnifying glass to (74:06 - 74:10)
like punch in the number and I (74:08 - 74:11)
accidentally clicked The Raid right (74:10 - 74:14)
before it I have now missed that six (74:11 - 74:16)
star raid because a raid is only open (74:14 - 74:19)
for three minutes and the raid I the (74:16 - 74:21)
like the the two star Teddy ursai just (74:19 - 74:23)
accidentally clicked on has now held me (74:21 - 74:27)
hostage for like five minutes because I (74:23 - 74:29)
have no way I feel like I'm getting out (74:27 - 74:31)
and when I get out and finally can (74:29 - 74:33)
refresh the one that I wanted is now (74:31 - 74:36)
gone (74:33 - 74:36)
this is this this is the worst way to do (74:36 - 74:42)
an event if if this was like truly an (74:39 - 74:45)
event like again it has nothing to do (74:42 - 74:47)
with shiny odds it has to do with like (74:45 - 74:50)
make em all five star make the rewards (74:47 - 74:52)
slightly better give me a way to refresh (74:50 - 74:56)
them like fix why car or not ycon fix (74:52 - 74:57)
what I don't even know what's called (74:56 - 75:00)
Pokey network fix it so I'm not sitting (74:57 - 75:02)
in a 10 minute queue to try to connect (75:00 - 75:05)
like but no they had to fix the raids (75:02 - 75:07)
themselves instead (75:05 - 75:10)
[Applause] (75:07 - 75:10)
s look broken (75:10 - 75:13)
um (75:15 - 75:17)
now that being said like (75:15 - 75:19)
I think the reason I brought up the the (75:17 - 75:20)
sword and shield stuff is just because (75:19 - 75:22)
an old game did something doesn't mean (75:20 - 75:24)
like a new game has to like do it as (75:22 - 75:25)
well (75:24 - 75:28)
um so like just because we were so (75:25 - 75:30)
accustomed with shiny raids every month (75:28 - 75:32)
in sword and shield doesn't mean like we (75:30 - 75:33)
should be getting or we should expect (75:32 - 75:37)
shiny raids every month but (75:33 - 75:41)
I don't blame any fan or anyone who has (75:37 - 75:45)
purchased this game to not have somewhat (75:41 - 75:48)
similar expectations of like (75:45 - 75:51)
okay well if I if I grind out raids all (75:48 - 75:53)
weekend there's a small chance I'll be (75:51 - 75:56)
able to get him small chance meaning (75:53 - 75:59)
like if I put in the work I'll be able (75:56 - 76:01)
to get it or if I like at least give (75:59 - 76:02)
this game a couple hours every day I (76:01 - 76:05)
should be able to get it or find (76:02 - 76:08)
that doesn't like you go go buy a (76:05 - 76:10)
scratch off at your gas station you will (76:08 - 76:12)
have better odds that like I think there (76:10 - 76:13)
are some scratch-offs that are like one (76:12 - 76:15)
in a hundred and you win like five bucks (76:13 - 76:18)
you will have better odds (76:15 - 76:21)
than this (76:18 - 76:23)
um and I I do get that there's like you (76:21 - 76:25)
know if somebody does stumble upon one (76:23 - 76:27)
they can back out and they can like (76:25 - 76:31)
invite people and stuff but (76:27 - 76:31)
that doesn't suddenly make this Raid (76:32 - 76:39)
event more fun no and again I think the (76:35 - 76:42)
the thing is like events should be fun (76:39 - 76:47)
yeah I was interested until again I saw (76:42 - 76:50)
it's one to five star which you can't (76:47 - 76:55)
see on this map yup and (76:50 - 76:58)
then the shiny odds were normal and I'm (76:55 - 77:00)
like I don't even like this thing (76:58 - 77:03)
[Laughter] (77:00 - 77:05)
I don't and then (77:03 - 77:08)
I would need to do (77:05 - 77:14)
four thousand four thousand of these to (77:08 - 77:15)
become at odd (77:14 - 77:17)
no no no (77:15 - 77:21)
I I okay I don't have a job right now (77:17 - 77:23)
but I have a life I'm not gonna sit in (77:21 - 77:26)
there eight hours a day scamming through (77:23 - 77:30)
gimme ghoul raids to be like Now's the (77:26 - 77:35)
Time to get the one no I no no that's (77:30 - 77:38)
okay that's not even the the one in four (77:35 - 77:39)
thousand isn't even like the bad part (77:38 - 77:42)
because I can I can I can crank out (77:39 - 77:44)
gimme ghouls no problem the the bad part (77:42 - 77:48)
is like walking across pal dance even (77:44 - 77:50)
like it's so frustrating to be like I (77:48 - 77:52)
just have to fly to the nearest fly (77:50 - 77:54)
Point yeah (77:52 - 77:56)
and then you're like oh this is three oh (77:54 - 77:59)
this is four oh this is another three (77:56 - 78:01)
yeah like you spend more time outside of (77:59 - 78:04)
the raids than inside of the raids and (78:01 - 78:06)
uh let's talk about this (78:04 - 78:09)
three plus years of sword sword and (78:06 - 78:12)
shield raids you go in it sparkles (78:09 - 78:14)
yeah like gimme gold doesn't have the (78:12 - 78:16)
best shining it goes from Gray to white (78:14 - 78:19)
but by the way this Pokemon hides in a (78:16 - 78:23)
chess you can barely see it uh (78:19 - 78:26)
and there's no Sparkle in this game (78:23 - 78:29)
like the average person that probably (78:26 - 78:30)
wouldn't even matter because they'd play (78:29 - 78:32)
this game for like 40 or 50 hours then (78:30 - 78:34)
put it down and maybe done like six (78:32 - 78:36)
raids in the likelihood of them finding (78:34 - 78:38)
a shiny in a raid is one in four (78:36 - 78:41)
thousand right so like (78:38 - 78:43)
you're promoting this as a shiny event (78:41 - 78:46)
with a pretty bad shiny not the worst (78:43 - 78:49)
shiny pretty bad because it's it's tiny (78:46 - 78:52)
Pokemon in a chest hiding (78:49 - 78:54)
you didn't think that like maybe there (78:52 - 78:56)
should be a sparkle animation why did (78:54 - 78:58)
you copy and paste that for for a (78:56 - 79:01)
franchise that loves to copy and paste (78:58 - 79:01)
commenting they always copy they sure (79:02 - 79:07)
didn't copy and paste that that's for (79:05 - 79:10)
sure like not why do they not Sparkle (79:07 - 79:13)
when you were fixing the the the the (79:10 - 79:15)
broken raids you should have like (79:13 - 79:17)
emergency updated like a sparkle (79:15 - 79:20)
animation or something like I just don't (79:17 - 79:22)
I just don't get it (79:20 - 79:25)
I don't why have it why even like I (79:22 - 79:26)
think this rate event would have been (79:25 - 79:29)
good if you just didn't turn it shiny (79:26 - 79:31)
if you would have just left it non-shiny (79:29 - 79:32)
and just been like hey there's a give me (79:31 - 79:34)
gold rate event (79:32 - 79:36)
he drops a bunch of nuggets if they (79:34 - 79:38)
didn't make it being potentially shiny (79:36 - 79:40)
the point everything else would just be (79:38 - 79:43)
a fine Raid event like if it says you (79:40 - 79:44)
have a small chance of encountering (79:43 - 79:46)
shiny form gimme ghoul let me reword (79:44 - 79:49)
this for you if you challenge uh gimme (79:46 - 79:51)
ghoul raids you will get a good chance (79:49 - 79:53)
of getting a bunch of money there just (79:51 - 79:55)
just drop a bunch of nuggets and people (79:53 - 79:56)
would have been like Yep this is great (79:55 - 79:58)
great cool I can get a bunch of nuggets (79:56 - 80:00)
like you turning it shiny (79:58 - 80:03)
and and having all of these other can't (80:00 - 80:05)
see what star the raids are gotta walk (80:03 - 80:07)
to each one (80:05 - 80:09)
um your network thing is a nightmare (80:07 - 80:11)
these launch broken the shiny like this (80:09 - 80:14)
is just a terrible event it sucks I'm (80:11 - 80:16)
sorry it's bad (80:14 - 80:18)
and I figure eventually shiny gimmigo (80:16 - 80:21)
will come to Pokemon go so getting that (80:18 - 80:22)
shiny Golden Goat will probably be (80:21 - 80:26)
possible until the community in 2027. I (80:22 - 80:28)
don't know if it'll be a community day (80:26 - 80:30)
it might just be an occasional event (80:28 - 80:32)
like meltanus (80:30 - 80:34)
understand either because like when you (80:32 - 80:36)
compare the Pokemon to meltan which is a (80:34 - 80:38)
great point where they like turn on and (80:36 - 80:40)
off the shiny for whatever (80:38 - 80:43)
reason they have for that (80:40 - 80:43)
like it's it still feels obtainable (80:44 - 80:48)
mm-hmm (80:46 - 80:50)
like like oh I gotta play 30 minutes a (80:48 - 80:51)
day and like okay I didn't get it on (80:50 - 80:52)
Monday I didn't get it on Tuesday I (80:51 - 80:54)
didn't get on Wednesday oh cool I got on (80:52 - 80:56)
Thursday great like I'll do it again on (80:54 - 80:57)
Friday oh didn't get it oh cool I got on (80:56 - 81:00)
like it feels like it's asking you 30 (80:57 - 81:02)
minutes of your time every day when that (81:00 - 81:04)
event comes around and like most days (81:02 - 81:06)
you don't get it but the day you do get (81:04 - 81:08)
it you're like cool yeah and all the (81:06 - 81:10)
days you don't get it you can't go for (81:08 - 81:14)
any longer right (81:10 - 81:14)
yeah (81:17 - 81:23)
um and I think Keck Leon and uh (81:18 - 81:25)
shoot painter dog (81:23 - 81:27)
smeargle smeargle are the other Pokemon (81:25 - 81:30)
who's shinies (81:27 - 81:32)
occasionally words Escape me (81:30 - 81:36)
occasionally sorry painter dog for 500 (81:32 - 81:37)
Alex (81:36 - 81:40)
you know paint your dog is a better name (81:37 - 81:42)
what is a smeargle (81:40 - 81:45)
[Laughter] (81:42 - 81:48)
there's paper (81:45 - 81:48)
Daisy dog uh keckley on might be always (81:49 - 81:55)
on at this point I mean yeah but (81:53 - 81:57)
smeargle is definitely an on and off (81:55 - 81:59)
painter dog is all definitely not (81:57 - 82:02)
available as shiny right now I hatched (81:59 - 82:06)
two shiny relicans during the um (82:02 - 82:09)
Hoenn tour full disclosure by the way (82:06 - 82:11)
Niantic did give me free incubators for (82:09 - 82:13)
that event because I think incubators (82:11 - 82:15)
are a big scam uh they gave me I I don't (82:13 - 82:17)
even know they think they gave me like (82:15 - 82:19)
10 or 15 free incubators before the (82:17 - 82:21)
event so I was (82:19 - 82:24)
the premium the purple ones (82:21 - 82:26)
um so I was hatching a lot of 10K eggs I (82:24 - 82:27)
ended up hatching two shiny relicanth (82:26 - 82:29)
and I traded shinarella Camp to a friend (82:27 - 82:30)
because they had a shiny hat Pikachu and (82:29 - 82:33)
I really I collect the peaches and I had (82:30 - 82:34)
two (82:33 - 82:37)
and the last day of the Hoenn tour the (82:34 - 82:38)
last like 10 minutes of the event (82:37 - 82:40)
somebody's walking by and they're like (82:38 - 82:43)
shiny calculon trading shiny kecleon and (82:40 - 82:45)
I was like what do you want for it and (82:43 - 82:47)
she was like you got shiny relicanth and (82:45 - 82:50)
I was like ah done and I made that trade (82:47 - 82:53)
instantly because my thought process was (82:50 - 82:57)
I already have the relicanth registered (82:53 - 83:00)
in the the Pokemon go Pokedex right and (82:57 - 83:03)
then I have 40 shiny relicanth in (83:00 - 83:05)
Pokemon home because the chain fishing (83:03 - 83:07)
was a thing in X and Y (83:05 - 83:09)
so what do I need this for what value is (83:07 - 83:11)
this adding to my LinkedIn profile (83:09 - 83:13)
nothing done you know what is valuable (83:11 - 83:15)
the I knew it was gonna happen they (83:13 - 83:17)
turned keckley on shiny and now it's (83:15 - 83:22)
impossible to fight I have fine five (83:17 - 83:27)
normal keclean to get Jirachi found one (83:22 - 83:30)
since isn't it ten I'm on that step two (83:27 - 83:34)
because I have the premium ticket if you (83:30 - 83:37)
win if you went to uh Vegas (83:34 - 83:40)
okay if you didn't go to Vegas you it's (83:37 - 83:42)
10. (83:40 - 83:44)
um I regret nothing about that trade (83:42 - 83:48)
that trade was perfect for me (83:44 - 83:50)
um (83:48 - 83:51)
I'm very happy I'm very happy with mine (83:50 - 83:53)
I'm gonna walk with my shiny Tech Clan (83:51 - 83:55)
tonight (83:53 - 83:58)
um anyways (83:55 - 84:01)
straight event was bad and eventually (83:58 - 84:02)
you'll be able to get a shiny gold and (84:01 - 84:05)
go through go I am almost certain oh (84:02 - 84:07)
yeah yeah I'm certain I'm certain too (84:05 - 84:09)
I'm not I'm not too worried about it I I (84:07 - 84:11)
just wish the event was fun I just wish (84:09 - 84:13)
it was like exciting to do it just feels (84:11 - 84:15)
miserable (84:13 - 84:15)
um (84:16 - 84:19)
final bit of news here is part three of (84:17 - 84:22)
uh ultimate Journeys the series is now (84:19 - 84:23)
on Netflix (84:22 - 84:27)
uh is this this is the final (84:23 - 84:30)
this is leading up to the battle (84:27 - 84:31)
but this does this not have the Leon (84:30 - 84:35)
battle it does I think (84:31 - 84:40)
uh I think it doesn't (84:35 - 84:42)
it does (84:40 - 84:42)
for the the final (84:43 - 84:46)
which is the eight episode are you (84:48 - 84:51)
talking about the Eight Episodes yeah I (84:49 - 84:52)
think this is everything before the (84:51 - 84:54)
Eight Episodes (84:52 - 84:56)
okay the last episode I remember seeing (84:54 - 84:59)
was the Darkrai episode (84:56 - 84:59)
which (84:59 - 85:04)
was like a two-part (85:00 - 85:04)
right (85:04 - 85:06)
I'm not caught up (85:09 - 85:12)
how many episodes do we have so far (85:13 - 85:16)
because there's like 100 episodes in (85:15 - 85:18)
Japanese (85:16 - 85:18)
I did not watch 100 episodes of this (85:21 - 85:25)
anime (85:23 - 85:26)
yeah much (85:25 - 85:29)
I mean they've released them over time (85:26 - 85:33)
very chunked out yes okay so Nightfall (85:29 - 85:35)
nightmares and a midnight summer night (85:33 - 85:37)
though that had Darkrai and Cresselia (85:35 - 85:39)
yep yep (85:37 - 85:41)
that came out (85:39 - 85:43)
January 21st (85:41 - 85:46)
in Japan 2022 (85:43 - 85:50)
sorry January July January 21st 2022 for (85:46 - 85:51)
U.S (85:50 - 85:55)
July 23 2021 in Japan cheese that was (85:51 - 85:58)
two years ago (85:55 - 86:02)
um and then one two three four five six (85:58 - 86:04)
seven eight nine ten eleven twelve (86:02 - 86:07)
are we not (86:04 - 86:10)
maybe I missed 15 episodes but that only (86:07 - 86:12)
brings us to (86:10 - 86:14)
74. (86:12 - 86:19)
so looking at Netflix right now (86:14 - 86:19)
they're still like 45 episodes left (86:22 - 86:26)
so this is not Leon (86:33 - 86:36)
press releases made me think it was but (86:42 - 86:46)
I'm not (86:45 - 86:49)
sure anymore part three is the one we're (86:46 - 86:52)
going into right yeah part three (86:49 - 86:53)
yeah I've I've definitely watched part (86:52 - 86:55)
one and part two I've watched part one (86:53 - 86:57)
and part two and part two ends with (86:55 - 87:00)
Darkrai and Cresselia (86:57 - 87:02)
part three goes from episodes 28 through (87:00 - 87:05)
episode 42. (87:02 - 87:05)
that doesn't sound like Liam how are (87:05 - 87:11)
there a hundred and X episodes there's (87:08 - 87:14)
the whole series in Japanese is 136 (87:11 - 87:16)
episodes (87:14 - 87:20)
and we're getting episode 60 what (87:16 - 87:22)
and this does have Leon I think that (87:20 - 87:24)
Leon is in episode 37 or 38 there are (87:22 - 87:26)
just more episodes at the end that I (87:24 - 87:28)
didn't expect because I try not to spoil (87:26 - 87:30)
it too much are they exciting is it (87:28 - 87:35)
through us I think so are they (87:30 - 87:35)
well uh ultimate Journeys was separate (87:35 - 87:42)
from Pokemon Journeys oh you're right (87:39 - 87:44)
that's the difference yeah that always (87:42 - 87:46)
confused me on Netflix there's Pokemon (87:44 - 87:48)
Journeys Pokemon Master Journeys and (87:46 - 87:51)
Pokemon ultimate Journeys that's that's (87:48 - 87:54)
where they cut it up got it I remember (87:51 - 87:56)
this they like rebranded it for some (87:54 - 87:59)
reason in ways that sound almost no (87:56 - 88:00)
different (87:59 - 88:03)
yes and you can't tell which comes first (88:00 - 88:04)
when you're trying to figure out which (88:03 - 88:07)
comes first (88:04 - 88:07)
so now I don't know where I left off (88:07 - 88:11)
actually so this might be the Leon stuff (88:09 - 88:14)
then it is yeah it is got it I'm looking (88:11 - 88:17)
at the episodes yeah uh in part three (88:14 - 88:21)
yeah because part two (88:17 - 88:21)
wow if I left off of the dark wrist yeah (88:25 - 88:32)
you're behind you're way behind because (88:28 - 88:35)
part two ends with it's probably because (88:32 - 88:36)
they're like oh we're released part two (88:35 - 88:38)
but I was like I already watched that (88:36 - 88:40)
part too but that was a different part (88:38 - 88:44)
yeah the last so part two ended with the (88:40 - 88:47)
iris Cynthia Masters eight battle (88:44 - 88:49)
oh okay okay I just want to watch the (88:47 - 88:50)
Masters in I don't care about anything (88:49 - 88:52)
else (88:50 - 88:55)
uh then you want to pick up part two (88:52 - 88:59)
okay uh uh episode (88:55 - 89:02)
boy (88:59 - 89:08)
oh I do remember 24 Remy stuff (89:02 - 89:08)
I think maybe I started watching I think (89:12 - 89:15)
the last episode I watched was the giant (89:13 - 89:18)
Pikachu versus the gianto crummy (89:15 - 89:20)
but I don't think Pikachu was gigantic I (89:18 - 89:23)
think it just ate a bunch of cake (89:20 - 89:26)
spoiler spoiler (89:23 - 89:26)
um all right well I guess I'll make I (89:27 - 89:30)
would probably have a more enjoyable (89:29 - 89:32)
time watching the Pokemon anime than (89:30 - 89:34)
doing give me gold raids I'll tell you (89:32 - 89:36)
that much (89:34 - 89:36)
yep probably a better use of my time (89:37 - 89:42)
all right well that was today's show (89:41 - 89:44)
thanks for listening thanks for making (89:42 - 89:46)
it to the end here's the question I've (89:44 - 89:48)
been waiting to ask this entire time (89:46 - 89:50)
Steve oh okay yeah yeah (89:48 - 89:52)
have you gone and celebrated grimace's (89:50 - 89:55)
birthday yet oh you better believe I (89:52 - 89:58)
have I knew there was one person (89:55 - 90:02)
celebrated the now queer icon grimace (89:58 - 90:05)
uh birthday yes I did grimace's birthday (90:02 - 90:09)
meal it was a 10 piece nugget large For (90:05 - 90:11)
Eyes on the Grimace Shake (90:09 - 90:14)
uh I mean how is the grand Mrs shake it (90:11 - 90:15)
tastes like uh you ever have a wild (90:14 - 90:18)
berry Pop Tart (90:15 - 90:21)
uh yeah I think I think I know that (90:18 - 90:23)
reference point yeah tastes like that (90:21 - 90:25)
it's just like wild berry doesn't really (90:23 - 90:26)
taste like any Berry it just kind of (90:25 - 90:29)
tastes like all the berries (90:26 - 90:33)
it's roughly Berry flavored yes it's (90:29 - 90:36)
roughly blue and red flavor yeah it (90:33 - 90:37)
tastes like that (90:36 - 90:39)
um it's okay uh (90:37 - 90:42)
I would I would get it again (90:39 - 90:43)
um (90:42 - 90:46)
but yeah it's fine (90:43 - 90:47)
I don't know why they needed a whole (90:46 - 90:50)
celebration for a purple Shake but you (90:47 - 90:52)
know Market (90:50 - 90:57)
is grimace's birthday beloved character (90:52 - 91:00)
I want the hamburglar's birthday next (90:57 - 91:01)
please but for his birth for the (91:00 - 91:03)
hamburglar's birthday they should have (91:01 - 91:05)
it be like a salad (91:03 - 91:07)
here's another question that I'm testing (91:05 - 91:09)
in McDonald's knowledge (91:07 - 91:12)
I have 26 000 points in my McDonald's (91:09 - 91:14)
app (91:12 - 91:17)
who is the McDonald's Land characters (91:14 - 91:21)
who is grimace's relative in the (91:17 - 91:22)
McDonald lens (91:21 - 91:24)
character well I don't know that I don't (91:22 - 91:25)
know what that little bird character is (91:24 - 91:28)
called early bird oh is that her name (91:25 - 91:30)
yeah oh I didn't know that (91:28 - 91:33)
yeah that's another Hamburglar Grimace (91:30 - 91:36)
Mr Ronald and then that's it I think I (91:33 - 91:38)
know there are more characters so you (91:36 - 91:41)
don't know the wonders of Uncle grimacy (91:38 - 91:43)
who is Green for the shamrock shake and (91:41 - 91:46)
who is weirdly Irish to grimace's (91:43 - 91:49)
unestated National is this are they (91:46 - 91:51)
retconning McDonald's characters no (91:49 - 91:55)
alcohol courtesy is real yeah but like (91:51 - 91:57)
are they recording him to be in charge (91:55 - 92:00)
of this shamrock shake no uncle grimacy (91:57 - 92:03)
was created be to promote the Shamrock (92:00 - 92:04)
Shake (92:03 - 92:07)
is right (92:04 - 92:12)
uh 70 something that makes sense (92:07 - 92:15)
I forget there's there's a McDonald's (92:12 - 92:18)
app on Bulbapedia and it's showing the (92:15 - 92:21)
German Shake right now (92:18 - 92:21)
because early bird was created in okay (92:22 - 92:29)
here it is uncle grimacy was 1975. early (92:26 - 92:31)
bird is when McDonald's started doing (92:29 - 92:34)
breakfast they created oh is that why (92:31 - 92:36)
she exists yeah I just typed into early (92:34 - 92:37)
bird in Bulbapedia and it gave me an (92:36 - 92:39)
ability that's not even though I'm (92:37 - 92:42)
losing my mind right now (92:39 - 92:42)
her name her name is Birdie the Early (92:43 - 92:48)
Bird yeah Birdie the early bird (92:45 - 92:51)
got it oh I'm on McDonald's dot fandom (92:48 - 92:54)
