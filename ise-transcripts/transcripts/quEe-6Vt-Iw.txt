so boring at this point that it's just weather every weather cast every episode with you guys do you want to join me talk about skateboarding yeah we don't want to talk about skateboarding i could have died steve and you don't even care you didn't even text back i was out in you you didn't even hit what are you talking about i text back he's dreaming what the heck are you guys talking about yeah i'm hiding in the basement on a friday night and you're like i'm gonna catch this shiny my friends are dying but i don't care if i'm working one day oh we bring it up on sunday so that people out there aren't worried and you're like it's so boring that you almost died if i'm working i'm working i have the the common decency not to text you at 4am because you both you boys are sleeping because we have a normal schedule no i could have like the rest of the world yeah i was going to say will actually gets up at 4. ah we got a show for you guys uh we have not a lot of pokemon news this week a little bit lighter but that's okay because we i have an interview you can probably tell by the title of the episode uh i interviewed joshua yale from ign so that'll be the second part of the interview so if we do miss some pokemon news there's always next week speaking of pokemon news [Music] i guess we start with the makeup day in pokemon go for the there's not much to say here for go fest it was fine it existed i missed it most people in america probably shouldn't complain because it was they weren't the ones that had the majority of the issues it was like new zealand and australia and asia that had way way way more issues than everywhere else but well i had some issues this morning i was trying to walk balance my bike drink a cup of coffee and play pokemon go all at the same time and there was lag too i'll at niantic no the bike coffee pokemon go combo not yeah i need a poke bike plus which is something i can attach onto the handlebar of my bike that does everything that the pokeball plus does with but not in my hand so my bike can do it for me but not in my hand can't you just wrap the [ __ ] about plus around the handlebars yeah yeah you gotta press the button but you can get one of those drinking birds from the 70s get a rubber band and wrap the rubber band around the ball have you i i'm not i i don't live with the rubber band lifestyle i'm a paperclip dude how what it's okay how are you not living the vastly superior rubber band life and going for clippy the garbage no yep who even are you will was it everything you wanted you missed you bought a ticket to both days well you had to buy a ticket to both days to go fast and you missed it and i mean i enjoyed okay i mean i'm happy that i was able to fill the fire and water segments and with this current i don't know what's happening in pokemon go right now but we're certainly certainly getting a lot of grasses i mean i'm happy that i'm able to make the progress on it uh even though i had to pay for more pokemon storage and yet also still transfer in quotes like 200 more pokemon for this whole thing to work but i mean i'm happy i get the opportunity to do the pokemon go fest stuff which i didn't do because i was yeah you know at a wedding you're one step closer to victini i love victini very much you are correct it is unova week right now in pokemon go that'll last until friday to 1 pm pacific time 4 p.m eastern s been added a mulga is somewhere again off pokemon.com it says this includes sawadle cottony and if you're lucky a mulga not shiny molga just a moga i think i got sawadel out of an egg yeah they're yeah they're i don't know if emogos and eggs but definitely swaddle and cotton earn eggs i just got a sawaddle and a cottony back-to-back there you go that's what i'm saying shiny rock and roller roller uh shiny rock and roll i got added buffalant is uh in new york somewhere uh genesect the mythical pokemon appearing in five star raids if you're looking for genesect if if you're if you're one of those uh people in the middle of nowhere with dial-up internet and one pokestop in your city of 500 people and you're looking for genesect uh both the slack community has been non-stop doing genesis with each other and the discord community is doing non-stop genesects with each other so it hasn't really been too hard to give it it's never been a better time to give niantic your money three premium raid passes at a time it's costing me so much money i'm having if issues with how much money this is costing me right now i'm not doing no more remote raids uh-uh-uh what what's the issue you have to pay for the passes you have to pay for the passes for regular raids no i get one free one every day that's the one i do that's here's the this is the five head strategy this is the big brain oh man you use your free one and you invite other people to it but then they have to pay i don't want to be the one who makes my friends have to pay for stuff they're adults i mean true in theory they're gonna they're gonna spend the money on genesect whether it's your rate or somebody else's so you might as well recruit them to help you defeat genocide but i have i have a research test which if i just bother to do it i'll get a genesect so what is the over what was the over under over was the over under on you completing that before friday before friday yeah wait what's the rush to get channel sect i don't need genesect before friday because we don't know if you're gonna turn off the shiny i don't need a shiny all right all right it's red they made a movie about it i mean i have a shiny genesect in my pokemon home i don't need no you don't i'm pretty sure there was a shiny genesect distribution dude specifically in japan it was never released in the united states i have japanese friends okay yeah yeah how do you search for things in pokemon home this is confusing as all heck oh good luck we can't spend an hour talking about how bad pokemon home is yeah we can i mean yes we can we we clearly can we shouldn't is what you're trying to say but we can clearly complete that task quite easily that one's purple hey speaking of pokemon home do you guys remember pokemon pass yeah i got that installed on my phone there's a new distribution for it at target i better reinstall it this is uh this is i just pulled this off sarah b's twitter a special dynamax crystal event to get giganta max copper raja is available in the us at gamestop through pokemon pass app remember last week when we said there's no way that the pokemon company would do a distribution that would cause a person to go outside of their house to a retail location to redeem a just a cop just just copper raja nothing's too special about it besides it hey it's gigantomax copperage true true from now until the 31st you can get a crystal that gets you gigantomax caparaja question mark is it special in any way nope it's gigantomax not all copperages can jug into mac's friends well if only there was like they can now soup in the game that yeah but then you gotta get all those mushrooms and the honeys and the this event did run in europe earlier this year i think in june and i think prior to that it ran in japan so i guess it's just making the rounds i my guess is my guess was that this was already established because it's august and they probably had a lot of things lined up for august because it was the world championship supposed to be this past weekend so what did they do last year during the world champion they had a game stop event last year and we all complained because there was no game stops in dc no game stops in dc correct what was it was not even that good of an event either it was pretty mediocre wasn't it like go to gamestop and get a sticker and pokemon pass he was like really bad that sounds about right i don't even think it was a pokemon i think was a sticker i thought they would just move this all the home though but again maybe they just made the deal with pass i don't with me who me what where is this distribution did you even say the store yeah gamestop no no no no that's not possible yeah dynamic dynamax crystal event through cop gigantomax copper raja available through gigantomax gamestop through the gigantomax pokemon pass app i can't hear it because gamestop isn't real no they're surviving by a thread i went to one in indianapolis a couple of weeks ago you are correct trying to find some magic cards i caught i kind of masculine at the one up by the laundromat that i had to go to gamestop yeah did you get your caprara well i didn't know there was copper ice thing i was sitting in there but i just got the basket and i named it blue steve thanks man i am having so much lag in pokemon go right now it's grass week california just started there oh california you eat up all of our bandwidth you eat up all of our water uh california get it together all right let's talk about the big news this week okay what is it the pokemon company have you heard of them owned by niantic yeah are they related to the pokemon company international no no okay that was a joke they're not owned by niantic the pokemon company decided that we we greg and will the royal we greg will myself are too powerful yes they launched their own podcast rival podcast we are now eternal enemies free advertising free advertising to your audience this audience could again blissfully aware that the pokemon company is attempting to take over our turf actually have you listened to their podcast i have not i have i listened to the whole thing this morning it's actually i did too it's actually really nice and i can also say not a direct competitor to the content that we provide in the slightest bit yeah so um it's it's called the play pokemon podcast it is hosted by jay blake who works at the pokemon company i met jay at the 2008 national or world championship in nashville dm'd me on twitter that weekend and then we met up and uh he's a very nice guy he's the host uh he has a very very good hosting voice uh i think his accent can be a little confusing at times what i like his voice his voice is nice his accent can be a little confusing what because you can't tell what the accent is i'm not british so some of his word pronunciations are a little difficult it's all the extra unnecessary uses make it very confusing like why is there you in there it doesn't need it this seems like uh their their episodes are dropping like every wednesday and i think their final episode will be september 9th that's what at least says on pokemon.com it says oh so it's like a short run yeah look forward to new episodes every wednesday through september 9th they even say that near the end of the first episode of the podcast where they said it was like we're covering the championship series and then we're done so so this is like cereal yes uh you won't believe the pokemon who murdered uh so what so is twisted turns left and right turns left and right i mean what they did with the cell phone records will probably make me just as angry i got asked the question a lot this week on twitch which was are you worried about them but yeah there i don't think anyone listening to it's super effective goes oh wait there's an official podcast that is so super competitive and not like covering news i'm going to go over there and stop listening super competitive absolutely like yeah their show is the it is like the i don't know football coverage of like games very much it's very very competitive i i find it i don't know if i'm sure this pokemon fan exists but i don't know how many there are what it was that thing called the venn diagram or you got the circles yeah of a competitive first off you have to like competitive pokemon one that's number one number two circle one is there's not i've gone to countless regionals battle roads uh champion cups uh worlds nationals there is already an extremely small overlap at these at these big tournaments of somebody who loves vgc and somebody who loves tcg oh uh don't forget pokken tournament because that's up in there too right that's something so if to find a person that likes all three and like you don't i don't know if it's possible to like dedicate yourself to all three even i guess you could respect it you could respect it i guess and be like ah i don't play pokemon tournament but i love watching competitive pokemon tournament or like i i don't play competitive tcg but i love watching it but i do play and like competitive vg see maybe that exists well it's the person like me who goes uh to day one to play the tcg scrubs out and then plays the bgc on day two and scrubs out i i think the other focus of the podcast as they wanted to bring to light players what i noticed a lot in the so the the show is actually formatted really really well um jay talks to people specifically in that field right so yeah you're the vgc person you're the tcg person you're the poke intern person um so i think it's i think it was structured really well but i can i can easily see somebody who's like listening to the the video game part and then it gets to like the tcg part and they're like i don't care i'm out um which those people exist like i like i don't care about pokken at all but i was like i wanna listen to it because i'm just curious of like what happens after the pokemon stuff but yeah it's very much like an espn program where they're like you know this player because right it's not just a general it's definitely not like here's how to get good at being competitive that that is not there at all but it's really a lot of stats and figures about like this is how many times this particular pokemon has shown up in you know the top competitions and these are the players who are making it to like the final of finals of the play pokemon where right like where it's sp specific for the top players and calling them out as if they're kind of like sports personalities that we should know i have no idea who shadow cat is but i haven't heard that we can talk about that 20 times it was i mean shadow cat's dark right supposedly i need to care about this that's true yeah it's it was i hate esports it's so jarring to go from like in the video game where they're they're talking about players real names oh yeah they talk about wolf glick yep and then they talk about there's real names and then in the pokken they're like ah shadowcat is is fighting blaze it 420 and then after that 69 69 is going to come on in and oh my gosh his samurai is incredible and you should see big joe four four four two nine seven two three eight with his gengar out and you're like what how did we get here what are these names i agree especially if these are people who have like you know gone to invitationals and won their spot in a set of finals because of like you should know what their real names are at this point unless there's like something about just like because in particular this is an east but bgc is just as much as an esport i i don't know right that they need to be protected or hide behind their aliases i hm i i think in like league of legends and dota they they use their names just because the names appear over the character on screen yeah um and so it's easier for you to like follow that instead of the being like oh big i don't know i'm going with big nate bignate is xx layer 420 xx and you're like it's hard to remember two things so you just say xxx layer 420. but when when it i don't know in pokemon tournament it's two people and they're your your username i don't think appears in the game and they're going to overlay the the name over it anyways that's pretty sure it does does it pretty sure um but that's not as confusing to follow as like a mobo where it's like five people versus five people it's just one versus one i i think there's a i think there's just a pro i don't know i i i feel like i relate better to real names i mean like ray rizzo wolf glick aaron zang you know these these are these are names cybertron you mean cybertron thank you very much these are names that people recognize in the vgc and then the tcg you have like jason klinsky and you have um ross j clay j j clay it was just jarring in the show to go from like real name real name real name to then like username yep i agree you're talking to a person that can't run proposed real names but i can remember their twitter handles so like that doesn't bother me i would be curious though like if people who have never listened to a podcast before because so i i got really lucky with seo back in the day and if you go to itunes and you search pokemon podcast we come up first so it's not like it's hard to find the show and we're gonna win an award hopefully but to get a person to be like i wonder if there's a pokemon podcast that's that's the struggle um because if they if they go to itunes they type it in they find it they listen to it they don't like it we we tried not gonna appeal to everyone um but there are plenty of people that haven't even thought or considered looking at a pokemon podcast so i'd be curious if somebody's never listened to a podcast they listen to the play pokemon podcast they like it the play pokemon podcast ends and then they go i wonder if there are other pokemon podcasts to listen to and then they'll find that there's a ton of shows out there but it's cool for them to do this i think i i i told the story i don't know if i told the story on the podcast where i was like trying to reach out to nintendo and stuff back in the day to get copies of pokemon and they would always they would always when i would ask and reach out like hey i'm a content creator they would be like well what's your youtube at the time i didn't do youtube i didn't you know i started doing youtube this year because i was producing so much twitch content that not everyone could watch that we moved it over to youtube i would always say like i'm not a youtuber i'm a podcaster and they're they're responsible as oh we don't do podcasts and it was like it's like this weird time where now nintendo does do a podcast it's like the nintendo power podcast that comes out once a month and now it's like this really weird time where the pokemon company is doing a podcast so being told for so long that like oh we don't do podcasts and now it's like okay cool you guys now but i also feel like every corporate company every corporate company is not a real thing every company i feel like is doing a podcast just like every company like needs a twitter tied has a twitter but i don't think anyone goes like oh man i really like laundry detergent oh god good thing tide is on twitter i would love to follow to get updated on new scents they tweet like you don't know me they wow i've been off twitter for a real long time but now you just gave me a reason to get back on i love tides options of sense i'm a i'm a tied dude i feel like it's a very common thing now with like just companies is can we do a podcast and if we can do it how are we gonna do it but cool to see them do it i thought it was worth listening oh i agree i'll get to it some other news here off pokemon.com the pokemon tcg true steel premium collection what's that i'm glad you asked if you're looking to add some steely might to the pokemon trading card game call upon legendary pokemon of the gala region the pokemon tcg true steel premium collection celebrates the powerful zashian and zamasunta with two sets they come with figures and pins and then they come with six booster packs they're 30 bucks are the booster packs good oh no oh no can you see the booster packs in the image yes yes uh what do we got we got your favorite x and y's you got your favorite sunsets and moons and solar eclipses and it looks like we have darkness looks like we have an unbroken bonds which is pretty sought after right now it's an older set though we got uh rebel clash two rebel clashes as it looks like ah gosh what has raichu on the cover that might be xy evolutions actually which sought after because of that charizard in it it looks like we have a burning shadows also sought after because there happens to also be a charizard in that one [Laughter] are they just going to put out uh charizard well darkness ablaze charizard let me char charring your blaze as charizard tell you there is indeed a charizard in darkness ablaze but what what if they just skipped it and just put out an all charizard all char every type of charmander charizard charmeleon just that's all the cards it's just an entire fire no see no one likes charmeleon or charmander people just want that's a base pokemon you don't need the ones below it i mean we could you know sprinkle them some cinderache nobody wants cinderacci everybody wants cinderacci oh speaking of cinder cinderease uh in in the in the play pokemon podcast i i don't know if you noticed this will in the in the video game part they kept bringing up stats uh-huh they kept saying like oh willowboom's number one on the leaderboard and togekiss is number three and like uh incineroar is number two yes drag algae is like number 18 or something this is my question are they using picolytics for that a non-official pokemon source to talk about on an official pokemon podcast or do they actually have stats they have stats dude you think so stats do you think that 800 that database is getting populated for every single battle that occurs if they're not doing that then i want them fired because what is the point of being connected online if they aren't stealing my data and learning how i play the game exactly yeah i'm not saying i'm not saying the poke i'm not saying game freak doesn't have stats but game freak would be the ones receiving the stats and then they would have to send it over to the fine people in at working at the pokemon company yes in washington are you saying that the pokemon company does not automatically get those reports because that's pretty much how businesses were not even reports i can guarantee that they have like an app that's built on built on some platform that's like literally called like pokemon battle stats that's like real time updated you can just go and you have a dashboard of like here's all the pokemon that have been used yeah but where did they copy and paste it from uh the ucs that remember when gts had that running oh yeah on the website they just took that and slapped it up there they actually probably have it on monitors all around their call center and they just have like the ticker tape going top ten well i mean usually sell the boom seller boom braille boom sound special uh extra bonus if you sell real boom right now um usually after uh like a tournament like the may international they do post like the top 20 pokemon being used but they don't i don't think they ever show percentages not to the public but you know they have them internally yeah i know they i'm not saying they don't have it i'm just saying so the official pokemon people on their official pokemon podcast have access to those official pokemon stats yeah why don't you think that game freak would share that's what i don't understand because gamefreak is so bad at communicating to you not to their overalls what is the reason because who cares about who cares about the consumer you need to keep your overlords happy that's the bottom line shareholders first then then consumers then businesses then your artists and then like at 400th place is the consumer oh okay and then after that's employees employees are always at the bottom final bit of dues here oh and japan's at the very bottom because they don't tell those people anything yeah they don't have internet out there final bit of news is darkness ablaze is available it's out it's here how how many darkness ablaze packs did you open uh zero i have not gotten my order yet i did order and then your twitch stream was a lie no well were we talking real packs or digital packs i've opened it doesn't matter i asked a simple question how many did you open i opened 100 digital packs i have opened zero real packs why are you throwing money away everybody knows that you trade packs for the pokemon you want that's true i opened the packs which ruined actually i had i had some sick gnarly opens will i was you know turning this you had some garlic as those of us in the tcg world call them i pulled some gnarly pokemon true some gnarly digital cards that mean nothing let's take away that frost take away from my my my pokemon uh i so i i think the the two best cards that you could probably pull from the set is uh crobat v the world tour the year is 2020 crobat is relevant again and uh alternative eternitis v max although i guess it turned into v-max is not useful without eternitis v but why because you have to you can't just play the v-max you gotta play the v and then play the v max on top of it oh what are they doing break cards again well v max cards are on top of the v cards i did not i was not aware of that mechanic i'm out oh gets that what whatever uh but on pokemon.com this is why we're having a lawsuits what that is on pokemon.com they they showcase the cards like they always have but they've actually showcased them in a way oh there's 185 cards in this set they've showcased them in a way where they they show you them working together which i feel like they might have done this before but i don't feel like they do it often i just want to just go through this they they showcase eternitis v max with crowbat v and they actually say why it's relevant here so eternitus is v max's dread end does 30 damage for each dark pokemon in play plus play corobat v which is a dark pokemon and use its dark assist ability to draw more cards hopefully finding more dark pokemon in play also you could probably put crowbat v like any deck but it works good here and then they have uh four cards and they all have the they all have the same move which is called mad party uh and then mad party so it's a bundle b a didn't a a polti geiss and a mr rhyme oh that's funny uh mad party does 20 damage for each pokemon in your discard pile that has the mad party attack if you haven't played the tcg you're probably like what what does that mean um but they actually compare it to something here on the website reminiscent of old night march decks from x and y series bundle b didn't a polti guys and mr rhyme all have the mad party attack which does 20 damage per pokemon in your discard pile that has the mad party attack discard as many cards as you can to do some damage so you would probably never play mr rhyme down or polti geist down because they're evolutions of cards you would just want to discard them and so if you're familiar with night march and the night march mechanic this is the new night march they're just renamed mad party are we spoiling this for the children greg no okay and the last combo they show on the website is rose and rudos tower uh rose which is a supporter card you're allowed to play one supporter card on your turn rose lets you attach two basic energies cards from your discard pile to one of your pokemon v-max ironically that works really good with eternitis but it comes at the cost of discarding your entire hand but rose tower which is a stadium card will let you get we'll let you draw three cards to get a fresh hand so very good if you have only if you have rows and another card in your hand you discard row you play rows put two energies on discard your the other card in your hand but with rose tower you draw three more cards and you can continue your return so that combo is also very good i don't know pokemon company if you're listening i know you i look i know there are people that work there that listen to our show do more of this this is really really good explain like why these cards work together in in a very simple way yeah also the card decks app got an update it is still useless as there is no account or cloud saved i am i have never made an ios app i i know plenty of people that have made ios apps i'm pretty sure it's really easy to use apple's icloud save feature in your app i mean you would think because they want people to they want to move people towards that yeah just i maybe they just don't maybe they don't want to use icloud i don't if only they had like like something called like a trainer trainer club account that links to the pokemon trading card game online app and links to i don't know pokemon go as well if only they had like a system in place they could link to the card decks app what a world that would be right right we don't live there for anyone that doesn't know there's an official pokemon app in the uh on android and ios called card decks and what it does is it it it category it catalogs your collection so if you bought a bunch of cards if you bought a set of dark displays and you're like i want to collect them all but with real money you can use the camera on the back of your phone and scan just hold it over the card and then it will add it to the collection so you can open up a booster pack scan the 10 cards be like oh i already had this one or oh i didn't have this one add it to your collection but if you were to transfer your data to a new phone and set up as new or you you lost your phone and you need a new phone or your kid hit the erase and install button on your phone or just delete it if just if you delete the app on accident your whole you're riding a bike you're holding a coffee your pokeball plusing your fingers on the car decks app for too long it starts doing the jiggly thing you accidentally hit the x you deleted it all your data is gone in an app about cattle cataloging your data why would anyone use this if there was not a backup feature it's very frustrating so still cannot recommend that that's it that's all the news so what we're gonna do is we're to take a quick break it'll be the interview with uh joshua yell we talk detective pikachu to sword and shield to childhood memories of getting into pokemon so we will be right back [Music] who's your favorite pokemon who's your favorite pokemon who's your favorite pokemon manchum [Music] who's your favorite [Music] vaporman paperman who's your favorite who's your favorite pokemon wamper we are back from our break and we are here with joshua yale from ign hey how's it going steve good how are you i'm all right [Laughter] it's as good as as good as we can be in this weird pandemic era we've done tons of interviews on the show we've had dan reichert from giantbomb we've had austin creed from wwe i still don't know how we got him on to talk about pokemon but uh we're gonna be i'm gonna be asking uh joshua a bunch of questions pokemon and ign related for our listeners or for anyone coming over and some are probably like maybe obvious questions if they consume you or follow you on twitter well i hope you're not consuming me oh gosh so sorry in advance if you're like uh i just tweeted that a week ago no problem before we start you work at ign uh for anyone who doesn't know what do you what do you do yeah i've been working at ign uh over six years now yeah i moved to los angeles six years ago to work at ign and i am a senior uh editor and producer of features which means i just uh write and talk and make videos about everything like movies video games tv comic books you name it that's awesome and uh pokemon is one of those things yes pokemon is a huge passion of mine it's funny uh i i got hired through the entertainment section of the site uh which is which is generally just movies tv and comics um and then we have another office where there's video games but i'm a frequent guest uh at the game's office um and actually now we're merged and we're one big office but the games folks know me because they're like okay uh pokemon guy he's here again i i wanna dive in deep with all the pokemon stuff but because we brought up ign because sword and shield was so controversial at the time feel like it still is uh how was the whole national dex stuff for you guys where there was an obvious divide in pokemon fans that were just okay with it and then fans that were not okay with the people that were okay with it yeah it was very polarizing um you know i think this the conversation had on ign was similar to what was happening elsewhere of just that some people were super passionate about it and i think yeah they're right to feel the way they feel but then some people actually are like me who who don't strive to collect every last pokemon in need every last pokemon to be present in the game and they're like oh well that's a little disappointing but i'll be fine yeah so casey at ign reviewed sword and shield yes i guess your input is not in that review so what did you think of it um yes i will just say as a disclaimer that casey defridas yeah her review is is the standing review of the site and anything i say is my own personal opinion and doesn't affect or detract from from her review or her score or anything um so i was just in love with the gallery region and all the new pokemon and i'm someone who didn't look at any of the spoilers and i just want to go in and play it for and experience everything for the first time and i got such a kick out of just catching all these new pokemon and watching what they turn into i thought the creature design in this generation was fantastic as well as you know the region and everything the gym leaders uh were all awesome this time around and how they they elevated uh what a gym match could be and where it's you know a match like a sporting event in front of a huge crowd love that uh that music that comes in i won't try and sing it but you know the chanting the dynamics chant that's good oh man so good so i i loved all those things about it uh the one thing i just really don't like and you'll if if people do follow me on twitter they know this already is that i just wish the games were more challenging again like like give me just like the gen five level of difficulty and i'd be happy but yeah uh the games they're you know they're um they're made for i think you know children uh and uh uh that's like their target audience and to please them i think they took away a lot of the the friction and resistance and and the you know the ability to fail um but i think you need that i think you need that in pokemon right that's like ash ketchum's like biggest lesson is that uh uh you can still have a good time and make friends um despite the fact that uh you didn't win the pokemon championship until uh um alola do you watch the do you follow the anime or is that just the i mean everyone knows that he won whether they watched it or not um i watch it uh intermittently like i'll like tune in and watch a big chunk of a season and then kind of fade away and then i'll come back when something catches my attention um you know i did watch of course the show when i grew up uh from from the start but then trailed off around the time the the the the gs ball mystery i was like where's the payoff uh but then yeah i've come back you know it's uh the uh the one where uh is it pokemon journeys that is that the netflix one yes yep um i thought that was was really cool and then the pokemon twilight wings which is the online mini series i thought that was so good i wish the main series would um you know borrow from that mention that you grew up playing pokemon so did that always stick with you did you i'm not sure like what was the first game you played i guess but pokemon red and my brother got pokemon blue and it just like ash ketchum was like uh up late the night before trying to decide what a starter was gonna be i had that same you know crisis very relatable ash uh yeah i ended up i ended up going with bulbasaur um and uh had a great time with that game yeah and then but i played that game like to death um and um that was like before all the free-to-play games and 800 games coming out a day you got you got one game as a kid and that was you got that until like christmas so you play yeah and if you wanted to play with somebody else you had to link your game boy to theirs with a link cable remember that and you had that's the only way you could do multiplayer like battle somebody else or to trade yeah my parents refused to buy me a link cable because what because they thought it was a waste of money because what was it what was the game back then like 30 maybe 35 bucks and a link cable was like 15 half the cost of a game so they were like yeah your friends have the link cables we don't need you to have one that's fantastic that's funny i actually have a funny story about link cables so uh maybe you don't know about this because you didn't have one but there was this trick where you could trade a pokemon from one game to another and yank out the link cable at the right moment and it would clone the pokemon you know what i'm talking about yeah that's how i got my mew right they wouldn't take me to toys r us so my friend he gave me a mew and then uh because he cloned it and then or maybe he got it from like a game shark or whatever uh the equivalent for that was um but uh i remember uh getting a little power hungry and cloning not just the mew but like mewtwo's and and you know uh all the starters and everything and i was like oh yes i have all these pokemon i'm so i'm so strong now and then i just i did uh it one more time and then when i turned the game back on the uh all my memory had gone away and it had it had been factory reset my save file with all 151 pokemon and all my powerful clones were gone that was the life back then um but twist uh i called pokemon customer service completely upset and uh they sent me a new cartridge with all 150 pokemon on that best customer service experience of my life it sounds like a playground story no i swear i swear and i i still have it to this day in like a bin somewhere but the thing that that bugged me is uh they i think they just have a bunch of cartridges with the game complete just lying around or something um because the player name was dragon and that always bothered me because i'm like my name's not dragon why would you name yourself dragon my name's joshua [Laughter] that definitely sounds like something you would hear like on the playground though of like a 10 year old being like oh i called nintendo and they sent me a new copy you know the funny part is is that uh they didn't tell me they were gonna send me the game they just heard my story and said let me talk to your dad and i was like uh okay and so then my dad didn't tell me what's gonna happen so it just arrived one day in the mail and i was like losing my mind i was like oh my god growing up did you have the pokemon fallout where you got teased made fun of pokemon not cool you had to like keep your secret no uh away from people because that was like that was like me with gen 3. i just i had to skip it because i was in middle school at that point and if you if you were playing pokemon i was already uncool but playing pokemon put me even more uncool i feel that uh so gen 3 is like your lost generation yeah i mean to this day i've gone back to it but that was the one i that was the one i completely skipped uh at the time yeah i think i was age appropriate i think i was in middle school so it was it was fine that i was into pokemon and all my friends were too actually i didn't have many friends but all the other kids were uh you know into pokemon and uh but it got to the point where it did at a lot of places where it was just so crazy that it had to be banned from the school um and i remember somebody stole a zapdos out of my binder it was just there one second was gone the next and i i i oh yeah i it was a bad day for joshua for young joshua um but i actually skipped some a lot of generations because i played the first like couple games and then just kind of moved on to other stuff and so uh it wasn't until i think like college or or a couple years after that i just randomly decided to pick up a black two for some reason okay i don't know i just started a weird one to start with i didn't even start with like black one and white one i just went right into that one and that kind of reignited pokemon for me but yeah so i have i missed some some middle generations there for sure and what about uh what about pokemon go i mean everyone played at the the week it came out the month it came out really um but did that capture your interest are you still playing it i mean oh yeah that took over my life uh when it came out and for a long time after that but it's uh it's again something that i'll put to the side for a while but then something will inevitably like draw me back in and uh i'll get playing again i'll get re-obsessed and i'll have to like try and catch up on all the things i missed and everything but actually when you put it down for a while it's actually a little bit more fun when you come back because everything is new and you're constantly getting like new stuff that's really fun and cool um or you're getting things that were really rare and scarce and valuable um before you know like maybe months earlier or even a year earlier um so that's a small little benefit but yeah i love pokemon go you reviewed the detective pikachu movie i did for ign has has your thoughts or stance changed on that movie since sorry we're jumping around i'm just looking through my list of questions i was like how am i gonna fit in the detective pikachu this one will be good it's been over a year now since that movie came out yeah you know what i uh i love that movie um uh the the plot kind of goes off the rails and it gets a little too confusing like i still to this day could not explain like what the whole like motive of like mewtwo and the plan was and everything there uh but [Laughter] but just that it brought pokemon to life in such uh vivid authentic um uh detail was just it meant the world to me and just all the pokemon felt so real and they were acting like appropriately and had like the right like personalities and everything and uh just that it got the world of pokemon uh correctly and my favorite moment is when they go and pikachu gets hurt and they go into the forest and the bulbasaur are there that's like straight out of like a miyazaki movie right like that is just like this wonderful beautiful pokemon experience and they they really uh got it right besides the the plot uh i just loved everything about that movie and the plot demon matter i was like i'm looking as long as there's a new pokemon every like one minute i'm good uh yes they certainly had that um but i actually got to visit the set of um detective pikachu when they were filming it and uh that was like a life-changing experience that was spectacular um it was the scene where they go to the underground fight club when pikachu fights charizard oh yeah so we got to walk out onto like the battle arena so walking on to like a life-size full battle arena uh where you know the the lines are painted on the ground for the pokemon uh you know you know there's like a circle in the middle and the trainer boxes on either side um and then there's like uh like claw marks and scratches and burns like on on the pavement like it's been worn like it's been used a lot and seen a lot of pokemon battles um all these pokemon trainers and and just viewers um you know uh in in the on the outskirts behind the the cage in like pokemon fashions they each had sort of like a glowing like diode like a little like wire attached to them and that's where their pokemon would be would be that's like the tracker for their pokemon um and then the for the fight uh they had two people holding up parts of a charizard one had the head and one had i don't know another part like it was like i think it was the tail um and they were in green screen suits and they were running around you know doing charizard's movement at just like a placeholder for where he would be then another guy was on the floor holding pikachu and then ryan reynolds was not there but they were playing his lines over the loudspeaker and he was like acting out where the pikachu was and then they had the live-action actor um justice smith there among all this i'm sure he felt really silly just playing around with these guys in green screen suits and holding pokemon uh body parts uh but it was the coolest thing if you didn't work at ign i would be like no that's another playground story that you're telling me and that you're lying to me uh you know what uh yeah you said earlier that like you weren't cool and i i feel that you know uh but i think you're awesome man um but like i'm not a cool person but i've had a lot of cool things happen to me uh thanks to my job you know at ign uh so just my thing is just sharing those cool experiences uh with with with all the people so you said earlier that you get to pick kind choose kind of what you want to write about and i believe how i discovered you is you were posting like more tcg stuff and pokemon tcg stuff and i don't think until recently i feel like ign has ever really covered the pokemon trading card game i mean i would assume that part of it is because you genuinely like it but another part is i'm assuming it's also getting clicks otherwise you probably would have stopped reporting on it if it wasn't gaining any traffic but is that is that pretty much the process of like hey i think that if we report on darkness ablaze that people are going to come to the website and check it out it's kind of a mix of everything you just said right um uh it's in terms this is a really long conversation that uh but the the the short version is um if i think something is cool and interesting i generally have just uh full freedom to write about it um or make a video about it or or do something with it and you know cover it for the site um and uh i'm they just trust me to use my good judgment and good taste that uh i won't like waste their time or anything or do something silly um but uh but yeah so i just love love love love the pokemon card game it's like my favorite aspect of the pokemon franchise and um uh so i just you know i remember when i first kind of got into it and as an adult because i played as a kid and then like i said i kind of stopped playing pokemon but then a few years ago i was actually hanging out with some friends and they were all into playing magic the gathering and i was like yeah i appreciate this is like a really well designed game but it's not for me like i want to play like my card game and uh so i i went with a friend and we bought some pokemon starter decks and uh it all begins and yep and then it got me i was right back in it and i was obsessed and i was like building meta decks like a week later um but uh when that you know that rush came to me i decided because i was passionate about it then i went to write uh about it for the site not knowing how it would do it's just kind of a test it actually did like impressively well um and uh and from then on i just continued to uh sparingly write about the pokemon trading card game it's not like a major beat for us right um but i generally wait until there is something cool fun or interesting that happens in the card game that i think maybe a more general fan of pokemon or just of you know nerd culture in general would find interesting sometimes it's that you know there was a charizard gx like the shiny charizard card um that sold for like over ten thousand dollars who doesn't want to hear about that right yeah uh stuff like that or if um you know i have an article going up about how um there's a i think the way i phrased it was like this bundle b can kill god and it's like it's just a a a bundle b card that when you know it when it meets the the mad party uh criteria of having enough pokemon in the discard pile with the mad party attack it can do 300 damage which is enough to knock out the uh arceus dialga and palkia card oh yeah it has 280 so that's just my way of just trying to make things relatable for people or to make them turn their head and go wait what i want to learn more about that and then i've tricked them into reading a deck profile [Laughter] and then they're on amazon adding booster packs to the cart you're super into marvel star wars pokemon that's that's the that's a lot of very passionate and very i would i would say argument of it argue fans i like to argue is that is that not exhausting for you well i don't usually get into the arguments because i just like to talk about what i love about these things and i don't choose sides like some people are like only marvel or only dc i'm like why not both like they're both like so good and sure there are things that i like about one and not the other and you know and vice versa but that's that's the same with anything and uh i would rather just have more good stuff than try and like choose sides and argue with people on the internet which is like the most pointless thing ever um and yeah and just have a good time and just share my love and enthusiasm for things um rather than anything else i feel like this is maybe a relatively new thing on the internet well new being maybe in the last two years of just you guys or other outlets reviewing a game and then it just getting review bombed on amazon or metacritic and stuff even even a game that just came out fall guys got review bombed because the servers weren't working yeah yeah i i guess the answer is it's not going to affect you guys and your what you do at your job but i'm sure that is something talked about or looked at or is at least covered uh in the news of like this is not a good solution to these people's problems is giving it one star on amazon or maybe it is i don't know maybe it works i can't it didn't work for sword and shield the game sold 18 million despite being review bombed on both amazon and metacritic yeah the whole that's a whole conversation isn't it of just i think people are just looking for an outlet when they're displeased and that's a place they know they'll be heard or at least be seen right because they know that something they can influence uh to to show their displeasure with something and uh it's such like a it's a multifaceted issue because fan feedback has never been more instant and never had a bigger impact and sometimes it's people being trolls and people being jerks and it's very toxic um but sometimes uh you could argue that it's good uh like sonic the hedgehog people were very clear that they're like no that's not sonic that's nightmare fuel and uh yeah and then uh now sonic uh after the redesign um is uh i think the most profitable uh video game movie ever right and uh so really worked out for them because they listen to fan feedback but i i do think there is a balance uh that needs to be struck i don't know if we will ever get there um but it is very difficult um uh especially because uh i think when one kind of studio gives in to the fan demand you then have a sense of entitlement uh to for people who are thinking okay well well they listen and they got what they want so now i'm gonna get what i want and uh and it's sort of like it's very childish right so i think if people were a little more reasonable about it and didn't just you know take out their anger on a property or a game by review bombing it i think we'd all be you know a little uh we'd all be a little less stressed um uh but i do see online that uh you know uh i i'm not sure which outlet it is is it was it metacritic or one of one of one of the you know review aggregates i think it's not a critic uh well they added a 24-hour window where you couldn't uh you had to wait before and play the game or watch the movie or whatever uh before you got a chance to actually review it and that was in an effort to uh not have those knee-jerk reaction review bombs yeah so i think things doing things like that is a it's a good solution like you know uh most people get angry in a moment and then it passes so i think if you don't give them the ability to review bomb something in the moment maybe maybe that is uh a good solution i don't really know the results of that that test they did with that but i think i think that's a step in the right direction of some people don't have any chill so you have to like you know enforce a little chill yeah do you do you guys i'm assuming i don't i can't say the last time i've looked at ign comments but i'm just i'm assuming you guys still have people upset about just a number and didn't read the review yeah i mean there's always going to be people like that but no we do talk a lot about reviews and how they're um what you know like did we get across what we wanted to is as you know you know uh what does the number mean uh we've we've uh actually recently uh gone from having a 100 point scale which is where you have like a decimal point where something could be like i gave this a 5.2 or 7.9 and now we're doing a 10-point scale where it's all just a whole numbers where you get it gets a seven an eight a nine a ten and it's just like that because we found that people were really focusing on those decimal points and they were like going to like another game they got like a 7.3 and like well this game got a 7.1 but how could you and it's like they were they were focusing on the number too much so by making the numbers less uh granular and making them whole numbers um the idea was it would move the conversation off the number and back onto the game which is the whole reason we write a review in the first place um and i do commend other outlets that have uh um just done away with numbers at all but when you do that you don't wind up on sites like the review aggregates and your your review reaches less people um yeah so i think that's another reason in favor of keeping the numbers there but yeah i mean reviews will always be a uh a hot topic uh you know no matter where you are uh on the internet ign or elsewhere i think the uh and i i don't know maybe you guys have seen success with this i think your video reviews been great like you can scroll down you can see the number and then you go ah this is a lot of i don't want to read this but then you just press play and pretty much somebody's reading it to you uh at that point yeah i i even before i worked at ign i always loved uh the um the video reviews just because they were so in-depth and they illustrated what they were talking about uh with the game and or with movie or tv show or whatever is being reviewed um and that i ign was always a dependable place for me to go to get a good look at a game before i went to buy it speaking of video too uh i saw you on a podcast uh right after they announced pokemon snap everyone seemed pretty pumped about that yeah i mean that's one of those games that uh for for like you know original og uh pokemon fans like like uh like you and me um that game like hit the sweet spot of of just being uh kind of like i was saying about detective pikachu of just bringing the world of pokemon to life in a really fun novel way um and i think people now who've like played pokemon go and stuff and didn't play snap would be like well what's the big deal you're just taking pictures of them i can i can put a bulbasaur in my living room and take a picture of it on the table you know pokemon go but no there it was it wasn't just taking pictures right it was like uh it was a puzzle game it was on a timer right and so and you had to like do things in a certain uh order and and and beat the timer because you know if you took too long throwing your apples at the you know the charmeleon uh you missed the photo of charizard right so you there was there's all these things you had to learn and unlock about this game and it rewarded playing you know replaying it over and over again uh and then of course there was that that beautiful uh psychedelic space level where you could get a perfect 10 000 point picture of mew at the end that's just like that's the dream right for pokemon fans like that's just like it just encapsulates the pokemon experience um in a way that's that's not the traditional pokemon formula of like catching and battling uh but it's still just awesome just as awesome so i think yeah there's a lot of hype for for new pokemon snap and i can't wait to play it i think it has uh big shoes to fill with i think uh in in the original it was it was relatively short although as a kid it would probably seem like the most fulfill fulfilling game ever but you know only like 63 pokemon i think like six levels and then the seventh level was that sick i never heard anyone describe it as psychedelic but yeah the psychic delic space level it's pokemon so i can't imagine they don't put a 60 price tag on it but what do you do you think there's anything they need to do like does it have to hit you know at least 500 pokemon does it have to have this amount of levels like i feel like games have such high people want so much more out of a 60 game nowadays i feel like yeah um i wouldn't be surprised if they do the thing where they're constantly adding new content it's one of those kind of games as service kind of things um they haven't said what it's going to be but i could actually see that happening like just starting with like a base adventure and then every couple months a couple times a year they uh they come out imagine that they're like oh here's an another level where we've like hidden you know 50 new pokemon because you know there's over a thousand pokemon now there's plenty to get through there's no way it's all gonna be in the base game and uh uh i think it would be unrealistic for people to expect them all to be in the base game at least yeah um uh but uh but yeah i think i think that would be cool now that i'm talking about it i think it would be it would be cool i think it's it's gonna be obvious that they're gonna have like all the fan favorites in there and then a couple unexpected ones and stuff but uh but i think what it needs to have it just it does need to have that sort of element of tension where you're on like i don't want it to be like where you can um uh just go off into the wild and take pictures i actually wanted to be on rails uh because that that was part of the puzzle game right you had just it you had to stay on the path it put you on and do everything within a certain amount of time uh and that that was what was what made it fun and addicting and wanting and you wanted to like run it again and again and again until you got it right and you found everything um so i definitely want to keep that core experience uh in the game and then yeah i wouldn't i wouldn't be opposed to them just expanding the game um you know as a service it's worked for animal crossing hey is there any pokemon memory that stands out to you in the last 20 some years that that you haven't brought up i mean you got back in with gen 5 zapdos stolen on the playground [Laughter] don't bring it up um i will say that when i got back into the tcg a few years ago um i was just adamant about doing it very casually because there was like the world championship you could qualify for but i thought that was just like too much but uh last year um one of my friends actually qualified and i thought wow i was like so impressed and i was like well wait a second if he can do it i can do it so i i tried my hand at qualifying for the pokemon world championships uh uh to cut to the end of that story i did it uh and i was in march of this year or was the end of february yeah whatever the um it was like on uh was it dallas or knoxville it was the end it was like a big regional uh tournament was knoxville uh it wasn't houston uh i think i think it was in in knoxville um but uh i grew up before coveted right right it was on the on the cusp right we i think we had just heard about it and we weren't really taking any um safety precautions yet like nothing had been shut down yet i do remember not shaking my opponent's hands and just being like let's just do a fist bump just just because you know we didn't we didn't know anything about the virus at that point uh but just just for safety we'll do fist bumps uh but for in that tournament um i actually did my career best placement it had like 600 plus people but i got 10th place and that awards you a bunch of championship points and you need 500 to get a world's invite and so that put me over the threshold and so that that was like one of the happiest moments i'd had because uh it had taken like eight months of you know practicing training uh traveling to tournaments all around the us um playing in tournaments like pretty much uh every weekend or once or twice a week um and grinding trying to get those 500 points um and i live in southern california in los angeles area and it's like a super competitive area like millions of people live here and it's like some of the best pokemon players um in north america all live in my neighborhood so it's like it's really you know just to get go to a league challenge like you have to face the best of the best and that's like the lowest level tournament that's only worth 15 points um but anyways uh as i was playing um in uh these like regional tournaments which are like the big you know tournaments that have anywhere from like 500 to a thousand people i finally got uh i was like doing better like i i finished like 120th and one and then i got like 110th at the next one then i got like 47th place in the next one and i'm like okay and then the most recent one yeah i got 10th place and i was like wow i'm getting like better and better and now i have enough points to play in worlds like i had so much momentum and i was so happy but then of course they canceled the world championships and they postponed it until 2021 they are rolling over the invites so i will get to play um next year although there's this whole thing where they added an extra day onto the event for 2020 qualifiers um and then if you had gotten the the proper amount of points for the next year then you would skip that day and go uh so it's like you kind of have to earn two invites to get a normal invite it's this whole thing anyway yeah well um hopefully things are better where there can be a worlds next year you know i have my fingers crossed so hard they're about to break but you know uh safety first you know uh i wouldn't want them to rush or do anything before you know they're ready but when you think about it will it be safe to have an international convention where the players are going to come and sit in a room together for like three days on end and uh uh you know touch each other's cards and shake each other's hands and then like go eat nachos you know like like uh will it be safe to do that a year from now i don't know i certainly hope so i hope so um but i was extra excited for worlds um not only for the chance to compete which is its own cool thing but it was going to be in uh in london and next years will be in london as well but i thought that because you know sword and shield this the gala region is based off of great britain and they were having the world's uh after sword shield in london i thought that was just too perfect and awesome um and i was very much looking forward to that but uh it didn't happen um but you know being your best memory in your worst memory it qualified but then didn't get to actually go here let me let me give you a happy memory uh just to put a cherry on the top of this um well uh i've never been like the most popular guy and don't have like a lot of friends especially since i moved to los angeles um i find it really hard to like meet and keep like good friends uh but when i started playing pokemon like the pokemon community is like super nice and awesome and uh there's everyone's just like automatically your friend because you're you're all just there to play pokemon when you show up at these tournaments and stuff so i'd like a local store that i go to and uh it was my birthday last year and i didn't um throw a birthday party for myself because i was like i don't even think i know enough people uh who would show up and like celebrate my birthday i know this is really depressing uh everyone at home sorry uh but i went to you know weekly pokemon league night uh just to play some cards and then they uh the whole um um group there surprised me and got me uh a birthday pie because they know i don't like cake and they sang me happy birthday and then some people even got me like cards is like a gift and i was so moved and i was just like that is like the power of pokemon there just everyone is just so welcoming and awesome and like and uh is would do something like that for you and i'd even ask for it and then so that is like my my really happy pokemon memory dang there was a lot in that last like five minutes it's a real emotional roller coaster have you been to a world tournament just as a spectator i have a spectator for a couple times i was covering them uh for ign oh okay okay yeah they're really they're really funny now uh i it seemed so unattainable uh which is why the memory of of getting the invite was uh you know it was so special yeah i would always i would i've been to three four uh and i've always told people if even if you can just attend and you're a pokemon fan it's it's just worth being around all those people oh yeah it's like uh pokemon's comic con or e3 you know it's like it's pretty much a big pokemon convention where people from all over the world just come in this big building and enjoy pokemon together and there's so much to do besides the competition of just hanging out there's like pokemon go events and uh you know video games there's side events and trading card game side events and little events and then usually that's when they uh take the stage and unveil new things coming up in the pokemon world like new video games sometimes they announce new pokemon uh when the movie came out that they had the detective pikachu cast come out and do like a wave uh so yeah a pokemon world championship uh is is definitely uh like a must it should be on the bucket list of every pokemon fan well i don't want to eat up too much more of your time i got one question probably probably the hardest one of the the interview uh oh what is your favorite pokemon [Laughter] um it is psyduck it's it's it's definitely psychic i have a lot of love for a lot of different pokemon but it always comes back to psyduck um because he's just really stressed out all the time and i can relate to that but no but then when he unleashes the stress when he gets once he gets focused right he does that thing where he like psychically lifts everybody into the air and like pebbles off the ground and becomes this unstoppable force once he gets his stuff together so i like i like to i think i like to think i can relate to that that's awesome uh well joshua thank you for being on i really really appreciate your time oh well thank you so much for for having me uh for having me on yeah yeah where can uh my listeners find you i mean ign but but should they should they look for something uh is it easier for your twitter youtube anything like that um yeah if you want

spelled y e h l i don't know why it's spelt like that just go with it um and uh and then yeah on ign uh you know any given day i post content covering all the topics uh i mentioned and more um and you

catch up next week it's like why do you lie like this is why a pokemon company created another podcast yeah full of truths and not your alliances okay before we get to the 30 seconds of news uh number one is we were slightly mistaken last week about the podcast awards you cannot vote [Laughter] it doesn't let you vote anymore um so we did get nominated for a podcast award so thank you to everyone who voted the first time around um so from the terms of service which we still have to start a tos podcast i'm in it i'm on it 500 000 people voted for different shows i i suspect 400 of the 500 000 people voted for our show but that that's cannot confirm or deny that but for the second round of voting which we're on right now that ends at the end of the month only 5 500 people from the 500 000 voters got sent an email to vote again so uh if you got that email you are allowed to vote again for our show if you did not get that email you don't get to vote for round two i don't know why they did that but that's a thing i guess so fingers crossed that things work out i guess so if you did vote check your email should say podcast awards check your junk folder you are specially selected to i'm assuming the secondary votes have more weight that would probably be my thought process well i think that votes actually have the vote right like they're the ones that are determining the award what we did was to get the top 10 choices yes so they did say there was like before means you got in and now it's these 5 000 people who are actually making the decision right plus i think there are like eight judges that are also helping with the decision so that's that uh two weeks left on our kickstarter that'll be in the show notes um oh i gotta contribute to that kickstarter is my lawyer will let me and available we'll talk about it we have images of what the uh cassettes look like now on the kickstarter and we just put up stretch goals this past week on the kickstarter um so that's all there so you got two weeks we'll remind you because next week will be the last week uh if you want to get the break music on um on cd or cassette i mean it's digital download too but uh and we're still working with the artists to um do the the books and stuff so it'll be really cool okay the news we missed coco the movie the one that's in that the one that was supposed to come out in july but didn't come out in july the the rude and the shiny celebi one and everything like that this is from brandon from our slack community comes out on christmas 20 christmas day only in japan japan december 25th they said they would delay it till the winter they have decided on a date it is it is christmas in japan which i think is like a big kfc day i'll have to check with andrew pretty sure pretty sure kfc is like i remember and so andrew is a resident japanese correspondent um yep i remember him saying that like fast food restaurants will try to associate themselves with a holiday so then they like have just record sales on that specific day so kfc did that with christmas i think i mean it's not a bad idea yeah i mean kfc like didn't i don't think they deliberately associated i think that was much more of a happenstance they became associated with christmas and thus make a lot of money over christmas they also didn't they also have a final fantasy 14 promotion was that kfc ooh kfc in japan i think probably ever do i felt like we reported on news where you had to order like a family meal to get like a giant chocobo and then uh chinese final fantasy 14 players are eating inhuman piles of chaos china yeah they wouldn't let you you couldn't throw the food away otherwise you wouldn't get the chocobo we did report on this because it was that dumb [Laughter] well you can't be wasteful is the play pokemon podcast gonna report on kfc in china i think not i think not uh you need to play the game you're not going to but you should uh is there a free login touch period probably not yeah there is you can play from levels 1 to 60 for free i'm already i passed that well then you nothing for free you you have the taste you know what you can do okay but here's the thing i got i have two 30-day free through two 30-day codes that i bought it was there they did some sale or whatever on square enix.com or dot-net i don't even know what square enix owns i bought it i have to redeem those and then they become active and then the time is clicking the the time is clicking and or ticking and then i gotta pay the what 12 to move to gilgamesh which is overpopulated now you can move to anything on that server like on that server bank because world transfer is a thing yeah but i might as well move to where you are true which i told you over a year ago and you didn't listen to me i told you why i moved to an empty server and i told you why that was a dumb idea it was a dumb idea and now you're trapped on an empty server i have not tried i look at what is it 12 to move i'll pay the 12 i think it's 10. let me tell you what happened though greg this game called fall guys came out and all i want to play is fall guys not final fantasy i'm gonna have to look at this game cause it just doesn't seem like it's any fun oh it's it's it's something when it's on switch tell me because apparently if i play it on pc i'm a cheater yeah the pro players are playing on ps4 that's very true what's that who's even a pro player me that just yo you are not you won like three crowns no no no i'm up six crowns now greg yeah that's going on my linkedin profile you don't even have you don't even have your shiny pokemon on your linkedin this is the fraud this is why there's a lawsuit let's look at my linkedin profile hold on hold on hold on how do i see how many snome i've knocked out on linkedin wow yes where on my linkedin profile does it automatically update with the number of snome that i've knocked out in that game freak has a share of linkedin um in the pokedex where i looked in the pokedex it doesn't say oh i looked out yeah it'll say it'll say pokemon defeated oh i'm gonna have to check that again later i'm doing like 30 a day that's got to get me to the big number soon you're well are you knocking them out or you're hatching them because hatching them don't count knocking don't count i paid attention during that portion of the podcast that's what we discussed improving your shiny odds i am literally on your linkedin profile now who's wills yours are we linked send me a request i don't know if we're from we gotta connect we got a network greg you are a first connection this is how you don't pay attention to your linkedin this is why there's lies i have been connected to you for years years and you're sitting here telling straight up lives about your crown age write me a recommendation for what will lie to you about his shiny account is what i'm writing right now great entertainer very funny charismatic uh look i'm writing it for you skills and endorsement my options are logo design no i don't know the ic logo i did you it's pretty good time management sure definitely not on that one i could maybe maybe write an enjoyment under podcasting after this lawsuits okay all right all right yeah no nothing now nothing now nothing now ask everyone to uh up their kickstarter pledge right now to help pay for the lawsuit uh three accomplishments three projects yeah yeah don't look at my linkedin dang i took a screenshot of those questions last week and now i can't find them well they're gone forever at the time oh wait no that's not it oh i found it [Laughter] [Music] catherine writes in from our slack community what what oh sorry i'm on strike strike strike strike strike strike don't even get a scat i've already heard your scabs that you bring in to do these songs make sure okay to make up for it i'll make sure to recommend on linkedin the musical and whatever musical and dancing recommendation you were the worst video on demand seems to be the current plan for a lot of movies these days how much would you pay to rent or buy the new pokemon movie if that option became available so by new pokemon movie we mean coco coco or i'm we could even say detect let's just say detective pikachu too isn't didn't they say that like some mulan is gonna be like forty dollars to rent thirty thirty ninety nine it's 29.99 live action something that was already done better as a cartoon well we don't know that it was done better as a cartoon chances are very good that it was done better as a cartoon but uh disney plus will you'll be able to watch it for a thirty dollar fee but you're already paying like seven dollars a month to get into disney plus yeah um look number one there's no disney in my house they can plus all they want okay number one if you go to a movie in new york city which i did once like even even 20 years ago that alone for two people was easily 30 dollars yeah easily so a family of four having to pay thirty dollars to watch mulan to keep their kids quiet for however long that movie is they will pay that money for a piece of money a family of four i'm a barely a family of one okay well then we i will drag the tv outside we will socially distance and that will be three of us you can bring you can bring whoever you want that'll be a family that'll be a family of five and two dogs it's a family of seven for for thirty dollars it's a bargain i don't know if this works do you think this is gonna work yeah it works for trolls if yeah but trolls wasn't thirty dollars it was like ten wasn't it okay and let's to clarify for the people who heard the word trolls and just thought like basically all the people that watch steve on twitch uh trolls world tour was a movie yes and wasn't it like marcus or amc that got really mad and was like we're not gonna let you show movies in our theaters again they they did do that they did say you know what uh nah dawg uh isn't it on amazon prime is that who did who released it i don't know for a pokemon movie i would happily pay up to 4.99 but i would prefer to pay 1.99 i think the most i would pay for a brand new movie that i couldn't see in theaters because of economic times would maybe be 15 bucks oh you would go that high if it was a new detective pikachu i would probably pay up to 10. but i i strongly believe that netflix is going to just pay for a movie outright to show up disney i they would netflix has already produced movies and yeah yes paid for movies outright they produce their own movies right no but i'm saying like they they cl they definitely paid for mewtwo strikes back or whatever so i could see them paying for coco and being like coco is exclusive on here just for free stick it to to stick it to disney and to stick it to these other platforms um i would pay at most for a poke upon movie in my home at most 2.99 why if i had a bad guy at 15. i thought you guys were gonna say like ten no okay i would pay ten dollars for the movie theater experience that has a great sound a huge screen in my home i'm not bothered by anything i usually will go on a matinee or on a tuesday so it's eight dollars that is an experience i'm willing to pay for although pokemon has a history of doing terrible movies so when i went and saw the power of us which was furry i wanted my money back for the time that i lost there so given the fact that their track record is mostly abysmal full disclosure we got free tickets the power bus free ticket to power of us oh i took it remember we were going to do something oh we were recording uh b team and i was at that instead because it went up for free uh so given that i would maybe pay 299 like if if people said it was really good but they'd have to say it was really really good like it's the best movie in years and by people i mean not steve yeah basically i didn't say the power of what's good no awesome you think a lot of pokemon movies are good that aren't no i don't i say they're okay so my other thing though is i i just don't i it's so rare for me to consume passive media if it's not youtube skate bits so it's gonna call you out so hard because you so do you watch skaters and bikers go down a bike trail a piano okay i watch craze i was there freestyle bike videos i watched skate vids from the 90s and early 2000s yes that's sweet i don't watch gator tracks i don't watch movies that are movies i don't watch tv shows that are tv shows if it doesn't feature some dude doing like a frontside 50 50 down to nine i'm not interested so you wouldn't see tony hawk the movie is what you're saying i mean tony hawk ain't making no movies with that attitude look they're getting desperate the last movie i rented off itunes which was like a month ago was the uh the sonic movie uh and it was all right i lost i want to see the original cut yeah release the sonic director's cut cowards it was okay it was where i think it was 5.99 to rent it yeah that's pretty standard i thought i thought it was worth the six bucks at the end of the day i mean if it was a bad movie i probably would have said dude would have said it was not worth six bucks but i was i was uh entertained for the 90 minutes or whatever how long it was i was like yeah that was a good use of my time i laughed it was funny it was fine it was sonic it went real fast he did go fast yeah i have no clue how good or bad coco would be but i feel like if for whatever reason it came out here on netflix on christmas day if it came out here on netflix christmas day for free i will watch it i will watch just about anything pokemon related for free i don't think the pokemon company and disney are doing anything together anytime soon but if for every reason they came on disney plus and they were like ah you can watch it for 20 bucks no i don't think i don't think i can do that no no no no no no no no no no no not unless there were like eight to ten of us in the room because i was collecting two dollars from each of you then venmo me your your portion of the movie tickets passing around the pan like if somebody says mulan is excellent excellent excellent like such a better version of it i may consider maybe but nah like i look so i have amazon prime and when i get to the thing where it says like you can rent this i'm like nope i'm out there so much for free there's just so much for free i have netflix i turn it on i scroll through i'm like there is literally nothing here i want to see and i turn it off and go to a sick girl skateboard vid i need to see if netflix has skateboard vids to lure you back into they do not family they do not does netflix not have gleaming the cube get out of here with your trash mouth uh well give us our pokemon of the week last week's pokemon of the week uh was from sinnoh uh it is an ice type um which is actually very strange that it takes a long time to get to the ice types in sinnoh even though it's a northern territory which you think it'd be colder look you're talking about the region that has two fire pokemon one being ponyta well either way uh so the first ice type that appears is a mono ice type um and then you have this one or it has to be primary ice type so not ice type as the second type um you cannot you can only catch this pokemon in the wild in black and white and black and white too there's literally no other game does it ever appear in the wild so only in univa are there wild of this running around um and you if you do want to evolve it you have to follow a special condition it has to i'll give you the clue i didn't give last week it has to know a special move um which is similar to what tangela needs to know in order to evolve into tan growth um and then i referenced a science article about trying to restore from some frozen dna but it's not a dinosaur so who is that pokemon it's cantonian sandslash yes correct because cantonian sandslash requires special conditions to evolve which that's something we had in gen 1. man i'm so good at this it's mammal swine it is mammo swine all-time favorite pokemon i love mammo swine so much i don't like its eyes i wish its eyes were different otherwise shiny was different is that why x and y is your favorite game because you ride on one well i love i love writing on ammo swing i don't know i was so i wanted pokemon writing to be so much more than what it ended up being i really thought that in x and y there was gonna be like a race like your mom's like i'm a world chris i'm a world-class horn racer and you're like oh cool maybe later in the game i'll race a rhyhorn and you're like no no that doesn't happen nah nah i mean that's your mom's thing that's not your thing exactly it's all about breaking free from your your parents and discovering your own identity at age 10. yeah i think you were like 14 in x and y oh probably 13 or 14. you don't like the ski goggles i like the ski gog a lot no there's just something that's like too the sunken i think that's that's my issue some trivia here mamo swine would have been obtainable in both gen 2 and gen 3 if it existed as piloswine how is that trivia as pilots said sure you could learn ancient power in both generations so that's the thing is that the pokemon has to know ancient power in order for it to be able to evolve saying is like tangula couldn't learn ancient power in two or three right um no other pokemon has the same type combination as mammal swine and it's pre-evolutions uh and mamo swine and its pre-evolutions are the only pokemon weak to all three starter pokemon hey that's actually really good trivia that's that one's a good one here you go way to finally get it finally get it done bubblepedia it's a pokemon swine is a comet has a combination of mammoth and swine you don't have to has that uh shuffle icon there it's good uh sweet it's good it's good there you go it appeared in uh you know it appeared in pokey park we pikachu's adventure it did was just the iceberg zone mammal swine is like the number one i want you to fix the shiny well that's not gonna happen i know it's just such a gross green now if it was called charo swine it'd be black and sleek and cool yeah it'd be black and red and purple and oh wow week's pokemon um this is gonna be real long and real boring so love it get get some caffeine get a cup of coffee something like that here we go as we have now reached my personal eighth anniversary of that should be eighth start again as we have now reached my personal eighth anniversary of appearing on this program we will once again discuss one of my favorite pokemon of all time tickles tickles was one of the key pokemon that i brought to pokemon us nationals in 2012. i thought it looked really cool with a w on its head matching the w in my name i distinctly remember that i knew absolutely nothing about competitive battling at the time and had pretty much only brought a team so that i could battle with wheels and irene who were also in the vgc competition my memory may be flawed here i just checked in pokemon home and tickles is currently at level 67. i don't think i ever used her after 2012 us nationals so that's where she is frozen in time i do know that my main tactic in using tickles was to try to use fisher a ground type one hit knockout move for those in the know oco moves are never used in competitive vgc because they have a very low possibility of hitting even with accuracy improving items by the time everyone at dinner the night before had informed me that my pokemon and moves choices were garbage that my pokemon needed held items and they should all be over level 50 i realized i didn't stand a chance in 2012 i did not have a good sense of pokemon tools available on the internet tickle's other moves were aqua tale earthquake and future sight she received stab from aqua tale an earthquake and i've never been able to figure out why this particular pokemon has access to future sight future sight is both a weird and terrible move she has a docile nature meaning that none of her stats were improved or hindered and her ability is anticipation her pokemon species is one of the few non-psychic types that can have anticipation as an ability and they are the only ones including her pre-evolution with her type combination that can have it at all anticipation which causes your pokemon to shudder if one of the opposing pokemon has a super effective move is a terrible ability to have in pokemon vgc smogon has sorted tickles into its pu tier as they describe their lowest official usage-based tier with the following overview with access to dragon dance a fairly rare move for pokemon and pu and a typing that allows it to resist types that are fairly common in pu tickles may seem like a good choice for a setup sweeper however in reality it has horrible offensive and defensive stats that make it extremely difficult to do damage and seem like a threat tickle's lack of coverage and severely disappointing stats even at plus one make it near impossible to sweep an entire team as its terrible speed allows it to get revenge killed very easily that makes it very difficult setting up without fainting there you go that is the pokemon of the week if you don't know it by now do some research figure it out all right we will be back next week of course two weeks left on the kickstarter if you're interested in that a huge shout out again to joshua yale for being on today's episode hopefully you guys enjoyed the interview um i am still in talks with i think two
