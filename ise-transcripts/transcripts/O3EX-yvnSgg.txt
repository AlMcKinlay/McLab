[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 438th episode of the pokemon podcast it's super effective i'm your host sbj with me is will internet scam alert this uh podcast is internet now i i i had two things to say but i'm going to leave it at one recently purchased trx are you familiar with trx is that a graphics card no it's a clanging and banging thing except that you don't clang and bang it's literally a canvas strap with handles at either end that you hang from your door frame or from the ceiling so you can do exercise bodyweight exercises when your gym is closed why did that cost me 200 dollars wow a canvas strap with handles at the end why the answer is they're taking advantage of my desperation and my shrinking muscles doesn't your seven million dollar a month a fancy apartment complex have its own gym okay closed do i need to post more screen caps of the facebook group for my seven million dollar a month fancy apartment building i want nothing to do with these people the faster i can get out of here the better all right greg also here i am here i spent 60 dollars on resistance bands and they're quite nice what happened to ring fit adventure i do rings and adventure on the non muscle building days because ring fit adventure is mostly calisthenics and some some toning but the resistance bands are actually muscling build muscle muscle builder exercises like just have the resistant bands on while you do ring fit no a because bring fit asked me to do a whole bunch of stuff that doesn't make a whole lot of sense and b you need to focus full body workout then cardio workout full body workout then cardio workout i mean i am level 57 why would you slack off dude ring finish choice i think i think i stopped at 55. what where are you in bro i got through the one where you had to do the elite four oh yeah that was two worlds ago oh yeah i'm the world after the elite four wait speaking of misinformation that comes from greg oh here we go i so you know now once again compensating for my lack of access to gym facilities on saturdays i try to go about 30 miles on my bike so yesterday i was like greg back in the days when pokemon go was a game that you played out of doors used to speak about this mystical place where he would go on community days called victory memorial park because all of the memorials were poke stops yeah dude i went there yesterday i biked the east west and north south legs of that entire park there was one memorial you're fibbing what there's only one memorial in the entirety of victory memorial park it's right at the l it's like an l of grass and where the l connects is the one memorial exactly thank you for no i mean there were either still the 90 pokestops yes i i don't know i was on my bike my little pokeball plus was spinning pokestops for me the giant memorial is the civil war memorial what you can't see because they're really well hidden because i was whizzing by on my bike there are plaques in the ground and originally somebody so this is the this is the history of victory mario parkway when it was ingress somebody went through and did all 157 plaques as stops which wasn't a problem for ingress then pokemon go hit and that was the place to go because in a three mile area there's a 157 stops but if you also notice that there's roads on both sides and neighbors so people were just slowly driving up and down that three mile mark oh you've got to be kidding me so last year finally the neighbors all had enough and so they complained to niantic and the antics solution was to drop it from 157 to 90. so it's still good when it's warm you still can't like you have to get really close to the ground to see the the plaques of all the dead people well i guess so yeah but the only one that's big and above ground is the one that's the l which is the civil war one but all along those ways you have like i have actively searched to try to find them and you have to like almost be on top of them to see the little square grave marker that says here is here is william he died in a war it's very set off but it is still if it's warm 90 poke stops in the three mile in the three mile walk and you can walk up and down it and never run out of pokestops it's just the neighbors get really bad especially in winter because people drive slow and don't pull over and it blocks traffic so people don't do that when it's cold anymore really i may go there on the next community day on my bike we'll see well speaking of community day we have some community community day news we have some tcg news this episode we have some uh anime news not a lot happening in sword and shield although the players cup 2 finals was this weekend as we're recording i don't think the final match has been concluded but what i can conclude is whatever wins that final match will be the new meta going forward in competitive aren't there new max raids for this month yeah it's just the lapras and the center scorch nothing too exciting i a great i need to get that gigantic center scorch i need that they're everywhere uh let's uh let's start with the pokemon go news [Music] they did announce community day stuff this is the third year they've done this like the throwback where it's like you missed it so here it comes again this is going to be a two-day event on december 12th and december uh 13th it'll start at 6am uh to 10pm local time which i think is new i think before it started at like eight so they're starting a little early six a.m i'm sure somebody's getting up at six and they're doing the entire thing i'm positive those people exist look i've got to catch 200 pokemon in one day so that's a good motivation for sure i'm hoping i'm not i'm already on the i'm hating pokemon go train right now so oh because you're still grinding that 40. it is everything everything that i hate about pokemon go is magnified trying to do this grind how many raids are you doing today none that's though that's the xp though greg okay you gotta at least do your free raids i can barely find people online to open my gifts we have a slack and a discord we have both they're active at different times so then i have to like and this is the thing this is what actively makes me hate this game so then i have to try to coordinate with whoever might be online and then wait for them to get done or like yesterday with steve oh i'm ready oh no i'm catching something i'll be ready in four minutes oh no it ended early now i'm ready okay no wait i still have to go madness usually i'm happiness usually i'm relatively good that was a weird situation sure sure sure okay then i have to deal with the stupid lag of the of the notifications in go when people say i've sent it to you and i'm like you did and then with 10 seconds to go it pops up i'm like oh it finally showed up and then i jump in you got to upgrade your phone you got to get new phones so faster faster loads pokemon appearing more in the wild charmander weedle abra

will get your gyarados hat i've seen the picture of it which made me want it even less uh it's it's fine you get the badge though you get a medallion yeah that nobody looks at it's true but you also have played plenty of world of warcraft and final fantasy and gotten things that no one ever sees not true i get mounts people see me on the mounts when i come swooping in on my t-rex when i come scoring down out of the sky people are like are you flying in the back of a t-rex and i will say yes did you get that uh whale yes i am here i'll just go for you 25 bucks for that every time in the future if the future happens that we are all at brunch together steve we will start brunch by launching pokemon go and showing each other our level 40 medallions level 40s so that it will have meaning and purpose i'm showing up too late at so i do do you want an update of where i'm at because when it last week didn't remember what what my xp was no i was at 200 000 xp into level 39 i'm at right now as of this recording one million five hundred and eighty three thousand and eighty eight out of five five million needed one point five out of five million yep that's not bad you'll get there yeah you can do it how about this i'll come up for community day we'll go to mall of america i am not going into the death mall oh yeah i wouldn't go into mall of america either uh trust me i was there on monday this past monday i was one of six total shoppers in the entirety of the mall that place is probably the safest place on earth to be right now interesting you can keep 30 feet of space like between you and every other person there i was at mayfair mall yesterday and it was pretty pretty bustling but maybe it was maybe it feels busy because at least at mayfair they most stores only allow a certain amount of people in so it results in lines of people outside the store no minnesotan goes to mall of america unless they're close to it because there's eight million malls here that actually have things we need so when franklin is down mall of america has nothing there's nothing involved america that i think oh only mall of america has that and the things that it only has are literally things i don't need in my life right like why would a local person go to mall of america where they charge two dollars minimum extra on everything because it's it's a tourist thing so if you're not getting tourists then yeah it would be empty but because it's empty it makes doing raids and stuff that you could count on in mall of america that much harder yeah but if there was like if like you and will decided to go to mall america because it's heated because maybe on those days it'll be empty it's not heated it's not then they don't have a heating system the two of you would be able to invite probably one to two people and you could do any rate you want valid how am i going to invite you you're gonna fight me i'm doing raids oh i mean remote raids i'm sorry that's not a world i live in oh my gosh you get the free raid passes you you both log in you both can invite up to five people i do and they don't show up granted i don't warn them and it's only an esper yeah oh speaking of that uh pokemon first discovered in the kalos region are here uh chespin fennekin froakie bunnelby fletchling lit leo and noibat are in the wild i guess they decided to make noibat the rare one this is i'm not i've seen that i'm not i'm never surprised like i was surprised when they made marie so rare i was like huh maureep interesting and they they they take certain pokemon and they make them rare for whatever reason it's fine but out of all the pokemon i i maybe i think i i expected lit leo to be more rare but literally i was like the b doof of the game yeah but lit leo is i mean thinking it's the squirrel isn't it no it's a lion it's a lion but it's like the it's the normal type the grout one cheesy garbage is he wrote no he's like route five he's route he's route to the side of the first town his route one's bundle b and i'm already seeing enough bomb noibat is the rare one no that's not yeah no i mean there's no game more noibats rare i mean like noibat is in the first cave of the first trial of sun and moon and ultrasound ultra moon and obviously didn't debut in that game but you get them relatively not late in x and y it took me a very long time to find a froakie and i'm not happy about that bennikin is like non-stop spawning in my house yeah i got tons of fennec but like we are literally a million lakes i should have froakie abundance and i have none i have one geography you live on the side of town where there's not lakes because you live up there i'm down here with lake after lake after lake we do live at the top of the river valley that is true but there's a giant river very close to my house froakies don't like rivers it wouldn't surprise me if uh frokey was the rarest of the three because greninja is so popular i mean fennekin's cuter not when it evolves oh lies you like delphox i think it's okay i love gelfox it's okay like better than greninja with a tongue remember when we went to the world tournament last year and they had dell fox plushes and greninja plushes but they didn't even bother to bring just not lunches it's because somebody bought them all out yeah lover 101 was like yum yum yum yum okay i don't think this show has enough hot takes i brought one this week i'm not ready but do it anyways we need like a hot take uh spice alerts spice alerts spice alerts this is a real says steve's about to say something these kind of dumb people exactly no no no i think you guys will agree these pokemon go fans that that complained left and right on social media on the reddits on the twitters these people complained about mega evolution being a scam being a rip-off being not worth their dollars and these are the still true these are the same people who bragged about doing 30 esper raids so they could get to level 41. they refused and whined all the way to the farm is that an expression that no mega evolution was a ripoff but they still is they just dropped 30 to do as many espers as they could so they could get to level 41. it is hmm hey how is that a hot take and how is that just not you complaining i mean i'm complaining about the people complaining because it's hypocritical hypocritical why is it hypocritical to be like i don't want to spend a dollar on mega evolution but they'll spend a dollar on esper just to get to level 41 the money it was about the fact that mega evolution was too short they get they you get to keep every asper that you can keep everyone is forever and you have to keep re-evolving your so means you have to do those mega raids they are different things i can't tell if you're sliding with them just to play devil's at the kid are you exciting with them dude i've got to be the first to level 50. otherwise i'm i don't know it's just like why do you have to be the first at level 50 because because i have no other meaning in my life there you go fair i i don't think they're the same but go you do your hot take spicy space i think the rewards you get from mega evolution are worth the the rare candy the tms all that stuff is worth the dollar compared to the nothing you get from esper because the one star raid i mean if people want to spend 30 dollars to get to level i mean their people did spend 30 dollars to get to 41 in a day i will spend at most at this point five dollars to maybe get to 40. well i have like i have i still have no problem spending a dollar to do a mega raid if you got the mega obama snow i'm interested because i think they're fun and i want that candy and i want to make it evolve so when i do a raid it saves me more time last bit of go news here uh this was a i would probably say that's a pretty big deal this is pokemon.com pokemon the movie secrets of the jungle and pokemon go collide pokemon go trainers can participate in themed research and encounter uh encounter feature pokemon and more pokemon the movie secrets of the jungle will release in 2021 but you won't have to wait you won't have to wait to meet some characters featured in the movie because a themed pokemon go event is kicking off on december 14th special research guided by none other than jesse and james themselves completing the research will earn you a encounter with a shiny celebi one of the pokemon prominently featured in pokemon the movie secrets of the jungle you may also run into jesse and james in either go snapshot or in the meow or in their iconic meowth balloon and avatar i uh items inspired by the troublesome duo will be available in the game shop wait so they were out of pokemon go for a total of one month yep um no they two months [Laughter] [Music] you can't keep you can't keep a good pair down they made such an a thing about jesse and james are leaving make sure that you if you see their balloon that you get up in there and everything and for two months hey two months is a lot of time in pokemon go people have already stopped complaining about mega evolution you are correct you are correct i just do we know do we know what do we know what the what they're out are there outfits as we look at the team rocket outfits that are already existing in the shop but just in white are they actually going to be i think we know what their outfits look like this special research will start on december 14th it's a limited time research completes it to get the shiny celebi at the end i don't see why you wouldn't be able to send the shiny celebi to home since you can send regular celebita home they will appear in the meowth there will be an explore pikachu that makes and makes it its debut uh from monday december 14th through december 21st explorer pikachu will appear in the wild and raids if you're lucky you may encounter a shiny explorer pikachu is it just going to wear a hat i hate tone is it just wearing a pith hat because probably during the pokemon spotlight hour on tuesday from six to seven explorer pikachu will be more in the wild double candy pokemon connected to the movie secrets of the jungle from monday to the 14th through thursday december 17th hoot nuzzleleaf drillburn cottony dwell spoilers all these pokemon are clearly in this movie and what more will be uh appearing in the wild if you're lucky you may get get a shiny durant like a tongue maul flygon rufflet will be appearing in raid battles this is the first time not gbl not reward related that you'll get roughly i think unless they put them in eggs and i forgot iggly buff smoochim ella kid magby bond sly and rufflet will be hatching from 5k eggs if you're lucky trainers you may find a shiny rufflet and jesse and james's meowth balloon will go until we'll be appearing more frequently on christmas which is when the movie debuts in japan from 8 a.m to 10 p.m local time balloon the boy i was gonna say you'll be able to ignore your family by doing the jesse and james balloon but that's assuming that you are seeing your family for christmas which probably most people shouldn't i am not and should stay at home it's a cool event i'm glad they're doing stuff like that it'd be nice if pokemon masters also does something of the sort well they kind of did earlier the year before the movie got delayed they had something planned yeah they did but it'd be nice to see a little bonus thing especially around the holidays they showed off erica and skyla i don't think they revealed their pokemon yet for holidays and pairs no not that i remember seeing okay um so i guess we'll talk about that when they do get debuted have you done the buffet battle thing i've not no i think we'll have more masters news to talk about next week i mean there's nothing it's boring the buffet battle is not that interesting yeah uh the first time ever since masters debuted it dropped out of the top 100 top grossing games in the japanese app store which is uh i don't know good something [Laughter] interesting those westerners are sitting on 2 000 skip tickets and no stamina are wondering what are you going to do i think we'll have a bunch of master news to talk about next week so we'll save it we'll save it for them until let's take a break and then we have uh we have some we we teased this last week but there's uh some tcg drama and i know greg tcg drama i know greg has thoughts on this i do uh so we will be right back [Music] i mean as those of us born in the 70s say you know that shiny and a coupon will get you a discount [Music] is [Music] this is we are back from our break all right tcg stuff let's start with the easy stuff here pokemon tcg gallery sidekick premium collection apparently it launched on november 20th uh do wait did we talk about this one i think we did no i don't think so the last thing i remembered is like a champion's path and vivid voltage yeah what's sidekick um it's a galar sidekick premium collection includes really boom is that the one where i get the marny play mat no that's the marnie champion's path thing really boom v cinder sv intellion v unleash your chew true champion strength it will feature oversized coin with grookie sable score bunny you will get 11 tcg booster packs for your deck what's a sidekick dangler uh that is your cell phone it's a keychain oh okay they did the same thing with the small but mighty where you had like a jiggly puff or an iggly buff cliff cleffa and uh smoocham i think igly buff club are they keychains are they like cellphone charms no they're they're bigger they're keychains they're probably half the size of a cell phone bang that is available the other thing is okay so there's a lot of hype around a set called shining star v which is available in japan and i think they make korean taiwanese sets too anyways there's not an english set shining star v is the newest set in japan it is their one of japan's biggest sets ever has 300 cards in that set how many of them are charizards probably at least 100 of the 300 uh and by the name shiny star v it features a lot of shiny pokemon in the set and all of those packs have the phantom challenge code cards in them i did a youtube video of how to do the phantom challenge and how to sign up for it and how to register for it shout out to andrew for helping me translate some of that stuff but ultimately the phantom challenge is it's not new to japan they do this all the time we just don't hear about a lot of it because it's usually for like a chancey or something but in this case the phantom challenge is for mars shadow genesect and volcanion and there's only been one volcanion and one marshall distribution in the united states so far so obviously those two pokemon are pretty sought after they do these distributions all the time in japan so maybe not a sought after but what the pokemon company likes to do is they like to partner with companies like mr donut or like 7-eleven or oh gosh what's that big department store anyways and when you buy stuff there you get points you redeem the points then you cash in those points for mythical pokemon or other things chances stuff like that the the importance is that shiny star v has the code cards inside so if you import shiny star v you can redeem the code cards right away because you need 30 points to get everything in the phantom challenge and each code card each pack of shiny star v has four points and there's 10 points in a pack basic math 40 points gets you everything now in japan you can buy any other booster pack like their vivid voltage their darkness ablaze their space set sword and shield obviously their names are a little different but you have to buy them at a pokemon center and then they give you the points because those sets have already been created so they haven't had they didn't have time to put the code cards in but plush's cards um figures they all qualify for points for the phantom challenge but if you were to import you know older cards you're not going to get the points because you have to buy them specifically at a pokemon center shiny star v is the exception to that but now fast forward to like three days ago the pokemon company announced that shining fates is a expansion that will be coming out on february 19th which is a couple days before their 25th anniversary it will feature 190 cards 100 of those will be shiny they will not be sold separately they will be sold in special collections just like champion's path just like hidden fates just like shining legends really creative name here so i wouldn't be surprised normally we get one special set a year this past year was champion's path the year before that was hidden fates i wouldn't be surprised if we get two or three special sets going into the 25th anniversary since we're already getting one in february but what this is actually going to do though is cause the price of shiny v star to drop because normally japanese cards are only worth a lot of money when there's not an english counterpart and there were people that didn't believe that shiny v star was going to come to the united states but it is as of now uh so if you want to import shiny the for the codes and because you want to collect cards you're going to look you're looking at about a hundred dollars to do that on ebay or on um import sites shiny star v in japan is about 6 000 yen i believe which is about 50 bucks which makes sense because oh gosh this is a lot more explaining than i'm used to a booster box in japan is 30 packs and in those packs are five cards each because japan booster japanese booster packs are five cards in a pack where english packs are 10 cards so normally their booster box is around like 4 000 yen but these shiny star v are 6 000 yen but you're guaranteed a hollow or better in every pack and their packs have 10 cards so that's why this special set in japan is a little bit more money so if you do decide to import it you will be paying almost double what it costs in japan but you do get the cards for the phantom challenge you can just go to ebay and buy the cards for significantly less which i think is what greg did so it's totally up to you but if you are buying my only advice is if you're buying shiny star v for resale value of reselling the cards the american pokemon company just threw a wrench in that because english cards always almost always there are exceptions but almost always will result better and for more money than japanese cards we're done with that conversation now well i i don't have any questions but now i finally understand what that like 30 back and forth message text message conversation that when i was trying to ride my bike and i kept getting interrupted was all about thank you yeah and i thought i was buying codes for the japanese website i didn't yeah well you didn't mess it up per se you just mess it up per se i just cut out having to use the website right so i did a youtube video uh how to do the phantom challenge which is one of the best youtube videos i think i put it it is like literally the second best youtube video i put out this year so thank you to i guess people really liked it by the way we're trying to get to 10 000 youtube subs before the end of the year and i think we're at like 8 000 now which is awesome maybe we can get there if you haven't subbed or gone over to the youtube now is the reason to but pretty much what happens in the phantom challenge is you gotta scan these code cards into this website run by the pokemon company and then once you get enough points you hit like redeem prize and then it it gives you a code that you can redeem on your nintendo switch what greg ended up buying from my understanding is the finalized code so somebody redeemed the points for you you just ended up buying the code yes which is very confusing because i searched for the exact same thing you said in the video i watched the video to the end and then i ordered it from the person that you had mentioned in the video it looked to save and then i got them and i'm trying to put them into the website and i'm like they're not being accepted and then i read the email closely and how it was broken down i'm like oh these are codes that actually have to enter into my switch these are the final product that makes this a whole lot easier i wonder it's more work for the seller to do that because they have to go to the web so they have to make an account because you can only do it once per account so if they're selling multiples of these they have to make multiple accounts with multiple emails because you have to verify the email which is what i show in the video and then they have to punch in the numbers for the codes to then get the switch codes it's very confusing that's why i made a video about it so it's more work for them but i wonder if they can charge more because some people just don't want to do that middle step i just explained i mean yeah but was it expensive no i mean i paid less than what you should in the video yeah yeah like what i did in the video is i just well i didn't want to like single out a seller but i also wanted to recommend a seller that i know that was safe but i didn't want to be like i didn't want anyone to think like oh steve has like a deal with this dude that's why he's recommending it's like no i just i just did a quick search i definitely recognized that name that i bought and stuff from that dude before so i can at least vouch that this dude provides like it's not a scam but also like there is no partnership it's just i've ordered from this dude before but i i knew for sure that you could find cheaper if you looked a little harder so that was kind of what i was um leading so basically what happened was uh the dude recognized greg's name and was like oh celebrity i gotta get special treatment yeah i mean i'm into that i also think though because next year is the 25th anniversary there will be plenty of mythicals given out i'm sure of it okay yes so here's a question steve all of them come as being from japan right okay and they have they have japanese names and then the english names under that i'm like this is weird me out of it yeah so um some if they know this is why i know this event this event specifically is never going to come to america and the reason for that is because japanese it might come to america in a way where they're like oh they're doing a volcanion distribution but they're not going to do a volcanion martial genocide distribution in like go to your local 7-eleven get a g-fuel and then get the code printed on the receipt and then go to a website and redeem it like that's never coming to america that is something they've done in japan for multiple distributions and stuff but usually if the if the pokemon name is locked to a language in this case when you redeem volcanion it will be volcanion's japanese name that means that like they had no plans for this to ever leave whereas like if you redeem zarude from a japanese movie ticket if you redeem it in english it will have in your english game it will have zarood's english name and if you redeem it in a german game it will have zarood's german name and then if you redeem it on your japanese switch it will have zuru's japanese name so that's so when you do redeem these they will have the japanese pokemon names but that's only because they were locked to it not locked the names are locked but the event is not locked to japan since switches are region locked not region locked sorry but they're still like their cherished ball pokemon with the ribbons and and everything but they're just locked to a specific id name etc it's a cool event in japan i just wanted to bring light to it and i know some people are really desperate for volcanion or or marshadow or whatnot so um anyways uh that youtube video will be i'll put in the show notes but otherwise the youtube is just pk mencast shiny fates is coming um there is still the tcg problem right now um where i walked i walked into a mire and they didn't have a single booster pack they didn't even have theme decks um the target i went to the other day has not restocked in over a month and the only thing they have is um like rebel clash elite trainer boxes which aren't the worst um and uh good old crimson invasion elite trainer boxes which no one in the entire world should ever buy we were talking about wasting money prior to the show if you want to really waste your money well crimson i would like to provide also uh clarification for our listeners that are not in a very very targeted specific section of the midwest steve did not walk into a swamp exactly he walked into an e m-e-i-j-e-r which i originally thought was pronounced may hair um it is a store similar to tar it's kind of between target and walmart and quality that's the best way i can describe i would i would agree with you 100 i would say it leans more towards the walmart it's the new kmart yeah like it's kmart quality yes between target and walmart but closer to walmart yes it's like a step up from walmart for sure yeah but the because of the current tcg fad which i feel like i should make a youtube video about explaining that more in depth cards are still really really hard to find and i think this is the pyramid scheme stuff yeah the more pyramid scheme stuff i think this is the other part to keep in mind that i didn't really think about till the other day until somebody pointed this out the fad currently of like i want to buy an old booster box and i want to pull like a dark charizard first edition which i think dark charizard first edition is like 20 a 25 000 card that is only if that charizard is graded at a psa 10 if it's not if it's psa 9 it's no longer 25 000 and that is assuming that you're getting it psa graded that day but because of the pandemic and because of current card fads in both pokemon magic yu-gi-oh etc psa is extremely backed up and if you send a dark charizard there you're not gonna see it for four to five months i believe as of this recording i'd have to double check and how fads work is that card was not that expensive months ago and it is expensive now who's to say it's going to be just as expensive in five months when you get it back assuming that it's even psa 10. so i don't know i don't know if when we get to february for shining fates which seems like a very fun set um hidden fates was probably one of the most fun sets to open if we'll even be able to find shining fates like it still feels impossible to find champions path i don't know any pokemon set that has the word shining in it i find very sus i'm i'm out okay more tcg news in a different light we're going to talk about ptcgo real quick there was the players cup 2 this weekend during the twitch stream they did give out a free zashian v for those who watched um it was 50 000 limited as of recording this podcast this morning there were still people were still redeeming them i made a graphic it's on the twitter it's on the instagram of how to redeem that you want a full art zashian v in ptcgo but this news is specific to ptc geo and these tweets came out on november 23rd i screenshotted them because i was worried they were going to get deleted i don't think they've been deleted yet but we complain a lot about ptcgo of how i think all three of us would probably play it a lot more if it worked and if it was not looking like an app from 2006 but we know that the developer for ptcgo is a company called direwolf digital and they make a bunch of other board games for pc and mac and they recently tweeted uh they okay they they were getting i guess hate tweets they were getting yelled at they're getting a lot of hate tweet and i can't remember what the specific issue in ptcgo was but people were complaining about something uh let me see if i can find the thread here uh i guess we'll just read it to give context there you go yeah twitter user says can't go ended never because of the pandemic so here's day one of me dming direwolf digital until they do the things that owner of world's most valuable ips pay them to do so they they send they take they took a screenshot of the the dm they sent i am going to uh family friendly uh advise this this message have you guys consid considered zookeeping just curious y'all seem to excel in the industry of big piles of poop [Laughter] i like that that's that's witty just a side note here before we go down this path there are real humans that that receive this on the other end of things as as much as i i think that ptcgo is is not a great app i i don't there are there are real people working on the app they have feelings yeah i mean that goes for everything on the internet that is like literally my experience with dating apps it's like uh hey did you realize i'm a real person here there are like way nicer and more constructive ways to tell people to be like better okay so i mean there's not a lot of traction here like this in itself is not newsworthy it had two retweets and six likes think it was yeah people were not i don't think this guy's like moving mountains people are not in their corner so somebody else tweets back at them they say i have a problem with being harsh on dire wolf because i assume that the pokemon company could make the changes if they wanted every game has bugs i accept that i am positive that there are some employees at the pokemon company that wants ptc geo to be as good as magic the gathering arena or lor legends of runeterra legends of rutera and i assume whoever makes the decisions don't care okay side note i'm gonna stop here i do know people who work at the pokemon company international and i do know that one of the biggest tcg people that works there is well aware that ptcgo is not great and they from what they've told me have said they are working to change that in the future okay back to the conversation direwolf digital then goes in and says thank you kieran the original tweet with the zoo joke kieran being rude to our team and sending offensive dms to our social media folks isn't helpful or fair we have a team who across the board is passionate about making products with a very high quality bar check out any of our other games that's not to say that there aren't bugs or issues that come up especially in a game as large card slash content wise as ptc geo but there always are but our studios work is often recognized as being one of the higher standards in the genre we work for generally speaking we aren't generally speaking why we were silent on getting dunked on here we cannot comment on the decisions that go into the state of some of our products as a dev who works for other large publishers we don't always get to prioritize the things we want no matter how much we lobby uh and that's pretty much it those are the three tweets they did which i feel like says a lot it says exactly the same thing that we've been saying about everything for like at least two years now no sub company no american company no niantic no dire wolf can do anything on their own right they may have to have approval first yeah i mean this is what i this is what i've been saying for you know two plus years in the show is people get mad that niantic made a molga a one-week spawn but it's like no the pokemon company did that like the reason that noibat is rare isn't because of niantic it's because the pokemon company says we need a rare pokemon and let's do know that we want we we want more hat pikachu's niantic here's the model for the next hat we thought of put it into the game like i am like i don't think niantic is sitting around like bordering with a bunch of hats on the wall throwing darts being like this is our next pikachu like this is all coming from the pokemon company if you if you still think that like oh niantic's making these decisions if you think that a free to play game like ptc ptcgo with no way to give pt cgo money is being so strictly controlled by the pokemon company but the thing that makes them the most money undoubtedly millions of dollars a month quarter after quarter of being better than the last quarter if you still think for some reason that like ah that's just niantic making you're out of your mind that the pokemon company would be like we need to strangle this board game app but hey you guys over here do what like no way well the question is like why why do they not care not not care why are there just not more resources to pcc geo why do they not want to compete at the level of magic the gathering do they even outside of the computer game world they are sitting on the same shelf as magic and yu-gi-oh well depending on so greg let me let me just jump in for it quick so my main thing that i think people easily forget and steve you just don't have as much exposure to is ptcgo has been around for what a decade is just about 10 years now yeah it launched it launched when when we kind of first met will yeah all right so eight years nine years mtg arena the actual good mtg to play online has been around for about two years yep and was very broken for the first year oh heck yeah it was and if you actually look at what wizards provided as a play interface previous to mtg arena it was horrible i mean it's still out there you can still see it it's terrible gathering and they charge you money for that it is awful it's it's it's not a fair comparison number one and number two what that makes very clear is if they wanted to make a significant improvement slash revision to pctc geo they'd have to scrap what they currently have and start fresh yep and that is just a huge mountain to get over that that would be a huge amount of investment for as you said something that does not collect money and i guarantee you if there was some way if they opened up something like a subscription pt cgo subscription or directly buy packs through ptc geo which would probably get them off of uh ipads people would they're what is the expression you their minds would explode the brains would fly out of there yeah how dare no i i i agree that like the only way at this point to save ptcgo is to start over yeah and there there were rumors that there were rumors that whoever makes magic the gathering arena i don't know who who the developer on that is there was rumors that they were making a new version of ptc joe i mean it is also possible that like could be possible that direwolf digital is working on a new version of ptc geo because the framework is so bad that they have to start over but if if the pokemon company just came out and said that and said look this app is nine years old we can't the game has changed so much since then i mean nine years ago i think at one point in the game you could give it money and then they removed it i think that was like the first six months if they want but now because of the success of pokemon masters and because of the success of pokemon go they clearly are okay with taking money especially if that money is like five dollars a week which i don't know what the average i i don't know what the average pokemon go player gives niantic or or what not but like that would i think that in itself would be a huge 25th anniversary announcement to be like hey yeah we are rolling out it won't be ready this year but we are working on a brand new worldwide version of ptcgo because remember japan doesn't have this at all and if japan is okay giving money to gotcha games they're very good at giving money to pokemon go i'm sure they would love a version of pt cgo for themselves so to like relaunch ptc whether that's next year or the year before have a way to import your card database which i can't imagine they they if they can figure out how to get a pokemon from gen 3 to gen 8 i think they can figure out how to take your cards from ptc i will tell you the magic the gathering arena does not care what cards you own in real life they are separate things you can get some specialty packs that will say hey put in these codes and you'll get this a constructed deck and you can sometimes put in codes to get packs but they don't care what you've bought outside oh ptcgo doesn't carry either yeah yeah the code you get in a pack is different than the code you get in the game so there's a couple of things that we need to keep in mind one digital occupying games came under hyper focus because of the state of the world it is very clear that pokemon company was very much in this is an in person game right yeah like your tournaments are in person with physical cards we don't use electronics then 2020 happened and there's now a huge focus on maybe these large events can never happen again it takes time to develop an entire strategy to have those two concurrent programs running to give them equal weight it took magic two years to do it they're running tournaments online and in person but they are focused on that one specific product and getting it and it still took two years to get magic the gathering arena worthwhile and there are still bugs and still problems with card interactions because magic has a 25-year history they have to get all the cards in there and they have to figure out how things from 25 years ago worked now it's the same with pct but but actually actually in mtg arena they don't have all the cards ptcgo has a larger card database than mtg arena absolutely and i mean if they've added something because they're adding in historic so some are coming in but they do have a cut off so people there is a lot like what made me angry about this tweets is when there's like this level of belief that a company just doesn't want to put out good product the one thing that gets me through most work days and dealing with anybody is that knowledge that almost everybody ninety five percent of people come in to do a good job and try their best they don't want to have public embarrassment also you have to look at this wasn't a focus this hasn't been a focus until 2020 made it be a focus and if you're expecting them to suddenly say since march oh we're going to pump 50 billion dollars into this product and get something up and working with every card from 10 years that also doesn't charge people money that fixes every issue and every card set works together you have no idea how the world works yeah well there you go i mean it's also like even if the pokemon company wanted to be like okay we're done with direwolf we need to go somewhere else like what big developer out there is going to be like oh yeah sure we're doing nothing right now let's go make this game like literally every big developer is probably a year or two years or five years into making a current game and even if they said yes you get in line because they're still working on something right like there's not a developer that's just sitting around being like man i wish somebody would drop a game in our lap yeah like that's just not how the world works and you could be like okay well then they should just do it themselves okay well hiring a manager hiring like 40 developers hiring people to get those developers isn't something you just do in a month well you don't just like oh we're just going to cross chain these five people who are already working on a product every large corporation runs as close to the minimum amount of people you need on a project to save money as they can i have i'll say this in my own life i have eight call centers call centers of 500 to a thousand people that i alone support and make training for and my team that does it worldwide is 11 people and if all of us go out on vacation at the same time everything comes to a screeching halt because there is no extra they don't pay no company pays to have people who will only have a half day full of work who are sitting around in case something is needed they figure out the exact number that they need plus people taking vacation and sick time is not included in that and say this project will take 25 people to complete so we're going to give you 27 and that's it that's the budget and that was set january 1 we will re-look it and re-evaluate january 1 of next year and see how you did but you get no more there's no more and hope none of those people quit or leave because then you have to backfill and then ramp that person up that is such a delicate balance that they get for teams to work on these things and the numbers are so tight this notion that people are just sitting around with nothing to do in the company is not how how the world works the reason why people have extra staff in retail store is the idea that you are hanging around in case somebody comes in and if it's a slow season you all know your shifts get cut it's the same except we're salary and so they keep us or fire us i think there is value in making sure or hoping i think that i like whether we get a gen 4 remake whether we get gen 9 like those those things are like going to come eventually having a brand new version of ptcgo and have it designed to be able to do these tournaments which ptc geo is failing at right now which the pokemon company tried to make happen this year and they're continuing to try to make happen because it's all they have um i think that would be just so healthy and so positive and so good for people who love the pokemon trading card game and i think it would be good to get more people into the pokemon trading card game if there was an updated fresh app it would it would benefit current players it would benefit new players it would bring them money once they establish something that is good um and it would it would cause for healthy competition and i think maybe their worry was well if we do tournaments through ptcgo we won't do tournaments i that would push away from people coming to irl tournaments and i don't think that's the case i think that if i can if i cannot travel to x event but i can do x event here and i perform well it will incentivize me to want to travel in the future um i don't think i just don't think it takes away um and i'm sure that i'm sure magic slash hearthstone whatever hearthstone sorry i'm i'm sure they have also proven that like these digital events aren't taking away from their live events well there are no live events so who knows what's going on in the world anymore but maybe that's why ptc joe has been so poorly up kept for the last like year and a half is because they've put they're putting resources into something else i want to dream i want to i want to think that you want you want the hope to be alive it's probably like i think if anything this year has proven to every company that you don't know what's going to happen and it's really good to have a great online backup last bit of news here is uh the new series of uh pokemon journeys is on netflix we finally got the way to say the dragon type gym leaders i was wrong greg was wrong but together we were right take the first part of how greg thought it was in the last part of how i thought it was i mean the only way that i was wrong is they they overly pronounce the h in the middle you were very you were like oh it's ryan and i was like i don't think so right right right sorry yeah the last part is supposed to sound like hand right hand right hand right hand right hand no d why do you keep adding a d then i know it's like because i gotta think of hand when i say it look the mps education is creeping up on me i only i only jumped to the episode just to hear his name i did not watch the episode i have not watched it yet either i have i have vacation coming up and i know what i'm doing on vacation i probably won't yeah i probably will watch it maybe christmas eve or christmas with uh with irene it's been real busy question of the week i don't want a lot from slack there is just one thing i need posted in the attic channel it's the question of the week look i am trying to get mariah out of christmas nope but it is time and it will happen to andy and stuart who sent in some new stuff we will get to that stuff next week just uh wanted to focus on the tcg stuff this week this is from andrew which pokemon would look bet which pokemon would look better in machoke machamp line pants design pants i don't think it is no it's got a belt machamp's got the belt are they saying that they want pants on machoke i think the only pokemon wearing pants is scraggy i mean so oh giganta max machamp has pants it does where's he get pants from when he giganta maxes it's like how the hulk rips his shirt off machamp the pants on put his shirt on according to official japanese website machokima champ don't wear pants and then what is that what is the lion pant is that that what could you read the question again please which pokemon would look better in machoke machamp line pants so i okay let's break those which pokemon look better in the machoque champ line line okay let's put the emphasis and spacing in there right hands well look there was no comma but they've got no pants so which which pokemon will look which would look better in a pair of speedos oh is that what it's asking that's what i'm saying it is so you like like take the speedo slash weight lifting belt lifting belt off the machine and then put it on like a pikachu not not on a pikachu because that would be terrible i you could you put on a hitmonlee you could you put on a glade but the guy's got that weird cape thing cape what's got also the weird belty middle like round disc in the middle that i don't really ever understand i want to find a way to reject this question completely and since i have recently discovered that i'm the queen of france i'm just going to say klefki klefke should be wearing a speedo there you go okay uh blaziken would probably look okay in the uh speedo slash belt meta needs a speedo and a belt a lich is a true champion i wonder how they're going to do halluci in pokemon go they're not this is another keklyan disaster wait what's the issue why can't they just have hot lucha and pokemon go yeah well i don't think there's any issue there the issue it doesn't evolve signature move it is quickly no the issue with keklian is like it would have to if you're it would have to copy the type in like the raid like mechanically it wouldn't work mechanically they would have make that work because keklian is normal type but if he's attacking like a kirum then he becomes i ice type ice type no i thought kecleon changed baseball on what move it move it wait move it it's it's getting hit by yeah hit by so if kiram's using ice moves it would turn ice which would then have to change its moves so that's the problem all right i have my final answer but i have the final answer about my pants oh no it's moves would be the same it's yeah it's just it's type of change yeah type of change yeah which is like changing super effective to not super effective yeah but it would never it would never get stabbed unless it somehow changes to a normal type anyways i'm putting a a bling belt and speedos on my sable eye final answer okay i'll give it to you i will give it to you you got it pokemon of the week well all right last week's pokemon super easy was based on trading card game cards uh only available in sword and sealed shield expansion there were actually two cards number 73 and 74. but in the japanese sets it's actually been available in four different sets technically both cards have 70 hp one has attacks that are bite and zap kick the other one has roar and static shock and uh it is a herding dog in the gala region as it runs it generates electricity from the base of its tail there you go greg cause i steve's completely confused right now it's pikachu it's the better pikachu it's yamper and this is so i can get my ball back yeah got a ball fetch yeah it's got that ball pitch yes and and you know they held off on printing any pikachu cards in the tcg until sorted [Laughter] did you know that his name may be a combination of a yam of yap ampere and scamper oh i like that i did not know that i like that its hidden ability is rattled it make it looks very thematic what does rattles do uh rattle is like it alerts you if there's a super effective move right no that's anticipation oh yeah yeah when a pokemon with the ability hits a bug dark ghost type speed will be increased by one stage uh with if the pokemon with this ability is hit by a bug ghost dark multi move it each will activate the ability and then generation 8 uh it is now activated by intimidate i actually didn't know that what yeah that was rattled a lot of people uh obviously uh dunsparce oh actually no i was like none of these pokemon matter like like alolan persian knows rattle but he would never run it because a little persian is already so fast pseudo-widow i guess but sudowoodo is really bad it's clam pearl no rattled it's it's hidden ability because it gets scared and hides in its shell and speeds up yeah i guess shiny does yeah it's really bad yeah i'm not a huge fan of what colors is it it's like instead of like being yellow it's like yellow pink yeah it's like it's just like a little bit lighter it's it's hard to see yeah because he's like tan yeah but his like shiny is like beige-ish it's like really hard to tell i had no shuffle icon unfortunately no no shuffle icon yet 25th anniversary coming though yeah exactly i'm very excited for this all right this week's pokemon it's gonna be a wild ride here we go in some ways it is amazing to scroll through the pokedex and see how many pokemon i have already covered as pokemon of the week in other ways it is quite distressing as they aren't churning out new pokemon in as much quantity as they used to i am feeling either get good scrubs or quit now for odds sometimes i like to pick a pokemon with either unique or very limited typing did you know that ice type has the fewest number of pokemon available they've pretty much run out of ice types though this week i'll do something more common but not as common as say water types the main thing that caught my eye about this week's pokemon wasn't that it can evolve into two pokemon simultaneously and it may be the only pokemon that can do this but that its main evolution the one it always evolves into has opposite typing from it i don't mean opposites like ice and fire but more opposites like this week's pokemon has stabbed for moves that would not hit its evolution at all we have another unique fact that both pokemon this week's evolves this week's evolves into do not inherit either of its possible abilities i guess in the end it's not slacking clan pearl there you go yeah yes clan pearl exactly because uh huntail and bra fish don't get rattled goribus don't have uh what is it uh shudder not shutter uh rattled rattled rattled all right well that's our episode uh wait i have a news update for everybody before you do the closing okay i have watched the my neighbor totoro dvd that movie is not good lies and i'm sending it back to netflix after a decade it's going back to netflix and then are you canceling your dvd yeah what's what's next i think i have some episodes of doctor who oh you need and i'm talking like the old doctor who not the not the 2000s doctor who i was actually i think the problem with totoro is people hype it up and then you watch it and you're like wow nothing happens exactly and then they're like look i've seen slice of life and they may have killed a little girl in it you don't know true slightly the ending is is is lovingly ambiguous yes i started re-watching death note so good that is a good anime yeah anyway did you ever finish brotherhood yeah i've watched brotherhood always okay this is me and anime like irene was like irene for it took her like three years to convince me to watch fullmetal because i was like the only anime in my life is digimon um and i watched fullmetal and i was like okay this is good i watched it all the way through and then i was like this ending to full metal is gonna be so bad and i'm gonna waste how many episodes of that and i'm gonna hate it and it had one of the best endings in any tv show i've ever seen and then she was like you need to watch death note now and i was like nah and i watched death note it was also good not as good as full metal but now she's like you should watch my hero and i was like is it better heck yeah is it better than full metal she's like it's different i was like why would i watch something really is different so my hero is more modern is is that and it has obviously a full metal alchemist is a 15 year old intellectual property um but yeah my hero is my hero hasn't ended so you're not going to get an ending yet okay so i will not watch it i i need an ending what you watch it as it comes out because i have to watch okay so this is the other thing is i have to watch it in english and before anyone says well these licenses are better i don't care who's japanese or english voices better i'm not judging anyone on performance here i will say that my hero dub is good i am watching those i have to read like 18 hours a day twitch chat and that's a lot of garbage i gotta hurry so when i'm done reading twitch chat i do not want to sit on my couch and put my feet up and i have a cat in my lap and do more reading i just i'm i'm i'm brain dead at that point and i just want to watch i want to consume i don't want to read i just want to veg out in the very few moments i have in life to watch tv all right well then i guess you need to watch uh attack on titan is it is that over or do we still have one more season i think there's one more season look i only made it through season one and i couldn't do season two and i have not kept up oh it gets so much better that's the one that i think i'm gonna wait until it's done and then just binge it i need stuff to be done but why would i watch something new and i could just re-watch full metal because it's new i don't know i like i don't know full metal true i'm not watching the other full metal i looked at the ending and i was like that ending is bad i like already that drew convinced me to watch the newest naruto knockoff and i'm i'm still deciding if if this uh anime is worth it hard pass all right close out the program okay
