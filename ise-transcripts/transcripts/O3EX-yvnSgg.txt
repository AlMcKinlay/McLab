[Music] (0:01 - 0:28)
what's up everyone welcome to the 438th (0:25 - 0:31)
episode of the pokemon podcast it's (0:28 - 0:33)
super effective i'm your host (0:31 - 0:36)
sbj with me is will internet scam alert (0:33 - 0:38)
this uh podcast is (0:36 - 0:41)
internet now (0:38 - 0:44)
i i i had two things to say but i'm (0:41 - 0:46)
going to leave it at one (0:44 - 0:48)
recently purchased trx are you familiar (0:46 - 0:50)
with trx (0:48 - 0:52)
is that a graphics card no it's a (0:50 - 0:54)
clanging and banging thing (0:52 - 0:56)
except that you don't clang and bang (0:54 - 0:57)
it's literally (0:56 - 1:00)
a canvas strap with handles at either (0:57 - 1:02)
end that you hang from your door frame (1:00 - 1:06)
or from the ceiling so you can do (1:02 - 1:08)
exercise bodyweight exercises when your (1:06 - 1:10)
gym is closed (1:08 - 1:13)
why did that cost me 200 dollars (1:10 - 1:17)
wow a canvas strap (1:13 - 1:20)
with handles at the end why the answer (1:17 - 1:21)
is they're taking advantage of my (1:20 - 1:23)
desperation and my (1:21 - 1:25)
shrinking muscles doesn't your seven (1:23 - 1:26)
million dollar (1:25 - 1:29)
a month a fancy apartment complex have (1:26 - 1:33)
its own gym okay closed do i need to (1:29 - 1:34)
post (1:33 - 1:37)
more screen caps of the facebook group (1:34 - 1:39)
for my seven million dollar a month (1:37 - 1:40)
fancy apartment (1:39 - 1:43)
building i want nothing to do with these (1:40 - 1:44)
people (1:43 - 1:46)
the faster i can get out of here the (1:44 - 1:47)
better (1:46 - 1:50)
all right greg also here i am here (1:47 - 1:54)
i spent 60 dollars on resistance bands (1:50 - 1:57)
and they're quite nice what happened to (1:54 - 1:59)
ring fit adventure (1:57 - 2:02)
i do rings and adventure on the non (1:59 - 2:04)
muscle building days because ring fit (2:02 - 2:06)
adventure is mostly (2:04 - 2:09)
calisthenics and some some (2:06 - 2:12)
toning but the resistance bands are (2:09 - 2:13)
actually muscling build (2:12 - 2:15)
muscle muscle builder exercises like (2:13 - 2:17)
just have the resistant bands on (2:15 - 2:20)
while you do ring fit no a (2:17 - 2:22)
because bring fit asked me to do a whole (2:20 - 2:24)
bunch of stuff that doesn't make a whole (2:22 - 2:26)
lot of sense (2:24 - 2:29)
and b you need to focus (2:26 - 2:31)
full body workout then cardio workout (2:29 - 2:32)
full body workout then cardio workout i (2:31 - 2:37)
mean i am level 57 (2:32 - 2:37)
why would you slack off dude ring finish (2:39 - 2:42)
choice (2:42 - 2:44)
i think i think i stopped at 55. what (2:42 - 2:47)
where are you in bro (2:44 - 2:49)
i got through the one where you had to (2:47 - 2:51)
do the elite four (2:49 - 2:53)
oh yeah that was two worlds ago oh yeah (2:51 - 2:55)
i'm the world after the elite four (2:53 - 2:58)
wait speaking of misinformation that (2:55 - 2:59)
comes from greg (2:58 - 3:03)
oh here we go i so you know now once (2:59 - 3:05)
again compensating for my lack of access (3:03 - 3:06)
to (3:05 - 3:09)
gym facilities on saturdays i try to go (3:06 - 3:12)
about 30 miles on my bike so yesterday (3:09 - 3:15)
i was like greg back in the days when (3:12 - 3:17)
pokemon go was a game that you played (3:15 - 3:18)
out of doors (3:17 - 3:22)
used to speak about this mystical place (3:18 - 3:24)
where he would go on community days (3:22 - 3:26)
called victory memorial park because (3:24 - 3:29)
all of the memorials were poke stops (3:26 - 3:31)
yeah (3:29 - 3:34)
dude i went there yesterday i biked (3:31 - 3:38)
the east west and north south legs of (3:34 - 3:39)
that entire park (3:38 - 3:41)
there was one memorial you're fibbing (3:39 - 3:42)
what there's (3:41 - 3:44)
only one memorial in the entirety of (3:42 - 3:46)
victory memorial park it's (3:44 - 3:49)
right at the l it's like an l of grass (3:46 - 3:51)
and where the l connects is the one (3:49 - 3:52)
memorial (3:51 - 3:56)
exactly thank you for no i mean (3:52 - 3:58)
there were either still the 90 pokestops (3:56 - 3:59)
yes (3:58 - 4:01)
i i don't know i was on my bike my (3:59 - 4:03)
little pokeball plus was spinning (4:01 - 4:04)
pokestops for me (4:03 - 4:07)
the giant memorial is the civil war (4:04 - 4:08)
memorial (4:07 - 4:11)
what you can't see because they're (4:08 - 4:13)
really well hidden (4:11 - 4:15)
because i was whizzing by on my bike (4:13 - 4:17)
there are plaques in the ground (4:15 - 4:20)
and originally somebody so this is the (4:17 - 4:21)
this is the history of victory mario (4:20 - 4:23)
parkway when it was ingress (4:21 - 4:26)
somebody went through and did all 157 (4:23 - 4:29)
plaques as stops which wasn't a problem (4:26 - 4:31)
for ingress (4:29 - 4:33)
then pokemon go hit and that was the (4:31 - 4:34)
place to go because (4:33 - 4:39)
in a three mile area there's a 157 stops (4:34 - 4:41)
but if you also notice that there's (4:39 - 4:42)
roads on both sides and (4:41 - 4:45)
neighbors so people were just slowly (4:42 - 4:45)
driving (4:45 - 4:48)
up and down that three mile mark oh (4:45 - 4:49)
you've got to be (4:48 - 4:52)
kidding me so last year (4:49 - 4:55)
finally the neighbors all had enough and (4:52 - 4:56)
so they complained (4:55 - 4:58)
to niantic and the antics solution was (4:56 - 5:01)
to drop it from 157 (4:58 - 5:06)
to 90. so it's still good when it's warm (5:01 - 5:07)
you still can't like you have to get (5:06 - 5:09)
really close to the ground to see the (5:07 - 5:11)
the plaques of all the dead people well (5:09 - 5:13)
i guess so yeah (5:11 - 5:15)
but the only one that's big and above (5:13 - 5:17)
ground is the one that's the (5:15 - 5:20)
l which is the civil war one but all (5:17 - 5:21)
along those ways you have like (5:20 - 5:23)
i have actively searched to try to find (5:21 - 5:25)
them and you have to like (5:23 - 5:26)
almost be on top of them to see the (5:25 - 5:29)
little square grave marker (5:26 - 5:32)
that says here is here is william he (5:29 - 5:33)
died in a war (5:32 - 5:36)
it's very set off but it is still (5:33 - 5:40)
if it's warm 90 poke stops in the three (5:36 - 5:41)
mile (5:40 - 5:42)
in the three mile walk and you can walk (5:41 - 5:44)
up and down it and never run out of (5:42 - 5:45)
pokestops (5:44 - 5:46)
it's just the neighbors get really bad (5:45 - 5:48)
especially in winter because people (5:46 - 5:48)
drive (5:48 - 5:51)
slow and don't pull over and it blocks (5:48 - 5:52)
traffic (5:51 - 5:53)
so people don't do that when it's cold (5:52 - 5:55)
anymore really i may go there on the (5:53 - 5:57)
next community day on my bike (5:55 - 6:00)
we'll see well speaking of community day (5:57 - 6:02)
we have some community community day (6:00 - 6:05)
news we have some tcg news this episode (6:02 - 6:08)

happening in sword and shield although (6:08 - 6:11)
the players cup (6:10 - 6:14)
2 finals was this weekend as we're (6:11 - 6:16)
recording i don't think the final match (6:14 - 6:16)
has (6:16 - 6:19)
been concluded but what i can conclude (6:16 - 6:21)
is whatever wins that final match will (6:19 - 6:22)
be the (6:21 - 6:26)
new meta going forward in competitive (6:22 - 6:28)
aren't there new max raids for this (6:26 - 6:30)

center scorch i need that they're (6:35 - 6:38)
everywhere (6:38 - 6:40)
uh let's uh let's start with the pokemon (6:38 - 6:41)
go news (6:40 - 6:42)
[Music] (6:41 - 6:44)
they did announce community day stuff (6:42 - 6:46)
this is the third year they've done this (6:44 - 6:47)
like the throwback where it's like you (6:46 - 6:49)
missed it so here it comes again (6:47 - 6:51)
this is going to be a two-day event on (6:49 - 6:52)
december 12th and (6:51 - 6:56)
december uh 13th it'll start at 6am (6:52 - 6:59)
uh to 10pm local time which i think is (6:56 - 7:00)
new i think before it started at like (6:59 - 7:01)
eight (7:00 - 7:03)
so they're starting a little early six (7:01 - 7:05)
a.m i'm sure somebody's getting up at (7:03 - 7:06)
six and they're doing the entire thing (7:05 - 7:07)
i'm (7:06 - 7:09)
positive those people exist look i've (7:07 - 7:11)
got to catch 200 pokemon in one day (7:09 - 7:15)
so that's a good motivation for sure (7:11 - 7:19)
i'm hoping i'm not i'm already on the (7:15 - 7:21)
i'm hating pokemon go train right now so (7:19 - 7:22)
oh because you're still grinding that (7:21 - 7:25)
40. it is (7:22 - 7:25)
everything everything that i hate about (7:26 - 7:31)
pokemon go is magnified trying to do (7:28 - 7:32)
this grind (7:31 - 7:34)
how many raids are you doing today none (7:32 - 7:37)
that's though that's the xp though greg (7:34 - 7:38)
okay you gotta at least do your free (7:37 - 7:40)
raids i can barely (7:38 - 7:44)
find people online to open my gifts (7:40 - 7:47)
we have a slack and a discord we have (7:44 - 7:48)
both (7:47 - 7:51)
they're active at different times so (7:48 - 7:52)
then i have to like (7:51 - 7:54)
and this is the thing this is what (7:52 - 7:55)
actively makes me hate this game so then (7:54 - 7:57)
i have to try to coordinate with (7:55 - 7:59)
whoever might be online and then wait (7:57 - 8:00)
for them to get done or like yesterday (7:59 - 8:01)
with steve (8:00 - 8:03)

pokemon go and showing each other (12:06 - 12:13)
our level 40 medallions level 40s (12:09 - 12:17)
so that it will have meaning and purpose (12:13 - 12:20)
i'm showing up too late at so i do (12:17 - 12:22)
do you want an update of where i'm at (12:20 - 12:24)
because when it last week (12:22 - 12:28)
didn't remember what what my xp was no (12:24 - 12:32)
i was at 200 000 xp into (12:28 - 12:36)
level 39 i'm at right now (12:32 - 12:39)
as of this recording one million five (12:36 - 12:41)
hundred and eighty three thousand (12:39 - 12:43)
and eighty eight out of five five (12:41 - 12:45)
million needed (12:43 - 12:48)
one point five out of five million yep (12:45 - 12:50)
that's not bad you'll get there yeah you (12:48 - 12:51)
can do it (12:50 - 12:53)
how about this i'll come up for (12:51 - 12:54)
community day we'll go to (12:53 - 12:57)
mall of america i am not going into the (12:54 - 12:58)
death mall (12:57 - 13:00)
oh yeah i wouldn't go into mall of (12:58 - 13:02)
america either uh trust me (13:00 - 13:06)
i was there on monday this past monday (13:02 - 13:09)
i was one of six total shoppers (13:06 - 13:11)
in the entirety of the mall that place (13:09 - 13:14)
is probably the safest place on earth to (13:11 - 13:17)
be right now interesting (13:14 - 13:19)
you can keep 30 feet of space like (13:17 - 13:20)
between you and (13:19 - 13:22)
every other person there i was at (13:20 - 13:24)
mayfair mall yesterday and it was pretty (13:22 - 13:27)
pretty bustling but maybe it was maybe (13:24 - 13:29)
it feels busy because at least at (13:27 - 13:30)
mayfair they (13:29 - 13:32)
most stores only allow a certain amount (13:30 - 13:33)
of people in (13:32 - 13:36)
so it results in lines of people outside (13:33 - 13:37)
the store (13:36 - 13:39)
no minnesotan goes to mall of america (13:37 - 13:41)
unless they're close to it (13:39 - 13:43)
because there's eight million malls here (13:41 - 13:45)
that actually have things we need (13:43 - 13:47)
so when franklin is down mall of america (13:45 - 13:48)
has nothing (13:47 - 13:50)
there's nothing involved america that i (13:48 - 13:53)
think oh only mall of america has that (13:50 - 13:55)
and the things that it only has are (13:53 - 13:57)
literally things i don't need in my life (13:55 - 13:59)
right like why would a local person go (13:57 - 14:01)
to mall of america where they charge (13:59 - 14:04)
two dollars minimum extra on everything (14:01 - 14:06)
because it's it's a tourist thing so if (14:04 - 14:08)
you're not getting tourists then yeah it (14:06 - 14:10)
would be empty (14:08 - 14:12)
but because it's empty it makes doing (14:10 - 14:13)
raids and stuff that (14:12 - 14:16)
you could count on in mall of america (14:13 - 14:17)
that much harder (14:16 - 14:19)
yeah but if there was like if like you (14:17 - 14:20)
and (14:19 - 14:23)
will decided to go to mall america (14:20 - 14:24)
because it's heated (14:23 - 14:26)
because maybe on those days it'll be (14:24 - 14:28)
empty it's not heated (14:26 - 14:31)
it's not then they don't have a heating (14:28 - 14:32)
system (14:31 - 14:34)
the two of you would be able to invite (14:32 - 14:36)
probably one to two people and you could (14:34 - 14:37)
do any rate you want (14:36 - 14:42)
valid how am i going to invite you (14:37 - 14:44)
you're gonna fight me i'm doing raids oh (14:42 - 14:46)
i mean remote raids i'm sorry (14:44 - 14:48)
that's not a world i live in oh my gosh (14:46 - 14:50)
you get the free raid passes you you (14:48 - 14:52)
both log in you both can (14:50 - 14:55)
invite up to five people i do and they (14:52 - 14:56)
don't show up (14:55 - 14:59)
granted i don't warn them and it's only (14:56 - 15:01)
an esper (14:59 - 15:04)
yeah oh speaking of that uh pokemon (15:01 - 15:06)
first discovered in the kalos region are (15:04 - 15:07)
here (15:06 - 15:09)
uh chespin fennekin froakie bunnelby (15:07 - 15:10)
fletchling lit leo (15:09 - 15:14)
and noibat are in the wild i guess (15:10 - 15:17)
they decided to make noibat the rare one (15:14 - 15:20)
this is i'm not i've seen that i'm not (15:17 - 15:22)
i'm never surprised like (15:20 - 15:24)
i was surprised when they made marie so (15:22 - 15:25)
rare (15:24 - 15:30)
i was like huh maureep interesting (15:25 - 15:33)
and they they they take certain pokemon (15:30 - 15:35)
and they make them rare for whatever (15:33 - 15:36)
reason it's fine (15:35 - 15:40)
but out of all the pokemon i i maybe i (15:36 - 15:40)
think i (15:40 - 15:43)
i expected lit leo to be more rare but (15:40 - 15:44)
literally i was like the b (15:43 - 15:47)
doof of the game yeah but lit leo (15:44 - 15:51)
is i mean thinking (15:47 - 15:54)
it's the squirrel isn't it no it's a (15:51 - 15:54)
lion (15:54 - 15:58)
it's a lion but it's like the (15:54 - 16:02)
it's the normal type the grout one (15:58 - 16:04)
cheesy garbage is he wrote no he's like (16:02 - 16:06)
route five (16:04 - 16:09)
he's route he's route to the side of the (16:06 - 16:10)
first town (16:09 - 16:12)
his route one's bundle b and i'm already (16:10 - 16:15)
seeing enough bomb (16:12 - 16:15)
noibat is the rare one no that's not (16:15 - 16:20)
yeah no i mean there's no game more (16:19 - 16:22)
noibats rare i mean like noibat is in (16:20 - 16:23)
the first cave (16:22 - 16:25)
of the first trial of sun and moon and (16:23 - 16:27)
ultrasound ultra moon and (16:25 - 16:29)
obviously didn't debut in that game but (16:27 - 16:30)
you get them (16:29 - 16:33)
relatively not late in (16:30 - 16:36)
x and y it took me a very long time to (16:33 - 16:38)
find a froakie and i'm not happy about (16:36 - 16:38)
that (16:38 - 16:41)
bennikin is like non-stop spawning in my (16:38 - 16:44)
house yeah i got tons of fennec (16:41 - 16:47)
but like we are literally a million (16:44 - 16:48)
lakes (16:47 - 16:51)
i should have froakie abundance (16:48 - 16:55)
and i have none i have one geography (16:51 - 16:56)
you live on the side of town where (16:55 - 16:58)
there's not lakes (16:56 - 17:01)
because you live up there i'm down here (16:58 - 17:04)
with lake after lake after lake (17:01 - 17:06)
we do live at the top of the river (17:04 - 17:07)
valley that is true (17:06 - 17:10)
but there's a giant river very close to (17:07 - 17:11)
my house (17:10 - 17:13)
froakies don't like rivers it wouldn't (17:11 - 17:15)
surprise me if uh (17:13 - 17:17)
frokey was the rarest of the three (17:15 - 17:19)
because greninja is so popular (17:17 - 17:21)
i mean fennekin's cuter not when it (17:19 - 17:23)
evolves (17:21 - 17:26)
oh lies you like delphox i think it's (17:23 - 17:26)
okay i (17:26 - 17:29)
love gelfox it's okay like better than (17:26 - 17:31)
greninja with a (17:29 - 17:34)
tongue (17:31 - 17:34)
remember when we went to the world (17:37 - 17:40)
tournament last year (17:38 - 17:43)
and they had dell fox plushes and (17:40 - 17:45)
greninja plushes but they didn't even (17:43 - 17:46)
bother to bring (17:45 - 17:49)
just not lunches it's because somebody (17:46 - 17:51)
bought them all out (17:49 - 17:54)
yeah lover 101 was like yum yum yum (17:51 - 17:56)
yum okay i don't think this show has (17:54 - 17:57)
enough hot takes (17:56 - 18:00)
i brought one this week i'm not ready (17:57 - 18:01)
but do it anyways (18:00 - 18:05)
we need like a hot take uh spice alerts (18:01 - 18:08)
spice alerts spice alerts this is a real (18:05 - 18:10)
says steve's about to say something (18:08 - 18:11)
these (18:10 - 18:15)
kind of dumb people exactly no no no i (18:11 - 18:16)
think you guys will agree (18:15 - 18:19)
these pokemon go fans that (18:16 - 18:22)
that complained left and right on social (18:19 - 18:25)
media on the reddits on the twitters (18:22 - 18:27)
these people complained about mega (18:25 - 18:28)
evolution (18:27 - 18:32)
being a scam being a rip-off being (18:28 - 18:35)
not worth their dollars and these are (18:32 - 18:36)
the still true (18:35 - 18:38)
these are the same people who bragged (18:36 - 18:39)
about doing (18:38 - 18:41)
30 esper raids so they could get to (18:39 - 18:43)
level 41. (18:41 - 18:47)
they refused and whined all the way to (18:43 - 18:47)
the (18:47 - 18:50)
farm is that an expression that no mega (18:47 - 18:52)
evolution was a ripoff (18:50 - 18:56)
but they still is they just dropped 30 (18:52 - 18:58)
to do as many espers as they could so (18:56 - 18:59)
they could get to level 41. (18:58 - 19:04)
it is hmm hey how is that a hot take (18:59 - 19:07)
and how is that just not you complaining (19:04 - 19:09)
i mean i'm complaining about the people (19:07 - 19:10)
complaining because it's hypocritical (19:09 - 19:12)
hypocritical (19:10 - 19:13)
why is it hypocritical to be like i (19:12 - 19:15)
don't want to spend a dollar on mega (19:13 - 19:16)
evolution but they'll spend a dollar on (19:15 - 19:18)
esper just to get to level (19:16 - 19:22)
41 the money it was about the fact that (19:18 - 19:25)
mega evolution was too short they get (19:22 - 19:25)
they (19:25 - 19:28)
you get to keep every asper that you can (19:25 - 19:29)
keep (19:28 - 19:32)
everyone is forever and you have to keep (19:29 - 19:34)
re-evolving (19:32 - 19:36)
your so means you have to do those mega (19:34 - 19:38)
raids they are different things (19:36 - 19:40)
i can't tell if you're sliding with them (19:38 - 19:42)
just to play devil's at the kid are you (19:40 - 19:45)
exciting with them (19:42 - 19:45)
dude i've got to be the first to level (19:46 - 19:49)
50. otherwise (19:48 - 19:52)
i'm i don't know it's just like why do (19:49 - 19:55)
you have to be the first at level 50 (19:52 - 19:57)
because because i have no other meaning (19:55 - 19:59)
in my life there you go (19:57 - 20:02)
fair i i don't think they're the same (19:59 - 20:03)
but (20:02 - 20:06)
go you do your hot take spicy space i (20:03 - 20:07)
think the rewards you get from mega (20:06 - 20:08)
evolution (20:07 - 20:11)
are worth the the rare candy the tms (20:08 - 20:13)
all that stuff is worth the dollar (20:11 - 20:15)
compared to the nothing you get from (20:13 - 20:17)
esper because the one star raid i mean (20:15 - 20:19)
if people want to spend 30 dollars to (20:17 - 20:19)
get to level (20:19 - 20:21)
i mean their people did spend 30 dollars (20:19 - 20:23)
to get to 41 in (20:21 - 20:26)
a day i will spend (20:23 - 20:28)
at most at this point five dollars to (20:26 - 20:31)
maybe get to 40. (20:28 - 20:33)
well i have like i have i still have no (20:31 - 20:34)
problem spending a dollar to do a mega (20:33 - 20:35)
raid (20:34 - 20:38)
if you got the mega obama snow i'm (20:35 - 20:38)
interested (20:38 - 20:42)
because i think they're fun and i want (20:38 - 20:43)
that candy (20:42 - 20:44)
and i want to make it evolve so when i (20:43 - 20:46)
do a raid it saves me more time (20:44 - 20:49)

be able to ignore your family by (24:20 - 24:23)

it's a cool event i'm glad they're doing (24:32 - 24:35)
stuff like that (24:34 - 24:37)
it'd be nice if pokemon masters also (24:35 - 24:39)
does something of the sort (24:37 - 24:40)
well they kind of did earlier the year (24:39 - 24:42)
before the movie got delayed they had (24:40 - 24:43)
something planned (24:42 - 24:46)
yeah they did but it'd be nice to (24:43 - 24:48)
see a little bonus thing especially (24:46 - 24:50)
around the holidays they showed off (24:48 - 24:52)
erica and skyla i don't think they (24:50 - 24:54)

a champion's path and vivid voltage yeah (27:27 - 27:30)

collection includes really boom is that (27:33 - 27:37)

tcg booster packs for your deck what's a (27:52 - 27:56)
sidekick dangler (27:54 - 27:58)
uh that is your cell phone it's a (27:56 - 28:00)
keychain (27:58 - 28:02)
oh okay they did the same thing with the (28:00 - 28:03)
small but mighty where you had like a (28:02 - 28:04)
jiggly puff (28:03 - 28:08)
or an iggly buff cliff cleffa and uh (28:04 - 28:11)
smoocham i think igly buff club are they (28:08 - 28:13)
keychains are they like cellphone charms (28:11 - 28:14)
no they're (28:13 - 28:16)
they're bigger they're keychains they're (28:14 - 28:18)
probably half the size of a cell phone (28:16 - 28:21)
bang that is available the other thing (28:18 - 28:24)
is okay so there's a lot of hype around (28:21 - 28:25)
a set called (28:24 - 28:29)
shining star v which is available in (28:25 - 28:29)
japan (28:29 - 28:34)
and i think they make korean taiwanese (28:29 - 28:35)
sets too anyways there's not an english (28:34 - 28:37)
set shining star v (28:35 - 28:41)
is the newest set in japan (28:37 - 28:43)
it is their one of japan's biggest sets (28:41 - 28:45)
ever has 300 cards (28:43 - 28:47)
in that set how many of them are (28:45 - 28:48)
charizards (28:47 - 28:52)
probably at least 100 of the 300 (28:48 - 28:55)
uh and by the name shiny star v it (28:52 - 28:56)
features a lot of shiny (28:55 - 28:59)
pokemon in the set and all of those (28:56 - 29:01)
packs have (28:59 - 29:04)
the phantom challenge code cards in them (29:01 - 29:07)
i did a youtube video of how to do the (29:04 - 29:07)
phantom (29:07 - 29:09)
challenge and how to sign up for it and (29:07 - 29:10)
how to register for it shout out to (29:09 - 29:12)
andrew for (29:10 - 29:14)
helping me translate some of that stuff (29:12 - 29:17)
but ultimately the phantom challenge is (29:14 - 29:18)
it's not new to japan they do this all (29:17 - 29:21)
the time we just don't hear about a lot (29:18 - 29:22)
of it because (29:21 - 29:23)
it's usually for like a chancey or (29:22 - 29:25)
something (29:23 - 29:26)
but in this case the phantom challenge (29:25 - 29:28)
is for mars shadow genesect and (29:26 - 29:30)
volcanion (29:28 - 29:32)
and there's only been one volcanion and (29:30 - 29:34)
one marshall distribution in the united (29:32 - 29:36)
states so far so obviously those two (29:34 - 29:38)
pokemon are pretty sought after (29:36 - 29:39)
they do these distributions all the time (29:38 - 29:41)
in japan so maybe not a sought after but (29:39 - 29:43)
what the pokemon company likes to do is (29:41 - 29:44)
they like to partner with companies like (29:43 - 29:46)
mr donut or like 7-eleven (29:44 - 29:48)
or oh gosh what's that big department (29:46 - 29:50)
store anyways (29:48 - 29:51)
and when you buy stuff there you get (29:50 - 29:53)
points you redeem the points then you (29:51 - 29:54)
cash in those points for mythical (29:53 - 29:56)
pokemon or other things (29:54 - 29:59)
chances stuff like that the the (29:56 - 30:00)
importance (29:59 - 30:04)
is that shiny star v has the code cards (30:00 - 30:07)
inside so if you import shiny star v (30:04 - 30:09)
you can redeem the code cards right away (30:07 - 30:11)
because you need 30 points to get (30:09 - 30:11)
everything (30:11 - 30:14)
in the phantom challenge and each code (30:11 - 30:16)
card each pack of shiny star v (30:14 - 30:18)
has four points and there's 10 points in (30:16 - 30:20)
a pack basic math 40 points gets you (30:18 - 30:21)
everything (30:20 - 30:24)
now in japan you can buy any other (30:21 - 30:25)
booster pack like (30:24 - 30:27)
their vivid voltage their darkness (30:25 - 30:29)
ablaze (30:27 - 30:31)
their space set sword and shield (30:29 - 30:32)
obviously their names are a little (30:31 - 30:32)
different (30:32 - 30:34)
but you have to buy them at a pokemon (30:32 - 30:36)
center and then they give you the points (30:34 - 30:36)
because (30:36 - 30:38)
those sets have already been created so (30:36 - 30:39)
they haven't had they didn't have time (30:38 - 30:41)
to put the code cards in (30:39 - 30:44)
but plush's cards um figures they all (30:41 - 30:46)
qualify for points for the phantom (30:44 - 30:46)
challenge (30:46 - 30:49)
but if you were to import you know older (30:46 - 30:50)
cards (30:49 - 30:51)
you're not going to get the points (30:50 - 30:52)
because you have to buy them (30:51 - 30:54)
specifically at a pokemon center (30:52 - 30:57)
shiny star v is the exception to that (30:54 - 30:58)
but now (30:57 - 31:00)
fast forward to like three days ago the (30:58 - 31:02)
pokemon company announced that (31:00 - 31:06)
shining fates is a (31:02 - 31:10)
expansion that will be coming out (31:06 - 31:13)
on february 19th which is a couple days (31:10 - 31:15)
before their 25th anniversary it will (31:13 - 31:15)
feature (31:15 - 31:20)
190 cards 100 of those will be shiny (31:15 - 31:22)
they will not be sold separately they (31:20 - 31:24)
will be sold in special collections (31:22 - 31:26)
just like champion's path just like (31:24 - 31:28)
hidden fates just like (31:26 - 31:31)
shining legends really creative name (31:28 - 31:32)
here (31:31 - 31:35)
so i wouldn't be surprised normally we (31:32 - 31:36)
get one special set a year (31:35 - 31:39)
this past year was champion's path the (31:36 - 31:40)
year before that was (31:39 - 31:41)
hidden fates i wouldn't be surprised if (31:40 - 31:44)
we get two or three special sets (31:41 - 31:47)
going into the 25th anniversary since (31:44 - 31:49)
we're already getting one in february (31:47 - 31:51)
but what this is actually going to do (31:49 - 31:54)
though is cause the price of shiny v (31:51 - 31:55)
star to drop (31:54 - 31:59)
because normally japanese cards are only (31:55 - 32:01)
worth a lot of money when there's not an (31:59 - 32:02)
english counterpart and there were (32:01 - 32:04)
people that didn't believe that shiny v (32:02 - 32:05)
star was going to come to the united (32:04 - 32:06)
states (32:05 - 32:09)
but it is as of now uh (32:06 - 32:12)
so if you want to import shiny the for (32:09 - 32:13)
the codes and because you want to (32:12 - 32:15)
collect cards (32:13 - 32:16)
you're going to look you're looking at (32:15 - 32:18)
about a hundred dollars to do that (32:16 - 32:22)
on ebay or on um import sites (32:18 - 32:25)
shiny star v in japan is about (32:22 - 32:28)
6 000 yen i believe which is about 50 (32:25 - 32:29)
bucks (32:28 - 32:31)
which makes sense because oh gosh this (32:29 - 32:33)
is a lot more explaining than i'm used (32:31 - 32:33)
to (32:33 - 32:37)
a booster box in japan is 30 packs (32:33 - 32:40)
and in those packs are five cards (32:37 - 32:42)
each because japan booster japanese (32:40 - 32:43)
booster packs are (32:42 - 32:46)
five cards in a pack where english packs (32:43 - 32:47)
are (32:46 - 32:49)
10 cards so normally their booster box (32:47 - 32:51)
is around (32:49 - 32:55)
like 4 000 yen but these shiny star v (32:51 - 32:58)
are 6 000 yen but you're guaranteed a (32:55 - 33:01)
hollow or better in every pack and their (32:58 - 33:02)
packs have 10 (33:01 - 33:05)
cards so that's why this special set in (33:02 - 33:07)
japan is a little bit more money (33:05 - 33:08)
so if you do decide to import it you (33:07 - 33:10)
will be paying almost double (33:08 - 33:12)
what it costs in japan but you do get (33:10 - 33:14)
the cards for the phantom challenge (33:12 - 33:16)
you can just go to ebay and buy the (33:14 - 33:17)
cards for significantly less which i (33:16 - 33:19)
think is what greg did (33:17 - 33:21)
so it's totally up to you but if you are (33:19 - 33:23)
buying my only advice is if you're (33:21 - 33:24)
buying shiny star v (33:23 - 33:27)
for resale value of reselling the cards (33:24 - 33:29)
the american pokemon company just threw (33:27 - 33:29)
a wrench in that (33:29 - 33:33)
because english cards always almost (33:29 - 33:34)
always there are exceptions but almost (33:33 - 33:36)
always will result (33:34 - 33:39)
better and for more money than (33:36 - 33:41)
japanese cards we're done with that (33:39 - 33:42)
conversation now (33:41 - 33:45)
well i i don't have any questions but (33:42 - 33:47)
now i finally understand what that like (33:45 - 33:50)
30 back and forth message text message (33:47 - 33:51)
conversation that when i was trying to (33:50 - 33:52)
ride my (33:51 - 33:55)
bike and i kept getting interrupted was (33:52 - 33:56)
all about (33:55 - 33:58)
thank you yeah and i thought i was (33:56 - 34:00)
buying codes for the (33:58 - 34:03)
japanese website i didn't yeah well you (34:00 - 34:03)
didn't (34:03 - 34:06)
mess it up per se you just mess it up (34:03 - 34:07)
per se (34:06 - 34:09)
i just cut out having to use the website (34:07 - 34:12)
right so i did a youtube video (34:09 - 34:14)
uh how to do the phantom challenge which (34:12 - 34:16)
is one of the best youtube videos i (34:14 - 34:17)
think i put it it is like literally the (34:16 - 34:19)
second best youtube video i put out this (34:17 - 34:21)
year so thank you to (34:19 - 34:23)
i guess people really liked it by the (34:21 - 34:24)
way we're trying to get to 10 000 (34:23 - 34:25)
youtube subs before the end of the year (34:24 - 34:27)
and i think we're at like 8 000 now (34:25 - 34:28)
which is awesome (34:27 - 34:30)
maybe we can get there if you haven't (34:28 - 34:32)
subbed or gone over to the youtube (34:30 - 34:34)
now is the reason to but pretty much (34:32 - 34:35)
what happens in the phantom challenge (34:34 - 34:38)
is you gotta scan these code cards into (34:35 - 34:39)
this website (34:38 - 34:41)
run by the pokemon company and then once (34:39 - 34:42)
you get enough points you hit like (34:41 - 34:43)
redeem (34:42 - 34:46)
prize and then it it gives you a code (34:43 - 34:48)
that you can redeem on your nintendo (34:46 - 34:51)
switch what greg ended up buying from my (34:48 - 34:52)
understanding (34:51 - 34:55)
is the finalized code so (34:52 - 34:56)
somebody redeemed the points for you you (34:55 - 34:58)
just ended up buying the code (34:56 - 35:02)
yes which is very confusing because (34:58 - 35:04)
i searched for the exact same thing you (35:02 - 35:05)
said in the video (35:04 - 35:08)
i watched the video to the end and then (35:05 - 35:10)
i ordered it from the person that you (35:08 - 35:11)
had mentioned in the video (35:10 - 35:13)
it looked to save and then i got them (35:11 - 35:14)
and i'm trying to put them into the (35:13 - 35:15)
website (35:14 - 35:17)
and i'm like they're not being accepted (35:15 - 35:19)
and then i read the email closely and (35:17 - 35:21)
how it was broken down i'm like (35:19 - 35:24)
oh these are codes that actually have to (35:21 - 35:24)
enter (35:24 - 35:26)
into my switch these are the final (35:24 - 35:28)
product that makes this a whole lot (35:26 - 35:29)
easier (35:28 - 35:31)
i wonder it's more work for the seller (35:29 - 35:32)
to do that (35:31 - 35:33)
because they have to go to the web so (35:32 - 35:34)
they have to make an account because you (35:33 - 35:36)
can only do it once per account so if (35:34 - 35:38)
they're selling multiples of these they (35:36 - 35:40)
have to make multiple accounts with (35:38 - 35:41)
multiple emails (35:40 - 35:42)
because you have to verify the email (35:41 - 35:44)
which is what i show in the video (35:42 - 35:46)
and then they have to punch in the (35:44 - 35:47)
numbers for the codes (35:46 - 35:51)
to then get the switch codes it's very (35:47 - 35:52)
confusing that's why i made a video (35:51 - 35:54)
about it (35:52 - 35:56)
so it's more work for them but i wonder (35:54 - 35:57)
if they can charge more (35:56 - 35:59)
because some people just don't want to (35:57 - 36:01)
do that middle step i just explained (35:59 - 36:04)
i mean yeah but was it expensive (36:01 - 36:06)
no i mean i paid less than what you (36:04 - 36:08)
should in the video (36:06 - 36:10)
yeah yeah like what i did in the video (36:08 - 36:12)
is i just well i didn't want to like (36:10 - 36:14)
single out a seller but i also wanted to (36:12 - 36:16)
recommend a seller that i know (36:14 - 36:18)
that was safe (36:16 - 36:18)
but i didn't want to be like i didn't (36:19 - 36:23)
want anyone to think like oh steve has (36:21 - 36:24)
like a deal with this dude that's why (36:23 - 36:26)
he's recommending it's like no i just (36:24 - 36:28)
i just did a quick search i definitely (36:26 - 36:30)
recognized that name that i bought and (36:28 - 36:30)
stuff (36:30 - 36:32)
from that dude before so i can at least (36:30 - 36:33)
vouch that this dude (36:32 - 36:36)
provides like it's not a scam but also (36:33 - 36:37)
like there is no partnership it's just (36:36 - 36:40)
i've ordered from this dude before but i (36:37 - 36:41)
i knew for sure (36:40 - 36:43)
that you could find cheaper if you (36:41 - 36:44)
looked a little harder (36:43 - 36:46)
so that was kind of what i was um (36:44 - 36:48)
leading (36:46 - 36:50)
so basically what happened was uh the (36:48 - 36:52)
dude recognized greg's name (36:50 - 36:55)
and was like oh celebrity i gotta get (36:52 - 36:58)
special treatment yeah i mean i'm into (36:55 - 36:58)
that (36:58 - 37:00)
i also think though because next year is (36:58 - 37:02)
the 25th anniversary there will be (37:00 - 37:04)
plenty of mythicals (37:02 - 37:07)
given out i'm sure of it okay yes so (37:04 - 37:08)
here's a question (37:07 - 37:10)
steve all of them come as being from (37:08 - 37:12)
japan right (37:10 - 37:14)
okay and they have they have japanese (37:12 - 37:15)
names and then the (37:14 - 37:16)
english names under that i'm like this (37:15 - 37:18)
is weird me out of it (37:16 - 37:21)
yeah so um some (37:18 - 37:23)
if they know this is why i know this (37:21 - 37:25)
event this event specifically is never (37:23 - 37:26)
going to come to america (37:25 - 37:28)
and the reason for that is because (37:26 - 37:30)
japanese (37:28 - 37:32)
it might come to america in a way where (37:30 - 37:33)
they're like oh they're doing a (37:32 - 37:34)
volcanion distribution but they're not (37:33 - 37:36)
going to do a volcanion martial genocide (37:34 - 37:37)
distribution in (37:36 - 37:40)
like go to your local 7-eleven get a (37:37 - 37:41)
g-fuel (37:40 - 37:43)
and then get the code printed on the (37:41 - 37:45)
receipt and then go to a website and (37:43 - 37:46)
redeem it like that's never coming to (37:45 - 37:47)
america that is (37:46 - 37:49)
something they've done in japan for (37:47 - 37:51)
multiple distributions and stuff (37:49 - 37:54)
but usually if the if the pokemon name (37:51 - 37:56)
is locked to a language in this case (37:54 - 37:58)
when you redeem volcanion it will be (37:56 - 38:00)
volcanion's japanese name that means (37:58 - 38:02)
that like they had no plans for this to (38:00 - 38:03)
ever leave (38:02 - 38:06)
whereas like if you redeem zarude from a (38:03 - 38:08)
japanese movie ticket (38:06 - 38:12)
if you redeem it in english it will have (38:08 - 38:14)
in your english game it will have (38:12 - 38:15)
zarood's english name and if you redeem (38:14 - 38:16)
it in a german (38:15 - 38:19)
game it will have zarood's german name (38:16 - 38:21)
and then if you redeem it on your (38:19 - 38:22)
japanese switch it will have zuru's (38:21 - 38:23)
japanese name so (38:22 - 38:26)
that's so when you do redeem these they (38:23 - 38:27)
will have the (38:26 - 38:29)
japanese pokemon names but that's only (38:27 - 38:30)
because (38:29 - 38:33)
they were locked to it not locked the (38:30 - 38:34)
names are locked but the event is not (38:33 - 38:36)
locked to japan since switches are (38:34 - 38:37)
region locked (38:36 - 38:39)
not region locked sorry but they're (38:37 - 38:41)
still like their cherished ball pokemon (38:39 - 38:42)
with the ribbons and (38:41 - 38:43)
and everything but they're just locked (38:42 - 38:45)
to a specific id name (38:43 - 38:48)
etc it's a cool event in japan i just (38:45 - 38:49)
wanted to bring light to it (38:48 - 38:52)
and i know some people are really (38:49 - 38:54)
desperate for volcanion or (38:52 - 38:57)
or marshadow or whatnot so um anyways (38:54 - 38:59)
uh that youtube video will be i'll put (38:57 - 39:01)
in the show notes but otherwise the (38:59 - 39:03)
youtube is just pk mencast (39:01 - 39:05)
shiny fates is coming um there is still (39:03 - 39:07)
the tcg problem right now (39:05 - 39:10)
um where i walked i walked into a mire (39:07 - 39:11)
and they (39:10 - 39:13)
didn't have a single booster pack they (39:11 - 39:15)
didn't even have theme decks (39:13 - 39:17)
um the target i went to the other day (39:15 - 39:18)
has not restocked (39:17 - 39:21)
in over a month and the only thing they (39:18 - 39:22)
have (39:21 - 39:25)
is um like rebel clash elite trainer (39:22 - 39:26)
boxes which aren't the worst (39:25 - 39:30)
um and uh good old crimson invasion (39:26 - 39:32)
elite trainer boxes which no one in the (39:30 - 39:34)
entire world should ever buy (39:32 - 39:35)
we were talking about wasting money (39:34 - 39:37)
prior to the show if you want to really (39:35 - 39:38)
waste your money (39:37 - 39:41)
well crimson i would like to provide (39:38 - 39:42)
also uh (39:41 - 39:45)
clarification for our listeners that are (39:42 - 39:45)
not (39:45 - 39:48)
in a very very targeted specific section (39:45 - 39:50)
of the midwest (39:48 - 39:52)
steve did not walk into a swamp exactly (39:50 - 39:55)
he walked into an (39:52 - 39:57)
e m-e-i-j-e-r which i originally thought (39:55 - 39:58)
was pronounced (39:57 - 40:02)
may hair um it is a store (39:58 - 40:05)
similar to tar it's kind of between (40:02 - 40:07)
target and walmart and quality that's (40:05 - 40:08)
the best way i can describe i would i (40:07 - 40:11)
would agree with you 100 i would say it (40:08 - 40:13)
leans more towards the walmart (40:11 - 40:16)
it's the new kmart yeah like it's (40:13 - 40:20)
kmart quality yes between (40:16 - 40:23)
target and walmart but closer to walmart (40:20 - 40:24)
yes it's like a step up from walmart for (40:23 - 40:25)
sure (40:24 - 40:28)
yeah but the because of the current tcg (40:25 - 40:29)
fad (40:28 - 40:30)
which i feel like i should make a (40:29 - 40:33)
youtube video about explaining that more (40:30 - 40:34)
in depth (40:33 - 40:36)
cards are still really really hard to (40:34 - 40:37)
find (40:36 - 40:40)
and i think this is the pyramid scheme (40:37 - 40:40)
stuff (40:40 - 40:42)
yeah the more pyramid scheme stuff i (40:40 - 40:43)
think this is the other part to keep in (40:42 - 40:44)
mind (40:43 - 40:45)
that i didn't really think about till (40:44 - 40:47)
the other day until somebody pointed (40:45 - 40:48)
this out (40:47 - 40:51)
the fad currently of like i want to buy (40:48 - 40:52)
an (40:51 - 40:55)
old booster box and i want to pull (40:52 - 40:57)
like a dark charizard first edition (40:55 - 40:59)
which i think dark charizard first (40:57 - 41:01)
edition is like 20 a 25 (40:59 - 41:04)
000 card that is only (41:01 - 41:07)
if that charizard is graded at a psa (41:04 - 41:12)
10 if it's not if it's psa 9 (41:07 - 41:15)
it's no longer 25 000 and (41:12 - 41:18)
that is assuming that you're getting it (41:15 - 41:20)
psa graded that day (41:18 - 41:23)
but because of the pandemic and because (41:20 - 41:23)
of current (41:23 - 41:27)
card fads in both pokemon magic (41:23 - 41:31)
yu-gi-oh etc psa is extremely backed up (41:27 - 41:34)
and if you send a dark charizard there (41:31 - 41:36)
you're not gonna see it for four to five (41:34 - 41:38)
months i believe as of this recording (41:36 - 41:39)
i'd have to double check (41:38 - 41:43)
and how fads work is that card was not (41:39 - 41:45)
that expensive months ago and it is (41:43 - 41:46)
expensive now (41:45 - 41:48)
who's to say it's going to be just as (41:46 - 41:50)
expensive in five months when you get it (41:48 - 41:50)
back (41:50 - 41:54)
assuming that it's even psa 10. (41:50 - 41:57)
so i don't know i don't know if when we (41:54 - 42:00)
get to february for shining fates (41:57 - 42:02)
which seems like a very fun set um (42:00 - 42:03)
hidden fates was (42:02 - 42:05)
probably one of the most fun sets to (42:03 - 42:07)
open if we'll even be able to find (42:05 - 42:08)
shining fates (42:07 - 42:11)
like it still feels impossible to find (42:08 - 42:12)
champions path (42:11 - 42:14)
i don't know any pokemon set that has (42:12 - 42:16)
the word shining in it i find very sus (42:14 - 42:19)
i'm i'm out okay (42:16 - 42:22)
more tcg news in a different light we're (42:19 - 42:25)
going to talk about ptcgo real quick (42:22 - 42:27)
there was the players cup 2 this weekend (42:25 - 42:29)
during the twitch stream they did give (42:27 - 42:30)
out a free (42:29 - 42:33)
zashian v for those who watched um (42:30 - 42:36)
it was 50 000 limited as of (42:33 - 42:38)
recording this podcast this morning (42:36 - 42:39)
there were still people were still (42:38 - 42:41)
redeeming them i made a graphic it's on (42:39 - 42:42)
the twitter it's on the instagram of how (42:41 - 42:43)
to redeem that (42:42 - 42:46)
you want a full art zashian v in ptcgo (42:43 - 42:49)
but this news is specific to ptc geo (42:46 - 42:51)
and these tweets came out on november (42:49 - 42:53)
23rd i screenshotted them because i was (42:51 - 42:55)
worried they were going to get deleted i (42:53 - 42:57)
don't think they've been deleted yet (42:55 - 43:00)
but we complain a lot about ptcgo (42:57 - 43:04)
of how i think all three of us (43:00 - 43:06)
would probably play it a lot more if it (43:04 - 43:07)
worked (43:06 - 43:10)
and if it was not looking like an app (43:07 - 43:14)
from 2006 (43:10 - 43:18)
but we know that the developer for ptcgo (43:14 - 43:21)
is a company called direwolf digital (43:18 - 43:24)
and they make a bunch of other board (43:21 - 43:25)
games (43:24 - 43:28)
for pc and mac and they (43:25 - 43:31)
recently tweeted uh they okay (43:28 - 43:34)
they they were getting (43:31 - 43:37)
i guess hate tweets they were getting (43:34 - 43:38)
yelled at they're getting a lot of hate (43:37 - 43:39)
tweet (43:38 - 43:40)
and i can't remember what the specific (43:39 - 43:42)
issue in ptcgo was (43:40 - 43:44)
but people were complaining about (43:42 - 43:45)
something (43:44 - 43:47)
uh let me see if i can find the thread (43:45 - 43:49)
here uh i guess we'll just (43:47 - 43:52)
read it to give context there you go (43:49 - 43:52)
yeah (43:52 - 43:55)
twitter user says can't go ended never (43:52 - 43:57)
because of the pandemic so here's day (43:55 - 43:58)
one of me dming (43:57 - 44:01)
direwolf digital until they do the (43:58 - 44:03)
things that owner of world's (44:01 - 44:06)
most valuable ips pay them to do so they (44:03 - 44:07)
they send (44:06 - 44:09)
they take they took a screenshot of the (44:07 - 44:10)
the dm they sent (44:09 - 44:13)
i am going to uh family friendly (44:10 - 44:17)
uh advise this this message have you (44:13 - 44:18)
guys consid (44:17 - 44:20)
considered zookeeping just curious y'all (44:18 - 44:23)
seem to excel in the industry of big (44:20 - 44:24)
piles of poop (44:23 - 44:28)
[Laughter] (44:24 - 44:31)
i like that that's that's witty just a (44:28 - 44:32)
side note here before we go (44:31 - 44:35)
down this path there are real humans (44:32 - 44:36)
that that (44:35 - 44:40)
receive this on the other end of things (44:36 - 44:43)
as as much as i i think that (44:40 - 44:47)
ptcgo is is not a great app (44:43 - 44:50)
i i don't there are there are real (44:47 - 44:50)
people (44:50 - 44:53)
working on the app they have feelings (44:50 - 44:54)
yeah i mean that goes for everything on (44:53 - 44:55)
the internet (44:54 - 44:58)
that is like literally my experience (44:55 - 44:59)
with dating apps it's like (44:58 - 45:02)
uh hey did you realize i'm a real person (44:59 - 45:03)
here (45:02 - 45:06)
there are like way nicer and more (45:03 - 45:08)
constructive ways to tell people to be (45:06 - 45:08)
like (45:08 - 45:11)
better okay so i mean there's not a lot (45:08 - 45:12)
of traction here (45:11 - 45:15)
like this in itself is not newsworthy it (45:12 - 45:17)
had two retweets and six likes (45:15 - 45:19)
think it was yeah people were not i (45:17 - 45:20)
don't think this guy's like (45:19 - 45:22)
moving mountains people are not in their (45:20 - 45:24)
corner (45:22 - 45:25)
so somebody else tweets back at them (45:24 - 45:27)
they say i have a problem with being (45:25 - 45:29)
harsh on dire wolf because i assume that (45:27 - 45:31)
the pokemon company could make the (45:29 - 45:33)
changes if they wanted every game has (45:31 - 45:34)
bugs i accept that (45:33 - 45:36)
i am positive that there are some (45:34 - 45:37)
employees at the pokemon company that (45:36 - 45:40)
wants ptc geo to be as good as (45:37 - 45:43)
magic the gathering arena or lor (45:40 - 45:46)
legends of runeterra legends of rutera (45:43 - 45:48)
and i assume whoever makes the decisions (45:46 - 45:49)
don't care (45:48 - 45:52)
okay side note i'm gonna stop here i do (45:49 - 45:53)
know people who work at the pokemon (45:52 - 45:55)
company international (45:53 - 45:58)
and i do know that one of the biggest (45:55 - 45:59)
tcg people that works there (45:58 - 46:02)
is well aware that ptcgo is not great (45:59 - 46:06)
and they from what they've told me (46:02 - 46:08)
have said they are working to change (46:06 - 46:10)
that in the future (46:08 - 46:13)
okay back to the conversation direwolf (46:10 - 46:14)
digital then goes (46:13 - 46:18)
in and says thank you (46:14 - 46:21)
kieran the original tweet with the zoo (46:18 - 46:24)
joke kieran being rude to our team and (46:21 - 46:25)
sending offensive dms (46:24 - 46:27)
to our social media folks isn't helpful (46:25 - 46:29)
or fair we have a team (46:27 - 46:32)
who across the board is passionate about (46:29 - 46:34)
making products with a very high quality (46:32 - 46:35)
bar (46:34 - 46:37)
check out any of our other games that's (46:35 - 46:39)
not to say that there aren't bugs or (46:37 - 46:41)
issues that come up especially in a game (46:39 - 46:43)
as large card slash content wise as ptc (46:41 - 46:46)
geo but there always are but our studios (46:43 - 46:48)
work is often recognized as being one of (46:46 - 46:49)
the higher standards (46:48 - 46:52)
in the genre we work for generally (46:49 - 46:53)
speaking (46:52 - 46:56)
we aren't generally speaking why we were (46:53 - 46:57)
silent (46:56 - 46:59)
on getting dunked on here we cannot (46:57 - 47:00)
comment on the decisions that go into (46:59 - 47:02)
the state of some of our products as a (47:00 - 47:04)
dev who works for other large publishers (47:02 - 47:06)
we don't always get to prioritize the (47:04 - 47:07)
things we want (47:06 - 47:09)
no matter how much we lobby uh and (47:07 - 47:11)
that's pretty much it those are the (47:09 - 47:15)
three tweets they did which i feel like (47:11 - 47:18)
says a lot it says exactly (47:15 - 47:19)
the same thing that we've been saying (47:18 - 47:21)
about everything (47:19 - 47:25)
for like at least two years now no (47:21 - 47:28)
sub company no american company no (47:25 - 47:30)
niantic no dire wolf (47:28 - 47:32)
can do anything on their own right they (47:30 - 47:35)
may have to have approval first (47:32 - 47:37)
yeah i mean this is what i this is what (47:35 - 47:38)
i've been saying for (47:37 - 47:41)
you know two plus years in the show is (47:38 - 47:42)
people get (47:41 - 47:45)
mad that niantic made a molga (47:42 - 47:49)
a one-week spawn but it's like (47:45 - 47:52)
no the pokemon company did that (47:49 - 47:55)
like the reason that noibat is rare (47:52 - 47:56)
isn't because (47:55 - 47:57)
of niantic it's because the pokemon (47:56 - 48:00)
company says we need a rare pokemon (47:57 - 48:04)
and let's do know that we want (48:00 - 48:07)
we we want more hat pikachu's niantic (48:04 - 48:08)
here's the model for the next hat we (48:07 - 48:10)
thought of put it into the game like i (48:08 - 48:11)
am (48:10 - 48:13)
like i don't think niantic is sitting (48:11 - 48:15)
around like (48:13 - 48:17)
bordering with a bunch of hats on the (48:15 - 48:18)
wall throwing darts being like this is (48:17 - 48:20)
our next pikachu (48:18 - 48:22)
like this is all coming from the pokemon (48:20 - 48:23)
company (48:22 - 48:26)
if you if you still think that like oh (48:23 - 48:28)
niantic's making these (48:26 - 48:31)
decisions if you think that a free (48:28 - 48:34)
to play game like ptc ptcgo (48:31 - 48:38)
with no way to give pt cgo money (48:34 - 48:40)
is being so strictly controlled by the (48:38 - 48:41)
pokemon company (48:40 - 48:44)
but the thing that makes them the most (48:41 - 48:49)
money undoubtedly millions of dollars (48:44 - 48:51)
a month quarter after quarter of being (48:49 - 48:53)
better than the last quarter (48:51 - 48:55)
if you still think for some reason that (48:53 - 48:57)
like ah that's just niantic making (48:55 - 48:58)
you're (48:57 - 49:01)
out of your mind (48:58 - 49:02)
that the pokemon company would be like (49:01 - 49:05)
we need to strangle this (49:02 - 49:08)
board game app but hey (49:05 - 49:11)
you guys over here do what like no way (49:08 - 49:13)
well the question is like why why do (49:11 - 49:15)
they not care (49:13 - 49:17)
not not care why are there just not more (49:15 - 49:20)
resources to pcc geo why do they not (49:17 - 49:21)
want to compete (49:20 - 49:23)
at the level of magic the gathering do (49:21 - 49:26)
they even outside of the (49:23 - 49:30)
computer game world they are (49:26 - 49:32)
sitting on the same shelf as magic and (49:30 - 49:34)
yu-gi-oh well (49:32 - 49:36)
depending on so greg let me let me just (49:34 - 49:37)
jump in (49:36 - 49:40)
for it quick so my main thing (49:37 - 49:42)
that i think people easily forget and (49:40 - 49:44)
steve you just don't have as much (49:42 - 49:48)
exposure to is ptcgo (49:44 - 49:52)
has been around for what a decade (49:48 - 49:54)
is just about 10 years now yeah it (49:52 - 49:55)
launched it launched (49:54 - 49:59)
when when we kind of first met will (49:55 - 50:02)
yeah all right so eight years nine years (49:59 - 50:05)
mtg arena the actual (50:02 - 50:09)
good mtg to play online has been around (50:05 - 50:10)
for about (50:09 - 50:13)
two years yep and (50:10 - 50:15)
was very broken for the first year oh (50:13 - 50:17)
heck yeah it was (50:15 - 50:20)
and if you actually look at what wizards (50:17 - 50:24)
provided as a play interface (50:20 - 50:28)
previous to mtg arena it was horrible (50:24 - 50:29)
i mean it's still out there you can (50:28 - 50:31)
still see it it's terrible (50:29 - 50:33)
gathering and they charge you money for (50:31 - 50:34)
that it is (50:33 - 50:38)
awful it's it's it's not a fair (50:34 - 50:41)
comparison number one and number two (50:38 - 50:43)
what that makes very clear (50:41 - 50:47)
is if they wanted to make a significant (50:43 - 50:50)
improvement slash revision to pctc geo (50:47 - 50:52)
they'd have to scrap what they currently (50:50 - 50:54)
have and (50:52 - 50:57)
start fresh yep and that is just (50:54 - 51:01)
a huge mountain to get over (50:57 - 51:02)
that that would be a huge amount of (51:01 - 51:05)
investment for as you said (51:02 - 51:07)
something that does not collect money (51:05 - 51:08)
and i guarantee you (51:07 - 51:12)
if there was some way if they opened up (51:08 - 51:14)
something like a subscription pt cgo (51:12 - 51:14)
subscription (51:14 - 51:18)
or directly buy packs through ptc geo (51:14 - 51:19)
which would probably get them off of uh (51:18 - 51:23)
ipads people would they're (51:19 - 51:25)
what is the expression you their minds (51:23 - 51:27)
would explode (51:25 - 51:29)
the brains would fly out of there yeah (51:27 - 51:30)
how dare (51:29 - 51:33)
no i i i agree that like the only way at (51:30 - 51:36)
this point to save ptcgo is to (51:33 - 51:38)
start over yeah and there there were (51:36 - 51:40)
rumors that (51:38 - 51:42)
there were rumors that whoever makes (51:40 - 51:44)
magic the gathering arena i don't know (51:42 - 51:46)
who who the developer on that is (51:44 - 51:49)
there was rumors that they were making a (51:46 - 51:51)
new version of ptc joe (51:49 - 51:53)
i mean it is also possible that like (51:51 - 51:54)
could be possible that direwolf digital (51:53 - 51:56)
is working (51:54 - 51:58)
on a new version of ptc geo because the (51:56 - 51:59)
framework is so bad that they have to (51:58 - 52:01)
start over (51:59 - 52:03)
but if if the pokemon company just came (52:01 - 52:04)
out and said that (52:03 - 52:08)
and said look this app is nine years old (52:04 - 52:10)
we can't the game has changed so much (52:08 - 52:11)
since then (52:10 - 52:14)
i mean nine years ago i think at one (52:11 - 52:15)
point in the game you could give it (52:14 - 52:17)
money and then they removed it i think (52:15 - 52:18)
that was like the first six months (52:17 - 52:21)
if they want but now because of the (52:18 - 52:22)
success (52:21 - 52:25)
of pokemon masters and because of the (52:22 - 52:26)
success of pokemon go (52:25 - 52:29)
they clearly are okay with taking money (52:26 - 52:31)
especially if that money is like five (52:29 - 52:33)
dollars a week which (52:31 - 52:34)
i don't know what the average i i don't (52:33 - 52:35)
know what the average pokemon go player (52:34 - 52:36)
gives (52:35 - 52:39)
niantic or or what not but (52:36 - 52:41)
like that would i think that in itself (52:39 - 52:43)
would be a huge (52:41 - 52:45)
25th anniversary announcement to be like (52:43 - 52:46)
hey (52:45 - 52:49)
yeah we are rolling out it won't be (52:46 - 52:50)
ready this year (52:49 - 52:51)
but we are working on a brand new (52:50 - 52:53)
worldwide version of ptcgo because (52:51 - 52:54)
remember (52:53 - 52:57)
japan doesn't have this at all and if (52:54 - 52:57)
japan is (52:57 - 53:02)
okay giving money to gotcha games (52:57 - 53:03)
they're very good at giving money to (53:02 - 53:06)
pokemon go i'm sure they would love (53:03 - 53:10)
a version of pt cgo (53:06 - 53:14)
for themselves so to like relaunch ptc (53:10 - 53:15)
whether that's next year or the year (53:14 - 53:17)
before have a way to import your card (53:15 - 53:18)
database which (53:17 - 53:21)
i can't imagine they they if they can (53:18 - 53:23)
figure out how to get a pokemon from gen (53:21 - 53:23)
3 (53:23 - 53:25)
to gen 8 i think they can figure out how (53:23 - 53:27)
to take your cards (53:25 - 53:30)
from ptc i will tell you the magic the (53:27 - 53:31)
gathering arena (53:30 - 53:33)
does not care what cards you own in real (53:31 - 53:34)
life they are (53:33 - 53:36)
separate things you can get some (53:34 - 53:38)
specialty packs that will say hey (53:36 - 53:40)
put in these codes and you'll get this a (53:38 - 53:42)
constructed deck (53:40 - 53:43)
and you can sometimes put in codes to (53:42 - 53:45)
get packs but they don't care what (53:43 - 53:47)
you've bought outside (53:45 - 53:49)
oh ptcgo doesn't carry either yeah yeah (53:47 - 53:51)
the code you get in a pack is different (53:49 - 53:52)
than the code you get in the game (53:51 - 53:54)
so there's a couple of things that we (53:52 - 53:56)
need to keep in mind one (53:54 - 54:00)
digital occupying games came under (53:56 - 54:03)
hyper focus because of (54:00 - 54:06)
the state of the world it is very clear (54:03 - 54:06)
that (54:06 - 54:10)
pokemon company was very much in this is (54:06 - 54:11)
an in person (54:10 - 54:14)
game right yeah like your tournaments (54:11 - 54:16)
are in person with physical cards (54:14 - 54:19)
we don't use electronics (54:16 - 54:22)
then 2020 happened and there's now (54:19 - 54:25)
a huge focus on maybe these large events (54:22 - 54:27)
can never happen again (54:25 - 54:30)
it takes time to develop an entire (54:27 - 54:31)
strategy (54:30 - 54:34)
to have those two concurrent programs (54:31 - 54:35)
running (54:34 - 54:38)
to give them equal weight it took magic (54:35 - 54:39)
two years to do it (54:38 - 54:42)
they're running tournaments online and (54:39 - 54:42)
in person (54:42 - 54:45)
but they are focused on that one (54:42 - 54:46)
specific (54:45 - 54:48)
product and getting it and it still took (54:46 - 54:50)
two years to get magic the gathering (54:48 - 54:52)
arena worthwhile (54:50 - 54:54)
and there are still bugs and still (54:52 - 54:56)
problems with card interactions (54:54 - 54:59)
because magic has a 25-year history (54:56 - 55:01)
they have to get all the cards in there (54:59 - 55:02)
and they have to figure out (55:01 - 55:05)
how things from 25 years ago worked now (55:02 - 55:08)
it's the same with pct but but actually (55:05 - 55:09)
actually (55:08 - 55:12)
in mtg arena they don't have all the (55:09 - 55:12)
cards (55:12 - 55:15)
ptcgo has a larger card database than (55:12 - 55:16)
mtg arena (55:15 - 55:19)
absolutely and i mean if they've added (55:16 - 55:20)
something because they're adding in (55:19 - 55:21)
historic so some are coming (55:20 - 55:25)
in but they do have a cut off so (55:21 - 55:28)
people there is a lot like what made me (55:25 - 55:29)
angry about this tweets is when there's (55:28 - 55:31)
like this level of (55:29 - 55:34)
belief that a company just doesn't want (55:31 - 55:35)
to put out good (55:34 - 55:37)
product the one thing that gets me (55:35 - 55:40)
through most work days and dealing with (55:37 - 55:43)
anybody is that knowledge that almost (55:40 - 55:45)
everybody ninety five percent of people (55:43 - 55:46)
come in to do (55:45 - 55:50)
a good job and try their best they (55:46 - 55:54)
don't want to have public embarrassment (55:50 - 55:57)
also you have to look at this wasn't a (55:54 - 55:58)
focus (55:57 - 56:01)
this hasn't been a focus until 2020 made (55:58 - 56:02)
it be a focus (56:01 - 56:04)
and if you're expecting them to suddenly (56:02 - 56:05)
say (56:04 - 56:09)
since march oh we're going to pump (56:05 - 56:12)
50 billion dollars into this product and (56:09 - 56:13)
get something (56:12 - 56:16)
up and working with every card from 10 (56:13 - 56:17)
years (56:16 - 56:19)
that also doesn't charge people money (56:17 - 56:20)
that fixes (56:19 - 56:22)
every issue and every card set works (56:20 - 56:24)
together you have no idea how the world (56:22 - 56:25)
works (56:24 - 56:28)
yeah well there you go i mean it's also (56:25 - 56:28)
like (56:28 - 56:30)
even if the pokemon company wanted to be (56:28 - 56:32)
like okay we're done with direwolf we (56:30 - 56:33)
need to go somewhere else (56:32 - 56:37)
like what big developer out there (56:33 - 56:39)
is going to be like oh yeah sure we're (56:37 - 56:41)
doing nothing right now let's go make (56:39 - 56:44)
this game (56:41 - 56:44)
like literally every big developer is (56:44 - 56:47)
probably (56:46 - 56:50)
a year or two years or five years into (56:47 - 56:52)
making a current game (56:50 - 56:55)
and even if they said yes you get in (56:52 - 56:55)
line (56:55 - 56:56)
because they're still working on (56:55 - 56:58)
something right like there's not a (56:56 - 56:59)
developer that's just sitting around (56:58 - 57:00)
being like man i wish somebody would (56:59 - 57:02)
drop a game in our lap (57:00 - 57:04)
yeah like that's just not how the world (57:02 - 57:06)
works and you could be like okay well (57:04 - 57:07)
then they should just do it themselves (57:06 - 57:11)
okay well hiring a manager hiring like (57:07 - 57:14)
40 developers hiring people to get those (57:11 - 57:16)
developers isn't something you just do (57:14 - 57:19)
in a month well you don't just like oh (57:16 - 57:20)
we're just going to cross (57:19 - 57:22)
chain these five people who are already (57:20 - 57:23)
working on a product (57:22 - 57:27)
every large corporation runs as close to (57:23 - 57:29)
the minimum amount of people you need on (57:27 - 57:31)
a project to save money (57:29 - 57:34)
as they can i have i'll say this in my (57:31 - 57:36)
own life i have (57:34 - 57:39)
eight call centers call centers of (57:36 - 57:42)
500 to a thousand people that i alone (57:39 - 57:43)
support (57:42 - 57:46)
and make training for and my team (57:43 - 57:49)
that does it worldwide is (57:46 - 57:53)
11 people and if all of us go out on (57:49 - 57:54)
vacation at the same (57:53 - 57:57)
time everything comes to a (57:54 - 58:00)
screeching halt because there is no (57:57 - 58:01)
extra they don't pay (58:00 - 58:05)
no company pays to have people who will (58:01 - 58:07)
only have a half day full of work (58:05 - 58:09)
who are sitting around in case something (58:07 - 58:10)
is needed (58:09 - 58:12)
they figure out the exact number that (58:10 - 58:13)
they need (58:12 - 58:16)
plus people taking vacation and sick (58:13 - 58:16)
time (58:16 - 58:20)
is not included in that and say (58:16 - 58:23)
this project will take 25 people to (58:20 - 58:26)
complete so we're going to give you 27 (58:23 - 58:26)
and (58:26 - 58:30)
that's it that's the budget and that was (58:26 - 58:30)
set (58:30 - 58:33)
january 1 we will re-look it and (58:30 - 58:35)
re-evaluate (58:33 - 58:37)
january 1 of next year and see how you (58:35 - 58:39)
did but you get no more (58:37 - 58:41)
there's no more and hope none of those (58:39 - 58:42)
people quit (58:41 - 58:44)
or leave because then you have to (58:42 - 58:46)
backfill and then ramp that person up (58:44 - 58:49)
that is such a delicate balance that (58:46 - 58:50)
they get for teams to work on these (58:49 - 58:53)
things and the numbers are so tight (58:50 - 58:55)
this notion that people are just sitting (58:53 - 58:56)
around with (58:55 - 58:59)
nothing to do in the company is (58:56 - 59:02)
not how how the world works (58:59 - 59:04)
the reason why people have extra staff (59:02 - 59:06)
in retail store is the idea that you are (59:04 - 59:09)
hanging around in case somebody comes in (59:06 - 59:11)
and if it's a slow season you all know (59:09 - 59:13)
your shifts get cut (59:11 - 59:16)
it's the same except we're salary (59:13 - 59:19)
and so they keep us or fire us i think (59:16 - 59:20)
there is (59:19 - 59:23)
value in making sure or (59:20 - 59:25)
hoping i think that i like whether we (59:23 - 59:27)
get a gen 4 remake whether we get gen 9 (59:25 - 59:28)
like those (59:27 - 59:30)
those things are like going to come (59:28 - 59:31)
eventually (59:30 - 59:34)
having a brand new version of ptcgo (59:31 - 59:37)
and have it designed to be able to do (59:34 - 59:38)
these tournaments which (59:37 - 59:40)
ptc geo is failing at right now which (59:38 - 59:42)
the pokemon company tried to make happen (59:40 - 59:44)
this year and they're continuing to try (59:42 - 59:45)
to make happen because it's all they (59:44 - 59:45)
have (59:45 - 59:48)
um i think that would be just so healthy (59:45 - 59:49)
and so (59:48 - 59:53)
positive and so good for people who love (59:49 - 59:55)
the pokemon trading card game and i (59:53 - 59:57)
think it would be good to get more (59:55 - 59:58)
people (59:57 - 60:00)
into the pokemon trading card game if (59:58 - 60:01)
there was an updated (60:00 - 60:04)
fresh app it would it would benefit (60:01 - 60:05)
current players (60:04 - 60:07)
it would benefit new players it would (60:05 - 60:08)
bring them money (60:07 - 60:10)
once they establish something that is (60:08 - 60:13)
good um and it would it would cause for (60:10 - 60:15)
healthy competition and i think maybe (60:13 - 60:17)
their worry was (60:15 - 60:19)
well if we do tournaments through ptcgo (60:17 - 60:21)
we won't do tournaments i (60:19 - 60:22)
that would push away from people coming (60:21 - 60:24)
to irl tournaments and i don't think (60:22 - 60:25)
that's the case (60:24 - 60:28)
i think that if i can if i cannot travel (60:25 - 60:31)
to x event but i can do x event here (60:28 - 60:34)
and i perform well it will incentivize (60:31 - 60:36)
me to want to travel (60:34 - 60:39)
in the future um i don't think i just (60:36 - 60:40)
don't think it takes away (60:39 - 60:42)
um and i'm sure that i'm sure magic (60:40 - 60:43)
slash hearthstone (60:42 - 60:46)
whatever hearthstone sorry i'm i'm sure (60:43 - 60:48)
they have also proven that like (60:46 - 60:50)
these digital events aren't taking away (60:48 - 60:52)
from their live events well there are no (60:50 - 60:53)
live events so who knows (60:52 - 60:55)
what's going on in the world anymore but (60:53 - 60:57)
maybe that's why ptc joe has been (60:55 - 61:00)
so poorly up kept for the last like year (60:57 - 61:01)
and a half is because they've put (61:00 - 61:03)
they're putting resources into something (61:01 - 61:04)
else (61:03 - 61:06)
i want to dream i want to i want to (61:04 - 61:07)
think that you want (61:06 - 61:10)
you want the hope to be alive it's (61:07 - 61:11)
probably (61:10 - 61:14)
like i think if anything this year (61:11 - 61:17)
has proven to every company that (61:14 - 61:18)
you don't know what's going to happen (61:17 - 61:21)
and it's really good to have a great (61:18 - 61:24)
online backup last bit of news here is (61:21 - 61:25)
uh (61:24 - 61:29)
the new series of (61:25 - 61:32)
uh pokemon journeys is on netflix we (61:29 - 61:35)
finally got the way to say the dragon (61:32 - 61:36)
type (61:35 - 61:38)
gym leaders i was wrong greg was wrong (61:36 - 61:42)
but together we were right (61:38 - 61:42)
take the first part of how greg thought (61:42 - 61:46)
it was in the last part of how i thought (61:44 - 61:47)
it was (61:46 - 61:49)
i mean the only way that i was wrong is (61:47 - 61:50)
they they (61:49 - 61:53)
overly pronounce the h in the middle you (61:50 - 61:54)
were very (61:53 - 61:56)
you were like oh it's ryan and i was (61:54 - 61:58)
like i don't think so (61:56 - 62:01)
right right right sorry (61:58 - 62:03)
yeah the last part is supposed to sound (62:01 - 62:05)
like hand right hand (62:03 - 62:08)
right hand right hand right hand no d (62:05 - 62:10)
why do you keep adding a d then i know (62:08 - 62:12)
it's like because i gotta think of hand (62:10 - 62:14)
when i say it look (62:12 - 62:17)
the mps education is creeping up on me i (62:14 - 62:18)
only i only jumped to the episode just (62:17 - 62:20)

not not on a pikachu because that would (64:41 - 64:44)
be terrible (64:42 - 64:48)
i you could you put on a hitmonlee (64:44 - 64:51)
you could you put on a glade but the (64:48 - 64:53)
guy's got that weird (64:51 - 64:55)
cape thing cape what's got also the (64:53 - 64:57)
weird belty middle (64:55 - 64:59)
like round disc in the middle that i (64:57 - 65:00)
don't really ever understand (64:59 - 65:03)
i want to find a way to reject this (65:00 - 65:06)
question completely (65:03 - 65:08)
and since i have recently discovered (65:06 - 65:10)
that i'm the queen of france i'm just (65:08 - 65:11)
going to say klefki (65:10 - 65:14)
klefke should be wearing a speedo there (65:11 - 65:15)
you go (65:14 - 65:17)
okay uh blaziken would probably look (65:15 - 65:18)
okay in the uh (65:17 - 65:23)
speedo slash belt meta (65:18 - 65:23)
needs a speedo and a belt a lich is a (65:31 - 65:35)
true champion (65:34 - 65:36)
i wonder how they're going to do halluci (65:35 - 65:38)
in pokemon go (65:36 - 65:41)
they're not this is another keklyan (65:38 - 65:44)
disaster wait what's the issue why can't (65:41 - 65:45)
they just (65:44 - 65:48)
have hot lucha and pokemon go yeah well (65:45 - 65:49)
i don't think there's any issue there (65:48 - 65:50)
the issue it doesn't (65:49 - 65:54)
evolve signature move it is quickly (65:50 - 65:56)
no the issue with keklian is like it (65:54 - 65:58)
would have to (65:56 - 66:00)
if you're it would have to copy the type (65:58 - 66:02)
in like the raid (66:00 - 66:03)
like mechanically it wouldn't work (66:02 - 66:05)
mechanically they would have make that (66:03 - 66:06)
work (66:05 - 66:07)
because keklian is normal type but if (66:06 - 66:09)
he's attacking (66:07 - 66:12)
like a kirum then he becomes i (66:09 - 66:15)
ice type ice type no i thought kecleon (66:12 - 66:16)
changed baseball (66:15 - 66:19)
on what move it move it wait move it (66:16 - 66:22)
it's it's getting hit by yeah hit by so (66:19 - 66:23)
if kiram's using ice moves it would turn (66:22 - 66:24)
ice (66:23 - 66:26)
which would then have to change its (66:24 - 66:27)
moves (66:26 - 66:29)
so that's the problem all right i have (66:27 - 66:31)
my final answer but i have the final (66:29 - 66:32)
answer about my pants oh no it's moves (66:31 - 66:34)
would be the same it's yeah it's just (66:32 - 66:35)
it's type of change (66:34 - 66:38)
yeah type of change yeah which is like (66:35 - 66:40)
changing super effective to not super (66:38 - 66:42)
effective yeah (66:40 - 66:44)
but it would never it would never get (66:42 - 66:45)
stabbed unless it somehow changes to a (66:44 - 66:47)
normal type (66:45 - 66:50)
anyways i'm putting a a bling belt (66:47 - 66:55)
and speedos on my sable eye final answer (66:50 - 66:57)
okay i'll give it to you i will give it (66:55 - 66:59)
to you you got it (66:57 - 67:01)
pokemon of the week well all right last (66:59 - 67:03)
week's pokemon super easy (67:01 - 67:06)
was based on trading card game cards uh (67:03 - 67:09)
only available in sword and sealed (67:06 - 67:09)
shield (67:09 - 67:12)
expansion there were actually two cards (67:09 - 67:14)
number 73 and 74. (67:12 - 67:17)
but in the japanese sets it's actually (67:14 - 67:18)
been available (67:17 - 67:22)
in four different sets technically (67:18 - 67:25)
both cards have 70 hp one has attacks (67:22 - 67:27)
that are bite and zap kick (67:25 - 67:31)
the other one has roar and static shock (67:27 - 67:34)
and uh it is a (67:31 - 67:37)
herding dog in the gala region as it (67:34 - 67:39)
runs it generates electricity from the (67:37 - 67:41)
base of its tail (67:39 - 67:44)
there you go greg cause i steve's (67:41 - 67:46)
completely confused right now (67:44 - 67:49)
it's (67:46 - 67:53)
pikachu it's the better pikachu (67:49 - 67:58)
it's yamper and this is (67:53 - 67:58)
so i can get my ball back yeah got a (68:00 - 68:06)
ball fetch yeah it's got that ball pitch (68:02 - 68:06)
yes and and you know they held off on (68:07 - 68:13)
printing any pikachu cards in the tcg (68:10 - 68:17)
until sorted (68:13 - 68:21)
[Laughter] (68:17 - 68:21)
did you know that his name may be a (68:21 - 68:25)
combination of a yam (68:23 - 68:29)
of yap ampere and scamper oh i like that (68:25 - 68:31)
i did not know that i like that its (68:29 - 68:32)
hidden ability is (68:31 - 68:36)
rattled it make it looks very thematic (68:32 - 68:39)
what does rattles do uh rattle is like (68:36 - 68:40)
it alerts you if there's a super (68:39 - 68:42)
effective move right (68:40 - 68:45)
no that's anticipation oh yeah yeah when (68:42 - 68:45)
a pokemon (68:45 - 68:48)
with the ability hits a bug dark ghost (68:45 - 68:49)
type (68:48 - 68:52)
speed will be increased by one stage uh (68:49 - 68:54)
with if the pokemon with this ability is (68:52 - 68:56)
hit by a (68:54 - 68:58)
bug ghost dark multi move it each will (68:56 - 69:00)
activate the ability (68:58 - 69:03)
and then generation 8 uh it is now (69:00 - 69:05)
activated by intimidate i actually (69:03 - 69:07)
didn't know that what yeah (69:05 - 69:10)
that was rattled a lot of people (69:07 - 69:14)
uh obviously uh dunsparce (69:10 - 69:16)
oh actually no i was like none of these (69:14 - 69:18)
pokemon matter like (69:16 - 69:19)
like alolan persian knows rattle but he (69:18 - 69:21)
would never run it because (69:19 - 69:24)
a little persian is already so fast (69:21 - 69:26)
pseudo-widow i guess but sudowoodo is (69:24 - 69:26)
really (69:26 - 69:30)
bad it's clam pearl no (69:26 - 69:34)
rattled it's it's hidden ability (69:30 - 69:35)
because it gets scared and hides in its (69:34 - 69:37)
shell and speeds up (69:35 - 69:41)
yeah i guess shiny does yeah (69:37 - 69:44)
it's really bad yeah i'm not a huge fan (69:41 - 69:45)
of (69:44 - 69:47)
what colors is it it's like instead of (69:45 - 69:48)
like being yellow it's like (69:47 - 69:51)
yellow pink yeah it's like it's just (69:48 - 69:52)
like a little bit (69:51 - 69:55)
lighter it's it's hard to see yeah (69:52 - 69:57)
because he's like tan (69:55 - 69:59)
yeah but his like shiny is like (69:57 - 70:01)
beige-ish (69:59 - 70:03)
it's like really hard to tell i had no (70:01 - 70:05)
shuffle icon unfortunately no no shuffle (70:03 - 70:05)
icon (70:05 - 70:08)
yet 25th anniversary coming though yeah (70:05 - 70:11)
exactly i'm very excited for this all (70:08 - 70:12)
right (70:11 - 70:14)
this week's pokemon it's gonna be a wild (70:12 - 70:17)
ride here we go in some ways (70:14 - 70:19)
it is amazing to scroll through the (70:17 - 70:21)
pokedex and see how many pokemon i have (70:19 - 70:24)
already covered as pokemon of the week (70:21 - 70:26)
in other ways it is quite distressing as (70:24 - 70:29)
they aren't churning out new pokemon (70:26 - 70:32)
in as much quantity as they used to i am (70:29 - 70:33)
feeling either (70:32 - 70:36)
get good scrubs or quit now for odds (70:33 - 70:38)
sometimes i like to pick a pokemon with (70:36 - 70:41)
either unique or very limited typing (70:38 - 70:42)
did you know that ice type has the (70:41 - 70:45)
fewest number of pokemon available (70:42 - 70:47)
they've pretty much run out of ice types (70:45 - 70:49)
though this week i'll do something more (70:47 - 70:51)
common but not as common as say (70:49 - 70:54)
water types the main thing that caught (70:51 - 70:54)
my (70:54 - 70:56)
eye about this week's pokemon wasn't (70:54 - 70:58)
that it can evolve into two pokemon (70:56 - 71:00)
simultaneously (70:58 - 71:01)
and it may be the only pokemon that can (71:00 - 71:04)
do this but that its main evolution (71:01 - 71:07)
the one it always evolves into has (71:04 - 71:08)
opposite (71:07 - 71:10)
typing from it i don't mean opposites (71:08 - 71:12)
like ice and fire but more opposites (71:10 - 71:14)
like this week's pokemon has stabbed (71:12 - 71:16)
for moves that would not hit its (71:14 - 71:18)
evolution at all (71:16 - 71:20)
we have another unique fact that both (71:18 - 71:21)
pokemon this week's evolves (71:20 - 71:24)
this week's evolves into do not (71:21 - 71:28)
inherit either of its possible abilities (71:24 - 71:31)
i guess in the end it's not slacking (71:28 - 71:34)
clan pearl there you go yeah yes clan (71:31 - 71:34)
pearl (71:34 - 71:38)
exactly because uh huntail and bra fish (71:34 - 71:39)
don't get rattled (71:38 - 71:43)
goribus don't have uh (71:39 - 71:43)
what is it uh shudder not shutter uh (71:43 - 71:46)
rattled (71:45 - 71:48)
rattled rattled all right well that's (71:46 - 71:50)
our episode (71:48 - 71:52)
uh wait i have a news update for (71:50 - 71:56)
everybody before you do the closing okay (71:52 - 71:56)
i have watched the my neighbor totoro (71:56 - 72:00)
dvd (71:59 - 72:03)
that movie is not good lies and i'm (72:00 - 72:05)
sending it back to netflix (72:03 - 72:07)
after a decade it's going back to (72:05 - 72:08)
netflix and then are you canceling your (72:07 - 72:09)
dvd (72:08 - 72:12)
yeah what's what's next i (72:09 - 72:15)
think i have some episodes of doctor who (72:12 - 72:16)
oh (72:15 - 72:18)
you need and i'm talking like the old (72:16 - 72:20)
doctor who not the not the 2000s doctor (72:18 - 72:21)
who (72:20 - 72:23)
i was actually i think the problem with (72:21 - 72:25)
totoro is people hype it up and then you (72:23 - 72:27)
watch it and you're like wow nothing (72:25 - 72:28)
happens (72:27 - 72:31)
exactly and then they're like (72:28 - 72:34)
look i've seen slice of life and (72:31 - 72:37)
they may have killed a little girl in it (72:34 - 72:38)
you don't know (72:37 - 72:42)
true slightly the ending is (72:38 - 72:45)
is is lovingly ambiguous (72:42 - 72:51)
yes i started re-watching death note (72:45 - 72:54)
so good that is a good anime yeah (72:51 - 72:57)
anyway did you ever finish brotherhood (72:54 - 72:57)
yeah (72:57 - 72:59)
i've watched brotherhood always okay (72:57 - 73:00)
this is me and anime (72:59 - 73:04)
like irene was like irene for it took (73:00 - 73:04)
her like (73:04 - 73:06)
three years to convince me to watch (73:04 - 73:07)
fullmetal (73:06 - 73:09)
because i was like the only anime in my (73:07 - 73:11)
life is (73:09 - 73:14)
digimon um and (73:11 - 73:16)
i watched fullmetal and i was like okay (73:14 - 73:18)
this is good i watched it all the way (73:16 - 73:19)
through (73:18 - 73:20)
and then i was like this ending to full (73:19 - 73:22)
metal is gonna be so bad (73:20 - 73:24)
and i'm gonna waste how many episodes of (73:22 - 73:25)
that (73:24 - 73:28)
and i'm gonna hate it and it had one of (73:25 - 73:29)
the best endings (73:28 - 73:31)
in any tv show i've ever seen and then (73:29 - 73:33)
she was like you need to watch death (73:31 - 73:35)
note now and i was like nah (73:33 - 73:36)
and i watched death note it was also (73:35 - 73:38)
good not as good as full metal but now (73:36 - 73:39)
she's like (73:38 - 73:41)
you should watch my hero and i was like (73:39 - 73:42)
is it better (73:41 - 73:46)
heck yeah is it better than full metal (73:42 - 73:47)
she's like it's different (73:46 - 73:49)
i was like why would i watch something (73:47 - 73:51)
really is different so my hero is more (73:49 - 73:52)
modern (73:51 - 73:54)
is is that and it has obviously a full (73:52 - 73:56)
metal alchemist is a (73:54 - 73:59)
15 year old intellectual property um (73:56 - 74:01)
but yeah my hero is my hero hasn't ended (73:59 - 74:03)
so you're not going to get an ending yet (74:01 - 74:03)
okay (74:03 - 74:06)
so i will not watch it i i need an (74:03 - 74:07)
ending what (74:06 - 74:10)
you watch it as it comes out because i (74:07 - 74:11)
have to watch okay (74:10 - 74:13)
so this is the other thing is i have to (74:11 - 74:14)
watch it in english (74:13 - 74:16)
and before anyone says well these (74:14 - 74:18)
licenses are better i don't care (74:16 - 74:21)
who's japanese or english voices better (74:18 - 74:23)
i'm not judging anyone on performance (74:21 - 74:23)
here (74:23 - 74:27)
i will say that my hero dub is good i (74:23 - 74:30)
am watching those i have to read (74:27 - 74:33)
like 18 hours a day twitch chat and (74:30 - 74:36)
that's a lot of garbage i gotta hurry (74:33 - 74:38)
so when i'm done reading twitch chat i (74:36 - 74:40)
do not want to sit on my couch (74:38 - 74:42)
and put my feet up and i have a cat in (74:40 - 74:44)
my lap and do more reading (74:42 - 74:46)
i just i'm i'm i'm brain dead at that (74:44 - 74:48)
point and i just want to (74:46 - 74:51)
watch i want to consume i don't want to (74:48 - 74:52)
read (74:51 - 74:56)
i just want to veg out in the very few (74:52 - 74:59)
moments i have in life to watch tv (74:56 - 75:00)
all right well then i guess you need to (74:59 - 75:03)
watch uh attack on titan is it is that (75:00 - 75:04)
over (75:03 - 75:06)
or do we still have one more season i (75:04 - 75:07)
think there's one more season (75:06 - 75:09)
look i only made it through season one (75:07 - 75:10)
and i couldn't do season two and i have (75:09 - 75:11)
not kept up (75:10 - 75:14)
oh it gets so much better that's the one (75:11 - 75:15)
that i think i'm gonna wait until it's (75:14 - 75:16)
done and then just (75:15 - 75:19)
binge it i need stuff to be done but why (75:16 - 75:20)
would i watch something new and i could (75:19 - 75:22)
just re-watch full metal (75:20 - 75:25)
because it's new i don't know i like i (75:22 - 75:26)
don't know (75:25 - 75:29)
full metal true i'm not watching the (75:26 - 75:30)
other full metal (75:29 - 75:31)
i looked at the ending and i was like (75:30 - 75:34)
that ending is bad i like already (75:31 - 75:36)
that drew convinced me to watch the (75:34 - 75:38)
newest naruto knockoff (75:36 - 75:42)
and i'm i'm still deciding if (75:38 - 75:46)
