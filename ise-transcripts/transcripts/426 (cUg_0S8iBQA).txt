the flavor is miami cola and it's awful (1:47 - 1:52)
it has so much like potential it's like (1:53 - 2:00)
a little like coconut coke (1:56 - 2:02)
right or maybe like a little pineapple (2:00 - 2:04)
coke or something no no no no (2:02 - 2:08)

two back support chairs for my two (2:28 - 2:35)
offices is it uh very nice offices (2:32 - 2:38)
swanky yeah well one's my work office (2:35 - 2:38)
and then (2:38 - 2:40)
this well i mean i'm calling this an (2:38 - 2:42)
office because there's not a bed in here (2:40 - 2:44)
otherwise it would be a bedroom did you (2:42 - 2:47)

eighteen dollars (2:55 - 3:01)
good enough yeah it's easy enough to sit (2:57 - 3:01)
on (3:01 - 3:04)
yeah actually though i bought so i had (3:01 - 3:06)
bought this style of chair (3:04 - 3:08)
when i was working from home because the (3:06 - 3:09)
one chair that i had that was (3:08 - 3:11)
20 years old was cutting the circulation (3:09 - 3:12)
off to my legs (3:11 - 3:15)
so i bought it thinking well this is a (3:12 - 3:16)
temporary feeling (3:15 - 3:19)
until i return to the office oh ho ho ho (3:16 - 3:20)
i'm not (3:19 - 3:22)
because that's where my 800 chair is (3:20 - 3:23)
that i (3:22 - 3:25)
cannot take from the office uh so i (3:23 - 3:27)
bought it and actually really really (3:25 - 3:27)
liked it (3:27 - 3:30)
uh so when i split the two rooms finally (3:27 - 3:32)
i'm like i'll just buy that chair again (3:30 - 3:35)
only this time i'm buying it in blue (3:32 - 3:37)
instead of black (3:35 - 3:40)
fancy and it's quite good i mean i don't (3:37 - 3:41)
you know (3:40 - 3:43)
i'm not in front of a camera for eight (3:41 - 3:44)

other people (4:08 - 4:10)

out of the way pretty short (5:56 - 6:00)
uh the anniversary event still going (5:58 - 6:02)
until the end of the month september (6:00 - 6:03)
30th (6:02 - 6:05)
so you can still get your chance of (6:03 - 6:06)
getting blue (6:05 - 6:10)
or red or leaf sigma suit versions (6:06 - 6:12)
uh of those characters are still (6:10 - 6:13)
available in (6:12 - 6:15)
uh banners that's what they're called (6:13 - 6:17)
right banners yep (6:15 - 6:20)
this past week they just announced the (6:17 - 6:23)
story event family ties which i have not (6:20 - 6:24)
done yet (6:23 - 6:27)
i have i'm still working through my eggs (6:24 - 6:28)
but (6:27 - 6:31)
oh yeah i haven't done it yet either i (6:28 - 6:31)
have (6:31 - 6:34)
i have feelings about it but they've (6:31 - 6:35)
introduced uh (6:34 - 6:38)
lusamine and lily and gladion (6:35 - 6:40)
all as characters that you can actually (6:38 - 6:42)
pull on and get (6:40 - 6:44)
i think there were rumors or speculation (6:42 - 6:46)
that only lily would be available with (6:44 - 6:47)
clevery because she was in the trailer (6:46 - 6:48)
with clefairy (6:47 - 6:52)
but all characters are obtainable (6:48 - 6:54)
uh but they are they yes they're just (6:52 - 6:55)
doing um (6:54 - 6:57)
so lily is right or sorry lucy means (6:55 - 6:59)
right now and then i think on monday is (6:57 - 7:01)
lily and then like two days after lily's (6:59 - 7:03)
gladion so they're just spacing him out (7:01 - 7:04)
a little bit (7:03 - 7:07)
so of all the pokemon that i (7:04 - 7:09)
associate with lily which is two (7:07 - 7:11)
clefairy is not one of those two (7:09 - 7:13)
yeah what where did that come from she (7:11 - 7:15)
has a clefairy in her (7:13 - 7:18)
team inside the moon she has a team (7:15 - 7:21)
yeah because yeah she like gets all (7:18 - 7:23)
happy she becomes a trainer and (7:21 - 7:25)
she's like ready to battle and stuff and (7:23 - 7:27)
boy i don't remember any of that i just (7:25 - 7:28)
remember (7:27 - 7:31)
getting the bag and then on (7:28 - 7:34)
in the anime she had a in the lowland (7:31 - 7:35)
vulpix (7:34 - 7:37)
yes and the anime she had the vulpix uh (7:35 - 7:39)
i don't know if she had any more pokemon (7:37 - 7:40)
in the anime (7:39 - 7:42)
uh in i never finished it so i don't (7:40 - 7:44)
know yeah i never finished the anime (7:42 - 7:48)
in in the manga she had a cutie fly (7:44 - 7:51)
well i i would take a cutie fly yeah (7:48 - 7:56)
in cosmic eclipse she had a clefairy (7:51 - 7:58)
she had it at one point in the games (7:56 - 8:00)
like there's one clefairy she uses and i (7:58 - 8:02)
don't remember (8:00 - 8:04)
where i think it's ultra sun alternate i (8:02 - 8:05)
mean it's clear that they're using (8:04 - 8:07)
ultrasound ultra moon versions of all (8:05 - 8:10)
these characters for the storyline (8:07 - 8:11)
well yeah because it's just like star (8:10 - 8:13)
trek where they erase the whole (8:11 - 8:14)
like original sun and moon and they're (8:13 - 8:16)
like no no no don't look over there look (8:14 - 8:18)
at this new one (8:16 - 8:21)
i mean i will say spoiler alert (8:18 - 8:25)
spoiler alert they do at least touch on (8:21 - 8:27)
what a terrible mother listening is oh (8:25 - 8:29)
okay they do in the story (8:27 - 8:32)
yeah uh they it's it's definitely the (8:29 - 8:34)
ultrasound ultramoon (8:32 - 8:37)
uh bad mom light that was in those (8:34 - 8:39)
stories instead of bad mom (8:37 - 8:41)
regular which was on the moon but yeah (8:39 - 8:42)
there's (8:41 - 8:45)
a lot of the story is how bad lusamine (8:42 - 8:46)
was (8:45 - 8:50)
and they do have a guzma and lusamine (8:46 - 8:53)
uh cutscene of those two meeting again (8:50 - 8:55)
which was kind of cool (8:53 - 8:56)
because that there's all tents as they (8:55 - 8:59)
were like oh it's you (8:56 - 9:01)
how did you get here see the nice thing (8:59 - 9:02)
about masters is we can (9:01 - 9:04)
even if you don't even if you don't play (9:02 - 9:06)
masters you can at least listen to us (9:04 - 9:07)
argue about what characters should have (9:06 - 9:08)
which pokemon (9:07 - 9:11)
for the next 10 minutes in ultrasound (9:08 - 9:12)
ultra moon (9:11 - 9:14)
lily does have a clefairy it is kept in (9:12 - 9:17)
a heal ball and when you do a multi (9:14 - 9:18)
battle so when you and her battle (9:17 - 9:20)
together in the aether paradise (9:18 - 9:23)
she does send out clefairy and then when (9:20 - 9:24)
you (9:23 - 9:27)
if she is in the battle tree and she is (9:24 - 9:29)
your partner in the battle tree (9:27 - 9:32)
she will use rabombi or comfey (9:29 - 9:35)
as her two pokemon so that was her only (9:32 - 9:35)
pokemon (9:35 - 9:38)
besides cosmog (9:35 - 9:42)
that she has in the games so accurate i (9:38 - 9:42)
guess (9:42 - 9:45)
is is what that is (9:42 - 9:46)
i thought will you were going to (9:45 - 9:49)
complain about lusa means (9:46 - 9:51)
sink pair which i don't understand these (9:49 - 9:52)
complaints either (9:51 - 9:55)
is it not the jellyfish ultra beast it (9:52 - 9:55)
is not (9:55 - 9:57)
no it's the cockroach shelter beast yeah (9:55 - 9:59)
that's the one that she's based on (9:57 - 10:01)
exactly that looks like her right so (9:59 - 10:03)
lusamine has (10:01 - 10:06)
ferramosa and people were upset that she (10:03 - 10:07)
doesn't have (10:06 - 10:10)
nile ego but like like the (10:07 - 10:12)
eight months prior to sun and moon (10:10 - 10:13)
coming out everyone was (10:12 - 10:19)
like oh lucimine and pheramosa right (10:13 - 10:22)
it's the one that looks like her yeah i (10:19 - 10:22)
mean (10:22 - 10:26)
to be fair i mean it's not uh (10:22 - 10:29)
it's not illegal that like takes her (10:26 - 10:32)
takes over her body so i can kind of see (10:29 - 10:35)
yeah that but like isn't the fan theory (10:32 - 10:36)
though (10:35 - 10:39)
the reason niall ego looks like lily (10:36 - 10:42)
is because lusa mean dresses up lily to (10:39 - 10:44)
look like nyligo and that's like one (10:42 - 10:47)
throwaway line that lily says of like (10:44 - 10:49)
this is the first time i dressed myself (10:47 - 10:52)
my mom normally dresses me (10:49 - 10:54)
oh there's a whole cutscene about lucia (10:52 - 10:55)
mean (10:54 - 10:59)
freaking out about lily going shopping (10:55 - 11:01)
in in masters (10:59 - 11:04)
which is kind of funny (11:01 - 11:04)
i don't have a problem with loose being (11:04 - 11:07)
using feramosa (11:05 - 11:10)
no i think it's yeah i think it's fine i (11:07 - 11:11)
think (11:10 - 11:12)
as well because they gave her these (11:11 - 11:14)
that's good it's the one that looks like (11:12 - 11:14)
her (11:14 - 11:16)
yeah right like wait which which ultra (11:14 - 11:19)
beast does gladion look like (11:16 - 11:23)
i don't think people uh associated (11:19 - 11:24)
gladion (11:23 - 11:27)
with an ultra beast no he looks he's got (11:24 - 11:29)
the same spiky hair as (11:27 - 11:32)
savalai yeah well because yeah well (11:29 - 11:33)
savala is like the (11:32 - 11:37)
ultra what was it you ba i'll you be (11:33 - 11:40)
you be k ultra beast killer is that (11:37 - 11:43)
there's no killing in pokemon (11:40 - 11:45)
oh they do also touch on the fact that (11:43 - 11:47)
lucy means walking around with an ultra (11:45 - 11:49)
beast in the masters (11:47 - 11:51)
a whole slew of people are like excuse (11:49 - 11:53)
me (11:51 - 11:55)
uh we're gonna have to kill that thing (11:53 - 11:57)
they could always do uh cigna suit (11:55 - 11:58)
loosamine and (11:57 - 12:02)
give her nighly god i guess (11:58 - 12:05)
because at one point like there's zero (12:02 - 12:06)
other characters in the masters (12:05 - 12:08)
or in the pokemon universe that would (12:06 - 12:09)
get nile ego (12:08 - 12:12)
yeah i don't know where what else you (12:09 - 12:14)
would do (12:12 - 12:17)
uh i mean if you wanted to do like (12:14 - 12:20)
more ultra beasts you could have the the (12:17 - 12:21)
island (12:20 - 12:24)
like captains because they all had to (12:21 - 12:24)
fight the (12:24 - 12:27)
ultra beasts that came to their islands (12:24 - 12:30)
yeah they touched on that a little bit (12:27 - 12:33)
in the game there's a couple of guys (12:30 - 12:34)
there (12:33 - 12:36)
in depth yeah there's a bunch of scenes (12:34 - 12:38)
that really play off but (12:36 - 12:41)
the thing that i like most about the (12:38 - 12:42)
secondary storyline so (12:41 - 12:46)
the main storyline is pretty standard um (12:42 - 12:48)
and it you know it does that sort of (12:46 - 12:49)
anime (12:48 - 12:52)
of we have 10 minutes to resolve all (12:49 - 12:53)
this conflict and they take that 10 (12:52 - 12:54)
minutes and then they resolve the (12:53 - 12:55)
conflict (12:54 - 12:58)
um but the scenes after that you have to (12:55 - 13:00)
get through the events (12:58 - 13:03)
um touch on a lot of things that (13:00 - 13:05)
honestly if you're following the series (13:03 - 13:07)
you're like wouldn't so and so and so (13:05 - 13:09)
and so be kind of upset about this (13:07 - 13:10)
and then there's a scene about those (13:09 - 13:13)
people sort of approaching lusamine or (13:10 - 13:14)
the kids and being like (13:13 - 13:17)
you know this isn't great uh and then (13:14 - 13:18)
talking through that so they do (13:17 - 13:21)
they do a pretty good job of dealing (13:18 - 13:22)
with (13:21 - 13:25)
the problems of that family being (13:22 - 13:25)
together (13:25 - 13:29)
again and everybody that lusamine (13:25 - 13:32)
hurt uh has a little bit of a time to (13:29 - 13:33)
like deal with lisa means so (13:32 - 13:35)
they do they do a pretty good job at (13:33 - 13:36)
masters i think (13:35 - 13:38)
if we're looking at lusa means pokemon (13:36 - 13:40)
in the manga (13:38 - 13:43)
she has all the same as in sun and moon (13:40 - 13:43)
but she (13:43 - 13:47)
also apparently in the manga catches (13:43 - 13:47)
how do we say this neganda dell (13:47 - 13:51)
naganadal (13:50 - 13:54)
that's it naga natal like that that's it (13:51 - 13:56)
she catches a noggle nadal she catches (13:54 - 13:58)
nyligo and she catches celestila (13:56 - 14:02)
in the manga oh really (13:58 - 14:03)
how many ultra beasts are in sword and (14:02 - 14:05)
shield (14:03 - 14:08)
zero yeah (14:05 - 14:08)
exactly none until the dlc (14:08 - 14:14)
yeah i don't think all the other ultra (14:12 - 14:17)
beasts were shown in the trailer (14:14 - 14:19)
it's a surprise where the top of the (14:17 - 14:21)
showed in the trailer they're pretty (14:19 - 14:21)
sure they're coming (14:21 - 14:23)
yeah they were yeah we there was a huge (14:21 - 14:25)
argument about that because (14:23 - 14:28)
i'm on my twitch stream because because (14:25 - 14:30)
we were talking about how rilaboom was (14:28 - 14:31)
so dominant (14:30 - 14:34)
with grassy glide and i was like well if (14:31 - 14:34)
they keep it (14:34 - 14:36)
you know it probably won't be as (14:34 - 14:38)
dominant once they roll out like (14:36 - 14:39)
tapulele or (14:38 - 14:42)
tapu coco because they'll set up terrain (14:39 - 14:43)
right away (14:42 - 14:46)
and then somebody was like no that's a (14:43 - 14:47)
spoiler don't (14:46 - 14:49)
don't spoil it for me and i was like i'm (14:47 - 14:51)
pretty sure they were in the trailer (14:49 - 14:53)
and then they were like i don't remember (14:51 - 14:54)
and i was like i'm gonna pull up the (14:53 - 14:55)
official trailer (14:54 - 14:57)
and sure enough the tapus are in the (14:55 - 14:58)
trailer so (14:57 - 15:00)
but when chrysler can get more dominant (14:58 - 15:02)
because top of bulu puts down (15:00 - 15:05)
grassy terrain no because real boom puts (15:02 - 15:06)
down grassy train (15:05 - 15:09)
oh when it comes out yeah oh okay oh (15:06 - 15:12)
that's right hidden ability yeah (15:09 - 15:16)
very good i need to do some of that (15:12 - 15:17)
some of that work so taboos are for sure (15:16 - 15:20)
coming the trailer did not show ultra (15:17 - 15:21)
beasts (15:20 - 15:23)
so i don't know uh i don't know what (15:21 - 15:24)
that is october surprise (15:23 - 15:27)
we'll see it uh the last character is (15:24 - 15:29)

cautious about gem spending uh they did (15:49 - 15:53)
say there will be (15:52 - 15:55)
holiday sink pairs in october and (15:53 - 15:57)

that's what i did uh speaking of (17:53 - 18:00)
characters in the pokemon universe (17:57 - 18:04)
there is the gym leader elisa (18:00 - 18:08)
and skyla kotobukiyai (18:04 - 18:10)
figures i don't know what that word (18:08 - 18:13)
means uh that are on the pokemon center (18:10 - 18:17)
they are two of unova's most popular and (18:13 - 18:19)
memorable gym leaders do you agree with (18:17 - 18:20)
this will (18:19 - 18:23)
out of the eight they are two of them (18:20 - 18:26)
[Laughter] (18:23 - 18:27)
[Music] (18:26 - 18:29)
yes i mean they're they're certainly (18:27 - 18:32)
not the most forgettable of the gym (18:29 - 18:33)
leaders in unova so (18:32 - 18:36)
uh who's morphe berg and clay are pretty (18:33 - 18:38)
forgettable right (18:36 - 18:41)
yes yeah marlin is pretty forgettable i (18:38 - 18:42)
think (18:41 - 18:46)
if marlin should never have happened (18:42 - 18:46)
bryce bryson man bryson is amazing i (18:47 - 18:50)
will hear (18:50 - 18:54)
nothing against bryson (18:50 - 18:58)
yeah no bryson turned his back (18:54 - 19:00)
on being a gym leader no no no no he (18:58 - 19:02)
wanted to pursue (19:00 - 19:04)
what dwayne the rock johnson was you (19:02 - 19:05)
wanted anything right (19:04 - 19:08)
he did not have a true passion for being (19:05 - 19:10)
a pokemon gym leader (19:08 - 19:12)
and he should never have dabbled in (19:10 - 19:14)
those arts if he wasn't (19:12 - 19:17)
ready to commit he (19:14 - 19:20)
met the pinnacle of his gym career (19:17 - 19:23)
by picking ice he saw the path forward (19:20 - 19:25)
and said you know what (19:23 - 19:27)
i'm gonna go act your favorite pokemon (19:25 - 19:30)
isn't even an ice type pokemon (19:27 - 19:34)
right but like i'm sure he was tired of (19:30 - 19:35)
like hi (19:34 - 19:36)
everybody ruins my gym because ice has (19:35 - 19:38)
the most weaknesses (19:36 - 19:41)
i'm gonna go act yeah i just think (19:38 - 19:43)
all all of the ice type gym leaders have (19:41 - 19:44)
been pretty (19:43 - 19:46)
bottom of the barrel i think that's a (19:44 - 19:48)
nice way to put it right there (19:46 - 19:52)
are you speaking ill of candace uh (19:48 - 19:52)
mostly (19:52 - 19:54)
wolf rick what about price (19:52 - 19:56)
[Music] (19:54 - 19:58)

so yeah melanie is amazing (20:08 - 20:15)
hands down best ice gym leader posed (20:12 - 20:18)
strikingly on a pokeball base nambasa (20:15 - 20:20)
gym leader elisa and her partner pokemon (20:18 - 20:23)
imonga imoga amp up the drama (20:20 - 20:25)
of any pokemon collection this gym (20:23 - 20:27)
leader model is surrounded by (20:25 - 20:30)
lightning as befitting a trainer who (20:27 - 20:32)
works with electric type pokemon a moga (20:30 - 20:34)
rests on the sleeve of its trainer's (20:32 - 20:35)
jacket (20:34 - 20:37)
ready to spring into action when a (20:35 - 20:39)
challenger appears (20:37 - 20:41)
miss stralton i don't know how to say (20:39 - 20:44)
these yeah mr alton mr alton city (20:41 - 20:46)
the stralton city's gym leader skyla is (20:44 - 20:47)
poised (20:46 - 20:50)
for a fight or flight or battle with her (20:47 - 20:52)
partner pokemon swanna on her back (20:50 - 20:56)
skyla is a breath of fresh air a gust of (20:52 - 20:58)
wind beneath her feet and arms (20:56 - 20:59)
outstretched (20:58 - 21:02)
as i feel like i'm reading a pbs ad for (20:59 - 21:02)
like an (21:02 - 21:06)
auction right now and at the 40 (21:02 - 21:10)
level you'll get a tote bag uh ready to (21:06 - 21:13)
fight captures skyla's affinity for the (21:10 - 21:15)
air as indicated by her career as a (21:13 - 21:17)
pilot and the fact that she specializes (21:15 - 21:20)
in training flying type pokemon (21:17 - 21:21)
both figures are exclusive to pokemon (21:20 - 21:23)
center and for fans (21:21 - 21:27)
seeking premium statues to showcase (21:23 - 21:29)
their love of the pokemon world (21:27 - 21:32)
that is not me i am not seeking any (21:29 - 21:33)
premium statues ever (21:32 - 21:37)
you don't want to spend 129 on these (21:33 - 21:40)

know (21:53 - 21:56)
i've moved on to the other thing oh i (21:54 - 21:58)

elisa is is sold out i think she's gone (21:58 - 22:03)
i do not see her anymore (22:01 - 22:05)
skyla still there i was gonna ask which (22:03 - 22:07)
one is more popular skyla or lisa but i (22:05 - 22:09)
think we already got our answer i think (22:07 - 22:10)
we've got that answer (22:09 - 22:12)
they're both still on the website oh (22:10 - 22:14)
okay they are they are there (22:12 - 22:15)
they just weren't next to each other i (22:14 - 22:17)
was worried (22:15 - 22:19)
i mean is it a full art skyla because (22:17 - 22:21)
full art skyla is going to run you a (22:19 - 22:23)
pretty penny (22:21 - 22:26)
yeah it's full it's fuller was there (22:23 - 22:28)
ever a full art elisa (22:26 - 22:29)
was there even there had to have been an (22:28 - 22:31)
elisa supporter card (22:29 - 22:35)
i don't think there was wow (22:31 - 22:37)
i mean both the figures are really great (22:35 - 22:39)
like they're very cool looking i (22:37 - 22:41)
don't want to spend 130 to have more (22:39 - 22:42)
junk in my house (22:41 - 22:46)
yeah i just can't like the whole (22:42 - 22:50)
haunted village thing nope spoilers (22:46 - 22:54)
i said this on stream i feel like like (22:50 - 22:56)
the like if i was ever to go down the (22:54 - 22:57)
path of (22:56 - 23:00)
100 plus figures it would have to be at (22:57 - 23:02)
like a convention it would have to be (23:00 - 23:05)
like there's one left the guy the guy is (23:02 - 23:06)
there like you know (23:05 - 23:09)
you know buddy for you i'm gonna knock (23:06 - 23:10)
10 (23:09 - 23:12)
off the price you know these are 129 i (23:10 - 23:14)
got one left i want to move it (23:12 - 23:15)
i'll give you a discount and then you (23:14 - 23:17)
barter a little bit more you get them to (23:15 - 23:18)
knock off like 20. (23:17 - 23:20)
and then you're like well i've already (23:18 - 23:22)
been sitting here for 20 minutes looking (23:20 - 23:23)
at it and arguing with you (23:22 - 23:26)
my here's my credit card like that's the (23:23 - 23:28)
only situation i feel like i could buy (23:26 - 23:32)
a 100 figure but like you are (23:28 - 23:35)
such a sucker like because what you're (23:32 - 23:37)
saying is what you're saying is in order (23:35 - 23:39)
for me to buy this (23:37 - 23:41)
i want somebody to actively lie to me (23:39 - 23:42)
about the rarity (23:41 - 23:46)
and the price so that i feel like i'm (23:42 - 23:49)
winning in a in in this transaction so (23:46 - 23:51)
that when you leave he pops another one (23:49 - 23:52)
out (23:51 - 23:54)
and says oh this is the last one you (23:52 - 23:56)
should have seen this guy who left who (23:54 - 23:58)
was gonna buy it but didn't (23:56 - 24:00)
and then you go on ebay and see like (23:58 - 24:01)
they're selling him for four dollars (24:00 - 24:02)
each (24:01 - 24:05)
like you're just straight up saying hey (24:02 - 24:06)
everybody (24:05 - 24:08)
as long as you tell me a good story and (24:06 - 24:10)
say that you're giving me a discount (24:08 - 24:12)
i'm gonna buy it it's the thrill it's (24:10 - 24:13)
the thrill of the hunt but the hottest (24:12 - 24:16)
the hunt is the deal it's the thrill of (24:13 - 24:18)
being lied to (24:16 - 24:21)
i just i don't i what do you do with (24:18 - 24:22)
these things (24:21 - 24:24)
you there's nothing that you can do with (24:22 - 24:26)
them it's not like it's like (24:24 - 24:27)
easter comes around you're like oh let (24:26 - 24:30)
me display my elisa figurines (24:27 - 24:34)

oh i'm gonna go on a flight i need to (24:40 - 24:44)
bring my lucky skyla (24:42 - 24:45)
i mean i can imagine if you're an (24:44 - 24:48)
internationally famous twitch streamer (24:45 - 24:49)
then there's like (24:48 - 24:53)
you you want to have some background (24:49 - 24:55)
but in me and my home where i don't even (24:53 - 24:57)

uh you know there's nothing to look at (24:57 - 25:03)
here except some white walls (25:00 - 25:04)
that's because you don't have figurines (25:03 - 25:07)
around your house i don't want figurines (25:04 - 25:09)
yeah not with that attitude if i was (25:07 - 25:11)

for two years now forty dollars a (27:10 - 27:15)
haunted village is expensive (27:13 - 27:18)
yeah well so is it though because if you (27:15 - 27:19)
go to michael's (27:18 - 27:21)
like their haunted village of of (27:19 - 27:22)
nothingness (27:21 - 27:24)
they don't have like a fee while their (27:22 - 27:26)
theme is spooky but they don't have like (27:24 - 27:26)
a (27:26 - 27:29)
brand attached to it but wait you said (27:26 - 27:31)
it's misleading to say 40 (27:29 - 27:33)
for the haunted village because it's 160 (27:31 - 27:35)
to get all four right right right (27:33 - 27:37)
forty dollars you can't just have one (27:35 - 27:38)
you can't just have miss (27:37 - 27:41)
mages i've been so horrors we're gonna (27:38 - 27:43)
talk about (27:41 - 27:47)
the spooky village uh the limex spooky (27:43 - 27:48)
village at (27:47 - 27:51)
michaels is that not wait is that brand (27:48 - 27:51)
named (27:51 - 27:54)
well yeah that's what it is spooky town (27:51 - 27:56)
is there not like competitive (27:54 - 27:57)
competitors (27:56 - 28:00)
for spooky town i don't think so (27:57 - 28:01)
i mean you said michaels i'm on (28:00 - 28:03)
michael's there is exactly one spooky (28:01 - 28:04)
town (28:03 - 28:06)
okay that i'm finding all right well and (28:04 - 28:08)
they vary in price depending on the size (28:06 - 28:11)
right well yeah because for for the (28:08 - 28:12)
michael stuff you could get like (28:11 - 28:15)
a a windmill or like a silo or just like (28:12 - 28:16)
a a (28:15 - 28:19)
wagon but there are bigger buildings so (28:16 - 28:21)
we have to compare the buildings to the (28:19 - 28:22)
building (28:21 - 28:24)
also they're made out of porcelain and (28:22 - 28:26)
not cheap plastic (28:24 - 28:30)
ah there you go they also light up (28:26 - 28:32)
and are not made out of a cheap plastic (28:30 - 28:34)
which is the problem when i bought that (28:32 - 28:36)
first train and i'm like oh (28:34 - 28:38)
it's just cheap plastic and i'm paying (28:36 - 28:41)
40 for this (28:38 - 28:43)
nope is the train plastic i thought the (28:41 - 28:44)
train was like a (28:43 - 28:46)
porcelain it's like no it's not (28:44 - 28:49)
porcelain it's definitely that resin (28:46 - 28:52)
porcelain yeah it's not plastic plastic (28:49 - 28:53)
though is plastic resin are they the (28:52 - 28:54)
same yes they're pretty (28:53 - 28:57)
they're uh they're in the same family (28:54 - 28:58)
polly resin (28:57 - 29:01)
is what this uh haunted house on pokemon (28:58 - 29:02)
center dot com says yes (29:01 - 29:04)
now that you say they don't light up (29:02 - 29:06)
that's probably why i'm not pulling the (29:04 - 29:07)
trigger (29:06 - 29:09)
if i'm getting something spooky oh yeah (29:07 - 29:10)
it's gotta have like (29:09 - 29:12)
flash you're not flashing lights but (29:10 - 29:14)
glowing lights yeah yeah (29:12 - 29:16)
160 dollars for the whole set i think i (29:14 - 29:17)
would gosh my limit would probably be (29:16 - 29:18)
100 (29:17 - 29:21)
for four items but 25 would probably (29:18 - 29:23)
so how much is a building for spooky (29:21 - 29:24)
town okay (29:23 - 29:29)
so the same size well slightly bigger (29:24 - 29:30)
than what you're probably getting for (29:29 - 29:33)
these the lemax spooky town zombie jazz (29:30 - 29:35)
cafe that lights up (29:33 - 29:38)
is 35.99 the pokemon tax gets (29:35 - 29:42)
gets you again their spooky uh (29:38 - 29:45)
spooky town frightful flea feline choir (29:42 - 29:47)
which is smaller (29:45 - 29:50)
is 29.99 it is out of porcelain (29:47 - 29:53)
but there's no lights on that one the (29:50 - 29:54)
spooky town black raven (29:53 - 29:58)
manor which has uh looks like lights (29:54 - 30:01)
and sound and flying bats and ravens (29:58 - 30:04)
around the top (30:01 - 30:08)
is 71.99 yeah uh spooky town's hideous (30:04 - 30:10)
harry's toy factory (30:08 - 30:13)
oh this is an abomination (30:10 - 30:17)
no it has everything included it is (30:13 - 30:19)
89.99 but (30:17 - 30:21)
i would not have this in my home this is (30:19 - 30:22)
this is horrible (30:21 - 30:26)
well it is supposed to be spooky i mean (30:22 - 30:29)
valid but i would not walk into the room (30:26 - 30:31)
that that thing was in (30:29 - 30:34)
oh it's the clown yep not into it i'm (30:31 - 30:35)
out (30:34 - 30:37)
it looks much it looks like the finer (30:35 - 30:39)
details are (30:37 - 30:43)
more good compared to the pokemon ones (30:39 - 30:46)
yeah this is a quality product (30:43 - 30:49)
except for the clowns these are the (30:46 - 30:50)
clown entrance and the scary bears out (30:49 - 30:51)
front (30:50 - 30:53)
oh classic michael's thing they they (30:51 - 30:55)
always like try to tell you it's on sale (30:53 - 30:57)
even though you'll never you'll never (30:55 - 30:59)
find it at 150 (30:57 - 31:02)
you just sat at a convention center if (30:59 - 31:04)
somebody did the accepting (31:02 - 31:06)
you would buy it yeah but i know what (31:04 - 31:11)
the price of the lisa is it's 129. (31:06 - 31:11)
yeah if they lit up i would be more (31:16 - 31:20)
willing to pay the 40 bucks (31:19 - 31:22)
but now that you've mentioned they don't (31:20 - 31:26)
they don't glow they don't do anything (31:22 - 31:28)
i think i'm out of poly resin which i (31:26 - 31:30)
don't even know what that is (31:28 - 31:32)
it does say limit of two which the train (31:30 - 31:33)
i don't think had a limit because the (31:32 - 31:34)
train stuff sold out (31:33 - 31:37)
really quick and i'm sure i'm sure it (31:34 - 31:39)
ended up on ebay shortly after (31:37 - 31:41)
i'm sure uh well let's take a break when (31:39 - 31:43)
we come back we got some anime news (31:41 - 31:47)
and some pokemon vgc news so we (31:43 - 31:50)
will be right back (31:47 - 31:50)
alien invasion (31:57 - 32:02)
a space (32:10 - 32:16)
[Music] (32:25 - 32:30)
uh we are back from our break (32:27 - 32:34)
yep your favorite movie greg (32:30 - 32:37)
pokemon the movie 2000 is now on pokemon (32:34 - 32:39)
tv free to watch (32:37 - 32:42)
which ones pokemon the movie 2000 it is (32:39 - 32:45)
uh with sir lawrence the third (32:42 - 32:49)
trying to get ah yeah multrace articuno (32:45 - 32:51)
and zapdos (32:49 - 32:54)
that was very good i hm (32:51 - 32:58)
i still stand by the fact that we (32:54 - 32:59)
would have gotten the announcement for (32:58 - 33:02)
crown tundra and this movie lining up (32:59 - 33:04)
and zapdos and articuna moltres coming (33:02 - 33:06)
back to pokemon go lining up (33:04 - 33:09)
i just don't think we got i just i'm (33:06 - 33:10)
thinking (33:09 - 33:14)
words back up rewind i just think (33:10 - 33:15)
because of the pandemic (33:14 - 33:17)
they are not confident with the exact (33:15 - 33:18)
release date and that's why we have not (33:17 - 33:20)
gotten the announcement (33:18 - 33:23)
exactly the state of what chronicles (33:20 - 33:26)
i thought they said november no they (33:23 - 33:26)
just said (33:26 - 33:31)
holiday yeah yeah that's november (33:26 - 33:34)
sure yeah maybe maybe it's all (33:31 - 33:35)
coincidence (33:34 - 33:37)
i mean it would probably come in replace (33:35 - 33:38)
of a (33:37 - 33:41)
holiday game right like probably like (33:38 - 33:43)
the second week in november (33:41 - 33:44)
probably because i mean it just says (33:43 - 33:47)
fall and say fall of 2021 (33:44 - 33:49)
i thought it said holiday i thought they (33:47 - 33:51)
always used the word holiday (33:49 - 33:55)
according to gamesradar.com six days ago (33:51 - 33:58)
uh sometime in fall 2020 is what they (33:55 - 33:58)
are (33:58 - 34:00)
showing well fall is to what december (33:58 - 34:02)
21st (34:00 - 34:06)
technically technically yes (34:02 - 34:09)
okay so we know that vivid voltage is (34:06 - 34:11)
coming out (34:09 - 34:14)
the 13th of november and black friday is (34:11 - 34:16)
the 27th (34:14 - 34:19)
and so if we're assuming black friday is (34:16 - 34:21)
canceled this year if any store is (34:19 - 34:22)
foolish enough to try yeah (34:21 - 34:24)
i'm going to be picketing outside there (34:22 - 34:26)
yeah i mean (34:24 - 34:29)
they already said that like so many (34:26 - 34:30)
stores already closing (34:29 - 34:32)
like they're just not going to do that (34:30 - 34:34)
whole holiday thing (34:32 - 34:36)
they've already said that hey i'm just (34:34 - 34:38)
looking at the calendar (34:36 - 34:40)
it's all cyber just because a store is (34:38 - 34:41)
not opening for black friday doesn't (34:40 - 34:44)
mean it's still not black friday (34:41 - 34:45)
true i mean then they would do it on (34:44 - 34:47)
cyber monday sure (34:45 - 34:50)
i'm just saying we have we have three (34:47 - 34:52)
fridays before black friday we have the (34:50 - 34:52)
sixth (34:52 - 34:55)
the 13th and the 20th when did certain (34:52 - 34:56)
shield come out (34:55 - 34:59)
back my calendar up we had a party at my (34:56 - 35:00)
house greg was it that (34:59 - 35:03)
sort of chilled not memorable i remember (35:00 - 35:04)
the party i don't remember the date so (35:03 - 35:06)
richard was the 15th so we had the (35:04 - 35:11)
1st 8th 15th 22nd 29th was black friday (35:06 - 35:15)
it's the 15th and the 16th (35:11 - 35:18)
if we remember correctly was a community (35:15 - 35:20)
day was it not it was (35:18 - 35:23)
chimchar i think no chimchar (35:20 - 35:26)
yes it was a starter pokemon we we (35:23 - 35:30)
we feel like (35:26 - 35:31)
the pokemon company has a history of (35:30 - 35:33)
putting everything on the same weekend (35:31 - 35:34)
and we always complain every time they (35:33 - 35:35)
do (35:34 - 35:38)
it i don't care it doesn't matter to me (35:35 - 35:40)
if it's the 6th the 13th the 20th the (35:38 - 35:40)
28th (35:40 - 35:43)
7th december 4th december 11th doesn't (35:40 - 35:44)
matter i don't care it's coming out on (35:43 - 35:45)
the 13th (35:44 - 35:47)
but that that's where i'm staking my (35:45 - 35:49)
claim i am claiming november 13th (35:47 - 35:51)
i just think it's a little weird that (35:49 - 35:52)
they're (35:51 - 35:54)
doing a bunch of articuno zapdos small (35:52 - 35:56)
trace thingies (35:54 - 35:59)
suddenly subtly and we have not gotten a (35:56 - 36:00)
trailer yet (35:59 - 36:01)
but i don't think it's that weird (36:00 - 36:04)
because of the pandemic i mean we got a (36:01 - 36:05)
trailer (36:04 - 36:07)
we just haven't gotten a crown tundra (36:05 - 36:08)
specific trailer right (36:07 - 36:12)
we saw the artwork for them like yeah (36:08 - 36:13)
well i think i think there's just one (36:12 - 36:14)
more trailer i don't think there's gonna (36:13 - 36:16)
be like two or three trailers i think (36:14 - 36:18)
there's gonna be one more trailer (36:16 - 36:21)
show crown tundra give us the date (36:18 - 36:23)
did i love armor come out on was that on (36:21 - 36:25)
a friday (36:23 - 36:27)
uh isle of armor was on a wednesday oh (36:25 - 36:29)
yeah (36:27 - 36:29)

i am i am shaking my claim on the 13th (36:37 - 36:40)
and the 11th (36:39 - 36:43)
we got the 25th it's not coming out (36:40 - 36:44)
right before thanksgiving (36:43 - 36:46)
why well that would that wouldn't why (36:44 - 36:48)
would that be so bad though (36:46 - 36:49)
because it's to be swamped by (36:48 - 36:51)
thanksgiving things what thanksgiving (36:49 - 36:54)
every single adult and child (36:51 - 36:57)
goes man i wish i had something to do on (36:54 - 37:00)

oh they'll be football isn't football (37:03 - 37:06)
back (37:05 - 37:10)
sort of basketball it's back (37:06 - 37:13)
at this point yes we will see how the (37:10 - 37:14)
how it all plays out (37:13 - 37:17)
because november is a long way away yeah (37:14 - 37:19)
it is (37:17 - 37:20)
i feel like it's so close i feel like (37:19 - 37:23)
september's almost over at this point (37:20 - 37:26)
but it's it is literally the 13th day of (37:23 - 37:28)

new episodes got some breaking news for (37:56 - 38:01)
you guys (37:58 - 38:01)
that was the breaking news song yeah a (38:02 - 38:07)
little urgency post-breaking news would (38:05 - 38:08)
be good (38:07 - 38:11)
uh it is pronounced squivet (38:08 - 38:13)
not squove it that's what i've been (38:11 - 38:15)
saying this whole time (38:13 - 38:18)
look not here to argue because of covet (38:15 - 38:19)
right (38:18 - 38:21)
yeah yeah yes it's squirrel covet (38:19 - 38:23)
squabbit (38:21 - 38:25)
just the correction is now the the (38:23 - 38:28)
detail we still do not know (38:25 - 38:30)
whether it's what will i think will (38:28 - 38:32)
you're on the ryan camp and i'm on the (38:30 - 38:32)
road (38:32 - 38:36)
on the ryan camp i'm on the road i mean (38:32 - 38:38)
everybody's on the ryan camp except for (38:36 - 38:39)
steve (38:38 - 38:42)
right hey i went to babynames.com and i (38:39 - 38:43)
hit the little (38:42 - 38:45)
button babymainsnames.com the (38:43 - 38:47)
authoritative source for (38:45 - 38:51)
pokemon naming babynames.com (38:47 - 38:54)
literally the only website that has that (38:51 - 38:55)
name (38:54 - 38:58)
which means somebody submitted it with (38:55 - 39:01)
no pronunciation i i don't believe in (38:58 - 39:01)
the (39:01 - 39:05)
24 episodes we now have the dragon type (39:01 - 39:06)
gym leader (39:05 - 39:08)
has shown up and their name has been (39:06 - 39:10)
said out loud we're still (39:08 - 39:15)
on dragon watch for that (39:10 - 39:17)
it's ryan watch (39:15 - 39:19)
[Laughter] (39:17 - 39:23)
uh have either of you seen any of the (39:19 - 39:26)
pokemon journeys i saw 1-12 (39:23 - 39:30)
and it's good it's a little scattered (39:26 - 39:30)
but it's good (39:30 - 39:32)
yeah i think that's the problem when (39:30 - 39:34)
your trainers can go anywhere at any (39:32 - 39:34)
time it (39:34 - 39:36)
is very that's i that was irene's (39:34 - 39:37)
complaint too she's like where what city (39:36 - 39:39)
are we in right now yeah it's (39:37 - 39:42)
it's very scattered and it makes (39:39 - 39:45)
since they just travel it makes the (39:42 - 39:46)
world seem (39:45 - 39:50)
incredibly tiny because like i work (39:46 - 39:53)
go to gallery today and then like was (39:50 - 39:53)
that an (39:53 - 39:56)
hour flight like how are you what is (39:53 - 39:58)
distance here (39:56 - 40:02)
because like it took you 14 days to get (39:58 - 40:02)
somewhere by (40:02 - 40:04)
boat and then you're like we're gonna (40:02 - 40:06)
hop on a plane and we're there in like a (40:04 - 40:07)
half a second (40:06 - 40:09)
like it's very confusing they very much (40:07 - 40:11)
skip over (40:09 - 40:13)
how big the world is or they just have (40:11 - 40:14)
decided you know (40:13 - 40:17)
we don't we don't care about where these (40:14 - 40:18)
things are located (40:17 - 40:20)
they just hop on i think that it just it (40:18 - 40:21)
feels like (40:20 - 40:25)
it's hard to just everything is just (40:21 - 40:27)
disjointed a lot because they just end (40:25 - 40:30)
up in whatever region for whatever story (40:27 - 40:31)
and (40:30 - 40:33)
it feels real scattered does it feel (40:31 - 40:34)
like they're on a journey (40:33 - 40:37)
no um i mean they're making progress (40:34 - 40:39)
every episode (40:37 - 40:42)

your bee drill before you take it into (42:41 - 42:44)
battle (42:44 - 42:47)
i have two uh leftover remote raid (42:44 - 42:49)
passes because they had like a (42:47 - 42:51)
get three remote raid passes for one (42:49 - 42:54)
coin dealing they did that twice in the (42:51 - 42:54)
last (42:54 - 42:57)
two weeks yep well i only i only did it (42:54 - 42:58)
once (42:57 - 43:00)
so when you you can start with your (42:58 - 43:02)
annoying text messages of i'm about to (43:00 - 43:02)
do (43:02 - 43:05)
some raid do you want to join cuz i i (43:02 - 43:06)
might just be in the mood (43:05 - 43:10)
so we don't know if we well we do know (43:06 - 43:10)
well there's no official announcement (43:11 - 43:14)
whether we have unlocked mega pidgeot (43:12 - 43:15)
for doing two (43:14 - 43:18)
200 what was it like 2 100 million raids (43:15 - 43:19)
or something (43:18 - 43:22)
2 million raids 20 million raids it (43:19 - 43:23)
doesn't matter (43:22 - 43:25)
niantic's not setting a goal we can't (43:23 - 43:28)
achieve (43:25 - 43:28)
i mean i battled a gym at brunch today (43:30 - 43:33)
twice (43:32 - 43:36)
so did my part so the reason we haven't (43:33 - 43:37)
gotten well by the time this podcast (43:36 - 43:38)
comes up we'll probably have the (43:37 - 43:39)
announcement (43:38 - 43:41)
but the reason that there wasn't an (43:39 - 43:43)
announcement (43:41 - 43:46)
the last week was because niantic (43:43 - 43:50)
gave everyone at niantic the week off (43:46 - 43:51)
for mental health (43:50 - 43:54)
oh nice um that was the week of labor (43:51 - 43:55)
day so monday would have been off (43:54 - 43:56)
anyways and then the rest four days (43:55 - 43:59)
niantic just gave the team off (43:56 - 44:01)
um so when they get they come back in (43:59 - 44:03)
the offices or i guess (44:01 - 44:04)
i don't think they're working at the (44:03 - 44:05)
office i think they're all working at (44:04 - 44:07)
home when they come back to their home (44:05 - 44:08)
office (44:07 - 44:10)
on september 14th i'm sure we'll hear (44:08 - 44:12)
about the mega pigeot (44:10 - 44:15)
and i'm sure what is this 275 million (44:12 - 44:17)
battles between team rocket (44:15 - 44:20)
trainer battles gym battles i'm sure (44:17 - 44:22)
that will be (44:20 - 44:23)
there's just not there's just not a (44:22 - 44:25)
situation where they're like well guys (44:23 - 44:27)
you only did 260 million battles no (44:25 - 44:29)
houndoom this week (44:27 - 44:33)
like we're going to get the hound and (44:29 - 44:35)
we're going to get the pidgey at (44:33 - 44:37)
and then people are going to continue (44:35 - 44:38)
not being (44:37 - 44:42)
excited about megas i guess (44:38 - 44:43)
unless they come back from their break (44:42 - 44:46)
with a new mega plan (44:43 - 44:50)
no that's not do your mega b (44:46 - 44:52)
drill stuff i don't find your ladybug (44:50 - 44:53)
finally (44:52 - 44:56)
time time to put your complaints hat on (44:53 - 44:57)
look (44:56 - 44:59)
some people never take it off so go (44:57 - 45:00)

top players going into the finals (46:30 - 46:34)
maybe you don't play competitive battles (46:32 - 46:36)
maybe you you were like (46:34 - 46:38)
a tournament 50 battle points maybe i'll (46:36 - 46:40)
try i have a good team i'm glad that (46:38 - 46:41)
rilla boom is gone (46:40 - 46:43)
i'm not really following the format let (46:41 - 46:45)
me let me let me (46:43 - 46:48)
tell you what's happening here we right (46:45 - 46:50)
now are in series six (46:48 - 46:52)
a couple podcasts ago i think three (46:50 - 46:55)
podcasts ago we talked about how (46:52 - 46:57)
series six introduced the first time (46:55 - 46:58)
ever mid (46:57 - 47:00)
well that's a weird sentence because (46:58 - 47:02)
technically in sun and moon there was (47:00 - 47:03)
the sun cup (47:02 - 47:05)
the moon cup and then the ultra cup and (47:03 - 47:07)
they had different rules and regulations (47:05 - 47:09)
and different pokemon were banned (47:07 - 47:11)
and not banned and but in sword and (47:09 - 47:12)
shield (47:11 - 47:14)
uh every series so far has introduced (47:12 - 47:16)
new pokemon (47:14 - 47:17)
such as you know you couldn't use (47:16 - 47:19)
gigantomax lapras in series one or (47:17 - 47:20)
series two (47:19 - 47:22)
but when series three came out people (47:20 - 47:24)
were able to use gigantomax lapras (47:22 - 47:26)
and that became very dominant for a time (47:24 - 47:28)
and then when the isle of armor came out (47:26 - 47:31)
which was series five uh you could use (47:28 - 47:32)
pokemon like (47:31 - 47:35)
hidden ability rillaboom magnazone (47:32 - 47:37)
or pouring on two because those are all (47:35 - 47:40)
pokemon introduced in the isle of armor (47:37 - 47:42)
but this is the first time since sword (47:40 - 47:43)
and shield they have said (47:42 - 47:46)
pokemon are not allowed to be used which (47:43 - 47:48)
we covered there were 16 pokemon banned (47:46 - 47:50)
some of them being the popular pokemon (47:48 - 47:52)
that you you've always heard about in (47:50 - 47:54)
competitive in cinerore (47:52 - 47:57)
rilla boom porygon 2 toga kiss (47:54 - 47:59)
all these pokemon were banned and we (47:57 - 48:01)
have been in series six (47:59 - 48:04)
ever since september first so two weeks (48:01 - 48:05)
now (48:04 - 48:09)
this announcement came originally (48:05 - 48:13)
in pokemon home where in pokemon home (48:09 - 48:14)
in the announcement in pokemon home it (48:13 - 48:16)
says series 6 rules (48:14 - 48:19)
but on pokemon.com and i think (48:16 - 48:21)
on the japanesepokemon.com it said (48:19 - 48:22)
series five so there was this (48:21 - 48:23)
conflicting of well (48:22 - 48:26)
one is the pokemon company is really (48:23 - 48:27)
good at doing this (48:26 - 48:30)
they're really good at one site saying (48:27 - 48:30)
something (48:30 - 48:32)
like for example the japanese pokemon (48:30 - 48:34)
website said that (48:32 - 48:37)
what event was it oh it was the pikachu (48:34 - 48:39)
outbreak event the japanese pokemon (48:37 - 48:42)
website said the pikachu opera outbreak (48:39 - 48:44)
event was only for the weekend and then (48:42 - 48:47)
a day later the english pokemon website (48:44 - 48:48)
said oh it was two weeks (48:47 - 48:52)
long and at that point as a standard (48:48 - 48:55)
pokemon consumer who maybe doesn't check (48:52 - 48:56)
the (48:55 - 48:57)
the japanese pokemon website because (48:56 - 48:59)
maybe you're an american and you're like (48:57 - 49:00)
why would i ever go to the japanese (48:59 - 49:01)
pokemon website (49:00 - 49:03)
i that you would think that pokemon.com (49:01 - 49:04)
the english pokemon website would be (49:03 - 49:05)
trustworthy (49:04 - 49:08)
there was clearly a communication error (49:05 - 49:09)
and this has been kind of happening a (49:08 - 49:10)
lot (49:09 - 49:11)
recently i feel like it's happening more (49:10 - 49:14)
frequently uh now that we have (49:11 - 49:18)
the japanese pokemon website which (49:14 - 49:19)
uh sarah b usually pulls from the (49:18 - 49:21)
japanese pokemon website only because (49:19 - 49:22)
the japanese pokemon website is (49:21 - 49:24)
normally first and then we have the (49:22 - 49:25)
american pokemon website (49:24 - 49:27)
and then we have the pokemon twitter and (49:25 - 49:29)
then we have pokemon home now which is (49:27 - 49:30)
also providing news (49:29 - 49:33)
and we we frequently keep getting wrong (49:30 - 49:34)
information (49:33 - 49:37)
between one of the four but this was (49:34 - 49:39)
not an error here they're sticking with (49:37 - 49:41)
the series five rules it's on (49:39 - 49:43)
pokemon.com it's on the japanese pokemon (49:41 - 49:44)
website (49:43 - 49:47)
it's updated in pokemon home and then (49:44 - 49:49)
the twitter has then play at play poke (49:47 - 49:51)
that's also confusing because there's (49:49 - 49:52)
multiple pokemon twitters there's (49:51 - 49:54)
at pokemon and then there's at pokemon (49:52 - 49:56)
underscore jp and then there's at (49:54 - 49:58)
play pokemon but the at play pokemon (49:56 - 49:59)
twitter did say (49:58 - 50:02)
sorry for the confusion we are using (49:59 - 50:03)
series 5. (50:02 - 50:04)
now you might say steve why is that this (50:03 - 50:06)
isn't a big deal a lot you know series (50:04 - 50:08)
six is only two weeks old (50:06 - 50:09)
a lot of people still have their teams (50:08 - 50:10)
from series five they still got their (50:09 - 50:12)
token kisses their rillabooms you know (50:10 - 50:14)
these pokemon just didn't disintegrate (50:12 - 50:16)
when we started the series six rules (50:14 - 50:18)
this is the problem (50:16 - 50:22)
there is no way to practice (50:18 - 50:25)
your series five teams because the game (50:22 - 50:28)
banned these pokemon i have i cannot (50:25 - 50:30)
look there's a tournament coming up most (50:28 - 50:32)
people you know (50:30 - 50:35)
practice for tournaments and you have (50:32 - 50:36)
introduced now (50:35 - 50:40)
a tournament for a rule set (50:36 - 50:43)
that you've banned so what you're (50:40 - 50:43)
telling (50:43 - 50:46)
me no no no no you're wrong (50:43 - 50:50)
because you you can do (50:46 - 50:53)
your own custom rules (50:50 - 50:57)
unless they've changed that you could (50:53 - 51:00)
so you go and the thing is like (50:57 - 51:02)
what you're saying is you can't practice (51:00 - 51:04)
against randos (51:02 - 51:06)
what i would argue with some of the best (51:04 - 51:08)
practice maybe they don't want you to (51:06 - 51:11)
have good practice (51:08 - 51:11)
you can practice with friends you can (51:12 - 51:16)
yes (51:15 - 51:18)
the pokemon company the tpci the people (51:16 - 51:20)
that work at the seattle office i know (51:18 - 51:23)
quite a few of them why aren't you (51:20 - 51:25)
introducing me to these fine folks (51:23 - 51:27)
i know i i know some of them listen to (51:25 - 51:29)
the podcast some of them follow me on (51:27 - 51:31)
twitter lawsuit (51:29 - 51:34)
oh it's it there's this lawsuit is so (51:31 - 51:34)
long (51:34 - 51:37)
2021 going gonna be a great year for (51:34 - 51:39)
lawyers (51:37 - 51:40)
they they're probably not the ones that (51:39 - 51:42)
made this decision (51:40 - 51:44)
that's not what i'm getting at the (51:42 - 51:47)
people in the seattle office but they (51:44 - 51:50)
there's not a they know that people use (51:47 - 51:52)
outside sources right there there's (51:50 - 51:54)
smogon there's piqualytics (51:52 - 51:56)
there's pokemon showdown there's there's (51:54 - 51:57)
uh (51:56 - 52:00)
all these things outside of pokemon the (51:57 - 52:01)
game (52:00 - 52:04)
that people use to (52:01 - 52:07)
get teams ready to practice to check (52:04 - 52:08)
calculations (52:07 - 52:11)
all that stuff tpc eyes are well aware (52:08 - 52:12)
of this (52:11 - 52:15)
but it's still frustrating (52:12 - 52:19)
as a as a player to be like (52:15 - 52:22)
you're introducing an old rule set of (52:19 - 52:23)
pokemon you just banned (52:22 - 52:26)
everyone was excited i i made there (52:23 - 52:27)
maybe there was like four people out (52:26 - 52:28)
there that was like (52:27 - 52:31)
i really like the rilla boom i was very (52:28 - 52:32)
dominant with the grass and glide (52:31 - 52:34)
i'm very upset about the band i'm sure (52:32 - 52:36)
that person exists that's fine (52:34 - 52:39)
but the general feeling which you know (52:36 - 52:40)
when we (52:39 - 52:42)
when we we go out here on the internet (52:40 - 52:43)
and we we check the twitters and the (52:42 - 52:45)
reddits and the facebooks and the (52:43 - 52:46)
no one's checking facebook and the (52:45 - 52:49)
discords and there's always a general (52:46 - 52:50)
feeling of like (52:49 - 52:51)
are people happy with this or are people (52:50 - 52:53)
not happy with this and the general (52:51 - 52:53)
feeling for (52:53 - 52:57)
series 6 was people were happy and now (52:53 - 52:59)
you announced the players cup 2 which (52:57 - 53:01)
people were happy (52:59 - 53:04)
and and for for about 12 hours people (53:01 - 53:05)
were happy but slightly confused of (53:04 - 53:07)
where this typo was (53:05 - 53:10)
everyone thought series 5 is just a typo (53:07 - 53:12)
right we just flipped to series 6. (53:10 - 53:14)
just just the typo they're gonna check (53:12 - 53:16)
the the pokemon home says series six (53:14 - 53:20)
website says siri five there's no way (53:16 - 53:22)
that this is going to be series five and (53:20 - 53:24)
then they they announce that oh (53:22 - 53:27)
sorry for the confusion we're doing (53:24 - 53:28)
series five (53:27 - 53:31)
and in will is right you can go into a (53:28 - 53:33)
private battle in sword and shield (53:31 - 53:35)
i i i can send you a an eight-digit code (53:33 - 53:37)
you know four four four (53:35 - 53:39)
six nine six nine and i can battle will (53:37 - 53:40)
nice with (53:39 - 53:42)
with my rilla boom and my toga kiss and (53:40 - 53:43)
my incineroar (53:42 - 53:47)
and my porygon too but i cannot just go (53:43 - 53:49)
to the ladder (53:47 - 53:52)
and play or i can go to showdown (53:49 - 53:56)
but still i i don't (53:52 - 53:57)
i don't know what they're what are they (53:56 - 54:01)
trying to do here why why why (53:57 - 54:01)
is there just like one person in like (54:02 - 54:06)
japan making these decisions (54:04 - 54:09)
and they're just like well just siri (54:06 - 54:11)
like it's not that big of a deal just (54:09 - 54:13)
series five do they not play the video (54:11 - 54:14)
game do they not know (54:13 - 54:17)
that their players can't use rillaboom (54:14 - 54:18)
on the ladder (54:17 - 54:21)
like i (54:18 - 54:24)
i don't understand i was watching oh (54:21 - 54:25)
gosh i can't remember his name right now (54:24 - 54:26)
it's at the tip of my tongue the the (54:25 - 54:27)
dude who (54:26 - 54:30)
who uh the korean player very good (54:27 - 54:31)
pacharisu player (54:30 - 54:35)
season park yeah i was watching him the (54:31 - 54:36)
other day on twitch (54:35 - 54:38)
i watched him get to number one in the (54:36 - 54:40)
world you (54:38 - 54:41)
he was when i was when i started (54:40 - 54:43)
watching him he was like 300th in the (54:41 - 54:43)
world (54:43 - 54:46)
he kept winning he won like 17 games in (54:43 - 54:48)
a row he was using uh (54:46 - 54:49)
all he was using non-banned pokemon (54:48 - 54:51)
because he was playing the ladder he was (54:49 - 54:51)
you know he's (54:51 - 54:54)
using drift bloom he's using arcanine uh (54:51 - 54:56)
very cool to see (54:54 - 54:59)
and easy to watch even though i don't (54:56 - 55:02)
understand a lick of korean (54:59 - 55:04)
i understand what you know i don't need (55:02 - 55:06)
to know korean to understand when you (55:04 - 55:07)
use the dark type move on arcanine (55:06 - 55:09)
that's definitely snarls hitting both (55:07 - 55:10)
pokemon stuff (55:09 - 55:13)
very nice very good very nice guy and at (55:10 - 55:15)
one point he just went from korean to (55:13 - 55:16)
english (55:15 - 55:19)
and out of nowhere just goes why is it (55:16 - 55:19)
not (55:19 - 55:23)
series six for the player's cup (55:19 - 55:23)
and then everyone is typing in karina (55:25 - 55:29)
then he just switched back to korea and (55:27 - 55:31)
i was like (55:29 - 55:31)
i just oh yeah i just don't get it i (55:31 - 55:35)
just i can't i can say (55:33 - 55:37)
the other thing also is you mentioned (55:35 - 55:38)
that people (55:37 - 55:41)
go to outside sources for their like (55:38 - 55:42)
data and everything (55:41 - 55:45)
yes yeah um so maybe they just realized (55:42 - 55:46)
that everybody does all their practicing (55:45 - 55:49)
on pokemon showdown and they're like why (55:46 - 55:51)
should we bother with our stuff when (55:49 - 55:52)
people are just going to go to showdown (55:51 - 55:53)
anyways (55:52 - 55:58)
yeah but (55:53 - 56:00)
the reason i wouldn't want to so this is (55:58 - 56:01)
just a personal reason (56:00 - 56:03)
this is probably definitely not applying (56:01 - 56:04)
to a lot of competitive players i mean (56:03 - 56:05)
but (56:04 - 56:08)
sage and obviously practicing in sword (56:05 - 56:10)
and shield as they climbed the ladder (56:08 - 56:10)
right (56:10 - 56:13)
yeah but i mean he started out as a tcg (56:10 - 56:16)
player what does that dude know (56:13 - 56:18)
but the the nice thing about practicing (56:16 - 56:20)
in sword and shield is be (56:18 - 56:22)
you're getting rewarded for your time (56:20 - 56:24)
right you are getting (56:22 - 56:26)
you are getting battle points you're (56:24 - 56:28)
getting um protein you're getting (56:26 - 56:32)
uh beep you're getting bottle caps you (56:28 - 56:34)
are getting actual items for climbing (56:32 - 56:36)
the ladder even if you're already at (56:34 - 56:37)
master rink like every (56:36 - 56:40)
battle they give you something the meta (56:37 - 56:44)
might be slightly different in (56:40 - 56:47)
sword and shield than it would be on (56:44 - 56:48)
pokemon showdown (56:47 - 56:50)
and the reason i say that is because (56:48 - 56:51)
metas are different per (56:50 - 56:53)
metas are different in real life right (56:51 - 56:56)
like if i was to play a pokemon tcg (56:53 - 56:59)
tournament in milwaukee there might be a (56:56 - 57:00)
different meta (56:59 - 57:03)
than in [ __ ] rapids in minnesota (57:00 - 57:06)
and that's an actual real life example (57:03 - 57:07)
where i think in milwaukee it was very (57:06 - 57:09)
dark cry heavy and then in [ __ ] rapids (57:07 - 57:11)
when i played at a tournament it was (57:09 - 57:13)
gosh what were they playing at the time (57:11 - 57:15)
it was like electric or something (57:13 - 57:18)
but metas are different per (57:15 - 57:21)
yeah territory i i don't think that (57:18 - 57:23)
applies to showdown just because (57:21 - 57:26)
showdown would have the same (57:23 - 57:28)
international player base as (57:26 - 57:32)
if you were going into your actual game (57:28 - 57:35)
and doing practices it's the same people (57:32 - 57:37)
i just can't think of the reason why (57:35 - 57:39)
they besides somebody being like (57:37 - 57:42)
it's besides like well besides somebody (57:39 - 57:45)
be like ah no just do it series five (57:42 - 57:49)
where how is this benefiting anyone (57:45 - 57:51)
just you don't want people to practice (57:49 - 57:52)
go in fresh (57:51 - 57:55)
yeah it's a whole new world they're (57:52 - 57:56)
living in (57:55 - 57:58)
even even okay here's here's my last (57:56 - 58:00)
point before we move on (57:58 - 58:02)
even if you did not care about (58:00 - 58:05)
participating in the players cup (58:02 - 58:06)
and then there's like four people (58:05 - 58:08)
listening to this podcast being like yes (58:06 - 58:10)
say it i don't care about this at all (58:08 - 58:11)
even if you don't care about (58:10 - 58:13)
participating (58:11 - 58:15)
but you wanted just to watch other (58:13 - 58:17)
people battle right there is an appeal (58:15 - 58:18)
to watching people battle (58:17 - 58:21)
even though you don't battle yourself (58:18 - 58:22)
you've already seen all these pokemon (58:21 - 58:23)
fight before (58:22 - 58:25)
i've already seen the rilla booms do the (58:23 - 58:27)
grassy glides and the (58:25 - 58:30)
the uh toga kisses using the follow me (58:27 - 58:32)
and the porygon using the trick rooms (58:30 - 58:33)
i've already seen that i already saw the (58:32 - 58:35)
last player cup i've already saw (58:33 - 58:38)
the last two months of series five since (58:35 - 58:41)
since june when when all these pokemon (58:38 - 58:42)
got introduced like the willow boom and (58:41 - 58:46)
and porygon it would be exciting (58:42 - 58:49)
as a viewer who is not participating to (58:46 - 58:51)
be like oh cool i'm getting i'm getting (58:49 - 58:52)
like that's the reason i was watching (58:51 - 58:54)
sagen i was like i have (58:52 - 58:57)
driftwood sweet well it knows gus (58:54 - 59:00)
no one's using gust in 2020. no one was (58:57 - 59:03)
using gus in 1988 yeah but that dude (59:00 - 59:03)
uses (59:03 - 59:05)
some weird tactics (59:03 - 59:07)
[Laughter] (59:05 - 59:11)
so it's exciting to see new pokemon (59:07 - 59:12)
battle (59:11 - 59:15)
and now we're just gonna see rillaboom (59:12 - 59:15)
and (59:15 - 59:18)
incineroar and togekiss and porygon and (59:15 - 59:20)
i'm sure people are creative and they'll (59:18 - 59:20)
probably (59:20 - 59:22)
they'll probably be you know a couple (59:20 - 59:24)
cool things but (59:22 - 59:27)
it's this is just frustrating i hope (59:24 - 59:30)
that somebody is fighting hard to change (59:27 - 59:32)
this to series six (59:30 - 59:36)
before then but this i just (59:32 - 59:38)
yeah and i just i don't wanna go back to (59:36 - 59:40)
series five (59:38 - 59:40)
it's not gonna happen give up hope if (59:41 - 59:46)
they were (59:44 - 59:47)
they i guess they could have been like (59:46 - 59:49)
here's this here's (59:47 - 59:52)
it's series five but here is the thing (59:49 - 59:53)
you go into to do (59:52 - 59:55)
practice matches against other series (59:53 - 59:56)
five teams you have no option of doing (59:55 - 59:59)
that you can only just do (59:56 - 60:02)
friend matches at this point that's it (59:59 - 60:05)
that's all the pokemon is (60:02 - 60:08)
it's dumb it is exciting for a second (60:05 - 60:09)
players cup i'm assuming (60:08 - 60:11)
there will probably be a third player's (60:09 - 60:12)
cup because there you go that means (60:11 - 60:14)
we're getting we'll get another season (60:12 - 60:15)
of the uh (60:14 - 60:19)
pokemon champions podcast (60:15 - 60:19)
and i guess this is happening before (60:19 - 60:22)
we're right (60:22 - 60:24)
because crown tundra ain't coming out in (60:22 - 60:26)
the next two weeks so (60:24 - 60:28)
nope i'm assuming there will be another (60:26 - 60:30)
player's cup based off the pokemon added (60:28 - 60:32)
to crown tundra (60:30 - 60:35)
yeah after that uh brandon thank you for (60:32 - 60:37)
sending in the players cup (60:35 - 60:40)
stuff and (60:37 - 60:42)
that wasn't slack oh last bit of news is (60:40 - 60:44)
from andrew in our slack community (60:42 - 60:46)
if you go to a pokemon center in japan (60:44 - 60:48)
between september 12th and november 1st (60:46 - 60:49)

flight to japan and if there wasn't a (61:26 - 61:29)
pandemic (61:28 - 61:31)
you better believe i'd be there question (61:29 - 61:33)
of the week (61:31 - 61:36)
these questions all i ever wanted these (61:33 - 61:38)
questions go and ask away (61:36 - 61:43)
this time for the question of the week (61:38 - 61:45)
is that bananarama are the bengals the (61:43 - 61:46)
go-go's (61:45 - 61:49)
the go-go's (61:46 - 61:49)
when you pick two out of three (61:51 - 61:54)
i was not a bengals fan i was okay with (61:56 - 62:02)
bananarama sometimes i was a huge (61:59 - 62:03)
go-go's fan though (62:02 - 62:06)
i mean yeah was it uh jade jane wiedland (62:03 - 62:08)
was she in the legos yeah yeah (62:06 - 62:10)
that was my first concert i got to pick (62:08 - 62:11)
for myself (62:10 - 62:13)
this is from robert what are your (62:11 - 62:14)
thoughts on (62:13 - 62:18)
automated shiny hunting automated shiny (62:14 - 62:19)
hunting (62:18 - 62:22)
they've gone too far i also don't know (62:19 - 62:23)
what that means (62:22 - 62:24)
i don't know what that means i can only (62:23 - 62:26)
think of two right now (62:24 - 62:30)
um so one would be i mean i feel like (62:26 - 62:34)
clicking the pokeball during go and just (62:30 - 62:37)
seeing if you get shiny (62:34 - 62:38)
is automated is that kind of that (62:37 - 62:39)
automatic yeah i would say that's (62:38 - 62:41)
probably automated (62:39 - 62:43)
i think that's automated i mean you're (62:41 - 62:44)
not (62:43 - 62:45)
you're not doing the action yourself for (62:44 - 62:47)
clicking the button well i mean you are (62:45 - 62:50)
pressing the button (62:47 - 62:52)
but if you wrapped a rubber band around (62:50 - 62:53)
the button (62:52 - 62:56)
so it's already being pressed then i (62:53 - 62:57)
think you're (62:56 - 62:59)
maybe i'm automating but then to do this (62:57 - 63:00)
for my bike rides (62:59 - 63:04)
you shouldn't i finally found my second (63:00 - 63:06)
pokeball thing so i can get my i can (63:04 - 63:09)
hook up to sword and shield (63:06 - 63:10)
setting up a new room is is really (63:09 - 63:12)
helpful for finding things you thought (63:10 - 63:13)
you lost (63:12 - 63:15)
so there's there's three automations i (63:13 - 63:17)
can think of the first one is the (63:15 - 63:18)
easiest one (63:17 - 63:21)
you would get a turbo controller and (63:18 - 63:22)
then in sword and shield (63:21 - 63:24)
you could have it press a over and over (63:22 - 63:26)
again and you could fossil hunt (63:24 - 63:29)
all you're doing is getting fossils from (63:26 - 63:30)
the lady right (63:29 - 63:33)
careless right there's no work involved (63:30 - 63:34)
there right you just you set up the (63:33 - 63:36)
turbo controller you press a (63:34 - 63:39)
you have you know 200 plus fossils you (63:36 - 63:40)
come back in 45 minutes you check the (63:39 - 63:42)
pokedex to see if there's a (63:40 - 63:44)
shiny that would be the fastest way (63:42 - 63:46)
instead of going through all 200. (63:44 - 63:47)
there is no one you reset and then you (63:46 - 63:49)
tell her to do it again and come back in (63:47 - 63:51)
45 minutes so that's one way to automate (63:49 - 63:54)
another way would be that somebody this (63:51 - 63:55)
is way more complicated but somebody (63:54 - 63:57)
built a (63:55 - 63:59)
like a lego thing that would press the a (63:57 - 64:00)
button on the 3ds and then there was (63:59 - 64:01)
like (64:00 - 64:04)
was it this is really this is really (64:01 - 64:06)
complicated but i think there's a (64:04 - 64:08)
raspberry pi and it listened for the (64:06 - 64:10)
shiny sparkles (64:08 - 64:11)
uh and they would do it for chain (64:10 - 64:14)
fishing and if it heard the sparkle (64:11 - 64:15)
sound (64:14 - 64:17)
it would stop pressing the a button so (64:15 - 64:19)
then you would come you would come back (64:17 - 64:20)
to your 3ds and then you would be like (64:19 - 64:23)
oh there's a shiny (64:20 - 64:26)
rem raid on screen because the the the (64:23 - 64:26)
bot (64:26 - 64:29)
knew how to how to chain fish (64:26 - 64:31)
okay i'm not gonna give my opinions (64:29 - 64:34)
about these yet third way would be (64:31 - 64:37)
same thing as fossil hunting in in sword (64:34 - 64:38)
and shield (64:37 - 64:40)
but in let's go pikachu let's go eevee (64:38 - 64:42)
uh you could open up a joy con (64:40 - 64:46)
and then hook up a raspberry pi to (64:42 - 64:48)
hit the button over and over because you (64:46 - 64:50)
have to use a joy con you can't use a (64:48 - 64:51)
turbo controller (64:50 - 64:53)
but you would same thing you would (64:51 - 64:54)
fossil hunt (64:53 - 64:58)
uh for omanite or kabuto or or (64:54 - 65:01)
aerodactyl and then another way (64:58 - 65:04)
would be that you could buy it was (65:01 - 65:07)
again a raspberry pi but you would hook (65:04 - 65:08)
it up to your joy-con (65:07 - 65:11)
and then you would you would you would (65:08 - 65:12)
do what's called pathing (65:11 - 65:15)
so you would um drive your bike in a (65:12 - 65:15)
circle (65:15 - 65:18)
talk to the lady drive your bike in a (65:15 - 65:19)
circle talk to the lady (65:18 - 65:22)
and then the the raspberry pi would (65:19 - 65:24)
remember the motions so you could then (65:22 - 65:27)
egg hatch by not doing anything (65:24 - 65:29)
because your what you've programmed it (65:27 - 65:30)
to do (65:29 - 65:32)
just remembers the go into a circle talk (65:30 - 65:34)
to the lady throw away the pokemon go in (65:32 - 65:36)
a circle talk to a lady (65:34 - 65:37)
and then it would hatch a bunch of eggs (65:36 - 65:39)
or (65:37 - 65:40)
you would i think that might be a (65:39 - 65:42)
two-step you might have it where the (65:40 - 65:43)
first step of the automation is to get (65:42 - 65:45)
the eggs (65:43 - 65:46)
and then the second step of the once you (65:45 - 65:48)
have like a million eggs the second step (65:46 - 65:50)
is just spin in a circle let it hatch (65:48 - 65:50)
spin (65:50 - 65:52)
a circle let it hatch and then you check (65:50 - 65:54)
all of the eggs afterwards to see if (65:52 - 65:56)
there's a shiny then (65:54 - 65:58)
you delete using pokemon home so those (65:56 - 65:59)
are a couple ways you could automate (65:58 - 66:03)
pokemon hunts okay i have my thoughts on (65:59 - 66:04)
them i don't know if now that i've (66:03 - 66:04)
explained (66:04 - 66:05)
i don't know if you guys have any (66:04 - 66:10)
thoughts um i don't care (66:05 - 66:13)
like i so it's again it's the fallacy of (66:10 - 66:13)
time (66:13 - 66:16)
spent right like it's this oh i spent (66:13 - 66:19)
15 hours hunting this and so mine is (66:16 - 66:21)
more valuable or more earned (66:19 - 66:24)
whereas you got your shiny ferramosa (66:21 - 66:27)
in one shot i did yeah does that make (66:24 - 66:27)
that (66:27 - 66:30)
any less valuable than if you had a (66:27 - 66:33)
the 5 000 chain that you had or whatever (66:30 - 66:35)
it was for wheezing (66:33 - 66:39)
no it is an alternate color (66:35 - 66:42)
that you cleverly found a way to do cool (66:39 - 66:44)
you have it people will care about it (66:42 - 66:46)
for literally half a second (66:44 - 66:50)
they'll look at it oh cool and then (66:46 - 66:52)
judge you based off of completely (66:50 - 66:54)
pointless criteria because it didn't (66:52 - 66:55)
take you 15 hours (66:54 - 66:58)
or you found a way to do it better yeah (66:55 - 66:59)
yeah (66:58 - 67:01)
it kind of reminds me of um i'm not (66:59 - 67:02)
going to say his name (67:01 - 67:05)
but a friend of mine who commented on my (67:02 - 67:07)
current snomed shiny hunt (67:05 - 67:10)
that it is my last shiny hunt that i am (67:07 - 67:12)
certainly not doing automated (67:10 - 67:15)
uh and they asked whether i was doing (67:12 - 67:18)
um hidden ability i was like (67:15 - 67:22)
no but hidden abilities better (67:18 - 67:23)
and i was like i just i'm just trying to (67:22 - 67:26)
get a shiny here (67:23 - 67:26)
i'm not trying to get good ivs or or (67:27 - 67:30)
anything i'm not trying to make (67:29 - 67:32)
competitive i just want a little (67:30 - 67:35)
shiny ice bug that's all i want (67:32 - 67:38)
yeah i just uh people put way too much (67:35 - 67:41)
thought into these things (67:38 - 67:43)
build a machine to like recognize a (67:41 - 67:46)
shiny sparkle i think that's really cool (67:43 - 67:47)
i mean that it is very clever that's (67:46 - 67:49)
very cool but i don't think i would do (67:47 - 67:51)
it myself but i wouldn't (67:49 - 67:53)
i wouldn't like i would i would know how (67:51 - 67:55)
to do it i wouldn't judge the person to (67:53 - 67:56)
be like oh well you (67:55 - 67:58)
you went to school and you came back and (67:56 - 68:00)
there was a shiny on your screen like (67:58 - 68:01)
you know you built a sweet machine to do (68:00 - 68:03)
it that sounds awesome man (68:01 - 68:06)
like cool yeah more power to you (68:03 - 68:09)
it means the same sort of weird like our (68:06 - 68:11)
chinese too common now (68:09 - 68:14)
you got a clickbait like (68:11 - 68:18)
no they're not whatever like (68:14 - 68:21)
it is an alternate color that literally (68:18 - 68:23)
does nothing (68:21 - 68:26)
who like why why do you care this much (68:23 - 68:27)
about (68:26 - 68:30)
the legitimacy of this other than (68:27 - 68:32)
you want to feel superior to somebody (68:30 - 68:33)
else i think (68:32 - 68:36)
it's just it's that weird superiority (68:33 - 68:38)
thing like i (68:36 - 68:40)
i did this in this amount of time or (68:38 - 68:42)
this natural way and mine is therefore (68:40 - 68:44)
more legitimate and it's just (68:42 - 68:47)
it's a weird thing to put on data i mean (68:44 - 68:50)
as those of us born in the 70s say you (68:47 - 68:52)
know that shiny and a coupon will get (68:50 - 68:56)
you a discount on a shamrock shake (68:52 - 68:56)
i think for the the the the easy thing (68:56 - 69:00)
that anyone can do (68:59 - 69:02)
the only thing good at mcdonald's is the (69:00 - 69:04)
shamrock shake i'm just gonna put that (69:02 - 69:05)
out there right now (69:04 - 69:06)
i had a quarter pound last night it was (69:05 - 69:08)
very good you are (69:06 - 69:12)
taste buds are i'm not gonna get into (69:08 - 69:13)
this after the (69:12 - 69:17)
after the little caesars pizza fiasco (69:13 - 69:20)
i would be more insulted (69:17 - 69:23)
if somebody didn't use a turbo (69:20 - 69:26)
controller to hunt fossils (69:23 - 69:30)
because i don't own a turbo controller (69:26 - 69:31)
if you're gonna if you're gonna sit (69:30 - 69:33)
there and press the a button a million (69:31 - 69:35)
times one your hand is gonna get tired (69:33 - 69:38)
you gotta take care of your hands and (69:35 - 69:39)
get the carpal's tunnels (69:38 - 69:44)
two your controller is only prorated for (69:39 - 69:46)
so many button presses (69:44 - 69:47)
and do you wanna waste all your button (69:46 - 69:50)
presses what if i tape a penny on the a (69:47 - 69:51)
button (69:50 - 69:53)
on my controller no because that's not (69:51 - 69:55)
pressing it over and over again (69:53 - 69:57)
oh i think if you're buying if you're (69:55 - 69:59)
using a turbo controller on fossils i (69:57 - 70:00)
just think (69:59 - 70:02)
you're a lot smarter than the average (70:00 - 70:04)
person you're protecting (70:02 - 70:06)
look a pro controller for the nintendo (70:04 - 70:07)
switch is like (70:06 - 70:10)
69 it's very expensive you don't want to (70:07 - 70:12)
wear that out (70:10 - 70:13)
to get a slightly different colored (70:12 - 70:17)
pokemon get yourself a turbo controller (70:13 - 70:19)
here's the problem the fossils and sword (70:17 - 70:20)
and shield are garbage (70:19 - 70:22)
oh they're so shiny (70:20 - 70:24)
[Music] (70:22 - 70:27)
it's not always black and white but your (70:24 - 70:27)
heart (70:27 - 70:30)
always knows the draco fish is right (70:27 - 70:31)
yeah i like jacob (70:30 - 70:34)
i like a lot of those i don't if if (70:31 - 70:35)
somebody if somebody is (70:34 - 70:38)
arguing that you bought a turbo (70:35 - 70:39)
controller (70:38 - 70:41)
and you're not a true pokemon fan and (70:39 - 70:43)
you didn't press the a button 20 (70:41 - 70:46)
000 times to get a shiny draco fish (70:43 - 70:48)
cut ties with that person they're no (70:46 - 70:51)
longer your friend yeah i (70:48 - 70:54)
uh okay no more keeping i am fine with (70:51 - 70:55)
people (70:54 - 70:56)
building robots to do their shiny (70:55 - 70:58)
hunting for them if that's what (70:56 - 71:00)
automated shiny hunting means (70:58 - 71:03)
i am not okay with rng which i don't (71:00 - 71:05)
even know if rng is possible anymore but (71:03 - 71:07)
that old style of (71:05 - 71:09)
you know alternating the clock on your (71:07 - 71:10)
3ds (71:09 - 71:13)
or your ds so that you would be like (71:10 - 71:15)
change the percentage chance for a shiny (71:13 - 71:16)
encounter etc (71:15 - 71:19)
not that's no good because that's just (71:16 - 71:20)
hacking the game (71:19 - 71:24)
taking i don't know manipulation yep (71:20 - 71:27)
i would i would say manipulation and (71:24 - 71:29)
automation are not the same (71:27 - 71:32)

last week we did some masters stuff so (78:08 - 78:11)
if you want to see a bunch of masters (78:10 - 78:13)
polls and you want to see me lose my (78:11 - 78:14)
mind slowly (78:13 - 78:17)
because i spent 30 000 gems that is on (78:14 - 78:18)
youtube (78:17 - 78:21)
and you still didn't get leave still do (78:18 - 78:22)
not have leave (78:21 - 78:25)
i also have a video up on youtube of how (78:22 - 78:28)
i got all the vivian forms (78:25 - 78:32)
for in pokemon home so if you're trying (78:28 - 78:33)
to get there are 18 forms that you can (78:32 - 78:35)
get naturally through regions and there (78:33 - 78:36)
are two exclusive forms (78:35 - 78:39)
the fancy form and the pokeball form (78:36 - 78:41)
that uh (78:39 - 78:43)
do are not needed to complete the (78:41 - 78:45)
achievement in pokemon home (78:43 - 78:48)
but if you are thinking about trying to (78:45 - 78:50)
get all the vivions it is completely (78:48 - 78:51)
possible in pokemon home (78:50 - 78:55)
through the gts and doing no work just (78:51 - 78:57)
putting up your own vivian mine was (78:55 - 78:59)
polar (78:57 - 79:02)
uh and then waiting for the other (78:59 - 79:03)
vivians to come to you (79:02 - 79:05)
