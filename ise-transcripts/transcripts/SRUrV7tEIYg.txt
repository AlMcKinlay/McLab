[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 446 episode of the pokemon podcast i see i thought i got the episode wrong when you were laughing before but we're good no i'm your host sbj here we got some pokemon news we got greg here hello i am knee deep in making yet another pokemon rpg a dnd rpg not like a no not like a video game and it's not d it's a it's a different system oh okay okay will also here i really want a hamburger how do you feel about the meat to bun ratio oh my god no not an issue for me for me the issue is the meat to cheese ratio ratio yeah wait i also enjoy all sorts of vegetables on my burger or if it's a if it's a blue see in my burger is it too much cheese or too little cheese it really comes down to if you can't taste the cheese they have failed okay i agree i agree 100 on board here because sometimes that happens sometimes it's just like one little slice of yellow on top of my burg and i ain't taste no cheese unless i like pull the top bun off and like lick the bun you know meet the fda requirement of enough dairy product to call this a cheese burger no i i need to taste more cheese than meat i think honestly really i need i need i need generally just uh the hint of cheese i like my bacon i like my hint of cheese i like my big thick patty i do like i do like having a real amount of meat right i want my burger to be like that that's the problem with our fast food chains in this country is that the meat is slim where's the beef exactly um but the other issue right and it goes beyond just the burg right am i getting tater tots or am i getting fries with my burger because i'd rather have some seasoned tater tots i mean tater tots are a big thing up here like that's often i greatly appreciate it they are often however not treated with the same care that fries are that in what sense insufficiently fried well usually way over fried because they forget about them and two usually under salted because they think all the salt is in the mixture that the pack i'm like now you gotta stop the outside too i go for a season tot oh so the salt issue is not that big because the seasoning kind of compensates for any lack of salting what's your favorite seasoning on a tot you know i like that lowry's lowry's that's not a seasoning lottery seasoning salt sure is never heard of that before what my seasonings usually go in the same form as like the seasonings you'd find on a what is that chicken buffalo chicken chicken wings oh yeah yeah i forget the place was it red stag that did truffle tater tots i'm in i'm in speaking of fries mcdonald's yes he knows how steve avoided his entire controversy about not liking bacon on a burger and his controversial burger to bun i just we don't need to get back into the bun talk because there's only one person who i i could believe i could eat a hamburger on two pieces of lettuce which we know is like yeah like garlic is two vampires a hamburger in lettuce is to a steve how dare you ruin my perfect transition in into a conversation about fries to a conversation about pokemon toys at mcdonald's it was perfect pokemon toys at mcdonald's i i have it it's our first news article i have to walk a whole block to get to a mcdonald's while there's a burger king right outside my window well you know burger king they they peaked with the uh six gold gems that they had the old polyworld mewtwo charizard jigglypuff pikachu what's their last one publisher sure ebay will let you know this is off nintendo life because of the 25th anniversary it looks like mcdonald's will well they did say in the original press release that they will be partnering with mcdonald's but it's supposed to start next month there is a picture of what the display is supposed to look like and it's just like generic pikachu generic starters doesn't look anything too fancy but there will be cards given out as well which is usually common i think almost always that mcdonald's and pokemon have partnered up there's always a card to go with the happy meal so you know that there's toys we don't know if there's toys we know there's most likely cards at this point but what are the toys it's i guess we don't know fully but so far the display shows what looks to be starter stickers or maybe keychains i'm not sure is that a good picture no i just take issue with this because back in 1998 for those of us that can remember that far back in time 22 years ago kfc was the original partner with the pokemon company international with their pokemon beanie babies that you could get at kfc for their 25th anniversary don't you think they could have gone back to the one that came with and gotten us back into kfc's how many k how many kfc's do you think versus mcdonald's locations are there like for everyone i see there has to be like i'm talking about honor justice and respecting the history of where you came from that's what i'm talking about plus if i had to choose between a burger and a fried chicken i'd go for i'd go for the fried chicken and a biscuit heck yeah there's your meat to bun ratio give me like three three pieces of fried chicken and four biscuits and i'm in heaven the question is it looks by the way it looks like the cards being included are the starter pokemon so all we're at 25 starter pokemon at this point i think four times or eight times three plus pikachu yeah i think that's 25. oh i guess if you do yeah this leads into uh if you're going to use that kind of math it's 26 because evie i don't think there's an evie card what what a ripoff yes but for the accuracy of our program there's 26 starter pokemon sure yes i i would agree that evie would be in the starter pokemon plethora of things since uh gary takes one in yellow well also because there's a game called let's go eevee where your start of pokemon is that was the obvious one i was just giving another like two points to the point i'm like staring hard giving credit to the people who discount let's go that's what you're doing i'm staring hard at these pictures to see if there's an eevee anywhere potentially in these cards and i don't see one well it's not in the cards for this evie speaking of cards this is off pokemon.com charizard v-max phalanx v-rillaboom v-max and more in pokemon tcg shining fates in addition to providing yet another opportunity to hone battle skills and obliterate this this is off their website opposing pokemon traders pokemon trading card game will offer exciting opportunities to view pokemon in new light with each new card some cards contain powerful pokemon enough to overpower an opponent with a single attack others contain pokemon that simply make you smile or process that special ability when used efficiently and can subtly subtly influence the trajectory of a battle somebody really pulled out the thesaurus here pokemon tcg shining fates expansion boasts more than 190 cards featuring a range of adorable to ferocious in addition to some ferociously adorable here's a glimpse at some of the cards so we have a the shiny the shiny charizard v max card the shiny failings card the shiny real boom card shiny polti guys they're all shiny the the the set is called shining fates and then shiny did denney what does shiny mean does do you literally get the alternate color or is it like just the ram rainbow kind of holographic that is the alternate color like in the games oh that's cool yeah it was the same shining or hidden hidden hidden fates i don't know i don't pay that much attention but it's the so it's the same v-necks v v-neck charizard because that's getting back into style the same charizard v-max that's in the other set but now in different colors yes my charizard v max card psa gem mint 10 is going to lose value because it's not as good as the alternate colored one uh yes i don't think the i don't think the shiny charizard this shiny charger v max card will probably still be will will be worth money uh but i don't think it will decrease the value of the other rainbow rare charizard v-max or charizard v max or the other non-v max charizard but is a shining charizard that was in the other set there's been a lot of charizards in like the last six very true very true charizard's all the way down yes so all i want to do is walk into a target and get my cards and i can't yes i had to wait in line to buy cards at a target the other day and it was dumb well that's that's what happens when you don't support your local game store they all went out of business here in wisconsin that's not true when i was there with you in august we went to the local game store the barrister yeah yeah they had like three locations they're down to one which is the one you went to oh dang boy hard times okay so i will give the podcast the fast version of what's happening i did record the long version of what's happening which will go up on youtube uh with the card game but ultimately what happened is i think we talked about this before on the show but ultimately what happened is right before champions path came out which was also around the time it was the time between darkness ablaze and vivid voltage darkness ablaze has charizard in it vivid voltage had fat pikachu champions path was the bonus set that came out which also had more charizard in it and other cards that people wanted during that time a couple really really really big non pokemon youtubers decided to open older pokemon cards like base set fossil team rocket jungle on their youtube channel pretty pretty easy right old those older sets the the the team rockets the fossils the things that we grew up with the wizards of the coast sets they're very expensive right like a box of of those cards can be anywhere between like fifteen thousand dollars to fifty thousand dollars probably even more you spend like twenty thousand dollars on a box of fossil you get 36 packs and then you open them and then people it's like gambling except you're not spending the money but you're watching people open very very expensive packs and it's it can be exciting because these packs have been sitting for 20 years and some of the cards in the pack are worth money and so then other big non-pokemon youtubers took what was happening so there's a thing called breaks which i believe we talked about before where you sell the packs in the box you buy so for example if you spend twenty thousand dollars on a team rocket box you could say like will and i could go to greg and i said i could say greg i will give you one of these packs for seven hundred dollars what and then will i will give you a face pack that's the definition of give oh i will sell you one of these packs for 700 and then because there are 36 packs i find like 30 other people and now i've turned what is normally opening a pokemon box into an event because now people are both financially invested and there's like more entertainment value there right because like let's say i as a content creator sell those packs to other content creators not only is that content creator watching their audience is watching so if i was like oh man i love drive check i've never gotten into pokemon cards this is gonna be will's pack i know nothing about this but i hope whatever steve opens for will is really great so you can see how this snowballs and then after i uh the after the content creator opens the pack they do like a fake reaction of like oh wow you got a non-hollow persian you know it's still cool it's not like a dark shiny blastoise but uh you know persian is rat like they do this like fake thing to make you feel better that you spent seven hundred dollars and you got like a four dollar persian card but anyways after that i spent seven hundred dollars for somebody else to get all the joy of opening the pack for right correct don't understand how this has become a thing the i i think the reason that this has become a thing is because most of these people who are buying into a break okay and for the record i'm going to explain in a second why breaks are good uh this is like the bad side of breaks because you're getting ripped off but you're absolutely getting ripped off if you pick if you sold me a pack for 700 and what i got back was a buck 50 that's a rip that's a scam yes yes yeah and i i think do the math on the youtube video of like how much money they're making even if they so usually when a content creator sells a break they save like two or three packs for themselves but because they put an up charge on the packs they make like an eight thousand dollar profit off the entire thing regardless of the packs they open so they could open three packs and get the three persians and be like i lost like i got bad packs or they could open like dark charizard and be like oh not only did i make 8 000 off everyone else i just opened uh a 2 000 card that i can now sell so the the person hosting it is never in a lose-lose position and i think greg one of the big issues for you and me and you know pardoned me for speaking for you but we do have our particular age in common and just the fact that i really think that this is like a cult of personality thing where it's like uh who name somebody who's doing one of these things is it pewdiepie is that dude okay i don't wanna name any content creators the one that kind of started it all was uh i believe is logan paul oh the worst of them all okay fine but it's like there's people who get excited because that content creator is like saying their name yes right i guess maybe it's like let's let's take young william and greg to 1991 madonna is at the height of her cinematic and music you know and in the middle of what was her movie i can't remember the name of it truth or dare truth or dare in the middle of truth or dare she says i dedicate this performance to will anderson and i'm like yeah i'd pay 700 for that i wouldn't but that's that's well but okay you whatever whoever your cult of personality person was i'm just being making an example but that's what's hard because i think for me and greg we don't we don't find twitch or youtube personalities to have that level of sway over our hearts and emotions i also feel that way um i also couldn't ever be in a position where i would i couldn't ever do this i couldn't ever if i was to go and buy even a 5 000 booster box and write it off as a business expense and then sell those packs to my audience for what however much 5000 divided by 36 is i can't do the math but then you of course put a little on top because you got to cover shipping you got to cover the event you bake your profit but i couldn't ever be in that situation where like a viewer or a fan of my content spends 300 and i open their pack and they it either goes two ways right it either they get a card that is worth more than 200 which is normally these older packs have a couple cards that are worth more than the pack you're buying that's why the pack is so expensive right like a 700 pack always has the chance of having a card worth more than 700 that's why the pack itself is 700 but that pack also has a higher chance of having a card worth significantly less than seven hundred dollars so i couldn't ever be like well i'm opening uh bobby's pack here good luck bobby uh sorry bobby you just got an oddish uh but if you know if you psa graded it's worth like twenty dollars anyways so this happened between darkness ablaze and vivid voltage and champion's path i don't think i'm i don't think logan paul for the record i don't think that he did what i just explained i think he opened a lot of old packs with a lot of his creator friends and he pulled i think he was originally looking for charizard he pulled charizard and then he stopped opening packs that's literally all he wanted is he bought older packs to find a charizard he found a charizard and he was good that was it but the other content creators took this to a level of well everyone seems to be hyped into pokemon cards i'm gonna buy pokemon cards because if you're a big content creator twenty thousand dollars is like not you could probably like when i say big i mean like you know millions of subscribers on youtube you probably make twenty thousand dollars back in a single youtube video honestly at that point this went from youtube to twitch to wherever else content is made i will say one thing about pokemon content creators they are the most uncreative six months late to everything people when it comes to creating content pokemon content creators never come up with anything original they always they always get it from like fashion content creators or sports content create like they are always late to the game and so a bunch of non-pokemon content creators made buying very expensive older pokemon cards popular and they saw that they were making money and getting a ton of views off it so they were like well i baked pokemon i already so they started doing it too again this is the short version the long version will be on youtube [Laughter] i mean i'm yes i we we discussed this part before so this this much i understand i don't understand how this translates to what's happening now it's mostly perfect timing the between darkness ablaze and between vivid voltage the star cards in both of those sets one is charizard one is pikachu so when you have a lot of the importance here is the non-pokemon content creators opening pokemon cards and because their audience is not primarily pokemon focused they are now interested in pokemon cards because they hear these huge numbers of what cards are worth they can walk into target buy cards that are worth not as much but the barrier to entry is very low right you could buy a 600 pack of an older set and try to pull a 2 000 card or you can walk into target right now and if you buy darkness ablaze for four dollars a pack you can walk away with like a 200 charizard or if you buy vivid voltage a four dollar pack you can walk away with a 300 pikachu so you can see how this translates very easily hey i can't buy what big content creator is buying but i can buy four dollars and walk away with three 300 so all of these people rushed out to buy vivid voltage champions path darkness ablaze those are like the main ones um and those are also the newest ones and now pokemon cards are hard to find because of this i just is it really that many people who have been suckered into this form of bizarre gambling yeah yes but also also the skull the scalpers jumped in as well there are people who bought cases of vivid voltage so here here's the crazy thing i have been buying pokemon cards since our gold soul silver undaunted and that was um kind of the end of the line for gen 4 before gen 5 came out which was based at black and white noble victors emerging powers and so when i and this is when will also got a pokemon cards i believe was based at black white yeah when i would buy pokemon cards you could either go to target and spend four dollars a pack or you can go to like cool stuff inc or trolling toad or all these online shops and you can get 36 packs for 99 and that's how it always was now msrp on that is 149. if you do 149 divided by 36 that comes to four dollars a pack but if you do 30 if you do 99 divided which is what most online shops were selling the reason they sell that low is because they buy in such bulk that they can sell it at 99 and still make a profit and move them faster but 99 divided by 36 comes to like three dollars and seven cents a pack so you're saving a dollar a pack by just buying 36 packs which is a lot of money so this is where it comes into why breaks can be good if i only have fifty dollars to spend on pokemon cards and i walk into target i can only get 12 packs with my 50 and that's my limit i only have 50 i walk into target i buy four dollar packs i can only get 12 packs but if i was to go to will and i say hey will i only have fifty dollars you only have fifty dollars we together with a hundred dollars we can buy 36 packs and 36 divided by two is 18 so for the same amount of money if we go in together a break we're breaking the box in half we get six more packs each for the same price so this is why brakes can be good because you can get more packs for your money but the breaks i explained earlier are ripping you off because they because you could just go to ebay and buy a single pack of cards team rocket fossil that is weighed older packs can be weighed because they don't have that white or green card in to offset the balance so you might spend 500 on a fossil pack unweighed or you might want to spend 600 on a fossil pack that weighs a certain amount meaning that it's very likely that there's a hollow in that pack because it weighs more but these break boxes that people are doing of like hey we got 30 spots you want to buy in for hundred dollars one that's more expensive than ebay two you know that person is not weighing those packs because they're opening it live on stream so you are paying a premium for an unweighed old pack and why would you ever do that unless you want your just like name and lights and get shouted out or be a part of something people do want to feel a part of something i get it well that's that's part of what i also don't understand right that that it just does not move my soul in the slightest bit nah i'll shout somebody out what do you who wants to be shouted out send me 800 dollars and i'll shout you out i guess it's like the weirdest thing to me because that's a lot of money yes it is for a person for a person to say your name who knows nothing about you they were literally handed a piece of paper and they read it i i mean i honestly think my limits are it's like i will give you ten dollars to say my name and if you're gonna give money to charity i'll give you 25. there you go maybe like you have to have you have to have a huge following you have to say my name and where they can follow me give me give me access to your audience noble victors uh emerging powers every every set that i've purchased the 36 packs for 99 that's always been a thing i got vivid voltage for 99 i got darkness ablaze for 99 sword and shield for 99. uh rebel clash for 99. now if i wanted to buy vivid voltage one it's sold out everywhere but two if i go to ebay or anywhere else 36 packs of vivid voltage msrp 149 normally i could get for 99. now 300 for 36 packs double msrp because scalpers bought all of these to then resell because of the demand that happened in the pokemon tcg world i i will say i'm very happy that vanguard is my main game because none of this i i did see somebody express a concern that this was going to impact card availability for people who actually play competitive tcg are are people not like putting up singles on like tcg player or any of the other sites any longer no singles still go up uh like the the the star i can't remember what they're called the star cards the feature cards pretty much the the the the cards that people want to go after the pikachu the charizard and stuff chase cards the chase cards the while they are the more expensive most expensive cards they're they're not competitive no one's using the charizard of the pikachu so like in darkness ablaze one of the most competitive cards is is crowbat uh and i think before this happened crobat was like a 9 or 11 card and now it's like a 15 or 16 card so it did go up in price but not to the point where it's like oh i can't even play anymore i don't know 60 dollars for one card well 60 for one card was a thing that existed back in sun and moon and it was topu and it was before of this so here's the problem uh i just read chinese shining fates which comes out february 19th it's it's a special set most of it is alternative art 190 cards this set crashed pokemon center it is uh you ever said a skateboard you uh i walked into a gamestop a month ago to pre-order pokemon cards one i cannot believe i gave game size of the end of days wow i've never in my life pre-ordered pokemon cards but for me it's not even like i i just want open cards i i have just been collecting cards for so long uh i'm in a position where i can afford to buy a couple packs every now and then and open them and then put them in a binder and like cool i like to collect things sweet this is a thing i can now collect whereas like eight years ago i was struggling to pay my bills and i couldn't collect but i had to sell my cards to literally pay rent at one point in my life and i can't even get cards and now uh in march is the next actual set which is battle styles it's the one with urshifu i was able to pre-order a box of battle styles but it was 120 not 99 i pre-ordered from cool stuff inc that's normally where i go for my cards but there's nothing special about battle styles there's no shiny cards there's no charizard there's no pikachu and so i think it's i think going back to the start of the conversation i do think it's because big non-pokemon content creators got into pokemon cards for a short time i actually think a lot of them don't even care anymore they moved on to the next i think the next thing is rust i think that's what everyone's doing now is rust what's rust are you sure it's not yugioh no rust is like the yeah rest is like the like you kill other people and then they're permanently dead and then you steal your stuff and you build a house and hope that no one kills you and start over um okay it's it's a combination of that the timing of the chase cards being charizard to pikachu and i think the pandemic i think if people could go out to movie theaters they could travel they could uh go to plays sporting games they would have less disposable income to spend on pokemon cards if that makes sense oh isn't that the perfect combination one they're trapped in their homes and all they can do is watch these horrible horrible streamers and then those horrible horrible streamers have convinced them that this is a worthwhile investment for their cash that they're not spending on actual enjoyable experiences you've cracked the nut so i stream every monday wednesday uh on twitch wait you you stream like more days than i know i know i was just trying to squeeze in the promotion there yeah yeah so i i did that answer your question of why pokemon cards are impossible to find i just i i was not picking up i and it's it must be a function of my age on the whole cult of personality i want to be like this person but also i think look here's what it really translates into tweens can now gamble because they can spend their allowances on pokemon cards that they can high roll and try to get that jackpot out of the pack i i do explain this more in depth in the youtube video but the thing i also want to say is that i and i show this on my stream all the time because i open i do open pokemon cards but when they talk about prices of cards so for example let's let's go with the v pikachu v max let's just keep it easy easy for now like that and when i say it's a 300 card i mean it is a 300 card if you get it graded and if the grading comes back at psa 10. so if you're selling an ungraded pikachu card it is probably going to be closer to like 200 or maybe even like 150 as opposed to the 300 you can get at max value so with a lot of these streams or or youtube videos it's incredibly misleading because they will open a card like a shining lugia from call of legends or something and they will say oh my gosh this is a two thousand dollar card yes if it's psa graded 10 today because six months ago that lugia card was not two thousand dollars it's two thousand two thousand dollars right here today assuming that it's perfect condition and assuming you're selling it today so the problem with that is if you want to send a card to psa this is the problem with break boxes if you're paying into a break box the 600 and they open it up and you get like a first edition team rocket squirtle yes that team rocket squirtle psa 10 is a 500 500 first edition psa 10 squirtle is a 500 card but when you send it in to psa right now today you will not see that card for nine months because psa is nine months behind on grading that squirtle card was not five hundred dollars six months ago it was like forty dollars who is to say one that the card you open is even psa 10 because the difference between a 9.5 and a 10 is hundreds of dollars it's it's actually crazy if you if you pull up psa 10 versus psa 9.5 the the price difference will actually shock you there's some clickbait for you it is actually shocking but then you send the card out and then you get it back people are willing to pay 500 for a squirtle now but in nine months maybe maybe you can travel to canada maybe you can take your vacation to mexico maybe you can go see uh the milwaukee bucks play basketball people will move their money to other things that they cannot literally do right now they cannot go to the basketball games of the baseball games they cannot go to japan so who's to say they're going to pay 500 now and and just final point of like you can't even tell when you buy a box of cards if those cards inside are going to be psa 10. so if you're if you're like well i'm i i got 700 i'm gonna buy i'm gonna buy uh this f uh this this base that fossil i'm gonna hope for the blastoise gonna hope for the charizard and you could get it but if it's if it's if the edges are bad if the the printing is offset like all of these things can instantly it's so you are so not likely to get psa 10. like there are so many things that go wrong in the printing process of these cards like i just opened champions path four packs of champions path yesterday on my stream and the edges on all of the packs were bad and i i didn't know that i literally waited in a line at target i watched the guy unload champions path from his boxes onto the shelf i was the first one to touch it on the shelf i drove it home i opened them and all the edges were bad that was a million percent out of my control out of the dude's computer it's a bad edge bean um so like when you you you know how pokemon cards have the yellow edges and you know how pokemon cards can be reverse hollow so the whole thing but the pokemon is hollow yep if you like tilt it you can see the hollow bleed onto the edge of the card where the yellow was supposed to stop it oh so it's like just a misprint okay i have actually as you've been going through this i finally had my uh aha moment of realization this is literally what happened with tulips in amsterdam in 1637 and that is my key to under if anybody wants to understand what's going on look that up and you will get a clear boy this keeps happening over and over again in human history wow what i'm saying is it's a good time to sell all your old pokemon cards now and then buy them back in the future at a cheaper price when people stop hearing it we said we weren't gonna talk about that look i say this on my other podcast all the time the number one rule about buying cards is cards are for playing games cards are not a financial instrument if you buy cards buy cards because you want to play games with them do not buy cards because you want to finance your college education because one hundred percent guaranteed money has been around we'll put somebody through college whatever no no oh i i have been alive long enough to know that nobody makes money lasting value off of trading cards well we live through the beanie baby baby craze we know the reality and look at how rich those people are yeah how many people do you think walked away from the beanie baby like there's probably a handful of people that made money through beanie babies i would probably say the majority of people just have a room full of useless beanie babies yeah just like a majority people have a room full of useless pokemon cards that they paid some internet stranger seven hundred dollars to say on a youtube video there are there is one cool thing that uh a couple content creators do uh one is uh my friend reel breaking nate he does break it he does the breakbox thing as well but he doesn't charge anyone for it he just he's like we got 36 spots i'm gonna pick random people who comment on my youtube videos or who retweet my tweets i pay he pays for the shipping he'll say like greg this is your pack hope you get something good open the pack cool you got something all right let me know your address i'm gonna mail it your way if you want me to sign anything cool no cost to you and that i i have huge respect for because it's one he's still probably guaranteed making the money back on the content itself right whether he spends like two hundred dollars or a thousand dollars on the box he's probably making that back with ad revenue and stuff two great thing to do for the community very exciting people feel like oh cool i gotta pack here i get my name shouted out i get something from my favorite content creator and three there's like it's not a lose-lose situation right if you spend seven hundred dollars and you pull a two thousand 000 lugio card you probably feel like you've gone to the moon and back right that's an incredible feeling it's like the same thing of winning a lottery ticket but if you spend 700 and they open a five dollar persian card not only does it feel unju it feels so not genuine for the content creator to be like oh well you know uh persian is okay but if you want me to sign it i will like not only is your favorite content creator suddenly faking this like gen this is this excitement for you but you've also just lost a bunch of money on top of that so like even if uh so in a free situation where i'm like hey i'm buying a box of darkness ablaze if if we pull you the charizard or the crowbat cool hype if not hey you didn't lose anything you get something in the mail from me really cool i would love to do something like that for our community just because it would be fun but also it's impossible to find pokemon cards so uh not happening dang alright we have some pokemon go news some pokemon masters news we have pokemon godzilla news so we will be right back [Music] steve have you ever had a breakfast burrito yeah have you had a

store cast form jirachi they're all there but what's the most important one that's there time echo no why are you dumb uh rosalio's there i know we were to look at the japanese pokemon center and look at the top 10 selling what do you think out of all gen 3. give me like two or three pokemon you think are top of the list for gen three that would gen three not greg greg's gonna say rosalia but like no of the general population zagoon tail no [Laughter] i didn't say bottom three ladies pussiana and spinda hmm what are you what are your three wait why why ladies that's not hoenn yes yeah yeah it is wait oh oh good gracious my brain just went to a whole other planet um top three uh i'm gonna put a mudkip up there definitely um ooh looty colo and for a third there's a lot of good choices here but i'm gonna go with the gardevoir okay does that count gardevoir would be on would be gentria uh so according to the japanese pokemon center the top 10 selling were jirachi flygon trap pinch ratchet kyogre latias milotic mudkip latios spheel and rayquaza well i mean i got one i got the mud kip you did get one kipp yeah your ratchet i don't care [Laughter] i mean i have two of the sitting plushies sitting in my cart right now so the question is do i that's how your car gets broken into buddy yeah they do not have all as of as at least as we're recording this they they have not put up all 134 yeah they're they're slowly adding them so i'm not sure during this time if things are going to sell out or not over the weekend i think i fell in love with thorgle i mean it is i'm going to argue that cast form snowy form is having great difficulty sitting let me look at this feel plush that's uh yeah he's pretty round why wouldn't he be around that's all this feel is it's a big round i kinda really like the shell gone plush what he he looks cute he looks cozy said nobody ever don't look don't don't browse too fast it'll block you it'll think you're a robot if you get too excited about these plushes wait how do i make sure that i'm only looking at sitting cuties just go to new releases uh the spin to plush looks awesome yeah the spinner plush actually is very good and i am tempted to buy it i think i would do maybe spinda chimeko and oracle but i am adding to my already growing collection i don't know why i'm it actually does blow me away that jarachi is number one just because there's been so much jirachi merch already yeah but that's it's like i mean there's a lot of charges in the ratchet yeah but it's like we've never got an anarith plush where where are those anoreth people at push it push it up move it move it to the top of the list no greg that's sableye sitting cutie oh i said i have two things in my cart oh i thought you said you said had two things in your car that's why i was like that's how your car gets broken into buddy into my cart the mall wild one is kind of bad it's bad i don't know how they messed this one up it's hard to make a no it's hard to make a good ma while because they got to have that big mouth and it's just not it's going to knock it off balance and yeah the low tad one is good the low tad one is super cute that's i'm tempted he's a round boy too yeah low tad fits into the sitting cutie appropriateness realm the zigzagoon is also pretty good can't we just have like cute pokemon as the sitting cuties and not just like every pokemon i mean the city cuties is every pokemon you know eventually they'll get to avalon and four people will buy it and i know one of them uh the nose pass is just wild i just you know if if there's any sitting cutie that might finally get some limelight that probably pass they can really do something with that mustache yeah something i want to know time to shine who's buying the gorbas and the huntails i need to know i need to know who is not ironically either i don't want somebody writing and being like oh i bought the corvus this weekend yeah you bought the gorbis this weekend just to write in that you bought the gorbas this weekend dean i think you should buy them i'm not getting gorbachev oh though that's all about all the clam pearl stands is what it is you know what plush turned out nice ninketa how did they do this how did they make the ninketa plush so good but they messed up so many other ones there's a niketa fan and i think the nakedas plush's uh quality is all in the eye look at the abomination that is that monetric oh my goodness i'm just gonna break that up oh then why is there no injure one that one's not all added yet okay they're like like there's a like the torquel was not here at the start of recording so they're they're slowly adding them oh that is a slow roll out right there update on pokemon center clothing uh no one at the gym has yet to come up and compliment me for my pikachu wear so just return it what is their problem i'm about to i'm about to i kind of am i buying this spinda yeah oh yeah you can get it as a gift for somebody else get that i mean i wouldn't i would definitely give gift this to a certain person it's in the cart and now i'm looking to see if i can get that really sweet shirt yeah i get that free shipping tank top well i'm looking at the tank tops twenty dollars this is sent in by uh kevin from our slack community off go nintendo hard shell studio releasing mecha godzilla pikachu figure i mean that's pretty much the gist of it but uh this is wait is the pikachu a mechagodzilla or is it a pikachu that's featured in the new godzilla vs king kong movie it is a so do we have do we have to explain what mecha godzilla is there might be some people who don't know it's godzilla as a robot okay next so imagine pikachu wearing a mechagodzilla costume i'd rather not that's pretty much it it's cute the mecca godzilla pikachu is made of pu and what is pu and resin plastic it means bad polyurean polyurethane urethane polyurethane and uh is 15 inches tall that's pretty tall that's big there are 398 units to go around they are priced at a hundred and four dollars they are to launch q3 of 2021. why is it so angry i mean it's we're in a it's role playing oh i just saw that it should be the more that it's cosplaying the the picture in the article is a really bad angle if you look at like the whole behind picture it looks pretty good yeah it's i mean it's real good it is an angry peachy though it is angry but so is megan godzilla so well is it's a robot does it really have emotions if it was programmed yeah yeah does it no you gotta program the emotions in that does that means they're fake programmed emotions they're not real but if there's only 398 pieces uh hey i can add to my cart right now 398 pieces yeah they said it was limited 400 well oh that what a weird way to put it well yeah they should just say limit 400 like no like why generally like yes if you make 400 i'm assuming one person the creator gets one and then probably one person like i two yes just put 400 though don't like we we just assume that two of the 400 yeah whatever i kind of want this i i look at it thirty four dollars you got money to throw around yeah no it's not thirty four dollars it's a hundred dollars oh the website i am looking at right now oh it's deposit is 34. yes there you go oh well you do hold your full payment is 100 i could put 33 down lock it in yes yes and then i mean it doesn't ship until like september october estimated because they're hand carving from the polyurethane yes oh wait this website says there's more pikachus wait is there an actual godz there is a godzilla pikachu that pikachu is way cuter what does this ride choose this company has a lot of pokemon resin statues yeah are are these official these have to be official right i would imagine they must be otherwise this company would be sued but this pikachu wearing a gatomon costume i have to investigate more in this company i'm giving i am giving anyone my money for fake pokemon merch i only want the most legit merch that will appreciate in value as it sits in my closet of course they have a lot they have a lot they have so much they can they have to have a deal right because like this is way too much and way too easily found all right let's shift gears over to valentine's day this is off pokemon.com valentine's or make that palentines get it greg get it no neither passio valentine pal palentine i thought it was to take the romance out of it because you're just pals because they're celebrating friendship oh yeah i got that yeah i didn't get it then because i thought the p was for passion it would be wow but you know i i'll give him a little bit of credit because i think i think pal was really just like big in the 70s it was like hey pal how you doing oh i've really lost all drive to read the story now i will read it all right you read it all right valentine or make that palantines bring don and el cremie and serena and whimsicott to pokemon masters ex you've heard of valentine's day but on the island of pacio there's a special event that celebrates friendship valentine's day from january 28th 2021 to february 18th 2021 you could experience valentine's day for yourself in pokemon masters ex during this time you can play through the baking buddies story event which follows serena and dawn as they pair as they prepare some tasty treats for their friends the battles you participate in throughout the story event will earn you rewards they can be exchanged for other useful items and there's a bunch of stuff about sync pairs that nobody cares about yeah serena and whimsicott are pullable uh and then starting in the 31st done in el cremy yeah by the time this podcast goes up you should be able to get dawn and el cremie people wanted more holiday sink bears yes it was the thing that people voted on and then they remember the survey i mean vaguely and now that she's they they're pumping out a holiday sync i mean they they listened people wanted holiday sling bears say they are i like the outfits i think they're good yeah they're cute i haven't started the story line yet i have not started it either full disclosure i am partnered with dna i am curious it just they gave dawn alcremy which i felt like was a guaranteed for opal to have yeah you could you could make the argument that like they have said they're bringing giganta max to the game and that opel would get giganta maxell cremy and then obviously i guess leon would get gigantomax char there's no way they introduced leon without introducing chart like you can't give leon anything but charizard this is like literally his pokemon it's pretty accurate yeah so i guess they could just give opel gigantomax a cremi but then it's like so many other pokemon are being forgotten there are not eight hundred and ninety-eight trainers that exist in the pokemon world there are eight hundred and eighty nine pokemons you have plenty of options i mean they could do glare and rapidash for opal yeah i mean it matches your colors more wheezing gallerian wheezing yeah i mean she opens with wheezing i think right it's like wheezing rapidash togekiss in the game she has wheezing i think her actual team is in the star tournament or in the gym battle oh and then everybody is the star turtle in the gym battle i think it's wheezing together cremi and then the star tournament i think it's she has like a mall while in a rapidash as well now she she has a wheezing mile together kissing the cremate at the gym okay star tournament extractor meant mobile is dropped like a hot potato but she doesn't have rapidash so it will probably not not mind you that they that they are tied to anything in the games they can do whatever they want they can yeah but for the most part they've been following some sort of logic i mean stephen did get metagross [Laughter] we would assume diantha whenever she shows up in the next 20 years we'll get gardavoria still on that screen but still not in the game greatest greatest champion cut from the game hey people want more fairy type attackers here they are i mean are they good though that i don't know i don't i haven't looked at what people feel about them or or or whatnot i think cosmetically people like the dawn one better but you know people love serena but that's happening right now and we are getting awfully close to the year and a half celebration yeah so they have a they've got a ton of god they just added a bunch of stuff into the list and not all of them are great like they're just there are we talking about masters whether used whether they're worth pulling or not oh just characters in general yeah cause like they added mallow and serena and it's just like that offers nothing to the game i'm trying to think of what i use normally for grass i mean you have two you have two exes in superior and venusaur malo and this is the problem i talked about before mello is a five star with no ex potential at this point and probably doesn't have an unlike grid it is just a banner that doesn't add to the game that arguably if you like really like this pair they are going to be frustrating to use because there are already existing pairs that do everything better i'm just not going to pull on that banner you don't pull out any of the banners i don't even know what those words mean they just came out of my mouth it is to the point where it's very hard to pull on every banner unless you're paying money yeah i mean at the point i mean yeah it's a gotcha game but like the last few like the last few banners and pairs that they've put up i think only end and may have been really worth pulling for i mean i think of it like pokemon go they were bad whereas i don't think i've done i haven't paid for a five-star rate and go since the regis because everything's been repeats now it's been like the rykos and the ho-ohs and the lugias and the and it's been actually great because i have all those so i can just skip them and my wallet is very happy so when i just like saw mallow and zarina i do want them because i like collecting one of every poke pair but hey i'll wait and so we can have some lackluster like i i do really want dawn and i'll crammy so i will save my gems and pull on her um but sometimes lackluster pairs and whether that's go or masters i hate i'll take it as a my wallet is happy this week yeah it's just is the growing it's just a problem with all of these that they have limited banners for things that aren't aren't going to help you do the game like they just aren't great yet they're still five-star for pay banners like and it's it i always find it sort of frust like if i think there should be a fairly good balance at the things that that you're promoting and they should serve a purpose and shouldn't just be dumped into the game but we're kind of at that point in masters where you have the set things that are good and they want to add pairs so they're just dumping things in which is like it's good if you do the research it's bad if you think oh this is going to be a great pair and i really like this pair and then you try to use them because they're just in no way shape or form up to any of the tasks you want them to do last bit of news here is off pokemon go live uh feel the love with pokemon go's february events hey did you guys finish your a joto oh don't get me started looking and trying and having people ask me about that just brought out one realization for me i don't like pokemon go i don't like the game the only reason i enjoy playing it is when i get to play in person with my friends otherwise i don't like this game at all that just the the the blank mill tank silhouette staring at me so cruelly and i was like really melting the toughest one to find i feel like i still haven't found one i haven't looked i went to the mall to pick up some five guys and no joke every single pokemon spawned at once i found two larva tar there was one mil tank there's the murkrow there was all the starters oh it was it was great i it was the easiest weekend i literally opened pokemon go this morning and a cub chew popped up and i literally said get out of here nobody loves you yeah for being a limited time come true event that bear still really stuck around that bear and it's not hanging around let me see i'm looking at my collection all right how many do you think out of the joke johto collection challenge do you how many how what's your guesses for how many i caught i say you're missing three like during the challenge time yeah like as of right now i'm just pulled it open there's a list of pokemon to catch how many do you think i've caught so how many check marks do you have yeah how many check marks do i have six zero you're both wrong three i've managed to catch a cyndaquil a toto dial and a sun curtain and that's it again my weekly complaint why is hoppip not on the list why is apom not on the list why is snubble not on the list i have all of these in my house i see them constantly why because this isn't for you just this is to punish all of us why is smeargle still a silhouette for me because you guys i've taken pictures in this game before catch it again how are you supposed to get your smeargle medal if you're not taking a thousand pictures of smeargle does that not do you also understand that the fact that i don't go outside of my house and taking pictures are in conflict because i've got too much furniture i don't have room for these pokemon to be running around in my house no i mean we all collected that i was not completing jojo because johto is garbage you need to collect these medals so they can appreciate in value do you know what pokemon is is available to me right now what pokemon has spawned by me apop oh none zero there are no pokemon by me i love burger king will that i'm the obviously not the one by my house i have i have a winning enterprise for us we start a service that converts pokemon go metals into real actual cryptocurrency okay nice step pick a coin step one the ideal step three profit yeah look i have i have a team rocket balloon floating around my head let me touch it so i can battle a team rocket grunt and finally get that challenge done here we go it's a big r oh to prove me wrong it finally is a daggone crunch oh come on come on every other time it's a leader well get wrecked oh no she gonna get wrecked yeah all right what's the february breakout the the the breakthrough encounter for february will be snorlax as we know that the kanto event is coming up and they're gonna turn all the pokemon gen one pokemon shiny so i would assume for the first two weeks the snorlax can't be shiny i guess i guess yeah i don't know uh starlax is your

9th will uh oh that will be available to level 40 plus trainers in new zealand on february 9th it will become worldwide to everyone at the end of march that's it that's a lot of pokemon go stuff and that i think is all the news so we've gotten through it all let's jump to our question of the week it's not unusual to have the question of the week that was brief yeah that's gonna be a second verse no i mean i could i could go on like i wrote verses for days but like let's get let's get into the brass tacks people this is from brandon uh if you could make a godzilla verse kong movie in the style of pokemon what would it be i mean that answer is obvious it's gigantic max tyranitar versus giganta max really boom [Laughter] excellent that's pretty good i guess we're done here well what about zarud oh wait that's right nobody got the email nobody got the email [Music] my problem is that my favorite favorite favorite favorite kaiju is mothra so i would say you can bring in gigantomax butterfree that's not a moth that's a butterfly get your lepidoptera correct ugh i'm just i will dynamax a mautham dynamics or a vena moth something like that they need a gigantomax uh venom off absolutely not everybody can get a gigantic max that's not how this works steven also we'll just do two questions here uh to celebrate this year this launch of series eight which actually starts tonight or by the time this podcast is up uh what advice and lessons would you give to an inexperienced player who would want to get into competitive battles don't yeah that's probably the the correct answer the only a friend who enjoys breeding competitive pokemon and have them breed your team for you so that you don't have to waste your time doing that i mean the good thing about sargeant you can rent teams right like you can find stuff like so try out a bunch of teams in this format to see what style of play you like before you have to do all the hard work of trying to build your own yeah that's really good advice actually is instead of a lot of times you see people that this is this is the standard procedure people go i want to get into competitive you go okay and they don't look at anything competitive related they think of a team that they like and then they spend like three weeks building the team they're like i'm gonna shiny hunt the the the fee bass because i want milotic on the team i'm gonna go catch this i'm gonna go shiny hunt that i'm going to breed zero ivs in this dust clops they do all the work they do all the ev training they do all the breeding they have their their notepad with their spreadsheets and stuff spoiler this was me like 10 years ago um and then after putting in all that time and effort they take their team to go competitively battle on the ladder and then they lose and they're like ah do it again and then they lose and then they get frustrated then they quit competitive this is the standard i want to get into competitive process that pushes people away from competitive it's the wrong approach don't put any effort into building a team and so you know what you like and what you don't like per that format so for example when i say format doraleo don was very good in like series one and series two but we're on series eight and doraleon ain't good anymore no one's using doraldon you might love doraledon i understand but unfortunately there are just other pokemon that fit that role better that replay like better gross you wanna you wanna you wanna steal pokemon that does good damage to fairies doraldon ain't the choice metagross is the choice so yeah like when i i really thought i wanted to run a trick room team initially when i got into competitive i rented a bunch of trick room teams i realized i didn't like that and instead i found out that i really liked i really liked teams that were just bulky so like even though i would i wouldn't win the speed wars like oh i'm i have the fastest pokemon i accepted that i wouldn't win speed wars in return of just having pokemon that had really good survivability so you gotta you gotta see what you like and you don't like that's the same thing in the pokemon trading card game for the most most of the time all electric decks are pretty much the same they usually grab energy they usually discard energy and they grab that energy back from the discard pile usually grass decks move around energy on the field usually water decks take energy from your hand directly and and puts it onto your bench in in more than once uh fire decks usually discard energies but unlike lightning decks you usually have to use supporters or trainer cards to get that energy back and and teams like this in the video game are also the same you could either have very fast teams you could have uh very like trick room focus teams you could have teams that stall you have very bulky teams very offensive teams but you have to figure out your play style and and adapt to that and then once you figure out what you like then you can build a team around that and i get it people want to use their favorite pokemon i totally understand but if you don't have that core established you can't just jump to your favorite pokemon so you might have to play with pokemon that are established in the meta for a reason like these pokemon are good because of xyz understand why those pokemon are good because of xyz and once you have that foundation built then you can start it to experiment a little bit more and maybe take five meta pokemon and then one of your favorite pokemon and then once that seems to be working for you maybe you can take four meta pokemon and two of your favorite pokemon you can't just go like i spent three weeks six of my favorite pokemon okay now i'm just losing non-stop well this isn't fun because no one likes to lose i don't hate losing when there's a bald guy shirt at the end there you go uh will pokemon of the week all right last week's pokemon of the week boy oh boy i got some complaints uh let's see here we go because a lot of people didn't listen to the first paragraph in which i referenced the team of twitch plays pokemon and i made fun of steve because he thinks people still care about illuminate and that omanite was important which we all know is not true oh when it's a cutie um whatever uh and then in the second paragraph i mentioned pokemon evolutions in kanto where it really seems like they were scrambled as in uh dratini going and turning into dragonite versus gyarados which obviously that's what it was intended to do and then i also indicated that if you remembered the previous week's pokemon which was weedle that you'd be able to have a clue towards this week's pokemon greg since you will know the answer what is what is the pokemon of the week it's shogun it's venomoth venomoth shell gone is not was not in twitch plays pokemon in my heart it was well your heart is a disturbing disturbing location uh i remember venomoth's name in twitch plays pokemon which was atv all terrain vehicle correct and i remember i remember i was there live oh gosh i love live content so much i was there i was there i do i really do it's it's like it's why i actually like wrestling i like that it's live i have zero interest once it's not live anymore i remember the the venomoth versus lance fight and everyone was like it's over and venom moth was able to beat the dragonite oh it was so good it was perfect content it was incredible i will never forget that there's no such thing as perfect content venomoth versus dragonite was perfect content i want to see for the 25th anniversary somebody do an anime style battle of the venomoth battle from twitch plays pokemon all right this is what i want for my 25 year old and to explain to the folks who didn't quite pick up on it venonat has butter free eyes yeah caterpie and metapod have venomoth eyes venonat has butter free antenna which venomoth does not have antenna at all well yes not that same kind at least so obviously somebody must have just like there must have been like a spreadsheet of like here's all the evolutions and then somebody accidentally like inserted another cell just shipped everything down or something i don't know why they were copy pasting too quick ah i know how they love to copy and paste bad the shuffle icon they really messed up venom off here oh yeah it's it is bad how do they do this i don't even understand how that's supposed to represent a venomoth besides the eye that might be the worst color we need a podcast where we rank all the shuffle icons right now benefits on the bottom of this podcast we promise people a quarterly ranking system uh we got to hit it well we're starting today venomoth on the bottom of pokemon shuffle icons i'm sure there's worse i'm sure there's venom moth is also bad in rumble rush like they just do it dirty oh yeah it is just sad the only one that comes close to being decent is the mystery dungeon one and we all know mystery dungeon's a garbage series you have never agreed more look at the original pokemon trose one up at the top yeah that was like way better no it's not the original pokemon jose one it's the same as the battle trojan shuffle it's just smaller moving peaked in pokemon pinball maybe ah venomoth is a good shiny i really like really good in let's go pikachu let's go eevee really really good that may be my next shiny hunt yeah it's it is so good although do you notice how like once they got uh into x and y they dropped the having the thorax be like a nice brown yeah and it's just kind of gray now that pokemon company always changing the colors on us they still can't figure out what color gligar is [Laughter] slygar the ever-changing color what's uh what's next week all right because i got complaints that people had a hard time solving pokemon of the week because it they uh the the clues were too long and they lost track as i went on i made this the longest clues ever here we go some internet resources of dubious quality claim that the gen 4 and gen 7 games are tied for the number of mythical pokemon that were made available as part of their games while i hate the pointless and quite arbitrary debates concerning mythical versus legendary pokemon all of the pokemon being considered for these purposes were only available through a unique distribution method the gen 4 games provided access to vienne manafi dark rye shaymin and arceus five pokemon two of which have an evolutionary relationship gen seven games have three mythical pokemon that were obtainable through traditional mystery gift distribution methods one of these was commonly believed to have been part of the kalos region this is not the
