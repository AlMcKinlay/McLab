[Music] (0:01 - 0:28)
what's up everyone welcome to the (0:25 - 0:30)
429th episode of the pokemon (0:28 - 0:32)
podcast it's super effective i'm your (0:30 - 0:34)
host sbj (0:32 - 0:37)
will here i'm launching an investigation (0:34 - 0:37)
into (0:37 - 0:40)
cub foods and their carrot cake i (0:37 - 0:42)
suspect they're including an ingredient (0:40 - 0:43)
in there (0:42 - 0:46)
that is an of an addictive property (0:43 - 0:47)
possibly nicotine (0:46 - 0:49)
i don't i don't know but i can't stop (0:47 - 0:51)
eating their carrot cake (0:49 - 0:52)
and and i've got to get to the root of (0:51 - 0:54)
this greg (0:52 - 0:57)
in the wild in the wild at said cub (0:54 - 1:00)
foods last weekend (0:57 - 1:03)
i saw a person write a check (1:00 - 1:08)
at the cash register what is this 1988 (1:03 - 1:08)
i literally just sat there and rudely (1:09 - 1:12)
stared (1:11 - 1:16)
because i had no idea (1:12 - 1:18)
like i'm like we're on a camera show (1:16 - 1:19)
what (1:18 - 1:22)
why is where did you even get it (1:19 - 1:25)
and like the cash register person that (1:22 - 1:25)
was (1:25 - 1:27)
clearly confused as to what was (1:25 - 1:30)
everybody everybody around was like (1:27 - 1:33)
i have no idea what's going on this is (1:30 - 1:34)
the weirdest thing we've ever seen (1:33 - 1:37)
i'm pretty sure the last time i wrote a (1:34 - 1:39)
check at a grocery store was about (1:37 - 1:41)
2009-2010 (1:39 - 1:44)
somewhere around there oh yeah that was (1:41 - 1:45)
10 years ago (1:44 - 1:49)
plus plus covet time which is like (1:45 - 1:50)
a million so (1:49 - 1:52)
[Laughter] (1:50 - 1:54)
i mean you're going to sit there and (1:52 - 1:56)
make that whole transaction (1:54 - 1:59)
longer at least they had a mask on (1:56 - 1:59)
it's little it's little things it's a (2:00 - 2:03)
little (2:03 - 2:06)
it's the little pieces of of generosity (2:03 - 2:09)
that we really like in these days (2:06 - 2:12)
all right we got a loaded show here for (2:09 - 2:13)
you all (2:12 - 2:16)
something happened uh i don't know they (2:13 - 2:17)
announced (2:16 - 2:19)
you know a little a little something (2:17 - 2:21)
called dlc (2:19 - 2:23)
oh the gen 4 remakes are here i mean it (2:21 - 2:24)
wasn't that that's not like it was like (2:23 - 2:27)
wow this came from out of nowhere (2:24 - 2:29)
it was like true gee you finally got (2:27 - 2:31)
around to it (2:29 - 2:33)
they didn't say autumn it would it would (2:31 - 2:35)
be more exciting if they announced (2:33 - 2:37)
pokemon sleep but sure (2:35 - 2:42)
um they did steal your joke greg (2:37 - 2:44)
who stole the joke what joke pokemon (2:42 - 2:47)
pokemon stole greg's joke so mad at them (2:44 - 2:50)
greg was the first person to say pokemon (2:47 - 2:51)
go home and sleep (2:50 - 2:54)
i'm sure that's far from true (2:51 - 2:57)
no i have it documented on the internet (2:54 - 2:58)
documentation (2:57 - 3:01)
yes and then and then they're like oh (2:58 - 3:02)
we're gonna (3:01 - 3:05)
advertise that you can do xyz pokemon go (3:02 - 3:06)
home (3:05 - 3:10)
ha ha where's my sleep buddy yeah (3:06 - 3:12)
i'm suing this is all part of the bigger (3:10 - 3:13)
lawsuit (3:12 - 3:15)
taking them all down and there's a lot (3:13 - 3:17)
of pokemon go news so those are the two (3:15 - 3:19)
things we're gonna focus (3:17 - 3:20)
this episode i think we'll just get the (3:19 - 3:23)
pokemon go news out of the way (3:20 - 3:27)
because it's more uh (3:23 - 3:28)
disappointing i guess (3:27 - 3:31)
[Laughter] (3:28 - 3:35)
start with the good stuff i got (3:31 - 3:36)
yeah let's start with the good stuff (3:35 - 3:38)
here this is awesome (3:36 - 3:41)
the good stuff pokemon go live.com (3:38 - 3:43)
the official pokemon go website (3:41 - 3:46)
september 30th here enjoy a limited time (3:43 - 3:49)
free remote raid pass every monday from (3:46 - 3:50)
october 5th (3:49 - 3:53)
through november 30th now can they only (3:50 - 3:55)
be used that day or can you build them (3:53 - 3:56)
up (3:55 - 3:57)
you can build them read me this read me (3:56 - 3:59)
this press please please (3:57 - 4:01)
uh each remote raid pass will be (3:59 - 4:03)
available for a week (4:01 - 4:05)
you have to check the in-game shop to (4:03 - 4:07)
claim it before it's gone (4:05 - 4:10)
from reminder you can only have fewer (4:07 - 4:12)
than three (4:10 - 4:14)
to claim the remote raid pass what does (4:12 - 4:16)
that mean it means if you have three (4:14 - 4:18)
you cannot claim a fourth one you have (4:16 - 4:20)
to use one and then claim it (4:18 - 4:23)
the most you can hold is five but you (4:20 - 4:25)
can only hold five if you're holding two (4:23 - 4:28)
and you buy a three pack but if you're (4:25 - 4:29)
only buying (4:28 - 4:31)
if you're receiving a free individual (4:29 - 4:33)
one you have to have less than three to (4:31 - 4:34)
grab it (4:33 - 4:37)
it's really silly i think the only (4:34 - 4:38)
reason they're doing this (4:37 - 4:41)
is because remote rate passes are (4:38 - 4:42)
technically discounted at this point and (4:41 - 4:44)
they don't want people to stock up (4:42 - 4:47)
on the discounted price when they decide (4:44 - 4:49)
to change it (4:47 - 4:53)
the non-discounted price i'm assuming (4:49 - 4:56)
i mean you limited at three just let us (4:53 - 4:58)
build them up it's not like it's costing (4:56 - 5:00)
you anything and it is literally (4:58 - 5:03)
safety it measures like i hate the fact (5:00 - 5:04)
that it's (5:03 - 5:08)
oh you get three that's it it's like (5:04 - 5:10)
come on i mean they're just punishing (5:08 - 5:11)
the whales at this point (5:10 - 5:14)
i've seen plenty of very hardcore whales (5:11 - 5:17)
stock up on 200 plus remote raid passes (5:14 - 5:19)
during that christmas bundle where the (5:17 - 5:21)
not remote rate passes regular raid (5:19 - 5:23)
passes or last year's christmas bundle (5:21 - 5:26)
which was one of the best prices (5:23 - 5:28)
joke was on them where no one was using (5:26 - 5:31)
regular red princesses (5:28 - 5:33)
i mean they will eventually yeah they (5:31 - 5:34)
will eventually (5:33 - 5:36)
they don't go bad true they do take up (5:34 - 5:39)
storage though they take up storage (5:36 - 5:41)
controversial storage space okay so free (5:39 - 5:43)
raid passes (5:41 - 5:47)
or what is that seven free ones (5:43 - 5:49)
but you can only carry three so get them (5:47 - 5:51)
in the well (5:49 - 5:54)
if if you're caring that much about (5:51 - 5:55)
remote raid passes and you're not using (5:54 - 5:57)
at least one a week (5:55 - 5:58)
maybe you don't actually care about (5:57 - 6:01)
remote rates (5:58 - 6:01)
like what are you saving them for i wait (6:01 - 6:07)
for my good friend steve to text me and (6:04 - 6:08)
it turns out (6:07 - 6:09)
ninety percent of the time he goes (6:08 - 6:11)

you didn't say that (6:27 - 6:31)
in the text all you said was (6:28 - 6:34)

the text message i believe (6:34 - 6:38)
is the word houndoom houndoom that is (6:35 - 6:41)
that is literally what we got texted (6:38 - 6:44)

autumn (7:51 - 7:54)
themed pokemon berries bonuses and (7:52 - 7:55)
deerling (7:54 - 7:58)
coming as the (7:55 - 8:02)
seasons change from friday october 9th (7:58 - 8:04)
through monday october 12th the the (8:02 - 8:05)
bullet points (8:04 - 8:09)
here are whether it's spring or autumn (8:05 - 8:11)
where you are plants are flourishing (8:09 - 8:13)
around the world during this (8:11 - 8:15)
event berries will be twice as effective (8:13 - 8:17)
when you give them as treats to your (8:15 - 8:18)
buddy (8:17 - 8:19)
you will earn twice the amount of candy (8:18 - 8:21)
you normally do when catching pokemon (8:19 - 8:23)
you pinapp (8:21 - 8:25)
berries will also drop more often from (8:23 - 8:27)
photodisc stops and (8:25 - 8:30)
gyms pokemon can sense the season (8:27 - 8:32)
changing you can expect the following (8:30 - 8:33)
pokemon more often the wild (8:32 - 8:37)
oddish vulpix bay leaf hoot (8:33 - 8:41)
sudowoodo yanma pineco (8:37 - 8:45)
dot shroomish plant cloak burme (8:41 - 8:49)
and fungus this list of pokemon makes no (8:45 - 8:51)
sense together (8:49 - 8:55)
they're all fair (8:51 - 8:56)
what do they have to do what does zigzag (8:55 - 8:58)
have to do with seasons changing (8:56 - 9:00)
i think zigzagoon is like the thing that (8:58 - 9:01)
collects the berries in (9:00 - 9:04)
hoenn right like a berry hoarder it's a (9:01 - 9:05)
raccoon (9:04 - 9:08)
they do they they collect trash (9:05 - 9:12)
all the time food (9:08 - 9:16)
i mushrooms grow yanma (9:12 - 9:19)
because it's like spring and growth and (9:16 - 9:23)
like bugs and wildlife and fruits and (9:19 - 9:25)
vegetables and plants (9:23 - 9:28)
pseudowudo is a rock but it would like (9:25 - 9:29)
to be a plant (9:28 - 9:33)
but it's a rock it should know what it (9:29 - 9:33)
is (9:33 - 9:36)
and stay in its lane dreams don't have (9:33 - 9:36)
to be (9:36 - 9:39)
based in reality that's why they are (9:36 - 9:40)
dreams look if you (9:39 - 9:43)
i can give you a multi-hour long lecture (9:40 - 9:45)
about how my dreams (9:43 - 9:47)
are clearly not based in any reality (9:45 - 9:48)
incorrect (9:47 - 9:51)
and yeah see you don't even need these (9:48 - 9:53)
texture you know my life i know (9:51 - 9:57)
i i am i watch a pseudo (9:53 - 10:00)
if you're lucky trainers you may (9:57 - 10:02)
encounter a shiny vulpix (10:00 - 10:04)
originally discovered in kanto that (10:02 - 10:06)
extra line is (10:04 - 10:09)
probably because there's been confusion (10:06 - 10:12)
around alolan vulpix (10:09 - 10:12)
uh autumn themed pokemon will be (10:12 - 10:16)
hatching from 5k eggs (10:14 - 10:18)
deerling the season pokemon will be (10:16 - 10:21)
making its pokemon go debut (10:18 - 10:23)
the turning of seasons changes the (10:21 - 10:25)
colors and the scent of this pokemon's (10:23 - 10:26)
fur keep an (10:25 - 10:30)

i mean they're gonna put it up as long (12:19 - 12:23)
as they can i have (12:21 - 12:26)
a logistical question here um (12:23 - 12:29)
is this is this going to cause the drama (12:26 - 12:31)
that's going on around it (12:29 - 12:34)
no my life is all drama i know (12:31 - 12:37)
is it possible in (12:34 - 12:41)
the world of pokemon to have (12:37 - 12:45)
a mel medal (12:41 - 12:48)
in pokemon go yeah yeah i have multiple (12:45 - 12:50)
models they're really good for team (12:48 - 12:53)
rocket i thought you had to send it (12:50 - 12:56)
to let's go for it to evolve no you (12:53 - 12:58)
cannot evolve meltan in let's go you (12:56 - 13:00)
have to evolve it before you send it (12:58 - 13:03)
yeah four billion candies (13:00 - 13:06)
yeah you had it backwards okay thank you (13:03 - 13:08)
for that (13:06 - 13:11)
piece of clarification protein what's (13:08 - 13:13)
the special we get for doing this (13:11 - 13:15)
hold on it doesn't say in here hold on (13:13 - 13:17)
pro tip (13:15 - 13:19)
the berry week you get double catch (13:17 - 13:20)
candy (13:19 - 13:23)
use your meltdan box during that week (13:20 - 13:26)
get the double candy on the mel tan (13:23 - 13:28)
then when the home integration comes out (13:26 - 13:30)
you got more mel medals than everyone (13:28 - 13:31)
else (13:30 - 13:32)
because you stocked up because you (13:31 - 13:34)
listen to the show and then you trade (13:32 - 13:35)
those male medals for the (13:34 - 13:37)
mythicals you're missing like the sarah (13:35 - 13:38)
aureus or the (13:37 - 13:41)
maguirnas or the vulcanians (13:38 - 13:45)
but anybody can get a male medal you are (13:41 - 13:47)
um let me tell you about twitch let me (13:45 - 13:48)
tell you how (13:47 - 13:51)
many people don't play go and beg people (13:48 - 13:53)
for mel medals because they don't want (13:51 - 13:54)
to play go to get it (13:53 - 13:57)
mel medal yeah is tradable (13:54 - 14:01)
is what i'm saying yeah now that you put (13:57 - 14:02)
it that way (14:01 - 14:04)
it's like but i know all those people (14:02 - 14:07)
that only play go who have mel metal (14:04 - 14:11)
and don't care i've got a shiny male (14:07 - 14:12)
medal and that (14:11 - 14:14)
i'm not trading that for nothing i think (14:12 - 14:17)
i have a shiny (14:14 - 14:19)
i don't care about it so there is (14:17 - 14:20)
something on the japanese website that (14:19 - 14:22)
people freaked out about and then it was (14:20 - 14:23)
later changed um (14:22 - 14:28)
but it seems like there is i'll (14:23 - 14:30)
i'll just say what it is now because (14:28 - 14:31)
what it was doesn't matter anymore (14:30 - 14:34)
what it is now is that there is uh an (14:31 - 14:36)
faq on the japanese website (14:34 - 14:39)
about pokemon go to home saying that (14:36 - 14:40)
there is a (14:39 - 14:43)
cooldown on sending pokemon from go to (14:40 - 14:44)
home (14:43 - 14:45)
and that there will be coins to (14:44 - 14:47)
alleviate the cooldown (14:45 - 14:49)
and that's pretty much all we know we (14:47 - 14:51)
don't know what the q the cooldown (14:49 - 14:52)
is we don't know how many pokemon you (14:51 - 14:54)
can send quote unquote for (14:52 - 14:58)
free we don't know if any of this has to (14:54 - 14:58)
do with the (14:58 - 15:02)
premium subscription for pokemon home (14:58 - 15:05)
which i think all three of us have yep (15:02 - 15:07)
and we don't know what the coin cost is (15:05 - 15:10)
i did a pretty artificial (15:07 - 15:13)
slash lame poll in my twitch chat (15:10 - 15:16)
uh the day that this was announcing you (15:13 - 15:17)
know just what people were comfortable (15:16 - 15:19)
with and (15:17 - 15:22)
almost everyone said that if it was five (15:19 - 15:24)
pokemon a day for free that you can (15:22 - 15:26)
transfer they would be completely happy (15:24 - 15:28)
with that (15:26 - 15:31)
and you know i don't know what the (15:28 - 15:33)
just guessing you know pay a hundred (15:31 - 15:34)
coins for (15:33 - 15:36)
another five otherwise you have to wait (15:34 - 15:38)
24 hours or you you know (15:36 - 15:42)
this is not new to any anything mobile (15:38 - 15:43)
at this point of (15:42 - 15:47)
paying coins to get rid of the countdown (15:43 - 15:49)
we all knew it was going to cost money (15:47 - 15:51)
right they charge you for (15:49 - 15:53)
storage and they want you to increase (15:51 - 15:54)
your storage (15:53 - 15:57)
in the game so the fact that there was (15:54 - 15:58)
going to be a coin (15:57 - 16:01)
cost shouldn't have been a surprise (15:58 - 16:02)
because why would they give up their (16:01 - 16:04)
cash cow of (16:02 - 16:06)
running out of space for whale (16:04 - 16:08)
collectors and not charge you money to (16:06 - 16:09)
move them (16:08 - 16:10)
i'm surprised there's any hint that (16:09 - 16:12)
there's going to be x amount that are (16:10 - 16:12)
free (16:12 - 16:14)
i definitely can't imagine they don't (16:12 - 16:16)
give a minimum (16:14 - 16:18)
one a day for free which i think is kind (16:16 - 16:20)
of lousy yeah (16:18 - 16:22)
i mean they probably give maybe one one (16:20 - 16:24)
a day for free but (16:22 - 16:27)
i mean one of their big money makers is (16:24 - 16:30)
increasing storage like that is one of (16:27 - 16:32)
the things they charge for there's a cap (16:30 - 16:33)
for that though (16:32 - 16:35)
eventually like what you're at what 4 (16:33 - 16:38)
000 yeah yeah yeah but like (16:35 - 16:40)
out of four years and they increase it (16:38 - 16:42)
what maybe a thousand (16:40 - 16:43)
not a thousand a year what is it like (16:42 - 16:46)
maybe on average 700 a year because (16:43 - 16:48)
we're four years it's caps at like three (16:46 - 16:49)
i don't even know how much you start (16:48 - 16:51)
with storage wise what 400 (16:49 - 16:53)
yeah something like that i think they (16:51 - 16:55)
make way more money off incubators and (16:53 - 16:56)
way more money off raid passes than they (16:55 - 16:57)
do storage (16:56 - 16:59)
because there's there's no ceiling on (16:57 - 17:02)
that i mean probably but also (16:59 - 17:04)
i mean that is one of their things like (17:02 - 17:05)
every community day i'm like (17:04 - 17:09)
do i dump a bunch of stuff or do i buy (17:05 - 17:10)
some storage today (17:09 - 17:12)
and sometimes i buy storage and (17:10 - 17:14)
sometimes i bunch up i bet most of the (17:12 - 17:15)
times you buy storage because i'm in the (17:14 - 17:17)
same exact situation (17:15 - 17:18)
most of the time you buy storage is (17:17 - 17:21)
because you don't want to put the time (17:18 - 17:23)
into looking through your old pokemon to (17:21 - 17:26)
figure out which ones to delete (17:23 - 17:29)
correct so it is (17:26 - 17:32)
it is it is every way they seem to make (17:29 - 17:33)
money is (17:32 - 17:37)
purely off time in your time like i (17:33 - 17:38)
don't want to wait for this (17:37 - 17:40)
i don't want i don't want to do this (17:38 - 17:43)
today right so i will rather pay the two (17:40 - 17:44)
dollars (17:43 - 17:46)
so i don't have to spend 10 minutes to (17:44 - 17:49)
look through my old pokemon (17:46 - 17:52)
but i mean we know that i mean i (17:49 - 17:53)
there are a bunch of people that were (17:52 - 17:55)
shocked that it was gonna cost that (17:53 - 17:56)
there was going to be a cost to it and i (17:55 - 17:58)
don't know what company they think (17:56 - 18:00)
they're dealing with (17:58 - 18:03)
yeah and i i made this point and (18:00 - 18:05)
not a lot of people like the point but (18:03 - 18:07)
you know if you wanted jirachi (18:05 - 18:10)
back on back in the day you remember (18:07 - 18:11)
this greg (18:10 - 18:13)
i still have that disc you you there's (18:11 - 18:14)
one way to get jarachi (18:13 - 18:18)
for six years i looked it up from (18:14 - 18:20)
the coliseum bonus disc to the first (18:18 - 18:21)
distribution (18:20 - 18:23)
in the u.s to everyone else the only way (18:21 - 18:24)
for six (18:23 - 18:26)
years was the coliseum bonus disc so not (18:24 - 18:28)
only did you have to buy a 60 (18:26 - 18:31)
sorry 50 spin-off game coliseum (18:28 - 18:33)
whether or not you like that that's not (18:31 - 18:34)
the point then (18:33 - 18:38)
you had to buy a 20 specific adapter (18:34 - 18:39)
it wasn't the link cable it was the (18:38 - 18:43)
gamecube to game boy advance adapter (18:39 - 18:46)
just to get one pokemon (18:43 - 18:49)
into your copy of ruby and sapphire yep (18:46 - 18:50)
you could get more (18:49 - 18:53)
but that was the only way to get jarachi (18:50 - 18:54)
for six years (18:53 - 18:57)
so i i i guess the argument is and then (18:54 - 18:59)
people are like well that was only a one (18:57 - 18:59)
cost (18:59 - 19:02)
fee yeah one cost fee for one pokemon (18:59 - 19:03)
the point i'm making (19:02 - 19:07)
is this is this this is this company (19:03 - 19:10)
has been nickel and diming people yeah (19:07 - 19:13)
for 20 plus years and i feel like with (19:10 - 19:14)
go (19:13 - 19:16)
people are like finally seeing that but (19:14 - 19:18)
it's always been there (19:16 - 19:20)
because it's more frequent now but it's (19:18 - 19:21)
way more frequent now (19:20 - 19:25)
yeah like you could find so i mean (19:21 - 19:27)
if you had a bunch of friends like let's (19:25 - 19:28)
admit it when you were a kid if one (19:27 - 19:30)
friend had that bonus disc (19:28 - 19:32)
and one family made that investment you (19:30 - 19:34)
could give that doubt to all your (19:32 - 19:34)
friends (19:34 - 19:38)
you were the hero right you were the one (19:34 - 19:38)
getting (19:38 - 19:40)
you were the one getting the bribes you (19:38 - 19:42)
were the one getting to borrow the good (19:40 - 19:45)
video games from your friends (19:42 - 19:47)
yeah you were the hero there are no (19:45 - 19:48)
heroes in this one (19:47 - 19:52)
there are no heroes in moving your own (19:48 - 19:55)
stuff to home until you get your shiny (19:52 - 19:56)
mail medal that you're going to trade (19:55 - 19:58)
for their (19:56 - 20:00)
aura or whatever you want the other (19:58 - 20:02)
question though is how much are people (20:00 - 20:03)
dumping (20:02 - 20:05)
you could be like well i have you know (20:03 - 20:07)
300 chinese and (20:05 - 20:09)
i'm i'm close to a free-to-play player (20:07 - 20:10)
so i don't have that much storage so (20:09 - 20:12)
yeah i want to dump the shinies (20:10 - 20:14)
i'm dumping the minute i can i am (20:12 - 20:17)
dumping all my shinies out of go (20:14 - 20:20)
like they are just sitting in there yeah (20:17 - 20:21)
doing (20:20 - 20:24)
absolutely nothing but you want to you (20:21 - 20:25)
want to hear a funny story (20:24 - 20:28)
that's that that i don't know it's funny (20:25 - 20:28)
to me (20:28 - 20:30)
the last time greg and i were together (20:28 - 20:33)
in person in the same place (20:30 - 20:36)
collecting porygons i i ran out of (20:33 - 20:38)
storage in pokemon go (20:36 - 20:40)
i got a little alert on my screen cannot (20:38 - 20:42)
capture any more pokemon you're out of (20:40 - 20:43)
space and i was like (20:42 - 20:45)
greg let's go sit on a bench for a few (20:43 - 20:47)
minutes so i can clean out my (20:45 - 20:49)
pokemon storage and make some room for (20:47 - 20:51)
some more porygons (20:49 - 20:53)
fine that's you know a natural reaction (20:51 - 20:55)
to the situation (20:53 - 20:56)
and the way that i clean out my storage (20:55 - 20:58)
is like i feel like i only need (20:56 - 21:04)
one of every pokemon so if i've got 200 (20:58 - 21:07)
patrat you know i keep one and (21:04 - 21:11)
199 go goodbye but here's the thing (21:07 - 21:12)
as i'm sitting there clearing out my (21:11 - 21:14)
pokemon storage (21:12 - 21:17)
greg is staring out into space enjoying (21:14 - 21:18)
the day (21:17 - 21:21)
he could have taken that opportunity (21:18 - 21:24)
to clear out his own storage i had (21:21 - 21:25)
already cleared out (21:24 - 21:28)
my own storage before we had arrived (21:25 - 21:28)
sure (21:28 - 21:30)
and i had purchased extra storage you (21:28 - 21:32)
were at brunch with me before we had (21:30 - 21:33)
arrived (21:32 - 21:36)
i'm talking about earlier in the day i (21:33 - 21:37)
have a life in this (21:36 - 21:41)
house i was prepared i think that (21:37 - 21:45)
there will be a 1 to ten (21:41 - 21:47)
me speculating i think it would be one (21:45 - 21:49)
to ten pokemon that you can move for (21:47 - 21:50)
free (21:49 - 21:53)
i think one is very stingy i think (21:50 - 21:56)
ten is actually pretty awesome and i (21:53 - 21:58)
think five is (21:56 - 22:01)
is is a good number you're saying per (21:58 - 22:02)
day right per day (22:01 - 22:05)
so you transfer you transfer your five (22:02 - 22:07)
shiny porygon (22:05 - 22:11)
to home and then there's a cool down and (22:07 - 22:12)
you gotta pay (22:11 - 22:14)
if you if you're impatient and you pay a (22:12 - 22:15)
hundred coins (22:14 - 22:17)
it alleviates the cooldown i don't know (22:15 - 22:19)
if it's 100 coins i'm just guessing (22:17 - 22:22)
i think though they need to still (22:19 - 22:26)
make anything that touches home (22:22 - 22:28)
they still have to make that worth it to (22:26 - 22:30)
premium (22:28 - 22:33)
players why am i premium (22:30 - 22:36)
if i'm not getting special treatment (22:33 - 22:37)
well you're getting (22:36 - 22:39)
five million boxes at home that's your (22:37 - 22:41)
special treatment (22:39 - 22:43)
so what do you want greedy if the (22:41 - 22:44)
pokemon company (22:43 - 22:47)
was smart i would argue that for the (22:44 - 22:48)
most part (22:47 - 22:51)
i would say yes because opinions vary (22:48 - 22:52)
because they continue to make money off (22:51 - 22:54)
of all of us if the pokemon (22:52 - 22:56)
company was smart they want to keep (22:54 - 22:58)
adding hooks (22:56 - 23:02)
every way they can to convince a user (22:58 - 23:06)
to get premium because that is 16 (23:02 - 23:08)
a year probably for the rest of our (23:06 - 23:09)
lives (23:08 - 23:12)
unless at some point we just go you know (23:09 - 23:12)
what (23:12 - 23:15)
i don't care about pokemon anymore i'm (23:12 - 23:17)
walking away from the entire series (23:15 - 23:21)
no once you have (23:17 - 23:23)
thousands of pokemon in home you're (23:21 - 23:25)
paying for those memories to be (23:23 - 23:26)
alive because you can't move them (23:25 - 23:28)
anywhere else i mean i guess you could (23:26 - 23:30)
dump the ones you care about into sword (23:28 - 23:32)
and shield and then (23:30 - 23:34)
hope your switch doesn't break because (23:32 - 23:36)
there's no backup solution for (23:34 - 23:38)
sword and shield but it's just like the (23:36 - 23:40)
netflix thing or the google photos thing (23:38 - 23:44)
or the hulu thing of how do we make it (23:40 - 23:45)
so you continue paying (23:44 - 23:48)
and or forget that you have a (23:45 - 23:49)
subscription here (23:48 - 23:53)
i just can't see them not giving (23:49 - 23:55)
any benefit to a premium person i mean i (23:53 - 23:56)
guess they could not (23:55 - 24:00)
and just i mean i would imagine that (23:56 - 24:03)
a premium person would probably get the (24:00 - 24:03)
same (24:03 - 24:06)
as uh an upgrade cost so you could move (24:03 - 24:07)
50 (24:06 - 24:11)
for free a day yeah the the other thing (24:07 - 24:11)
too (24:11 - 24:13)
is they could be like hey it's gonna be (24:11 - 24:14)
one a day (24:13 - 24:16)
and then in like six months they're (24:14 - 24:17)
gonna be like hey it's three a day and (24:16 - 24:19)
then in a year it's gonna be like hey (24:17 - 24:21)
it's five a day because then a year is (24:19 - 24:23)
like just dump it yeah because (24:21 - 24:26)
that's what ultimately happens right if (24:23 - 24:27)
they allowed everyone to dump all their (24:26 - 24:28)
pokemon (24:27 - 24:30)
okay on december 31st when it goes live (24:28 - 24:31)
everyone dumps their pokemon okay no one (24:30 - 24:32)
uses this (24:31 - 24:36)
now for the next year (24:32 - 24:36)
so if they're preventing a server (24:36 - 24:41)
overload with this (24:38 - 24:41)
i can see an opposite issue if if they (24:42 - 24:50)
give a bonus to the pokemon home (24:46 - 24:54)
premium people all of the pokemon home (24:50 - 24:56)
premium people that don't play pokemon (24:54 - 24:58)
go and don't have anything to transfer (24:56 - 24:58)
are (24:58 - 25:02)
going to say what do i get out of this (24:58 - 25:03)
there should there probably be a (25:02 - 25:06)
distribution right what was the thing (25:03 - 25:06)
before (25:06 - 25:09)
if you transferred from bank to home and (25:06 - 25:11)
you were premium you got like a rotom (25:09 - 25:12)
and an eevee and uh (25:11 - 25:13)
yeah but what if i just don't play (25:12 - 25:15)
pokemon go i mean we know what the (25:13 - 25:17)
the thing is you're going to be able to (25:15 - 25:19)
gigantomax your mill metal (25:17 - 25:23)
yeah but like i don't i don't play go (25:19 - 25:25)
so i mean i do play go but i'm like the (25:23 - 25:27)
hypothetical like i (25:25 - 25:30)
only ever played the video games never (25:27 - 25:31)
played go (25:30 - 25:33)
i i pay for premium because i love all (25:31 - 25:35)
my pokemons i want to keep them forever (25:33 - 25:37)
now you're giving a special bonus to (25:35 - 25:38)
pokemon go players (25:37 - 25:40)
but they already did that what do i get (25:38 - 25:42)
i pay the same amount (25:40 - 25:43)
yeah i don't know if that matters that (25:42 - 25:46)
much because like uh if the only way to (25:43 - 25:47)
get melt and mail metal unless you were (25:46 - 25:49)
to trade was to play go and then (25:47 - 25:50)
transfer it into let's go (25:49 - 25:54)
and then let's go into home (25:50 - 25:56)
and i don't think let's go i don't think (25:54 - 25:57)
let's go (25:56 - 26:00)
convinced any non-pokemon players to (25:57 - 26:02)
play pokemon go (26:00 - 26:04)
i mean i i feel like a lot of the (26:02 - 26:06)
non-pokemon go players i talk to (26:04 - 26:08)
they just don't have a phone that's good (26:06 - 26:09)
enough and they don't care about having (26:08 - 26:11)
a phone that's good enough (26:09 - 26:13)
hmm i don't think i i don't think i've (26:11 - 26:14)
ever ran into (26:13 - 26:18)
like a a pokemon fan with like an iphone (26:14 - 26:21)
10 being like i'm i'm sure i'm sure that (26:18 - 26:22)
person exists (26:21 - 26:25)
but i feel like every non-pokemon go (26:22 - 26:27)
player is like (26:25 - 26:28)
oh i just have a budget phone and i (26:27 - 26:30)
don't really care about upgrading my (26:28 - 26:31)
phone (26:30 - 26:34)
true all right rough math it would it (26:31 - 26:34)
costs (26:34 - 26:38)
a hundred and six dollars roughly (26:34 - 26:41)
to go from your starting 300 storage to (26:38 - 26:43)
the 3000 max (26:41 - 26:46)
106 yep (26:43 - 26:50)
yikes so i mean that's not nothing (26:46 - 26:53)
no it's not but a hundred dollars out of (26:50 - 26:55)
four years (26:53 - 26:58)
whereas like i'm sure the whales (26:55 - 27:01)
a hundred dollars out of four years for (26:58 - 27:02)
just (27:01 - 27:05)
one part of the game i would say it's a (27:02 - 27:05)
pretty (27:05 - 27:07)
important part of the game though but (27:05 - 27:09)
when most (27:07 - 27:12)
aaa games are still in the 60 range that (27:09 - 27:13)
is a good (27:12 - 27:16)
deal that's like a lot of that's like a (27:13 - 27:17)
good deal for them they are getting more (27:16 - 27:18)
than a triple (27:17 - 27:22)
a game for for a game that has (27:18 - 27:24)
many other reasons to spend money in it (27:22 - 27:25)
how many people do you think actually (27:24 - 27:27)
maximize their storage though (27:25 - 27:30)
people who paid for premium for home a (27:27 - 27:31)
lot of them (27:30 - 27:33)
i would love we should do it we should (27:31 - 27:35)
do some sort of poll i would love to see (27:33 - 27:36)
how many people (27:35 - 27:39)
i would i would bet a lot of people (27:36 - 27:41)
have probably upgraded their storage but (27:39 - 27:43)
not to the max (27:41 - 27:45)
i mean i haven't upgraded to the max but (27:43 - 27:46)
i have definitely upgraded my storage (27:45 - 27:49)
yeah so i mean if you're talking about (27:46 - 27:52)
giving a benefit the 1699 (27:49 - 27:54)
versus the 106 that they charge to max (27:52 - 27:55)
out your storage (27:54 - 27:57)
there's going to be a balance there (27:55 - 27:59)
somewhere my prop my problem is this (27:57 - 27:59)
though (27:59 - 28:03)
i have 5 000 pokemon (27:59 - 28:06)
in home and i have three thousand (28:03 - 28:07)
pokemon in go (28:06 - 28:09)
and i used to be the person that was (28:07 - 28:12)
like oh i want one of every pokemon in (28:09 - 28:16)
go but i but i have one of every pokemon (28:12 - 28:18)
at home so why do i need two of every (28:16 - 28:18)
pokemon (28:18 - 28:21)
you don't at that point like my only (28:18 - 28:22)
thought process is one i (28:21 - 28:24)
i need to clean up my pokemon home (28:22 - 28:26)
before this happens because (28:24 - 28:29)
i'm very limited and (28:26 - 28:33)
why i don't need one non-shiny weedle in (28:29 - 28:36)
home and one non-shiny weedle in go what (28:33 - 28:37)
am i gonna do with that non-shiny wheel (28:36 - 28:38)
am i gonna meet somebody that's gonna be (28:37 - 28:40)
like i don't have a weedle and i'm gonna (28:38 - 28:40)
be like well (28:40 - 28:42)
it's your lucky day buddy i got one do (28:40 - 28:45)
you want a tray i got one so if they won (28:42 - 28:48)
if anything i dump so i have i have (28:45 - 28:49)
close to 800 shinies (28:48 - 28:53)
so i probably dump 600 of them into (28:49 - 28:56)
into home (28:53 - 28:59)
and then i have how many legendaries (28:56 - 29:00)
because i refuse to throw away a (28:59 - 29:01)
legendary (29:00 - 29:04)
i have 400 legendaries so that's a (29:01 - 29:06)
thousand pokemon between (29:04 - 29:08)
chinese and wait you have 400 (29:06 - 29:10)
legendaries in pokemon go (29:08 - 29:12)
yeah i've never thrown them away do it (29:10 - 29:15)
with your life (29:12 - 29:15)
no this is 12 (29:15 - 29:20)
minutes (29:19 - 29:24)
[Applause] (29:20 - 29:24)
what (29:25 - 29:28)
let's imagine that each one of those (29:26 - 29:30)
legendaries costed a dollar (29:28 - 29:34)
oh gosh i that's a lot of money okay (29:30 - 29:38)
here's what am i gonna do with nothing (29:34 - 29:38)
when niantic reaches the end days we are (29:38 - 29:43)
not trading these things to get food (29:41 - 29:44)
they (29:43 - 29:46)
are just for us and our memories and (29:44 - 29:48)
your emotional attachment mister i would (29:46 - 29:49)
pay any money (29:48 - 29:51)
to get my wedding photos back that's all (29:49 - 29:52)
right (29:51 - 29:54)
thousands of people would though i know (29:52 - 29:56)
but okay here's the thing though (29:54 - 29:58)
we also have like if you're gonna do (29:56 - 30:01)
your poll like how many people just play (29:58 - 30:02)
pokemon go (30:01 - 30:06)
and nothing else like is home is a (30:02 - 30:07)
premium for home (30:06 - 30:10)
a 16.99 enough of (30:07 - 30:13)
to get what is it three thousand more (30:10 - 30:15)
stories six thousand (30:13 - 30:17)
six thousand more storage i mean that's (30:15 - 30:19)
a way better price than trying to (30:17 - 30:22)
upgrade all of go (30:19 - 30:24)
yeah but you're not upgrading there's a (30:22 - 30:25)
difference between upgrading your (30:24 - 30:27)
storage and go and upgrading your (30:25 - 30:28)
storage at home because (30:27 - 30:32)
in go you still see and access those (30:28 - 30:33)
pokemon in home (30:32 - 30:35)
it's a one-way trip they don't come back (30:33 - 30:36)
yeah but (30:35 - 30:39)
what are they going to do with them i've (30:36 - 30:40)
been asking myself that question for (30:39 - 30:41)
four years what am i doing (30:40 - 30:43)
with all these pokemon do we have (30:41 - 30:45)
confirmation that you're not going to be (30:43 - 30:45)
able to (30:45 - 30:47)
transfer things from home back to go yes (30:45 - 30:49)
yeah they've confirmed that oh (30:47 - 30:52)
yeah but i mean so they have a living (30:49 - 30:52)
dex (30:52 - 30:55)
like they have one of everything normal (30:52 - 30:56)
so the (30:55 - 30:58)
the other they just have is why would (30:56 - 31:00)
not move it over you cannot train this (30:58 - 31:02)
is the other thing you cannot transfer a (31:00 - 31:02)
pokemon (31:02 - 31:05)
from go to home unless it's already (31:02 - 31:07)
registered at home (31:05 - 31:09)
so you just can't dump these pokemon you (31:07 - 31:10)
need what does that mean (31:09 - 31:13)
translate that into okay so i have i (31:10 - 31:14)
have (31:13 - 31:17)
52 deoxys sitting gosh (31:14 - 31:20)
52 deoxys sitting in my pokemon home (31:17 - 31:22)
right i did 52 raids to get a shiny (31:20 - 31:25)
i got the shiny 52 400 this is why i (31:22 - 31:25)
have (31:25 - 31:28)
400 and i cannot transfer (31:25 - 31:32)
any of those deoxys unless in my pokemon (31:28 - 31:32)
home (31:32 - 31:35)
i have registered adeoxis already (31:32 - 31:38)
yeah from another game from another (31:35 - 31:38)
non-go (31:38 - 31:42)
game so oh my god yeah (31:38 - 31:44)
it's wild because that's probably what (31:42 - 31:46)
they don't want (31:44 - 31:48)
they don't want look they've always been (31:46 - 31:49)
really weird (31:48 - 31:52)
this is not niantic right we are all in (31:49 - 31:53)
agreement that this is the pokemon (31:52 - 31:54)
company (31:53 - 31:56)
this is the same company that was like (31:54 - 31:57)
you want to move pokemon from gen 4 to (31:56 - 31:58)
gen 5 (31:57 - 32:01)
shoot some bow and arrows into a bush (31:58 - 32:03)
and get those pokemon over like (32:01 - 32:05)
they're the weirdest company when it (32:03 - 32:07)
comes to transferring your pokemon i (32:05 - 32:08)
don't i mean (32:07 - 32:10)
the legendary thing makes a lot more (32:08 - 32:12)
sense with crown tundra (32:10 - 32:15)
right because every legendary is gonna (32:12 - 32:16)
be in there (32:15 - 32:19)
so in that way not being able to (32:16 - 32:21)
transform over until you have it (32:19 - 32:24)
is a a weird encouragement to buy this (32:21 - 32:25)
dlc (32:24 - 32:27)
and play this other game because all of (32:25 - 32:29)
the legendaries are going to be in there (32:27 - 32:32)
all of them so there will be no problem (32:29 - 32:34)
moving them into (32:32 - 32:36)
home at that point yeah and you're (32:34 - 32:38)
probably not going to be able to uh (32:36 - 32:41)
move over like mew or victini or celebi (32:38 - 32:42)
because you only get one (32:41 - 32:45)
right but like genesect darkrai zapdos (32:42 - 32:46)
mewtwo like those should be (32:45 - 32:49)
fine i don't think any of the costumes (32:46 - 32:50)
are coming over i don't think armor (32:49 - 32:51)
mewtwo or (32:50 - 32:55)
uh milady shanks is gonna come over (32:51 - 32:57)
oh i think they will why wouldn't they (32:55 - 32:59)
they specifically say (32:57 - 33:01)
that you know not all i think they (32:59 - 33:02)
specifically say some costume pokemon (33:01 - 33:04)
will not move over (33:02 - 33:07)
yeah flower garland ones (33:04 - 33:09)
i mean that's sort of a weird limit (33:07 - 33:11)
since it can't go into any other game (33:09 - 33:13)
like why wouldn't you just put it in (33:11 - 33:15)
home because i feel like at this point (33:13 - 33:16)
i'm valuing my (33:15 - 33:18)
vap putting more value in my 6 000 home (33:16 - 33:20)
storage than i have my 3 000 pokemon co (33:18 - 33:22)
storage (33:20 - 33:24)
yeah i mean like once once i can start (33:22 - 33:26)
dumping pokemon whether that's five a (33:24 - 33:27)
day or ten a day or one a day (33:26 - 33:30)
um i think it's just gonna lead to me (33:27 - 33:31)
deleting (33:30 - 33:34)
just more pokemon that i (33:31 - 33:36)
wouldn't have normally deleted in go (33:34 - 33:39)
like why am i holding on to all these (33:36 - 33:40)
unknown (33:39 - 33:42)
like i mean i'm holding on to them (33:40 - 33:44)
because everyone smile i need to trade (33:42 - 33:45)
them and it's a good thing to trade but (33:44 - 33:46)
yeah (33:45 - 33:49)
but why am i why am i holding on to like (33:46 - 33:51)
four nine tails unless like the nine (33:49 - 33:53)
tails is lucky or unless that nine tails (33:51 - 33:53)
is like (33:53 - 33:57)
good for taking out gyms it's (33:53 - 33:59)
really easy to get nine tails in (33:57 - 34:03)
literally any main series pokemon game (33:59 - 34:03)
but yeah i wanted the thing where i (34:04 - 34:07)
wanted the thing where i wanted one of (34:06 - 34:09)
every pokemon in (34:07 - 34:12)
in go at that point i'm just eating my (34:09 - 34:13)
own storage (34:12 - 34:15)
and i'm not doing anything with them and (34:13 - 34:17)
i probably don't plan on trading them (34:15 - 34:19)
there are some pokemon i hold on to to (34:17 - 34:21)
trade like (34:19 - 34:22)
i don't know of course a lot i guess (34:21 - 34:23)
that's like completing your there are (34:22 - 34:25)
still benefits and more probably still (34:23 - 34:25)
be (34:25 - 34:28)
benefits in completing your pokedexes in (34:25 - 34:28)
go (34:28 - 34:31)
like they've done that before so there (34:28 - 34:33)
was a reason to be able to complete that (34:31 - 34:34)
but (34:33 - 34:37)
i mean holding them after that like you (34:34 - 34:38)
there's never been a requirement to hold (34:37 - 34:39)
on to them (34:38 - 34:41)
right i mean the other thing i would do (34:39 - 34:43)
too is like (34:41 - 34:47)
uh i have um like one shiny (34:43 - 34:50)
uh what's a shiny that i have that like (34:47 - 34:52)
i have one shiny coughing for example (34:50 - 34:54)
in pokemon i'm not going to trade it (34:52 - 34:56)
it's my only one (34:54 - 34:58)
i'm not going to use it for battles (34:56 - 35:00)
because it's garbage stats (34:58 - 35:01)
what am i going to do with it so my (35:00 - 35:03)
thought process is well i don't have the (35:01 - 35:05)
shiny decks (35:03 - 35:08)
entry for wheezing in go (35:05 - 35:10)
so if i don't have the dex entry and i (35:08 - 35:12)
don't plan on trading it (35:10 - 35:14)
and i don't plan on using it in battles (35:12 - 35:15)
why don't i just evolve it (35:14 - 35:17)
get the dex entry and then transfer it (35:15 - 35:18)
into home (35:17 - 35:21)
because otherwise if i just transfer it (35:18 - 35:22)
i still don't have a shiny wheezing (35:21 - 35:23)
registered (35:22 - 35:24)
so now i gotta find another shiny (35:23 - 35:26)
coughing same thought process probably (35:24 - 35:28)
gonna be bad for raids (35:26 - 35:30)
bad for gyms and then before anyone says (35:28 - 35:32)
well you can put shinies in gyms and (35:30 - 35:33)
flex (35:32 - 35:35)
we still caring about that after four (35:33 - 35:37)
years (35:35 - 35:38)
we never cared about that at the (35:37 - 35:41)
beginning so the only gyms at this point (35:38 - 35:42)
that impressed me (35:41 - 35:44)
are gyms that follow some sort of theme (35:42 - 35:46)
like oh cool all these pokemon are blue (35:44 - 35:48)
or like oh cool all these pokemon are (35:46 - 35:49)
fish (35:48 - 35:51)
oh cool all these pokemon are blue and (35:49 - 35:52)
our fish (35:51 - 35:54)
good to see you basculin i think this (35:52 - 35:57)
whole thing is just (35:54 - 35:59)
wrapped up in disappointment left right (35:57 - 36:01)
center (35:59 - 36:02)
there's like no way you can look at it (36:01 - 36:04)
without being disappointed (36:02 - 36:07)
i mean i'm excited to free up space (36:04 - 36:10)
i mean i'm blessed that i can't dump all (36:07 - 36:12)
my sunglasses squirtles (36:10 - 36:14)
but but we also live in a world where (36:12 - 36:15)
it's like (36:14 - 36:17)
we we we were going to buy premium (36:15 - 36:19)
anyways (36:17 - 36:21)
right we're gonna we're gonna buy in (36:19 - 36:23)
we've already bought in we've bought in (36:21 - 36:24)
with our souls (36:23 - 36:27)
greg i know steve obviously 400 (36:24 - 36:28)
legendaries (36:27 - 36:29)
i mean each and every one of those is (36:28 - 36:31)
like a raid (36:29 - 36:34)
yeah yeah or a special research (36:31 - 36:35)
completion (36:34 - 36:37)
to be fair that's only like 100 (36:35 - 36:39)
legendaries a year to be (36:37 - 36:42)
fair that's a hundred dollars a year (36:39 - 36:44)
that could have gone to charity (36:42 - 36:47)
yeah or our salaries this is so (36:44 - 36:51)
going into velocity hey (36:47 - 36:53)
if you guys are if you guys are missing (36:51 - 36:55)

maybe because i always had full gifts (39:00 - 39:03)
you will still have a higher chance of (39:02 - 39:05)
getting gifts when you spend a pokestop (39:03 - 39:07)
however you won't be guaranteed a gift (39:05 - 39:09)
incubators will be included in more (39:07 - 39:11)
boxes in the in-game shop (39:09 - 39:12)
for a summary of active bonuses keep (39:11 - 39:14)
your eyes on special additionally we are (39:12 - 39:16)
monitoring the (39:14 - 39:18)
global situation and we will work hard (39:16 - 39:20)
to reschedule previous planned live (39:18 - 39:22)
events for 2021. (39:20 - 39:24)
health and safety are important be aware (39:22 - 39:26)
of your surroundings (39:24 - 39:28)
so we don't have to spend we don't have (39:26 - 39:30)
to focus on how (39:28 - 39:33)
the pandemic is still here i don't think (39:30 - 39:35)
a lot of people want to hear that and (39:33 - 39:37)
but and still upswinging it has gone up (39:35 - 39:38)
recently (39:37 - 39:42)
the timing on this pretty not great (39:38 - 39:45)
pretty bad i think pretty dumb i think (39:42 - 39:47)
the big thing people were upset about (39:45 - 39:50)
was the in the incense itself i think if (39:47 - 39:53)
niantic came out and they said (39:50 - 39:55)
everything but the incense i actually (39:53 - 39:57)
don't think people would have cared (39:55 - 39:59)
no because eggs are still garbage if if (39:57 - 40:00)
you're buying (39:59 - 40:03)
eggs you're a sucker or not eggs (40:00 - 40:06)
you're buying incubators yes there (40:03 - 40:08)
hasn't really been anything good in eggs (40:06 - 40:09)
recently (40:08 - 40:11)
i guess they put the bow smooch them in (40:09 - 40:13)
eggs but there's like a (40:11 - 40:15)
there's like a spin three poke stop that (40:13 - 40:17)
will get you both moonshine so you can (40:15 - 40:20)
get smooch them without needing to hatch (40:17 - 40:22)
maybe i don't know maybe the people (40:20 - 40:23)
buying incubators just really like the (40:22 - 40:25)
bass i'm not (40:23 - 40:27)
sure but i don't like feet bass so i (40:25 - 40:29)
don't need to spend money to see (40:27 - 40:32)
feedback more often in my day (40:29 - 40:35)
but i think the i think the incense was (40:32 - 40:36)
the big thing people were upset about (40:35 - 40:38)
and i think the timing on this was very (40:36 - 40:39)
poor (40:38 - 40:41)
although knowing the pokemon company and (40:39 - 40:42)
niantic (40:41 - 40:45)
they probably planned this a month or (40:42 - 40:46)
two ago (40:45 - 40:50)
yep true which sort of (40:46 - 40:52)
you know and things weren't awful well (40:50 - 40:54)
things are yeah things have been bad (40:52 - 40:56)
but they weren't they weren't as bad as (40:54 - 40:57)
they are now yeah but (40:56 - 40:58)
if you're gonna say that you're (40:57 - 41:00)
continuously monitoring the ever (40:58 - 41:01)
evolving global event (41:00 - 41:03)
and every outlet and everything is (41:01 - 41:05)
saying there is going to be a fall (41:03 - 41:08)
uptick and that winter is going to be (41:05 - 41:09)
awful (41:08 - 41:11)
because it's all back to enclosed spaces (41:09 - 41:12)
then you (41:11 - 41:14)
then you would have known that going (41:12 - 41:15)
into this here's the thing that's (41:14 - 41:17)
frustrating about the incest (41:15 - 41:20)
incense thing not only is it only (41:17 - 41:21)
affecting like (41:20 - 41:24)
only while walking but people who have (41:21 - 41:26)
difficulty walking or difficulty moving (41:24 - 41:29)
or anybody who had who where that is a (41:26 - 41:32)
barrier we're getting a huge benefit out (41:29 - 41:33)
of this game (41:32 - 41:36)
that is now gone for no (41:33 - 41:40)
really good reason like that well money (41:36 - 41:42)
i mean money for that but you still were (41:40 - 41:44)
buying money for incense (41:42 - 41:47)
so the increased effectiveness of (41:44 - 41:50)
incense while walking hits (41:47 - 41:54)
on multiple bad levels not just like hey (41:50 - 41:57)
get out and walk but for people who (41:54 - 41:58)
can't do that (41:57 - 42:01)
this momentary wonderful thing is now (41:58 - 42:02)
just taken away from them (42:01 - 42:05)
again for not a great reason other than (42:02 - 42:06)
money (42:05 - 42:09)
it's kind of a really bad decision so i (42:06 - 42:11)
think if the pokemon company slash (42:09 - 42:13)
niantic would have expanded on this i (42:11 - 42:14)
think people would have been less (42:13 - 42:18)
mad prior to the bonuses what would (42:14 - 42:18)
happen with an (42:18 - 42:22)
incense is if you were not moving and it (42:18 - 42:23)
lasted 30 minutes you would get (42:22 - 42:26)
one pokemon spawn every five minutes (42:23 - 42:28)
that is what was (42:26 - 42:30)
never never been confirmed by the (42:28 - 42:32)
pokemon company never been confirmed by (42:30 - 42:33)
niantic but (42:32 - 42:37)
it doesn't take a a data programmer to (42:33 - 42:40)
sit in a spot turn on an incense and (42:37 - 42:40)
then count (42:40 - 42:43)
okay five minutes i get a spawn five (42:40 - 42:44)
minutes i get a spawn now when you were (42:43 - 42:46)
moving with an incense (42:44 - 42:49)
it changed from five minutes to i think (42:46 - 42:52)
three minutes if i remember correctly (42:49 - 42:53)
it's been so long (42:52 - 42:55)
so if you were moving it was still (42:53 - 42:57)
terrible every three minutes (42:55 - 43:00)
you get 10 and not 10 and 30 minutes (42:57 - 43:01)
otherwise you get 6 and 30 minutes or (43:00 - 43:03)
something like that (43:01 - 43:05)
when they changed it to an hour you (43:03 - 43:06)
would get one (43:05 - 43:09)
spawn every 60 seconds if i remember (43:06 - 43:11)
correctly (43:09 - 43:14)
people have tested this new incense (43:11 - 43:18)
as of october 1st and this is this is (43:14 - 43:18)
the big (43:18 - 43:21)
communication flaw here this is what it (43:18 - 43:21)
says on (43:21 - 43:24)
niantic's official website the increased (43:21 - 43:26)
infectedness of incense will now only (43:24 - 43:28)
apply while walking (43:26 - 43:30)
that's not true though so what we know (43:28 - 43:32)
now is if you are sitting still (43:30 - 43:36)
in your house not moving the new incense (43:32 - 43:40)
is every 90 seconds significantly better (43:36 - 43:42)
than the five minutes what it was before (43:40 - 43:45)
not as good as the 60 seconds so if (43:42 - 43:46)
niantic (43:45 - 43:50)
just said this people wouldn't be that (43:46 - 43:52)
upset because it's not that bad (43:50 - 43:54)
it's not that bad it's it's not that (43:52 - 43:56)
good it's not great the timing (43:54 - 44:00)
the timing not so much (43:56 - 44:02)
the timing of it but also the (44:00 - 44:03)
accessibility of it (44:02 - 44:06)
like just (44:03 - 44:06)
just understand like like this one thing (44:07 - 44:13)
helped a lot of people and (44:10 - 44:16)
changing it back is just there's no (44:13 - 44:18)
great reason to have done that (44:16 - 44:20)
even if even if you came out and said (44:18 - 44:22)
hey we're dropping it to 90 seconds (44:20 - 44:24)
you're still saying to people if you are (44:22 - 44:26)
unable to go outside and walk we are (44:24 - 44:27)
heading into (44:26 - 44:29)
winter or you're unable to go outside (44:27 - 44:31)
and walk for (44:29 - 44:34)
many many reasons you you don't get any (44:31 - 44:36)
benefit from you don't get the extra (44:34 - 44:36)
benefit (44:36 - 44:39)
from this it is a weirdly ableist (44:36 - 44:43)
stance and it's coming at an incredibly (44:39 - 44:45)
weird time and it's definitely something (44:43 - 44:47)
they did not need to do (44:45 - 44:49)
they really could have left it i mean i (44:47 - 44:50)
think it would have almost (44:49 - 44:52)
been better to say incense duration (44:50 - 44:55)
drops back to 30 minutes (44:52 - 44:57)
but effectiveness is still there like (44:55 - 44:59)
that would have probably been (44:57 - 45:01)
i would have like i like the 60 minutes (44:59 - 45:02)
way more than 30. (45:01 - 45:05)
yeah but 60 minutes 30 minutes affects (45:02 - 45:07)
everybody equally (45:05 - 45:10)
this one doesn't and that's a problem (45:07 - 45:11)
like i would i would take (45:10 - 45:14)
60 minutes 90 second spawns over 30 (45:11 - 45:15)
minutes (45:14 - 45:16)
one minute spawns and the reason i would (45:15 - 45:18)
say that is because i thought that one (45:16 - 45:19)
minute was (45:18 - 45:22)
very fast and i couldn't multitask (45:19 - 45:24)
like i just felt like if i if i left the (45:22 - 45:25)
app for a little bit (45:24 - 45:28)
to check twitter or to respond to a text (45:25 - 45:30)
i was missing a spawn (45:28 - 45:32)
and then i felt like i was wasting my 80 (45:30 - 45:36)
cents oh your 80 cents was wasted but (45:32 - 45:38)
so don't don't worry about how you feel (45:36 - 45:40)
about that because i did i did a lot of (45:38 - 45:43)
um at home streams with that's a very (45:40 - 45:45)
perceived problem that's that is your (45:43 - 45:46)
perception because you (45:45 - 45:50)
are multitasking yeah yeah that is your (45:46 - 45:51)
experience because you want to do other (45:50 - 45:52)
things (45:51 - 45:55)
so you want the cushion of 30 minutes (45:52 - 45:57)
that doesn't affect (45:55 - 45:58)
how other people interact with this game (45:57 - 46:00)
or make that better (45:58 - 46:04)
this this having to get a better spawn (46:00 - 46:06)
rate while walking (46:04 - 46:08)
does affect people very unequally (46:06 - 46:10)
whether you perceive it or not (46:08 - 46:13)
the reality is if you cannot walk (46:10 - 46:16)
you are going to be punished well yeah (46:13 - 46:17)
if you're a mobility impaired (46:16 - 46:19)
yes are we if you can't walk you can't (46:17 - 46:21)
go outside you can't do something (46:19 - 46:23)
you're still trying to be safe in a (46:21 - 46:26)
global pandemic that's an uptick (46:23 - 46:29)
all of these things are punishing those (46:26 - 46:30)
people (46:29 - 46:32)
in a way that it doesn't punish equally (46:30 - 46:34)
i mean that's that's a fundamental (46:32 - 46:35)
problem with the game from the beginning (46:34 - 46:36)
right oh yeah (46:35 - 46:38)
yeah that's that's not new i mean it's (46:36 - 46:40)
not new but they didn't have to make it (46:38 - 46:42)
worse is all i'm saying yeah it's like (46:40 - 46:44)
it's like yeah they instead of saying (46:42 - 46:46)
hey by making this change we actually (46:44 - 46:47)
had a greater benefit than we had (46:46 - 46:48)
expected (46:47 - 46:50)
let's keep this change they're saying (46:48 - 46:51)
we're just gonna ignore that greater (46:50 - 46:53)
benefit because you know (46:51 - 46:55)
shareholders i don't think it's that bad (46:53 - 46:56)
though i don't think (46:55 - 46:59)
from 60 seconds to 90 seconds is the end (46:56 - 47:00)
of the world (46:59 - 47:01)
i think it's not the i think they just (47:00 - 47:04)
should have communicated that (47:01 - 47:07)
it's not the end of the world to you i (47:04 - 47:10)
i i don't i do not think that change (47:07 - 47:10)
alone (47:10 - 47:12)
ruins the game you are getting maybe (47:10 - 47:13)
maybe (47:12 - 47:15)
i can't do the math real quick you're (47:13 - 47:17)
getting what five less pokemon an hour (47:15 - 47:18)
but you're still getting (47:17 - 47:21)
30 plus pokemon in an hour as opposed to (47:18 - 47:23)
the (47:21 - 47:26)
six pokemon you would have gotten on the (47:23 - 47:27)
incense that we had for (47:26 - 47:30)
three years and that was it and if you (47:27 - 47:32)
were moving you would only got (47:30 - 47:34)
10. so what they're saying now is if (47:32 - 47:36)
you're not moving (47:34 - 47:38)
you would have gotten like 40 and now if (47:36 - 47:41)
you are not moving you get like 36. (47:38 - 47:45)
the past being bad and then being fixed (47:41 - 47:48)
and it isn't a great example to say hey (47:45 - 47:49)
it was really bad before and they fixed (47:48 - 47:50)
it (47:49 - 47:52)
so now it's less bad isn't a great (47:50 - 47:53)
argument (47:52 - 47:55)
but to say like oh we're getting four (47:53 - 47:57)
less pokemon this is awful is like (47:55 - 48:00)
that's that's really like i i don't know (47:57 - 48:01)
i'm not a pokemon accountant (48:00 - 48:03)
[Laughter] (48:01 - 48:05)
i'm i'm not i'm not looking like i would (48:03 - 48:07)
assume that most people listening to the (48:05 - 48:08)
show didn't (48:07 - 48:09)
just assumed it went back to normal once (48:08 - 48:11)
every five minutes but it went from 60 (48:09 - 48:13)
seconds to 90 seconds which was not (48:11 - 48:14)
communicated which was why people were (48:13 - 48:15)
upset they thought that like (48:14 - 48:17)
oh now what's the point of even using (48:15 - 48:20)
incense these two companies are so bad (48:17 - 48:21)
at communicating things if they would (48:20 - 48:23)
have just said hey that right (48:21 - 48:26)
instead of instead of every six um you (48:23 - 48:27)
know 60 seconds we're changing it to (48:26 - 48:29)
every 90 seconds i think most people (48:27 - 48:30)
would be like (48:29 - 48:33)
yeah uh okay fine and if you're moving (48:30 - 48:34)
you're going to get more pokemon which i (48:33 - 48:36)
don't know i wish i did (48:34 - 48:38)
i don't know with the old incense i (48:36 - 48:40)
don't think it mattered if you were (48:38 - 48:42)
moving or not (48:40 - 48:43)
because i did i think you were just (48:42 - 48:45)
getting one every minute i don't think (48:43 - 48:46)
you could make one (48:45 - 48:47)
i don't well if you could make them (48:46 - 48:49)
spawn in like 45 seconds i don't think (48:47 - 48:50)
you could (48:49 - 48:51)
unless you were fast catching i don't (48:50 - 48:53)
think you could catch (48:51 - 48:56)
non-stop but the timing on this is bad (48:53 - 48:56)
i'm not saying (48:56 - 48:58)
the timing is bad the communication is (48:56 - 49:01)
bad the decision is a little (48:58 - 49:02)
questionable (49:01 - 49:05)
i i think if this if this was if this (49:02 - 49:06)
was not (49:05 - 49:09)
both of these so hatch egg distance will (49:06 - 49:10)
return to normal (49:09 - 49:13)
like i don't find the only people (49:10 - 49:14)
complaining would probably be the people (49:13 - 49:16)
who (49:14 - 49:18)
buy 10 incubators a week and put their (49:16 - 49:20)
phone in a sock and spin their sock in a (49:18 - 49:22)
circle to hatch (49:20 - 49:23)
i thought you had a spring i didn't do (49:22 - 49:26)
it in a pringles tube i thought that was (49:23 - 49:26)
the best way (49:26 - 49:29)
but you go a hatch distance returns to (49:26 - 49:30)
normal (49:29 - 49:32)
oh guess well guess what's this week an (49:30 - 49:34)
egg event (49:32 - 49:36)
huh the timing of that and then you go (49:34 - 49:37)
the (49:36 - 49:39)
increased effectiveness will only apply (49:37 - 49:41)
to walking okay well (49:39 - 49:42)
everyone's mad because you didn't (49:41 - 49:44)
actually say what you're doing (49:42 - 49:45)
and if you would have said what you were (49:44 - 49:47)
doing people probably would have been (49:45 - 49:48)
like okay (49:47 - 49:50)
i gotta wait an extra 30 seconds that's (49:48 - 49:51)
not the end of the world (49:50 - 49:54)
it still lasts an hour but they probably (49:51 - 49:56)
could have just waited till (49:54 - 49:58)
july january 1st they should have waited (49:56 - 49:59)
until january first because (49:58 - 50:01)
even though we all know deep down the (49:59 - 50:02)
pandemic isn't going (50:01 - 50:04)
anywhere january 1st everyone has this (50:02 - 50:06)
like (50:04 - 50:08)
thought process of new year a new year (50:06 - 50:11)
niantic really just (50:08 - 50:13)
they need more people on these decisions (50:11 - 50:14)
and how to communicate (50:13 - 50:18)
like they just they just need to sit (50:14 - 50:20)
down and be like okay (50:18 - 50:22)
let's let's think about how we message (50:20 - 50:23)
this (50:22 - 50:25)
because they are so weirdly secretive (50:23 - 50:27)
about the dumbest things (50:25 - 50:30)
and it just serves to make people mad (50:27 - 50:32)
ingress had the same rollout (50:30 - 50:34)
actually i wasn't sure if this was like (50:32 - 50:36)
the pokemon company forcing niantic's (50:34 - 50:37)
hand here (50:36 - 50:39)
ingress has the same role that roll out (50:37 - 50:41)
on things ironically (50:39 - 50:44)
harry potter wizards unite still has all (50:41 - 50:45)
their safety features they did not roll (50:44 - 50:47)
back any of them (50:45 - 50:50)
so it seems that warner brothers (50:47 - 50:53)
said no the only reason i bring that up (50:50 - 50:54)
is because people are very (50:53 - 50:58)
quick to blame niantic but why didn't (50:54 - 51:00)
the pokemon company step in if they also (50:58 - 51:01)

flamethrower i guess (56:45 - 56:49)

morning crown tundra trainers can (59:39 - 59:43)
explore a vast (59:42 - 59:46)
frigid landscape unova confirmed with (59:43 - 59:46)
jagged (59:46 - 59:48)
snowy mountains and drifts of glittering (59:46 - 59:50)
snow and the (59:48 - 59:52)
expansion pass is available for the (59:50 - 59:53)
eshop (59:52 - 59:55)
trainers will have the opportu and (59:53 - 59:56)
starting on november 6 (59:55 - 59:58)
trainers will have the opportunity to (59:56 - 60:00)
purchase bundle packs consisting of the (59:58 - 60:03)
pokemon sword and shield base games (60:00 - 60:06)
as well as the corresponding expansion (60:03 - 60:06)
pass (60:06 - 60:08)
which includes both the isle of armor (60:06 - 60:10)
and the crown tundra (60:08 - 60:12)
these bundles are well suited for (60:10 - 60:14)
trainers who have yet to embark on their (60:12 - 60:15)
journey (60:14 - 60:17)
this was kind of obvious we've talked (60:15 - 60:18)
about this for months (60:17 - 60:20)
that there's no way they're not putting (60:18 - 60:23)
out an updated version on shelves before (60:20 - 60:24)
the holiday (60:23 - 60:27)
yep yeah true yeah absolutely (60:24 - 60:30)
that was a given i'd be curious if like (60:27 - 60:33)
target walmart pulls the old copies (60:30 - 60:35)
at this point i don't know i mean they (60:33 - 60:36)
probably have both (60:35 - 60:40)
because i mean i don't i don't know (60:36 - 60:42)
is it a different price like is it oh (60:40 - 60:43)
yeah they did not show (60:42 - 60:45)
they didn't they didn't show price so we (60:43 - 60:47)
don't know like i'm assuming it won't be (60:45 - 60:48)
60 bucks (60:47 - 60:51)
i mean ideally it would be 90 but if (60:48 - 60:53)
they're putting it on shelves (60:51 - 60:57)
at 90 that seems really high so usually (60:53 - 60:58)
i don't know i could see them pricing it (60:57 - 61:00)
at 80 but that still seems a lot (60:58 - 61:03)
i mean if they put it at 60 that that (61:00 - 61:04)
that'd be a (61:03 - 61:06)
heck of a steal for people who have not (61:04 - 61:08)
played yet (61:06 - 61:12)
that would probably move a lot more than (61:08 - 61:12)
during the video presentation ishihara (61:12 - 61:18)
president and ceo of the pokemon company (61:16 - 61:18)
also (61:18 - 61:21)
unveiled a newly discovered pokemon (61:18 - 61:24)
new games and exciting in-game bonuses (61:21 - 61:25)
for sword and shield (61:24 - 61:28)
uh or the expansion pack as well as the (61:25 - 61:29)
updates to go we already talked about (61:28 - 61:30)
that (61:29 - 61:32)
so the newly discovered pokemon there's (61:30 - 61:33)
two of them (61:32 - 61:37)
one is galerion slow king uh (61:33 - 61:38)
which is the poison psychic type pokemon (61:37 - 61:41)
with the ability curious medicine (61:38 - 61:44)
a shelter bite set off a reaction (61:41 - 61:46)
between chemicals (61:44 - 61:49)
uh by galore glaring slow king's brain (61:46 - 61:52)
and the species in spices inside its (61:49 - 61:52)
body (61:52 - 61:55)
causing slow poke to gain poison type (61:52 - 61:56)
when (61:55 - 61:58)
evolved into slu gallerian sloking (61:56 - 62:00)
sloking has been observed (61:58 - 62:02)
uh uttering incarnations in order to (62:00 - 62:04)
communicate with others (62:02 - 62:06)
and appears to change incantations (62:04 - 62:08)
indentations (62:06 - 62:10)
and appears to chant mysterious spells (62:08 - 62:11)
while mu (62:10 - 62:13)
while using moves in battle valerian (62:11 - 62:14)
slow king's ability (62:13 - 62:17)
curious medicine is a new ability (62:14 - 62:18)
introduced in the crown tundra (62:17 - 62:21)
the other new pokemon is gigantomax mel (62:18 - 62:22)
metal (62:21 - 62:24)
while gigantomax the mythical pokemon (62:22 - 62:26)
mel metal can use its flexible (62:24 - 62:29)
elastic liquid metal body to land (62:26 - 62:31)
punches even when the opponent (62:29 - 62:33)
keeps their distance steel type attacks (62:31 - 62:35)
used by gigantomax male metal will (62:33 - 62:36)
change into g (62:35 - 62:39)
max melton a powerful move that slams (62:36 - 62:41)
the opponent with shock waves and (62:39 - 62:42)
swirling liquid metal (62:41 - 62:44)
this move not only deals damage to (62:42 - 62:46)
opponent it prevents them from using the (62:44 - 62:46)
same (62:46 - 62:49)
moves consecutively that actually seems (62:46 - 62:52)
like a pretty good gmax move (62:49 - 62:54)
yeah especially if somebody's using like (62:52 - 62:56)
a focus sash (62:54 - 62:57)
so what is that one called torment is (62:56 - 62:59)
the torment that stops you from being (62:57 - 63:00)
able to yeah (62:59 - 63:03)
torment i think yeah so it's it's (63:00 - 63:03)
torment (63:03 - 63:08)
and well torment that does damage (63:03 - 63:10)
torment on a stick curious medicine the (63:08 - 63:12)
ability for slow king (63:10 - 63:16)
it removes um (63:12 - 63:18)
it normalizes your stat changes so if (63:16 - 63:20)
you were like negative to (63:18 - 63:21)
attack because of intimidate when (63:20 - 63:23)
galerian slow king comes out (63:21 - 63:26)
it will change that back to normal only (63:23 - 63:28)
affects you and your partner (63:26 - 63:30)
does not affect your opponents but i (63:28 - 63:32)
mean if you (63:30 - 63:35)
but it also affected if you had built it (63:32 - 63:35)
up right (63:35 - 63:39)
like it resets yeah it resets everything (63:35 - 63:41)
yeah so it resets an ally stat changes (63:39 - 63:42)
so if you got (63:41 - 63:47)
a defiant boost or whatever it go away (63:42 - 63:48)
from my understanding yeah (63:47 - 63:50)
[Music] (63:48 - 63:52)
i think hilarion slow king is not going (63:50 - 63:55)
to be good and competitive but (63:52 - 63:58)
who am i somebody time date stamp that (63:55 - 64:00)
well it's okay so it's signature move i (63:58 - 64:01)
don't remember what it's called (64:00 - 64:05)
yeah eerie spell it it removes the pp (64:01 - 64:08)
minus three depending on the last (64:05 - 64:08)
pokemon (64:08 - 64:10)
like depending on the pokemon's last (64:08 - 64:12)
move so for example (64:10 - 64:14)
if you were fighting a premarina that's (64:12 - 64:16)
going to hydro pump (64:14 - 64:18)
and they pped up their hydro pump they (64:16 - 64:20)
would have eight (64:18 - 64:21)
so it would bring it down to they use (64:20 - 64:23)
the hydro pump they're down to seven (64:21 - 64:26)
you use mysterious spell (64:23 - 64:28)
eerie spell eerie spell and then it (64:26 - 64:30)
brings it down to math time (64:28 - 64:33)
four so they can still use hydro pump (64:30 - 64:34)
again (64:33 - 64:38)
but one that's assuming you survive (64:34 - 64:38)
two that's assuming that (64:39 - 64:44)
they planned on using the move you (64:42 - 64:46)
planned on removing the pp (64:44 - 64:50)
and three what if you just knocked them (64:46 - 64:52)
out instead of worrying about how much (64:50 - 64:53)
pp they had (64:52 - 64:55)
i mean but this also works on things (64:53 - 64:58)
like sucker punch right (64:55 - 65:00)
yeah yeah yeah i mean it would work on (64:58 - 65:02)
any move and i think it depends on (65:00 - 65:06)
on how beefy slow king (65:02 - 65:09)
clarence hulking actually is right yeah (65:06 - 65:11)
if it's if it's a defensive tank because (65:09 - 65:14)
slow king already has (65:11 - 65:15)
regular looking has pretty good defenses (65:14 - 65:17)
doesn't it (65:15 - 65:19)
i don't know the status distribution (65:17 - 65:22)
between a slow king and a slow bro but (65:19 - 65:23)
slow bro (65:22 - 65:26)
isn't that beefy i know that for sure uh (65:23 - 65:30)
slow king's base stats uh defense is bad (65:26 - 65:32)
but special defense is 110. (65:30 - 65:33)
that's good that's a good number pretty (65:32 - 65:35)
good so i mean it (65:33 - 65:38)
it depends on what they are going to do (65:35 - 65:39)
with it (65:38 - 65:43)
but i could see that being a a way of (65:39 - 65:45)
getting rid of some of those moves or (65:43 - 65:47)
like if somebody sets up trick room (65:45 - 65:49)
right does trickroom doesn't have a lot (65:47 - 65:50)
of room is eight (65:49 - 65:53)
as well yeah i mean you're eating away (65:50 - 65:54)
at those i don't (65:53 - 65:56)
think i've ever i've groomed more than (65:54 - 65:58)
twice though which is yeah i've never (65:56 - 65:59)
seen a competition (65:58 - 66:03)
that's been won by eating up somebody's (65:59 - 66:03)
pp (66:03 - 66:05)
it's just no i think the other that (66:03 - 66:07)
doesn't happen until now (66:05 - 66:09)
the other thing too is like i believe (66:07 - 66:12)
eerie spell is a psychic type move (66:09 - 66:14)
yeah but if if if indeed he's coming (66:12 - 66:15)
back or (66:14 - 66:18)
uh tapu lele is coming (66:15 - 66:20)
because they're lifting the band on the (66:18 - 66:22)
16 pokemon when series (66:20 - 66:24)
seven starts you're you have easy ways (66:22 - 66:26)
to set up psychic terrain (66:24 - 66:28)
and i doubt that eerie spell is going to (66:26 - 66:32)
do 110 damage and why would you just not (66:28 - 66:33)
use (66:32 - 66:34)
expanding force expanding force hits (66:33 - 66:37)
both pokemon it does 110 damage (66:34 - 66:40)
it gets the 20 boost in psychic terrain (66:37 - 66:44)
so again who cares how much pp they have (66:40 - 66:45)
if they're dead (66:44 - 66:48)
yep slow bro has those stats the defense (66:45 - 66:50)
and special defense swapped (66:48 - 66:53)
so slow bro's defense is 110 oh okay (66:50 - 66:54)
that says 80. (66:53 - 66:56)
so they're swapped between slow bones (66:54 - 66:57)
looking good to know (66:56 - 66:59)
so the question is is that is that (66:57 - 67:01)
similar swap going to happen (66:59 - 67:05)
in sulking so (67:01 - 67:07)
if they swapped attack and special (67:05 - 67:08)
attack (67:07 - 67:11)
what is glieran's what is glare and (67:08 - 67:12)
sloking stats (67:11 - 67:16)
i mean bros stats do we know um slo-bro (67:12 - 67:17)
has a high (67:16 - 67:19)
special attack i know that for sure (67:17 - 67:20)
because i used one (67:19 - 67:22)
so is it possible that they would swap (67:20 - 67:23)
them (67:22 - 67:27)
that way king has a physical attack (67:23 - 67:29)
well okay glaring slow bro attack is 100 (67:27 - 67:30)
and special (67:29 - 67:33)
attack it's 100 so yeah i wanted to say (67:30 - 67:35)
they they're normally mixed attackers (67:33 - 67:38)
curious gallerian slow bro (67:35 - 67:41)
is it's the same stats as cantonian (67:38 - 67:43)
slo-bro so i'd be curious what they're (67:41 - 67:44)
gonna do (67:43 - 67:48)
i i have a real question about glarion (67:44 - 67:49)
slow king which is pretty much (67:48 - 67:52)
occupied my mind since the moment i saw (67:49 - 67:53)
its (67:52 - 67:57)
actual it's its image does it (67:53 - 68:00)
see through the (67:57 - 68:03)
the shelter's eyes the shelter is in (68:00 - 68:04)
control (68:03 - 68:08)
clearly are you sure (68:04 - 68:11)
i'm just yeah the shelter is (68:08 - 68:14)
in control you can see the the uh (68:11 - 68:15)
slowpoke eyes are (68:14 - 68:19)
are in there you can see them under the (68:15 - 68:20)
crown (68:19 - 68:23)
thing so (68:20 - 68:26)
i was um i don't know this is a luke (68:23 - 68:28)
skywalker on the million falcon thing (68:26 - 68:29)
it's trusting (68:28 - 68:32)
it's trusting his partner to be its eyes (68:29 - 68:33)
it also pours goop out of its (68:32 - 68:36)
shell holes so does it really (68:33 - 68:40)
i didn't notice (68:36 - 68:40)
here i'm sending you the link where the (68:41 - 68:45)
picture is in (68:43 - 68:47)
dynamics adventures players will team up (68:45 - 68:49)
with three other trainers and explore (68:47 - 68:52)
pokemon den or dynamaxx pokemon are said (68:49 - 68:53)
to lurk (68:52 - 68:55)
instead of the regular pokemon team (68:53 - 68:56)
players and their fellow trainers can (68:55 - 68:58)
choose pokemon that they will (68:56 - 69:00)
temporarily use for battle (68:58 - 69:01)
rental pokemon they must have been (69:00 - 69:03)
listening to the go fans (69:01 - 69:08)
and how much they love to run (69:03 - 69:08)
players will have to work together with (69:17 - 69:21)
their three teammates in a max raid (69:19 - 69:21)
battle (69:21 - 69:24)
whenever they encounter a wild dynamax (69:21 - 69:26)
during their exploration (69:24 - 69:27)
if they win the battle players will then (69:26 - 69:28)
have the opportunity to catch the (69:27 - 69:29)
pokemon (69:28 - 69:31)
and one of the trainers can swap their (69:29 - 69:33)
newly caught pokemon for the pokemon (69:31 - 69:35)
they've had before trainers will (69:33 - 69:37)
dwelve deeper in the den with endless (69:35 - 69:38)
dynamaxx (69:37 - 69:40)
adventures which enables players to play (69:38 - 69:43)
until they lose a battle (69:40 - 69:44)
okay so this is one of the big features (69:43 - 69:46)
here this is the (69:44 - 69:49)
uh team up with three people go into a (69:46 - 69:50)
den (69:49 - 69:51)
at the end there's supposed to be a (69:50 - 69:53)
legendary pokemon (69:51 - 69:56)
yep still a lot of questions not (69:53 - 69:57)
answered here (69:56 - 69:59)
number one do you only get to catch one (69:57 - 70:01)
legendary pokemon (69:59 - 70:03)
number two does everyone get to catch (70:01 - 70:04)
the legendary pokemon or is it just the (70:03 - 70:05)
host (70:04 - 70:08)
number three i think the rental thing is (70:05 - 70:09)
actually (70:08 - 70:10)
fine because it prevents people from (70:09 - 70:12)
just doing like greg brings (70:10 - 70:14)
eternius i bring eternity will brings (70:12 - 70:18)
eternities and the last person brings (70:14 - 70:20)
mewtwo wait explain the rental thing to (70:18 - 70:21)
me (70:20 - 70:24)
again um so when you go into it you will (70:21 - 70:25)
get presented i think with four (70:24 - 70:27)
different pokemon (70:25 - 70:28)
yep and you'll see all their moves (70:27 - 70:29)
you'll see their held items and then you (70:28 - 70:30)
pick (70:29 - 70:32)
and everyone picks a rental and then (70:30 - 70:34)
when you battle the first dynamax (70:32 - 70:36)
pokemon then one of the four (70:34 - 70:37)
people participating can take the one (70:36 - 70:39)
they just caught and then swap it out (70:37 - 70:40)
with the rental (70:39 - 70:43)
yeah well swap it for the rental that (70:40 - 70:45)
they started with so i cannot bring my (70:43 - 70:46)
own pokemon no (70:45 - 70:50)
no you may not this sounds like (70:46 - 70:53)
the pokemon mystery dungeon people (70:50 - 70:54)
[Laughter] (70:53 - 70:57)
snuck in at night like let's not kid (70:54 - 70:59)
ourselves when it comes to (70:57 - 71:01)
current dynamics battles you pick the (70:59 - 71:03)
poke you're like i'm fighting rhyperior (71:01 - 71:05)
i'm going to bring a water pokemon (71:03 - 71:08)
you're not you're just spamming the same (71:05 - 71:08)
move (71:08 - 71:11)
there's no there's not like there's the (71:08 - 71:12)
only (71:11 - 71:14)
maybe exception to that was uh the like (71:12 - 71:16)
the only exceptions are like maybe (71:14 - 71:18)
clefable and like the mewtwo stuff (71:16 - 71:19)
like clefable the only difference is you (71:18 - 71:21)
start off using taunt (71:19 - 71:24)
uh so it doesn't minimize but it's not (71:21 - 71:25)
like (71:24 - 71:27)
what we've had for the last year has (71:25 - 71:28)
been incredibly (71:27 - 71:31)
difficult because hey if it's a rock (71:28 - 71:33)
type pokemon (71:31 - 71:36)
i know what it's weak against true (71:33 - 71:39)
yeah i mean it's interesting that like (71:36 - 71:41)
in the pictures you see that there are (71:39 - 71:42)
paths (71:41 - 71:45)
and like you can go down the path where (71:42 - 71:46)
it looks like you get a doctor (71:45 - 71:48)
you go down the path where it looks like (71:46 - 71:50)
you get berries and like you get to (71:48 - 71:51)
choose (71:50 - 71:53)
which path you want to go to and it does (71:51 - 71:55)
list hey (71:53 - 71:56)
if you go down this path with this (71:55 - 71:59)
doctor you'll be fighting a fairy type (71:56 - 72:02)
so it does seem at least there is some (71:59 - 72:06)
level of strategy what i'm curious is (72:02 - 72:09)
if these dens will show you the (72:06 - 72:11)
legendary that you can get at the end (72:09 - 72:13)
and that's (72:11 - 72:15)
like how you choose to go in but like (72:13 - 72:17)
this branching pathing is pretty (72:15 - 72:20)
great you know better than that what's (72:17 - 72:21)
gonna happen (72:20 - 72:24)
is it's going to be like you don't know (72:21 - 72:26)
it's a mystery what pokemon's gonna be (72:24 - 72:28)
at the end of the day and then like (72:26 - 72:31)
a day later somebody's gonna be like i (72:28 - 72:32)
data mined it and (72:31 - 72:35)
if you're entering the den and there's a (72:32 - 72:37)
gold rock in the upper right hand corner (72:35 - 72:39)
it's going to be one of these four (72:37 - 72:42)
pokemon if there's a silver berry in the (72:39 - 72:44)
lower left-hand corner it's going to be (72:42 - 72:45)
one of these four (72:44 - 72:48)
i'm like oh already already i'm (72:45 - 72:50)
disgusted with things that haven't even (72:48 - 72:51)
happened (72:50 - 72:54)
you are just making things up the data (72:51 - 72:54)
miners (72:54 - 72:57)
just live to they do to remove the joy (72:54 - 73:01)
from playing these games all together (72:57 - 73:03)
do we think that all of the denzen crown (73:01 - 73:06)
tundra will be these exploration dens (73:03 - 73:08)
gosh do you think there'll be some (73:06 - 73:10)
regular ones (73:08 - 73:13)
i thought i saw the um like the little (73:10 - 73:17)
purple light dealies in (73:13 - 73:20)
in the ground yeah they have (73:17 - 73:22)
through the crown tundra what greg is (73:20 - 73:24)
asking are all the dens in the crown (73:22 - 73:24)
tundra this (73:24 - 73:28)
the new dens right so like if i wanted (73:24 - 73:28)
to do (73:28 - 73:31)
old dens i have to go back to isle of (73:28 - 73:32)
arms (73:31 - 73:35)
yeah i would find that hard to believe i (73:32 - 73:36)
i would want (73:35 - 73:38)
the new style dens that let you go (73:36 - 73:40)
deeper as they say (73:38 - 73:43)
to look different yeah i would agree (73:40 - 73:44)
with you (73:43 - 73:46)
because i don't know if i want to do new (73:44 - 73:49)
style dens with computers (73:46 - 73:52)
yeah and but then also it's like if i'm (73:49 - 73:54)
on the isle of armor like if i learn how (73:52 - 73:54)
to (73:54 - 73:56)
go deeper into the dens in the crown (73:54 - 73:59)
tundra why can't i then when i go to the (73:56 - 74:00)
isle of armor do it there (73:59 - 74:02)
why when i go to the wild area why can't (74:00 - 74:04)
i do it there uh their copy and paste (74:02 - 74:06)
broke (74:04 - 74:09)
yep this screenshot (74:06 - 74:11)
of like a trainer standing in the path (74:09 - 74:13)
and the arrow and the berries (74:11 - 74:16)
it looks bad why it just (74:13 - 74:20)
this overview it it just doesn't (74:16 - 74:22)
look good it just looks very it looks (74:20 - 74:24)
artificial it looks fake (74:22 - 74:28)
it looks like a flash game what like the (74:24 - 74:31)
like the trainer like it's a very flat (74:28 - 74:33)
surface right like the background is (74:31 - 74:35)
flat and then the pokemon silhouettes (74:33 - 74:38)
are flat and then the trainer has like (74:35 - 74:41)
slight 3d to it wait are you looking at (74:38 - 74:43)
like the overhead of the map (74:41 - 74:46)
yeah where it says fire fairy bug (74:43 - 74:47)
psychic rock and then there's berries (74:46 - 74:49)
this is the screenshot i'm looking at (74:47 - 74:53)
yeah i'm looking at the same one bad (74:49 - 74:55)
yeah but a lot looked bad before it was (74:53 - 74:57)
actually moving (74:55 - 74:59)
yeah maybe yeah it may be a movement it (74:57 - 75:00)
looks better i mean (74:59 - 75:01)
there could be a whole bunch of things (75:00 - 75:03)
going on here that's in this (75:01 - 75:05)
screenshot that i mean this is just a (75:03 - 75:07)
still screenshot (75:05 - 75:10)
well but also my previous statement (75:07 - 75:14)
again it's just pokemon mystery dungeon (75:10 - 75:15)
and that that game didn't have that (75:14 - 75:18)
great graphics so (75:15 - 75:20)
that's what you're gonna get all hate (75:18 - 75:21)
mail can go to (75:20 - 75:23)
will anderson oh the hate mail is going (75:21 - 75:25)
to come from one person (75:23 - 75:27)
and once i delete snapchat they won't (75:25 - 75:30)
have any way to communicate with me so (75:27 - 75:33)
uh i'm you know i'm i'm (75:30 - 75:35)
excited i hope it's good i i still have (75:33 - 75:36)
all these questions about the legends (75:35 - 75:37)
and (75:36 - 75:40)
yeah and whatnot like i mean i'm i (75:37 - 75:42)
am looking forward to being able to do (75:40 - 75:43)
like four people getting together (75:42 - 75:47)
doing this whole like hey let's rent (75:43 - 75:48)
these pokemon and do this thing (75:47 - 75:50)
like the endless dynamic adventure (75:48 - 75:52)
sounds like a good monday night (75:50 - 75:55)
raid night there is an endless mode (75:52 - 75:55)
where (75:55 - 75:58)
you can just keep going i think this has (75:55 - 75:59)
already existed (75:58 - 76:02)
but in the dojo where you can (75:59 - 76:06)
you can keep going for whatever (76:02 - 76:09)
mustards uh restrictive sparring i think (76:06 - 76:10)
it's called (76:09 - 76:11)
yup i don't know you've been doing it (76:10 - 76:14)
for a week i know but there's no (76:11 - 76:16)
there's no reason there's no reason to (76:14 - 76:17)
why (76:16 - 76:20)
like yeah you can get i mean for (76:17 - 76:21)
bragging rights i guess you could be (76:20 - 76:23)
like i went to 15 (76:21 - 76:24)
and then you know what what's gonna (76:23 - 76:26)
happen this is what's gonna happen it's (76:24 - 76:27)
like you go to five for (76:26 - 76:28)
so if you don't know what restrictive (76:27 - 76:31)
sparring in in the isle of armor (76:28 - 76:34)
what it does is you pick (76:31 - 76:36)
you pick which type you want so let's (76:34 - 76:37)
say you want um (76:36 - 76:40)
water and you have to bring three water (76:37 - 76:41)
pokemon (76:40 - 76:43)
and then you have to do five battles in (76:41 - 76:45)
a row you can heal (76:43 - 76:48)
twice up to two times (76:45 - 76:50)
during these battles and then you ha you (76:48 - 76:52)
have to win five and you have to do that (76:50 - 76:54)
for all 18 types and if you were to do (76:52 - 76:56)
that for all 18 types you get an (76:54 - 76:57)
exclusive shirt (76:56 - 76:59)
which is what the diglett thing should (76:57 - 77:00)
have gave you she gave you a shirt that (76:59 - 77:01)
said i (77:00 - 77:03)
i did the diglett thing that's what the (77:01 - 77:04)
shirt should have said i did the diglett (77:03 - 77:05)
thing (77:04 - 77:07)
so here's the most important question is (77:05 - 77:09)
the shirt worth it (77:07 - 77:11)
to me no i think it's an ugly shirt i (77:09 - 77:13)
just want the shirt to show that i did (77:11 - 77:14)
it and i have the shirt (77:13 - 77:18)
i was here on this date of the concert (77:14 - 77:19)
when they were in milwaukee i just want (77:18 - 77:22)
the shirt to show that i did it so (77:19 - 77:25)
18 types five battles each what is the (77:22 - 77:27)
math on that that's like 70-some battles (77:25 - 77:27)
right (77:27 - 77:30)
it's a lot of battles and so if in (77:27 - 77:32)
restrictive sparring (77:30 - 77:35)
if you get paralyzed but you still have (77:32 - 77:36)
full health you go into the next match (77:35 - 77:38)
being paralyzed and you only have two (77:36 - 77:39)
revives (77:38 - 77:42)
and the computer can use whatever they (77:39 - 77:43)
want (77:42 - 77:45)
so if they're p if you're doing three (77:43 - 77:47)
water pokemon because that's (77:45 - 77:49)
you're doing the water challenge guess (77:47 - 77:50)
what they're bringing electric they're (77:49 - 77:52)
bringing grass they're bringing things (77:50 - 77:52)
weak to (77:52 - 77:54)
super effective to you so it kind of (77:52 - 77:56)
makes you feel like the gym leader (77:54 - 77:59)
and i would argue that if you're not ev (77:56 - 78:01)
trained (77:59 - 78:03)
and you don't put held items on it's (78:01 - 78:04)
actually pretty hard (78:03 - 78:06)
but there is an endless mode there once (78:04 - 78:08)
you get to five it'll say do you want to (78:06 - 78:09)
keep going (78:08 - 78:12)
and i guess you can say yes and you can (78:09 - 78:13)
maybe go to like 10 or 15 but you know (78:12 - 78:14)
what's gonna happen (78:13 - 78:17)
you're gonna be like hey i got to 15 and (78:14 - 78:19)
restrictive sparring the other night and (78:17 - 78:20)
your friend is gonna go (78:19 - 78:23)
i've never done that what is it because (78:20 - 78:24)
i feel like basically (78:23 - 78:26)
no one has ever talked about restrictive (78:24 - 78:27)
sparring (78:26 - 78:29)
i mean if you're going to break (78:27 - 78:31)
everything down like that i mean (78:29 - 78:35)
bragging only matters to you (78:31 - 78:37)
and the one person that might know what (78:35 - 78:38)
you're talking about like that is (78:37 - 78:41)
all of shiny hunting oh cool (78:38 - 78:44)
yeah i'm just saying for the endless (78:41 - 78:45)
adventure (78:44 - 78:48)
here yeah but the endless adventure here (78:45 - 78:49)
could be going to (78:48 - 78:52)
find more legendaries in a row and (78:49 - 78:54)
having a chance to catch them (78:52 - 78:56)
right like there could definitely be a (78:54 - 78:57)
reason like (78:56 - 78:58)
i'm going to keep going down here and (78:57 - 79:00)
see what the next legendary are and see (78:58 - 79:01)
how many i bet it does (79:00 - 79:05)
i can catch it in a in a set (79:01 - 79:08)
i bet that there are i bet that (79:05 - 79:10)
you get the legend after five and then (79:08 - 79:12)
anything after that is just (79:10 - 79:14)
normal pokemon because in the in the (79:12 - 79:16)
restrictive sparring you get (79:14 - 79:17)
i think it's 30 battle points when you (79:16 - 79:18)
get to five and then everything after (79:17 - 79:20)
that is just like three battle points (79:18 - 79:22)
three battle points three battle points (79:20 - 79:23)
yeah i'm assuming once you get the (79:22 - 79:25)
legend he asks if you want to leave or (79:23 - 79:27)
if you want to keep going (79:25 - 79:29)
but i guess we don't know but also like (79:27 - 79:30)
what do you get if in restrictive (79:29 - 79:32)
sparring if you're getting battle points (79:30 - 79:33)
what is this giving you (79:32 - 79:36)
um pokemon yeah okay i guess (79:33 - 79:38)
pokemon but like is it giving you like (79:36 - 79:40)
armor right or is it giving you (79:38 - 79:43)
uh experience candy do you want to be (79:40 - 79:45)
with these people even longer (79:43 - 79:47)
do you want to suffer with dean noah and (79:45 - 79:49)
isabelle for more battles (79:47 - 79:51)
i thought i wanted to be with you but (79:49 - 79:52)
apparently it's just will and i and (79:51 - 79:54)
whoever else wants to join because (79:52 - 79:55)
you're (79:54 - 79:57)
a party pooper with the crown tundra (79:55 - 79:59)
trainers will be able to encounter every (79:57 - 80:01)
legendary pokemon that has appeared in (79:59 - 80:02)
the main series video game (80:01 - 80:04)
players can find and catch legendary (80:02 - 80:06)
pokemon during their travels (80:04 - 80:08)
uh in the crown tundra or while on (80:06 - 80:10)
dynamaxx adventure (80:08 - 80:11)
and then just keep in mind some (80:10 - 80:13)
legendaries will only appear in pokemon (80:11 - 80:15)
sword others will only appear in pokemon (80:13 - 80:16)
shield (80:15 - 80:19)
what a rip-off it's almost like they've (80:16 - 80:21)
been doing this for 20 years too (80:19 - 80:24)
they're doing distributions for pikachu (80:21 - 80:26)
uh all these hat pikachu that were in (80:24 - 80:27)
sun and moon and then (80:26 - 80:30)
came back in sun and moon um are they're (80:27 - 80:31)
doing it again (80:30 - 80:32)
so if you're missing out on the hat (80:31 - 80:35)
pikachu uh there's a bunch of those (80:32 - 80:38)
okay quick quick quick quick sidebar (80:35 - 80:38)
question (80:38 - 80:41)
in the legendary list it shows (80:38 - 80:44)
urjifu mm-hmm or she feels legit (80:41 - 80:46)
are we assuming there will be hershey (80:44 - 80:48)
food tens (80:46 - 80:50)
so you can get the other k so you can (80:48 - 80:51)
get the other one (80:50 - 80:54)
so like if you want water you can get (80:51 - 80:55)
the dark one that way (80:54 - 80:56)
yes that's what i'm saying this is (80:55 - 80:58)
important for me to decide what i'm (80:56 - 80:59)
doing with my cub food when i do my (80:58 - 81:01)
sword (80:59 - 81:03)
dlc you keep it up yeah they need to (81:01 - 81:05)
yeah i need to keep that kub foo for my (81:03 - 81:06)
living decks (81:05 - 81:10)
yeah just put it just put everest on it (81:06 - 81:11)
i mean i just get it and don't have to (81:10 - 81:12)
do anything right because if i can get a (81:11 - 81:14)
dark one from these legendary (81:12 - 81:16)
dens you can you can go through the (81:14 - 81:17)
whole tower with an everstone and when (81:16 - 81:18)
you get to the end (81:17 - 81:21)
um mustard will say like oh i see you (81:18 - 81:22)
don't want to evolve your cub food you (81:21 - 81:23)
don't have to but you can complete the (81:22 - 81:25)
dlc without evolving it (81:23 - 81:28)
but why would i want to go through the (81:25 - 81:28)
tower (81:28 - 81:30)
so you don't have that marker on your (81:28 - 81:32)
map all the time would be the only (81:30 - 81:33)
reason (81:32 - 81:37)
i think you get one legend right there's (81:33 - 81:40)
no way they're gonna be like (81:37 - 81:40)
there's no way they're gonna be like you (81:41 - 81:44)
get like three hershey food by just (81:42 - 81:45)
running dens (81:44 - 81:47)
i really bet the host is the only one (81:45 - 81:49)
that can catch the legend (81:47 - 81:54)
no no no no no it's everybody in the (81:49 - 81:57)
in the raid just like raids always are (81:54 - 81:58)
yeah maybe (81:57 - 82:01)
i guess i mean if it's not then (81:58 - 82:04)
that that that exclusivity hurts a lot (82:01 - 82:06)
it's no different than any exclusivity i (82:04 - 82:08)
only get one character when i play (82:06 - 82:09)
sapphire i only want (82:08 - 82:12)
one groudon when i play ruby the only (82:09 - 82:13)
time they threw you (82:12 - 82:15)
the only time they threw you a bone was (82:13 - 82:17)
in uh ultrasound ultra moon where (82:15 - 82:19)
there's like here's two blacephalons and (82:17 - 82:21)
here's two stockatakas (82:19 - 82:24)
yeah but like in this current in the (82:21 - 82:25)
current den thing (82:24 - 82:28)
if a sword person threw up a den you (82:25 - 82:29)
could still catch the one from across (82:28 - 82:30)
the way (82:29 - 82:32)
oh without having to do a trade yeah and (82:30 - 82:34)
that would be a huge change for this one (82:32 - 82:36)
what's stopping like (82:34 - 82:37)
what's stopping the host from just (82:36 - 82:40)
resetting themselves the three partners (82:37 - 82:42)
catch and then they just run it again (82:40 - 82:43)
and they're like all right here you go (82:42 - 82:45)
here's unlimited outselfs (82:43 - 82:47)
nothing but they haven't done that so (82:45 - 82:48)
far (82:47 - 82:50)
they haven't put that limit in on (82:48 - 82:52)
anything that's why if (82:50 - 82:54)
yeah that's why if the limit is only the (82:52 - 82:56)
host can catch then (82:54 - 82:58)
there's no point in the host resetting (82:56 - 82:59)
because they're not they're not (82:58 - 83:00)
resetting for the other three (82:59 - 83:02)
and then there's no point in anybody (83:00 - 83:04)
doing raids with you yeah yeah because (83:02 - 83:06)
i cannot get anything from all this hard (83:04 - 83:08)
work one you're getting the pokemon up (83:06 - 83:10)
to it too do you really want to do it (83:08 - 83:12)
with cpus (83:10 - 83:14)
yeah why not uh it doesn't matter about (83:12 - 83:15)
what i want (83:14 - 83:18)
i i could not want to do it with cpus (83:15 - 83:20)
and still have all my friends (83:18 - 83:21)
not want to do it with me because they (83:20 - 83:23)
don't want to waste their time (83:21 - 83:26)
on getting all those (83:23 - 83:26)
uh zygarde you help me get my zygarde (83:26 - 83:32)
do you think that's how the world works (83:29 - 83:34)
you're imagining things (83:32 - 83:36)
i get my zygarde and i'm like sorry guys (83:34 - 83:38)
i gotta go to bed sorry work early (83:36 - 83:39)
tomorrow (83:38 - 83:40)
as somebody who's done a lot of destiny (83:39 - 83:42)
raids there are a lot of those people (83:40 - 83:45)
yes (83:42 - 83:45)
i mean i just think like that's a big (83:45 - 83:50)
departure from how they've set up (83:48 - 83:53)
all raids going so far i can see them (83:50 - 83:55)
really changing the odds but i don't (83:53 - 83:56)
think they'll just say (83:55 - 83:59)
oh only the host gets it i mean they (83:56 - 84:01)
they let us do mewtwo and say hey you (83:59 - 84:02)
can't catch me too (84:01 - 84:04)
yeah but nobody could but nobody can (84:02 - 84:06)
catch it (84:04 - 84:08)
what if this happens what if no one (84:06 - 84:09)
catches (84:08 - 84:12)
it it then forces the pokemon to spawn (84:09 - 84:14)
in a point in the game where you walk up (84:12 - 84:16)
to it and then you can catch it because (84:14 - 84:16)
again (84:16 - 84:18)
because how are you going to software (84:16 - 84:20)
set for it (84:18 - 84:22)
why do you have to software set for it (84:20 - 84:23)
because (84:22 - 84:26)
people are going okay people already (84:23 - 84:27)
hate sword and shield (84:26 - 84:29)
and now they're going to be like oh you (84:27 - 84:31)
can't get shiny legends (84:29 - 84:32)
you can get shiny legends you just can't (84:31 - 84:34)
soft reset for them (84:32 - 84:36)
okay so even if all your friends are all (84:34 - 84:38)
gonna catch the landorus (84:36 - 84:40)
do you think all your friends want to do (84:38 - 84:43)
this one in four thousand times (84:40 - 84:46)
did the designers of this game (84:43 - 84:50)
are making design choices around (84:46 - 84:54)
anyone's ability to maximize their (84:50 - 84:57)
opportunity to get a shiny pokemon yeah (84:54 - 84:58)
they are sorry (84:57 - 85:00)
they have purposely locked pokemon they (84:58 - 85:02)
know that players do this (85:00 - 85:03)
they are definitely making these (85:02 - 85:05)
decisions (85:03 - 85:07)
well no they make decisions to stop (85:05 - 85:08)
people from getting shiny (85:07 - 85:10)
pokemon if they're making decisions for (85:08 - 85:12)
to stop people from getting shiny (85:10 - 85:13)
pokemon then why would they not make the (85:12 - 85:16)
decision of we don't want you to get (85:13 - 85:19)
200 landorus by just resetting (85:16 - 85:20)
again if the host resets and the other (85:19 - 85:22)
three catch (85:20 - 85:24)
the host does it again and then it's (85:22 - 85:25)
just unlimited landorus (85:24 - 85:27)
well i think we're in a time of (85:25 - 85:28)
unlimited landorus (85:27 - 85:32)
that's a that's a very depressing time (85:28 - 85:33)
i mean they haven't done it for anything (85:32 - 85:36)
else they just haven't (85:33 - 85:37)
we've been dealing with why aren't you (85:36 - 85:39)
getting unlimited gmaxes (85:37 - 85:41)
yeah and they've had a full year to (85:39 - 85:42)
figure this out (85:41 - 85:45)
and they haven't done it this is the (85:42 - 85:46)
update (85:45 - 85:47)
yeah what makes us think they're going (85:46 - 85:49)
to like they haven't even (85:47 - 85:51)
like they have that year they didn't (85:49 - 85:52)
change it with the last stop this is the (85:51 - 85:53)
first time (85:52 - 85:55)
catchable legendaries will be in raids (85:53 - 85:57)
so to say they've never done this (85:55 - 85:58)
yeah i guess but they've never done this (85:57 - 86:00)
for actual legends (85:58 - 86:02)
they gave us two towers for hershey food (86:00 - 86:04)
they gave us one hershey fu (86:02 - 86:07)
they clearly care about limiting what (86:04 - 86:07)
they (86:07 - 86:09)
they clearly over the years have cared (86:07 - 86:10)
about limiting legends (86:09 - 86:12)
yeah then they put earth it's all been (86:10 - 86:15)
an accident it's all been coincidence (86:12 - 86:17)
[Music] (86:15 - 86:20)
you're assuming they're giving you the (86:17 - 86:22)
other urshifu (86:20 - 86:24)
they're giving you you're paying just (86:22 - 86:25)
like they they (86:24 - 86:27)
make things easy over time here are more (86:25 - 86:29)
mints on the ground here is (86:27 - 86:32)
armoritor here is more there (86:29 - 86:35)
they do make things easier over time (86:32 - 86:38)
but let's not let's not pretend that (86:35 - 86:40)
they don't care about limiting (86:38 - 86:42)
your legends so but are you also then (86:40 - 86:43)
saying (86:42 - 86:46)
that you will only ever again get one (86:43 - 86:47)
articudo (86:46 - 86:50)
den spawn ever and once that's done (86:47 - 86:53)
you will never see another articuno yeah (86:50 - 86:54)
once you go through the ultra wormhole (86:53 - 86:57)
and you catch mewtwo (86:54 - 86:58)
there's no more ultra wormholes with (86:57 - 87:00)
mewtwo anymore right (86:58 - 87:01)
it's gone you did it i don't know i (87:00 - 87:04)
didn't do ultra wormholes (87:01 - 87:05)
what's the difference of going through (87:04 - 87:07)
an ultra wormhole and going through a (87:05 - 87:07)
raid den (87:07 - 87:10)
besides that you can do it with people (87:07 - 87:11)
that's the only difference (87:10 - 87:15)
but so what you're saying is (87:11 - 87:17)
it so do you think it'll be a 100 catch (87:15 - 87:19)
rate for the for the person (87:17 - 87:21)
for the for the person that starts the (87:19 - 87:22)
raid (87:21 - 87:23)
if you go through a landorus rate and (87:22 - 87:25)
you throw one pokeball and you don't (87:23 - 87:26)
catch the lander risk do you (87:25 - 87:29)
do the whole thing again like that (87:26 - 87:30)
that's a bad experience (87:29 - 87:34)
if like if i really yes yeah (87:30 - 87:36)
yeah but if okay so this goes back to (87:34 - 87:38)
your guys's original argument (87:36 - 87:40)
if i convince three friends hey i want (87:38 - 87:42)
to do landorus will catches the landorus (87:40 - 87:43)
i don't greg doesn't (87:42 - 87:46)
um uh horcapus doesn't (87:43 - 87:49)
what what what is will's uh agreement to (87:46 - 87:49)
be like (87:49 - 87:51)
oh i already got the landorus why would (87:49 - 87:53)
i want to do it again it took 20 minutes (87:51 - 87:53)
i (87:53 - 87:56)
i want to go ride my bike yeah i do want (87:53 - 87:57)
to go ride my bike (87:56 - 88:00)
you're right like even even if everyone (87:57 - 88:01)
gets to catch it and everyone gets to (88:00 - 88:03)
throw one ball because that's how it's (88:01 - 88:05)
always been for dynamaxx raids (88:03 - 88:06)
if three of your friends catch it and (88:05 - 88:08)
you don't (88:06 - 88:11)
we we know that people are selfish so (88:08 - 88:13)
why do they want to help you do it again (88:11 - 88:15)
i mean there's a ton of people who do (88:13 - 88:16)
want to help you do it they are like (88:15 - 88:18)
your destiny problem but (88:16 - 88:21)
but what i'm asking is do you think that (88:18 - 88:24)
there are how many legendaries are there (88:21 - 88:26)
there are 50 thousands (88:24 - 88:28)
there are only 50 dens that have these (88:26 - 88:30)
in here and once you catch one (88:28 - 88:34)
that den is shut down and (88:30 - 88:36)
you will never see another articuno no (88:34 - 88:38)
you know what that's what i honestly (88:36 - 88:42)
honestly and truly i think what (88:38 - 88:44)
now i'm putting all the pieces together (88:42 - 88:46)
here i've got a big (88:44 - 88:49)
board with pictures and and string and (88:46 - 88:50)
thumb tacks and (88:49 - 88:52)
and all it's all tying together here's (88:50 - 88:53)
the answer (88:52 - 88:57)
i finally cracked it because (88:53 - 89:00)
and and i blame steve you (88:57 - 89:05)
have ruined pokemon okay fair because (89:00 - 89:09)
you have 400 legendaries (89:05 - 89:11)
in pokemon go that you are going to (89:09 - 89:13)
transfer into pokemon home which you (89:11 - 89:14)
could then (89:13 - 89:17)
transfer into sword and shield if you (89:14 - 89:17)
want (89:17 - 89:21)
they're like that's it legendaries are (89:17 - 89:21)
busted (89:21 - 89:23)
everybody get 400 legendaries they're (89:21 - 89:25)
not special anymore steve (89:23 - 89:28)
i ruined it i paid a dollar for every (89:25 - 89:29)
one of those (89:28 - 89:33)
i paid 60 dollars 400 you could have (89:29 - 89:34)
bought a (89:33 - 89:36)
put a good down payment on a ps5 but (89:34 - 89:37)
instead (89:36 - 89:39)
you've ruined pokemon this is what i (89:37 - 89:41)
think did you (89:39 - 89:44)
in auris were there multiple hoops or (89:41 - 89:46)
did when you caught one out of that (89:44 - 89:49)
hoop did it did that hoop disappear yes (89:46 - 89:52)
once you caught azelf in the hoop for (89:49 - 89:54)
auras you could never catch another as (89:52 - 89:56)
of once you caught (89:54 - 89:59)
a tarakian in the ultra wormhole you (89:56 - 90:01)
could not catch another track in (89:59 - 90:04)
i don't see why this would be different (90:01 - 90:08)
no i mean maybe it's that way but maybe (90:04 - 90:11)
when you when if if maybe if it's like (90:08 - 90:12)
the leader of the party is the only one (90:11 - 90:14)
that can catch it then when you go back (90:12 - 90:15)
it says (90:14 - 90:16)
hey you can't be the leader you've (90:15 - 90:19)
already defeated this den (90:16 - 90:21)
if you if it's like every single raid (90:19 - 90:23)
battle where you can only throw one (90:21 - 90:24)
pokeball (90:23 - 90:26)
and you do not catch it i think that is (90:24 - 90:28)
a bad experience for everyone (90:26 - 90:29)
especially because it's not like you're (90:28 - 90:32)
going into landorus directly (90:29 - 90:34)
you are probably having to do five raid (90:32 - 90:36)
battles before that (90:34 - 90:38)
and hopefully that is fun we've done (90:36 - 90:40)
raid battles for the last year (90:38 - 90:42)
we know what rey battles are i don't (90:40 - 90:43)
know if they're going to make them (90:42 - 90:44)
suddenly (90:43 - 90:47)
more fun i would guess that you (90:44 - 90:50)
don't catch the legend at the end (90:47 - 90:51)
because you're you can't guarantee to (90:50 - 90:52)
catch it (90:51 - 90:54)
anyways unless they're giving the host a (90:52 - 90:56)
hundred percent catch rate (90:54 - 90:58)
and then when you defeat landorus for (90:56 - 90:59)
example then (90:58 - 91:01)
landorus will spawn in the overworld (90:59 - 91:04)
where you can walk up to it at any point (91:01 - 91:06)
and then catch it on your own that would (91:04 - 91:08)
prove i like that concept that would (91:06 - 91:09)
prevent people (91:08 - 91:12)
from would would anybody who was in that (91:09 - 91:13)
raid be able to catch it (91:12 - 91:16)
that i i don't know i don't know how (91:13 - 91:18)
that would communicate back to the game (91:16 - 91:20)
because that's a really weird sort of (91:18 - 91:21)
hey (91:20 - 91:24)
help me activate my laboratories yeah (91:21 - 91:26)
well that's better to activate landorus (91:24 - 91:27)
together (91:26 - 91:29)
yeah but that's better than like hey (91:27 - 91:30)
help me do landorus oh cool (91:29 - 91:32)
you caught it i didn't you wanna hate (91:30 - 91:35)
you you want to help me again (91:32 - 91:38)
and it prevents the issue of let's do (91:35 - 91:38)
landorus (91:38 - 91:41)
you got you three catch it i'll reset so (91:38 - 91:44)
mylanderis isn't permanently gone i just (91:41 - 91:46)
can't imagine the the (91:44 - 91:48)
game freak's gonna let you catch like 14 (91:46 - 91:50)
landorus (91:48 - 91:52)
why you already have yeah but they i (91:50 - 91:54)
mean yeah but they made me pay a dollar (91:52 - 91:55)
every time (91:54 - 91:58)
that's the difference nobody made you (91:55 - 91:58)
pay that (91:58 - 92:01)
i mean you chose they made you pay 15 (91:58 - 92:04)
ahead of time (92:01 - 92:04)
i mean the only reason i think that (92:05 - 92:12)
possibly the legends spawn in the wild (92:08 - 92:15)
is because we see articuno flying over (92:12 - 92:17)
the trainer in the trailer (92:15 - 92:19)
um yeah but we didn't know if that's (92:17 - 92:21)
part of the story could be part of the (92:19 - 92:22)
story yeah (92:21 - 92:23)
we don't know what that is like why is (92:22 - 92:25)
articuno look weird now we can't (92:23 - 92:28)
base any of any of uh (92:25 - 92:32)
uh one screenshot off of oh (92:28 - 92:34)
was it a screenshot of this video it was (92:32 - 92:35)
a video but (92:34 - 92:37)
like it was two seconds we also don't (92:35 - 92:38)
know how (92:37 - 92:40)
kaylee rex spawns or if that's gonna be (92:38 - 92:42)
an array then (92:40 - 92:44)
it's just i mean there's a lot of both (92:42 - 92:46)
ways it can go i mean it's a bad (92:44 - 92:48)
experience (92:46 - 92:50)
in a lot of ways if like all these raid (92:48 - 92:52)
dents disappear (92:50 - 92:55)
and like the big selling point on (92:52 - 92:57)
crown tundra is all these legendaries (92:55 - 92:59)
are in raids (92:57 - 93:01)
and that's a limited time thing that is (92:59 - 93:04)
a very limited time thing for (93:01 - 93:06)
you enjoying this dlc unless there's a (93:04 - 93:08)
whole bunch of other stuff that they've (93:06 - 93:10)
added i don't i don't think the rides (93:08 - 93:11)
are gonna be limited i mean catching (93:10 - 93:14)
50 legendary pokemon there's no way (93:11 - 93:15)
you're going to be able to do that in a (93:14 - 93:16)
day (93:15 - 93:19)
especially if you have to do cut to cut (93:16 - 93:22)
cut to the 23rd and somebody has done it (93:19 - 93:24)
all yeah maybe but if (93:22 - 93:27)
if they are restricted maybe i guarantee (93:24 - 93:30)
you but if you have to do five raid (93:27 - 93:34)
battles before you get to a legend (93:30 - 93:37)
raid battles are not 30 seconds (93:34 - 93:39)
well we don't know that you have to do (93:37 - 93:41)
those five we don't know that that we (93:39 - 93:42)
know that there will be (93:41 - 93:44)
endless dynamics adventures and we know (93:42 - 93:45)
that they'll be (93:44 - 93:46)
that but we don't know that there's (93:45 - 93:48)
always going to be a five ahead of time (93:46 - 93:50)
we have no idea if there's some that are (93:48 - 93:52)
just go straight to the legendary and (93:50 - 93:53)
some that are (93:52 - 93:55)
walk through stuff and then get like we (93:53 - 93:57)
have no idea what that looks like (93:55 - 93:59)
like we don't know what this heart up in (93:57 - 94:01)
the corner of the screenshot means there (93:59 - 94:03)
are four hearts in the corner (94:01 - 94:06)
what does that mean yeah uh oh zelda (94:03 - 94:09)
crossover i think the dynomax adventure (94:06 - 94:10)
is how you get it it says try swapping (94:09 - 94:12)
out your pokemon as you explore (94:10 - 94:14)
uh whenever you seek the legendary (94:12 - 94:16)
pokemon that lurks in the depths (94:14 - 94:17)
and when you delve even deeper endless (94:16 - 94:19)
dynomax may be the thing for you endless (94:17 - 94:21)
dynamics lets you keep going until you (94:19 - 94:21)
lose (94:21 - 94:24)
so specifically in the explore the (94:21 - 94:26)
pokemon dens and dynamaxx adventure it (94:24 - 94:27)
says like (94:26 - 94:30)
how as you seek legendary pokemon i'm (94:27 - 94:31)
not saying every legendary pokemon is (94:30 - 94:32)
gonna be there (94:31 - 94:35)
i'm assuming uh cash register and uh (94:32 - 94:40)
reggie drago are probably going to be (94:35 - 94:42)
more storyline focused as well as (94:40 - 94:43)
articuno (94:42 - 94:46)
zapdos and maltrice more storyline (94:43 - 94:47)
focused and probably (94:46 - 94:49)
calaric's more storyline focused but we (94:47 - 94:52)
see like we see landorus in a max raid (94:49 - 94:54)
we see tapu coco in a max raid we see (94:52 - 94:55)
red (94:54 - 94:58)
red red ice in what looks to be a cave (94:55 - 95:00)
which normally the reggies are always in (94:58 - 95:00)
a cave (95:00 - 95:02)
and then we see the trainer using um a (95:00 - 95:05)
verisian in the snowy field (95:02 - 95:06)
well that's not appropriate because (95:05 - 95:08)
version is grass (95:06 - 95:11)
i i i think 50 unique raids (95:08 - 95:14)
for 50 legendary pokemon is a lot of (95:11 - 95:16)
content i don't doubt that (95:14 - 95:18)
if it's not fun the first time it ain't (95:16 - 95:21)
going to be fun the 50th time (95:18 - 95:21)
i would say that the the hoopa thing was (95:24 - 95:28)
pretty cool (95:27 - 95:30)
although that was on a time limit right (95:28 - 95:32)
like it was only like certain rings (95:30 - 95:33)
spawned on certain days and people would (95:32 - 95:34)
have to reset the clock that was a (95:33 - 95:35)
little annoying (95:34 - 95:37)
i would say the ultra wormhole stuff was (95:35 - 95:39)
fun i thought it was fun i know not (95:37 - 95:41)
everyone loved all the wormhole (95:39 - 95:42)
but you know if i was looking for mewtwo (95:41 - 95:44)
i knew i had to go to the (95:42 - 95:46)
i think mewtwo was like blue or yellow (95:44 - 95:48)
or something so i would keep trying to (95:46 - 95:49)
go for yellows (95:48 - 95:51)
i guess we'll know in like three weeks (95:49 - 95:52)
so yeah yep (95:51 - 95:55)
uh the ability patch is being introduced (95:52 - 95:57)
in crown tundra you get a you can get (95:55 - 95:59)
new eye (95:57 - 96:00)
in the crown tundra you may get new (95:59 - 96:02)
items called ability patches (96:00 - 96:03)
that are hard to come by but worth the (96:02 - 96:05)
effort if you use one on a pokemon the (96:03 - 96:07)
ability will change the species hidden (96:05 - 96:09)
ability if it has one (96:07 - 96:11)
finally with an ability patch and (96:09 - 96:12)
helping a max (96:11 - 96:14)
it doesn't say if you can get rid of the (96:12 - 96:16)
hidden ability here (96:14 - 96:19)
um which is maybe the problem (96:16 - 96:21)
with an ability patch and the helping of (96:19 - 96:22)
max soup on the olive armor you can (96:21 - 96:24)
bring out the hidden ability of your (96:22 - 96:24)
first (96:24 - 96:26)
partner pokemon that you chose at the (96:24 - 96:27)
beginning of sword and shield with the (96:26 - 96:29)
capability of giganta maxing as well (96:27 - 96:32)
so you can get a grassy ger surge your (96:29 - 96:33)
your starting (96:32 - 96:36)
grookie can be grassy surged and (96:33 - 96:37)
gigantomax (96:36 - 96:40)
and minted you can have it all finally (96:37 - 96:44)
now let me change the ball greg you ask (96:40 - 96:45)
too much (96:44 - 96:49)
come on that's not too much (96:45 - 96:50)
and then finally uh there is the (96:49 - 96:52)
gallerian star tournament once you (96:50 - 96:54)
progress far enough in the crown tundra (96:52 - 96:55)
you will be able to participate in the (96:54 - 96:56)
gallerian star (96:55 - 96:58)
tournament held in wyndon this (96:56 - 97:01)
tournament is leon's brainchild intended (96:58 - 97:03)
to fire up the spirits of the gala (97:01 - 97:04)
region (97:03 - 97:06)
once you accept leon's invitation you (97:04 - 97:08)
will be able to pick a partner pokemon (97:06 - 97:10)
among the many trainers you've met (97:08 - 97:11)
throughout sword and shield as well as (97:10 - 97:13)
the expansion pass team up for (97:11 - 97:14)
multi-battle tournament depending on who (97:13 - 97:16)
your partner and who your opponents are (97:14 - 97:18)
you will meet you will see a glimpse of (97:16 - 97:21)
new sides of familiar faces (97:18 - 97:24)
so we have a new area (97:21 - 97:28)
we have cali rex we have it says new (97:24 - 97:29)
regional forms but that's (97:28 - 97:31)
really misleading because it's literally (97:29 - 97:33)
just slow bro (97:31 - 97:35)
slow king sorry pokemon that did the (97:33 - 97:36)
birds (97:35 - 97:38)
no no no the legendary birds the (97:36 - 97:41)
reggie's the reggie's and two reggies (97:38 - 97:43)
those aren't forms those are true new (97:41 - 97:44)
pokemon (97:43 - 97:47)
we have pokemon wait i thought reggie (97:44 - 97:49)
steele and reg ice and they all got new (97:47 - 97:50)
forms (97:49 - 97:53)
two brand new reggies we have pokemon (97:50 - 97:55)
that didn't appear in sword and shield (97:53 - 97:58)
like spheel garchomp the new pokedex (97:55 - 98:00)
so hopefully we get something when we (97:58 - 98:02)
complete that pokedex (98:00 - 98:05)
we have a new clothing item cool (98:02 - 98:08)
new pokemon added makes max raid battles (98:05 - 98:10)
new items (98:08 - 98:13)
uh and then new co-op (98:10 - 98:16)
play mode which is did they ever fix the (98:13 - 98:18)
numbers for the pokedex for isle of (98:16 - 98:19)
armor (98:18 - 98:23)
fix the numbers so when isle of armor (98:19 - 98:24)
first came out (98:23 - 98:27)
if you caught a pokemon that is an isle (98:24 - 98:29)
of armor in the isle of armor expanded (98:27 - 98:32)
pokedex it did not have a pokedex number (98:29 - 98:35)
so you didn't really know where you were (98:32 - 98:37)
in the order of pokemon that were (98:35 - 98:39)
available in isle of armor (98:37 - 98:40)
don't i guess this is something i could (98:39 - 98:43)
find out for myself somebody would know (98:40 - 98:46)
the issue was no no the issue was if you (98:43 - 98:47)
moved a pokemon from (98:46 - 98:50)
home into the isle of armor the isle of (98:47 - 98:51)
armor (98:50 - 98:53)
didn't recognize that you caught it that (98:51 - 98:55)
was the issue (98:53 - 98:57)
that's not my issue my issue is i want (98:55 - 98:58)
to see a number (98:57 - 99:02)
up in the corner this is (98:58 - 99:05)
i've got this one of this many (99:02 - 99:07)
that i'm expected to get so i have an (99:05 - 99:10)
idea of what my target is (99:07 - 99:11)
i guess i don't know what number you're (99:10 - 99:13)
talking about pokedex number (99:11 - 99:16)
yeah it had one it was like it was like (99:13 - 99:17)
uh (99:16 - 99:21)
one out of 206 or something no no no (99:17 - 99:23)
the original that you get the glare and (99:21 - 99:24)
pokedex from (99:23 - 99:28)
one to four hundred when you started (99:24 - 99:30)
catching isle of armor pokemon (99:28 - 99:32)
they did not have a pokedex number mine (99:30 - 99:34)
did they did not start at 401. (99:32 - 99:36)
no no no because that pokedex is done (99:34 - 99:38)
two different pokedexes just like in sun (99:36 - 99:40)
and moon you had the melamele pokedex (99:38 - 99:41)
you had the (99:40 - 99:44)
island when i go when i go in to (99:41 - 99:46)
look at my pokemon in their boxes (99:44 - 99:48)
there's no pokedex number (99:46 - 99:50)
in the little spot where our pokedex (99:48 - 99:51)
number is supposed to appear (99:50 - 99:53)
well not all pokemon have a pokedex (99:51 - 99:55)
number like popplio and rowlet don't (99:53 - 99:56)
have a pokedex number because they're (99:55 - 99:59)
technically not in the pokedex (99:56 - 100:02)
but like sharpedo should have a pokedex (99:59 - 100:02)
number (100:02 - 100:05)
for the isle of armor i think (100:02 - 100:08)
um it does not i see what you're saying (100:05 - 100:10)
and i raised this q i raised this issue (100:08 - 100:12)
to you a long time ago and you're like (100:10 - 100:12)
yeah they (100:12 - 100:16)
that's a bug no the bug was trading a (100:12 - 100:17)
pokemon from home (100:16 - 100:19)
into it did not register properly they (100:17 - 100:21)
did fix that they fixed that (100:19 - 100:22)
well thank goodness for that i think (100:21 - 100:24)
that the same weekend they got rid of (100:22 - 100:27)
shiny zamasunta in raids because people (100:24 - 100:29)
were hacking those in (100:27 - 100:31)
i see what you're saying because it only (100:29 - 100:33)
goes up to 400 (100:31 - 100:36)
so like there's no 401 for like sharpedo (100:33 - 100:38)
yeah yes no that that has never been (100:36 - 100:40)
addressed (100:38 - 100:42)
which aggravates the head you also (100:40 - 100:44)
cannot search for popplio in (100:42 - 100:46)
in the search feature which is (100:44 - 100:47)
incredibly infuriating if you were (100:46 - 100:48)
looking for a (100:47 - 100:51)
popplio to put a pre-marina on your team (100:48 - 100:53)
what (100:51 - 100:55)
you can't wait when you like go to all (100:53 - 100:56)
boxes and you do like type (100:55 - 100:59)
moves ability pokemon if you go to (100:56 - 101:00)

through this really quickly since we (103:49 - 103:52)
have been going for a long time (103:51 - 103:53)
i'm going to go through all the (103:52 - 103:55)
questions i will give you the correct (103:53 - 103:56)
answer and then greg you can tell me (103:55 - 103:58)
what the right answer is at the end (103:56 - 104:01)
steve you can say chat okay uh question (103:58 - 104:02)
one which of the following types has (104:01 - 104:04)
been represented by only one starting (104:02 - 104:06)
pokemon evolution (104:04 - 104:09)
fighting steel ground dragon (104:06 - 104:12)
correct answer was b steel question two (104:09 - 104:13)
which is the following and (104:12 - 104:15)
also for everybody out there mega (104:13 - 104:16)
evolutions (104:15 - 104:19)
are evolutions mega sceptile (104:16 - 104:22)
mega charizard both dragon type yep (104:19 - 104:23)
question two (104:22 - 104:25)
which of the following types has been (104:23 - 104:26)
represented by only one starting pokemon (104:25 - 104:28)
evolution poison dark rock (104:26 - 104:32)
or ghost ghost ghost correct that would (104:28 - 104:32)
be (104:32 - 104:35)
uh decidueye question three which the (104:32 - 104:36)
following phrases (104:35 - 104:38)
is a mispronunciation of a phrase (104:36 - 104:40)
meaning to give specific focus (104:38 - 104:44)
orchest house cleaning hone in (104:40 - 104:48)
shine a light on hone in hone in yes (104:44 - 104:49)
because it's actually (104:48 - 104:53)
home in with an m not an n (104:49 - 104:55)
uh question four in fencing the phrase (104:53 - 104:57)
on guard means the opposite of the (104:55 - 104:58)
pokemon ability (104:57 - 105:01)
wonder guard no guard magic guard or (104:58 - 105:02)
friend guard (105:01 - 105:05)
no guard correct because on guard means (105:02 - 105:05)
to (105:05 - 105:07)
protect yourself and the no guard (105:05 - 105:09)
ability (105:07 - 105:10)
basically means that you can't protect (105:09 - 105:13)
yourself (105:10 - 105:16)
there's no ability to to avoid damage (105:13 - 105:17)
question five the following anime (105:16 - 105:20)
character used this week's pokemon in an (105:17 - 105:20)
episode (105:20 - 105:23)
before evolving it sawyer ash (105:20 - 105:27)
horcapus or serena harkipus (105:23 - 105:31)
no archips used to charge a (105:27 - 105:31)
all right because ash doesn't evolve (105:34 - 105:38)
anything (105:36 - 105:38)
occasionally all right who is the (105:38 - 105:46)
pokemon of the week (105:42 - 105:46)
[Music] (105:48 - 105:54)
shut up it's hoenege hone edge (105:50 - 105:57)
you are correct it is a steel ghost (105:54 - 106:00)
ghost steel hohn (105:57 - 106:04)
edge which means hone means to sharpen (106:00 - 106:07)
has the ability no guard and (106:04 - 106:11)
sawyer had one in the anime uh shuffle (106:07 - 106:14)
real good icon i like the red blade (106:11 - 106:16)
shiny (106:14 - 106:18)
yeah good job it's a good contrasty (106:16 - 106:20)
shiny the amount of people (106:18 - 106:23)
that came into my twitch stream and (106:20 - 106:24)
asked why i wasn't using magnet pole on (106:23 - 106:25)
hoenege (106:24 - 106:30)
was infuriating because magnet poll (106:25 - 106:33)
is an ability that outside of battle (106:30 - 106:35)
if a pokemon with magnet pole is placed (106:33 - 106:37)
in the first the party even when fainted (106:35 - 106:38)
there's a fifty percent (106:37 - 106:40)
chance the game will force an encounter (106:38 - 106:42)
with a steel type pokemon (106:40 - 106:46)
but in generation six (106:42 - 106:47)
the same generation honage was (106:46 - 106:50)
introduced steel type pokemon with the (106:47 - 106:51)
additional ghost (106:50 - 106:54)
typing are unaffected by magnet pull (106:51 - 106:57)
correct and uh the hone edge line are (106:54 - 106:58)
the only steel ghost (106:57 - 107:01)
so magnet pole does not work on honed (106:58 - 107:03)
and the amount of people that were like (107:01 - 107:05)
well it worked for me (107:03 - 107:08)
just just shows (107:05 - 107:13)
what is that confirmation bias yep yep (107:08 - 107:16)
it doesn't work you can uh (107:13 - 107:19)
deck what was that thing called radar (107:16 - 107:20)
scan (107:19 - 107:23)
for honeage the one who does it i've (107:20 - 107:24)
never (107:23 - 107:26)
done that you mean deck snap dexnet no (107:24 - 107:27)
no no (107:26 - 107:30)
the the sun and moon the scan the qr (107:27 - 107:31)
codes (107:30 - 107:33)
oh oh island island scan that's what (107:31 - 107:34)
it's called you can island scan for (107:33 - 107:35)
honing in that game (107:34 - 107:38)
um or i mean i think it's pretty (107:35 - 107:39)
straightforward to hunted and sword and (107:38 - 107:41)
shield now you can just literally see (107:39 - 107:44)
thousands of them in the wild area when (107:41 - 107:44)
it's (107:44 - 107:48)
foggy i think (107:44 - 107:48)
what's our pokemon next week okay (107:48 - 107:55)
pokemon for this week short sweet easy (107:52 - 107:57)
out of all the fruit vegetable and food (107:55 - 107:59)
based pokemon only one has a name that (107:57 - 108:01)
starts with the letter b (107:59 - 108:04)
this pokemon is based on a deep purple (108:01 - 108:06)
fruit grown in southeast asia (108:04 - 108:08)
it is difficult to find in the united (108:06 - 108:09)
states because (108:08 - 108:12)
it was banned for a very long time (108:09 - 108:14)
banned because of fear that importing (108:12 - 108:16)
the fruit would introduce a particular (108:14 - 108:19)
fly to the americas from asia (108:16 - 108:21)
as it stands the fruit must be (108:19 - 108:23)
irradiated (108:21 - 108:26)
as part of the import process (108:23 - 108:28)
the first and only time i ever tried to (108:26 - 108:30)
eat one i bit into it (108:28 - 108:33)
which you should not do as its rind is (108:30 - 108:37)
basically wood there you go (108:33 - 108:40)
is it just the eggplant emoji (108:37 - 108:42)
yeah yes pokemon of the week is the (108:40 - 108:43)
eggplant emoji (108:42 - 108:47)
have you eaten an eggplant (108:43 - 108:50)
why would i i like i like how his like (108:47 - 108:51)
whole thing is like why would i eat an (108:50 - 108:52)
eggplant (108:51 - 108:54)
because they're delicious they are good (108:52 - 108:56)
well (108:54 - 108:59)
but their skin is not wood actually (108:56 - 109:03)
their skin is edible all right eggplant (108:59 - 109:04)
parmesan (109:03 - 109:07)
mmm no no you gotta get the chinese like (109:04 - 109:07)
the (109:07 - 109:09)
the sejuan eggplant oh that is very good (109:07 - 109:11)
ooh tea house up here just (109:09 - 109:12)

favorites you are listening to this (109:12 - 109:15)
podcast before (109:14 - 109:17)

is still open (109:17 - 109:20)
it is uh in the show notes if you want (109:18 - 109:21)
to click the link completely free to (109:20 - 109:22)
enter (109:21 - 109:26)
uh we will be streaming crown tundra (109:22 - 109:29)
on the 23rd i will probably be streaming (109:26 - 109:30)
till midnight when it comes out but (109:29 - 109:34)
what i like to do is i like when (109:30 - 109:36)
the people watching are ahead of me so (109:34 - 109:38)
then they are not worried about spoilers (109:36 - 109:41)
so everyone who is the hardcore can play (109:38 - 109:43)
the night it comes out and then i will (109:41 - 109:45)
start on the 23rd at noon (109:43 - 109:47)
central time and then we'll stream for (109:45 - 109:48)
12 hours so (109:47 - 109:49)
you know if you're watching you won't (109:48 - 109:50)
have to worry about spoilers as long as (109:49 - 109:52)
you started before (109:50 - 109:55)
i did which is probably very likely (109:52 - 109:58)
unless you work i guess (109:55 - 109:59)
also i'm assuming the story is gonna be (109:58 - 110:01)
like less than two hours long just like (109:59 - 110:02)
isle of armor (110:01 - 110:03)
so i don't know how much spoilers there (110:02 - 110:06)
will be long stream on the 23rd (110:03 - 110:08)
when it comes out twitch.tv slash pkm (110:06 - 110:10)
and cast we'll still have episodes we (110:08 - 110:11)
probably won't do a mini series i don't (110:10 - 110:13)
think when miniseries was needed for the (110:11 - 110:14)
isle of armor (110:13 - 110:18)
that episode on the 25th will probably (110:14 - 110:19)
not talk about the story (110:18 - 110:20)
