we're a pokemon podcast i'm your host sbj that's all out of the way with me is will everything is wrong everything is wrong it is dark outside my window i barely know where i am or who i am and yet

youtube channel okay hold on will is working out okay nobody wants to see that are talking star wars and i'm sitting there drinking different types of water but expressing that only through facial expressions because i don't want to interrupt you talking about star wars okay i'm into it no this is this is a scam and i like i i called it out as a scam in the first place and it continues to be a scam because i literally created a channel in our slack community called freshwater and steve has not commented in that channel once i was invited i specifically invited you wasn't invited you could learn all about all the different waters of the world you could learn about my misadventures of buying period fusion which i thought was a water but it turns out they put sugar in it and he's got 45 calories i was almost banned from the channel for even mentioning it this sounds like a channel i want to be in it's a very good channel we we you you can learn about waterloo you can learn about aha you can learn about bubbly you can learn about polar spring heck i saw in my cub downstairs that we have a a mendota water oh yeah cool water's good we're gonna get into it we're gonna have all the details and discussions and the and the hot takes yeah all the flavors all the new flavors all the hot flavors that are coming out so we have it's international what flavors you can and cannot get in canada and which grocery stores carry which of the of the different and the the pepsi versus coke war of bubbly versus aha oh man we got it all we got and you can't stand it on the sidelines we have which flavor should i try which is a better flavor pineapple or watermelon there is a fast-moving high-impact channel and you just sleep on it you just you claim that you're like this water expert and you clearly don't care well he claims that he's passionate about water and yet a yeah tremendous water resource has been placed at his feet and he has just stepped over it and ignored it he walked on by like that's a good song i heard that at the gym too oh it is a good song speaking of walking on by we have a show for you that we're gonna walk into your ears oh uh do you see the transit okay we gotta we got some pokemon knows to go see the transition pokemon news to go through here i know what an exciting nintendo direct i don't even know why we're going to have a pokemon day with how much

really was really too long 12 dollars oh boy i'm not sure if i could have recommended this uh okay that was the that's probably why where's my shiny mew why did we eat since the food court at the mall of america is closed yeah that's that is the question of the hour yeah that's probably going to be the biggest question not how many shinies are which shinies what did we end up eating throughout the year is actually a hotel that's about four blocks from the mall of america still too far to walk in these temperatures but it has the best french fries i've ever eaten in my entire life i'm down which one well you don't want to give it away you they got to wait until the next podcast oh yeah i don't want them to run out of fries that's right text it to me okay as we're texting here let's get into the pokemon news there was some news we didn't cover last week but we were we're covering it now let's start with post malone yeah i still don't know who that is he does circles he does uh sunshine i think and he did the cover of that other song that the one that made him famous he's got the tattoo on his face that says always tired and then everybody else got a tattoo on their face and you're like even it was questionable on him people say oh it's a tattoo face guy and i'm like oh that's a lot of that's a lot of people i mean we have listeners to this program that are tattoo face guys and then they're like oh it does all those songs and then i'm like i don't know those songs so then i go to youtube and they pull up the songs and i listen to those songs and then promptly an hour later no longer remember the songs that's how much i don't care about them or care for them is that you're a snooty snob and you don't listen to the good pop music yeah that's why will's on the show he's into the good music i'm not a pop person i'm not you don't listen to music you don't like i gave up on music yeah i retired from i mean i retired if you want will anderson's hot takes right now now

pokemon 25th anniversary celebration the year-long celebration of 25 years of pokemon is off to a rousing start their words not mine and things are about to get even more exciting again their words not mine be sure to watch the upcoming virtual concert featuring the global superstar and lifelong pokemon fan post malone plus don't miss a poke don't miss the pokemon distribution and sword and shield isn't he only 25 years old he is only 25 yes look when he was born they handed him a game boy and pokemon blue here you go a nostalgic event in pokemon go that's happened a couple days ago because this came out on monday and a collection of music themed pokemon series episodes on pokemon tv the p25 music program celebrates the pokemon landmark's 25th anniversary with some of the biggest names in music so far we know too post malone and katy perry yeah and they're already some of the biggest names in music this is true that's true that's not a lie their words not ours kick uh kicks that that kicks off on pokemon day which is february 27th with the post malone virtual concert fans will be able to tune in for free on the con uh for the tune into this free concert on pokemon 25th anniversary website which is 25.pokemon.com on the official pokemon youtube channel uh or on the official pokemon twitch channel that is starting at 4 pm pst after the concert more details about p25 music will be revealed so stick around after the show all right i have us i have a question about the concert what percentage will be remakes of the many pokemon theme songs oh 95 right a large amount i so the thing is post malone did like his career started with him doing a cover of somebody's song which was a very notable and well-regarded cover so dude knows how to do covers so poke rap in right oh 100 uh you know out all the songs yeah maybe i guess team rockets rocking yeah that's got to be in there we're on the road to viridian city okay you're just reading off the to be a master album right now no i at first i don't have enough and i'm doing this for memory do we think they'll do the black and white theme song which is the book okay is this is this gonna be like we're just gonna do every is this just gonna be we're gonna do every pokemon theme song by different artists or is this gonna be actually like original songs but even when m2m did i don't remember that song for the i remember the title of the song but it was m2m and they did the song for the mewtwo movie but that wasn't an original song it first debuted on the radio and then that first way to get the song that wasn't on the radio was to buy the pokemon album because itunes didn't exist at the time because cassettes and cds were the the fad back not the fat it was just the standard wasn't the chicken band song original for that video that was really good chicken oh um arcadia i think the song is called yeah yeah it was by the deep roasted chicken or something well wait didn't the presidents of the united states of america do they did a pokemon song they did it wasn't that an original song oh it was pokey rap the poker rap for it was like after gen 5 right yeah uh i would assume i have it in my collection the pokemon journeys theme song what is that by lost children yeah i mean the real secret is that it's gonna it's gonna be like nick burgess is gonna be the star yeah and is going to do a two-hour performance of pokemon themed bleep flops is it going to be post malone live or is it going to be the animated post malone character that they showed in there's no way it's live this is already recorded they've already done it no i'm saying but is it going to be live as in it's a human being or is it going to be the animated avatar that they made for the trailer i think it's going to be the animated avatar they didn't even see how long it's going to be it's starting at 4 p.m like a minute like like like what kind of concert we talking is this is this like an hour concert is this a 10 minute concert is this the three hour concert like what's happening here and also if it's animated they can have as many guests as they want because those people actually literally didn't have to go anywhere yep right it's totally animated also isn't post malone a very not pg musician yes i wouldn't know well i mean he's he's not he's also a producer as well he does produce music as well i mean dude are we asking if there should be an explicit next to him no no i'm sure the music he will do for the concert will be like all ages he has some all ages tracks he's not like every single song of his is not explicit well well i guess neither is katy perry nope more of this press release there are some great events happening in pokemon video games starting on february 25th people uh players can add a special pikachu to their copy of certain shield uh you will find the password here on pokemon.com and on pokemon's 25th anniversary and on official social media the password will also be distributed via the pokemon trainers club's newsletter yeah good luck and it's fine just go to the website in keeping with the p25 music celebration pikachu will know the move sing pokemon go players will gear up on february 20th for the kanto tour we already talked about that that already happened that already happened uh we didn't mention this uh it's not mentioned here in the blog post and we mentioned it last week i'll mention it again you'll be able to go to gamestop to get a shiny toxicity starting on the 19th you don't have to go into gamestop you just have to be close enough to gamestop to geo gps geo locate yourself uh i didn't say this last week but i will say this this week it is also available at eb games but though the code will be on a card the old-fashioned way or a receipt because the pokemon pass app is only available for americans uh there is no word for europe or australia or mexico or brazil or literally anywhere that isn't the us and canada that being said from what we know from the pokemon pass app it usually lets you gu get up to three codes when you redeem it for the first time you'll be able to there should be should be is the keyword um a button that says redeem another code you should be able to get three of them uh if you just do that just click the button what you're already at gamestop you don't want to make two trips to the game stock just click the button to get two more codes and then you can take those two codes and you can give them to your australian friends or your uh friends in mexico or wherever right you can do whatever you want put them on ebay and sell them for like two dollars wherever you want yeah ebay ebay i'm gonna make bank [Music] i know pokemon bank is cancelled you're gonna make home uh i'm excited for this concert i don't know what to expect but i am always for pokemon trying new and weird things so agreed if it's if it's a bummer whatever it's free if it's cool it's cool speaking of not cool this is off polygon.com the 2021 pokemon world championships canceled due to covet 19 concerns they were supposed to take place in london in 2019 that was canceled they when they did cancel they'll say don't worry 2021 we'll do it again in london just canceled uh they are saying the pokemon company announced on tuesday that it decided to cancel um the next world championship will take place in 2022 in london same city was planned for 2021 and 2020. quote the safety and well-being of our competitors organizers employees local communities and partners continue to be our top priority and the primary consideration with every decision we make players were invited to the 2021 will be invited back to the 2022 event the pokemon company also said other events part of the official play pokemon series will remain suspended until further notice if players want to compete sooner they have to do so with on with events like the pokemon team challenge pokemon players cup uh there is a players cup that will take place starting in june which will include the trading card game sword and shield and pokken tournament dx other competitions have been canceled due to coveted 19 including the fortnite world cup and evo 2020 yeah that's pretty much the press release it's really hard to have a tournament when you haven't had people playing the last couple months so it kind of kind of makes sense i know it's still very disappointing though but also i'm glad i still haven't gotten my passport so i'm okay yep gives me time the plus side is now you have a whole another year to save up to go to london in theory to piggyback off that again with this we didn't cover this but kashiro harada who is the game director and chief producer who has worked on um tekken games for the past 27 years game director and chief producer i believe of bandai namco what does that matter pogan tournament anyways somebody tweeted at him saying do you consider pokken a one-time only celebration of the great series or are you open to return and make a sequel in the future if you get a chance and uh harada actually tweeted to the person back we have a good relationship with nintendo and the pokemon company uh and pokken has a had a great response i would like to make it again but it's not what we decide it's what they decide i mean it's that's an honest response and i do hope they come out with another pokken the pokken the pokemon company being controlling i would have never thought yeah i just don't know like how old is poking at this point um like the wii u one came out six years ago uh is it five years or six years sure five or six i gotta plug my wii u in because i really like that system so much but what if you just played all those games on the better system called the switch because then i had to buy them again and i already have them i already paid for them on the wii u that's true i mean this is the same company that put out pokken tournament for 60 on the wii u and then put it out again on the switch for 60 dollars see i i want them to come out with a new pokken tournament that has more pokemon available because that i think that was my fault now it doesn't have to be all of them but that was my biggest disappoint with pokken tournament was this just there weren't enough pokemon to choose from i mean when they put it out on the switch you could get like blastoise that oh boy he's cool he has water cannons on his shell yeah that's a blastoise for you i don't i mean i don't why would they not make another pokemon if bandai namco wants to make another pokken if the first one sold like i think what was it like two million copies why didn't they make another pokemon conquest why haven't they made another pokemon ranger yeah why steve well i don't see those companies tweeting on twitter about them wanting to do it you don't know maybe the conquest team didn't want to make another conquest maybe they were like working with a pokemon company was rough i mean it's very like i i imagine that it is yes hey they've got high standards to protect i mean there's also like other contracts right this is the thing we always what i always have to argue about with twitch chat where they're like man i wish they would just make x y z well not specifically pokemon xyz xyz could be anything [Laughter] uh and it's like well they have to find a company to make it and there's not a lot of video game companies just sitting around being like boy i wish somebody came to us to make a game we're really bored here like no most video game companies are working on current games and if they they probably once they're done with their contracts of like hey we we're working with this company our contract to make this game is 18 months they probably because they're successful companies or want to be successful companies they probably already have another game lined up after that contract is over so again they're not in the position of like well we shipped that game what are we gonna do well we'll just sit here and hope that somebody knocks on our door like there's there's only so many video game companies out there doing things so i guess if the pokemon company decided they want another pokken tournament then they would have to go to bandai namco put on the to-do list wait for whatever team work is going to work on it and then start developing it i think it's been long enough for a sequel though i mean if it's been more than five years that seems like a good good length i'd probably play it i probably wouldn't love it just because i don't generally love fighting games but i would like to you know play it for a week and then yeah talk about it and then now play it again what if it's really really good though yeah though speaking of other companies working with the pokemon company this is off go nintendo umbrella the developer behind pokemon rumble has been acquired and dissolved by creatures incorporated uh creatures has a few new people working under their umbrella at the end of the last year creatures inc officially acquired ambrella the company behind pokemon rumble and a few other pokemon related spin-offs since acquiring the company creatures has dissolved it while retaining the employees that were working for it they'll continue as one big team for future projects that makes sense it's it takes away the corporate the unnecessary corporate overhead while still maintaining the knowledge of the employees that have been working i think it's more so like they want the games under the pokemon umbrella not necessarily the people are they going to acquire and dissolve niantic no um because they probably don't know they probably have a good relationship with them maybe not yet this is this is this is just the problem with like miramax oh wait isn't niantic co-owned between google and nintendo and pokemon um i think nintendo's a very very small stake in niantic but niantic is mostly owned by google which wait alphabet i think it's owned by alphabet alphabet yeah if you don't know who umbrella is uh they were founded in 1996 uh they were their own private company they made hey you pikachu in 1998 they made pokemon channel in 2003 they made pokemon dash which was the first official pokemon game on the nintendo ds in 2004. the amazing pokemon dash you forgot we can we talk about years too because there's no other list of games okay so 1998 was hey you pikachu yeah five years later they made pokemon channel which wasn't really a game it was more of like a pet simulator uh a year a year yeah sure a year later they made pokemon dash 2004. a year later they released pokemon dash we got to get away from this idea like they finished pokemon channel in 2003 and then in a year well they could have put pokemon yeah you know in that situation i think they did pump that out in a year uh okay so in 2008 they released my pokemon ranch which was four years between pokemon dash and my pokemon ranch which was i guess if you didn't play my pokemon ranch there's not much to play think of it as like a visual version of pokemon bank in 2009 they released pokemon rumble yep in 2011 so two years later they released pokemon rumble blast and then in another two years they released pokemon rumble u and then another two years they released pokemon rumble world and then in 2017 they put out a you versus the universe which is an arcade game on mobile nothing to do with pokemon or nintendo it was uh they were it was even self-published and in 2019 they put out pokemon rumble rush which was done also a mobile game and that was it not a lot of variety coming from umbrella and i would say i would argue not a lot of hits hey i enjoyed my pokemon ranch yeah i think pokemon ranch is like a really cool concept it would be nice if if you paid 16 a year for a service you could do something more with it like you could with pokemon ranch yeah i mean you could you could whistle and they could come over and dance around you oh they already do that in sword and shield that's true let's not do that but they can't stack on top of each entire other full of them it's yours select six are camping with you ranch they were all there flying overhead zipping around well maybe in pokemon scepter i don't know what is the next one gonna be sword shield crown we already got a crown no they not gonna do a third version they already said that oh you naysayer they don't say they were the ones that said that they're misleading you they're so according to wikipedia in in 2019 creatures had 144 people working for them how many 144 wow game freak according to 2019 had 143 people working for them but i think that's not correct i almost swore that there was an article last year where omori said they're up to like 200 and something employees now i i remember that article because yeah we did talk about that yeah because that was when people were complaining like why don't they just hire more people which it's yeah a very simple solution you just do it overnight right you just knock down the business wall next to you you build a bunch of cubicles you just hire 50 people and you call it a day that's how businesses work i i don't know how many people worked out at umbrella i have no clue i don't know if it was like 12 people i don't know if it was 100 i doubt it was a hundred people if there was a hundred people working on pokemon rumble i don't know who was getting paid i mean they were probably a solid 30 to 40 people i mean it's cool that it doesn't seem like any of them lost their jobs i i do think that like having the i mean yet you right yes yeah i will tell you that it's the new way of acquiring companies is you keep everybody on for the first year because after that first year people stop checking in and then you get rid of all the dead weight in mandatory necessary layoffs to match the market i i would not be surprised though that if this is like pokemon's motive is to get everything they want back oh i'm sure and what i mean by that is the the thing you can point to very easily is miramax when any time there's a pokemon movie marathon anytime there's um anything movie related there's four mirror max movies that they always seem to skip which is destiny deoxys the one where ash kisses latias um dorache wishmaker and gosh what's the last one but miramax technically owns those movies which mirror max is now owned by like disney or something so who knows who owns what but when you when you bought when you just buy out umbrella in this situation you now have all of these things under your belt instead of like maybe you want to use haiti pikachu you gotta go back to umbrella umbrella has to approve it because it's probably they probably have some part ownership of it and now now they just own it whereas i would assume that this is why you know when they do do the movies they have to go back to miramax and miramax probably wants a cut and then they just go you know what we have 16 other movies don't worry about it or max we don't want to give you any money exactly well i mean miramax was bought by disney so i'm i can't imagine that and it's like the pokemon anime isn't on disney anymore it seems they went to a different yeah it seems like gonna be a bit of a thing to get them but we do know the pokemon company is really good at holding out case in point cadabra oh yeah they'll stonewall forever we're not going to give an inch yeah we got 800 million other pokemon we don't need your movies hey uh rumble you used those uh like nfc fake amiibo things back in the day those were funny true the ones you had to get from the eggs maybe maybe that's creatures next goal maybe uh the ones you had to get from the eggs they were pokeballs weren't they like mystery mystery boxes they were mystery boxes yes you had to buy yeah because i remember walking in the game stop and asking if i could buy a whole box i remember oh just like your uh mcdonald's scalping ways no i opened them all and did not sell any of them i don't even think i think i only got one or two doubles because i was because somebody i don't know somebody on some forum says like said like every box was guaranteed like one shiny and you're better off buying a box than just buying individual ones i was like okay i'll buy a box because i want to collect them all i think there was a shiny eevee and a shiny pikachu those those are probably worth 100 bucks each that'd be my guess i think there was a genesect as well i don't know where these amiibo things are you have collected so many things that you have lost track of your collection yes hey you know when i find the keep adding cards when i find the the pre-dated pokemon amiibos i'll put them next to my burger king gold cards and my ancient mew and i'll just let him appreciate speaking of appreciation let's take a break and when we come back we will talk about some more pokemon 25. [Music] i saw a bulbasaur in the real world i saw a bulbasaur in the real world i saw a bulbasaur walking around and it was amazing i saw a bulbasaur walking around and it was amazing we already know that [Music] i saw a bulbasaur i hope it's sweet and nice and we are back from our break this is off pokemon.com a pokemon sword and shield global challenge winter features powerful legendary pokemon it will take place because the pokemon company likes to plan everything on the same weekend it will take place between february 25th through the 28th why i don't it's like the worst timing ever would you do this we're going to be watching a post malone concert yeah trying to get busy trying to get hip with the popular music i'm i'm busy being a malone head what are they called maloneys [Laughter] the rules for the tournament will will take place with series eight rules so there's nothing special or fun about this competition you're allowed to use one restricted pokemon so mewtwo lugia ho oh no one's using mewtwo uh kyogre groudon rayquaza dialga palkia guartina reshram zach no one's using zekrom kirum zernius evital zygarde zagar players are the worst cosmog cosmon no one's using those two so galileo uh lunala necrozma zashian zamazenta no one's using eternitis or and or calorics can be on your team or calorics not and you can only use one of these it's a casual competition so no champion points are on the line i believe you only get 50 battle points for participating no shirt no ball gas shirts i was just gonna say which ball guys shirt do i get but i guess i don't get any until there's a luxury ball guys shirt i'm just i'm this game is incomplete so that is the global winter challenge 2021 again it'll take place february 25th to 28th if you want your 50 battle points you just have to do one battle doesn't matter whether you win or lose you get your 50 battle points for participating the other news and this was sent by brandon from our slack community is that we are we're recording this on february 18th we're only 18 days into series eight series eight goes for three months we are 18 days in and the pokemon company announced that series nine will go back to the rules of series seven why and that will begin on may 1st why did they go back i don't know yeah maybe it was a better time it was they just realized so they're still like a qualifier for so they haven't sent out the invites for players cup three but they will send it out probably before may 1st and there's a top cut that needs to take place this is my only thought process so so the thinking is they wanted series 8 to be featured in players cup 3 for the streams that they do and then they'll change it which is fine because that's what happened with players cup two you started in series five and then when you participated it was series six so that's fine i don't understand two things one why announces so early like we're not even into a full month of this rule set and you're like hey we got two more months of this but also we're gonna go back on it and it's fine to remove the legends why just go directly back to series seven and not do like okay we're going series seven but we're going to ban five pokemon or we're doing series seven but or we're doing well i guess what people wanted from what i saw is people wanted series eight but instead of two restricted you would have instead of one restricted you have two restricted which is what the rule set was for the ultra cup in ultra sun ultra moon but we're literally just going back to series seven which was everything but these one restricteds that's when hershey foo was on top and tapu finney was on top are they unhappy with the amount of people participating in the ranked ladder where they're like oh no no one likes this let's go back maybe but it also like why would you announce it now because i feel like for me i just don't even want to build a team anymore why because it's gonna just be the same old team that you had before yeah because it will go back so i had a bunch of teams for series seven that i really liked and right now i'm like struggling to find something i do like in series eight and so i could i could keep going to between different teams and that's totally fine like competitive pokemon players are used to changing your teams and changing your real sets but also like i could just plan for more teams for series seven of like oh this these are unfinished thoughts i had for series seven now i can finish working on them yeah but wait all right this is where i'm perplexed and confused series eight is a casual tournament right series eight is the current ranked rules on the left oh dagnabbit okay and the winter challenge is also using series eight and we series eight defines a concept of the way that you battle but it's not the actual battle tournament itself correct okay yes that is it's like in the tcg they released a new set of cards and you're like i got all these things to work with but in three months they're going to release a new set of cards but in this instance they're like we're just taking away the last set we gave you and we're going back to the set before yeah it is weird because it's not a step forward but i get very yeah i maybe it's just they they realize that series 8 was super flawed or i think they can realize that though in like two weeks i mean they can see the meta evolve that quickly sure or maybe they started developing series nine or got sufficiently far down the road for developing what they were thinking for series nine and then realized like somebody came running in the room at the last minute and said hey wait a minute we found this one thing remember because of the thing that we're doing on february 29th and they're like oh that's right and then it's like oh series nine can't happen i guess they could yeah we do we can't keep series eight people we're gonna get bored of that all right well let's go back to series seven people like series seven i mean i guess they could just they could also just change series nine and say well we were gonna do series seven but now it's gonna be series seven plus a brand new pokemon we're showing on saturday there you go [Music] i don't know it seems a little weird it just seems weird that they announced it i don't think it would seem as weird if they announced it like two weeks before it was going to be series nine when they announced series seven we didn't hear about the series eight rules until a week before series 8 started yeah yeah that's weird but they got a lot going on they got a concert plan maybe they wanted to just get ahead of it and say look we're going to be doing this two steps forward one step back thing for a while so speaking of two steps forward this is pokemon.com pokemon unite development update and regional beta test in canada for android users canadian residents can go hands-on with the upcoming game yeah since the first reveal of pokemon unite nearly a year ago development has continued progress more playable pokemon have been added uh challenges and additions have been made to gameplay and visuals have improved and much more how can you make improvements on the game that we haven't even gotten yet and why does canada get all the good stuff first i have a theory that said there is still plenty to be done to ensure the best possible experience now the developers are looking for pokemon fans to help deliver that experience by participating in a regional beta test in canada we've talked about this before but it's been in beta for quite a while in china uh this march players in canada will have their first opportunity to play pokemon unite i'm just going to stop here because all week i've been hearing that they're gonna shadow drop unite on the 27th or whatever's pokemon day nope nah if you just go to pokemon.com those rumors are very much squashed they are going to shadow drop pokemon sleep this march players in canada will have their first opportunity to play pokemon unite while the game is planned for release for apple and android devices and the nintendo switch this beta will be limited to android devices interested trainers can visit the unite page this is you can do this right off pokemon.com in the google play store for details the unite regional beta test is open to only residents of canada you must be 16 years old or older your in-game progress will will reset when the beta is over capturing or streaming gameplay is not allowed during the beta and and that's pretty much it i would assume on pokemon day we maybe get a time frame for this game whether it's going to be like a summer release or a spring release or that's reasonable 2022 release but i don't see them saying hey canada you'll be able to test it in march and then somehow release the game before that that doesn't make sense but but honestly if they are ready to test the game in united states light then that means that they're pretty close in to releasing it in the united states regular if yeah maybe if listeners don't remember pokemon go was in australia early i know the australians get all the good stuff first yeah but this is my theory 12 hours before us my theory is that mobas are some of the most toxic player moba players are some of the most toxic players on the internet so the pokemon company looks to the nicest players on the internet which is canada where they apologize every time they oh sorry there a didn't mean to take your lane that was my best canadian impression wow hey i mean you could have done that i put the open i put the a that's all you need they don't do oh that's a minnesotan thing maybe they're like very northern maybe they're you know quebec that's not on the border of minnesota you are correct quebec is not on the border of minnesota can we talk about your offensive nerd stereotype when you put your glasses on that what what do you mean that is my actual person that's actually me that's the real me the voice i'm doing right now is the persona the truth is out opportunist you don't like my nerd voice no it's offensive to nerds everywhere correct but i'm a nerd well i've been hosting my little job is hosting a pokemon podcast it actually cannot be any nerdier than that nerds don't have gauges sorry bro oh that's true do you think they wear chain wallets i used to wear one of those nerds don't wear super no but listen here edge lord you get into your high school i'm too cool for these nerds thing you put in your glasses and we're all like get back to hot topic loser oh boy there's a lot of name calling this episode you want to see a real nerd let me show you some pictures of me in high school oh yeah well you know i found did we will what was the nationals we met at was that the one where it was black and white right yes and i found 12. i found pictures of me and irene and nick standing next to a giant oshawa and boy did i look like a nerd [Music] i looked really bad in those pictures i mean as far as i know you haven't changed a wit in no nine years here's the thing is in what's happened between is you have two powerful friends who will look at your hair and go that's what you're choosing to do today like this is the choices you're making okay you know you're on screen trying to entertain people not frightened children no i want they don't have money i want i don't want them watching my stream was that i think that was uh oh no that was i was like is the unite our last bit of news here i'm excited for you tonight i'm i'm genuinely excited for that i'm on there some pokemon related arrests this week [Music] has wisconsin been sleeping on the job i don't think any we we did we did have like three weeks of pokemon everybody in florida has to have been arrested right for pokemon something let's look at florida man pokemon i'm sure i'm sure somebody's gotten arrested i will say for the mcdonald's debacle the most expensive card last time we reported was the pikachu card the hollow pikachu is going for 80. it's been a week over a week hollow pikachu only going for forty dollars now it's dropped half its price enough oh you gotta sell you gotta sell now uh i would expect as the as we go another week it will drop even more did you see that people bought all the levi's stuff into scalping those no two uh when i looked the the garden jeans were available the jeans were like 180 dollars and they're not even that's why i didn't get them because they were not 501s yeah if i'm gonna pay over a hundred dollars for a pair of jeans i need i need that to be fresh off the the weaving machine there is no way there's no way with the treatment on those pants in the forest style that those are raw denim straight like that no no that could that could i mean it just wouldn't be rope dyed so so the oh you you keep in mind when we talk about like the superior denims number one it's the dying process right so you want rope dyed obviously they cannot do rope dyed if there's a printed pattern right on the genes number two you want them to use a rigid headed loom and then number three is the self edge which is the type of the way that they kind of finish the edges of the gene uh so you could have two and three who's the nerd now okay let me let me give you the the als the cliff notes here most jeans at a store are washed multiple times my jeans are clean well no no no they're washed be it's different wash they're still clean right but that's when you first wash a pair of raw denim you're going to get a ton of dye out of them whereas if you wash a pair of like levi's from coals it's not it's not gonna like dye your washing machine blue but but i mean the main concept of dyeing raw denim jeans is that they use a rope dyeing process which primarily dyes the outside of the fiber and does not reach to the inside of the fiber that's why you get sick fades with raw denim jeans where in a tradition or current modern dyeing process it does die the fiber completely through so you're not going to get the same kind of fades as you do with raw denim that levi stuff was really overpriced the pokemon tax was high well it's the levi's tax and the book monday you had two taxes going in that was never going to be cheap and it was also not available at the levi's store at the mall of america i checked because you know i hate to buy stuff off the internet hey how was how busy was the mall america when you went when which time yeah it was there was it was me and greg it was not not particularly busy it wasn't that busy all right we we easily got parking right next to each other you parked in the past no no we parked in hawaii dude park in hawaii yeah so because you could park in hawaii normally you have to go because nevada's the fifth level i mean i'm always in the valley usually one through four is pretty packed but when we were there last there was space in one and two so we got to choose hawaii yes and we were able to park next to each other which really tells you that there were enough spaces available that there were two spaces thanks to each other near the walkway to get to the entrance we like walked outside in sub-zero temperature for like a minute at best all right some other news here is it's kind of an ad i guess because i was sent well it ultimately is an ad because i was sent the glasses and i got to talk about them uh jyn's eyewear has released pokemon glasses uh that represent both the kanto and the johto regions they did send me a pair i've posted a picture of myself on instagram and twitter you probably saw it if you follow on social this is off hypebeast.com uh jyn's released a 52-piece eyewear collection with pokemon it's broken into four categories flagship kanto region jojo region and kids the flagship model includes four frames of the popular pocket monster characters pikachu snorlax evmu they asked me which kind i wanted i picked this my wife picked the snorlax because she said the snorlax ones are the best she said i look good in them uh these glasses come in a uh leather pouch with a long which with a large pokeball cleaning cloth you can see that in my pictures uh the kanto region frames focus on the original 151 and um mainly the four starter pokemon given by professor oak pikachu bulbasaur charmander squirtle uh each canto theme comes with a um the kanto themed ones the pikachu bubbles for squirtle charmander ones come with a hard case uh and then the other ones which are the pikachu snorlax evmu they come with that leather case the johto frames uh are focused on ho oh lugia and chikorita syndical and totodile and the kids release uh features i believe they're just pikachu and eevee they don't say on this article but i'm almost positive it's pikachu eevee the kids also comes with a rotom phone case they're priced between 100 to 140 dollars they can be found over at gins i have a direct link i also have a discount code which is pkmncass you can save 15 off your order that's the ad part of this but i like the glasses i don't wear glasses it's funny how many people are like wow steve i've never seen you in glasses before yes because i don't wear glasses but don't you have a prescription for glasses i don't know i've never done i've never needed glasses i don't have contacts i was born with perfect vision will i mean we were all born with persecution um jen's does offer like a blue light i know some people really really i think you like the blue light right greg yeah it stopped me from getting headaches because i work in front of a bright computer all day um so i got the blue light on mine uh and then when i asked people because again i've never purchased a pair of glasses i was like is is 140 a lot for a pair of glasses and everyone i talked to said it that was a great price and they were super super 40 is actually a great price the black glasses that you traditionally see me wearing with the thick black frames were four hundred dollars yeah jeez and they're not even snorlax my glasses i mean again the the the frames aren't the expensive part for me is the lenses i usually buy around a 200 frame so they're they're a little less than what i normally play but then you know they get close to a thousand dollars when they have to add in my prescription and the bifocal and all and all the things my biggest problem with gins is i tried on all their glasses and i looked terrible in all of them what are you impossible a lot of the pokemon ones are round and i have a very round face oh you got to go to the kanto ones they're more sweet yeah but i don't like uh the kanto ones were okay but they were a little small because i also have a big face i have a big head where are you trying these on you can have a virtual triangle so it's not 100 true also i don't need new glasses but if jen's is still going on when i have my next eye appointment because i usually have to get glasses every two years because my eyes deteriorate because i'm old same i might consider getting those but i want to be able to try on the frames actually in person yes physical locations i don't think so but i'm wondering if i can be like can you send me frames they do have a they do have i i did check some because somebody asked about the return policy um they do have like a 30 day like no questions asked return policy as long as it's not with a prescription once yeah once you add a prescription to it then you can't return it so i probably would want to like get frames that i think would look good on my face try them on and then see if they are good if they are send those back and say okay here's my full prescription because my prescription is pretty bad but overall there's a lot of cute glasses there's just a lot of roundy glasses because that's more in style again i do like the johto glasses like that cyndaquil model yeah i was just surprised the pokemon tax wasn't like uh yeah the levi attacks the pokemon levi's those things were out of my budget for sure i don't know i was hoping to get something more athletic the next time i got glasses but boy oh boy yeah you see how all the jojo ones are so roundy the only ones that i think look that could look good is the kanto region model yeah i wish they had a uh wait they don't have a johto region model no even though it says johto region model that's so weird and like the snorlax classes are also very they're all very rounded they i do much better with a flat sort of flatter top yeah what i would like to get is pretty much exactly what i currently have just with pokemon on it yeah [Laughter] if you have any questions about them though you can always message me on twitter or instagram and i can try to answer them but yeah i have the discount code if you are interested fifteen dollars off just pkmencast at checkout link will be in the podcast notes but there's your full disclosure ad hashtag ad free product [Laughter] um let's jump to question of the week as that wraps it up for our pokemon news ooh what's the question of the week ooh what's the question of the week this is from the week is what song was that this is from al we all know al i don't have to say like alfred with a week of pokemon announcements upcoming what is the one thing you are pretty confident won't happen obviously there should be limited things that are being uh thrown about as suggestions not like pokemon being sold to apple i don't think they're announcing a new gen yeah are people do people really think that yeah some reason my brain just went to a whole other planet while you were talking well me because i didn't do it in a scottish accent uh with a week of pokemon announcements coming what is one thing you're pretty confident will not happen uh a week of pokemon announcements they will announce everything at the end of the day those were their words they did say we're gonna have week-long announcements what is not going to be announced i mean a pokemon burger king collaboration that's pretty clear i uh uh yeah i get i why would they announce gen 9 that would be yeah i mean where we're we're early for it but that doesn't people people saying oh certain shields are already so it's been out for so long they're going to do the next gen or they're going to announce the next gen that's coming in two years or whatever they they announced uh pokemon x and y in either february or march um that's true and then that came out in october that is true i wouldn't say it's early for that announcement to come out i would i mean like i guess i could see the thought process of like they announced and released sun and moon during the 20th anniversary this is a pretty big deal it's 25. i guess i could kind of follow the logic this is the 15th anniversary of diamond and pearl so i feel like the obvious and what everyone wants is diamond and pro remakes yeah i i have i i will say that i'm fairly confident they will announce those remakes i might alternate that to say that they will do a platinum remake and not have it be two games no there's no way they don't do two games they're not gonna they're not gonna skip on that money uh ever since like they well i mean they did emerald they did crystal they did platinum but then they also just straight up did ultrasound ultramoon which is the same game true true feel like we're always going to be living in a two-game world uh i'm confident they're not gonna do dlc i'd for sword and shield in the center like i should i should i should put an asterisk of paid dlc i could see them adding like a free update to everyone or maybe i just want a free update to everyone of like what are they gonna update you know add following pokemon to the original wild area what if they do three games yeah i'm waiting for the day for them to do this i really believe that's in the future i just don't see how you sell more dlc after you've already done dlc with 40 some legendary pokemon yeah i don't i don't think there's more dlc the game is missing 260 pokemon but the first two dlcs only added a hundred pokemon each so even if they did two more dlcs there's they're still technically 60 pokemon short i guess you could say like okay both these dlcs have 130 and 130 and now we have them all i just don't see how you go like man in this dlc you can catch lugia you can catch oh you can catch necrozma and they're like this new dlc you can catch beedrill and clam pearl it's just not it's it's very hard to follow up like 40 legends with kind of a bunch of reject pokemon at this point i'm sorry to like the one person that like loves bee drill and has a b drill tattoo but i don't think beedrill and like clam pearl are like strong enough you could maybe make the argument that that greninja would would maybe move some copies people do really like greninja a whole lot this is true yeah i would love to be wrong on that though like like if they i like i'm not done with sword and shield i love sword and shield i like it a whole lot so i mean i i still don't think that they're going to add a dlc that is cinna remakes to sword and shield oh i don't think that that that definitely ain't happening if they're putting out a region they're charging 60 bucks for it absolutely they're gonna make a new game for that one yeah i don't think there's more dlc for sword and shield i think most likely there's going to be the remakes coming out and then next year they announce what the gen 9 game is yeah yeah or we're not getting remakes and they just announced a new game i don't think if they re what what do you think you're pretty confident it won't happen i'm pretty confident that if it is a remake dynamaxx will be in it they're going to carry that through until gennady well yeah i mean they did the same thing with megas yeah i don't see how they cut dynomax no i mean not not for this universe right no yeah yeah they will eventually cut dynamax because they will move on to the next gimmick and i don't know why pokemon fans can't wrap their head around this like mario games and zelda games have been doing it for years like in this mario game he has a water pack they took it away in this mario game he goes to space they took that away and this mario game has a cat suit it's because we want pokemon to be better than that word and we're continually proven wrong do you i okay i also don't think they're gonna i don't think they're gonna show any new pokemon like oh no this is not the time for new pokemons i don't know they kind of drop melton out of nowhere that was also not the time for new pokemon [Music] [Laughter] i'm confident there probably won't be a new mobile game we have we have sleep we have unite sleep doesn't exist well you're right but i like i'm confident there won't be some random new pokemon game out of nowhere i think we got sleep we got unite we got masters we got go but that being said i want to be wrong on that too i would i'm not gonna say no to like shuffle three [Laughter] i don't think we hear anything about detective pikachu two the movie um the game yes but i don't think i don't think they're ready i because i don't think they're ready for a movie at all even though there was rumors that they signed for a sequel i mean that's fine it still takes years to make a movie especially in this day and age i talk about the the one thing i want that will probably not happen yeah a brand new tcgo client no that would not yeah that's true that won't happen that's that's never going to happen that's the thing i want the most pokemon tcg on the iphone not just the ipad i want that too but i i need a whole new client i need something to work they knew how much money that they would make if they would just port the tcg to the iphone man i have played card games on my iphone it's a terrible experience and yet i've still done it would probably also help if it was on switch that too uh pokemon of the week last week's pokemon i uh the difficulty level was set by the fact that it referenced a pokemon well first it talked about valentine's day which literally had next to nothing to do with the entire pokemon except i reference valentines which are kind of like letters but also difficulty level set by the fact that it referenced the pokemon that you only encounter in the post game of black and white so if you didn't get to the post game or you didn't do the post game like after defeating gets this the first time uh yeah you're not gonna know you're not gonna know what i was talking about but we had a pokemon who lost three grams and that scrams with a capital g because it's a held item and then you have to return them to that pokemon you can't then catch that pokemon but it does give you tm 89 which is u-turn as it flies away and then i also reference the fact that the pokemon's evolution is the mail carrier in pokemon mystery dungeon rescue team so which chat is it it's joe duo it's wingo thank you yeah doduo doesn't fly as far as it doesn't even have wings i mean it does learn fly it does learn fly dang probably the best pokemon shuffle icon it is so good wingle is an adorable often forgotten little sweetie of a pokemon no all of us are pico stans i do like pico's probably the best part about uh ruby sapphire well who's better than pico red gyarados wait is that in ruby and sapphire yeah you're thinking of the wrong game dag which is the one where they blow up the lake and then all the magikarps are like flopping around in there i mean that's a different game too that's diamond pearl wow i told you i'm i'm a whole other universe right now you guys have got me at the wrong pokemon best part of diamond and pearl though when they blow up the lincoln there's magikarp everywhere yeah now if they could have only blown up mount cornet it would have been a better game yeah it's like a good green it's one of the good green ones it's one of the good greens well only part of it is green right right yeah the blue turns it green yeah but then the rest stays white so it's still special do you have any wiggle trivia no it's just like wingle has the same speed and does not it's not very exciting winkle has the exact same base stats as taylor except for their attack and special attacker swapped i think that's important all right here we go sure this week's pokemon of the week that's going to be at jeopardy which pokemon does wingle swap stay anyway uh pikachu all right this week's pokemon of the week i am completely discombobulated someone on discord asked me to do this one it's another mythical from alola but not zeraora it was featured in a movie it takes no damage from normal or fighting type moves i used to be scared of the creature it is based on when i was camping as a cub scout there that's all the clues that you need boy did you write this or was this written to you by somebody else and you're reading it no i wrote this okay i just forgot to do pokemon of the week until three minutes before we started recording so i was like let me at least come up with six sentences that refer to a pokemon i i got it the answer is chat yeah spoilers well that's our episode hopefully you had a good canto tour fest i think it's called canto tour uh hopefully pokemon week will be good to you hopefully uh pikachu will bring you all the things that you ever wanted this week uh hopefully the scalpers didn't scalp the things that you wanted for yourself good luck finding and it turns out that pikachu was the scalper and then he gave everything out to all the good boys and girls as as gifts no he didn't no i know good luck finding shining fates i'm sure it will be sold out oh i know somebody who got two etbs i saw it on snapchat i'll be once i get back from minnesota uh on sunday night i'll be streaming on twitch uh pretty much all week i believe i will be streaming the post malone concert but i will be streaming in a way where you won't hear the audio and you won't see the video so you pull it up on your screen i'll have it muted uh on my screen because i do not want to be dmcad but i want to give you my thoughts as it is going live i do not trust anything music related on twitch uh but i think watching that concert with an audience will be more fun than sitting in my underwear watching it by myself [Music] as of this recording we don't know if there will actually be like a pokemon direct um i think that's what everyone just assumes is going to happen i'm sure there will be one uh but as of this recording on tuesday and thursday february 18th at nine o'clock at night there is no pokemon direct announced but um if there is one obviously we'll get that news communicated on twitter and in the discord and the slack and all that stuff so um and we'll cover that of course when that comes out but uh happy 25 to pokemon we will see you guys next week if you want to follow
