deal I'm starting a new podcast it's (1:10 - 1:14)
about looks around the room (1:12 - 1:17)
keyboards alright I don't think that (1:14 - 1:19)
markets been taken I think you could (1:17 - 1:23)
dominate that market it's the it's the (1:19 - 1:26)
Moog cast like moogles luka cast Moog (1:23 - 1:29)
it's a famous brand of keyboard chord oh (1:26 - 1:31)

you're thinking the instrument I was (1:31 - 1:36)
doing a joke about looking at what's in (1:33 - 1:39)
front of me in a computer keyboard mmm (1:36 - 1:42)
podcast will you say a random ambiguous (1:39 - 1:44)
word and then find out what people (1:42 - 1:46)
actually thought you were talking about (1:44 - 1:50)
we got a show we got a show for you guys (1:46 - 1:53)
today we've spoken my news regarding the (1:50 - 1:56)
mostly Pokemon go but we have some recap (1:53 - 2:03)
of the VGC and the TCG us international (1:56 - 2:06)
championships I don't I think that's (2:03 - 2:08)
what they call it now something like (2:06 - 2:09)
that and then we have some emails and (2:08 - 2:12)
our Pokemon of the week so that's gonna (2:09 - 2:15)
be our show there was quite a bunch of (2:12 - 2:19)
Twitter and slack replies regarding to (2:15 - 2:21)
the lieutenant surge thing this (2:19 - 2:25)
consensus seems to be that one of the (2:21 - 2:31)
NPC's in the gym tells you that the (2:25 - 2:34)
second switch is always next to the (2:31 - 2:37)
switch that's incorrect the consensus is (2:34 - 2:39)
jackiebrown is actually quentin (2:37 - 2:42)
tarantino's best film but we all agree (2:39 - 2:45)
with Travis that Quentin Tarantino is an (2:42 - 2:47)
overrated director I've kind of (2:45 - 2:48)
forgotten about Jackie Brown when I was (2:47 - 2:50)
saying what ones I like because it's so (2:48 - 2:52)
not Tarantino (2:50 - 2:53)
there you go the exception that proves (2:52 - 2:57)
the rule I like Jackie Brown good let's (2:53 - 3:01)
jump into some Pokemon news first bit of (2:57 - 3:05)
news here is off Bulbul pedia mu movie (3:01 - 3:07)

7-eleven in Japan zero codes to attain (3:07 - 3:12)
Mew and three Pokemon owned by the (3:10 - 3:15)
trainers from Pokemon the movie 2000 I (3:12 - 3:17)
choose you are available at 7-eleven (3:15 - 3:19)
source in Japan currently these codes (3:17 - 3:21)
can be redeemed in Pokemon Sun and Moon (3:19 - 3:23)
this mean will be level 50 and the (3:21 - 3:27)
original trainer will be xx star you can (3:23 - 3:29)
also get ash's charizard at level 42 (3:27 - 3:34)
juries Lucario at level 40 and Mikado's (3:29 - 3:37)
Piplup at level 30 I wonder if that's (3:34 - 3:39)
spoiler for the movie if we're gonna see (3:37 - 3:41)
you carry on Piplup I think they were in (3:39 - 3:43)
the trailer okay to obtain these codes (3:41 - 3:45)
players need to go to the 7-eleven store (3:43 - 3:47)
collect the virtual stamps using seven (3:45 - 3:49)
spots in the respective events durations (3:47 - 3:51)
players can obtain one stamp per store (3:49 - 3:56)
per day from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. if a (3:51 - 3:57)
player has two stamps they can obtain a (3:56 - 4:01)
code for a pok√©mon each serial code (3:57 - 4:02)
requires a player to collect two stamps (4:01 - 4:05)
so they will need eight stamps to obtain (4:02 - 4:08)
all four Pokemon and in other news you (4:05 - 4:11)
get Soylent at 7-eleven in California (4:08 - 4:13)

thing I just don't I don't have anything (4:13 - 4:20)
to say you can buy a grey paste that (4:16 - 4:23)
tastes like nothing and like in Sep this (4:20 - 4:25)
the most but I can't imagine a more (4:23 - 4:27)
boring statement I don't know how to (4:25 - 4:31)
make this funny I'm sorry (4:27 - 4:31)

hard to believe that Pokemon go launched (4:37 - 4:41)

this August and September in Europe and (6:09 - 6:14)
Pokemon go events at the Pikachu (6:12 - 6:17)
outbreak in Yokohama Japan this August (6:14 - 6:20)
sincerely the Pokemon go team ah so (6:17 - 6:22)
there's a bit of news to go with this (6:20 - 6:26)
but the ash hat Pikachu I think is a (6:22 - 6:28)
nice touch yeah I haven't seen any of (6:26 - 6:31)
those I saw your drama about the (6:28 - 6:34)
whatever it was like the shadow or (6:31 - 6:36)
whatever and the then it turned out to (6:34 - 6:38)
be an asshat Pikachu or a Pikachu (6:36 - 6:40)
wearing an ash hat something yeah but (6:38 - 6:44)
several hours later well you saw I (6:40 - 6:46)
retreated the Pokemon go account where (6:44 - 6:48)
they said they were having problems with (6:46 - 6:50)
launching their event yeah i retweeted (6:48 - 6:53)
that too so the Pikachu hat the hat (6:50 - 6:55)
Pikachu should have went live at 3 p.m. (6:53 - 6:58)
Central Time so when I so when they (6:55 - 7:01)
tweeted that it was I think around 4 (6:58 - 7:01)
p.m. Central (7:01 - 7:03)
time that hey we're having issues with (7:01 - 7:06)
ash hat Pikachu so I didn't leave work (7:03 - 7:09)
until 6 and I can see three gyms for my (7:06 - 7:12)
work and one of them had an open spot (7:09 - 7:16)
for mystic so I left work to go to that (7:12 - 7:18)
gym it's like 6 o'clock so I go over to (7:16 - 7:20)
the gym I put a Pokemon there and then I (7:18 - 7:22)
pull from that gym I can see another for (7:20 - 7:23)
more gyms (7:22 - 7:26)
so I pulled up my so I looked around to (7:23 - 7:28)
see if there was any more gyms I'm to (7:26 - 7:30)
the point now where I don't care too (7:28 - 7:32)
much about battling like I like it I (7:30 - 7:33)
think it's better than the old gym (7:32 - 7:36)
system but I'm not gonna sit there solo (7:33 - 7:39)
and battle 6 Pokemon just to put one (7:36 - 7:41)
Pokemon there like if I'm gonna battle (7:39 - 7:43)
at a gym that helped Pokemon go works (7:41 - 7:44)
though you're like oh there's a there's (7:43 - 7:46)
a gym next to me where I can put a (7:44 - 7:48)
Pokemon and then you do it and by the (7:46 - 7:50)
time you get there then you see the 12 (7:48 - 7:52)
other pokey stops that no I'll just go (7:50 - 7:54)
there they're just a block away oh yeah (7:52 - 7:56)
and you get there you realize oh there's (7:54 - 7:58)
like 20 gyms just around the corner and (7:56 - 8:00)
all of a sudden you're in like you're in (7:58 - 8:04)
like you're in like two towns over yeah (8:00 - 8:05)
that's that's totally accurate and (8:04 - 8:08)
happens to me quite frequently I when I (8:05 - 8:10)
was looking at the other gyms to see if (8:08 - 8:13)
their response back at my work I saw the (8:10 - 8:15)
silhouette of Pikachu and I already have (8:13 - 8:18)
Pikachu I have a lot of Pokemon if you (8:15 - 8:21)
play pokemon go and you see a silhouette (8:18 - 8:23)
that means you don't have it so I was (8:21 - 8:26)
assuming oh that must be Ash hat Pikachu (8:23 - 8:29)
since I have Pichu I have Pichu I have (8:26 - 8:31)
right you so I drove back over to my (8:29 - 8:33)
work and I encountered it and it was (8:31 - 8:37)
just a regular Pikachu and I thought to (8:33 - 8:38)
myself that's a bummer (8:37 - 8:41)
and that also doesn't make sense of why (8:38 - 8:43)
it was a silhouette and some people on (8:41 - 8:45)
Twitter was like oh well maybe it was a (8:43 - 8:47)
Ditto but that doesn't Nelson that (8:45 - 8:49)
doesn't make sense one because ditto is (8:47 - 8:53)
usually riot at or Pidgey and - I have (8:49 - 8:55)
ditto so that still doesn't make sense (8:53 - 8:58)
so I said I caught the Pikachu and went (8:55 - 8:59)
on my way because why would I not catch (8:58 - 9:01)
a Pikachu they want you to catch like (8:59 - 9:02)
200 Pikachu's or something for that (9:01 - 9:05)
Pikachu catch her mettle so I went home (9:02 - 9:08)
and then I checked the stats of the (9:05 - 9:09)
Pikachu just because I was looking to (9:08 - 9:11)
see if it was breathtaking or not and it (9:09 - 9:14)
wasn't then Micha texted me (9:11 - 9:16)
later that night he texted me around 10 (9:14 - 9:18)
p.m. and said hey I haven't caught any (9:16 - 9:21)
asshat pikachu's you want to go out (9:18 - 9:23)
tonight I said sure and I looked at I (9:21 - 9:26)
went through that is so romantic (9:23 - 9:29)
Wow I wish a guy would ask me out like (9:26 - 9:32)
that so it was a beautiful text message (9:29 - 9:34)
conversation I went back through my (9:32 - 9:36)
Pokemon and I noticed that that Pikachu (9:34 - 9:38)
I caught earlier became an asshat eat (9:36 - 9:41)
you so everything was right in the world (9:38 - 9:42)
and then we went out and we caught more (9:41 - 9:45)
ash happy juice so the thing here that I (9:42 - 9:49)
did notice and I could be wrong I'm not (9:45 - 9:51)
wrong often as we've learned from this (9:49 - 9:54)
podcast but I remember during the (9:51 - 9:56)
santahat Pikachu and the birthday had (9:54 - 9:59)
Pichu that there was a possibility that (9:56 - 10:02)
not all Pikachu's had hats from what I (9:59 - 10:06)
remember for Ash hat Pikachu ah it's the (10:02 - 10:09)
opposite I haven't found a Pikachu (10:06 - 10:11)
without a half so I don't know if that's (10:09 - 10:13)
true enough I haven't seen any Pikachu's (10:11 - 10:14)
here at all (10:13 - 10:17)
the current Washington DC nearby report (10:14 - 10:22)
is a murkrow sunkern real excited for (10:17 - 10:24)
that one more sun curtain to get (10:22 - 10:27)
sunflora it's been a rack magic cart (10:24 - 10:32)
spinarak murkrow hoot-hoot and summoner (10:27 - 10:34)
and come visit me so you got we got (10:32 - 10:36)
sunkern out the wazoo running out there (10:34 - 10:39)
to get those I'm also like 50 candies (10:36 - 10:41)
away from Gyarados oh yeah I got (10:39 - 10:44)
mountains all over the place here and (10:41 - 10:45)
there's Matt always Magikarp in the (10:44 - 10:48)
fountains one of the gyms that I can see (10:45 - 10:51)
from my house has a Magikarp as the one (10:48 - 10:53)
that's on top of the gym whatever title (10:51 - 10:56)
you go that's fun it's at the children's (10:53 - 10:59)
playground that's cool it's sort of like (10:56 - 11:01)
a Magikarp jump crossover I can I can (10:59 - 11:04)
get behind that there was a and then (11:01 - 11:06)
there there's three raids going on (11:04 - 11:09)
around me right now I would love if at (11:06 - 11:12)
my house I could see gyms going on but I (11:09 - 11:14)
can't (11:12 - 11:17)
hey man that is so cool was I have a (11:14 - 11:19)
better story it's not really that great (11:17 - 11:23)
of a story I went to my local mall there (11:19 - 11:27)
was not only a mr. mime in the gym which (11:23 - 11:30)
is exclusive to Europe but there was (11:27 - 11:32)
also a king scan in the gym which is (11:30 - 11:35)
exclusive towards Australia and I (11:32 - 11:36)
thought that was kind of cool (11:35 - 11:38)
I mean I've also seen gyms where all the (11:36 - 11:40)
gyms are different Eevee's and I've seen (11:38 - 11:43)
gyms where it's nothing but birds I saw (11:40 - 11:45)
a gym that was like a Noctowl and as a (11:43 - 11:47)
two and a Pidgey so I think that's fun (11:45 - 11:51)
because it's a sky battle gym I think (11:47 - 11:54)
that's that's fun because if you really (11:51 - 11:56)
wanted to take out a gym it doesn't (11:54 - 11:59)
matter what the CP values in the gym are (11:56 - 12:05)
whether it's the gym is 1500 CP or 2,800 (11:59 - 12:10)
CP it's still doable just solo that gym (12:05 - 12:13)
if you're if you're around like level 20 (12:10 - 12:14)
25 26 (12:13 - 12:16)
you can still solo the gym it might take (12:14 - 12:18)
you a while and you might go through a (12:16 - 12:20)
lot of potions and revise to do it but (12:18 - 12:22)
it's still obtainable so I do think it's (12:20 - 12:25)
fun that people are putting unique not (12:22 - 12:27)
unique but different Pokemon it's not (12:25 - 12:30)
every gym as Chauncey Snorlax Gyarados (12:27 - 12:34)
ride on I mean you do still see some of (12:30 - 12:36)
that but it is really fun I think to see (12:34 - 12:38)
oh look cool mr. mime is in this gym or (12:36 - 12:40)
Ampharos is in this gym I haven't seen (12:38 - 12:43)
Ampharos yet or kangaskhan or something (12:40 - 12:43)
like that (12:43 - 12:45)
so the West Michigan middle of no (12:43 - 12:47)
airport the nearby (12:45 - 12:50)
you got a Spiro Yetta loop something (12:47 - 12:52)
else just popped up a Spiro Alethia a (12:50 - 12:55)
merrill and then just a picture where (12:52 - 12:57)
the model hasn't loaded in Oh a knitter (12:55 - 13:01)
am male or female male yeah I got I got (12:57 - 13:03)
in a door and mail every day on my walk (13:01 - 13:06)
iris have we talked on the show like (13:03 - 13:08)
what does a knitter an supposed to be (13:06 - 13:11)
huh like is it not like a rabbit yeah (13:08 - 13:14)
but then like what it but then what are (13:11 - 13:16)
like knit Oh king and queen then cuz (13:14 - 13:19)
like big rabbit they sure aren't bunnies (13:16 - 13:22)
where is there they're like rabbits that (13:19 - 13:25)
turn into dinosaurs I don't get it is (13:22 - 13:27)
there a creature in withou (13:25 - 13:30)
mythology because you know how horses (13:27 - 13:32)
have horns and then their unicorns and (13:30 - 13:35)
whales have horns and then their NAR (13:32 - 13:38)
whales you're asking if knitter an is a (13:35 - 13:41)
Jackalope oh yeah but I don't is that (13:38 - 13:44)
that could be right no I don't think (13:41 - 13:45)
it's a Jackalope because Jackalope (13:44 - 13:48)
aren't Jackalopes a very uniquely like a (13:45 - 13:52)
North American mythical creature yes I (13:48 - 13:55)
want a Jackalope Pokemon now I'm gonna (13:52 - 13:58)
pull up Bobo pedia here I already did (13:55 - 14:01)
ain't nothing there no answers it's a (13:58 - 14:04)
mix of a porcupine a rabbit Mouse and (14:01 - 14:06)
hamster that's a real stretch right (14:04 - 14:09)
there quite an amalgam toss that all in (14:06 - 14:12)
the blender you get those white boys a (14:09 - 14:14)
knife it's just like you mix that number (14:12 - 14:16)
of things together you're probably gonna (14:14 - 14:19)
get something gross Burnie no King it (14:16 - 14:21)
says that neato King shares traits with (14:19 - 14:23)
a rhinoceros a gorilla a rabbit and a (14:21 - 14:24)
porcupine (14:23 - 14:26)
where's the gorilla in that mix maybe (14:24 - 14:28)
the arms it's like broad shoulders I (14:26 - 14:31)
think that's much of a stretch well that (14:28 - 14:33)

monitors and each will be accompanied by (15:08 - 15:13)
a team gym a site where players can (15:10 - 15:16)
compete against other pokemon the (15:13 - 15:19)
Petrillo music shell will serve as an (15:16 - 15:21)
invent main stage and will feature (15:19 - 15:25)
unquote ultimate gym we'd stop there and (15:21 - 15:27)
say this is this is where they're going (15:25 - 15:29)
to have you to write and they're gonna (15:27 - 15:33)
deliver on the promise of the (15:29 - 15:36)
announcement trailer yeah the CEO of an (15:33 - 15:38)
antic already said we're going to get (15:36 - 15:39)
Legendary's this summer (15:38 - 15:43)
there are 4 5 well 5 5 Legendary's in (15:39 - 15:47)
generation 1 mu mu 2 Zapdos Articuno (15:43 - 15:50)
Moltres I would find it odd that they (15:47 - 15:52)
would do more than one (15:50 - 15:56)
I feel like this event is a here's your (15:52 - 15:58)
one legendary and if they're going to (15:56 - 16:01)
pick one legendary I would assume it has (15:58 - 16:03)
to be Mewtwo because it would be really (16:01 - 16:07)
odd if they just picked like Articuno (16:03 - 16:10)
for some reason and then people on Team (16:07 - 16:13)
valor and people on Team instinct would (16:10 - 16:15)
be kind of upset that is not whatever it (16:13 - 16:18)
were mu yeah I guess it could be mu but (16:15 - 16:25)
I or the legendary Pokemon arcanine we (16:18 - 16:26)
told you was gonna be a legendary summer (16:25 - 16:29)
here's the legendary Pokemon are right (16:26 - 16:31)
or you know all of the or it could be (16:29 - 16:34)
any gen 2 legendary as well that's true (16:31 - 16:35)
because they have released the gen 2 (16:34 - 16:39)
pokemons hmm I mean I imagine it's gonna (16:35 - 16:42)
be like something really big you to I (16:39 - 16:44)
feel like is the talking point though (16:42 - 16:46)
you're probably right I'm just playing (16:44 - 16:49)
the devil's advocate a little bit I'm (16:46 - 16:51)
not sure what you mean by talking point (16:49 - 16:54)
I would say if you only know generation (16:51 - 16:57)
1 Pokemon I guarantee out of all the (16:54 - 16:58)
pokemon names you heard which is (16:57 - 17:01)
probably Charizard Pikachu Meowth (16:58 - 17:04)
squirtle Mewtwo is in that conversation (17:01 - 17:07)
and nobody's seen Mewtwo yet so (17:04 - 17:09)
organizers have requested Jackson Drive (17:07 - 17:11)
which runs between Butler Field and the (17:09 - 17:14)
North Rose Garden to be closed between (17:11 - 17:16)
Columbus and lakeshore drives the map (17:14 - 17:19)
shows Jackson being the home to the (17:16 - 17:22)
events foodcourt although our organizers (17:19 - 17:25)
have received permission to sell alcohol (17:22 - 17:27)
the Niantic spokesperson said it will (17:25 - 17:30)
not be sold at the event clusters of (17:27 - 17:32)
Wi-Fi hotspots will be scattered around (17:30 - 17:34)
the park important because the game (17:32 - 17:37)
requires constant internet access to (17:34 - 17:38)
function will you got anything to (17:37 - 17:42)
comment on your Wi-Fi solution isn't (17:38 - 17:43)
isn't that exactly what I said was going (17:42 - 17:47)
to hell yeah yeah that's why the why (17:43 - 17:47)
they just proved me right I did they did (17:48 - 17:53)
this is probably the most (17:51 - 17:55)
in fact on here so turn up your radio a (17:53 - 18:01)
total of 66 portable restrooms are shown (17:55 - 18:07)
on the site map not 65 now 67 66 (18:01 - 18:09)
portable restrooms wait wait wait wait (18:07 - 18:10)
wait wait wait (18:09 - 18:14)
66 porta potties let's use the name that (18:10 - 18:16)
people are gonna recognize they're not (18:14 - 18:19)
there's none that no rest nor room nor (18:16 - 18:23)
room in any of these things I have no (18:19 - 18:25)
idea see how you're going to survive I'm (18:23 - 18:28)
sure you'll find like a Starbucks or (18:25 - 18:31)
something anyways 66 for 12,000 people (18:28 - 18:32)
15,000 people (18:31 - 18:37)
yeah we're 15 to 20,000 people here's (18:32 - 18:39)
here's a tip I found on reddit which I (18:37 - 18:43)
might actually take there is the this is (18:39 - 18:46)
gonna be bad I cannot bring a coffee can (18:43 - 18:50)
a classic Maxwell House coffee can with (18:46 - 18:59)
the plastic lid for me what pokemon go (18:50 - 19:03)
fest is right next to the Chicago Art (18:59 - 19:07)
Museum and I knew it was gonna be bad I (19:03 - 19:11)
think I heard guys how many like sweaty (19:07 - 19:13)
pokey man's are gonna be walking into (19:11 - 19:15)
the art museum like hey I don't care (19:13 - 19:19)
about your art but can i no no incorrect (19:15 - 19:23)
incorrect because unlike the Smithsonian (19:19 - 19:27)
museums of Washington DC did you know (19:23 - 19:29)
the rest of the country charge people to (19:27 - 19:33)
go in to museums yes yeah how cheap is (19:29 - 19:36)
that I liver is free art is for the (19:33 - 19:39)
people I trusted most museums you can (19:36 - 19:41)
use the restroom for free (19:39 - 19:43)
well no no the same way they'll use in (19:41 - 19:45)
the Gift Shop for free uh-huh Steve's (19:43 - 19:46)
gonna buy a day pass for the art means (19:45 - 19:48)
it was yeah that's gonna go into the (19:46 - 19:51)
glorious clean bathroom with all them (19:48 - 19:53)
Pokemon go cheapies who already spent (19:51 - 19:56)
$400 on a ticket to go stand in Grant (19:53 - 19:58)
Park and get a sunburn aren't gonna (19:56 - 20:00)
spend 10 more dollars to go and pee in (19:58 - 20:06)
the art meet ya gonna buy a pass for the (20:00 - 20:06)
this is the worst thing that's ever (20:09 - 20:21)
happened on this show how is this bad I (20:12 - 20:23)
will tell you how this I'm putting money (20:21 - 20:28)
in the economy no it's not it's not the (20:23 - 20:30)
utilitarian effect of your actions (20:28 - 20:35)
it's the like deontological like uh-uh (20:30 - 20:39)
if the intent that matters here like you (20:35 - 20:43)
you care so much more about Pokemon than (20:39 - 20:45)
this art that the old like that you're (20:43 - 20:47)
going to pay money to the Art Museum (20:45 - 20:50)
just to use the bathroom because the (20:47 - 20:53)
other crap happening over so much no no (20:50 - 20:55)
no no this is incorrect Pokemon is (20:53 - 20:57)
completely incidental to this Steve (20:55 - 21:01)
cares about a clean bathroom and a place (20:57 - 21:04)
to wash his guns more more than anything (21:01 - 21:08)
anything I am more than shocked Beauty (21:04 - 21:11)
the art the art will exist whether he (21:08 - 21:14)
pays for it or not I am shocked that (21:11 - 21:16)
Steve will use a rest stop on the side (21:14 - 21:18)
of the highway and not like some people (21:16 - 21:19)
I know (21:18 - 21:22)
find a hotel that is near the highway to (21:19 - 21:25)
use their restrooms to find the Platonic (21:22 - 21:27)
ideal of a sink (21:25 - 21:31)
there is something comforting (21:27 - 21:35)
using a clean master yet no one is (21:31 - 21:37)
denying that no one is saying like I'm (21:35 - 21:39)
not over here saying like you know what (21:37 - 21:42)
I love dirty bathroom like know what I'm (21:39 - 21:44)
saying that but what we know what I love (21:42 - 21:46)
dirty bathrooms because you know what (21:44 - 21:50)
they're not crowded get right in Oh all (21:46 - 21:55)
I'm saying your dedication to a way to (21:50 - 21:59)
like spotless porcelain is unfathomable (21:55 - 22:02)
you're telling me that if you had a (21:59 - 22:05)
choice between a porta potti that has (22:02 - 22:09)
been sitting in the Sun all day cooking (22:05 - 22:12)
whatever's in there 10 to 15 dollars and (22:09 - 22:18)
pay $5 for a bullet yeah I would I would (22:12 - 22:18)
tote (22:18 - 22:21)
we prefer like not having to pay to do (22:18 - 22:24)
the thing my body needs to do without my (22:21 - 22:25)
permission (22:24 - 22:29)
let me give hey to just be a slave to my (22:25 - 22:32)
own body's requirements but let me give (22:29 - 22:34)
you a different perspective I want each (22:32 - 22:38)
of you to run a marathon though has no (22:34 - 22:40)
I'm mad know what you'll find out is (22:38 - 22:44)
what a beautiful golden holy monument (22:40 - 22:50)
the port-a-john is it's there when you (22:44 - 22:55)
quit sidetrack do all marathon runners (22:50 - 22:58)
already know we're talking we're talking (22:55 - 22:59)
about how important the bathroom (22:58 - 23:01)
situation in Pokemon go is which is (22:59 - 23:04)
important do all marathon runners have a (23:01 - 23:08)
bathroom problem or is it just like 50% (23:04 - 23:12)
of them no okay no no no if you make one (23:08 - 23:14)
took a long time to finish right yeah (23:12 - 23:16)
but like I could hold I could not use a (23:14 - 23:18)
lot of water I cannot go to the bathroom (23:16 - 23:22)
for eight hours if I was like but not (23:18 - 23:24)
when you're running a marathon like (23:22 - 23:27)
interesting all this water but here's (23:24 - 23:27)
the thing (23:27 - 23:30)
if you plan properly you can do the (23:27 - 23:31)
whole marathon without going to the (23:30 - 23:34)
bathroom guess what hey number one life (23:31 - 23:37)
hack tip for all you kids out there the (23:34 - 23:39)
mo diem is not a banned drug for (23:37 - 23:44)
athletes so you can fend shut it down (23:39 - 23:46)
couple of hours before and here you know (23:44 - 23:48)
what I recommend Pokemon go fest maybe (23:46 - 23:54)
indulge so that's going way beyond baby (23:48 - 23:58)
or cell is an art museum toilet I'm just (23:54 - 24:00)
saying and this is not any issue that (23:58 - 24:02)
I've had cuz I plan right for the (24:00 - 24:05)
marathon so that's not an issue but as (24:02 - 24:07)
can we do a service community are there (24:05 - 24:09)
other locations besides the art museum (24:07 - 24:11)
that people might be able to target we (24:09 - 24:15)
can we can address that next week else (24:11 - 24:17)
do some scope it out and I'll get people (24:15 - 24:20)
the details next week hope mango fest (24:17 - 24:21)
organizers requested and receive (24:20 - 24:23)
permission to have inflatable (24:21 - 24:26)
inflatables on site what they might be (24:23 - 24:29)
is unclear but a Pikachu photo app is on (24:26 - 24:32)
the map near the petrel music shell (24:29 - 24:33)
assuming it's gonna be a giant blow-up (24:32 - 24:36)
Pikachu they bring it everywhere (24:33 - 24:39)
organizers didn't request permission to (24:36 - 24:42)
install any kinds of rides lifts or (24:39 - 24:44)
climbing walls nor petting zoos or (24:42 - 24:47)
pyrotechnics all checkboxes on the Park (24:44 - 24:50)
District's permit application so there (24:47 - 24:53)
you go no no climbing walls here's the (24:50 - 24:57)
question have they have they applied for (24:53 - 24:58)
permission to put pokey stops in that (24:57 - 25:01)
Park because I know if it was Milwaukee (24:58 - 25:05)
they get into a lot of trouble um I (25:01 - 25:08)
don't know but I do know what I do know (25:05 - 25:10)
is pretty sure the city of Chicago knows (25:08 - 25:13)
what's gonna go down like I don't think (25:10 - 25:15)
anyone is gonna be inside I'm pretty I'm (25:13 - 25:17)
also sure that I'm pretty sure the city (25:15 - 25:19)
of Chicago is loving this because of how (25:17 - 25:22)
much revenue they're going to bring to (25:19 - 25:25)
this area I do know though that on the (25:22 - 25:27)
same day the Hat Pikachu started I (25:25 - 25:30)
noticed a new gym near my work and I saw (25:27 - 25:32)
on Twitter and in slack that people were (25:30 - 25:34)
saying new pocus tops and gyms were were (25:32 - 25:37)
in area as they visited frequently so (25:34 - 25:39)
maybe these these stops have already (25:37 - 25:42)
been added or maybe I'm well obviously (25:39 - 25:44)
nee antic has the ability to add or (25:42 - 25:47)
remove stops instantly so there is a a (25:44 - 25:50)
map of where stops are going to be and (25:47 - 25:53)
it looks like there are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 (25:50 - 25:58)
9 10 11 12 13 stops in the reserved area (25:53 - 26:01)
not including gyms the fact that's (25:58 - 26:05)
that's not 100% final the last bullet (26:01 - 26:08)
point is the Park District permit cost (26:05 - 26:11)
organizers $50,000 according to the (26:08 - 26:13)
application details about the event (26:11 - 26:18)
could change but the permission dates (26:13 - 26:23)
was established in March and was last (26:18 - 26:27)
modified on June 14th $50,000 for this (26:23 - 26:28)
event (26:27 - 26:32)
I think the upsetting thing for Pokemon (26:28 - 26:34)
go players this week was the Pokemon go (26:32 - 26:37)
anniversary event box for the (26:34 - 26:40)
anniversary we got the hat hat at (26:37 - 26:42)
Pikachu and there are some people that (26:40 - 26:44)
like that and some people that don't I'm (26:42 - 26:48)
in the I'm in the camp that I like this (26:44 - 26:52)
because it lets you find a Pokemon in (26:48 - 26:55)
the wild that you don't have and it just (26:52 - 26:58)
happens to be Pikachu but regardless of (26:55 - 27:00)
what pokemon it is if they ever did like (26:58 - 27:04)
a swirl with glasses or a crystal onyx (27:00 - 27:06)
only a couple people might get that (27:04 - 27:07)
reference if their all-time anime (27:06 - 27:10)
watchers to me that's still exciting (27:07 - 27:11)
because I still get excited when I (27:10 - 27:13)
discover a Pokemon I don't have and (27:11 - 27:16)
that's pretty rare at this point because (27:13 - 27:19)
most of the Pokemon I need are Pokemon (27:16 - 27:21)
that you can't find in the wild like (27:19 - 27:25)
blossom or porygon - so to stumble upon (27:21 - 27:27)
a Pokemon and go oh I don't have that (27:25 - 27:28)
that's what I've been looking for it (27:27 - 27:29)
just happens to be Pikachu with a hat (27:28 - 27:31)
I'm down with that I think a lot of (27:29 - 27:35)
people forgot that we just got a gym (27:31 - 27:39)
revamp and we just got raids two weeks (27:35 - 27:41)
ago and that was a start to this (27:39 - 27:44)
anniversary when you see people going (27:41 - 27:47)
well this is a really lame anniversary (27:44 - 27:50)
event you can't just look at Ash hat (27:47 - 27:52)
Pikachu it's it's more than that (27:50 - 27:54)
now if we're gonna talk disappointing I (27:52 - 27:57)
will agree and I will be an advocate for (27:54 - 28:01)
how disappointing this sale boxes as (27:57 - 28:03)
somebody who is very comfortable with (28:01 - 28:05)
spending money in Pokemon go or other (28:03 - 28:08)
games because I'm an adult with a job (28:05 - 28:10)
and I don't mind spending money if it (28:08 - 28:12)
gets me some kind of enjoyment the box (28:10 - 28:17)
they're selling is 12,000 pokey coins or (28:12 - 28:21)
sorry 1200 pokey coins would be one (28:17 - 28:25)
expensive box twelve dollars in in US (28:21 - 28:25)
money (28:25 - 28:29)
it includes six egg incubators two (28:25 - 28:32)
premium raid passes six mac max revives (28:29 - 28:35)
and 20 ultra balls what you can actually (28:32 - 28:37)
buy from this separately is a premium (28:35 - 28:39)
rate pass they're a hundred coins each (28:37 - 28:41)
so they're a dollar you get two of these (28:39 - 28:42)
in the box so we're (28:41 - 28:45)
two dollars six egg incubators this is (28:42 - 28:47)
something that I planned on buying quite (28:45 - 28:49)
a bit of before Pokemon go fest because (28:47 - 28:52)
at Pokemon go fest and I think in other (28:49 - 28:56)
areas they haven't exactly said they did (28:52 - 28:58)
say that they will be giving out special (28:56 - 29:00)
2k eggs throughout the day that can (28:58 - 29:03)
hatch who knows what I'm hoping that (29:00 - 29:05)
those hatched like the hair are crosses (29:03 - 29:07)
and the corsa lows and the far fetches (29:05 - 29:10)
and all the Pokemon not available in the (29:07 - 29:11)
United States that's that's my hope at (29:10 - 29:14)
least those egg incubators are a hundred (29:11 - 29:17)
150 Pokemon coins so dollar fifty (29:14 - 29:19)
they're giving you six of those so (29:17 - 29:21)
that's nine dollars so we're up to (29:19 - 29:23)
eleven dollars here they're giving you (29:21 - 29:27)
six max revives which I think everyone (29:23 - 29:29)
would agree probably the most worthless (29:27 - 29:31)
item in the box it's a hundred and (29:29 - 29:34)
eighty coins so dollar eighty and (29:31 - 29:36)
they're giving you 20 ultra balls which (29:34 - 29:43)
is unbelievable for a dollar a dollar or (29:36 - 29:46)
a hundred pokeballs for four dollars and (29:43 - 29:49)
sixty cents either way if you do all the (29:46 - 29:52)
math this box adds up if you were to buy (29:49 - 29:54)
it without the sale to twelve hundred (29:52 - 29:57)
and eighty poker coins so the sale the (29:54 - 30:01)
quote-unquote sale is 80 cents off plus (29:57 - 30:04)
twenty ultra balls and that's not much (30:01 - 30:06)
of a sale with a bunch of other stuff (30:04 - 30:07)
like you probably don't even need like (30:06 - 30:09)
the revives right yeah you don't need (30:07 - 30:12)
the revives the premium rate passes are (30:09 - 30:14)
nice the egg incubators are nice the (30:12 - 30:17)
altar balls are nice but you also get (30:14 - 30:19)
them for free just by going to stop sits (30:17 - 30:22)
now they're not terribly hard to get you (30:19 - 30:23)
also get a lot of ultra balls when you (30:22 - 30:26)
level up like I just hit level 29 and I (30:23 - 30:28)
think he gave me 10 or 20 ultra balls (30:26 - 30:31)
just for leveling up it's just a real (30:28 - 30:35)
bummer of a scale unlike the Christmas (30:31 - 30:37)
and New Year sale they they had they had (30:35 - 30:40)
multiple boxes with most sales obviously (30:37 - 30:42)
the more money you spend the better the (30:40 - 30:46)
deal is but just just for reference here (30:42 - 30:48)
I'll point out the Pokemon Christmas go (30:46 - 30:50)
event so they had what is what was (30:48 - 30:53)
called an ultra box which was 1500 coins (30:50 - 30:56)
so $15 you got (30:53 - 31:00)
20 ultra balls six egg incubators and 25 (30:56 - 31:06)
incense and 25 incense was 1,250 Pokemon (31:00 - 31:09)
coins plus the cycle six egg incubators (31:06 - 31:13)
which was 900 Pokemon coins so you're (31:09 - 31:16)
saving you're saving about 600 you're (31:13 - 31:19)
saving about $6 there if I did my math (31:16 - 31:21)
right plus you're getting 20 ultra balls (31:19 - 31:24)
for free now that's a deal now might not (31:21 - 31:27)
be the best deal but it's a better deal (31:24 - 31:30)
than saving 80 cents the new year sale (31:27 - 31:32)
the gold polka box (31:30 - 31:34)
that you could buy was I'm gonna round (31:32 - 31:38)
up 20 coins here was 2500 coins (31:34 - 31:40)
you're getting 50 great balls which is (31:38 - 31:46)
unbel 25 in cents 25 lucky eggs and 16 (31:40 - 31:49)
lure modules 16 lower modules is about (31:46 - 31:53)
$14 25 lucky eggs is about twelve (31:49 - 31:56)
dollars and fifty great balls are unbel (31:53 - 31:59)
so you're saving some money there too (31:56 - 32:01)
you're saving I think about another six (31:59 - 32:04)
or seven dollars there too when you put (32:01 - 32:06)
on paper that a player is saving about (32:04 - 32:08)
five dollars and then you look at the (32:06 - 32:10)
sale and you're not even saving a dollar (32:08 - 32:13)
I mean that's that's night and day of (32:10 - 32:16)
how good the sale actually is so it's a (32:13 - 32:20)
little bit disappointing that this is an (32:16 - 32:23)
opportunity to give Pokemon go money to (32:20 - 32:25)
celebrate well you and there's there's (32:23 - 32:27)
debate whether you should or should not (32:25 - 32:28)
give money but if you're willing to buy (32:27 - 32:31)
stuff and you're told there's a sale (32:28 - 32:33)
coming up and you're like okay I've been (32:31 - 32:35)
playing this game for a year I'll give (32:33 - 32:37)
them a couple bucks because look at how (32:35 - 32:40)
much value I got for a year or I'm gonna (32:37 - 32:41)
give them money because I've always been (32:40 - 32:44)
giving them money this is just a huge (32:41 - 32:46)
letdown I mean I agree 100% you're not (32:44 - 32:47)
the first person I've seen complaining (32:46 - 32:51)
about this who was was that an actual (32:47 - 32:53)
question of who was the first person I (32:51 - 32:57)
saw I asked that I don't really care it (32:53 - 32:59)
was somebody in England because they (32:57 - 33:00)
were complaining that it was 14 pounds (32:59 - 33:03)
now is that pound sterling (33:00 - 33:06)
I have no idea wait what's the day this (33:03 - 33:08)
is going there's no difference it's just (33:06 - 33:11)
sterling is the ooh let's see if I (33:08 - 33:13)
actually know this I believe sterling is (33:11 - 33:14)
just the term for the currency itself (33:13 - 33:19)
and pounds is the term for just like the (33:14 - 33:21)
the bill so we don't really have an (33:19 - 33:23)
equivalent in the US but it would be (33:21 - 33:25)
like you know how if we say like if (33:23 - 33:27)
we're talking about the currency we (33:25 - 33:30)
would say US dollars mm-hmm and then if (33:27 - 33:31)
we were just gonna say how much (33:30 - 33:33)
something cost you'd say like it's ten (33:31 - 33:36)
dollars like in in Britain they have oh (33:33 - 33:39)
let's see I might be wrong but I think (33:36 - 33:42)
the way it works in the UK is the (33:39 - 33:45)
currency as a whole is called sterling (33:42 - 33:49)
and pounds and pence (33:45 - 33:53)
I think either like terms for the the (33:49 - 33:57)
different denominations that make up the (33:53 - 34:00)
currency sterling and probably so wrong (33:57 - 34:02)
I have a question hopefully it doesn't (34:00 - 34:06)
go to off the rails okay Britain uses (34:02 - 34:10)
pounds right mm-hmm well the United (34:06 - 34:12)
Kingdom uses okay sure we don't know we (34:10 - 34:15)
are doing better had that had that mess (34:12 - 34:18)
of a conversation and there was I think (34:15 - 34:21)
it was a Lance black sent me a pretty (34:18 - 34:23)
great video that I could be wrong I (34:21 - 34:25)
apologize we have a lot of people from (34:23 - 34:27)
the United Kingdom in slack and they're (34:25 - 34:30)
all really great and they tried to sum (34:27 - 34:32)
it up but it gave me more questions than (34:30 - 34:34)
it did answers like I understood the (34:32 - 34:37)
video but it doesn't the rest of Europe (34:34 - 34:42)
use euros yes over the UK is is an (34:37 - 34:45)
interesting exception so even though (34:42 - 34:48)
well for a little while the UK is is is (34:45 - 34:52)
in the European Union I believe when it (34:48 - 34:55)
entered the European Union it from the (34:52 - 34:57)
start had the stipulation that it wasn't (34:55 - 35:00)
gonna play this game of yes correct this (34:57 - 35:04)
centralized European currency the euro (35:00 - 35:06)
and the sort of an exception was made (35:04 - 35:07)
for the United Kingdom that they got to (35:06 - 35:12)
keep their native currency so if I go to (35:07 - 35:14)
Europe to get myself a mr. mime which is (35:12 - 35:16)
just a hypothetical that's not going to (35:14 - 35:17)
happen (35:16 - 35:19)
and I go to like France first and I have (35:17 - 35:22)
all these euros and then I go over to (35:19 - 35:26)
Britain because because it's just a (35:22 - 35:29)
right over the right over the pond I (35:26 - 35:31)
don't know they go it you go through you (35:29 - 35:33)
go through the channel ah it's called (35:31 - 35:35)
the channel so I go through the channel (35:33 - 35:37)
I get to Britain and all I have now is (35:35 - 35:40)
euros do they take that but you have to (35:37 - 35:42)
convert them like any currency exchange (35:40 - 35:44)
and then when I go back like I want to (35:42 - 35:46)
hit up Germany on my way back I have to (35:44 - 35:49)
convert it again right yeah you have (35:46 - 35:52)
really planned your trip and very poorly (35:49 - 35:54)
because you're like literally crossing a (35:52 - 35:56)
body of water and then crossing the same (35:54 - 36:01)
body of water I'm just I see money in (35:56 - 36:03)
London I seem to have been wrong about (36:01 - 36:05)
my previous guess of what the sterling (36:03 - 36:07)
and pound sterling means apparently it's (36:05 - 36:11)
just called pound sterling and it's just (36:07 - 36:13)
it's just what it's called and I was (36:11 - 36:15)
wrong about my previous guess all right (36:13 - 36:18)
I have an interview here with Niantic (36:15 - 36:22)
and John Hanke about the first year (36:18 - 36:24)
Pokemon go and what's coming next this (36:22 - 36:26)
is off the verge I won't go through the (36:24 - 36:28)
entire interview you can go to the verge (36:26 - 36:30)
come to read that now that you're coming (36:28 - 36:31)
up on the one-year anniversary how do (36:30 - 36:32)
you feel about the state of the game and (36:31 - 36:35)
where you want it to be so Yantic I'll (36:32 - 36:37)
just saying the antic says well it's (36:35 - 36:39)
been a great year we've been incredibly (36:37 - 36:41)
grateful for everything that that has (36:39 - 36:42)
happened we've gotten ourselves into a (36:41 - 36:44)
position where we're able to put a lot (36:42 - 36:46)
more resources onto the team over the (36:44 - 36:48)
past year we are careful in hiring (36:46 - 36:50)
people so we've ramped up over the (36:48 - 36:52)
course of the year but finally seeing (36:50 - 36:55)
the fruits of that fruits that in the (36:52 - 36:57)
gym andrade release which we'll get to (36:55 - 37:00)
in the near which gets things that are (36:57 - 37:01)
near and dear to our heart like (37:00 - 37:04)
cooperative social game play things that (37:01 - 37:06)
pull people together outside so we are (37:04 - 37:08)
really happy with the initial phase of (37:06 - 37:11)
this that release we're super excited (37:08 - 37:13)
about how that's going to interact with (37:11 - 37:15)
the events we've lined up for the (37:13 - 37:16)
duration of the summer in Chicago (37:15 - 37:20)
Yokohama and Europe it's been great to (37:16 - 37:22)
get that release out there and fix some (37:20 - 37:24)
aspects of the gyms that were bugging us (37:22 - 37:26)
that we didn't really like but we had to (37:24 - 37:28)
leave things when we shipped the product (37:26 - 37:31)
but we're really happy with the release (37:28 - 37:31)
in (37:31 - 37:33)
June and we're glad to see a positive (37:31 - 37:36)
response it has been really energizing (37:33 - 37:37)
to the playerbase (37:36 - 37:39)
and I think that will do even more so in (37:37 - 37:43)
June and July as the events take part (37:39 - 37:45)
when you look back over the last 12 (37:43 - 37:46)
months are the things you would have (37:45 - 37:48)
done differently that changed (37:46 - 37:50)
differently with the perspective you had (37:48 - 37:52)
now the antics said we have delayed the (37:50 - 37:54)
ability to get things like gyms and (37:52 - 37:55)
raids and we haven't gotten to our (37:54 - 37:57)
player-versus-player and some other (37:55 - 37:58)
things that we thought we'd be able to (37:57 - 38:00)
do pretty shortly after launch but we (37:58 - 38:04)
only had so much money and well anymore (38:00 - 38:06)
guys and we were doing that we were (38:04 - 38:08)
doing what we thought were it was (38:06 - 38:10)
reasonable what about in terms of (38:08 - 38:13)
communication do you wish you hadn't (38:10 - 38:16)
talked about things like PPV PR trading (38:13 - 38:17)
given how long they're taken to (38:16 - 38:20)
implement the antics said what we had (38:17 - 38:23)
well had we not had to divert resources (38:20 - 38:26)
to infrastructure versus features I (38:23 - 38:28)
think we would have had some of those (38:26 - 38:31)
things out earlier I don't know if we (38:28 - 38:33)
had known we were going to have those (38:31 - 38:35)
delays maybe we wouldn't have talked (38:33 - 38:36)
about them so much although it's (38:35 - 38:38)
important to let people know what you're (38:36 - 38:40)
thinking about certain things and that (38:38 - 38:42)
you're building towards them even if (38:40 - 38:43)
they're not immediately available I (38:42 - 38:46)
think early on between ourselves the (38:43 - 38:48)
Pokemon company and Nintendo there (38:46 - 38:51)
wasn't really a consistent consensus (38:48 - 38:54)
about how to communicate with players on (38:51 - 38:56)
forums reddit Twitter and other social (38:54 - 38:59)
media platforms with our previous game (38:56 - 39:02)
ingress we were very communicative with (38:59 - 39:04)
the players and very open on a side note (39:02 - 39:06)
I heard ingress players say that's not (39:04 - 39:10)
100% true but ok the antic says hey and (39:06 - 39:13)
we weren't as communicative and open in (39:10 - 39:14)
the beginning of Pokemon go because that (39:13 - 39:16)
was sort of a new process for our (39:14 - 39:17)
partners (39:16 - 39:19)
I think we've become much more open over (39:17 - 39:22)
time which I agree with and I think that (39:19 - 39:25)
really helps make the community happier (39:22 - 39:29)
by us being present and talking about (39:25 - 39:31)
what's going on more has there been a (39:29 - 39:34)
sizeable effort internally to fight (39:31 - 39:36)
cheating from the outside it definitely (39:34 - 39:38)
seems like a lot of effort was put (39:36 - 39:40)
forward the antics says we dedicate (39:38 - 39:43)
resource to it for sure there are some (39:40 - 39:44)
people working on the (39:43 - 39:46)
on the team that could be working on (39:44 - 39:48)
other features but they're not implying (39:46 - 39:50)
they're working on this it's a fraction (39:48 - 39:53)
of the team it's not half the team (39:50 - 39:54)
that's working at it but it's (39:53 - 39:55)
significantly less than that but there (39:54 - 39:57)
is a chunk of resources we devote to (39:55 - 40:00)
cheating and then finally the final (39:57 - 40:02)
question I skipped some what do you (40:00 - 40:03)
think is the most important update or (40:02 - 40:05)
changes you've made to the game with (40:03 - 40:07)
regards to keeping player feedback (40:05 - 40:10)
coming back regularly well with regards (40:07 - 40:12)
to keeping players coming back regularly (40:10 - 40:14)
the antics said if I had to single out (40:12 - 40:17)
one it's the gyms and raid update that (40:14 - 40:19)
we just put out it really is the nurse (40:17 - 40:22)
it really is the first new mechanic that (40:19 - 40:23)
gives players the motivation to keep (40:22 - 40:25)
playing to keep leveling up pokemon and (40:23 - 40:27)
to continue to get out there and be (40:25 - 40:29)
active the collecting mechanic was (40:27 - 40:31)
something that was really the heart of (40:29 - 40:33)
the game and still is the heart of the (40:31 - 40:36)
game for new users but this improves the (40:33 - 40:38)
game for other players for players that (40:36 - 40:40)
have reached a certain level I think (40:38 - 40:43)
that's the single biggest change because (40:40 - 40:45)
of the challenge and the opportunity of (40:43 - 40:47)
the fund that it presents to more (40:45 - 40:49)
experienced players and also it's (40:47 - 40:51)
designed to encourage cooperative play (40:49 - 40:54)
which is the core to our mission so (40:51 - 40:54)
there you go (40:54 - 40:56)
that's the interview that you can read (40:54 - 41:00)
the rest of it on the verge you guys (40:56 - 41:03)
have any feedback regards to that I know (41:00 - 41:05)
they mentioned the Pokemon company in (41:03 - 41:06)
Nintendo and they mentioned that (41:05 - 41:09)
collecting was important pretty much all (41:06 - 41:11)
the Pokemon things you would expect but (41:09 - 41:13)
yeah I'm doing very poorly at the (41:11 - 41:15)
collecting aspect I just looked at my (41:13 - 41:19)
pokedex and shoes I got a ways to go (41:15 - 41:22)
what's what's your decks number I have (41:19 - 41:25)
caught 50 I think about the (41:22 - 41:28)
engine is hoot-hoot now I think the only (41:25 - 41:32)
bit that I disagree with is is their (41:28 - 41:36)
claim that about how basically defending (41:32 - 41:39)
themselves for saying if there was going (41:36 - 41:42)
to be trading and battling way back way (41:39 - 41:45)
before it's those features still don't (41:42 - 41:47)
exist and don't look like they're going (41:45 - 41:50)
to for a long time when the (41:47 - 41:51)
representative said something along the (41:50 - 41:54)
lines of oh it's good to just let (41:51 - 41:56)
everybody know what's coming down the (41:54 - 41:56)
pipeline (41:56 - 41:58)
I find that to be (41:56 - 42:02)
a strange response given that it doesn't (41:58 - 42:04)
even seem like it was in the pipeline at (42:02 - 42:06)
that point because it's bits it's been (42:04 - 42:08)
so long it's there's a point at which it (42:06 - 42:12)
is kind of disingenuous to market your (42:08 - 42:15)
game in that way when that's so far off (42:12 - 42:17)
into the horizon you know I don't know (42:15 - 42:20)
yeah so this is typical tech executives (42:17 - 42:23)
speak and I have her had first-hand (42:20 - 42:25)
experience with this where you know a (42:23 - 42:28)
tech executive will actually ask the (42:25 - 42:30)
people who do operational work oh you (42:28 - 42:33)
know do you think we could have (42:30 - 42:35)
player-versus-player battles in Pokemon (42:33 - 42:36)
go and the operational people would be (42:35 - 42:39)
like yeah sure we can do that and then (42:36 - 42:40)
the tech executive takes that (42:39 - 42:43)
immediately to mean by next week versus (42:40 - 42:46)
the three years given the resources (42:43 - 42:48)
you've provided us that will be required (42:46 - 42:51)
to actually deliver that you know tech (42:48 - 42:53)
executives they're more on think and you (42:51 - 42:56)
just can't take them for much I think (42:53 - 42:58)
that's a good point that will make as (42:56 - 43:01)
somebody who works on a company's (42:58 - 43:05)
website as my nine-to-five job there's (43:01 - 43:08)
always there's like this big not (43:05 - 43:11)
disconnect but maybe not full (43:08 - 43:13)
understanding of how things are done (43:11 - 43:17)
tech wise with the website when I'm in a (43:13 - 43:20)
meeting and a group of people say hey we (43:17 - 43:22)
want to do with this with the website is (43:20 - 43:23)
that possible the answer is yes (43:22 - 43:25)
definitely (43:23 - 43:28)
but they're never thinking about their I (43:25 - 43:31)
I think what they're thinking is oh (43:28 - 43:34)
Steve's gonna say no because of this (43:31 - 43:37)
this and this when in reality anything (43:34 - 43:38)
is possible (43:37 - 43:41)
on a website if you want this drop down (43:38 - 43:44)
on all the product pages to have (43:41 - 43:46)
customers sign up for a subscription or (43:44 - 43:48)
something sure I can do that but I don't (43:46 - 43:53)
but the people asking the question are (43:48 - 43:55)
more concerned with the no or yes (43:53 - 43:59)
instead of instead of how much time it (43:55 - 44:02)
would take so your timing Riis right (43:59 - 44:04)
that's right they don't think about time (44:02 - 44:05)
and review so I can say yes and then (44:04 - 44:08)
follow up but that's going to take I (44:05 - 44:10)
don't know let's just say three months (44:08 - 44:11)
to implement (44:10 - 44:13)
and then all of a sudden it's like was (44:11 - 44:17)
that worth our time because hey if it's (44:13 - 44:18)
gonna take me three months and I'm the (44:17 - 44:21)
only person here I can't work on these (44:18 - 44:23)
other projects that you've suggested in (44:21 - 44:25)
the past because I can't do both at once (44:23 - 44:27)
well maybe I can but this is just an (44:25 - 44:30)
example so I would imagine the same (44:27 - 44:32)
conversations happen here where hey can (44:30 - 44:35)
we do trading yeah totally except if we (44:32 - 44:38)
do trading it's gonna take this long to (44:35 - 44:40)
implement where that person just heard (44:38 - 44:41)
hey we can do they said we can do (44:40 - 44:43)
trading so let's tell our customer base (44:41 - 44:45)
that we can do it that makes sense (44:43 - 44:49)
aye aye I'd say I would give you two and (44:45 - 44:50)
if somebody wants to become a tech (44:49 - 44:52)
executive here's here's your guidelines (44:50 - 44:53)
on two things that you need to have as (44:52 - 44:55)
part of your personality to be a (44:53 - 44:57)
successful tech example number one (44:55 - 45:00)
willful ignorance about the realities of (44:57 - 45:02)
what it takes to bring a product to the (45:00 - 45:05)
market and even if somebody comes to you (45:02 - 45:07)
and gives you a step-by-step explanation (45:05 - 45:09)
of what it's actually going to take to (45:07 - 45:11)
bring something in the market like a (45:09 - 45:13)
second later you just forget that and (45:11 - 45:16)
remain ignorant of it and to the ease (45:13 - 45:19)
and great ability to take credit for (45:16 - 45:22)
other people's work and feel a lot of (45:19 - 45:24)
satisfaction in the work that other (45:22 - 45:28)
people have accomplished for you that (45:24 - 45:32)
very great industry it's like a great (45:28 - 45:34)
industry that maybe like everybody's (45:32 - 45:36)
gonna have a great time in yeah totally (45:34 - 45:38)
there's a part in the interview that I (45:36 - 45:39)
skipped over because the overall the (45:38 - 45:41)
question wasn't that interesting the (45:39 - 45:43)
answer wasn't that interesting but the (45:41 - 45:47)
the response was pretty much the antics (45:43 - 45:48)
said they're six months behind with (45:47 - 45:52)
everything so what that means is this (45:48 - 45:54)
Jim Andrade update should have been six (45:52 - 45:57)
months ago and generation two should (45:54 - 45:59)
have been six months ago from when it (45:57 - 46:02)
came out and whatever update other (45:59 - 46:04)
updates they did just think of it as (46:02 - 46:06)
those updates were extremely late to (46:04 - 46:10)
what their original map or game plan (46:06 - 46:13)
said so while I believe that trading and (46:10 - 46:17)
PvP is still coming which is which is (46:13 - 46:19)
fine I think that's all right (46:17 - 46:23)
there are still questions that (46:19 - 46:24)
have not been answered which I think are (46:23 - 46:27)
more important so in the in the sense of (46:24 - 46:32)
PvP what is the benefit of that like (46:27 - 46:34)
what what happens with players that (46:32 - 46:37)
makes that compelling or fun to do (46:34 - 46:39)
because I'll be the first one to get up (46:37 - 46:42)
and say wow I liked the concept of gyms (46:39 - 46:46)
and raids and I love the meeting new (46:42 - 46:49)
people and I definitely like three days (46:46 - 46:51)
ago did a venusaur raid by myself and (46:49 - 46:53)
five other strangers and we were all (46:51 - 46:54)
talking and they were all really great (46:53 - 46:56)
and really nice and we talked about (46:54 - 46:57)
going to Pokemon go fast and one of the (46:56 - 46:59)
guys well it was really funny because (46:57 - 47:02)
after we finished the raid one of the (46:59 - 47:05)
guys was like who's pkmn cast like what (47:02 - 47:07)
and I was like oh that's that's me (47:05 - 47:09)
that's my user name and they're like (47:07 - 47:11)
like the pod cast and I was like yeah (47:09 - 47:13)
yeah III do Pokemon pod cast (47:11 - 47:15)
they're like oh my gosh I listened to (47:13 - 47:17)
that I was like oh wow that's really (47:15 - 47:18)
cool (47:17 - 47:20)
and we talked for a little bit so (47:18 - 47:24)
everything about gyms is so great like (47:20 - 47:26)
what I just said the meeting new people (47:24 - 47:29)
the cooperation the the going out and (47:26 - 47:32)
doing it like it's all great but the (47:29 - 47:36)
actual battle is the most non substance (47:32 - 47:39)
boring thing in the world I've just tap (47:36 - 47:42)
as fast as you can you could dodge if (47:39 - 47:44)
you want to but why does it matter I (47:42 - 47:48)
have 700 revives who cares it's just not (47:44 - 47:52)
enjoyable but the concepts there so when (47:48 - 47:53)
you tell me that hey we're working on (47:52 - 47:59)
pvp III what is the benefit they're like (47:53 - 48:00)
what (47:59 - 48:02)
I'm sure they'll think of something that (48:00 - 48:04)
I I can beat you in a battle and then (48:02 - 48:06)
say that I am better than you (48:04 - 48:08)
yeah what more do you need I don't know (48:06 - 48:10)
but it but is it I can beat you in a (48:08 - 48:13)
battle or is it who spent more time with (48:10 - 48:16)
Pokemon go and who tapped faster I mean (48:13 - 48:18)
once the different matter (48:16 - 48:22)
actly and I I would hope that trading is (48:18 - 48:25)
coming and they said that it I mean that (48:22 - 48:26)
they didn't say they're cancelling it (48:25 - 48:30)
but I I do think that they have to put (48:26 - 48:32)
more efforts or they have to really (48:30 - 48:37)
figure out a way to get rid of the (48:32 - 48:39)
cheating that has already existed and (48:37 - 48:41)
you're gonna always have cheaters on (48:39 - 48:43)
online games like I'm sure that they're (48:41 - 48:45)
still cheating and overwatch and (48:43 - 48:47)
counter-strike and whatever other games (48:45 - 48:50)
that are out there but at least I don't (48:47 - 48:52)
want and I'm sure other people don't (48:50 - 48:54)
want a situation like the mainstream (48:52 - 48:58)
Pokemon games where I'm to the point in (48:54 - 49:01)
the mainstream games where I'm scared to (48:58 - 49:03)
do wonder trading because I don't know (49:01 - 49:05)
if I'm getting legit or non legit (49:03 - 49:07)
Pokemon and I and while some people (49:05 - 49:11)
don't care I do care I don't want an (49:07 - 49:12)
action replayed (49:11 - 49:15)
red Gyarados in my Pokemon bank I agree (49:12 - 49:17)
now why would you use a cheating device (49:15 - 49:20)
to get a red Gyarados the most common (49:17 - 49:24)
the shiny everyone has if they've if (49:20 - 49:26)
they were like hey we want to do trading (49:24 - 49:28)
we haven't mastered the cheating aspects (49:26 - 49:30)
of it I will wait till that has been (49:28 - 49:32)
mastered well just never trade with (49:30 - 49:35)
anybody with an Android device so what (49:32 - 49:37)
we'll do now is we'll take a quick break (49:35 - 49:42)
I just want to run down the two winner (49:37 - 49:45)
or the winner of the Masters video game (49:42 - 49:47)
competition in the Masters TCG comm (49:45 - 49:49)
competition so we'll run down those (49:47 - 49:51)
after break we'll do a couple emails and (49:49 - 49:53)
then travis has our pokemon of the week (49:51 - 49:55)
so we'll take a quick break and we'll be (49:53 - 49:59)
right back after this (49:55 - 49:59)
bang-bang (50:06 - 50:09)
[Music] (50:22 - 50:25)
yep (50:30 - 50:37)
[Music] (50:33 - 50:37)
and we are back from our break let's (50:39 - 50:47)
talk about some TCG masters division (50:44 - 50:50)
yeah I'll be right back (50:47 - 50:52)
so we're just gonna be talking about (50:50 - 50:55)
masters so the master championship the (50:52 - 51:00)
the champion for the TCG masters (50:55 - 51:04)
division is toward rec live and the (51:00 - 51:07)
runner-up was John Cutler and the decks (51:04 - 51:11)
being used for that toured from Norway (51:07 - 51:15)
was running a duranta gar boater and (51:11 - 51:20)
tapu lele GX and John Cutler was running (51:15 - 51:25)
decidua vileplume Shaymin IX lugia e^x (51:20 - 51:30)
and tapu Lele hmm and if we jump over to (51:25 - 51:34)
the VGC the master division there the (51:30 - 51:37)
winner was Christopher Kon and the (51:34 - 51:41)
runner-up was Paul chow and Christopher (51:37 - 51:46)
Kon of Australia was running porygon to (51:41 - 51:51)
Kapoor Coco Gyarados Arcanine Garchomp (51:46 - 51:55)
and Snorlax and the runner-up Paul was (51:51 - 51:59)
running not a lowland ninetails Garchomp (51:55 - 52:03)
Arcanine tapu Coco Sela Stila (51:59 - 52:07)
and Snorlax so I wonder if the junior (52:03 - 52:10)
winner Nicholas Khan is related to the (52:07 - 52:12)
Masters winner Christopher Kon (52:10 - 52:14)
interesting they both have the same last (52:12 - 52:17)
name and it's not a common last name (52:14 - 52:19)
they're both from Australia (52:17 - 52:23)
no that seals it and seals the deal and (52:19 - 52:27)
Australians are cheaters so I am this (52:23 - 52:28)
has been said in the show I am not (52:27 - 52:32)
really into competitive VGC but when I (52:28 - 52:34)
look at this Travis correct me if I'm (52:32 - 52:38)
wrong but I'm seeing for Pokemon that (52:34 - 52:41)
are the same between this type of Coco (52:38 - 52:45)
Gyarados Arcanine and but sorry not (52:41 - 52:47)
geared us Garchomp (52:45 - 52:50)
Arcanine Snorlax and top of Coco if I'm (52:47 - 52:53)
not mistaken Garchomp has been pretty (52:50 - 52:57)
dominant in every every single year (52:53 - 53:02)
I feel like Garchomp has made it to the (52:57 - 53:03)
end (53:02 - 53:05)
I mean Garchomp is quite a large boy (53:03 - 53:08)
Garchomp is kind of the this is for a (53:05 - 53:10)
long time been sort of the go-to for (53:08 - 53:15)
like I need a big dragon that can deal a (53:10 - 53:18)
lot of damage and be fairly fast the (53:15 - 53:20)
typing is pretty good I mean there was a (53:18 - 53:22)
lot of big dragons there's salamence (53:20 - 53:24)
there's Dragon Knight right but being (53:22 - 53:27)
able to have like a same type of tack (53:24 - 53:30)
bonus earthquake and just the base stats (53:27 - 53:34)
are kind of what you want them to be for (53:30 - 53:38)
that niche like it's a very strong (53:34 - 53:41)
pocket monster what's what's the what is (53:38 - 53:45)
garchomps foil what one pokemon destroys (53:41 - 53:48)
Garchomp instantly what you want to talk (53:45 - 53:50)
about aloe and ninetails like I mean (53:48 - 53:53)
that's that's in there I mean it's it's (53:50 - 53:58)
any any ice type move right cuz mochas (53:53 - 54:00)
like most garchomps (53:58 - 54:05)
aren't running the ice defense Barry (54:00 - 54:11)
whatever whatever that one is and lo1 (54:05 - 54:15)
ninetails outspeeds Garchomp so just use (54:11 - 54:18)
blizzard and it's probably gonna be dead (54:15 - 54:21)
papa Coco I think every single team had (54:18 - 54:24)
taboo Coco what's your analysis on that (54:21 - 54:26)
I mean our k9 is more common but top of (54:24 - 54:28)
Coco is like probably the second most (54:26 - 54:31)
used Pokemon why I guess is it is it (54:28 - 54:35)
electric terrain is it it's I feel like (54:31 - 54:38)
I saw that Z move out of everyone else (54:35 - 54:41)
does he move more I mean it's kind of (54:38 - 54:45)
like any Pokemon that can set up some (54:41 - 54:50)
type of stage effect that benefits (54:45 - 54:53)
itself immediately is probably gonna be (54:50 - 54:56)
good taboo Coco's speed is like better (54:53 - 54:59)
than pretty much anything else in the (54:56 - 55:00)
format like I can't think of a single (54:59 - 55:03)
Pokemon that is used that really out (55:00 - 55:07)
speeds it and speed is very important (55:03 - 55:10)
though having a Pokemon with a hundred (55:07 - 55:13)
and thirty base speed which is wild to (55:10 - 55:16)
begin with and then the fact that it (55:13 - 55:21)
sets up a terrain bonus that increases (55:16 - 55:24)
its already pretty strong same type (55:21 - 55:28)
attack bonus moves like that's pretty (55:24 - 55:32)
good both Gyarados and arcanine from (55:28 - 55:34)
Christopher's team the winner here both (55:32 - 55:37)
with intimidate I've watched right yeah (55:34 - 55:40)
that's why arcanine is the most used (55:37 - 55:42)
pokemon in the format is primarily (55:40 - 55:44)
because of intimidate Enders because (55:42 - 55:47)
arcanine has is kind of flexible in (55:44 - 55:49)
terms of (55:47 - 55:51)
a lot you can do a lot of things with (55:49 - 55:53)
that Pokemon yeah since black and white (55:51 - 55:56)
being at the National Championship for (55:53 - 55:59)
black and white seeing intimidate me (55:56 - 56:02)
used a lot they're seeing it being used (55:59 - 56:05)
a lot throughout every single tournament (56:02 - 56:08)
just seems like people really like that (56:05 - 56:11)
ability because well and really good (56:08 - 56:13)
like it yeah (56:11 - 56:15)
people probably hate that ability (56:13 - 56:17)
because it's everywhere I mean it's just (56:15 - 56:21)
kind of like the best ability to have in (56:17 - 56:24)
terms of doubles especially if there are (56:21 - 56:26)
a lot of physically attacking Pokemon in (56:24 - 56:28)
the format like that's one of the (56:26 - 56:30)
reasons why even though top of Koko has (56:28 - 56:32)
higher physical attack on Special Attack (56:30 - 56:34)
virtually every type of Koko you're (56:32 - 56:35)
gonna see is actually a special (56:34 - 56:37)
attacking one because it's like well I (56:35 - 56:39)
mean you can basically say any (56:37 - 56:41)
physically attacking Pokemon actually (56:39 - 56:43)
has half that attack because it's going (56:41 - 56:46)
to be struck by an intimidate the second (56:43 - 56:50)
it runs in yeah yeah the the nice thing (56:46 - 56:52)
about intimidate is it hits both of your (56:50 - 56:56)
opponents immediately right and you can (56:52 - 56:59)
swap in and out and every time you come (56:56 - 57:01)
back in with intimidate it hits again (56:59 - 57:04)
it's very free and it's very widespread (57:01 - 57:07)
I can say that if anybody wants my (57:04 - 57:10)
secret rare gar boater TCG card I'm (57:07 - 57:11)
sorry (57:10 - 57:14)
somebody's already claimed it it's yo (57:11 - 57:17)
cute it's got that gold border I missed (57:14 - 57:20)
most the most of the TCG stuff I do plan (57:17 - 57:22)
on rewatching it but will did you have (57:20 - 57:25)
anything TCG wise did you look over any (57:22 - 57:27)
of these cards or anything now now I (57:25 - 57:29)
haven't had a chance to look at it I got (57:27 - 57:35)
to focus on the other TCG that's taken (57:29 - 57:36)
up all my time man there's there's stuff (57:35 - 57:39)
going on there left and right yeah so (57:36 - 57:41)
the runner-up John Keller in the and the (57:39 - 57:44)
TCG was running a card I'm pretty (57:41 - 57:46)
familiar with and this card was still in (57:44 - 57:48)
the format when I was playing shaming (57:46 - 57:52)
e^x it has the ability set up when you (57:48 - 57:54)
play this Pokemon from your hand onto (57:52 - 57:57)
your bench you may draw cards until you (57:54 - 58:00)
have six cards in your hand any card in (57:57 - 58:03)
the TCG that lets you draw more cards or (58:00 - 58:05)
search from our cards is pretty valuable (58:03 - 58:08)
most there's so many exceptions in the (58:05 - 58:10)
TCG I would say that most supporter (58:08 - 58:12)
cards which you're allowed to play one (58:10 - 58:15)
of those cards to turn are extremely (58:12 - 58:19)
powerful usually you want to play one (58:15 - 58:22)
Supporter per turn now the the flaw to (58:19 - 58:24)
that is if you don't have a supporter to (58:22 - 58:27)
play you're almost not always but almost (58:24 - 58:29)
at somewhat of a disadvantage because (58:27 - 58:34)
the the pokemon TCG is all about going (58:29 - 58:36)
through your deck as fast as possible (58:34 - 58:39)
and finding exactly what you need so the (58:36 - 58:41)
great thing about Shaymin e^x is if you (58:39 - 58:45)
have a trainer card which you're allowed (58:41 - 58:47)
to play unlimited of those are great but (58:45 - 58:50)
not nearly as powerful as supporter (58:47 - 58:53)
cards so for example if you've already (58:50 - 58:55)
played a supporter of that turn and you (58:53 - 58:58)
didn't get what you needed you could (58:55 - 59:01)
play a trainer card and there are a (58:58 - 59:02)
couple of trainer cards that let you (59:01 - 59:04)
just search for Pokemon so you can play (59:02 - 59:06)
a trainer card search for shame in place (59:04 - 59:09)
Shaymin now Shaymin has the ability that (59:06 - 59:11)
lets you draw until you have six cards (59:09 - 59:15)
in your hand so in doing so you can fill (59:11 - 59:17)
back up your hand really great it's also (59:15 - 59:21)
really good if somebody plays an N and (59:17 - 59:24)
you're close to winning so let's say you (59:21 - 59:26)
have one prize and they have six prizes (59:24 - 59:28)
they play it and they get six cards you (59:26 - 59:30)
get one card so it's a really great way (59:28 - 59:33)
of filling back up your hand and using a (59:30 - 59:36)
trainer card to ultimately get what is a (59:33 - 59:39)
supporter type ability which is (59:36 - 59:44)
refilling your hand and then for poured (59:39 - 59:49)
who is the winner he play garbo derp and (59:44 - 59:51)
there there are two different types he (59:49 - 59:54)
uses but one of them specifically has (59:51 - 59:58)
the ability which is if this Pokemon has (59:54 - 60:00)
a Pokemon tool card attached to it each (59:58 - 60:02)
Pokemon in play in each player's hand (60:00 - 60:05)
and each player's discard pile has no (60:02 - 60:09)
abilities except for garbodor ability so (60:05 - 60:10)
what it really does is it shutdowns (60:09 - 60:14)
everyone else's abilities which is (60:10 - 60:17)
critical especially if (60:14 - 60:20)
rest of your cards in play have no (60:17 - 60:22)
abilities which seems to be the case (60:20 - 60:25)
since their main card was grandpa GX (60:22 - 60:28)
which doesn't have any abilities but (60:25 - 60:29)
shutting that if your opponent's deck is (60:28 - 60:31)
very focused on abilities you're (60:29 - 60:33)
shutting all those abilities down and (60:31 - 60:35)
not hurting yourself because you're not (60:33 - 60:37)
dependent on abilities and that was your (60:35 - 60:40)
winning deck so there you guys go there (60:37 - 60:43)
was some TCG talk I know a couple of you (60:40 - 60:45)
have been asking for it will and I used (60:43 - 60:47)
to play so regularly we haven't played (60:45 - 60:51)
recently but I'm still familiar with (60:47 - 60:53)
what these cards do yep just wait till I (60:51 - 60:54)
move to Milwaukee (60:53 - 60:56)
we'll get back on that pony also the (60:54 - 60:58)
great thing about the pokemon TCG is (60:56 - 61:01)
even if you've only played for like one (60:58 - 61:06)
format cycle the TCG is so it's it's so (61:01 - 61:09)
similar to the video game in the aspect (61:06 - 61:13)
of while you made get different pokemon (61:09 - 61:15)
with different moves the abilities that (61:13 - 61:17)
exist in the game just like the video (61:15 - 61:21)
game are still extremely similar like (61:17 - 61:24)
the Shaymin card or a like garb order or (61:21 - 61:27)
in the past I want to say it was (61:24 - 61:28)
vileplume that did the same thing as (61:27 - 61:32)
garb order wear or something similar (61:28 - 61:34)
almost every single garbo order card has (61:32 - 61:37)
the ability to shut down either items or (61:34 - 61:39)
tools or abilities it shuts down (61:37 - 61:43)
something so even though we stepped away (61:39 - 61:45)
from the format you can look at these (61:43 - 61:47)
cards and go oh this garbodor is just (61:45 - 61:50)
like vileplume from x set or oh this (61:47 - 61:53)
Shaymin card is exactly like the Shaymin (61:50 - 61:56)
card from 10 years ago they just changed (61:53 - 61:58)
they just changed a couple things except (61:56 - 62:00)
for anything that they identified that (61:58 - 62:02)
was clearly broken right because there's (62:00 - 62:04)
like a Machop card out there that's an (62:02 - 62:06)
older Machop card where it was like (62:04 - 62:08)
anything that is a basic it doesn't even (62:06 - 62:10)
have to attack it's an automatic (62:08 - 62:13)
knockout and you know in a format where (62:10 - 62:15)
it was all X's and G X's that are all (62:13 - 62:18)
basics anyways you can't have that (62:15 - 62:21)
because that just becomes unfair a lot (62:18 - 62:23)
of trainer cards are extremely similar (62:21 - 62:25)
like professor Sycamore is just like (62:23 - 62:28)
Professor juniper and has existed since (62:25 - 62:30)
black and white they (62:28 - 62:33)
continue to print and make that card (62:30 - 62:38)
let's do a couple emails here you can (62:33 - 62:41)
shoot those emails over to SBJ at pkmn (62:38 - 62:44)
cast calm or you can go to pokemon (62:41 - 62:48)
podcast comm and hit the contact button (62:44 - 62:52)
first email is from Michael hey I am (62:48 - 62:55)
Michael from Southington Connecticut and (62:52 - 62:57)
first I wanted to say how much I love (62:55 - 63:01)
the podcast it's great second question (62:57 - 63:03)
is or well first wasn't really a (63:01 - 63:06)
question but second question in is if (63:03 - 63:08)
you could be any Pokemon type based on (63:06 - 63:11)
your personality what type would you be (63:08 - 63:14)
Michael I think we've had this question (63:11 - 63:16)
before right and I made some joke about (63:14 - 63:17)
that (63:16 - 63:22)
my soul is ice-cold I'll do a different (63:17 - 63:25)
answer um is it though Travis I've known (63:22 - 63:29)
you for so long and you were (63:25 - 63:29)
maple maybe you are just an ya try to (63:30 - 63:37)
try to think of it I am nothing I mean I (63:32 - 63:40)
do think that is a decent answer given (63:37 - 63:42)
that I am NOT a very I would say you're (63:40 - 63:44)
a caring person I do I do care for (63:42 - 63:47)
people but but like I don't also when I (63:44 - 63:50)
think is my family I think of like rude (63:47 - 63:53)
people or people that are very selfish (63:50 - 63:55)
or self-centered and I don't feel like (63:53 - 63:58)
you are rude selfish or self-centered (63:55 - 64:01)
well thank you maybe and maybe instead I (63:58 - 64:05)
would be something like maybe then a (64:01 - 64:09)
ground-type because I tend to because (64:05 - 64:11)
we're what I was getting at is that like (64:09 - 64:13)
I don't socialize very much (64:11 - 64:17)
okay I'll stick underground and be (64:13 - 64:19)
hanging out by myself (64:17 - 64:20)
you and I had a conversation recently (64:19 - 64:23)
like you know the fact that I talked to (64:20 - 64:25)
you too every week is like more than I (64:23 - 64:29)
talked to like any of my like any of my (64:25 - 64:31)
friend groups and like for some people (64:29 - 64:32)
that would be like you only talk to your (64:31 - 64:34)
friends once a week that's wild for me (64:32 - 64:37)
it's like wow once a week that's a lot (64:34 - 64:40)
of time with anybody yeah yeah and I (64:37 - 64:46)
mean like that's I I tend to be a bit of (64:40 - 64:50)
an isolated person so maybe ground fits (64:46 - 64:52)
my tendency to sort of go underground (64:50 - 64:55)
socially okay I'd have to say grass type (64:52 - 64:58)
because I love nature (64:55 - 65:01)
cuz you love being dirty yes I love (64:58 - 65:05)
rolling in filth that exactly me that's (65:01 - 65:08)
why I love grass type you see now I'm (65:05 - 65:10)
questioning your guys's personality (65:08 - 65:14)
choices cuz besides like running outside (65:10 - 65:17)
and like being out in parks on dirt (65:14 - 65:20)
trails yeah okay continue so you're (65:17 - 65:22)
you're not a you're not a sidewalk (65:20 - 65:23)
Runner is that what you're saying (65:22 - 65:26)
I only when necessary but also right (65:23 - 65:31)
remember where I live literally inside a (65:26 - 65:34)
park cuz I love being surrounded by (65:31 - 65:37)
trees and grass and animals and nature (65:34 - 65:39)
okay good answer (65:37 - 65:42)
I would probably say that (65:39 - 65:46)
I'm a fire-type because I feel like any (65:42 - 65:47)
time I have a conversation with people (65:46 - 65:51)
it becomes an argument or a debate (65:47 - 65:55)
I disagree so true (65:51 - 65:57)
and I'm pretty passionate about what I (65:55 - 66:01)
believe in or what my upon the garbage (65:57 - 66:04)
opinions you have yeah yeah and yeah I (66:01 - 66:05)
would say that's a very fiery (66:04 - 66:09)
personality yeah fired dark because you (66:05 - 66:10)
also cheat in your argument (66:09 - 66:16)
I don't know that ever you will never (66:10 - 66:17)
admit when you're wrong I just agree to (66:16 - 66:20)
this the framework you changed the (66:17 - 66:21)
framework mmm (66:20 - 66:25)
listen back to that to that top 10 (66:21 - 66:28)
Pokemon episode where everyone was (66:25 - 66:36)
saying no on the night I have a more (66:28 - 66:38)
recent example we were having a (66:36 - 66:40)
discussion and Steve said name a fan (66:38 - 66:42)
campaign that was ever successful and I (66:40 - 66:45)
like literally posted him a web page yes (66:42 - 66:46)
and campaign that was successful to (66:45 - 66:49)
bringing it and his response to my (66:46 - 66:51)
posting a direct answer to what he said (66:49 - 66:55)
was well those games sucked anyways (66:51 - 66:55)
while that was true I didn't say prove (66:56 - 67:05)
me wrong and name one successful thing I (67:00 - 67:07)
know that there was it was about (67:05 - 67:10)
crowdfunding games I think I know there (67:07 - 67:14)
have been ones but like and we don't (67:10 - 67:15)
need to talk about this (67:14 - 67:19)
hahahaha see see let's talk about (67:15 - 67:20)
something we can all agree on like (67:19 - 67:24)
politics which ironically we do all (67:20 - 67:26)
agree on which is funny (67:24 - 67:29)
Jeffery Wrightson hello I'm a really (67:26 - 67:32)
long time listener like before episode a (67:29 - 67:34)
hundred listener first time writing in (67:32 - 67:36)
because the internet is complicated as a (67:34 - 67:39)
fan of the podcast and hoenn being my (67:36 - 67:42)
favorite region I was wondering if you (67:39 - 67:44)
could make an episode where the main (67:42 - 67:46)
topic was everything positive about 3rd (67:44 - 67:49)
gen my fellow 3rd Jenners will agree (67:46 - 67:51)
that there are a lot of third gen hate (67:49 - 67:53)
but I get over it because everyone is (67:51 - 67:55)
not the same and you guys are extremely (67:53 - 67:59)
likeable yes even you will it could be a (67:55 - 68:02)
good starting point for every new third (67:59 - 68:04)
generation fan listening to your podcast (68:02 - 68:07)
since they are in a world of hurt again (68:04 - 68:08)
really a lot what really love what (68:07 - 68:11)
you're doing episode 69 is my favorite I (68:08 - 68:13)
also love the entire crew keep up the (68:11 - 68:14)
good work (68:13 - 68:17)
the only Jeffery in Canada like the (68:14 - 68:19)
toys-r-us Jeffery wine I want to pull (68:17 - 68:22)
back the curtain real quick pull back (68:19 - 68:32)
the curtain that will just said which is (68:22 - 68:35)
that if someone's name is Jeffery they (68:32 - 68:39)
have to be the giraffe from Toys R Us (68:35 - 68:42)
pull back there can't be anyone else (68:39 - 68:45)
ignore the man behind the curtain (68:42 - 68:47)
pulling back the curtain RAF in this (68:45 - 68:50)
case the only reason Travis is moving to (68:47 - 68:53)
Canada is because Canada has no Travis (68:50 - 68:56)
is living there right yeah I need to be (68:53 - 68:59)
the only one right right ok glad we're (68:56 - 69:01)
glad we establish this how about this (68:59 - 69:03)
how about I in regards hold on well hold (69:01 - 69:05)
on one sec ago how about instead of (69:03 - 69:07)
doing a whole episode which we we could (69:05 - 69:10)
do but no promises on that to satisfy (69:07 - 69:12)
the need of this question why don't we (69:10 - 69:15)
all say one good thing about generation (69:12 - 69:17)
3 right now (69:15 - 69:17)
i-i-i i'm thinking i can i this isn't a (69:24 - 69:30)
silence of like oh i can't think of a (69:28 - 69:31)
single thing but i'm just trying to (69:30 - 69:33)
think of what the i can think of a few (69:31 - 69:35)
things in trying to narrow it down i (69:33 - 69:37)
could think I can think of a couple i'll (69:35 - 69:39)
get the easy one out of the way gen3 (69:37 - 69:42)
introduced double battles which i think (69:39 - 69:45)
is one of my favorite ways to battle (69:42 - 69:49)
like i think i think the format should (69:45 - 69:52)
stay (69:49 - 69:55)
I think that the VGC format should say (69:52 - 69:58)
double battles I think that is the best (69:55 - 70:01)
way to competitively experience that (69:58 - 70:05)
format and even though I complain that (70:01 - 70:07)
we see a lot of the same and similar (70:05 - 70:11)
Pokemon in a double battle format I (70:07 - 70:14)
would fear that there would be less (70:11 - 70:16)
variety and it would be less (70:14 - 70:19)
entertaining to watch in a single battle (70:16 - 70:23)
format and therefore while I still enjoy (70:19 - 70:27)
the single battles double battles is my (70:23 - 70:29)
preferred and that was introduced in (70:27 - 70:32)
generation 3 III just I'm just gonna say (70:29 - 70:35)
that the Eevee and IV system well it (70:32 - 70:37)
gets a lot of track like it gets people (70:35 - 70:39)
talked trash about how complicated it is (70:37 - 70:42)
and I agree with them I think it's it's (70:39 - 70:47)
a heck of a lot better than the system (70:42 - 70:51)
in generation 1 & 2 if just like look up (70:47 - 70:57)
the formula it takes to determine V like (70:51 - 71:01)
the base HP stat for generations 1 & 2 (70:57 - 71:07)
and you'll never talk yeah well I guess (71:01 - 71:09)
it's bad in in it's still bad in the (71:07 - 71:12)
Eevee and IV system but it's like the (71:09 - 71:15)
all of the math is sort of backgrounded (71:12 - 71:17)
whereas if you really wanted to figure (71:15 - 71:21)
out how to breed like a perfect Pokemon (71:17 - 71:23)
in in Gen 2 you had to sort of pay (71:21 - 71:25)
attention to a lot of that whereas (71:23 - 71:27)
generation 3 and on with the Eevee and (71:25 - 71:30)
IV system there were sort of even though (71:27 - 71:32)
there was sort of complicated math going (71:30 - 71:33)
on in the background there was like (71:32 - 71:35)
easier math that you could do to just (71:33 - 71:38)
figure out what you needed to do and I (71:35 - 71:41)
think that's a solid move forward so I (71:38 - 71:44)
was going to say in gym it's a good (71:41 - 71:46)
pok√©mon just a lot of good pok√©mon World (71:44 - 71:49)
pok√©mon gen 3 this message is from Alex (71:46 - 71:52)
from Spokane Washington (71:49 - 71:55)
hi spj and crew with the direct last (71:52 - 71:57)
week you can see how behind we are with (71:55 - 72:00)
you miss the best moment for me was when (71:57 - 72:02)
they announced gold and silver for the (72:00 - 72:04)
3ds because I started out playing (72:02 - 72:05)
Pokemon with Generation (72:04 - 72:08)
and missed gold and silver and for some (72:05 - 72:10)
reason missed the remix so I am very (72:08 - 72:12)
excited to play the original games but I (72:10 - 72:15)
was wondering what are the three best (72:12 - 72:17)
and worst things about gold and silver I (72:15 - 72:20)
actually did not plan for these emails (72:17 - 72:24)
to be backing back back and which if any (72:20 - 72:27)
of you guys plan on getting and which (72:24 - 72:29)
starter would you pick I want to pick (72:27 - 72:31)
cyndaquil thank you guys for the show (72:29 - 72:32)
keep up the good work (72:31 - 72:36)
PS I am from Spokane oh there you go ah (72:32 - 72:39)
Alex so we're just talking about flat (72:36 - 72:42)
Gen 2 here not heartgold so yeah I would (72:39 - 72:45)
assume it was flat gem - uh big (72:42 - 72:46)
complaint right off the bat (72:45 - 72:49)
no running shoes your walk in that (72:46 - 72:51)
entire game level until you get the bike (72:49 - 72:53)
I'm gonna remind everyone you can't use (72:51 - 72:56)
the bike inside buildings and you're (72:53 - 73:01)
still walking really slow and it's so me (72:56 - 73:06)
Wow it just went yeah did you known they (73:01 - 73:09)
first appeared in Gen 2 right none that (73:06 - 73:10)
is correct yeah yeah there you go (73:09 - 73:15)
that's complaint right there I think as (73:10 - 73:18)
a kid I loved on the I thought that I (73:15 - 73:21)
think unknown actually are what caused (73:18 - 73:24)
me to stop playing pokemon gold is it (73:21 - 73:26)
because I would open up my safe file (73:24 - 73:28)
right now I would be in whatever that (73:26 - 73:31)
ruins was ruins of alph where the you (73:28 - 73:36)
know unknown are and yeah I love them so (73:31 - 73:38)
much because as a kid is they had this (73:36 - 73:40)
weird air of mystery around them that (73:38 - 73:43)
I'd yeah really fascinating um I agree I (73:40 - 73:47)
think in it are we just each naming one (73:43 - 73:48)
bad things who don't each have to come (73:47 - 73:52)
up with yeah sister 3 no if I came with (73:48 - 73:56)
three I would say my main complaint (73:52 - 74:02)
about Gen 2 would probably be the kind (73:56 - 74:05)
of shoddy time travel training thing it (74:02 - 74:09)
was cool to make it so that you could (74:05 - 74:11)
trade back and forth between gold and (74:09 - 74:16)
silver and red and blue but it was kind (74:11 - 74:19)
of pointless because you could only (74:16 - 74:21)
trade pok√©mon that you could already get (74:19 - 74:25)
in that first generation so it was like (74:21 - 74:27)
such a hassle to be like oh I guess I (74:25 - 74:30)
have to take all these new moves off of (74:27 - 74:32)
this Pokemon before I can trade it back (74:30 - 74:34)
and it should have just been as they (74:32 - 74:37)
figured out later on in games a one-way (74:34 - 74:40)
transaction to just trade up to gold and (74:37 - 74:41)
silver so you don't have to make all (74:40 - 74:43)
these Pokemon in gold and silver that (74:41 - 74:46)
you could trade you could that could (74:43 - 74:49)
exist in red and blue so that you could (74:46 - 74:50)
get your red and blue Pokemon enough to (74:49 - 74:52)
generation to I have a good thing and a (74:50 - 74:54)
bad thing good thing day and night cycle (74:52 - 74:58)
bad thing is when that game came out as (74:54 - 75:03)
a kid I didn't get off school until 3 I (74:58 - 75:06)
get I had to do all my homework before I (75:03 - 75:08)
could do anything else for the rest of (75:06 - 75:09)
the night which I think in retrospect (75:08 - 75:11)
was probably the right thing for my (75:09 - 75:13)
parents to do because (75:11 - 75:15)
once my all my homework was done I was (75:13 - 75:16)
free for the rest of the night but (75:15 - 75:18)
normally when that hit it was nighttime (75:16 - 75:22)
and golden silver so I rarely ever saw (75:18 - 75:26)
the daytime unless it was me playing on (75:22 - 75:28)
a weekend so that was kind of a (75:26 - 75:30)
complaint yeah but I mean that's kind of (75:28 - 75:32)
good it just changed the clock on your (75:30 - 75:35)
gameboy color but that would be yeah (75:32 - 75:38)
that would be I not if you changed it (75:35 - 75:40)
once and kept it consistent (75:38 - 75:43)
I would so I would say I mean I realize (75:40 - 75:45)
this is the thing that everyone says so (75:43 - 75:49)
I'll expand on it a little bit the just (75:45 - 75:50)
sheer amount of content in that (75:49 - 75:54)
generation is staggering compared to (75:50 - 75:56)
virtually any other generation of (75:54 - 75:58)
Pokemon what I will you know people talk (75:56 - 76:00)
about the post game which is incredible (75:58 - 76:02)
what I will add to that though is that (76:00 - 76:06)
not only is it just a mountain of game (76:02 - 76:09)
for you to play but it's also (76:06 - 76:13)
simultaneously the best paced pokemon (76:09 - 76:16)
game it's not like it's so much content (76:13 - 76:18)
because it takes you 20 hours to go from (76:16 - 76:23)
badge 2 to 3 or whatever it's it's a lot (76:18 - 76:27)
of content and it moves quickly in such (76:23 - 76:29)
a way that like whenever I say something (76:27 - 76:31)
like this and I'm just doing this to (76:29 - 76:35)
preempt tweets I know I'll get whenever (76:31 - 76:38)
I say that a game a certain game in the (76:35 - 76:40)
Pokemon series is paced well or isn't (76:38 - 76:41)
paced well I get I often get a lot of (76:40 - 76:43)
tweets saying like well I like to grind (76:41 - 76:46)
and I like I like spending time leveling (76:43 - 76:49)
up my Pokemon and it's like yes every (76:46 - 76:51)
game allows you to do that and that can (76:49 - 76:55)
be a fun experience however (76:51 - 76:59)
when a game forces you to slow down when (76:55 - 77:01)
it when a game introduces an area whose (76:59 - 77:03)
explicit purpose is to just slow down (77:01 - 77:06)
the action of the game I don't see that (77:03 - 77:10)
as anything but bad in well I should be (77:06 - 77:13)
clear when it's only purpose is to make (77:10 - 77:15)
something feel longer you can you can (77:13 - 77:18)
slow something down because you have you (77:15 - 77:20)
want to have some sort of emotional or (77:18 - 77:21)
story effect behind it to make a place (77:20 - 77:26)
feel sort of grueling and that can add a (77:21 - 77:28)
character to a location but when the (77:26 - 77:30)
developers just want to slow you down (77:28 - 77:32)
because they want their game to feel (77:30 - 77:36)
longer for weird marketing reasons I (77:32 - 77:39)
find that terrible game design and I (77:36 - 77:42)
don't think you really see as much of (77:39 - 77:45)
that in generation 2 as you see in some (77:42 - 77:46)
of the other pok√©mon generations so I (77:45 - 77:49)
think Pokemon I think generation 2 is (77:46 - 77:51)
like the best paced you know generation (77:49 - 77:53)
you know what was really untalked about (77:51 - 77:56)
about Sun and Moon is no one really (77:53 - 77:58)
mentioned that it was the first Pokemon (77:56 - 78:02)
game with side quests and they're not (77:58 - 78:05)
wha-what do you mean that like the like (78:02 - 78:08)
when you go into a town there's in every (78:05 - 78:11)
single town there's at least one person (78:08 - 78:15)
that is like hey show me a drift loom or (78:11 - 78:19)
are as true hey show me a row Bombay and (78:15 - 78:23)
in reality that's the first time we got (78:19 - 78:26)
side quests in a Pokemon game am I am I (78:23 - 78:28)
wrong and there have been people who (78:26 - 78:32)
have said I will trade you my X for your (78:28 - 78:34)
why that's true had to go and catch it (78:32 - 78:38)
and then if you wanted to but they are (78:34 - 78:40)
making it more prominent that's true (78:38 - 78:42)
right so you could also argue that the (78:40 - 78:44)
characters that collect certain items (78:42 - 78:46)
are sort of like side quests like you (78:44 - 78:49)
know give me a big mushroom and I'll (78:46 - 78:52)
give you money like and that is the (78:49 - 78:55)
Eevee trainers to get the Eevee Olight (78:52 - 78:58)
is what is it called for the Z evz oh (78:55 - 79:01)
yeah yeah I was just thinking of that (78:58 - 79:03)
because when you say like I agree with (79:01 - 79:07)
you 100% Travis if there is an area in a (79:03 - 79:09)
Pokemon game where all it's meant (79:07 - 79:11)
is for you to be there and battle wild (79:09 - 79:13)
Pokemon over and over until you hit a (79:11 - 79:15)
certain level so you can continue on I (79:13 - 79:19)
agree that that is a real turnoff to the (79:15 - 79:23)
to the game and as as me because I (79:19 - 79:25)
recently went back to black and white (79:23 - 79:27)
too like three weeks ago and the big (79:25 - 79:32)
turn-off for me was I had all had six (79:27 - 79:35)
Pokemon and most of them were really (79:32 - 79:39)
under leveled and I just wanted to (79:35 - 79:43)
progress in the game and it was hard for (79:39 - 79:46)
me to do that because these Pokemon were (79:43 - 79:48)
under level and I had to sit and cave (79:46 - 79:49)
and grind for that (79:48 - 79:52)
whereas if and the reason the reason (79:49 - 79:54)
that's the case is because I I banked (79:52 - 79:56)
almost all my Pokemon and then because I (79:54 - 79:57)
banked it I couldn't bring them back (79:56 - 80:00)
over and blah blah blah but if I would (79:57 - 80:03)
have just had the six starting Pokemon (80:00 - 80:05)
at the game and I would have went (80:03 - 80:07)
through naturally for the most part (80:05 - 80:08)
they'd be over leveled like the iron (80:07 - 80:12)
most Pokemon games but then I came to (80:08 - 80:15)
thinking if Pokemon wants you to grind (80:12 - 80:18)
why aren't they giving you side quests (80:15 - 80:21)
like most other role-playing games do (80:18 - 80:24)
and whether or not the side quests are (80:21 - 80:26)
good that's a good or bad that's a whole (80:24 - 80:29)
nother conversation but like to send you (80:26 - 80:32)
to a certain area to do a quest which in (80:29 - 80:36)
terms gets your reward but also in terms (80:32 - 80:38)
forces you to level up your Pokemon (80:36 - 80:40)
maybe one or two levels along the way (80:38 - 80:41)
that you probably wouldn't have been (80:40 - 80:44)
doing because it's off the beaten path (80:41 - 80:48)
back path is it's there's value to that (80:44 - 80:50)
without making you feel like you're just (80:48 - 80:54)
grinding definitely I think another good (80:50 - 80:55)
thing about gold and silver this would (80:54 - 80:59)
be my last good thing is that they take (80:55 - 81:01)
the original pokedex and they expand on (80:59 - 81:04)
to that whether that's like politoed or (81:01 - 81:08)
bellossom you talking with split (81:04 - 81:12)
evolutionary chains know just how some (81:08 - 81:13)
Pokemon like there's a connection (81:12 - 81:15)
between the two pokedex numbers (81:13 - 81:17)
I guess bellossom and and politoed are (81:15 - 81:20)
the ones I'm thinking of Gen 4 does that (81:17 - 81:23)
even better with like make mortar and (81:20 - 81:29)
Weavile and elective ah electivire but (81:23 - 81:33)
then you get to like Gen 5 and Gen 6 and (81:29 - 81:37)
Gen 7 and they don't really connect back (81:33 - 81:40)
to the first four games does that make (81:37 - 81:42)
sense yeah I see what you're saying (81:40 - 81:45)
there yeah it makes sense I I happen to (81:42 - 81:46)
disagree because I think the best thing (81:45 - 81:48)
about Gen 5 is that it's almost like a (81:46 - 81:51)
standalone title but gen 3 so what that (81:48 - 81:54)
makes me along is right is I want to (81:51 - 81:56)
have a new gen where they have like (81:54 - 82:00)
further evolutions of Gen 5 Pokemon how (81:56 - 82:02)
about that it'll take place till gen 10 (82:00 - 82:07)
I was I was thinking Ben 10 10 10 - oh (82:02 - 82:09)
no I was thinking of this mostly because (82:07 - 82:13)
of Pokemon go because I'm catching I'm (82:09 - 82:15)
catching more Magnemite because of (82:13 - 82:16)
Magnezone and I'm catching a more (82:15 - 82:18)
electabuzz because of electivire and I'm (82:16 - 82:22)
catching murkrow because of honcho and (82:18 - 82:25)
I'm thinking all those pok√©mon are in (82:22 - 82:28)
generation 4 and generation 3 is for the (82:25 - 82:31)
most part pretty standalone mm-hmm and (82:28 - 82:35)
generation 5 is standalone (82:31 - 82:37)
generations six is standalone and (82:35 - 82:40)
generations seven is pretty standalone I (82:37 - 82:42)
mean you could a lowland variance really (82:40 - 82:45)
they're kind of their own thing but (82:42 - 82:47)
generation four does this great thing of (82:45 - 82:51)
going back to generation one and we (82:47 - 82:54)
haven't seen that since I mean you see (82:51 - 82:56)
the hell I mean I would argue that a (82:54 - 82:59)
lowland forms are a huge attempt of that (82:56 - 83:03)
not insignificant I I just (82:59 - 83:08)
I tend to like games because pokemons (83:03 - 83:10)
trajectory as a franchise is just an (83:08 - 83:14)
arrow point it's just a logarithmic (83:10 - 83:20)
chart just going increasingly towards (83:14 - 83:23)
complexity um the games just get more (83:20 - 83:24)
and more complicated because you had (83:23 - 83:25)
more and more features and more and more (83:24 - 83:29)
Pokemon so I tend to enjoy the titles (83:25 - 83:34)
where you you don't need to worry about (83:29 - 83:37)
previous entries not because I don't (83:34 - 83:39)
know the content of previous entries of (83:37 - 83:40)
course I do because I've played all of (83:39 - 83:43)
them but if I'm trying to introduce (83:40 - 83:46)
anyone to the franchise like I'm not (83:43 - 83:48)
gonna even though Gen 4 is one of my (83:46 - 83:51)
most appreciated generations I'm not (83:48 - 83:54)
gonna give Gen 4 am I gonna give diamond (83:51 - 83:56)
and pearl to someone who hasn't played (83:54 - 83:58)
Pokemon before because like they're not (83:56 - 84:00)
gonna appreciate the things that are (83:58 - 84:02)
happening with like electivire or (84:00 - 84:05)
whatever um there are certainly games (84:02 - 84:07)
that that aim to beast that doesn't (84:05 - 84:09)
necessarily mean like all the games that (84:07 - 84:10)
are aiming to be standalone titles are (84:09 - 84:12)
my favorites and all the ones that (84:10 - 84:15)
aren't are my least favorite but I mean (84:12 - 84:19)
I do if given the choice I I would (84:15 - 84:21)
prefer a game feel like it can stand or (84:19 - 84:23)
it under its own weight I'm not saying (84:21 - 84:25)
that every Pokemon needs an evolution (84:23 - 84:27)
down the line actually quite the (84:25 - 84:29)
opposite I think pok√©mon like Lapras and (84:27 - 84:34)
tauros like I think they stand so solid (84:29 - 84:37)
on their own but Pokemon that don't get (84:34 - 84:41)
a lot of love or you could see potential (84:37 - 84:44)
in like something like a corsola it'd be (84:41 - 84:46)
really cool if like hey generation 8 (84:44 - 84:49)
we got a Corsa LEvolution not only to (84:46 - 84:52)
like give a couple other Pokemon (84:49 - 84:55)
evolutions but to also tie those pokedex (84:52 - 84:58)
a--'s together in some way like how I (84:55 - 84:59)
felt (84:58 - 85:02)
generation 1 in generation 4 really tied (84:59 - 85:05)
those evolution like those Dex's (85:02 - 85:09)
together you know way maybe I'm just (85:05 - 85:13)
overthinking yeah I mean I I get your I (85:09 - 85:16)
get your perspective I just (85:13 - 85:17)
I just have different preference yeah (85:16 - 85:19)
yeah yeah now let's do one more email (85:17 - 85:21)
here this is Derek from Los Angeles (85:19 - 85:22)
California (85:21 - 85:26)
hey all it's Derek from LA here or Derek (85:22 - 85:28)
is a gunner on slack I have two (85:26 - 85:29)
questions for everyone (85:28 - 85:31)
well while having conversation with my (85:29 - 85:34)
wife while we were on the Pokemon go (85:31 - 85:39)
pok√© how most of the main series games (85:34 - 85:41)
are based on real-life locations black (85:39 - 85:44)
and white in New York X&Y France Sun and (85:41 - 85:47)
Moon Hawaii etc and we got to talking (85:44 - 85:50)
about which geographical locations would (85:47 - 85:52)
be awesome for Pokemon games but which (85:50 - 85:54)
city or country do you think would make (85:52 - 85:56)
a great inspiration for the next Pokemon (85:54 - 85:58)
game second question I heard some of the (85:56 - 86:01)
hosts making brief reference to ASMR (85:58 - 86:02)
throughout my time listening to the (86:01 - 86:04)
podcast it's such a different thing that (86:02 - 86:06)
I don't feel comfortable talking about (86:04 - 86:08)
it with people it's much easier to tell (86:06 - 86:12)
somebody I played play pokemon with then (86:08 - 86:16)
it is that I listen to ASMR anyways the (86:12 - 86:17)
references made me wonder is there (86:16 - 86:20)
anyone who on the podcast who listens (86:17 - 86:23)
thanks for being awesome (86:20 - 86:25)
Derek is there anyone who listens for (86:23 - 86:27)
ASMR yeah (86:25 - 86:29)
their name is Logan Jenkins they have a (86:27 - 86:32)
podcast called ASMR use guest list was (86:29 - 86:35)
discontinued I don't know I guess I have (86:32 - 86:39)
if you like ASMR or Pokemon or whatever (86:35 - 86:47)
I totally see the hesitation or the (86:39 - 86:50)
uncomfortableness in telling people and (86:47 - 86:53)
I personally I feel like I've gotten (86:50 - 86:58)
past that when I started meditating I (86:53 - 87:00)
thought it was (86:58 - 87:02)
I probably felt the same way you did (87:00 - 87:05)
about ASMR in the like Oh people are (87:02 - 87:06)
probably gonna think I'm really weird (87:05 - 87:10)
but then I mean when it comes down to it (87:06 - 87:13)
it's not weird for people to go to a gym (87:10 - 87:18)
and workout and enhance their body slash (87:13 - 87:21)
muscles in a way bang and bang clang (87:18 - 87:24)
well some would say clanging and banging (87:21 - 87:27)
so a meditation is really the same thing (87:24 - 87:29)
as working out your body except you're (87:27 - 87:33)
working out your mind and that's kind of (87:29 - 87:36)
how I got over that of like if somebody (87:33 - 87:39)
was to ever question my meditation I (87:36 - 87:43)
could easily give that reference point I (87:39 - 87:46)
don't know if there is one with ASMR or (87:43 - 87:50)
what it may or may not be similar to but (87:46 - 87:53)
I suppose though if you were to find a (87:50 - 87:56)
Harrison it would be very easy to (87:53 - 88:00)
explain that to people I mean one of my (87:56 - 88:02)
favorite things is to watch a youtube (88:00 - 88:03)
channel where a man just walks around (88:02 - 88:07)
dead malls so like we've all got our (88:03 - 88:11)
thing that's that's specific I should (88:07 - 88:12)
probably find going Hyper's but I should (88:11 - 88:14)
probably say that's the this is Dan Bell (88:12 - 88:17)
YouTube channel it's it's a man and he (88:14 - 88:19)
walks around malls that aren't doing (88:17 - 88:21)
very well and talks about them and it's (88:19 - 88:22)
like my favorite thing on the entire (88:21 - 88:25)
internet there is there's a point in (88:22 - 88:29)
time where this was years ago where I (88:25 - 88:32)
was very hesitant in telling people I (88:29 - 88:35)
hosted a Pokemon podcast but now I guess (88:32 - 88:38)
I just don't care yeah I'm in a similar (88:35 - 88:42)
spot because like and in a different way (88:38 - 88:45)
because when people ask me how I met my (88:42 - 88:49)
fiancee well first I say usually I'll (88:45 - 88:52)
just say oh we met over the Internet and (88:49 - 88:55)
then people will say like people well (88:52 - 88:59)
Broadmoor and then I say oh well uh like (88:55 - 89:02)
a dating app like OkCupid I said no I (88:59 - 89:04)
frequently co-host a podcast and she (89:02 - 89:07)
listens to the show and met me through (89:04 - 89:07)
that (89:07 - 89:10)
oh it's a show about well strap in (89:07 - 89:13)
because it's about this great franchise (89:10 - 89:14)
from (89:13 - 89:16)
you know the-the-the folks over in Japan (89:14 - 89:18)
are making really great video game (89:16 - 89:21)
content and one of those franchises is (89:18 - 89:24)
Pocket Monsters you see you've got these (89:21 - 89:25)
little creatures and they can shrink (89:24 - 89:28)
down to the size of something that you (89:25 - 89:30)
can fit in your pocket you can battle (89:28 - 89:32)
and trade them it's really fun it's (89:30 - 89:34)
really groovy and all the kids are (89:32 - 89:37)
digging this one CeCe but for you Travis (89:34 - 89:40)
it's even easier because of the success (89:37 - 89:42)
of Pokemon go I feel like if you were (89:40 - 89:44)
just to say oh it's a Pokemon podcast (89:42 - 89:47)
how many people downloaded Pokemon go (89:44 - 89:52)
like a hundred million or billion or a (89:47 - 89:55)
lot of pho a lot of folks I would be (89:52 - 89:56)
hard-pressed to find a person that (89:55 - 89:59)
hasn't heard of Pokemon go (89:56 - 90:02)
it's true well generally the people who (89:59 - 90:05)
if I say oh we met over the Internet (90:02 - 90:07)
usually younger people will be like oh (90:05 - 90:09)
cool like cuz they get that people can (90:07 - 90:11)
interact with each other online a lot (90:09 - 90:14)
but yeah but usually it's like an older (90:11 - 90:16)
person who's like oh well how does that (90:14 - 90:19)
work and I'd be like well do you know (90:16 - 90:22)
what a podcast is like alright then I (90:19 - 90:25)
have to like so it's a radio and radio a (90:22 - 90:28)
pre-recorded right and then and then (90:25 - 90:30)
they ask like oh well what's the show (90:28 - 90:30)
about (90:30 - 90:33)
and I have to be like well you know that (90:30 - 90:34)
little gameboy (90:33 - 90:36)
you bought me when I was a little kid (90:34 - 90:39)
and so and that's not true I would I got (90:36 - 90:41)
my gameboy from my parents and I was (90:39 - 90:43)
very grateful but like you have to it's (90:41 - 90:45)
it's it's a weird cyclical thing but (90:43 - 90:48)
I've done it so often now that it's just (90:45 - 90:51)
like I just the script just flies out of (90:48 - 90:55)
my mouth well do you have any hobbies (90:51 - 90:58)
slash interests in life that you were (90:55 - 91:03)
hesitant to tell people this program (90:58 - 91:03)
especially after recent things in my (91:03 - 91:11)
career ya know because people don't (91:08 - 91:14)
write people either don't understand (91:11 - 91:16)
that Pokemon is more than just a card (91:14 - 91:19)
game or more than just a pokemon go like (91:16 - 91:22)
they don't understand like how much more (91:19 - 91:25)
there is in everything that T PCI (91:22 - 91:30)
touches so they immediately whenever I (91:25 - 91:32)
say that I'm involved in Pokemon and (91:30 - 91:33)
stuff or even podcasting they like (91:32 - 91:37)
reduce it to the least component that (91:33 - 91:39)
they can think of that they can grasp in (91:37 - 91:42)
their own thinking and then they apply (91:39 - 91:44)
that to me rather than being open to (91:42 - 91:45)
saying oh what this is actually (91:44 - 91:48)
something larger or has greater (91:45 - 91:52)
influence they just can't grasp it so I (91:48 - 91:55)
yeah also you know I am the oldest (91:52 - 91:56)
person that plays Vanguard at my (91:55 - 92:02)
vanguard league I'm I don't know going (91:56 - 92:04)
back to Derek's question hesitant to (92:02 - 92:06)
tell people that they listen to ASMR and (92:04 - 92:08)
again I don't I don't know much about (92:06 - 92:11)
that that community your culture hobby (92:08 - 92:12)
or however (92:11 - 92:13)
it's classified I don't know much about (92:12 - 92:16)
it but I would imagine that there are (92:13 - 92:20)
just like any interest or hobby how (92:16 - 92:25)
niche or quirky or popular or non (92:20 - 92:28)
popular it is I am sure there is a forum (92:25 - 92:34)
or of subreddit or a community that you (92:28 - 92:39)
could probably go to and and ask how to (92:34 - 92:42)
explain it to people that may not know (92:39 - 92:46)
it or what's an easy way to express that (92:42 - 92:48)
that's an interest for you I think the (92:46 - 92:52)
added difficulty that this listener (92:48 - 92:54)
would have compared to the situation's (92:52 - 92:57)
we are describing is that ASMR as an (92:54 - 93:00)
experience is a physical one it's like a (92:57 - 93:03)
thing that your brain does when placed (93:00 - 93:06)
in front of certain stimuli and it's not (93:03 - 93:09)
a certain experience that everybody has (93:06 - 93:11)
so that's probably a difficult thing to (93:09 - 93:16)
like I I only barely can kind of feel (93:11 - 93:18)
weird things when ASMR is happening in (93:16 - 93:21)
my ears like I I'm not you know a very (93:18 - 93:23)
strong responder to that type of thing (93:21 - 93:24)
so I've never really been that (93:23 - 93:26)
interested in it so I can only barely (93:24 - 93:29)
understand it so I can imagine like if (93:26 - 93:34)
someone has never heard of it like what (93:29 - 93:37)
what do you mean what do you mean you (93:34 - 93:39)
know how sometimes when you're at the (93:37 - 93:41)
barber shop and then the back of your (93:39 - 93:43)
head starts to tingle like like it's (93:41 - 93:45)
probably just a weird it's it's probably (93:43 - 93:46)
a difficult thing to describe when it's (93:45 - 93:48)
not something everyone experiences (93:46 - 93:51)
whereas everybody is familiar with (93:48 - 93:53)
things that they enjoy so it's like (93:51 - 93:55)
easier for us to say I just like these (93:53 - 93:59)
Pokemon so I imagine it's more uh it's (93:55 - 94:01)
it's it would be more akin to like I (93:59 - 94:04)
don't know I I think it's it is a bit of (94:01 - 94:08)
a different category so I don't quite (94:04 - 94:09)
know how to do it but I think Steve (94:08 - 94:12)
you're right that probably someone's (94:09 - 94:14)
probably got it figured out someone's (94:12 - 94:16)
probably got an elevator pitch for ASMR (94:14 - 94:19)
figured out what one would hope uh well (94:16 - 94:21)
that'll that'll do it for emails if you (94:19 - 94:26)
have your own SBJ @pk men cast calm or (94:21 - 94:28)
hit the contact button I apologize if we (94:26 - 94:30)
haven't gotten to your email yet some of (94:28 - 94:32)
these emails from we're from early July (94:30 - 94:36)
and a gasps um we didn't say what what (94:32 - 94:38)
place we want a Pokemon game to be in (94:36 - 94:40)
the every Pokemon question actually (94:38 - 94:43)
email I would say I would say Iceland (94:40 - 94:45)
would be very amusing woo the land of (94:43 - 94:46)
Ice and Fire (94:45 - 94:51)
absolutely I would say I would want (94:46 - 94:56)
Australia and for there to be really big (94:51 - 94:58)
cities on one side really big cities on (94:56 - 95:01)
the other perth not included and there (94:58 - 95:04)
to be there to be there to be like a (95:01 - 95:07)
bullet train that goes between the two (95:04 - 95:10)
so really they're not even that in real (95:07 - 95:16)
life I would want it to like a plane (95:10 - 95:19)
yeah but you can have a train or (95:16 - 95:19)
something (95:19 - 95:22)
okay well the fantasy I suppose yeah so (95:19 - 95:25)
instead of like a Lola having four (95:22 - 95:28)
different fields generation two having (95:25 - 95:30)
two different fields it would more so (95:28 - 95:33)
resemble generation two and having the (95:30 - 95:35)
difference though is generation two (95:33 - 95:37)
you've already experienced that first (95:35 - 95:39)
feel like when you go back to Kanto (95:37 - 95:41)
you're like oh I've been here before but (95:39 - 95:42)
when you take if you were to have (95:41 - 95:44)
Australia and break it up into two (95:42 - 95:48)
quote-unquote regions or areas we taking (95:44 - 95:50)
that bullet train to the other side and (95:48 - 95:51)
I've never been to Australia so maybe (95:50 - 95:53)
actually in reality they're exactly the (95:51 - 95:56)
same but I I would imagine that (95:53 - 95:59)
Australian listeners would say no the (95:56 - 96:00)
other side is terrible compared to our (95:59 - 96:03)
side taking that train to the other side (96:00 - 96:09)
and then having almost more unique area (96:03 - 96:12)
and then being excited to go back to (96:09 - 96:14)
explore the rest of the first area or (96:12 - 96:16)
something like that that's gets at least (96:14 - 96:19)
what I would enjoy and then imagine all (96:16 - 96:21)
of the really (96:19 - 96:26)
like imagine how angry be people in New (96:21 - 96:28)
Zealand would be if New Zealand was just (96:26 - 96:33)
the post-game island all right Travis (96:28 - 96:37)
give us the Pokemon of the week our whoa (96:33 - 96:40)
what happened to my voice right there (96:37 - 96:43)
our Pokemon of the week this week is (96:40 - 96:48)
pelipper actually pretty commonly used (96:43 - 96:52)
in VGC 2017 because as it stands it's (96:48 - 96:55)
kind of the best option for setting up (96:52 - 97:00)
rain with its ability drizzle let's go (96:55 - 97:04)
to the move sets and sent in I'm trying (97:00 - 97:07)
to pick someone I don't know if we've (97:04 - 97:13)
featured a move set from Riley before no (97:07 - 97:15)
I don't know so I'm gonna do that one (97:13 - 97:18)
because I think we've featured all these (97:15 - 97:20)
other folks um it's going to be a (97:18 - 97:23)
pelipper with drizzle with the item damp (97:20 - 97:26)
rock which extends the length of the (97:23 - 97:31)
rain that drizzle sets up drizzle for (97:26 - 97:32)
those unawares and ability that sets up (97:31 - 97:36)
heavy rain when pelipper or any pokemon (97:32 - 97:39)
with it switches in on damp rock extends (97:36 - 97:40)
the number of turns for which that is (97:39 - 97:43)
the case with a calm nature and with the (97:40 - 97:46)
move set hurricane scald u-turn and (97:43 - 97:50)
roost you can tell that this oh sorry (97:46 - 97:54)
the Eevee spread is 252 and HP 252 and (97:50 - 97:56)
special defense and foreign defense you (97:54 - 98:00)
can tell this is a more defensive set so (97:56 - 98:03)
you're setting up rain for a couple (98:00 - 98:05)
reasons one because it increases the (98:03 - 98:08)
damage of your same type attack bonus (98:05 - 98:11)
scald but also gives you 100% accuracy (98:08 - 98:13)
on hurricane and then the other main (98:11 - 98:14)
reason is probably you're going to set (98:13 - 98:17)
it up with some teammates that can (98:14 - 98:20)
really utilize rain so maybe something (98:17 - 98:23)
that has thunder or if you're really (98:20 - 98:25)
going all out with the water types of (98:23 - 98:28)
common core for VGC teams is to pair it (98:25 - 98:29)
up with Golduck which i think we've (98:28 - 98:31)
talked about on the show before I think (98:29 - 98:35)
we featured Golduck a few months ago (98:31 - 98:37)
that can because it has swift swim can (98:35 - 98:40)
get off an incredibly powerful and very (98:37 - 98:43)
fast z move but just pull up around its (98:40 - 98:46)
own as Riley mentions you get same type (98:43 - 98:48)
attack bonus and scald with a nice (98:46 - 98:50)
chance to burn and actually same type (98:48 - 98:54)
attack bonus on hurricane which has 100% (98:50 - 98:58)
accuracy with drizzle and then you turn (98:54 - 98:59)
gives you the ability to do some damage (98:58 - 99:02)
and then swap out to something that can (98:59 - 99:05)
clean up a situation and then roost is (99:02 - 99:06)
there because you've already got so much (99:05 - 99:09)
HP and defense that getting half of it (99:06 - 99:11)
back is is going to be getting a lot of (99:09 - 99:16)
HP back so that is a more defensive (99:11 - 99:19)
version of it you could do other (99:16 - 99:22)
varieties like the one we recently saw (99:19 - 99:27)
in top 10 of the tournament isn't quite (99:22 - 99:30)
as defensive so I don't actually have (99:27 - 99:33)
the V's here but I can imagine by the (99:30 - 99:35)
fact that it's modest nature that I (99:33 - 99:38)
would be offensively invested and that's (99:35 - 99:40)
some of the same moves so scald (99:38 - 99:44)
hurricane but then protect and tailwind (99:40 - 99:47)
with focus sash as the held item because (99:44 - 99:49)
we're not investing in bulk (99:47 - 99:51)
like we were in the last set so you want (99:49 - 99:53)
to make sure you live a turn to set up (99:51 - 99:57)
tailwind which doubles the speed of all (99:53 - 100:00)
Pokemon on your side of the field so (99:57 - 100:03)
being able to have both rain benefit all (100:00 - 100:05)
of your Pokemon if they synergize (100:03 - 100:07)
somehow whether it be because you know (100:05 - 100:10)
they're like a grass pokemon that would (100:07 - 100:13)
be weak to fire and that fire weaknesses (100:10 - 100:16)
protected a little bit by the rain or (100:13 - 100:17)
because they have thunder and that gets (100:16 - 100:20)
a hundred percent accuracy in the rain (100:17 - 100:23)
or you know any any variety of reasons (100:20 - 100:25)
why rain would help and then tailwind (100:23 - 100:27)
doubling the speed of your Pokemon makes (100:25 - 100:30)
this variety of pelipper quite a good (100:27 - 100:33)
support pokemon that can still deal a (100:30 - 100:34)
decent amount of damage because of the (100:33 - 100:38)
offensive investment and the like 100% (100:34 - 100:41)
accuracy hurricane so yeah you sort of (100:38 - 100:43)
get two varieties they're almost both do (100:41 - 100:45)
they're kind of doing the same thing in (100:43 - 100:46)
that they're mostly there to setup rain (100:45 - 100:48)
for your other Pokemon to utilize (100:46 - 100:50)
but they're doing different things in (100:48 - 100:53)
that one is there to sort of stick (100:50 - 100:57)
around and really force the opposing (100:53 - 101:00)
team to take a lot of damage from its - (100:57 - 101:02)
same type of tack bonus moves even (101:00 - 101:04)
though you haven't invested offensively (101:02 - 101:07)
so there's that defensive pelipper and (101:04 - 101:09)
then the second one we read off is (101:07 - 101:11)
really more focused on making sure that (101:09 - 101:13)
tailwind gets off and then for however (101:11 - 101:16)
many turns it happens to survive after (101:13 - 101:20)
that deal a little bit of damage - does (101:16 - 101:24)
that make any sense yes yep so a shiny (101:20 - 101:28)
pelipper will be have green highlights (101:24 - 101:31)
instead of the blue highlights which (101:28 - 101:34)
we've had the debate of the the use of (101:31 - 101:37)
green and Chinese but this is this is (101:34 - 101:39)
one of the better uses of green pepper (101:37 - 101:42)
ler pelipper shares the same category (101:39 - 101:44)
with duck late-- they are both known as (101:42 - 101:47)
the waterer bird Pokemon and that's all (101:44 - 101:51)
the trivia you get Josh pretty (101:47 - 101:54)
short-sighted there it's like a Stewart (101:51 - 101:58)
great yeah well in the there you go for (101:54 - 102:00)
those that haven't wanted the troughs (101:58 - 102:03)
haven't watched the Sun and Moon anime (102:00 - 102:07)
Pokemon like Pikachu ride in Pella purrs (102:03 - 102:11)
mouth and Island eats them yeah I think (102:07 - 102:17)
like I do think that pelipper could (102:11 - 102:20)
easily swallow Pikachu if if needed (102:17 - 102:26)
well pelicans eat fish do they not yeah (102:20 - 102:26)
I do (102:26 - 102:30)
so what Pikachu is not a fish what's the (102:26 - 102:33)
difference though Mouse fish (102:30 - 102:36)
they both have tiny bones and flesh one (102:33 - 102:40)
uses gills to extract oxygen from water (102:36 - 102:45)
the other breathes air freely from the (102:40 - 102:46)
atmosphere (102:45 - 102:50)
fish have yes scales Pikachu's have (102:46 - 102:54)
skinned with fur mammal versus it would (102:50 - 102:55)
be it sounds like a mouse would be (102:54 - 102:58)
easier to eat than a fish yeah but not (102:55 - 103:01)
so easy to digest but how is it (102:58 - 103:03)
digesting its bones the fish's bones (103:01 - 103:06)
anyways I did not say bones don't put (103:03 - 103:09)
words in my mouth mr. fish yeah don't (103:06 - 103:11)
put words in my mouth let alone bones (103:09 - 103:15)
fish fish meat like bones are easy to (103:11 - 103:17)
digest for everybody except for human (103:15 - 103:21)
beings trust me dogs do it all the time (103:17 - 103:26)
fish meat fish muscle is much easier to (103:21 - 103:29)
digest then in a mammal muscle okay I've (103:26 - 103:32)
been meat so (103:29 - 103:34)
my sushi goes down so smooth but you got (103:32 - 103:37)
a cook that beef no thank you I do like (103:34 - 103:39)
eating raw beef okay have you ever had a (103:37 - 103:43)
sushi have you ever had a delicious like (103:39 - 103:49)
slice of Toro no historically good no I (103:43 - 103:51)
I can't eat anything that comes from the (103:49 - 103:56)
sea no no no you can't if you choose not (103:51 - 103:59)
to it's it's the smell alone that makes (103:56 - 104:00)
me want to gag (103:59 - 104:02)
why are you smelling your food why are (104:00 - 104:03)
you feeling food with your mouth why are (104:02 - 104:06)
you smelling your food food like 70 (104:03 - 104:08)
percent smell isn't that something that (104:06 - 104:11)
somebody said and then no one did (104:08 - 104:13)
research on and then so people just say (104:11 - 104:16)
it yeah like he was just any son of your (104:13 - 104:22)
man what was I gonna say oh just gotta (104:16 - 104:25)
expand your horizons speaking of the (104:22 - 104:29)

episodes we've watched there's only one (105:30 - 105:33)

Sophocles but some quick housecleaning (105:35 - 105:42)

helps with the search engine and other (106:47 - 106:52)
people finding the show and rankings and (106:49 - 106:55)
iTunes so just search for pkmn cast or (106:52 - 106:57)
it's super effective in iTunes or I (106:55 - 106:59)
think just Pokemon podcasts will also (106:57 - 107:01)
get you the first hit on the show so (106:59 - 107:04)
that would be really helpful and (107:01 - 107:04)
ro the final bit of news which i think (107:05 - 107:09)
is probably the most important is it's (107:07 - 107:10)
super effective we'll be celebrating (107:09 - 107:16)
seven years at the end of the month July (107:10 - 107:19)
29th right well yeah I my birthday yeah (107:16 - 107:20)
I think the show actually started July (107:19 - 107:26)
28th if I'm not mistaken or I don't (107:20 - 107:27)
remember which one went first (107:26 - 107:30)
something went live on July 28th I don't (107:27 - 107:31)
know if it was the website or the (107:30 - 107:33)
podcast I want to say it was the podcast (107:31 - 107:36)
and then on August 2nd the other one (107:33 - 107:38)
went up which I think was the website (107:36 - 107:42)
but I'm pretty sure on July 29th which (107:38 - 107:45)
is my birthday I'm gonna do something (107:42 - 107:48)
regarding live streaming / possible (107:45 - 107:52)
other live stuff and there are a couple (107:48 - 107:55)
things that I have that that could be (107:52 - 107:59)
done I have a way to stream GameCube (107:55 - 108:03)
games so possibly Pokemon Colosseum or (107:59 - 108:06)
Gale of Darkness were something I was (108:03 - 108:07)
thinking of because those are kind of (108:06 - 108:12)
story ish games I also have a copy of (108:07 - 108:16)
LeafGreen which would be kind of cool (108:12 - 108:18)
because I have the Gameboy player for (108:16 - 108:21)
the Gamecube I can get those Pokemon (108:18 - 108:26)
from leaf green to Sun and Moon whoa yes (108:21 - 108:31)
yeah day so that would be kind of cool (108:26 - 108:33)
especially since because I can transfer (108:31 - 108:35)
them over it would be cool to have (108:33 - 108:37)
community participation of naming (108:35 - 108:39)
Pokemon and catching pok√©mon and (108:37 - 108:41)
building a team and doing something of (108:39 - 108:45)
that sort I am NOT a fan of streaming (108:41 - 108:47)
anything emulated because while that may (108:45 - 108:51)
be easier I think it is important to be (108:47 - 108:53)
able to get those Pokemon to Sun and (108:51 - 108:56)
Moon and possibly out to viewers / (108:53 - 108:59)
listeners I think there's value to that (108:56 - 109:03)
so while we while we laughs and how (108:59 - 109:06)
terrible that transfer system is it can (109:03 - 109:09)
be done otherwise are there there are (109:06 - 109:11)
other Pokemon games that can be streamed (109:09 - 109:14)
too but I do want to do somewhat of (109:11 - 109:16)
celebration that day of seven years I (109:14 - 109:18)
think that's a long time and (109:16 - 109:21)
I think that would be your incorrect a (109:18 - 109:23)
century is a long time all right well (109:21 - 109:25)
let's cancel everything we'll see you (109:23 - 109:28)
guys in three more games good otherwise (109:25 - 109:32)
I think that's our episode thank you all (109:28 - 109:33)
for listening if you made it this far I (109:32 - 109:36)
know this was a longer episode for the (109:33 - 109:38)
amount of poke stuff we had but (109:36 - 109:40)
this has been another episode of the (109:38 - 109:44)
Pokemon podcast and we are super a fast (109:40 - 109:47)
food / secret ribs (109:44 - 109:57)
