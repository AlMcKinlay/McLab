Oh (0:12 - 0:14)
what's up everyone welcome to the 220 (0:20 - 0:28)
second episode of the Pokemon podcast (0:24 - 0:32)
222 can we talk about throwing up for a (0:28 - 0:36)
second no preferably not all right (0:32 - 0:38)
people have a bad reaction to the (0:36 - 0:42)
concept why no that's why it is a topic (0:38 - 0:44)
of discussion because it can you know (0:42 - 0:46)
you know why it's a topic of despair iya (0:44 - 0:48)
7e i can tell you why it's a topic of (0:46 - 0:52)
discussion because you said that the (0:48 - 0:54)
episode of seinfeld with the (0:52 - 0:56)
black-and-white cookie was not the (0:54 - 0:58)
episode of the seinfeld where he was (0:56 - 1:00)
bragging at how he hadn't thrown up in (0:58 - 1:02)
like seven years and i was like no that (1:00 - 1:04)
is the episode yeah a little it up on (1:02 - 1:06)
Wikipedia and prove you wrong that is (1:04 - 1:07)
the avoidance your happening right now (1:06 - 1:09)
hold on let's get this to go you're like (1:07 - 1:11)
we're gonna start the show and I'm like (1:09 - 1:14)
okay I know how that goes I know how (1:11 - 1:17)
starting the show goes I have no idea (1:14 - 1:19)
what is happening right now what's up (1:17 - 1:23)
everybody they see not me I have no idea (1:19 - 1:25)
how to do this anyway all right good (1:23 - 1:28)
good I'm glad we're all here I'm your (1:25 - 1:32)
host spj I have will anderson with us I (1:28 - 1:34)
do not eat the black and white cookie I (1:32 - 1:36)
eat no cookie too many carbs we'll get (1:34 - 1:38)
to that we also have Travis with us so i (1:36 - 1:40)
had i'm wearing these new headphones (1:38 - 1:44)
because my last ones fizzled out at me (1:40 - 1:45)
while i was at work and I just went to (1:44 - 1:48)
the the nearest corner store to buy some (1:45 - 1:50)
more because I wanted to listen to (1:48 - 1:52)
things i do and i ended up buying the (1:50 - 1:54)
only kind they had which were the i (1:52 - 1:56)
prefer the ones that just sit (1:54 - 1:58)
comfortably in your ears and they're (1:56 - 1:59)
just like your little your friends I (1:58 - 2:01)
don't like the ones that are invasive (1:59 - 2:03)
about it that like you're supposed to (2:01 - 2:07)
stick into your ear because now I'm very (2:03 - 2:11)
a we aware of the ear canal situation (2:07 - 2:14)
and like what my ear what the structure (2:11 - 2:17)
of that is and it's weird to me that (2:14 - 2:19)
each one feels different and I don't (2:17 - 2:21)
know how worried about that I should be (2:19 - 2:24)
I'm very confused right now good no (2:21 - 2:25)
understand her I think he was just (2:24 - 2:27)
making an allegory to the brexit I have (2:25 - 2:32)
no clue lies I understand the jam (2:27 - 2:34)
astic situation that you are in with the (2:32 - 2:38)
ear pods there because there's the ones (2:34 - 2:41)
that the traditional like apple style (2:38 - 2:43)
that are there just a circle that's the (2:41 - 2:48)
speaker it forms most of the surface of (2:43 - 2:50)
the headphone sits in there and it (2:48 - 2:53)
floats and it plays your tunes and then (2:50 - 2:54)
there's the ones I'm wearing right now (2:53 - 2:57)
which are lift craft Ian in that they (2:54 - 3:00)
are a range tentacle that's invading my (2:57 - 3:02)
ear canal they have they come with (3:00 - 3:06)
different sized cushions bubbles these (3:02 - 3:09)
can swap out depending on your ear size (3:06 - 3:14)
i guess and either they are too far out (3:09 - 3:17)
and they fall at the slightest gust of (3:14 - 3:20)
wind or they're too far in and I I just (3:17 - 3:24)
become intimately familiar with but your (3:20 - 3:27)
canal so your problem is that you don't (3:24 - 3:30)
have over the ear or on your headphones (3:27 - 3:34)
which are superior to the ear pod flash (3:30 - 3:38)
tentacle posh situation yeah and Steve (3:34 - 3:40)
just to clear things up the GM situation (3:38 - 3:42)
is between your toes it's the wax (3:40 - 3:45)
situation in your ears stop all right (3:42 - 3:48)
okay we also have Kippy here which I (3:45 - 3:50)
think we introduced last time as Tyler (3:48 - 3:53)
but known as Kippy the boss in slack so (3:50 - 3:57)
that's what i normally reference by how (3:53 - 4:00)
are you doing ma'am i'm rather confused (3:57 - 4:02)
but I think that's just my ability (4:00 - 4:04)
alright are you are your ears okay are (4:02 - 4:07)
they well when we get to our break i'll (4:04 - 4:11)
be switching me a headphones because the (4:07 - 4:13)
one side of them just fizzled out but i (4:11 - 4:16)
can continue on for now i'm glad that (4:13 - 4:18)
you and Travis have a relatable issue (4:16 - 4:21)
let's get back to throwing up why so if (4:18 - 4:24)
you're listening to this right now have (4:21 - 4:26)
you ever just SAT there after lunch and (4:24 - 4:33)
gone I think this is coming back up no (4:26 - 4:37)
cuz that yes good good cuz that's what (4:33 - 4:40)
that's what I that's what I feel right (4:37 - 4:42)
now we can detour real quick because (4:40 - 4:44)
we're we're nowhere near the topic of (4:42 - 4:45)
Pokemon but (4:44 - 4:48)
you are right well as in the episode of (4:45 - 4:50)
the black and white cookie from Seinfeld (4:48 - 4:52)
that that is the episode where Jerry (4:50 - 4:54)
talks about not throwing up for seven (4:52 - 4:56)
years and then he buys the black and (4:54 - 4:59)
white cookie and explains to Elaine that (4:56 - 5:02)
if everyone just looked to the cookie (4:59 - 5:04)
that would solve all the racial problems (5:02 - 5:07)
in the world and then he eats the cookie (5:04 - 5:10)
and then throws up later which is a (5:07 - 5:13)
metaphor of saying that the racial (5:10 - 5:15)
problems can't even be solved by the (5:13 - 5:17)
cookie because he grew up the cookie (5:15 - 5:20)
that is deeper than I had taken it I (5:17 - 5:22)
thought he threw up because he neglected (5:20 - 5:25)
you know people of Latin descent who (5:22 - 5:29)
aren't so firmly black or white hmm well (5:25 - 5:32)
the cookie is is clearly stating that (5:29 - 5:33)
black and white people can get together (5:32 - 5:35)
and then he eats the cookie but then he (5:33 - 5:38)
throws up mean yes it's it getting back (5:35 - 5:40)
to throwing up i took some stomach (5:38 - 5:43)
medicine but I got home and I feel like (5:40 - 5:46)
everyone remembers the like the last (5:43 - 5:48)
time they threw up like that at least to (5:46 - 5:51)
me that is a very vivid memory and mine (5:48 - 5:53)
was about two years ago very early in (5:51 - 5:55)
the morning Irene was leaving for the (5:53 - 5:58)
weekend and as she was getting ready I (5:55 - 6:00)
was just sitting near the toilet which (5:58 - 6:02)
became my like spot for the rest of the (6:00 - 6:05)
day Wow I remember this vividly and so (6:02 - 6:09)
now I am cautiously aware of making sure (6:05 - 6:12)
that going into this weekend that i am (6:09 - 6:14)
sitting on my couch and not my toilet hi (6:12 - 6:17)
this is travis speaking this is the (6:14 - 6:20)
Travis's voice you're listening to just (6:17 - 6:21)
here to remind you that this is a (6:20 - 6:25)
pokemon podcast just want to check in (6:21 - 6:29)
here and say I too am very confused as (6:25 - 6:30)
to why this is the topic of discussion (6:29 - 6:33)
usually off topic stuff at the beginning (6:30 - 6:36)
of the show is light banter about video (6:33 - 6:40)
games or something dubreq Cena meet ya (6:36 - 6:42)
let light things like video games or the (6:40 - 6:45)
brexit that joke is date will prob (6:42 - 6:46)
actually that's probably a pretty (6:45 - 6:47)
relevant historical thing that will be (6:46 - 6:50)
impactful for a long time however I'm (6:47 - 6:52)
just here to say we're in this together (6:50 - 6:55)
well we'll figure it out you and me (6:52 - 6:57)
listening this is not D&D Travis you (6:55 - 6:58)
can't just say that (6:57 - 7:02)
I can and I rolled the 20 so you know (6:58 - 7:05)
you you should have started that as not (7:02 - 7:10)
as my character right now but I cat (7:05 - 7:13)
sacred flame look which stomach medicine (7:10 - 7:15)
did you take as the only adult here (7:13 - 7:17)
which stomach medicine did you take I (7:15 - 7:18)
don't know what it's called it's knew it (7:17 - 7:20)
was new on the market it's like this (7:18 - 7:23)
it's this new thing called Tom's wait (7:20 - 7:25)
was it pink it was pink it was not Tom's (7:23 - 7:28)
it may might have been called nausea but (7:25 - 7:31)
it was a measurement is not called that (7:28 - 7:35)
I let me call like nauseate or something (7:31 - 7:37)
later yeah yeah yeah yeah it could be it (7:35 - 7:39)
could be it was a pink tablet you had to (7:37 - 7:42)
chew it they tasted like a sweetheart (7:39 - 7:46)
except more stale yeah yeah it's just (7:42 - 7:48)
got some variation on a bismuth how many (7:46 - 7:50)
did you take I took two I took what at (7:48 - 7:52)
first because I was I was wary of the (7:50 - 7:54)
taste and then after I had it I was like (7:52 - 7:55)
oh this isn't bad i'll have another one (7:54 - 7:57)
that's the kinda makes your tongue black (7:55 - 8:01)
right I don't think I hope not so ya (7:57 - 8:03)
know well bismuth makes something black (8:01 - 8:08)
but it's not your tongue oh yeah there's (8:03 - 8:10)
this thing you'll be feeling you'll be (8:08 - 8:12)
seeing that in a little while Steve if (8:10 - 8:14)
you're not having sort of a multi (8:12 - 8:18)
symptom gastrointestinal distress and it (8:14 - 8:21)
is really just like you feel that queasy (8:18 - 8:24)
I'm losing control I would I would say (8:21 - 8:28)
that my stomach doesn't hurt it's almost (8:24 - 8:29)
like a lingering in the back of the (8:28 - 8:31)
throat all right we don't have to get (8:29 - 8:33)
into too much detail but you've got kind (8:31 - 8:35)
of like that nervous feeling that (8:33 - 8:37)
something bad is eminent yeah we're all (8:35 - 8:39)
right now the nervous feeling is I don't (8:37 - 8:41)
want to throw up but I meant like a (8:39 - 8:43)
physical nervous feeling not a mental (8:41 - 8:45)
emotional one I'm just saying that there (8:43 - 8:49)
is a solution out there which I cannot (8:45 - 8:50)
recommend the name but it is lemon (8:49 - 8:53)
flavored and if you look in the stomach (8:50 - 8:55)
remedy section you'll you'll see it it (8:53 - 8:56)
comes in a green bottle and it kind of (8:55 - 8:58)
has a pastel rainbow on it go for that (8:56 - 9:01)
no because it's like within 15 minutes (8:58 - 9:04)
any kind of tickly stomach it goes away (9:01 - 9:07)
another option is to bite into some (9:04 - 9:09)
fresh ginger but that's not as easily (9:07 - 9:12)
obtainable that most people yeah doesn't (9:09 - 9:12)
sound (9:12 - 9:14)
appealing at all it's not meant to be (9:12 - 9:15)
appealing it's meant to make you feel (9:14 - 9:18)
better speaking of feeling better Travis (9:15 - 9:21)
how's your weekend with week uh fine (9:18 - 9:24)
good yeah great stomach doing fine yeah (9:21 - 9:26)
I'm okay i am getting on a flight (9:24 - 9:29)

hands but i'm ok i'm good i didn't do (9:30 - 9:34)
anything in particular you've told week (9:32 - 9:36)
you've told me behind the scenes we put (9:34 - 9:38)
put it out there that you get motion (9:36 - 9:41)
sickness car sickness boat sickness i (9:38 - 9:44)
can't remember if I am in a thing and (9:41 - 9:48)
it's moving and it's moving faster than (9:44 - 9:52)
human legs are designed to take a person (9:48 - 9:55)
you can you bet your bottom dollar that (9:52 - 9:58)
I will be queasy if I driving that's (9:55 - 10:00)
fine because I am in control of the (9:58 - 10:02)
situation but pretty much all the time (10:00 - 10:05)
if a thing is moving in I a minute I (10:02 - 10:06)
will feel nauseous that's something I (10:05 - 10:08)
don't know if I could live like that I (10:06 - 10:11)

Saturday did real real bad was upset (12:22 - 12:27)
about that then I ran so 10k is 6.2 (12:25 - 12:30)
miles somehow my phone seemed to (12:27 - 12:33)
indicate that Iran 6.8 miles I don't (12:30 - 12:34)
know how that happened but then on (12:33 - 12:37)
Sunday I ran over eight miles and I was (12:34 - 12:38)
real happy because my speeds were (12:37 - 12:40)
actually better than i did in the 10k (12:38 - 12:43)
and then i went to work on monday and (12:40 - 12:45)
that was the usual and here we are (12:43 - 12:47)
that's that's it now it's Friday night (12:45 - 12:49)
right I'm night yeah this is a second (12:47 - 12:51)
time recording Friday night s Travis (12:49 - 12:54)
said earlier he is going out of town up (12:51 - 12:58)
to the frozen north of canada to visit (12:54 - 13:01)
the aforementioned girlfriend do you (12:58 - 13:03)
have wait wait do you have a passport (13:01 - 13:06)
yeah clearly you where mine is because (13:03 - 13:08)
I'd lost mine a long time ago and I just (13:06 - 13:10)
have no idea so you're a thought process (13:08 - 13:13)
here is if I know it's could be friends (13:10 - 13:15)
and maybe mine is hanging out with yours (13:13 - 13:19)
you've been to my house so my passport (13:15 - 13:22)
well I know you could I talk real you're (13:19 - 13:24)
picked up my passport and walked out (13:22 - 13:26)
don't jumped out of glove window which (13:24 - 13:27)
was happening (13:26 - 13:30)
that your own let me have a think that (13:27 - 13:31)
that was that a thing that was relevant (13:30 - 13:34)
during any Pokemon podcast episodes or (13:31 - 13:37)
is that only relevant during dungeons (13:34 - 13:38)
and dragon i'ts I think there was an (13:37 - 13:40)
episode with just will and myself we (13:38 - 13:42)
talk about love window I want to ask the (13:40 - 13:44)
important question here is it's it's (13:42 - 13:47)
late June i'm assuming canada still (13:44 - 13:50)
covered in snow correct good that is (13:47 - 13:51)
incorrect although i do have the weather (13:50 - 13:54)
forecast up if you want to for uh for (13:51 - 13:56)
Winnipeg if you want me that yeah let's (13:54 - 13:58)
let's let our listeners in Winnipeg know (13:56 - 14:01)
the weather two days after it already (13:58 - 14:03)
happened they are one listener gonna peg (14:01 - 14:07)
is skipping this episode haha now i (14:03 - 14:10)
would i look at look at the stats we (14:07 - 14:13)
have listeners in canada so Carly kindly (14:10 - 14:15)
changed it to Fahrenheit so I would know (14:13 - 14:17)
where any of these numbers mean so it (14:15 - 14:19)
actually won't really mean anything to (14:17 - 14:22)
Canadian listeners would say that when I (14:19 - 14:25)
say that Saturday will have looks like (14:22 - 14:27)
there's a symbol with a cloud with (14:25 - 14:29)
lightning come off coming off it so it's (14:27 - 14:31)
not a great sign with a high of 75 low (14:29 - 14:35)
of 59 on Sunday living to a is there (14:31 - 14:38)
rain there no I think at that no you get (14:35 - 14:42)
a chance of rain showers a high of 64 (14:38 - 14:45)
low of 50 then we get into the early bit (14:42 - 14:46)
of the work week we're getting a little (14:45 - 14:49)
better temperatures there 7277 and (14:46 - 14:51)
eighty one of the highest for monday (14:49 - 14:53)
tuesday and wednesday when you're riding (14:51 - 14:58)
up on Canada Day which i think is fried (14:53 - 15:00)
day you're gonna be nice clear skies (14:58 - 15:03)
high of 82 low of 59 great for those (15:00 - 15:06)
fireworks might want to take a (15:03 - 15:07)
sweatshirt with you when it gets a (15:06 - 15:09)
little chillier at the end of the night (15:07 - 15:12)

opinions on the what's going to happen (17:06 - 17:11)
after the brexit (17:09 - 17:12)
really want to come to a bunch of (17:11 - 17:16)
Americans on a pokemon fire I'm willing (17:12 - 17:18)

retirement account that is now empty hey (17:20 - 17:27)
I got a somewhat of a retirement account (17:25 - 17:31)
yeah speak for yourself because Travis (17:27 - 17:33)
use you on that old hardware you on the (17:31 - 17:35)
new one I never buy the upgrades when (17:33 - 17:37)
they come out I had just by the launch (17:35 - 17:39)
version I was still on the only reason I (17:37 - 17:41)
had a DS lite was because i was using my (17:39 - 17:45)
dads i'm technically my d s was always (17:41 - 17:48)
the d/s fat the silver launch one and (17:45 - 17:50)
ever buy any of the upgrade so I'm just (17:48 - 17:52)
on the normal 3d s nothing would Cano (17:50 - 17:55)
Pokemon 3ds would know vanilla seconds (17:52 - 17:59)
videos pokemon then convince I want okay (17:55 - 18:01)
if you if what would convince me to buy (17:59 - 18:04)
if they bundled it with the next (18:01 - 18:06)
generation of handheld console and it (18:04 - 18:08)
was and it was the same price and like a (18:06 - 18:10)
year earlier yeah I'd probably pick that (18:08 - 18:12)
way but but barring that I doubt I would (18:10 - 18:16)
ever buy any special edition 3ds unless (18:12 - 18:19)
it said unless had a picture of my face (18:16 - 18:22)
on it and said hey Trev this one's for (18:19 - 18:25)
you I'd buy that like I would consider (18:22 - 18:27)
that I would there would still be at the (18:25 - 18:30)
back of my mind maybe this is a waste of (18:27 - 18:33)
money Kippy are you on old hardware new (18:30 - 18:35)
hardware I'm on a two dias oh here on a (18:33 - 18:38)
2d s i like i like the shoulder buttons (18:35 - 18:41)
on that yes it's very comfortable and a (18:38 - 18:42)
lot more durable than the three dias and (18:41 - 18:44)
also a lot more cheap i got mine for (18:42 - 18:47)
eighty nine dollars less can't go wrong (18:44 - 18:50)

Machamp in a sheriff ball parish ball (19:58 - 20:05)
shiny machamp is amazing is it green I (20:01 - 20:08)
think it's green I think it's the ugly (20:05 - 20:12)
green color ah the eye I'm pokémons (20:08 - 20:15)
website though it does say that for the (20:12 - 20:16)
u.s. national championship it's only (20:15 - 20:19)
listing Omega Ruby alpha sapphire so I (20:16 - 20:21)
don't know if that's thing that the x y (20:19 - 20:23)
or x and y copy won't work because the (20:21 - 20:26)
bubble pd article said that it will so (20:23 - 20:29)
if you're in the US I would only bank on (20:26 - 20:31)
Omega Ruby alpha sapphire I don't get (20:29 - 20:33)
what the limitations are besides just (20:31 - 20:34)
saying hey make sure you have the newest (20:33 - 20:36)
game not like there's hardware (20:34 - 20:40)
limitations to distributing a 20 year (20:36 - 20:42)
old pokemon i just looked up the shiny (20:40 - 20:45)
Machamp and it is actually a very good (20:42 - 20:47)
emerald green instead of like the ugly (20:45 - 20:50)
green i ugly just like a new green I'm (20:47 - 20:53)
all right I would say that that's an (20:50 - 20:57)
ugly green I'm feel like it to describe (20:53 - 20:59)
it as emerald it would have to be a (20:57 - 21:02)
little deeper of a green darker I'm (20:59 - 21:05)
pulling it off of google images a might (21:02 - 21:07)

ignorance about anything that happens on (26:08 - 26:14)
the other side of the Atlantic Ocean or (26:12 - 26:18)
honestly a Pacific Ocean to look you (26:14 - 26:20)

Jay writes and says here's a question (32:46 - 32:52)
for the show maybe more of a topic but (32:50 - 32:54)
you all should talk about shiny pokemon (32:52 - 32:57)
you'd really like to get I'd like a (32:54 - 33:00)
legit shiny manaphy because it's hard to (32:57 - 33:03)
get thank you guys keep it up yeah now I (33:00 - 33:05)
gotta see and remember what should my (33:03 - 33:06)
favorite Pokemon actually have good (33:05 - 33:08)
Chinese well I'm actually currently in (33:06 - 33:11)
the process of breeding a shiny so (33:08 - 33:12)
that's the one I would really like to (33:11 - 33:14)
get because I would like to stop having (33:12 - 33:17)
to open eggs for that particular shiny (33:14 - 33:21)
but that's gonna be a giveaway so the (33:17 - 33:24)
shiny pokemon i would like for myself I (33:21 - 33:27)
was gonna say Rotom but it's not as (33:24 - 33:30)
Chinese not that special yeah I'm not (33:27 - 33:33)
I'm not too big on Chinese just because (33:30 - 33:36)
there I feel like they're not special at (33:33 - 33:38)
all you can just are in g1 you can just (33:36 - 33:41)
but you don't do that you can't imagine (33:38 - 33:44)
you can and that destroys the rarity of (33:41 - 33:47)
them I'm gonna go a slurpuff shiny (33:44 - 33:50)
orange eeing is for other people when (33:47 - 33:52)
you actually go through the process and (33:50 - 33:54)
get it yourself that is your own sense (33:52 - 33:56)
of accomplishment it's so wonderful it (33:54 - 34:00)
really is I mean I am I I think what I (33:56 - 34:02)
would be excited for us to finally find (34:00 - 34:05)
my first shiny in the wild and I feel (34:02 - 34:07)
like I was very I was very very big on (34:05 - 34:09)
shinies until I went to like he win him (34:07 - 34:12)
before i went to a u.s. national pokémon (34:09 - 34:14)
turner worlds where every single (34:12 - 34:16)
competitor is disillusioned back in 2011 (34:14 - 34:19)
where every single competitor is using a (34:16 - 34:22)
full shiny team and to me that took a (34:19 - 34:25)
lot of this the specialness away but I (34:22 - 34:27)
think weird all of the shinies have 31 (34:25 - 34:30)
IVs down the line yeah that is so (34:27 - 34:33)
must have put in a lot of time but yeah (34:30 - 34:35)
I I'm just looking forward to my first (34:33 - 34:39)
shiny that I come naturally in the wild (34:35 - 34:42)
um did you not tip anybody in x and y (34:39 - 34:45)
yes i did because the rumor was if you (34:42 - 34:49)
did like tip highly that there'd be more (34:45 - 34:50)
of an opportunity for you to encounter a (34:49 - 34:53)
shiny and i encountered all kinds of (34:50 - 34:55)
wild chinese and x and y at (34:53 - 34:57)
my my playthrough through x and y cuz i (34:55 - 34:59)
was doing some pokemon bank stuff (34:57 - 35:04)
earlier last week and i put about 85 (34:59 - 35:07)
hours next and why so that's it that's (35:04 - 35:09)
it i'm not i'm not sitting there doing (35:07 - 35:11)
things I don't enjoy I don't enjoy (35:09 - 35:13)
driving a bike in a circle hatching eggs (35:11 - 35:16)
no you're thank you I don't enjoy (35:13 - 35:19)
farming some berries nope no thank you (35:16 - 35:22)
double Braun yeah you're wrong on all (35:19 - 35:24)
counts I think shiny volcarona looks (35:22 - 35:27)
beautiful shiny slurpuff is is my answer (35:24 - 35:29)
the question cuz it looks really red and (35:27 - 35:31)
any tasty volcarona i don't like my (35:29 - 35:33)
absolute all-time favorite pokemon (35:31 - 35:37)
volcarona is yeah like when i get my (35:33 - 35:40)
tattoo sleeve of pokemon it's probably (35:37 - 35:43)
gonna be all fire types just because it (35:40 - 35:45)
seems like all of my favorites 10 intend (35:43 - 35:47)
to be in the fire type range would you (35:45 - 35:54)
invest de Mille our Vesta Oh breaking (35:47 - 35:56)
out the bad puns already good you're (35:54 - 35:58)
pretty far into the show I would say (35:56 - 36:00)
something thank you all good diving I (35:58 - 36:02)
just say something intelligent about lar (36:00 - 36:04)
Vesta and volcarona and interesting (36:02 - 36:06)
things about their evolutionary patterns (36:04 - 36:09)
but I don't want it to be wasted on this (36:06 - 36:11)
program let's come back to volcarona (36:09 - 36:14)
some other day yikes yeah that's true (36:11 - 36:19)
this is this a bettin Kippy did you say (36:14 - 36:22)
what what shiny that you you would (36:19 - 36:23)
really like I want a shiny breloom (36:22 - 36:27)
breloom and gets this really nice solid (36:23 - 36:30)
red color when it's shiny um I would go (36:27 - 36:32)
for a shiny mud kit but I already have (36:30 - 36:35)
two of those so braylon is next on this (36:32 - 36:38)
alright alright cool cool next question (36:35 - 36:40)
here is from Zeki I think I'm saying (36:38 - 36:42)
that right that they're from Canada (36:40 - 36:45)
Travis okay they'll get use out of my (36:42 - 36:49)
forecast good good i'm so glad i just (36:45 - 36:52)
listened to the live twitch podcast this (36:49 - 36:54)
would email was a little less a month (36:52 - 36:55)
ago i also believe there will be (36:54 - 36:57)
character custom a customization but i (36:55 - 37:00)
want them I want there to be a limit (36:57 - 37:02)
part of black and white black to white (37:00 - 37:04)
to that made it worth by and was seeing (37:02 - 37:06)
red again in the world tournament too (37:04 - 37:08)
much customization and everyone's (37:06 - 37:09)
character will look different you won't (37:08 - 37:11)
have an imp you so you won't have (37:09 - 37:13)
impactful returns from prior (37:11 - 37:16)
protagonists I hope gen7 will be like x (37:13 - 37:19)
and y where everyone's Calum looked the (37:16 - 37:21)
same but for different skin colors what (37:19 - 37:23)
are your thoughts on the extent of (37:21 - 37:27)
customization Zeki well in x and y i (37:23 - 37:29)
could change the haircut the clothes the (37:27 - 37:32)
Hat everything besides the skin color (37:29 - 37:34)
there was a lot of customization x and y (37:32 - 37:37)
and i would i would hope you can (37:34 - 37:40)
change the face though correct correct (37:37 - 37:42)
well i mean it was a pretty plain face (37:40 - 37:47)
but i would say also to to look to the (37:42 - 37:51)
black-and-white generation of games not (37:47 - 37:54)
cookie to keep in mind right there was (37:51 - 37:57)
the ability to transfer your custom data (37:54 - 37:59)
from black and white up to black and (37:57 - 38:01)
white 2 so that as you play through the (37:59 - 38:03)
black and white 2 storyline there would (38:01 - 38:05)
be references to things that you had (38:03 - 38:06)
done in black and white there's no (38:05 - 38:08)
reason if they were going to do like a (38:06 - 38:09)
return of a protagonist thing that they (38:08 - 38:11)
couldn't do that kind of a thing again (38:09 - 38:14)
and say transfer your customized (38:11 - 38:16)
character into the new game and have (38:14 - 38:19)
that as you're a competitor or whatever (38:16 - 38:20)
whatever they want to do with it but I (38:19 - 38:24)
think the reason red works so well in (38:20 - 38:26)
the world tournament is because red is (38:24 - 38:30)
ash like that I know that like makes a (38:26 - 38:32)
lot of people cringe or like people (38:30 - 38:35)
don't want to hear that but red and blue (38:32 - 38:39)
or ash and Gary in some extent and like (38:35 - 38:43)
the the TV show wouldn't have done so (38:39 - 38:45)
well if those characters weren't (38:43 - 38:49)
slightly related and obviously they were (38:45 - 38:52)
related and that it did work and it did (38:49 - 38:54)
pay off because we got pokemon yellow (38:52 - 38:56)
after that we got exactly what that was (38:54 - 38:58)
afterwards we got Team Rocket in yellow (38:56 - 39:00)
we got pikachu following you like that (38:58 - 39:04)
was such a big impact and fans can go oh (39:00 - 39:06)
but it's red it's not ash and it's like (39:04 - 39:09)
yes but the success came because of how (39:06 - 39:12)
successful the TV show was that actually (39:09 - 39:16)
made that character so impactful and to (39:12 - 39:18)
bring that character back does that hold (39:16 - 39:20)
up 20 years later i don't think so i (39:18 - 39:22)
think we're (39:20 - 39:24)
point in games where people either want (39:22 - 39:27)
a really really good story or they want (39:24 - 39:31)
to be they want to be some sort of (39:27 - 39:34)
characterization of their thoughts and (39:31 - 39:36)
feelings whether some people want to (39:34 - 39:39)
play as female where normal email or (39:36 - 39:41)
some females want to play as male or in (39:39 - 39:43)
destiny I want to be an alien I don't (39:41 - 39:46)
want to be human like there is people (39:43 - 39:48)
want to be they want to use their (39:46 - 39:51)
imagination and so I think what worked (39:48 - 39:54)
in black and white was because black and (39:51 - 39:56)
white had a really strong story (39:54 - 39:59)
especially around the focus of n which (39:56 - 40:01)
is why I don't like black and white but (39:59 - 40:05)
I'm on the fence of wanting to wanting (40:01 - 40:07)
that journey to be me not wanting that (40:05 - 40:13)
journey to be red or blue or silver or (40:07 - 40:16)
gold which are you know in retrospect (40:13 - 40:19)
not very good names for characters but (40:16 - 40:21)
that's besides the point this anime you (40:19 - 40:25)
name your characters colors any dine (40:21 - 40:25)
Travis what are your thoughts I don't (40:26 - 40:30)
even know what I'm reacting to at this (40:28 - 40:32)
point yeah do you like your (40:30 - 40:35)
customization or not yeah love it give (40:32 - 40:39)
me more um yeah it's it's great thought (40:35 - 40:40)
they already announced character (40:39 - 40:42)
customization for sun and moon they did (40:40 - 40:44)
they did it's just i think the question (40:42 - 40:47)
asker is is asking if we would like not (40:44 - 40:50)
only to be able to change the outfit and (40:47 - 40:53)
skin tone of our character but to also (40:50 - 40:58)
be able to have some semblance of (40:53 - 41:02)
control over height or facial features (40:58 - 41:05)
that sort of thing and i would say that (41:02 - 41:07)
that is less important to me than is (41:05 - 41:10)
then are the character customization (41:07 - 41:14)
options that were in x and y but that (41:10 - 41:17)
would be cool i'm secretly hoping for an (41:14 - 41:21)
oblivion style you guess you're super (41:17 - 41:24)
sliders that can make a strange creature (41:21 - 41:27)
when you hit randomized and then you're (41:24 - 41:29)
just stuck with this beautiful creation (41:27 - 41:32)
from from then on out that would be cool (41:29 - 41:35)
but but that's the only part of me that (41:32 - 41:35)
would be excited (41:35 - 41:38)
by the possibility of like control of (41:35 - 41:39)
her facial features or something like (41:38 - 41:42)
that i would i would rather and i think (41:39 - 41:44)
the question also kind of focuses on (41:42 - 41:47)
like the more character customization (41:44 - 41:49)
you have in your main character the last (41:47 - 41:52)
impactful that character would be if it (41:49 - 41:54)
was to come back in a future game mmm (41:52 - 41:57)
and I get that again I'm still strongly (41:54 - 42:00)
wanting as much character customization (41:57 - 42:03)
as possible because I want that to be my (42:00 - 42:06)
journey a hundred percent but I would (42:03 - 42:09)
argue instead of worrying about the (42:06 - 42:11)
protectant the the male and female (42:09 - 42:14)
protagonists I would want to see more (42:11 - 42:18)
focus on the gym leaders themselves I (42:14 - 42:21)
and this goes back to the TV show in the (42:18 - 42:24)
anime I think we all remember the red (42:21 - 42:28)
and blue gym leaders very easily because (42:24 - 42:29)
not only were we playing the game and (42:28 - 42:31)
that was the only thing to play at the (42:29 - 42:33)
time that was pre-internet but because (42:31 - 42:36)
the anime lined up with that and made (42:33 - 42:40)
that a focus whereas as much as I loved (42:36 - 42:43)
x and y and I love diamond and pearl I (42:40 - 42:47)
don't remember seven of the eight gym (42:43 - 42:49)
leaders I think black and white in (42:47 - 42:51)
particular did a great job with the gym (42:49 - 42:52)
leaders and involving them in the story (42:51 - 42:54)
I can't I can't even remember her name (42:52 - 42:56)
cuz I'm gonna say it wrong Laura Laura (42:54 - 43:00)
Laura she was the rally she was the (42:56 - 43:02)
normal type gym leader second gym leader (43:00 - 43:04)
why I remember who you're talking about (43:02 - 43:06)
but i also don't remember I don't (43:04 - 43:09)
remember like first gen gym leaders name (43:06 - 43:11)
so oh man i think i can get them all (43:09 - 43:14)
it's it's brock misty lieutenant surge (43:11 - 43:19)
Erica Sabrina Koga Giovanni that's it (43:14 - 43:23)
right no you forgot the eight Lane yes (43:19 - 43:26)
yeah they all I don't know and the only (43:23 - 43:28)
things I remember from generation to is (43:26 - 43:30)
like Faulkner Gimli just have never (43:28 - 43:32)
really meant a lot to me I don't I don't (43:30 - 43:36)
I find it I find it straight like I find (43:32 - 43:38)
it strange that I mean I understand what (43:36 - 43:39)
people care about them because they're (43:38 - 43:41)
characters in a game they like but it (43:39 - 43:44)
but they with the exception of like I (43:41 - 43:46)
was saying in black and white I feel (43:44 - 43:48)
like they are such a small part of the (43:46 - 43:49)
experience of the game like (43:48 - 43:51)
they're essentially boss fights and I (43:49 - 43:54)
don't remember the like I don't like (43:51 - 43:56)
kingdom hearts 2 is one of my favorite (43:54 - 43:58)
games but if you ask me what the boss (43:56 - 44:03)
was on The Nightmare Before Christmas (43:58 - 44:05)
level like what the second boss was I (44:03 - 44:08)
would have no idea and it's the same for (44:05 - 44:09)
me and Pokemon it's that I don't (44:08 - 44:11)
remember the characters of the gym (44:09 - 44:14)
leaders it wasn't Leonora the normal gym (44:11 - 44:17)
leader in nat green city yeah you had (44:14 - 44:21)
with so much time to look that up (44:17 - 44:21)
alright well we'll do one more session (44:21 - 44:26)
where they're like oh I here's a pop (44:23 - 44:28)

night one from 1975 and one from 2016 (44:34 - 44:41)
good luck everyone else I remember iris (44:37 - 44:44)

TV show for making iris follow ash (44:44 - 44:50)
around yeah Clemence yep orc Lamont (44:47 - 44:53)

back and and as the viewer you're like (45:30 - 45:39)
oh yeah when did that happen I think of (45:33 - 45:41)
now and I'm on like this huge like (45:39 - 45:44)
Pokemon anime high of like reffered (45:41 - 45:48)
going back to the anime as a crutch here (45:44 - 45:51)
but when i when i watch wrestling will (45:48 - 45:52)
can relate to this a little bit i think (45:51 - 45:55)
even though we had 30 toros by the way (45:52 - 45:58)
oh he at 30 okay good good to know so (45:55 - 46:00)
when you watch wrestling you see all (45:58 - 46:01)
these different characters and they're (46:00 - 46:03)
all trying to be a (46:01 - 46:05)
Richter and sometimes their character (46:03 - 46:08)
doesn't work and there's there's one or (46:05 - 46:09)
two things that can happen in wrestling (46:08 - 46:12)
where it could wear something happens (46:09 - 46:15)
where you suddenly love the character (46:12 - 46:17)
there's something that they do so maybe (46:15 - 46:19)
something little something big there's a (46:17 - 46:21)
way to make a character extremely (46:19 - 46:24)
popular and so now I'm thinking back to (46:21 - 46:26)
then this probably happened in other (46:24 - 46:28)
things besides wrestling anyways but (46:26 - 46:31)
going back to the anime you look at a (46:28 - 46:34)
pokemon like Tauros and you go it's just (46:31 - 46:36)
it's just a buffalo like it's not (46:34 - 46:39)
interesting it's normal things retail it (46:36 - 46:41)
has two retails yeah but it's kind of (46:39 - 46:43)
plain it's a little vanilla and you go (46:41 - 46:46)
how can we make Toros popular how can we (46:43 - 46:49)
get the masses behind Tauros and a stunt (46:46 - 46:53)
like ash catching 30 of them and then (46:49 - 46:56)
them showing up randomly is like a great (46:53 - 46:59)
way of going you know what Taurus is (46:56 - 47:02)
actually kind of cool didn't work on me (46:59 - 47:05)
I worked on me I'm a sucker for that I (47:02 - 47:06)
think I think that like that was the (47:05 - 47:09)
moment where I'm like yeah tauros is all (47:06 - 47:11)
right also they did that with muck like (47:09 - 47:13)
muck was also a pokemon that the anime (47:11 - 47:17)
really kind of put some steam behind the (47:13 - 47:20)
muck and Professor Oak shipping (47:17 - 47:23)
relationship very very a okay in my book (47:20 - 47:25)
you want to talk about it cool shiny (47:23 - 47:28)
let's talk about tauros shiny isn't it (47:25 - 47:31)
green it is that its body is bright (47:28 - 47:34)
yellow like a lemon yellow and then it's (47:31 - 47:39)
the brown fur is like a lime green so (47:34 - 47:42)
you gotta yet like a sprite situation on (47:39 - 47:44)
your hands or sierra mist depending on (47:42 - 47:47)
your brand loyalty or seven maybe even (47:44 - 47:50)
seven up maybe you consider Mountain Dew (47:47 - 47:54)
a beverage instead of an acid good all (47:50 - 47:56)
right we'll move on to our item of the (47:54 - 48:01)
week now renamed a Jolteon watch (47:56 - 48:01)
well there are no wait don't you don now (48:02 - 48:10)
you have it I figured that we would go (48:06 - 48:14)
over the jolteon cooter re cutie pokey (48:10 - 48:19)
plush 999 hatari cutie that how you (48:14 - 48:21)
pronounce it qatari I believe so alright (48:19 - 48:24)
so this is the jolteon cutie pokey plush (48:21 - 48:28)
a recently Pokemon Center redid their (48:24 - 48:30)
website if you go to pokemon center com (48:28 - 48:33)
it does state that they redid their (48:30 - 48:34)
website it's like we'd redid things (48:33 - 48:37)
enjoy it looks almost exactly the same i (48:34 - 48:38)
think the cart icon in the upper right (48:37 - 48:40)
hand corner is slightly different the (48:38 - 48:42)
other thing I noticed is that there is a (48:40 - 48:46)
verified buyer button so the reviews (48:42 - 48:48)
that come in we can make sure that the (48:46 - 48:51)
person leaving the review is a verified (48:48 - 48:54)
buyer this might be some foreshadowing (48:51 - 48:56)
to see if one of our favorite reviewers (48:54 - 48:58)

to em verified by our 5 out of 5 stars (52:02 - 52:08)
we switched from a Pokeball review (52:05 - 52:11)
system to a star review system about (52:08 - 52:13)
this jolteon about two weeks before (52:11 - 52:16)
Christmas as a birthday present to a (52:13 - 52:19)
good friend of mine I wonder what they (52:16 - 52:20)
got him for Christmas (52:19 - 52:22)
bite the busy shopping week it was (52:20 - 52:24)
delivered in about three to four days it (52:22 - 52:27)
was a pleasant surprise opening the (52:24 - 52:30)
package this little one was just the (52:27 - 52:32)
cutest thing it's smaller than I thought (52:30 - 52:35)
it would be and has no issue standing on (52:32 - 52:41)
a desk or a shelf my friend loved it now (52:35 - 52:44)
I want one for myself alright Travie saw (52:41 - 52:46)
you as a good review this next review is (52:44 - 52:49)
coming to you from sr hunt plush (52:46 - 52:51)
collector this is another five-star (52:49 - 52:55)
review from a verified buyer titled cute (52:51 - 52:57)
little buddy my love for jolteon is (52:55 - 53:00)
fairly new so I decided to order this (52:57 - 53:03)
qatari plush and he is adorable he's (53:00 - 53:07)
really soft and sits nightly nicely sits (53:03 - 53:10)
nightly on the top of the small TV in my (53:07 - 53:13)
bedroom however he's so cute that I keep (53:10 - 53:15)
taking him off my TV to cuddle him if (53:13 - 53:17)
you want a cheaper alternative to the (53:15 - 53:19)
more game accurate plushies but still (53:17 - 53:22)
want a nice quality plush this is (53:19 - 53:26)
perfect well this one is actually oh I (53:22 - 53:29)
thought I thought the line next to next (53:26 - 53:30)
to share meant that it had been shared (53:29 - 53:34)
but that's just to share the review yeah (53:30 - 53:36)
I think I meant one that was someone (53:34 - 53:38)
there was a one person that shared it (53:36 - 53:41)
why would you share the review like this (53:38 - 53:43)
this this is the review that convinces (53:41 - 53:46)
you to buy it right that's why you would (53:43 - 53:49)
share it could you ever imagine yourself (53:46 - 53:52)
sharing a review of a product no no not (53:49 - 53:55)
all but i'm sure some people have Oh (53:52 - 53:59)
find one well I didn't share any of (53:55 - 54:01)
these on Twitter cuz they're over 140 (53:59 - 54:03)
characters and it doesn't abbreviate (54:01 - 54:07)
them for you I uh I do have two of these (54:03 - 54:10)
QD already QD pushes I actually have a (54:07 - 54:14)
Pikachu one and i have a slowpoke one up (54:10 - 54:16)
at you or awakeish ooh ah they're both (54:14 - 54:19)
awake i like my pokemon staring me in (54:16 - 54:22)
the eyes when they're resting on top of (54:19 - 54:25)
my displays which is where they're both (54:22 - 54:27)
at one at work on top of my cinema (54:25 - 54:31)
display one here at home resting over my (54:27 - 54:33)
imac yeah they're nice quality they're (54:31 - 54:34)
10 (54:33 - 54:37)
is worthy i would say uh but yeah that (54:34 - 54:40)
that's been your weekly jolteon watch (54:37 - 54:42)
we'll we'll wrap up this episode here we (54:40 - 54:47)
got pokemon of the week this week's (54:42 - 54:51)
pokémon to celebrate all mongooses all (54:47 - 54:55)
the time Zangoose the original mongoose (54:51 - 54:57)
Pokemon except it's not classified it as (54:55 - 54:59)
that it's classified as the cat favorite (54:57 - 55:03)
Pokemon is it really yeah that's a darn (54:59 - 55:05)
shame the cat ferret pokémon pokedex (55:03 - 55:11)
number 3 35 it is not known to evolve it (55:05 - 55:14)
is well known for an ongoing feud with (55:11 - 55:18)
seviper which in retrospect is a real (55:14 - 55:20)
good name for pokemon that is a snake (55:18 - 55:23)
ongoing feud is also a good like (55:20 - 55:26)
post-hardcore band name I'll just read a (55:23 - 55:28)
little bit here before Travis gets to a (55:26 - 55:30)
move set zangoose is bitter enemies with (55:28 - 55:33)
Seviper which it has battled against for (55:30 - 55:36)
many generations it's claws are its best (55:33 - 55:39)
weapon weapons and it can be used for (55:36 - 55:43)
its former signature move crush claw it (55:39 - 55:47)
lives in grassy areas it's a sad day in (55:43 - 55:51)
Pokemon Britain Pokemon facts that (55:47 - 55:54)
signature moves are taken away from (55:51 - 55:57)
pokemon i think crustal knows crush claw (55:54 - 56:01)
now does anybody think that zangoose (55:57 - 56:04)
very has a striking resemblance to 70s (56:01 - 56:08)
era David Bowie now that you mention it (56:04 - 56:09)
that makes sense I don't know if it's on (56:08 - 56:11)
purpose but you there's there's (56:09 - 56:13)
certainly some star dusting happening of (56:11 - 56:16)
the variety and his name starts with Z (56:13 - 56:20)
like Ziggy mom's a question though where (56:16 - 56:23)
were the spiders actually I can't finish (56:20 - 56:26)
this line because he says a line that i (56:23 - 56:28)
wouldn't say i wanna show with kids on (56:26 - 56:29)
it what other the line can i say from (56:28 - 56:32)
Ziggy Stardust he played a left hand but (56:29 - 56:35)
made it too far then we were Ziggy's (56:32 - 56:38)
band the spiders were from Mars that's (56:35 - 56:41)
true you lost me but that's very great (56:38 - 56:44)
song so ye Stardust base stats of (56:41 - 56:48)
zangoose 73 HP 115 attack (56:44 - 56:50)
60 60 60 defense special tech special (56:48 - 56:54)
defense 90 speed if you do that math (56:50 - 56:56)
real quick that is 458 and based at (56:54 - 56:59)
totals it knows the abilities immunity (56:56 - 57:02)
and toxic boost I'm sure Travis will (56:59 - 57:04)
tell you which one is better along with (57:02 - 57:07)
a move set zangoose is actually the only (57:04 - 57:10)
pokemon that has the ability toxic boost (57:07 - 57:13)
toxic boost is like guts except that it (57:10 - 57:17)
only happens with toxic are well with (57:13 - 57:20)
poison rather the way it works is your (57:17 - 57:24)
attack is increased by 50% when you when (57:20 - 57:26)
zangoose is poisoned because of that (57:24 - 57:28)
you're you're going to choose that (57:26 - 57:31)
ability / immunity immunities and ice (57:28 - 57:33)
ability makes you immune to poison the (57:31 - 57:34)
only time you would if you had the (57:33 - 57:36)
option of both of these abilities which (57:34 - 57:38)
you only do in zangoose but (57:36 - 57:39)
theoretically if there are another (57:38 - 57:41)
Pokemon that both of these ability Joyce (57:39 - 57:43)
is the only way in which immunity really (57:41 - 57:45)
gets an edge as if you're making a (57:43 - 57:48)
defensive Pokemon because you wouldn't (57:45 - 57:50)
be using that boosted attack stat so you (57:48 - 57:53)
would want to not you wouldn't waste (57:50 - 57:54)
your item slot on something that's just (57:53 - 57:57)
gonna reduce your health over time and (57:54 - 57:59)
you would be immune to poison however (57:57 - 58:03)
zangoose has terrible defensive stats so (57:59 - 58:04)
instead we're going to take advantage of (58:03 - 58:08)
its offensive stats a mostly its attacks (58:04 - 58:11)
because its speed is only 90 we are (58:08 - 58:13)
going to give it a toxic orb so that we (58:11 - 58:16)
can ensure that we are poisoned we're (58:13 - 58:18)
going to go with an adamant nature v's (58:16 - 58:21)
252 in attack and speed and you can (58:18 - 58:24)
throw the extra four on defense now in (58:21 - 58:26)
terms of moves that are a no-brainer we (58:24 - 58:28)
have facade the reason you're going to (58:26 - 58:30)
be doing that is because facade itself (58:28 - 58:35)
doubles in its base power when the (58:30 - 58:37)
Pokemon using it is afflicted by a (58:35 - 58:41)
status condition a major one I don't (58:37 - 58:43)
believe confusion or attraction count in (58:41 - 58:45)
fact I'm sure that they don't because (58:43 - 58:47)
when you consider that that becomes a (58:45 - 58:50)
140 based power move and your attack is (58:47 - 58:52)
being increased by fifty percent under (58:50 - 58:56)
toxic it becomes a and you're getting (58:52 - 58:58)
the same type of TAC bonus because (58:56 - 59:00)
zangoose is a normal type and facade is (58:58 - 59:01)
a normal type move (59:00 - 59:06)
you get up to a pretty wild base power (59:01 - 59:08)
if what i'm reading is is true and not a (59:06 - 59:12)
lie apparently that adds up to 350 15 (59:08 - 59:15)
base power which is unbelievable next I (59:12 - 59:20)
like close combat for some type coverage (59:15 - 59:23)
because it gives you super effective (59:20 - 59:26)
strikes on a lot of types that resists (59:23 - 59:29)
normal namely rock and steel the third (59:26 - 59:35)
and fourth slots are up to you I would (59:29 - 59:39)
include mac off on the list because it (59:35 - 59:45)
is super effective against ghost types (59:39 - 59:47)
which you would not be able to hit with (59:45 - 59:50)
either facade or not or so facade or (59:47 - 59:52)
close combat but the unfortunate thing (59:50 - 59:55)
there is that you only knock off is only (59:52 - 59:58)
powerful when you're actively knocking (59:55 - 60:00)
off an item so you could alternatively (59:58 - 60:03)
go with shadow claw there if you always (60:00 - 60:05)
want to be super effective and deal (60:03 - 60:07)
decent damage to ghost types as opposed (60:05 - 60:09)
to having one very strong attack that (60:07 - 60:13)
you hope kills it for the fourth move we (60:09 - 60:16)
could either go with protect to ensure (60:13 - 60:20)
that you get your toxic or off and (60:16 - 60:23)
you're poisoned before you even make an (60:20 - 60:26)
attack so that you're not losing a lot (60:23 - 60:29)
of HP when you're not dishing out a lot (60:26 - 60:33)
of damage or you could go with quick (60:29 - 60:35)
attack because zangoose is pretty slow (60:33 - 60:37)
we saw that 90 base speed which isn't (60:35 - 60:40)
going to do a lot for that reason you (60:37 - 60:43)
could consider a jolly nature as opposed (60:40 - 60:47)
to adamant but given that it's still not (60:43 - 60:48)
going out speed a lot so I would still (60:47 - 60:50)
recommend adamant especially because it (60:48 - 60:53)
really does a good job at breaking walls (60:50 - 60:55)
or defensive pokemon that's sort of (60:53 - 60:57)
where it shines so you're not really (60:55 - 60:59)
worried about that Matt's out speeding (60:57 - 61:01)
you but I lost my train of thought so I (60:59 - 61:03)
would say that the main set you're going (61:01 - 61:06)
to want to use is facade knock off close (61:03 - 61:10)
combat and protect but shadow claw and (61:06 - 61:13)
quick attack are viable options as well (61:10 - 61:15)
I think I'm done (61:13 - 61:18)
Oh zangoose is based off the Mongoose a (61:15 - 61:21)
cat-like carnivore that is well known (61:18 - 61:22)
