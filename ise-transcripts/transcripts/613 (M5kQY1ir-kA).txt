Oh no just one complaint more like but I (0:31 - 0:37)

a year but finally we have Hannah to com (0:37 - 0:44)
to be the complainer no it&#39;s I&#39;ve (0:41 - 0:47)
complained about this before she has she (0:44 - 0:51)

Bobby here Bobby please tell me you have (0:55 - 1:01)
complaints too uh probably but I am also (0:57 - 1:04)
addicted to the music of Pokemon sleep (1:01 - 1:08)
now which is wonderful at least be cion (1:04 - 1:10)
Beach I should have guessed you would (1:08 - 1:13)
like that one you might not like Topo as (1:10 - 1:16)
much as I do okay okay yeah I might be (1:13 - 1:19)
staying at the beach for weeks to come (1:16 - 1:22)
no you&#39;ll you&#39;ll learn very quickly that (1:19 - 1:24)
the beach has nothing (1:22 - 1:28)
good except the music I&#39;m like three (1:24 - 1:29)
days in the beach and I&#39;m like why am I (1:28 - 1:30)
here (1:29 - 1:33)
oh should have gone to topalo yeah I (1:30 - 1:35)
could have got an onyx I got a I got a (1:33 - 1:36)
Pinsir I didn&#39;t have before so that&#39;s (1:35 - 1:39)
like a plus okay there you go I was (1:36 - 1:41)
getting some iggly buff spawns and that (1:39 - 1:44)
helps I don&#39;t have a good one of those (1:41 - 1:47)
yet all right well we don&#39;t have a lot (1:44 - 1:48)
of news this week because we are (1:47 - 1:49)
recording on a Wednesday because I leave (1:48 - 1:54)
for Florida um on Thursday so uh if I (1:49 - 1:58)
saw you great thanks awesome (1:54 - 2:01)
uh I&#39;m sure it was a good weekend (1:58 - 2:03)
I will say though because I always do my (2:01 - 2:06)
disclosures even though it&#39;s like a $12 (2:03 - 2:08)
ticket to attend regionals I do have to (2:06 - 2:09)
disclose the Pokemon company you did (2:08 - 2:13)
provide me with a $12 ticket um legally (2:09 - 2:16)
I have to say that it&#39;s I know sometimes (2:13 - 2:17)
sometimes there&#39;s like YouTube comments (2:16 - 2:18)
of like why does Steve always say the (2:17 - 2:20)
Pokemon company pays for them because I (2:18 - 2:23)
have to legally according to the US (2:20 - 2:25)
government as no matter how if it was a (2:23 - 2:28)
$5 thing or a$1 thousand (2:25 - 2:33)
thing Uncle Sam needs me to tell you (2:28 - 2:33)
guys that&#39;s just what it comes down to (2:35 - 2:40)
so yeah uh I was try to get the (2:37 - 2:41)
disclosures out of the way uh so we have (2:40 - 2:43)
some Pokemon sleep some Pokemon go some (2:41 - 2:46)
Pokemon anime and the Pokemon TCG stuff (2:43 - 2:50)
um this episode so just happens to work (2:46 - 2:53)
out because (2:50 - 2:57)
uh that&#39;s what we&#39;ve been talking (2:53 - 2:57)
about everything that is in scarlet and (2:57 - 3:01)
violet (3:00 - 3:03)
uh let&#39;s just talk with Pokemon sleep (3:01 - 3:06)
there&#39;s not a lot happening um but they (3:03 - 3:09)
did push an inapp update saying 1.5 is (3:06 - 3:12)
coming which is a (3:09 - 3:16)
pretty that means something big usually (3:12 - 3:18)
normally theoretically we just don&#39;t (3:16 - 3:22)
know what yet okay it so their point (3:18 - 3:24)
updates they&#39;re like Point updates are (3:22 - 3:26)
typically bigger (3:24 - 3:29)
or versus like a 2.0 like that would be (3:26 - 3:31)
huge what I think raicho was I could be (3:29 - 3:33)
wrong so feel free to correct me in the (3:31 - 3:36)
comments I think raicho was 1.4 and then (3:33 - 3:37)
there was (3:36 - 3:40)
1.4.1 which was fixing the one thing and (3:37 - 3:41)
then (3:40 - 3:45)
1.4.2 which was fixing another thing (3:41 - 3:47)
yeah and we are on (3:45 - 3:49)
1.4.3 at this point I think that the (3:47 - 3:53)
main thing with version 1.5 was that uh (3:49 - 3:54)
they were going to make it not available (3:53 - 3:58)
to Android 6 anymore was that what I saw (3:54 - 4:01)
Android right that&#39;s eight years (3:58 - 4:04)
old yeah I think it was seven I thought (4:01 - 4:08)
yeah Android seven mhm I heard that like (4:04 - 4:12)
certain flip phones can&#39;t play Pokemon (4:08 - 4:15)
sleep and certain flip you mean like (4:12 - 4:17)
foldable phones oh yes sry I was like I (4:15 - 4:18)
don&#39;t think I need I don&#39;t think I need (4:17 - 4:21)
flip phones Pokemon sleep the new flip (4:18 - 4:27)
my Motorola Razor cannot play Pokemon (4:21 - 4:27)
sleep my l G chocolate just struggling (4:28 - 4:35)
to play Pokemon I had two of those and I (4:33 - 4:38)
loved them you I had the te- mobile (4:35 - 4:42)
sidekick and I loved it nice nice I had (4:38 - 4:44)
a flip phone I was too young to remember (4:42 - 4:46)
what kind it (4:44 - 4:48)
was was it not just a Motorola everyone (4:46 - 4:50)
just had a razor at a certain point at (4:48 - 4:52)
one point yeah yeah (4:50 - 4:55)
yep um yeah certain foldable phones (4:52 - 4:58)
struggle to play sleep I know nothing (4:55 - 5:00)
about foldables besides they like a lot (4:58 - 5:03)
of them (5:00 - 5:03)
now there are some Sam a few there are (5:03 - 5:09)
three three major companies that do them (5:07 - 5:11)
I think who&#39;s the third there&#39;s Google (5:09 - 5:13)
pixel there&#39;s Samsung there&#39;s Google (5:11 - 5:15)
pixel there&#39;s Samsung I think there&#39;s a (5:13 - 5:18)
third didn&#39;t Motorola make a yeah (5:15 - 5:20)
Motorola did and they called they did (5:18 - 5:23)
yeah yeah the flip razor yeah that one (5:20 - 5:26)
oh the flip one yeah you&#39;re right okay y (5:23 - 5:28)
so Are there specific ones that don&#39;t (5:26 - 5:32)
work or is it just uh I&#39;m not sure um (5:28 - 5:36)
I&#39;m not cat just been me (5:32 - 5:38)
uh he&#39;s very mad at me because I won&#39;t (5:36 - 5:43)
play with him um I&#39;m not I&#39;m not sure (5:38 - 5:47)
this episode&#39;s off the rails (5:43 - 5:50)
already okay for Wednesday episode (5:47 - 5:52)
here&#39;s our what&#39;s what&#39;s our speculation (5:50 - 5:55)
here are do we think they&#39;re going to do (5:52 - 5:59)
ente first or suun (5:55 - 6:02)
first (5:59 - 6:02)
what&#39;s the Pokedex order there I always (6:02 - 6:06)
get them mixed up I believe suun is last (6:03 - 6:08)
out of the three in the Pok√©dex order (6:06 - 6:10)
but let me verify real quick yeah yeah I (6:08 - 6:12)
don&#39;t have a poster with all of the (6:10 - 6:14)
Pokemon on my wall right now it&#39;s Reiko (6:12 - 6:18)
and tun is the Okay order then I would (6:14 - 6:21)
guess anente next that just seems (6:18 - 6:25)
Pokedex just Pokedex order yeah but do (6:21 - 6:26)
you think (6:25 - 6:29)
they obviously ente at the beach doesn&#39;t (6:26 - 6:32)
make any (6:29 - 6:32)
sense yeah no no (6:32 - 6:39)
and Ino does make (6:36 - 6:43)
sense Ino yeah but I&#39;m I&#39;m still kind of (6:39 - 6:47)
convinced that if they do it at all in a (6:43 - 6:50)
non- Green Green Grass Island they will (6:47 - 6:52)
also have an option for green (6:50 - 6:55)
grass I&#39;m not convinced they would do an (6:52 - 6:59)
event just on a non- Green Green Grass (6:55 - 7:00)
Island (6:59 - 7:02)
I it would be nice (7:00 - 7:05)
to (7:02 - 7:08)
see like oh ente is here you can either (7:05 - 7:09)
choose green grass or you can choose (7:08 - 7:14)
topalo yeah that kind of thing um but (7:09 - 7:15)
one is harder than the other when it (7:14 - 7:17)
comes (7:15 - 7:21)
to but does powering up so as someone (7:17 - 7:23)
who wasn&#39;t really playing well didn&#39;t (7:21 - 7:26)
play at all before the REO event did do (7:23 - 7:28)
the did the spawns change on green grass (7:26 - 7:31)
before the REO event event or are there (7:28 - 7:33)
still only specific things that are (7:31 - 7:35)
going to spawn on green grass regardless (7:33 - 7:38)
of like whether there was a REO event or (7:35 - 7:42)
not riko didn&#39;t bring any unique spawns (7:38 - 7:46)
to Green Grass I guess it did like (7:42 - 7:47)
slightly increased the chance of (7:46 - 7:50)
electric Pokemon okay but those all (7:47 - 7:51)
those electric Pokemon were already (7:50 - 7:53)
available to be found on green grass (7:51 - 7:57)
prior to REO so if ente came to Green (7:53 - 8:00)
Grass it would be the same this like (7:57 - 8:02)
most likely the same Pokemon would be (8:00 - 8:04)
able to show up along with ente on green (8:02 - 8:06)
grass it wouldn&#39;t be and maybe they (8:04 - 8:08)
boost something but like the ones that (8:06 - 8:09)
were already there would stay would (8:08 - 8:11)
probably be the ones that would spawn (8:09 - 8:13)
fire Pokemon are even on green grass (8:11 - 8:14)
besides (8:13 - 8:18)
Charmander so you get an influx of (8:14 - 8:21)
charm no uh yeah I think R&#39;s on green (8:18 - 8:23)
grass yeah I think (8:21 - 8:28)
so okay then have they done um in the (8:23 - 8:30)
past where there&#39;s like U an event but (8:28 - 8:32)
it it&#39;s (8:30 - 8:36)
multiple yeah yeah there was (8:32 - 8:38)
the there was the event where they (8:36 - 8:40)
introduced to den and they also (8:38 - 8:43)
introduced some Pokemon from lapis and (8:40 - 8:44)
you could that was the week that lapis (8:43 - 8:46)
opened well lapis technically opened I (8:44 - 8:49)
think like three days beforehand um or (8:46 - 8:51)
something like that where like it opened (8:49 - 8:52)
midweek and like people jumped to it (8:51 - 8:54)
midweek which (8:52 - 8:58)
was those hardcore players yeah um and (8:54 - 9:00)
then when that event started you could (8:58 - 9:02)
either go to green grass or you could go (9:00 - 9:04)
to lapis got it I don&#39;t (9:02 - 9:07)
think there was a very small percentage (9:04 - 9:09)
of players that had that choice because (9:07 - 9:10)
you have to be pretty far in the game to (9:09 - 9:13)
have lapis unlocked so you were kind of (9:10 - 9:16)
forced there was also a week where they (9:13 - 9:19)
boosted Shiny Pokemon and there was like (9:16 - 9:22)
six Pokemon that were shiny I like spent (9:19 - 9:23)
way too long in a YouTube thumbnail (9:22 - 9:26)
about it and then that YouTube thumbnail (9:23 - 9:28)
ended up being a very bad click thing (9:26 - 9:31)
for YouTube uh for the podcast but it (9:28 - 9:33)
was like Absol (9:31 - 9:35)
Jigglypuff um (9:33 - 9:38)
Pinsir and then like three other Pokemon (9:35 - 9:39)
that had increased shiny and you could (9:38 - 9:42)
go to any Island but some islands like (9:39 - 9:46)
topalo spawned none of those Pokemon so (9:42 - 9:48)
there was no point in going to top (9:46 - 9:50)
Hollow and then like green grass spawned (9:48 - 9:53)
all of them but like if people wanted (9:50 - 9:55)
Absol they were like just Absol you (9:53 - 9:57)
would go to like Tundra it was like (9:55 - 9:59)
really weird like it was technically (9:57 - 10:01)
every Island (9:59 - 10:05)
but they were not equal in any by any (10:01 - 10:07)
means (10:05 - 10:11)
yeah but it was nice you got the (10:07 - 10:11)
choice I sad that I missed a shiny event (10:11 - 10:18)
I hope they bring one around again you (10:14 - 10:21)
haven&#39;t gotten any shinies yet right no (10:18 - 10:24)
okay interesting I call myself a shiny (10:21 - 10:27)
Hunter all my shinies are (10:24 - 10:32)
bad yeah and I don&#39;t even have that (10:27 - 10:35)
many if they introduced to Den with (10:32 - 10:37)
raicho (10:35 - 10:39)
technically like Den was like the new (10:37 - 10:41)
Pokemon like a week before raicho came (10:39 - 10:43)
out or whatever or two weeks two weeks (10:41 - 10:46)
yeah (10:43 - 10:48)
okay I I would assume they would maybe (10:46 - 10:50)
do like a new fire Pokemon I don&#39;t know (10:48 - 10:54)
what that would be like Po (10:50 - 10:54)
Ponyta that one would be popular what (10:55 - 11:02)
other popular fire type Pok√©mon would (10:58 - 11:04)
they have that would look cute when (11:02 - 11:05)
asleep because I think that&#39;s another (11:04 - 11:07)
factor I think people will be surprised (11:05 - 11:10)
how cute Volcarona can look (11:07 - 11:10)
sleeping do we have any Gen 5 (11:12 - 11:15)
[Music] (11:14 - 11:18)
pokemon I mean we have dead is Gen six (11:15 - 11:23)
and Glade is Gen four SOA unconfirmed no (11:18 - 11:28)
Unova Pokemon in Pokemon sleep how (11:23 - 11:30)
sad I actually don&#39;t think there is any (11:28 - 11:33)
Unova Pokemon they&#39;re saving it for (11:30 - 11:36)
Pokemon sleep black and white where it&#39;s (11:33 - 11:40)
only Unova Pokemon yeah only you (11:36 - 11:40)
knowa yeah yeah I I would assume that (11:43 - 11:49)
this 1.5 is getting ready (11:46 - 11:52)
for the next (11:49 - 11:56)
legendary um also uh before we move on (11:52 - 11:59)
to Pok√©mon go I&#39;ve not used the den at (11:56 - 12:01)
all this past week and I&#39;m regretting it (11:59 - 12:04)
cuz I don&#39;t I think I think Den is so (12:01 - 12:07)
good den is amazing why aren&#39;t you using (12:04 - 12:10)
J you just found thought I&#39;m on Beach (12:07 - 12:12)
and so all my Pokemon it&#39;s like (12:10 - 12:14)
orangeberry peka Berry which is wiggly (12:12 - 12:17)
tough or Beres water Pokemon and then (12:14 - 12:18)
the flying Berry I don&#39;t know remember (12:17 - 12:20)
what that&#39;s called but I have Pokemon (12:18 - 12:23)
that match all those and J Denis doesn&#39;t (12:20 - 12:25)
match so I was like okay I&#39;m go all like (12:23 - 12:27)
I for the first time ever I have like (12:25 - 12:29)
five Pokemon that match all of these (12:27 - 12:32)
nice uh and den is electric not fair (12:29 - 12:33)
right of course yeah Den is Electric in (12:32 - 12:36)
this game okay um (12:33 - 12:38)
and I felt like I was critting once a (12:36 - 12:42)
day with Den yeah I have had a day where (12:38 - 12:45)
I crit every single meal because of my (12:42 - 12:49)
Den or at least in part thanks to my D (12:45 - 12:53)
and I&#39;m I mean my D does not collect the (12:49 - 12:55)
most berries does not collect the most (12:53 - 12:57)
ingredients but that (12:55 - 13:00)
skill is so useful (12:57 - 13:04)
yeah I I have like a slow King and it&#39;s (13:00 - 13:06)
it&#39;s po possibly the best slow King you (13:04 - 13:10)
could you could have uh and to get slow (13:06 - 13:11)
King (13:10 - 13:13)
Tales because it&#39;s the only Pokemon that (13:11 - 13:16)
can get slow King Tales is the slow poke (13:13 - 13:20)
line eventually ditto and slow King is (13:16 - 13:22)
better than slow bro there&#39;s no (13:20 - 13:25)
difference it&#39;s just slow King is like (13:22 - 13:29)
.1% better than slow bro and it just (13:25 - 13:33)
just feels so useless on my team it just (13:29 - 13:36)
oh no like I don&#39;t know how you get like (13:33 - 13:38)
I&#39;m there probably is a better sling out (13:36 - 13:40)
there but my sling matches everything (13:38 - 13:42)
that should be good and it just feels (13:40 - 13:45)
completely useless and I I probably will (13:42 - 13:48)
switch it out for Deni just (13:45 - 13:51)
because it barely gets any berries it (13:48 - 13:54)
barely gets any Slowpoke Tails it has (13:51 - 13:55)
like ingredient Finder (13:54 - 13:58)
M yeah I&#39;m feeling like almost any team (13:55 - 14:00)
I want to have going forward is going to (13:58 - 14:03)
need to have den and Wigglytuff on it (14:00 - 14:06)
just the combination of those (14:03 - 14:09)
two uh yeah you could sub out Wigglytuff (14:06 - 14:14)
for Espeon or the roals (14:09 - 14:16)
line get the rals line is from lapis (14:14 - 14:18)
right you have to get RS from lapis so (14:16 - 14:21)
that is I&#39;m still 16 more sleep Styles (14:18 - 14:24)
away from that oh nice oh I&#39;m so I&#39;m (14:21 - 14:26)
much closer than I was before the Raichu (14:24 - 14:30)
event that&#39;s good yeah I I have an igly (14:26 - 14:32)
buff right now that I know I&#39;m using but (14:30 - 14:36)
I I&#39;m months from lapis (14:32 - 14:36)
probably uh Pokemon go there was (14:38 - 14:43)
actually a lot of Pokemon go news this (14:41 - 14:46)
morning so very convenient thank you (14:43 - 14:49)
Niantic um before we get to the the the (14:46 - 14:51)
news this morning they didn&#39;t announce (14:49 - 14:53)
the April Community day will be Bells (14:51 - 14:59)
Sprout um it is on it is on April 20th (14:53 - 15:04)
so so some people celebrate that day for (14:59 - 15:07)
whatever reason people celebrate a lot (15:04 - 15:09)
of days I think it was like National (15:07 - 15:11)
Doughnut Day the other day but it is on (15:09 - 15:14)
Saturday April 20th from 2: to 5: uh (15:11 - 15:18)
just also a fun fact about bell sprout (15:14 - 15:22)
its Pokedex number is 69 so there&#39;s two (15:18 - 15:25)
there&#39;s no Quin aming yeah there&#39;s no (15:22 - 15:27)
also gets there is a coincidence there (15:25 - 15:28)
is what I meant (15:27 - 15:32)
sorry also gets the move magical (15:28 - 15:36)
Leaf yep whoever whoever planned out (15:32 - 15:40)
this community day with this they they (15:36 - 15:43)
thought they were were they were very (15:40 - 15:46)
excited to bring this commun day to life (15:43 - 15:49)
yeah they&#39;ve been waiting years for this (15:46 - 15:51)
they&#39;re like when is the next time April (15:49 - 15:55)
20th is on a (15:51 - 15:55)
weekend (15:56 - 16:01)
um the news about this isn&#39;t like Bells (15:58 - 16:05)
Sprout being shiny or that it&#39;s on 420 I (16:01 - 16:07)
think the news to take away from this is (16:05 - 16:09)
Niantic is not afraid to still do gen (16:07 - 16:14)
one Community Days well I think at least (16:09 - 16:17)
in our slack there was a poll to ask how (16:14 - 16:20)
many shiny Bells Sprout People had and (16:17 - 16:23)
most people still don&#39;t have many if any (16:20 - 16:26)
I don&#39;t have a single one yet yeah I I (16:23 - 16:30)
have two two yeah and I got them (16:26 - 16:32)
years (16:30 - 16:32)
apart uh yeah it&#39;s definitely one that&#39;s (16:32 - 16:38)
not I don&#39;t think it&#39;s (16:35 - 16:41)
been in anything I&#39;m trying to think if (16:38 - 16:42)
there&#39;s any event that really cuz when (16:41 - 16:44)
it was released it was just released I (16:42 - 16:48)
think during a during some random event (16:44 - 16:50)
it was K tour it got released wasn&#39;t it (16:48 - 16:52)
no no it wasn&#39;t it came out before K (16:50 - 16:55)
tour mhm cuz I have one from cuz I (16:52 - 16:56)
remember I got the day it re relased and (16:55 - 16:58)
that was like the first time I&#39;ve ever (16:56 - 17:01)
gotten like a shiny day of (16:58 - 17:05)

the week you&#39;re talking about Steve the (17:31 - 17:35)
um save the trees plastic sustainability (17:32 - 17:36)
week (17:35 - 17:38)
sustainability the week after the bell (17:36 - 17:40)
sprout Community (17:38 - 17:43)
Day yeah I think it is (17:40 - 17:45)
okay um yeah there you go because (17:43 - 17:47)
trubbish is supposed to (17:45 - 17:50)
be uh and by the way I was looking at (17:47 - 17:52)
the completely wrong bell sprout um my (17:50 - 17:54)
first shiny bell sprout was from July (17:52 - 17:55)
19th (17:54 - 17:58)
2020 so year and a half after I thought (17:55 - 18:02)
it was but that still was prior to Kanto (17:58 - 18:04)
tour so (18:02 - 18:09)
yeah okay so this is April go Fest and (18:04 - 18:13)
then may should be (18:09 - 18:17)
poo theoretically theoretically and then (18:13 - 18:18)
June should (18:17 - 18:22)
be whatever the scam Dragon was last (18:18 - 18:24)
year right it&#39;ll be [¬†__¬†] from last year (18:22 - 18:28)
go a go will be which is a good shiny (18:24 - 18:31)
yeah chin great chiny I somehow got two (18:28 - 18:32)
of them last year during go Fest and (18:31 - 18:35)
neither were from raids like because (18:32 - 18:36)
they were in the wild this that was kind (18:35 - 18:38)
of the first time yeah they did where it (18:36 - 18:41)
was in the wild as well and I got two of (18:38 - 18:42)
them during go Fest so that was they (18:41 - 18:44)
were also in research I think too or (18:42 - 18:45)
maybe it was research but they weren&#39;t (18:44 - 18:47)
only in raids which was there was (18:45 - 18:49)
something else different CU I got a (18:47 - 18:52)
shiny G not (18:49 - 18:54)
raiding yeah but the research was doe (18:52 - 18:56)
five raids or something like that wasn&#39;t (18:54 - 18:59)
it that would not surprise me I I was (18:56 - 19:02)
just not for go that sounds that that (18:59 - 19:05)
feels like the right thing yeah that (19:02 - 19:09)
does uh I feel like they usually because (19:05 - 19:10)
like go Fest isn&#39;t (19:09 - 19:13)
until in July though right I feel like (19:10 - 19:16)
they do the the raid the at least this (19:13 - 19:17)
is how happened like last year and the (19:16 - 19:19)
year before the Community Day for last (19:17 - 19:24)
year&#39;s dragon raid Pokemon is like right (19:19 - 19:26)
after go Fest and I feel like it&#39;s (19:24 - 19:28)
always to remind everyone who just (19:26 - 19:30)
raided a bunch like by the way this is (19:28 - 19:31)
going to be next year&#39;s thing and you (19:30 - 19:33)
just spent a bunch of money for no (19:31 - 19:35)
reason people fall for it every year (19:33 - 19:38)
still I fall for it every year so I&#39;m so (19:35 - 19:41)
close this year if they if they were (19:38 - 19:44)
doing shiny Jang moo at the inperson Go (19:41 - 19:46)
fests at the New York one I would do the (19:44 - 19:50)
raids there but they&#39;re not so they are (19:46 - 19:52)
are they not the shiny&#39;s (19:50 - 19:56)
not the shiny is only at the global oh I (19:52 - 19:58)
see and I&#39;m not going to do it for the (19:56 - 20:01)
global the hyp well antic they forgot to (19:58 - 20:02)
add the shiny (20:01 - 20:05)
symbol no it was announced it was one of (20:02 - 20:08)
the first things that was announced (20:05 - 20:10)
wow it&#39;s a very good shiny it&#39;s one of (20:08 - 20:13)
my favorite shinies and I&#39;m gonna be (20:10 - 20:16)
patient it&#39;s (20:13 - 20:19)
a that is the opposite reaction of what (20:16 - 20:21)
I have whenever any of this stuff (20:19 - 20:24)
happens I am G to try to be (20:21 - 20:26)
patient uh well they did announce more (20:24 - 20:30)
stuff for go Fest speaking of go Fest uh (20:26 - 20:33)
Sendai was sold out as of this morning (20:30 - 20:35)
only Saturday is sold out the pre-sale (20:33 - 20:37)
sold out so they they did allow more (20:35 - 20:40)
tickets (20:37 - 20:43)
um uh the the I don&#39;t know where these (20:40 - 20:46)
people are staying uh because the whole (20:43 - 20:49)
area of Sendai doesn&#39;t have any hotels (20:46 - 20:51)
and anytime I go to a hotel site to (20:49 - 20:52)
double check they&#39;re like the nearest (20:51 - 20:54)
hotel is two hours away would you like (20:52 - 20:55)
to (20:54 - 20:57)
book that&#39;s where to get there on the (20:55 - 21:00)
bullet train every morning yeah right (20:57 - 21:02)
yeah so I I don&#39;t know where these (21:00 - 21:05)
people are are are planning on staying (21:02 - 21:06)
because there ain&#39;t no (21:05 - 21:09)
hotels but they they did 13-hour flight (21:06 - 21:13)
to Japan maybe two hour train ride is (21:09 - 21:15)
not terrible afterward train ride every (21:13 - 21:20)
day I just I do wonder how expansive the (21:15 - 21:24)
like play in Sendai like (21:20 - 21:28)
how cendi itself is not big so like is (21:24 - 21:30)
that going to end to like Fukushima is (21:28 - 21:34)
that going to extend to like I we don&#39;t (21:30 - 21:35)
know what the play area is I think for (21:34 - 21:38)
New York it was like every burrow you (21:35 - 21:39)
could play (21:38 - 21:41)
in um it was like really really it (21:39 - 21:44)
wasn&#39;t just like Manhattan it was like (21:41 - 21:46)
it was like all of New York and I think (21:44 - 21:49)
a little bit of Jersey where people were (21:46 - 21:52)
like yeah I was like across the the lake (21:49 - 21:54)
and I was still getting spawns not like (21:52 - 21:57)
River I think so gave Jersey a chance (21:54 - 22:01)
too yeah got something finally uh they (21:57 - 22:03)
announced the official Pokemon go Fest (22:01 - 22:08)
2024 t-shirt you can um buy it looks (22:03 - 22:12)
like it is shipping mhm um it is a (22:08 - 22:17)
purple with a prism Poke Ball and just (22:12 - 22:20)
slap ncrma right across of it it is it (22:17 - 22:22)
is okay when I say slap it&#39;s not like (22:20 - 22:24)
the image from Bulbapedia which a lot of (22:22 - 22:27)
like merchandise is like yeah what image (22:24 - 22:30)
can we have from Bulbapedia (22:27 - 22:33)
from kenu gamori slap it on charge you (22:30 - 22:36)
$40 um this does look like a new piece (22:33 - 22:41)
of artwork of necrozma necrozma maybe I (22:36 - 22:44)
mean it&#39;s it&#39;s headon which is not (22:41 - 22:45)
usually a Pokemon artwork but they&#39;ve (22:44 - 22:48)
done that of necros before it&#39;s (22:45 - 22:50)
definitely a stock image from somewhere (22:48 - 22:54)
and this is also this is where I have my (22:50 - 22:57)
complaint I said this last year for this (22:54 - 23:00)
shirt for for last year&#39;s shirt that I&#39;m (22:57 - 23:02)
wearing right now they need to move the (23:00 - 23:04)
design up by an inch or an inch and a (23:02 - 23:07)
half I don&#39;t know why they&#39;ve decided to (23:04 - 23:09)
Center the design around the solar (23:07 - 23:11)
plexus that&#39;s not how a t-shirt&#39;s (23:09 - 23:13)
supposed to work here&#39;s my here&#39;s mine (23:11 - 23:16)
from 2021 look how much higher it is (23:13 - 23:17)
like didn&#39;t used to be this this is (23:16 - 23:19)
where it&#39;s supposed to be the design is (23:17 - 23:22)
still too low it looks fine in game they (23:19 - 23:25)
releas the picture of the models in game (23:22 - 23:27)
wearing it and the in-game models look (23:25 - 23:30)
fine the design is one or two Ines (23:27 - 23:32)
higher relative to the in-person t-shirt (23:30 - 23:34)
and the in-person t-shirt is different (23:32 - 23:38)
and it&#39;s wrong so you&#39;re saying a man (23:34 - 23:42)
designed this t-shirt (23:38 - 23:42)
yes (23:43 - 23:50)
yes and it looks bad on everybody as a (23:45 - 23:53)
result uh yeah it looks fine the design (23:50 - 23:55)
is neat the color is different I need (23:53 - 23:57)
more Purple in my wardrobe the it it (23:55 - 24:00)
needs to be yeah the design needs to be (23:57 - 24:02)
higher and it is a light it&#39;s like a (24:00 - 24:05)
lavender it&#39;s like a very light purple I (24:02 - 24:08)
would it&#39;s I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s a yeah (24:05 - 24:11)
Lavender is maybe it it&#39;s not pastel no (24:08 - 24:15)
but it&#39;s a lighter purple MH yeah yeah (24:11 - 24:17)
uh I agree with Hannah that the design (24:15 - 24:21)
is is is is too low I will say Niantic (24:17 - 24:22)
does a lot of things wrong they barely (24:21 - 24:26)
do anything right um whoever they work (24:22 - 24:28)
with for clothing that was a right (24:26 - 24:32)
decision I have I have gotten multiple (24:28 - 24:34)
shirts that I&#39;ve purchased from (24:32 - 24:37)
Niantic and they always just feel better (24:34 - 24:38)
than (24:37 - 24:41)
like shirts from like Pokemon Center or (24:38 - 24:43)
what you get at like Target I don&#39;t like (24:41 - 24:46)
the I don&#39;t know I feel like the Pokemon (24:43 - 24:49)
Center has good quality t-shirts yeah oh (24:46 - 24:51)
really yeah I I feel like the Pokemon (24:49 - 24:54)
Center shirts are too (24:51 - 24:57)
boxy H (24:54 - 25:00)
interesting (24:57 - 25:00)
they&#39;re they&#39;re very they feel like very (25:01 - 25:06)
90s I guess I would say that of My (25:03 - 25:10)
Pokemon world&#39;s 2019 shirt that is (25:06 - 25:13)
boxier and a sturdier fabric mhm it is (25:10 - 25:15)
stdi too the ones that I&#39;ve gotten from (25:13 - 25:17)
the Pokemon Center are usually closer to (25:15 - 25:20)
what I get from Niantic which is kind of (25:17 - 25:21)
a really (25:20 - 25:25)
comfortable fabric yep that just kind of (25:21 - 25:26)
you take it out of the packaging and go (25:25 - 25:28)
oh this is this feels like a high (25:26 - 25:32)
quality shirt mhm yeah I agree I will (25:28 - 25:33)
say I do have a couple shirts from (25:32 - 25:36)
Pokemon Center that are a little bit (25:33 - 25:39)
boxier a little bit uh they fit kind of (25:36 - 25:43)
weird but I would say Niantic like to (25:39 - 25:45)
Steve&#39;s point is like the best shirts (25:43 - 25:47)
I&#39;ve ever worn for the way I like to (25:45 - 25:51)
wear my shirts they fit just right and (25:47 - 25:53)
then Pokemon Center I feel like a second (25:51 - 25:55)
to that with their shirts like I do (25:53 - 25:57)
really enjoy um the Pokemon Center (25:55 - 26:01)
shirts as well but yeah Niantic I for (25:57 - 26:03)
some reason I didn&#39;t buy the 2023 goest (26:01 - 26:05)
shirt last year but I will say it is (26:03 - 26:08)
still available at least in some sizes (26:05 - 26:09)
so I was able to pick up one of those (26:08 - 26:13)
today along with the the 2024 shirt but (26:09 - 26:14)
yeah Niantic (26:13 - 26:17)
shirts they&#39;re doing it right maybe they (26:14 - 26:20)
should move to selling more clothing the (26:17 - 26:23)
structure is right the design right (26:20 - 26:25)
there is still yes there are definitely (26:23 - 26:27)
still because it&#39;s not an antic without (26:25 - 26:29)
an issue right like you got to have (26:27 - 26:31)
something yeah I don&#39;t know (26:29 - 26:34)
what like sure it&#39;s it&#39;s not even like (26:31 - 26:37)
it&#39;s G Gill gillin or gladian or (26:34 - 26:40)
whatever that one shirt brand is gladian (26:37 - 26:43)
GL gladion uh it&#39;s not like a I was (26:40 - 26:44)
trying to figure out if you were trying (26:43 - 26:47)
to pronounce the Pokemon character no (26:44 - 26:51)
that it&#39;s like G Gilden Gilden I think (26:47 - 26:54)
Gilden I hate Gilden shirts yeah they (26:51 - 26:56)
all feel boxy to me the Gilden shirts (26:54 - 26:58)
always feel boxy to me and they&#39;re not (26:56 - 27:01)
soft at all all mmh also when like S I (26:58 - 27:04)
have made some merch before and like (27:01 - 27:07)
gild Gilden is like the bottom like the (27:04 - 27:08)
the (27:07 - 27:11)
cheapest tier you can get when you&#39;re (27:08 - 27:13)
making a (27:11 - 27:14)
shirt I guess if you wanted to like (27:13 - 27:17)
maximize your profits you would you (27:14 - 27:19)
would go (27:17 - 27:19)
Gilden (27:20 - 27:25)
um yeah I I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know what what (27:22 - 27:27)
brand they use for (27:25 - 27:32)
that uh also announced this morning was (27:27 - 27:37)
ncrma is coming to go Fest in ra it&#39;s on (27:32 - 27:40)
the shirt so I would hope so it is on (27:37 - 27:41)
the (27:40 - 27:44)
shirt (27:41 - 27:44)
crazy necrozma the prism Pokemon will (27:44 - 27:49)
make its worldwide debut in Pokemon go (27:47 - 27:53)
in raids during go Fest Global (27:49 - 27:56)
um (27:53 - 27:59)
and they also updated the website a (27:56 - 28:02)
little bit we see that three star raids (27:59 - 28:06)
will have Espeon wearing a day scarf and (28:02 - 28:09)
Umbreon wearing a night scarf this (28:06 - 28:13)
is different than the Eevee wearing the (28:09 - 28:15)
sun crown or the moon Crown unless (28:13 - 28:18)
they&#39;re not telling us that the crown (28:15 - 28:21)
morphs into a scarf when you evolve it I (28:18 - 28:23)
don&#39;t think that (28:21 - 28:27)
happens that would be new MH yeah the (28:23 - 28:30)
clothing item dram ically changing but (28:27 - 28:32)
the clothing item evolves but they have (28:30 - 28:36)
definitely done uh an Eevee ution who (28:32 - 28:39)
has uh something that the other ones (28:36 - 28:44)
don&#39;t glacon in the like winter Cape is (28:39 - 28:46)
a good ex or maybe the only example but (28:44 - 28:48)
yeah so this would be kind of (28:46 - 28:50)
interesting if they ended up like at (28:48 - 28:53)
some point doing each EV lution has its (28:50 - 28:55)
own unique I mean it&#39;s their way to get (28:53 - 28:58)
people to raid right and like get make (28:55 - 29:00)
Morey on that but it would be kind of (28:58 - 29:01)
interesting for like each Evolution to (29:00 - 29:04)
have a unique costume of its own down (29:01 - 29:07)
the line uh so I I like the I like these (29:04 - 29:11)
ones these scarves on Espeon and Umbreon (29:07 - 29:13)
yeah I mean they are very clearly trying (29:11 - 29:15)
to make sure these are raids people want (29:13 - 29:18)
to do in the one star raids in the three (29:15 - 29:21)
star raids in the five star raids we (29:18 - 29:23)
have the shiny jangmo we have the eeve (29:21 - 29:25)
illusions with the new costumes and we (29:23 - 29:28)
have the shiny enrma so they&#39;re trying (29:25 - 29:30)
to make sure people want to do these (29:28 - 29:31)
raids (29:30 - 29:33)
which is (29:31 - 29:37)
fair things being locked to raids is is (29:33 - 29:39)
a thing but I understand why they do (29:37 - 29:41)
it (29:39 - 29:45)
money it works for them yep I mean to be (29:41 - 29:47)
fair like if you were to purchase the (29:45 - 29:49)
raid lover (29:47 - 29:52)
thing uh which is what like 18 free (29:49 - 29:55)
passes a day and you get it for all the (29:52 - 30:00)
days you play it&#39;s a good deal and (29:55 - 30:05)
even even me who has given Niantic way (30:00 - 30:06)
too much money and is always upset about (30:05 - 30:09)
it and is I would say I would consider (30:06 - 30:13)
myself a hardcore Pokemon go player um (30:09 - 30:14)
sometimes you just get distracted with (30:13 - 30:15)
other (30:14 - 30:19)
stuff uh and you you don&#39;t raid as as (30:15 - 30:20)
much as you (30:19 - 30:22)
anticipate so what I&#39;m saying is like if (30:20 - 30:27)
you purchase the raid lover (30:22 - 30:29)
pass (30:27 - 30:32)
you need to burn your raids on something (30:29 - 30:33)
so it&#39;s nice that you can burn your (30:32 - 30:37)
raids on something that isn&#39;t just like (30:33 - 30:40)
Neato queen or (30:37 - 30:43)
like yeah like DOA like something that&#39;s (30:40 - 30:45)
like oh why why is this in raids I don&#39;t (30:43 - 30:48)
need this it can&#39;t even be shiny like (30:45 - 30:49)
it&#39;s cool that like this is a new (30:48 - 30:52)
Pokemon it can be shiny well a new (30:49 - 30:55)
costume it can be shiny um it seems easy (30:52 - 30:57)
enough to do for people that are like I (30:55 - 30:59)
bought the raid lover pass there&#39;s only (30:57 - 31:02)
like me and one other person we can&#39;t do (30:59 - 31:05)
stakataka so stakataka is not even in (31:02 - 31:08)
the game can&#39;t do uh we can&#39;t do tapu (31:05 - 31:10)
with two people but we can at least do (31:08 - 31:13)
Espeon wearing a des scarf (31:10 - 31:16)
so like yes it is money grabby but also (31:13 - 31:17)
it (31:16 - 31:20)
is it feels more respectful of people (31:17 - 31:24)
who purchased a raid lover who maybe (31:20 - 31:26)
don&#39;t care to do the alra Beast because (31:24 - 31:29)
they already got them or they don&#39;t have (31:26 - 31:32)
people to do them or they like let&#39;s be (31:29 - 31:33)
honest here Espeon and Umbreon are (31:32 - 31:36)
incredibly popular Pokemon (31:33 - 31:40)
right Umbreon is at least as is less so (31:36 - 31:42)
but still very popular not as popular as (31:40 - 31:45)
Umbreon though okay (31:42 - 31:48)
fine uh I will say I&#39;m surprised they (31:45 - 31:50)
haven&#39;t leaned into that a little more (31:48 - 31:52)
with the one star they one star has (31:50 - 31:54)
always been kind of fine right because (31:52 - 31:58)
they will throw easier Pokemon who are (31:54 - 31:59)
Maybe were shinies things like that into (31:58 - 32:02)
a onear raid um five-star raids have (31:59 - 32:04)
been five star raids forever and then (32:02 - 32:05)
three star raids have always had that (32:04 - 32:08)
weird Middle Ground where most of the (32:05 - 32:11)
time they&#39;re bad they aren&#39;t worth doing (32:08 - 32:14)
and they are if you are looking for very (32:11 - 32:17)
specific things but and for a while the (32:14 - 32:19)
thing they did with three star raids was (32:17 - 32:21)
they put Pokemon in there that were (32:19 - 32:23)
strong against the festar raids so if (32:21 - 32:25)
you didn&#39;t have a Pokemon to battle the (32:23 - 32:26)
five star raids you could do a three (32:25 - 32:29)
star raid and get a Pokemon for the five (32:26 - 32:32)
star raid from that that was for a long (32:29 - 32:35)
time the gimmick with that the problem (32:32 - 32:38)
is that most people don&#39;t a lot of (32:35 - 32:40)
people don&#39;t need those Pokemon right (32:38 - 32:43)
and I think that there is something to (32:40 - 32:46)
putting Pokemon that are popular but (32:43 - 32:48)
also ones that can be shiny because (32:46 - 32:50)
there for a long time they&#39;re like you (32:48 - 32:52)
there weren&#39;t shiny Pokemon in three (32:50 - 32:54)
star raids it would almost never be like (32:52 - 32:55)
a shiny something that could be shiny in (32:54 - 32:58)
a three star raid um but things that (32:55 - 33:02)
allow people to solo raid or just raid (32:58 - 33:04)
with one other person because like you (33:02 - 33:06)
said like sometimes you don&#39;t have five (33:04 - 33:08)
or six people to raid with to do the (33:06 - 33:10)
five-star raids so they&#39;re not you know (33:08 - 33:12)
so maybe you can&#39;t get those festar (33:10 - 33:13)
raids but put something in three star (33:12 - 33:15)
raids that&#39;s also popular also fun to (33:13 - 33:17)
want to raid and you can raid with one (33:15 - 33:20)
or two people and it feels like they (33:17 - 33:21)
haven&#39;t really done that in the past and (33:20 - 33:23)
then but seeing this like oh that&#39;s (33:21 - 33:26)
Umbreon with a moon scarf like people (33:23 - 33:28)
love Umbreon it can also be shin it&#39;s (33:26 - 33:30)
got a new costume it&#39;s in three star (33:28 - 33:32)
raids I don&#39;t have friends to raid with (33:30 - 33:33)
but cool I can do this on my own or just (33:32 - 33:35)
grab one other person to to raid with (33:33 - 33:37)
and I&#39;m surprised that they haven&#39;t (33:35 - 33:41)
leaned more into that outside of events (33:37 - 33:42)
they&#39;re they&#39;re starting to go that way (33:41 - 33:43)
like the three star raids outside of (33:42 - 33:47)
events do have more like shiny (33:43 - 33:49)
opportunity now now that more Shiny (33:47 - 33:52)
Pokemon are in the game but um it would (33:49 - 33:54)
be fun to see I don&#39;t know maybe like (33:52 - 33:56)
more I I like I love costumed Pokemon so (33:54 - 33:58)
if they wanted to like start adding more (33:56 - 34:01)
I know that&#39;s a real controversial thing (33:58 - 34:04)
because some people hate costume Pokemon (34:01 - 34:06)
but I just think it&#39;d be interesting to (34:04 - 34:08)
have them lean into more fun three star (34:06 - 34:10)
raids for especially for people who (34:08 - 34:13)
don&#39;t have groups of five or six to do (34:10 - 34:14)
those five-star (34:13 - 34:18)
raids I will say I also prefer it when (34:14 - 34:21)
they also have an opportunity to get (34:18 - 34:25)
those newer Pokemon or more exciting (34:21 - 34:26)
Pokemon in (34:25 - 34:28)
research as well as in r raids (34:26 - 34:31)
especially research that isn&#39;t win five (34:28 - 34:33)
raids um but that&#39;s (34:31 - 34:36)
rare that doesn&#39;t usually happen that&#39;s (34:33 - 34:39)
the worst when when the research is it&#39;s (34:36 - 34:41)
like oh it&#39;s not in raids that&#39;s great (34:39 - 34:43)
it&#39;s going to be in research research (34:41 - 34:46)
win three raids that&#39;s worse you should (34:43 - 34:49)
have just put it in raids yep yeah did (34:46 - 34:51)
they say I know like if you if you go to (34:49 - 34:54)
the global page and you hit learn more (34:51 - 34:56)
you can see like everything that&#39;s (34:54 - 34:57)
supposed to (34:56 - 35:00)
be spawning like one star raids is (34:57 - 35:02)
Pikachu Pikachu Jango three star raids (35:00 - 35:04)
are the Umbreon Espeon five star raids (35:02 - 35:07)
are niggo buzwell fosa zerat Tre celesa (35:04 - 35:09)
Cartana guzzlord and (35:07 - 35:11)
necrozma (35:09 - 35:14)
um is there not going to be like a day (35:11 - 35:15)
and night theme at the Goof Fest like (35:14 - 35:19)
they did for cotour where it was um (35:15 - 35:22)
current time and then like the the the (35:19 - 35:26)
ultra Distortion the the SpaceTime (35:22 - 35:28)
Distortion so they like a half hour of (35:26 - 35:30)
non-space time and then a half hour of (35:28 - 35:33)
SpaceTime space time anomaly in Pokemon (35:30 - 35:38)
go yeah anomally not the Distortion um (35:33 - 35:40)
there&#39;s a reason for (35:38 - 35:42)
[Laughter] (35:40 - 35:45)
that so would like Pikachu and the moon (35:42 - 35:47)
Crown appear at like the night and then (35:45 - 35:49)
Pikachu with the sun Crown during the (35:47 - 35:51)
day and then I would assume some Ultra (35:49 - 35:53)
Beast would be at night and some would (35:51 - 35:55)
be during the day otherwise that just (35:53 - 35:56)
seems (35:55 - 36:00)
like it&#39;s too random of when alter bees (35:56 - 36:01)
can come out like the maybe like the (36:00 - 36:03)
most disappointing thing that could (36:01 - 36:04)
happen is like you&#39;re playing worldwide (36:03 - 36:07)
in your city your city only has like two (36:04 - 36:10)
gems they did announce they did announce (36:07 - 36:12)
the four habitats so I think that&#39;s what (36:10 - 36:14)
you&#39;re looking for there the rotating (36:12 - 36:15)
habitats kind of thing and so they (36:14 - 36:17)
announced two habitats being kind of (36:15 - 36:20)
daytime habitats and two habitats being (36:17 - 36:21)
nighttime (36:20 - 36:24)
habitats at least this is on the global (36:21 - 36:26)
news I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s going to be for (36:24 - 36:28)
the inperson ones to similar to how (36:26 - 36:30)
they&#39;ve done it in the past but they (36:28 - 36:33)
have the dawn Meadow habitat The Shining (36:30 - 36:36)
day habitat the creeping dusk habitat (36:33 - 36:38)
and the darkest night habitat these were (36:36 - 36:42)
all generated by AI like give us give us (36:38 - 36:43)
the most (36:42 - 36:48)
generic no I think they&#39;re (36:43 - 36:51)
fine but inside so even even like go (36:48 - 36:55)
Fest or C T La had habitats four (36:51 - 36:57)
habitats you could walk to but inside (36:55 - 37:00)
those every half hour it&#39;s still (36:57 - 37:02)
changed yeah do you so you&#39;re think (37:00 - 37:04)
you&#39;re wondering would they do that (37:02 - 37:07)
something like that for because you you (37:04 - 37:09)
wouldn&#39;t want I mean yeah to your point (37:07 - 37:11)
there are eight different five star (37:09 - 37:13)
raids that could (37:11 - 37:17)
possibly be occurring right right so if (37:13 - 37:20)
there&#39;s eight and there&#39;s four (37:17 - 37:25)
habitats it would break in (37:20 - 37:25)
half maybe (37:25 - 37:30)
yes maybe am I back in (37:30 - 37:37)
yeah I saw like buffering on my on my (37:34 - 37:40)
end okay nothing stopped over here I (37:37 - 37:42)
don&#39;t (37:40 - 37:42)
okay um I was prepared for it this time (37:43 - 37:48)
but I guess it didn&#39;t crash out uh (37:45 - 37:50)
anyways um no I could see I see your (37:48 - 37:52)
point though if like you said if you (37:50 - 37:54)
have a if you&#39;re in a town and there&#39;s (37:52 - 37:57)
like a few just a few gyms what is to (37:54 - 37:59)
say you don&#39;t end up with you know three (37:57 - 38:01)
Cartana right like there&#39;s there&#39;s a big (37:59 - 38:05)
variety of Pokemon like that like of uh (38:01 - 38:08)
five star raids so I know they typically (38:05 - 38:10)
do what are they doing now 30 minute (38:08 - 38:12)
increments for raids so they they&#39;ll (38:10 - 38:14)
switch them out like every 30 minutes (38:12 - 38:17)
typically for these events um for a raid (38:14 - 38:19)
day they do kind of reset the raids (38:17 - 38:21)
every 30 minutes at this point so that (38:19 - 38:24)
if you only have three gyms nearby you (38:21 - 38:26)
and you have three hours to do the raid (38:24 - 38:28)
day then you have six opportunities to (38:26 - 38:31)
do those raids right I think cotor was (38:28 - 38:32)
that way too like all the raids were (38:31 - 38:35)
resetting like every 30 minutes 20 or 30 (38:32 - 38:38)
minutes yeah as well but also Steve I (38:35 - 38:39)
think you&#39;re thinking too much of the (38:38 - 38:42)
in-person events where there&#39;s actual (38:39 - 38:44)
physical locations to go to with the (38:42 - 38:46)
different habitats based on that on the (38:44 - 38:48)
global ones with the different habitats (38:46 - 38:50)
that&#39;s usually based on time at least (38:48 - 38:52)
historically so it&#39;s going to rotate (38:50 - 38:56)
through those over time and yeah the (38:52 - 38:57)
raids are probably going to be broken (38:56 - 39:00)
down down into a different subset per (38:57 - 39:02)
habitat yeah would be my guess because (39:00 - 39:06)
the global cotor didn&#39;t do the did they (39:02 - 39:09)
didn&#39;t do the same 30 minute thing that (39:06 - 39:11)
the inperson LA one did where it like (39:09 - 39:15)
was the back half was the back half they (39:11 - 39:17)
time distortions it was also the same (39:15 - 39:18)
for the Glo I don&#39;t I didn&#39;t remember (39:17 - 39:20)
that for the global one but I remember (39:18 - 39:21)
for the LA one yeah like the back half (39:20 - 39:23)
of the hour was Distortion so you were (39:21 - 39:25)
getting the origin (39:23 - 39:30)
form raids in the front was the modern (39:25 - 39:32)
like the regular dalga and Pia for the (39:30 - 39:34)
LA c tour no yeah they still did the (39:32 - 39:36)
back half because when it when it turned (39:34 - 39:38)
into the SpaceTime anomaly not (39:36 - 39:41)
Distortion uh that was your only chance (39:38 - 39:43)
of getting the horse (39:41 - 39:46)
forms right but in the global tour they (39:43 - 39:48)
that was every hour they switched (39:46 - 39:51)
between like they switched between the (39:48 - 39:54)
SpaceTime like the Hui stuff and then (39:51 - 39:56)
one hour it was yeah in at the global (39:54 - 39:59)
one that was switched per hour but at (39:56 - 40:02)
the LA one it was every 30 minutes yeah (39:59 - 40:04)
it was every half hour that they (40:02 - 40:05)
switched it okay then I am (40:04 - 40:06)
misremembering got (40:05 - 40:09)
it but they could do the same thing with (40:06 - 40:11)
these habitats in the same way they (40:09 - 40:12)
could hourly when they switch the (40:11 - 40:15)
habitat per hour on the global one they (40:12 - 40:16)
could switch okay now you&#39;re going to (40:15 - 40:19)
see uh these because there&#39;s eight so (40:16 - 40:21)
they could do these two Pokemon these (40:19 - 40:22)
two fivestar raids will happen between (40:21 - 40:25)
you know these hours and then switch it (40:22 - 40:28)
every every hour so that it&#39;s not (40:25 - 40:31)
just eight random ones every single time (40:28 - 40:34)
yeah I&#39;m just thinking that (40:31 - 40:34)
like that one was four legendary Pokemon (40:35 - 40:40)
technically two palas two (40:38 - 40:44)
Dias and this is eight Pokemon yeah a (40:40 - 40:47)
lot it is a (40:44 - 40:51)
lot um and they did they say anywhere (40:47 - 40:55)
whether Celestia and Cartana would be (40:51 - 40:58)
respective to their regions just shows (40:55 - 41:00)
them both it just shows them in the pool (40:58 - 41:04)
of if if they&#39;re not which is (41:00 - 41:07)
fine well not fine it&#39;s would be (41:04 - 41:10)
expected um that&#39;s like seven Pokemon (41:07 - 41:12)
instead of eight and eight fits into (41:10 - 41:15)
four a lot (41:12 - 41:17)
better if they are saying like oh Nigo (41:15 - 41:20)
and buzwell is the first habitat and fos (41:17 - 41:23)
and zerry is the second one like yeah I (41:20 - 41:27)
could see them having them all and and (41:23 - 41:29)
kind of doing with the hemisphere thing (41:27 - 41:31)
for for this event just cuz it&#39;s just (41:29 - 41:33)
cuz it&#39;s go Fest I could see them yeah I (41:31 - 41:35)
think I mean like they already milked (41:33 - 41:38)
people at this point they already like (41:35 - 41:40)
multiple times three (41:38 - 41:42)
times they&#39;ve already done the Cartana (41:40 - 41:46)
Celestia milking face multiple (41:42 - 41:48)
times at this point although if they do (41:46 - 41:51)
break these different five star raids (41:48 - 41:55)
down into kind of two two Pokemon per (41:51 - 41:58)
habitat chunks necrozma&#39;s going to be (41:55 - 42:01)
harder to get that&#39;s (41:58 - 42:01)
true the new (42:01 - 42:04)
one well they want people to raid for (42:05 - 42:09)
the new one that&#39;s why they made it (42:07 - 42:11)
shiny yeah that making it shiny is (42:09 - 42:13)
something is interesting because that (42:11 - 42:15)
kind of shows that they do want people (42:13 - 42:18)
to rate it a bunch versus maybe just (42:15 - 42:21)
doing a oneandone kind of thing which (42:18 - 42:23)
would make more sense if they were just (42:21 - 42:25)
introducing it without the shiny well (42:23 - 42:27)
like necros is a weird exception because (42:25 - 42:28)
like (42:27 - 42:29)
it&#39;s (42:28 - 42:33)
not we cannot spend a half hour on this (42:29 - 42:35)
but I would it&#39;s not an ultra (42:33 - 42:38)
Beast so it like it&#39;s a weird exception (42:35 - 42:40)
because it&#39;s not an ultra Beast here (42:38 - 42:42)
it&#39;s not an ultra beast in general and (42:40 - 42:44)
so they can milk necros in a different (42:42 - 42:46)
way they can do necros they can do alra (42:44 - 42:49)
necros they can do Dawn Wings necros (42:46 - 42:52)
they can do dusk M necros so (42:49 - 42:56)
like this being shiny is like here&#39;s (42:52 - 42:57)
your necrozma that&#39;s going to be the (42:56 - 43:00)
worst out of the other four like we have (42:57 - 43:02)
three other necrosmos that are (43:00 - 43:06)
significantly better than this one right (43:02 - 43:09)
so like if they&#39;re thinking how do we (43:06 - 43:11)
get the most money out of our customers (43:09 - 43:13)
they&#39;ll go crazy and spend a bunch of (43:11 - 43:15)
money to try to get the shiny and then (43:13 - 43:18)
guess what we got three more necrosmos (43:15 - 43:19)
in the closet that you&#39;re going to do (43:18 - 43:21)
the same thing for and they&#39;re going to (43:19 - 43:24)
be better than this one well we don&#39;t (43:21 - 43:26)
know how they&#39;re releasing Pokemon that (43:24 - 43:28)
are that few (43:26 - 43:30)
cuz like we haven&#39;t had that yet I mean (43:28 - 43:32)
we had we we did have that we had that (43:30 - 43:34)
for 6 hours and then they pulled it from (43:32 - 43:36)
people because they accidentally they (43:34 - 43:37)
did that but the way they did that (43:36 - 43:40)
wasn&#39;t raids the way they did that was (43:37 - 43:42)
go battle League I don&#39;t think it was (43:40 - 43:45)
supposed to be there no no it wasn&#39;t (43:42 - 43:47)
supposed to obviously obviously they (43:45 - 43:49)
took it away from (43:47 - 43:53)
people but um well well there&#39;s only (43:49 - 43:55)
like what like three Pokemon in the game (43:53 - 43:57)
that like you can change forms that (43:55 - 43:59)
would be like hoopa (43:57 - 44:03)
furu and Shaman Shaman yeah and Shaman (43:59 - 44:05)
and oh yeah so far (44:03 - 44:09)
yeah and then they gave (44:05 - 44:13)
up I I think I think for sure they they (44:09 - 44:15)
just milk the heck out of this they&#39;d (44:13 - 44:17)
give you necrozma and then eventually (44:15 - 44:20)
soal lunala come to (44:17 - 44:22)
raids because they&#39;re just going to do (44:20 - 44:24)
that again CU you can only get one (44:22 - 44:26)
anyways and that&#39;s just easy money for (44:24 - 44:27)
them and then they&#39;re just going to do (44:26 - 44:29)
Dawn wings necrozma and daong wings (44:27 - 44:33)
necros duskman and Dawn Wings just like (44:29 - 44:36)
when white kierum and black kierum (44:33 - 44:39)
come like your current kierum is useless (44:36 - 44:43)
there&#39;s nothing that&#39;s going to (44:39 - 44:43)
like yeah yeah I&#39;m still hoping they (44:43 - 44:48)
will do Adventure effects on some of (44:46 - 44:50)
these Pokemon though I want to see more (44:48 - 44:52)
of those yes yeah I don&#39;t think (44:50 - 44:54)
necrozma&#39;s good enough for an adventure (44:52 - 44:57)
effect but I think like a dust man or a (44:54 - 44:59)
Wings would be those what they would (44:57 - 45:01)
save it (44:59 - 45:04)
for like I I guess I&#39;m a little shocked (45:01 - 45:06)
that they&#39;re going all in on Ultra Beast (45:04 - 45:08)
plus necrozma and (45:06 - 45:11)
not so galio and lunala are not here (45:08 - 45:13)
well they&#39;re not fully going all in CU (45:11 - 45:16)
we still don&#39;t have bevon or stakataka (45:13 - 45:19)
yeah or well I guess we have pole we (45:16 - 45:22)
have pole but like Po&#39;s also not here (45:19 - 45:25)
you also can&#39;t evolve pole though so you (45:22 - 45:28)
we only have pole and that was also (45:25 - 45:31)
uh a sad release of that Ultra Beast it (45:28 - 45:34)
was just like here it is step one of the (45:31 - 45:37)
research yep you get po you got it (45:34 - 45:39)
you&#39;re good we don&#39;t need to worry about (45:37 - 45:42)
it any longer well I guess like Po makes (45:39 - 45:43)
sense in that because like in Ultra Sun (45:42 - 45:46)
Ultra Moon it was a gift yeah right the (45:43 - 45:48)
crown Tundra DLC it was a gift in (45:46 - 45:51)
Niantic it was a gift of please play our (45:48 - 45:53)
game please play the (45:51 - 45:56)
season (45:53 - 46:00)
please yeah I guess so I I think that to (45:56 - 46:01)
your point I think they&#39;re going yeah (46:00 - 46:04)
they&#39;ll milk necrozma for years I&#39;m sure (46:01 - 46:07)
just like they do with everything else (46:04 - 46:11)
but I do think and again I think solo (46:07 - 46:15)
and lunat will l w I can talk lunala (46:11 - 46:19)
will also come back in raids when (46:15 - 46:21)
probably when it can be shiny uh I would (46:19 - 46:23)
imagine like they&#39;ll they&#39;ll bring them (46:21 - 46:25)
that&#39;s when you could probably get a (46:23 - 46:29)
shiny one will be in raids um but yeah I (46:25 - 46:30)
they I don&#39;t know they still need to (46:29 - 46:33)
give us a fourth cosmog so I can finish (46:30 - 46:35)
the line because right now I don&#39;t have (46:33 - 46:38)
lunala because I don&#39;t want to evolve my (46:35 - 46:42)
my Cosmo until I have a fourth (46:38 - 46:48)
one one day maybe maybe one day (46:42 - 46:50)
maybe I don&#39;t think a lot of raids is (46:48 - 46:53)
necessarily bad I do remember the the (46:50 - 46:54)
one year where they were like every (46:53 - 46:56)
legendary is coming back to raids and (46:54 - 46:59)
that was like one through three or (46:56 - 47:02)
something that was a go (46:59 - 47:06)
Fest yeah that was a go Fest yeah that (47:02 - 47:10)
was I think it was the second Global one (47:06 - 47:11)
the (47:10 - 47:15)
20201 go Fest okay and I just remember (47:11 - 47:17)
that being like a really good raid day (47:15 - 47:20)
it felt like fresh cuz like if if even (47:17 - 47:22)
if you think about the last one with (47:20 - 47:24)
with the c tour it was (47:22 - 47:27)
like do you have Diaga do you have palia (47:24 - 47:29)
do you have the Diga that looks like a (47:27 - 47:31)
horse or the palia that looks like a (47:29 - 47:34)
horse all right you&#39;re done whereas it (47:31 - 47:36)
was like the (47:34 - 47:41)
birds the beasts I think meww was there (47:36 - 47:46)
Lugia ho oh Groudon Kyogre laas (47:41 - 47:49)
Latios they made a whole day out of that (47:46 - 47:51)
didn&#39;t they like they did in past they (47:49 - 47:53)
were like okay Saturday is this kind of (47:51 - 47:55)
like is kind of more focused toward (47:53 - 47:58)
story and catch ing things and then (47:55 - 48:01)
Sunday is like raid day it&#39;s like go (47:58 - 48:03)
Fest raid day yeah okay I do remember (48:01 - 48:05)
that yeah they they they made like a an (48:03 - 48:09)
event out of that I mean I will say on (48:05 - 48:11)
the (48:09 - 48:16)
um on the uh sorry the uh website for (48:11 - 48:20)
the Sunday on go Fest it does also have (48:16 - 48:21)
like like Sunday is a little bit (48:20 - 48:25)
different than Saturday in that Sunday (48:21 - 48:26)
it says there won&#39;t be any actual (48:25 - 48:29)
rotating habitat hours so on Sunday all (48:26 - 48:32)
the Pokemon will just appear throughout (48:29 - 48:35)
the day so that&#39;s a normal thing too I (48:32 - 48:38)
could see them doing Saturday rotating (48:35 - 48:42)
habitats with the raids rotating and (48:38 - 48:45)
then Sunday you could have all eight of (48:42 - 48:47)
the five-star raids Just Happening (48:45 - 48:49)
throughout the day as well which would (48:47 - 48:51)
kind of get both sides satisfied there (48:49 - 48:54)
where maybe you&#39;ll be able to stack up (48:51 - 48:56)
on the croso that day if you want we (48:54 - 48:58)
don&#39;t think like this go Fest isn&#39;t (48:56 - 48:59)
going to give us like this is going to (48:58 - 49:01)
be our fourth (48:59 - 49:04)
cosmog like is that probably not going (49:01 - 49:06)
to be part of the story research that (49:04 - 49:09)
they do maybe but they&#39;ve been pushing (49:06 - 49:10)
Mar Shadow and everything so I feel like (49:09 - 49:12)
they&#39;re going to focus more that way and (49:10 - 49:15)
then raids like Ultra beasts and things (49:12 - 49:17)
for like legendary Ultra Beasts for (49:15 - 49:19)
raids versus thank you (49:17 - 49:22)
for disclosing that they&#39;re not all (49:19 - 49:25)
Ultra Beast here switched that for (49:22 - 49:29)
you uh all although necros in the video (49:25 - 49:31)
that Niantic posted this morning necma (49:29 - 49:34)
comes out of an ultra Wormhole it does (49:31 - 49:36)
okay so so Gail this is so Galo and (49:34 - 49:39)
lunala can open an ultra Wormhole too (49:36 - 49:42)
but they&#39;re not Ultra beasts true that&#39;s (49:39 - 49:46)
true that&#39;s true that&#39;s true uh yeah (49:42 - 49:48)
what yeah they are from Ultra space (49:46 - 49:52)
which I understand they should do is (49:48 - 49:54)
yeah they should switch it so that we (49:52 - 49:56)
are traveling through Ultra space during (49:54 - 49:59)
go Fest switch up the whole thing the (49:56 - 50:02)
whole map and have like a half hour at a (49:59 - 50:04)
time we&#39;re traveling through Ultra space (50:02 - 50:06)
to go get those Ultra beasts they&#39;ve (50:04 - 50:07)
been doing a lot of new encounter (50:06 - 50:09)
screens but I don&#39;t think they&#39;re up for (50:07 - 50:12)
that yeah the real test will be to see (50:09 - 50:14)
if they bring Beast balls back and to (50:12 - 50:17)
see if they use the Beast balls for (50:14 - 50:19)
necros this was my biggest complain (50:17 - 50:21)
because that would be because it (50:19 - 50:24)
wouldn&#39;t work we know that the beastball (50:21 - 50:26)
doesn&#39;t work on necrozma that&#39;s part of (50:24 - 50:28)
the reason why it&#39;s not an ultra Beast (50:26 - 50:31)
here&#39;s 30 minutes of me complaining (50:28 - 50:33)
number one necrozma does not have Beast (50:31 - 50:35)
boost every single Ultra Beast has Beast (50:33 - 50:38)
Boost number two the Beast ball does not (50:35 - 50:41)
work on (50:38 - 50:41)
necros number (50:42 - 50:48)
three it&#39;s this is the thing that svey (50:44 - 50:50)
said for the longest time that like the (50:48 - 50:52)
code doesn&#39;t say that it is and then in (50:50 - 50:54)
scarlet and violet they did actually (50:52 - 50:57)
code out that all of these Pokemon are (50:54 - 51:00)
Ultra beast but necrozma Cosmo Cosmo (50:57 - 51:02)
selia lunala they are under the (51:00 - 51:04)
legendary category they did make a (51:02 - 51:06)
separate category for Ultra beast in the (51:04 - 51:10)
video game doul of the ultra Recon Squad (51:06 - 51:13)
says necrozma is like an ultra beast in (51:10 - 51:15)
the anime they say it&#39;s reminiscent of (51:13 - 51:18)
an ultra beast but it&#39;s (51:15 - 51:20)
not it&#39;s (51:18 - 51:22)
it&#39;s even if you don&#39;t believe the anime (51:20 - 51:24)
or the game for whatever reason the (51:22 - 51:26)
Beast ball doesn&#39;t work on it and it (51:24 - 51:27)
doesn&#39;t have Beast boost (51:26 - 51:29)
but yes it is from Ultra space that (51:27 - 51:31)
doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s an ultra Beast also we (51:29 - 51:33)
know in the games that Ultra beasts are (51:31 - 51:34)
very common in their world that&#39;s why (51:33 - 51:36)
when you take the portal to the thing (51:34 - 51:37)
and you get there there&#39;s like a bunch (51:36 - 51:39)
of zerat trees running around and it&#39;s (51:37 - 51:41)
very cute there&#39;s not that world for (51:39 - 51:43)
necrozma soia lunala because they&#39;re not (51:41 - 51:47)
common they&#39;re they&#39;re something special (51:43 - 51:48)
they&#39;re legendary any if anybody wants (51:47 - 51:51)
to go back to any older episode of it&#39;s (51:48 - 51:53)
super effective and clip out where Steve (51:51 - 51:56)
was ranting about necrozma not being an (51:53 - 51:59)
ultra Beast I&#39;m sure there are 15 to 20 (51:56 - 52:01)
episodes where you can find this rant (51:59 - 52:03)
I&#39;m sure at this point you can probably (52:01 - 52:05)
get a good half an (52:03 - 52:09)
hour so okay so nitic if nitic messes (52:05 - 52:11)
this up I&#39;m going to be so mad the (52:09 - 52:14)
beastball does not work on necrozma in (52:11 - 52:18)
order to to bite on this um what is (52:14 - 52:20)
necrozma if not an ultra Beast then (52:18 - 52:22)
Steve as it&#39;s floating out there through (52:20 - 52:25)
Ultras space it&#39;s just a legendary it I (52:22 - 52:26)
don&#39;t think necros is any different than (52:25 - 52:30)
like an eternus or like a (52:26 - 52:33)
Deoxys okay it&#39;s just a legendary that (52:30 - 52:35)
also can travel through that also (52:33 - 52:37)
travels through Ultras space like Soo (52:35 - 52:37)
and (52:37 - 52:40)
lunala yeah I&#39;m not riding my I&#39;m not (52:37 - 52:42)
riding my Kyogre through Ultras space (52:40 - 52:44)
I&#39;m not riding my I&#39;m not even riding my (52:42 - 52:46)
Deoxys through Ultras space look I bet (52:44 - 52:48)
you could ride a Rayquaza through Ultras (52:46 - 52:52)
space or a Deoxys I&#39;m sure they (52:48 - 52:55)
could maybe maybe even a staru or (52:52 - 52:57)
Clefairy they&#39;re from space (52:55 - 53:00)
they&#39;re both from space it says in the (52:57 - 53:03)
Pokedex I&#39;m not making that up we need (53:00 - 53:05)
to take a (53:03 - 53:08)
break we need a minor that&#39;s what we (53:05 - 53:11)
need yes we all right when we come back (53:08 - 53:13)
we got some TCG stuff and some anime (53:11 - 53:17)
stuff we will be right back and we are (53:13 - 53:22)
back from our break uh we have some TCG (53:17 - 53:26)
news uh which I lost here where did it (53:22 - 53:27)
go uh it&#39;s (53:26 - 53:30)
off it&#39;s off Pokey Beach uh there&#39;s (53:27 - 53:32)
supposed to be a special English scarlet (53:30 - 53:36)
and violet 6.5 set to release in (53:32 - 53:39)
August um which is I wonder if they&#39;re (53:36 - 53:41)
trying to line this up with (53:39 - 53:44)
worlds but uh oh it&#39;s right before (53:41 - 53:48)
worlds August 2nd yeah it will follow (53:44 - 53:51)
Twilight masquerade which Bobby was (53:48 - 53:54)
saying Bobby correct me if I&#39;m wrong but (53:51 - 53:56)
this set is coming a little bit quicker (53:54 - 54:00)
than pass sets Twilight masquerade yeah (53:56 - 54:02)
yes Twilight masquerade comes out May (54:00 - 54:05)
24th which is almost exactly two months (54:02 - 54:08)
after temporal forces and they don&#39;t (54:05 - 54:10)
usually it&#39;s usually three months (54:08 - 54:13)
between regular sets and Twilight (54:10 - 54:15)
masquerade is coming out two months but (54:13 - 54:17)
you know it&#39;s just two months between (54:15 - 54:19)
these sets so kind of a quick release (54:17 - 54:22)
but it it makes sense if they wanted to (54:19 - 54:24)
push this one out push this special set (54:22 - 54:26)
out in August they probably wanted to (54:24 - 54:28)
give a little bit of time (54:26 - 54:31)
between um Twilight masquerade and this (54:28 - 54:35)
set so I guess I understand that but (54:31 - 54:37)
yeah there just it&#39;s the cards are (54:35 - 54:39)
coming too (54:37 - 54:42)
quick too too (54:39 - 54:45)
many if this set is coming out right (54:42 - 54:46)
before worlds does that mean people are (54:45 - 54:48)
going to be able to play these cards in (54:46 - 54:49)
at (54:48 - 54:52)
Worlds no that format should be locked (54:49 - 54:54)
by then (54:52 - 54:58)
okay should it should be the key it&#39;s (54:54 - 55:01)
also a special Set uh which is normally (54:58 - 55:02)
like a lot of reprints with like (55:01 - 55:05)
different art so they they would be able (55:02 - 55:08)
to play if the card text was like (55:05 - 55:11)
exactly the same uh but the art was (55:08 - 55:14)
different yeah (55:11 - 55:16)
uh it&#39;s saying there will be an Elite (55:14 - 55:18)
Trainer Box with nine booster packs (55:16 - 55:20)
promo card accessories a new (55:18 - 55:22)
illustration rare with four booster (55:20 - 55:24)
packs three promos code card three (55:22 - 55:26)
Bluster packs promo card mini tens with (55:24 - 55:28)
two booster (55:26 - 55:31)
packs well I&#39;m the thing that&#39;s (55:28 - 55:33)
interesting to me is this new (55:31 - 55:36)
illustration rare collection box that (55:33 - 55:37)
that they mentioned that second one you (55:36 - 55:39)
mentioned because it&#39;s four booster (55:37 - 55:41)
packs three promo cards and a code card (55:39 - 55:43)
I wonder if all three of these promo (55:41 - 55:45)
cards will be illustration rares instead (55:43 - 55:49)
of regular cards uh they this would be (55:45 - 55:50)
the first time them doing an (55:49 - 55:53)
illustration rare collection so really (55:50 - 55:56)
really leaning into the illustration (55:53 - 55:58)
rares since were I mean they&#39;ve done (55:56 - 56:00)
alternate art things and stuff prior to (55:58 - 56:02)
Scarlet Violet but these illustration (56:00 - 56:05)
rares are new to the Scarlet Violet era (56:02 - 56:07)
so be kind of cool if there were three (56:05 - 56:09)
illustration rare Promos in the in the (56:07 - 56:11)
Box just another reason to buy a (56:09 - 56:13)
collection (56:11 - 56:15)
box uh poke Beach is also reporting that (56:13 - 56:18)
there&#39;s uh we know a trademark named (56:15 - 56:22)
Paradise drag dragonia in Japan and (56:18 - 56:24)
since this is the year of the dragon and (56:22 - 56:25)
since (56:24 - 56:27)
old special (56:25 - 56:30)
sets have been Dragon themed for example (56:27 - 56:33)
Dragon Vault Dragon (56:30 - 56:36)
Majesty that this might be like a dragon (56:33 - 56:37)
themed (56:36 - 56:41)
set yeah and those so Dragon Vault came (56:37 - 56:43)
out in 2012 and dragon Majesty came out (56:41 - 56:44)
in (56:43 - 56:47)
2018 and there would be six years (56:44 - 56:51)
between each ah the patterns the Year of (56:47 - 56:53)
the Dragon right no I just mean like is (56:51 - 56:57)
it six is it six between it 2018 to 20 (56:53 - 56:59)
20 when was the last was you&#39;re the (56:57 - 57:03)
dragon 20 not six years ago there are 12 (56:59 - 57:06)
there are 12al zodia yeah so halfway (57:03 - 57:09)
through year the dragon last time and (57:06 - 57:11)
year the dragon the time before that was (57:09 - 57:13)
it year so it was the year the Dragon (57:11 - 57:18)
for Dragon Vault I believe Dragon Vault (57:13 - 57:21)
2012 and not Year of the Dragon for (57:18 - 57:24)
Dragon Majesty in (57:21 - 57:24)
2018 yep as I was saying that I was like (57:25 - 57:29)
there are so many more than six why am I (57:28 - 57:31)
saying six right now there are (57:29 - 57:35)
absolutely more than six y 12 it sound (57:31 - 57:38)
is the it sounds better but we also (57:35 - 57:40)
don&#39;t know how many cards are in this at (57:38 - 57:43)
all no I mean knowing that it&#39;s a (57:40 - 57:47)
special set you know it should be should (57:43 - 57:49)
be less than these regular sets although (57:47 - 57:51)
these regular sets are huge to begin (57:49 - 57:55)
with so uh we&#39;ll see I mean there are a (57:51 - 57:59)
couple Dr Pokemon new dragon Pokemon (57:55 - 58:03)
that haven&#39;t been in the TCG yet (57:59 - 58:06)
so they could this could be their time (58:03 - 58:08)
to introduce those ones to the TCG as (58:06 - 58:10)
well which would be cool if they did do (58:08 - 58:14)
kind of a dragon themed set um and they (58:10 - 58:16)
have been introducing the newer Pokemon (58:14 - 58:18)
from the DLCs already so that wouldn&#39;t (58:16 - 58:21)
be too surprising yeah and uh there was (58:18 - 58:24)
some talk about um because there&#39;s (58:21 - 58:26)
another there looks like there&#39;s um (58:24 - 58:29)
another set coming out in Japan in July (58:26 - 58:30)
called Stellar (58:29 - 58:33)
Miracle um where they&#39;re going to be (58:30 - 58:36)
introducing um uh like Stellar Tera (58:33 - 58:38)
cards and so they were saying they could (58:36 - 58:41)
make this a part of that as well but it (58:38 - 58:43)
kind of seems like it might be more uh (58:41 - 58:45)
dragon related this time around so we&#39;ll (58:43 - 58:47)
see what we&#39;ll see what comes up as time (58:45 - 58:49)
comes on as time goes on but yeah at (58:47 - 58:53)
this point we just know pretty much the (58:49 - 58:56)
first wave of products coming out um (58:53 - 58:59)
which is not you know which is typical (58:56 - 59:01)
with like every special set there&#39;s no (58:59 - 59:03)
booster boxes there&#39;s no single sleeved (59:01 - 59:06)
booster packs uh you kind of have to buy (59:03 - 59:09)
a collection set of some kind in order (59:06 - 59:12)
to get packs um if you&#39;re buying them (59:09 - 59:13)
unless you&#39;re buying them (59:12 - 59:15)
secondhand probably don&#39;t do that at (59:13 - 59:20)
your best interest to to not do that I (59:15 - 59:24)
have had such an itch to play the (59:20 - 59:27)
TCG but then I (59:24 - 59:31)
think G TCG live I was going to say this (59:27 - 59:34)
is the same feeling that I&#39;ve had when I (59:31 - 59:38)
have that same itch I&#39;m like yeah maybe (59:34 - 59:41)
and then oh yeah TCG live we should just (59:38 - 59:44)
we just need to wait until uh pocket (59:41 - 59:46)
comes out yeah I think I think pocket (59:44 - 59:49)
will scratch that itch hopefully of like (59:46 - 59:53)
shorter quicker games mhm yes uh (59:49 - 59:55)
hopefully ideal I don&#39;t know what that (59:53 - 59:57)
looks like still (59:55 - 59:59)
but and hopefully it&#39;ll still come out (59:57 - 60:02)
this year yeah did they say it was (59:59 - 60:04)
coming out in 2024 they did when they (60:02 - 60:09)
announ I forgot okay again I I I would (60:04 - 60:10)
if it doesn&#39;t come out before worlds I (60:09 - 60:11)
would (60:10 - 60:15)
assume like Masters they would have like (60:11 - 60:17)
kiosk at Worlds where you could like (60:15 - 60:20)
demo it or try it um when they when they (60:17 - 60:22)
did that at gosh I think that was the DC (60:20 - 60:25)
worlds where you could try out Masters (60:22 - 60:27)
they gave you like a pin and some other (60:25 - 60:29)
stuff for like waiting in line and and (60:27 - 60:32)
playing it pins all about the pins yeah (60:29 - 60:36)
the that&#39;s that Disney thing just what (60:32 - 60:39)
whatever Disney does let&#39;s copy it (60:36 - 60:43)
successful uh we also got news this week (60:39 - 60:48)
that uh Netflix is getting part two of (60:43 - 60:49)
Horizons (60:48 - 60:52)

than three (60:52 - 60:57)
months uh part two is coming to Netflix (60:53 - 61:00)
on May 10th Leo Roy and the rising volt (60:57 - 61:03)

part (61:12 - 61:15)
two (61:14 - 61:17)
but (61:15 - 61:20)
um yeah quicker quicker than than three (61:17 - 61:23)
months which is which is good yeah we (61:20 - 61:25)
might actually eventually get close to (61:23 - 61:27)
catching up with the other English (61:25 - 61:30)
episodes in places like the (61:27 - 61:33)
UK yeah (61:30 - 61:33)
eventually but they&#39;re good I&#39;m I&#39;m very (61:34 - 61:38)
excited I saw the news this morning that (61:36 - 61:41)
that was going to happen way sooner than (61:38 - 61:45)
I expected and made me happy I did (61:41 - 61:48)
cancel my I did cancel my Netflix for (61:45 - 61:49)
for (61:48 - 61:52)
April so you got the month off but next (61:49 - 61:54)
month you&#39;ll have to get it back again (61:52 - 61:56)
right I expected to have like two to (61:54 - 61:58)
three months (61:56 - 62:00)
off but I guess I&#39;ll I&#39;ll guess I&#39;ll (61:58 - 62:02)
have to renew that&#39;s like a weird (62:00 - 62:03)
conversation with my text guy he&#39;s like (62:02 - 62:06)
Netflix I was I got I have to (62:03 - 62:08)
subscribe (62:06 - 62:11)
business like I&#39;m not watching it for (62:08 - 62:12)
pleasure I&#39;ll tell you that much I&#39;m (62:11 - 62:14)
watching it because I need to know what (62:12 - 62:16)
happened so I can talk about (62:14 - 62:20)
it it&#39;s good though it is good no I do I (62:16 - 62:22)
did like the first 12 episodes of (62:20 - 62:23)
horizon a (62:22 - 62:27)
lot um did not watch them yet but uh as (62:23 - 62:30)
we were saying earlier um my kids do (62:27 - 62:32)
like Pokemon and we&#39;ve been watching a (62:30 - 62:35)
little bit more of the anime so I think (62:32 - 62:38)
now is the time to sit them down and (62:35 - 62:41)
show them Pokemon without Ash wait how (62:38 - 62:45)
how how old are your kids uh six and (62:41 - 62:47)
four (62:45 - 62:50)
yeah I I don&#39;t know kids as age rigns (62:47 - 62:51)
like when does a kid stop like watching (62:50 - 62:55)
like Teletubbies or Barney or my kids (62:51 - 62:57)
never watched teletub or Barney so I (62:55 - 63:00)
have no idea what you&#39;re talking about (62:57 - 63:03)
uh blue is like the your kids watch BL (63:00 - 63:05)
my kids don&#39;t watch blue either what do (63:03 - 63:07)
you mean they don&#39;t watch blue what PAW (63:05 - 63:10)
Patrol no PAW Patrol either they um (63:07 - 63:12)
we&#39;ve been watching spirit rangers spe (63:10 - 63:13)
Rangers is great and they just came out (63:12 - 63:16)
with season 3 yesterday uh and that&#39;s (63:13 - 63:18)
great that&#39;s not spirit rangers podcast (63:16 - 63:20)
but uh that a cuter version of Power (63:18 - 63:24)
Rangers it is no it&#39;s um the characters (63:20 - 63:26)
are Native American and actually all of (63:24 - 63:28)
the casting crew of that show is Native (63:26 - 63:31)
American and they kind of follow their (63:28 - 63:33)
um like different things that they do (63:31 - 63:37)
throughout the um State Park that they (63:33 - 63:38)
uh or the park that not the state park (63:37 - 63:42)
but the park that they um run (63:38 - 63:44)
basically it&#39;s a great show it&#39;s (63:42 - 63:46)
actually it&#39;s great for kids and adults (63:44 - 63:49)
so spirit rangers it&#39;s on Netflix wonder (63:46 - 63:52)
what about Sesame Street they&#39;ve watched (63:49 - 63:54)
like a couple episodes of Sesame Street (63:52 - 63:55)
but they and they read some Sesame (63:54 - 63:56)
Street books (63:55 - 63:59)
but no Sesame Street was never a thing (63:56 - 64:00)
I&#39;m trying to think of the things that (63:59 - 64:02)
my kids my kids don&#39;t watch t they (64:00 - 64:06)
didn&#39;t watch TV for like my son he&#39;s the (64:02 - 64:09)
older he&#39;s six he didn&#39;t watch TV for (64:06 - 64:12)
like the first two years and may two two (64:09 - 64:13)
and a half years and then like my (64:12 - 64:17)
daughter a little bit earlier than him (64:13 - 64:18)
but they didn&#39;t watch a lot of TV when (64:17 - 64:21)
they were really really young (64:18 - 64:23)
so I don&#39;t know I feel like Pokemon (64:21 - 64:26)
Horizons is probably especially good for (64:23 - 64:30)
Gen Alpa gen alpha kids just with the (64:26 - 64:34)
way they are doing uh kind of YouTube (64:30 - 64:38)
sort of stuff is built in and apps and (64:34 - 64:43)
devices and school and the whole Vibes (64:38 - 64:46)
of it feels a lot more connected to (64:43 - 64:49)
Modern children than Ash just going on (64:46 - 64:51)
adventures around the world ever did (64:49 - 64:54)
right right I I know that people are (64:51 - 64:55)
always like Pokemon why are you playing (64:54 - 64:58)
that kids game or that like but there is (64:55 - 65:00)
or like kids show but there is like (64:58 - 65:04)
Pokemon kids which is like (65:00 - 65:08)
for very small I yeah for I don&#39;t know (65:04 - 65:10)
what the age is like if you&#39;re six years (65:08 - 65:11)
old what grade are you in are are you (65:10 - 65:14)
even at school yet my kids don&#39;t go to (65:11 - 65:16)
school home you&#39;re homeo but they would (65:14 - 65:18)
be yeah six years old you&#39;d typically be (65:16 - 65:21)
about first grade first grade okay yeah (65:18 - 65:23)
but they do watch Pokemon so one thing (65:21 - 65:25)
that we do have is YouTube and we have (65:23 - 65:28)
YouTu premium um but so we don&#39;t watch (65:25 - 65:30)
ads but uh we have uh they do watch like (65:28 - 65:34)
stuff on YouTube and the Pokemon kids um (65:30 - 65:39)
Channel on YouTube is wonderful as well (65:34 - 65:42)
uh like it&#39;s a lot of bunch of songs and (65:39 - 65:44)
they&#39;re they&#39;re very it&#39;s very up to (65:42 - 65:46)
date I mean there are Pokemon from Pala (65:44 - 65:47)
and stuff in these videos like they keep (65:46 - 65:49)
them up to date and there&#39;s like all (65:47 - 65:52)
kinds of fun stuff that they do on it&#39;s (65:49 - 65:55)
like you I think it&#39;s Pokemon kids TV I (65:52 - 65:58)
think is I think so yeah and I remember (65:55 - 66:00)
discovering that it existed and I was so (65:58 - 66:02)
surprised because there&#39;s so much (66:00 - 66:04)
content there there so much content (66:02 - 66:06)
there&#39;s so many songs there&#39;s so many (66:04 - 66:08)
different videos and it&#39;s (66:06 - 66:10)
all I mean it&#39;s all from the Pokemon (66:08 - 66:13)
company so it&#39;s you know it&#39;s very um up (66:10 - 66:16)
to dat which is awesome yeah I guess I (66:13 - 66:18)
guess what what I think is like when (66:16 - 66:22)
does a child graduate from Pokemon kids (66:18 - 66:24)
into like the Pokemon anime because (66:22 - 66:26)
they&#39;re very they&#39;re very different they (66:24 - 66:28)
are but like my kids watch both Pokemon (66:26 - 66:30)
kids and the Pokemon anime so at like at (66:28 - 66:32)
this like they switch back and forth (66:30 - 66:35)
like we&#39;ll watch some of the um Indigo (66:32 - 66:36)
like we watched some of a bunch of the (66:35 - 66:39)
Indigo leag episodes and then they&#39;ll (66:36 - 66:40)
just be like oh we want to watch YouTube (66:39 - 66:42)
We want to watch Pokemon like on YouTube (66:40 - 66:44)
and it&#39;s typically the Pokemon kids TV (66:42 - 66:47)
stuff on there so they switch back and (66:44 - 66:50)
forth but um I think I don&#39;t know every (66:47 - 66:52)
par I don&#39;t want to I&#39;m not giving (66:50 - 66:53)
parenting advice that is we&#39;re not (66:52 - 66:56)
turning this into that CU that&#39;s a whole (66:53 - 66:58)
different set of comments I do not want (66:56 - 67:02)
but uh for me kids are my kids at six (66:58 - 67:04)
and four like the Pokemon anime has been (67:02 - 67:06)
fine it&#39;s been it&#39;s been good uh so yeah (67:04 - 67:08)
it wasn&#39;t like they&#39;re they&#39;re they&#39;re (67:06 - 67:11)
too young to like follow or it&#39;s too (67:08 - 67:13)
complicated for them to pay attention (67:11 - 67:14)
like they I remember watching the (67:13 - 67:17)
Pokemon anime when I was (67:14 - 67:19)
six the Pokemon anime didn&#39;t exist when (67:17 - 67:23)
I yeah Ste and I don&#39;t have that same I (67:19 - 67:25)
was at least 10 I was exactly 10 when (67:23 - 67:28)
the PO my anime came out so I was a (67:25 - 67:31)
perfect age I remember crying when Misty (67:28 - 67:33)
and Brock and Ash went their separate (67:31 - 67:36)
ways I was very young then proba also (67:33 - 67:39)
probably also as a 10y old WR with their (67:36 - 67:44)
separate ways uh yeah yeah (67:39 - 67:47)
perfect some other Pokemon anime news (67:44 - 67:49)
well I guess it&#39;s not really anime um (67:47 - 67:53)
but Pokemon TV news uh we never talked (67:49 - 67:56)
about this uh but this was back in the (67:53 - 67:59)
end of February more Pokemon concierge (67:56 - 68:00)
episodes are coming to Netflix which is (67:59 - 68:02)
actually in retrospect is kind of Sur (68:00 - 68:05)
surprising that they didn&#39;t mention this (68:02 - 68:06)
on Pokemon (68:05 - 68:09)
day yeah because it was very popular a (68:06 - 68:11)
lot of people really liked it and the (68:09 - 68:13)
first time they did announce concer kid (68:11 - 68:16)
watch that too was a was a Pokemon (68:13 - 68:18)
day oh was it last year&#39;s Pokemon it was (68:16 - 68:21)
last year&#39;s Pokemon day huh yeah it was (68:18 - 68:23)
yeah uh more episodes of Netflix&#39;s (68:21 - 68:26)
adorable animated series Pokemon coner (68:23 - 68:29)
are now on production uh I am letting I (68:26 - 68:30)
am happy to let you know that we are now (68:29 - 68:32)
working on new episodes of Pokemon coner (68:30 - 68:34)
said the director in a statement to (68:32 - 68:36)
variety this is off variety.com life at (68:34 - 68:38)
the Pokemon Resort will continue please (68:36 - 68:40)
look forward to it uh let&#39;s see which (68:38 - 68:42)
Pokemon come to visit this time as a (68:40 - 68:44)
guest the four the first four episodes (68:42 - 68:48)
premiered on Netflix on December 28th uh (68:44 - 68:50)
15minute episodes introduced Pokemon (68:48 - 68:52)
fans to the Pokemon (68:50 - 68:54)
Resort (68:52 - 68:58)
um and they didn&#39;t say how many episodes (68:54 - 69:02)
or when the second part was (68:58 - 69:04)
coming the first one was four episodes (69:02 - 69:07)
right yeah (69:04 - 69:10)
yeah four very short episodes but that&#39;s (69:07 - 69:13)
not too surprising with playmation stuff (69:10 - 69:15)
yeah no they were they were still they (69:13 - 69:17)
were still very good yeah no they were (69:15 - 69:20)
fantastic MH or they were (69:17 - 69:22)
enjoyable they weren&#39;t Oscar wining you (69:20 - 69:24)
guys right they weren&#39;t Emmy (69:22 - 69:27)
winning were enjoyable they were solidly (69:24 - 69:28)
enjoyable and I think back on them (69:27 - 69:30)
fondly yes I would recommend them to (69:28 - 69:32)
people who want to have just (69:30 - 69:36)
like you know uh four was it an hour no (69:32 - 69:38)
it was 30 minutes each right no I think (69:36 - 69:41)
it was only 15 each okay so if you want (69:38 - 69:43)
an hour of enjoyable TV that is just (69:41 - 69:46)
kind of wholesome and enjoyable very (69:43 - 69:49)
chill that would work yeah very chill uh (69:46 - 69:52)
I think that would be a good they should (69:49 - 69:53)
okay so I was thinking about this the (69:52 - 69:55)
other day cuz I was I was saying how (69:53 - 69:57)
they should have turned poke like poke (69:55 - 70:00)
palago into like a mobile game that is (69:57 - 70:03)
like a almost like a uh farming like a (70:00 - 70:06)
starw valley type like or like a some (70:03 - 70:07)
kind of game like that that&#39;s like (70:06 - 70:08)
Pokemon they could have turned that into (70:07 - 70:11)
a mobile game and made a billion dollars (70:08 - 70:12)
at least I would have spent money on it (70:11 - 70:15)
you would have you definitely would have (70:12 - 70:18)
but uh that like that feeling of like (70:15 - 70:20)
playing the Poke palago thing I feel (70:18 - 70:23)
like Pokemon concierge is like that same (70:20 - 70:24)
feeling you&#39;re like watching something (70:23 - 70:25)
versus playing but it&#39;s kind it&#39;s got (70:24 - 70:28)
that same vibe that same just very like (70:25 - 70:31)
laid-back relaxing um kind of way about (70:28 - 70:33)
it so that is that is my recommendation (70:31 - 70:35)
if you&#39;re going to want to watch if you (70:33 - 70:38)
want to watch Pokemon (70:35 - 70:38)
con I don&#39;t think it was worth signing (70:38 - 70:44)
up for Netflix so watch well you&#39;re (70:41 - 70:45)
going to have to sign up for Netflix for (70:44 - 70:48)
Pokemon Horizons anyways that&#39;s true (70:45 - 70:52)
that&#39;s true I do have to sign back up do (70:48 - 70:54)
you think do you think they should have (70:52 - 70:56)
done it as like a YouTube series then (70:54 - 70:59)
instead like for you poem felt more (70:56 - 71:04)
YouTu to me YouTu not (70:59 - 71:07)
to it felt closer to the TCG what was it (71:04 - 71:09)
called path to the peak oh yeah path to (71:07 - 71:11)
the peak I like path to the peak more (71:09 - 71:13)
than concierge but I think it&#39;s cuz I (71:11 - 71:15)
like used to go to TCG tournaments so it (71:13 - 71:17)
was like really relatable to (71:15 - 71:20)
me and I used to trade pokon I&#39;ve never (71:17 - 71:21)
gone on a res I&#39;ve never been to a (71:20 - 71:24)
resort so just not not relatable at (71:21 - 71:27)
all that&#39;s fair but the beginning is (71:24 - 71:29)
really relatable everything&#39;s going (71:27 - 71:32)
[Laughter] (71:29 - 71:36)
wrong um speaking of uh poke (71:32 - 71:41)
pelo uh and all of that stuff the the (71:36 - 71:46)
online services for 3DS and Wii you are (71:41 - 71:48)
now shut (71:46 - 71:50)
down um what does that mean for Pokemon (71:48 - 71:53)
games I will stress this a million times (71:50 - 71:56)
Pokemon Bank still works they said it (71:53 - 71:58)
would still work it will continue to (71:56 - 72:00)
still work there will be a day where it (71:58 - 72:04)
will no longer work but it it is it is (72:00 - 72:06)
still working now as long as you have it (72:04 - 72:09)
on your 3DS as long as you asked had it (72:06 - 72:11)
before it pulled that because the store (72:09 - 72:13)
went down a year ago and now the Ison (72:11 - 72:16)
services are ceased to exist but (72:13 - 72:18)
pokemon.com (72:16 - 72:21)
support.com support.nintendo.com have (72:18 - 72:24)
clearly outlined that Pokemon Bank was (72:21 - 72:26)
and transporter are the (72:24 - 72:29)
exception can confirm that they they are (72:26 - 72:33)
still working uh you can still trade (72:29 - 72:38)
Pokemon between X and Y to oras locally (72:33 - 72:41)
local trades local battles uh all of (72:38 - 72:44)
that stuff still works if you want to (72:41 - 72:45)
connect with three other people and do (72:44 - 72:48)
the Pokemon Battle Royale and Ultra Sun (72:45 - 72:52)
Ultra Moon you can do that locally still (72:48 - 72:54)
the other thing that still works is (72:52 - 72:58)
Friend Safari still works even if you (72:54 - 73:01)
were to add somebody today so if I was (72:58 - 73:03)
to go up to Hannah and be like let&#39;s (73:01 - 73:05)
exchange 3DS friend codes one we can (73:03 - 73:08)
still do that locally two I would still (73:05 - 73:10)
be able to access her friend (73:08 - 73:14)
safari because Friend Safari is (73:10 - 73:16)
generated before you even start your (73:14 - 73:18)
game I think the only thing that happens (73:16 - 73:21)
is instead of three Pokemon you only get (73:18 - 73:24)
two Pokemon but I actually think you can (73:21 - 73:26)
get around that if you you are still (73:24 - 73:29)
local because the third Pokemon unlocks (73:26 - 73:33)
when Hannah beats the Elite 4 and as (73:29 - 73:36)
long as I&#39;ve do like a trade with her (73:33 - 73:38)
after she&#39;s beaten the Elite 4 that (73:36 - 73:41)
should unlock the third Pokemon for me (73:38 - 73:43)
but regardless you could still go to (73:41 - 73:46)
like a Pax or a c2e2 and you could still (73:43 - 73:49)
exchange friend codes locally to get (73:46 - 73:53)
Friend Safari to work in X and Y um it&#39;s (73:49 - 73:56)
that still works uh would assume that (73:53 - 73:58)
the Eon ticket in Omega Ruby Alpha (73:56 - 73:59)
Sapphire should still work because (73:58 - 74:01)
that&#39;s just Street pass that&#39;s all that (73:59 - 74:03)
is (74:01 - 74:07)
um I have that ticket maybe if I go to (74:03 - 74:09)
Worlds or something I&#39;ll bring my 3DS (74:07 - 74:12)
and Street pass the four people that are (74:09 - 74:15)
desperate for a neon ticket in that game (74:12 - 74:18)
um so there is like functionality and (74:15 - 74:19)
stuff I (74:18 - 74:21)
don&#39;t I don&#39;t think there&#39;s like any (74:19 - 74:25)
ribbons in X and Y or Omega Ruby that (74:21 - 74:28)
are tied to participating online that (74:25 - 74:29)
was only there are not there was only (74:28 - 74:32)
Diamond and Pearl that was (74:29 - 74:35)
one and even there&#39;s like a workaround (74:32 - 74:37)
for that where you can just like connect (74:35 - 74:40)
fail battle a CPU and eventually get it (74:37 - 74:41)
or something like that there&#39;s like a (74:40 - 74:42)
weird work around where you could still (74:41 - 74:45)
get that ribbon if you really wanted (74:42 - 74:49)
to um last week I was like I I think it (74:45 - 74:52)
was last week or the week before I said (74:49 - 74:54)
Oh They&#39;ll probably keep Pokemon Bank up (74:52 - 74:56)
until whatever like I I thought I (74:54 - 74:58)
thought it would stay around longer but (74:56 - 75:01)
I&#39;ve reassessed this this uh thought now (74:58 - 75:03)
that I&#39;ve seen that Pokemon like the (75:01 - 75:06)
website had actually said in the past (75:03 - 75:08)
like while you can still do this we (75:06 - 75:09)
would recommend you do this at your (75:08 - 75:12)
earliest convenience of transferring (75:09 - 75:16)
your Pokemon through bank to home so (75:12 - 75:18)
like you said like it&#39;s still up it (75:16 - 75:21)
still works it&#39;s fine but maybe it&#39;s not (75:18 - 75:24)
going to be uh here don&#39;t know years to (75:21 - 75:25)
come and we don&#39;t know how much time (75:24 - 75:27)
they&#39;re going to give us when they (75:25 - 75:29)
finally do shut it down yeah I mean (75:27 - 75:32)
hopefully it&#39;s not like a day before or (75:29 - 75:34)
something or you know a couple days (75:32 - 75:37)
before down in the next three (75:34 - 75:40)
hours crash everything when people are (75:37 - 75:42)
all doing it at the same time but (75:40 - 75:45)
uh yeah maybe maybe yeah maybe it&#39;s a (75:42 - 75:46)
good recommendation they recommended (75:45 - 75:48)
sooner rather than later so I think it&#39;s (75:46 - 75:51)
probably safer to do it sooner rather (75:48 - 75:55)
than later yeah my assumption is that (75:51 - 75:57)
the thing that would accelerate it to (75:55 - 76:01)
shut down quicker would be security (75:57 - 76:03)
issues yeah mhm and they don&#39;t want to (76:01 - 76:06)
put the time or resources or the (76:03 - 76:08)
Manpower into trying to patch the (76:06 - 76:11)
security issue so they&#39;re just (76:08 - 76:14)
like all right I guess we&#39;re done here (76:11 - 76:16)
yeah so as long (76:14 - 76:18)
as speculation and my fingers are (76:16 - 76:20)
crossed as long as there&#39;s no huge (76:18 - 76:23)
security issue that bothers them or (76:20 - 76:26)
Nintendo it should be fine to continue (76:23 - 76:28)
operating so so what are your what are (76:26 - 76:30)
your thoughts here on this real real (76:28 - 76:34)
quick so like for me I love SOS shiny (76:30 - 76:37)
hunting and so it&#39;s one of the main ways (76:34 - 76:39)
that I shiny hunt and I have it I you (76:37 - 76:40)
know I guess there will be a time if I (76:39 - 76:43)
you know to get everything you can SOS (76:40 - 76:45)
hunt in you know Ultras and Ultram moon (76:43 - 76:48)
but just knowing that I you know at some (76:45 - 76:51)
point once once Bank does shut down (76:48 - 76:54)
which again it is not can still be used (76:51 - 76:58)
today uh but once it does I don&#39;t know (76:54 - 77:00)
that I want to do that because then what (76:58 - 77:01)
am I going to not going to be able to (77:00 - 77:04)
transfer those Pokemon up right so so (77:01 - 77:05)
what are your thought like are do you (77:04 - 77:08)
think you would continue playing uh the (77:05 - 77:10)
older games and just to play them or (77:08 - 77:11)
knowing you&#39;re not going to be able to (77:10 - 77:13)
move those Pokemon up or is it just kind (77:11 - 77:16)
of that&#39;s it for older Pokemon games I (77:13 - 77:18)
think I think this shocks people and (77:16 - 77:20)
it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of like the joke of like (77:18 - 77:22)
me not liking heart gold soul (77:20 - 77:26)
silver but like I I think that the the (77:22 - 77:28)
reality behind that like joke or me (77:26 - 77:32)
teasing older games is I don&#39;t like to (77:28 - 77:34)
go back to older games regardless of (77:32 - 77:39)
that&#39;s Pokemon or Zelda or like whatever (77:34 - 77:41)
right like when I was on the Nintendo (77:39 - 77:43)
podcast I talked about like I had no (77:41 - 77:47)
interest in Final Fantasy 7 remake (77:43 - 77:49)
because I already played Final Fantasy 7 (77:47 - 77:51)
I played it a ton as a kid it was like (77:49 - 77:54)
the one it was like the one game I had (77:51 - 77:56)
and I played it over and over and I I (77:54 - 77:59)
know what happens in that story with (77:56 - 78:01)
Pokemon I don&#39;t think I would be here on (77:59 - 78:05)
a Pokemon podcast or care about Pokemon (78:01 - 78:06)
like I would still like Pokemon (78:05 - 78:07)
obviously I would still care about (78:06 - 78:10)
Pokemon but the only reason I go back to (78:07 - 78:13)
old games or want to buy old games or (78:10 - 78:17)
like have 3DS&#39;s and DS&#39;s and Link cables (78:13 - 78:19)
and all that stuff is because it is the (78:17 - 78:22)
one video game series that you can (78:19 - 78:25)
continue transferring things forward mhm (78:22 - 78:28)
and so like I&#39;m playing let&#39;s go Pikachu (78:25 - 78:30)
let&#39;s go Eevee right now which isn&#39;t (78:28 - 78:32)
even that old of a game and I&#39;m loving (78:30 - 78:34)
it but also I know at the end of that (78:32 - 78:37)
Journey the like eight Pokemon or (78:34 - 78:40)
whatever that I end up getting I can (78:37 - 78:42)
move them forward like I caught a shiny (78:40 - 78:44)
primeape in that game Mankey evolved (78:42 - 78:46)
into primeape and all I think is when I (78:44 - 78:48)
when I caught that when I was shiny (78:46 - 78:49)
hunting it was like this is going to be (78:48 - 78:51)
super cool this is going to be an nype (78:49 - 78:53)
of one day and it&#39;s going to be an nype (78:51 - 78:55)
that came from let&#39;s go Pikachu let&#39;s go (78:53 - 78:58)
I think that&#39;s so interesting and cool I (78:55 - 79:03)
just like like Hannah&#39;s Blazin M please (78:58 - 79:07)
talk about it home she saf home at this (79:03 - 79:11)
point so cool yeah for sure yeah that&#39;s (79:07 - 79:13)
I&#39;ve mentioned her a couple of times (79:11 - 79:16)
I&#39;ve had that Blazin since I was like (79:13 - 79:19)
seven years old since Pokemon Ruby came (79:16 - 79:22)
out she was my first starter in Pokemon (79:19 - 79:24)
Ruby and as the newer games came out (79:22 - 79:26)
since then I have moved her up through (79:24 - 79:28)
all of the DS games through all of the (79:26 - 79:32)
3DS games somewhere around X and Y and (79:28 - 79:34)
rs I decided to start getting as many (79:32 - 79:36)
ribbons as I could on her and so she (79:34 - 79:39)
kind of got stuck in the 3DS for a while (79:36 - 79:41)
but over the last few work weeks I&#39;ve (79:39 - 79:43)
worked really hard to get those last 3DS (79:41 - 79:45)
ribbons on her and now she is finally in (79:43 - 79:48)
bank and I&#39;m I&#39;m I&#39;m checking bank every (79:45 - 79:50)
day just to say hi to her because I can (79:48 - 79:53)
actually see Blaze again on my phone now (79:50 - 79:56)
um oh but I&#39;ve that Pokemon for more (79:53 - 79:57)
than 21 (79:56 - 80:00)
years and the fact that that is (79:57 - 80:03)
possible is amazing no yeah I think (80:00 - 80:05)
that&#39;s so incredibly cool and like I (80:03 - 80:07)
know I know for sure we&#39;re in the (80:05 - 80:09)
minority of players of like there I know (80:07 - 80:11)
plenty of people who have never (80:09 - 80:13)
transferred a Pokemon forward and that&#39;s (80:11 - 80:15)
fine and acceptable I know people who (80:13 - 80:18)
shiny hunt in Pokemon Crystal and they (80:15 - 80:19)
have no that those Chinese will live in (80:18 - 80:21)
Crystal forever and they&#39;re totally (80:19 - 80:24)
content with that also cool but a huge (80:21 - 80:26)
draw to the series and why like I&#39;ve (80:24 - 80:29)
been doing a Pokemon podcast for almost (80:26 - 80:32)
14 years (80:29 - 80:35)
is there&#39;s like a reason to like (80:32 - 80:37)
actually go back and play older games (80:35 - 80:39)
because you can move those forward like (80:37 - 80:41)
I still I haven&#39;t had time to do it I (80:39 - 80:44)
still want to I have a copy of Battle (80:41 - 80:46)
Revolution I think I have a Wii (80:44 - 80:49)
somewhere um I want to go into battle (80:46 - 80:52)
revolution you can actually get a Magmar (80:49 - 80:55)
and an Electabuzz from Battle Revolution (80:52 - 80:58)
asft Pokemon and you can move them out (80:55 - 81:01)
into the main Series games and that&#39;s (80:58 - 81:04)
like it&#39;s just like I have so many (81:01 - 81:06)
magmar&#39;s elector buzzes shiny Magmar (81:04 - 81:08)
shiny elector buzzes like I have so many (81:06 - 81:10)
but I don&#39;t have some from Battle (81:08 - 81:13)
Revolution and I want (81:10 - 81:17)
that like and that&#39;s that&#39;s why I would (81:13 - 81:18)
if I didn&#39;t have a copy of Battle (81:17 - 81:20)
Revolution I would go out and get a copy (81:18 - 81:21)
of Battle Revolution to be like I want (81:20 - 81:23)
those two specific Pokemon I think (81:21 - 81:24)
that&#39;s so cool I think that&#39;s so (81:23 - 81:27)
interesting the second that&#39;s all (81:24 - 81:29)
disconnected when whenever that day (81:27 - 81:34)
comes of diamond and pearl X and Y black (81:29 - 81:38)
and white they cannot move into sword (81:34 - 81:41)
and shield like that connection is (81:38 - 81:44)
broken I I don&#39;t care about those games (81:41 - 81:48)
anymore they&#39;re just like my memories (81:44 - 81:50)
won&#39;t be gone right like I still will be (81:48 - 81:54)
think very fondly of my time in alola (81:50 - 81:55)
but (81:54 - 81:59)
yeah like I have no reason to own a copy (81:55 - 82:03)
of Pokemon Crystal or Pokemon Yellow (81:59 - 82:05)
because the compatibility is not there (82:03 - 82:08)
yet there was no compatibility between (82:05 - 82:09)
like I don&#39;t think it&#39;s talked about (82:08 - 82:13)
enough of like a lot of people my age (82:09 - 82:19)
fell off on gen 3 and you could say I I (82:13 - 82:22)
think an easy reason is like Pokemon (82:19 - 82:24)
came out when I was 10 so you know still (82:22 - 82:26)
in elementary school early middle school (82:24 - 82:27)
you&#39;re getting like closer to the end of (82:26 - 82:29)
middle school and then high school and (82:27 - 82:32)
like that stopped being cool when Gen 3 (82:29 - 82:33)
came (82:32 - 82:37)
out but a big part of that was (82:33 - 82:39)
compatibility like knowing that there (82:37 - 82:42)
were two new Pokemon games coming and (82:39 - 82:45)
the Pokemon you moved from Pokemon Red (82:42 - 82:47)
into Pokemon Yellow into Pokemon Silver (82:45 - 82:49)
into Pokemon Crystal all of a sudden (82:47 - 82:53)
cannot move like that was such a turnoff (82:49 - 82:54)
and there was no Twitter back then there (82:53 - 82:56)
was no Reddit back then there was no (82:54 - 82:58)
Facebook back then to like go on to (82:56 - 83:02)
complain about but that was a huge thing (82:58 - 83:04)
of like oh maybe I&#39;m getting too old for (83:02 - 83:06)
Pokemon oh and I can&#39;t even move my (83:04 - 83:09)
Pokemon over like I I&#39;m done with this (83:06 - 83:11)
series like I&#39;m I&#39;m moving on it was big (83:09 - 83:13)
enough that they even came out and said (83:11 - 83:15)
after that happened like were they (83:13 - 83:17)
didn&#39;t they I don&#39;t know if they went as (83:15 - 83:19)
far as to apologize but they definitely (83:17 - 83:21)
were like we&#39;re not doing that (83:19 - 83:25)
again they did they they did say that (83:21 - 83:29)
that when they announced like when was (83:25 - 83:32)
that was that Cil games or red leaf (83:29 - 83:34)
green I think didn&#39;t they say that when (83:32 - 83:36)
they because they were like well here&#39;s (83:34 - 83:38)
here&#39;s gen one again and sorry but we&#39;re (83:36 - 83:40)
not GNA make it so you can&#39;t bring those (83:38 - 83:42)
Pokemon up here again right around that (83:40 - 83:44)
time possibly yeah and I think they&#39;ve (83:42 - 83:46)
done a good job (83:44 - 83:48)
for they know that our Pokemon are (83:46 - 83:51)
sentimental mhm they know that people (83:48 - 83:53)
care about the Pokemon that they have (83:51 - 83:56)
shared travels and years and Adventures (83:53 - 83:58)
and (83:56 - 84:00)
achievements I think maybe they didn&#39;t (83:58 - 84:02)
realize how much that would be (84:00 - 84:06)
true I mean there were I this was years (84:02 - 84:08)
ago right so there were whatever reasons (84:06 - 84:10)
that they had for the not being able to (84:08 - 84:11)
bring things forward or just the way (84:10 - 84:13)
that they decided to do things but I (84:11 - 84:17)
think once they got the the feedback of (84:13 - 84:18)
what happened that the feedback that (84:17 - 84:20)
they could from what happened I think (84:18 - 84:22)
they were like oh like people really (84:20 - 84:24)
care about the these characters they (84:22 - 84:26)
want to take them with them all the way (84:24 - 84:28)
up you know so uh and they&#39;ve done like (84:26 - 84:29)
you said they&#39;ve done a great job of it (84:28 - 84:34)
since then you know they as the SM (84:29 - 84:36)
process but you can do it you know it (84:34 - 84:38)
takes a little effort yeah yeah yeah (84:36 - 84:41)
it&#39;s not not super easy but like I don&#39;t (84:38 - 84:44)
I don&#39;t fault them for eventually (84:41 - 84:46)
closing this (84:44 - 84:49)
connection um yeah cuz like if you if (84:46 - 84:52)
you if you have a how old is your Blazin (84:49 - 84:55)
Hannah since Pokemon Ruby came out (84:52 - 84:56)
probably since the day those games (84:55 - 84:59)
released if you have a blazak that old (84:56 - 85:03)
and you haven&#39;t moved it by now to a a a (84:59 - 85:06)
current game like it&#39;s it&#39;s not like I (85:03 - 85:08)
was trying to get ribbons on her sure (85:06 - 85:10)
sure but what I&#39;m saying is they they (85:08 - 85:14)
have given us 10 plus years right (85:10 - 85:16)
they&#39;ve given you a long time to move it (85:14 - 85:19)
forward it&#39;s it&#39;s not like a you know (85:16 - 85:20)
like a Niantic thing where it&#39;s like you (85:19 - 85:23)
got one week to buy this ticket if you (85:20 - 85:25)
don&#39;t buy this ticket you&#39;ll never see (85:23 - 85:28)
this Pokemon again good (85:25 - 85:31)
luck right they they I&#39;m they just given (85:28 - 85:34)
they&#39;ve given a lot and I can&#39;t think of (85:31 - 85:36)
another (85:34 - 85:40)
series that has had so much backwards (85:36 - 85:42)
compatibility like there are people that (85:40 - 85:43)
have been playing World of Warcraft for (85:42 - 85:46)
like a decade and stuff there have been (85:43 - 85:49)
people playing Final Fantasy 14 like (85:46 - 85:51)
there is there are still people that (85:49 - 85:53)
have played Final Fantasy 11 right and (85:51 - 85:55)
that game hasn&#39;t been updated for years (85:53 - 85:58)
years but there there&#39;s nothing like (85:55 - 86:00)
Pokemon where it&#39;s like I have a (85:58 - 86:02)
20-year-old Pokemon that I&#39;ve moved (86:00 - 86:05)
through 16 different games I&#39;ve moved it (86:02 - 86:07)
to X I&#39;ve moved it to Y I&#39;ve moved it to (86:05 - 86:10)
Omega I&#39;ve moved it to ultra Sun regular (86:07 - 86:12)
Sun Ultra Moon regular Moon there&#39;s just (86:10 - 86:15)
nothing like that and I think that&#39;s why (86:12 - 86:19)
I go back to older Pokemon games whereas (86:15 - 86:21)
I wouldn&#39;t go back to older games in (86:19 - 86:22)
general like links Awakening one of my (86:21 - 86:24)
favorite games they came out with a (86:22 - 86:27)
remake did I buy it no because as a kid (86:24 - 86:29)
it was like one of my two games for like (86:27 - 86:31)
four years I had links Awakening and I (86:29 - 86:34)
had Kirby and so I played a lot of links (86:31 - 86:36)
Awakening I like it a lot I have fond (86:34 - 86:38)
memories of it it was really great beat (86:36 - 86:40)
that game a million times did I buy the (86:38 - 86:43)
one on switch no I I&#39;ve been there done (86:40 - 86:44)
that Super Mario RPG they came out with (86:43 - 86:47)
a new one did I buy it no because again (86:44 - 86:50)
another game I played a million times I (86:47 - 86:53)
would rather play new games um but with (86:50 - 86:54)
Pokemon it&#39;s like if I play this old (86:53 - 86:57)
game I can bring this into a new game (86:54 - 87:01)
mhm and uh like I&#39;m I&#39;m super excited to (86:57 - 87:05)
get my let&#39;s go Pikachu annihilate in in (87:01 - 87:07)
a couple weeks when I move him (87:05 - 87:11)
over I do think that it&#39;s important for (87:07 - 87:13)
games to continue to be available for (87:11 - 87:14)
people who haven&#39;t played them before (87:13 - 87:16)
though and that&#39;s a slightly different (87:14 - 87:19)
conversation going back to a game you (87:16 - 87:20)
have already played before and (87:19 - 87:22)
revisiting a remake of a game you&#39;ve (87:20 - 87:24)
played before is a completely different (87:22 - 87:26)
experience from revisiting an old game (87:24 - 87:29)
you haven&#39;t played before like I in my (87:26 - 87:32)
process of bringing blazak up uh (87:29 - 87:35)
realized I never actually finished uh (87:32 - 87:40)
the the ultra Sun Ultra Moon games (87:35 - 87:43)
somehow um I had forgotten that and I (87:40 - 87:45)
need to replay those and that&#39;s I think (87:43 - 87:46)
still going to be a good experience even (87:45 - 87:51)
though that&#39;s playing a game from a (87:46 - 87:53)
while ago at this point yeah I mean (87:51 - 87:56)
there&#39;s the the the easy solution of (87:53 - 87:57)
like (87:56 - 88:01)
put red and blue on the Virtual Console (87:57 - 88:02)
that like well first off they haven&#39;t (88:01 - 88:04)
used the word Virtual Console in like (88:02 - 88:06)
eight (88:04 - 88:08)
years but like put like red and blue on (88:06 - 88:10)
the switch so we can play it and go back (88:08 - 88:13)
to it I&#39;m for that like I&#39;m definitely (88:10 - 88:16)
not against that but if if they were (88:13 - 88:17)
like we&#39;re putting red and blue onto the (88:16 - 88:20)
switch but it won&#39;t work with Pokemon (88:17 - 88:22)
home I wouldn&#39;t get it I would be I&#39;m (88:20 - 88:25)
not interested like I (88:22 - 88:27)
first off those games are kind of dog (88:25 - 88:30)
water at this point but (88:27 - 88:33)
like but like if I can&#39;t go through and (88:30 - 88:34)
be like I&#39;m going to move this Mewtwo (88:33 - 88:37)
from red and blue into scarlet and (88:34 - 88:40)
violet like I&#39;m not interested I I I (88:37 - 88:42)
want that I again I know that&#39;s not for (88:40 - 88:43)
everyone somebody just wants their (88:42 - 88:45)
Nostalgia they just want to go through (88:43 - 88:47)
it because their childhood but like if (88:45 - 88:49)
I&#39;m going back to an old game like an (88:47 - 88:51)
old Pokemon game I want to be able to (88:49 - 88:53)
take what I do in that game and move it (88:51 - 88:56)
forward well I that&#39;s a very Pokemon (88:53 - 88:58)
specific thing yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s the (88:56 - 89:00)
thing that I was going to say is that (88:58 - 89:04)
these games give people options right so (89:00 - 89:06)
if you want to go back and play an older (89:04 - 89:07)
game so you can take a Pokemon all the (89:06 - 89:09)
way through you can do that if you want (89:07 - 89:10)
to just go back and play an older game (89:09 - 89:12)
to just play the older game you can also (89:10 - 89:15)
do that the thing for me (89:12 - 89:19)
is knowing that you can bring Pokemon up (89:15 - 89:23)
now but then when that&#39;s not available (89:19 - 89:26)
anymore it&#39;s like do I want to like I (89:23 - 89:28)
don&#39;t mind playing older games when I (89:26 - 89:29)
know like that&#39;s the way the game is and (89:28 - 89:31)
you play the older game and it&#39;s done (89:29 - 89:33)
and it&#39;s over and that&#39;s the end and (89:31 - 89:37)
that&#39;s fine but in this case it&#39;s like (89:33 - 89:38)
well right now I can play the older game (89:37 - 89:41)
and bring the Pokemon up and then like (89:38 - 89:43)
let&#39;s say in six months I play the older (89:41 - 89:45)
game and I can&#39;t bring the Pokemon up (89:43 - 89:48)
knowing that I could at one point and (89:45 - 89:50)
now I can&#39;t is there something different (89:48 - 89:51)
there to me like it&#39;s going to make me (89:50 - 89:54)
feel a way about it where I won&#39;t I (89:51 - 89:56)
probably won&#39;t want to go back and play (89:54 - 89:58)
the game and I don&#39;t know if that has to (89:56 - 89:59)
do (89:58 - 90:02)
with the way Pokemon games with the (89:59 - 90:04)
story for Pokemon games or something (90:02 - 90:05)
where it&#39;s not maybe that&#39;s not the (90:04 - 90:07)
biggest thing for me and for a lot of (90:05 - 90:10)
people probably with Pokemon games uh so (90:07 - 90:12)
it I don&#39;t need to go and play that (90:10 - 90:14)
older game to experience that in the (90:12 - 90:17)
same way uh but there&#39;s something about (90:14 - 90:19)
it there&#39;s something about knowing that (90:17 - 90:21)
now I can move the Pokemon up but if I (90:19 - 90:23)
play that game in maybe six months or a (90:21 - 90:25)
year from now it&#39;s going to be a (90:23 - 90:26)
different experience you&#39;re going to (90:25 - 90:29)
lose a part (90:26 - 90:32)
of what part of what makes the Pokemon (90:29 - 90:33)
game the Pokemon series the Pokemon (90:32 - 90:36)
series in a way not to say that you&#39;re (90:33 - 90:38)
not to say that your experience is going (90:36 - 90:40)
to be worse or that you you may love (90:38 - 90:41)
those older games where that you can&#39;t (90:40 - 90:43)
even move things up and that&#39;s totally (90:41 - 90:46)
fine but part of the Pokemon series has (90:43 - 90:49)
been being able to move things up and (90:46 - 90:51)
it&#39;s losing that on the older games and (90:49 - 90:53)
so it feels like it&#39;s losing a part of (90:51 - 90:55)
what makes the Pokemon series the (90:53 - 90:57)
Pokemon series and to your point like (90:55 - 91:01)
they eventually have to cut it somewhere (90:57 - 91:02)
because there&#39;s going to be like you (91:01 - 91:03)
said security things that they don&#39;t (91:02 - 91:06)
want to have to go and Patch old stuff (91:03 - 91:07)
especially when Nintendo is not even (91:06 - 91:09)
supporting the online system and things (91:07 - 91:13)
like that but I don&#39;t know like it just (91:09 - 91:16)
feels like it&#39;s losing something it&#39;s (91:13 - 91:18)
it&#39;s losing part of its the essence of (91:16 - 91:20)
it being a Pokemon Series game by not (91:18 - 91:22)
being able to move things (91:20 - 91:25)
up it doesn&#39;t feel like like also if (91:22 - 91:27)
you&#39;re if you&#39;re watching on YouTube (91:25 - 91:29)
feel free to comment like subscribe let (91:27 - 91:31)
me know in the comments if you would (91:29 - 91:34)
play an older Pokemon game if it didn&#39;t (91:31 - 91:36)
have the ability to move a Pokemon up (91:34 - 91:39)
like how important is that to you I (91:36 - 91:40)
would like to read those (91:39 - 91:43)
comments it does seem like now with the (91:40 - 91:47)
switch stuff because Pokemon home is a (91:43 - 91:51)
mobile app that there (91:47 - 91:54)
is like some level of security (91:51 - 91:57)
going forward there mhm whereas like (91:54 - 92:01)
Pokemon Bank was this 3DS only app and (91:57 - 92:04)
we all knew even while playing the 3DS (92:01 - 92:06)
that this is not going to last (92:04 - 92:09)
forever even though they introduced it (92:06 - 92:12)
by saying like two generations down the (92:09 - 92:14)
line you would be able to share (92:12 - 92:17)
Pokemon yeah that you caught then and (92:14 - 92:20)
there right but it&#39;s like the 3DS is not (92:17 - 92:22)
game freak&#39;s product or like the Pokemon (92:20 - 92:24)
company&#39;s product right they they are (92:22 - 92:26)
they&#39;re constrained (92:24 - 92:29)
by the hardware limitations of that (92:26 - 92:34)
device whereas Pokemon home can work on (92:29 - 92:35)
the switch it can work on an Android (92:34 - 92:39)
phone it can work on a Apple phone like (92:35 - 92:41)
that app is theirs and they just need to (92:39 - 92:44)
place that app somewhere they never (92:41 - 92:49)
placed Pokemon Bank anywhere but the (92:44 - 92:52)
3DS where at least with this one it&#39;s on (92:49 - 92:54)
three different platforms Android (92:52 - 92:56)
there&#39;s more variety they could make (92:54 - 92:57)
Apple and Google really mad and get (92:56 - 93:00)
kicked out of the app stores (92:57 - 93:03)
but somehow they&#39;re GNA they&#39;re G to (93:00 - 93:06)
contest like epic and just get (93:03 - 93:08)
banned (93:06 - 93:11)
yeah but there is more variety now that (93:08 - 93:14)
is true it&#39;s in multiple places so (93:11 - 93:16)
there&#39;s more security just in that that (93:14 - 93:19)
that they have more platforms that (93:16 - 93:23)
they&#39;re on so that is good but still I (93:19 - 93:24)
to your point like I still think it (93:23 - 93:28)
would have been great if they introduced (93:24 - 93:30)
these older games if for nothing else (93:28 - 93:33)
just introduced them onto the switch in (93:30 - 93:36)
some way like in some kind of capacity (93:33 - 93:40)
yeah maybe maybe uh (93:36 - 93:43)
future onto modern day systems so that (93:40 - 93:45)
like because (93:43 - 93:47)
people we we&#39;ll see what the comments (93:45 - 93:49)
say but people still love the older (93:47 - 93:51)
games people do love playing the older (93:49 - 93:54)
games and why wouldn&#39;t nintend and the (93:51 - 93:57)
Pokemon company want especially Nintendo (93:54 - 93:59)
want to be like well all these games are (93:57 - 94:01)
here on the switch like come buy a (93:59 - 94:02)
switch you have the 3DS you&#39;re playing (94:01 - 94:04)
these older games here come buy a switch (94:02 - 94:05)
you can play the older games on the (94:04 - 94:07)
switch as (94:05 - 94:09)
well because those games are marioart (94:07 - 94:10)
few (94:09 - 94:13)
times those games are not Mario Kart 8 (94:10 - 94:17)
the only game Nintendo cares (94:13 - 94:17)
about but the the revisits of older (94:17 - 94:23)
games like that ports of older games (94:21 - 94:25)
like that don&#39;t make nearly as much (94:23 - 94:27)
money as new games not to mention the (94:25 - 94:29)
way that the switch has handled pts of (94:27 - 94:31)
old games means that the money probably (94:29 - 94:34)
wouldn&#39;t be going to the Pokemon company (94:31 - 94:37)
as much anyways so there&#39;s there&#39;s a lot (94:34 - 94:39)
of reasons in the systems we have right (94:37 - 94:41)
now that I think are why we are not (94:39 - 94:45)
getting those ports anymore right yeah (94:41 - 94:46)
and I guess it is a different experience (94:45 - 94:50)
when you&#39;re playing those games on the (94:46 - 94:51)
systems that they were originally made (94:50 - 94:53)
for right like there is definitely a (94:51 - 94:57)
difference in like I I take enjoyment in (94:53 - 95:00)
playing a PO older Pokemon game on the (94:57 - 95:04)
3DS or in my case now the 2DS XL but on (95:00 - 95:07)
that like system versus going to the (95:04 - 95:10)
switch where it&#39;s got the OLED screen (95:07 - 95:11)
and everything you&#39;re playing there (95:10 - 95:13)
there&#39;s differences right there there is (95:11 - 95:16)
a a charm and something to playing it on (95:13 - 95:19)
that older system the way that it was (95:16 - 95:21)
played to some extent versus playing it (95:19 - 95:23)
on the brand new system and having it (95:21 - 95:26)
you know but I just I just want them (95:23 - 95:28)
there I what I really want okay this is (95:26 - 95:30)
this is what it comes down to is I just (95:28 - 95:32)
want alola on the switch however they (95:30 - 95:34)
need to do that they make a Pokemon (95:32 - 95:37)
stars they just put it on as a virtual (95:34 - 95:40)
thing some way for me to visit alola on (95:37 - 95:42)
a switch then I will just I don&#39;t care (95:40 - 95:45)
after that that&#39;s just that&#39;s all I want (95:42 - 95:47)
I think the only thing they could have (95:45 - 95:51)
done better or planned out cuz (95:47 - 95:55)
like if anyone knew (95:51 - 95:57)
what was going to H like I think game (95:55 - 96:01)
freak SL any developer knew (95:57 - 96:04)
that Nintendo on the 3DS was Nintendo (96:01 - 96:07)
online on the 3DS was not going to last (96:04 - 96:09)
forever like we&#39;re just not going to (96:07 - 96:10)
support these servers we&#39;re not going to (96:09 - 96:12)
keep up security we&#39;re not going to keep (96:10 - 96:14)
patching loopholes or whatever like (96:12 - 96:16)
everyone every developer knew that this (96:14 - 96:18)
was going to happen it just there is a (96:16 - 96:22)
little like why didn&#39;t they build a (96:18 - 96:24)
different app or (96:22 - 96:27)
update Pokemon bank (96:24 - 96:31)
for better security SL future proofing (96:27 - 96:33)
that when the servers go down because (96:31 - 96:35)
again they did say this isn&#39;t going to (96:33 - 96:38)
last forever like it will last after (96:35 - 96:40)
Pokemon after Nintendo&#39;s server shut (96:38 - 96:43)
down it will still work but maybe you (96:40 - 96:45)
should transfer your Pokemon sooner (96:43 - 96:48)
rather than later so it was a bummer to (96:45 - 96:53)
see there was no like final update to (96:48 - 96:55)
Pokemon Bank to be (96:53 - 96:58)
like we here is the here&#39;s the solution (96:55 - 97:00)
going forward and I don&#39;t know what that (96:58 - 97:02)
would be right like in my head it would (97:00 - 97:05)
be like we&#39;re going to generate you a (97:02 - 97:07)
onetime QR code you&#39;re going to scan it (97:05 - 97:09)
that&#39;s going to move the Pokemon over (97:07 - 97:11)
you don&#39;t need any online it will delete (97:09 - 97:13)
the pokeon like prob probably not a (97:11 - 97:15)
great way to do that like there Pokemon (97:13 - 97:17)
Banks to begin that that&#39;s not how (97:15 - 97:19)
Pokemon Bank Works to begin with because (97:17 - 97:21)
your Pokemon aren&#39;t stored on your 3DS (97:19 - 97:23)
your Pokemon are stored in the servers (97:21 - 97:24)
that they&#39;re going to have have to shut (97:23 - 97:26)
down eventually right right so it&#39;s like (97:24 - 97:28)
I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know what that solution (97:26 - 97:30)
would have been besides like we built (97:28 - 97:32)
this thing 10 years (97:30 - 97:34)
ago and we can&#39;t make it any better and (97:32 - 97:37)
now Pokemon home exists and that&#39;s (97:34 - 97:41)
better and more future proof but this (97:37 - 97:43)
was the best we could do yeah and I (97:41 - 97:45)
think there there are fans that are (97:43 - 97:50)
jaded or upset that like they missed (97:45 - 97:52)
that opportunity to even download (97:50 - 97:55)
Pokemon bank and Pokemon tra transporter (97:52 - 97:57)
and there&#39;s no way to get that well (97:55 - 98:01)
there&#39;s no correct way to get there&#39;s no (97:57 - 98:02)
ethical way I don&#39;t know know how to (98:01 - 98:04)
word that you could still buy yeah you (98:02 - 98:07)
could still secondhand buy a system with (98:04 - 98:09)
it on it that was legitimately (98:07 - 98:11)
downloaded on it and you can (98:09 - 98:14)
but with Pokemon Bank sell being sold on (98:11 - 98:16)
eBay they are selling for more than just (98:14 - 98:19)
your typical 3DS because of the fact (98:16 - 98:21)
that they have Pokemon bank and Pokemon (98:19 - 98:23)
transporter and stuff on them so I (98:21 - 98:28)
bought Wii with my Pokemon Ranch on (98:23 - 98:31)
it I&#39;m going to be completely honest (98:28 - 98:34)
with you I&#39;ve never plugged that Wii in (98:31 - 98:37)
I have no clue if it&#39;s actually (98:34 - 98:42)
on no I bought it like a couple months (98:37 - 98:43)
before I (98:42 - 98:47)
moved to (98:43 - 98:50)
Minneapolis and so like it arrived I was (98:47 - 98:52)
like yeah it looks like everything is (98:50 - 98:54)
here and then I immediately put put it (98:52 - 98:55)
back in the box and then it got packed (98:54 - 98:58)
and it&#39;s somewhere in my house I can&#39;t (98:55 - 99:00)
believe you didn&#39;t you bought a console (98:58 - 99:03)
and didn&#39;t like turn it on like got some (99:00 - 99:05)
just to see that the console (99:03 - 99:09)
Powers I I don&#39;t know I I I trusted the (99:05 - 99:11)
source I bought it from I I like that (99:09 - 99:14)
that wasn&#39;t the worry the I didn&#39;t I (99:11 - 99:15)
wasn&#39;t worried I was going to get like (99:14 - 99:17)
scammed if anything I worry that like (99:15 - 99:20)
just the hardware failed hey I that&#39;s (99:17 - 99:24)
not even like I bought a the first 3D s (99:20 - 99:25)
that I bought I actually bought from a (99:24 - 99:28)
friend it made for this made for a real (99:25 - 99:30)
awkward situation so I bought the 3DS (99:28 - 99:34)
from a friend I and uh they also gave me (99:30 - 99:36)
Pokemon X or something just to just to (99:34 - 99:38)
play like they let me borrow it because (99:36 - 99:40)
I didn&#39;t have any games yet but I was I (99:38 - 99:43)
bought the 3DS from them and I go home (99:40 - 99:48)
and I power on the 3DS and it powers on (99:43 - 99:50)
and then maybe like 15 minutes into (99:48 - 99:52)
playing it it starts acting all weird (99:50 - 99:54)
and so I turned it off and like I turned (99:52 - 99:58)
it wouldn&#39;t turn back on and and then I (99:54 - 99:59)
like you know I read up online at the (99:58 - 100:01)
time cuz I was like what&#39;s going on and (99:59 - 100:03)
then there was that whole like issue (100:01 - 100:04)
with the 3DS having that wire that goes (100:03 - 100:07)
between the screens that would get like (100:04 - 100:08)
stuff would happen with it and it would (100:07 - 100:11)
mess oh I know I remember forgot about (100:08 - 100:14)
that yeah yeah that that issue right so (100:11 - 100:16)
obviously I trusted my friend like it (100:14 - 100:17)
was my friend it wasn&#39;t like some random (100:16 - 100:19)
person and I could go to the person and (100:17 - 100:22)
I did go to the person and was like you (100:19 - 100:24)
it&#39;s broken like I took it home for one (100:22 - 100:26)
day and it&#39;s not working now but like I (100:24 - 100:27)
promised I didn&#39;t do anything to it I (100:26 - 100:31)
just turned it on to play the game and (100:27 - 100:33)
it it was a whole awkward situ I mean (100:31 - 100:34)
we&#39;re still friends and everything but (100:33 - 100:36)
it was like an awkward situation but (100:34 - 100:38)
like I also I also trusted that Source (100:36 - 100:41)
but like these things happen with these (100:38 - 100:43)
systems especially well especially with (100:41 - 100:45)
thatst so so so people are like why did (100:43 - 100:47)
you buy a Wii U with my Pokemon Ranch (100:45 - 100:49)
same thing that happened right like the (100:47 - 100:51)
Wii U stuff shut down there was no way (100:49 - 100:53)
to get my Pokemon Ranch my Pokemon Ranch (100:51 - 100:56)
like Battle Revolution has a couple (100:53 - 100:59)
exclusive Pok√©mon one of those is a Mew (100:56 - 101:02)
mhm now I have like 40 mw&#39;s I have I (100:59 - 101:05)
have the Mew from from Toys R Us I got (101:02 - 101:07)
the Mew from heart gold soul silver (101:05 - 101:09)
maybe that was the Toys R Us one I got (101:07 - 101:11)
the mw&#39;s from Pokeball plus I got the (101:09 - 101:14)
Mew from the scarlet and violet like I (101:11 - 101:18)
got a lot of MW I don&#39;t have a Mew with (101:14 - 101:21)
the OT of Haley yes because that is the (101:18 - 101:23)
that is the camp owner of My Pokemon (101:21 - 101:26)
Ranch the ranch owner and I believe to (101:23 - 101:28)
get the Mew you have to move in a (101:26 - 101:30)
thousand Pokemon into the ranch and then (101:28 - 101:32)
she&#39;s like good job and then she&#39;s like (101:30 - 101:38)
here&#39;s a Mew I think I did that uh so uh (101:32 - 101:40)
if they want me to get that me once they (101:38 - 101:42)
announc that it&#39;s shutting down in a (101:40 - 101:45)
month I got I&#39;ve really got to move you (101:42 - 101:48)
should turn that Wii U on before they (101:45 - 101:50)
announc that they&#39;re shutting down I (101:48 - 101:52)
should start that journey to get Haley&#39;s (101:50 - 101:54)
me I should I think there a couple other (101:52 - 101:56)
Pokemon you get on the way I think (101:54 - 101:59)
there I see a new twitch series starting (101:56 - 102:02)
for you of getting that Pokemon Ranch (101:59 - 102:05)
Mew I would say my Pokemon Ranch is (102:02 - 102:08)
enjoyable but it&#39;s not (102:05 - 102:10)
engaging in the same (102:08 - 102:13)
way yeah it is a (102:10 - 102:17)
uh I really liked it Bute Pokemon (102:13 - 102:20)
