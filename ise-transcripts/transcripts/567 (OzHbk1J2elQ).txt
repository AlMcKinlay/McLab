what's up everyone welcome to the (0:21 - 0:26)
567th episode of the Pokemon podcast (0:24 - 0:29)
it's super effective I'm your host Steve (0:26 - 0:32)
and with me is Hannah (0:29 - 0:34)
oh me first (0:32 - 0:38)
swishes up it's every other it's not I I (0:34 - 0:40)
am here I have not caught any Shadow (0:38 - 0:43)
Mewtwo from raids because I haven't been (0:40 - 0:45)
feeling super great this week but I'm (0:43 - 0:47)
starting to feel better (0:45 - 0:48)
Team Rocket got to you (0:47 - 0:52)
possibly or allergies one or the other (0:48 - 0:55)
well allergies are a team rocket plot to (0:52 - 0:57)
stop people from going outside they're (0:55 - 0:59)
the ones that planted the trees that (0:57 - 1:01)
don't give fruit absolutely that that is (0:59 - 1:03)
city that is the height of City Planning (1:01 - 1:06)
and we all know that sitting planning is (1:03 - 1:09)
a corporate based Shenanigans and what (1:06 - 1:11)
was one of Giovanni's big things taking (1:09 - 1:15)
over corporations it's all tied together (1:11 - 1:17)
find out next week if I've convinced (1:15 - 1:19)
Greg to go get Shadow Mewtwo after this (1:17 - 1:21)
episode no (1:19 - 1:23)
no (1:21 - 1:23)
um Greg's here I'm here I saw a where (1:26 - 1:32)
was I I was because now that it's nice (1:29 - 1:34)
outside again I'm doing my daily incense (1:32 - 1:35)
because I'm actually walking outside (1:34 - 1:37)
again because I can instead of being (1:35 - 1:42)
like I'm gonna die out here uh and I saw (1:37 - 1:45)
a shadow (1:42 - 1:45)
gym raid thing and I'm like oh I wonder (1:45 - 1:52)
what that is and so I walked close (1:48 - 1:53)
enough to see that it was a shadow (1:52 - 1:56)
buildup and I'm like hard pass I don't (1:53 - 1:58)
know (1:56 - 1:58)
I I hey I have shiny (1:59 - 2:05)
a lot of them all of them all of them (2:02 - 2:08)
are shouting I got I got good ones two (2:05 - 2:10)
there's nothing people are like oh then (2:08 - 2:12)
it's great because you leave it Shadow (2:10 - 2:14)
and no you don't leave it Shadow because (2:12 - 2:16)
that is torturing the Pokemon again you (2:14 - 2:18)
have to purify your Pokemon because (2:16 - 2:21)
Pokemon are your friends are you also (2:18 - 2:23)
against Mega Evolution then (2:21 - 2:27)
I mean I'm not overly fond of it it's a (2:23 - 2:29)
it's a advice (2:27 - 2:29)
Mega Evolution is actually at multiple (2:30 - 2:37)
points for saying that it is your strong (2:34 - 2:39)
friend bond that allows Mega Evolution (2:37 - 2:42)
to happen yes because if you don't have (2:39 - 2:43)
a strong bond then it's just painful and (2:42 - 2:46)
terrifying for them experience oh you (2:43 - 2:48)
better believe I have a strong ground (2:46 - 2:52)
so I naturally only have strong bonds (2:48 - 2:54)
with all of my Pokemon as though this (2:52 - 2:56)
hey just Mega something because it's (2:54 - 2:59)
good for Community Steve I have a lot of (2:56 - 3:01)
thought into how I treat my Pokemon hey (2:59 - 3:05)
I make it I I make it every day (3:01 - 3:05)
they need to get to three hearts (3:07 - 3:11)
eventually Greg (3:08 - 3:11)
Crush those bones over and over until (3:12 - 3:16)
they get to three hearts (3:14 - 3:20)
um well we got uh not a terrible amount (3:16 - 3:22)
of news there was news but it's like (3:20 - 3:23)
news that there's (3:22 - 3:25)
that yeah there's really nothing to talk (3:23 - 3:29)
about yeah these things happen weird (3:25 - 3:31)
we're in a weird sort of lull of things (3:29 - 3:34)
especially since they clearly broke (3:31 - 3:35)
raids Beyond repair and they're never (3:34 - 3:37)
coming back (3:35 - 3:39)
uh yeah well there's there's raids and (3:37 - 3:42)
Scarlet and violet that are still broken (3:39 - 3:43)
um but I guess since we've already (3:42 - 3:45)
mentioned Shadow Mewtwo let's start off (3:43 - 3:49)
with the Pokemon Go stuff which is the (3:45 - 3:51)
shadow Mewtwo stuff uh sounds like I was (3:49 - 3:53)
the only person that did Shadow Mewtwo (3:51 - 3:55)
um which is okay (3:53 - 3:58)
Greg has an opportunity in two hours (3:55 - 4:01)
after the show (3:58 - 4:01)
I have a lot of thoughts on Shadow me (4:07 - 4:11)
too good and bad (4:09 - 4:12)
um Shadow me too according to (4:11 - 4:16)
pokemon.com was uh (4:12 - 4:19)
this weekend although I think there was (4:16 - 4:23)
like a Minor error on pokemon.com the (4:19 - 4:25)
something with that purified gems I (4:23 - 4:27)
didn't here's the thing sometimes when (4:25 - 4:30)
you read pokemon.com or Pokemon (4:27 - 4:33)
goalive.com and they try to explain a (4:30 - 4:36)
mechanic (4:33 - 4:36)
not very good they're very bad at (4:36 - 4:41)
explaining it you can tell that they (4:38 - 4:43)
don't know they're not good at sort of (4:41 - 4:45)
teaching people and a lot of these (4:43 - 4:48)
articles like they don't have the adult (4:45 - 4:51)
education background necessary (4:48 - 4:54)
Pokemon go that's the main way they're (4:51 - 4:57)
telling people how this works (4:54 - 4:59)
like I feel like the person who wrote (4:57 - 5:02)
so I maybe Pokemon gets a pass because (4:59 - 5:04)
they're not Niantic so they were (5:02 - 5:08)
probably like faxed to the the bullet (5:04 - 5:10)
points (5:08 - 5:12)
but I feel like I go back and I read the (5:10 - 5:14)
Niantic article and I'm like I feel like (5:12 - 5:15)
the person who wrote this didn't (5:14 - 5:17)
actually play test it either I think (5:15 - 5:19)
they just also got the bullet points (5:17 - 5:21)
yeah somebody must have played tested it (5:19 - 5:22)
uh here's the thing (5:21 - 5:26)
I think the Mewtwo raids were really (5:22 - 5:27)
cool (5:26 - 5:29)
I think the like (5:27 - 5:32)
so I I did three (5:29 - 5:34)
okay hold on I said a good thing about (5:32 - 5:36)
Niantic I think they're cool let me talk (5:34 - 5:37)
about all the bad things first number (5:36 - 5:39)
one (5:37 - 5:43)
I don't personally have a problem with (5:39 - 5:45)
raids that don't allow remote right (5:43 - 5:49)
passes but (5:45 - 5:49)
it works for elite raids because they (5:50 - 5:56)
have time (5:54 - 5:59)
stamps I I go at 11 I go at two I go at (5:56 - 6:00)
five (5:59 - 6:03)
the majority of my day yesterday was (6:00 - 6:07)
continuing to check camp fire and then (6:03 - 6:10)
weighing the possibility of if it was (6:07 - 6:13)
worth driving 15 minutes (6:10 - 6:15)
it was like (6:13 - 6:17)
um okay well this one starts in 20 it'll (6:15 - 6:20)
take me 15 to get there but if there's (6:17 - 6:21)
traffic I'm gonna be late and if I'm (6:20 - 6:23)
late I'm gonna miss the first group but (6:21 - 6:25)
also I've never been to this park before (6:23 - 6:26)
so I don't know so I would like check (6:25 - 6:29)
like Centennial likes because I know a (6:26 - 6:30)
lot of people play go there obviously (6:29 - 6:33)
Mall of America because (6:30 - 6:34)
the (6:33 - 6:36)
it's mall America (6:34 - 6:37)
um (6:36 - 6:41)
and most of the day I was like I don't (6:37 - 6:44)
think it's worth going because I have no (6:41 - 6:49)
clue who's showing up (6:44 - 6:51)
and then finally set up fireworks and be (6:49 - 6:53)
like hey you can only once you're in a (6:51 - 6:56)
certain you have to be close to it (6:53 - 7:00)
I wish you could say like I'm interested (6:56 - 7:02)
I wish there was two different fireworks (7:00 - 7:04)
like I'm in I'm I'm looking (7:02 - 7:07)
I'm like maybe like a watch list on eBay (7:04 - 7:09)
like hey there's like five people (7:07 - 7:13)
watching this raid I think you can join (7:09 - 7:15)
the chat for a raid on campfire without (7:13 - 7:18)
being nearby (7:15 - 7:24)
who is doing that nobody is like I'm in (7:18 - 7:27)
campfire chat that you would take (7:24 - 7:29)
seriously (7:27 - 7:32)
I mean like yes Hannah is right you (7:29 - 7:35)
could use campfire (7:32 - 7:35)
this this will lead on to my my second (7:35 - 7:41)
story but like (7:38 - 7:41)
it's so frustrating even in a big city (7:42 - 7:50)
to to to have this dilemma of (7:45 - 7:50)
I want to play Pokemon go but I don't (7:50 - 7:55)
want it to be my entire Saturday (7:52 - 7:59)
like if I'm going to (7:55 - 8:02)
okay another Side Story when Greg it was (7:59 - 8:04)
it was me Greg will and Brooke and we (8:02 - 8:06)
were doing community day (8:04 - 8:09)
and I've never heard anyone say this (8:06 - 8:12)
before but it was a great point we did a (8:09 - 8:13)
raid together I don't know it was a (8:12 - 8:15)
tapufini right the four of us did (8:13 - 8:17)
tapufini and then we walked around the (8:15 - 8:20)
park and then we got to a pincer or a (8:17 - 8:22)
mega pincer right it was Mega pincer and (8:20 - 8:24)
then we all went to jump in and then (8:22 - 8:26)
Brooke was like (8:24 - 8:29)
oh I have to pay a dollar (8:26 - 8:32)
and I was like yeah (8:29 - 8:35)
and they were like but I'm here in (8:32 - 8:36)
person yeah (8:35 - 8:39)
pay a dollar and I was like that's kind (8:36 - 8:42)
of a good one yeah (8:39 - 8:45)
because we're so used to remote raid (8:42 - 8:49)
passes and I think the three of us have (8:45 - 8:51)
a huge stack of in-person passes that we (8:49 - 8:53)
just never run into yeah I think I have (8:51 - 8:56)
like 79 left it's unreal I like I will (8:53 - 8:58)
do I will do bellsprouts because the the (8:56 - 9:01)
bag storage is more important than the (8:58 - 9:04)
raid passes at this point I mean I have (9:01 - 9:05)
a bunch of them and you get them but it (9:04 - 9:08)
is also one of those things like I still (9:05 - 9:10)
feel like they've never really figured (9:08 - 9:12)
out how to do raids (9:10 - 9:15)
on Community Day well (9:12 - 9:19)
like they should just make (9:15 - 9:21)
great you should get just in general get (9:19 - 9:24)
more free raid passes on community day (9:21 - 9:27)
especially since you've chunked it down (9:24 - 9:31)
to this set window on a set day and you (9:27 - 9:33)
want people out there (9:31 - 9:36)
and you want people to be going out and (9:33 - 9:37)
doing these things and getting together (9:36 - 9:40)
and you still really aren't rewarding (9:37 - 9:42)
that very well (9:40 - 9:45)
um and you have this huge opportunity to (9:42 - 9:47)
give people access to like this is what (9:45 - 9:49)
raids are like and this is how raids (9:47 - 9:51)
work and this is a time when you're (9:49 - 9:52)
going to have the best experience (9:51 - 9:54)
because there's a lot of people around (9:52 - 9:57)
you doing raids and you'll still only (9:54 - 9:59)
get one (9:57 - 10:00)
for free (9:59 - 10:02)
that day (10:00 - 10:04)
I kind of I don't think that's a good (10:02 - 10:06)
point too like you know how it's like (10:04 - 10:09)
one extra lucky trade or like half (10:06 - 10:12)
Stardust or why isn't it like two extra (10:09 - 10:15)
raid pass like yeah in-person raid (10:12 - 10:17)
passes like that would be (10:15 - 10:20)
that's what red days are for (10:17 - 10:22)
eign (10:20 - 10:22)
key there were 40 plus people to both (10:38 - 10:45)
and the the (10:42 - 10:48)
I I used Discord the first time just to (10:45 - 10:52)
like pinpoint where I need to go (10:48 - 10:52)
it was like okay people people are (10:54 - 10:57)
showing up (10:56 - 10:59)
I (10:57 - 11:02)
I don't know I I unless you're already (10:59 - 11:03)
in (11:02 - 11:06)
a community (11:03 - 11:06)
if you really wanted me to one you (11:07 - 11:11)
probably had to live in a pretty big (11:10 - 11:14)
city or (11:11 - 11:14)
it just it what a hassle it's just like (11:14 - 11:19)
it's not it's not like the worst thing (11:17 - 11:22)
in the world it's just a hassle it's (11:19 - 11:26)
just like weighing between do I want to (11:22 - 11:28)
go out and be disappointed that either (11:26 - 11:32)
no one showed up or not enough people or (11:28 - 11:35)
I drove all this time for one raid like (11:32 - 11:37)
like if I went to if I went to mall (11:35 - 11:39)
America and they were like five raids (11:37 - 11:41)
guaranteed I'd be like done easy because (11:39 - 11:42)
that's what like a raid day is well (11:41 - 11:43)
right well technically there's like (11:42 - 11:44)
eight (11:43 - 11:47)
gyms at Mall of America (11:44 - 11:50)
but I don't I've to me it's like there's (11:47 - 11:51)
no way niantic's vision is like we want (11:50 - 11:54)
our players to drive 15 minutes to get (11:51 - 11:56)
out of their car to do one raid to then (11:54 - 11:58)
drive 15 minutes to go home because (11:56 - 11:59)
there's nothing else to do after the (11:58 - 12:03)
raid like yeah there is still like (11:59 - 12:05)
Niantic lives in some fantasy world (12:03 - 12:09)
sometimes well my local community and (12:05 - 12:11)
for the record I do very much appreciate (12:09 - 12:14)
my local Discord Community uh seems like (12:11 - 12:15)
they were able to get together pretty (12:14 - 12:16)
well (12:15 - 12:19)
um they it's not as active a community (12:16 - 12:20)
as it used to be but it does seem like (12:19 - 12:22)
people were able to organize and get (12:20 - 12:24)
together for a good number of raids (12:22 - 12:26)
yesterday and maybe today too though I (12:24 - 12:27)
haven't checked (12:26 - 12:30)
it's just you have to be in a community (12:27 - 12:32)
like that because Discord is still way (12:30 - 12:34)
better at organizing that and having a (12:32 - 12:36)
set community is still way better at (12:34 - 12:38)
organizing that than trying to go (12:36 - 12:40)
through campfire or trying to go through (12:38 - 12:42)
a community that you don't know (12:40 - 12:44)
but even with like raid days at least if (12:42 - 12:46)
I know I'm gonna go somewhere I might (12:44 - 12:48)
miss like one or two but then I can (12:46 - 12:50)
follow the group and I can keep going (12:48 - 12:52)
yeah I mean with great days every single (12:50 - 12:55)
gym yeah with Mewtwo it was like (12:52 - 12:58)
I woke up and like I checked Mall of (12:55 - 13:01)
America right away which is now that I'm (12:58 - 13:02)
thinking about my day yesterday I was (13:01 - 13:03)
like I can't believe the first thing I (13:02 - 13:07)
did was check campfire when I woke (13:03 - 13:09)
but like I woke up I checked I checked (13:07 - 13:11)
campfire and it was like Mewtwo in 20 (13:09 - 13:13)
minutes at mall America and I was like I (13:11 - 13:15)
mean I can get there in 15 if I throw (13:13 - 13:18)
some pants on and go but like (13:15 - 13:20)
now I'm at ball of like once I'm done (13:18 - 13:23)
I'm just gonna drive back home and like (13:20 - 13:26)
am I gonna drive back out again to do me (13:23 - 13:28)
it's (13:26 - 13:31)
like the random sprinkles of Mewtwo in (13:28 - 13:34)
the city is not a PR like I I saw on (13:31 - 13:36)
Twitter that you know people had raid (13:34 - 13:38)
trains and stuff and that's really cool (13:36 - 13:40)
but like (13:38 - 13:40)
yeah (13:40 - 13:43)
with the spawns yeah like you must have (13:40 - 13:44)
had like (13:43 - 13:46)
you must have been in a very densely (13:44 - 13:49)
populated area to (13:46 - 13:52)
to keep like moving in between or did a (13:49 - 13:54)
lot of walking or there was like (13:52 - 13:56)
well I remember when Ray Rayquaza first (13:54 - 13:59)
came out in Pokemon go like six years (13:56 - 14:01)
ago I remember like people would (13:59 - 14:04)
40 people would get out of their car (14:01 - 14:06)
I'll do it get in their car and then (14:04 - 14:08)
follow each other and that was a (14:06 - 14:09)
nightmare as well I didn't want to like (14:08 - 14:12)
Drive behind another 40 cars and then (14:09 - 14:13)
try to figure out parking to get into a (14:12 - 14:16)
Rayquaza I did it (14:13 - 14:20)
experience I will always cherish (14:16 - 14:20)
so besides like the (14:21 - 14:28)
hassle of getting into a Mewtwo (14:24 - 14:32)
so finally I I was like at dinner ate (14:28 - 14:33)
dinner checked Mall of America (14:32 - 14:35)
there was a Mewtwo in 20 minutes and (14:33 - 14:37)
there was a Mewtwo in 30 minutes at Mall (14:35 - 14:40)
of America and I was like okay (14:37 - 14:41)
we're going over that way anyways (14:40 - 14:44)
because there's a Target over there (14:41 - 14:46)
and I was like okay we were gonna go to (14:44 - 14:47)
Target anyways we'll hit up mall America (14:46 - 14:49)
first I don't know if we'll make the 20 (14:47 - 14:51)
minute one but at least we know this (14:49 - 14:53)
again this is like the logic of Pokemon (14:51 - 14:56)
go at least we know the people that will (14:53 - 14:58)
be at the 20 minute one will then (14:56 - 15:02)
migrate to the 30 minute one so like (14:58 - 15:05)
at least those people will stick around (15:02 - 15:09)
for the next Mewtwo unless they run out (15:05 - 15:10)
of raid passes and have to pay the buck (15:09 - 15:15)
that's just that's true so I I get there (15:10 - 15:19)
and I'm like hustling (15:15 - 15:21)
because like you can you can now see how (15:19 - 15:23)
many people are like in it (15:21 - 15:26)
like they have a little like character (15:23 - 15:27)
account and I saw like three little (15:26 - 15:30)
figures and then I jumped up to five (15:27 - 15:32)
and I'm like trying to hustle and of (15:30 - 15:34)
course my GPS isn't updating because (15:32 - 15:35)
we're in like the parking structure of (15:34 - 15:36)
Mall of America (15:35 - 15:40)
and there's like 18 people there's two (15:36 - 15:42)
of us there's like 10 seconds left still (15:40 - 15:43)
not close enough and then the raid (15:42 - 15:48)
closes and we miss it which is (15:43 - 15:50)
pre-covered that is that is the (15:48 - 15:54)
experience that that that is the true (15:50 - 15:57)
Niantic experience now you could be one (15:54 - 16:00)
of two people you can be the person that (15:57 - 16:02)
tries to figure out where the group is (16:00 - 16:05)
ask them to back out which no they're (16:02 - 16:07)
not going to they're not going to (16:05 - 16:09)
or you can be the person that's like (16:07 - 16:12)
well I just wasted I've wasted all this (16:09 - 16:14)
time (16:12 - 16:15)
um so I was like you know what I'll jump (16:14 - 16:16)
in (16:15 - 16:19)
uh we'll see if any other people jump in (16:16 - 16:22)
and lo and behold (16:19 - 16:25)
we got up to 12 people (16:22 - 16:27)
and now I'm thinking oh this is bad (16:25 - 16:30)
because now we're in this raid the other (16:27 - 16:32)
rate of 20 just started they're gonna (16:30 - 16:34)
move on to the new Mewtwo and then we're (16:32 - 16:37)
gonna get behind because we're now (16:34 - 16:39)
behind and it's gonna take you longer (16:37 - 16:41)
because you have less people correct (16:39 - 16:44)
100. (16:41 - 16:44)
so I we we're doing the me too 12 people (16:46 - 16:51)
and it's feeling really good (16:49 - 16:54)
right it says it says like Mewtwo (16:51 - 16:57)
enraged and everything's working well (16:54 - 17:00)
and then the purified gems which is like (16:57 - 17:02)
the start of this raid I'm like where (17:00 - 17:03)
this where are the purified gems like (17:02 - 17:07)
how am I supposed to like subdue it uh (17:03 - 17:10)
the mechanic is cool enough where it (17:07 - 17:12)
only pops up when you need to use it and (17:10 - 17:14)
then when it's like when Mewtwo is like (17:12 - 17:15)
chilled out (17:14 - 17:18)
uh it goes away so you can't so you're (17:15 - 17:19)
not wasting your purified gems which is (17:18 - 17:21)
really great (17:19 - 17:23)
um so it popped up I have three purify (17:21 - 17:28)
gems I use one Mewtwo has like the down (17:23 - 17:29)
arrows or whatever of like you're (17:28 - 17:31)
calming them down (17:29 - 17:34)
he's calmed down for a bit we're doing (17:31 - 17:34)
it (17:34 - 17:36)
and (17:34 - 17:38)
in like 30 seconds he's at like 50 (17:36 - 17:40)
health I was like oh this is way easier (17:38 - 17:43)
than people are saying and then we got (17:40 - 17:46)
to like the 40 and he like gets really (17:43 - 17:48)
mad again he gets enraged again (17:46 - 17:51)
and I'm like well I already used a gem (17:48 - 17:54)
I'm not gonna use another gem because (17:51 - 17:56)
the gem thing that works (17:54 - 17:58)
and I was like other people can use gems (17:56 - 18:02)
right no one uses a gem so in the like (17:58 - 18:07)
40 to 25 Health we lose over like a (18:02 - 18:09)
hundred seconds it's possible people (18:07 - 18:11)
were using gems but you have to use (18:09 - 18:14)
eight for them to do anything oh okay (18:11 - 18:16)
well we didn't have eight yeah we (18:14 - 18:19)
definitely did not have eight maybe the (18:16 - 18:21)
first round it felt like every somebody (18:19 - 18:23)
people were using it we lost so much (18:21 - 18:26)
time that I got to the point where we (18:23 - 18:28)
had like 30 seconds left (18:26 - 18:31)
and he had like 25 HP which I think at (18:28 - 18:33)
25 he's no longer enraged anymore like (18:31 - 18:35)
the last 25 percent I think they're (18:33 - 18:37)
they're good to go and we were able to (18:35 - 18:40)
do it but just barely and I was like (18:37 - 18:42)
this is like I'm I'm like in my head I'm (18:40 - 18:45)
like screaming like why is no one using (18:42 - 18:47)
their gems but I do think it's like a (18:45 - 18:49)
cool I think it's really cool I think (18:47 - 18:51)
it's like a (18:49 - 18:54)
it makes raids more interesting to the (18:51 - 18:57)
point of like I had to pay attention to (18:54 - 18:59)
it and I think that's a good thing do I (18:57 - 19:00)
think it's like perfect (18:59 - 19:03)
no because it relies on other people but (19:00 - 19:05)
like welcome to like Pokemon unite and (19:03 - 19:08)
to like seven star rates and search like (19:05 - 19:09)
if you know how it works you know that (19:08 - 19:12)
it has to rely on other people that I'm (19:09 - 19:13)
pretty sure and like I said I've been (19:12 - 19:14)
feeling bad this week so I haven't (19:13 - 19:17)
actually gone out to test it I'm pretty (19:14 - 19:20)
sure you can do five purified gems per (19:17 - 19:23)
user in the raid per person but you have (19:20 - 19:25)
to have eight for it to actually do (19:23 - 19:27)
anything so you have to have at least (19:25 - 19:29)
two people using all of their purified (19:27 - 19:32)
jumps or one peop one person using all (19:29 - 19:34)
of them and one person using three you (19:32 - 19:35)
have to get to that eight Mark for them (19:34 - 19:38)
to actually work (19:35 - 19:40)
so it's not something you can do solo (19:38 - 19:43)
it's so simple and clear (19:40 - 19:44)
yeah I mean and they tell you about this (19:43 - 19:47)
obviously obviously they spell it out (19:44 - 19:50)
they're clear instructions uh there's a (19:47 - 19:53)
couple of videos I'm sure they did some (19:50 - 19:55)
Ticky talks about it so that you can all (19:53 - 19:58)
quickly get to speed no what no that's (19:55 - 20:00)
not okay thanks (19:58 - 20:00)
um (20:00 - 20:04)
so it was it was uh I'm glad we almost (20:00 - 20:05)
failed it because (20:04 - 20:07)
I think it's sometimes in like seven (20:05 - 20:09)
star raids in scarlet and violet where (20:07 - 20:10)
people walk away and they're like man (20:09 - 20:12)
that was like the easiest Italian was so (20:10 - 20:15)
easy your type lotion was so easy (20:12 - 20:15)
yes but it was because everyone knew (20:15 - 20:20)
what they were doing like when I'm in (20:18 - 20:22)
when I was in a Typhlosion raid when I (20:20 - 20:23)
was playing with Nintendo and everyone (20:22 - 20:25)
had bad counters and I'm like trying to (20:23 - 20:27)
watch like I was like now I realize why (20:25 - 20:30)
this rate is hard because (20:27 - 20:33)
no one has good things and when I was (20:30 - 20:35)
doing it with like my twitch chat like (20:33 - 20:37)
everyone had such good counters that it (20:35 - 20:40)
felt buttery smooth right like it felt (20:37 - 20:41)
really good (20:40 - 20:44)
so I'm kind of glad that raid was a bit (20:41 - 20:46)
of a disaster because then I I had to (20:44 - 20:47)
pay attention to the mechanics and how (20:46 - 20:50)
it was working and and (20:47 - 20:52)
the next ride we did (20:50 - 20:55)
uh we had 20 people (20:52 - 20:56)
um and I didn't use any purified gems (20:55 - 21:00)
because everyone else was like so fast (20:56 - 21:02)
at it like like the button popped up to (21:00 - 21:05)
use it and I was like oh like oh I'll (21:02 - 21:07)
wait a second or two and I did and then (21:05 - 21:08)
all of a sudden the button went away (21:07 - 21:10)
because like me too was subdued so it (21:08 - 21:12)
was like really cool like the the second (21:10 - 21:15)
time didn't really feel (21:12 - 21:18)
it felt kind of like a normal T5 raid (21:15 - 21:20)
because everyone because they're out of (21:18 - 21:22)
the 20 people somebody was throwing gems (21:20 - 21:24)
at it and I also didn't know you get (21:22 - 21:26)
like more purified gems when you beat me (21:24 - 21:28)
too so that's cool too (21:26 - 21:30)
um (21:28 - 21:33)
but you can only hold 10. so you should (21:30 - 21:34)
be using them (21:33 - 21:36)
oh yeah I think I think I have like five (21:34 - 21:38)
or six now I started the day with three (21:36 - 21:40)
and I used a bunch but I'm still at like (21:38 - 21:41)
a positive (21:40 - 21:44)
so then we finished that raid and then (21:41 - 21:46)
another Mewtwo Pops in 45 minutes and (21:44 - 21:48)
I'm like well (21:46 - 21:52)
we're at Mall of America so do we leave (21:48 - 21:54)
or do we just wait out the 45 minutes (21:52 - 21:57)
again niantic's perfect vision of (21:54 - 22:01)
walking circles trainer (21:57 - 22:03)
five minutes (22:01 - 22:05)
like that (22:03 - 22:05)
timer is 45 minutes right so while we (22:05 - 22:09)
were in that raid that egg (22:07 - 22:14)
started yeah like that's no no I'm not (22:09 - 22:17)
waiting around 45 minutes (22:14 - 22:20)
you (22:17 - 22:20)
you really could just make the timer (22:22 - 22:27)
that they are around for longer rather (22:24 - 22:30)
than just have the egg timer (22:27 - 22:30)
I'll have the Mewtwo be up longer yeah (22:31 - 22:35)
you can't spend 45 minutes in an Apple (22:35 - 22:41)
Store no I didn't but I we I went to (22:38 - 22:44)
Panera I got my sip Club I went to Apple (22:41 - 22:47)
[Laughter] (22:44 - 22:49)
tent of the 45 minutes is for people for (22:47 - 22:52)
it to give people long enough to (22:49 - 22:55)
organize yeah to plan to go to that (22:52 - 22:58)
and so that it prevents people from (22:55 - 23:00)
going to it before then (22:58 - 23:06)
yeah so so the the the the final story (23:00 - 23:09)
is I no one was using campfire for this (23:06 - 23:11)
third Mewtwo (23:09 - 23:13)
nothing popped up (23:11 - 23:17)
we've I've I'm sitting down waiting the (23:13 - 23:19)
last five minutes for it to pop I can (23:17 - 23:21)
see that other Pokemon go players are (23:19 - 23:22)
gathering (23:21 - 23:24)
and (23:22 - 23:25)
I go to (23:24 - 23:29)
I go to jump in the first one because it (23:25 - 23:31)
says 18 like as soon as it popped it (23:29 - 23:34)
said like 18 people that one failed (23:31 - 23:37)
so one whole raid of 20 people fill I go (23:34 - 23:39)
into the second one (23:37 - 23:42)
mine fills and then the the person I'm (23:39 - 23:44)
with there in a third one and that one (23:42 - 23:48)
fills so no one is using campfire I just (23:44 - 23:50)
want to stress this (23:48 - 23:50)
over 6 60 people joined this Mewtwo raid (23:51 - 23:58)
it's and again privileged to be at Mall (23:55 - 24:00)
of America I you know to be fair I've (23:58 - 24:01)
been at Mall of America with t5s that (24:00 - 24:03)
don't fill up (24:01 - 24:04)
but (24:03 - 24:06)
people love me too (24:04 - 24:08)
but that that that's what was impressive (24:06 - 24:11)
to me is that (24:08 - 24:15)
for as difficult as it was to even get (24:11 - 24:17)
to this point of finding three metoo (24:15 - 24:20)
raids that (24:17 - 24:21)
people are out there and they're they're (24:20 - 24:24)
doing it the other like side note is in (24:21 - 24:27)
all three of my raids that I did and (24:24 - 24:28)
again I don't know if this is because (24:27 - 24:30)
like Mewtwo brings out (24:28 - 24:33)
just Mewtwo's a very popular Pokemon (24:30 - 24:35)
obviously (24:33 - 24:37)
it's also the strongest Pokemon in (24:35 - 24:40)
Pokemon go and it's a shadow (24:37 - 24:40)
um (24:40 - 24:44)
out of the three raids I did (24:41 - 24:47)
I would say (24:44 - 24:47)
only two people in each raid were over (24:47 - 24:52)
level 40. (24:50 - 24:54)
I was like counting and I was like this (24:52 - 24:57)
is insane to me that out of like 20 (24:54 - 24:59)
people in this raid 20 people in this (24:57 - 25:00)
raid (24:59 - 25:04)
that me and one other person are above (25:00 - 25:09)
level 40 and like 27 29 34 30 and the (25:04 - 25:10)
only reason I paid attention to that is (25:09 - 25:12)
because the first time I was like okay (25:10 - 25:14)
we have 12 people and then I was like oh (25:12 - 25:17)
you're you're 19. you're 23. you're (25:14 - 25:18)
through I was like I don't think we're (25:17 - 25:20)
gonna be able to do this with 12 people (25:18 - 25:23)
like cheese your levels are so low we (25:20 - 25:24)
did it (25:23 - 25:26)
but that was kind of wild to me just (25:24 - 25:28)
like paying attention to levels and (25:26 - 25:30)
being like (25:28 - 25:33)
I don't know when when you're in (25:30 - 25:36)
hardcore Pokemon communities you just (25:33 - 25:37)
kind of take for granted everyone's been (25:36 - 25:39)
playing this game every day since day (25:37 - 25:42)
one and everyone's you know level 50 and (25:39 - 25:45)
everyone has good counters and it's (25:42 - 25:49)
it's just not the case (25:45 - 25:49)
uh (25:50 - 25:54)
uh that's of my good and bad of me too I (25:52 - 25:56)
I liked the meeting I wanted to do more (25:54 - 25:58)
me too's I wish it was easier to do more (25:56 - 26:00)
meetings I would be willing to give (25:58 - 26:03)
Niantic money to do more ebts but (26:00 - 26:06)
if it had been more of an actual raid (26:03 - 26:08)
day it sounds like it would have been (26:06 - 26:10)
improved (26:08 - 26:13)
yeah I don't know why (26:10 - 26:13)
I had I don't know I don't know why it's (26:14 - 26:19)
like we'll randomly sprinkle them (26:17 - 26:20)
throughout the day why don't you just (26:19 - 26:22)
make them appear like hey a bunch of (26:20 - 26:23)
mewtwos are at 11 a bunch of metis are (26:22 - 26:25)
at two a bunch of meets these are at (26:23 - 26:27)
five it's what's the problem (26:25 - 26:29)
[Laughter] (26:27 - 26:31)
they want to take your entire day (26:29 - 26:34)
we know this (26:31 - 26:37)
gotta give them my mind (26:34 - 26:39)
you're talking now we're on the same (26:37 - 26:39)
page (26:39 - 26:42)
[Laughter] (26:39 - 26:45)
I know that like the joke is like (26:42 - 26:49)
Niantic hates money they could have had (26:45 - 26:51)
as a limited money with remote raid (26:49 - 26:54)
passes they limited remote raid passes (26:51 - 26:56)
their reasoning is they want people to (26:54 - 26:57)
go outside because that's their vision (26:56 - 27:00)
of the game I get it I respect it to a (26:57 - 27:02)
degree (27:00 - 27:02)
I will I am willing to drive to Mall of (27:03 - 27:09)
America or wherever and do 10 raids (27:06 - 27:12)
you're only giving me one (27:09 - 27:13)
make them all (27:12 - 27:15)
I'll do it (27:13 - 27:17)
I are the ideal Customer because I am (27:15 - 27:19)
not willing to drive to Mall of America (27:17 - 27:22)
to do one but it's like it's like a (27:19 - 27:24)
balance of like if you are going to make (27:22 - 27:27)
me play this game I want (27:24 - 27:30)
I don't want my experience to be like (27:27 - 27:33)
driving from raid to raid (27:30 - 27:35)
you want the experience to be doing the (27:33 - 27:38)
raids yeah like it like the great thing (27:35 - 27:40)
about Community Day is when we go to (27:38 - 27:41)
Mall of where we go to a park or we go (27:40 - 27:43)
to Mall of America where like we know (27:41 - 27:45)
that that three hours we're going to get (27:43 - 27:47)
the full experience (27:45 - 27:49)
and like even with a radar like okay (27:47 - 27:52)
we'll go to this park every every gym (27:49 - 27:55)
will be bravery and we'll just keep (27:52 - 27:57)
doing bravery and in between we can (27:55 - 28:00)
catch coughing (27:57 - 28:04)
um like that's an experience my (28:00 - 28:07)
experience of like frequently checking (28:04 - 28:10)
campfire every 20 minutes and then (28:07 - 28:12)
weighing in my head if it's worth (28:10 - 28:14)
thriving out there it's not the (28:12 - 28:18)
experience I want (28:14 - 28:18)
and I'm using your app now I think (28:19 - 28:24)
obviously campfire (28:21 - 28:24)
Camp first still has a lot of issues (28:25 - 28:31)
it's there it exists it helps in some (28:28 - 28:35)
cases it's better than nothing maybe I (28:31 - 28:37)
think saying it's there is probably the (28:35 - 28:40)
best review you can get (28:37 - 28:42)
I think it's better than nothing I think (28:40 - 28:44)
that we can solidly say it's better than (28:42 - 28:46)
nothing it (28:44 - 28:50)
I've never gotten it to work so (28:46 - 28:53)
I'm not gonna sign off on that but to be (28:50 - 28:56)
fair after the first few times when I'm (28:53 - 28:58)
like this just doesn't do anything I (28:56 - 29:00)
stopped (28:58 - 29:02)
to be able to check (29:00 - 29:06)
Mall of America or certain Parks I like (29:02 - 29:09)
is is alone in itself a great feature (29:06 - 29:12)
yeah and being able to check the gyms (29:09 - 29:14)
check which rates are where is what I (29:12 - 29:16)
use it for (29:14 - 29:19)
it's not the chat feature (29:16 - 29:20)
it doesn't like the chat like (29:19 - 29:22)
self-destruct after like five minutes (29:20 - 29:25)
after the raid closes too (29:22 - 29:25)
which probably for the best honestly (29:26 - 29:29)
that creates a whole nother set of (29:32 - 29:40)
problems yes because boy (29:35 - 29:40)
I hope it's not destroyed somewhere (29:41 - 29:46)
because (29:44 - 29:46)
Paper Trails are a thing you need (29:47 - 29:52)
sometimes because people aren't great (29:49 - 29:54)
I (29:52 - 29:56)
if it's anything like nine takes other (29:54 - 29:59)
products there's four people managing (29:56 - 30:00)
the community that aren't getting paid (29:59 - 30:04)
they're just volunteers (30:00 - 30:07)
boy boy boy boy boy yeah oh I got a lot (30:04 - 30:09)
of thoughts about that one anyway uh (30:07 - 30:14)
speaking of more broken raids uh (30:09 - 30:14)
uh scarlet and violet (30:15 - 30:19)
you (30:16 - 30:19)
you would think (30:20 - 30:23)
that we would be talking about Delphox (30:23 - 30:29)
orilla Boom by now or maybe it's (30:27 - 30:33)
Chestnut again or even chess she said (30:29 - 30:34)
just Chestnut again but we're not (30:33 - 30:37)
because what's not happening those (30:34 - 30:40)
special raids they broke they broke (30:37 - 30:43)
their game hardcore something's wrong (30:40 - 30:45)
something's broke real bad and they're (30:43 - 30:47)
like just be quiet just don't say (30:45 - 30:49)
anything and maybe they won't ask (30:47 - 30:50)
questions (30:49 - 30:53)
I expected so Chestnut was supposed to (30:50 - 30:56)
repeat on the 18th 19th 20th (30:53 - 30:58)
that that's when it broke that's when (30:56 - 31:00)
they pulled it (30:58 - 31:03)
and then the 20 this weekend came and (31:00 - 31:06)
went and still nothing no it's just (31:03 - 31:08)
silence (31:06 - 31:10)
and again if we go back to the original (31:08 - 31:13)
weekend of 18 19 20th my thought process (31:10 - 31:14)
would have been (31:13 - 31:16)
oh this is more complicated than we (31:14 - 31:20)
think let's pull the raids remove great (31:16 - 31:22)
Tusk and iron treads (31:20 - 31:25)
just put back Chestnut because we've had (31:22 - 31:27)
they've had raids where it's just here's (31:25 - 31:30)
a seven star there's no other bonuses (31:27 - 31:33)
they didn't do that so it's like okay (31:30 - 31:35)
maybe they need a little more time 25th (31:33 - 31:37)
came around (31:35 - 31:41)
just nothing no chest no Chestnut no (31:37 - 31:43)
Bliss like literally nothing (31:41 - 31:46)
so it's like if iron Treads and gray (31:43 - 31:49)
tusk was the issue cool (31:46 - 31:51)
no one's no one's like upset that they (31:49 - 31:53)
have to wait an extra two weeks for that (31:51 - 31:56)
just put the chest knot back but it's (31:53 - 31:58)
not here how broken is your game they (31:56 - 32:03)
broke it they broke it so bad it is so (31:58 - 32:08)
broken I I can't even (32:03 - 32:12)
fathom what they did to break to break (32:08 - 32:14)
their game so hard and I don't think I (32:12 - 32:18)
can think of is this was the start of (32:14 - 32:22)
the DLC groundwork and it they're like (32:18 - 32:25)
scrambling to go backwards in time and (32:22 - 32:27)
undo (32:25 - 32:31)
undo everything and then go line by line (32:27 - 32:34)
to figure out where it went wrong (32:31 - 32:37)
because that this is this is such a (32:34 - 32:40)
roll it back but we can't go forward (32:37 - 32:42)
because we don't know what broke so we (32:40 - 32:44)
have to just roll it back and keep it (32:42 - 32:46)
frozen until we can figure it out and (32:44 - 32:48)
it's taking a lot longer because I'm (32:46 - 32:50)
wondering also if they're panicking (32:48 - 32:52)
about like if we roll it back (32:50 - 32:54)
are we going to corrupt people's data (32:52 - 32:56)
again because we don't really know what (32:54 - 32:59)
caused that like (32:56 - 33:01)
the amount of panic that has to be going (32:59 - 33:03)
I just want to be on the email chains (33:01 - 33:07)
that are like all caps at this point (33:03 - 33:12)
we're going back to version two (33:07 - 33:12)
I think I think (33:14 - 33:19)
there there was definitely a schedule (33:17 - 33:22)
because if you look at the Pokemon home (33:19 - 33:25)
app I know not a lot of people do there (33:22 - 33:27)
is a calendar in that app (33:25 - 33:29)
and then that app (33:27 - 33:31)
uh for a hot second (33:29 - 33:35)
it showed that Del Fox was next which is (33:31 - 33:36)
like not super surprising it was 50 50 (33:35 - 33:39)
delt Fox gorilla boom and it showed like (33:36 - 33:40)
the two weeks that it was supposed to (33:39 - 33:41)
run (33:40 - 33:44)
which was supposed to be starting on the (33:41 - 33:45)
25th (33:44 - 33:47)
and then going until the 28th and then (33:45 - 33:50)
repeating it was there for a hot second (33:47 - 33:53)
like one person screenshotted it I don't (33:50 - 33:54)
know maybe they Photoshopped it but like (33:53 - 33:57)
what a what a weird thing to like yeah (33:54 - 33:59)
fake in Photoshop when it's like (33:57 - 34:02)
well for the last 12 weeks we've just (33:59 - 34:04)
been doing raid right right so then (34:02 - 34:07)
there's only two left technically (34:04 - 34:08)
um (34:07 - 34:12)
I am just shocked (34:08 - 34:14)
that (34:12 - 34:16)
uh and a little bit relieved actually (34:14 - 34:18)
that we have a raid break but I'm just (34:16 - 34:21)
shocked that like (34:18 - 34:21)
what seemed to be such a small issue of (34:21 - 34:27)
like oh they're just dropping items that (34:26 - 34:30)
like they don't actually have like (34:27 - 34:34)
and we're going on week three weekend (34:30 - 34:36)
three of this (34:34 - 34:38)
and like maybe me again maybe it's we're (34:36 - 34:40)
recording this on Sunday morning Sunday (34:38 - 34:44)
night is usually when Pokemon news pops (34:40 - 34:45)
maybe this weekend things will be fixed (34:44 - 34:48)
but it is just like (34:45 - 34:52)
whoo yeah (34:48 - 34:52)
um and that's a compare it to Zelda (34:56 - 35:01)
uh but man Zelda has put out three (34:58 - 35:06)
updates in the two weeks it's been out (35:01 - 35:09)
maybe maybe an easier game to update (35:06 - 35:11)
since it's a single player experience (35:09 - 35:14)
but yeah I mean generally when there's (35:11 - 35:16)
not an online component (35:14 - 35:20)
those are generally easier to fix (35:16 - 35:22)
because you're not having to worry about (35:20 - 35:25)
a lot of additional extra factors when (35:22 - 35:27)
you put more strain on a single (35:25 - 35:29)
cartridge (35:27 - 35:29)
I know um it took about two weeks for (35:29 - 35:36)
Pokemon to fix the duplication glitch (35:32 - 35:38)
and then that was like (35:36 - 35:40)
they fix it halfway because if you (35:38 - 35:42)
already so how the duplication glitch (35:40 - 35:44)
worked in Scarlet Violet is you (35:42 - 35:46)
duplicated like your meridon and then (35:44 - 35:48)
when you went to like put your miraid on (35:46 - 35:49)
in your bag you could like duplicate (35:48 - 35:52)
other things and so when they fix that (35:49 - 35:56)
after two weeks if you still had the (35:52 - 35:57)
they pretty much prevented you from (35:56 - 35:59)
duplicating your ride on but if you (35:57 - 36:02)
already had it you could continue to (35:59 - 36:04)
duplicate and that took another like two (36:02 - 36:06)
weeks to fix (36:04 - 36:09)
and then there was duplication in Zelda (36:06 - 36:12)
and uh Nintendo game freak Pokemon (36:09 - 36:16)
company they don't like that so (36:12 - 36:17)
they they (36:16 - 36:20)
Nintendo fixed the duplication in Zelda (36:17 - 36:21)
and it took them exactly two weeks to do (36:20 - 36:23)
that (36:21 - 36:25)
um and then of course people found like (36:23 - 36:27)
another way to duplicate it's not as (36:25 - 36:30)
efficient I like I didn't duplicate it (36:27 - 36:32)
all anyways because I don't because (36:30 - 36:34)
because when I get invited to the Zelda (36:32 - 36:35)
World tournament they're gonna see that (36:34 - 36:38)
I have a clean record yep (36:35 - 36:39)
um (36:38 - 36:41)
but then when I saw people like here's (36:39 - 36:43)
the new way to duplicate I was like man (36:41 - 36:47)
that this seems like a hat (36:43 - 36:49)
whatever I mean play the game you spend (36:47 - 36:51)
your seventy dollars on a plane how you (36:49 - 36:53)
want I guess but like I don't know (36:51 - 36:54)
everything sometimes wonder if it's just (36:53 - 36:56)
one of those things where it's like yeah (36:54 - 36:58)
this takes longer but I'm just doing it (36:56 - 37:00)
to prove that I can (36:58 - 37:03)
other than it that it gives me some sort (37:00 - 37:05)
of weird Advantage because sometimes I (37:03 - 37:07)
people have walked me through like these (37:05 - 37:08)
are the glitch steps and I'm like there (37:07 - 37:10)
is no way (37:08 - 37:13)
I am doing all of that there is just no (37:10 - 37:16)
I do not care enough (37:13 - 37:20)
when it gets past step three I'm out (37:16 - 37:23)
this is like a 17 step process that at (37:20 - 37:24)
some point you mess up one of those (37:23 - 37:26)
steps you risk erasing your game no (37:24 - 37:28)
thank you people are like don't you want (37:26 - 37:30)
to duplicate the master ball like what (37:28 - 37:32)
the last time I used to master ball was (37:30 - 37:34)
in black and white against the heartier (37:32 - 37:38)
like isn't that ever if I want duplicate (37:34 - 37:40)
master balls I'll just wonder trade a (37:38 - 37:43)
sword I'll get like 80 without even (37:40 - 37:46)
knowing it (37:43 - 37:46)
um (37:47 - 37:52)
look I have again I have no problem with (37:48 - 37:55)
uh game freak taking their time to fix (37:52 - 37:58)
the hot mess that is Scarlet violet (37:55 - 38:01)
but uh I guess maybe it's a true (37:58 - 38:03)
blessing that the (38:01 - 38:07)
summer DLC (38:03 - 38:09)
the summer camp DLC we're supposed to (38:07 - 38:11)
get is not actually coming out in summer (38:09 - 38:13)
like (38:11 - 38:17)
like they clearly need all the time (38:13 - 38:19)
very curious if it's just gonna keep (38:17 - 38:21)
getting pushed back farther and farther (38:19 - 38:22)
and further (38:21 - 38:26)
be the very tail end of fall (38:22 - 38:26)
well we'll probably never know of like (38:27 - 38:33)
who's setting the schedule I we we all (38:29 - 38:36)
understand that there there is the Cog (38:33 - 38:38)
in the machine that is Pokemon where (38:36 - 38:40)
like they have they have to line up with (38:38 - 38:44)
anime and TCG releases and the games and (38:40 - 38:46)
marketing and we we under everyone (38:44 - 38:49)
understands that right I don't think (38:46 - 38:51)
they do there's so many people who do (38:49 - 38:54)
not seem to understand people listening (38:51 - 38:58)
to this show understand that (38:54 - 39:00)
and so it's very hard to delay any of (38:58 - 39:02)
those products because they're so (39:00 - 39:04)
reliant on each other there is no like (39:02 - 39:06)
Zelda anime right maybe there will be (39:04 - 39:08)
where they're like well we can't delay (39:06 - 39:10)
tears of the Kingdom another year we (39:08 - 39:12)
have the anime is done it's just sitting (39:10 - 39:14)
there collecting dust so like didn't (39:12 - 39:15)
they do one Zelda anime and it was (39:14 - 39:18)
atrocious they did they did yeah or link (39:15 - 39:22)
is like ooh Smoochum time (39:18 - 39:22)
um but I I want to be optimistic in the (39:23 - 39:28)
worst way (39:26 - 39:30)
I think if (39:28 - 39:34)
I think okay so I I hear me out listener (39:30 - 39:35)
if you're if you're if you're driving (39:34 - 39:36)
your car pull over to the side of the (39:35 - 39:38)
road because I need you to Envision this (39:36 - 39:41)
you're at your nine to five right you (39:38 - 39:45)
have told your boss that that that (39:41 - 39:49)
you cannot get this project done in this (39:45 - 39:51)
time frame because it will be it will be (39:49 - 39:54)
dog water if you do and you need more (39:51 - 39:57)
time and they say no we gotta do it (39:54 - 40:01)
anyways and and lo and behold the whole (39:57 - 40:02)
project is a hot mess you didn't hit the (40:01 - 40:06)
deadline you tried your hardest (40:02 - 40:08)
and you've proven your boss wrong in the (40:06 - 40:11)
worst possible way I hope that scarlet (40:08 - 40:14)
and violet is this to whoever makes the (40:11 - 40:16)
schedule whether that's internal to Game (40:14 - 40:17)
Freak whether that's the Pokemon company (40:16 - 40:19)
whether that's Nintendo I hope that they (40:17 - 40:22)
just go like because I think at its core (40:19 - 40:24)
scarlet and violet is there's something (40:22 - 40:26)
there there's like a really good (40:24 - 40:29)
gameplay loop I think the economy is (40:26 - 40:32)
great I think the Pokemon designs are (40:29 - 40:33)
absolutely fantastic I think the (40:32 - 40:35)
characters are fantastic I think the (40:33 - 40:40)
world is a little Black Luster and empty (40:35 - 40:42)
um I think but I do think some of the (40:40 - 40:44)
things they did were just fantastic and (40:42 - 40:48)
I think at its core it's there but like (40:44 - 40:51)
again I just hope that like this game (40:48 - 40:54)
being as broken as it is (40:51 - 40:57)
they they go like (40:54 - 40:57)
we we need we need we need help we need (40:58 - 41:03)
something we need to make sure that (41:01 - 41:05)
generation 10 (41:03 - 41:08)
is as good as (41:05 - 41:11)
Mario Odyssey or breath of the wild or (41:08 - 41:14)
tears like we want like I don't know you (41:11 - 41:16)
know what I'm saying we want something (41:14 - 41:18)
in the in the worst way that this (41:16 - 41:20)
hopefully this game shows like (41:18 - 41:24)
we need more time I mean that (41:20 - 41:28)
I don't know that time is (41:24 - 41:31)
the factor (41:28 - 41:33)
um I can because like people like oh if (41:31 - 41:35)
they hadn't like we're almost at a year (41:33 - 41:37)
in the game and we'll see if a year out (41:35 - 41:39)
when the DLC comes if they suddenly (41:37 - 41:41)
improve all the glitches and things (41:39 - 41:45)
looks mystically better I I I don't know (41:41 - 41:47)
that (41:45 - 41:50)
we can just point to they need more time (41:47 - 41:53)
I think one thing we'll see with the (41:50 - 41:56)
next thing is what lessons did they (41:53 - 41:59)
learn and how do they reprioritize to (41:56 - 42:01)
make a better experience because time (41:59 - 42:05)
doesn't necessarily equate to being a (42:01 - 42:07)
better experience I have been on (42:05 - 42:10)
thousands of projects where they get an (42:07 - 42:12)
extra three months and they drive it (42:10 - 42:15)
down such a weird path that ultimately (42:12 - 42:17)
you get a worse product because they had (42:15 - 42:19)
so much extra time and they got into (42:17 - 42:22)
this weird swirl of focusing on the (42:19 - 42:24)
wrong thing like at some point things (42:22 - 42:27)
just need to be done (42:24 - 42:29)
and (42:27 - 42:33)
what we need for them to look at is we (42:29 - 42:35)
prioritize the wrong things we budgeted (42:33 - 42:39)
the wrong way we didn't do XYZ the right (42:35 - 42:41)
things because I I don't think we can (42:39 - 42:42)
say (42:41 - 42:45)
if they had more time it would be better (42:42 - 42:48)
like we'll see if we get to the DLC (42:45 - 42:50)
because that head would have given them (42:48 - 42:52)
an extra year and if suddenly all these (42:50 - 42:54)
things are gone because they fix it in (42:52 - 42:55)
the DLC then yeah we could say if they (42:54 - 42:57)
had an extra year and had done this work (42:55 - 43:00)
but there's no guaranteeing that (42:57 - 43:02)
had they had the extra year not getting (43:00 - 43:04)
it in front of so many people and (43:02 - 43:06)
running into so many problems that they (43:04 - 43:07)
would have ever thought the problem (43:06 - 43:10)
existed at all like it is it is (43:07 - 43:13)
short-sighted on multiple levels to say (43:10 - 43:17)
just give them more time when we have no (43:13 - 43:18)
clue (43:17 - 43:21)
really how long any of it it take like (43:18 - 43:22)
they could have been planning this for (43:21 - 43:25)
10 years like this is where this game is (43:22 - 43:26)
going to be and we're store boarding and (43:25 - 43:28)
we're coming up with designs but then we (43:26 - 43:30)
only have this time for production (43:28 - 43:31)
because this is where the budgets are (43:30 - 43:34)
like the machine to make these things is (43:31 - 43:40)
so incredibly complex that it's it is (43:34 - 43:44)
unfair to them to say have somebody else (43:40 - 43:46)
make it and give them more time because (43:44 - 43:48)
we don't know that any of that would (43:46 - 43:51)
ever make a difference (43:48 - 43:51)
I look at like let's go Pikachu let's go (43:52 - 43:56)
Eevee (43:54 - 43:59)
and that's an incredibly small game (43:56 - 44:01)
compared to scarlet and violet and it's (43:59 - 44:03)
still I think (44:01 - 44:07)
the best switch Pokemon game out there (44:03 - 44:10)
it is all of the following animations (44:07 - 44:14)
the mechanics how like I think that game (44:10 - 44:16)
is gorgeous compared to scarlet and (44:14 - 44:19)
violet I think it looks so good but like (44:16 - 44:21)
it's missing a lot of features like (44:19 - 44:23)
there is no breeding right there is no (44:21 - 44:25)
like held items and that's fine that's (44:23 - 44:27)
like that's not a complaint it's just it (44:25 - 44:29)
doesn't have it but it just felt (44:27 - 44:33)
for their first game on switch like the (44:29 - 44:36)
PC anywhere (44:33 - 44:38)
um (44:36 - 44:38)
it like it just felt like (44:38 - 44:45)
because it wasn't this Grand huge game (44:41 - 44:48)
yeah also they already had the framework (44:45 - 44:51)
of Kanto it felt like they could hyper (44:48 - 44:54)
focus in and make a great product and I (44:51 - 44:56)
kind of feel the same way about Legends (44:54 - 44:59)
Arceus yep where again it's not this (44:56 - 45:01)
huge I mean like they they sold it as (44:59 - 45:03)
like this semi-open world kind of thing (45:01 - 45:05)
but it's it's a really small game (45:03 - 45:07)
honestly it is (45:05 - 45:09)
um like I look at (45:07 - 45:12)
like I look at my Legends play time and (45:09 - 45:14)
I'm like wow I I'm not even close to (45:12 - 45:16)
let's go not even close to bdsp not even (45:14 - 45:18)
close because like at a certain point in (45:16 - 45:20)
Legends you're just like well I'm done (45:18 - 45:24)
you're done yeah and that's okay like it (45:20 - 45:26)
one thing we can always say when they (45:24 - 45:28)
limit the scope of a game they can (45:26 - 45:30)
tighten what they do and polish what (45:28 - 45:34)
they have when the games Focus (45:30 - 45:37)
shrinks when you cut things out you can (45:34 - 45:40)
spend more time on other things and that (45:37 - 45:43)
is again one thing I don't think people (45:40 - 45:44)
have a lot of discussions about when (45:43 - 45:47)
they say oh give them more time it's (45:44 - 45:49)
like okay what do you want them to cut (45:47 - 45:51)
though because they have proven when (45:49 - 45:53)
they cut things (45:51 - 45:57)
they do it better when they don't have (45:53 - 46:00)
to compensate for large scale stuff like (45:57 - 46:03)
they cut abilities they cut I don't know (46:00 - 46:05)
they cut stuff out of out of scarlet and (46:03 - 46:07)
violet and it's a pretty bad shape in (46:05 - 46:09)
those cases they cut out a whole lot of (46:07 - 46:12)
quality of life improvements they did (46:09 - 46:15)
um but like you still have some of the (46:12 - 46:19)
major time Hogs like breeding outbreaks (46:15 - 46:22)
you know they still have 400 Pokemon (46:19 - 46:25)
they still have open world and they (46:22 - 46:28)
replaced it with other large items which (46:25 - 46:31)
is a very different thing than you knew (46:28 - 46:32)
exactly what you're getting with let's (46:31 - 46:34)
go we've been to this reason a billion (46:32 - 46:36)
times they don't have to redesign the (46:34 - 46:38)
region they cut out abilities they cut (46:36 - 46:40)
up reading they cut out that they cut (46:38 - 46:41)
out standards they cut out a lot of (46:40 - 46:45)
things for those games and they're great (46:41 - 46:47)
they cut out multiplayer (46:45 - 46:49)
in legends of our kids and you'd never (46:47 - 46:52)
see it there's no competitive there's no (46:49 - 46:55)
huge there's no real after game so they (46:52 - 46:57)
could really focus on (46:55 - 47:00)
what they wanted to present and I think (46:57 - 47:02)
it is a interesting conversation for (47:00 - 47:04)
people to have with themselves of what (47:02 - 47:07)
would you like them to cut out (47:04 - 47:09)
to make what do you think is core and (47:07 - 47:11)
essential that you'd want them to focus (47:09 - 47:13)
on and what would you want them to cut (47:11 - 47:16)
out and leave behind to get a better (47:13 - 47:18)
product knowing that most likely the one (47:16 - 47:20)
thing that they will probably never be (47:18 - 47:22)
able to change is the amount of time (47:20 - 47:25)
they have to get a product out (47:22 - 47:27)
like there are too many parts of that (47:25 - 47:29)
moving train to ever say they're going (47:27 - 47:32)
to magically get another year (47:29 - 47:32)
yeah I don't I don't know if it's (47:33 - 47:38)
another year I I don't know if it's (47:35 - 47:41)
external help (47:38 - 47:45)
um we we saw ilka's capabilities (47:41 - 47:45)
um I don't know what it is I think the (47:47 - 47:53)
easy thing is to say give them more time (47:51 - 47:55)
I think the other easy thing to say is (47:53 - 47:58)
like hire more people but yes in in in (47:55 - 48:02)
real world scenarios (47:58 - 48:03)
uh (48:02 - 48:05)
I would I would say like when I had a (48:03 - 48:06)
nine-to-five job it became more (48:05 - 48:07)
efficient when we actually lost people (48:06 - 48:09)
because then there was less people that (48:07 - 48:11)
we had to like go through to get wait (48:09 - 48:13)
for approval and stuff and like what (48:11 - 48:16)
Greg said with the time (48:13 - 48:16)
I'm I I don't know which what needs to (48:16 - 48:23)
be done but (48:20 - 48:27)
iron trans and great Tusk are not the (48:23 - 48:31)
first issues of these games (48:27 - 48:31)
and I I (48:32 - 48:37)
would like to assume that the people (48:34 - 48:39)
working on Pokemon (48:37 - 48:41)
they enjoy it they love it they don't (48:39 - 48:45)
want to put out a bad game (48:41 - 48:46)
and there's a lot of bad games that have (48:45 - 48:49)
come out like cyberpunk also came out (48:46 - 48:52)
incredibly broken yeah no man's Sky came (48:49 - 48:54)
out incredibly broken that new Golem (48:52 - 48:56)
game is is (48:54 - 48:58)
I've never had so much fun reading (48:56 - 48:59)
reviews for a video game I was never (48:58 - 49:01)
going to play until I read the reviews (48:59 - 49:03)
for Gollum (49:01 - 49:06)
um I mean I always asked to say this (49:03 - 49:09)
you don't have to enjoy it to still want (49:06 - 49:11)
to put out a good product I've worked on (49:09 - 49:13)
a lot of things where I'm like this is (49:11 - 49:15)
not enjoyable but I still need to put (49:13 - 49:17)
out a good products like their enjoyment (49:15 - 49:21)
of it is a benefit (49:17 - 49:24)
feature like everybody wants to put out (49:21 - 49:28)
a good product like they you you I one (49:24 - 49:29)
thing I always tell people you'll be (49:28 - 49:32)
much happier if you assume that (49:29 - 49:34)
everybody is trying their best right (49:32 - 49:37)
people aren't walking into work they're (49:34 - 49:38)
walking into your lives (49:37 - 49:41)
to be like I'm here to actively make you (49:38 - 49:43)
miserable and if there is a person that (49:41 - 49:45)
is like that cut them out of your life (49:43 - 49:48)
but they are very very rare and you will (49:45 - 49:50)
get along better and more understanding (49:48 - 49:51)
with people particularly in work (49:50 - 49:54)
situations where they've asked you the (49:51 - 49:57)
same question 14 times like okay there (49:54 - 49:59)
is something at play here (49:57 - 50:02)
but they are still trying to do their (49:59 - 50:04)
best so I'm not going to get mad that (50:02 - 50:06)
this is the 14th time they've asked it (50:04 - 50:08)
I'm going to perhaps (50:06 - 50:10)
come up with a different way to answer (50:08 - 50:12)
it because maybe the 14 times answer it (50:10 - 50:14)
doesn't make sense right like maybe I'm (50:12 - 50:16)
not communicating well like you'll be (50:14 - 50:19)
better off assuming that they are trying (50:16 - 50:21)
to do their best instead of assuming (50:19 - 50:24)
they're trying to rip you off (50:21 - 50:25)
um (50:24 - 50:28)
these things particularly game design is (50:25 - 50:32)
incredibly complicated I I'm getting (50:28 - 50:34)
prepped to do do another Kickstarter and (50:32 - 50:37)
the amount of I forget how complicated (50:34 - 50:41)
these things get very very quick you (50:37 - 50:43)
just hit the kick you just hit the go (50:41 - 50:44)
live button on Kickstarter don't think (50:43 - 50:46)
where's the link I'm like I haven't even (50:44 - 50:48)
been approved I've already I did (50:46 - 50:50)
something with Kickstarter before and I (50:48 - 50:52)
still have to go through an entire (50:50 - 50:55)
approval process just to be able to do a (50:52 - 50:58)
second one and they're already mad at me (50:55 - 51:00)
because even though I've put the date (50:58 - 51:01)
out like (51:00 - 51:03)
12 days from when I submitted it they're (51:01 - 51:05)
like well we were really like eight (51:03 - 51:07)
business days I'm like well you have (51:05 - 51:08)
that (51:07 - 51:14)
easily but okay cool like (51:08 - 51:16)
these things don't like these things can (51:14 - 51:19)
rapidly get out of hand and they're way (51:16 - 51:22)
more complicated than people often think (51:19 - 51:24)
and (51:22 - 51:26)
it gets even more complicated when you (51:24 - 51:27)
have to assume like just because (51:26 - 51:30)
Nintendo makes a lot of money do not (51:27 - 51:32)
assume that they have an unlimited (51:30 - 51:33)
budget because unlimited budgets don't (51:32 - 51:35)
exist (51:33 - 51:38)
right like they have to consider told me (51:35 - 51:42)
every time they sell a Piplup plush game (51:38 - 51:44)
freak gets an extra day to finish their (51:42 - 51:46)
game oh true I forgot that rule it's (51:44 - 51:49)
written into their contract but like (51:46 - 51:52)
also it's not like at the start of the (51:49 - 51:54)
project it's not like three years ago (51:52 - 51:58)
game freak said okay here's 10 million (51:54 - 52:01)
dollars make scarlet and violet (51:58 - 52:03)
no it's like okay you're at the start of (52:01 - 52:06)
the project here's the first two million (52:03 - 52:07)
dollars (52:06 - 52:10)
and if you do it well you'll get the (52:07 - 52:12)
next two million and if you don't we're (52:10 - 52:15)
killing the project right like you don't (52:12 - 52:18)
just get a lump sum of money you get (52:15 - 52:19)
that (52:18 - 52:21)
when you hit (52:19 - 52:22)
there was a year where there was no (52:21 - 52:25)
Pokemon game yep (52:22 - 52:29)
and it ironically would have been the (52:25 - 52:32)
year of Pokemon Z (52:29 - 52:35)
not there no game nothing (52:32 - 52:39)
I mean you have to look deep into the (52:35 - 52:42)
actual like the sausage getting made it (52:39 - 52:46)
you know is a is a very complicated (52:42 - 52:51)
process and it's not as simple as people (52:46 - 52:55)
want it to be that's sad like (52:51 - 52:58)
I would love to talk about what their (52:55 - 53:02)
prioritizations look like what they how (52:58 - 53:04)
they lay out their schedule what their (53:02 - 53:06)
planning looks like but most importantly (53:04 - 53:08)
I really would love to talk to them (53:06 - 53:10)
about their QA process like how do you (53:08 - 53:13)
QA these things how many people do you (53:10 - 53:15)
bring in what are you doing what does (53:13 - 53:17)
that look like (53:15 - 53:19)
because I think that's again I've said (53:17 - 53:21)
it before where I think most companies (53:19 - 53:25)
fall down is during QA (53:21 - 53:25)
I learned recently that one of my (53:26 - 53:33)
friends friends twins was QA for was a (53:28 - 53:36)
game tester for the new (53:33 - 53:38)
uh Zelda game (53:36 - 53:40)
and clearly that went through a whole (53:38 - 53:42)
lot of it they were doing it for a very (53:40 - 53:44)
long time yeah yeah I thought I read an (53:42 - 53:46)
article that they finished the game a (53:44 - 53:48)
year ago but the last (53:46 - 53:51)
12 months was just polish (53:48 - 53:53)
like they were we're adding nothing else (53:51 - 53:56)
that sounds about right we are just (53:53 - 53:59)
making sure that everything is working (53:56 - 54:01)
and it's crazy the way that game works (53:59 - 54:05)
uh on an unreal scale but also even then (54:01 - 54:08)
there are things that happen right like (54:05 - 54:10)
they spent a year and they're still (54:08 - 54:12)
things that break oh yeah yeah yeah yeah (54:10 - 54:15)
because like I've I've definitely even (54:12 - 54:17)
like oh that's not supposed to happen (54:15 - 54:20)
right like even then it's you know even (54:17 - 54:22)
a with a game that they made sure (54:20 - 54:24)
absolutely went through a full vetted (54:22 - 54:25)
process (54:24 - 54:28)
you know a hundred eyes is different (54:25 - 54:30)
than a million eyes there are just (54:28 - 54:32)
sometimes things that like (54:30 - 54:34)
I sometimes think that Pokemon players (54:32 - 54:36)
don't Branch out and play other games (54:34 - 54:40)
like I I played Apex Legends for the (54:36 - 54:42)
first time in like two months the game's (54:40 - 54:45)
like five years old and like my first (54:42 - 54:48)
match I was just like oh this is this is (54:45 - 54:51)
broken like I can't I can't I can't see (54:48 - 54:53)
my character right now like what what (54:51 - 54:54)
has happened (54:53 - 54:56)
like what has happened oh all the (54:54 - 54:58)
Shadows are just gone I guess I guess (54:56 - 55:00)
the sun isn't out anymore for some (54:58 - 55:01)
reason (55:00 - 55:02)
um (55:01 - 55:05)
it's like I I totally understand that (55:02 - 55:07)
games are super complicated I think I (55:05 - 55:09)
think for for a person that doesn't (55:07 - 55:10)
understand that they just want to buy a (55:09 - 55:12)
Pokemon game and for it to be a good (55:10 - 55:14)
Pokemon game and (55:12 - 55:17)
unfortunately with scarlet and violet (55:14 - 55:20)
it's just not that it's just not at that (55:17 - 55:22)
level it's just there's just (55:20 - 55:25)
something that is constantly wrong all (55:22 - 55:27)
the time (55:25 - 55:30)
and I just hope or wish there will be (55:27 - 55:34)
like a big enough update to fix it but (55:30 - 55:36)
I I don't think that's happening I think (55:34 - 55:37)
like (55:36 - 55:40)
when DLC arrives maybe DLC will (55:37 - 55:42)
alleviate or fix some stuff (55:40 - 55:44)
but (55:42 - 55:47)
I'm more expecting DLC to be holding new (55:44 - 55:48)
content (55:47 - 55:52)
but there was things the 1.3.1 that came (55:48 - 55:53)
out (55:52 - 55:55)
and people were like I hope this fixes (55:53 - 55:57)
some stuff and it was like no this (55:55 - 55:59)
update was not planned this update was (55:57 - 56:01)
just to fix a ladder issue for Japanese (55:59 - 56:03)
and Korean players I don't think you're (56:01 - 56:07)
either of those but uh like this was an (56:03 - 56:08)
emergency push update that they happened (56:07 - 56:11)
to fix they fix that faster than iron (56:08 - 56:13)
Treads and great (56:11 - 56:14)
task (56:13 - 56:18)
um and it was cool it was it was nice to (56:14 - 56:21)
see them fix an issue so quickly (56:18 - 56:25)
uh but yeah um (56:21 - 56:25)
maybe in six months we can be like the (56:25 - 56:33)
game is running great perfect (56:28 - 56:33)
well let's run to a break and then we (56:33 - 56:36)
just have a couple really small news (56:35 - 56:37)
articles (56:36 - 56:41)
um so we will be right back (56:37 - 56:41)
and we are back from our break (56:42 - 56:47)
um (56:45 - 56:50)
got some it's got some sad news (56:47 - 56:51)
I (56:50 - 56:55)
am devastated (56:51 - 56:57)
uh this is off go (56:55 - 57:00)

anything else (58:40 - 58:44)
yeah it says we apologize for the (58:42 - 58:46)
inconvenience our website is experience (58:44 - 58:48)
high levels of traffic causing it un uh (58:46 - 58:50)
unavailable we are overwhelmed at the (58:48 - 58:53)
response we are receiving from our (58:50 - 58:55)
announcement of service termination we (58:53 - 58:58)
appreciate your engagement (58:55 - 58:58)
thank you (59:00 - 59:05)
I mean this is high typical though I (59:02 - 59:06)
thought the internet told me that the (59:05 - 59:08)
Pokemon you slap Pokemon at anything and (59:06 - 59:10)
it will always be successful What's (59:08 - 59:12)
Happening Here (59:10 - 59:13)
they also have more expensive shirts (59:12 - 59:16)
they were very expensive I mean I mean (59:13 - 59:19)
they were appropriately expensive they (59:16 - 59:22)
were they were the right price for (59:19 - 59:23)
I will say those are my price for the (59:22 - 59:25)
quality you were getting yeah they were (59:23 - 59:27)
appropriately expensive shirts but they (59:25 - 59:30)
were still expensive yeah yeah (59:27 - 59:32)
I mean like (59:30 - 59:33)
they are the shirts you probably should (59:32 - 59:36)
be wearing to a wedding not the like 13 (59:33 - 59:38)
one you got from Kohl's that will fall (59:36 - 59:41)
apart in like two wash Cycles yeah I've (59:38 - 59:43)
always made 13 bucks for it that's true (59:41 - 59:46)
yeah that's true 13 is a wedding versus (59:43 - 59:49)
100 plus (59:46 - 59:49)
100 plus yeah that will probably last (59:50 - 59:53)
you (59:52 - 59:55)
for I mean for as long as you take care (59:53 - 59:58)
of them yeah you hit you hit it with (59:55 - 60:00)
that dry cleaning (59:58 - 60:03)
paying for dry cleaning dry cleaning's (60:00 - 60:05)
so cheap it's like six dollars a shirt (60:03 - 60:07)
yeah or I can go back downstairs the (60:05 - 60:09)
cost of the coal shirt I'm going (60:07 - 60:12)
downstairs and just wash it for free and (60:09 - 60:14)
read the instruction labels and do a (60:12 - 60:16)
good job like (60:14 - 60:20)
uh you you are downplaying the magic (60:16 - 60:23)
that is dry cleaning there is nothing (60:20 - 60:25)
but there's like two things great in (60:23 - 60:29)
life number one using a Q-tip to get the (60:25 - 60:31)
water out of your ears I don't care I (60:29 - 60:32)
don't even want to hear it YouTube (60:31 - 60:34)
comments if they're gonna be like you're (60:32 - 60:36)
not supposed to use Q-tips no it feels (60:34 - 60:39)
great I love it it is my favorite thing (60:36 - 60:41)
to do after a shower is to dry my ears (60:39 - 60:44)
like with them with a Q-tip love it (60:41 - 60:47)
absolutely number two is putting on a (60:44 - 60:52)
dry clean shirt it feels incredible (60:47 - 60:56)
nothing beats a dry clean shirt now if (60:52 - 60:59)
you shower use the Q-tips put on a dry (60:56 - 61:00)
cleaned shirt there's no way you could (60:59 - 61:03)
have a bad day (61:00 - 61:03)
your use of Q-tips is rendering me (61:04 - 61:07)
speechless (61:06 - 61:11)
I mean if you don't dig in there (61:07 - 61:14)
what's the point of living (61:11 - 61:14)
look I trust myself to purply wash a (61:15 - 61:22)
shirt I've yet to find a dry cleaner (61:20 - 61:28)
that I dressed with My Precious Cargo (61:22 - 61:28)
dry cleaning is great (61:29 - 61:34)
though (61:31 - 61:36)
you got that's that's like another thing (61:34 - 61:39)
like finding a good dry cleaner is like (61:36 - 61:42)
finding a coffee shop that remember (61:39 - 61:46)
does not say dry clean only learn how to (61:42 - 61:48)
wash your clothes properly (61:46 - 61:50)
I'm with Greg on this one (61:48 - 61:53)
I mean unless you just have the money (61:50 - 61:56)
and don't have the time right you can (61:53 - 61:59)
send out to a laundry service to like a (61:56 - 62:02)
gas I don't know but like if it doesn't (61:59 - 62:05)
say dry clean only (62:02 - 62:05)
you can take care of it yourself just (62:06 - 62:10)
okay no one's saying you can't you can (62:09 - 62:12)
make coffee at home too but sometimes (62:10 - 62:15)
you want to go out to the Starbucks (62:12 - 62:16)
yeah but the difference about going out (62:15 - 62:19)
to Starbucks is they have paid to have a (62:16 - 62:20)
stock full of things that I'm not paying (62:19 - 62:23)
extra money to have that all in my house (62:20 - 62:25)
I'm I'm all I'm washing I'm getting the (62:23 - 62:27)
stain (62:25 - 62:29)
on your impressed (62:27 - 62:30)
like multiple things that are happening (62:29 - 62:33)
Greg they're putting the lines in my (62:30 - 62:34)
pants (62:33 - 62:38)
oh God I hate that look so much oh I (62:34 - 62:40)
love it the worst thing are people who (62:38 - 62:42)
ironed (62:40 - 62:44)
the crisp lines in their jeans you (62:42 - 62:47)
haven't (62:44 - 62:47)
have no clue (62:50 - 62:53)
some people put their jeans in the (62:58 - 63:01)
freezer those people also need to be (62:59 - 63:03)
jailed I tried that once I don't know (63:01 - 63:05)
how drums work (63:03 - 63:05)
I will say the freezer did make it smell (63:06 - 63:12)
like pizza rolls and ice (63:08 - 63:12)
um don't have that baking soda to absorb (63:15 - 63:18)
all the smells so it doesn't get what (63:17 - 63:20)
are we talking about original Stitch I'm (63:18 - 63:23)
really gonna miss it I'm still on their (63:20 - 63:26)
website it works for me (63:23 - 63:26)
Hannah what are the like the the two (63:27 - 63:31)
shirts you would get if the website (63:29 - 63:32)
comes back up for everyone that's not (63:31 - 63:35)
Greg I haven't looked at the designs in (63:32 - 63:37)
a while I have a horsey one I have a (63:35 - 63:39)
horsey one because horsey was my first (63:37 - 63:41)
Pokemon card and (63:39 - 63:43)
it doesn't fit right (63:41 - 63:46)
and I was hoping to maybe recreate it (63:43 - 63:48)
yeah Greg and I were talking about this (63:46 - 63:50)
you put in all your measurements but (63:48 - 63:51)
they didn't listen to all my (63:50 - 63:53)
measurements because they apparently (63:51 - 63:55)
according to Greg don't customize it (63:53 - 63:59)
they customize very specific aspects of (63:55 - 64:01)
it but generally (63:59 - 64:05)
it is not going to be the fit around the (64:01 - 64:07)
chest and the fit around the stomach (64:05 - 64:09)
those seem to be not (64:07 - 64:12)
customizable (64:09 - 64:13)
um they tend to really only be able to (64:12 - 64:18)
do the collar size and sleeve length the (64:13 - 64:22)
rest is really they really go by fashion (64:18 - 64:24)
and Industry standards which is a way (64:22 - 64:26)
that you know obviously it is easier for (64:24 - 64:28)
them to (64:26 - 64:32)
save money that way because they have (64:28 - 64:34)
a wider variety like they're putting the (64:32 - 64:36)
pieces together to make them they're not (64:34 - 64:39)
spoiler they're not like cutting each (64:36 - 64:41)
shirt to order because that would be way (64:39 - 64:42)
more expensive like they do have (64:41 - 64:44)
patterns so they do have set things and (64:42 - 64:46)
they're piecing them together (64:44 - 64:49)
um but in general they are not as (64:46 - 64:53)
customizable as people (64:49 - 64:53)
as an average height or also considered (64:53 - 64:59)
short female person (64:57 - 65:01)
um they got the sleeves the right length (64:59 - 65:04)
it was great I've never had a button-up (65:01 - 65:05)
shirt where the sleeves were actually (65:04 - 65:07)
the right length and weren't too long (65:05 - 65:10)
but I couldn't button it up all the way (65:07 - 65:12)
the Torso is just not the right size and (65:10 - 65:13)
I don't know whether it's because I (65:12 - 65:16)
chose the woman's measurements and so (65:13 - 65:17)
they were going off of japanese-based (65:16 - 65:20)
models and that just didn't work out for (65:17 - 65:23)
me but yeah you really like you really (65:20 - 65:25)
have to dig into the website also to (65:23 - 65:29)
look at their size charts to determine (65:25 - 65:32)
how (65:29 - 65:35)
close their size charts as they listed (65:32 - 65:36)
are to what you want because they are (65:35 - 65:39)
different they do (65:36 - 65:42)
um they're a little bit different than (65:39 - 65:44)
a lot of what's happening in America (65:42 - 65:46)
which is a lot of vanity sizing so you (65:44 - 65:48)
really sort of have to know your own (65:46 - 65:50)
measurements and really pay attention to (65:48 - 65:52)
their size chart and understand that (65:50 - 65:56)
they're not gonna vary too greatly on (65:52 - 65:58)
shoulder chest and stomach those are (65:56 - 66:01)
pretty much going to be set and they're (65:58 - 66:04)
gonna really do your sleeve length and (66:01 - 66:05)
your neck and those are things you have (66:04 - 66:09)
the most control over yeah I measured (66:05 - 66:11)
the same day that I ordered and I still (66:09 - 66:13)
didn't quite get it right so I was (66:11 - 66:14)
really hoping to have another (66:13 - 66:17)
opportunity which (66:14 - 66:19)
might not happen I mean technically you (66:17 - 66:22)
you do you have like 14 days I don't (66:19 - 66:24)
know if I have the money for that right (66:22 - 66:27)
now yeah I think I think a big worry for (66:24 - 66:30)
some people was I don't want to spend a (66:27 - 66:32)
hundred dollars on a shirt and then it (66:30 - 66:35)
not fit yeah (66:32 - 66:36)
um and there is some tailoring you can (66:35 - 66:39)
do uh you could you can always make it (66:36 - 66:42)
smaller you can't necessarily make it (66:39 - 66:45)
bigger so if your sleeves are too long (66:42 - 66:48)
that's an easy fix if your sleeves are (66:45 - 66:52)
too short that's not an easy I mean the (66:48 - 66:53)
thing that I would suggest is if you're (66:52 - 66:56)
going to make the investment (66:53 - 66:59)
and you worried about it being too small (66:56 - 67:01)
go a little bit bigger because you can (66:59 - 67:03)
take it to a tailor (67:01 - 67:07)
and the tailors can customize it from (67:03 - 67:10)
there like you can't add (67:07 - 67:13)
but you can still take away like there's (67:10 - 67:16)
still ways to undo it and make it a (67:13 - 67:18)
little bit better but uh really you do (67:16 - 67:22)
need to dig into their size chart to (67:18 - 67:24)
understand (67:22 - 67:24)
um and it's going to be very different (67:24 - 67:28)
you need to pay a lot more attention if (67:26 - 67:30)
you're going to do a dress shirt than if (67:28 - 67:32)
you do with any of their casual things (67:30 - 67:34)
because the Casual cuts are meant to be (67:32 - 67:38)
looser they're meant to be less fitted (67:34 - 67:41)
um if you're going to do a dress shirt (67:38 - 67:45)
long sleeve you absolutely have to (67:41 - 67:49)
pay attention to the size I was I was (67:45 - 67:52)
telling people back when I think joto (67:49 - 67:54)
came out where it kind of where I felt (67:52 - 67:56)
like original Stitch was like really (67:54 - 67:58)
popular around the time they already had (67:56 - 68:00)
all of Kanto and then Johto came out I (67:58 - 68:01)
was just telling people like hey if you (68:00 - 68:04)
want to get a 100 shirt just walk into a (68:01 - 68:05)
Men's Warehouse (68:04 - 68:08)
does it matter male female non-binary (68:05 - 68:10)
just walk into a Men's Warehouse they're (68:08 - 68:12)
in like every single mall and just say (68:10 - 68:13)
hey can I get measurements they'll do (68:12 - 68:14)
your neck they'll do your shoulders (68:13 - 68:16)
they'll do your arm link you write them (68:14 - 68:18)
down and you walk out like they do that (68:16 - 68:20)
stuff for free yeah unless some reason (68:18 - 68:22)
Men's Warehouse recently changed but (68:20 - 68:24)
they I've never had a situation where (68:22 - 68:25)
they're not like do you need free (68:24 - 68:28)
measurements like yeah cool yeah you can (68:25 - 68:32)
do that most department stores that sell (68:28 - 68:34)
business clothes will also do that for (68:32 - 68:37)
you for free the issue that I think (68:34 - 68:41)
people are facing right now is (68:37 - 68:41)
due to covid they feel that they don't (68:41 - 68:47)
have to hire full staff anymore so you (68:45 - 68:50)
may not be able to find (68:47 - 68:54)
people in those sections uh who are able (68:50 - 68:55)
to do it and that also goes for Men's (68:54 - 68:58)
Warehouse there sometimes are now only (68:55 - 68:59)
one person who's trying to work the (68:58 - 69:03)
entire store and they may not have (68:59 - 69:05)
time (69:03 - 69:09)
to do it right then and there but like (69:05 - 69:09)
you can go get yourself message you can (69:10 - 69:13)
also do it yourself there are handy (69:11 - 69:15)
things to do it that are very cheap I (69:13 - 69:17)
have this wonderful device (69:15 - 69:20)
that forms a loop (69:17 - 69:22)
and then you just hit a button and it (69:20 - 69:23)
tightens up and it'll give you a (69:22 - 69:25)
measurement like you can buy them (69:23 - 69:27)
through Amazon yourself they're cheap (69:25 - 69:30)
this cost me like six bucks and then as (69:27 - 69:33)
I change size and shape I have a thing (69:30 - 69:36)
that allows me to measure (69:33 - 69:36)
I'm closing down I believe there are (69:39 - 69:45)
Japanese based company (69:41 - 69:47)
um (69:45 - 69:48)
you would think the Partnerships with (69:47 - 69:52)
Pokemon are one piece or whatever maybe (69:48 - 69:53)
they couldn't get any more after that I (69:52 - 69:55)
don't know but also you just started (69:53 - 69:59)
remaking all of their Kanto designs yeah (69:56 - 70:01)
so I was just kind of expecting this to (69:59 - 70:04)
keep going right yeah I kind of expected (70:01 - 70:05)
the (70:04 - 70:07)
there while they're obviously I (70:05 - 70:09)
shouldn't say Obviously but it's it's (70:07 - 70:10)
too (70:09 - 70:12)
to assume that they're not making as (70:10 - 70:14)
much money off the Pokemon shirts (70:12 - 70:16)
because Pokemon company wants their cut (70:14 - 70:19)
but also like (70:16 - 70:23)
you are making high quality shirts that (70:19 - 70:25)
people will buy and hopefully keep for (70:23 - 70:27)
the rest of their lives so they probably (70:25 - 70:31)
don't have to keep buying more white or (70:27 - 70:33)
black dress shirts because they buy like (70:31 - 70:35)
three of them and they'll never have to (70:33 - 70:38)
ideally never have to buy another one so (70:35 - 70:40)
I don't know maybe they (70:38 - 70:43)
ran into their own problem of like (70:40 - 70:45)
selling their customers really nice (70:43 - 70:47)
stuff and then the customers are like I (70:45 - 70:49)
don't yeah I don't need any more I if I (70:47 - 70:51)
had a thousand dollars to spend on (70:49 - 70:53)
business clothes I would spend so much (70:51 - 70:55)
so much of it at original stitch on (70:53 - 70:58)
these Pokemon shirts (70:55 - 71:02)
yeah but I I have a couple and (70:58 - 71:06)
they're super nice I mean I I both of (71:02 - 71:07)
mine I love (71:06 - 71:08)
um (71:07 - 71:10)
I love mine even though it doesn't fit (71:08 - 71:12)
right yeah I still got to customize it (71:10 - 71:14)
so it looks super cool (71:12 - 71:17)
yeah and you can like even if you can't (71:14 - 71:18)
button it you can still wear it like you (71:17 - 71:20)
can put a t-shirt underneath and wear it (71:18 - 71:21)
over the top like there's layering (71:20 - 71:24)
options they're still usable but (71:21 - 71:25)
um (71:24 - 71:29)
you just sort of need to pay attention (71:25 - 71:31)
to a lot of things I you know I have my (71:29 - 71:33)
Roselia shirt that I bought when I was a (71:31 - 71:35)
larger size that you know I'm fine with (71:33 - 71:37)
it I bought the rosary shirt that I (71:35 - 71:39)
bought at my smaller size (71:37 - 71:40)
um but I love both of them they both fit (71:39 - 71:41)
well (71:40 - 71:44)
um again I think it the tough thing is (71:41 - 71:47)
they were really hoping and banking on (71:44 - 71:49)
people liking the quality of their (71:47 - 71:51)
shirts that they would swap over and get (71:49 - 71:54)
more of their other dress shirts (71:51 - 71:56)
and I I just don't know that that (71:54 - 71:59)
crossover ever really happened in the (71:56 - 72:02)
volume that they needed plus it like the (71:59 - 72:03)
shirts if you look at the website the (72:02 - 72:05)
shirts we're getting more expensive they (72:03 - 72:08)
went from 100 now they're 120 dollars (72:05 - 72:10)
um and that's before shipping and (72:08 - 72:12)
everything else (72:10 - 72:14)
um so I think like (72:12 - 72:16)
as things get more expensive and it gets (72:14 - 72:20)
harder to just get things out that (72:16 - 72:24)
the product they'll price themselves out (72:20 - 72:26)
of being able to have a customer base so (72:24 - 72:27)
they're most likely just shutting it (72:26 - 72:29)
down (72:27 - 72:31)
and saying you know we see the direction (72:29 - 72:33)
of where things are going and that's (72:31 - 72:35)
just not sustainable (72:33 - 72:37)
maybe in the next two weeks the Pokemon (72:35 - 72:39)
company will will buy them out and (72:37 - 72:41)
continue (72:39 - 72:41)
factories (72:41 - 72:44)
yeah I do hope that the designs kind of (72:45 - 72:49)
carry over somewhere because they're (72:47 - 72:51)
really really good designs that aren't (72:49 - 72:53)
just the Pokemon being slapped onto the (72:51 - 72:58)
shirt yeah well I love all the designs (72:53 - 72:58)
I mean (72:59 - 73:04)
I want to know like who they were using (73:01 - 73:06)
to make these designs because they're (73:04 - 73:08)
all original designs of theirs so they (73:06 - 73:11)
had to have like a number of artists (73:08 - 73:14)
that they were using either in-house or (73:11 - 73:18)
Contracting to to make these designs (73:14 - 73:18)
and that in and of itself like (73:19 - 73:25)
getting fabric made with a very specific (73:22 - 73:29)
print is a very big upfront expense that (73:25 - 73:32)
you are trusting people will (73:29 - 73:35)
pay for later (73:32 - 73:35)
well the Kanto ones all sold out yep and (73:36 - 73:42)
then the Johto ones mostly sold out (73:40 - 73:44)
I (73:42 - 73:46)
I know there were hoens ones I mean we (73:44 - 73:49)
made it all the way to Sinnoh yeah and (73:46 - 73:54)
so uh once again Unova fans screwed up (73:49 - 73:57)
I mean I'm crushed that I'll never get a (73:54 - 74:01)
Max caliber shirt or a tinkerton shirt (73:57 - 74:01)
thank goodness for the zaroon movie (74:02 - 74:06)
otherwise we would never got that cram (74:04 - 74:07)
shirt (74:06 - 74:10)
it's true (74:07 - 74:10)
um let's get through not a lot to say (74:11 - 74:15)
here just some bullet points uh Umbreon (74:13 - 74:20)
is now available in Pokemon unite yep uh (74:15 - 74:22)
has um (74:20 - 74:24)
the ability inner focus when Umbreon (74:22 - 74:27)
would be shoved thrown or left unable to (74:24 - 74:29)
attack the effect is negated for a short (74:27 - 74:31)
time Umbreon also becomes immune to (74:29 - 74:34)
hinderances and its defense and special (74:31 - 74:36)
defense are increased this ability goes (74:34 - 74:38)
on a cooldown (74:36 - 74:40)
um as an Evie it knows Swift and fake (74:38 - 74:43)
tears it can get mean look Foul Play (74:40 - 74:47)
Wish snarl it's a unite move Moonlight (74:43 - 74:50)
prance it will continue to recover HP (74:47 - 74:53)
when not in combat it will leap up and (74:50 - 74:55)
absorb the shields of opposing Pokemon (74:53 - 74:58)
taking it for itself it will land and (74:55 - 75:02)
deal damage to uh Pokemon in the area (74:58 - 75:04)
for a short time when the opposing (75:02 - 75:05)
Pokemon (75:04 - 75:08)
uh in the area of effect is granted a (75:05 - 75:10)
shield Umbreon wolves you just said this (75:08 - 75:12)
Pokemon you repeated it you steal the (75:10 - 75:13)
shields we get it (75:12 - 75:15)
yeah it's (75:13 - 75:17)
it is (75:15 - 75:19)
so good to steal the shields of (75:17 - 75:20)
Blastoise (75:19 - 75:23)
because Blastoise unite move gives it (75:20 - 75:25)
this huge shield and then you let that (75:23 - 75:26)
happen and the number and jumps in and (75:25 - 75:29)
Yanks it away and you're like yes (75:26 - 75:31)
yes this is it does say here strong (75:29 - 75:34)
against Blastoise yeah against Mew yeah (75:31 - 75:38)
uh one of the interesting things is (75:34 - 75:39)
I think people didn't expect that it's (75:38 - 75:41)
inner Focus (75:39 - 75:45)
ability is a bit like it gets a built-in (75:41 - 75:46)
score Shield (75:45 - 75:49)
so if that bubble is up and you're (75:46 - 75:51)
scoring and something comes to interrupt (75:49 - 75:54)
you it has to break that Shield (75:51 - 75:57)
first before it can interrupt your (75:54 - 75:59)
scoring so I think what people are (75:57 - 76:03)
beating to be surprised by Umbreon is (75:59 - 76:06)
if it's scoring it takes a bit for it to (76:03 - 76:07)
be interrupted (76:06 - 76:10)
um which is making uh the stacking items (76:07 - 76:12)
really good on Umbreon (76:10 - 76:12)
um (76:12 - 76:15)
here to say um brand is not overpowered (76:12 - 76:17)
there's nothing about it that has seemed (76:15 - 76:19)
to have broken the games (76:17 - 76:21)
um it's probably maybe a little (76:19 - 76:24)
underpowered compared to like where (76:21 - 76:27)
Lapras came in but it is still a very (76:24 - 76:30)
solid choice and they're running the EV (76:27 - 76:33)
only (76:30 - 76:36)
map right now (76:33 - 76:38)
um which has a weird (76:36 - 76:41)
mechanic of where you just stop and do (76:38 - 76:44)
an appeal move which is just you running (76:41 - 76:47)
around generating hearts and if your (76:44 - 76:50)
side does more appeals you get to score (76:47 - 76:52)
faster so you have to like balance (76:50 - 76:54)
between stopping and doing nothing and (76:52 - 76:56)
just running around giving off Hearts as (76:54 - 76:57)
things are coming to try to kill you (76:56 - 77:00)
it's a fun map (76:57 - 77:02)
um it's a nice little addition to just (77:00 - 77:05)
change up the gameplay uh while we wait (77:02 - 77:07)
for Leafeon to come in (77:05 - 77:10)
yeah Leafeon should be less than two (77:07 - 77:13)
weeks you have this recording (77:10 - 77:16)
um and then everyone's ever so we have (77:13 - 77:18)
Umbreon we have Leafeon and then (77:16 - 77:20)
intellion everyone else's favorite Eevee (77:18 - 77:25)
makes sense I'll end in eon (77:20 - 77:27)
actually I don't think I don't know how (77:25 - 77:28)
to spell Italian actually (77:27 - 77:31)
um it is eon (77:28 - 77:31)
soft Pokey Beach obsidian obsidian (77:33 - 77:40)
Flames officially revealed (77:36 - 77:43)
which is the next set which is (77:40 - 77:46)
uh boy they love pumping these out so uh (77:43 - 77:51)
paldea evolved which is the current set (77:46 - 77:53)
um (77:51 - 77:55)
I believe that a set officially releases (77:53 - 77:59)
on June 9th uh but if you've gone to (77:55 - 78:01)
like a pre-release or one of those build (77:59 - 78:03)
and battle boxes I think those events (78:01 - 78:04)
have already started so you should be (78:03 - 78:07)
seeing cards out there in the wild (78:04 - 78:09)
um obsidian Flames will come out on (78:07 - 78:13)
August 11th which I think is the week (78:09 - 78:16)
after worlds nope it is the week of (78:13 - 78:18)
world (78:16 - 78:24)
uh this set will include Charizard EX (78:18 - 78:28)
Darkness type Tyranitar ex lightning (78:24 - 78:29)
type (78:28 - 78:34)
uh Ice Cube ex vespaquen ex (78:29 - 78:34)
these type-shifted Terra Pokemon EX will (78:34 - 78:39)
still use the same energy as their (78:38 - 78:41)
regular types but we'll have a different (78:39 - 78:43)
weakness corresponding to their shifted (78:41 - 78:47)
types for example Charizard EX will be a (78:43 - 78:48)
Darkness card (78:47 - 78:50)
fun fact it's not called Dark type it's (78:48 - 78:53)
called Darkness type in the TCG with (78:50 - 78:56)
fire attack costs and a grass type (78:53 - 78:59)
weakness Darkness our week to grasp (78:56 - 79:02)
because grass in the game represents bug (78:59 - 79:05)
we cannot go down this rabbit hole if (79:02 - 79:07)
you don't understand the the type (79:05 - 79:09)
weakness stuff in the TCG makes sense if (79:07 - 79:11)
you play it if you don't play it you're (79:09 - 79:13)
like why is this week to the it all (79:11 - 79:15)
makes sense I promise you after the (79:13 - 79:17)
disaster that was Dragon type and fairy (79:15 - 79:20)
type both (79:17 - 79:24)
this is better I promise you (79:20 - 79:25)
um (79:24 - 79:28)
I have a question (79:25 - 79:31)
about (79:28 - 79:31)
these EX cards okay because I'm looking (79:31 - 79:37)
at Pokey Beach and like Tyranitar ex (79:35 - 79:39)
suddenly uses (79:37 - 79:42)
electric energy (79:39 - 79:42)
no that was the old the old one (79:43 - 79:46)
so the ones they're showing there so so (79:46 - 79:52)
on Pokey Beach they're showing they're (79:49 - 79:55)
showing a Dark Charizard and a electric (79:52 - 79:58)
Tyranitar so people are saying that (79:55 - 80:01)
those were Delta cards okay that came (79:58 - 80:03)
out like 15 years ago or whatever (80:01 - 80:05)
they're saying that these two new cards (80:03 - 80:10)
the are are to represent the old Delta (80:05 - 80:13)
cards they're like an homage (80:10 - 80:18)
homage yes so (80:13 - 80:18)
that they'll have a different weakness (80:18 - 80:23)
but we'll still use like fire energy to (80:20 - 80:24)
power their moves is that what they're (80:23 - 80:26)
assuming the ex thing (80:24 - 80:28)
the Tara type is gonna do (80:26 - 80:31)
yeah so Charizard will still use fire (80:28 - 80:34)
energy but it will be the darkness (80:31 - 80:35)
Terror type (80:34 - 80:38)
uh and this is this the set that has the (80:35 - 80:40)
the Charmander that everybody's going (80:38 - 80:43)
crazy for on the internet yeah (80:40 - 80:47)
yes this is the set with the very angry (80:43 - 80:49)
Charmander wanting to eat the Pidgey (80:47 - 80:52)
it's a very good car this reminds me of (80:49 - 80:54)
my childhood cat who used to do this (80:52 - 80:57)
exact same thing (80:54 - 80:59)
without the fire (80:57 - 81:02)
without being a lizard uh so obsidian (80:59 - 81:06)
Flames will have 190 cards 15 Ex six (81:02 - 81:10)
Terra ex 12 illustration rares (81:06 - 81:12)
six special illustration rares and (81:10 - 81:16)
supporter 12 ultra rare full art etched (81:12 - 81:19)
cards and supporters 15 trainers and (81:16 - 81:23)
three hyper rare gold etch cards (81:19 - 81:27)
the elite trainer boxes will feature the (81:23 - 81:30)
Charmander card so it shouldn't be like (81:27 - 81:32)
a really hard card to get it's just (81:30 - 81:34)
coming in etbs and then the Pokemon (81:32 - 81:38)
Center version will have the extra (81:34 - 81:40)
stamped version (81:38 - 81:43)
uh move the bonus bonus card that you (81:40 - 81:45)
get from Pokemon Center (81:43 - 81:47)
um so those are actually available for (81:45 - 81:49)
pre-order on Pokemon Center as of this (81:47 - 81:53)
recording I don't think they're sold out (81:49 - 81:53)
um but I also don't think we've (81:53 - 81:58)
gotten a U.S announcement for the 151 (81:55 - 82:02)
set that is supposed to come out to (81:58 - 82:02)
um but that they're showing more of that (82:03 - 82:05)
in Japan (82:04 - 82:07)
but I guess we'll talk about that when (82:05 - 82:10)
the US gets closer to getting that bonus (82:07 - 82:12)
set (82:10 - 82:12)
uh (82:14 - 82:17)
uh I did not copy and paste this in the (82:19 - 82:24)
show notes but uh there is a update (82:21 - 82:26)
coming to Masters yeah I need to put in (82:24 - 82:27)
the show notes because Greg will tell (82:26 - 82:31)
you about what's coming to Masters uh (82:27 - 82:35)
there's a time space Distortion and (82:31 - 82:37)
trainers from the Hisui region are (82:35 - 82:40)
mystically appearing on Piezo so I get (82:37 - 82:42)
to I get to smooch the historical (82:40 - 82:45)
hotties and I'm very excited about it (82:42 - 82:48)
did they say which characters no they (82:45 - 82:49)
haven't said they just said they just (82:48 - 82:52)
showed Don and (82:49 - 82:54)
oh what is his name (82:52 - 82:58)
all the I'll admit admin no they showed (82:54 - 83:01)
Don and who's the male protagonist from (82:58 - 83:04)
Cinema (83:01 - 83:04)
[Laughter] (83:11 - 83:17)
what is his name Donna (83:14 - 83:24)
shoot Derek Dustin no no no no no Lucas (83:17 - 83:24)
Lucas (83:25 - 83:30)
they have different names and legends (83:28 - 83:31)
though (83:30 - 83:32)
yeah (83:31 - 83:37)
ikari and some yeah but in in in the (83:32 - 83:39)
trailer they show Don and Lucas from (83:37 - 83:42)
present day Sinnoh being all shocked at (83:39 - 83:45)
this giant warp bubble is forming and (83:42 - 83:47)
this is pretty much (83:45 - 83:50)
the admin and what's the other girl's (83:47 - 83:52)
name uh (83:50 - 83:56)
uh urea irada (83:52 - 83:56)
it has to be those two yeah it's (83:56 - 84:02)
probably those two the good thing would (83:59 - 84:03)
be (84:02 - 84:05)
um what's his name (84:03 - 84:08)
no inga's already in the game so I doubt (84:05 - 84:11)
that they would do yeah (84:08 - 84:14)
I want I want busted up (84:11 - 84:17)
Ingo in the game to have all the (84:14 - 84:18)
interactions with the other characters (84:17 - 84:21)
so we can see his brother again probably (84:18 - 84:24)
do a Sinnoh suit or a special suit (84:21 - 84:27)
busted up Ingo right that would be that (84:24 - 84:29)
would probably be the best that comes (84:27 - 84:30)
out of that oh you were probably gonna (84:29 - 84:31)
say (84:30 - 84:37)
Volvo right yeah not the car (84:31 - 84:39)
they're putting a whole sedan in the (84:37 - 84:41)
game yeah they're gonna race they're (84:39 - 84:43)
really branching out with the with the (84:41 - 84:44)
extra (84:43 - 84:46)
um (84:44 - 84:48)
I really saw all the car building and (84:46 - 84:52)
yeah these are Brands we need vehicles (84:48 - 84:53)
in our game too (84:52 - 84:55)
uh so most likely it's gonna be out of (84:53 - 84:59)
an area and it might be (84:55 - 85:01)
Volo the thing is is that this also (84:59 - 85:04)
feels like gem bait given that we are (85:01 - 85:07)
coming up on the anniversary so this (85:04 - 85:12)
could be their gem bait pre-anniversary (85:07 - 85:14)
big release because we do not know what (85:12 - 85:16)
they're doing for the anniversary yet (85:14 - 85:19)
they have it if they do Volo is it not (85:16 - 85:22)
Giratina or is Guillotine already (85:19 - 85:27)
Giratina is in the game with (85:22 - 85:31)
uh uh Cigna suit Cynthia (85:27 - 85:34)
oh really there's a Giratina and Cynthia (85:31 - 85:37)
Cynthia (85:34 - 85:41)
over a year ago a while ago (85:37 - 85:43)
I must have missed it I logged in for (85:41 - 85:47)
that one yeah it's really good (85:43 - 85:49)
um I mean technically there are two (85:47 - 85:50)
giratinas (85:49 - 85:52)
oh yeah I mean technically there's (85:50 - 85:53)
there's (85:52 - 85:57)
the feet are the legs there are two (85:53 - 86:01)
levels in the game I think no maybe yeah (85:57 - 86:04)
and Monty has a Ho-Oh (86:01 - 86:06)
but one of them's shining right yeah (86:04 - 86:08)
Monty's is shiny (86:06 - 86:10)
but still like they are not limiting (86:08 - 86:13)
they're limiting the amount of ho-hos so (86:10 - 86:14)
they're not gonna limit the amount of (86:13 - 86:17)
that ship has sailed (86:14 - 86:19)
I mean ever since ago it's been nothing (86:17 - 86:21)
but hoes (86:19 - 86:24)
um yeah just look up Cigna Cynthia uh I (86:21 - 86:28)
think it's it's spooky they call it (86:24 - 86:30)
spooky (86:28 - 86:30)
it's I don't think it's that it (86:30 - 86:37)
mysterious I remember okay so I'm seeing (86:33 - 86:39)
I'm seeing her with uh Como oh I (86:37 - 86:41)
remember that one there's the Como one (86:39 - 86:43)
and then there is the Renegade (86:41 - 86:46)
yep that's it (86:43 - 86:49)
yeah which is it's a great outfit (86:46 - 86:52)
I don't have this pair and they're (86:49 - 86:53)
running it right now it's funny because (86:52 - 86:55)
as they're announcing the hasuian ones (86:53 - 86:58)
they brought back the ability to get (86:55 - 87:00)
this outfit from Cynthia so this is a (86:58 - 87:02)
banner right now you can get the (87:00 - 87:05)
Renegade form (87:02 - 87:05)
but well I want to get the top ooze as (87:06 - 87:11)
well I know and the top is really good (87:08 - 87:14)
but I'm saving up my gems I'm not (87:11 - 87:16)
falling for any of this bait right now (87:14 - 87:19)
so much bait because they'll bring the (87:16 - 87:21)
tattoos but they bring them all back so (87:19 - 87:23)
uh (87:21 - 87:23)
uh it's all (87:24 - 87:28)
good (87:27 - 87:32)
uh Masters is is fun (87:28 - 87:35)
uh we got so distracted with the bugs in (87:32 - 87:37)
scarlet and violet uh there is an (87:35 - 87:38)
official release date here for Pokemon (87:37 - 87:40)
home there's not really much to say (87:38 - 87:42)
because they just said here's the date (87:40 - 87:44)
and then they said nothing else they (87:42 - 87:48)
said it could take up to six hours yeah (87:44 - 87:50)
that's true they did say that it's a (87:48 - 87:53)
slow roll out but that's why yeah that's (87:50 - 87:55)
not new to Pokemon home that's the how (87:53 - 87:56)

the 29th until potentially 11 pm on the (88:39 - 88:44)
30th (88:42 - 88:45)
oh so they are giving themselves extra (88:44 - 88:48)
time because I want to say last time (88:45 - 88:51)
for 2.0 they said up to six hours and (88:48 - 88:52)
then it actually took I think eight (88:51 - 88:54)
hours (88:52 - 88:56)
which is whatever I mean like they're (88:54 - 88:58)
updating a server it's fine I don't (88:56 - 89:02)
think we've waited this long right (88:58 - 89:04)
and we know when it is now and we don't (89:02 - 89:06)
know why they said the other dates (89:04 - 89:08)
before but (89:06 - 89:11)
it's happening I guarantee it was the (89:08 - 89:13)
other date and then the then and then (89:11 - 89:15)
the raid bug happened and they went into (89:13 - 89:18)
panic mode and we're like don't release (89:15 - 89:22)
it maybe maybe if it I mean the raid bug (89:18 - 89:24)
is seeming to be bigger than we thought (89:22 - 89:27)
it was yeah (89:24 - 89:27)
I'm sure they ruled out that it was the (89:27 - 89:32)
code they put in for home and were like (89:29 - 89:33)
okay well that's not it so you can go (89:32 - 89:35)
ahead with home we need to work on what (89:33 - 89:36)
it actually is (89:35 - 89:38)
I mean that you don't really update (89:36 - 89:40)
Scarlett and violet for home you update (89:38 - 89:42)
home for home which this actually begs (89:40 - 89:45)
the question is (89:42 - 89:47)
if you don't (89:45 - 89:49)
so Pokemon home is its own update right (89:47 - 89:51)
and the reason that that's obvious is (89:49 - 89:54)
because you don't need to have Scarlet (89:51 - 89:56)
you don't you need to own scarlet and (89:54 - 89:59)
violet for for home to update and for (89:56 - 90:01)
you to use 3.0 right like it's going to (89:59 - 90:04)
update itself there are Pokemon in the (90:01 - 90:06)
game (90:04 - 90:09)
uh that (90:06 - 90:13)
are not available yet the uh obvious one (90:09 - 90:16)
being like hisuian Pokemon (90:13 - 90:16)
um so the question is are all those (90:16 - 90:20)
history and Pokemon going to just work (90:18 - 90:22)
right away (90:20 - 90:24)
or (90:22 - 90:27)
are they not going to work the (90:24 - 90:32)
assumption is that they should just work (90:27 - 90:34)
but just because they worked in pass (90:32 - 90:38)
games doesn't mean (90:34 - 90:38)
it doesn't mean anything nope because (90:39 - 90:44)
they love to remove features or change (90:42 - 90:48)
things or not communicate properly so if (90:44 - 90:50)
if (90:48 - 90:54)
um the home updates after 700 hours of (90:50 - 90:56)
it being down for maintenance you should (90:54 - 90:59)
ideally be able to move over (90:56 - 91:01)
his sui and decidueye his Sue (90:59 - 91:03)
anti-flosion Hisui and samrat (91:01 - 91:06)
you should be able to move over weird (91:03 - 91:12)
deer cleaver ursuluna hisuin leganth (91:06 - 91:12)
should be able to move over his suing (91:14 - 91:20)
basculine and then both basket Legions (91:16 - 91:23)
history and Growlithe suing Arcanine (91:20 - 91:25)
hasuian (91:23 - 91:25)
quill fish I forgot its name and then (91:26 - 91:31)
over quill hasuian Sneasel and then (91:27 - 91:34)
sneezler hasui and Voltorb suian (91:31 - 91:37)
electrode Sween bravery we already have (91:34 - 91:41)
zorark that's that's working (91:37 - 91:46)
and then finally (91:41 - 91:50)
um what is her name uh (91:46 - 91:52)
the the the attorney (91:50 - 91:56)
not eternitus uh why is her name (91:52 - 91:57)
blanking (91:56 - 92:01)
what are you talking about the genie (91:57 - 92:05)
oh and Amorous (92:01 - 92:08)
man I couldn't even remember Lucas can't (92:05 - 92:09)
remember an Amorous is one of those days (92:08 - 92:12)
I mean to be fair Lucas never comes up (92:09 - 92:16)
nobody cares about Lucas uh so okay so (92:12 - 92:18)
those (92:16 - 92:21)
obviously as well all of those base (92:18 - 92:23)
forms are in the game like or so Ursa (92:21 - 92:25)
ring is in the game scyther's in the (92:23 - 92:28)
game you know Growlithe is in the game (92:25 - 92:31)
so (92:28 - 92:31)
I think everyone just assumes they're (92:31 - 92:34)
gonna work (92:33 - 92:37)
they could I I do think there's like a (92:34 - 92:39)
small chance that (92:37 - 92:42)
based on how broken this game is I don't (92:39 - 92:43)
know I don't know what to guess anymore (92:42 - 92:45)
I don't know they should work (92:43 - 92:48)
um on the Galler side you have the (92:45 - 92:49)
starters (92:48 - 92:53)
so ideally you should be able to move (92:49 - 92:55)
groky grooky oh grokey is my favorite (92:53 - 92:58)
Pokemon yeah you should be able to move (92:55 - 92:59)
groupie over or even though that Raid (92:58 - 93:02)
event hasn't happened uh and then you (92:59 - 93:03)
have the (93:02 - 93:05)
slow (93:03 - 93:08)
gallerian slow bro (93:05 - 93:11)
sorry galarian Slowpoke and then well (93:08 - 93:14)
yeah and slow bro and slow King those (93:11 - 93:16)
should work (93:14 - 93:17)
um (93:16 - 93:21)
there are some legendaries from his from (93:17 - 93:23)
Galler I won't go through those for (93:21 - 93:24)
spoiler purposes but there are a couple (93:23 - 93:27)
legendaries that you can move over (93:24 - 93:30)
but that's all up in the air of like can (93:27 - 93:33)
we just move legendaries over (93:30 - 93:38)
I don't know if if we can move (93:33 - 93:40)
no I'm not confirming or denying but if (93:38 - 93:42)
we can move azashian over (93:40 - 93:44)
are we just gonna see four zashians in (93:42 - 93:48)
every six star raid going forward (93:44 - 93:48)
I don't know (93:48 - 93:56)
uh for alola we should be able to move (93:51 - 93:57)
over (93:56 - 93:59)
alolan Raichu (93:57 - 94:02)
alolan meowtha LOL in Persian alolan (93:59 - 94:06)
grimer alolan muck alolan Diglett alolan (94:02 - 94:09)
Doug Trio (94:06 - 94:09)
um (94:09 - 94:11)
I don't think this is much of a spoiler (94:14 - 94:18)
uh they just have carb ink listed here (94:16 - 94:20)
apparently carbick is in the code he's (94:18 - 94:21)
not a legendary he's not a starter so (94:20 - 94:24)
he's not carbank was in the code and (94:21 - 94:26)
then was removed there's something going (94:24 - 94:29)
on with carving and we don't know (94:26 - 94:31)
shenanigans (94:29 - 94:33)
uh (94:31 - 94:38)
for Canto regular Tauros (94:33 - 94:38)
uh (94:38 - 94:42)
uh there are a lot of legendaries listed (94:40 - 94:45)
here that I don't want to go into (94:42 - 94:48)
I don't know if I (94:45 - 94:50)
it's it's always possible for Pokemon to (94:48 - 94:53)
be in the code and not be accessed right (94:50 - 94:56)
we learned this with sword shield (94:53 - 94:58)
I just don't know if they're gonna turn (94:56 - 95:00)
on home on let's just say Tuesday (94:58 - 95:01)
because Monday it's going to be down all (95:00 - 95:03)
day and then all of a sudden we're gonna (95:01 - 95:06)
see four zashians sitting in a raid like (95:03 - 95:08)
maybe (95:06 - 95:08)
I don't know (95:08 - 95:13)
it just did that happen with Sirens (95:10 - 95:14)
Shield they did home and then all of a (95:13 - 95:18)
sudden like kyogres were everywhere (95:14 - 95:21)
I don't (95:18 - 95:21)
like like kyogres came with (95:21 - 95:28)
with the DLC the DLC but I guess maybe (95:25 - 95:32)
Kyogre wasn't the code before that (95:28 - 95:32)
I don't know I'm just I'm just throwing (95:35 - 95:39)
it out there that while these Pokemon (95:37 - 95:42)
are have been currently in the code (95:39 - 95:44)
since day one (95:42 - 95:46)
ideally a lot of these should just work (95:44 - 95:50)
when home updates I wouldn't be (95:46 - 95:52)
surprised if the legendaries themselves (95:50 - 95:53)
don't work (95:52 - 95:56)
but who knows (95:53 - 95:56)
your guess is as good as mine if they (95:58 - 96:02)
work cool if they don't work (96:00 - 96:06)
I'm sure they will eventually work yep (96:02 - 96:06)
uh (96:07 - 96:12)
I think I think the hasuian Pokemon I (96:09 - 96:14)
think like moving Hisui and Goodra over (96:12 - 96:16)
is is more exciting than moving over (96:14 - 96:18)
zashian personally yeah I want to see (96:16 - 96:20)
sneezler (96:18 - 96:24)
running around yes me too (96:20 - 96:24)
um so uh keep your eyes out for that (96:24 - 96:30)
uh we'll we'll (96:27 - 96:34)
see what happens I guess on Tuesday (96:30 - 96:36)
if I was a betting man I would say (96:34 - 96:40)
something else is going to break (96:36 - 96:40)
um (96:43 - 96:45)
uh anyways (96:46 - 96:49)
I think that's our show (96:48 - 96:51)
made it to the end thanks for listening (96:49 - 96:54)
thanks for making to the end (96:51 - 96:56)
um I think tomorrow is today when you're (96:54 - 96:58)
listening to this is Memorial Day I (96:56 - 96:59)
think (96:58 - 97:01)
so some people have off if you work at a (96:59 - 97:04)
bank I think you have off (97:01 - 97:06)
so that's cool (97:04 - 97:08)
but (97:06 - 97:10)
yeah we'll be back next week uh (97:08 - 97:11)

we can talk about some raid events we (97:11 - 97:15)
can talk about Pokemon home (97:13 - 97:17)
