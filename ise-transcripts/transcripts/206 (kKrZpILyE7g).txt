hello everyone and welcome to another (0:55 - 1:01)
episode of the pokemon podcast my name (0:57 - 1:03)
is SBJ I usually say what episode number (1:01 - 1:06)
it is but since the recordings this week (1:03 - 1:08)
have been all over the place I will edit (1:06 - 1:13)
that in to post yeah uh we have Travis (1:08 - 1:17)
with us today hate to derail the show so (1:13 - 1:20)
early but now that Pokemon is 20 years (1:17 - 1:23)
old I feel like I need to get it out (1:20 - 1:26)
like any 20 year old I'm gonna worry I'm (1:23 - 1:28)
worrying that Pokemon is going to get to (1:26 - 1:30)
the phase where it starts caring too (1:28 - 1:32)
much about ultimate frisbee and it (1:30 - 1:34)
starts hanging Reservoir Dogs posters i (1:32 - 1:37)
think as responsible parents Steve you (1:34 - 1:42)
and I need to put a stop to this we'll (1:37 - 1:45)
have to we'll have to have the in bed (1:42 - 1:48)
parent to parent talk to leave yeah (1:45 - 1:51)
about our 20 year old child that we had (1:48 - 1:55)
to look a little weird transition um we (1:51 - 1:58)
also have Allegra back from polygon hi (1:55 - 2:04)
hello you're back so soon I'm so so so (1:58 - 2:07)
back so excited to be back so we are (2:04 - 2:09)
recording this on februari 27th it is (2:07 - 2:12)
the 20th anniversary (2:09 - 2:12)
not a standard episode of course but we (2:13 - 2:19)
will be we wanted to record as soon as (2:17 - 2:21)
we could to talk about the recent (2:19 - 2:24)
pokemon news and the amazingly long six (2:21 - 2:26)
minute Pokemon direct that we were (2:24 - 2:29)
blessed with let's uh yeah let's let's (2:26 - 2:31)
talk about that first so it was at nine (2:29 - 2:35)
a.m. central time seven Pacific and we (2:31 - 2:40)
had a six-minute long nintendo direct or (2:35 - 2:43)
pokemon direct i should say that opened (2:40 - 2:46)
with a little original gameboy teaser (2:43 - 2:50)
and then the CEO of pokemon who i can (2:46 - 2:52)
never say his his name correctly (2:50 - 2:56)
ishihara sounds right to me yeah i can't (2:52 - 2:57)
can't really offer you much help there (2:56 - 3:04)
and we then moved into a trailer talking (2:57 - 3:07)
with a bunch of kids and different (3:04 - 3:09)
countries going back and forth through (3:07 - 3:12)
Game Boys and ds's and Game Boy advances (3:09 - 3:15)
and it really focused on for things and (3:12 - 3:17)
focused on collecting it focused on (3:15 - 3:20)
trading it focused on battling and then (3:17 - 3:23)
it the last one was connecting which I (3:20 - 3:26)
thought was a really important aspect of (3:23 - 3:28)
Pokemon that doesn't actually get talked (3:26 - 3:29)
about a lot you always hear about the (3:28 - 3:31)
color the collecting in the trading in (3:29 - 3:33)
the battling but the the connection (3:31 - 3:35)
thing I think was something that hit (3:33 - 3:37)
home with me a lot actually kind of like (3:35 - 3:40)
gave chills down my spine of like really (3:37 - 3:43)
the first three can't really be possible (3:40 - 3:45)
without the fourth and it's what this (3:43 - 3:47)
show is all about to right I mean that's (3:45 - 3:52)
why we're here so let's stop there and (3:47 - 3:55)
and and talk about that like did you (3:52 - 3:56)
guys like what they were doing up to (3:55 - 3:59)
this point in the in the little direct (3:56 - 4:01)
was was that something that was cool to (3:59 - 4:05)
you to see yeah I definitely was a big (4:01 - 4:09)
fan of that cute little video um I mean (4:05 - 4:11)
just kind of the nature of my work is (4:09 - 4:13)
that I was like had one eye on the (4:11 - 4:16)
direct in another ion like my CMS (4:13 - 4:18)
getting ready to like type up the (4:16 - 4:20)
announcement so like I wasn't totally (4:18 - 4:23)
enjoying it in the purely nostalgic way (4:20 - 4:27)
but um what I did get to see was it (4:23 - 4:28)
I mean it was really cool to like you (4:27 - 4:30)
know have the different like intro (4:28 - 4:34)
screens from different games and just (4:30 - 4:36)
kind of like be reminded of you know (4:34 - 4:38)
seeing these games for the first time (4:36 - 4:42)
it's like that nostalgic overload was (4:38 - 4:44)
really really cool and something I liked (4:42 - 4:46)
was you know there was that super bowl (4:44 - 4:49)
commercial back in them I guess it was (4:46 - 4:51)
earlier this month or whatever right (4:49 - 4:53)
which was kind of going after that same (4:51 - 4:55)
vein of like Pokemon turning 20 let's (4:53 - 4:58)
all be nostalgic and remember how great (4:55 - 5:00)
it is but that like that didn't feel (4:58 - 5:02)
like what pokemon is to me like it (5:00 - 5:03)
didn't really touch on like the major (5:02 - 5:07)
tenets of pokemon but this one (5:03 - 5:10)
definitely felt more familiar and in (5:07 - 5:12)
that sense it was like really exciting (5:10 - 5:14)
is both it used you know the actual (5:12 - 5:17)
games but also just really captured that (5:14 - 5:19)
core feeling of like pokemon is about (5:17 - 5:23)
being a kid and yeah so I thought it did (5:19 - 5:26)
a really good job and it kind of masked (5:23 - 5:27)
the fact that this was like a really (5:26 - 5:29)
really short direct that was totally (5:27 - 5:31)
light on any new information whatsoever (5:29 - 5:35)
I thought so I enjoyed it as well and it (5:31 - 5:38)
Steve I hope i'm not i'm getting ahead (5:35 - 5:42)
too much but i like that the the (5:38 - 5:47)
promotional material for this is in a (5:42 - 5:49)
similar way to how Cala or how x and y (5:47 - 5:52)
were promoted where there is a heavy (5:49 - 5:55)
emphasis on the international aspect of (5:52 - 5:59)
Pokemon when X&Y we're announced and (5:55 - 6:01)
we're coming out there's a lot of things (5:59 - 6:03)
about the different translations that it (6:01 - 6:04)
was going to be in it's cool to see that (6:03 - 6:07)
it's also going to be translated into (6:04 - 6:10)
simplified and traditional Chinese not (6:07 - 6:13)
that I speak other languages but I love (6:10 - 6:17)
that aspect of Pokemon I loved in x and (6:13 - 6:19)
y where there were the different ah (6:17 - 6:22)
vivillon varieties depending on the (6:19 - 6:25)
region you are in and how you had to (6:22 - 6:27)
trade with people all throughout the (6:25 - 6:29)
world to get it so I hope that the fact (6:27 - 6:30)
that they're adding Chinese is a (6:29 - 6:32)
language and they're emphasizing (6:30 - 6:37)
different languages in the direct I hope (6:32 - 6:38)
that that indicates they'll be more (6:37 - 6:40)
stuff like that yeah (6:38 - 6:43)
that will we can move right into the (6:40 - 6:46)
actual announcement that led into what (6:43 - 6:48)
Travis was touching on we got another (6:46 - 6:51)
mini movie Pokemon is always about like (6:48 - 6:54)
these lease like one to two-minute clips (6:51 - 6:57)
of capturing your emotions it started (6:54 - 7:00)
off with of course red and green and (6:57 - 7:02)
they moved on the yellow and then moves (7:00 - 7:03)
throughout the entire games the main (7:02 - 7:07)
game series all the way up to a black (7:03 - 7:09)
screen of 2016 and then we got the (7:07 - 7:11)
official announcement of Pokemon Sun and (7:09 - 7:15)
Pokemon moon which was both it was to me (7:11 - 7:18)
still exciting even though we got the (7:15 - 7:21)
rumors the day before like I was I was (7:18 - 7:24)
like so like oh my god it's like real (7:21 - 7:26)
this is awesome and it might have been (7:24 - 7:29)
like the the emotion and the sigh of (7:26 - 7:31)
like oh god we weren't wrong yesterday (7:29 - 7:35)
but it was also like finally we're (7:31 - 7:38)
getting something this year as a main (7:35 - 7:40)
series game and without really saying it (7:38 - 7:42)
I mean they did go on to say that this (7:40 - 7:47)
is a new adventure which is them saying (7:42 - 7:51)
that this is really generation 7 mm-hmm (7:47 - 7:57)
and we even saw brief shots of what (7:51 - 8:01)
appear to be new Pokemon being modeled (7:57 - 8:04)
on a like the skeleton of a new Pokemon (8:01 - 8:07)
design being modeled in a computer which (8:04 - 8:10)
by the way people are already (8:07 - 8:13)
extrapolating from like the skeleton of (8:10 - 8:16)
that future Pokemon that it's going to (8:13 - 8:18)
be a woodpecker and people are already (8:16 - 8:22)
drawing fan art of it oh wow tumblr (8:18 - 8:26)
moves fast oh my god yeah I saw reddit (8:22 - 8:28)
was already like theorizing so hardcore (8:26 - 8:31)
about like the entirety of the starters (8:28 - 8:33)
are gonna be in this game I'm like yo we (8:31 - 8:37)
know nothing about it calm down please (8:33 - 8:40)
there was one pixel in frame 42 of the (8:37 - 8:44)
direct Jesus but actually for your (8:40 - 8:46)
psychic starter it's it's funny but it's (8:44 - 8:49)
also like well at least they're giving (8:46 - 8:51)
us something to talk about it yeah yeah (8:49 - 8:53)
yeah for real yeah when I (8:51 - 8:55)
I first saw the wire from that Pokemon (8:53 - 8:57)
it looked a lot like a fletching but (8:55 - 8:59)
when you go back and you go through it a (8:57 - 9:00)
couple times because they showed it so (8:59 - 9:03)
fast it's it's clearly a new Pokemon and (9:00 - 9:05)
if it is indeed a woodpecker that would (9:03 - 9:06)
be really exciting because we don't have (9:05 - 9:08)
one of those yet there are still some (9:06 - 9:11)
animals that Pokemon haven't been based (9:08 - 9:16)
off right favorite Lee my apparently my (9:11 - 9:18)
favorite thing on the show to do (9:16 - 9:20)
recently used to make baseless (9:18 - 9:22)
predictions I think I did a lot of that (9:20 - 9:25)
last time I was on the show my new (9:22 - 9:28)
baseless prediction is that this is a (9:25 - 9:31)
woodpecker and that at least it's (9:28 - 9:35)
evolved form is going to have skill link (9:31 - 9:36)
is that the ability that makes it so (9:35 - 9:40)
that um multi-hit moves like rock blasts (9:36 - 9:42)
and stuff it right yeah full number of (9:40 - 9:44)
times it's going to have that because (9:42 - 9:48)
woodpeckers like a chicken pecking like (9:44 - 9:51)
groups of four what have you that's my (9:48 - 9:52)
prediction right now if in the future (9:51 - 9:54)
I'm right I don't know someone that was (9:52 - 10:00)
me a dollar there was also so we also (9:54 - 10:02)
saw some we didn't see any gameplay (10:00 - 10:04)
footage which was actually disappointing (10:02 - 10:07)
did you expect gameplay footage I (10:04 - 10:10)
expected like well I remember when they (10:07 - 10:13)
announced um was it'll make a ruby alpha (10:10 - 10:15)
sapphire they didn't show the actual (10:13 - 10:17)
game but they gave us like they gave us (10:15 - 10:19)
kyogre coming on the water and they gave (10:17 - 10:20)
us grout on they gave us like 20 seconds (10:19 - 10:22)
of footage and it was like oh cool like (10:20 - 10:24)
it looks like we're still on the X&Y (10:22 - 10:27)
engine or mmm like yeah this is still (10:24 - 10:30)
exciting I think it was more (10:27 - 10:33)
disappointing in the aspect of oh we (10:30 - 10:35)
already like knew the names yeah (10:33 - 10:38)
definitely the last announcement kind of (10:35 - 10:39)
made up for that and we'll get to that (10:38 - 10:42)
in a second but I wanted to go back to (10:39 - 10:45)
the trailer and the weird thing that (10:42 - 10:46)
stood out that everyone kind of grabbed (10:45 - 10:49)
onto is there was a lot of illustrations (10:46 - 10:52)
and designs for cars and trucks mm-hmm (10:49 - 10:56)
and there was a what looked like a fire (10:52 - 10:58)
truck except Blastoise was standing at (10:56 - 11:01)
the top instead of water cannon being up (10:58 - 11:04)
there so I don't know if in the Pokemon (11:01 - 11:07)
world Shh they just use Blastoise which (11:04 - 11:09)
kind of my sense and kind of leaf if (11:07 - 11:11)
moving companies are just groups of (11:09 - 11:15)
machak as evidenced by the opening of (11:11 - 11:17)
Ruby and Sapphire then and I think (11:15 - 11:21)
anything is possible they work these (11:17 - 11:23)
Pokemon hard guys this is money (11:21 - 11:27)
just to yeah uh yeah but that was (11:23 - 11:29)
interesting we and and from the base off (11:27 - 11:32)
the other screenshots we got what looked (11:29 - 11:36)
to be more of a summer / tropical area (11:32 - 11:39)
now that's not to say that you know in (11:36 - 11:42)
something like ruby and sapphire there's (11:39 - 11:45)
not like a snowy mountain on top that (11:42 - 11:48)
separates from everything I think black (11:45 - 11:49)
and white had something like that too (11:48 - 11:51)
but people were already going oh it (11:49 - 11:54)
could possibly be in Hawaii or maybe (11:51 - 11:57)
this is actually Spain which we were (11:54 - 11:59)
talking about a little bit on episodes (11:57 - 12:01)
before but we saw what maybe look like a (11:59 - 12:04)
Pokemon school or a Pokemon gym with a (12:01 - 12:08)
horsey statue in front and we had all (12:04 - 12:12)
our are all our pokémon cars that maybe (12:08 - 12:15)
we will drive if not there was the taxi (12:12 - 12:16)
service in x and y that was actually (12:15 - 12:19)
kind of cool no game a gameplay footage (12:16 - 12:20)
but it was cool to see those (12:19 - 12:22)
illustrations something cool about that (12:20 - 12:25)
is like which kind of leads into the (12:22 - 12:27)
other answer that you're either you want (12:25 - 12:29)
to talk about um is that these are all (12:27 - 12:32)
gen one pokemon being featured in this (12:29 - 12:34)
in this new game so I'm kind of (12:32 - 12:36)
interested to see how you know the canto (12:34 - 12:39)
region could factor in like if there's (12:36 - 12:42)
some relationship between oh that Jen (12:39 - 12:45)
and this one especially with the (12:42 - 12:47)
announcement I I'm gonna spoil it here (12:45 - 12:50)
guys I'm gonna make it but um so Pokemon (12:47 - 12:53)
bank which is the 3ds app that lets you (12:50 - 12:56)
transfer your Pokemon between games it's (12:53 - 12:57)
going to interact with the virtual (12:56 - 13:01)
console releases of red blue and yellow (12:57 - 13:04)
which I guess are actually out today so (13:01 - 13:06)
you can transfer your Pokemon into that (13:04 - 13:08)
app which is cool so it makes it easier (13:06 - 13:09)
to transfer between you know the (13:08 - 13:12)
different virtual console releases but (13:09 - 13:13)
then it also will allow you to download (13:12 - 13:16)
those gen one Pokemon into sun and moon (13:13 - 13:19)
so we know that gen 1 poco (13:16 - 13:21)
will factor into sun and moon because of (13:19 - 13:22)
that but then all the things you're (13:21 - 13:25)
pointing out speak to me or tell me that (13:22 - 13:27)
like there's going to be some greater (13:25 - 13:30)
connection to the original generation (13:27 - 13:32)
which is kind of interesting I think I (13:30 - 13:35)
hadn't really thought about that but it (13:32 - 13:38)
makes sense for them to do it when it's (13:35 - 13:41)
it when you're talking about a game (13:38 - 13:43)
announced on a 20th anniversary and (13:41 - 13:48)
they're really pushing the sort of (13:43 - 13:50)
different generations of players aspect (13:48 - 13:53)
in the and the marketing and that I (13:50 - 13:55)
don't know I think that makes sense with (13:53 - 13:57)
the general direction that that they've (13:55 - 13:58)
been going that would be interesting to (13:57 - 14:02)
see yeah this there was also sorry to (13:58 - 14:05)
interrupt but there's this also this 3ds (14:02 - 14:09)
leak on some forums of like the (14:05 - 14:11)
different games that are coming out this (14:09 - 14:13)
year thanks I don't know if you guys saw (14:11 - 14:16)
this post but some guy who has a source (14:13 - 14:18)
of Nintendo leaked like the whole dad (14:16 - 14:21)
works in the day some guy who's uncle's (14:18 - 14:23)
best friend's cousin works at Nintendo (14:21 - 14:27)
gave him like 3ds lineup of like games (14:23 - 14:29)
coming up is here and one of them was (14:27 - 14:32)
called the pokemon 20th anniversary game (14:29 - 14:36)
code name EG which you know we just got (14:32 - 14:38)
these games announced which aren't (14:36 - 14:40)
called niji but apparently like on the (14:38 - 14:42)
assets that were released for the logos (14:40 - 14:45)
the file names were called me g oh wow (14:42 - 14:48)
so that you know kind of points the fact (14:45 - 14:50)
that these are those 20th anniversary (14:48 - 14:52)
games which it makes sense because they (14:50 - 14:53)
are coming out during the 20th (14:52 - 14:55)
anniversary but i definitely think (14:53 - 14:57)
there's going to be some strong angle (14:55 - 15:00)
there mm-hmm there there's two points i (14:57 - 15:03)
want to touch on for the red red yellow (15:00 - 15:06)
blue releases that i think we're that (15:03 - 15:08)
are kind of important the first one (15:06 - 15:10)
being that when you transfer these (15:08 - 15:12)
pokemon from your virtual console games (15:10 - 15:15)
into pokemon bank they can only interact (15:12 - 15:18)
with Pokemon Sun and Pokemon moon they (15:15 - 15:21)
didn't say that during the six minute (15:18 - 15:24)
trailer obviously they were very they (15:21 - 15:26)
were on a strict six minute schedule but (15:24 - 15:28)
if you go to poke my calm it does say (15:26 - 15:31)
that these won't work with XY or Omega (15:28 - 15:33)
Ruby alpha sapphire so I'm assuming (15:31 - 15:35)
that in Sun and Moon there will probably (15:33 - 15:38)
be some not mini game but there were (15:35 - 15:39)
many games in the past to get pokemon (15:38 - 15:41)
from other generations the two-year game (15:39 - 15:43)
but i wonder if there's going to be (15:41 - 15:46)
almost like a facility or something to (15:43 - 15:49)
help randomly generate those abilities (15:46 - 15:53)
and those stat that's the stat breakups (15:49 - 15:57)
that the that word would have been the (15:53 - 16:00)
wall from mm-hmm generation 1 2 now (15:57 - 16:04)
generation 7 the second thing i want to (16:00 - 16:08)
touch on is how that I've been very (16:04 - 16:10)
vocal on the show of how I thought (16:08 - 16:12)
Pokemon bank was very very important to (16:10 - 16:16)
the first generation games more so that (16:12 - 16:19)
Pokemon has always made a big deal of (16:16 - 16:21)
well generation 1 and 2 kind of got (16:19 - 16:24)
stuck and kind of got left behind when (16:21 - 16:25)
we moved to generation 3 because of the (16:24 - 16:28)
hardware and it was so weird to me that (16:25 - 16:29)
they like they've always come back and (16:28 - 16:32)
said like we're sorry we weren't able to (16:29 - 16:34)
do this and then they would go hey we're (16:32 - 16:36)
going to release these virtual console (16:34 - 16:38)
games and you know that thing we kept (16:36 - 16:40)
complaining about before well you know (16:38 - 16:41)
these games aren't going to connect (16:40 - 16:44)
either so it was very exciting that they (16:41 - 16:47)
did connect it and actually I'm ok with (16:44 - 16:49)
them keeping that a surprise because at (16:47 - 16:50)
the time when they announced it and they (16:49 - 16:52)
didn't say anything about working with (16:50 - 16:54)
Pokemon bank and I got a lot of I got a (16:52 - 16:56)
lot of heat for that being like oh well (16:54 - 16:58)
the abilities in the special attack and (16:56 - 16:59)
physical attack for this too complicated (16:58 - 17:03)
they can't do it the technology just (16:59 - 17:07)
isn't there there was stat XP then we (17:03 - 17:13)
have v's now I am so glad that they did (17:07 - 17:15)
that and I think it's it's important to (17:13 - 17:19)
people to you know put time in and they (17:15 - 17:21)
it a way it changed my mind from not (17:19 - 17:23)
wanting by these games because I don't (17:21 - 17:25)
like to play pokemon games that I can't (17:23 - 17:26)
carry pokemon with me from generation to (17:25 - 17:28)
generation went from me not wanting to (17:26 - 17:30)
buy these to not wanting to buy all (17:28 - 17:32)
three I also think it's very important (17:30 - 17:35)
for people who are there are so many (17:32 - 17:37)
people who just love generation one I (17:35 - 17:39)
know the verge just put up an article (17:37 - 17:41)
today about Pokemon it was an article (17:39 - 17:44)
referring to i apologize i don't know (17:41 - 17:46)
the author but he put his top ten (17:44 - 17:47)
pokemon and i look (17:46 - 17:49)
that and I was like oh my gosh these are (17:47 - 17:51)
all generation one pokemon like this is (17:49 - 17:53)
not the top 10 list I like because I (17:51 - 17:56)
like seeing the range from generation 16 (17:53 - 17:58)
but if you just look at the comments (17:56 - 18:00)
alone you just see how many people just (17:58 - 18:03)
love Charizard or love Bulbasaur it's so (18:00 - 18:05)
many people who love generation one and (18:03 - 18:08)
if you want to bring those people from (18:05 - 18:10)
if you want to fast-track those people (18:08 - 18:12)
to generation one to generation seven (18:10 - 18:15)
there's no like better way for teasing (18:12 - 18:17)
like hey you know that pokemon copy (18:15 - 18:19)
already bought for ten dollars you know (18:17 - 18:21)
that Charizard that you loved well now (18:19 - 18:23)
if you buy Pokemon Sun and Moon we can (18:21 - 18:26)
bring that Charizard with you and I (18:23 - 18:28)
think that's a very good and important (18:26 - 18:31)
way to bring those generation players (18:28 - 18:35)
into the new series which is obviously (18:31 - 18:37)
something they want to do to play the (18:35 - 18:41)
cynic for a little bit do you think that (18:37 - 18:46)
it's truly the case that there would (18:41 - 18:50)
have been no way for them to have the (18:46 - 18:53)
Virtual Console Pokemon transfer to you (18:50 - 18:55)
x and y or a mega ruby and alpha (18:53 - 18:57)
sapphire and that that's why it's only (18:55 - 18:59)
sun and moon or do you think and this is (18:57 - 19:01)
question for both of you or do you think (18:59 - 19:04)
that sorry i'm losing my train of (19:01 - 19:07)
thought what are you good or do you (19:04 - 19:12)
think that it's more of a move to sell (19:07 - 19:14)
units because that way they actually (19:12 - 19:16)
have to get the new game as opposed to (19:14 - 19:19)
just uploading it to their little (19:16 - 19:21)
cousins copy of alpha sapphire I (19:19 - 19:23)
definitely see it as like a marketing (19:21 - 19:26)
ploy like I don't I can't really fathom (19:23 - 19:28)
a reason other than like there are (19:26 - 19:31)
metagame differences whatever but I (19:28 - 19:33)
can't really fathom any significant (19:31 - 19:36)
reason to not allow these games to (19:33 - 19:38)
connect with the other three dias ones i (19:36 - 19:40)
honestly think it is a way to like i (19:38 - 19:44)
know so many people who you know only (19:40 - 19:47)
care about the older pokemon games like (19:44 - 19:49)
they call themselves gen Wars you know (19:47 - 19:51)
like absolutely contingent of pokemon (19:49 - 19:53)
fan so I don't know that people are (19:51 - 19:56)
necessarily going out to buy the 3s just (19:53 - 19:58)
for these releases although they totally (19:56 - 20:00)
have that option with that new 3d s (19:58 - 20:01)
bundle (20:00 - 20:05)
but um I there are people who only are (20:01 - 20:06)
interested in those games and these (20:05 - 20:09)
those older ones and those older pokemon (20:06 - 20:12)
so explicitly saying hey buying these (20:09 - 20:15)
releases will give you easy access to (20:12 - 20:17)
getting these same pokemon in the new (20:15 - 20:19)
game so like you don't even have to mess (20:17 - 20:23)
with those weird other generations worth (20:19 - 20:25)
of Pokemon you don't know you can just (20:23 - 20:28)
bring your Charizard Senor you know your (20:25 - 20:33)
other popular gen 1 Pokemon right to the (20:28 - 20:35)
next one and you could even just start (20:33 - 20:37)
the game theoretically and just only use (20:35 - 20:39)
your gen 1 Pokemon still so it's just (20:37 - 20:42)
like a high quality you know fancier (20:39 - 20:44)
version of the game that you're already (20:42 - 20:46)
playing I just think it's like a really (20:44 - 20:48)
smart way that bring in those more (20:46 - 20:50)
nostalgic fans who don't really want to (20:48 - 20:54)
down to like the excessive very long (20:50 - 20:57)
history of Pokemon games that's really (20:54 - 20:59)
if I can be really intimidating to jump (20:57 - 21:01)
into if you haven't already been (20:59 - 21:03)
following along so I definitely think (21:01 - 21:06)
it's like a very concerted effort to (21:03 - 21:09)
appeal to those you know nostalgic fans (21:06 - 21:11)
who haven't necessarily been buying all (21:09 - 21:15)
the other games yeah yeah and pokemons (21:11 - 21:18)
going to always struggle where where is (21:15 - 21:21)
the right onboarding process for new (21:18 - 21:24)
players and I think I think black and (21:21 - 21:26)
white did a very good job at its period (21:24 - 21:28)
of bringing new people in I think x and (21:26 - 21:29)
y did a very good job of bringing new (21:28 - 21:33)
people in omega ruby alpha sapphire not (21:29 - 21:35)
so much it seemed more like fanservice (21:33 - 21:38)
than anything but I've had a couple (21:35 - 21:40)
friends who I would say that they are (21:38 - 21:42)
gen winners they don't believe anything (21:40 - 21:46)
exists after the first 150 Pokemon the (21:42 - 21:49)
kind of people who say can you believe (21:46 - 21:54)
they made an ice cream pocket man (21:49 - 21:54)
probably the same type of people but uh (21:54 - 21:59)
I had those people reach out to me man (21:56 - 22:02)
and these are people i don't talk to (21:59 - 22:05)
regularly or if if if even once a month (22:02 - 22:06)
but they reach out to me and they're (22:05 - 22:09)
like so how much is a 3ds do you have to (22:06 - 22:12)
get an SD card ok these are and how did (22:09 - 22:14)
the game save and what kind of charges (22:12 - 22:17)
do they use in library like legit (22:14 - 22:20)
considering getting a 3ds just for and (22:17 - 22:23)
and this was more than more than a (22:20 - 22:24)
handful of people that reached out to me (22:23 - 22:26)
and it was like okay like you guys are (22:24 - 22:28)
really like into this that's that's (22:26 - 22:30)
awesome and now i can say like hey if (22:28 - 22:33)
you if that was like what you liked and (22:30 - 22:35)
you actually went out and purchased 3ds (22:33 - 22:36)
and you played through red and blue (22:35 - 22:40)
again and like don't let your 3ds be a (22:36 - 22:42)
paperweight now that you've done what (22:40 - 22:44)
you went out to bought it for if go get (22:42 - 22:47)
sun and moon this holiday and take those (22:44 - 22:50)
pokemon with you and hopefully that is (22:47 - 22:52)
why i believe that's the mindset that (22:50 - 22:54)
game freak and pokemon company have but (22:52 - 22:56)
hopefully that does actually translate (22:54 - 23:00)
to customers into pokemon players yeah (22:56 - 23:03)
some other tidbits here from the (23:00 - 23:08)
presentation they did state that 275 (23:03 - 23:10)
million video games have been sold since (23:08 - 23:12)
the debut of pokemon red and green back (23:10 - 23:19)
in 1996 that is a lot and we touch we (23:12 - 23:21)
touched on traditional and simplified (23:19 - 23:25)
chinese being added to the game even if (23:21 - 23:27)
this doesn't apply for you this is still (23:25 - 23:29)
good for the long run because if they (23:27 - 23:32)
can sell more copies of the games that's (23:29 - 23:33)
more money that's more development (23:32 - 23:36)
that's more pokemon things in the future (23:33 - 23:39)
so that's good i have a quote here from (23:36 - 23:41)
JC smith the senior director of consumer (23:39 - 23:43)
marketing from tcp i-- he said the poke (23:41 - 23:45)
mon coeur series games are the center of (23:43 - 23:47)
the Pokemon universe and provides some (23:45 - 23:49)
of the most memorable pokemon moments (23:47 - 23:51)
for our fans i can't wait to see what (23:49 - 23:52)
fans think of the new adventures that (23:51 - 23:54)
will find in Pokemon Sun and Pokemon (23:52 - 23:57)
moon and yeah that was pretty much it (23:54 - 24:01)
that we got from the announcement so (23:57 - 24:02)
can we talk about my favorite part can (24:01 - 24:07)
we talk about baseless rumors sure yes I (24:02 - 24:11)
saw this one that I hope is untrue I'm (24:07 - 24:14)
negative I should be more positive thank (24:11 - 24:15)
you have the negative 1 Travis there's a (24:14 - 24:18)
new game coming out which I am over the (24:15 - 24:20)
moon I am over the Pokemon Sun and Moon (24:18 - 24:25)
about oh I can think about is rumors (24:20 - 24:28)
that I hate one of those rumors is that (24:25 - 24:34)
the the games will focus on pokemon (24:28 - 24:36)
human hybrids (24:34 - 24:39)
like I have ashes like ash's greninja (24:36 - 24:41)
being one of them I think we've already (24:39 - 24:45)
seen I believe it was in a corocoro (24:41 - 24:49)
article yes it's also an anime oh right (24:45 - 24:53)
right fine to be in the enemy and so (24:49 - 24:56)
there's that detail the second detail is (24:53 - 24:59)
that there is these little at least in (24:56 - 25:01)
the Japanese logos it seemed like that (24:59 - 25:04)
was the only place it was maybe I just (25:01 - 25:06)
missed it in the English logos but at (25:04 - 25:07)
least in the Japanese logos there's (25:06 - 25:11)
little crystals on both of them in a (25:07 - 25:13)
similar way to how there was the mega (25:11 - 25:15)
stone in the x and y logo there's these (25:13 - 25:17)
little crystals in the southern moon (25:15 - 25:20)
logo and those crystals are shaped (25:17 - 25:23)
identically to crystals that were used (25:20 - 25:25)
in the pokemon reversed manga oh I (25:23 - 25:27)
should credit whoever I'm stealing this (25:25 - 25:29)
from on Twitter so I'll look that up (25:27 - 25:32)
while I'm explaining it in the Pokemon (25:29 - 25:35)
reverse manga the premise of that book (25:32 - 25:38)
is that Pokemon fused with humans and (25:35 - 25:41)
then they fight in fact that it looks (25:38 - 25:44)
identical and we've announced ash's (25:41 - 25:46)
greninja as an actual thing lends (25:44 - 25:49)
credence to the idea and i don't love it (25:46 - 25:52)
but we'll see how that sounds like the (25:49 - 25:56)
fourth season of digimon yeah but which (25:52 - 26:01)
was terrible so please god no yeah I i (25:56 - 26:03)
hope that ash's greninja is something (26:01 - 26:05)
that stays in the anime just like it (26:03 - 26:08)
sounds like shadow Mewtwo is kind of (26:05 - 26:10)
only staying in the pokin tournament (26:08 - 26:13)
universe and just like the dark lugia (26:10 - 26:15)
and we stayed in gale of darkness I'm (26:13 - 26:20)
okay with stuff like that yeah I do want (26:15 - 26:22)
to shout out Allegra here for putting (26:20 - 26:24)
together one heck of an article on (26:22 - 26:30)
polygon calm yes I do this was posted (26:24 - 26:33)
just yesterday actually and you were (26:30 - 26:34)
unsure if you were gonna get it up I (26:33 - 26:36)
remember the last time we talked right (26:34 - 26:41)
yeah it was a long arduous process (26:36 - 26:43)
fighting with technology to make that (26:41 - 26:45)
little timeline it's like a (26:43 - 26:48)
chronological timeline of like all of (26:45 - 26:51)
the major Pokemon releases by my own (26:48 - 26:54)
estimation of what counts as a major (26:51 - 26:58)
release so just kind of trekking along (26:54 - 26:59)
the (26:58 - 27:02)
very long 20 year span of the series (26:59 - 27:06)
just noting you know each major release (27:02 - 27:09)
over the years and it took a real real (27:06 - 27:11)
real long time to put together so you (27:09 - 27:15)
guys check it out for reals anyway yeah (27:11 - 27:17)
it's really cool it makes me forget like (27:15 - 27:19)
b.o it reminds me that the Ranger games (27:17 - 27:23)
existed at one point yeah it's so weird (27:19 - 27:25)
that like they had three of those and (27:23 - 27:26)
then they just completely stopped and I (27:25 - 27:29)
think they sold pretty well like people (27:26 - 27:32)
like those games right maybe and then we (27:29 - 27:35)
just stopped making them after 2010 or (27:32 - 27:37)
whatever just completely fell off the (27:35 - 27:39)
face of the earth yeah that's why I've (27:37 - 27:41)
never played any of the Ranger games I (27:39 - 27:43)
just remember playing the first one cuz (27:41 - 27:46)
i wanted the manaphy i think you can get (27:43 - 27:49)
so maybe that was like everyone else too (27:46 - 27:51)
were they everyone just bought it just (27:49 - 27:53)
for the legendary and then they were (27:51 - 27:54)
like oh maybe people actually like these (27:53 - 27:57)
games but it's like no Nintendo we just (27:54 - 27:59)
want the town load right an easy way to (27:57 - 28:01)
sell a game attach a legendary that you (27:59 - 28:04)
can only get yeah same with a Pokemon (28:01 - 28:07)
Colosseum man all got it for the jirachi (28:04 - 28:10)
and then the other one was the Celebi (28:07 - 28:12)
that you could get when you bought that (28:10 - 28:15)
weird Pokemon ranch thing on the (28:12 - 28:19)
gamecube or was that we ah we yeah we (28:15 - 28:22)
where you could just store more Pokemon (28:19 - 28:23)
it was like pokemon bank before (28:22 - 28:27)
connecting to the internet mmhmm yeah so (28:23 - 28:29)
great article I'm polygon if you want to (28:27 - 28:32)
check that out otherwise I think that (28:29 - 28:37)
kind of wraps up our show I'm sure it (28:32 - 28:38)
can I give credit to the person I stole (28:37 - 28:41)
