favorite games from when I was eight (1:29 - 1:33)
years old here's my question for you (1:31 - 1:36)
good uh-huh did all the machines work (1:33 - 1:40)

[Music] (4:46 - 4:52)

hooray ahead of Pokemon Day 2020 which (4:54 - 5:00)
is held on February 27th the Pokemon (4:58 - 5:02)
company wall announced a new mythical (5:00 - 5:03)
Pokemon coming to Pokemon sword and (5:02 - 5:06)
shield will actually probably figure it (5:03 - 5:09)
well actually like boo papa (5:06 - 5:11)
we should know that on February 26 since (5:09 - 5:16)
Japan is in the future I think but but (5:11 - 5:18)
news doesn't travel between Japan and (5:16 - 5:19)
the United cells (5:18 - 5:20)
oh yes that's Chandler and from right (5:19 - 5:23)
there the neglect that we did telling (5:20 - 5:24)
them about the national dex stuff (5:23 - 5:26)
they've refused to share information (5:24 - 5:29)
with us right yes I understand the new (5:26 - 5:31)
Pokemon is expected to start in the (5:29 - 5:35)
upcoming pokémon animated film Coco the (5:31 - 5:38)
announcement was posted in the Japanese (5:35 - 5:40)
on the Japanese official website (5:38 - 5:42)
translated by Pokemon websites Arabi (5:40 - 5:45)
alongside the reveal sword and shield (5:42 - 5:47)
will also get a Mac a special max raid (5:45 - 5:50)
battle so what is that's probably either (5:47 - 5:52)
male metal or tax tricity (5:50 - 5:56)
I'm assuming any of the ones that (5:52 - 5:59)
already exist yeah it's I mean I don't (5:56 - 6:01)
know what I don't know like special (5:59 - 6:03)
means just about anything that doesn't (6:01 - 6:06)
have a help hole describe a new event in (6:03 - 6:08)
Pokemon go will also happen on Pokemon (6:06 - 6:11)
Day which is not part of our Pokemon (6:08 - 6:13)
good news they they seemingly stopped (6:11 - 6:15)
talking about events until up to that (6:13 - 6:19)
day there's no further information to (6:15 - 6:22)
expect from the myth of a creature three (6:19 - 6:24)
legendary pokémon already exist in (6:22 - 6:28)
Pokemon similarly za Chien Zama Zenta (6:24 - 6:31)

Pokemon called a target us and if you (6:48 - 6:54)
don't know the reason that February 27th (6:51 - 6:57)

sorcery cuz it looks like it's a sauce (9:03 - 9:09)
no it's a milk it's milk (9:05 - 9:12)
or yessiree sounds more like sorcery (9:09 - 9:14)
than Mill siree sounds like taste of (9:12 - 9:16)
loathing already has a saucer and (9:14 - 9:18)
there's probably legal ramifications for (9:16 - 9:21)
that who does but you don't use loathing (9:18 - 9:23)

sweets as rewards (10:39 - 10:43)
these include star sweets and ribbon (10:41 - 10:45)
sweets both which could not be obtained (10:43 - 10:48)

were promoted then you only need 54 but (11:37 - 11:46)
if you needed the shinies as well which (11:43 - 11:49)

don't have time for this no yeah yeah (13:34 - 13:38)
they're very true uh if you are not (13:35 - 13:41)
seeing the mill Suri's the same thing (13:38 - 13:44)
i've told people before go to the wild (13:41 - 13:46)
area news under mystery gift hit update (13:44 - 13:48)
wild area news you might have to clear (13:46 - 13:51)
out the current raids that exists so (13:48 - 13:52)
just by hitting that button doesn't (13:51 - 13:55)
suddenly change your raids it will (13:52 - 13:56)
update it and then you will have to (13:55 - 13:58)
probably clear them all out by either (13:56 - 13:59)
doing them or doing your friends raids (13:58 - 14:01)
which we've talked about before you have (13:59 - 14:02)
two raids left and you've already (14:01 - 14:04)
checked them and they end up being a (14:02 - 14:08)
five-star gold bass : and a three-star (14:04 - 14:12)
stunk tank once you check them if you do (14:08 - 14:13)
two of your friends raids that will (14:12 - 14:15)
clear out your raids or you just do them (14:13 - 14:18)
yourself whatever works for you but that (14:15 - 14:21)
should pop it up overall though you know (14:18 - 14:24)
we're a little bit we're almost three (14:21 - 14:27)
three months with this game and they're (14:24 - 14:31)
changing wild area pretty frequently you (14:27 - 14:33)
could maybe argue that (14:31 - 14:34)
these two things were not in the game (14:33 - 14:35)
now they're in the game so it's new (14:34 - 14:38)
content I don't know I think it's great (14:35 - 14:40)
I don't have any problem with it for (14:38 - 14:42)
somebody who continues to my Pokemon (14:40 - 14:43)
everyday it's really nice to be like hey (14:42 - 14:46)
there's new max raids I will say it (14:43 - 14:48)
injects like for this first few days (14:46 - 14:50)
when it happens it's like there's people (14:48 - 14:52)
everywhere and it's super exciting and (14:50 - 14:55)
then much like Pokemon go towards the (14:52 - 14:57)
end of the raids it's like is there (14:55 - 15:00)
anybody that can help no no and it's (14:57 - 15:03)
like these things I don't see them (15:00 - 15:05)
lining up with Mondays and Monday is (15:03 - 15:08)
raid night in Minnesota so I need them (15:05 - 15:10)
to orient them more towards Monday (15:08 - 15:13)
evenings thank you if if Pokemon is (15:10 - 15:17)
doing is adding raids and stuff well (15:13 - 15:19)
they are obviously we keep talking about (15:17 - 15:21)
them and it gets somebody to come back (15:19 - 15:24)
to the game for a even even a day or two (15:21 - 15:25)
that's more than what the old games were (15:24 - 15:27)
doing oh yeah I mean they're definitely (15:25 - 15:29)
adding value (15:27 - 15:34)
I mean value like the problem is is that (15:29 - 15:37)
once you get the one that you want like (15:34 - 15:39)
there's not a lot of reason to keep (15:37 - 15:39)
doing it (15:39 - 15:43)
yep and once you have the suite that you (15:39 - 15:46)
want and you use it on the mystery that (15:43 - 15:49)
you want then you're done yeah (15:46 - 15:52)
and it's like you know I'm tired of (15:49 - 15:54)
running into GMAX Lapras I'm tight it's (15:52 - 15:57)
like okay right a lot of these GMAX (15:54 - 15:59)
pokeman I've lasted like a month which i (15:57 - 16:02)
think is up is fine I mean that's how (15:59 - 16:04)
Pokemon go does it with like their (16:02 - 16:07)
tornadoes tornadoes is gonna be the next (16:04 - 16:08)
month long Pokemon I think that's fine (16:07 - 16:10)
you're gonna see people that get really (16:08 - 16:12)
excited to at the beginning there's (16:10 - 16:13)
gonna be that middle area where no one's (16:12 - 16:14)
doing it and then it's gonna be like (16:13 - 16:17)
atoms in two days everyone I didn't get (16:14 - 16:19)
it yet yeah I just wished that instead (16:17 - 16:23)
of swapping all four at the month they (16:19 - 16:25)
swapped two and then two weeks later (16:23 - 16:28)
they swapped two because of military (16:25 - 16:31)
yeah but I mean so that this is one and (16:28 - 16:33)
we're still with colossal we're still (16:31 - 16:35)
with all the others I wish it would just (16:33 - 16:38)
wrote a couple would rotate on a more (16:35 - 16:40)
frequent basis (16:38 - 16:44)
that would just make it feel more fresh (16:40 - 16:47)
I think so I have a question I have two (16:44 - 16:48)
questions here number one are the (16:47 - 16:52)
different mill Sarita elk Ramiz is it (16:48 - 16:54)
says is that just cosmetic yeah it's (16:52 - 16:56)
just cosmetic all right so I don't need (16:54 - 16:57)
to waste my time with that garbage (16:56 - 17:03)
number two GMAX flappable GMAX Appleton (16:57 - 17:05)
churros have been featured still re up (17:03 - 17:09)
until a la February 8th I think why do (17:05 - 17:11)
they both look exactly the same (17:09 - 17:14)
I hate I hate that the G max looks the (17:11 - 17:16)
same for both I don't know it's like (17:14 - 17:17)
they went back in the Apple I'm like you (17:16 - 17:19)
got out of the Apple dude don't go back (17:17 - 17:21)
into the Apple they went back in the (17:19 - 17:23)
apples of the sweet sweet caramel I know (17:21 - 17:25)
it's all gooey and everything I know who (17:23 - 17:27)
comes out whenever they like do a (17:25 - 17:30)
special or something oh it's kind of (17:27 - 17:34)
hard to watch and then Greg that one (17:30 - 17:35)
that we did together on Friday night I (17:34 - 17:36)
didn't catch it (17:35 - 17:37)
I think cuz I was like I'm gonna get an (17:36 - 17:39)
Appleton I don't care about the G max (17:37 - 17:41)
I'm gonna get an Appleton and I got no (17:39 - 17:44)
Appleton yeah I'd do it again it's hard (17:41 - 17:45)
enough to get me to play this game at (17:44 - 17:50)
all yet I made it to the outside of Rose (17:45 - 17:52)
tower and I was walking around picking (17:50 - 17:53)
up the stuff off the ground that's out (17:52 - 17:56)
there so probably tomorrow I'll go (17:53 - 17:58)
inside of Rose tower but tomorrow (17:56 - 18:01)
night's right night Morrow morning Oh (17:58 - 18:04)
hmm then you're fine maybe no well (18:01 - 18:05)
there's nothing about the post game that (18:04 - 18:08)
was gonna like you never know you never (18:05 - 18:10)
maybe when I just find something (18:08 - 18:12)
charming I am feared and I really like (18:10 - 18:16)
it or really hate it I mean between the (18:12 - 18:18)
two Beth hairstyles are about to appear (18:16 - 18:21)
in the post game I don't care about (18:18 - 18:23)
hairstyles I don't shave head thing in (18:21 - 18:25)
my game just like I do really no you'll (18:23 - 18:29)
care about these okay you won't believe (18:25 - 18:31)
number two you won't you and not believe (18:29 - 18:33)
number two this is off (18:31 - 18:37)
Destructoid is that still a thing yes (18:33 - 18:39)
sir they still got a little robot face (18:37 - 18:43)
yeah so does mr. reddit Nintendo calls (18:39 - 18:46)
Pokemon sword and shield a huge hit as (18:43 - 18:51)
it breaks 16 a million sales guess that (18:46 - 18:54)
uh boycott didn't (18:51 - 18:57)
but nobody told Japan no until you came (18:54 - 18:59)
to boy coming yeah what he told so I (18:57 - 19:03)
mean that's clearly through the lies and (18:59 - 19:06)
deception they made their money in its (19:03 - 19:09)
third quarter earnings release Nintendo (19:06 - 19:11)
announced that Pokemon sword and shield (19:09 - 19:13)
predictably led the way in sales racking (19:11 - 19:16)
up sixteen point zero six million units (19:13 - 19:19)
sold between mid November and its end of (19:16 - 19:23)
2019 calendar year it broke down between (19:19 - 19:25)
four point two million sales in Japan (19:23 - 19:29)
and eleven point eight five million (19:25 - 19:30)
sales throughout the rest of the world (19:29 - 19:35)
I don't think Japan was the problem here (19:30 - 19:35)
it's enough for Nintendo to single out (19:35 - 19:39)
the new pokemon calling it a huge hit (19:37 - 19:41)
pokemon sword and shield fared better (19:39 - 19:43)
than Pokemon Sun and Moon during its (19:41 - 19:46)
launch quarter Sun and Moon combined (19:43 - 19:49)
sold fourteen point six nine million cut (19:46 - 19:52)
nice copies on the 3ds and it currently (19:49 - 19:55)
sits at sixteen point one eight million (19:52 - 19:58)
sales meaning sword and shield has pasta (19:55 - 20:01)
has surpassed Sun and moons lifetime (19:58 - 20:03)
sales once January's figures have been (20:01 - 20:06)
totaled in it goes I'm talking about how (20:03 - 20:09)
Luigi's Mansion three did 5.3 million (20:06 - 20:11)
Super Mario maker - did five million (20:09 - 20:14)
Link's Awakening did four million Mario (20:11 - 20:19)
Kart 8 Deluxe is up to 22 million Wow (20:14 - 20:23)
geez that's a good game though is it on (20:19 - 20:26)
if you play it on the switch can let's (20:23 - 20:29)
play with you I might I love my wii you (20:26 - 20:32)
don't you don't rush on that I refuse to (20:29 - 20:35)
buy Mario Kart again idea that's kind of (20:32 - 20:36)
where I was (20:35 - 20:38)
there's a new one coming Mario Kart 9 is (20:36 - 20:41)
gonna come on the switch like December (20:38 - 20:44)
I'll buy it then yeah we get to get back (20:41 - 20:46)
into like when we used to do like Mario (20:44 - 20:48)
Kart on Wednesday nights yeah we might (20:46 - 20:50)
get together and cart it up I mean how (20:48 - 20:52)
disappointed was I that I was on an (20:50 - 20:55)
airplane when I did Pierce's gym and I (20:52 - 20:57)
couldn't hear his rockin Rock oh there (20:55 - 21:00)
was no rock and rocky how would you know (20:57 - 21:02)
you never play with the sound I played (21:00 - 21:04)
the whole game with this add-on I (21:02 - 21:06)
continued playing with the sound on (21:04 - 21:08)
and that hard to believe but the only (21:06 - 21:10)
thing I've done is I've turned down the (21:08 - 21:11)
sound effects because I think the (21:10 - 21:13)
whoever designed the audio in that game (21:11 - 21:16)
needs to be fired the sound effects it (21:13 - 21:19)
like the like menu items are so maybe (21:16 - 21:22)
miss mr. Matsuda maybe I don't think he (21:19 - 21:24)
did the he might've did the music I (21:22 - 21:25)
don't know if he did like what I'm (21:24 - 21:27)
talking about it's like that menu things (21:25 - 21:29)
like when you select something or when (21:27 - 21:31)
you're going up and down like that's (21:29 - 21:33)
also ear piercing to me and I don't know (21:31 - 21:35)
why I never even noticed any kind of (21:33 - 21:36)
noise at all (21:35 - 21:40)
so it's your youthful ears maybe I just (21:36 - 21:42)
again we always we always we always go (21:40 - 21:44)
through this kind of stuff (21:42 - 21:45)
let's go Pikachu let's go Eevee did (21:44 - 21:50)
11.76 million ultra son alternates Evan (21:45 - 21:53)
Sun and Moon sixteen point one eight (21:50 - 21:55)
this is actually these aren't fully (21:53 - 21:57)
updated but they're doesn't matter (21:55 - 21:59)
no one needs argue about the point (21:57 - 22:03)
whatever zero zero that comes after X&Y (21:59 - 22:06)
is sixteen point four four million black (22:03 - 22:10)
and white fifteen point six four diamond (22:06 - 22:12)
and pearl seventeen point six seven Ruby (22:10 - 22:17)
and Sapphire sixteen point two two so it (22:12 - 22:18)
looks like sword and shield it will (22:17 - 22:21)
probably be on track here too well they (22:18 - 22:23)
already passed sudden moon they are (22:21 - 22:25)
probably gonna pass X&Y (22:23 - 22:28)
is adjusted for inflation oh are you (22:25 - 22:30)
talking about price yeah I think it's (22:28 - 22:33)
copies it's not it's not exactly how (22:30 - 22:41)
many copies they've sold again not sure (22:33 - 22:43)
if it's gonna pass diamond pearl here (22:41 - 22:46)
with seventeen point six seven the the (22:43 - 22:47)
the more interesting conversation is (22:46 - 22:51)
like how many 3d asses existed in the (22:47 - 22:53)
world compared to how many switches (22:51 - 22:55)
exist in the world right now because Sun (22:53 - 22:57)
and Moon was near the end of the 3ds (22:55 - 22:59)
lifecycle which maybe this is percentage (22:57 - 23:01)
market shares what we're talking about (22:59 - 23:05)
here here we go which could hurt it to (23:01 - 23:07)
be like no one wants to play 3ds games (23:05 - 23:09)
anymore that's why it didn't sell as (23:07 - 23:11)
well as X&Y I doubt that I mean a (23:09 - 23:14)
Pokemon fan is a Pokemon fan and very (23:11 - 23:16)
few people hated the 3ds as much as you (23:14 - 23:17)
did (23:16 - 23:20)
so that's true it's yeah I did not (23:17 - 23:22)
the 3d well I like the VDS it just it (23:20 - 23:26)
went it lived too long don't fib you did (23:22 - 23:28)
not like the 3ds you did not hold love (23:26 - 23:32)
for it in your heart I like yeah me too (23:28 - 23:33)
you know you know what I liked about the (23:32 - 23:35)
3ds as I went to the auto mechanic on (23:33 - 23:37)
Friday afternoon you could put the 3ds (23:35 - 23:39)
in your pocket and it was relatively in (23:37 - 23:42)
a truce unobtrusive you put a big ole (23:39 - 23:44)
switch in your pocket and everybody's (23:42 - 23:47)
like Mae West what put things in their (23:44 - 23:49)
pockets anymore you gotta have the (23:47 - 23:51)
either the Sandy pack or the backpack oh (23:49 - 23:55)
heck no no that's you Millennials and (23:51 - 23:56)
you boomers with your fanny packs and (23:55 - 23:58)
backpacks s Gen Xers are like put it in (23:56 - 24:01)
your pocket or don't care at all I mean (23:58 - 24:05)
I did buy a nutsack but I don't use it (24:01 - 24:06)
I should use it in the summer but I (24:05 - 24:09)
don't mmm the other side I'm moving on (24:06 - 24:11)
very quickly for my statement the other (24:09 - 24:15)
side of the coin here is just the amount (24:11 - 24:19)
of bad press prior to this game compared (24:15 - 24:21)
to other games in the series like the (24:19 - 24:24)
most you've heard complaining about Sun (24:21 - 24:26)
and Moon like the hand holding at the (24:24 - 24:28)
beginning or how like it was so tutorial (24:26 - 24:30)
eyes at least with the X&Y that I (24:28 - 24:31)
remember I don't know if you guys (24:30 - 24:33)
remember differently was just the lack (24:31 - 24:36)
of postgame specifically in X&Y was the (24:33 - 24:39)
huge complaint there but with sword and (24:36 - 24:41)
shield there was obviously we don't have (24:39 - 24:43)
to go in depth of the narrative it (24:41 - 24:46)
existed we lived through it but the (24:43 - 24:48)
narrative that existed on Twitter and (24:46 - 24:51)
reddit and because Game Freak didn't (24:48 - 24:53)
control the message or some people (24:51 - 24:54)
believe that because Game Freak didn't (24:53 - 24:57)
control the message or hashtag Game (24:54 - 24:59)
Freak lied that that was her that would (24:57 - 25:01)
hurt sales when in reality that didn't (24:59 - 25:03)
happen and I think I think that just (25:01 - 25:07)
overall shows how it correct me if I'm (25:03 - 25:10)
wrong how a very very small percentage (25:07 - 25:13)
of people were very very loud and even (25:10 - 25:15)
though they were loud it didn't affect (25:13 - 25:19)
the fan that walks in buys a Pokemon (25:15 - 25:20)
game gets to the end of the game plays (25:19 - 25:23)
it satisfy it puts it down goes back to (25:20 - 25:26)
apex legends when they're done (25:23 - 25:29)
nobody's going back to apex which is I (25:26 - 25:31)
think what it really is a testament to (25:29 - 25:34)
is the old phrase there's no such thing (25:31 - 25:36)
as bad press and all of these people (25:34 - 25:38)
fussing and moaning raise attention to (25:36 - 25:40)
the fact of hey there's a new pokemon (25:38 - 25:43)
yeah and people who just didn't care (25:40 - 25:45)
we're like they got they got their (25:43 - 25:46)
attention like where they might not have (25:45 - 25:49)
gotten their attention before I also (25:46 - 25:50)
think the thing that they were (25:49 - 25:53)
complaining about a lot of people didn't (25:50 - 25:55)
care about Oh like not having a Pokemon (25:53 - 25:59)
yeah like you don't have that until the (25:55 - 26:01)
end of the game anyways so for a vast (25:59 - 26:04)
majority of people that wasn't gonna be (26:01 - 26:07)
a big issue and the complaints about (26:04 - 26:10)
this texture or that texture or these (26:07 - 26:13)
trees or that trees don't bother a ton (26:10 - 26:16)
of people the game looks great (26:13 - 26:17)
like its (26:16 - 26:20)
it's a very cartoon cell shade style and (26:17 - 26:21)
if you don't like that style you're (26:20 - 26:23)
never gonna like that style but for a (26:21 - 26:25)
lot of people that's a really attractive (26:23 - 26:28)
style and you expect sort of a cartoony (26:25 - 26:30)
feel and it gives that so I think a lot (26:28 - 26:33)
of the complaints just didn't resonate (26:30 - 26:37)
with a vast majority of people I'd you (26:33 - 26:39)
know as somebody who played Arkanoid (26:37 - 26:42)
last night and had a heck of a time they (26:39 - 26:45)
say once again if you know it's not one (26:42 - 26:47)
rectangle bouncing against another (26:45 - 26:50)
rectangle on the screen I'm thrilled you (26:47 - 26:52)
know y'all have your expectations are (26:50 - 26:57)
set way too high but Greg the but the (26:52 - 27:00)
post on writer got 2000 up votes about (26:57 - 27:04)
how the title screen and sword and (27:00 - 27:09)
shield was uninspired and bad I like it (27:04 - 27:11)
my panel stadium no yeah I like the (27:09 - 27:12)
title screen too but that was actually (27:11 - 27:15)
one of the things I mean sure I could I (27:12 - 27:17)
could go and probably get a ton of votes (27:15 - 27:19)
on something that I want to pick apart (27:17 - 27:22)
like that's not it's not hard to find a (27:19 - 27:24)
small minority of people to agree with (27:22 - 27:26)
you especially if you're gonna be super (27:24 - 27:28)
negative about something very popular (27:26 - 27:31)
that's like the easiest get in the world (27:28 - 27:34)
well speaking of Pokemon fans getting (27:31 - 27:39)
mad okay they announced Pokemon Homes (27:34 - 27:42)
pricing oh now here's where you're gonna (27:39 - 27:44)
get me all charged up so we're gonna (27:42 - 27:47)
take a quick break and when we come back (27:44 - 27:48)
I have the press release here for (27:47 - 27:50)
Pokemon home we're gonna go through this (27:48 - 27:52)
and what we know what we don't know yet (27:50 - 27:55)
but yeah let's take a quick break and (27:52 - 27:57)
when we get back we will talk about (27:55 - 27:59)
Pokemon home (27:57 - 27:59)
[Music] (27:59 - 28:03)
deciduous said she got evergreen they (28:11 - 28:19)

[Music] (28:40 - 28:48)
Pokemon home to launch in February 2020 (28:43 - 28:52)
yeah no date yet on February 7th press (28:48 - 28:54)
release here today the Pope this was on (28:52 - 28:55)
January 28th (28:54 - 28:58)
today the Pokemon company International (28:55 - 28:59)
and Nintendo has announced more details (28:58 - 29:02)
for a new cloud service app Pokemon home (28:59 - 29:04)
the app enables trainers to continue (29:02 - 29:06)
their Pokemon adventures beyond a single (29:04 - 29:09)
game system and manage their collection (29:06 - 29:11)
of pokemon across many of their games (29:09 - 29:15)
pokemon home will launch february 2024 (29:11 - 29:19)
iPhone iPad and Android devices as well (29:15 - 29:22)
as the Nintendo switch system this is (29:19 - 29:24)
just an apple thing but I'm very curious (29:22 - 29:27)
if the iPhone and iPad app apps will be (29:24 - 29:29)
different because they listed them (29:27 - 29:31)
differently into this instead of just (29:29 - 29:34)
saying iOS or if the iPad app is just (29:31 - 29:36)
gonna be like a glorified iPhone app I (29:34 - 29:37)
mean I don't know what they would make (29:36 - 29:41)
different well like well using the (29:37 - 29:43)
actual I look because the iPad has (29:41 - 29:45)
gestures and has abilities to like (29:43 - 29:49)
multitask and stuff also if it's not if (29:45 - 29:52)
it's a dedicated iPhone app on the iPad (29:49 - 29:54)
and you have to use the I want to expand (29:52 - 29:55)
this to fill the screen that's always (29:54 - 29:58)
waffle like Instagram on an iPad is just (29:55 - 30:03)
a disgrace designed as a place where all (29:58 - 30:05)
pokémon can gather Pokemon home will (30:03 - 30:07)
enable trainers to bring over pokemon (30:05 - 30:10)
from linked pokemon series games and (30:07 - 30:12)
deposit them in boxes in the cloud or (30:10 - 30:14)
move them around to linked compatible (30:12 - 30:17)
games by linking the same Nintendo (30:14 - 30:18)
account to both the Nintendo switch and (30:17 - 30:21)
the mobile device version fans will be (30:18 - 30:24)
able to access the same Pokemon boxes (30:21 - 30:26)
from both hardware platforms the (30:24 - 30:28)
Nintendo switch version of Pokemon home (30:26 - 30:30)
supports connectivity with the Nintendo (30:28 - 30:33)
switch games pokemon sword Pokemon (30:30 - 30:35)
shield Pokemon let's go Pikachu and (30:33 - 30:37)
let's go Eevee both Nintendo's switched (30:35 - 30:39)
versions and the mobile device version (30:37 - 30:41)
of Pokemon home will support (30:39 - 30:43)
connectivity with the 3d software (30:41 - 30:47)
pokemon bank support for Pokemon go is (30:43 - 30:53)
in development like last week I bet this (30:47 - 30:56)
launches with up a go (30:53 - 31:00)
uhh it's fine it's fine it's not the end (30:56 - 31:04)
of the world I need space yes ok I can't (31:00 - 31:07)
disagree with you but you can just buy (31:04 - 31:09)
the space Greg it's permanent you don't (31:07 - 31:11)
have to pay a yearly fee for it you can (31:09 - 31:13)
just give me antique money (31:11 - 31:16)
I fully maxed out my Pokemon storage (31:13 - 31:18)
space and I still run out of space for (31:16 - 31:20)

the content of the DVD may be the most (33:59 - 34:05)
incredible fantastic work of art and (34:02 - 34:07)
genius and emotionally grabbing all of (34:05 - 34:12)
it none of that bears any fruit until (34:07 - 34:16)
the DVD is placed into a DVD player (34:12 - 34:16)
the DVD is played I haven't been (34:16 - 34:22)
motivated to go that far so it's it's (34:20 - 34:24)
right it's right there in front of my (34:22 - 34:29)
television just even but the the (34:24 - 34:31)
PlayStation the PlayStation will do it (34:29 - 34:33)

weights ways to trade easily Pokemon (34:33 - 34:39)

traded to Pokemon when Pokemon home is (34:55 - 35:02)
not being used with the GTS it's back (34:57 - 35:04)
that was a complaint that is why sword (35:02 - 35:05)
and shield wasn't gonna sell well Greg (35:04 - 35:07)
because they took out the GTS I mean I (35:05 - 35:09)

well free no it's completely free don't (35:13 - 35:22)
even start real cost of a (35:17 - 35:22)
if only I made a very handy graphic that (35:23 - 35:29)
you can see of the prices I saw that (35:26 - 35:32)
graphic I think that's a manipulation of (35:29 - 35:35)
of reality right there (35:32 - 35:38)
fans can specify which Pokemon they want (35:35 - 35:39)
to trade in which Pokemon they want to (35:38 - 35:42)
receive they will match with a trainer (35:39 - 35:45)

breed one shiny jewel tick (36:13 - 36:18)
I accidentally braided two shiny ticks (36:15 - 36:21)
without realizing it so one of those may (36:18 - 36:24)
show up on the GTS as a completely (36:21 - 36:26)
legitimate because I don't need more (36:24 - 36:29)
than one shiny jewel tick I mean keep (36:26 - 36:31)

reminds me I can't remember if it was (37:38 - 37:41)
diamond and pearl or black and white I'm (37:39 - 37:43)

you would actually go into a special (37:43 - 37:48)
room and like walk up to the person I'm (37:45 - 37:50)
sure they both actually to trade with (37:48 - 37:52)

people in a room and I did picture what (38:13 - 38:17)
will said like the black and white thing (38:15 - 38:19)
of walking around I think that's cool (38:17 - 38:22)

home points for battle points to be used (41:48 - 41:53)
in core series Pokemon games so they (41:50 - 41:55)
basically taken all the stuff that was (41:53 - 41:56)
on the global link that they've decided (41:55 - 41:59)
to turn off and moved it over into (41:56 - 42:02)
Pokemon home and it does the same thing (41:59 - 42:05)
with battle points that Pokemon bank did (42:02 - 42:08)
yes what about all the points that I (42:05 - 42:10)
built up in Pokemon bank that I never (42:08 - 42:12)
used cash them out for sorta it was cash (42:10 - 42:15)
them out for Sun and Moon yeah I had (42:12 - 42:17)
this argument with various amounts of (42:15 - 42:20)
people that were like I have 8000 battle (42:17 - 42:22)
points and Pokemon bank I can't wait to (42:20 - 42:24)
catch the 9000 I can't wait to cash them (42:22 - 42:26)
out and sword and shield and I was like (42:24 - 42:26)
you're good (42:26 - 42:28)
I've learned anything about Pokemon this (42:26 - 42:30)
is the same company that has made me (42:28 - 42:34)
collect Jenna sex dumb little disk (42:30 - 42:38)
drives in every game hey you need a (42:34 - 42:42)
flame orb great you can get that in (42:38 - 42:44)
every version of the game because you're (42:42 - 42:46)
not gonna be able to transfer it over (42:44 - 42:48)
I'm aware hey you know all that money (42:46 - 42:52)
you have in Sun and Moon it's staying in (42:48 - 42:55)
Sun and Moon oh well cuz those are a (42:52 - 43:00)
Lola box oh and now I need Galler bucks (42:55 - 43:05)
that's actually why I'm a fan like I I'm (43:00 - 43:07)
excited for the expansion and that (43:05 - 43:10)
regards of like oh cool I don't have to (43:07 - 43:13)
worry about rebuilding up all my wats in (43:10 - 43:16)
a new game or all my money in a new game (43:13 - 43:18)
or rebind all the clothes that I've (43:16 - 43:20)
bought in this game in the new game even (43:18 - 43:21)
though a lot of the clothes will be the (43:20 - 43:23)
same or like a third version I should (43:21 - 43:27)
say you wanna hear pricing I mean if you (43:23 - 43:29)
want to hear me scream yell and shout (43:27 - 43:31)
yeah go right ahead (43:29 - 43:38)
one month $2.99 three months $4.99 (43:31 - 43:45)
twelve months $15.99 so clarify this for (43:38 - 43:46)
me (43:45 - 43:49)
it's $15.99 int on top of the Nintendo (43:46 - 43:51)
online but Nintendo online is not (43:49 - 43:53)
necessarily required to use Pokemon home (43:51 - 43:56)
correct switch you didn't rat need a (43:53 - 44:00)
Nintendo online to use this I just this (43:56 - 44:04)
this was my argument before though Y if (44:00 - 44:08)
if I was just a Pokemon go player why (44:04 - 44:10)
would they forced me to get Nintendo (44:08 - 44:13)
online if I don't have a switch okay (44:10 - 44:15)
that's that's fine I that and from that (44:13 - 44:17)
perspective of the person who's only a (44:15 - 44:19)
Pokemon go player I would also question (44:17 - 44:21)
if I was a Pokemon go player the (44:19 - 44:23)
injustice of other Pokemon players (44:21 - 44:28)
getting a very very similar service not (44:23 - 44:30)
completely similar but I mean exactly (44:28 - 44:32)
the same but very similar service at the (44:30 - 44:33)
main point being online storage of my (44:32 - 44:37)
Pokemon for five dollars a year for so (44:33 - 44:40)
many years and now I just want to be (44:37 - 44:40)
able to store my (44:40 - 44:42)
c'mon and maybe do some trades although (44:40 - 44:45)
I can trade in Pokemon go so whatever (44:42 - 44:51)
for three times as much per year yeah I (44:45 - 44:53)
want to point out that Pokemon bank one (44:51 - 44:56)
is seven years old and two never changed (44:53 - 45:01)
in seven years so like I got a fancy (44:56 - 45:02)
distribution of psycho distributions (45:01 - 45:05)
from they've got distributions but that (45:02 - 45:08)
actual app never changed okay correct (45:05 - 45:11)
but this is the this is the question (45:08 - 45:12)
that I have to ask myself when I'm (45:11 - 45:15)
looking at this price is they're three (45:12 - 45:19)
times more content that's worth it then (45:15 - 45:23)
Bank so if you're paying five dollars to (45:19 - 45:24)
store in Bank and that never ever (45:23 - 45:26)
changed and that's all you're going to (45:24 - 45:30)
do is paying fifteen well sixteen (45:26 - 45:32)
dollars basically I don't know I said (45:30 - 45:39)
fifteen that's the way it's annoying is (45:32 - 45:41)
that price point something that's worth (45:39 - 45:44)
it like the question becomes all of (45:41 - 45:46)
these other functions that they're (45:44 - 45:48)
adding in are they worth three times the (45:46 - 45:50)
price which we can't tell into which I (45:48 - 45:53)
don't access to the product yes I mean I (45:50 - 45:58)
I think it's I think it's fine but I do (45:53 - 46:02)
think it's it is at the very upper limit (45:58 - 46:03)
of what they could get away with I think (46:02 - 46:05)
my upper limit would have been 20 oh I (46:03 - 46:07)
don't think anybody would about in for (46:05 - 46:10)
20 I mean I would have yeah I know no we (46:07 - 46:12)
know I would have because we're idiots (46:10 - 46:16)
keep supporting this pokemons our (46:12 - 46:19)
Pokemon Laura and Master and whatever (46:16 - 46:22)
they want to do to us I think it would (46:19 - 46:25)
have been better closer to 10 or 12 I (46:22 - 46:27)
attend yes I think 10 would have been my (46:25 - 46:30)
optimal price point right yeah I mean I (46:27 - 46:32)
think they're put I think they're really (46:30 - 46:36)
pushing it and they're relying on all (46:32 - 46:38)
these other features being so (46:36 - 46:40)
spectacular that you don't let you feel (46:38 - 46:43)
like you're getting value out of it like (46:40 - 46:46)
what they're showing is like okay (46:43 - 46:48)
this used to be free in the other games (46:46 - 46:51)
like the GS was always there and the GTS (46:48 - 46:52)
is completely free you don't have to pay (46:51 - 46:54)
for anything you do have to pay for (46:52 - 46:56)
certain aspects of it no you don't (46:54 - 46:58)
ability to do certain things no if you (46:56 - 47:01)
want to just use this as the GTS you can (46:58 - 47:03)
deposit one Pokemon at a time correct (47:01 - 47:05)
which is there in how it always was in (47:03 - 47:07)
all the games there's no cost of that (47:05 - 47:11)
but there is additional features if you (47:07 - 47:13)
pay yeah but that's how everything is (47:11 - 47:16)
yeah but I'm saying it's it there is (47:13 - 47:21)
still the there is still the view and (47:16 - 47:24)
what they're showing that you aren't (47:21 - 47:27)
getting the full GTS because there is a (47:24 - 47:29)
part that is behind a paywall whether or (47:27 - 47:32)
not that's what it used to do there is a (47:29 - 47:35)
part of what is details behind a paywall (47:32 - 47:39)
that you can do to extra yeah well there (47:35 - 47:40)
you go and especially like if I'm like (47:39 - 47:43)
trying to empty out my boxes and stuff (47:40 - 47:45)
like that and in like a fun way yeah I'm (47:43 - 47:46)
gonna have to pay for those two extra (47:45 - 47:50)
slots so what like why like I don't (47:46 - 47:51)
think that's a valid complaint to be (47:50 - 47:53)
like oh and they're charging me for two (47:51 - 47:56)
extra spots because that's brand-new it (47:53 - 47:59)
is a valid complaint because what I'm (47:56 - 48:02)
saying is people don't will no longer (47:59 - 48:06)
look at it used to be a one on one thing (48:02 - 48:09)
what they will see is there is another (48:06 - 48:13)
functionality behind a paywall whether (48:09 - 48:16)
or not that's new or not isn't part of (48:13 - 48:19)
that complaint the complaint is there (48:16 - 48:22)
are features from a thing that used to (48:19 - 48:24)
be free that are now behind a paywall (48:22 - 48:27)
whether or not that's that's a one for (48:24 - 48:29)
one thing doesn't matter that is the (48:27 - 48:32)
viewpoint that exists yeah people aren't (48:29 - 48:34)
people aren't you who are looking at the (48:32 - 48:36)
you know have this whole like studied (48:34 - 48:38)
history of everything that happened and (48:36 - 48:40)
did it happen but I mean the average (48:38 - 48:43)
person is not like that and what they're (48:40 - 48:44)
doing is like if they looked at Sun and (48:43 - 48:46)
Moon they probably didn't look at Sun (48:44 - 48:48)
and Moon to say what GTS features are (48:46 - 48:50)
there but here we're looking at Pokemon (48:48 - 48:52)
home and G the GTS feature is a (48:50 - 48:54)
prominent component of that so of course (48:52 - 48:56)
they have to look at that and now (48:54 - 48:58)
they're saying well waive the the (48:56 - 49:00)
the free people get one and the pay-for (48:58 - 49:04)
people get three for $15 but like my (49:00 - 49:06)
whole problem with us right it's not (49:04 - 49:08)
it's not really even the price point (49:06 - 49:11)
obviously I can pay $15 all right that's (49:08 - 49:14)
sectional change I drop really nice (49:11 - 49:17)
always 60 no you know the other day but (49:14 - 49:20)
[Music] (49:17 - 49:20)
$14.99 would have been so much easier (49:21 - 49:24)
it's okay (49:23 - 49:28)
my issue is and this is like the first (49:24 - 49:30)
reaction that I had when I saw this (49:28 - 49:33)
price point is number one the Pokemon (49:30 - 49:36)
games are aren't cheap right how much (49:33 - 49:37)
did I pay for there's no different than (49:36 - 49:39)
any other game I don't like that is a (49:37 - 49:41)
good boy once again I live in a pokémon (49:39 - 49:45)
only world so there's six dollars like (49:41 - 49:52)
every single xbox360 one game in my life (49:45 - 49:53)
i play pokemon that's the only get and i (49:52 - 49:56)
barely play that $60 okay and then to (49:53 - 49:58)
get the full experience of playing (49:56 - 50:01)
pokemon that I already paid $60 on my (49:58 - 50:04)
$300 which I had to pay 20 more dollars (50:01 - 50:07)
a year to get pokken Nintendo online so (50:04 - 50:10)
I don't have to pay $5 to get the full (50:07 - 50:14)
experience okay that that okay I hate (50:10 - 50:15)
this complaint because that has nothing (50:14 - 50:17)
to do with Pokemon you want to play (50:15 - 50:19)
Monster Hunter generations ultimate (50:17 - 50:21)
guess what you also have to have (50:19 - 50:25)
Nintendo's which I am I am I am accusing (50:21 - 50:27)
the entire Nintendo world because this (50:25 - 50:29)
is this is where I'm gonna get to (50:27 - 50:31)
alright so and now I had to do another (50:29 - 50:33)
$15 for the for the full complete (50:31 - 50:35)
Pokemon experience and actually it was (50:33 - 50:37)
like 120 because I have have to get sort (50:35 - 50:38)
of shield cuz I got to be one of the (50:37 - 50:40)
cool kids (50:38 - 50:45)
but comparatively but what's my reaction (50:40 - 50:49)
was is what we're approaching is I pay (50:45 - 50:55)
what $60 a year for PS Plus mm-hmm and I (50:49 - 50:58)
get I feel like I get a heck of a lot (50:55 - 51:03)
more for PS Plus for my $60 then my now (50:58 - 51:07)
$35 that's going for Nintendo online (51:03 - 51:09)
services is getting me okay but that has (51:07 - 51:11)
nothing to do with Game Freak now I know (51:09 - 51:13)
but that's fine it's it's this is this (51:11 - 51:15)
is an economic discussion I'm not in I'm (51:13 - 51:17)
not accusing gamefreak of anything I'm (51:15 - 51:20)
just saying the value proposition that I (51:17 - 51:23)
am now getting from the Nintendo Pokemon (51:20 - 51:28)
universe is approaching the cost of a PS (51:23 - 51:30)
plus service or an Xbox Live service but (51:28 - 51:32)
the value that I'm getting is is (51:30 - 51:35)
reducing in equivalency so that I (51:32 - 51:38)
actually get I can see myself as getting (51:35 - 51:40)
more value from PS plus for my dollar (51:38 - 51:42)
than I am getting from Nintendo online (51:40 - 51:45)
services including Pokemon bank and you (51:42 - 51:48)
know whatever else Animal Crossing if I (51:45 - 51:50)
invest in that particular title or (51:48 - 51:54)
anything like that that is just like I (51:50 - 51:54)
looking at the history of what we got (51:54 - 52:01)
from Nintendo and Pokemon it's it's like (51:58 - 52:04)
they're the way it used to be was they (52:01 - 52:06)
could be seen as not the money grubbers (52:04 - 52:09)
that they were like generous with when (52:06 - 52:11)
you bought your game they were very (52:09 - 52:12)
generous with what you got from them (52:11 - 52:15)
whereas Xbox and Playstation we're very (52:12 - 52:18)
sort of on the greedy side of we're (52:15 - 52:20)
gonna nickel-and-dime you for every (52:18 - 52:21)
little thing that comes down the line (52:20 - 52:24)
and it's like as nintendo becomes more (52:21 - 52:27)
appears to become more greedy i don't (52:24 - 52:29)
feel like i'm getting the same amount of (52:27 - 52:31)
value no of course that's my like first (52:29 - 52:34)
visceral reaction down the line I may be (52:31 - 52:37)
thrilled if I may you know maybe Pokemon (52:34 - 52:41)
home will be a continuing continually (52:37 - 52:44)
developing software so that they'll add (52:41 - 52:46)
in new features and new services over (52:44 - 52:48)
time although they never did with (52:46 - 52:51)
Pokemon bank so little hope for that and (52:48 - 52:53)
then it'll be like worth my dollar (52:51 - 52:56)
just from the outset my first reaction (52:53 - 52:58)
that I see this is like they're asking (52:56 - 53:00)
for more money and they're just not (52:58 - 53:02)
giving me the same amount of value from (53:00 - 53:06)
it so we'll have to see also the xxx (53:02 - 53:09)
Pokemon storage - six Tests book about (53:06 - 53:11)
sorry just like wait like while this (53:09 - 53:16)
issue it's one box so I might get a box (53:11 - 53:17)
am I getting a new professor wearing (53:16 - 53:20)
Crocs or is the same Pokemon bank (53:17 - 53:24)
wearing Crocs I don't know what about (53:20 - 53:30)
yeah please room here (53:24 - 53:34)
bridgett will be a 499 micro transaction (53:30 - 53:43)
Bridget's not even a tree she does it (53:34 - 53:45)
she does not wear a racket why does she (53:43 - 53:48)
wear she's very accepting white Roxy (53:45 - 53:51)
look heard TCG card is definitely not (53:48 - 53:54)
safe for work oh she is wearing Crocs oh (53:51 - 53:57)
she's wearing uh it's like it's a sari (53:54 - 54:00)
she's wearing while she's wearing a (53:57 - 54:02)
dress and it's just like a blue coat (54:00 - 54:05)
it's like a blue sweater coat difference (54:02 - 54:08)
between basic and premium so if you're (54:05 - 54:09)
in the basic plan that you are not (54:08 - 54:11)
allowed to move from Pokemon bank (54:09 - 54:14)
although logistically this is going to (54:11 - 54:16)
happen once for the majority of people (54:14 - 54:18)
right yes this is gonna be a one-time (54:16 - 54:21)
thing if you are if you are upset about (54:18 - 54:23)
the sixteen dollars I'm trying to think (54:21 - 54:26)
about this in like a sense of like well (54:23 - 54:27)
they're already giving everyone a month (54:26 - 54:29)
free of bank and they're already giving (54:27 - 54:31)
everyone a month free of home there's a (54:29 - 54:33)
month free of home when I think ending a (54:31 - 54:35)
month free of bank yeah that's what I (54:33 - 54:37)
said the beginning yeah oh yeah yeah (54:35 - 54:38)
they are and that's why I was (54:37 - 54:40)
complaining that I should get my money (54:38 - 54:42)
back they did say they're giving it I (54:40 - 54:43)
don't know I don't remember what I read (54:42 - 54:45)
they did say they're giving away a month (54:43 - 54:46)
free of home when it comes out right (54:45 - 54:49)
yeah the first 30 days so you can try it (54:46 - 54:54)
so completely for free you can move all (54:49 - 54:58)
your Pokemon and Pokemon home to Pokemon (54:54 - 55:00)
bank for Pokemon bank to Pokemon home (54:58 - 55:02)
completely for free if you are don't pay (55:00 - 55:05)
for bank and you don't pay for home (55:02 - 55:10)
realistically if you once you do that (55:05 - 55:13)
you can stop paying for bank altogether (55:10 - 55:15)
I mean I also have been so much you have (55:13 - 55:17)
in your bank because you only if you're (55:15 - 55:20)
not paying you have spots for 30 and (55:17 - 55:23)
that's it well you got what so this is (55:20 - 55:25)
how it worked in huh Bank we don't know (55:23 - 55:29)
that my assumption is you can you can (55:25 - 55:30)
throw it all in there (55:29 - 55:33)
because you have 6,000 in the during (55:30 - 55:35)
your free trial and then if you don't (55:33 - 55:38)
move them you can't put any more in but (55:35 - 55:41)
you can still take them out because (55:38 - 55:42)
that's how Bank works if you stop paying (55:41 - 55:45)
for Bank you can't put anything else in (55:42 - 55:46)
but you can still withdraw all that (55:45 - 55:49)
stuff eventually so you can withdraw all (55:46 - 55:51)
your things into sword and shield (55:49 - 55:56)
granted it's one of the 400 Pokemon that (55:51 - 55:59)
exist although I guess you can go up to (55:56 - 56:01)
about 600 Pokemon once the expansion (55:59 - 56:04)
comes out for the they have to they have (56:01 - 56:06)
to know their number like they have to (56:04 - 56:09)
know how many people use Bank daily (56:06 - 56:12)
monthly yearly how many people actually (56:09 - 56:16)
transfer Pokemon from X & Y to Sun and (56:12 - 56:18)
Moon because that you could only do that (56:16 - 56:20)
with bank so they must know in a sense (56:18 - 56:24)
like who's using what service and if (56:20 - 56:29)
then like how did they go from 30 to (56:24 - 56:32)
6000 like I can't imagine that's just (56:29 - 56:35)
one box is fine they must know that like (56:32 - 56:38)
there are two types of audiences there's (56:35 - 56:40)
an audience that just uses very little (56:38 - 56:42)
and then there's the hardcore audience (56:40 - 56:43)
that has thousands of thousands of (56:42 - 56:46)
Pokemon maybe not I don't know well I (56:43 - 56:48)
would say the Pokemon games have (56:46 - 56:49)
generally been antagonistic (56:48 - 56:52)
about carrying Pokemon forward I mean (56:49 - 56:54)
just if you think about moving from gen (56:52 - 56:57)
4 to Gen 5 and you had to do that stupid (56:54 - 57:02)
uh shoot the arrow oh man they did not (56:57 - 57:04)
want you to move those Pokemon forward (57:02 - 57:05)
yeah I mean this is where I would say (57:04 - 57:07)
like I would literally pay for (57:05 - 57:10)
convenience like he could I don't want (57:07 - 57:12)
to shoot my arrows at six Pokemon at a (57:10 - 57:14)
time go back out grab another six shoot (57:12 - 57:17)
some arrows like my time like sixteen (57:14 - 57:19)
dollars to not do that for four (57:17 - 57:22)
Pokemon sign me up yeah but you also (57:19 - 57:25)
hate money no I don't hate money but (57:22 - 57:29)
like my time is is valuable and there's (57:25 - 57:32)
like nothing fun about that specific (57:29 - 57:34)
minigame to like move Pokemon over and (57:32 - 57:36)
don't get me started how to move Pokemon (57:34 - 57:38)
over from Platinum to or from diamond a (57:36 - 57:42)
pearl the whole silver that was like (57:38 - 57:45)
let's take the six Pokemon drop them in (57:42 - 57:47)
this bad safari zone you have to find (57:45 - 57:50)
them throw a Pokeball and then come back (57:47 - 57:53)
when to catch ugh four times longer than (57:50 - 57:55)
the arrow game I at least got good at (57:53 - 57:58)
the arrow game at that point so again I (57:55 - 58:01)
am coming from like Geoff's sure if this (57:58 - 58:03)
is instant and I can just pay for it and (58:01 - 58:05)
I don't have to go through any minigames (58:03 - 58:06)
I guess the argument would be like well (58:05 - 58:08)
why don't we just have none of that I (58:06 - 58:10)
was like yeah I guess you could also (58:08 - 58:13)
have none of that in basic you can have (58:10 - 58:15)
three Pokemon in a wonder box and (58:13 - 58:19)
premium you can have ten in basic you (58:15 - 58:21)
could have one Pokemon in the GTS (58:19 - 58:25)
premium you can have three in basic you (58:21 - 58:27)
can participate in room trades in (58:25 - 58:30)
premium you can participate and host (58:27 - 58:33)
room trades and then in basic you cannot (58:30 - 58:35)
access the judge in premium you can (58:33 - 58:37)
access the judge again you're just (58:35 - 58:39)
paying for convenience there you can (58:37 - 58:41)
still access the judge normally and (58:39 - 58:43)
sword and shield once you go through (58:41 - 58:46)
your six battles in a battle tower now (58:43 - 58:49)
that I saw some people were upset about (58:46 - 58:50)
the judge thing being behind a paywall (58:49 - 58:54)
but sign up for any podcast service you (58:50 - 58:56)
what you want stats that's an extra two (58:54 - 58:57)
bucks (58:56 - 58:59)
you want some premium stats that's an (58:57 - 59:01)
extra five bucks like it's literally (58:59 - 59:04)
just data they hide behind like this the (59:01 - 59:06)
Pokemon company is not the first (59:04 - 59:08)
corporation out there to hide a step (59:06 - 59:12)
behind the paywall it's goes far beyond (59:08 - 59:16)
that and my one example of podcasting I (59:12 - 59:18)
don't think the GTS is as big as the (59:16 - 59:21)
deal as you're making it Greg (59:18 - 59:21)
I'm just not that big of a deal I'm just (59:21 - 59:27)
saying I'm just saying when people want (59:23 - 59:30)
big deal to me Greg I am a big deal but (59:27 - 59:31)
no I'm saying when people look at the (59:30 - 59:35)
pricing when they see things are blocked (59:31 - 59:38)
off that is where that complaint sure (59:35 - 59:40)
when they see you get when they see you (59:38 - 59:42)
get something more and having to pay for (59:40 - 59:45)
it it doesn't matter that the basic is (59:42 - 59:47)
what you used to get there is still the (59:45 - 59:52)
perception and the FOMO of what I want (59:47 - 59:54)
that and I have to pay a lot of money (59:52 - 59:57)
for it on top of everything else one a (59:54 - 59:59)
one in the GTS is what it used to be is (59:57 - 60:02)
fine it you probably won't ever use it (59:59 - 60:04)
but the fact that there are functions of (60:02 - 60:07)
these things locked behind premium (60:04 - 60:12)
creates a feeling of I have to pay to (60:07 - 60:15)
get full access and that leaves a sour (60:12 - 60:18)
taste in people's mouth I think like the (60:15 - 60:22)
GCS shouldn't have had like (60:18 - 60:25)
extra leave that I just leave it the way (60:22 - 60:29)
it was because it used to exist before I (60:25 - 60:32)
yeah and and it would have helped that (60:29 - 60:35)
perception some but it's not a big deal (60:32 - 60:37)
like I'm not actually upset about it I'm (60:35 - 60:40)
just saying that that that that that (60:37 - 60:43)
feeds into the view of things being (60:40 - 60:45)
locked away from people which isn't (60:43 - 60:48)
helpful and the pricing is it is (60:45 - 60:52)
expensive like it is an upper limit of (60:48 - 60:54)
what I think they could get away with I (60:52 - 60:56)
think it's slightly overpriced but not (60:54 - 60:59)
outrageously enough to stop a lot of (60:56 - 61:01)
people paying for it it just it feels (60:59 - 61:04)
like oof that's a lot of money for what (61:01 - 61:06)
am I really gonna use it for well okay (61:04 - 61:09)
so if Pokemon bank was five dollars for (61:06 - 61:11)
ultimately all you got was three (61:09 - 61:15)
thousand spaces that was it so at ten (61:11 - 61:18)
dollars you're getting double that which (61:15 - 61:20)
I think in that if we're only looking at (61:18 - 61:23)
those two variables I'm sure there's one (61:20 - 61:25)
person listening being like well I they (61:23 - 61:28)
didn't get my five other people who (61:25 - 61:30)
thought that was overpriced there are (61:28 - 61:31)
always you people who thought that was (61:30 - 61:33)
overpriced but for me the five dollars (61:31 - 61:35)
for three thousand was awesome (61:33 - 61:38)
since day one you know even if you were (61:35 - 61:40)
to go back in this podcast like six (61:38 - 61:42)
years ago like eight years ago when I (61:40 - 61:43)
was like the only thing I really wanted (61:42 - 61:44)
out of Pokemon it's like a cloud (61:43 - 61:46)
solution where I can put all my Pokemon (61:44 - 61:48)
some sick of transferring them from game (61:46 - 61:51)
to game and shooting arrows so five (61:48 - 61:53)
dollars a year gets you three thousand (61:51 - 61:55)
spaces if we were to double that to $10 (61:53 - 61:56)
zero that gives you six thousand spaces (61:55 - 61:59)
and there were fans including myself (61:56 - 62:01)
that was like three thousand ain't (61:59 - 62:04)
cutting it anymore especially with (62:01 - 62:06)
Pokemon go being something that we know (62:04 - 62:08)
is going to transfer in because I'm (62:06 - 62:10)
almost at three thousand alone in (62:08 - 62:12)
Pokemon go and I need to dump those (62:10 - 62:15)
Pokemon somewhere so is then the $6 so (62:12 - 62:17)
let's just pretend everyone was ok with (62:15 - 62:17)
that (62:17 - 62:18)
I don't know if everyone is ok with that (62:17 - 62:20)
but I think that's a fair assessment (62:18 - 62:22)
based on the history of last 7 years (62:20 - 62:24)
double the space double the money devil (62:22 - 62:25)
space double the money fine so what is (62:24 - 62:29)
that extra $6 get you you could argue (62:25 - 62:30)
the judge function so you can check (62:29 - 62:32)
without actually moving it into a game (62:30 - 62:34)
the judge function became incredibly (62:32 - 62:36)
easy once Sun and Moon came out it (62:34 - 62:38)
still a pain in the butt in X&Y where (62:36 - 62:39)
you had to talk to a specific person and (62:38 - 62:41)
they were still very vague about it so (62:39 - 62:44)
judge function has been good since Sun (62:41 - 62:45)
and Moon let's go (62:44 - 62:49)
sword and shield that's an one extra (62:45 - 62:51)
step you don't need to do if they add (62:49 - 62:53)
the judge function there but on top of (62:51 - 62:55)
that they've also added a mobile app so (62:53 - 62:57)
you could maybe argue that the fact that (62:55 - 62:59)
you can now see this on your phone or (62:57 - 63:02)
your iPad or your or whatever is the (62:59 - 63:06)
extra six dollars the difference is here (63:02 - 63:07)
between the Nintendo search and the (63:06 - 63:09)
phone version the Nintendo switch will (63:07 - 63:11)
let you move Pokemon the Nintendo switch (63:09 - 63:13)
will let you move Pokemon between let's (63:11 - 63:14)
go Pikachu let's go Eevee and sword and (63:13 - 63:16)
shield you can not do that using the (63:14 - 63:17)
phone (63:16 - 63:20)
both the Nintendo switch and the mobile (63:17 - 63:21)
phone version will let you access and (63:20 - 63:24)
move from Pokemon Bank which is (63:21 - 63:27)
interesting and don't know what that (63:24 - 63:30)
means exactly but okay the judge (63:27 - 63:32)
function will be accessible through both (63:30 - 63:35)
if you decide to pay for that you cannot (63:32 - 63:38)
trade Pokemon from Pokemon home from the (63:35 - 63:41)
switch itself you can from the mobile (63:38 - 63:43)
version I guess this makes sense because (63:41 - 63:45)
they want you to do it in the actual (63:43 - 63:47)
game so that's fine I guess I don't know (63:45 - 63:50)
if that's like a technical issue or they (63:47 - 63:51)
just want you to go back to the game (63:50 - 63:54)
yeah I don't know that's weird (63:51 - 63:56)
they they probably just like with all (63:54 - 63:57)
the things that they had to program for (63:56 - 63:59)
this they were like that functionality (63:57 - 64:00)
already exists on the switch let's not (63:59 - 64:03)
prioritize doing that on the switch and (64:00 - 64:05)
it's probably to future-proof of like (64:03 - 64:09)
yeah hey and we want the trading will (64:05 - 64:11)
probably be different in other games (64:09 - 64:13)
going forward after certain shields so (64:11 - 64:17)
we don't want to fine you cannot receive (64:13 - 64:19)
mystery gifts via this Nintendo switch (64:17 - 64:21)
version but you can on the mobile (64:19 - 64:23)
version again that's weird but also they (64:21 - 64:24)
probably want you to use the mystery (64:23 - 64:26)
gift function and sword and shield (64:24 - 64:29)
specifically so I program it again (64:26 - 64:31)
you cannot check battle data on the (64:29 - 64:33)
Nintendo switch version but you can on (64:31 - 64:36)
the phone no news at Linda tempo search (64:33 - 64:38)
version but you can on the phone there's (64:36 - 64:41)
an already a news program on the switch (64:38 - 64:44)
that no one ever checks so I don't sure (64:41 - 64:46)
and then on the descendants which (64:44 - 64:48)
version you can exchange home points for (64:46 - 64:51)
battle points you can not do that on the (64:48 - 64:54)
phone so that all makes sense I'd be (64:51 - 64:57)
curious if they did like them if they (64:54 - 64:58)
were going to do a middle tier plan of (64:57 - 65:02)
like hey this is just Pokemon bank for (64:58 - 65:04)
the switch no phone version and make it (65:02 - 65:06)
cheaper because I think that's maybe (65:04 - 65:08)
where some people are getting held up of (65:06 - 65:13)
why it's I do think 16 is up is high I (65:08 - 65:15)
don't have any problem paying for it (65:13 - 65:17)
because yeah Pokemon is like my number (65:15 - 65:21)
one game in life you know when I mean (65:17 - 65:23)
I don't have problem paying for it I do (65:21 - 65:25)
think it is the very upper limit of what (65:23 - 65:27)
the kick it away with I just don't (65:25 - 65:29)
understand why it's not 15 it's just so (65:27 - 65:31)
weird odor (65:29 - 65:33)
but what if there was yeah if there was (65:31 - 65:36)
maybe like $10 a year and it was just (65:33 - 65:38)
here's everything here's the six (65:36 - 65:40)
thousand spots here's the switch but you (65:38 - 65:42)
don't get access to that phone version (65:40 - 65:45)
because I'm actually I think that's (65:42 - 65:48)
that's such a big selling point to me is (65:45 - 65:50)
having everything on my phone and being (65:48 - 65:53)
able to trade from my phone like I think (65:50 - 65:57)
that in itself was worth the $6 and I (65:53 - 65:58)
think double the space to me was worth (65:57 - 66:00)
the $10 and that's why I don't think I'm (65:58 - 66:02)
in Terra entirely mad about the entire (66:00 - 66:05)
thing I just don't know if the trading (66:02 - 66:06)
function (66:05 - 66:11)
is worth $6 I just don't know trading (66:06 - 66:12)
from your phone you mean sorry (66:11 - 66:14)
yeah training from my phone is I (66:12 - 66:17)
honestly think the whole the whole (66:14 - 66:19)
mobile phone aspect of it is going to be (66:17 - 66:22)
so new to us it's really hard to judge (66:19 - 66:26)
how we're going to pay functionality (66:22 - 66:31)
whatever but it's like we can't really (66:26 - 66:32)
judge how we're gonna feel about the (66:31 - 66:34)
mobile phone functionality until we have (66:32 - 66:36)
it in our hands right and we either say (66:34 - 66:40)
wow this was done super fantastic it is (66:36 - 66:43)
worth every penny or wow I can't believe (66:40 - 66:46)
they consider this to be a mobile app (66:43 - 66:50)
right yeah 2020 I mean like see the (66:46 - 66:51)
honestly you're ever gonna use the (66:50 - 66:54)
wonder box no are you ever gonna use the (66:51 - 66:59)
GTS maybe so I was very against GTS and (66:54 - 67:01)
sword and shield specifically because (66:59 - 67:05)
sorry I'm Sun and Moon specifically (67:01 - 67:08)
because I I like catching pokémon myself (67:05 - 67:12)
so there's very there's never a (67:08 - 67:13)
situation where I'm like I'm missing a (67:12 - 67:16)
Pokemon I need to go to the GTS but the (67:13 - 67:20)
GTS did help me out a lot in trading my (67:16 - 67:21)
Pokemon that I bred to people who watch (67:20 - 67:23)
my twitch stream yeah and then you throw (67:21 - 67:26)
away their Pokemon right well that's (67:23 - 67:28)
still a problem I have with the game (67:26 - 67:29)
where you have to trade a Pokemon for a (67:28 - 67:32)
Pokemon but if I was like trading own (67:29 - 67:34)
tempo rock rough which you cannot wonder (67:32 - 67:37)
trade which we'll find out once this (67:34 - 67:40)
goes up if if that'll be able to be (67:37 - 67:41)
Wonder trade so own tempo rock rough you (67:40 - 67:43)
can't wonder trade you can only you can (67:41 - 67:45)
GTS it though so I was breeding own (67:43 - 67:47)
tempo rock rough for people who watch my (67:45 - 67:50)
twitch stream you know I got egg moves (67:47 - 67:52)
on it I got good Ivy's on it I got it in (67:50 - 67:55)
a moon ball and so all they had to do (67:52 - 67:57)
was upload baska lens to the GTS and (67:55 - 68:01)
then ask for rock roughs under level 5 (67:57 - 68:04)
and I was able to find them find their (68:01 - 68:05)
masculine 's they named their bass (68:04 - 68:07)
colognes is C and boom I could trade (68:05 - 68:08)
them they didn't have to worry about (68:07 - 68:10)
waiting they could just put on the GTS (68:08 - 68:12)
come like go get dinner come back and (68:10 - 68:13)
when they came back they got a rock (68:12 - 68:16)
rough is impossible for me to do this in (68:13 - 68:18)
sort and shield which is like a streamer (68:16 - 68:20)
complaint of like sure a total (68:18 - 68:22)
understand so I'm so I might be able to (68:20 - 68:25)
benefit from GTS here even though that (68:22 - 68:27)
was something like oh I I don't care (68:25 - 68:29)
about the GTS some people were very (68:27 - 68:32)
excited GTS what came back but if this (68:29 - 68:37)
is a way for me to breed 30 gallery' and (68:32 - 68:40)
courses move them into Pokemon home (68:37 - 68:42)
switch over to home search for bass : (68:40 - 68:46)
named is sea level 20 they're asking for (68:42 - 68:48)
glare in corsola under 1 and I can just (68:46 - 68:51)
do trades that's awesome but I don't (68:48 - 68:53)
like that was never a selling point to (68:51 - 68:56)
Pokemon home for me and so room trades (68:53 - 68:59)
look what they're presenting you enter (68:56 - 69:02)
in a room and then (68:59 - 69:04)
basically a wonder trade happens amongst (69:02 - 69:08)
the people that you know yeah that's (69:04 - 69:12)
fine fun like it seems like a gimmick (69:08 - 69:14)
that most people would use once and then (69:12 - 69:16)
never again like you know we're going to (69:14 - 69:19)
make it a tradition at Minnesota Sunday (69:16 - 69:21)
brunch is we're gonna do room trades if (69:19 - 69:23)
it was an action if it was like the (69:21 - 69:25)
black and white diamond pearl room where (69:23 - 69:27)
you walk in and you see the other people (69:25 - 69:29)
and you could walk up and instantly (69:27 - 69:33)
instigate a trade there it's not that (69:29 - 69:37)
would be cool and I would say would have (69:33 - 69:39)
a value to it but if it's just a menu (69:37 - 69:44)
that shows 20 names yeah sure there's (69:39 - 69:45)
nothing in here showing that you're (69:44 - 69:48)
walking around a room no like it is just (69:45 - 69:49)
literally 20 people in a room and then (69:48 - 69:52)
you randomize so I think and this is (69:49 - 69:55)
where I think people are getting caught (69:52 - 69:57)
up on (69:55 - 69:59)
the features and the money because like (69:57 - 70:01)
you alone you would never use wonder hey (69:59 - 70:02)
because you don't like that controlled (70:01 - 70:05)
you use GCS in a very specific so he's (70:02 - 70:08)
like wonder trading tape pocus I mean I (70:05 - 70:10)
do I wonder trade all the time yeah but (70:08 - 70:14)
I empty out those boxes out the boxes (70:10 - 70:16)
you're getting garbage before garbage (70:14 - 70:20)
back it's how I'm getting a ton of (70:16 - 70:22)
foreign Pokemon firm Masuda method like (70:20 - 70:25)
there are digit rate but like if you (70:22 - 70:27)
like for people for you the two main (70:25 - 70:28)
things are getting out of trade is (70:27 - 70:31)
sometimes UTS and easy French right on (70:28 - 70:33)
your mobile I think people are valid (70:31 - 70:36)
looking at that saying is that worth six (70:33 - 70:39)
dollars okay so they did say the judge (70:36 - 70:42)
right but the judge can be done in any (70:39 - 70:43)
game which used to be for free so (70:42 - 70:46)
they're minions there yet there is a (70:43 - 70:50)
there is also people don't look at oh (70:46 - 70:51)
I'm paying for convenience they're (70:50 - 70:53)
looking at I have to pay for something (70:51 - 70:56)
that I was getting for free elsewhere so (70:53 - 70:58)
there's two sides of that you see it as (70:56 - 71:00)
hey I have it conveniently here other (70:58 - 71:02)
people say hey I get it free here here (71:00 - 71:03)
and here (71:02 - 71:05)
why do I have to pay for it here there's (71:03 - 71:07)
things we don't know about Bank our (71:05 - 71:09)
sorry home we don't know if it auto (71:07 - 71:13)
sorts right if it doesn't auto start I (71:09 - 71:16)
am I don't know what I'm going to the (71:13 - 71:19)
Pokemon bank it never artist auto so (71:16 - 71:21)
let's go Pikachu let's go Eevee Auto (71:19 - 71:25)
sorted Pokemon go Auto sorts so they (71:21 - 71:27)
didn't show Auto sword it's not in there (71:25 - 71:32)
for like plans can auto cert if it auto (71:27 - 71:36)
sorts that's worth it to me that's worth (71:32 - 71:39)
some money to me again i I did sort my (71:36 - 71:43)
400 Pokemon show did I over for days and (71:39 - 71:45)
it took me four days to it took me two (71:43 - 71:49)
hours every day for four days i watch a (71:45 - 71:54)
lot of wrestling that weekend and the (71:49 - 71:58)
reason I never sorted in Pokemon bank is (71:54 - 72:00)
because I was like that's gonna come one (71:58 - 72:06)
day it never came so if it's sorts I (72:00 - 72:09)
think that's such a dumb feature but I (72:06 - 72:10)
think that's worth yeah (72:09 - 72:13)
if it lets you mass release again there (72:10 - 72:16)
are probably people that would pay for (72:13 - 72:20)
mass releasing the thing that really (72:16 - 72:22)
drove me crazy about Pokemon bank and I (72:20 - 72:24)
don't know this for sure but it seems (72:22 - 72:25)
very likely and they didn't talk about (72:24 - 72:27)
it is in Pokemon bank you cannot change (72:25 - 72:30)
the markings and I use the markings to (72:27 - 72:33)
search so for example I will mark all my (72:30 - 72:36)
shinies as stars okay we I'm the the (72:33 - 72:38)
marking thing people need to use it (72:36 - 72:43)
better look you can you can use markings (72:38 - 72:45)
however you want but if you're using (72:43 - 72:48)
markings for IVs you're a boomer you're (72:45 - 72:50)
stuck in your old ways and you need to (72:48 - 72:54)
get out of that that is a valid way to (72:50 - 72:57)
mark no it's not because we had the (72:54 - 73:01)
judge you don't need to mark anymore you (72:57 - 73:04)
have the judge function you just how do (73:01 - 73:06)
I remember which if my Joel tix is the (73:04 - 73:08)
one that had the good IVs then you mark (73:06 - 73:10)
and then you use one shape to mark that (73:08 - 73:13)
that has good IVs you don't need to mark (73:10 - 73:17)
every single shape in order in order to (73:13 - 73:21)
know that it's marking so I like I like (73:17 - 73:23)
classifying and categorizing my pokum (73:21 - 73:25)
and I'm helping you do that better no (73:23 - 73:29)
you are yes yes okay yes not better (73:25 - 73:33)
my way is significantly better okay here (73:29 - 73:34)
we go is it bad I'm gonna break it down (73:33 - 73:37)
for you so if you use markings so we're (73:34 - 73:39)
talking about the circle triangle square (73:37 - 73:41)
heart star diamond those are the six (73:39 - 73:43)
markings there's actually 12 markers (73:41 - 73:45)
shoes because you can change it from (73:43 - 73:47)
blue to red the old way of doing things (73:45 - 73:51)
is they would mark circle for HP or (73:47 - 73:54)
whatever triangle for attack square for (73:51 - 73:57)
defense but that is such a useless thing (73:54 - 74:02)
ever since Sun and Moon because you can (73:57 - 74:04)
press the star you could you could just (74:02 - 74:07)
go to your box (74:04 - 74:10)
that why it wasn't why on the 3ds and (74:07 - 74:12)
then you could see best best best very (74:10 - 74:14)
good best best best provided you unlock (74:12 - 74:16)
that yes yes (74:14 - 74:17)
and then in sword and shield you just (74:16 - 74:20)
press the plus button twice or whatever (74:17 - 74:23)
provided you unlock that and in Pokemon (74:20 - 74:26)
home if you're paying the money if you (74:23 - 74:29)
go behind the paywall you press the plus (74:26 - 74:32)
button twice and then let's go Pikachu (74:29 - 74:33)
let's go Eevee again if you press the Y (74:32 - 74:36)
button you see the best best best best (74:33 - 74:40)
best let's say you have three thousand (74:36 - 74:44)
Pokemon where are your Chinese you have (74:40 - 74:46)
no clue where they are they could all be (74:44 - 74:48)
like I have a box called Chinese right (74:46 - 74:50)
in that box let's say you move a shiny (74:48 - 74:53)
out for a competition where is it now is (74:50 - 74:55)
it is it in the battle box is it in your (74:53 - 74:58)
PC is it in your Pokemon Bank where is (74:55 - 75:00)
it if you mark your Chinese using the (74:58 - 75:02)
star then you can just go into the (75:00 - 75:04)
search feature say I want to search by (75:02 - 75:07)
star specifically instead of finding (75:04 - 75:10)
your Pokemon with a highs special (75:07 - 75:11)
defense which is normally what people (75:10 - 75:13)
would mark star you can instantly see (75:11 - 75:16)
where all your shinies are at all times (75:13 - 75:17)
as soon as you catch a shiny market a (75:16 - 75:19)
star now for all those people that are (75:17 - 75:21)
like what if I what if this has perfect (75:19 - 75:24)
Ivy's mark it as a diamond now all you (75:21 - 75:26)
have to do is go into your bank search (75:24 - 75:29)
for diamond oh look here are all my (75:26 - 75:31)
perfect Ivy Diamond Pokemon throughout (75:29 - 75:33)
all my boxes I can quickly now organize (75:31 - 75:34)
them (75:33 - 75:36)
hey did I take the time to Eevee train (75:34 - 75:38)
this Pokemon how would I search for that (75:36 - 75:42)
I have eight perfect diamond or in this (75:38 - 75:44)
case everyone marks everything as (75:42 - 75:47)
everything I which one of these con (75:44 - 75:49)
kaldur's did I actually Evie trained (75:47 - 75:51)
well mark him as a heart hey which which (75:49 - 75:53)
one of these Pokemon came from events I (75:51 - 75:55)
got eight what is this is this shiny (75:53 - 75:57)
Gyarados the one I caught in heartgold (75:55 - 75:59)
SoulSilver is this where's the shiny (75:57 - 76:02)
Gyarados that I caught in a in a cherish (75:59 - 76:05)
ball Markham has a circle she my problem (76:02 - 76:07)
with the whole shiny thing is why can't (76:05 - 76:09)
they just do it like pokemon go where (76:07 - 76:11)
the search for shiny yeah well and it (76:09 - 76:13)
brings me my Chinese look once they do (76:11 - 76:15)
that then then that'll make it easier (76:13 - 76:18)
but like you are if you're if you're (76:15 - 76:21)
just using all the markings just for I (76:18 - 76:24)
one it's a waste because there's a way (76:21 - 76:26)
to look at your IVs very quickly now and (76:24 - 76:29)
to you like there are so many other (76:26 - 76:32)
instances instances to search for your (76:29 - 76:35)
Pokemon there's so many other is is that (76:32 - 76:36)
you search for your poco but like don't (76:35 - 76:38)
you want to search for your specific (76:36 - 76:41)
event Pokemon or like no you could mark (76:38 - 76:43)
no I use I use a triangle to mark that (76:41 - 76:45)
this Pokemon is foreign hey I have I (76:43 - 76:48)
have forty scrag ease which one was that (76:45 - 76:50)
Japanese Greggy so I can Masuda oh I (76:48 - 76:52)
could just search by triangle and now I (76:50 - 76:55)
can find all nah I'm gonna talk right (76:52 - 76:57)
there I might forget about are there in (76:55 - 77:00)
my box that says foreign okay so you can (76:57 - 77:02)
name boxes certain things but that (77:00 - 77:04)
doesn't mean that Pokemon doesn't ever (77:02 - 77:06)
leave that box and go somewhere else to (77:04 - 77:09)
do something it stays in there what am I (77:06 - 77:11)
gonna use it for get out to either breed (77:09 - 77:14)
it or Eevee train it or come use it for (77:11 - 77:17)
competitive and then I'm gonna put it (77:14 - 77:21)
back in its box okay look no one does (77:17 - 77:24)
this we're all lazy I'll forget you (77:21 - 77:26)
don't do it you don't do it separately (77:24 - 77:28)
were sitting here saying that we have to (77:26 - 77:30)
take all the extra step to come up with (77:28 - 77:33)
the key for each of your marking that I (77:30 - 77:35)
can break our system so and then you're (77:33 - 77:37)
like it's so much easier if I search by (77:35 - 77:40)
however I set my key up because I (77:37 - 77:41)
whatever you want (77:40 - 77:43)
I won't set them back in the box that I (77:41 - 77:45)
created for them for the two seconds it (77:43 - 77:48)
takes me to do that right in the moment (77:45 - 77:50)
I think they should just remove markings (77:48 - 77:55)
altogether I think that that second (77:50 - 77:57)
underused and underappreciated and kind (77:55 - 77:59)
of valueless no it is it is underused (77:57 - 78:01)
because everyone's using it for IVs (77:59 - 78:03)
which is the negative when you can just (78:01 - 78:06)
name boxes wrong wait what are you (78:03 - 78:09)
naming your boxes at this point shiny (78:06 - 78:13)
pokemon battle teams cute polka Morgan (78:09 - 78:14)
what if you have a shiny pokemon that is (78:13 - 78:16)
battle ready which box do you put it in (78:14 - 78:19)
will which box do you no no no no no I (78:16 - 78:21)
take that one and I breed it until it (78:19 - 78:24)
has a battle ready youth and then I use (78:21 - 78:26)
the youth one for battles and put that (78:24 - 78:28)
one back in the shiny box Mike Chinese (78:26 - 78:30)
are far too precious to throw out into (78:28 - 78:32)
battle so carelessly (78:30 - 78:35)
I'm trying to help people out Greg yes (78:32 - 78:40)
stomping on my markings you you can (78:35 - 78:44)
offer up your method of how you mark and (78:40 - 78:47)
say this is how I do it feel free to (78:44 - 78:49)
join me (78:47 - 78:53)
or not feel free to join okay but in (78:49 - 78:56)
Pokemon bank you couldn't edit markings (78:53 - 78:59)
and it frames like in Pokemon home you (78:56 - 79:03)
can do that what (78:59 - 79:05)
based on the screen trip all right all (79:03 - 79:07)
of a sudden it's very $15.00 where are (79:05 - 79:08)
you seeing that which screenshots (79:07 - 79:11)
telling you that also for those that (79:08 - 79:13)
want to know hi mark Giganta max Pokemon (79:11 - 79:15)
I mark my circle I'm art I used the (79:13 - 79:19)
circle mark event Pokemon just making an (79:15 - 79:20)
infographic Abid my wand (79:19 - 79:28)
I was the red circle thing already we (79:20 - 79:31)
have covered everything I think okay so (79:28 - 79:35)
if you go to screenshot 30 JPEG you can (79:31 - 79:39)
see the name the gender the level the (79:35 - 79:42)
type the fact that it's in Pokemon home (79:39 - 79:45)
and then the language is Japan and then (79:42 - 79:47)
you see the sword and shield symbol and (79:45 - 79:49)
the next to that you see all the (79:47 - 79:51)
markings and they're hovering over a (79:49 - 79:52)
Pikachu (79:51 - 79:57)
yeah and they know ugochi chapter 31 you (79:52 - 80:00)
can see the markings again it's true it (79:57 - 80:02)
doesn't mean you can change them if you (80:00 - 80:02)
can't change them (80:02 - 80:05)
I want my sixteen dollars back all right (80:02 - 80:10)
see value-add 30 home points equals one (80:05 - 80:12)
battle point (80:10 - 80:15)
wow that's a bad exchange what we don't (80:12 - 80:17)
know how much how many home points you (80:15 - 80:25)
get you get one home point a month I'm (80:17 - 80:28)
excited for home ok I will state I am (80:25 - 80:32)
excited for home I do I again much like (80:28 - 80:35)
the DLC I think we're really we're (80:32 - 80:38)
really pushing the pricing and I'm (80:35 - 80:40)
really hoping that it's worth it and (80:38 - 80:44)
that it stays going forward as a worth (80:40 - 80:47)
it prospect I'm really hoping that it (80:44 - 80:49)
they don't do what a million other (80:47 - 80:51)
companies do which is knock it out of (80:49 - 80:52)
the park the first time and get (80:51 - 80:54)
everybody used to the price and then (80:52 - 80:57)
slowly stop delivering but keeping it at (80:54 - 81:00)
the same price which happens way too (80:57 - 81:02)
often I'm excited with the reservations (81:00 - 81:03)
and not just leave it at that (81:02 - 81:06)
sir eventually adding Pokemon go support (81:03 - 81:13)
so maybe they will 2025 something else (81:06 - 81:17)
that I don't know uh yeah I'm I'm I'm (81:13 - 81:19)
excited now but if it's if this is going (81:17 - 81:21)
to come into a Pokemon make situation (81:19 - 81:22)
where they don't they they're like here (81:21 - 81:25)

[Music] (81:38 - 81:48)
February events to make your heart (81:46 - 81:53)
flutter will I have no heart so now what (81:48 - 81:56)
are you gonna do trainers will be still (81:53 - 82:01)
your heart this is how it opens look (81:56 - 82:04)
where I used to have a heart is now an (82:01 - 82:08)
empty void so stillness is yes the de (82:04 - 82:10)
facto state it's a lot happening in (82:08 - 82:12)
February there's seven things here I'm (82:10 - 82:14)
gonna try to break it down as quickly as (82:12 - 82:19)
possible number one is if you decide to (82:14 - 82:21)
do the Team Rocket special research and (82:19 - 82:24)
you get to Giovanni this month it is (82:21 - 82:24)
shadow (82:24 - 82:28)
Reiko which will leave at the end of (82:24 - 82:28)
February (82:28 - 82:30)
you could probably safely assume it's (82:28 - 82:33)
going to be sweet tune orente the (82:30 - 82:36)
following and then the month after will (82:33 - 82:40)
be the other one so if you care about (82:36 - 82:43)
that I don't know our people I'm sure (82:40 - 82:44)
somebody out there is doing Giovanni (82:43 - 82:46)
every single month I haven't done - (82:44 - 82:49)
Yvonne yet I'm only funny at all - (82:46 - 82:52)
Giovanni I've done the three that have (82:49 - 82:54)
to do six more and then I can do (82:52 - 82:57)
Giovanni I guess I'll try four right I (82:54 - 83:00)
like Rocco he's alright it's a good dog (82:57 - 83:02)
it's a good tiger (83:00 - 83:07)
yeah the tiger dog tiger like creature (83:02 - 83:12)
what they say dog like Pokemon exactly (83:07 - 83:15)
February search breakthrough Lapras is (83:12 - 83:17)
done they did Lapras all through January (83:15 - 83:21)
this month it will be woo bat and you (83:17 - 83:24)
will get bonus woo bat candy my (83:21 - 83:27)
assumption is because whoa bat has the (83:24 - 83:30)
heart knows that's why they did will bat (83:27 - 83:32)
I would agree with you but smoo bat also (83:30 - 83:36)
has a heart now yes yeah yeah he Tran (83:32 - 83:38)
will be leaving the bachelor party is (83:36 - 83:41)
over bachelor party's been over a long (83:38 - 83:46)
time tornadoes the cyclone Pokemon will (83:41 - 83:50)
be in five star raids the Pokemon go (83:46 - 83:52)
community has already dubbed this as Dex (83:50 - 83:54)
filler which is the opposite of how (83:52 - 83:58)
tornadoes was received in both the TCG (83:54 - 84:02)
and in VGC competitive horn a tassel is (83:58 - 84:04)
very very good in the trading card game (84:02 - 84:07)
tornado is the only mono flying-type (84:04 - 84:09)
pokémon as far as I recall most they've (84:07 - 84:10)
added one (84:09 - 84:15)
rickety rackety Oh comes into play here (84:10 - 84:17)
these no tornados friend tornadoes could (84:15 - 84:20)
do the dog is terminated TCG it was it (84:17 - 84:22)
was a donk it was a card that could do (84:20 - 84:25)
the donk do we think tornado says in her (84:22 - 84:27)
in Pokemon go like it's rude everything (84:25 - 84:31)
else no no I think it's slanderous oh (84:27 - 84:35)
maybe Landorus for fighting but no it (84:31 - 84:37)
doesn't seem like tornadoes is (84:35 - 84:39)
specifically good for Pokemon go (84:37 - 84:41)
tornadoes really benefited from (84:39 - 84:46)
prankster the pranks durability in BGC (84:41 - 84:48)
so that'll be around for a month it (84:46 - 84:50)
starts on Tuesday February 4th it will (84:48 - 84:54)
actually end February 25th (84:50 - 84:56)
two days before Pokemon days so there's (84:54 - 84:58)
probably there's probably a reason for (84:56 - 85:01)
that I'm assuming there will be a sinnoh (84:58 - 85:03)
region celebration event which obviously (85:01 - 85:07)
means that remakes important for (85:03 - 85:10)
confirmed yes you heard it here from us (85:07 - 85:14)
first there's an insert sarcasm if you (85:10 - 85:18)
did not detect that February 7th through (85:14 - 85:20)
February 10th Pokemon originally (85:18 - 85:21)
discovered in the sinnoh region will (85:20 - 85:23)
appear more often in the wild and raids (85:21 - 85:27)
all the 7k eggs will feature Pokemon (85:23 - 85:31)
from this inner region including there's (85:27 - 85:33)
a there's not a lot of winners in here (85:31 - 85:38)
but do Combee bronze or gibble riolu (85:33 - 85:42)
hippo pitous and man tyke I can get a (85:38 - 85:43)
shiny buddy (85:42 - 85:45)
you could you could maybe finally get a (85:43 - 85:48)
gibble I heard them rubbing everybody (85:45 - 85:51)
shiny Brazilian my face I heard the real (85:48 - 85:53)
game doesn't begin until you get a (85:51 - 85:55)
gibble it used to be until you got level (85:53 - 85:58)
40 but now you're not a true Pokemon (85:55 - 86:00)
girl player unless you have gibble or (85:58 - 86:02)
maybe it's axe you now it's actually now (86:00 - 86:04)
I think Gibble's still pretty hard to (86:02 - 86:06)
find though event-specific field (86:04 - 86:08)
research will award you with Encounters (86:06 - 86:09)
of Pokemon that were originally (86:08 - 86:11)
discovered in the recent region as well (86:09 - 86:16)
see no stones and last but not least if (86:11 - 86:20)
you're lucky you may encounter a shiny (86:16 - 86:25)
riolu or a shiny hippo put toss what (86:20 - 86:27)
about a shiny buddy that's already shiny (86:25 - 86:30)

interesting if they release kakeland but (92:20 - 92:27)

is born (93:34 - 93:37)
maybe it's Moo (93:35 - 93:41)
I maybe I guess I guess they could do (93:37 - 93:44)
that you're right it will probably be me (93:41 - 93:47)
too which is boring but I'm hoping it's (93:44 - 93:49)
not oh why didn't wear interesting what (93:47 - 93:51)
if instead of kecleon they give us duck (93:49 - 93:54)
'let duck let's way cooler than kecleon (93:51 - 93:57)
very true yeah or analytic but or (93:54 - 94:02)

time left (94:17 - 94:19)
yeah but duck lets cooler than Deerling (94:17 - 94:22)

Solana dice wanna know Garbo (94:22 - 94:30)

larva Stu candy well then you gotta walk (94:40 - 94:46)
with it or use up your debuff prayer (94:43 - 94:48)
candies there you go there's all the (94:46 - 94:52)
pokemon go February news literally (94:48 - 94:56)
events after events I guess that's good (94:52 - 94:58)
though I guess I have to do that (94:56 - 95:01)
honestly cuz like (94:58 - 95:02)
well you gotta keep the money train (95:01 - 95:07)
going yep but also it's like the MMO (95:02 - 95:09)
thing of you got to keep giving them (95:07 - 95:11)
content otherwise they're gonna find a (95:09 - 95:14)
different game to go to can't slow down (95:11 - 95:15)
otherwise they'll know there's other (95:14 - 95:19)
mmo's out there and there are not a lot (95:15 - 95:21)
that are good but there are a bunch of (95:19 - 95:23)
them out there like well I mean we all (95:21 - 95:25)
know when world warcraft players get (95:23 - 95:28)
bored they start experimenting with us (95:25 - 95:31)
that's true and like something what (95:28 - 95:34)
happened to you Greg oh no wow wow it (95:31 - 95:36)
made me actively angry Oh (95:34 - 95:40)
Thailand go ah we don't have to spend a (95:36 - 95:42)
lot of time on this but go battle league (95:40 - 95:46)
it came rolling out you have to walk to (95:42 - 95:50)
do it that that's been Heatley Heatley (95:46 - 95:53)
today that debated Healey it's been he (95:50 - 95:55)
trained you debated the he trains were a (95:53 - 95:58)
very upset you can unlock pichu libre (95:55 - 96:03)
avatar items by participating you know (95:58 - 96:04)
I'm gonna be honest with you I did my (96:03 - 96:06)
free five matches and I actually had a (96:04 - 96:08)
pretty okay time with it I think mostly (96:06 - 96:11)
because I didn't really know what it is (96:08 - 96:14)
whoa okay so sure so they moved the (96:11 - 96:17)
battle tab so in and if you want to (96:14 - 96:19)
battle like Ken D'Elia or stuff can (96:17 - 96:23)
Delia spark sure sure they they took (96:19 - 96:26)
that out of the nearby which was a weird (96:23 - 96:28)
place for it anyways yeah it was a weird (96:26 - 96:29)
place when somebody hit the pokeball (96:28 - 96:32)
there's not a battle tab and then in (96:29 - 96:34)
there it keeps track of how many wins (96:32 - 96:35)
you have how many battles you've done (96:34 - 96:38)
your streak Stardust earned and you can (96:35 - 96:41)
go up a ladder and the season will reset (96:38 - 96:43)
I think this season here resets March (96:41 - 96:47)
31st and so right now it's this season (96:43 - 96:48)
as great league and they are already set (96:47 - 96:51)
for for the next season it will be ultra (96:48 - 96:53)
league um so it does let you use (96:51 - 96:55)
different Pokemon um so you can still (96:53 - 96:57)
battle nearby with your friends and (96:55 - 96:58)
stuff you can still send to your friends (96:57 - 97:01)
invites if you want to battle them but (96:58 - 97:04)
this is like ranked battles so ideally (97:01 - 97:06)
you're gonna be playing somebody with in (97:04 - 97:09)
the same rank as you and you can win (97:06 - 97:12)
different know you can win start us and (97:09 - 97:14)
rare candy and stuff more (97:12 - 97:18)
once you make it - I think so I'm in (97:14 - 97:19)
level two right now I think you just (97:18 - 97:21)
have to play five matches to get to (97:19 - 97:24)
level two you can you can unlock a (97:21 - 97:24)
scraggy (97:24 - 97:28)
which some people were also upset about (97:24 - 97:31)
because that would require you to win (97:28 - 97:34)
hmm even you get an award for actually (97:31 - 97:38)
winning something yeah I can't remember (97:34 - 97:41)
any else wouldn't understand that yeah I (97:38 - 97:43)
think I don't know if it matters how (97:41 - 97:46)
many times you lose though so there's (97:43 - 97:47)
like premium out rewards and there's (97:46 - 97:49)
basic rewards I don't know what the (97:47 - 97:50)
difference between those are I'm I am a (97:49 - 97:52)
level two I've dealt only done five (97:50 - 97:55)
matches I just unlocked the because you (97:52 - 97:57)
had to walk five kilometres to unlock it (97:55 - 97:59)
otherwise you had to pay I think 200 (97:57 - 98:02)
coins and I was like that's fine I'm (97:59 - 98:03)
like I like it but I don't like it (98:02 - 98:07)
enough to pay two bucks but they believe (98:03 - 98:09)
they've lowered it as of this recording (98:07 - 98:13)
- you only have to walk 3k instead of 5k (98:09 - 98:16)
which i think is better (98:13 - 98:18)
I was actually talking to Bobby prior to (98:16 - 98:20)
this I think the only reason it was so (98:18 - 98:22)
high at 5k is because that was a way for (98:20 - 98:25)
them to manually throttle their server (98:22 - 98:29)
mode so they could one slowly let like (98:25 - 98:31)
level 37 players level 30 players level (98:29 - 98:36)
20 players in slowly but also (98:31 - 98:38)
because people can connect with other (98:36 - 98:41)
people consistently if they blocked it (98:38 - 98:44)
behind 5k they could slow that down to (98:41 - 98:47)
make sure that the servers were good and (98:44 - 98:48)
now that I'm sure their servers can (98:47 - 98:50)
handle it they lowered it from five to (98:48 - 98:51)
three (98:50 - 98:53)
I don't know if it'll go any lower but (98:51 - 98:57)
also I think the walking thing is fine I (98:53 - 98:59)
mean the whole literally the whole point (98:57 - 99:02)
of Pokemon go is to walk until I get out (98:59 - 99:07)
in place I think I think III don't know (99:02 - 99:10)
what the average of like walking is like (99:07 - 99:15)
when I did have a nine-to-five job I'd (99:10 - 99:17)
be hitting at least 2k every day just (99:15 - 99:20)
walking from my office to the bathroom (99:17 - 99:23)
or to the break room or to my car to my (99:20 - 99:25)
desk and I had to go up flights of (99:23 - 99:28)
stairs it's a lot harder for me working (99:25 - 99:30)
at home but I don't think 3k is (99:28 - 99:33)
unreasonable to do you're five I mean (99:30 - 99:34)
you could just keep it and pay I guess (99:33 - 99:37)
no I don't think that's unreasonable at (99:34 - 99:40)
all I think five jaywalking game yeah I (99:37 - 99:43)
think 5k was a little much (99:40 - 99:47)
I've can only but three miles that's (99:43 - 99:49)
nothing (99:47 - 99:51)
okay final bit of news here I almost (99:49 - 99:55)
forgot this is off pokemon.com actually (99:51 - 99:56)
here now I'll just pull the press (99:55 - 99:57)
release that's actually a little bit (99:56 - 100:00)
more concise so this is just the press (99:57 - 100:02)
release also on Pokemon comm though the (100:00 - 100:04)
legendary Pokemon Rayquaza and its (100:02 - 100:08)
trainer zinnia is that he said yeah yeah (100:04 - 100:09)
I don't know how to say her name is (100:08 - 100:12)
zinnia are now available to battle and (100:09 - 100:15)
has been added to a sync pair of Pokemon (100:12 - 100:17)
masters the real-time battling and (100:15 - 100:19)
strategy game can be downloaded the (100:17 - 100:21)
in-game event is called the dragon that (100:19 - 100:24)
rules the sky it's available now until (100:21 - 100:29)

will be able to earn up to 4200 gems for (100:31 - 100:37)
free which is according to this press (100:34 - 100:41)
release 14 tries to add more sync pairs (100:37 - 100:43)
to your team (100:41 - 100:47)
DNA has also announced and the following (100:43 - 100:50)
content update Lethe and Evie come to (100:47 - 100:53)
passio Cucuy I'm like in rock are now (100:50 - 100:57)
available and the game has celebrated 20 (100:53 - 101:00)
million downloads worldwide and if you (100:57 - 101:03)
log in now until March 15th you will get (101:00 - 101:07)
fifteen hundred three gems which is I (101:03 - 101:11)
think five poles the zinnia event is (101:07 - 101:14)
very similar to the Giovanni and Mewtwo (101:11 - 101:19)
event and the your character and so (101:14 - 101:24)
Gallio event which is you don't pull her (101:19 - 101:27)
you do the event and then when you (101:24 - 101:29)
complete the event and you get her and (101:27 - 101:32)
rake rick ways ax and then you continue (101:29 - 101:36)
to do the event to power them up yep (101:32 - 101:40)
it's a lot it's yeah it's a weird pair (101:36 - 101:40)
too (101:40 - 101:43)
yeah I wasn't completely satisfied with (101:40 - 101:46)
Lance I put a lot into Lance and I just (101:43 - 101:48)
don't see myself you I'm sure there's a (101:46 - 101:52)
situation where Lance is good I (101:48 - 101:56)
definitely find multiple situations that (101:52 - 101:59)
you Cynthia yes it is great which I'm (101:56 - 102:02)
happy with but (101:59 - 102:05)
I guess I haven't done this event yet (102:02 - 102:07)
I'll probably do it this week I guess (102:05 - 102:10)
like the sink pair like does a lot of (102:07 - 102:14)
damage to themselves well so the biggest (102:10 - 102:17)
problem is that all of its moves have (102:14 - 102:19)
pretty (102:17 - 102:21)
major drawbacks the other one that (102:19 - 102:25)
doesn't which is aerial ace but the (102:21 - 102:29)
other two are outraged and break oh (102:25 - 102:32)
meteor outrage will confuse you in Draco (102:29 - 102:38)
meteor will lower your stats which they (102:32 - 102:40)
have stellar imagination which will (102:38 - 102:43)
remove that but the problem is there's (102:40 - 102:47)
no way to increase zinnias speed so a (102:43 - 102:49)
lot of times where you would use them in (102:47 - 102:53)
coop you're just waiting because you (102:49 - 102:54)
have to use the bed move first (102:53 - 102:59)
then wait use the cellar imagination to (102:54 - 103:02)
help compensate for it and then try (102:59 - 103:07)
again so it what if you've really V yeah (103:02 - 103:10)
I mean and then the Eevee it doesn t v-- (103:07 - 103:13)
like here over the sink move which takes (103:10 - 103:16)
nine turns to get to huh I haven't I (103:13 - 103:18)
hadn't pulled the Eevee yet I'm saving (103:16 - 103:22)
my gems for something else (103:18 - 103:24)
so I don't know that something else is (103:22 - 103:27)
I'd yeah I'm just not a huge like I know (103:24 - 103:29)
what people love leaf (103:27 - 103:32)
I'm just doesn't do it for me so and the (103:29 - 103:34)
thing about stellar imagination is that (103:32 - 103:37)
remove confusion flinching and trapped (103:34 - 103:39)
conditions and then it's sharper sharply (103:37 - 103:41)
raises attack and special attack but (103:39 - 103:43)
it's sharply lowers defense and special (103:41 - 103:47)
defense so it's really it's really hard (103:43 - 103:53)
to use well it when it can hit it it (103:47 - 103:55)
does do a lot of damage is just there (103:53 - 103:59)
are many other ones out there that are (103:55 - 104:02)
better at doing all of those things than (103:59 - 104:06)
this one so right now I'm just I'm just (104:02 - 104:08)
using all the stuff I get out of the (104:06 - 104:10)
event to raise it to wherever I want it (104:08 - 104:12)
and then it will probably sit in the (104:10 - 104:14)
dust unless there's some major changes (104:12 - 104:16)
like a better support Pokemon that will (104:14 - 104:18)
help it speed faster like it it's just (104:16 - 104:21)
not feeling a great roll right now that (104:18 - 104:24)
Flannery is real good now apparently hey (104:21 - 104:27)
that's what I read I read the movie (104:24 - 104:31)
we're very happy with the sync rate for (104:27 - 104:33)
Flannery but I have I am NOT I mean so i (104:31 - 104:35)
don't even think i have enough Flannery (104:33 - 104:39)
to power her the problem is is right (104:35 - 104:42)
it's good right now but when everybody (104:39 - 104:45)
gets a sync grid Flannery will probably (104:42 - 104:48)
fall back to the tier 3 that Flannery (104:45 - 104:50)
always has been in like it's hard to say (104:48 - 104:53)
hey do all of your sync Ritz now when we (104:50 - 104:55)
know everything else is getting a sink (104:53 - 104:55)
rate (104:55 - 104:59)
and we don't know if that sync renewing (104:55 - 105:02)
that you're investing right now once (104:59 - 105:04)
everything has it will Flannery still be (105:02 - 105:06)
oh I see what you're saying or will it (105:04 - 105:08)
just be back to the middle of the pack (105:06 - 105:10)
because now everybody can be powered up (105:08 - 105:12)
in much better ways so I feel like (105:10 - 105:15)
Flannery wasn't great and I'm getting a (105:12 - 105:17)
boost right now but (105:15 - 105:20)
I could also use those same things for (105:17 - 105:23)
things that are already great now to (105:20 - 105:26)
make them greater like it I I'm having a (105:23 - 105:28)
hard time investing in Flannery knowing (105:26 - 105:30)
that it was terrible before it's good (105:28 - 105:33)
now but how long is that gonna last hey (105:30 - 105:37)
I don't care how good or bad that Liza (105:33 - 105:39)
is she's on my team (105:37 - 105:44)
I like well please I like the zinger (105:39 - 105:47)
it's striking there that's my team on (105:44 - 105:53)
masters input for the week III actually (105:47 - 105:57)
don't know but I would assume that they (105:53 - 105:59)
will also probably have a Pokemon Day (105:57 - 106:03)
event probably my guess probably so (105:59 - 106:05)
again if you're interested in masters (106:03 - 106:08)
you get the you get the 300 gems every (106:05 - 106:12)
day right now until what did I say the (106:08 - 106:15)
15 16th so you might as well log in and (106:12 - 106:19)
get your gems and then you get the 1,500 (106:15 - 106:21)
gems because of their 20 million (106:19 - 106:24)
download celebration and I'm guessing I (106:21 - 106:26)
am I am definitely guessing that there (106:24 - 106:30)
will be I did that 14 day period (106:26 - 106:32)
why does this press release not say it (106:30 - 106:34)
I'm guessing there will be a Pokemon Day (106:32 - 106:37)
event yeah or this I mean just so you (106:34 - 106:38)
know (106:37 - 106:41)
Zeb strike it is second-tier hey not bad (106:38 - 106:44)
out there so it's it's the second tier (106:41 - 106:46)
to what res reddit evaluating this err (106:44 - 106:50)
no it's just sort of I usually go to the (106:46 - 106:51)
game press site (106:50 - 106:54)
Oh game analytics so like Olivia like in (106:51 - 106:57)
Rutgers Tier one and so unless a Zeb (106:54 - 107:00)
strike is - you're - hey that bad is (106:57 - 107:02)
it's a physical attacker I mean it's a (107:00 - 107:04)
SOT it's definitely a solid choice it's (107:02 - 107:08)
better than Salt Rock hey no Martin no (107:04 - 107:10)
Solrock I'm not interested in it well (107:08 - 107:12)
it's all rocks already in the game hey (107:10 - 107:13)
they can they can they can add another (107:12 - 107:14)
one (107:13 - 107:17)
alright let's question of the week here (107:14 - 107:21)
Greg alright ready I followed wills (107:17 - 107:24)
request okay boy (107:21 - 107:30)
all right which Care Bear is beware and (107:24 - 107:35)
which Pokemon are the cousins these (107:30 - 107:39)
thoughts will plague me till I die (107:35 - 107:45)
what's the question of the week I cry (107:39 - 107:49)
excellent well done congratulations (107:45 - 107:53)
for you yes for you we have a lot of (107:49 - 107:55)
good questions this week yeah we do (107:53 - 107:56)
there are a lot of good I might (107:55 - 107:58)
screenshot this and save save some of (107:56 - 108:00)
these questions for the future I think (107:58 - 108:04)
the one will go with though is Robert's (108:00 - 108:07)
question from our slack community (108:04 - 108:10)
what could Game Freak do to make you all (108:07 - 108:13)
want to make you all stop playing a main (108:10 - 108:18)
series game card $16 something called (108:13 - 108:20)
Pokemon sword and shield and make it (108:18 - 108:25)
real boring so I was thinking about this (108:20 - 108:28)
and if the games just turned into (108:25 - 108:30)
something similar to pokémon battle (108:28 - 108:33)
revolution where it's just battling then (108:30 - 108:37)
I would probably be out hmm if they (108:33 - 108:40)
turned into games like call us to kill (108:37 - 108:42)
if dark new cloud would be out I need (108:40 - 108:45)
more puzzles I just want more puzzles (108:42 - 108:49)
please puzzles puzzles like the gym (108:45 - 108:53)
buzzes that and like move the blocks (108:49 - 108:56)
around to get to the legendary Pokemon (108:53 - 108:58)
and that kind of stuff or like figure (108:56 - 109:01)
out which path to go in the underground (108:58 - 109:05)
world mm-hmm so I was I was thinking (109:01 - 109:09)
about this too of I played so much (109:05 - 109:13)
destiny destiny has puzzles yeah sure I (109:09 - 109:18)
played a lot of destiny and when they (109:13 - 109:21)
announced that oh you know all those (109:18 - 109:23)
guns and all those emblems and all the (109:21 - 109:28)
ships and all the shaders some (109:23 - 109:30)
those emblems and shaders cost real (109:28 - 109:33)
money or somewhere exclusive to these (109:30 - 109:35)
events that you went to or you didn't go (109:33 - 109:38)
to and you've decided to buy them on (109:35 - 109:41)
eBay those were not coming forward to a (109:38 - 109:48)
second game I was so mad and bummed at (109:41 - 109:50)
that and they were like well here's what (109:48 - 109:52)
we're gonna do instead of you bringing (109:50 - 109:55)
all 120 shaders that you collected over (109:52 - 109:58)
the three years in Destiny one we're (109:55 - 110:01)
gonna give you this one shader to say (109:58 - 110:03)
that like shader by the way a shader is (110:01 - 110:07)
just like it changed your armor color so (110:03 - 110:08)
you could collect different armor but (110:07 - 110:11)
you could then put a shader on it and (110:08 - 110:13)
then it would look relatively pleasant (110:11 - 110:15)
together right yes they were like (110:13 - 110:17)
instead of you collected all this stuff (110:15 - 110:20)
and you did all this things to get all (110:17 - 110:21)
this stuff but we're gonna give you back (110:20 - 110:24)
this one emblem to show that you did all (110:21 - 110:26)
this work (110:24 - 110:28)
and I was like it's not really good (110:26 - 110:30)
enough but that's fire I love I love (110:28 - 110:35)
destiny a lot I'm super I didn't even I (110:30 - 110:38)
was so mad about this of like because (110:35 - 110:40)
they sell they sold destiny as like a (110:38 - 110:43)
ten year game of like everything is (110:40 - 110:45)
gonna come with you on this journey and (110:43 - 110:47)
then at some point obviously they (110:45 - 110:49)
decided to like you know what we're (110:47 - 110:53)
starting over we're gonna give what year (110:49 - 110:54)
will destiny one players some (110:53 - 110:57)
recognition and then we're gonna do it (110:54 - 111:01)
all again in destiny - and while destiny (110:57 - 111:03)
- was like very similar in a lot of (111:01 - 111:06)
aspects they changed enough where it (111:03 - 111:09)
just wasn't fun to me anymore so they (111:06 - 111:12)
like they changed some of the abilities (111:09 - 111:15)
of the classes I played they like (111:12 - 111:18)
changed the Super's and The Ultimates (111:15 - 111:23)
they changed how which guns you held and (111:18 - 111:26)
it just they changed a little bit of (111:23 - 111:29)
everything enough to be like I like this (111:26 - 111:32)
but also I don't and I don't know what (111:29 - 111:35)
that would be specifically in Pokemon (111:32 - 111:37)
because every change they've made so far (111:35 - 111:39)
are changes that I've actually really (111:37 - 111:42)
liked like for example there's not a lot (111:39 - 111:45)
of trainers that you need to battle to (111:42 - 111:47)
get to the end of that game in sword and (111:45 - 111:48)
shield (111:47 - 111:49)
maybe that's why well doesn't like it (111:48 - 111:52)
may it do you because the the routes (111:49 - 111:54)
aren't littered with like 200 trainers (111:52 - 111:56)
with four Magikarp each that you just (111:54 - 111:59)
plow through that artifice to give you (111:56 - 112:02)
the illusion of like slowing you down (111:59 - 112:08)
yes I love those changes but I think for (112:02 - 112:10)
some people they they like the (112:08 - 112:14)
experience share always being on people (112:10 - 112:17)
hate that because it because it takes (112:14 - 112:19)
away the like oh I have to sit in the (112:17 - 112:22)
grass and I have to kill lit bug a (112:19 - 112:24)
million times in order to get ready for (112:22 - 112:27)
the next gym but I love (112:24 - 112:31)
that I don't have to do that so really (112:27 - 112:33)
every every change they've made has been (112:31 - 112:36)
pretty good for me where I could now I (112:33 - 112:38)
can relate to the people that want I (112:36 - 112:41)
mean I think those people are maybe (112:38 - 112:45)
hey whatever if you enjoy killing wild (112:41 - 112:47)
Pokemon and that makes the game more fun (112:45 - 112:51)
to you over and over again I get it but (112:47 - 112:52)
I also don't get it but I can see how (112:51 - 112:54)
those little changes eventually add up (112:52 - 112:56)
to push somebody away from a game if (112:54 - 112:58)
they got rid of cooking like if it was (112:56 - 113:01)
just main series rental codes go and do (112:58 - 113:04)
competitive you would still play that no (113:01 - 113:07)
I wouldn't play that no I mean I would (113:04 - 113:10)
play it but I wouldn't play it (113:07 - 113:12)
every day like I've been playing most (113:10 - 113:14)
Pokemon games nowadays I'm to the point (113:12 - 113:16)
where I don't want to Masuda anymore I'm (113:14 - 113:19)
to the point where breeding is like not (113:16 - 113:23)
great but I can ignore that part I just (113:19 - 113:26)
it's just it's the same and that's I'm (113:23 - 113:29)
sure people love that but like mana it's (113:26 - 113:31)
literally the same since Gen 4 and it's (113:29 - 113:34)
it's very tiresome (113:31 - 113:36)
I mean it's not the same but what do you (113:34 - 113:38)
mean it's not the same I mean you put (113:36 - 113:41)
two in yeah give whatever stone you give (113:38 - 113:43)
one the Destiny night you spend in a (113:41 - 113:46)
circle Steve do you know how braiding (113:43 - 113:48)
works in real life you put two people (113:46 - 113:51)
together look I read the Pokemon go (113:48 - 113:53)
press release I know you bodyslam you (113:51 - 113:55)
get the lake a tongue I understand I (113:53 - 113:58)
mean it is definitely a thing to do (113:55 - 114:00)
while I'm doing other things right they (113:58 - 114:02)
like you're right they change two egg (114:00 - 114:04)
moves they change egg moves they changed (114:02 - 114:07)
it so that you can put like if you have (114:04 - 114:09)
one that you like and just delete the (114:07 - 114:12)
move you all transfer over and you're (114:09 - 114:14)
good like there are massive changes (114:12 - 114:17)
shining shiny hunting breeding has never (114:14 - 114:18)
changed ever will be it is literally (114:17 - 114:20)
something I do while watching the finale (114:18 - 114:22)
did a good place which is what I did and (114:20 - 114:24)
I cried the entire time that's what I do (114:22 - 114:26)
when I eat my breakfast in the morning (114:24 - 114:28)
and I make little videos for a snapchat (114:26 - 114:34)
followers yep in tempt em oh here we go (114:28 - 114:36)
I'd have to I'd have to I've never (114:34 - 114:38)
actually done this in time time I was (114:36 - 114:40)
watching another streamer explain it but (114:38 - 114:43)
apparently the males stopped becoming (114:40 - 114:46)
like fertile and you have to like you (114:43 - 114:47)
can't use them for breeding after a (114:46 - 114:49)
certain amount of time and you have to (114:47 - 114:51)
like switch which is kind of interesting (114:49 - 114:53)
I don't know if that would make it more (114:51 - 114:55)
fun that actually just seems like more (114:53 - 114:57)
busy work but it is interested in more (114:55 - 115:01)
busy work I I'd have to see it in motion (114:57 - 115:02)
but also the other thing that I thought (115:01 - 115:04)
again I don't think this makes it better (115:02 - 115:07)
but instead of like a breeder crossing (115:04 - 115:09)
their arms to say an egg grows ready you (115:07 - 115:11)
can see like two eggs queue up on the (115:09 - 115:12)
shelf and you can just grab them from (115:11 - 115:15)
there which is kind of dobble I mean (115:12 - 115:16)
they're pushing will away but wills (115:15 - 115:17)
never really elaborated what (115:16 - 115:22)
specifically is the reason boring I'm (115:17 - 115:24)
kind of excited to go into Rose tower so (115:22 - 115:26)
we'll see but what sweepin up for but (115:24 - 115:29)
like what's what's boring or the fight (115:26 - 115:31)
boring i if they had literally (115:29 - 115:34)
elaborated if they just literally just (115:31 - 115:40)
made it that even for like like the FIR (115:34 - 115:43)
time you go to the wild area and you (115:40 - 115:45)
know the first half of the game you (115:43 - 115:47)
didn't see anything except for a new (115:45 - 115:48)
Pokemon I would have been fine it's the (115:47 - 115:50)
fact that I was just confronted with old (115:48 - 115:52)
Pokemon that I didn't care about because (115:50 - 115:55)
I already have 18 copies of them so (115:52 - 115:57)
early in the game it just it's I was (115:55 - 115:59)
almost like this isn't a new game I'm (115:57 - 116:01)
just playing an old game with a new (115:59 - 116:05)
overlay so that's that's what kind of (116:01 - 116:07)
took it away from me (116:05 - 116:10)
thanks why I did that though no no no no (116:07 - 116:13)
exit why started out you got all it was (116:10 - 116:16)
it was very very deep Pokemon until you (116:13 - 116:18)
got much further into the game and then (116:16 - 116:21)
also it was like with the Horde (116:18 - 116:22)
mechanics and everything that made it (116:21 - 116:25)
that much more exciting so I I (116:22 - 116:27)
definitely don't think there's a (116:25 - 116:28)
comparison there hmm (116:27 - 116:30)
that first forest had all those three (116:28 - 116:33)
garbage monkeys in it that is true I (116:30 - 116:36)
never knew monkeys there were new (116:33 - 116:38)
monkeys in Gen 5 there are not new (116:36 - 116:40)
monkeys and Gen 6 (116:38 - 116:42)
they're not garbage monkeys they're (116:40 - 116:45)
wonderful I mean also the first forest (116:42 - 116:47)
didn't (116:45 - 116:47)
I had Caterpie in it yeah it did (116:48 - 116:56)
what was it the very first thing you run (116:53 - 116:58)
into and that first thing that you have (116:56 - 117:01)
to catch this Vigi I like Dixon why yeah (116:58 - 117:02)
me too (117:01 - 117:05)
except for aerial battles please take (117:02 - 117:07)
those away and give us more reverse (117:05 - 117:09)
battles well what a fiddly expansion (117:07 - 117:11)
they have a place where you can plant (117:09 - 117:15)
trees I mean I I did you know I am still (117:11 - 117:17)
playing sword and shield I know just no (117:15 - 117:21)
not as rapidly as I would have liked (117:17 - 117:24)
okay I can tell you a couple things that (117:21 - 117:25)
I don't like about sword and shield but (117:24 - 117:27)
not enough to push me away I think pokey (117:25 - 117:31)
jobs are absolute garbage no I certainly (117:27 - 117:33)
don't waste my time with that I think (117:31 - 117:34)
they're fine I think the eve never find (117:33 - 117:37)
out start I think the only training part (117:34 - 117:38)
of it is great that's not what I'm (117:37 - 117:39)
complaining about I think putting like (117:38 - 117:42)
hey I'm not gonna be playing the game on (117:39 - 117:43)
Sunday because I'm recording a podcast (117:42 - 117:46)
or hey I'm not going to be able to play (117:43 - 117:47)
the game on Thursday because I'm going (117:46 - 117:48)
out to dinner (117:47 - 117:50)
so like pre-planning and putting Pokemon (117:48 - 117:52)
into that to like get them Eevee bribed (117:50 - 117:53)
and came come back the next day I think (117:52 - 117:55)
is great I think that's awesome (117:53 - 117:59)
but like just putting 30 ghost-type (117:55 - 118:01)
pokémon on a mission for them to come (117:59 - 118:04)
back with one nugget is like not worth (118:01 - 118:06)
the trouble of those 30 ghost-type (118:04 - 118:09)
pokémon being puked into your first box (118:06 - 118:12)
or if your first box is like partially (118:09 - 118:13)
full puked into your first and second (118:12 - 118:15)
box or if your second box is partially (118:13 - 118:17)
full puked into your first second and (118:15 - 118:22)
third box it's just not worth like (118:17 - 118:25)
finding those Pokemon and then sending (118:22 - 118:28)
them out for just what comes back is a (118:25 - 118:30)
lousy reward (118:28 - 118:34)
I think pala go was just this well way (118:30 - 118:37)
better like side thing that you could do (118:34 - 118:40)
so that's like one complaint I have is (118:37 - 118:44)
pokey jobs is not a good (118:40 - 118:47)
not a good Pella go substitute and I (118:44 - 118:52)
think that I think that like the game (118:47 - 118:55)
does need a Pella go substitute and what (118:52 - 118:59)
was it an x and y and x and y they like (118:55 - 119:00)
kind of appeared on the bottom screen (118:59 - 119:02)
and kind of danced around and stuff i (119:00 - 119:05)
was like one of the minigames yeah I (119:02 - 119:08)
think the shaking is shaking the trees (119:05 - 119:11)
for berries is awful and again I think (119:08 - 119:13)
Pella Go is better I think Sun and I (119:11 - 119:15)
think x and y was better for getting (119:13 - 119:20)
berries but just like it's just a thing (119:15 - 119:22)
I do you is like alright we're gonna go (119:20 - 119:24)
to every tree we're gonna shake it and (119:22 - 119:26)
sometimes ask wove it comes out and (119:24 - 119:27)
sometimes not but like that (119:26 - 119:29)
act of going to each tree shaking like (119:27 - 119:33)
that little minigame is not fun I mean (119:29 - 119:35)
you get berries at the end of raids but (119:33 - 119:38)
I I don't feeI I think those two things (119:35 - 119:41)
are huge let downs for me but again not (119:38 - 119:42)
enough to push me away from the game (119:41 - 119:44)
because the max raids make up for it (119:42 - 119:47)
which I guess going into future games (119:44 - 119:51)
like I like the max raids so much and I (119:47 - 119:54)
get the best the gimmick of this game (119:51 - 119:57)
but like the co-op feature of doing max (119:54 - 120:00)
raids with three other people and having (119:57 - 120:02)
the chance of hidden ability and getting (120:00 - 120:04)
really good rewards if they take that (120:02 - 120:07)
away from a Pokemon in a future Pokemon (120:04 - 120:09)
game which they probably will boy they (120:07 - 120:10)
have to they better have a good (120:09 - 120:14)
substitute they took away pal ago and (120:10 - 120:16)
they like gave us pokey jobs and that's (120:14 - 120:17)
not good enough (120:16 - 120:20)
no but they didn't take away anything to (120:17 - 120:23)
give us max raids so I can see a future (120:20 - 120:26)
Pokemon game if they if they don't have (120:23 - 120:28)
a good substitute for max raids yeah (120:26 - 120:30)
they took away man teen surf thank you (120:28 - 120:35)
well I would say that the Rotom bike (120:30 - 120:38)
thing is a good substitute I don't know (120:35 - 120:40)
if it's a better substitute but I have (120:38 - 120:42)
and Rotom rally yet now I I do like (120:40 - 120:44)
Rotom rally it's okay (120:42 - 120:47)
I think it's as okay as man teen sir I (120:44 - 120:48)
think man teen serve gave you better (120:47 - 120:51)
rewards oh I agree with that I think it (120:48 - 120:54)
did too but I think Rotom rally is a (120:51 - 120:56)
little bit quicker and a little bit more (120:54 - 120:57)
fun (120:56 - 121:00)
than mantastic also like the changes to (120:57 - 121:02)
the power items and this item may be (121:00 - 121:06)
better so like doing the jobs just isn't (121:02 - 121:11)
as useful like if you can get the power (121:06 - 121:15)
items it's I mean is so much faster than (121:11 - 121:19)
saying go away for 24 hours yeah I mean (121:15 - 121:21)
I timed it it took max out 1 Evie with a (121:19 - 121:23)
power item and poked your wrist and I (121:21 - 121:26)
knocked out what Palpa tote 4 HP I think (121:23 - 121:29)
it took 15 minutes (121:26 - 121:31)
yeah I mean nother thing add +8 instead (121:29 - 121:35)
of plus 4 yeah it's huge but again I (121:31 - 121:38)
mean if you can send if for some reason (121:35 - 121:39)
your life is organized and you're like (121:38 - 121:42)
I'm sending these 30 Pokemon out for HP (121:39 - 121:44)
training for 24 hours because I'm not (121:42 - 121:46)
playing a game that's awesome that's (121:44 - 121:48)
definitely a time save but I have done (121:46 - 121:50)
they're happy but you have to know which (121:48 - 121:52)
Pokemon you're sending out for which (121:50 - 121:53)
Eevee training and what day you're not (121:52 - 121:56)
going to be playing but it does work and (121:53 - 121:59)
you need them all to have the item (121:56 - 122:02)
really or poker s and a thing that (121:59 - 122:04)
doubles it because the 24 hours doesn't (122:02 - 122:08)
get you to max yeah (122:04 - 122:11)
I think pokey wrists and 24 hours gets (122:08 - 122:13)
you to max though right I think he gets (122:11 - 122:18)
to 196 and not mad (122:13 - 122:18)
I'd have to look it up again but I think (122:18 - 122:23)
it since it only doubles it and I think (122:20 - 122:25)
it's (122:23 - 122:26)
only doesn't max if like I think it only (122:25 - 122:29)
did like alone it does 96 and 24 hours (122:26 - 122:31)
and I think it the buggers doubles it (122:29 - 122:33)
I'd have to look again it is not it's (122:31 - 122:37)
not ideal will poke him out of the week (122:33 - 122:40)
oh boy I forgot to bring up last week's (122:37 - 122:42)
Pokemon of the week who was it Greg (122:40 - 122:44)
[Music] (122:42 - 122:46)
[Applause] (122:44 - 122:51)
big Lee but it was a Glee buff um yeah (122:46 - 122:56)
it was it was it was like the song it (122:51 - 123:00)
was a Nick Burgess song yeah and posted (122:56 - 123:02)
it in I posted in the slack the Pokemon (123:00 - 123:05)
of the week slack but the fact that I (123:02 - 123:07)
kept talking about babies meant it was a (123:05 - 123:10)
baby Pokemon there's only so many baby (123:07 - 123:12)
Pokemon out there (123:10 - 123:15)
it evolves when you get high friendship (123:12 - 123:17)
it has competitive cute charm and friend (123:15 - 123:19)
guard as abilities if you didn't pick (123:17 - 123:22)
that up from the song and also the very (123:19 - 123:25)
from my point of view clear some babies (123:22 - 123:28)
want to fill with air and sing out very (123:25 - 123:30)
bad since inglese off is a balloon (123:28 - 123:35)
didn't say like Smoochum is not well (123:30 - 123:38)
that would that would help also the (123:35 - 123:42)
level one moves for a niggly buff our (123:38 - 123:44)
defense curl pound sweet kiss and (123:42 - 123:46)
copycat (123:44 - 123:46)
the shuffle icon is amazing why it's so (123:46 - 123:55)
cute yeah happy to face and his big eye (123:52 - 123:57)
pretty good there's not a lot of good (123:55 - 123:59)
trivia about a Glee buff the one that (123:57 - 124:01)
stands out here is a Glee buff and it's (123:59 - 124:02)
of all forms to share the same category (124:01 - 124:06)
with qwilfish and drifloon they're all (124:02 - 124:08)
known as the balloon Pokemon balloon (124:06 - 124:11)
Pokemon it is the UN 20 year of the (124:08 - 124:12)
drifloon no it's the year the qwilfish (124:11 - 124:15)

Lou didn't sign up in time it was like (124:15 - 124:21)
she was like the PAX panel they had to (124:19 - 124:24)
sign up before December 31st and they (124:21 - 124:25)
missed it and then they didn't get the (124:24 - 124:28)
panel instead qwilfish got the dates (124:25 - 124:29)
wrong and it's air fare and did not (124:28 - 124:34)

sprite animation in black and white and (124:34 - 124:38)
black and white to freak LaBeouf is just (124:36 - 124:41)
amazingly fantastic it's like floating (124:38 - 124:45)
around yeah it's cute (124:41 - 124:45)
all right what's our new plug why the (124:45 - 124:48)
leak oh I don't know if you guys can (124:46 - 124:52)
handle this I can't but I'm gonna try (124:48 - 124:55)
here we go (124:52 - 124:58)
the podcast dewy dudes is dedicated to (124:55 - 124:59)
promoting and reviewing skincare (124:58 - 125:02)
products and techniques for men an area (124:59 - 125:05)
high neglect for many my daily facial (125:02 - 125:07)
skin care routine includes beard and (125:05 - 125:10)
face wash beard softener not hair (125:07 - 125:13)
conditioner facial moisturizer always in (125:10 - 125:16)
a pump bottle and neck never regular (125:13 - 125:20)
skin moisturizer eye cream dab or (125:16 - 125:23)
roll-on never smear and beard oil or (125:20 - 125:25)
cream it is essential to apply (125:23 - 125:27)
moisturizers as soon as possible after (125:25 - 125:30)
washing your face you want to create a (125:27 - 125:32)
protective bubble especially around your (125:30 - 125:34)
face to lock in the moisture and keep (125:32 - 125:36)
your skin looking young and fresh you (125:34 - 125:38)
must use a dedicated facial moisturizer (125:36 - 125:42)
so that it will absorb more readily the (125:38 - 125:43)
question of whether to use a facial (125:42 - 125:46)
moisturizer with an SPF continues to be (125:43 - 125:49)
highly debated on one hand the (125:46 - 125:51)
protection can have the damage of (125:49 - 125:53)
exposure to the fiery Sun and even make (125:51 - 125:55)
it impossible for you to get a burn (125:53 - 125:58)
preventing this damage can virtually (125:55 - 126:00)
double moisturizing effectiveness as the (125:58 - 126:03)
underlying soft head remains undamaged (126:00 - 126:06)
on the other hand SPF and facial (126:03 - 126:08)
moisturizer tends to give an unnatural (126:06 - 126:10)
shininess to the skin I am NOT saying (126:08 - 126:13)
you will turn purple with red eyes but (126:10 - 126:14)
it is still not a good look (126:13 - 126:17)
lately I have also been looking into the (126:14 - 126:19)
potential for advanced anti wrinkling (126:17 - 126:22)
techniques even the most dedicated (126:19 - 126:24)
skincare enthusiasts will develop a line (126:22 - 126:27)
or two over the course of time while (126:24 - 126:29)
Botox has been the go-to for many years (126:27 - 126:33)
the venom of the spider hetero hetero (126:29 - 126:36)
poda David Bowie has been shown to have (126:33 - 126:38)
a similar effect without requiring (126:36 - 126:42)
injections we are still unsure of how (126:38 - 126:45)
long the effect lasts though my last bit (126:42 - 126:47)
of advice is to start a skincare routine (126:45 - 126:50)
as early in life as possible you cannot (126:47 - 126:53)
preserve what has already been lost at (126:50 - 126:54)
the very least you should start before (126:53 - 126:58)
you are 22 after that you may require a (126:54 - 127:00)
more evolved routine (126:58 - 127:01)
all right there you go that's your (127:00 - 127:11)
Pokemon of the week oh boy if you want (127:01 - 127:14)
to join us over on our subreddit our (127:11 - 127:17)
slash super-effective or almost up to (127:14 - 127:22)
1200 people and I will be making a new (127:17 - 127:26)
graphic this week for all the codes that (127:22 - 127:28)
are available for the month of February (127:26 - 127:29)
that you can download and sort and (127:28 - 127:29)
shield (127:29 - 127:31)
I know there are some new ones that just (127:29 - 127:33)
came out over the last couple days and (127:31 - 127:34)
there are some that people probably (127:33 - 127:36)
forgot about that came out earlier in (127:34 - 127:40)
January that are still available so keep (127:36 - 127:42)
your eyes peeled for that on social (127:40 - 127:47)
media twitch offered me a pass to PAX (127:42 - 127:52)
East so I will be at PAX East no panel (127:47 - 127:54)
this year as well and Greg will not be (127:52 - 127:56)
there and I can't do a panel by myself (127:54 - 127:58)
what do you mean I did a panel well with (127:56 - 128:00)
Brittany yeah you see you had another (127:58 - 128:02)
person I'm sure if you asked Brittany to (128:00 - 128:04)
come up for PAX East she would come I'm (128:02 - 128:07)
sure but the PAX is like really weird (128:04 - 128:08)
this year because it's at the end of (128:07 - 128:11)
February and it's usually at like yup (128:08 - 128:15)
mid to end of March and so I normally (128:11 - 128:18)
apply for panels at the beginning of (128:15 - 128:21)
January because they usually ask for (128:18 - 128:23)
people to submit by January 31st and (128:21 - 128:26)
then they usually pick like two weeks (128:23 - 128:29)
beforehand but since they moved it up (128:26 - 128:30)
the panel's got moved up and I got (128:29 - 128:32)
closed out of it so if that's fine no (128:30 - 128:34)
big deal I still got a pass I will still (128:32 - 128:38)
be there I will be there specifically on (128:34 - 128:40)
Friday and Saturday I will actually be (128:38 - 128:43)

twitch stream at twitch.tv slash pkmn (128:56 - 129:00)

I'm sure all the news will be announced (129:00 - 129:07)
the night of the 26 since Japan is in (129:03 - 129:09)
the future but I'm sure they'll save (129:07 - 129:11)

the Miche movie comes out on this one (129:11 - 129:16)
