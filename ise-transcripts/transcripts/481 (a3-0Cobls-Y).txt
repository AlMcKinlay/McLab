the size or issue (3:27 - 3:33)

controversy i've seen (3:34 - 3:38)

msn.com alolan ninetales new pokemon (4:04 - 4:13)
unite hollow wear skin costs 40 dollars (4:08 - 4:16)
the pokemon unite launched a new sacred (4:13 - 4:18)
style halloween for our lola ninetales (4:16 - 4:20)
yesterday it is the most expensive item (4:18 - 4:22)
they've released so far in the zirco (4:20 - 4:24)
trading shop it lists the new cosmetic (4:22 - 4:25)
item as (4:24 - 4:29)
2499 eos gems which translates roughly (4:25 - 4:30)
to 40 (4:29 - 4:32)
the official (4:30 - 4:34)
pokemon unite twitter account posted in (4:32 - 4:36)
celebration of the skins launch (4:34 - 4:38)
yesterday which promoted fans to push (4:36 - 4:39)
back with the criticism of the halloween (4:38 - 4:41)
pricing (4:39 - 4:43)
playing with it to a lower cost the (4:41 - 4:45)
united team has not responded (4:43 - 4:48)
uh if then they then msn goes on to (4:45 - 4:50)
explain what hollower is (4:48 - 4:54)
[Laughter] (4:50 - 4:56)
barring bonus gems one may receive as (4:54 - 4:58)
part of the pokemon unites first time (4:56 - 5:00)
purchase promotion the most cost (4:58 - 5:02)
effective way of scrounging up enough (5:00 - 5:04)
gems for the nine tails skin is to pay (5:02 - 5:09)
39.99 for a total of 2 740 eos gems (5:04 - 5:14)
even if you only wish to spend 2499. (5:09 - 5:14)
and uh yeah i mean that's (5:14 - 5:20)
the article explains the unite for the (5:17 - 5:23)
msn reader who might not know what unite (5:20 - 5:25)
is but we don't have to read that stuff (5:23 - 5:27)
uh so yeah uh (5:25 - 5:30)
whoo here it's a skin (5:27 - 5:32)
it's so ridiculous how much they priced (5:30 - 5:35)
this for it is (5:32 - 5:35)
unbelievable (5:36 - 5:39)
i was like so excited that nine tails (5:37 - 5:43)
was finally getting a uh outfit (5:39 - 5:44)
nighttails is your second most played (5:43 - 5:47)
right yeah second second i was played (5:44 - 5:50)
and it is (5:47 - 5:50)
i'm done i'm done i'm like no you're not (5:52 - 5:56)
no (5:55 - 5:58)
it's not no wait for that 80 dollar mamo (5:56 - 6:00)
swine skin to come out (5:58 - 6:03)
no because mammoth wine isn't even good (6:00 - 6:04)
yeah (6:03 - 6:07)
yet yeah (6:04 - 6:09)
and a lot of people like oh look it (6:07 - 6:10)
finally got we're so excited that we (6:09 - 6:12)
also have the price tag and we're like (6:10 - 6:13)
for what (6:12 - 6:16)
i mean it does come with vulpix too (6:13 - 6:17)
are there any others (6:16 - 6:20)
what that are that expensive no (6:17 - 6:22)
the most expensive thing up to this (6:20 - 6:26)
point was the cramer ant outfit (6:22 - 6:27)
uh which was (6:26 - 6:30)
why do the skins have different costs (6:27 - 6:32)
like everything (6:30 - 6:34)
everything has really weird costs like (6:32 - 6:36)
there's something that's like a hundred (6:34 - 6:37)
and one (6:36 - 6:41)
uh yeah i don't like it but (6:37 - 6:42)
tickets and it's like why is it just not (6:41 - 6:44)
a hundred tickets (6:42 - 6:46)
the cramer ant skin (6:44 - 6:47)
was (6:46 - 6:49)
um (6:47 - 6:50)
it was (6:49 - 6:53)
1760 (6:50 - 6:53)
eos gems (6:53 - 6:57)
which if you're just looking at the (6:54 - 6:58)
uh (6:57 - 7:02)
first time buying eos gems that would be (6:58 - 7:04)
twenty dollars but that is it's giving (7:02 - 7:06)
you one thousand two hundred twenty plus (7:04 - 7:09)
one thousand two hundred twenty (7:06 - 7:11)
so it's i think that crime rate skins (7:09 - 7:14)
closer to twenty five dollars (7:11 - 7:18)
the credit cr sorry the trainer outfit (7:14 - 7:19)
but based off kramer (7:18 - 7:20)
yeah and you can't change your hair (7:19 - 7:21)
color (7:20 - 7:22)
nope (7:21 - 7:25)
just like in the gengar astronaut con (7:22 - 7:26)
thing you can't change your hair color (7:25 - 7:28)
there either it's stuck purple the (7:26 - 7:29)
gengar (7:28 - 7:30)
space outfit (7:29 - 7:34)
is cute and part of the battle pass and (7:30 - 7:36)
the battle pass wasn't even 40 (7:34 - 7:40)
this is somewhat cute it's the only (7:36 - 7:44)
option for nine tails and it's 40 bucks (7:40 - 7:46)
for what it doesn't even fly it doesn't (7:44 - 7:48)
even give you a boost it doesn't even (7:46 - 7:50)
like change the ice into something it (7:48 - 7:52)
doesn't make butterflies come out (7:50 - 7:55)
nothing i believe it does have like (7:52 - 7:57)
animation (7:55 - 7:59)
forty dollars (7:57 - 8:00)
okay so there are different (7:59 - 8:03)
i'm not getting trainer outfits with it (8:00 - 8:06)
no those are separate oh my word i don't (8:03 - 8:08)
know how much those are (8:06 - 8:09)
okay (8:08 - 8:11)
there are different types of i'm i'm not (8:09 - 8:13)
defending it i'm just explaining the (8:11 - 8:14)
different types of skins that exist (8:13 - 8:16)
because they do they are different types (8:14 - 8:18)
of skin so um (8:16 - 8:20)
the cinder ace (8:18 - 8:21)
the (8:20 - 8:22)
talon flame (8:21 - 8:24)
pilot (8:22 - 8:27)
the talonflame pilot and then the gengar (8:24 - 8:30)
are all this the same as this nine tails (8:27 - 8:31)
which means that when you select the (8:30 - 8:34)
skin in the menu there's like a (8:31 - 8:36)
animation that happens there's like a (8:34 - 8:37)
little trailer if you pick the (8:36 - 8:38)
cinderease he like (8:37 - 8:41)
like looks through his eyeglass and he (8:38 - 8:42)
swings on the boat and then he like (8:41 - 8:44)
kicks a ball (8:42 - 8:46)
um (8:44 - 8:48)
and for those four skins the nine tails (8:46 - 8:50)
the cinderease the gengar and the (8:48 - 8:52)
talonflame all (8:50 - 8:57)
evolutions have uh outfits versus the (8:52 - 8:59)
garchomp outfit which he's like the (8:57 - 9:01)
detective outfit the gibbel and the gab (8:59 - 9:02)
i don't have anything it's just the (9:01 - 9:05)
guard chop dang same with the blastoise (9:02 - 9:07)
blastoise has this bad vest on squirtle (9:05 - 9:09)
war twirl doesn't have anything so these (9:07 - 9:10)
for these four (9:09 - 9:12)
um (9:10 - 9:14)
i wish i wish they just named them like (9:12 - 9:16)
like apex it's like (9:14 - 9:17)
um (9:16 - 9:18)
legendary (9:17 - 9:20)
rare (9:18 - 9:22)
common uncommon they don't really name (9:20 - 9:25)
them anything if you if you can buy them (9:22 - 9:28)
they are not rare or uncommon correct (9:25 - 9:31)
if you can purchase them (9:28 - 9:34)
by that matter but and they're digital (9:31 - 9:36)
they don't have a rarity (9:34 - 9:39)
they are more fully fleshed out they are (9:36 - 9:41)
animated they cover the entire line (9:39 - 9:43)
except the whole point of is to not stay (9:41 - 9:46)
as vulpix at three minutes into the hand (9:43 - 9:48)
saying that was rare it was legendary is (9:46 - 9:49)
there any (9:48 - 9:53)
nothing are there any like loot boxes (9:49 - 9:55)
for that include skins and stuff that (9:53 - 9:57)
this might yeah fall out of i mean it (9:55 - 10:00)
could go into one of the battle passes (9:57 - 10:02)
later it could go into a loop no i'm (10:00 - 10:04)
just saying right now are there is there (10:02 - 10:06)
any loot mechanism that this could so (10:04 - 10:10)
yeah that's artificial rarity (10:06 - 10:12)
i mean i don't think they're saying i'm (10:10 - 10:15)
not they're not saying it's rare (10:12 - 10:17)
they're saying it's legendary (10:15 - 10:21)
no no well legendary doesn't mean rare (10:17 - 10:24)
i'd say if you (10:21 - 10:24)
just (10:24 - 10:27)
okay (10:25 - 10:27)
this is wrong (10:29 - 10:32)
okay but okay we shouldn't get in the (10:31 - 10:35)
semantics of rare or not rare some of us (10:32 - 10:37)
collect the pokemon trading card game (10:35 - 10:38)
where some of the rarest cards are worth (10:37 - 10:41)
like two dollars and some of the not (10:38 - 10:43)
rarest cards are worth like (10:41 - 10:45)
20 just because of that's playability (10:43 - 10:47)
card games yes yeah that's all trading (10:45 - 10:49)
card games (10:47 - 10:52)
i mean trading card games the rarity is (10:49 - 10:54)
based off of how many they technically (10:52 - 10:55)
is a (10:54 - 10:57)
dinner rip-off (10:55 - 11:00)
it's like it's you could you could get (10:57 - 11:02)
two dinners at raising canes for forty (11:00 - 11:05)
dollars and i have (11:02 - 11:07)
if okay so (11:05 - 11:08)
if (11:07 - 11:10)
you've put (11:08 - 11:12)
two months into this game and haven't (11:10 - 11:14)
spent any money and nine tails is your (11:12 - 11:15)
favorite (11:14 - 11:18)
i could see somebody being like (11:15 - 11:19)
well i'm gonna continue playing nine (11:18 - 11:21)
tails for another four months (11:19 - 11:23)
because forty dollars is close to the (11:21 - 11:26)
price of a full game that's a lot yeah (11:23 - 11:28)
yes (11:26 - 11:30)
who has been playing this game for that (11:28 - 11:33)
long without putting any money into it (11:30 - 11:35)
i you know that's a good question i i i (11:33 - 11:38)
i haven't touched unite in like two (11:35 - 11:40)
weeks (11:38 - 11:41)
well no that's not true i installed it (11:40 - 11:44)
on my ipad and said wait it doesn't work (11:41 - 11:46)
with my xbox controller i'm out so (11:44 - 11:47)
here's here's the question i want to (11:46 - 11:49)
pose because i spent i bought the most (11:47 - 11:51)
expensive thing on day one (11:49 - 11:53)
which was the cramer ant (11:51 - 11:55)
outfit (11:53 - 11:57)
yeah and now it's just ripped apart and (11:55 - 11:59)
fall into tatters so cheaply made how do (11:57 - 12:01)
you feel about that purchase would you (11:59 - 12:04)
spend 40 on (12:01 - 12:08)
your favorite pokemon snorlax no (12:04 - 12:09)
well let's just say your favorite (12:08 - 12:11)
pokemon was in the game no i i just (12:09 - 12:13)
happened my favorite pokemon i just had (12:11 - 12:15)
this conversation at my with my (12:13 - 12:16)
hairdresser yesterday (12:15 - 12:19)
that world of warcraft killed my (12:16 - 12:22)
cosmetic purchase (12:19 - 12:23)
desire (12:22 - 12:25)
because when that game went south i (12:23 - 12:27)
realized how much money i put into (12:25 - 12:30)
digital nothing (12:27 - 12:34)
nothing that nobody but me cared about (12:30 - 12:37)
and i when i walk away from a bad game (12:34 - 12:39)
when the bag when the game goes south (12:37 - 12:41)
i've just literally gave them money for (12:39 - 12:42)
nothing (12:41 - 12:44)
like the closing the closest thing for (12:42 - 12:47)
me is in in vanguard there's like (12:44 - 12:49)
there's always like an extra rarity for (12:47 - 12:52)
pretty much every card and a lot of (12:49 - 12:55)
vanguard players will max rarity their (12:52 - 12:57)
deck and they're like literally spending (12:55 - 12:59)
five hundred dollars for a deck that if (12:57 - 13:02)
you do regular rarity costs about (12:59 - 13:04)
eighty-five and (13:02 - 13:06)
you know what (13:04 - 13:08)
for the four to eight hours a week that (13:06 - 13:10)
i get to play vanguard (13:08 - 13:12)
the cards do exactly the same thing yeah (13:10 - 13:15)
yeah they work the same if i happen to (13:12 - 13:18)
pull a secret parallel card um you know (13:15 - 13:20)
what fun i'll put it in my deck it's (13:18 - 13:22)
sparkly it's really hard for me to read (13:20 - 13:24)
with my bifocal contacts but still (13:22 - 13:27)
uh but otherwise (13:24 - 13:28)
no (13:27 - 13:31)
it doesn't do anything except you could (13:28 - 13:33)
have given that money to charity there's (13:31 - 13:35)
lots of things in the world that don't (13:33 - 13:37)
do anything i got a hundred dollar metal (13:35 - 13:38)
pokeball it doesn't do anything yeah you (13:37 - 13:41)
should be giving that money to charity (13:38 - 13:45)
there's hungry people out there (13:41 - 13:45)
even even even if it was my favorite (13:47 - 13:54)
pokemon a 40 dollar price tag (13:50 - 13:59)
would absolutely stop me 40 100 (13:54 - 14:04)
i can't come i cannot come up with 15 (13:59 - 14:07)
for a mountain final fantasy 14 a game i (14:04 - 14:08)
have been playing now there are mounts (14:07 - 14:10)
that are 40 right in final fantasy like (14:08 - 14:12)
the whale is the whale is 40. right and (14:10 - 14:15)
i'm not i i'm not no even that i can't (14:12 - 14:16)
even do the cheap ones (14:15 - 14:19)
because i can't (14:16 - 14:19)
it does i (14:20 - 14:23)
it doesn't matter it does not make me (14:21 - 14:27)
happier it does not make me think (14:23 - 14:29)
i'm enjoying this character more because (14:27 - 14:31)
it's dressed differently and it doesn't (14:29 - 14:32)
it makes me feel even worse because i (14:31 - 14:34)
spent (14:32 - 14:37)
way too much money on it in comparison (14:34 - 14:40)
to everything else in that game (14:37 - 14:42)
and there's no reason for it to be this (14:40 - 14:44)
expensive none par part of the problem (14:42 - 14:46)
too though i think greg (14:44 - 14:48)
which which may be skewing us i mean (14:46 - 14:50)
i've got to take that (14:48 - 14:51)
that (14:50 - 14:54)
perspective somewhat is that (14:51 - 14:57)
in 1984 40 would have bought me three (14:54 - 14:59)
optimus primes like the big good (14:57 - 15:01)
transformers not the little ones in the (14:59 - 15:03)
tiny packaging but the big ones that (15:01 - 15:05)
came in the box yeah that were made out (15:03 - 15:08)
of metal nuke 40 is real money (15:05 - 15:10)
yeah it's (15:08 - 15:11)
if it was 10 (15:10 - 15:13)
i'd be like oh okay maybe yeah i really (15:11 - 15:16)
like nine tails it's only 10 bucks (15:13 - 15:18)
there you go sure that's a price point (15:16 - 15:20)
for (15:18 - 15:23)
content that does nothing 20 is like (15:20 - 15:25)
[Music] (15:23 - 15:27)
40 is a (15:25 - 15:30)
heck no you've got to be kidding me see (15:27 - 15:32)
i i have an alolan (15:30 - 15:35)
vulpix right there (15:32 - 15:36)
i'm familiar with that (15:35 - 15:38)
also (15:36 - 15:43)
as a gift look if somebody gifted me 40 (15:38 - 15:45)
no not all the conversations okay that's (15:43 - 15:48)
on them for making poor life choices so (15:45 - 15:51)
i have been playing apex legends for two (15:48 - 15:52)
years (15:51 - 15:54)
and the thing about apex legends is (15:52 - 15:56)
their best skins (15:54 - 16:00)
are twenty dollars for a character (15:56 - 16:04)
and they don't really do that much (16:00 - 16:04)
compared to anything else right (16:05 - 16:09)
like there are there's your your (16:07 - 16:12)
level four is your best one your 20 skin (16:09 - 16:13)
then you have your level three which is (16:12 - 16:15)
usually like ten dollars then you have (16:13 - 16:17)
your level two and no one's buying level (16:15 - 16:18)
two and level ones because those are (16:17 - 16:20)
just no you just never equip them (16:18 - 16:22)
they're just garbage they're just (16:20 - 16:23)
nothing (16:22 - 16:24)
um (16:23 - 16:25)
and the (16:24 - 16:29)
gun skins like a gun that you (16:25 - 16:32)
might not even pick up in the match (16:29 - 16:33)
because you're it's a battle royale you (16:32 - 16:35)
drop in you pick up what you have you (16:33 - 16:38)
could be dead before then a gun skin (16:35 - 16:39)
for a gun that you can only see the (16:38 - 16:42)
front part of is also 20 in that game (16:39 - 16:44)
and and it has been (16:42 - 16:47)
20 for legendary characters or legendary (16:44 - 16:49)
guns since day (16:47 - 16:51)
one (16:49 - 16:52)
and (16:51 - 16:54)
people have complained (16:52 - 16:57)
every single day on the apex subreddit (16:54 - 16:59)
sometimes you get enough of these people (16:57 - 17:01)
to log in at the same time and it makes (16:59 - 17:03)
it to the top of the page of wow these (17:01 - 17:05)
things are too expensive (17:03 - 17:07)
and it's been over two years and respawn (17:05 - 17:10)
has not changed their pricing in fact (17:07 - 17:12)
they've doubled down on some of that (17:10 - 17:14)
stuff where (17:12 - 17:17)
originally a loot box in apex legends is (17:14 - 17:19)
is a dollar and they do these (17:17 - 17:22)
celebration loot boxes which are seven (17:19 - 17:24)
dollars (17:22 - 17:26)
um and they still give you three polls (17:24 - 17:29)
uh (17:26 - 17:31)
and there are what are called heirlooms (17:29 - 17:32)
in that game and during these (17:31 - 17:35)
celebration events if you collect all (17:32 - 17:37)
the celebration items you can get the (17:35 - 17:39)
heirloom and the heirloom lets you cash (17:37 - 17:40)
in for (17:39 - 17:42)
all an heirloom is is a character (17:40 - 17:44)
holding an item so instead of running (17:42 - 17:46)
with no gun they run with like a a (17:44 - 17:47)
wrench or they run with like a knife to (17:46 - 17:50)
like signify you know they got the (17:47 - 17:51)
heirloom (17:50 - 17:52)
so (17:51 - 17:54)
let's say they released an heirloom for (17:52 - 17:56)
bangalore they did this (17:54 - 17:57)
let's say your favorite character is (17:56 - 17:59)
bangalore the in order to get the (17:57 - 18:00)
bangalore heirloom you either have to (17:59 - 18:02)
get it out of a loot box or if you (18:00 - 18:03)
complete the celebration event you can (18:02 - 18:06)
then cash in to get bangalore's item (18:03 - 18:07)
that was (18:06 - 18:10)
i'm not exaggerating it's about 200 (18:07 - 18:13)
to complete the celebration event (18:10 - 18:14)
because the loot boxes are seven dollars (18:13 - 18:17)
you gotta open the loot boxes make sure (18:14 - 18:18)
you don't get doubles (18:17 - 18:20)
and then (18:18 - 18:22)
you did it you completed the celebration (18:20 - 18:23)
event (18:22 - 18:24)
you spent 200 bucks now you have the (18:23 - 18:26)
bangalore heirloom (18:24 - 18:27)
so (18:26 - 18:29)
to me i'm not (18:27 - 18:32)
defending the 40 in pokemon unite i am (18:29 - 18:34)
saying that (18:32 - 18:36)
i am sure there are other games out (18:34 - 18:37)
there besides apex legends that are (18:36 - 18:39)
worse but apex legends is very bad it's (18:37 - 18:41)
been around for two years they haven't (18:39 - 18:43)
changed their pricing i don't see the (18:41 - 18:45)
complaints of nine tails getting changed (18:43 - 18:47)
i think this is kind of the way it is (18:45 - 18:50)
and it sucks yeah um (18:47 - 18:52)
but (18:50 - 18:54)
i already know people who bought it like (18:52 - 18:56)
i do too the difference is is that (18:54 - 18:59)
united is new and apex is old and the (18:56 - 19:01)
people who have been playing apex are (18:59 - 19:03)
it's just like they're used to it by now (19:01 - 19:05)
but for unite since it's new it's like (19:03 - 19:07)
we are shocked (19:05 - 19:09)
i mean i would tell i would look at the (19:07 - 19:12)
apex thing be like no (19:09 - 19:14)
yeah i mean but i've been playing apex (19:12 - 19:16)
for two years and my favorite character (19:14 - 19:19)
crypto he doesn't have an heirloom yet (19:16 - 19:21)
and they will probably do a celebration (19:19 - 19:24)
event for crypto (19:21 - 19:24)
and crypto so it's like (19:26 - 19:32)
i have i have put in two years of apex (19:29 - 19:34)
legends i have put (19:32 - 19:36)
fifty dollars in (19:34 - 19:38)
uh besides battle oh geez besides battle (19:36 - 19:40)
passes i bought the battle pass every (19:38 - 19:41)
three months so the battle pass every (19:40 - 19:44)
three months is what like 10 bucks (19:41 - 19:46)
um but for like loot boxes slash (19:44 - 19:48)
celebration events um i think i've only (19:46 - 19:50)
put 50 bucks in (19:48 - 19:52)
only uh and you when i put the 50 bucks (19:50 - 19:54)
in i i didn't feel good there was (19:52 - 19:56)
nothing out of the 50 where i was like (19:54 - 19:59)
yup this was worth it (19:56 - 20:02)
all right so to all of our economists (19:59 - 20:04)
that are listening to this program alert (20:02 - 20:06)
alert late stage capitalism we're here (20:04 - 20:08)
you are looking for the signs the signs (20:06 - 20:10)
have appeared people are throwing here (20:08 - 20:12)
for a while money (20:10 - 20:13)
at (20:12 - 20:14)
nothing (20:13 - 20:20)
i met a guy at twitchcon uh this is (20:14 - 20:20)
because i i had a hustle to that twitch (20:20 - 20:25)
party and greg was doing d d stuff (20:22 - 20:26)
but for some reason we were talking (20:25 - 20:29)
about apex legends and uh the guy the (20:26 - 20:31)
guy i was standing next to he said he (20:29 - 20:34)
has purchased every single skin in apex (20:31 - 20:36)
legends up to that point and i want to (20:34 - 20:38)
remind you (20:36 - 20:39)
that (20:38 - 20:41)
skins are 20 (20:39 - 20:43)
for characters and guns and most guns (20:41 - 20:46)
and skins have like five plus different (20:43 - 20:48)
variations (20:46 - 20:50)
where do you get this money so proud i (20:48 - 20:51)
just (20:50 - 20:53)
he was very he was very proud that he (20:51 - 20:55)
owned everything but i haven't had that (20:53 - 20:57)
mentality over medical bills and some (20:55 - 21:01)
dudes spending five thousand dollars on (20:57 - 21:02)
you you can't say you had that mentality (21:01 - 21:04)
with destiny because with destiny it (21:02 - 21:07)
wasn't pay you didn't but but destiny it (21:04 - 21:09)
was in destiny 1. there were those (21:07 - 21:12)
stupid things oh my god in destiny 1 (21:09 - 21:15)
they had they introduced because destiny (21:12 - 21:17)
1 was like four years long i think three (21:15 - 21:18)
or four years long and then after like (21:17 - 21:20)
two years they introduced emotes and (21:18 - 21:22)
like emotes were anywhere between like (21:20 - 21:23)
what (21:22 - 21:26)
three bucks to like 15 bucks but it was (21:23 - 21:27)
pretty there was there wasn't that many (21:26 - 21:29)
15 bucks ones (21:27 - 21:31)
and i wanted to have all of them because (21:29 - 21:34)
they were so they were cheap enough (21:31 - 21:36)
where they would do like maybe (21:34 - 21:37)
um (21:36 - 21:39)
you know 10 new emotes every couple (21:37 - 21:40)
months (21:39 - 21:42)
and you'd get a couple for free right (21:40 - 21:44)
they rude drop randomly or whatever or (21:42 - 21:46)
you did some event and you would get one (21:44 - 21:47)
that i would be like well (21:46 - 21:49)
it's only like twenty dollars to get the (21:47 - 21:52)
last four i'm missing and so i got all (21:49 - 21:55)
the emotes in destiny i had every single (21:52 - 21:58)
dance emote (21:55 - 22:00)
destiny was my most played game and (21:58 - 22:01)
destiny had the promise of this was (22:00 - 22:04)
going to be a 10-year game and destiny 2 (22:01 - 22:06)
was coming and the huge thing was oh (22:04 - 22:08)
nothing transferred from destiny 1 to (22:06 - 22:11)
destiny 2. you had to start all over (22:08 - 22:13)
and (22:11 - 22:15)
that turned me off and i (22:13 - 22:17)
i think that's what turned me off from (22:15 - 22:19)
like apex and destiny 2 of buying (22:17 - 22:21)
cosmetics you know i've bought and i've (22:19 - 22:24)
purchased maybe four cosmetics in (22:21 - 22:27)
destiny 2. um whether i think most of (22:24 - 22:29)
them were like on discount because (22:27 - 22:31)
they'll have like sales (22:29 - 22:33)
but (22:31 - 22:35)
the argument is like well if these skins (22:33 - 22:37)
weren't 20 in apex if they were 10 i'd (22:35 - 22:39)
be more likely to buy it (22:37 - 22:40)
but (22:39 - 22:42)
why is that an argument now you wait for (22:40 - 22:44)
what but clearly by their price point (22:42 - 22:47)
but clearly respawn (22:44 - 22:48)
if they weren't making money at twenty (22:47 - 22:50)
dollars of skin they would have changed (22:48 - 22:52)
it they're clearly do it's been two (22:50 - 22:53)
years (22:52 - 22:55)
it's working whatever they're doing is (22:53 - 22:56)
working (22:55 - 22:59)
so i think the other part of the problem (22:56 - 23:02)
too greg is when you and i were growing (22:59 - 23:04)
up we were like when i turn 18 i'm (23:02 - 23:06)
getting out of this house and i'm gonna (23:04 - 23:08)
go live in my own life on my own and (23:06 - 23:11)
folks today are like i'm 40 years old (23:08 - 23:13)
and living in my parents basement and (23:11 - 23:15)
that's just fine because i've got all (23:13 - 23:17)
these skins (23:15 - 23:20)
i have all the apex skins (23:17 - 23:23)
but this this applies to things outside (23:20 - 23:25)
like will said with cards like i i was (23:23 - 23:27)
the tcg player that i had all hollow (23:25 - 23:29)
energies i had all hollow trainers i (23:27 - 23:32)
look at the room you're in you're a fool (23:29 - 23:34)
i know (23:32 - 23:38)
money should never go to you (23:34 - 23:41)
good call valid (23:38 - 23:42)
i'm just saying if there's a forty (23:41 - 23:43)
dollar crime rat skin i'd probably buy (23:42 - 23:44)
it (23:43 - 23:46)
we know cause you are a (23:44 - 23:48)
sucker (23:46 - 23:49)
but i i (23:48 - 23:50)
i haven't even bought all the characters (23:49 - 23:52)
any night i have i haven't either i have (23:50 - 23:55)
zero desire to play talonflame i have (23:52 - 23:57)
zero desire to play snorlax i don't care (23:55 - 23:59)
about playing pikachu (23:57 - 24:01)
five year old yeah five years three (23:59 - 24:03)
five well yeah okay i was just using an (24:01 - 24:06)
example five years ago (24:03 - 24:08)
i probably would have been that person (24:06 - 24:09)
that was like well i need to unlock all (24:08 - 24:11)
the characters because i need to have (24:09 - 24:12)
them all unlocked (24:11 - 24:14)
but like but in the reality i'm never (24:12 - 24:16)
going to play little guys so they could (24:14 - 24:17)
sit there (24:16 - 24:20)
yeah right like i don't even have i i (24:17 - 24:23)
was such in a completionist mindset (24:20 - 24:25)
however many years ago that i i felt (24:23 - 24:28)
that i needed to own everything and i (24:25 - 24:30)
think it was mostly destiny one that (24:28 - 24:31)
knocked me out of that i mean world of (24:30 - 24:33)
warcraft killed that for me because i (24:31 - 24:35)
bought every collector's edition (24:33 - 24:38)
i bought all of the things and (24:35 - 24:39)
like why (24:38 - 24:42)
why did they give them this money (24:39 - 24:44)
why (24:42 - 24:44)
so i could get a statue that is (24:44 - 24:48)
literally clogging in my house that i'm (24:47 - 24:51)
like i need to get rid of this it is so (24:48 - 24:53)
meaningless to me at this point it is (24:51 - 24:57)
such a temporary fix for (24:53 - 24:58)
all of the other problems that i'm (24:57 - 24:59)
ignoring (24:58 - 25:01)
retail therapy is a bad thing i am a (24:59 - 25:05)
very big retail therapy person like (25:01 - 25:08)
there's a new dungeon dragon's book out (25:05 - 25:10)
that had i got for free i got the (25:08 - 25:12)
digital version for free (25:10 - 25:14)
and i'm still thinking do i want the alt (25:12 - 25:17)
cover so it can literally sit back there (25:14 - 25:20)
and i will never look at the alt cover (25:17 - 25:22)
never it will sit i don't even have the (25:20 - 25:23)
covers out (25:22 - 25:26)
it's all the spines (25:23 - 25:29)
yeah i i have i've i've given up this (25:26 - 25:31)
collector's lifestyle (25:29 - 25:33)
because it hurts but also there's all (25:31 - 25:35)
sorts of stuff in boxes in my house and (25:33 - 25:37)
i'm like (25:35 - 25:38)
why (25:37 - 25:41)
there's night goes away (25:38 - 25:41)
i (25:41 - 25:43)
i lose it (25:41 - 25:46)
for 40 dollars yeah for my second (25:43 - 25:48)
character (25:46 - 25:50)
not a good argument but i would rather (25:48 - 25:52)
them have 40 skins that they're making (25:50 - 25:54)
money off of than to have the pay to win (25:52 - 25:57)
that they have right now oh yeah if if (25:54 - 25:59)
this was 40 and were killing all the pay (25:57 - 26:01)
to win items (25:59 - 26:02)
that would have been one thing but they (26:01 - 26:05)
didn't they added three new items (26:02 - 26:07)
they gave you things like a hair but (26:05 - 26:10)
also here's three new items that fyi (26:07 - 26:11)
nobody knows how to use yet (26:10 - 26:14)
but they probably made them real good so (26:11 - 26:16)
uh guess what now you have to level (26:14 - 26:18)
these because it's completely changed (26:16 - 26:21)
the field also here's a 40 skin (26:18 - 26:23)
also here's a new character blastoise (26:21 - 26:26)
super powerful here's mama's wine (26:23 - 26:28)
garbage (26:26 - 26:29)
but sylvia will probably be scary also (26:28 - 26:31)
sylveon comes out this week sylvian (26:29 - 26:34)
comes out this week (26:31 - 26:34)
like i i i hate that this is the pricing (26:34 - 26:39)
structure of these free-to-play games (26:37 - 26:41)
but the reality is we live in a world (26:39 - 26:43)
where games are free to play and they're (26:41 - 26:44)
seasonal and like every game has a (26:43 - 26:47)
battle pass and i completely forgot that (26:44 - 26:48)
until we brought up apex that i have (26:47 - 26:52)
purchased every battle pass to apex (26:48 - 26:53)
and that is (26:52 - 26:55)
eight seasons ten dollars each or eight (26:53 - 26:56)
dollars each however much of battle (26:55 - 26:58)
passes in apex (26:56 - 27:01)
and (26:58 - 27:02)
these companies are releasing different (27:01 - 27:05)
things because eventually even if you (27:02 - 27:07)
say no no i'm not doing this they will (27:05 - 27:10)
hook you with something (27:07 - 27:11)
um (27:10 - 27:14)
or most people (27:11 - 27:14)
i mean they run the risk they it it is (27:14 - 27:18)
it is not (27:17 - 27:20)
without its (27:18 - 27:22)
if you're never going to buy a 40 (27:20 - 27:24)
nine tail skin but they release 10 more (27:22 - 27:26)

wine.com (38:38 - 38:41)

sites why (38:41 - 38:45)
yeah mom used to subscribe to that (38:43 - 38:46)
magazine too (38:45 - 38:49)
pokemon oreos are listed on ebay for (38:46 - 38:52)
thousands of dollars (38:49 - 38:52)
look we have covered this do not buy (38:53 - 39:00)
sketchy cookies from ebay no need to go (38:57 - 39:02)
further it is a false (39:00 - 39:06)
it's false it's fake don't do it (39:02 - 39:08)
just let it go do not order any food (39:06 - 39:12)

vitamins no no buy them and do what i (39:23 - 39:29)
did eat them you just eat it (39:26 - 39:31)
it tastes just like every other pokemon (39:29 - 39:34)
oreo (39:31 - 39:34)
uh so uh somewhat of a very clickbaity (39:36 - 39:41)
title here i'm gonna skip most of the (39:38 - 39:44)
article uh where they (39:41 - 39:47)
they they uh they talk about doritos and (39:44 - 39:49)
cheetos selling for quite a bit of money (39:47 - 39:52)
then they talk about how oreo just (39:49 - 39:53)
launched this cookie with pokemon they (39:52 - 39:55)
talk about how they're 16 pokemon (39:53 - 39:58)
cookies and then we get to the actual (39:55 - 40:01)
meat and potatoes of the article (39:58 - 40:04)
uh and which is the last paragraph here (40:01 - 40:07)
it says a search for a pokemon mew oreo (40:04 - 40:09)
on ebay reveals that cookies have been (40:07 - 40:12)
posted on the site for as high as 25 000 (40:09 - 40:14)
though anyone can put up something on (40:12 - 40:15)
sale for ebay the tricky part is (40:14 - 40:17)
actually selling it but a quick peek (40:15 - 40:20)
into sold listings reveal that the 25 (40:17 - 40:23)
000 is an outlandish price and cookies (40:20 - 40:26)
do uh the cookies do appear to be (40:23 - 40:28)
getting snatched up at a premium uh even (40:26 - 40:30)
one has been listed to sold for fifteen (40:28 - 40:32)
thousand one hundred dollars although (40:30 - 40:35)
i'm a bit skeptical the author of this (40:32 - 40:37)
article that that particular one was on (40:35 - 40:40)
the up and up plenty of other cookies (40:37 - 40:42)
sell for about one dollar to ten dollars (40:40 - 40:44)
which seems more accurate price of their (40:42 - 40:46)
representation (40:44 - 40:47)
um (40:46 - 40:49)
and that's pretty much the article (40:47 - 40:50)
so (40:49 - 40:51)
okay (40:50 - 40:54)
quick i am on ebay right now (40:51 - 40:58)

give us a punchy headline how do we get (41:51 - 41:55)
somebody wrote that punchy headlight but (41:53 - 41:56)
i do have just was given an assignment (41:55 - 41:58)
by the editor saying look (41:56 - 42:00)
pokemon's hot right now oreos did a (41:58 - 42:03)
thing come up with an angle you have (42:00 - 42:06)
three hours go (42:03 - 42:09)
pokemon's hot right now (42:06 - 42:11)
but i will give mike credit because he (42:09 - 42:14)
clearly understood ebay and understood (42:11 - 42:15)
the (42:14 - 42:17)
like (42:15 - 42:18)
people people this this is the problem (42:17 - 42:20)
with um (42:18 - 42:23)
this is the problem (42:20 - 42:23)
the actual issue is people just read a (42:23 - 42:27)
headline and then they assume that like (42:25 - 42:29)
wow these cookies are selling for ten (42:27 - 42:31)
thousand dollars uh when (42:29 - 42:32)
at least in this article it does (42:31 - 42:34)
actually say that no these cookies are (42:32 - 42:36)
selling between one and ten dollars (42:34 - 42:37)
well i'll say this again we've set this (42:36 - 42:40)
on the show just because something sold (42:37 - 42:42)
on ebay for a price doesn't actually (42:40 - 42:45)
mean that somebody bought it (42:42 - 42:47)
right like there is there was one time (42:45 - 42:48)
in my twitch stream where somebody said (42:47 - 42:50)
you can't bid on ebay because if you (42:48 - 42:53)
don't pay they'll sue you no that's not (42:50 - 42:56)
how ebay works there is no (42:53 - 42:58)
obligation for you to pay anything the (42:56 - 43:01)
the worst thing that can happen (42:58 - 43:04)
is ebay bans your account there's like (43:01 - 43:05)
no (43:04 - 43:08)
the the ebay police are not kicking down (43:05 - 43:10)
your door because you spent (43:08 - 43:12)
50 on an ancient mew on ebay and you (43:10 - 43:15)
didn't pay the person you bought it from (43:12 - 43:17)
there is no ebay pulley fyi there's no (43:15 - 43:20)
ebay police (43:17 - 43:23)
you could you could spend ten thousand (43:20 - 43:25)
dollars on a cookie and not pay just (43:23 - 43:28)
because you're like this was funny (43:25 - 43:29)
like (43:28 - 43:31)
what no so you're not spending ten (43:29 - 43:33)
thousand dollars you could get the (43:31 - 43:35)
winning ten thousand dollar bid and then (43:33 - 43:38)
just not finalize the transaction (43:35 - 43:39)
correct (43:38 - 43:42)
and you'll get like a bad star on ebay (43:39 - 43:44)
and then they'll ban your account and (43:42 - 43:46)
then 30 days later you can make a new (43:44 - 43:48)
account and it's fine (43:46 - 43:51)
it's it's all fine it's like the the (43:48 - 43:52)
amount of people that don't understand (43:51 - 43:54)
how ebay like i can just tell that (43:52 - 43:56)
somebody's never bought anything on ebay (43:54 - 43:57)
because they have these outlandish (43:56 - 43:59)
things uh it's like the people that are (43:57 - 44:02)
like well i don't i can't buy (43:59 - 44:03)
uh (44:02 - 44:04)
an original (44:03 - 44:06)
jungle booster pack on ebay what if it's (44:04 - 44:10)
a scam yeah the dude with 40 000 items (44:06 - 44:13)
sold on ebay is gonna no his entire (44:10 - 44:16)
livelihood is built on this website the (44:13 - 44:18)
last thing he wants to do is get his (44:16 - 44:20)
ebay account flagged like there's so (44:18 - 44:24)
much dedication to somebody who has (44:20 - 44:26)
thousands of transactions on ebay like (44:24 - 44:27)
they are they are in it for the long (44:26 - 44:29)
haul the thing that that kills me (44:27 - 44:32)
actually i don't know if you saw this (44:29 - 44:33)
are the uh (44:32 - 44:35)
the card scams on amazon (44:33 - 44:38)
oh yeah where you buy sealed product (44:35 - 44:40)
from amazon and it's basically somebody (44:38 - 44:43)
bought it yeah opened it took all the (44:40 - 44:45)
good cards yeah (44:43 - 44:48)
and then did it as a return to amazon so (44:45 - 44:50)
amazon's like oh it's a return they (44:48 - 44:52)
didn't use it so we can just sell it (44:50 - 44:53)
yeah yeah (44:52 - 44:55)
that's the that's the real skill that's (44:53 - 44:57)
scary to me (44:55 - 44:59)
that can't exist on ebay but that's not (44:57 - 45:01)
going to exist on ebay from like a (44:59 - 45:02)
verified (45:01 - 45:05)
20 000 exactly right yeah yeah on amazon (45:02 - 45:06)
it's the wild oh it's the wild west over (45:05 - 45:09)
there amazon amazon don't care they're (45:06 - 45:10)
not those things (45:09 - 45:12)
employees are not getting paid enough to (45:10 - 45:14)
check to see if something they're all (45:12 - 45:15)
they're all working for two dollars (45:14 - 45:17)
while they're watching their super chief (45:15 - 45:19)
fly into space (45:17 - 45:21)
what do they care about their product or (45:19 - 45:23)
their customers so even that though an (45:21 - 45:25)
oreo sold for fifteen thousand one (45:23 - 45:27)
hundred dollars i agree with what was (45:25 - 45:29)
his name mike mike (45:27 - 45:30)
there's no proof that that actually went (45:29 - 45:33)
through like why would one person pay 15 (45:30 - 45:35)
000 when you can see (45:33 - 45:37)
hundreds of well not hundreds but maybe (45:35 - 45:40)
like 20 30 40 50 completed auctions of a (45:37 - 45:42)
cookie selling for like six bucks didn't (45:40 - 45:44)
even come with an ancient mew it didn't (45:42 - 45:46)
come with an hmi so why would you pay (45:44 - 45:48)
that kind of money anyways to all my (45:46 - 45:50)
family and friends who don't listen to (45:48 - 45:51)
this program stop sending me these (45:50 - 45:53)
articles about cookies selling for ten (45:51 - 45:56)
thousand dollars that's not true (45:53 - 45:56)
see this is why nobody in my family does (45:57 - 46:01)
this to me because they they they aren't (45:59 - 46:04)
running for the blistering response (46:01 - 46:05)
they're like yeah i'm sure he knows (46:04 - 46:08)
about it (46:05 - 46:08)
um (46:08 - 46:12)
off pokemon.com encounter alola regions (46:09 - 46:13)
roll it litten popplio and max ray (46:12 - 46:16)
battles this is really cool (46:13 - 46:17)
it's over (46:16 - 46:20)
it's over zero heads up like always it's (46:17 - 46:23)
infuriating uh (46:20 - 46:24)
this was the first time you would be (46:23 - 46:27)
able to catch raw lit litten and popplio (46:24 - 46:30)
in anything other than a pokeball (46:27 - 46:32)
um (46:30 - 46:33)
because there was no way to catch them (46:32 - 46:34)
before (46:33 - 46:35)
possibly shiny (46:34 - 46:39)
and with hidden abilities (46:35 - 46:39)
but there was no increase shiny for this (46:40 - 46:46)
no i think it's possible (46:42 - 46:46)
anything (46:46 - 46:50)
i thought they could be shiny they also (46:47 - 46:52)
since i spent literally a weekend trying (46:50 - 46:54)
to get the hidden abilities and luxury (46:52 - 46:55)
balls (46:54 - 46:58)
i now have a set of all three in luxury (46:55 - 47:00)
you need the ability you already have a (46:58 - 47:01)
hidden ability just put that one in the (47:00 - 47:03)
thing with the luxury ball and then (47:01 - 47:04)
breed it down (47:03 - 47:05)
because (47:04 - 47:08)
i needed something to do this weekend oh (47:05 - 47:10)
buddy (47:08 - 47:12)
i had stuff we could have been doing (47:10 - 47:14)
look i had stuff i was like (47:12 - 47:16)
friday night i was out at magic it was a (47:14 - 47:20)
great time but my body said guess what (47:16 - 47:21)
you just had surgery and you are staying (47:20 - 47:24)
home on saturday because you're wrecked (47:21 - 47:27)
and what did i do with my time i hunted (47:24 - 47:30)
the lowland starters and raidens (47:27 - 47:32)
hey it was a cool event it was very (47:30 - 47:34)
short no heads up a little frustrating (47:32 - 47:38)
on that end um (47:34 - 47:40)
again i'll say this every time it's one (47:38 - 47:42)
of the things niantic does better than (47:40 - 47:44)
game freak is at least they give us like (47:42 - 47:46)
two weeks heads up for these events (47:44 - 47:48)
at least we we knew we knew about disco (47:46 - 47:50)
community a month ago (47:48 - 47:54)
like you can plan take off move some (47:50 - 47:55)
stuff around (47:54 - 47:56)
uh (47:55 - 47:58)
it's just kick (47:56 - 48:02)
events should be on like (47:58 - 48:04)
let me know about this event (48:02 - 48:06)
i would like to plan for your event (48:04 - 48:09)
i would like to set some time up to (48:06 - 48:12)
participate in your video game (48:09 - 48:15)
not everyone can just drop everything (48:12 - 48:17)
and go catch a million possible you get (48:15 - 48:19)
for having a life (48:17 - 48:23)
how dare um okay (48:19 - 48:26)
so there were two new trailers that were (48:23 - 48:28)
dropped one for brilliant diamond (48:26 - 48:30)
shining pearl one for (48:28 - 48:33)
legends of arceus uh oddly enough these (48:30 - 48:34)
seemed like they could have both been (48:33 - 48:37)
included in the nintendo direct and true (48:34 - 48:38)
did not because they were not any (48:37 - 48:40)
they're not really that exciting of (48:38 - 48:44)
trailers um speak for yourself (48:40 - 48:47)
i was very excited the legends arcus (48:44 - 48:50)
stuff looks fantastic (48:47 - 48:52)
okay well let's start there (48:50 - 48:53)
uh (48:52 - 48:57)
so they showed off a couple things here (48:53 - 48:58)
let's see i'll just we'll just go (48:57 - 49:00)
through the press release uh the pokemon (48:58 - 49:02)
alleges arceus brings players to the (49:00 - 49:05)
vast history region this this is the (49:02 - 49:07)
central region as it existed in the past (49:05 - 49:08)
long before familiar towns and (49:07 - 49:10)
cityscapes of diamond and pearl were (49:08 - 49:12)
established rich in nature and with (49:10 - 49:14)
mount cornet towering at its heart this (49:12 - 49:17)
is cinno um unlike anything players have (49:14 - 49:19)
ever experienced before and they will (49:17 - 49:20)
embark on a journey to complete the (49:19 - 49:22)
region's first pokedex (49:20 - 49:25)
um and so uh the first bullet point here (49:22 - 49:29)
is your arc phone will be your guide (49:25 - 49:31)
this is where we got this is where i (49:29 - 49:33)
went off the rails i've been off the (49:31 - 49:35)
rails ever since this was (49:33 - 49:37)
this was put out (49:35 - 49:40)
they're very advanced okay (49:37 - 49:43)
okay (49:40 - 49:43)
what time in the past (49:43 - 49:47)
are we (49:46 - 49:49)
if we have (49:47 - 49:52)
a cell phone i will admit as a person (49:49 - 49:54)
who works in the cell phone industry (49:52 - 49:56)
cell phones existed long before people (49:54 - 49:59)
thought they did but that was still (49:56 - 50:01)
1946 (49:59 - 50:02)
not (50:01 - 50:06)
18 something as they suggest this (50:02 - 50:10)
series is set in unless unless (50:06 - 50:13)
this series is in 1940 and the pokemon (50:10 - 50:16)
games of modern are like the year three (50:13 - 50:18)
thousand and then (50:16 - 50:19)
the future (50:18 - 50:21)
i can answer this (50:19 - 50:23)
hoopa opened a ring (50:21 - 50:27)
threw the cell phone through the ring (50:23 - 50:27)
if you wrote a story and said hoopa did (50:33 - 50:38)
it you would be raked over the cold (50:36 - 50:41)
also if we don't even if we've never (50:38 - 50:44)
been in this town before where the cell (50:41 - 50:45)
who built the cell towers to make your (50:44 - 50:48)
phone work who put in the infrastructure (50:45 - 50:50)
where there's no satellites how is your (50:48 - 50:52)
phone working (50:50 - 50:54)
all right i got an answer from the rotom (50:52 - 50:56)
phone had wrote tom in it does the (50:54 - 50:58)
arceus phone have arceus in it i have an (50:56 - 51:01)
answer for this you don't you have (50:58 - 51:04)
you made up satellites and then hoopa (51:01 - 51:06)
opened the ring and they pushed the (51:04 - 51:09)
satellite to the ring (51:06 - 51:11)
is this is this a team galactic plot (51:09 - 51:13)
they're like let's pollute the past with (51:11 - 51:15)
technology (51:13 - 51:17)
early on your adventure (51:15 - 51:19)
what year is it (51:17 - 51:21)
players will get a device called the arc (51:19 - 51:23)
phone it's distinctive appearance might (51:21 - 51:26)
lead one to suspect it somehow has a (51:23 - 51:28)
connection to the mythical pokemon (51:26 - 51:30)
arceus this device (51:28 - 51:33)
seems to have some certain sort of (51:30 - 51:35)
strange power and will help players uh (51:33 - 51:37)
on their journey okay i'll say it as a (51:35 - 51:39)
strange part it's connecting a stealth (51:37 - 51:41)
service that doesn't exist it's got a (51:39 - 51:44)
rotom in it it doesn't it's an arceus (51:41 - 51:45)
phone (51:44 - 51:47)
special pokemon with mysterious powers (51:45 - 51:49)
during their expeditions players may run (51:47 - 51:51)
into pokemon that are larger than normal (51:49 - 51:53)
and have glowing red eyes these are (51:51 - 51:56)
known as alpha pokemon they are stronger (51:53 - 51:57)
than their regular counterparts and they (51:56 - 51:59)
will be quite aggressive in chasing down (51:57 - 52:00)
and attacking players that stray too (51:59 - 52:02)
close (52:00 - 52:03)
there are also special pokemon in the (52:02 - 52:06)
his region that have received some sort (52:03 - 52:08)
of mysterious blessing some of these (52:06 - 52:11)
pokemon are particularly powerful and (52:08 - 52:13)
have been come to known as nobles while (52:11 - 52:16)
others said they are willing to assist (52:13 - 52:18)
the people in the region each of these (52:16 - 52:20)
pokemons seem to hold the power not held (52:18 - 52:21)
by regular pokemon (52:20 - 52:25)
people known as wardens are tasked with (52:21 - 52:26)
looking after these pokemon by (52:25 - 52:28)
performing duties such as (52:26 - 52:30)
uh making sure noble's territories (52:28 - 52:33)
remain unviolated or providing offerings (52:30 - 52:34)
of food and water (52:33 - 52:36)
these pokemon nobles (52:34 - 52:38)
are re revered (52:36 - 52:41)
by by the people in the region but some (52:38 - 52:43)
strange phenomenon is now causing them (52:41 - 52:45)
to suddenly fly into a frenzy (52:43 - 52:48)
uh the causes for the incidents is still (52:45 - 52:50)
shrouded in mystery once frenzied these (52:48 - 52:52)
pokemon are incredibly incredibly (52:50 - 52:55)
difficult to reign in which forces the (52:52 - 52:57)
people of the hisui region to turn to (52:55 - 53:00)
the galaxy expedition team for help as (52:57 - 53:03)
part of the survey corpse you will be (53:00 - 53:05)
called upon to quell the frenzy of (53:03 - 53:07)
nobles (53:05 - 53:07)
um (53:08 - 53:12)
monster hunter pokemon cross over to me (53:10 - 53:15)
so then they introduced cleaver the axe (53:12 - 53:16)
pokemon (53:15 - 53:17)
bug rock type (53:16 - 53:19)
special minerals found in the jesui (53:17 - 53:21)
region caused scyther to evolve into (53:19 - 53:22)
this pokemon there you go that at least (53:21 - 53:25)
makes sense greg uh part of its body (53:22 - 53:26)
have been hardened to stone the stone (53:25 - 53:29)
also gets chipped during fierce battle (53:26 - 53:30)
and cleaver (53:29 - 53:32)
that uh and cleaver that have survived (53:30 - 53:34)
many battles will display large chips (53:32 - 53:36)
across their body it is said that the (53:34 - 53:38)
people in the hisooy region use pieces (53:36 - 53:41)
of stone to craft tools (53:38 - 53:43)
so we have some answers there (53:41 - 53:45)
yeah apparently one of the pieces done (53:43 - 53:48)
is to make a cell tower is it cleep (53:45 - 53:50)
is it cleaver or clever (53:48 - 53:52)
i'm not sure (53:50 - 53:54)
they don't say it out loud (53:52 - 53:55)
yeah they haven't said it out loud it it (53:54 - 53:58)
it looks like (53:55 - 53:58)
it looks like clever because of the o (54:01 - 54:06)
because it's not an e (54:04 - 54:08)
yeah but i don't know the way you say (54:06 - 54:10)
scissor is scissor like a pair of (54:08 - 54:13)
scissors but some people say size or but (54:10 - 54:15)
it's supposed to be like a pair of so i (54:13 - 54:17)
don't know i'm (54:15 - 54:19)
we'll wait until the anime i guess (54:17 - 54:22)
okay so uh let's back up here (54:19 - 54:23)
um (54:22 - 54:24)
so we have two different things we have (54:23 - 54:27)
uh noble pokemon and then we have alpha (54:24 - 54:28)
pokemon so we've seen alpha pokemon (54:27 - 54:31)
there was like an uh alpha ursa ring and (54:28 - 54:33)
an alpha luxury i think in the original (54:31 - 54:34)
trailer (54:33 - 54:36)
uh i know some people maybe (54:34 - 54:38)
speculated that it could be like shadow (54:36 - 54:40)
pokemon because their eyes were red or (54:38 - 54:41)
something (54:40 - 54:43)
uh and then the noble pokemon kind of (54:41 - 54:46)
seemed like boss battles i guess (54:43 - 54:48)
kind of yeah i mean it's such replacing (54:46 - 54:51)
trials right (54:48 - 54:54)
yeah yeah it seems like to like the gym (54:51 - 54:57)
trial system of go here (54:54 - 54:59)
cleaver seems like the first one maybe (54:57 - 55:01)
this it seems like the first one because (54:59 - 55:02)
the only thing i really learned from (55:01 - 55:04)
this trailer is oshawa doesn't evolve (55:02 - 55:07)
until 17 yeah because the oshawa was 16 (55:04 - 55:10)
in the trailer and the cleaver was 18 (55:07 - 55:11)
and i was like wait why isn't the sasha (55:10 - 55:12)
what involved yet and i was like oh (55:11 - 55:14)
maybe they chose not to evolve it (55:12 - 55:16)
because it's really cute (55:14 - 55:19)
duat is at 17 will but you could you hit (55:16 - 55:22)
b he was only at 16 though he wasn't (55:19 - 55:24)
there yet oh (55:22 - 55:27)
he wasn't the thing can we as a society (55:24 - 55:29)
stop using alpha since (55:27 - 55:31)
that that came from the alpha wolf thing (55:29 - 55:34)
and it turns out that that science paper (55:31 - 55:36)
was complete garbage no i mean alpha is (55:34 - 55:38)
just the first letter of the greek (55:36 - 55:39)
alphabet (55:38 - 55:41)
yeah it's the first it's the first squad (55:39 - 55:43)
to die and then beta squad has to come (55:41 - 55:45)
in it's super angry and they're super (55:43 - 55:47)
protective that's not what alpha is just (55:45 - 55:50)
the first letter it's the first one (55:47 - 55:52)
the whole alpha wolf thing is garbage a (55:50 - 55:54)
lot of people just use it to mean like (55:52 - 55:55)
the top (55:54 - 55:58)
top what about the alpha lion (55:55 - 56:00)
because they they use it for gorillas (55:58 - 56:02)
and everything too they just like any (56:00 - 56:05)
kind of a pack yeah (56:02 - 56:05)
and the wolf thing was wrong yeah but (56:05 - 56:10)
it's become common parlance now so yeah (56:07 - 56:11)
but it shouldn't be (56:10 - 56:15)
excise it from society (56:11 - 56:15)
okay (56:17 - 56:21)
so open up koopa (56:18 - 56:24)
go back in time (56:21 - 56:26)
get rid of the alpha it's steampunk it's (56:24 - 56:27)
okay (56:26 - 56:28)
um (56:27 - 56:31)
how do we feel about cleaver he's okay i (56:28 - 56:33)
i i like split evolution i'm glad they (56:31 - 56:35)
didn't completely yeah (56:33 - 56:37)
um (56:35 - 56:39)
i actually really kind of like the (56:37 - 56:42)
design it's very futile looking (56:39 - 56:45)
which i i i kind of like (56:42 - 56:47)
like even though we're apparently (56:45 - 56:49)
in the 1980s when cell phones were (56:47 - 56:50)
plentiful (56:49 - 56:51)
uh (56:50 - 56:53)
i i do think it's a very cool design i (56:51 - 56:55)
think it fits (56:53 - 56:59)
the scyther line like i think it it (56:55 - 57:01)
doesn't look like you know when to what (56:59 - 57:03)
goes to sam rotten you're like (57:01 - 57:04)
what (57:03 - 57:07)
uh i think this i think is a really good (57:04 - 57:09)
cool looking design i'm not overly (57:07 - 57:10)
thrilled about the bug rock type but (57:09 - 57:13)
whatever (57:10 - 57:13)
well (57:13 - 57:14)
because (57:13 - 57:17)
since seizor is bugged steel and they (57:14 - 57:19)
don't have steel (57:17 - 57:21)
that's why it has to be rock i'm sure (57:19 - 57:23)
they have steel (57:21 - 57:26)
they made a phone (57:23 - 57:28)
that's made with precious metals not a (57:26 - 57:30)
steel (57:28 - 57:32)
it also seems like (57:30 - 57:35)
this is you know your first or second (57:32 - 57:37)
boss battle i again i don't know if i (57:35 - 57:38)
like the word boss battle but that's (57:37 - 57:41)
what it seems like it is and then (57:38 - 57:44)
first right like (57:41 - 57:44)
if it means it has like a it has like a (57:44 - 57:47)
a (57:47 - 57:50)
health like a four-part health bar above (57:47 - 57:51)
it yeah (57:50 - 57:54)
um it seems very much (57:51 - 57:55)
like (57:54 - 57:57)
maybe it's moves or something changes (57:55 - 58:00)
when it gets to the halfway or one third (57:57 - 58:01)
of the way this is i mean this is a very (58:00 - 58:03)
common video game trope (58:01 - 58:05)
they have different levels of like they (58:03 - 58:07)
do their move set changes halfway (58:05 - 58:08)
through otherwise it would be a very (58:07 - 58:11)
boring battle or whatever and at some (58:08 - 58:12)
point you have to throw a pouch of (58:11 - 58:14)
something at it because they really made (58:12 - 58:16)
sure to zoom in on that pouch yeah that (58:14 - 58:20)
popped in the air (58:16 - 58:20)
so maybe this is the answer to there's (58:22 - 58:26)
no gyms but there will be these nobles (58:24 - 58:28)
and you gotta do the nobles i'm sure i (58:26 - 58:30)
may i would wager to guess there would (58:28 - 58:32)
be optional nobles (58:30 - 58:34)
um that you don't have to do my some (58:32 - 58:36)
might be harder than others why why (58:34 - 58:38)
would there be optional ones it's like a (58:36 - 58:41)
very like final fantasy slash yeah (58:38 - 58:44)
jrpg where there's like (58:41 - 58:46)
there's a couple that are stranded (58:44 - 58:48)
somewhere that are completely optional i (58:46 - 58:50)
would say like the alpha pokemon or the (58:48 - 58:53)
optionals but the nobles you have to do (58:50 - 58:56)
yeah that could be yeah (58:53 - 58:58)
um okay so getting out of the second (58:56 - 59:02)
part race uh across sprawling untamed (58:58 - 59:03)
landscapes (59:02 - 59:05)
with riding pokemon during their (59:03 - 59:07)
adventures players will re receive the (59:05 - 59:11)
celeste celestial celestical flute i (59:07 - 59:12)
don't know how to say that word (59:11 - 59:14)
uh this mysterious instrument that has (59:12 - 59:16)
been passed down from generation to (59:14 - 59:19)
generation of hisoui people play the (59:16 - 59:20)
flute anywhere to so many special (59:19 - 59:22)
pokemon that lets you ride them (59:20 - 59:24)
riding these pokemon will allow people (59:22 - 59:26)
allow players to move faster on land (59:24 - 59:28)
uh or across body of waters or soar (59:26 - 59:30)
through the skies (59:28 - 59:32)
weird deer has powerful sturdy legs (59:30 - 59:34)
riding while riding upon will allow (59:32 - 59:36)
players to gallop through the land at (59:34 - 59:37)
great speed and jump over obstacles (59:36 - 59:39)
basket legion will allow players to be (59:37 - 59:41)
on its back traveling across body of (59:39 - 59:43)
waters also able to launch himself out (59:41 - 59:46)
of the water letting players leap (59:43 - 59:49)
effortlessly over obstacles and (59:46 - 59:51)
hissuian bravery lets players fly (59:49 - 59:54)
through the sky from the from up in the (59:51 - 59:55)
air players will also get a good look at (59:54 - 59:57)
the lands and what pokemon live down (59:55 - 59:58)
below (59:57 - 60:01)
and what items can be found (59:58 - 60:03)
um so i think the only takeaway through (60:01 - 60:05)
this was that (60:03 - 60:08)
the trainer character threw a pokeball (60:05 - 60:09)
off of the basketball legion and was (60:08 - 60:11)
correct that (60:09 - 60:13)
just wrecked that octopus right in the (60:11 - 60:16)
face (60:13 - 60:17)
uh i'm gonna guess you could probably do (60:16 - 60:19)
that off weird deer in bravery too (60:17 - 60:20)
because i didn't show it i would imagine (60:19 - 60:22)
yes (60:20 - 60:25)
and then the last car flying one (60:22 - 60:28)
yeah maybe the last part is uh (60:25 - 60:30)
players can prepare their for survey (60:28 - 60:33)
work at juba life village (60:30 - 60:36)
there's a cl there's a hairdresser and a (60:33 - 60:38)
clothier clothier and hairdresser (60:36 - 60:39)
players can mix up outfits and (60:38 - 60:41)
hairstyles at the clothier or the (60:39 - 60:42)
hairdresser to choose their looks that (60:41 - 60:44)
was really cool (60:42 - 60:46)
the photography studio players can take (60:44 - 60:47)
pictures alongside their pokemon at the (60:46 - 60:49)
photography studio (60:47 - 60:51)
hoopa must have threw a camera and a (60:49 - 60:53)
cell phone through at the same time look (60:51 - 60:56)
it's just wild it's just that they don't (60:53 - 60:58)
even care the general store and crafts (60:56 - 60:59)
uh (60:58 - 61:01)
if players used up their items on a (60:59 - 61:02)
previous (61:01 - 61:04)
excursion they can replenish their (61:02 - 61:06)
supplies at a general store they can (61:04 - 61:08)
also use in-game currency to buy new (61:06 - 61:10)
crafting recipes and materials from the (61:08 - 61:11)
craftwork (61:10 - 61:15)
and then the pastures the pastures (61:11 - 61:16)
craft ones (61:15 - 61:19)
the pastures are where players can leave (61:16 - 61:20)
pokemon that they have been caught many (61:19 - 61:22)
pokemon that (61:20 - 61:23)
will need to be caught for the pokedex (61:22 - 61:25)
but only six pokemon can be taken along (61:23 - 61:27)
in the party players can choose which (61:25 - 61:28)
are the right pokemon for each mission (61:27 - 61:30)
before heading out on surveys (61:28 - 61:32)
uh at any of the various pokemon camps (61:30 - 61:33)
players can change which pokemon they (61:32 - 61:35)
have in their party or send the pokemon (61:33 - 61:37)
to the pastures (61:35 - 61:39)
i think the passengers is just your pc (61:37 - 61:40)
right yeah (61:39 - 61:42)
you couldn't figure out pc technology (61:40 - 61:45)
but they got a cell phone in a uh (61:42 - 61:48)
photo studio and also (61:45 - 61:51)
the wardens are clearly descendants or (61:48 - 61:53)
ancestors of various people in the (61:51 - 61:54)
future (61:53 - 61:57)
yeah so one of them uh the beyblade kid (61:54 - 62:01)
big beyblade energy kid he has a place (61:57 - 62:03)
he has clay's hat lian has clay's hat (62:01 - 62:06)
mai has marley's hair (62:03 - 62:07)
marley (62:06 - 62:10)
oh the the one with the arcanine (62:07 - 62:12)
yeah pokemon masters marley yeah talk (62:10 - 62:14)
about masters barley (62:12 - 62:15)
the only game she's really known for (62:14 - 62:18)
because you get a million of her (62:15 - 62:18)
uh our zoo (62:19 - 62:26)
are a zoo has mars's hair (62:22 - 62:26)
yeah this (62:30 - 62:35)
i i don't really know who is can looks (62:32 - 62:37)
like they're pretty the pokemon company (62:35 - 62:39)
game freak whoever is in charge of this (62:37 - 62:42)
stuff they're pretty good at like (62:39 - 62:42)
leaving out a lot of stuff (62:44 - 62:49)
well you've got to interpret the signs (62:46 - 62:50)
yeah (62:49 - 62:53)
look at the patterns (62:50 - 62:53)
um (62:55 - 62:59)
i'm gonna say it again (62:56 - 62:59)
these graphics are bad (62:59 - 63:03)
the thing that throws it off for me is (63:06 - 63:11)
is the screenshot of the munchlax with (63:09 - 63:14)
the can uh with the marley hair (63:11 - 63:18)
and how her tights just look so (63:14 - 63:20)
awful (63:18 - 63:23)
like the munchlax looks pretty good (63:20 - 63:25)
the sky looks great the ground texture (63:23 - 63:27)
still looks bad the trees still look bad (63:25 - 63:30)
that's fine but man like her tights like (63:27 - 63:32)
are they're just so pixelated and like (63:30 - 63:34)
static (63:32 - 63:37)
like it's like they applied the the jpeg (63:34 - 63:39)
the jpeg but they should have implied (63:37 - 63:40)
like uh (63:39 - 63:44)
that's a properly scaling png yeah (63:40 - 63:46)
it's like they just messed up the file (63:44 - 63:48)
format her like her hair her face looks (63:46 - 63:51)
great like if you look at her her head (63:48 - 63:52)
and her hair and the lighting on her (63:51 - 63:54)
hair that all looks great and then the (63:52 - 63:55)
more you go down her body and you get to (63:54 - 63:58)
her like legs and like the bottom of her (63:55 - 63:59)
dress you're like what happened there (63:58 - 64:01)
why does that look so bad i don't know (63:59 - 64:03)
i'm being very all right male gaze maybe (64:01 - 64:06)
stop going down her body yeah just look (64:03 - 64:09)
her in the eyes like you should and stay (64:06 - 64:11)
there because the rest of it isn't for (64:09 - 64:13)
you steve (64:11 - 64:15)
my mistake (64:13 - 64:15)
cleaver looks good (64:18 - 64:22)
cleaver looks great the outfits look (64:20 - 64:24)
cool that you can dress up in yeah the (64:22 - 64:25)
outfits look really really great i'm (64:24 - 64:26)
very happy with the character (64:25 - 64:28)
customization customization yeah there's (64:26 - 64:31)
a buddhu rosalia outfit already and i'm (64:28 - 64:33)
into it that's all i'm gonna wear (64:31 - 64:36)
okay the beyblade energy kid (64:33 - 64:38)
uh (64:36 - 64:39)
he's standing in front of a great a (64:38 - 64:41)
giant tree yep (64:39 - 64:43)
that looks great very happy with the (64:41 - 64:47)
screenshot tree looks good he looks good (64:43 - 64:49)
shadows look great the trees behind that (64:47 - 64:53)
looks great this game is so (64:49 - 64:53)
finished (64:54 - 64:57)
yeah not finished (64:55 - 64:59)
who would have guessed yeah but then you (64:57 - 65:01)
okay so you go from beyblade energy in (64:59 - 65:02)
front of the tree and then you go to the (65:01 - 65:05)
screenshot where the bravery is in the (65:02 - 65:07)
sky you're flying and you see two lakes (65:05 - 65:08)
and it looks (65:07 - 65:11)
awful the water looks awful the ground (65:08 - 65:14)
looks awful the world is completely (65:11 - 65:17)
empty you can see two bee doos badus (65:14 - 65:20)
and then you can see like one giant (65:17 - 65:22)
crystal rock over to the right hand side (65:20 - 65:23)
obviously you can go mine that crystal (65:22 - 65:24)
rock (65:23 - 65:25)
um (65:24 - 65:27)
this and this looks terrible this looks (65:25 - 65:29)
awful (65:27 - 65:32)
it's as if it's not done yet (65:29 - 65:33)
okay (65:32 - 65:36)
not engaging no this is it to me it (65:33 - 65:38)
looks beautiful (65:36 - 65:39)
we said this about sword and shield and (65:38 - 65:40)
sword and shield ship pretty much (65:39 - 65:44)
exactly like it looked (65:40 - 65:45)
the wild area looked bad and all those (65:44 - 65:47)
trailers in the wild area continued to (65:45 - 65:50)
look bad when it arrived (65:47 - 65:52)
i know that they can do (65:50 - 65:54)
cities looking good they prove that in (65:52 - 65:57)
sword and shield most like the the fairy (65:54 - 65:58)
town and sword and shield looks (65:57 - 66:00)
fantastic (65:58 - 66:02)
it is this open world stuff that they (66:00 - 66:03)
have been (66:02 - 66:06)
clearly unable to figure out (66:03 - 66:08)
how to do it right i think those lakes (66:06 - 66:10)
look fine (66:08 - 66:12)
that water texture looks awful stop (66:10 - 66:13)
no it's because (66:12 - 66:15)
the way the sun is (66:13 - 66:17)
it's uh (66:15 - 66:20)
28. (66:17 - 66:20)
screenshot 28 yeah (66:20 - 66:23)
it's probably the worst screenshot out (66:23 - 66:27)
of all of them (66:25 - 66:30)
but it's not that bad (66:27 - 66:32)
it still looks good (66:30 - 66:34)
yeah screenshot three looks great 28 is (66:32 - 66:36)
we're jumping over water right (66:34 - 66:39)
no 28 is bravery 26 is (66:36 - 66:41)
uh oh wait (66:39 - 66:43)
24 is weird you're over water oh that (66:41 - 66:45)
one's bad too that water's bad too ah (66:43 - 66:46)
what are we looking at (66:45 - 66:48)
28. (66:46 - 66:49)
no (66:48 - 66:52)
bravery flying over the thing is 32. (66:49 - 66:55)
uh you are on some other location (66:52 - 66:59)
i linked it (66:55 - 66:59)
the electivire looks good at 33. (67:00 - 67:07)
lightning effect in 33 looks good (67:03 - 67:07)
it's all good (67:13 - 67:18)
it's all good how are we i'm on the same (67:14 - 67:20)
page and it has different (67:18 - 67:22)
numbers on my other page this makes (67:20 - 67:24)
sense i don't know what's happening over (67:22 - 67:27)
there for you i bought this (67:24 - 67:29)
what (67:27 - 67:30)
it's the same press release but the (67:29 - 67:32)
numbers are different (67:30 - 67:35)
this is garbage (67:32 - 67:35)
i (67:35 - 67:38)
it's fine (67:35 - 67:39)
yeah i mean like yeah at the end of the (67:38 - 67:42)
day it's fine i played i i played (67:39 - 67:45)
through all of sun and moon and all of x (67:42 - 67:48)
and y on a 3ds (67:45 - 67:50)
the graphics obviously not the number (67:48 - 67:52)
one thing on the domes but the 3ds for (67:50 - 67:54)
graphics (67:52 - 67:56)
but i do think that let's go pikachu (67:54 - 67:58)
let's go eevee looked better than this (67:56 - 68:01)
and i understand it was a smaller game (67:58 - 68:03)
you know they were redoing kanto but (68:01 - 68:05)
that game was vibrant that game had (68:03 - 68:08)
great lines maybe i don't i don't know (68:05 - 68:09)
anything about game development i don't (68:08 - 68:11)
know how hard or simple the back end of (68:09 - 68:12)
that was (68:11 - 68:14)
um (68:12 - 68:16)
and i know that there's like an art (68:14 - 68:17)
style they're trying to do with the (68:16 - 68:21)
paint brushes and the like old and (68:17 - 68:24)
japan ways i get (68:21 - 68:27)
a less detailed more of a just pure (68:24 - 68:30)
color experience (68:27 - 68:30)
why are we skipping over what's in the (68:32 - 68:34)
bag (68:33 - 68:37)
what oh yeah i i was there a giant (68:34 - 68:40)
pail of bags and why do you need to whip (68:37 - 68:42)
the bag at pokemon because maybe you're (68:40 - 68:44)
supposed to eat them (68:42 - 68:46)
corn hole or something no it's no nobody (68:44 - 68:49)
likes het bag it's like a cat for (68:46 - 68:52)
pokemon pokey nip (68:49 - 68:54)
oh probably (68:52 - 68:54)
um okay before we go to diamond pearl uh (68:59 - 69:05)
mr joe from mr cereby.net tweeted i (69:02 - 69:07)
don't think this game is open world (69:05 - 69:08)
anymore (69:07 - 69:11)
wow (69:08 - 69:13)
and there you go well (69:11 - 69:16)
define open world (69:13 - 69:19)
that is that that is the definition i (69:16 - 69:21)
believe not in these uh screenshots (69:19 - 69:23)
we're looking at here but in the (69:21 - 69:26)
japanese website they had more map (69:23 - 69:27)
pictures and it's very clear that the (69:26 - 69:30)
map is broken out into sections (69:27 - 69:32)
um (69:30 - 69:34)
and i remember the (69:32 - 69:36)
the (69:34 - 69:38)
we the this is this is going to come off (69:36 - 69:41)
as like i i told you so a moment (69:38 - 69:43)
and it's it's not really i don't i don't (69:41 - 69:44)
ever want to be that i told you so (69:43 - 69:47)
person (69:44 - 69:47)
what are you shaking your head (69:47 - 69:52)
have you met yourself no it's it's not (69:50 - 69:55)
really that it's the fact that like (69:52 - 69:57)
it's the fact that the people that are (69:55 - 69:59)
going to be upset are the people that (69:57 - 70:02)
had these grand expectations (69:59 - 70:04)
and it was like hey maybe don't have (70:02 - 70:05)
those grand expectations and they were (70:04 - 70:06)
like nope (70:05 - 70:09)
broken world and they're like running (70:06 - 70:10)
with it and they're the ones that are (70:09 - 70:12)
gonna be yelling at me (70:10 - 70:15)
that like they're so upset that (70:12 - 70:18)
well like like what did i do i just said (70:15 - 70:20)
hey they didn't use the words open world (70:18 - 70:21)
any time during the press release so (70:20 - 70:25)
when they originally showed this trailer (70:21 - 70:26)
uh (70:25 - 70:28)
and i was like (70:26 - 70:30)
huh they didn't use the word open world (70:28 - 70:31)
right (70:30 - 70:33)
we've had this conversation i went to (70:31 - 70:34)
the press release they didn't use the (70:33 - 70:35)
world open world i went to the japanese (70:34 - 70:36)
press release they didn't use the world (70:35 - 70:38)
open world but if you read twitter if (70:36 - 70:40)
you read reddit if you talk to anyone (70:38 - 70:41)
who watched this trailer they would have (70:40 - 70:43)
been like wow that open world pokemon (70:41 - 70:46)
game looks good and i'm thinking and i'm (70:43 - 70:48)
still thinking there's not a (70:46 - 70:51)
single video game in history (70:48 - 70:52)
that (70:51 - 70:56)
if they were an open world video game (70:52 - 70:59)
they they would tell you yes that (70:56 - 71:02)
i cannot think of a single open world (70:59 - 71:04)
video game that that didn't pound it (71:02 - 71:06)
into your head that they were open world (71:04 - 71:08)
and they never did this and was like (71:06 - 71:09)
okay maybe they're not doing it for the (71:08 - 71:11)
first press release they didn't do it (71:09 - 71:12)
for the second presser i don't know if (71:11 - 71:14)
this is number four or something like (71:12 - 71:14)
that (71:14 - 71:16)
um (71:14 - 71:18)
like i like if it's an open world video (71:16 - 71:19)
game they hit you over the head that (71:18 - 71:20)
it's open world it is literally a (71:19 - 71:22)
selling point to a video game although i (71:20 - 71:24)
will say i don't think every open world (71:22 - 71:25)
video game needs to be open world (71:24 - 71:26)
because there are some bad ones out (71:25 - 71:27)
there (71:26 - 71:29)
um (71:27 - 71:31)
and one of our i can't remember who was (71:29 - 71:32)
somebody from our slack community went (71:31 - 71:33)
into (71:32 - 71:35)
joe's stream joe was streaming like (71:33 - 71:37)
dynamics adventure it was like the week (71:35 - 71:39)
after (71:37 - 71:41)
arceus was shown (71:39 - 71:42)
and uh (71:41 - 71:44)
i can't remember who it was they'll (71:42 - 71:46)
comment on the podcast i'm sure in fact (71:44 - 71:48)
but they they said joe they said hey do (71:46 - 71:51)
you think that this game is open world (71:48 - 71:53)
and joe said of course it is (71:51 - 71:55)
and they said well they didn't say the (71:53 - 71:56)
world open world in the press release (71:55 - 71:58)
and joe stopped his dynomax adventure (71:56 - 72:00)
and said yeah they did and he went to (71:58 - 72:03)
whatever probably the the website and he (72:00 - 72:05)
command f (72:03 - 72:08)
open world and he was like (72:05 - 72:08)
i'm not making this up this is you go (72:08 - 72:11)
back to a stream you can see it and he (72:09 - 72:12)
goes (72:11 - 72:14)
oh i guess they didn't say the world (72:12 - 72:15)
open world i thought they did well it's (72:14 - 72:17)
pretty obvious it's open world and then (72:15 - 72:20)
he like moved on with his stream (72:17 - 72:22)
i totally get why people might have (72:20 - 72:24)
thought that this game was open world (72:22 - 72:27)
but again i look at the other logic of (72:24 - 72:29)
why didn't they say it (72:27 - 72:31)
like every open world game will hit you (72:29 - 72:33)
over the head with this (72:31 - 72:35)
and if you believe and if you're excited (72:33 - 72:36)
that it's open world and now we're (72:35 - 72:39)
getting to the point where it's (72:36 - 72:40)
it could it could still be open world (72:39 - 72:42)
they haven't said i guess it could still (72:40 - 72:44)
be able to say vast (72:42 - 72:46)
yeah (72:44 - 72:46)
and and what actually defines open world (72:46 - 72:50)
yeah like that again (72:49 - 72:52)
this looks (72:50 - 72:54)
more like a monster hunter than a breath (72:52 - 72:56)
of the wild in terms of maps if it's (72:54 - 72:57)
broken into segments but you can go (72:56 - 72:59)
anywhere in those segments however you (72:57 - 73:01)
wish does that suddenly not make it open (72:59 - 73:04)
world because it's broken into segments (73:01 - 73:07)
i would define open world as i can go (73:04 - 73:09)
there no matter what if i if i start the (73:07 - 73:11)
game i mean tutorial aside there might (73:09 - 73:12)
be a tutorial that's like hey you gotta (73:11 - 73:14)
get your sword before you leave (73:12 - 73:16)
but if i see that mountain that's all (73:14 - 73:17)
the way over there i can go to the (73:16 - 73:19)
mountain in fallout new vegas as soon as (73:17 - 73:22)
i get out of the thing if i want to go (73:19 - 73:24)
all the way to vegas which is (73:22 - 73:26)
on the other end of the map i can ignore (73:24 - 73:28)
every single task and i can get to vegas (73:26 - 73:29)
to start gambling (73:28 - 73:31)
i might i will probably die a million (73:29 - 73:32)
times because (73:31 - 73:34)
there's a bunch of monsters there but i (73:32 - 73:36)
can make it to vegas and i can ignore (73:34 - 73:38)
everything else in breath of the wild as (73:36 - 73:40)
soon as you get out of that tutorial you (73:38 - 73:42)
can go straight to ganondorf if you want (73:40 - 73:44)
you go straight to the desert if you (73:42 - 73:47)
want i consider that open world (73:44 - 73:48)
i don't consider (73:47 - 73:51)
monster hunter stories to open world (73:48 - 73:54)
because i have to do a bunch of tasks on (73:51 - 73:55)
the first island (73:54 - 73:56)
even though i can go anywhere on that (73:55 - 73:58)
island before i get to the second island (73:56 - 74:00)
before it unlocks the second island and (73:58 - 74:02)
i can't go to the third island without (74:00 - 74:03)
completing everything on the second (74:02 - 74:07)
island but what do you call that then (74:03 - 74:07)
not open world i mean open area open (74:07 - 74:12)
yeah an open area then the question is (74:10 - 74:15)
does it become open like is pokemon post (74:12 - 74:17)
game open world because at that point (74:15 - 74:19)
you can travel anywhere in the region (74:17 - 74:21)
yeah i mean i think so (74:19 - 74:24)
it's such a weird like (74:21 - 74:24)
like (74:24 - 74:26)
gate yes (74:24 - 74:28)
it's a weird gate just because things (74:26 - 74:31)
are locked behind gates (74:28 - 74:31)
doesn't sort of change what the gameplay (74:31 - 74:36)
is in those areas as they unlock like a (74:33 - 74:39)
story progression and rpg progression (74:36 - 74:42)
that's trying to tell tell a story (74:39 - 74:44)
tends to lock things behind so that you (74:42 - 74:46)
get the story that out of the way (74:44 - 74:47)
so it's so (74:46 - 74:49)
like (74:47 - 74:51)
again i don't i don't know (74:49 - 74:53)
if open world (74:51 - 74:55)
it's so important that i'd be able to go (74:53 - 74:57)
to any area i want whether or not i can (74:55 - 74:59)
complete anything in that area or i will (74:57 - 75:01)
get murdered in that area for (74:59 - 75:03)
merely stepping foot in there (75:01 - 75:06)
is that more important and that's what (75:03 - 75:08)
has to make it open world like people (75:06 - 75:10)
but like if you look at heart cultural (75:08 - 75:12)
silver (75:10 - 75:14)
gold and silver (75:12 - 75:15)
people liked that because there was an (75:14 - 75:17)
illusion of choice (75:15 - 75:20)
like oh i think an illusion right it is (75:17 - 75:22)
an illusion and oh but then you go get (75:20 - 75:24)
murdered because you're in an area (75:22 - 75:25)
you're not supposed to be it's also an (75:24 - 75:27)
illusion of choice because you're not (75:25 - 75:29)
having a good time (75:27 - 75:30)
there might be something well you know (75:29 - 75:32)
you know there's like five people out (75:30 - 75:33)
there that can do it and they're having (75:32 - 75:34)
a great time (75:33 - 75:36)
i i've done this (75:34 - 75:39)
we went from one city and ran across (75:36 - 75:41)
world of warcraft to get a guild charter (75:39 - 75:41)
signed (75:41 - 75:44)
literally dying and rezzing and dying (75:41 - 75:45)
and resigning dying to prove that we (75:44 - 75:46)
could do it was it fun (75:45 - 75:47)
no (75:46 - 75:50)
you could do it though absolutely awful (75:47 - 75:53)
absolutely was it did it ruin that game (75:50 - 75:56)
at the start sure did but boy i could (75:53 - 75:58)
tell one person we did this and they go (75:56 - 75:59)
wow (75:58 - 76:02)
why and i had no answer (75:59 - 76:04)
so i think that (76:02 - 76:08)
a lot of the issue here is that (76:04 - 76:10)
the kinds of games that were very (76:08 - 76:13)
clearly not open world are not (76:10 - 76:16)
made or played as much anymore so if you (76:13 - 76:18)
think of like doom (76:16 - 76:21)
doom is not open world you start at a (76:18 - 76:24)
spawn point you have to get to the exit (76:21 - 76:25)
you have (76:24 - 76:27)
no choices (76:25 - 76:29)
where where you go from there and the (76:27 - 76:32)
fact that there is so much more choice (76:29 - 76:35)
in how games go (76:32 - 76:37)
anymore and also in the post game right (76:35 - 76:40)
you can go anywhere so that basically (76:37 - 76:42)
does become open world not you can't (76:40 - 76:45)
like walk off the side of the map (76:42 - 76:47)
yeah it's like it's not infinite (76:45 - 76:50)
um that that that's (76:47 - 76:51)
it's it's become so water it's such a (76:50 - 76:54)
watered down concept (76:51 - 76:55)
where you know like (76:54 - 76:57)
was the original (76:55 - 76:57)
uh (76:57 - 76:58)
[Music] (76:57 - 76:59)
zelda (76:58 - 77:02)
open world because you know you had your (76:59 - 77:04)
rectangle you could go north south east (77:02 - 77:04)
west (77:04 - 77:06)
yeah you go wherever you want there (77:04 - 77:07)
would go wherever you wanted (77:06 - 77:09)
you could technically do the dungeons (77:07 - 77:11)
pretty much any order you wanted in the (77:09 - 77:12)
original zelda (77:11 - 77:15)
um although they would be harder (77:12 - 77:17)
they're they're required items like you (77:15 - 77:19)
had to do certain things you couldn't (77:17 - 77:22)
complete them yeah there's no (77:19 - 77:23)
this should not come out of shock that (77:22 - 77:26)
pokemon games are pretty linear (77:23 - 77:27)
you start (77:26 - 77:29)
yeah you go to eight gyms you get to the (77:27 - 77:31)
gyms you go to the elite four there's a (77:29 - 77:33)
little bit of post game there is you (77:31 - 77:38)
could theoretically skip erica's gym (77:33 - 77:40)
and as soon as and go to (77:38 - 77:42)
koga's gym before erica and go to (77:40 - 77:44)
sabrina and as soon as you get surf you (77:42 - 77:45)
could go to blaine and then you could (77:44 - 77:48)
come back and go to erica like you could (77:45 - 77:51)
do a different order and there is this (77:48 - 77:52)
want (77:51 - 77:55)
in the community the pokemon community (77:52 - 77:57)
maybe the hardcore community where (77:55 - 77:59)
this has been said for several years i (77:57 - 78:01)
wish that people want to do gyms in (77:59 - 78:04)
whatever order they want (78:01 - 78:08)
i i i don't know if that (78:04 - 78:10)
makes suddenly makes these games more (78:08 - 78:12)
fun or if suddenly that sells a million (78:10 - 78:14)
more copies because you could do uh (78:12 - 78:17)
olympia before you could do (78:14 - 78:18)
wolf rick well technically you're (78:17 - 78:19)
already doing (78:18 - 78:21)
you could do wolf rick before you could (78:19 - 78:24)
do olympia right like (78:21 - 78:24)
i have played bad open world games (78:25 - 78:29)
like i (78:28 - 78:31)
final fantasy 15 one of my favorite (78:29 - 78:34)
games was open world (78:31 - 78:36)
i after three hours of being like i can (78:34 - 78:38)
i walked over here and there's nothing (78:36 - 78:41)
to do over here why did i walk over here (78:38 - 78:43)
i have to walk back now there's no like (78:41 - 78:45)
i literally have to wear my leather (78:43 - 78:47)
clothes with my leather boy band we (78:45 - 78:49)
gotta walk all the way back because i (78:47 - 78:51)
walked out here i picked up an item that (78:49 - 78:53)
was .1 better than the item i already (78:51 - 78:55)
have and i would gotta hustle back it (78:53 - 78:58)
was a waste of time but you had the car (78:55 - 79:00)
no cause the car can't get off-road i (78:58 - 79:01)
had to walk through some cactuses and up (79:00 - 79:03)
some mountains it was it was bad it was (79:01 - 79:05)
a better car it was a bad experience you (79:03 - 79:06)
get the car that fly the end of final (79:05 - 79:08)
fantasy 15 you get you do get that (79:06 - 79:10)
flying car i know then it comes to final (79:08 - 79:12)
fantasy 14 because i have it (79:10 - 79:14)
um (79:12 - 79:14)
i don't mind (79:16 - 79:20)
linear games i've never really minded (79:18 - 79:22)
i've never really have cared that much (79:20 - 79:23)
that a pokemon is like from start to (79:22 - 79:26)
finish here you go (79:23 - 79:27)
and uh (79:26 - 79:30)
when sword and shield was coming out (79:27 - 79:31)
there was that mistranslation where (79:30 - 79:33)
there would be 16 gyms instead of eight (79:31 - 79:35)
gyms and the internet lost their minds (79:33 - 79:37)
or some people did (79:35 - 79:39)
but i i couldn't help but think (79:37 - 79:40)
man i want to be done with the pokemon (79:39 - 79:43)
after eight gyms like (79:40 - 79:45)
what why do you want to do another eight (79:43 - 79:48)
gems like like i'm sorry (79:45 - 79:50)
it was gold and silver and it was bad (79:48 - 79:52)
well no it's like i want to do eight (79:50 - 79:53)
gyms (79:52 - 79:56)
and then be able to get to (79:53 - 79:58)
to the (79:56 - 80:01)
why is the name of it (79:58 - 80:02)
the final four (80:01 - 80:05)
right the elite four i wanna like not (80:02 - 80:07)
that i have to do sixteen gyms to get to (80:05 - 80:08)
elite four but i get to pick which eight (80:07 - 80:10)
that i do out of the 16 that are (80:08 - 80:13)
available (80:10 - 80:16)
that's what people want (80:13 - 80:16)
yeah maybe but a gym is still a gym (80:16 - 80:21)
and it's very similar to what like isle (80:19 - 80:24)
of armor was right you pick either water (80:21 - 80:26)
or dark and (80:24 - 80:28)
then the other one is closed off to you (80:26 - 80:31)
yeah and i guess it adds replayability i (80:28 - 80:34)
i feel like there's just this (80:31 - 80:34)
like just because a book is longer (80:35 - 80:38)
doesn't mean the book is suddenly better (80:37 - 80:40)
just because a tv show keeps going for (80:38 - 80:42)
seasons doesn't mean that it keeps (80:40 - 80:43)
getting better (80:42 - 80:45)
the thing for open world is people want (80:43 - 80:46)
it to be (80:45 - 80:48)
their story (80:46 - 80:50)
right they don't want to be playing a (80:48 - 80:52)
story written by somebody else they want (80:50 - 80:54)
to believe that this is their story that (80:52 - 80:56)
they are experiencing as they play the (80:54 - 80:58)
game and the less (80:56 - 81:00)
open it is for decisions for you to make (80:58 - 81:05)
than the less of your story that it is (81:00 - 81:05)
then don't play rpgs that somebody else (81:06 - 81:11)
had to program go into tabletop rpgs you (81:08 - 81:12)
could have that experience with your (81:11 - 81:15)
friends at the table the the amount of (81:12 - 81:17)
customization for your character in (81:15 - 81:20)
legends the fact that you can (81:17 - 81:22)
like i know people when they were first (81:20 - 81:24)
got to experience the wild area they (81:22 - 81:26)
were like i'm going to spend 100 hours (81:24 - 81:28)
in the wild area because this is all i (81:26 - 81:29)
ever want to do in pokemon is to run (81:28 - 81:31)
around and catch pokemon and they were (81:29 - 81:32)
perfectly happy (81:31 - 81:35)
yeah yeah and to them that's open world (81:32 - 81:36)
enough (81:35 - 81:38)
yeah i think i think the (81:36 - 81:40)
i have spent hundreds of hours in the (81:38 - 81:42)
isle of armor and the crown tundra (81:40 - 81:45)
um (81:42 - 81:45)
and there are there are some things to (81:45 - 81:49)
do and i think that those games were (81:47 - 81:51)
really good (81:49 - 81:53)
attempts (81:51 - 81:56)
that game freak did like i i do think (81:53 - 81:57)
the crown tundra and the isle of arm i (81:56 - 81:59)
think the isle of armor is better but i (81:57 - 82:02)
think they they it it blows away the (81:59 - 82:04)
original wild area (82:02 - 82:06)
there were more things to do (82:04 - 82:08)
um they were there were things to come (82:06 - 82:10)
back to every day to explore or to pick (82:08 - 82:12)
up items i think they were great (82:10 - 82:14)
expansions (82:12 - 82:15)
and (82:14 - 82:19)
i would assume that legends would be uh (82:15 - 82:21)
more of that (82:19 - 82:25)
where the areas are as big as the crown (82:21 - 82:27)
tundra or the isle of armor but there (82:25 - 82:29)
are four of the areas or five of the (82:27 - 82:30)
areas and you have to you know there (82:29 - 82:32)
might be a loading screen in between or (82:30 - 82:34)
a flying screen in between (82:32 - 82:35)
um (82:34 - 82:36)
and i think that's cool i think that's (82:35 - 82:40)
fine i think that like if if your choice (82:36 - 82:41)
is (82:40 - 82:44)
open world and there's nothing to do in (82:41 - 82:46)
this open world or we're gonna make it (82:44 - 82:49)
more linear but it's going to feel like (82:46 - 82:50)
you're always doing something because (82:49 - 82:52)
we're pushing your forward i'm going to (82:50 - 82:54)
take the linear experience because i (82:52 - 82:56)
don't want a giant big empty open world (82:54 - 82:58)
that there's nothing to do (82:56 - 83:00)
um and if there is something to do the (82:58 - 83:01)
first time (83:00 - 83:03)
is there something to do when i come (83:01 - 83:05)
back to it and i think that's where the (83:03 - 83:08)
crown tundra failed once you did the (83:05 - 83:10)
birds once you caught the legends (83:08 - 83:13)
um once you caught the regis (83:10 - 83:15)
the crown tundra wasn't as fun to (83:13 - 83:16)
explore (83:15 - 83:19)
compared to the isle of armor (83:16 - 83:20)
isla armor was mostly to like pick up (83:19 - 83:23)
like competitive stuff and yeah it was (83:20 - 83:24)
it was just a little bit better in like (83:23 - 83:27)
dailies um and then the only thing you (83:24 - 83:28)
end up doing crown tundra sit in that (83:27 - 83:29)
cave for dynamics adventures which is (83:28 - 83:31)
great dynamics adventures is cool but (83:29 - 83:34)
like crown tundra was just (83:31 - 83:36)
like it it had more things to do in the (83:34 - 83:39)
world but once you did those things (83:36 - 83:40)
there was nothing else to do (83:39 - 83:41)
and so when i'm looking at these (83:40 - 83:43)
screenshots of arceus and i'm like (83:41 - 83:45)
we're flying over on a bravery and (83:43 - 83:48)
there's three badoos in a rock (83:45 - 83:49)
i'm worried (83:48 - 83:51)
like (83:49 - 83:54)
like i get that we're we're five months (83:51 - 83:56)
away from the game (83:54 - 83:58)
they're still gotta add the polish (83:56 - 84:00)
but also are they gonna add like four (83:58 - 84:02)
more pokemon next to those badoos uh is (84:00 - 84:03)
it only gonna be a run rock what else we (84:02 - 84:05)
doing here because once i catch like i (84:03 - 84:05)
mean (84:05 - 84:07)
we don't know what (84:05 - 84:09)
they are real good at taking (84:07 - 84:11)
highly curated shots so they don't give (84:09 - 84:13)
away secrets (84:11 - 84:14)
so they don't give away what other (84:13 - 84:17)
pokemon might be in the area like they (84:14 - 84:18)
are (84:17 - 84:22)
notorious for taking bad shots to keep (84:18 - 84:24)
secrets so i (84:22 - 84:27)
i can't make that call yet because i (84:24 - 84:28)
don't know (84:27 - 84:29)
like (84:28 - 84:31)
what frame they decided to steal this (84:29 - 84:32)
from what was like okay perfect they (84:31 - 84:34)
know beat us in the game and they see (84:32 - 84:38)
nothing else take that moment (84:34 - 84:38)
i am excited for these games i'm very (84:41 - 84:46)
excited for these games yes but i think (84:44 - 84:48)
the the concern that i bring to this (84:46 - 84:50)
show every week is (84:48 - 84:52)
they (84:50 - 84:54)
it's very hard to mess up diamond and (84:52 - 84:55)
pearl (84:54 - 84:57)
like (84:55 - 84:59)
they're remaking oh no they've already (84:57 - 85:01)
messed up diamond and pearl yeah (84:59 - 85:05)
they put the chibis no (85:01 - 85:05)
you don't (85:05 - 85:09)
there's no online puffin making (85:06 - 85:11)
yeah i have to make my coffins on my own (85:09 - 85:14)
that is unacceptable i'm out i'm done (85:11 - 85:16)
not lost interest like i feel i feel (85:14 - 85:18)
like a core game you go to eight gyms (85:16 - 85:20)
you battle the elite four you catch some (85:18 - 85:22)
pokemon (85:20 - 85:24)
like i feel like that that formula is is (85:22 - 85:26)
pretty hard to mess up (85:24 - 85:27)
and there might be somebody that was (85:26 - 85:28)
like well they messed up x and y or they (85:27 - 85:30)
messed up black and white like yeah yeah (85:28 - 85:32)
maybe (85:30 - 85:34)
that's maybe pokemon preference or world (85:32 - 85:36)
preference but like the core formula (85:34 - 85:38)
catch some pokemon battle some gym (85:36 - 85:39)
leaders (85:38 - 85:41)
uh complaining the game is too easy (85:39 - 85:42)
because you've already played 40 (85:41 - 85:44)
versions of these and then c credits (85:42 - 85:47)
like that formula works (85:44 - 85:49)
there's no reason they stray from it (85:47 - 85:51)
they're straying from it here (85:49 - 85:53)
although this isn't like a gen 9 or a (85:51 - 85:56)
gen 10 this is whatever let's go pikachu (85:53 - 85:58)
let's go evie was or whatever weird (85:56 - 85:59)
experiment they want to do i'm good with (85:58 - 86:00)
that (85:59 - 86:02)
props to developers for wanting to try (86:00 - 86:05)
something new big risk (86:02 - 86:09)
i wanted to succeed (86:05 - 86:09)
right (86:09 - 86:12)
i already complained about everything (86:11 - 86:14)
screenshots (86:12 - 86:15)
all right (86:14 - 86:18)
i just i'm just saying like i i (86:15 - 86:21)
i do want it to do well (86:18 - 86:23)
the open world stuff was never make or (86:21 - 86:24)
break for me (86:23 - 86:25)
i am (86:24 - 86:27)
in an unfortunate position sometimes to (86:25 - 86:29)
be a twitch streamer and i am waiting (86:27 - 86:30)
for all those people to come in and (86:29 - 86:32)
complain that the reason this game sucks (86:30 - 86:35)
because it wasn't open world and because (86:32 - 86:37)
they had that expectation your life (86:35 - 86:39)
choice that is my life choice i'll have (86:37 - 86:42)
a person in and say come complain to me (86:39 - 86:44)
but please sub to me first but my but my (86:42 - 86:46)
argument back to them would be like do (86:44 - 86:47)
you re do you really think you would (86:46 - 86:49)
have more enjoyment if you could go (86:47 - 86:51)
battle uh blissey before you battle (86:49 - 86:53)
cleaver is that is that really what was (86:51 - 86:55)
going to make your 60 dollars feel super (86:53 - 86:57)
worth it i don't know like again do you (86:55 - 86:59)
think that battling wolf rick before (86:57 - 87:01)
olympia and x and y do you were like wow (86:59 - 87:03)
wow this game got significantly better (87:01 - 87:04)
because i saw avalon before i saw i (87:03 - 87:06)
don't even know what olympia uses miss (87:04 - 87:08)
maggie is i don't know what stick (87:06 - 87:11)
oh meow stick (87:08 - 87:11)

some fan i am all right well let's take (87:15 - 87:19)
a break then we'll do diamond pearl (87:17 - 87:21)

we'll do our question of the week (87:21 - 87:24)
pokemon of the week (87:23 - 87:27)
and we'll be right back (87:24 - 87:44)

pearl versions bring trainers back to (88:43 - 88:47)
sinnoh where they meet professor rowan (88:45 - 88:49)
battle team rocket explorer grand (88:47 - 88:51)
underground (88:49 - 88:51)
team (88:52 - 88:57)
team galactic sorry yeah uh i did (88:53 - 88:59)
garbage okay (88:57 - 89:00)
i didn't learn this until my youtube (88:59 - 89:01)
comments (89:00 - 89:04)
i thought it was pokey tech (89:01 - 89:07)
like technology pokedex oh poke catch i (89:04 - 89:08)
didn't realize that (89:07 - 89:13)
the tch was like the end of watch yeah (89:08 - 89:16)
watch it's a watch i thought it was i (89:13 - 89:18)
thought it was tech like did you not (89:16 - 89:20)
watch the anime (89:18 - 89:24)
no that was the worst version oh what (89:20 - 89:26)
diamond pro anime was i couldn't get (89:24 - 89:29)
past the theme song with people up (89:26 - 89:32)
pip-plop no piplup is the best hip-hop's (89:29 - 89:34)
the best part of the diamond and pearl (89:32 - 89:36)
anime i will give you that and the (89:34 - 89:38)
season one rap is (89:36 - 89:40)
awful (89:38 - 89:41)
look (89:40 - 89:44)
season 2 20 21 you hit 30 seconds (89:41 - 89:47)
forward on the yeah you go skip intro (89:44 - 89:49)
you have to you don't have nothing to (89:47 - 89:51)
hear the diamond pearl anime also has (89:49 - 89:54)
the worst animation it is the like the (89:51 - 89:56)
clunkiest yeah or just the (89:54 - 90:00)
khan wasser of all things visual arts i (89:56 - 90:02)
will say this (90:00 - 90:05)
the art isn't (90:02 - 90:05)
worse (90:05 - 90:10)
what makes it bad is they recycle (90:07 - 90:13)
entire scenes and entire frames over and (90:10 - 90:15)
over and over (90:13 - 90:17)
actually uh traditional japanese (90:15 - 90:19)
animation because i'm not kidding (90:17 - 90:21)
because when they first started doing (90:19 - 90:23)
animation in japan they had very limited (90:21 - 90:25)
supplies so they developed a technique (90:23 - 90:27)
where they would use still frames and (90:25 - 90:30)
move the camera or they would reuse the (90:27 - 90:32)
the the backgrounds and everything like (90:30 - 90:33)
that yeah (90:32 - 90:36)
really obvious in a lot of the enemy (90:33 - 90:39)
episodes well there was what it was like (90:36 - 90:40)
um (90:39 - 90:43)
indigo league orange islands and then (90:40 - 90:45)
johto (90:43 - 90:47)
journeys or whatever journeys (90:45 - 90:49)
yeah all of that was like the same (90:47 - 90:51)
company yeah and then the pokemon (90:49 - 90:53)
company was like we want to do this (90:51 - 90:56)
cheaper and then they and then it got it (90:53 - 90:59)
did cheaper they did (90:56 - 91:01)
cheaper was very apparent when you see (90:59 - 91:04)
some of those seasons (91:01 - 91:06)
all right so okay so is it it's so it's (91:04 - 91:09)
supposed to be pokey watch poke poke (91:06 - 91:13)
poke how do you say it catch pokemon (91:09 - 91:16)
like etch a sketch yeah it's like (91:13 - 91:17)
the poke (91:16 - 91:20)
is a handy gadget for players to receive (91:17 - 91:22)
on their in-game journey that's loaded (91:20 - 91:24)
up with various apps this all-purpose (91:22 - 91:26)
tool has apps for all sorts of (91:24 - 91:28)
situations like the dowsing machine (91:26 - 91:30)
which can be used to locate hidden items (91:28 - 91:33)
uh the poke will also allow players to (91:30 - 91:35)
call wild pokemon to help them out to (91:33 - 91:38)
use hidden moves like cut chop to chop (91:35 - 91:40)
down trees and rock climb to scale (91:38 - 91:43)
cliffs now this (91:40 - 91:43)
i was so excited when the when the (91:43 - 91:48)
trailer happened and they didn't tweet (91:46 - 91:49)
out anything and the press release (91:48 - 91:51)
wasn't up and people were losing their (91:49 - 91:54)
minds about hm's being best that was a (91:51 - 91:57)
glorious can we five minutes can we psa (91:54 - 91:59)
for a minute because there's actually a (91:57 - 92:00)
lot of people who miss this (91:59 - 92:01)
yeah (92:00 - 92:05)
one yes hms are back (92:01 - 92:08)
but yes two you do not have to have them (92:05 - 92:11)
on a pokemon in your party you use the (92:08 - 92:13)
poke etch to call the agent watch the (92:11 - 92:15)
video you use the poke (92:13 - 92:17)
to call the hm (92:15 - 92:19)
one of the local pokemon runs over and (92:17 - 92:21)
does it for you (92:19 - 92:22)
and this is like (92:21 - 92:25)
fine the reason that hms were ever a (92:22 - 92:28)
thing was to gate content to prevent you (92:25 - 92:29)
from going somewhere you're not supposed (92:28 - 92:32)
to get in and open that game yeah um (92:29 - 92:35)
and in in let's go pikachu let's go (92:32 - 92:37)
eevee they were like well we have to (92:35 - 92:39)
we have to prevent players from getting (92:37 - 92:40)
over here because they're not ready to (92:39 - 92:42)
be over here and they did the thing (92:40 - 92:45)
where like pikachu can cut pikachu can (92:42 - 92:47)
surf pikachu can fly pikachu can i don't (92:45 - 92:48)
know what the other one was (92:47 - 92:49)
swim (92:48 - 92:51)
flash (92:49 - 92:54)
and i thought they handled that great (92:51 - 92:55)
like (92:54 - 92:56)
the (92:55 - 92:58)
if you have not played diamond and pearl (92:56 - 93:00)
there's this giant mountain called mount (92:58 - 93:02)
cornet (93:00 - 93:04)
and in order to get to the elite four (93:02 - 93:06)
and to the end of the game you have to (93:04 - 93:08)
well you go through mount cornett (93:06 - 93:10)
multiple times (93:08 - 93:12)
uh there's you have to (93:10 - 93:13)
mount cornets in the middle of the map (93:12 - 93:15)
so you have to cross through it (93:13 - 93:17)
and you have to do it a lot a lot and (93:15 - 93:20)
it's very annoying uh spoiler there's a (93:17 - 93:21)
bunch of geodudes and zubats in that (93:20 - 93:23)
cave i want to just remind everyone that (93:21 - 93:25)
diamond pro were the fourth generation (93:23 - 93:27)
games and (93:25 - 93:30)
generation one zubat geodude generation (93:27 - 93:33)
two zubat geodude generation three zubat (93:30 - 93:34)
geodude sometimes you get a little (93:33 - 93:36)
makahita in there you know mix it up a (93:34 - 93:39)
little bit but do that generation four (93:36 - 93:43)
we're still doing zuma jio dude (93:39 - 93:45)
wanna put that on generation five had a (93:43 - 93:47)
zubat cave (93:45 - 93:49)
or was that six which one had actual (93:47 - 93:51)
zubat cave i think that was black too (93:49 - 93:52)
white too (93:51 - 93:55)
no i think that's actually why yeah (93:52 - 93:56)
excellent like look (93:55 - 93:59)
caves are bad (93:56 - 94:01)
they're just full of zubats no charge (93:59 - 94:03)
stone cave and twist mountain are (94:01 - 94:04)
fantastic (94:03 - 94:06)
yeah they're pretty good (94:04 - 94:08)
and so (94:06 - 94:10)
the problem the problem the problem the (94:08 - 94:13)
issue the problem with diamond and pearl (94:10 - 94:14)
was (94:13 - 94:16)
through these four generations they kept (94:14 - 94:18)
adding more hms (94:16 - 94:22)
this one added rock climb and defog de (94:18 - 94:23)
fog (94:22 - 94:25)
and i think that was it so we're up like (94:23 - 94:27)
a french nobleman (94:25 - 94:29)
with the count to fog (94:27 - 94:32)
so in order to get to the elite four you (94:29 - 94:35)
needed strength you needed surf you (94:32 - 94:38)
needed waterfall yep you needed flash (94:35 - 94:42)
yep up to four you needed rock climb yep (94:38 - 94:44)
you needed cut (94:42 - 94:48)
yep uh you needed rock (94:44 - 94:51)
smash i believe (94:48 - 94:51)
which is not technically an hm but you (94:51 - 94:56)
needed it (94:53 - 94:56)
i don't remember (94:57 - 95:01)
i i thought that was optional i think it (94:59 - 95:02)
was optional but there was like there (95:01 - 95:05)
was stuff behind it yeah yeah (95:02 - 95:08)
uh you needed whirlpool (95:05 - 95:08)
no (95:08 - 95:10)
[Music] (95:08 - 95:12)
you needed to fog (95:10 - 95:13)
yeah i don't think you needed to fog (95:12 - 95:15)
either you didn't well you didn't you (95:13 - 95:16)
you had something (95:15 - 95:19)
you had everything you ever need you (95:16 - 95:20)
never need flash and you never need to (95:19 - 95:23)
fog no no no there's a point where you (95:20 - 95:25)
have you're trying to go a certain area (95:23 - 95:27)
you have to defog it (95:25 - 95:29)
what like you don't have to you can you (95:27 - 95:31)
can walk through it (95:29 - 95:33)
it's the same thing with flash it's the (95:31 - 95:35)
same thing like you don't need flash or (95:33 - 95:38)
defog but it makes it easier yeah (95:35 - 95:43)
so anyways the point is that you need (95:38 - 95:46)
realistically at least (95:43 - 95:48)
six six (95:46 - 95:52)
bare minimum six so if you (95:48 - 95:54)
and and a lot like (95:52 - 95:56)
rock climb and strength they're both (95:54 - 95:58)
normal tight moves (95:56 - 95:59)
i mean (95:58 - 96:01)
rock climb can flinch so you would want (95:59 - 96:02)
it like on a faster pokemon to flinch (96:01 - 96:03)
but (96:02 - 96:05)
strength doesn't i mean strikes a fine (96:03 - 96:08)
move it's not awful but (96:05 - 96:09)
the cuts normal (96:08 - 96:12)
so some players would take like a b (96:09 - 96:14)
barrel and they would do four (96:12 - 96:16)
on that okay so now you don't have a (96:14 - 96:19)
party member because b barrel is taking (96:16 - 96:21)
up the party slot and you still need (96:19 - 96:22)
three more so where are you gonna put (96:21 - 96:24)
that (96:22 - 96:27)
a little here a little bit (96:24 - 96:27)
it was it's such a it's just such an (96:27 - 96:32)
awful experience (96:30 - 96:34)
to go through and have that many like (96:32 - 96:37)
even even going through gold and silver (96:34 - 96:38)
i was like (96:37 - 96:39)
i have one water pokemon on my team i (96:38 - 96:41)
don't want to teach it whirlpool (96:39 - 96:43)
waterfall and surf (96:41 - 96:45)
like but i don't want more than one (96:43 - 96:47)
water pokemon like what am i (96:45 - 96:49)
what but you're bad thinking about (96:47 - 96:51)
something that's not an issue any longer (96:49 - 96:53)
it's not i know (96:51 - 96:55)
but the but this was the biggest issue (96:53 - 96:57)
in diamond pro one (96:55 - 96:59)
was yes no longer and they fixed it and (96:57 - 97:02)
i think they fixed it in a very nice way (96:59 - 97:06)
yes very similar to alola (97:02 - 97:07)
yeah (97:06 - 97:08)
yeah i i'm very happy with this was kind (97:07 - 97:10)
of like the make or break for me was (97:08 - 97:13)
this hm stuff and and they did it (97:10 - 97:14)
i want to remind people they didn't do (97:13 - 97:16)
this for omega ruby alpha sapphire and (97:14 - 97:17)
it was annoying (97:16 - 97:20)
was it not greg it was annoying it was (97:17 - 97:23)
fun you got to fly around in a lot of us (97:20 - 97:26)
that was cool that was amazing that was (97:23 - 97:28)
like six gyms you play though you got a (97:26 - 97:30)
million people who helped you teleport (97:28 - 97:32)
throughout this throughout the world it (97:30 - 97:35)
was amazing (97:32 - 97:38)
you are just a hater 1 000 (97:35 - 97:41)
you just hate things because you are an (97:38 - 97:44)
unhappy individual who cannot find joy (97:41 - 97:46)
in your own life so you take it out on (97:44 - 97:49)
innocent really great games omega ruby (97:46 - 97:51)
alpha sapphire had to say wait for let's (97:49 - 97:55)
go pikachu and dive into pearl to swim (97:51 - 97:55)
just because you didn't like it because (97:56 - 98:00)
of your weird criteria does that mean (97:57 - 98:03)
it's the best not hmm are (98:00 - 98:04)
bad (98:03 - 98:06)
yeah they should have ended after they (98:04 - 98:09)
should have ended with gen 3. (98:06 - 98:09)
and they only double down yeah i mean (98:09 - 98:15)
hms are bad but they lasted and for a (98:13 - 98:18)
very very long time way too long way too (98:15 - 98:20)
long um (98:18 - 98:23)
how many uh poke poke poke (98:20 - 98:25)
how many poke things are there like 52 (98:23 - 98:27)
48 something like that there are (98:25 - 98:28)
apps (98:27 - 98:32)
yeah there's a lot there's like 30 (98:28 - 98:34)
no there has to be more than 40 because (98:32 - 98:36)
you can unlock so some are optional you (98:34 - 98:37)
had to like talk to people (98:36 - 98:38)
but i don't think there's i don't think (98:37 - 98:41)
there's more than 30. (98:38 - 98:41)
uh have fun with pokemon in immediatey (98:43 - 98:46)
square (98:46 - 98:50)
amenity square is a hearth home city a (98:46 - 98:51)
relaxing place where trainers can spend (98:50 - 98:52)
time with their pokemon they'll be able (98:51 - 98:55)
to walk up with six pokemon at a time so (98:52 - 98:57)
long as among the list of pokemon are (98:55 - 98:59)
permitted in the park (98:57 - 99:01)
while in humidity square players can (98:59 - 99:03)
also adjust the camera angle and zoom (99:01 - 99:06)
level to take commemorative photos and (99:03 - 99:08)
videos of their pokemon photos can be (99:06 - 99:09)
taken by using the nintendo switch (99:08 - 99:12)
capture button and look this is not a (99:09 - 99:14)
feature you're just using the what's (99:12 - 99:16)
built into the switch to be like we have (99:14 - 99:17)
photo mode (99:16 - 99:19)
amity (99:17 - 99:21)
it's amity park (99:19 - 99:22)
amity park (99:21 - 99:27)
is the most controversial mm-hmm (99:22 - 99:30)
who are you yeah (99:27 - 99:33)
to tell me (99:30 - 99:33)
which pokemon (99:33 - 99:41)
are cute enough to be in your park (99:35 - 99:45)
i pay the same taxes as you (99:41 - 99:47)
there i agree thank you (99:45 - 99:50)
civil services are for all pokemon (99:47 - 99:54)
available apps in the poke okay (99:50 - 99:56)
50. (99:54 - 99:56)
seven out of 10 game not enough (99:57 - 100:04)
two too few apps yeah the gatekeeping of (100:00 - 100:05)
what's cute (100:04 - 100:09)
that was truly the worst part of (100:05 - 100:11)
diamond pearl and platinum (100:09 - 100:14)
uh it looks like that this was (100:11 - 100:15)
not the same as sword and shield but you (100:14 - 100:17)
know you gather six pokemon around you (100:15 - 100:19)
stir some pot you throw some (100:17 - 100:21)
whatever in the pot and you have a curry (100:19 - 100:23)
or whatever i used to be able to do with (100:21 - 100:25)
my friends yep but now i can't do it (100:23 - 100:26)
with my friends anymore some faithful (100:25 - 100:29)
reproduction this has now worked pointed (100:26 - 100:31)
out the real flaws (100:29 - 100:33)
make i like how i was mad about arceus (100:31 - 100:37)
and you two are mad about (100:33 - 100:37)
pokemon can snag and raise pokemon (100:38 - 100:43)
conditions such as coolness or cuteness (100:40 - 100:45)
by raising their conditions uh players (100:43 - 100:47)
can get a higher score during the visual (100:45 - 100:50)
evaluation of the super contest shows in (100:47 - 100:52)
diamond and pearl it was only possible (100:50 - 100:53)
to make poffins at the poffin house but (100:52 - 100:55)
now players can make them in (100:53 - 100:58)
a midi amenity square as well dammit (100:55 - 101:01)
amity square (100:58 - 101:01)
the hm thing was big (101:03 - 101:07)
yep yes (101:06 - 101:10)
and i (101:07 - 101:12)
i will never forget atrocious jake and (101:10 - 101:14)
his (101:12 - 101:16)
his chat (101:14 - 101:18)
for me doing a service by mentioning (101:16 - 101:21)
while they were all upset about hm's the (101:18 - 101:23)
reality and they all yelled at me for (101:21 - 101:25)
spoilers and i said it's not a spoiler (101:23 - 101:27)
when they put it the press release yeah (101:25 - 101:30)
twitter and yet they came from my throat (101:27 - 101:33)
and i said fine goodbye and i've written (101:30 - 101:35)
them off forever (101:33 - 101:37)
now you're thinking that will anderson (101:35 - 101:41)
tacked yeah rude (101:37 - 101:41)
i mean people avoid news for days until (101:42 - 101:46)
this show comes up because they don't (101:45 - 101:49)
want to be spoiled but (101:46 - 101:51)
just to point out the ridiculous you (101:49 - 101:53)
know that there's hms in the game (101:51 - 101:56)
because you watched the video and the (101:53 - 102:00)
video clearly shows them calling the hms (101:56 - 102:02)
from the poke etch (102:00 - 102:03)
right (102:02 - 102:06)
where's the spoiler the spoiler was they (102:03 - 102:07)
thought it you had to still have it in (102:06 - 102:09)
your box or in your party and it was (102:07 - 102:12)
just a faster way so you clarified you (102:09 - 102:15)
didn't spoil it correct correct it was a (102:12 - 102:18)
terrible morning i uh expects pokemon (102:15 - 102:20)
fans are literally the worst human (102:18 - 102:21)
beings ever yes that's why we do this (102:20 - 102:22)
podcast (102:21 - 102:24)
yes did you not hear the part about (102:22 - 102:26)
arceus legends and people thinking it (102:24 - 102:27)
was open world (102:26 - 102:29)
am not going back to that (102:27 - 102:31)
we are past that did you remember the (102:29 - 102:32)
oreo part of this podcast did you (102:31 - 102:34)
remember the 40 (102:32 - 102:37)
skin a part of this podcast (102:34 - 102:39)
if anything (102:37 - 102:41)
we have come full circle in what the (102:39 - 102:43)
show has become (102:41 - 102:46)
what i will say as in the designer in me (102:43 - 102:49)
i hate that the poke is jammed in the (102:46 - 102:52)
corner exactly yeah (102:49 - 102:54)
like it like usually when things pop out (102:52 - 102:56)
it has like i don't know how to say it (102:54 - 102:57)
to non-design people there's like a (102:56 - 103:00)
margin like it kind of like floats and (102:57 - 103:02)
it like slides over it just being jammed (103:00 - 103:04)
in the corner seems very like not done (103:02 - 103:07)
so i hope it's actually not done and it (103:04 - 103:09)
looks better when it pops out i get that (103:07 - 103:10)
there's not two screens and it has to (103:09 - 103:11)
pop over (103:10 - 103:13)
whatever (103:11 - 103:15)
it's only when you call it up right like (103:13 - 103:17)
it's not they're all no it's not like (103:15 - 103:18)
permanently yeah yeah it's not like (103:17 - 103:20)
permanently there um (103:18 - 103:23)
the the game freak and whatever they (103:20 - 103:25)
they're usually really good at like like (103:23 - 103:26)
the menus in sword and shield are great (103:25 - 103:28)
like the menus in legends look awesome (103:26 - 103:29)
like (103:28 - 103:32)
uh this poke catch in the corner just (103:29 - 103:34)
looks really out of place so i hope (103:32 - 103:36)
that's not final (103:34 - 103:38)
um but maybe you can move it around (103:36 - 103:40)
through options oh yeah maybe you can (103:38 - 103:42)
like put it where you want that'd be (103:40 - 103:44)
cool like right in the middle so it (103:42 - 103:47)
blocks everything that i'm looking at (103:44 - 103:49)
uh we still don't know about the the (103:47 - 103:50)
gb (103:49 - 103:54)
global battle global trading g what gts (103:50 - 103:55)
this (103:54 - 103:57)
is the global trading station yeah we (103:55 - 103:59)
still don't know what the (103:57 - 104:01)
gts is doing because it's a pokemon home (103:59 - 104:03)
so they've said (104:01 - 104:06)
that it all happened in the union room (104:03 - 104:10)
yeah so what is that building (104:06 - 104:13)
offices now this is what technology does (104:10 - 104:15)
maybe that building is dedicated to (104:13 - 104:17)
making the cell phones and then hoopa's (104:15 - 104:18)
at the top (104:17 - 104:21)
of the floor on the (104:18 - 104:21)
it won't work because they don't have (104:23 - 104:27)
electricity or cell towers or satellites (104:24 - 104:30)
or anything else because it's (104:27 - 104:32)
16 something (104:30 - 104:35)
just throw the copper wire through them (104:32 - 104:38)
they'll figure it out (104:35 - 104:38)
put in our circuitry they'll be good (104:38 - 104:41)
uh yeah both of these trailers were like (104:42 - 104:45)
[Music] (104:44 - 104:47)
they were just like here are some things (104:45 - 104:50)
to do in the game (104:47 - 104:54)
enjoy i mean i think for (104:50 - 104:54)
i think both did what they needed to do (104:54 - 104:59)
like answered the question about hm's (104:57 - 105:01)
did some more things about the world (104:59 - 105:03)
which you know i mean they did answer (105:01 - 105:05)
the question about the square we we did (105:03 - 105:06)
ask that like what is the square doing (105:05 - 105:07)
if (105:06 - 105:09)
so like they (105:07 - 105:11)
i feel like they are clarifying that the (105:09 - 105:13)
faithful (105:11 - 105:14)
is what we said about was just like a (105:13 - 105:16)
descriptor and not like (105:14 - 105:19)
uh a step-by-step remake of diamond and (105:16 - 105:22)
pearl like i think they needed to show (105:19 - 105:24)
like yes we have changed things ahead of (105:22 - 105:25)
the game (105:24 - 105:27)
and be prepared that atms are different (105:25 - 105:29)
and amity square is different and (105:27 - 105:32)
it's not the exact same game that you (105:29 - 105:32)
played (105:32 - 105:34)
in the past (105:32 - 105:35)
i think that was important for them to (105:34 - 105:38)
show and i think (105:35 - 105:40)
for the arcade trader it was hey you (105:38 - 105:43)
have customizations uh and there are (105:40 - 105:45)
more pokemon that we haven't told you (105:43 - 105:48)
about and i think both were (105:45 - 105:50)
excellent at creating a level of (105:48 - 105:53)
excitement for upcoming products they (105:50 - 105:56)
did exactly what they needed to do (105:53 - 106:00)
did we ever talk about how (105:56 - 106:02)
i don't know if the english i don't know (106:00 - 106:04)
if there's any english press that (106:02 - 106:05)
officially verified this but i wanted to (106:04 - 106:07)
say it was like (106:05 - 106:10)
spanish or something that said that (106:07 - 106:12)
it's only the up to gen 4 pokemon for (106:10 - 106:15)
diamond and pearl (106:12 - 106:15)
look there's nothing i have i saw that (106:16 - 106:19)
somewhere yeah i saw that somewhere too (106:18 - 106:21)
but i don't remember the source so i (106:19 - 106:23)
don't want to fully say but it was like (106:21 - 106:24)
pretty much (106:23 - 106:26)
yeah this is only (106:24 - 106:28)
no gen 5 no gen 6 no gen 7 no gen 8 this (106:26 - 106:32)
is the faithful part of the (106:28 - 106:36)
which is but we can we got time to (106:32 - 106:36)
worry about that later (106:36 - 106:40)
i mean that's the way the let's go games (106:38 - 106:40)
were (106:40 - 106:42)
that's true that's true i mean those (106:40 - 106:44)
were the expectations they set with (106:42 - 106:46)
let's go and (106:44 - 106:47)
sword and shield and there are still (106:46 - 106:49)
people out there being like they're (106:47 - 106:50)
going to add the rest of the pokemon to (106:49 - 106:52)
sword and shield (106:50 - 106:53)
i don't (106:52 - 106:54)
i think that should be sailed (106:53 - 106:56)
[Laughter] (106:54 - 106:58)
and it's available on steam and you can (106:56 - 107:01)
create your own mods for it correct (106:58 - 107:03)
yeah i was talking about some people (107:01 - 107:07)
about this uh yesterday though of like (107:03 - 107:07)
you know we were talking about league of (107:07 - 107:12)
legends and how there's well like 200 (107:09 - 107:14)
champions in league of legends (107:12 - 107:17)
and as like somebody who (107:14 - 107:20)
was like maybe i should get into league (107:17 - 107:21)
where where do you like where did you (107:20 - 107:24)
start like what legend do you pick yeah (107:21 - 107:27)
or buy or unlock or like how do you get (107:24 - 107:30)
into that and unfortunately because you (107:27 - 107:32)
said those words now on this program you (107:30 - 107:35)
will literally get 1 000 tweets (107:32 - 107:37)
no i don't know (107:35 - 107:38)
i want to actually get to the league (107:37 - 107:41)
thinking you actually cared (107:38 - 107:42)
but with something like competitive (107:41 - 107:44)
pokemon if you have 800 pokemon versus (107:42 - 107:46)
400 pokemon i know some people are like (107:44 - 107:48)
well those other 400 pokemon really (107:46 - 107:49)
weren't meta but there's still a (107:48 - 107:52)
expectation of like (107:49 - 107:54)
there's a lot here where do i start (107:52 - 107:56)
where do i go (107:54 - 107:57)
and i don't think it's fair to be like (107:56 - 108:00)
okay well watch these 17 youtube videos (107:57 - 108:03)
and then go to this website and like (108:00 - 108:04)
then come back (108:03 - 108:06)
and then you know watch these three (108:04 - 108:08)
world championship things they're five (108:06 - 108:10)
hours long each but then you'll really (108:08 - 108:12)
like i just don't think that's fair to (108:10 - 108:14)
tell a player like (108:12 - 108:16)
not ever like there are some players (108:14 - 108:17)
that really want to get into something (108:16 - 108:19)
competitive whether it's league or apex (108:17 - 108:22)
or call of duty or like (108:19 - 108:25)
but there has to be (108:22 - 108:25)
there has to be something in game where (108:26 - 108:29)
it's easy and it's accessible and you (108:27 - 108:31)
can start somewhere (108:29 - 108:34)
because eight no one want to do 20 hours (108:31 - 108:36)
of homework before they want to decide (108:34 - 108:38)
if they want to do something or not like (108:36 - 108:41)
i don't like i want to play apex if i (108:38 - 108:42)
love it (108:41 - 108:44)
then i'll get into the youtube videos so (108:42 - 108:45)
then i'll get the best description of (108:44 - 108:47)
video games in this day and age it's (108:45 - 108:50)
like you have to do homework yeah in (108:47 - 108:52)
order to be able to enjoy a video game (108:50 - 108:54)
it used to be you got a pokemon game it (108:52 - 108:57)
had like a maybe a 20-page manual sure (108:54 - 108:59)
but there were a lot of pictures (108:57 - 109:01)
but when you're ready (108:59 - 109:03)
you knew how to play pokemon (109:01 - 109:05)
now you don't even get a manual and the (109:03 - 109:08)
games are so daggone complex that you've (109:05 - 109:10)
got to perform some sort of arcane (109:08 - 109:13)
ritual just to understand which menu to (109:10 - 109:16)
go do to get to the thing that you want (109:13 - 109:18)
yeah so like for sword shield you know (109:16 - 109:20)
you you cut half the pokemon you get rid (109:18 - 109:21)
of 90 (109:20 - 109:23)
garbage like most people can't even (109:21 - 109:24)
remember what moves they got rid of they (109:23 - 109:26)
got rid of like 90 moves i can only (109:24 - 109:27)
think of one which is hidden power like (109:26 - 109:31)
i can't think hidden power in return (109:27 - 109:32)
no toxic is still there it's just not (109:31 - 109:34)
every pokemon has it yeah (109:32 - 109:36)
that's rude (109:34 - 109:39)
every every pokemon has the right to be (109:36 - 109:42)
toxic (109:39 - 109:42)
anyways uh question of the week (109:44 - 109:48)

expect them to do something that they're (113:13 - 113:16)
not (113:15 - 113:18)
uh i will say this for most parents who (113:16 - 113:20)
want their kids to like (113:18 - 113:21)
what (113:20 - 113:24)
they like they like don't force it on (113:21 - 113:26)
them just keep having it being a big (113:24 - 113:28)
part of your life (113:26 - 113:30)
because kids want to be included on your (113:28 - 113:31)
life so if you invite them in on your (113:30 - 113:35)
journey they're a lot more (113:31 - 113:35)
they're a lot more willing to join and (113:35 - 113:39)
like the thing that you like then is (113:37 - 113:40)
like oh i'm going to force this on (113:39 - 113:41)
you're going to put all these things (113:40 - 113:44)
into your into your head like (113:41 - 113:47)
continue being unashamed of your love of (113:44 - 113:50)
pokemon and your kid will want to be a (113:47 - 113:52)
part of that with you (113:50 - 113:54)
as somebody who read a lot of children's (113:52 - 113:58)
books in the last month to children (113:54 - 113:58)
uh get those pokemon child books those (113:58 - 114:02)
like they're very good they're they're (114:00 - 114:03)
super good like i bought them just (114:02 - 114:05)
because i was like well maybe one day (114:03 - 114:06)
i'll have kids and they're not going to (114:05 - 114:08)
be available for every forever right (114:06 - 114:10)
like books you know they make some money (114:08 - 114:11)
and then they don't make any more (114:10 - 114:15)
not true yeah that's not true (114:11 - 114:17)
if it's only sold on pokemon center i (114:15 - 114:19)
feel like it well technically they put (114:17 - 114:21)
it on amazon too but (114:19 - 114:22)
they did sell out (114:21 - 114:25)
at one point i think they restocked (114:22 - 114:26)
but i went through those books and (114:25 - 114:28)
they're really well made they're really (114:26 - 114:29)
cute (114:28 - 114:31)
um they're like thick there's like a lot (114:29 - 114:32)
of pages get those kids books they're (114:31 - 114:34)
awesome they're like they're on amazon (114:32 - 114:36)
they should be back in stockholm pokemon (114:34 - 114:38)
center just there's four of them (114:36 - 114:39)
get all four they're really great (114:38 - 114:41)
there's colors there's shapes i finally (114:39 - 114:43)
learned what a triangle was last week it (114:41 - 114:46)
was awesome um there's good job letters (114:43 - 114:48)
and i think there's numbers (114:46 - 114:50)
but also like to pass down for your kids (114:48 - 114:52)
like (114:50 - 114:54)
everything that you like (114:52 - 114:57)
let them know like i know a lot of (114:54 - 114:59)
parents like my parents a lot of people (114:57 - 115:01)
from engineers like their parents really (114:59 - 115:03)
they kept their lives very separate and (115:01 - 115:06)
their interests very separate (115:03 - 115:07)
and so it (115:06 - 115:10)
kids just want to spend time with you (115:07 - 115:12)
and like the things that you like (115:10 - 115:15)
so just always be true about like if you (115:12 - 115:18)
are a huge pokemon fan just keep being a (115:15 - 115:21)
big pokemon fan and also accept the fact (115:18 - 115:23)
if your children don't don't like it (115:21 - 115:25)
don't take it stick to it yeah like i'm (115:23 - 115:28)
