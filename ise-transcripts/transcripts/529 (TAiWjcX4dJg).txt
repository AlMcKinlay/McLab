hello (0:33 - 0:36)
uh (0:34 - 0:39)
it's pumpkin spice season (0:36 - 0:42)
new pumpkin spice dropped at the grocery (0:39 - 0:45)
store today early just in time for (0:42 - 0:47)
christmas pumpkin spice eggnog has (0:45 - 0:48)
appeared (0:47 - 0:49)
i know we were worried that we wouldn't (0:48 - 0:52)
make it to christmas but here it is (0:49 - 0:54)
also (0:52 - 0:59)
pumpkin spice chocolate drizzle popcorn (0:54 - 0:59)
you're just making stuff up at this (1:00 - 1:03)
point i'm not i wish i was making this (1:01 - 1:05)
stuff i (1:03 - 1:08)
wish these were not real products that i (1:05 - 1:10)
had to witness with my eyes at the cup (1:08 - 1:14)
of foods yet here we are (1:10 - 1:14)
uh (1:15 - 1:19)
bobby is here (1:16 - 1:19)
hey how's it going uh i (1:19 - 1:23)
have not i don't know that i've ever had (1:21 - 1:25)
anything pumpkin spice whatever (1:23 - 1:28)
bobby why do you deny yourself simple (1:25 - 1:29)
pleasures you live in california that (1:28 - 1:31)
has to be everywhere (1:29 - 1:34)
it is everywhere but like typically the (1:31 - 1:35)
seasons are always the same in (1:34 - 1:36)
california so you don't have to wait for (1:35 - 1:38)
pumpkin spice season it just will appear (1:36 - 1:41)
whenever they get some this is true this (1:38 - 1:43)
is absolutely true here's the key (1:41 - 1:46)
pumpkin spice doesn't taste like pumpkin (1:43 - 1:47)
oh does it not okay (1:46 - 1:50)
spices that go into pumpkin pie (1:47 - 1:52)
vaguely sometimes there's a waffle (1:50 - 1:54)
pumpkin but pumpkin (1:52 - 1:55)
pumpkin (1:54 - 1:56)
cinnamon squash (1:55 - 1:59)
it's timmy chloe nutmeggy (1:56 - 2:02)
yeah not like you too i had no idea i (1:59 - 2:03)
had no idea yeah because i've never (2:02 - 2:05)
tried it and just well i just stay away (2:03 - 2:07)
from pretty all right (2:05 - 2:09)
treat yourself bobby skip a pack of (2:07 - 2:12)
pokemon cards and get yourself a pumpkin (2:09 - 2:14)
spice drizzle popcorn (2:12 - 2:16)
it's actually ironically funny how a (2:14 - 2:17)
pack of pokemon cards is probably the (2:16 - 2:23)
same as a small starbucks drink it is (2:17 - 2:23)
uh (2:23 - 2:26)
we had some pokemon news this week (2:24 - 2:28)
uh we're gonna go through and um there (2:26 - 2:30)
was a new pokemon show for scarlet and (2:28 - 2:31)
violet (2:30 - 2:34)
uh there's some new stuff in pokemon go (2:31 - 2:38)
uh but let's start off with the pokemon (2:34 - 2:40)
unite stuff (2:38 - 2:43)
because it after a full year of no one (2:40 - 2:46)
knowing how to rotate to dreadnaught (2:43 - 2:48)
they removed redna (2:46 - 2:50)
after a full year of people complaining (2:48 - 2:54)
about zapdos they removed zapdos (2:50 - 2:56)
uh and after a full year of people (2:54 - 2:58)
realizing that the little hallway that (2:56 - 3:00)
you try to get to zapdos is probably the (2:58 - 3:03)
worst way to enter the game (3:00 - 3:06)
they removed that hallway instead (3:03 - 3:08)
they made a whole new map (3:06 - 3:10)
um they did (3:08 - 3:13)
and they really like the hiding spots of (3:10 - 3:14)
the new map there's a lot of those it's (3:13 - 3:19)
a whole new map we're playing uh there's (3:14 - 3:21)
also (3:19 - 3:21)
battle pass number ten (3:21 - 3:25)
uh (3:24 - 3:26)
ten (3:25 - 3:28)
yeah we're on we're on ten (3:26 - 3:30)
it was going so quick it's because they (3:28 - 3:33)
do two battle passes a season (3:30 - 3:35)
yeah because they love to double dip and (3:33 - 3:37)
they they're in my opinion not creative (3:35 - 3:40)
enough to make a good battle pass so (3:37 - 3:41)
it's like (3:40 - 3:44)
do you not like theatrical style mew is (3:41 - 3:45)
that what you're saying (3:44 - 3:47)
i i don't i don't like how they gave me (3:45 - 3:50)
you shoes bigger than its head (3:47 - 3:52)
it's it's (3:50 - 3:55)
not great what those shoes are so big on (3:52 - 3:57)
you his feet aren't big mew's feet are (3:55 - 3:59)
bigger than his head big feet (3:57 - 4:01)
oh yeah look at look at mew out of (3:59 - 4:04)
clothing you perv and see how big his (4:01 - 4:07)
feet are you only like clothes on my (4:04 - 4:08)
pokemon (4:07 - 4:10)
if you're playing pokemon unite and your (4:08 - 4:12)
pokemon is naked you're we're losing (4:10 - 4:14)
because you didn't you didn't you didn't (4:12 - 4:18)
pay up to put some clothes on that (4:14 - 4:21)
to be clear the clothes are just um (4:18 - 4:22)
aesthetic right there is not absolutely (4:21 - 4:24)
like okay no okay (4:22 - 4:26)
there is a mental (4:24 - 4:29)

ah didn't realize that that style had so (5:51 - 5:56)
much influence in this uh oh it does oh (5:53 - 5:58)
it does pokemon unite players can look (5:56 - 6:00)
forward to the mythical pokemon mew (5:58 - 6:02)
uh which is now available uh you (6:00 - 6:04)
actually can get mew for free by (6:02 - 6:07)
completing uh uh six mural fragments to (6:04 - 6:09)
unlock me like you could just buy me if (6:07 - 6:11)
you wanted to as well you didn't have to (6:09 - 6:12)
do that (6:11 - 6:15)
um (6:12 - 6:15)
the special event here's october (6:15 - 6:19)
is tough (6:17 - 6:21)
a lot from you to to get this character (6:19 - 6:24)
for free is all i'm saying (6:21 - 6:27)
uh this special event ends october 12th (6:24 - 6:28)
at which point new license will be (6:27 - 6:30)
available in the unite battle committee (6:28 - 6:31)
shop for 12 (6:30 - 6:34)
000 aos gems players will not be able to (6:31 - 6:35)
commit (6:34 - 6:37)
sorry players will not be able to obtain (6:35 - 6:38)
music license (6:37 - 6:40)
at the united battle committee shop (6:38 - 6:41)
during the event but they will be able (6:40 - 6:45)
to use eos gems to progress through muse (6:41 - 6:47)
mural challenge more (6:45 - 6:49)
quickly (6:47 - 6:52)
uh so translated like you can't get you (6:49 - 6:54)
can't buy immune now you can only they (6:52 - 6:56)
they're doing a thing now with (6:54 - 6:58)
characters where sometimes they did this (6:56 - 6:59)
with um (6:58 - 7:02)
i think like lacie and espeon where you (6:59 - 7:05)
couldn't use coins to buy them (7:02 - 7:09)
but you could spend some form of gems to (7:05 - 7:11)
get them because coins you can't coins (7:09 - 7:13)
are just free that you earn playing the (7:11 - 7:14)
game (7:13 - 7:17)
gems you only get from giving the game (7:14 - 7:18)
real money (7:17 - 7:20)
so they'll put this artificial like if (7:18 - 7:22)
you want it (7:20 - 7:24)
you have to either do our challenge (7:22 - 7:27)
which is play a lot of our video game or (7:24 - 7:29)
you can give us real money (7:27 - 7:31)
and if you don't want to do either (7:29 - 7:34)
you can wait two weeks or three weeks (7:31 - 7:36)
and you can spend the coins you've (7:34 - 7:37)
earned (7:36 - 7:39)
for the character (7:37 - 7:40)
so (7:39 - 7:43)
i'm a huge mew fan uh does this mean i (7:40 - 7:44)
should start playing unite is this worth (7:43 - 7:48)
it is me you like playing you good or do (7:44 - 7:51)
you keep playing the same chara like (7:48 - 7:52)
pokemon all the time or do you switch it (7:51 - 7:55)
up constantly and unite i uh (7:52 - 7:57)
depends on what there are people like (7:55 - 7:59)
steve who will only play cram and right (7:57 - 8:01)
hurt his entire team (7:59 - 8:03)
and other people like me who switch (8:01 - 8:05)
between characters based on our needs (8:03 - 8:07)
okay uh (8:05 - 8:09)
mew is (8:07 - 8:09)
maybe the most technical and (8:10 - 8:16)
difficult character they've done (8:14 - 8:18)
yet (8:16 - 8:20)
more than who because (8:18 - 8:21)
because (8:20 - 8:22)
mew (8:21 - 8:24)
every time (8:22 - 8:26)
i think it's every time you score and (8:24 - 8:28)
every time you level up (8:26 - 8:30)
you get to change (8:28 - 8:31)
moves (8:30 - 8:34)
but the problem is is that when you (8:31 - 8:36)
score in the middle of a battle (8:34 - 8:38)
you no longer have moves because you (8:36 - 8:40)
have to decide immediately (8:38 - 8:43)
what moves you're going to pick for the (8:40 - 8:45)
next whatever amount of time (8:43 - 8:47)
and unlike regular moves where you can (8:45 - 8:49)
just let it sit up there and the timer (8:47 - 8:51)
down and you have access to it to the (8:49 - 8:53)
move from before (8:51 - 8:56)
no they disappear and you have to pick (8:53 - 8:57)
your moves (8:56 - 8:59)
immediately (8:57 - 9:00)
so (8:59 - 9:02)
you have to sort of know which direction (9:00 - 9:04)
on the d-pad are the ones that you want (9:02 - 9:06)
so you can hit them fast (9:04 - 9:07)
uh (9:06 - 9:10)
while still trying to pay attention (9:07 - 9:12)
to everything else (9:10 - 9:15)
and so it is a bit (9:12 - 9:17)
complicated and then there's the barrier (9:15 - 9:19)
interaction because if you fire things (9:17 - 9:21)
through the barrier (9:19 - 9:24)
their increased (9:21 - 9:25)
it's like (9:24 - 9:28)
it's it's a very interesting character (9:25 - 9:29)
but i haven't even played it yet i've (9:28 - 9:31)
watched people play it i'm like this is (9:29 - 9:36)
really complicated and people who are (9:31 - 9:38)
go who are going to get good with mu are (9:36 - 9:40)
going to be really tough to play against (9:38 - 9:42)
because you never know what what's (9:40 - 9:45)
coming like you can't predict (9:42 - 9:48)
of the six moves what combination they (9:45 - 9:49)
have (9:48 - 9:52)
the problem i had with um (9:49 - 9:54)
so so they did a bunch of buffs and (9:52 - 9:57)
nerves and they they did like (9:54 - 9:59)
terribly nerf crammer ant to the point (9:57 - 10:00)
where it's like (9:59 - 10:02)
they've nerfed cramer in the past and (10:00 - 10:04)
they've nerfed like pokemon like lucario (10:02 - 10:05)
in the past and they've still been like (10:04 - 10:07)
good (10:05 - 10:09)
like they did like four lucario nerfs at (10:07 - 10:11)
one point and like it was still good (10:09 - 10:13)
like the entire time it wasn't until (10:11 - 10:15)
like the most recent lucario nerf where (10:13 - 10:17)
people were like okay now it's (10:15 - 10:20)
officially bad um (10:17 - 10:21)
but they they (10:20 - 10:22)
they (10:21 - 10:24)
so they did this weird thing which they (10:22 - 10:25)
didn't really talk about here where they (10:24 - 10:27)
nerfed pretty much every single unite (10:25 - 10:29)
move every united move is yeah (10:27 - 10:30)
they did (10:29 - 10:31)
so (10:30 - 10:33)
in the first year of playing the game (10:31 - 10:35)
when you united (10:33 - 10:38)
um it really made you like go like super (10:35 - 10:41)
saiyan goku for a hot second you do this (10:38 - 10:43)
crazy amount of damage you get this huge (10:41 - 10:46)
speed boost normally um even if you (10:43 - 10:47)
messed up your unite and you weren't (10:46 - 10:49)
playing cramer ant you could like run (10:47 - 10:50)
away the reason i say like because (10:49 - 10:52)
cramer ants unite move like locks him to (10:50 - 10:54)
the ground i think he's the only one (10:52 - 10:56)
that like locks him down um everyone (10:54 - 11:00)
else does it does that lock you down (10:56 - 11:02)
yeah but they like do it really quick (11:00 - 11:04)
and then they can move um where like (11:02 - 11:06)
cram is like oh you're locked down the (11:04 - 11:10)
entire united move unless you cancel it (11:06 - 11:11)
and then you can run around (11:10 - 11:14)
um so they (11:11 - 11:16)
they changed it where like unite moves (11:14 - 11:19)
are still like a powerful move but it's (11:16 - 11:21)
not like this super saiyan mode anymore (11:19 - 11:23)
it's just like (11:21 - 11:24)
a button to be a little bit more (11:23 - 11:26)
powerful for a couple seconds and then (11:24 - 11:29)
the game's back to normal (11:26 - 11:30)
and it was like (11:29 - 11:32)
they don't talk about it at all in this (11:30 - 11:35)
press release (11:32 - 11:37)
even if they change nothing else (11:35 - 11:39)
the fact that unite move doesn't make (11:37 - 11:42)
you super saiyan anymore is a pretty big (11:39 - 11:43)
deal (11:42 - 11:44)
um yeah (11:43 - 11:46)
because you would save that in an (11:44 - 11:48)
instance for like um (11:46 - 11:50)
like oh i'm in trouble and this will get (11:48 - 11:52)
me out of trouble (11:50 - 11:54)
uh and it kind of still does that but (11:52 - 11:57)
not as consistent i would say (11:54 - 12:00)
yeah i mean so instead of every unite (11:57 - 12:01)
move (12:00 - 12:05)
getting the exact same (12:01 - 12:07)
change so you used to get a speed boost (12:05 - 12:11)
an attack boost and uh (12:07 - 12:13)
sometimes defense boost (12:11 - 12:15)
now each (12:13 - 12:18)
unit gets a different (12:15 - 12:22)
boost based off of what (12:18 - 12:25)
type of character they are so support (12:22 - 12:27)
the support boost is different than the (12:25 - 12:28)
attacker boost which is different than (12:27 - 12:31)
the defender boost (12:28 - 12:31)
a good thing or a bad thing (12:33 - 12:37)
i i i (12:38 - 12:42)
if we're if we're just talking like the (12:40 - 12:43)
pure if we're just talking about the (12:42 - 12:46)
pure aspects of making a game fun i (12:43 - 12:48)
think hitting your (12:46 - 12:50)
here's the thing let's cancel out like (12:48 - 12:52)
unite all together and let's go to other (12:50 - 12:55)
games that have like ultimates like apex (12:52 - 12:58)
legends or overwatch or destiny (12:55 - 13:00)
i played what four or five years of (12:58 - 13:03)
destiny and every time i popped my super (13:00 - 13:04)
that's what they called it in that game (13:03 - 13:06)
it felt great it felt like you were (13:04 - 13:08)
powerful for a second um it felt really (13:06 - 13:12)
rewarding using it same thing and um (13:08 - 13:14)
apex well most characters in apex (13:12 - 13:17)
legends have like decent ultimates but (13:14 - 13:19)
like (13:17 - 13:19)
i felt like when they changed it in (13:20 - 13:23)
unite it kind of took away a little bit (13:21 - 13:25)
of the fun (13:23 - 13:26)
okay (13:25 - 13:29)
yeah i mean so for example kramer is an (13:26 - 13:30)
attacker right (13:29 - 13:31)
yeah (13:30 - 13:32)
yeah so (13:31 - 13:35)
for so instead of getting a super big (13:32 - 13:38)
speed boost which is now given only to (13:35 - 13:41)
speedsters (13:38 - 13:43)
attackers now get a (13:41 - 13:45)
a shield it's not very strong but it (13:43 - 13:47)
gives you a little bit of defense (13:45 - 13:51)
the movement speed is increased (13:47 - 13:52)
a little bit (13:51 - 13:55)
but their attack speed or (13:52 - 13:58)
their move cooldown is reduced so what (13:55 - 14:02)
unites moves do now is they (13:58 - 14:05)
lean heavily into what your role is (14:02 - 14:07)
supposed to do (14:05 - 14:09)
and it's hard to say if that's better or (14:07 - 14:11)
worse because everybody was so used to (14:09 - 14:14)
how it was before yeah and you you (14:11 - 14:16)
played a very specific way because okay (14:14 - 14:19)
i can hit my unite (14:16 - 14:21)
and like i play el degas i would fly up (14:19 - 14:23)
in the air hit unite and then i would (14:21 - 14:24)
zip around that map healing everybody (14:23 - 14:26)
because i could move so fast (14:24 - 14:28)
i don't get to do that anymore and i (14:26 - 14:31)
don't know (14:28 - 14:34)
what i get to do other than for support (14:31 - 14:36)
my cooldowns are are (14:34 - 14:38)
greatly reduced so technically i can (14:36 - 14:40)
stay in the fight and use my moves (14:38 - 14:41)
faster (14:40 - 14:43)
but (14:41 - 14:46)
i used to usually used it to get it was (14:43 - 14:47)
like you're oh my gosh i'm being teamed (14:46 - 14:50)
up on i'm gonna and get out of here and (14:47 - 14:51)
you can't (14:50 - 14:54)
do that anymore and the game has really (14:51 - 14:57)
shifted both in the map (14:54 - 14:59)
and in how they move how they do their (14:57 - 15:00)
moves from (14:59 - 15:03)
you can kind of just be on your own (15:00 - 15:04)
to (15:03 - 15:07)
team fights are incredibly important and (15:04 - 15:09)
you need to keep doing them at all times (15:07 - 15:11)
right you need to be beating on each (15:09 - 15:13)
other pretty much all the time through (15:11 - 15:15)
the game right right (15:13 - 15:17)
uh and that's really shown in how they (15:15 - 15:19)
change the regis (15:17 - 15:22)
yeah so starting on september 2nd (15:19 - 15:24)
ranked matches and standard matches will (15:22 - 15:25)
take place in the (15:24 - 15:28)
how do we say this the thea (15:25 - 15:32)
yeah yes yeah thea skyrunes above eos (15:28 - 15:33)
island (15:32 - 15:35)
on this new map legendary giants reggie (15:33 - 15:37)
ella key reggie rock reggie ice and (15:35 - 15:40)
reggie steele will make their debut so (15:37 - 15:42)
sorry reggie draco somebody forgot to (15:40 - 15:44)
drink are you out (15:42 - 15:46)
reggie eliqui will be at the top of the (15:44 - 15:48)
map if you defeat it uh it will fight (15:46 - 15:50)
for your team as an extremely reliable (15:48 - 15:51)
ally (15:50 - 15:53)
that will attack the opposing team goal (15:51 - 15:55)
zones reggie rock reggie ice reggie (15:53 - 15:57)
steele will appear at the bottom of the (15:55 - 15:58)
map and the team that defeats it will be (15:57 - 16:01)
temporarily powered up the bonuses for (15:58 - 16:03)
defeating reggie rock regis and reggie (16:01 - 16:05)
steele will differ (16:03 - 16:08)
meaning battles can unfold in a myriad (16:05 - 16:09)
of ways i didn't actually know the three (16:08 - 16:10)
were different (16:09 - 16:13)
yeah they are different and (16:10 - 16:16)
the final two minutes (16:13 - 16:19)
sky-high pokemon rayquaza will appear (16:16 - 16:21)
more often in the center (16:19 - 16:23)
uh or will appear in the center if the (16:21 - 16:25)
team defeats rayquaza it will receive a (16:23 - 16:27)
temporary shield (16:25 - 16:29)
while active uh will increase the attack (16:27 - 16:32)
power and goal scoring speed that makes (16:29 - 16:36)
scoring attempts unblockable (16:32 - 16:36)
uh (16:38 - 16:41)
so (16:39 - 16:41)
not okay so (16:42 - 16:45)
i think (16:44 - 16:47)
my opinion on this is i was so excited (16:45 - 16:49)
for the new map (16:47 - 16:51)
and as somebody who like i said earlier (16:49 - 16:53)
plays apex legends or destiny when they (16:51 - 16:56)
introduce new maps um (16:53 - 16:58)
it's always like exciting (16:56 - 17:00)
but usually when they introduce new maps (16:58 - 17:02)
they do introduce new mechanics but they (17:00 - 17:04)
also at the same time don't drastically (17:02 - 17:07)
change so many of the mechanics i mean (17:04 - 17:08)
the game (17:07 - 17:10)
the game doesn't play at all the same (17:08 - 17:11)
anymore (17:10 - 17:14)
it's like everybody has to re-learn how (17:11 - 17:16)
to play this game so now's your time for (17:14 - 17:18)
me to jump in if i decided i wanted to (17:16 - 17:20)
actually yeah i mean (17:18 - 17:23)
the thing is (17:20 - 17:23)
the reggie's at the bottom the only one (17:23 - 17:29)
that seems to really be worth catching (17:26 - 17:30)
uh is (17:29 - 17:33)
reggie steele they still do give an (17:30 - 17:36)
experience boost but nothing like (17:33 - 17:38)
it used to be (17:36 - 17:40)
and because the game really now focuses (17:38 - 17:43)
on team fights and because (17:40 - 17:46)
rayquaza is so different (17:43 - 17:49)
scoring throughout the game is almost (17:46 - 17:52)
more important than anything else so now (17:49 - 17:54)
the constant battle (17:52 - 17:57)
on the map is well what is the team (17:54 - 17:59)
going to choose are you going to go to (17:57 - 18:01)
reggie lucky (17:59 - 18:03)
because you'll get huge scores and (18:01 - 18:05)
reggie fights (18:03 - 18:07)
remarkably well and does a lot of damage (18:05 - 18:09)
to the other team (18:07 - 18:11)
or do you run down to see which reggie (18:09 - 18:15)
popped up but if he didn't get steel (18:11 - 18:17)
then what do you do because rock and ice (18:15 - 18:19)
are okay but they aren't (18:17 - 18:21)
really game changing and you've wasted (18:19 - 18:24)
your time going down there (18:21 - 18:24)
there was like a an eye-opening moment (18:27 - 18:32)
because i i did think rayquaza worked (18:29 - 18:34)
exactly like zapdos right (18:32 - 18:36)
like if you're if (18:34 - 18:37)
if you don't listen to a pokemon podcast (18:36 - 18:39)
if you're not like (18:37 - 18:40)
like like even on the press release here (18:39 - 18:42)
it doesn't say that like rayquaza (18:40 - 18:43)
is (18:42 - 18:45)
like it says that it (18:43 - 18:48)
increases your score goaling capacity (18:45 - 18:50)
which is what zapdos technically did but (18:48 - 18:52)
it doesn't clearly say it's different no (18:50 - 18:54)
it's very different so i'm playing a (18:52 - 18:56)
match and like we're winning it's it's (18:54 - 18:59)
like you're in the lead like keep it up (18:56 - 19:00)
you're hot or whatever whatever like (18:59 - 19:02)
weird things the announcer says like and (19:00 - 19:04)
it's saying that the whole match (19:02 - 19:05)
um (19:04 - 19:08)
and then i'm like i'm like waiting in (19:05 - 19:11)
the grass for rayquaza and like rayquaza (19:08 - 19:13)
pops up and like i'm just waiting to use (19:11 - 19:16)
my ultimate and uh the tyranitar my team (19:13 - 19:18)
is is getting attacked and i was like i (19:16 - 19:20)
can't i can't save you like (19:18 - 19:22)
like most of our team is dead i'm (19:20 - 19:24)
waiting here in the grass because our (19:22 - 19:25)
only (19:24 - 19:27)
hey the only way i can take this is if i (19:25 - 19:28)
can snipe it at the very end so that's (19:27 - 19:30)
that's my plan because everyone else is (19:28 - 19:32)
dead and this tyrant is getting like 4v1 (19:30 - 19:34)
and i i ain't gonna i can't help you (19:32 - 19:36)
right you can't help there's no help (19:34 - 19:38)
making that so right right before right (19:36 - 19:41)
before he dies he just runs into the (19:38 - 19:43)
grass where i'm hiding and then uh the (19:41 - 19:45)
other four people see me and now i'm (19:43 - 19:49)
dead because like he just like led them (19:45 - 19:51)
right to me so now our whole team is (19:49 - 19:53)
dead and i was like my one opportunity (19:51 - 19:55)
of like wait for this rakeways to be (19:53 - 19:57)
like 10 hp and then pop out of the grass (19:55 - 19:59)
like i thought i was gonna have this (19:57 - 20:02)
real like call of duty uh 360 no scope (19:59 - 20:04)
moment here it doesn't happen so they (20:02 - 20:06)
they take rayquaza and i was like okay (20:04 - 20:09)
well we lost like (20:06 - 20:11)
it's over and they take requests and (20:09 - 20:13)
then they dunk and then the last and (20:11 - 20:16)
they and then i'm like oh the the (20:13 - 20:18)
zones don't have the like countdown (20:16 - 20:20)
above them that's weird (20:18 - 20:22)
and then somebody in my twitch chat was (20:20 - 20:23)
like oh yeah it's it's it's different (20:22 - 20:26)
now it's like goal getter so you do (20:23 - 20:28)
which i don't know how different that is (20:26 - 20:29)
like you can can you still you can't you (20:28 - 20:31)
can still be stopped (20:29 - 20:32)
yeah so (20:31 - 20:34)
what what it does now is it puts the (20:32 - 20:37)
gold gator shield around you and if you (20:34 - 20:39)
focus on fighting them (20:37 - 20:42)
you will break that shield and then (20:39 - 20:44)
they're back to just a normal (20:42 - 20:46)
well it's always a normal scoring speed (20:44 - 20:48)
but the thing is is with the shield on (20:46 - 20:50)
you can sit there and not be interrupted (20:48 - 20:52)
but if your team attacks and you break (20:50 - 20:53)
their shields (20:52 - 20:56)
then you can interrupt them from scoring (20:53 - 20:58)
so rari quasa isn't an automatic win (20:56 - 21:01)
anymore and i have played a lot of games (20:58 - 21:04)
now where nobody goes for ruriquaza (21:01 - 21:06)
because why not just if you're (21:04 - 21:08)
overpowered just overpower them and pop (21:06 - 21:11)
their goals don't even bother the thing (21:08 - 21:12)
in the middle because it's going to do (21:11 - 21:14)
damage to you (21:12 - 21:16)
and (21:14 - 21:18)
you're already overpowering them so you (21:16 - 21:20)
can just defeat the other team and score (21:18 - 21:22)
and never worry about the score shield (21:20 - 21:25)
and if you're behind (21:22 - 21:27)
and you haven't kept up in leveling (21:25 - 21:29)
getting the score shield won't make a (21:27 - 21:30)
difference because the team is way more (21:29 - 21:33)
powerful the minute you approach they (21:30 - 21:34)
burst your score shield and then they (21:33 - 21:36)
mow you down because they've been doing (21:34 - 21:38)
that to do the entire game (21:36 - 21:40)
so (21:38 - 21:43)
it's only in very close battles where (21:40 - 21:45)
you have been focusing on trying to deny (21:43 - 21:47)
the other team leveling while trying to (21:45 - 21:49)
level yourself as much (21:47 - 21:51)
and the game is just a completely (21:49 - 21:53)
different game now (21:51 - 21:55)
well yeah and they they took rayquaza (21:53 - 21:57)
and then they you know they scored a (21:55 - 21:58)
bunch because we're all dead we're all (21:57 - 21:59)
dead (21:58 - 22:00)
and then i was like well we lost and (21:59 - 22:02)
then the the game results came in and we (22:00 - 22:05)
like still won because our our front (22:02 - 22:08)
eight minutes were so good yeah compared (22:05 - 22:10)
to their last two which you would think (22:08 - 22:12)
is like (22:10 - 22:14)
which is funny because like a year ago (22:12 - 22:16)
that's what people said like (22:14 - 22:17)
hey if we play good for eight minutes (22:16 - 22:20)
why do we get punished the last two and (22:17 - 22:21)
then people just kind of got used to it (22:20 - 22:24)
right people just like but it also made (22:21 - 22:26)
it like there was a game last week where (22:24 - 22:29)
um we were losing we were losing we were (22:26 - 22:32)
losing and then the team actually (22:29 - 22:35)
voted to concede before zapdos (22:32 - 22:37)
and it was so frustrating for me because (22:35 - 22:38)
i was the one person that was like why (22:37 - 22:40)
would we concede zapdos isn't up because (22:38 - 22:42)
i've always been on the receiving end (22:40 - 22:43)
where you're winning you're winning (22:42 - 22:44)
you're winning and then they take zapdos (22:43 - 22:47)
and you lose yeah and it's like (22:44 - 22:49)
we're losing we're losing we're losing (22:47 - 22:52)
we can still take zapdos and win like (22:49 - 22:54)
why would you concede when like this (22:52 - 22:58)
mechanic is built to like sway the tide (22:54 - 23:00)
and (22:58 - 23:02)
i don't know if the team at (23:00 - 23:05)
you timmy time i whoever may i don't (23:02 - 23:07)
know if they've done a like (23:05 - 23:09)
they clearly (23:07 - 23:11)
i would assume at least (23:09 - 23:12)
did enough (23:11 - 23:14)
research and probably know what paths (23:12 - 23:16)
people were taking where people were (23:14 - 23:18)
going and they they designed this map (23:16 - 23:20)
around it but i wonder if they they (23:18 - 23:24)
thought like this swinging mechanic that (23:20 - 23:25)
is zapdos (23:24 - 23:27)
is so frustrating to (23:25 - 23:32)
casual people that that that alone (23:27 - 23:34)
turned people off from this game (23:32 - 23:37)
oh yeah absolutely (23:34 - 23:41)
and like it also changed the necess like (23:37 - 23:43)
the frustration of people not going down (23:41 - 23:46)
to dread is now (23:43 - 23:46)
slightly less frustrating because you (23:46 - 23:50)
don't know what's down there until it (23:48 - 23:51)
spawns (23:50 - 23:53)
and (23:51 - 23:54)
reggie (23:53 - 23:56)
ice is the worst because you just get an (23:54 - 23:59)
hp regeneration buff which doesn't make (23:56 - 24:00)
any difference (23:59 - 24:02)
reggie rock gives you a defense and (24:00 - 24:06)
special defense buff but that's (24:02 - 24:07)
the way the game is built with the (24:06 - 24:09)
emblems that doesn't make that much of a (24:07 - 24:11)
difference either so reggie steele (24:09 - 24:13)
giving you attention special attack (24:11 - 24:16)
buffs oh it gives you which (24:13 - 24:18)
which gives you that that is the buff (24:16 - 24:20)
you want because you just become super (24:18 - 24:23)
powered for a while and it's hard to (24:20 - 24:25)
decide so (24:23 - 24:26)
then it does the new thing come (24:25 - 24:29)
everybody go up and fights reggie lucky (24:26 - 24:30)
to see which way you're gonna send it (24:29 - 24:32)
down and then people go down does maybe (24:30 - 24:35)
catch the buff or is it one person stays (24:32 - 24:36)
down there and tries to take out the (24:35 - 24:38)
reggie to maybe give you a buff at the (24:36 - 24:42)
end it there are so many questions (24:38 - 24:45)
about what is optimal on this new map it (24:42 - 24:48)
is (24:45 - 24:48)
it's refreshing and frustrating because (24:48 - 24:52)
all the skills that i had i'm like i (24:51 - 24:55)
don't know how to apply them anymore (24:52 - 24:57)
i don't know what i'm supposed to do (24:55 - 24:58)
anymore (24:57 - 25:00)
yeah i mean like (24:58 - 25:03)
not only is the new map like tougher to (25:00 - 25:04)
learn (25:03 - 25:08)
because you're so used to like your your (25:04 - 25:09)
where you're walking like what's (25:08 - 25:11)
spawning at what times and obviously (25:09 - 25:13)
like with time you'll you'll be like (25:11 - 25:15)
okay nachos spawn here and (25:13 - 25:18)
uh the selgore spawns here like (25:15 - 25:21)
you'll get used to it but (25:18 - 25:23)
like you also have to have the struggle (25:21 - 25:24)
of everyone else trying to figure that (25:23 - 25:27)
out as well (25:24 - 25:30)
um and then the the (25:27 - 25:33)
the unite move nerf was (25:30 - 25:35)
like kind of out of nowhere and it was (25:33 - 25:36)
like yeah this is probably better for (25:35 - 25:38)
the long term but then they also nerfed (25:36 - 25:40)
emblems which like (25:38 - 25:43)
probably needed a nerf but they like (25:40 - 25:44)
nerfed like (25:43 - 25:47)
black was arguably the best (25:44 - 25:50)
oh yeah yeah and i i built my kramer ant (25:47 - 25:51)
around black (25:50 - 25:55)
and i played and i was like this feels (25:51 - 25:56)
worse (25:55 - 25:59)
than before emblems even existed (25:56 - 26:02)
and i removed the black and i was like i (25:59 - 26:04)
it doesn't even feel any different like (26:02 - 26:07)
black is like so useless now like you're (26:04 - 26:09)
just wasting spots with black (26:07 - 26:11)
but then it's like (26:09 - 26:14)
i don't have the other emblems to like (26:11 - 26:16)
fill in (26:14 - 26:18)
yeah i mean i have a i have a green (26:16 - 26:20)
black build right now that i'm going to (26:18 - 26:22)
have to switch over to a green white (26:20 - 26:25)
build i think because that the white so (26:22 - 26:26)
black (26:25 - 26:27)
got (26:26 - 26:29)
um (26:27 - 26:30)
hit hard (26:29 - 26:32)
which (26:30 - 26:34)
i i think they hit it way too hard like (26:32 - 26:36)
they cut it in half because it used to (26:34 - 26:38)
be 2 4 percent and now it's one percent (26:36 - 26:41)
two percent four percent yeah which is (26:38 - 26:42)
still (26:41 - 26:46)
okay but not great (26:42 - 26:50)
um and they also lowered (26:46 - 26:50)
uh the critical hit chance (26:51 - 26:56)
so people used to go with crit they (26:55 - 26:59)
lowered that but they did increase (26:56 - 27:01)
special attack and attacks bonuses a (26:59 - 27:02)
little bit (27:01 - 27:04)
and they added some new ones they had (27:02 - 27:05)
like a dark (27:04 - 27:07)
they had a navy which i didn't even know (27:05 - 27:08)
what navy does yet because i don't have (27:07 - 27:11)
anything with navy navy is uh reduces (27:08 - 27:14)
your unite move cooldown (27:11 - 27:18)
so you get your unite more often (27:14 - 27:18)
it's probably like like there are some (27:19 - 27:22)
pokemon that get unites way faster like (27:20 - 27:25)
zumarroll gets it way quicker than like (27:22 - 27:27)
craymarand does (27:25 - 27:29)
yeah i mean i guess with the unite (27:27 - 27:31)
changes that makes it different it's (27:29 - 27:35)
like it's really hard to (27:31 - 27:35)
figure out (27:37 - 27:42)
what is the optimal builds like it is it (27:40 - 27:43)
is a (27:42 - 27:46)
it's as if they released unite again for (27:43 - 27:48)
the first time a year later like i said (27:46 - 27:50)
it sounds like it's a [ __ ] (27:48 - 27:53)
update they changed everything it was (27:50 - 27:56)
huge and i don't think anybody expected (27:53 - 27:58)
them to do as much as they did i mean (27:56 - 28:01)
like mr mime (27:58 - 28:02)
is a whole new character (28:01 - 28:04)
had moves completely changed they just (28:02 - 28:06)
said those old moves were bad and we're (28:04 - 28:08)
changing them if you have to go to the (28:06 - 28:10)
official united website where it talks (28:08 - 28:12)
about like buffs and nerfs (28:10 - 28:15)
it'll be like kramer dive from (28:12 - 28:17)
seven seconds to eight seconds and then (28:15 - 28:19)
like air slash from like seven point (28:17 - 28:20)
five to eight point five because they (28:19 - 28:22)
added like a second to each of its moves (28:20 - 28:26)
and then mr mime is like 17 paragraphs (28:22 - 28:27)
it's like (28:26 - 28:31)
a completely different character (28:27 - 28:33)
like in the thinking of those readings (28:31 - 28:35)
like mr mr survive needed to work he was (28:33 - 28:38)
a little too weird (28:35 - 28:40)
so they just reworked everything which (28:38 - 28:41)
again (28:40 - 28:42)
people like (28:41 - 28:45)
so now they're going to go and fix guard (28:42 - 28:47)
chomp and fix crosstalk because they've (28:45 - 28:48)
already said we will just (28:47 - 28:50)
completely swap out moves to make them (28:48 - 28:51)
better (28:50 - 28:53)
so those are probably the next up to (28:51 - 28:55)
have everything completely changed but (28:53 - 28:58)
it's wild to have (28:55 - 29:01)
a year after and after you did the (28:58 - 29:03)
professional (29:01 - 29:05)
competition to say (29:03 - 29:07)
guess what everything that you saw in (29:05 - 29:08)
that competition doesn't apply anymore (29:07 - 29:11)
because we've changed the game (29:08 - 29:12)
it's funny too because they like sold (29:11 - 29:14)
like those characters and those skins (29:12 - 29:16)
yeah discount that's what i was gonna (29:14 - 29:18)
say like all the people that spent all (29:16 - 29:19)
the money (29:18 - 29:21)
zarina was came out of that competition (29:19 - 29:23)
as like the obvious like dominant (29:21 - 29:25)
pokemon and then they like nerfed zarina (29:23 - 29:27)
and it's like ah i don't know if it's (29:25 - 29:28)
good anymore (29:27 - 29:32)
yeah like stop is lasts (29:28 - 29:32)
yeah i (29:32 - 29:35)
you know what they didn't change they (29:35 - 29:38)
didn't change that membership that (29:37 - 29:39)
membership's still bad yeah the (29:38 - 29:41)
membership was still bad (29:39 - 29:44)
but like it's hard to figure out where (29:41 - 29:46)
to go (29:44 - 29:46)
from here which is both exciting and (29:46 - 29:52)
frustrating because (29:49 - 29:54)
like i want to get back to where i felt (29:52 - 29:57)
like i was good at the game and i just (29:54 - 29:59)
don't know what the game (29:57 - 30:02)
is right now or how to apply the skills (29:59 - 30:04)
that i had before (30:02 - 30:06)
and i don't know what priorities are (30:04 - 30:08)
anymore and the jungle is a lot bigger (30:06 - 30:10)
and things are (30:08 - 30:12)
things spawn like the attack lane now (30:10 - 30:14)
has multiple (30:12 - 30:16)
zatu's in it so (30:14 - 30:19)
like the attackers have a lot more to (30:16 - 30:21)
kill up there to get more experience and (30:19 - 30:24)
then it seems very easy to get to (30:21 - 30:26)
level 15 at the end of this map that it (30:24 - 30:27)
was (30:26 - 30:29)
for other maps (30:27 - 30:32)
yeah and you have to get (30:29 - 30:34)
most of your team up to 1415 (30:32 - 30:37)
because rayquaza isn't a guaranteed wit (30:34 - 30:38)
anymore (30:37 - 30:40)
like you used to be able to lag behind (30:38 - 30:41)
and if you all saved your night moves (30:40 - 30:43)
and went hard on zapdos you could win (30:41 - 30:46)
that game and then it's not this game (30:43 - 30:48)
anymore (30:46 - 30:48)
yeah i i would i feel like i don't know (30:48 - 30:52)
if (30:51 - 30:54)
greg you were gonna you were gonna say (30:52 - 30:56)
this but i feel like because there were (30:54 - 30:59)
so many things changed i don't know if i (30:56 - 31:01)
have the motivation to like (30:59 - 31:04)
learn it all again (31:01 - 31:07)
mean i've i have played a lot in the (31:04 - 31:09)
last three days and (31:07 - 31:11)
overall i see the map's layout is a lot (31:09 - 31:14)
better than it was (31:11 - 31:16)
and (31:14 - 31:16)
team fighting is more important so it's (31:17 - 31:23)
more important to level up and get into (31:20 - 31:27)
team fights than it ever was which means (31:23 - 31:27)
it also shifts the dynamics if you're (31:28 - 31:31)
working with a group invoice you're (31:30 - 31:33)
going to have an absolute better (31:31 - 31:36)
experience than anything else (31:33 - 31:41)
i'm excited by the changes i just (31:36 - 31:41)
i just don't know if it's better (31:42 - 31:50)
i think i think it's better for (31:46 - 31:50)
new players i don't think there was (31:51 - 31:56)
anything we talked about this like six (31:53 - 31:58)
months ago like what can unite do to (31:56 - 32:01)
bring back people that isn't like okay (31:58 - 32:02)
let's release umbreon let's release (32:01 - 32:05)
leafeon let's release like you'll get (32:02 - 32:07)
people who really like a pokemon that (32:05 - 32:08)
will (32:07 - 32:09)
come back but then they're gonna (32:08 - 32:11)
remember like oh yeah this game is still (32:09 - 32:13)
this game and like yeah my favorite (32:11 - 32:16)
pokemon is here but (32:13 - 32:18)
so i think if you're like (32:16 - 32:19)
what are all the things that pushed away (32:18 - 32:23)
people and how can we make this a more (32:19 - 32:24)
i don't want to use the word fair but (32:23 - 32:26)
how can we make this like a more (32:24 - 32:28)
accessible game yeah (32:26 - 32:30)
more balanced (32:28 - 32:32)
yeah so people don't feel so slighted (32:30 - 32:34)
when it comes to something like a zapdos (32:32 - 32:36)
or or even like the hardcore people that (32:34 - 32:37)
are like rotate to dreaddoll and it's (32:36 - 32:39)
like (32:37 - 32:41)
every good player was in agreement to (32:39 - 32:43)
rotating to dreadnought but it was (32:41 - 32:45)
really hard to communicate that to like (32:43 - 32:46)
a casual player (32:45 - 32:49)
that like rotom was so useless (32:46 - 32:51)
and now that they buffed (32:49 - 32:54)
eleki to be much much better than rotom (32:51 - 32:56)
and then they way better than and then (32:54 - 32:58)
they changed the three reggies were like (32:56 - 33:00)
they're not all that good it's like it's (32:58 - 33:02)
harder to make that argument where (33:00 - 33:03)
somebody's like i'm going to eloke and (33:02 - 33:05)
you're like no you're a casual player (33:03 - 33:06)
it's like nah that's actually maybe the (33:05 - 33:09)
the better choice here yeah like (33:06 - 33:12)
you have to sort of read how (33:09 - 33:15)
the battles have been going and decide (33:12 - 33:17)
but (33:15 - 33:19)
in a non-voice game where you're playing (33:17 - 33:23)
with strangers that's really hard to do (33:19 - 33:25)
um (33:23 - 33:29)
yeah i don't know i (33:25 - 33:29)
i like that i'm surprised (33:32 - 33:38)
and i like that it feels incredibly (33:35 - 33:39)
fresh (33:38 - 33:40)
i just (33:39 - 33:41)
don't (33:40 - 33:43)
know (33:41 - 33:45)
if ultimately the experience once all (33:43 - 33:49)
the dust settles will be (33:45 - 33:53)
a good one across the board (33:49 - 33:53)
i think i think if you were if you were (33:54 - 33:57)
always on the fence of coming back to (33:56 - 33:59)
unite i think now is the time oh yeah (33:57 - 34:02)
now it's the time to give it a shot and (33:59 - 34:03)
get you for free (34:02 - 34:05)
what i was telling my (34:03 - 34:06)
what i was telling my twitch chat is (34:05 - 34:09)
like i feel like i'm at the point where (34:06 - 34:11)
they did way too many nerfs (34:09 - 34:12)
and (34:11 - 34:15)
that some things still feel like we (34:12 - 34:17)
don't know (34:15 - 34:19)
so i feel like for me it might be better (34:17 - 34:22)
to hold off until like the next balance (34:19 - 34:23)
patch (34:22 - 34:25)
yeah i mean the weird thing the weird (34:23 - 34:27)
thing about cram is (34:25 - 34:31)
they increased the moves and (34:27 - 34:33)
nerfed the emblems which is what made (34:31 - 34:36)
cram so dominant (34:33 - 34:39)
cram was good before emblems (34:36 - 34:41)
and then yeah emblems moved cram into (34:39 - 34:43)
like an s tier yeah pokemon i mean cram (34:41 - 34:45)
just was dominant if you had if you had (34:43 - 34:47)
the all black emblem cool down like cram (34:45 - 34:51)
was unstoppable and now they've hit it (34:47 - 34:54)
hard in two areas and it's hard to say (34:51 - 34:56)
if and then they hit it hard and unite (34:54 - 34:57)
because some people would argue that (34:56 - 35:00)
kram's unite was one of the best (34:57 - 35:02)
and now it doesn't even have like this (35:00 - 35:04)
amazing unite move anymore (35:02 - 35:07)
yeah like they hit that character hard (35:04 - 35:09)
or hard and they will probably (35:07 - 35:11)
fix it (35:09 - 35:13)
in the next patch (35:11 - 35:14)
because they i mean they just hit (35:13 - 35:17)
everything hard and be like okay we're (35:14 - 35:19)
changing everything and see what happens (35:17 - 35:20)
um (35:19 - 35:24)
so i don't know like (35:20 - 35:24)
it depends on when the next changes come (35:25 - 35:29)
it also depends on what happens with (35:26 - 35:31)
dodrio who is (35:29 - 35:34)
a wild character coming and sizer which (35:31 - 35:36)
also looks like a wild character (35:34 - 35:39)
as far as like damage and things that (35:36 - 35:41)
they do so (35:39 - 35:41)
yeah i'm excited for the game but also (35:43 - 35:47)
like (35:45 - 35:49)
in a little bit of steve's exhaustion (35:47 - 35:52)
like i don't want to learn everything (35:49 - 35:54)
but (35:52 - 35:56)
i feel like i get less frustrated (35:54 - 35:58)
because i feel like everybody's learning (35:56 - 36:00)
something so i can't get too mad at (35:58 - 36:02)
people because (36:00 - 36:04)
we don't know what to do anymore (36:02 - 36:06)
and so when somebody doesn't know what (36:04 - 36:07)
to do about that's valid i don't know (36:06 - 36:08)
what to do and i've been playing this (36:07 - 36:10)
game heavily for a year i don't know (36:08 - 36:13)
what's right (36:10 - 36:13)
uh you can you can still log in and get (36:13 - 36:18)
your five free license and five free (36:15 - 36:20)
hollower gifts so um if you haven't (36:18 - 36:23)
logged in in like the last six months uh (36:20 - 36:25)
logging in day one will give you uh (36:23 - 36:27)
pikachu for free and then uh pikachu (36:25 - 36:28)
skin (36:27 - 36:30)
uh day two will give you lucario for (36:28 - 36:32)
free day three blastoise day four (36:30 - 36:34)
snorlax day five sylveon and they all (36:32 - 36:36)
come with skins so literally all you (36:34 - 36:39)
have to do log in claim the skin (36:36 - 36:42)
and that goes until october 12th so (36:39 - 36:43)
they're they're (36:42 - 36:45)
still (36:43 - 36:45)
i mean the (36:46 - 36:48)
the one-year anniversary definitely i (36:49 - 36:53)
felt like (36:51 - 36:56)
satisfied ongoing players (36:53 - 37:00)
um but them extending all of this after (36:56 - 37:02)
a huge update is like they're (37:00 - 37:03)
they know what they're doing they they (37:02 - 37:06)
want to they want to bring people back (37:03 - 37:06)
um (37:09 - 37:13)
and mew is incredibly popular so what (37:10 - 37:14)
better pokemon (37:13 - 37:18)
than than you (37:14 - 37:18)
yeah maybe i'll give it a chance you (37:18 - 37:21)
guys will play on switch though right (37:19 - 37:24)
because it's it's still on (37:21 - 37:25)
everybody plays (37:24 - 37:28)
in the same map mobile or switch so yeah (37:25 - 37:30)
there's crossbar they're not they're not (37:28 - 37:32)
divided up so if you're on mobile you (37:30 - 37:34)
can play with anybody who's on switch (37:32 - 37:35)
but it's easier to play with an actual (37:34 - 37:36)
controller right than it is like (37:35 - 37:39)
characters i think so okay (37:36 - 37:41)
uh other people disagree (37:39 - 37:43)
um i can't play on mobile at all i find (37:41 - 37:44)
it too frustrating (37:43 - 37:47)
uh yeah i i could see you how some (37:44 - 37:51)
pokemon would be very good on mobile um (37:47 - 37:53)
like like crime rants dive would (37:51 - 37:55)
probably be better on mobile because you (37:53 - 37:57)
don't have to because you could just (37:55 - 37:59)
point where to dive to (37:57 - 38:01)
instead of like dragging the cursor (37:59 - 38:03)
um (38:01 - 38:03)
but but yeah i i also find it easier (38:04 - 38:08)
with the controller but this this might (38:06 - 38:09)
go back to that like silly splatoon (38:08 - 38:11)
argument where some people are like the (38:09 - 38:13)
motion controls is the only way to play (38:11 - 38:14)
splatoon and it's like you're out of (38:13 - 38:16)
your mind i don't want to twist my (38:14 - 38:19)
controller (38:16 - 38:19)
um all right let's take a break uh when (38:21 - 38:25)
we come back we have uh (38:23 - 38:26)
some (38:25 - 38:29)
more pokemon news so we will be right (38:26 - 38:35)
back and we are back from our break (38:29 - 38:35)
um (38:35 - 38:38)
this is off uh pokey beach actually (38:38 - 38:42)
bobby sent this on and (38:40 - 38:43)
uh (38:42 - 38:45)
apparently shiny eternitis will be (38:43 - 38:48)
arriving at gamestop (38:45 - 38:50)
um in the upcoming weeks it looks like (38:48 - 38:52)
from (38:50 - 38:55)
there they're saying so who who actually (38:52 - 38:57)
knows if these dates are final or (38:55 - 38:59)
if gamestop even gets code cards or what (38:57 - 39:01)
is actually happening but uh they're (38:59 - 39:03)
saying from september 18th through (39:01 - 39:05)
october 1st (39:03 - 39:07)
uh you will be able to get shiny (39:05 - 39:10)
eternities in pokemon sword and shield (39:07 - 39:12)
for whatever reason pokey beach says you (39:10 - 39:15)
can't get it in arceus or bdsp i don't (39:12 - 39:17)
know why anyone would think you would (39:15 - 39:18)
yeah (39:17 - 39:20)
that is the wildest statement (39:18 - 39:22)
but okay (39:20 - 39:24)
um (39:22 - 39:28)
so uh yeah this is i guess not really a (39:24 - 39:31)
surprise uh because they they've (39:28 - 39:32)
usually at the end of the generation (39:31 - 39:34)
released (39:32 - 39:37)
shiny legends of some sort yeah (39:34 - 39:38)
i guess the surprise would be it's not (39:37 - 39:41)
closer to the (39:38 - 39:44)
um release of scarlet and violet (39:41 - 39:46)
we have it too close because you want to (39:44 - 39:47)
run around to the game and play with it (39:46 - 39:49)
for a while until you're sick of it yeah (39:47 - 39:51)
yeah you know that's true uh i maybe (39:49 - 39:53)
maybe they think (39:51 - 39:55)
pre-orders are down so they gotta you (39:53 - 39:58)
know boost it up you know go i mean this (39:55 - 39:59)
is the thing right like you go into (39:58 - 40:01)
gamestop to get your code and they're (39:59 - 40:03)
gonna they're gonna try to convince you (40:01 - 40:06)
to put your five dollars down (40:03 - 40:09)
and what do we say to that (40:06 - 40:09)
no (40:10 - 40:12)
i say this every time there's a (40:12 - 40:15)
distribution at gamestop i will say it (40:14 - 40:18)
again (40:15 - 40:19)
gamestop (40:18 - 40:20)
can not (40:19 - 40:22)
although they might try (40:20 - 40:23)
but they (40:22 - 40:25)
cannot charge you (40:23 - 40:29)
for this code if they are saying you (40:25 - 40:32)
have to pre-order in order to get it (40:29 - 40:34)
that is wrong (40:32 - 40:37)
that is not part of what this is (40:34 - 40:42)
uh and that gamestop (40:37 - 40:42)
should put itself out of business at (40:42 - 40:46)
that point um (40:44 - 40:49)
there there is there is no charge (40:46 - 40:52)
now there was debate last time because (40:49 - 40:55)
at least when i worked at gamestop (40:52 - 40:57)
if you didn't actually have the physical (40:55 - 40:59)
code cards you could print them out on a (40:57 - 41:01)
receipt you just went into the system (40:59 - 41:02)
and you could just like print them out (41:01 - 41:04)
you could like print as many as you (41:02 - 41:06)
wanted and i i've been told that (41:04 - 41:08)
sometimes that doesn't work anymore (41:06 - 41:10)
and i'm not 100 sure why or what (41:08 - 41:12)
happened there (41:10 - 41:14)
uh but i know with like the growlithe (41:12 - 41:16)
for legends arceus (41:14 - 41:18)
they couldn't do the receipt thing (41:16 - 41:21)
and the code cards were delayed (41:18 - 41:23)
not that that was like a really sought (41:21 - 41:25)
after distribution so i'm not 100 sure (41:23 - 41:27)
on the receipt thing (41:25 - 41:29)
but also not 100 sure if the code cards (41:27 - 41:31)
are gonna get delayed (41:29 - 41:32)
also (41:31 - 41:34)
there are code cards at all yeah i don't (41:32 - 41:37)
know anything really but (41:34 - 41:38)
um (41:37 - 41:40)
it's the beginning of september so we (41:38 - 41:43)
will update you as as that goes along of (41:40 - 41:45)
whether you should get your eternities (41:43 - 41:47)
or not (41:45 - 41:51)
um but yeah maybe maybe closer to the (41:47 - 41:52)
end of (41:51 - 41:53)
sword and shield and right before (41:52 - 41:56)
scarlet and violet they'll do calorics (41:53 - 41:57)
or (41:56 - 42:01)
urshifu or maybe somebody else but (41:57 - 42:03)
hey they hate eternitis (42:01 - 42:05)
i am a little surprised not surprised i (42:03 - 42:07)
guess but i kind of compare the (42:05 - 42:09)
turnitins and galler to (42:07 - 42:12)
like necrozma and (42:09 - 42:15)
alola and like when they did that shiny (42:12 - 42:18)
they only did it in japan for (42:15 - 42:20)
actually ever right i don't think i (42:18 - 42:21)
think they only did it for secret club (42:20 - 42:23)
for the giveaway i mean you can get it (42:21 - 42:25)
now with the dynamaxx adventures but (42:23 - 42:26)
yeah as far as the giveaway it never (42:25 - 42:29)
came to uh (42:26 - 42:31)
america it was only a secret club in (42:29 - 42:34)
japan yeah so it is cool that we're (42:31 - 42:35)
getting this (42:34 - 42:38)
my third legendary of the original uh (42:35 - 42:40)
sword and shield uh the third round (42:38 - 42:43)
which is a dragon skeleton yeah yeah do (42:40 - 42:46)
we know what the third dog is (42:43 - 42:46)
here's the question though (42:46 - 42:50)
are they gonna get in the uk so that i (42:49 - 42:52)
can use the website which is how i get (42:50 - 42:54)
all my codes now and not have to go to (42:52 - 42:55)
the gamestop because that's a much (42:54 - 42:58)
better experience for me (42:55 - 42:59)
yeah i don't know (42:58 - 43:01)
i i like i hate (42:59 - 43:04)
uk i hate saying that gamestop is the (43:01 - 43:06)
preferred way of getting it because the (43:04 - 43:09)
newsletter is a nightmare (43:06 - 43:12)
the amount of people that just never get (43:09 - 43:14)
the email from the newsletter and the (43:12 - 43:16)
the pokemon customer support is like (43:14 - 43:18)
make sure you have this thing checked on (43:16 - 43:20)
and it's like i've had it checked on it (43:18 - 43:21)
is checked (43:20 - 43:22)
like i literally just got your eight (43:21 - 43:25)
emails last week why did i not get this (43:22 - 43:27)
one with the w what was it the roots the (43:25 - 43:30)
root of the last for you yeah yeah i'm (43:27 - 43:32)
bitter about 2018 (43:30 - 43:34)
i never got my heatran or reggie gigas (43:32 - 43:36)
like year of legendaries (43:34 - 43:39)
uh let newsletter and no one has been (43:36 - 43:40)
able to trade me one because apparently (43:39 - 43:41)
like (43:40 - 43:43)
no one got that newsletter and that was (43:41 - 43:46)
the only way to redeem them back in 2018 (43:43 - 43:51)
is the worst the worst frustrating thing (43:46 - 43:51)
uh (43:51 - 43:54)
i was going to do a transition about (43:55 - 43:58)
frustrating but i i i don't have a good (43:56 - 44:00)
one uh griffith eye (43:58 - 44:02)
makes its mark (44:00 - 44:03)
yes (44:02 - 44:06)
uh meet the toxic monkey pokemon (44:03 - 44:08)
originally discovered in the paldea (44:06 - 44:10)
region (44:08 - 44:10)
and they had like a (44:12 - 44:18)
short 45 second video (44:15 - 44:19)
which (44:18 - 44:21)
we've come a long way since the 24 (44:19 - 44:25)
24-hour uh ponyta stream where then also (44:21 - 44:26)
the pony talk came on stream and it was (44:25 - 44:28)
missing itself so (44:26 - 44:29)
researchers have come a long way because (44:28 - 44:31)
they're now leaving cameras out so they (44:29 - 44:33)
don't get killed in their missions like (44:31 - 44:35)
every other video so far this person's (44:33 - 44:37)
like nah i don't know what this is i'm (44:35 - 44:38)
gonna leave cameras out the thing can (44:37 - 44:40)
kill the camera and i will still be (44:38 - 44:41)
alive (44:40 - 44:44)
mm-hmm i saw that zoroark video and (44:41 - 44:45)
we're like (44:44 - 44:48)
not happening (44:45 - 44:48)
um it is a poison normal type pokemon (44:49 - 44:57)
first ever weighs 60 pounds weighs uh uh (44:52 - 44:59)
two feet four inches in freedom units (44:57 - 45:02)
has the ability unburden and poison (44:59 - 45:04)
touch (45:02 - 45:06)
i think unburden would be good if it has (45:04 - 45:08)
like belch (45:06 - 45:10)
um or whatever move would consume a (45:08 - 45:12)
berry (45:10 - 45:14)
i would assume that it would probably (45:12 - 45:15)
get belch (45:14 - 45:17)
uh it says graphite eye is nocturnal (45:15 - 45:19)
once the sun's set it licks its hands (45:17 - 45:21)
and fingers to cover them in poison then (45:19 - 45:24)
it then it uses them to draw patterns on (45:21 - 45:26)
the trees and its territory its (45:24 - 45:28)
poisonous saliva is used to paint (45:26 - 45:31)
uses to paint paralyzes bug pokemon (45:28 - 45:33)
which are drawn to the saliva's sweet (45:31 - 45:34)
fragrant scent (45:33 - 45:37)
when drawn when drawn when dawn draws (45:34 - 45:40)
wow there's a lot of daws there when (45:37 - 45:43)
dawn draws near graphite i (45:40 - 45:46)
goes to collect any in uh incapitated (45:43 - 45:48)
prey (45:46 - 45:50)
this pokemon specializes (45:48 - 45:52)
incapacitated sorry uh this pokemon (45:50 - 45:54)
specializes in using its poisonous (45:52 - 45:57)
saliva which changes colors depending on (45:54 - 45:59)
what the pokemon eats to attack foes by (45:57 - 46:02)
spitting at them or slashing at them (45:59 - 46:04)
with its coating uh on its claws with (46:02 - 46:07)
saliva when graffiti eye senses danger (46:04 - 46:10)
its poison rapidly rapidly rapidly (46:07 - 46:12)
becomes concentrated resulting in a (46:10 - 46:16)
potent toxin once absorbed that will (46:12 - 46:19)
immobilize a victim for three whole days (46:16 - 46:20)
do they think it's gonna learn to move (46:19 - 46:23)
toxic or are they gonna skip it (46:20 - 46:24)
uh (46:23 - 46:26)
i don't (46:24 - 46:27)
it's always they always make poison (46:26 - 46:31)
pokemon seem so deadly like is it like (46:27 - 46:33)
garbodor is like (46:31 - 46:35)
no human can stand around it because it (46:33 - 46:38)
stenches so bad (46:35 - 46:40)
and then you just see ash (46:38 - 46:41)
around like eight of them and it's like (46:40 - 46:44)
oh it's fine that's fine look ash has (46:41 - 46:46)
lost all senses because he's been (46:44 - 46:48)
electrocuted so many times he can't (46:46 - 46:52)
smell hear or taste much anymore (46:48 - 46:52)
um (46:54 - 46:57)
i am i hope that (46:55 - 47:01)
the graffiti doesn't mean that smeargle (46:57 - 47:04)
is kept away from miranda's gone forever (47:01 - 47:06)
that's what it seems like how many i (47:04 - 47:08)
mean how many people i don't (47:06 - 47:10)
are you insinuating are you suggesting (47:08 - 47:14)
that graffiti i would get like sketch (47:10 - 47:15)
no i just (47:14 - 47:20)
am seeing a pokemon who follows like the (47:15 - 47:21)
the theme of another very popular (47:20 - 47:24)
pokemon and and thinking (47:21 - 47:26)
do they want to not (47:24 - 47:27)
do you want to zero in on that with a (47:26 - 47:29)
new pokemon and not have (47:27 - 47:32)
uh this other you know have smeargle who (47:29 - 47:34)
just because of the not like anything (47:32 - 47:36)
that he actually does in the game more (47:34 - 47:39)
so just the idea of smeargle being this (47:36 - 47:41)
pokemon that paints and graphite i also (47:39 - 47:43)
having that same (47:41 - 47:47)
oh i said i see theme to him so (47:43 - 47:47)
i don't know yeah i don't know obviously (47:48 - 47:53)
like (47:50 - 47:54)
the (47:53 - 47:57)
the dex cut (47:54 - 47:59)
the the great decks cut of well i don't (47:57 - 48:01)
know what year that was when they (47:59 - 48:02)
announced certain (48:01 - 48:07)
2017 or something 2018 2018 yeah um (48:02 - 48:10)
19. (48:07 - 48:12)
we we have so many pokemon with like (48:10 - 48:15)
weird gimmicks that they're able to (48:12 - 48:18)
now that the the dex cut is a thing they (48:15 - 48:20)
can like keep those gimmicks to specific (48:18 - 48:23)
games like i think unknown did fit (48:20 - 48:26)
really well in legends arceus because (48:23 - 48:29)
legends arceus isn't a competitive (48:26 - 48:31)
game and also there's not that many (48:29 - 48:35)
battles in that game at all and like (48:31 - 48:37)
it hidden like it they they did cut (48:35 - 48:39)
hidden power from sword and shield they (48:37 - 48:41)
got rid of that move completely and then (48:39 - 48:42)
it was like well that's the only move (48:41 - 48:44)
unknown learned so what happens if (48:42 - 48:45)
unknown comes back in the future and (48:44 - 48:47)
they're like we did it we made unknown (48:45 - 48:49)
come back in this game where battling (48:47 - 48:51)
doesn't really matter and hidden power (48:49 - 48:54)
does this very specific thing now and it (48:51 - 48:55)
still doesn't matter because this game (48:54 - 48:58)
isn't competitive like (48:55 - 49:00)
we we were thinking for the longest time (48:58 - 49:01)
was like how are they going to just keep (49:00 - 49:03)
making fur fruit work they're going to (49:01 - 49:05)
have to have a salon in every single (49:03 - 49:07)
game to make fur for work now they can (49:05 - 49:08)
just be like you know what perfect in (49:07 - 49:10)
this game we'll see you in a couple (49:08 - 49:11)
years (49:10 - 49:14)
uh i think smeargle is that pokemon as (49:11 - 49:16)
well (49:14 - 49:18)
like sketch (49:16 - 49:21)
was a nightmare for competitive and they (49:18 - 49:24)
literally had to ban dark void (49:21 - 49:27)
because why would you not sketch dark (49:24 - 49:29)
void and whatever else (49:27 - 49:31)
um (49:29 - 49:34)
i don't think if i i was like there to (49:31 - 49:37)
like fill in the the the (49:34 - 49:40)
the role of smeargle i think (49:37 - 49:42)
like it (49:40 - 49:45)
i think i think it's different enough (49:42 - 49:48)
but i do but i am worried about like (49:45 - 49:49)
are they going to bring this miracle (49:48 - 49:50)
back (49:49 - 49:52)
because if they if they're not going to (49:50 - 49:53)
bring spirit go back it's probably (49:52 - 49:56)
because competitive reasons (49:53 - 49:56)
we know bret loom is coming back though (49:56 - 50:00)
and bret loom has access to spore (49:58 - 50:03)
yeah (50:00 - 50:05)
um (50:03 - 50:05)
and we know that smeargle was also one (50:06 - 50:10)
of the best fall swipers (50:07 - 50:11)
because like what was everyone using in (50:10 - 50:14)
sun and moon or x and y or omega ruby it (50:11 - 50:15)
was usually like smeargle with false (50:14 - 50:18)
swipe and spore and what were the other (50:15 - 50:20)
two i don't even remember soak (50:18 - 50:21)
so (50:20 - 50:22)
and (50:21 - 50:25)
depending on the last one you could use (50:22 - 50:27)
um (50:25 - 50:31)
gastro acids sometimes or (50:27 - 50:31)
uh (50:32 - 50:35)
was the other (50:32 - 50:35)
i can't even remember what moves are on (50:35 - 50:39)
mine i still haven't but there was not a (50:37 - 50:40)
single pokemon in sword and shield that (50:39 - 50:42)
learned both (50:40 - 50:44)
false swipe and spore (50:42 - 50:46)
there was like glade which was like (50:44 - 50:49)
false swiping hypnosis (50:46 - 50:51)
but (50:49 - 50:52)
like there was no way that was like an (50:51 - 50:54)
oversight that was like that felt very (50:52 - 50:57)
intentional (50:54 - 50:57)
uh i like the design of graffiti eye (51:03 - 51:07)
it's ugly cute (51:06 - 51:12)
yeah exactly yep ugly cute is perfect (51:07 - 51:12)
it feels very um (51:14 - 51:19)
like trying to get like the cool kids (51:17 - 51:21)
back (51:19 - 51:23)
like very like edge lord i'm still (51:21 - 51:26)
shopping at hot topic kind of thing (51:23 - 51:28)
there are going to be a lot of hot topic (51:26 - 51:31)
graphite t-shirts you know (51:28 - 51:32)
and there's going to be a lot of fan (51:31 - 51:34)
articles (51:32 - 51:36)
with a chain wallet just give it time (51:34 - 51:38)
especially after this podcast i wonder (51:36 - 51:40)
if you think this pokemon's going to (51:38 - 51:41)
evolve or not or do you think this is (51:40 - 51:44)
like a kamala smeargle kecleon situation (51:41 - 51:46)
where it's just like feeling is this is (51:44 - 51:49)
just it right like this is it (51:46 - 51:52)
it's just a one-and-done (51:49 - 51:52)
yeah i have no basis for that feeling (51:52 - 51:57)
other than that's what i feel no it feel (51:54 - 51:59)
it for whatever reason it feels like (51:57 - 52:01)
that to me as well i i don't see it (51:59 - 52:02)
having (52:01 - 52:03)
uh (52:02 - 52:07)
an evolution i i think that it (52:03 - 52:08)
yeah i guess i don't know what it is (52:07 - 52:10)
either about it but something something (52:08 - 52:11)
about the way it's presented just feels (52:10 - 52:14)
like it's not going to evolve (52:11 - 52:17)
yeah i i got that that same energy too (52:14 - 52:19)
it makes sense now that why uh there's (52:17 - 52:21)
like um (52:19 - 52:23)
there's like a spray paint graffiti (52:21 - 52:24)
character (52:23 - 52:26)
that they showed like a trainer model (52:24 - 52:28)
so assuming that that pokemon has (52:26 - 52:29)
graphite eye (52:28 - 52:31)
um or even like (52:29 - 52:34)
maybe another shot in the dark is (52:31 - 52:37)
there's another maybe graffiti pokemon (52:34 - 52:39)
that conflicts with graphite eye (52:37 - 52:41)
they (52:39 - 52:43)
i feel like game freak can't just make (52:41 - 52:45)
one monkey (52:43 - 52:47)
they're like we need a minimum of two (52:45 - 52:50)
monkeys at all there's always more (52:47 - 52:52)
monkeys mm-hmm so i wonder if there (52:50 - 52:55)
would be like another graffiti pokemon (52:52 - 52:56)
monkey or not that competes with the (52:55 - 52:59)
griffith eye for for territory or (52:56 - 53:03)
because it okay so my my thing too is (52:59 - 53:05)
like yeah they show all that paint but (53:03 - 53:06)
when in the video they show him like (53:05 - 53:09)
painting over the paint in like circles (53:06 - 53:11)
so is somebody else laying down the (53:09 - 53:12)
stripes (53:11 - 53:14)
and then graphite is painting over it (53:12 - 53:17)
with circles (53:14 - 53:17)
i mean this they showed the (53:17 - 53:22)
uh what bug was it that they showed (53:20 - 53:26)
scatterbug scatterbug being attracted to (53:22 - 53:29)
the stripes which is (53:26 - 53:30)
goes with the (53:29 - 53:34)
story which is the story of its thing so (53:30 - 53:36)
i i think they were just (53:34 - 53:38)
showing like oh it's laid down these (53:36 - 53:39)
stripes and it comes in and paints more (53:38 - 53:41)
because they wanted to show off its (53:39 - 53:44)
painting yeah but like the scatter bug (53:41 - 53:46)
was doing what the (53:44 - 53:49)
story says they draw it to attract bugs (53:46 - 53:52)
right right (53:49 - 53:54)
um i do wonder if so (53:52 - 53:56)
to me (53:54 - 53:58)
graphite eye looks (53:56 - 54:01)
i would say like it looks futuristic a (53:58 - 54:02)
little bit like is a little bit more (54:01 - 54:04)
modern (54:02 - 54:07)
and i wonder if they would have some (54:04 - 54:08)
past (54:07 - 54:11)
themed pokemon that would be (54:08 - 54:14)
opposite of graphite (54:11 - 54:14)
i could see that its eyes look very (54:14 - 54:18)
futuristic yeah (54:16 - 54:21)
yeah it looks yeah very (54:18 - 54:23)
modern or futuristic with uh almost (54:21 - 54:25)
looks like it has (54:23 - 54:26)
like a (54:25 - 54:29)
vr headset on i mean it's not it's (54:26 - 54:30)
always eyes look but it just kind of (54:29 - 54:33)
looks a little bit like that (54:30 - 54:33)
it is awesome to say like the painted (54:34 - 54:40)
forest is a thing that exists (54:37 - 54:41)
um (54:40 - 54:44)
so the painted forest of oma which i (54:41 - 54:47)
believe is in spain so like (54:44 - 54:48)
the trees (54:47 - 54:51)
are based off of that (54:48 - 54:54)
forest so like it's interesting that (54:51 - 54:56)
they're sort of incorporating pokemon (54:54 - 54:59)
into that instead of (54:56 - 55:01)
uh the actual (54:59 - 55:03)
sculptor painter who did it in real life (55:01 - 55:04)
obviously so it's it's kind of a nice (55:03 - 55:07)
nod to a thing that actually exists (55:04 - 55:08)
um (55:07 - 55:10)
i'll link (55:08 - 55:11)
so you can see picture i'll put it link (55:10 - 55:13)
in the chat so you can see like you can (55:11 - 55:15)
see what they based it off of right like (55:13 - 55:17)
you can look at the painted forest like (55:15 - 55:20)
oh okay this was the inspiration this is (55:17 - 55:21)
a nice touch (55:20 - 55:23)
it's a nice spanish (55:21 - 55:25)
flair to this (55:23 - 55:28)
pokemon and sort of what the forest (55:25 - 55:31)
lives in (55:28 - 55:31)
uh shifting over to a little bit of (55:34 - 55:39)
pokemon go news there was already the (55:36 - 55:41)
ink event that that came and went so (55:39 - 55:42)
we're not going to talk about that but (55:41 - 55:44)
there's a clefairy uh (55:42 - 55:46)
there's a clefairy event (55:44 - 55:48)
uh clefairy has been spotted together (55:46 - 55:50)
all over for the world all over the (55:48 - 55:53)
world in preparation for the full moon (55:50 - 55:55)
uh it seems that celebration is about to (55:53 - 55:59)
begin on the night of saturday september (55:55 - 56:01)
10th clefairy will appear more often in (55:59 - 56:04)
the wild from six to nine local time (56:01 - 56:06)
um and we can't see what you find by the (56:04 - 56:08)
moonlight (56:06 - 56:10)
i (56:08 - 56:12)
is this is this just a clefairy (56:10 - 56:13)
community day (56:12 - 56:14)
like it's (56:13 - 56:16)
they're not saying it's like field (56:14 - 56:17)
research (56:16 - 56:19)
like the ink event (56:17 - 56:21)
um (56:19 - 56:21)
i think it's cool i think it's cool to (56:23 - 56:27)
have an event at night and it goes along (56:24 - 56:28)
with the (56:27 - 56:30)
harvest moon (56:28 - 56:32)
the whole theme of that i think (56:30 - 56:34)
is the pokemon company doing something (56:32 - 56:36)
like i think they're doing other events (56:34 - 56:39)
or other things in japan (56:36 - 56:41)
with the regarding like the harvest moon (56:39 - 56:43)
so i think this is like a part of that (56:41 - 56:46)
there is a japanese weather channel that (56:43 - 56:48)
is actually going to be like dedicating (56:46 - 56:52)
an hour to the clefairy event (56:48 - 56:54)
and that japanese weather channel (56:52 - 56:55)
streams on twitch (56:54 - 56:58)
so (56:55 - 56:59)
and they certainly like youtube and (56:58 - 57:01)
stuff too so uh they're gonna be (56:59 - 57:03)
covering this event (57:01 - 57:04)
i don't know what that looks like yeah (57:03 - 57:06)
what is that just someone playing go (57:04 - 57:09)
like saying a bunch of clefairy spawn i (57:06 - 57:11)
i i imagine it would be like you know (57:09 - 57:14)
how they do like the santa tracker every (57:11 - 57:15)
year (57:14 - 57:17)
yeah (57:15 - 57:18)
that's that's what i think (57:17 - 57:20)
um (57:18 - 57:21)
it is really cool that they're doing an (57:20 - 57:23)
event at night i think that's great (57:21 - 57:25)
especially in the summer time where (57:23 - 57:25)
where (57:25 - 57:28)
you know at least in was at least in (57:25 - 57:31)
minneap minnesota the you still have (57:28 - 57:34)
daylight at like nine o'clock (57:31 - 57:35)
um (57:34 - 57:36)
i don't know about other places but (57:35 - 57:38)
that's wild to me by the way is anytime (57:36 - 57:39)
i see (57:38 - 57:41)
someone uh doing a video or streaming (57:39 - 57:44)
something outside and it's like 8 30 or (57:41 - 57:46)
9 o'clock and it looks like the middle (57:44 - 57:47)
of the day (57:46 - 57:48)
it is (57:47 - 57:49)
just (57:48 - 57:51)
so (57:49 - 57:53)
i mean i've experienced it i i was up in (57:51 - 57:55)
alaska one time and it was still light (57:53 - 57:57)
out at like 11 p.m or something and that (57:55 - 57:59)
was something but i still trips me up (57:57 - 58:02)
every single time i see that uh where (57:59 - 58:04)
it's daylight (58:02 - 58:06)
yeah i mean to be fair like the sun will (58:04 - 58:10)
be going down around 7 40 on saturday (58:06 - 58:13)
because the days are once again getting (58:10 - 58:15)
shorter (58:13 - 58:15)
so you should be able to do some of the (58:16 - 58:21)
community today while the full moon is (58:18 - 58:23)
out and you can look at said full moon (58:21 - 58:25)
provided it's not cloudy or terrible (58:23 - 58:27)
weather (58:25 - 58:29)
i guess the most thing is going to (58:27 - 58:31)
hawaii when they have exactly eight (58:29 - 58:32)
hours of daylight (58:31 - 58:35)
hours of night i'm like we had no idea (58:32 - 58:37)
what to do like this is the strangest (58:35 - 58:38)
experience of my life (58:37 - 58:40)
i guess i'm curious why they're not (58:38 - 58:43)
calling this a community (58:40 - 58:45)
because they actually have a different (58:43 - 58:46)
day for community that they haven't (58:45 - 58:49)
announced and i bet they won't have i (58:46 - 58:51)
don't think it'll be i don't think the (58:49 - 58:54)
shiny rate will be one in 25 or whatever (58:51 - 58:55)
community day numbers are so they won't (58:54 - 58:57)
probably want to keep (58:55 - 59:00)
i want to keep that out of there in case (58:57 - 59:02)
they aren't going to make the show right (59:00 - 59:04)
there you know the extra bonuses for (59:02 - 59:07)
lures and all that stuff it's just hey (59:04 - 59:09)
come out and stand yeah there is they (59:07 - 59:11)
didn't say anything about incense or (59:09 - 59:13)
lures or it's just (59:11 - 59:16)
more clefairy from 6 to 9 p.m that's it (59:13 - 59:18)
it's like an extended spotlight hour i (59:16 - 59:19)
think more than a community day right (59:18 - 59:21)
like well spotlight hours doesn't have (59:19 - 59:23)
increased ads so (59:21 - 59:24)
does this say that it'll have increased (59:23 - 59:26)
shiny odds no it'll just say clefairy (59:24 - 59:28)
could be shiny yeah i think it's just (59:26 - 59:30)
gonna be like a three hour spotlight (59:28 - 59:32)
hour (59:30 - 59:34)
spotlight hours i guess so the complaint (59:32 - 59:36)
is i played for all three hours i only (59:34 - 59:38)
got one shiny clefairy this event sucked (59:36 - 59:40)
yes we will see many tweets like that (59:38 - 59:44)
yeah yeah okay good (59:40 - 59:44)
uh there is the psychic spectacular (59:45 - 59:49)

cosmog mission to like catch psychic (61:24 - 61:29)

during this psychic event (61:44 - 61:48)
so (61:47 - 61:50)
oh yeah look out for those different (61:48 - 61:52)
colored eyes because that's kind of the (61:50 - 61:55)

also uh that is (62:13 - 62:16)
the (62:15 - 62:21)
same weekend as scarlet and violet so i (62:16 - 62:23)
not a hundred (62:21 - 62:25)
maybe they've determined that singapore (62:23 - 62:27)
players don't like switch games i don't (62:25 - 62:28)
like (62:27 - 62:31)
why is it this weekend (62:28 - 62:32)
why is it not the weekend after or the (62:31 - 62:35)
weekend before it just it's (62:32 - 62:37)
i can't imagine you know the games (62:35 - 62:41)
janine likes to play at this point (62:37 - 62:44)
janine is janine's like the thing from (62:41 - 62:47)
saw you have to decide what is your pain (62:44 - 62:48)
what is your pleasure (62:47 - 62:51)
i just cannot imagine being a huge (62:48 - 62:54)
pokemon fan living in singapore (62:51 - 62:56)
like loving the main series stuff loving (62:54 - 62:58)
go maybe you love masters as well and (62:56 - 63:00)
then being like oh it's finally coming (62:58 - 63:03)
back to singapore oh the week in a brand (63:00 - 63:05)
new game is coming out (63:03 - 63:07)
just (63:05 - 63:07)
weird weird timing (63:08 - 63:13)
they like to they just wanna (63:10 - 63:15)
i don't know i guess maybe they (63:13 - 63:17)
maybe they think there are more people (63:15 - 63:20)
who don't like all pokemon things than (63:17 - 63:23)
do so that so you kind of (63:20 - 63:26)
uh you know oh this group is excited (63:23 - 63:27)
about this thing happening now i can be (63:26 - 63:29)
excited about something pokemon related (63:27 - 63:31)
happening too at the same time (63:29 - 63:33)
yeah (63:31 - 63:33)
okay we were going to (63:38 - 63:41)
talk about this last week but we will (63:40 - 63:43)
talk about it now this will be our last (63:41 - 63:44)
news article here i'm sure i'm missing (63:43 - 63:46)
some news but i think we covered all the (63:44 - 63:48)
big stuff uh (63:46 - 63:52)
game free this is off nintendolife.com (63:48 - 63:54)
gamefreak confirms pokemon legends (63:52 - 63:57)
arceus started development before sword (63:54 - 63:59)
and shields launch (63:57 - 64:01)
now if you just read the headline (63:59 - 64:04)
you're probably like (64:01 - 64:04)
i knew it (64:05 - 64:08)
or maybe like what but (64:09 - 64:14)
like there there's a point where a game (64:12 - 64:16)
is done and then the team moves on to (64:14 - 64:19)
the next game even before it ships so (64:16 - 64:22)
it's like not this is this is at least (64:19 - 64:25)
at least this isn't surprising to me (64:22 - 64:27)
because you just don't like finish a (64:25 - 64:28)
game in september and you're like well i (64:27 - 64:32)
guess we're doing nothing until november (64:28 - 64:32)
they do have to finish the game um (64:33 - 64:38)
eventually (64:35 - 64:40)
uh game freak held a talk during the (64:38 - 64:43)
computer entertainment developers (64:40 - 64:46)
conference 2022 on august 25th the (64:43 - 64:48)
company shared a lot of information how (64:46 - 64:50)
it developed assets for every pokemon (64:48 - 64:52)
game from pokemon red and blue all the (64:50 - 64:54)
way to the most recent series pokemon's (64:52 - 64:56)
legends arceus (64:54 - 64:59)
gamefreak detailed how it used many (64:56 - 65:01)
different effects like shader fx and how (64:59 - 65:03)
it the implementation has improved over (65:01 - 65:05)
the years and during the talk the (65:03 - 65:07)
company confirmed that legends arceus (65:05 - 65:11)
started in the fall of 2018 a full year (65:07 - 65:13)
before generation 8 games pokemon sword (65:11 - 65:15)
and shield were launched (65:13 - 65:17)
the details of the talk have been shared (65:15 - 65:19)
by twitter (65:17 - 65:22)
and twitter user and youtuber (65:19 - 65:25)
uh they do a lot of um (65:22 - 65:25)
uh (65:25 - 65:27)
not translation stuff they do some (65:27 - 65:31)
translation stuff but they do like a lot (65:29 - 65:33)
of like deep dives into like pokemon (65:31 - 65:35)
history (65:33 - 65:37)
uh who is uh hoping to get their entire (65:35 - 65:38)
print (65:37 - 65:40)
presentation translated in the future (65:38 - 65:42)
uh the tibbett confirms that legends (65:40 - 65:44)
arceus was in development for three (65:42 - 65:47)
years (65:44 - 65:47)
uh pokemons legends arctis saw another (65:49 - 65:53)
number of changes to the pokemon formula (65:51 - 65:56)
with more open zones and pokemon uh out (65:53 - 65:58)
on the field as well as an option to not (65:56 - 66:00)
even battle wild pokemon (65:58 - 66:03)
uh now we're on the way to the launch of (66:00 - 66:05)
generation 9 with scarlet violet (66:03 - 66:07)
gamefreak also shared that the upcoming (66:05 - 66:10)
games started development in late 2019 (66:07 - 66:11)
around the time sword and shield was (66:10 - 66:13)
getting ready to launch by that time (66:11 - 66:15)
scarlet and violet will be in (66:13 - 66:20)
development for three years (66:15 - 66:20)
i guess maybe like the takeaway here is (66:20 - 66:25)
there (66:24 - 66:27)
there are a lot of pokemon games no (66:25 - 66:29)
doubt (66:27 - 66:29)
uh (66:30 - 66:32)
and i think a common thing you see (66:31 - 66:34)
online is like i wish game freak would (66:32 - 66:37)
take more time to make these games (66:34 - 66:42)
or i wish they would take a year off (66:37 - 66:42)
but (66:43 - 66:46)
legends was three years sword and shield (66:44 - 66:48)
we know was a three-year development (66:46 - 66:50)
cycle (66:48 - 66:52)
scarlet and violet we have now have (66:50 - 66:53)
confirmation that it was also a (66:52 - 66:56)
three-year development (66:53 - 66:56)
cycle i i i guess (66:59 - 67:06)
in the the capitalist mind of me is like (67:02 - 67:07)
what (67:06 - 67:09)
like if you give if you give a game like (67:07 - 67:11)
scarlet and violet another year is it (67:09 - 67:14)
actually gonna sell (67:11 - 67:17)
two million extra copies (67:14 - 67:18)
are the trees gonna look that much (67:17 - 67:20)
better that (67:18 - 67:23)
you're gonna like dramatically increase (67:20 - 67:26)
sales or marketing like at a certain (67:23 - 67:27)
point (67:26 - 67:30)
you're paying employees and you're (67:27 - 67:31)
putting in time and revenue for three (67:30 - 67:35)
years and you've got to ship a product (67:31 - 67:36)
and then you have to start on the next (67:35 - 67:38)
product that's just how (67:36 - 67:41)
companies work (67:38 - 67:44)
um (67:41 - 67:46)
would a would another year make that (67:44 - 67:48)
game better probably yeah (67:46 - 67:52)
more time usually yeah but like (67:48 - 67:54)
maybe (67:52 - 67:56)
that is a tough (67:54 - 67:58)
thing to say universally (67:56 - 68:01)
because more time doesn't necessarily (67:58 - 68:04)
mean something gets better (68:01 - 68:06)
more time can also get people second (68:04 - 68:09)
guessing more time can mean that (68:06 - 68:10)
people drag their feet the planning (68:09 - 68:12)
stage at the start (68:10 - 68:15)
just was protracted and nobody could (68:12 - 68:16)
make a decision because they had more (68:15 - 68:18)
time like (68:16 - 68:20)
there's no (68:18 - 68:23)
way to necessarily say (68:20 - 68:25)
i will have a better product because i (68:23 - 68:28)
had more time with it (68:25 - 68:28)
yeah i i think (68:28 - 68:33)
what it feels like at least is and you (68:31 - 68:35)
see this with uh (68:33 - 68:37)
other things as well (68:35 - 68:38)
but (68:37 - 68:40)
people who say i wish they would take (68:38 - 68:42)
time or i wish they would (68:40 - 68:44)
you know take more time or or take a (68:42 - 68:46)
year off of releasing the game (68:44 - 68:48)
i i think a lot of those people (68:46 - 68:50)
i'm not gonna say everyone definitely (68:48 - 68:51)
not everyone but i think there are a lot (68:50 - 68:53)
of people who think that the games don't (68:51 - 68:55)
take three years to develop i think that (68:53 - 68:57)
they they do think like sword and shield (68:55 - 68:59)
came out and now they're starting work (68:57 - 69:00)
on (68:59 - 69:02)
legends right and so they're saying oh i (69:00 - 69:04)
wish they would give it more than a year (69:02 - 69:05)
but (69:04 - 69:07)
in reality it's like no it's three years (69:05 - 69:09)
they've been developing it for three (69:07 - 69:10)
years so (69:09 - 69:12)
it (69:10 - 69:14)
i think there's that idea where it feels (69:12 - 69:16)
like maybe it's only been in development (69:14 - 69:17)
for (69:16 - 69:18)
a short period of time because obviously (69:17 - 69:21)
you're not hearing about it until uh (69:18 - 69:22)
you know eight months before it comes (69:21 - 69:23)
out (69:22 - 69:24)
but (69:23 - 69:26)
three years is a lot of time to be (69:24 - 69:29)
developing a game and to say an extra (69:26 - 69:31)
year would make it the better like greg (69:29 - 69:32)
said maybe (69:31 - 69:35)
but that doesn't (69:32 - 69:36)
mean that (69:35 - 69:39)
all around (69:36 - 69:39)
yeah it's uh (69:43 - 69:47)
i'm always curious what people think (69:50 - 69:54)
a good amount of time to spend (69:52 - 69:56)
developing a game is (69:54 - 69:59)
and what's your examples (69:56 - 70:02)
like what what game took x amount of (69:59 - 70:05)
time that it's the pinnacle of your (70:02 - 70:07)
gameplay (70:05 - 70:07)
breath of the wild took five years right (70:09 - 70:14)
wasn't it a five year development game (70:11 - 70:15)
yeah (70:14 - 70:17)
and i mean i would (70:15 - 70:20)
i would say people would (70:17 - 70:21)
you know (70:20 - 70:23)
whatever however people thought of you (70:21 - 70:24)
know specifics about it but i do think (70:23 - 70:26)
that there are a lot of people who (70:24 - 70:28)
thought that that game was done very (70:26 - 70:32)
well and it was a really good game (70:28 - 70:34)
uh yeah i think the wild is incredible i (70:32 - 70:36)
put 40 hours into it and then i never (70:34 - 70:38)
played it again i i (70:36 - 70:41)
i beat ganondorf i i did most of the (70:38 - 70:43)
temples (70:41 - 70:45)
i enjoyed every second i played that (70:43 - 70:46)
game but i didn't (70:45 - 70:49)
have the replayability that i (70:46 - 70:51)
found in like i have 2 000 hours in (70:49 - 70:52)
sword and shield (70:51 - 70:54)
and because like i i spent time (70:52 - 70:58)
competitive i spent time um (70:54 - 70:59)
shiny hunting i spent time completing (70:58 - 71:01)
the pokedex and (70:59 - 71:03)
could i easily get 200 hours out of (71:01 - 71:05)
breath of wild of completing every (71:03 - 71:07)
single dungeon or finding all the corox (71:05 - 71:08)
seeds (71:07 - 71:11)
yeah but like (71:08 - 71:11)
i didn't i didn't feel the need to in (71:12 - 71:16)
that game and some people did (71:14 - 71:17)
yeah (71:16 - 71:19)
i mean i put 250 hours into breath of (71:17 - 71:21)
the wild i didn't get all the coroxies i (71:19 - 71:24)
don't want to do that but (71:21 - 71:24)
no thanks um not only 900 correct seeds (71:25 - 71:30)
but i did you know complete all the (71:28 - 71:32)
temples that was (71:30 - 71:34)
that was the first maybe the first game (71:32 - 71:36)
where i didn't use (71:34 - 71:39)
any you know like guide or anything to (71:36 - 71:41)
find you know to get all of that (71:39 - 71:43)
completed temples missions (71:41 - 71:46)
um all of that so that was um something (71:43 - 71:48)
i mean i love i love that game i'm not (71:46 - 71:50)
eat but i'm not i'm not even saying that (71:48 - 71:52)
that's like (71:50 - 71:54)
for me like i think that three years (71:52 - 71:56)
that they take to to create sword and (71:54 - 71:57)
shield (71:56 - 72:00)
i was wonderful but i do feel like (71:57 - 72:01)
breath of the wild is that game where a (72:00 - 72:03)
lot of people are like that game was (72:01 - 72:06)
incredible uh and then they did take (72:03 - 72:08)
five years to make it would five years (72:06 - 72:10)
working on scarlet and violet make it (72:08 - 72:12)
that much better (72:10 - 72:14)
no that doesn't mean that but i do think (72:12 - 72:16)
people like like to point to something (72:14 - 72:19)
uh and breath of the wild is the thing a (72:16 - 72:21)
lot of people point to especially when (72:19 - 72:23)
they hear you know pokemons going open (72:21 - 72:25)
world right i mean what did they do with (72:23 - 72:26)
legends it wasn't even open world but (72:25 - 72:29)
everybody compared legends to breath of (72:26 - 72:31)
the wild right yeah and everybody's (72:29 - 72:32)
gonna compare scarlet and violet to (72:31 - 72:35)
breath of the wild even though (72:32 - 72:36)
there are other games that do the same (72:35 - 72:37)
thing (72:36 - 72:40)
um so i just think when that question is (72:37 - 72:42)
asked you know how long a development (72:40 - 72:44)
would make a game good then the (72:42 - 72:46)
comparison is going to be hey breath of (72:44 - 72:47)
the wild took five years (72:46 - 72:49)
uh and you know that's how that turned (72:47 - 72:50)
out (72:49 - 72:52)
you mean the nine years it took for (72:50 - 72:55)
cyberpunk didn't result in an amazing (72:52 - 72:59)
game when yeah we have examples of games (72:55 - 73:01)
that took forever that also (72:59 - 73:05)
were abysmal failures like it is a (73:01 - 73:08)
difficult thing to say (73:05 - 73:11)
to make those comparisons because for (73:08 - 73:13)
every pot like every one positive thing (73:11 - 73:16)
you have you can point to (73:13 - 73:18)
an equally negative experience for a (73:16 - 73:22)
game that took a lot longer (73:18 - 73:22)
like you have to sort of decide like (73:24 - 73:29)
it's okay to say the game isn't for you (73:26 - 73:31)
like but pointing at things that you (73:29 - 73:34)
don't have control over and making grand (73:31 - 73:36)
claims like if they just spent more time (73:34 - 73:38)
playing working on these games it would (73:36 - 73:40)
match my needs (73:38 - 73:42)
no (73:40 - 73:43)
they're not trying to match your (73:42 - 73:45)
specific needs (73:43 - 73:46)
right (73:45 - 73:48)
well and again i think that there are a (73:46 - 73:50)
lot of people who if you said (73:48 - 73:52)
if they said this game needed more time (73:50 - 73:53)
and you said okay well how long do you (73:52 - 73:55)
think the game took them (73:53 - 73:57)
they might not say three years they (73:55 - 73:59)
might say like oh i bet they worked on (73:57 - 74:00)
it for a year or a year and a half or (73:59 - 74:02)
two you know like three years it's like (74:00 - 74:04)
oh that might be a little bit (74:02 - 74:05)
you know i guess it turns into a (74:04 - 74:07)
different argument like well why isn't (74:05 - 74:09)
it better like whatever (74:07 - 74:10)
you know (74:09 - 74:13)
i think that there is definitely (74:10 - 74:14)
um (74:13 - 74:15)
some (74:14 - 74:17)
just people just think differently than (74:15 - 74:19)
than what really you know they they look (74:17 - 74:21)
at it based on like well nobody really (74:19 - 74:23)
was talking about this before eight (74:21 - 74:24)
months ago so it couldn't have been in (74:23 - 74:26)
development for a whole lot longer than (74:24 - 74:28)
eight months but right no it's obviously (74:26 - 74:29)
not true so (74:28 - 74:31)
how long have we been waiting for how (74:29 - 74:32)
long was the wait for that doom game (74:31 - 74:35)
that wasn't very good like 15 000 years (74:32 - 74:37)
yeah (74:35 - 74:39)
like (74:37 - 74:41)
i mean you could also i like i i i guess (74:39 - 74:43)
we could spend literally 90 minutes (74:41 - 74:45)
talking about games that were in develop (74:43 - 74:47)
like like anthem which was like the (74:45 - 74:49)
destiny killer that was a four-year (74:47 - 74:51)
development cycle and now you can walk (74:49 - 74:54)
into gamestop and buy anthem for (74:51 - 74:57)
literally 99 cents and it won't work (74:54 - 74:59)
because they shut down the servers (74:57 - 75:00)
because like i don't even think that (74:59 - 75:02)
game lasted a full year before they were (75:00 - 75:04)
like (75:02 - 75:04)
the the thing is the thing that (75:06 - 75:09)
frustrates me always about this (75:07 - 75:11)
conversation is (75:09 - 75:13)
you don't need a justification for not (75:11 - 75:16)
liking something (75:13 - 75:18)
if you don't like it (75:16 - 75:21)
you don't like it but pointing out (75:18 - 75:24)
random things to make other people who (75:21 - 75:27)
do like the thing suddenly not like it (75:24 - 75:31)
is never gonna work like you can say oh (75:27 - 75:33)
you know it would have really hit my (75:31 - 75:35)
buttons if it had taken four more years (75:33 - 75:37)
and it had been all of these things it's (75:35 - 75:39)
like it could have been that's not the (75:37 - 75:41)
game they got it's fine that you don't (75:39 - 75:43)
like this game i do (75:41 - 75:45)
cool (75:43 - 75:47)
like these conversations that happen (75:45 - 75:49)
like even like this (75:47 - 75:51)
this article itself was like c it did (75:49 - 75:54)
take three years it's like that's (75:51 - 75:57)
it it could have taken one like (75:54 - 75:59)
we got the game we got like you can have (75:57 - 76:00)
legitimate (75:59 - 76:02)
criticisms about things that they did do (76:00 - 76:04)
in the game that you think could be done (76:02 - 76:07)
better but pointing at a development (76:04 - 76:09)
cycle in a corporation that you don't (76:07 - 76:11)
control with processes you can't see and (76:09 - 76:15)
employees you can't speak to (76:11 - 76:15)
you're just farting in the wind at that (76:16 - 76:19)
point (76:18 - 76:22)
and making everybody smell it (76:19 - 76:23)
that that is twitter that is twitter's (76:22 - 76:27)
motto with the argument of um (76:23 - 76:28)
whether a game (76:27 - 76:31)
is needs more time or or it came out too (76:28 - 76:33)
soon i feel like people (76:31 - 76:35)
i feel like i hear the quote there's (76:33 - 76:38)
there's a quote by miyamoto which (76:35 - 76:40)
goes hand in hand with like zelda fans (76:38 - 76:42)
or mario fans of a delayed game is (76:40 - 76:44)
eventually good but a rushed game is bad (76:42 - 76:46)
forever (76:44 - 76:47)
and he said this in one of like this (76:46 - 76:49)
these like business talk things when (76:47 - 76:50)
back (76:49 - 76:53)
cash like in like 2012 or something 2010 (76:50 - 76:55)
2012. but like (76:53 - 76:58)
and people will use that quote and they (76:55 - 77:00)
did use it around sword and shield of (76:58 - 77:02)
like oh they should have just delayed it (77:00 - 77:03)
because like (77:02 - 77:05)
uh a delayed game is eventually good or (77:03 - 77:07)
uh a rushed game is bad forever but that (77:05 - 77:09)
like that doesn't even hold up anymore (77:07 - 77:10)
no it doesn't (77:09 - 77:13)
like that quote literally doesn't hold (77:10 - 77:15)
any water anymore because there have (77:13 - 77:18)
been games like rainbow six or final (77:15 - 77:21)
fantasy 14 or no man's sky where these (77:18 - 77:24)
games were actually terrible at launch (77:21 - 77:26)
and they fixed it (77:24 - 77:27)
oh yeah (77:26 - 77:28)
um (77:27 - 77:29)
and like (77:28 - 77:31)
like rainbow six is probably one of the (77:29 - 77:32)
biggest ones that people don't talk (77:31 - 77:34)
about but like that game was so terrible (77:32 - 77:35)
at launch (77:34 - 77:38)
and now it has one of like the best (77:35 - 77:41)
biggest most dedicated like fan bases (77:38 - 77:42)
ever and like if you're not into rainbow (77:41 - 77:44)
six you're not in rainbow six but like (77:42 - 77:46)
the people that are like (77:44 - 77:47)
they (77:46 - 77:50)
hated that game and everything about it (77:47 - 77:52)
and that team was able to like (77:50 - 77:54)
revamp rework and like restructure that (77:52 - 77:56)
entire game where now it's it is the (77:54 - 77:59)
best rainbow six game ever made (77:56 - 78:02)
they blew up the first (77:59 - 78:03)
iteration (78:02 - 78:06)
of final fantasy 14. they literally (78:03 - 78:09)
killed everybody and everybody inside of (78:06 - 78:10)
it (78:09 - 78:14)
and redid the entire game (78:10 - 78:14)
and called it a realm reborn because the (78:14 - 78:19)
first iteration was (78:16 - 78:22)
awful (78:19 - 78:22)
yeah and now final fantasy 14 is the (78:22 - 78:27)
biggest mmo (78:25 - 78:29)
out there yeah (78:27 - 78:31)
it's an incredible game (78:29 - 78:34)
um (78:31 - 78:34)
so so yeah i (78:37 - 78:41)
i thought the development cycle stuff (78:41 - 78:46)
was was interesting uh (78:43 - 78:46)
three years seems fine again i don't (78:46 - 78:51)
know if i don't know if four years is (78:49 - 78:53)
suddenly going to (78:51 - 78:55)
result in more sales or a better game or (78:53 - 78:58)
it's just interesting like people (78:55 - 78:58)
like it gives a talking point of well (78:59 - 79:04)
certain shield and legends arceus (79:01 - 79:06)
took the same amount of development time (79:04 - 79:09)
so you loved arcgis and you didn't like (79:06 - 79:10)
sword and shield so the development time (79:09 - 79:12)
isn't a factor there because they took (79:10 - 79:14)
the same amount of time it just met your (79:12 - 79:17)
gameplay expectations right (79:14 - 79:19)
right (79:17 - 79:21)
and one had 600 pokemon in the other (79:19 - 79:24)
game only had 200 pokemon well that was (79:21 - 79:26)
gonna say too is it's interesting (79:24 - 79:28)
i mean i don't know how game development (79:26 - 79:31)
works specifically so but to have them (79:28 - 79:32)
be the same (79:31 - 79:34)
amount of time i feel like sword and (79:32 - 79:36)
shield is such a bigger game i mean (79:34 - 79:37)
they're obvious it is a bigger game (79:36 - 79:39)
there's just more to sword and shield (79:37 - 79:40)
when it comes to (79:39 - 79:42)
everything but (79:40 - 79:43)
um for them to take the same amount of (79:42 - 79:46)
time kind of shows you (79:43 - 79:46)
that (79:46 - 79:48)
maybe an extra year wouldn't have made a (79:46 - 79:50)
whole lot of a difference (79:48 - 79:52)
if if those two games are taking a (79:50 - 79:53)
similar (79:52 - 79:55)
amount of time to make yeah i don't even (79:53 - 79:57)
know what you would add to legends that (79:55 - 79:59)
like would you just add trainers around (79:57 - 80:01)
the world and those trainers battled you (79:59 - 80:02)
i don't know if that just does i don't (80:01 - 80:03)
think that makes it a dramatically (80:02 - 80:06)
better game like yeah yeah trainer (80:03 - 80:08)
battles but like (80:06 - 80:08)
like i think lunges is great and i think (80:10 - 80:13)
they tried a lot of things i think some (80:12 - 80:16)
things worked some things didn't but (80:13 - 80:19)
um (80:16 - 80:20)
yeah i (80:19 - 80:24)
to me sword shield is like the the (80:20 - 80:24)
the game i keep going back to (80:25 - 80:28)
um okay well uh let's do questions no (80:29 - 80:36)
pokemon the week uh but we can uh we can (80:34 - 80:39)
question the week here (80:36 - 80:43)
it's the question of the week (80:39 - 80:43)
that was it that was a good one (80:44 - 80:50)
not all of them are magnum opuses (80:48 - 80:52)
sometimes only one part of a song is (80:50 - 80:53)
actually good (80:52 - 80:57)
as proven by tick tock (80:53 - 80:57)
i guess (80:58 - 81:01)
and listen to the whole thing you're (81:05 - 81:07)
like (81:06 - 81:11)
what am i listening to that is so true (81:07 - 81:13)
i think i finally heard that full lizzo (81:11 - 81:15)
song the other day and i was like oh i (81:13 - 81:18)
didn't i've only heard that one verse (81:15 - 81:20)
over and over again (81:18 - 81:21)
yeah i was like oh the whole song is (81:20 - 81:23)
pretty all right but like i didn't know (81:21 - 81:25)
that it's really really good it's very (81:23 - 81:27)
different than the one verse you hear (81:25 - 81:28)
though yep (81:27 - 81:30)
and there's one song that's there's a (81:28 - 81:32)
vibe kind of caught a vibe something (81:30 - 81:34)
that was big on tick tock and the whole (81:32 - 81:36)
song is just like what is happening in (81:34 - 81:38)
this thing (81:36 - 81:38)
um (81:42 - 81:44)
this is from brandon and our slack what (81:45 - 81:49)
part of the animal kingdom mammals (81:47 - 81:50)
insects birds have the best pokemon (81:49 - 81:52)
designs (81:50 - 81:55)
mammals (81:52 - 81:55)
i was gonna say birds (81:56 - 82:01)
mammals you got you got (81:58 - 82:02)
all of the elephants (82:01 - 82:05)
you have all the dogs you have all the (82:02 - 82:06)
cats (82:05 - 82:10)
you have all of them (82:06 - 82:12)
they are (82:10 - 82:14)
incredible (82:12 - 82:14)
look (82:14 - 82:16)
if it weren't for maples we wouldn't (82:14 - 82:19)
have troubish (82:16 - 82:19)
case closed (82:20 - 82:23)
did i recently see rubbish as like a cat (82:21 - 82:25)
or something (82:23 - 82:27)
steve yeah steve's probably rubbish is a (82:25 - 82:29)
cat (82:27 - 82:29)
trot fishes trout fish is a cat (82:30 - 82:34)
wow i think birds oh the birds are the (82:37 - 82:44)
the best so many good perts (82:40 - 82:45)
name one (82:44 - 82:47)
far-fetched (82:45 - 82:51)
man that's pretty good the best bird (82:47 - 82:54)
it barely flies that's the mammal (82:51 - 82:54)
uh i this this question was asked like (82:56 - 82:59)
two weeks ago on our youtube uh it's (82:58 - 83:02)
from sir faye uh if you had a chance to (82:59 - 83:03)
pick a community what would you pick to (83:02 - 83:05)
be featured i think that's a good (83:03 - 83:08)
question because like we have three four (83:05 - 83:10)
community days announced but no pokemon (83:08 - 83:12)
being listed (83:10 - 83:14)
um (83:12 - 83:16)
so yeah yeah i guess what what at this (83:14 - 83:19)
point (83:16 - 83:19)
i mean obvious choice for me october (83:19 - 83:23)
litwick (83:22 - 83:24)
i think that's like everyone's choice (83:23 - 83:25)
though i think that is what they're (83:24 - 83:26)
going through that's probably what (83:25 - 83:28)
they're going to do based on some of (83:26 - 83:30)
them say that every year and it never (83:28 - 83:31)
happens yeah i know i mean they're (83:30 - 83:34)
saying it will eventually be right they (83:31 - 83:35)
do (83:34 - 83:37)
miss the halloween themed pokemon (83:35 - 83:39)
sometimes though on the october (83:37 - 83:41)
community days so (83:39 - 83:42)
i guess they could (83:41 - 83:46)
miss it again but (83:42 - 83:46)
i don't know which liquid liquid is such (83:49 - 83:53)
a good shame (83:51 - 83:55)
uh yeah i mean definitely it definitely (83:53 - 83:56)
does i (83:55 - 83:59)
i feel i feel like we're we're at this (83:56 - 84:00)
part where we're running out of pokemon (83:59 - 84:02)
to feature i mean they could feature (84:00 - 84:04)
something that's already been shiny but (84:02 - 84:06)
i don't think like a golden community (84:04 - 84:08)
would go over well (84:06 - 84:08)
although people were oddly excited to do (84:09 - 84:12)
it (84:11 - 84:14)
people were oddly excited for weedle (84:12 - 84:16)
community day so i don't know (84:14 - 84:17)
you know what would probably do (84:16 - 84:21)
incredibly well an unknown community (84:17 - 84:22)
but they would never do that because (84:21 - 84:23)
they they use that (84:22 - 84:26)
yeah they're gonna lure you in i i like (84:23 - 84:29)
the way they use unknown but well i like (84:26 - 84:31)
unknown at events i don't like them (84:29 - 84:33)
putting unknown into raids being like (84:31 - 84:36)
here's a dollar for a letter (84:33 - 84:37)
good luck (84:36 - 84:40)
have we had a cubone community today (84:37 - 84:42)
we have (84:40 - 84:45)
no that would be good i want at i want (84:42 - 84:48)
for this year to be a cuban community (84:45 - 84:51)
that can evolve into (84:48 - 84:52)
either (84:51 - 84:54)
regular marowak or (84:52 - 84:56)
a lowland marowak (84:54 - 84:59)
we did have a cube on a vent though (84:56 - 85:02)
or was it not a community today it was (84:59 - 85:04)
on a community day but you could evolve (85:02 - 85:05)
it into a low in marowak during that (85:04 - 85:06)
period of time (85:05 - 85:09)
and i did (85:06 - 85:09)
are we missing any of the starters yet (85:10 - 85:15)
yeah where are we at where are we (85:12 - 85:17)
gen five yeah yeah we need fennek and (85:15 - 85:19)
just been uh froakie (85:17 - 85:22)
yeah um i think p dove would be good (85:19 - 85:25)
i know pdf could be is has been shiny (85:22 - 85:26)
for a while but because there's like two (85:25 - 85:29)
different unpheasants (85:26 - 85:31)
um like yeah you could find one random (85:29 - 85:33)
pied of but like what if you find two (85:31 - 85:34)
and they're both male it's like i don't (85:33 - 85:37)
have the other one fuzzy now (85:34 - 85:39)
how about a buddhu community today they (85:37 - 85:41)
haven't done that yet yeah (85:39 - 85:45)
a sea bottle would be a good one (85:41 - 85:45)
sea water sea water swab loon lavani (85:45 - 85:50)
lavanni lavonnie (85:48 - 85:51)
i think rock and roll would be a good (85:50 - 85:53)
one gigalith has a really good shiny all (85:51 - 85:57)
three of them have really good shiny (85:53 - 85:57)
uh flub (85:59 - 86:04)
probably but that's like yeah dude (86:01 - 86:05)
they got like (86:04 - 86:08)
flowers spawning everywhere i don't (86:05 - 86:09)
think would that be that bad though (86:08 - 86:11)
because like (86:09 - 86:14)
what america gets what like orange (86:11 - 86:16)
white and yellow (86:14 - 86:19)
and then like europe gets like red (86:16 - 86:24)
orange and white and then asia gets blue (86:19 - 86:25)
white (86:24 - 86:26)
and something else (86:25 - 86:27)
like (86:26 - 86:30)
have we had a (86:27 - 86:30)
venery community day we just had an (86:32 - 86:35)
event (86:34 - 86:37)
um (86:35 - 86:39)
haven't we had a shallowest community (86:37 - 86:40)
today (86:39 - 86:42)
no shell loss (86:40 - 86:44)
it can't even be shiny yet i don't think (86:42 - 86:47)
right yeah no shells can't be shiny yet (86:44 - 86:49)
how we (86:47 - 86:49)
how don't (86:50 - 86:52)
a wedding a birthday community would be (86:50 - 86:56)
okay that would be cool and and as a and (86:52 - 87:00)
in in one star raids naked burme (86:56 - 87:02)
this is what they do for halloween they (87:00 - 87:05)
scrap hear me out no litwick (87:02 - 87:07)
gone get rid of it (87:05 - 87:10)
they just introduced impedimp (87:07 - 87:11)
for halloween (87:10 - 87:15)
boom babies on community (87:11 - 87:15)
i do it i mean yes i'll take it yeah (87:16 - 87:21)
totally (87:20 - 87:23)
100 percent have they done that where i (87:21 - 87:25)
put yeah they did do that didn't they (87:23 - 87:26)
where a pokemon debut community it was (87:25 - 87:28)
stufful stuff (87:26 - 87:30)
yeah and that was a great community day (87:28 - 87:32)
that was a really good one that and to (87:30 - 87:33)
be fair that was the first one where (87:32 - 87:35)
they went back from six to three hours (87:33 - 87:37)
so they were like really trying to win (87:35 - 87:38)
us over on that one (87:37 - 87:41)
but that community was really good (87:38 - 87:44)
it was what if they did like a fossil (87:41 - 87:47)
community today for the new fossils (87:44 - 87:49)
that would be sweet (87:47 - 87:50)
i don't know how they're going to do (87:49 - 87:52)
this and the one star raids are the two (87:50 - 87:54)
parts that you have to combine together (87:52 - 87:57)
to get the fossil (87:54 - 87:57)
i think pokemon go did the best (87:58 - 88:03)
version of ink (88:01 - 88:05)
because when you rotate your iphone (88:03 - 88:09)
upside down it like it changes to evolve (88:05 - 88:11)
and then it's like readable and it's (88:09 - 88:12)
really (88:11 - 88:15)
like fluid and great and like because i (88:12 - 88:17)
don't think with the switch there's any (88:15 - 88:19)
signification like switch or 3ds you (88:17 - 88:21)
just turn it upside down and then like (88:19 - 88:23)
hope it works create it (88:21 - 88:24)
yeah (88:23 - 88:27)
but the but pokemon go did (88:24 - 88:30)
really really well (88:27 - 88:30)
have we had a blitzel community today no (88:33 - 88:37)
that's all featured for something (88:38 - 88:44)
yeah i had the um head costume and that (88:40 - 88:46)
was when it could first be shiny (88:44 - 88:48)
uh it's like a bow tie or something i've (88:46 - 88:51)
got the ultimate one (88:48 - 88:53)
basculin community today and it can (88:51 - 88:57)
evolve into vascular legion oh (88:53 - 89:01)
perfect i'd be okay with that (88:57 - 89:01)
now vasculation is gonna be something (89:01 - 89:05)
like (89:03 - 89:07)
put your baskel in the gym and get it (89:05 - 89:11)
knocked out 40 times (89:07 - 89:11)
oh yeah maybe like it'll be you can only (89:13 - 89:18)
evolve a masculine that is that doesn't (89:15 - 89:19)
have any health (89:18 - 89:21)
or something like it has to have no (89:19 - 89:22)
health in order to evolve but into (89:21 - 89:24)
vascular region yeah something like that (89:22 - 89:26)
yeah there's still a lot of pokemon they (89:24 - 89:28)
could do but (89:26 - 89:28)
i mean (89:29 - 89:31)
they have they have done pokemon that (89:29 - 89:33)
have existed as shiny before like like (89:31 - 89:35)
geodude as the community so some people (89:33 - 89:37)
like that some people don't it's (89:35 - 89:40)
whatever yeah um we'll definitely get (89:37 - 89:42)
the kayla starters i think starting (89:40 - 89:44)
at some point i i feel like next do you (89:42 - 89:45)
think we're getting them this year i (89:44 - 89:48)
think we're getting them next year right (89:45 - 89:48)
i think maybe one of them we only really (89:49 - 89:53)
have september october november left (89:51 - 89:56)
because december almost is always the (89:53 - 89:57)
ketchup (89:56 - 89:59)
everything (89:57 - 90:01)
right that's true (89:59 - 90:03)
i would say we get at least one calo (90:01 - 90:04)
starter this year (90:03 - 90:06)
i think november i bet they do because i (90:04 - 90:08)
don't know that they want to put two of (90:06 - 90:10)
the next three as the starters but maybe (90:08 - 90:12)
i could see like (90:10 - 90:13)
november where we get chespin or (90:12 - 90:15)
something um (90:13 - 90:17)
and then you know like chest and litwick (90:15 - 90:18)
and (90:17 - 90:19)
i don't even know what else they would (90:18 - 90:21)
do (90:19 - 90:23)
we don't know september's yet right no (90:21 - 90:26)
no it's in like two weeks three yeah (90:23 - 90:27)
yeah yeah yeah (90:26 - 90:28)
it is (90:27 - 90:30)
we don't know i mean i don't think (90:28 - 90:32)
announcing the pokemon is that big of a (90:30 - 90:33)
deal the save of the date i think is way (90:32 - 90:36)
more important (90:33 - 90:38)
yeah but you can like get the anger down (90:36 - 90:40)
a little bit if you announce it further (90:38 - 90:41)
out then by the time it comes around (90:40 - 90:43)
everybody's got their anger out and (90:41 - 90:44)
they're no longer as (90:43 - 90:46)
as mad about it because you know people (90:44 - 90:47)
will be mad about it doesn't matter what (90:46 - 90:49)
pokemon it is it feels like a guest (90:47 - 90:51)
gentleman you're thinking people's anger (90:49 - 90:53)
is lesson i'm gonna guess that (90:51 - 90:56)
september's pokemon is sandile (90:53 - 90:58)
i just got a hundred percent i just (90:56 - 91:01)
hatched 100 sandpaper and i was thinking (90:58 - 91:03)
i can't evolve it until community day (91:01 - 91:05)
now so that it gets the move or whatever (91:03 - 91:07)
that it'll get why why are you sticking (91:05 - 91:08)
why do you think it's sandal i'm just (91:07 - 91:10)
i'm just i'm poking my database and i'm (91:08 - 91:12)
just like looking at like sets of threes (91:10 - 91:13)
that haven't been done yet and like it's (91:12 - 91:16)
a good shiny two sandals like the first (91:13 - 91:18)
set of three out of the (91:16 - 91:19)
gen (91:18 - 91:22)
five pokemon that have not been turned (91:19 - 91:23)
shiny right (91:22 - 91:25)
yeah it's only it's okay (91:23 - 91:27)
yet maybe we get hornets for how oh it's (91:25 - 91:29)
only in 12khz oh there's no way they do (91:27 - 91:32)
that never mind how to cancel that (91:29 - 91:32)
uh homage would be cool that could be a (91:33 - 91:38)
new that could be a new pokemon (91:35 - 91:40)
and just go shine and get the shiny out (91:38 - 91:41)
that's true (91:40 - 91:42)
they could do gothita they haven't (91:41 - 91:45)
turned gothi to shiny oh yeah (91:42 - 91:46)
yeah that'd be good i don't know i've (91:45 - 91:48)
got these like super exciting but it's (91:46 - 91:50)
got a big head it's easy for excellent (91:48 - 91:51)
throws (91:50 - 91:54)
solos so let's just also would be oh yes (91:51 - 91:55)
as well that's good i think i think (91:54 - 91:58)
solosis is more popular than gothita by (91:55 - 92:00)
far (91:58 - 92:01)
it's okay little blob (92:00 - 92:04)
yeah (92:01 - 92:04)
um i think that's it i think that's uh (92:04 - 92:09)
all we have for this week uh (92:07 - 92:10)
did (92:09 - 92:12)
lost origin come out or is that this (92:10 - 92:14)
weekend i think it's this comes out on (92:12 - 92:16)
friday friday yeah pre-release was last (92:14 - 92:18)
week but yeah (92:16 - 92:21)
uh mcdonald's has happy meals uh they're (92:18 - 92:23)
bad they're very bad toys they're (92:21 - 92:25)
they're they're just spinner things (92:23 - 92:27)
they're they're they're terrible you get (92:25 - 92:29)
a pack of cards there's nothing in those (92:27 - 92:30)
cards that are actually good or sought (92:29 - 92:32)
after pikachu there's a pikachu yeah (92:30 - 92:34)
there's pikachu (92:32 - 92:36)
um (92:34 - 92:38)
but yeah the little toy comes with is is (92:36 - 92:41)
terrible it's just like a weird (92:38 - 92:43)
roulette spinner i didn't realize it was (92:41 - 92:46)
a toy i thought it was just a (92:43 - 92:49)
just a there's a there's a toy in (92:46 - 92:51)
it's not in america it's in japan i (92:49 - 92:53)
think there's a side duck that dances (92:51 - 92:56)
oh yeah that thing's people are like (92:53 - 92:58)
just skyrocketed the price of this thing (92:56 - 93:00)
because of this really cute dance that (92:58 - 93:02)
it does (93:00 - 93:04)
but yeah good stuff uh (93:02 - 93:06)
also forgot to say that there's the (93:04 - 93:07)
halloween collection is now on (93:06 - 93:10)
pokemoncenter.com so (93:07 - 93:11)
it looks like they brought back some of (93:10 - 93:14)
the statues last year they have like (93:11 - 93:15)
some candy dishes (93:14 - 93:16)
um (93:15 - 93:19)
that's that's on pokemon center so (93:16 - 93:21)
if you if you like the halloween stuff (93:19 - 93:23)
i'm sure it will sell out (93:21 - 93:25)
uh because the halloween stuff always (93:23 - 93:27)
has sold out relatively quickly so i (93:25 - 93:29)
