off studio mode and I can stop this (0:08 - 0:16)

podcast live on twitch here and this is (0:31 - 0:38)
not like the normal routine here we're (0:36 - 0:41)
just last week we did it because I was (0:38 - 0:43)
out of town this week we're doing it (0:41 - 0:47)

listeners back to when gen-6 was (1:12 - 1:19)

things beside and move on with this new (1:42 - 1:47)
generation because we both saw rowlett (1:44 - 1:50)

Pokemon announced their starters which (3:26 - 3:32)
they seem to do every may actually going (3:30 - 3:34)
back on my facebook timeline three years (3:32 - 3:37)
ago was when we got the X&Y stuff and (3:34 - 3:40)
then before that I think I think diamond (3:37 - 3:42)
and pearl is also stuff was also (3:40 - 3:43)
announced in may but I don't remember (3:42 - 3:45)
that period as well as the x and y (3:43 - 3:49)
pillars of the dark years we're not (3:45 - 3:52)
talking about ruby and sapphire here (3:49 - 3:57)
alright so but ruby and sapphire you (3:52 - 4:00)
said diamond diamond pro confused by (3:57 - 4:02)
your timeline def continue I don't (4:00 - 4:04)
remember diamond pro that well but it's (4:02 - 4:06)
diamond pearl is way better than Ruby (4:04 - 4:08)
and Sapphire was just right you're right (4:06 - 4:12)
yeah so they showed their starters here (4:08 - 4:18)
and I like being right on the show mmm I (4:12 - 4:21)
like to throw that in people's faces I'm (4:18 - 4:24)
sorry that doesn't happen so I it yeah (4:21 - 4:27)
it happens very rarely I was very (4:24 - 4:29)
confident that the names i read off last (4:27 - 4:31)
week with my cat when Travis wasn't here (4:29 - 4:31)
with (4:31 - 4:34)
Micah and well fairly confident those (4:31 - 4:36)
names were not going to be the English (4:34 - 4:39)
names because I butcher every Pokemon (4:36 - 4:40)
name but those names were very hard to (4:39 - 4:44)
say and we did get new names but what (4:40 - 4:47)
people speculated the animals that these (4:44 - 4:50)
Pokemon are based on or some being (4:47 - 4:54)
inanimate objects like vanilluxe the (4:50 - 4:56)
animals that people speculated we're (4:54 - 4:59)
pretty close to right we'll start with (4:56 - 5:02)
uh Lytton first which is the fire cat (4:59 - 5:05)
Pokemon did you start with like the (5:02 - 5:08)
worst of them all at least we can agree (5:05 - 5:11)
on that yeah have some fighting words (5:08 - 5:13)
here already the description we have (5:11 - 5:16)
some fire fighting words here that the (5:13 - 5:19)
pokemon company has provided the (5:16 - 5:21)
cool-headed Firecat Pokemon Lytton is (5:19 - 5:24)
the next choice for a first partner (5:21 - 5:26)
Pokemon next choice probably because I (5:24 - 5:30)
mixed up the order here Linton's fur is (5:26 - 5:33)
rich in oils and is immensely flammable (5:30 - 5:36)
it constantly grooms itself by licking (5:33 - 5:39)
its coat collecting loose fur in two (5:36 - 5:41)
balls it then ignites these hair balls (5:39 - 5:44)
to create fireball attacks when the time (5:41 - 5:47)
comes for a little tumult it burns off (5:44 - 5:50)
all of its fur in one glorious blaze (5:47 - 5:54)
cats don't molt well that's disgusting (5:50 - 5:59)
this one does it started from greasy (5:54 - 6:02)
it's starting to ember it's just a plain (5:59 - 6:06)
fire type and yeah well we'll get to (6:02 - 6:08)
we'll get to all of these in a second (6:06 - 6:09)
here we'll just kind of go through the (6:08 - 6:11)
second one I have on the list is pop (6:09 - 6:14)
Papa leo Pope Leo the Pope of Pope town (6:11 - 6:20)
Papa Leo Pope won't even eat the Popo (6:14 - 6:23)
the buff you know Vatican City Pope tone (6:20 - 6:27)
he's the puppet poke down oh he's the (6:23 - 6:32)
Pope of pokes it is the sea lion Pokemon (6:27 - 6:35)
straight water starting move water gun (6:32 - 6:41)
the third possibility is the this mean (6:35 - 6:43)
not turning off my text messages (6:41 - 6:44)
shameful (6:43 - 6:48)
is a sea lion Pokemon populi Oh populo (6:44 - 6:50)
can create balloons made of water from (6:48 - 6:52)
its nose and utilize them to create a (6:50 - 6:55)
variety of different strategies and (6:52 - 6:58)
attacks in battle this Pokemon is better (6:55 - 7:01)
at moving on in the water than on land (6:58 - 7:04)
it can swim at speeds over 25 miles per (7:01 - 7:06)
hour that is American for those (7:04 - 7:09)
listening on land it uses the (7:06 - 7:12)
electricity of this balloons to create (7:09 - 7:15)
it creates to perform jumps and our (7:12 - 7:20)
acrobatic stunts see it's name is just (7:15 - 7:22)
here's here's the magic its name is very (7:20 - 7:24)
similar to squirtle right because (7:22 - 7:26)
squirtle is a squirrel and a turtle that (7:24 - 7:30)
squirts and pop Leo is our pop y ou is a (7:26 - 7:33)
puppy and a sea lion that pops balloons (7:30 - 7:38)
it's perfect I squirtle supposed to be a (7:33 - 7:40)
squirrel it's in the squirrel tail dude (7:38 - 7:43)
yeah its tail's a squirrel tail for sure (7:40 - 7:47)
I guess I never made that connection I (7:43 - 7:49)
just thought it was squirt because it (7:47 - 7:51)
squirted and it was a turtle yes (7:49 - 7:53)
squirrel and it's hurdle and it squirts (7:51 - 7:56)
I mean okay we'll get we'll get back to (7:53 - 7:58)
all these will do it will go in depth (7:56 - 8:00)
with said Pokemon the last one is well (7:58 - 8:02)
she'll end up with gent one Pokemon (8:00 - 8:04)
because all of these names are new to me (8:02 - 8:07)
squirt a square what ah the last one is (8:04 - 8:09)
route rowlett is that how we're saying (8:07 - 8:14)
it romia Rao like it's an owl's it so (8:09 - 8:18)
roll it okay it's a round outlet Oh his (8:14 - 8:20)
name is Charlie I suppose the round (8:18 - 8:22)
would make sense it is the grass quill (8:20 - 8:27)
pokemon isn't not to derail here but is (8:22 - 8:32)
it quad Elian a quill it up one quill at (8:27 - 8:36)
it I'm getting there Oh Travis pull that (8:32 - 8:38)
up it is a grass flying-type pokemon i (8:36 - 8:41)
if I'm not mistaken it is the first duel (8:38 - 8:48)
type since Bulbasaur of at least a first (8:41 - 8:52)
stage right first stage starter because (8:48 - 8:56)
I Torchic was just pure fire even though (8:52 - 8:58)
it turned into a (8:56 - 9:01)
abomination of a fighting pokemon will (8:58 - 9:04)
attend was the spiny armor Pokemon okay (9:01 - 9:09)
is it's not gone ah rowlett is the first (9:04 - 9:12)
of okay again I got these out of orders (9:09 - 9:15)
rowlett this Pokemon can fly silently (9:12 - 9:17)
throughout the skies sneaking up on its (9:15 - 9:19)
opponent without being noticed it can (9:17 - 9:21)
attack its opponents using powerful (9:19 - 9:26)
kicks and it has no legs powerful kicks (9:21 - 9:28)
and it can also attack from a distance (9:26 - 9:31)
using its razor-sharp leaves that form (9:28 - 9:35)
parts of its feathers rowlett can survey (9:31 - 9:37)
its environment and turn its neck nearly (9:35 - 9:42)
180 degrees from 180 degrees American (9:37 - 9:45)
for those measuring from front to back (9:42 - 9:47)
it can also see directly behind itself (9:45 - 9:51)
when in petal well it turns its head to (9:47 - 9:53)
face its trainer when waiting for (9:51 - 9:59)
instructions ah there you go what's cool (9:53 - 10:01)
about that is that there are species of (9:59 - 10:07)
owls that will like sneak up on prey and (10:01 - 10:12)
then eat them like yeah well I mean (10:07 - 10:14)
that's like what everything does but (10:12 - 10:15)
specifically this some species of all (10:14 - 10:19)
that sneak behind pray and then like (10:15 - 10:25)
slam into the back of the head of of (10:19 - 10:27)
either prey or things that are (10:25 - 10:28)
threatening to them like they do it to (10:27 - 10:31)
people sometimes they like will knock (10:28 - 10:33)
out the thing and so I think that's what (10:31 - 10:36)
they're supposed to be showing with (10:33 - 10:39)
rowlett kicking really hard that's a lot (10:36 - 10:42)
of assumption but sure gross i think (10:39 - 10:44)
because i think they kick i think that (10:42 - 10:47)
those owls do it by kicking too did you (10:44 - 10:49)
see the gift of the owl eating the (10:47 - 10:53)
rabbit you mean the right at oh no it's (10:49 - 10:56)
just uh no like a lopunny and now we'll (10:53 - 10:57)
eating a lopunny it's super gross (10:56 - 11:00)
because you only see the background on (10:57 - 11:02)
the love bunny house and they let me (11:00 - 11:06)
post it in the chat don't I probably now (11:02 - 11:09)
you cuz the link not that chat the skype (11:06 - 11:12)
chat so only you guys can see the horror (11:09 - 11:15)
nothing uh well if you post it in the (11:12 - 11:19)
twitch chat I'm Giroux can approve it (11:15 - 11:21)
drew is hanging up place but drew should (11:19 - 11:28)
not approve it uh uh let's let's go in (11:21 - 11:29)
depth with with these Pokemon where do (11:28 - 11:31)
you guys won do you just want to get ral (11:29 - 11:33)
it out of the way I feel like rally yeah (11:31 - 11:36)
I do all right well before we do that I (11:33 - 11:39)
ran a poll on our Twitter which Pokemon (11:36 - 11:44)
Sun and Moon starter is for you with 407 (11:39 - 11:47)
votes litton got thirty-seven percent (11:44 - 11:51)
rowlett got forty five percent and if (11:47 - 11:53)
you're counting American percentages (11:51 - 11:59)
Papa Leo that eighteen percent and cool (11:53 - 12:04)
pop Leo pop fly 00 polio Oh polio so I (11:59 - 12:07)
feel like there's there's a one Pokemon (12:04 - 12:11)
in every generation that kind of gets (12:07 - 12:12)
left behind I think we can all agree (12:11 - 12:14)
that Bulbasaur was that in generation (12:12 - 12:18)
one chart wig was that in generation (12:14 - 12:22)
three I feel Turtwig was a fourth trend (12:18 - 12:24)
starter Oh fourth gym sorry mmm they (12:22 - 12:27)
wrote a book about cast a popular seems (12:24 - 12:31)
to be the one left out here ah but I (12:27 - 12:33)
would argue though that last generation (12:31 - 12:40)
Generation X and Y 66 they all kind of (12:33 - 12:42)
had a really good balance but even (12:40 - 12:44)
before that generation 5 I feel like (12:42 - 12:47)
snivy was the one kind of left out yeah (12:44 - 12:52)
nobody wanted miss naívi so but I feel (12:47 - 12:56)
like that you're I think you're (12:52 - 12:58)
definitely right on that Gen 6 was (12:56 - 13:01)
pretty the starters were pretty equal in (12:58 - 13:04)
popularity like I really like froakie a (13:01 - 13:07)
lot of people really like chespin but (13:04 - 13:09)
then also a lot of people really liked (13:07 - 13:12)
um fennekin yes I think they each had (13:09 - 13:18)
their like strong mm-hmm fan bases and I (13:12 - 13:21)
think Jen five was similar i don't i (13:18 - 13:25)
don't think that many people hated (13:21 - 13:29)
snivy as much as like you know no one (13:25 - 13:32)
picks chikorita and jen to for example (13:29 - 13:34)
hey hey right you got like chikorita a (13:32 - 13:36)
lot it's probably a neighborhood of (13:34 - 13:38)
those three but i know a lot of people (13:36 - 13:42)
don't like it yeah I liked I liked (13:38 - 13:47)
chikorita to UM my first impressions (13:42 - 13:50)
when I I you know slept in I knew the (13:47 - 13:52)
Pokemon news was coming I wasn't like (13:50 - 13:54)
eager or like I need to wake up for this (13:52 - 13:58)
because I mean Pokemon podcast is not (13:54 - 14:03)
the first to deliver news and it's fine (13:58 - 14:06)
like where we we've gotten past that not (14:03 - 14:08)
the first delivered news but where you'd (14:06 - 14:10)
like talk about it which is more than (14:08 - 14:12)
you know okay this website posted the (14:10 - 14:13)
news you're done we're here to talk (14:12 - 14:15)
about it we're here to continue talking (14:13 - 14:16)
about it that's what we do I didn't rush (14:15 - 14:18)
to post the news so I woke up to a bunch (14:16 - 14:20)
of tweets and everything and the slack (14:18 - 14:23)
community very like like as soon as I (14:20 - 14:25)
started tweeting like the slack (14:23 - 14:26)
community was like a high-speed Jays (14:25 - 14:29)
tweeting witches was cool like yeah but (14:26 - 14:31)
I and right texted you and I was like (14:29 - 14:33)
dude what's up I was sleepin man okay so (14:31 - 14:37)
uh breaking news Pokemon podcasts not (14:33 - 14:39)
the first to deliver so I woke up to (14:37 - 14:41)
Irene texting me that there was a cat (14:39 - 14:45)
starter Pokemon and I was both excited (14:41 - 14:47)
like a kid on Christmas because I love (14:45 - 14:49)
cats I have three of them here at my (14:47 - 14:52)
house but I was also super scared (14:49 - 14:53)
because when i think of cat pokemon i (14:52 - 14:56)
think of / ugly and I know people like / (14:53 - 15:02)
ugly but prefer ugly is not for me sweet (14:56 - 15:04)
likes / ugly David tonight David really (15:02 - 15:06)
likes / ugly I like I think probably (15:04 - 15:12)
school yeah what as a cat lover you like (15:06 - 15:14)
and don't like certain types of cats (15:12 - 15:16)
like I don't like naked cats or those (15:14 - 15:17)
like hairless cats whatever they're (15:16 - 15:20)
called and I know people love lexus or (15:17 - 15:22)
whatever so if you if I was like oh man (15:20 - 15:24)
if the star pokemons a naked cat I'm (15:22 - 15:26)
sure people would flip out because (15:24 - 15:28)
people like those but I don't and like (15:26 - 15:30)
Prague we finally have why don't they (15:28 - 15:32)
have one of those why don't they have (15:30 - 15:34)
like a rex cat folk wanna be awesome (15:32 - 15:37)
like a little Egyptian theme I think of (15:34 - 15:38)
when I think (15:37 - 15:40)
kind of cans but yeah I can think like a (15:38 - 15:43)
ground-type yeah so when I saw Lytton I (15:40 - 15:45)
think the name is awesome even though (15:43 - 15:47)
some people were complaining that it's (15:45 - 15:50)
close to litleo and oh yeah Greg is (15:47 - 15:52)
telling me it's Fink's cat not Rex cat I (15:50 - 15:54)
got the it was a difference what is it (15:52 - 15:56)
Rep isn't a rex cat something to (15:54 - 15:58)
whatever I mean I live it but I don't (15:56 - 16:05)
know my my Laurent kids litton obviously (15:58 - 16:09)
kitten lit fire I don't know if there's (16:05 - 16:12)
any other puns in that name at all some (16:09 - 16:15)
people were upset that I saw that litton (16:12 - 16:18)
was very close to litleo and that not (16:15 - 16:24)
only in names but like we uh litleo (16:18 - 16:26)
evolves into a lie and minds are based (16:24 - 16:30)
on cats this is another cat lions are (16:26 - 16:33)
based on cats live your life animal lion (16:30 - 16:37)
what break you in a taste like cats were (16:33 - 16:40)
so big that you know they they came up (16:37 - 16:44)
with lions after that ah we are we going (16:40 - 16:50)
to top this with cat to lion ah my guess (16:44 - 16:54)
based on Linton's design is that Linton (16:50 - 16:57)
will evolve into more of a tiger than a (16:54 - 16:59)
lion we kind of have three lions at this (16:57 - 17:02)
point we have n ty we have pyroar and we (16:59 - 17:05)
have that new one which does not have a (17:02 - 17:09)
name we don't have any Tiger pokemon and (17:05 - 17:12)
tigers are very different than cats when (17:09 - 17:13)
I was a kid you know I always thought (17:12 - 17:18)
tigers were the female lions but they (17:13 - 17:20)
could do that actually I think it (17:18 - 17:22)
actually works yeah ligers everyone was (17:20 - 17:26)
like losing their minds over it when uh (17:22 - 17:30)
what is that movie that one about the (17:26 - 17:32)
vote for pedro or whatever with that (17:30 - 17:36)
movie man I holy dynamite yeah Napoleon (17:32 - 17:37)
Dynamite he talks about a lagger for (17:36 - 17:39)
like 10 minutes that may be so boring (17:37 - 17:42)
really know what is the what is the (17:39 - 17:46)
black cat calls Lytton oh no no no the (17:42 - 17:49)
black the big black one the big black (17:46 - 17:51)
one Persian like it's up its (17:49 - 17:53)
up there with pains and tigers Panthers (17:51 - 17:56)
do you mean like that you'll like that's (17:53 - 17:58)
what that's what Lytton is going to be a (17:56 - 18:01)
pant I would I get that but the market (17:58 - 18:03)
but the markings on lytton are kind of (18:01 - 18:07)
evocative tell your stripes yeah none (18:03 - 18:10)
the other people are speculating that (18:07 - 18:16)
Lytton will be a fire dark I mean I can (18:10 - 18:18)
see that it's black a lot of cats are (18:16 - 18:20)
black I think now it's not that nasty (18:18 - 18:23)
look in its eye it's like I mean it has (18:20 - 18:26)
like the stereotypical like I'm a smug (18:23 - 18:30)
cat look and I don't care yeah but like (18:26 - 18:33)
Esper didn't look smug and that's a cat (18:30 - 18:36)
yeah but Esper was like the derpy like (18:33 - 18:39)
Esper was like mean cat like to me this (18:36 - 18:42)
is like like stereotypical like black (18:39 - 18:48)
cat mm-hmm we can come back to that if (18:42 - 18:50)
we have more thoughts and lytton let's (18:48 - 18:53)
do rowlett here obviously the most (18:50 - 18:59)
popular the the Charmander of generation (18:53 - 19:04)
7 clearly yes i'm trying to think of (18:59 - 19:06)
this might be the most popular grass (19:04 - 19:10)
starter of all time at this point even (19:06 - 19:13)
more than chest in well yeah I mean (19:10 - 19:15)
maybe just in terms of like the press (19:13 - 19:20)
like our poll is not really (19:15 - 19:22)
representative because our poll is of (19:20 - 19:27)
people that are already definitely into (19:22 - 19:28)
Pokemon because why would they be (19:27 - 19:30)
following us if they weren't that's what (19:28 - 19:35)
they like but like anyone who has any (19:30 - 19:40)
kind of close relationship to Pokemon (19:35 - 19:42)
might follow the Pokemon Twitter account (19:40 - 19:47)
and I think on their poll rowlett was (19:42 - 19:52)
like slightly ahead of lytton as opposed (19:47 - 19:56)
to NARS was a bigger margin polygon also (19:52 - 19:58)
ran a poll obviously that's just a (19:56 - 20:00)
general video game website and their (19:58 - 20:02)
percentages matched our percentages (20:00 - 20:04)
pretty closely (20:02 - 20:06)
but yeah I would assume the Pokemon (20:04 - 20:09)
Twitter would have more of a even top (20:06 - 20:11)
pull up those numbers so and so that I'm (20:09 - 20:13)
not just getting it out there i remember (20:11 - 20:16)
i didn't mention this but Rawat's (20:13 - 20:19)
starting move is leaf achai believe is a (20:16 - 20:22)
brand new move mmm that's correct (20:19 - 20:25)
translates as this leaf in Japanese from (20:22 - 20:29)
the Japanese okay not that leaf or (20:25 - 20:31)
exactly I thought it was this leaf I (20:29 - 20:34)
said not that leaf because it's this (20:31 - 20:38)
sort of the joke i was making so again (20:34 - 20:40)
for my first impressions well as i (20:38 - 20:41)
looked at it and I was not disappointed (20:40 - 20:44)
with what I saw I looked at Rao rowlett (20:41 - 20:46)
I was like wow that looks really cool (20:44 - 20:47)
like I actually didn't see the leaf boat (20:46 - 20:50)
I at first until somebody pointed it out (20:47 - 20:55)
and I saw populi Oh Papa Leo Popo and I (20:50 - 20:57)
was like it's fine and I moved on and (20:55 - 20:59)
I'll get back to that in a second but (20:57 - 21:04)
the amount of memes were internet gifs (20:59 - 21:07)
and well I guess you can't have gifs off (21:04 - 21:10)
the internet breaking news maybe you (21:07 - 21:14)
can't add softly net but I can um I was (21:10 - 21:17)
just surprised how much momentum came (21:14 - 21:22)
behind rowlett so fast and that's not a (21:17 - 21:24)
bad thing again like I'm glad like I'm (21:22 - 21:25)
actually happy that like a grass (21:24 - 21:28)
starters getting a lot of attention (21:25 - 21:29)
because I feel like the grass starters (21:28 - 21:30)
are the ones that are forgotten about (21:29 - 21:37)
and the flying-type started haha the and (21:30 - 21:39)
I'll throw it to you guys before I share (21:37 - 21:41)
my opinions but obviously I think will (21:39 - 21:43)
is both of you guys are on Team rowlett (21:41 - 21:48)
right I'm undecided I mean I really like (21:43 - 21:50)
that papaleo just because that little (21:48 - 21:52)
animation they showed and he's like he (21:50 - 21:54)
just like stands up and he like has this (21:52 - 21:56)
like proud smile on his face and then (21:54 - 21:57)
he's like I'm going to squirt at you and (21:56 - 22:03)
like Bree it's real cute I would like my (21:57 - 22:07)
relatives my definite favorite I would (22:03 - 22:12)
like pop bleh Oh more but there's Anna (22:07 - 22:15)
it's probably just me but there's (22:12 - 22:17)
something weird to me about (22:15 - 22:23)
how Papa Leah's snout is like perfectly (22:17 - 22:25)
conical I realize it's supposed to sort (22:23 - 22:27)
of be invoking like a party hat or (22:25 - 22:30)
whatever or like I don't know just the (22:27 - 22:34)
fact that see lines in like shows will (22:30 - 22:36)
like hairy balls on their noses or (22:34 - 22:39)
whatever but like that's what it is but (22:36 - 22:42)
it like when it's not moving and you (22:39 - 22:45)
can't see how it relates to the rest of (22:42 - 22:49)
its head it looks like I it looks like (22:45 - 22:51)
that's where its faces and all of its (22:49 - 22:53)
faces there and its nostrils are its (22:51 - 22:56)
eyes and it confuses me and so then (22:53 - 22:58)
therefore I don't it's it looks like an (22:56 - 23:00)
abomination to me and I don't like it (22:58 - 23:05)
you Wow I i think what what doesn't do I (23:00 - 23:09)
realize it's just me and Iran say but no (23:05 - 23:10)
I think I think you're right to some (23:09 - 23:13)
extent I think what doesn't do popular (23:10 - 23:16)
justice is its perspective like if you (23:13 - 23:18)
look at just its fins in the basic (23:16 - 23:20)
picture it looks like that it was drawn (23:18 - 23:25)
just quickly or poorly and like you look (23:20 - 23:27)
at rowlett and at least in the the (23:25 - 23:29)
default images I'm talking about you (23:27 - 23:31)
look at rowlett and he has like he's (23:29 - 23:34)
around he's like compact he's cute he (23:31 - 23:36)
has the shading like you get everything (23:34 - 23:37)
in one like you get that cute ball (23:36 - 23:40)
package and then you look at litton and (23:37 - 23:43)
you you he's like drawn out as a cat (23:40 - 23:44)
he's walked like he has that cat (23:43 - 23:46)
perspective and then you look at papaleo (23:44 - 23:49)
which is a combination of a sea lion and (23:46 - 23:51)
a puppy and you're like I kind to see (23:49 - 23:54)
the puppy and I kind of see the sea lion (23:51 - 23:55)
but like what's going on with its (23:54 - 23:58)
mermaid tail like it doesn't know it's a (23:55 - 24:00)
clown it just doesn't like his like (23:58 - 24:02)
lower half of his body just doesn't look (24:00 - 24:05)
finished and if you look at pop low and (24:02 - 24:07)
other pictures he actually looks a lot (24:05 - 24:11)
better than like the standard PNG (24:07 - 24:13)
picture that Pokemon provided everyone (24:11 - 24:17)
let's oh yes PNG a file format those (24:13 - 24:19)
only can I also exist on the internet (24:17 - 24:23)
PNG's it or know you and maybe in your (24:19 - 24:26)
internet um can you explain what you (24:23 - 24:29)
meant about rowlett shading what like (24:26 - 24:31)
his like shading I must as own (24:29 - 24:35)
now is I was nothing that is his like (24:31 - 24:38)
shading in his picture like like from (24:35 - 24:40)
his bowtie below it's darker and it (24:38 - 24:42)
gives you like a sense of him being more (24:40 - 24:44)
round and that's what I mean like with (24:42 - 24:46)
it it's just like more design it's just (24:44 - 24:48)
the perspective that they drew Papa Leo (24:46 - 24:52)
at I think doesn't do it justice to (24:48 - 24:54)
others I'm going backwards but I was (24:52 - 24:57)
talking about pokemons poll earlier the (24:54 - 25:01)
numbers there are 41 percent rowlett 38% (24:57 - 25:04)
Lytton 21-percent papaleo so the (25:01 - 25:05)
difference between relat and lytton with (25:04 - 25:10)
only three percent okay I'm popular had (25:05 - 25:11)
a little bit more because i think our (25:10 - 25:18)
poll is eighteen percent uh yeah so (25:11 - 25:22)
popular obviously the the odd man out (25:18 - 25:26)
here even polygon I don't know why we're (25:22 - 25:28)
bringing polygonal on well it's just me (25:26 - 25:30)
they ran like they did a whole article (25:28 - 25:33)
about the starter Pokemon and like they (25:30 - 25:35)
asked everyone that worked at poppy lot (25:33 - 25:41)
haha Polly Papalii gone plan is working (25:35 - 25:43)
well they're gonna love pop fly out what (25:41 - 25:45)
their favorites was and they pulled it (25:43 - 25:47)
up in rowlett one but I think only one (25:45 - 25:50)
or two people said pop Leo and it was (25:47 - 25:52)
just like look at populo he's just the (25:50 - 25:55)
joke of this generation and if you look (25:52 - 25:58)
it I hope that's not the case and it's (25:55 - 26:01)
it's funny because when you look at when (25:58 - 26:04)
you look at X and why I was so team (26:01 - 26:08)
chespin until I saw chestnut and until I (26:04 - 26:10)
saw delphox and also after i saw delphox (26:08 - 26:12)
i was like no fennekin a hundred percent (26:10 - 26:17)
and I I just not that I'm like rooting (26:12 - 26:20)
for a specific Pokemon this generation (26:17 - 26:22)
but I just hope that the final (26:20 - 26:24)
evolutions don't like ruin the image (26:22 - 26:26)
that we're seeing now like populo I (26:24 - 26:31)
don't think could get any worse oh we (26:26 - 26:33)
could get where you say that now did you (26:31 - 26:35)
see the internet art of pop y ou turning (26:33 - 26:39)
into a juggalo did you know how (26:35 - 26:41)
difficult it was for me to have to (26:39 - 26:42)
explain to my co-workers what a juggalo (26:41 - 26:44)
is because they had never heard of (26:42 - 26:48)
to thing oh I'm from Michigan so that (26:44 - 26:51)
there I live in their home turf you (26:48 - 26:52)
probably have a go in your refrigerator (26:51 - 26:56)
right now I don't cuz I don't really (26:52 - 26:58)
drink pop but if I did I probably would (26:56 - 27:01)
have fade you don't really drink soda (26:58 - 27:05)
I'm from Michigan I don't know if it's (27:01 - 27:08)
forgot that now I don't know no bueno (27:05 - 27:12)
here's the one upset the Juggalos man oh (27:08 - 27:12)
my god the purge [ __ ] you know like (27:13 - 27:20)
I actually like don't really know that (27:17 - 27:24)
much about what juggalos care about so (27:20 - 27:28)
do juggalos listen to the show are there (27:24 - 27:32)
any way we are Travis I want to delivery (27:28 - 27:34)
wrapped chocolate I want to know if (27:32 - 27:36)
there are any juggalo listeners to the (27:34 - 27:38)
show and I want to know what starter the (27:36 - 27:42)
enjoy so please like we know that down (27:38 - 27:48)
with a pop lie oh yeah I out yeah that's (27:42 - 27:54)
what I want to know ah the next the next (27:48 - 27:55)
this kind of just carries the (27:54 - 27:59)
conversation a little further uh I saw a (27:55 - 28:01)
lot on Twitter that like people weren't (27:59 - 28:05)
feeling these starters not a lot but you (28:01 - 28:06)
know it's it stands out when somebody's (28:05 - 28:08)
like like I don't like any of these (28:06 - 28:11)
starters or like we can go back to pop (28:08 - 28:12)
Leo and go like I hate popular those (28:11 - 28:15)
design like has I've been asked that (28:12 - 28:18)
question at like live shows like which (28:15 - 28:20)
Pokemon do you do you not like and (28:18 - 28:21)
that's very hard for me to answer (28:20 - 28:24)
because i don't know i like all like if (28:21 - 28:26)
I was the pick and probably be bascal in (28:24 - 28:28)
because I know the history of baskin I (28:26 - 28:29)
know bass k'lon was only created because (28:28 - 28:32)
they needed more water pokemon and that (28:29 - 28:35)
frustrates me because I think I want to (28:32 - 28:37)
believe that Pokemon puts a lot of (28:35 - 28:39)
thought in all their pokemon but we know (28:37 - 28:42)
baskin ahead 0 thought and it frustrates (28:39 - 28:46)
me so yes I i dislike bass Kalin but I (28:42 - 28:49)
don't know like I it's hard for me to (28:46 - 28:51)
dislike any of these pokemon it's hard (28:49 - 28:52)
for me to dislike like chikorita even (28:51 - 28:54)
though like trigger is not my favorite (28:52 - 28:57)
but what are you guys as thoughts (28:54 - 29:00)
um I actually saw the opposite on (28:57 - 29:02)
Twitter I saw a lot of people saying man (29:00 - 29:04)
I haven't liked all three starters in a (29:02 - 29:06)
long time and I think all three of these (29:04 - 29:09)
look really good and that like people (29:06 - 29:11)
are super excited that it's kind of a (29:09 - 29:16)
solid core for this new game it's hard (29:11 - 29:23)
for me to like it's difficult to judge (29:16 - 29:27)
from this group what the the feel of (29:23 - 29:29)
Pokemon designs is going to be for this (29:27 - 29:33)
generation I feel like I feel like Jen (29:29 - 29:37)
yeah it was gen 5 and did some extension (29:33 - 29:39)
six is good too but Jennifer in that (29:37 - 29:41)
sense to you but Jen five had a very (29:39 - 29:45)
strong design philosophy I feel like (29:41 - 29:48)
that all of those pokemon feel like with (29:45 - 29:50)
the exception of like heat more which (29:48 - 29:51)
feels like it belongs in a different (29:50 - 29:54)
universe pretty much all the general jun (29:51 - 29:59)
5 Pokemon to me feel like they belong in (29:54 - 30:03)
the same region and I I and I can't like (29:59 - 30:05)
put a finger on what that commonality is (30:03 - 30:09)
but I haven't quite felt the same out of (30:05 - 30:11)
just and I mean I'm sure I'll change my (30:09 - 30:13)
mind when I see more pokemon in these (30:11 - 30:15)
three but I haven't really felt I'm (30:13 - 30:16)
gonna figure out what the common link is (30:15 - 30:22)
between I've I've heard like people talk (30:16 - 30:25)
about like oh maybe they'll all evolved (30:22 - 30:30)
into carnival like things like a tiger (30:25 - 30:32)
jumping through fire and it's gonna (30:30 - 30:36)
always yasir yes growl it with the bow (30:32 - 30:40)
tie is gonna be like ringleader but in (30:36 - 30:42)
terms of the design philosophy the (30:40 - 30:44)
entire generation it's obviously not (30:42 - 30:45)
we're going to have an entire generation (30:44 - 30:48)
of circus pokemon although that would be (30:45 - 30:51)
stellar hello and pokemon then confirmed (30:48 - 30:55)
yep although we already have one we do (30:51 - 31:00)
done no I hasn't donphan he's not like a (30:55 - 31:04)
real elephant like elephants are super (31:00 - 31:07)
big I mean like a normal type elephant (31:04 - 31:09)
yeah like I'm onion-like Mamoswine sighs (31:07 - 31:10)
I was about (31:09 - 31:13)
I was about to say elefante I mean I (31:10 - 31:20)
remember the deaths in neo pad speaking (31:13 - 31:22)
of Pokemon designs and I have to agree (31:20 - 31:24)
with Travis hundred percent i think (31:22 - 31:26)
pokemon designs are heavily based on the (31:24 - 31:31)
region they are this region which is (31:26 - 31:35)
officially confirmed is the ole ola (31:31 - 31:38)
myself like a like a like aloha which (31:35 - 31:40)
you would say to welcome or say goodbye (31:38 - 31:42)
to somebody in hawaii except it's a lo (31:40 - 31:46)
lot a lo lot so it's the aloe la región (31:42 - 31:51)
not confirmed hawaii but like basically (31:46 - 31:54)
but basically hawaii which now goes back (31:51 - 31:59)
to I so accessible to say Polynesia yeah (31:54 - 32:04)
okay which goes back to the the one-word (31:59 - 32:07)
answer of what to expect in the nice (32:04 - 32:09)
pokemon game which was that word was (32:07 - 32:13)
flowers I think Hawaii region fits that (32:09 - 32:16)
really well since I'm assuming this the (32:13 - 32:19)
the media of like when you get to why (32:16 - 32:20)
they give you flowers right away I'm I (32:19 - 32:23)
assume that still exists and some when (32:20 - 32:27)
they give you a lei yes yes sort of yes (32:23 - 32:30)
this is why I have you guys back me up (32:27 - 32:33)
we see some new characters we see (32:30 - 32:38)
obviously are our character both you (32:33 - 32:41)
know boy or girl and we see are you a (32:38 - 32:45)
boy or you girl we see our rival which I (32:41 - 32:47)
don't know if there's one or two but (32:45 - 32:50)
they only show a gentleman who is of (32:47 - 32:53)
darker-skinned who is your rival we (32:50 - 32:56)
everyone's assuming and we see somebody (32:53 - 32:59)
named holla and we see somebody named (32:56 - 33:02)
kooky am I saying those name Kukui Kukui (32:59 - 33:06)
uh oh wait who's holla how I was a (33:02 - 33:08)
bigger guy in the yellow shirt he's the (33:06 - 33:10)
one that all about the three of us yeah (33:08 - 33:14)
that's like the professor yeah so a lot (33:10 - 33:16)
of people thought I'm gonna what was (33:14 - 33:18)
that name koo koo koo koo e koo koo e (33:16 - 33:20)
everyone thought that was the professor (33:18 - 33:22)
because the lab coat kind of has like a (33:20 - 33:24)
professor Sycamore (33:22 - 33:27)

professor he'll he also calls you cousin (33:33 - 33:41)
in one of the trailers but uh yeah i (33:35 - 33:44)
think professor holla which is based off (33:41 - 33:46)
a tree it's actually based off a tree in (33:44 - 33:50)
hawaii if i'm not mistaken a hollow tree (33:46 - 33:53)
i'm not familiar with a hollow tree how (33:50 - 33:54)
does it spell this much sounds more like (33:53 - 34:00)
like a Jewish bread a day LA it could be (33:54 - 34:04)
the leaf on the tree but um yeah I mean (34:00 - 34:05)

the male trees now that I look at the (34:35 - 34:40)
picture of it yes that is a very (34:39 - 34:43)
familiar tree so I I did not know that (34:40 - 34:46)
it was called a holla but the scientific (34:43 - 34:47)
name for people who want to actually (34:46 - 34:50)
learn from our program is uh pandanus (34:47 - 34:53)

dancing because I got all the Pokemon (35:11 - 35:16)
professor named successful thing I've (35:13 - 35:20)
done on this show so far I safe to say (35:16 - 35:22)
that the challah is the professor even (35:20 - 35:26)
though that's not confirmed but he gives (35:22 - 35:28)
you his pokemon and his name is based (35:26 - 35:31)
off a tree I think that's that's pretty (35:28 - 35:34)
pretty set here and he isn't sticking (35:31 - 35:38)
his belt he does have a stick (35:34 - 35:38)

color sort of long like spindle e (36:10 - 36:17)
appendages I guess I guess hmm I like (36:12 - 36:20)

space but I i know that i'm getting sun (36:41 - 36:53)

Michigan it makes it such that unless (37:11 - 37:18)
it's like the middle of the summer it's (37:15 - 37:20)
it's never sunny so I need more Sun in (37:18 - 37:23)
my life so I'm buying Pokemon Sun I (37:20 - 37:26)

oh I love the bat the bat that's (38:35 - 38:42)
incredible and that attack where it does (38:40 - 38:44)
and it's like all the light beams come (38:42 - 38:46)
from the little connectors that it's the (38:44 - 38:48)
yellow parts on the wings and then the (38:46 - 38:50)
light beams come and they focus on the (38:48 - 38:51)
middle and then a blast comes out from (38:50 - 38:53)
the middle of the bat you got to watch (38:51 - 38:55)
the video frame by frame like I've done (38:53 - 39:00)
um it's real good is real amazing it's (38:55 - 39:03)
almost as good actually it's actually (39:00 - 39:06)
better than oblivion wing and Oblivion (39:03 - 39:09)
wing had one of my favorite attack (39:06 - 39:11)
animations of all time so listen (39:09 - 39:14)
seriously like like the light comes and (39:11 - 39:16)
like swirls in and then it's like a (39:14 - 39:19)
blast from the center of the of the bat (39:16 - 39:21)
and the bat just like looks so glorious (39:19 - 39:23)
like rising up in this whatever that (39:21 - 39:25)
temple is where they find because you (39:23 - 39:27)
look in the background it's obviously (39:25 - 39:30)
like some sort of temple building and it (39:27 - 39:32)
just like rises up and its wings spread (39:30 - 39:35)
out and it's just like obviously this is (39:32 - 39:39)
pokemon moon and its glorious and you (39:35 - 39:45)
have to get that one a few I feel I was (39:39 - 39:48)
except that you don't accept I'm kidding (39:45 - 39:51)
I've committed to Pokemon Sun and the (39:48 - 39:55)
abilities bulbapedia has them I actually (39:51 - 39:56)
don't know where they got them from (39:55 - 39:58)
maybe just from the core core article (39:56 - 40:01)
but rowlett how will have over girl (39:58 - 40:03)
we'll have blazed and popular will have (40:01 - 40:05)
torrent I think these are all standard (40:03 - 40:09)
abilities for starters yeah nothing (40:05 - 40:12)
about any anything else hidden wise oh (40:09 - 40:15)
and that's actually that's pretty much (40:12 - 40:18)
all all the news that we got we can get (40:15 - 40:23)
to the elephant in the room of possibly (40:18 - 40:25)
this game having the elephant Ella (40:23 - 40:28)
elefante in the room where's the (40:25 - 40:33)
elephant of character in Steve's room (40:28 - 40:36)
not your right yes my cats are all named (40:33 - 40:40)
elephant the looks to be that we're (40:36 - 40:41)
going to get character customization (40:40 - 40:45)
again and poke that again in these games (40:41 - 40:46)
that were was first introduced in (40:45 - 40:50)
pokemon X&Y now if you look at the there (40:46 - 40:51)
there was two trailers that came out (40:50 - 40:54)
there was an English trailer and there (40:51 - 40:56)
was a Japanese trailer the Japanese (40:54 - 41:00)
trailer way better it does a lot with (40:56 - 41:02)
like playing with your emotions which oh (41:00 - 41:05)
dude I littered I cried because it (41:02 - 41:08)
reminded me when I like I cuz like I was (41:05 - 41:11)
um like five years old when I moved to (41:08 - 41:14)
Hawaii and it was like so much of me (41:11 - 41:16)
going to kindergarten like halfway (41:14 - 41:19)
through the year in going from New York (41:16 - 41:22)
to Hawaii and like having to meet new (41:19 - 41:23)
people and everything when I was just a (41:22 - 41:25)
little tiny little kid and there was no (41:23 - 41:28)
pokemon to Greece those deals so I was (41:25 - 41:30)
on my own my dad bought the wrong kind (41:28 - 41:32)
of sandals and that's like how many what (41:30 - 41:34)
thirty-eight years later I still (41:32 - 41:36)
remember that my dad bought the wrong (41:34 - 41:40)
kind of sandals and I was mocked at five (41:36 - 41:42)
years old in kindergarten for wearing (41:40 - 41:45)
weird Jesus shoes oh you got the I don't (41:42 - 41:49)
wear sandals sandals not see my dad (41:45 - 41:51)
being you know a New Yorker for his (41:49 - 41:53)
whole life when he went there and like (41:51 - 41:56)
called my mom and told her what to get (41:53 - 41:58)
us he said Oh everybody wears sandals in (41:56 - 42:00)
Hawaii what he meant was everybody wears (41:58 - 42:04)
flip-flops but the word flip-flop was (42:00 - 42:08)
not in his vocabulary yeah but anyways (42:04 - 42:10)
that Japanese commercial number one at (42:08 - 42:12)
no Japanese in it it actually had more (42:10 - 42:15)
english in it anything else (42:12 - 42:18)
and it's really moving yeah it did so (42:15 - 42:22)
the the Japanese video showed pretty (42:18 - 42:25)
much your your boy and your girl screen (42:22 - 42:27)
and then it showed different skin colors (42:25 - 42:30)
I'll and from what I remember it had a (42:27 - 42:32)
lot more variety in the color of the (42:30 - 42:35)
skin than x and y i did but i could be (42:32 - 42:38)
mistaken but i also read that it did (42:35 - 42:39)
have more variety that there were only (42:38 - 42:45)
three in x and y ok cool and then if (42:39 - 42:48)
then i watch the trailer over and over (42:45 - 42:53)
to see if that went more of an extent (42:48 - 42:54)
because a lot of people were like well (42:53 - 42:55)
you know skin color doesn't confirm (42:54 - 42:57)
character customization and the right (42:55 - 43:04)
but they're wrong and that's okay if in (42:57 - 43:08)
in the English trailer specifically the (43:04 - 43:11)
male protagonist is wearing a blue and (43:08 - 43:14)
white striped shirt which by the way in (43:11 - 43:15)
the Japanese trailer the little boy (43:14 - 43:18)
who's like the main star is wearing a (43:15 - 43:19)
blue and white stripes sure which I (43:18 - 43:22)
thought was a nice touch so the main (43:19 - 43:23)
protagonist is wearing a blue and white (43:22 - 43:27)
striped shirt he's wearing gray pants (43:23 - 43:31)
with red pockets and red cuffs there is (43:27 - 43:35)
one shot of the male protagonist in the (43:31 - 43:38)
English trailer who is wearing a black (43:35 - 43:41)
and white striped shirt and the same (43:38 - 43:45)
pants but the cuffs are instead lighter (43:41 - 43:47)
gray than the grayness of the pants (43:45 - 43:51)
which confirms that the pants are while (43:47 - 43:52)
the pants and the shorter exactly the (43:51 - 43:55)
same they're different colors now a lot (43:52 - 43:57)
of people were like oh that could have (43:55 - 44:00)
just been a mistake no it's absolutely (43:57 - 44:03)
not a mistake first off if you that same (44:00 - 44:06)
exact scene where the boy is wearing the (44:03 - 44:09)
black and white shirt is in the Japanese (44:06 - 44:11)
trailer the same exact scene except in (44:09 - 44:13)
the Japanese trailer this is turning (44:11 - 44:16)
into like a spare change documentary no (44:13 - 44:19)
this is like a conspiracy arrears that's (44:16 - 44:22)
what spare change clothes oh I was a (44:19 - 44:24)
document on the documentary about 911 (44:22 - 44:26)
write your notes machine was he's a herd (44:24 - 44:28)
of let me tell you about (44:26 - 44:30)
the elephant type pokemon that's coming (44:28 - 44:33)
so in the japanese trailer there is the (44:30 - 44:35)
same scene but he's wearing the normal (44:33 - 44:39)
blue and white shirt so i find it hard (44:35 - 44:41)
to believe that out of both trailers (44:39 - 44:44)
that one scene there was a mistake in (44:41 - 44:46)
colors especially when they already had (44:44 - 44:48)
that scene produced in the japanese (44:46 - 44:51)
trailer which what you're saying is jet (44:48 - 44:54)
fuel can't melt great oh my god i was (44:51 - 44:55)
gonna make that joke and you stole it (44:54 - 45:00)
from me dare you hundreds of said ah so (44:55 - 45:02)
you are daddy of hers pokemon podcast (45:00 - 45:04)
confirming character customization (45:02 - 45:06)
someone's correcting me that it's called (45:04 - 45:10)
loose change not spare change so and (45:06 - 45:12)
here's where you're wrong they just made (45:10 - 45:14)
it so that if you get the japanese (45:12 - 45:15)
version of the game you get a blue shirt (45:14 - 45:17)
and if you get the v english version of (45:15 - 45:19)
the game you get a black shirt and dad (45:17 - 45:22)
this generations version of vivian or (45:19 - 45:25)
however you know that doctor and (45:22 - 45:27)
whatever region you get you get a (45:25 - 45:29)
different color you did get you get the (45:27 - 45:32)
same gray pants but they're exited a (45:29 - 45:37)
different color ah i would be so (45:32 - 45:39)
surprised if character customization was (45:37 - 45:42)
not in these games yeah the fact that i (45:39 - 45:50)
mean the people sit who are resisting (45:42 - 45:54)
the conclusion that character creation (45:50 - 45:56)
is confirmed are doing so on the (45:54 - 45:59)
pretense that it's not a hundred percent (45:56 - 46:03)
confirmed and like sure i mean i guess (45:59 - 46:06)
that's that's correct right you could (46:03 - 46:09)
also make me I mean that like Hawaii is (46:06 - 46:11)
not confirmed or halle is not the (46:09 - 46:14)
professor but I mean right right it's a (46:11 - 46:17)
Pokemon game it's it's not that in depth (46:14 - 46:24)
and do you like it would be okay Game (46:17 - 46:25)
Freak in the pokemon company have made (46:24 - 46:32)
some interesting decisions before but to (46:25 - 46:32)
give us character customization in Gen 6 (46:32 - 46:41)
have that be like the most hated part of (46:37 - 46:44)
oris the fact that it's not there (46:41 - 46:47)
anymore and then bring it part of the (46:44 - 46:51)
way back in jan 7 which in this in the I (46:47 - 46:54)
mean like I think the ability to choose (46:51 - 46:55)
between different skin colors is (46:54 - 46:57)
probably the most important part of (46:55 - 46:59)
character customization in pokemon but (46:57 - 47:03)
to have just that one segment of it (46:59 - 47:06)
would be very strange by think people (47:03 - 47:08)
are always going to complain because you (47:06 - 47:09)
don't have that extent of character (47:08 - 47:12)
customization that you have in say like (47:09 - 47:17)
a destiny or the fallout or something (47:12 - 47:19)
like that or Final Fantasy 14 where you (47:17 - 47:22)
can like change the nose and change the (47:19 - 47:24)
chin and change the facial hair and team (47:22 - 47:25)
well then the Elder Scrolls where you (47:24 - 47:29)
can just make a nightmare creature isn't (47:25 - 47:31)
Elder Scrolls just the game where you (47:29 - 47:33)
steal things up people's tables yup that (47:31 - 47:36)
why are we talking about that garbage um (47:33 - 47:38)
so I mean people are always going to be (47:36 - 47:40)
dissatisfied because like even Monster (47:38 - 47:42)
Hunter has more customization than (47:40 - 47:44)
you'll typically find it yeah my game so (47:42 - 47:46)
I think that's that I think that's the (47:44 - 47:49)
standard and the voice we should have as (47:46 - 47:53)
fans of the series is to demand more (47:49 - 47:58)
right like I want that character like (47:53 - 48:00)
the fact that we're getting more shades (47:58 - 48:02)
of skin colors already like a super big (48:00 - 48:06)
plus like right and probably it is due (48:02 - 48:08)
to the fact that people were very (48:06 - 48:10)
disappointed when that didn't return in (48:08 - 48:12)
oras yeah as long as I can get haircuts (48:10 - 48:15)
I'm fine you know some people care about (48:12 - 48:17)
hair some people care about skin color (48:15 - 48:21)
but hopefully it has it both alright (48:17 - 48:24)
when I have my girl character i want to (48:21 - 48:27)
have cute outfits for her that's fair i (48:24 - 48:30)
want to have the cutest of outfits for (48:27 - 48:32)
everyone the last thing i want to talk (48:30 - 48:34)
about before we read i actually didn't (48:32 - 48:37)
think this show would go so long but you (48:34 - 48:42)
know it's for all week and to all a good (48:37 - 48:44)
week 11 to one more little thing one (48:42 - 48:46)
more little thing about character (48:44 - 48:49)
customization that which you may not (48:46 - 48:51)
notice that you have a full-sized (48:49 - 48:54)
trainer throughout like when you're (48:51 - 48:55)
walking around (48:54 - 48:57)
and in the battles which in x and y you (48:55 - 49:00)
kind of got the shrunk drown trainer in (48:57 - 49:03)
the overworld which is a term i can't (49:00 - 49:04)
believe i'm using so it makes character (49:03 - 49:07)
customization that much better you have (49:04 - 49:10)
for you have full size this is the (49:07 - 49:11)
second week in a row i'm making (49:10 - 49:14)
hamburger fingers yeah in the overworld (49:11 - 49:17)
as opposed to a shrunk down trainer so (49:14 - 49:19)
you get your character customization is (49:17 - 49:23)
more legit has more value yes ah it (49:19 - 49:25)
looks so we saw footage of the game it (49:23 - 49:27)
looks that it it looks like it's running (49:25 - 49:29)
the Omega Ruby alpha sapphire engine (49:27 - 49:31)
which was based off the black and white (49:29 - 49:33)
engine but it actually looks slightly (49:31 - 49:35)
different which could just mean a brand (49:33 - 49:37)
new engine I don't know why they would (49:35 - 49:38)
just change the character in the engine (49:37 - 49:43)
oh no did you also see the way that he (49:38 - 49:45)
like there's part where he's on a path (49:43 - 49:48)
and he's running up and at an angle like (49:45 - 49:50)
you would never have had that in x and y (49:48 - 49:53)
that mean that kind of like a curved up (49:50 - 49:56)
and angle so that's yeah that look at (49:53 - 49:57)
the watch live it's right after Kakui (49:56 - 49:59)
welcomes him to a lola and you can see (49:57 - 50:01)
he's like running past a trainer so he (49:59 - 50:02)
must have just had a trainer battle and (50:01 - 50:04)
he's slowing up a hill it's on a ridge (50:02 - 50:06)
there's water on the other side but it's (50:04 - 50:08)
definitely like a curved angular up like (50:06 - 50:13)
up and to the left up another come up (50:08 - 50:15)
with your lovely job that you guys have (50:13 - 50:17)

about is the abbreviation of sun and (50:20 - 50:29)
moon i see a lot of people using capital (50:24 - 50:32)
s lowercase u capital m lowercase oh (50:29 - 50:36)
that's awesome forces no no I'm not (50:32 - 50:39)
approving of this laying down the ban (50:36 - 50:42)
hammer wish the slack community saw (50:39 - 50:45)
today oh we don't call diamond and pearl (50:42 - 50:48)
died pie we don't call red blue and (50:45 - 50:52)
yellow red blue yet it's red blue yellow (50:48 - 50:59)
are be why diamond pearl is just DP sun (50:52 - 51:05)
and moon sm i can't say why that's wrong (50:59 - 51:08)
because this is a kid-friendly show see (51:05 - 51:09)
if you know why this is roll (51:08 - 51:11)
let's back it up let's back it up it is (51:09 - 51:16)
not s and M it's not Pokemon so boom (51:11 - 51:18)
it's not he's right he's right it's not (51:16 - 51:21)
you sit you D&P it's just D P and D P (51:18 - 51:23)
stands for a lot of bad things besides (51:21 - 51:28)
dr. pepper let me tell you are not (51:23 - 51:36)
tearing SNM I'm saying sm smooth milk (51:28 - 51:36)
Sun and Moon it's not Rhett it's not R&B (51:36 - 51:48)
and why it's RB why red blue yellow yeah (51:41 - 51:52)
yeah true one that's true hgss heartgold (51:48 - 51:55)
soulsilver it's not hng & S & S & S & S (51:52 - 52:00)
& hgss like what I don't this is what (51:55 - 52:01)
I'm putting down the ban hammer I don't (52:00 - 52:03)
know why people decided to put the and (52:01 - 52:07)
between Sen because the and was never (52:03 - 52:09)
there for the first now that's true (52:07 - 52:12)
kwani Pokemon games like no one ever put (52:09 - 52:14)
me and between gold and silver it was (52:12 - 52:18)
just always GAO su mo is clever cuz it's (52:14 - 52:23)
like it's clever work but we like we (52:18 - 52:25)
didn't need that for any other game like (52:23 - 52:27)
like I said diamond and pearl is not d (52:25 - 52:31)
IP you had to innovate before we add no (52:27 - 52:32)
idea what to do in black 2 and white 2 (52:31 - 52:37)
halo I will also be 2w to uh remind our (52:32 - 52:40)
listeners that this argument is coming (52:37 - 52:44)
from a man who got angry literally angry (52:40 - 52:46)
because the word Thunder exists when (52:44 - 52:49)
it's just the sound that lightning makes (52:46 - 52:55)
yes is a hot dog a sandwich you know (52:49 - 52:59)
what makes a chair chair button it yeah (52:55 - 53:02)
you're you're especially sad Travis is (52:59 - 53:06)
sitting in his bed Thunder I I don't I (53:02 - 53:07)
only chair was in this room of this (53:06 - 53:11)
releasing the argument was lightning (53:07 - 53:14)
makes a sound the sound of lightning (53:11 - 53:16)
like that statement is valid because (53:14 - 53:20)
lightning makes a sound but yeah but the (53:16 - 53:22)
sound of a foot hitting the ground (53:20 - 53:24)
does a stop like there's other there's (53:22 - 53:29)
other things that happen there's other (53:24 - 53:31)
aesthetic experiences that are purely (53:29 - 53:34)
sound that we make words for no no no I (53:31 - 53:37)
agree i'm just saying that it's it's not (53:34 - 53:39)
wrong for me to say lightning makes a (53:37 - 53:41)
sound because people correct you and (53:39 - 53:44)
they go you mean Thunder like well if (53:41 - 53:46)
anyone corrects you or something like (53:44 - 53:48)
that their parents and their annoying (53:46 - 53:50)
like you don't have to say it's (53:48 - 53:52)
lightning and thundering you could just (53:50 - 53:55)
say it there's lightning outside because (53:52 - 53:56)
because people actually don't say that (53:55 - 54:00)
they say it's thunder and lightning yeah (53:56 - 54:02)
but you don't Harry very right Thunder (54:00 - 54:04)
happens regardless of if you hear it or (54:02 - 54:07)
not migration to the choir did you just (54:04 - 54:09)
hear and talk over I like I don't even (54:07 - 54:11)
know if I'm pointing at spj I just point (54:09 - 54:15)
you have talked over my reference to UM (54:11 - 54:18)
that song oh my god what is the name of (54:15 - 54:23)
the song Bohemian Rhapsody what one hey (54:18 - 54:25)
Meenakshi has tested positive lightning (54:23 - 54:29)
my finding me Galileo oh hey you may (54:25 - 54:33)
have just cracked the code Thunderbolts (54:29 - 54:36)
thunderbolts are lightning Thunderbolt (54:33 - 54:39)
are lightning they're not the noise they (54:36 - 54:41)
are very very frightening I can't mean (54:39 - 54:44)
like a cat meows a dog barks let nning (54:41 - 54:47)
makes thunder but to say like that muse (54:44 - 54:49)
my only by only point was you you don't (54:47 - 54:51)
always have to say it's lightning and (54:49 - 54:54)
thunder like you'd like yes you see a (54:51 - 54:56)
dog you don't have to tell me that it (54:54 - 54:58)
barks I know that it barks I know that (54:56 - 55:00)
lightning makes a sound and I know that (54:58 - 55:02)
sounds Thunder so to say it's lightning (55:00 - 55:04)
and thunder thundering is redundant (55:02 - 55:07)
because lightning makes Thunder Thunder (55:04 - 55:09)
would not exist without lightning is (55:07 - 55:17)
running the show on that in next week's (55:09 - 55:19)
episode of it's super effective we read (55:17 - 55:21)
Friedrich Nietzsche's on truth and (55:19 - 55:24)
falsity in their extra moral sense join (55:21 - 55:26)
us then join us then I I think the I (55:24 - 55:30)
think the Sun and Moon conversation was (55:26 - 55:32)
productive I think we got a lot of the (55:30 - 55:35)
way I heard that there's going to be (55:32 - 55:36)
another (55:35 - 55:38)
snippet of news weather how big or small (55:36 - 55:39)
it is i'm assuming it's going to be on (55:38 - 55:40)
the smaller side that is supposed to (55:39 - 55:46)
come on friday so we will Travis will be (55:40 - 55:47)
out of town but will and I will probably (55:46 - 55:49)
record something on sunday as we do (55:47 - 55:51)
normally I don't know if this will go up (55:49 - 55:56)
now sumo is wrong Greg its SM SM if you (55:51 - 55:57)
want to put the end in there you know (55:56 - 56:01)
I'm not gonna I'm gonna laugh but SM is (55:57 - 56:10)
fine d p GS hgss 0 ras yeah you don't (56:01 - 56:12)
say or is you say horas because it's the (56:10 - 56:14)
thing you can say so it's where we've (56:12 - 56:16)
deviated before and I was trying to get (56:14 - 56:19)
oars to go through no no you don't ya (56:16 - 56:21)
because okay all right okay with (56:19 - 56:23)
breaking the rules then because that was (56:21 - 56:28)
clever then sumo is clever now no sumo (56:23 - 56:30)
is no no but there's no there's no point (56:28 - 56:33)
for the you or the oh there's just no (56:30 - 56:36)
yeah they really are pointless like if (56:33 - 56:39)
there was multiple Pokemon games that (56:36 - 56:44)
started with an S or an M and (56:39 - 56:46)
everybody's like sumo is a word you can (56:44 - 56:47)
pronounce you know what's another thing (56:46 - 56:51)
you can pronounce you could say smooth (56:47 - 56:53)
if you get in a ball you thought oh I'm (56:51 - 56:56)
bottle the bottle catch up and look as I (56:53 - 56:59)
don't want kids googling Pokemon SNM no (56:56 - 57:01)
one puts the and in there though that's (56:59 - 57:02)
that's the point I'm trying to make no (57:01 - 57:05)
one when you google heartgold soulsilver (57:02 - 57:10)
you don't Google Hg and SS you don't put (57:05 - 57:16)
the and in there right sumo sumo like (57:10 - 57:18)
when your surgical red blue know is you (57:16 - 57:20)
done to say and it's more fun to say (57:18 - 57:24)
than sm right well I now I posit this (57:20 - 57:29)
make it ms pokemon ms and just say ms (57:24 - 57:32)
like like it's it's an armed indicated (57:29 - 57:34)
indicative of whether it's married or (57:32 - 57:38)
single that's fine The Scream on biz (57:34 - 57:40)
that's it spoken we can reach that (57:38 - 57:43)
compromise it's miss pokemon right i (57:40 - 57:45)
mean like an x and y is a good example (57:43 - 57:49)
pokemon XY x (57:45 - 57:51)
and why hi guys what I'm just saying I (57:49 - 57:54)
think we as a community on the side on (57:51 - 57:58)
one term and I'm strongly behind this is (57:54 - 58:00)
a little higher but we can only decide (57:58 - 58:02)
on one term we cannot have multiple (58:00 - 58:05)
cannot have chaos and the universe has (58:02 - 58:10)
decided on Pokemon sumo I like the you (58:05 - 58:13)
are put the universe did decide on (58:10 - 58:15)
Pokemon sumo but there is a lot of (58:13 - 58:18)
debate of not using suma anymore as (58:15 - 58:21)
decided on the ever so popular reddit we (58:18 - 58:23)
have our / Nintendo our / 3ds and r / (58:21 - 58:26)
Pokemon all now getting rid of sumo (58:23 - 58:27)
because of the arguments I made today (58:26 - 58:29)
not I'm not saying I'm the leader behind (58:27 - 58:32)
this but I'm saying this never used an (58:29 - 58:36)
in the past we've never used a second (58:32 - 58:39)
characters of a Pokemon game as in you (58:36 - 58:42)
and oh in the past why are we using it (58:39 - 58:44)
now just because it's a fun word to say (58:42 - 58:48)
yes debate it also the only reason I'm (58:44 - 58:49)
bringing this up is because it's (58:48 - 58:50)
something to talk about so if you guys (58:49 - 58:52)
want a shorter show that's fine we're (58:50 - 58:54)
compliant you are complaining about had (58:52 - 58:56)
ants and who has now become the ultimate (58:54 - 58:59)
pet and I I mean if I didn't complain (58:56 - 59:02)
about something this be a pretty boring (58:59 - 59:04)
show now I'd be complaining about (59:02 - 59:06)
something so that's true that's true one (59:04 - 59:09)
of us has to have a sand in our (59:06 - 59:11)
something but at the end of there's a (59:09 - 59:14)
snake in my buddy at the end of the day (59:11 - 59:18)
I don't really care about it well I (59:14 - 59:20)
think never I think it wraps it up for (59:18 - 59:23)
