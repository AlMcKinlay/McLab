[Music] so [Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 462 episode of the pokemon podcast it's super effective i am here today almost forgot my name it is spj with me 462. starting off on a banger right now it is greg i am here traveling i am back for my whirlwind tour of the east coast uh if by tour i mean philadelphia and hamilton new jersey uh trenton makes the world takes those of you who know

of really great me so you can add to your to your mitopia just find me on twitter say hey what's your access key i can join you on your adventure i sent an ideal picture to steve of steve in my adventure and he just ignored it i yeah that's true i did you just i mentioned it i meant to say something but then i didn't yeah typical will is still on the east coast so we have al back with us yes and and i will try my best not to talk too much about eurovision today but nobody you can talk a lot about it who do we know who won is it done is the winner it is done yeah it it well okay spoiler alert for eurovision italy one italy yeah but it was supposed to either be ireland or australia those were the two both of them didn't qualify for the final what are these things i don't care those are the two those are the only two places i care about currently look kangaroos are not europeans scotland even put anything in scotland not being an independent country at this point in time do not have that yeah so i don't care about that uh how is it al is on the show i am i learned more things about scotland i don't know what this independent country means what was that you can't say that america bought a war of independence to be free of scotland and we are scotland technically is it free it's a it's a really he has the keys thanks i mean you really don't want to get into this this is going to go this is going to go seriously political so quickly even the answer to that question is political all right it gets ugly fast we have we have al here we have gibbel community day coming up we have uh some tcg we got we got some a lot of tcg stuff do we have amazing 25th anniversary songs to celebrate do we have an amazing 25th anniversary distribution to talk about or are we just going to say that the 25th anniversary brought us shiny wulu we can start with the shiny wulu can we because there are worse things by this thing when this goes out it's gone yeah yeah the the wulu is gone normally uh so we'll start off with that pokemon news pokemon.com heard wulu and double in max raid battles shiny wulu appearing in sword and shield for a limited time that was may 23rd uh from 5 p.m pdt until they actually don't even have an end date on pokemon.com good uh it ended it ends tonight but by the time this episode comes up it will be over lucky trainers will have a chance to counter shiny wow they really somebody at pokemon.com really they literally said when it started you could encounter shiny wulu and then it said how to connect to the internet to access max raid dens this was probably the shortest raid announcement they have done since they started doing this was this for international wool day was that this weekend i don't know why did they do it this weekend was there a reason was it for eurovision i don't think there was unless there were sheep in eurovision that there's always sheep in eurovision it's eurovision europe is mostly sheep somebody brought people on stage i hope i did not see any sheep i saw a massive 12-foot moon and some massive inflatable trumpets but no no sheep covered complications presumably assumed okay there's gotta be an international wool day i'm looking it up uh yeah this it's fine i mean the wooloos came and went and not i stay i i have done every one of these max raid battle weekends uh even though i've always frustrated their last minute and there's usually eight other pokemon events happening the same weekend and i have noticed that this even though it was wulu so it's either two things either and i think it's the latter but either number one maybe just everyone decided to shiny hunt right when the game came out or number two people just don't care anymore and i feel like it's just people are very like over so i will say that most of the people that i watched that are shiny hunters when sword shield first came out were all shiny hunting bulu because it was the black sheep thing so i don't know that also it came literally out of the blue like all of these dudes all of them do but it's like but it's like oh lulu i mean i guess i i find these funny because it feels like because they're so sudden it feels like what they've done is somebody's gone oh we need an event this month we've not done one look it's the last second last weekend in the month who's going to do it right let's just press it live choose a random number right let's let's do it do you participate in these at all al do you get ready for these events i do i've not got them every single time because i can't be bothered i certainly can't avoid finding shiny myself um and what i tend to find is that if you're doing random online ones apart from the absolutely dreadful way to try and actually get the list updated so you can join them i find that either it's just a whole bunch of people putting up the one to four star ones which let's be honest nobody cares about it or you fi you finally find a five star one and of course it's full because there's only four spaces and in fact three spaces because one's taken up by the host yeah so i find that a relatively frustrating experience so it's good when somebody for example in the slack uh finds one and then lets people jump on yeah that way i i have a wonderful angel that finds them and when they find one sends me messages like hey do you want to get on this and i'm like yes uh fyi a wool awareness week is september 28th to october 6th okay not not in may no but april 9th was the first european wool day still not me still not mad maybe they had to push it back uh i still with with this like there's always somebody who comes in or somebody in the slack that will find a shiny and then they'll let people join and then they'll they'll not they'll like restart their switch so they can host it again and whatever if that's what you're cool with if you like being the person that hosts to make people's days i get it and then if you're the person that's like look i just don't have six hours this weekend to try uh and i'm just gonna join one of my friends who did this for me i get it i still like the discovery of trying to find it myself steve we don't all have a billion don't enjoy wishing pieces last time i checked you're like i'm just gonna go around once and if i don't find it i'm out and then you went back right when i found one and then you got all mad at me because i had a shiny meowth and you're like why didn't you let me know well you you didn't even care you didn't care long enough to stay in the game well i that was because pokemon snap came out that weekend and i did zootopia came out on friday and i think we've got a wulu hold on side side note i don't think i would like metopia why i don't know it's cute yeah okay funny uh going back your friends can join you on adventures i was not frustrated at the like concept of like i love meowth so when gallery and meowth was featured as a shiny i would that was like oh that i would have probably wanted to try to get like six of them but they did it on the launch weekend of pokemon snap not even like give pokemon snap a week to breathe and then like it was either there was a go event that weekend as well wasn't yeah yeah so that was the frustrating part because and i literally just threw a master ball at it i was like i don't want i want them shining me out and then i'm moving on you you used a master ball yeah what like shining me out that much i feel betrayed giovanni would be very proud of me no no giovanni never had a master ball in his life giovanni does it the old way extortion well it depends which giovanni we're talking about almost he did he did i think pick up the master ball and you have to get off him so yeah this will be bad bad podcast but good for video i i got this oh yay pokemon adventures uh three it is the complete sorry collector's edition but it's all it's thick it's all the little books that they merge into one yeah i have all the little books individually because i really like that yellow series and so i i was i went to chicago yesterday and they have a bookstore attached to mitsuwo which is a japanese marketplace and they had two they had two through eight they were missing one um and there's there's a dodrio with a with a saddle on the back here and then there's a fat pikachu which is ultimately what caused me to buy it yes that saddle looks attached to its beak yeah whether that's the rain [Applause] the thing that spectator and glass deer have the yeah they are the reigns not lasso very different thing um so i was like i looked them up on amazon and they were like two dollars cheaper and i was like okay well you know instant said gratification i'm right here i'll get something because i never get anything from that bookstore but i feel like i feel bad that i'm the person that always walks around this bookstore every time i go to mitzvah and then i don't get anything why because i feel like i feel like if any kind of store needs business it's a bookstore now did you get the english translation or is it japanese inside no so they have a whole english wall and then their isles are like the jed they have like the japanese aisle and then like the adult isle and the other japanese and the japanese and then the adult and the japanese but those those are like but the whole english wall is the english wall so they do have they did have like in the japanese aisle if you search for p they did have like the pokemon in japanese specifically uh but when i was going up to buy it the guy was like did you read one and two and i said nope and he goes well you know it's a whole different story and i'm like yup that's why i know i don't have to read one and two it's a good story too but this is this is the uh this is this dude is yellow but not the yellow in the well obviously because he's wearing a cowboy hat you need you need to read you need to read that book what book the squirrel book the yellow because you just made a whole bunch of mistakes look i just bought it honestly you know what's gonna happen it's gonna sit on the shelf for about 20 years i was going to say are you ever going to take it out of the cellophane probably not i bought it because there's a fat pikachu on the back i like how you you uh point out that it's different from you were going to say the yellow in the game there is no yellow in the game the game is is ash that's the the entire point of yellow was that it was meant to be a version that is more closely aligned oh yeah yeah but the default name is like yellow i don't know it's not it's ash no it's not yes it is am i going to have to pull out the game and show you is it look i don't know what scotland version of pokemon yellow you got but i'm pretty sure it's it's like yellow ash dean and like jacob or something there's like foreign the three names what are the three names in red it's like red oh blue this would be on a bar trivia quiz of like what are the three names that you get presented in pokemon red and then because the names in blue are different right it's like blue yeah i don't even think it says gary though it doesn't say gary and ash for red and blue no gary i think it has for the uh the rival it does have gary as my rival because when i started it up i was with my brother whose name is gary and i was like oh funny that's weird because i didn't know anything about pokemon oh because the rival had like three names too yeah yeah but you don't get presented with anything all right it's just question mark question mark do you want do you want the spoiler for pokemon yellow the manga it's the 20 year old manga shirt yeah it's not a dude is this a metroid yeah this is this is a metroid well how is it really not read any of this this manga how far into the book do i have to get uh it's in the first six chapters i think six drafts the first thing how many chapters are there there will be like there's seven chapters there's like there's like eight no i don't remember how many there are in total there is a there is a rom hack of a pokemon game that plays through the manga story line so that might be better for you steve if you don't actually want to read a book nah nah i just i suggested a rum hack of course you're not going to do that no i just want to buy i just like buying pokemon stuff and then letting it do nothing that is my did we get the names of red and blue oh were we supposed to get those you're using the greg you're the one that looks things up look i was looking at how many chapters there are in the yellow adventures i don't remember uh why would i search for that see but the thing why i think i gravitated towards this big book is because it's not like seven little books maybe hmm yeah i think i want i would rather have one universal thing than a bunch of little things but maybe i'm not sure now i'm thinking about how i buy things now it's a little late uh one website says it's yellow ash and jack for jack jack i said jacob dang i was close so yellow yellows before ash yes fine yeah i think is the just the color is the first one yeah well i knew that was the case for red and blue but i didn't think that was the case for yellow well what were they in red weren't we asking about red yeah because i'm pretty sure rhett i was like taken aback when i played blue and like it was like blue and then two names that were not my name and i was like how could they it was like timothy or david or something not timothy i don't think that's you could don't think you could do that many characters but yeah it was it was red and then two other just random names yeah they were pretty generic like yeah boy names sorry to anyone named whatever the readable we are as as greg looks that up i'll i'll queue up the next news here you think bubblepedia would have it they'd probably do under some weird trivia section probably we're getting into the timeframe where it would've been quicker just to build up the game and start a new one but i mean this is on pokemon.com luminous legends y introduces sylveon and evil tall to pokemon go challenge team rock team go rocket i hate that name still team go rocket and complete themed research during this two-part event part one is over skip to part two uh the second part started tuesday oh sorry the second part starts this tuesday may 25th from 10 a.m to monday may 31st to 8 p.m during part two you'll be able to add sylveon to your pokedex by earning a lot of hearts with an eevee when it's your buddy it doesn't say here um and i don't know if niantic has said it but the day in a mind said that it was 30 hearts which is pretty easy i think to get if you've done the muddy stuff it's pretty easy to get about 10 day if you're not even trying um there will also be a sylveon inspired avatar in the shop to celebrate the intertwining debut in pokemon go several other eevee evolutions like vaporeon jolteon flare and espn and umbreon will be appearing in three star raids for part two of the event you can also earn encounters with eevee and some of its evolutions by completing field research tests by earning and you can earn poffins by completing event exclusive ar mapping research evie and sylveon aren't the only pokemon to be in the spotlight of part two uh pokemon appearing more in the wild like ralts spritzy swirlix and several dark type pokemon uh will be that were featured in part one will also be featured in this event plus seven k eggs will include eevee klepha iggly buff togepi azurill spritzy and swirlix how can i find it for the rival and not for the maine did you find maine it was blue gary and john were the rivals but i can't find it for the maine oh internet why are you bad it's kind of crazy how much pokemon information is out there that like cereby doesn't document like cerebri documents a lot of the gameplay stuff but like i saw joe tweet at um pokey jungle we've had poke jungle and joe both on the show uh but like pokey jungle will tweet a lot of japanese merchandise when it's released there's like no merchandise stuff on therapy like yeah which is kind of like there that as somebody who just bought an 18 book that will gather a bunch of dust on the shelf there's a lot of pokemon merchandise and i don't even know where to go to like look up that stuff like there's there's not a website out there that documents that i mean bulbapedia has some merchandise documented uh like i'm sure you can look up the burger king gold cards on bubblepedia and you can look up the i want to say bulbapedia's card database is better than cerebes but i'm sure there's an even better database out there yeah i suspect it's just because there's a ridiculous amount of it right like how how far levels do you go down like even if you just talk about cards that's so many cards and then there's the plushes and there's the the manga there's there's just so many things where do you stop uh according to this youtube let's play that i just started watching it it's red ash and jack so they only changed it to yellow jack jack jack got double dipping jack has been there all along it's been jack the entire time interesting but if if you were ideally to start databasing merch i think databating the history data basing the history of merch would be harder than keeping up with it because there has to be there has to be like at least poker jungle knows when the japanese stuff comes out because he's on top of it every so much merch that would be like you would have to database each tiny figure if you're going for the merch in japan so which means you have to catalog each figure and then when they changed as well as every plush and every sitting cutie as long as every time they've changed those plus you know that there's going to be one every shirt they've ever made every plate every butter dish like that is that is a massive amount of work for nobody who cares yeah i think the issue people do care the main issue i don't the main issue i don't think is actually keeping that up to date is actually making it useful like how how how do you categorize that you know do you just have a massive list and you just have a search in it like it's it's an insane level of detail you'd have to go in for it to be truly useful that's multiple people's full-time jobs yeah i can't even imagine i can barely navigate serbia as it is much less necessarily merchandise database well like i think that's a saturday issue rather than anything else like i have i have a bunch of pokemon merch um that i don't know exactly when it was made so it'd be interesting to like look that up but yeah they have tags on them or this is this like like i have for example i have like two pokemon bandanas that are that were only they only came from japan there was a point in time this was i don't think you could do this anymore but back in like 2013 what i would do is i would go to ebay every night and then i would search free shipping and then i would search pokemon center the word pokemon center and then i would sort by ending soon and there would be a bunch of things mislabeled uh that like didn't get any bids but it would be free shipping and then it would only be like four or five dollars and i would order that stuff and it would be stuff from the official pokemon center in japan so you get those like tiny little cups that they have or in the case bandanas and i would only pay just a couple bucks for each of them and they would be free shipping because i would only filter by free shipping and i would i would get a bunch of weird pokemon center trinkets and stuff every couple weeks because it was like your own bizarre loot crate it kind of was why and what did you do with it did you just put it in a box yeah but like like looking behind me like i have i have something like this which it may be in in this is this is the pokemon go go fest uh i guess it has a date on it so i could be like oh it's 2019. but if it didn't have that date in like 15 years people would be like oh where did what pokemon event would is that was that from no i don't think anyone's saying that to you [Laughter] i don't think i'm not suggesting i suspect greg is suggesting this but i'm not suggesting that such a database would not be useful i am i'm saying that the level of detail would be too much and not just that you've got to remember it's not even it's not it's obviously not just america but it's also not just japan there are many different things in different countries that only released in that one country and good luck finding english translations of those to figure out the data for it amazon already struggles with keeping their merchandise in order much less a giant database of all-time pokemon stuff i would i would say though that a merch database wouldn't would be complicated i'm not gonna i don't wanna downplay that it wouldn't be complicated but like documenting an entire game like black 2 white 2 is probably more complicated than saying like this these sitting cutie these 150 sitting cuties came out in july you're taking a very limited number there right like i could i could say the same thing about black too you know it's not not i'll take a long time to just write down all the pokemon names right but that's not all it is there's so much more to it and i guess the with a game there's ignoring dlc there's a limit you know you you know going in once you get to the end that's it that's that's everything and it doesn't just add on to it whereas with merchandising there's always going to be more right pokemon's never finishing let's be honest you know like there's not reason there's not regional variants that i know of of pokemon black too like there isn't a secret chinese version that had different pokemon in it once you categor catalog it for one you've cataloged it for every catalog like 800 moves the abilities the like but which are the same as the previous game yeah they're same as is a copy and paste we've known they've been copying pacing forever and so has joe doesn't can't be a pain at one point you know that joel works with with data miners right he's not typing all of that yeah yeah i mean like date of mind within minutes of of of getting the game i mean i suppose we could technically hack into somebody's you know the pokemon center's internal merchandise database and they don't have one there there's somebody i'm not done with the night before there's no way that even um the pokemon company international has a list of all of this there's no way they do they'll have a list of who they've approved to make specific things but they don't have a list more recently like oh i i started this job in 2018 and i have documented everything that i've published nobody's paid that much money no do you how do you i mean i i work for a thing that sells cell phones and we do not keep ongoing lists of the cell phones that we used to have once they're obsolete they are purged from the system and we do not care anymore that's what we can actually a good point have you ever have you ever tried to find a list of all the phones yeah and there are so there are fewer phones than pokemon their pokemon merchandise i mean nokia keeps track of all of their models up to a point until they're obsolete yeah i'm sure phone companies keep track of their own models but that's significantly they're only releasing what like five years a year and then you dump them you purge you always got a purge hey i'm just saying there's maybe a market out there for a merch database although probably way too much time and not probably worth any of the effort sounds like you found a new project pkmn cast merch databases exactly what steve needs more things to do i mean um this is off pokemon go live we talked about last week just bringing it up again uh sunday june 6 from 11 to 5 local gibbel will be appearing in the wild uh if you evolve gibble into garchomp it will know earth power uh you'll the scam box is back with 1200 coins 50 ultra balls yep for one dollar you get a exclusive research called just a nibble which is a pretty good title actually three times the catch experience and then incense will last for three hours i don't know why it's not in here i did ask niantic for clarification they did say that guard mega garchomp will not be available during this event boo which is a bummer yeah they said it will be available at a later date uh but i guess and i misspoke last week i made an error last week my brain went to mush which is 90 of the time i said that when you mega evolve your pokemon you get mega energy back when you catch that's that i that that i messed up you get extra candy when you catch so so when you're not candy so okay so like with mega pidgeot you would get bonus candy for catching flying type pokemon because mega pidgeot is flying so when you were catching suabloo instead of three candy you would get four candy so for gibble because gibbel is dragon ground is gibble dragon ground or is gable just dragon i think it's i think it's ground all the way through um you would want to mega evolve altaria so that instead of three candy for gibbel you would get four it is dragon grain jan i don't think we have a ground mega right now low punting is fighting and normal no no so you your only option is alter altaria oh i guess i've got to do that final raid to get the final candy then yeah i don't think i have enough i don't think i care enough but you want you want to stock up on the gimbal kit why i do you know how many gimbal i catch with pine nut berries i have so many candies at the end of it that i do know but the pineapple plus the enter the gives me more candy that i won't use i sit on tons of candy what am i gonna do with it you you don't power it up do you greg that's i also power them up if i'm gonna use them yeah yeah yeah yeah i mean yeah if i get a three star or close to 100 then i might use it to power up and then i'll make that choice but it's that is pretty rare since all my shiny catches are generally bad they're all generally bad cp with bad stars i mean i will power up a shiny but if i don't have a shiny i'll power up a non shiny it's fine i don't whatever as long as it gets me through a raid or a team go rocket battle uh we would probably minnesota people were probably going back to the art park out again we can actually go outside i have 180 mega energy for altaria uh is altaria still in raids yes okay because i need to do one more then i've done none i need one more as well i did the old uh mega houndoom last night gotta make sure that candy is uh stocked up i don't i don't have it in me to hear this again all right uh so there you go if you want to go all out for gable you'll want to have mega altaria as your it doesn't have to be your buddy you just have to mega evolve it so you can just sit there and rot so you'll probably want to do maybe make sure your authority is ready to go for uh for june 6. i think this is going to be the first one i do all six hours like i'm a little bit excited for gimbal guard of not gardevoir would gyarados because doesn't gyarados turn into no it's dark oh it's dark dragon for some reason it's lance lance messes me up every time because the pokemon masters you could do for us oh charizard charizard yeah you could do charizard you could do ampharos yeah so get so many boxes i think though you would maybe want to do altaria though because technically fairies would still be spawning because of the luminous event so you get the bonus from ferry as well oh i thought it was dark that we're doing luminous events because you get you get bonus candy per your type so since your type is dragon fairy which is mega altaria for every table you catch you get the bonus and then for any fairies you catch before or after the event you get the bonus i didn't realize that mega terrier fairy tape yeah but it was still normal no it's it's fairy dragon but it's still bad it's it's not bad because of its typing competitively in vgc it's bad because of its stats it could be better anyways everything could be better but yes you could do charizard and you could do amphoros i can't believe i we i completely forgot about it wait and you want to have a merchandise database yeah so i know when those bandanas were produced okay we will be right back and we'll talk we got to talk about the we got to talk about walmart we'll be right back abundance abundance [Music] [Applause] dance dancers abundance [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so and we are back from our break do you does does scotland have walmart no scotland have targeted i believe no we don't i think target tried to launch in england and didn't really oh no that was best buy not target uh i i believe until two years ago asda which is one of our supermarkets was owned by walmart but they are no longer they're now owned by a random rich person uh that brand recognition random rich it okay this this article makes me mad okay so bobby from our slack sent in an article last week i opted not to read it uh but now we're reading it this week because there's another article that it pairs with very nicely so this is off the verge.com walmart confirms it is indeed still selling pokemon cards and this was the um this was because last week target pulled pokemon out we'll just you know not everyone listens every episode we'll just read what happened here irene actually didn't know this happened i was talking to irene in the car yesterday when we were driving home and she was like wait target doesn't sell pokemon cards anymore so walmart confirmed on an email to the verge on friday that it is not suspending the sale of poke of trading cards including pokemon cards that target recently took off the shelves there have been reports on social media of people seeing signs at walmart stores indicating that the retailer would no longer be selling the cards but that is not the official policy uh the pokemon company has been rushing to produce more cards there have been fights in parking lots and heists and uh it has gotten to the point where target has called it quits posting signs informing customers that pokemon mlb nfl and nba cards the ones the ones that are important cards like let's let's be real it's just baseball um no i think there are a couple basketball cards that are doing well uh in a statement to the verge target has temporarily suspended uh was done because of an abundance abundance of caution for its safety and for its customers walmart did say in fact that they have seen an increased demand for cards and that it was determining what if any changes needed to be met while still keeping everyone safe so far it is unclear if the situation will change for walmart well this week has proved differently well record scratch to this week uh i hate this article because yeah and all of these articles because if you do the command f or i don't know what it is on windows the controller and you type in sports or mlb or baseball nothing comes up because they just assume that it's all pokemon cards which is not and if you watch this video uh it's not pokemon card it's not pokemon cards i i mean there are pokemon cards somewhere in there but yeah all of these men all of these grown baseball hat wearing men baseball hat wearing men are going insane in the walmart okay so this is off kotaku this was sent in by alex uh thank you alex chaos at walmart as people rush to buy pokemon cards again there's not any pokemon cards that i see in this video but it's all part of the problem and the narrative that people are doing because the pokemon card thing is gets more clicks than saying baseball cards i guess yeah the continued charters of pokemon cards again nowhere in this article do they bring up sports cards fueled by the pandemic twitch streams and scalpers have led to a chaotic situation at walmart in pennsylvania the moment the stores open folks began to run to the section of the store where trading cards are sold leading to chaos and one sad night uh this video captured by instagram user and shared by a twitter user around a dozen or more people that can be seen rushing to the entrance of walmart the moment the doors were unlocked at 7am but they were there to buy up the newly stocked pokemon carts again and sports cars sports cards i actually still don't there might be pokemon cards in here i didn't see any and the video is i watched the video i mean it's 34 seconds long so you're like you don't see the whole instance but the one thing you do see so to describe this video to an audio podcast you see you do see somebody filming obviously from the back and then in front of them is probably like maybe about eight to ten people and then two of the people have carts yeah and when they turn the corner to where this the cards are there's a guy who is this is the main thing you see his cart is already full of sports cards yep there's not a single pokemon card in his cart and he continues to put more things in his cart all sports related i don't know what sports i'm assuming baseball um well any of them like baseball basketball and football all have their own cards and there are like two guys out of like the 10 that like are debating whether they want to like grab anything that's like the thing that stood out to me like these two guys that are like that's like me in a situation where i'm just like it's all gone it's there's no point this is why your child would never have gotten a cabbage patch kid i do find this this video odd right because now i'm not i'm not going to justify this and say these people are fine right they're not fine because because i do think this just like imagine spending your life like that but other than other than the fact that this is obviously a pandemic and maybe don't get that close to people i don't actually see anything actively wrong there like there's no there's no fighting there's no threatening there's no grabbing from other people's arms or carts like it's just it's a little bit immature but like it's not like that one that that was a couple of weeks ago with the gun being drawn there's nothing really happening yeah i mean this is not as bad as uh a black friday stampede right there's nobody like in the video granted the video is only 34 seconds that i can see so there could have been grabbing and hustling after but in this they are just scooping up what they can and each one like is stuck with the section that they have and the one guy sort of reaching in and just scooping into his cart at a good old sweeping bases i yeah this reminded me a lot of black friday um but what i don't understand is like walmart literally released a press release we just read it yeah like we know that the tcg situation is bad and this walmart of course there's thousands of walmarts they all have different managers different rules different employees maybe this walmart was short on employees when they opened the doors they know this is an issue and i don't understand how with all the black fridays that america has suffered um how like how is there not form a line stay in that line and then we have a limit here and the limit is two or three or four and then you go down the aisle you grab your five go to register you go down the aisle you like how is this not a just process that we just have especially just now because i don't know if it's the same over in america but like we have quite strict limits as to how many people are allowed in stores just now anyway and so like i don't know maybe i'm just living up a lighter place i don't know like yes you're probably well in fact in fact most of our snow our supermarket supermarkets now actually have traffic lights on the door it's a bit weird but like you know and they stop it when there's too many people in so you could absolutely do like we we've already got things that we're dealing with right now for a different situation yeah i mean so i will say this if that store opening there are 10 people like walmarts are huge even at even at best right now which you know before things change it was 25 capacity well a walmart can hold a thousand people so you're not going to be like these 10 people are over capacity like they're right there at store open now it could be that they didn't expect them to be there and they didn't have the the greeters up front and but it looks like they also went around a way that didn't sort of present the standard uh gates that you have to go through to get into a walmart like it seems like a slightly unusual walmart situation that these all knew about it but who knows who knows what happened on this particular i mean i remember during black fridays and this was probably ten years ago now if not more that best buy would hand out numbers to people and like there was there was no way around it even if you wanted even when the doors open and you rushed they would serve the like a deli they would serve the numbers in the order you're hey we're serving number five yeah like why did you why did number five rush past numbers one through four you're number five um i remember when the wii u came out i was so long ago the lz the story is going to come full circle when the wii u came out i went to that target that the gun was pulled out of last year that was the target i went to i went to that target at 4 00 a.m and i parked in the parking lot no one else was there and then the target opened at seven if i remember correctly and the first other car to pull up was at six and they gave me the look and i gave them the look the look was we're both gonna sit in our car together because it's too cold outside yeah oh yeah yeah and then a third car pulled up at like 20 minutes before store opened and they got out and they stood in line so me and the other guy we looked at each other and he like there was no debate he was like you were here before me so you're gonna be second in line and i was like cool i'm cool with being second i don't need to be first i know they have more than one wii u big assumption but um so the other guy get he's already standing i'm in second third and then in the next 20 minutes we get a line of maybe like 20 people and the target employee opens the door and says okay all that we use are in electronics we're gonna walk you back there like stay in line and there was still there was like still this like has like people still just push past other people like even though the line formed on the outside there was still like this weird rush and it's so frustrating that like grown adults can't operate like school kids and just hey you were sixth in line here why are you pushing to number one like so two people in line if there weren't adults around school kids would behave the exact same way if you've ever had to deal with a number of school kids and you're the only adult and they don't care about you they do the same thing adults don't listen to other adults if there's something that they want like we haven't changed that much yes like oh out of all of these releases whether it's pokemon or tvs or consoles like how have we not as a society figured out the line so we have like the line in america is very sacred like you can ask other countries and they are weirded out about how we strictly are about our lines the thing is is that the companies want the free footage of both here's a product that people want and there's a super demand for it to make people think oh i want to go get this and they also want just the free mention of their store like there really isn't bad publicity here because everybody's going to look at those people and say well they are misbehaving people who are treating this poor store poorly there's very little in the stories that hurt the store so they have very little especially on things like black fridays where they're trying to build up hype for retail for the next month and a half that they like having footage of people rushing into the stores and saying they want these great deals they want those things to happen i i and i totally get that these people are not get are not getting paid enough but also like i have seen it where target employees getting paid like 8.75 which is what target employees get paid in wisconsin which is not the correct wage not is not enough but there is an authority that they have where they s they can say get it in a line stay in a line and people will listen but then there are at least at least i've been in situations where that works it's it is a it is a hit or miss process and we are so i'm gonna say after a year of trying to tell people to comply with mask requirements i do not blame these employees for being like i'm done i'm not even doing this anymore i'm done they don't listen to me about this i don't care about this thing just do it i'm you're paying me yeah i am sure that's a lot barely living wage go at it i don't like it i'm not stocking up i'm not stocking the shelves i'm i don't even want to have to tell you that you some of you aren't wearing masks when you should be we're done like i i think it would be different it would all be different if we didn't have this last year and a half of just pure chaos built into the system of overworked and tired employees and bizarre demand for product it might be like store related too like the seeing this in a walmart being like yep that that seems like walmart customers and then like i feel like people were shocked last week that it was like target it was like oh target that these are target cut like when i went to mitzvah yesterday it was you had to wait in line to get into the store because they were limiting people which is which does not happen at a target or walmart anymore you just walk on in um and they uh you still had to have your mask and everyone had masks everyone waited in the store like there was no commotion the store was relatively empty because they were saying like we only want this many people in but there was like no bad behavior there was no like but you don't get that at like a walmart a walmart is like it's a free-for-all i mean i think it's the they have a built-in they have a built like every store has a built-in reputation about how far you will push it and you know there are definitely targets that people view very differently than other targets like behavior changes being depending on what people have tolerated at that store and i think right or wrong there is a hierarchy of big box stores about what the store looks like and how appropriate it is to behave in those stores i think the reputation of walmart is not great there are websites devoted to how not great walmart is and people will respect and comply to that store based on how they believe that store should be treated so i mean yeah we all say it's not surprising it's a walmart well it's because we all tend to think walmart's garbagey so of course then and i know they're not i know walmart people aren't paid a ton of money just like target people aren't paid a ton of money but target puts in a lot of effort to represent a quote-unquote higher brand than walmart which is like we are here for discounts and they're very different philosophies have lots of opinions about american shops i bet you do and they're all good because america heck yeah we know how to retail and and the intricacies of each different one obviously i do think it's interesting because like we so i i may have seen this on the slack i talked a little bit about how it's we obviously don't have the sports cards because like all of the sports cards that you guys have in america are sports that we don't care about here right and so they don't really exist we have an equivalent thing but it's not something that's a trading card it's not sold in where trading cards are sold and so there are pokemon cards in every shop that i've been in that sell pokemon cards but the demand is is definitely still there they are they are selling out more uh well according to all of the uh people i have talked to in the stores the workers there that could be just based on this these sorts of reporting you never know whether they actually mean that they have seen more people buying pokemon cards just now than than not um who actually knows what these things are like but i've certainly not that these i mean obviously it doesn't really make it's not good comparison because the numbers are so massively different but all of these all of the reporting is coming out of america about these sorts of events i would like to point out al that we do have soccer trading cards that on this website a box is selling for five hundred dollars of all the great soccer stars and there is even a european a euro soccer trading card box coming soon you could get into this you could be the first to bring trading card mania to europe business opportunity for you well-known fan of football soccer sorry if you must well i know okay so there was a point early or earlier this year where english collectors were frustrated that they couldn't get english cards so they started getting japanese cards which were relatively easy to get but were always sold at an upcharge just because of imports and you know very limited where you can get it so for example if i wanted to get like dream league which ended up being our cosmic eclipse um dream league would have been like 40 give or take usd but you would see that a lot of times on amazon or ebay for 50 to 60 and that's with just normal prices but now because so many people had the same i the same thought process of like well if i can't get english cards i'll collect japanese cards yeah it caused the japanese market to go up um so now like that same box of dream league is like 120 usd uh which is like like it and again and i think i said this last week i'll say it this week this is why i'm frustrated with this kotaku article they don't talk about the sports cards being the issue and again if sports cards were gone if they target didn't sell sports cards it would still be slightly harder to find pokemon cards i am not discounting that but these people are putting anything they can in their shelves and if they're getting up at 7 a.m and joe six-pack over here is putting all the baseball cards in his cart they're gonna be like well i know pokemon cards are at least money so i'm gonna put those in my cart yeah and this is what's happening uh that's why it's very easy in my opinion at least in the milwaukee area to find pokemon cards at barnes noble because they don't sell sports cards and so those scalpers resellers are not going there they're going to walmarts and targets and well not targets anymore but anyways it's very frustrating i will say that battle styles has been easier to find as of this whole week you can get i've multiple stores on the internet as of this past week you can get 36 packs of battle styles for 99 which is what it used to be before the pandemic i got vivid voltage for 99. i got cosmic eclipse for 99. i got unbroken bonds for 99. like this is what i normally pay and then because of the pandemic i paid 120 for battle styles before battle styles came out and now i can find battle styles for 99 for 36 packs so it's getting better that to be fair battle styles doesn't have a charizard doesn't have pikachu chilling reigns is coming out in a month doesn't have a charizard doesn't have a pikachu it should be easier to find fads come and go i'm be very curious if the people who are so adamant in getting mick champions path or light darkness ablaze if they're gonna keep doing this because they don't know who an urshifu is they don't know what a calorics is they don't know what a even though chilling rains should have articuno moltre zapdos they're galerian they don't look the same so we'll we'll see when that comes out but this is off bleedingcool.com evolving skies will be coming after chilling rains evolving skies is set to release on august 27th um and the reason i pulled this article is because it talks about what could possibly be in evolving skies based off japanese sets so right now the next set coming out which is very hyped in japan and again i think because so many english people were frustrated that they couldn't get english cards and because of it because it being eevee a lot of people were are importing eevee heroes which is the japanese release set it's evie themed it will feature v v max alternative art of the eeveelutions uh this should be a 40 to 50 box usd um it is going for about 150 usd right now uh which yeah is a lot uh it is uh it is titled evolving skies which is a reference to roaring skies a rayquaza themed set the evolving probably to reference eevee is what bleeding cool is reporting so it is it is very likely that evolving skies will feature pretty much all of the eevee heroes stuff sky street stream is the upcoming rayquaza theme set in japan which will release on july 9th number of cards from this set we will know rayquaza vmax um and they're saying because of sky stream and eevee heroes it's very likely that evolving skies features both of those sets towering perfection which is the sister set to sky stream will focus on doraledon uh which is the towering part they're really going into this name anyways very likely it's very likely that these these are the sets and then matchless fighter silver lance jet black poltergeist is what is making up chilling rain because these japanese sets for those that don't know are normally like 80 to like 110 cards and then an english set is like 280 cards it's it's like three sets normally combined so it's a lot and then in august when evolving skies does come out that will be rotation so we will be getting rid of probably everything sun and moon and it will probably be sword and shield and newer going on and we'll probably learn i'm assuming in august whether actual events are going to come back which i'm going to say probably they're going to try it because they probably want to get worlds done and over with at this point i bet they regret choosing london as as 2020 because uh they just they can't not do it in london now so they just keep changing when london's going to be and i bet they're like we just it's always looking forward to doing this one in london it's like we can't just do one in america yeah uh yeah who i i wouldn't be surprised if they don't even do spectators even in 2022 i mean is it haven't they been coming down on spectators for a while now um yeah at a certain point it was um was it first no it was first dc i think because it was like dc and then it was nashville and then was it back to dc so i remember going to nashville and then i remember going to dc but nashville you had to buy a ticket and the ticket was ten dollars or maybe it was 12 but they would give you booster packs so you would get the ticket and then you would get like three booster packs so you were saving like two dollars on booster packs because yeah three booster packs would be technically 12 the ticket was 10. um but and you could order the ticket ahead of time which was i don't know i don't even remember if they had a dedicated site for it or if it was just on pokemon.com but you tickets didn't sell out right away they sold out within like two weeks but you would go you would buy a ticket and then you would show up you would give your name they would hand you your ticket your three booster packs and you would be in but yeah they were limiting spectators through ticketed prices and i started that right before nashville it was the same as dc um and i think dc might have sold out a little bit quicker but it was never like oh my gosh i sold out in the first day there is there is a risk that that might end if they do let's assume that they have spectators right because let me tell you if the only pokemon world championships to happen in europe doesn't allow spectators i'm sorry i'm rioting right uh writing i'll fight actually i need to try and qualify then i guess um the there is a risk in the if they have spectators it does sell out incredibly quickly because with all of the american ones it's not like oh this might be my only chance to go to it that's a realistic possibility and you have a large population center in around london and you know paris is not far away there's a large selection of france that are very close to london you can get to the train from paris to london in about an hour and a half right these things are incredibly close the the number of people will be like this might be my only chance without having to fly to america that it could sell out incredibly quickly yeah well when you put it that way yeah because they'll be like well i don't know when it's ever going to come back right yeah exactly uh even with canada i remember so many americans being like oh okay i have to get a passport and it's like but canada's like right there but it was organizers it was like a nightmare getting just volunteers that were supposed to be judges it was like a nightmare to get them over into canada it's much more common in europe to have a passport i think um yes it absolutely is i mean i know so there's less that allows me to get into canada if so if they don't want an event to sell out you just have it in hawaii because the flight will deter the two are so many people like a flight to hawaii is just i mean i still want to go hawaii though like i'll go i mean yeah yeah if there's a pokemon then i'll go too but hawaii's beautiful for i mean you have to it's a vacation but it's going to be a vacation new year's where i go i mean it's not that it's obviously not their fault it was a worldwide pandemic but right i felt like the pokemon world events were gaining so much momentum in being yeah something that people wanted to go to every year yeah yeah and early on when i went to my first world championship which was in 2011 or 2012 um it was when the black and white games came out there was really nothing to do you you like at the time it was in it was in san diego and it was in a hotel very nice hotel and you could participate in the last chance qualifier and at that specific event which was not ticketed that last chance qualifier was so big that there was over a thousand people who signed up for last chance qualifier and over 200 people got first round buys like they just couldn't sit that many people so they were like you 200 people you're already making it to round two because we don't have it we don't have a table for you we have no we have no one to sit down um and at the time their pokemon center was so small that people lined up on thursday night all night at like 8 p.m and they went in and it opened at eight and they limited like two items per person and it sold out by like noon and the pokemon center there was closed the rest of the event there it was you couldn't buy anything and that was all there was there was like side tournaments but it was you could watch the matches you could participate in last chance you could participate inside and that was it there was there was all there was to do it was like oh i came all the way out here for like i couldn't even buy anything and it was like there was there's no pokemon go at the time but when i went to the nashville world tournament you could play let's go pikachu let's go eevee early there were side tournaments they did a better job at presenting pokken and tcg and vgc on stage uh they made pokemon go feel like an event while you were down there there was unknown that spelled out i don't know whatever worlds or something uh you could get a meloda they had a huge pokemon center um they just it just and at dc where where greg that was your first one right greg i've never been to worlds oh yeah you didn't go to that world that was that was well um i was going to go to london at the dc one they did everything that nashville did and they did it they added more stuff to it i mean you could play sword and shield for the first time at the dc one so it really felt like yeah london was gonna be like that that first for people being like well i went to nashville i went to dc i i've never left the country but i'm going to leave the country for pokemon um yeah as a side note i think it's i've just remembered they did was it two years ago roughly they had that pop-up pokemon center in london i bet that was a test to see what the demand was like because they were like we might want to do this in london but is there actually demand for it and it it it sold out it was like dead for most of the was it two weeks or something um ironically i was i was in london the day after it's closed and i never go to london it was very annoying it was so late but anyway not a point not not important so yeah i just i that it just that had raised in my mind i wonder if that was a test for whether they wanted to do worlds in london or not but that london store um they were having problems keeping things in stock too yeah and yeah people were lining up very early for it i don't think they initially had a limit on things but like after two hours they did it was like literally on the same day they were like right so a limit of five items and i want to say they also limited like the time you could spend on the store too or something like that because they were just trying to get so many people through there was always a key just always yeah that had um oh you get the the hats the pikachu with the the europe the london hat i don't know what that hat's called oh the um the beefeater's hat yeah yeah which i think i think those those pikachus were going for a decent amount on ebay at the time too uh which is which is all the only reason to have pokemon merch is to to sell it for more money on on ebay we all know that if you ever decide to sell out steve you'll be rich yeah i mean i've been saving pokemon merch for for months for years how do we know how do you even know without a database what your potential return on an investment is that's very true this is very very chilling there's still a bandana i put it up on ebay and say bandana from i don't know when and i don't know where it just got pokemon on it five thousand dollars uh we'll have no pokemon of the week because uh will is not here but i do want al's impressions on pokemon snap oh yeah i've actually not played a huge amount of it um and so i i suspect i'll not have a huge amount interesting i'm not the the i've played it for a few hours um and generally i think it's fun um i don't think it's my kind of game like i will play through it i will spend a ridiculous amount of time playing through all and completing it because that's what i do right i complete things even if i'm not enjoying them but why because i have a lot of bad habits but i don't have that one why if you're not having a good time just leave it luke like i mean alex that's not true i walked out of one oh okay silent hill oh well valid yeah did not like that um but no other than that no of course not why would i have paid my money uh what the reason why i'm very happy i suspect my uh my nephews will enjoy the game very much and that's why i'm glad i bought it it's fine right i get why people like it and i think it's a really good idea and you know let's be honest if they do a third one i will probably buy that as well because i buy all things pokemon uh but i yeah it's maybe it's the sort of thing that once you get um once i get more into it i will probably get hooked i think that's part of my issue is that when i start a game there's like a time period where i f go on and off with it until i actually go right no now i've got it and i'm in and i'm hooked for 40 hours um yeah i think and i don't know i don't know if we mentioned this but i do it's so funny that it took over 20 years for a sequel to a game that people wanted uh for a very long time right like even when pokemon like i don't know when sequel fever ever happened i don't know if like everyone always wants a sequel to something or everyone wants to sequel to a movie or a video game i don't like i was a dumb kid when snap came out and the internet wasn't a thing until several years after so like well for you i was not a dumb kid it was definitely a thing when i was playing snap oh very poor family we can afford the aol dial up at the time greg how did you not have 50 000 free hours from discs just spread her out of your house i mean you look at somebody like him on an aol disc it's free so i i don't know what the i don't know like the opinion at the time was obviously as i got older and everyone wants you know sequels to everything but um they did like the snap just did so many things right that like on the show weeks like weeks and months up to like i don't know if snap's gonna be good it's because they have but to be fair they had a pretty low bar i mean like snap is like a six-hour game it's very short it's very like i wouldn't say it's shallow like it does have replayability there is reasons to go back um but yeah you can find that with any game realistically yeah yeah you know um but the whole like even when they said like oh there's going to be like 200 some pokemon there's 214. uh and a lot of people were like that's not enough but they did make it feel enough just because so many pokemon have incredible personalities and there's this like weird um not a hidden mechanic but there's like this weird like oh it's some of these interactions are very rare and or very specific and when you do those they feel good so i i think that like it is it is pretty much a perfect sequel i don't know i mean there's flaws and there's complaints but i don't know if any other company could have done it better like i just think it's it's really great i it's just it's a very solid to me 60 purchase it does it does feel weird the whole if you've left something for 20 20 years we're now going to to redo it but i wonder whether it's one of these things where they have like this whiteboard somewhere in the pokemon company's headquarters which just has like a list of games that we maybe want to do at some point but they just hadn't found the right partner right because i think because it is bandai namco isn't it and they yeah they did [ __ ] tournament and is that the only pokemon game they've done before snap the two pokemon into an tournament i think so yeah cause there was a there was an interview saying that they were super happy with how they did pokken so they wanted to work with them again i suspect they're quite specific about who they work with and you know that they're not going to waste game freaks time with with a side game right that's not where the money is um and so if they're if they have a very small list of partners that they're willing to work with they're not going to suddenly disrupt one of their ongoing projects to start doing something like this and then once they'd finish broken tournament or dx or whatever the the deal was maybe they have multiple teams in bandai that were working on it but they were then happy with them and like well maybe this is the the time to go for it yeah i had i had somebody come into my twitch chat and say like i wonder when they're gonna make pokken tournament too and i was like well they just finished they just finished pokemon snap yeah well number one they just finished snap number two is the the producer we talked about this on the show like a month ago said that like he would love to do pokken 2 is but it's not his choice it's right the pokemon company's choice and their response was well it's the response was do you think the pokemon snap team worked on pokken tournament and my response was yeah that's why that's why they hired them to do it like i don't think it's the whole team like there are probably specific people on a team that balance fighting mechanics and there are probably specific people on the team that made the backgrounds to poken tournament that have no clue how a fighting mechanic works but it's like very obvious i don't maybe i don't know maybe it's not obvious to me it was obvious that like in interviews when they said we were happy with pokemon tournaments so we're excited to work with them again for new pokemon snap sounds like i don't know probably similar people worked on it and i suspect they're not going to do an another pokemon i mean maybe it'll be a snap type thing where they do it in 20 years but like i don't think they have plans to do it in the next few years because i feel like that's it for pokken and um unites basically taking its place in terms of like like a competitive game yeah yeah exactly they don't want to have too many things going on at once and i don't think they'll want to go these weekends that they pack everything yeah sure sure but but in terms of you got to think about worlds they still have a very limited space in worlds right even if they buy the biggest conference halls they can't suddenly add another game into that and can you imagine they go right we're releasing pokken tournament two no competitive scene for it we're not going to have it at worlds that would sound dreadful i mean they they are in a position where they could add more stuff if they wanted to but they choose not to they could be like hey we're supporting singles but they don't they only support doubles it's just too much you can't you can't support everything at worlds being a physical thing there's just not enough time and you have to support the lead up too right like you have to support people getting points and local tournaments and everything um that's not any shade at pokken like i think pokken surprised everyone with the legs that it had uh but this is what i was saying with the dlc conversation like if they were happy with pokken and now they're happy with new pokemon snap and i i think so like i'm sure that game is selling well and i'm sure uh like i don't see too many negative responses um why would they not want bando nam kai namco bandai to do another game like they're like yeah i think that's exactly what they'll do something else completely different i would love to see them do something different this something completely different and i i think with with now i'm like almost 70 hours in the snap still not done with the pokedex i need three more pokemon still i was like still want i'm still i have 600 of like 800 pictures done like i i want to get all the pictures um and then i look at like a sequel to snap and i think new pokemon snap is probably the best sequel they could have done and then i look at stuff like the mystery dungeon port on switch and it just doesn't feel it's just it's the same and i guess i was so worried with snap that it was going to be like oh yep it's just the same it's just like a six hour you know play at once i guess you could play it twice or three times but they went above and beyond and i kind of wish they would do that for like mystery dungeon or the these other pokemon games like so many people so many people were like i want a remake i want a remake i want a remake and it's like i played it like i've been there i've done maybe you didn't play it and you want a remake but like for the longest time people were like i want diamond pro remix look dude i just like i play diamond and pearl after 10 years i played it again i just played it like last year on my twitch stream like i get i get it so i'm a little hesitant with uh what did what was the word they said like or like perfect remakes or whatever for diamond and pearl or faithful oh faithful yeah i'm a little hesitant with that kind of stuff because it's like new pokemon snap just blew me away and what it did with everything and even with let's go like i don't think let's go pikachu let's go eev is a perfect game but it gosh that game had so much charm and it was just so genuinely fun to play even if it was like easy um it was just like a blast to walk around and see pokemon and um and i want more of that like if i want yeah i do think that the terum faithful remix remake was a mistake on their part but i think i think it is entirely there to tell people we're bringing the we're keeping the catch mechanic we're not we're not doing the let's go pikachu i mean i think that is the entire reason that phrase existed i mean it's a pitfall either way like yeah if you don't say that you're being faithful to the original game you're angering all the people that want their game back if you when you say it you you anger other people who are like well you're gonna make all these horrible choices and i'm gonna have to have 5 billion hms again if you want to tell us information show us the information right they they said this after a trailer right i am 100 certain that the reason was the catch mechanic if you want to show us the catch mechanic shows the catch mechanic in the trailer that you just released right like trying to get across specific information with these phrases that people then take and run with them and go oh well that means we've got the underground and it means we won't have any new pokemon and like you're you're reading too much into it and you know that people read too much into things why are you using vague terms like that it doesn't make any sense right like like diamond pearl introduced the gts is it going to actually have a gps why would like a company who made the gts and pokemon home is making this game why would they duplicate the work you're stuck with you're stuck with ad writers that have to sell a game you're stuck with a trailer that's made with what they have done so far and they could get a team together to make something that looks like it was a finished game when they're nowhere near being finished sure but we're talking about the same company that micromanages the stuff that is released in other games and and they can't even get get the idea of what they actually want to get across in a trailer like i think part i do think part of the issue is we and they announce games too too soon right there's far too much time and especially you know our case making sure i say the name right you know that was specifically way too early why they announced it a year before it comes out i have no idea oh what you know why are you releasing a remake i want a new game there might be some people doing that but like most people would be perfectly happy with just the knowledge of the remakes coming in november and knowing uh there might be something in a year after that we don't need to know that game's coming out in in q1 next year they're they're so bad at gosh now that you they're so bad at just communication like yeah again we say this all the time why are we just getting sword and shield events like why why are we getting the press releases on friday morning when the event starts on thursday night why is there no heads up why did you announce detective pikachu for switch and then show us nothing for over a year why did you announce pokemon sleep maybe again this is me defending sleep trying to defend sleep uh maybe they did plan for it to come out and they can't ship a mobile game without a physical device and it is very hard to make physical devices right now i mean ford can't even get ships for their cars so they can't make cars yeah uh like apple had to do apple the richest company in the world had to delay their iphone a month last year so yes i do think that sleep was probably delayed because of not being able to put out that plus plus thing because they can't make enough of it i mean when they put out pokemon go with the go plus it sold out in like a day because they didn't make enough of them yeah we live in a very complicated advertising world where we are we have companies that have to appease their investors as well as continue people being excited in their brand and one of the best ways for them to do that is announce all of their upcoming plans that people will talk about all of these things and speculate and keep it going in the conversation so it is an advertising technique to be deliberately vague to generate constant talking about the stuff like there's not a way to win advertising apart from getting people to always talk about your product and people are used to in world of kickstarters and delay products that they'll announce it's coming out next year they won't give an end date and it's delayed the delay is part of people's expectations because everything is delayed but the excitement is what they need to get at the times when they have an investor board coming up and they can say look at all the engagement for these two products please keep investing in us yeah but they want it both ways though that's the problem right they want to have this long information of these are the games coming out but they then don't want to actually give you any information about that to stop people getting disappointed right and i don't like to blame the companies too much for people's stupid expectations but they do know that this happens and they could deal with it like we're talking about sleep for example they could easily say oh yeah it is still coming like they put an investor's note or something saying we are still working on this right but the pandemic has delayed it that's easy to do and would stop people going maybe it's been cancelled it's not being cancelled come on of course it's not being counted see the only reason i don't think sleep was canceled or delayed is because what is then select button working on like yeah if it was cancelled or delayed then they need to come out with something else so they can pay their bills i mean i also think they're not i think they are successfully having it both ways sword and shield souls like gangbusters everything sounds like gangbusters sure like they are play they are walking a very fine line and they are walking along again every company is always searching for the line of how how they can build anticipation without it boiling over into resentment and the the bad thing that we as consumers have is we have very few outlets to see what they see like twitter and reddit are not great markers of how people are actually feeling no um the internet in general like isn't a great way to to get how people are are feeling what what is for them is how many times does their name come up in searches how is it trending is it good and and that is what they are going for and sales haven't yeah i mean sales hasn't had didn't dip for sword and shield despite having quote unquote terrible trees and a bad animations like it sold like gangbusters and there was a growing wave of people actively angry at the people who were judging it beforehand and were openly defending their game like that is a win-win-win for a corporation yeah fair stupid it's stupid but it's how it's how the world works right now yeah no you're right you're right talking is still press yeah if it's negative talking like the the number of times i'm not saying i have bought things out of spite but i have gotten close in some cases and it's certainly changed it's maybe pushed me over the edge um just just yeah just despite i bought snap on this bite [Laughter] i'm very happy with snaps it's a very good looking game i'll give you that i mean i i don't want to ever discourage or make it sound like [Music] for me it's frustrating and i think greg sees that firsthand because greg watches my twitch streams but when the the uh where people's minds go with with like with 30 seconds of beta maybe not even beta footage of arceus and people being like this is going to be the greatest game ever it's going to be an mmo it's going to be a million hours long and it's like you got so wild i like how old are you yeah with some wild expectations for 30 seconds of video game footage i also think people don't want that yeah like as much as they say they don't actually want to i want some of it but people just don't have a good people need to learn to manage like it's fun to spend i love speculating about a million things but i've also learned how to be like also this is this is what they gave me do i enjoy it yes or no whether or not it's it's it meant what i thought it should be like i think there's a critical skill that we aren't really teaching actively in this sort of new world of your brand is also your identity like that is the advertising thing is how to manage your own expectations and understand that difference that there there is a line there that you will never cross like you are never going to convince a company to do something that they had already planned on doing two years ago because you're mad about it on twitter right like yeah this is not a thing that's going to happen the bring back national decks didn't do anything and people keep talking about like oh we'll just keep hammering with them and they'll finally listen to an extent like they are listening to are are you gathering enough people that it is a problem and clearly that didn't play out for sword and shield the amount of effect you have on a company about decisions they made at the start of a project which was four years ago is very little yeah yeah i mean there's also like the conversation of like they they have to make money and time is money right like at the end of the day they're a company so there are still people that are like oh well they're eventually going to add the rest of the pokemon to sword and shield why why why like why would they it sold 21 million copies do you think that there's like 20 million people waiting for for [Music] for like kokuna to get added to this game like no like it's like it's just not worth their time and you think anyone who's actually not bought it would still buy it like they're they're still going to have something to complain about and a reason not to buy it at that point like those of us i mean i'm not going to be i'm not going to lie i do wish that all the pokemon were in the game yeah but i bought it anyway yeah because it's a good game i had so much fun in that game it's probably my second most played pokemon game yeah i mean it it's just it's just like the the people that um it's just like the people who want pokemon games to be harder yeah sure like it'd be cool if the game was harder but like is that going to sell five to six million more copies and even if they do go back and add the rest of the pokemon to sword and shield how much time is that cutting off from a new game uh is that like six months of work is that three months of work is that eight months of work like what yeah it's just like you have such a small vocal minority that wants something that like in the long run for the company it's just not worth it it's like they're very good yeah the pokemon company is very good at making a game or a product to appeal to as many people as possible which is what most brands want to do unless you're unless you're a specific luxury brand like um like coach mccoach isn't even a good example but like think of a purse brand like they they don't need the general public they just need a dedicated hardcore fan base because they sell products at a and again coach is not a good example because they're not the most expensive purses but they're pretty pricey you go to target get a purse for 14 you go to coach that same person is going to be 120 right like they don't need a huge audience right pokemon but that's not pokemon they want the biggest audience possible um they don't need they're not selling two hundred dollars of games for you know the hardcore fans to buy it's also hard we don't know what the next generation is like we don't know what their plan is we don't know what their art style is like it's hard to say that like if generation 9 uses the same engine and they're building a different set of pokemon to go into gen 9 which we assume they do it is perhaps possible that they could have have a team to go back and say we're gonna do a final dlc for sword and shield but it's not just updating one game it's it's pulling focus away from the their other products that they want you invested in like for all we know they have all the animations done it's the same engine they're building it for gen 9 they could just dump them into shield right now but there is not that stops so many other aspects of the train and pulls away from where they want to be as a company that even if they have it done marketing and everybody else might say that's great but we can't we have we have to sell copies of the diamond and pearl remakes and then we have to sell copies of arceus and then we have to sell copies of the thing after and there's not a good time for us to just drop a dlc in the middle of everything yeah and and ruin two years of marketing plans yeah and it like even if it is just taking what you already have and putting in a game that's still work there are bugs in storage and shield that would probably only take a couple of days work to fix they're not doing it because it's not worth it to them yeah it's as simple as that all right uh let's wrap up with uh i thought that was a good place to end it uh let's wrap up with question of the week all right question of the week i can't wait to hear what you'll be asking all right oh i'm so good i was on vacation and i added it in this this is a good this goes bad the podcast comes full circle this is from alex what is the weirdest pokemon item you own giant plush butter dish etc wait wait oh weirdest item i own hmm you've got you've got a lot to choose from me welcome to my room oh wow control by a small wire psyduck that rolls is this fast person forward yeah it's from tommy oh it is all right all right an official partner of the pokemon company this is the pokemon romocon battler it does nothing it's never actually worked either probably because the batteries came dead but this is the weirdest thing i don't even know why i have it but it's just weird and it's never done anything everything else for me is plushes really i don't think it's that weird right now but in like 20 years the pokemon typing adventure will probably definitely stand out as a very weird thing that they did yeah i i certainly don't have a huge selection of things and i'm not sure i have anything weird what do you have is a little uh i don't know where's this plaster cast charmander that my older sister made me i it must be like 22 23 years ago and i like i'm not i'm not even kidding like that that is over 20 years old so it's probably like the oldest thing i have um other than i guess the original games okay so i'm pretty sure that this is a knockoff but this is my squirtle white board marker holder it just holds markers for a white board and it's squirtle that squirtle's very thick yeah it's you know he's a wide boy he's a white boy that's got to be protected by whiteboard markers also i'm pretty sure since i got this 15 years ago that these markers are dead and i think it opens um i do have this pikachu salt and pepper shakers no butter dish though uh i have a i have pokemon stamp rollers when that was a thing back in the 90s you just but when i oh i did eventually open it i was like why am i keeping the sealed i'm not going to resell it they're stamp rollers so when i opened it which was maybe a year or two ago the ink was all dried up and stuff because it was like 20 years of collecting dust i guess i do have the um i have our pokemon card uh box here with the stickers from from nick's illustrations of the not pokemon does that count yeah that's a weird item yeah uh everything else i have is action figures i have myself this section this section definitely best to watch on youtube i i suggest for people i have the gill of darkness gamecube that's pretty cool they did a gamecube like exactly official one it's not like reaching no it's it's official yeah it's it was just a silver gamecube that has like oh yeah i remember the top part of it uh it's pretty beat up but yeah al has the pikachu 64. hold on do you have the pikachu n64 with uh with pokemon snap sitting in it there you go so that's probably my most exciting console i've got quite a lot i've got the gameboy and gba it's actually not as expensive as you'd think it's actually pretty good i have two of these oh of darkness custom why do you have two i don't know he was playing planning and sculpting uh days back in the 2000 what was that 2003 for gale of darkness why would i remember why i have two of these from amelia so actually actually the the most likely thing is is i did it on pre-order so they probably had one when i pre-ordered and then when i went to go pick up the game they had it again that's most likely how i ended up with two okay i just i i do expect people to remember these things probably because that's about the only thing i can remember in life like every single thing behind me i can tell you when i got it and how i got it i i used to it's i have now 51 years of collecting stuff and i'm willing myself to forget things because i'm like if i remember how i got them i'm less likely to throw them away so yeah i'm at the point where i'm like i don't remember how i got this check well the the question is like weirdest items uh so yeah for me it's probably salt and pepper shakers maybe an apr i have a i have a pikachu apron that's pretty weird did you buy all those dishes i didn't no i didn't get a bunch of the dishes i thought you got the milk when the stuff came off uh oh yeah i got the milk plate yeah it came with two moo moo bottles and then two moo moo plates and i got two one to keep sealed so i could put it next to my ancient mew and then one to use and using them was the worst thing i could have done because they were poorly made and just hand washing them caused the ink or whatever it's called to come off of it and then at this point it's just no throw in the dishwasher who cares at this point at that point it's the yeah at that point it's done for but i think that was like that was kind of you know somebody could probably say like oh i got the welch's grape uh the jars pokemon was on that yeah and i had those two i have one they probably went through the dishwasher so many times that i i don't know if you could tell their pokemon anymore if it doesn't have to be official stuff i do have my own pokemon card made for me by someone in slack oh nice which is al's zygarde oh that's cool that's tournament isn't it yeah just leave that as well slide that into a deck i mean are they gonna question it somebody might call a judge on you nobody wants i bet you could get through one match with get through one match at least yeah maybe it gets a really cool rare card i don't remember who the owl trainer was was there an out there's got to be an l in all of there is no one i've done this already there's an isn't there's alder uh and there's obviously alistair in the new game there is as far as i know no owl not that i know of i haven't seen because most i mean most of the early games didn't have names on them right i don't think it was gen 3 was it that they actually had names oh yeah yeah they were just like youngster and the names came in the remakes no i think gen 2 had names because they call you maybe it's only when they call you oh okay gentoo then yep yep yeah you're right they did it because they'll be like fire breather richard is calling you and you're blessed yeah no you're right richard stop richard time for this what do you want now buddy uh all right well i think that'll wrap up our show uh will is out of town obviously um but he'll probably be back next week i would imagine as much uh
