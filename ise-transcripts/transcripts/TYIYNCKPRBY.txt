what's up everyone welcome to the 234 episode of the Pokemon podcast it's super effective I'm your host SBJ and we have monster hunter extraordinaire with us will while you were interrupting me while I was trying to gather aptos slivers I hope they're still there for me when I go back they'll be there they'll be there we also have pokemon go addict Travis the yesterday someone tweeted at the three of us saying just two more days than with i canna moat and excited emoji and I know for a fact will because you replied to this person but at least me and will were flabbergasted trying to figure out is there some big trailer that's coming out in two days or are they did I miss something in Pokemon Sun and Moon actually come out in two days whatever the do days and then they say oh the new episode of the podcast I I just couldn't believe that somebody would be so excited that I would have anticipated them up for disappointment now I also far removed from that kind of excitement for the show because I haven't met a consumer of it for uh for years high school yeah more than four years I feel like I get excited for the podcast I listened to every week oh I mean yeah that that's definitely the case but and I get excited to record to the show but cognitively i'm not i'm no longer at a place where i ate associate this thing that we do every Sunday with a thing that people listen to which is probably why I'm so brash about the terrible jokes I think that's fair for our listeners well if you're new listener welcome if you are returning listener or if you're new listener and this applies to both this is our show for you guys we have a little bit of pokemon news we're gonna be talking about the ubs we're going to be talking about the pokemon generation stuff and one or two other things and then actually the generations will probably be the main topic because i feel like we have a lot to say about it even though that's it's probably like eight minutes of footage and then we have our pokemon a week and if we have time maybe we'll squeeze in some emails but our show's been running like two hours long so and which is fine there's no complaints there at all it's just if they run long then it takes me longer to edit and that's that's fine it's all fine everything is fine Travis how was your fine week pretty good like like you intimated at the start of the show now that I have pokemon go I've been playing a lot of it and as i've been playing more of it what I've been surprised to see is that I'm not the only one I thought that Pokemon when Pokemon go became such a huge phenomenon that like many such trends they would die off in a week or two but I see people playing pokemon go still all the time and it's kind of cool I didn't I didn't think it is typically when when you have like and granted not as many people are playing it and you hear people joking like oh you're still playing that game but there's like a lot of people still playing it and i found that kind of surprising and I know I'm not supposed to talk about pokemon in the one but I actually did see video game I'm playing I have a Pokemon ghost story for you as I was out running this morning I came across one of my neighbors and was talking about my trip to Vegas last week and he does like the world championship poker series stuff so he's very familiar with vegas please consistently wearing a baseball hat and sunglasses no but he said oh yeah and when you're in Vegas they have chances if you're still like into pokemon stuff and I was like what's chan cease is that some sort of store or restaurant or something that has like Nintendo theme or something do I need a myself tested when I come back I know but I was like literally like what's chan cease and then I was like oh Chancey you can catch chancy in Pokemon go in Las Vegas when I was like I am the biggest idiot neighbor why's he clearly knew you were into the Pokemon well he's the top pokemon TCG player in Washington DC so and he had just happens to be your neighbor correct interesting all right is she gonna co-host of the show you you know that story I don't think I do oh ya know right I was number one for all that time and then I went to a TCG competition and met this dude who's exactly the same age as me and obviously a better player and I found out his name and it you know then he became the number one player in DC and then I'm like walking my dog down the street and he's like walking up the street and I was like dude with his dog and it's like he's like the other dog than you know he doesn't have a name is Phil he literally lives no he literally lives a hundred feet away from me like not even a mile away a hundred feet away from me we all were left out he also drives the mercury land rover I don't know what you try to stop it's a mercury mariner he doesn't drive one of those either really nice guy I'm sure I'm sure he is I'm sure it is I like to think that there's like a bizarro will living a hundred feet away from you named Phil well um yeah that mattered is my lack of laughter that happened so I the only thing that's been new with me is we just wrapped the first episode of season two of mythical which happened on Tuesday on Twitch do you say wrapped cuz that means completed right well we complete yeah we completed episode one we wrapped against we we wrap that up in a packaged and shipped it so yeah my office is a complete mess because I am actually not in that season but instead will travis's back and Logan is back and Jeff and I which were two characters in season one we are no longer in it for the season we introduced my girlfriend Irene a long old old time Pokemon podcast a purse personnel Aaron who is on first the first / other person besides my voice and erin was was a staple of of it's super effective for probably I want to say like 60 or 70 episodes because he was Aaron is still on Travis when you were still on like you came out you came on round episode 30 but yeah there was some overlap yeah yeah but then we got rid of him yeah but no I errands errands super good friend of mine I've known him probably longer than most people and he moved Texas and so he's still very supportive of of what I do and it's super fective and everything and after he listened to you the first season of mythical which is subtitle dungeons of Dragon i'ts he was like man I really wanted mesas and magic arts know her season two okay ah and he was like man I really want to play DD I really want to do that and Aaron and Irene get along really well then air Irene was a little like intimidated because she did she really wanted to do it too so like having Aaron be there and and them knowing each other as long as as they did I was like well they're both new players D&D Travis and Logan can obviously carry their own weight and I think that those four would be a good pairing for a second season and I think you guys did great for I don't know if you wanted to talk about it Travis but you you are not playing your character you played in in season one you're playing a new person right in season one I played Wendy uh who I really like I really liked playing that character but when the prospect of season two came up and the ID well the eye when it was sort of set up in season one that that these characters would likely be used again and in further seasons um I realized that I would need some time off with Wendy before but because I had sort of envisioned her as someone who just has like a lesson to learn and then the character is kind of done is kind of wrapped up and then that happened by the end of the season so I needed some time to figure out what to do with her so I decided I would play someone else for season two so I'm playing um kind of neither of them are very fun people to hang out with but in opposite ways they're also they're both very domineering people but in very opposite ways wendy is um from the nobility so she is very keen on letting you know she's more important than you is the shorthand but i'm playing baruch this time and i won't do the voice on this show you'll have to you'll have to listen to paper down stairs to get to get the magic herbs what did I say monsters you're like the spj character who just can't get the name right oh yeah mazes and monsters is the anti d ye boi yeah ladies that mazes and magic carps is a pun on anyway baruch is very loud he thinks that everyone loves them um he doesn't like solving problems than any other way than smashing them so it's a very different character than Wendy so that's fun um it's also fun going from the the serious character of season one that Wendy was I mean she was funny too sometimes but to completely a comic relief character so may I ask a fan continuity question at this point so when you introduce the character of baruch you say that he's 14 years old but then go on to say that he went to school with stand and no no no no no dances well the way that you described it you said that you he and stant were like old school chums no and when I was like the school together so that we did not say that at all know when baruch was young he knew stant stant was not young at that point the continuity if you really want to get in the back story the idea is that so Baruch comes from this barbarian clan that has it as a tradition that when their kids turn 14 which Baruch is they go on that they're sent off to live with civilized people for for a period of time so that they can learn why their clan chooses not to do that so they can realize that while there's a lot of there might be riches to be found and there might be a lot of luxury in the civilized world that there's also a lot of harshness and unfairness and then it's up to them to decide if they want to stay or not so that's what Baruch is doing but when Baruch was younger he was very curious of things outside of the clan and he would occasionally see this wandering druid named stant Stan Willa which is logan's character um and when Baruch was a kid he would follow stand around and kind of steal his things thinking Stan didn't notice but Stan just thought it was kind of adorable because this little child thought he was getting away with things so that the connection the house yeah that didn't come across at all and it Lea we didn't get all the way into that yeah but yeah it would literally sounded like you guys went to school together and would like do hijinks like stealing people's breakfast together I can just because we didn't really get into the we haven't gotten into the full back story yet that I just explained but yet so I can see where that misconception would come because I was like so he thought had several adult relationships and he can't be 14 years old now we've we've uh Logan and I have had the conversation of figuring out the friendship ? but doing the two of them yeah yeah so that's that's episode one is in iTunes you can just search for mythical or or mazes of magic harps or dungeons and dragon i'ts yeah any of those terms will get you to that podcast in iTunes or it's on soundcloud or stitcher wherever wherever you listen to podcasts if you want to check that out that's really cool the actual episode starts about 45 minutes in the first 45 minutes are them just making their characters and rolling dice and and stuff like that if you care to watch that live it happens every Tuesday on twitch I think there's more one day there's one week where it's going to be a Wednesday but the schedule for that is on the twitch page twitch TV / PK man castle every Tuesday night 7 p.m. central time we had a pretty good turnout the first night uh-oh and so the reason I brought this up is because my office is a disaster because i have so many monitors and microphones and cables going everywhere because while irene is in it i still need to manage everything through OBS and so I'm like running another monitor and all these cables across the room so my whole that has been my week been a mess but yeah that's that's how we've made that transition to where we are now I think that's good right we made it we're here we're here to bring you some Pokemon news lost my articles here we go all right first bit of news is there is a Pokemon Sun and Moon branded new Nintendo 3ds XL that is going to be coming out before the games yeah where's the date yes that is available on october twenty eighth it is the sole galiyo luna la black edition new Nintendo 3ds that will come out slightly before Pokemon Sun and Moon which is November eighteenth if you forgot it will retail that same cost as other 3d asses at one 9999 United States money and it doesn't come with a copy of the game because why would it because first off it's it's coming up before that and secondly I feel like every special edition nintendo 3ds no longer comes with games like the mana sometimes they do sometimes they don't the but definitely the X&Y special edition 3dsxl s did not come with a copy of the game the animal crossing one did yeah i think the majora's mask one did not come with the copy of the game well maybe it did huh can we talk about how beautiful this new 3ds XL is it's okay i am kind of happy that they're only coming out with one because with x and y they had the blue one and the red one and the red one was obviously superior but now you don't have to make choice of which one you're going to get it's just one I it I have right now the the monster hunter new 3ds and before that I had the special edition yellow Pikachu 3ds and I've seen all the XFC and all the X&Y wands and the black the pokemon black and white ones and everything I am just not a fan of them using the standard PNG art and just throwing it on like Pikachu 3ds is specific for a JPEG right but give me some jpg don't give me any so the pikachu three yes like that design is specific to the 3ds I mean yeah it's just a Pikachu had blown up but like you I couldn't just Google that art and find it like that's so gay leo and luna la is your is what we've seen them in every pose the only difference is it's it's a stencil art but it's the same exact image and they did that with black and white and they did that with x and y where it was just like here's a sec Rob and here's rush Ryman is the same exact thing you would see on bulbapedia same with Eva Thailand exert eNOS I don't know I just want Allah I'm just being I'm just being picky when it comes to designs like I just would prefer something more custom instead of just your standard silhouette well you're right because they the one that they came out with it was Japan only that we really should still be furious that we didn't get was the one that had the artwork of it was the gold 3ds XL or l with the likes of the silhouette of xerneas and then all the trees and then the starters were up in the trees and then the back side had yveltal like over some mountains and that up ryder's now be so beautiful some legit 3s art why don't we get that like I'm looking at the red and blue ones there they're literally the art assets that that Pokemon sends out to everyone up like here's what here's your official PMG of of xerneas this is you people keep buying it every time hey I didn't buy those yeah I actually bought two of those who you bought both of them i bought the red one for myself and the blue one has a gift for someone else i'm not saying that i'm not saying the monster hunter 3 d s is is that great like the mice are newer 3ds is just a close up of some monsters fur and then it's just one of the monster hunter symbols I'm not sure which monster that is but but that gold pokemon 3d ass that one's legit the one we never get so that's coming out if you don't have a new 3ds XL it might be worth upgrading if you like to collect pokemon stuff that the new 3ds doesn't do anything tak right no games use that little nub besides like monster hunter and one other game no no one plays with the 3d on anymore do you play with the 3d on we'll head sometimes sometimes i do sometimes I don't but I do use that little nubby and monster hunter all the time really dia so I originally got um like a shell because when I play monster hunter like my hands cramp it's like one of the game it's not like you're playing pokemon where your you could play pokemon with a des on the table and just kind of you know what I mean yep we're motsognir you're like ripping it and you're holding down multiple buttons and all that stuff so my hands started cramping when I play monster so I got a grip on the grip was nice but it I have smaller hands so I couldn't actually reach the nub comfortably any more so because of that I learned to just use the L button a lot which refocuses the camera behind you so I stopped using the nub completely then fast forward to like two weeks ago where I got a better grip the official monster hunter generations grip and I can't reach the nub again but since I've taught myself how to use the L button I never use the little nubbin II more at all I'm nope I'm not free got that nub free life you say potato I say I don't eat a lot of starches love starch let me tell you what you do let me tell you about some more starch there are new Sun and Moon cards coming to the trading card came that's a bet transition I was waiting for it I had hope I hi ho who's the potato pokemon i would say grubbin no he that's not a vegetable he's I'm sure he's full of starch and electricity I demand a potato pokemon in the lolla region all right a lulling me out and grubbin are the first to Sun and Moon cards Joan for the trading card game in Japan the Sun and Moon collection will be releasing December ninth and it shows the Elhalyn me off which is a dark-type and it shows grubbin which is grass neither have anything's fantastic about them they're just kind of base cards grubbin is shown to move to have the move vice grip so maybe that's something to take that hey possibly that line in the game will know vice grip if you like if you like cards they're coming yeah I'll probably go to a tee TCG pre-release in January just to have fun I like to go to the pre-releases because it's kind of like low commitment and fun yeah worried you're not like completely stressed out and you'll leave with something yo yeah there's nothing more stressful in my life than playing pokemon cards it is stressful because everyone so mean you've never been to an official tournament for pokemon cards Travis don't know I know you don't want to be I i was literally at an eight hour vanguard tournament yesterday and it was so much fun as like just the amount of contrast to a pokemon tournament it was amazing and i was just like this is what TCG's are supposed to be that's the end of my story go on good good I I almost forgot some news here but I pulled it up while you were telling that amazing story alright I guess the big news related to the games this week is the English names for you be 02 ultra beasts were revealed an English trailer featuring you bo2 absorption and you be 02 beauty the two new ultra beasts were revealed in this month's Cora Cora you be absorption which is known as you be expansion in Japan will appear only in Pokemon Sun the extent of its strength is unknown tire body is covered with bulging powerful muscles long mouth is said to be harder than diamonds beauty or zero hbu be 02 beauty same name in japanese will appear in pokemon moon its narrow legs allow it to accelerate with such explosive speed that people claim it can dodge lightning it is said that any Pokemon that sees you be zero to beauty regardless of its own gender will become infatuated with it and lose the will to battle it is undetermined whether it's due to pheromones it exudes or a hypotonic effect induced by its appearance hypnotic hypnotic yep Hypno's yes solid in the trailer you Bo 2 is Dean coming into the ole ola region through a portal in fighting taboo cocoa in front of hawa but they also showed absorption yeah you Bo you said you Bo 2 that's right yes words so as so Andrew Andrew since i which i think is this twitter name but andrew and slag wrecked mentioned that the that so far the three ubs we've seen were based off pests both ubo to look like well you be absorption looks like a mosquito you bo2 looks like what like a roach does look like a cockroach yeah it's got like two long antlers and then the sort of back part looks like a cockroach show yeah and then the first ones more of like a jellyfish and he then linked in our look cuz when you think pests you don't really think of jellyfish right off the bat you think of more like my sir or well it depends on how much you swim in the ocean but I've ever not been able to swim in the ocean because there was a field of jellyfish coming through you'd understand when I think of pests I think of like rats or people that try to talk to me about Game of Thrones yeah but yeah so we heal so he linked an article that it's that pretty much said that I think it was Britain had like a jellyfish problem recently and they kept referring to them as pests and blah blah blah but I guess that's that's kind of this new thing we're more jellyfish oven uh bothering more shorelines I finally read the article once it was like a week or two ago but I don't know it kind of makes sense no one really likes mosquitoes or or roaches or jellyfish-like i can i can think of jellyfish is great and beautiful when it's at a zoo behind glass and they're floating peacefully I probably wouldn't want to swim next to one yeah if you've ever been touched by a Portuguese Man O War you would know what true pain is ok because I don't I guess yeah a lot of people who haven't spent a lot of time around the ocean may not know that jellyfish have like this their their tentacles that fall off of them are like exude I don't know if it's a poison or something but is extremely painful if it touches you in Portuguese man-of-war is the worst and the most painful yeah so prior to the recent trailer that showed these eubie eubie Oh tues off I probably would have been more leaning towards the ultra beast line was maybe something not catchable because pokemon CPI still has not used the word Pokemon when talking about ultra bees correct but when they came through the portal and started to fight pappu cocoa that really solidified to me that oh these are maybe that these are considered quote-unquote legendary beasts like they did with the with like anti and stuff and they're just using the term ultra beast for now but it may like that trailer made it seem like okay like their version exclusive they're probably catchable I was wondering if they are not catchable in the act like bosses in between gyms or something like that oh so like in like getting rid of the gyms having the four islands and then these possibly being like causes i I I wouldn't can I didn't consider getting rid I was just thinking of them like okay you know pokemon X&Y had that long stretch between forget if it's gyms one and two or two and three um but may but like you can imagine if you put like a boss fight in the middle there it wouldn't feel as long of a stretch and i was wondering it and my my thought is that they might put these in between a few gems to spice things up in the same way that they typically do with rival teams have a chunk of the game in between a few of the gyms hmm well or think you're right you think so you don't think i'm sorry do you guys think they're catchable or know that this you're gonna go I don't liked it yeah I don't think they're going to be catchable and I do believe they are part of the story the overall story and and yeah just like how in black and white you had the interlacing of the story between the gyms and you had to do like the the sage battles and stuff as a boss battle between the gyms that this is going to be along those lines alright you'll have to have an ultra beast encounter and get past the encounter before you can move on to whatever your next thing is going to be and I GX I just think I feel like the ultra beasts are somehow extra dimensional so that the rules of the Pokemon world's don't really apply to them and you're actually coming across and into the Pokemon you don't think like d axis is extra dimensional DX s is from space and the axis is a what not a bacteria what are they what about iris what about who is Koopas whole gimmick is it like creates dimensions know who pajama deck is that it bridges time and space but is it that it alleged image it manipulates dimensions it doesn't come from another dimension okay so if if they are Pokemon and they're catchable I mean that's that's what it comes down to write every pokemon is catchable correct and that I would say that's evidence for the theory that they are not catchable because it seems like they would call them pokemon x now if if that were the case also I just want to make the point that you Bo to absorption is extremely unsettling because if it's like 20 mouth because it's like a Johnny Bravo mosquito I don't want yes to they did mention that there are more ultra beasts than this that was because I'm you bo seven that there so that was something that was pointed out in the trailer that I think they said like there could possibly be even more altar abuse or something very generic like that do we wanna do we want to touch on the gender thing there's a gender thing yeah so you bo2 is beauty and then this is regardless of its own gender regardless of its own gender will become and flash to it it will become infatuated with it and will lose any Pokemon that sees it regardless of its gender so male Pokemon female Pokemon i'm assuming genderless pokemon us do you think that well I'm going to say I think that's cool do you think that's a response to the amount of gender talk that's kind of happened in 2015 2016 or that there is some real lower behind that because if there's lore behind that they're going to be looking at more so something in myth or in legends that would state that you know anything is I just use something like Medusa no matter whatever whatever legend or store you're told if you look at medusa you become stone right I wouldn't I do not think that this is an attempt to be progressive or anything like that in fact it's if that were the case it would be incredibly strange to try to be progressive about gender by saying here here is a monster that all monsters are attracted silly that is that doesn't mean anything well that's all I wanted to bring it up I I think it's more your second idea that it's probably pulling from some mythology that doesn't come immediately to the top of my head but just this general idea of I guess that beauty is thinking about it in as this like Platonic ideal that there is some concept of pure beauty of a beauty that's undeniable regardless of your proclivities I think is maybe the idea that they're they're going for I don't think this is progressive is yeah we're like some attempted inclusivity because if it were it would be very strange i would say in any way that it's would refer possibly to the six different types of love that were expressed in greek ancient greek which of course everyone is familiar with yeah i mean i have my ancient greek book right in front of me yet your eros your go far you love your arrows felis or whatever the brothers one is Athena Athena one that's a god that's a great name dropped after two there's the agape I get you gotta got back you been good you pit that's one you got them all right let's put everyone out of their misery there is eros which is physical i would say three is pretty good for someone who has like said oh you are training library pathology except you studied philosophy which is highly based in knowledge of Greek society anyways eros being physical only filia which is a very strong friendship ludus which is playful or flirting agape which is your overall love for Humanity in the world pragma which is love that has lasted for a long time and this one's hard to pronounce but latia which is the love you feel for yourself have a lot of that you could say that you bo2 inspires a feeling of filia which would make you not want to attack it is a type of love okay no that's awesome I'm that that sounds better than anything we've had up to this point bizarre gender politics hmm yeah so yeah there you go there's your to you bees they're the same in some aspect I I still it's it's clear that pole has shown us very specific things of the ubs with the intention that there is just not enough information the words they've chosen the the images they've shown even the trailer is very specific to enough to cause speculation but not enough to validate anyone speculation yeah it's clear that we're all very confused about what the UVs are and what they mean I think that's what's clear I think the extra dimensional aspect that you mentioned that definitely gets conjured up in my mind as well when I think of these things comes from the naming convention of you bo1 you bo to it sounds like some sort of government classification that's hidden away in an archive that that that we weren't supposed to know about like some sort of x-files thing like warehouse 13 sure I'm not that show is that that show we're like it's just a big warehouse and I find like spooky things every week it basically yes that sounds like a good job I think I think my mom like that show I loved that show it was also in the same universe as shoot what's the town it was like the town on the west coast Eureka or whatever yeah and those two shows with the bomb all right well transitions exist I don't have a good one but when we come back we're going to be talking about the to YouTube trailers for pokemon not trailers shorts animated shorts for pokemon generation and we are back from our break to talk about Pokemon generations Hank this is a yeah 18 episodes so if you don't know what this is Pokemon generations looks back at each generation of the Pokemon video game series diving into the stories of the games more deeply and getting to know the characters and the Pokemon better visit each region from Kanto to Kalos to relive the world of Pokemon like never before Pokemon generations will consist of 18 episodes each running between three and five minutes in length the first two episodes while launched September 16th which was couple days ago and then they show just this trailer that looked very much in the style of pokemon origins and yeah we have the first two trailers now I think all of us have watched them i watch them twice i watch them actually right before we recorded just the first two episodes first two episodes yes I don't know if there's like an overarching premise here let me just read what the youtube comment says or the YouTube synopsis so all these are on YouTube they're on you can just go to youtube.com slash Pokemon it's on the official page the first episode which is titled the adventure is from Viridian Forest to terminus cave see the Pokemon world as never before oh this is where i read this is where i read it put my generation revisits each generation of Pokemon video game to shed new light and some new light on some timeless moments from early day in canto to the splendor of the Kalos region go behind the scenes and witness Pokemon history with new eyes these bites I'd adventures are three to five minutes song will be released every week through December 23rd so it will end on december twenty third there you go so I feel like that's two a week yeah probably because it's about 9 mm its not 80s december four weeks weeks to christmas i guess what do i need to start my christmas shopping now four weeks in december four weeks let's talk about math here november in four weeks in october oh that's 16 i guess no that's 12 that's 12 and we still have a to each in Friday's left in September that's 14 and then your did you already count the weeks into December that this will be because it doesn't end December first or whatever yeah yeah I can't discount Reuters so that must mean that there are two there would be two episodes not release at that schedule so I'm assuming that what wonder what two weeks out of the next 14 will have an extra episode well no also keep in mind so right we just counted 14 weeks plus the two that have already aired that's so that brings us up to 16 so then yeah one week has or two weeks have two extra episode sure why not yeah that's what I said okay so the first episode already has 3.5 million views on YouTube I think that's the only way to watch it it opens with version of pokemon red very similar to how pokemon origins opened and then right away as every great trainer does encounters a pikachu doesn't do any damage just goes to the item slot right away selects the poké ball catches the Pikachu and that is when we transition into the animation which is very good animation and we also see a not a new design but a differently drawn Pikachu a different interpretation yes it has a little chubbier I think it's a bit more rounder of a head yeah a bit more mouse than other yeah that's a great way to describe late it I liked this episode a lot I think I'll just give the part of the basic premise and we can break that down it starts with an unknown trainer and really besides the initial picking up the pokeball the trainer has nothing to do with this story and I like that we see the pikachu go from region to region few places that we've all been throughout the series and battled pokemon in a way we haven't seen really happen and the tray how does the trailer the trailer ends with Pikachu attacking the Pikachu encountering as I guard correct and so when it's back with the trainer at that point yeah sigh guard complete form which hasn't been really been shown before right we see use i guard power up and then the the camera pans into the sky and it comes down and says Pokemon generation I would I would actually say that this would this is more of an episode 0 in my eyes this is just a you would show this to maybe somebody who is very high on Pokemon go but hasn't played pokemon since the 90s you would show this to somebody who you know is maybe currently playing red or blue on their iPhone or something or their computer because they jailbroke it or whatever obviously this is fanfare for us being poked for loving Pokemon but there's no real story here it's more of a remember everything you've done up to this point I think that's a very good way to describe almost with taking away the second comment I think that's a very good way to describe both of the episodes seem we've seen so far they're pretty light on story they're more like little vistas into the Pokemon world and nods to things we know from the games but and I would say the underlying subtext of the first one the adventure is the reminder that right you well I mean technically you couldn't have but that Pikachu that you caught in Viridian Forest you could have had with you through all of this time and is now you know like up to the point of x and y you could have had that Pikachu with you battling by your side the entire time right through all the generations I think if you break down the battles more clearly those battles themselves are telling individual stories I think encountering a Pikachu when we all played red and blue for the first time I think was probably the most exciting thing we we had right because when you got the game you new kind of which starter you were getting the excitement wasn't there it was oh my god i want bubble sir well no one said that oh my god i want Charmander oh my god i want squirtle bright and then to me i remember very distinctly playing these games and going the first Pokemon I want to catch is Pikachu right because the anime was such a big crutch at the time of like the anime is what how I discovered Pokemon yeah but you also used a master ball on a gold duck so he has attempted univer universalize your experience and I also started with pokemon yellow so I started with a Pikachu okay so no I do I do recognize that because Pikachu is the first but if memory serves is the first Pokemon that you encounter that has a low encounter rate because it's hard to find the EF I think back I think that all the pokemon you see up to that point are pretty easy to find like they have a look at the lowest probably like a thirty percent chance of seeing them or something so it's it's like they're pretty easy to find and then I think doesn't Pikachu have like a five percent chance and really in forest yeah that's the first time you find them is in Viridian Forest and yeah it's the hardest one to find in that area i think you have wheedle and PG and Caterpie which are all very easy to find then you have guna and Metapod which are slightly harder to find and then you have piqued so it's your first experience with rarity in the game really yeah we move on to the second battle which is in johto we see Pikachu battling three Wooper I don't know why Pikachu is battling three Wooper and since 11 / that's all right but we see Pikachu Thunder shock these Wooper and the expression on Pikachu's faces that didn't work these Wooper on water waters week to electricity again I think that is a throwback of our first experience in johto and really seeing new types that was the first time we saw if i'm not mistaken a water ground I water type that is not weak to electric yes I believe that the looper is that first of that correct we move on to everyone's favorite generation 3 where we see a wait wait wait wait wait wait you're skipping something important after the loopers strike back at Pikachu and he's falling off the tree he bounces off of lugia yeah this vigeous you that I think it's funny because they use they use the legendary pokemon as the transition so from Caterpie to Wooper we see a zapdos from looper to Vigoroth rasiya lugia it's just that's how they cleverly hid transitions which i think is fine we go to the Hoenn weather Institute we see Pikachu battling of Vigoroth I don't have much memory with with generation 3 I played it after generation 4 so I'm not when I when I see the weather Institute that doesn't strike back any memories to me they used latios and latias as the transition there I don't know if you guys have anything to say about that i mean i thought that i thought it was a fine segment i just i don't know where the weather Institute ranks on people's familiarity with Joe with Owen well but that was Howard's thing it was that it was the introduction introduction of weather conditions there you go cool yeah complete with my is my friend gave me a level 100 figure off not a lie so that makes complete sense now generation three introduced whether the weather Institute Institute we moved to Sinnoh at snow temple at snow point temple we see Picchu fighting everyone's favorite is a propo pass or is it nosepass think it was provo passed so let them like a bunch of the big mustache yeah yeah yeah ah we see Picchu fighting that and then we see a regigigas come up for the transition again I haven't played generation for since it came out ah I don't remember the importance of snow point temple well don't ask me because okay Travis anything a long time ago I remember the area I don't have a recollection of where it comes in the story or what generation serves but I remember the I remember the whole like snowy region at the North Asano and all that sort of thing though is Sinha the one with the volcano with the grass that you go through and you can pick up the ash is that sin oh that is Hoenn that is Hoenn huh okay sinnoh has um a mount core and a big mountain in the middle got it well it's no point is where you would encounter Reggie giggles so I there you go is is is that is that regigigas ha's temple is out I never got the reggies originally in the game I wasn't sure if you're supposed to get all three Reggie's go there you have to bring them okay so you do have to get yeah you do have to get the three Reggie's and then bring them to get regigigas right yeah okay see what we all solve this together ah regigigas transitions into you Nova we see Pikachu acting as Nathan Drake here struggling across this desert region I was this is my favorite part of the whole thing at like the fact that he had t got to the sandy part of the floor and fell through yeah it was how you navigated that the is it relic castles that would have the relic the relic temple I thought yeah that I love that throwback or that whenever call out to that yeah I think to me it reminds me of how frustrating that temple that that falling through the sand was it is real like castle oh is it okay we see the trainer in the background this is the first time the trainer appears since the Caterpie fight if i'm not mistaken and again the there's no focus on the trainer which I like a lot because I think it's supposed I'm strongly in favor of this trailer invoking your experiences with the game because I've given we're all saying like we remember this this is what we remember about this generation like for me falling through the hole in the temple and then going back up and then accidentally falling through it again kind of frustrating and so that's what this part of the the episode reminded me of Pikachu get sucked into the sand falls through and encounters of volcarona one of wills favorite Pokemon Europe I was so happy one of the coolest battle sequences here is when Pikachu slams onto the floor and uses it as a shield protecting itself from what I believe to be is a heat wave volt tackles volcarona into the slab and then we see a thunderous out of item we're now Thunder it is a landorus as the transition into terminus cave for the Kalos region and we see the mine cart and a noi fern chasing that I have all Pokemon noivern is the the generation 6 choice I guess that's okay it's of the pseudo legendary dragon dealy maybe sorry I sneezed in the lobby goodra um Adam you myself cuz I sneezed I like Noah and I think know everyone's a really cool pokemon yeah he's okay it's an Auvergne one of the few Pokemon that can learn boom burst well but also know everne is the one that you encounter in that series of caves around where zygarde is so I mean as much as I like Kalos I wouldn't say that the minecart area of Kalos was the part of the game that stood out to me well because you're not a completionist and you didn't have to walk all of those different paths and figure out that stupid maze to try to get to every different area in that tea I feel like the the part that really screams Kalos was the tower the wannabe Eiffel Tower but that's just me finally the NOI fern disappears and we transition to the trainer and Pikachu walking up to a giant crater in the ground we see zygarde complete form they're powering up pushing back Pikachu and then floating into the sky which then brings us to the generation title screen hard to tell what's region it was floating out of but presumably the lolla given that so i guard complete or one hundred percent or whatever it's called is in sun and moon and write x and y well i don't think so because the transition is the trainer and Pikachu get off of the mine cart and that's where zygarde complete is and then air into the air out of the ground yeah the clouds come in really fast but it there was no bodies of water around the area but again that's just thick I don't know what this the exact scale was for that um yeah I liked I liked the first trailer I like that I keep calling him trailers because they're so short I liked the first episode a lot I think that it really hit home on a lot of those generations in the fields especially for me canto joto do you guys have any other final thoughts on that or anything else you wanted to mention I feel like I talked a lot but I was just trying to break down the trailer I'm just very happy to have seen volcarona featured you to really like these things don't you yes oh no I think they're animated beautifully and they're done very well but i don't really like i guess and i might have talked about this on the show before but I'm not the type of Pokemon player that can name all of the gym leaders and basically any generation I'm not the type of person who I bet I bet you could do generation one and don't try me I'm not the type of person who gets immersed in the environments of the Pokemon world there are certain fictional worlds that I love and I love learning more about and exploring but Maya even though Pokemon is my favorite game series by a mile my enjoyment of it has never been very closely tied to locality or those sort of like spatial experiences or or even really the lure of the of the series it's not something that's grabbed me I when I have been grabbed by things about Pokemon other than character designs the Pokemon designs the the gameplay it's the game stories when they aren't interesting like generation 5 was not the sort of background information or the or the setting which kind of both of these shorts have been focused on sort of just adding to the lore of the universe so it's it's not really I think they're both pretty and they're both well done but but neither of them have a have a story to tell and that's kind of disappointing to me did you did you see the four episodes of pokemon origins Travis yeah and it what how would you compare that series to what you've seen so far of generations it's been quite a while but i liked origins and besides I like you you probably haven't seen an anime episode in a while yeah that's fair i mean i've caught a few here there i mean i've seen a few of the newest incarnation and i saw a few i mean pretty much every incarnation of the show I've seen an episode or two okay all right yeah I think I think that's an interesting dynamic where the lower the animation of the stories is something that Travis obviously just said that is not his draw whereas will and you can correct me if I'm wrong you definitely like the stories that are being told especially if you look at black and white black and white 2 which are the most story oriented games you really enjoyed that and I don't but I'm a big fan of the lower and why Pokemon exists in the world and relate to each other I just don't care for the 4story in my Pokemon journey if that makes any sense I think it's interesting because both of us made a pretty strong distinction and I realized you were asking will a question here i am talking with i think it's interesting that we both made the clear distinction between lower and story in the in the pokemon games because i think there is a pretty clear one between the actual story of the game and then digging into the places and how they fit with each other i like the story meet me too and I don't really like the war although ask me about Elder Scrolls lore and I'll be sitting there for 20 minutes about Bowie Thea Prince of plots yeah and like I don't know how did for some people they might not know the difference between story and lower which is kind of hard to break down trying to think of like Duke clear-cut examples that would be very easy to point out I think story is Harry Potter diff a story is Harry Potter defeating the villains in each book the lore is knowing about like knowing the potion recipes knowing knowing the things that Harry learns in herbology class are knowing about all the beasts in the Harry Potter world story is the main narrative focus of a fiction than the lore is the background information that makes that story feel real because it's placed in a real world and that's especially true of fantasy fiction because it's the world sort of needs to prove itself as opposed to fiction that's more grounded in the real world typically doesn't have lore because it doesn't need to establish the world we already live in right I would I would say that we had we had this we have a debate in our slack community last week about some what about this and I don't know how I got started but my complaint with the story in in x and y is that the the story in x and y is a saving the world story it is that this cannon is going to go off and blow up the world and your job is to stop it and I didn't let I liked x and y a lot I hated that aspect of it when I started playing red and blue when I got into Pokemon it wasn't because I wanted to save the world it was because I wanted to be a pokemon trainer and I felt like red and blue and even gold and silver in a couple other games it felt like my journey of becoming a pokemon trainer and being quote unquote the best there ever was because when I beat the champion at the end I felt like I am the best pokemon trainer in this game I didn't sign up to save the world there are plenty of other games that do the save the world mechanic like every final fantasy or and final fantasy is a great example you buy a final fantasy you know what you're getting every time you're getting save the world story every single time you're giving a scene where the two main characters lean across a railing and do fake laughs for about 60 seconds haha so when I buy a pokemon game I want that experience I want the experience of I signed up to be the best pokemon trainer and I didn't sign up for a save the world story not my problem with x and y was that the story leaned into the lore in a way I didn't like the story was saying that the only reason this cannon works is because we need an exert yes or we need a eva tile to power the cabin I didn't play both so i'm i'm pretty sure they just flip the two Pokemon and I didn't like that because I feel like most legendary Pokemon don't need story to make their lower interesting like Mewtwo isn't mentioned really at all in the first game besides subtle hansen like the diary that you find on the the island or in this in the the self tower but when you discover Mewtwo and when you find me too and whether you catch it or not because you wasted your master bar earlier Mewtwo still has a lot of lore where when you think of Eva telling xerneas it's hard to think about them without going well they were used in a tool for the cannon which was part of the story which just leaves a bad taste in my mouth oh come on what you're talking about so I know I I I get it I you know I I can understand that having a Pokemon that's supposed to be this way quite literally legendary creature that represents either life or death depending on which one we're talking about so firmly connected to this particular crisis plot seems to my devalue its status as the sarnia says the bringer of life if it if you're only connection with it if it has a connection to the story that is only solving the plot that it's sort of cheapens that i don't really feel that effect because i feel like the Pokemon games do enough to show that these Pokemon have sort of other responsibilities or that they are the their relationship to you even if you catch them is like they've been doing a lot of stuff before you caught them especially with like Jenna for with Arceus creating all of the the lake spirits and dialga and palkia and Garrett Tina um but to your another point Pokemon has the same narrative confines that a lot of sequels tend to have are a lot of series with multiple sequels where you are always expected to be at least as the climax is always expected to be at least as threatening as the previous entry in the series if not more so they got to keep upping the ante right and you can only and it just becomes sort of a you you can only go so far as saving the world all right that you sort of get to the logical conclusion of saving the world than every entry and and Pokemon already basically got there in gen 3 but I feel like gin for didn't have it save the world yeah i mean you're talking about a villainous team that's trying to like reset the creation of the universe or whatever team galactic was trying to do with the yoga and palkia which I win cuz I'm sad that you remembered that finally that they wanted to create a new universe yes but I mean that was not saving the world great you're using through the own universe go there have fun Ops will be here training mukilteo and I would can I would consider that a similarly existential threat personally while while i do get that the it does send me that that sequels tend to have that narrative restriction not really restriction because they can do whatever they want but expectation is probably a better word on because i would like each entry to sort of speak for itself um i don't get too disappointed with it as long as what they do with saving the world is interesting and I think generations five and six have both had interesting stories um and I guess generation if I wasn't really about saving the world but it was about saving the the current World Order of the relationship between trainers in Pokemon and I guess that team plasma wanted to take over the world not necessarily destroy it but I'm getting off on a tangent I think it just de values your your legendary Pokemon to put them in a situation where you have to catch them like in black and white you could not catch Zekrom arrest ram and so you're you're giving everyone a legendary pokemon for free ultimately and you're not giving them the opportunity or the challenge to get what is considered the top tier pokemon like getting to mu2 or finding Articuno or going out of your way to find Zapdos or Agra small trace kind of existed known really when other way for that but those pokemon all felt exciting captured they didn't feel like they were just randomly placed like the journey to get to them I think at least to me was was extremely memorable I i can see that point but i think i can see that the mystique gets a little broken when it is a scripted element of the plot that you catch these pokemon but i feel like that same mystique is broken in all of those cases when then a battle later you're instructing you to to use psychic like it if this book Mon truly is this high and mighty world controlling Beast then why does it listen to you because of Randall own i guess that's and I guess that's why the Laura that Pokemon games have always not really taken me because there's so many inconsistencies so many strange things about how they interact with the mechanics of the game that it doesn't feel like it's even trying it feels like half of the time it's trying to be a real world and then half of the time it's trying to be like tongue in cheek it's like yeah I'll start that it stuns again part of the time is trying to be a real world that you believe in and I can respect that if you want to do that then do it well then don't go and bend the rules of your world just because the mechanics dictate it and don't bend the rules of the world just to like make a meanie joke as a reference to the real world which that bothers me in the Pokemon series because it it's not consistent with what they're trying to do that there's too many breaches and in the world building for it for me to really care about it and I think chief among those are the very mechanics of the game that I love like I am not really going to buy that these places are real places if you know these Pokemon that they talk about as gods are just like in my pocket currently yeah I it doesn't feel real that was my other complaint with the the X&Y story was we have this powerful Pokemon powering this cannon that can destroy the world when it's already been established in the lore that a pokemon like Mewtwo or a pokemon like d-axis could easily do that on their own because they are that strong really that strong do you think the axis could destroy the world yes I think I think enough Pokemon could stop deoxys from destroying the world but it is clearly proven in the generation six story that a 10 year old trainer could stop a giant cannon d axis is not that strong not even half of its forms or even meta totally so I will take this back one step to ultra beasts and the island challenges and all of that biz I think that in doing that the pokemon company or Game Freak is trying to restore some of the mystique to the games because once again we're entering into a game and we don't know what to expect right there's no more expectation of legendary trios I think that's going out the window so you're not going into the game looking for the predefined ok what is the legendary trio for this one which is the equivalent of the legendary birds and all that kind of stuff so it's a it's a whole new world that we're going into and hopefully we will be as delighted as we were for red and blue yeah maybe I'm just worried that these ultra beasts are purposely based off of the characters we've seen and that that's weird i don't know like the only other comparison is Mewtwo is kind of related to Giovanni but not really anything like cousins like you can take or leave that like like in the very first movie how with Giovanni tried to control Mewtwo with the equipment and the reason that Mewtwo is in cerulean cave is because it ran away and that's where it ended up going and like Giovanni was the one that paid to have me to create it if I'm not mistaken he was the one that paid the scientist ryan movie definitely yes yeah i think that is also in the game I don't know that's all right I can't can't I think it's also in the game because I feel like Sony's don't ask me something about the moon dis give me the Elder Scrolls that I can get you enhancer let's talk about the second trailer in this title the chase it has two points it's an episode not a trail yeah I get nice and short the second short I keep saying trailer I feel like it's leading up to a bigger story it has 2.2 million views which doesn't make any sense how does it have 1.3 million less when these came out on the same day I don't understand maybe people saw episode 1 and thought I don't want any more of this yeah maybe also episode 2 was uploaded before episode 1 by like 10 seconds why would you watch episode 2 first if you saw the title episode 2 that's maybe I the description is detective looker of the international police uncovers critical information in the hunt for Team Rocket boss Giovanni ah walk through this again I don't think really much happens it starts with looker and some mustache police officer with no name I talking about getting Giovanni and breaking down the game corner yeah game corner obviously Team Rocket's hideout in in red and blue ah they don't make it clearer why they break down the game corner besides to get cos knock their business their base of operation bring them when they freed the Pokemon that we're being held there against their will but let me gamble don't kick me out there are see there's no sense at all there unsure where Giovanni is this is the first literal minute of the episode is talking about they broke down the game corner they still can't find Giovanni they do the weakest plot point of Giovanni's men will not tell us where Giovanni is they are extremely loyal let's move on it's just four minutes of looker talking to people who look like SWAT team people and then walking into an empty room touching an explosion and then you see Giovanni for a like a hot second and then it's over yeah actually on explosion well there the debris from an explosion I'm sorry so hey it's I've been recording this for already almost an hour and a half i'm sorry i didn't get every word perfect for you will so we went from we don't know where Giovanni is do we broke down the game corner to we're interrogating Giovanni's men they're super loyal they won't tell us where Giovanni is to all of a sudden we know Giovanni is now the gym leader yeah there's just some dude who says he's been spotted in the Viridian gym like the first he's like at a computer and he like turns around like I just got an electronic mail this is the word i got an AOL instant message indicating that Giovanni's in fact in the range in which is still worth minute and 20 seconds ever oh how did we get here they put a bunch of spotlights on Veridian gym and they bring out a SWAT team and they there they state that Giovanni is a powerful pokemon trainer so we need 50-plus riot gear security guards to come here um to break into his gym full SWAT team I this doesn't work like bringing the SWAT team is ridiculous I guess what it all it shows I feel like what they're trying to convey is Giovanni is extremely powerful and that's why we need this many men but at the same time it references that two people have beaten Giovanni up to this point red and blue ash and Gary whatever you want to call it those are the two people all right I promise you anytime you're making a raid on a mob bosses location it's gonna be a lot of SWAT police officers involved I think it's cool that they have an Arcanine they have a machamp that are you know ready to swat it up with the SWAT team the best thing about either of these shorts is the part where i'm a champ full-on cool a man's through so they spread out into three groups we know in the pokemon lore that the gym leaders are pretty much the people in charge of the town that's at least how its kind of broken down in the hierarchy of the Pokemon world I don't understand how looker who is a detective is the worst detective in the entire world to not know that Giovanni is a gym leader and whether or not it's kept secret how at this point has he been a gym leader so long that he has recently or only given out two badges I find it hard to believe that the Elite Four has existed as long as they have and the only way to get the Elite Four is they have eight badges and recently two people have beaten Giovanni and that's how we suddenly know the history of the Viridian gym clearly has been a mystery up to this point i will give you some small i will call them apologies because yes the program was not perfect but one thing that looker does comment on arriving at the Viridian gym is the Viridian Jim was supposed to be closed so potentially potentially Giovanni went in and wasn't really supposed to be the gym leader or he had basically been neglecting his duties for a long time and only appeared there as a response to his initial encounter with red and now wanted to challenge this up-and-coming pokemon trainer which had who had impressed him so much with his Pokemon training capabilities she will offer him a badge but Steve is kind of right just in terms of how it comes off though because the it's not like because you do get the one line from luckier that establishes like this place was supposed to be closed but it almost seems like he's saying like I didn't know this place was open not it how you know like not no one knew this place was open it's like so I think Steve is I think you're both right in the sense that they do include that line to give you the context but but I I'm with Steve and that it does kind of feel like you know someone is like mr. president it turns according to these records el chapo has been president of Juarez route has been mayor of Juarez for the past 40 years oh like I get it doesn't like it the like the way the rest of the series sets up gym leaders and Jim's is that their this institution that's perpetually around like like how did people even go to the kantou elite four if the viridian gems are spent like there's no discussion of that like it that none of the details like really fit when you think right much about them anywhere on a break it's okay even if Giovanni standing there when you get there even if Giovanni closed the gym clearly he was a gym leader prior to the gym closing like you just don't become a gym leader instantly close it and then prevent everyone from getting to the Elite Four like other people have gotten to the Elite Four before you that's a dark story that remains to be told how the once good-hearted and Noble Giovanni was turned to darkness this is a raid I understand the raid aspect of things this is a public building I believe I feel like gyms are public buildings like libraries are courthouses little IMCA let's just melt the wall with an Arcanine and then let's also kool-aid man through the other wall but gosh forbid we don't damage the front door we just break the locking kick it open and looker the only one without body armor a riot shield is the first to go in which I can't boggles my mind it's just silly well that trench coat he wears is made from nibble nibble snarf skin so i will say those immune to bombs the ah the hack on might really cool nice little some a feature know what Magnemite hacking it how come okay it didn't hack anything it's like it's a little bit just right yeah overcharged is fried fried the the the the glass doors that didn't get damaged but good old Machamp smile at through a wall and good luck good-o arcanine just melting and let's go back to the we need a cannon to destroy the entire world our k9 melted pure concrete with a flamethrower yeah but then he was real tired after that Z I don't know talk about a real strong that's all I'm saying I mean how many PP tis flamethrower have he melted the concrete to the point where the concrete was dripping molten lava in defense of pokémons continuity on that specific aspect I would say that the Pokemon world does seem like some sort of strange post-scarcity utopia where healthcare is is free no one is poor thank you like Pokemon do all of the work so healthcare is free no one is poor and law enforcement of dubious quality so looker with a growlithe behind him unclear if that is indeed his pokemon or not encounters the gym arena of giovanni discovers giovanni's not there there is like some black goop on the ground and they call that an explosion I'm not I'm unclear to be like it's supposed to be like the charred floor from an explosion of like a pokemon trainer battle or yeah yeah that bring okay I mean that brings up the questions of do we replace the floor every time there's pokemon battle it just makes it unclear of how these arenas are so scarcity economy they can afford it this is how everyone stays in business battles break down people have worked because they need to replace the floor Machamp comes running through the door with a big ol smile on his face because he's happy he kool aid man through a wall um I don't think the floor was ruined I think there was like God remains you know of the battle over she just need somebody to like sleep all right the janitor the janitor gets in business we go to this we go to this pan out to Giovanni looking back at viridian city saying that you know Team Rocket will never be defeated Team Rocket will never fall we get a close up on his evil eyes he puts a fedora on and then he walks away proof that he is evil it it's just the overall I get it they have three to five minutes I don't really understand what that episode is trying to accomplish well it answers the question of like you continue playing pokemon red or blue but Giovanni never gets caught so it kind of like fills in why it wasn't Giovanni club because he got away so there you go well now that questions answered that mystery has been solved I mean if anything it makes it just makes Giovanni look strong everybody is strong no I and I like that I if there's any characters in the Pokemon universe that I want to know more about it is the gym leaders and the bike shop people what's their deal why do they put these exorbitant prices on things if they're just gonna give them away what is going on there yeah I mean it makes Giovanni look good if your look or was first introduced in generation five if i'm not mistaken oh you are mistaken flee engine for it is sling platinum he's at least in platinum if not Jennifer generally yeah he's definitely before ngentot you think platinum though but now base series done for all I'll look up if it's I think you're right I think I think I think he might be just in diamond and pearl briefly and then expanded upon in platinum but I look at well what does what does looker do in the games break it down for me well he's just moves the plot along he is an investigator for an international policing organization so people like he asks you as a strong trainer to help him in his investigations so he's based busy he is the postgame in black and white definitely yeah that's the last one I heard about him the most was post game black and white turns out he's not in the base games of diamond and pearl he's introduced in pokemon platinum is there anything specific he's notable in platinum for oh he's he's like investigating team galactic okay based on his investigations in this three to five minutes I'm still going with the the the thought that he is one of the worst detectives ever he does act as a bit of a comic relief character and a lot of instances alright well let's take a comical relief break do a little music when we come back we'll do our pokemon of the week and there's one small news articles

reinvent our different email so yeah let me know but yeah uh for everyone who has signed up thank you so much I appreciate it the two bit of Pokemon news we missed is the pokemon gold plus is out now it is available it is probably extremely hard to find I did order one on amazon my amazon delivery date is this wednesday so i should be getting it this week and I do plan on doing a review of it and taking it out and making it work so I've done some Pokemon reviews up to this point if you go over to our YouTube page youtube com such pkmn cast and you can see some of those but I'll give next week we'll talk more about the Pokemon go plus the other bit of news I forgot is that the kora kora besides revealing new ultra bees they also revealed Rock ruffs evolution and it looks like rock rough will evolve into a Pokemon called lugar en lugar egan gurren lagann ha Golu Gringer gun wait what are we talking about aa giant robot anime obviously wait we're not talking we're not i would get zoned out cuz it wasn't important to me we're not why didn't we start talking about gurren lagann because rock roughs evolution is called like loup-garou gan something okay now now we're all on the same planet got it I its appearance will change whether it during the day or whether it involves at night this is they're not too different pokemon I think of this more as meowstic the male and female meowstic are the same they just look different and this is going to be the case for rock refs evolution the name I can't say it says that this article this is actually from Nintendo life because they they stole the not stole but they took the images off therapy and savvy and therapy got them from Cora Cora but they say a safe bet that they will have differences in combat the magazine has skis at these that it would reveal a secret about rock rough that is GERD along with the ax Lolan region starters while this could be a secret rowlett Lytton and populo could also have separate forms based on time of evolution this interesting this is still unsure v i'm going to say the Sun evolution because it has a lot of orange around it a lot of yellow around it is they let their werewolves so if you listen to my packs episode I found some wikipedia articles and I based rock rough off a certain type of dog that is known to get rabies very easily it's also one of the dogs that are very similar to have werewolf or wolf like characteristics but yes these uh I would say that the Sun evolution is quote unquote more of a wolf and the moon evolution which if you look at the scans it has a lot of blue around it a lot of darker colors which makes me think that this is obviously the night evolution is more of a werewolf looking Pokemon they look very different a lot like the meowstic line where male and female look pretty different but not much else is said about those so it is looga Rugen loup-garou gan i'm assuming it's something off likin that i think something yeah along those lines I midday form the Sun form learns a move called excel rock which is a new move and the midnight form learns a move called counter so they will have different moves depending on which evolution you have and correct me if I'm wrong Travis but the meowstic lines have different moves whether it's male or female that is correct they have different completely different move sets yep there we go for those who like wolves or werewolves your Pokemon are now here I'm and I I would safely as I would bet that the the the day for ms ground something but the the night for my feel like is dark round or ground dark wasn't rock rough rock type yeah sorry but there's lots rock typing rock I don't know I thought ground these rocks are ours it's called ground rough ground rough good old ground rough okay let's move into our pokemon of the week I'm gonna throw it right to Travis again we can mix it up this time I guess cuz there was a Vigoroth in the generation short we're doing slacking slaking how we're going to pronounce it I feel like we've done this before but that's alright slaking is such good stats it must be amazing well there's one large problem and that's its ability truant truant is an ability that only slacking possesses where your second fourth cetera turns having slacking out it will instead of doing the move you instruct it to use do nothing as it is loafing around so every other move you make will not actually do anything so even though it has great stats very difficult to utilize because you can't really afford a Pokemon that can only attack every other turn however we're still going to try to make it work it's worth noting that you can still switch out after you make that first attack so perhaps these legs are so high yeah it's a pace that's an incredibly high because its ability is probably uh actually slow start might be even well no I would say that true and is worse than slow start so I'm also to as a point of correction it's pre evolution slakoth Ozma has truant that's true yeah I guess you're right Vigoroth is the only one in the one that doesn't have it I forgot it let slakoth also had it um i think what i was saying yeah so you can still switch out after that first turn so if you use an attack your first turn you can switch to another pokemon and then not really how the disadvantage of having to wait for the truant turn but that might require you to make a switch once lacking is the best pokemon have out it's kind of predictable that you're not going to want to do nothing so it you could be easily punished for it so you're putting a bad spot so there's two schools of thought for your first move you're definitely going to want a very strong normal type move for same type attack bonus first school of thought is the one that is a little trickier with your ability which is giga impact the thought here is if i'm not going to be able to attack my second turn at all i don't care about the fact that giga impact needs to recharge so i can i'm only attacking every other turn anyway I might as well use giga impact very strong move can take out Pokemon it can take out a whole bunch of Pokemon even defensive ones in like two hits very strong problem is you can't switch out after you do that and do the thing I just talked about so you're what you gain in base power you lose in some versatility the safer option although I think it's a lot less fun a lot less cool if you wanted to be safe and be able to switch out after you use your main same type attack bonus move you'll go with return or frustration depending on if you want your slacking to like you or not that also requires you if you're not r ng Eng or playing on a simulator to actually make your slacking love you um good luck with that you hurt your second move so we kind of are going a similar line as we went with Oh what even was our book my other week last time was small X no yes nice yeah I thought what's neural x I think we did something after that anyway we talked before about a Pokemon with a pretty poor move pool that was normal type it was something that had guts it what are we talked about that had guts Raticate radical a here we are so uh slacking is on the other side of Radek a raticate was trouble because um it didn't really have any good type coverage to be able to deal with things that normal types typically can't but luckily with slacking you do have access to earthquake that covers rock type and steel type two types that you would only be not very effective against with your normal type moves and you actually still have an option for ghost types you actually have two options one is pursuit if you're trying to take out the trickier ghost types that are more sweeper oriented that are trying to get in and get out and deal some damage or if you want to just deal with the bulkier ones um the bulkier ghosts you can do night / night / is a little more generally effective so that's probably what you'll want to go with although pursuit can be quite effective against certain opponents that you anticipate will switch out a lot or certain team compositions that require that for your last move and this is where I'm going to deviate a little bit from convention I'm gonna say slack off you're not slack off nights for devolution I'm gonna say slack off it's the move that recovers your health by 50% I realize that it's kind of risky given that you you're essentially going three turns if it you know if if you attack your first turn slack off your second that's 3 full turns that you're not dealing damage to your opponent and that's kind of rough and you're just taking three hits and it might not end up helping you but if you can get a slack off to go off when you expect your opponent to switch that can be very beneficial um that's why I recommend it over something like encore or something that might be typically recommended which which is your you know another good option as well i also don't i'm not very compelled by the fast by investing your own nature and v's into speed need granted a hundred speed is nothing to you know nothing to be ashamed of that it's going to let speed a lot of Pokemon especially with investment but you have so much HP already in your in your base pool that it makes a lot more sense to me to invest your Eevee's in HP it means you might be able to survive a few more hits to to have more than one turn of action just makes a little more sense to me i'm sure people you know the people who make the the canonical move sets and things on places like smogon know better than me but um if you're trying to run slaking you don't really care what those people think anyway what if you can I can I throw a wrench in your mood set mm-hmm if it was a double battle what if you use one of those moves at switch abilities with slaking yeah you can do that um here is is that is is wasting that turn valuable enough because of how high slaking stats are not really wasting but taking it you could do some interesting things with it um there there's two um I guess there's one main problem i see first you have to run a pokemon i guess it's two problems first you have to run a pokemon the nose skill swap generally and if memory serves there aren't a lot of great pokemon that know it I'm looking actually no it's it's a TM so apparently a lot of book one can get it so scratch that problem I was in the main problem is that even if your skill swapping you still end up with a Pokemon that has truant because you just swapped it on to your other Pokemon and has about this alternative yeah egregious and have cough egregious attack you're slacking or have slacking touch cough cough Rodriguez the other way around yeah what if that's oh yeah I see what you're saying if this is a silly question if I skill swap with slacking and I now have through it looks like let's just say my Pikachu skill swap Dino Pikachu can't learn it ah and then I bring back my Pikachu and then I bring my Pikachu back out does he still have truant or just bringing him back just set his ability the ability would be reset you get your original ability back there you go it if you can pull it off and you can get those set up turns going it can be a very powerful effect what I would say more often than not you're going in to run into trouble getting that setup there's too many you know there's pokemon with taunt or there's heck you're talking about double battles so a fake-out is a very real thing that's just going to happen and ruin your dreams the stars would have to align for that first turn to go the way you want it to I would say it's very cool if you can pull it off though I don't think I'd really had anything more for the single set other than to say I would invest your Eevee's into HP and attack and then give it something like an adamant nature I mean I like on paper blacking looks great because of how high it's HP is and how high its attack is and it's almost like you could take a turn off because one you could survive that turn into because you can pretty much one shot a lot of things I feel mm-hmm but you run into problems because um okay so let's just go through the scenario even with the fast variant of slacking where you're investing in speed a lot of Pokemon better played competitively have speed stats that are above 100 100 is not a terrible speed but it's the same speed as like new and you don't typically think of you as like a hyper-fast pokemon in the and in the scheme of things so you're going to be out sped by a lot of stuff I see it you use your giga impact your first turn you might even want you probably even one hit KO a pokemon with it the next pokemon comes in it's something fast like let's just say it's um you know they switch into um yanmega yeah yeah I was trying to think of something that's super effective against because they're obviously going to go into like something with a fight they they switch into hey Molly yeah they switch into Hitmonlee they use whatever fighting move they have in the move set i jus I think that's Japan hi jump kick is very good this isn't like eighty percent and then it also has a recoil I believe it's ninety percent it does not have recoil if you lose the ninety percent then you take half of your damage or if you it deals if this is you take damage right correct um but it has such high base power that it still gets used um on money sweepers because they don't care that much about their health total because they get one shot anyway anyway sidetrack um so him only uses a high jump kick takes you down probably more than halfway it's super effective and then it out speeds you on the next turn and high jump kicks you anyway so it's after all of that pomp and circumstance of having this pokemon with an incredibly high attack you end up it ends up beat just being a one-for-one trade granted if you didn't run giga impact and ran return or something you could switch out that second turn but then you're giving your your opponent a free turn to deal damage to whatever pokemon you switch into so it's sort of a bad situation either way but i thought i think that that was one of your best analysis you've done thanks you've walked through some situations i like that flaking slacking however you want to call it during most of the day slacking law lols around and sleeps it is considered the laziest pokemon but even when it's lounging it is saving energy it can exert a lot of power by releasing built up energy at once it can regain loss energy through the use of its former signature move slack off slacking lives in force where it feeds on grass and ripen fruit that falls from trees it only moves around when there's no food within its reach to eat and if you get a shiny one it is like a blue no it's more like an orange back he kind of has like a light blue main i would say i and the shiny one is more of an orange main and the nose is a little more pink hitmonlee is actually slower than slacking I just I don't know that out I just found that out I've find that hard to believe but ok the trivia here is slacking has a lot of similarities to regigigas they're both normal type Pokemon they both have hidden hindering abilities truant and slow start they have the highest attack based stats out of all normal type Pokemon they also have the same base stat totals outside of legendary Pokemon and mega evolution slacking has the highest base that total of all Pokemon even surpassing pseudo legendary pokemon x 70 points in a double or triple battles 1 can nullify slacking strewn ability with either skill swap or gastro acid several trainers in pokemon emerald uses power including Norman during the players rematches with them the final boss in Pokemon Colosseum also did the same tactic without truants liking can make full use of its impressive stats this can be done in single this can also be done in single battles using a contact move with a pokemon like cough egregious that's that abilities mummy and in pre-alpha sketches it depicts this pokemon as a a pre-alpha sketch depicts a Pokemon that bears a striking resemblance to slacking obviously this is an audio podcast but oh yeah it does look like it looks like a look I just love the experience of half of the listener doesn't hearing Steve not even not even try to provide a visual description of what he's seeing and just going oh yeah so it's a real rudimentary drive it really is a really rough drawing it's really cute though so slacking is in this article with tyranitar and so you see it looks like it was sketched on like a napkin but you see it looks like a little baby kangaskhan it's obviously supposed to be tyranitar shooting a little fire out of his mouth and you slee see what like slacking except it looks like a bear with a baseball cap on and it says nothing is known about the first Pokemon Godzilla night it may have been a fire-type pokemon as shown as its breathing fire it's as its name implies is local likely based on Godzilla Godzilla night notably shares a resemblance to one of the fake pokemon toys Joan within the pocket monster mega Magna Man Man manga I can't feel like I'm saying here you go manga manga vol.1 the Japanese name of tyranitar is also based on Godzilla nothing is nothing is known about the second Pokemon gorilla marila mo gorilla mo it could be a reference to a character uh from a game called a pink anyways it's supposed to resemble yeah so the the default name in a knot earthbound but I believe the first mother game the default player named players name was nin 10 got it which is like a joke about Nintendo being in the same way that in earthbound or mother to the default name is ness which is like a reference to that yeah I know oh gosh I feel really silly i have it made me have it backwards i forget which but i think that's how it works I didn't think that neces name was based off the Nintendo internet entertainment system because I guess that makes sense it all comes full circle I resembles a Nintendo character Donkey Kong gorilla mo could also be based off King Kong later generations may have have included a paste Pokemon blacking is the most notable that shares physical traits with gorilla mo there you go I guess that makes sense though like in if you go back to the drawing it kind of looks like Godzilla verse on the ape bear with a baseball cap on definitely a baseball cap attention definitely a baseball cap no doubt in my mind that's not a baseball cap man all these like old sketches of Pokemon look incredible I love I love everything about this bowl pedia page I think we have to do a whole episode on it Lord everything here is fantastic oh not the jigglypuff thing that's just sad Jigglypuff drawing is really disturbing yeah that Charles are drawings really legit though this is this is making terrible podcasting material well I think that wraps up our episode hopefully you
