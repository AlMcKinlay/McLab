what's up everyone welcome to the (0:23 - 0:29)
513th episode of the pokemon podcast (0:26 - 0:31)
it's super effective i'm your host steve (0:29 - 0:34)
with me is greg hello (0:31 - 0:37)
i thought we would skip the 13th episode (0:34 - 0:40)
because 13 is an unlucky number and it (0:37 - 0:41)
was just friday the 13th it was just (0:40 - 0:45)
friday which was may 13th and it's 513 (0:41 - 0:47)
which is may 13th the conspiracy was (0:45 - 0:48)
right (0:47 - 0:50)
this is the worst arg i've ever played (0:48 - 0:52)
all of the signs point (0:50 - 0:55)
to us potentially getting lunch this (0:52 - 0:56)
week (0:55 - 0:58)
maybe (0:56 - 1:00)
also i was wearing a striped shirt while (0:58 - 1:02)
running a game yesterday (1:00 - 1:04)
through discord (1:02 - 1:06)
and i forgot that wearing a striped (1:04 - 1:08)
shirt on video is an (1:06 - 1:10)
awful idea and i kept distracting myself (1:08 - 1:13)
with how bad i was strobing (1:10 - 1:14)
so (1:13 - 1:17)
this is true this is true (1:14 - 1:21)
will here i have also made a discovery (1:17 - 1:24)
which i can only phrase this way (1:21 - 1:25)
i can watch (1:24 - 1:28)
peanut the squirrel on tick-tock do the (1:25 - 1:29)
same thing (1:28 - 1:31)
infinitely (1:29 - 1:34)
if i have to see either one of you have (1:31 - 1:37)
some sort of random pokemon team or just (1:34 - 1:40)
a pokemon above your head generator go (1:37 - 1:43)
one more time and then you get angry (1:40 - 1:45)
about it i'm gonna unfollow you and find (1:43 - 1:46)
a way to block you so you're not even (1:45 - 1:49)
suggested as one of my videos (1:46 - 1:52)
stop the madness (1:49 - 1:54)
the madness will never stop it's like i (1:52 - 1:56)
rolled the dice and i got angry because (1:54 - 1:58)
it was number four (1:56 - 2:01)
well four didn't pass (1:58 - 2:03)

tick tock content take time doesn't like (2:03 - 2:06)
you if you're not if you're not (2:04 - 2:08)

it's a great shirt it's really great the (4:26 - 4:30)
confusing thing and why i wanted to talk (4:28 - 4:32)
about this is why (4:30 - 4:34)
what what happened here why is it on (4:32 - 4:37)
niantic supply website when the first (4:34 - 4:40)
three shirts were on pokemon center.com (4:37 - 4:42)
exclusively uh because of the great big (4:40 - 4:44)
riff between pokemon center dot com and (4:42 - 4:46)
niantic have you not been following the (4:44 - 4:48)
gossip mm-hmm (4:46 - 4:50)
what's the gossip (4:48 - 4:52)
they're not friends anymore they're not (4:50 - 4:53)
friends anymore (4:52 - 4:56)
uh niantic it's cheaper to do things (4:53 - 4:58)
in-house you don't have to pay right (4:56 - 5:00)
they have their own website now they got (4:58 - 5:01)
their own merchandise (5:00 - 5:02)
they're cutting out the middleman (5:01 - 5:04)
they're streaming (5:02 - 5:06)
there's no way they were not getting a (5:04 - 5:10)
cut from the pokemon center yeah (5:06 - 5:10)
pokemon center is doing that 20 percent (5:11 - 5:16)
apple tax yeah now they got no no they (5:13 - 5:18)
get the all the profit for themselves (5:16 - 5:20)
there is no way they're going to sell (5:18 - 5:22)
the same amount of shirts on their (5:20 - 5:24)
website that no one has heard of (5:22 - 5:25)
versus (5:24 - 5:28)
who wants a pokemon go fest shirt unless (5:25 - 5:30)
you're a pokemon go and i don't even (5:28 - 5:33)
want one they sent it i played that game (5:30 - 5:36)
they sent it via pokemon go app like all (5:33 - 5:37)
those people saw it how many of those (5:36 - 5:40)
people actually go to pokemon center dot (5:37 - 5:42)
com who even care to go to pokemon (5:40 - 5:43)
that's right (5:42 - 5:44)
i got it i got it i don't know i go to (5:43 - 5:47)
pokemon center.com every day it's yours (5:44 - 5:50)
we got one out of three on this call i (5:47 - 5:52)
got an email from niantic and i looked (5:50 - 5:53)
at it and i didn't delete it immediately (5:52 - 5:55)
they are very successful in their (5:53 - 5:57)
marketing they are it's a good looking (5:55 - 5:59)
shirt it's (5:57 - 6:02)
it's kind of cute it's what the 25 bucks (5:59 - 6:05)
is is makes it less cute i mean the go (6:02 - 6:07)
fest shirts have typically been (6:05 - 6:10)
nice shirts true yeah (6:07 - 6:11)
look i mean t-shirts are just (6:10 - 6:14)
twenty-five dollars that the pokemon go (6:11 - 6:18)
is competing with pride t-shirt season (6:14 - 6:19)
and so far (6:18 - 6:22)
they have not won whereas the star wars (6:19 - 6:24)
rebel pride t-shirt from target (6:22 - 6:26)
absolutely did win (6:24 - 6:29)
if this was a gay pokemon go shirt then (6:26 - 6:33)
we're talking but you can't enter june (6:29 - 6:33)
pride season (6:34 - 6:39)
capital rainbow dollar month (6:36 - 6:42)
with this 25 mesh shirt i mean it's cute (6:39 - 6:45)
but it's not gay so i'm out i mean you (6:42 - 6:46)
know they already lost in my house (6:45 - 6:48)
because i spent 90 on gay yarn and i was (6:46 - 6:50)
like i didn't really need this yarn but (6:48 - 6:52)
it was gay it was rainbow i mean i spent (6:50 - 6:54)
got to get it i well i was gonna spend (6:52 - 6:57)
38 dollars at gay target but i had (6:54 - 6:59)
actually earned credit so i got one of (6:57 - 7:00)
my shirts for free and the other only (6:59 - 7:03)
paid 19 for and that is a bargain and (7:00 - 7:04)
it's (7:03 - 7:06)
based off of homosexuality unlike the (7:04 - 7:09)
pokemon go fest 2022 shirt here which is (7:06 - 7:12)
not based off of that and it's month (7:09 - 7:13)
of june (7:12 - 7:15)
true so (7:13 - 7:17)
you lose what you've been doing for me (7:15 - 7:19)
lately niantic to earn my dollars my (7:17 - 7:21)
rainbow dollars yeah friends it's (7:19 - 7:23)
rainbow dollar think of it as a you know (7:21 - 7:26)
a july shirt just early nah (7:23 - 7:28)
if it's going to be july shirt it needs (7:26 - 7:31)
to come in july and july is clearly gay (7:28 - 7:33)
wrath month so it needs to be angry (7:31 - 7:35)
rainbows yes they are going to clear (7:33 - 7:37)
until august (7:35 - 7:40)
yeah this is the normally go fest is in (7:37 - 7:42)
july i think anyways (7:40 - 7:45)
uh speaking of this week and not july (7:42 - 7:49)
and not june but may pokemon goes water (7:45 - 7:51)
festival returns (7:49 - 7:53)
bringing the debut of lapras wearing a (7:51 - 7:55)
scarf (7:53 - 7:59)
uh jupiter and araquinid (7:55 - 8:02)
uh for whatever reason uh (7:59 - 8:04)
i can't (8:02 - 8:07)
this didn't happen with egypt slash (8:04 - 8:09)
where people are like well i don't think (8:07 - 8:10)
no one knows how to say aegislash (8:09 - 8:12)
everyone says ageslash doesn't matter it (8:10 - 8:14)
doesn't matter it doesn't matter but (8:12 - 8:16)
with jupiter (8:14 - 8:18)
people were very upset that youtubers (8:16 - 8:20)
were saying jupiter because they're like (8:18 - 8:24)
no you're dumb it's dew plus spider dew (8:20 - 8:25)
spider (8:24 - 8:27)
but for whatever reason jupiter is (8:25 - 8:28)
jupiter it's supposed to rhyme with (8:27 - 8:30)
rhyme with jupiter (8:28 - 8:32)
but they're they're it's a good argument (8:30 - 8:35)
it is dew plus spider right so not do (8:32 - 8:37)
spider they want them to say deep (8:35 - 8:40)
hydride dupont yeah (8:37 - 8:42)
awful that's an atrocity of the mouth (8:40 - 8:45)
and the tongue no (8:42 - 8:48)
it is stupider for for what it's worth (8:45 - 8:50)
but why would it be jupiter (8:48 - 8:53)
i don't know why it would or would not (8:50 - 8:54)
let (8:53 - 8:57)
have the logic fundamentally friends (8:54 - 8:59)
words have pronunciation of words have (8:57 - 9:01)
no moral value and as long as you (8:59 - 9:03)
understand the meaning that's conveyed (9:01 - 9:05)
we're done (9:03 - 9:07)
good enough but i say jupiter you don't (9:05 - 9:09)
get this you don't understand that it's (9:07 - 9:11)
a dewy spider (9:09 - 9:13)
that's you're not supposed to you're (9:11 - 9:14)
supposed to understand it's a pokemon (9:13 - 9:17)
named jupiter (9:14 - 9:17)
i mean there is no squirrel in squirtle (9:17 - 9:23)
because is not based on a squirrel (9:20 - 9:26)
of course it is it's tail says otherwise (9:23 - 9:28)
that it's a squirrel that's a turtle (9:26 - 9:30)
that squirts with this is everybody (9:28 - 9:32)
saying that we established eight years (9:30 - 9:34)
ago clearly have never seen a squirrel (9:32 - 9:37)
sometimes don't even look like that i (9:34 - 9:40)
watch peanut the squirrel every day (9:37 - 9:42)
it doesn't have the tail the tail is (9:40 - 9:45)
long and fluffy (9:42 - 9:45)
it comes out it's a paddle like a (9:45 - 9:49)
squirrel squirrel tip (9:47 - 9:51)
there's not a squirrel (9:49 - 9:53)
it's the madness all right now we're (9:51 - 9:54)
going to spend the uh next 45 minutes (9:53 - 9:58)
talking about pokemon pronunciations (9:54 - 9:58)
there's no app for jupiter (9:59 - 10:04)
yeah you gotta go to you gotta go to the (10:02 - 10:06)
episode of the anime where this is it (10:04 - 10:07)
i'm a person of the people it is a (10:06 - 10:08)
history (10:07 - 10:10)
pretty certain that jupiter does not (10:08 - 10:13)
even have eight legs (10:10 - 10:14)
so (10:13 - 10:16)
uh how is it a spider (10:14 - 10:19)
it has (10:16 - 10:21)
no it's got two that are holding the (10:19 - 10:22)
water bubble on its head and then you've (10:21 - 10:23)
got three that are holding the water (10:22 - 10:25)
bubble on its head and three on the (10:23 - 10:27)
ground so it's six legs which is (10:25 - 10:29)
insectoid (10:27 - 10:31)
not arachnid (10:29 - 10:32)
but it's got two body segments like a (10:31 - 10:34)
spider (10:32 - 10:34)
the (10:34 - 10:36)
i got two body seconds like a spider (10:34 - 10:39)
nobody calls me a spider i mean not to (10:36 - 10:41)
your face because you don't want to get (10:39 - 10:43)
bit and thrown into a web the legendary (10:41 - 10:46)
pokemon tapu finney makes its pokemon go (10:43 - 10:48)
debut appearing in raids (10:46 - 10:51)
uh the lapras wearing a scarf can be (10:48 - 10:52)
shiny (10:51 - 10:55)
uh 50 candy to evolve jupiter into (10:52 - 10:56)
araquin it (10:55 - 10:58)
for the first time ever you'll be able (10:56 - 11:00)
to encounter shiny binacle literally no (10:58 - 11:03)
one is excited by knackle (11:00 - 11:05)
knuckle (11:03 - 11:07)
oh yeah sure (11:05 - 11:10)
i haven't heard that one say it out loud (11:07 - 11:12)
but i believe there's a friend with (11:10 - 11:13)
tabernacle so you're supposed to think (11:12 - 11:15)
of a choir when you look at the two (11:13 - 11:17)
heads singing so it's binding what (11:15 - 11:19)
really (11:17 - 11:20)
no (11:19 - 11:23)
no it's binary it's binary barnacle it's (11:20 - 11:25)
a binary barnacle (11:23 - 11:27)
no it's just no it's a (11:25 - 11:30)
binary bad pokemon (11:27 - 11:32)
i mean this is the cinderache debate (11:30 - 11:35)
right like (11:32 - 11:35)
uh this is the piccolo debate it's all (11:38 - 11:44)
why a scarf (11:42 - 11:45)
i don't understand why it's wearing a (11:44 - 11:48)
scarf because it's very fashionable (11:45 - 11:50)
celebrating (11:48 - 11:52)
what it's not it's not a warm scarf it's (11:50 - 11:54)
one of those fashion scarves like steve (11:52 - 11:56)
thinks that he can pull off (11:54 - 11:59)
no it's it's literally a bow tie yeah (11:56 - 12:01)
but then why do they call it a scarf (11:59 - 12:03)
i i don't know (12:01 - 12:04)
was it a cravat (12:03 - 12:06)
no i don't know that lily looks like a (12:04 - 12:09)
bow tie it's like a watery bow tie (12:06 - 12:10)
i have so many questions about the (12:09 - 12:13)
design choices made (12:10 - 12:16)
okay so ceremony is saying by nicole (12:13 - 12:18)
like you guys correct (12:16 - 12:19)
and then (12:18 - 12:21)
barbarical is what evolves into which (12:19 - 12:22)
makes sense because it's supposed to be (12:21 - 12:25)
like barbarian right (12:22 - 12:26)
barbarian (12:25 - 12:29)
barnacle acceptable (12:26 - 12:32)
barbaric barbarical bar bear uncle (12:29 - 12:34)
bi knuckle (12:32 - 12:36)

you've gone towards the global challenge (14:14 - 14:18)
here okay (14:16 - 14:20)
600 million there's a lot of pokemon i (14:18 - 14:21)
have a complaint (14:20 - 14:23)
it's just big surprise (14:21 - 14:26)
i have walked (14:23 - 14:27)
with that (14:26 - 14:28)
app open (14:27 - 14:31)
multiple kilometers and it's refusing to (14:28 - 14:33)
acknowledge that i've done the two (14:31 - 14:34)
kilometer (14:33 - 14:36)
thing on the radio oh it refuses it's (14:34 - 14:39)
not only pokemon go pikmin bloom has (14:36 - 14:41)
whatever they've made some change and (14:39 - 14:43)
it's just any of these issues it's like (14:41 - 14:46)
no and i've i have walked around i have (14:43 - 14:48)
i have power cycle your phone turn your (14:46 - 14:50)
phone off and turn back on (14:48 - 14:51)
no (14:50 - 14:53)
what you have to do is go to canada (14:51 - 14:55)
because it tracks everything here is (14:53 - 14:57)
miles and you haven't walked any (14:55 - 14:58)
kilometers because you got to go to (14:57 - 15:00)
canada where they actually use what if i (14:58 - 15:03)
wear my canadian shoes (15:00 - 15:04)
no (15:03 - 15:05)
dang (15:04 - 15:08)
i did have an issue trying to pair um a (15:05 - 15:10)
pokeball plus the irene's pokemon go she (15:08 - 15:11)
hasn't opened pokemon go in like three (15:10 - 15:14)
months and we went to play yesterday and (15:11 - 15:17)
both pokeball go pluses pokeball (15:14 - 15:20)
plus poke what the pokeball thing both (15:17 - 15:21)
paired to my phone instantly i (15:20 - 15:23)
disconnected one paired the other one (15:21 - 15:24)
disconnected that one paired the other (15:23 - 15:26)
one could go back and forth no problems (15:24 - 15:28)
with mine (15:26 - 15:31)
and then for hers it just (15:28 - 15:33)
nothing would pair neither of the (15:31 - 15:35)
pokeballs would pair and i just had to (15:33 - 15:36)
end up force quitting the app and that (15:35 - 15:38)
fixed it (15:36 - 15:39)
but i went into bluetooth i went into (15:38 - 15:42)
settings i just (15:39 - 15:42)
i would power cycle the phone though (15:43 - 15:46)
because that sounds like a communication (15:44 - 15:49)
issue between pogo and apple health (15:46 - 15:52)
none of my other apps that walk (15:49 - 15:54)
that keep track of my steps (15:52 - 15:56)
are having this issue (15:54 - 15:59)
pokemon go i realize that you are mad at (15:56 - 16:01)
me for calling you out and you've shut (15:59 - 16:04)
off certain functions to my pokemon go (16:01 - 16:07)
and i will be filing a complaint with (16:04 - 16:09)
yeah is the fpcc (16:07 - 16:11)
i know the better business bureau will (16:09 - 16:12)
do nothing (16:11 - 16:14)
now you got to complain to the apple (16:12 - 16:16)
store oh i'll complain to the other one (16:14 - 16:17)
yeah yeah make a genius bar appointment (16:16 - 16:20)
get them removed from the apples no the (16:17 - 16:23)
app store (16:20 - 16:23)
okay (16:26 - 16:29)
you really want the true (16:27 - 16:32)
this is how you do it if you really want (16:29 - 16:34)
to go you do it file your complaint (16:32 - 16:36)
saying that they're spreading (16:34 - 16:38)
misinformation about (16:36 - 16:40)
particular situations in the world right (16:38 - 16:42)
now that are sensitive (16:40 - 16:44)
and then when they come to you and say (16:42 - 16:46)
how is pokemon go doing that say oops i (16:44 - 16:48)
filed the wrong complaint but while i (16:46 - 16:50)
have your ear (16:48 - 16:53)
they're not tracking my kilometers while (16:50 - 16:56)
we're on the subject of shady practices (16:53 - 16:58)
let me tell you about the fact that they (16:56 - 16:59)
refuse (16:58 - 17:02)
to track my actual steps (16:59 - 17:04)
and i am working hard for those steps i (17:02 - 17:07)
am walking through my neighborhood where (17:04 - 17:09)
there are people who may want to talk to (17:07 - 17:11)
me (17:09 - 17:13)
that is that is a danger uh speaking of (17:11 - 17:14)
tracking (17:13 - 17:16)
uh so the global challenge bonus reward (17:14 - 17:20)
was two times the catch candy (17:16 - 17:21)
and (17:20 - 17:24)
that is going for the next week (17:21 - 17:25)
or whatever however whenever this (17:24 - 17:27)
podcast this podcast goes up on monday (17:25 - 17:28)
however many days are left i think six (17:27 - 17:30)
days left (17:28 - 17:31)
i want to talk about (17:30 - 17:35)
how i have a love-hate relationship with (17:31 - 17:37)
the leaderboard i love the leaderboard i (17:35 - 17:40)
think it does for sure encourage me to (17:37 - 17:41)
go out and catch more pokemon because i (17:40 - 17:44)
like my number being bigger than anyone (17:41 - 17:46)
else's this is also a thing that they (17:44 - 17:48)
started in pikmin (17:46 - 17:50)
right (17:48 - 17:51)
where's this leaderboard well and i'm (17:50 - 17:54)
also surprised that greg is not shocked (17:51 - 17:56)
for the same reason that i'm shocked on (17:54 - 17:57)
a leaderboard you want your number to be (17:56 - 17:59)
lower than everybody else's you want to (17:57 - 18:01)
be number one not number right (17:59 - 18:03)
you need to catch a lot of pokemon for (18:01 - 18:04)
you to be number one (18:03 - 18:07)
but the leaderboard only tracks your the (18:04 - 18:09)
lowered number is better it's not (18:07 - 18:13)
no this isn't golf (18:09 - 18:13)
but the pyramid is the leaderboard (18:14 - 18:19)
what it's under the (18:16 - 18:20)
the (18:19 - 18:21)
today view or whatever it's his first (18:20 - 18:22)
tab (18:21 - 18:23)
first app (18:22 - 18:27)
will do you like the um do you like the (18:23 - 18:29)
oh i have stuff what's this challenge if (18:27 - 18:32)
this is a question about pikmin okay (18:29 - 18:34)
two things two responses for you number (18:32 - 18:37)
one for all you so-called friends who i (18:34 - 18:39)
send postcards to every single day (18:37 - 18:41)
nobody's invited me to a walk challenge (18:39 - 18:43)
okay i don't understand how this works (18:41 - 18:44)
because i keep getting i i've had three (18:43 - 18:47)
walk challenges in a row i keep getting (18:44 - 18:50)
paired with tone tone is in our slack (18:47 - 18:53)
uh they they walk just as much as me but (18:50 - 18:55)
i have you on my friends list i have (18:53 - 18:57)
like pengu who's been on the show (18:55 - 18:59)
and i want to walk with you guys (18:57 - 19:03)
you all y'all the southern form of (18:59 - 19:04)
you and all (19:03 - 19:06)
but there's no way to invite i just go (19:04 - 19:08)
into the the walk challenge and it's (19:06 - 19:09)
like here's the five people you're stuck (19:08 - 19:11)
with this week look i like being stuck (19:09 - 19:13)
with tone i got no problem they pulled (19:11 - 19:15)
their legs uh but (19:13 - 19:17)
that was like absolutely sleeping (19:15 - 19:20)
pulling their weight pull their legs um (19:17 - 19:21)
i don't know how to be in your walking (19:20 - 19:22)
group (19:21 - 19:24)
and the number two issue with pikmin (19:22 - 19:26)
bloom is they are literally and i mean (19:24 - 19:28)
literally in the literal sense of (19:26 - 19:29)
literally (19:28 - 19:32)
one more ui glitch (19:29 - 19:36)
from me deleting that app (19:32 - 19:36)
because i have never oh yeah (19:36 - 19:43)
with so much bad ui stacked on top of (19:39 - 19:46)
each other it's like they're trying to (19:43 - 19:49)
drive me away it's not that bad no no no (19:46 - 19:51)
no don't you even not that don't you (19:49 - 19:52)
excuse bad behavior (19:51 - 19:55)
listen this is what i recommend this no (19:52 - 20:00)
no no no exactly your phone is 20 22. (19:55 - 20:01)
here's the thing and i don't even know (20:00 - 20:03)
if i can explain this properly but (20:01 - 20:04)
here's the thing (20:03 - 20:08)
if i get a postcard from you (20:04 - 20:09)
and (20:08 - 20:10)
greg (20:09 - 20:11)
even though greg never opens the app and (20:10 - 20:13)
doesn't send postcards back (20:11 - 20:16)
and i go into that field view (20:13 - 20:18)
where all my pikmin are in the field (20:16 - 20:22)
if i touch the postcards first (20:18 - 20:24)
i do not have the option to immediately (20:22 - 20:26)
send you a reply (20:24 - 20:29)
if i clear all the fruit that's been (20:26 - 20:31)
collected from expeditions and all of (20:29 - 20:33)
the rewards from doing mushroom raids (20:31 - 20:36)
and then touch you your postcards (20:33 - 20:38)
because you dudes are standing there in (20:36 - 20:39)
front of everybody throughout this (20:38 - 20:42)
entire thing so i very carefully have to (20:39 - 20:45)
avoid touching you (20:42 - 20:47)
then i can immediately send a reply (20:45 - 20:49)
postcard to your postcard (20:47 - 20:50)
this (20:49 - 20:53)
is so frustrating (20:50 - 20:53)
okay i got i got the perfect solution (20:54 - 20:58)
can i block postcards (20:57 - 21:00)
make a genius barb (20:58 - 21:01)
make a genius (21:00 - 21:03)
and then (21:01 - 21:06)
just delete the app for as much as i did (21:03 - 21:09)
you try force quitting no (21:06 - 21:11)
because (21:09 - 21:12)
your phone (21:11 - 21:14)
and i still not saying that i've walked (21:12 - 21:16)
anything so (21:14 - 21:17)
well you because you're sitting here (21:16 - 21:19)
right now (21:17 - 21:19)
it doesn't know what i'm doing that (21:20 - 21:23)
never works for me (21:22 - 21:25)
okay hold on we're getting we're getting (21:23 - 21:27)
off topic here okay so the thing i like (21:25 - 21:28)
in pikmin and the thing i like in (21:27 - 21:30)
pokemon go it's the same thing it is the (21:28 - 21:32)
leaderboard if i'm if i'm in a group of (21:30 - 21:34)
five people in pikmin (21:32 - 21:36)
i don't want to be the person that's not (21:34 - 21:39)
walking the most i don't want to be that (21:36 - 21:41)
guy i don't be the guy that's like oh (21:39 - 21:45)
there's a a 100 000 step challenge (21:41 - 21:47)
steve's only walked a thousand tone over (21:45 - 21:50)
here is walked thirty thousand and then (21:47 - 21:52)
because it shows like the bars they fill (21:50 - 21:54)
up and then it's like oh my bar is like (21:52 - 21:57)
really small so because of that (21:54 - 21:58)

do not stop them and say hey be careful (26:44 - 26:50)
you might run over a fish (26:48 - 26:54)
because guess what fish can tell when a (26:50 - 26:57)
bike is heading down the trail at them (26:54 - 27:00)
and they will swim out of the way okay (26:57 - 27:01)
they were just being friendly there i (27:00 - 27:04)
don't need that kind of friendliness you (27:01 - 27:07)
interrupted by flow you don't have flow (27:04 - 27:09)
and how stupid do you think fish are (27:07 - 27:10)
that they're just going to sit there (27:09 - 27:13)
while a 230 pound man on a 40 pound (27:10 - 27:15)
steel bike is bearing down on them (27:13 - 27:18)
they're pretty done (27:15 - 27:18)
i just had two peakmen put on stickers (27:18 - 27:23)
and this app is garbage (27:20 - 27:25)
you got that right (27:23 - 27:28)
pikmin is a very good game (27:25 - 27:30)
you know what the ultimate life's (27:28 - 27:31)
disappointment is and i can tell you (27:30 - 27:32)
there's a lot of things that will (27:31 - 27:34)
disappoint your life but the the biggest (27:32 - 27:37)
one is you send a pikmin out (27:34 - 27:41)
to st louis missouri to pick up (27:37 - 27:45)
a large white planter pot (27:41 - 27:47)
it takes you know eight days to get (27:45 - 27:49)
there eight days to come back and you (27:47 - 27:52)
you you incubate that planter plot and (27:49 - 27:54)
it's finally time for that pikmin to (27:52 - 27:56)
hatch and it pops out and it's like i'm (27:54 - 27:57)
gonna put on something special that came (27:56 - 28:00)
with my pot and guess what it's an s (27:57 - 28:03)
sticker yeah yep (28:00 - 28:06)
you can have it okay so no no no no no (28:03 - 28:09)
no no no don't don't do your tail you (28:06 - 28:11)
can tell what it is nobody's got time (28:09 - 28:13)
for that garbage (28:11 - 28:15)
i know it has time to send the postcards (28:13 - 28:16)
that's why i don't do it (28:15 - 28:18)

and all three characters have the same (32:59 - 33:03)
thing in common (33:01 - 33:06)
no one cares about it (33:03 - 33:06)
i mean as far as they're okay masters (33:07 - 33:13)
goes (33:12 - 33:15)
um (33:13 - 33:15)
they're decent like (33:15 - 33:20)
aaron investor queen is actually pretty (33:17 - 33:23)
good because it's bulky (33:20 - 33:26)
um so i think of (33:23 - 33:29)
of the three it's probably (33:26 - 33:30)
i mean (33:29 - 33:31)
it's probably (33:30 - 33:33)
the best of them as aaron and vespa (33:31 - 33:34)
quinn (33:33 - 33:36)
um (33:34 - 33:39)
but like i don't feel like they cover (33:36 - 33:40)
they really (33:39 - 33:43)
fill spots that aren't covered by other (33:40 - 33:45)
people but (33:43 - 33:47)
uh it is good to have (33:45 - 33:49)
uh for certain events (33:47 - 33:52)
bulkier bug types (33:49 - 33:54)
i have yet to pull (33:52 - 33:56)
successfully any of them (33:54 - 33:58)
i am holding on to as many gems they (33:56 - 34:01)
have because the two year anniversary or (33:58 - 34:03)
the three three coming up (34:01 - 34:05)

full disclosure (34:10 - 34:14)
m partnered with dna they do send me (34:12 - 34:16)
gems every month um (34:14 - 34:19)
when i say that no one likes these pairs (34:16 - 34:21)
i mean like (34:19 - 34:23)
outside of masters like these are not (34:21 - 34:24)
very (34:23 - 34:26)
high profile memorable characters now i (34:24 - 34:28)
know there's somebody listening being (34:26 - 34:30)
like oh i love eric i'm sure you exist (34:28 - 34:32)
i'm sure the aaron person exists (34:30 - 34:35)
um the aaron person (34:32 - 34:37)
but like (34:35 - 34:39)
like they are not nearly the same level (34:37 - 34:43)
of like a cynthia or a leon or um (34:39 - 34:45)
even karen i feel like people gravitate (34:43 - 34:47)
towards because (34:45 - 34:49)
she was that dark (34:47 - 34:51)
elite four member you know now she weak (34:49 - 34:53)
pokemon strong pokemon you should use (34:51 - 34:56)
your favorite pokemon (34:53 - 34:56)
uh (34:58 - 35:01)
yeah i mean they're very they're very (34:59 - 35:04)
cool uh it's it's really great that you (35:01 - 35:08)
know over the years that we've watched (35:04 - 35:12)
wheels grow up to actually be lucian (35:08 - 35:14)
it's it's you know the hair is a little (35:12 - 35:16)
pink (35:14 - 35:17)
they should have maybe made it a little (35:16 - 35:21)
bit more purple but they're almost there (35:17 - 35:22)
look (35:21 - 35:25)
i can't i can't see lucian with lucian (35:22 - 35:28)
without thinking of wheels (35:25 - 35:30)
that is so weird that you would bring (35:28 - 35:32)
that up because i was in a game stop (35:30 - 35:34)
yesterday and the person working at the (35:32 - 35:35)
gamestop i was like (35:34 - 35:38)
that looks just like wheels if they were (35:35 - 35:39)
two feet taller (35:38 - 35:42)
i was like this is so weird (35:39 - 35:43)
i (35:42 - 35:44)
guess (35:43 - 35:46)
i i will say the hairstyle is very (35:44 - 35:48)
similar yeah the hairstyle on the glass (35:46 - 35:50)
wheel's hair right now is (35:48 - 35:53)
outstanding so (35:50 - 35:53)
i yeah and now that you see i can i can (35:54 - 36:00)
at least see where you're coming from (35:56 - 36:01)
hey i bet they would look good in a red (36:00 - 36:03)
suit (36:01 - 36:04)
oh probably (36:03 - 36:06)
i'm sure they would i feel like most (36:04 - 36:09)
people look good in a red suit (36:06 - 36:09)
i'm gonna say no (36:10 - 36:16)
to that well okay it depends (36:12 - 36:18)
if it's some people look good in the (36:16 - 36:20)
blue or reds and some people look good (36:18 - 36:22)
in the (36:20 - 36:24)
more orangey yellowy reds (36:22 - 36:25)
but like (36:24 - 36:27)
a lot of people don't know which one (36:25 - 36:29)
they should be wearing and that i would (36:27 - 36:31)
definitely need like a darker (36:29 - 36:33)
maroon-ish (36:31 - 36:35)
we need more of the blue tinting yeah (36:33 - 36:39)
yeah yeah yeah i promise when i wear red (36:35 - 36:42)
my wonderful face also turns red (36:39 - 36:45)

uh (40:43 - 40:46)
they're also said in the tagline the (40:45 - 40:49)
psychic type evolution of evie will be (40:46 - 40:52)
the 35th champion in this moba there are (40:49 - 40:54)
35 characters and unite at this point (40:52 - 40:57)
holy yeah that seems right (40:54 - 40:58)
espiona is a psychic type pokemon from (40:57 - 41:01)
gen 2 will arrive on pokemon unites eos (40:58 - 41:05)
island on may 16th as a ranged (41:01 - 41:09)
attacker yes uh (41:05 - 41:09)
man 35 characters and pokemon unite and (41:10 - 41:14)
none of them can go to dreadnaught (41:12 - 41:16)
no (41:14 - 41:16)
how much the game will charge for uh (41:17 - 41:22)
espeon's unite license champions are (41:20 - 41:24)
usually ten thousand coins it's going to (41:22 - 41:26)
be 10th like (41:24 - 41:29)
get with it dot esports there's no way (41:26 - 41:34)
espn is not 10 000 coins (41:29 - 41:34)
uh i'm actually surprised they they're (41:35 - 41:39)
doing another eevee (41:37 - 41:40)
because (41:39 - 41:42)
are we gonna get to the point where some (41:40 - 41:44)
team is just gonna be like all evs and (41:42 - 41:46)
that possibly the thing is is they're (41:44 - 41:47)
both (41:46 - 41:49)
ranged attackers (41:47 - 41:51)
so the question is (41:49 - 41:53)
i'm still like what is espion going to (41:51 - 41:54)
bring (41:53 - 41:56)
that you would pick espeon over sylveon (41:54 - 41:58)
because they're both (41:56 - 42:01)
ranged (41:58 - 42:01)
attackers right so i i'm very curious (42:01 - 42:06)
what espn is like (42:04 - 42:07)
what the extras of the moves are going (42:06 - 42:09)
to be like what the moves actually will (42:07 - 42:10)
be (42:09 - 42:12)
this is the 11th attacker so your (42:10 - 42:14)
attackers so far are cinderace cramerant (42:12 - 42:17)
decidueye deraladon gardavor greninja (42:14 - 42:19)
alolan ninetails (42:17 - 42:21)
which i don't i feel like nineteen's (42:19 - 42:24)
more of a defender pikachu and sylvia (42:21 - 42:26)
uh not after the last patch they did a (42:24 - 42:29)
lot to change (42:26 - 42:29)
how nine tails works (42:29 - 42:33)
i remember very early games of nine (42:32 - 42:36)
tails it was just like it didn't really (42:33 - 42:37)
attack it just kind of defended because (42:36 - 42:39)
it just froze you and pushed you away (42:37 - 42:40)
instead of some freezing but they (42:39 - 42:42)
changed like how aurora they changed a (42:40 - 42:44)
bunch of things so that it is a much (42:42 - 42:48)
more viable attacker now (42:44 - 42:48)
i am still (42:51 - 42:55)
interested on the rumored next one (42:52 - 42:56)
because that's what i want to spend my (42:55 - 42:58)
question well i remember reading it was (42:56 - 43:01)
a psychic pokemon right yep (42:58 - 43:01)
what was it i don't remember (43:02 - 43:06)
dale fox oh yeah yeah (43:03 - 43:08)
rumored to be next and i am definitely (43:06 - 43:10)
buying that one (43:08 - 43:11)
i don't know if i'm gonna get espion i (43:10 - 43:13)
need to see i need to see (43:11 - 43:15)
how do you not just have a million coins (43:13 - 43:17)
just to buy stuff i mean i have to i'm (43:15 - 43:21)
sitting on 25 000 right now (43:17 - 43:21)

action uh it will premiere later on (44:35 - 44:40)
netflix it will premiere on netflix (44:38 - 44:42)
later this year's fan can stay tuned for (44:40 - 44:44)
netflix to get more information did i (44:42 - 44:47)
tell you guys about the guy in the card (44:44 - 44:49)
shop on tuesday night who was arguing (44:47 - 44:51)
that he wasn't going to spend any money (44:49 - 44:53)
on the pokemon tcg because their uh the (44:51 - 44:55)
world coronation series proves that (44:53 - 44:57)
pokemon is coming to an end uh yeah you (44:55 - 44:59)
told me about that that's very funny (44:57 - 45:00)
excuse me (44:59 - 45:01)
uh (45:00 - 45:03)
dude was arguing about (45:01 - 45:06)
it on the website on pokemon.com it says (45:03 - 45:09)
may 28th (45:06 - 45:11)
2012 i think may 28th is the last part (45:09 - 45:14)
of pokemon (45:11 - 45:16)
master journeys (45:14 - 45:18)
season 25 of the anime series is set to (45:16 - 45:20)
premiere later this year on netflix and (45:18 - 45:25)
on may 28 2022 in canada (45:20 - 45:27)
so it can't be that much later (45:25 - 45:29)
right yeah i just don't think master (45:27 - 45:31)
journeys is done i think there's 12 more (45:29 - 45:34)
episodes because doesn't master journeys (45:31 - 45:35)
ends with the darkrai cresselia (45:34 - 45:38)
storyline (45:35 - 45:38)
i think so (45:42 - 45:44)
that was like a two-parter episode (45:44 - 45:48)
it's every three months though so if if (45:49 - 45:52)
we're getting the next 12 episodes on (45:50 - 45:54)
may 28th may (45:52 - 45:56)
june july that means we should be (45:54 - 45:58)
getting the next 12 in august (45:56 - 46:00)
and then september october and then in (45:58 - 46:02)
november so that would make sense (46:00 - 46:02)
because there would probably be a new (46:02 - 46:04)
game in november (46:02 - 46:05)
so yeah that that should all make sense (46:04 - 46:09)
august may august november (46:05 - 46:09)

everything an arceus except for one (51:07 - 51:13)
because i i don't i don't (51:10 - 51:14)

main series games on the nintendo switch (52:05 - 52:09)
let's go pikachu let's go eevee (52:07 - 52:11)
brilliant diamond shining pearl sword (52:09 - 52:12)
and shield (52:11 - 52:15)
uh legends arceus (52:12 - 52:19)
none of them have complete pokedexes (52:15 - 52:20)
they said (52:19 - 52:22)
they put their stake in the ground they (52:20 - 52:25)
drew their line they said no pokemon (52:22 - 52:28)
game will have a complete pokedex (52:25 - 52:30)
and they've proven it over four (52:28 - 52:33)

pokemon what happens when we get to 1500 (52:41 - 52:47)
pokemon then like just add them argument (52:43 - 52:48)
doesn't work (52:47 - 52:50)
it's just like having the jimmy john's (52:48 - 52:52)
driver in your neighborhood and you're (52:50 - 52:55)
two streets over and you're like hey can (52:52 - 52:57)

this person they're not gonna add the (53:08 - 53:11)
rest of the pokemon (53:10 - 53:14)
we're six months away from a brand new (53:11 - 53:17)
generation we are moving from gen8 to (53:14 - 53:19)
gen 9. why would they spend any (53:17 - 53:21)
resources any time updating a (53:19 - 53:23)
three-year-old game that has sold 25 (53:21 - 53:26)
million copies they are probably all (53:23 - 53:28)
hands on deck to make sure that scarlett (53:26 - 53:31)
and violet get out properly this year (53:28 - 53:33)
the fact that we (53:31 - 53:36)
got arceus and two dlc's in between i'm (53:33 - 53:36)
not (53:36 - 53:38)
it's a bear it's a shame we got (53:36 - 53:40)
brilliant type of shiny part but the (53:38 - 53:42)
fact that we got arceus a very great (53:40 - 53:46)
game and two dlcs in between all of this (53:42 - 53:46)
they're they're probably stretched very (53:46 - 53:50)
thin i would assume that's a lot of game (53:48 - 53:51)
they they're they're pumping them out (53:50 - 53:53)
over there at game freak (53:51 - 53:55)
but (53:53 - 53:57)
anyways okay now that that's out of the (53:55 - 54:00)
way my problem my not my problem my my (53:57 - 54:03)
my my concern not really a concern it's (54:00 - 54:05)
not that big of a deal but (54:03 - 54:07)
if i caught (54:05 - 54:08)
a (54:07 - 54:10)
feather ball shellos (54:08 - 54:12)
in legends (54:10 - 54:15)
i could then move it into brilliant (54:12 - 54:17)
diamond shining pearl and it would have (54:15 - 54:19)
the strange ball (54:17 - 54:21)
very cool strange ball great not a (54:19 - 54:22)
feather ball but at least it's not a (54:21 - 54:24)
pokeball it's something to signify that (54:22 - 54:26)
you know it was caught in an ancient (54:24 - 54:28)
game or like a in the past or whatever (54:26 - 54:30)
and then i could i could i could walk (54:28 - 54:32)
that shellos all around (54:30 - 54:34)
the cinahl region and i could get the (54:32 - 54:36)
ribbons on it i could go (54:34 - 54:38)
beat the elite four with it (54:36 - 54:40)
i could go put in the daycare breed (54:38 - 54:41)
little (54:40 - 54:44)
ancient babies from the shellos (54:41 - 54:46)
but then if i move the shellos into (54:44 - 54:48)
sword and shield (54:46 - 54:50)
i now go from that cool unique strange (54:48 - 54:53)
ball to a regular pokeball and now all (54:50 - 54:55)
of a sudden the shellos is like (54:53 - 54:58)
oh it's just in a pokeball now (54:55 - 55:00)
and that that to me is the bummer (54:58 - 55:02)
because like if when i do if i do move (55:00 - 55:04)
it to the (55:02 - 55:07)
diamond and pearl i can get a bunch of (55:04 - 55:10)
ribbons on it it's in a cool ball it has (55:07 - 55:12)
the cool ball animation throw when i (55:10 - 55:14)
throw it out in battle and then that (55:12 - 55:16)
kind of all that like specialness kind (55:14 - 55:18)
of disappears into sword and shield (55:16 - 55:20)
and i would (55:18 - 55:21)
want to send it like i guess i would (55:20 - 55:23)
want to send it to sword and shield to (55:21 - 55:24)
get the ribbons or to use it (55:23 - 55:27)
competitively or to like you know like (55:24 - 55:30)
wait until violet and scarlet yeah i (55:27 - 55:32)
guess that's a new ball (55:30 - 55:34)
yeah just have patience (55:32 - 55:36)
yeah that's like but then it's like i'm (55:34 - 55:37)
skipping (55:36 - 55:38)
sword and shield and i'm not getting (55:37 - 55:40)
those ribbons so my the question i guess (55:38 - 55:43)
i have is if home is smart enough to (55:40 - 55:44)
remember (55:43 - 55:46)
which ball you catch it into because (55:44 - 55:49)
that's what it says in the press release (55:46 - 55:50)
so if i if i catch the shell loss and (55:49 - 55:53)
the feather ball i move it to (55:50 - 55:55)
diamond and pearl it's in the strange (55:53 - 55:57)
ball i move it back (55:55 - 55:58)
to (55:57 - 56:00)
legends it should be back in the feather (55:58 - 56:01)
ball (56:00 - 56:02)
right i think that's what they're saying (56:01 - 56:05)
if i move it to sword and shield it will (56:02 - 56:07)
be in the pokeball if it touches sword (56:05 - 56:10)
and shield and i move it back to legends (56:07 - 56:12)
is it in a pokeball i don't know and i (56:10 - 56:15)
don't wanna i i'm gonna i wanna test it (56:12 - 56:17)
with something i don't care about (56:15 - 56:19)
something you don't care about please (56:17 - 56:21)
yes and if i don't move it to sword and (56:19 - 56:23)
shield and i wait to scarlet and violet (56:21 - 56:25)
and then when scarlet comes out we gotta (56:23 - 56:27)
wait like 18 months for them to update (56:25 - 56:28)
home again because apparently this is a (56:27 - 56:31)
disaster (56:28 - 56:33)
if the scarlet and violet remember it (56:31 - 56:35)
and if it touches sword and shield then (56:33 - 56:36)
it permanently changes into pokeball and (56:35 - 56:38)
then i move it to scarlet violet as (56:36 - 56:40)
always like does touching sword and (56:38 - 56:41)
shield at this point permanently just (56:40 - 56:43)
turn everything into a pokemon is it (56:41 - 56:45)
toxic (56:43 - 56:45)
something touches it its ability also (56:47 - 56:52)
turns mommy i mean the thing is (56:49 - 56:54)
i have a strong feeling that if it (56:52 - 56:55)
touches sword and shield it ruins (56:54 - 56:56)
everything because they're not gonna (56:55 - 56:59)
update sword and shield (56:56 - 57:00)
right well sword and shield will (56:59 - 57:03)
probably get an at least an update to (57:00 - 57:06)
signa 5 mark but that mark that mark (57:03 - 57:08)
stuff in sword and shield the origin (57:06 - 57:10)
mark sorry the origin mark and sword and (57:08 - 57:13)
shield has always been there (57:10 - 57:16)
um they just have to push like a point (57:13 - 57:18)
zero zero one update to then just (57:16 - 57:20)
signify the little like sim it's like (57:18 - 57:23)
literally a a one kilobyte png they (57:20 - 57:27)
gotta toggle on (57:23 - 57:27)
um so that that will probably that that (57:28 - 57:31)
will probably be the like the only (57:30 - 57:34)
update sword and shield gets is just to (57:31 - 57:36)
clarify the origin mark (57:34 - 57:38)
um which i'm sure again you're gonna see (57:36 - 57:39)
twitter and reddit freak out that like (57:38 - 57:41)
sword and chill is updating and we're (57:39 - 57:42)
gonna be able to move our best (57:41 - 57:44)
collegiate no you're not gonna be able (57:42 - 57:46)
to move your basket legion in i mean i (57:44 - 57:50)
just don't i do think that (57:46 - 57:50)
they're not gonna do a massive update to (57:50 - 57:54)
sword and shield (57:52 - 57:56)
and if you touch sword and shield it's (57:54 - 57:59)
spoiled forever (57:56 - 57:59)
so don't move anything in disorder just (58:00 - 58:04)
be very wary until you know for sure (58:02 - 58:05)
yeah (58:04 - 58:06)
and i (58:05 - 58:08)
the strange ball is bad just give me my (58:06 - 58:10)
gigaton ball (58:08 - 58:12)
ball i think it's cool just wait the six (58:10 - 58:14)
months for scarlett violet to come out (58:12 - 58:17)
and find out the 15 months for home to (58:14 - 58:19)
come up yeah be patient (58:17 - 58:21)
what's the rush to move (58:19 - 58:23)
yeah they've already been collected in (58:21 - 58:24)
dust (58:23 - 58:26)
this is but this this is what will (58:24 - 58:29)
anderson wants to see because i'm evil (58:26 - 58:30)
of the three of us i'm the most evil (58:29 - 58:33)
let's put it that way yes (58:30 - 58:34)
once (58:33 - 58:36)
competitive shifts (58:34 - 58:39)
to scarlet and violet (58:36 - 58:42)
i want them to push out one last update (58:39 - 58:43)
to sword and shield that says now all (58:42 - 58:44)
pokemon are available in sword and (58:43 - 58:47)
shield (58:44 - 58:47)
i'm gonna do that i'm here for it (58:48 - 58:55)
the other thing is like alpha pokemon (58:51 - 58:58)
if i if i take an alpha b barrel (58:55 - 59:00)
from legends (58:58 - 59:02)
and i move it into sword and shield (59:00 - 59:05)
it will obviously be a regular b barrel (59:02 - 59:08)
right there's no way it will be alpha (59:05 - 59:10)
it will have the little it will be in a (59:08 - 59:12)
pokeball because that's what they said (59:10 - 59:14)
and so if i move this alpha b barrel (59:12 - 59:17)
back into legends (59:14 - 59:18)
is it still going to be alpha (59:17 - 59:20)
is (59:18 - 59:21)
like (59:20 - 59:24)
trust nothing no i know assume the word (59:21 - 59:25)
test didn't find out (59:24 - 59:27)
i i'm going to wait for you to test it (59:25 - 59:29)
on stream and then (59:27 - 59:30)
well (59:29 - 59:32)
pokemon are very easy to come by so (59:30 - 59:34)
you're gonna trust him to test something (59:32 - 59:36)
after his lies about pushings and (59:34 - 59:38)
outbreaks (59:36 - 59:40)
well i mean i hadn't tried to be there (59:38 - 59:42)
to watch it and that's my fault that (59:40 - 59:45)
they updated the (59:42 - 59:48)
i (59:45 - 59:48)
heavy ball does exist (59:52 - 59:57)
in legends (59:54 - 59:59)
and for whatever reason (59:57 - 60:01)
this bothers me so much it bothers me so (59:59 - 60:05)
much that they were like heavy ball (60:01 - 60:07)
but it doesn't do what the heavy ball (60:05 - 60:09)
does (60:07 - 60:11)
yeah and then they were like gigaton (60:09 - 60:14)
ball and what was the other one (60:11 - 60:16)
lady lead ball or whatever (60:14 - 60:18)
there was three of them (60:16 - 60:20)
isn't it (60:18 - 60:20)
like you you you came up with two brand (60:21 - 60:26)
new names why did you decide to use the (60:23 - 60:28)
word heavy but have you investigated (60:26 - 60:30)
whether whether that's a translation (60:28 - 60:32)
issue like is it two different words in (60:30 - 60:36)
japanese and the english we are in 2022 (60:32 - 60:37)
how are we getting translation issues at (60:36 - 60:38)
this point (60:37 - 60:41)
uh because we live in this world right (60:38 - 60:44)
like are you kidding (60:41 - 60:46)
what other word does english have for (60:44 - 60:48)
heavy (60:46 - 60:49)
gigaton (60:48 - 60:52)
no but they use that they use it later (60:49 - 60:57)
are they going to say weighty ball sure (60:52 - 60:57)
you're shaming me (60:59 - 61:02)
look if the if there was somebody (61:04 - 61:08)
listening hold on hold on (61:05 - 61:08)
you do the research if somebody was (61:09 - 61:14)
not reading these giant press releases (61:12 - 61:17)
of how pokemon home works (61:14 - 61:19)
and (61:17 - 61:21)
actually let's back up beep beep beep (61:19 - 61:23)
beep (61:21 - 61:26)
do you know how many people (61:23 - 61:28)
through and it's not a lot of people (61:26 - 61:30)
maybe like 200 some people come through (61:28 - 61:32)
my twitch streams (61:30 - 61:34)
and are like oh (61:32 - 61:36)
the heavy ball does this like they (61:34 - 61:37)
thought (61:36 - 61:40)
yeah it was supposed to be for heavy (61:37 - 61:43)
pokemon and so they wouldn't use it on (61:40 - 61:46)
like a starly or a b doof or a (61:43 - 61:48)
ponyta because those are not heavy (61:46 - 61:49)
pokemon because no matter how many times (61:48 - 61:52)
will says read the instruction text when (61:49 - 61:53)
they give it to you you skipped right (61:52 - 61:56)
through it correct (61:53 - 61:58)
but the whole line the heavy ball (61:56 - 62:01)
gigaton lydian ball (61:58 - 62:03)
just doubles the catch rate if you hit (62:01 - 62:05)
them in the back of the head with it (62:03 - 62:07)
that's all it does they should sneak up (62:05 - 62:10)
on them yeah the bonk ball (62:07 - 62:11)
that would have been a great name i love (62:10 - 62:12)
the ball (62:11 - 62:15)
here we go i'm going to read you (62:12 - 62:17)
the list of synonyms for heavy (62:15 - 62:20)
and you tell me which one you like no (62:17 - 62:22)
that's not look up to see whether it's (62:20 - 62:24)
japanese whether it has two different (62:22 - 62:26)
names in japanese (62:24 - 62:28)
shush (62:26 - 62:28)
here here's the list it won't take long (62:29 - 62:33)
and you can pick your favorite (62:31 - 62:34)
synonyms for heavy (62:33 - 62:36)
awkward big (62:34 - 62:37)
bulky (62:36 - 62:39)
burdensome (62:37 - 62:40)
considerable (62:39 - 62:42)
cumbersome (62:40 - 62:43)
excessive (62:42 - 62:44)
fat (62:43 - 62:46)
hefty (62:44 - 62:47)
huge (62:46 - 62:49)
large (62:47 - 62:50)
massive (62:49 - 62:52)
substantial (62:50 - 62:53)
unwieldy (62:52 - 62:55)
and weighty (62:53 - 62:57)
i like weighty (62:55 - 62:58)
i like (62:57 - 63:02)
substantial ball personally (62:58 - 63:02)
it's it was the same it's the same (63:02 - 63:06)
problem with the the feather ball jet (63:04 - 63:07)
ball and (63:06 - 63:10)
wing ball wing ball (63:07 - 63:12)
great names (63:10 - 63:14)
but the amount of (63:12 - 63:16)
trainers that came through my twitch (63:14 - 63:18)
streams and were like oh i thought you (63:16 - 63:19)
were only supposed to use these on (63:18 - 63:21)
flying pokemon (63:19 - 63:26)
no they're just pokeballs they just fly (63:21 - 63:29)
farther they're not they don't increase (63:26 - 63:31)
the catch rate (63:29 - 63:32)
of (63:31 - 63:35)
flying pokemon (63:32 - 63:38)
so so for a game that was (63:35 - 63:40)
actually relatively simple at its core (63:38 - 63:43)
of like catch 240 some pokemon (63:40 - 63:45)
there's like six trainer battles in this (63:43 - 63:47)
entire game (63:45 - 63:50)
um there's five areas there's five (63:47 - 63:54)
trials or whatever elder battles (63:50 - 63:55)
for (63:54 - 63:57)
for whatever a relatively small pokemon (63:55 - 64:00)
game the two new mechanics are (63:57 - 64:02)
are one poorly named (64:00 - 64:04)
one of them is at least the heavy ball (64:02 - 64:05)
should have been named something (64:04 - 64:06)
different (64:05 - 64:08)
and the two new pokeballs no one really (64:06 - 64:10)
understood what they did because they (64:08 - 64:13)
didn't they didn't really say no one (64:10 - 64:18)
some people some people somebody um (64:13 - 64:20)
anyways (64:18 - 64:23)
it it it doesn't really bother me that (64:20 - 64:25)
the heavy ball or the wing ball or the (64:23 - 64:27)
gigaton like it doesn't really bother me (64:25 - 64:29)
that those pokeballs can't get moved (64:27 - 64:30)
forward because of like the wood and the (64:29 - 64:32)
ancient and all that kind of stuff yeah (64:30 - 64:34)
they don't have it in modern times (64:32 - 64:37)
yeah the we ran out of wood (64:34 - 64:39)
uh i the the tree texture and sword and (64:37 - 64:42)
shield just does not make a good wooden (64:39 - 64:44)
pokeball unfortunately just can't wrap (64:42 - 64:46)
their head around it i think the strange (64:44 - 64:48)
ball is great i think it's cool that if (64:46 - 64:49)
you do catch a (64:48 - 64:51)
gastrodon in legends and you move it (64:49 - 64:52)
over to the brilliant diamond shiny (64:51 - 64:54)
pearl it's in a strange ball i think (64:52 - 64:57)
that's cool i the the (64:54 - 65:00)
i would maybe assume most people (64:57 - 65:02)
listening to a pokemon podcast are (65:00 - 65:04)
hardcore enough where they might care (65:02 - 65:07)
about ball choice or they might (65:04 - 65:10)
at least like well i have a pikachu in a (65:07 - 65:12)
pokeball and i have a pikachu in a (65:10 - 65:13)
luxury ball and i have a pikachu and a (65:12 - 65:15)
love ball i would like a pikachu in a (65:13 - 65:16)
strange ball (65:15 - 65:18)
like i would i would assume those people (65:16 - 65:19)
are out there and i would assume those (65:18 - 65:21)
people are probably listening to this (65:19 - 65:24)
program according to (65:21 - 65:27)
bubble pedia (65:24 - 65:30)
the japanese is heavy ball (65:27 - 65:32)
we will need somebody from japan to (65:30 - 65:33)
actually confirm that (65:32 - 65:35)
that (65:33 - 65:38)
bubble pd is correct (65:35 - 65:38)
i i am (65:41 - 65:46)
they said the coming weeks there is no (65:44 - 65:47)
date (65:46 - 65:49)
um they also said pokemon home 2.0 i (65:47 - 65:51)
don't know if there's something more (65:49 - 65:53)
here if this is just what they're giving (65:51 - 65:56)
us well they have to update it for (65:53 - 65:59)
scarlet violet (65:56 - 66:00)
yeah (65:59 - 66:03)
so there's going to be a 2.1 (66:00 - 66:05)
and then when you go find like one point (66:03 - 66:09)
when you go from like 1.1 to 1.2 to 1.5 (66:05 - 66:12)
like 2.0 should be like a big update (66:09 - 66:14)
hey it's adding two games that's a big (66:12 - 66:16)
update (66:14 - 66:18)
yeah here's the thing what needs to (66:16 - 66:20)
happen (66:18 - 66:22)
is (66:20 - 66:24)
updating so you can transfer your (66:22 - 66:26)
licenses from unite (66:24 - 66:27)
into home (66:26 - 66:30)
what (66:27 - 66:30)
i want to be able to take (66:31 - 66:35)
my (66:34 - 66:38)
deciduous and acute star cloak (66:35 - 66:40)
into sword and shield (66:38 - 66:42)
i see i see i see (66:40 - 66:44)
if i pay 40 (66:42 - 66:45)
for a dress (66:44 - 66:49)
let me take it into other games (66:45 - 66:49)
i want to use this moment to say that (66:50 - 66:55)
unless you're a hardcore fan i still (66:53 - 66:58)
don't think home is worth 16 a year (66:55 - 67:01)
but like once you purchase it you can't (66:58 - 67:03)
back out (67:01 - 67:04)
once you made the commitment you're in (67:03 - 67:06)
it forever (67:04 - 67:08)
i also think the the storage limit is (67:06 - 67:10)
bad (67:08 - 67:13)
it's it's like 6 000 pokemon or whatever (67:10 - 67:15)
and i think joe saraby his name is joe (67:13 - 67:16)
merrick uh (67:15 - 67:18)
joe sarabee jer (67:16 - 67:21)
uh joe serrabee said that if you had (67:18 - 67:23)
if you wanted a complete national dex (67:21 - 67:26)
from every pokemon game that exists so (67:23 - 67:28)
sword and shield was that 600 poke or (67:26 - 67:29)

crypto bro you can completely run the (68:26 - 68:32)
blockchain on renewable energy sources (68:29 - 68:34)
you can't run physical banks on (68:32 - 68:36)
completely unrenewable energy sources (68:34 - 68:39)
yet not with that attitude (68:36 - 68:41)
not with that dude uh question of the (68:39 - 68:43)
week (68:41 - 68:46)
it's another question of the week (68:43 - 68:48)
no i don't i like i i want a different (68:46 - 68:52)
song nope (68:48 - 68:52)
all right we got uh (68:54 - 68:57)
what (69:01 - 69:03)
chris says who is winning charizard or (69:04 - 69:09)
blue eyes white dragon (69:06 - 69:12)
winning between the two of them (69:09 - 69:13)
yeah (69:12 - 69:15)
well charizard's real and blue eyes (69:13 - 69:18)
white dragon isn't so obviously blue (69:15 - 69:20)
eyes blue white dragon is clearly made (69:18 - 69:23)
out of metal steel is weak to fire done (69:20 - 69:26)
but dragon resists fire no (69:23 - 69:27)
no (69:26 - 69:29)
there is no place in the world that you (69:27 - 69:32)
can go and say hey there's a blue eyes (69:29 - 69:34)
white dragon flying around (69:32 - 69:37)
but you could go to kanto (69:34 - 69:40)
and there'll be a charizard somewhere (69:37 - 69:41)
flying around (69:40 - 69:43)
also (69:41 - 69:46)
sato kaiba loses every battle (69:43 - 69:49)
so there's no way (69:46 - 69:51)
blue eyes white right yukio didn't have (69:49 - 69:53)
a blue eyes white dragon right (69:51 - 69:56)
no you never he dark magician boy he had (69:53 - 69:58)
dark magician right yes (69:56 - 69:59)
his (69:58 - 70:01)
father had the blue eyes white dragon (69:59 - 70:04)
and then kaiba ripped it up (70:01 - 70:07)
are we watching yuyo yet no no we don't (70:04 - 70:12)
have 50 000 subs yet (70:07 - 70:12)
we stated the requirement but (70:12 - 70:15)
fundamentally the answer to this (70:14 - 70:17)
question is like (70:15 - 70:20)
none of the creatures none of the (70:17 - 70:22)
monsters from yugioh (70:20 - 70:24)
were representations of things in the (70:22 - 70:25)
real world (70:24 - 70:27)
they were always (70:25 - 70:30)
cards from the shadow realm they exist (70:27 - 70:31)
in the shadow realm i'm pretty sure (70:30 - 70:33)
everybody is going on vacation in the (70:31 - 70:37)
shadow realm pokemon are real (70:33 - 70:39)
did you mine are not real either digimon (70:37 - 70:43)
are data monsters digital monsters (70:39 - 70:44)
when the digital world and the real (70:43 - 70:48)
world collide go to the digiverse right (70:44 - 70:49)
that's true nobody is going to the (70:48 - 70:51)
shadow realm hanging out with a blue (70:49 - 70:53)
eyes white dragon and then coming back (70:51 - 70:55)
and saying oh that was cool you're (70:53 - 70:57)
banished to the shadow room if you don't (70:55 - 70:58)
understand what that means look up the (70:57 - 71:00)
definition of the term banished because (70:58 - 71:02)
you don't come back i mean (71:00 - 71:04)
we don't know what is happening in the (71:02 - 71:05)
shadow they could be hanging out and (71:04 - 71:07)
having a grand total oh no you read the (71:05 - 71:09)
manga you'll see awesome that nobody (71:07 - 71:11)
wants to come back from the show look at (71:09 - 71:12)
the manga you'll you'll find it there's (71:11 - 71:15)
no pokeypelago for (71:12 - 71:16)
the shadow realm that we know of but if (71:15 - 71:18)
there was you could you could plant (71:16 - 71:20)
berries and put blue eyes white dragon (71:18 - 71:23)
in a spa hmm (71:20 - 71:23)
ah this question is (71:24 - 71:27)
sorry (71:26 - 71:29)
uh this is off youtube if if you're (71:27 - 71:31)
watching on youtube feel free to like (71:29 - 71:33)
comment all that stuff uh it's from (71:31 - 71:35)
croft my question is if you had to be a (71:33 - 71:37)
mono type trainer what type would you (71:35 - 71:40)
pick and who would be your ace greg (71:37 - 71:42)
you're not allowed to use rose rose (71:40 - 71:43)
right (71:42 - 71:45)
so i saw this question and i was (71:43 - 71:48)
confused because if i'm a monotype (71:45 - 71:51)
trainer does that mean see like (71:48 - 71:53)
you use too many words does that mean (71:51 - 71:55)
that all of my pokemon can only be mono (71:53 - 71:58)
type pokemon of one type (71:55 - 72:00)
no (71:58 - 72:00)
rules m-i-a i would say standards (72:01 - 72:06)
okay so a single type (72:04 - 72:08)
or something yeah (72:06 - 72:10)
i mean we could well okay let's let's (72:08 - 72:12)
take attention to my tick tock you (72:10 - 72:14)
already know the answer to this okay (72:12 - 72:16)
well let's let's ignore the gym leader (72:14 - 72:17)
rules because we've answered that (72:16 - 72:19)
question before you know skyla has you (72:17 - 72:22)
know swanna and pelipper and whatever i (72:19 - 72:23)
don't actually know what her third (72:22 - 72:24)
pokemon is at this point i think it's (72:23 - 72:26)
the non-pheasant (72:24 - 72:30)
uh let's let's strictly mono (72:26 - 72:30)
and then who would be your ace so that (72:30 - 72:34)
that means i couldn't pick like crammer (72:32 - 72:36)
ant because that's water flying so hard (72:34 - 72:39)
to do i can't even think of you can (72:36 - 72:42)
think of three pokemon (72:39 - 72:44)
it is solely monotype (72:42 - 72:48)
what one type (72:44 - 72:48)
that goes against the spirit of pokemon (72:48 - 72:54)
it's the second type that gets you (72:51 - 72:55)
yeah (72:54 - 72:57)
i mean i have it (72:55 - 72:59)
if you're saying i can only have one (72:57 - 73:02)
type all right go for greg huh (72:59 - 73:04)
it's ice (73:02 - 73:06)
okay (73:04 - 73:09)
i have a glacion (73:06 - 73:09)
uh i have (73:09 - 73:12)
a (73:11 - 73:16)
glass writer without a writer (73:12 - 73:16)
and my ace is vanillix (73:16 - 73:20)
but if i'm allowed to break out of that (73:22 - 73:27)
then my team (73:25 - 73:28)
of ice types (73:27 - 73:31)
is frost lass (73:28 - 73:34)
uh frost moth (73:31 - 73:38)
uh ice writer calrix (73:34 - 73:39)
auroras (73:38 - 73:43)
and my aces mamo swing (73:39 - 73:43)
i always end up with the bugs don't i (73:44 - 73:49)
you do you like like no matter how many (73:47 - 73:51)
times i think i'm like oh i love ghosts (73:49 - 73:53)
i love dark i love this i always end up (73:51 - 73:56)
with the bugs and the fire (73:53 - 73:59)
yeah bugs in the fire (73:56 - 74:02)
i mean i do already have a (73:59 - 74:05)
i i guess you'd call it a monobug type (74:02 - 74:06)
team (74:05 - 74:09)
because i've got the frost moth (74:06 - 74:10)
the (74:09 - 74:12)
and they're all shiny right (74:10 - 74:14)
the volcarona (74:12 - 74:16)
who else do i have on that team (74:14 - 74:18)
araquanid (74:16 - 74:20)
the poison (74:18 - 74:23)
scolipede (74:20 - 74:24)
and (74:23 - 74:26)
is there any pure bug type pokemon (74:24 - 74:30)
besides like caterpie metapod (74:26 - 74:30)
probably (74:32 - 74:36)
scyther's bug flying pincer pincer's bug (74:33 - 74:38)
yeah pincers bug only heracross is bug (74:36 - 74:40)
fighting (74:38 - 74:42)

wait wait did you say your ace was greg (75:04 - 75:08)
for which one (75:07 - 75:10)
you're not like if i can only pick ice (75:08 - 75:13)
my ace is vanillux if it's ice by gym (75:10 - 75:15)
rules it's mammal swine since you are (75:13 - 75:17)
not allowing me to pick grass look we've (75:15 - 75:18)
had this question before i'm just trying (75:17 - 75:20)
to mix it up (75:18 - 75:22)
ah (75:20 - 75:23)
mine would be water i would have (75:22 - 75:26)
blastoise particularly gigantomax (75:23 - 75:28)
blastoise that would be my ace (75:26 - 75:30)
i would have (75:28 - 75:31)
um (75:30 - 75:33)
polytode (75:31 - 75:36)
i would have (75:33 - 75:36)
uh (75:36 - 75:42)
probably float soul (75:39 - 75:46)
i would do uh white striped baskelin (75:42 - 75:48)
i would do a wishy-washy for sure (75:46 - 75:49)
um (75:48 - 75:51)

today so thanks (79:47 - 79:52)
thank you so much (79:51 - 79:54)
i will be at tower grove park (79:52 - 79:56)
remembering the time where greg's car (79:54 - 79:57)
broke down (79:56 - 79:58)
uh (79:57 - 80:00)
bringing that up yet you didn't offer (79:58 - 80:02)
your car (80:00 - 80:03)
i will i will say (80:02 - 80:06)
i want okay here's the deal i wanted to (80:03 - 80:08)
fly you said you want you did not want (80:06 - 80:10)
to fly and i said well i don't want to (80:08 - 80:12)
drive and then you and you and will both (80:10 - 80:15)
offered to drive (80:12 - 80:15)
either way i'm just saying at some point (80:16 - 80:22)
let it go dude it was my car and i don't (80:20 - 80:24)
have it anymore it's dead it's my (80:22 - 80:26)
birthday we have contributed to the end (80:24 - 80:29)
of global climate change by reducing the (80:26 - 80:30)
number of therapeutics (80:29 - 80:34)
dead body in my open wound about my car (80:30 - 80:36)
oh look it's not my fault that that that (80:34 - 80:40)
core memory sign st louis and i happen (80:36 - 80:43)
to be going back to st louis uh yeah so (80:40 - 80:45)
i'll be i'll be at tower grove park the (80:43 - 80:46)
the one of the reasons why (80:45 - 80:49)
um is because niantic has been featuring (80:46 - 80:51)
different cities (80:49 - 80:53)
um for these communities and tower grove (80:51 - 80:55)
park has been featured i think two or (80:53 - 80:56)
three times i think tower grove park (80:55 - 80:59)
will always be featured um i think the (80:56 - 81:00)
seattle center in seattle is always (80:59 - 81:03)
featured (81:00 - 81:06)
they did feature jacksonville florida (81:03 - 81:07)
that last time (81:06 - 81:09)
um i don't think it's getting featured (81:07 - 81:11)
this time but the whole point of these (81:09 - 81:13)
featured cities is they're supposed to (81:11 - 81:14)
be like niantic reps there they're (81:13 - 81:16)
supposed to be a niantic booth they're (81:14 - 81:18)
supposed to be like better places to (81:16 - 81:21)
play so i'm going to st louis because it (81:18 - 81:23)
was literally the cheapest one to fly to (81:21 - 81:25)
out of all of all of the (81:23 - 81:28)
the 10 cities they showed off (81:25 - 81:29)
and i wanna know what it's like i wanna (81:28 - 81:31)
i wanna be able to come back next week (81:29 - 81:32)
and be like (81:31 - 81:35)
if you are an hour away if you are two (81:32 - 81:37)
hours away if you are three hours away (81:35 - 81:40)
it is worth driving to this (81:37 - 81:41)
because it is a better pokemon (81:40 - 81:44)
experience and i don't know if that is i (81:41 - 81:46)
don't know if that's true or not like i (81:44 - 81:48)
don't i need to go to figure it out (81:46 - 81:50)
like we're we we the three of us are (81:48 - 81:52)

parks are are in (81:56 - 82:00)
minnesota (81:58 - 82:01)
so (82:00 - 82:04)
whether or not niantic shows is up (82:01 - 82:06)
probably not that big of a deal but (82:04 - 82:07)
if we were (82:06 - 82:09)
close enough to one of these niantic (82:07 - 82:11)
events is it worth traveling to (82:09 - 82:12)

weekend (82:12 - 82:15)
