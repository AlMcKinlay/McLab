uncommon uh Utah Texas and Washington (2:47 - 2:53)

I&#39;ve seen them around not super close by (3:00 - 3:06)
okay yeah oh you know what yeah I&#39;ve (3:04 - 3:08)
seen people travel from California to (3:06 - 3:10)
Oregon in the past to buy just to go (3:08 - 3:12)
like see the vending machines and buy (3:10 - 3:13)
from the vending (3:12 - 3:17)
machines uh for Content they&#39;re saying (3:13 - 3:19)
that vending machines will be at fries (3:17 - 3:22)
Food For Less V&#39;s (3:19 - 3:24)
Ralph&#39;s this now I understand why (3:22 - 3:27)
they&#39;re not in like Wisconsin or (3:24 - 3:28)
Minnesota because we don&#39;t have any of (3:27 - 3:32)
these stores uh Albert Albertson&#39;s (3:28 - 3:35)
Kroger and a couple other you can go to (3:32 - 3:37)
Pokemon&#39;s official website to search up (3:35 - 3:39)
the location near you the vending (3:37 - 3:42)
machines contain TCG products like Elite (3:39 - 3:47)
Trainer Box booster packs and more (3:42 - 3:50)
um I&#39;ve seen a couple I don&#39;t think (3:47 - 3:54)
there&#39;s like anything unique in these (3:50 - 3:57)
machines no they&#39;re kind of neat looking (3:54 - 3:59)
machines they look kind of like mini (3:57 - 4:02)
Pokemon centers kind of uh but they&#39;re (3:59 - 4:03)
just they&#39;re just vending machines with (4:02 - 4:06)
Pokemon cards inside and for a second (4:03 - 4:07)
you said fries and I thought you met the (4:06 - 4:08)
electronic store and I got really (4:07 - 4:10)
excited so did that doesn&#39;t exist (4:08 - 4:13)
anymore okay I was really confused about (4:10 - 4:18)
that one I I clicked on I I it it the (4:13 - 4:19)
article is correct article will be in (4:18 - 4:21)
the show notes you can go to Pokemon (4:19 - 4:24)
support page and you can you can click I (4:21 - 4:29)
clicked on Arizona there is over 30 (4:24 - 4:31)
Fries location in arizonas that have (4:29 - 4:33)
vending machines when they when I (4:31 - 4:35)
originally pinned this article I was (4:33 - 4:38)
like ah that probably means like Arizona (4:35 - 4:40)
Kentucky they get like one vending (4:38 - 4:43)
machine or something they let&#39;s see how (4:40 - 4:46)
many k Kentucky has two four six vending (4:43 - 4:49)
machines in all of Kentucky um at Kroger (4:46 - 4:51)
in Kentucky that&#39;s a lot of vending (4:49 - 4:53)
machines they just like rolled out (4:51 - 4:57)
overnight to Kroger has like uh sorry (4:53 - 4:58)
Georgia has like 50 of these vending (4:57 - 5:00)
machines (4:58 - 5:02)
I think they tested them in the Pacific (5:00 - 5:04)
Northwest area and now they&#39;re rolling (5:02 - 5:06)
them out all across the (5:04 - 5:10)
country that&#39;s pretty insane like what (5:06 - 5:10)
a like Pokemon cards just sit near the (5:11 - 5:17)
checkout in most (5:15 - 5:20)
stores right like that&#39;s is that where (5:17 - 5:21)
your guys&#39; cards are like I go to Target (5:20 - 5:23)
normally and it&#39;s that&#39;s definitely (5:21 - 5:25)
where they are at Target yeah that&#39;s (5:23 - 5:27)
where they are at Target is Target (5:25 - 5:30)
typically uh right near the checkout (5:27 - 5:33)
stands um W when I gosh I haven&#39;t been (5:30 - 5:35)
to Walmart in like seven years but (5:33 - 5:38)
Walmart was also near the (5:35 - 5:40)
checkout sometimes they were in the back (5:38 - 5:42)
by the toys but (5:40 - 5:45)
like almost always my Walmarts were at (5:42 - 5:48)
checkout I don&#39;t honestly I&#39;ve been to a (5:45 - 5:50)
few Walmarts to look for stuff over the (5:48 - 5:52)
last few years and I they never have (5:50 - 5:54)
anything at the Walmarts around me so I (5:52 - 5:56)
wouldn&#39;t know where they I I&#39;ve been to (5:54 - 6:00)
a Walmart twice in my life (5:56 - 6:00)
maybe in if you&#39;re in Colorado king (6:02 - 6:10)
supers that that&#39;s the store you&#39;re (6:08 - 6:13)
going to there&#39;s like 50 (6:10 - 6:16)
locations from Denver to Castle Rock to (6:13 - 6:20)
Aurora to Brighton to Bloomfield to (6:16 - 6:23)
Edgewater to like there&#39;s so many (6:20 - 6:26)
machines they rolled out there&#39;s about (6:23 - 6:28)
11 I want to say 11 or 12 throughout San (6:26 - 6:30)
Diego (6:28 - 6:33)
like you&#39;re not on the list they don&#39;t (6:30 - 6:35)
got Cal oh I see you never mind you&#39;re (6:33 - 6:37)
on the list yeah there are between there (6:35 - 6:40)
are about six different cities within (6:37 - 6:43)
the San Diego County that have uh (6:40 - 6:45)
vending machines that have popped up so (6:43 - 6:47)
you have you have seven in San Diego (6:45 - 6:49)
seven just in the city of San Diego but (6:47 - 6:53)
they&#39;re either at at V&#39;s or Alberts are (6:49 - 6:56)
these are these grocery stores yes so (6:53 - 6:59)
Van&#39;s is Safeway same as Safeway uh (6:56 - 7:01)
Albertson is actually owned by Kroger so (6:59 - 7:03)
Albert SS Ralph&#39;s Kroger that&#39;s all the (7:01 - 7:05)
same company it&#39;s all the same they (7:03 - 7:07)
couldn&#39;t they couldn&#39;t stck a deal with (7:05 - 7:08)
Target they didn&#39;t St a deal with (7:07 - 7:11)
Walmart that&#39;s actually the crazy part I (7:08 - 7:14)
think all of these are grocery stores (7:11 - 7:17)
yeah I would guess so because what is (7:14 - 7:18)
the (7:17 - 7:22)
marketing tactic behind that like well (7:18 - 7:26)
so for me specifically um we have a I (7:22 - 7:27)
have a Ralph&#39;s that&#39;s like right (7:26 - 7:28)
literally like a three minute walk from (7:27 - 7:30)
my house is a Ralph&#39;s that does not have (7:28 - 7:33)
a vending machine unfortunately or maybe (7:30 - 7:36)
fortunately uh the closest one to me is (7:33 - 7:38)
a Vons that&#39;s about you know about a (7:36 - 7:41)
five seven minute drive from my house (7:38 - 7:44)
but that is closer than the nearest (7:41 - 7:47)
Target that I would be going to get (7:44 - 7:49)
cards at there have clearly been a lot (7:47 - 7:52)
of issues not necessarily more recently (7:49 - 7:54)
but over the last four years where uh (7:52 - 7:57)
keeping cards in Secure areas because (7:54 - 8:00)
there were fights or thefts or things (7:57 - 8:02)
like that was becoming a bigger issue so (8:00 - 8:04)
I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if that was part (8:02 - 8:06)
of the thinking of getting these into (8:04 - 8:09)
vending machines as well yeah I mean (8:06 - 8:11)
like the core concept of seeing a (8:09 - 8:13)
Pokemon vending machine and feeling the (8:11 - 8:15)
need to buy from it&#39;s really exciting (8:13 - 8:17)
they look really cool that&#39;s real I was (8:15 - 8:19)
I was at (8:17 - 8:21)
the Pokemon headquarters in (8:19 - 8:24)
bellw and they have vending machines (8:21 - 8:27)
inside their (8:24 - 8:29)
offices the they&#39;re not like any (8:27 - 8:30)
different (8:29 - 8:33)
um than probably these the only I guess (8:30 - 8:34)
the only difference is that those (8:33 - 8:37)
vending machines have employee pricing (8:34 - 8:39)
so you save like I don&#39;t know the 10 to (8:37 - 8:43)
20% employee discount (8:39 - 8:46)
um but (8:43 - 8:48)
like I guess it makes sense why they (8:46 - 8:50)
wouldn&#39;t be in like a Target or a (8:48 - 8:52)
Walmart because they already have a card (8:50 - 8:54)
distributor stocking the (8:52 - 8:58)
shelves and I&#39;m sure grocery stores are (8:54 - 9:02)
probably lesser to work with than like a (8:58 - 9:05)
Target or a (9:02 - 9:08)
Walmart like well you&#39;re you&#39;re asking (9:05 - 9:12)
for a vend like I&#39;m not an expert maybe (9:08 - 9:14)
somebody is an expert but I would assume (9:12 - 9:16)
that like putting a Pokemon vending (9:14 - 9:18)
machine would be the equivalent (9:16 - 9:20)
equivalent of putting like a Pepsi (9:18 - 9:23)
vending machine in a specific area like (9:20 - 9:26)
this area of the grocery store is (9:23 - 9:28)
vending machine (9:26 - 9:31)
area and we have room for a vending (9:28 - 9:32)
machine and there&#39;s no cards being sold (9:31 - 9:35)
in a grocery store so let&#39;s put let&#39;s (9:32 - 9:36)
make a deal to put this card vending (9:35 - 9:38)
machine in the grocery (9:36 - 9:40)
store the grocery stores I&#39;ve seen them (9:38 - 9:43)
in definitely were selling Pokemon cards (9:40 - 9:45)
before Oh really MH yeah I don&#39;t think (9:43 - 9:49)
I&#39;ve like my my grocery stores here in (9:45 - 9:52)
the Midwest is like pick and save Cub (9:49 - 9:54)
Foods Piggly (9:52 - 9:57)
Wiggly never seen Pokemon cards in any (9:54 - 10:00)
of those interesting (9:57 - 10:02)
um the Ralph&#39;s up the street from my (10:00 - 10:05)
house uh it does it used to sell Pokemon (10:02 - 10:10)
cards but only one set at a time so you (10:05 - 10:11)
know lately the latest ones that they (10:10 - 10:13)
had were like silver Tempest um which (10:11 - 10:17)
are fairly old at this point fairly old (10:13 - 10:20)
yeah but uh it&#39;s like a legacy set at (10:17 - 10:23)
this point yeah yeah yeah so they (10:20 - 10:26)
weren&#39;t selling much but I would imagine (10:23 - 10:28)
that the Pokémon company has (10:26 - 10:30)
distribution deals with those (10:28 - 10:32)
Distributors that go to Target and (10:30 - 10:35)
Walmart they might not be able to put (10:32 - 10:37)
the vending machines in those stores (10:35 - 10:38)
when they have the distribution deals (10:37 - 10:41)
with the Distributors so because now (10:38 - 10:42)
they&#39;re competing with the Distributors (10:41 - 10:45)
that are buying from them they might not (10:42 - 10:47)
have the ability to do that in those (10:45 - 10:50)
stores because of their contracts I also (10:47 - 10:51)
can&#39;t even remember I don&#39;t even think (10:50 - 10:54)
target has vending (10:51 - 10:56)
machines like I feel like Walmart does (10:54 - 10:58)
like when you get the like shopping cart (10:56 - 11:01)
in that area there&#39;s like uh Dr Thunder (10:58 - 11:03)
or or (11:01 - 11:07)
like like Mountain crisp or (11:03 - 11:12)
[Laughter] (11:07 - 11:16)
whatever but yeah I don&#39;t I don&#39;t think (11:12 - 11:19)
any Midwest target has a vending (11:16 - 11:21)
machine they&#39;ll have like the Starbucks (11:19 - 11:24)
inside right yeah which is its own like (11:21 - 11:26)
weird agreement like (11:24 - 11:30)
Starbucks Target CS or something (11:26 - 11:32)
something yeah our targets have CVS (11:30 - 11:35)
inside too really Pharmacy oh yeah so (11:32 - 11:37)
like the pharmacy inside Target is not a (11:35 - 11:41)
Target Pharmacy it&#39;s a CVS Pharmacy in (11:37 - 11:43)
Minneapolis at least when I was in (11:41 - 11:46)
Wisconsin that was a Target (11:43 - 11:49)
Pharmacy really yeah it was really (11:46 - 11:52)
weird I I guess I&#39;ve never gone to the (11:49 - 11:55)
pharmacy in my target so I have no idea (11:52 - 11:57)
we also have we have like two Targets (11:55 - 12:00)
also in Minneapolis that are like (11:57 - 12:03)
Walgreens size targets where they&#39;re (12:00 - 12:08)
like mostly like Pharmacy stuff oh uh (12:03 - 12:11)
and like they have like one aisle of (12:08 - 12:13)
electronics and like one aisle of (12:11 - 12:16)
clothing yeah but it&#39;s it&#39;s like mostly (12:13 - 12:18)
Pharmacy and like some food but it if it (12:16 - 12:20)
feels like you&#39;re in a Walgreens except (12:18 - 12:23)
it&#39;s Target is it a is it called a (12:20 - 12:26)
Target Express no it&#39;s just called I I (12:23 - 12:28)
think at one point it might have been (12:26 - 12:29)
called the target Express okay I think (12:28 - 12:31)
they were P well I don&#39;t know if people (12:29 - 12:32)
know this but like Target is from (12:31 - 12:34)
Minneapolis like that&#39;s where the (12:32 - 12:36)
headquarters is so they&#39;ll like they&#39;ll (12:34 - 12:37)
do a lot of like trials like we have (12:36 - 12:40)
Super Targets we have say like super (12:37 - 12:44)
Target as well super large Target it&#39;s a (12:40 - 12:46)
target with like a bigger grocery (12:44 - 12:49)
section yeah oh okay they don&#39;t call (12:46 - 12:50)
them Super Targets out here but we have (12:49 - 12:53)
targets that we have targets that are (12:50 - 12:56)
two floors that just like whole like (12:53 - 12:58)
there&#39;s a whole grocery area and then (12:56 - 13:00)
the the target is like two floors and (12:58 - 13:02)
then we have them that just to have like (13:00 - 13:04)
a grocery a grocery section and like we (13:02 - 13:06)
have targets out of like an alcohol (13:04 - 13:07)
section that is separate it&#39;s like an (13:06 - 13:10)
actual like the whole one part is like (13:07 - 13:12)
walking into a liquor store but it&#39;s (13:10 - 13:14)
Target I&#39;ve seen that yeah we have like (13:12 - 13:15)
one target that&#39;s like that but they (13:14 - 13:17)
don&#39;t name them they&#39;re not named (13:15 - 13:20)
anything different they&#39;re just (13:17 - 13:20)
Target yeah I think they were trying to (13:20 - 13:24)
compete with like Walgreens and CVS at (13:22 - 13:25)
one point with like the smaller targets (13:24 - 13:27)
and then it it didn&#39;t work here so they (13:25 - 13:29)
I don&#39;t think they tried it anywhere (13:27 - 13:30)
else (13:29 - 13:32)
hm we definitely there is one target (13:30 - 13:35)
called Target Express that (13:32 - 13:38)
is uh in one of the neighborhoods it&#39;s (13:35 - 13:41)
just it&#39;s a very small Target yeah there (13:38 - 13:43)
are definitely a couple of small targets (13:41 - 13:46)
that I&#39;ve seen that&#39;s crazy yeah I had (13:43 - 13:48)
nothing in my area is Target (13:46 - 13:50)
Express again it might have been called (13:48 - 13:52)
Target Express like four or five years (13:50 - 13:54)
ago and how many of these have Pokemon (13:52 - 13:56)
cards no yeah the well the the small (13:54 - 13:58)
targets do have Pokemon cards none of (13:56 - 14:00)
these have any (13:58 - 14:02)
machines I think the problem with (14:00 - 14:06)
America is we don&#39;t have enough vending (14:02 - 14:07)
machines (14:06 - 14:11)
honestly honestly I might agree not the (14:07 - 14:13)
problem but a problem um the only (14:11 - 14:16)
problem in America nowadays it&#39;s not (14:13 - 14:18)
enough this is what I&#39;ll run my (14:16 - 14:21)
political campaign on we need more (14:18 - 14:24)
vending machines in this country it&#39;ll (14:21 - 14:27)
fix everything when you go to Japan the (14:24 - 14:29)
vending machines are so good they&#39;re so (14:27 - 14:31)
good especially in the winter or anytime (14:29 - 14:33)
it&#39;s cold and you want something warm (14:31 - 14:35)
and they have warm things into in (14:33 - 14:38)
vending machines you just don&#39;t find (14:35 - 14:43)
that here yeah a lot of the time (14:38 - 14:43)
yeah yeah it&#39;s a bit of a bummer but but (14:44 - 14:48)
now you have Pokemon cards in your (14:47 - 14:50)
vending machines we have a lot of (14:48 - 14:53)
Pokemon vending machines existing I do I (14:50 - 14:55)
didn&#39;t think about the theft (14:53 - 14:57)
conversation that was interesting that (14:55 - 15:01)
you brought that up because yeah if (14:57 - 15:01)
uh I told my Lau story right yes and (15:02 - 15:08)
there&#39;s there&#39;s like so many pop Marts (15:05 - 15:10)
in the United States actually there was (15:08 - 15:12)
one in bellw when I was in bellev and I (15:10 - 15:15)
was like oh there&#39;s a pop store here um (15:12 - 15:19)
there is a pop vending machine in (15:15 - 15:22)
Minneapolis and every time I go to it (15:19 - 15:25)
it&#39;s just always sold out like they&#39;re (15:22 - 15:26)
supposed to have (15:25 - 15:30)
labu but it&#39;s always sold out (15:26 - 15:32)
out but I (15:30 - 15:35)
suppose like there&#39;s a pro and con of (15:32 - 15:37)
that right like the pro is you just (15:35 - 15:39)
can&#39;t have somebody run up and like grab (15:37 - 15:41)
the whole shelf or you don&#39;t need to (15:39 - 15:44)
like cue people for that right like you (15:41 - 15:46)
don&#39;t have the Pokemon fist fights that (15:44 - 15:48)
were happening when you put out silver (15:46 - 15:50)
Tempest no one was fist fighting over (15:48 - 15:51)
silver (15:50 - 15:53)
[Laughter] (15:51 - 15:56)
Tempest um but the other problem is you (15:53 - 15:57)
don&#39;t know when it&#39;s restocked and if (15:56 - 15:58)
somebody goes to the vending machine and (15:57 - 16:00)
they just want everything they&#39;re just (15:58 - 16:01)
going to sit there and order everything (16:00 - 16:04)
out of the machine yeah but that&#39;s not a (16:01 - 16:06)
problem unique to the vending machine (16:04 - 16:08)
and honestly I much prefer the vending (16:06 - 16:12)
machine to a shelf that is completely (16:08 - 16:13)
locked up with a key that you have to go (16:12 - 16:16)
and ask someone to unlock no I agree I (16:13 - 16:18)
wonder if vending machine technology is (16:16 - 16:19)
smart enough to be (16:18 - 16:23)
like you can only use your card yeah (16:19 - 16:24)
like you can only use your card here (16:23 - 16:25)
like (16:24 - 16:28)
twice so you could use another (16:25 - 16:30)
card yeah (16:28 - 16:33)
I don&#39;t I&#39;m sure it would be but that&#39;s (16:30 - 16:34)
but what do they care just like they (16:33 - 16:36)
want to sell the product there don&#39;t (16:34 - 16:37)
seem to be limits on the vending (16:36 - 16:40)
machines from what I&#39;ve seen like and (16:37 - 16:41)
you don&#39;t and you don&#39;t have to buy one (16:40 - 16:43)
product at a time you can you add to a (16:41 - 16:45)
cart and then you pay for it all at once (16:43 - 16:47)
and then it distributes each item one at (16:45 - 16:50)
a time but it&#39;s not like you have to buy (16:47 - 16:53)
something get it buy something else get (16:50 - 16:54)
it you can like add it all to a cart and (16:53 - 16:56)
then it it all at once these are smart (16:54 - 16:59)
pending machines um yeah but they have a (16:56 - 17:02)
big huge screen on the front I mean (16:59 - 17:05)
target has limits still like there are (17:02 - 17:06)
limits to buy my target still has limits (17:05 - 17:09)
for only like okay they don&#39;t seem to be (17:06 - 17:12)
limits on Pokemon product anymore at (17:09 - 17:15)
least the target I just went to and B (17:12 - 17:17)
Pokemon product app there didn&#39;t seem to (17:15 - 17:18)
be a limit there but there were limits (17:17 - 17:21)
on other sets of trading cards that are (17:18 - 17:22)
more popular right now or you know that (17:21 - 17:24)
are (17:22 - 17:27)
um it&#39;s just more popular I guess but (17:24 - 17:30)
there are definitely still limits and (17:27 - 17:31)
I don&#39;t know if they would do that with (17:30 - 17:33)
the vending machines like I think (17:31 - 17:37)
Prismatic Evolutions will be a great uh (17:33 - 17:39)
test to see if they do limits because I (17:37 - 17:41)
do think that will be a very popular set (17:39 - 17:43)
and if I can just go down the street to (17:41 - 17:45)
the vending machine and they&#39;re just (17:43 - 17:47)
constantly stocked with Prismatic (17:45 - 17:49)
Evolutions that&#39;d be great but I don&#39;t (17:47 - 17:52)
know how often they&#39;re like restocking (17:49 - 17:56)
those things either or how much is in (17:52 - 17:56)
there yeah I mean like there&#39;s like a (17:57 - 18:03)
hidden big business behind that right (18:01 - 18:04)
they would have had to hire a company to (18:03 - 18:06)
make all of these vending machines and (18:04 - 18:09)
then ideally Pokemon has to hire people (18:06 - 18:12)
to then restock these vending machines (18:09 - 18:14)
and ideally they&#39;re printing more (18:12 - 18:16)
product to put into these vending (18:14 - 18:19)
machines again before I really pulled up (18:16 - 18:21)
this article I was like ah like two (18:19 - 18:23)
vending machines per state or something (18:21 - 18:25)
because that&#39;s how it always was when I (18:23 - 18:27)
was when I originally a couple years ago (18:25 - 18:29)
went to Seattle (18:27 - 18:32)
and I met up with uh my friend steel she (18:29 - 18:34)
was like there&#39;s like three vending (18:32 - 18:36)
machines in the state let&#39;s go visit one (18:34 - 18:38)
I was like yeah let&#39;s go like make a an (18:36 - 18:39)
evening out of that and then you look (18:38 - 18:41)
and you&#39;re like ah Kentucky has like 30 (18:39 - 18:44)
of them and like that&#39;s crazy like that (18:41 - 18:45)
that didn&#39;t exist like well Kentucky (18:44 - 18:47)
doesn&#39;t have 30 they have like eight but (18:45 - 18:48)
that (18:47 - 18:51)
like I&#39;m telling you though didn&#39;t exist (18:48 - 18:53)
like three years ago five years ago in (18:51 - 18:56)
the county of San Diego which covers (18:53 - 18:58)
about I don&#39;t know if I I could go like (18:56 - 19:00)
40 miles north of where I live and I&#39;m (18:58 - 19:02)
still in the county of San Diego there&#39;s (19:00 - 19:04)
multiple cities within the county of San (19:02 - 19:07)
Diego I think there&#39;s like 13 or 14 (19:04 - 19:09)
locations that have vending machines (19:07 - 19:12)
within that span so like yeah they&#39;re (19:09 - 19:15)
defit are they by the the door like (19:12 - 19:19)
after checkout yeah typically near the (19:15 - 19:22)
door right near the (19:19 - 19:22)
door it&#39;s (19:24 - 19:29)
cool I don&#39;t think it&#39;s like a bad thing (19:25 - 19:31)
more accessibility to Pokemon cards more (19:29 - 19:34)
accessibility to get your kids addicted (19:31 - 19:36)
to (19:34 - 19:38)
cardboard yeah and they&#39;re just they&#39;re (19:36 - 19:40)
fun to see I honestly love walking into (19:38 - 19:42)
one of the grocery stores with them and (19:40 - 19:44)
just seeing this big Pokemon machine (19:42 - 19:46)
even if I&#39;m not buying anything from (19:44 - 19:48)
it it&#39;s another one of those little it&#39;s (19:46 - 19:52)
nice to see Pokemon in the wild like (19:48 - 19:55)
that did and none of none of the ones (19:52 - 19:56)
near you Bobby have (19:55 - 19:59)
plushes just cards I believe (19:56 - 20:01)
okay cuz the one the one I was talking (19:59 - 20:03)
about in Seattle it had like cards and (20:01 - 20:05)
plushes but I think those are (20:03 - 20:08)
technically like Pokemon Center machines (20:05 - 20:09)
I think these are too though these (20:08 - 20:12)
aren&#39;t these aren&#39;t like these aren&#39;t um (20:09 - 20:14)
other Distributors like these are coming (20:12 - 20:17)
directly from the Pokemon company right (20:14 - 20:19)
right right right right but (20:17 - 20:22)
I I feel like everything now is just (20:19 - 20:24)
pure (20:22 - 20:27)
TCG whereas like the original ones in (20:24 - 20:30)
Washington were like half TCG half (20:27 - 20:32)
plushes I mean there&#39;s like different (20:30 - 20:33)
vending machines in Japan too like (20:32 - 20:35)
there&#39;s one at the airport where it&#39;s (20:33 - 20:38)
like exclusive airport merchandise that (20:35 - 20:41)
you can only get there um they have them (20:38 - 20:44)
in Korea too I didn&#39;t talk about this (20:41 - 20:46)
but they have Pokemon card vending (20:44 - 20:50)
machines in Korea and it was like a (20:46 - 20:54)
thousand W for a pack of cards uh which (20:50 - 20:55)
their packs are also just like five (20:54 - 20:58)
cards like Japan mhm or like TCG pocket (20:55 - 20:59)
five cards (20:58 - 21:01)
and I (20:59 - 21:05)
I I opened a pack and I was like this (21:01 - 21:10)
quality of cardboard is so bad it&#39;s (21:05 - 21:12)
terrible oh really so I I ripped the (21:10 - 21:14)
card in half to check the (21:12 - 21:17)
inside and I was like I can&#39;t tell if (21:14 - 21:19)
this is fake or not because I don&#39;t have (21:17 - 21:21)
a real card to compare to oh no it was a (21:19 - 21:24)
bad pack anyways so I went into the (21:21 - 21:28)
store and I bought a booster box which (21:24 - 21:30)
their booster boxes are really tiny so (21:28 - 21:32)
it was only like 30 bucks for how like (21:30 - 21:36)
what 30 packs or whatever yeah um and I (21:32 - 21:38)
opened the booster box and then I ripped (21:36 - 21:41)
another card in half to like see the (21:38 - 21:43)
inside that&#39;s how you tell it it&#39;s fake (21:41 - 21:45)
it&#39;s the inside of the card yeah and (21:43 - 21:46)
they were the (21:45 - 21:49)
same and it just made me (21:46 - 21:52)
realize how badly printed I don&#39;t know (21:49 - 21:54)
what distributor they use to make Korean (21:52 - 21:57)
Pokemon cards but they&#39;re terrible (21:54 - 21:59)
quality they look they legitimately look (21:57 - 22:03)
fake and I feel like a couple years ago (21:59 - 22:05)
they were not this bad quality the only (22:03 - 22:06)
reason I bring that up is one just to (22:05 - 22:08)
tell a story about ripping Pokemon cards (22:06 - 22:10)
in half but two the Pokemon company in (22:08 - 22:13)
the United States did switch (22:10 - 22:16)
printers like two years ago they like (22:13 - 22:19)
bought a printing (22:16 - 22:23)
company and I can&#39;t I&#39;ll be the first to (22:19 - 22:25)
say I don&#39;t think the quality got much (22:23 - 22:27)
better like I think cards are still (22:25 - 22:29)
pretty off-centered (22:27 - 22:31)
Bobby you open more cards than I do are (22:29 - 22:33)
they I don&#39;t know I feel like the (22:31 - 22:35)
quality has gotten slightly better over (22:33 - 22:38)
time you think I can&#39;t speak to like (22:35 - 22:40)
Korean cards or Japanese I mean japanese (22:38 - 22:41)
cards are always people always say those (22:40 - 22:43)
are the best the best quality are the (22:41 - 22:46)
Japanese cards but I I agree I do think (22:43 - 22:49)
Japanese they they just feel thicker too (22:46 - 22:51)
well they have so like do they have that (22:49 - 22:53)
does do the Korean cards have that third (22:51 - 22:56)
layer cuz like the jet like the when you (22:53 - 22:58)
rip an English card you can tell because (22:56 - 22:59)
if it&#39;s fake or not because of the (22:58 - 23:02)
layers in the in the middle of the card (22:59 - 23:05)
and there&#39;s like a third layer that (23:02 - 23:08)
isn&#39;t in fake cards basically um I mean (23:05 - 23:10)
the Korean cards had the the middle (23:08 - 23:12)
layer because it was like a blue color (23:10 - 23:14)
yeah so you can see all three layers (23:12 - 23:18)
right they just felt they they felt (23:14 - 23:20)
um (23:18 - 23:24)
thinner and the print quality felt like (23:20 - 23:26)
more like somebody forgot to put at like (23:24 - 23:29)
300 DPI like somebody accidentally like (23:26 - 23:31)
kept it on 72 DPI when they went to go (23:29 - 23:33)
hit print what&#39;s interesting to me in (23:31 - 23:37)
that regard is take a card like the (23:33 - 23:40)
Umbreon from evolving Skies it&#39;s worth (23:37 - 23:42)
like a ,000 dollar ungraded in English (23:40 - 23:45)
and I think even more in Japanese but (23:42 - 23:47)
you can buy the Korean version of that (23:45 - 23:49)
card for like 300 bucks it&#39;s literally (23:47 - 23:52)
like a third of the cost of the English (23:49 - 23:55)
card and that Umbreon isn&#39;t a playable (23:52 - 23:56)
card people aren&#39;t buying that Umbreon (23:55 - 23:57)
because it&#39;s playable they&#39;re buying (23:56 - 23:59)
that Umbreon to collect it (23:57 - 24:00)
um but it&#39;s like a third of the cost in (23:59 - 24:02)
Korean and I wonder if it has to do with (24:00 - 24:04)
the quality because I&#39;ve always wondered (24:02 - 24:06)
about that like why not just buy it did (24:04 - 24:08)
you just rip a card yes yeah yeah yeah (24:06 - 24:10)
yeah no I ripped a I ripped just a (24:08 - 24:13)
common Pikachu from uh a Pikachu you (24:10 - 24:18)
ripped a Pikachu on a Pokemon podcast I (24:13 - 24:20)
was doing some ASMR yeah so you can you (24:18 - 24:22)
can see the you can see the third layer (24:20 - 24:25)
right you have the top you have like (24:22 - 24:27)
this gray layer and then you have the (24:25 - 24:30)
back layer yeah fake doesn&#39;t have the (24:27 - 24:32)
black or the gray right and the Korean (24:30 - 24:35)
cards had the inside layer was blue like (24:32 - 24:38)
a bright blue MH and that&#39;s where I was (24:35 - 24:40)
like I definitely know English cards are (24:38 - 24:43)
not bright blue in the center right so (24:40 - 24:46)
that&#39;s why I had to go buy packs inside (24:43 - 24:47)
the store because I was like this could (24:46 - 24:49)
just be a fake vending machine like (24:47 - 24:51)
those exist like there are so many (24:49 - 24:55)
vending machines in Japan that are (24:51 - 25:01)
reselling open booster packs m in like (24:55 - 25:03)
but they try to make them look official (25:01 - 25:07)
but it&#39;s like chance for Charizard EX (25:03 - 25:10)
full art rainbow rare a one in 20 chance (25:07 - 25:13)
and then it&#39;s just like (25:10 - 25:15)
a America does this too just not (25:13 - 25:18)
inventing machine form like we call them (25:15 - 25:22)
mystery boxes mystery boxes (25:18 - 25:22)
yeah (25:22 - 25:25)
yeah uh but yeah I bought I bought (25:25 - 25:30)
Korean cards (25:27 - 25:33)
a bunch of Korean cards like uh two or (25:30 - 25:35)
three years ago and I felt like they had (25:33 - 25:37)
good quality and now I don&#39;t know again (25:35 - 25:38)
I don&#39;t know if they also changed distri (25:37 - 25:41)
beers but I was shocked the last time I (25:38 - 25:44)
was in Korea I was like oh this (25:41 - 25:46)
something different (25:44 - 25:48)
here maybe they twitch printers or (25:46 - 25:50)
something and they&#39;re just not as good (25:48 - 25:54)
quality now I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t know (25:50 - 25:56)
that I own any Korean Pokemon cards (25:54 - 25:59)
definitely own Japanese ones definitely (25:56 - 26:02)
on English ones or you know but um don&#39;t (25:59 - 26:03)
know that I have any Korean Pokemon (26:02 - 26:06)
cards well Indonesian Pokemon cards are (26:03 - 26:08)
also relatively new because they&#39;re (26:06 - 26:11)
doing a big push that I was in Indonesia (26:08 - 26:13)
too I did not buy any Indonesian Pokemon (26:11 - 26:15)
cards I actually yeah I should have I (26:13 - 26:18)
don&#39;t know why I didn&#39;t oh very foolish (26:15 - 26:20)
of me I could be ripping an Indonesia (26:18 - 26:23)
Pokemon card to see what&#39;s on the (26:20 - 26:25)
inside yeah I don&#39;t know instead you (26:23 - 26:28)
ripped a Pikachu of all the cards you (26:25 - 26:29)
could have ripped open (26:28 - 26:31)
I had a I had a reverse Holo dearling I (26:29 - 26:34)
thought about that for a (26:31 - 26:37)
second uh all right let&#39;s (26:34 - 26:40)
uh speaking of Pokemon cards let&#39;s take (26:37 - 26:42)
a quick break and then we&#39;ll come back (26:40 - 26:44)
and we&#39;ll talk about Pokemon pocket we (26:42 - 26:48)
will be right back and we are back from (26:44 - 26:49)
our (26:48 - 26:52)
break uh by the time (26:49 - 26:54)
we it&#39;s been a it&#39;s it&#39;s been a couple (26:52 - 26:57)
days maybe 10 12 days since this news (26:54 - 26:59)
came out and we&#39;re recording so so (26:57 - 27:01)
number could be different still think (26:59 - 27:04)
it&#39;s newsworthy though the official (27:01 - 27:07)
Pokemon pocket Twitter (27:04 - 27:12)
tweeted that uh 30 million downloads (27:07 - 27:14)
worldwide of the (27:12 - 27:18)
game pretty (27:14 - 27:18)
good uh I don&#39;t (27:18 - 27:23)
have like (27:21 - 27:25)
sleep (27:23 - 27:27)
unite (27:25 - 27:29)
Masters I don&#39;t think anyone thought (27:27 - 27:30)
this was going to be Pokemon go cuz (27:29 - 27:32)
Pokemon go is pro if I was to guess (27:30 - 27:33)
Pokemon go is probably like 50 million (27:32 - 27:37)
or something crazy like that uh yeah I (27:33 - 27:41)
don&#39;t know but 30 million (27:37 - 27:44)
downloads for the first what week of the (27:41 - 27:46)
game and (27:44 - 27:48)
then (27:46 - 27:50)
polygon is (27:48 - 27:53)
reporting that Pokemon Trading Card Game (27:50 - 27:54)
made $12 (27:53 - 27:56)
million (27:54 - 27:59)
already which is that is that more than (27:56 - 28:01)
Pokemon sleep made in a a year I don&#39;t (27:59 - 28:03)
remember what our Pokemon sleep news was (28:01 - 28:05)
was that like 10 million in a (28:03 - 28:09)
year was it I don&#39;t (28:05 - 28:11)
remember I&#39;m not seeing numbers for (28:09 - 28:13)
Pokemon sleep but I am seeing that they (28:11 - 28:16)
celebrated 20 million downloads for (28:13 - 28:17)
Pokemon (28:16 - 28:21)
sleep in a year no no no no (28:17 - 28:25)
no I was like geez no one likes to sleep (28:21 - 28:27)
actually maybe in a (28:25 - 28:29)
year try to see (28:27 - 28:32)
yeah actually quite possibly only 20 (28:29 - 28:34)
million in a year I think that might be (28:32 - 28:35)
what this (28:34 - 28:38)
says (28:35 - 28:43)
huh well yeah released in July 2023 and (28:38 - 28:44)
this article on the Pokemon sleep News (28:43 - 28:49)
website came out in June 2024 they were (28:44 - 28:50)
celebrating reaching 20 million (28:49 - 28:53)
downloads in a in almost a year okay so (28:50 - 28:54)
that&#39;s Pokemon (28:53 - 28:59)
sleep all right I mean good for 20 (28:54 - 29:03)
million in a year but so pocket just did (28:59 - 29:06)
that did 30 million in in the week less (29:03 - 29:10)
a week probably yeah okay I mean I&#39;m not (29:06 - 29:12)
surprised I had two friends who are only (29:10 - 29:15)
kind of C very casual Pokemon players (29:12 - 29:17)
both of them sent me their TCG pocket (29:15 - 29:19)
friend codes before I had even gotten (29:17 - 29:22)
the chance to download the game yeah (29:19 - 29:23)
yeah so I&#39;m I&#39;m not surprised by these (29:22 - 29:26)
numbers yeah Pokemon (29:23 - 29:27)
cards I don&#39;t know if anybody&#39;s been (29:26 - 29:31)
around for the last four years very (29:27 - 29:33)
popular uh (29:31 - 29:35)
so yeah (29:33 - 29:39)
I uh so the the the 12 million is (29:35 - 29:41)
reported by uh an (29:39 - 29:46)
analytics website so the Pokemon company (29:41 - 29:48)
is not coming out and saying they made (29:46 - 29:50)
12 million they will probably at some (29:48 - 29:52)
point to their investors come out and (29:50 - 29:54)
say how much money they made so their (29:52 - 29:58)
investors are happy so I will say like (29:54 - 29:59)
take that number with like a grain of (29:58 - 30:03)
salt because they&#39;re looking at Trends (29:59 - 30:04)
and they&#39;re (30:03 - 30:06)
predicting how much (30:04 - 30:09)
money that this app made and we all have (30:06 - 30:10)
learned in the last couple weeks that (30:09 - 30:13)
predictions aren&#39;t actually accurate um (30:10 - 30:15)
okay (30:13 - 30:17)
but business transaction type (30:15 - 30:20)
predictions are different in a lot of (30:17 - 30:22)
ways but yeah AR they aren&#39;t they&#39;re not (30:20 - 30:24)
they&#39;re never those numbers aren&#39;t (30:22 - 30:27)
typically way off from where they are (30:24 - 30:29)
like I don&#39;t think Pokemon compan going (30:27 - 30:31)
to come out in a few months with their (30:29 - 30:35)
quarterly numbers and be like ah pocket (30:31 - 30:38)
made 10 times less than like that than (30:35 - 30:40)
that I was going to say the opposite I (30:38 - 30:41)
was going to say that these numbers are (30:40 - 30:44)
probably conservative I I I think I (30:41 - 30:47)
think they made (30:44 - 30:47)
more I I I mean (30:47 - 30:53)
like they haven&#39;t gotten your money yet (30:51 - 30:56)
Bobby well once they (30:53 - 30:56)
do once the triggers next week Bobby&#39;s (30:56 - 31:02)
going to be like yeah I&#39;m $200 deep I (31:00 - 31:06)
don&#39;t think I don&#39;t no I don&#39;t think so (31:02 - 31:09)
but uh polygon is also saying that for (31:06 - 31:12)
context Pokemon go generated (31:09 - 31:18)
one 143 million in profit during 2016 (31:12 - 31:21)
which is the year they debuted yeah and (31:18 - 31:24)
that was in July that they debuted so (31:21 - 31:26)
and and that game was that game was (31:24 - 31:29)
nothing not not not not saying it was (31:26 - 31:31)
bad but just like the first year of (31:29 - 31:36)
Pokemon go was so shallow as a game yeah (31:31 - 31:39)
but that also made it easier to approach (31:36 - 31:42)
oh that&#39;s true yeah like now I feel like (31:39 - 31:44)
if somebody&#39;s like installing Pokemon go (31:42 - 31:46)
for the first time it&#39;s like (31:44 - 31:50)
overwhelming where do I even start yeah (31:46 - 31:52)
I I didn&#39;t even spend any money in (31:50 - 31:54)
Pokemon go for the first three months (31:52 - 31:56)
that that game was around yeah I&#39;m (31:54 - 31:57)
trying to even think of what there was (31:56 - 31:59)
to really spend money (31:57 - 32:01)
incubators for me I went to Japan and (31:59 - 32:04)
wanted to hatch a farfetched that was (32:01 - 32:05)
the first time I put money into it cuz I (32:04 - 32:07)
was like farfetched could have hatched (32:05 - 32:08)
from the 5K eggs at the time and could (32:07 - 32:11)
only be in that region right so that was (32:08 - 32:12)
the first thing that got me to spend (32:11 - 32:14)
money was trying to hatch a farfetched (32:12 - 32:17)
which did not happen I caught one but I (32:14 - 32:19)
did not hatch one I think I put $20 in (32:17 - 32:23)
the first day and I think I upgraded (32:19 - 32:25)
storage and item space right away (32:23 - 32:29)
because you could do that okay yes yep (32:25 - 32:33)
2016 me was like July 2016 me was like (32:29 - 32:35)
I&#39;m not putting money into this mobile (32:33 - 32:39)
game yeah never never never bought (32:35 - 32:41)
pokeballs um incense you could buy (32:39 - 32:45)
incense mhm uh incubators there were no (32:41 - 32:46)
raid (32:45 - 32:48)
passes I don&#39;t even think there were (32:46 - 32:51)
star pieces I think star pieces came a (32:48 - 32:53)
couple months are still (32:51 - 32:55)
relatively (32:53 - 32:57)
what star pieces are still relatively (32:55 - 32:59)
recent (32:57 - 33:01)
no no star peses were in the first year (32:59 - 33:03)
of the game I think no you guys are both (33:01 - 33:05)
it&#39;s you&#39;re in the it&#39;s in the split in (33:03 - 33:06)
the middle they&#39;re not that recent but (33:05 - 33:09)
they&#39;re not that old what they&#39;re (33:06 - 33:11)
like lucky eggs were day one because (33:09 - 33:14)
people were buying them by the truck (33:11 - 33:16)
load to like get to 40 as fast as (33:14 - 33:18)
possible (33:16 - 33:20)
yeah star pieces would say star pieces (33:18 - 33:22)
were maybe 2020 no they were while we (33:20 - 33:24)
were still while we were no they were (33:22 - 33:28)
before 2020 were star pieces the around (33:24 - 33:30)
the time that raids came out which was a (33:28 - 33:32)
year later no they weren&#39;t in the very (33:30 - 33:36)
beginning star pieces weren&#39;t a we have (33:32 - 33:39)
the someone&#39;s got to be able to find I (33:36 - 33:41)
think just speculating and wasting time (33:39 - 33:45)
in the podcast is the proper way to do (33:41 - 33:45)
this uh no I I think the number is (33:46 - 33:51)
conservative like I I I would imagine (33:49 - 33:54)
that it probably made more than 12 (33:51 - 33:56)
million I don&#39;t think (33:54 - 34:01)
it&#39;s I I know I guess I don&#39;t know the (33:56 - 34:03)
the website reporting which is at Magic (34:01 - 34:07)
I don&#39;t know if they&#39;re normally under (34:03 - 34:10)
or normally over I don&#39;t know what like (34:07 - 34:12)
their their history is I guess it (34:10 - 34:14)
doesn&#39;t matter too (34:12 - 34:17)
much because we will eventually get (34:14 - 34:18)
numbers and (34:17 - 34:22)
then like a week or even two weeks of (34:18 - 34:25)
data doesn&#39;t (34:22 - 34:28)
feel legitimate enough because because (34:25 - 34:31)
the game is so new MH whereas it&#39;s like (34:28 - 34:33)
okay this game&#39;s been around for 6 (34:31 - 34:36)
months how is that holding up to genin (34:33 - 34:37)
impact that&#39;s been around for a couple (34:36 - 34:39)
years or hanai that&#39;s been around for a (34:37 - 34:41)
couple years or even Pokemon go that&#39;s (34:39 - 34:43)
been around for eight years like right (34:41 - 34:46)
say what you will about Pokemon go still (34:43 - 34:48)
makes a lot of money I think last time I (34:46 - 34:50)
checked like a week ago it was the (34:48 - 34:53)
number Eighth most grossing app in the (34:50 - 34:55)
app store eight years later it also had (34:53 - 34:58)
the whole gigantamax event recently um (34:55 - 34:59)
it looks like Star pieces were (34:58 - 35:02)
introduced at the very very end of 2017 (34:59 - 35:04)
yeah (35:02 - 35:07)
201 201 a year and a (35:04 - 35:10)
half yeah because the game came out (35:07 - 35:12)
summer of 2016 yeah yeah so a year and a (35:10 - 35:14)
half in so that&#39;s actually older than (35:12 - 35:16)
you were closer than I was I thought it (35:14 - 35:18)
was yeah that&#39;s definitely older than I (35:16 - 35:21)
thought (35:18 - 35:21)
but what was the point of finding that (35:22 - 35:27)
out oh I don&#39;t know I guess I just I&#39;m (35:24 - 35:29)
just just trying to we were talking (35:27 - 35:33)
could buy yeah yeah so Pokémon go made (35:29 - 35:36)
143 million in the first year there was (35:33 - 35:38)
not a lot to buy but it still made a ton (35:36 - 35:41)
of money I would argue there is a lot to (35:38 - 35:42)
buy in (35:41 - 35:44)
Pocket because you&#39;re buying your (35:42 - 35:46)
complete collection (35:44 - 35:49)
yeah the there&#39;s not a lot of the stores (35:46 - 35:51)
but but you can keep going with the (35:49 - 35:58)
packs yeah right yeah like (35:51 - 35:58)
when we finished recording the other day (35:59 - 36:04)
we were talking about whale (36:02 - 36:08)
players and the way to tell somebody is (36:04 - 36:11)
whaling in this game I guess for context (36:08 - 36:13)
a whale player is a player that would (36:11 - 36:16)
put a lot of money into the game it (36:13 - 36:18)
would be more than like (36:16 - 36:21)
$100 it would be a lot yeah but there&#39;s (36:18 - 36:24)
the there is like a whale collection in (36:21 - 36:26)
the game which is that black and white (36:24 - 36:28)
collection not like the game black and (36:26 - 36:29)
white but like (36:28 - 36:33)
the like the black and silverish playmat (36:29 - 36:35)
and the coin and the sleeves like really (36:33 - 36:37)
good that is like the whale stuff so if (36:35 - 36:41)
you were against a player that has those (36:37 - 36:45)
sleeves or that coin or the playmat they (36:41 - 36:47)
have probably put in they have (36:45 - 36:48)
definitely put in way more money than (36:47 - 36:51)
you most likely not definitely they (36:48 - 36:52)
could have gotten really really really (36:51 - 36:55)
really really (36:52 - 36:58)
lucky could have three gold cards three (36:55 - 37:00)
gold cards can get you well three of the (36:58 - 37:02)
same gold card can get you that entire (37:00 - 37:05)
set yep if you crush it if you want to (37:02 - 37:08)
crush down two of them yeah so the the (37:05 - 37:10)
way to even get that set is sorry you (37:08 - 37:14)
can take 400 of the shop tickets and (37:10 - 37:16)
turn that into one gold ticket but the (37:14 - 37:20)
cheapest item you can get is six gold so (37:16 - 37:24)
you would need a lot of shop (37:20 - 37:26)
tickets yeah no I think that shop (37:24 - 37:28)
tickets are the wrong way to go go about (37:26 - 37:31)
that 100% pulling the packs and can you (37:28 - 37:33)
get those items with pack (37:31 - 37:36)
points the the those cards no no you (37:33 - 37:38)
can&#39;t with pack points okay I hadn&#39;t (37:36 - 37:40)
even looked then yeah just (37:38 - 37:43)
packs you can actually they&#39;re 2500 pack (37:40 - 37:46)
points for a gold card okay oh you&#39;re (37:43 - 37:48)
saying you use the pack points to get a (37:46 - 37:50)
gold card and then crush the gold card (37:48 - 37:52)
yep yeah I see I don&#39;t think that&#39;s (37:50 - 37:54)
worth it either I think it&#39;s more (37:52 - 37:57)
efficient than buying them through the (37:54 - 38:00)
shop it&#39;s 7500 pack (37:57 - 38:04)
points right so you have to get 75 okay (38:00 - 38:05)
let&#39;s just let&#39;s just say from the very (38:04 - 38:07)
beginning you don&#39;t have any gold cards (38:05 - 38:09)
the the purpose of this is that if you (38:07 - 38:11)
when you go to obtain flare with a gold (38:09 - 38:13)
card if you get the special tickets (38:11 - 38:16)
instead one gold card is worth 64 of (38:13 - 38:18)
those special tickets hold on we should (38:16 - 38:20)
probably explain (38:18 - 38:22)
crushing so yeah since that that (38:20 - 38:24)
terminology is not actually used in this (38:22 - 38:26)
app (38:24 - 38:32)
true so if you have more than two of a (38:26 - 38:37)
card you can then delete any extra cards (38:32 - 38:39)
you have and get it turned into (38:37 - 38:43)
different currency or you need multiple (38:39 - 38:46)
versions of that c to add (38:43 - 38:48)
flare and as of right now I think the (38:46 - 38:50)
three of us agree that flare isn&#39;t that (38:48 - 38:52)
impressive or worth it currently in it&#39;s (38:50 - 38:56)
its current state yeah and the more rare (38:52 - 38:59)
your card is the more the better (38:56 - 39:01)
currency you get when you crush it which (38:59 - 39:04)
is ultimately throwing that card away (39:01 - 39:06)
for currency it&#39;s like throwing away (39:04 - 39:08)
your Bulbasaur to Professor Oak and then (39:06 - 39:09)
you get like two Bulbasaur (39:08 - 39:12)
candy or whatever when you I don&#39;t even (39:09 - 39:13)
do you just get one or two I don&#39;t even (39:12 - 39:15)
remember in Pokemon go I think it&#39;s like (39:13 - 39:17)
a chance of (39:15 - 39:20)
two but like you always get one what no (39:17 - 39:22)
it&#39;s a chance of an XL candy or (39:20 - 39:24)
something right oh yeah yeah yeah yeah (39:22 - 39:25)
when you&#39;re like throwing away Pokemon (39:24 - 39:29)
on Pokemon go yeah so if you throw away (39:25 - 39:31)
like an immersive (39:29 - 39:33)
card which is probably the easiest to (39:31 - 39:34)
understand because there&#39;s only three (39:33 - 39:36)
immersive cards you could throw away (39:34 - 39:38)
Charizard Pikachu (39:36 - 39:42)
Mewtwo that would give you six gold (39:38 - 39:45)
tickets by throwing that away six (39:42 - 39:48)
special they&#39;re called special tickets (39:45 - 39:50)
or something (39:48 - 39:53)
yeah I think it&#39;s six because the gold (39:50 - 39:56)
card is a lot more than that the gold (39:53 - 39:58)
card is significantly more rare than (39:56 - 40:00)
immersive though (39:58 - 40:02)
okay (40:00 - 40:06)
um 12 it gets you 12 it gets you 12 okay (40:02 - 40:10)
yeah and the gold card gets you uh 64 64 (40:06 - 40:12)
yep the entire thing you need for that (40:10 - 40:15)
whole collection you would have to (40:12 - 40:17)
pull you couldn&#39;t even pull one (40:15 - 40:19)
immersive Mewtwo and crush it the game (40:17 - 40:20)
doesn&#39;t let you do that you would have (40:19 - 40:23)
to pull three immersive mewt and then (40:20 - 40:25)
throw away one of your immersive mewt to (40:23 - 40:31)
then buy one item in the whale shop yep (40:25 - 40:33)
so the likelihood of you pulling like (40:31 - 40:36)
three gold (40:33 - 40:38)
meww and then being I think that (40:36 - 40:40)
crushing a gold card is the best way to (40:38 - 40:42)
get these items though oh I think so too (40:40 - 40:44)
but I also think if you had a gold card (40:42 - 40:46)
and trading was available you could (40:44 - 40:49)
trade that for anything you want but (40:46 - 40:50)
those are really good (40:49 - 40:52)
items (40:50 - 40:55)
so the fancy sets really nice talk we&#39;re (40:52 - 40:58)
going to be up to $13 million SES next (40:55 - 41:00)
week when Hannah puts a million dollars (40:58 - 41:05)
in to crush mewt for a playmat so so the (41:00 - 41:07)
point here is you can craft the you can (41:05 - 41:11)
use pack points to obtain a card right (41:07 - 41:15)
so you can you can hold up to 2500 pack (41:11 - 41:18)
points at one time yes and a gold card (41:15 - 41:21)
cost 2500 pack points yep so and I (41:18 - 41:24)
believe when you open a pack you get (41:21 - 41:28)
five pack points yep okay yeah so if you (41:24 - 41:30)
open a pack you get five pack points so (41:28 - 41:32)
to get one gold card if you don&#39;t pull (41:30 - 41:36)
it you&#39;d have to get 2500 pack points (41:32 - 41:40)
now you need to have three gold cards in (41:36 - 41:43)
order to turn one into those (41:40 - 41:48)
special event credits so you&#39;d need 7500 (41:43 - 41:50)
pack points to then Crush one of those (41:48 - 41:52)
gold cards and turn it into this whole (41:50 - 41:54)
special set (41:52 - 41:57)
yeah have enough pack points that&#39;s the (41:54 - 42:00)
point I I wouldn&#39;t even like as I agree (41:57 - 42:03)
with Hannah of those the whale items (42:00 - 42:06)
being cool they look great they look (42:03 - 42:09)
fantastic I would never in a even if I (42:06 - 42:11)
had that I would never equip them I (42:09 - 42:13)
would never want to go against another (42:11 - 42:17)
player and they know that I have that (42:13 - 42:18)
like (42:17 - 42:20)
playmat because they&#39;re if I got it (42:18 - 42:24)
based on luck I absolutely would if I (42:20 - 42:27)
got it based on buying a th000 player (42:24 - 42:29)
will never know that they&#39;ll just be (42:27 - 42:32)
like they&#39;re they&#39;re a they&#39;re a whale (42:29 - 42:33)
cuz I&#39;ve already played against whale (42:32 - 42:37)
players Steve&#39;s not a Rolex wearing guy (42:33 - 42:41)
or a or a Mercedes driving person not (42:37 - 42:44)
for the flashiness when I play you don&#39;t (42:41 - 42:47)
usually get a Mercedes based on luck (42:44 - 42:50)
except for luck of your um you&#39;d be (42:47 - 42:51)
surprised how many people have money (42:50 - 42:53)
based on some (42:51 - 42:56)
luck when I would play Clash Royale it (42:53 - 42:58)
was always very very (42:56 - 43:03)
obvious of the whale player right MH and (42:58 - 43:05)
I think with pocket if you have these (43:03 - 43:07)
items especially this early on in the (43:05 - 43:10)
game it&#39;s going to be very obvious that (43:07 - 43:12)
you probably put some money in or you (43:10 - 43:14)
like Hannah said you open four packs and (43:12 - 43:16)
you pulled three immersive mewt in four (43:14 - 43:17)
packs and you&#39;ve never spent a dime in (43:16 - 43:19)
the game I don&#39;t think that&#39;s that (43:17 - 43:21)
scenario I guess statistically it could (43:19 - 43:23)
happen I&#39;m aiming for it I&#39;m really (43:21 - 43:26)
going for it (43:23 - 43:30)
um but when I would play A Clash Royale (43:26 - 43:32)
player and I feel like some people will (43:30 - 43:34)
agree with me and you see the obvious (43:32 - 43:37)
whale player across from you who has the (43:34 - 43:38)
advantage because they they put the (43:37 - 43:41)
money in their units are higher level I (43:38 - 43:44)
would like sit up straight get to the (43:41 - 43:48)
edge of my seat and I&#39;m hyperfocused to (43:44 - 43:50)
win this game because nothing is more (43:48 - 43:53)
satisfying in this world is to defeat (43:50 - 43:56)
the whale player p b purely based off (43:53 - 43:58)
skill level (43:56 - 44:01)
which most of the time they don&#39;t have (43:58 - 44:03)
that&#39;s why they have to whale to like (44:01 - 44:06)
make up for their skill and that was (44:03 - 44:09)
more satisfying than like pulling a gold (44:06 - 44:11)
meww X was like (44:09 - 44:13)
crushing them in a (44:11 - 44:16)
battle well so like I don&#39;t want to like (44:13 - 44:19)
roll up in like a casual Apex emblem (44:16 - 44:22)
event and like flip over my whale (44:19 - 44:25)
playmat even if I got it by luck because (44:22 - 44:28)
I know the other player is like edge of (44:25 - 44:30)
their seat being like I&#39;m gonna make (44:28 - 44:34)
sure I beat this guy who who is out (44:30 - 44:37)
there and maybe we&#39;ll get comments who (44:34 - 44:40)
is out there that is spending a ton of (44:37 - 44:44)
money on this game but then battling and (44:40 - 44:47)
playing terribly like that a lot of (44:44 - 44:49)
people what do you mean no like if I&#39;m (44:47 - 44:51)
unless they&#39;re having fun losing but if (44:49 - 44:55)
I&#39;m losing and not having a good time (44:51 - 44:57)
I&#39;m not going to keep putting money into (44:55 - 44:59)
the game to continue (44:57 - 45:02)
losing yeah but the people who want to (44:59 - 45:03)
collect everything and the people who (45:02 - 45:06)
want to win everything are different (45:03 - 45:08)
people sometimes they want the entire (45:06 - 45:10)
collection and they&#39;re and they&#39;re a (45:08 - 45:12)
whale because they&#39;re they they&#39;re (45:10 - 45:13)
trying to get the entire collection (45:12 - 45:15)
including the emblems which means doing (45:13 - 45:17)
the (45:15 - 45:20)
battles yeah I mean like then they&#39;re (45:17 - 45:23)
just running out Kuno misy (45:20 - 45:26)
yeah finally I wanted another 30 minute (45:23 - 45:28)
conversation (45:26 - 45:32)
Articuno this what I woke up for (45:28 - 45:36)
um there are different types of whales (45:32 - 45:37)
right (45:36 - 45:40)
like Apex (45:37 - 45:43)
Legends I have met people in real life (45:40 - 45:45)
and I can&#39;t believe I met them where (45:43 - 45:47)
they were like I have bought every skin (45:45 - 45:48)
for every (45:47 - 45:51)
character and it would (45:48 - 45:54)
be it would just like you can be very (45:51 - 45:55)
good at a video game but like those (45:54 - 45:57)
characters are so different it would be (45:55 - 46:00)
like really hard for you to be good at (45:57 - 46:02)
every like there&#39;s like 20 some Legends (46:00 - 46:06)
in Apex Legends so like when I and Apex (46:02 - 46:09)
Legends is a freet toplay game but like (46:06 - 46:12)
I bought maybe I probably put like $300 (46:09 - 46:15)
into Apex Legends over five years which (46:12 - 46:17)
when you think about it&#39;s not that bad (46:15 - 46:20)
but there was a point that I was like I (46:17 - 46:23)
can&#39;t I can&#39;t why would I ever pay $20 (46:20 - 46:25)
for a skin for a character I&#39;m never (46:23 - 46:27)
going to play I don&#39;t like playing I&#39;m (46:25 - 46:28)
not good at at playing them I would (46:27 - 46:30)
rather play this character it&#39;s way more (46:28 - 46:31)
fun (46:30 - 46:34)
so there is the whale that would be like (46:31 - 46:37)
I just want to collect everything (46:34 - 46:39)
MH (46:37 - 46:44)
but the game of Apex is naturally (46:39 - 46:48)
competitive like sure yes like and it&#39;s (46:44 - 46:50)
kind of the same for pocket like you (46:48 - 46:52)
could collect (46:50 - 46:55)
everything and that&#39;s and there might be (46:52 - 46:57)
some people that do but getting the (46:55 - 47:00)
playmat G getting the decks the the (46:57 - 47:02)
sleeves getting the coin you have to (47:00 - 47:04)
take that into a (47:02 - 47:07)
competitive nature if you want (47:04 - 47:08)
everything because I&#39;m assuming if you (47:07 - 47:09)
want all the cards and you want (47:08 - 47:11)
everything you probably also want the (47:09 - 47:14)
emblems like you could just stick to the (47:11 - 47:18)
Lapras event but now you&#39;re not getting (47:14 - 47:19)
everything because you&#39;re not you&#39;re (47:18 - 47:21)
missing out on the emblems and even if (47:19 - 47:23)
you don&#39;t care about the emblems you (47:21 - 47:25)
probably want all the shine (47:23 - 47:30)
dust as well well I don&#39;t know I I don&#39;t (47:25 - 47:34)
know uh none of us are whales not with (47:30 - 47:35)
that (47:34 - 47:37)
attitude not yet at Le you don&#39;t know (47:35 - 47:39)
how much I&#39;m wailing in Pokemon sleep (47:37 - 47:41)
I&#39;ve met people I&#39;ve met people in (47:39 - 47:45)
Pokemon sleep that were (47:41 - 47:47)
upset I had to sit at a dinner table (47:45 - 47:50)
with this person for two hours and that (47:47 - 47:52)
was that it was it was it was upsetting (47:50 - 47:54)
to hear them be upset that they couldn&#39;t (47:52 - 47:57)
give Pokemon sleep more money they were (47:54 - 47:59)
mad that they could not accelerate the (47:57 - 48:02)
game (47:59 - 48:02)
anymore I feel like we&#39;ve all had a (48:03 - 48:06)
conversation where we want to give (48:05 - 48:08)
something money and then for some reason (48:06 - 48:10)
we can&#39;t and we&#39;re like I want to give (48:08 - 48:13)
you money we&#39;ve definitely been confused (48:10 - 48:14)
about how how they do it in Pokemon (48:13 - 48:17)
sleep because they do block it more than (48:14 - 48:20)
makes sense sometimes yeah like the (48:17 - 48:22)
Ultra Ball stuff you can only buy three (48:20 - 48:24)
Ultra Balls in Pokemon sleep and then it (48:22 - 48:25)
doesn&#39;t let you buy anymore which is (48:24 - 48:27)
weird one Ultra Balls are probably one (48:25 - 48:29)
of the most overpriced item in any (48:27 - 48:32)
mobile game it&#39;s crazy how expensive (48:29 - 48:35)
they are yeah and you&#39;re only allowed to (48:32 - 48:36)
buy (48:35 - 48:40)
three and there&#39;s still a luck factor to (48:36 - 48:43)
that yeah of like you&#39;re kind of wasting (48:40 - 48:46)
your money even more if the Pokemon (48:43 - 48:49)
isn&#39;t (48:46 - 48:49)
hungry yep and this is this is the other (48:49 - 48:54)
reason why poke why people may feel kind (48:52 - 48:57)
of weirdly this way about Pokemon sleep (48:54 - 48:59)
because the pace of it you have to wait (48:57 - 49:01)
for the perfect opportunity the pace of (48:59 - 49:03)
the game is really slow we were kind of (49:01 - 49:05)
talking about this when Al was on a few (49:03 - 49:09)
weeks ago Pokemon sleep is a much slower (49:05 - 49:14)
kind of take it as you go uh consistent (49:09 - 49:19)
game MH than Pokemon go or TCG pocket or (49:14 - 49:22)
any other Pokemon game I can think of I (49:19 - 49:24)
think we were also talking before about (49:22 - 49:26)
how it&#39;s much more Animal Crossing like (49:24 - 49:28)
MH (49:26 - 49:31)
and so I feel like being kind of upset (49:28 - 49:34)
about the about how slow it feels and (49:31 - 49:36)
not being able to spend money to make it (49:34 - 49:38)
go faster kind of makes sense just (49:36 - 49:40)
because it is a slow game I&#39;m not going (49:38 - 49:41)
to be that (49:40 - 49:44)
person but sometimes I&#39;m annoyed at how (49:41 - 49:47)
slow a game it it can (49:44 - 49:50)
be yeah I (49:47 - 49:53)
agreed which is why pocket is perfect (49:50 - 49:54)
because when I&#39;m annoyed at how slow (49:53 - 49:57)
sleep is I open pocket and no longer (49:54 - 50:01)
annoyed yeah I really want to love po or (49:57 - 50:03)
Pokemon sleep I really really do the (50:01 - 50:05)
development team has been so good to us (50:03 - 50:08)
but yeah it&#39;s a slow game I I mean don&#39;t (50:05 - 50:10)
get me wrong I do love Pokemon sleep (50:08 - 50:13)
it&#39;s just that you you play the game (50:10 - 50:15)
differently right like it&#39;s just it&#39;s (50:13 - 50:19)
just a different way to play a game (50:15 - 50:23)
and there are aspects to that game (50:19 - 50:26)
where it&#39;s more but the thing is it&#39;s (50:23 - 50:28)
more it&#39;s more a me thing than it is a (50:26 - 50:29)
Pokemon sleep thing if I&#39;m mad that I (50:28 - 50:33)
missed giving Snorlax lunch I need to (50:29 - 50:34)
think about like do I need to be mad (50:33 - 50:36)
about that that&#39;s a that&#39;s a me thing (50:34 - 50:40)
right that is a Pokemon sleep thing uh (50:36 - 50:42)
the game for what it is it just like you (50:40 - 50:44)
said it&#39;s just a slower game it&#39;s just a (50:42 - 50:47)
different pace and I think as people who (50:44 - 50:49)
play a lot of different Pokemon games (50:47 - 50:51)
that that&#39;s new to people who play (50:49 - 50:52)
Pokemon games because there haven&#39;t been (50:51 - 50:55)
Pokemon games that are like that I guess (50:52 - 50:58)
you could say like poke Pago in like (50:55 - 51:02)
Ultra Sun Ultra moon was a slower Pace (50:58 - 51:04)
but it was just a part of that game (51:02 - 51:06)
right so exactly when you were done with (51:04 - 51:08)
that slow pace of that you could go back (51:06 - 51:11)
to the main part of the game and play (51:08 - 51:13)
that but I mean I still think they (51:11 - 51:15)
should have a poke palago like mobile (51:13 - 51:17)
game like sleep is almost there but like (51:15 - 51:19)
I feel like they could like it just (51:17 - 51:21)
needs to be integrated bring me back to (51:19 - 51:24)
alola is all I&#39;m saying Pokemon company (51:21 - 51:26)
I think going going back to the the the (51:24 - 51:28)
whale items that are that exist the (51:26 - 51:31)
playmat and the card sleeves I do think (51:28 - 51:36)
in like a year that would be (51:31 - 51:37)
less (51:36 - 51:40)
obvious because people would have time (51:37 - 51:44)
to naturally get those items by just (51:40 - 51:48)
playing or I think reasonably like it&#39;s (51:44 - 51:50)
pretty unreasonable to expect a person (51:48 - 51:52)
to get three of the same gold card in a (51:50 - 51:56)
single week but in a year it&#39;d be like (51:52 - 51:59)
oh yeah that makes sense it&#39;s especially (51:56 - 51:59)
if we don&#39;t get a new set but I think (51:59 - 52:03)
the new (52:02 - 52:06)
sets limit that even more right like if (52:03 - 52:08)
you got two gold mewt you&#39;re not allowed (52:06 - 52:09)
to crush any until you get a third and (52:08 - 52:11)
now that set is completely gone it&#39;s (52:09 - 52:15)
rotated out so now you have to try again (52:11 - 52:17)
on the new set to get three gold ones (52:15 - 52:19)
ass assuming sets are every like three (52:17 - 52:21)
months I don&#39;t think they&#39;re going to (52:19 - 52:23)
rotate sets out that often though I was (52:21 - 52:25)
just having this conversation the other (52:23 - 52:28)
day like if you go and look at the (52:25 - 52:29)
uh when you go to when you go to open a (52:28 - 52:31)
pack you can click like open a different (52:29 - 52:33)
kind of pack but right now there&#39;s only (52:31 - 52:36)
genetic Apex so when you open that (52:33 - 52:40)
screen there&#39;s a it&#39;s a giant screen and (52:36 - 52:44)
the genetic Apex logo is very very small (52:40 - 52:47)
and there is a lot of empty space which (52:44 - 52:49)
leads me to believe that there will be a (52:47 - 52:52)
decent amount of sets like that could (52:49 - 52:54)
come about if this game does continue to (52:52 - 52:55)
stay popular and they do want to (52:54 - 52:58)
continue doing that where you&#39;re able to (52:55 - 53:01)
go back and open cards from older sets (52:58 - 53:02)
like if you just look at the screen it&#39;s (53:01 - 53:04)
like I don&#39;t feel like they&#39;d have that (53:02 - 53:06)
much empty space on the screen to fill (53:04 - 53:08)
it with logos of different sets and then (53:06 - 53:12)
remove older sets like you don&#39;t think (53:08 - 53:13)
hold on hold this (53:12 - 53:16)
thought let&#39;s take a (53:13 - 53:18)
break because this is going to spark (53:16 - 53:20)
another 20 minute (53:18 - 53:22)
[Laughter] (53:20 - 53:24)
conversation yeah let&#39;s talk let&#39;s let&#39;s (53:22 - 53:26)
save that for after the break we&#39;ll talk (53:24 - 53:29)
about Poss POS future sets uh so we will (53:26 - 53:35)
be right back and we are back okay the (53:29 - 53:40)
the the future set thing Bobby saying (53:35 - 53:42)
they have room for more (53:40 - 53:46)
sets you don&#39;t think they&#39;re going to (53:42 - 53:49)
pull genetic Apex I almost said generic (53:46 - 53:51)
Apex that&#39;s what I&#39;ve been calling it uh (53:49 - 53:52)
you don&#39;t think they&#39;re going to pull (53:51 - 53:55)
genetic Apex to increase the Rarity of (53:52 - 53:59)
that stuff to then push trading no I (53:55 - 54:02)
think that the more expansions coming (53:59 - 54:06)
out will in itself create (54:02 - 54:10)
a its own Rarity in a way because there (54:06 - 54:13)
will be so many more options and people (54:10 - 54:15)
unless you&#39;re a whale or not even just a (54:13 - 54:16)
whale but unless you&#39;re spending more (54:15 - 54:18)
money like you only have two free packs (54:16 - 54:20)
a day maybe three if you&#39;re on premium (54:18 - 54:25)
right and the the addition of it of more (54:20 - 54:27)
sets is going to create it own type of (54:25 - 54:31)
Rarity for those older sets um or (54:27 - 54:32)
because like either someone&#39;s going to (54:31 - 54:34)
continue opening the older set but then (54:32 - 54:35)
they&#39;re not going to have any of the new (54:34 - 54:36)
stuff and they&#39;re going to want to trade (54:35 - 54:39)
for that potentially or they&#39;re going to (54:36 - 54:41)
start opening newer sets which is what (54:39 - 54:44)
you see in real life yeah but also in (54:41 - 54:45)
real (54:44 - 54:49)
life it&#39;s hard to find certain sets So (54:45 - 54:51)
eventually yeah eventually I&#39;m not (54:49 - 54:53)
saying that like they&#39;re never going to (54:51 - 54:55)
remove sets or there but I just don&#39;t (54:53 - 54:57)
think that it&#39;s going to be like even in (54:55 - 54:59)
a year let&#39;s say another four sets come (54:57 - 55:01)
out over the next let&#39;s just say that&#39;s (54:59 - 55:02)
what happens over the next year let&#39;s (55:01 - 55:05)
say what&#39; you say I said we can only (55:02 - 55:08)
hope yeah um let&#39;s say another four sets (55:05 - 55:11)
come out four or five sets I don&#39;t think (55:08 - 55:14)
that they would remove genetic Apex in (55:11 - 55:16)
that time frame (55:14 - 55:19)
and just because literally like the more (55:16 - 55:21)
sets you put out there it will create (55:19 - 55:23)
its own natural Rarity because people (55:21 - 55:25)
will not open the older set nearly as (55:23 - 55:27)
much because the newer stuff will (55:25 - 55:29)
either have cards that are going to be (55:27 - 55:30)
more playable in that moment and so (55:29 - 55:32)
opening an older set&#39;s not going to do a (55:30 - 55:34)
whole lot because the newer stuff is (55:32 - 55:38)
going to be better for com competition (55:34 - 55:40)
or there&#39;s just going to add things to (55:38 - 55:43)
it that maybe make the newer sets seem (55:40 - 55:47)
more fun or something will happen where (55:43 - 55:50)
the older sets will just not get opened (55:47 - 55:52)
as (55:50 - 55:54)
often yeah I just I guess I was thinking (55:52 - 55:59)
in the sense of like a zzz or a Pokemon (55:54 - 56:02)
Masters where like these Banners are (55:59 - 56:05)
gone and if you don&#39;t (56:02 - 56:08)
pull on this to get the things in this (56:05 - 56:10)
Banner you have to wait till this Banner (56:08 - 56:12)
returns but I don&#39;t think they&#39;re going (56:10 - 56:13)
to bring I don&#39;t think they&#39;re going to (56:12 - 56:15)
cycle them I don&#39;t think they would (56:13 - 56:16)
cycle them like that they would cycle (56:15 - 56:19)
sets like that like I don&#39;t think we&#39;re (56:16 - 56:21)
going to get through four or five sets (56:19 - 56:23)
they remove genetic Apex and bring it (56:21 - 56:25)
back like a year later I don&#39;t think it (56:23 - 56:27)
would work it would happen in that same (56:25 - 56:29)
way because you wouldn&#39;t I guess you&#39;re (56:27 - 56:32)
bringing it to new people but all these (56:29 - 56:33)
people who are buying these cards and (56:32 - 56:35)
getting these Collections and the whole (56:33 - 56:37)
point is to collect all the cards (56:35 - 56:38)
probably aren&#39;t going to you&#39;re not (56:37 - 56:40)
going to have a big hit of coming back (56:38 - 56:44)
to those later when you when you return (56:40 - 56:46)
for a for something like a set of cards (56:44 - 56:49)
unless you want to crush three (56:46 - 56:49)
meww like I (56:50 - 56:55)
definitely I think there I think there&#39;s (56:53 - 56:59)
a value in the maybe I I could be wrong (56:55 - 57:02)
um and it&#39;s probably not perceived (56:59 - 57:04)
correctly because everyone is playing (57:02 - 57:07)
right now but I would imagine if (57:04 - 57:10)
somebody just starts playing in (57:07 - 57:13)
December they have no opportunity to get (57:10 - 57:14)
that Mankey (57:13 - 57:17)
promo so they have to trade for (57:14 - 57:23)
it um so it does feel like they at least (57:17 - 57:25)
right now and maybe when this podcast (57:23 - 57:28)
comes up because we&#39;re recording early (57:25 - 57:30)
none of this will matter but it does (57:28 - 57:33)
feel like right now the promos are (57:30 - 57:35)
something you want to stock up on yeah (57:33 - 57:37)
because they are going to go away and (57:35 - 57:39)
then that would be good for (57:37 - 57:43)
trading but I I do think that maybe in (57:39 - 57:45)
six months or a year there will be a set (57:43 - 57:49)
like a prismatic Eevee with which has a (57:45 - 57:51)
time limit on it and maybe it&#39;s not as (57:49 - 57:53)
big as genetic (57:51 - 57:56)
Apex but I I I can&#39;t imagine this game&#39;s (57:53 - 57:58)
life cycle is just going to be we keep (57:56 - 58:01)
adding sets and we don&#39;t pull (57:58 - 58:06)
any you in TCG live or not maybe not in (58:01 - 58:09)
live but when TCG online was a thing you (58:06 - 58:12)
could buy we were deep into the sword (58:09 - 58:15)
and shield era and you could buy Sun not (58:12 - 58:17)
buy but you could use like the the the (58:15 - 58:19)
credits that you get for logging in the (58:17 - 58:22)
coins to buy sun and moon (58:19 - 58:25)
sets yeah in that time frame right like (58:22 - 58:28)
there&#39;s I you you you can get Black and (58:25 - 58:30)
White sets yeah those those those came (58:28 - 58:34)
back on like a limited (58:30 - 58:34)
rotation black and white oh they came (58:34 - 58:37)
back on a limited rotation yeah because (58:36 - 58:39)
there were there there was still a leg (58:37 - 58:40)
there was still I don&#39;t know what they (58:39 - 58:41)
call it Legacy format I think that&#39;s (58:40 - 58:42)
what magic calls it there was still a (58:41 - 58:44)
legacy format and people would freak out (58:42 - 58:48)
if like boundaries cross came back I (58:44 - 58:49)
think it was boundaries cross I don&#39;t (58:48 - 58:54)
remember but like I I (58:49 - 58:57)
had dozens of black white unopened (58:54 - 59:00)
booster packs and because you couldn&#39;t (58:57 - 59:02)
go into the store to actively buy them (59:00 - 59:04)
with your coins which was like a fake (59:02 - 59:06)
currency anyways you couldn&#39;t buy coins (59:04 - 59:07)
you could only earn coins from like (59:06 - 59:10)
logging in or whatever uh I could trade (59:07 - 59:13)
for like almost anything I wanted (59:10 - 59:14)
because (59:13 - 59:16)
those you could go back to Sun and Moon (59:14 - 59:19)
I think you could go back as far as (59:16 - 59:22)
standard was so there&#39;s like a couple (59:19 - 59:24)
questions here it&#39;s like are they going (59:22 - 59:26)
to rotate right are they going to have (59:24 - 59:29)
special sets that like hey only this (59:26 - 59:30)
month this set will be available and (59:29 - 59:32)
we&#39;re pulling it and maybe it&#39;ll come (59:30 - 59:34)
back in the future which is a very very (59:32 - 59:35)
Pokemon thing that&#39;s like not exclusive (59:34 - 59:37)
to pocket or other gacha games it&#39;s just (59:35 - 59:40)
a Pokemon thing that they like to do and (59:37 - 59:41)
is the (59:40 - 59:43)
non-competitive but this game will (59:41 - 59:46)
definitely be competitive future going (59:43 - 59:47)
to have a set (59:46 - 59:49)
rotation and if there&#39;s a set rotation (59:47 - 59:53)
what is that due to genetic Apex because (59:49 - 59:54)
that would ideally be the first thing (59:53 - 59:57)
that rotates yeah I guess guess I guess (59:54 - 59:59)
my thought is that I don&#39;t I&#39;m not (59:57 - 60:02)
saying that they would like let&#39;s say (59:59 - 60:03)
let&#39;s say this game is incredibly (60:02 - 60:05)
successful and six years seven years (60:03 - 60:08)
down the line we have 32 sets of cards I (60:05 - 60:10)
don&#39;t think they would have all 32 (60:08 - 60:13)
available to like pull from at that time (60:10 - 60:15)
like I do think that things could go (60:13 - 60:17)
away they could come back but I don&#39;t (60:15 - 60:18)
think they&#39;d come back in a way that (60:17 - 60:19)
would be (60:18 - 60:23)
like what&#39;s trying to bring people back (60:19 - 60:24)
into it like I don&#39;t think they&#39;d be (60:23 - 60:26)
like you missed genetic Apex the first (60:24 - 60:27)
time and it&#39;s like two years down the (60:26 - 60:30)
line here it is again genetic Apex Bas (60:27 - 60:33)
set to bring it back they put a little (60:30 - 60:37)
two on it yeah I I don&#39;t think that (60:33 - 60:39)
would happen like they might make things (60:37 - 60:41)
go away at some point in the future (60:39 - 60:43)
maybe they bring them back just because (60:41 - 60:45)
they can but for now like what we&#39;re (60:43 - 60:47)
talking about how this all started was (60:45 - 60:50)
like over the next year that you know (60:47 - 60:52)
getting that special set would be easier (60:50 - 60:54)
because like genetic Apex will be around (60:52 - 60:56)
unless it&#39;s not I don&#39;t think it&#39;s not (60:54 - 60:57)
going to around in a year I think (60:56 - 61:00)
they&#39;re going to keep that set there and (60:57 - 61:02)
then as new sets come out they&#39;re just (61:00 - 61:04)
going to keep them there for a while now (61:02 - 61:06)
I don&#39;t know what a while is because I (61:04 - 61:07)
don&#39;t even think they know what a while (61:06 - 61:09)
is at this point in time right like yeah (61:07 - 61:11)
no yeah I don&#39;t so but I don&#39;t think the (61:09 - 61:14)
sets are going anywhere anytime soon for (61:11 - 61:16)
sure and I know the question had come up (61:14 - 61:18)
earlier this week in like a slack (61:16 - 61:20)
conversation or something about like the (61:18 - 61:22)
pack points because the pack points are (61:20 - 61:25)
only set specific so like all the pack (61:22 - 61:27)
points that we have that are four (61:25 - 61:30)
genetic Apex interesting that&#39;s my (61:27 - 61:32)
understanding of it and um they&#39;re set (61:30 - 61:34)
specific so people are like I want to (61:32 - 61:36)
save the pack points but I don&#39;t want (61:34 - 61:38)
genetic Apex to go away and then I&#39;ve (61:36 - 61:40)
wasted not done anything with those pack (61:38 - 61:44)
points and yeah the idea is like for one (61:40 - 61:45)
I think they would definitely tell us if (61:44 - 61:46)
a set&#39;s going to go away I don&#39;t think (61:45 - 61:47)
we would wake up one morning and the (61:46 - 61:50)
set&#39;s just gone but I really don&#39;t think (61:47 - 61:51)
that they&#39;re going to go (61:50 - 61:54)
anywhere anytime soon I think they&#39;re (61:51 - 61:57)
going to be around and again (61:54 - 61:59)
it actually says in the about in the (61:57 - 62:01)
about pack points it says if the (61:59 - 62:03)
availability period for a given booster (62:01 - 62:05)
pack ends its pack points will no longer (62:03 - 62:07)
be available for exchange yeah so I (62:05 - 62:09)
think they have to put that in there (62:07 - 62:10)
because that&#39;s like potentially going to (62:09 - 62:12)
happen at some point but I really do (62:10 - 62:14)
think the addition of different sets is (62:12 - 62:16)
going to create almost a natural Rarity (62:14 - 62:18)
for some of the cards that are older (62:16 - 62:20)
because people will want to focus on the (62:18 - 62:23)
new sets as they come out because oh (62:20 - 62:25)
they&#39;re new they&#39;re fun they&#39;re shiny (62:23 - 62:27)
right like and yeah then they will not (62:25 - 62:30)
be using their two free packs to get (62:27 - 62:32)
genetic Apex when they could have (62:30 - 62:35)
Prismatic Evolution something in you (62:32 - 62:38)
know six months either of you two used (62:35 - 62:40)
your pack points for (62:38 - 62:43)
anything yes you&#39;re gonna hate (62:40 - 62:47)
me did you use it for a Marowak (62:43 - 62:52)
uhuh Articuno Misty (62:47 - 62:52)
oh I wanted to play I wanted to see what (62:53 - 62:57)
this deck was about I wanted to see what (62:56 - 62:59)
was going you do the you didn&#39;t do like (62:57 - 63:01)
the full art Misty no no no no that&#39;s I (62:59 - 63:02)
don&#39;t (63:01 - 63:06)
even just the did trainer uh I&#39;ve (63:02 - 63:08)
primarily opened on (63:06 - 63:11)
Mewtwo um yeah because Mew because (63:08 - 63:12)
Mewtwo has Mewtwo and has Venusaur has a (63:11 - 63:15)
couple other cards yep uh but I never (63:12 - 63:19)
got gavor so I I I I pack pointed for (63:15 - 63:21)
two gavor because I had literally (63:19 - 63:23)
everything for the deck except gavor (63:21 - 63:25)
yeah and like M I guess Mewtwo would be (63:23 - 63:27)
technically harder to get then (63:25 - 63:31)
gapore like statistically yes (63:27 - 63:35)
yeah for EX card it was 15 for (63:31 - 63:37)
gavor 70 (63:35 - 63:42)
per right 150 per gavor it is yeah oh (63:37 - 63:45)
yeah wow how what did you pack Point (63:42 - 63:49)
Hannah really silly small things just to (63:45 - 63:51)
like fill out your deck or just things (63:49 - 63:52)
yeah to fill out my deck cards that I (63:51 - 63:54)
wanted like my very first Pokemon card (63:52 - 63:56)
was a horsey card so I wanted some of (63:54 - 64:00)
those I um have been getting the metal (63:56 - 64:02)
that&#39;s what it&#39;s called in this game (64:00 - 64:05)
right metal type um to fill out the (64:02 - 64:08)
missions for the premium while I have (64:05 - 64:12)
the onee free premium all of that oh so (64:08 - 64:15)
pack points work towards missions yeah (64:12 - 64:17)
like because you got the card yeah so (64:15 - 64:20)
really silly small things (64:17 - 64:23)
okay I that&#39;s what they&#39;re there for I (64:20 - 64:25)
can&#39;t believe we&#39;ve like spent three (64:23 - 64:26)
hours talking about pocket in the last (64:25 - 64:28)
like three weeks and we didn&#39;t bring up (64:26 - 64:32)
the bent card Theory oh no oh cuz that (64:28 - 64:34)
was like a theory for a minute but I (64:32 - 64:36)
people still think it I just want I want (64:34 - 64:38)
to talk about it real quick all right (64:36 - 64:43)
so so when I sat with the developers in (64:38 - 64:46)
New York one of the questions said is (64:43 - 64:49)
there any sort of pity system at all (64:46 - 64:51)
like does the game realize that you&#39;ve (64:49 - 64:55)
pulled 199 cards out of 200 cards and (64:51 - 64:56)
it&#39;s going to like boost the last card (64:55 - 64:58)
or is it going to give you and they (64:56 - 65:02)
strictly said no they&#39;re like the rates (64:58 - 65:05)
that you open are 100% accurate there is (65:02 - 65:09)
no pity the rates do not change at all (65:05 - 65:13)
and from a legal standpoint they need to (65:09 - 65:16)
exist because of European laws that it&#39;s (65:13 - 65:17)
not actually American laws or Japanese (65:16 - 65:21)
laws it&#39;s the European laws exist for (65:17 - 65:23)
those rates so when you go to open up (65:21 - 65:26)
genetic Apex Mewtwo you can see your (65:23 - 65:29)
exact chance for Mewtwo your exact (65:26 - 65:31)
chance for Sabrina your exact chance for (65:29 - 65:34)
Venusaur EX you can see all those rates (65:31 - 65:37)
that huge Carousel of cards where (65:34 - 65:39)
sometimes one is randomly backwards (65:37 - 65:42)
sometimes one is like slightly bent it&#39;s (65:39 - 65:44)
a it&#39;s a complete (65:42 - 65:47)
illusion like those car those packs (65:44 - 65:49)
don&#39;t have different rates because if (65:47 - 65:51)
they did they would have to be disclosed (65:49 - 65:54)
yeah now some people were like well (65:51 - 65:56)
there&#39;s a message that says like (65:54 - 65:58)
the packs are different depending (65:56 - 66:01)
because when you hit the little info all (65:58 - 66:03)
that message is saying is that there&#39;s a (66:01 - 66:06)
one in 2,000 chance for a God pack and (66:03 - 66:08)
then everything else is just a regular (66:06 - 66:10)
pack that has regular odds I think it&#39;s (66:08 - 66:13)
like (66:10 - 66:13)
0.005% which I think is one in 2000 uh (66:13 - 66:18)
Hannah would know she got multiple God (66:16 - 66:22)
packs I got one One Singular and that&#39;s (66:18 - 66:24)
the most exciting pack I&#39;ve had it was (66:22 - 66:26)
just so good with two artic ex ex is (66:24 - 66:27)
actually I&#39;m surprised Hannah&#39;s not (66:26 - 66:30)
playing misy yeah I haven&#39;t gotten a (66:27 - 66:32)
single Misty yet maybe by the time this (66:30 - 66:34)
episode&#39;s up (66:32 - 66:38)
so there are God packs the game confirms (66:34 - 66:39)
there are God packs they tell you what (66:38 - 66:42)
the odds of a God pack areh and they (66:39 - 66:44)
tell you the odds of every pack they (66:42 - 66:48)
even tell you the odds of what your odd (66:44 - 66:51)
of getting gold Mewtwo in the fifth slot (66:48 - 66:53)
or getting gold Mewtwo in the fourth (66:51 - 66:55)
slot or getting gold Mewtwo I actually (66:53 - 66:56)
don&#39;t know if you can get in the third (66:55 - 66:57)
SL if you can it would it would it would (66:56 - 67:00)
tell you well the God Pack would I guess (66:57 - 67:03)
technically oh true theack true true (67:00 - 67:06)
so it&#39;s it&#39;s just it&#39;s just an illusion (67:03 - 67:10)
of choice it (67:06 - 67:12)
like unfortunately you just compare it (67:10 - 67:13)
to (67:12 - 67:18)
gambling where MH they put a bunch of (67:13 - 67:22)
machines they all and and while there (67:18 - 67:24)
are different win conditions right like (67:22 - 67:25)
somebody&#39;s played this machine so it&#39;s (67:24 - 67:28)
close closer to the wind condition than (67:25 - 67:30)
the machine sitting next to it uh one (67:28 - 67:32)
there is no wind condition in this it&#39;s (67:30 - 67:35)
just percentages but two there are just (67:32 - 67:38)
people who feel like that machine is (67:35 - 67:40)
their machine so there are there are (67:38 - 67:42)
definitely people that feel like if I (67:40 - 67:46)
see a backwards pack that that is the (67:42 - 67:48)
pack I need to open or if I see a pack (67:46 - 67:51)
that is slightly bent that is the pack I (67:48 - 67:55)
have to open and that&#39;s just that&#39;s a (67:51 - 67:57)
real Pokemon card thing by the way like (67:55 - 67:59)
people go to the store and they&#39;ll be (67:57 - 68:02)
like oh that box is damaged uh I&#39;m going (67:59 - 68:04)
to get that one cuz the damage to box is (68:02 - 68:06)
like the lucky right this is It&#39;s (68:04 - 68:08)
Superstition right it&#39;s Superstition (68:06 - 68:11)
it&#39;s it&#39;s luck it&#39;s that happens all (68:08 - 68:13)
over obviously but that is all it is (68:11 - 68:15)
here in in Pocket as (68:13 - 68:18)
well and it&#39;s really it&#39;s just really (68:15 - 68:22)
smart like yeah it is it is really smart (68:18 - 68:25)
to feed into people&#39;s Superstition (68:22 - 68:27)
because they&#39;re more like because they (68:25 - 68:30)
feel better about it like if they think (68:27 - 68:32)
the pack is more likely to have better (68:30 - 68:34)
cards because it&#39;s bent they&#39;re going to (68:32 - 68:36)
spend more time looking for the bent (68:34 - 68:38)
packs and then when they get validated (68:36 - 68:40)
on that feeling of like I did get (68:38 - 68:42)
something good they&#39;re going to like (68:40 - 68:44)
talk about they&#39;re going to tell other (68:42 - 68:46)
people it it&#39;s literally just gambling (68:44 - 68:48)
culture that&#39;s all it is it&#39;s just like (68:46 - 68:49)
your grandma coming with her stroller (68:48 - 68:52)
being like this is my lucky machine I&#39;ve (68:49 - 68:54)
won here multiple times and it&#39;s like (68:52 - 68:56)
well Grandma loves this machine so I&#39;m (68:54 - 68:59)
going to play at this machine too like I (68:56 - 69:00)
know if he said her (68:59 - 69:03)
stroller walker sorry her (69:00 - 69:05)
walker she could have a stroller you (69:03 - 69:07)
know or can yeah it&#39;s (69:05 - 69:11)
possible uh and if if that&#39;s like I like (69:07 - 69:13)
opening the backwards packs mhm same (69:11 - 69:15)
just cuz I think they&#39;re I think they&#39;re (69:13 - 69:17)
fun but like I don&#39;t it also reminded me (69:15 - 69:19)
that you could turn a pack around which (69:17 - 69:21)
I completely forgotten by the time the (69:19 - 69:24)
game came out yeah that is fun um but (69:21 - 69:27)
like I know that it&#39;s not like (69:24 - 69:30)
statistically better I&#39;m pretty sure my (69:27 - 69:32)
God pack came from a backwards pack and (69:30 - 69:33)
that may have influenced how I feel (69:32 - 69:35)
about them as well you confirmed here (69:33 - 69:37)
the backwards packs are better than the (69:35 - 69:39)
bend (69:37 - 69:41)
packs you heard it here (69:39 - 69:44)
first uh last bit of news it&#39;s not (69:41 - 69:47)
really a bunch of news here um well well (69:44 - 69:49)
one there was like a small dmax event in (69:47 - 69:52)
Yokohama that they just randomly did it (69:49 - 69:54)
was just like Squirtle Bulbasaur it was (69:52 - 69:56)
just the starter Pokemon and they shot a (69:54 - 69:58)
giant laser up into the sky to make it (69:56 - 70:00)
look like a a raid and then they just (69:58 - 70:02)
had like a giant iPhone in front of the (70:00 - 70:04)
giant laser they were shooting up in the (70:02 - 70:06)
sky there was just like a one day event (70:04 - 70:09)
in yoga Hama that they just did (70:06 - 70:12)
randomly I guess all right (70:09 - 70:15)
everything that&#39;s all you need um but (70:12 - 70:19)
the other Pokemon Go News uh is this was (70:15 - 70:22)
in the the recent update that was pushed (70:19 - 70:23)
so I guess you could say this was the (70:22 - 70:25)
data mine I do want to bring this up (70:23 - 70:27)
because one by the time this podcast (70:25 - 70:29)
goes up this would actually probably be (70:27 - 70:30)
proper (70:29 - 70:32)
news (70:30 - 70:35)
also hey I I didn&#39;t I didn&#39;t data mine (70:32 - 70:37)
it it&#39;s it&#39;s all over social media so we (70:35 - 70:40)
report on what what&#39;s there um Niantic (70:37 - 70:43)
is going to be eventually don&#39;t know (70:40 - 70:44)
when this is happening again we&#39;re (70:43 - 70:45)
recording this podcast a couple weeks (70:44 - 70:48)
early they&#39;re adding Max mushrooms to (70:45 - 70:52)
the game which we are one step closer to (70:48 - 70:55)
Max soup (70:52 - 70:58)
we are almost and again it&#39;s going to (70:55 - 71:02)
cost like $10 for Max soup cuz these (70:58 - 71:07)
items So currently what the the game is (71:02 - 71:10)
saying is Max mushrooms were used your (71:07 - 71:12)
attacks are boosted you can try this (71:10 - 71:14)
item for five minutes it will normally (71:12 - 71:17)
last for 30 minutes it will double the (71:14 - 71:22)
attack power of your Pokemon in Max (71:17 - 71:22)
raids yep yeah now in in sword and (71:24 - 71:30)
shield you would collect Max mushrooms (71:27 - 71:31)
and then you would take those Max (71:30 - 71:35)
mushrooms to the cafeteria or the like (71:31 - 71:37)
little kitchen and then you would give (71:35 - 71:39)
them Max mushrooms and then that would (71:37 - 71:42)
be what was used to make Max soup (71:39 - 71:46)
there&#39;s no Max soup here of course um (71:42 - 71:50)
but Max mushrooms are a big part of the (71:46 - 71:54)
gigantamax feature and ideally soup (71:50 - 71:56)
would be the next logical conclusion (71:54 - 72:00)
inclusion uh but it also sounds like if (71:56 - 72:02)
you don&#39;t have 40 (72:00 - 72:04)
people what if some of you paid for (72:02 - 72:07)
these mushrooms to then do more damage (72:04 - 72:10)
to then not need 40 people selling the (72:07 - 72:13)
solution (72:10 - 72:15)
yep I don&#39;t know if like that was like (72:13 - 72:19)
the longterm thing of that (72:15 - 72:22)
but it doesn&#39;t feel (72:19 - 72:25)
great it&#39;s also not officially out yet (72:22 - 72:27)
yeah yeah I think we kind of have to (72:25 - 72:30)
hold those opinions on that until it&#39;s (72:27 - 72:32)
officially out on like it doesn&#39;t feel (72:30 - 72:33)
great (72:32 - 72:36)
but it&#39;s not all out there yet yeah it&#39;s (72:33 - 72:38)
not all out there yet I&#39;m curious if (72:36 - 72:40)
it&#39;ll apply to the entire team or just (72:38 - 72:42)
the one person who&#39;s using it I&#39;m (72:40 - 72:44)
curious if party power stuff will (72:42 - 72:46)
interact with it like being in a party (72:44 - 72:49)
with someone will let you share it I&#39;m (72:46 - 72:51)
also curious if this will also you could (72:49 - 72:54)
use it to boost your attack but also you (72:51 - 72:57)
could use it for Max sup (72:54 - 72:58)
yeah like Stardust you can use it to (72:57 - 73:01)
trade or you can use it to power up (72:58 - 73:03)
right yeah (73:01 - 73:06)
right because like having these items (73:03 - 73:08)
and being able to help people that way (73:06 - 73:12)
could feel so good but also money yeah (73:08 - 73:13)
yeah no I think the money thing is (73:12 - 73:16)
completely valid but but like the money (73:13 - 73:18)
thing isn&#39;t new right you can pay for a (73:16 - 73:22)
lucky egg and you can get more (73:18 - 73:25)
experience so in my head if somebody in (73:22 - 73:26)
a group is willing to pay for Max (73:25 - 73:29)
mushrooms and you&#39;re saying we can (73:26 - 73:33)
get Dynamax landeras I&#39;m assuming (73:29 - 73:35)
legendaries will be able to Dynamax one (73:33 - 73:37)
day if we can get Dynamax landeras done (73:35 - 73:40)
half as fast because somebody&#39;s willing (73:37 - 73:44)
to pay and we can do more landeras in (73:40 - 73:46)
the day which is ultimately more fun (73:44 - 73:48)
which is more shiny checks which is just (73:46 - 73:50)
more landeres in general which I don&#39;t (73:48 - 73:53)
really see that different of I&#39;m just (73:50 - 73:54)
going to buy a lucky egg to get more (73:53 - 73:57)
experience so if it does work in a group (73:54 - 74:01)
setting of like hey me Bobby Hannah and (73:57 - 74:05)
Will are going to grind out landeras in (74:01 - 74:08)
Dynamax raids and we know that we can (74:05 - 74:10)
get it done in three minutes but if I (74:08 - 74:12)
buy Max mushrooms we can get it done in (74:10 - 74:13)
two (74:12 - 74:15)
minutes that kind of seems like a win (74:13 - 74:17)
and it&#39;s not really that different than (74:15 - 74:18)
lucky (74:17 - 74:21)
egg yeah cuz you could you could do one (74:18 - 74:23)
landeras or you (74:21 - 74:25)
could you could do two landeras or you (74:23 - 74:28)
could pop a lucky egg and do one well it (74:25 - 74:30)
would be two to (74:28 - 74:34)
three no lucky egg is double yeah yes (74:30 - 74:37)
yeah Stardust is 1.5 yeah (74:34 - 74:39)
yeah (74:37 - 74:43)
um would I buy (74:39 - 74:46)
this I would probably buy it for like a (74:43 - 74:50)
wild area or for a go Fest yeah for a (74:46 - 74:52)
group setting with friends I I like (74:50 - 74:54)
being able to help people and so I feel (74:52 - 74:57)
like I could see myself doing that yeah (74:54 - 75:00)
yeah but again we don&#39;t know exactly (74:57 - 75:02)
when that&#39;s coming but I think I just (75:00 - 75:03)
wanted to bring it up because I do feel (75:02 - 75:06)
like it is one step closer to soup and I (75:03 - 75:07)
think soup would alleviate a lot of (75:06 - 75:11)
people&#39;s issues with the system yes so (75:07 - 75:13)
agreed one one step closer to soup all (75:11 - 75:17)
right we will be back next week thank (75:13 - 75:19)
you Bobby thank you Hannah I&#39;m sure (75:17 - 75:21)
there&#39;s a bunch of stuff we missed again (75:19 - 75:23)
these were recorded early so if there (75:21 - 75:26)
was any crazy breaking news you have to (75:23 - 75:27)
wait (75:26 - 75:30)
but we could continue talking about (75:27 - 75:31)
pocket I still have so much to say about (75:30 - 75:35)
pocket but you know good good timing on (75:31 - 75:37)
that I suppose uh we&#39;ll see you guys (75:35 - 75:38)
