[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 442nd episode of the pokemon podcast first episode of 2021 i am your host sbj here uh this is a podcast about pokemon uh greg is here it's been what 10 years of podcasting yeah sure and you're like it's a thing that i'm doing i was like new year maybe we do something a little different look if we're going to do something different we have to plan that like something different on the fly never works but it is 20 21 welcome to 2021. well also here back from uh travis west virginia east virginia and thanks for uh doxing me there i don't know i i honestly feel that 2021 is the year of relicanth i'm not saying i'm not saying no i'm saying no look the main argument i have for why 2021 is the year of relicanth because numerous times doing dynamaxx adventures the new craze that all the kids are into this year from last year carryover carryover you constantly over and over don't sleep on relicanth that thing will carry you through to the end of any dynamax adventure it is strong it'll get you where you need to go i'm i'm for it the tertinator crew pointing out that it's grass water and then it should be a fire type this year has won me a little bit with that argument i still like gear of the sock though like socket to it but the problem is is that number one you're mispronouncing it where she washes out the window the problem is number one you're mispronouncing swalk number two when i say sock you get mad sock has a partner sock has throw right miractus didn't have a buddy quillfish didn't have a buddy uh-huh sock's got a buddy well i can't relicanth has no not only i mean tertinator doesn't have a buddy either the terenator is just i i why would you bring up tertinator when you can bring up torquel i mean i'm fine with torque now but also turtles are gross [Laughter] the thing about relicanth is it is so exclusive that they like banished it to new zealand that's like the rarest of the standalone dude what if it's the year of the soul rock and we are like martin where we just we pretend that we're doing something for 2021 but we're really not like 201 is just a big build up for no payoff well that's soul rock in a nutshell isn't it all right we got a show not a lot of pokemon news as i believe niantic and dna and seems like everyone else in the entire world are still not working i'm sure they all come back to work i think well i think a lot of people i've been up for two weeks so but we got some news we'll make it through of course let's start with the easy news uh the raid rotation in sword and shield has happened once again gigantomax snorlax and gigantomax duraladon will be featured in january's max raid battles and i guess big question mark if they're going to do a weekend of something getting promoted because they haven't missed one since july well then i say yes yes they will do a weekend of something being promoted hey maybe 2021 is giving up on sword and shield i don't know for remakes more sword and shield news uh there is a special it's not that special uh there's a special pikachu you can download up to january 15th i think oh i gotta do that oh i gotta do that right now let me i i yeah it is the kaibo pikachu or kibo i think i was saying it wrong i think somebody said it's kibo because the i is the e where's andrew it's kibo yeah kibo there's no code needed you just have to connect to mystery gift and then do the connect via internet and then you have until january 15th it is a cherished ball pikachu it has the special ribbon um and it knows the moves celebrate and wish which are exclusive or obviously pikachu can't learn those moves normally all right bobby pause the podcast right now get your switch and get the pikachu all right ain't gonna happen i said his name yeah i spoke to him on the podcast directly and said do that and it's like i'll get to it and then what happens every time bobby's wife hit pause on the podcast tell bobby to get his switch and get the pikachu friends of bobby stop the podcast all folks in southern california triangulate on bobby tell him to press pause and get the pikachu i'm really glad game freak went to space to announce brand new games and to yeah that announcement was so great it was it was really fantastic i'm so excited that they're remaking galler to fix the trees this time it's the update and new that i've been waiting for 2020. did either of you watch the uh sunrise nope i woke up and then at 10 o'clock was like oh damn that was today i thought about it two hours late i mean it's on youtube it's like a two hour video you can go back and watch it i the pokemon section of it was about like two minutes it wasn't terribly long maybe it was like four minutes but it was the the astronaut they featured on the kibo.space website i can't remember his name i'm sorry um and then the it was like unfortunately it was not a pikachu plush which it would be really great to see a plush floating around in space it was just a like 3d ar rendered pikachu that said pika a couple times and then a rayquaza showed up because as greg and i discussed last week the alga and palkia do not make sense in space while palkia can control space it's not outer space it is the theory of space um well the dimensions yeah the dimensions that's right pretty much d uh sorry did i say diago palkia palkia is just a giant ruler is really like like a tape measure oh it's more like graph paper yeah yeah that's really good because it does you know well but it also has the the y-axis as well you know it's like a graphing calculator wait which one is ty dial goes time diagonal this time because there's dial in its name so dialga got ripped off because palikia has got the x y and z dimensions yeah pokemon z confirmed and dialga just has the fourth dimension of time so a 3d animated rayquaza showed up for a hot second and when i say hot second i mean like 20 seconds of like screen time they went to the panel of like celebrities or um judges i don't know they think of like i'm so it's so hard to explain this just for the silly thing that they did but imagine like eight people sitting on very high stools like talking in between the space stuff at one point after the pikachu floats by and the rayquaza shows up there's like a guy sitting on one of his high stools and he holds up a nintendo switch with pokemon sword and shield and then he looks down at a piece of paper and then reads like the bullet points of sword and shield and then says there's a pikachu available and that's it like it was exactly what we said it was going to be which is an ad it was an ad for pokemon sorted shield that was in collaboration with the space event and they gave a free pikachu out and to be fair i wasn't expecting anything i was expecting to see a pikachu floating in space i got that i was not expecting a download for a pikachu but of course the internet's not never happy and they were upset that it's not a shiny pikachu i don't know but this is oh you can't use that audio podcast i'm moving my hands i would argue that a special ribbon pikachu is more rare than a shiny because how many special ribbon pikachus do you have i know the answer is zero now you have one speaking of getting ripped off uh this was sent in by kevin from our slack community uh we forgot to cover this last couple weeks it's not really brand new news but there is a giant life-size appleton plush that arrived in japan they are very large not that large like not as large as the zeraora life-size plush or the fur at life-size plush because appleton is not actually that big of a pokemon i had to do a little digging here so on the japanese pokemon center it is 8 500 yen which i think is like 75 usd which isn't too bad uh it's you know it's a lot cheaper than the five hundred dollar mareep plush it's a large boy though very happy appleton's could be ladies as well well i'm buying the boy version so i can put them on my couch next to my cats and go look at those boys you're a fool yeah he's uh they're pretty large and we have no clue if it's coming to the united states i guess the marie plush eventually arrived but the furret plush did not i suppose you could import it you could probably find a somebody in japan to walk to the pokemon center buy it to you and put it in a box and send it but i would suppose that would be very expensive shipping wise because of the size of the box that's real heavy here's the 200 youtube video idea you buy it and then you cut into it like an apple pie it's like buying one of those iphones and smashing it you're just doing it do you know appleton's wait that's the okay that's not flat bowl okay yes appleton's pokedex entry literally says that children would rip off strips of its back yeah to eat as snacks did you know that that's sick yeah it's terrible it's it's a slow poketail thing or the farfetch thing except that it's socially acceptable well it can probably regrow it back i'm assuming okay let me rip off strips of your back as snackers and see probably throw that back i'm not a pie nor a dragon kind of look like a pie to me if i was a pie it would be uh [Laughter] if you were a pie you would be what is like the most boring lemon meringue right there what no one likes lemon meringue it's just hanging favorite pie lemon bread is delicious all right take it back i'll be the lemon meringue no you can't beat lemon meringue pick your own pie i do like apple pie though what yeah what that's appleton yeah that's true can i be like a chocolate pie yeah you can be french silk yeah now we're talking yeah that's not that's a pie i mean theoretically i mean if lemon ranks by french silica pie true we covered this last week but we'll go through it again just because it's coming up uh the self pokemon go live the unova unova they say very fast in the anime always like that i don't know why they never slow it down the unova event is coming up starts on tuesday january 5th goes until january 10th it's a five-day event snivy will be shiny during this event although i'm doubting it's going to be comey day odds probably just going to be whatever the thing it is yeah so snivy ted pig oshawa lilly pup hurtier blitzel hurtier oh they did say lilly pup before it uh hurtier blitzel rock and roller drill burst greggy time pole venipede rubbish gothita solosis for raw seed will all be appearing in the wild if you're lucky you may encounter shiny snivy all right i've got two issues to bring up pokemon since we're in the pokemon go zone right now number one in the recording of the previous program i cannot believe this is how you can tell i wasn't here i cannot believe that this interchange went through uh when what what happened countdown to kanto event i wonder why they're going backwards in generation order it's kind of like it's a countdown really there's a lot of problems with this show yes a lot of problems especially when i'm not here to keep everybody in line jake you failed me number two i want to buy the kanto event ticket it does not appear anywhere in my pokemon go did you already buy it i did not already i bought the mr mime ticket but i did not buy the canto ticket and if i did where would i look to see if i already bought it uh it would be in your items it would be under your raid passes under my i have like 400 raid passes how am i going to find anything under there it'll be like a color would be like blue or pink or something i no i didn't here we go no that's shop that's not where i'm going bag items it would be by your raid pass slash remote raid pass slash premium battle pass all right this is i have rare candy raid pass remote raid pass premium battle pass star piece i thought you did buy it i thought you had to like reinstall the app that was for the mr mime event oh well then again it says right here ticket a ticket to access a special event on february 20th 24 21 i guess i did buy it dag well that's what happens when you're what color is it blue it's dark oh it is blue have we decided if we were in a texas or not i think the decision was that we're not going to texas oh okay uh there will be event exclusive field research with that reward stardust leads to encounters with pokemon such as snivy ted pig oshawa ferrara seed snivy ted pig oshawa timber dwell and clink will appear in one star raids herdier tranquil excadrill and amungus will remind you never to do three star raids um and then genesect holding the burn drive will be appearing of course no shiny genesect this event and a special wait when is that new raid pokemon coming mega charizard will become more powerful that week oh that must have been the other blog post i think there's a there's a new raid pokemon coming but i think it's next week i think it's this week and then the cino event starts on tuesday january 12th remakes confirmed yeah finally i'm in it finally which remakes they just forgot during the space event do you think they're gonna remake for the 25th anniversary they're gonna remake kanto again i think you're going to make it playable on the switch we can only hope well there there was that rumor that they were doing like the master collection oh right which i'll i'll i'll say it's a pretty weak rumor but i'll i'll maybe we haven't talked about this but uh the concept of the master collection i'm doing air quotes here remember we're in rumor territory was that it was going to be a switch version of red gold and ruby on one cartridge so those three games and then blue silver and sapphire on another cartridge and that it would be gosh i wanted to say it was between 40 and 60 dollars but you would get those three games on a cart and it would be a master collection and that was pretty much the rumor and i guess that's probably fine i guess i don't know what why they just why they should do individual cartridges and make us pay like thirty dollars for each one for each which they they'll package them all together thirty dollars each eighty nine ninety nine four three yeah i i i wouldn't be like upset if it came out as somebody who has recently in the last like year played all of those games i'm definitely not in the market to go back to red and blue anymore not either but that doesn't stop especially when like if you have the means like fire red leaf green i think is like a better version of those games and then if if you are a pokemon fan and you just played let's go pikachu let's go eevee you're probably one of the many people that have gotten your full scoop of kanto i mean i think i've played at least three different versions of kanto at this point i'm trying to think of all the ones because there was the first ones uh fire red and leaf green let's go eevee let's go pikachu i don't i think that's the only options are those it are those the three big remakes of kanto yeah i mean they put i i think the thing that people always bring up too is they put red and blue on the virtual console yeah but they also put yellow on the virtual controller and and golden silver and crystal and they wait they waited they waited until people bought gold and silver to put crystal out at a later date here's how's about this for a underground dark theory they make all no that doesn't work dag nabit i was gonna say they make the uh like game boy and gameboy advance games available on the switch through the nintendo online service virtual console but there's no game boy game boy advance virtual console it's only nintendo and super nintendo yeah there's not even nintendo 64 stuff right no no dagon i wish there was man gen 3 is i know it's your favorite region greg but original gen 3 is real hard to go back to all of them are really hard to go back here i tried to go back to yellow i really loved that game and i got halfway through it before i'm like i can't i can't play this so yesterday it is so frustrating to go so far backwards um and i have since played emerald many times after that and it is what was considered fun gameplay back then because it was your only option does not translate to fun gameplay now you know it's it's the it's the classic wow conundrum like i remember it was fun because i had no other option but the minute something was better i was happy to jump it's the same thing like i having all of those restrictions of those old games trying to play them now it's so frustrating to me because i want to do things faster or in a different way or have the quality of life changes and they just aren't there and it's such a frustrating experience for me i think what's going to happen is when we are eventually in retirement homes and enjoying a slower pace of life we're going to turn to those really slow paced heavy grind games and be like all right now i have the time and patience for this garbage if there was like a reason to go back and play them like the cool thing about crystal like when crystal came out there was really nothing to play pokemon wise because i believe crystal was after ultrasound ultramoon i think i think so so and and you know ultrasound ultramoon was november crystal came out i believe in in february so a lot of casual pokemon players they got their fill of pokemon and then they got different games for christmas where different games came out in january and then crystal came back and people like old pokemon games nothing wrong with that and so they came back for crystal and crystal seemed like a not like a big event but like uh like a little bump of like everyone's talking about pokemon again um and that was cool but at least when you went back to crystal or even the older games you could try one transfer those pokemon to pokemon bank um which i would assume if there was ever if this rumor was remotely true and there was a master collection or something of old games being put on the switch eventually i would assume that would be the case if they can make if they made it work before they can make it work again oh yeah everything goes into pokemon home now yeah but there's no going forward without that connectivity even pokemon shuffle goes into pokemon home at this point yeah but the cool thing about like the older games on the virtual console like crystal and stuff is if you caught a pokemon you would at least know that it would be guaranteed hidden ability and so it was like oh i could go back to another game yeah nostalgia well look at these gym leaders oh jasmine's here but you're like oh at least i caught him a reap and now it's a hidden hidden ability mureep but sword and shield kind of knocked down all those barriers to be like well it's pretty easy to get hidden ability or not hidden ability or timid or jolly or adamant or perfect ivs except they made it too easy yeah too easy so there would have to be another i feel like there would have to be something the other reason to go back to crystal was they put the celebi thing in it which was excluded from the american stuff uh which which i think was pretty smart and they gave you the ability to shiny han celebi if you cared to do so so they they gave you kind of like two reasons to go back to crystal one like easier hidden ability guaranteed pokemon and like that chris that celebi event that you could experience that that doesn't exist in gold and silver that was specifically a crystal event i guess they could put like no the deoxys event was for emerald right it wasn't for ruby and sapphire yeah it was framework they can get away with putting out old games and doing nothing to them maybe maybe i'm just not in the market for them i'm not sure why i would need to go back to emerald as i or not emerald ruby and sapphire as i just played them pretty recently and well that's you you play too much pokemon yeah that's my real problem yeah that's true i should really like start a podcast or something where i talk about how much pokemon i play no see this is the problem you need to do the opposite of that you just need to like take a six month vacation from pokemon play i don't know what's a good alternative to pokemon um you'll come back fresh no would you stop with your yu-gi-oh no not allowed well i i have like the i have i've had some time off of twitch because uh i wanted to spend time with irene and stuff and she was cooking dinner and i thought well like the players cup is coming up uh maybe i should do a couple practice matches so i'm on the couch i think it was the first time ever since sword and shield came out i'm playing pokemon on an actual tv because normally i'm playing it in front of my you know stream setup she's like what are you doing and i was like i'm just practicing for the player's cup and she's like you're working turn this off and i was like oh wow but i'm just playing pokemon anyways let's take a break and then we'll come back uh we're going to revisit an old article so we will be oh no into the wayback machine we'll be right back [Music] i mean i mean as those of us born in the 70s say you know that shiny and a coupon will get you a discount [Music] hey happy new

uh retrospective article before we go to the wayback machine bringing it back any update for you on the masters end greg like how bad my polls have been i mean is that what we want to talk about because they've been awful have you done the uh n event at all i have not started it yet i did the an event up until fighting end because i need to have a 125 team and blah blah blah blah and i'm like nah um it's the storyline is interesting like it's interesting it's an interesting add-on to the end of what happened in those series like a lot of these things are um so there's some cute moments in there uh i i haven't done the new year's eve events um but i i guess there's a a moment where you call lance out on gyarados not being a dragon oh that's cute which makes me laugh because his response is ha ha ha not all dragons are dragging type pokemon this is right i agree i agree i'm with you dude he's not wrong one one of the good things i will say one of the good things they do in masters which is not their pull system not their banner system and not the actual gameplay is who's ever writing their characters for the story lines has these people down like i don't think there's been a storyline that i haven't been interested in found charming or been like wow like the even even the fact that like cyrus is like i still hate people and i still think the world should be destroyed but i guess i'll hang out here at least they should have acknowledged that whole weirdness and just like this is who he is there's there's a number of things i think are really the writing in that game is really good it's probably one of the only things that keeps me coming back is i enjoy what they do with the characters whereas like the game doesn't bring me much in my polls i've i've pulled on every banner every time i have not gotten any any of th i'm so far out of ten polls got two five stars that weren't uh weren't the people on the banner i always post my recaps of what i pull on youtube and my last video i don't think i pulled anything good spoiler my luck has also been bad although they did give 3 000 gems for the new year from logging in yep i think n is available until close to the end of the month and then lance and lily are available until the 13th i don't know that the lily in rabambi is any good i just want that pair yeah they're very cute they're very cute i really want that pair and but i have not gotten that full disclosure i am partnered with dna uh but i will say really now i will say the main reason i come to the game is because i do like to collect the characters but uh i i like getting one of every character and i missed out on erica i never got her now i gotta wait a whole year well assuming she's coming back it could be like regalia lost where they have christmas in july and the christmas events came back in july oh uh interesting there was there was a question i saw floating around the internet i won't say where of whether pokemon masters will even last till next christmas and the only reason that is brought up is because pokemon duel lasted i want to say almost two years and rumble world or whatever it was called only lasted a year magikarp jump was never like a well maybe to some people it was a lifelong game i i am a i'm a jump lifer uh but i still jump every day but i think i think masters is doing or has been doing better than at least well any anything in the entire world was doing better than rumble yeah i think there's still more people playing it i don't think it's as much but that's pretty normal but i think i'll be around for a while i mean yeah i don't see why it would end before its second anniversary especially with this year being the 25th year i think if anything come february they would probably do some sort of event to correspond with the 25th anniversary and to probably that would be their big push of like okay we need to do something because pokemon is on the brain for a lot of people and how do we put butts into masters i mean i think masters is a sufficiently popular game yeah that it's yeah i mean the fact that those other games died out is because nobody was playing them right right people are actually playing masters and spending money on it so i mean yes it's not making as much money as pokemon go but what it is exactly last thing before we move on i don't try i always try to keep our masters talks under 10 minutes otherwise you got 10 minutes to knit or crochet yeah right cross stitch are people get a cross stitch in 2021 is that a thing that's going to come back what do you mean it never went away dude we had people who appeared on this program who are adamant cross you need to be in our crafty scrafty group in the slack community but i'm not crafty or scrafty you can still see everyone's beautiful cross stitch project i'll jump in it'd be one of the many things that i'm like oh i have to read this last question for you greg did you notice the difference between um every four minutes versus every six minutes for the refresh no because i literally play once a day okay so you're probably why is this a question for greg maybe i started playing pokemon masters did you no you could try it though you did try it you didn't like me there's a lot of things i don't like about it the thing is is that i'm over the stamina limit i'm keeping myself at uh 796 so that i feel back up to the top in case something comes along that i really want to do so i i i don't regenerate so i i wouldn't see it that's i used to play that way before they'd stopped giving us the plethora of stamina but now i feel like so i normally play twice a day i normally when i wake up in the morning after i'm done checking my email and if there's still a cat laying on my feet and i can't get out of bed because every morning i log log into masters and then i try not to take the 200 stamina because i don't want it to because i want it to replenish so then i just spend it on something like it literally anything normally it's like oh i don't have time to think i'll just you know do sync orbs or i'll just do soda plus red minus two four six eight whatever the sodas are called and then at night before i go to bed i log in to see how much sam and i have and then to cash in the 200 because that only lasts 24 hours and then try to spend that so then when i wake up in the morning it's refreshed that's how normally i play and i do notice that well obviously i mean you didn't need the game to be out to like calculate how much damage you get versus six months for four minutes it's more full more often yeah yeah i just don't i don't play any of my gadget games like down to down to zero unless there's some some massive event where i have to get to the end to get the reward and then i will but then usually i only play once a day to get to get my login and do stuff i i tend not to think of these games apart from the one time that they forced me to log in probably because i'm paying i i just play too many of them and so i sort of cycle through them and then i'm like okay i need i need to do something else with my life i will say it's a lot harder for me to play more than once when i'm at home and i have more compelling things that i want to play like i could be spending time playing this or i could be playing oxygen not included or sword and shield or final fantasy 14 uh so i just if i was trapped in my office on a conference call that was boring like when i go back to work i might play it more because i might be back on on calls again all right i wanted to uh revisit an old article this is uh from usgamer we did talk about this on the show this was published june 13th 2019 about 18 months ago what is the title of this i don't think that it doesn't look like there is a title [Laughter] the i guess the title is the pokemon sword and shield interview quote we knew at some point we weren't going to be able to keep indefinitely supporting all pokemon end quote we talked to gamefreak about battle potential of dynamics the decision to narrow down the number of available pokemon and to move into a new era um so we won't go over this whole interview but i remember we we covered an old interview a couple months ago and a lot of people came out of the woodwork that's an expression right yes that is the expression used correctly i'm quite impressed 2021 i get we've grown we're beating around the bush once again no we're not we're not like sand through our fingers so i at this point this is this is before sword and shield even came out this is june 13th um this is a couple days after the e3 announcement so before we dive in let's kind of okay before we dive in why are we going back to this why one because it's a slow new suite has anyone told japan that we're revisiting this article good did anyone tell america that they launched pikachu into space did they so there was no plushie shoved out of an airlock nothing no there was nobody said pikachu is sush and ejected him and tossed him pikachu is sus that is the slogan of 2021 pikachu is kinda suss kinda well i i actually dug up this article to argue with somebody on the internet about oh good and you're dragging us into your argument no because i oh no no the answer is yes the argument's irrelevant but when i when i dug up the article because i was like because the article specifically i was looking for the interview where they talked about how max raid battles in sword and shield and max ray battles in pokemon go were developed at the same time which his article does state okay and then i was rereading the article earlier this week and i was like wow there's it's kind of interesting how we had thoughts and our minds went to a bunch of different places and then sword and shield came out and now it feels like this is a brand new article again even though i've read it probably a hundred times before sword and shield came out so i wanted to i wanted to revisit it uh because now we've had two dlcs sword and shield has been out for a year we're a month away from the 25th anniversary and so i thought it would be fun um as i figured this week of news would be terribly short so i'm going to make will be amore here okay and i will a morty i will i will be the interviewer which one are we going with which question uh let's go with the pokemon go one which is second question below the video it goes and for max raids did you look to pokemon go for inspiration for raid battles that are in that and what do you feel you're going to do with sword and shield that will take max raid battles to the next level i think both features were being developed around the same time both the pokemon go raid battles and and max raid battles while we were working on development of the game really with a similar goal of having more ways for players to kind of play with each other specifically what we wanted to do with max raid battles was give a cooperative battle experience you can always battle against friends but that kind of pvp oriented competitive play can be intimidating to some players we wanted to offer an experience where you can easily get a friend and have them join you on something where you can challenge a really strong opponent and have a good time okay so how does that hold up uh having a good time that's i mean i've had some good times i've had a lot of good times with raids i've had a lot of good times like the really challenging part one is is only when they did the mewtwo stuff and some dynamics avengers otherwise it was pretty much for people have you done dynamics adventures though i mean people are bad at pokemon no see that's the thing is right greg you have to take this from the perspective of somebody who doesn't think pokemon all the time every week there are plenty of people who just don't realize how tough and impressive that's relicanth is we go that's true i mean i have no sock this is a this is a small sample of the pokemon world but you know i have a bunch of people watching me play pokemon every day like they're in my twitch chat they're they're chit chatting i'm i'm do i'm playing pokemon every day you know no no shade to them but when i do max raid battles with them there are just basic battle things that they don't know and it's fine there's like 800 some moves and there's 600 pokemon available but when they're in a battle and they use something like steel roller and there's no terrain up well like steel roller is going to fail it needs terrain and you wasted a whole move and that move could be like the i have done i i have done landorus look i don't know what is in max raid battles i only know at the end that landorus appears if there are other pokemon that appear at the end of a max raid battle i don't know who they are i only also need to own up to the person who doesn't pay attention and has brought a storm drain pokemon and then complains why so and so isn't using water gun all the time when they are and your pokemon is the one that's eating it up but you need to own your own behavior sbj look if i have an opportunity to pick miraculous i'll pick miractus i know but then you gotta pay attention enough to not complain that people in your chat aren't playing right when you're the one that is ruining the mo i tell people not to use the water move when i get miraculous yeah after you remember i have watched you many times when you're like what why are they using water gun and chad has to say because you brought a storm drain steve hey i started off this conversation saying people were bad at pokemon there's no lies including you no lies have been detected you also started out by saying i play it professionally 24 7. i don't know entertainment pokemon master playing for years but even even like the amount of times i've i've gone to into landorus and i'm like hey we should maybe take the grass path and people are like oh anders is flying ground it's like yet one lander says no any flying type moves trust me i've battled it eight million times two it knows two ground type moves one is bulldoze one is earthquake and grass pokemon resist ground and if you set up grassy terrain not only do grass pokemon resist ground but grassy terrain halves the amount of damage from earthquake and halves the amount of damage from bulldoze for every pokemon in the field it's very very good against landorus and a lot of people don't know that and we've i have failed my fair share of landorus raids i will say i think dynamaxx adventure is a better system than max raid battles in the terms of being a bit more challenging and requiring you to think but i don't think that max raid battles should go away and or should be harder i think there is a good balance between of like this this is a little bit harder this is a little bit easier but they could make it harder like they did with mewtwo um or the five star zera aura that was shiny was like harder right i'm almost positive yes but that was hard to find yeah but those were the two challenges like mewtwo and then like the shiny zero aura and there was really nothing you didn't really get anything from chinese aurora it was just like bragging rights that you were able to beat it but it would feel weird going into a future pokemon game if there wasn't this kind of co-op and i don't want i don't want to be one of those people that hang on to sos forever or horde battles because that's what i always hear is like i wish they would bring back horde battles i wish they would bring back sos those are mechanics that existed for either you know shiny hunting or fast eevee training or hidden abilities but that's totally different than a co-op feature which i think does add a lot of value for this game and for future games if i can say like hey on monday night we're going to get a bunch of people together and we're going to play together you know kind of like an mmo yeah oh you mean like pokemon go yeah but better with a storyline and hey listen in pokemon go you're the storyline it's a pretty bad storyline let's do the question below will what do you envision the end game and single player post game content is going to be like in terms of what people can do after they beat the campaign a lot of people want to play a little bit longer so what do you plan on doing are you looking for additional updates or anything like that i can't really say too much today of course but i do want to say it's not just the story and then you're done with the game we've got a lot of content for players to enjoy after they finish the story also for players who are really big fans of the battle system and the competitive scene there's going to be a lot for them to engage with i think that is a true response yeah they're on season seven series series seven series seven but season twelve of the game so that means the rule so seasons are monthly so every season you can qualify for master rank which gives you 600 battle points three golden bottle caps dynite ore armoritor etc and you can earn up to 1200 if you place both single and double battles battle points but series where on series 7 means rule changes so for example series 1 you couldn't use a lot of gmax pokemon um and like gmax lapras i think was introduced in series four and then series six was the ban uh of like incineroar and rillaboom and togekiss and dragapult and series 7 added the crown tundra legendaries which is why landorus is back and so we know that series 8 will be february and we don't know the rules for that we don't know if that's going to be another ban we don't know if that's going to be like guess what you can use mewtwo now even though mewtwo's not good people would probably use like kyogre groudon because those are actually pretty decent for players who are really big fans of the battle system and competitive scene there's gonna be a lot to engage with that sentence is is very very true although they probably didn't expect a global pandemic but i think they pivoted pretty well as we're having now the third player cup coming up players cup coming up a lot of content for people to enjoy after the story that could be a reference to the dlc but they have changed raids every month there was the the post game story line with sword burt and shield i think that still counts as just story there is what else can you do after you do the game you can go to the rose tower yeah explore the wild area i guess yeah because after you beat leon technically you open up all the weather conditions for the wild area because you can't i'm almost positive before you beat leon you're not allowed to get fog in the wild area at all no what yeah it's like they're i think fog and then something else doesn't ever happen in the wild area until you beat leon are you making that up no i'm not i mean maybe i'm hallucinating it but i think yeah something along those lines but there there is a couple wild area things that are restricted until after you beat leon there's something else that you can do after you beat the game huh i guess you you can't get fog until you beat the what hey see you know what i've never done i've i have never gone back to pier's gym to battle marnie that's a thing you can do is it really yeah yeah i've never done it me either because i didn't know that that was a thing yeah because she takes over as gym leader right but i don't know what piers does he's a rock star dude he's too early i thought she was just outside and he was still the gym leader am i oh well i haven't done it so i don't know the story i mean i think i've seen her outside man there's a lot that i don't it's been a long it's been i mean i guess catching zashian or zamasu well that's part of the story burt shielberg storyline yeah you have there's a whole thing you have to do to unlock her as a gym battle and i don't think i've done that you can complete your career decks that's another thing still i've never done that oh yeah me i'm so behind in sword and shield stuff but i'm gonna get there someday yeah i mean what's gonna happen is when they announce whatever the next iteration of the console based games greg yes be wary of the words that you speak but whenever they announce the next iteration of whatever the games are going to be for the console games i will get a fire under me to complete everything in sword and shield so that i'll be ready for the next games i mean i spent two years breeding a shiny bug team and i'm like crawling through pokemon shield with it do you see sword and shield being a kind of jumping off point for future poke for the future of the pokemon series because you're not only watching sword and shield but also pokemon home pokemon bank and a lot of things coming up around it does it feel like this is a new era in the pokemon series all right i'm a different guy this time i'm mr janichi or do you want to be masuda greg you be masuda i think it might be fair to say it's not a transition but for example at game freak omori-san is the director for these games who are passing a lot of responsibility to the younger generation to kind of move the franchise forward also being on the nintendo switch allows for new play styles not just handheld but also on the tv screen i think it's definitely going to represent a new chapter for pokemon pokemon game is appealing to like a younger crowd like every pokemon game is eventually somebody's first pokemon game well that's not what they mean by younger generation it just means that mr massoud is ready to retire and hand off the reins onto somebody else i know we've talked about this on the show before but obviously that was probably a long time ago and we brought up masuda and masuda gets a lot of blame if anything in pokemon goes wrong so so amore was the director of sword and shield they were the director of sun and moon and then they were also the director of omega ruby alpha sapphire so those were the three main games they directed they've obviously they were a producer um let's go pikachu let's go eevee they were a producer on ultrasound ultra moon they were a planning director on x and y i don't know the difference between a planning director and a director but whatever whatever that means yeah it doesn't make a difference and then for masuda they were a director on crystal although they weren't completely in charge of crystal they were a director on ruby and sapphire on fire red leaf green on diamond and pearl on black and white on x and y and on let's go pikachu let's go eevee those were the games masuda was the director on and masuda has done a lot more than just direct obviously masuda did a lot of music um they've done scenario plot they've done story plot they've done world design have done they did all the music for sun and moon x and y black two white two black and white heart gold soul silver diamond pearl fire red leaf green ruby sapphire let's go pikachu let's go eevee so they didn't do music for omega ruby f sapphire i'm sure they did some music but they weren't in charge of like the entire soundtrack uh there has been a lot of focus on collaborative play as well i mentioned the ray battles already but it feels like this one is trying to do a lot of multiplayer things was it important that pokemon also be cooperative as well as competitive and how much did you weigh those two sides of pokemon yeah i think it's more of a sense of getting a lot of players to play together maybe not necessarily cooperatively but playing together in a game world a shared kind of space almost one of the cool things about nintendo switch is obviously you can take it with you so you go out and maybe go to a friend's house and you can cooperate together like oh let's do a match now and you take on this really strong pokemon but communication has always been a central theme to pokemon so having more ability to communicate not just through traditional features but also talking to each other while going up against a single opponent that kind of cooperative stuff is definitely the focus then they should fix the wacom oh i mean dynamics adventure is like the better the better way to connect it absolutely is just give me an eight-digit code what's your code all right cool we're together we don't have to worry about friend codes or whether i can see you on a list and also seeing other people in the wild area is not the best experience no no it would be nice if there was a way to find your friends easier oh definitely again whether there was like an eight digit code of like i want to enter this wild area maybe next game even even if there was a way to turn the y com to just friends list only if there's just not everybody in the world but there was a middle thing like only people on my friends list would be nice because trying to like we're all in the same area but it's randomly picking five people from the world to show me instead of the people who are on my friends list it's so frustrating i've definitely found friends in the wild area yeah i have two but by accident not because the game made it easy it was like all right let's go i'll go to the island i'm going to be spinning this is what i'm wearing all right you leave the wild area keep coming back in back and forth all right we found each other back and forth okay the game is finally chosen because it would be fun to be able to do more camping with people like i might complete my curry decks if i did that yeah that was kind of like the main thing is i mean seeing another person is cool but you can't really do anything with them besides like talk to them and get like sausage from them um yeah but they did design something to do with somebody which is the curry i mean to be fair it's easy to do if you're offline and in the same room together that's true that is true that has just not been uh a thing for for a bit but just like every video game it's more fun with people and if i'm sitting there making curry by myself it would be it's just it's just a better experience and um at least for me people that were watching my streams were not interested in curry but until they saw me do it and when we did find people in the area and we were all doing it together other people were like wow this is cool because you guys are doing it together i want to do it together which is probably part of the reason why sword shield is has done very well compared to past pokemon games one in the sense that the switch is incredibly popular um but two is because when you add i feel my opinion when you add co-op stuff to games it is easier to get people to participate and be excited and extend the longevity of that because you're doing something with somebody else like an mmo greg yep yep yep yep that's what i'm waiting for 20 20 25 pokemon world i'm excited for it on the switch pro 3x5 last question here is talking about dynmax adventure how do you feel that changes the way players are going to approach pokemon and what sort of opportunities did you add to change the way people play pokemon battles it's going to add a whole new layer a tactical element to the battles we've had power up gameplay features like mega evolution and z moves in the past but dynamaxx is something that can be used with any pokemon in the game so that gives the chance for any pokemon to shine in battle it also kind of creates a situation where you have to read your opponent because you don't know which pokemon they're going to power up in battle so as a competitive player how true is that i mean when you see the list of four pokemon how often are you actually surprised at which one dynamax is it 50 50 is it like 25 of the time it's i didn't expect that like what what's your percentage i think the thing is like you you have multiple pokemon you can dynamax right so if i'm looking at a team and i see they have a grim snarl i i could probably say with confidence 99 of the time the grim snarl is not going to dynamics but also like the same with dust clops you know dust collapse is a support pokemon it's normally there to set up trick room it might know willowist it probably knows nightshade it might know a move to activate weakness policy like brick break or bulldoze or shadow sneak but it's not there to do damage but with that being said i've seen top players specifically on the ladder and when i say top players i mean like top 100 in the world i've seen a player dynamax their dust clops because that was their win condition they dynamaxed it they used max phantasm and they were able to win in that situation is it rare yeah totally i would say probably like 99.9 percent of the time you're not going to dynamax desktops but because you have the option to it can still add a variance to the battle and they were they they won um because they dynamax the dusk claps uh but when you see like certain pokemon you can expect those dynomax like gla glass glass trier is a probably going to be the dynamaxxer charizard probably going to be the dynamaxer metagross cortana like these are pokemon that you can look at and go yeah they're probably going to dynamax those or when you look at their team you're like well how does their team beat my team and this is probably the one they're going to dynamax so to compare that to older games which i don't have that level of knowledge for compared to sword and shield uh i mean if you saw kangaskhan on a team in in like x and y or omega ruby or sun and moon you go well there's no way it's not running their mega stone and if you there were certain pokemon like tapacoco where you were very very confident that it was going to have a z move attached to it um because that's just how the meta was at the time there is always going to be some sort of gimmick to pokemon even in black and white i guess the gimmick was um the gems the gem system and that's why tornadoes and thunder or not tornadoes yeah tornadoes and thunderous were pretty good because they would run like one attack and it would be like acrobatics maybe hallucia too and then acrobatics was like stronger if the pokemon wasn't holding a held item i think yeah so you would get the gem boost initially it would consume the gem and then the move would still be just as powerful um so gems were kind of like baby z moves and as much as people still loved mega evolution again i talked about this all the time but there was only like 10 pokemon that really took advantage of mega evolution there were a lot more pokemon that took advantage of z moves or could take advantage of z moves you could maybe make the argument that only x amount of pokemon dynamax but i would probably say that's like triple the amount of pokemon that could mega evolve i mean i i have a team right now that has porygon on it and i have probably done close to like 150 battles but in the 150 battles i have dynamaxx porygon once and i dynamaxed it in a position in a situation where i won i won because i dynamics porygon and out of 150 battles i only did it once but it worked and i won with it so i don't think dynamaxx is going to last forever though i think there will be another gimmick in future games that they rely on because i think the gimmicks are what sell the game right like the changes yeah people will always remember sword and shield you know in 20 years of that's the game with the big pokemon just like you remember x and y is like that's the game that introduced megas and i guess you go well that's the game that introduced z moves for sun and moon so i i think dynamaxx is is cool for now but i i i expect it's not going to last forever yeah i agree that was our that was our looking back at an old article hopefully it was all right we can move on to question of the week question time let's start off the new year with a great new question welcome to the first question of 2021 make it good steve ah there's a there's there's a lot of good ones here maybe maybe we could speed run these let's do it all right let's go brandon if you were at the pokemon company you could make the event for the 25th anniversary what would it be and how would it work thanks that's a real speed run question sure so like we're talking like not like okay to limit this down in-game event or like up uh buy tickets to go to event which we want i would say you do whatever you want i would say in-game event i've always been so i here i'll go first i've always been a huge fan of in-game events that celebrate the anniversary and pokemon go has been really good at doing that every year because they're like a live game and so in the sun and moon era and before that it just never seemed like they acknowledged those players uh as as easy as it was of like look give us a free decidueye or something give us something that we can download to like signify an anniversary so in the realm of games existing now that would probably be the best they could do in future games it would be cool if they could do what masters does or um which is like update the pokemon center uh yeah and i think that would be a really like not easy thing but that would be really like nice if during events or during holidays you know at least the pokemon centers throughout the region they're all the same uh could be like decorated and stuff for this anniversary i would i don't know i would expect what we're gonna get which is probably release date for detective pikachu release date for pokemon snap probably a trailer for an upcoming switch pokemon game and then like two things that we have no clue what's happening my thing for the 25 year university i so you know how we all voted on the top 10 of each region yeah on google yeah that for each month those are all like one like kanto is let's say april so all max raid battles like they pick three from each for amongst the four weeks and those are special max raid battles like they make those super cool and then the next one so they switch to johto and then hoenn and all the way up to to the end of the year so like they take that list and make those uh promoted raid max raid battles uh so you'd have like a region a month i would do a pokemon arg and it just like have it be like there's a hidden clue in whatever announcement for like they do like a poster or something for celebrating 25 years of pokemon and there's a little clue in there and then you follow the clues and you have like a full year to solve the arg and then whoever wins gets to design the next a new pokemon or something there you go args that stuff's real hot right still yeah yep uh next question what this is from mark from our slack what or who would you which wait which mark because get confu mark g okay that dude asks a lot of questions what what are who would you like this hey they they're paying for it what or who would you like to see the pokemon company partner with in the future i am holding out for a special pikachu edition tesla tesla dude i want a much like a yokai watch event in ff14 i want a pokemon event i wanted to have 900 minions that i have to add and all 900 have weapons that i can get minions yeah oh you mean not like the thing from the movie not the thing with the one eye no like the things that follow you yes much in line with greg i want a pokemon monster hunter crossover yeah that would be would the weapons be pokemon instead of like i'm a horn player i am a pikachu player or no are you replacing no monsters with pokemon no you would have armor and weapon sets that were themed on pokemon oh okay oh i'd be into that i've never played those games but yeah well monster hunter rice coming out march 26 2021 i'm gonna i feel like we've answered this question i'm gonna i want to see some pokemon in mario kart they put animal crossing in it yeah they put zelda in it let me let me drive a pikachu let me drive ass pikachu yeah do you want to be yeah you want mario at the back of peach pikachu zipping around we've all played dash we know how successful that would be yeah it's a great game um so good i do now that i've received um merch from original stitch which i full disclosure partnered with original stitch they sent me the kramer ant shirt um it is so nice and as somebody who spent with the two of you several days looking at dress clothing and looking at prices and going to how many stores do we go to like a dozen uh yeah we went we for sure went to 10. i wasn't keeping count um they are so nice the quality is is incredibly nice and it's really cool that they are doing hoenn next i am excited i might actually buy a shirt yeah i love the skinny one um have they have you seen them have you seen them no i i've only seen the ones on the website they've shown like 10 uh hoenn ones and one of them is skitty and the others are the starters but the skinny one is for sure my next one um but they're they're really nice they're super expensive though they're like a hundred dollars a shirt um which is it's that's it should be nice at 100 yeah they should be that's like the same price at like a men's warehouse but the difference is like men's warehouse is always on sale but you play you pay for the pokemon tax so i i do like that they keep collaborating with stuff i just can't think of a i can't think of like a brand i can't think of like an irl brand off the top of my head that isn't just like partner with a video game which is there's nothing wrong with that i mean monster under final fantasy mario kart i'm just trying to think of like another like they're partnering with the north face but we haven't i don't think we've seen everything in that collection yet ooh certainly did you see certainly i agree with that because you know i not gonna use bad language but i love me some surly bikes but the uh clanging and banging gear is now available in pokemon center.com yeah i might buy some of that what are you know oh the new workout gear yeah what do you think clanging and banging me at first i thought i was like are they selling weights i mean if they sold weights i would make a home gym i would need to find space to make they do have active performance stuff they do i'm kind of i received an email was did they single me out because i'm the king of clanging and banging i got the email too i didn't wait did i go to email you should have this is going to be the what was the email it was it just it was pokemon center right yeah yeah thank you for shopping anywhere

christmas and it was the winter fest for kids maybe they think i'm like 12. you've fallen off the list i kind of really really want the active crew shirt like i need another gym shirt i mean not that i'm going to the gym right now but ring fit i do do ring fit except i hurt my foot so i've been off doing anything until my foot heels i thought we were speed running oh yeah sorry last one is from uh mabel now that it's the year of the ox will pokemon company finally give us our favorite bo vines they love they well pokemon company finally give us our favorite bovines the love that they truly

we can make the booth come back i you know i'm kind of into this i'm kind of into it too all right this is the worst i love the booth uh the answer is no they will not all right that's speed run no speed run pokemon of the week okay the previous oh dagnabbit i had to close it when i restarted my computer the previous week's pokemon of the week was i was in the pokemon trivia contest and i had forgotten that this pokemon existed um even though it's been around for 25 years good clue for you right there uh i always forget that it's name uh and i made a reference to gum shoes there and then uh i also mentioned that its prior evolutions follow a naming convention kind of like gibbel and gabite but instead of like garchomp the one that i'm referring to here doesn't follow the same naming pattern um and then i reference gyarados and then there's a fact that its name refers to a story in i guess the jewish tradition um but that story is actually represented by different pokemon go let and go lurk um and then uh it's i mentioned that it's shiny kind of looks like a nugget but it's not related to golden or gold duck i how much more clue could i get you guys what do you got it's goldeen or golduck no it's golem golem there you go you forgot the gold existed because i because i mean you get like a billion geodudes in life yeah true and you have to trade it away battlers and then golem is like it has an all-in form yeah correct true uh mustachioed bearded joy that is alolan golem no other pokemon is the same type combination as a lowland golem and its evolutionary relatives the shiny is really good yeah it's like a golden nugget yeah the designer of alolan golem also made uh mega bee drill uh the honeage line the pangoro line tai the tyrant amora line grubbin line drampa helped on ultra necrozma and in sword and shield they did the rookie line and they did all the fossils wow like every fossil ever no all the fossils in shield okay maybe you should be one of the fossils from sword and shield this year which is the most derpy one well the one no one likes is the arctic fish yeah it's the year of octobush that's all right are you ready for uh i'm gonna state something controversial go for it the alolan pokemon shuffle icon is way better than the kanto pokemon shuffle icon i don't controverse you i agree with you that why did they feel the need to include the hands the hands are bad and looks like it's got weird lips yeah it's not i don't like it it's not good the rumble rush alolan golem is pretty so bad it's like it's so bad it's good the legs are like what oh man okay what's what's our next you ready the first pokemon of 2021 of pokemon here we go no i have to compose myself if you can remember my third wife's name this week's pokemon will be an easy guess for you i was never able to tease her by calling her by this pokemon's name because we were divorced about five years before its debut i frequently think of this pokemon as representing a diurnal cycle and it shares typing with both of the true diurnal pokemon but it is actually representative of a different cycle one that repeats approximately 12.3601 times every calendar year oddly enough with its paired pokemon it does not represent full and new as i have been looking into this pokemon i have found that there are three pokemon that pretty much represent the same thing bonus points if you can figure out all three one is ordinary and two are legendary there you go not not too tough to start out the year all right uh we'll be back next week uh and i will be back on twitch on january 8th taking some time off to revamp some twitch give myself a break uh there will still be youtube videos this week so every monday the podcast goes up on youtube and then
