guests we have Hannah here (0:54 - 0:58)
hello (0:57 - 1:00)
happy to be here (0:58 - 1:04)
um and then uh some some people are like (1:00 - 1:06)
you didn't introduce Bob last week uh (1:04 - 1:09)
you know some people don't don't want (1:06 - 1:12)
that whole Fanfare uh but I think most (1:09 - 1:14)
people at least in our community or (1:12 - 1:16)
slack Community should know who Hannah (1:14 - 1:18)
is at this point (1:16 - 1:21)
yeah I would hope so (1:18 - 1:23)
I've been around I've been around for a (1:21 - 1:25)
while I've been a listener for (1:23 - 1:28)
probably almost 10 years and I have a (1:25 - 1:30)
slack for a while and I've done the (1:28 - 1:34)
daily goings podcast not currently but I (1:30 - 1:36)
did a Pokemon go daily podcast for a (1:34 - 1:38)
time that I really enjoyed (1:36 - 1:40)
I remember I also remember when we first (1:38 - 1:43)
met you traded me a Tropius yes I did my (1:40 - 1:47)
family went specifically so the only the (1:43 - 1:49)
one and only uh (1:47 - 1:51)
International vacation my family has (1:49 - 1:53)
ever taken was to Spain we went (1:51 - 1:54)
specifically to the southern tip of (1:53 - 1:57)
Spain just to catch Tropius (1:54 - 2:00)
really (1:57 - 2:00)
freshman when chopias came out too it (2:00 - 2:04)
was (2:03 - 2:06)
yeah it was you've been there now for (2:04 - 2:09)
like what two three years I think (2:06 - 2:14)
before covid yeah yeah (2:09 - 2:14)
it's definitely he's been out for a (2:14 - 2:19)
while yep (2:16 - 2:19)
okay so we have uh two things this show (2:19 - 2:25)
although I'm sure we'll get sidetracked (2:22 - 2:28)
uh there was a a 1.1 (2:25 - 2:32)
1.1.0 update for (2:28 - 2:32)
scarlet and violet almost said sword and (2:32 - 2:35)
shield (2:34 - 2:38)
um and then there was uh some (2:35 - 2:42)
misinformation around a quote which I (2:38 - 2:43)
figured was gonna happen when I saw it (2:42 - 2:46)
so I we have the actual quote there's a (2:43 - 2:47)
whole interview that we could probably (2:46 - 2:49)
go through but I (2:47 - 2:51)
try to keep the show to an hour this (2:49 - 2:54)
week the key word is to try uh then I (2:51 - 2:56)
went to the LA Ultra Beast event which (2:54 - 2:58)
Bobby said he was going to go to and he (2:56 - 3:02)
didn't go to I did not say that at all (2:58 - 3:05)
wow and there there's an eight dollar (3:02 - 3:08)
Keldeo event coming so perfect for this (3:05 - 3:10)
uh episode because you both play Go (3:08 - 3:12)
pretty heavily (3:10 - 3:15)
um so we'll talk about some go but (3:12 - 3:16)
um people want to hear about Scarlet (3:15 - 3:18)
Violet so we're going to start with that (3:16 - 3:21)
uh and uh I just pulled the the notes (3:18 - 3:23)
Here off nintendolife.com Pokemon (3:21 - 3:25)
scarlet and violet version (3:23 - 3:29)
1.1.0 now available uh Nintendo (3:25 - 3:31)
apologizes for performance bug issues (3:29 - 3:33)
also I didn't put in the show notes but (3:31 - 3:34)
we could talk about Charizard (3:33 - 3:36)
uh because when when you're not talking (3:34 - 3:38)
about Charizard you should be talking (3:36 - 3:41)
about Charizard (3:38 - 3:43)
always it's the only Pokemon that (3:41 - 3:44)
deserves (3:43 - 3:48)
uh is newsworthy every single day for (3:44 - 3:50)
the last 25 years (3:48 - 3:53)
um so this update came in about 12 days (3:50 - 3:57)
uh from game release uh it did this is (3:53 - 3:59)
what this is what the show notes or the (3:57 - 4:02)
the update notes said they did uh season (3:59 - 4:04)
one of ranked battle will kicked off (4:02 - 4:06)
will allow you to enjoy ranked battles (4:04 - 4:09)
to the battle Stadium (4:06 - 4:12)
um an issue that an issue has been fixed (4:09 - 4:14)
to cause music not to play correctly (4:12 - 4:15)
during the battle with the Elite Four (4:14 - 4:17)
and the top champion in the victory road (4:15 - 4:20)
path and then other select bug fixes (4:17 - 4:22)
have been made (4:20 - 4:24)
um so there was quite a few things that (4:22 - 4:26)
can be fixed there was also another note (4:24 - 4:28)
we'll get to (4:26 - 4:28)
um (4:28 - 4:31)
did we talk about on this show the RNG (4:28 - 4:33)
issue (4:31 - 4:35)
I don't know if we I don't think we did (4:33 - 4:36)
that last time I don't think so no I (4:35 - 4:38)
don't think so so for those who don't (4:36 - 4:39)
play competitive there was actually a (4:38 - 4:43)
really big issue with competitive (4:39 - 4:46)
um what would happen is that (4:43 - 4:49)
how do I make this as simple as possible (4:46 - 4:53)
all RNG has to span from some other (4:49 - 4:56)
source of RNG so the base source of RNG (4:53 - 4:59)
was always the same so what happened is (4:56 - 5:01)
when you did certain move combinations (4:59 - 5:03)
they would always react the same way so (5:01 - 5:05)
the biggest one and the one that people (5:03 - 5:08)
were abusing before VGC kicked off here (5:05 - 5:10)
a couple days ago was that if a Pokemon (5:08 - 5:14)
faked out the whatever Pokemon was next (5:10 - 5:16)
to it no matter what move they used (5:14 - 5:18)
whether it was 90 accurate or 50 (5:16 - 5:21)
accurate or 30 accurate it would always (5:18 - 5:23)
be a hundred percent accurate because (5:21 - 5:27)
the RNG was always the same so you would (5:23 - 5:29)
see a Pokemon fake out and then the (5:27 - 5:30)
Pokemon next to it would use move like (5:29 - 5:33)
sheer cold which one hit Kos no matter (5:30 - 5:35)
what and it would always be 100 accurate (5:33 - 5:38)
there's another RNG not as (5:35 - 5:40)
that if if you were in the right side (5:38 - 5:41)
slot (5:40 - 5:43)
so Pokemon comes on the left Pokemon (5:41 - 5:45)
comes on the right if you're on the (5:43 - 5:47)
right side slot and you used a 90 (5:45 - 5:50)
accurate move so like heat wave it would (5:47 - 5:52)
always miss if you went first (5:50 - 5:55)
because again the RNG was always set so (5:52 - 5:57)
you could guarantee it every time (5:55 - 5:59)
and again I don't know if I said this (5:57 - 6:02)
last week or just in the various amount (5:59 - 6:04)
of streaming or other podcasts I've done (6:02 - 6:07)
is they would have had to do an update (6:04 - 6:09)
because there was no way game freak was (6:07 - 6:12)
going to allow season one competitive to (6:09 - 6:16)
have this broken RNG seed so (6:12 - 6:19)
uh all they said was you know season one (6:16 - 6:21)
of ranked battles kicked off they didn't (6:19 - 6:23)
mention that they fixed this although (6:21 - 6:26)
I'm not sure how many people this (6:23 - 6:27)
I'm not sure how many people are doing (6:26 - 6:28)
competitive since a lot of people are (6:27 - 6:29)
still playing for the game but anyways (6:28 - 6:31)
anyways it's all fixed well did they (6:29 - 6:33)
ever acknowledge that it or they never (6:31 - 6:34)
acknowledged it was broken right so yeah (6:33 - 6:35)
there's no reason to acknowledge that (6:34 - 6:37)
it's next (6:35 - 6:39)
correct (6:37 - 6:40)
um (6:39 - 6:43)
I heard about the Elite Four issue (6:40 - 6:45)
um of the music not playing correctly uh (6:43 - 6:47)
and I heard the Elite Four music was (6:45 - 6:49)
really good I'm not gonna spoil or talk (6:47 - 6:52)
about the Elite Four uh but I saved in (6:49 - 6:53)
front of the Elite Four to make sure (6:52 - 6:56)
that if the music was broken I could (6:53 - 6:58)
just reboot my game to make sure it (6:56 - 7:00)
would kick in properly (6:58 - 7:04)
now in this case uh while game freak (7:00 - 7:06)
Pokemon company Nintendo didn't say (7:04 - 7:08)
anything about any issues for the 12 (7:06 - 7:11)
days things were broken the (7:08 - 7:15)
person who wrote the Elite Four music on (7:11 - 7:17)
their Twitter their Japanese (7:15 - 7:20)
um composer they apologized that it (7:17 - 7:23)
wasn't working so we knew we knew that (7:20 - 7:24)
it wasn't working a hundred percent (7:23 - 7:26)
because the dude who wrote the song was (7:24 - 7:27)
like I'm so sorry you guys didn't hear (7:26 - 7:30)
my music which is a huge bummer (7:27 - 7:31)
um (7:30 - 7:33)
that that that song is very good for the (7:31 - 7:34)
record if I don't know if you guys got (7:33 - 7:36)
to delete four no spoilers but that song (7:34 - 7:40)
is fantastic I have not gotten I have so (7:36 - 7:41)
but I was not paying close enough (7:40 - 7:43)
attention I only heard about the bug (7:41 - 7:46)
after I had passed the Elite Four (7:43 - 7:48)
so I didn't I wasn't paying close enough (7:46 - 7:49)
attention to see if it was working or (7:48 - 7:51)
not because it was the same four notes (7:49 - 7:53)
over and over it just Blended in I (7:51 - 7:57)
probably would have noticed that okay (7:53 - 7:57)
um (7:57 - 8:01)
another thing I noticed again not in the (7:58 - 8:03)
patch notes is that uh I don't know if (8:01 - 8:05)
you guys noticed but when you got put to (8:03 - 8:08)
sleep in a battle your Pokemon's eyes (8:05 - 8:11)
did not close yeah they really uh I (8:08 - 8:12)
wouldn't even say they buried the league (8:11 - 8:13)
because they didn't mention it that is (8:12 - 8:15)
the biggest update absolutely when I (8:13 - 8:17)
first played we played the game and you (8:15 - 8:19)
know sleep powder and I was like why are (8:17 - 8:21)
their eyes still open like that's real (8:19 - 8:23)
creepy because they could close when you (8:21 - 8:25)
were picnicking or anytime they were out (8:23 - 8:27)
and they were going to sleep you could (8:25 - 8:29)
see that they could actually go to sleep (8:27 - 8:30)
and their eyes would close (8:29 - 8:33)
but not in battle Yeah (8:30 - 8:36)
yeah that has been fixed uh for the (8:33 - 8:37)
record gastrodon does not close their (8:36 - 8:39)
eyes they have three eyes I don't think (8:37 - 8:42)
gastrodon has eyelids so (8:39 - 8:45)
poor dastard on (8:42 - 8:45)
um so that has been fixed uh and then (8:45 - 8:51)
what was the other thing okay there was (8:48 - 8:53)
a duplication bug (8:51 - 8:58)
that has been fixed if you didn't (8:53 - 9:01)
duplicate your bike yeah so I don't know (8:58 - 9:04)
the the full details but pretty much if (9:01 - 9:06)
you duplicated your bike you can still (9:04 - 9:08)
duplicate items if you never duplicated (9:06 - 9:11)
your bike you cannot duplicate items (9:08 - 9:13)
anymore I don't know (9:11 - 9:16)
yeah I don't know if they'll they'll fix (9:13 - 9:18)
that and I (9:16 - 9:20)
I don't do that kind of stuff look look (9:18 - 9:22)
you paid your sixty dollars if you want (9:20 - 9:24)
to ride your bike up and down on (9:22 - 9:26)
Cinnabar Island and get missing no to (9:24 - 9:28)
appear by all means do it go do that now (9:26 - 9:31)
I grew out of that phase (9:28 - 9:33)
but hey if you want to duplicate your (9:31 - 9:35)
items and you did that I guess you can (9:33 - 9:38)
still do that I'd be curious if they (9:35 - 9:40)
fixed that but that was a I'm just (9:38 - 9:42)
bringing it up because they did you know (9:40 - 9:44)
out of the the things they fixed in the (9:42 - 9:46)
last 12 days that was a priority to them (9:44 - 9:49)
to make sure you could not duplicate (9:46 - 9:51)
your items anymore (9:49 - 9:53)
um kind of worked kind of worked was (9:51 - 9:56)
there also a Pokemon duplication problem (9:53 - 9:58)
that they fixed as well or is that (9:56 - 9:59)
something different (9:58 - 10:00)
um (9:59 - 10:03)
that I'm not sure of I've heard that you (10:00 - 10:05)
could duplicate Pokemon but you could (10:03 - 10:08)
also do that in bdsp and they fixed that (10:05 - 10:12)
pretty quickly got it got it I haven't (10:08 - 10:14)
tried any of that so I have no idea but (10:12 - 10:16)
the bike thing was surprisingly easy to (10:14 - 10:18)
run into (10:16 - 10:20)
I looked up how people were doing it and (10:18 - 10:22)
yeah it was something that if you were (10:20 - 10:24)
just sort of going along and catching (10:22 - 10:27)
Pokemon after getting to the point where (10:24 - 10:29)
you could get off the bike and use it in (10:27 - 10:30)
battle (10:29 - 10:33)
um surprisingly easy to run into (10:30 - 10:34)
yeah it seemed like if you were just (10:33 - 10:36)
pressing buttons really fast you could (10:34 - 10:39)
accidentally do it yeah (10:36 - 10:40)
or if you're pressing really buttons (10:39 - 10:41)
really fast in Pokemon go and you (10:40 - 10:43)
accidentally throw away 300 Ultra Balls (10:41 - 10:45)
I not that I may have accidentally did (10:43 - 10:47)
that yesterday (10:45 - 10:50)
because you went you hit left right you (10:47 - 10:52)
hit left left and I thought I was on (10:50 - 10:54)
potions because I was gonna yeah I did (10:52 - 10:56)
that with maybe 40 incense the day when (10:54 - 10:58)
all the golden Focus stops came out oh (10:56 - 11:01)
no it was I think I didn't even notice (10:58 - 11:03)
it worse at least Ultra boss you can (11:01 - 11:05)
spin to get back yeah incense are at (11:03 - 11:07)
least cheap and I rarely used them but (11:05 - 11:11)
it was not a fun moment to realize yeah (11:07 - 11:13)
I need those golden stops come back (11:11 - 11:15)
because that's how I stocked up on the (11:13 - 11:18)
Ultra Balls uh the other thing about (11:15 - 11:22)
this update was this quote that they (11:18 - 11:24)
said here we are aware that players (11:22 - 11:26)
encounter issues that affect games (11:24 - 11:27)
performance our goal has always been to (11:26 - 11:29)
give players a positive experience with (11:27 - 11:31)
our games we apologize for the (11:29 - 11:33)
inconvenience we take feedback from (11:31 - 11:35)
players seriously and we are working on (11:33 - 11:38)
improving uh we are working on (11:35 - 11:39)
improvements to the game (11:38 - 11:41)
so (11:39 - 11:42)
I don't know if there's any reading (11:41 - 11:44)
between the lines here but it sounds (11:42 - 11:46)
like (11:44 - 11:49)
we're gonna fix the frame rate (11:46 - 11:49)
sounds like it you know uh it is I guess (11:49 - 11:55)
what does it make sense that that's (11:54 - 11:58)
coming from Nintendo and not from the (11:55 - 12:00)
Pokemon company like (11:58 - 12:02)
um yes I think that makes sense from (12:00 - 12:03)
Nintendo because Nintendo's the (12:02 - 12:04)
publisher (12:03 - 12:07)
okay okay like like I I would I would (12:04 - 12:09)
say in this in the sake of in the sense (12:07 - 12:12)
of Bayonetta (12:09 - 12:14)
plat I'm pretty sure Platinum published (12:12 - 12:17)
or platinum developed Bayonetta if I (12:14 - 12:18)
remember correctly but Nintendo's the (12:17 - 12:19)
publisher (12:18 - 12:21)
so I think most people just see you know (12:19 - 12:24)
unless you're listening to a video game (12:21 - 12:27)
podcast like this (12:24 - 12:27)
you would probably know that Platinum is (12:27 - 12:31)
the publisher but if you're just walking (12:29 - 12:34)
in and you're like oh this is a Nintendo (12:31 - 12:36)
game because Nintendo's logo's on it you (12:34 - 12:38)
probably are like oh this is a Nintendo (12:36 - 12:40)
game right (12:38 - 12:40)
I feel like it's different for Pokemon (12:41 - 12:45)
but yeah (12:43 - 12:47)
but I mean either way I'm glad we're (12:45 - 12:51)
getting someone saying something to us (12:47 - 12:52)
about it because (12:51 - 12:56)
no one has it's like how can you I mean (12:52 - 12:58)
I get why they're not speaking about it (12:56 - 13:00)
why they weren't immediately saying (12:58 - 13:03)
anything but uh it's nice to have (13:00 - 13:06)
someone saying something so it feels (13:03 - 13:08)
like they are actually working on uh (13:06 - 13:10)
fixing it because we've seen too many (13:08 - 13:12)
times where Pokemon has had bugs or (13:10 - 13:15)
issues and they're just like eh yeah (13:12 - 13:17)
just just wait for the next game the (13:15 - 13:19)
next game will be better (13:17 - 13:21)
that's nice (13:19 - 13:23)
yeah no I think I think it's really (13:21 - 13:27)
reassuring I mean they they said that (13:23 - 13:28)
they got a lot of feedback they said (13:27 - 13:30)
they apologized for the inconvenience (13:28 - 13:32)
and they specifically said we are aware (13:30 - 13:36)
of game games performance we are working (13:32 - 13:38)
to improve the game (13:36 - 13:40)
um I I don't know if (13:38 - 13:43)
anyone listening thought like oh you (13:40 - 13:44)
just fixed the frame rate in two weeks (13:43 - 13:46)
all right good to go like it I don't (13:44 - 13:48)
think I don't think there's a slider at (13:46 - 13:50)
game freak that's like set at like 22 (13:48 - 13:52)
frames and like Nintendo's like hey can (13:50 - 13:54)
you just crank it up to like 30 please (13:52 - 13:58)
like it seems a bit of a more (13:54 - 14:01)
complicated issue and (13:58 - 14:01)
um (14:01 - 14:04)
they fixed some issues which is great I (14:01 - 14:06)
think there's also (14:04 - 14:08)
uh I at least got this from you know (14:06 - 14:10)
streaming on Twitch where people are (14:08 - 14:11)
like my game feels smoother and other (14:10 - 14:13)
people are like my game doesn't feel (14:11 - 14:15)
smoother and then you know there are (14:13 - 14:16)
gaming Outlets (14:15 - 14:18)
um that are saying the same thing some (14:16 - 14:19)
people are saying their games feel (14:18 - 14:21)
smoother some people are not I don't (14:19 - 14:24)
know if this is like a placebo or like I (14:21 - 14:26)
don't know what's happening there I I (14:24 - 14:30)
don't think it feels that much smoother (14:26 - 14:34)
but I don't know I'm in both camps oddly (14:30 - 14:36)
enough because when I play it on my TV (14:34 - 14:39)
and I haven't done I did the 720p thing (14:36 - 14:43)
before but I have a 4K OLED TV and so I (14:39 - 14:44)
was like okay I'm not this is I'm gonna (14:43 - 14:46)
go back to just the 1080P or whether the (14:44 - 14:48)
automatic whatever it is (14:46 - 14:50)
um on my TV it does not feel like it got (14:48 - 14:52)
any better on the switch OLED playing (14:50 - 14:54)
handheld it does feel like it got (14:52 - 14:57)
smoother so I'm not really sure if uh (14:54 - 15:00)
you know I it obviously did or didn't (14:57 - 15:03)
but uh I'm feeling two different ways (15:00 - 15:05)
about it so (15:03 - 15:07)
I don't know maybe people are also (15:05 - 15:08)
feeling that like some people are (15:07 - 15:11)
playing it on docked mode and it doesn't (15:08 - 15:13)
feel smoother (15:11 - 15:14)
some people aren't I don't know (15:13 - 15:17)
I've been under the impression that uh (15:14 - 15:18)
it was more to do with the memory Lake (15:17 - 15:21)
issue or potential issue that people are (15:18 - 15:23)
pretty sure about that when it updates (15:21 - 15:25)
and you actually have to fully close the (15:23 - 15:29)
game uh for it to update that after that (15:25 - 15:31)
then it's gonna run smoother because you (15:29 - 15:33)
had to close the game (15:31 - 15:36)
there you go I I could see that (15:33 - 15:38)
um I mean there are still I've still (15:36 - 15:39)
talked to people that are like my (15:38 - 15:40)
they're like my game has never crashed (15:39 - 15:43)
and I was like that my games crashed (15:40 - 15:44)
like four or five times and I'm not (15:43 - 15:49)
doing anything like yeah three of my (15:44 - 15:51)
crashes were just me like getting up (15:49 - 15:54)
going to the bathroom coming back down (15:51 - 15:56)
like talking with twitch chat and then (15:54 - 15:57)
finally picking up my controller after (15:56 - 15:59)
10 minutes and then opening the menu and (15:57 - 16:01)
then the whole game crashes like I (15:59 - 16:03)
literally just opened the menu after 10 (16:01 - 16:04)
minutes of like standing there so it's (16:03 - 16:05)
not like I'm (16:04 - 16:08)
you know yeah doing anything that (16:05 - 16:09)
happened to me as well (16:08 - 16:13)
um not streaming but I was playing I set (16:09 - 16:16)
my switch down to get something get a (16:13 - 16:18)
drink of food something I came back and (16:16 - 16:22)
tried to walk into a gym crashed like I (16:18 - 16:23)
just like took three steps forward into (16:22 - 16:26)
the gym crash like right after you know (16:23 - 16:28)
picking up the switch and so I've had (16:26 - 16:31)
two crashes two two crashes and I've (16:28 - 16:33)
only like 25 hours into the game so (16:31 - 16:37)
that's wild yeah I've played maybe 55 (16:33 - 16:40)
hours I have not had it crash I run into (16:37 - 16:42)
a couple of bugs where I couldn't do (16:40 - 16:45)
anything and I had to restart (16:42 - 16:49)
but I have not had it crash once (16:45 - 16:51)
lucky you (16:49 - 16:53)
maybe maybe it's because I never step (16:51 - 16:56)
away from my game (16:53 - 16:56)
just keep going (16:59 - 17:05)
um again I think I think the the first (17:02 - 17:08)
good patch not the maybe the patch (17:05 - 17:09)
everyone wanted but the whole like we (17:08 - 17:11)
take players feedback seriously when (17:09 - 17:15)
you're working to improve the game uh (17:11 - 17:18)
feels good I hope that that's the case I (17:15 - 17:20)
hope we get another update (17:18 - 17:22)
um (17:20 - 17:24)
yeah uh I guess we'll we'll see and (17:22 - 17:27)
we'll see how well it does for Christmas (17:24 - 17:28)
and whether (17:27 - 17:30)
you know (17:28 - 17:33)
it doesn't matter that it's broken to (17:30 - 17:34)
some people they're still gonna buy it I (17:33 - 17:35)
mean (17:34 - 17:38)
I feel like that's just (17:35 - 17:40)
a common theme in all video games of the (17:38 - 17:43)
last five years of like every Bethesda (17:40 - 17:45)
game is incredibly broken look at a game (17:43 - 17:47)
like cyberpunk incredibly broken look at (17:45 - 17:50)
how bad no man's Sky got reviewed and it (17:47 - 17:53)
still sold incredibly well like I feel (17:50 - 17:57)
like sometimes players think like oh (17:53 - 18:00)
bad reviews stop game sales and (17:57 - 18:03)
it yeah people are like I want this game (18:00 - 18:06)
they're like I don't trust the review I (18:03 - 18:07)
want I need to see it but that's how I (18:06 - 18:09)
was with no man's sky like I was in the (18:07 - 18:10)
store and Irene was like I really want (18:09 - 18:12)
no man's sky and I was like yeah it look (18:10 - 18:14)
it got so many bad reviews and she was (18:12 - 18:16)
like I want it and I was like (18:14 - 18:19)
all right here we go (18:16 - 18:19)
I mean I think with Pokemon it's like (18:20 - 18:24)
you have the fans right and you're (18:22 - 18:26)
they're gonna buy the game (18:24 - 18:28)
whether it's bad or not you know I mean (18:26 - 18:30)
you have people like us who obviously (18:28 - 18:32)
like I don't know I bought both of them (18:30 - 18:35)
like you know it's like so they got it (18:32 - 18:37)
twice for me and uh (18:35 - 18:41)
I think with the reviews and everything (18:37 - 18:43)
yeah I think it would definitely benefit (18:41 - 18:46)
them obviously to get this fixed or at (18:43 - 18:49)
least somewhat fixed before Christmas (18:46 - 18:51)
because (18:49 - 18:52)
you're gonna get it in the hands of a (18:51 - 18:55)
lot more people and then they're all (18:52 - 18:56)
going to be just as disappointed as we (18:55 - 18:59)
all were on November 18th we booted up (18:56 - 19:00)
the game (18:59 - 19:02)
um but I don't know that they'll be able (19:00 - 19:03)
to do that by what is that two weeks (19:02 - 19:06)
from now three weeks from now so I don't (19:03 - 19:08)
know but if they could incrementally (19:06 - 19:09)
make things better they don't need to (19:08 - 19:10)
like (19:09 - 19:12)
I think a lot of people will be okay (19:10 - 19:14)
knowing they're fixing things and if it (19:12 - 19:16)
doesn't all happen at the same time like (19:14 - 19:18)
I think people will be okay as long as (19:16 - 19:21)
they see progress uh or okay enough to (19:18 - 19:23)
be to to believe that they're gonna fix (19:21 - 19:25)
it overall but (19:23 - 19:27)
um I don't see that happening in the (19:25 - 19:30)
next couple weeks (19:27 - 19:30)
the announcement helps for believing (19:30 - 19:34)
that they will fix it (19:32 - 19:36)
but it's hard to see that happening (19:34 - 19:39)
before the holidays (19:36 - 19:42)
yeah I I would I I don't know how hard (19:39 - 19:46)
it is to develop a game I would assume (19:42 - 19:47)
that like (19:46 - 19:50)
making Pokemon's eyes go to sleep during (19:47 - 19:52)
a battle is is probably an easier update (19:50 - 19:55)
to push then (19:52 - 19:57)
trying to fix the frame rate of an open (19:55 - 19:59)
world game (19:57 - 20:02)
so I I don't I don't think that like (19:59 - 20:04)
they were like let's do all the easy (20:02 - 20:05)
stuff first and then work on the frame (20:04 - 20:07)
rate I'm sure it's been being worked on (20:05 - 20:09)
right like you just that's in a (20:07 - 20:10)
different (20:09 - 20:13)
patch that they're gonna push and it's (20:10 - 20:16)
just not ready yet so (20:13 - 20:16)
um (20:16 - 20:18)
okay so uh I think a common (20:18 - 20:25)
I think a common complaint in Pokemon (20:23 - 20:27)
games for the last couple of years is (20:25 - 20:31)
the lack of uh voice acting (20:27 - 20:33)
um (20:31 - 20:35)
and you know (20:33 - 20:37)
there are some people very adamant for (20:35 - 20:39)
voice acting there are some people that (20:37 - 20:42)
don't care about voice acting I I was a (20:39 - 20:44)
I think it's been said on this podcast I (20:42 - 20:46)
was a really big Destiny player and what (20:44 - 20:48)
always struck me to be really weird is (20:46 - 20:50)
in the destiny Community everyone was (20:48 - 20:52)
always mad that like your character (20:50 - 20:53)
didn't speak (20:52 - 20:56)
and everyone else in the game spoke and (20:53 - 20:58)
it like never bothered me because I was (20:56 - 21:02)
just like I I my character is me I'm (20:58 - 21:03)
just standing here just give me the (21:02 - 21:05)
information I'm gonna do the thing and (21:03 - 21:07)
then people got really excited when like (21:05 - 21:10)
your personal character finally spoke (21:07 - 21:12)
um and I think they had like one voice (21:10 - 21:13)
for it and I was like yeah I guess (21:12 - 21:15)
that's fine but people were adamant (21:13 - 21:19)
about it uh about that uh I think some (21:15 - 21:21)
people really liked (21:19 - 21:24)
that there was I think Zelda I'm pretty (21:21 - 21:25)
sure Zelda and a couple other characters (21:24 - 21:27)
in breath of the wild finally like spoke (21:25 - 21:30)
they had like voice V voice acting yes (21:27 - 21:34)
and I was like I just doesn't make the (21:30 - 21:36)
game any more enjoyable for me I I I (21:34 - 21:38)
totally get that some people like loved (21:36 - 21:40)
it or were really excited I just I just (21:38 - 21:42)
don't care all I'm saying is I'm in the (21:40 - 21:45)
camp that I personally don't really care (21:42 - 21:48)
um that much uh I do think during the (21:45 - 21:51)
peers thing and sword and shield I think (21:48 - 21:52)
that was the first point where I was (21:51 - 21:54)
like yeah this is really awkward because (21:52 - 21:57)
you you made a singer and I think the (21:54 - 21:59)
only reason it came off awkward is (21:57 - 22:00)
because I felt like they did it pretty (21:59 - 22:03)
okay in black black to white too like I (22:00 - 22:05)
think Roxy's gym (22:03 - 22:08)
felt better as a musical venue than (22:05 - 22:10)
Pierce's area (22:08 - 22:12)
maybe because like they there wasn't (22:10 - 22:14)
like voice acting but the song that they (22:12 - 22:16)
played like spelled out Pokemon (22:14 - 22:17)
I don't know if anyone remembers the (22:16 - 22:19)
song from black two white two (22:17 - 22:21)
maybe one of them (22:19 - 22:24)
[Laughter] (22:21 - 22:27)
but um (22:24 - 22:31)
uh this got Mis misquoted of course uh (22:27 - 22:33)
so I think the one of the things that (22:31 - 22:35)
drive me crazy with certain Pokemon fans (22:33 - 22:37)
are maybe they're not actually Pokemon (22:35 - 22:40)
fans is they they'll they'll crop (22:37 - 22:43)
certain like interviews to make it seem (22:40 - 22:44)
way worse than it is (22:43 - 22:47)
uh so the the crop here I'll read I'll (22:44 - 22:49)
read the crap this is from amore amore (22:47 - 22:51)
has been the game director for the last (22:49 - 22:53)
couple games uh pretty much Amore took (22:51 - 22:55)
charge when Masuda took a step back (22:53 - 22:57)
right we've talked about this before (22:55 - 23:02)
um uh so Amore's quote was but but the (22:57 - 23:07)
other reason is uh the other reason is (23:02 - 23:10)
one of the characters one (23:07 - 23:10)
here we go I get the quote right but the (23:11 - 23:16)
other reason is one of character image (23:13 - 23:19)
in the sense of when you play a game if (23:16 - 23:20)
you've got a voice on that character (23:19 - 23:24)
that instantly provides uh to the player (23:20 - 23:26)
an image a feel for that character that (23:24 - 23:28)
they don't generate themselves it's (23:26 - 23:31)
pushed on them from the development side (23:28 - 23:34)
whereas if we have a really if we have (23:31 - 23:36)
really flavorful text for those (23:34 - 23:38)
characters but no voice the players can (23:36 - 23:40)
create their own image of a character as (23:38 - 23:43)
they are playing it's something uh we'd (23:40 - 23:45)
really like to encourage as we were (23:43 - 23:46)
creating games (23:45 - 23:50)
so this is this this is uh part of the (23:46 - 23:53)
quote uh and the Tweet is like look it (23:50 - 23:56)
game freak's just lazy they want you to (23:53 - 23:58)
put the own voice in that's not the full (23:56 - 23:59)
quote I have the full code here (23:58 - 24:02)
[Laughter] (23:59 - 24:04)
but it's like why (24:02 - 24:07)
why are we just pushing that narrative (24:04 - 24:09)
right all right well that's weird that (24:07 - 24:12)
like any quote would start with the (24:09 - 24:14)
other reason like it's like wait a (24:12 - 24:15)
second there's clearly like you're (24:14 - 24:19)
missing half of what's going on here (24:15 - 24:20)
before you know when you're misquoting (24:19 - 24:22)
or not misquoting but like just taking (24:20 - 24:24)
out a context I guess which is I mean (24:22 - 24:25)
that's what the internet's for to take (24:24 - 24:28)
things out of context so uh you know (24:25 - 24:31)
checks out but I I imagine the full (24:28 - 24:34)
quote makes a whole different (24:31 - 24:37)
argument to this yeah and also just this (24:34 - 24:39)
this interview wasn't because of scarlet (24:37 - 24:40)
and violet this interview was a couple (24:39 - 24:42)
years ago but (24:40 - 24:45)
um that's important contest also (24:42 - 24:48)
important context right uh I don't think (24:45 - 24:50)
I don't think Amore has (24:48 - 24:54)
spoken recently about scarlet and violet (24:50 - 24:56)
um (24:54 - 24:58)
I don't think I think the last time (24:56 - 25:00)
Amore really spoke was around the time (24:58 - 25:02)
of sword and shield and then the (25:00 - 25:04)
national deck stuff I think kind of they (25:02 - 25:05)
kind of put a halt on the interviews (25:04 - 25:07)
there they were like yeah never mind we (25:05 - 25:09)
don't want to talk to you anymore (25:07 - 25:13)
uh so the whole quote is (25:09 - 25:13)
[Music] (25:13 - 25:15)
um (25:13 - 25:17)
uh Amore says there are sort of two main (25:15 - 25:19)
reasons so first this is an RPG with a (25:17 - 25:21)
lot of text and we're localizing it and (25:19 - 25:23)
then releasing it in nine different (25:21 - 25:25)
languages at the same time so from a (25:23 - 25:27)
purely practical point of view actually (25:25 - 25:29)
getting it organized and carrying out (25:27 - 25:31)
all the voice recordings the corrections (25:29 - 25:33)
and so on in nine different languages (25:31 - 25:35)
for release on the same exact day is (25:33 - 25:36)
something that would be incredibly (25:35 - 25:38)
difficult so it's one of the reasons we (25:36 - 25:40)
haven't chosen to do it and then the (25:38 - 25:42)
other reason is like the sense of when (25:40 - 25:44)
you play the game the voice of the (25:42 - 25:46)
character the quote I just said you're (25:44 - 25:48)
right (25:46 - 25:51)
um big piece of information that was (25:48 - 25:52)
left out (25:51 - 25:54)
of that that quote I mean that feels (25:52 - 25:56)
like (25:54 - 25:57)
I don't know I feel like if I saw that (25:56 - 25:59)
entire quote I would a little bit I'd be (25:57 - 26:01)
a little bit more like (25:59 - 26:03)
understanding of it because when you do (26:01 - 26:05)
read the second half it's kind of like (26:03 - 26:07)
they're just basically like use your (26:05 - 26:09)
imagination We're not gonna give you the (26:07 - 26:11)
full like this whole character uh (26:09 - 26:14)
logistical reasons yeah that first quote (26:11 - 26:15)
definitely (26:14 - 26:17)
makes it a little bit uh (26:15 - 26:19)
I don't know easier to understand or (26:17 - 26:22)
like to sympathize with I guess or (26:19 - 26:24)
empathize with yeah the second half of (26:22 - 26:26)
the quote you know these characters are (26:24 - 26:28)
going to be voiced in the anime in (26:26 - 26:30)
Pokemon Masters anyways (26:28 - 26:32)
but the first part the logistical part (26:30 - 26:34)
that at least adds more concrete (26:32 - 26:37)
reasoning (26:34 - 26:37)
yeah I there there's a lot of dialogue (26:37 - 26:42)
in Pokemon games uh and nine languages (26:40 - 26:44)
is a lot (26:42 - 26:47)
um I (26:44 - 26:47)
I don't know I think of like (26:48 - 26:53)
a triple a game like The Last of Us (26:50 - 26:56)
which has a lot of cutscenes and a lot (26:53 - 26:58)
of dialogue and (26:56 - 27:00)
I is I I don't know is that game (26:58 - 27:03)
localized nine different times I don't (27:00 - 27:06)
think so I mean obviously you can play (27:03 - 27:07)
the game in English (27:06 - 27:08)
I don't know if you can go in and switch (27:07 - 27:12)
it to Japanese and then (27:08 - 27:12)
I don't know (27:12 - 27:16)
I have no clue no idea I know (27:13 - 27:18)
so like you were saying earlier like (27:16 - 27:20)
Zelda breath of the Wild (27:18 - 27:21)
wasn't there I know people were (27:20 - 27:25)
speedrunning it in German because (27:21 - 27:27)
it would be the quickest for dialogue (27:25 - 27:29)
and for like the the voice stuff was and (27:27 - 27:30)
so I think that was in different (27:29 - 27:32)
languages I think the voice there was (27:30 - 27:34)
but there wasn't a lot of (27:32 - 27:36)
um voice acting in that game at all I (27:34 - 27:38)
remember correctly I think it was a (27:36 - 27:39)
little bit (27:38 - 27:42)
um yeah so I mean other games have done (27:39 - 27:45)
it but I just think I'm also not someone (27:42 - 27:47)
who really like needs the the voice (27:45 - 27:49)
acting though in a video game uh (27:47 - 27:51)
especially because (27:49 - 27:53)
it's kind of weird if they have your (27:51 - 27:56)
character voice acting when (27:53 - 27:57)
it's supposed to be you like you were (27:56 - 27:58)
saying like it's supposed to be you so (27:57 - 28:00)
how are they supposed to do that for the (27:58 - 28:02)
millions of people that pick up the game (28:00 - 28:05)
unless they're like hey you have like (28:02 - 28:06)
you know (28:05 - 28:08)
15 different options for voices and then (28:06 - 28:10)
that's just the whole that's then 15 (28:08 - 28:11)
times nine already right that's a whole (28:10 - 28:14)
different problem so yeah I'm never (28:11 - 28:16)
gonna happen I don't know I don't know (28:14 - 28:18)
if anyone was like I'm not buying (28:16 - 28:19)
Destiny because my character doesn't (28:18 - 28:21)
speak like (28:19 - 28:23)
I don't think that was like ever like (28:21 - 28:29)
and that that I I I'd be curious of like (28:23 - 28:29)
if they're trying to sell more copies (28:29 - 28:34)
and they're trying to prioritize like (28:31 - 28:38)
what what they can do new or or what (28:34 - 28:40)
would bring more people to the table I'm (28:38 - 28:42)
sure voice acting was talked about but (28:40 - 28:44)
it's like (28:42 - 28:44)
do they in the three years in these (28:45 - 28:50)
development Cycles which already seem (28:48 - 28:51)
pretty (28:50 - 28:54)
tight as as we can tell with scrawn (28:51 - 28:55)
pilot where you know things were missing (28:54 - 28:57)
and eyes weren't closing and frame rates (28:55 - 28:58)
bad (28:57 - 28:59)
um (28:58 - 29:01)
it doesn't even seem like if the even if (28:59 - 29:02)
they wanted to it didn't seem like they (29:01 - 29:04)
had time to (29:02 - 29:06)
right I don't think there's like five (29:04 - 29:08)
people sitting at game freak being like (29:06 - 29:10)
well we started the voice acting thing (29:08 - 29:12)
it's just like (29:10 - 29:13)
I don't think anyone over at game freaks (29:12 - 29:15)
just like being like well you know I was (29:13 - 29:17)
gonna do the voice acting thing and they (29:15 - 29:19)
didn't die I I reached out to some (29:17 - 29:21)
people we just didn't like just seems (29:20 - 29:24)
like everyone's busy doing other stuff (29:21 - 29:26)
um yeah again I'm not saying voice (29:24 - 29:28)
acting like I think I think would have (29:26 - 29:30)
benefited some instances of that game (29:28 - 29:32)
especially one of the gym leaders in (29:30 - 29:35)
scarlet and violet uh (29:32 - 29:38)
it didn't make or break it for for me (29:35 - 29:39)
um (29:38 - 29:41)
but (29:39 - 29:44)
I I totally see where people are coming (29:41 - 29:46)
from like I I've seen the like I'm going (29:44 - 29:49)
to be nimona's voice actor and I'm going (29:46 - 29:51)
to I've seen it on Tick Tock I've seen (29:49 - 29:54)
it on Twitter of like people who they're (29:51 - 29:55)
very serious about voice acting they use (29:54 - 29:58)
the Pokemon games uh and yeah they're (29:55 - 30:00)
they're very talented it's very good I (29:58 - 30:03)
totally understand but like (30:00 - 30:03)
um (30:03 - 30:07)
yeah it's not a big selling point for me (30:04 - 30:11)
right but when was that interview from (30:07 - 30:12)
two uh it was like shortly after let's (30:11 - 30:14)
go Pikachu let's go Eevee (30:12 - 30:18)
oh okay got it so after let's go but (30:14 - 30:20)
before certain Shield okay (30:18 - 30:22)
like four years ago then yeah yeah four (30:20 - 30:25)
years ago (30:22 - 30:25)
wow yeah that's I definitely thought (30:26 - 30:30)
that that was recent (30:28 - 30:32)
more reason than more recent than that (30:30 - 30:36)
but yeah is it Pokemon I know maybe (30:32 - 30:38)
Zelda there's like a game where you (30:36 - 30:42)
don't talk and they make they like (30:38 - 30:44)
they make a point of it they're like oh (30:42 - 30:46)
you're you're shy oh you never you never (30:44 - 30:48)
speak and I can't remember if that was (30:46 - 30:51)
in breath of the wild or did that in (30:48 - 30:52)
Destiny did they do the industry were (30:51 - 30:54)
they like they would be like oh not (30:53 - 30:58)
saying anything yeah for this yeah (30:54 - 31:00)
I always thought that was funny that's (30:58 - 31:02)
also kind of a characteristic of Link in (31:00 - 31:04)
at least most of the Zelda games okay (31:02 - 31:06)
yeah I thought it was the breath of the (31:04 - 31:08)
wild well enough (31:06 - 31:09)
I think it was in breath of the wild (31:08 - 31:12)
where they they keep like mentioning the (31:09 - 31:14)
fact that you don't speak throughout the (31:12 - 31:16)
entire game it's a running joke at this (31:14 - 31:19)
point right right yeah okay I know like (31:16 - 31:20)
Bravely Default I think your only (31:19 - 31:23)
language options were were your only (31:20 - 31:26)
Voice language options were um (31:23 - 31:28)
English and Japanese (31:26 - 31:30)
and I know I think that was the same for (31:28 - 31:33)
like Persona 5 where there's there's a (31:30 - 31:37)
there's a the anime crew of you know I (31:33 - 31:39)
only want to watch my anime in Japanese (31:37 - 31:41)
so they do that with their games as well (31:39 - 31:43)
they'll like switch (31:41 - 31:45)
um gosh I can't remember that dude's (31:43 - 31:47)
name from Persona 5. they wanna they (31:45 - 31:49)
wanna hear his voice in Japanese the (31:47 - 31:51)
entire time (31:49 - 31:51)
it's blanking on me (31:51 - 31:56)
I'll figure it out after the Break (31:54 - 31:57)
um (31:56 - 32:00)
yeah more so I wanted to bring up the (31:57 - 32:01)
voice acting because it was going around (32:00 - 32:04)
as like misinformation of like no (32:01 - 32:05)
they've they've addressed it before (32:04 - 32:08)
they've they said it's it's just a lot (32:05 - 32:10)
of work (32:08 - 32:10)
um and if I'm in in this situation if (32:10 - 32:14)
I'm picking between frame rate and voice (32:13 - 32:16)
acting I'm gonna pick frame rate myself (32:14 - 32:18)
but I could understand somebody being (32:16 - 32:20)
like ah voice acting is more important I (32:18 - 32:21)
get it (32:20 - 32:24)
uh I guess more important I don't know (32:21 - 32:26)
I'm sure there's someone out there I (32:24 - 32:28)
mean I'm sure there's someone out there (32:26 - 32:30)
I'm sure you'll get like tweets or (32:28 - 32:32)
something but I can't imagine like it (32:30 - 32:36)
just feels like performance should be uh (32:32 - 32:38)
the the top level there over over voice (32:36 - 32:41)
acting but that no that's just my just (32:38 - 32:43)
my opinion (32:41 - 32:45)
uh like I said like I said I I wouldn't (32:43 - 32:47)
be upset if they put it in if for me (32:45 - 32:51)
it's just not not a selling point (32:47 - 32:51)
um okay (32:51 - 32:54)
what are we at here for time cool (32:52 - 32:56)
exactly 30 minutes all right let's take (32:54 - 32:58)
a quick break when we come back uh I (32:56 - 33:00)
went to LA for the ultra Beast event (32:58 - 33:02)
we'll talk about that there's a new (33:00 - 33:04)
Keldeo event that people are upset about (33:02 - 33:07)
which is fair which is fair we've done (33:04 - 33:11)
this Eight dollar Dance Before uh so I (33:07 - 33:15)
we will be right back and we are back (33:11 - 33:18)
from our break uh uh some Pokemon Go (33:15 - 33:21)
stuff to to get through here uh all kind (33:18 - 33:24)
of a lot of Pokemon Go stuff I almost (33:21 - 33:26)
forgot about this we'll start off with (33:24 - 33:30)
this uh first which is the Pokemon go (33:26 - 33:33)
tour hoen (33:30 - 33:35)
uh which I think we all saw coming since (33:33 - 33:38)
they did Kanto and Chota (33:35 - 33:41)
clear patterns (33:38 - 33:42)
um (33:41 - 33:44)
and this will be the first time to get (33:42 - 33:46)
Shiny Jirachi (33:44 - 33:47)
there's like three people listening (33:46 - 33:49)
being like well you could actually get (33:47 - 33:52)
Shiny Jirachi and off the Gale of (33:49 - 33:55)
Darkness Coliseum kind yeah kinda I mean (33:52 - 33:58)
a little bit (33:55 - 34:00)
um there's a lot of RNG manipulation (33:58 - 34:02)
that needs to happen there for that to (34:00 - 34:04)
work but (34:02 - 34:07)
you do you uh no there was a Shiny (34:04 - 34:08)
Jirachi there's been two Shiny Jirachi (34:07 - 34:10)
events I think that were exclusive to (34:08 - 34:16)
Japan it was a Tana Bata Tana Bana (34:10 - 34:16)
because I knew that she knew what it was (34:19 - 34:24)
called (34:22 - 34:26)
perfect I mean I don't know I don't (34:24 - 34:27)
actually know if it's right I just know (34:26 - 34:31)
how to pronounce it yeah I believe they (34:27 - 34:32)
they do that Festival every single year (34:31 - 34:35)
but yeah two of those years they have (34:32 - 34:36)
given out (34:35 - 34:38)
um Shiny Jirachi and I think there might (34:36 - 34:40)
have been a Shiny Jirachi given out in (34:38 - 34:44)
Korea for a specific like opening for a (34:40 - 34:46)
store or something but this would be (34:44 - 34:49)
America's official and that's all that (34:46 - 34:50)
matters right everyone only cares about (34:49 - 34:52)
America this would be America's first (34:50 - 34:56)
Shiny Jirachi given well (34:52 - 34:59)
depends on what Niantic considers giving (34:56 - 35:02)
yeah Kevin is a is a Loosely used to (34:59 - 35:04)
there (35:02 - 35:08)
yeah so uh they are doing this in Vegas (35:04 - 35:12)
uh at Sunset Park which I have been told (35:08 - 35:16)
is actually a fantastic Park (35:12 - 35:18)
um it's it's it looks like it's (35:16 - 35:20)
south of the airport (35:18 - 35:23)
um and I think the the strip the the (35:20 - 35:25)
Vegas Strip is like Slightly North of (35:23 - 35:29)
the airport so if you were to wanting to (35:25 - 35:31)
avoid that it seems very possible to (35:29 - 35:34)
avoid that (35:31 - 35:34)
um hey Niantic listened I think uh you (35:35 - 35:40)
know I was you know I've said I've said (35:38 - 35:41)
that multiple times when I was in (35:40 - 35:43)
Germany or when I was in Seattle and (35:41 - 35:45)
people are like oh how are you playing (35:43 - 35:47)
for multiple days you know Niantic did (35:45 - 35:48)
give me we called it the super ticket (35:47 - 35:50)
Niantic gave me the super ticket so I (35:48 - 35:52)
could play every day (35:50 - 35:56)
um spoil maybe I I very privileged I (35:52 - 35:57)
understand (35:56 - 36:00)
the more Chinese whatever (35:57 - 36:01)
um the whole point of me playing (36:00 - 36:03)
multiple days was like to show people (36:01 - 36:05)
what they're missing right like it was a (36:03 - 36:07)
marketing play by Niantic they want they (36:05 - 36:09)
want people to see the event so then (36:07 - 36:11)
they go oh I want to go to that right (36:09 - 36:13)
um (36:11 - 36:16)
you know if playing eight hours of pogo (36:13 - 36:19)
every day in the sun walking with a (36:16 - 36:20)
backpack on (36:19 - 36:24)
isn't the the best way to play but (36:20 - 36:26)
um you know some people were like I want (36:24 - 36:28)
to play for multiple days I get it uh (36:26 - 36:29)
like um (36:28 - 36:32)
wanna somebody in the slack their name (36:29 - 36:35)
is steal she's really great she was like (36:32 - 36:36)
I would love to play multiple days just (36:35 - 36:38)
because I don't want to play the full (36:36 - 36:39)
day I just want to play a couple hours (36:38 - 36:41)
every day and I would pay for that (36:39 - 36:44)
experience totally understand right like (36:41 - 36:46)
not everyone wants to just do eight (36:44 - 36:49)
hours super hard on a Saturday (36:46 - 36:51)
some people might want to do like three (36:49 - 36:52)
hours take a two hour break do another (36:51 - 36:54)
three hours and then you know make up (36:52 - 36:56)
those two hours or whatever the next day (36:54 - 36:59)
I get it Niantic is providing you that (36:56 - 37:00)
option (36:59 - 37:03)
if you would like to pay for it (37:00 - 37:07)
so uh the the event is (37:03 - 37:10)
February 18th and 19th in Vegas from ten (37:07 - 37:13)
to six it's if you buy your ticket now (37:10 - 37:15)
it's 25 if you wait till after if you (37:13 - 37:19)
wait till January 1st it'll be 30 after (37:15 - 37:21)
that you get so for that 25 even though (37:19 - 37:23)
it says February 18th to 19th you are (37:21 - 37:26)
only picking one of those days it's not (37:23 - 37:30)
25 for both days it's 25 for one (37:26 - 37:31)
um (37:30 - 37:33)
you can add on (37:31 - 37:35)
another day (37:33 - 37:37)
for 25 dollars (37:35 - 37:39)
so if you would like to play the whole (37:37 - 37:40)
weekend (37:39 - 37:43)
which Niantic doesn't care you can give (37:40 - 37:45)
them 50 bucks (37:43 - 37:47)
totally up to you if that weekend is (37:45 - 37:49)
worth fifty dollars to you I know for a (37:47 - 37:51)
lot of Pokemon fans it is (37:49 - 37:54)
on top of that though (37:51 - 37:57)
do you love raids because Niantic would (37:54 - 38:01)
like to offer you a 15 add-on which will (37:57 - 38:04)
get you 18 raid passes 5 000 extra (38:01 - 38:07)
experience for each raid completed six (38:04 - 38:09)
additional candy for catching Pokemon (38:07 - 38:11)
and five star raids and three additional (38:09 - 38:14)
XL candy for catching Pokemon and five (38:11 - 38:15)
star raids (38:14 - 38:17)
um (38:15 - 38:17)
Bobby how do you feel about this deal (38:18 - 38:22)
would you are you are you a raid lover (38:20 - 38:25)
so I yeah I mean I laugh at this except (38:22 - 38:28)
I know that if I had that like I said (38:25 - 38:30)
before I can't go to Vegas this time (38:28 - 38:31)
because I'm gonna be somewhere else that (38:30 - 38:32)
weekend (38:31 - 38:34)
but if I could I would probably buy all (38:32 - 38:38)
of these things so it gets up to 80 or (38:34 - 38:41)
something like that well yeah it is (38:38 - 38:44)
there's a lot of other places in Vegas I (38:41 - 38:45)
could spend eighty dollars that would be (38:44 - 38:48)
a lot worse than Pokemon go so that's (38:45 - 38:50)
true that's true you know Hannah would (38:48 - 38:53)
you pay for the 15 raid lover (38:50 - 38:55)
I um (38:53 - 38:57)
I if I was there in person I probably (38:55 - 39:00)
would exactly I think that's (38:57 - 39:04)
I I think that going there in person 15 (39:00 - 39:08)
to enhance the experience enough is good (39:04 - 39:10)
I also like that there is a solid number (39:08 - 39:13)
on how many extra XL candy you get as (39:10 - 39:17)
opposed to this last event where you (39:13 - 39:19)
could pay for the five dollar ticket and (39:17 - 39:22)
it said you got extra Excel candy and (39:19 - 39:23)
yet (39:22 - 39:28)
yeah you know I I am one of those people (39:23 - 39:30)
I paid the five dollars for the Hoenn (39:28 - 39:33)
tour right okay so to be fair (39:30 - 39:35)
to be fair because I saw this on I saw (39:33 - 39:37)
this on Reddit I saw this on Twitter of (39:35 - 39:39)
people were like why would you pay for (39:37 - 39:41)
it you get five free rate passes who is (39:39 - 39:43)
doing more than five raids in the three (39:41 - 39:44)
hours (39:43 - 39:46)
and I (39:44 - 39:49)
me because I I can go to Mall of America (39:46 - 39:52)
and there are there are 10 to 12 gyms (39:49 - 39:55)
there and every hour those 10 to 12 gyms (39:52 - 39:57)
refresh like if I was to do all of them (39:55 - 40:01)
that would be like 30 raids so the five (39:57 - 40:03)
dollars was like worth it to me because (40:01 - 40:05)
it was cheaper than just buying six rate (40:03 - 40:08)
passes right and that made it but like (40:05 - 40:10)
yeah if you live in if you live in like (40:08 - 40:13)
a small town that has two gyms yeah (40:10 - 40:14)
you're only going to see six raids in (40:13 - 40:16)
the three hours like I get it but like (40:14 - 40:19)
for me it was it was worth it (40:16 - 40:21)
um I would buy the raid lover as well (40:19 - 40:24)
because if I'm pay if I'm playing (40:21 - 40:27)
eight hours just for one day I am (40:24 - 40:29)
probably gonna do 18 raids assuming that (40:27 - 40:31)
Sunset Park has a bunch of gyms which (40:29 - 40:33)
I'm sure it does (40:31 - 40:35)
um if people are if people are telling (40:33 - 40:36)
me that it's a great place to play I'm (40:35 - 40:38)
assuming it has a lot of gyms and well (40:36 - 40:41)
if they're giving you 18 free raid (40:38 - 40:43)
passes and then they don't have it like (40:41 - 40:44)
it's like you get there and there's one (40:43 - 40:47)
gym that you know I feel like that would (40:44 - 40:49)
not be a good look for niantics though (40:47 - 40:51)
right there must be some opportunity or (40:49 - 40:52)
they're gonna add stuff in for that (40:51 - 40:53)
weekend or something (40:52 - 40:58)
if you're an Enthusiast for 15 you can (40:53 - 41:01)
get one fourth the hatch distance three (40:58 - 41:03)
times the hatch XP three times the hatch (41:01 - 41:07)
candy three times the hatch Stardust and (41:03 - 41:09)
you get an increased chance of 10K eggs (41:07 - 41:13)
from spinning pokestops and photo discs (41:09 - 41:16)
Gotta Love It I gotta love it this one (41:13 - 41:20)
is a complete rip-off yeah (41:16 - 41:22)
but you do it anyway I wouldn't do this (41:20 - 41:24)
I don't know if I'd do this one (41:22 - 41:27)
I mean if Bobby is a sucker for (41:24 - 41:29)
incubators they're they're the biggest (41:27 - 41:32)
scam in Pogo they are the biggest scam (41:29 - 41:35)
in Pogo that is true and yet I still buy (41:32 - 41:37)
them when the events pop up where it's (41:35 - 41:41)
like oh less distance to hatch of course (41:37 - 41:43)
I need to buy some incubator (41:41 - 41:46)
sometimes I do sometimes I don't I did (41:43 - 41:50)
recently for the whole Noibat thing uh I (41:46 - 41:51)
wanted a shiny Noibat I didn't get one I (41:50 - 41:54)
got a bunch of non-shiny Noibat (41:51 - 41:59)
um yep but sometimes especially (41:54 - 41:59)
sometimes when they're when there's (42:00 - 42:05)
lowered uh hatch distance (42:02 - 42:07)
I will just walk a whole bunch with my (42:05 - 42:10)
one free incubator and get as much as I (42:07 - 42:11)
can out of that I don't know if I would (42:10 - 42:13)
pay for something to just do that (42:11 - 42:14)
because you really have to add the (42:13 - 42:18)
incubators to make it worth it right if (42:14 - 42:21)
the egg Enthusiast came with like even (42:18 - 42:24)
if it came with like three incubators I (42:21 - 42:25)
feel like it would be a slightly better (42:24 - 42:29)
deal but like I I don't know who who (42:25 - 42:31)
there's always one person out there I (42:29 - 42:33)
know I know but I don't know who is (42:31 - 42:35)
buying the egg Enthusiast but not buying (42:33 - 42:38)
incubators because it feels like if if (42:35 - 42:39)
you're just using your free incubator (42:38 - 42:41)
and then you're paying 15 I feel like (42:39 - 42:43)
you're literally throwing away money (42:41 - 42:45)
yeah because you're just catching enough (42:43 - 42:47)
I definitely missed the fact here I'm (42:45 - 42:48)
looking at the just on the website like (42:47 - 42:50)
I definitely miss the fact that they're (42:48 - 42:51)
they're not giving you any incubators (42:50 - 42:55)
for this yeah no they're not (42:51 - 43:00)
that's awful and I'd still do it (42:55 - 43:00)
I maybe I'm wrong but I feel like (43:02 - 43:07)
more people than not would rather just (43:05 - 43:11)
take 15 give me some incubators and then (43:07 - 43:14)
like remove the like hatch candy or (43:11 - 43:15)
remove the Stardust like (43:14 - 43:17)
I feel like if you're a hatch Enthusiast (43:15 - 43:21)
or an egg Enthusiast you would want (43:17 - 43:24)
to hatch as many as possible and this is (43:21 - 43:27)
literally just giving you bonuses like (43:24 - 43:28)
you're still required to buy the (43:27 - 43:32)
incubators the correct term Steve is egg (43:28 - 43:37)
enthusiasts egg mistake how dare how (43:32 - 43:40)
dare okay so if you if you if you want (43:37 - 43:42)
to play both days you do the early bird (43:40 - 43:45)
you're saving five dollars 25 you add on (43:42 - 43:47)
the second day another 25. you add on (43:45 - 43:50)
both of these you are looking at eighty (43:47 - 43:54)
dollars in Pogo for the weekend (43:50 - 43:56)
um and that is not extra rate passes (43:54 - 43:58)
that is not star pieces that is not (43:56 - 44:00)
lucky eggs that is that is that's most (43:58 - 44:03)
likely just gen 3. also if you think (44:00 - 44:04)
about that right because it's the Hoenn (44:03 - 44:07)
tour so you're paying eighty dollars for (44:04 - 44:12)
Owen and probably not all of it and (44:07 - 44:15)
uh yeah you're looking for yeah probably (44:12 - 44:18)
not so do we do we think they're gonna (44:15 - 44:20)
do keckley on here no I am pretty (44:18 - 44:22)
certain there was a part of the website (44:20 - 44:24)
that said something along the lines of (44:22 - 44:26)
catch all of the Pokemon in Hoenn and (44:24 - 44:29)
then they've changed it to most to most (44:26 - 44:31)
yeah (44:29 - 44:34)
yep I am pretty convinced kecleon is not (44:31 - 44:37)
coming yeah which is a shame because I (44:34 - 44:38)
was I was kind of relying on that (44:37 - 44:40)
Platinum metal (44:38 - 44:44)
same for for the level up yeah yeah (44:40 - 44:44)
um (44:44 - 44:47)
I think this is a cool way to do Primal (44:44 - 44:49)
Groudon and Kyogre I think them debuting (44:47 - 44:52)
at this event is like really uh makes it (44:49 - 44:53)
feel like a little bit more special (44:52 - 44:55)
instead of just like dropping them (44:53 - 44:58)
uh out of nowhere I think that's like (44:55 - 45:01)
good timing also to have those those pop (44:58 - 45:04)
up there there is a worldwide I keep the (45:01 - 45:09)
the the go tour dot Pokemon go live it's (45:04 - 45:12)
such a hard website to navigate I I (45:09 - 45:14)
should have pinned the page okay there (45:12 - 45:17)
is a global tour which was very (45:14 - 45:19)
confusing because they're like (45:17 - 45:21)
confusing in the sense that the Kanto (45:19 - 45:23)
tour and the Johto tour took place (45:21 - 45:27)
during the pandemic right and so there (45:23 - 45:30)
wasn't ever an option of a a location to (45:27 - 45:32)
actually go to I think the Johto tour (45:30 - 45:35)
had a location in Mexico it was the next (45:32 - 45:37)
day though it was like only on Sunday (45:35 - 45:41)
and it was in uh Monterey right yeah (45:37 - 45:44)
Prairie for the American people (45:41 - 45:46)
and uh it was supposed to be in three (45:44 - 45:49)
locations but I believe oh yeah two of (45:46 - 45:51)
the locations canceled it because of the (45:49 - 45:53)
because of coveted restrictions yes yes (45:51 - 45:55)
I think you're right but I think you're (45:53 - 45:57)
only Sunday and it wasn't (45:55 - 45:59)
it was like it was Sunday and it was (45:57 - 46:01)
Kanto wasn't it like it was during the (45:59 - 46:02)
Johto tour but the whole point of it was (46:01 - 46:05)
because you're going back to Kanto like (46:02 - 46:07)
you didn't oh right right right right (46:05 - 46:08)
right right yeah there was there was (46:07 - 46:11)
some thought put in it just yeah there (46:08 - 46:12)
was something there there was something (46:11 - 46:14)
there was something there this is an (46:12 - 46:16)
improvement but there was you know this (46:14 - 46:18)
was the I like the idea so the Pokemon (46:16 - 46:22)
go tour hoen Global is a global event (46:18 - 46:24)
that will happen on Saturday (46:22 - 46:28)
the 25th to Sunday the 26th ten to six (46:24 - 46:31)
and from what Niantic told me (46:28 - 46:33)
that that's free (46:31 - 46:36)
that you can just do it which which is (46:33 - 46:39)
the same for the Kanto and the Johto it (46:36 - 46:42)
was free but you were very limited in (46:39 - 46:44)
what you could do in the the free right (46:42 - 46:47)
like you I could show up at the Mall of (46:44 - 46:49)
America for the Kanto tour and I could (46:47 - 46:53)
do Tauros and Kangaskhan and Farfetch'd (46:49 - 46:54)
like I could just do they can't stop me (46:53 - 46:56)
from doing those they're not gonna stop (46:54 - 46:58)
me for giving them dollars to do (46:56 - 46:59)
farfetch (46:58 - 47:00)
um (46:59 - 47:03)
but I the things you couldn't do like (47:00 - 47:06)
you couldn't get (47:03 - 47:06)
you didn't have the request line of like (47:06 - 47:10)
collecting them all which then would (47:08 - 47:12)
have gave you more stuff like well yeah (47:10 - 47:15)
I think it led to Shiny Mew back in the (47:12 - 47:17)
Kanto tour yes yeah the Masterwork (47:15 - 47:20)
research is always paid yeah yeah and (47:17 - 47:22)
also there was like the increased shiny (47:20 - 47:23)
chance (47:22 - 47:25)
I think that was a thing in decanto tour (47:23 - 47:28)
as well if you paid I don't think that (47:25 - 47:29)
was free (47:28 - 47:32)
yes I think the increased Johnny chance (47:29 - 47:35)
or what like it was you paid but also (47:32 - 47:37)
you had to turn on an incense and the (47:35 - 47:39)
incense would give you specific Pokemon (47:37 - 47:42)
that free people didn't see yep that as (47:39 - 47:44)
well was that for the account yeah I (47:42 - 47:46)
don't know if that was for a tour I (47:44 - 47:48)
think that was just for go fest last (47:46 - 47:48)
year (47:48 - 47:50)
wow (47:48 - 47:54)
I think you'd only get like fan P off an (47:50 - 47:56)
incense during the Johto tour like he (47:54 - 47:58)
like fan P wouldn't spawn in the wild (47:56 - 48:01)
and then the other fan P was like so (47:58 - 48:03)
gold and then like the other one there (48:01 - 48:05)
were the version exclusives yeah yeah (48:03 - 48:07)
yeah (48:05 - 48:07)
uh which I haven't talked about version (48:07 - 48:10)
exclusive here but to be fair the (48:08 - 48:12)
event's like 90 days away so I'm sure (48:10 - 48:15)
there'll be more details uh but your (48:12 - 48:19)
selling points are Shiny Jirachi uh new (48:15 - 48:25)
Ultra Wormhole re whatever uh primals uh (48:19 - 48:26)
Pokemon that couldn't be shiny cannot be (48:25 - 48:29)
shiny like I think Gulpin is one of the (48:26 - 48:30)
ones that can't be shiny but will be (48:29 - 48:34)
shiny relicanth would be another one (48:30 - 48:37)
um gorilla camps training is so good (48:34 - 48:37)
uh and they say new features and items (48:38 - 48:42)
check back soon for more info yeah so (48:40 - 48:43)
they're they're not done selling this (48:42 - 48:46)
although like look if you're looking I (48:43 - 48:47)
don't if you're looking at this you're (48:46 - 48:49)
probably you've probably made your (48:47 - 48:50)
decision of like I'm going to Vegas or (48:49 - 48:53)
I'm not right I think (48:50 - 48:53)
like I don't know what else Niantic has (48:54 - 48:57)
to do to convince you to go to Vegas (48:56 - 48:59)
either you're you're gonna go to Vegas (48:57 - 49:00)
or you're just gonna wait for the the (48:59 - 49:02)
next weekend where the event is global (49:00 - 49:04)
so (49:02 - 49:07)
um I'm gonna try to go uh I I personally (49:04 - 49:09)
like in-person Pogo events I I think (49:07 - 49:11)
they're really great (49:09 - 49:13)
um at least for me Vegas is I think a (49:11 - 49:15)
pretty cheap I think for most people the (49:13 - 49:16)
United States Vegas is a pretty cheap (49:15 - 49:18)
flight because they want you to go to (49:16 - 49:21)
Vegas absolutely they get you with the (49:18 - 49:25)
other things in Vegas so (49:21 - 49:25)
we'll see how that works out (49:26 - 49:31)
speaking of going places uh I will full (49:28 - 49:33)
disclosure nine tick paid for my flight (49:31 - 49:35)
and my hotel to go out to LA for the (49:33 - 49:38)
ultra Beast event (49:35 - 49:40)
um I know there was complaints of like (49:38 - 49:42)
why was this event planned on (49:40 - 49:45)
Thanksgiving weekend I just want to (49:42 - 49:47)
remind people that Pokemon go is a (49:45 - 49:50)
worldwide game and one country (49:47 - 49:52)
celebrating a holiday doesn't mean all (49:50 - 49:55)
the countries are celebrating a holiday (49:52 - 49:57)
um but they had an event in London and (49:55 - 49:59)
they had an event in LA (49:57 - 50:01)
and (49:59 - 50:03)
it was good it was okay I think if you (50:01 - 50:05)
were this what I would say is it was a (50:03 - 50:08)
hundred percent not worth traveling to (50:05 - 50:11)
uh like not worth the the hotel and the (50:08 - 50:13)
flight but if you were in the area it (50:11 - 50:15)
was a free event (50:13 - 50:16)
um I don't think Niantic released (50:15 - 50:19)
numbers but from what one of the (50:16 - 50:22)
security guards said so the real Source (50:19 - 50:25)
the real source that that when they have (50:22 - 50:29)
events in the it was the Ovation I think (50:25 - 50:31)
um they said the the capacity for the (50:29 - 50:33)
Ovation is 4 000 people (50:31 - 50:37)
and they they were turning away people (50:33 - 50:39)
um at a certain point it seemed like if (50:37 - 50:41)
you got there at (50:39 - 50:43)
I think the event started at (50:41 - 50:44)
seven (50:43 - 50:47)
yeah and they started handing out (50:44 - 50:49)
tickets at six and I think as long as (50:47 - 50:50)
you were (50:49 - 50:52)
you were there at six you got a ticket (50:50 - 50:56)
like they it didn't seem like people (50:52 - 50:58)
were away now I heard different reports (50:56 - 51:01)
in London I heard that like so many (50:58 - 51:02)
people and then got turned away and I (51:01 - 51:04)
can't speak to that I wasn't there I can (51:02 - 51:06)
only just read what I've read online but (51:04 - 51:09)
it seemed like in LA if you wanted to go (51:06 - 51:11)
to it and you showed up right at six (51:09 - 51:13)
they get a ticket you got a ticket (51:11 - 51:16)
um I mean Thanksgiving right yeah yeah (51:13 - 51:19)
that makes it happen in London yeah (51:16 - 51:21)
right that that makes more sense (51:19 - 51:22)
um (51:21 - 51:25)
tickets for free uh there were they had (51:22 - 51:26)
two counters they had like a North (51:25 - 51:28)
counter and a South counter because the (51:26 - 51:29)
Ovation had multiple ways to get into it (51:28 - 51:31)
you just stood in line they gave you a (51:29 - 51:32)
little wristband and they gave you a (51:31 - 51:34)
postcard on the postcard was a QR code (51:32 - 51:36)
scanning that QR code gave you an (51:34 - 51:38)
in-game medal and then it showed that it (51:36 - 51:41)
unlocked the gyms you could see the gyms (51:38 - 51:42)
um that were happening and then there (51:41 - 51:45)
was a little quest line uh that started (51:42 - 51:49)
before the ultra Beast thing where it (51:45 - 51:52)
was like catch a Pokemon that um Katana (51:49 - 51:54)
is weak against and then you did that (51:52 - 51:56)
you would get a Pokemon and like catch a (51:54 - 51:57)
Pokemon and sell a Steelers week again (51:56 - 51:59)
so that was kind of like it was it was (51:57 - 52:01)
it was a cute (51:59 - 52:03)
um and then at the end of that you got (52:01 - 52:05)
like a free rate pass (52:03 - 52:07)
um I don't know if the ticket (52:05 - 52:09)
I don't know if you scanning the ticket (52:07 - 52:11)
gave you free raid passes I'm unsure of (52:09 - 52:13)
fat because Niantic personally gave me (52:11 - 52:15)
like 10 free raid passes or something (52:13 - 52:17)
before the event started (52:15 - 52:19)
um which they they do time to time (52:17 - 52:20)
they're like we want you to make content (52:19 - 52:23)
so here's a one okay okay thanks (52:20 - 52:25)
um (52:23 - 52:27)
I would have bought them anyways I guess (52:25 - 52:28)
uh (52:27 - 52:31)
so the event was pretty straightforward (52:28 - 52:32)
they (52:31 - 52:34)
uh right at seven o'clock they had this (52:32 - 52:36)
huge countdown (52:34 - 52:38)
um nyligo came out of the ultra Wormhole (52:36 - 52:40)
they had this projection of like the (52:38 - 52:42)
ultra wormhole on the (52:40 - 52:44)
wall (52:42 - 52:46)
um and what was really cool is they (52:44 - 52:48)
actually had the (52:46 - 52:51)
Ultra Beast music to the ultra Beast so (52:48 - 52:52)
they had Nile egos music they had (52:51 - 52:54)
buzzwell's music they had cortana's (52:52 - 52:57)
music and it was nice I was very yeah I (52:54 - 52:58)
was very worried it was just going to be (52:57 - 53:01)
like the standard like Canto Route One (52:58 - 53:04)
music the entire time but it was (53:01 - 53:07)
actually the Sun and Moon music for the (53:04 - 53:09)
ultra Beast (53:07 - 53:12)
um and yeah so each Ultra Beast lasts (53:09 - 53:14)
about 10 minutes uh lobbies filled (53:12 - 53:16)
instantly obviously there was in a (53:14 - 53:18)
single Lobby where I wasn't level 20 in (53:16 - 53:21)
there were so many players though and I (53:18 - 53:23)
think this I think this just kind of (53:21 - 53:25)
goes to show for maybe the hardcore (53:23 - 53:26)
people that think everyone plays this (53:25 - 53:28)
game and everyone's level 40 and (53:26 - 53:30)
everyone has all these Pokemon or care (53:28 - 53:32)
they're just (53:30 - 53:34)
an overwhelming amount of people and all (53:32 - 53:36)
the raids I went that were like level 22 (53:34 - 53:41)
23. like it was very rare to see like a (53:36 - 53:43)
level 40. (53:41 - 53:44)
um I mean you saw some level 50s (53:43 - 53:46)
obviously the hardcore people that (53:44 - 53:48)
probably drove three hours to get there (53:46 - 53:52)
to like play but just so many under (53:48 - 53:55)
level 40 people (53:52 - 53:55)
um (53:55 - 53:58)
uh to be fair some of them did Mega so I (53:55 - 53:59)
was like oh yeah I brought your mega (53:58 - 54:02)
great get that extra candy you do you uh (53:59 - 54:04)
but yeah I think I think (54:02 - 54:06)
just to take a step back I think we we (54:04 - 54:07)
you know (54:06 - 54:10)
we just talked about the the Hoenn tour (54:07 - 54:14)
and for some people pogo is like (54:10 - 54:16)
a once a weekend kind of game where they (54:14 - 54:18)
they boot it up they they play for a (54:16 - 54:20)
little bit and they're very happy and (54:18 - 54:21)
then you know they wait till the next (54:20 - 54:23)
event and not every event applies to (54:21 - 54:24)
everyone (54:23 - 54:25)
um (54:24 - 54:28)
but Niantic at least did a good job I (54:25 - 54:30)
posted on like social media they had (54:28 - 54:32)
like uh people carrying like Ultra Beast (54:30 - 54:35)
or coming like you know end is near and (54:32 - 54:38)
they were paying these people to like uh (54:35 - 54:40)
and it was really great because one of (54:38 - 54:42)
the one of the ladies she deserves all (54:40 - 54:44)
she I hopefully Niantic paid her really (54:42 - 54:46)
well but you know she shout at you that (54:44 - 54:48)
Ultra beasts are coming and like the (54:46 - 54:49)
world is ending and stuff and then (54:48 - 54:51)
people would like stop and listen and (54:49 - 54:53)
then they would be like it should be (54:51 - 54:54)
like right up there right up there this (54:53 - 54:56)
way this way to the ultra beast and then (54:54 - 54:58)
she'd be like (54:56 - 54:58)
[Laughter] (54:59 - 55:05)
in character and then like as soon as (55:03 - 55:07)
she was done doing her page she would be (55:05 - 55:09)
like hey it starts in like 15 minutes (55:07 - 55:10)
it's totally free like enjoy yourself (55:09 - 55:13)
and like she would push and they did a (55:10 - 55:15)
really good job at like you know selling (55:13 - 55:17)
out the free event (55:15 - 55:18)
um and it seemed like when I was there (55:17 - 55:20)
everyone had a great time (55:18 - 55:22)
um the ending was a little lackluster (55:20 - 55:23)
the final Pokemon that came out with (55:22 - 55:25)
celestila which everyone cheered again I (55:23 - 55:27)
think it goes like (55:25 - 55:29)
you know if you were using Pokey Genie (55:27 - 55:32)
or whatever those apps are to like you (55:29 - 55:35)
know get the southern hemisphere Pokemon (55:32 - 55:38)
you already have celestila but like (55:35 - 55:41)
people cheered really loud for celestila (55:38 - 55:43)
because it's not normally in the (55:41 - 55:45)
northern hemisphere like they were very (55:43 - 55:47)
excited to get it I mean myself included (55:45 - 55:48)
I was like I didn't have time to do that (55:47 - 55:50)
I was I was traveling so I'm like I (55:48 - 55:51)
absolutely now (55:50 - 55:53)
um but yeah it was it was uh it was a (55:51 - 55:54)
good event (55:53 - 55:57)
um and so I I hope that Niantic does (55:54 - 55:59)
like more of that kind of stuff which is (55:57 - 56:01)
just like (55:59 - 56:04)
pick a city totally free if you missed (56:01 - 56:06)
it it's not the end of the world but (56:04 - 56:08)
it's nice for the people that are there (56:06 - 56:09)
locally (56:08 - 56:11)
um or you know I would have I would have (56:09 - 56:12)
probably you know if you were an hour or (56:11 - 56:13)
two away I think it was worth driving (56:12 - 56:16)
too I mean I was I am two hours away (56:13 - 56:20)
from Los Angeles and but that's like I'm (56:16 - 56:21)
two hours away if there's no traffic and (56:20 - 56:23)
there's never no traffic in L.A so it (56:21 - 56:26)
was going to city that yeah it would (56:23 - 56:28)
have been three or four hours I think (56:26 - 56:32)
both ways uh to get there and it was (56:28 - 56:34)
also the two days after Thanksgiving so (56:32 - 56:36)
it was just you know was not going to (56:34 - 56:38)
work but if it was really any other (56:36 - 56:39)
weekend I probably would have just (56:38 - 56:41)
driven up there to do it uh but yeah (56:39 - 56:42)
just (56:41 - 56:44)
not the best timing or like it doesn't (56:42 - 56:46)
even it's not even that it was on (56:44 - 56:48)
Thanksgiving weekend but if there was (56:46 - 56:50)
more time to prepare for that it would (56:48 - 56:52)
have been so had they told us about it (56:50 - 56:53)
like (56:52 - 56:55)
a month before you know or just a little (56:53 - 56:57)
bit of time before to be like oh there's (56:55 - 56:59)
this event like a live in-person event (56:57 - 57:01)
happening in Los Angeles (56:59 - 57:03)
it'd have been like oh okay well I can (57:01 - 57:05)
maybe change some things around since (57:03 - 57:06)
we're like a month out but it was what (57:05 - 57:09)
two weeks maybe a week I think they gave (57:06 - 57:11)
people like a week's heads up which I (57:09 - 57:13)
don't know if that was like intentional (57:11 - 57:14)
because they knew they couldn't hold (57:13 - 57:16)
that many people maybe yeah I mean (57:14 - 57:18)
that's that's fine if we give like three (57:16 - 57:20)
weeks then then people are gonna plan (57:18 - 57:23)
and book hotels and yeah I I'm not 100 (57:20 - 57:26)
sure on on that I guess that's true (57:23 - 57:27)
maybe they didn't want like and also (57:26 - 57:29)
flights would have been super I would (57:27 - 57:30)
imagine flights would be expensive just (57:29 - 57:33)
because of that time like (57:30 - 57:35)
Thanksgiving time frame and so maybe (57:33 - 57:37)
they're like we don't want people to (57:35 - 57:38)
like (57:37 - 57:40)
make a bunch of plans to fly out here (57:38 - 57:41)
and stuff for this or something like (57:40 - 57:43)
that so we'll just make it you know (57:41 - 57:44)
sooner and then people won't like have (57:43 - 57:47)
as much chance to do that well I flew (57:44 - 57:48)
out on Black Friday (57:47 - 57:51)
um and the airport was dead (57:48 - 57:53)
completely dead and then when I flew (57:51 - 57:55)
back on Sunday at the airport was (57:53 - 57:58)
busting which makes sense right like I (57:55 - 58:00)
don't think a lot of people are flying (57:58 - 58:01)
out the day after Thanksgiving I think (58:00 - 58:02)
most people are coming in and they're (58:01 - 58:04)
spending the weekend and then they're (58:02 - 58:06)
flying out on Sunday so but like yeah (58:04 - 58:08)
Black Friday I've never seen the airport (58:06 - 58:10)
that did it was It was kind of nice (58:08 - 58:13)
honestly yeah that sounds kind of nice (58:10 - 58:15)
foreign (58:13 - 58:15)
but that was like the Twin City airport (58:16 - 58:21)
when I got into LAX like that I I'm I (58:18 - 58:23)
don't think that Airport's never not (58:21 - 58:29)
dead yeah yeah it's a weird airport too (58:23 - 58:30)
um (58:29 - 58:34)
what is our final bit of news here is (58:30 - 58:39)
oh the the Keldeo event yeah keep sharp (58:34 - 58:43)

getting 14 rare candy (60:09 - 60:14)
look I talked to Niantic employees all (60:12 - 60:17)
the time I don't know who is over there (60:14 - 60:19)
deciding exactly how much for a candy (60:17 - 60:22)
somebody should be getting for a a price (60:19 - 60:25)

quite excited about corvaller debuting (61:03 - 61:09)
time (61:06 - 61:12)
and they're giving uh they're giving (61:09 - 61:13)

trackion and Verizon (61:13 - 61:18)
uh special new moves right they're (61:15 - 61:20)
giving them (61:18 - 61:22)
oh it says featured attack I don't think (61:20 - 61:24)
they're oh sacred sort sacred sword yeah (61:22 - 61:26)
scroll down (61:24 - 61:26)
um and there will be a collection (61:27 - 61:31)
challenge to do uh so that's that's the (61:28 - 61:32)
event so it seems like you're you can (61:31 - 61:35)
buy the event on Tuesday but you have to (61:32 - 61:37)
log in on Saturday or Sunday to like (61:35 - 61:39)
start the Keldeo quest line this was (61:37 - 61:41)
Victini all over again right wasn't that (61:39 - 61:44)
a Victini thing as well that was any (61:41 - 61:47)
yeah that was the go Fest because things (61:44 - 61:49)
didn't well didn't open up his app or (61:47 - 61:52)
something and Miss because will was at a (61:49 - 61:54)
wedding so he bought the go he bought (61:52 - 61:55)
the go Fest ticket he was at a wedding (61:54 - 61:57)
he didn't open his app therefore he (61:55 - 62:01)
never got Victini yeah I this might be I (61:57 - 62:02)
don't think this is the first time they (62:01 - 62:03)
said you need to open your app in order (62:02 - 62:04)
to get the thing this might be the (62:03 - 62:06)
second or third time but like it's (62:04 - 62:08)
always I think Celebi was like that as (62:06 - 62:09)
well spiritunes been like that in the (62:08 - 62:13)
past for Halloween stuff like uh (62:09 - 62:15)
yeah you have to open it to start to (62:13 - 62:18)
like kick off the the research which is (62:15 - 62:20)
a really weird whatever they're doing (62:18 - 62:22)
there to make it so that (62:20 - 62:24)
they open something up and then they (62:22 - 62:25)
must close it but it's just weird to (62:24 - 62:27)
spend money and then (62:25 - 62:29)
I guess it makes sense right if you (62:27 - 62:30)
spend money on a movie and you don't go (62:29 - 62:31)
to see the movie when the movie starts (62:30 - 62:33)
you're gonna miss the movie yeah I get (62:31 - 62:35)
it but it's just I don't yeah that logic (62:33 - 62:37)
is good I mean (62:35 - 62:39)
he's just like (62:37 - 62:41)
yeah I mean you buy a battle pass in (62:39 - 62:43)
fortnite and then you decide not to play (62:41 - 62:44)
it (62:43 - 62:47)
you don't get it it just it doesn't make (62:44 - 62:48)
it any better right you gave them the (62:47 - 62:50)
money it just (62:48 - 62:52)
does kind of suck here's the question (62:50 - 62:54)
that I have though Hannah did you buy (62:52 - 62:57)
the 7.99 Mr mime event (62:54 - 63:00)
I did not I definitely did not not that (62:57 - 63:01)
one (63:00 - 63:06)
though I yeah I did I did (63:01 - 63:09)
I do because I really liked the pose (63:06 - 63:11)
honestly (63:09 - 63:15)
I do like poses yeah and I thought you (63:11 - 63:17)
know the pose poses by itself for five (63:15 - 63:20)
bucks I do really like the Mr mime pose (63:17 - 63:23)
I was like ah to me and I think I think (63:20 - 63:26)
I remember that episode where Greg was (63:23 - 63:27)
like (63:26 - 63:29)
I would never use any of the items so (63:27 - 63:31)
it's not worth it to me and I was like (63:29 - 63:33)
well I want the pose so that's five (63:31 - 63:36)
dollars on its own or would be five (63:33 - 63:37)
dollars I'm doing air quotes for the (63:36 - 63:39)
audio podcast and I was like all these (63:37 - 63:41)
items are way more than five dollars and (63:39 - 63:43)
I'm gonna use all of those items so to (63:41 - 63:46)
me it was worth it (63:43 - 63:48)
if it I I didn't care about Mr mime he (63:46 - 63:51)
was just like oh I got Mr Mom cool (63:48 - 63:54)
Bobby I think paid the 7.99 of course I (63:51 - 63:58)
paid the 7.99 you know me at all (63:54 - 64:00)
I'm the one who didn't (63:58 - 64:03)
so are you more willing Hannah to pay (64:00 - 64:06)
the 7.99 for Keldeo or is this is this a (64:03 - 64:07)
no deal for you (64:06 - 64:13)
maybe if it was 15 rare candy not 14. (64:07 - 64:14)
I (64:13 - 64:15)
I want to say that it was an ethical (64:14 - 64:17)
decision that I didn't want to pay the (64:15 - 64:19)
the money for the Mr mime but most of it (64:17 - 64:21)
was just that I don't like the Mr mime (64:19 - 64:24)
so and I do like Keldeo (64:21 - 64:26)
and I I think that I probably will pay (64:24 - 64:28)
for this one I also like that there are (64:26 - 64:30)
incubators in there (64:28 - 64:33)
um there are when it feels like a little (64:30 - 64:36)
nice extra bonus I like getting them I'm (64:33 - 64:39)
not usually one to buy them specifically (64:36 - 64:42)
but (64:39 - 64:42)
then you can give them 15 and then there (64:42 - 64:47)
you go (64:46 - 64:50)
I could if I was going I don't know if I (64:47 - 64:52)
will (64:50 - 64:54)
the Keldeo and the shirt even though (64:52 - 64:55)
it's not a shirt that I will probably (64:54 - 64:58)
wear I do like having the items in game (64:55 - 65:01)
I click I changed my Avatar's clothing a (64:58 - 65:02)
bunch (65:01 - 65:05)
um and the incubators those three things (65:02 - 65:10)
I like and Kelly was a nice Pokemon (65:05 - 65:12)
yeah I like aldio (65:10 - 65:13)
um (65:12 - 65:17)
I I I I know I'm in this weird camp (65:13 - 65:20)
where (65:17 - 65:20)
I I (65:21 - 65:26)
okay so I have to like lay this out (65:23 - 65:29)
there are people on Facebook or Ebay (65:26 - 65:31)
that just sell like hacked Pokemon right (65:29 - 65:33)
like if you want a shiny Charizard and (65:31 - 65:34)
sword and shield you can you can pay (65:33 - 65:36)
somebody on eBay like two bucks they (65:34 - 65:38)
made it like PK hacks right they made it (65:36 - 65:40)
in like some sort of external program (65:38 - 65:42)
they duplicate them they just sell them (65:40 - 65:45)
clearly it works right like you go to (65:42 - 65:48)
these eBay profiles and they have like 8 (65:45 - 65:50)
000 things sold and it's like well just (65:48 - 65:52)
do the math math you sold 8 000 Pokemon (65:50 - 65:55)
for two bucks each clearly you're making (65:52 - 65:57)
money (65:55 - 66:00)
um I would never in a million years buy (65:57 - 66:03)
a shiny Char PK hex Charizard for two (66:00 - 66:05)
dollars on eBay somebody out there is (66:03 - 66:08)
doing that there's also uh Facebook (66:05 - 66:10)
groups dedicated to this right there (66:08 - 66:12)
there are discords and Facebook groups (66:10 - 66:14)
dedicated to also selling Shiny Pokemon (66:12 - 66:17)
it's why you know when you were in sword (66:14 - 66:19)
and shield or other games before you get (66:17 - 66:21)
Wonder traded a Shiny Pokemon it says uh (66:19 - 66:25)
Pokemon name.com right like like they (66:21 - 66:26)
want you to go to that website and then (66:25 - 66:28)
when you get there you realize they're (66:26 - 66:30)
selling Pokemon (66:28 - 66:33)
um (66:30 - 66:33)
I think Pokemon go has definitely become (66:33 - 66:39)
a pay for this Pokemon experience and I (66:36 - 66:41)
don't necessarily know if Niantic wanted (66:39 - 66:43)
it to go that way but that's what it is (66:41 - 66:45)
now right you pay a dollar you get the (66:43 - 66:48)
Pokemon in the raid you pay twenty (66:45 - 66:49)
dollars hopefully you get the shiny (66:48 - 66:53)
Pokemon in the raid that being said I I (66:49 - 66:55)
clearly say not gonna pay two dollars (66:53 - 66:58)
for shiny Charizard from eBay but I have (66:55 - 67:01)
paid for Pokemon in the sense of like (66:58 - 67:04)
this Pokemon was only in Japan this (67:01 - 67:08)
Japanese person has a code card I am (67:04 - 67:10)
paying for the code card to then redeem (67:08 - 67:12)
the Pokemon in game like there was for (67:10 - 67:15)
when bdsp and Pokemon Legends launched (67:12 - 67:17)
if you went to a specific Pokemon Center (67:15 - 67:19)
I can't remember which one it was you (67:17 - 67:23)
could get a Piplup for both bdsp and (67:19 - 67:25)
legends it was a little code card it (67:23 - 67:27)
came with two codes one for bdsp one for (67:25 - 67:28)
Legends (67:27 - 67:29)
um all you had to do was walk into the (67:28 - 67:31)
Pokemon Center buy one thing or whatever (67:29 - 67:33)
they give you the code card to celebrate (67:31 - 67:36)
the opening of that Pokemon Center (67:33 - 67:37)
and there was a bunch of those on eBay (67:36 - 67:40)
and I bought one it was I think it was (67:37 - 67:42)
like 15 bucks and they mailed me I (67:40 - 67:44)
somewhere on my desk they mailed me the (67:42 - 67:46)
code card I opened it up I scratched it (67:44 - 67:49)
off I redeemed both ones and I I have (67:46 - 67:51)
paid for Pokemon before right I paid for (67:49 - 67:53)
two piplups then all they have is little (67:51 - 67:54)
ribbons I think they're they're fine (67:53 - 67:56)
though I like them a lot they go they go (67:54 - 67:58)
in my collection in Pokemon home I'm (67:56 - 67:59)
very into it so I have paid for Pokemon (67:58 - 68:02)
so (67:59 - 68:02)
am I are those good decisions no of (68:03 - 68:08)
course not I don't think they are but I (68:06 - 68:12)
they make me happy so I think the deal (68:08 - 68:15)
here is bad I think 7.99 for what you're (68:12 - 68:18)
getting is actually a bad deal I don't (68:15 - 68:19)
know what makes that deal a little bit (68:18 - 68:21)
better for me I don't know if it was (68:19 - 68:25)
like more rare candy or or or more maybe (68:21 - 68:27)
if there were some lucky eggs or maybe (68:25 - 68:29)
if there's some star pieces I just I (68:27 - 68:32)
look at the look if there was a pose (68:29 - 68:32)
there's a pose definitely I just feel (68:32 - 68:40)
like the 799 isn't getting you enough (68:35 - 68:42)
that being said (68:40 - 68:46)
I want an extra Keldeo (68:42 - 68:46)
for my collection I'm like I'm thinking (68:47 - 68:51)
my Pokemon Home Collection I'm just like (68:49 - 68:54)
having an extra Cal deal right like (68:51 - 68:55)
um (68:54 - 68:58)
but but it's weird though because like I (68:55 - 69:01)
think it's a bad deal but I killed you (68:58 - 69:03)
I'm going to do it what is wrong with me (69:01 - 69:05)
this is something I need to bring up in (69:03 - 69:08)
therapy like look therapist I see that (69:05 - 69:11)
this is a bad deal but I I I want the ca (69:08 - 69:13)
I still want the Keldeo but if you want (69:11 - 69:17)
every legitimate Pokemon yes I mean (69:13 - 69:19)
that's true that's that's the difference (69:17 - 69:20)
there (69:19 - 69:22)
it's also the items also are worth more (69:20 - 69:24)
than eight dollars I mean in the pricing (69:22 - 69:26)
that Niantic has (69:24 - 69:29)
put that out there now right like you (69:26 - 69:31)
know so I mean like if you showed your (69:29 - 69:33)
therapist the math they'd be like well (69:31 - 69:35)
that makes sense they would be like does (69:33 - 69:38)
this bring you Joy yeah yeah they would (69:35 - 69:41)
yeah exactly (69:38 - 69:44)
um I I think the Keldeo will be free (69:41 - 69:47)
later though I mean oh yeah it's not (69:44 - 69:48)
like (69:47 - 69:50)
if you don't buy Keldeo right now you (69:48 - 69:52)
will never get Keldeo in Pokemon go (69:50 - 69:54)
right it might be mythical has (69:52 - 69:56)
eventually been (69:54 - 70:00)
free yeah it might end up in the what (69:56 - 70:03)
are they at this point Elite raids (70:00 - 70:05)
maybe they could or but I think that a (70:03 - 70:06)
research will eventually happen for (70:05 - 70:08)
Keldeo that will (70:06 - 70:11)
that everybody will be able to do (70:08 - 70:13)
um you'd hope so (70:11 - 70:16)
has there been one for regic I guess (70:13 - 70:18)
yeah well no that was it was ex raids (70:16 - 70:20)
right before they stopped doing ex raids (70:18 - 70:22)
was right yeah I guess I think that you (70:20 - 70:24)
could pay for Regigigas through some (70:22 - 70:26)
sort of research and then they did the X (70:24 - 70:27)
raids as well (70:26 - 70:31)
that was 7.99 but it was an actual like (70:27 - 70:32)
event (70:31 - 70:36)
yeah like it was it was like a it was (70:32 - 70:37)
almost like a raid day where you got (70:36 - 70:39)
like didn't you get like 10 raid passes (70:37 - 70:42)
and then at the end you got Reggie gigas (70:39 - 70:44)
and yeah because you had to take (70:42 - 70:46)
pictures of Regice and Regirock and (70:44 - 70:48)
Reggie steel and there was a whole thing (70:46 - 70:50)
to it when you had to catch them and (70:48 - 70:52)
everything (70:50 - 70:52)
um (70:52 - 70:54)
but (70:52 - 70:55)
yeah well then Reggie because came back (70:54 - 70:57)
at some point because you could get a (70:55 - 70:58)
shiny one (70:57 - 71:00)
yeah I think it came back in regular (70:58 - 71:02)
raids it did come back in regular raids (71:00 - 71:03)
at one point because yeah the shiny one (71:02 - 71:05)
was is available is in the game as well (71:03 - 71:08)
I had forgotten about that yeah it's (71:05 - 71:09)
weird because like (71:08 - 71:11)
you have events that are bad (71:09 - 71:14)
like I think this event is I I think I (71:11 - 71:15)
think a lot of people agree that the Mr (71:14 - 71:17)
mime event was bad right I think that (71:15 - 71:18)
was that was and then you have events (71:17 - 71:20)
that are completely like really good (71:18 - 71:22)
like they just gave us a shiny Celebi at (71:20 - 71:24)
one point for Christmas right it was it (71:22 - 71:25)
was like three quest lines and at the (71:24 - 71:27)
end you got shiny Celebi and you you (71:25 - 71:29)
didn't have to do any work (71:27 - 71:30)
um yeah but they tied that to the movie (71:29 - 71:32)
right they tied that to the but it's (71:30 - 71:36)
still it's still an event uh that people (71:32 - 71:38)
experience right like (71:36 - 71:40)
it's like what like if you're not (71:38 - 71:42)
listening to a Pokemon podcast and (71:40 - 71:44)
you're just opening up Pokemon go twice (71:42 - 71:46)
a month and you're like well this this (71:44 - 71:47)
thing this weekend gave me a shiny (71:46 - 71:49)
Celebi and you open it up and you're (71:47 - 71:52)
like oh I want this Pony Pokemon (71:49 - 71:54)
oh why it's not even shiny why am I (71:52 - 71:57)
paying eight bucks for it (71:54 - 71:57)
and that's fine that's fine some some (71:58 - 72:04)
events are ticketed some are not I I (72:01 - 72:05)
don't think we're arguing that I just I (72:04 - 72:08)
just think that for the 7.99 you're not (72:05 - 72:11)
really getting a lot here is there any (72:08 - 72:14)
other way right now legitimately to get (72:11 - 72:17)
a Keldeo in the Pokemon Universe (72:14 - 72:20)
the sword special DLC (72:17 - 72:22)
oh right right okay so you have to spend (72:20 - 72:24)
sixty dollars and then you have to spend (72:22 - 72:26)
another thirty dollars and you have to (72:24 - 72:29)
play (72:26 - 72:29)
like a bunch (72:29 - 72:35)
like I'm pretty sure (72:33 - 72:37)
you could probably get to it pretty fast (72:35 - 72:39)
because I don't (72:37 - 72:41)
know you you do have to beat Leon (72:39 - 72:43)
because I don't think the swords of (72:41 - 72:46)
justice spawn until Leah until you catch (72:43 - 72:48)
colorex (72:46 - 72:50)
like I don't think the swords of justice (72:48 - 72:52)
are there until calorics is caught right (72:50 - 72:56)
because peony needs to move from one (72:52 - 72:58)
place to another (72:56 - 73:00)
and he has to say like oh I see (72:58 - 73:02)
Footprints or whatever is it it's either (73:00 - 73:04)
peony or Sonia somebody has to tell you (73:02 - 73:06)
that there's Footprints and then you (73:04 - 73:07)
gotta find the footprints and then you (73:06 - 73:10)
gotta if anyone doesn't know by the way (73:07 - 73:12)
you can get a Keldeo in the in the DLC (73:10 - 73:14)
of sword and shield this is a thing it's (73:12 - 73:17)
shiny locked but we have to follow the (73:14 - 73:20)
footprints in the snow and then that (73:17 - 73:23)
makes Terrakion viruzion kobalian spawn (73:20 - 73:24)
you have to catch all three then you (73:23 - 73:26)
have to put all three in your party and (73:24 - 73:27)
then you have to go to like this little (73:26 - 73:28)
pot (73:27 - 73:31)
near the big tree where Zapdos Articuno (73:28 - 73:33)
multi spawns and then Keldeo will spawn (73:31 - 73:35)
I did a whole video about this (73:33 - 73:38)
um on YouTube but you can get a Keldeo (73:35 - 73:39)
and technically you can get as many (73:38 - 73:42)
Keldeo as you want but you would have to (73:39 - 73:44)
do that experience over and over again (73:42 - 73:47)
and pay ninety dollars you can get a (73:44 - 73:49)
Keldeo right now for eight dollars (73:47 - 73:51)
through Pokemon go or you can spend (73:49 - 73:55)
ninety dollars and get a Keldeo through (73:51 - 73:57)
sword and shield so when you put it in (73:55 - 73:58)
that perspective I'll take it for eight (73:57 - 73:59)
bucks (73:58 - 74:02)
here's a here's a real thing I thought (73:59 - 74:05)
about I went to four targets (74:02 - 74:08)
because I wanted a marsh Shadow code (74:05 - 74:11)
oh (74:08 - 74:14)
and and I went I went to the Target I (74:11 - 74:16)
always go to and I said hey man you got (74:14 - 74:19)
that Pokemon code and he goes we don't (74:16 - 74:20)
have them in yet we're supposed to get (74:19 - 74:22)
them in later this week and I was like (74:20 - 74:24)
okay cool and then like a couple days (74:22 - 74:26)
later I was at another Target I walked (74:24 - 74:28)
in I was like hey you got that Pokemon (74:26 - 74:30)
code and she was like nope we're all out (74:28 - 74:32)
I was like okay that's at least you know (74:30 - 74:34)
what I'm talking about then I went back (74:32 - 74:36)
to the original Target a couple days (74:34 - 74:38)
later and I was like hey you got that (74:36 - 74:40)
Pokemon code and she was like I don't (74:38 - 74:42)
work in electronics I don't know where (74:40 - 74:44)
the guy is and I was like okay I'll wait (74:42 - 74:46)
and then she was like oh he's not coming (74:44 - 74:48)
back for like an hour and I was like (74:46 - 74:50)
okay but do you have the Pokemon code (74:48 - 74:52)
and she's like maybe I don't know where (74:50 - 74:54)
they would be and I was like okay and (74:52 - 74:55)
then she kind of looked around and she (74:54 - 74:56)
was like I don't know and I was like I (74:55 - 74:58)
don't want to wait an hour and then I (74:56 - 74:59)
went to a different Target and I was (74:58 - 75:01)
like hey you got that Pokemon code she's (74:59 - 75:02)
like nope we sold out and I was like (75:01 - 75:04)
well at least you (75:02 - 75:06)
I will get I'll just pay five dollars (75:04 - 75:08)
somebody give me the code I will send (75:06 - 75:10)
you five dollars I don't wanna go to (75:08 - 75:13)
Target anymore I like (75:10 - 75:16)
I I just thought there's a certain point (75:13 - 75:17)
where like I don't want to go to (75:16 - 75:19)
GameStop I don't want to go to Target (75:17 - 75:21)
I'll just go to eBay I'll just give (75:19 - 75:23)
somebody five bucks and they'll send me (75:21 - 75:26)
the piece of paper in the mail it's fine (75:23 - 75:27)
they're more limited than they used to (75:26 - 75:28)
be (75:27 - 75:31)
distributions I felt like they keep (75:28 - 75:33)
running out they do shiny Alternatives (75:31 - 75:35)
was that way as well I went in there and (75:33 - 75:37)
she the person I said uh it was GameStop (75:35 - 75:40)
for shiny to turn to this yes and walked (75:37 - 75:43)
in said hey you know have that code and (75:40 - 75:45)
surprisingly the GameStop that I go to (75:43 - 75:46)
that's near my house is actually (75:45 - 75:49)
wonderful like I walk in there the (75:46 - 75:50)
people they kind of know me now because (75:49 - 75:51)
I've been going in there to buy Cards (75:50 - 75:53)
and like get the codes and stuff and so (75:51 - 75:55)
they're like real talkative they're you (75:53 - 75:56)
know we're just we chat for a bit it's (75:55 - 75:58)
kind of empty all the time which is bad (75:56 - 76:02)
for them but great for me uh and so I (75:58 - 76:04)
went in there and was like hey can I get (76:02 - 76:05)
a code for Alternatives yep that's fine (76:04 - 76:08)
I said okay I have both sword and shield (76:05 - 76:11)
can I get a second one and she literally (76:08 - 76:13)
picked up the stack this was day one and (76:11 - 76:15)
she was like I have like six codes for (76:13 - 76:18)
for the whole thing so she's like no I (76:15 - 76:20)
can't give you a second coat it's just (76:18 - 76:24)
like wow yeah it was just so limited I (76:20 - 76:26)
went to (76:24 - 76:28)
what what was the last what was the (76:26 - 76:30)
event that happened when shiny turn just (76:28 - 76:32)
came out it was it was a it was a (76:30 - 76:34)
comedic wasn't it (76:32 - 76:37)
it because I went to a I went to a park (76:34 - 76:38)
with Greg and will (76:37 - 76:40)
it was like rock and roll a community (76:38 - 76:42)
day or it was some Community Day okay (76:40 - 76:44)
and it was it was that community and (76:42 - 76:45)
then Chinese tournaments came out so I (76:44 - 76:47)
went I went to a park that because it (76:45 - 76:49)
was nice outside didn't go to mall (76:47 - 76:52)
America went to a park we played it we (76:49 - 76:54)
did it and then I when I was leaving the (76:52 - 76:56)
park I typed in GameStop and I was like (76:54 - 76:57)
oh cool there's a GameStop like five (76:56 - 76:59)
minutes driving from the park never I'm (76:57 - 77:01)
not out here like I'm not in this area (76:59 - 77:02)
ever (77:01 - 77:04)
I went to the GameStop walked inside got (77:02 - 77:07)
two codes he was really cool and then I (77:04 - 77:09)
left and the next day I was at Mall of (77:07 - 77:11)
America so Sunday I was at Mall of (77:09 - 77:12)
America and I was like oh I'm gonna walk (77:11 - 77:15)
in get more codes right because like I (77:12 - 77:17)
know people in our community they not (77:15 - 77:19)
near GameStop I'm gonna get codes to (77:17 - 77:20)
give to people that listen to the show (77:19 - 77:22)
and I walked in and I was like hey can I (77:20 - 77:24)
get a code for Alternatives and they (77:22 - 77:26)
were like we well we don't have any more (77:24 - 77:28)
codes they were like yesterday was (77:26 - 77:30)
Community Day at Mall of America and (77:28 - 77:31)
people came in and they got codes and we (77:30 - 77:33)
we won't have any more codes for the (77:31 - 77:34)
entire thing and I was like can you (77:33 - 77:36)
print me a code out on the receipt I (77:34 - 77:37)
used to work at GameStop this was a (77:36 - 77:39)
thing we could do it (77:37 - 77:42)
for the for the Growlithe distribution (77:39 - 77:44)
when Arceus came out they did that at (77:42 - 77:45)
the game stuff I went to they printed it (77:44 - 77:47)
out they weren't actually able to print (77:45 - 77:48)
out individual ones for people but they (77:47 - 77:51)
just had a sheet of codes yeah yeah I (77:48 - 77:52)
could go into the system when I worked (77:51 - 77:54)
at GameStop and I could print out like (77:52 - 77:56)
100 codes at once on this huge receipt (77:54 - 77:58)
paper yeah and then you would just like (77:56 - 77:59)
take a scissors you would just cut them (77:58 - 78:01)
and hand it to the person and I was like (77:59 - 78:03)
can't you guys print them out and she (78:01 - 78:04)
was like we we can only do that for (78:03 - 78:05)
certain events we can't do it for this (78:04 - 78:07)
event and I was like (78:05 - 78:10)
okay I was like maybe you're lying to me (78:07 - 78:11)
but (78:10 - 78:13)
she was but like yeah like the Growlithe (78:11 - 78:15)
event wasn't that long ago it was like (78:13 - 78:18)
earlier less than a year ago yeah (78:15 - 78:19)
yeah so she was like yeah we can't print (78:18 - 78:21)
any out for this one and I was like oh (78:19 - 78:23)
okay I guess (78:21 - 78:26)
um so weird but like to run out of codes (78:23 - 78:28)
like okay (78:26 - 78:30)
mall America is very busy it was (78:28 - 78:32)
Community Day you're bringing Pokemon (78:30 - 78:33)
fans to Mall of America totally (78:32 - 78:36)
understand but like dang first day we're (78:33 - 78:38)
already out of codes like (78:36 - 78:40)
that sucks (78:38 - 78:42)
yeah it's not great I don't understand (78:40 - 78:43)
especially because (78:42 - 78:45)
when that when they announced Chinese (78:43 - 78:47)
Alternatives they didn't announce it for (78:45 - 78:48)
everywhere right it was like they (78:47 - 78:51)
announced it for America I think maybe (78:48 - 78:54)
Canada and Australia I want to say but (78:51 - 78:56)
they didn't the EU they didn't announce (78:54 - 78:58)
it for that and so everyone like in the (78:56 - 79:00)
slack chat was like oh let's you know (78:58 - 79:02)
figure out trading we can trade you the (79:00 - 79:04)
those marshadow and stuff codes you (79:02 - 79:06)
trade us the shiny Alternatives and then (79:04 - 79:09)
recently they I think they did the whole (79:06 - 79:11)
uh I forget which country it is where (79:09 - 79:13)
they do email instead of like having to (79:11 - 79:15)
go get a code you can just sign up for a (79:13 - 79:16)
thing and they'll send you it's usually (79:15 - 79:18)
like France or Germany yeah something (79:16 - 79:19)
like that (79:18 - 79:20)
um (79:19 - 79:22)
but they did that for Alternatives so (79:20 - 79:24)
it's like okay well if you guys can do (79:22 - 79:25)
that then (79:24 - 79:28)
why did you make it so limited no but I (79:25 - 79:30)
hate the email thing too because like I (79:28 - 79:32)
never got the email for zarude (79:30 - 79:34)
you're never gonna let that go yeah and (79:32 - 79:36)
they're like well make sure you have (79:34 - 79:38)
marketing turned on it was like no I I (79:36 - 79:40)
got the three emails the day before zuru (79:38 - 79:41)
that you send out and I got the two (79:40 - 79:44)
emails the day after the rude that I (79:41 - 79:46)
have all the check boxes checked I have (79:44 - 79:48)
everything I mean I feel you on that I (79:46 - 79:50)
still am missing the year of Legends (79:48 - 79:53)
Reggie gigas and Heatran because it was (79:50 - 79:54)
the newsletter it was the one month of (79:53 - 79:56)
that like thing where it was the (79:54 - 79:58)
newsletter and they never sent me a (79:56 - 80:00)
thing for those and I'm still super (79:58 - 80:03)
bitter because the only two of the (80:00 - 80:05)
legends of the year of Legends that I (80:03 - 80:08)
don't have in the cherish balls so the (80:05 - 80:10)
end of this conversation is I think the (80:08 - 80:12)
caldeo is a rip-off but I will pay it (80:10 - 80:15)
because I would rather just not miss it (80:12 - 80:16)
there you go (80:15 - 80:19)
that's the very least guaranteed I just (80:16 - 80:21)
yeah I just don't want to go to any more (80:19 - 80:23)
targets (80:21 - 80:23)
uh well I think that that wraps up (80:25 - 80:29)
today's show (80:27 - 80:30)
um (80:29 - 80:32)
uh Hannah you'll have to send me what (80:30 - 80:34)
Twitter you would like I'll put it in (80:32 - 80:36)
the little thing that pops up on the (80:34 - 80:39)
YouTube video sounds good I am Hannah's (80:36 - 80:41)
pixels pretty much everywhere perfect (80:39 - 80:44)
and then Bobby has a DOT somewhere or (80:41 - 80:47)
the not a DOT somewhere I can't help it (80:44 - 80:49)
the Instagram won't take the person down (80:47 - 80:52)
who has one post seven years ago and has (80:49 - 80:56)
like 12 followers that has no dot it's (80:52 - 80:58)
really annoying but Pokemon snaps pretty (80:56 - 80:59)
much everywhere if you look that up (80:58 - 81:00)
you'll find me (80:59 - 81:02)
uh if you want to follow the podcast on (81:00 - 81:07)
YouTube uh Instagram Twitter twitch p k (81:02 - 81:10)
m n c a s t uh I'll be streaming all (81:07 - 81:12)
week uh scarlet and violet I think the (81:10 - 81:13)
only days I'm not going to be streaming (81:12 - 81:15)
going into the rest of the years (81:13 - 81:16)
probably on like Wednesdays are probably (81:15 - 81:18)
gonna be my day off uh there still will (81:16 - 81:19)
be two more (81:18 - 81:23)
mini episodes of super picnic club uh on (81:19 - 81:26)
the December 8th should be the the gym (81:23 - 81:28)
leaders and the Elite Four and then on (81:26 - 81:32)
December 9th should be area zero (81:28 - 81:34)
um so those mini episodes should go up (81:32 - 81:36)
I'll still be streaming on Twitch all (81:34 - 81:39)
this week uh for just completing my (81:36 - 81:41)
Pokedex we didn't talk about Charizard (81:39 - 81:43)
oh my gosh we made it 90 minutes I was (81:41 - 81:46)
talking about Charizard uh here's my (81:43 - 81:48)
summary it was way easier than (81:46 - 81:50)
everyone expected but I think it's (81:48 - 81:52)
because people plan for it (81:50 - 81:55)
right I mean I'm think my highest level (81:52 - 81:59)
Pokemon right now is level about 38. so (81:55 - 82:00)
I gotta do a lot of work in the next (81:59 - 82:02)
when does it come back the Charizard (82:00 - 82:03)
comes (82:02 - 82:07)
the 15th 15th 16th 17th 18th so I got (82:03 - 82:09)
like 12 days probably we can talk about (82:07 - 82:11)
Charizard next week because (82:09 - 82:13)
I I think a lot of people weren't even (82:11 - 82:15)
ready this week for Charizard so yeah I (82:13 - 82:17)
plan to do a one and done and then was (82:15 - 82:19)
not able to get a good Pokemon up to the (82:17 - 82:21)
right level for it yeah (82:19 - 82:23)
um so we'll we'll talk about Charizard (82:21 - 82:25)
next week uh I (82:23 - 82:27)
I think we need to talk about how people (82:25 - 82:28)
don't understand (82:27 - 82:32)
how teresalizing works because uh I saw (82:28 - 82:34)
a bunch of people bring a water type (82:32 - 82:37)
Pokemon to a fairy (82:34 - 82:40)
sorry a psychic Talon flame and I was (82:37 - 82:44)
like oh it's that fire anymore it's it's (82:40 - 82:47)
psychic now I think I think the little (82:44 - 82:49)
symbol up there it's a psychic I think (82:47 - 82:51)
that is a little bit of a hard thing for (82:49 - 82:53)
people to grasp because then they want (82:51 - 82:56)
to bring what is uh strong against (82:53 - 82:59)
psychic but like that Talonflame may (82:56 - 83:01)
still have fire moves so it's like then (82:59 - 83:02)
you got to worry about you know I mean (83:01 - 83:03)
obviously there's a little bit more (83:02 - 83:06)
strategy to it when you add in that the (83:03 - 83:09)
uh type changes also some people just (83:06 - 83:09)
still (83:09 - 83:11)
don't know how type change how types (83:09 - 83:14)
really work against each other other (83:11 - 83:16)
than the very obvious ones so I I get (83:14 - 83:18)
that but (83:16 - 83:20)
um yeah I it's only been like two weeks (83:18 - 83:22)
of the game's been out three weeks give (83:20 - 83:25)
people a little time the entire time Hop (83:22 - 83:27)
was trying to teach us about tight (83:25 - 83:28)
weakness and people were like ah hop (83:27 - 83:30)
keeps bothering we have hot talks too (83:28 - 83:31)
much now y'all didn't learn your lesson (83:30 - 83:33)
yeah they prepped us for this y'all (83:31 - 83:35)
didn't learn your lesson hop knew what (83:33 - 83:37)
was happening he knew about time to put (83:35 - 83:39)
it in the school they didn't put it in (83:37 - 83:41)
the school they mention it they say that (83:39 - 83:44)
type weaknesses exist they ask if you (83:41 - 83:45)
know it they don't teach it everybody (83:44 - 83:47)
probably says yes because they think (83:45 - 83:48)
they know yeah everyone says yes (83:47 - 83:51)
everyone's lying no one knows how these (83:48 - 83:53)
type weaknesses work (83:51 - 83:53)
um (83:53 - 83:55)
yeah we'll talk about Charizard next (83:53 - 83:57)
