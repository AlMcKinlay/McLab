for the week hopefully they're being (1:20 - 1:26)
safe not gonna miss a week here I took (1:23 - 1:28)
the last couple days off twitch just as (1:26 - 1:31)
a vacation but obviously podcasts still (1:28 - 1:34)
happening whether uh I don't know the (1:31 - 1:37)
Sun is in the sky or not there will (1:34 - 1:39)
always be a podcast on Monday so we're (1:37 - 1:43)
gonna get through this and get you your (1:39 - 1:47)
Pokemon news yeah I wish we knew what (1:43 - 1:50)
raids were rotating on Monday night (1:47 - 1:53)
because Meowth will be over so if you're (1:50 - 1:54)
listening this Monday morning and you (1:53 - 1:57)
have not gotten your Giganta max me out (1:54 - 2:00)
get it but we will have some new raids (1:57 - 2:04)
on June the first app I think it rotated (2:00 - 2:07)
well it rotates at zero UTC which is (2:04 - 2:10)
like 7:00 p.m. Central Time I think I (2:07 - 2:13)
think it's because it's 4 p.m. Pacific (2:10 - 2:18)
so I think it's isn't it 5:00 Pacific is (2:13 - 2:22)
it is it 5:00 o because time changed (2:18 - 2:25)
yeah my pad I don't know I understand (2:22 - 2:28)
TTC I think it's I think you're right I (2:25 - 2:30)
think you're raves do well it's it's (2:28 - 2:32)
kind of worse for me right because half (2:30 - 2:35)
of the year I am at the same time is UTC (2:32 - 2:38)
and then work so most of the time when (2:35 - 2:39)
someone says UTC I don't (2:38 - 2:41)
to calculate anything but then in the (2:39 - 2:43)
summer I obviously have to add on an (2:41 - 2:45)
hour which is annoying oh lucky you (2:43 - 2:48)
because yeah it's it's we're like seven (2:45 - 2:49)
hours or eight hours behind depending on (2:48 - 2:52)
the time of year yeah you guys do uh (2:49 - 2:54)
daylight savings time too (2:52 - 2:56)
yeah not for long though hopefully (2:54 - 2:59)
really getting rid of it smart move (2:56 - 3:03)
although it's not confirmed whether the (2:59 - 3:06)
UK will is or not but like let's not get (3:03 - 3:09)
into that Europe European Union is (3:06 - 3:13)
getting active daily same thing alright (3:09 - 3:16)
well let's jump into the news I have in (3:13 - 3:19)
front of me here I think most of this is (3:16 - 3:23)
good news this is off Anime News Network (3:19 - 3:26)
calm the Internet's most trusted anime (3:23 - 3:29)
news source according to the tagline (3:26 - 3:32)
this actually just came out right before (3:29 - 3:33)
we started recording but the Pokemon (3:32 - 3:37)
journey TV anime resumes new episodes on (3:33 - 3:41)
June 7th after the Cova 19 delay this is (3:37 - 3:43)
uh the first time that the Japanese (3:41 - 3:46)
anime has kind of been off the air for (3:43 - 3:50)
quite a while but they're back on June (3:46 - 3:53)
7th the staff was temporarily suspended (3:50 - 3:55)
part of its production series due to the (3:53 - 3:57)
corona virus I had because of the state (3:55 - 4:00)
emergency declared in Japan Japan has (3:57 - 4:02)
lifted the state emergency nationwide (4:00 - 4:07)
this past Tuesday the twilight wings was (4:02 - 4:10)
also delayed but the fifth episode is (4:07 - 4:14)
scheduled for June 5th and I believe (4:10 - 4:19)
there is no word or the new movie which (4:14 - 4:22)
was supposed to come out July 10th (4:19 - 4:24)
there's no rescheduled date for the Coco (4:22 - 4:27)
movie but the Japanese anime returns on (4:24 - 4:30)
June 7th highlight wings for everyone on (4:27 - 4:36)
June 5th and then or us customers the (4:30 - 4:39)
first 12 episodes episodes of Pokemon (4:36 - 4:43)
journeys TV adventure I don't know what (4:39 - 4:44)
it was a series called Pokemon the (4:43 - 4:47)
journeys poke my journeys this is a (4:44 - 4:49)
series the series (4:47 - 4:53)
that comes out on Netflix on June 12th (4:49 - 4:56)
and then so that delay didn't didn't (4:53 - 4:58)
hold up the first 12 episodes was that (4:56 - 5:02)
where those films were those my studio (4:58 - 5:04)
audience (5:02 - 5:09)
so what episode were they on in Japan at (5:04 - 5:12)
2200 you wanted to uh yeah okay got it (5:09 - 5:15)
that makes sense them and that was on (5:12 - 5:18)
the 18th of April I believe this is the (5:15 - 5:22)
longest gap in since their Paragon (5:18 - 5:25)
episode in the anime what was that that (5:22 - 5:27)
was our weeks that was it was a (5:25 - 5:30)
four-month one actually oh whoa Wow it (5:27 - 5:32)
was from December the 16th till April (5:30 - 5:35)
the 16th there was more than the porygon (5:32 - 5:37)
episode there was other yeah but they (5:35 - 5:39)
were all short they were all like just a (5:37 - 5:42)
couple of weeks yeah that was like (5:39 - 5:44)
Japan's huge initiative to like change a (5:42 - 5:46)
bunch of stuff cuz yeah Pokemon wasn't (5:44 - 5:49)
the only cause of that I was gonna say (5:46 - 5:54)
wow that big it for that one episode if (5:49 - 5:56)
you're one of our Canadian listeners (5:54 - 5:59)
it's already on the first episode VN may (5:56 - 6:02)
already appeared on Teletoon Teletoon le (5:59 - 6:07)
tele tune on may 9th i also believe it's (6:02 - 6:09)
either happened last Saturday or is (6:07 - 6:11)
happening next Saturday that the first (6:09 - 6:15)
four episodes are airing in the UK but (6:11 - 6:16)
then we don't get any more till (6:15 - 6:20)
September what what do you say regular (6:16 - 6:22)
TV or do well you get you guys have that (6:20 - 6:25)
flicks and Hulu and everything but we do (6:22 - 6:28)
but we're not so we're getting it on TV (6:25 - 6:29)
channel that I'd never heard of before (6:28 - 6:35)
called pop for your next channel no (6:29 - 6:38)
apparently has been around for ages but (6:35 - 6:39)
yeah they're there they've announced (6:38 - 6:41)
that they're going to do I think is four (6:39 - 6:45)
episodes on Saturday or lasts actually I (6:41 - 6:47)
Cameron which one so four altogether (6:45 - 6:50)
play in a row yeah I think so four on (6:47 - 6:53)
one day and then one again anymore until (6:50 - 6:54)
September (6:53 - 7:00)
what an odd choice I know yeah I mean (6:54 - 7:02)
year ago but going back to the movie (7:00 - 7:03)
being (7:02 - 7:05)
hold I that doesn't surprise me just (7:03 - 7:08)
because that's probably more due to the (7:05 - 7:11)
movie theater situation than it is yeah (7:08 - 7:14)
you know the movie itself and I don't (7:11 - 7:18)
see movie theaters well I guess some are (7:14 - 7:20)
already opening but I feel like the (7:18 - 7:22)
smart decision to be to keep movie (7:20 - 7:23)
theatres closed for a longer period of (7:22 - 7:24)
time (7:23 - 7:27)
so this is the first time a movie is a (7:24 - 7:29)
Pokemon movie has not debuted in July (7:27 - 7:33)
yeah assuming I mean I guess it could (7:29 - 7:34)
come out like July 30 (7:33 - 7:38)
but yes originally scheduled for July (7:34 - 7:40)
10th so we don't have a we don't have a (7:38 - 7:43)
date on that I'm sure Anime News Network (7:40 - 7:46)
the Internet's most trusted anime new (7:43 - 7:48)
source will keep us up to date well just (7:46 - 7:50)
knock out the Pokemon masters news right (7:48 - 7:52)
away just somebody characters got added (7:50 - 7:54)
full disclosure I do have a partnership (7:52 - 8:00)
DNA dawn and Turtwig have been added to (7:54 - 8:04)
the game and she'll run between May 27th (8:00 - 8:08)
through June 10th and I believe jasmine (8:04 - 8:10)
and steelix are still a band that you (8:08 - 8:14)
can pull on and I believe there is a the (8:10 - 8:17)
flying-type Advent is still going blind (8:14 - 8:19)
type training event is still going to (8:17 - 8:23)
June 4th and then the battle Villa (8:19 - 8:27)
Refresh will go till June 11th ok so I (8:23 - 8:30)
have played this game for about a total (8:27 - 8:37)
of 12 minutes ok ever so I'll have you (8:30 - 8:40)
played it at all or are we in a complete (8:37 - 8:41)
world where it's just Steve you know I (8:40 - 8:43)
think I think I'm the same as well yeah (8:41 - 8:45)
we're gonna really miss Greg on this one (8:43 - 8:48)
cuz ya know I started it and when ya (8:45 - 8:50)
know I'm all right thanks I didn't find (8:48 - 8:54)
him yeah it was I don't know I think (8:50 - 8:56)
that if I wasn't already playing other (8:54 - 8:58)
mobile games I may have picked it up but (8:56 - 9:01)
it was just another game that I I didn't (8:58 - 9:03)
want to jump into it just didn't didn't (9:01 - 9:06)
grasp my attention as quickly as I would (9:03 - 9:07)
have liked (9:06 - 9:09)
yeah I'm Steve you I assume you're still (9:07 - 9:12)
playing and pulling (9:09 - 9:14)
stuff and trying to get the best pairs (9:12 - 9:17)
and everything uh yeah I'm I'm more (9:14 - 9:21)
trying to get like one of every pair hmm (9:17 - 9:24)
which is now seemingly impossible it (9:21 - 9:27)
feels like because at this point I'm (9:24 - 9:30)
just balling a bunch of duplicates right (9:27 - 9:32)
right I know I don't ever sit there I've (9:30 - 9:33)
said this in the podcast before I (9:32 - 9:35)
remember sit there and play this game (9:33 - 9:37)
like an hour straight or two hours (9:35 - 9:38)
straight or try to like get everything (9:37 - 9:41)
done in a day I just do a couple matches (9:38 - 9:42)
when I wake up do a couple matches right (9:41 - 9:45)
before bed and that's it and it's been (9:42 - 9:48)
enjoyable for me but that's how that's (9:45 - 9:49)
how like other mobile games I played (9:48 - 9:52)
like clash Royale you know I'd wake up (9:49 - 9:54)
I'd do like two matches (9:52 - 9:56)
I'd be like sitting at a dentist office (9:54 - 9:59)
I'll do a match like right before bed (9:56 - 10:00)
I'll do a match and that's that's it (9:59 - 10:02)
like I never sat there and played like (10:00 - 10:04)
three hours of clash Royale in a row (10:02 - 10:06)
like I mean there's nothing wrong with (10:04 - 10:10)
that just not your style not yeah not my (10:06 - 10:12)
style but see I'm the opposite I think (10:10 - 10:16)
like I have a hard time if I pick up a (10:12 - 10:18)
game just playing it for a few minutes (10:16 - 10:21)
and putting it down like if if I if I (10:18 - 10:23)
only have a few minutes to kill I'm you (10:21 - 10:25)
they're gonna be hopping on Twitter or (10:23 - 10:28)
Instagram or something I like to be able (10:25 - 10:30)
to sit down for a little bit of time and (10:28 - 10:32)
play a game and obviously that's made (10:30 - 10:33)
Pokemon go a bit different now that it's (10:32 - 10:35)
all at home instead of being out walking (10:33 - 10:38)
around but yeah I know I'm not a big fan (10:35 - 10:40)
of just the open it for a couple minutes (10:38 - 10:42)
and close the game don't really work for (10:40 - 10:44)
me the main reason I brought up a lot of (10:42 - 10:48)
these dates is like DOM and the battle (10:44 - 10:51)
Villa and flying-type event is they're (10:48 - 10:53)
all ending the second week of June I (10:51 - 10:55)
don't know I look I don't have any (10:53 - 10:58)
inside information but it's no secret (10:55 - 11:00)
that the sword and shield TLC is coming (10:58 - 11:03)
out sometime in June so I'm just curious (11:00 - 11:05)
if there will be just like how Pokemon (11:03 - 11:07)
go has the which we're going to talk (11:05 - 11:10)
about the the gallery Pokemon being (11:07 - 11:12)
added I'm curious if masters will do (11:10 - 11:15)
anything of the sort because I'm sure (11:12 - 11:17)
they will right yeah cuz they'll always (11:15 - 11:19)
all match up together which is cool (11:17 - 11:21)
which is very cool of them to do I guess (11:19 - 11:23)
we'll just have to wait and see so (11:21 - 11:26)
gallery Pokemon in Pokemon Quest (11:23 - 11:28)
/ yes quest will get updated and masters (11:26 - 11:31)
will get updated at the same time oh how (11:28 - 11:34)
I wish I was actually thinking about (11:31 - 11:36)
going back and playing quest again cuz I (11:34 - 11:38)
was going through my games on my switch (11:36 - 11:40)
and when all it was a fun game I didn't (11:38 - 11:45)
do it I thought about it though it's a (11:40 - 11:47)
good get I love quest clifftop great (11:45 - 11:49)
game all right speaking of the Pokemon (11:47 - 11:51)

research breakthrough just what we (12:18 - 12:22)
always wanted yeah alright that (12:20 - 12:23)
community today with less than a year (12:22 - 12:25)
ago wasn't enough I was actually quite (12:23 - 12:27)
liking having chinks because you know it (12:25 - 12:29)
was a weekly chance of getting a shiny (12:27 - 12:32)
Ching's same well you have absolutely (12:29 - 12:34)

research breakthrough so I have I can (12:36 - 12:40)
get one more chance at a shiny Shinx (12:39 - 12:45)
today yeah you better get that Shing I (12:40 - 12:49)
would my my quick read on the Internet (12:45 - 12:55)
is people were unhappy about the trap (12:49 - 12:57)
inch and still you know we're we're over (12:55 - 12:59)
six months now and people are still (12:57 - 13:00)
complaining that there's a lack of (12:59 - 13:02)
legendary sinner in these research (13:00 - 13:05)
breakthroughs I feel like that boat has (13:02 - 13:05)
sailed (13:05 - 13:08)
I don't know look the new thing to (13:05 - 13:09)
complain about is denying go back to (13:08 - 13:12)
leak anymore right right yeah (13:09 - 13:14)
I said well research breakthrough (13:12 - 13:16)
they've left go battle II and now you (13:14 - 13:18)
got to buy that remote raid pass well (13:16 - 13:20)
and I get them from your home yeah and I (13:18 - 13:21)
don't like to complain about these (13:20 - 13:24)
things too much but even if I do buy a (13:21 - 13:25)
room will read pass I'm never gonna be (13:24 - 13:27)
able to you get the legendaries because (13:25 - 13:29)
there's nobody near me playing just now (13:27 - 13:31)
I used to get all of my raids in (13:29 - 13:33)
Edinburgh which I can't go to legally (13:31 - 13:37)
just now so how well you got away for (13:33 - 13:39)
those no one invites no (13:37 - 13:42)
doing rows uh 6:00 p.m. right hours for (13:39 - 13:46)
you oh no no the issue is I can see one (13:42 - 13:50)
gem from my house and everyone at the is (13:46 - 13:54)
in the vague area is like miles away (13:50 - 13:57)
they can see other gems like I'm sure (13:54 - 13:59)
that's great for people in cities but it (13:57 - 14:02)
just does not work here kind of but I'm (13:59 - 14:04)
it's funny I can actually see 12 gems (14:02 - 14:06)
from my house and those raid hours still (14:04 - 14:10)
the people like the groups that I'm in (14:06 - 14:12)
like the facebook Messenger or discord (14:10 - 14:14)
groups that I'm in they all just happen (14:12 - 14:16)
to be a little bit further east than (14:14 - 14:18)
what I can see so even though I can see (14:16 - 14:21)
12 gems none of them ever have anybody (14:18 - 14:22)
actually reading for the most part (14:21 - 14:25)
during those raid hours I mean I'm (14:22 - 14:27)
grateful to be able to ac-12 gems from (14:25 - 14:29)
my house because I can do a lot of solo (14:27 - 14:31)
raids but when it comes to those tier 5 (14:29 - 14:34)
ones it's a little bit harder for me to (14:31 - 14:35)
do them even though I have so many gems (14:34 - 14:38)
around me I go to the same park on (14:35 - 14:40)
Wednesdays it's the same group of people (14:38 - 14:44)
and what's just the word awful pretended (14:40 - 14:47)
I use the word awful define they exist (14:44 - 14:51)
oh no it's just 45 minutes of hearing (14:47 - 14:54)
them shout about shiny 100 IV Pokemon (14:51 - 14:58)
they caught during Helios with quaza how (14:54 - 15:00)
to pronounce a lute yeah uh you know I (14:58 - 15:03)
wasn't standing close enough to them (15:00 - 15:05)
like the only word that's ever stands (15:03 - 15:07)
out from when they're yelling at each (15:05 - 15:10)
other is the word shiny but I wasn't (15:07 - 15:12)
standing close enough near them to hear (15:10 - 15:15)
them pronounce Russia Ram I feeling like (15:12 - 15:18)
Russia rhymes pretty easy to say yeah (15:15 - 15:19)
that's not I don't think that's too bad (15:18 - 15:22)
I just like the image of Steve pulling (15:19 - 15:25)
up to a park it being like your whatever (15:22 - 15:27)
music you're playing in your car and as (15:25 - 15:28)
soon as you turn your car off and get (15:27 - 15:30)
out it's just 12 people yelling at each (15:28 - 15:33)
other for 45 minutes and then you're (15:30 - 15:34)
getting back into your car music turning (15:33 - 15:36)
on and you're driving home that's a (15:34 - 15:40)
hundred percent how my Wednesday's are (15:36 - 15:42)
it's fine just just wait till Arceus (15:40 - 15:44)
comes out you'll have fun with the (15:42 - 15:46)
pronunciation oh yeah yeah yeah that's (15:44 - 15:48)
gonna be terrible hopefully by then (15:46 - 15:51)
they've figured it out an in-game thing (15:48 - 15:54)
that pronounces the names I've been (15:51 - 15:54)
is there even a Pokemon okay so when (15:55 - 16:02)
when when research had Legendary's (15:58 - 16:04)
people complained about that that's this (16:02 - 16:07)
is the problem is it's not it I don't (16:04 - 16:09)
think poor trapinch getting all the hate (16:07 - 16:12)
but I remember specifically when it was (16:09 - 16:15)
Latios latias in research people were (16:12 - 16:17)
complaining that like a lot T us a lot T (16:15 - 16:20)
us or just we have enough we don't need (16:17 - 16:22)
them anymore give us something else or (16:20 - 16:24)
if it was nap dose or Articuno room all (16:22 - 16:26)
trace you know people are like Dodds Dex (16:24 - 16:27)
filler none of these Pokemon are (16:26 - 16:29)
actually good it was really bad when (16:27 - 16:31)
that was there Reggie's pre shiny and (16:29 - 16:34)
everyone was like pitchforks in the air (16:31 - 16:37)
running toward Niantic headquarters just (16:34 - 16:39)
yeah I mean you're never gonna make (16:37 - 16:43)
people happy could put dialga and Palkia (16:39 - 16:46)
in field research with a with a hundred (16:43 - 16:49)
percent chance of shinee and people (16:46 - 16:52)
would still complain because like after (16:49 - 16:54)
the first week they would be like huh (16:52 - 16:57)
this is I'm sick of state like I don't (16:54 - 16:59)
know what Pokemon they could put in (16:57 - 17:03)
field research that would make people (16:59 - 17:06)
happy and it's field research it's so (17:03 - 17:09)
easy to do right I think you I think (17:06 - 17:11)
you're thinking about this the wrong way (17:09 - 17:12)
right don't try and think about which (17:11 - 17:15)
Pokemon would make people happy but (17:12 - 17:16)
think about how they could change it to (17:15 - 17:17)
make people happy (17:16 - 17:20)
so obviously this is a lot more than (17:17 - 17:21)
just deciding which Pokemon to go into (17:20 - 17:23)
but if they had a way for you to (17:21 - 17:25)
actually be able to decide which Pokemon (17:23 - 17:28)
you got out of up a group of them (17:25 - 17:31)
then I feel like that would be a lot (17:28 - 17:34)
closer especially if you know say you (17:31 - 17:36)
could choose between a legendary or (17:34 - 17:38)
another Pokemon that is guaranteed to (17:36 - 17:41)
have very high stats you know that sort (17:38 - 17:43)
of thing would probably keep most people (17:41 - 17:46)
happy within a within reason that's true (17:43 - 17:48)
I'd be kind of fun if yeah if there was (17:46 - 17:51)
like a a you got like a choice of (17:48 - 17:53)
legendary or like you said like high (17:51 - 17:55)
Ivy's or or like really good go battle (17:53 - 17:57)
League or something you know like you (17:55 - 17:59)
had the options like that and then you (17:57 - 18:01)
work towards that and yeah yeah it (17:59 - 18:02)
doesn't even need to be like a specific (18:01 - 18:05)
like choose a Moltres or of whoever I'm (18:02 - 18:10)
so good up on the what's popular and (18:05 - 18:13)
battling but but yeah it could be as you (18:10 - 18:15)
say just like groups of them so you (18:13 - 18:17)
choose between which group you want to (18:15 - 18:20)
do that's probably a lot more work I (18:17 - 18:22)
think also people forget that like you (18:20 - 18:25)
get experience you get a chance at a you (18:22 - 18:27)
know bastogne I think there's probably (18:25 - 18:30)
still a sinister tone and that role too (18:27 - 18:33)
yes cuz I've got them likes to be weeks (18:30 - 18:35)
in a row I was gonna say yeah because (18:33 - 18:37)
all I'm ever seeing our sin up stones so (18:35 - 18:38)
they die no we still know our stones (18:37 - 18:41)
[Laughter] (18:38 - 18:45)
like we're complaining again okay I got (18:41 - 18:46)
three another stones in a row one one (18:45 - 18:49)
time it was sweet Wow shoulda bought a (18:46 - 18:52)
lottery ticket after that seriously I (18:49 - 18:54)
think the thing you suggested al is (18:52 - 18:56)
really cool I just it's just that field (18:54 - 18:59)
research is so incredibly easy that yeah (18:56 - 19:02)
especially now with them giving us a new (18:59 - 19:04)
task every night that's like transfer 10 (19:02 - 19:06)
Pokemon every every day I'm like (19:04 - 19:08)
accidentally doing one of these things (19:06 - 19:10)
right like I really I just want to get (19:08 - 19:12)
to the point where I have no completed (19:10 - 19:14)
ones because that little circle is (19:12 - 19:16)
always orange and is really annoying (19:14 - 19:18)
having always orange because you don't (19:16 - 19:19)
know whether you've done one of the (19:18 - 19:22)
reasons the those research or whether (19:19 - 19:24)
you've done one of the the special (19:22 - 19:27)
research or one of them like total one (19:24 - 19:29)
the timed ones yeah it's really annoying (19:27 - 19:30)
it's like I just want to complete these (19:29 - 19:32)
but of course I don't want to use them (19:30 - 19:33)
up because then I won't have one for (19:32 - 19:35)
tomorrow (19:33 - 19:39)
it's a hard life hey I still have I (19:35 - 19:42)
there was a you remember the what was it (19:39 - 19:44)
April Fool's event with that crow got (19:42 - 19:46)
was a Croagunk in like sudowoodo and (19:44 - 19:49)
yeah yeah yeah I still have the catch (19:46 - 19:51)
three ditto task which will give me a (19:49 - 19:54)
Croagunk which I'm sure if I delete this (19:51 - 19:56)
task it would have been a shiny pro dunk (19:54 - 19:58)
you're looking so fit us now holding on (19:56 - 20:00)
to this the other day I go +2 ditto (19:58 - 20:02)
and I was like okay so I just need one (20:00 - 20:04)
more but I've been holding on to it (20:02 - 20:06)
since I don't know mid April I was like (20:04 - 20:08)
I got the task like an hour before the (20:06 - 20:10)
event ended when there was all the ditto (20:08 - 20:13)
spawning so didn't have a chance to (20:10 - 20:15)
catch my three one day one day I'll get (20:13 - 20:19)
that third data Zekrom makes their (20:15 - 20:24)
electrifying go debut on June 16th the (20:19 - 20:26)
deep black Pokemon will be waiting for (20:24 - 20:28)

1st that's really interesting because (20:34 - 20:41)
that takes us into the time period after (20:37 - 20:42)
the dlc will have been released right (20:41 - 20:46)
yep so obviously they're gonna wait till (20:42 - 20:48)
after that before anything related to (20:46 - 20:51)
the DLC comes well I feel in terms of (20:48 - 20:56)
like died legendry they rotated they (20:51 - 20:57)
have done overlapping events before (20:56 - 20:59)
haven't they so they could just uh (20:57 - 21:04)
believe again I'll never mind (20:59 - 21:07)
ignore me better believe they like to (21:04 - 21:10)
overlap events again this yeah so we got (21:07 - 21:13)

they wouldn't work the ticket if you (23:05 - 23:13)
missed it will be $7.99 (23:11 - 23:16)
you cannot use pokey coins to buy it you (23:13 - 23:19)
must use some real money I have a (23:16 - 23:21)
love-hate relationship with it's fine' (23:19 - 23:23)
it's just annoying for somebody who buys (23:21 - 23:27)
like $100 worth of pokey coins to last (23:23 - 23:30)
six months yeah and then go feel like an (23:27 - 23:33)
aunt decision it reminds me of that (23:30 - 23:35)
episode of The Simpsons where Homer is (23:33 - 23:37)
like takes the kids to like the fake (23:35 - 23:39)
Disneyland itchy and scratchy land and (23:37 - 23:41)
like the guy is like would you like to (23:39 - 23:43)
buy some itchy and scratchy money and (23:41 - 23:45)
he's like yeah sure and he buys a bunch (23:43 - 23:47)
and then he walks into the theme park (23:45 - 23:49)
and everywhere says like we do not (23:47 - 23:54)
accept itchy and sketchy 100% whatever (23:49 - 23:58)
reminds me of it's weird right because (23:54 - 23:59)
you (23:58 - 24:00)
assume that the reason they're doing it (23:59 - 24:02)
right is so that you can't like use the (24:00 - 24:06)
free coins to do but by that logic if (24:02 - 24:08)
they used the free coins to buy the (24:06 - 24:10)
ticket they then wouldn't have the free (24:08 - 24:13)
coins to use on something else and if (24:10 - 24:15)
they're the sort person isn't then going (24:13 - 24:16)
to buy the coins to make that up (24:15 - 24:19)
they wouldn't have bought the ticket in (24:16 - 24:20)
the first place so I don't think this (24:19 - 24:22)
would actually gain them any extra money (24:20 - 24:25)
it just seems like a really weird weird (24:22 - 24:28)
decision to make it almost seems like (24:25 - 24:30)
and I have no knowledge of this haven't (24:28 - 24:32)
looked into it anyone is has more (24:30 - 24:34)
knowledge than great please tweet me (24:32 - 24:38)
whatever but it almost seems like it's (24:34 - 24:40)
almost related to like the legality of (24:38 - 24:43)
when they call things event like based (24:40 - 24:44)
on how they call things events like in (24:43 - 24:47)
digitally and how it can't be in-game (24:44 - 24:49)
care it seems almost like there's a (24:47 - 24:50)
standard behind it because like you're (24:49 - 24:52)
saying how I don't actually see this (24:50 - 24:55)
making them a whole lot more money than (24:52 - 24:58)
what you're already saying so it almost (24:55 - 24:59)
seems like there's something more behind (24:58 - 25:02)
it that has to do with (24:59 - 25:04)
I don't know something with their terms (25:02 - 25:05)
and conditions or something with their (25:04 - 25:07)
with the weak ality of how they're doing (25:05 - 25:10)
it but again I don't know it could just (25:07 - 25:12)
be hey maybe we'll make a few extra (25:10 - 25:15)
bucks would be I mean I guess I guess (25:12 - 25:16)
the one thing the one thing it could be (25:15 - 25:18)
if it wasn't some legal thing are you (25:16 - 25:20)
thinking of you're you're suggesting is (25:18 - 25:22)
I guess it could be kind of getting (25:20 - 25:27)
people into buying stuff so you're ready (25:22 - 25:29)
a little video yeah exactly so many (25:27 - 25:31)
people won't buy coins right because (25:29 - 25:32)
it's not really something they're buying (25:31 - 25:35)
whereas if it's are especially their (25:32 - 25:39)
community ones right whether $1.99 like (25:35 - 25:42)
they're under under a quid a dollar and (25:39 - 25:44)
yeah you know that that that's really (25:42 - 25:46)
easy to just go oh yeah fine I'll do (25:44 - 25:48)
that and then if you didn't like have (25:46 - 25:50)
your credit card information in Google (25:48 - 25:54)
Play or iTunes then you know do I know (25:50 - 25:56)
it's much easier to then buy things in (25:54 - 25:57)
the future and it's almost yeah it's (25:56 - 25:59)
it's a lot of people I've seen talking (25:57 - 26:00)
about well I'm not gonna buy this (25:59 - 26:02)
because I don't I don't spend money on (26:00 - 26:04)
this game where eyes if they had already (26:02 - 26:06)
spent money on it they probably would (26:04 - 26:07)
have done it so maybe it's something (26:06 - 26:09)
like that that makes a lot of sense are (26:07 - 26:12)
all all arrays my last thought and go (26:09 - 26:14)
with yours out cuz makes life sense for (26:12 - 26:15)
the $7.99 ones right because they're (26:14 - 26:18)
that's much less that's a lot more to (26:15 - 26:20)
kind of commit to whereas if you've wake (26:18 - 26:21)
up in the morning for community then you (26:20 - 26:23)
say oh there's one that's ninety nine P (26:21 - 26:25)
and it gives me a bunch of stuff you're (26:23 - 26:26)
like yeah I'll do that (26:25 - 26:28)
eight pounds that's quite a lot more (26:26 - 26:32)
yeah that's true I will say I like I (26:28 - 26:34)
like the I like that this event is free (26:32 - 26:36)
for the people who did it (26:34 - 26:38)
although they probably should have (26:36 - 26:41)
announced the ticket beforehand cuz when (26:38 - 26:42)
we'll talked about missing the first (26:41 - 26:44)
week he was like well now I have no (26:42 - 26:46)
drive to do the rest of the weeks (26:44 - 26:48)
because I can't participate in this (26:46 - 26:51)
event when it happens so I do like okay (26:48 - 26:54)
if you missed it if you're busy you can (26:51 - 26:56)
still participate at $7.99 and there are (26:54 - 26:58)
definitely games that do that like Final (26:56 - 27:01)
Fantasy 14 they have like a Halloween (26:58 - 27:03)
event or an Easter event like usually at (27:01 - 27:05)
the end of that event you get like a (27:03 - 27:08)
free mount like a writable item so you (27:05 - 27:11)
can ride through the world so like for (27:08 - 27:12)
the Halloween event it was you know (27:11 - 27:15)
complete these four tasks in the (27:12 - 27:16)
two-week period (27:15 - 27:17)
you get this low witch broom that you (27:16 - 27:20)
can ride around and then once the event (27:17 - 27:22)
is over if you missed it you can just (27:20 - 27:24)
pay $4.99 in the store and get that (27:22 - 27:27)
witch broom and it's it's nice because (27:24 - 27:29)
it doesn't it's like the opposite thing (27:27 - 27:34)
of what like destiny 2 does which is hey (27:29 - 27:36)
only this week you can earn this one (27:34 - 27:38)
emblem and if you don't earn it it's (27:36 - 27:41)
gone forever and then you start to get (27:38 - 27:42)
in this mindset of like I can't I (27:41 - 27:44)
literally can't keep up with all these (27:42 - 27:47)
events and then once you once you like (27:44 - 27:49)
miss one and then you missed 2 and then (27:47 - 27:51)
you missed 3 you go I don't care anymore (27:49 - 27:53)
but they don't want the player to not (27:51 - 27:56)
care right they want the player to care (27:53 - 27:57)
to do the events but at a certain point (27:56 - 28:01)
if you don't give players a chance to (27:57 - 28:04)
participate some other way then they're (28:01 - 28:06)
just going to walk away from your game (28:04 - 28:09)
yeah I mean I see I see two sides to (28:06 - 28:12)
that because I'm also seeing I agree (28:09 - 28:14)
more with let's give people multiple (28:12 - 28:16)
options to get something but I'm seeing (28:14 - 28:19)
the side of well things aren't exclusive (28:16 - 28:21)
anymore because people can just pay for (28:19 - 28:23)
them whereas I did all this work I'm (28:21 - 28:27)
quote air quotes work to you know get (28:23 - 28:29)
the the genesect and now someone can (28:27 - 28:31)
just pay eight dollars and get the (28:29 - 28:33)
genesect as well and it's not exclusive (28:31 - 28:37)
and well quite true because you still (28:33 - 28:38)
have to do the work to get it right it's (28:37 - 28:40)
not as much work as doing all of the (28:38 - 28:42)
four and then the fifth one but you (28:40 - 28:43)
still have to do all the fifth it's not (28:42 - 28:45)
like you pay eight dollars and then (28:43 - 28:47)
genesect just appears in your inventory (28:45 - 28:51)
that's true that is true and and I agree (28:47 - 28:55)
I also just think that it's okay first (28:51 - 28:58)
off you can't even trade mythical x' so (28:55 - 29:01)
yeah it's not worth anything I guess (28:58 - 29:03)
unless you go on eBay and sell your (29:01 - 29:06)
account to someone which shiny legit (29:03 - 29:09)
squared Charizard is at least worth two (29:06 - 29:11)
dollars come on right right I know I (29:09 - 29:13)
guess you guys went all through this (29:11 - 29:17)
last week but I think that there's a lot (29:13 - 29:18)
of look at what I have look at why I (29:17 - 29:21)
have that you see from well social media (29:18 - 29:25)
in general but with these what people (29:21 - 29:29)
want to call exclusives and I think that (29:25 - 29:31)
cares you should be able to just give (29:29 - 29:34)
players like multiple ways of gaining (29:31 - 29:37)
something so I'm okay with this I also (29:34 - 29:39)
agree that it should have been maybe (29:37 - 29:41)
stated at the beginning but I think they (29:39 - 29:42)
were trying to go for the surprise (29:41 - 29:44)
element and kind of do like a or maybe (29:42 - 29:45)
they hadn't even have it planned in the (29:44 - 29:47)
beginning to do it that way but when (29:45 - 29:49)
they realized a lot of people maybe they (29:47 - 29:51)
realized after the first week not a lot (29:49 - 29:54)
of people do care yeah they're like (29:51 - 29:56)
people didn't care enough for or didn't (29:54 - 29:57)
complete it so they're like oh we should (29:56 - 29:59)
give them another way of doing this (29:57 - 30:01)
either way I think it would have been (29:59 - 30:03)
nice to have that set at the beginning (30:01 - 30:06)
and then people would have had more of a (30:03 - 30:09)
an option whether you know it will (30:06 - 30:11)
wouldn't have been like well now I'm (30:09 - 30:14)
over this because I can't do it (30:11 - 30:17)
you know it people I feel like may have (30:14 - 30:19)
been a little bit turned off by that and (30:17 - 30:22)
then maybe wouldn't have been had they (30:19 - 30:24)
known that it was an option later they (30:22 - 30:26)
could by I guess yeah they didn't say (30:24 - 30:28)
how much Stardust or that you would get (30:26 - 30:31)
instead of professor Willis glasses but (30:28 - 30:33)
I don't know if you it's like worth it (30:31 - 30:37)
for me or you to if you completed all (30:33 - 30:40)
four events to spend another $7.99 I (30:37 - 30:42)
can't look I have a hundred and ninety (30:40 - 30:50)
star pieces so I'm not paying eight (30:42 - 30:52)
bucks for some star dust oh my face (30:50 - 30:55)
Steve with his rare candy could use them (30:52 - 31:00)
or delete them right also 594 rare candy (30:55 - 31:05)
so yeah goes right me insane look I I I (31:00 - 31:10)
have the rare candy back up again (31:05 - 31:11)
waiting (31:10 - 31:16)
um my star pieces yes our dust star so (31:11 - 31:19)
okay so here's my my thing when I first (31:16 - 31:24)
played this game I was in a very high (31:19 - 31:26)
traffic area where I worked where we (31:24 - 31:28)
raided and everything all the time so (31:26 - 31:31)
we're just constant raids all day long (31:28 - 31:33)
it was great and I used a lot of star (31:31 - 31:35)
dust then and I powered up a lot of (31:33 - 31:36)
stuff as much as I needed that was level (31:35 - 31:38)
forty so a lot of stuff got as high as (31:36 - 31:40)
it needed to (31:38 - 31:42)
since then I haven't read own trade (31:40 - 31:44)
nearly as much I switch jobs I'm in an (31:42 - 31:45)
area where I don't work as much now I'm (31:44 - 31:48)
just at home working so I don't rate as (31:45 - 31:51)
much so everything I have kind of fits (31:48 - 31:54)
like anytime a new raid boss comes out I (31:51 - 31:57)
have something that works against it and (31:54 - 32:00)
I powered enough in up at the time to (31:57 - 32:02)
deal with that so lately I've been (32:00 - 32:04)
powering up more stuff so I can try to (32:02 - 32:08)
beat stuff with less people but until a (32:04 - 32:10)
couple little remote raiding came out (32:08 - 32:13)
like I just didn't really have a reason (32:10 - 32:16)
to power the stuff up so got up to like (32:13 - 32:17)
7 million Stardust's you know and the (32:16 - 32:19)
reason I don't use my star pieces is cuz (32:17 - 32:22)
I forget I have them so there's that I (32:19 - 32:27)
shouldn't just have to bake a bag I'm (32:22 - 32:29)
still the person that pops the lucky egg (32:27 - 32:31)
when when I have like forced our friends (32:29 - 32:33)
to check off oh absolutely the same I (32:31 - 32:35)
was telling a couple of people in the (32:33 - 32:37)
slack the other day I was like hey let's (32:35 - 32:40)
you know line up for we're gonna hit (32:37 - 32:42)
best you know do you want to turn a (32:40 - 32:44)
lucky I gone and people were like aren't (32:42 - 32:47)
you level 40 like but there's still XP (32:44 - 32:51)
to game number so that keeps changing so (32:47 - 32:54)
at 50 million so I gotta hit that 50 if (32:51 - 32:56)
they hit the number I don't think people (32:54 - 32:58)
would nearly as care as much but the (32:56 - 33:01)
fact that that number changes if they (32:58 - 33:02)
hit the number I throw all my lucky eggs (33:01 - 33:05)
away yeah same well let me tell you I (33:02 - 33:08)
the minute I turned level 40 I deleted (33:05 - 33:14)
all my spare lucky eggs every single one (33:08 - 33:16)
I've got since then it's gonna straight (33:14 - 33:20)
in the bin hi God not need that nonsan (33:16 - 33:20)
steel if they ever implement the ability (33:22 - 33:27)
to send items through three gifts rather (33:25 - 33:29)
than just random gifts I will send you (33:27 - 33:31)
any lucky eggs I get all right don't (33:29 - 33:33)
want them if I could send them to (33:31 - 33:35)
someone I would it's just that I only (33:33 - 33:37)
have I've only paired myself up to thing (33:35 - 33:39)
a thousand space in my bag (33:37 - 33:43)
I don't need that's nonsense in there a (33:39 - 33:45)
thousand spit yeah see that's my problem (33:43 - 33:48)
set out my bag is too big I lose things (33:45 - 33:51)
I have 89 fast EMS I'm gonna use those (33:48 - 33:53)
yeah like 50 (33:51 - 33:55)
to charge teams I don't agree I don't go (33:53 - 33:57)
battle league enough deleted for these (33:55 - 33:58)
things (33:57 - 34:06)
well I yeah so hard to delete things do (33:58 - 34:07)
you keep all your pokeballs as well or (34:06 - 34:09)
do you leave them or maybe pokeballs (34:07 - 34:11)
about example because you use that with (34:09 - 34:14)
the pokeball + yeah yeah usually the (34:11 - 34:15)
great balls get deleted first the poke (34:14 - 34:18)
balls I have two key for the the plus (34:15 - 34:20)
and then the altar balls are usually (34:18 - 34:21)
like I'll burn through all the ultra (34:20 - 34:23)
balls on community cuz I want I don't (34:21 - 34:25)
want some thumb to break out so I'll (34:23 - 34:27)
just use the altar else I mean there (34:25 - 34:30)
yeah well community today is an (34:27 - 34:32)
interesting one why why I tend to do is (34:30 - 34:33)
I walk with my poker ball plus in one (34:32 - 34:35)
hand and my phone and the other tap once (34:33 - 34:37)
the poke of all plus notices something I (34:35 - 34:39)
tap on that Pokemon if it's not shiny I (34:37 - 34:41)
just get the pokeball plus two to do (34:39 - 34:43)
yeah cuz I don't really care about (34:41 - 34:44)
catching everything and if it's shiny (34:43 - 34:46)
I'll do it manually make sure I (34:44 - 34:47)
definitely get it but yeah like I don't (34:46 - 34:50)
I don't manually catch most of the (34:47 - 34:52)
pokemon on community day that's a smart (34:50 - 34:53)
move I never really did that when I was (34:52 - 34:55)
out walking around these last two I've (34:53 - 34:59)
been so since this thing for me is since (34:55 - 35:02)
the quarantine stuff started and the (34:59 - 35:05)
at-home stuff started I had a baby right (35:02 - 35:07)
so I had a baby on March first and then (35:05 - 35:09)
all the shelter and play stuff happened (35:07 - 35:11)
starting like right after that so I (35:09 - 35:14)
haven't left the house for multiple (35:11 - 35:17)
reasons but these last two community (35:14 - 35:19)
days I definitely haven't been able to (35:17 - 35:20)
really Ivan really got out and walked (35:19 - 35:23)
around so what I have been doing is just (35:20 - 35:26)
go Plus for like the entire 6 hours (35:23 - 35:27)
because the incense are three hours (35:26 - 35:29)
apiece right so I've just been talking (35:27 - 35:31)
to incense that gives me that six hours (35:29 - 35:34)
and then check it every few you know (35:31 - 35:36)
every 30 minutes your buddy brings you (35:34 - 35:39)
50 pokeballs or whatever so just kind of (35:36 - 35:42)
check in on it hopefully I get my you (35:39 - 35:45)
know three shinies and then kind of be (35:42 - 35:47)
on my way but it's mostly just bingo (35:45 - 35:50)
plus let's last couple months but once (35:47 - 35:52)
I'm out walking around and stuff going (35:50 - 35:54)
to parks for community again I'll (35:52 - 35:58)
probably do that and just check on (35:54 - 35:59)
and then go Plus um if they're not shiny (35:58 - 36:01)
because that makes a lot more sense yeah (35:59 - 36:05)
alright we got two more things to talk (36:01 - 36:07)
about pokemon girl related but we'll (36:05 - 36:09)
take a quick break and then when we come (36:07 - 36:14)
back we have some TCG stuff and some (36:09 - 36:15)
Pokemon Center stuff so we'll be right (36:14 - 36:17)
back (36:15 - 36:24)
[Music] (36:17 - 36:24)
[Music] (36:33 - 36:36)
[Applause] (36:37 - 36:40)
[Music] (36:37 - 36:40)
another episode otherwise (36:43 - 36:49)
[Applause] (36:46 - 36:49)
[Music] (36:49 - 36:54)
[Applause] (36:52 - 36:57)
[Music] (36:54 - 36:57)
not only do we have the genesect event (37:00 - 37:05)
in June we have two other events here (37:03 - 37:10)
the bug-out event is returning and the (37:05 - 37:13)
Solstice event is returning I think (37:10 - 37:15)
these are returning events right they've (37:13 - 37:18)
they happen Laster yeah we definitely (37:15 - 37:21)
saw this one definitely a bug-out event (37:18 - 37:24)
I feel like we had we had a bug event at (37:21 - 37:28)
one point I feel like but yeah in I (37:24 - 37:30)
don't know if it was like in June but (37:28 - 37:34)
the Solstice event was obviously but (37:30 - 37:36)
there's really no details here for these (37:34 - 37:39)
events except these the Solstice of (37:36 - 37:42)
solstice event will run June 19th (37:39 - 37:45)
through June 24th and the bug-out event (37:42 - 37:51)
will run June 26 through July 1st and (37:45 - 37:53)
that's pretty much eat it so they're (37:51 - 37:56)
both week long assuming that there will (37:53 - 38:00)
probably be new shinies assuming though (37:56 - 38:02)
it probably be eggs where people will be (38:00 - 38:05)
upset about what is in the egg course (38:02 - 38:08)
standard I am sure if somebody didn't (38:05 - 38:10)
complete the genesect event these events (38:08 - 38:13)
will block you from needing to do what (38:10 - 38:16)
you need to do right I think we already (38:13 - 38:18)
can tell what the shinies are I mean I (38:16 - 38:19)
think we're gonna talk about it but (38:18 - 38:21)
based on the spotlight our events oh (38:19 - 38:23)
yeah yeah because the spotlight our (38:21 - 38:25)
events highlight two Pokemon that are (38:23 - 38:27)
already shiny one fire-type Pokemon (38:25 - 38:29)
that's not shiny yet and one bug type (38:27 - 38:31)
Pokemon that's not shiny hit so people (38:29 - 38:34)
were a bit disappointed by this there's (38:31 - 38:36)
gonna be no spotlight our for June 2nd (38:34 - 38:39)
now Pokemon will go we'll be down on (38:36 - 38:41)
June 1st for I think like eight hours (38:39 - 38:44)
they said it's pretty long time yeah (38:41 - 38:46)
first time I was it's a database (38:44 - 38:47)
migration so they want to make sure (38:46 - 38:49)
they've got a lot of time is that what (38:47 - 38:51)
it is that's I think that's what they (38:49 - 38:53)
said that they want to migrate the (38:51 - 38:56)
database for some reason okay cuz I know (38:53 - 38:57)
people we're not given a details on it (38:56 - 39:00)
theories and stuff and you know you had (38:57 - 39:02)
everything from we're gonna get I don't (39:00 - 39:04)
know every shiny in the game and then (39:02 - 39:06)
all the way down to no they're just (39:04 - 39:08)
doing some maintenance and need to fix (39:06 - 39:09)
yeah I personally thought maybe I had to (39:08 - 39:12)
do with adding some back-end stuff to (39:09 - 39:12)
like this (39:12 - 39:14)
social features they're gonna put out (39:12 - 39:16)
eventually I mean the problem is race so (39:14 - 39:19)
it's it's not like they've never really (39:16 - 39:21)
had to have this sort of maintenance (39:19 - 39:23)
before other than issues around login at (39:21 - 39:27)
the very beginning right most of they (39:23 - 39:29)
generally deal with these things pretty (39:27 - 39:31)
well so like adding in features (39:29 - 39:33)
generally doesn't make sense right the (39:31 - 39:35)
way that they do is if they have a (39:33 - 39:38)
server change there are you know when (39:35 - 39:40)
you have a client it can handle the old (39:38 - 39:43)
server and the new server and the old (39:40 - 39:45)
the old client just handles the old (39:43 - 39:46)
server and then when you want to switch (39:45 - 39:47)
over to the new server (39:46 - 39:48)
you just MIT you just don't let people (39:47 - 39:50)
log in unless they have the new client (39:48 - 39:52)
right is pretty easy so so they've not (39:50 - 39:54)
really had any issues with that whereas (39:52 - 39:56)
a database um database migration if they (39:54 - 39:58)
actually want to change what the (39:56 - 40:01)
database is on because they that like (39:58 - 40:03)
that's kind of a really intensive thing (40:01 - 40:05)
to do and so they need to make sure that (40:03 - 40:08)
they get all of the data over correctly (40:05 - 40:10)
so what they do is they just say nobody (40:08 - 40:12)
can do anything at this point and then (40:10 - 40:14)
we know that this is all of the data we (40:12 - 40:16)
can migrate it all over and we know that (40:14 - 40:17)
by the time we finish migrating there (40:16 - 40:20)
isn't any new data in the old database (40:17 - 40:23)
before we then migrate over before we (40:20 - 40:25)
were before we then open up again and so (40:23 - 40:27)
really I think that's the only thing (40:25 - 40:28)
that we would make sense and I'm sure (40:27 - 40:30)
they've said it somewhere but I can't (40:28 - 40:33)
find it it's now gotcha yeah that would (40:30 - 40:36)
make sense now I know very little about (40:33 - 40:39)
any of that but I was wondering like if (40:36 - 40:41)
they did like a database migration would (40:39 - 40:43)
they be able to do something where you (40:41 - 40:44)
know how we have like there's like data (40:43 - 40:46)
miners now who go in and figure all this (40:44 - 40:48)
stuff out before it happens like is (40:46 - 40:49)
there a way that they could go in to be (40:48 - 40:52)
securing that so people can't do that or (40:49 - 40:53)
is that not gonna ver are they're always (40:52 - 40:55)
gonna be able to be data miners because (40:53 - 40:58)
yeah it's unlikely cuz it's mostly local (40:55 - 41:00)
data that they've been data mining got (40:58 - 41:02)
it okay yep oh right of course cuz it's (41:00 - 41:04)
when the update hits they're able to (41:02 - 41:07)
jump in and and look at it that way (41:04 - 41:10)
no spotlight our June second which is a (41:07 - 41:11)
bit of a bummer because I personally (41:10 - 41:13)
like the spot a spotlight ours a lot but (41:11 - 41:15)
it's the day after their maintenance so (41:13 - 41:18)
that's probably the reason why but (41:15 - 41:20)
spotlight our will return on June 9th (41:18 - 41:23)
it'll beep attract and you will earn (41:20 - 41:25)
that twice the XP for a volume Pokemon (41:23 - 41:26)
June 6 (41:25 - 41:30)
teenth will be numel numel I think it's (41:26 - 41:32)
numel and you will earn twice the amount (41:30 - 41:34)
of Stardust for catching Bobby make sure (41:32 - 41:36)
you turn on your star peace oh yeah I (41:34 - 41:39)
sent a reminder okay (41:36 - 41:42)
Tuesday June 23rd which will be during (41:39 - 41:45)
the solstice event it will be Clefairy (41:42 - 41:47)
and spotlight you will earn twice the (41:45 - 41:50)
amount of xp for catching and if you're (41:47 - 41:52)
lucky trainers that's what it says here (41:50 - 41:54)
you'll do you will encounter a shiny (41:52 - 41:59)
Clefairy and then on Tuesday June 30th (41:54 - 42:02)
cricket tot will appear in spotlight and (41:59 - 42:03)
you will earn twice the candy for (42:02 - 42:06)
catching so I think what Bobby hinted at (42:03 - 42:08)
was cricket top will be the bug out (42:06 - 42:11)
shiny new mo may not or normal may not (42:08 - 42:13)
be because I didn't realize that that (42:11 - 42:14)
spotlight event happens three days (42:13 - 42:18)
before yeah so then starts well Clefairy (42:14 - 42:20)
makes sense for the Solstice event (42:18 - 42:22)
because the salsas like Sun and Moon oh (42:20 - 42:26)
right and don't really but it's there's (42:22 - 42:29)
a loose connection this hence the name (42:26 - 42:32)
is to do with the Sun right Sol Sun yeah (42:29 - 42:35)
but I can definitely see them going or (42:32 - 42:41)
Sun that means moon as well and oh man (42:35 - 42:43)
does this mean that Clefairy is (42:41 - 42:44)
permanently gonna stay shining like (42:43 - 42:47)
sudowoodo and magmar have unless they (42:44 - 42:48)
pulled those recently but I'm pretty (42:47 - 42:51)
sure sudowoodo and egg mark still be (42:48 - 42:53)
shiny I think they can still be shiny as (42:51 - 42:55)
well umm (42:53 - 42:57)
it sucks that we have to say we think (42:55 - 43:00)
that nee antic left them right yeah I (42:57 - 43:03)
mean they did leave magmar for sure (43:00 - 43:06)
before so unless they just decided to (43:03 - 43:08)
randomly turn it off then and magmar (43:06 - 43:10)
should still be shiny I don't know I (43:08 - 43:12)
think well I don't know I think that (43:10 - 43:15)
they should keep them shiny there's no (43:12 - 43:17)
reason why they shouldn't I still think (43:15 - 43:19)
I don't know I still think that numel (43:17 - 43:22)
will become it would be weird to me if (43:19 - 43:24)
normal wasn't shiny but they've done it (43:22 - 43:26)
before they did with purloined they did (43:24 - 43:27)
a whole purloined hour with no shiny (43:26 - 43:30)
right and then they've done a shiny for (43:27 - 43:32)
everyone after that though right so even (43:30 - 43:35)
like Wobbuffet they allowed they that (43:32 - 43:37)
was when their debut Wobbuffet being (43:35 - 43:39)
shiny in the wild instead of having to (43:37 - 43:40)
catch a (43:39 - 43:43)
oh really oh yeah so I'm Robin fit our (43:40 - 43:47)
that way Wobbuffet was shiny in the (43:43 - 43:49)
raids when I had the party hat yeah and (43:47 - 43:51)
I don't know that people caught it I (43:49 - 43:53)
don't believe it was shiny in the wild (43:51 - 43:56)
until that spotlight hour which makes me (43:53 - 43:58)
feel like the purloined thing had so (43:56 - 44:00)
much backlash from it not being shiny (43:58 - 44:03)
that they've done it and they've done a (44:00 - 44:04)
shiny ever since I feel like Noma will (44:03 - 44:07)
be shiny but who knows we'll see June (44:04 - 44:10)

trainers and enjoy activities during go (44:55 - 45:00)
fest throughout the summer and that's it (44:57 - 45:03)
and in the picture because everyone (45:00 - 45:08)
always over analyzes the picture we were (45:03 - 45:10)
guilty of this as well there's a cherrim (45:08 - 45:13)
an oddish a Jigglypuff and a lowland (45:10 - 45:17)
execute' or in the pictures and a (45:13 - 45:20)
Pikachu and last year I think there was (45:17 - 45:23)
a Haunter which there was there was (45:20 - 45:25)
ghastly spawning at go fest last year (45:23 - 45:28)
there was a Haunter in the picture it (45:25 - 45:31)
meant nothing besides like gasps Lee was (45:28 - 45:33)
there like there was not a single wild (45:31 - 45:35)
hunter you could even catch it go fast (45:33 - 45:38)
it was just I think my favorite is that (45:35 - 45:41)
one was that people were like oh it's a (45:38 - 45:42)
hunter that means that they're gonna (45:41 - 45:45)
turn on Chinese for all levels of (45:42 - 45:50)
Pokemon like like plays a really big (45:45 - 45:52)
stretch right yeah (45:50 - 45:55)
I love those theories that's amazing (45:52 - 45:58)
yeah there's not I mean obviously like (45:55 - 46:00)
the biggest the biggest thing about the (45:58 - 46:01)
picture right is that it's like in a (46:00 - 46:03)
back yard so yeah you know there's no (46:01 - 46:05)
standard for tell us having a backyard (46:03 - 46:09)
with very perfect plants and trees (46:05 - 46:13)
growing and we all have that back yard (46:09 - 46:16)
well I mean I said it's a back yard it (46:13 - 46:18)
and say it was the standard backyard (46:16 - 46:21)
Bobby's like it was actually my backyard (46:18 - 46:25)
I just offered them a photo and they (46:21 - 46:30)
they took it uh-huh a go-fast has been (46:25 - 46:34)
anywhere between what 20 to 30 bucks you (46:30 - 46:37)
know 25 there's no way it'll be as (46:34 - 46:39)
expensive as the real-life one right (46:37 - 46:42)
though because like that goes towards (46:39 - 46:44)
the physical event whereas there aren't (46:42 - 46:47)
any costs relating to that but it is (46:44 - 46:48)
gonna it's probably going to be more (46:47 - 46:50)
expensive than your like your genesect (46:48 - 46:53)
or your um Reggie (46:50 - 46:55)
ever when it was Reggie Reggie waitress (46:53 - 47:02)
over both 799 yeah I I I'm gonna guess (46:55 - 47:03)
15 (47:02 - 47:05)
it's like safari zone pricing right what (47:03 - 47:07)
were safari zones I didn't I didn't I (47:05 - 47:09)
think there were plenty of them so yeah (47:07 - 47:14)
horizon's' 20 I'm gonna say $12.99 war (47:09 - 47:18)
okay that seems low yes doesn't seem low (47:14 - 47:20)
like that seems low for what Niantic (47:18 - 47:23)
would make it in my opinion it's gonna (47:20 - 47:25)
be a weird number I think for one if I (47:23 - 47:30)
have you like 15 27 right that weird but (47:25 - 47:33)
I think it's gonna be like I'm gonna go (47:30 - 47:36)
with 16.99 okay alright do you think (47:33 - 47:38)
they're gonna do an early access to or (47:36 - 47:42)
it's like you get to play two extra have (47:38 - 47:43)
they done that for any digital-only (47:42 - 47:48)
events ah no no they weren't right (47:43 - 47:50)
having it for the safari zones so far as (47:48 - 47:53)
the n go fest they have early access I (47:50 - 47:55)
guess technically the safari zones are (47:53 - 47:57)
digital only it's just digital only in a (47:55 - 47:58)
specific place like they don't have any (47:57 - 48:01)
pop-up stuff like there mmm like your (47:58 - 48:03)
whole fast that's true (48:01 - 48:05)
JB they well then I don't know did the (48:03 - 48:09)
Safari Zone stuff it you'd stuck with (48:05 - 48:10)
that like if you had that early access (48:09 - 48:12)
pass you got a couple extra hours right (48:10 - 48:14)
yeah but it was still only in the same (48:12 - 48:18)
location wasn't there like a an explorer (48:14 - 48:20)
Pass thing you could buy for the safari (48:18 - 48:23)
zones - yeah the London had a City Pass (48:20 - 48:28)
and I think Philly had a City Pass but (48:23 - 48:31)
hey don't even know what those entailed (48:28 - 48:34)
yeah in London or do you mean Liverpool (48:31 - 48:37)
Liverpool sorry I mean neither of them (48:34 - 48:39)
happened in real life anyway so I don't (48:37 - 48:41)
think we can right jump to any you know (48:39 - 48:44)
no is my question was just for those (48:41 - 48:46)
because they didn't happen in real life (48:44 - 48:48)
did people find it for the explore pass (48:46 - 48:50)
stuff that's note it was gonna entail (48:48 - 48:53)
anyway but you could have applied for a (48:50 - 48:55)
refund but you wouldn't have gotten that (48:53 - 48:58)
one off day that people got they take (48:55 - 49:01)
that away from you well then if you if (48:58 - 49:04)
you opted in to take the makeup day your (49:01 - 49:07)
pass is still valid for a future event (49:04 - 49:10)
which they haven't disclosed when or (49:07 - 49:14)
what that would be got it okay but if (49:10 - 49:15)
the future event is something you can't (49:14 - 49:17)
attend because you're out of town or (49:15 - 49:21)
you're sick or you moved you don't get a (49:17 - 49:23)
refund at that point because you've (49:21 - 49:26)
accepted that you had a makeup day right (49:23 - 49:27)
okay got it (49:26 - 49:33)
get all legal stuff I was going to (49:27 - 49:36)
deliver per one but then we decided me (49:33 - 49:38)
and my wife decided that I would only do (49:36 - 49:42)
one of one of Liverpool or Worlds and I (49:38 - 49:43)
was going to do world of course neither (49:42 - 49:50)
of them happened so I've not well I mean (49:43 - 49:53)
nobody's the winner except the hotel and (49:50 - 49:55)
the airline because I've not got my (49:53 - 49:59)
refunds for them yeah no a whole will (49:55 - 50:01)
you get them I I'm meant to be getting (49:59 - 50:03)
them but it's one of these things with (50:01 - 50:04)
her like it will take it could take up (50:03 - 50:06)
to 90 days and you don't actually get to (50:04 - 50:10)
can request the refund until close to (50:06 - 50:12)
the time anyway because that was like (50:10 - 50:14)
August wasn't it yeah yeah yeah I can't (50:12 - 50:17)
have the similar situation with my trip (50:14 - 50:20)
abroad I couldn't really care for him to (50:17 - 50:23)
like five days before yeah that's (50:20 - 50:25)
annoying yeah I was actually meant to be (50:23 - 50:27)
flying to the old man a couple of days (50:25 - 50:30)
ago and and I have managed to request (50:27 - 50:31)
the refund for that but it's not come (50:30 - 50:33)
through yet so I'm on the weird (50:31 - 50:35)
situation where the flight never (50:33 - 50:36)
happened and I couldn't have gone on it (50:35 - 50:39)
but I've not got the money back yet just (50:36 - 50:40)
there another me to read there that you (50:39 - 50:45)
had to get to Oh memories that was good (50:40 - 50:49)

doing that just flying over for the (50:49 - 50:53)
weekend just to do that buy it and it (50:51 - 50:54)
I'm not doing it cuz that's silly (50:53 - 51:00)
[Laughter] (50:54 - 51:00)
hey my wife was up for it that team as (51:01 - 51:09)
well this is off that's all agro news (51:03 - 51:12)
this next bit of news is off gonna Tendo (51:09 - 51:15)
Pokemon company and Mister donuts collab (51:12 - 51:19)
in Taiwan Pokemon company and Mister (51:15 - 51:20)
Donut some work together (51:19 - 51:22)
the past when it comes to Japan but now (51:20 - 51:24)
the two are collaborating for the first (51:22 - 51:27)
time in Taiwan right now there's just (51:24 - 51:30)
some artwork new details coming on June (51:27 - 51:33)
2nd so there's a very cute picture of a (51:30 - 51:38)
simple Pikachu with two Donuts floating (51:33 - 51:40)
around his head (51:38 - 51:43)
if you don't know mr. donut is mr. donut (51:40 - 51:45)
is probably like the Dunkin Donuts of (51:43 - 51:48)
Japan they're like everywhere very easy (51:45 - 51:52)
to walk into get a doughnut get out they (51:48 - 51:54)
have done plenty of Pokemon like when I (51:52 - 51:58)
was there in Japan actually Andrew who (51:54 - 52:02)
is our resident Japanese reporter we (51:58 - 52:04)
went to I went to mr. Donuts with Andrew (52:02 - 52:08)
and they had Pokemon toys for kids so I (52:04 - 52:09)
ordered off the kids menu so I could get (52:08 - 52:13)
the Pokemon toys nice of course as you (52:09 - 52:17)
do I feel like I feel like I don't (52:13 - 52:18)
understand any more with your (52:17 - 52:21)
explanation of it's like Dunkin Donuts (52:18 - 52:24)
however I also feel like it's probably (52:21 - 52:26)
not that difficult it's a place they (52:24 - 52:28)
make donuts they make sure they have (52:26 - 52:29)
three (52:28 - 52:31)
oh of course cuz because you can't (52:29 - 52:32)
really have a shop that sells food (52:31 - 52:33)
without coffee (52:32 - 52:37)
obviously right right I'm sure they (52:33 - 52:39)
maybe have tea as well (52:37 - 52:42)
probably so what does I don't know why (52:39 - 52:46)
you bring that up so it what is this (52:42 - 52:47)
like teaming up include is it just (52:46 - 52:49)
they're announcing all the details on (52:47 - 52:52)
Tuesday June 2nd so we don't actually (52:49 - 52:55)
know this is the best story ever (52:52 - 52:58)
something to do with Pokemon and Donuts (52:55 - 53:00)
they're both great things yeah I'm gonna (52:58 - 53:03)
happen we don't know I don't think (53:00 - 53:05)
anything bad could happen it sounds (53:03 - 53:05)
awesome (53:05 - 53:10)
oh I see no issues here (53:05 - 53:13)
well there is one issue the fact that is (53:10 - 53:16)
not here yeah that's true there's no mr. (53:13 - 53:21)
Donuts in America or Scotland sad (53:16 - 53:24)
this is off this was sent to me media (53:21 - 53:28)
alert Charizard and aterna tests make (53:24 - 53:31)
their Pokemon v-max debut in the new (53:28 - 53:33)
Pokemon Trading Card Game sword and (53:31 - 53:37)
shield darkness ablaze expansion I (53:33 - 53:41)
actually believe that this expansion got (53:37 - 53:46)
renamed last minute due to co vyd or (53:41 - 53:49)
that's the speculation at least what was (53:46 - 53:51)
it going to be called so as I originally (53:49 - 53:54)
supposed to be called they changed it in (53:51 - 53:56)
Japan - it's called infinity zone in (53:54 - 53:58)
Japan but it was supposed to be called (53:56 - 54:02)
world that down oh yeah it was changed (53:58 - 54:05)
due to the negative connotations due to (54:02 - 54:09)
Cove in nineteen oh yeah I was having a (54:05 - 54:15)
great history in that don't they huh so (54:09 - 54:17)
the English name is darkness ablaze the (54:15 - 54:20)
Japanese name was supposed to be world (54:17 - 54:23)
down but they changed it to infinity (54:20 - 54:24)
zone (54:23 - 54:31)
sure yeah not great right so darkness (54:24 - 54:34)
ablaze will introduce Charizard v-max as (54:31 - 54:36)
the fan-favorite chartered makes its (54:34 - 54:40)
Giganta max form debut in the TCG just (54:36 - 54:41)
like pokemon sword and shield video (54:40 - 54:43)
games in additions trainers will be able (54:41 - 54:45)
to pull more Pokemon from the gala (54:43 - 54:50)
region as Pokemon Vibha max poke such as (54:45 - 54:53)
sent a scourge of Emax and grim snarled (54:50 - 54:55)
vmax of the legendary pokemon (54:53 - 54:59)
aiternative vmax in its unique eterna (54:55 - 55:03)
max form I guess I don't know if was (54:59 - 55:07)
that ever I've stated in the games that (55:03 - 55:09)
that was what its form was called that (55:07 - 55:10)
turned him out his mom I don't know if (55:09 - 55:11)
Lee stated in that games but I've (55:10 - 55:13)
definitely heard that term before today (55:11 - 55:17)
yeah I think it was definitely in the (55:13 - 55:19)
code of the game so definitely the the (55:17 - 55:22)
miners got a a of that I think and I (55:19 - 55:23)
might be wrong I think it might have (55:22 - 55:26)
been mentioned once when it went into (55:23 - 55:28)
its so when you're when you're battling (55:26 - 55:30)
it and it goes into you think it's (55:28 - 55:32)
fainted and then it goes into in turn a (55:30 - 55:34)
max form I think it says it in once (55:32 - 55:36)
since their and then never ever again (55:34 - 55:40)
hmm but I might be wrong (55:36 - 55:42)
so this expansion for the for us will (55:40 - 55:45)
have seven v-max we already know some of (55:42 - 55:48)
them I think this will also include me (55:45 - 55:50)
max Butterfree cuz yeah that didn't come (55:48 - 55:52)
out in the last set it will have (55:50 - 55:57)
fourteen Pokemon V cards plus nine full (55:52 - 56:00)
art Pokemon v-cards seventeen trainer (55:57 - 56:03)
cards for full art supporters three new (56:00 - 56:06)
special energies are you still in the (56:03 - 56:09)
big on collecting the TCG stuff I am (56:06 - 56:12)
Steve still deep end too many cards on (56:09 - 56:17)
my desk Japanese and English I haven't (56:12 - 56:21)
ordered okay I you pulled my leg I (56:17 - 56:26)
ordered a box of infinity zone which I (56:21 - 56:29)
believe comes out June 2nd okay but I (56:26 - 56:33)
did not order volcanion explosion or (56:29 - 56:36)
whatever the last set was called what (56:33 - 56:38)
explosive Walker (56:36 - 56:43)
it's explosive Walker yeah I did not (56:38 - 56:47)
order a box of that okay but I do have a (56:43 - 56:51)
box of infinity zone on my way what does (56:47 - 56:53)
a box consists of how many packs a box (56:51 - 56:58)
is thirty packs of five cards his (56:53 - 57:00)
Japanese packs are five cards English (56:58 - 57:02)
packs or ten (57:00 - 57:04)
I didn't realize Japanese ones were (57:02 - 57:05)
smaller that's not interesting they (57:04 - 57:07)
weren't always right because I used to (57:05 - 57:08)
apply a lot of Japanese cards but this (57:07 - 57:09)
was a long time ago (57:08 - 57:12)
ah and it was the same amount I feel (57:09 - 57:13)
like his English cards in the packs I (57:12 - 57:16)
want to say when they changed the back (57:13 - 57:20)
of the cards which was like 2011 they (57:16 - 57:23)
like changed everything about it a u.s. (57:20 - 57:28)
pack of Pokemon cards is ideally 399 but (57:23 - 57:30)
I feel like recently it's gone up to (57:28 - 57:33)
like four dollars and 20 cents yeah 4:29 (57:30 - 57:38)
usually yeah um so Japanese packs are (57:33 - 57:41)
200 yen which comes to like a dollar (57:38 - 57:44)
eighty yeah so it's the same like value (57:41 - 57:45)
yeah (57:44 - 57:50)
but the more plastic yeah but these sets (57:45 - 57:53)
are significantly smaller and I believe (57:50 - 57:56)
although I don't have the I don't I'm (57:53 - 57:57)
sure there's a source somebody on the (57:56 - 57:59)
Internet in like a 20 minute YouTube (57:57 - 58:02)
video has like calculated the odds but (57:59 - 58:04)
people say that your poll rate is better (58:02 - 58:06)
in the Japanese set but I don't know if (58:04 - 58:08)
it's better because there are less cards (58:06 - 58:11)
so when darkness ablaze comes out there (58:08 - 58:13)
will be over a hundred and eighty five (58:11 - 58:16)
cards in that set but in the Japanese (58:13 - 58:19)
set there's only like a hundred cards (58:16 - 58:22)
isn't that due to the fact that like (58:19 - 58:24)
like in the Japanese there'll be another (58:22 - 58:27)
set that's like 85 cards that the (58:24 - 58:29)
Americans hats put together into one set (58:27 - 58:32)
right so we we didn't get explosive (58:29 - 58:36)
Walker it's a terrible name and we're (58:32 - 58:39)
not good so so with with the last set (58:36 - 58:41)
that came out which was what was it (58:39 - 58:44)
called rebel clash mobile clash was (58:41 - 58:49)
v-max rising plus rebellious clash plus (58:44 - 58:52)
like one other set okay right right (58:49 - 58:54)
so jets the Japanese players get one set (58:52 - 58:57)
every month the English players get one (58:54 - 59:01)
set every three months so they've merged (58:57 - 59:03)
sets together (59:01 - 59:05)
and these sets become very big and (59:03 - 59:08)
seemingly impossible to collect so I (59:05 - 59:10)
bought cash (59:08 - 59:14)
I bought two boxes of VMAX rising and so (59:10 - 59:16)
a box of VMAX rising is like I don't (59:14 - 59:18)
know I think it's I think it's 5000 yen (59:16 - 59:24)
which comes to like 46 dollars and I got (59:18 - 59:29)
every card from that set except one not (59:24 - 59:31)
counting secret rares secret rares are (59:29 - 59:33)
like the shinies of the set but the (59:31 - 59:37)
actual set is pretty much complete Wow (59:33 - 59:39)
and the only one I was missing I think (59:37 - 59:41)
was v-max Rilla boom and I pulled like (59:39 - 59:45)
three v-max sind races instead so yeah (59:41 - 59:50)
that's and one intelligent Elian i have (59:45 - 59:54)
purchased gosh not not any of these sets (59:50 - 59:57)
I did buy a box of sword and shield (59:54 - 60:01)
which is 36 packs of 10 cards so it's 36 (59:57 - 60:01)
packs (60:01 - 60:07)
10 cards each $100 and not even not even (60:01 - 60:10)
close to completing the set with that (60:07 - 60:12)
one box and that was buying a whole box (60:10 - 60:15)
buying two elite trainer boxes buying (60:12 - 60:19)
probably 20 single packs and then buying (60:15 - 60:23)
like a couple of the you know tax (60:19 - 60:25)
tricity VBox or Polti guys to be box (60:23 - 60:27)
which comes with like four packs ah (60:25 - 60:30)
that's not even close to completing the (60:27 - 60:35)
set I have to imagine that see the last (60:30 - 60:36)
time I collected pokemon card I mean I (60:35 - 60:37)
bought a pack here and there I'll buy (60:36 - 60:39)
typically after you show off some really (60:37 - 60:42)
cool full artwork card it gets me all (60:39 - 60:44)
like hyped up to buy more pokemon cards (60:42 - 60:45)
because I don't play the TCG but I do (60:44 - 60:47)
love collecting them from time to tell (60:45 - 60:50)
you it's just over so overwhelming once (60:47 - 60:52)
I start to realize like how many there (60:50 - 60:54)
are to collect like I can't imagine that (60:52 - 60:56)
there is that the percentage of people (60:54 - 60:59)
who buy Pokemon Trading Cards there must (60:56 - 61:02)
be a such a small amount that are like (60:59 - 61:06)
the complete leanness collector for them (61:02 - 61:09)
I feel like just because it's like so (61:06 - 61:12)
hard to come by all of them especially (61:09 - 61:14)
when you have the secret rares now and (61:12 - 61:16)
all of that stuff which like it wasn't a (61:14 - 61:18)
thing back when I was collecting them (61:16 - 61:21)
but this was like 2002 or whatever so (61:18 - 61:25)
yeah the secret rares really really kind (61:21 - 61:28)
of double down on the people who like to (61:25 - 61:31)
collect Chinese except when you're (61:28 - 61:33)
hunting and X&Y for a shiny it doesn't (61:31 - 61:38)
cost you right exactly exactly well (61:33 - 61:39)
they're they're like some secret rares (61:38 - 61:41)
that are like worthless like price wise (61:39 - 61:43)
but you would still want them for your (61:41 - 61:45)
collection like oh I need the secret (61:43 - 61:47)
rare it's like two bucks on troll and (61:45 - 61:50)
toad I'll buy it but when you're doing (61:47 - 61:52)
that for like eight secret rares or you (61:50 - 61:53)
get a secret rare that is pretty (61:52 - 61:56)
expensive like I think what was it was (61:53 - 61:58)
it it was in a Sun and Moon set it might (61:56 - 62:00)
have been like guardians rising or (61:58 - 62:01)
something there's like a secret rare (62:00 - 62:04)
Charizard which is like a reprint of an (62:01 - 62:07)
older Charizard and that's like a $60 (62:04 - 62:09)
card okay and so it's like well I have (62:07 - 62:11)
almost all of sudden moon I'm missing (62:09 - 62:13)
some secret rares I'm missing the secret (62:11 - 62:14)
rare Charizard oh that just happens to (62:13 - 62:16)
be the most expensive card in the set at (62:14 - 62:20)
60 bucks but it's the one I'm missing (62:16 - 62:23)
still cheaper than a box of of packs (62:20 - 62:25)
that's true yeah yeah which won't have (62:23 - 62:29)
it probably but the question is can I (62:25 - 62:31)
buy a box for a hundred bucks and is (62:29 - 62:33)
there enough cards in there that I can (62:31 - 62:36)
sell to make the hundred dollars a pack (62:33 - 62:41)
right and do you sell your cards I I did (62:36 - 62:44)
sell my entire collection (62:41 - 62:48)
before X&Y came out so I had so I (62:44 - 62:52)
collected pretty much from heartgold (62:48 - 62:54)
SoulSilver triumphant triumphant (62:52 - 62:55)
something it was like the last heartgold (62:54 - 62:58)
SoulSilver set and then they moved into (62:55 - 62:59)
black and white so it was black and (62:58 - 63:00)
white and then it was like emerging (62:59 - 63:02)
powers and then that was a really bad (63:00 - 63:04)
set there was a bunch of other black and (63:02 - 63:05)
white sets and then it got into the (63:04 - 63:08)
plasma freeze and plasma storm and (63:05 - 63:13)
plasma whatever and so that was I (63:08 - 63:15)
collected all of that (63:13 - 63:17)
mostly for competitive and when I (63:15 - 63:21)
decided to get out of that and I think I (63:17 - 63:23)
think that was probably time in my life (63:21 - 63:26)
where I was like broke all right sure (63:23 - 63:28)
which is like every day of my life but I (63:26 - 63:32)
ended up selling all those cards to cool (63:28 - 63:35)
stuff Inc for about 750 dollars (63:32 - 63:38)
Wow and then I had two cards that I sold (63:35 - 63:41)
separately to a friend for $100 each so (63:38 - 63:44)
that was so altogether 950 dollars of (63:41 - 63:48)
selling all of that and I probably spent (63:44 - 63:49)
more than that though because like every (63:48 - 63:51)
time I set every three months I spent (63:49 - 63:54)
probably $200 on cards right we get like (63:51 - 63:57)
two boxes that's just I think I think I (63:54 - 64:01)
figured out why you're you're broke yeah (63:57 - 64:01)
that's uh that's intense just doing that (64:01 - 64:07)
like collecting I have I have the entire (64:04 - 64:08)
very first set (64:07 - 64:10)
that's the only thing yeah I still have (64:08 - 64:12)
that and I still have that and I'm not (64:10 - 64:15)
getting rid of that and I because I was (64:12 - 64:17)
heavy into the collecting with the first (64:15 - 64:20)
set that second third I don't know it (64:17 - 64:22)
was like up until like the rocket cards (64:20 - 64:23)
or whatever would they have the little (64:22 - 64:26)
like rocket face on the card it's like a (64:23 - 64:28)
rocket team members oh yeah like a (64:26 - 64:31)
rocket like team rocket's Charizard my (64:28 - 64:33)
Bonnie's Persian yeah it was like then (64:31 - 64:34)
the gym leaders and then there the (64:33 - 64:38)
rocket cards and all that and then I and (64:34 - 64:39)
then yeah and then I stopped collecting (64:38 - 64:41)
so I think it was my first base set (64:39 - 64:47)
jungle fossil rocket and then gym leader (64:41 - 64:48)
I think gym leader might have been the (64:47 - 64:50)
last time that I was like heavily (64:48 - 64:52)
collecting the cards (64:50 - 64:54)
and then since then I've just like here (64:52 - 64:56)
and there I'll buy a few packs or a box (64:54 - 64:59)
of something from time to time if I'm in (64:56 - 65:04)
the mood uh so darkness ablaze comes out (64:59 - 65:07)
August first some plenty of time (65:04 - 65:11)
literally over two months this does (65:07 - 65:13)
bring up one interesting thing though (65:11 - 65:14)
right because this is the first time you (65:13 - 65:17)
can have an eternal Max eternity in any (65:14 - 65:20)
form and so when are they bring into the (65:17 - 65:22)
game please and thank you (65:20 - 65:25)
[Laughter] (65:22 - 65:27)
I don't know if you know this Al but (65:25 - 65:30)
there are two DLCs coming out this year (65:27 - 65:37)
my last bit of news super short super (65:30 - 65:39)
easy there's a ton of new merch on (65:37 - 65:43)
Pokemon Center they brought the mystery (65:39 - 65:45)
dungeon plushies over which are the (65:43 - 65:47)
little blushes with the ribbons around (65:45 - 65:51)
them there is a purple kecleon for (65:47 - 65:53)
mystery dungeon it's not shiny (65:51 - 65:54)
I keep hearing people call this shiny (65:53 - 65:59)
kecleon purple kecleon is not shiny (65:54 - 66:02)
quickly huh it's just the weird color (65:59 - 66:04)
they decided for mystery dungeon (66:02 - 66:08)
I think kecleon has like the only thing (66:04 - 66:10)
that changes in shiny is like it's (66:08 - 66:12)
Charlie Brown stripe changes from like (66:10 - 66:14)
blue to red or red a blue oh there's a (66:12 - 66:17)
purple kecleon in the anime oh yeah (66:14 - 66:19)
that's weird it's just like the (66:17 - 66:22)
Butterfree the ash ashes yeah yeah (66:19 - 66:24)
that's not a shiny Butterfree it's just (66:22 - 66:27)
a pink one right right like the blue (66:24 - 66:30)
magic carpet Magikarp Jim (66:27 - 66:34)
not shining but good-looking (66:30 - 66:34)
they added a bunch of outdoors they (66:35 - 66:39)
added in like an outdoor collection so (66:37 - 66:41)
this features like Pikachu and like a (66:39 - 66:43)
little camping hat and then they (66:41 - 66:46)
introduced a summer collection which (66:43 - 66:47)
it's very weird that these two (66:46 - 66:48)
collections were close together but I'm (66:47 - 66:50)
assuming due to like production delays (66:48 - 66:53)
with merchandise because of probably Co (66:50 - 66:55)
vyd that one was supposed to come out (66:53 - 66:59)
earlier and it didn't but the there's a (66:55 - 67:03)
complete summer collection with an (66:59 - 67:07)
inflatable Lapras pool thing pool (67:03 - 67:09)
floatie if you're into that they're an (67:07 - 67:13)
inflatable flappers pool floaty thing in (67:09 - 67:16)
inquest it's not one of the decoration (67:13 - 67:19)
items oh I think so yeah no I think (67:16 - 67:21)
there's a Lapras pool I think though (67:19 - 67:25)
back that's just there are pokeball (67:21 - 67:29)
beach balls there's a fisherman hat (67:25 - 67:32)
there's a bunch of thin summer hoodies (67:29 - 67:34)
there's water bottles and then for the (67:32 - 67:38)
camping stuff there is like plates and (67:34 - 67:39)
cups (67:38 - 67:43)
there's a cooler there's fanny packs and (67:39 - 67:46)
then there's like flannel because you (67:43 - 67:47)
know when you go camping you wear (67:46 - 67:52)
flannel obviously so yeah a bunch of new (67:47 - 67:54)
stuff on Pokemon Center and that's (67:52 - 67:57)

something it's a little bit different (69:32 - 69:36)
okay I would normally do okay but I (69:33 - 69:38)
thought I'd bring a bit of my own (69:36 - 69:42)
culture to the podcast okay all right so (69:38 - 69:43)
please excuse me if this is dreadful (69:42 - 69:48)
[Laughter] (69:43 - 69:51)
when I wake up well I know I'm gonna be (69:48 - 69:53)
I'm gonna be the man who answers the (69:51 - 70:01)
question of the week for those who (69:53 - 70:03)
aren't aware that is the Proclaimers the (70:01 - 70:06)
beginning of the Proclaimers song 500 (70:03 - 70:08)
miles that was the final song that we (70:06 - 70:11)
played at my wedding for any section (70:08 - 70:13)
that was our final song as a reception (70:11 - 70:16)
all right this is from Brandon with (70:13 - 70:18)
glaring forms coming to raids what are (70:16 - 70:21)
some non canto Pokemon that you would (70:18 - 70:26)
want to get gallery' and forms but okay (70:21 - 70:29)
non canto Pokemon that I'd want as a (70:26 - 70:32)
Clarion form I'd say two of my two (70:29 - 70:37)
favorite Pokemon besides far-fetched our (70:32 - 70:41)
summer goal and a while so it would be (70:37 - 70:43)
really fun to have both of those as (70:41 - 70:46)
valerian types especially because (70:43 - 70:48)
neither of them are wait because smear (70:46 - 70:50)
is not in the game so that would be fun (70:48 - 70:52)
there's my boils button sword and (70:50 - 70:54)
shoulders it my Wiles and sword and (70:52 - 71:00)
shield yeah it is okay but it's like the (70:54 - 71:04)
opposite of sable I think I think sable (71:00 - 71:06)
is exclusive to one mall while exclusive (71:04 - 71:07)
the other I think (71:06 - 71:09)
oh yeah no of course it is because I (71:07 - 71:10)
definitely moved it up (71:09 - 71:12)
to through-through home and put it in my (71:10 - 71:17)
game or at one point a shiny one um yeah (71:12 - 71:21)
I think I think Hariyama would be good I (71:17 - 71:23)
feel like Hariyama deserves a little (71:21 - 71:26)
love they pure hiding pure fighting type (71:23 - 71:29)
or did they like make a fighting fire (71:26 - 71:31)
now they've never made a fighting fire (71:29 - 71:37)
pokemon ever we are the ghoul Aryan I've (71:31 - 71:39)
not looked into this at all but are the (71:37 - 71:41)
gallery' inform pokemon all pokemon that (71:39 - 71:44)
their non glare Ian's form is a single (71:41 - 71:46)
type no cuz slowpoke was psychic water (71:44 - 71:48)
and glare and slowpoke is psychic oh (71:46 - 71:50)
yeah they like flipped it and then (71:48 - 71:53)
corsola was like water rock and it's (71:50 - 71:56)
gallery' inform is just ghost I think (71:53 - 71:57)
okay (71:56 - 72:01)
got it IIE before the game I can kick (71:57 - 72:03)
their before the game came out I really (72:01 - 72:07)
like the idea of a Clarion oh goodness (72:03 - 72:11)
where does name is gone Cal do I had (72:07 - 72:15)
geladen Cal deal but now we have bonito (72:11 - 72:17)
which kind of takes over that so what I (72:15 - 72:18)
was also thinking was I think it'd be (72:17 - 72:20)
really nice to have a goal Aryan (72:18 - 72:23)
lollipop line I'm not sure how you would (72:20 - 72:25)
redesign it but I just really like the (72:23 - 72:27)
idea of that line being associated with (72:25 - 72:30)
what you know the region that is partly (72:27 - 72:34)
based on Scotland um but yeah I do (72:30 - 72:35)
[Music] (72:34 - 72:47)
all right and then you're done that's it (72:35 - 72:50)
all right could there be could there be (72:47 - 72:52)
a Pokemon that you could redesign into a (72:50 - 73:08)
haggis oh boy what just because it's a (72:52 - 73:15)
sheep yeah yes inside out Murray there's (73:08 - 73:18)

mask there they have to say sigilyph (73:21 - 73:26)
they have the scraggy garb order is like (73:23 - 73:30)
the only non gen1 pokemon to get a GMAX (73:26 - 73:34)
form now not counting gen8 pokemon of (73:30 - 73:37)
course oh yeah that is true is it really (73:34 - 73:41)
the only non na janam one or jelly 108 (73:37 - 73:44)
yeah I know how that decision came to be (73:41 - 73:51)
his garb order is sweet okay man there's (73:44 - 73:53)
so many Jen I'm like looking at the list (73:51 - 73:57)

sword and shield is is actually (73:57 - 74:01)
incredible there's no bouffalant though (73:59 - 74:03)

DLC since we initially write like (74:07 - 74:12)
trailer or anything like now I would I (74:10 - 74:13)
would assume or probably get information (74:12 - 74:17)
this week or next week right yeah well (74:13 - 74:19)
tomorrow's June so it's coming out (74:17 - 74:25)
tomorrow right right yeah where's my (74:19 - 74:29)
game it is a bit weird do you think do (74:25 - 74:30)
you think they've just kind of held off (74:29 - 74:32)
on any news because they thought there's (74:30 - 74:35)
a possibility it might be delayed um and (74:32 - 74:37)
they just want they didn't want to say (74:35 - 74:38)
anything until they knew for certain uh (74:37 - 74:41)
well they're still putting out I mean (74:38 - 74:42)
obviously we still have things to talk (74:41 - 74:44)
about every week so they're stopped (74:42 - 74:46)
putting out pretty frequently pretty (74:44 - 74:49)
frequent Pokemon news I wonder if it was (74:46 - 74:52)
because obviously their Japanese company (74:49 - 74:55)
and Japan had a state of emergency that (74:52 - 74:57)
just got lifted this past week so maybe (74:55 - 74:58)
they were waiting for the state of (74:57 - 75:01)
emergency to be over possibly yeah they (74:58 - 75:04)
do have an advantage in unlike a normal (75:01 - 75:07)
game launch they're not relying to on (75:04 - 75:10)
physical media for this one so they (75:07 - 75:13)
don't have my issue yeah that's if (75:10 - 75:15)
there's ever a time yeah but even with (75:13 - 75:18)
the Pikachu Eevee (75:15 - 75:22)
Meowth and now the like get your free (75:18 - 75:26)
mr. mine ponyta corsola Meowth another (75:22 - 75:30)
behalf like I don't think any of these (75:26 - 75:32)
decisions have been last-minute like I (75:30 - 75:34)
think these have always been in the (75:32 - 75:34)
pipeline (75:34 - 75:37)
yeah right and yeah but I guess the (75:34 - 75:40)
decision to delay we would probably be (75:37 - 75:41)
in a last-minute thing (75:40 - 75:44)
if I had to do it no I I think I think (75:41 - 75:46)
we're good (75:44 - 75:47)
the only reason I could think of maybe (75:46 - 75:49)
they didn't want to say a date is if (75:47 - 75:51)
they needed just that extra week not to (75:49 - 75:53)
finish the game I think it's probably (75:51 - 75:55)
done at this point but the extra week of (75:53 - 75:58)
like hey instead of putting it out on (75:55 - 76:01)
June 12th let's just wait two weeks to (75:58 - 76:04)
the 26 just (76:01 - 76:06)
because of world events or because of (76:04 - 76:09)
other things happening so it gives them (76:06 - 76:11)
a little flexibility yeah yeah (76:09 - 76:14)
I do find it interesting that they never (76:11 - 76:17)
have done that for games right so (76:14 - 76:19)
obviously they didn't know when they (76:17 - 76:21)
announced it that this was gonna happen (76:19 - 76:23)
right yeah (76:21 - 76:24)
but they still didn't announce a date at (76:23 - 76:26)
that point where is almost every game (76:24 - 76:29)
maybe not the very first one like there (76:26 - 76:30)
are some times where it's like oh coming (76:29 - 76:33)
holiday or whatever but normally by the (76:30 - 76:36)
second bit of information which is (76:33 - 76:37)
normally only like a month or so later (76:36 - 76:39)
they generally have to date by that (76:37 - 76:41)
point well there's never been a second (76:39 - 76:43)
bit of information to to give us a date (76:41 - 76:46)
a date right there was just like the (76:43 - 76:48)
announcement of it and then there hasn't (76:46 - 76:49)
really been any like newer information (76:48 - 76:52)
there was the announcement and I was (76:49 - 76:55)
like that Nintendo that Nintendo thing (76:52 - 76:59)
where it was like 19 minutes long and it (76:55 - 77:01)
like open with Xenoblade cuz it always (76:59 - 77:02)
opens with Xenoblade and now the (77:01 - 77:04)
Xenoblade Zout will probably get 18 more (77:02 - 77:08)
trailers of Xenoblade this year yeah (77:04 - 77:10)
they definitely had more information in (77:08 - 77:11)
that one because they told us a bit the (77:10 - 77:13)
dojo a mountain and stuff and I don't (77:11 - 77:14)
think that was in the original and yes (77:13 - 77:17)
they said about the dojo and then we saw (77:14 - 77:18)
the slowpoke moving very quickly (77:17 - 77:21)
near the end of the trailer you're right (77:18 - 77:23)
okay I was waiting those together in my (77:21 - 77:26)
hair and then they actually said like in (77:23 - 77:30)
telly in out loud and they said is it (77:26 - 77:32)
Doral Adhan I think they said Doral (77:30 - 77:34)
Adhan out loud here yeah that's right (77:32 - 77:39)
that's how you say so here's something (77:34 - 77:41)
interesting in that I just went to the (77:39 - 77:44)
sword and shield expansion pass page on (77:41 - 77:47)
the website and they now see because I'm (77:44 - 77:48)
pretty sure when they announced that it (77:47 - 77:51)
was June 2020 but now it's share it says (77:48 - 77:54)
scheduled for release by the end of June (77:51 - 77:58)
2020 so like that that was me think that (77:54 - 78:00)
it's gonna be quite late on I think they (77:58 - 78:02)
changed that with the with a slowpoke (78:00 - 78:05)
trailer array okay I think that's just a (78:02 - 78:08)
good like use of that's a good term to (78:05 - 78:10)
just give them by this as time as (78:08 - 78:13)
possible right they could like they (78:10 - 78:15)
could be like it's coming out June 30th (78:13 - 78:17)
you know so it's just (78:15 - 78:20)
then as much time with that June date (78:17 - 78:21)
it's just just the best way to give them (78:20 - 78:23)
as much time as possible although I (78:21 - 78:25)
guess just saying June 2020 would also (78:23 - 78:27)
give them the same amount of time but (78:25 - 78:29)
yeah I guess they're probably putting (78:27 - 78:32)
the focus on by the end of yeah to just (78:29 - 78:34)
give people the expectation it doesn't (78:32 - 78:38)
seem to have worked though was it the (78:34 - 78:39)
15th the most people are assuming at (78:38 - 78:42)
this point because of the (78:39 - 78:47)
I am the mystery gifts so we're looking (78:42 - 78:49)
at just Friday's we have either June 5th (78:47 - 78:54)
June 12th June 19th and June 26 I was (78:49 - 78:56)
going oh that's right huh and yeah so (78:54 - 78:59)
the Meowth event I think starts on the (78:56 - 79:01)
15th and then or now not the 15th I (78:59 - 79:04)
think it starts in the 11th or something (79:01 - 79:06)
goes until the night yeah yeah I think (79:04 - 79:08)
yeah I think ends on the 18th wasn't it (79:06 - 79:12)
was a day before oh right right maybe (79:08 - 79:15)
that could be the plan it's just they (79:12 - 79:16)
also have the option like you're saying (79:15 - 79:18)
earlier if they like get closer to that (79:16 - 79:20)
and realize something's not gonna work (79:18 - 79:21)
or they need to give it maybe another (79:20 - 79:24)
week they still have that like that (79:21 - 79:26)
option since they've said until you know (79:24 - 79:29)
by the end see if it comes out the 19th (79:26 - 79:30)
I'm gonna have a very busy couple of (79:29 - 79:32)
weeks cuz that's only a few days after (79:30 - 79:35)
summer and matter comes a oh it's gonna (79:32 - 79:38)
be so easy I think the 20th is also the (79:35 - 79:40)
wheedle day oh it is you're right yeah (79:38 - 79:43)
of course that means of course they're (79:40 - 79:47)
gonna do then because yeah because (79:43 - 79:50)
sergeant Schultz came out the day before (79:47 - 79:53)
November's which I think was Chimchar (79:50 - 79:57)
community sorry yeah yeah which Tyee (79:53 - 79:59)
they like to have their events all (79:57 - 80:02)
together talking about eventually right (79:59 - 80:05)
al events on events on events events (80:02 - 80:08)
everywhere yeah I'm actually hoping it's (80:05 - 80:10)
the 26 I didn't I don't want another (80:08 - 80:11)
community day slash game launched the (80:10 - 80:15)
same weekend I will yeah I think the end (80:11 - 80:18)
of June is fine I the next weekend goes (80:15 - 80:22)
into Independence Day for America which (80:18 - 80:26)
most people have that Friday off yeah I (80:22 - 80:29)
think that's all else also but good but (80:26 - 80:32)
I always like to think of whenever any (80:29 - 80:34)
announcement says a month (80:32 - 80:36)
I always just in my head I put it right (80:34 - 80:39)
to the last day of that month so that (80:36 - 80:41)
I'm not like I never hype myself up for (80:39 - 80:44)
any time before then and if it comes (80:41 - 80:46)
before then nice little surprise but (80:44 - 80:48)
yeah I would say last day of the month (80:46 - 80:51)
it's like when they say holiday 2020 or (80:48 - 80:52)
wherever you're like yeah that's coming (80:51 - 80:55)
