so [Music] oh what's up everyone welcome to the 407 episode of the pokemon podcast it's super effective i'm your host sbj with me is well wow i get to go first this week doesn't happen that often i'm having a life crisis because on the one hand um i'm sitting here in a plain white t-shirt because i just went to the gym and don't care what i look like on the other hand reviewing fashions of the met gala is giving me life there were some good fashions man matt gala is back i mean i don't really understand what happens at the gala i just want to assume everybody walks up the stairs and then goes out the back and goes it's it's worse than that greg literally this is the secret that the noobs don't know about the met gala and i think lil nas x was trying to clue us in oh yeah but they show up in one outfit costume that is their red carpet outfit slash costumes when they go behind the doors where we can't see them anymore they change into other outfits i for me i'd be like okay i did the thing i go through the doors oh you gotta have every dinner you gotta everybody's done serena williams out there with kim kardashian mixing it up the chance the rapper's in there with his ralph lauren very classic american look steve's just dying here none of these people are on the pokemon 25 album greg is here i am also here greg is also not in the pokemon 25 i am not i should have been i have i had a whole song that was actually pokemon related so whatever they didn't get back to me in time so done we're fine it's also very warm in my house mistakes have been made we're recording this before sunday uh since i'll be out of town this weekend i'll be playing oshawott community day with greg and well i guess i guess that was the unspoken agreement i don't know maybe they could just not show up i guess i mean we'll show up but we're not gonna probably stay as long as you want it's like 94 on sunday well mall america no what is wrong i'm in minnesota it's look past mid-september i want 30s things have happened that are unacceptable and we just have to deal with them for the moment are we talking about mall america or the weather the weather oh okay i feel like that could have applied to mall of america well it always applies to mall of america but that is a well-known problem you know there are other malls here yeah but what other mall has 10 gyms and like all of them like people mark this city up [Music] okay so we got some pokemon news hopefully nothing gets announced friday although a pretty good track record of nothing really getting announced friday they seem to like their thursday tuesday things uh but let's start with since you guys were talking about the met gala which i don't understand what that is um it's a fundraising event it's a fundraiser by anna the aforementioned devil who may or may not wear prada you know look look we know that that is based off of them it's not like it's a secret true also a work of fiction not nonfic don't you wink at me it's a work of fiction uh let's start off the news with the full track list confirmed for the pokemon 25 album [Music] it is scheduled for october 15th this is off the gamer.com what number is phoebe bridgers on that track list zero several tracks have been revealed including a few pokemon themed music videos the album's complete track list is now available uh with katy perry post malone it will also feature well i'll just we'll just go through the whole list we have katy perry electric we know that one yes we've heard that will's going to be our music expert here jax jones phases with synod heronette harnett probably uh we have mabel take it home am i supposed to know who mabel is i'm no uh mabel's up and coming up and coming okay little yaki yeah yeah wait is it little yaki or little yachty maybe yachty y-a-c-h-t-y yeah like the phone yeah they would believe it but look i used to no we're gonna come to my little yaddy we're going on the lake we got jay baldwin with ten wait jay baldwin jay blavin baldwin b-a-l-v-i-n-bulvin we already knew they were on the album though yes yes we have sinn with the song wonderful which we knew got vince staples with the song got him we got him we got this is a new one i think luanne with game girl should i know who luann is i don't i mean unless it's the one from king of the hill no i mean it's they're a french singer and actress so that's about all i know about it all right i would assume that the ones i maybe haven't heard of or like uh hispanic or latino or korean or you know i i'm assuming these are like world worldwide yes it's like when people are like who's bts let's get to rina mushanga come on what number is rina mushanga uh zero tierra whack art show yeah that's pretty whack don't again don't know post malone only want to be with you uh yeah yeahful yeah yeah with rico songs reconnect featuring diace yamamoto and ee me it's all caps it's all caps [Laughter] and then we have three remixes i believe yafel is japanese i'm not 100 i'm not 100 sure on that but i think they're japanese i don't know uh in talking with and talking about working with pokemon and contributing the album little yachty little yashti a little yachty i had this to share quote i've always been a huge pokemon fan and i've jumped out the opportunity beyond the album i love the record i did it for called believe in and i hope it inspires my fans to chase their dreams end quote um target has the physical cd and exclusive poster and stickers uh i believe i don't think you can get the album physically anywhere else i don't even know if best buy sells cds anymore in stores i don't think so they have to way in the back they don't get rid of those things um yeah maybe in the back but uh otherwise every other like purchase was digital it was like amazon music apple music spotify etc so i think if you want a physical album for to put next to your ancient mew [Laughter] i mean here's the thing i i like buying physical commemorative items me too but at this point the only thing that's really pokemon about it is the cover and i'll just download the jpeg and print it out like there you go there's nothing about this album that screams pokemon to me like there's a couple of songs that vaguely reference the series i'll throw it on spotify and listen to it once and then promptly forget this is no to be a master let's be real yeah you know if there's a bop on there that you just haven't realized yet there could be a yeah there could be looking at the list of people on this album i guarantee you i will not find a bop for me what about the secret jukebox the joke the jukebox you know the band i'm talking about jukebox the ghost ghost if they have a hidden track i will buy that track on its own somewhere i'm i mean i'm not one to sit here i'm not a i used to be a big uh music fan when i was younger i kind of don't like when i when i'm listening to things in the shower or the car more than long it's just podcast at this point it's or audio books it's not specifically music i do think it is really cool for a huge company to get a bunch of people together to make an album i think that's sweet i love that concept i'm into it and i'm sure if you love vin staples or you love mabel or you love somebody else on this track this list you're probably somewhat excited and if you're it's probably a decent way to discover a new artist to be like i don't know who luanne is and i really liked game girl as a song i mean i'm going to listen to it once but i'm i'm feel like i'm in that phase that i'm not looking for new artists i mean my wife puts on music that's cool if i'm in a friend's car and they put on music cool but like i'm in this you know your wife only listens to three bands she she's there's a lot bts fall out boy panic at the disco okay first off it's bts fall out boy txt i don't think panic at the disco is even in top top 20. i don't know what tvxt is i don't know that yeah i mean i am always for new artists like and it what i still sort of take a little bit of side eye towards this is you can discover these new artists and there's music and still have it's much more strongly tied to pokemon for a pokemon album that is the main issue right it does just feel like a bunch of people who are willing to to get on the pokemon money train with minimal effort i i would uh hope slash assume that the people here are the people who like we're excited to be on it like i know some people are like oh well katy perry maybe doesn't like pokemon but i don't maybe i don't know maybe she does it's hard to tell how genuine somebody is or maybe they did ask people maybe they did ask like i don't know jay-z or bts or shakira hey do you want to be on this and they're like nah pokemon's wack no thanks because jay-z is going to lower himself to make a pokemon track yeah i mean it's just however they got involved it i just it it it bothers me a little bit that's all yeah uh i mean i'll get the target version i guess and then listen to it on spotify for i'll come to your house and steal it if they really we should have to listen let's have a listening party okay oh god get d monetized on youtube instantly i mean we'll just have it we'll just have it muted and tell everybody go to spotify play it at your home and then you can see our reactions live we will count down everything we'll do everybody here everybody hit play and then you'll know which one we're on there is a way there is a there is a twitch person that i know that has somehow has their spotify song list attached to their stream so like if you go you're listening to the exact same thing that i know what i'm talking about there's a way to do that and i don't know how there is a way there's a way i don't know how to do it i don't know anything about twitch but we could do that and listen live we could have a 500 subscriber will and steve and i sit in the room and listen to this terrible album for your interview i feel like the three of us have drastic music differences yeah that's what makes it interesting like although will will will is a pop princess through and through you like your thoughts will has definitely suggested me music back when we were both younger and i i really enjoyed the music that will suggested [Music] i listen to a broad range yeah but you listen to more pop than i do i i do enjoy sweetie yes and little not that oh [ __ ] they had a mcdonald's meal don't even how dare you i only get my music through mcdonald's drive-through oh bps oh so wheaty okay hopefully you know maybe next week what happened to me are you sure you don't know what happened to me is this about sweet should we do we save this for the premium podcast somebody hacked my grub hub oh that's right i ordered 45. mcdonald's to be delivered to and i'm not kidding you the delivery instructions said the parking lot of the elementary school and they ordered the sweetie meal and i was like how dare you hack my account i don't get the sowetie meal you come into my house you hack my account for my star and you don't even say deliver it to whales is one of my top songs i listen to that every single day i love sweetie do you know she's uh filipino and black little known fact about sweetie right there i didn't acknowledge i don't know who that is period she had a meal at mcdonald's greg come on i have not eaten that mcdonald's since 1991 t minus 60 days until i'm there and we're going through mcdonald's you can go through mcdonald's and do whatever you want i will stare at you with the disgust that i'm staring at you with now do you think uh let's let's hit the pokemon go news early in the episode [Music] is the pokemon fashion week and the met gala was that uh that gala is part of new york fashion week yeah oh so this is probably somewhat planned yes yeah i don't know that would be a really big coincidence if they're like hey it's fashion week and pokemon go and it just happened everybody specifically said they were tying it to new york fashion week yeah i don't i have the press release here i don't think they use the words new york um but uh well this is off pokemongolive.com furforu and costume pokemons frolic into pokemon go fashion week for for the poodle pokemon i don't know dog types i don't okay is making it those are tea cup poodles not standard poodles standard poodles are turtles are big they didn't know this i thought poodle was just the that's a toy tiny that's a toy there's teacup toy and standard there might be one in between i did not know this uh many forms keep an eye out for stylish dress pokemon in the wild and in raids along with new avatar items uh celebrate the event with the sh with the in celebration of the event i know how to read the shop will be having the first of its kind sale on select avatar items finally you can get those boots that clip through your pants and socks and i get socks they have two pairs of socks socks how many socks will we get none uh don't if you need socks pokemon unite is there for you september 21st through september 28th is this event fur fruit will make its debut some forms will be available in certain regions around the world please reference the bottom to okay we'll go through it natural form that's just the white fur fruit is available globally matra matt matron trim also available globally dandy trim of it i thought that's a daddy trim available globally uh debutante yeah times deputy i was almost there you're very good uh available in america's diamond trim available in europe middle east and africa star trim available in asia pacific la renee trim available in france no lauren lauren you that was very romantic coming out of your mouth i spoke french for a lot of my life uh kabuki trim available in japan pharaoh trim available in egypt and heart trim that's what this is gonna be valentine's day right like they're gonna save heart trim for valentine's day uh i suppose cause like once it's introduced it's there forever right like this is now no they're gonna do something where it's like you can only do it this week and then they're gonna take it away from you i mean i guess here's the thing in the games you could like get a haircut and go into any of these things are we going to be able to get haircut tickets in this game and just change it to whatever form we want no they already said that you got to catch it the one that it is right no no no i will get they explain how this works to all our listeners also confused we'll get there look forward to pokemon like butterfree sneasel blitzel wearing fashionable items for the first time costume pokemon that was during last year's fashion week was smoochum curlier shanks krogan they will return the next part of the season of mischief special research story uh will unlock so you can help professor willow study ferfrew complete the special research to uh encounter the beautifully voiced meloeda this is for people who didn't go to go fest because we already got mellowetta them out now mellowetta's gonna be available for everyone that was fast yeah they didn't they didn't wait a year yeah they never do it's always like two or three months after i felt like celebi was like six months i felt like celebrity was at least half a year fashionable trainers with fashionable pokemon will be appearing more at pokestops complete timed research um starting on monday fashion avatars like hoopa's bangles will appear in the shop certain avatar items will be on sale for fruit will appear in the wild as long as with curlya blitzel krogunk if you're lucky you may encounter a butterfree costume pokemon like sneasel and shanks will appear in raids costume pokemon like butterfree and curlia will appear in three star raids um the pokemon appearing in five star raids and megas will not change from what was announced i don't remember what was announced but those are not changing uh alolan meowth gallery meowth spoochum fashionable costume and shinks in a costume will appear in 7k eggs if you're lucky trainers shiny butterfree shiny sneezel shiny smoochum shiny curlier shiny shanks shiny krogan shiny blitzel all wearing fashionable costumes uh you may encounter a shiny blitzel without a costume after fashion week is concluded you won't see blitzel very often in the wild well well i mean thanks for letting us know at least get wrecked catch it now communication slightly better i guess on that one okay this is how the form thing works when you see it for free you catch it it will always be the natural trim you can then select the form change button available in the menu it's under the power up button where the evolve button would be and for 25 candy and 10 000 stardust you can change it to a form based on your region so you could catch a fur fruit in america travel to egypt and then change it to pharaoh form and then when you came back to america it would still be feral form i don't think what we know and i don't think they say is if you trade it will it stay because in the main series games i believe once you put fur fur in your box the trim goes away correct it does not stay but it was so easy to change the it was easy to change but it's not easy to change the pokemon go i can't fly to france to get the ren not with that also don't have klefki um what this is fine i don't know if somebody's there might be somebody i'm sure there's somebody complaining that these form changes like who's who cares it's not like for fruit gets better if it has the star skin or the skin beg to differ appearance is everything i do like the i do like regionals i get there an inconvenience for people that are like wanting to complete the entire collection i do like the concept of hey my friend like like in my head and i i would assume maybe niantic probably thought this when they thought of it but it it goes back to the core system of red and blue right i can't get manky you can't get sandshrew yes you finally meet somebody they trade you so before they did all these canto events where they moved kangaskhan into braids which they've done what three times now and they put in eggs twice now like seeing my friend mark for the first time and then him trading kangaskhan to me at my wedding was like a cool moment that was the best memory from your entire wedding yeah getting the king it was actually a chat uh because he did kangaskhan i think the first day and then chat the second day um and i think those memories are cool and i think that's kind of you know pokemon go or main series game or just the series as a whole like that is something that they aim to do like create those specific types of memories so i like regionals in that aspect i think regionals that probably appeal to everyone a little bit more something like shellos where it's like i don't have the pink one or i don't have the blue one but it doesn't matter they're exactly the same it's like yeah you're missing one of them but it's not like you're like tr tropius is a problem because tropius is exclusive to africa tropius is good in gbl so like that is a problem pokemon whereas like furfur is going to be available everywhere and your form is based on your location so it'd be cool if like you know the three of us go to japan and we're like ah we we're saving up for fruit to change and then we come back like that's cool moment but also like the japanese fur fruit isn't stronger than the daddy for fruit please don't please don't encourage the children uh so i think that for i i would also uh guess is this is how you're gonna change hoopa or meloetta those are two pokemon with forms you probably have to gonna spend stardust slash i mean hoopa is evolved is based on an actual item like you have to have that bottle to make it uh yeah but that hasn't worked with other pokemon and pokemon go so they're just yeah anything roll the dice are they gonna retro do this for cast form like i don't know yes like if you want your cast form to be rainy you gotta wait for it to be rainy then hit the button you can change it well they i mean some stuff and go like um the machamp and the alakazam and all that's like when you trade they're they're free yeah they do trade they added they added trade evolutions yeah they could add it i mean i could see them saying hey if you have a regular cast form you can spend way too much stardust like ten thousand ten thousands a lot to make make a water cast form maybe they'll drop it to one that you can get naturally like it'll be a thousand and like one candy i feel like stardust just in general i get the game is grindy but man what a bad currency like like i have four million stardust right now okay all you got maybe i don't have that much i could maybe power up like what six pokemon and then i'm out i guess kind of i don't know it's time for stardust check i don't know if i played pogo today i don't think i logged in today the night is still young it's only 8 o'clock yeah how do you get your first catch of the day i usually get it like right before midnight hey the pokemon 5th anniversary video is here i just saw okay start us check uh seven million fifty nine thousand forty eight i spent a lot recently i'm only at one point eight mil where's the easiest place to see this just tap into the not a pokedex the your your bag now i gotta check the spiro oh yeah i have one million stardust there you go all amateurs i don't think you have ever spent any stardust will that's that is not true i have traded pokemon force you to trade and i have powered up pokemon for research tasks oh hey i have enough omega candy to evolve obama snow oh yeah this weekend grass is super effective against water you would probably want to make a vault of water pokemon though to get that bonus oh i might do gyarados this weekend yeah you're giving out six strats the day after yeah that's true yeah you're right yeah it was a wonderful oshawa it was a wonderful oshawa day we had very much fun um we did the track lists we did pogo we have three more news articles this one we'll do and then we'll take a break and then we'll do the other two but i think we're getting to a point where it's maybe safe to buy the cookies this is off eater.com after weeks of picketing the nabisco workers strike might come to an end i don't think we have to spend a lot of time on this but they have they have reached a tentative agreement with the mandela's mondelez international regarding its new contract if you guys don't know this nabisco they make oreos chips ahoys ritz um not the best company in the world not not close to maybe a decent company look they're not nestle all right at least they're not nestled i mean this is not a lot of things but yes large corporations in general ain't great so you might have saw on social media don't buy anything nabisco including pokemon oreos because this strike is happening uh it seems that they're coming to an agreement so i don't know on monday if the agreement will be settled uh this they've reached this on september 16th at about 10 a.m um and it's now 8 p.m and that we haven't really heard anything from it but i mean this this takes time yeah like they've they've the the representatives have come to a contract that both sides think are good and then they have to take it to their workers and say will you accept this and the workers can still say no and then they go back to the drawing go back but generally if the union representatives come up with a contract that they think is agreeable generally the masses are fine with it but it does take time because they do have to take it back to everybody and say okay yes no except contract deny contract yeah uh i got sent pokemon cookies i got sent a pack i haven't opened i haven't even remembered the box so the other people were trying to sell these cookies on ebay i don't want to buy cookies off of ebay i don't know what you did to my cookies ebay person ebay weirdo i don't know what you do with your life i ain't buying your cookie agreed 100 sketch sketchy ebay cookies are a no-go this happened with the lady gaga cookies too they also went up on ebay and i still wouldn't buy them i don't think anyone should be buying cookies on ebay yes you do you're an ebay person you were right now thinking should i put these pokemon oreo cookies i have i can't even i don't even think i've ever sold the pokemon item on ebay i have sold like iphones on ebay this sounds like i've never sold a tcg card on ebay no i like it's just easier to sell tcg cards to like just a card shop you get like probably less but i want to send one package of like 7 000 cards and i wanted to be over with it i will take the less money for the convenience of not individually packing and shipping cards that's not a business i want to be in uh not with that attitude i ain't got time for that ebay is a very time consuming uh not hobbies of some people's jobs it's a job it's a time-consuming job that pays a variable amount don't buy oreo cookies off ebay don't buy the food off ebay i've seen people buy ancient cereal and then eat said ancient syrup from the 80s and stop watching those youtube channels encouraging them don't know how did you get to the point where you're you're watching people eat old food okay my youtube algorithm has been infected by will because the other day a bunch of extreme mountain biking videos showed up and of course my fault i've watched them and now i have a bunch more and i'm like this is will's fault how i've never touched your youtube will mentioned bikes in front of my phone and now i have constant youtubes about bikes you looked up something you shouldn't have been looking at buddy do you own a mountain bike yet greg what do you own a mountain bike yet no also i've somehow gotten onto weird farming youtube because i'm getting a lot of cow hoof trimming videos for no reason which is appealing to my husband and i looked at him and he said i have not touched your youtube i don't know what's going on with my youtube somehow it's will and steve's fault though i'm pretty sure that's fair it's not fair all right let's take a break when we come back we're going to talk about some uh pokemon art and pokemon a masters we will be right back get uhaul to drive the utah that seems expensive though i feel like it's just way cheaper to fly a friend in mid oh shiny turtle does it have a mark is this marked uh wait hold on i'm not supposed to punch it uh let's chew those and we are back from our break so there was a big tcg teasing teasement an advertisement they they teased a new client and did the new client come are they making 3d cards oh wait oh you mean tcg online uh i can't remember i think this was like a twitter thing of like look forward to some tcg news next week and here it is off pokemon.com make art compete in a pokemon tcg illustration

can't charizard surprising everybody pikachu arcanine gallerian rapidash greninja and for whatever reason and this doesn't make sense cramer ant i am not lying bumped squirtle they bumped they bumped cramer ant you have poisoned the whole everything with your love we're getting so close to kramer and pokemon go i can taste it i mean i look at this list and i literally had to click off it and go back to it to verify that this wasn't a fake website that steve made i think scissors is actually the weird one here ah people like caesar yeah nobody likes crime rant well one person likes one person likes uh i thought they would have all of the starters do we do we now have the three-hour debate about how it's wrong for companies to have art contests and blah blah blah that was the hill i wanted to die we're all dying on that hill this is a bad idea i hate when they do this i hate when they do this too okay so give us your free hard work and you might get five thousand dollars yeah fyi in the hidden print we own your artwork once you send it into us i don't know how a company does this correctly no i do know how they found it they found an artist in the uk and they paid her to make a bedof print and there was no competition yeah like i totally understand the perspective of we have a bunch of people that love pokemon and they make art for it non-stop and they do that because that's a passion or a hobby or their career is art or they they're just get i i get that i get that people are gonna make pokemon art regardless but i just hate the like billion dollar company give us free art we will judge you at the end of it we own your art and 99.9 percent of people that participate will probably be severely disappointed yep well life is disappointment so there are some artists that are that are probably like i don't care i i make a bulbasaur image every saturday night i'm just gonna spend this saturday night to send it into this yep but there there is at least a handful of people out there that legitimately think they're gonna win and they're going to be and that's that's on them i guess then they're going to be devastated when they don't win the thing that bothers me the most about this is this company the pokemon company these pokemon companies they can't even do good by contest let me remind you all from 2019 off kotaku pokemon t-shirt contest winner disqualified oh right about that pulled from upcoming game this like i think if they would have handled the situation better this announcement to me wouldn't feel so salty or like here's just another billion dollar company getting free art from people because they handled this so poorly so i'm gonna we're gonna go we talked about this on the podcast this is like two years ago now this is a long time ago and i completely forgot about it so a japanese clothing company unique leo or how do you ever say it uniqlo uniqlo announced that a chinese artist lee wen pai won the ut grand prix pre for contest for designing a pokemon t-shirt uh lee was going to win 10 000 and to have their design featured in pokemon sword and shield set to come out the switch later this year they were disqualified because they didn't adhere to the rules now that's fair that's like them not following the rules getting disqualified that that's not the problem i have with this um so the japanese global apparel retailer announced that they disqualified the grand prize winner another finalist uh in its pokemon themed grand prix after learning that the designs and questions were not accordance to the terms you the no grand prize will be given to uh will be awarded or given to another entrant at all uh the design was it was a it was a gyarados and then it was like three more magic carp underneath it was called ocean king it was very it's a good shirt it's a very good shirt really good design so the reason it was disqualified they say possible reason here but we've obviously two years have passed we know why it's disqualified is because they initially didn't make the design for this so one of the rules was your design could not exist anywhere it had to be solely for this this is part of the pokemon now owns your artwork thing well it had it couldn't have been used for commercial purposes elsewhere like you could have posted it but no you were not allowed to post it that was one of the rules oh okay but they yeah they were like you're not allowed to show off the design it was i but they like made a like an iphone case and they sold like two of them with it which probably wouldn't have mattered or gotten caught but another company stole that design and manufactured a bunch of those cases and that's why it got caught so the the problem i have with this and why i i don't like this tcg thing is because of how they handled it they pulled the prize and they pulled the shirt from it was supposed to be a shirt you could buy irl and a shirt you could buy in the game why did they not just give this to the second prize winner why did they not draw a new third like okay second prize winner you are now here's your ten thousand dollars your shirt is in the game your shirt will be on store shelves like i how did the second and third players prize winners feel that not only did they come in second and third they got nothing yeah they got nothing and see it's a very cultural thing because if you're not first you're not first and us as players we didn't even get a shirt in the game no at all we couldn't like why what happened around shirtless the whole time so cold in those snowy sections i think i think they handled it very poorly i don't know what you guys think but i i i agree i don't know why they wouldn't have gone to the second at least given the second person the prize money yeah like i can give the second person the shirt in the game maybe they had already coded the game or like we can't switch that that i think that's what we were speculating at that point yeah like we can't switch the shirt because it's already too late whatever and unique a little bit like we already ordered a bunch of these shirts and we can't stop it to hit whatever like i there are probably business reasons why they couldn't undo that shirt decision depending on when they caught it but give the prize money like pay the people i'm so scared this is gonna happen again with this tcg they're gonna pick a winner and they're gonna be like oh this existed on your deviantart for the last five years you're disqualified no tcg cards for everyone like yeah it's weird although on the illustrator sheet uh reference sheet you do get creme rent booties so it is worth it for that because they show poses because you're supposed to draw all the things in various forms so they give you multi poses and you get to see the booty of every they do a 3d model oh i see the theme in references yeah i put it in chat yes um i don't i don't i never like when companies do these i hate it all right when we thought that leon was the bait in pokemon masters well he was the bait he wasn't the bait he was the thing he was the contest winner and you all thought oh there's something better coming and there wasn't and they gave us they gave us lily and lunala in a very pretty dress they gave us steven stone and shiny rayquaza and they gave us it's mega mega rayquaza ribbon n and restaurant yes three very popular characters three debatable but i thought very good outfits um and those were actually the bait too the double bait now they have announced red and snorlax and blue and aerodactyl in pokemon masters ex red and snorlax already in the game as of now by the time this podcast goes up blue and aerodactyl should be in the game too um snorlax has the gigantomax ability so this is our second gigantimax right i mean and then blue has the mega aerodactyl to everyone saying mangoes are dead they they're not they've existed pokemon masters and pokemon go uh i didn't really think about this that they can just take characters that already exist re-release them again put the word classic next to it and people lose their minds oh and uh uh giovanni and mega mewtwo and the instead of the black suit he's wearing a white suit when he exes so we're not getting rainbow rocket no he's always so that was a that was a mistake on our part he's always had the rainbow rocket patch um greg what do you what are you thinking these aren't they don't it's they're nothing it's like they're cool no they're not i already have red i already have two blue now you can have a third blue or what with aerodactyl uh no there's already a better rock type there's like normal types are nothing and and i would be excited if gigantomax starlax changed on screen but we learned we don't he does uh gmax replenish or whatever yeah but i don't think the icon's gonna change because it didn't change for eternities so it's just gonna be the move you're going to see it briefly in an animation and then nothing like this is not everybody's like oh they're not even interesting outfits there's classic outfits not interesting outfits classic not interesting classic coke was only better because new coke was so bad the i will say though you know some people obviously the the appeal of the masters is like gravitating towards characters you like some people love blue some love red some love lily some love marnie obviously you know if you don't care about n you're probably not gonna well we learned that a lot of people don't care about ingo and emmett at least in america but some people did um there this is a good anniversary though they kind of knocked it out of the park with with everything they did in my opinion like all of the returning events these two characters the other three characters the leon to lead up like two years into this game and it they feel just as confident as ever and it kind of like to me we went into the two-year on this show and we were like what could they even do and they did a lot i mean they did a lot i mean bringing i would argue they didn't do anything surprising really uh the anniversary pairs were good that event was just a standard event bringing back all the other events is what pretty much every gadget game does it's like hey it's two years here's all the things you missed because you're gonna get new players coming in like it was it wasn't september 500 free polls as well it wasn't surprising to me that they did that like they didn't break the mold of what any other gadget game has done dragalia lost in a hundred free polls for their two year anniversary a bunch of them do it um that's to say there's they took all the good things that everybody does for anniversaries and did them which is great like it got a lot of people excited it was fun but i can't point to a thing that i'm like this was a brand new take i've never seen this done before in these types of games it they did they hit all the things they needed to hit it excited a bunch of new players they introduced a few good pairs sexy leon is here and that was the best thing but that was a up lead up to the anniversary um but like i expected for the two anniversary like more gigantic things to come in like this was your time to do it in that event and it's a little weird that they're doing it after because everybody was going through the three pairs like these are super powerful pairs and now it's after and it feels a little well if you want these spend money uh because we gave you all of this stuff for free mm-hmm yeah i mean they come on you know give it back they did you have a lot of gems though too i don't know how many gems they give compared to last year though i'm sure somebody probably caught that but yeah i mean i think it was more uh because the one year anniversary was not spectacular no i think this anniversary is better than the one year honestly yeah this central issue is better but they had they learned a lot um that said i think there is still i think there's still way too many currencies in this game yeah still way too many currencies like the promise of the units didn't necessarily pan out in game uh so i think they're for hardcore people there are a number of stumbles uh but but for new people for what they want for to get new people in and get new people up to speed to play the game it was very successful but it also was not groundbreaking yeah i can't i can't speak as a hardcore player i mean i play 10 to 15 minutes every day and i feel like there's more than enough for me to do um when i log in and it's a little bit overwhelming honestly uh with like oh we have these new egg events with shiny dratini and we have all these villains and it's like i missed three of the villains but i'm gonna focus on one and then we have this we have uh what that we had the like uh the squirtle bulbasaur pikachu or squirtle bulbs for charmander thing and then the other anniversary things there's a lot there's a lot to do and um and it wasn't clear what was gonna cost eminem what didn't so that was always like what i mean i didn't have the problem because i don't spend all my stamina so i i would do all the one-offs to make sure that i hit them and then whatever was left i just burned it on like misty or yeah whatever the three event content yeah misty was a new free character hop was a new free character yeah i mean so they i think the biggest thing that i don't i'm kind of confused as to what masters wants to be now because they feel like they are shifting towards a character collection game and less towards uh any other type of game like they keep coming out with pairs they are doubling up on pairs pairs that you can't use with each other like i can't pick snorlax red and charizard charizard red like i can't do that so that that sort of weird limitation those weird things are happening where it it is shifting away from like a strategy figure out these puzzles do this thing too spend money to collect the characters that you like because you aren't going to be able to use all of them anyways and so it is now really feeling like a much more of a pure collection game and especially as they keep pushing these egg events because eggs are bad like there's just nothing definitely right you're like bad to use they're bad to use they're funny though they are just a collection event and like the game is really becoming just a collection game and i'm not so sure that i'm interested in that because just collecting means just give us money because yeah i can see that as somebody who like i do like to just collect one for every unit um and i i i very rarely do those hardcore events those like really hard ones but i've done a couple and and when when you do it it feels great like oh gosh i finally got this cool um yeah i don't i don't know what i i am coming from a place where i've never played another gotcha game so i don't know what the end stuff looks like there is no end to gotcha games there's no way no no no no no no i mean like you know you you have all these powerful pairs and you're doing these things but what else are you doing um yeah but i would wager to guess that's a small part of their market is doing that hard stuff yeah i mean i don't think i think it's where they appea i think that's where they get their whales right like right they the people who want to do the hard car content are the people that pay a lot of money into that game and i think that i think with the changes that they're making to masters i think that section is going to start shrinking because they haven't really come up with new really hard things to do in a bit like this event had one but the other ones really didn't yeah um champions castle has pretty much remained the same i think this is the first time they may have rotated the pokemon and i haven't looked well they finally updated the login bonus after two years and it's more appropriate yeah um battle via stays the same uh they just cycle through battling the same legendaries which is like if you know the trick to get it it's just a free like if you already had units to defeat the hard part it's not like when they bring it back that has radically altered it's the same is the same fight yeah so it's like i don't know i don't know what their vision is going forward other than it's now just a collection game and that that is not an exciting thing for me because at some point especially now we have like five banners going on where it's like i don't want to pull on any of these because i feel like choosing one means i have no chance of getting the others and i have to just come to terms with not collecting them and if i if i'm not collecting units what am i doing in this game having fun pokemon battles oh no you said it to auto battle so i guess not i mean i i don't auto battle all the way up to the top but once i beat the hardest thing i'm not going to do that fight 50 times yeah i mean without auto battle on like that's not grinding that way is not fun there's a challenge of so you only get auto battle on if you can defeat it without losing a unit yeah so that's like the that's like the trick and doing that to get better is well one depending on your units but also when you do do it it feels good but it's not going to feel as good the second time that's what you use let's skip the game yeah that's why you use the skip tickets and it's like again they've made a lot of quality of life improvements i just don't see anything like super exciting gameplay wise on the horizon and i was really hoping that dynamaxx would be a super exciting addition and it's just another sync move and that's just been sort of a letdown of how they incorporated that because they just feel like z moves instead of gigantic z moves and megas all already felt the same prior yeah at least megas change they change their actual four move set a lot of the time so like when you mega evolved i don't remember which one like male girls was a good one a bunch of them changed the moves change yeah but with dynamaxx nothing changes it is just basically a z move well snorlax changes you have two new moves after oh does it yeah oh okay if you watched there they did like a 15 second instagram thing and they showed that like when you had two different options after you gigantimaxed does the [Music] picture change does it stay in that form or does it go back to snorlax so it was a 15 second trailer and 10 of it was the animation of it doing its thing so i'm not 100 sure on that i have not pulled on these new characters yet i mean i'm out of coins so i think they're gone we get like bonus on the 18th or something for retweets yeah there's like a retweet bonus we're gonna get there's a retweet bonus but i don't know i don't care about these units okay question of the week oh what okay hold on two news i was just like i'm used to we're at the 40 minute mark when we do this and it's only the 30 minute mark well you know i'm traveling can't have a superhero all right time to ask the question of the week the question of the week uh also shout out to chris for the fur fruit news and jameson and some pokemon center with the houses we'll talk about that next time halloween houses oh they're so bad yeah they're not great um all right this one is from stuart best fur fruit style none of them poodles are horrible dogs if i never see another poodle in my life i will never forget the amount of time i suffered with the poodle that i did previously have in my life they're horrible dogs they're not the the problem is and like this is the the misunderstanding that people have number one they're huge like a standard yes number two it is a water dog so if you're not giving it an opportunity to swim you've got an unhappy poodle number three when they're youthful they're still huge and they jump all over the place and you have to groom them and that's not pleasant yes you do you do need to trim them anyways debutant form is my choice it is a great form oh that's the yellow one yeah it's also got a cute hat a cute southern hat out of the plantation i like diamond i think the most i'm looking i'm looking pharaoh is pretty good i'll go with dandy because i like the hat yeah dandy is also excellent oh dandy's good too yeah i'm going to say diamond i'm going to say diamond all right uh get that branding for shining diamond apparel up there uh and then uh off our youtube this is from uh w lord what is will knitting we already went through that we've mentioned this many times it's a blanket it is a blanket for who the the destination unknown okay maybe it's just for me uh raymond from youtube says what do you think of the vibrant pokey tunes available on youtube and why don't you talk or comment about them last three episodes were so much fun why don't they produce fully animated series like this at this level uh i mean i have watched them they are very much fun they aren't in english which is something why we haven't really talked about them about i've never even heard of whatever they're they're exclusive the japanese right um youtube channel that's why you're getting those they're like done in the old like mickey mouse style ah [Music] they have been very i mean they've been very good and even i think they've now added the english sub titles i think they've added in but and if you don't understand japanese like i do not uh you can get enough context clues to know what's going on and they're super cute like they're really well done they are very cute very well done um from my experience the reason we don't focus too much on like the animation stuff on the show uh is like that the timing of it always just feels off where like we'll talk we we could talk about it like we did this we tried this with the um was it evolutions generations generations where we were covering it every week and it just it just felt like 10 to 15 dead minutes well it's hard to talk about a visual medium that's in an audience like you don't know what we're looking at and i mean it'd be it would be more useful to be like okay we're setting aside a streaming night to everybody hit play together and we'll talk about it then to see like oh hopefully you watch this if not pause everything go watch this for 15 minutes then come back and see what we're talking about right because it's like it's because it's not news right so we're like describing something that you have to watch so like that is just better youtube content than podcast content and it's like well the show's on youtube that's why i commented like totally get that yeah but like the majority of our listeners are audio only so it's just it's just it's always been weird in podcast form um i mean i will say they have they're very good they are enjoyable well done the art styles are great i would highly suggest watching them especially now that you can get english subtitles ah uh watch them they're super charming but i don't know what else to say beyond that like yeah i think that i i think it's it's what i plan to do with the next the rest of evolutions is just kind of do those youtube reactions and it would probably be good for that um yeah because like like i said we've kind of done that stuff in the past and it just doesn't it feels like it really falls flat um podcast audio only wise it feels very much because it's so visual uh but that's a good question super good question uh will pokemon of the week all right last week's pokemon all you need number one i said the japanese name of the pokemon in the clue so all you needed was a little effort towards bulbapedia where they list the japanese names of the pokemon and you would have gotten it but i also used other japanese words including the word for cooking the word for water the word for ice and i also said make sure to check for a pearl in the shell before serving so who's that pokemon it's cloister oh [Laughter] gotcha got him got him i had to be wrong right it's cloistered it's cloister oh wait it is yes i thought it was clam pearl that's why i said kleister here for all of you clamped her eyes there's only one clam that is water ice and that is cloister this is such a train wreck ah yes i was just like how dare you pick something safe like munchlax well i was like oh steve was close it was clam for almost okay i had the clamp roll page open i was about to read its trivia well you were wrong i mean at least he was wrong in some way just not oh my gosh cloister is tied with mega slobro for the highest defense of all water type pokemon slobro's tail has an attached shelter which engulfs it during mega evolution they may have intended this parallel cloister and its pre-evolution share the same category with clam pearl they're all known as the bivalve pokemon uh good shiny enclosure very good shiny uh also a pretty good shuffle like it's rare that they do the entire pokemon as the shuffle icon yeah it's good but it's very roundy it's good all right next week next week here are some of the least relevant facts about this week's pokemon it occupies spot number zero zero one in the coastal calos pokedex it is in the amorphous egg group which it shares with its cousin mistreats but doesn't share with its other cousins it has a fluctuating leveling rate meaning that between levels it sometimes requires more sometimes less xp to level up it has no footprint only hands it made an npc appearance in the pokemon stadium 2 stage of super smash brothers brawl humidity and a dense clustering of souls give rise to this pokemon it either tries to befriend or abduct children in new pokemon snap due to the lack of available children it is seen trying to carry another pokemon last clue it is one of the hat wearing pokemon there you go far froo for a fruit it's nothing to do with humidity except that it gets poofy all right uh sorry for a little bit of shorter episode this week i'm just traveling so editing getting everything up before i leave on a trip so i don't have to do it when i get back but i think we covered all the news anyways this week uh
