well-known problem you know there are (3:23 - 3:27)

don't know (7:19 - 7:23)
uh in talking with and talking about (7:21 - 7:25)
working with pokemon and contributing (7:23 - 7:28)
the album little yachty (7:25 - 7:31)
little yashti a little yachty (7:28 - 7:33)
i had this to share quote (7:31 - 7:35)
i've always been a huge pokemon fan and (7:33 - 7:37)
i've jumped out the opportunity beyond (7:35 - 7:40)
the album i love the record i did it for (7:37 - 7:42)
called believe in (7:40 - 7:44)
and i hope it inspires my fans to chase (7:42 - 7:48)
their dreams end quote (7:44 - 7:48)
um (7:48 - 7:50)
target has the physical cd (7:57 - 8:05)
and exclusive poster and stickers (8:01 - 8:07)
uh i believe i don't think you can get (8:05 - 8:09)
the album physically anywhere else i (8:07 - 8:11)
don't even know if best buy sells cds (8:09 - 8:13)
anymore in stores i don't think so they (8:11 - 8:15)
have to way in the back they don't get (8:13 - 8:17)
rid of those things (8:15 - 8:19)
um (8:17 - 8:23)
yeah maybe in the back but uh (8:19 - 8:23)
otherwise every other like purchase was (8:23 - 8:28)
digital it was like amazon music apple (8:25 - 8:29)
music (8:28 - 8:31)
spotify etc so i think if you want a (8:29 - 8:33)
physical album (8:31 - 8:35)
for to put next to your (8:33 - 8:36)
ancient mew (8:35 - 8:39)
[Laughter] (8:36 - 8:41)
i mean here's the thing (8:39 - 8:43)
i (8:41 - 8:43)
i like buying physical (8:43 - 8:48)
commemorative items (8:45 - 8:51)
me too but at this point the only thing (8:48 - 8:53)
that's really pokemon about it is the (8:51 - 8:54)
cover (8:53 - 8:56)
and i'll just download the jpeg and (8:54 - 8:58)
print it out like there you go there's (8:56 - 9:01)
nothing about this album that screams (8:58 - 9:03)
pokemon to me like there's a couple of (9:01 - 9:06)
songs that vaguely reference the series (9:03 - 9:08)
i'll throw it on spotify and listen to (9:06 - 9:10)
it once and then promptly forget (9:08 - 9:13)
this is no to be a master let's be real (9:10 - 9:15)
yeah you know if there's a bop on there (9:13 - 9:17)
that you just haven't realized yet (9:15 - 9:19)
there could be a yeah there could be (9:17 - 9:22)
looking at the list of people on this (9:19 - 9:24)
album i guarantee you i will not find a (9:22 - 9:26)
bop (9:24 - 9:28)
for me what about the secret jukebox the (9:26 - 9:30)
joke the jukebox (9:28 - 9:33)
you know the band i'm talking about (9:30 - 9:36)
jukebox the ghost ghost (9:33 - 9:38)
if they have a hidden track i will buy (9:36 - 9:42)
that track on its own somewhere (9:38 - 9:42)
i'm i mean i'm not one to sit here i'm (9:42 - 9:44)
not a (9:43 - 9:47)
i used to be a big uh (9:44 - 9:50)
music fan when i was younger i kind of (9:47 - 9:52)
don't like when i when i'm listening to (9:50 - 9:53)
things in the shower or the car more (9:52 - 9:55)
than long it's just podcast at this (9:53 - 9:57)
point it's or audio books it's not (9:55 - 9:58)
specifically music (9:57 - 10:01)
i do think it is really cool for a huge (9:58 - 10:03)
company to get a bunch of people (10:01 - 10:04)
together to make an album i think that's (10:03 - 10:07)
sweet i love that concept i'm into it (10:04 - 10:10)
and i'm sure if you love vin staples or (10:07 - 10:12)
you love mabel or you love somebody else (10:10 - 10:14)
on this track this list (10:12 - 10:17)
you're probably somewhat excited (10:14 - 10:19)
and if you're (10:17 - 10:21)
it's probably a decent way to discover a (10:19 - 10:22)
new artist to be like i don't know who (10:21 - 10:24)
luanne is and i really liked game girl (10:22 - 10:26)
as a song (10:24 - 10:27)
i mean i'm going to listen to it once (10:26 - 10:29)
but (10:27 - 10:31)
i'm i'm feel like i'm in that phase (10:29 - 10:34)
that i'm not looking for new artists (10:31 - 10:35)
i mean (10:34 - 10:38)
my wife puts on music that's cool if i'm (10:35 - 10:40)
in a friend's car and they put on music (10:38 - 10:42)
cool but like i'm in this you know your (10:40 - 10:45)
wife only listens to three bands (10:42 - 10:46)
she she's (10:45 - 10:49)
there's a lot bts fall out boy panic at (10:46 - 10:51)
the disco okay (10:49 - 10:55)
first off it's bts fall out boy txt i (10:51 - 10:57)
don't think panic at the disco is even (10:55 - 10:59)
in top top 20. i don't know what tvxt is (10:57 - 11:02)
i don't know that yeah i mean (10:59 - 11:04)
i am always for new (11:02 - 11:07)
artists like and it (11:04 - 11:07)
what i (11:07 - 11:11)
still sort of take (11:09 - 11:14)
a little bit of side eye towards this is (11:11 - 11:17)
you can discover these new artists and (11:14 - 11:19)
there's music and still have it's (11:17 - 11:21)
much more strongly tied to pokemon (11:19 - 11:24)
for a pokemon album (11:21 - 11:25)
that is the main issue right it does (11:24 - 11:27)
just feel like (11:25 - 11:30)
a bunch of people who are willing to (11:27 - 11:33)
to get on the pokemon (11:30 - 11:33)
money train (11:34 - 11:37)
with minimal effort (11:35 - 11:40)
i i would uh hope slash assume that the (11:37 - 11:42)
people here are the people who like (11:40 - 11:45)
we're excited to be on it (11:42 - 11:48)
like i know some people are like oh well (11:45 - 11:50)
katy perry maybe doesn't like pokemon (11:48 - 11:52)
but i don't maybe i don't know (11:50 - 11:53)
maybe she does (11:52 - 11:55)
it's hard to tell how genuine somebody (11:53 - 11:58)
is or maybe they did ask people (11:55 - 12:00)
maybe they did ask like i don't know (11:58 - 12:02)
jay-z or bts or (12:00 - 12:04)
shakira (12:02 - 12:05)
hey do you want to be on this and (12:04 - 12:08)
they're like nah pokemon's wack (12:05 - 12:11)
no thanks (12:08 - 12:11)
because jay-z (12:12 - 12:17)
is going to lower himself (12:14 - 12:19)
to make a pokemon track yeah (12:17 - 12:22)
i mean it's just (12:19 - 12:25)
however they got involved it i just (12:22 - 12:28)
it it it bothers me a little bit (12:25 - 12:31)
that's all (12:28 - 12:31)
yeah uh i mean i'll get the target (12:31 - 12:35)
version i guess and then listen to it on (12:33 - 12:37)
spotify for i'll come to your house and (12:35 - 12:39)
steal it if they really we should have (12:37 - 12:40)
to listen let's have a listening party (12:39 - 12:43)
okay oh god get d monetized on youtube (12:40 - 12:44)
instantly (12:43 - 12:46)
i mean we'll just have it we'll just (12:44 - 12:49)
have it muted and tell everybody go to (12:46 - 12:51)
spotify play it at your home and then (12:49 - 12:54)
you can see our reactions live (12:51 - 12:57)

everybody here everybody hit play (12:57 - 13:02)
and then you'll know which one we're on (12:59 - 13:03)

twitch person that i know that has (13:03 - 13:07)

their (13:07 - 13:09)
spotify (13:10 - 13:14)
song list (13:11 - 13:14)

go you're listening to the exact same (13:17 - 13:21)
thing that i know what i'm talking about (13:18 - 13:22)

drastic music (13:37 - 13:40)

without a costume after fashion week is (21:28 - 21:33)
concluded you won't see blitzel very (21:30 - 21:35)
often in the wild well (21:33 - 21:36)
well i mean thanks for letting us know (21:35 - 21:37)
at least (21:36 - 21:40)
get wrecked catch it now communication (21:37 - 21:43)
slightly better i guess on that one (21:40 - 21:45)
okay this is how the form thing works (21:43 - 21:46)
when you see it for free you catch it it (21:45 - 21:48)
will always be the natural trim (21:46 - 21:50)
you can then select (21:48 - 21:51)
the (21:50 - 21:54)
form change button available in the menu (21:51 - 21:56)
it's under the power up button where the (21:54 - 21:57)
evolve button would be (21:56 - 22:01)
and for 25 candy and 10 000 stardust you (21:57 - 22:03)
can change it to (22:01 - 22:07)
a form based on your region (22:03 - 22:08)
so you could catch a fur fruit in (22:07 - 22:12)
america travel to egypt and then change (22:08 - 22:14)
it to pharaoh form (22:12 - 22:16)
and then when you came back to america (22:14 - 22:18)
it would still be feral form i don't (22:16 - 22:19)
think what we know and i don't think (22:18 - 22:21)
they say (22:19 - 22:25)
is if you trade it will it stay (22:21 - 22:27)
because in the main series games i (22:25 - 22:29)
believe once you put fur fur in your box (22:27 - 22:31)
the trim goes away (22:29 - 22:33)
correct (22:31 - 22:35)
it does not stay but it was so easy to (22:33 - 22:37)
change the it was easy to change but (22:35 - 22:39)
it's not easy to change the pokemon go i (22:37 - 22:41)
can't fly to france to get the ren not (22:39 - 22:46)
with that also don't have klefki um (22:41 - 22:48)
what this is fine (22:46 - 22:49)
i don't know if somebody's (22:48 - 22:52)
there might be somebody i'm sure there's (22:49 - 22:53)
somebody complaining that these form (22:52 - 22:54)
changes like (22:53 - 22:56)
who's who cares it's not like for fruit (22:54 - 23:00)
gets better if it has the star skin or (22:56 - 23:02)
the skin beg to differ (23:00 - 23:04)
appearance is everything (23:02 - 23:06)
i do (23:04 - 23:06)
like (23:06 - 23:10)
the i do like regionals (23:06 - 23:10)
i get there an inconvenience for people (23:10 - 23:14)
that are like wanting to complete the (23:12 - 23:16)
entire collection (23:14 - 23:19)
i do like the concept of (23:16 - 23:20)
hey my friend (23:19 - 23:22)
like like in my head and i i would (23:20 - 23:24)
assume maybe niantic probably thought (23:22 - 23:27)
this when they thought of it (23:24 - 23:29)
but it it goes back to the core system (23:27 - 23:30)
of red and blue right (23:29 - 23:32)
i can't get manky you can't get (23:30 - 23:35)
sandshrew yes you finally meet somebody (23:32 - 23:37)
they trade you so (23:35 - 23:40)
before they did all these canto events (23:37 - 23:42)
where they moved kangaskhan into braids (23:40 - 23:43)
which they've done what three times now (23:42 - 23:46)
and they put in eggs twice now (23:43 - 23:49)
like seeing my friend mark for the first (23:46 - 23:51)
time (23:49 - 23:52)
and then him trading kangaskhan to me at (23:51 - 23:54)
my wedding (23:52 - 23:57)
was like a cool moment that was the best (23:54 - 23:59)
memory from your entire wedding (23:57 - 24:01)
yeah getting the king it was actually a (23:59 - 24:02)
chat (24:01 - 24:04)
uh because he did kangaskhan i think the (24:02 - 24:06)
first day and then chat the second day (24:04 - 24:07)
um (24:06 - 24:09)
and i think those memories are cool and (24:07 - 24:11)
i think that's kind of you know pokemon (24:09 - 24:13)
go or main series game or just the (24:11 - 24:15)
series as a whole like (24:13 - 24:16)
that is (24:15 - 24:18)
something that they aim to do like (24:16 - 24:22)
create those specific types of memories (24:18 - 24:24)
so i like regionals in that (24:22 - 24:26)
aspect (24:24 - 24:26)
i think regionals that probably appeal (24:27 - 24:31)
to everyone a little bit more something (24:29 - 24:33)
like shellos where it's like i don't (24:31 - 24:34)
have the pink one or i don't have the (24:33 - 24:36)
blue one but it doesn't matter they're (24:34 - 24:37)
exactly the same it's like yeah you're (24:36 - 24:39)
missing one of them but it's not like (24:37 - 24:42)
you're like tr tropius is a problem (24:39 - 24:46)
because tropius is exclusive to africa (24:42 - 24:49)
tropius is good in gbl (24:46 - 24:51)
so like that (24:49 - 24:55)
is a problem pokemon (24:51 - 24:55)
whereas like (24:55 - 24:57)
furfur is going to be available (24:56 - 24:58)
everywhere (24:57 - 25:00)
and your form is based on your location (24:58 - 25:01)
so it'd be cool if like you know the (25:00 - 25:03)
three of us go to japan and we're like (25:01 - 25:04)
ah we we're saving up for fruit to (25:03 - 25:06)
change and then we come back like that's (25:04 - 25:08)
cool moment but also like (25:06 - 25:10)
the japanese fur fruit isn't stronger (25:08 - 25:11)
than the (25:10 - 25:14)
daddy for fruit (25:11 - 25:16)
please don't (25:14 - 25:19)
please don't encourage the children (25:16 - 25:22)
uh so i think that for i i would also uh (25:19 - 25:24)
guess is this is how you're gonna change (25:22 - 25:26)
hoopa or meloetta those are two pokemon (25:24 - 25:27)
with forms (25:26 - 25:28)
you probably have to gonna spend (25:27 - 25:30)
stardust (25:28 - 25:31)
slash i mean (25:30 - 25:34)
hoopa is evolved is based on an actual (25:31 - 25:36)
item like you have to have that bottle (25:34 - 25:38)
to make it (25:36 - 25:40)
uh yeah but that hasn't worked with (25:38 - 25:43)
other pokemon and pokemon go so (25:40 - 25:46)
they're just yeah anything roll the dice (25:43 - 25:48)
are they gonna retro do this for cast (25:46 - 25:49)
form (25:48 - 25:52)
like i don't know (25:49 - 25:52)
yes (25:53 - 25:55)
like if you want your cast form to be (25:54 - 25:57)
rainy you gotta wait for it to be rainy (25:55 - 25:59)
then hit the button you can change it (25:57 - 26:01)
well they i mean (25:59 - 26:04)
some stuff and go like um (26:01 - 26:06)
the machamp and the alakazam and all (26:04 - 26:07)
that's like when you trade they're (26:06 - 26:09)
they're free yeah they do trade (26:07 - 26:11)
they added they added trade evolutions (26:09 - 26:12)
yeah they could add it i mean i could (26:11 - 26:14)
see them saying hey if you have a (26:12 - 26:15)
regular cast form (26:14 - 26:17)
you can (26:15 - 26:18)
spend (26:17 - 26:20)
way too much stardust (26:18 - 26:21)
like ten thousand (26:20 - 26:23)
ten thousands a lot (26:21 - 26:27)
to make make a water cast form (26:23 - 26:28)
maybe they'll drop it to one that you (26:27 - 26:30)
can get naturally like it'll be a (26:28 - 26:31)
thousand (26:30 - 26:33)
and like one candy (26:31 - 26:35)
i feel like stardust just in general i (26:33 - 26:37)
get the game is grindy (26:35 - 26:41)
but man what a bad currency (26:37 - 26:41)
like like i have four million stardust (26:41 - 26:45)
right now (26:44 - 26:48)
okay all you got maybe (26:45 - 26:49)
i don't have that much (26:48 - 26:51)
i could maybe power up like what six (26:49 - 26:55)
pokemon and then i'm out (26:51 - 26:58)
i guess kind of i don't know (26:55 - 26:58)
it's time for stardust check (26:59 - 27:02)
i don't know if i played pogo today (27:05 - 27:09)

stardust will that's that is not true i (27:49 - 27:54)
have traded pokemon force you to trade (27:51 - 27:56)
and i have powered up pokemon for (27:54 - 27:58)
research tasks oh hey i have enough (27:56 - 28:01)
omega candy to evolve obama snow (27:58 - 28:04)
oh yeah this weekend grass is super (28:01 - 28:06)
effective against water you would (28:04 - 28:07)
probably want to make a vault of water (28:06 - 28:10)
pokemon though to get that bonus (28:07 - 28:10)
oh i might do gyarados this weekend (28:10 - 28:13)
yeah (28:12 - 28:15)
you're giving out six strats the day (28:13 - 28:17)
after yeah that's true yeah you're right (28:15 - 28:19)
yeah it was a wonderful oshawa it was a (28:17 - 28:22)
wonderful oshawa day we had very much (28:19 - 28:24)
fun (28:22 - 28:24)
um (28:25 - 28:27)
we did the track lists we did pogo (28:28 - 28:33)
we have three more news articles this (28:31 - 28:34)
one we'll do and then we'll take a break (28:33 - 28:37)
and then we'll do the other two but (28:34 - 28:39)
i think we're getting to a point where (28:37 - 28:43)
it's maybe safe to buy the cookies (28:39 - 28:45)
this is off eater.com (28:43 - 28:47)
after weeks of picketing the nabisco (28:45 - 28:51)
workers strike might come to an end (28:47 - 28:52)
i don't think we have to spend a lot of (28:51 - 28:53)
time on this but they have (28:52 - 28:56)
they have reached a tentative agreement (28:53 - 28:58)
with the mandela's mondelez (28:56 - 29:01)
international regarding its new contract (28:58 - 29:03)
if you guys don't know this nabisco they (29:01 - 29:05)
make oreos chips ahoys ritz (29:03 - 29:07)
um (29:05 - 29:07)
not the best company in the world (29:08 - 29:11)
not not close to maybe a decent company (29:11 - 29:16)
look they're not nestle all right at (29:14 - 29:18)
least they're not nestled (29:16 - 29:20)
i mean this is not a lot of things but (29:18 - 29:22)
yes large corporations in general ain't (29:20 - 29:23)
great (29:22 - 29:25)
so (29:23 - 29:27)
you might have saw on social media (29:25 - 29:29)
don't buy anything nabisco including (29:27 - 29:31)
pokemon oreos because this strike is (29:29 - 29:32)
happening (29:31 - 29:35)
uh it seems that they're (29:32 - 29:38)
coming to an agreement so (29:35 - 29:39)
i don't know on monday if the agreement (29:38 - 29:42)
will be settled uh this they've reached (29:39 - 29:43)
this (29:42 - 29:46)
on september 16th at about 10 a.m (29:43 - 29:47)
um and it's now 8 p.m and that we (29:46 - 29:49)
haven't really heard anything from it (29:47 - 29:50)
but (29:49 - 29:52)
i mean this this takes (29:50 - 29:55)
time yeah like they've they've the the (29:52 - 29:58)
representatives have come to (29:55 - 30:00)
a contract that both sides think are (29:58 - 30:02)
good and then they have to take it to (30:00 - 30:03)
their workers and say (30:02 - 30:06)
will you accept this and the workers can (30:03 - 30:07)
still say (30:06 - 30:10)
no and then they go back to the drawing (30:07 - 30:10)
go back (30:10 - 30:12)
but (30:10 - 30:14)
generally if the union representatives (30:12 - 30:16)
come up with a contract that they think (30:14 - 30:18)
is agreeable (30:16 - 30:22)
generally the masses are fine with it (30:18 - 30:24)
but it does take time because they do (30:22 - 30:26)
have to take it back to everybody and (30:24 - 30:27)
say okay (30:26 - 30:29)
yes no (30:27 - 30:32)
except contract deny contract yeah (30:29 - 30:34)
uh (30:32 - 30:36)
i got sent pokemon cookies i got sent a (30:34 - 30:38)
pack i haven't opened i haven't even (30:36 - 30:41)
remembered the box so (30:38 - 30:41)
the other (30:42 - 30:44)
people were trying to sell these cookies (30:43 - 30:46)
on ebay (30:44 - 30:49)
i don't want to buy cookies off of ebay (30:46 - 30:51)
i don't know what you did to my cookies (30:49 - 30:54)
ebay person ebay weirdo i don't know (30:51 - 30:57)
what you do with your life i ain't (30:54 - 31:00)
buying your cookie agreed 100 (30:57 - 31:01)
sketch (31:00 - 31:04)
sketchy ebay cookies are a no-go this (31:01 - 31:06)
happened with the lady gaga cookies too (31:04 - 31:08)
they also went up on ebay (31:06 - 31:11)
and i still wouldn't buy them (31:08 - 31:11)
i don't think anyone should be buying (31:11 - 31:15)
cookies on ebay (31:13 - 31:17)
yes you do you're an ebay person you (31:15 - 31:19)
were right now thinking should i put (31:17 - 31:21)
these pokemon oreo cookies (31:19 - 31:23)
i have i can't even i don't even think (31:21 - 31:25)
i've ever sold the pokemon item on ebay (31:23 - 31:28)
i have sold like (31:25 - 31:31)
iphones on ebay this sounds like (31:28 - 31:35)
i've never sold a tcg card on ebay no (31:31 - 31:35)
i like it's just easier to (31:36 - 31:40)
sell tcg cards to like just a card shop (31:38 - 31:42)
you get like probably less but i want to (31:40 - 31:45)
send one package of like 7 000 cards and (31:42 - 31:48)
i wanted to be over with it (31:45 - 31:48)
i will take the less money for the (31:48 - 31:52)
convenience of not individually packing (31:50 - 31:54)
and shipping cards that's not a business (31:52 - 31:55)
i want to be in (31:54 - 31:58)
uh not with that attitude (31:55 - 32:00)
i ain't got time for that ebay is a very (31:58 - 32:03)
time consuming uh (32:00 - 32:05)
not hobbies of some people's jobs (32:03 - 32:08)
it's a job it's a time-consuming job (32:05 - 32:09)
that pays (32:08 - 32:12)
a variable amount (32:09 - 32:13)
don't buy oreo cookies off ebay don't (32:12 - 32:16)
buy the food off ebay (32:13 - 32:18)
i've seen people buy ancient cereal and (32:16 - 32:21)
then eat said ancient syrup from the 80s (32:18 - 32:25)
and stop watching those youtube channels (32:21 - 32:27)
encouraging (32:25 - 32:28)
them don't know (32:27 - 32:30)
how did you get to the point where (32:28 - 32:32)
you're you're watching people eat old (32:30 - 32:34)
food okay (32:32 - 32:35)
my (32:34 - 32:37)
youtube algorithm has been infected by (32:35 - 32:38)

because the other day (32:38 - 32:43)
a bunch of extreme mountain biking (32:40 - 32:45)

cow hoof trimming videos (33:17 - 33:21)

husband and i looked at him and he said (33:21 - 33:25)

love we're getting so close to kramer (37:18 - 37:24)
and pokemon go i can taste it (37:20 - 37:25)
i mean i look at this list and i (37:24 - 37:28)
literally had to click off it and go (37:25 - 37:29)
back to it (37:28 - 37:33)
to verify that this wasn't a fake (37:29 - 37:36)
website that steve made i think scissors (37:33 - 37:38)
is actually the weird one here (37:36 - 37:41)
ah people like caesar yeah nobody likes (37:38 - 37:42)
crime rant (37:41 - 37:47)
well one person likes one person likes (37:42 - 37:47)
uh i thought they would have all of the (37:49 - 37:52)
starters (37:51 - 37:54)
do we do we now have the three-hour (37:52 - 37:55)
debate about how it's wrong for (37:54 - 37:57)
companies to have art contests and blah (37:55 - 38:00)
blah blah (37:57 - 38:02)
that was the hill i wanted to die (38:00 - 38:04)
we're all dying on that hill this is a (38:02 - 38:06)
bad idea i hate when they do this i hate (38:04 - 38:08)
when they do this too (38:06 - 38:09)
okay so (38:08 - 38:11)
give us your free hard work and you (38:09 - 38:14)
might get five thousand dollars (38:11 - 38:16)
yeah (38:14 - 38:17)
fyi in the hidden print we own your (38:16 - 38:20)
artwork once you send it into us (38:17 - 38:23)
i don't know (38:20 - 38:23)
how a company (38:23 - 38:29)
does this correctly (38:26 - 38:30)
no i do know how (38:29 - 38:33)
they found it they found an artist in (38:30 - 38:34)
the uk (38:33 - 38:36)
and they paid her (38:34 - 38:38)
to make a bedof print (38:36 - 38:41)
and there was no competition yeah (38:38 - 38:43)
like (38:41 - 38:44)
i totally (38:43 - 38:47)
understand the perspective of we have a (38:44 - 38:49)
bunch of people that love (38:47 - 38:51)
pokemon and they make art for it (38:49 - 38:53)
non-stop and they do that because that's (38:51 - 38:54)
a passion or a hobby or (38:53 - 38:56)
their career is art or (38:54 - 38:59)
they they're just get i i get that i get (38:56 - 39:00)
that people are gonna make pokemon art (38:59 - 39:03)
regardless (39:00 - 39:03)
but i just hate the like billion dollar (39:03 - 39:09)
company (39:07 - 39:12)
give us free art we will judge you at (39:09 - 39:16)
the end of it we own your art and (39:12 - 39:16)
99.9 percent of people that participate (39:16 - 39:21)
will probably be severely disappointed (39:19 - 39:25)
yep well life is disappointment so (39:21 - 39:26)
there are some artists that are that are (39:25 - 39:29)
probably like i don't care i i make a (39:26 - 39:32)
bulbasaur image every saturday night i'm (39:29 - 39:33)
just gonna spend this saturday night to (39:32 - 39:35)
send it into this (39:33 - 39:38)
yep but there there is at least a (39:35 - 39:39)
handful of people out there that (39:38 - 39:41)
legitimately think they're gonna (39:39 - 39:43)
win and they're going to be and that's (39:41 - 39:45)
that's on them i guess then they're (39:43 - 39:46)
going to be devastated when they don't (39:45 - 39:48)
win the thing that bothers me the most (39:46 - 39:50)
about this (39:48 - 39:52)
is this company (39:50 - 39:54)
the pokemon company these pokemon (39:52 - 39:55)
companies (39:54 - 39:58)
they can't even do good (39:55 - 40:01)
by contest (39:58 - 40:01)
let me remind you all (40:01 - 40:04)
from 2019 (40:04 - 40:09)
off kotaku (40:07 - 40:11)
pokemon t-shirt contest winner (40:09 - 40:12)
disqualified (40:11 - 40:14)
oh right (40:12 - 40:17)
about that pulled from upcoming game (40:14 - 40:19)
this like (40:17 - 40:20)
i think if they would have handled the (40:19 - 40:22)
situation better (40:20 - 40:25)
this announcement to me wouldn't feel so (40:22 - 40:28)
salty or like here's just another (40:25 - 40:30)
billion dollar company getting free art (40:28 - 40:32)
from people because they handled this so (40:30 - 40:35)
poorly so i'm gonna we're gonna go we (40:32 - 40:36)
talked about this on the podcast this is (40:35 - 40:38)
like two years ago now this is a long (40:36 - 40:40)
time ago and i completely forgot about (40:38 - 40:43)
it so a japanese clothing company unique (40:40 - 40:45)
leo or how do you ever say it uniqlo (40:43 - 40:49)
uniqlo announced that a chinese artist (40:45 - 40:50)
lee wen pai (40:49 - 40:54)
won the ut grand prix pre for (40:50 - 40:58)
contest for designing a pokemon t-shirt (40:54 - 40:59)
uh (40:58 - 41:01)
lee was going to win 10 000 (40:59 - 41:04)
and to have their design featured in (41:01 - 41:06)
pokemon sword and shield set to come out (41:04 - 41:08)
the switch later this year (41:06 - 41:11)
they were disqualified because they (41:08 - 41:13)
didn't adhere to the rules now that's (41:11 - 41:15)
fair that's like (41:13 - 41:16)
them (41:15 - 41:17)
not following the rules getting (41:16 - 41:19)
disqualified that that's not the problem (41:17 - 41:21)
i have with this (41:19 - 41:22)
um (41:21 - 41:25)
so the japanese global apparel retailer (41:22 - 41:26)
announced that they disqualified the (41:25 - 41:28)
grand prize winner another finalist (41:26 - 41:31)
uh in its pokemon themed (41:28 - 41:32)

no grand prize will be given to uh will (41:39 - 41:46)
be awarded or given to another entrant (41:43 - 41:47)

ocean king it was very it's a good shirt (41:54 - 41:58)
it's a very good shirt really good (41:56 - 42:00)
design (41:58 - 42:02)
so the reason it was disqualified they (42:00 - 42:04)
say possible reason here but we've (42:02 - 42:06)
obviously two years have passed we know (42:04 - 42:10)
why it's disqualified is because they (42:06 - 42:12)
initially (42:10 - 42:12)
didn't make the design for this so one (42:13 - 42:17)
of the rules was your design could not (42:14 - 42:19)
exist anywhere it had to be solely for (42:17 - 42:21)
this this is part of the pokemon now (42:19 - 42:24)
owns your artwork thing well it had it (42:21 - 42:26)
couldn't have been used for commercial (42:24 - 42:28)
purposes elsewhere (42:26 - 42:30)
like you could have posted it but no you (42:28 - 42:32)
were not allowed to post it that was one (42:30 - 42:33)
of the rules oh (42:32 - 42:34)
okay (42:33 - 42:36)
but they (42:34 - 42:38)
yeah they were like you're not allowed (42:36 - 42:41)
to show off the design it was i (42:38 - 42:45)
but they like made a like an iphone case (42:41 - 42:48)
and they sold like two of them with it (42:45 - 42:52)
which probably wouldn't have mattered (42:48 - 42:53)
or gotten caught (42:52 - 42:56)
but another company (42:53 - 42:58)
stole that design and manufactured (42:56 - 43:02)
a bunch of those cases and that's why it (42:58 - 43:04)
got caught (43:02 - 43:05)
so (43:04 - 43:09)
the the problem i have with this (43:05 - 43:12)
and why i i don't like this tcg thing (43:09 - 43:14)
is because of how they handled it they (43:12 - 43:16)
pulled the prize and they pulled the (43:14 - 43:18)
shirt from it was supposed to be a shirt (43:16 - 43:20)
you could buy irl (43:18 - 43:25)
and a shirt you could buy in the game (43:20 - 43:25)
why did they not just give this to the (43:27 - 43:30)
second prize winner why did they not (43:28 - 43:33)
draw a new third like okay second prize (43:30 - 43:35)
winner you are now here's your ten (43:33 - 43:36)
thousand dollars (43:35 - 43:39)
your shirt is in the game your shirt (43:36 - 43:41)
will be on store shelves (43:39 - 43:43)
like i how did the second and third (43:41 - 43:45)
players prize winners feel (43:43 - 43:47)
that not only did they come in second (43:45 - 43:48)
and third (43:47 - 43:49)
they got nothing (43:48 - 43:52)
yeah they got nothing and see it's a (43:49 - 43:53)
very cultural thing because if you're (43:52 - 43:57)
not first you're not first (43:53 - 43:57)
and us as players we didn't even get a (43:57 - 44:02)
shirt in the game no at all (44:00 - 44:05)
we couldn't like why what happened (44:02 - 44:07)
around shirtless the whole time so cold (44:05 - 44:09)
in those snowy sections i think i think (44:07 - 44:11)
they handled it very poorly i don't know (44:09 - 44:14)
what you guys think but i i i agree i (44:11 - 44:16)
don't know why they wouldn't have gone (44:14 - 44:17)
to the second (44:16 - 44:21)
at least given the second person (44:17 - 44:21)
the prize money yeah (44:21 - 44:26)
like i can give the second person the (44:24 - 44:27)
shirt in the game (44:26 - 44:29)
maybe they had already coded the game or (44:27 - 44:31)
like we can't switch (44:29 - 44:32)
that that i think that's what we were (44:31 - 44:34)
speculating at that point yeah like we (44:32 - 44:36)
can't switch the shirt because it's (44:34 - 44:38)
already too late whatever and unique a (44:36 - 44:39)
little bit like we already ordered a (44:38 - 44:40)
bunch of these shirts and we can't stop (44:39 - 44:43)
it to hit whatever like i there are (44:40 - 44:44)
probably business reasons why they (44:43 - 44:47)
couldn't undo that shirt decision (44:44 - 44:49)
depending on when they caught it (44:47 - 44:51)
but (44:49 - 44:54)
give the prize money (44:51 - 44:57)
like pay the people (44:54 - 44:57)
i'm so scared this is gonna happen again (45:00 - 45:04)
with this tcg they're gonna pick a (45:02 - 45:06)
winner and they're gonna be like oh this (45:04 - 45:07)
existed on your deviantart for the last (45:06 - 45:09)
five years you're disqualified no tcg (45:07 - 45:11)
cards for everyone like (45:09 - 45:14)
yeah it's weird although on the (45:11 - 45:16)
illustrator sheet (45:14 - 45:16)
uh (45:16 - 45:18)
reference sheet you do get creme rent (45:16 - 45:21)
booties so (45:18 - 45:23)
it is worth it for that (45:21 - 45:25)
because they show poses because you're (45:23 - 45:26)
supposed to draw all the things in (45:25 - 45:28)
various forms so they give you multi (45:26 - 45:31)
poses and you get to see the booty of (45:28 - 45:35)
every they do a 3d model (45:31 - 45:38)
oh i see the theme in references yeah (45:35 - 45:39)
i put it in chat (45:38 - 45:41)
yes (45:39 - 45:41)
um i don't i don't i never like when (45:45 - 45:52)
companies do these i hate it (45:48 - 45:52)
all right (45:53 - 45:56)
when we thought that leon was the bait (45:56 - 46:01)
in pokemon masters well he was the bait (45:58 - 46:02)
he wasn't the bait he was the thing he (46:01 - 46:04)
was the contest winner and you all (46:02 - 46:05)
thought oh there's something better (46:04 - 46:08)
coming and there wasn't and they gave us (46:05 - 46:11)
they gave us lily and (46:08 - 46:13)
lunala (46:11 - 46:14)
in a very pretty dress (46:13 - 46:18)
they gave us steven stone and shiny (46:14 - 46:19)
rayquaza (46:18 - 46:23)
and they gave us it's mega mega rayquaza (46:19 - 46:24)
ribbon (46:23 - 46:25)
n (46:24 - 46:27)
and restaurant yes (46:25 - 46:31)
three very popular characters three (46:27 - 46:32)
debatable but i thought very good (46:31 - 46:34)
outfits (46:32 - 46:36)
um (46:34 - 46:39)
and those were actually the bait too (46:36 - 46:42)
the double bait (46:39 - 46:42)
now they have announced (46:42 - 46:51)
red and snorlax and blue and aerodactyl (46:45 - 46:51)
in pokemon masters ex (46:51 - 46:56)
red and snorlax already in the game as (46:54 - 46:58)
of now by the time this podcast goes up (46:56 - 46:59)
blue and aerodactyl should be in the (46:58 - 47:01)
game too (46:59 - 47:02)
um (47:01 - 47:04)
snorlax has the (47:02 - 47:07)
gigantomax ability so this is our second (47:04 - 47:09)
gigantimax right (47:07 - 47:11)
i mean (47:09 - 47:14)
and then blue has the mega aerodactyl to (47:11 - 47:17)
everyone saying mangoes are dead they (47:14 - 47:18)
they're not they've existed pokemon (47:17 - 47:20)
masters (47:18 - 47:23)
and pokemon go (47:20 - 47:26)
uh (47:23 - 47:26)
i didn't really think about this (47:26 - 47:31)
that they can just take characters that (47:29 - 47:33)
already exist re-release them again put (47:31 - 47:35)
the word classic next to it and people (47:33 - 47:39)
lose their minds (47:35 - 47:42)
oh and uh uh giovanni and mega mewtwo (47:39 - 47:42)
and (47:42 - 47:43)
the (47:42 - 47:45)
instead of the black suit he's wearing a (47:43 - 47:46)
white suit (47:45 - 47:49)
when he exes (47:46 - 47:52)
so we're not getting rainbow rocket (47:49 - 47:54)
no he's always so that was a that was a (47:52 - 47:55)
mistake on our part he's always had the (47:54 - 47:58)
rainbow rocket patch um (47:55 - 47:58)
greg what do you what are you thinking (47:59 - 48:04)
these aren't (48:01 - 48:04)
they don't it's they're nothing (48:05 - 48:08)
it's like (48:08 - 48:10)
they're cool (48:08 - 48:11)
no (48:10 - 48:14)
they're not i already have (48:11 - 48:17)
red i already have two blue (48:14 - 48:20)
now you can have a third blue or what (48:17 - 48:22)
with aerodactyl uh (48:20 - 48:24)
no there's already a better rock type (48:22 - 48:27)
there's like normal types are nothing (48:24 - 48:32)
and and i would be excited if (48:27 - 48:32)
gigantomax starlax changed on screen but (48:32 - 48:36)
we learned (48:34 - 48:39)
we don't he does uh gmax replenish or (48:36 - 48:40)
whatever (48:39 - 48:42)
yeah but (48:40 - 48:44)
i don't think the icon's gonna change (48:42 - 48:46)
because it didn't change for eternities (48:44 - 48:48)
so it's just gonna be the move you're (48:46 - 48:50)
going to see it briefly in an animation (48:48 - 48:51)
and then (48:50 - 48:53)
nothing (48:51 - 48:54)
like (48:53 - 48:56)
this is not everybody's like oh (48:54 - 48:58)
they're not even interesting outfits (48:56 - 49:01)
there's classic outfits (48:58 - 49:03)
not interesting outfits (49:01 - 49:07)
classic not interesting classic coke was (49:03 - 49:10)
only better because new coke was so bad (49:07 - 49:12)
the (49:10 - 49:14)
i will say though (49:12 - 49:16)
you know some people obviously the the (49:14 - 49:17)
appeal of the masters is like (49:16 - 49:20)
gravitating towards characters you like (49:17 - 49:22)
some people love blue some love red some (49:20 - 49:24)
love lily some love marnie obviously you (49:22 - 49:26)
know if you don't care about n you're (49:24 - 49:27)
probably not gonna well we learned that (49:26 - 49:29)
a lot of people don't care about ingo (49:27 - 49:31)
and emmett (49:29 - 49:34)
at least in america but some people did (49:31 - 49:36)
um (49:34 - 49:36)
there (49:38 - 49:40)
this is a good anniversary though they (49:38 - 49:42)
kind of knocked it out of the park with (49:40 - 49:45)
with everything they did in my opinion (49:42 - 49:47)
like all of the returning events these (49:45 - 49:49)
two characters the other three (49:47 - 49:53)
characters the leon to lead up (49:49 - 49:55)
like two years into this game and it (49:53 - 49:56)
they feel (49:55 - 50:00)
just as confident as ever (49:56 - 50:00)
and it kind of like (50:01 - 50:04)
to me (50:03 - 50:06)
we went into the two-year on this show (50:04 - 50:07)
and we were like what could they even do (50:06 - 50:10)
and they did a lot i mean they did a lot (50:07 - 50:13)
i mean bringing (50:10 - 50:13)
i would argue they didn't do anything (50:14 - 50:18)
surprising really uh the anniversary (50:16 - 50:21)
pairs were good that event (50:18 - 50:23)
was just a standard event (50:21 - 50:25)
bringing back all the other events is (50:23 - 50:27)
what pretty much every gadget game does (50:25 - 50:29)
it's like hey it's two years here's all (50:27 - 50:30)
the things you missed because you're (50:29 - 50:33)
gonna get new players coming in like it (50:30 - 50:35)
was (50:33 - 50:36)
it wasn't september 500 free polls as (50:35 - 50:38)
well it wasn't surprising to me that (50:36 - 50:40)
they did that (50:38 - 50:42)
like they didn't break the mold of what (50:40 - 50:44)
any other (50:42 - 50:46)
gadget game has done dragalia lost in a (50:44 - 50:48)
hundred free polls for their two year (50:46 - 50:51)
anniversary a bunch of them do it (50:48 - 50:53)
um that's to say there's (50:51 - 50:54)
they took all the good things that (50:53 - 50:57)
everybody does for anniversaries and did (50:54 - 50:59)
them which is great like it got a lot of (50:57 - 51:02)
people excited it was fun but (50:59 - 51:05)
i can't point to a thing that i'm like (51:02 - 51:07)
this was a brand new take i've never (51:05 - 51:08)
seen this done before in these types of (51:07 - 51:10)
games it (51:08 - 51:12)
they did they hit all the things they (51:10 - 51:14)
needed to hit (51:12 - 51:17)
it excited a bunch of new players they (51:14 - 51:19)
introduced a few good pairs (51:17 - 51:22)
sexy leon is here and that was the best (51:19 - 51:23)
thing but that was a (51:22 - 51:26)
up lead up to the anniversary (51:23 - 51:27)
um (51:26 - 51:30)
but like i expected (51:27 - 51:32)
for the two anniversary (51:30 - 51:34)
like more gigantic things to come in (51:32 - 51:36)
like this was your time to do it in that (51:34 - 51:38)
event and it's a little weird that (51:36 - 51:40)
they're doing it after (51:38 - 51:43)
because (51:40 - 51:44)
everybody was going through the three (51:43 - 51:46)
pairs like these are super powerful (51:44 - 51:47)
pairs (51:46 - 51:51)
and now it's after and it feels a little (51:47 - 51:55)
well if you want these spend money (51:51 - 51:57)
uh because we gave you all of this stuff (51:55 - 52:00)
for free mm-hmm yeah i mean they come on (51:57 - 52:01)
you know give it back they did you have (52:00 - 52:04)
a lot of gems though too (52:01 - 52:05)
i don't know how many gems they give (52:04 - 52:07)
compared to last year though i'm sure (52:05 - 52:09)
somebody probably caught that but yeah i (52:07 - 52:11)
mean i think it was more uh because the (52:09 - 52:13)
one year anniversary was not (52:11 - 52:15)
spectacular (52:13 - 52:16)
no i think this anniversary is better (52:15 - 52:17)
than the one year honestly yeah this (52:16 - 52:18)
central issue is better but they had (52:17 - 52:21)
they learned a lot um that said i think (52:18 - 52:23)
there is still (52:21 - 52:24)
i think there's still way too many (52:23 - 52:26)
currencies in this game yeah still way (52:24 - 52:28)
too many currencies like the promise of (52:26 - 52:29)
the units (52:28 - 52:32)
didn't necessarily pan out in game (52:29 - 52:34)
uh (52:32 - 52:36)
so i think they're (52:34 - 52:38)
for hardcore people (52:36 - 52:40)
there are a number of stumbles (52:38 - 52:43)
uh but but for new people for what they (52:40 - 52:45)
want for to get new people in and get (52:43 - 52:47)
new people (52:45 - 52:49)
up to speed to play the game it was very (52:47 - 52:51)
successful (52:49 - 52:54)
but it also was not groundbreaking yeah (52:51 - 52:56)
i can't i can't speak as a hardcore (52:54 - 52:58)
player i mean i play (52:56 - 53:00)
10 to 15 minutes every day and i feel (52:58 - 53:02)
like there's more than enough for me to (53:00 - 53:03)
do (53:02 - 53:05)
um when i log in (53:03 - 53:06)
and it's a little bit overwhelming (53:05 - 53:08)
honestly (53:06 - 53:10)
uh with like oh we have these new egg (53:08 - 53:12)
events with shiny dratini and we have (53:10 - 53:13)
all these villains and it's like i (53:12 - 53:14)
missed three of the villains but i'm (53:13 - 53:16)
gonna focus on one and then (53:14 - 53:18)
we have this (53:16 - 53:21)
we have uh what that we had the like uh (53:18 - 53:23)
the squirtle bulbasaur pikachu or (53:21 - 53:25)
squirtle bulbs for charmander thing and (53:23 - 53:27)
then the other anniversary things (53:25 - 53:30)
there's a lot there's a lot to do and (53:27 - 53:31)
um (53:30 - 53:33)
and it wasn't clear what was gonna cost (53:31 - 53:35)
eminem what didn't (53:33 - 53:38)
so that was always like (53:35 - 53:40)
what i mean i didn't have the problem (53:38 - 53:42)
because i don't spend all my stamina so (53:40 - 53:44)
i i would do all the one-offs to make (53:42 - 53:45)
sure that i hit them and then whatever (53:44 - 53:48)
was left i just burned it on like misty (53:45 - 53:49)
or (53:48 - 53:51)
yeah whatever the three event content (53:49 - 53:53)
yeah misty was a new free character hop (53:51 - 53:55)
was a new free character yeah i mean so (53:53 - 53:57)
they (53:55 - 53:59)
i think the biggest (53:57 - 54:02)
thing that i don't (53:59 - 54:02)
i'm kind of confused as to what masters (54:02 - 54:07)
wants to be now (54:05 - 54:09)
because they feel like they are shifting (54:07 - 54:12)
towards a (54:09 - 54:12)
character collection game (54:12 - 54:19)
and less towards uh (54:16 - 54:22)
any other type of game like they keep (54:19 - 54:24)
coming out with pairs they are doubling (54:22 - 54:26)
up on pairs pairs that you can't use (54:24 - 54:28)
with each other like i can't (54:26 - 54:31)
pick snorlax red and (54:28 - 54:33)
charizard charizard red like i can't do (54:31 - 54:34)
that (54:33 - 54:37)
so (54:34 - 54:37)
that that sort of weird limitation those (54:38 - 54:43)
weird things are happening where it it (54:41 - 54:46)
is shifting away from like a strategy (54:43 - 54:48)
figure out these puzzles do this thing (54:46 - 54:50)
too (54:48 - 54:52)
spend money to collect the characters (54:50 - 54:54)
that you like because you aren't going (54:52 - 54:56)
to be able to use all of them anyways (54:54 - 54:59)
and so it is now really feeling like a (54:56 - 55:01)
much more of a pure collection game and (54:59 - 55:04)
especially as they keep pushing (55:01 - 55:07)
these egg events because eggs are bad (55:04 - 55:09)
like there's just (55:07 - 55:10)
nothing (55:09 - 55:12)
definitely right you're like bad to use (55:10 - 55:14)
they're bad to use they're funny though (55:12 - 55:16)
they are just a collection event (55:14 - 55:19)
and like the game is really (55:16 - 55:22)
becoming just a collection game (55:19 - 55:24)
and i'm not so sure that i'm interested (55:22 - 55:28)
in that because just collecting means (55:24 - 55:30)
just give us money (55:28 - 55:32)
because yeah i can see that as somebody (55:30 - 55:34)
who like i do like to just collect one (55:32 - 55:36)
for every unit um (55:34 - 55:39)
and i i i very rarely do those hardcore (55:36 - 55:40)
events those like really hard ones but (55:39 - 55:43)
i've done a couple and and (55:40 - 55:45)
when when you do it it feels great like (55:43 - 55:49)
oh gosh i finally got this cool um (55:45 - 55:52)
yeah i don't i don't know what (55:49 - 55:54)
i i am coming from a place where i've (55:52 - 55:55)
never played another gotcha game so i (55:54 - 55:58)
don't know what the end stuff looks like (55:55 - 56:00)
there is no end to gotcha games there's (55:58 - 56:03)
no way no no no no no no i mean like you (56:00 - 56:04)
know you you have all these powerful (56:03 - 56:06)
pairs and you're doing these things but (56:04 - 56:09)
what else are you doing um yeah but i (56:06 - 56:11)
would (56:09 - 56:13)
wager to guess that's a small part of (56:11 - 56:16)
their market is doing that hard stuff (56:13 - 56:19)
yeah i mean i don't think (56:16 - 56:19)
i think it's where they appea i think (56:21 - 56:25)
that's where they get their whales right (56:23 - 56:28)
like right they the people who want to (56:25 - 56:29)
do the hard car content are the people (56:28 - 56:33)
that pay a lot of money into that game (56:29 - 56:33)
and i think that (56:33 - 56:37)
i think with the changes that they're (56:36 - 56:40)
making to masters i think (56:37 - 56:44)
that section is going to start shrinking (56:40 - 56:46)
because they haven't really come up with (56:44 - 56:48)
new really hard things to do (56:46 - 56:51)
in a bit like this event had one but the (56:48 - 56:53)
other ones really didn't (56:51 - 56:55)
yeah um (56:53 - 56:56)
champions (56:55 - 56:58)
castle has pretty much remained the same (56:56 - 57:00)
i think this is the first time they may (56:58 - 57:00)
have (57:00 - 57:03)
rotated the pokemon and i haven't looked (57:00 - 57:05)
well they finally updated the login (57:03 - 57:07)
bonus after two years and it's more (57:05 - 57:09)
appropriate yeah (57:07 - 57:12)
um battle via stays the same (57:09 - 57:14)
uh they just (57:12 - 57:16)
cycle through battling the same (57:14 - 57:17)
legendaries (57:16 - 57:21)
which is like if you know the trick (57:17 - 57:21)
to get it it's just a free (57:21 - 57:25)
like if you already had units to defeat (57:24 - 57:28)
the hard part it's not like (57:25 - 57:29)
when they bring it back that has (57:28 - 57:31)
radically altered it's the same (57:29 - 57:35)
is the same fight yeah so it's like (57:31 - 57:36)
i don't know (57:35 - 57:38)
i don't know what their vision is going (57:36 - 57:40)
forward other than it's now just a (57:38 - 57:44)
collection game and that (57:40 - 57:44)
that is not an exciting thing for me (57:44 - 57:48)
because (57:47 - 57:49)
at some point especially now we have (57:48 - 57:52)
like five banners going on (57:49 - 57:54)
where it's like (57:52 - 57:55)
i don't want to pull on any of these (57:54 - 57:57)
because i feel like (57:55 - 58:00)
choosing one means i have no chance of (57:57 - 58:02)
getting the others (58:00 - 58:04)
and i have to just come to terms with (58:02 - 58:06)
not collecting them and if i if i'm not (58:04 - 58:09)
collecting units what am i doing in this (58:06 - 58:11)
game (58:09 - 58:11)
having fun pokemon battles (58:12 - 58:17)
oh no you said it to auto battle so i (58:16 - 58:20)
guess not i mean i i don't auto battle (58:17 - 58:21)
all the way up to the top but once i (58:20 - 58:24)
beat the hardest thing i'm not going to (58:21 - 58:26)
do that fight 50 times yeah i mean (58:24 - 58:28)
without auto battle on like that's not (58:26 - 58:32)
grinding that way is not fun (58:28 - 58:34)
there's a challenge of so you only get (58:32 - 58:36)
auto battle on if you can defeat it (58:34 - 58:37)
without losing a unit (58:36 - 58:38)
yeah (58:37 - 58:42)
so that's like the that's like the trick (58:38 - 58:45)
and doing that to get better is (58:42 - 58:47)
well one depending on your units but (58:45 - 58:48)
also (58:47 - 58:51)
when you do do it it feels good (58:48 - 58:52)
but it's not going to feel as good the (58:51 - 58:53)
second time that's what you use let's (58:52 - 58:54)
skip the game yeah that's why you use (58:53 - 58:56)
the skip tickets (58:54 - 58:58)
and it's like again they've made a lot (58:56 - 59:00)
of quality of life improvements i just (58:58 - 59:03)
don't see (59:00 - 59:06)
anything like super exciting gameplay (59:03 - 59:08)
wise on the horizon and i was really (59:06 - 59:09)
hoping that (59:08 - 59:12)
dynamaxx would be a super exciting (59:09 - 59:15)
addition and it's just another sync move (59:12 - 59:18)
and that's just been sort of a letdown (59:15 - 59:20)
of how they incorporated that because (59:18 - 59:22)
they just feel like z moves (59:20 - 59:25)
instead of gigantic z moves and megas (59:22 - 59:28)
all already felt the same prior yeah at (59:25 - 59:31)
least megas change (59:28 - 59:33)
they change their actual four move set a (59:31 - 59:34)
lot of the time (59:33 - 59:37)
so like when you mega evolved i don't (59:34 - 59:39)
remember which one like (59:37 - 59:41)
male girls was a good one a bunch of (59:39 - 59:44)
them changed the moves change yeah but (59:41 - 59:44)
with (59:44 - 59:47)
dynamaxx nothing changes it is just (59:44 - 59:50)
basically a z move well snorlax changes (59:47 - 59:52)
you have two new moves after (59:50 - 59:55)
oh does it yeah oh okay if you watched (59:52 - 59:57)
there they did like a 15 second (59:55 - 59:59)
instagram thing and they showed that (59:57 - 60:00)
like (59:59 - 60:02)
when you had two different options after (60:00 - 60:04)
you gigantimaxed (60:02 - 60:05)
does the (60:04 - 60:07)
[Music] (60:05 - 60:09)
picture change does it stay in that form (60:07 - 60:10)
or does it go back to snorlax so it was (60:09 - 60:12)
a 15 second trailer and 10 of it was the (60:10 - 60:16)
animation of it doing its thing (60:12 - 60:16)
so i'm not 100 sure on that i have not (60:16 - 60:20)
pulled on these new characters yet i (60:18 - 60:22)
mean i'm out of coins so (60:20 - 60:24)
i think they're gone we get like (60:22 - 60:26)
bonus on the (60:24 - 60:29)
18th or something for retweets (60:26 - 60:30)
yeah there's like a retweet bonus we're (60:29 - 60:32)
gonna get there's a retweet bonus but i (60:30 - 60:33)
don't know i don't care about these (60:32 - 60:35)
units (60:33 - 60:37)
okay question of the week (60:35 - 60:40)
oh what okay hold on (60:37 - 60:41)
two (60:40 - 60:43)
news i was just like i'm used to we're (60:41 - 60:45)
at the 40 minute mark when we do this (60:43 - 60:47)
and it's only the 30 minute mark (60:45 - 60:48)
well you know i'm traveling can't have a (60:47 - 60:50)
superhero (60:48 - 60:52)
all right (60:50 - 60:55)
time to ask the question of the week the (60:52 - 60:58)
question of the week (60:55 - 61:00)
uh also shout out to chris for the fur (60:58 - 61:03)
fruit news and jameson and some pokemon (61:00 - 61:05)
center with the (61:03 - 61:08)
houses we'll talk about that next time (61:05 - 61:11)
halloween houses oh they're so bad yeah (61:08 - 61:15)
they're not great um (61:11 - 61:15)
all right this one is from (61:16 - 61:20)
stuart (61:18 - 61:23)
best fur fruit style (61:20 - 61:26)
none of them poodles are horrible dogs (61:23 - 61:28)
if i never see another poodle in my life (61:26 - 61:30)
i (61:28 - 61:32)
will never forget the amount of time i (61:30 - 61:34)
suffered with the poodle that i did (61:32 - 61:36)
previously have in my life they're (61:34 - 61:39)
horrible dogs (61:36 - 61:39)
they're not (61:39 - 61:43)
the the problem is and like this is the (61:40 - 61:45)
the misunderstanding that people have (61:43 - 61:48)
number one they're huge (61:45 - 61:52)
like a standard yes (61:48 - 61:52)
number two it is a water dog so if (61:52 - 61:57)
you're not giving it an opportunity to (61:55 - 62:00)
swim you've got an unhappy poodle (61:57 - 62:02)
number three when they're youthful (62:00 - 62:04)
they're still huge and they jump all (62:02 - 62:05)
over the place (62:04 - 62:07)
and you have to groom them (62:05 - 62:09)
and that's not pleasant yes you do you (62:07 - 62:11)
do need to trim them (62:09 - 62:14)
anyways debutant form is my choice it is (62:11 - 62:16)
a great form (62:14 - 62:16)
oh that's the yellow one yeah (62:17 - 62:22)
it's also got a cute hat a cute southern (62:20 - 62:24)
hat (62:22 - 62:27)
out of the plantation (62:24 - 62:27)
i like diamond i think the most i'm (62:29 - 62:33)
looking i'm looking (62:31 - 62:35)
pharaoh is pretty good i'll go with (62:33 - 62:37)
dandy because i like the hat yeah dandy (62:35 - 62:40)
is also excellent oh dandy's good too (62:37 - 62:41)
yeah i'm going to say diamond i'm going (62:40 - 62:43)
to say diamond all right (62:41 - 62:46)
uh get that branding for shining diamond (62:43 - 62:49)
apparel up there (62:46 - 62:49)
uh (62:50 - 62:55)
and then uh off our youtube (62:52 - 62:57)
this is from uh (62:55 - 63:00)
w lord what is will knitting (62:57 - 63:02)
we already went through that (63:00 - 63:05)
we've mentioned this many times (63:02 - 63:09)
it's a blanket it is a blanket for who (63:05 - 63:11)
the the destination unknown (63:09 - 63:16)
okay maybe it's just for me (63:11 - 63:16)
uh raymond from youtube says what do you (63:19 - 63:22)
think of the vibrant pokey tunes (63:21 - 63:24)
available on youtube and why don't you (63:22 - 63:25)
talk or comment about them last three (63:24 - 63:27)
episodes were so much fun (63:25 - 63:28)
why don't they produce fully animated (63:27 - 63:31)
series like this at this level (63:28 - 63:33)
uh i mean i have watched them they are (63:31 - 63:35)
very much fun they aren't in english (63:33 - 63:36)
which is something why we haven't really (63:35 - 63:38)
talked about them about i've never even (63:36 - 63:39)
heard of whatever they're they're (63:38 - 63:41)
exclusive the japanese right um youtube (63:39 - 63:43)
channel that's why you're getting those (63:41 - 63:45)
they're like done in the old like mickey (63:43 - 63:46)
mouse style (63:45 - 63:47)
ah (63:46 - 63:48)
[Music] (63:47 - 63:50)
they have been very i mean they've been (63:48 - 63:51)
very good and even (63:50 - 63:54)
i think they've now added the (63:51 - 63:57)
english sub titles i think (63:54 - 63:59)
they've added in but and if you don't (63:57 - 64:01)
understand japanese like i do (63:59 - 64:02)
not (64:01 - 64:04)
uh (64:02 - 64:06)
you can get enough context clues to know (64:04 - 64:07)
what's going on and they're super cute (64:06 - 64:09)
like they're really well done they are (64:07 - 64:14)
very cute very well done um (64:09 - 64:14)
from my experience the reason we don't (64:16 - 64:22)
focus too much on like the animation (64:18 - 64:24)
stuff on the show (64:22 - 64:27)
uh (64:24 - 64:27)
is like that the timing of it always (64:28 - 64:32)
just feels off (64:30 - 64:34)
where (64:32 - 64:36)
like we'll talk we we could talk about (64:34 - 64:38)
it like we did this we tried this with (64:36 - 64:39)
the um (64:38 - 64:41)
was it evolutions (64:39 - 64:44)
generations generations (64:41 - 64:47)
where we were covering it every week (64:44 - 64:47)
and it just (64:48 - 64:54)
it just felt like 10 to 15 dead minutes (64:50 - 64:56)
well it's hard to talk about a visual (64:54 - 64:57)
medium (64:56 - 65:00)
that's in an audience (64:57 - 65:00)
like (65:00 - 65:03)
you don't know what we're looking at (65:00 - 65:05)
and (65:03 - 65:05)
i mean it'd be it would be more useful (65:06 - 65:11)
to be like okay we're setting aside a (65:09 - 65:13)
streaming night to everybody hit play (65:11 - 65:16)
together and we'll talk about it (65:13 - 65:18)
then to see like oh (65:16 - 65:21)
hopefully you watch this if not pause (65:18 - 65:24)
everything go watch this for 15 minutes (65:21 - 65:25)
then come back and see what we're (65:24 - 65:27)
talking about right because it's like (65:25 - 65:29)
it's because it's not news (65:27 - 65:30)
right (65:29 - 65:32)
so we're like describing something that (65:30 - 65:34)
you have to watch (65:32 - 65:36)
so like that is just better youtube (65:34 - 65:38)
content (65:36 - 65:40)
than podcast content (65:38 - 65:42)
and it's like well the show's on youtube (65:40 - 65:44)
that's why i commented like totally get (65:42 - 65:46)
that yeah but like the majority of our (65:44 - 65:47)
listeners are audio only so it's just (65:46 - 65:49)
it's just it's always been weird in (65:47 - 65:51)
podcast form (65:49 - 65:54)
um i mean i will say (65:51 - 65:56)
they have they're very good they are (65:54 - 65:57)
enjoyable (65:56 - 65:59)
well done the art styles are great i (65:57 - 66:01)
would highly suggest watching them (65:59 - 66:03)
especially now that you can get english (66:01 - 66:05)
subtitles (66:03 - 66:06)
ah (66:05 - 66:10)
uh watch them they're super charming but (66:06 - 66:12)
i don't know what else to say beyond (66:10 - 66:14)
that like yeah i think that i i think (66:12 - 66:15)
it's it's what i plan to do with the (66:14 - 66:17)
next the rest of evolutions is just kind (66:15 - 66:19)
of do those youtube reactions (66:17 - 66:21)
and it would probably be good for that (66:19 - 66:23)
um yeah because like like i said we've (66:21 - 66:25)
kind of done that stuff in the past and (66:23 - 66:26)
it just doesn't it feels like it really (66:25 - 66:28)
falls flat um (66:26 - 66:31)
podcast audio only wise it feels very (66:28 - 66:34)
much because it's so visual (66:31 - 66:34)
uh but that's a good question super good (66:35 - 66:40)
question uh will pokemon of the week all (66:37 - 66:43)
right last week's pokemon all you need (66:40 - 66:44)
number one (66:43 - 66:46)
i said the japanese name of the pokemon (66:44 - 66:49)
in the clue so all you needed was a (66:46 - 66:50)
little (66:49 - 66:52)
effort towards bulbapedia where they (66:50 - 66:54)
list the japanese names of the pokemon (66:52 - 66:56)
and you would have gotten it but i also (66:54 - 66:59)
used other japanese words including (66:56 - 67:02)
the word for cooking (66:59 - 67:02)
the word for water (67:02 - 67:08)
the word for ice (67:05 - 67:10)
and i also said (67:08 - 67:11)
make sure to (67:10 - 67:14)
check for a pearl in the shell before (67:11 - 67:17)
serving (67:14 - 67:17)
so who's that pokemon (67:17 - 67:22)
it's (67:19 - 67:25)
cloister (67:22 - 67:25)
oh (67:26 - 67:33)
[Laughter] (67:28 - 67:33)
gotcha got him got him (67:35 - 67:41)
i had to be wrong right (67:38 - 67:43)
it's cloistered it's cloister oh wait it (67:41 - 67:46)
is yes (67:43 - 67:46)
i thought it was clam pearl that's why i (67:47 - 67:51)
said kleister (67:49 - 67:57)
here for all of you clamped her eyes (67:51 - 67:57)
there's only one clam that is water ice (67:58 - 68:05)
and that is cloister this is such a (68:03 - 68:08)
train wreck ah yes (68:05 - 68:09)
i was just like (68:08 - 68:12)
how dare you pick something safe like (68:09 - 68:13)
munchlax (68:12 - 68:16)
well i was like oh steve was close it (68:13 - 68:19)
was clam for almost okay (68:16 - 68:21)
i had the clamp roll page open i was (68:19 - 68:23)
about to read its trivia (68:21 - 68:27)
well you were wrong (68:23 - 68:27)
i mean at least he was wrong in some way (68:27 - 68:33)
just not oh my gosh (68:29 - 68:35)
cloister is tied with mega slobro for (68:33 - 68:38)
the highest defense of all water type (68:35 - 68:39)
pokemon (68:38 - 68:41)
slobro's tail has an attached shelter (68:39 - 68:45)
which engulfs it during mega evolution (68:41 - 68:48)
they may have intended this parallel (68:45 - 68:50)
cloister and its pre-evolution share the (68:48 - 68:52)
same category with clam pearl they're (68:50 - 68:57)
all known as the bivalve pokemon (68:52 - 68:57)
uh good shiny enclosure (68:58 - 69:03)
very good shiny (69:01 - 69:05)
uh (69:03 - 69:07)
also a pretty good shuffle like (69:05 - 69:08)
it's rare that they do the entire (69:07 - 69:11)
