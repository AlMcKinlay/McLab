what's up everyone welcome to the (0:25 - 0:31)
432nd episode of the pokemon podcast (0:28 - 0:35)
it's super effective i am your host sbj (0:31 - 0:39)
with me greg hello uh i do need to share (0:35 - 0:42)
with the world uh my (0:39 - 0:45)
current pain and i'm i'm talking to you (0:42 - 0:49)
australia for the entire country (0:45 - 0:51)
all of australia they are all complicit (0:49 - 0:52)
in this (0:51 - 0:55)
brent has discovered a new (0:52 - 0:58)
streaming app that has allowed him to (0:55 - 0:59)
watch (0:58 - 1:02)
masterchef australia season one (0:59 - 1:06)
it is an unfathomable (1:02 - 1:10)
72 episode long season (1:06 - 1:13)
oh man 72 (1:10 - 1:17)
episodes and the theme song they have (1:13 - 1:20)
playing is the worst song (1:17 - 1:23)
i have ever heard in my life (1:20 - 1:26)
isn't it no i wish (1:23 - 1:28)
i didn't even think for all i know it's (1:26 - 1:30)
not even the original song it's whatever (1:28 - 1:31)
they put on after (1:30 - 1:33)
like years later like that person's like (1:31 - 1:35)
no i'm gonna charge you a lot of money (1:33 - 1:37)
to play that internationally (1:35 - 1:40)
it is atrocious and it is an ear worm (1:37 - 1:42)
and it is stuck in my head and i don't (1:40 - 1:43)
want it there (1:42 - 1:46)
so australia one at most (1:43 - 1:50)
a season should be 23 episodes not 72 (1:46 - 1:52)
talk to your international and (1:50 - 1:54)
distribution and say (1:52 - 1:56)
just have silence silence to start the (1:54 - 1:57)
show (1:56 - 2:00)
just gentle pictures of people also they (1:57 - 2:01)
have the (2:00 - 2:03)
contestants doing the stupidest things (2:01 - 2:04)
at one point one of the contestants (2:03 - 2:06)
kisses a fish (2:04 - 2:09)
why nobody knows hey hey the fish is (2:06 - 2:10)
dead (2:09 - 2:12)
oh (2:10 - 2:12)
will is here i only need to complain (2:14 - 2:18)
about (2:18 - 2:21)
whoever in the pokemon world didn't (2:18 - 2:22)
watch jurassic (2:21 - 2:26)
park stop with all the amore (2:22 - 2:29)
no yeah they're not suited for this (2:26 - 2:30)
world (2:29 - 2:33)
they're so beautiful though they're (2:30 - 2:36)
why do you think i'm shiny hunting them (2:33 - 2:38)
but i'm real busy with other things (2:36 - 2:40)
right now that's all this show is just (2:38 - 2:41)
like you guys building up your (2:40 - 2:43)
complaints for a week and then (2:41 - 2:46)
airing them wow that's what you bring us (2:43 - 2:46)
on for (2:46 - 2:48)
oh it's true also if you didn't give us (2:46 - 2:50)
so much to complain about it wouldn't be (2:48 - 2:51)
so easy (2:50 - 2:54)
and if you weren't just a sellout shill (2:51 - 2:55)
we wouldn't have to present the other (2:54 - 2:57)
side of the argument (2:55 - 3:00)
steve i i'm not even sure what you're (2:57 - 3:02)
referring to (3:00 - 3:06)
this is that we could be going down for (3:02 - 3:07)
this (3:06 - 3:10)
all right we got a loaded show for you (3:07 - 3:10)
all (3:10 - 3:12)
mostly going to be talking about the (3:10 - 3:14)
crown tundra (3:12 - 3:17)
we will not be talking about story (3:14 - 3:19)
spoilers for the crown tundra although (3:17 - 3:21)
it is very short uh i guess we'll talk (3:19 - 3:22)
about the story next week (3:21 - 3:25)
um unless you're stuck in (3:22 - 3:28)
dynamic adventure or resetting for a (3:25 - 3:29)
reggie (3:28 - 3:32)
i probably have done the story it's not (3:29 - 3:34)
like terribly long (3:32 - 3:37)
i think it's i think it's longer than (3:34 - 3:38)
isle of armor though (3:37 - 3:40)
well isle of armor i guess this is not a (3:38 - 3:42)
spoiler (3:40 - 3:44)
armor is like one note it's like here's (3:42 - 3:46)
the cub food do the cub food this is (3:44 - 3:47)
like (3:46 - 3:49)
we have four things to investigate which (3:47 - 3:50)
one do you want to investigate in which (3:49 - 3:51)
order (3:50 - 3:55)
so if if boy isle of armor took me like (3:51 - 3:57)
20 hours (3:55 - 3:58)
so this is basically gonna take me the (3:57 - 4:01)
rest of the year it is okay (3:58 - 4:03)
set aside some time i've i've played a (4:01 - 4:04)
lot i (4:03 - 4:07)
have it came out on friday (4:04 - 4:10)
i've put 20 hours into it in the last 48 (4:07 - 4:11)
hours (4:10 - 4:13)
i think it's a pretty good amount of (4:11 - 4:16)
time i think i have things to say (4:13 - 4:18)
i guess we're where do we want to start (4:16 - 4:20)
do we want to just start with dynamics (4:18 - 4:22)
adventure or do we want to start with (4:20 - 4:25)
general impressions let's do general (4:22 - 4:26)
impressions okay (4:25 - 4:28)
my first impression is for some reason i (4:26 - 4:29)
thought it was going to be an island (4:28 - 4:31)
again (4:29 - 4:31)
it clearly says it's a tundra yeah i i (4:32 - 4:37)
guess it was just kind of weird seeing (4:35 - 4:39)
the train do you expect steve to know (4:37 - 4:41)
what tundra means (4:39 - 4:43)
we live in the tundra it was just like (4:41 - 4:45)
oh we're we're taking the train (4:43 - 4:48)
to the thing and it's connected to the (4:45 - 4:49)
map (4:48 - 4:51)
already so that's wait didn't we take (4:49 - 4:53)
the train to the isle of armor though no (4:51 - 4:54)
cause no i gotta fly (4:53 - 4:58)
you gotta (4:54 - 4:58)
yeah yeah you go under the tunnel the (5:00 - 5:05)
non-existent tunnel between the isle of (5:03 - 5:05)
armor and (5:05 - 5:07)
it's like the english channel oh we did (5:05 - 5:09)
take a train to the alamo yeah you take (5:07 - 5:10)
a train yeah because the scientist (5:09 - 5:12)
ladies in the (5:10 - 5:13)
train station yeah but how does the (5:12 - 5:15)
train get there (5:13 - 5:18)
underground like the channel yeah (5:15 - 5:22)
uh i don't you guys can go um i'm still (5:18 - 5:24)
jarred about the (5:22 - 5:27)
not being an island so i would say the (5:24 - 5:31)
okay the things that kind of got me one (5:27 - 5:33)
the the top thing is i don't understand (5:31 - 5:34)
why there's a (5:33 - 5:37)
band of unless this is probably (5:34 - 5:38)
explained at some point in the story i (5:37 - 5:40)
haven't gotten to a band of snow (5:38 - 5:42)
in the south and a band of snow in the (5:40 - 5:43)
north (5:42 - 5:48)
but there's like warm areas on either (5:43 - 5:51)
side of both of them yeah (5:48 - 5:55)
i like the layout i i very much uh (5:51 - 5:57)
just kind of like the the terrain (5:55 - 5:58)
because one of my complaints (5:57 - 6:01)
of of of uh of galler is just that the (5:58 - 6:02)
routes are too short (6:01 - 6:06)
right so this is giving me like a really (6:02 - 6:10)
good area of and twists and turns and (6:06 - 6:12)
things to explore (6:10 - 6:15)
and i i'm happy with the pokemon that (6:12 - 6:15)
they've added (6:15 - 6:18)
i'm not happy that chespin is not one of (6:15 - 6:20)
them (6:18 - 6:22)
which was my one of my goals for this i (6:20 - 6:24)
think i remember (6:22 - 6:26)
my uncle at nintendo say if they brought (6:24 - 6:28)
chestnut over they would have had to (6:26 - 6:30)
strike the meteor back down and gather (6:28 - 6:33)
to kill all the fossils again (6:30 - 6:34)
oh you can't have them all living at (6:33 - 6:37)
once there you go (6:34 - 6:40)
the story is a little goofy but that's (6:37 - 6:41)
okay (6:40 - 6:44)
uh i'm i i've just been having fun i i (6:41 - 6:45)
decided that (6:44 - 6:48)
i first was going to do an all-star team (6:45 - 6:48)
so (6:48 - 6:51)
i went into pokemon home tm and just (6:48 - 6:52)
looked at my (6:51 - 6:53)
highest leveled pokemon and i was like (6:52 - 6:55)
oh these are the pokemon i played in (6:53 - 6:56)
previous games (6:55 - 6:58)
and i was like i'm going to grab my (6:56 - 6:59)
favorite ones of these and make a team (6:58 - 7:00)
out of them (6:59 - 7:03)
like like all all-time well you have to (7:00 - 7:04)
have six pokemon to play (7:03 - 7:07)
what there's the game zero trainer (7:04 - 7:08)
battles (7:07 - 7:10)
but but i'm still gonna run and (7:08 - 7:11)
encounter different (7:10 - 7:13)
wait there is a tree you walk out of the (7:11 - 7:15)
train station and you have to battle the (7:13 - 7:15)
dude (7:15 - 7:19)
yeah but then that what hydrogen it (7:15 - 7:21)
turns out wasn't doing too good (7:19 - 7:24)
uh so we put those guys away (7:21 - 7:27)
and now i have a team that is all ultra (7:24 - 7:28)
beasts (7:27 - 7:32)
and that is a lot of fun (7:28 - 7:34)
and extremely creepy because when you (7:32 - 7:36)
have ultra beasts following you in the (7:34 - 7:40)
in the overworld boy did they decide to (7:36 - 7:43)
creep out the animations for those guys (7:40 - 7:45)
i want my talent (7:43 - 7:46)
oh you know what's fun it's like when (7:45 - 7:49)
you stop walking talonflame like lands (7:46 - 7:49)
behind you (7:49 - 7:51)
sits there and then yells at you just (7:49 - 7:54)
like my cat that's why talonflame had to (7:51 - 7:55)
go away (7:54 - 7:58)
um and then i would say the (7:55 - 7:59)
one story thing i will not give any (7:58 - 8:01)
specifics but i did walk into somebody's (7:59 - 8:03)
house and i was like (8:01 - 8:07)
how does they have that pokemon (8:03 - 8:11)
what that was my exact reaction (8:07 - 8:12)
i don't think i think it's a spoiler (8:11 - 8:14)
it's literally (8:12 - 8:16)
pretty it's not like hidden behind (8:14 - 8:17)
anything well but for (8:16 - 8:19)
somebody who hasn't played the game at (8:17 - 8:21)
all they i also want them to have the (8:19 - 8:22)
reaction of (8:21 - 8:25)
how did what that pokemon okay that's (8:22 - 8:26)
fair (8:25 - 8:28)
so there you go the map is very cool but (8:26 - 8:29)
i get lost (8:28 - 8:33)
all the time uh and i want for is (8:29 - 8:34)
more than on the isle of armor i want a (8:33 - 8:36)
mini map for this one because i can't (8:34 - 8:37)
tell (8:36 - 8:40)
where i am because because of the weird (8:37 - 8:43)
band of snow and there's multiple (8:40 - 8:46)
points of access i get lost all the time (8:43 - 8:48)
um i like the story i think the story is (8:46 - 8:50)
better than isle of armor so i'm happy (8:48 - 8:51)
there (8:50 - 8:54)
all of it or which part of like the (8:51 - 8:54)
multiple (8:54 - 8:57)
paths are you going all right uh i will (8:54 - 8:58)
say legendary story one (8:57 - 9:02)
which is the one i've completed i think (8:58 - 9:05)
i think it's very pretty like (9:02 - 9:08)
i do think it looks great (9:05 - 9:11)
um even like they took even better than (9:08 - 9:13)
the isle of armor i just think it looks (9:11 - 9:16)
very good i am slightly disappointed (9:13 - 9:18)
i just sort of felt like you could have (9:16 - 9:19)
added (9:18 - 9:23)
more missing pokemon than you did (9:19 - 9:25)
that feels a little well the problem is (9:23 - 9:26)
to me (9:25 - 9:28)
the 100 pokemon they added like 60 of (9:26 - 9:30)
them are either legendaries or ultra (9:28 - 9:31)
beasts (9:30 - 9:34)
right so it's so then when you have like (9:31 - 9:35)
neato king and nidoqueen you're like (9:34 - 9:36)
well that's another (9:35 - 9:39)
six yeah i mean it's just like the (9:36 - 9:42)
walking around in the real world there's (9:39 - 9:44)
a lot of ones that i've already seen (9:42 - 9:44)
before (9:44 - 9:46)
and that's a little that was just a (9:44 - 9:48)
little it's not terrible (9:46 - 9:50)
but i'm like you could have you could (9:48 - 9:52)
have easily added (9:50 - 9:55)
more of the old ones here and had those (9:52 - 9:56)
been (9:55 - 9:59)
a bigger surprise than like (9:56 - 10:03)
zubat is back and (9:59 - 10:06)
as awful as ever yeah somebody if (10:03 - 10:08)
somebody had that company love zubat (10:06 - 10:12)
i i don't know why or who but stop (10:08 - 10:14)
stop it's just stop don't worry if (10:12 - 10:15)
they're gonna keep to their word of (10:14 - 10:17)
not every pokemon will be in every (10:15 - 10:21)
pokemon game going forward maybe (10:17 - 10:21)
make the cut so i think (10:24 - 10:30)
that i think this sort of the lack of (10:27 - 10:31)
added in pokemon was a little (10:30 - 10:33)
disappointing i think (10:31 - 10:35)
everything's beautiful there are there (10:33 - 10:37)
are things that i did in there that i (10:35 - 10:38)
didn't expect and they were big (10:37 - 10:39)
surprises (10:38 - 10:43)
um i don't know like you can shake (10:39 - 10:45)
every tree no matter their size and (10:43 - 10:46)
things will happen (10:45 - 10:50)
mm-hmm and that was like (10:46 - 10:52)
yeah that was a fun surprise i one thing (10:50 - 10:54)
i also wanted to say now that (10:52 - 10:55)
it just came to mind is i wish they (10:54 - 10:57)
would just stop (10:55 - 11:00)
reformat the games stop doing character (10:57 - 11:01)
animations (11:00 - 11:03)
because you guys obviously don't (11:01 - 11:05)
understand how humans move (11:03 - 11:09)
or interact with each other so please (11:05 - 11:12)
it's it's it's creepy and disturbing (11:09 - 11:13)
the the thing that i couldn't help (11:12 - 11:15)
notice is like this is (11:13 - 11:19)
in the original wild area (11:15 - 11:22)
there is the you know the initial same (11:19 - 11:24)
complaints got lost very big (11:22 - 11:26)
love it confusing wish there was a map i (11:24 - 11:28)
think this applies to every new area but (11:26 - 11:30)
there are no like houses (11:28 - 11:32)
in that and technically the olive armor (11:30 - 11:34)
is all considered a wild area (11:32 - 11:37)
and there's only one house just the dojo (11:34 - 11:37)
right (11:37 - 11:39)
oh there's a house and then there's the (11:37 - 11:44)
two two towers the two towers (11:39 - 11:47)
and then never again yeah but i will say (11:44 - 11:49)
they are good markers (11:47 - 11:50)
they are good markers and then they they (11:49 - 11:53)
did a little village in the crown tundra (11:50 - 11:54)
which is like oh cool maybe we're (11:53 - 11:57)
getting closer to having (11:54 - 11:58)
this as being the norm and i think (11:57 - 12:00)
that's kind of what a lot of people are (11:58 - 12:03)
are hoping for or reaching for is they (12:00 - 12:04)
want (12:03 - 12:08)
the whole game to be wild area (12:04 - 12:09)
however you describe that that's the (12:08 - 12:11)
best i could describe it i don't know (12:09 - 12:13)
oh they want the game to be open world (12:11 - 12:15)
but that little village is (12:13 - 12:20)
like like three houses and four people (12:15 - 12:20)
it's four houses there's one point where (12:20 - 12:25)
the game tells you like talk to all the (12:23 - 12:26)
villagers (12:25 - 12:29)
yeah and you're like oh the three like i (12:26 - 12:30)
gotta talk to betty and (12:29 - 12:32)
shirley over here and then i gotta talk (12:30 - 12:34)
to them there's still one that i missed (12:32 - 12:35)
and i was like (12:34 - 12:37)
where is this i i swear i've talked to (12:35 - 12:39)
it oh it's because they used the same (12:37 - 12:42)
character model for three of you yeah (12:39 - 12:45)
yep it's like it's not the person that's (12:42 - 12:46)
just sitting there that's not (12:45 - 12:49)
okay they can do 800 plus pokemon models (12:46 - 12:50)
but (12:49 - 12:53)
time and time again we're only allowed (12:50 - 12:53)
12 (12:53 - 12:56)
character mods we have we have long (12:53 - 12:57)
since determined (12:56 - 13:00)
that triplets quadruplets are (12:57 - 13:03)
very very common in the pokemon world uh (13:00 - 13:05)
i like peony a lot though (13:03 - 13:07)
um i do too he is very cringe-worthy in (13:05 - 13:09)
like the good ways (13:07 - 13:12)
yeah the daughter uh like not as (13:09 - 13:13)
memorable to me (13:12 - 13:16)
i think well she's there (13:13 - 13:19)
very briefly well she's always in the (13:16 - 13:21)
cave telling you that she'll (13:19 - 13:23)
heggle you a legendary for five die (13:21 - 13:25)
right or (13:23 - 13:28)
die night ores she gave me a (13:25 - 13:31)
an item yeah this is actually the thing (13:28 - 13:33)
i i'm a little disappointed and not that (13:31 - 13:34)
big of a deal but when you uh (13:33 - 13:36)
unlock the isle the crown the isle of (13:34 - 13:39)
armor the owl of crown tundra the olive (13:36 - 13:39)
armor (13:39 - 13:41)
um you just can't just go back to the (13:39 - 13:43)
old stores and buy (13:41 - 13:48)
the new clothing but there's no (13:43 - 13:50)
shopping pass in the crown tundra it (13:48 - 13:52)
seems like the main way to get clothing (13:50 - 13:52)
is (13:52 - 13:54)
in between dynamaxx adventures you have (13:52 - 13:57)
to remember to talk to her (13:54 - 13:59)
yeah she will give you clothing items in (13:57 - 14:00)
between she'll be like oh i found this (13:59 - 14:02)
on the floor i don't like it here's (14:00 - 14:06)
for you so if you want like team flares (14:02 - 14:09)
goggles or get i (14:06 - 14:11)
i haven't talked to her enough she gives (14:09 - 14:12)
you all that but you have to remember to (14:11 - 14:14)
talk to her in between (14:12 - 14:16)
and if she says like i have a landorus (14:14 - 14:18)
for five dinite ore (14:16 - 14:20)
you can say no and then talk to her (14:18 - 14:21)
again and then she'll be like i found (14:20 - 14:22)
this (14:21 - 14:25)
uh hat would you like it (14:22 - 14:27)
oh i was only talking to her once (14:25 - 14:29)
between raids i will keep talking yeah (14:27 - 14:31)
every every time in between just talk to (14:29 - 14:32)
her i (14:31 - 14:35)
honestly thought by the style of her (14:32 - 14:36)
hair (14:35 - 14:39)
that she was more tied to the legend of (14:36 - 14:40)
this (14:39 - 14:44)
pass than she is i don't wait what's the (14:40 - 14:45)
what's the issue (14:44 - 14:47)
that i mean peony wants to do dynamex (14:45 - 14:49)
adventure (14:47 - 14:51)
yeah and she wants to do dynamics (14:49 - 14:52)
adventure but she doesn't want to do it (14:51 - 14:53)
with him is that just though that's (14:52 - 14:56)
the whole no no no no no no no no he (14:53 - 14:59)
wants to do the legendary tour did you (14:56 - 15:00)
not see his (14:59 - 15:03)
child like so (15:00 - 15:06)
he planned out an entire tour of the (15:03 - 15:07)
entire (15:06 - 15:09)
crown tundra to do all of these things (15:07 - 15:10)
and (15:09 - 15:12)
she did not include the dynomax (15:10 - 15:13)
adventure (15:12 - 15:15)
because she thinks it's too dangerous oh (15:13 - 15:16)
okay okay okay (15:15 - 15:18)
only wants to do dynamics adventures so (15:16 - 15:20)
she pawns (15:18 - 15:22)
her dad off on you yeah i literally when (15:20 - 15:24)
i first met her (15:22 - 15:26)
and she turned around and she has that (15:24 - 15:27)
bulbous (15:26 - 15:31)
crown like hairstyle i thought oh she's (15:27 - 15:32)
tied (15:31 - 15:34)
she's gonna be the one that's gonna (15:32 - 15:36)
start off this whole (15:34 - 15:38)
this whole legendary kale rick's (15:36 - 15:39)
adventure (15:38 - 15:43)
and nope she just sits in a cave (15:39 - 15:45)
uh do we wanna talk about dynamics (15:43 - 15:47)
adventure (15:45 - 15:49)
yeah i mean it's what i've spent most of (15:47 - 15:52)
my time doing in the ground tundra (15:49 - 15:55)
yeah i have done um i've done about (15:52 - 15:58)
24 25 dynamics adventures (15:55 - 16:01)
uh which is a lot a lot it's (15:58 - 16:05)
four like four pokemon times 25 is a (16:01 - 16:07)
hundred so i guess i've seen 100 pokemon (16:05 - 16:08)
at this point (16:07 - 16:10)
so it is a little bit different than we (16:08 - 16:12)
thought it was going to be (16:10 - 16:16)
um i was expecting like four to five (16:12 - 16:18)
pokemon before legendary it's a hard (16:16 - 16:19)
three (16:18 - 16:21)
yep it looks like more because of the (16:19 - 16:23)
the branching pass but they they (16:21 - 16:25)
branch it in a way where you're only (16:23 - 16:27)
doing three the other thing (16:25 - 16:30)
is which is very different is there are (16:27 - 16:30)
no (16:30 - 16:34)
shields on these pokemon yep not even on (16:30 - 16:36)
the legendary (16:34 - 16:40)
and it they still must have i think it's (16:36 - 16:41)
because of the rentals (16:40 - 16:43)
or like i'm i'm sure all the rentals (16:41 - 16:44)
were made (16:43 - 16:47)
in in a way but the most i've ever been (16:44 - 16:48)
able to do (16:47 - 16:50)
damage wise to a single pokemon is about (16:48 - 16:51)
50 percent (16:50 - 16:53)
so it was possible to like two shot a (16:51 - 16:55)
pokemon (16:53 - 16:58)
i mean it's hard it's hard yeah but you (16:55 - 17:00)
really have to have a good like (16:58 - 17:02)
the exact right combination for that to (17:00 - 17:03)
happen (17:02 - 17:06)
even with no shields the whole process (17:03 - 17:08)
which which i was saying for a couple (17:06 - 17:10)
weeks is is is almost 20 minutes (17:08 - 17:12)
like you are it yeah from start to (17:10 - 17:14)
finish it's about 20 minutes i started i (17:12 - 17:17)
timed every one i did or for the sake of (17:14 - 17:18)
this conversation (17:17 - 17:20)
the fastest i was ever able to do it was (17:18 - 17:22)
15 minutes (17:20 - 17:24)
the longest it took me for one was 22 (17:22 - 17:26)
minutes but on average i was completing (17:24 - 17:28)
almost all of them in about 17 18 (17:26 - 17:30)
minutes and that's not counting the time (17:28 - 17:31)
it takes to get the (17:30 - 17:33)
the group together i started the timer i (17:31 - 17:36)
started the timer once we (17:33 - 17:39)
started picking our um once everyone hit (17:36 - 17:40)
ready (17:39 - 17:42)
i started the timer and you never had to (17:40 - 17:44)
play with npcs right (17:42 - 17:48)
i played with uh we had in in the 24 25 (17:44 - 17:49)
i did (17:48 - 17:52)
we had two people disconnect um and so (17:49 - 17:54)
an npc filled their slot (17:52 - 17:56)
and it was i don't know my first my (17:54 - 17:58)
first run through was all npcs i did the (17:56 - 18:00)
first one by myself because (17:58 - 18:03)
and i was like what was funny is the (18:00 - 18:04)
person that disconnected (18:03 - 18:07)
because i was streaming this on twitch (18:04 - 18:08)
they got three npcs (18:07 - 18:11)
in their place so they were still in the (18:08 - 18:12)
dynamex adventure (18:11 - 18:14)
huh and we got the one npc for that (18:12 - 18:15)
person (18:14 - 18:17)
and they were able to get to the legend (18:15 - 18:19)
and beat the legend before (18:17 - 18:22)
us well it's like (18:19 - 18:26)
the npcs either do absolutely (18:22 - 18:29)
the worst choices or they do like yeah (18:26 - 18:30)
that was a good idea (18:29 - 18:32)
thanks for coordinating and doing that (18:30 - 18:33)
the right way (18:32 - 18:36)
right they are very hit or miss uh when (18:33 - 18:38)
they are hit they're great (18:36 - 18:39)
so i know i know people want us to talk (18:38 - 18:41)
about this uh i will (18:39 - 18:44)
disclose here that there are there is a (18:41 - 18:45)
data miner (18:44 - 18:47)
this data miner has been wrong in the (18:45 - 18:49)
past this data miner has been right in (18:47 - 18:49)
the past (18:49 - 18:51)
this is the same data miner that cerabi (18:49 - 18:54)
used but they initially tweeted (18:51 - 18:57)
that um dynamics adventure had no (18:54 - 18:58)
increased (18:57 - 19:01)
shiny odds based on the player id (18:58 - 19:03)
this is getting really complicated but (19:01 - 19:05)
pretty much your player id that the game (19:03 - 19:06)
assigns you which is (19:05 - 19:07)
what you can see on your trainer card (19:06 - 19:10)
it's like probably like one one two (19:07 - 19:13)
seven six nine or whatever that number (19:10 - 19:16)
is what rolls the thing that determines (19:13 - 19:17)
a shiny (19:16 - 19:19)
and they ultimately said that like there (19:17 - 19:21)
was no extra rolls going through (19:19 - 19:23)
dynamics adventure without the shiny (19:21 - 19:24)
charm that they saw (19:23 - 19:27)
and then about an hour later they looked (19:24 - 19:28)
at a different thing (19:27 - 19:31)
and ultimately to make this easy it's (19:28 - 19:33)
pretty similar to (19:31 - 19:35)
the wormhole stuff so if you remember (19:33 - 19:37)
ultra wormholes and (19:35 - 19:40)
ultrasound ultramoon there was a base (19:37 - 19:41)
percentage i think it was a base one (19:40 - 19:42)
percent (19:41 - 19:45)
of pokemon being shiny we're talking (19:42 - 19:46)
about the 20 pokemon not the legendary (19:45 - 19:49)
pokemon so that's like the altaria the (19:46 - 19:53)
um obama snow the hip-hop (19:49 - 19:53)
sounds like you've seen some fun ones (19:54 - 19:57)
because i think i saw masculine about (19:56 - 19:59)
eight times (19:57 - 20:01)
the escalator is not in the outdoor (19:59 - 20:03)
moles (20:01 - 20:06)
no no baskins on the dynamax oh dynamics (20:03 - 20:07)
adventure yeah yeah yeah (20:06 - 20:09)
so those pokemon had a base one percent (20:07 - 20:11)
to be shiny (20:09 - 20:13)
in in the ultra wormholes but the ultra (20:11 - 20:14)
wormhole (20:13 - 20:16)
determined didn't use your shiny charm (20:14 - 20:17)
or your player id (20:16 - 20:20)
it determined how many rings the (20:17 - 20:20)
wormhole (20:20 - 20:23)
had and how far you went and it went (20:20 - 20:25)
from like one percent to like (20:23 - 20:27)
i can't remember it was like maybe 36 (20:25 - 20:29)
percent a chance of being shiny (20:27 - 20:31)
doing that so the data miner then (20:29 - 20:32)
discovered (20:31 - 20:34)
i'm only putting this disclaimer because (20:32 - 20:36)
there could be more to it there could be (20:34 - 20:38)
less to it remember we (20:36 - 20:39)
the data miner originally thought there (20:38 - 20:41)
was chaining involved with (20:39 - 20:45)
uh overworld method that with (20:41 - 20:47)
the shiny charm there is a one in a (20:45 - 20:48)
hundred chance per (20:47 - 20:50)
pokemon you encounter and you encounter (20:48 - 20:52)
four a dynamax run (20:50 - 20:54)
with your uh there's a one in a hundred (20:52 - 20:55)
chance (20:54 - 20:58)
that that pokemon will be shiny at the (20:55 - 20:59)
end (20:58 - 21:02)
of the adventure they're never they're (20:59 - 21:04)
never shiny while you're fighting them (21:02 - 21:08)
yeah everyone will have a different role (21:04 - 21:11)
at the end um so will could get shiny (21:08 - 21:12)
masculine (21:11 - 21:14)
and i could not get shiny masculine for (21:12 - 21:16)
example (21:14 - 21:18)
and if you don't have the shiny charm (21:16 - 21:19)
you have a (21:18 - 21:21)
1 in 300 chance because remember the (21:19 - 21:22)
shiny charm gives (21:21 - 21:25)
plus 2 of getting a shiny through the (21:22 - 21:26)
adventure (21:25 - 21:28)
so there is some misinformation about (21:26 - 21:30)
here where uh youtubers and (21:28 - 21:32)
other content creators are saying that (21:30 - 21:35)
it's a one in 25 chance of being shiny (21:32 - 21:38)
it's technically not true (21:35 - 21:42)
because well each encounter (21:38 - 21:45)
is a one in a hundred chance right you (21:42 - 21:46)
could (21:45 - 21:47)
i guess the way you you say that (21:46 - 21:49)
argument adventure (21:47 - 21:52)
the entire 20 minutes is a one in 25 (21:49 - 21:55)
chance yeah because if there's four (21:52 - 21:55)
chances (21:55 - 21:59)
out of a hundred basically right that (21:55 - 22:01)
one of them will be so every time you go (21:59 - 22:04)
on on a chance there's a one in 25 (22:01 - 22:07)
there's a 1025 chance that one of the (22:04 - 22:08)
four (22:07 - 22:11)
will be shiny so you're spending (22:08 - 22:14)
ultimately 20 minutes for (22:11 - 22:17)
community day odds yeah (22:14 - 22:19)
which i'm sure that was thought about (22:17 - 22:21)
right like there's it's yes (22:19 - 22:24)
um but but i was i was completely wrong (22:21 - 22:25)
in the sense that i didn't think they (22:24 - 22:27)
would do anything i just thought (22:25 - 22:29)
i thought there would be shields i (22:27 - 22:30)
thought there would be i thought it (22:29 - 22:31)
would just (22:30 - 22:33)
just like i thought everyone if it was (22:31 - 22:35)
shiny it would be shiny for everyone i (22:33 - 22:35)
thought (22:35 - 22:37)
shiny charm doesn't affect raids at the (22:35 - 22:39)
old raids (22:37 - 22:41)
so why would it affect these raids but (22:39 - 22:42)
also (22:41 - 22:44)
dynamics adventure doesn't even use y (22:42 - 22:45)
com (22:44 - 22:48)
no oh wait wait wait before we get there (22:45 - 22:50)
because we're still talking about (22:48 - 22:52)
catching and everything like that don't (22:50 - 22:55)
don't waste your good balls people (22:52 - 22:57)
yes it is guaranteed catch for (22:55 - 22:58)
everything (22:57 - 23:00)
get just poke ball premiere ball if you (22:58 - 23:02)
want to feel special (23:00 - 23:04)
yeah we there is no problem catching (23:02 - 23:06)
anything in these things (23:04 - 23:07)
that could that will come up in my list (23:06 - 23:10)
of complaints about dynamics adventures (23:07 - 23:12)
yeah for maybe somebody who hasn't (23:10 - 23:14)
purchased the dlc or maybe on the fence (23:12 - 23:18)
dynamics i love dynamics adventure (23:14 - 23:20)
i love it i love dynamics i love it a (23:18 - 23:21)
lot that i have (23:20 - 23:25)
minor minor i have minor complaints um (23:21 - 23:28)
but overall it is pretty much (23:25 - 23:32)
what i want to do every time i start up (23:28 - 23:34)
ground tundra right now i want to find (23:32 - 23:35)
people online (23:34 - 23:37)
i want to go and just like say hey let's (23:35 - 23:39)
run some let's (23:37 - 23:41)
let's run some layers let's let's see (23:39 - 23:42)
what we get because it's (23:41 - 23:46)
it's it is just really fun (23:42 - 23:48)
the fact that they added rentals so that (23:46 - 23:51)
everybody has a very specific like (23:48 - 23:54)
you aren't a level 100 power through (23:51 - 23:57)
it they're all calibrated to do very (23:54 - 23:58)
specific things (23:57 - 24:01)
you have to think of strategy you have (23:58 - 24:02)
to look at their moves (24:01 - 24:04)
you have to look at the layer and sort (24:02 - 24:07)
of plan out will this get me to the end (24:04 - 24:10)
like all of that is really exciting it's (24:07 - 24:12)
really exciting to like (24:10 - 24:15)
have like this minor puzzle of how to do (24:12 - 24:17)
this layer successfully (24:15 - 24:19)
you have to argue with your friends (24:17 - 24:20)
because they (24:19 - 24:22)
chose the wrong path or they didn't say (24:20 - 24:24)
what path they needed to do (24:22 - 24:27)
fast enough in that daggone ten second (24:24 - 24:29)
time (24:27 - 24:31)
it's real short and it's like 10 seconds (24:29 - 24:32)
to pick a path (24:31 - 24:34)
10 seconds to pick an item if you come (24:32 - 24:36)
across a backpacker oh and (24:34 - 24:38)
rando scientists could you possibly (24:36 - 24:40)
mention (24:38 - 24:40)
could you just tell me which one you (24:41 - 24:45)
have the first time that happened i was (24:43 - 24:47)
ready to turn around (24:45 - 24:50)
i don't get violent but man that was i i (24:47 - 24:52)
was heading towards a water legendary i (24:50 - 24:54)
had an electric (24:52 - 24:57)
and the scientist said oh hey i have (24:54 - 24:58)
something to switch out and i was like (24:57 - 25:01)
well i haven't seen this before so sure (24:58 - 25:03)
uh and it gave me a poison type but i'm (25:01 - 25:04)
like sure sure (25:03 - 25:06)
this is absolutely the thing i do not (25:04 - 25:08)
need to finish this (25:06 - 25:11)
this layer uh never again (25:08 - 25:15)
i will say that as as a real (25:11 - 25:18)
sign of like approval of of the dynamics (25:15 - 25:19)
adventure part (25:18 - 25:22)
i mean i i literally sat for five (25:19 - 25:25)
hours yesterday non-stop just doing (25:22 - 25:27)
dynamaxx (25:25 - 25:30)
advice that is how much i enjoy doing (25:27 - 25:31)
them (25:30 - 25:34)
i have complaints of course i do oh i (25:31 - 25:35)
was just gonna explain what it was real (25:34 - 25:37)
quick for people who haven't oh sure (25:35 - 25:40)
go for it so uh uh when you (25:37 - 25:43)
when you go into dynamics adventure you (25:40 - 25:46)
can either partner up with uh (25:43 - 25:48)
npcs or you could just partner up random (25:46 - 25:50)
if you wanted to (25:48 - 25:52)
always get a group of real people you (25:50 - 25:54)
could probably type in six nine six nine (25:52 - 25:56)
six nine six nine or one one 11111 (25:54 - 25:59)
because um unlike why com it doesn't (25:56 - 26:01)
need people on your friends list right (25:59 - 26:04)
so you can just you can just type in a (26:01 - 26:05)
number (26:04 - 26:07)
um and then match with other people that (26:05 - 26:09)
have typed in that same number (26:07 - 26:12)
think of it more like uh surprise trade (26:09 - 26:14)
or not surprise trade but the bling (26:12 - 26:15)
trade link trade (26:14 - 26:18)
where it was broken before uh (26:15 - 26:20)
and then they added more numbers to fix (26:18 - 26:21)
it uh and then (26:20 - 26:25)
you get then you get three pokemon (26:21 - 26:28)
that will appear three rentals uh none (26:25 - 26:29)
of them will have held items you get to (26:28 - 26:30)
see their move sets (26:29 - 26:33)
uh these pokemon there i think there are (26:30 - 26:34)
i think sarah b (26:33 - 26:37)
says there's like 260 pokemon that you (26:34 - 26:38)
can pick (26:37 - 26:43)
the like exeggutor clefairy comfey (26:38 - 26:46)
celio uh like sigiliff like there's a (26:43 - 26:47)
bunch that come through that you (26:46 - 26:48)
probably (26:47 - 26:51)
you know most people don't maybe think (26:48 - 26:53)
of using throughout their adventures or (26:51 - 26:53)
whatnot (26:53 - 26:55)
anyways you see three you pick one a new (26:53 - 26:57)
one comes in (26:55 - 26:58)
and then the other two that were still (26:57 - 27:00)
there are left over no (26:58 - 27:02)
and then wait wait wait the person who's (27:00 - 27:03)
hosting the (27:02 - 27:07)
dynamax gets to pick first yes and then (27:03 - 27:09)
it's like the order that you joined they (27:07 - 27:11)
get to then select so yeah once that (27:09 - 27:13)
person picks one it's not like well (27:11 - 27:14)
there's only two left (27:13 - 27:17)
they slot in a new yeah it's like a very (27:14 - 27:18)
card game thing where they like flip (27:17 - 27:20)
over and they slot in and then so it's a (27:18 - 27:21)
draft (27:20 - 27:23)
yeah it's drafting and then everyone (27:21 - 27:24)
picks and then (27:23 - 27:27)
usually the start is two different ways (27:24 - 27:28)
and (27:27 - 27:31)
you know what the final legend (27:28 - 27:35)
will be based on the they show you (27:31 - 27:37)
one of the types of the final legend (27:35 - 27:38)
right so (27:37 - 27:40)
like if they show you ghost or if they (27:38 - 27:42)
show you dragon or if they show you (27:40 - 27:43)
psychic (27:42 - 27:46)
you're still yeah (27:43 - 27:48)
right you can kind of maybe think of (27:46 - 27:49)
what like if they're showing flying (27:48 - 27:50)
you'd be like well it could be lugia it (27:49 - 27:52)
could be ho-oh it could be zapdos it (27:50 - 27:53)
could be (27:52 - 27:56)
rayquaza like you you know it's at least (27:53 - 27:58)
not going to be circuitry (27:56 - 28:01)
right when you get to the end and then (27:58 - 28:02)
you you could take (28:01 - 28:04)
either path and you you have to play (28:02 - 28:06)
who's that pokemon very quickly (28:04 - 28:09)
because you can see right you can see a (28:06 - 28:11)
little bit of their outline depending on (28:09 - 28:12)
how big they are (28:11 - 28:15)
in the mist that they're hidden in (28:12 - 28:17)
and then there's a couple people along (28:15 - 28:18)
the way that (28:17 - 28:21)
uh probably influences the decision more (28:18 - 28:22)
than it should there are the scientist (28:21 - 28:23)
people (28:22 - 28:25)
um and they will be the one that will (28:23 - 28:28)
say i will give you a random pokemon (28:25 - 28:30)
good luck right well it's like it's like (28:28 - 28:33)
i will trade you the one that i have (28:30 - 28:34)
although i'm not going to tell you what (28:33 - 28:36)
it is for the one that you or the one (28:34 - 28:37)
that you have (28:36 - 28:39)
there and it's a the devil's bargain (28:37 - 28:40)
don't do it (28:39 - 28:43)
there are berries on the ground all that (28:40 - 28:45)
does is replenish your health not fully (28:43 - 28:46)
uh it replenishes your health it does (28:45 - 28:48)
not remove status condition like (28:46 - 28:49)
paralysis (28:48 - 28:52)
or poison or frozen um which then leads (28:49 - 28:53)
to the point of (28:52 - 28:56)
when you walk out of your first raid (28:53 - 28:57)
battle your hp (28:56 - 29:01)
your pp your everything is is is (28:57 - 29:04)
it does not get refreshed right (29:01 - 29:08)
it it is you are stuck (29:04 - 29:10)
at with where you stopped after each (29:08 - 29:13)
raid battle so you have to carry through (29:10 - 29:16)
with the health and everything that you (29:13 - 29:16)
ended the (29:16 - 29:18)
whatever raid battle you just came out (29:16 - 29:20)
of with the exception of (29:18 - 29:23)
swapping so yeah if you walked out of a (29:20 - 29:24)
raid battle with uh (29:23 - 29:27)
like a 20 hp left machoke (29:24 - 29:29)
you might be the one that wants to take (29:27 - 29:31)
the new pokemon not because (29:29 - 29:33)
you love the new pokemon but mostly (29:31 - 29:35)
because like you will probably (29:33 - 29:38)
faint going into the next battle and (29:35 - 29:39)
it's four (29:38 - 29:42)
faints for the entire adventure not four (29:39 - 29:43)
feints per (29:42 - 29:46)
raid right which gets to the other point (29:43 - 29:47)
of (29:46 - 29:49)
if you make it to the legendary and you (29:47 - 29:50)
only have (29:49 - 29:53)
one faint left and you faint (29:50 - 29:55)
uh you get kicked out of the dynamex (29:53 - 29:57)
adventure you still have the option (29:55 - 30:00)
to cut to pick one of the three pokemon (29:57 - 30:01)
you've caught prior to that because (30:00 - 30:02)
remember you catch (30:01 - 30:05)
three non-legend pokemons before the (30:02 - 30:06)
legend (30:05 - 30:08)
but you don't you have to do the whole (30:06 - 30:10)
thing over (30:08 - 30:12)
at that point but you still walk away i (30:10 - 30:13)
guess with the consolation prize and you (30:12 - 30:14)
still (30:13 - 30:17)
walk away with dinite ore as well (30:14 - 30:18)
the other things that you can find so (30:17 - 30:20)
there are berries barry's replenished (30:18 - 30:22)
there's the scientists she swaps you (30:20 - 30:23)
normally with a masculine (30:22 - 30:27)
and then there's the uh there's the (30:23 - 30:29)
hiker the back of the girl backpacker (30:27 - 30:31)
and she's probably the best one to talk (30:29 - 30:32)
to (30:31 - 30:34)
because she will give you a held item (30:32 - 30:36)
and sometimes i held items evo (30:34 - 30:38)
light which is huge if you have like (30:36 - 30:41)
charmeleon or exeggutor or clefairy or (30:38 - 30:43)
chansey because they benefit from evil (30:41 - 30:44)
light (30:43 - 30:45)
the other thing the exeggutor does not (30:44 - 30:48)
benefit from evil oh sorry (30:45 - 30:49)
i just like saying exeggutor because i (30:48 - 30:51)
keep using him (30:49 - 30:52)
but that is that is something that i (30:51 - 30:54)
want to bring up in the (30:52 - 30:56)
rental pokemon which was this was a (30:54 - 30:58)
little unexpected for me is a lot of (30:56 - 31:01)
non-fully evolved pokemon (30:58 - 31:05)
so you may get like a middle evolution (31:01 - 31:08)
um as like what you're look (31:05 - 31:12)
i took out kirim with a combustion okay (31:08 - 31:15)
that's all i wanted to say (31:12 - 31:17)
i think those are the three right the (31:15 - 31:18)
hiker the scientists and then the (31:17 - 31:20)
berries (31:18 - 31:21)
that's all i've seen i think that's all (31:20 - 31:23)
i've seen and yeah i (31:21 - 31:27)
it's it's uh every every pokemon has a (31:23 - 31:29)
100 catch rate (31:27 - 31:30)
so you can use whatever pokeball you (31:29 - 31:32)
want on but again keep in mind that (31:30 - 31:34)
you do not know if the pokemon is shiny (31:32 - 31:36)
or you don't know if it's hidden ability (31:34 - 31:37)
well i guess you could maybe guess it (31:36 - 31:38)
was hidden ability what (31:37 - 31:41)
depending on how it well you know (31:38 - 31:42)
but you also see it when you get to (31:41 - 31:44)
choose it right i'm just saying (31:42 - 31:47)
like if you're if you really want a (31:44 - 31:49)
hidden ability (31:47 - 31:50)
g-max kingler and you were saving your (31:49 - 31:52)
lure ball for it oh (31:50 - 31:54)
you throw it and then when you get to (31:52 - 31:56)
the end you get to pick four pokemon (31:54 - 31:58)
and if you decide not to take the (31:56 - 32:00)
kingler you lose that lure ball (31:58 - 32:03)
forever yeah that's one of my complaints (32:00 - 32:06)
but also how excited was i that (32:03 - 32:09)
that they have the gigantomax pokemon in (32:06 - 32:10)
there (32:09 - 32:12)
yeah like i got a gigantic max (32:10 - 32:14)
butterfree which i didn't have (32:12 - 32:16)
because because of that so that i was (32:14 - 32:18)
super pumped for that (32:16 - 32:21)
um also shout out uh (32:18 - 32:24)
yes it's 150 dinite ore but you can now (32:21 - 32:26)
just buy these balls (32:24 - 32:29)
yep so that's pretty sweet yeah i don't (32:26 - 32:30)
think that rotates either (32:29 - 32:32)
so they've had i think they now have a (32:30 - 32:34)
way to get every pokeball (32:32 - 32:36)
if you want the apricorns you do the (32:34 - 32:38)
scam-o-matic which is a (32:36 - 32:42)
one percent or a one in one thousand (32:38 - 32:44)
chance if you want a safari ball or a (32:42 - 32:45)
sports ball (32:44 - 32:47)
which the sports ball is pretty cool we (32:45 - 32:48)
haven't had (32:47 - 32:51)
zero way to get sports ball outside of (32:48 - 32:53)
heart gold soul silver (32:51 - 32:56)
the bug catching contest and i this is (32:53 - 32:59)
the one way to get the beast ball now (32:56 - 33:01)
is to pay a hundred a hundred fifties a (32:59 - 33:02)
lot i think for beast (33:01 - 33:05)
that's a lot especially since the most (33:02 - 33:07)
i've ever gotten from a raid is (33:05 - 33:09)
ten yeah i think you can get up to (33:07 - 33:11)
twelve but i'm not sure what triggers (33:09 - 33:12)
the 12. i know that 10 is (33:11 - 33:14)
you get 8 for completing an adventure (33:12 - 33:15)
with friends (33:14 - 33:17)
yep and then you get 10 for completing (33:15 - 33:19)
an adventure with friends as long as (33:17 - 33:21)
there was no faints at all (33:19 - 33:23)
yes but i heard 12 is the most but i'm (33:21 - 33:24)
not sure how to get 12. (33:23 - 33:26)
i don't know how you get 12 i don't know (33:24 - 33:28)
what's left you take (33:26 - 33:31)
ah what yeah i don't know you don't swap (33:28 - 33:31)
out (33:31 - 33:34)
you oh it could be if you oh i don't (33:31 - 33:35)
know you don't swap out (33:34 - 33:38)
you don't take any damage that seems (33:35 - 33:41)
impossible that seems impossible that's (33:38 - 33:41)
yeah (33:41 - 33:43)
uh don't sleep on clefairy though if (33:41 - 33:45)
they present you clefairy clefairy's (33:43 - 33:47)
boss (33:45 - 33:49)
clefairy with friend guard like (33:47 - 33:51)
increases the the defense (33:49 - 33:53)
clefairy knows life dude oh clefairy is (33:51 - 33:55)
good oh (33:53 - 33:58)
cryogeneal which if you like criminal (33:55 - 33:58)
combustion or (33:58 - 34:02)
cry no cry twerkle is a great combo (33:58 - 34:05)
because cry triagonal is going to know (34:02 - 34:07)
that solar beam and not have to like (34:05 - 34:10)
spend its time charging up and it knows (34:07 - 34:13)
uh what's the one that does increases (34:10 - 34:14)
your special defense (34:13 - 34:17)
um not reflect (34:14 - 34:21)
light screen amnesia light (34:17 - 34:24)
yeah i will say uh a (34:21 - 34:27)
piece of advice on dynamaxx adventures (34:24 - 34:27)
um (34:27 - 34:28)
because i don't have a list of (34:27 - 34:30)
complaints like greg does so (34:28 - 34:33)
minor minor complaints stay with the (34:30 - 34:35)
positive um and i wish i had known this (34:33 - 34:36)
because (34:35 - 34:38)
kiram was literally the first one that i (34:36 - 34:41)
came across and now i'm like (34:38 - 34:44)
when you get to the end and you ha (34:41 - 34:46)
you're presented with your four that you (34:44 - 34:47)
caught in front of you (34:46 - 34:50)
um and you you can look at their stats (34:47 - 34:53)
right and you can check the stats and (34:50 - 34:54)
that's how you see if one of them is (34:53 - 34:56)
shiny (34:54 - 35:00)
um if you want the legendary as a shiny (34:56 - 35:03)
and it's not shiny in that run-through (35:00 - 35:04)
that you did (35:03 - 35:07)
take one of the other pokemon yep and (35:04 - 35:08)
leave the (35:07 - 35:09)
because then you can go back through and (35:08 - 35:11)
do that legendary some other time (35:09 - 35:13)
and have the opportunity so that's like (35:11 - 35:15)
how you can shiny hunt for a specific (35:13 - 35:16)
legendary (35:15 - 35:19)
and that you can save that raid so you (35:16 - 35:21)
can tell the person up front (35:19 - 35:23)
hold that as one of my three saved (35:21 - 35:25)
layers you save that path (35:23 - 35:27)
you save that path yeah and you can do (35:25 - 35:29)
this you still have to go through the (35:27 - 35:30)
entire well (35:29 - 35:32)
all the way through the up to the fourth (35:30 - 35:34)
one but yep (35:32 - 35:35)
um you don't get to just like pop (35:34 - 35:37)
straight back to kiram but (35:35 - 35:40)
still you you don't have to randomly (35:37 - 35:42)
hope that it pops up again either she'll (35:40 - 35:43)
hold on to three she'll hold on to (35:42 - 35:44)
and she can hold on to version (35:43 - 35:47)
exclusives um so (35:44 - 35:50)
like for example thundurus is exclusive (35:47 - 35:51)
to (35:50 - 35:54)
shield i think um so if you're a sword (35:51 - 35:56)
player and you join a shield raid and (35:54 - 35:56)
that (35:56 - 35:58)
that shield host takes you to (35:56 - 35:59)
thunderists you don't normally see (35:58 - 36:00)
thunderous in your game so i would (35:59 - 36:01)
recommend (36:00 - 36:03)
at the end saving the thunderous for (36:01 - 36:05)
yourself if you (36:03 - 36:06)
you know want to go back and get a (36:05 - 36:09)
certain nature or if you want to go for (36:06 - 36:10)
shiny because (36:09 - 36:12)
that this was like a very smart thing (36:10 - 36:14)
that they did (36:12 - 36:16)
is you know even if you don't care about (36:14 - 36:18)
shinies i mean obviously it seems like (36:16 - 36:19)
they built this in for people who did (36:18 - 36:21)
want to shiny hunt (36:19 - 36:24)
yep but let's say you know you just want (36:21 - 36:25)
an (36:24 - 36:28)
adamant whatever adamant (36:25 - 36:29)
solgaleo i don't even think that's the (36:28 - 36:32)
break nature but (36:29 - 36:34)
when you go through and your soul (36:32 - 36:36)
galileo's timid you can say like i'll (36:34 - 36:36)
pass on it (36:36 - 36:41)
um i'm waiting for this (36:36 - 36:43)
uh so you have you have the option to do (36:41 - 36:44)
that (36:43 - 36:48)
as well um you pick one at the end (36:44 - 36:49)
i think i think we talked about all the (36:48 - 36:52)
mechanics of it yeah (36:49 - 36:54)
i think so i can't think of anything (36:52 - 36:55)
left off (36:54 - 36:59)
like i like the con i i like that (36:55 - 37:01)
it's like a it's like a win and lose (36:59 - 37:03)
situation i like that (37:01 - 37:04)
you can just do it in the cave you just (37:03 - 37:06)
go to the cave yep (37:04 - 37:07)
everything's there you don't have to (37:06 - 37:09)
explore walk around you just (37:07 - 37:11)
get back in line say i'm looking for (37:09 - 37:12)
more people (37:11 - 37:16)
queue me up let's go but (37:12 - 37:19)
i do like the exploring of the other (37:16 - 37:20)
dens (37:19 - 37:22)
but also i have no desire to do the (37:20 - 37:25)
other dens because (37:22 - 37:28)
i just don't i mean i've done the other (37:25 - 37:29)
day the other days are so fun there's (37:28 - 37:30)
still things out there that i haven't (37:29 - 37:33)
yeah i think right into (37:30 - 37:35)
i if if if the pokemon company was to do (37:33 - 37:37)
like another wailord weekend or another (37:35 - 37:39)
clefable weekend or another pikachu (37:37 - 37:40)
weekend i (37:39 - 37:41)
i think those are fun and i think that's (37:40 - 37:44)
good um yeah it's just you know if if (37:41 - 37:45)
somebody at this point (37:44 - 37:46)
has played through the base game has (37:45 - 37:48)
played through the isle of armor (37:46 - 37:50)
there's not a lot of new pokemon to do (37:48 - 37:52)
those dens for (37:50 - 37:53)
like i can't see the needle kings i can (37:52 - 37:56)
see the amoras i can see the kabutos (37:53 - 37:59)
ex in the wild and the zubats (37:56 - 38:03)
and i'm not sure what i would need to go (37:59 - 38:05)
to a den for at this point i have all (38:03 - 38:07)
the gigantic pokemon i (38:05 - 38:09)
you know maybe maybe if i was hidden (38:07 - 38:10)
ability hunting something (38:09 - 38:12)
yeah it was hidden below honey but there (38:10 - 38:14)
are because everything's still weather (38:12 - 38:15)
based (38:14 - 38:18)
there are some like that i didn't see in (38:15 - 38:18)
the over (38:18 - 38:22)
world that i did run into fossil pokemon (38:18 - 38:25)
in raid guns and i did do those so (38:22 - 38:27)
they were i you know i know they're in (38:25 - 38:29)
the game i don't know what under what (38:27 - 38:31)
weather conditions they'll show up but (38:29 - 38:32)
here's a raid (38:31 - 38:35)
and i can just do it here so i'll just (38:32 - 38:36)
do it (38:35 - 38:38)
like i'm already checking them to get (38:36 - 38:40)
the watts so (38:38 - 38:43)
if it's one that i haven't had before (38:40 - 38:46)
i might as well just throw it up um (38:43 - 38:49)
like yesterday i ran into armaldo i ran (38:46 - 38:50)
into (38:49 - 38:53)
gmax gengar i ran into a sable eye that (38:50 - 38:55)
i thought i'd just do for shiny (38:53 - 38:56)
so there were things that i was like (38:55 - 38:58)
well i'm already here i might as well (38:56 - 38:59)
throw it up (38:58 - 39:01)
and it also appears in the y comb which (38:59 - 39:03)
dynamics adventures don't (39:01 - 39:06)
yeah oh that complaint one (39:03 - 39:09)
the the other thing is the catching you (39:06 - 39:11)
just wanna (39:09 - 39:13)
expand on that a bit so like if you're (39:11 - 39:15)
going through and you're shiny hunting (39:13 - 39:18)
landorus for example and you decide not (39:15 - 39:20)
to catch landorus (39:18 - 39:21)
obviously you have to go through the (39:20 - 39:23)
whole 20 minutes to get the shiny check (39:21 - 39:24)
again (39:23 - 39:26)
even though at the end we now know with (39:24 - 39:28)
the asterisks unless something changes (39:26 - 39:30)
from the data miner that it's a (39:28 - 39:32)
one in a hundred chance every time you (39:30 - 39:33)
encounter landorus (39:32 - 39:35)
for it to be shiny if you have the shiny (39:33 - 39:37)
charm if you have the shiny term thing (39:35 - 39:40)
not everybody does right if you catch (39:37 - 39:42)
the landorus (39:40 - 39:44)
then you will never get another landorus (39:42 - 39:45)
to (39:44 - 39:48)
catch you can still battle landorus's in (39:45 - 39:49)
the future (39:48 - 39:51)
you just will not have the option to (39:49 - 39:54)
catch them once you catch yours (39:51 - 39:56)
now this is i've never seen this before (39:54 - 39:57)
but i've gotten a lot of questions this (39:56 - 39:58)
weekend (39:57 - 40:00)
hey if i caught my suicune and i release (39:58 - 40:03)
it into the wild the suicune come back (40:00 - 40:06)
into my dynamics adventure no do not do (40:03 - 40:07)
that (40:06 - 40:11)
don't do that which is why i'm happy (40:07 - 40:12)
that i have a copy of both games so that (40:11 - 40:14)
when i meet kiram again (40:12 - 40:17)
i will not just keep it yeah (40:14 - 40:18)
i mean i kept my sweet goon but i (40:17 - 40:21)
already had a shiny suicune since (40:18 - 40:23)
that was the first one that i did and i (40:21 - 40:24)
wasn't sure if it was increased shiny (40:23 - 40:25)
odds or not (40:24 - 40:27)
so i just caught it to see what that (40:25 - 40:28)
experience was yeah i wonder if (40:27 - 40:30)
everybody gets sweet as their first (40:28 - 40:32)
i did not i got (40:30 - 40:35)
uh okay some didn't i i think it's i (40:32 - 40:35)
think it's (40:35 - 40:37)
as random as everything else but yeah (40:35 - 40:38)
suicune was my first and a few others (40:37 - 40:40)
but there was a lot of people's first (40:38 - 40:42)
did you i i wonder if suicune was your (40:40 - 40:43)
first because you did (40:42 - 40:47)
npc oh possibly oh yeah i did mine fully (40:43 - 40:47)
solo (40:47 - 40:49)
i did mine so i did my first one with a (40:47 - 40:51)
group and i got uh (40:49 - 40:55)
i got like evil tall or something um (40:51 - 40:57)
bacon last week i i was like i'm not (40:55 - 40:59)
gonna shiny hunt these because i'm not (40:57 - 41:00)
going i'm not going to (40:59 - 41:03)
do a one in four thousand for 20 minutes (41:00 - 41:04)
it is 20 minutes still (41:03 - 41:06)
it is 20 minutes but it's a one in a (41:04 - 41:07)
hundred chance uh which (41:06 - 41:09)
is fun it's one in a hundred and it's a (41:07 - 41:11)
good time yeah and it's a good (41:09 - 41:14)
like it's so much like doing these (41:11 - 41:15)
battles even though they're ray battles (41:14 - 41:16)
because you're forced in these (41:15 - 41:18)
situations to use pokemon you're not (41:16 - 41:21)
used to yeah because people forget (41:18 - 41:23)
i mean i've had we've we've lost like (41:21 - 41:25)
i've lost before i got to landers which (41:23 - 41:26)
is really frustrating you know you could (41:25 - 41:28)
be like oh it's one in 100 for (41:26 - 41:31)
landorus well let me try to at least get (41:28 - 41:32)
there because somebody picked a (41:31 - 41:34)
miraculous and the other three people (41:32 - 41:36)
picked water pokemon and now maractus is (41:34 - 41:37)
just sucking up every water movement we (41:36 - 41:39)
can't attack (41:37 - 41:43)
um so there's been really fun situations (41:39 - 41:44)
like that where it's like ah we failed (41:43 - 41:46)
this raid but at least we're having a (41:44 - 41:47)
good time so (41:46 - 41:50)
i'm still fun it's fun to fail still (41:47 - 41:52)
you know i mean it will probably not be (41:50 - 41:53)
fun to fail (41:52 - 41:57)
four months from now but it is still (41:53 - 41:59)
it's still fun now the other thing i (41:57 - 42:01)
didn't even think about is like i get to (41:59 - 42:01)
i get (42:01 - 42:04)
i like i got to a zapdos and i'm like i (42:01 - 42:05)
guess i can catch it (42:04 - 42:12)
but what i have i have 20 zapdos (42:05 - 42:12)
and i have four shiny zapdos and pokemon (42:12 - 42:16)
go i (42:15 - 42:18)
i should actually just like i don't need (42:16 - 42:19)
to be shiny i just think (42:18 - 42:22)
like yeah well that's an interesting (42:19 - 42:23)
like called you just (42:22 - 42:25)
the ones that you don't want shiny you (42:23 - 42:27)
just catch them and pull them out of (42:25 - 42:28)
your rotation (42:27 - 42:30)
i guess it pulls it out of your rotation (42:28 - 42:32)
right but you if you're joining other (42:30 - 42:33)
people (42:32 - 42:34)
it doesn't pull it out of there so (42:33 - 42:36)
that's like the weird thing i'm thinking (42:34 - 42:37)
of of like (42:36 - 42:39)
for me i guess i if i am going to shiny (42:37 - 42:41)
hunt i'm going to shiny hunt the few (42:39 - 42:42)
that i don't have like (42:41 - 42:45)
i have gosh because of pokemon go and (42:42 - 42:47)
because of let's go and because of (42:45 - 42:49)
sun and moon i have so many of these (42:47 - 42:51)
legends shiny like i have every shiny (42:49 - 42:53)
ultra beast except for (42:51 - 42:54)
buzzwall and cortana because i was too (42:53 - 42:56)
lazy to switch (42:54 - 42:59)
to the other version of the game yeah i (42:56 - 43:01)
i am all about shiny hunty (42:59 - 43:05)
shiny hunting ultra beasts yeah (43:01 - 43:08)
but it's like i have i have (43:05 - 43:12)
three four of the mole traces the zapdos (43:08 - 43:14)
the articunos from let's go and from (43:12 - 43:16)
pokemon go and it's like (43:14 - 43:18)
i have all of these shinies so there's (43:16 - 43:20)
only very few i don't have like i i (43:18 - 43:21)
don't have (43:20 - 43:23)
landorus i don't have thunderous and (43:21 - 43:25)
tornados and i don't have the (43:23 - 43:28)
lake spirits and that's kind of it (43:25 - 43:31)
and then i'm i'm thinking like what am i (43:28 - 43:33)
going to do for reggie drago and reggie (43:31 - 43:35)
cash register and i'm i'm probably just (43:33 - 43:37)
going to catch them because (43:35 - 43:40)
it to me it feels weird of having only (43:37 - 43:40)
one (43:40 - 43:42)
registered in my pokedex and that one (43:40 - 43:43)
being shiny so i guess i catch it and (43:42 - 43:45)
then if i do decide i want to shiny on (43:43 - 43:46)
it which (43:45 - 43:48)
by the way the the new reggies are not (43:46 - 43:49)
in dynamics adventure (43:48 - 43:50)
none of the reggies are indicted max (43:49 - 43:53)
adventure they have they're one of the (43:50 - 43:54)
four different story lines you can do (43:53 - 43:56)
one of them is kayla rex one of them is (43:54 - 43:57)
the reggie's (43:56 - 43:59)
one of them is the gallerian birds which (43:57 - 44:00)
is kind of confusing (43:59 - 44:03)
the gallerian birds are out in the world (44:00 - 44:05)
but the regular kintonian birds are in (44:03 - 44:06)
dynamics adventure (44:05 - 44:09)
yeah all the reggie's are out of (44:06 - 44:10)
dynamics adventure (44:09 - 44:13)
yeah so i if i'm going to decide to (44:10 - 44:14)
shiny hunt the reggie's (44:13 - 44:16)
i'll wait to a second copy because i do (44:14 - 44:18)
want a regular (44:16 - 44:20)
of the new reggie do we know if the (44:18 - 44:22)
hershey foods are actually in the (44:20 - 44:22)
dynamics (44:22 - 44:24)
they're not there's no hershey foods um (44:22 - 44:26)
there is uh (44:24 - 44:30)
there is type null and uh savalai (44:26 - 44:32)
the hershey foods cosmo cosmo these are (44:30 - 44:34)
legendary pokemon that do not appear in (44:32 - 44:37)
the dynamics adventure um lunala and (44:34 - 44:39)
solgaleo do their version exclusive (44:37 - 44:42)
i've heard uh zygarde is the biggest (44:39 - 44:43)
nightmare in the entire world i've heard (44:42 - 44:44)
that too (44:43 - 44:47)
because of power construct so very happy (44:44 - 44:49)
i'm sitting on three toothpaste zygardes (44:47 - 44:51)
from gamestop because (44:49 - 44:53)
that will be one pokemon i will catch (44:51 - 44:55)
right away i've heard just nightmares of (44:53 - 44:57)
people failing zygarde over and over (44:55 - 44:58)
again (44:57 - 44:59)
can i get my minor complaints out of the (44:58 - 45:02)
way yeah wait wait wait let one more (44:59 - 45:04)
okay before i promise this is super (45:02 - 45:05)
quick (45:04 - 45:08)
for the unova fans if you (45:05 - 45:11)
get your keurum and your zekrom and your (45:08 - 45:12)
restaurant and you're like (45:11 - 45:14)
i want to mix up the dna of these dudes (45:12 - 45:16)
where do i get my dna splicers (45:14 - 45:20)
you go up to stow inside the dude who (45:16 - 45:21)
sells you the cracked pots and the (45:20 - 45:22)
chipped pots (45:21 - 45:25)
he will hand you a dna splicer and a (45:22 - 45:26)
life do (45:25 - 45:30)
all right greg all yours okay one (45:26 - 45:32)
doesn't appear in why come and it's not (45:30 - 45:33)
very clear how to join (45:32 - 45:36)
somebody else's uh layer rates yeah (45:33 - 45:39)
can you explain okay i wanna i wanna (45:36 - 45:41)
join greg's raid how do i do it where do (45:39 - 45:42)
i go (45:41 - 45:45)
okay so first i will set a link code (45:42 - 45:49)
and then when through somehow some means (45:45 - 45:50)
outside of the game (45:49 - 45:52)
confirm that everybody is in front of (45:50 - 45:53)
the scientist (45:52 - 45:56)
in the layer ready to go (45:53 - 45:58)
then i will put in my code and say (45:56 - 46:00)
invite others (45:58 - 46:02)
then you the person that wants to join (46:00 - 46:05)
mine puts in the exact same code (46:02 - 46:08)
and then says invite others and what it (46:05 - 46:09)
does is (46:08 - 46:13)
everybody who has the same code ends up (46:09 - 46:16)
together which since humans are still (46:13 - 46:18)
bad at numbers means that sometimes (46:16 - 46:19)
multiple people since there's (46:18 - 46:22)
millions of playing have picked the same (46:19 - 46:23)
code as you (46:22 - 46:25)
no no no you always just start with zero (46:23 - 46:26)
because all the lazy people start with (46:25 - 46:28)
one because it's the first one you gotta (46:26 - 46:29)
work (46:28 - 46:31)
you gotta go down to zero you gotta put (46:29 - 46:32)
the person that started with seven (46:31 - 46:35)
multiple times and still had people jump (46:32 - 46:36)
into other people's raids (46:35 - 46:38)
there's a million people playing in a (46:36 - 46:40)
million combinations (46:38 - 46:42)
have never had a random join my raid (46:40 - 46:43)
well (46:42 - 46:45)
i always start i always started with (46:43 - 46:48)
zero i never started with one (46:45 - 46:49)
because zero is so far out of the way i (46:48 - 46:51)
have never started with one either (46:49 - 46:53)
i have started way down below just like (46:51 - 46:55)
you can't start with sevens people like (46:53 - 46:58)
seven lucky seven people (46:55 - 47:00)
people who are people who are now (46:58 - 47:01)
listening to this program are gonna (47:00 - 47:03)
start doing zeros because of you (47:01 - 47:06)
so stuff that let me tell you my second (47:03 - 47:08)
best number (47:06 - 47:11)
so so stuff it you're it's gonna happen (47:08 - 47:12)
because there's so many people playing (47:11 - 47:13)
the game right now (47:12 - 47:15)
so you have to put in the same code and (47:13 - 47:17)
hit invite others and then verify (47:15 - 47:20)
outside okay are you making all eight (47:17 - 47:21)
digits unique (47:20 - 47:24)
yes are you doing like seven zero zero (47:21 - 47:24)
seven (47:24 - 47:28)
seven zero zero my digits are unique (47:24 - 47:32)
and it happened don't don't even try (47:28 - 47:32)
that (47:32 - 47:34)
garbage with me steve i know what i'm (47:32 - 47:35)
talking about (47:34 - 47:39)
it is still are you doing 4 24 26 i'm (47:35 - 47:40)
doing six (47:39 - 47:41)
nine six nine four yeah that's your (47:40 - 47:44)
problem six nine six nine (47:41 - 47:46)
no i'm not doing that i'm doing unique (47:44 - 47:48)
numbers and it still happens (47:46 - 47:51)
like it just happens but that whole (47:48 - 47:52)
process of getting (47:51 - 47:55)
everybody to join in two minute or is it (47:52 - 47:56)
three minute (47:55 - 47:58)
somewhere in their window is a bit of a (47:56 - 47:59)
nightmare (47:58 - 48:01)
um especially since people's outside (47:59 - 48:02)
names if you'll say (48:01 - 48:04)
in slack and their in-game names don't (48:02 - 48:07)
match and you're like is this you (48:04 - 48:10)
or who are you so the fact that that (48:07 - 48:11)
process (48:10 - 48:13)
also isn't explained anywhere in the (48:11 - 48:14)
game it's just like (48:13 - 48:16)
i don't know is this how we do it and (48:14 - 48:18)
then eventually it works but (48:16 - 48:20)
you have to everybody has to put in the (48:18 - 48:22)
same code and hit invite others and you (48:20 - 48:24)
all should pop into the same raid (48:22 - 48:25)
together (48:24 - 48:27)
that process is a bit of a nightmare i (48:25 - 48:28)
am not a fan (48:27 - 48:31)
minor complaint two is since you don't (48:28 - 48:32)
know (48:31 - 48:35)
if it's going to be shiny at the end it (48:32 - 48:36)
makes your (48:35 - 48:40)
choice of pokeball through the gameplay (48:36 - 48:43)
more difficult because if you really (48:40 - 48:45)
want a shiny (48:43 - 48:48)
uh jigglypuff in a friend ball (48:45 - 48:50)
you can send that friend ball out and if (48:48 - 48:51)
that jiggly puff is shiny (48:50 - 48:54)
isn't shiny you've wasted that ball (48:51 - 48:56)
because you don't get the balls that you (48:54 - 48:56)
used (48:56 - 48:59)
on the other three pokemon back they are (48:56 - 49:00)
gone (48:59 - 49:04)
so you sort of have to decide is (49:00 - 49:06)
what balls am i going to use am i going (49:04 - 49:07)
to be happy having (49:06 - 49:11)
this shiny in this ball that i don't (49:07 - 49:12)
want it in (49:11 - 49:15)
or am i willing to constantly take the (49:12 - 49:17)
risk of (49:15 - 49:20)
i'm going to use my friend ball on this (49:17 - 49:23)
legendary and hope that it's shiny i've (49:20 - 49:25)
only got 10 shots at this (49:23 - 49:28)
the fact that those balls are wasted is (49:25 - 49:30)
a minor complaint it's a little bit (49:28 - 49:32)
frustrating because for people who (49:30 - 49:34)
really want to use (49:32 - 49:36)
the apricorn balls and those are already (49:34 - 49:37)
hard to get (49:36 - 49:41)
it's a hard it's a hard decision to make (49:37 - 49:43)
do i waste it not knowing if it's going (49:41 - 49:44)
to be shiny if you (49:43 - 49:46)
really want to shine an apricorn ball (49:44 - 49:48)
you have other ways to do it you do (49:46 - 49:49)
you absolutely do but it is like i said (49:48 - 49:51)
it's a minor complaint (49:49 - 49:53)
about about this that you that even in (49:51 - 49:56)
the raid itself you don't know (49:53 - 49:58)
until the entire thing is over and then (49:56 - 50:00)
it determines shiny (49:58 - 50:02)
and so i'm just throwing everything in (50:00 - 50:04)
luxury balls i have 999 of them and i (50:02 - 50:06)
like luxury balls so that's not a huge (50:04 - 50:07)
decision for me (50:06 - 50:11)
but for other people it is like well i (50:07 - 50:12)
really want wanted in this (50:11 - 50:15)
am i going to use this ball now (50:12 - 50:18)
on on the one in 100 chance that it's (50:15 - 50:20)
shiny and in the ball that i want (50:18 - 50:21)
yeah that's just the fact that you don't (50:20 - 50:24)
get those balls back (50:21 - 50:26)
after you've caught them because you can (50:24 - 50:27)
only pick one (50:26 - 50:30)
is my only is it it's again it's a minor (50:27 - 50:31)
complaint it's (50:30 - 50:33)
it's up there with the fact that i just (50:31 - 50:35)
really want a way to (50:33 - 50:38)
swap a ball in game i want to be able to (50:35 - 50:39)
put my star (50:38 - 50:40)
there's a game into the electric ball (50:39 - 50:42)
factory that they never took advantage (50:40 - 50:43)
right (50:42 - 50:44)
like that would just fix that problem (50:43 - 50:46)
like and that's just like those are my (50:44 - 50:47)
two minor complaints it's (50:46 - 50:50)
a little frustrating there's no there's (50:47 - 50:52)
no in-game way to communicate with other (50:50 - 50:53)
people (50:52 - 50:55)
so you do have to rely outside the game (50:53 - 50:57)
which i tend to not like (50:55 - 51:00)
and your ball choices are (50:57 - 51:02)
use it and lose it if you don't pick (51:00 - 51:03)
that pokemon (51:02 - 51:05)
because it is a guaranteed catch rate so (51:03 - 51:08)
it's very tempting to use these balls (51:05 - 51:09)
but you don't know if they're shining (51:08 - 51:12)
until the end so it can come across as (51:09 - 51:14)
i use this ball and you know i've just (51:12 - 51:16)
lost my last moon ball because it wasn't (51:14 - 51:17)
shiny (51:16 - 51:20)
so just know that going in that you (51:17 - 51:22)
if you use that ball to catch that (51:20 - 51:24)
pokemon and you don't take it (51:22 - 51:27)
you lose that pokeball no matter what it (51:24 - 51:28)
is it doesn't come back (51:27 - 51:30)
worst case scenario if you really wanted (51:28 - 51:32)
hidden ability (51:30 - 51:35)
cr brawlers not of the game if (51:32 - 51:39)
you hidden ability uh machoke (51:35 - 51:42)
and you used your moon ball worst case (51:39 - 51:43)
scenario is you can always take it to (51:42 - 51:46)
the daycare and breed the moon ball down (51:43 - 51:48)
yeah so it's not a complete waste but (51:46 - 51:49)
yeah i get what you're saying (51:48 - 51:52)
yeah but on legendaries you you know (51:49 - 51:54)
it's a use it lose it (51:52 - 51:56)
and hope that it's shiny because you (51:54 - 51:57)
don't get to see in (51:56 - 52:00)
the actual raids and yeah again like (51:57 - 52:02)
those are the two things that i'm like (52:00 - 52:03)
i think that's the i think that's the (52:02 - 52:05)
good trade-off that they've yeah they've (52:03 - 52:06)
done there they they've (52:05 - 52:09)
they've given you an increased shiny (52:06 - 52:10)
chance (52:09 - 52:12)
right and the trade-off is it's kind of (52:10 - 52:14)
like i think of it like (52:12 - 52:16)
like wormhole or like chain fishing i (52:14 - 52:17)
remember i'm sure this is going to (52:16 - 52:19)
happen once monday comes because the (52:17 - 52:20)
thing came out over a weekend but (52:19 - 52:22)
i'm sure you're going to see like oh my (52:20 - 52:24)
gosh shiny hunting's so (52:22 - 52:26)
broken and it made it so easy which is (52:24 - 52:28)
funny because like six months ago people (52:26 - 52:30)
were complaining that it was not (52:28 - 52:32)
hard it was too hard or not fair or (52:30 - 52:33)
whatever (52:32 - 52:35)
there's like a limit to that right so (52:33 - 52:36)
this is the same thing that happened (52:35 - 52:37)
with chain fishing people were like oh (52:36 - 52:40)
it's so broken it's easy shinies but (52:37 - 52:43)
there's only so many fish in x and y (52:40 - 52:45)
that you could have chain fished for (52:43 - 52:47)
right and then each route had like three (52:45 - 52:48)
different fish (52:47 - 52:49)
and then you were like wow cool i got (52:48 - 52:51)
all three fish it was really hard it was (52:49 - 52:53)
like sixty percent magikarp thirty (52:51 - 52:54)
percent (52:53 - 52:56)
bar boats ten percent goldie and i got (52:54 - 52:57)
that ten percent goldeen (52:56 - 52:59)
and you're like wow i love chain fishing (52:57 - 53:00)
and then you go to another route and (52:59 - 53:01)
you're like (53:00 - 53:02)
okay well this one also has magikarp but (53:01 - 53:05)
it has like sidra and quill fish (53:02 - 53:07)
and then you like get all those three (53:05 - 53:08)
and you might have gotten like a couple (53:07 - 53:10)
extra magikarp and then you go to (53:08 - 53:11)
another route and you're like (53:10 - 53:13)
all right well this one has golden and (53:11 - 53:15)
magikarp and cdra (53:13 - 53:17)
i like like you there's a there was a (53:15 - 53:18)
limit to that (53:17 - 53:21)
right and and there was a limit to (53:18 - 53:22)
wormholes (53:21 - 53:24)
and the same thing happened people were (53:22 - 53:26)
like oh wormhole is broken so easy shiny (53:24 - 53:27)
they're just handing them out like candy (53:26 - 53:28)
my grandma (53:27 - 53:30)
has 17 shinies because of it and she's (53:28 - 53:32)
only played 10 minutes (53:30 - 53:35)
but once you get like 15 of the 20 (53:32 - 53:36)
shinies it was (53:35 - 53:37)
really hard to get the last five because (53:36 - 53:40)
you had no control you could control the (53:37 - 53:42)
wormhole you went into but (53:40 - 53:44)
then it rolled between the five pokemon (53:42 - 53:45)
and it's like well (53:44 - 53:47)
i was missing ian mega in the red one (53:45 - 53:49)
and oh i got altaria (53:47 - 53:53)
not yamaga so it did get harder (53:49 - 53:55)
and i can't imagine i'm sure there are (53:53 - 53:56)
people that are like oh my gosh i'm (53:55 - 53:58)
gonna get shiny after shiny after shiny (53:56 - 54:00)
yeah maybe i mean it's 100 it's really (53:58 - 54:02)
really good uh for 20 minutes of your (54:00 - 54:03)
time (54:02 - 54:06)
but you don't like if if if you see a (54:03 - 54:07)
cramer ant (54:06 - 54:09)
and your group doesn't decide to go that (54:07 - 54:10)
route well now you just missed out the (54:09 - 54:11)
cramer ant (54:10 - 54:13)
and now you're fighting another rhyhorn (54:11 - 54:14)
or something (54:13 - 54:16)
um like there is no control like if you (54:14 - 54:18)
were thinking yeah i'm going to get (54:16 - 54:19)
shiny jigglypuff by doing dynamics (54:18 - 54:21)
adventure (54:19 - 54:22)
i i haven't even seen jigglypuff yet (54:21 - 54:24)
like i've seen exeggutor like three (54:22 - 54:25)
times (54:24 - 54:26)
if you were that person that (54:25 - 54:28)
specifically wants to shiny hunt a (54:26 - 54:31)
pro pokemon you're probably better off (54:28 - 54:32)
for (54:31 - 54:35)
your time to do that outside of dynamax (54:32 - 54:36)
adventure whether that is masuda or (54:35 - 54:38)
whether that's overworld encounter (54:36 - 54:39)
because you know (54:38 - 54:41)
at the end of that you're guaranteed (54:39 - 54:43)
that whether it takes ten minutes (54:41 - 54:45)
or two weeks i did eight hours of (54:43 - 54:48)
dynamics adventure and i saw executor (54:45 - 54:49)
three times i saw jigglypuff (54:48 - 54:53)
zero times so there that you're trading (54:49 - 54:53)
off (54:53 - 54:56)
control for luck i guess is is what the (54:53 - 54:59)
pokemon company has seem to be doing (54:56 - 55:02)
in in these one-off shiny methods that (54:59 - 55:03)
they keep for a game and not (55:02 - 55:06)
also let me interject um do not (55:03 - 55:09)
dynamics adventure for hidden ability (55:06 - 55:10)
pokemon (55:09 - 55:13)
the ability patch exists oh my gosh it's (55:10 - 55:13)
so (55:13 - 55:16)
expensive dynamics so expensive that's (55:13 - 55:17)
fine (55:16 - 55:19)
still if that is what like the one thing (55:17 - 55:21)
that you're looking for (55:19 - 55:24)
it's cheaper than a beast ball yeah no (55:21 - 55:27)
no no no no beast ball is 150. (55:24 - 55:30)
200. oh i guess i misread it i've done (55:27 - 55:32)
eight nine 10 hours of dynamics (55:30 - 55:35)
adventure i think i just hit 200 (55:32 - 55:38)
yeah it's a lot which is fine (55:35 - 55:40)
yeah it's i mean it's fine i i mean i'm (55:38 - 55:43)
sure in a future game it'll be (55:40 - 55:45)
what was it like bottle caps are really (55:43 - 55:46)
expensive right (55:45 - 55:48)
and then alpha sun and moon they got (55:46 - 55:50)
like a little cheaper and (55:48 - 55:51)
in this game you just find them on the (55:50 - 55:53)
ground right yeah (55:51 - 55:54)
people are just tossing them out there (55:53 - 55:56)
you go for you (55:54 - 55:58)
mints at the beginning of this game were (55:56 - 56:00)
were impossible (55:58 - 56:02)
and now there's like islands that just (56:00 - 56:03)
generate them every day (56:02 - 56:05)
and they appear randomly throughout (56:03 - 56:07)
crown tundra too yeah i've read across (56:05 - 56:07)
them like oh (56:07 - 56:09)
what okay and i'm sure if there's (56:07 - 56:10)
another pokemon game they'll take it all (56:09 - 56:12)
away from us again (56:10 - 56:14)
of course but did you just say if (56:12 - 56:15)
there's another pokemon game (56:14 - 56:18)
you know if the small indie company can (56:15 - 56:19)
you know (56:18 - 56:22)
survive scrape up enough dollars to put (56:19 - 56:24)

about this (59:36 - 59:39)
why are they complaining about it (59:39 - 59:42)

and there will be surprises for the (61:33 - 61:37)
snapshot (61:36 - 61:40)
and that's it it sounds like fun i wish (61:37 - 61:42)
it was here too because i like all the (61:40 - 61:44)
pokemon that are showing up (61:42 - 61:47)
but it's cool yeah i wonder if they'll (61:44 - 61:48)
do more (61:47 - 61:50)
specific events i'm assuming this is (61:48 - 61:51)
kind of the start right (61:50 - 61:55)
there are probably plenty of things that (61:51 - 61:58)
americans don't celebrate that others do (61:55 - 62:00)
i am a little confused so is this for (61:58 - 62:02)
all of south america though (62:00 - 62:05)
it doesn't specifically say mexico and (62:02 - 62:07)
other parts of the america celebrate it (62:05 - 62:09)
but then it depends on what they define (62:07 - 62:10)
as latin america (62:09 - 62:14)
yeah yeah and like as far as i'm aware (62:10 - 62:16)
like day of the dead is like a mexican (62:14 - 62:17)
tradition (62:16 - 62:19)
it is not a brazilian it's not an (62:17 - 62:21)
argentinian it's like a mexican (62:19 - 62:22)
tradition (62:21 - 62:25)
so that's where i was like (62:22 - 62:27)
why why would they have it in these (62:25 - 62:29)
other places yeah it depends on what (62:27 - 62:30)
they consider (62:29 - 62:33)
like what their latin american region is (62:30 - 62:35)
i don't know (62:33 - 62:38)
how how far that extends or where they (62:35 - 62:40)
also say that latin america is supposed (62:38 - 62:42)
to get corsola and it's still appearing (62:40 - 62:42)
in (62:42 - 62:45)
texas and florida (62:42 - 62:45)
i don't know how they like limit it yeah (62:45 - 62:50)
i don't know (62:48 - 62:52)
does it is it based off your profile you (62:50 - 62:54)
set is it based off of (62:52 - 62:57)
your location i don't know how they roll (62:54 - 62:59)
this out (62:57 - 63:00)
it's cool though it sounds cool sounds (62:59 - 63:02)

tokyo kiss is really good in go battle (63:27 - 63:31)
badly that's probably why (63:29 - 63:35)

remember when legendaries were in (63:35 - 63:38)
breakthrough encounters yeah that was (63:36 - 63:38)

uh we'll be in five star raids they all (65:15 - 65:19)
end in the end that's how you remember (65:18 - 65:21)
though tarakian (65:19 - 65:24)
kobelian i didn't believe it was verizon (65:21 - 65:27)
but it is verizon like verizon wireless (65:24 - 65:29)
verizon (65:27 - 65:33)
it's just weird that (65:29 - 65:35)
they didn't keep they didn't make him (65:33 - 65:36)
ion (65:35 - 65:39)

lion ion i mean we do not know what the (65:41 - 65:47)
raid boss will be (65:45 - 65:49)
for november 24th through the 30th but (65:47 - 65:51)
that will be a (65:49 - 65:52)
set period of time where a raid boss (65:51 - 65:55)
will appear (65:52 - 65:55)
spotlight hours uh on tuesday november (65:55 - 65:59)
3rd (65:58 - 66:01)

november 10th jigglypuff will appear (66:03 - 66:06)
double the xp (66:05 - 66:09)
november 17th meowth will appear because (66:06 - 66:10)
we haven't gotten enough meowth in the (66:09 - 66:11)
last like (66:10 - 66:14)
year meowth will appear twice the candy (66:11 - 66:16)
again (66:14 - 66:19)
i guess on november 24th everyone's (66:16 - 66:19)
favorite (66:19 - 66:22)
bar boats will appear with twice the (66:19 - 66:24)
candy for transferring (66:22 - 66:27)
save your transfers for that i guess i (66:24 - 66:28)
mean i am (66:27 - 66:31)
so i'm at the very limit for storage (66:28 - 66:32)
because i keep waiting (66:31 - 66:35)
for this go integration mm-hmm end of (66:32 - 66:36)
the year (66:35 - 66:39)
uh they need to hurry because december (66:36 - 66:41)
31st is what (66:39 - 66:44)
i know wasn't that when pokemon bank (66:41 - 66:45)
came out it came out like the 30th of (66:44 - 66:47)
december (66:45 - 66:49)
well it came out yeah i felt like it (66:47 - 66:51)
came out real late (66:49 - 66:55)
other thing to take note here is that (66:51 - 66:58)
uh they did an egg rotation so all the (66:55 - 66:59)
eggs are (66:58 - 67:01)
different except for the 12ks obviously (66:59 - 67:02)
those just rolled out so (67:01 - 67:04)
they have no reason to change it we (67:02 - 67:06)
don't have to go through the entire egg (67:04 - 67:08)
rotation rotation here (67:06 - 67:11)
but if you want to see what's in eggs i (67:08 - 67:12)
made a graphic that's on (67:11 - 67:16)
the twitter twitter.com pkmencast and on (67:12 - 67:17)
instagram (67:16 - 67:20)
uh pkmencast there are two of everything (67:17 - 67:23)
currently in the new egg rotations so if (67:20 - 67:24)
you're (67:23 - 67:26)
curious of if if you're looking for a (67:24 - 67:27)
specific pokemon (67:26 - 67:30)
and you're curious of where they are (67:27 - 67:31)
that'll help you (67:30 - 67:33)
i hope uh last thing here with pokemon (67:31 - 67:35)
go before we move on (67:33 - 67:38)
is that uh in celebration of the crown (67:35 - 67:39)
tundra (67:38 - 67:42)
ponyta and surface were in pokemon go (67:39 - 67:45)
for a good 24 hours that was a real fast (67:42 - 67:46)
event (67:45 - 67:49)
yep they made gallerian firefetch spawn (67:46 - 67:49)
everywhere (67:49 - 67:51)
there's now a way to evolve it into (67:49 - 67:53)
surfetch you have to set (67:51 - 67:56)
farfetch as your butty and then as (67:53 - 67:57)
farfetch is your buddy you have to get (67:56 - 67:58)
10 (67:57 - 68:01)
excellent throws not in a row just 10 (67:58 - 68:02)
excellent throws and then you will have (68:01 - 68:04)
the option to evolve which is actually (68:02 - 68:07)
really a cool way to do it and i kind of (68:04 - 68:10)
hope they do more of that in the future (68:07 - 68:11)
so when was that event (68:10 - 68:13)
that was the day the crown thunder came (68:11 - 68:15)
out yep so i'm glad that i got the news (68:13 - 68:17)
alert in pokemon go (68:15 - 68:20)
informing me of that event this morning (68:17 - 68:22)
they're either too early or too late you (68:20 - 68:24)
can't win the other thing is they added (68:22 - 68:26)
gallerian ponyta during this event in (68:24 - 68:28)
raids (68:26 - 68:30)
um and now that the event is over they (68:28 - 68:32)
put both gallery and ponyta (68:30 - 68:35)
and farfetch into 7k eggs so you can (68:32 - 68:36)
still get them (68:35 - 68:40)
if you like to hatch 7k eggs (68:36 - 68:44)
which everyone i don't us (68:40 - 68:47)
and uh the pokemon masters uh crown (68:44 - 68:48)
tundra event was (68:47 - 68:53)
uh nothing there was one no (68:48 - 68:55)
they did something interesting i don't i (68:53 - 68:56)
don't i (68:55 - 68:58)
understand what happened here uh like (68:56 - 69:00)
it's no surprise at this point that (68:58 - 69:03)
they've been doing pokemon go events to (69:00 - 69:04)
correspond with the (69:03 - 69:08)
anime or the core games or whatever (69:04 - 69:11)
pokemon masters did a pile of armor (69:08 - 69:14)
thing they acknowledged it (69:11 - 69:15)
they said i love armors here in the game (69:14 - 69:17)
they just didn't do it to be fair (69:15 - 69:18)
they're in the middle of their halloween (69:17 - 69:21)
event so they may not have wanted to (69:18 - 69:23)
because pokemon masters has never (69:21 - 69:24)
overlapped 18 of them oh (69:23 - 69:28)
i know i'm look i'm just trying to be (69:24 - 69:29)
nice (69:28 - 69:32)
for once in my life i mean there's (69:29 - 69:32)
already (69:32 - 69:35)
we don't have to we don't have time to (69:32 - 69:36)
talk about their (69:35 - 69:38)
the overall fan base with masters has (69:36 - 69:39)
been pretty unhappy since the (69:38 - 69:41)
anniversary event has ended (69:39 - 69:43)
and now the fact that they missed the (69:41 - 69:45)
release they didn't do anything for this (69:43 - 69:46)
release (69:45 - 69:48)
not even just acknowledge it seems (69:46 - 69:50)
worrisome in my opinion (69:48 - 69:53)
why well they acknowledge why because (69:50 - 69:54)
because at one point i would are (69:53 - 69:58)
because at one point i would say that (69:54 - 70:02)
it was very cool when it was pokemon day (69:58 - 70:04)
the pokemon company sent out an email (70:02 - 70:05)
they acknowledged (70:04 - 70:10)
pokemon go sword and shield and masters (70:05 - 70:12)
pokemon duel never got that treatment (70:10 - 70:14)
cafe mix i don't think was around at the (70:12 - 70:14)
time (70:14 - 70:18)
um you know other things in the pokemon (70:14 - 70:19)
franchise have never gotten that (70:18 - 70:20)
treatment the only thing (70:19 - 70:23)
outside of the main series games that (70:20 - 70:24)
god acknowledged was (70:23 - 70:26)
pokemon go because of how big it is but (70:24 - 70:28)
for masters to be on that like pedestal (70:26 - 70:29)
of like (70:28 - 70:31)
oh cool they're acknowledging masters (70:29 - 70:33)
masters is doing something for the (70:31 - 70:35)
what when is the pokemon's birthday 24th (70:33 - 70:37)
of february (70:35 - 70:40)
27th of february it was cool (70:37 - 70:43)
and then crown tundra came out or sorry (70:40 - 70:44)
isle of armor came out and masters (70:43 - 70:46)
acknowledged that that was really cool (70:44 - 70:47)
because again symmetry (70:46 - 70:50)
every they're all all their pillars are (70:47 - 70:51)
doing the same thing they're all (70:50 - 70:53)
acknowledging these big events together (70:51 - 70:55)
and now crown tundra is here pokemon go (70:53 - 70:57)
acknowledged it (70:55 - 70:59)
but masters did not so i mean what's (70:57 - 71:00)
your worry though like (70:59 - 71:04)
that masters is my worry is just that (71:00 - 71:07)
that i that i don't know like i don't i (71:04 - 71:09)
don't know what is happening there but i (71:07 - 71:12)
i do know that people are people are not (71:09 - 71:14)
happy with masters right now (71:12 - 71:16)
and they skip this event and we don't (71:14 - 71:18)
know what's planned for our uh november (71:16 - 71:19)
for masters (71:18 - 71:23)
so they've made something (71:19 - 71:23)
they may do something crown tundra after (71:24 - 71:27)
halloween (71:26 - 71:29)
yeah just give them some space give them (71:27 - 71:31)
some breathing room (71:29 - 71:34)
i mean they may so i feel like if you're (71:31 - 71:36)
coming off a one-year anniversary event (71:34 - 71:38)
you you you don't you don't lose all (71:36 - 71:40)
that momentum you gotta (71:38 - 71:41)
keep that momentum going right because (71:40 - 71:43)
players came back because of the one (71:41 - 71:45)
year anniversary (71:43 - 71:46)
yeah i mean but i don't think they've (71:45 - 71:48)
lost the momentum i think they've had (71:46 - 71:50)
very specific events (71:48 - 71:53)
for their game like they are in the (71:50 - 71:54)
middle of a big halloween (71:53 - 71:57)
event they may have like i i don't know (71:54 - 71:59)
what they would do (71:57 - 72:01)
for crown tundra that couldn't wait (71:59 - 72:02)
until november (72:01 - 72:04)
and and maybe they learned that players (72:02 - 72:06)
actually don't like (72:04 - 72:08)
overlapping events so i would say most (72:06 - 72:10)
players are (72:08 - 72:11)
saying that there's nothing to do with (72:10 - 72:13)
masters right now (72:11 - 72:15)
that's not good log in every day for (72:13 - 72:17)
free gems (72:15 - 72:19)
okay how many free gems are we actually (72:17 - 72:20)
like that used to be a thing (72:19 - 72:22)
uh now it's login for skip tickets that (72:20 - 72:24)
you can't really use (72:22 - 72:26)
yeah i mean i think that i think what's (72:24 - 72:27)
driving people (72:26 - 72:30)
away from masters isn't that there isn't (72:27 - 72:31)
new content (72:30 - 72:35)
it's that they had a really good (72:31 - 72:38)
thing going with the stamina that felt (72:35 - 72:40)
like it wasn't (72:38 - 72:43)
overpowering but also gave you things to (72:40 - 72:44)
do (72:43 - 72:46)
and now some of us are sitting on twelve (72:44 - 72:48)
hundred skip tickets (72:46 - 72:51)
and you can get and you get one 200 (72:48 - 72:55)
stamina update a day (72:51 - 72:57)
which which is 10 skip tickets which is (72:55 - 72:59)
10 skip tickets (72:57 - 73:02)
it's just not enough and the events are (72:59 - 73:03)
good (73:02 - 73:06)
but since they raised the cap to 125 (73:03 - 73:10)
and they raised the 6ex problem (73:06 - 73:13)
um some of those trick-or-treat boss (73:10 - 73:14)
battles (73:13 - 73:17)
are not fun if you haven't spent all of (73:14 - 73:18)
your time (73:17 - 73:21)
trying to get them up to 125. like they (73:18 - 73:23)
can be a very frustrating set of (73:21 - 73:25)
circumstances (73:23 - 73:27)
uh especially if you've been unlucky in (73:25 - 73:28)
polls (73:27 - 73:30)
i think there's just sort of a (73:28 - 73:32)
combination of the getcha (73:30 - 73:35)
thing the stamina being unbalanced (73:32 - 73:39)
that the current events in the game (73:35 - 73:42)
aren't aren't enough for you to spend (73:39 - 73:44)
out all of your stamina knowing that you (73:42 - 73:46)
won't get it back fast enough (73:44 - 73:49)
i i i don't think that's a hint that (73:46 - 73:51)
they've lost faith in the game i think (73:49 - 73:53)
that's a no i don't i don't think that (73:51 - 73:53)
like (73:53 - 73:55)
i don't think that masters is folding (73:53 - 73:57)
next week or anything (73:55 - 73:59)
but i do understand like deadlines right (73:57 - 74:00)
like if they're if they're in some sort (73:59 - 74:02)
of transitional period where they're (74:00 - 74:03)
trying to (74:02 - 74:07)
gear they're trying to shift gears into (74:03 - 74:09)
hey we want to make the game better hey (74:07 - 74:11)
we've been really silent for a while and (74:09 - 74:12)
they have been pretty (74:11 - 74:16)
silent um with communication (74:12 - 74:18)
that we're working on all this thing all (74:16 - 74:19)
these things because we know fans are (74:18 - 74:22)
not a hundred percent happy and because (74:19 - 74:24)
of that we just haven't had time and we (74:22 - 74:25)
missed the boat on (74:24 - 74:28)
approving everything to coincide with (74:25 - 74:30)
crown tundra i can totally see that (74:28 - 74:32)
happening that's probably maybe what did (74:30 - 74:33)
happen is like (74:32 - 74:35)
they're trying to make sure that they're (74:33 - 74:36)
launching (74:35 - 74:38)
my fingers across that they're launching (74:36 - 74:40)
something to alleviate a lot of the (74:38 - 74:42)
problems that people are expressing (74:40 - 74:44)
so going into november december people (74:42 - 74:46)
are are (74:44 - 74:49)
positive about masters again yeah (74:46 - 74:51)
uh there's no shortage of gotcha games (74:49 - 74:52)
that people seem to love i'm looking at (74:51 - 74:53)
you (74:52 - 74:56)
gentian impact gadget impact (74:53 - 74:59)
i have avoided because (74:56 - 75:02)
every every aspect and everybody who's (74:59 - 75:04)
played it says that it eats their life (75:02 - 75:06)
and i'm like look i got final fantasy 14 (75:04 - 75:08)
which has an incredible patch out right (75:06 - 75:10)
now and crown tundra (75:08 - 75:12)
which is also an incredible patch right (75:10 - 75:15)
now i do not need to add this game to my (75:12 - 75:16)
life (75:15 - 75:18)
plus i started playing among us there (75:16 - 75:19)
are things (75:18 - 75:23)
happening i am swamped (75:19 - 75:26)
plus you know job uh and i have a job (75:23 - 75:29)
whoa you guys have jobs yeah (75:26 - 75:31)
it's nice we get money you should try it (75:29 - 75:34)
what is money (75:31 - 75:34)
yeah i hope next time we uh podcast or (75:36 - 75:39)
something there's (75:38 - 75:41)

same day that crown tundra came out (76:20 - 76:23)

like targeting walmart and stuff uh but (77:06 - 77:10)
champions path has been so hard to find (77:08 - 77:13)
that good luck if you find it probably (77:10 - 77:14)

what is wrong with you get out of my (79:32 - 79:37)
life we know this (79:34 - 79:40)
about me how are we friends greg (79:37 - 79:44)
because i tolerate your presence but (79:40 - 79:44)
this save alive thing is making me (79:44 - 79:49)
rethink my entire hoodie stance (79:46 - 79:52)
because i love it very much (79:49 - 79:53)
hoodies are nice around the house it's a (79:52 - 79:55)
little chilly throw on a hoodie (79:53 - 79:58)
i hate having the thing hanging off the (79:55 - 80:00)
back of my neck and when i sit down (79:58 - 80:02)
i have something between me and the (80:00 - 80:03)
chair that's not (80:02 - 80:05)
all the way on my back it's halfway down (80:03 - 80:06)
my back are you doing (80:05 - 80:11)
this annoying sit different (80:06 - 80:14)
you uh you understand that i'm a gay man (80:11 - 80:15)
and we do not (80:14 - 80:18)
sit in chairs right as a rule you know (80:15 - 80:19)
this don't (80:18 - 80:22)
stereotype it is not a stereotype when (80:19 - 80:23)
everybody does it (80:22 - 80:26)
the problem is that (80:23 - 80:28)
i know i'm a pass on these hoodies i (80:26 - 80:31)
don't need extra attachments ears tails (80:28 - 80:32)
etc (80:31 - 80:35)
none not yet (80:32 - 80:35)
well when the event happens where i do (80:36 - 80:42)

know (80:42 - 80:47)

hold up (81:06 - 81:11)
now pass uh thanks to brandon for (81:08 - 81:13)
sending in the ball guys stuff (81:11 - 81:16)
from our slack community by the way just (81:13 - 81:17)
trying to give credit (81:16 - 81:20)
did you did you get the email where (81:17 - 81:23)
they had the animated dancing ball guy i (81:20 - 81:24)
probably got that evil (81:23 - 81:27)
well it was horrifying (81:24 - 81:30)
little long week with the uh with the (81:27 - 81:31)
the dlc (81:30 - 81:34)
dropping and twitch changing their rules (81:31 - 81:35)
and me panicking and (81:34 - 81:38)
it's been a heck of a week pokemon home (81:35 - 81:39)
got updated (81:38 - 81:41)
should we talk about this is there much (81:39 - 81:42)
to talk about (81:41 - 81:45)
no i mean everything got updated (81:42 - 81:47)
everything got updated to take crown (81:45 - 81:49)
tundra stuff yeah (81:47 - 81:52)
was there anything more special than (81:49 - 81:55)
that no i don't think so they added a (81:52 - 81:56)
small thing (81:55 - 81:59)
to home i mean at this point it's still (81:56 - 82:02)
hard to recommend home to somebody who (81:59 - 82:05)
yeah what small thing did they add okay (82:02 - 82:07)
uh so they added compatibility with the (82:05 - 82:08)
crown tundra (82:07 - 82:10)
part two of the sword and shields (82:08 - 82:12)
expansion pass (82:10 - 82:15)
they added a save feature for search and (82:12 - 82:17)
sorting settings in the pokemon boxes (82:15 - 82:21)
that was big well not big but something (82:17 - 82:21)
they added a new category for popular (82:23 - 82:26)
pokemon (82:26 - 82:29)
to the trade ranking so that's where you (82:26 - 82:31)
can search of like what's being (82:29 - 82:32)
requested the most what's not (82:31 - 82:35)
and they uh fix some other issues to (82:32 - 82:37)
ensure a user-friendly experience i (82:35 - 82:37)
don't (82:37 - 82:39)
know that i don't know what that means (82:37 - 82:41)
but we're at version 1.3 now (82:39 - 82:44)
still can i guess confidently say that (82:41 - 82:46)
home has been updated more than bank has (82:44 - 82:49)
in the first year that bank was in seven (82:46 - 82:50)
years (82:49 - 82:53)
so i has that going for it um there is (82:50 - 82:53)
still (82:53 - 82:56)
no transferring to pokemon go yet and we (82:53 - 82:56)
still (82:56 - 82:58)
don't know what that i mean i don't (82:56 - 83:00)
think from from pokemon (82:58 - 83:02)
go i don't know if any of us expected (83:00 - 83:03)
that this weekend (83:02 - 83:05)
no but it would be nice already enough (83:03 - 83:06)
to do (83:05 - 83:09)
what i have learned this past week is (83:06 - 83:10)
that (83:09 - 83:13)
i could easily spot any american in my (83:10 - 83:15)
twitch chat (83:13 - 83:17)
because they don't know how time zones (83:15 - 83:19)
work and they don't know that there are (83:17 - 83:20)
other countries (83:19 - 83:24)
in other time zones of all weekend being (83:20 - 83:24)
like (83:24 - 83:28)
when is the dlc when is the dlc oh (83:24 - 83:31)
that that's like uh yeah in in (83:28 - 83:34)
in my twitter (83:31 - 83:34)
and they were like when is the deals i (83:34 - 83:38)
thought the dlc was coming out on (83:37 - 83:39)
thursday i said (83:38 - 83:43)
yeah 9 p.m pacific and they said (83:39 - 83:46)
well that's friday and i'm like what how (83:43 - 83:48)
east coast centric art because it's (83:46 - 83:50)
midnight on the east coast (83:48 - 83:52)
yeah but the rest of the country is (83:50 - 83:54)
still in thursday buddy (83:52 - 83:56)
well yeah so this was the thing i i had (83:54 - 83:58)
to continue to point out to people so in (83:56 - 83:58)
the (83:58 - 84:00)
on the japanese pokemon website and on (83:58 - 84:02)
the in the japanese youtube video (84:00 - 84:04)
that announced the crown tundra it said (84:02 - 84:06)
friday the 23rd (84:04 - 84:10)
and then on the english youtube (84:06 - 84:12)
and on the english pokemon website it (84:10 - 84:13)
said the (84:12 - 84:17)
thursday the 22nd most people (84:13 - 84:19)
i i i'll give our podcast listeners (84:17 - 84:21)
credit because most of them are adults (84:19 - 84:24)
that can probably function in this world (84:21 - 84:26)
unlike twitch chat which is out of (84:24 - 84:27)
control um (84:26 - 84:29)
but we understand that japan is in the (84:27 - 84:31)
future right they're like 12 hours ahead (84:29 - 84:33)
of us (84:31 - 84:33)
so yes they are in the future the future (84:34 - 84:37)
is also (84:37 - 84:40)
now yes i can call the future right now (84:37 - 84:42)
i can call them and say what's tomorrow (84:40 - 84:42)
like (84:42 - 84:44)
please tell me so we're recording this (84:42 - 84:46)
podcast at 3 p.m on sunday (84:44 - 84:49)
it is technically monday in japan right (84:46 - 84:51)
now as we're recording this (84:49 - 84:53)
so this makes sense now i'm going to (84:51 - 84:54)
make this a little complicated (84:53 - 84:56)
that makes sense i'm going to make i'm (84:54 - 84:58)
going to make this a little complicated (84:56 - 85:00)
there was a third trailer (84:58 - 85:03)
for europe the uk trailer and the (85:00 - 85:06)
europe trailer said that (85:03 - 85:09)
it comes out on friday the 23rd (85:06 - 85:12)
so we have the uk uh or (85:09 - 85:16)
europe and japan saying friday and the (85:12 - 85:16)
us (85:16 - 85:20)
sang the 22nd so no the pokemon company (85:16 - 85:23)
game freak niantic whoever you want to (85:20 - 85:25)
blame did not lie (85:23 - 85:29)
to you i had plenty of that of like (85:25 - 85:30)
they lied to us they said it was going (85:29 - 85:32)
to come out on thursday it is still (85:30 - 85:35)
thursday buddy it is 8 p.m thursday (85:32 - 85:37)
we're still in thursday (85:35 - 85:38)
but anyways if we take the time zones (85:37 - 85:41)
from the uk (85:38 - 85:43)
and japan and we crossed that over with (85:41 - 85:45)
the us time zones there was like a six (85:43 - 85:47)
hour window where the game could have (85:45 - 85:49)
came out which was anywhere between (85:47 - 85:52)
6 p.m central time and (85:49 - 85:56)
and midnight central time which is (85:52 - 85:59)
4 to 10 pacific (85:56 - 86:03)
and 7 to 1 a.m eastern (85:59 - 86:06)
so that was the window that everything (86:03 - 86:07)
kind of overlapped (86:06 - 86:09)
and i think the dlc dropped around 8pm (86:07 - 86:11)
which was the same time (86:09 - 86:14)
ponyta and farfetch dropped in pokemon (86:11 - 86:14)
go (86:14 - 86:17)
and home went down for maintenance and (86:14 - 86:18)
everything so (86:17 - 86:20)
it did come out on thursday it was no (86:18 - 86:21)
lying i (86:20 - 86:23)
there's like this gamer mentality where (86:21 - 86:25)
like oh most games come out midnight so (86:23 - 86:26)
gamefreak lied to me because it didn't (86:25 - 86:28)
come out at midnight i want to remind (86:26 - 86:29)
you that the (86:28 - 86:31)
isle of armor came out at like 10 a.m or (86:29 - 86:33)
something like that (86:31 - 86:36)
uh so no game freak did not lie it did (86:33 - 86:37)
come out on thursday in america (86:36 - 86:39)
it came out on friday in the uk came out (86:37 - 86:41)
friday of japan (86:39 - 86:43)
all at the same time worldwide release (86:41 - 86:45)
it was just funny because (86:43 - 86:47)
i could tell that the person complaining (86:45 - 86:49)
that game free glide or it's not out yet (86:47 - 86:50)
was (86:49 - 86:53)
definitely american but did anybody (86:50 - 86:55)
tell japan about time you know that's a (86:53 - 86:57)
good question i still (86:55 - 86:59)
don't i guess the reason they probably (86:57 - 87:01)
didn't solidify the time (86:59 - 87:04)
this is my only maybe justification is (87:01 - 87:05)
because they didn't (87:04 - 87:07)
they had to line it up with pokemon go (87:05 - 87:09)
and so if pokemon go wasn't ready (87:07 - 87:11)
and they released it because they have (87:09 - 87:14)
they wanted ponyta and (87:11 - 87:16)
surface to come out and it all came out (87:14 - 87:17)
at the same time so (87:16 - 87:19)
but i don't get nintendo this is not a (87:17 - 87:21)
game freak or pokemon company this is a (87:19 - 87:22)
nintendo thing (87:21 - 87:25)
nintendo is also this company that (87:22 - 87:27)
doesn't tell you when the smash update (87:25 - 87:28)
is coming out i think smash players just (87:27 - 87:30)
expect it at like 8 pm (87:28 - 87:32)
central time at this point but how many (87:30 - 87:34)
updates have smash brothers have (87:32 - 87:38)
gotten seven eight yeah (87:34 - 87:39)
and yeah all of these updates they have (87:38 - 87:41)
never given a time (87:39 - 87:43)
when it comes out so it keeps it (87:41 - 87:45)
exciting mm-hmm (87:43 - 87:47)
is that is that what we're taking for (87:45 - 87:49)
excitement apple used to do the same (87:47 - 87:50)
thing dude (87:49 - 87:52)
yeah that's true but now apple will tell (87:50 - 87:53)
you when you can pre-order (87:52 - 87:56)
when it will ship you know what they (87:53 - 87:57)
used to do this is (87:56 - 87:59)
it funny how my co-workers are just like (87:57 - 88:01)
your twitch stream where apple tells you (87:59 - 88:02)
when you can pre-order and when it's (88:01 - 88:04)
actually available (88:02 - 88:05)
and the day of the apple announcements (88:04 - 88:07)
they're calling you up and saying please (88:05 - 88:08)
order me this phone (88:07 - 88:10)
i'm like it doesn't literally doesn't (88:08 - 88:13)
exist not a thing yet (88:10 - 88:15)
oh believe me as a person who has to (88:13 - 88:17)
deal with it we are well aware of those (88:15 - 88:17)
dates (88:17 - 88:19)
well that was all the news i have uh (88:17 - 88:20)
going back to crown (88:19 - 88:23)
tundra just a little bit more before we (88:20 - 88:24)
wrap up the show here (88:23 - 88:27)
i'm assuming neither of you guys did the (88:24 - 88:27)
star (88:27 - 88:30)
tournament the updated nah i haven't (88:27 - 88:31)
gotten that (88:30 - 88:34)
yet i i heard that the first i i haven't (88:31 - 88:36)
done it yet either because i've been (88:34 - 88:37)
stuck in raids (88:36 - 88:39)
um i've heard the first time it's pretty (88:37 - 88:40)
easy but once you beat it it increases (88:39 - 88:43)
the difficulty um but there is still no (88:40 - 88:44)
level scaling (88:43 - 88:46)
uh and i think what game had level was (88:44 - 88:47)
that emerald (88:46 - 88:49)
where like no matter what you brought in (88:47 - 88:50)
it scaled yeah (88:49 - 88:52)
um so people ratio is emerald people (88:50 - 88:54)
were a little bummed out that i heard (88:52 - 88:57)
the dialogue for the um star stuff is (88:54 - 88:57)
good so (88:57 - 88:59)
next week we can talk a little bit more (88:57 - 89:01)
i mean that's that's at the rose stadium (88:59 - 89:03)
right yeah it's at the rose stadium (89:01 - 89:07)
look that's old galler i'm in new galler (89:03 - 89:09)
all galleries dead to me i mean i do (89:07 - 89:11)
like that they're (89:09 - 89:13)
like applying the update to old galler (89:11 - 89:14)
like when i (89:13 - 89:17)
did my daily still on side task and the (89:14 - 89:19)
dude's like here's a dna splicer i was (89:17 - 89:21)
like oh how charming and sweet i (89:19 - 89:25)
think he was not expecting this (89:21 - 89:27)
is that the guy that says i guess all (89:25 - 89:28)
the time yes (89:27 - 89:30)
come back tomorrow if you might have (89:28 - 89:32)
something you want i guess (89:30 - 89:34)
can they program in a little bit of (89:32 - 89:35)
enthusiasm (89:34 - 89:39)
in the in the next patch there there is (89:35 - 89:41)
we talked about this last week where we (89:39 - 89:42)
were hoping that there was going to be (89:41 - 89:44)
some surprise (89:42 - 89:47)
of uh you know well it depends on what (89:44 - 89:49)
you want as a surprise (89:47 - 89:51)
right for me having a dude in the in the (89:49 - 89:53)
rose tower (89:51 - 89:55)
letting me use a a pokemon i caught in (89:53 - 89:56)
black and white (89:55 - 89:58)
in competitive ranked was a huge (89:56 - 90:00)
surprise that they didn't talk about (89:58 - 90:02)
there is a surprise in this game but (90:00 - 90:04)
it's way too spoilery for (90:02 - 90:05)
us to talk about this episode so we'll (90:04 - 90:07)
save it for next episode but (90:05 - 90:10)
um uh it has to do with the main calarex (90:07 - 90:10)
storyline (90:10 - 90:14)
so yeah i think that was (90:10 - 90:16)
yep i think it was a good surprise (90:14 - 90:18)
obviously is it gonna make me happy or (90:16 - 90:19)
sad (90:18 - 90:23)
yes okay yes (90:19 - 90:23)
pokemon return following you yep it is (90:23 - 90:28)
still weird that (90:26 - 90:29)
they just don't apply that to the (90:28 - 90:31)
current wild area (90:29 - 90:33)
yeah that would be a very free that (90:31 - 90:34)
would be a very nice free (90:33 - 90:37)
update that they could do but yeah take (90:34 - 90:39)
a piece of advice from me (90:37 - 90:42)
if if you want creepy you're playing on (90:39 - 90:43)
halloween (90:42 - 90:45)
you want creepy vibes you own a (90:43 - 90:46)
bilacephalon (90:45 - 90:50)
makeup lecephalon come on in your party (90:46 - 90:53)
and walk around in the over world oh it (90:50 - 90:56)
just oh it's so freaky no no no it's (90:53 - 90:58)
great (90:56 - 91:01)
if you can't handle super freaky uh now (90:58 - 91:02)
lego (91:01 - 91:05)
will also give you a nice (91:02 - 91:08)
disturbing maybe not as creepy vibe i (91:05 - 91:10)
already have a problem with talonflame (91:08 - 91:13)
being angry when i stop (91:10 - 91:15)
isn't that great it's just like sister (91:13 - 91:18)
just like (91:15 - 91:20)
can't move on i want to fly i was (91:18 - 91:22)
personally disappointed no new ribbons (91:20 - 91:24)
for me i like collecting ribbons (91:22 - 91:28)
no new ribbons unfortunately but (91:24 - 91:32)
you can mark hunt (91:28 - 91:35)
for the galler birds (91:32 - 91:38)
the glarion articuno zapdos small trays (91:35 - 91:39)
they can have a mark on them (91:38 - 91:42)
which is not a ribbon but appears in the (91:39 - 91:43)
ribbon tab so good enough for me (91:42 - 91:46)
uh those those three pokemon are shiny (91:43 - 91:47)
locked so you can't get them shiny (91:46 - 91:48)
anyways (91:47 - 91:51)
uh but you can mark hunt them so that's (91:48 - 91:52)
exciting (91:51 - 91:54)
uh and i think is that your next hunt (91:52 - 91:55)
are you gonna hunt oh (91:54 - 91:57)
marks yeah i'm definitely gonna mark (91:55 - 92:00)
hunt those personality or higher (91:57 - 92:02)
uh so i don't want weather and i don't (92:00 - 92:03)
want um (92:02 - 92:06)
there's rankings of markings the like (92:03 - 92:06)
the (92:06 - 92:09)
uncommon mark is like the most common (92:06 - 92:10)
and then there's like the weather (92:09 - 92:12)
and then there's like time of day that (92:10 - 92:14)
would be like morning or or (92:12 - 92:17)
whatever dosy um and then there's (92:14 - 92:18)
personality (92:17 - 92:19)
so and then and the only thing higher (92:18 - 92:21)
than personality is the rare mark which (92:19 - 92:23)
is a one in a thousand chance which is (92:21 - 92:27)
three and one in 333 if with the mark (92:23 - 92:28)
charm (92:27 - 92:31)
so i will mark up those i think (92:28 - 92:33)
everyone who's encountered the birds are (92:31 - 92:35)
happy with how they did it (92:33 - 92:38)
uh i think the common theme here is in (92:35 - 92:38)
in (92:38 - 92:40)
in past and i'm trying not to be a (92:38 - 92:42)
spoiler i think people (92:40 - 92:43)
people were definitely really (92:42 - 92:44)
disappointed in x and y with how they (92:43 - 92:46)
handled zygarde (92:44 - 92:47)
with how they handled mewtwo they just (92:46 - 92:49)
kind of plopped them in a cave (92:47 - 92:52)
and overall kind of since x and y maybe (92:49 - 92:54)
even like black and white (92:52 - 92:55)
i would say most people have kind of (92:54 - 92:56)
been disappointed that legendary (92:55 - 92:59)
encounters don't feel legendary (92:56 - 93:00)
i wouldn't say that dynamaxx adventure (92:59 - 93:02)
makes legendary pokemon feel legendary (93:00 - 93:04)
although they are fun (93:02 - 93:06)
but i think they did the regis here and (93:04 - 93:07)
how they did the (93:06 - 93:11)
birds i think answered those issues that (93:07 - 93:12)
people had (93:11 - 93:13)
i think we can go more in depth than (93:12 - 93:15)
that next week yeah i haven't (93:13 - 93:17)
pursued those paths yet there are (93:15 - 93:19)
there's a diglett equivalent in this (93:17 - 93:21)
game (93:19 - 93:23)
you guys have seen that i have i think (93:21 - 93:24)
it's okay we talk about this (93:23 - 93:28)
uh the swords of justice are (93:24 - 93:30)
in the game they are not in dynamics (93:28 - 93:31)
adventure (93:30 - 93:33)
they are in the crown tundra you have to (93:31 - 93:36)
find their footprints to make them spawn (93:33 - 93:39)
the only one that i'm confused about (93:36 - 93:42)
as to where to go next is (93:39 - 93:45)
parisian i think once they spawn they (93:42 - 93:46)
stand there they don't like (93:45 - 93:49)
i think so run around and i believe they (93:46 - 93:50)
stand there but (93:49 - 93:52)
like finding the truth i i'm i know (93:50 - 93:54)
where to find the tracks for the other (93:52 - 93:55)
two but like (93:54 - 93:57)
after my initial attempt i'm like and (93:55 - 93:59)
i'm out of the (93:57 - 94:01)
these tracks and i don't know where to (93:59 - 94:03)
go so because it's the task that sonia (94:01 - 94:03)
gives you (94:03 - 94:06)
yes yes oh man i thought that was the (94:03 - 94:07)
legendary birds (94:06 - 94:09)
all right i think for the birds you just (94:07 - 94:10)
go to the tree (94:09 - 94:13)
you just go to the tree yeah so there (94:10 - 94:14)
there are four (94:13 - 94:16)
there are four legendary things one is (94:14 - 94:18)
sonia with the musketeers (94:16 - 94:21)
one is the birds at the tree one is (94:18 - 94:21)
calorics (94:21 - 94:24)
and then the last one is the regies so (94:21 - 94:25)
that is (94:24 - 94:28)
the i guess the they're all legendary (94:25 - 94:30)
and they're all the story of this game (94:28 - 94:32)
which the crown if if the olive armor (94:30 - 94:34)
was very battle heavy which it was (94:32 - 94:38)
move tudors dojo uh urshi fu being (94:34 - 94:39)
extremely competitive and annoying in (94:38 - 94:42)
in ranked battles um this is all about (94:39 - 94:43)
legendaries (94:42 - 94:46)
i think when when people i i would i (94:43 - 94:48)
would probably say if anyone is like i (94:46 - 94:50)
like the crown tundra better (94:48 - 94:51)
probably because they don't care about (94:50 - 94:53)
competitive which is fine like that is (94:51 - 94:55)
totally okay right you don't have to (94:53 - 94:57)
like every aspect of pokemon (94:55 - 94:59)
in order to like pokemon but there's no (94:57 - 95:01)
denying that the olive armor was (94:59 - 95:04)
built around mints and and (95:01 - 95:07)
uh move tutors and vitamins and ev (95:04 - 95:08)
training and (95:07 - 95:10)
even you know restrictive sparring (95:08 - 95:12)
really taught you that you should ev (95:10 - 95:15)
train to be competitive yep you need to (95:12 - 95:17)
collect 50 tracks for each (95:15 - 95:21)
so that good old 150 number (95:17 - 95:23)
uh but there are more than 50 tracks so (95:21 - 95:25)
there are if that (95:23 - 95:26)
you you don't have to be precise it's (95:25 - 95:28)
not like diglett where you're going to (95:26 - 95:30)
spend two hours looking for one diglett (95:28 - 95:32)
there are more than 50 um so just keep (95:30 - 95:33)
that in mind (95:32 - 95:35)
only other thing i think we can maybe (95:33 - 95:37)
talk about is that there is (95:35 - 95:39)
kind of a disappointing reward for (95:37 - 95:41)
completing your pokedex this time around (95:39 - 95:42)
uh for completing your pokedex in the (95:41 - 95:44)
crown tundra or sorry in the isle of (95:42 - 95:46)
armor you got the (95:44 - 95:48)
marked charm which i guess maybe some (95:46 - 95:49)
people wouldn't care about i (95:48 - 95:51)
i did i definitely did uh you got the (95:49 - 95:53)
mark charm you got a crown you got your (95:51 - 95:54)
certificate (95:53 - 95:56)
in this you do get a clothing item i (95:54 - 95:58)
don't want to spoil it (95:56 - 96:00)
uh but there's no charm uh you get three (95:58 - 96:02)
golden bottle caps 50 rare candy the (96:00 - 96:04)
certificate and a clothing item that i (96:02 - 96:06)
will not spoil so that's all you get for (96:04 - 96:07)
completing your pokedex what other charm (96:06 - 96:08)
would they have (96:07 - 96:11)
though uh yeah i don't know um hit i (96:08 - 96:11)
mean (96:11 - 96:13)
the only gonna give i would say hidden (96:11 - 96:16)
charm but you can only get hidden in (96:13 - 96:19)
raids and that wouldn't apply (96:16 - 96:22)
we're hitting ability well the game (96:19 - 96:23)
training time (96:22 - 96:25)
charm at the beginning of the crown (96:23 - 96:26)
tundra or at the isle of armor remember (96:25 - 96:28)
they give you that free (96:26 - 96:31)
get bonus experience maybe like a catch (96:28 - 96:34)
charm that makes catching even easier (96:31 - 96:35)
but you get that (96:34 - 96:36)
you get that already you get that (96:35 - 96:38)
critical account yeah the critical catch (96:36 - 96:38)
charm (96:38 - 96:42)
from the main story yeah well like a (96:38 - 96:45)
super critical catch charm okay so (96:42 - 96:48)
uh the the last thing i want to talk (96:45 - 96:50)
about because yeah the catch (96:48 - 96:50)
it's been a long time since we had (96:52 - 97:00)
to catch a legendary pokemon yeah (96:57 - 97:02)
this is not a spoiler you do catch (97:00 - 97:04)
calorics at one point i think this is (97:02 - 97:05)
obvious (97:04 - 97:07)
is that a spoiler that the legendary (97:05 - 97:09)
pokemon presented that's like saying hey (97:07 - 97:11)
zamasu and zashian on the cover of these (97:09 - 97:13)
games you get to catch those dudes (97:11 - 97:17)
catch those it is so frustrating to me (97:13 - 97:20)
that they they spent a dlc (97:17 - 97:23)
dedicated to competitiveness they gave (97:20 - 97:25)
you a better way to get vitamins (97:23 - 97:27)
they gave you the move tutors they (97:25 - 97:28)
introduced your shifu (97:27 - 97:30)
they got bottle caps and gold and bottle (97:28 - 97:32)
caps all that stuff (97:30 - 97:35)
and yet not every pokemon (97:32 - 97:39)
you want to catch should have perfect (97:35 - 97:40)
ivs which is weird to say (97:39 - 97:43)
and i'll explain there are certain (97:40 - 97:44)
pokemon in the game (97:43 - 97:47)
that that slower is better (97:44 - 97:49)
and it's not a and one of the reasons (97:47 - 97:51)
would be trick room trick room in (97:49 - 97:52)
competitive (97:51 - 97:55)
reverses the turn order so um a slower (97:52 - 97:56)
pokemon goes first (97:55 - 97:59)
a faster pokemon goes last and that is (97:56 - 98:01)
based off the speed stat but there is (97:59 - 98:05)
also things that are based off of um (98:01 - 98:06)
there are moves that use the speed stat (98:05 - 98:08)
or there's moves that use the attack (98:06 - 98:09)
stat or (98:08 - 98:12)
like um foul play it does more damage (98:09 - 98:14)
depending on how high the opponent's (98:12 - 98:15)
attack stat is (98:14 - 98:18)
you know if you're running a gengar who (98:15 - 98:20)
is a special attacker you probably don't (98:18 - 98:21)
want to have a high attack stat because (98:20 - 98:23)
you're weak to foul play (98:21 - 98:27)
um so it's not specifically speed (98:23 - 98:30)
but if if for whatever reason not (98:27 - 98:30)
spoilers (98:30 - 98:34)
aside i want a very slow calorics (98:30 - 98:36)
because i want to use calorics in trick (98:34 - 98:37)
room (98:36 - 98:38)
people know what i'm talking about i'm (98:37 - 98:41)
just trying to beat around the bush here (98:38 - 98:45)
but i have no way (98:41 - 98:49)
of getting a slow speed calorics (98:45 - 98:52)
without soft resetting which (98:49 - 98:54)
i think we've established at this point (98:52 - 98:56)
in the games that game freak doesn't (98:54 - 98:58)
want us to suffer set anymore (98:56 - 99:01)
right i think they locked the starters (98:58 - 99:02)
they lock type no (99:01 - 99:05)
they like sashi and zamasena they locked (99:02 - 99:06)
all of these right (99:05 - 99:08)
even the regis if you wanted to shiny (99:06 - 99:10)
out the regis (99:08 - 99:13)
you can actually just defeat them and lo (99:10 - 99:14)
and behold they (99:13 - 99:17)
respawn again and or you could run away (99:14 - 99:19)
and lo and behold they're still there (99:17 - 99:21)
um which is what a lot of people liked (99:19 - 99:23)
about omega ruby alpha sapphire latios (99:21 - 99:25)
latias you could just run away (99:23 - 99:28)
i think running away or defeating uh (99:25 - 99:31)
is a better way to interact with your (99:28 - 99:32)
game than turning it on (99:31 - 99:35)
and turning it back off again uh and (99:32 - 99:38)
yet there they still have not solved (99:35 - 99:40)
this issue of (99:38 - 99:41)
if i am actually trying to be (99:40 - 99:43)
competitive and i do want to control (99:41 - 99:44)
certain stats i can (99:43 - 99:47)
always make stats better if i if i (99:44 - 99:49)
caught you know if by starter score (99:47 - 99:50)
bunny (99:49 - 99:51)
you know didn't have perfect ivs i can (99:50 - 99:53)
use a bottle cap i can use a golden (99:51 - 99:55)
bottle cap i can use a mint (99:53 - 99:57)
i have so much control the thing i (99:55 - 99:58)
cannot do is i cannot (99:57 - 100:02)
decrease a stat i and and if if if (99:58 - 100:05)
trick room or any other sort of game (100:02 - 100:06)
mode (100:05 - 100:10)
i need stats to be a certain point (100:06 - 100:12)
i have no control over that and so i am (100:10 - 100:14)
stuck (100:12 - 100:17)
with soft resetting because that is the (100:14 - 100:20)
only option you have given me game freak (100:17 - 100:23)
uh there's room service oh gosh okay i (100:20 - 100:24)
was going to say the same (100:23 - 100:27)
thing i'm going to put room service on (100:24 - 100:28)
this pokemon (100:27 - 100:29)
because i need it to hold a different (100:28 - 100:33)
item well that's your problem (100:29 - 100:36)
they clearly gave you room service so on (100:33 - 100:37)
top of that (100:36 - 100:40)
a catch rate of three which uh is (100:37 - 100:42)
is has been the catch rate for a long (100:40 - 100:44)
time legendary there there's (100:42 - 100:47)
uh each pokemon have different catch (100:44 - 100:48)
rates right the highest catch rate you (100:47 - 100:49)
can get is a pidgey which i think is (100:48 - 100:50)
255. (100:49 - 100:52)
the lowest cash rate you can get is a (100:50 - 100:54)
mythical or a legendary pokemon like (100:52 - 100:54)
mewtwo (100:54 - 100:56)
um articuno zapdos you know these have a (100:54 - 100:58)
catch rates of three same in the ultra (100:56 - 100:59)
wormhole you know when you found (100:58 - 101:00)
guaranteed in the ultra wormhole also (100:59 - 101:02)
had to catch rate of three (101:00 - 101:05)
it's so many pokeballs (101:02 - 101:08)
to try to catch they hand you another (101:05 - 101:09)
master ball (101:08 - 101:12)
i am not going to waste my master ball (101:09 - 101:15)
on a static encounter because the second (101:12 - 101:15)
i do (101:15 - 101:18)
the second i do i'm gonna catch calorics (101:15 - 101:20)
in a master ball i'm gonna take two feet (101:18 - 101:21)
into an absol which is shiny and it's (101:20 - 101:23)
gonna use paris song and i'm gonna be (101:21 - 101:24)
like i don't have a master ball anymore (101:23 - 101:25)
and it doesn't mean (101:24 - 101:27)
i have a fundamental question that you (101:25 - 101:28)
probably can't answer because i (101:27 - 101:30)
i can't answer it how did i end up with (101:28 - 101:31)
five master balls (101:30 - 101:34)
you get one master ball in the story (101:31 - 101:35)
yeah (101:34 - 101:38)
you get another master ball in the uh (101:35 - 101:39)
isle of armor right they give you one (101:38 - 101:41)
yeah you get another master ball crown (101:39 - 101:42)
tundra (101:41 - 101:44)
yeah where did they be a master ball in (101:42 - 101:46)
the isle of armor did they know (101:44 - 101:50)
no not that i remember i (101:46 - 101:52)
i i think they did i have five i don't (101:50 - 101:54)
know how i got five (101:52 - 101:56)
you won the lotto i have not won the (101:54 - 101:58)
lotto (101:56 - 102:00)
did you did you get surprised traded a (101:58 - 102:02)
pokemon holding a master ball released (102:00 - 102:03)
that pokemon master ball (102:02 - 102:04)
didn't know that the pokemon was holding (102:03 - 102:06)
the master ball then automatically went (102:04 - 102:07)
inventory (102:06 - 102:10)
i mean that's possible that is possible (102:07 - 102:12)
i have six master balls but the only (102:10 - 102:14)
reason i have so many is because i sped (102:12 - 102:15)
run the game (102:14 - 102:17)
got the master ball didn't use it then (102:15 - 102:20)
gave it to a pokemon traded it to myself (102:17 - 102:21)
and then deleted the save to speedrun (102:20 - 102:23)
again so every time i sped run i saved (102:21 - 102:24)
the master ball for myself (102:23 - 102:27)
uh i will say that i since i had only (102:24 - 102:29)
spent 10 balls catching (102:27 - 102:31)
uh i think your argument is done void (102:29 - 102:33)
because it didn't take me that long so (102:31 - 102:36)
get better oh okay anyways i've in my (102:33 - 102:39)
20 hours of the dlc experience three (102:36 - 102:39)
hours have been (102:39 - 102:41)
in front of calorics throwing from your (102:39 - 102:43)
balls (102:41 - 102:45)
resetting luxury balls and it only took (102:43 - 102:46)
me ten so (102:45 - 102:48)
hey luxury bomb premiere will have the (102:46 - 102:50)
same catcher yeah i'm just saying they (102:48 - 102:51)
do wait no they do (102:50 - 102:53)
they do they do yeah that's what i'm (102:51 - 102:55)
saying steve get better (102:53 - 102:57)
they have almost gotten to the point (102:55 - 102:58)
where they have eliminated software (102:57 - 102:59)
setting (102:58 - 103:02)
altogether in their games almost (102:59 - 103:04)
the only thing they need to do for (103:02 - 103:05)
competitive at this point is (103:04 - 103:09)
give me an npc give me an item (103:05 - 103:13)
let me zero out an iv stat (103:09 - 103:15)
whether that's attack special attack or (103:13 - 103:17)
speed like those are the three i (103:15 - 103:19)
you would never need to zero out i don't (103:17 - 103:20)
think defense or special (103:19 - 103:23)
that's not true um you would want to (103:20 - 103:24)
zero out (103:23 - 103:28)
defense if you were running is (103:24 - 103:31)
stupid dumb complicated like for (103:28 - 103:34)
for like a pokemon like i think celestia (103:31 - 103:37)
celestillo's like best attack is it's (103:34 - 103:39)
is celestial the right example or is it (103:37 - 103:41)
niley go anyways one of the altar beasts (103:39 - 103:43)
if you don't know how beast boos works (103:41 - 103:46)
beast boosts would boost their best (103:43 - 103:50)
stat so if uh ultra beast's best at was (103:46 - 103:51)
attacked (103:50 - 103:53)
was attack when you knock out a pokemon (103:51 - 103:55)
then the attack stat gets a boost (103:53 - 103:58)
whereas if the ultra beast's best set (103:55 - 104:00)
was defense if you not got a pokemon the (103:58 - 104:01)
pokemon will get a defense boost i think (104:00 - 104:03)
it is (104:01 - 104:06)
stack attacka where if you were to have (104:03 - 104:08)
zero its best attack is defense but if (104:06 - 104:10)
you were to zero out if it's (104:08 - 104:13)
out its defense but have a (104:10 - 104:16)
hindering nature on the defense you can (104:13 - 104:18)
actually push its attack to be (104:16 - 104:20)
higher than its defense so then when (104:18 - 104:21)
stack attacker (104:20 - 104:22)
defeats a pokemon instead of getting a (104:21 - 104:25)
defense boost it gets an attack boost (104:22 - 104:29)
so this isn't just like the zeroing out (104:25 - 104:32)
stats is is more so it is not only (104:29 - 104:34)
restricted to trick room there's (104:32 - 104:35)
many reasons why you wouldn't want to do (104:34 - 104:37)
it so that's like the last thing we need (104:35 - 104:40)
competitively is something to do that (104:37 - 104:42)
otherwise i'm stuck in front of calorics (104:40 - 104:43)
for two hours resetting (104:42 - 104:46)
and that's not fun because i could be (104:43 - 104:47)
playing dynamics adventure which is you (104:46 - 104:48)
could just be using (104:47 - 104:50)
room service no i'm not going to use (104:48 - 104:52)
room service well that's your problem (104:50 - 104:53)
then this is the item then your price (104:52 - 104:55)
for not doing what they give you is (104:53 - 104:56)
sitting in front of calories yeah two (104:55 - 104:56)
hours (104:56 - 104:58)
they gave you a solution you don't want (104:56 - 105:02)
to take room service is not good (104:58 - 105:05)
it's not good can we talk about (105:02 - 105:09)
one more thing uh (105:05 - 105:11)
yes all right this is a little spoilery (105:09 - 105:13)
nothing to do with the story what you're (105:11 - 105:15)
cutting to get this in and i'm not happy (105:13 - 105:16)
about it uh (105:15 - 105:19)
no question of the week this week right (105:16 - 105:20)
g (105:19 - 105:22)
we're running real late in time uh will (105:20 - 105:24)
give us our pokemon of the week (105:22 - 105:27)
so last week's pokemon of the week what (105:24 - 105:29)
did i have to say about that dude (105:27 - 105:33)
uh well greg you were there (105:29 - 105:36)
i was there greg and i were having lunch (105:33 - 105:38)
i got invited to a (105:36 - 105:41)
remote raid and somebody in indianapolis (105:38 - 105:42)
and i was like (105:41 - 105:44)
why did you bother to do a remote remote (105:42 - 105:46)
raid for that one (105:44 - 105:49)
uh it's a first (105:46 - 105:53)
level pokemon that likes to do (105:49 - 105:56)
building buildings and it shares its (105:53 - 105:57)
name with the (105:56 - 105:59)
as i called it non-held item that it (105:57 - 106:01)
holds yes (105:59 - 106:02)
because it's like right because farfetch (106:01 - 106:04)
has a leak yeah it's like why doesn't (106:02 - 106:07)
this dude have a (106:04 - 106:09)
plank (106:07 - 106:09)
all right who's that pokemon it's (106:12 - 106:17)
chat it's never chat except for the one (106:17 - 106:22)
time that it was (106:20 - 106:25)
it's timber (106:22 - 106:27)
timber you are correct because you were (106:25 - 106:28)
at the table (106:27 - 106:31)
i was so confused because i was like you (106:28 - 106:33)
want me to use a rewrote remote raid (106:31 - 106:33)
pass (106:33 - 106:37)
for a timber timber (106:33 - 106:39)
and did you use that remote pad you did (106:37 - 106:41)
i did and i didn't have a timber in my (106:39 - 106:42)
pokedex so (106:41 - 106:45)
you know it all worked out in the end (106:42 - 106:45)
what is uh (106:45 - 106:49)
oh wait timber uh the machamp (106:45 - 106:54)
there's not a lot machop wannabe yeah (106:49 - 106:55)
there's not a lot about it (106:54 - 106:57)
uh timber and machop are both fighting (106:55 - 106:59)
type pokemon with a base that total of (106:57 - 107:01)
305 gender ratio is 75 (106:59 - 107:04)
male 25 female most (107:01 - 107:06)
commonly associated with construction (107:04 - 107:07)
sites in their respective regions (107:06 - 107:11)
they have guts as a possibility (107:07 - 107:12)
and they both reach their final (107:11 - 107:14)
evolution by having to trade (107:12 - 107:18)
evolve got a pretty good but not great (107:14 - 107:20)
shuffle leica all right you ready for (107:18 - 107:21)
this week (107:20 - 107:25)
born ready i can guarantee (107:21 - 107:30)
that no one is going to be able to get (107:25 - 107:31)
this one right (107:30 - 107:34)
without looking something up (107:31 - 107:36)
nobody's gonna be able to do it off the (107:34 - 107:38)
top of their head guaranteed (107:36 - 107:42)
here we go last night i was on a dynamax (107:38 - 107:43)
adventure with a buddy (107:42 - 107:46)
when one of the rental pokemon that is (107:43 - 107:46)
offered (107:46 - 107:50)
well it took me completely by surprise i (107:46 - 107:52)
thought it was a glitch (107:50 - 107:54)
someone had misspelled pukamuku or (107:52 - 107:56)
something (107:54 - 107:58)
no though it was a real pokemon from (107:56 - 107:59)
galler that i had just (107:58 - 108:03)
completely forgotten about i guess this (107:59 - 108:05)
pokemon falls into that class of pokemon (108:03 - 108:07)
where you expect them to be one type (108:05 - 108:09)
but they are actually something (108:07 - 108:11)
completely different (108:09 - 108:12)
this coming from someone who decided to (108:11 - 108:14)
play through the crown tundra with an (108:12 - 108:16)
all ultra beast team (108:14 - 108:19)
i am not talking pseudowudo level more (108:16 - 108:21)
of a consideration that the pokemon (108:19 - 108:22)
should be a water type (108:21 - 108:25)
when it is not in a way this week's (108:22 - 108:28)
pokemon is a cousin to stun fisk (108:25 - 108:30)
not glare in stunfisk though it shares (108:28 - 108:33)
typing with the original unova stun fisk (108:30 - 108:36)
the other factor i should point out and (108:33 - 108:37)
now more in common with galerin's (108:36 - 108:38)
sunfisk (108:37 - 108:41)
is be careful where you step (108:38 - 108:43)
accidentally stepping on one of these (108:41 - 108:46)
could be quite a shocking experience (108:43 - 108:48)
there you go (108:46 - 108:48)
if anybody remembers that this pokemon (108:50 - 108:53)
actually exists (108:52 - 109:00)
i i do i know i know what it is (108:53 - 109:02)
