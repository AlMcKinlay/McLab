what's up everyone welcome to the 432nd episode of the pokemon podcast it's super effective i am your host sbj with me greg hello uh i do need to share with the world uh my current pain and i'm i'm talking to you australia for the entire country all of australia they are all complicit in this brent has discovered a new streaming app that has allowed him to watch masterchef australia season one it is an unfathomable 72 episode long season oh man 72 episodes and the theme song they have playing is the worst song i have ever heard in my life isn't it no i wish i didn't even think for all i know it's not even the original song it's whatever they put on after like years later like that person's like no i'm gonna charge you a lot of money to play that internationally it is atrocious and it is an ear worm and it is stuck in my head and i don't want it there so australia one at most a season should be 23 episodes not 72 talk to your international and distribution and say just have silence silence to start the show just gentle pictures of people also they have the contestants doing the stupidest things at one point one of the contestants kisses a fish why nobody knows hey hey the fish is dead oh will is here i only need to complain about whoever in the pokemon world didn't watch jurassic park stop with all the amore no yeah they're not suited for this world they're so beautiful though they're why do you think i'm shiny hunting them but i'm real busy with other things right now that's all this show is just like you guys building up your complaints for a week and then airing them wow that's what you bring us on for oh it's true also if you didn't give us so much to complain about it wouldn't be so easy and if you weren't just a sellout shill we wouldn't have to present the other side of the argument steve i i'm not even sure what you're referring to this is that we could be going down for this all right we got a loaded show for you all mostly going to be talking about the crown tundra we will not be talking about story spoilers for the crown tundra although it is very short uh i guess we'll talk about the story next week um unless you're stuck in dynamic adventure or resetting for a reggie i probably have done the story it's not like terribly long i think it's i think it's longer than isle of armor though well isle of armor i guess this is not a spoiler armor is like one note it's like here's the cub food do the cub food this is like we have four things to investigate which one do you want to investigate in which order so if if boy isle of armor took me like 20 hours so this is basically gonna take me the rest of the year it is okay set aside some time i've i've played a lot i have it came out on friday i've put 20 hours into it in the last 48 hours i think it's a pretty good amount of time i think i have things to say i guess we're where do we want to start do we want to just start with dynamics adventure or do we want to start with general impressions let's do general impressions okay my first impression is for some reason i thought it was going to be an island again it clearly says it's a tundra yeah i i guess it was just kind of weird seeing the train do you expect steve to know what tundra means we live in the tundra it was just like oh we're we're taking the train to the thing and it's connected to the map already so that's wait didn't we take the train to the isle of armor though no cause no i gotta fly you gotta yeah yeah you go under the tunnel the non-existent tunnel between the isle of armor and it's like the english channel oh we did take a train to the alamo yeah you take a train yeah because the scientist ladies in the train station yeah but how does the train get there underground like the channel yeah uh i don't you guys can go um i'm still jarred about the not being an island so i would say the okay the things that kind of got me one the the top thing is i don't understand why there's a band of unless this is probably explained at some point in the story i haven't gotten to a band of snow in the south and a band of snow in the north but there's like warm areas on either side of both of them yeah i like the layout i i very much uh just kind of like the the terrain because one of my complaints of of of uh of galler is just that the routes are too short right so this is giving me like a really good area of and twists and turns and things to explore and i i'm happy with the pokemon that they've added i'm not happy that chespin is not one of them which was my one of my goals for this i think i remember my uncle at nintendo say if they brought chestnut over they would have had to strike the meteor back down and gather to kill all the fossils again oh you can't have them all living at once there you go the story is a little goofy but that's okay uh i'm i i've just been having fun i i decided that i first was going to do an all-star team so i went into pokemon home tm and just looked at my highest leveled pokemon and i was like oh these are the pokemon i played in previous games and i was like i'm going to grab my favorite ones of these and make a team out of them like like all all-time well you have to have six pokemon to play what there's the game zero trainer battles but but i'm still gonna run and encounter different wait there is a tree you walk out of the train station and you have to battle the dude yeah but then that what hydrogen it turns out wasn't doing too good uh so we put those guys away and now i have a team that is all ultra beasts and that is a lot of fun and extremely creepy because when you have ultra beasts following you in the in the overworld boy did they decide to creep out the animations for those guys i want my talent oh you know what's fun it's like when you stop walking talonflame like lands behind you sits there and then yells at you just like my cat that's why talonflame had to go away um and then i would say the one story thing i will not give any specifics but i did walk into somebody's house and i was like how does they have that pokemon what that was my exact reaction i don't think i think it's a spoiler it's literally pretty it's not like hidden behind anything well but for somebody who hasn't played the game at all they i also want them to have the reaction of how did what that pokemon okay that's fair so there you go the map is very cool but i get lost all the time uh and i want for is more than on the isle of armor i want a mini map for this one because i can't tell where i am because because of the weird band of snow and there's multiple points of access i get lost all the time um i like the story i think the story is better than isle of armor so i'm happy there all of it or which part of like the multiple paths are you going all right uh i will say legendary story one which is the one i've completed i think i think it's very pretty like i do think it looks great um even like they took even better than the isle of armor i just think it looks very good i am slightly disappointed i just sort of felt like you could have added more missing pokemon than you did that feels a little well the problem is to me the 100 pokemon they added like 60 of them are either legendaries or ultra beasts right so it's so then when you have like neato king and nidoqueen you're like well that's another six yeah i mean it's just like the walking around in the real world there's a lot of ones that i've already seen before and that's a little that was just a little it's not terrible but i'm like you could have you could have easily added more of the old ones here and had those been a bigger surprise than like zubat is back and as awful as ever yeah somebody if somebody had that company love zubat i i don't know why or who but stop stop it's just stop don't worry if they're gonna keep to their word of not every pokemon will be in every pokemon game going forward maybe make the cut so i think that i think this sort of the lack of added in pokemon was a little disappointing i think everything's beautiful there are there are things that i did in there that i didn't expect and they were big surprises um i don't know like you can shake every tree no matter their size and things will happen mm-hmm and that was like yeah that was a fun surprise i one thing i also wanted to say now that it just came to mind is i wish they would just stop reformat the games stop doing character animations because you guys obviously don't understand how humans move or interact with each other so please it's it's it's creepy and disturbing the the thing that i couldn't help notice is like this is in the original wild area there is the you know the initial same complaints got lost very big love it confusing wish there was a map i think this applies to every new area but there are no like houses in that and technically the olive armor is all considered a wild area and there's only one house just the dojo right oh there's a house and then there's the two two towers the two towers and then never again yeah but i will say they are good markers they are good markers and then they they did a little village in the crown tundra which is like oh cool maybe we're getting closer to having this as being the norm and i think that's kind of what a lot of people are are hoping for or reaching for is they want the whole game to be wild area however you describe that that's the best i could describe it i don't know oh they want the game to be open world but that little village is like like three houses and four people it's four houses there's one point where the game tells you like talk to all the villagers yeah and you're like oh the three like i gotta talk to betty and shirley over here and then i gotta talk to them there's still one that i missed and i was like where is this i i swear i've talked to it oh it's because they used the same character model for three of you yeah yep it's like it's not the person that's just sitting there that's not okay they can do 800 plus pokemon models but time and time again we're only allowed 12 character mods we have we have long since determined that triplets quadruplets are very very common in the pokemon world uh i like peony a lot though um i do too he is very cringe-worthy in like the good ways yeah the daughter uh like not as memorable to me i think well she's there very briefly well she's always in the cave telling you that she'll heggle you a legendary for five die right or die night ores she gave me a an item yeah this is actually the thing i i'm a little disappointed and not that big of a deal but when you uh unlock the isle the crown the isle of armor the owl of crown tundra the olive armor um you just can't just go back to the old stores and buy the new clothing but there's no shopping pass in the crown tundra it seems like the main way to get clothing is in between dynamaxx adventures you have to remember to talk to her yeah she will give you clothing items in between she'll be like oh i found this on the floor i don't like it here's for you so if you want like team flares goggles or get i i haven't talked to her enough she gives you all that but you have to remember to talk to her in between and if she says like i have a landorus for five dinite ore you can say no and then talk to her again and then she'll be like i found this uh hat would you like it oh i was only talking to her once between raids i will keep talking yeah every every time in between just talk to her i honestly thought by the style of her hair that she was more tied to the legend of this pass than she is i don't wait what's the what's the issue that i mean peony wants to do dynamex adventure yeah and she wants to do dynamics adventure but she doesn't want to do it with him is that just though that's the whole no no no no no no no no he wants to do the legendary tour did you not see his child like so he planned out an entire tour of the entire crown tundra to do all of these things and she did not include the dynomax adventure because she thinks it's too dangerous oh okay okay okay only wants to do dynamics adventures so she pawns her dad off on you yeah i literally when i first met her and she turned around and she has that bulbous crown like hairstyle i thought oh she's tied she's gonna be the one that's gonna start off this whole this whole legendary kale rick's adventure and nope she just sits in a cave uh do we wanna talk about dynamics adventure yeah i mean it's what i've spent most of my time doing in the ground tundra yeah i have done um i've done about 24 25 dynamics adventures uh which is a lot a lot it's four like four pokemon times 25 is a hundred so i guess i've seen 100 pokemon at this point so it is a little bit different than we thought it was going to be um i was expecting like four to five pokemon before legendary it's a hard three yep it looks like more because of the the branching pass but they they branch it in a way where you're only doing three the other thing is which is very different is there are no shields on these pokemon yep not even on the legendary and it they still must have i think it's because of the rentals or like i'm i'm sure all the rentals were made in in a way but the most i've ever been able to do damage wise to a single pokemon is about 50 percent so it was possible to like two shot a pokemon i mean it's hard it's hard yeah but you really have to have a good like the exact right combination for that to happen even with no shields the whole process which which i was saying for a couple weeks is is is almost 20 minutes like you are it yeah from start to finish it's about 20 minutes i started i timed every one i did or for the sake of this conversation the fastest i was ever able to do it was 15 minutes the longest it took me for one was 22 minutes but on average i was completing almost all of them in about 17 18 minutes and that's not counting the time it takes to get the the group together i started the timer i started the timer once we started picking our um once everyone hit ready i started the timer and you never had to play with npcs right i played with uh we had in in the 24 25 i did we had two people disconnect um and so an npc filled their slot and it was i don't know my first my first run through was all npcs i did the first one by myself because and i was like what was funny is the person that disconnected because i was streaming this on twitch they got three npcs in their place so they were still in the dynamex adventure huh and we got the one npc for that person and they were able to get to the legend and beat the legend before us well it's like the npcs either do absolutely the worst choices or they do like yeah that was a good idea thanks for coordinating and doing that the right way right they are very hit or miss uh when they are hit they're great so i know i know people want us to talk about this uh i will disclose here that there are there is a data miner this data miner has been wrong in the past this data miner has been right in the past this is the same data miner that cerabi used but they initially tweeted that um dynamics adventure had no increased shiny odds based on the player id this is getting really complicated but pretty much your player id that the game assigns you which is what you can see on your trainer card it's like probably like one one two seven six nine or whatever that number is what rolls the thing that determines a shiny and they ultimately said that like there was no extra rolls going through dynamics adventure without the shiny charm that they saw and then about an hour later they looked at a different thing and ultimately to make this easy it's pretty similar to the wormhole stuff so if you remember ultra wormholes and ultrasound ultramoon there was a base percentage i think it was a base one percent of pokemon being shiny we're talking about the 20 pokemon not the legendary pokemon so that's like the altaria the um obama snow the hip-hop sounds like you've seen some fun ones because i think i saw masculine about eight times the escalator is not in the outdoor moles no no baskins on the dynamax oh dynamics adventure yeah yeah yeah so those pokemon had a base one percent to be shiny in in the ultra wormholes but the ultra wormhole determined didn't use your shiny charm or your player id it determined how many rings the wormhole had and how far you went and it went from like one percent to like i can't remember it was like maybe 36 percent a chance of being shiny doing that so the data miner then discovered i'm only putting this disclaimer because there could be more to it there could be less to it remember we the data miner originally thought there was chaining involved with uh overworld method that with the shiny charm there is a one in a hundred chance per pokemon you encounter and you encounter four a dynamax run with your uh there's a one in a hundred chance that that pokemon will be shiny at the end of the adventure they're never they're never shiny while you're fighting them yeah everyone will have a different role at the end um so will could get shiny masculine and i could not get shiny masculine for example and if you don't have the shiny charm you have a 1 in 300 chance because remember the shiny charm gives plus 2 of getting a shiny through the adventure so there is some misinformation about here where uh youtubers and other content creators are saying that it's a one in 25 chance of being shiny it's technically not true because well each encounter is a one in a hundred chance right you could i guess the way you you say that argument adventure the entire 20 minutes is a one in 25 chance yeah because if there's four chances out of a hundred basically right that one of them will be so every time you go on on a chance there's a one in 25 there's a 1025 chance that one of the four will be shiny so you're spending ultimately 20 minutes for community day odds yeah which i'm sure that was thought about right like there's it's yes um but but i was i was completely wrong in the sense that i didn't think they would do anything i just thought i thought there would be shields i thought there would be i thought it would just just like i thought everyone if it was shiny it would be shiny for everyone i thought shiny charm doesn't affect raids at the old raids so why would it affect these raids but also dynamics adventure doesn't even use y com no oh wait wait wait before we get there because we're still talking about catching and everything like that don't don't waste your good balls people yes it is guaranteed catch for everything get just poke ball premiere ball if you want to feel special yeah we there is no problem catching anything in these things that could that will come up in my list of complaints about dynamics adventures yeah for maybe somebody who hasn't purchased the dlc or maybe on the fence dynamics i love dynamics adventure i love it i love dynamics i love it a lot that i have minor minor i have minor complaints um but overall it is pretty much what i want to do every time i start up ground tundra right now i want to find people online i want to go and just like say hey let's run some let's let's run some layers let's let's see what we get because it's it's it is just really fun the fact that they added rentals so that everybody has a very specific like you aren't a level 100 power through it they're all calibrated to do very specific things you have to think of strategy you have to look at their moves you have to look at the layer and sort of plan out will this get me to the end like all of that is really exciting it's really exciting to like have like this minor puzzle of how to do this layer successfully you have to argue with your friends because they chose the wrong path or they didn't say what path they needed to do fast enough in that daggone ten second time it's real short and it's like 10 seconds to pick a path 10 seconds to pick an item if you come across a backpacker oh and rando scientists could you possibly mention could you just tell me which one you have the first time that happened i was ready to turn around i don't get violent but man that was i i was heading towards a water legendary i had an electric and the scientist said oh hey i have something to switch out and i was like well i haven't seen this before so sure uh and it gave me a poison type but i'm like sure sure this is absolutely the thing i do not need to finish this this layer uh never again i will say that as as a real sign of like approval of of the dynamics adventure part i mean i i literally sat for five hours yesterday non-stop just doing dynamaxx advice that is how much i enjoy doing them i have complaints of course i do oh i was just gonna explain what it was real quick for people who haven't oh sure go for it so uh uh when you when you go into dynamics adventure you can either partner up with uh npcs or you could just partner up random if you wanted to always get a group of real people you could probably type in six nine six nine six nine six nine or one one 11111 because um unlike why com it doesn't need people on your friends list right so you can just you can just type in a number um and then match with other people that have typed in that same number think of it more like uh surprise trade or not surprise trade but the bling trade link trade where it was broken before uh and then they added more numbers to fix it uh and then you get then you get three pokemon that will appear three rentals uh none of them will have held items you get to see their move sets uh these pokemon there i think there are i think sarah b says there's like 260 pokemon that you can pick the like exeggutor clefairy comfey celio uh like sigiliff like there's a bunch that come through that you probably you know most people don't maybe think of using throughout their adventures or whatnot anyways you see three you pick one a new one comes in and then the other two that were still there are left over no and then wait wait wait the person who's hosting the dynamax gets to pick first yes and then it's like the order that you joined they get to then select so yeah once that person picks one it's not like well there's only two left they slot in a new yeah it's like a very card game thing where they like flip over and they slot in and then so it's a draft yeah it's drafting and then everyone picks and then usually the start is two different ways and you know what the final legend will be based on the they show you one of the types of the final legend right so like if they show you ghost or if they show you dragon or if they show you psychic you're still yeah right you can kind of maybe think of what like if they're showing flying you'd be like well it could be lugia it could be ho-oh it could be zapdos it could be rayquaza like you you know it's at least not going to be circuitry right when you get to the end and then you you could take either path and you you have to play who's that pokemon very quickly because you can see right you can see a little bit of their outline depending on how big they are in the mist that they're hidden in and then there's a couple people along the way that uh probably influences the decision more than it should there are the scientist people um and they will be the one that will say i will give you a random pokemon good luck right well it's like it's like i will trade you the one that i have although i'm not going to tell you what it is for the one that you or the one that you have there and it's a the devil's bargain don't do it there are berries on the ground all that does is replenish your health not fully uh it replenishes your health it does not remove status condition like paralysis or poison or frozen um which then leads to the point of when you walk out of your first raid battle your hp your pp your everything is is is it does not get refreshed right it it is you are stuck at with where you stopped after each raid battle so you have to carry through with the health and everything that you ended the whatever raid battle you just came out of with the exception of swapping so yeah if you walked out of a raid battle with uh like a 20 hp left machoke you might be the one that wants to take the new pokemon not because you love the new pokemon but mostly because like you will probably faint going into the next battle and it's four faints for the entire adventure not four feints per raid right which gets to the other point of if you make it to the legendary and you only have one faint left and you faint uh you get kicked out of the dynamex adventure you still have the option to cut to pick one of the three pokemon you've caught prior to that because remember you catch three non-legend pokemons before the legend but you don't you have to do the whole thing over at that point but you still walk away i guess with the consolation prize and you still walk away with dinite ore as well the other things that you can find so there are berries barry's replenished there's the scientists she swaps you normally with a masculine and then there's the uh there's the hiker the back of the girl backpacker and she's probably the best one to talk to because she will give you a held item and sometimes i held items evo light which is huge if you have like charmeleon or exeggutor or clefairy or chansey because they benefit from evil light the other thing the exeggutor does not benefit from evil oh sorry i just like saying exeggutor because i keep using him but that is that is something that i want to bring up in the rental pokemon which was this was a little unexpected for me is a lot of non-fully evolved pokemon so you may get like a middle evolution um as like what you're look i took out kirim with a combustion okay that's all i wanted to say i think those are the three right the hiker the scientists and then the berries that's all i've seen i think that's all i've seen and yeah i it's it's uh every every pokemon has a 100 catch rate so you can use whatever pokeball you want on but again keep in mind that you do not know if the pokemon is shiny or you don't know if it's hidden ability well i guess you could maybe guess it was hidden ability what depending on how it well you know but you also see it when you get to choose it right i'm just saying like if you're if you really want a hidden ability g-max kingler and you were saving your lure ball for it oh you throw it and then when you get to the end you get to pick four pokemon and if you decide not to take the kingler you lose that lure ball forever yeah that's one of my complaints but also how excited was i that that they have the gigantomax pokemon in there yeah like i got a gigantic max butterfree which i didn't have because because of that so that i was super pumped for that um also shout out uh yes it's 150 dinite ore but you can now just buy these balls yep so that's pretty sweet yeah i don't think that rotates either so they've had i think they now have a way to get every pokeball if you want the apricorns you do the scam-o-matic which is a one percent or a one in one thousand chance if you want a safari ball or a sports ball which the sports ball is pretty cool we haven't had zero way to get sports ball outside of heart gold soul silver the bug catching contest and i this is the one way to get the beast ball now is to pay a hundred a hundred fifties a lot i think for beast that's a lot especially since the most i've ever gotten from a raid is ten yeah i think you can get up to twelve but i'm not sure what triggers the 12. i know that 10 is you get 8 for completing an adventure with friends yep and then you get 10 for completing an adventure with friends as long as there was no faints at all yes but i heard 12 is the most but i'm not sure how to get 12. i don't know how you get 12 i don't know what's left you take ah what yeah i don't know you don't swap out you oh it could be if you oh i don't know you don't swap out you don't take any damage that seems impossible that seems impossible that's yeah uh don't sleep on clefairy though if they present you clefairy clefairy's boss clefairy with friend guard like increases the the defense clefairy knows life dude oh clefairy is good oh cryogeneal which if you like criminal combustion or cry no cry twerkle is a great combo because cry triagonal is going to know that solar beam and not have to like spend its time charging up and it knows uh what's the one that does increases your special defense um not reflect light screen amnesia light yeah i will say uh a piece of advice on dynamaxx adventures um because i don't have a list of complaints like greg does so minor minor complaints stay with the positive um and i wish i had known this because kiram was literally the first one that i came across and now i'm like when you get to the end and you ha you're presented with your four that you caught in front of you um and you you can look at their stats right and you can check the stats and that's how you see if one of them is shiny um if you want the legendary as a shiny and it's not shiny in that run-through that you did take one of the other pokemon yep and leave the because then you can go back through and do that legendary some other time and have the opportunity so that's like how you can shiny hunt for a specific legendary and that you can save that raid so you can tell the person up front hold that as one of my three saved layers you save that path you save that path yeah and you can do this you still have to go through the entire well all the way through the up to the fourth one but yep um you don't get to just like pop straight back to kiram but still you you don't have to randomly hope that it pops up again either she'll hold on to three she'll hold on to and she can hold on to version exclusives um so like for example thundurus is exclusive to shield i think um so if you're a sword player and you join a shield raid and that that shield host takes you to thunderists you don't normally see thunderous in your game so i would recommend at the end saving the thunderous for yourself if you you know want to go back and get a certain nature or if you want to go for shiny because that this was like a very smart thing that they did is you know even if you don't care about shinies i mean obviously it seems like they built this in for people who did want to shiny hunt yep but let's say you know you just want an adamant whatever adamant solgaleo i don't even think that's the break nature but when you go through and your soul galileo's timid you can say like i'll pass on it um i'm waiting for this uh so you have you have the option to do that as well um you pick one at the end i think i think we talked about all the mechanics of it yeah i think so i can't think of anything left off like i like the con i i like that it's like a it's like a win and lose situation i like that you can just do it in the cave you just go to the cave yep everything's there you don't have to explore walk around you just get back in line say i'm looking for more people queue me up let's go but i do like the exploring of the other dens but also i have no desire to do the other dens because i just don't i mean i've done the other day the other days are so fun there's still things out there that i haven't yeah i think right into i if if if the pokemon company was to do like another wailord weekend or another clefable weekend or another pikachu weekend i i think those are fun and i think that's good um yeah it's just you know if if somebody at this point has played through the base game has played through the isle of armor there's not a lot of new pokemon to do those dens for like i can't see the needle kings i can see the amoras i can see the kabutos ex in the wild and the zubats and i'm not sure what i would need to go to a den for at this point i have all the gigantic pokemon i you know maybe maybe if i was hidden ability hunting something yeah it was hidden below honey but there are because everything's still weather based there are some like that i didn't see in the over world that i did run into fossil pokemon in raid guns and i did do those so they were i you know i know they're in the game i don't know what under what weather conditions they'll show up but here's a raid and i can just do it here so i'll just do it like i'm already checking them to get the watts so if it's one that i haven't had before i might as well just throw it up um like yesterday i ran into armaldo i ran into gmax gengar i ran into a sable eye that i thought i'd just do for shiny so there were things that i was like well i'm already here i might as well throw it up and it also appears in the y comb which dynamics adventures don't yeah oh that complaint one the the other thing is the catching you just wanna expand on that a bit so like if you're going through and you're shiny hunting landorus for example and you decide not to catch landorus obviously you have to go through the whole 20 minutes to get the shiny check again even though at the end we now know with the asterisks unless something changes from the data miner that it's a one in a hundred chance every time you encounter landorus for it to be shiny if you have the shiny charm if you have the shiny term thing not everybody does right if you catch the landorus then you will never get another landorus to catch you can still battle landorus's in the future you just will not have the option to catch them once you catch yours now this is i've never seen this before but i've gotten a lot of questions this weekend hey if i caught my suicune and i release it into the wild the suicune come back into my dynamics adventure no do not do that don't do that which is why i'm happy that i have a copy of both games so that when i meet kiram again i will not just keep it yeah i mean i kept my sweet goon but i already had a shiny suicune since that was the first one that i did and i wasn't sure if it was increased shiny odds or not so i just caught it to see what that experience was yeah i wonder if everybody gets sweet as their first i did not i got uh okay some didn't i i think it's i think it's as random as everything else but yeah suicune was my first and a few others but there was a lot of people's first did you i i wonder if suicune was your first because you did npc oh possibly oh yeah i did mine fully solo i did mine so i did my first one with a group and i got uh i got like evil tall or something um bacon last week i i was like i'm not gonna shiny hunt these because i'm not going i'm not going to do a one in four thousand for 20 minutes it is 20 minutes still it is 20 minutes but it's a one in a hundred chance uh which is fun it's one in a hundred and it's a good time yeah and it's a good like it's so much like doing these battles even though they're ray battles because you're forced in these situations to use pokemon you're not used to yeah because people forget i mean i've had we've we've lost like i've lost before i got to landers which is really frustrating you know you could be like oh it's one in 100 for landorus well let me try to at least get there because somebody picked a miraculous and the other three people picked water pokemon and now maractus is just sucking up every water movement we can't attack um so there's been really fun situations like that where it's like ah we failed this raid but at least we're having a good time so i'm still fun it's fun to fail still you know i mean it will probably not be fun to fail four months from now but it is still it's still fun now the other thing i didn't even think about is like i get to i get i like i got to a zapdos and i'm like i guess i can catch it but what i have i have 20 zapdos and i have four shiny zapdos and pokemon go i i should actually just like i don't need to be shiny i just think like yeah well that's an interesting like called you just the ones that you don't want shiny you just catch them and pull them out of your rotation i guess it pulls it out of your rotation right but you if you're joining other people it doesn't pull it out of there so that's like the weird thing i'm thinking of of like for me i guess i if i am going to shiny hunt i'm going to shiny hunt the few that i don't have like i have gosh because of pokemon go and because of let's go and because of sun and moon i have so many of these legends shiny like i have every shiny ultra beast except for buzzwall and cortana because i was too lazy to switch to the other version of the game yeah i i am all about shiny hunty shiny hunting ultra beasts yeah but it's like i have i have three four of the mole traces the zapdos the articunos from let's go and from pokemon go and it's like i have all of these shinies so there's only very few i don't have like i i don't have landorus i don't have thunderous and tornados and i don't have the lake spirits and that's kind of it and then i'm i'm thinking like what am i going to do for reggie drago and reggie cash register and i'm i'm probably just going to catch them because it to me it feels weird of having only one registered in my pokedex and that one being shiny so i guess i catch it and then if i do decide i want to shiny on it which by the way the the new reggies are not in dynamics adventure none of the reggies are indicted max adventure they have they're one of the four different story lines you can do one of them is kayla rex one of them is the reggie's one of them is the gallerian birds which is kind of confusing the gallerian birds are out in the world but the regular kintonian birds are in dynamics adventure yeah all the reggie's are out of dynamics adventure yeah so i if i'm going to decide to shiny hunt the reggie's i'll wait to a second copy because i do want a regular of the new reggie do we know if the hershey foods are actually in the dynamics they're not there's no hershey foods um there is uh there is type null and uh savalai the hershey foods cosmo cosmo these are legendary pokemon that do not appear in the dynamics adventure um lunala and solgaleo do their version exclusive i've heard uh zygarde is the biggest nightmare in the entire world i've heard that too because of power construct so very happy i'm sitting on three toothpaste zygardes from gamestop because that will be one pokemon i will catch right away i've heard just nightmares of people failing zygarde over and over again can i get my minor complaints out of the way yeah wait wait wait let one more okay before i promise this is super quick for the unova fans if you get your keurum and your zekrom and your restaurant and you're like i want to mix up the dna of these dudes where do i get my dna splicers you go up to stow inside the dude who sells you the cracked pots and the chipped pots he will hand you a dna splicer and a life do all right greg all yours okay one doesn't appear in why come and it's not very clear how to join somebody else's uh layer rates yeah can you explain okay i wanna i wanna join greg's raid how do i do it where do i go okay so first i will set a link code and then when through somehow some means outside of the game confirm that everybody is in front of the scientist in the layer ready to go then i will put in my code and say invite others then you the person that wants to join mine puts in the exact same code and then says invite others and what it does is everybody who has the same code ends up together which since humans are still bad at numbers means that sometimes multiple people since there's millions of playing have picked the same code as you no no no you always just start with zero because all the lazy people start with one because it's the first one you gotta work you gotta go down to zero you gotta put the person that started with seven multiple times and still had people jump into other people's raids there's a million people playing in a million combinations have never had a random join my raid well i always start i always started with zero i never started with one because zero is so far out of the way i have never started with one either i have started way down below just like you can't start with sevens people like seven lucky seven people people who are people who are now listening to this program are gonna start doing zeros because of you so stuff that let me tell you my second best number so so stuff it you're it's gonna happen because there's so many people playing the game right now so you have to put in the same code and hit invite others and then verify outside okay are you making all eight digits unique yes are you doing like seven zero zero seven seven zero zero my digits are unique and it happened don't don't even try that garbage with me steve i know what i'm talking about it is still are you doing 4 24 26 i'm doing six nine six nine four yeah that's your problem six nine six nine no i'm not doing that i'm doing unique numbers and it still happens like it just happens but that whole process of getting everybody to join in two minute or is it three minute somewhere in their window is a bit of a nightmare um especially since people's outside names if you'll say in slack and their in-game names don't match and you're like is this you or who are you so the fact that that process also isn't explained anywhere in the game it's just like i don't know is this how we do it and then eventually it works but you have to everybody has to put in the same code and hit invite others and you all should pop into the same raid together that process is a bit of a nightmare i am not a fan minor complaint two is since you don't know if it's going to be shiny at the end it makes your choice of pokeball through the gameplay more difficult because if you really want a shiny uh jigglypuff in a friend ball you can send that friend ball out and if that jiggly puff is shiny isn't shiny you've wasted that ball because you don't get the balls that you used on the other three pokemon back they are gone so you sort of have to decide is what balls am i going to use am i going to be happy having this shiny in this ball that i don't want it in or am i willing to constantly take the risk of i'm going to use my friend ball on this legendary and hope that it's shiny i've only got 10 shots at this the fact that those balls are wasted is a minor complaint it's a little bit frustrating because for people who really want to use the apricorn balls and those are already hard to get it's a hard it's a hard decision to make do i waste it not knowing if it's going to be shiny if you really want to shine an apricorn ball you have other ways to do it you do you absolutely do but it is like i said it's a minor complaint about about this that you that even in the raid itself you don't know until the entire thing is over and then it determines shiny and so i'm just throwing everything in luxury balls i have 999 of them and i like luxury balls so that's not a huge decision for me but for other people it is like well i really want wanted in this am i going to use this ball now on on the one in 100 chance that it's shiny and in the ball that i want yeah that's just the fact that you don't get those balls back after you've caught them because you can only pick one is my only is it it's again it's a minor complaint it's it's up there with the fact that i just really want a way to swap a ball in game i want to be able to put my star there's a game into the electric ball factory that they never took advantage right like that would just fix that problem like and that's just like those are my two minor complaints it's a little frustrating there's no there's no in-game way to communicate with other people so you do have to rely outside the game which i tend to not like and your ball choices are use it and lose it if you don't pick that pokemon because it is a guaranteed catch rate so it's very tempting to use these balls but you don't know if they're shining until the end so it can come across as i use this ball and you know i've just lost my last moon ball because it wasn't shiny so just know that going in that you if you use that ball to catch that pokemon and you don't take it you lose that pokeball no matter what it is it doesn't come back worst case scenario if you really wanted hidden ability cr brawlers not of the game if you hidden ability uh machoke and you used your moon ball worst case scenario is you can always take it to the daycare and breed the moon ball down yeah so it's not a complete waste but yeah i get what you're saying yeah but on legendaries you you know it's a use it lose it and hope that it's shiny because you don't get to see in the actual raids and yeah again like those are the two things that i'm like i think that's the i think that's the good trade-off that they've yeah they've done there they they've they've given you an increased shiny chance right and the trade-off is it's kind of like i think of it like like wormhole or like chain fishing i remember i'm sure this is going to happen once monday comes because the thing came out over a weekend but i'm sure you're going to see like oh my gosh shiny hunting's so broken and it made it so easy which is funny because like six months ago people were complaining that it was not hard it was too hard or not fair or whatever there's like a limit to that right so this is the same thing that happened with chain fishing people were like oh it's so broken it's easy shinies but there's only so many fish in x and y that you could have chain fished for right and then each route had like three different fish and then you were like wow cool i got all three fish it was really hard it was like sixty percent magikarp thirty percent bar boats ten percent goldie and i got that ten percent goldeen and you're like wow i love chain fishing and then you go to another route and you're like okay well this one also has magikarp but it has like sidra and quill fish and then you like get all those three and you might have gotten like a couple extra magikarp and then you go to another route and you're like all right well this one has golden and magikarp and cdra i like like you there's a there was a limit to that right and and there was a limit to wormholes and the same thing happened people were like oh wormhole is broken so easy shiny they're just handing them out like candy my grandma has 17 shinies because of it and she's only played 10 minutes but once you get like 15 of the 20 shinies it was really hard to get the last five because you had no control you could control the wormhole you went into but then it rolled between the five pokemon and it's like well i was missing ian mega in the red one and oh i got altaria not yamaga so it did get harder and i can't imagine i'm sure there are people that are like oh my gosh i'm gonna get shiny after shiny after shiny yeah maybe i mean it's 100 it's really really good uh for 20 minutes of your time but you don't like if if if you see a cramer ant and your group doesn't decide to go that route well now you just missed out the cramer ant and now you're fighting another rhyhorn or something um like there is no control like if you were thinking yeah i'm going to get shiny jigglypuff by doing dynamics adventure i i haven't even seen jigglypuff yet like i've seen exeggutor like three times if you were that person that specifically wants to shiny hunt a pro pokemon you're probably better off for your time to do that outside of dynamax adventure whether that is masuda or whether that's overworld encounter because you know at the end of that you're guaranteed that whether it takes ten minutes or two weeks i did eight hours of dynamics adventure and i saw executor three times i saw jigglypuff zero times so there that you're trading off control for luck i guess is is what the pokemon company has seem to be doing in in these one-off shiny methods that they keep for a game and not also let me interject um do not dynamics adventure for hidden ability pokemon the ability patch exists oh my gosh it's so expensive dynamics so expensive that's fine still if that is what like the one thing that you're looking for it's cheaper than a beast ball yeah no no no no no beast ball is 150. 200. oh i guess i misread it i've done eight nine 10 hours of dynamics adventure i think i just hit 200 yeah it's a lot which is fine yeah it's i mean it's fine i i mean i'm sure in a future game it'll be what was it like bottle caps are really expensive right and then alpha sun and moon they got like a little cheaper and in this game you just find them on the ground right yeah people are just tossing them out there you go for you mints at the beginning of this game were were impossible and now there's like islands that just generate them every day and they appear randomly throughout crown tundra too yeah i've read across them like oh what okay and i'm sure if there's another pokemon game they'll take it all away from us again of course but did you just say if there's another pokemon game you know if the small indie company can you know survive scrape up enough dollars to put out a new game all right we have more to talk about for the crown thunder but we also have a little bit of news we need to tackle we're going to take a quick break and we'll be right back and then like when you go into a max parade and then like when you go into a max raid is we are back from our break all right we'll get back to crown tundra here in a bit let's get through some

next here's a champion doing stuff next this off pokemon.com as well celebrate halloween with mega gengar in pokemon go raids if you are taking if you're if you're dreaming of taking on a raid boss with mega gengar and your party i'm sure thousands of people are dreaming that your days of pinning will soon be over painting pining uh to celebrate the spookiest holiday of the year the shadow pokemon is mega evolution will feature mega raids will be featured in mega raids on october 23rd replacing mega venusaur always the the kanto starter that is out i suppose since gengar is ghost and poison team up with ground psychic ghost dark type attacks uh mega gengar is just a few of the many halloween themed activities taking place in pokemon go this year uh there's no end date here i would imagine november 1st yeah probably this actually brings us into some more pokemon go news first bit being that latin america will get their own unique event i'm very excited to hear people complain about this why are they complaining about it because they don't because pokemon go fans are selfish and they want all the events for themselves oh uh this year uh this year's spirits will return in the end in our annual halloween event in pokemon go we will be celebrating the day of the dead for the first time in a special event for trainers in latin america the day of the dead is a holiday observed in mexico and other parts of america that celebrate the lives and memory of family and friends who are no longer with us in mexican tradition it is said that the spirits of the deceased return to the world of the living during this special time to share a joyful celebration with the ones celebration with their loved ones surrounded by candles flowers fruit bread sugar skulls incense and other traditional foods and decorations so on sunday november 1st to monday november 2nd they will have pokemon representing different elements of the day of the dead including cubone sunflora rosalia cacnia duskel and litwick appearing more frequently in the wild the following pokemon are will be attracted to incense gasly mysterious absol shepard duskul drifloon and litwick and there will be field research for those players including pokemon that will be marowak alolan marowak murkrow and duskel those will all be shiny um when and may all be shiny they're not all guaranteed shiny when sharing pandemiro met merito murica panda muerto with family dead bread dead bread with family and friends don't forget to battle together poffins will be available as a special reward for go battling check the shop for a special box featuring puffins star pieces and raid passes and there will be surprises for the snapshot and that's it it sounds like fun i wish it was here too because i like all the pokemon that are showing up but it's cool yeah i wonder if they'll do more specific events i'm assuming this is kind of the start right there are probably plenty of things that americans don't celebrate that others do i am a little confused so is this for all of south america though it doesn't specifically say mexico and other parts of the america celebrate it but then it depends on what they define as latin america yeah yeah and like as far as i'm aware like day of the dead is like a mexican tradition it is not a brazilian it's not an argentinian it's like a mexican tradition so that's where i was like why why would they have it in these other places yeah it depends on what they consider like what their latin american region is i don't know how how far that extends or where they also say that latin america is supposed to get corsola and it's still appearing in texas and florida i don't know how they like limit it yeah i don't know does it is it based off your profile you set is it based off of your location i don't know how they roll this out it's cool though it sounds cool sounds like a cool event yeah i mean anytime rosetti appears more often i'm into it ah there is some uh november news here for pokemon go off pokemon go live.com november's research breakthrough encounter will be togetic the happiness pokemon from november 1st through december 1st i'm a s i'm assuming because of go battle league like tokyo kiss is really good in go battle badly that's probably why would be my guess in uh insert remember when legendaries were in breakthrough encounters yeah that was like well over a year ago why give it up buddy that ship has sailed i mean the ship may come back yeah like true true it's just on a long voyage away from you right now it's got a world to circumnavigate friday the 23rd of october through november 5th dar cry has returned the mythical pokemon cry november 5th through the 16th a familiar pokemon will return they do not they're all familiar well i'm just default lugia i don't know cresselia we just had chrysalia we just had crescelia i mean it's so weird that they just call it a familiar pokemon do you name it what's it like it's another eevee what's up what's up what is that what appears in november it's ho oh it's actually the only thing i know it's not going to be is palkia dialga it's it's moltres it's a bird on fire for thanksgivings i just did bolt race so it's a familiar pokemon it's it's pikachu yeah the most familiar pikachu wearing a pokey outfit it's pikachu wearing a pilgrim hat from the 16th through the 27th turakian kobelian and verizean i had to look up all these names so i'm saying them right uh we'll be in five star raids they all end in the end that's how you remember though tarakian kobelian i didn't believe it was verizon but it is verizon like verizon wireless verizon it's just weird that they didn't keep they didn't make him ion yeah i don't know language barriers make it easy to say for everyone i don't know i mean it's lion ion i mean we do not know what the raid boss will be for november 24th through the 30th but that will be a set period of time where a raid boss will appear spotlight hours uh on tuesday november 3rd cubone will appear uh double the starvest november 10th jigglypuff will appear double the xp november 17th meowth will appear because we haven't gotten enough meowth in the last like year meowth will appear twice the candy again i guess on november 24th everyone's favorite bar boats will appear with twice the candy for transferring save your transfers for that i guess i mean i am so i'm at the very limit for storage because i keep waiting for this go integration mm-hmm end of the year uh they need to hurry because december 31st is what i know wasn't that when pokemon bank came out it came out like the 30th of december well it came out yeah i felt like it came out real late other thing to take note here is that uh they did an egg rotation so all the eggs are different except for the 12ks obviously those just rolled out so they have no reason to change it we don't have to go through the entire egg rotation rotation here but if you want to see what's in eggs i made a graphic that's on the twitter twitter.com pkmencast and on instagram uh pkmencast there are two of everything currently in the new egg rotations so if you're curious of if if you're looking for a specific pokemon and you're curious of where they are that'll help you i hope uh last thing here with pokemon go before we move on is that uh in celebration of the crown tundra ponyta and surface were in pokemon go for a good 24 hours that was a real fast event yep they made gallerian firefetch spawn everywhere there's now a way to evolve it into surfetch you have to set farfetch as your butty and then as farfetch is your buddy you have to get 10 excellent throws not in a row just 10 excellent throws and then you will have the option to evolve which is actually really a cool way to do it and i kind of hope they do more of that in the future so when was that event that was the day the crown thunder came out yep so i'm glad that i got the news alert in pokemon go informing me of that event this morning they're either too early or too late you can't win the other thing is they added gallerian ponyta during this event in raids um and now that the event is over they put both gallery and ponyta and farfetch into 7k eggs so you can still get them if you like to hatch 7k eggs which everyone i don't us and uh the pokemon masters uh crown tundra event was uh nothing there was one no they did something interesting i don't i don't i understand what happened here uh like it's no surprise at this point that they've been doing pokemon go events to correspond with the anime or the core games or whatever pokemon masters did a pile of armor thing they acknowledged it they said i love armors here in the game they just didn't do it to be fair they're in the middle of their halloween event so they may not have wanted to because pokemon masters has never overlapped 18 of them oh i know i'm look i'm just trying to be nice for once in my life i mean there's already we don't have to we don't have time to talk about their the overall fan base with masters has been pretty unhappy since the anniversary event has ended and now the fact that they missed the release they didn't do anything for this release not even just acknowledge it seems worrisome in my opinion why well they acknowledge why because because at one point i would are because at one point i would say that it was very cool when it was pokemon day the pokemon company sent out an email they acknowledged pokemon go sword and shield and masters pokemon duel never got that treatment cafe mix i don't think was around at the time um you know other things in the pokemon franchise have never gotten that treatment the only thing outside of the main series games that god acknowledged was pokemon go because of how big it is but for masters to be on that like pedestal of like oh cool they're acknowledging masters masters is doing something for the what when is the pokemon's birthday 24th of february 27th of february it was cool and then crown tundra came out or sorry isle of armor came out and masters acknowledged that that was really cool because again symmetry every they're all all their pillars are doing the same thing they're all acknowledging these big events together and now crown tundra is here pokemon go acknowledged it but masters did not so i mean what's your worry though like that masters is my worry is just that that i that i don't know like i don't i don't know what is happening there but i i do know that people are people are not happy with masters right now and they skip this event and we don't know what's planned for our uh november for masters so they've made something they may do something crown tundra after halloween yeah just give them some space give them some breathing room i mean they may so i feel like if you're coming off a one-year anniversary event you you you don't you don't lose all that momentum you gotta keep that momentum going right because players came back because of the one year anniversary yeah i mean but i don't think they've lost the momentum i think they've had very specific events for their game like they are in the middle of a big halloween event they may have like i i don't know what they would do for crown tundra that couldn't wait until november and and maybe they learned that players actually don't like overlapping events so i would say most players are saying that there's nothing to do with masters right now that's not good log in every day for free gems okay how many free gems are we actually like that used to be a thing uh now it's login for skip tickets that you can't really use yeah i mean i think that i think what's driving people away from masters isn't that there isn't new content it's that they had a really good thing going with the stamina that felt like it wasn't overpowering but also gave you things to do and now some of us are sitting on twelve hundred skip tickets and you can get and you get one 200 stamina update a day which which is 10 skip tickets which is 10 skip tickets it's just not enough and the events are good but since they raised the cap to 125 and they raised the 6ex problem um some of those trick-or-treat boss battles are not fun if you haven't spent all of your time trying to get them up to 125. like they can be a very frustrating set of circumstances uh especially if you've been unlucky in polls i think there's just sort of a combination of the getcha thing the stamina being unbalanced that the current events in the game aren't aren't enough for you to spend out all of your stamina knowing that you won't get it back fast enough i i i don't think that's a hint that they've lost faith in the game i think that's a no i don't i don't think that like i don't think that masters is folding next week or anything but i do understand like deadlines right like if they're if they're in some sort of transitional period where they're trying to gear they're trying to shift gears into hey we want to make the game better hey we've been really silent for a while and they have been pretty silent um with communication that we're working on all this thing all these things because we know fans are not a hundred percent happy and because of that we just haven't had time and we missed the boat on approving everything to coincide with crown tundra i can totally see that happening that's probably maybe what did happen is like they're trying to make sure that they're launching my fingers across that they're launching something to alleviate a lot of the problems that people are expressing so going into november december people are are positive about masters again yeah uh there's no shortage of gotcha games that people seem to love i'm looking at you gentian impact gadget impact i have avoided because every every aspect and everybody who's played it says that it eats their life and i'm like look i got final fantasy 14 which has an incredible patch out right now and crown tundra which is also an incredible patch right now i do not need to add this game to my life plus i started playing among us there are things happening i am swamped plus you know job uh and i have a job whoa you guys have jobs yeah it's nice we get money you should try it what is money yeah i hope next time we uh podcast or something there's more to talk about in regards to masters i feel like right now there's nothing we're just kind of waiting yeah i mean we already talked about the halloween event so yeah there i mean until something new happens like if they're going to do thanksgiving with i don't know something something multitrace it's going to be ethan and multrace ethan in a sigma suit pilgrim outfit with moltres this is pokemon.com this is there are some more champions path uh coming champions path premium collection marnie which would which launched on friday the same day that crown tundra came out it's almost like we just talked about how pokemon likes to line up everything at the same time if you like marnie there is a foil card featuring grim snarl v foil card featuring more pico v two two pins in this set a more pico pin and a grim snarl pin uh you also get a play mat featuring marnie with her favorite pokemon partners it comes with eight booster packs of champions path and um this was on pokemon center it sold out uh no surprise that people like marnie and uh it came with a play mat which is cool i like the fact that the headline on the main pages get grim and hangry in the pokemon tcg i hate that uh i don't i'm i'm assuming these would be like targeting walmart and stuff uh but champions path has been so hard to find that good luck if you find it probably pick it up the other thing that came out is there was the same day october 23rd there was a uh champions path collection hatareen v this features uh one foil card of hatchery and v the oversized foil card of hatchery and v four tcg booster packs of champions path and a code card and that is um that was also sold out uh on pokemon center pokemon center did restock base set or or elite trainer box of champions path uh i did tweet that um it did sell out uh in like six or seven hours so it didn't sell out completely but as as of this recording it is sold out now so if you're still trying to get champions path it is uh it's rough out there did we talk about the pokemon center hoodies we didn't i was going to transition into there is a ball guy plush on pokemon yeah um that is yeah there is 20 20 bucks the ball get your ball guy is he wearing the like the original yep okay there's a lot of stuff on pokemon center um they put they added hershey food plushes kub foo plushes gallerian slowpoke plushes they re re-added uh for those that don't know there's what's called a classic collection on pokemon center which is normally like suits or or ties and dress dress socks and tie bars and handkerchiefs they just added more of that it's a lot of charizard stuff you want charizard socks charizard bow tie charizard handkerchief i'm sorry this ball guy doll is horrifying it is i kind of want it oh they added it out cremi plush they added uh overpriced jewelry and charms that you can get they added charmander holiday lights pokemon plush it is unfortunately very cute they added uh four four or five hoodies they added a um same uh they added four five beautiful halloween hoodies banette sableye mimikyu gengar and everyone's spookiest pokemon lucario uh all fit into the one is not like the other here so i hate hoodies what is wrong with you get out of my life we know this about me how are we friends greg because i tolerate your presence but this save alive thing is making me rethink my entire hoodie stance because i love it very much hoodies are nice around the house it's a little chilly throw on a hoodie i hate having the thing hanging off the back of my neck and when i sit down i have something between me and the chair that's not all the way on my back it's halfway down my back are you doing this annoying sit different you uh you understand that i'm a gay man and we do not sit in chairs right as a rule you know this don't stereotype it is not a stereotype when everybody does it the problem is that i know i'm a pass on these hoodies i don't need extra attachments ears tails etc none not yet well when the event happens where i do need them i'll be sure to let everyone know okay maybe you sold out lucario sold out of course the lucario sold out not sold out of course no one likes banette is so cool he has zippers yeah but the hoodie does not i mean it has one yeah yeah i mean it has one zipper uh and what's getting set us on gengar gengar's hold up now pass uh thanks to brandon for sending in the ball guys stuff from our slack community by the way just trying to give credit did you did you get the email where they had the animated dancing ball guy i probably got that evil well it was horrifying little long week with the uh with the the dlc dropping and twitch changing their rules and me panicking and it's been a heck of a week pokemon home got updated should we talk about this is there much to talk about no i mean everything got updated everything got updated to take crown tundra stuff yeah was there anything more special than that no i don't think so they added a small thing to home i mean at this point it's still hard to recommend home to somebody who yeah what small thing did they add okay uh so they added compatibility with the crown tundra part two of the sword and shields expansion pass they added a save feature for search and sorting settings in the pokemon boxes that was big well not big but something they added a new category for popular pokemon to the trade ranking so that's where you can search of like what's being requested the most what's not and they uh fix some other issues to ensure a user-friendly experience i don't know that i don't know what that means but we're at version 1.3 now still can i guess confidently say that home has been updated more than bank has in the first year that bank was in seven years so i has that going for it um there is still no transferring to pokemon go yet and we still don't know what that i mean i don't think from from pokemon go i don't know if any of us expected that this weekend no but it would be nice already enough to do what i have learned this past week is that i could easily spot any american in my twitch chat because they don't know how time zones work and they don't know that there are other countries in other time zones of all weekend being like when is the dlc when is the dlc oh that that's like uh yeah in in in my twitter and they were like when is the deals i thought the dlc was coming out on thursday i said yeah 9 p.m pacific and they said well that's friday and i'm like what how east coast centric art because it's midnight on the east coast yeah but the rest of the country is still in thursday buddy well yeah so this was the thing i i had to continue to point out to people so in the on the japanese pokemon website and on the in the japanese youtube video that announced the crown tundra it said friday the 23rd and then on the english youtube and on the english pokemon website it said the thursday the 22nd most people i i i'll give our podcast listeners credit because most of them are adults that can probably function in this world unlike twitch chat which is out of control um but we understand that japan is in the future right they're like 12 hours ahead of us so yes they are in the future the future is also now yes i can call the future right now i can call them and say what's tomorrow like please tell me so we're recording this podcast at 3 p.m on sunday it is technically monday in japan right now as we're recording this so this makes sense now i'm going to make this a little complicated that makes sense i'm going to make i'm going to make this a little complicated there was a third trailer for europe the uk trailer and the europe trailer said that it comes out on friday the 23rd so we have the uk uh or europe and japan saying friday and the us sang the 22nd so no the pokemon company game freak niantic whoever you want to blame did not lie to you i had plenty of that of like they lied to us they said it was going to come out on thursday it is still thursday buddy it is 8 p.m thursday we're still in thursday but anyways if we take the time zones from the uk and japan and we crossed that over with the us time zones there was like a six hour window where the game could have came out which was anywhere between 6 p.m central time and and midnight central time which is 4 to 10 pacific and 7 to 1 a.m eastern so that was the window that everything kind of overlapped and i think the dlc dropped around 8pm which was the same time ponyta and farfetch dropped in pokemon go and home went down for maintenance and everything so it did come out on thursday it was no lying i there's like this gamer mentality where like oh most games come out midnight so gamefreak lied to me because it didn't come out at midnight i want to remind you that the isle of armor came out at like 10 a.m or something like that uh so no game freak did not lie it did come out on thursday in america it came out on friday in the uk came out friday of japan all at the same time worldwide release it was just funny because i could tell that the person complaining that game free glide or it's not out yet was definitely american but did anybody tell japan about time you know that's a good question i still don't i guess the reason they probably didn't solidify the time this is my only maybe justification is because they didn't they had to line it up with pokemon go and so if pokemon go wasn't ready and they released it because they have they wanted ponyta and surface to come out and it all came out at the same time so but i don't get nintendo this is not a game freak or pokemon company this is a nintendo thing nintendo is also this company that doesn't tell you when the smash update is coming out i think smash players just expect it at like 8 pm central time at this point but how many updates have smash brothers have gotten seven eight yeah and yeah all of these updates they have never given a time when it comes out so it keeps it exciting mm-hmm is that is that what we're taking for excitement apple used to do the same thing dude yeah that's true but now apple will tell you when you can pre-order when it will ship you know what they used to do this is it funny how my co-workers are just like your twitch stream where apple tells you when you can pre-order and when it's actually available and the day of the apple announcements they're calling you up and saying please order me this phone i'm like it doesn't literally doesn't exist not a thing yet oh believe me as a person who has to deal with it we are well aware of those dates well that was all the news i have uh going back to crown tundra just a little bit more before we wrap up the show here i'm assuming neither of you guys did the star tournament the updated nah i haven't gotten that yet i i heard that the first i i haven't done it yet either because i've been stuck in raids um i've heard the first time it's pretty easy but once you beat it it increases the difficulty um but there is still no level scaling uh and i think what game had level was that emerald where like no matter what you brought in it scaled yeah um so people ratio is emerald people were a little bummed out that i heard the dialogue for the um star stuff is good so next week we can talk a little bit more i mean that's that's at the rose stadium right yeah it's at the rose stadium look that's old galler i'm in new galler all galleries dead to me i mean i do like that they're like applying the update to old galler like when i did my daily still on side task and the dude's like here's a dna splicer i was like oh how charming and sweet i think he was not expecting this is that the guy that says i guess all the time yes come back tomorrow if you might have something you want i guess can they program in a little bit of enthusiasm in the in the next patch there there is we talked about this last week where we were hoping that there was going to be some surprise of uh you know well it depends on what you want as a surprise right for me having a dude in the in the rose tower letting me use a a pokemon i caught in black and white in competitive ranked was a huge surprise that they didn't talk about there is a surprise in this game but it's way too spoilery for us to talk about this episode so we'll save it for next episode but um uh it has to do with the main calarex storyline so yeah i think that was yep i think it was a good surprise obviously is it gonna make me happy or sad yes okay yes pokemon return following you yep it is still weird that they just don't apply that to the current wild area yeah that would be a very free that would be a very nice free update that they could do but yeah take a piece of advice from me if if you want creepy you're playing on halloween you want creepy vibes you own a bilacephalon makeup lecephalon come on in your party and walk around in the over world oh it just oh it's so freaky no no no it's great if you can't handle super freaky uh now lego will also give you a nice disturbing maybe not as creepy vibe i already have a problem with talonflame being angry when i stop isn't that great it's just like sister just like can't move on i want to fly i was personally disappointed no new ribbons for me i like collecting ribbons no new ribbons unfortunately but you can mark hunt for the galler birds the glarion articuno zapdos small trays they can have a mark on them which is not a ribbon but appears in the ribbon tab so good enough for me uh those those three pokemon are shiny locked so you can't get them shiny anyways uh but you can mark hunt them so that's exciting uh and i think is that your next hunt are you gonna hunt oh marks yeah i'm definitely gonna mark hunt those personality or higher uh so i don't want weather and i don't want um there's rankings of markings the like the uncommon mark is like the most common and then there's like the weather and then there's like time of day that would be like morning or or whatever dosy um and then there's personality so and then and the only thing higher than personality is the rare mark which is a one in a thousand chance which is three and one in 333 if with the mark charm so i will mark up those i think everyone who's encountered the birds are happy with how they did it uh i think the common theme here is in in in past and i'm trying not to be a spoiler i think people people were definitely really disappointed in x and y with how they handled zygarde with how they handled mewtwo they just kind of plopped them in a cave and overall kind of since x and y maybe even like black and white i would say most people have kind of been disappointed that legendary encounters don't feel legendary i wouldn't say that dynamaxx adventure makes legendary pokemon feel legendary although they are fun but i think they did the regis here and how they did the birds i think answered those issues that people had i think we can go more in depth than that next week yeah i haven't pursued those paths yet there are there's a diglett equivalent in this game you guys have seen that i have i think it's okay we talk about this uh the swords of justice are in the game they are not in dynamics adventure they are in the crown tundra you have to find their footprints to make them spawn the only one that i'm confused about as to where to go next is parisian i think once they spawn they stand there they don't like i think so run around and i believe they stand there but like finding the truth i i'm i know where to find the tracks for the other two but like after my initial attempt i'm like and i'm out of the these tracks and i don't know where to go so because it's the task that sonia gives you yes yes oh man i thought that was the legendary birds all right i think for the birds you just go to the tree you just go to the tree yeah so there there are four there are four legendary things one is sonia with the musketeers one is the birds at the tree one is calorics and then the last one is the regies so that is the i guess the they're all legendary and they're all the story of this game which the crown if if the olive armor was very battle heavy which it was move tudors dojo uh urshi fu being extremely competitive and annoying in in ranked battles um this is all about legendaries i think when when people i i would i would probably say if anyone is like i like the crown tundra better probably because they don't care about competitive which is fine like that is totally okay right you don't have to like every aspect of pokemon in order to like pokemon but there's no denying that the olive armor was built around mints and and uh move tutors and vitamins and ev training and even you know restrictive sparring really taught you that you should ev train to be competitive yep you need to collect 50 tracks for each so that good old 150 number uh but there are more than 50 tracks so there are if that you you don't have to be precise it's not like diglett where you're going to spend two hours looking for one diglett there are more than 50 um so just keep that in mind only other thing i think we can maybe talk about is that there is kind of a disappointing reward for completing your pokedex this time around uh for completing your pokedex in the crown tundra or sorry in the isle of armor you got the marked charm which i guess maybe some people wouldn't care about i i did i definitely did uh you got the mark charm you got a crown you got your certificate in this you do get a clothing item i don't want to spoil it uh but there's no charm uh you get three golden bottle caps 50 rare candy the certificate and a clothing item that i will not spoil so that's all you get for completing your pokedex what other charm would they have though uh yeah i don't know um hit i mean the only gonna give i would say hidden charm but you can only get hidden in raids and that wouldn't apply we're hitting ability well the game training time charm at the beginning of the crown tundra or at the isle of armor remember they give you that free get bonus experience maybe like a catch charm that makes catching even easier but you get that you get that already you get that critical account yeah the critical catch charm from the main story yeah well like a super critical catch charm okay so uh the the last thing i want to talk about because yeah the catch it's been a long time since we had to catch a legendary pokemon yeah this is not a spoiler you do catch calorics at one point i think this is obvious is that a spoiler that the legendary pokemon presented that's like saying hey zamasu and zashian on the cover of these games you get to catch those dudes catch those it is so frustrating to me that they they spent a dlc dedicated to competitiveness they gave you a better way to get vitamins they gave you the move tutors they introduced your shifu they got bottle caps and gold and bottle caps all that stuff and yet not every pokemon you want to catch should have perfect ivs which is weird to say and i'll explain there are certain pokemon in the game that that slower is better and it's not a and one of the reasons would be trick room trick room in competitive reverses the turn order so um a slower pokemon goes first a faster pokemon goes last and that is based off the speed stat but there is also things that are based off of um there are moves that use the speed stat or there's moves that use the attack stat or like um foul play it does more damage depending on how high the opponent's attack stat is you know if you're running a gengar who is a special attacker you probably don't want to have a high attack stat because you're weak to foul play um so it's not specifically speed but if if for whatever reason not spoilers aside i want a very slow calorics because i want to use calorics in trick room people know what i'm talking about i'm just trying to beat around the bush here but i have no way of getting a slow speed calorics without soft resetting which i think we've established at this point in the games that game freak doesn't want us to suffer set anymore right i think they locked the starters they lock type no they like sashi and zamasena they locked all of these right even the regis if you wanted to shiny out the regis you can actually just defeat them and lo and behold they respawn again and or you could run away and lo and behold they're still there um which is what a lot of people liked about omega ruby alpha sapphire latios latias you could just run away i think running away or defeating uh is a better way to interact with your game than turning it on and turning it back off again uh and yet there they still have not solved this issue of if i am actually trying to be competitive and i do want to control certain stats i can always make stats better if i if i caught you know if by starter score bunny you know didn't have perfect ivs i can use a bottle cap i can use a golden bottle cap i can use a mint i have so much control the thing i cannot do is i cannot decrease a stat i and and if if if trick room or any other sort of game mode i need stats to be a certain point i have no control over that and so i am stuck with soft resetting because that is the only option you have given me game freak uh there's room service oh gosh okay i was going to say the same thing i'm going to put room service on this pokemon because i need it to hold a different item well that's your problem they clearly gave you room service so on top of that a catch rate of three which uh is is has been the catch rate for a long time legendary there there's uh each pokemon have different catch rates right the highest catch rate you can get is a pidgey which i think is 255. the lowest cash rate you can get is a mythical or a legendary pokemon like mewtwo um articuno zapdos you know these have a catch rates of three same in the ultra wormhole you know when you found guaranteed in the ultra wormhole also had to catch rate of three it's so many pokeballs to try to catch they hand you another master ball i am not going to waste my master ball on a static encounter because the second i do the second i do i'm gonna catch calorics in a master ball i'm gonna take two feet into an absol which is shiny and it's gonna use paris song and i'm gonna be like i don't have a master ball anymore and it doesn't mean i have a fundamental question that you probably can't answer because i i can't answer it how did i end up with five master balls you get one master ball in the story yeah you get another master ball in the uh isle of armor right they give you one yeah you get another master ball crown tundra yeah where did they be a master ball in the isle of armor did they know no not that i remember i i i think they did i have five i don't know how i got five you won the lotto i have not won the lotto did you did you get surprised traded a pokemon holding a master ball released that pokemon master ball didn't know that the pokemon was holding the master ball then automatically went inventory i mean that's possible that is possible i have six master balls but the only reason i have so many is because i sped run the game got the master ball didn't use it then gave it to a pokemon traded it to myself and then deleted the save to speedrun again so every time i sped run i saved the master ball for myself uh i will say that i since i had only spent 10 balls catching uh i think your argument is done void because it didn't take me that long so get better oh okay anyways i've in my 20 hours of the dlc experience three hours have been in front of calorics throwing from your balls resetting luxury balls and it only took me ten so hey luxury bomb premiere will have the same catcher yeah i'm just saying they do wait no they do they do they do yeah that's what i'm saying steve get better they have almost gotten to the point where they have eliminated software setting altogether in their games almost the only thing they need to do for competitive at this point is give me an npc give me an item let me zero out an iv stat whether that's attack special attack or speed like those are the three i you would never need to zero out i don't think defense or special that's not true um you would want to zero out defense if you were running is stupid dumb complicated like for for like a pokemon like i think celestia celestillo's like best attack is it's is celestial the right example or is it niley go anyways one of the altar beasts if you don't know how beast boos works beast boosts would boost their best stat so if uh ultra beast's best at was attacked was attack when you knock out a pokemon then the attack stat gets a boost whereas if the ultra beast's best set was defense if you not got a pokemon the pokemon will get a defense boost i think it is stack attacka where if you were to have zero its best attack is defense but if you were to zero out if it's out its defense but have a hindering nature on the defense you can actually push its attack to be higher than its defense so then when stack attacker defeats a pokemon instead of getting a defense boost it gets an attack boost so this isn't just like the zeroing out stats is is more so it is not only restricted to trick room there's many reasons why you wouldn't want to do it so that's like the last thing we need competitively is something to do that otherwise i'm stuck in front of calorics for two hours resetting and that's not fun because i could be playing dynamics adventure which is you could just be using room service no i'm not going to use room service well that's your problem then this is the item then your price for not doing what they give you is sitting in front of calories yeah two hours they gave you a solution you don't want to take room service is not good it's not good can we talk about one more thing uh yes all right this is a little spoilery nothing to do with the story what you're cutting to get this in and i'm not happy about it uh no question of the week this week right g we're running real late in time uh will give us our pokemon of the week so last week's pokemon of the week what did i have to say about that dude uh well greg you were there i was there greg and i were having lunch i got invited to a remote raid and somebody in indianapolis and i was like why did you bother to do a remote remote raid for that one uh it's a first level pokemon that likes to do building buildings and it shares its name with the as i called it non-held item that it holds yes because it's like right because farfetch has a leak yeah it's like why doesn't this dude have a plank all right who's that pokemon it's chat it's never chat except for the one time that it was it's timber timber you are correct because you were at the table i was so confused because i was like you want me to use a rewrote remote raid pass for a timber timber and did you use that remote pad you did i did and i didn't have a timber in my pokedex so you know it all worked out in the end what is uh oh wait timber uh the machamp there's not a lot machop wannabe yeah there's not a lot about it uh timber and machop are both fighting type pokemon with a base that total of 305 gender ratio is 75 male 25 female most commonly associated with construction sites in their respective regions they have guts as a possibility and they both reach their final evolution by having to trade evolve got a pretty good but not great shuffle leica all right you ready for this week born ready i can guarantee that no one is going to be able to get this one right without looking something up nobody's gonna be able to do it off the top of their head guaranteed here we go last night i was on a dynamax adventure with a buddy when one of the rental pokemon that is offered well it took me completely by surprise i thought it was a glitch someone had misspelled pukamuku or something no though it was a real pokemon from galler that i had just completely forgotten about i guess this pokemon falls into that class of pokemon where you expect them to be one type but they are actually something completely different this coming from someone who decided to play through the crown tundra with an all ultra beast team i am not talking pseudowudo level more of a consideration that the pokemon should be a water type when it is not in a way this week's pokemon is a cousin to stun fisk not glare in stunfisk though it shares typing with the original unova stun fisk the other factor i should point out and now more in common with galerin's sunfisk is be careful where you step accidentally stepping on one of these could be quite a shocking experience there you go if anybody remembers that this pokemon actually exists i i do i know i know what it is we're doing a giveaway uh speaking of sword and shield uh if you haven't picked up sword and shield or you maybe only have one version and you want the other version uh oh and or you are cheap and you're like if i won this giveaway it's a free easy christmas present to somebody
