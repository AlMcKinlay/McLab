thank goodness for Netflix what have you (4:11 - 4:16)
off topic real quick what are you (4:14 - 4:18)
watching on Netflix well I just finished (4:16 - 4:21)
watching the program that should not be (4:18 - 4:25)
spoken of boo shibushi Road no one the (4:21 - 4:27)
blue ocean the one about the teenagers (4:25 - 4:29)
it's so controversial but I also watched (4:27 - 4:31)
dear white people which was a really (4:29 - 4:33)
great series I recommend everybody watch (4:31 - 4:36)
that that pops up every time I turn on (4:33 - 4:39)
Netflix and I I'm looking forward to (4:36 - 4:41)
watching it but City so far I'm just (4:39 - 4:44)
coming to Netflix to rewatch Twin Peaks (4:41 - 4:47)
hmm Vaughn Twin Peaks I mean (4:44 - 4:52)
is net fleet is on Twin Peaks they got (4:47 - 4:55)
they can service up there Twin Peaks is (4:52 - 4:57)
definitely on Netflix and if you haven't (4:55 - 4:58)
watched Twin Peaks you should watch it (4:57 - 5:00)
because it's very strange and it's very (4:58 - 5:05)
good at its iconic and now yeah is the (5:00 - 5:07)
only person in this conversation he used (5:05 - 5:09)
to watch it you know on Wednesday nights (5:07 - 5:12)
every week when is it now isn't it like (5:09 - 5:14)
their exception I'm not interested in (5:12 - 5:17)
that the third season is starting next (5:14 - 5:18)
Sunday (5:17 - 5:21)
I feel like 25 years later I feel like I (5:18 - 5:23)
can't live up to the hype I feel like (5:21 - 5:26)
you can and I feel like Travis were here (5:23 - 5:28)
we would be sharing this excitement (5:26 - 5:30)
together well they're not leaves so (5:28 - 5:33)
Travis also you have to understand Steve (5:30 - 5:35)
Twin Peaks is not like the x-files Twin (5:33 - 5:38)
Peaks is like Days of Our Lives except (5:35 - 5:41)
with it's worse that it's it's (5:38 - 5:43)
incredible that because they arrabal (5:41 - 5:45)
played they played everybody to think (5:43 - 5:48)
that it was a soap opera and then they (5:45 - 5:51)
turned it into sci-fi and sanity and I'm (5:48 - 5:53)
out of it I'm not interested in this (5:51 - 5:55)
yeah I guarantee you would hate it Oh (5:53 - 5:57)
Steve definitely would but Steve's (5:55 - 5:59)
mostly wrong about most everything how (5:57 - 6:02)
could it be wrong about hating something (5:59 - 6:05)
I either later Mother's Day here's the (6:02 - 6:08)
thing I don't watch a lot of TV (6:05 - 6:12)
everything I do watch on TV is so (6:08 - 6:15)
watered down and pointless to watch (6:12 - 6:18)
anyways that it is just background noise (6:15 - 6:21)
for me is this your way of segwaying (6:18 - 6:23)
into Eurovision yeah that well that was (6:21 - 6:26)
disappointing ha ha ha how did you even (6:23 - 6:28)
watch that I don't know how people watch (6:26 - 6:30)
that AHS entry there's a there's a (6:28 - 6:32)
reddit there's a subreddit for your (6:30 - 6:35)
vision and then it had like links for (6:32 - 6:36)

also at the swimming game it's also a (7:53 - 7:59)
location in Brazil hmm it's also (7:56 - 8:01)

the bad guy from ghostbusters 2 you know (8:03 - 8:07)

Maggie's Pokemon her blue belly yeah (8:39 - 8:44)
that was my gosh water pokemon what's (8:41 - 8:47)
the significance of the word maybe it's (8:44 - 8:50)
a clue to Pokemon stars maybe Pokemon (8:47 - 8:54)
stars only Zuul if it's just an all (8:50 - 8:56)
water continent it's just water world (8:54 - 9:00)
that's it speaking of likes it does that (8:56 - 9:02)
an 80s movie why is everything 10 now (9:00 - 9:05)
enough water movie but they're like they (9:02 - 9:06)
heard Will Anderson say too much water (9:05 - 9:09)
one too many times (9:06 - 9:12)
will give them too much water all water (9:09 - 9:14)
only water (9:12 - 9:18)
man your shoes are jet skis next bit of (9:14 - 9:20)
news here is the Pokemon company (9:18 - 9:24)
international names wicked cool toys as (9:20 - 9:28)
master toys license II so the company is (9:24 - 9:31)
called wicked cool toys as the master (9:28 - 9:33)
toys licensee for the Pokemon brand (9:31 - 9:37)
starting July 2018 in addition to the (9:33 - 9:38)
announcement the Pokemon company has (9:37 - 9:42)
announced it has become a strategic (9:38 - 9:45)
investor but what does that mean this (9:42 - 9:48)
buzz words in wicked cool toys and will (9:45 - 9:50)
have a seat on the and the toy company's (9:48 - 9:53)
board of directors the full announcement (9:50 - 9:54)
details can be found in this press (9:53 - 9:57)
release can use that name one more time (9:54 - 10:01)
wicked cool toys it's great yeah I'm not (9:57 - 10:03)
familiar with that brand but I think (10:01 - 10:05)
strategic investor means that they have (10:03 - 10:08)
bought a sufficient portion of voting (10:05 - 10:11)
shares that they have a controlling (10:08 - 10:13)
interest in the company without having (10:11 - 10:14)
an ownership interest in the company (10:13 - 10:16)
right so ownership is when you have like (10:14 - 10:18)
over 50% of the shares and then (10:16 - 10:20)
basically you can make any decision you (10:18 - 10:23)
want because nobody can vote more than (10:20 - 10:25)
you but a controlling interest might be (10:23 - 10:28)
like you have 30% of the shares and (10:25 - 10:30)
somebody else has 30% of the shares so (10:28 - 10:31)
you guys have to like agree on things (10:30 - 10:33)
but you can't necessarily just make (10:31 - 10:34)
those decisions on your own (10:33 - 10:37)
that makes enormous strategic I feel (10:34 - 10:39)
like you could drop the word strategic (10:37 - 10:41)
though and just be investor that's (10:39 - 10:43)
curious to me though what they what (10:41 - 10:45)
they'll be doing what their plan is with (10:43 - 10:47)
that a little bit more of the press (10:45 - 10:48)
release just because this is kind of (10:47 - 10:50)
interesting I don't know if it states (10:48 - 10:53)
what what toys wicked-cool has actually (10:50 - 10:56)
made I actually just pulled it up and I (10:53 - 10:58)
can eat to you some of the brand's all (10:56 - 11:01)

strategic partnership with them through (11:35 - 11:39)
both collaboration and financial (11:37 - 11:42)
investment end quote and then it went on (11:39 - 11:46)
to say Tommy T oh my will continue to be (11:42 - 11:48)
a key licensing partner for the Pokemon (11:46 - 11:51)
brand and will produce select items as (11:48 - 11:53)

reminiscent of like hey uh we're pulling (12:09 - 12:15)

those the baby azules yeah the old bina (12:40 - 12:47)
boobies that was high okay it wasn't (12:44 - 12:51)
tell me I had the wrong company so it (12:47 - 12:55)
could also be that it's just that wicked (12:51 - 12:58)
cool toys does different things then (12:55 - 13:01)
Tomy does or Tommy I've always said Tomy (12:58 - 13:03)

they purchased I don't think that they (13:26 - 13:30)
originally made the Cabbage Patch Kids (13:28 - 13:33)
because I don't know make him out about (13:30 - 13:35)
if there was a company named wicked cool (13:33 - 13:37)
in the 80s they would not have been able (13:35 - 13:38)
to sell anything because somebody would (13:37 - 13:40)
have found that very evil (13:38 - 13:43)
well maybe in your company name wicked (13:40 - 13:47)

bread and butter so yeah yeah I I've (18:14 - 18:19)
been told the VGC game is good this year (18:16 - 18:21)
but I have not in that I've not watched (18:19 - 18:25)
many competitive players play but why (18:21 - 18:28)
that why there is such this this (18:25 - 18:30)
description of credit cards and money (18:28 - 18:33)
exchanging hands is because if you are (18:30 - 18:36)
competing in the master division so (18:33 - 18:39)
these are for like you 15 years old and (18:36 - 18:42)
up 16 years old them up both the pokemon (18:39 - 18:44)

of sleeves and either a play mat or a (19:01 - 19:08)
hat for 4 TCG players or a hat for VGC (19:04 - 19:10)
competitors this was never done in the (19:08 - 19:13)
past for my understanding and will you (19:10 - 19:16)
can correct me if I'm wrong but when I (19:13 - 19:20)
went to both VDC a and TCG competitions (19:16 - 19:23)
you don't get anything when I was when I (19:20 - 19:26)
wrecked when I incorrect when I first (19:23 - 19:27)
started going and you can correct me in (19:26 - 19:29)
a second it was free to play you just (19:27 - 19:32)
went in you played and then while you (19:29 - 19:35)
were playing they would hand out free (19:32 - 19:38)
prizes so just by playing it would be (19:35 - 19:41)
like Oh seat number 34 you get a play (19:38 - 19:43)
mat and it's like oh look I was sitting (19:41 - 19:46)
in seat 35 that sucks but okay cool that (19:43 - 19:48)
person just got a play mat then when (19:46 - 19:50)
they changed it to like $10 to play you (19:48 - 19:52)
still didn't get anything or at least I (19:50 - 19:54)
didn't and they still did the giveaway (19:52 - 19:58)
thing of like hey if table two seat one (19:54 - 20:00)
you get a free hat but maybe that was (19:58 - 20:03)
just the the how they coordinated those (20:00 - 20:07)
prizes slash gifts because clearly tcpi (20:03 - 20:09)
was sending them stuff to to do two (20:07 - 20:12)
giveaways slash do stuff with I mean (20:09 - 20:14)
yeah at local stuff but I was thinking (20:12 - 20:17)
about the old US Nationals we had a (20:14 - 20:20)
shirt you got a free t-shirt dude those (20:17 - 20:21)
things are sweet (20:20 - 20:25)
man you guys got t-shirts yeah the dot (20:21 - 20:27)
very well I got mediums instead of (20:25 - 20:29)
arches oops that was a thing with (20:27 - 20:32)
teetering is yeah they're cool but you (20:29 - 20:34)
almost never get your size because they (20:32 - 20:37)
only made 20 small for medium and then (20:34 - 20:42)
702 XL well know your market but I mean (20:37 - 20:44)
I could have asked for a large I just (20:42 - 20:46)
didn't there's a reminder of the (20:44 - 20:47)
citizens of the suburb (20:46 - 20:50)
Skinner goes all right all we got is (20:47 - 20:54)
extra small and extra large well we're (20:50 - 21:00)
out of extra small well no and we used (20:54 - 21:02)
to get the promo cards too yeah yeah I'm (21:00 - 21:04)
sure they're still doing promo cards (21:02 - 21:06)
that that is that's not discussed here (21:04 - 21:08)
like I feel like that's a given but (21:06 - 21:09)
you're getting a deck box which is great (21:08 - 21:12)
a set of sleeves which is great a play (21:09 - 21:15)
mat play mats are on what pokemon center (21:12 - 21:18)
comm they're like $35 yes sir (21:15 - 21:20)
and if you got like a Worlds play mat (21:18 - 21:24)
remember when so every worlds they would (21:20 - 21:27)
have a store at Worlds and it would be (21:24 - 21:30)
like an eight-hour line to get you would (21:27 - 21:33)
have to wait at like 2 a.m. to wait for (21:30 - 21:35)
it to open at 9:00 a.m. and then when (21:33 - 21:37)
you get in everything sold out anyways (21:35 - 21:39)
but they would help play mats for like (21:37 - 21:42)
$40 at Worlds and then they would appear (21:39 - 21:46)
on eBay moments later for like $300 this (21:42 - 21:48)
is not a lie so you would either wait 8 (21:46 - 21:50)
hours and still not get a play mat at (21:48 - 21:54)
Worlds or if you were like top 16 maybe (21:50 - 21:56)
top 32 you would get a play mat just for (21:54 - 21:59)
competing now it seems like everyone's (21:56 - 22:01)
getting a play mat for your $60 which i (21:59 - 22:04)
think is if you're competing at that (22:01 - 22:07)
high of a level $60 I feel like is (22:04 - 22:10)
nothing but you're also getting stuff (22:07 - 22:11)
too so even if you lose all your matches (22:10 - 22:13)
you're still walking away with what (22:11 - 22:16)
would Pokemon Center sell a $35 play mat (22:13 - 22:19)
they would sell you a deck box probably (22:16 - 22:22)
for $5.99 and they would sell you a set (22:19 - 22:25)
of card sleeves for you know $9.99 let (22:22 - 22:27)
me finish this real quick competitors (22:25 - 22:30)

need to register they will be given six (23:43 - 23:48)
booster packs upon entry now I'm just (23:45 - 23:50)
kidding they don't get any booster packs (23:48 - 23:56)
oh wow that escalated so fast and I mean (23:50 - 23:59)
booster packs cost like four dollars (23:56 - 24:00)
each so I mean that's what I was in (23:59 - 24:03)
three 3:79 I think at your local target (24:00 - 24:07)
there's maybe at your local target at (24:03 - 24:09)
your local Wisconsin Target they might (24:07 - 24:12)
be 399 now if you're a $10 spectator or (24:09 - 24:14)
whatever and you get to booster packs (24:12 - 24:17)
it's not I mean (24:14 - 24:19)
like my dollars suspected at that point (24:17 - 24:21)
yeah and my question is if I'm a (24:19 - 24:24)
spectator do I can i play in the side (24:21 - 24:28)
events yeah cuz those are a thing I'm (24:24 - 24:30)
pretty sure yes that's how it's always (24:28 - 24:31)
been (24:30 - 24:33)
I know but is it still because they're (24:31 - 24:35)
making all these changes I mean $60 to (24:33 - 24:37)
go and play at us I even though it's (24:35 - 24:38)
called the North American International (24:37 - 24:40)
video game championship it is US (24:38 - 24:43)
Nationals uh that's a lot of money I (24:40 - 24:45)
mean yeah you're getting some goodies (24:43 - 24:49)
but you are it used to be free folks you (24:45 - 24:51)
are and so we were talking about this (24:49 - 24:53)
before the show and I brought up dota (24:51 - 24:56)
because the dota I don't I don't watch (24:53 - 24:57)
dota (24:56 - 24:59)
I don't play dota so please forgive me I (24:57 - 25:02)
just know dota from consuming enough (24:59 - 25:05)
giantbomb content that it's a big thing (25:02 - 25:08)
so for the 2016 dota International a (25:05 - 25:11)
midweek ticket cost $75 will grant (25:08 - 25:13)
entrance to the first four days of the (25:11 - 25:18)
event the finals tickets will be $100 (25:13 - 25:20)
and will grant access to the last two (25:18 - 25:22)
days of the main event both ticket (25:20 - 25:23)
options can be purchased single or (25:22 - 25:26)
together like that is that that is just (25:23 - 25:29)
to go to the International that is for (25:26 - 25:30)
spectators right there (25:29 - 25:32)
well they well here's the thing like the (25:30 - 25:34)
teams that go to the International I'm (25:32 - 25:35)
pretty sure they get in for free just (25:34 - 25:37)
like if you get enough championship (25:35 - 25:40)
points for worlds you go to worms for (25:37 - 25:43)
free but I'm I'm sure the the (25:40 - 25:44)
tournaments leading up to the (25:43 - 25:46)
International cost money or something to (25:44 - 25:49)
participate in right you're not I'm sure (25:46 - 25:52)
they - but I I was saying earlier - that (25:49 - 25:54)
it's a little bit of a different (25:52 - 25:56)
situation I think yeah they're both (25:54 - 25:59)
competitive games and and they're both (25:56 - 26:04)
big franchises but dota 2 is like one of (25:59 - 26:06)
the largest competitive platforms in the (26:04 - 26:11)
world for competitive gaming dota 2 for (26:06 - 26:15)
2017 it's prize pool is 8.5 million (26:11 - 26:19)
holy smokes get out there and play your (26:15 - 26:21)
video games kids alright so we're gonna (26:19 - 26:26)
start - dota 2 podcast um it's also I (26:21 - 26:30)
mean I guess to me the most significant (26:26 - 26:33)
difference is that the Pokemon the VGC (26:30 - 26:36)
stuff is geared more towards kids where (26:33 - 26:40)
dota isn't and I would think that it (26:36 - 26:41)
would be a little bit more like (26:40 - 26:44)
family-friendly as pricing goes I think (26:41 - 26:47)
like but 10 to 15 dollars to see an (26:44 - 26:50)
event is pretty family-friendly not to (26:47 - 26:52)
mention that you're also getting booster (26:50 - 26:55)
packs yeah that's okay I have they had (26:52 - 26:58)
to pay for to spectate previously I (26:55 - 27:00)
don't know enough about vino this is the (26:58 - 27:02)
this is the first year you're paying de (27:00 - 27:05)
spectate that seems odd to me I mean it (27:02 - 27:08)
just in general because it's it seems (27:05 - 27:09)
odd that they're charging to spectate (27:08 - 27:11)
but then it seems odd that they're (27:09 - 27:13)
offering booster packs for people who (27:11 - 27:17)
pay to spectate because it well okay so (27:13 - 27:21)
hang at that point I think I think I and (27:17 - 27:23)
will feel free to chime in but I feel (27:21 - 27:25)
like you're paying for responsibility at (27:23 - 27:28)
that point if I lived in Indiana and I (27:25 - 27:31)
had nothing to do and I had a slight (27:28 - 27:34)
interest in Pokemon let's go to this (27:31 - 27:35)
place where there's a bunch of Pokemon (27:34 - 27:39)
people and let's walk around an open (27:35 - 27:41)
convention center I I didn't pay (27:39 - 27:44)
anything so if I if I try to steal from (27:41 - 27:46)
this vendor or I try to steal somebody's (27:44 - 27:51)
backpack or I decide to trash the (27:46 - 27:53)
bathroom and I get kicked out that was (27:51 - 27:57)
my afternoon right I um yeah whereas oh (27:53 - 28:01)
this event cost $10 now rather just stay (27:57 - 28:05)
at home and watch dota 2 on Twitch (28:01 - 28:05)
so I mean I mean there have been (28:06 - 28:10)
problems of people stealing things at (28:08 - 28:12)
Pokemon US Nationals I mean I had a (28:10 - 28:14)
friend of mine who like their backpack (28:12 - 28:17)
got stolen and they had won a couple of (28:14 - 28:19)
boxes and the boxes got stolen and I'm (28:17 - 28:22)
sure like yeah and pokemon cards are not (28:19 - 28:25)
cheap like Mewtwo e^x at one point was (28:22 - 28:28)
$80 and you needed four in a deck I find (28:25 - 28:30)
it hard to believe though that's ten (28:28 - 28:32)
dollars is gonna stop somebody from (28:30 - 28:35)
showing up in stealing stuff it now it (28:32 - 28:37)
provides enough crowd control it really (28:35 - 28:39)
does just putting that little bit of (28:37 - 28:43)
financial in what do you want to MSA not (28:39 - 28:47)
incentive but weird I mean it just stops (28:43 - 28:49)
the off the street people it also (28:47 - 28:51)
probably pays for more security guards (28:49 - 28:53)
you're getting your money back in (28:51 - 28:55)
boosters which i think is so if you (28:53 - 28:59)
don't play the TCG you're still it one (28:55 - 29:01)
it's free advertising two hopefully (28:59 - 29:05)
maybe make you play the TCG also it (29:01 - 29:07)
doesn't cost Pokemon any money to print (29:05 - 29:11)
paper cards right oh yeah though their (29:07 - 29:13)
profit on TCG cards like they're (29:11 - 29:15)
spending fifty cents to print a pack of (29:13 - 29:17)
cards including the foil wrapper and (29:15 - 29:19)
everything and making three dollars and (29:17 - 29:21)
fifty cents off of it so while uh here (29:19 - 29:23)
is my point so while you're paying (29:21 - 29:25)
fifteen dollars and you're getting three (29:23 - 29:27)
packs which no more or less comes to (29:25 - 29:30)
fifteen dollars you go oh it doesn't (29:27 - 29:32)
seem like pokemons making any money but (29:30 - 29:34)
obviously their profit profit margins (29:32 - 29:36)
are incredible on that stuff and that (29:34 - 29:38)
probably helps pay for more security (29:36 - 29:41)
guards I could see that you prevent you (29:38 - 29:44)
know bathrooms getting crashed it just (29:41 - 29:47)
seems odd to me to go from not charging (29:44 - 29:49)
spectators for years and then suddenly (29:47 - 29:51)
charging spectators and then saying I (29:49 - 29:54)
don't know here's free packs but like (29:51 - 29:57)
but maybe it's also just as simple as (29:54 - 30:01)
its it's a it's like like number (29:57 - 30:05)
collecting it forces people to register (30:01 - 30:07)
so they see how many people they're (30:05 - 30:10)
getting to come mmm that does help too (30:07 - 30:12)
but it has actually been a graduate (30:10 - 30:14)
hasn't gone from zero to sixty right (30:12 - 30:15)
right (30:14 - 30:18)
yeah they did that's my graduate (30:15 - 30:19)
solution asou (30:18 - 30:23)
you did thank you yeah there's the the (30:19 - 30:25)
prize pool has also gotten bigger every (30:23 - 30:25)
year (30:25 - 30:29)
which it just seems like they want (30:25 - 30:33)
people to take this more seriously and (30:29 - 30:37)
they can't do that at the point of just (30:33 - 30:40)
letting you know 800 people come in for (30:37 - 30:44)
free and watch and then walk out whereas (30:40 - 30:48)
those 800 people could probably all be (30:44 - 30:52)
fine with paying $10 and hey that lets (30:48 - 30:55)
us now stream that helps pay for (30:52 - 30:57)
streaming which then it gets more people (30:55 - 30:58)
to watch which then gets more people (30:57 - 31:01)
interested in playing it's the whole you (30:58 - 31:03)
gotta you gotta spend money to make (31:01 - 31:06)
money and they've been they've been (31:03 - 31:09)
spending money and now they need now (31:06 - 31:13)
they need money you're right that makes (31:09 - 31:16)
sense and and I think it also for a lot (31:13 - 31:19)
of the parents that are going and taking (31:16 - 31:21)
their kids they're getting boosters for (31:19 - 31:23)
their kids because they're probably not (31:21 - 31:24)
going to use them unless they play with (31:23 - 31:26)
them and there's a lot of ants that do (31:24 - 31:29)
that money is going to something that's (31:26 - 31:33)
also going to the kid and it's I mean (31:29 - 31:34)
it's not like the parents aren't going (31:33 - 31:36)
to pay ten or fifteen dollars if they're (31:34 - 31:38)
bringing their kid there so you're right (31:36 - 31:41)
yeah I I think I think it's fine like I (31:38 - 31:44)
can't think of any other you know eSport (31:41 - 31:47)
related things whether that's dota or (31:44 - 31:49)
Street Fighter or whatever fight (31:47 - 31:51)
whatever the fighting game invitational (31:49 - 31:53)
is called like that all cost money to (31:51 - 31:57)
Evo Evo yep I have to pick it back up to (31:53 - 31:58)
talk about the side event stuff real (31:57 - 31:58)
quick (31:58 - 32:01)
it looks like anyone can participate in (31:58 - 32:03)
that but that side of that side stuff (32:01 - 32:05)
does cost money if you want to (32:03 - 32:06)
participate in a battle royale that's (32:05 - 32:09)
ten dollars a person on demand pickups (32:06 - 32:14)
$5 j jr round-robin is free standard (32:09 - 32:17)
video game format $10 battle royale $10 (32:14 - 32:22)
VGC multi cup $10 per player $8 on (32:17 - 32:26)
demand pickups $5 if you want a TCG (32:22 - 32:28)
sealed tournament which i believe is (32:26 - 32:30)
when you get like four or five booster (32:28 - 32:31)
packs and you open them when you make a (32:30 - 32:32)
deck that's 20 (32:31 - 32:34)
dollars you get to keep those cards when (32:32 - 32:38)
you're done standard mastered TCG side (32:34 - 32:41)
tournament $10 so they have this (32:38 - 32:43)
throughout the entire weekend I don't (32:41 - 32:44)
know if you're getting something from (32:43 - 32:46)
the video game stuff like I I know what (32:44 - 32:48)
a battle royale is it's for people (32:46 - 32:52)
fighting and it's $10 I don't know get (32:48 - 32:53)
anything I'm sure there are prizes (32:52 - 32:55)
there's always been prizes for that (32:53 - 32:58)
stuff that 10 bucks may go to a prize (32:55 - 33:01)
pool for the winner yeah I think so (32:58 - 33:04)
cuz if you did like what was it well was (33:01 - 33:07)
it like a 24 man or like a 36 man like (33:04 - 33:10)
TCG tournament we we did it it was free (33:07 - 33:11)
at the time when we were at night yes (33:10 - 33:14)
but the winner got like a like a full (33:11 - 33:15)
box yep (33:14 - 33:17)
yeah the side defense were free and they (33:15 - 33:21)
had real prizes so yeah I don't know (33:17 - 33:24)
maybe they just found out that they were (33:21 - 33:26)
losing a lot of money from doing too (33:24 - 33:29)
many free prize or or maybe they found (33:26 - 33:32)
out that that these side events weren't (33:29 - 33:34)
doing well because they were free and no (33:32 - 33:36)
one wanted to waste time on free stuff (33:34 - 33:38)
where people wanted to pay $5.00 and (33:36 - 33:41)
hopefully like $5 for a chance to win a (33:38 - 33:44)
$120 box like those are good odds (33:41 - 33:47)
yeah but also we haven't gone in years (33:44 - 33:50)
and maybe like when X&Y came out Pokemon (33:47 - 33:52)
just became so much more popular that (33:50 - 33:54)
that many more people were coming like (33:52 - 33:56)
when we went and it was free it was it (33:54 - 33:59)
was a manageable size de vent but I (33:56 - 34:02)
haven't seen it right so it just may (33:59 - 34:05)
have become this huge event that they (34:02 - 34:06)
need to have a little more control over (34:05 - 34:09)
it could also be as simple as they (34:06 - 34:12)
determined that they could put a price (34:09 - 34:13)
tag on whatever and people are gonna pay (34:12 - 34:16)
it you can't put a price tag on my heart (34:13 - 34:20)
Micah we'll see if you volunteer like (34:16 - 34:22)
run events or whatnot because they do (34:20 - 34:24)
have a lot of volunteers they pay you in (34:22 - 34:27)
TCG cards correct get that and I'll tell (34:24 - 34:30)
you something sweet teeth I guess I have (34:27 - 34:33)
recently been looking into selling off (34:30 - 34:36)
my old TCG cards that might like old (34:33 - 34:37)
full arts and stuff that I've held on to (34:36 - 34:39)
and boy oh boy have those retained their (34:37 - 34:43)
value those things are still worth money (34:39 - 34:46)
yep yeah are those for (34:43 - 34:49)
like volunteering no no these are just (34:46 - 34:51)
like we're from when I used to play well (34:49 - 34:54)
to volunteer I don't know the Segway I (34:51 - 34:56)
thought maybe it was from volunteering (34:54 - 34:58)
if you want Willie Anderson you're gonna (34:56 - 35:00)
pay and you're gonna pay cash money (34:58 - 35:03)
not Pokemon Trading Cards I don't know (35:00 - 35:06)
if you got if you got $100 box of TCG (35:03 - 35:09)
cards you can make $100 probably with (35:06 - 35:12)
two of those cards in that box that (35:09 - 35:15)
depends on your polls right get a secret (35:12 - 35:17)
rare rayquaza something like that yeah (35:15 - 35:19)
but it's a full bar friend it's not like (35:17 - 35:21)
open packs were like somebody (35:19 - 35:23)
individually weighed them prior to (35:21 - 35:26)
giving him - you know you just mapped it (35:23 - 35:29)
and then sold the non ultra rare back (35:26 - 35:33)
yeah eBay oh man that's let's just let's (35:29 - 35:36)
spill all the tea on the the TCG problem (35:33 - 35:40)
so late last bit of news here is the (35:36 - 35:43)
magic harp song oh boy the magic harp (35:40 - 35:46)
song titled I love magic harp is a song (35:43 - 35:50)
made for or I love Culkin sand a site (35:46 - 35:54)
made in commemoration of a cross between (35:50 - 35:57)
Hiroshima Toyo carp and the Pokemon (35:54 - 36:02)
Center in Hiroshima music is credited to (35:57 - 36:05)
following Japanese name it was released (36:02 - 36:06)
on the official Japanese YouTube channel (36:05 - 36:10)
on July 28 2016 a dance version was (36:06 - 36:14)
uploaded February 23rd 2017 to promote (36:10 - 36:17)
the upcoming mobile game splash Magikarp (36:14 - 36:19)
the song later debuted in English on May (36:17 - 36:21)
12th and was shown on the official (36:19 - 36:24)
English YouTube channel on the French (36:21 - 36:26)
German Italian Spanish YouTube channels (36:24 - 36:27)
the song was released with Japanese (36:26 - 36:30)
vocals and subtitles in their respective (36:27 - 36:32)
languages now we don't know much about (36:30 - 36:34)
splash Magikarp we just know that it's (36:32 - 36:36)
an upcoming spin-off game for iOS and (36:34 - 36:38)
Android scheduled to be released Japan (36:36 - 36:41)
the spring no word on any other date (36:38 - 36:43)
there that's why we haven't really (36:41 - 36:46)
talked about it have all hey I mean I've (36:43 - 36:48)
seen the Magikarp song a hundred times (36:46 - 36:52)
now will and Myka have you seen slash (36:48 - 36:56)
listened to set song I watched at your (36:52 - 36:58)
house and then I watched it twice since (36:56 - 36:59)
then (36:58 - 37:01)
I watched it once on my own and then I (36:59 - 37:03)
saw you saying very ignorant things (37:01 - 37:05)
about it on the internet and I decided (37:03 - 37:08)
not to watch it again well I have said (37:05 - 37:10)
nothing but good things about this ah (37:08 - 37:17)
incorrect you went on our giving where (37:10 - 37:19)
somebody said oh I like the Japanese (37:17 - 37:22)
vocals better and then you said oh no I (37:19 - 37:24)
hate the Japanese version because I (37:22 - 37:25)
don't understand what they're saying and (37:24 - 37:27)
I need it to be in English and I don't (37:25 - 37:28)
want to hear the Japanese classically (37:27 - 37:30)
and understand the words I don't like (37:28 - 37:33)
the song classic will always being wrong (37:30 - 37:37)
first uh I didn't say I hated the (37:33 - 37:39)
Japanese version I said I don't (37:37 - 37:42)
understand why people that speak English (37:39 - 37:45)
like Japanese versions better because (37:42 - 37:48)
you can't understand the words and my (37:45 - 37:52)
point was the words are what make the (37:48 - 37:56)
song good it's not like the music or the (37:52 - 37:59)
animation is selling you on the song oh (37:56 - 38:02)
it certainly is yeah it is more or less (37:59 - 38:05)
lovely music the why the why the (38:02 - 38:08)
magikarp song is so incredible is (38:05 - 38:09)
because of how Shady (38:08 - 38:13)
it is to magic art it is not it is so (38:09 - 38:17)
shady very loving of magikarp I'm gonna (38:13 - 38:20)
give a tattoo on my bicep of magic harp (38:17 - 38:24)
that says number one the weakest because (38:20 - 38:26)
I love magic harp so much now yeah thank (38:24 - 38:29)
you Pokemon company it's on my body (38:26 - 38:31)
forever while some people might think (38:29 - 38:33)
the song you know sounds better in (38:31 - 38:36)
Japanese because for whatever reason (38:33 - 38:41)
they think the lyrics are more magical (38:36 - 38:44)
to their ears in a different language we (38:41 - 38:47)
just have this conversation you don't (38:44 - 38:49)
get the the shady they like that (38:47 - 38:51)
shadiness doesn't come through like if (38:49 - 38:54)
you if you if you think it sounds better (38:51 - 38:56)
fine like I'm not going to say you're (38:54 - 38:56)
right or wrong (38:56 - 38:59)
but you're still not getting the the (38:56 - 39:03)
underlying message of how poorly they (38:59 - 39:05)
treat Magikarp at the beginning of the (39:03 - 39:07)
song and then how like it turns into (39:05 - 39:10)
like this is a love song yeah so see (39:07 - 39:12)
that's your misinterpretation of the (39:10 - 39:13)
word shade if you're throwing (39:12 - 39:15)
shade there's never any love behind it (39:13 - 39:19)
so that's the twist so it's not Shady (39:15 - 39:22)
it's a loving snow it's super shady and (39:19 - 39:25)
then the twist comes in the last two (39:22 - 39:28)
verses because the third verse says the (39:25 - 39:31)
pity Pokemon that's you although they (39:28 - 39:32)
think you're worthless you've won my (39:31 - 39:35)
heart that's when the twist begins (39:32 - 39:39)
because she stops putting him down at (39:35 - 39:41)
that point I didn't get I didn't look at (39:39 - 39:45)
it that deeply I got the message that I (39:41 - 39:48)
got all the way throughout was Magikarp (39:45 - 39:50)
is garbage but I still love it cuz it's (39:48 - 39:53)
cute and it's it it's like it's like (39:50 - 39:55)
when you love something because it's (39:53 - 39:57)
ugly like it's ugly but it's cute (39:55 - 40:00)
because it's ugly you know I agree I (39:57 - 40:03)
agree that's like the whole tone of the (40:00 - 40:06)
entire song like start to finish I don't (40:03 - 40:07)
know where all these twists and turns (40:06 - 40:09)
are coming from where all this these (40:07 - 40:10)
dramatics (40:09 - 40:14)
oh I but I will say this we had a (40:10 - 40:17)
conversation while we were watching New (40:14 - 40:20)
Japan Pro Wrestling about how there is (40:17 - 40:23)
there's a specific group of New Japan (40:20 - 40:27)
fans that don't speak Japanese but (40:23 - 40:30)
prefer the Japanese commentary and I (40:27 - 40:33)
think it's the same situation here where (40:30 - 40:38)
we don't really understand why because (40:33 - 40:40)
you can't tell what anyone's saying if (40:38 - 40:42)
you don't understand the language is (40:40 - 40:46)
this like ASMR at that point i okay I I (40:42 - 40:49)
can't I don't know how like deeply to (40:46 - 40:51)
get into this debate but you know I (40:49 - 40:52)
listen to a lot of Vocaloid I listen to (40:51 - 40:54)
a lot of j-pop I listen to a lot of kpop (40:52 - 40:57)
I do not speak Japanese I do not speak (40:54 - 40:59)
Korean I just like the way the music (40:57 - 41:01)
sounds I can agree with it up I don't (40:59 - 41:03)
need to understand the lyrics but maybe (41:01 - 41:05)
people just enjoy the excitement of the (41:03 - 41:07)
New Japan Pro Wrestling a Buescher Road (41:05 - 41:09)
product like the excitement of the (41:07 - 41:12)
announcers I just watch it do they get (41:09 - 41:14)
excited oh they get very excited yeah (41:12 - 41:16)
yeah they get excited here's the (41:14 - 41:18)
difference for me though I agree with (41:16 - 41:20)
you I also like some Vocaloid music and (41:18 - 41:22)
I like some j-pop and I like some kpop (41:20 - 41:23)
and so on what's your favorite Vocaloid (41:22 - 41:26)
album however they're actually I (41:23 - 41:29)
do a lot of hip-hop and there's a big (41:26 - 41:31)
boy track that came out recently from (41:29 - 41:36)
Outkast and he has Vocaloid on the hook (41:31 - 41:38)
for that song which is amazing but (41:36 - 41:41)
here's my point regardless of whether or (41:38 - 41:42)
not you can understand it or not if you (41:41 - 41:44)
enjoy it you enjoy it that's fine (41:42 - 41:48)
but if you are specifically picking the (41:44 - 41:52)
if there if there is an alternative (41:48 - 41:53)
where you can understand it and you're (41:52 - 41:55)
specifically picking the one that you (41:53 - 41:58)
can't understand why is that happening (41:55 - 42:01)
because I want to learn Japanese through (41:58 - 42:04)
osmosis I don't know that that's guy I (42:01 - 42:06)
assume they're picking the one they (42:04 - 42:08)
can't understand because they think that (42:06 - 42:11)
it sounds better and to them they don't (42:08 - 42:14)
care about the words because like there (42:11 - 42:15)
are definitely people who listen to (42:14 - 42:19)
music and they prefer the the beat and (42:15 - 42:22)
the music to the lyrics which I always (42:19 - 42:26)
thought was like that's just my not not (42:22 - 42:26)
my thing (42:26 - 42:30)
like I feel like to me what makes a song (42:26 - 42:34)
good is both music and lyrics I mean I (42:30 - 42:36)
guess it's the same argument as why (42:34 - 42:38)
people are in our argument but the same (42:36 - 42:43)
reason as why people will put on uh like (42:38 - 42:46)
Japanese voiceover and like JRPGs and (42:43 - 42:47)
stuff like that but the difference there (42:46 - 42:49)
is that you have subtitles so that (42:47 - 42:50)
you're understanding the game as you're (42:49 - 42:53)
playing it yeah I mean like I'm sure (42:50 - 42:55)
there was subtitles for the the Japanese (42:53 - 42:58)
version so it was like the Japanese (42:55 - 43:00)
magic harp you know singing it song and (42:58 - 43:03)
then there was subtitles underneath okay (43:00 - 43:06)
well let's change it I'm sure that you (43:03 - 43:07)
still get the message but I think I (43:06 - 43:10)
personally think the the girl singing (43:07 - 43:14)
has a great voice and it fits the song (43:10 - 43:19)
really well and I like the lyrics to me (43:14 - 43:20)
make the song (43:19 - 43:24)
I can I assumed it was a way singing (43:20 - 43:27)
what maybe it is I don't know who knows (43:24 - 43:32)
I certainly see wanting to seek out and (43:27 - 43:34)
listen to things like that like the (43:32 - 43:37)
Japanese version of something if it's (43:34 - 43:39)
the like original version of it because (43:37 - 43:41)
you want to experience the original (43:39 - 43:43)
version or the you know the source (43:41 - 43:47)
material and then experience the cover (43:43 - 43:50)
you know whatever the translation but if (43:47 - 43:53)
you had if if they're there and they're (43:50 - 43:55)
side-by-side and I can't understand one (43:53 - 43:57)
but I can't understand the other I'm (43:55 - 43:59)
probably gonna listen to the one I can (43:57 - 44:01)
understand otherwise I won't understand (43:59 - 44:04)
it this is basically the dub verse sub (44:01 - 44:07)
conversation isn't it pretty much yeah (44:04 - 44:09)
but the difference is that you get you (44:07 - 44:13)
get subtitles with a with a sub so you (44:09 - 44:15)
can still understand it (44:13 - 44:18)
look I've watched like Pan's Labyrinth (44:15 - 44:20)
which that entire movie is in Spanish (44:18 - 44:24)
and so of course me not know it look I (44:20 - 44:25)
can't even speak English more or less (44:24 - 44:30)
another language so you have to subtitle (44:25 - 44:31)
that entire movie and watching that (44:30 - 44:34)
movie is fantastic but if they were to (44:31 - 44:37)
be if they were just like remake that (44:34 - 44:39)
movie in English I would probably just (44:37 - 44:41)
watch the but I actually probably (44:39 - 44:42)
wouldn't watch it again I'm like a (44:41 - 44:46)
one-and-done kind of movie but okay so a (44:42 - 44:48)
good example is like Digimon cuz I've (44:46 - 44:50)
been watching a lot of Digimon and I've (44:48 - 44:52)
seen Adventure one and Adventure 2 (44:50 - 44:54)
probably three or four times at this (44:52 - 44:56)
point all the way through and so when (44:54 - 44:58)
I'm watching Digimon now I have it in (44:56 - 45:01)
the background so I'm mostly listening (44:58 - 45:04)
and I could never imagine watching that (45:01 - 45:08)
subbed because that would require me to (45:04 - 45:11)
look at the screen the entire time to (45:08 - 45:15)
like read it I feel the same way (45:11 - 45:19)
I mean it and watch a watch subbed anime (45:15 - 45:23)
if it's something if it's something that (45:19 - 45:27)
I'm really into I will sometimes watch (45:23 - 45:29)
the sub over the dub depending like I (45:27 - 45:33)
watched the entirety of Naruto with subs (45:29 - 45:36)
because I found the American voice (45:33 - 45:38)
actors for Naruto to be so excruciating (45:36 - 45:40)
but that's just personal preference at (45:38 - 45:43)
that point like I'm still understanding (45:40 - 45:45)
what I'm watching because I'm reading it (45:43 - 45:46)
on the screen (45:45 - 45:50)
you know and and for those that haven't (45:46 - 45:54)
seen the lyrics Japanese lyrics have (45:50 - 45:59)
been translated right to English but the (45:54 - 46:03)
English that we got on May 12th does not (45:59 - 46:06)
match the direct English from the (46:03 - 46:10)
original translation so for example just (46:06 - 46:14)
the the the first verse if you were to (46:10 - 46:17)
translate just the original Japanese it (46:14 - 46:19)
says unreliable and pathetic it's (46:17 - 46:23)
infamously feeble what we got was (46:19 - 46:26)
totally pathetic unreliable known (46:23 - 46:28)
throughout the world for being super (46:26 - 46:31)
weak and then the second verse directly (46:28 - 46:35)
translated was was it very strong long (46:31 - 46:37)
ago there was a rumor about but now it's (46:35 - 46:41)
very weak so tragic what we got is maybe (46:37 - 46:43)
in ancient times it was really strong (46:41 - 46:44)
but that's what the rumors say but (46:43 - 46:47)
they're probably wrong but now it's so (46:44 - 46:49)
weak the weakest in the land so weak (46:47 - 46:51)
it's sad really really sad so you can (46:49 - 46:54)
see that it's dramatically different (46:51 - 46:59)
than the what the Japanese English (46:54 - 47:02)
translates to so what was it (46:59 - 47:04)
dramatically different yeah I don't see (47:02 - 47:08)
it it was I didn't work as a translator (47:04 - 47:11)
in the Brazilian Embassy and even from (47:08 - 47:13)
Brazilian Emmy from Portuguese into (47:11 - 47:16)
English it's it's never easy dude did (47:13 - 47:18)
you ever talk to anybody from Azul what (47:16 - 47:20)
I'm saying now what I'm saying is they (47:18 - 47:23)
could have just put was it there it was (47:20 - 47:25)
it very strong long ago but now there's (47:23 - 47:27)
a rumor about that but now it's very (47:25 - 47:29)
weak so weak it's tragic they (47:27 - 47:30)
could have just put that up they could (47:29 - 47:33)
have just translated like that but (47:30 - 47:35)
instead they rewrote the song that (47:33 - 47:37)
didn't meet the tambour of the of the (47:35 - 47:40)
music I'm sure that's part of it to you (47:37 - 47:44)
right I don't like match the look I'm (47:40 - 47:45)
not gonna read the entire four minutes (47:44 - 47:49)
on we do it really different then as (47:45 - 47:52)
those translations are met all I'm (47:49 - 47:54)
saying is that speaks to the fact that (47:52 - 47:56)
they put work into this they could have (47:54 - 47:59)
just straight-up translated it but (47:56 - 48:01)
instead they they rewrote the song and (47:59 - 48:04)
then they cast somebody to sing it and I (48:01 - 48:06)
think it's fantastic I think it's all (48:04 - 48:08)
great and I hope that we see more of (48:06 - 48:10)
this stuff because I love it who would (48:08 - 48:11)
have thought they would have made a (48:10 - 48:15)
four-minute song about magic oh what a (48:11 - 48:16)
time to be alive (48:15 - 48:18)
what a time to be alive all right so (48:16 - 48:19)
what we'll do here is we'll take a quick (48:18 - 48:21)
break and then when we come back we got (48:19 - 48:23)
our interview with Joe from Sarah B so (48:21 - 48:27)
we will be right back (48:23 - 48:27)
I don't hate how that sub is good (48:32 - 48:40)
areum's like boring and bad selves get (48:36 - 48:49)
I'm interesting Zelda's gift there's (48:40 - 48:52)
probably a horse at some point (48:49 - 48:52)
and we are back from our break (48:56 - 49:03)
I'm here with with Joe who runs Sarah be (49:00 - 49:06)
Donna is it Sarah be calm or serviette (49:03 - 49:09)
have you updates don't NAT dotnet still (49:06 - 49:11)
don't that you don't do you have the (49:09 - 49:13)
right into questions do you not have the (49:11 - 49:16)
dock half I'd know some advertising (49:13 - 49:18)
company has it and I'm sure they're (49:16 - 49:20)
wanting like they're sitting on it for a (49:18 - 49:22)
couple thousand dollars probably (49:20 - 49:25)
probably something that but I'm fine no (49:22 - 49:27)
sorry we don't know it sounds cool isn't (49:25 - 49:30)
Sarah be calm so Joe welcome back the (49:27 - 49:32)
last time you were on was I think (49:30 - 49:37)
episode 150 so we're 265 so like three (49:32 - 49:40)
years ago now crazy long time yeah you (49:37 - 49:43)
run this you run this very tiny Pokemon (49:40 - 49:45)
website not a lot of people know about (49:43 - 49:50)
it but the for our listeners though (49:45 - 49:52)
maybe maybe two of them have not been to (49:50 - 49:54)
your website I don't know uh thinner (49:52 - 49:56)
that's a big place who are you and what (49:54 - 49:59)
do you do okay well I am Joe Merrick and (49:56 - 50:03)
I run Wow owned and run Sarah beat net (49:59 - 50:05)
which is the biggest Pokemon fan site (50:03 - 50:08)
arguably on the internet I think I can (50:05 - 50:10)
agree with that right like it's like you (50:08 - 50:13)
and bobble pedia or like one and two and (50:10 - 50:15)
sometimes you guys flips out every now (50:13 - 50:17)
and then yeah we like Neptune and Pluto (50:15 - 50:19)
in our orbits once I flip once a head (50:17 - 50:22)
the next time the others ahead I and so (50:19 - 50:25)
I think a quite at probably probably (50:22 - 50:26)
some questions we've asked before but (50:25 - 50:29)
you know things change uh I think a lot (50:26 - 50:32)
of a lot of people want to know is Sarah (50:29 - 50:34)
be your full-time job is how what you do (50:32 - 50:36)
for a living I consider it a full-time (50:34 - 50:40)
hobby mean I do do some freelance stuff (50:36 - 50:44)
on the sides but yeah you could say it's (50:40 - 50:48)
full-time and I do do it all hours right (50:44 - 50:51)
I'm a Annette I would assume that when (50:48 - 50:53)
Sun and Moon came out it was more than (50:51 - 50:56)
full time but probably we have probably (50:53 - 51:00)
now a 2007 it's a little more chill yeah (50:56 - 51:02)
it's for quiet time speaking of Sun and (51:00 - 51:06)
Moon what this is such a load to (51:02 - 51:07)
question what are your thoughts like (51:06 - 51:10)
from both you know the workload (51:07 - 51:12)
effective of you putting everything on (51:10 - 51:15)
the site and just the a personal and fan (51:12 - 51:18)
perspective of you being a pokemon (51:15 - 51:19)
trainer again (51:18 - 51:23)
oh well workload was crazy it always is (51:19 - 51:25)
with the main series game I'm constantly (51:23 - 51:27)
playing it I'm constantly updating and (51:25 - 51:29)
making sure everything's up there and as (51:27 - 51:32)
accurate as possible as fast ball and as (51:29 - 51:36)
I am just one person that so that is a (51:32 - 51:39)
lot of work so I could go sleep I didn't (51:36 - 51:43)
go out for a couple of weeks I just was (51:39 - 51:45)
working on it non-stop but it's still (51:43 - 51:48)
fun today I wouldn't be doing it if it (51:45 - 51:52)
wasn't fun yeah yeah is there when do (51:48 - 51:55)
you when you're playing it and I do what (51:52 - 51:56)
I do want to know your thoughts on how (51:55 - 51:58)
you enjoyed the game and everything but (51:56 - 51:59)
when you're playing it when do you (51:58 - 52:01)
decide do you have like a system in (51:59 - 52:02)
place or do you like come across (52:01 - 52:05)
something and then go okay I need to (52:02 - 52:08)
stop now and upload the site or does the (52:05 - 52:11)
excitement of playing go like okay maybe (52:08 - 52:13)
I'll update the set in like five more (52:11 - 52:14)
minutes I kind of want to see where this (52:13 - 52:15)
is going (52:14 - 52:19)
I might typically just it's what women (52:15 - 52:21)
main series game comes out I do a (52:19 - 52:23)
discovery thread on the forums and so (52:21 - 52:27)
everything is per ton there and on the (52:23 - 52:30)
main site a spoiler tag typically so (52:27 - 52:32)
basically everything that is personal (52:30 - 52:34)
basically anything relevant to you (52:32 - 52:38)
anything will go up on the discovery (52:34 - 52:40)
Fred and major stuff will go up in the (52:38 - 52:42)
spoiler tag and then once I'm done with (52:40 - 52:45)
the playthrough then that's when I start (52:42 - 52:48)
making pages okay so you do have (52:45 - 52:51)
somewhat of a system yeah what were your (52:48 - 52:53)
thoughts though on the gamers as just as (52:51 - 52:55)
just a fan and not and not somebody (52:53 - 52:58)
working you know 700 hours a week to (52:55 - 53:03)
update the site uh well I really enjoyed (52:58 - 53:05)
them it was a nice fresh take on Pokemon (53:03 - 53:09)
I mean it was nice to have the story as (53:05 - 53:12)
full-on as it was even though but I (53:09 - 53:14)
would have liked a bit more freedom and (53:12 - 53:17)
it was good to have changes from how it (53:14 - 53:20)
always has been because having 20 years (53:17 - 53:23)
and going Jim - Jim - Jim - Jim (53:20 - 53:27)
it's a bit it can be wearing and so (53:23 - 53:29)
having the trials and the grand trials (53:27 - 53:30)
and everything it was it was a nice (53:29 - 53:32)
change not saying that's how I want the (53:30 - 53:36)
series to be constantly now but it was a (53:32 - 53:38)
nice change and it was it felt to me (53:36 - 53:40)
like a great celebration of 20 years of (53:38 - 53:43)
Pokemon yeah so I really enjoyed it so (53:40 - 53:45)
you know you have you have the trials (53:43 - 53:47)
the game so it ends with the Elite Four (53:45 - 53:50)
you have a bunch of old Pokemon and of (53:47 - 53:51)
course the mix of new Pokemon was there (53:50 - 53:54)
anything that kind of stood out that you (53:51 - 53:57)
did really like that you possibly wanted (53:54 - 54:00)
to see in a future game and then (53:57 - 54:02)
follow-up question were there any (54:00 - 54:03)
Pokemon that stood out where you were (54:02 - 54:06)
like heck yes this two cannon is the (54:03 - 54:10)
best um well I'm trying to think of (54:06 - 54:13)
stuff which didn't sit right with me I (54:10 - 54:16)
mean I don't anything where is man I (54:13 - 54:18)
guess a postgame would always be nice to (54:16 - 54:20)
have a bit more to the postgame just (54:18 - 54:22)
like the battle frontier or something (54:20 - 54:24)
like that just to Silla teas which you (54:22 - 54:26)
can just keep playing other than like (54:24 - 54:28)
the battle tree which is just a nature (54:26 - 54:31)
version of the battle tower yeah and (54:28 - 54:34)
Pokemon well I really liked all the new (54:31 - 54:36)
so many of a new pokemon I mean you've (54:34 - 54:38)
got to Sid UI that's basically the green (54:36 - 54:38)
arrow (54:38 - 54:42)
yeah hunger wrong with that wishy-washys (54:38 - 54:44)
a fantastic one Iraq who needs a (54:42 - 54:46)
fantastic one I mean I could just list (54:44 - 54:48)
for the entire pokedex and say well (54:46 - 54:53)
that's a fantastic one speaking of the (54:48 - 54:56)
postgame stuff I I asked this question (54:53 - 54:58)
on Twitter and I was going to put it in (54:56 - 54:59)
our new segment but I figured I'd save (54:58 - 55:01)
it for you just because I feel like (54:59 - 55:03)
you'd have more insight on this but I (55:01 - 55:05)
pretty much asked if people were still (55:03 - 55:07)
playing Pokemon Sun and Moon at all now (55:05 - 55:09)
I mean we've we're six months removed (55:07 - 55:12)
from when the game originally lost but (55:09 - 55:13)
fifty eight percent of people said (55:12 - 55:15)
they're not playing it at all anymore a (55:13 - 55:17)
31 percent of people say they played at (55:15 - 55:20)
least once weekly and 11 percent of (55:17 - 55:23)
people are said they play it daily so (55:20 - 55:25)
dear what are your thoughts on that does (55:23 - 55:26)
that seem to line up with you know your (55:25 - 55:28)
history with the series of people (55:26 - 55:31)
dropping off six months after or do you (55:28 - 55:33)
think because of the lack of a postgame (55:31 - 55:35)
it's more of a drop-off I think it's (55:33 - 55:36)
Todd's Prima (55:35 - 55:38)
part of the course for every Pokemon (55:36 - 55:41)
game aim game free curve / out saying (55:38 - 55:44)
that based on their research a very very (55:41 - 55:45)
small percentage of people actually (55:44 - 55:47)
bother with the battle frontier when (55:45 - 55:50)
it's in their game and so the post games (55:47 - 55:53)
really for the more hardcore fair and a (55:50 - 55:54)
lot of the people who are still playing (55:53 - 55:57)
and more of the competitive kinds people (55:54 - 55:59)
who go to like BGC events and things (55:57 - 56:02)
like that so it sounds that sounds about (55:59 - 56:03)
right I mean a lot of people just played (56:02 - 56:06)
to the end they get all the Pokemon and (56:03 - 56:08)
then they're done yeah it just seems (56:06 - 56:11)
standard to me okay get it I'm assuming (56:08 - 56:14)
Sarah B has seen a minor decrease in (56:11 - 56:16)
traffic because of what the numbers we (56:14 - 56:18)
just talked about 58 percent of people (56:16 - 56:21)
not playing at all anymore uh yeah I was (56:18 - 56:23)
actually looking about yesterday I try (56:21 - 56:26)
not to look at stats too often because I (56:23 - 56:28)
get obsessed with numbers and think oh (56:26 - 56:30)
no that's down oh no that's up only (56:28 - 56:31)
that's down oh god oh god (56:30 - 56:35)
defender hanok but it's back down to (56:31 - 56:37)
around where it was when Pokemon go came (56:35 - 56:41)
out okay did you see do you get you know (56:37 - 56:43)
I'm sure you do but like did Sarah B get (56:41 - 56:45)
a huge increase when Pokemon girl came (56:43 - 56:48)
out or was that or did other decent (56:45 - 56:49)
increase (56:48 - 56:51)
I mean Pokemon go to sort of game where (56:49 - 56:53)
people won't hunt out stuff around the (56:51 - 56:55)
internet other than like trackers and (56:53 - 56:58)
things like that it's not really a game (56:55 - 57:00)
based on needing information so people (56:58 - 57:02)
don't necessarily go hunting for it (57:00 - 57:04)
because it's not like you can go oh I (57:02 - 57:06)
really need to hand out where where do I (57:04 - 57:08)
get that I know I'll go on to Sarah be (57:06 - 57:10)
like you could with gold and silver and (57:08 - 57:14)
X&Y right so it's not really back (57:10 - 57:16)
information focus there's always a small (57:14 - 57:18)
spike whenever there's an event and I (57:16 - 57:20)
tweet that out because that gets a lot (57:18 - 57:24)
of traction sure sure again this is more (57:20 - 57:26)
website question just me being curious (57:24 - 57:29)
but like so obviously made serious games (57:26 - 57:31)
bringing the most to Serbia and (57:29 - 57:33)
obviously you you index everything you (57:31 - 57:35)
have the Pokedex you have the moves and (57:33 - 57:37)
stuff but you report on everything (57:35 - 57:39)
whether that's you know anime news or (57:37 - 57:42)
spin-off games like splash Magikarp or (57:39 - 57:46)
even like you report on like not weekly (57:42 - 57:48)
but bi-weekly however often they update (57:46 - 57:50)
Pokemon shuffle so (57:48 - 57:52)
people come to the site - for that is (57:50 - 57:54)
there is there a point where you go like (57:52 - 57:56)
I don't know why I'm updating Pokemon (57:54 - 57:59)
shuffle like no one's reading this or or (57:56 - 58:01)
does you know everything you post do (57:59 - 58:04)
well at some extent in various (58:01 - 58:05)
interesting pretty much everything I do (58:04 - 58:08)
I mean the shuffle tweets and news that (58:05 - 58:11)
gets some traction and same with Pokemon (58:08 - 58:11)
duel (58:11 - 58:14)
I mean sometimes it does feel like on (58:11 - 58:17)
all I'm doing is posting about apps and (58:14 - 58:20)
that's a bit you know disheartening but (58:17 - 58:23)
I mean don't get me wrong but I get (58:20 - 58:25)
that's where gaming is right now but (58:23 - 58:30)
it's a bit sad yeah I mean I like the (58:25 - 58:33)
full full-on spin-off games and having (58:30 - 58:37)
games which just services with stuff (58:33 - 58:40)
coming every week or every two weeks I I (58:37 - 58:42)
get it and it's actually great for me (58:40 - 58:43)
because it means I've always got (58:42 - 58:47)
something to do but I really it's just a (58:43 - 58:49)
bit disheartening I I mean we haven't (58:47 - 58:51)
had a proper spin-off game since pokken (58:49 - 58:54)
in March really have we yeah cuz mystery (58:51 - 58:57)
dungeon was before that super um that (58:54 - 59:00)
was infamous remember 2015 yeah that's (58:57 - 59:03)
when I covered it so we have are you (59:00 - 59:05)
into these mobile games though we have (59:03 - 59:07)
Pokemon duel Pokemon shuffle (59:05 - 59:10)
I guess Pokemon Rumble world was kind of (59:07 - 59:13)
like a mobile game on 3ds do you play (59:10 - 59:14)
those do they grab your interest I mean (59:13 - 59:17)
I I know the answer I know you play them (59:14 - 59:19)
because you're a Pokemon fan but like do (59:17 - 59:21)
you stick with them I guess for the most (59:19 - 59:24)
part eyes I enjoy them Iong shuffles a (59:21 - 59:26)
fun game even though they're later (59:24 - 59:29)
levels have really become ridiculously (59:26 - 59:33)
bloated in terms of the hit points you (59:29 - 59:35)
have to take off of the Pokemon and it's (59:33 - 59:37)
like oh they're asking for more and more (59:35 - 59:40)
money all you need to spend so many (59:37 - 59:43)
hours grinding for it and runs a bit (59:40 - 59:46)
there but really I do enjoy the spin-off (59:43 - 59:48)
games I mean I don't really enjoy the (59:46 - 59:50)
mystery dungeon games that much I mean (59:48 - 59:52)
sorry to voting like it I mean I love (59:50 - 59:54)
the presentation to them I love this I (59:52 - 59:56)
love music I love the story I just (59:54 - 59:59)
cannot stand that gameplay but yeah I (59:56 - 60:03)
still play most of the games I mean do (59:59 - 60:03)
and shuff (60:03 - 60:07)
I play weekly I mean do I tried to play (60:03 - 60:10)
more often but like other games like (60:07 - 60:12)
mobile games it's too random based so (60:10 - 60:14)
it's like that skill but there's also (60:12 - 60:16)
not skill and that sucks (60:14 - 60:19)
so I enjoy them I still play them and I (60:16 - 60:21)
look forward to splash Magikarp because (60:19 - 60:23)
that seems like it could be really (60:21 - 60:26)
interesting yeah we're still talking (60:23 - 60:29)
about mobile games it seems like at (60:26 - 60:31)
least that you know following you on (60:29 - 60:34)
Twitter you you're a go player and it (60:31 - 60:36)
seems like you're still into that yes (60:34 - 60:39)
what are your thoughts on go overall um (60:36 - 60:42)
I was really really against at first (60:39 - 60:44)
before it came out I was like this is (60:42 - 60:47)
terrible idea I mean it's gonna be (60:44 - 60:50)
terrible but when it came out I was (60:47 - 60:53)
surprised it was really lots and lots of (60:50 - 60:56)
fun I enjoyed going out with my (60:53 - 60:57)
girlfriend and with my friends just (60:56 - 60:59)
hunting for Pokemon then they remove the (60:57 - 61:00)
tracker (60:59 - 61:04)
oh hell he did okay that made it a bit (61:00 - 61:09)
less fun and now they've put a tracker (61:04 - 61:11)
of sorts back with the Pope whenever (61:09 - 61:13)
post-op but it's still not as good as it (61:11 - 61:14)
was (61:13 - 61:18)
mm-hmm but I still enjoy it I still play (61:14 - 61:19)
it whenever I go out I have my Pokemon (61:18 - 61:21)
go Plus on I mean I'm more of a passive (61:19 - 61:23)
player than an active let's go Pokemon (61:21 - 61:26)
hunting player sure but when there's an (61:23 - 61:29)
event out then I go Pokemon hunting (61:26 - 61:32)
again okay yeah that's kind of like how (61:29 - 61:34)
I've been playing it there were rumors (61:32 - 61:37)
and I don't know if Yantic said this (61:34 - 61:40)
directly but that at one point Pokemon (61:37 - 61:43)
go would connect a Sun in moon is that (61:40 - 61:44)
something you've heard of is that (61:43 - 61:45)
something you're interested in and if (61:44 - 61:48)
they can connect how do you feel about (61:45 - 61:50)
transferring the pokémon you catch and (61:48 - 61:53)
go to a Pokemon bank or to you know a (61:50 - 61:57)
main series game alright well Masuda he (61:53 - 61:59)
did say that that was the goal (61:57 - 62:02)
originally and varrick the my friends (61:59 - 62:04)
who'd do data miner games they have (62:02 - 62:06)
showed me that there is stuff in the (62:04 - 62:09)
games text for sending pokemon or items (62:06 - 62:12)
or something from go to son of me (62:09 - 62:14)
there's a special flag saying this is (62:12 - 62:16)
from Pokemon go there's even you know (62:14 - 62:17)
how there's like four (62:16 - 62:21)
two gone for kalos native pokemon beds (62:17 - 62:23)
but clover for a lola native poke wanna (62:21 - 62:26)
make a gameboy for um reading below the (62:23 - 62:28)
Virtual Console ones yeah yeah there's (62:26 - 62:31)
also a another symbol which we believe (62:28 - 62:33)
is for Pokemon go it's kind of like a G (62:31 - 62:35)
and an O quorum (62:33 - 62:38)
remember exactly what it looks like but (62:35 - 62:40)
so I'm pretty sure something's gonna (62:38 - 62:43)
come from Pokemon go whoever it's like (62:40 - 62:46)
just say if you participate in a raid (62:43 - 62:48)
and you get mutant then you can send (62:46 - 62:51)
them you two to the main games whether (62:48 - 62:53)
it's something like that and it's really (62:51 - 62:55)
hard to tell because the mechanics of go (62:53 - 62:56)
and the mechanics of a main series games (62:55 - 62:58)
they're not really compatible and when (62:56 - 62:59)
you've got a spin-off game which (62:58 - 63:01)
connects to the main games typically (62:59 - 63:05)
it's been just give latane this Pokemon (63:01 - 63:07)
in the game send it over rather than (63:05 - 63:09)
having a Pokemon you've been training in (63:07 - 63:10)
the game and send it over so I'm not (63:09 - 63:12)
entirely sure how they're gonna do it if (63:10 - 63:13)
that's what we're gonna do and allow you (63:12 - 63:16)
to send the game Pokemon over but I know (63:13 - 63:18)
I'm not again the step it could be funny (63:16 - 63:22)
make it worth playing more yeah hunting (63:18 - 63:24)
for Pokemon we have great - there Ivy's (63:22 - 63:27)
yeah I feel like it's harder to get (63:24 - 63:29)
Pokemon Pokemon go than it would be in (63:27 - 63:31)
the main series game like as somebody (63:29 - 63:33)
who still doesn't have a Charizard and (63:31 - 63:35)
has only caught like six Charmander (63:33 - 63:38)
so I'm nowhere near getting a card (63:35 - 63:41)
Pokemon go makes Pokemon a little bit (63:38 - 63:43)
more rare even though like you can catch (63:41 - 63:46)
a million pidgeys yeah but you connected (63:43 - 63:49)
you could do that wow yeah I do wish (63:46 - 63:52)
Fred saw out there like distribution of (63:49 - 63:53)
Pokemon in the world like I know I'm not (63:52 - 63:56)
seen an unknown yet I doubt many people (63:53 - 63:59)
have seen an unknown yeah so they need (63:56 - 64:02)
to like spread it out a lot more like (63:59 - 64:04)
around here well I'm getting right now (64:02 - 64:07)
is neeti okay it's like hey I play it a (64:04 - 64:09)
lot more if there is a lot more variety (64:07 - 64:12)
now I can see why there's not variety (64:09 - 64:15)
cuz it's only up to Gen 2 once it's up (64:12 - 64:17)
to Gen 7 and I can imagine there's gonna (64:15 - 64:19)
be so much variety instead of just (64:17 - 64:21)
Pidgey everywhere we're gonna have (64:19 - 64:23)
Pidgey and Starly and fletchling yeah (64:21 - 64:25)
hickey Peck I mean that's slightly (64:23 - 64:28)
better (64:25 - 64:28)
speaking of like travelling getting (64:28 - 64:34)
out of your house Pokemon go or now (64:31 - 64:36)
Pokemon go I'm pretty sure I have my (64:34 - 64:39)
information right here you traveled to (64:36 - 64:41)
the 2016 World Championships if I'm not (64:39 - 64:44)
mistaken yeah I went on holiday last (64:41 - 64:47)
year to go to that a lot of fun you (64:44 - 64:51)
participated in in pokken yeah I (64:47 - 64:52)
participated in the last-chance (64:51 - 64:55)
qualifier for pokken and I got on stream (64:52 - 64:57)
for it and then I got completely (64:55 - 65:00)
destroyed history what wha who are you (64:57 - 65:05)
who are using as using Pikachu okay okay (65:00 - 65:07)
app and I'd come up from the losers (65:05 - 65:09)
bracket and I ended up facing against (65:07 - 65:12)
the person who was the one who put me in (65:09 - 65:15)
the loser's bracket well perfect like oh (65:12 - 65:18)
yeah I've got a good shot here yeah yeah (65:15 - 65:20)
I want to talk a little bit about you (65:18 - 65:22)
actually being at Worlds but whatever (65:20 - 65:24)
what was your thoughts on pokken I like (65:22 - 65:25)
like you said earlier this was one of (65:24 - 65:28)
the last spin-off games we got uh if (65:25 - 65:30)
it's a fun game it's really fun game I (65:28 - 65:32)
mean it might not be the most (65:30 - 65:35)
competitive fighting game around but I (65:32 - 65:37)
had a lot of fun with it I just want (65:35 - 65:40)
more of it so I want the characters (65:37 - 65:42)
which from the arcade one to be in Vee (65:40 - 65:45)
one or hopefully a switch version down (65:42 - 65:46)
the line yeah we've said on the show (65:45 - 65:49)
that we we feel like the Wii U one is is (65:46 - 65:50)
done at this point and those characters (65:49 - 65:53)
aren't coming over yeah (65:50 - 65:54)
chances are there's gonna be a switch (65:53 - 65:56)
version I mean nah there's nothing being (65:54 - 66:00)
said other than the producers of it (65:56 - 66:02)
saying that they've worked on the switch (66:00 - 66:04)
and it's like oh you [ __ ] him a switch (66:02 - 66:10)
have you before game the worlds you (66:04 - 66:12)
probably it was it was that your first (66:10 - 66:14)
time in America or have you been here (66:12 - 66:15)
before (66:14 - 66:18)
it was my first time out the UK oh wow (66:15 - 66:20)
okay so so what are your thoughts on (66:18 - 66:22)
that and then it would the world is (66:20 - 66:25)
always besides it being in Canada it's (66:22 - 66:28)
always been in the you the US so no (66:25 - 66:31)
Advan in Japan one nut and I'm not (66:28 - 66:34)
buzzing Hawaii for a few yes yeah so (66:31 - 66:38)
first time at worlds first time at us (66:34 - 66:43)
man so many questions but were what were (66:38 - 66:45)
your thoughts was it was the u.s. as (66:43 - 66:52)
TV may seem to be a little bit that I (66:45 - 66:55)
had a lot of fun I mean Wells was a lot (66:52 - 66:56)
of fun even though they had for how (66:55 - 66:59)
spectator is she which kind of dampened (66:56 - 67:00)
it for everyone (66:59 - 67:03)
you remember that Danny yeah Kier can (67:00 - 67:05)
you elaborate on that well I mean we I (67:03 - 67:07)
got like the pro I got I got I saw via (67:05 - 67:09)
Twitter and Facebook and you know (67:07 - 67:10)
hearing about that but you were there so (67:09 - 67:13)
what exactly happened with that well (67:10 - 67:17)
basically because of how the Pokemon (67:13 - 67:19)
circuit was last year they had so many (67:17 - 67:22)
people invited to Worlds and so many (67:19 - 67:24)
people turned up but they had to not (67:22 - 67:26)
allow spectators into the venue because (67:24 - 67:28)
there wasn't enough room which is very (67:26 - 67:31)
unfortunate for people who who booked is (67:28 - 67:32)
in advance (67:31 - 67:34)
thinking oh we can go to this because (67:32 - 67:36)
it's always been free and everyone's (67:34 - 67:37)
been allowed in and then that happened (67:36 - 67:41)
it was the best thing to happen but I (67:37 - 67:45)
managed get in because well you know (67:41 - 67:48)
house for [ __ ] and stuff yeah but I feel (67:45 - 67:51)
like even even if if like somebody (67:48 - 67:54)
traveled X amount I mean what was your (67:51 - 67:57)
flight like 1415 hours I was only 11 (67:54 - 68:00)
thankfully okay so still 11 hours to fly (67:57 - 68:02)
11 hours spend all that money and then (68:00 - 68:04)
to get to the door and them GAD nah (68:02 - 68:07)
don't come like they did let a handful (68:04 - 68:09)
of spectators in yeah each day they let (68:07 - 68:11)
a few in and it's just the way they (68:09 - 68:13)
handled it which was a bit iffy because (68:11 - 68:15)
they only told people like two weeks (68:13 - 68:15)
before (68:15 - 68:18)
yeah and that's like not really fair to (68:15 - 68:20)
people like if they're going to do (68:18 - 68:22)
similar this year they need to let (68:20 - 68:24)
people know soon but since it's in the (68:22 - 68:27)
Anaheim Convention Center this year then (68:24 - 68:31)
it should be fine I hope but maybe (68:27 - 68:33)
they'll have registration fees for (68:31 - 68:35)
spectators like they are having for the (68:33 - 68:36)
International Championship so it might (68:35 - 68:39)
not be free yes we talked about that (68:36 - 68:42)
earlier how it was if you're over 16 (68:39 - 68:45)
it's $15 just to spectate you have to (68:42 - 68:48)
register online so at least it with that (68:45 - 68:51)
system they're getting a head count (68:48 - 68:53)
before people are even showing up (68:51 - 68:56)
yeah that's a good thing at least and (68:53 - 68:58)
you get booster packs for it in (68:56 - 69:00)
internationals hopefully they'd do the (68:58 - 69:02)
statement they do it for Wells is that (69:00 - 69:04)
could make it worth it yeah you could (69:02 - 69:07)
pull a card which is worth $80 and it's (69:04 - 69:09)
like oh sweet I'm on (69:07 - 69:12)
so besides you know the The Spectator (69:09 - 69:15)
issue besides you know getting knocked (69:12 - 69:16)
out at the Last Chance Qualifier (69:15 - 69:21)
how was worlds we have a lot of (69:16 - 69:23)
listeners and I'm sure you have a lot of (69:21 - 69:24)
people that come to the website your (69:23 - 69:27)
website that have never been to worlds (69:24 - 69:29)
or even maybe a Nationals or a regionals (69:27 - 69:31)
like what was your thoughts on Worlds (69:29 - 69:35)
and is is that like a destination that (69:31 - 69:39)
Pokemon fans should go to oh wow well C (69:35 - 69:43)
is really still a massive tournament so (69:39 - 69:44)
there's not that much to do if you're (69:43 - 69:46)
not competing in it and obviously you (69:44 - 69:50)
need to earn your position in it so I do (69:46 - 69:52)
wish with worlds but there was more to (69:50 - 69:55)
do for the spectators I mean you can (69:52 - 69:56)
enter inside events and whatnot right (69:55 - 69:59)
that's good that's good and I would have (69:56 - 70:01)
done that but I wanted to watch all the (69:59 - 70:04)
matches so it was a lot of fun I enjoyed (70:01 - 70:07)
it and met a load of cool people and I (70:04 - 70:08)
was jet-lagged (70:07 - 70:12)
I was so jet-lagged so on the Saturday I (70:08 - 70:15)
think it was a Saturday we were just (70:12 - 70:17)
sitting in watching matches and I I mean (70:15 - 70:19)
I'm not saying it was boring it wasn't (70:17 - 70:20)
boring but I was just falling asleep (70:19 - 70:23)
because I had still not acclimatized to (70:20 - 70:27)
the time change it's just because it was (70:23 - 70:31)
like 7 p.m. in San Francisco and that's (70:27 - 70:34)
what free a.m. in the UK time I was just (70:31 - 70:38)
dead to the world how n booked lures (70:34 - 70:39)
you're Sam for the San Francisco (70:38 - 70:43)
experience like was like American food (70:39 - 70:46)
to you just extremely fatty and (70:43 - 70:49)
unhealthy compared to European food for (70:46 - 70:52)
lunch on one day I got a sandwich from (70:49 - 70:55)
one of the places at the venue and it (70:52 - 70:57)
was the thickest sandwich I have ever (70:55 - 70:59)
seen in my life it has so much meat in (70:57 - 71:01)
it I thought I was just eating a giant (70:59 - 71:05)
pig that's like that's not how you do a (71:01 - 71:06)
sandwich (71:05 - 71:10)
it was just so bizarre but I ended up (71:06 - 71:13)
eating it all but still we're so bizarre (71:10 - 71:18)
sure that when I had a scoops here (71:13 - 71:22)
joenie sandwiches and I went to a (71:18 - 71:25)
American diner which was just down the (71:22 - 71:27)
street from your venue as well that was (71:25 - 71:31)
really nice so yeah I mean I enjoyed it (71:27 - 71:33)
is are you are you planning on going to (71:31 - 71:37)
2017 worlds or or one was enough for now (71:33 - 71:40)
now I'm hoping to go I mean I've got a (71:37 - 71:43)
few obstacles to deal with first but I'm (71:40 - 71:46)
hoping that I will be there so if all (71:43 - 71:49)
goes well I will be there okay have you (71:46 - 71:52)
been doing any local or regional (71:49 - 71:53)
tournaments in your area when it comes (71:52 - 71:57)
to like Sun and Moon video Sun and Moon (71:53 - 72:00)
competition or anything else in that (71:57 - 72:03)
regards um I did go to the European (72:00 - 72:05)
international championships which were (72:03 - 72:09)
held in London in December I did compete (72:05 - 72:11)
in those but that kind of soured me on (72:09 - 72:14)
competitive for a little bit because it (72:11 - 72:17)
was held just two weeks after Sun and (72:14 - 72:19)
Moon came out I had already rushed (72:17 - 72:21)
through a game twice I needed to rush (72:19 - 72:24)
for it for a third time in order to get (72:21 - 72:28)
my for my for fun game because I always (72:24 - 72:29)
have courage game coverage game and a (72:28 - 72:32)
for fun game sure so I had to get my (72:29 - 72:35)
coverage I'm mindful fun game up to the (72:32 - 72:37)
final bits where I've got all the Zed (72:35 - 72:39)
crystals and everything just so I can (72:37 - 72:42)
probably compete and it just kind of got (72:39 - 72:44)
the fun out of it for me and it kind of (72:42 - 72:47)
soured me on this year of the video game (72:44 - 72:48)
Championships haven't really been (72:47 - 72:50)
following it as much which really sucks (72:48 - 72:52)
because I was really wanting to get into (72:50 - 72:55)
it however it changed the rule set it (72:52 - 72:57)
wasn't like nothing but legendaries like (72:55 - 72:59)
it was last year yeah I really wanted to (72:57 - 73:02)
get into it but because of how soon it (72:59 - 73:04)
was after the games it just really (73:02 - 73:07)
killed it for me but I'm starting to get (73:04 - 73:09)
back into competitive I'm actually part (73:07 - 73:11)
of them multi battle II with my (73:09 - 73:12)
girlfriends (73:11 - 73:15)
and basically we're battling a load of (73:12 - 73:17)
the prominent people in the community (73:15 - 73:19)
he'd like Google um's crafty Gameboy (73:17 - 73:22)
Luke Dunkin me deep wolfy Glick people (73:19 - 73:24)
like that a real part of it and that (73:22 - 73:27)
should bring my competitive love back I (73:24 - 73:30)
hope and you you know you're not a TCG (73:27 - 73:33)
player are you uh no not really but I've (73:30 - 73:35)
started collecting it more and more my (73:33 - 73:37)
girlfriend's a really big TCG player (73:35 - 73:39)
well she she's gotten into the TCG late (73:37 - 73:42)
be she was a VGC player she like top (73:39 - 73:44)
hate in the UK a few years back but (73:42 - 73:46)
she's moved to TCG and it's been getting (73:44 - 73:49)
me into it me I I wouldn't play it (73:46 - 73:51)
competitively because that would cost a (73:49 - 73:53)
lot of money yeah it's an expensive (73:51 - 73:58)
hobby even just collecting it here in (73:53 - 74:00)
bears like I've just spent a hundred and (73:58 - 74:02)
fifty credit what am i doing (74:00 - 74:05)
switch gears a little bit we had we had (74:02 - 74:08)
this conversation last week what I know (74:05 - 74:12)
you watched the anime yes I had some of (74:08 - 74:15)
the old anime on and I was always under (74:12 - 74:17)
the impression you can correct me if I'm (74:15 - 74:19)
wrong here that the anime is pretty (74:17 - 74:22)
accurate when it comes to Pokemon (74:19 - 74:28)
pronunciations ah we've had like we've (74:22 - 74:30)
had professor Sycamore on Jake cake I (74:28 - 74:34)
believe his name is we've had Corey from (74:30 - 74:36)
what was he from Hoenn we've had him on (74:34 - 74:39)
and both of them went on record saying (74:36 - 74:42)
that because I've asked right you have (74:39 - 74:45)
voice actors on you gotta ask like how (74:42 - 74:46)
do you say Pokemon names does like (74:45 - 74:48)
somebody standing there have like an (74:46 - 74:51)
ultimate list and they tell you you know (74:48 - 74:54)
like how are the pronunciations and both (74:51 - 74:55)
have gone on record saying like they're (74:54 - 74:58)
very particular and how you say the name (74:55 - 75:00)
when your voice acting so like okay so (74:58 - 75:03)
anyways so I had an episode on in the (75:00 - 75:07)
background and I have always known the (75:03 - 75:11)
beaver Pokemon to be Bidoof because it's (75:07 - 75:14)
B I do Oh F but the anime said B do and (75:11 - 75:16)
I was like oh I've never heard it's a (75:14 - 75:20)
Bidoof but I suppose it's Bidoof that's (75:16 - 75:24)
what the anime says and there's a not to (75:20 - 75:26)
you know bring up bubble PDF (75:24 - 75:28)
there's a article on Bubba pedia that (75:26 - 75:31)
has you know the phonetic way of saying (75:28 - 75:33)
Pokemon names and it also said Bidoof (75:31 - 75:36)
what what what is your stance on how (75:33 - 75:39)
Pokemon names are said oh well that's (75:36 - 75:43)
never really been that much of a like a (75:39 - 75:48)
reference point until 2013 when we got (75:43 - 75:52)
pokedex 3d Pro and that gave us a proper (75:48 - 75:54)
reference point for pronunciations and (75:52 - 75:57)
I'm not entirely I haven't heard it as (75:54 - 76:00)
beep do fix it yeah makers everyone says (75:57 - 76:04)
Bidoof but let me just double-check what (76:00 - 76:08)
what back game says but where is it (76:04 - 76:13)
there is yeah Bidoof huh don't know if (76:08 - 76:17)
you heard that I did I did I didn't (76:13 - 76:19)
think that I know there's a there's a (76:17 - 76:21)
there's like a handbook out there that (76:19 - 76:23)
you can like buy a Barnes & Noble that (76:21 - 76:25)
does have like the phonetic spelling in (76:23 - 76:28)
it says official handbook who knows what (76:25 - 76:29)
if it's official or not I guess my (76:28 - 76:32)
question though is if you're talking (76:29 - 76:35)
with somebody and they say Rayquaza or (76:32 - 76:38)
they say rayquaza or they say sighs or (76:35 - 76:42)
or they say scizor or Bidoof or Bidoof (76:38 - 76:44)
where's your stance look do you correct (76:42 - 76:46)
the person or do you just like hey it's (76:44 - 76:48)
a Pokemon II I know what you're saying (76:46 - 76:50)
like where where's your stance on that (76:48 - 76:52)
for my spot I'm like I know what you're (76:50 - 76:55)
saying but whenever someone doesn't (76:52 - 76:57)
pronounce one particular Pokemon (76:55 - 77:00)
correctly because nobody really does (76:57 - 77:03)
look just a specific Pokemon I always (77:00 - 77:04)
bring it up because it's hilarious (77:03 - 77:07)
because it's the most convoluted way of (77:04 - 77:08)
saying it (77:07 - 77:11)
it's the Pokemon illumi they can't even (77:08 - 77:13)
as most people make would pronounce it (77:11 - 77:15)
illumise yeah (77:13 - 77:19)
illumise or illumise but it's you me say (77:15 - 77:21)
that's just the most ridiculous one I (77:19 - 77:23)
have ever heard and I always bring it up (77:21 - 77:25)
whenever someone mispronounce edge to (77:23 - 77:27)
say actually that's called Illume easy (77:25 - 77:29)
for everything else I just let slide (77:27 - 77:31)
because even though there's strict on it (77:29 - 77:32)
now there have been so many (77:31 - 77:35)
pronunciations as specific of various (77:32 - 77:39)
Pokemon like Arceus has been Arceus yes (77:35 - 77:40)
officially as well (77:39 - 77:42)
and like there's Tropius and Tropius (77:40 - 77:45)
have both been used right yeah and I've (77:42 - 77:48)
heard the anime hasn't always been the (77:45 - 77:51)
most accurate but again I get again I'd (77:48 - 77:53)
have to ask some more voice actors like (77:51 - 77:55)
where are you getting your source (77:53 - 77:58)
material here there is another one which (77:55 - 78:02)
I am kind of set on and it's porygon Zed (77:58 - 78:05)
not porygon Z all right I did hear you (78:02 - 78:09)
earlier say Zed crystals yep I am very (78:05 - 78:13)
British this is what has to be done plus (78:09 - 78:18)
technically in Japan it's like zet or so (78:13 - 78:21)
debt so is that okay okay (78:18 - 78:27)
so yeah the British may be more British (78:21 - 78:31)
um you do all the Pokemon news shuffle (78:27 - 78:35)
anime main series Game pot hacking as (78:31 - 78:37)
somebody who runs arguably the biggest (78:35 - 78:41)
Pokemon site out there do you also keep (78:37 - 78:45)
tabs on other Pokemon fan sites (78:41 - 78:48)
youtubers podcasters you know twitch (78:45 - 78:51)
streamers are you watching all those two (78:48 - 78:54)
on top of the news or for the most part (78:51 - 78:56)
you just you know you just do what you (78:54 - 78:58)
do and kind of ignore the rest so the (78:56 - 79:00)
most part I do keep to myself I mean I (78:58 - 79:02)
try to stay away from other websites but (79:00 - 79:04)
has been drama in the past although I'm (79:02 - 79:05)
good friends with a lot of website (79:04 - 79:08)
owners now when let's do a couple who (79:05 - 79:10)
I'm not friends with and you can (79:08 - 79:14)
probably guess who they are but for the (79:10 - 79:16)
most part on good terms and I'm friends (79:14 - 79:18)
with a lot of the Pokemon youtubers I (79:16 - 79:20)
mean I tried to watch as much as I can (79:18 - 79:24)
but my times limited but and I tried to (79:20 - 79:26)
stay on top of it as much as possible in (79:24 - 79:28)
the fandom I mean I used to not really (79:26 - 79:31)
do that [ __ ] I used to just be me and (79:28 - 79:32)
I used to not pay attention to anything (79:31 - 79:35)
but recently over the last few years (79:32 - 79:37)
basically since we lost both I've been (79:35 - 79:39)
getting out there I've been going to (79:37 - 79:42)
events more I've been putting myself out (79:39 - 79:44)
there more I've been meeting people I've (79:42 - 79:45)
been getting to know a lot of the other (79:44 - 79:47)
prominent people in the community and I (79:45 - 79:50)
think it's a lot better that way because (79:47 - 79:53)
we're a community army yeah yeah and (79:50 - 79:57)
so I shut myself out I kind of segmented (79:53 - 79:59)
for community and I didn't like that (79:57 - 80:02)
nice like being friends with people and (79:59 - 80:06)
so so I keep trying to keep on top of (80:02 - 80:09)
everything but possible yeah I think the (80:06 - 80:12)
Pokemon community was so different you (80:09 - 80:15)
know five six years ago and I've tried (80:12 - 80:19)
to reach out to you know every Pokemon (80:15 - 80:22)
site whether that's set you or Bob pedia (80:19 - 80:26)
or pokey Beach or you know poke a jungle (80:22 - 80:28)
there's so many out there and for the (80:26 - 80:30)
most part everyone has been really nice (80:28 - 80:31)
there's still a couple sites that you (80:30 - 80:34)
know why would I want to be at a Pokemon (80:31 - 80:36)
podcast uh okay you know that's cool you (80:34 - 80:39)
don't have to just Wow what's I mean who (80:36 - 80:43)
would say that I would say only shame (80:39 - 80:46)
from name and shame them I will say that (80:43 - 80:47)
conversation might have been with pokey (80:46 - 80:49)
Beach I was like hey you want to be out (80:47 - 80:51)
and it was like why would I want to wow (80:49 - 80:54)
I don't know man to talk about Pokemon (80:51 - 80:58)
you do good work I'm not gonna like say (80:54 - 81:00)
your site's not great it's great for TCG (80:58 - 81:02)
stuff no I've only had a lot I've only (81:00 - 81:04)
had good conversations with people in (81:02 - 81:06)
the community that got a nice community (81:04 - 81:08)
yeah that conversation with pokey Beach (81:06 - 81:10)
was like was like four or five years ago (81:08 - 81:12)
so uh maybe I'll ask him again but (81:10 - 81:14)
everyone seems nice everyone seems great (81:12 - 81:18)
for like you the youtubers and like the (81:14 - 81:19)
twitch streamers and stuff like there (81:18 - 81:21)
are there a lot of big ones out there (81:19 - 81:23)
shiny streamers competitive streamers (81:21 - 81:26)
Wolfie Glee coz is obviously really big (81:23 - 81:28)
when it comes to the video game I've (81:26 - 81:30)
actually talked in and battled with him (81:28 - 81:33)
at Nationals before he was incredibly (81:30 - 81:35)
nice I've interviewed Aaron Zhang (81:33 - 81:39)
also a great competitive battler for (81:35 - 81:42)
what you do obviously as somebody who (81:39 - 81:44)
runs the biggest Pokemon website have (81:42 - 81:47)
you thought about doing YouTube or (81:44 - 81:49)
twitch or anything like that or do you (81:47 - 81:51)
just not have the time or you are you (81:49 - 81:53)
just not interested in being on camera (81:51 - 81:55)
and it's really more of a time thing I (81:53 - 81:57)
have done a few twitch streams whenever (81:55 - 81:59)
there's been a demo or for a Pokemon (81:57 - 82:01)
game like this Pokemon Sun and Moon demo (81:59 - 82:03)
back in October when it came out I did a (82:01 - 82:04)
stream for that (82:03 - 82:07)
and like other said daily I'm doing that (82:04 - 82:09)
multi battle league with other youtubers (82:07 - 82:11)
and prominent people when Matt's on (82:09 - 82:14)
YouTube but I don't really have the time (82:11 - 82:16)
to be like the other youtubers and do (82:14 - 82:19)
like massive Let's Plays and research (82:16 - 82:21)
loads of videos like theories and stuff (82:19 - 82:23)
like that I really don't have the time (82:21 - 82:25)
for that because the site takes up so (82:23 - 82:27)
much time I mean so many people think Oh (82:25 - 82:30)
Jerry he doesn't do much he just rolls (82:27 - 82:31)
out of bed and updates his side's and (82:30 - 82:35)
hates games it's like I do so much have (82:31 - 82:37)
to always be alert I have to always have (82:35 - 82:39)
my laptop with me just in case something (82:37 - 82:42)
drops when I'm out right so it's such (82:39 - 82:45)
hard work it takes a lot of time I mean (82:42 - 82:48)
I don't really remember last time (82:45 - 82:50)
actually had a day off now I know I know (82:48 - 82:53)
with no I don't think anyone that would (82:50 - 82:56)
debate that Serbia's is easily one of (82:53 - 82:58)
the first if not always the first when (82:56 - 83:01)
it comes to Pokemon news and that just (82:58 - 83:03)
speaks to the amount of work you do and (83:01 - 83:07)
how dedicated you are but and I don't I (83:03 - 83:09)
don't have any specific examples but (83:07 - 83:12)
let's say for example you know this site (83:09 - 83:15)
site XYZ is doing something better than (83:12 - 83:17)
you is that something you consider of (83:15 - 83:21)
like oh how they I don't know like lay (83:17 - 83:23)
out their Pokemon like looks better or (83:21 - 83:26)
hey how they address this shuffle (83:23 - 83:27)
information is better maybe I should (83:26 - 83:29)
adopt that maybe I should change that is (83:27 - 83:30)
it is there anything like that that (83:29 - 83:33)
seems to cross your mind of like I'm (83:30 - 83:34)
gonna take inspiration from this because (83:33 - 83:36)
they are doing it right and I want I (83:34 - 83:38)
want Sarah B to be the best it can be (83:36 - 83:41)
the only thing which is kind of like (83:38 - 83:43)
that is for mobile layout which I've (83:41 - 83:45)
been working on for the last two years I (83:43 - 83:49)
was so close to getting it right but CSS (83:45 - 83:51)
is just a horrible monster to work with (83:49 - 83:53)
anyone who's run a web site would know (83:51 - 83:55)
this yes it's just getting it so it (83:53 - 83:57)
looks great on a desktop and it looks (83:55 - 84:00)
great on mobile is always a tricky (83:57 - 84:03)
tricky thing because so many sites (84:00 - 84:05)
nowadays they go for a mobile layout and (84:03 - 84:10)
it looks like complete on desktop mm-hmm (84:05 - 84:13)
it looks really good on desktop but it's (84:10 - 84:16)
unusable on mobile yeah and so I'm (84:13 - 84:17)
trying to forget the right balance I (84:16 - 84:18)
think (84:17 - 84:20)
I've got it but there's just massive it (84:18 - 84:23)
issue good to stopping me from doing but (84:20 - 84:25)
once that's done then the site will load (84:23 - 84:28)
better on mobile and you won't have to (84:25 - 84:29)
swipe it (84:28 - 84:32)
swipe to zoom it which I know is a bit (84:29 - 84:34)
annoying for people yeah that's the only (84:32 - 84:38)
root thing I mean in the past I had been (84:34 - 84:41)
complacent with how I did things on the (84:38 - 84:44)
site and that's when Baba pedia started (84:41 - 84:47)
showing up ad side getting popular and (84:44 - 84:51)
that really caused me to just think okay (84:47 - 84:54)
I actually have to put more effort in (84:51 - 84:57)
really and that's when I started doing (84:54 - 85:00)
things like the pokeo section and the (84:57 - 85:03)
item database which I have and so many (85:00 - 85:06)
people say what amazing resources they (85:03 - 85:08)
are so I definitely did a good thing so (85:06 - 85:10)
it was good to get a nice kick up the (85:08 - 85:12)
butt right a little competition made (85:10 - 85:15)
Guerra be better yeah you know 100 100 (85:12 - 85:18)
some episodes ago we talked about a new (85:15 - 85:22)
snus Arabi and you said you were working (85:18 - 85:24)
at it you kind of mentioned that you (85:22 - 85:26)
know you're working on a mobile view but (85:24 - 85:29)
is there is there still a more updated (85:26 - 85:33)
modern Sarah be in the works and I don't (85:29 - 85:36)
I don't mean to throw rocks but some (85:33 - 85:39)
would argue that Sarah B looks like a (85:36 - 85:42)
website from 1989 oh come on it's (85:39 - 85:45)
because I'm from 2004 okay alright (85:42 - 85:49)
alright well basically the way I see it (85:45 - 85:52)
is website design is cyclical so in a (85:49 - 85:54)
year or two my layout will be cool again (85:52 - 85:56)
and people won't care there you go (85:54 - 85:58)
it's like when you're in it's like when (85:56 - 86:00)
you play pokemon red/blue as a there's a (85:58 - 86:02)
ten year old and then when you get to (86:00 - 86:04)
college it's good again yet but (86:02 - 86:07)
seriously both like design at the moment (86:04 - 86:10)
the standards for website design is not (86:07 - 86:13)
really applicable to websites with a lot (86:10 - 86:15)
of content because it's so hard to get (86:13 - 86:17)
navigation right when you've got a lot (86:15 - 86:20)
of content yes yes so sites would either (86:17 - 86:23)
just go with a search or they would just (86:20 - 86:25)
have like 12 pages and for a site (86:23 - 86:28)
besides therapy which has got like seven (86:25 - 86:31)
hundred thousand pages (86:28 - 86:34)
to have specific navigation and like the (86:31 - 86:37)
free column layout I know it's not ideal (86:34 - 86:40)
because you have to search things I mean (86:37 - 86:41)
there is a search on the site if you (86:40 - 86:43)
want to use it yeah I know it's pretty (86:41 - 86:45)
well I mean it's Google you can't go (86:43 - 86:48)
wrong with Google but having things on (86:45 - 86:50)
the left and then things on the right is (86:48 - 86:52)
the only really only way to really have (86:50 - 86:53)
so much content on the site and I try to (86:52 - 86:55)
make sure everything is findable within (86:53 - 86:59)
free clicks on another page and that is (86:55 - 87:01)
one of the ten poles of website design (86:59 - 87:04)
everything has to be findable with (87:01 - 87:06)
preferably without a search within free (87:04 - 87:08)
clicks mm hmm and that's why I've got on (87:06 - 87:10)
so a bead on net and the new layout (87:08 - 87:12)
currently looks exactly the same on (87:10 - 87:14)
desktop I'm not going to lie but I (87:12 - 87:16)
needed to get the functionality right (87:14 - 87:18)
before I started fiddling with looks (87:16 - 87:21)
right yeah you wouldn't want to like (87:18 - 87:22)
make it look good and then all of a (87:21 - 87:24)
sudden all your work and mobile has to (87:22 - 87:27)
be redone yeah and the plan is basically (87:24 - 87:29)
for it to look similar to where it does (87:27 - 87:32)
now bit of a big a fun bit more padding (87:29 - 87:34)
and that should make everything look (87:32 - 87:35)
fine (87:34 - 87:37)
although I did do some tests and bigger (87:35 - 87:40)
font makes it look cluttered so I have (87:37 - 87:42)
to kind of get the balance right and (87:40 - 87:44)
that's the hardest thing and whenever I (87:42 - 87:46)
start making headway on something they (87:44 - 87:48)
say and a new pokemon game is announced (87:46 - 87:50)
I'm like oh yeah (87:48 - 87:52)
where where goes back projects right I (87:50 - 87:55)
guess I'll see it in another six months (87:52 - 87:57)
yeah (87:55 - 88:00)
because Sarah B dotnet is pretty much (87:57 - 88:03)
just me I mean other sites they have (88:00 - 88:05)
huge team and I know Bubba pedia because (88:03 - 88:07)
it's so used to but edited thing like (88:05 - 88:10)
there's a huge team of staff and it has (88:07 - 88:14)
just fans editing this the Derby dotnet (88:10 - 88:16)
is pretty much me have my friends who (88:14 - 88:17)
data mine which really helps with (88:16 - 88:20)
pokedex and I've got translators and the (88:17 - 88:22)
Pokemon of a weak writer but everything (88:20 - 88:25)
else it's me when you go to a section (88:22 - 88:26)
like the Sun immune section I have (88:25 - 88:29)
written every single page which is on (88:26 - 88:33)
that myself okay that's why things might (88:29 - 88:35)
not be updated so fast that's why if (88:33 - 88:36)
there's an error it's probably not been (88:35 - 88:38)
caught and people need to email me this (88:36 - 88:40)
is a one-man show (88:38 - 88:43)
sure so we are we brought our pokey (88:40 - 88:45)
Beach earlier and again (88:43 - 88:48)
I'm sure he's a nice guy I do know that (88:45 - 88:52)
he hired some help and they they had a (88:48 - 88:55)
site kinda that was similar to you that (88:52 - 88:58)
kind of like 2004 look and then I know (88:55 - 89:00)
you hired some people and they updated (88:58 - 89:01)
their site and it looks the way it does (89:00 - 89:04)
now I think it looks slightly different (89:01 - 89:06)
than originally what he launched it but (89:04 - 89:09)
have you ever considered like hiring (89:06 - 89:12)
another coder a backing code or even (89:09 - 89:13)
maybe a front-end coder just to like (89:12 - 89:17)
help accelerate that project um a couple (89:13 - 89:20)
of times yeah but I'm very stubborn I'm (89:17 - 89:22)
an old man set in my ways I'm like if I (89:20 - 89:25)
can't do it no one will do it sure (89:22 - 89:27)
sometimes that you kind of just want it (89:25 - 89:30)
off your plate yeah I mean I have spoken (89:27 - 89:33)
to a few people about trying to work out (89:30 - 89:35)
the issue the issue I've got with the (89:33 - 89:39)
current River meal out but it's (89:35 - 89:43)
basically looking like it's impossible (89:39 - 89:45)
we'll CSS it's impossible to do what I (89:43 - 89:47)
wanted to do so I need to you know (89:45 - 89:50)
recode CSS to do what I wanted to do yes (89:47 - 89:52)
yes the site CSS I'm talking about the (89:50 - 89:56)
language yeah it's it's quite a language (89:52 - 90:00)
is uh just just a couple more questions (89:56 - 90:04)
here uh we now have the switch uh okay (90:00 - 90:08)
the 3ds is you know 200 years old at (90:04 - 90:09)
this point (90:08 - 90:12)
what are your thoughts of this this (90:09 - 90:14)
rumor going around that Pokemon stars (90:12 - 90:16)
exist on the switch it was reported by (90:14 - 90:18)
Eurogamer that's you know that's people (90:16 - 90:21)
from your country (90:18 - 90:21)
I think it's definitely possible but I (90:25 - 90:30)
don't see them jumping straight I mean I (90:27 - 90:33)
can see them going on to switch soon but (90:30 - 90:35)
I can't see even going exclusively to (90:33 - 90:37)
switch if they are going to make the (90:35 - 90:40)
jump inside generation seven then I (90:37 - 90:43)
can't see even doing anything but having (90:40 - 90:45)
it be a cross generation game and having (90:43 - 90:48)
a free ds3 and a switch release oh okay (90:45 - 90:51)
I don't like I've ever heard anyone like (90:48 - 90:53)
pitch that concept I think that's the (90:51 - 90:55)
only way they can do it because (90:53 - 90:57)
otherwise they're segmenting their user (90:55 - 91:01)
base or they're annoying 66 million (90:57 - 91:03)
people who are free Diaz's that compared (91:01 - 91:05)
to the three billion people who have (91:03 - 91:08)
switches right now yeah basically they (91:05 - 91:11)
have to do this right I mean I'm (91:08 - 91:13)
expecting a free Deus game next no (91:11 - 91:15)
matter what regardless of if stars is (91:13 - 91:18)
real do you think we're getting like a (91:15 - 91:20)
third version though I mean we didn't we (91:18 - 91:22)
didn't get Z even though you know people (91:20 - 91:24)
say that Z was being worked on I don't (91:22 - 91:26)
know if if you had any sources that said (91:24 - 91:29)
differently I mean we got a weed in (91:26 - 91:32)
getting a car outside mom we didn't get (91:29 - 91:34)
anything for x and y we got a sequel to (91:32 - 91:36)
black and white like we haven't had a (91:34 - 91:41)
third version since 2008 yeah um I think (91:36 - 91:44)
it's possible they wouldn't be like a (91:41 - 91:47)
generic fair version like platinum was (91:44 - 91:49)
like emerald was because gang freak 1 to (91:47 - 91:52)
surprise us and so doing what's expected (91:49 - 91:55)
next would be not surprising us (91:52 - 91:57)
so whether we've got a third version (91:55 - 92:00)
every got diamond depower remakes (91:57 - 92:02)
whether we've got a nice equal second (92:00 - 92:04)
canto whether we've just got something (92:02 - 92:07)
bizarrely new in an in a new region (92:04 - 92:10)
without new Pokemon I think they're (92:07 - 92:11)
going to surprise us it's hard to say (92:10 - 92:14)
right now I mean I'd like that Nepal (92:11 - 92:16)
remakes because alright now I'm starting (92:14 - 92:18)
to feel nostalgic about it yeah which (92:16 - 92:20)
makes me sad because I was in my final (92:18 - 92:22)
year of university when Rhodes came out (92:20 - 92:24)
and I was covering them and that's like (92:22 - 92:27)
oh god I'm nostalgic that when I was at (92:24 - 92:32)
university oh my god would you would you (92:27 - 92:34)
want a sweater ocean though like is that (92:32 - 92:37)
something you'd look for like if if they (92:34 - 92:39)
if they did what you said if they'd (92:37 - 92:42)
in a 3ds and a switch version I feel (92:39 - 92:43)
like you'd buy both just because you'd (92:42 - 92:46)
have to but would you want it on switch (92:43 - 92:47)
would you want to play it on switch uh (92:46 - 92:49)
sure why not (92:47 - 92:52)
I mean it's a it's a portable device and (92:49 - 92:54)
that's the key thing about Pokemon (92:52 - 92:55)
that's why Pokemon hasn't been on a home (92:54 - 92:57)
console yet because it would lose for (92:55 - 93:01)
portal aspect we have no benefits so it (92:57 - 93:03)
would do everything it can do on the 3ds (93:01 - 93:06)
and cept it can also be played on the TV (93:03 - 93:08)
so I'll be fine with a switch version (93:06 - 93:12)
and the images people think you know (93:08 - 93:13)
have done stuff which they probably (93:12 - 93:15)
shouldn't have who has made the game's (93:13 - 93:18)
render at 1080p it makes for games with (93:15 - 93:20)
gorgeous just thrown some new textures (93:18 - 93:24)
in yeah and it would be amazing I mean (93:20 - 93:26)
that's another thing which makes me (93:24 - 93:28)
think about it not moving to switch yet (93:26 - 93:30)
though because people would be expecting (93:28 - 93:32)
like this massive overhaul they'd be (93:30 - 93:34)
expecting always can be like Zelda it (93:32 - 93:36)
can be like xenoblade chronicles it's (93:34 - 93:38)
like no it wouldn't it would be Sun and (93:36 - 93:41)
Moon in high def assembly in terms of (93:38 - 93:43)
the engine and that would probably (93:41 - 93:46)
dishearten people a bit see I'm uh I I (93:43 - 93:47)
would love that (93:46 - 93:50)
yeah I'd personally be absolutely fine (93:47 - 93:52)
with it but I know a lot of people would (93:50 - 93:54)
be saying oh god this hasn't evolved at (93:52 - 93:54)
all (93:54 - 93:57)
yes yes they wouldn't do until (93:54 - 93:58)
generation 8 that's why before you're a (93:57 - 94:00)
gamer a rumor happened does like are (93:58 - 94:02)
thinking okay I'll probably move to (94:00 - 94:04)
switch but not until generation a in (94:02 - 94:09)
2019 and so I know basically whatever (94:04 - 94:11)
they are doing next if I'm moving to (94:09 - 94:13)
switch we have to be careful with how we (94:11 - 94:16)
do it they have to make sure they don't (94:13 - 94:17)
cut off their user base they have to (94:16 - 94:19)
make sure everything works fine they (94:17 - 94:22)
have to make sure it looks nice but the (94:19 - 94:24)
models look nice now anyway funding (94:22 - 94:26)
that's why the games don't run so well (94:24 - 94:29)
on the 3ds the models are too good yeah (94:26 - 94:30)
yeah that was and that was what kind of (94:29 - 94:32)
one of my complaints about Sun and Moon (94:30 - 94:34)
is how can Game Freak which you know (94:32 - 94:37)
they're not they're not a first-party (94:34 - 94:39)
developer but come on they make they (94:37 - 94:41)
make the Pokemon games but how can how (94:39 - 94:45)
can Game Freak make a game that runs so (94:41 - 94:49)
poorly on the new 3ds like it just kind (94:45 - 94:52)
of boggles my mind that that they (94:49 - 94:54)
you could have either you know made some (94:52 - 94:56)
changes to make it run smoothly what (94:54 - 94:58)
whatever the changes those had to be or (94:56 - 95:00)
they had something bigger in mind which (94:58 - 95:02)
kind of that kind of always stuck out to (95:00 - 95:04)
me why I like that Eurogamer kind of (95:02 - 95:05)
seemed like okay I can believe that (95:04 - 95:08)
and and like you said it's very easy to (95:05 - 95:10)
turn those model even though you (95:08 - 95:11)
shouldn't it's very easy to turn those (95:10 - 95:13)
models into 1080p and make them look (95:11 - 95:16)
great yeah and another thing which which (95:13 - 95:18)
makes me think maybe you're a gamer (95:16 - 95:21)
right about it is the waiver Sun and (95:18 - 95:23)
Moon kind of ditches the hole to screen (95:21 - 95:25)
thing I mean it never uses both screens (95:23 - 95:28)
vitally at the same time it's always one (95:25 - 95:29)
or the other (95:28 - 95:31)
yeah and then there's the whole removal (95:29 - 95:33)
for PSS and replacement with festival (95:31 - 95:35)
Plaza and its own weird friendless I (95:33 - 95:38)
mean but if that's not set preparing for (95:35 - 95:41)
like a switch compatibility I don't know (95:38 - 95:42)
what is yeah (95:41 - 95:45)
because it's so separate from how the (95:42 - 95:49)
3ds would work and it's so and it feels (95:45 - 95:51)
like a step back from the PSS because (95:49 - 95:53)
the PSS was perfect for a dual screen (95:51 - 95:57)
device so that made me think maybe the (95:53 - 96:00)
gyro game arena is correct maybe it will (95:57 - 96:03)
be on switch next maybe yeah (96:00 - 96:05)
yeah I mean I feel like I trust your (96:03 - 96:08)
word more than anyone's if anyone knows (96:05 - 96:10)
place is not a confirmation this is not (96:08 - 96:12)
a confirmation you heard it here first (96:10 - 96:17)
don't be so mean mass confer so I got (96:12 - 96:20)
like two more questions one is very (96:17 - 96:23)
important why do people take such bad (96:20 - 96:26)
screenshots of magazines and send them (96:23 - 96:27)
to you (96:26 - 96:30)
well they don't really send them to me I (96:27 - 96:33)
find them people who leak coracoid we (96:30 - 96:36)
tend to do it anonymously around the (96:33 - 96:40)
internet in Japan and scanning it is (96:36 - 96:44)
legally iffy and so dodgy pictures (96:40 - 96:46)
really the only way to do it and even (96:44 - 96:49)
then it's like questionable (96:46 - 96:51)
it's like 2017 we all have cell phones (96:49 - 96:54)
we are cameras on her cell phone take a (96:51 - 96:58)
good picture guys come on but it's part (96:54 - 97:00)
of what makes the hype season exciting (96:58 - 97:02)
isn't it that's true something about (97:00 - 97:05)
like a badly taken photo where like half (97:02 - 97:05)
the jet (97:05 - 97:09)
and his copy is unreadable and yeah let (97:05 - 97:11)
me come on guys I just want to know what (97:09 - 97:16)

intended use of casein it is the slow (102:53 - 102:57)
digesting protein so you take it before (102:55 - 102:59)
you go to bed so it digests all night (102:57 - 103:00)
while you're asleep and then you take it (102:59 - 103:02)
when you first wake up in the morning so (103:00 - 103:04)
it suggests all day gotcha (103:02 - 103:08)
also Micah we do hate when people say oh (103:04 - 103:11)
you live in Long Island it is an actual (103:08 - 103:14)
Island so we live on it Rhode Island is (103:11 - 103:16)
just the state so you live in it mimei (103:14 - 103:18)
to it my main reason for writing in (103:16 - 103:21)
today was to address closed pocus tops (103:18 - 103:23)
on Easter Sunday my girlfriend and I (103:21 - 103:25)
went to the grandparents house on in (103:23 - 103:29)
sorry in Rye New York like the brown (103:25 - 103:32)
talked about Will Anderson hometown (103:29 - 103:34)
dude I grew up in Port Chester shout out (103:32 - 103:37)
we went on I want you guys go on yeah (103:34 - 103:40)
yeah we went on a walk on the boardwalk (103:37 - 103:42)
a couple blocks away and of course I (103:40 - 103:43)
opened Pokemon go to see if there was (103:42 - 103:46)
any stops gyms or Pokemon I wouldn't (103:43 - 103:49)
commonly see on Long Island every stop (103:46 - 103:52)
that was a store or monument on the (103:49 - 103:55)
boardwalk was closed and I was confused (103:52 - 103:58)
because it seemed because it wasn't the (103:55 - 104:00)
season to technically be at the beach (103:58 - 104:02)
but the to poke stops at the main gate (104:00 - 104:03)
were not closed which kind of confused (104:02 - 104:06)
me why every poke is stopped behind the (104:03 - 104:09)
main gate why close every poka stop (104:06 - 104:11)
behind the main gate just wanted to (104:09 - 104:13)
inform you guys that it is happening in (104:11 - 104:16)
other areas of the country sorry for the (104:13 - 104:17)
longest email my daughter and I really (104:16 - 104:20)
enjoy the podcast shout-out to Anthony's (104:17 - 104:23)
daughter thanks for all your hard work (104:20 - 104:25)
on the podcast and mythical you are all (104:23 - 104:27)
my favorite by the way SBG (104:25 - 104:29)
a little bit more since the podcast (104:27 - 104:31)
wouldn't exist without him (104:29 - 104:34)
Anthony so I'm surprised because the (104:31 - 104:36)
boardwalk at ripe Leyland which is what (104:34 - 104:38)
he's talking about you that never closes (104:36 - 104:40)
I when I was in high school we used to (104:38 - 104:42)
go there like during lunch in the middle (104:40 - 104:45)
of the winter and hang out so like it's (104:42 - 104:47)
not I mean it is in a park and (104:45 - 104:49)
technically it's a public park but it (104:47 - 104:50)
doesn't close (104:49 - 104:52)
I mean closes at night but not during (104:50 - 104:53)
the daytime so that's really weird that (104:52 - 104:55)
the pokey stops would have been closed (104:53 - 104:58)
during that time like Playland Park is (104:55 - 105:00)
closed which is a amusement park but the (104:58 - 105:03)
boardwalk part is always open it's where (105:00 - 105:05)
they filmed big I'm throwing out all my (105:03 - 105:07)
facts all at once I appreciate it all (105:05 - 105:09)
effect yeah I don't know I was there I (105:07 - 105:10)
was there the night they filmed that (105:09 - 105:13)
part of big really that's a story for (105:10 - 105:15)
another time oh man I need to hear that (105:13 - 105:16)
story (105:15 - 105:18)
another time I don't know why why it (105:16 - 105:20)
would be closed but it is good to hear (105:18 - 105:23)
that you know Milwaukee is not the only (105:20 - 105:25)
one city in the world where things are (105:23 - 105:28)
Oh closing we're there things are (105:25 - 105:31)
closing I listen to 60 DB and they (105:28 - 105:34)
actually had an article on about the (105:31 - 105:36)
Milwaukee parks shutting down and (105:34 - 105:38)
closing the stops and everything in the (105:36 - 105:40)
lawsuit that's going on so it's becoming (105:38 - 105:42)
more national you're gonna make national (105:40 - 105:46)
news dude is it not cut local man local (105:42 - 105:49)
man hey this is Pokemon go and has a (105:46 - 105:52)
podcast is it not common everywhere else (105:49 - 105:55)
outside of Wisconsin that parks close at (105:52 - 105:57)
a certain time of night no no they do (105:55 - 106:00)
they do okay the whole the whole thing (105:57 - 106:04)
about the the lawsuit in the city and (106:00 - 106:07)
everything made trying to tell the (106:04 - 106:08)
Niantic to close down the stops that (106:07 - 106:12)
part is making national news yeah yeah (106:08 - 106:14)
yeah Centennial Park in Atlanta when I (106:12 - 106:17)
went that closed at 10:00 but there are (106:14 - 106:21)
that was that was like the first two (106:17 - 106:23)
weeks of Pokemon go and there was still (106:21 - 106:24)
hundreds of people in the park after (106:23 - 106:28)
10:00 and didn't didn't care breaking (106:24 - 106:29)
the law we didn't talk about this in (106:28 - 106:33)
news but with the last Pokemon go update (106:29 - 106:37)
there was some recent changes to the API (106:33 - 106:39)
to make it (106:37 - 106:41)
I don't know how to word this without (106:39 - 106:43)
being like wrong in some extent pretty (106:41 - 106:46)
much it made it seem that knee antic is (106:43 - 106:50)
setting up the platform that Pokemon go (106:46 - 106:54)
is based on to license that platform out (106:50 - 106:58)
so that other games could do what (106:54 - 107:01)
Pokemon go does like a couple months ago (106:58 - 107:05)
we heard about like a Harry Potter go ah (107:01 - 107:09)
with recent changes to the API it's like (107:05 - 107:11)
more obvious that that is what they're (107:09 - 107:14)
getting ready to do so to go back to (107:11 - 107:17)
will story about how Milwaukee will (107:14 - 107:19)
continue to be in the news about this is (107:17 - 107:23)
because if Niantic license out the (107:19 - 107:24)
platform to other companies (107:23 - 107:28)
there will be more AR games which would (107:24 - 107:31)
then go back to them continuing to fight (107:28 - 107:34)
with Milwaukee and probably other cities (107:31 - 107:37)
and states right it's only a matter of (107:34 - 107:38)
time when something does as well as (107:37 - 107:41)
Pokemon did Pokemon go did before (107:38 - 107:43)
there's a million versions of it I'm (107:41 - 107:46)
sure knee antic would love to make money (107:43 - 107:48)
off a Harry Potter ago and just (107:46 - 107:50)
absolutely license that to somebody and (107:48 - 107:54)
just take twenty percent or however much (107:50 - 107:56)
they take and continue doing what (107:54 - 108:00)
they're doing this message is from Henry (107:56 - 108:03)
from Irvine California (108:00 - 108:06)
hey SP J's and others just wanted to say (108:03 - 108:08)
how much I like your podcast and I have (108:06 - 108:10)
a couple questions one what are the (108:08 - 108:13)
origins of the podcast and two what (108:10 - 108:15)
pokemon remake would you like to see and (108:13 - 108:17)
three what is your favorite game on (108:15 - 108:20)
Nintendo switch Travis is my favorite (108:17 - 108:23)
SBJ is close behind hashtag Travis for (108:20 - 108:26)
good Henry will doesn't have a switch (108:23 - 108:28)
correct (108:26 - 108:29)
Michael what's your favorite game on (108:28 - 108:31)
switch I real quick just want to point (108:29 - 108:33)
out that that was a call out to a (108:31 - 108:36)
hashtag that we that we made on Twitter (108:33 - 108:39)
where what was trending was hashtag (108:36 - 108:42)
travel for good and I misread it as (108:39 - 108:45)
Travis for good and I'm really happy (108:42 - 108:49)
that somebody remembers that uh uh what (108:45 - 108:51)
was the question favorite favorite game (108:49 - 108:53)
on switch Mario Kart right now (108:51 - 108:56)
Elda is my favorite zelda of all time so (108:53 - 108:57)
I feel like that's probably going to be (108:56 - 108:59)
my favorite switch game for a very long (108:57 - 109:04)
time uh as a switch owner I also enjoyed (108:59 - 109:08)
Zelda I am currently playing cuida Priya (109:04 - 109:12)
Tetris which is a superior game compared (109:08 - 109:14)
to most games on switch especially a (109:12 - 109:16)
game called mario kart 8 (109:14 - 109:19)
let me rant real quick about this these (109:16 - 109:21)
games came out the same week one being (109:19 - 109:23)
brand new unless you imported it from (109:21 - 109:26)
Japan the other one being a three year (109:23 - 109:30)
old game one being $60 and also three (109:26 - 109:34)
years old one being brand new and $30 (109:30 - 109:37)
why did people make the wrong decision (109:34 - 109:39)
in life and not hit aruhya piya Tetris I (109:37 - 109:43)
had a really hard time justifying buying (109:39 - 109:46)
Mario Kart after I went on a Twitter (109:43 - 109:48)
rant saying pretty much everything you (109:46 - 109:50)
just said and more about how terrible of (109:48 - 109:53)
an idea it is to buy the game and then I (109:50 - 109:55)
got about a week into launch and I (109:53 - 109:58)
bought it look if you talk about week if (109:55 - 110:01)
let me tell you how uncomfortable it is (109:58 - 110:04)
that it displays me playing that game to (110:01 - 110:07)
all of all of my switch friends that I'm (110:04 - 110:08)
also friends with on Twitter that (110:07 - 110:11)
probably saw that Mario Kart rant if (110:08 - 110:15)
Mario Kart 8 fixed the online mode and (110:11 - 110:17)
like made it easier to make groups and a (110:15 - 110:19)
drop-in with friends and like to set up (110:17 - 110:24)
parties that might be worth another (110:19 - 110:26)
purchase which is what I'm assuming is (110:24 - 110:29)
going to happen with their paid online (110:26 - 110:31)
service in the future I am I'm not (110:29 - 110:33)
assuming I am assuming that service will (110:31 - 110:35)
be a complete disaster yeah you're (110:33 - 110:36)
probably right (110:35 - 110:39)
my my justification for buying it was (110:36 - 110:42)
that Mario Kart 8 is such an incredible (110:39 - 110:46)
game it's really good this is the same (110:42 - 110:48)
game but with the community (110:46 - 110:51)
reinvigorated because the community on (110:48 - 110:53)
the Wii U is dead and it's not coming (110:51 - 110:56)
back but I've played all those races a (110:53 - 110:58)
hundred thousand times (110:56 - 111:00)
you're right doesn't make it less fun (110:58 - 111:03)
though I mean it's if they were Oh (111:00 - 111:05)
one of the big the biggest turn-off for (111:03 - 111:08)
me was like the not fixed on line play (111:05 - 111:12)
if they were at e3 to say hey we're (111:08 - 111:16)
releasing 16 more tracks for Mario Kart (111:12 - 111:20)
8 I would consider purchasing it for (111:16 - 111:25)
those tracks because I loved that engine (111:20 - 111:30)
so much yeah but to pay $60 for a game (111:25 - 111:35)
that I played probably easily my most (111:30 - 111:38)
played Wii U game was now maybe Monster (111:35 - 111:40)
Hunter was my most played Wii U game but (111:38 - 111:43)
don't get me wrong I love Mario Kart 8 I (111:40 - 111:46)
just don't see the I don't understand (111:43 - 111:48)
the disconnect between people wanting (111:46 - 111:51)
more things to play on switch and (111:48 - 111:54)
wanting more games and then completely (111:51 - 111:59)
not buying Puyo Puyo Tetris which is $30 (111:54 - 112:01)
you've never played it unless you've (111:59 - 112:03)
imported it from Japan and if you (112:01 - 112:05)
imported from Japan you clearly really (112:03 - 112:07)
liked Puyo Puyo Tetris that you'd (112:05 - 112:10)
probably buy it again booyah booyah (112:07 - 112:13)
Tetris has a complete story mode hey in (112:10 - 112:15)
my defense story campaign (112:13 - 112:19)
it has Tetris it has Puyo Puyo it has a (112:15 - 112:22)
combination of Tetris and Puyo Puyo it (112:19 - 112:25)
has online play what in my defense I (112:22 - 112:28)
also bought booyah Tetris because it's a (112:25 - 112:32)
good game it's an incredible hood that's (112:28 - 112:35)
very good I am so frustrated at the the (112:32 - 112:38)
switch community if you bought Mario (112:35 - 112:42)
Kart 8 deluxe spend the $30 get booyah (112:38 - 112:45)
Tetris 2 it's worth it you already spent (112:42 - 112:47)
60 bucks on a game that already exists (112:45 - 112:50)
it's gonna be fun (112:47 - 112:52)
I'm just switching my showerhead and I'm (112:50 - 112:54)
loaded I'm sure all those fish I'm (112:52 - 112:56)
really sorry I'm sure all those people (112:54 - 112:59)
who bought Mario Cart to begin with but (112:56 - 113:03)
the $20 worth of extra tracks that's $80 (112:59 - 113:05)
I paid $80 for that game heck if I'm (113:03 - 113:07)
gonna play pay another $60 for that game (113:05 - 113:09)
and don't dare don't tell me of battle (113:07 - 113:11)
modes worth it no battle mode is not (113:09 - 113:14)
worth $60 no I don't think so either I (113:11 - 113:17)
also know that the online is fixed so I (113:14 - 113:20)
could enjoy battle mode without 2006 (113:17 - 113:23)
internet that Mario Kart 8 deluxe is (113:20 - 113:27)
based off of um maybe but the toilet (113:23 - 113:31)
hurry up easily so angry uh and I'm (113:27 - 113:33)
gonna bet that they're not gonna release (113:31 - 113:35)
any DLC for it because if they were (113:33 - 113:37)
gonna do that they would probably just (113:35 - 113:39)
release a new Mario Kart because they (113:37 - 113:40)
know people are gonna pay for it they (113:39 - 113:44)
paid $60 for a game I paid $60 for game (113:40 - 113:47)
that already exists what I mean they (113:44 - 113:49)
they ported the engine like it's it's (113:47 - 113:51)
completely up and running on switch I (113:49 - 113:53)
can't imagine after that it's it's hard (113:51 - 113:54)
to make more tracks (113:53 - 113:56)
yeah but they would just put it in a New (113:54 - 113:58)
Guinea Mario Kart 9 why wouldn't they (113:56 - 113:59)
you know because just if it's Mario (113:58 - 114:02)
Canin it would be a completely new (113:59 - 114:05)
engine no why would they do that because (114:02 - 114:07)
every single Mario Kart has a completely (114:05 - 114:08)
new engine (114:07 - 114:10)
the Rainbows want to selection for a (114:08 - 114:11)
million years (114:10 - 114:12)
to where they add one new gun and they (114:11 - 114:16)
go it's a sequel Mario Kart has always (114:12 - 114:19)
had a new engine everybody's doing that (114:16 - 114:21)
was splatoon why would they do with (114:19 - 114:22)
Mario come he does they haven't done it (114:21 - 114:25)
for the last eight games sevens was (114:22 - 114:28)
genetically different than eight yes DSP (114:25 - 114:32)
knows a 3ds game d/s was completely (114:28 - 114:34)
different than what any right they're (114:32 - 114:36)
all different and I like that about (114:34 - 114:39)
Mario Kart except seven I didn't like (114:36 - 114:42)
seven that much but I'm saying dr is (114:39 - 114:45)
good Mario Kart 8 always feels like a (114:42 - 114:49)
sequel because it's it's different (114:45 - 114:52)
enough whether that's the drifting or (114:49 - 114:56)
the items or the tracks or it's (114:52 - 114:58)
different enough whereas like splatoon 2 (114:56 - 115:02)
is literally splatoon with dual pistols (114:58 - 115:04)
that's all you get all right (115:02 - 115:06)
got a sequel I think you and I might be (115:04 - 115:07)
the only two people in the world that (115:06 - 115:10)
are not excited for splatoon too so (115:07 - 115:12)
bitter how do you feel about the dog (115:10 - 115:15)
engine line oh that's okay nice wasn't (115:12 - 115:17)
it Knox late to join you together I (115:15 - 115:19)
wanted to like splatoon one I've (115:17 - 115:21)
invested a lot of time into wanting to (115:19 - 115:24)
like it and I just couldn't I my biggest (115:21 - 115:26)
gripe was that it took four hours to (115:24 - 115:27)
play a new map I've heard that they've (115:26 - 115:30)
reduced it to two why that exists at all (115:27 - 115:33)
still boggles my mind I mean that part (115:30 - 115:36)
didn't really bother me (115:33 - 115:39)
that really bothered me anyways we don't (115:36 - 115:41)
need to go on a platoon splatoon (115:39 - 115:43)
off-topic will complain about splatoon (115:41 - 115:46)
when it comes out all right let's do a (115:43 - 115:47)
couple more emails here this email is (115:46 - 115:52)
from Jordan location on holiday in (115:47 - 115:56)
Kefalonia from the UK I don't know I (115:52 - 115:57)
don't know if I said that right or where (115:56 - 116:00)
that is hi Steve hey whoever he has with (115:57 - 116:02)
him I've been listening to the podcast (116:00 - 116:04)
for two years thank you (116:02 - 116:06)
a massive fan of the show and became a (116:04 - 116:07)
patreon backer at the beginning of the (116:06 - 116:10)
year thank you again I wanted to keep my (116:07 - 116:12)
email short and sweet I think you guys (116:10 - 116:14)
do a fantastic job the podcast brighten (116:12 - 116:16)
up brightens up my somewhat dull Monday (116:14 - 116:17)
mornings let's get this out of the way (116:16 - 116:19)
you are all fantastic but will is my (116:17 - 116:22)
favorite he has helped me out with a few (116:19 - 116:24)
questions I post on slack plus his (116:22 - 116:26)
constant need to correct Steve is very (116:24 - 116:27)
amusing (116:26 - 116:30)
I don't know if that's true one so what (116:27 - 116:32)
my one question I have no shame in (116:30 - 116:34)
admitting Charizard is my favorite (116:32 - 116:36)
Pokemon I got into the games at (116:34 - 116:37)
generation one so I have a special place (116:36 - 116:39)
my heart for this dragon that isn't a (116:37 - 116:42)
dragon unless it's mega but as we are an (116:39 - 116:44)
generation 7 should I take a step back (116:42 - 116:47)
and leave my generation 1 feelings (116:44 - 116:49)
behind and pick a new Pokemon anyways (116:47 - 116:52)
keep doing what you're doing Jordan uh (116:49 - 116:54)
so let me get one thing out of the way (116:52 - 116:58)
here will is almost always wrong that is (116:54 - 116:59)
so not true (116:58 - 117:03)
well so not true this is what I love (116:59 - 117:05)
about will though I'm gonna call out (117:03 - 117:08)
Logan here I was very mad at Logan last (117:05 - 117:11)
week and the reason being is because we (117:08 - 117:13)
had that debate about the contest and (117:11 - 117:15)
and Mike is here now maybe Michael wanna (117:13 - 117:18)
chime in and locate everyone from (117:15 - 117:20)
logan for the most part agreed with me (117:18 - 117:24)
and had every opportunity to express (117:20 - 117:26)
those opinions and he didn't instead he (117:24 - 117:29)
was like I don't like debate guys let's (117:26 - 117:30)
move on (117:29 - 117:34)
no your Logan man I love hot ok she (117:30 - 117:36)
doesn't like it when mom and dad are (117:34 - 117:37)
fighting (117:36 - 117:40)
yeah and and will and I are mom and dad (117:37 - 117:42)
and we fight all the time and I think (117:40 - 117:44)
that is one of the reasons why I love (117:42 - 117:46)
will because I don't think I've ever (117:44 - 117:51)
actually been mad at will hmm I don't (117:46 - 117:53)
think you're right there either mine I (117:51 - 117:56)
don't think I've ever liked like I I (117:53 - 117:57)
would say the same thing about Micah (117:56 - 118:00)
like Mike and I get into the dumbest (117:57 - 118:03)
arguments but I don't man I don't think (118:00 - 118:06)
it'd only I'm ever actually mad it's (118:03 - 118:08)
just like this was dumb and then five (118:06 - 118:10)
minutes later I'm like hey you wanna (118:08 - 118:13)
watch wrestling and you sent me a very (118:10 - 118:16)
stern email in January of 2013 I said (118:13 - 118:17)
she that Stern email because you were (118:16 - 118:21)
not talking to me that was the reason oh (118:17 - 118:26)
please you believe that I remember I (118:21 - 118:27)
remember everything (118:26 - 118:32)
uh Mike aha take on contest should (118:27 - 118:34)
people do it or should they be paid I'm (118:32 - 118:37)
a what for what you can't just can't (118:34 - 118:38)
just throw me into this (118:37 - 118:41)
alright last week contests the last week (118:38 - 118:42)
somebody wrote in maybe it was two weeks (118:41 - 118:45)
ago I can't even remember mr. goes whole (118:42 - 118:49)
podcast is so hotly debated somebody (118:45 - 118:50)
wrote in and said Pokemon should do a (118:49 - 118:54)
contest where people draw a Pokemon a (118:50 - 118:55)
new Pokemon and then Pokemon picks a (118:54 - 118:59)
winner oh and will said they should and (118:55 - 119:04)
I said no and Logan also said no so (118:59 - 119:06)
thank you slack for not acknowledging (119:04 - 119:08)
that Logan also said no because he did (119:06 - 119:11)
and that's why I'm mad at Logan because (119:08 - 119:13)
he he could have he could have expressed (119:11 - 119:15)
himself more but he chose not to get (119:13 - 119:18)
into mom and dad's argument and my know (119:15 - 119:21)
was because Pokemon is a billion dollar (119:18 - 119:24)
company and I don't think it's fair and (119:21 - 119:28)
while it's by choice for a person to (119:24 - 119:30)
enter a contest no one's forcing them to (119:28 - 119:32)
I still don't think it's fair (119:30 - 119:36)
to take four have those to have those (119:32 - 119:39)
artists spend the time to make a Pokemon (119:36 - 119:43)
and then to only pick one and then they (119:39 - 119:45)
don't get anything for it and you can (119:43 - 119:47)
say and there is no cash value to this (119:45 - 119:49)
contest but let's just say they get like (119:47 - 119:52)
$10,000 that that still doesn't reward (119:49 - 119:56)
anyone else for their time and I don't (119:52 - 119:58)
think it's even if there if there was no (119:56 - 120:00)
money or if there was money it's still a (119:58 - 120:03)
fact of a billion dollar corporation (120:00 - 120:05)
taking something you made and will (120:03 - 120:09)
continue to make money on it for the (120:05 - 120:11)
rest of pokemons lifetime because as we (120:09 - 120:14)
know Pokemon will outlive earth but so (120:11 - 120:17)
any plushies any t-shirts any movies uh (120:14 - 120:20)
poke mining games anything in spin-offs (120:17 - 120:23)
like it's just weird to me it's weird to (120:20 - 120:26)
have something a person would create as (120:23 - 120:29)
seeing a company that's already worth (120:26 - 120:31)
billions of dollars continue to make (120:29 - 120:33)
Billy not Billy they probably won't make (120:31 - 120:34)
billions off one pokemon but maybe (120:33 - 120:38)
millions off plush sales and action (120:34 - 120:41)
figures in movies if you made you know (120:38 - 120:44)
kora kora Mon and you know it's on the (120:41 - 120:46)
cover of a movie you're not seeing any (120:44 - 120:48)
of that money after the contest you're (120:46 - 120:51)
not singing royalties from that I got a (120:48 - 120:52)
couple feelings about the summer make (120:51 - 120:55)
them as brief as possible the the artist (120:52 - 120:57)
in me immediately hates that the (120:55 - 120:59)
freelance artist in me immediately hates (120:57 - 121:02)
the idea because I hate when (120:59 - 121:04)
companies that aren't billion-dollar (121:02 - 121:07)
companies do that I hate that when a (121:04 - 121:10)
shop down the street (121:07 - 121:13)
says we're gonna have a contest and (121:10 - 121:15)
whoever makes the coolest logo that's (121:13 - 121:17)
gonna be our new logo that's a cop-out (121:15 - 121:19)
what you're trying to do is get art for (121:17 - 121:22)
free and get a logo for free without (121:19 - 121:24)
having to pay your artists don't do that (121:22 - 121:27)
that's a really bad way to do anything (121:24 - 121:32)
the illogical person in me loves that (121:27 - 121:34)
idea though because there's something (121:32 - 121:37)
that I have I have art friends who have (121:34 - 121:39)
participated in something called the (121:37 - 121:43)
monster project which is it's a (121:39 - 121:47)
basically an art gallery that we're or a (121:43 - 121:51)
collection of art where kids will draw (121:47 - 121:53)
monsters not pocket monsters not Pokemon (121:51 - 121:55)
they'll just draw like digital monsters (121:53 - 121:58)
a monster they make up in their head (121:55 - 122:00)
they'll you know how kids will destroy (121:58 - 122:02)
like the craziest weird monsters they (122:00 - 122:05)
can think of that have twenty seven (122:02 - 122:08)
horns and 18 eyes and a million arms and (122:05 - 122:10)
whatever and there are all kinds of (122:08 - 122:13)
colors and it's great they'll take those (122:10 - 122:14)
kids drawings and they'll distribute (122:13 - 122:17)
them amongst professional artists (122:14 - 122:18)
professional illustrators and then (122:17 - 122:21)
they'll make those into actual (122:18 - 122:24)
professional illustrations and then they (122:21 - 122:25)
bring them back to the kids and show (122:24 - 122:28)
them to them and the kids absolutely (122:25 - 122:31)
love it I think from the perspective of (122:28 - 122:35)
kids seeing their Pokemon that they made (122:31 - 122:37)
up in their head turned into a real (122:35 - 122:39)
thing and being able to play that in the (122:37 - 122:41)
game they would absolutely love it but (122:39 - 122:43)
that would only be like one kid but I (122:41 - 122:45)
also think that it sets a really bad (122:43 - 122:52)
precedent by saying uh hey do our art (122:45 - 122:54)
for us and don't we that way we don't (122:52 - 122:57)
have to pay for the art thanks guys (122:54 - 123:00)
you saved us some money there was a (122:57 - 123:03)
person on Twitter a law for a Milwaukee (123:00 - 123:06)
law firm will say and they posted hey (123:03 - 123:08)
we're looking for a new logo and the (123:06 - 123:10)
winner will get twenty five thousand (123:08 - 123:12)
dollars and the only thing I could think (123:10 - 123:15)
of was why don't (123:12 - 123:19)
you just hire an artist and pay them (123:15 - 123:23)
yeah I'll pay them an hourly wage for a (123:19 - 123:25)
logo like there are so many talented (123:23 - 123:27)
people out there why do you need a (123:25 - 123:30)
contest for I've done logo design (123:27 - 123:33)
I know mica does design I know what I (123:30 - 123:37)
charge for design I know roughly what (123:33 - 123:39)
mica charges for design I've hired (123:37 - 123:42)
people for like the illustrations that (123:39 - 123:45)
we did the the profile illustrations (123:42 - 123:48)
like I paid an artist for that and I (123:45 - 123:49)
paid them an hourly wage so I know what (123:48 - 123:52)
that costs even if you were to double (123:49 - 123:55)
triple that cost per hour (123:52 - 123:58)
heck quadruple that cost per hour (123:55 - 124:01)
quadruple that hourly rate it still does (123:58 - 124:06)
not come anywhere near $25,000 correct (124:01 - 124:10)
so why are you hosting a contest to give (124:06 - 124:13)
somebody $25,000 for a logo when in (124:10 - 124:15)
reality you could pay somebody four (124:13 - 124:17)
times the amount they charge and it (124:15 - 124:19)
doesn't even come close to that what (124:17 - 124:21)
you're doing is you're getting a whole (124:19 - 124:22)
bunch of logos put in front of you for (124:21 - 124:24)
free and then what you're going to do is (124:22 - 124:25)
you're going to have somebody that you (124:24 - 124:28)
know slightly copy somebody's logo and (124:25 - 124:29)
you're gonna pay them a hundred bucks (124:28 - 124:32)
and you're gonna say what the winner was (124:29 - 124:34)
so-and-so but you know there's no proof (124:32 - 124:35)
we can't prove that was the winner but (124:34 - 124:37)
they're gonna say there was a winner (124:35 - 124:39)
that's right I mean even if they don't (124:37 - 124:41)
like even if they'd if they're not that (124:39 - 124:45)
shady about it they're still going about (124:41 - 124:48)
it in the worst way possible when they (124:45 - 124:51)
could just hire a designer full-time or (124:48 - 124:57)
have a designer on on call for any (124:51 - 124:59)
design work that they might need and it (124:57 - 125:01)
would cost them a lot less than just (124:59 - 125:07)
throwing twenty-five G's at somebody - (125:01 - 125:09)
to make them a logo because they're too (125:07 - 125:13)
lazy to - but you know hire somebody (125:09 - 125:16)
it's it's a mess I've seen that handful (125:13 - 125:20)
of times nowhere like even small (125:16 - 125:22)
businesses will be like hey design us a (125:20 - 125:25)
logo and the winner gets that's our logo (125:22 - 125:28)
now if you're a business (125:25 - 125:32)
you should factor your branding into the (125:28 - 125:34)
cost of your business and if you don't (125:32 - 125:37)
you're a bad business (125:34 - 125:40)
will you had an e you were on the side (125:37 - 125:42)
of doing the contest you had me followed (125:40 - 125:45)
I mean it's it's it's a different it's a (125:42 - 125:46)
different perspective I mean I (125:45 - 125:49)
completely agree with with Micah and you (125:46 - 125:52)
know what it may be actually becoming a (125:49 - 125:55)
like a TOMS shoes kind of issue right (125:52 - 125:57)
because you've seen the the whole was (125:55 - 125:59)
Adam ruins everything (125:57 - 126:00)
yeah yeah I'm shoes you want to do the (125:59 - 126:02)
too long didn't read for Toms so (126:00 - 126:06)
basically the people in the countries (126:02 - 126:07)
that are receiving the shoes for (126:06 - 126:09)
donations don't really need shoes and (126:07 - 126:10)
you're just putting the cobblers in (126:09 - 126:16)
those countries out of work yes so you (126:10 - 126:18)
think you're doing a good thing and yeah (126:16 - 126:20)
shoes are getting donated but you're (126:18 - 126:23)
actually hurting people yes so so I (126:20 - 126:25)
don't know but I mean just overall the (126:23 - 126:29)
idea the idea of a contest is fun but (126:25 - 126:32)
the meta you know philosophical behind (126:29 - 126:34)
it of whether it's morally good or I (126:32 - 126:36)
mean I I don't believe in rally but (126:34 - 126:39)
general for other people who do if it's (126:36 - 126:43)
morally good in the whole length of the (126:39 - 126:46)
universe do you have such a contest well (126:43 - 126:49)
maybe not this still I think it's fun to (126:46 - 126:50)
draw pictures and have fun (126:49 - 126:53)
this would be my compromise my (126:50 - 126:58)
compromise would be that you enter so (126:53 - 127:00)
you have a contest this is like I said (126:58 - 127:02)
this my compromise you have a contest of (127:00 - 127:06)
we want a fan to make a Pokemon you (127:02 - 127:09)
submit your portfolio to the Pokemon (127:06 - 127:11)
company (127:09 - 127:13)
and whether or not you need to you know (127:11 - 127:15)
design some Pokemon or do some art to (127:13 - 127:17)
fill out your portfolio you know that's (127:15 - 127:20)
on you but you submit your portfolio and (127:17 - 127:22)
then they look at everyone's portfolio (127:20 - 127:25)
before people are doing hours and hours (127:22 - 127:27)
of work and you go (127:25 - 127:30)
I like that person's portfolio let's fly (127:27 - 127:32)
that person out and let's have them (127:30 - 127:34)
design a pokemon that way you're not (127:32 - 127:37)
making thousands of people make Pokemon (127:34 - 127:39)
and then all of a sudden you're looking (127:37 - 127:41)
at a thousand different hodgepodge (127:39 - 127:44)
Pokemon and trying to pick one instead (127:41 - 127:45)
it even better I instead you're looking (127:44 - 127:48)
at somebody's talent and their range and (127:45 - 127:51)
scope of ability of like oh like look at (127:48 - 127:53)
these six pieces you did like oh you (127:51 - 127:54)
made it you did a building you did a (127:53 - 127:57)
person you did a monster you did a fan (127:54 - 128:02)
art of Bill Nye the Science Guy um you (127:57 - 128:05)
have this range uh instead of just like (128:02 - 128:08)
one pokemon that might not have fully (128:05 - 128:10)
fleshed ideals and so when you pick that (128:08 - 128:12)
winner they can work with that winner to (128:10 - 128:15)
actually fully flesh out something (128:12 - 128:17)
that's just more than an image so so (128:15 - 128:19)
here's an even better idea I think the (128:17 - 128:22)
Pokemon company should identify all the (128:19 - 128:24)
different kinds of work that they need (128:22 - 128:28)
done and then put like on a website like (128:24 - 128:30)
little mini contests of all the (128:28 - 128:32)
different kinds of work than you've done (128:30 - 128:34)
and then people submit like a little (128:32 - 128:36)
one-page description of their life (128:34 - 128:38)
history of the kind of work that they (128:36 - 128:40)
can do and then the Pokemon company will (128:38 - 128:42)
look at those and say well this person (128:40 - 128:44)
has done this kind of work in the past (128:42 - 128:46)
so that means that they can do this kind (128:44 - 128:48)
of work and then they like fly them out (128:46 - 128:50)
there or they make them pay for (128:48 - 128:52)
themselves to fly out there and then (128:50 - 128:54)
they just pay them like every two weeks (128:52 - 128:56)
to come and do the kind of work that (128:54 - 128:58)
they need to get done because it's (128:56 - 129:00)
called a job call it you can call it (128:58 - 129:05)
Pocket monster.com now they use it a (129:00 - 129:07)
different hiring light but whatever (129:05 - 129:13)
I also I also like the the concept of (129:07 - 129:17)
hey this artist did these six Pokemon (129:13 - 129:19)
instead of like hey this artist just did (129:17 - 129:22)
one Pokemon I would love to see an (129:19 - 129:24)
entire generation (129:22 - 129:27)
an ass pin off game that is just (129:24 - 129:30)
children's submitted art for created (129:27 - 129:32)
monsters that they then took and turned (129:30 - 129:36)
into actual Pokemon now because I'm the (129:32 - 129:39)
spoke matter forever yeah that's fine (129:36 - 129:41)
this is what I would want now this would (129:39 - 129:43)
be better this is that you saw 100 (129:41 - 129:45)
Pokemon drawings from children you have (129:43 - 129:49)
professional one no new poke now not a (129:45 - 129:52)
new Pokemon now that kids made up that (129:49 - 129:54)
they drew they drew with crayons on (129:52 - 129:57)
paper and they look terrible and they (129:54 - 129:59)
look ridiculous and they look hilarious (129:57 - 130:01)
and they send them to the Pokemon (129:59 - 130:03)
company and the Pokemon company has (130:01 - 130:05)
their professional artists illustrate (130:03 - 130:07)
monsters that look exactly like those (130:05 - 130:11)
but good professional art and then you (130:07 - 130:12)
put them in their own game called (130:11 - 130:15)
Pokemon kids version and its own (130:12 - 130:18)
generation now spit Anka Myka Myka they (130:15 - 130:22)
already did that it's called yokai watch (130:18 - 130:25)
Jesus as a big fan of yokai watch I'm (130:22 - 130:29)
very offended right now the burn meter (130:25 - 130:30)
is just out of control (130:29 - 130:33)
I would rather just have kids draw a (130:30 - 130:36)
really terrible current pokemon and just (130:33 - 130:39)
see like a really deform Pikachu in a (130:36 - 130:42)
game of like - like how they did how (130:39 - 130:47)
they did Kirby's the cran Kirby whatever (130:42 - 130:49)
or maybe it was a Yoshi yarn Kirby (130:47 - 130:53)
excuse me grand Kirby grand Kirby wasn't (130:49 - 130:54)
there a Kirby or a Yoshi game that was (130:53 - 130:57)
like in cran and sub y r n-- I'm pretty (130:54 - 130:59)
sure there was but I would like to see (130:57 - 130:59)
that (130:59 - 131:01)
but with badly drawn real Pokemon not no (130:59 - 131:04)
made-up Pokemon we should read this (131:01 - 131:07)
email before we got into this debate but (131:04 - 131:09)
Jackson wrote in and said Aloha SBJ and (131:07 - 131:11)
crew it's Jackson Jackson back with (131:09 - 131:13)
another email I was pushed to write this (131:11 - 131:14)
after the last episode where you guys (131:13 - 131:16)
got a heated debate about Pokemon design (131:14 - 131:19)
competition idea I myself strongly agree (131:16 - 131:20)
with will and think that these artists (131:19 - 131:23)
love taking time to make these Pokemon (131:20 - 131:24)
designs and would love it even more if (131:23 - 131:26)
they could actually get some benefit (131:24 - 131:27)
from them I know what the benefit would (131:26 - 131:30)
be besides it being just existing no no (131:27 - 131:34)
no have some self-respect as an artist (131:30 - 131:37)
a mad anyways I don't want I don't want (131:34 - 131:39)
to get into this too much I want to know (131:37 - 131:43)

Jackson I don't think we had need to (131:48 - 131:52)
debate about the contest anymore like I (131:51 - 131:54)
said that probably should read that (131:52 - 131:55)
prior mm-hm (131:54 - 131:58)
all I'm asking is if you're an artist (131:55 - 131:59)
have some self respect for yourself (131:58 - 132:01)
that's it if you value yourself self (131:59 - 132:04)
respect Micah you'd get a reasonable job (132:01 - 132:07)
like a good banker hey mom I concur get (132:04 - 132:10)

somewhere (135:38 - 135:41)
I messed up Pokemon of the week this (135:40 - 135:44)
week I originally was like hey we should (135:41 - 135:47)
do porygon too and then slack was like (135:44 - 135:54)
you guys already did porygon - we're (135:47 - 135:56)
gonna go with gala spot even though I am (135:54 - 136:00)
NOT a fan of doing generation 7 Pokemon (135:56 - 136:04)
mostly because there's not there's not (136:00 - 136:06)
like trivia about it and that's kind of (136:04 - 136:07)
my favorite part of Pokemon of the week (136:06 - 136:12)
in my opinion is the trivia but since we (136:07 - 136:15)
messed up and didn't have didn't have (136:12 - 136:19)
enough time to get a flush at moveset (136:15 - 136:21)
because people made for porygon - and we (136:19 - 136:23)
already did that go with gala spot here (136:21 - 136:26)
with an assault vest adamant nature 252 (136:23 - 136:31)
HP 252 attack for defense emergency exit (136:26 - 136:34)
ability with the moves first impression (136:31 - 136:37)
leech life liquidation and then your (136:34 - 136:40)
last option being Sucker Punch poison (136:37 - 136:44)
jab or aqua jet Kevin rights gala spot (136:40 - 136:46)
is a slow heavy hitter but has an (136:44 - 136:48)
amazing type and great moves first (136:46 - 136:50)
impression does a 90 power base damage (136:48 - 136:53)
and it goes first but it can only be (136:50 - 136:55)
used once until gala spot switches which (136:53 - 136:58)
can work with its ability liquidation is (136:55 - 137:00)
a straw as a solid stab type water move (136:58 - 137:03)
bleach life is also stab and heals him (137:00 - 137:06)
last move is for flexibility and (137:03 - 137:09)
coverage depending on your team he works (137:06 - 137:13)
well with people with Pokemon such as (137:09 - 137:15)
orange aru because they are slow (137:13 - 137:17)
alternatively somebody who hits hard and (137:15 - 137:20)
fast like Salim ants can lead and lead (137:17 - 137:23)
the charge with callous pod and clean up (137:20 - 137:28)
so Salamence orang guru two good choices (137:23 - 137:31)
to use with godless pod there you go (137:28 - 137:35)
sorry I'm not Travis and giving you a (137:31 - 137:36)
little more in depth but I think that's (137:35 - 137:38)
alright feel like I feel like that (137:36 - 137:41)
covers covers the bases there you did (137:38 - 137:41)
great (137:41 - 137:44)
thanks gals spot if you didn't know is a (137:41 - 137:47)
bug slash water type Pokemon only (137:44 - 137:49)
ability as emergency exit at least (137:47 - 137:50)
listed here (137:49 - 137:52)
I believe you're correct as far as I'm (137:50 - 137:54)
aware gala spot is like this like light (137:52 - 137:57)
green and a shiny one it's more white (137:54 - 138:00)
with blue highlights instead of green (137:57 - 138:03)
highlights and a little no trivia but (138:00 - 138:05)
gala spot may be based on a giant isopod (138:03 - 138:09)
and its armor of a samurai gala spot may (138:05 - 138:12)
be a combination of Goliath Goliath and (138:09 - 138:16)
isopod and that's all I got let's (138:12 - 138:17)
illustrate its pokedex entry that might (138:16 - 138:21)
give us something from Sun while (138:17 - 138:24)
flashing slash with a flashing slash of (138:21 - 138:27)
its giant sharp claws it Cleaves sweet (138:24 - 138:31)
water or even air right in - then for (138:27 - 138:33)
moon it battles skillfully with its six (138:31 - 138:35)
arms but spends most of its time (138:33 - 138:38)
peacefully meditating in caves deep (138:35 - 138:42)
beneath the sea interesting yeah I (138:38 - 138:45)
thought I think those kind of flesh out (138:42 - 138:46)
got a spot a little bit better I (138:45 - 138:51)
wouldn't have taken galas a pod for a (138:46 - 138:55)
meditator you know (138:51 - 138:59)
headspace yeah headspace er calm I would (138:55 - 139:04)
assume that's our way to get a headspace (138:59 - 139:08)
advertisement for $9.99 a month you can (139:04 - 139:15)
also be like gasp ah I think that's all (139:08 - 139:18)
we got for you guys it's uh jump over to (139:15 - 139:22)
some house cleaning clean the house here (139:18 - 139:25)
start with patreon so I updated the (139:22 - 139:28)
patreon rewards last night we do have a (139:25 - 139:31)
patreon patreon comm slash it's super (139:28 - 139:35)
effective there was a 20 and 25 dollar (139:31 - 139:38)
reward that are that are now gone and (139:35 - 139:40)
said there's now a 16 dollar reward in a (139:38 - 139:44)
new 25 dollar reward and they involved (139:40 - 139:46)
at dry shipping addresses so if you are (139:44 - 139:49)
an old you currently were backing at 20 (139:46 - 139:52)
or $25 I would suggest switching to the (139:49 - 139:54)
new 25 or like you're backing at 20 (139:52 - 139:57)
probably go down to 16 and like you're (139:54 - 139:58)
already being generous enough I don't (139:57 - 139:59)
know Matt I didn't change him to like (139:58 - 140:03)
try to pry more money out of people but (139:59 - 140:07)
the $60 a month I mm-hmm (140:03 - 140:10)
so we're gonna do a contest and so that (140:07 - 140:14)
the $60 a month uh will include uh some (140:10 - 140:17)
snail mail since that's been a recent (140:14 - 140:20)
talk so uh you'll get like what you get (140:17 - 140:24)
a monthly letter from me handwritten and (140:20 - 140:26)
my goal is most months those will (140:24 - 140:27)
include stickers and buttons inside (140:26 - 140:30)
because I have a lot of variations of (140:27 - 140:32)
stickers and buttons and I usually try (140:30 - 140:34)
to order some before a con or when I'm (140:32 - 140:38)
going to a Pokemon event so I always (140:34 - 140:39)
have different kind of stickers laying (140:38 - 140:41)
around that I wanted to start giving to (140:39 - 140:44)
patreon backers so besides a handwritten (140:41 - 140:45)
letter you'll get some stickers and (140:44 - 140:49)
buttons each month and then for $25 I (140:45 - 140:51)
wanted to do like a Google's Google (140:49 - 140:53)
hangout slash you know group video chat (140:51 - 140:56)
whatever seems to work with a set amount (140:53 - 140:59)
of people with obviously backers at that (140:56 - 141:02)
level so and I'll probably do two or (140:59 - 141:03)
three of those at the end of the month (141:02 - 141:05)
because I would assume that not everyone (141:03 - 141:06)
can make the same time so just to make (141:05 - 141:08)
sure that people at those backing at (141:06 - 141:10)
those levels you know get the actually (141:08 - 141:12)
get the rewards that's the goal also the (141:10 - 141:14)
25 gets everything below it so you'd (141:12 - 141:16)
also get the stickers and buttons every (141:14 - 141:19)
single month too so just some new (141:16 - 141:21)
patreon rewards and just a just a big (141:19 - 141:23)
shout-out to everyone that does support (141:21 - 141:25)
us on patreon you don't have to like it (141:23 - 141:27)

awesome enough just means a lot for (141:27 - 141:31)
people who listen and the people who (141:29 - 141:33)
write in and and if you do have like a (141:31 - 141:34)
dollar (141:33 - 141:37)
a month to throw our way it's just (141:34 - 141:40)
really really appreciated and not (141:37 - 141:42)
necessary so that's what I got there we (141:40 - 141:45)
have a sub reddit reddit comm slash are (141:42 - 141:48)

around mike has been around one or two (142:44 - 142:47)
times when I've told it and he's laughed (142:46 - 142:50)
every time so hopefully he laughs yeah (142:47 - 142:52)
every single time I don't know one of my (142:50 - 142:53)
favorite stories well I know (142:52 - 142:55)
I hope wheels heard it but I told I (142:53 - 142:57)
slightly told it in slack that's why (142:55 - 143:00)
there's now a Dreamsicle emoji and slack (142:57 - 143:04)
so Irene she has an addictive (143:00 - 143:06)
personality when it comes to you it also (143:04 - 143:09)
will has this - will used to eat an ice (143:06 - 143:11)
cream sandwich before bed every single (143:09 - 143:15)
light why do you remember everything (143:11 - 143:15)
wait a second why though is there like (143:16 - 143:21)
some is there some light back button (143:19 - 143:29)
that's ago guys litter not before bed by (143:21 - 143:30)
used to have an Ice Cream Sandwich (143:29 - 143:32)
everyday yes is it just to like treat (143:30 - 143:34)
yourself or was it like there was a (143:32 - 143:36)
light tag that you my one little treat (143:34 - 143:38)
for myself every day bit that's (143:36 - 143:41)
beautiful this because beautiful yeah so (143:38 - 143:45)
I feel like because of that instance (143:41 - 143:47)
Irene started having like an ice cream (143:45 - 143:48)
sandwich ever (143:47 - 143:50)
day before bed and then it moved and (143:48 - 143:53)
then it like switched to like those (143:50 - 143:54)
frizzy pops she would always have a (143:53 - 143:57)
frizzy pop before bed and then it's it (143:54 - 144:00)
switched over to a Dreamsicle and if you (143:57 - 144:02)
don't know what a Dreamsicle is it's (144:00 - 144:04)
like a popsicle except popsicles are ice (144:02 - 144:07)
and a dreamsicles ice cream and it's (144:04 - 144:11)
it's orange and vanilla ice cream but (144:07 - 144:14)
that yeah that's how you use like an (144:11 - 144:18)
orange dream an orange drink the drink (144:14 - 144:22)
it's that in ice cream form so Irene (144:18 - 144:24)
would have a dream school (144:22 - 144:25)
every night before bed she doesn't do (144:24 - 144:27)
that anymore I think she's onto a new a (144:25 - 144:31)
new favorite food before bed and so (144:27 - 144:34)
Irene also has insomnia so she has (144:31 - 144:36)
trouble sleeping so she takes sleep (144:34 - 144:40)
medication and her sleep medication (144:36 - 144:44)
takes anywhere between five minutes to (144:40 - 144:48)
like an hour to work but for the most (144:44 - 144:50)
part at work it it does this job does (144:48 - 144:51)
what it needs to do (144:50 - 144:54)
so III don't normally don't go to bed (144:51 - 144:56)
with Irene I usually am up to like 2:00 (144:54 - 144:57)
3:00 in the morning every single night (144:56 - 145:00)
she has to get up wait earlier for work (144:57 - 145:00)
that I do (145:00 - 145:02)
so she usually tries to go to bed around (145:00 - 145:05)
midnight I also do a lot of house closed (145:02 - 145:07)
house cleaning at night ah (145:05 - 145:09)
I also clean my house at night usually (145:07 - 145:12)
before I go to bed so it's like 12:30 in (145:09 - 145:15)
the morning I just finished probably (145:12 - 145:17)
playing some kind of game probably (145:15 - 145:19)
destiny or Final Fantasy 14 or something (145:17 - 145:22)
so I was like I'm gonna go upstairs get (145:19 - 145:23)
some laundry I'm gonna do like a load of (145:22 - 145:26)
laundry before bed and I walk upstairs (145:23 - 145:31)
and again Irene take sleep medication so (145:26 - 145:33)
all the lights are on in the bedroom and (145:31 - 145:38)
she is laying in bed with a Dreamsicle (145:33 - 145:41)
with only one bite taken out of it on (145:38 - 145:49)
her chest and she is fast asleep and I'm (145:41 - 145:52)
surely melting on her chest yeah oh (145:49 - 145:54)
absolutely I don't know how long she's (145:52 - 145:58)
been sleeping but she only got one bite (145:54 - 146:00)
of this Dreamsicle so it could've been (145:58 - 146:05)
very long so I wake her up so I shake (146:00 - 146:08)
her and she's like what what what and I (146:05 - 146:10)

it's been a couple minutes I come back (146:50 - 146:57)
up and she again has fallen asleep with (146:52 - 147:03)
