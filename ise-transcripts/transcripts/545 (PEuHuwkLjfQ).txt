after today I am will be in my first (0:58 - 1:03)
break in over a year and a half of work (1:01 - 1:06)
so I am excited I am going to play more (1:03 - 1:08)
Pokemon than I have been playing and I'm (1:06 - 1:11)
excited to sleep (1:08 - 1:13)
dang (1:11 - 1:16)
we did we did we did I'm sorry I'm (1:13 - 1:18)
crying out loud what is with you today (1:16 - 1:21)
and it was a Friday so you're like (1:18 - 1:23)
Friday break I I did the regrettable (1:21 - 1:27)
thing of going out today why because I (1:23 - 1:29)
was like oh I should go to my PO box and (1:27 - 1:30)
see if there's any like Christmas cards (1:29 - 1:33)
and stuff look our mail person sent us a (1:30 - 1:35)
letter today sent us an email saying (1:33 - 1:37)
guess what we're not delivering mail (1:35 - 1:40)
these two days because it is so cold and (1:37 - 1:42)
deadly out there y'all can wait and we (1:40 - 1:45)
were all like fine that's fine because I (1:42 - 1:46)
honestly do not want to open my front (1:45 - 1:49)
door to get whatever is out there (1:46 - 1:51)
because okay so this is the thing in (1:49 - 1:54)
Minnesota that sometimes you have like (1:51 - 1:56)
weird (1:54 - 1:57)
outside (1:56 - 2:00)
closets or like a little porch area (1:57 - 2:02)
where you just it becomes your second (2:00 - 2:04)
refrigerator because you just put stuff (2:02 - 2:06)
out there because it's cold sure so we (2:04 - 2:07)
have an airlock what we call the airlock (2:06 - 2:09)
which is there's a door and then there's (2:07 - 2:11)
a little waiting area and then there's (2:09 - 2:14)
the door to the outside we had to prop (2:11 - 2:17)
the door to the inside open (2:14 - 2:19)
because the pop we had in there was (2:17 - 2:22)
freezing because it's so cold that we (2:19 - 2:25)
had we had to heat it from the heat of (2:22 - 2:27)
the house so that all of our pop didn't (2:25 - 2:29)
explode (2:27 - 2:32)
I understand this is It's madness out (2:29 - 2:34)
there Brunswick can we run errands after (2:32 - 2:36)
you record I'm like I guess we have to (2:34 - 2:37)
start the car because otherwise the car (2:36 - 2:40)
will freeze and not start (2:37 - 2:42)
I'm waiting for all the tick tocks of (2:40 - 2:43)
people leaving their like monster (2:42 - 2:47)
energies in their car and then the next (2:43 - 2:48)
day being like it's all over the ceiling (2:47 - 2:52)
now I haven't seen any tick tocks of (2:48 - 2:54)
people taking boiling water walking (2:52 - 2:56)
outside and throwing it in the air which (2:54 - 2:57)
is a Minnesota thing because it (2:56 - 2:59)
instantly turns into snow (2:57 - 3:01)
I have not seen it I haven't seen people (2:59 - 3:04)
pour boiling water on their car (3:01 - 3:06)
windshield and then like cracking oh (3:04 - 3:08)
then it shatters yeah because yeah (3:06 - 3:09)
they're why would you do that no you (3:08 - 3:11)
take a cup of boiling water and you (3:09 - 3:13)
throw it in the air and it becomes snow (3:11 - 3:17)
because it is negative 35. (3:13 - 3:20)
uh well speaking speaking of boiling (3:17 - 3:20)
water (3:20 - 3:23)
we have some boiling news for you this (3:20 - 3:26)
week the transitions are always bad and (3:23 - 3:27)
this is one of the worst they're getting (3:26 - 3:30)
so good uh let's start off with the uh (3:27 - 3:32)
the raid stuff in Pokemon scarlet and (3:30 - 3:36)
Pokemon are we excited for cinderacy uh (3:32 - 3:37)
well we can talk about how Deli bird (3:36 - 3:39)
came and went (3:37 - 3:41)
uh that was that was the thing that (3:39 - 3:41)
happened (3:41 - 3:43)
um well technically it started last (3:41 - 3:45)
night as we were recording this because (3:43 - 3:47)
we're recording this before Christmas (3:45 - 3:50)
um they're doing uh Chris I mean Deli (3:47 - 3:52)
bird for Christmas is kind of like (3:50 - 3:56)
given typical yeah (3:52 - 3:56)
you think the stantlers in the game why (3:56 - 3:59)
why did they ever (3:58 - 4:02)
feel like for Christmas they could uh (3:59 - 4:03)
statler's in the background of Pokemon (4:02 - 4:07)
United for Christmas oh yeah see yeah (4:03 - 4:11)
if it was Stantler though (4:07 - 4:12)
because Delhi bird gives things away (4:11 - 4:14)
we're getting all the terror shirts from (4:12 - 4:17)
from the deli bird some would argue that (4:14 - 4:19)
it's always been the year of cragonal (4:17 - 4:21)
cragonal's in the game he's a snowflake (4:19 - 4:24)
feature him for Christmas nobody argues (4:21 - 4:26)
that you don't even argue that you (4:24 - 4:27)
decide these things there and then you (4:26 - 4:29)
properly forget it and never bring it up (4:27 - 4:31)
again until it's somehow convenient for (4:29 - 4:33)
you to bring it back up to a company (4:31 - 4:35)
that's like who are you (4:33 - 4:37)
uh I I think the the smart thing here (4:35 - 4:39)
was they did make it one to five star (4:37 - 4:42)
raids uh so that that is nice for people (4:39 - 4:45)
who are getting the game for the (4:42 - 4:47)
holidays uh because you could ideally (4:45 - 4:50)
boot up the game for the first time and (4:47 - 4:52)
find like a one star Deli bird and be (4:50 - 4:54)
able to do it (4:52 - 4:56)
um here kids you have one day of the (4:54 - 4:57)
Christmas (4:56 - 4:59)
several hours left before you can (4:57 - 5:02)
quickly get this never again uh Deli (4:59 - 5:04)
bird was through one to five star raids (5:02 - 5:07)
the bonus was uh more terror types of (5:04 - 5:09)
whatever type Deli bird was so if you (5:07 - 5:11)
were really looking for I don't know (5:09 - 5:13)
like electric tarot shards knocking out (5:11 - 5:15)
electric Deli bird (5:13 - 5:17)
if you could find one would give you it (5:15 - 5:19)
doesn't it did legitimately give you a (5:17 - 5:23)
lot of shards (5:19 - 5:23)
I was saying as I was getting less of (5:23 - 5:27)
the type that it was and more of the (5:25 - 5:28)
randoms (5:27 - 5:32)
I was seeing a mix on multiple ones like (5:28 - 5:35)
I fought a you get ice and then the the (5:32 - 5:38)
the type you get two I I so I feel like (5:35 - 5:41)
I'm at least three I was getting three (5:38 - 5:42)
to four (5:41 - 5:45)
different types yeah and I would get (5:42 - 5:47)
like it would say like so if I thought (5:45 - 5:49)
one that was Dragon so I got two dragon (5:47 - 5:52)
and it was like five steel five ice five (5:49 - 5:53)
bug (5:52 - 5:55)
and then down to the list it was like (5:53 - 5:58)
one ice or one Dragon at the same time (5:55 - 6:01)
yeah I just had this bad girls or I was (5:58 - 6:04)
paying attention I did all of them (6:01 - 6:06)
I did a handful and it felt like just (6:04 - 6:09)
two different no I had like almost all (6:06 - 6:12)
of mine had three to four Terror type (6:09 - 6:15)
and usually the odd ones were fives (6:12 - 6:18)
and the one that I had gone for were the (6:15 - 6:20)
smaller one I don't know it's probably (6:18 - 6:22)
random (6:20 - 6:24)
I don't remember looking at all of them (6:22 - 6:25)
because I was doing so many last night (6:24 - 6:26)
that after a while I was like whatever (6:25 - 6:28)
yeah at a certain point you just skip (6:26 - 6:30)
the red rewards and move on I care (6:28 - 6:31)
anymore (6:30 - 6:33)
click click click (6:31 - 6:36)
uh there there was um (6:33 - 6:38)
there was also a mystery gift code for a (6:36 - 6:41)
bonus 50 ice shards although you could (6:38 - 6:42)
argue that (6:41 - 6:47)
ice isn't a particularly great Tara type (6:42 - 6:50)
it's still nice to have the items yeah (6:47 - 6:51)
it's still nice to have the flexibility (6:50 - 6:53)
to have it (6:51 - 6:54)
um and they've been doing so many (6:53 - 6:56)
distributions (6:54 - 6:59)
they have they have uh that leads us (6:56 - 7:00)
into (6:59 - 7:04)
cinderace which there there is no news (7:00 - 7:06)
article here for um at least the (7:04 - 7:09)
englishpokemon.com website (7:06 - 7:12)
which is a little confused I I don't (7:09 - 7:15)
understand I mean this is just this (7:12 - 7:17)
company in a nutshell I don't understand (7:15 - 7:20)
this can like we all know cinderace is (7:17 - 7:22)
coming because the Japanese stuff (7:20 - 7:24)
mentioned it and the English stuff (7:22 - 7:26)
hasn't mentioned it yet (7:24 - 7:28)
I don't know (7:26 - 7:29)
um (7:28 - 7:31)
they do have a they do have a Tarot raid (7:29 - 7:33)
guide which I guess we can touch on (7:31 - 7:35)
um the thing about cinderace is it is (7:33 - 7:39)
the next seven star raid boss (7:35 - 7:41)
um so I guess we maybe know the pattern (7:39 - 7:43)
now there seems to be one seven star (7:41 - 7:46)
raid boss a month it will show up two of (7:43 - 7:48)
the weekends of the month (7:46 - 7:49)
um (7:48 - 7:52)
the reasoning for cinderase according to (7:49 - 7:55)
the switch news which literally no one (7:52 - 7:56)
boots up their switch and looks at that (7:55 - 7:59)
news area I don't maybe one person is (7:56 - 8:01)
like I check it every day I look at it (7:59 - 8:03)
and go what are the headlines but that's (8:01 - 8:05)
about it um so the switch news it said (8:03 - 8:08)
that the reason (8:05 - 8:10)
the reason for (8:08 - 8:13)
cinderace is because 2023 is year of the (8:10 - 8:14)
rabbit (8:13 - 8:18)
so that makes that makes sense yeah (8:14 - 8:19)
um I mean it could they could have done (8:18 - 8:21)
low Pony (8:19 - 8:23)
I (8:21 - 8:24)
yeah I guess (8:23 - 8:28)
they could have done Diggersby (8:24 - 8:28)
you're right but uh what if they did a (8:28 - 8:33)
Pokemon that would sell copies of their (8:31 - 8:35)
game because I don't think Diggersby is (8:33 - 8:37)
doing that yeah but you know low putty (8:35 - 8:39)
is if what if it was Mega low punny (8:37 - 8:40)
they're just like this is the mega form (8:39 - 8:42)
and it's permanently stuck as Mega low (8:40 - 8:44)
putty that would sell (8:42 - 8:47)
like hot cakes yeah it would so so prior (8:44 - 8:49)
to cinderace I actually thought the (8:47 - 8:51)
second Pokemon would be Greninja (8:49 - 8:53)
um and the reason I thought it would be (8:51 - 8:55)
Greninja is because one Greninja is in (8:53 - 8:57)
the source code (8:55 - 8:58)
um and two (8:57 - 9:01)
uh Greninja is the second most popular (8:58 - 9:03)
starter (9:01 - 9:07)
besides Charizard so if you're trying to (9:03 - 9:10)
set sell as many games as fast as (9:07 - 9:12)
possible you would probably front load (9:10 - 9:14)
that with your two most popular starters (9:12 - 9:18)
I I do think Greninja would actually get (9:14 - 9:21)
people to that are on the fence to (9:18 - 9:24)
purchase the game I I think there is a (9:21 - 9:26)
lot of weight in a cinder race I think (9:24 - 9:28)
people do like Cinder race I think the (9:26 - 9:31)
not the negative but the like cinderace (9:28 - 9:33)
is fresh in everyone's mind right like (9:31 - 9:34)
we just came off a game where cinderace (9:33 - 9:36)
was there so that's why I kind of found (9:34 - 9:40)
Greninja uh to to comment on the source (9:36 - 9:42)
code stuff this is exactly kind of like (9:40 - 9:44)
how sword and shield were structured (9:42 - 9:47)
obviously Leon had Charizard but there (9:44 - 9:51)
was no Blastoise or Venusaur in the on (9:47 - 9:52)
the podcast version I'm air cording in (9:51 - 9:54)
the source code (9:52 - 9:56)
Venusaur and Blastoise came with the (9:54 - 9:59)
crown Tundra Isle of armor DLC (9:56 - 10:00)
um Blastoise and Venusaur are (9:59 - 10:02)
technically not in the source code again (10:00 - 10:04)
just like sword and shield so they're (10:02 - 10:05)
not there (10:04 - 10:08)
um I think they will be there like I (10:05 - 10:11)
think that if we do get DLC they will be (10:08 - 10:12)
there because like Blastoise and (10:11 - 10:14)
Venusaur are still popular not as (10:12 - 10:16)
popular as Charizard still popular but (10:14 - 10:19)
we do know that the Gen 6 starters uh (10:16 - 10:22)
are in the The Source Code we now we (10:19 - 10:25)
know that cinderace and rilla boom and (10:22 - 10:28)
so she's Italian Italian (10:25 - 10:31)
are also in the code (10:28 - 10:33)
um (10:31 - 10:33)
so whenever they come that will be great (10:33 - 10:40)
maybe we're two for two for starters so (10:37 - 10:43)
I'm going to either guess they're going (10:40 - 10:45)
to go down the well here is the Gen 8 (10:43 - 10:47)
route so here are more gen 8 starters or (10:45 - 10:50)
maybe they just finish off the fire (10:47 - 10:53)
Trifecta here and we'll get Delphox next (10:50 - 10:56)
yeah do all the fire stuff (10:53 - 10:59)
um again they can add Pokemon at any (10:56 - 11:02)
point so to rely on like the whole like (10:59 - 11:04)
source code thing isn't I think some (11:02 - 11:06)
people put too much weight into that (11:04 - 11:08)
there was no gallerian Slowpoke in in (11:06 - 11:10)
sword and shield and one day galerian (11:08 - 11:12)
Slowpoke just showed up at the train (11:10 - 11:15)
station they can they can add Pokemon at (11:12 - 11:17)
any point so like super not worried (11:15 - 11:19)
about Blastoise and Venus or not being (11:17 - 11:21)
you know shipping in the game (11:19 - 11:22)
um (11:21 - 11:24)
you know male metal or gigantic smell (11:22 - 11:26)
metal was in sword and shield since day (11:24 - 11:28)
one we had to wait (11:26 - 11:30)
x amount of time before we even had (11:28 - 11:33)
access to it uh (11:30 - 11:36)
so cinderus is here uh Cinder Ice's (11:33 - 11:39)
Terror type will be fighting uh this has (11:36 - 11:40)
to be like intentional right like they (11:39 - 11:42)
like purpose like this is the like (11:40 - 11:44)
firefighting joke right game freaks yeah (11:42 - 11:47)
yeah like that's it's a troll the game (11:44 - 11:48)
freak is trolling us with like the fire (11:47 - 11:50)
fighting well it's funny because they're (11:48 - 11:51)
trolling us with a firefight again (11:50 - 11:53)
they're also trolling us with the (11:51 - 11:56)
Chinese astrology fire thing yeah oh (11:53 - 11:58)
wait it's like it's like the biggest (11:56 - 12:02)
company troll like somebody finally got (11:58 - 12:04)
a sense of humor and was like yeah let's (12:02 - 12:07)
let's really do it to him did we ever (12:04 - 12:09)
talk about the Zodiac stuff on the show (12:07 - 12:12)
oh yeah a little bit Seth it's not worth (12:09 - 12:14)
exploring (12:12 - 12:17)
I mean like the the Zodiac stuff was (12:14 - 12:19)
already a huge stretch (12:17 - 12:21)
for like the okay so for those that (12:19 - 12:24)
don't know like the The quick summary is (12:21 - 12:26)
there was there's a part of the fan base (12:24 - 12:28)
that believed that all the fire starters (12:26 - 12:30)
were based off different (12:28 - 12:33)
animals of the Chinese zodiac so like (12:30 - 12:36)
Charmander would be the dragon and for (12:33 - 12:38)
some reason they were like well Fennekin (12:36 - 12:41)
is a dog even though it's clearly a fox (12:38 - 12:45)
but okay so fox foxes and canines are (12:41 - 12:51)
ancestrally related yes yes but also (12:45 - 12:51)
a dog (12:52 - 12:56)
I mean they made plenty of dogs they (12:54 - 12:58)
have done the dog they have if there's (12:56 - 13:00)
anything we've learned from generation (12:58 - 13:03)
nine they like dogs and birds and there (13:00 - 13:05)
are so many dogs (13:03 - 13:07)
oh dogs birds and fish that's like gen 9 (13:05 - 13:10)
in a nutshell and bugs (13:07 - 13:11)
um I think Cyndaquil was supposed to be (13:10 - 13:14)
like a rat yeah like I got I got the (13:11 - 13:15)
dumb chart right okay give me the chart (13:14 - 13:17)
give me the chart Greg cyndaquila's the (13:15 - 13:21)
rat tepic is the pig obviously uh no (13:17 - 13:24)
stretches there Fennekin is the dog (13:21 - 13:27)
uh Chikorita is the rooster (13:24 - 13:30)
Chimchar is the monkey no sheep no Horse (13:27 - 13:34)
no snake Charmander is the Dragon score (13:30 - 13:38)
bunny is the rabbit and Linton is the (13:34 - 13:40)
Tiger (13:38 - 13:44)
yeah so so a lot of those do line up (13:40 - 13:47)
uh I I still think Fennekin is a stretch (13:44 - 13:48)
I still think Cyndaquil is a stretch (13:47 - 13:52)
here's the question who's Fue Coco the (13:48 - 13:53)
horse (13:52 - 13:57)
no the Bold the ox yeah because a male (13:53 - 13:59)
alligator or crocodile I think one or (13:57 - 14:03)
the other is is called a bull I believe (13:59 - 14:06)
that that is that is the biggest stretch (14:03 - 14:08)
out of all of them (14:06 - 14:10)
the the people who followed the Chinese (14:08 - 14:12)
zodiac they they made things work and (14:10 - 14:15)
now it's out the window except for the (14:12 - 14:17)
people who are still grasping on to what (14:15 - 14:19)
was it an alligator is of male (14:17 - 14:23)
alligators a bowl yep yeah no according (14:19 - 14:25)
to this I like it up (14:23 - 14:28)
a male crocodile is called (14:25 - 14:31)
a bowl okay (14:28 - 14:34)
they call a bowl a lot of things a lot (14:31 - 14:38)
of things are bulls cows I do think game (14:34 - 14:40)
freak is trolling us with the whole fact (14:38 - 14:43)
that they they picked a fire starter for (14:40 - 14:44)
the Chinese well they didn't have to (14:43 - 14:45)
pick it right it was like it was like (14:44 - 14:48)
easy to line up right like and then on (14:45 - 14:50)
top of that they were like out of all (14:48 - 14:52)
the terror types we could make Cinder (14:50 - 14:55)
Ace let's make it fighting (14:52 - 14:58)
the the biggest troll they've ever done (14:55 - 15:01)
okay this one's funny I always say this (14:58 - 15:02)
one is this was funny because it's got (15:01 - 15:04)
everything the same except it has way (15:02 - 15:07)
Coco as the dragon and Charmander is the (15:04 - 15:10)
goat g-o-a-t greatest of all time (15:07 - 15:12)
that made me smile for a half a second (15:10 - 15:15)
good on you internet that was almost (15:12 - 15:17)
fine I I heard that some of the Chinese (15:15 - 15:18)
zodiac people were going to move that (15:17 - 15:21)
Foy Coco to the dragon and then move (15:18 - 15:24)
Charizard to the snake because reptiles (15:21 - 15:26)
are snakes and that's how they were (15:24 - 15:28)
gonna make it work (15:26 - 15:28)
like (15:29 - 15:32)
you can't you can't fetch is not gonna (15:35 - 15:41)
happen it's like stop trying that's just (15:38 - 15:42)
gonna happen stop trying to make it (15:41 - 15:44)
happen (15:42 - 15:46)
um (15:44 - 15:48)
so uh you know we all we all came out of (15:46 - 15:50)
the Charizard raids now we're going into (15:48 - 15:54)
cinderace raids and my worry prior to (15:50 - 15:56)
them announcing (15:54 - 15:59)
cinderace was that people were just (15:56 - 16:00)
going to use what they built for (15:59 - 16:02)
Charizard and just kind of try to make (16:00 - 16:03)
it work for pretty much everything going (16:02 - 16:05)
forward we've already seen this sin race (16:03 - 16:06)
or not we've already seen people just (16:05 - 16:08)
bring whatever they built for Charizard (16:06 - 16:10)
and it's going forward uh that's why (16:08 - 16:12)
I've made a couple YouTube videos I (16:10 - 16:13)
already made a YouTube video of like (16:12 - 16:15)
what you should what you could build for (16:13 - 16:17)
cinderace and I think some of them are (16:15 - 16:18)
really fun (16:17 - 16:20)
um and helpful for other raids and then (16:18 - 16:22)
you know I made a general here are like (16:20 - 16:24)
six Pokemon that you can build for (16:22 - 16:26)
General raids uh to encourage people to (16:24 - 16:30)
try something else because I had that (16:26 - 16:33)
problem personally as you know you want (16:30 - 16:35)
to do raids right you know somebody's (16:33 - 16:37)
like hey I got in a Mungus raid you're (16:35 - 16:40)
like ah Mungus has higher Urban mystica (16:37 - 16:41)
drops like yeah and then you get to the (16:40 - 16:43)
Among Us right and you're like oh I (16:41 - 16:45)
don't have anything and you don't want (16:43 - 16:46)
to keep that person waiting right (16:45 - 16:48)
because they're like they got the raid (16:46 - 16:50)
so you so you're like I think I can make (16:48 - 16:52)
this work and then you like you fumble (16:50 - 16:54)
through it and you like you like barely (16:52 - 16:55)
get it and then you're like I should (16:54 - 16:56)
really build something different and (16:55 - 16:58)
then all of a sudden you get distracted (16:56 - 17:00)
you're like oh squirrel and then all of (16:58 - 17:01)
a sudden somebody else is like oh I got (17:00 - 17:03)
a raid and you're like oh yeah I was (17:01 - 17:04)
supposed to build something I think I (17:03 - 17:06)
can make this work again and that's like (17:04 - 17:09)
the loop you get into right so (17:06 - 17:10)
or you're sitting there and you're like (17:09 - 17:12)
oh I don't know what to build I don't I (17:10 - 17:14)
have so much candy I have so much (17:12 - 17:17)
vitamins and I don't want to put it into (17:14 - 17:19)
something that ends up being bad which (17:17 - 17:21)
is why I made the graphics and the (17:19 - 17:23)
YouTube videos to hopefully encourage (17:21 - 17:25)
people to build different things (17:23 - 17:26)
um (17:25 - 17:28)
but I wish game freak would release (17:26 - 17:30)
numbers for Charizard because as much as (17:28 - 17:32)
I've heard people say like (17:30 - 17:35)
oh Charizard was so easy there was (17:32 - 17:36)
probably an equal amount of people that (17:35 - 17:37)
were like I couldn't do Charizard like I (17:36 - 17:40)
couldn't do it solo I I you know my RAID (17:37 - 17:43)
group like barely was able to do it (17:40 - 17:45)
um because I would wager to bet that (17:43 - 17:49)
Charizard had more wins than (17:45 - 17:52)
defeats like I think Charizard beat more (17:49 - 17:55)
like oh I'd say I think Charizard beat (17:52 - 17:58)
more people than people beat Charizard (17:55 - 17:58)
that's probably true because a bunch of (18:01 - 18:06)
people would try it (18:04 - 18:08)
and a lot of people who did it solo just (18:06 - 18:10)
fine like did their iron hands because (18:08 - 18:14)
the NPCs don't reduce the the clock so (18:10 - 18:16)
they just powered it like they just (18:14 - 18:19)
gripped down Knuckles and did the whole (18:16 - 18:21)
did the thing it took them forever but (18:19 - 18:23)
they didn't mean to zoomero because I I (18:21 - 18:25)
hope no one's bringing iron hands oh no (18:23 - 18:26)
I know people who brought iron hands to (18:25 - 18:27)
Charizard I absolutely didn't know (18:26 - 18:30)
people who did this I think I think the (18:27 - 18:32)
one reason I don't agree Steve actually (18:30 - 18:35)
is that uh you have to get to a certain (18:32 - 18:37)
point in the game to have gotten to the (18:35 - 18:39)
Charizard right so if you could just (18:37 - 18:40)
start the game up and have gotten to (18:39 - 18:42)
those Charizard raids right away I think (18:40 - 18:44)
that it would be right that Charizard (18:42 - 18:46)
would have won against the players more (18:44 - 18:49)
you could if you were joining yes (18:46 - 18:51)
but I don't think everybody's gonna do (18:49 - 18:52)
that (18:51 - 18:55)
I disagree I have read so many comments (18:52 - 18:57)
on Instagram and tick tock not my own (18:55 - 18:58)
tick tocks (18:57 - 19:01)
uh but but my own tick tocks my own tick (18:58 - 19:02)
tocks other people's tick tocks of (19:01 - 19:04)
people being like well I brought a level (19:02 - 19:06)
60 Pokemon was that not good enough or (19:04 - 19:11)
like I I I brought my krakival was like (19:06 - 19:13)
and I couldn't beat it like the amount (19:11 - 19:15)
of comments I've read (19:13 - 19:17)
that were like I couldn't do Charizard (19:15 - 19:19)
and like I'm bummed because I won't be (19:17 - 19:21)
able to do cinder Ace was was incredibly (19:19 - 19:24)
high and I (19:21 - 19:28)
I helped over 50 unique people that said (19:24 - 19:30)
they could not do Charizard (19:28 - 19:33)
without coming to stream and joining and (19:30 - 19:34)
the reason like the 50 is high because (19:33 - 19:35)
it's like okay what three people haven't (19:34 - 19:37)
done Charizard right that's three next (19:35 - 19:40)
three next three like (19:37 - 19:43)
I I think we are underestimating how (19:40 - 19:47)
difficult it is verse (19:43 - 19:47)
um people's just general skill sets a a (19:47 - 19:53)
good analogy I could have is my (19:51 - 19:54)
analogies will always go back to Destiny (19:53 - 19:56)
when it comes to rating is I have gone (19:54 - 19:58)
through Vault of Glass 200 300 times it (19:56 - 20:01)
is incredibly easy for me super easy (19:58 - 20:03)
like I I could do that whole raid with (20:01 - 20:05)
my eyes closed (20:03 - 20:07)
um the reason that that raid fails is (20:05 - 20:08)
because one person doesn't do what they (20:07 - 20:11)
need to do and your whole team wipes (20:08 - 20:13)
same thing for Charizard it's very hard (20:11 - 20:16)
to do Charizard with three other people (20:13 - 20:19)
when one person dies three times one (20:16 - 20:20)
person dies three times is like nine (20:19 - 20:23)
minutes off your ten minute timer (20:20 - 20:25)
um and you lose even if the other three (20:23 - 20:28)
people are doing everything right so (20:25 - 20:32)
I do find like how many random raids (20:28 - 20:36)
existed where one person joined with a (20:32 - 20:38)
level 50 Pokemon or a 60 Pokemon and you (20:36 - 20:40)
can't see you have no clue what level (20:38 - 20:41)
their Pokemon is but they there's (20:40 - 20:43)
nothing the game doesn't actually kind (20:41 - 20:45)
of weird if you think about it the game (20:43 - 20:47)
should kind of have like a like a bare (20:45 - 20:49)
minimum like you should probably be like (20:47 - 20:51)
level I don't know 80 or 90 even though (20:49 - 20:53)
I don't recommend 80 or 90 you should (20:51 - 20:54)
just be 100. (20:53 - 20:57)
um where somebody's joining and that (20:54 - 20:59)
person causes that whole Ray to fail and (20:57 - 21:02)
if you're only playing with randoms (20:59 - 21:04)
you can like see oh like that person's (21:02 - 21:07)
dying a lot but like it's sometimes you (21:04 - 21:09)
can see it yeah sometimes sometimes you (21:07 - 21:11)
can sometimes you can't (21:09 - 21:13)
um I I mean I think we we are we are (21:11 - 21:15)
speculating off of our own confirmation (21:13 - 21:18)
by us right like you helped a lot of (21:15 - 21:19)
people because people were coming for (21:18 - 21:22)
you to help that and we don't have the (21:19 - 21:24)
breadth and width of the amount of (21:22 - 21:28)
people that even bothered so it it it's (21:24 - 21:30)
hard to say one way or the other it (21:28 - 21:32)
would be nice (21:30 - 21:35)
if the Pokemon company released that (21:32 - 21:38)
type of information just to say hey (21:35 - 21:40)
that was really tough a lot of you (21:38 - 21:43)
didn't make it here's a little help for (21:40 - 21:47)
the next one but it is way too hard to (21:43 - 21:48)
fall into the (21:47 - 21:51)
pattern of because I helped all these (21:48 - 21:54)
people that was my experience but I (21:51 - 21:55)
never really heard from the people that (21:54 - 21:57)
didn't need help and I have no idea (21:55 - 21:59)
that's why I literally brought up I have (21:57 - 22:02)
read tons of other people's tick tocks (21:59 - 22:03)
of and I just go through the comments of (22:02 - 22:05)
people being like I can't I couldn't do (22:03 - 22:08)
it I have but I have also heard from a (22:05 - 22:10)
lot of people who could right like we (22:08 - 22:13)
don't have solid numbers so yeah I I am (22:10 - 22:15)
just saying that like my the only point (22:13 - 22:18)
I'm trying to make is I don't think (22:15 - 22:19)
Charizard was as easy as people are (22:18 - 22:21)
giving it credit for (22:19 - 22:23)
like I can sit here and say Vault of (22:21 - 22:25)
Glass was easy for me and continues to (22:23 - 22:28)
be easy for me but like (22:25 - 22:31)
that doesn't mean that (22:28 - 22:33)
it's going to be easy for somebody's (22:31 - 22:35)
like somebody else doing it for the (22:33 - 22:36)
first time even though I'm just like (22:35 - 22:38)
stand here and shoot this like it's (22:36 - 22:40)
there's still a lot going on there's (22:38 - 22:41)
still a lot happening there's still a (22:40 - 22:43)
lot people don't like like (22:41 - 22:45)
to this day there are still people who (22:43 - 22:47)
like you know belly drum is the easy (22:45 - 22:48)
Strat right you just hit belly drum and (22:47 - 22:50)
then you hit play rough and like the (22:48 - 22:52)
people who hit belly drum like seconds (22:50 - 22:54)
before Charizard is about to set up his (22:52 - 22:56)
shield which wipes your belly drum out (22:54 - 22:59)
like that's still happening like they're (22:56 - 23:00)
they're just fundamentals of the raid (22:59 - 23:04)
that people aren't doing and (23:00 - 23:04)
I I don't I think could Charizard have (23:04 - 23:08)
been harder yeah maybe like if they gave (23:07 - 23:10)
it metal claw or they gave it Thunder (23:08 - 23:12)
Punch or they gave it solar beam could (23:10 - 23:14)
that have been possibly more difficult (23:12 - 23:15)
sure (23:14 - 23:19)
but I think it was difficult enough (23:15 - 23:21)
yeah I think it was difficult I just I (23:19 - 23:25)
just shy away from saying majority had a (23:21 - 23:26)
problem with it I I don't feel (23:25 - 23:28)
comfortable saying that (23:26 - 23:31)
uh based off of my very limited in your (23:28 - 23:33)
limited experiences like it what I would (23:31 - 23:36)
like is to see something official give (23:33 - 23:38)
me the numbers yeah yeah yeah tell us (23:36 - 23:40)
what happened so that we can (23:38 - 23:43)
appropriately advise people or you can (23:40 - 23:44)
get the word out there saying the (23:43 - 23:48)
majority of you didn't do or couldn't do (23:44 - 23:52)
Charizard appropriately here's (23:48 - 23:54)
stuff like it'd be it'd be nice if if (23:52 - 23:56)
they decided to help people play their (23:54 - 23:59)
game every once in a while well they did (23:56 - 24:01)
they did they they put out a little uh (23:59 - 24:03)
good transition they put out braid (24:01 - 24:05)
battle tips I will say the nice thing (24:03 - 24:08)
about like PlayStation games Destiny or (24:05 - 24:10)
not Destiny right (24:08 - 24:11)
um You can go to the trophies and you (24:10 - 24:13)
can look so you can go to like Destiny (24:11 - 24:15)
one scroll down and you can go like oh (24:13 - 24:18)
only five percent of people beat Vault (24:15 - 24:21)
of Glass one out of 20 people who have (24:18 - 24:23)
purchased your game has experienced the (24:21 - 24:25)
best content that your game had to offer (24:23 - 24:27)
which (24:25 - 24:29)
maybe they're happy with that yeah (24:27 - 24:32)
they're generally happy with that (24:29 - 24:35)
like just being like the team that (24:32 - 24:37)
worked on like that raid or the team (24:35 - 24:39)
that works on specifically these raids (24:37 - 24:41)
in in Sword and or scarlet and (24:39 - 24:42)
violet like (24:41 - 24:45)
you would hope that more people (24:42 - 24:48)
experience the thing you've worked on (24:45 - 24:50)
oh it depends on what they how they make (24:48 - 24:53)
it like I recently found out that you (24:50 - 24:55)
know like most people don't do Savage (24:53 - 24:57)
rage and Final Fantasy 14 right like (24:55 - 25:00)
that is but it turns out that they make (24:57 - 25:02)
the Savage raids first (25:00 - 25:04)
and then downgrade it for the theme then (25:02 - 25:07)
downgrades it for the normal version so (25:04 - 25:10)
like the people who tend to develop them (25:07 - 25:12)
will make are also the ones who make the (25:10 - 25:14)
iterations for it so (25:12 - 25:16)
yeah they probably like yeah no I worked (25:14 - 25:18)
on on these aspects of it and enough (25:16 - 25:20)
people saw it and I'm happy with that (25:18 - 25:22)
and the hardcore people who I was (25:20 - 25:24)
building this for got their hardcore (25:22 - 25:26)
experience and we know that's a small (25:24 - 25:28)
amount of people (25:26 - 25:28)
uh well so the article that the Pokemon (25:32 - 25:37)
company put out which was December 22nd (25:35 - 25:39)
so yesterday as of recording this we're (25:37 - 25:42)
recording on the 23rd (25:39 - 25:45)
um it talks about uh well it talks about (25:42 - 25:46)
the different kind of raids we'll skip (25:45 - 25:50)
that we one through seven uh it then (25:46 - 25:52)
goes on about training your Pokemon (25:50 - 25:55)
uh so it says getting your team to level (25:52 - 25:56)
100 may seem but like a challenge but (25:55 - 25:59)
battling uh (25:56 - 26:01)
battling Pokemon that award a lot of (25:59 - 26:03)
experience points like Chansey or using (26:01 - 26:05)
experience candy from tarot raids will (26:03 - 26:07)
help your Pokemon level up faster when (26:05 - 26:08)
it comes to base points you can use (26:07 - 26:11)
items like power weight so they're not (26:08 - 26:12)
at this point they're not even (26:11 - 26:14)
mentioning EVS they're saying base (26:12 - 26:17)
points but EVS uh that can be purchased (26:14 - 26:19)
from the Delhi bird location to speed up (26:17 - 26:21)
the training process they for whatever (26:19 - 26:23)
reason did not use the word vitamins (26:21 - 26:24)
here (26:23 - 26:29)
I don't know why okay so it says uh you (26:24 - 26:31)
want to consider Pokemon most effective (26:29 - 26:34)
uh for battle for example the (26:31 - 26:36)
yeah this is the part I wanted was (26:34 - 26:38)
waiting for you to get to because it (26:36 - 26:39)
gets even better further down yeah say (26:38 - 26:43)
it for example this is Pokemon words not (26:39 - 26:45)
mine you want a strong physical attacker (26:43 - 26:47)
like a zoomerul it would benefit from an (26:45 - 26:50)
adamant nature while a spilled skilled (26:47 - 26:52)
special attacker like Sylveon would get (26:50 - 26:56)
more mileage out of a modest nature (26:52 - 26:57)
so (26:56 - 27:00)
in that sense like in that sentence like (26:57 - 27:05)
sure like as Zuma rule is is a physical (27:00 - 27:07)
attacker and should have an adamant (27:05 - 27:10)
nature right Sylveon is a special (27:07 - 27:12)
attacker should have (27:10 - 27:15)
a modest nature (27:12 - 27:17)
um I think this article is really not (27:15 - 27:20)
helpful at all uh oh but also they (27:17 - 27:23)
literally picked a Pokemon that has a (27:20 - 27:26)
base attack set of 50. (27:23 - 27:28)
like there's a reason as zoomeral is (27:26 - 27:30)
good and they're they're not even like (27:28 - 27:33)
listing it here which is which is a (27:30 - 27:35)
problem in itself now again (27:33 - 27:38)
uh like the somebody's gonna be like (27:35 - 27:40)
well if they watched so and so on (27:38 - 27:43)
YouTube they would know and it's like (27:40 - 27:45)
the the Pokemon if the Pokemon company (27:43 - 27:48)
is gonna have the the (27:45 - 27:49)
they're gonna write an article they're (27:48 - 27:52)
leaving so much information out here (27:49 - 27:55)
it's so misleading (27:52 - 27:56)
um because I think the people who (27:55 - 27:58)
already were looking up YouTubers they (27:56 - 28:00)
were doing it way before this article (27:58 - 28:03)
existed oh yes (28:00 - 28:04)
um (28:03 - 28:06)
supportive Pokemon like Umbreon or (28:04 - 28:08)
Blissey should consider Nature's for (28:06 - 28:10)
their uh strengths including calm or (28:08 - 28:12)
careful Natures you can catch a breed (28:10 - 28:14)
Pokemon with these specific Natures you (28:12 - 28:16)
can use mints uh mints can be purchased (28:14 - 28:19)
from all the Chansey Supply locations (28:16 - 28:20)
um (28:19 - 28:23)
and then they say approaching tight (28:20 - 28:25)
matchups here it seems appealing to (28:23 - 28:27)
choose a grass type Pokemon to counter a (28:25 - 28:29)
Talonflame that has water Terror type (28:27 - 28:30)
but it's important to remember the types (28:29 - 28:32)
of moves a Pokemon Talonflame might have (28:30 - 28:35)
that sentence is really good yeah uh (28:32 - 28:36)
grass moves will hit Talonflame with (28:35 - 28:38)
super effective but most of talonflame's (28:36 - 28:39)
moves are probably going to be fire or (28:38 - 28:41)
flying which would deal super effective (28:39 - 28:43)
damage right back at grass Pokemon again (28:41 - 28:45)
I think this whole paragraph is good in (28:43 - 28:46)
this case an electric type Pokemon like (28:45 - 28:49)
me ride on is particularly strong it can (28:46 - 28:51)
deal super effective damage or resist (28:49 - 28:52)
flying type moves like Brave Bird (28:51 - 28:55)
staying in the battle is just as (28:52 - 28:57)
important as doing damage which I agree (28:55 - 28:59)
with that's a really great line so (28:57 - 29:00)
picking a Pokemon with effective (28:59 - 29:03)
defensive typing goes a long way for (29:00 - 29:06)
coming out Victorious (29:03 - 29:08)
uh (29:06 - 29:10)
battling and cheering every battle (29:08 - 29:12)
requires its own strategy uh there's (29:10 - 29:13)
times to bring a damage dealing Pokemon (29:12 - 29:16)
like a zoomerul but there's uh also time (29:13 - 29:18)
to support the rest of your squad with a (29:16 - 29:21)
defensive-like Pokemon like Blissey uh (29:18 - 29:22)
if your teammates are choosing a Pokemon (29:21 - 29:24)
like Berserker or Umbreon with (29:22 - 29:26)
supportive moves like Screech it is (29:24 - 29:27)
probably best to pick a Pokemon like a (29:26 - 29:29)
zoomero that can take advantage of stat (29:27 - 29:32)
decreasing moves also really helpful (29:29 - 29:33)
sentence there (29:32 - 29:37)
um if you're if your team has already uh (29:33 - 29:39)
has the damage covered with strong (29:37 - 29:41)
Pokemon to deal super effective attacks (29:39 - 29:44)
bringing a Pokemon with defensive moves (29:41 - 29:46)
like light screen or reflect in addition (29:44 - 29:47)
to moves like metal sound or Screech (29:46 - 29:50)
will have a positive impact in picking (29:47 - 29:52)
other strong Pokemon a million percent (29:50 - 29:53)
agree again (29:52 - 29:56)
where we're two for three out of like (29:53 - 29:59)
paragraphs here (29:56 - 30:02)
uh so cheering is another element this (29:59 - 30:04)
is a another thing that I've noticed (30:02 - 30:09)
multiple people do not hit or press (30:04 - 30:11)
um cheering doesn't charge your Terra (30:09 - 30:13)
orb which requires you to land three (30:11 - 30:15)
attacks before it can be activated but (30:13 - 30:16)
it can help your teammates deal damage (30:15 - 30:18)
by boosting offensive power keeping him (30:16 - 30:20)
on the field keeping everyone in battle (30:18 - 30:23)
indirectly speeds up terasalizing and (30:20 - 30:25)
ensures that the time needed complete (30:23 - 30:26)
Terror raid battles doesn't deplete too (30:25 - 30:29)
quickly so they they say cheering helps (30:26 - 30:30)
but they don't talk anything about it (30:29 - 30:34)
but what it does it helps figure it out (30:30 - 30:37)
okay so again this is (30:34 - 30:39)
these are the Pokemon they're (30:37 - 30:42)
recommending and this is this is just (30:39 - 30:45)
bad it's just not great say it say the (30:42 - 30:47)
first one so the first one they (30:45 - 30:49)
recommend is a zoomar roll with with (30:47 - 30:53)
super power belly drum liquidation and (30:49 - 30:55)
play rough (30:53 - 30:58)
Fitness we'll get to all of these the (30:55 - 31:00)
next Pokemon is Umbreon with light (30:58 - 31:02)
screen reflect Screech and taunt (31:00 - 31:05)
uh then you have uh Blissey with life do (31:02 - 31:08)
light screen reflect tail whip this is (31:05 - 31:11)
such a bad move set holy cow uh we'll (31:08 - 31:14)
get to that in a second uh Garchomp (31:11 - 31:16)
earthquake outrage Rockside Swords Dance (31:14 - 31:18)
Berserker with Iron Head Screech sword (31:16 - 31:21)
Sans taunt Corydon with Collision Course (31:18 - 31:24)
drain punch Screech Swords Dance and me (31:21 - 31:26)
ride on with electrodrift metal sound (31:24 - 31:29)
parabolic para block whatever that (31:26 - 31:35)
parabolic charge and then taunt (31:29 - 31:35)
so my number one problem with this is (31:35 - 31:40)
there there are no abilities listed (31:38 - 31:43)
which uh in the case of a zoomerul is (31:40 - 31:46)
incredibly important (31:43 - 31:50)
it's also it's breaking the game (31:46 - 31:50)
uh yes also uh well I don't think it's (31:50 - 31:55)
specifically I think it's (31:53 - 31:57)
play rough that's the problem well what (31:55 - 31:59)
I've heard it's the play rough combined (31:57 - 32:02)
with huge power it can't calculate it (31:59 - 32:03)
currently can't calculate the damage (32:02 - 32:07)
correctly and so it freaks out and makes (32:03 - 32:08)
the HB bar (32:07 - 32:10)
go out because there's something wrong (32:08 - 32:11)
with the calculation that it's doing (32:10 - 32:14)
right now (32:11 - 32:14)
yeah I I don't know I I feel like I've (32:14 - 32:18)
been in plenty of raids without a Zuma (32:17 - 32:20)
Rule and the HP bar is still freaking (32:18 - 32:22)
out yeah I mean the HPR bar is freaking (32:20 - 32:24)
out but like the situation where I was (32:22 - 32:25)
running into where I had three Zoom role (32:24 - 32:27)
and they all did play rough with huge (32:25 - 32:29)
power and the game was just like made it (32:27 - 32:31)
extra broken I don't know I'm just gonna (32:29 - 32:33)
fill this up but it'll be twice as long (32:31 - 32:36)
now so yeah no like like I I have done (32:33 - 32:39)
I I have done I have been with belly (32:36 - 32:41)
drums the Titans I have been with belly (32:39 - 32:44)
drum iron hands I have been with belly (32:41 - 32:47)
drum Charizards like I have I I have (32:44 - 32:49)
been in a million different situations (32:47 - 32:52)
where the HP bar has freaked out yeah (32:49 - 32:55)
so the the whole problem with this (32:52 - 32:59)
Zoomer array is one going back to that (32:55 - 33:00)
first paragraph they recommend Azuma (32:59 - 33:03)
roll which is like their zoomer's attack (33:00 - 33:05)
set is terrible it's really bad it's (33:03 - 33:08)
based at 50. uh I made a joke that (33:05 - 33:10)
tinkerton I know people love tinkerton (33:08 - 33:12)
but it has a terrible attack statue it's (33:10 - 33:16)
attacks that is 70 which is not great (33:12 - 33:17)
um just for reference the Pokemon I like (33:16 - 33:20)
to reference here is crabby Krabby has (33:17 - 33:23)
an attack stat of 105. (33:20 - 33:27)
crabby but Krabby is ugly and take a ton (33:23 - 33:29)
is awesome uh crabby goes cookie cookie (33:27 - 33:31)
cookie in the anime ticket tongue has a (33:29 - 33:34)
giant hammer and will end Your Existence (33:31 - 33:36)
she does too bad she doesn't have the (33:34 - 33:37)
strength to use it (33:36 - 33:40)
just fine 50 which is really bad the (33:37 - 33:42)
reason that it's good is because it (33:40 - 33:44)
needs belly drum but also because of its (33:42 - 33:46)
ability huge power nowhere in here did (33:44 - 33:49)
they reference huge power so (33:46 - 33:52)
or or even explain the process of belly (33:49 - 33:56)
drum right like yeah like like they they (33:52 - 33:57)
phoned as much as they could in before (33:56 - 34:00)
going out for the holiday (33:57 - 34:01)
um I'm around with like a light screen (34:00 - 34:05)
reflect Screech taunt that's like fine I (34:01 - 34:07)
guess uh my problem here is blissy with (34:05 - 34:09)
light screen reflect (34:07 - 34:12)
uh and tail whip like there's there's (34:09 - 34:16)
literally no reason in the entire world (34:12 - 34:19)
where you would ever want Blissey to (34:16 - 34:23)
have reflect maybe I guess maybe if the (34:19 - 34:26)
Pokemon you're fighting against is (34:23 - 34:30)
a mixed attacker but even in that case (34:26 - 34:33)
don't bring blissy bring a different (34:30 - 34:35)
Pokemon like bro I'm honestly bring (34:33 - 34:36)
Umbreon (34:35 - 34:40)
um just to talk about numbers again (34:36 - 34:43)
Blissey has uh an HP stat of (34:40 - 34:47)
255 incredibly High eight blissey's (34:43 - 34:49)
attack stat is 10. (34:47 - 34:52)
so azumerose attack set is 50. (34:50 - 34:55)
tinkerton's attack stat is 70. (34:52 - 34:57)
krabby's attack stat is 105 for whatever (34:55 - 34:58)
reason (34:57 - 35:00)
felicity's is 10. I'm going to skip (34:58 - 35:02)
blissy's defense stat for a second (35:00 - 35:05)
blissey's special attack 75. (35:02 - 35:07)
also higher than tinkerton's physical (35:05 - 35:10)
attacks that you know not that you would (35:07 - 35:12)
ever use Blissey to attack but you could (35:10 - 35:15)
would you quit picking on my girl now (35:12 - 35:18)
unless he's a special defense stat is (35:15 - 35:21)
135. it's incredibly High that's very (35:18 - 35:25)
good so tied with the special defense (35:21 - 35:29)
and the HP Blissey is a special wall it (35:25 - 35:31)
is very hard for a Pokemon like (35:29 - 35:33)
Charizard using special type moves to (35:31 - 35:35)
knock out Blissey that's why Blissey was (35:33 - 35:37)
pretty decent for Charizard raids also (35:35 - 35:39)
Blissey has access to life do which this (35:37 - 35:41)
article recommends which gives you (35:39 - 35:42)
healing without wasting one of your (35:41 - 35:43)
cheers (35:42 - 35:45)
okay let's go back to blissey's attack (35:43 - 35:46)
stat (35:45 - 35:49)
it's 10. (35:46 - 35:56)
10. it is it is so incredibly low uh you (35:49 - 35:58)
would never ever want to bring this to a (35:56 - 35:59)
physical raid so the fact that this (35:58 - 36:01)
article is like yeah put reflect on (35:59 - 36:04)
Blissey did you mean defense stat (36:01 - 36:06)
yeah I said defense that what did I say (36:04 - 36:08)
attack stat oh my bad it's attacking (36:06 - 36:09)
it's defensive the same they're both (36:08 - 36:14)
done they're both bad uh (36:09 - 36:14)
it's it's just not a great article but (36:15 - 36:20)
anyways the the whole point of (36:18 - 36:23)
like like there are no abilities here (36:20 - 36:25)
they don't mention the word vitamins at (36:23 - 36:29)
all they like just kind of reference (36:25 - 36:31)
that maybe you should know about EVs and (36:29 - 36:33)
they're like yeah buy these Power brace (36:31 - 36:36)
like they don't like this article is so (36:33 - 36:40)
terrible for (36:36 - 36:42)
what they're trying to communicate yes (36:40 - 36:44)
it's terrible for helping people who (36:42 - 36:46)
don't understand the mechanics that have (36:44 - 36:48)
existed for a while it's good but at (36:46 - 36:49)
explaining the new things for the most (36:48 - 36:52)
part it's good at explaining how tarot (36:49 - 36:54)
works it's good at uh at least (36:52 - 36:57)
mentioning that the cheers exist (36:54 - 36:59)
but anything that there are already (36:57 - 37:02)
plenty of resources out there for this (36:59 - 37:04)
is bad (37:02 - 37:04)
anyone should be providing proper (37:07 - 37:10)
resources it should probably be (37:08 - 37:12)
pokemon.com right like they have had (37:10 - 37:16)
good articles in the past uh they (37:12 - 37:18)
partnered with uh goof (37:16 - 37:20)
who was a pretty popular unite player at (37:18 - 37:22)
the time I don't know if he even plays (37:20 - 37:25)
unite anymore uh but when unite was like (37:22 - 37:27)
super big they interviewed him they (37:25 - 37:29)
talked about strategies they've they've (37:27 - 37:32)
worked with Aaron Zhang before uh who is (37:29 - 37:34)
a commentator for the Pokemon company uh (37:32 - 37:37)
he has written articles I don't know who (37:34 - 37:39)
wrote this article (37:37 - 37:41)
uh but it's not great I think this (37:39 - 37:44)
article does more damage more damage (37:41 - 37:46)
than than good here like I don't think (37:44 - 37:47)
there's enough good in this article (37:46 - 37:49)
where I would I would feel confident to (37:47 - 37:51)
recommend it to somebody and be like yep (37:49 - 37:52)
look at these lists because you would (37:51 - 37:54)
look at like the azumar role and you'd (37:52 - 37:55)
be like (37:54 - 37:58)
okay well it says I need adamant nature (37:55 - 38:00)
um it doesn't say where my EVS should be (37:58 - 38:03)
it doesn't say what nature I should have (38:00 - 38:05)
it doesn't say what held item would be (38:03 - 38:06)
good it doesn't even mention held items (38:05 - 38:11)
at all in this entire thing uh (38:06 - 38:14)
and this goes back to like why I I don't (38:11 - 38:16)
have faith in people beating Charizard (38:14 - 38:19)
is because I did (38:16 - 38:22)
I did a haunch girl raid six star haunch (38:19 - 38:24)
Crow six stars are not as hard as seven (38:22 - 38:27)
right uh statistically on the on the the (38:24 - 38:29)
star scale seven is harder than six (38:27 - 38:31)
ideally (38:29 - 38:37)
um and so haunch Crow is flying dark (38:31 - 38:39)
or maybe it's dark flying I don't know (38:37 - 38:41)
one of the two (38:39 - 38:47)
and it's Terror type was steel (38:41 - 38:48)
okay (38:47 - 38:52)
got it making sense so I before before (38:48 - 38:55)
it's officially dark flying thank you so (38:52 - 38:57)
before I went to the raid I looked at (38:55 - 38:59)
the move set which I think is part of (38:57 - 39:01)
the problem with some of these rates is (38:59 - 39:05)
if you knew the move set going into a (39:01 - 39:07)
six star raid you could make a better (39:05 - 39:09)
educated choice of what Pokemon to bring (39:07 - 39:11)
unless we go back to my first problem (39:09 - 39:12)
which I brought up in the beginning of (39:11 - 39:15)
this episode where people don't know (39:12 - 39:17)
what Pokemon to build (39:15 - 39:19)
and so therefore they just don't build (39:17 - 39:22)
one right like if like (39:19 - 39:23)
some people just want a list like (39:22 - 39:27)
pokemon.com has provided uh but this (39:23 - 39:29)
list is bad (39:27 - 39:33)
so I was like okay here are the this is (39:29 - 39:35)
the move set for hauncher I read it out (39:33 - 39:37)
loud it knew five moves it knew a dark (39:35 - 39:40)
type move and knew a flying type move it (39:37 - 39:43)
knew like Roost I think it knew taunt it (39:40 - 39:46)
knew like Tailwind right it wasn't a (39:43 - 39:48)
very diverse moveset didn't have any (39:46 - 39:51)
Steel type moves (39:48 - 39:53)
uh because most I still think it's odd (39:51 - 39:56)
that not all Pokemon no Terra Blast (39:53 - 39:57)
because they could just know Terra Blast (39:56 - 39:59)
so they can take advantage of their (39:57 - 40:01)
random Terror type that's fine (39:59 - 40:02)
um (40:01 - 40:04)
and so what what I I was like please (40:02 - 40:06)
bring level 100 (40:04 - 40:09)
you know it's weak it's steel you know (40:06 - 40:12)
it doesn't have any Steel type moves (40:09 - 40:15)
three Charizards thank you my twitch (40:12 - 40:17)
chat three Charizards showed up in my in (40:15 - 40:20)
my RAID and I was like well at least I (40:17 - 40:23)
know they're level 100 right because you (40:20 - 40:26)
caught the Charizard and I was like ah (40:23 - 40:29)
well it has Focus blast that's a (40:26 - 40:30)
fighting type move that's super (40:29 - 40:32)
effective against Steel and you know (40:30 - 40:34)
Charizard takes neutral damage from (40:32 - 40:37)
flying type moves and it takes you know (40:34 - 40:40)
neutral damage from dark type moves so (40:37 - 40:43)
that's not the worst choice (40:40 - 40:45)
I then proceeded to watch all three (40:43 - 40:48)
Charizards not cheer not boost their (40:45 - 40:51)
stats just they all hit Focus blast and (40:48 - 40:52)
they tickle tickle tickle the haunch (40:51 - 40:54)
crow because it didn't really do any (40:52 - 40:56)
damage because you know Focus blast (40:54 - 40:58)
isn't a stab from Charizard same type (40:56 - 41:00)
attack bonus and then I just watched all (40:58 - 41:02)
three Charizards faint and then we lost (41:00 - 41:04)
the raid (41:02 - 41:07)
and I was like no I don't have any faith (41:04 - 41:11)
in people beating Charizard because how (41:07 - 41:13)
how did this happen so fast in This (41:11 - 41:15)
haunch Crew I mean you are also you are (41:13 - 41:17)
also ignoring the fact that people like (41:15 - 41:19)
to troll you (41:17 - 41:22)
I yeah (41:19 - 41:22)
multiple times I don't think they were (41:23 - 41:27)
trolling (41:25 - 41:29)
I think at least one person wasn't (41:27 - 41:30)
trolling and they were like Charizard is (41:29 - 41:32)
my best option I mean some of them are (41:30 - 41:34)
like Charizard my best you said I had to (41:32 - 41:36)
bring somebody that's level 100 and they (41:34 - 41:39)
want to be on on the screen yeah it (41:36 - 41:41)
doesn't want to troll you like like (41:39 - 41:43)
let's not make business cases off of (41:41 - 41:45)
your one trip stream (41:43 - 41:47)
I'm not why I don't know why you keep (41:45 - 41:50)
saying this I like do you think I live (41:47 - 41:51)
in this bubble of just my own twitch (41:50 - 41:53)
stream no like I literally watch (41:51 - 41:56)
examples a lot yeah of course because (41:53 - 41:58)
they're personal experiences yeah it (41:56 - 42:00)
literally consumes so much Pokemon (41:58 - 42:02)
content I still watch so many other (42:00 - 42:05)
creators I I I I I'm on Tick Tock I'm on (42:02 - 42:06)
YouTube I'm on Twitter like I'm not in (42:05 - 42:08)
this nutshell of my own twitch stream (42:06 - 42:11)
girl like literally watch like go go (42:08 - 42:13)
tonight go on tonight on Twitch watch 10 (42:11 - 42:14)
creators I bet you'll see the same thing (42:13 - 42:16)
go on YouTube watch a bunch of videos I (42:14 - 42:18)
bet you did the same thing constant tick (42:16 - 42:21)
tocks it like like I'm trying to bring (42:18 - 42:22)
up examples of people struggling in (42:21 - 42:24)
raids because literally people are (42:22 - 42:26)
struggling in right they are I I agree (42:24 - 42:29)
so like I'm not in this like bubble of (42:26 - 42:32)
like well it's just your viewers (42:29 - 42:32)
my viewers are building the Pokemon that (42:33 - 42:35)
I recommend they have really good (42:34 - 42:38)
counters like I rarely see a zoom rolls (42:35 - 42:39)
because my my viewers have moved away (42:38 - 42:43)
from azumel to have better counters (42:39 - 42:43)
like I think there is a deeper issue (42:43 - 42:47)
here of people not understanding Terror (42:45 - 42:48)
raid battles and I'm doing everything I (42:47 - 42:50)
can to make sure people have a better (42:48 - 42:52)
experience because like I said weeks ago (42:50 - 42:54)
and why I continue to say is no one (42:52 - 42:56)
wants to join a terror Raid Battle (42:54 - 42:58)
because they don't want to be the weak (42:56 - 43:00)
link so they would rather just skip out (42:58 - 43:01)
on the terror raid and not do it with (43:00 - 43:03)
people we had that experience last night (43:01 - 43:05)
where somebody was like I really can't (43:03 - 43:06)
beat this armor Rouge and I want to (43:05 - 43:07)
catch this armor Rouge because I saw (43:06 - 43:08)
your graphic for cinderase and I was (43:07 - 43:10)
like cool let me help you out and they (43:08 - 43:13)
were like I'm really bad I don't want to (43:10 - 43:14)
embarrass myself and I was like I do not (43:13 - 43:16)
care if we lose five times in a row I (43:14 - 43:17)
want to make sure you get this raid done (43:16 - 43:19)
because I want you to catch this Pokemon (43:17 - 43:22)
like people are so like there is such a (43:19 - 43:24)
stigma around video games where any time (43:22 - 43:26)
there is a co-op or a group experience (43:24 - 43:28)
people do not want to feel like they are (43:26 - 43:29)
bringing down the entire team so they (43:28 - 43:32)
just rather pass on the content and I am (43:29 - 43:33)
doing everything I can to make sure (43:32 - 43:35)
people enjoy the game to the fullest so (43:33 - 43:36)
it is really frustrating when you're (43:35 - 43:37)
like well you're just living in a (43:36 - 43:39)
nutshell you're just living in your own (43:37 - 43:41)
world it's just your Twitch chat like (43:39 - 43:42)
I'm trying so hard to make these people (43:41 - 43:44)
feel welcomed and to make these people (43:42 - 43:45)
feel educated and to make these people (43:44 - 43:48)
feel like they can do the raids uh by (43:45 - 43:50)
themselves or with other people or take (43:48 - 43:51)
that information and give it on to (43:50 - 43:53)
friends (43:51 - 43:53)
and it's really frustrating to see (43:54 - 43:58)
pokemon.com making things even harder (43:56 - 44:00)
yes (43:58 - 44:00)
um so anyways I I have Cinder Ace (44:03 - 44:10)
counters uh on YouTube on Instagram uh I (44:06 - 44:11)
think I think those are best although (44:10 - 44:13)
although we don't know cinderace's exact (44:11 - 44:15)
move set (44:13 - 44:17)
um it is possible that cinderace does (44:15 - 44:19)
cinderize does learn one electric type (44:17 - 44:22)
move uh although it's it's a special (44:19 - 44:26)
attack in Cedar race is physical attack (44:22 - 44:29)
um is incredibly high so even through my (44:26 - 44:30)
damage calculations if you brought a (44:29 - 44:32)
Pokemon like pelipper which is four (44:30 - 44:35)
times weak to Electric uh the electro (44:32 - 44:38)
ball that cinderace could learn uh would (44:35 - 44:39)
not be able to knock pelipper out it (44:38 - 44:42)
would be about like 98 it would be very (44:39 - 44:43)
very close but (44:42 - 44:45)
um that would be like (44:43 - 44:48)
the most damaging situation so I I don't (44:45 - 44:50)
think that cinderace would have electro (44:48 - 44:52)
ball (44:50 - 44:53)
um I I think it's very safe that's in (44:52 - 44:54)
the race has like high jump kick (44:53 - 44:57)
obviously pyro ball probably Iron Head (44:54 - 44:59)
um but (44:57 - 45:04)
it's coming around twice so uh (44:59 - 45:05)
if (45:04 - 45:06)
if (45:05 - 45:09)
cinderace has some wild moveset uh we (45:06 - 45:11)
can we can we can tweak but I think (45:09 - 45:14)
we'll learn about it that first week (45:11 - 45:16)
but what about it that first day if it's (45:14 - 45:19)
got something real weird yeah and I I (45:16 - 45:20)
think the the great thing about these (45:19 - 45:23)
Seven Star raids is that (45:20 - 45:25)
um the rewards are really good so it (45:23 - 45:28)
does encourage you to help people I mean (45:25 - 45:29)
you could just do one and done which (45:28 - 45:32)
yeah well also I think (45:29 - 45:33)
I know there's a lot of people who are (45:32 - 45:36)
like I don't see them and you do have to (45:33 - 45:37)
have had like if you're looking for (45:36 - 45:39)
random raids (45:37 - 45:42)
or raids on your own map you do have to (45:39 - 45:44)
unlock six star rates (45:42 - 45:45)
I know a lot of people are like I never (45:44 - 45:47)
see them I'm like did you do the six (45:45 - 45:50)
star raid unlock (45:47 - 45:51)
because you're not going to see them (45:50 - 45:53)
they're not going to appear on your map (45:51 - 45:56)
yes once six star raids appear you will (45:53 - 45:59)
see seven star but like I said like I (45:56 - 46:00)
said you could you could just join (45:59 - 46:01)
somebody's right like you could just but (46:00 - 46:03)
I mean you have to join somebody with a (46:01 - 46:05)
code right like it positively go looking (46:03 - 46:06)
yeah you have to go look for it because (46:05 - 46:08)
I know there's a lot of people like I'm (46:06 - 46:11)
in the random map and it's never showing (46:08 - 46:12)
up (46:11 - 46:14)
you have to have a code (46:12 - 46:16)
to join them they will not show up (46:14 - 46:18)
randomly either they didn't show up (46:16 - 46:20)
randomly for me until I unlocked six (46:18 - 46:21)
stars and then suddenly they were there (46:20 - 46:25)
so if if you are watching somebody or (46:21 - 46:27)
you have a friend who has them unlocked (46:25 - 46:29)
you need to work with them to get a code (46:27 - 46:31)
because then you can just join but if (46:29 - 46:33)
you have not unlocked six star raids (46:31 - 46:36)
they will not appear on your map and (46:33 - 46:39)
they will not appear in your random list (46:36 - 46:41)
uh also what I would say this was a (46:39 - 46:42)
thing that came from sword and shield (46:41 - 46:44)
still works here uh as long as you don't (46:42 - 46:46)
connect to the internet (46:44 - 46:48)
um once cinderace is gone he will he (46:46 - 46:51)
will stay uh so I was able to do like a (46:48 - 46:53)
Charizard on Monday which was like (46:51 - 46:54)
non-stop people being like how do you (46:53 - 46:55)
still have Charizard as long as you (46:54 - 46:56)
don't connect to the internet you're (46:55 - 46:57)
good (46:56 - 46:58)
um so you can get like one extra Cinder (46:57 - 47:00)
race on Monday (46:58 - 47:02)
um which you'd have to solo it but it's (47:00 - 47:04)
good practice if you want to try solo (47:02 - 47:05)
um (47:04 - 47:08)
uh and also well also frustrating (47:05 - 47:12)
because you'll learn how the NPCs uh oh (47:08 - 47:15)
there's a roll of a dice with the NPCs (47:12 - 47:19)
the NPCs can sometimes be really good (47:15 - 47:22)
yeah I mean like I think I think overall (47:19 - 47:24)
I'm gonna say I think overall the NPCs (47:22 - 47:26)
in this game are better than the words (47:24 - 47:29)
sword and shields yeah I agree with you (47:26 - 47:30)
I don't have a I don't have a Martin (47:29 - 47:32)
experience yet (47:30 - 47:36)
I well Martin would make the game better (47:32 - 47:36)
Maybe (47:38 - 47:43)
maybe I I think I think Larry should (47:40 - 47:45)
just join every once in a while and just (47:43 - 47:47)
be there like they made me come wasn't (47:45 - 47:48)
there something in the crown Tundra (47:47 - 47:50)
where like (47:48 - 47:53)
people did join your raid yeah every (47:50 - 47:54)
once in a while on the crown tender you (47:53 - 47:57)
would get uh you would get a big like a (47:54 - 48:00)
big and Clarissa would like Joy Marvin (47:57 - 48:02)
and closer would jump in and one other (48:00 - 48:04)
who would sometimes jump in I forget who (48:02 - 48:05)
but yeah every once while you'd be like (48:04 - 48:09)
oh look a famous person joined my RAID I (48:05 - 48:10)
think I think the problem with solo (48:09 - 48:13)
raids and uh well Hannah can you explain (48:10 - 48:15)
your experience you said you tried to (48:13 - 48:18)
solo and it didn't work with NPCs (48:15 - 48:21)
um gosh yeah I didn't try very hard (48:18 - 48:23)
building I mean I I built let's see (48:21 - 48:25)
you're talking about Charizard right (48:23 - 48:28)
yeah you said you tried sour charts (48:25 - 48:30)
you tried Charizard solo it didn't work (48:28 - 48:33)
you came into twitch and then I was able (48:30 - 48:35)
to help you out I am I am still kind of (48:33 - 48:36)
new to the thinking about Pokemon (48:35 - 48:38)
competitively I have tried here and (48:36 - 48:41)
there but have always been way too busy (48:38 - 48:42)
with school and stuff just haven't been (48:41 - 48:44)
in a point in my life where I could (48:42 - 48:46)
focus on that so I am just starting to (48:44 - 48:48)
now I built one of the pretzel dogs (48:46 - 48:51)
based off of your graphic I put all of (48:48 - 48:53)
the Right Moves on it Evie trained it a (48:51 - 48:55)
little bit and (48:53 - 48:58)
uh I mean (48:55 - 49:01)
I probably didn't have the right tactics (48:58 - 49:03)
I didn't I wasn't timing it right like (49:01 - 49:04)
you've been talking about with the (49:03 - 49:08)
shield and the breaking the (49:04 - 49:11)
um attack defense boosts all of that so (49:08 - 49:13)
that was probably something I did wrong (49:11 - 49:15)
it's very possible it was on me and not (49:13 - 49:18)
on the NPCs but I have had some better (49:15 - 49:21)
experiences with NPCs and some worse (49:18 - 49:23)
experience with experiences with NPCs it (49:21 - 49:25)
kind of it really is a roll of the dice (49:23 - 49:27)
sometimes they have a Pokemon that's (49:25 - 49:28)
super effective (49:27 - 49:30)
sometimes they definitely definitely do (49:28 - 49:33)
not yeah I mean the NPCs in my (49:30 - 49:36)
experience because I've done a lot of on (49:33 - 49:37)
my own stuff and it did I did one (49:36 - 49:40)
Charizard one on my own (49:37 - 49:43)
um and (49:40 - 49:43)
it's weird if you (49:43 - 49:47)
sometimes like if you're just not (49:45 - 49:49)
attacker they're doing all the cheers (49:47 - 49:51)
and sometimes if you're doing the cheers (49:49 - 49:53)
they like are just all-out attackers so (49:51 - 49:55)
you kind of have to pay attention to (49:53 - 49:58)
what your NPCs are doing if you can even (49:55 - 50:00)
see it yeah but the problem is of course (49:58 - 50:02)
sometimes you just can't see it right (50:00 - 50:03)
like sometimes you just have no clue (50:02 - 50:06)
what anybody's doing because you can't (50:03 - 50:09)
see or you're stuck at a menu but I (50:06 - 50:10)
think (50:09 - 50:13)
overall I have there's a couple of (50:10 - 50:15)
things that people I've talked to who (50:13 - 50:17)
have various success who do very very (50:15 - 50:21)
successful solo raids is one (50:17 - 50:23)
they have something that they built very (50:21 - 50:25)
specifically (50:23 - 50:27)
for the raid and two (50:25 - 50:30)
they don't really care about the NPCs as (50:27 - 50:32)
much because the NPCs don't seem to (50:30 - 50:34)
affect the countdown timer they just (50:32 - 50:36)
aren't they don't yeah any additional (50:34 - 50:38)
time response they die in the damage so (50:36 - 50:40)
they people that I know who do a lot of (50:38 - 50:42)
solo content (50:40 - 50:46)
are building one very specific like (50:42 - 50:48)
special attacker or physical attacker (50:46 - 50:50)
for that they do the one cheer and then (50:48 - 50:53)
they just plow through (50:50 - 50:57)
and let the NPCs figure out and again (50:53 - 51:00)
the NPCs are somewhat random so you'll (50:57 - 51:01)
either get a great group and it will (51:00 - 51:04)
you'll sail through or you'll get the (51:01 - 51:07)
weird mix of like how how did any of (51:04 - 51:09)
this get chosen (51:07 - 51:12)
um so I think the end like it is easier (51:09 - 51:14)
if you're with people although (51:12 - 51:18)
with other people you really need to be (51:14 - 51:20)
coordinated right like (51:18 - 51:22)
I've found it's easier to do it with (51:20 - 51:24)
people in a room than it is to do it (51:22 - 51:26)
with randoms because if you can't (51:24 - 51:30)
communicate you can't often you can't (51:26 - 51:33)
see what they did anyways (51:30 - 51:36)
um or you know they'll they'll have done (51:33 - 51:38)
something and then suddenly they're just (51:36 - 51:42)
gone right like the Pokemon has gone and (51:38 - 51:44)
the menu hasn't updated and it you don't (51:42 - 51:46)
have any communication with each other (51:44 - 51:47)
and there's nothing in the game to say (51:46 - 51:49)
what happened (51:47 - 51:51)
um so (51:49 - 51:54)
it's tough in the fact that unless (51:51 - 51:56)
you're in a room or you're in a (51:54 - 51:57)
situation where one person can (51:56 - 52:00)
communicate to everybody working with (51:57 - 52:01)
other people can be incredibly difficult (52:00 - 52:04)
I do I do like that entire Charizard (52:01 - 52:06)
weekend I was just jumping into random (52:04 - 52:08)
raids and (52:06 - 52:11)
it was hit or miss whether we did it or (52:08 - 52:13)
not right like (52:11 - 52:15)
communication is (52:13 - 52:17)
vital if you have everybody because (52:15 - 52:19)
everybody's death takes away from the (52:17 - 52:21)
counter where that doesn't happen in (52:19 - 52:23)
Solo (52:21 - 52:25)
um so like it the the raid thing right (52:23 - 52:29)
now is super weird and your experiences (52:25 - 52:30)
are going to be all over the port (52:29 - 52:32)
depending on how you want to approach (52:30 - 52:33)
the game (52:32 - 52:34)
and then if you prepare for the Seven (52:33 - 52:36)
Star raids and you're hopping into Delhi (52:34 - 52:38)
bird raids and things like that the (52:36 - 52:40)
dolly bird raids are a breeze with (52:38 - 52:43)
anyone crazy yeah they're very easy yeah (52:40 - 52:45)
like uh when I went to solo Charizard on (52:43 - 52:47)
Monday because I could I couldn't do it (52:45 - 52:48)
with people right like the second you (52:47 - 52:50)
connect to the internet it could go away (52:48 - 52:52)
um I was like oh I'll just bring grip (52:50 - 52:53)
smart because that's what I was using (52:52 - 52:56)
for Charizard anyways and the like I I (52:53 - 52:59)
Charizard couldn't kill me uh he (52:56 - 53:00)
couldn't knock me out because I was so (52:59 - 53:02)
bulky but at the same time I was like oh (53:00 - 53:05)
I'm not doing enough damage and like (53:02 - 53:07)
it's not even like me dying taking away (53:05 - 53:08)
from the timer it's just like I cannot (53:07 - 53:11)
do enough damage fast enough to knock (53:08 - 53:13)
out Charizard so the second time I did (53:11 - 53:14)
it all I did was change one of my moves (53:13 - 53:17)
to bulk up and I just bulked up twice (53:14 - 53:19)
and I was like oh now I'm doing I'm (53:17 - 53:21)
doing enough damage perfect yeah it (53:19 - 53:23)
seems the best (53:21 - 53:25)
from what I can tell if you're gonna do (53:23 - 53:28)
solo content it is best that you're the (53:25 - 53:31)
main attacker because you cannot rely on (53:28 - 53:33)
the you can rely on the NPCs to heal you (53:31 - 53:36)
you can sometimes rely on the NPCs to (53:33 - 53:39)
buff you up but you cannot rely on the (53:36 - 53:41)
NPCs to do damage (53:39 - 53:43)
yeah I think I think anyone who's doing (53:41 - 53:46)
it solo needs to rely on sword stance or (53:43 - 53:48)
fake tears or Screech (53:46 - 53:49)
um or any of that usually preferably (53:48 - 53:51)
something that bucks you up because you (53:49 - 53:54)
can't Screech or fake tears if their (53:51 - 53:56)
Shield is up there there's ways to get (53:54 - 53:57)
around that (53:56 - 54:00)
um but you like a Swords Dance or a call (53:57 - 54:04)
mind or a bulk up uh to bulk you up is (54:00 - 54:07)
is is very helpful for for solo content (54:04 - 54:10)
uh the last point is to piggyback off (54:07 - 54:11)
what Greg said because I think Greg made (54:10 - 54:13)
an excellent point is is it's really (54:11 - 54:15)
hard to play with randoms (54:13 - 54:17)
um and I think (54:15 - 54:20)
if you are a more skilled player and (54:17 - 54:22)
you're playing with randoms you kind of (54:20 - 54:24)
have to make choices that benefit the (54:22 - 54:26)
entire team so if you see like two (54:24 - 54:28)
people are picking a Zoomer role and one (54:26 - 54:30)
person's picking a Charizard (54:28 - 54:32)
you can you have to look at that as a (54:30 - 54:34)
player and be like none of these are (54:32 - 54:37)
support so I need to play support uh (54:34 - 54:39)
it's almost like an OverWatch or uh or (54:37 - 54:42)
even a Pokemon unite where (54:39 - 54:45)
it's not going to work if we're all the (54:42 - 54:48)
same class if we pick five speedsters I (54:45 - 54:49)
don't think that's a good team (54:48 - 54:52)
composition I think also if you're going (54:49 - 54:54)
to do with randoms you kind of have to (54:52 - 54:57)
choose your Pokemon based off of like (54:54 - 55:00)
just consider them NPCs you can't well (54:57 - 55:02)
you're not gonna be able to tell what (55:00 - 55:04)
what they're gonna do without argue that (55:02 - 55:06)
maybe they're worse than NPCs NPCs don't (55:04 - 55:08)
have a penalty when they die yeah they (55:06 - 55:09)
take away from the time they take away (55:08 - 55:11)
from the timer so like if you're looking (55:09 - 55:14)
at what they're doing on the screen at (55:11 - 55:16)
least you get a bit of a hint of what (55:14 - 55:18)
the NPCs are gonna do before you go in (55:16 - 55:20)
and make adjustments accordingly (55:18 - 55:22)
but I think I think the problem even if (55:20 - 55:24)
you're doing everything right like let's (55:22 - 55:25)
again going back to the example you see (55:24 - 55:27)
two azum rolls you see a Charizard you'd (55:25 - 55:29)
end up picking blissy you're like I'll (55:27 - 55:31)
I'll play support here right a zoom roll (55:29 - 55:33)
can do enough damage Charizard it's kind (55:31 - 55:35)
of like that middle Charizard's like not (55:33 - 55:37)
major damage but also pretty bulky (55:35 - 55:40)
um can be bulky (55:37 - 55:42)
you still don't know what level they're (55:40 - 55:45)
at you still don't like you you don't (55:42 - 55:48)
know if they know the move set (55:45 - 55:50)
um like there's just so many variables (55:48 - 55:53)
that really make the random experience (55:50 - 55:55)
not (55:53 - 55:57)
great (55:55 - 55:59)
that goes to all games right like you (55:57 - 56:01)
you know you you hear it all the time (55:59 - 56:03)
with Pokemon unite like oh I I just want (56:01 - 56:04)
to play with the team because there's no (56:03 - 56:08)
communication uh so I (56:04 - 56:10)
while I while I said like playing with (56:08 - 56:12)
randoms is not great I don't think that (56:10 - 56:15)
discredits how much fun at least I'm (56:12 - 56:16)
having personally with the raid system (56:15 - 56:19)
like like it really is (56:16 - 56:23)
a fantastic experience at least for me (56:19 - 56:26)
uh because it does scratch that same (56:23 - 56:29)
itch that Destiny has scratched of like (56:26 - 56:31)
this is (56:29 - 56:35)
content that I find relatively easy but (56:31 - 56:37)
the challenge for me is to help other (56:35 - 56:39)
people get through it where their (56:37 - 56:40)
challenge might be just I'm bad at (56:39 - 56:42)
Pokemon I don't know anything about EVS (56:40 - 56:45)
like I've never built a team (56:42 - 56:47)
um like it was it was genuinely exciting (56:45 - 56:51)
for me to do that armor Rouge raid and (56:47 - 56:52)
help people get that armor Rouge because (56:51 - 56:54)
that armor which was specifically really (56:52 - 56:56)
good for cinderes coming up and then (56:54 - 56:58)
like I was like this is perfect and then (56:56 - 56:59)
I built that armor Rouge in front of (56:58 - 57:01)
people and it was like really great for (56:59 - 57:02)
people to be like hey can I can I see (57:01 - 57:04)
your stats one more time look what moves (57:02 - 57:05)
did you have like where do I get that (57:04 - 57:07)
held item and like have like a bunch of (57:05 - 57:09)
people like copy that and be like oh my (57:07 - 57:11)
gosh I'm so excited like I have this (57:09 - 57:13)
Pokemon for next week and like like that (57:11 - 57:15)
felt so good (57:13 - 57:18)
to be like oh idea hopefully armor Rouge (57:15 - 57:19)
is very good for now I think it will be (57:18 - 57:20)
here (57:19 - 57:24)
we are we are we are hopefully guessing (57:20 - 57:26)
correctly because we don't really know (57:24 - 57:28)
what's gonna happen I think it's (57:26 - 57:31)
interesting that like I do almost (57:28 - 57:34)
entirely random raid battles like I will (57:31 - 57:36)
just spend nights jumping into random (57:34 - 57:41)
raids and it's really interesting to see (57:36 - 57:41)
just the VA like you just have to (57:41 - 57:46)
approach it like it's a 50 50 shot if (57:44 - 57:48)
you're gonna get it (57:46 - 57:50)
can I ask Greg what's what's your (57:48 - 57:51)
experience with the Final Fantasy raids (57:50 - 57:52)
because Final Fantasy rates very similar (57:51 - 57:55)
to Destiny raids to me as like this (57:52 - 57:56)
harder content (57:55 - 57:58)
probably easy for you Greg I'm assuming (57:56 - 58:01)
because you've ran it 40 times you've (57:58 - 58:02)
ran it probably every week for five (58:01 - 58:05)
years right like (58:02 - 58:07)
do you get do you is there a point where (58:05 - 58:09)
I got I'm not sure what question am I (58:07 - 58:11)
asking but like for you like I'm very (58:09 - 58:13)
confident for you Final Fantasy raids (58:11 - 58:15)
you can do it with your eyes closed yeah (58:13 - 58:17)
but (58:15 - 58:19)
probably plenty of people joining those (58:17 - 58:21)
raids very first time they're doing it (58:19 - 58:24)
well I mean again it depends like (58:21 - 58:26)
nobody's good the first (58:24 - 58:30)
day or the first week right like Final (58:26 - 58:34)
Fantasy 14 raids are also like your gear (58:30 - 58:36)
like most of them aren't gear locked (58:34 - 58:38)
they don't set your stats so of course (58:36 - 58:39)
the longer they're out the better (58:38 - 58:41)
equipped everybody is and you just (58:39 - 58:42)
steamroll them (58:41 - 58:45)
um but yeah if you so Final Fantasy (58:42 - 58:47)
raids generally the first (58:45 - 58:50)
two or three weeks they're out are (58:47 - 58:54)
absolute chaos of they've introduced new (58:50 - 58:55)
mechanics there's a lot that you have to (58:54 - 58:57)
pay attention to there's they've never (58:55 - 59:01)
done this thing with this boss before (58:57 - 59:05)
um and so the good thing about the raid (59:01 - 59:09)
system in MMOs is they specifically (59:05 - 59:13)
except only x amount of roles right like (59:09 - 59:14)
if you're going to do an eight-man raid (59:13 - 59:16)
is two tanks two healers and the rest (59:14 - 59:19)
are DPS and that is forced On You by the (59:16 - 59:21)
game (59:19 - 59:24)
um and you can't alter that you have to (59:21 - 59:26)
you you have to do those things and yeah (59:24 - 59:29)
a bad tank and a bad healer can (59:26 - 59:33)
absolutely take down (59:29 - 59:34)
a raid (59:33 - 59:38)
um but generally (59:34 - 59:40)
it's you're only suffering for the first (59:38 - 59:44)
week and then everybody's everybody's on (59:40 - 59:47)
board and then eventually all the (59:44 - 59:49)
hardcore people get the gear that makes (59:47 - 59:52)
those things a breeze (59:49 - 59:54)
um and it it can be frustrating when you (59:52 - 59:56)
get a new person but the good thing (59:54 - 59:58)
about Final Fantasy 14 is they can type (59:56 - 60:02)
in the chat and communicate hey I'm new (59:58 - 60:04)
and I do not know what I'm supposed to (60:02 - 60:05)
be doing (60:04 - 60:07)
and you can explain it right like this (60:05 - 60:11)
boss will do this watch out for this and (60:07 - 60:12)
I think the problem with these Pokemon (60:11 - 60:14)
raids is like you can't communicate even (60:12 - 60:17)
if you could communicate like (60:14 - 60:19)
let's say you could communicate before (60:17 - 60:21)
the haunch crow and be like okay so I (60:19 - 60:23)
type in like hey heads up haunch Crow (60:21 - 60:26)
doesn't have any Steel type attacks like (60:23 - 60:28)
still doesn't dictate whether or not (60:26 - 60:30)
they have a good enough Pokemon right (60:28 - 60:31)
right right (60:30 - 60:35)
um because like I I I I had to tell my (60:31 - 60:36)
twitch shot I was like look (60:35 - 60:38)
I know you guys want to do some of these (60:36 - 60:41)
raids it's okay if if if you're looking (60:38 - 60:43)
at your five Pokemon that you have built (60:41 - 60:45)
and you're gonna say like oh none of (60:43 - 60:47)
these are good then don't join it's okay (60:45 - 60:50)
like (60:47 - 60:50)
like it's just you're you are just (60:50 - 60:54)
hurting the entire team if you're (60:53 - 60:57)
bringing something that's going to die (60:54 - 60:58)
um (60:57 - 61:00)
and (60:58 - 61:03)
so I I think (61:00 - 61:05)
I think unlike a final fantasy or unlike (61:03 - 61:09)
a destiny where your your skills can (61:05 - 61:11)
kind of carry you (61:09 - 61:13)
like it doesn't matter how much (61:11 - 61:15)
knowledge you have with Pokemon if you (61:13 - 61:17)
bring (61:15 - 61:20)
that grass type Pokemon to a Talonflame (61:17 - 61:22)
raid I mean it's the ultimate problem of (61:20 - 61:24)
a turn-based system (61:22 - 61:27)
and and a very strict level based system (61:24 - 61:30)
right like they don't necessarily gate (61:27 - 61:32)
keep you from getting in there like MMOs (61:30 - 61:35)
do like if if you are too low level you (61:32 - 61:38)
are not gonna get a level 80 player in (61:35 - 61:41)
an 85 dungeon it's just they're just (61:38 - 61:43)
barred from yeah it's just shocking that (61:41 - 61:46)
like the the six star raids don't say (61:43 - 61:48)
like you must be level 80. right and (61:46 - 61:50)
it's weird that they don't (61:48 - 61:52)
I I mean I do agree like this there (61:50 - 61:53)
there are as many things they can learn (61:52 - 61:55)
to do (61:53 - 61:57)
um what one thing that would help is (61:55 - 62:00)
like a roll system but like there aren't (61:57 - 62:02)
roles in (62:00 - 62:05)
Pokemon so that's I mean Pokemon is just (62:02 - 62:07)
attack it's like everything in the game (62:05 - 62:09)
just teaches you attack just attack and (62:07 - 62:11)
you'll be fine and then when you get to (62:09 - 62:15)
raids it's like okay so maybe not but (62:11 - 62:17)
we're not ever gonna explain that to you (62:15 - 62:19)
yes we're just never gonna do an in-game (62:17 - 62:22)
explanation we're never gonna have an (62:19 - 62:24)
in-game tutorial and we're never gonna (62:22 - 62:27)
have an in-game actual system that will (62:24 - 62:30)
does the school talk about raids they do (62:27 - 62:31)
a little I've taken all the classes they (62:30 - 62:33)
talk about little but they don't talk (62:31 - 62:35)
about the hard ones which is six and (62:33 - 62:38)
seven because you discover them on your (62:35 - 62:40)
own so the skills you learn about raids (62:38 - 62:43)
in school which I will say the school is (62:40 - 62:45)
incredibly helpful (62:43 - 62:47)
don't Translate (62:45 - 62:50)
they just don't translate to the higher (62:47 - 62:52)
difficulties they don't teach enough (62:50 - 62:55)
about typing they don't tell you enough (62:52 - 62:57)
about Tara to begin with they have one (62:55 - 63:00)
screen about it and you can very easily (62:57 - 63:02)
Breeze past it a friend who didn't even (63:00 - 63:05)
see them explain Tara at all (63:02 - 63:07)
and had no idea what this was doing (63:05 - 63:10)
because they don't pay attention to the (63:07 - 63:12)
game content or the advertisements (63:10 - 63:15)
before getting the game so they had no (63:12 - 63:17)
idea what Tara was at all I would argue (63:15 - 63:18)
that (63:17 - 63:22)
18 Gym badges an elite four another (63:18 - 63:25)
eight gym leaders a Champion Cup should (63:22 - 63:28)
teach you about the typing part oh yeah (63:25 - 63:30)
I mean Pokemon does a good job about (63:28 - 63:32)
teaching like this game particularly (63:30 - 63:33)
just a good time about typing it does a (63:32 - 63:35)
good thing like you have an entire math (63:33 - 63:37)
class this is about super effective and (63:35 - 63:38)
not effective moves like they do all (63:37 - 63:41)
that work but (63:38 - 63:44)
the game literally does teach you in (63:41 - 63:48)
almost every PVE situation (63:44 - 63:51)
pure power overrides everything (63:48 - 63:53)
and then when you get to the higher (63:51 - 63:55)
rates they literally just tell you don't (63:53 - 63:58)
go there that's always right it's really (63:55 - 63:59)
what's really crazy to think about is if (63:58 - 64:01)
you think about competitive the thing (63:59 - 64:04)
that matters so much in competitive (64:01 - 64:06)
isn't pure power although it's very (64:04 - 64:08)
important it's speed and specifically (64:06 - 64:10)
speed control (64:08 - 64:12)
um that's why like things like Tailwind (64:10 - 64:16)
Thunder Wave uh uh trick room they're so (64:12 - 64:20)
vital to letting you win that match and (64:16 - 64:22)
I think it in raids it's not that at all (64:20 - 64:23)
right like speed is right so we're (64:22 - 64:26)
relevant yeah and I I don't know even if (64:23 - 64:29)
they if they fix the the leg if speed (64:26 - 64:31)
would even matter anymore then it (64:29 - 64:35)
already doesn't uh but the thing I that (64:31 - 64:39)
really matters in raids is is (64:35 - 64:40)
um (64:39 - 64:42)
gosh I don't even know how to word it (64:40 - 64:44)
it's like (64:42 - 64:46)
the like the Swords Dance and the the (64:44 - 64:49)
like acid spray and the like like (64:46 - 64:51)
somebody watching HP to hit healing like (64:49 - 64:54)
it is really static manipulation is (64:51 - 64:56)
incredibly important raids and they (64:54 - 64:59)
don't talk about it at all (64:56 - 65:01)
much really like they don't really talk (64:59 - 65:03)
about what I had kind of hoped is after (65:01 - 65:06)
you had done all the school stuff and (65:03 - 65:09)
jock was like oh stay away from six raid (65:06 - 65:12)
that they had like an in-school (65:09 - 65:15)
simulator that would like walk through (65:12 - 65:17)
the raids and they just don't they're (65:15 - 65:20)
just like go have fun (65:17 - 65:22)
yeah I mean like (65:20 - 65:25)
it's it's also just (65:22 - 65:27)
just not understanding the mechanics of (65:25 - 65:29)
the game and I don't like I don't want (65:27 - 65:32)
to put that blame on the user right (65:29 - 65:33)
because like you know the very first (65:32 - 65:35)
time I played red and blue right you (65:33 - 65:36)
pick a squirrel you pick a Charmander (65:35 - 65:38)
you pick a Bulbasaur and your options (65:36 - 65:42)
are like scratch and growl yep and as a (65:38 - 65:43)
kid (65:42 - 65:46)
and you you hit the ground button and (65:43 - 65:47)
you're like well that didn't do any (65:46 - 65:49)
damage it lowered its attack I don't (65:47 - 65:51)
really know what that means right and so (65:49 - 65:52)
like (65:51 - 65:53)
that that's kind of like the running (65:52 - 65:57)
joke as as kids or even like adults that (65:53 - 65:58)
used to play Pokemon as kids is like (65:57 - 66:00)
does this move do damage no I'm not (65:58 - 66:05)
gonna teach it then right uh and (66:00 - 66:08)
now the moves that don't do damage are (66:05 - 66:11)
the most important moves and I was like (66:08 - 66:13)
trying to explain to somebody (66:11 - 66:16)
that like I was like oh well with with (66:13 - 66:19)
goldango or golden go (66:16 - 66:21)
you want to use Make It Rain it does 120 (66:19 - 66:24)
damage uh and you want a nasty plot and (66:21 - 66:25)
then you want to make it rain and then (66:24 - 66:27)
you want to make it rain and they were (66:25 - 66:28)
like why would I do that when I could (66:27 - 66:30)
just flash Cannon three times in a row (66:28 - 66:33)
and I was like well flash Cannon's only (66:30 - 66:38)
doing 80 80 plus 80 is 160 160 plus 80 (66:33 - 66:40)
is 240. so in three turns you're doing (66:38 - 66:43)
240 damage (66:40 - 66:43)
so two turns of Make It Rain is 240 (66:44 - 66:47)
damage (66:46 - 66:50)
and then if you nasty plot it's just (66:47 - 66:52)
like that nasty plot changes that math (66:50 - 66:55)
so it's it's so much higher like yeah (66:52 - 66:57)
like the quick math on nasty plot plus (66:55 - 67:00)
two make it rains is 200 is 420 damage (66:57 - 67:03)
compared to what did I say 2440 yeah (67:00 - 67:05)
like like there's a huge difference (67:03 - 67:08)
there yeah in three turns yeah um and (67:05 - 67:09)
that's what I think these status type (67:08 - 67:12)
moves are are are helping and nowhere (67:09 - 67:13)
again nowhere in the game doesn't tell (67:12 - 67:15)
you that I mean the thing is is they (67:13 - 67:18)
they you have to extrapolate it from the (67:15 - 67:19)
classes which most people don't even (67:18 - 67:21)
know that they should take the classes (67:19 - 67:22)
in (67:21 - 67:25)
thick school at all they're so good and (67:22 - 67:27)
complete the two semesters of classes (67:25 - 67:29)
you have to take at the school this is (67:27 - 67:31)
all from the math class and the math (67:29 - 67:33)
class is actually really good yeah this (67:31 - 67:35)
is I mean like I said before I am coming (67:33 - 67:37)
to this I am just starting to try to get (67:35 - 67:41)
into more competitive more uh Tech (67:37 - 67:44)
Titian like Pokemon now (67:41 - 67:45)
um I am thinking more about my Pokemon (67:44 - 67:48)
now and the math class had those basics (67:45 - 67:51)
down but you don't have to take the (67:48 - 67:53)
classes and you don't have to well you (67:51 - 67:54)
kind of have to pay attention to them (67:53 - 67:59)
but not entirely not a lot I do think (67:54 - 68:01)
about Final Fantasy 14 raids I did a ton (67:59 - 68:03)
when I played and I do think about like (68:01 - 68:05)
Destiny raids like the first time I did (68:03 - 68:07)
Vault of Glass it was I had no clue what (68:05 - 68:09)
I was doing I didn't I didn't know what (68:07 - 68:11)
I was getting in for for raid I didn't (68:09 - 68:12)
like the first time I did Vault of Glass (68:11 - 68:14)
I sat there for six hours with five (68:12 - 68:16)
people on voice comms that I have never (68:14 - 68:19)
met before uh like I went to I went to (68:16 - 68:21)
Reddit they were like we're doing Vault (68:19 - 68:23)
of Glass I was like cool I want to do (68:21 - 68:26)
this they were explaining how to do it (68:23 - 68:28)
as I was going I didn't think I had like (68:26 - 68:31)
the right gear or the right guns and (68:28 - 68:33)
eventually we did it and funny enough (68:31 - 68:35)
that raid was incredibly buggy at the (68:33 - 68:37)
end and it was like well we failed this (68:35 - 68:39)
because it just glitched out (68:37 - 68:41)
um and you know in newer Destiny rights (68:39 - 68:43)
they do the same thing right like people (68:41 - 68:44)
try to figure it out like there's a (68:43 - 68:46)
whole thing in the destiny Community is (68:44 - 68:48)
like who can figure out this rate and (68:46 - 68:49)
beat it the fastest and then like (68:48 - 68:51)
actually Bungie gives you like a WWE (68:49 - 68:53)
like belt like they mail it to you (68:51 - 68:54)
because you were like the first team to (68:53 - 68:57)
like figure it out so there there is fun (68:54 - 68:58)
there like I'm not saying like that's (68:57 - 69:00)
not the worst thing in the world like (68:58 - 69:01)
there is fun to people trying to figure (69:00 - 69:03)
out the the thing (69:01 - 69:05)
um (69:03 - 69:07)
it just brings me back to the article (69:05 - 69:08)
and reading this and it's like oh this (69:07 - 69:11)
well this article isn't yeah I mean it's (69:08 - 69:13)
interesting because Final Fantasy 14 (69:11 - 69:16)
solved that problem by creating the (69:13 - 69:17)
trust system (69:16 - 69:21)
and you can go in with competent players (69:17 - 69:25)
which is the NPCs and learn the (69:21 - 69:27)
mechanics of all the fights before you (69:25 - 69:29)
have to do it with anybody else and the (69:27 - 69:33)
NPCs while (69:29 - 69:34)
one incredible thing they did is (69:33 - 69:37)
depending on who you bring they all (69:34 - 69:39)
behave slightly different according to (69:37 - 69:40)
their personality so they will do (69:39 - 69:43)
certain moves in certain orders that are (69:40 - 69:46)
story driven which is really cool but (69:43 - 69:50)
they will do they will do the mechanic (69:46 - 69:53)
and call out the mechanic like in (69:50 - 69:55)
there's things called stack markers in (69:53 - 69:57)
the Final Fantasy 14 and when they (69:55 - 70:00)
appear all the NPCs are run together and (69:57 - 70:02)
somebody will shout gather and so you (70:00 - 70:05)
you can learn in a stress-free (70:02 - 70:06)
environment where you're not with other (70:05 - 70:09)
people what these mechanics are supposed (70:06 - 70:12)
to be and I honestly think like it's one (70:09 - 70:13)
of the best things they've ever done (70:12 - 70:18)
because people can now come prepared and (70:13 - 70:19)
be like (70:18 - 70:23)
I've done it with NPCs it took a long (70:19 - 70:26)
time because NPCs aren't optimized but I (70:23 - 70:28)
now understand what I'm supposed to do (70:26 - 70:30)
and like I can actually do this (70:28 - 70:32)
confidently and I wish there was (70:30 - 70:35)
something like that in this game (70:32 - 70:35)
Final Fantasy does love to stack (70:35 - 70:40)
characters on top of each other too you (70:38 - 70:42)
have no idea how crazy the sack markers (70:40 - 70:45)
have gotten there are now tank specifics (70:42 - 70:47)
Tech markers and you have to pay (70:45 - 70:50)
attention to the dots above because if (70:47 - 70:51)
it's a big raid where there's three (70:50 - 70:52)
tanks you have to pay attention if it's (70:51 - 70:54)
two dots or three dots because that's (70:52 - 70:56)
how many tanks have to be there (70:54 - 70:58)
look things have gotten complicated in (70:56 - 71:00)
that world I just that was that was one (70:58 - 71:02)
of the most common mechanics they (71:00 - 71:04)
defaulted on in Final Fantasy 14 was (71:02 - 71:06)
everyone stand up on top of each other (71:04 - 71:07)
yeah and now they have everybody stand (71:06 - 71:09)
up on top of each other but these three (71:07 - 71:12)
people have to run away (71:09 - 71:12)
attacking uh Niantic likes to stack on (71:16 - 71:20)
all the EVS (71:18 - 71:23)
we got a new winter (71:20 - 71:26)
is this this is part two this is the (71:23 - 71:28)
this is holiday part two holiday part (71:26 - 71:31)
Electric Boogaloo (71:28 - 71:34)
um it kicked off today as we're (71:31 - 71:36)
recording this it will run for a full (71:34 - 71:39)
week uh there this is a brand new hat (71:36 - 71:42)
for Evie right yeah I think so I don't (71:39 - 71:44)
recognize the Hat (71:42 - 71:49)
uh so Evie will make its holiday uh (71:44 - 71:53)
holiday hat debut I guess uh but also it (71:49 - 71:54)
can evolve (71:53 - 71:56)
so it has all the Eevee evolutions here (71:54 - 71:58)
although I'm pretty sure you're not (71:56 - 71:59)
finding those in the wild I think it (71:58 - 72:01)
just if you've all the Eevee you can get (71:59 - 72:06)
I it doesn't seem very clear that you (72:01 - 72:08)
can't find them in the wild I'm assuming (72:06 - 72:10)
when I scroll down to Wild encounters (72:08 - 72:12)
it's just Evie (72:10 - 72:16)
either no they are only available by (72:12 - 72:18)
evolving Evie wearing the hat is what (72:16 - 72:21)
I'm seeing unless you want Glaceon in an (72:18 - 72:25)
undersea holiday outfit yeah (72:21 - 72:25)
uh which that isn't right but not in the (72:26 - 72:32)
wild no you can only pay money for (72:29 - 72:35)
undersea holiday Glaceon (72:32 - 72:38)
it can be shiny though (72:35 - 72:41)
so Evie with a hat could be shiny uh the (72:38 - 72:43)
first time ever trainers will be able to (72:41 - 72:45)
evolve their Cub chew wearing a holiday (72:43 - 72:48)
ribbon into bear tick wearing a holiday (72:45 - 72:50)
ribbon which that cup chew could be (72:48 - 72:53)
shiny so the bear tick could be shiny I (72:50 - 72:54)
got a shiny one of those last year I'm (72:53 - 72:56)
excited to be able to evolve it this (72:54 - 72:59)
year why do they wait I don't understand (72:56 - 73:02)
I I think initially (72:59 - 73:03)
I don't know I don't have any inside (73:02 - 73:06)
information this is just an opinion uh I (73:03 - 73:08)
think initially (73:06 - 73:10)
they were against evolving it (73:08 - 73:14)
uh because that would be too (73:10 - 73:17)
well initially they did have them evolve (73:14 - 73:19)
because initially it was the Pikachu yes (73:17 - 73:21)
kitchen right you all had the hats at (73:19 - 73:22)
the beginning (73:21 - 73:23)
um (73:22 - 73:26)
and then they stopped and then the EVS (73:23 - 73:28)
came (73:26 - 73:30)
and then they started doing Pokemon that (73:28 - 73:32)
weren't EVs and weren't Pikachus and (73:30 - 73:35)
then they didn't want those to evolve (73:32 - 73:37)
and now they're like maybe we can evolve (73:35 - 73:38)
I don't know I I would assume they were (73:37 - 73:40)
like listening to people being like Oh (73:38 - 73:43)
I'm sick of these hats yeah I think they (73:40 - 73:44)
were listening to people saying that oh (73:43 - 73:46)
I got a hundred percent of this Pokemon (73:44 - 73:49)
and I can't use it anyway yes yeah that (73:46 - 73:51)
too I think that was the feedback I (73:49 - 73:53)
don't uh so I should clarify I don't (73:51 - 73:54)
know why they initially didn't want them (73:53 - 73:56)
to evolve but I think they're evolving (73:54 - 73:59)
now based on feedback of well I got a (73:56 - 74:00)
hundred percent ribbon (73:59 - 74:03)
Cub chew and I can't do anything with (74:00 - 74:05)
this cup I could do I think the big (74:03 - 74:07)
thing was like Togepi wasn't it it was (74:05 - 74:09)
like yeah it was the big one I think I (74:07 - 74:11)
got this bike perfect Togepi or this (74:09 - 74:13)
would be like amazing for Ultra cup but (74:11 - 74:16)
I literally cannot evolve it (74:13 - 74:19)
um so I'm gonna assume that niantic's (74:16 - 74:21)
listening there now that they're letting (74:19 - 74:24)
Pokemon evolve this is not the (74:21 - 74:26)
Fair they did something last week that (74:24 - 74:28)
could evolve for the first time wasn't (74:26 - 74:30)
it something with a hat or something (74:28 - 74:32)
yeah that sounds familiar (74:30 - 74:35)
oh well the we'll get to the hoot hoot (74:32 - 74:37)
you can start up to 40 gifts for this (74:35 - 74:39)
event (74:37 - 74:42)
uh you can uh Winter Wonderland so uh (74:39 - 74:45)
for Christmas Eve and Christmas day you (74:42 - 74:47)
get one extra special trade that's (74:45 - 74:48)
probably that's pretty good because if (74:47 - 74:50)
you're saying family you can only do one (74:48 - 74:52)
trade you know you want to trade with (74:50 - 74:53)
Grandma but you know grandpa needs your (74:52 - 74:55)
sailor you can do both (74:53 - 74:59)
uh uh lucky (74:55 - 75:01)
I I don't know if I understand this (74:59 - 75:03)
fully the number of guaranteed lucky (75:01 - 75:06)
Pokemon a trainer can receive in trade (75:03 - 75:09)
has been increased from 10 to 15. yeah (75:06 - 75:11)
starting on set the Hannah's gonna have (75:09 - 75:13)
to explain this starting Saturday the (75:11 - 75:16)
24th at 10 A.M if you trade a Pokemon (75:13 - 75:17)
that's spent (75:16 - 75:19)
uh that has spent time in a trainer (75:17 - 75:22)
store since 2017 it is going to be (75:19 - 75:24)
guaranteed to be lucky until that limit (75:22 - 75:26)
is reached this change is permanent (75:24 - 75:28)
going forward (75:26 - 75:31)
yes so this has been kind of hidden for (75:28 - 75:34)
a long time that every single person had (75:31 - 75:36)
10 guaranteed lucky traits that if you (75:34 - 75:38)
traded a Pokemon that was old enough (75:36 - 75:40)
that trade would guaranteed be a lucky (75:38 - 75:43)
trade and you could get 10 of those and (75:40 - 75:45)
once you did those 10 you it wouldn't be (75:43 - 75:47)
guaranteed anymore so now they're just (75:45 - 75:51)
upping that to 50. is that a day (75:47 - 75:54)
no that's just engine no just total (75:51 - 75:56)
oh (75:54 - 75:59)
so (75:56 - 75:59)
so it's a small I messed this up I I was (76:00 - 76:07)
with Greg in Boston (76:04 - 76:11)
right and then uh Greg was like out (76:07 - 76:13)
doing something because Greg was living (76:11 - 76:14)
the wildlife he was never having Hotel (76:13 - 76:17)
Boston I'm in a new city why would I sit (76:14 - 76:18)
in the hotel (76:17 - 76:21)
it was 11 o'clock Greg I was tired I was (76:18 - 76:23)
ready to go to bed there's a lot to (76:21 - 76:25)
happen there's a lot that happens when (76:23 - 76:28)
the sun go down baby I'm the old man in (76:25 - 76:30)
the relationship with me and Greg yeah (76:28 - 76:31)
you absolutely are Eric's the young (76:30 - 76:34)
vibrant one Craig was out every single (76:31 - 76:36)
night I was in bed at like 10 o'clock (76:34 - 76:38)
every night look this pattern repeated (76:36 - 76:40)
itself in Philadelphia because I was (76:38 - 76:43)
also up to 2 A.M every night uh so I (76:40 - 76:44)
messed this up I didn't understand this (76:43 - 76:46)
uh so (76:44 - 76:49)
uh my my friend Brooke she didn't have (76:46 - 76:51)
any lucky Pokemon and she had a Shiny (76:49 - 76:53)
Snorlax and I was like oh this is great (76:51 - 76:56)
because it's 11 o'clock so I'll trade (76:53 - 76:59)
you a Pokemon from 2017 and then I'll (76:56 - 77:02)
get the lucky Shiny Snorlax and then you (76:59 - 77:04)
can ask whatever shiny you want from me (77:02 - 77:06)
and then you trade me a Pokemon from (77:04 - 77:09)
2017 and then you you get the whatever (77:06 - 77:11)
shiny lucky because that's great because (77:09 - 77:12)
you have to wait till midnight further (77:11 - 77:14)
your lucky thing to reset but I already (77:12 - 77:18)
did my 10 from 2017. so even though my (77:14 - 77:20)
Pokemon was from 2017 (77:18 - 77:24)
it was it should have yeah I thought so (77:20 - 77:26)
too but when I got the Snorlax it didn't (77:24 - 77:28)
end up being lucky huh (77:26 - 77:31)
but when she traded me her 2017. (77:28 - 77:33)
because her star likes was new her life (77:31 - 77:35)
I think it might have only been up to (77:33 - 77:37)
2016 until this change (77:35 - 77:39)
oh you think so I think so if I'm (77:37 - 77:42)
getting back to the (77:39 - 77:44)
page right now (77:42 - 77:47)
no I'm on the wrong page (77:44 - 77:49)
I'm pretty sure that it was only 2016 (77:47 - 77:52)
Pokemon that were the guaranteed ones I (77:49 - 77:54)
feel like I made it into 2016. I felt (77:52 - 77:56)
like I know for sure I've done my 10. (77:54 - 78:00)
but I thought that like as long as one (77:56 - 78:02)
of those two Pokemon were old enough (78:00 - 78:04)
that it would be guaranteed (78:02 - 78:07)
I think it should be I also could be (78:04 - 78:09)
explaining it wrong it's not a mechanic (78:07 - 78:11)
that I have looked into in depth because (78:09 - 78:14)
it's so limited yeah it's this is what (78:11 - 78:17)
look at the way it reads here is they (78:14 - 78:19)
are officially stating 2017 for the (78:17 - 78:21)
first time so I I think the belief was (78:19 - 78:24)
that it was a rolling (78:21 - 78:26)
thing like well because like it was (78:24 - 78:29)
eight years ago it overlaps with the (78:26 - 78:30)
mechanic of as long as it was I believe (78:29 - 78:33)
three or more years ago then you have a (78:30 - 78:36)
higher chance of it becoming lucky but (78:33 - 78:37)
that's different from the guaranteed (78:36 - 78:38)
lucky (78:37 - 78:42)
yes correct yes because I think if it (78:38 - 78:44)
was yeah but it says if you trade a (78:42 - 78:46)
Pokemon that has spent time in your (78:44 - 78:47)
storage it is guaranteed to be lucky (78:46 - 78:50)
until the limit is reached so because I (78:47 - 78:52)
hit my limit of 10 I traded the old one (78:50 - 78:55)
yeah and it didn't work and it didn't (78:52 - 78:58)
work but now now (78:55 - 79:00)
so everyone up to this point would have (78:58 - 79:03)
done the 10. so now what they're saying (79:00 - 79:05)
this is this is the takeaway you have (79:03 - 79:09)
five more Pokemon that would be (79:05 - 79:12)
guaranteed so what I would recommend is (79:09 - 79:15)
like I would take my five Pokemon from (79:12 - 79:18)
2017 and I would trade them to like Greg (79:15 - 79:21)
for like legendaries so then those (79:18 - 79:23)
legendaries would end up being lucky and (79:21 - 79:26)
then Greg would be able to take his five (79:23 - 79:29)
from 2017 and ask for my legendaries but (79:26 - 79:30)
we would have to do that on separate (79:29 - 79:32)
days right because that would be one (79:30 - 79:34)
lucky trade right but I would be giving (79:32 - 79:36)
this as advice until you're sure right (79:34 - 79:42)
ideally my 2017 shouldn't affect Greg's (79:36 - 79:45)
2017. like we should both get we (79:42 - 79:47)
should both get a separate instance of (79:45 - 79:50)
five yes (79:47 - 79:52)
and you would want to try to probably (79:50 - 79:55)
save those for like Legends because (79:52 - 79:58)
Legends are harder to power up (79:55 - 79:59)
and you would get good rolls (79:58 - 80:01)
which would encourage you to power them (79:59 - 80:02)
up (80:01 - 80:05)
yeah yeah but this is way more thought (80:02 - 80:08)
than I ever want to put into that so if (80:05 - 80:11)
you use screech in a Seven Star let's (80:08 - 80:13)

places from two to five p.m on Christmas (80:37 - 80:42)
Eve (80:39 - 80:45)
uh it has a super boosted shiny and it's (80:42 - 80:47)
shiny is actually pretty good it looks (80:45 - 80:48)
like it could be a fire type it's kind (80:47 - 80:51)
of wild yes (80:48 - 80:54)
uh I mean I I mean two to five at least (80:51 - 80:56)
isn't when most people have to get (80:54 - 80:58)
together with their family to do that's (80:56 - 80:59)
true (80:58 - 81:01)
it would be better if it was like two to (80:59 - 81:02)
five on Christmas Day when you really (81:01 - 81:04)
want to get away from people I have to (81:02 - 81:07)
go I have to go do this thing (81:04 - 81:09)
uh the New Year's Event is coming back (81:07 - 81:11)
uh (81:09 - 81:13)
uh that will debut a new Pikachu wearing (81:11 - 81:15)
a top hat although I don't think this (81:13 - 81:17)
Pikachu can evolve it doesn't yeah it (81:15 - 81:19)
does not say it so it cannot we gotta (81:17 - 81:21)
wait till next year to evolve the (81:19 - 81:25)
Pikachu why but the hoot hoot from last (81:21 - 81:28)
year can now evolve this year (81:25 - 81:33)
niantic's really milking content boy (81:28 - 81:33)
it's really small (81:38 - 81:42)
the hoot hoot with the top hat was (81:40 - 81:44)
probably one of the best costumes (81:42 - 81:46)
they've ever done it's good (81:44 - 81:48)
definitely (81:46 - 81:49)
um (81:48 - 81:52)
ah so (81:49 - 81:54)
Pikachu wearing a party Top Hat hoot (81:52 - 81:56)
hoot wearing a New Year's Eve outfit (81:54 - 81:58)
that's what they're they say weren't (81:56 - 81:59)
both wearing a party hat are all (81:58 - 82:01)
appearing in the wild (81:59 - 82:04)

cleffa iggly buff Togepi Tyrogue (82:04 - 82:09)
Smoochum Ellicott Magby azumerel ezrael (82:06 - 82:13)
uh why not all appearing in 7K eggs this (82:09 - 82:14)
is (82:13 - 82:16)
they just did this to water down the (82:14 - 82:19)
Pichu like yeah people people want the (82:16 - 82:20)
Pichu and they just watered down this (82:19 - 82:22)
egg pool there's no reason why half (82:20 - 82:24)
these Pokemon need to be here they can (82:22 - 82:26)
all be shiny though (82:24 - 82:28)
we're getting we're getting to the point (82:26 - 82:30)
where most Pokemon can be shiny we're (82:28 - 82:32)
finally getting there (82:30 - 82:34)
one star raids will be Bulbasaur wearing (82:32 - 82:36)
a party hat Charmander wearing a party (82:34 - 82:38)
hat Squirtle wearing a party hat uh (82:36 - 82:39)
Pikachu wearing a party Top Hat that's (82:38 - 82:41)

that the Hat three star raids bringing (82:41 - 82:45)
back the raticade wearing a party hat (82:44 - 82:48)
Nidorino wearing a party hat Gengar you (82:45 - 82:50)
guessed it wearing a party hat and then (82:48 - 82:53)
Wobbuffet wearing a party hat (82:50 - 82:55)
um wasn't there like supposed to be a (82:53 - 82:57)
makeup day in like (82:55 - 83:00)
Australia Gengar thing that like never (82:57 - 83:02)
happened I don't think it ever yeah did (83:00 - 83:04)
it I mean so those initially came out at (83:02 - 83:06)
the very very beginning of kind of the (83:04 - 83:08)
global understanding of the pandemic (83:06 - 83:11)
yeah yeah back in March 2020 and I think (83:08 - 83:14)
that we decided that those also were (83:11 - 83:16)
released last year during the New Year's (83:14 - 83:18)
Event so they aren't as rare as they (83:16 - 83:20)
once were but they are still Pokemon (83:18 - 83:22)
that a whole bunch of people don't have (83:20 - 83:24)
because of when they were first released (83:22 - 83:26)
and niantics said they were going to do (83:24 - 83:28)
a makeup event I think they publicly (83:26 - 83:30)
said they were going to yeah they did (83:28 - 83:32)
and then I don't think they ever got (83:30 - 83:33)
that event (83:32 - 83:37)
at all wow it's super valuable if they (83:33 - 83:39)
did that I don't know who also had the (83:37 - 83:42)
clone Pokemon I'm pretty sure oh man I (83:39 - 83:43)
would love them to bring back the clone (83:42 - 83:45)
Pokemon I don't know if that was also (83:43 - 83:47)
Japan (83:45 - 83:49)
I felt like there were a couple regions (83:47 - 83:50)
that got it and then like somebody got a (83:49 - 83:52)
makeup event but some uh somebody else (83:50 - 83:53)
didn't (83:52 - 83:55)
but I don't remember (83:53 - 83:57)
I'd have to look uh Russia RAM is coming (83:55 - 83:58)
back (83:57 - 84:01)
uh and then Mega Steelix is coming back (83:58 - 84:03)
and there will be a New Year's (84:01 - 84:05)
collection challenge uh and it says (84:03 - 84:07)
specifically because Greg loves (84:05 - 84:10)
collection challenges Stardust (84:07 - 84:12)
uh on the plus side the event bonus will (84:10 - 84:16)
be half incubators (84:12 - 84:19)
also uh there's a new thing here uh you (84:16 - 84:22)
will get one fourth hatch distance for (84:19 - 84:25)
the first three hatched eggs during the (84:22 - 84:27)
event if you're using the egg hatching (84:25 - 84:31)
widget uh which is on both IOS and (84:27 - 84:32)
Android (84:31 - 84:35)
uh this is the second time they're doing (84:32 - 84:38)
this oh what was the first time I do not (84:35 - 84:40)
remember exactly because I only barely (84:38 - 84:42)
noticed that it was a thing I have the (84:40 - 84:45)
widget so it was I it was happening to (84:42 - 84:47)
the eggs that I was incubating but I had (84:45 - 84:49)
no idea why (84:47 - 84:51)
foreign (84:49 - 84:53)
it is just the first three if you have (84:51 - 84:56)
the widget on one of your phone screens (84:53 - 84:57)
it's not so you just have to have the (84:56 - 84:59)
widget and then the first three eggs you (84:57 - 85:01)
put in will have a one-fourth instead of (84:59 - 85:04)
one half I accidentally wasted mine on I (85:01 - 85:06)
think 2K eggs so (85:04 - 85:08)
got it okay got it don't do that so that (85:06 - 85:13)
that will go in effect on (85:08 - 85:19)
uh uh Saturday December 31st at 8 00 pm (85:13 - 85:23)
so don't put your 2K eggs in no after 8 (85:19 - 85:27)
P.M local time yes as you are (85:23 - 85:28)
celebrating New Year's make sure to pay (85:27 - 85:31)
attention and make sure you only get 10K (85:28 - 85:35)
and 12K eggs for the new year yeah (85:31 - 85:39)
pay attention to your egg Widget the egg (85:35 - 85:42)
which is the most important part (85:39 - 85:42)
at least they have a bonus going on this (85:42 - 85:48)
one actually kind of feels like an event (85:45 - 85:48)
yeah like I I think their New Year's (85:48 - 85:52)
Event is pretty good and I think the New (85:50 - 85:54)
Year's Event is always this is not (85:52 - 85:56)
niantic's fault but the New Year's Event (85:54 - 85:58)
is always less stressful because people (85:56 - 86:01)
care way more about the social stigma (85:58 - 86:04)
around Christmas than around New Year's (86:01 - 86:07)
yeah well New Year's really isn't a (86:04 - 86:10)
family event for a lot of people right (86:07 - 86:13)
beers is uh go out and party with your (86:10 - 86:15)
friends or plan to go out and party and (86:13 - 86:17)
then not actually make plans nobody ever (86:15 - 86:19)
don't actually go out and then complain (86:17 - 86:21)
that you didn't do anything for New (86:19 - 86:23)
Year's I don't know why I don't know why (86:21 - 86:25)
people complain about doing it it's a (86:23 - 86:27)
one second holiday and it's pretty bad (86:25 - 86:30)
that one second ain't great (86:27 - 86:30)
yeah yeah it's it's definitely a day oh (86:33 - 86:38)
that's for sure definitely I think that (86:37 - 86:41)
happens when we reset the air to a (86:38 - 86:42)
randomly new number (86:41 - 86:46)
uh Greg tell us about uh the last bit of (86:42 - 86:48)
news here an exciting update from the (86:46 - 86:50)
Pokemon unite team so unite is getting a (86:48 - 86:52)
new director and the new director is (86:50 - 86:54)
like transparency for all and we'd love (86:52 - 86:56)
to see it so the two big things there's (86:54 - 86:59)
another patch fine they are nerfing and (86:56 - 87:00)
buffing a bunch of stuff you're either (86:59 - 87:02)
angry or happy depending on who you play (87:00 - 87:05)
but the two things that came out the two (87:02 - 87:07)
things that came out and actually said (87:05 - 87:08)
was (87:07 - 87:12)
when we release zorark with the costume (87:08 - 87:15)
and you had to buy the bundle you all (87:12 - 87:17)
hated that and we're never gonna do that (87:15 - 87:20)
again okay so can I reword what they (87:17 - 87:22)
said yeah so what they actually said was (87:20 - 87:25)
we didn't sell enough zorark with the (87:22 - 87:27)
bundle so we're not going to do it again (87:25 - 87:31)
yeah a lot of people are taking this one (87:27 - 87:32)
paragraph to say they're never going to (87:31 - 87:34)
gem block Pokemon for the first week (87:32 - 87:37)
again that is not what this says they (87:34 - 87:39)
are absolutely going to gem lock for the (87:37 - 87:42)
first week they're just not going to tie (87:39 - 87:45)
it to a costume that is more expensive (87:42 - 87:47)
when you have to buy both but they're (87:45 - 87:50)
blocking is secretly okay yeah I don't (87:47 - 87:52)
care about the dim light because like (87:50 - 87:55)
then you don't have this (87:52 - 87:56)
the thing the thing that I've (87:55 - 87:59)
experienced in other games is when a new (87:56 - 88:01)
character gets released (87:59 - 88:03)
if somebody doesn't get to play the new (88:01 - 88:05)
character they will throw the match (88:03 - 88:08)
yeah so therefore gem locking it (88:05 - 88:11)
actually prevents that from happening (88:08 - 88:13)
yeah the gem black thing isn't a bad (88:11 - 88:14)
thing it's just a lot of people were (88:13 - 88:16)
assuming that that this was them saying (88:14 - 88:17)
they're never gonna gem block Pokemon (88:16 - 88:20)
again and that is wrong they're never (88:17 - 88:23)
gonna do the Pokemon plus costume bundle (88:20 - 88:24)
again (88:23 - 88:26)
uh which is fine because everybody hated (88:24 - 88:27)
it and nobody well not at launch I'm (88:26 - 88:29)
sure there will be Pokemon plus costume (88:27 - 88:31)
bundle right now they'll do bundles (88:29 - 88:33)
later but it's not going to be locked at (88:31 - 88:35)
the new characters they're gonna be like (88:33 - 88:37)
the other big thing they decided to do (88:35 - 88:41)
was tell the world hey here's how we do (88:37 - 88:43)
matchmaking guess what there's this (88:41 - 88:45)
there's a secret number that you can't (88:43 - 88:46)
see (88:45 - 88:49)
and so you are paired with people who (88:46 - 88:52)
have similar mmrs as you which is (88:49 - 88:54)
matchmaking ratings (88:52 - 88:56)
and they've been doing this thing for a (88:54 - 88:59)
while where when you're waiting for is (88:56 - 89:00)
this bad or good (88:59 - 89:04)
so it's interesting it's good to know (89:00 - 89:06)
what the game is telling you because (89:04 - 89:09)
before when you would go into like okay (89:06 - 89:11)
I'm gonna play a random match solo and (89:09 - 89:13)
it would say (89:11 - 89:16)
hey searching for players and then at (89:13 - 89:18)
some point about 30 seconds in it would (89:16 - 89:21)
say expanding match parameters and none (89:18 - 89:23)
of us knew what that meant (89:21 - 89:26)
so they finally took the time to explain (89:23 - 89:30)
what that meant so they have a hidden (89:26 - 89:33)
scar called an MMR which is decided and (89:30 - 89:36)
set by your win percentage how many (89:33 - 89:38)
consecutive wins you've had and what (89:36 - 89:41)
your current rank is and so what they (89:38 - 89:43)
try to do in their initial matchmaking (89:41 - 89:47)
is match you with people who are similar (89:43 - 89:49)
in your rating so but they want to try (89:47 - 89:52)
to get as close to 96 percent within (89:49 - 89:55)
that ballpark so they're trying to match (89:52 - 89:58)
you not only with other solo players or (89:55 - 90:00)
if you're in a Duo other Duos that match (89:58 - 90:03)
or if you're a three-person other three (90:00 - 90:04)
persons like they're trying to get you (90:03 - 90:06)
close (90:04 - 90:10)
if that fails and they don't find (90:06 - 90:13)
anybody it drops to 81 percent and then (90:10 - 90:16)
they're going to start looking at almost (90:13 - 90:19)
evenly matched which means (90:16 - 90:21)
they're going to really go out to people (90:19 - 90:23)
who have really really bad win rates or (90:21 - 90:25)
really really good weights and match you (90:23 - 90:28)
up or if that fails then they're gonna (90:25 - 90:30)
go with wildly (90:28 - 90:33)
wildly unmatched (90:30 - 90:35)
just whatever these people need to play (90:33 - 90:38)
and you need to get into a game so this (90:35 - 90:41)
finally helps answer what a lot of (90:38 - 90:43)
people have been doing the other thing (90:41 - 90:46)
that they said that everybody is excited (90:43 - 90:48)
for because we can't really change our (90:46 - 90:50)
MMR we're like we don't understand that (90:48 - 90:53)
we can't see it but we understand that (90:50 - 90:54)
you're trying to get us with similarly (90:53 - 90:57)
skilled people (90:54 - 90:59)
the other thing they did is they (90:57 - 91:02)
officially stated as of December 1st (90:59 - 91:06)
that they are making uh they're looking (91:02 - 91:08)
at making changes to the fair play (91:06 - 91:14)
points uh so if somebody stops playing (91:08 - 91:17)
during a match their Fair pay points are (91:14 - 91:20)
going to be reduced more heavily (91:17 - 91:23)
but they're also now going to add that (91:20 - 91:24)
to (91:23 - 91:27)
their MMR score so if a person just (91:24 - 91:28)
stops playing it's going to affect their (91:27 - 91:32)
MMR score but the big thing is is they (91:28 - 91:34)
are implementing over the next month or (91:32 - 91:35)
so they're not they haven't been too (91:34 - 91:37)
clear is (91:35 - 91:40)
the common ways people are avoiding (91:37 - 91:43)
being detected of the AFK which is (91:40 - 91:46)
standing on a often standing on a goal (91:43 - 91:48)
and just hitting the a button so the (91:46 - 91:50)
game registers you as doing something (91:48 - 91:53)
they're implementing A system that looks (91:50 - 91:57)
for those behaviors and dings you as not (91:53 - 91:59)
playing (91:57 - 92:01)
so there's a lot during yeah I think (91:59 - 92:02)
Greg can speak to this this happens a (92:01 - 92:03)
lot during (92:02 - 92:05)
um not like ranked matches but like (92:03 - 92:08)
events of like play like 10 games to (92:05 - 92:11)
unlock the the the points to buy the (92:08 - 92:13)
skin or whatever yeah so our people (92:11 - 92:14)
would just sit on base and not do (92:13 - 92:15)
anything because they're just trying to (92:14 - 92:18)
ride out the game so they are (92:15 - 92:22)
uh going to improve the accuracy of (92:18 - 92:25)
detecting passive play so that's (92:22 - 92:27)
avoiding using moves to avoid appearing (92:25 - 92:31)
inactive sitting on a base not in like (92:27 - 92:32)
running away from battles so like (92:31 - 92:34)
there's battles happening and you're a (92:32 - 92:36)
million miles away they're going to (92:34 - 92:39)
consider that passive play so this is a (92:36 - 92:42)
huge win as far as (92:39 - 92:46)
just how they're how they are one being (92:42 - 92:48)
transparent thank you for telling us (92:46 - 92:50)
what you're planning on doing but two (92:48 - 92:53)
it's really saying we understand that (92:50 - 92:55)
these are really negative impacting (92:53 - 92:57)
behaviors people have and we are now (92:55 - 92:59)
finally going to tell you we are taking (92:57 - 93:03)
action against those (92:59 - 93:06)
uh players (93:03 - 93:08)
um they're getting a new director a new (93:06 - 93:10)
producer who's coming in (93:08 - 93:12)
um which is very exciting because we'll (93:10 - 93:14)
be seeing it but the old producer (93:12 - 93:16)
decided to give everybody (93:14 - 93:18)
the giant middle finger on their way out (93:16 - 93:19)
with the current (93:18 - 93:23)
in-game bonus that is so atrocious it's (93:19 - 93:25)
like I cannot believe you did this do we (93:23 - 93:27)
think that the old producer was pushed (93:25 - 93:31)
out like I don't think so I think the (93:27 - 93:35)
old producer probably was like I (93:31 - 93:38)
I want to work on any things and I'm I'm (93:35 - 93:41)
I'm kind of done with this I I want to (93:38 - 93:43)
move on to other things and they found (93:41 - 93:44)
somebody who's like I have a lot of (93:43 - 93:45)
great new ideas and this is a passion (93:44 - 93:47)
project and they swapped them out (93:45 - 93:49)
generally in a lot of Corporations (93:47 - 93:51)
spoiler alert (93:49 - 93:54)
if you are in a large corporation (93:51 - 93:56)
vice presidents and presidents like to (93:54 - 93:58)
change every three years because it (93:56 - 94:00)
looks good to investors because they're (93:58 - 94:03)
trying something new so generally (94:00 - 94:04)
they're like I'm going to take a lateral (94:03 - 94:07)
move to do something else and I want (94:04 - 94:09)
somebody else to come in (94:07 - 94:10)
um however the old director decided to (94:09 - 94:13)
put in this scratch card system for the (94:10 - 94:16)
holidays which you can only earn scratch (94:13 - 94:19)
cards by buying the most expensive (94:16 - 94:23)
outfits for gems in the shop and to get (94:19 - 94:25)
all the scratch cards somebody did the (94:23 - 94:28)
math it's like a thousand dollars well (94:25 - 94:29)
you know they didn't say in this article (94:28 - 94:31)
we've heard from players feedback the 40 (94:29 - 94:33)
Skins are too expensive yeah you didn't (94:31 - 94:35)
hear that because I'm sure those 40 (94:33 - 94:40)
Skins are selling just fine yeah yeah so (94:35 - 94:41)
and the dumb thing about the scratch (94:40 - 94:43)
cards is they add a background that can (94:41 - 94:46)
randomly appear on the character not (94:43 - 94:48)
character selection screen while you're (94:46 - 94:51)
waiting to go into a map sometimes you (94:48 - 94:54)
will get a snowman that appears in the (94:51 - 94:57)
background that's what that's what that (94:54 - 94:58)
like a thousand dollars to get all the (94:57 - 95:00)
postural options that will sometimes (94:58 - 95:03)
slightly it it's installing unite right (95:00 - 95:06)
now for this wow it's exhilarating (95:03 - 95:07)
that's terrible you know it's actually (95:06 - 95:10)
in a pretty good place after this last (95:07 - 95:12)
patch it's super fun and it's (95:10 - 95:15)
I think it's energized the the player (95:12 - 95:16)
base that (95:15 - 95:19)
they are doing something active to fix (95:16 - 95:20)
the biggest problem which is people just (95:19 - 95:22)
sitting (95:20 - 95:25)
back on base and spamming thanks because (95:22 - 95:26)
it (95:25 - 95:29)
triggers that they're playing yeah so (95:26 - 95:31)
this kind of transparency is amazing oh (95:29 - 95:33)
this transparency is like what (95:31 - 95:36)
everybody's wanted and really hope they (95:33 - 95:39)
continue it because knowing that you (95:36 - 95:41)
have a secret rating that is based off (95:39 - 95:43)
of how you play it that you're that (95:41 - 95:44)
they're trying to get you with people (95:43 - 95:46)
who have similar skill level (95:44 - 95:50)
it's really nice to know (95:46 - 95:53)
on it's not fully explained but like (95:50 - 95:56)
this is the system that we use and it it (95:53 - 95:59)
is factoring how good you are as a (95:56 - 96:02)
player and when you see (95:59 - 96:05)
the expanding search parameters your (96:02 - 96:06)
games are about to get wild because who (96:05 - 96:09)
knows who's coming in (96:06 - 96:11)
and they do say here (96:09 - 96:14)
um for like 96 percent of matches were (96:11 - 96:16)
based with similar compositions so if (96:14 - 96:18)
you were solo (96:16 - 96:20)
um you would be against other solos if (96:18 - 96:23)
you were a group of two they would try (96:20 - 96:25)
to pair you with other groups of two yep (96:23 - 96:26)
well two and threes (96:25 - 96:28)
um (96:26 - 96:29)
and (96:28 - 96:32)
uh ideally with those groups they're (96:29 - 96:35)
saying that the skill is within eighty (96:32 - 96:39)
percent of accurate yeah which (96:35 - 96:42)
is not exclusive to Pokemon unite (96:39 - 96:44)
there's like any game like I remember (96:42 - 96:46)
when Greg and I would play Clash Royale (96:44 - 96:48)
and the thing we would hear is like (96:46 - 96:49)
they're purposely giving me hard (96:48 - 96:52)
matchups yeah they're like (96:49 - 96:54)
which I'm sure is happening in like yeah (96:52 - 96:56)
people saying United like oh they (96:54 - 96:57)
purposely are giving me like this harder (96:56 - 96:59)
team so I lose my streak it's (96:57 - 97:01)
interesting because it explains the (96:59 - 97:04)
situation that you run into that you (97:01 - 97:06)
have much better matches at certain (97:04 - 97:08)
times of the day (97:06 - 97:12)
because when it's overly crowded like at (97:08 - 97:14)
night and you get an influx of people (97:12 - 97:16)
that's tends to be when you see the (97:14 - 97:18)
message of (97:16 - 97:20)
expanding parameters and you tend to (97:18 - 97:22)
have a worse experience well this (97:20 - 97:25)
finally explains that yeah we had to (97:22 - 97:26)
expand it out so you're getting (97:25 - 97:28)
unmatched groups you're getting people (97:26 - 97:30)
who are working together against teams (97:28 - 97:33)
that are all solos like they are finally (97:30 - 97:35)
saying this is why that experience (97:33 - 97:36)
happens (97:35 - 97:40)
and this is this is the reason why and (97:36 - 97:42)
and so like you would have a mut like (97:40 - 97:43)
you would do this at two in the morning (97:42 - 97:45)
you'd have a very different experience (97:43 - 97:49)
than you would at 7 pm yeah I mean like (97:45 - 97:51)
if I if I started playing unite around (97:49 - 97:54)
four in the afternoon four Central Time (97:51 - 97:56)
I would play until about maybe eight and (97:54 - 97:58)
then I was like I need to get off yeah (97:56 - 98:00)
because matches will get significantly (97:58 - 98:02)
worse and I cannot get back on until (98:00 - 98:05)
about like one or two a.m yep and then I (98:02 - 98:08)
couldn't go until you know at 6am it's (98:05 - 98:09)
like you I have to get off now because (98:08 - 98:11)
matches are gonna get bad and that's (98:09 - 98:12)
just like you know when like Japanese (98:11 - 98:15)
players the sections would come in and (98:12 - 98:18)
the the system would have too many (98:15 - 98:20)
players that were mismanaged and yeah (98:18 - 98:22)
it's interesting (98:20 - 98:25)
that we finally have (98:22 - 98:28)
just explanations that people could talk (98:25 - 98:31)
about and be like okay I now know why at (98:28 - 98:34)
7 pm my games get worse yeah and you can (98:31 - 98:36)
you can adjust who you play accordingly (98:34 - 98:38)
right like you now that you know that (98:36 - 98:41)
this is happening like okay well I'm not (98:38 - 98:43)
gonna play a supporter when it said (98:41 - 98:44)
expanded (98:43 - 98:46)
things because I don't know what I'm (98:44 - 98:48)
getting as far as play level so it's (98:46 - 98:49)
better to be an attacker because (98:48 - 98:53)
attackers carry easier right like they (98:49 - 98:55)
just do if that lets you pick five (98:53 - 98:56)
azumar rules you know people would pick (98:55 - 98:58)
five of zoomerals that's what we've (98:56 - 99:01)
learned from Violet I mean zumeral is (98:58 - 99:03)
really good in this game (99:01 - 99:06)
but man I'm full in on Save A Lot I've (99:03 - 99:07)
been playing Sableye so much that little (99:06 - 99:11)
Gremlin is so much fun (99:07 - 99:13)
all right well those uh that was all the (99:11 - 99:14)
news I'm sure there was actually more (99:13 - 99:16)
news uh there there's like new stuff on (99:14 - 99:18)
Pokemon Center (99:16 - 99:20)
um but uh (99:18 - 99:26)
the cinder Ace event should start so (99:20 - 99:28)
people also don't understand time zones (99:26 - 99:31)
uh this these events start UT's midnight (99:28 - 99:35)
UTC time uh which is normally on Friday (99:31 - 99:38)
but because if you live in America uh (99:35 - 99:41)
that's about 6 p.m uh on Thursday so the (99:38 - 99:43)
Cinderella should start the 29th around (99:41 - 99:47)
six six-ish pm central-ish you know give (99:43 - 99:48)
or take depending if you have mountains (99:47 - 99:50)
or coasts uh and then that will run (99:48 - 99:52)
through the weekend and then if you miss (99:50 - 99:54)
it cinderace will come back on I believe (99:52 - 99:58)
it is January 12th 13th 14th 15th (99:54 - 99:59)
um (99:58 - 100:01)
UTC stands for universal time (99:59 - 100:04)
coordinated there I did not know what (100:01 - 100:07)
that meant but that makes sense yep so (100:04 - 100:08)
you know (100:07 - 100:11)
we will have our thoughts I suppose (100:08 - 100:13)
about cinderace uh (100:11 - 100:15)
that's New Year's weekend is the first (100:13 - 100:19)
one right like yes so I'm assuming we (100:15 - 100:20)
will probably record on Friday again (100:19 - 100:24)
before the holiday so if we all do one (100:20 - 100:26)
Cinder Ace on Thursday night we will (100:24 - 100:27)
have our thoughts for (100:26 - 100:30)
Monday (100:27 - 100:32)
um and then I don't know if there's a (100:30 - 100:34)
raid on the seventh (100:32 - 100:35)
um (100:34 - 100:37)
but I would assume we have we'll have (100:35 - 100:39)
another raid in January that isn't (100:37 - 100:41)
delibird obviously or what was the Evie (100:39 - 100:43)
Evie Evie was the other one so maybe (100:41 - 100:45)
with a hat (100:43 - 100:47)
we can only hope (100:45 - 100:49)
um and they have done no raids so far of (100:47 - 100:52)
like increased shinies although I don't (100:49 - 100:54)
game's not even two months old I'm sure (100:52 - 100:57)
that is coming uh there's been no raid (100:54 - 100:59)
so far with Urban mystica (100:57 - 101:02)
um which I would argue is like more (100:59 - 101:04)
sought after than Chinese themselves (101:02 - 101:07)
like I can't imagine them doing raids (101:04 - 101:09)
for urban mysticas since that is like (101:07 - 101:11)
the main thing they want you to grind (101:09 - 101:13)
out (101:11 - 101:13)
um (101:13 - 101:16)
but we can talk about more of that in (101:13 - 101:19)
the future but anyways happy holidays (101:16 - 101:21)
thank you for making to the end uh there (101:19 - 101:23)
will probably there probably would have (101:21 - 101:24)
been a weird break slash cut somewhere (101:23 - 101:26)
in this episode we just recorded (101:24 - 101:29)
straight up through for time purposes uh (101:26 - 101:31)
I'll make it all I'll make it sound very (101:29 - 101:32)
great and they're very natural you'll be (101:31 - 101:35)
like wait this is all natural uh we're (101:32 - 101:37)

those (101:42 - 101:48)
we use those power anklets (101:44 - 101:48)
ah (101:48 - 101:52)
if you want Twitter that's probably been (101:50 - 101:53)
up on the screen in the show notes all (101:52 - 101:57)
