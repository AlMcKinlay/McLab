[Music] (0:01 - 0:16)
[Applause] (0:16 - 0:19)
[Music] (0:16 - 0:22)
what's up everyone welcome to the second (0:19 - 0:27)
episode of the super picnic Club I have (0:22 - 0:29)

and we'll do Al the first this time (0:37 - 0:43)
whoa owl the first Al the first hell the (0:40 - 0:46)
first of the long line of L's that will (0:43 - 0:48)
come (0:46 - 0:48)
I think I'd be nervous about that one (0:49 - 0:52)
now (0:51 - 0:55)
uh yeah there's only one owl except (0:52 - 0:57)
Weird Al (0:55 - 0:59)
yes (0:57 - 1:01)
Al the first (0:59 - 1:03)

what can I say (1:03 - 1:09)
Greg also here okay I'm here with our (1:05 - 1:13)
new tagline let's pile it on for paldea (1:09 - 1:15)
sandwiches hoe (1:13 - 1:19)
[Laughter] (1:15 - 1:22)
I think we can Workshop that a bit (1:19 - 1:24)
I didn't think I would say this but I (1:22 - 1:27)
think Steve's is better (1:24 - 1:28)
[Music] (1:27 - 1:32)
L get out bring it down the second (1:28 - 1:36)
get down on standby uh if you if you (1:32 - 1:37)
missed our first episode of the (1:36 - 1:39)
mini-series we talk about all the new (1:37 - 1:41)
Pokemon but we don't talk about the (1:39 - 1:43)
things that appear in area zero and we (1:41 - 1:44)
don't talk about the new Legends so (1:43 - 1:47)
pretty safe for for most people who have (1:44 - 1:50)
just you know enjoyed the game so far (1:47 - 1:51)
um and I don't think there's anything (1:50 - 1:54)
super crazy in the list of tumbleweeds (1:51 - 1:58)
and uh birds that they have introduced (1:54 - 2:01)
tumble Birds the tumble Birds uh today's (1:58 - 2:03)
episode (2:01 - 2:04)
uh we're going to keep these episodes (2:03 - 2:06)
very structured so like if you've only (2:04 - 2:08)
done one storyline that's the whole (2:06 - 2:09)
point of these episodes so you can (2:08 - 2:12)
safely listen to the in this case will (2:09 - 2:15)
be the Titan battles and then not have (2:12 - 2:17)
to worry about like team star stuff (2:15 - 2:18)
spoilers that'll be in different (2:17 - 2:20)
episodes and then you know if you did (2:18 - 2:22)
team Star first uh you could skip this (2:20 - 2:24)
episode and (2:22 - 2:26)
so far and that I think that makes sense (2:24 - 2:27)
I think everyone understands that now (2:26 - 2:30)
they're at the end of all these (2:27 - 2:31)
storylines there is um (2:30 - 2:35)
an extra part like uh the story lines (2:31 - 2:36)
all kind of wrap up together so we're (2:35 - 2:39)
only going to talk about the first five (2:36 - 2:41)
Titans and I have them here in front of (2:39 - 2:42)
me (2:41 - 2:45)
um which are the Sony Cliff Titan the (2:42 - 2:48)
Open Sky Titan the lurking steel Titan (2:45 - 2:51)
the quaking Earth Titan and then the (2:48 - 2:53)
false Dragon Titan so (2:51 - 2:54)
um and then the story that goes along (2:53 - 2:56)
with those five (2:54 - 2:58)
and that's it (2:56 - 3:00)
um and then there there is there is a an (2:58 - 3:03)
uh I'm not like you could finish these (3:00 - 3:06)
five and have a pretty good ending yeah (3:03 - 3:08)
um but there's a there's another part (3:06 - 3:10)
that happens and we'll save that for a (3:08 - 3:12)
future episode because (3:10 - 3:13)
that part requires you to be a little (3:12 - 3:16)
bit stronger in the game (3:13 - 3:16)
for uh yep uh and whether or not that is (3:16 - 3:23)
good or bad (3:21 - 3:24)
um the game (3:23 - 3:26)
lets you do anything you want minus the (3:24 - 3:28)
fact that like it doesn't tell you (3:26 - 3:32)
levels so you can't I mean yeah it it (3:28 - 3:34)
kind of lets you do anything you want (3:32 - 3:36)
but the game is really much very much (3:34 - 3:39)
like oh hey you should be doing it in (3:36 - 3:41)
this particular order because when you (3:39 - 3:43)
go somewhere your phone lights up things (3:41 - 3:45)
are blocking your way there's like giant (3:43 - 3:47)
arrows there's a couple people are like (3:45 - 3:50)
why don't you go check that out don't (3:47 - 3:52)
come this way please (3:50 - 3:54)
it's interesting I don't know whether I (3:52 - 3:57)
just didn't I didn't notice so hmm so I (3:54 - 3:59)
find it really difficult to figure out (3:57 - 4:01)
the order that it wanted you to do (3:59 - 4:04)
things in I figured it out (4:01 - 4:07)
yeah so I just ended up following (4:04 - 4:09)
um I think this list was from Serebii I (4:07 - 4:12)
think but I mean just but is it is it (4:09 - 4:15)
that you TR you wanted to do the order (4:12 - 4:17)
they recommend so every game has like (4:15 - 4:19)
yeah like even even an Elden ring (4:17 - 4:21)
there's like go here first go here first (4:19 - 4:23)
these are the seven sages or whatever (4:21 - 4:24)
they're called an elder ring that you're (4:23 - 4:26)
supposed to do and then like these (4:24 - 4:28)
people are super hard but you can do (4:26 - 4:30)
them whenever (4:28 - 4:32)
um and just like in Elder ring I'm gonna (4:30 - 4:34)
use altering because I I game it's gonna (4:32 - 4:35)
be the game of the year (4:34 - 4:38)
um you know if if like like oh like me (4:35 - 4:40)
and Greg talked about three weeks ago (4:38 - 4:42)
there's like a starter tutorial area in (4:40 - 4:45)
Elden ring I totally missed it when I (4:42 - 4:48)
finally discovered that it was there I (4:45 - 4:52)
breezed through it in seconds right (4:48 - 4:54)
um and I (4:52 - 4:57)
I did the Titan stuff out of order (4:54 - 4:59)
um and I've done other things out of (4:57 - 5:01)
order we'll say for other episodes but (4:59 - 5:04)
about halfway but but when I I knew (5:01 - 5:07)
cloth was first yeah I think I think (5:04 - 5:09)
everyone knew first the game the game (5:07 - 5:12)
tells you the order when they're talking (5:09 - 5:14)
about it they say if you want to do the (5:12 - 5:16)
gyms go west if you want to start with (5:14 - 5:19)
the Daytons go eat yeah right but that (5:16 - 5:21)
but then you go you go west go to the (5:19 - 5:22)
gyms right and you oh well let's do the (5:21 - 5:23)
other way around because we're talking (5:22 - 5:25)
about Titans so you go east to do the (5:23 - 5:27)
Titans and the first Titan is over there (5:25 - 5:31)
yes but then the second Titan is the (5:27 - 5:33)
other side of the map it's not it (5:31 - 5:34)
doesn't go around in a circle or like I (5:33 - 5:35)
assumed that was what was going to (5:34 - 5:37)
happen then the next one up would be the (5:35 - 5:39)
next Titan is not and there's no clear (5:37 - 5:41)
indication that that's the next one you (5:39 - 5:43)
should be doing that's the weird bit I (5:41 - 5:46)
find yeah I mean they were the thing is (5:43 - 5:49)
is that they really clearly wanted you (5:46 - 5:52)
to go to that area and clear the things (5:49 - 5:56)
out like go over here do the gym do the (5:52 - 5:59)
Titan then go to the next gym do the gym (5:56 - 6:01)
do the Titan then go to the next gym do (5:59 - 6:03)
that do that they kind of arranged it (6:01 - 6:05)
they're not in the right order though (6:03 - 6:06)
that's the thing because you go over you (6:05 - 6:08)
do the first Titan and it's like the (6:06 - 6:10)
third gym and then you if you go over (6:08 - 6:12)
and do the first gym it's like the (6:10 - 6:14)
second Titan well it's like a set I mean (6:12 - 6:16)
the grass is technically the second Gym (6:14 - 6:19)
yes by the first Titan but yeah right (6:16 - 6:22)
yeah yes so yeah I mean (6:19 - 6:24)
here here's the thing though so there's (6:22 - 6:26)
there's two things that I think (6:24 - 6:29)
both help the game and hurt the game (6:26 - 6:31)
number one is if you go to the Pokemon (6:29 - 6:33)
Center and you say I don't know what to (6:31 - 6:36)
do she tells you what you can't do which (6:33 - 6:39)
is really great very helpful in an open (6:36 - 6:41)
world game uh that's you know something (6:39 - 6:43)
all the drink doesn't have you I'm I'm (6:41 - 6:45)
just gonna walk and hopefully something (6:43 - 6:47)
over here I can knock out and if it's (6:45 - 6:48)
not I guess I'll pick a different (6:47 - 6:51)
direction like (6:48 - 6:54)
what to do which is awesome she also (6:51 - 6:57)
just tells you what is nearest to that (6:54 - 6:59)
Pokemon Center which is a downfall (6:57 - 7:02)
because when she told me to like oh go (6:59 - 7:04)
do this (7:02 - 7:08)
uh you know go do this gym or team star (7:04 - 7:11)
or whatever right I I thought it was (7:08 - 7:12)
next (7:11 - 7:15)
and when I did it I was like oh this is (7:12 - 7:17)
not yeah next (7:15 - 7:20)
um but then so on the on the flip side (7:17 - 7:23)
that's great but also has its downfalls (7:20 - 7:25)
they could have just programmed the game (7:23 - 7:27)
to say like (7:25 - 7:29)
do this next because that is yeah that (7:27 - 7:32)
is our order like hey maybe you skipped (7:29 - 7:36)
cloth and you did uh Bombardier first (7:32 - 7:40)
the games the game would go like what (7:36 - 7:44)
if you missed a and went to B go back to (7:40 - 7:47)
a like but they don't do that so I I'm (7:44 - 7:48)
curious (7:47 - 7:51)
if they don't do that (7:48 - 7:54)
and because they purposely did what (7:51 - 7:56)
YouTube just said is like there's two (7:54 - 7:57)
things over here but then all of a (7:56 - 7:58)
sudden you gotta go over here but then (7:57 - 8:00)
all of a sudden you gotta go back I that (7:58 - 8:03)
has to be intentional yeah for you to (8:00 - 8:05)
really do it in the order you want and (8:03 - 8:07)
kind of stumble upon to make your own (8:05 - 8:10)
quote-unquote Journey (8:07 - 8:10)
um yeah I think that's fine but like (8:11 - 8:17)
I I think I wanna I wanna go back to (8:15 - 8:20)
because we'd had a you had you had (8:17 - 8:22)
raised the question of whether the (8:20 - 8:24)
Titans were scaled because you couldn't (8:22 - 8:26)
see the levels and there was an (8:24 - 8:27)
interesting question I think it's pretty (8:26 - 8:30)
clear they're not scaled scale they just (8:27 - 8:33)
have hidden hidden fixed levels you can (8:30 - 8:35)
tell at what level they are based on (8:33 - 8:36)
um (8:35 - 8:38)
what's his name (8:36 - 8:41)
's name Arvin (8:38 - 8:43)
is Pokemon tell you pretty much what the (8:41 - 8:46)
levels are yeah yeah (8:43 - 8:50)
um so so they're not but you know it's (8:46 - 8:51)
obviously not simple to say right okay (8:50 - 8:53)
it just needs to be scaled but like I (8:51 - 8:55)
think they either need to do scaling or (8:53 - 8:58)
make it much more clear the order I like (8:55 - 9:00)
not being enforced in that order like on (8:58 - 9:02)
my second playthrough I'm definitely (9:00 - 9:03)
going to go through and do all the (9:02 - 9:06)
Titans first obviously not the the end (9:03 - 9:08)
game type in battle because that's going (9:06 - 9:10)
to be way too hard that early on but I (9:08 - 9:12)
like the idea of getting all of that and (9:10 - 9:14)
then going around and and traversing (9:12 - 9:17)
everything before doing the gym battles (9:14 - 9:18)
um but the first time through you just (9:17 - 9:21)
have you have no clue and it's like yeah (9:18 - 9:22)
you go to the first Titan and then you (9:21 - 9:24)
get the second gym and the second team (9:22 - 9:26)
star I got absolutely Trashed by the (9:24 - 9:28)
second team star because I was not (9:26 - 9:30)
expecting especially as they had the the (9:28 - 9:32)
trailer that showed us the three (9:30 - 9:34)
different things it showed you cloth and (9:32 - 9:35)
then we all assumed that was the first (9:34 - 9:38)
Titan which it is and it showed you yes (9:35 - 9:40)
um the the grass gym which we all (9:38 - 9:42)
assumed was well some most of us assumed (9:40 - 9:43)
was the first gym no it was not the (9:42 - 9:46)
first gym and and they had the the fire (9:43 - 9:48)
team star one which again assumed it was (9:46 - 9:50)
the first the Mela yeah assumed that was (9:48 - 9:51)
the first team start and it wasn't the (9:50 - 9:53)
first team so you've got three things (9:51 - 9:55)
that we assumed were the first three of (9:53 - 9:57)
them all together and they're not and (9:55 - 10:01)
that's really weird yeah (9:57 - 10:03)
to be fair that's team star thing I (10:01 - 10:04)
think mellow is more interesting (10:03 - 10:07)
character but anyways oh yeah that's (10:04 - 10:11)
fair but well compared to the first one (10:07 - 10:11)
the issue that about the order is the (10:13 - 10:19)
issue I had when they said that this was (10:18 - 10:21)
an open game and then also said that it (10:19 - 10:24)
wasn't gonna scale because it's not (10:21 - 10:28)
it is it it is open yeah it is but boy (10:24 - 10:31)
are you gonna have a horrible time I (10:28 - 10:33)
don't think (10:31 - 10:35)
dragging yourself across things I don't (10:33 - 10:38)
think so at all I super disagree (10:35 - 10:40)
um like like the the constant argument (10:38 - 10:42)
is like I wish all the gyms scaled I (10:40 - 10:44)
wish the Titans scaled why (10:42 - 10:47)
why (10:44 - 10:47)
if if if you are Level 20 and you walk (10:47 - 10:54)
into the grass stream and it's 20 it is (10:52 - 10:57)
it it is it is that experience if you (10:54 - 10:58)
are 30 and you walk into the grass (10:57 - 10:59)
stream and it's 30 it is that experience (10:58 - 11:02)
you will never get it there's no point (10:59 - 11:04)
in levels in that point if you're 30 (11:02 - 11:06)
they're 30 if you're 40 they're 40. why (11:04 - 11:08)
have levels to begin with well no it's (11:06 - 11:11)
20 no and they're level 40. I have (11:08 - 11:13)
created a challenge for myself that I (11:11 - 11:15)
can't get if the game Auto scales you (11:13 - 11:17)
scaling doesn't have mean it's always (11:15 - 11:20)
the same level as you right right so if (11:17 - 11:22)
you have like the first gym is always 15 (11:20 - 11:25)
the second gym is always 25. that's (11:22 - 11:28)
scaling it's not the same thing as it's (11:25 - 11:29)
always going to be the same level as you (11:28 - 11:31)
that's a there's different kinds of (11:29 - 11:33)
scaling there right so I'm not saying (11:31 - 11:34)
that yeah they should always be the same (11:33 - 11:36)
level right but the idea of these are (11:34 - 11:39)
the eight levels that the gyms will be (11:36 - 11:42)
at and whichever one you choose to be (11:39 - 11:44)
the first ends up being the first I (11:42 - 11:46)
think is fine I think it's also fair to (11:44 - 11:48)
say that that's that's not a good way to (11:46 - 11:51)
do it and I think that's fair but I (11:48 - 11:52)
think if they're not going to do that (11:51 - 11:54)
they need to make it clear what the (11:52 - 11:55)
order they want you to do it is in and (11:54 - 11:57)
they're not they've not I don't think (11:55 - 11:59)
that's a problem though like if you if (11:57 - 12:02)
you walk into if you walk into a Titan (11:59 - 12:05)
and it's too hard what what what did you (12:02 - 12:08)
actually lose nothing you just go this (12:05 - 12:10)
is too difficult I'll come back later (12:08 - 12:13)
that's all open World Games Fallout (12:10 - 12:15)
Vegas like Elden ring like breath of the (12:13 - 12:19)
wild if it's if it's too hard the the (12:15 - 12:21)
great thing about the open world game is (12:19 - 12:23)
you go somewhere else but what's the (12:21 - 12:26)
what's what's the problem with having a (12:23 - 12:29)
clear what the order is right the the in (12:26 - 12:30)
on the map they all number themselves (12:29 - 12:32)
after you complete them but they don't (12:30 - 12:34)
before you complete them why don't they (12:32 - 12:35)
just have them numbered before as well (12:34 - 12:37)
or I mean I'm sure there is a clear (12:35 - 12:39)
order in breath of the wild of what you (12:37 - 12:42)
should do like which of the uh beasts (12:39 - 12:44)
you should do first and and the temples (12:42 - 12:47)
along the way but like nowhere does (12:44 - 12:48)
breath of the wild they don't tell you (12:47 - 12:50)
that you you need to do this Divine (12:48 - 12:52)
Beast before the other Divine Beast (12:50 - 12:54)
they don't have leveling in the in there (12:52 - 12:56)
though the Divine beasts aren't harder (12:54 - 12:59)
or easier than others yeah um they do (12:56 - 13:00)
different things (12:59 - 13:03)
there (13:00 - 13:03)
for for people like us obviously it (13:04 - 13:06)
doesn't really matter like I can look up (13:05 - 13:08)
a list that's fine but like I'm thinking (13:06 - 13:10)
about for example like my my (13:08 - 13:12)
nine-year-old nephew who's going to get (13:10 - 13:14)
this game at Christmas if he walks into (13:12 - 13:16)
the third Titan battle as his first one (13:14 - 13:18)
or he walks into the second gym as his (13:16 - 13:20)
first one and he's nowhere near leveled (13:18 - 13:21)
because he hasn't he hasn't made it (13:20 - 13:23)
clear to him which one to go to is he (13:21 - 13:25)
gonna keep going I don't I don't know he (13:23 - 13:29)
might yeah kids are I I have no doubt (13:25 - 13:32)
that like kids are kids have every nine (13:29 - 13:34)
year how old has more wins in Apex (13:32 - 13:36)
Legends than I do easy they're they're (13:34 - 13:39)
very they're like (13:36 - 13:39)
certain kinds of kids and I think that (13:40 - 13:45)
some of them will yeah you're right the (13:43 - 13:47)
ones that will turn into us right those (13:45 - 13:50)
ones will continue doing that but there (13:47 - 13:51)
will be kids who won't and they would (13:50 - 13:54)
have a worse time because they're going (13:51 - 13:57)
into into the second Titan and they're (13:54 - 13:59)
getting completely destroyed by it and (13:57 - 14:01)
they don't understand why but what what (13:59 - 14:03)
would be any different from a linear (14:01 - 14:06)
Pokemon game where let's just say sword (14:03 - 14:08)
and shield you get to opal you cannot (14:06 - 14:10)
beat opal you can't progress at all (14:08 - 14:13)
there's nowhere else to go (14:10 - 14:14)
right but I'm not I'm not saying it (14:13 - 14:16)
shouldn't be open world game right I'm (14:14 - 14:18)
saying I like that all I want is a list (14:16 - 14:22)
a list of the order that they want they (14:18 - 14:23)
were having two arguments you're you're (14:22 - 14:26)
you're like because I I don't think that (14:23 - 14:29)
scaling suddenly makes the game better (14:26 - 14:30)
right (14:29 - 14:34)
that's what I think but I do agree with (14:30 - 14:37)
you I do agree with you that there's (14:34 - 14:40)
that the game should communicate in some (14:37 - 14:43)
instance a preferred order that they're (14:40 - 14:47)
suggesting yeah um and it kind of does (14:43 - 14:51)
that if you hover over all 18 circles it (14:47 - 14:54)
will tell you if it's hard or not (14:51 - 14:56)
in the overview of the map if you zoom (14:54 - 14:59)
all the way out it shows all 18 Badges (14:56 - 15:01)
and if you hover over them like it tells (14:59 - 15:04)
you the order of Team star if you hover (15:01 - 15:06)
over the fighting team star it says this (15:04 - 15:08)
is the hardest most difficult member of (15:06 - 15:09)
teamstar it tells you that (15:08 - 15:12)
and then if you hover over Katie who is (15:09 - 15:14)
the bug gym (15:12 - 15:16)
she like if you read her like it well (15:14 - 15:18)
it's not it's like her picture and then (15:16 - 15:20)
it and then it just yeah yeah one (15:18 - 15:22)
paragraph it says like she's a brand new (15:20 - 15:25)
gym leader uh in the entire region or (15:22 - 15:26)
something like that (15:25 - 15:29)
and then like the normal gym it'll say (15:26 - 15:32)
like this is the middle of the road gym (15:29 - 15:35)
which is obviously like four or five I (15:32 - 15:37)
think it's technically five (15:35 - 15:39)
um yeah technically five like it does (15:37 - 15:41)
yeah (15:39 - 15:41)
pretty Niche I don't know right I just (15:41 - 15:46)
did it's like you it's pretty I mean (15:44 - 15:49)
it's on the zoom out of the map (15:46 - 15:51)
yeah you have to go to the map you have (15:49 - 15:53)
to go to the the highest level and then (15:51 - 15:54)
you have to go over where else would (15:53 - 15:56)
they put it where else do you want them (15:54 - 15:58)
to put like the the this is hard this is (15:56 - 16:01)
easy like you're asking me to you're (15:58 - 16:03)
asking me to design things on the spot I (16:01 - 16:04)
mean the initials though I the initial (16:03 - 16:07)
thought I'm just I'm just saying I'm (16:04 - 16:08)
just I'm just saying what you're asking (16:07 - 16:10)
for exists it's just not as maybe (16:08 - 16:13)
cutting it's not just it's not cutting (16:10 - 16:15)
okay fair yeah I I wasn't aware that I (16:13 - 16:16)
existed and I feel like that's part of (16:15 - 16:19)
the problem right like I've played this (16:16 - 16:20)
game night for 20 hours and I didn't (16:19 - 16:22)
know that was a thing I mean to be fair (16:20 - 16:25)
um hundreds of people on my stream and (16:22 - 16:26)
listening to the show didn't know you (16:25 - 16:28)
could lock the map with the R3 button (16:26 - 16:30)
even though on the map screen in the (16:28 - 16:32)
bottom left-hand corner it says R3 and (16:30 - 16:36)
then shows the joystick I mean (16:32 - 16:36)
yeah a lot of people miss the trophies (16:36 - 16:41)
in the Pokedex too so (16:39 - 16:43)
oh they'll get 10. (16:41 - 16:46)
yeah yeah no that's fair I think there (16:43 - 16:48)
are a lot of design issues uh user (16:46 - 16:50)
affordance issues that could be fixed in (16:48 - 16:51)
this game I'm not even sure where the (16:50 - 16:53)
icon was meant to mean until I listened (16:51 - 16:54)
to the podcast I saw it I clicked it and (16:53 - 16:57)
I was like I don't know what that did (16:54 - 16:58)
um it didn't really seem to do anything (16:57 - 17:01)
at the time I mean I think my initial (16:58 - 17:04)
thought is on them on the zoomed out map (17:01 - 17:05)
when you've got the like it shows you (17:04 - 17:07)
Victory Road zero out of eight whatever (17:05 - 17:09)
you can have them listed there for (17:07 - 17:11)
example there are ways you can do this (17:09 - 17:12)
to make it more visible and obvious (17:11 - 17:15)
while not causing issues for other (17:12 - 17:17)
people I I think the the fix you're (17:15 - 17:20)
asking for is just Nurse Joy telling you (17:17 - 17:22)
what should be next I also think they (17:20 - 17:24)
could not it doesn't work additional to (17:22 - 17:27)
the map to give the rough levels of the (17:24 - 17:31)
Pokemon in the areas which we've seen in (17:27 - 17:33)
other games where when you bring up an (17:31 - 17:36)
overlay it will say like you'll expect (17:33 - 17:40)
16 through 20 Level here you know 30 (17:36 - 17:42)
through 50 here so you kind of know (17:40 - 17:44)
because Pokemon is locked behind levels (17:42 - 17:48)
like the good moves are locked behind (17:44 - 17:51)
levels so you can go you can try to go (17:48 - 17:53)
to the Water Gym which I did which was a (17:51 - 17:56)
whole wild experience of itself but (17:53 - 17:58)
because of the way they structure the (17:56 - 18:00)
plot lines in releasing of moves and (17:58 - 18:02)
releasing of levels (18:00 - 18:06)
you even if you think great I have the (18:02 - 18:09)
type advantage I don't have moves that (18:06 - 18:10)
are powerful yet unlocked they're not (18:09 - 18:12)
unlocked to the TM machine I haven't (18:10 - 18:16)
found one and they're locked behind the (18:12 - 18:19)
levels of how my Pokemon progresses so (18:16 - 18:22)
there are these weird locks that keep (18:19 - 18:26)
you at a lower power level because of (18:22 - 18:28)
the level structure which even if you (18:26 - 18:30)
can get to those places (18:28 - 18:32)
you have to try to level up to be able (18:30 - 18:35)
to do them or you or you spent a (18:32 - 18:37)
considerable amount of time (18:35 - 18:40)
whether you found it enjoyable or not is (18:37 - 18:43)
is up to you to get there to be like (18:40 - 18:46)
okay well I'm still locked behind (18:43 - 18:48)
a lot of other things you think (18:46 - 18:53)
is is locking like difficulty or ease of (18:48 - 18:54)
use (18:53 - 18:57)
I think I mean every time I think I use (18:54 - 18:58)
the TM machine three times in my 40 (18:57 - 19:01)
hours I mean I I (18:58 - 19:03)
used I went in there and looked at some (19:01 - 19:05)
but yeah every time you would complete a (19:03 - 19:06)
certain section they're like now more (19:05 - 19:08)
TMS are available yes (19:06 - 19:11)
well the TM machine unlocks from (19:08 - 19:14)
Star right (19:11 - 19:16)
and and more powerful yeah you get them (19:14 - 19:18)
in other ways as well unlocked but yeah (19:16 - 19:20)
you also have to can try to find them in (19:18 - 19:22)
the world too but again that seems to be (19:20 - 19:26)
somewhat random I can't tell if I still (19:22 - 19:29)
can't tell if they respond like you can (19:26 - 19:31)
get Swift like like Swift responds (19:29 - 19:33)
pretty much daily in the like starting (19:31 - 19:36)
area yeah (19:33 - 19:37)
um (19:36 - 19:41)
I I think (19:37 - 19:41)
uh touch on the level scaling thing I I (19:41 - 19:47)
do think they do a good job at giving (19:44 - 19:49)
you multiple options though like right (19:47 - 19:50)
like (19:49 - 19:54)
um Mela and the grass and (19:50 - 19:57)
um are pretty much the same and cloth I (19:54 - 19:59)
would say are pretty much the same level (19:57 - 20:02)
so again it's kind of that that it's (19:59 - 20:04)
kind of that um gold and silver thing (20:02 - 20:07)
that they did uh which you know Greg and (20:04 - 20:09)
I both complained about but you know (20:07 - 20:12)
when you when you get the illusion of (20:09 - 20:15)
well you can do you can do Chuck or you (20:12 - 20:17)
can do Jasmine or you can do what's his (20:15 - 20:19)
name Bryce price (20:17 - 20:20)
um or you could go to like a rage like (20:19 - 20:23)
they're all kind of the same level but (20:20 - 20:25)
it works in this game because there's so (20:23 - 20:28)
much to do yeah (20:25 - 20:28)
to other people I'll say this on here (20:29 - 20:35)
the open world concept covers up a lot (20:32 - 20:37)
of sins (20:35 - 20:40)
it really does a lot it does a lot of (20:37 - 20:42)
work to make these games good because if (20:40 - 20:44)
it was a straight linear path this this (20:42 - 20:46)
game would would not rank very high but (20:44 - 20:48)
because it's open world and you have a (20:46 - 20:50)
huge sense of Freedom the open world (20:48 - 20:52)
covers up (20:50 - 20:55)
just eliminates a lot of problems like (20:52 - 20:56)
pacing (20:55 - 20:59)
and yeah I mean I don't think that's I (20:56 - 21:00)
don't think that's quite Fair because I (20:59 - 21:01)
don't think they would make the same (21:00 - 21:02)
decisions if they were doing a non-open (21:01 - 21:04)
world game right so you could say if (21:02 - 21:05)
this was the exact same game but no open (21:04 - 21:06)
world would be bad yeah but they (21:05 - 21:08)
wouldn't make the exact same game right (21:06 - 21:11)
but I mean open world you know it it is (21:08 - 21:13)
pulling it's doing a lot of work right (21:11 - 21:17)
like it is it is it is really pulling (21:13 - 21:20)
its weight to make this game oh (21:17 - 21:22)
enjoyable I think the pacing is so good (21:20 - 21:25)
because like you can you can ignore it (21:22 - 21:28)
and and still have constant things to do (21:25 - 21:30)
but if you just want to go from gym to (21:28 - 21:31)
gym to Titan to Titan you can just do (21:30 - 21:33)
that too and like because the pacing (21:31 - 21:36)
isn't their programming decision the (21:33 - 21:39)
pacing is your decision you mean like (21:36 - 21:40)
the pacing as like we need to make this (21:39 - 21:42)
route and we need to curate what's on (21:40 - 21:44)
this route right I mean they're still (21:42 - 21:48)
curating areas in each gym like X and (21:44 - 21:51)
y's pacing was terrible very very much (21:48 - 21:53)
so yes so with with an open world (21:51 - 21:56)
concept where you can decide where you (21:53 - 21:57)
want to go they don't have to they don't (21:56 - 21:59)
have to worry about pacing they just set (21:57 - 22:01)
them in the worlds roughly in the (21:59 - 22:03)
middle-ish and say have fun I would (22:01 - 22:05)
imagine though like like there there are (22:03 - 22:08)
eight obviously 18 badges (22:05 - 22:09)
um we're talking about five of them (22:08 - 22:10)
today but if you were to do them in the (22:09 - 22:13)
order of Katie (22:10 - 22:16)
team's first team star second brassius (22:13 - 22:19)
Mella I would I would if you did that (22:16 - 22:22)
linear path of like what they suggest I (22:19 - 22:23)
think the pacing is great (22:22 - 22:26)
like I I think that you would get you (22:23 - 22:28)
would be the correct level and you would (22:26 - 22:31)
explore enough areas to get a variety of (22:28 - 22:32)
Pokemon and there are enough trainers (22:31 - 22:34)
slash wild Pokemon that you will love (22:32 - 22:37)
properly going through as a person that (22:34 - 22:39)
did that kind of (22:37 - 22:41)
yeah I think I think that's I think (22:39 - 22:44)
that's fair but I also think mostly we (22:41 - 22:48)
come we come back to the (22:44 - 22:49)
how do you know that right because (22:48 - 22:51)
because like it we're still talking (22:49 - 22:52)
about like the first couple of areas (22:51 - 22:55)
right like if you go east because you (22:52 - 22:56)
want to do the first Titan and then (22:55 - 22:58)
you're like oh there's a gym here as (22:56 - 22:59)
well oh I can defeat that gym or I can (22:58 - 23:01)
defeat the team star (22:59 - 23:03)
unless you specifically remember oh they (23:01 - 23:05)
said go (23:03 - 23:08)
East to do the first gym which they did (23:05 - 23:09)
that's fair but unless you specifically (23:08 - 23:11)
remember that my automatic reaction and (23:09 - 23:13)
I suspect a lot of people's reaction is (23:11 - 23:14)
to just go around the circle (23:13 - 23:16)
right and you suddenly go up and you're (23:14 - 23:17)
suddenly hitting I don't have that (23:16 - 23:18)
reaction (23:17 - 23:21)
fifth gym well no but you're a very (23:18 - 23:23)
different person right yeah but I do (23:21 - 23:25)
things in a very I I think it's a very (23:23 - 23:26)
different way I think I guess what I (23:25 - 23:29)
looked at the map and I saw that I saw (23:26 - 23:32)
the the two team star up there and I saw (23:29 - 23:34)
the other people and I hovered and they (23:32 - 23:36)
said oh like like if you again I guess I (23:34 - 23:38)
knew the thing when you hover up in the (23:36 - 23:39)
top it all it says like these are (23:38 - 23:41)
difficult difficult difficult and when (23:39 - 23:42)
you hover in the bottom it says like (23:41 - 23:44)
easier easier like I just I looked at (23:42 - 23:47)
the map I don't think people I mean I (23:44 - 23:48)
think I don't think people do it out to (23:47 - 23:51)
Al's point A lot of people do things (23:48 - 23:54)
clockwise and counterclockwise once you (23:51 - 23:55)
start a circle (23:54 - 23:57)
you tend to complete the circle (23:55 - 23:59)
that is generally how people approach (23:57 - 24:01)
things because the circle is pretty much (23:59 - 24:04)
however so the years of people being (24:01 - 24:06)
like I hate linear Pokemon games they (24:04 - 24:09)
just want linear in a circle like I (24:06 - 24:11)
think they I I think I think it's not (24:09 - 24:13)
really open world if they they just (24:11 - 24:15)
designed the game to go in a circle (24:13 - 24:16)
like the whole point of putting things (24:15 - 24:18)
on one side of the world and the other (24:16 - 24:20)
side of the world of like go cloth on (24:18 - 24:22)
the the the the West the east coast and (24:20 - 24:25)
then go to Bombardier on the west coast (24:22 - 24:27)
is to force you to explore in between (24:25 - 24:29)
like it it wasn't accordingly they (24:27 - 24:31)
didn't like randomly drop them on the (24:29 - 24:33)
map right but they don't make it clear (24:31 - 24:35)
that you need to do that right I don't (24:33 - 24:38)
think they need to I think they need to (24:35 - 24:39)
do they come to an impasse I think then (24:38 - 24:41)
yeah I think they need to in the sense (24:39 - 24:44)
of like if a person is legitimately (24:41 - 24:47)
stuck and unsure what to do I do agree (24:44 - 24:49)
that nurse Joyce should say this is your (24:47 - 24:51)
next task instead of saying this is the (24:49 - 24:55)
task nearest to you but just like if you (24:51 - 24:57)
were to get to Misty in red and blue and (24:55 - 25:01)
you can't beat Misty you have now (24:57 - 25:03)
stopped your progress of the entire game (25:01 - 25:06)
and your only option is like you lose to (25:03 - 25:08)
her but now you have to stay and you (25:06 - 25:09)
can't even backtrack because of Mount (25:08 - 25:12)
Moon that was bad but you you you now (25:09 - 25:14)
have nugget bridge and you have root (25:12 - 25:16)
seven that you have to grind on and (25:14 - 25:19)
that's it and I think a person is more (25:16 - 25:22)
willing to quit that experience instead (25:19 - 25:25)
of this experience of like I couldn't (25:22 - 25:28)
beat Bombardier that's fine what's over (25:25 - 25:31)
here there's something a little bit (25:28 - 25:32)
lower or a little bit higher and even if (25:31 - 25:34)
something was a little bit higher you (25:32 - 25:36)
might have the right Pokemon (25:34 - 25:39)
um I think you I think you believe that (25:36 - 25:41)
people are more likely to that I know a (25:39 - 25:44)
lot of people who are like I'm done this (25:41 - 25:45)
is the roadblock that I'm not getting (25:44 - 25:48)
past I think yeah I think the people are (25:45 - 25:51)
divided equally between I can't do this (25:48 - 25:53)
I'm done because I don't know where to (25:51 - 25:55)
go and the game isn't helping me and the (25:53 - 25:57)
people who are like I love exploring (25:55 - 25:59)
I'll just go somewhere else I think it's (25:57 - 26:02)
a pretty divided group (25:59 - 26:05)
and to say I think more people would do (26:02 - 26:07)
this than that I don't I don't think (26:05 - 26:08)
that's a valid (26:07 - 26:10)
statement because (26:08 - 26:12)
we have brilliant Diamond shining Pro (26:10 - 26:13)
where people just they were just like I (26:12 - 26:15)
can't beat sin I I can't beat Cynthia (26:13 - 26:17)
and I don't know where to grind and I'm (26:15 - 26:20)
done in this game you have places to go (26:17 - 26:22)
to do that you also have experience (26:20 - 26:24)
candy as well like you you can literally (26:22 - 26:28)
just jump into a raid with friends and (26:24 - 26:31)
be distracted and or get help you (26:28 - 26:33)
couldn't do that in bdsp (26:31 - 26:37)
um like like there there is a difficulty (26:33 - 26:39)
wall that you hit (26:37 - 26:41)
with certain things like Cynthia like if (26:39 - 26:42)
I can't beat Cynthia and I can't see (26:41 - 26:44)
credits I I guess I'm not seeing any (26:42 - 26:46)
post game if you can't beat Bombardier (26:44 - 26:49)
you you can go other places there's so (26:46 - 26:52)
much world to go to right again I'm not (26:49 - 26:54)
saying that this shouldn't be a an open (26:52 - 26:56)
world Pokemon game I actually really (26:54 - 26:58)
like that aspect of it and I think it's (26:56 - 26:59)
interesting I do think that you can (26:58 - 27:01)
challenge in any order kind of doesn't (26:59 - 27:03)
really make sense when you have leveling (27:01 - 27:05)
like it does with if you think about (27:03 - 27:06)
breath of the wild or if you think about (27:05 - 27:11)
Elden ring like this level just the oh (27:06 - 27:13)
okay but you can theoretically I mean (27:11 - 27:14)
I've never played it right but you can (27:13 - 27:16)
theoretically and like there's a lot of (27:14 - 27:18)
skill in that right there's not it's not (27:16 - 27:19)
just there's a lot of skill in Pokemon (27:18 - 27:20)
holy (27:19 - 27:22)
cows (27:20 - 27:27)
so I don't want to do that like like if (27:22 - 27:29)
you go if you go to a gym leader with (27:27 - 27:31)
level 60 Pokemon and you have level 20 (27:29 - 27:33)
Pokemon there is nothing you can do to (27:31 - 27:36)
fix not true super not true (27:33 - 27:39)
not true at all I've proved it multiple (27:36 - 27:40)
times over the weekend as it was (27:39 - 27:42)
possible some bizarre Niche issues (27:40 - 27:45)
possibly like you're you know like look (27:42 - 27:47)
look if I watch somebody play Eldon ring (27:45 - 27:49)
and they're they're doing a no armor run (27:47 - 27:51)
and they're doing bass weapon based (27:49 - 27:55)
sword and they they beat the the big old (27:51 - 27:58)
got so when when you leave Eldon ring (27:55 - 28:00)
for the first time when you get into the (27:58 - 28:03)
breath of the Wild open sunset here we (28:00 - 28:06)
go they put a huge Cree like night on a (28:03 - 28:09)
horse and you're level five when you (28:06 - 28:11)
walk out there there it is almost (28:09 - 28:13)
impossible 99 of players will not be (28:11 - 28:15)
able to defeat that dude that dude is (28:13 - 28:17)
like level 40 right out the gate and (28:15 - 28:19)
it's there to be like this guy can one (28:17 - 28:22)
shot you like you need to leave this (28:19 - 28:25)
starting area because we put the one of (28:22 - 28:27)
the hardest dudes for you right here you (28:25 - 28:28)
need to either go north south you cannot (28:27 - 28:30)
beat him there are people that can beat (28:28 - 28:31)
him (28:30 - 28:34)
and and I I applaud those people because (28:31 - 28:36)
I couldn't I came back when I was 40. I (28:34 - 28:38)
and I beat him when I was 40. I did try (28:36 - 28:39)
to do it when I was 20 I couldn't do it (28:38 - 28:42)
but like the the whole concept of like (28:39 - 28:44)
if if the gym leader 60 and you're 40 (28:42 - 28:47)
you can't win not true done it multiple (28:44 - 28:49)
times this weekend didn't say 40. right (28:47 - 28:50)
there's a big difference I beat (28:49 - 28:52)
alternate crosma with a level 15 (28:50 - 28:54)
basketball and he was level 60. it's (28:52 - 28:56)
totally possible you have to understand (28:54 - 28:58)
the rules and and what Pokemon is asking (28:56 - 29:01)
for you you can beat Mela with like a (28:58 - 29:04)
level two Char Cadet because Mella has (29:01 - 29:06)
no moves that can actually hit you (29:04 - 29:08)
because Flash Fire absorbs it like there (29:06 - 29:10)
are so many situations where you can win (29:08 - 29:12)
because you understand the abilities (29:10 - 29:15)
like you can you can almost solo the the (29:12 - 29:17)
electric type gym leader with with just (29:15 - 29:18)
a ground type Pokemon (29:17 - 29:20)
okay okay right fine fine my point (29:18 - 29:21)
wasn't wasn't about that right because (29:20 - 29:23)
we were talking about how I actually do (29:21 - 29:25)
like the open world Pokemon game right I (29:23 - 29:26)
like the idea of it (29:25 - 29:28)
um I'm not sure I would say that I want (29:26 - 29:29)
every Pokemon game to be open world in (29:28 - 29:32)
the future but I like it uh (29:29 - 29:35)
so I'm not I'm not arguing against that (29:32 - 29:38)
what I'm saying is I think the I think (29:35 - 29:39)
they just need something and I'm not (29:38 - 29:41)
sure exactly what that is I think that (29:39 - 29:43)
we need some some good designers to (29:41 - 29:45)
figure out the best way to do that but I (29:43 - 29:46)
don't think they do a good job of (29:45 - 29:48)
telling you the order of things that's (29:46 - 29:50)
that's literally all I'm saying and I (29:48 - 29:51)
think it's fair to not care about that (29:50 - 29:53)
or to think it's good enough that's fine (29:51 - 29:55)
but I think that there were many people (29:53 - 29:57)
who will have an issue with this game (29:55 - 29:59)
because of that and I didn't but that's (29:57 - 30:00)
because I looked at a list of the (29:59 - 30:02)
ordering to do it (30:00 - 30:04)
yeah and I I (30:02 - 30:06)
think they do try to communicate it (30:04 - 30:08)
suddenly I don't think it's maybe the (30:06 - 30:11)
best but that's the problem the math the (30:08 - 30:14)
map does tell you yeah uh and (30:11 - 30:17)
my problem is I think everything I think (30:14 - 30:19)
all of those all of those issues get (30:17 - 30:22)
solved if Nurse Joy just tells you (30:19 - 30:24)
where to go next instead of what is (30:22 - 30:26)
nearest I actually think her telling you (30:24 - 30:29)
what is nearest is actually kind of a (30:26 - 30:31)
detriment to the game yeah I would agree (30:29 - 30:33)
with that 100 (30:31 - 30:36)
like she she told me to go to a certain (30:33 - 30:39)
team player Member First and I sorry (30:36 - 30:41)
team star and I should have went to a (30:39 - 30:43)
totally different one that I that I (30:41 - 30:45)
didn't even know existed (30:43 - 30:47)
and if she if she just told me like hey (30:45 - 30:51)
like the game knows the order yep (30:47 - 30:53)
yeah like I I already remember the gym (30:51 - 30:55)
leader order and I I remember the Titan (30:53 - 30:58)
order and I did I did so here well let's (30:55 - 30:59)
talk about the Titans Now That We're (30:58 - 31:01)
Here 30 minutes in (30:59 - 31:03)
did you guys do the Titans in order (31:01 - 31:07)
cloth Bombardier earthworm great Tusk (31:03 - 31:09)
iron shred uh (31:07 - 31:12)
because I was following my list (31:09 - 31:14)
uh I did (31:12 - 31:18)
I did cloth first (31:14 - 31:18)
what did I do next I heard some people (31:21 - 31:27)
did great Tusk second a lot I I heard a (31:23 - 31:29)
lot of people did great touches great (31:27 - 31:30)
tusk (31:29 - 31:33)
fourth no I think so I think I did (31:30 - 31:36)
no I did cloth (31:33 - 31:37)
then I did (31:36 - 31:41)
earthworm then it did Bombardier (31:37 - 31:43)
Bombardier or whatever you want to say (31:41 - 31:45)
Denna did great Tusk then I did false (31:43 - 31:48)
dragon (31:45 - 31:48)
I think oh cerebii has the levels for it (31:49 - 31:54)
so I I would say that the Titan (31:52 - 31:58)
storyline is the easiest of the three (31:54 - 32:01)
and the reason I would say that is (31:58 - 32:04)
because there's there's two modes (32:01 - 32:07)
there's the Titan and then it eats the (32:04 - 32:12)
urban mystica which is short for hhms (32:07 - 32:15)
it's long for hips it's long frame gems (32:12 - 32:17)
yes uh which makes as long as your bike (32:15 - 32:21)
your bike gets more a ancient like Surf (32:17 - 32:22)
and stuff (32:21 - 32:25)
um and then you get round two with Arvin (32:22 - 32:29)
that's his name right yeah and and even (32:25 - 32:31)
if you're under leveled or you brought (32:29 - 32:34)
the wrong Pokemon Arvin is probably one (32:31 - 32:38)
of the best NPCs to stand like like yeah (32:34 - 32:40)
compare it to Marnie compared to Cheryl (32:38 - 32:43)
like he brings competent Pokemon and he (32:40 - 32:46)
like actually does something yeah he's (32:43 - 32:49)
he knows what to do why you're doing it (32:46 - 32:51)
and is there to help (32:49 - 32:55)
and is also there to distract so that in (32:51 - 32:57)
the case of the false Titan (32:55 - 32:59)
we're jumping around real quick but (32:57 - 33:01)
these are most mechanics not story uh (32:59 - 33:04)
having gastrodon even though I was 25 (33:01 - 33:09)
levels below the the false dragon (33:04 - 33:12)
like he only had one move he could use (33:09 - 33:14)
against me and it was order up I believe (33:12 - 33:18)
and so it was a 25 chance he was going (33:14 - 33:21)
to use order up and then a 50 chance he (33:18 - 33:23)
targeted me (33:21 - 33:25)
um and even if he did Target me gastron (33:23 - 33:27)
is so bulky that I would be able to (33:25 - 33:29)
survive it (33:27 - 33:30)
at least one (33:29 - 33:32)
um so that's why I was able to do that (33:30 - 33:35)
one 25 levels under uh (33:32 - 33:37)
but I but I think that's okay I don't (33:35 - 33:39)
think that's a complaint that that (33:37 - 33:42)
storyline is easier because of Arvin uh (33:39 - 33:44)
because I think the opposite for team (33:42 - 33:46)
star is a different conversation yeah (33:44 - 33:48)
and I think the gym leaders is that (33:46 - 33:52)
middle traditional line yep I agree (33:48 - 33:54)
um oh interesting (33:52 - 33:55)
there's a reason why I think team star (33:54 - 33:58)
is significantly harder for (33:55 - 34:00)
like maybe like an average player or a (33:58 - 34:02)
new Pokemon person a presumably we'll (34:00 - 34:03)
have that conversation in a few drinks (34:02 - 34:05)
yeah later that's probably the one I'm (34:03 - 34:08)
most excited for so (34:05 - 34:12)
Story the plot line of this one I think (34:08 - 34:15)
Pokemon incredible does (34:12 - 34:20)
small storylines best right like this is (34:15 - 34:22)
a tiny personal story (34:20 - 34:26)
and because it's tiny and personal you (34:22 - 34:28)
can connect to it better (34:26 - 34:29)
it is (34:28 - 34:32)
incredibly predictable and paint by (34:29 - 34:33)
numbers (34:32 - 34:37)
but it's still Charming right like there (34:33 - 34:39)
was nothing there was not a thing about (34:37 - 34:42)
that storyline I'm like I'm shocked (34:39 - 34:46)
wow I didn't see that coming because the (34:42 - 34:49)
shock not the the the second Titan and (34:46 - 34:51)
so the game is smart enough to know (34:49 - 34:53)
with the Titan order which is great (34:51 - 34:56)
right like you'll get arvin's second (34:53 - 34:58)
tight like I got his second cut scene on (34:56 - 35:01)
cloth and you know people got his second (34:58 - 35:03)
cut scene on Bombardier (35:01 - 35:06)
uh or whatever you did second grade Tusk (35:03 - 35:07)
iron threads (35:06 - 35:08)
um (35:07 - 35:11)
so like I actually (35:08 - 35:13)
you're right Greg is in like once it (35:11 - 35:15)
unveils what it is it's predictable but (35:13 - 35:17)
like you don't know why you're getting (35:15 - 35:20)
the urban mystica and he and like Arvin (35:17 - 35:21)
is pretty like I don't know if I trust (35:20 - 35:23)
this guy he could be the bad guy (35:21 - 35:26)
um like when he actually like opens up (35:23 - 35:29)
and reveals what's going to happen you (35:26 - 35:31)
then you you then know the superhero (35:29 - 35:33)
story like superhero saves the day we (35:31 - 35:36)
know the ending of it but like his (35:33 - 35:39)
intentions were hidden for two Titans I (35:36 - 35:41)
did I disagree (35:39 - 35:44)
because you saw I knew the minute I knew (35:41 - 35:47)
the minute I fed the first sandwich (35:44 - 35:50)
to my bike (35:47 - 35:51)
and then he's like I'm finding more (35:50 - 35:53)
ingredients like oh I know exactly what (35:51 - 35:56)
this is I know plot by pop Point by (35:53 - 35:58)
Point what the storyline is gonna be and (35:56 - 35:59)
it and it was (35:58 - 36:02)
Greg's just clever enough Steve (35:59 - 36:05)
I I thought the I thought his whole (36:02 - 36:07)
storyline was so good and it's a very (36:05 - 36:09)
very good story even though saying it's (36:07 - 36:12)
it's predictable it is hot I mean all of (36:09 - 36:14)
that's the thing all of them are (36:12 - 36:16)
incredibly predictable I will say that (36:14 - 36:18)
about all of them I knew exactly the (36:16 - 36:20)
beat points the minute I did the first (36:18 - 36:23)
one like I'm like nothing here is (36:20 - 36:25)
surprising but but (36:23 - 36:30)
what they do well is it is still a charm (36:25 - 36:32)
they do it in a Charming way that I (36:30 - 36:34)
don't care that it's predictable because (36:32 - 36:37)
I'm still emotionally connecting with it (36:34 - 36:40)
right like it is a small (36:37 - 36:41)
good (36:40 - 36:43)
predictable (36:41 - 36:48)
but heartwarming story and they do it (36:43 - 36:50)
well right like the characters are (36:48 - 36:53)
believable the the Beats when they hit (36:50 - 36:54)
them are believable they're not (36:53 - 36:57)
surprising but I'm like oh this is (36:54 - 37:00)
heartwarming I I have grown to care (36:57 - 37:03)
about this character I see that they've (37:00 - 37:06)
made an arc it's built other things so (37:03 - 37:09)
when Pokemon does small stories they (37:06 - 37:11)
really do them well and that's I think (37:09 - 37:14)
what all of these are although I think (37:11 - 37:17)
the gym ones is the weakest (37:14 - 37:20)
um I I do think they they decided to (37:17 - 37:23)
tell a much smaller more personal (37:20 - 37:26)
storyline with this game and it suits (37:23 - 37:28)
the game well (37:26 - 37:30)
I agree that the gym is the weakest but (37:28 - 37:32)
not because it's bad I think I'm not (37:30 - 37:34)
saying it's bad I think the gym one is (37:32 - 37:36)
incredible but out of the three yes I (37:34 - 37:39)
would agree that it's like the weakest (37:36 - 37:42)
but that it's the this Gen 5 fans must (37:39 - 37:44)
be in shambles the only thing that that (37:42 - 37:46)
that they had going for them that was (37:44 - 37:48)
the quote unquote that game had the best (37:46 - 37:50)
story and I already disagreed with that (37:48 - 37:51)
I thought I thought sun and moon had a (37:50 - 37:54)
better story Oh Heaven has the best (37:51 - 37:57)
story but but like (37:54 - 37:59)
even one of these stories I think is (37:57 - 38:03)
better than sun and moon or or black and (37:59 - 38:05)
white like I I think that these stories (38:03 - 38:08)
are so good because even though like you (38:05 - 38:09)
could say like oh it's predictable or oh (38:08 - 38:11)
like I saw it coming sure like when you (38:09 - 38:14)
go to see the next X-Man X-Men movie (38:11 - 38:15)
like you know what's gonna happen you (38:14 - 38:17)
know they're gonna win and if they the (38:15 - 38:18)
only reason they don't win is because (38:17 - 38:19)
they're going to give you a sequel where (38:18 - 38:22)
then the next movie they win right like (38:19 - 38:26)
the the writing and the characteristics (38:22 - 38:28)
that uh that happened with your (38:26 - 38:30)
interactions between you and Arvin are (38:28 - 38:32)
just great like I I think it's (38:30 - 38:33)
underestimate all right I don't think (38:32 - 38:37)
enough people are talking about how well (38:33 - 38:40)
written these characters are like their (38:37 - 38:43)
dialogue actually feels like a human (38:40 - 38:45)
wrote it instead of well we need to save (38:43 - 38:48)
the world storyline and uh (38:45 - 38:50)
I don't know make them say something (38:48 - 38:53)
zany and mean and like I don't know give (38:50 - 38:56)
these grunts like uh like capture this (38:53 - 38:57)
Pokemon and say you're not getting it (38:56 - 39:00)
back you're like like past Pokemon games (38:57 - 39:03)
relied on so many tropes that were just (39:00 - 39:05)
like yep we've been here done that yep (39:03 - 39:08)
that's a bad guy and this game is Trope (39:05 - 39:09)
heavy (39:08 - 39:14)
this game is Hardcore Trope heavy (39:09 - 39:17)
hardcore you cannot tell me that arvin's (39:14 - 39:19)
storyline isn't a Trope when I can point (39:17 - 39:24)
you to a 15. overall story is a story (39:19 - 39:26)
that's been told but the way arvin's (39:24 - 39:29)
dialogue is written and and how it's (39:26 - 39:32)
integrated into the Pokemon world it (39:29 - 39:35)
makes it amazing it makes it good but (39:32 - 39:36)
it's still a trope (39:35 - 39:39)
they just write it well but you can't (39:36 - 39:41)
say it's not a Trope it is even even (39:39 - 39:44)
okay so let me maybe let me switch this (39:41 - 39:45)
around (39:44 - 39:49)
there was even if team Flair and (39:45 - 39:52)
lysanders dialogue was amazing that (39:49 - 39:55)
story was still dog water (39:52 - 39:58)
well I mean this is like a very safe (39:55 - 40:00)
story (39:58 - 40:03)
arvin's like like how he's written the (40:00 - 40:06)
Lysander storyline the Galler storyline (40:03 - 40:08)
are huge in problems where they're (40:06 - 40:11)
talking about an incredibly large (40:08 - 40:14)
problem right like we are running out of (40:11 - 40:17)
World Resources and does Pokemon have an (40:14 - 40:19)
answer to that (40:17 - 40:21)
no so they have nowhere to go when (40:19 - 40:24)
they're trying to answer those questions (40:21 - 40:27)
here they bring it in small like they (40:24 - 40:29)
did in sun and moon when they say here (40:27 - 40:33)
is a small personal story and they do (40:29 - 40:36)
have an answer for that they do have a (40:33 - 40:38)
path a well-trod path that they can say (40:36 - 40:41)
here we are and we're answering the (40:38 - 40:42)
question and I'm not saying they didn't (40:41 - 40:46)
do it great they did it amazing but it's (40:42 - 40:49)
because they kept it small like they (40:46 - 40:51)
realized but now you're just falling for (40:49 - 40:53)
the marketing (40:51 - 40:55)
what are you talking about the three (40:53 - 40:57)
stories have always existed there's (40:55 - 40:59)
always been the the gym Story the (40:57 - 41:02)
legendaries that is not what I'm saying (40:59 - 41:04)
I'm saying the scope of those three (41:02 - 41:07)
stories are smaller and more personal (41:04 - 41:09)
I'm not saying they're different I'm (41:07 - 41:12)
saying the the problem that they are (41:09 - 41:15)
asking and solving is on a much smaller (41:12 - 41:19)
and personal scale (41:15 - 41:19)
you're not trying to solve a worldwide (41:19 - 41:26)
environmental crash issue you're trying (41:23 - 41:28)
to help a person who's in need that's a (41:26 - 41:30)
smaller more personal story and they do (41:28 - 41:34)
it well just like in sun and moon it's a (41:30 - 41:35)
smaller story because you're really (41:34 - 41:39)
helping a person in need it is small it (41:35 - 41:41)
is not world spanning it's not a thing (41:39 - 41:43)
that you're like how do you stop the sky (41:41 - 41:46)
from of pollution from falling you're (41:43 - 41:47)
not having to answer that question (41:46 - 41:50)
you're saying how am I helping this (41:47 - 41:53)
human being who's in need and that is a (41:50 - 41:56)
story Pokemon does very very well and (41:53 - 41:59)
they did it great here (41:56 - 42:01)
that is what I'm saying (41:59 - 42:05)
yes and what I am saying (42:01 - 42:05)
is that Pokemon has gotten so into I (42:05 - 42:14)
need to save the world (42:11 - 42:18)
in almost all of their games and even in (42:14 - 42:19)
gen 1 you didn't really have to save the (42:18 - 42:23)
world right like like Giovanni was doing (42:19 - 42:24)
stuff and like you scared him off but (42:23 - 42:26)
there was no like (42:24 - 42:29)
unless I'm wrong like even as a 10 year (42:26 - 42:30)
old I didn't think I was saving the (42:29 - 42:33)
world I was just like oh it was implied (42:30 - 42:34)
that they were taking trying to take (42:33 - 42:36)
over the world uh it's implied that they (42:34 - 42:38)
literally take over the city right (42:36 - 42:39)
they're trying to take over they take (42:38 - 42:42)
over a city yeah it's implied that they (42:39 - 42:44)
are a worldwide threat (42:42 - 42:46)
uh (42:44 - 42:49)
but but in all of these games where (42:46 - 42:52)
there's this you need to save the world (42:49 - 42:55)
that that has never the your gym your (42:52 - 42:58)
gym storyline is always still separate (42:55 - 43:00)
it just that gets in the way so we still (42:58 - 43:03)
have the two stories of (43:00 - 43:06)
um something to save the world your gym (43:03 - 43:09)
story and then usually a a third story (43:06 - 43:11)
yeah and (43:09 - 43:16)
so the the team star is not save the (43:11 - 43:18)
world right but they're still in your (43:16 - 43:21)
way right and that and they they got (43:18 - 43:23)
away from the save the world right and (43:21 - 43:25)
then the the legendary (43:23 - 43:28)
thing is its own story yeah because (43:25 - 43:30)
you're still you're still trying to (43:28 - 43:31)
figure out what's up with your Legend (43:30 - 43:33)
yeah and you're you're healing the dog (43:31 - 43:35)
yeah and then you have the gym story (43:33 - 43:39)
yeah and so all three are still there (43:35 - 43:42)
yeah that has existed in old games it's (43:39 - 43:44)
just that they're they're they're (43:42 - 43:46)
layered on top of each of each other so (43:44 - 43:48)
you're you're stuck okay so how does (43:46 - 43:52)
that negate what I was saying (43:48 - 43:52)
you're saying that the story is like on (43:53 - 43:59)
its works because it's so small but you (43:56 - 44:01)
could take part you could take the (43:59 - 44:02)
stories from older ones and break them (44:01 - 44:04)
into smaller parts no but that's not (44:02 - 44:06)
what I'm saying by their small I'm (44:04 - 44:08)
saying the stakes are small (44:06 - 44:11)
the stakes of all the storyline aren't (44:08 - 44:13)
world disasters the stakes of each of (44:11 - 44:16)
these stories are personal (44:13 - 44:19)
they are personal they are between a few (44:16 - 44:22)
people not a population (44:19 - 44:23)
that's why I'm saying that they're (44:22 - 44:25)
smaller stories because they're (44:23 - 44:28)
affecting fewer people and when Pokemon (44:25 - 44:32)
doesn't try to have an answer for a (44:28 - 44:34)
world global problem like limited (44:32 - 44:36)
resources (44:34 - 44:40)
cash strap Society no water and no water (44:36 - 44:42)
and they don't have an answer for that (44:40 - 44:44)
those storylines go nowhere because (44:42 - 44:46)
they're like well we don't know how to (44:44 - 44:47)
solve this either (44:46 - 44:49)
so what they did in Sun and Moon and (44:47 - 44:51)
what they did here (44:49 - 44:54)
thankfully is say we don't care we're (44:51 - 44:57)
not solving a world crisis we're making (44:54 - 44:59)
a human connection and it works (44:57 - 45:01)
brilliantly and that's what I mean by (44:59 - 45:04)
it's a smaller Story the scope of what (45:01 - 45:07)
they're trying to do is only affecting a (45:04 - 45:10)
few people and they do it really well (45:07 - 45:12)
yes (45:10 - 45:13)
it's interesting because I've never (45:12 - 45:15)
really considered this but but you're (45:13 - 45:18)
right like every time there is a massive (45:15 - 45:20)
issue we're never solving that issue (45:18 - 45:22)
we're just taking down the person who's (45:20 - 45:25)
trying to solve the issue (45:22 - 45:29)
and moving on it's like okay we stopped (45:25 - 45:31)
whatever Rose's plan was we haven't (45:29 - 45:33)
solved an energy crisis because we don't (45:31 - 45:36)
know how we're just gonna move on I mean (45:33 - 45:39)
X and Y like the flower cannon comes out (45:36 - 45:40)
of the ground and we shut down Lysander (45:39 - 45:42)
but like that town is still destroyed (45:40 - 45:44)
well and that's the problem with a lot (45:42 - 45:47)
of their when they do these worlds like (45:44 - 45:49)
when they decide to bring up an issue (45:47 - 45:51)
that is world spanning (45:49 - 45:54)
we don't have an answer as humans and (45:51 - 45:56)
neither do they so the plot lines just (45:54 - 45:58)
sort of end like stop the bad guy (45:56 - 46:01)
and then we're just going to be done and (45:58 - 46:03)
I think that's the been the problem with (46:01 - 46:05)
a lot of Pokemon story lines why people (46:03 - 46:07)
think they're bad is because (46:05 - 46:09)
they are asking questions that they (46:07 - 46:13)
can't possibly answer and in Sun and (46:09 - 46:14)
Moon they said well we're not going to (46:13 - 46:15)
do a world thing we're going to get it (46:14 - 46:17)
personal and in this one they said we're (46:15 - 46:19)
not going to do a world thing we're (46:17 - 46:22)
going to keep it personal and it works (46:19 - 46:25)
brilliantly (46:22 - 46:27)
the Sun and Moon that it's still the (46:25 - 46:29)
ultra Beast are invading we don't know (46:27 - 46:30)
how to stop it yes but yeah your point (46:29 - 46:33)
still stands but but the big story that (46:30 - 46:36)
they are doing is the Lily story and (46:33 - 46:38)
yeah and the family Dynamic and that is (46:36 - 46:41)
the Big Bear of sun and moon we do (46:38 - 46:42)
actually solve the problem in Sun and (46:41 - 46:44)
Moon because this is the problem in Sun (46:42 - 46:46)
and Moon is the ultra beasts they are (46:44 - 46:48)
explicitly the problem rather than (46:46 - 46:50)
something else that they're trying to (46:48 - 46:53)
solve I I but the the other problem in (46:50 - 46:55)
Sun and Moon is like (46:53 - 46:58)
they don't actually like (46:55 - 47:01)
loosamine the answer to lucamine was (46:58 - 47:02)
like oh she's getting better right and (47:01 - 47:04)
you just have to assume that she's (47:02 - 47:05)
getting better and then like Lily gets (47:04 - 47:07)
on a boat to go to Kanto and everyone (47:05 - 47:08)
was like I want Canto remix and then we (47:07 - 47:09)
got Canter remix and then everyone was (47:08 - 47:10)
mad (47:09 - 47:11)
um (47:10 - 47:14)
like I mean the answer the answer wasn't (47:11 - 47:16)
what happened to loosamine the answer (47:14 - 47:19)
was what Lily decided to do that was the (47:16 - 47:21)
answer to that problem the answer to (47:19 - 47:23)
what do you do when your parents are (47:21 - 47:26)
horrible to you is (47:23 - 47:29)
you decide to finally break for them and (47:26 - 47:31)
start your own life right like the point (47:29 - 47:33)
of that storyline is literally finally (47:31 - 47:35)
getting your Independence which is what (47:33 - 47:37)
they're telling kids like you can have (47:35 - 47:39)
bad parents (47:37 - 47:41)
get your own independence and you can (47:39 - 47:43)
still start your own Journey even though (47:41 - 47:45)
you had a bad beginning they answered (47:43 - 47:48)
the question of what to do because at (47:45 - 47:49)
that point we don't care what happens to (47:48 - 47:51)
Lisa mean nor should you care what (47:49 - 47:54)
happens to your toxic parent right like (47:51 - 47:56)
the point of that is it's okay to leave (47:54 - 47:58)
your toxic parents and start your own (47:56 - 48:00)
life that's the answer to that storyline (47:58 - 48:03)
is why sun and moon still has the best (48:00 - 48:05)
storyline well I I (48:03 - 48:07)
I think this is better (48:05 - 48:09)
uh I think all three storylines are (48:07 - 48:11)
better and the reason is I'm gonna (48:09 - 48:13)
Circle back is when you guys were like (48:11 - 48:16)
oh if if people get don't know where to (48:13 - 48:18)
go or if something's too level they they (48:16 - 48:20)
drop off I think where sun and moon (48:18 - 48:23)
failed is that I understood the story (48:20 - 48:26)
you understood the story Greg there's (48:23 - 48:27)
there's other people that even in our (48:26 - 48:29)
YouTube comments we were brought up with (48:27 - 48:31)
Roger they understood the story I mean (48:29 - 48:33)
the story is about parents verbally (48:31 - 48:36)
abusing and or just abusing their kids (48:33 - 48:37)
it was yeah with loose at me it was a (48:36 - 48:40)
gladion it was with Guzman even guzma (48:37 - 48:42)
had his own part (48:40 - 48:44)
but I don't think the dialogue and how (48:42 - 48:49)
the story was told was was well (48:44 - 48:50)
or good (48:49 - 48:53)
um I disagree but I don't think it it (48:50 - 48:55)
was because that's why so many people (48:53 - 48:57)
just gravitate back to black and white (48:55 - 48:59)
of being this amazing story and no one (48:57 - 49:00)
thinks that like sun and moon had like (48:59 - 49:02)
cut scenes too to like set it up and (49:00 - 49:03)
people like oh the cutscenes are too (49:02 - 49:07)
long I think that because (49:03 - 49:11)
the dialogue of the characters in (49:07 - 49:15)
scarlet and violet are so witty and so (49:11 - 49:17)
engaging it makes you actually care (49:15 - 49:19)
about the story and pay attention to it (49:17 - 49:22)
more and you can maybe argue it's a (49:19 - 49:24)
simpler story it is (49:22 - 49:28)
but like (49:24 - 49:28)
it's not that but that's not even saying (49:28 - 49:32)
like sword and shield has more dialogue (49:30 - 49:34)
like I don't think Lily was written (49:32 - 49:35)
pretty I don't think Lily was written (49:34 - 49:37)
really well I don't think gladion was (49:35 - 49:39)
written really well I don't I mean I (49:37 - 49:40)
disagree (49:39 - 49:42)
said what they needed to say to push (49:40 - 49:45)
that story forward but I think they (49:42 - 49:46)
could have said it better I think they (49:45 - 49:47)
could have been more engaging I think (49:46 - 49:50)
they could have been more relatable like (49:47 - 49:53)
there's a there's a part in the school (49:50 - 49:54)
I think we I think we talked about this (49:53 - 49:57)
last week where I didn't care about one (49:54 - 49:59)
of the teachers and a little student (49:57 - 50:01)
comes up while I'm talking to the (49:59 - 50:02)
teacher and was like hey (50:01 - 50:05)
weren't you a gym leader and she said no (50:02 - 50:07)
I don't want to talk about that right (50:05 - 50:09)
now and she's like don't interrupt your (50:07 - 50:11)
classmates that's rude and that little (50:09 - 50:13)
interaction I went from not caring about (50:11 - 50:15)
this teacher and I was like I just want (50:13 - 50:16)
the held item you're holding like get (50:15 - 50:18)
through the dialogue give it to me that (50:16 - 50:21)
interaction was was was good enough or (50:18 - 50:23)
great or however you want to describe it (50:21 - 50:25)
for me to be like I want to know now (50:23 - 50:27)
yeah but that's you that's your personal (50:25 - 50:29)
preference right that's right but what (50:27 - 50:32)
I'm saying is that moment never really (50:29 - 50:35)
existed in sun and moon or other games (50:32 - 50:39)
so many times in scarlet and violet that (50:35 - 50:41)
moment happened to me a ton in Sun and (50:39 - 50:43)
Moon a ton you just didn't connect with (50:41 - 50:46)
it the same way and that's fine I don't (50:43 - 50:48)
think so yeah you don't have listeners (50:46 - 50:51)
it did happen to me like Lily not being (50:48 - 50:53)
able to address herself that whole (50:51 - 50:56)
section is really powerful if you had (50:53 - 50:58)
those kind of parents (50:56 - 51:01)
right like because you didn't have that (50:58 - 51:03)
that didn't grab your attention doesn't (51:01 - 51:05)
mean it wasn't there for people that it (51:03 - 51:06)
did (51:05 - 51:08)
I said they could have done it better (51:06 - 51:10)
and they did do it better in this game I (51:08 - 51:11)
think they did it great I think this one (51:10 - 51:13)
they did they did a good job with it but (51:11 - 51:14)
again (51:13 - 51:16)
you connect to this storyline better (51:14 - 51:18)
than I do (51:16 - 51:20)
yeah that's probably true especially (51:18 - 51:22)
with the two star stuff and the same (51:20 - 51:24)
star stuff good storyline but I (51:22 - 51:27)
I will talk about there but I couldn't (51:24 - 51:29)
be more disconnected from a storyline (51:27 - 51:31)
than that one oh my gosh yeah okay yeah (51:29 - 51:33)
that's fair listeners I hope you've (51:31 - 51:35)
enjoyed this conversation about the (51:33 - 51:38)
Titan storyline (51:35 - 51:38)
a lot about the Titan storyline you are (51:40 - 51:43)
healing (51:42 - 51:46)
a bunch of Pokemon through HMS and you (51:43 - 51:47)
are you are dealing with a very broken (51:46 - 51:49)
person and it's a very personal (51:47 - 51:53)
storyline it's a very good storyline it (51:49 - 51:55)
is a weight it's a good storyline of how (51:53 - 51:58)
to understand a person's pain help them (51:55 - 52:00)
and humanize them right like that's the (51:58 - 52:02)
heart of that story (52:00 - 52:05)
and they do it really well (52:02 - 52:07)
yeah I I enjoyed it from start to finish (52:05 - 52:09)
uh I think (52:07 - 52:11)
the other thing that maybe we didn't (52:09 - 52:13)
talk about is I I don't know about you (52:11 - 52:16)
guys but once I got to the fourth Titan (52:13 - 52:19)
I needed to know the ending like I knew (52:16 - 52:20)
the ending (52:19 - 52:23)
but I needed to know like I I need I I (52:20 - 52:24)
was like I'm skipping everything I'm (52:23 - 52:26)
done with Titan 4. I'm going right to (52:24 - 52:28)
Titan five (52:26 - 52:28)
I guessed the ending I'm like I know (52:29 - 52:33)
what's gonna happen so I can get to it I (52:31 - 52:35)
I I had a pretty good idea of what was (52:33 - 52:37)
going to happen but there was a part of (52:35 - 52:39)
me especially like in the last bit of (52:37 - 52:41)
the fifth Tyson where I was like (52:39 - 52:42)
are they actually going to do a (52:41 - 52:44)
different thing here I was like are they (52:42 - 52:45)
actually going to do what he doesn't (52:44 - 52:47)
recover I was like I don't think so (52:45 - 52:50)
because it's a Pokemon game but I felt (52:47 - 52:52)
like and and I do think that (52:50 - 52:54)
I'm not going to say that would be a (52:52 - 52:55)
better story right because I think it's (52:54 - 52:57)
it's complicated in what you what you're (52:55 - 52:59)
looking it's a very different kind of (52:57 - 53:01)
story right (52:59 - 53:03)
um but I I was I wanted to know what was (53:01 - 53:04)
happening just because I thought that (53:03 - 53:07)
was a possibility at that point yeah I (53:04 - 53:09)
mean I was certainly surprised like (53:07 - 53:11)
Steve and unlike Greg I was surprised (53:09 - 53:13)
when he turned out to actually be a good (53:11 - 53:16)
guy Arvin I was half expecting it to to (53:13 - 53:17)
turn around on me (53:16 - 53:19)
um just because he seemed so suspicious (53:17 - 53:20)
and there was the weirdness around him (53:19 - 53:23)
and the the legendary at the beginning (53:20 - 53:24)
and you're just like I don't understand (53:23 - 53:26)
what's Happening Here you seem a bit (53:24 - 53:29)
suspicious it's a story of healing (53:26 - 53:31)
and there is no way I mean I knew the (53:29 - 53:33)
minute that it was a story about healing (53:31 - 53:36)
that that it was going to go one way (53:33 - 53:37)
like (53:36 - 53:40)
they could have done a story of loss at (53:37 - 53:43)
the very end but that wasn't from the (53:40 - 53:45)
very start that wasn't that wasn't the (53:43 - 53:47)
story they were telling (53:45 - 53:49)
they were telling a healing story and it (53:47 - 53:51)
was it was like (53:49 - 53:54)
neon sign from the first sandwich this (53:51 - 53:56)
is a story about healing and you're (53:54 - 53:58)
going to be you're going to be healing a (53:56 - 54:01)
person through this process (53:58 - 54:04)
yeah I mean uh so cloth gives you (54:01 - 54:07)
sprinting Bombardier gives you surfing (54:04 - 54:10)
oathworm gives you a double jump uh the (54:07 - 54:13)
great Tusk iron Treads gives you flying (54:10 - 54:15)
and then (54:13 - 54:17)
gliding sorry yeah it's definitely not (54:15 - 54:19)
flying which definitely doesn't have so (54:17 - 54:22)
many issues I have so many issues (54:19 - 54:25)
dandozo and tossaguri give you um (54:22 - 54:28)
climbing which is technically I think (54:25 - 54:31)
sneezler was (54:28 - 54:33)
maybe last yeah no yeah (54:31 - 54:35)
yeah I think so yeah flying before (54:33 - 54:37)
sneezler I think yeah you got flying (54:35 - 54:41)
recently gliding I think (54:37 - 54:43)
I think flying was from the temple (54:41 - 54:45)
bravery snowy area no you got yeah Brave (54:43 - 54:47)
here's the last one you got glad yeah (54:45 - 54:49)
nobody series (54:47 - 54:51)
they flipped it this time (54:49 - 54:52)
um I don't think there's nothing really (54:51 - 54:55)
special here about cloth Bombardier or (54:52 - 54:57)
earthworm uh they're just like oath worm (54:55 - 54:58)
you kind of have to chase around a (54:57 - 55:00)
little bit Bombardier you have to like (54:58 - 55:05)
like Dodge some some rocks (55:00 - 55:05)
so I couldn't I spent 20 minutes trying (55:06 - 55:10)
to get it to register that I was in the (55:08 - 55:12)
right area because it would just be like (55:10 - 55:15)
reset I'm like on (55:12 - 55:17)
I do like how they were integrated into (55:15 - 55:19)
the open world nicely (55:17 - 55:21)
um like you you didn't just walk up and (55:19 - 55:22)
like press a button and start the (55:21 - 55:24)
encounter right you walked into the area (55:22 - 55:26)
with cloth you saw it on the wall you (55:24 - 55:28)
walked up up to it and then sure it came (55:26 - 55:30)
into a cut scene at that point but it (55:28 - 55:33)
wasn't just like oh this is the area you (55:30 - 55:34)
have to find the right bit and click a (55:33 - 55:36)
button like I actually felt like you (55:34 - 55:38)
were coming across the Titan in the (55:36 - 55:40)
right place in the way you actually (55:38 - 55:43)
would in a world like that yeah (55:40 - 55:44)
um (55:43 - 55:46)
and the first three yeah there's there's (55:44 - 55:50)
nothing zany happening there uh there's (55:46 - 55:51)
nothing really zany and great (55:50 - 55:53)
tuscariring Treads it's just you know (55:51 - 55:55)
one you get one or the other um and you (55:53 - 55:56)
kind of just chase them through the (55:55 - 55:59)
through the desert uh the false Dragon (55:56 - 56:01)
Titan probably the most interesting one (55:59 - 56:05)
where you see uh a very large tosuguri (56:01 - 56:07)
you interact with it (56:05 - 56:09)
um (56:07 - 56:09)
it was still tiny (56:10 - 56:13)
um dandozo eats it you battle dondozo (56:14 - 56:18)
um (56:17 - 56:22)
and then uh (56:18 - 56:24)
you end up well I can't remember the (56:22 - 56:25)
order of it there was like three fights (56:24 - 56:28)
there wasn't it yeah (56:25 - 56:31)
the first time it runs away yeah it hits (56:28 - 56:34)
the wall you fight donzo the second time (56:31 - 56:38)
yes it faints and spits up tatsuguri and (56:34 - 56:40)
then you fight an empowered tatsuguri (56:38 - 56:43)
yes yeah and that was really that was a (56:40 - 56:46)
like nice twist really clever very fun (56:43 - 56:48)
um probably difficult for people not (56:46 - 56:52)
expecting that third round (56:48 - 56:54)
um but the weakness has changed some (56:52 - 56:56)
this is why I say the Titans is the (56:54 - 56:59)
easiest because it it's it's only one (56:56 - 56:59)
Pokemon (56:59 - 57:03)
and you have six assuming that you (56:59 - 57:06)
brought all six or five or whatever and (57:03 - 57:09)
you have a partner there too yeah so it (57:06 - 57:11)
makes sense that this is also the (57:09 - 57:13)
easiest because it is tied to your (57:11 - 57:15)
Mobility (57:13 - 57:16)
um (57:15 - 57:17)
there's (57:16 - 57:20)
I think Greg said there was a place that (57:17 - 57:21)
he couldn't go or it wasn't really but (57:20 - 57:23)
you can go anywhere there was nowhere I (57:21 - 57:26)
was restricted beside like even with (57:23 - 57:28)
Team star you can go around them yeah it (57:26 - 57:31)
was when I went the problem I was trying (57:28 - 57:35)
to go straight to the Water Gym (57:31 - 57:37)
and the road is blocked off (57:35 - 57:39)
so I was like (57:37 - 57:41)
oh and then it forced me to a cut scene (57:39 - 57:43)
and I'm like I don't I don't want this (57:41 - 57:47)
right now so then I said okay well I (57:43 - 57:48)
have to go around so I jumped off the (57:47 - 57:50)
cliff into the desert and then my phone (57:48 - 57:52)
went off and he's like hey there's a (57:50 - 57:54)
Titan here I'm like would you leave me (57:52 - 57:57)
alone I'm trying to get to a gym (57:54 - 58:00)
stop calling me stop getting in my way (57:57 - 58:02)
just let me go (58:00 - 58:05)
and eventually I got around but like I (58:02 - 58:06)
went into a thing got fortunate with cut (58:05 - 58:08)
scenes like I don't want to do this went (58:06 - 58:10)
off the cliff to get right into another (58:08 - 58:12)
cutscene I think they have to do that (58:10 - 58:14)
though because that's how it it just (58:12 - 58:16)
that's how it decides the the actual (58:14 - 58:19)
cutscene order yeah it does and I get (58:16 - 58:22)
why it happened but I was like open (58:19 - 58:25)
world my butt I mean I'm stopping to (58:22 - 58:27)
give you dialogue is still fine yeah you (58:25 - 58:29)
can you can then you can then just like (58:27 - 58:32)
then go back to where you were before I (58:29 - 58:33)
will say there is one area that you (58:32 - 58:35)
can't get to from the beginning and (58:33 - 58:38)
that's the the islands around the fifth (58:35 - 58:40)
Titan there's no way to get to them (58:38 - 58:44)
without either gliding or surfing yep (58:40 - 58:47)
yes that that is the one area that is (58:44 - 58:50)
restricted that is blocked off (58:47 - 58:50)
you could get to it (58:51 - 58:56)
so yes you would have to do one yeah you (58:54 - 58:58)
don't have to do much to get to it but (58:56 - 59:00)
if you have the issue where you were (58:58 - 59:01)
gliding towards it and the cut scene (59:00 - 59:03)
started and it dropped you into the (59:01 - 59:05)
water yeah there's some bugs in this (59:03 - 59:06)
game (59:05 - 59:09)
I just have an issue with the gliding in (59:06 - 59:10)
general (59:09 - 59:12)
there's like a limited amount of time (59:10 - 59:15)
you can travel like horizontally and (59:12 - 59:18)
then you just suddenly Glide slowly down (59:15 - 59:20)
and I don't understand why they're doing (59:18 - 59:22)
that like it's just is that a bug I feel (59:20 - 59:24)
like it must be about I feel like it (59:22 - 59:27)
would make that decision but yeah it's (59:24 - 59:29)
weird because I'd be like why am I not (59:27 - 59:32)
moving forward yeah just falling what's (59:29 - 59:33)
going on (59:32 - 59:35)
especially going from I think in general (59:33 - 59:38)
as well the the traversal on (59:35 - 59:41)
um in this game is less good than (59:38 - 59:44)
Legends I think the Legends traversal is (59:41 - 59:45)
so good (59:44 - 59:47)
um and like especially with you know (59:45 - 59:50)
weirder you could like try and get to (59:47 - 59:51)
some areas that you weren't really meant (59:50 - 59:53)
to without the I know you can do the (59:51 - 59:55)
backwards jump on your legendary in this (59:53 - 59:57)
game but it that that's like a glitch (59:55 - 59:59)
whereas weirder felt like it was (59:57 - 60:01)
deliberate like you can just kind of get (59:59 - 60:02)
into some areas that you can otherwise (60:01 - 60:05)
not do yeah I think (60:02 - 60:06)
um (60:05 - 60:09)
I made the joke in slack that you know (60:06 - 60:10)
for for the last eight months people are (60:09 - 60:12)
like ah Pokemon Legends was just this (60:10 - 60:15)
big beta slash like testing ground for (60:12 - 60:18)
this game and but it just it's funny (60:15 - 60:19)
because (60:18 - 60:21)
Legends movement just its movement we (60:19 - 60:23)
can ignore everything else but like the (60:21 - 60:26)
movement on weird deer basket Legion (60:23 - 60:30)
sneezler bravery no one cares about (60:26 - 60:32)
ursuluna though those four movement (60:30 - 60:36)
options are so much better than executed (60:32 - 60:38)
better (60:36 - 60:40)
um and I don't mind the Sprint on the (60:38 - 60:42)
the stick for (60:40 - 60:44)
um the car to make it go faster like (60:42 - 60:47)
sprinting it but with weird deer you (60:44 - 60:50)
could wasn't it just you held the B (60:47 - 60:53)
button and then you hit a to jump right (60:50 - 60:55)
it was like one like you held the button (60:53 - 60:57)
down to make weird your Sprint (60:55 - 60:59)
yeah I think he did actually yeah (60:57 - 61:02)
whereas you've got whereas you've got (60:59 - 61:04)
the Boost which is just on or off but I (61:02 - 61:05)
feel like one year which is better (61:04 - 61:07)
boosting you can't jump (61:05 - 61:11)
you can yeah I think you stop boosting (61:07 - 61:12)
because you you can only boost when (61:11 - 61:14)
you're on the ground but you can boost (61:12 - 61:16)
and then jump and you your jump is is (61:14 - 61:18)
faster but I'm almost positive with (61:16 - 61:22)
weird deer you would want to run jump or (61:18 - 61:24)
not run jump and I only know that (61:22 - 61:27)
because of the the balloon minigame they (61:24 - 61:30)
did like yeah the how they spread out (61:27 - 61:31)
the balloons are like oh I want to go (61:30 - 61:32)
this fast or this fast or I want to jump (61:31 - 61:35)
short or I want to jump high yeah but (61:32 - 61:38)
that in itself just taught that just (61:35 - 61:41)
shows how much Mobility that game has (61:38 - 61:42)
compared to this one I don't think (61:41 - 61:46)
basketball Legion moved very well all of (61:42 - 61:48)
the times yeah well you know yeah but (61:46 - 61:51)
the legendary in the water doesn't (61:48 - 61:53)
even worse so there were there were so (61:51 - 61:55)
many issues like if you if you jump in (61:53 - 61:58)
the water and you before it like moves (61:55 - 62:01)
into its bolt mode you like you (61:58 - 62:03)
basically do a drift if you try yeah (62:01 - 62:05)
this is weird (62:03 - 62:08)
dip below the water for like five (62:05 - 62:10)
seconds and just hang out there for yep (62:08 - 62:11)
I'm like well okay cool (62:10 - 62:14)
what's happening folks oh here I go okay (62:11 - 62:16)
so overall we're gonna need to wrap this (62:14 - 62:18)
up (62:16 - 62:18)
did we enjoy the Titan storyline start (62:18 - 62:25)
to finish my answer is yes 100 loved it (62:21 - 62:26)
yeah (62:25 - 62:28)
bear bearing in mind that we haven't (62:26 - 62:30)
actually done the final bit yes yeah (62:28 - 62:32)
without doing the final bit but the (62:30 - 62:35)
first five it's it's a decent storyline (62:32 - 62:37)
cool (62:35 - 62:41)
um yeah I I enjoyed it a whole bunch and (62:37 - 62:42)
uh (62:41 - 62:44)
I'm glad I did it first because the (62:42 - 62:46)
other stories seem to be (62:44 - 62:47)
more (62:46 - 62:51)
more I mean bigger stories I guess more (62:47 - 62:53)
and more (62:51 - 62:56)
yeah slightly bigger (62:53 - 62:59)
it's very obviously more people right I (62:56 - 63:01)
relate to the team star storyline and (62:59 - 63:03)
Greg does not (63:01 - 63:05)
but I think that's why I liked it so (63:03 - 63:06)
much but I think we also when we talk (63:05 - 63:08)
about the gym leaders we talk about we (63:06 - 63:10)
have to talk about how uh the pal day in (63:08 - 63:12)
Pokemon League clearly does not pay (63:10 - 63:15)
their Gym Leaders a livable wage (63:12 - 63:17)
yes yeah when we talk about the gym (63:15 - 63:19)
leaders we also talk about the Elite (63:17 - 63:20)
Four (63:19 - 63:22)
oh I have to do them (63:20 - 63:23)
that's nice it's fine you've got some (63:22 - 63:26)
time Greg you got a week (63:23 - 63:28)
oh you haven't done the Elite Four yet (63:26 - 63:30)
as of this (63:28 - 63:33)
me yeah no no I haven't I think I think (63:30 - 63:35)
we're in the same place Greg basically (63:33 - 63:38)
aren't we doing the eight gyms yeah and (63:35 - 63:40)
I haven't but for all three of them okay (63:38 - 63:41)
so finished all of the internet not done (63:40 - 63:43)
the final bit for each of them the Elite (63:41 - 63:45)
Four is not the final bit there's (63:43 - 63:47)
another bit after the Elite Four (63:45 - 63:49)
so where we are in the titans of like (63:47 - 63:52)
the final bit the Elite Four is still (63:49 - 63:55)
not the final bit so yeah I just haven't (63:52 - 63:57)
I haven't done the Elite Four and that's (63:55 - 63:58)
what because I have one more star left (63:57 - 64:00)
to do so I want to do all of them to get (63:58 - 64:02)
them at the same rough point and then (64:00 - 64:04)
yeah complete them so you'll want to do (64:02 - 64:07)
the Elite Four to then right be there (64:04 - 64:09)
okay I'm just doing a little bit of (64:07 - 64:10)
grinding before I get there because I'm (64:09 - 64:13)
just a wee but under leveled I'm uh I'm (64:10 - 64:16)
a little under leveled oh gosh I have (64:13 - 64:18)
not had a leveling problem in this game (64:16 - 64:22)
I have not been battling any trailers (64:18 - 64:24)
I don't care about them that yeah that's (64:22 - 64:26)
uh that's uh when we get to the levels (64:24 - 64:28)
when we get to I don't know if I'll do (64:26 - 64:31)
that but when we the whole level scaling (64:28 - 64:32)
thing makes me Circle back if there's (64:31 - 64:34)
one thing that should scale it should be (64:32 - 64:37)
trainers well Traders should have more (64:34 - 64:39)
than one Pokemon that's (64:37 - 64:41)
so many I don't mind them having one (64:39 - 64:43)
Pokemon if the Pokemon (64:41 - 64:46)
if they give you experience right yeah (64:43 - 64:48)
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah the the (64:46 - 64:49)
trainers are probably the biggest (64:48 - 64:51)
afterthought this well yeah that's not (64:49 - 64:54)
true accessibility maybe yeah (64:51 - 64:54)
the trainers like again the open world (64:55 - 65:01)
tends to make up for but also gives them (64:58 - 65:03)
excuse of well we can only we only (65:01 - 65:05)
wanted to give them one Pokemon because (65:03 - 65:06)
we didn't know which order you were (65:05 - 65:08)
going to go in and like so many of these (65:06 - 65:10)
trainers only have one Pokemon and I'm (65:08 - 65:14)
like this is dumb yeah yeah and they're (65:10 - 65:17)
uh gosh we have to but like there needs (65:14 - 65:19)
to be like a first Seeker not to (65:17 - 65:20)
rebattle them but to be like there's a (65:19 - 65:22)
trainer like five feet away from me that (65:20 - 65:25)
you haven't battled because like oh like (65:22 - 65:27)
yeah trying to find out because you can (65:25 - 65:29)
go to each area and like talk to that (65:27 - 65:31)
guy that said the Pokemon Sun the a (65:29 - 65:32)
petrol station whatever you want to call (65:31 - 65:35)
it and he's like oh if you get to this (65:32 - 65:37)
level of right people battle I mean yeah (65:35 - 65:39)
thing but then you have to go and find (65:37 - 65:41)
the one that you're right that I know (65:39 - 65:44)
that that is what I haven't done for us (65:41 - 65:46)
because they're speech bubbles above (65:44 - 65:48)
their head when you haven't hit them and (65:46 - 65:49)
when you're done the speech bubble (65:48 - 65:51)
doesn't appear again yes but because (65:49 - 65:53)
because the frame rate so atrocious I (65:51 - 65:54)
don't know that until I'm literally (65:53 - 65:57)
right in front of them well yes because (65:54 - 65:59)
the viewing distance isn't great you (65:57 - 66:02)
literally have to be holding yourself to (65:59 - 66:04)
know that they exist (66:02 - 66:07)
