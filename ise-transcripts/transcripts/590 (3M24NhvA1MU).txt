m it's not bad no 55 is pretty all right (1:15 - 1:21)
55 is pretty good for us uh for being (1:19 - 1:23)
mid (1:21 - 1:26)
November yeah we had a snowstorm (1:23 - 1:28)
randomly and now it's 50 degrees it's (1:26 - 1:31)
random it's October (1:28 - 1:34)
It's s the classic Halloween snowstorm (1:31 - 1:36)
classic but you know it was nothing (1:34 - 1:37)
compared to the Halloween blizzard of (1:36 - 1:39)
1991 so let me tell you (1:37 - 1:42)
[Laughter] (1:39 - 1:42)
about uh speaking of Halloween there was (1:43 - 1:49)
a Pokemon sleep Halloween event which by (1:46 - 1:52)
the time this episode goes up should be (1:49 - 1:56)
over uh but Hannah how was the Pokemon (1:52 - 2:00)
Halloween for the first big I don't know (1:56 - 2:01)
well maybe you could say good sleep day (2:00 - 2:03)
was like the first big event but this (2:01 - 2:04)
was like a week- long event they they (2:03 - 2:07)
updated the decorations the (2:04 - 2:10)
music it's an adorable event but I think (2:07 - 2:12)
I didn't notice the bonuses that much (2:10 - 2:15)
other than just the fact that it's it's (2:12 - 2:17)
goodlooking like they updated the (2:15 - 2:18)
decorations there are Little Pumpkins (2:17 - 2:21)
everywhere the music is fantastic it (2:18 - 2:24)
looks fantastic and they did tell people (2:21 - 2:26)
very visibly to go to Green Grass and (2:24 - 2:28)
not the other Islands thank oh yeah they (2:26 - 2:31)
did I don't know how you missed (2:28 - 2:35)
it oh I saw somebody on Twitter or (2:31 - 2:37)
whatever website you want to call it say (2:35 - 2:39)
they started deleting friends who didn't (2:37 - 2:41)
go to Green Island that week cuz then (2:39 - 2:43)
they realized they weren't playing cuz (2:41 - 2:45)
it would just show the last Island (2:43 - 2:47)
you've been to (2:45 - 2:49)
huh and I was like oh that kind of makes (2:47 - 2:52)
sense rude they they could still be (2:49 - 2:53)
playing they could have just gone to a (2:52 - 2:55)
different (2:53 - 2:58)
Island they could be playing wrong but (2:55 - 2:59)
at that point do you want to be friends (2:58 - 3:00)
with them if if they're that (2:59 - 3:03)
irresponsible with their game play I (3:00 - 3:06)
mean they should sign to go to Green (3:03 - 3:09)
Island I think the bonuses are great I (3:06 - 3:10)
think I probably just haven't noticed (3:09 - 3:12)
them all that much I did use a bunch of (3:10 - 3:14)
the candy to evolve a Pikachu into a (3:12 - 3:16)
Raichu and level it up so it's one of my (3:14 - 3:19)
highest level Pokemon and it is a very (3:16 - 3:22)
very fast Berry gatherer and it is (3:19 - 3:23)
pretty much outspeeding any other (3:22 - 3:26)
Pokemon regardless of whether Snorlax (3:23 - 3:29)
wants its berries or not so that has (3:26 - 3:31)
been great and I'm sure I will (3:29 - 3:33)
appreciate the rest of the candy later (3:31 - 3:36)
on but it's not as noticeable a bonus in (3:33 - 3:39)
the moment I'm still loving the event (3:36 - 3:42)
though yeah yeah I I really liked the (3:39 - 3:45)
decorations I think uh Chris over at the (3:42 - 3:48)
goast podcast got the shiny witch hat (3:45 - 3:53)
Pikachu oh super rare very (3:48 - 3:56)
cool um so if that happened you you can (3:53 - 3:58)
delete the game update your LinkedIn (3:56 - 4:00)
profile you have definitely won (3:58 - 4:03)
um shiny Shuppet though oh yeah shiny (4:00 - 4:04)
Shuppet is pretty cool so Shuppet does (4:03 - 4:06)
Shuppet go away completely when this (4:04 - 4:09)
event is over or I don't I don't think (4:06 - 4:11)
so I'm assuming Pikachu Hat's the only (4:09 - 4:14)
one that's going to go away yeah I was I (4:11 - 4:16)
was a little worried that there was (4:14 - 4:17)
going to be some fomo (4:16 - 4:20)
for witch hat (4:17 - 4:23)
Pikachu but I've gotten like three this (4:20 - 4:27)
week so I get like I wouldn't say one (4:23 - 4:29)
every night but I got on Halloween the (4:27 - 4:32)
day after Halloween and then like a day (4:29 - 4:35)
or two later I got another one so yeah (4:32 - 4:36)
I've gotten them most nights and it only (4:35 - 4:38)
has two sleep Styles so it's easy to (4:36 - 4:41)
complete the deck yeah yeah (4:38 - 4:45)
yeah I I did the thing before for those (4:41 - 4:47)
that were like where's the calculator (4:45 - 4:48)
it's on the last YouTube video it's in (4:47 - 4:51)
the pin comment uh I mean that's that's (4:48 - 4:54)
your mistake all intelligent people do (4:51 - 4:56)
not read YouTube comments because they (4:54 - 4:58)
know they want to keep their sanity you (4:56 - 5:00)
just have to it's just the first what (4:58 - 5:01)
it's pinned it's at the top don't scroll (5:00 - 5:03)
any further no our our YouTube comments (5:01 - 5:07)
are are ra rather good I think I've I've (5:03 - 5:10)
deleted slidden all the bad people so (5:07 - 5:11)
they're just talking to themselves they (5:10 - 5:13)
think they're commenting and they think (5:11 - 5:15)
people are liking well they're liking (5:13 - 5:17)
their own post I've always noticed the (5:15 - 5:19)
people who are like really rude they (5:17 - 5:21)
also like their own post I know you're (5:19 - 5:23)
liking your own post no one else can see (5:21 - 5:25)
it but me and (5:23 - 5:25)
you it's like the worst if you don't (5:26 - 5:30)
support yourself (5:29 - 5:32)
nobody will (5:30 - 5:35)
knowe if you don't love yourself in your (5:32 - 5:38)
comments how is anybody else going to (5:35 - 5:40)
love yourself if you're not hyping up (5:38 - 5:42)
your own comment who else what are you (5:40 - 5:43)
doing your comment should be on your (5:42 - 5:45)
LinkedIn profile next to your shiny (5:43 - 5:49)
count here's what I do on the (5:45 - 5:52)
internet H me all of my Pokemon through (5:49 - 5:55)
the calculator deleted like 20 just so (5:52 - 5:58)
this week I would have been like (5:55 - 6:00)
optimized for catching (5:58 - 6:02)
yep I did something similar I didn't (6:00 - 6:04)
make a spreadsheet but I made very (6:02 - 6:06)
thorough lists so that I had one team (6:04 - 6:09)
for ingredients and one team for berries (6:06 - 6:10)
and I could switch back and forth (6:09 - 6:12)
between them when I need (6:10 - 6:15)
it the most the most complicated of (6:12 - 6:17)
Pokemon games Pokemon (6:15 - 6:21)
sleep uh shifting gears here we do have (6:17 - 6:23)
some scarlet and violet news we have a (6:21 - 6:25)
release date before we get there we have (6:23 - 6:29)
a better release date Pokemon Returns (6:25 - 6:32)
the Thanksgiving Day (6:29 - 6:36)
Parade yeah surprise surprise Pikachu (6:32 - 6:40)
and Eevee to soar you got you got to (6:36 - 6:42)
remember Eevee is a very popular (6:40 - 6:45)
Pokemon uh Pikachu and Eevee to soar (6:42 - 6:48)
once again uh for the 23rd consecutive (6:45 - 6:51)
year which is actually kind of crazy to (6:48 - 6:53)
think about the Pokemon company (6:51 - 6:54)
International will kick off this holiday (6:53 - 6:56)
with the return of the Macy's (6:54 - 6:58)
Thanksgiving Day Parade on Thursday (6:56 - 7:01)
November 23rd in New New York City fans (6:58 - 7:02)
will be able to watch Pikachu and Eevee (7:01 - 7:05)
sore through Manhattan on a Pokeball (7:02 - 7:08)
inspired sled which is this balloon is (7:05 - 7:10)
relatively new right they they did this (7:08 - 7:13)
balloon closer to let's go Pikachu let's (7:10 - 7:17)
go Eevee I think yeah (7:13 - 7:17)
um and then they just talk about the (7:17 - 7:24)
Macy's parade and then they talk about (7:21 - 7:26)
everything that's coming later this year (7:24 - 7:28)
all right here here's my pop quiz Hot (7:26 - 7:30)
Shots (7:28 - 7:37)
what is the minimum cost the lowest (7:30 - 7:41)
cost to make one of those (7:37 - 7:44)
balloons just to fill to fill is is is (7:41 - 7:48)
this uh prices right style yeah filling (7:44 - 7:51)
every balloon costs a minimum of how (7:48 - 7:54)
much (7:51 - 7:54)
money I'm going to say (7:54 - 8:01)
$80,000 (7:58 - 8:03)
I think I've seen this stat before I do (8:01 - 8:07)
not remember I'm going to go higher and (8:03 - 8:08)
say (8:07 - 8:11)
150,000 she said 8 880,000 and one you (8:08 - 8:13)
messed up the prices right well doesn't (8:11 - 8:15)
matter because if we're going by prices (8:13 - 8:17)
right real had WIS filling every balloon (8:15 - 8:22)
costs a minimum of (8:17 - 8:22)
$510,000 why is it it's why does it cost (8:23 - 8:28)
so much you're putting helium in big (8:25 - 8:31)
they're really big (8:28 - 8:33)
making sponsoring okay here's the second (8:31 - 8:35)
part let's see see if you can pull it (8:33 - 8:37)
out companies sponsoring brand new (8:35 - 8:39)
balloons play a construction and parade (8:37 - 8:42)
feed of how much so construction and (8:39 - 8:47)
parade fee for a new balloon is how much (8:42 - 8:47)
$250,000 construction and parade that's (8:48 - 8:55)
a bunch of employees for the day and for (8:51 - 8:57)
the construction they're getting paid (8:55 - 9:00)
minimum wage to walk that balloon (8:57 - 9:03)
I'm gonna guess a (9:00 - 9:06)
million companies sponsoring brand new (9:03 - 9:08)
balloons pay a construction and parade (9:06 - 9:10)
feed of (9:08 - 9:13)
$190,000 you were both over I the show (9:10 - 9:16)
Price is Right we should $1 Bob I get (9:13 - 9:20)
the car I get the vacation to Tahiti it (9:16 - 9:23)
all goes to me you get the washer and (9:20 - 9:25)
dry I get the washer and dryer I get the (9:23 - 9:28)
set of golf (9:25 - 9:30)
clubs whatever else they putting on (9:28 - 9:32)
their now this why we need we need we (9:30 - 9:33)
need other Bob what are they putting on (9:32 - 9:35)
the prices right no we could ask other (9:33 - 9:38)
Bob Bob other Bob knows oh other Bob (9:35 - 9:40)
would know yeah we gotta get Bob on (9:38 - 9:41)
budget we gotta get budget Bob on budget (9:40 - 9:44)
Bob knows all of the game shows which if (9:41 - 9:46)
you ever visit budgeter Bob stream you (9:44 - 9:49)
can set off all the game show noises (9:46 - 9:52)
yeah yeah yeah yeah here I I'm Cur okay (9:49 - 9:54)
so I have two questions Greg you (9:52 - 9:57)
probably might know this number one is (9:54 - 9:59)
is the Macy Thanksgiving Day Parade a (9:57 - 10:02)
nightmare to attend like the New Year's (9:59 - 10:05)
Eve ball (10:02 - 10:05)
drop crowd wise yeah absolutely like (10:06 - 10:11)
because I've always heard like if you go (10:10 - 10:13)
to New Year's Eve there's no (10:11 - 10:16)
bathrooms no you're just you're just (10:13 - 10:20)
there for like 20 hours to and that (10:16 - 10:22)
sounds like a nightmare second question (10:20 - 10:25)
is do does Japan did anyone tell Japan (10:22 - 10:27)
about this does Japan care about the (10:25 - 10:29)
Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade cares (10:27 - 10:32)
about the ma Thanksgiving Day Parade (10:29 - 10:35)
except for every New Yorker and some (10:32 - 10:37)
segments of the population in all of (10:35 - 10:39)
America I don't think it's broadcast (10:37 - 10:40)
anywhere (10:39 - 10:43)
else um so you got to imagine like New (10:40 - 10:49)
Year's is a long party and everything (10:43 - 10:49)
closes the nacy parade is a long parade (10:50 - 10:56)
that starts at 8:00 a.m. and ends at (10:54 - 11:00)
11:00 p.m. also everything's closed (10:56 - 11:03)
so there are probably porta potties (11:00 - 11:06)
somewhere it's not any of the businesses (11:03 - 11:07)
they're closed for (11:06 - 11:10)
Thanksgiving it's also generally (11:07 - 11:13)
cold um the (11:10 - 11:16)
only the only bonus that I know of that (11:13 - 11:18)
exists for the parade is the parade (11:16 - 11:21)
route's pretty long so the crowd is (11:18 - 11:24)
spread out more instead of all in Time (11:21 - 11:29)
Square mhm um but it's a it's a it's a (11:24 - 11:30)
parade (11:29 - 11:31)
does anybody really like going to (11:30 - 11:35)
parades the answer is no no I've never (11:31 - 11:37)
been a parade guy everybody everybody (11:35 - 11:40)
likes when their friend is in a parade (11:37 - 11:41)
and they're like here comes a friend (11:40 - 11:46)
hooray okay when when can we go (11:41 - 11:46)
let's the other part that I like about (11:47 - 11:51)
the Macy's Parade is when they make the (11:49 - 11:56)
poor shows on Broadway perform a song in (11:51 - 11:58)
the cold on the street and it's always (11:56 - 12:01)
terribly lips synced and sometimes it's (11:58 - 12:04)
just a hot nightmare but occasionally (12:01 - 12:07)
it's really good or it's really bad (12:04 - 12:10)
which is also really (12:07 - 12:10)
good I I just like the live aspect of (12:11 - 12:18)
like something could go wrong (12:14 - 12:22)
yes that's one way to think like what if (12:18 - 12:24)
what if a balloon (12:22 - 12:26)
pops you know what what what if what if (12:24 - 12:31)
a person like falls off their float (12:26 - 12:31)
I just like the Pikachu I've always (12:32 - 12:36)
looked forward to the Pikachu I'm just (12:34 - 12:38)
making up scenarios now here's your (12:36 - 12:40)
chance at Redemption I've looked at the (12:38 - 12:43)
Macy's Thanksgiving Day lineup how many (12:40 - 12:46)
clown crews are there going to be how (12:43 - 12:49)
many crws of (12:46 - 12:51)
clowns are we still is that still a (12:49 - 12:53)
thing it is still a thing there are (12:51 - 12:54)

clowns six six different clown (12:54 - 13:00)

Thanksgiving Parade all right let's move (13:42 - 13:46)
on (13:44 - 13:49)
okay let's move on to the biggest news (13:46 - 13:54)
of the week slony year with the most (13:49 - 13:57)
lackluster way to announce (13:54 - 14:00)
ever which is the the release date to (13:57 - 14:03)
the Pokemon scarlet and violet indigo (14:00 - 14:09)
disc DLC which is arriving on December (14:03 - 14:12)
14th so ironically last week we were (14:09 - 14:14)
like I wonder if they'll announce (14:12 - 14:16)
something this week they sure did and (14:14 - 14:18)
they sure did in the most boring way (14:16 - 14:22)
zero Fanfare no trailer (14:18 - 14:25)
no maybe they emailed us I don't know (14:22 - 14:28)
sometimes there was an email afterwards (14:25 - 14:31)
it time at least to get to me I they had (14:28 - 14:35)
a graphic they have a Graphic it doesn't (14:31 - 14:37)
look it looks like the same graphic I (14:35 - 14:40)
don't know also why there's no no (14:37 - 14:44)
trailer no trailer none no trailer (14:40 - 14:47)
nothing new not even like a wink wink (14:44 - 14:49)
here's a shadow of something (14:47 - 14:54)
cool even blizzard did a 45C trailer for (14:49 - 14:56)
Diablo to say that this expansion isn't (14:54 - 15:00)
coming out for a full year (14:56 - 15:02)
well blizzard needs to do something to (15:00 - 15:03)
get people back on their (15:02 - 15:07)
side this was here's a tweet here's an (15:03 - 15:11)
Instagram post here's an email it's (15:07 - 15:14)
coming again this is this (15:11 - 15:17)
is the to the like five people out there (15:14 - 15:19)
that are arguing that these games were (15:17 - 15:21)
not delayed you're wrong it's fine (15:19 - 15:22)
there's not a single company that (15:21 - 15:24)
doesn't want their stuff to come out (15:22 - 15:27)
before Black Friday uh I I get that (15:24 - 15:29)
there might be like we don't want this (15:27 - 15:30)
to (15:29 - 15:34)
overshadow the fact that Friday was when (15:30 - 15:37)
the physical version came out which was (15:34 - 15:38)
literally yesterday we're recording this (15:37 - 15:40)
on a (15:38 - 15:44)
Saturday but I I I I can't think of that (15:40 - 15:45)
is such (15:44 - 15:49)
a not huge problem I think but I can't (15:45 - 15:53)
think have they met the Pokemon company (15:49 - 15:58)
who schedules 50 things on the same (15:53 - 16:01)
weekend yeah I I just (15:58 - 16:05)
like why why would you not in a business (16:01 - 16:10)
aspect do a trailer or something to then (16:05 - 16:12)
also say like here's the DLC also you (16:10 - 16:15)
can pick up the double pack now yeah (16:12 - 16:17)
like (16:15 - 16:20)
yeah what is (16:17 - 16:22)
happening what happened in this (16:20 - 16:24)
situation (16:22 - 16:26)
where this was how they were going to (16:24 - 16:29)
announce like I don't need new stuff I (16:26 - 16:31)
think a lot of people would argue didn't (16:29 - 16:32)
need to see anything (16:31 - 16:35)
new uh like the surprise cool hold your (16:32 - 16:38)
surprises maybe there's nothing to (16:35 - 16:40)
show maybe they already showed (16:38 - 16:44)
everything they needed to show (16:40 - 16:47)
um maybe they have something against (16:44 - 16:49)
advertising a part of the game that's (16:47 - 16:51)
not going to be in the cartridge they (16:49 - 16:52)
have on (16:51 - 16:55)
shelves yeah (16:52 - 16:58)
yet yeah if you need any sign of this (16:55 - 17:00)
game was delayed it's the fact that this (16:58 - 17:02)
cartridge does not come with the second (17:00 - 17:08)
part of the game yep yep yep (17:02 - 17:12)
mhm it's uh like I think people are (17:08 - 17:16)
excited I think you know it it it's fine (17:12 - 17:18)
for the 14th of December they're getting (17:16 - 17:20)
out before look if you if your if your (17:18 - 17:22)
main goal as a business is to get out (17:20 - 17:25)
before Black Friday your and you can't (17:22 - 17:27)
hit that your second main goal is to (17:25 - 17:30)
please get this out before Christmas (17:27 - 17:33)
get it up for gift giving season and (17:30 - 17:36)
they're doing that so Christmas is on a (17:33 - 17:40)
Monday this year uh yeah so this would (17:36 - 17:43)
be the last realistic (17:40 - 17:46)
Friday Thursday Thursday before (17:43 - 17:48)
Christmas I mean I guess you could argue (17:46 - 17:53)
the 21st but you don't want your parents (17:48 - 17:56)
and or to go out that weekend they are (17:53 - 17:59)
making it on the second until last night (17:56 - 18:01)
of (17:59 - 18:01)
Hanukkah thank goodness they got it in (18:02 - 18:06)
there right in the right when the gifts (18:05 - 18:08)
are supposed to start getting good in (18:06 - 18:09)
Hanukkah the last two (18:08 - 18:13)
days there you go (18:09 - 18:15)
um but yeah I we there's nothing else to (18:13 - 18:18)
say that they literally just give a date (18:15 - 18:21)
they said nothing else so there's not (18:18 - 18:26)
much more there it's uh hey did you know (18:21 - 18:28)
that we're going to release this on the (18:26 - 18:29)
14 (18:28 - 18:33)
do you want more than that too (18:29 - 18:33)
bad uh yeah so (18:33 - 18:40)
um just says the story continues as (18:37 - 18:42)
you're an exchange student that visits (18:40 - 18:45)
blueberry Academy most of the most of (18:42 - 18:47)
this unusual School is located in under (18:45 - 18:49)
the (18:47 - 18:52)
ocean uh its curriculum emphasizes on (18:49 - 18:55)
Pokemon battling the Indigo disc arrives (18:52 - 18:58)
December 14th oh you know what is the (18:55 - 18:59)
the (18:58 - 19:02)
the news uh I guess is maybe people (18:59 - 19:04)
don't know this a lot of people who (19:02 - 19:07)
listen to this podcast probably do um (19:04 - 19:11)
but this DLC requires you to beat the (19:07 - 19:14)
main story of scarlet and violet uh this (19:11 - 19:17)
is very similar to the crown Tundra (19:14 - 19:19)
where you could start the crown Tundra (19:17 - 19:21)
you could do Dynamax Adventure you could (19:19 - 19:24)
meet PE I think his name was and you (19:21 - 19:26)
could meet callar Rex and then after (19:24 - 19:29)
that it like stopped (19:26 - 19:32)
because they wanted you to I think you (19:29 - 19:35)
could get look the crown Thunder story (19:32 - 19:37)
is incredibly short well it's like three (19:35 - 19:40)
little stories it's the callar the birds (19:37 - 19:41)
and then (19:40 - 19:44)
the the CIO story line spoiler kio's in (19:41 - 19:46)
the crown tunder if you didn't know (19:44 - 19:47)
people still don't know this it's (19:46 - 19:49)
actually shocking to me how many people (19:47 - 19:52)
I blow on a daily mind basis that CIO is (19:49 - 19:57)
in the the DLC for sword and shield um (19:52 - 20:00)
but like you can't catch calorex SL (19:57 - 20:05)
Grier Spectre without beating Leon so (20:00 - 20:07)
because the Indigo disc should be the (20:05 - 20:08)
final (20:07 - 20:13)
chapter of what area zero is you need to (20:08 - 20:18)
do the area zero story line which is the (20:13 - 20:22)
final part of the story line so you need (20:18 - 20:26)
to finish the Avery stuff you need to (20:22 - 20:28)
finish the team star stuff you need to (20:26 - 20:32)
be beat the Elite 4 or technically (20:28 - 20:36)
the yeah it's not an Elite 4 It's Like A (20:32 - 20:39)
Champion quiz or whatever the real elite (20:36 - 20:42)
four is in this Indigo disc then you got (20:39 - 20:44)
to go to area (20:42 - 20:45)
zero and then you got to do the (20:44 - 20:49)
professor stuff and then when you get Ed (20:45 - 20:52)
sheer in to finally appear ah yes when (20:49 - 20:57)
you hear the Ed you know you've (20:52 - 20:57)
completed you know that you are ready (20:57 - 21:03)
for Indigo disc you do not need (21:00 - 21:07)
to I I don't think you need to (21:03 - 21:10)
beat teal mask I didn't see anything (21:07 - 21:13)
about that the only thing I saw is not (21:10 - 21:16)
you feel like you probably should need (21:13 - 21:19)
to I haven't seen anything saying it but (21:16 - 21:20)
yeah the only thing I saw is you (21:19 - 21:22)
definitely needed to do base game (21:20 - 21:24)
scarlet and pilot technically for Crown (21:22 - 21:25)
Tundra you didn't have to do any aisle (21:24 - 21:27)
of armor but those were different (21:25 - 21:30)
stories yeah very story heavy and I (21:27 - 21:31)
can't imagine them continuing the (21:30 - 21:34)
siblings story without someone playing (21:31 - 21:36)
the first DLC (21:34 - 21:42)
first Yeah well yeah I mean I'd be it if (21:36 - 21:45)
I'd be in it if the those kids just were (21:42 - 21:47)
like ah side note just like hey there's (21:45 - 21:49)
some cranky kids over here don't worry (21:47 - 21:52)
about them we're important as anyone (21:49 - 21:54)
who's ever played a video game I'm sure (21:52 - 21:57)
you could get the (21:54 - 21:57)
gist yeah but then you have to go and (21:57 - 22:01)
play the first DLC second and that's not (21:59 - 22:03)
going to end well yeah but that could be (22:01 - 22:06)
like a Star Wars thing right cuz like (22:03 - 22:09)
with the you learn you you learn about (22:06 - 22:13)
how Darth Vader became Darth Vader right (22:09 - 22:15)
only if you watch them in the wrong (22:13 - 22:17)
order right right right that's what I'm (22:15 - 22:19)
saying cuz most people did number four (22:17 - 22:22)
five six and then you do one two maybe (22:19 - 22:25)
maybe this is all just a Star Wars (22:22 - 22:27)
thing I am I am not I am not getting (22:25 - 22:29)
into this cover (22:27 - 22:31)
yall get mad at me so what I'm saying (22:29 - 22:34)
spoiler for the teal mask Kieran has The (22:31 - 22:38)
High Ground no the K does does not have (22:34 - 22:40)
The High Ground Kieran has the low (22:38 - 22:43)
ground and he hates you we get to (22:40 - 22:49)
scream I believed in you I I trusted you (22:43 - 22:53)
and then you leave his burning corpse on (22:49 - 22:54)
the side of a (22:53 - 22:56)
macargo this is how I want that game to (22:54 - 23:00)
go this makes the story way better this (22:56 - 23:04)
is what I need for this story to go this (23:00 - 23:07)
is so you're saying you are sold on this (23:04 - 23:09)
story if Kier more sold on the story if (23:07 - 23:13)
I can feed him to the (23:09 - 23:16)
macargo Maro is in the DLC Greg it's all (23:13 - 23:20)
making sense it all it's all coming (23:16 - 23:20)
together okay all right well into the (23:21 - 23:29)
volcano biome with you baby ah (23:24 - 23:31)
exciting nonetheless hey they said they (23:29 - 23:33)
said winter of (23:31 - 23:37)
2023 and by gum they did it they they (23:33 - 23:40)
did it they sure did (23:37 - 23:44)
um so we we have figured out in the last (23:40 - 23:48)
couple years that winter spring summer (23:44 - 23:50)
these are these they they they have no (23:48 - 23:53)
Rhyme or Reason to the actual when (23:50 - 23:55)
seasons start and end they're just (23:53 - 23:58)
they're just time frames they're (23:55 - 24:03)
different definitions of them of (23:58 - 24:03)
Seasons Seasons you want them to be how (24:04 - 24:11)
do you feel about (24:07 - 24:11)
them uh the other bit of scarlet and (24:11 - 24:16)
violet news is tyion came out it was a (24:13 - 24:19)
fire type Terra (24:16 - 24:23)
tyion uh it had sunny day which the (24:19 - 24:27)
original tyion had (24:23 - 24:30)
um and it had willowwisp it had infernal (24:27 - 24:33)
parade which was the signature move um (24:30 - 24:35)
so it having willowwisp also made sense (24:33 - 24:36)
because infernal parade doubles if (24:35 - 24:38)
you're burned infernal parade can burn (24:36 - 24:41)
you Willows can burn you it had (24:38 - 24:42)
flamethrower and then it had for (24:41 - 24:44)
whatever well I shouldn't say why did it (24:42 - 24:46)
have Focus (24:44 - 24:50)
Blast huion has like four special type (24:46 - 24:51)
moves they literally gave it every (24:50 - 24:53)
special type move it had and then the (24:51 - 24:56)
rest of the moves the the wild chart (24:53 - 24:58)
well I guess solar beam but M charge (24:56 - 25:01)
play rough earthquake rock slide all of (24:58 - 25:03)
these physical type moves that actually (25:01 - 25:06)
gave it proper coverage they gave it (25:03 - 25:09)
none which is crazy cu the first one had (25:06 - 25:11)
earthquake and play rough which was (25:09 - 25:14)
really good coverage (25:11 - 25:16)
um (25:14 - 25:22)
but I actually didn't like this raid uh (25:16 - 25:23)
and I (25:22 - 25:26)
think it's not because it was like too (25:23 - 25:28)
easy or because I don't like tyion (25:26 - 25:31)
although tyion is not one of my favorite (25:28 - 25:33)
tyion is not on the top five for (25:31 - 25:34)
starters for (25:33 - 25:38)
me I feel like this raid had (25:34 - 25:42)
like the dumb AI button (25:38 - 25:45)
hit and I be when you give a when you (25:42 - 25:48)
don't give a Pokemon a variety of (25:45 - 25:51)
moves it it does feel like the illusion (25:48 - 25:54)
is not that the the the illusion is (25:51 - 25:56)
broken um so the interesting thing that (25:54 - 25:59)
I don't think any other raid did is tyan (25:56 - 26:01)
would change how it opened up depending (25:59 - 26:06)
if it hit or miss willowwisp so if it (26:01 - 26:08)
and this is part of why I didn't like it (26:06 - 26:11)
when it opened up with willowwisp it (26:08 - 26:15)
only targeted one Pokemon and Willows (26:11 - 26:17)
was (26:15 - 26:18)
85% (26:17 - 26:22)
and if it misses it didn't set sunny day (26:18 - 26:25)
and it would then set sunny day on turn (26:22 - 26:28)
two but if it hit it would set sunny day (26:25 - 26:30)
on turn zero before you got an (26:28 - 26:33)
opportunity to do anything and I think (26:30 - 26:35)
that's kind of (26:33 - 26:37)
cool to like oh it does a different (26:35 - 26:40)
opener if it doesn't hit this move I do (26:37 - 26:41)
think it was weird that it didn't just (26:40 - 26:44)
willowisp everyone on turn zero like (26:41 - 26:46)
yeah I thought that was (26:44 - 26:49)
weird uh cuz if it was like oh there's (26:46 - 26:51)
three iron hands standing next to me it (26:49 - 26:53)
sucks if they would get willowwisp and (26:51 - 26:55)
it was like oh he just picked the Kyogre (26:53 - 26:58)
like that doesn't matter for Kyogre (26:55 - 27:02)
yeah um and of course (26:58 - 27:05)
like raid bosses would pick the (27:02 - 27:07)
strongest move that's like a very common (27:05 - 27:10)
thing so raid bosses will have like (27:07 - 27:12)
programmed moves right like maybe on (27:10 - 27:15)
turn five no matter what the Pikachu is (27:12 - 27:18)
going to surf um it's just like quote (27:15 - 27:20)
unquote programmed in but otherwise (27:18 - 27:21)
between that it's going to do the move (27:20 - 27:24)
that it thinks is best or it might do a (27:21 - 27:25)
random move but there are like (27:24 - 27:27)
programmed moves and then like what move (27:25 - 27:29)
is best against the Pokemon you brought (27:27 - 27:31)
so I remember against Greninja I I (27:29 - 27:33)
brought Hy Dragon I was like oh you know (27:31 - 27:35)
hyd dragon's like weak to ice but it's (27:33 - 27:37)
okay CU hydragon gets snarl so you just (27:35 - 27:40)
snarl twice and then you're good like (27:37 - 27:41)
you're good for you know until he resets (27:40 - 27:43)
his own stats and then you just snarl (27:41 - 27:47)
twice again and you're good um and (27:43 - 27:49)
because hydragon is weak to Ice Beam it (27:47 - 27:51)
was like I'm going to spam ice beam and (27:49 - 27:54)
not any other move cuz Ice Beam is the (27:51 - 27:56)
super the super (27:54 - 27:59)
effective for (27:56 - 28:03)
tyan it was (27:59 - 28:03)
like if you had flash fire or you had (28:04 - 28:11)
something like well- baked body it would (28:08 - 28:16)
still want to do that yeah and like I (28:11 - 28:17)
get it (28:16 - 28:21)
like but but at a certain point it's not (28:17 - 28:21)
working so why the AI should be smart (28:22 - 28:28)
enough to change that like I can totally (28:25 - 28:30)
understand the AI being like I'm G to (28:28 - 28:32)
Willis be you oh you have Flashfire like (28:30 - 28:36)
something in the AI goes don't do a fire (28:32 - 28:39)
type move to this player again because (28:36 - 28:41)
it doesn't work unless I nullify (28:39 - 28:43)
abilities and I feel like there are (28:41 - 28:46)
situations in Pokemon where like the AI (28:43 - 28:49)
is like I'm not going to do we know that (28:46 - 28:51)
AI can do that because there's so many (28:49 - 28:54)
fanmade games where they program it in I (28:51 - 28:58)
don't if anything should adapt to the (28:54 - 29:00)
Pokemon you actually bring it should be (28:58 - 29:03)
seven star raid bosses now I don't think (29:00 - 29:06)
that the raid suddenly becomes harder (29:03 - 29:08)
because the computer switched to (29:06 - 29:10)
infernal parade (29:08 - 29:14)
over flamethrower that doesn't do (29:10 - 29:16)
anything cuz you just probably have to (29:14 - 29:18)
squeeze in a couple more heel cheers but (29:16 - 29:20)
the the but the Seven Star raid boss (29:18 - 29:23)
should take that into (29:20 - 29:26)
account um I only did (29:23 - 29:29)
one one (29:26 - 29:31)
yeah I did one that I did one with (29:29 - 29:34)
randoms um (29:31 - 29:37)
and I mean we had we had a (29:34 - 29:40)
Vaporeon I had Kroger there was another (29:37 - 29:44)
Kroger and there was a a dash Bund and I (29:40 - 29:47)
knew when I saw that the dash Bund was (29:44 - 29:50)
like the solo build of body slam so I'm (29:47 - 29:52)
like well all I need to do is keep this (29:50 - 29:54)
thing alive and I literally don't have (29:52 - 29:56)
to do anything else and that is what I (29:54 - 29:58)
did um (29:56 - 30:01)
and it (29:58 - 30:01)
it it did like a it did the willowwisp (30:02 - 30:07)
to (30:06 - 30:10)
Vaporeon and then set sunny day and then (30:07 - 30:11)
I immediately rain danced and then it (30:10 - 30:14)
was like okay now I'm just keep spamming (30:11 - 30:15)
willowwisp because it did a whole round (30:14 - 30:18)
of willowwisp after that while we were (30:15 - 30:21)
just going Hog (30:18 - 30:24)
Wild then it reset its stats but it took (30:21 - 30:26)
a very long time before it threw its (30:24 - 30:28)
Shield up we were (30:26 - 30:31)
we were many moves in before that Shield (30:28 - 30:34)
went up which felt longer like I don't (30:31 - 30:37)
know yeah the shield was much later in (30:34 - 30:40)
this in this phase it felt way later and (30:37 - 30:42)
then once the shield was up it was like (30:40 - 30:46)
well we've already set up a lot and (30:42 - 30:50)
we've already done a lot of damage so I (30:46 - 30:52)
think I kept everybody alive and then at (30:50 - 30:55)
one point everybody except me died and (30:52 - 30:59)
then we all came back but at that point (30:55 - 31:01)
it had sort of lost momentum and it was (30:59 - 31:04)
just doing infernal randoms were D crazy (31:01 - 31:06)
I've never yeah uh and then at that (31:04 - 31:08)
point I was like well as long as the (31:06 - 31:11)
dash button just keeps going Hog Wild (31:08 - 31:13)
over there we we're just going to be (31:11 - 31:15)
done because the other two aren't doing (31:13 - 31:19)
anything uh yeah it just went and I I (31:15 - 31:23)
didn't think it didn't feel as (31:19 - 31:26)
smart as the other ones which I don't (31:23 - 31:29)
hate I guess (31:26 - 31:31)
like maybe sometimes it's nice just to (31:29 - 31:33)
have an easy one where people are like (31:31 - 31:36)
okay whatever like that was quick and (31:33 - 31:39)
easy and we're we're in and out um but I (31:36 - 31:41)
did think it was (31:39 - 31:45)
less it felt less of of an event this (31:41 - 31:47)
time than it has in the previous where (31:45 - 31:49)
there was a lot more but while I was (31:47 - 31:52)
raising my Kroger I did get two shiny (31:49 - 31:55)
sneel and a shiny Psyduck For No Good (31:52 - 31:59)
Reason oh nice I boy and a girl I'm like (31:55 - 32:01)
why are you here I don't even want to (31:59 - 32:03)
see you and I'm not prepped to (32:01 - 32:06)
even attack you but the other here the (32:03 - 32:07)
other Reas I saw they are such a (32:06 - 32:09)
different color that is the only way (32:07 - 32:11)
there could have been more in that dark (32:09 - 32:13)
cave I was in handheld mold while I was (32:11 - 32:15)
watching Dr Who I don't know but they (32:13 - 32:17)
are hot pink and I'm like hey that's I (32:15 - 32:20)
know that's different and I also know (32:17 - 32:23)
Psyduck is not supposed to be blue those (32:20 - 32:24)
I'm like I know those two things for (32:23 - 32:29)
sure the rest that side was sick yeah (32:24 - 32:30)
he's just you know a little under the (32:29 - 32:32)
weather little (32:30 - 32:34)
fella I was trying to find ckit so I (32:32 - 32:36)
could get chilling Waters it didn't have (32:34 - 32:37)
any cerskus (32:36 - 32:40)
syrup ah yeah for the the earthquake it (32:37 - 32:43)
didn't end up having (32:40 - 32:48)
yeah thanks I felt like I I also wasn't (32:43 - 32:50)
angry at the fact that it was kind of an (32:48 - 32:54)
easier or less less intelligent raid uh (32:50 - 32:58)
less reactive raid but (32:54 - 33:01)
I don't know I it it mostly just felt (32:58 - 33:03)
less intense I didn't need to pay as (33:01 - 33:06)
much attention to it kind of just played (33:03 - 33:10)
through every time uh didn't win every (33:06 - 33:12)
time because randoms are (33:10 - 33:15)
still they're still exciting did you not (33:12 - 33:19)
have a Gade that was holding silk scarf (33:15 - 33:21)
and opened up with Thunder Wave and you (33:19 - 33:23)
just thought to yourself oh this is your (33:21 - 33:25)
FAL swiping (33:23 - 33:27)
Gade because why else would you have (33:25 - 33:29)
silk scarf and Thunder Wave you (33:27 - 33:31)
definitely have full swipe thank (33:29 - 33:34)
goodness you didn't use that but you (33:31 - 33:36)
also died three times um you have to get (33:34 - 33:39)
to one hit point to be able to catch it (33:36 - 33:42)
even in raids everybody knows yeah yeah (33:39 - 33:45)
I I I went to like obviously go over to (33:42 - 33:47)
this is still a problem I went to go (33:45 - 33:49)
over to like join somebody's raid and I (33:47 - 33:51)
accidentally clicked on the the random (33:49 - 33:54)
button and then proceeded to I cannot do (33:51 - 33:58)
anything I cannot get out of it (33:54 - 34:02)
three solid minutes of searching and you (33:58 - 34:05)
cannot abort you cannot you cannot leave (34:02 - 34:07)
there's noort there's no you could turn (34:05 - 34:11)
your switch off just power it all down (34:07 - 34:12)
so of course of course after the 3 (34:11 - 34:15)
minutes it shows like you know Dash bun (34:12 - 34:17)
Gade what was the last one it was like a (34:15 - 34:19)
I think it was like back scalibur or (34:17 - 34:22)
something um and my chat was like do it (34:19 - 34:24)
do it you got to do it and I was like I (34:22 - 34:27)
was like okay we'll we'll see and it was (34:24 - 34:29)
um that back Tali is a good choice (34:27 - 34:32)
though it no it was not a back Calibur I (34:29 - 34:35)
can't remember what it was it was it was (34:32 - 34:37)
some sort of dragon Pokemon but it was (34:35 - 34:40)
holding never melt ice and I was like oh (34:37 - 34:43)
this this doesn't do anything (34:40 - 34:47)
against why do you have this item on um (34:43 - 34:50)
but the the Glade was holding a silk (34:47 - 34:55)
scarf um we lost that raid what I I (34:50 - 34:58)
don't believe you I want to see the (34:55 - 35:01)
it was it was it was wild the the Doh (34:58 - 35:04)
button proceeded to body slam or body (35:01 - 35:07)
press and then and then just die all all (35:04 - 35:09)
the dashb had to do was at what just hit (35:07 - 35:13)
a heel cheer and it would have been (35:09 - 35:17)
fine yeah I I think normally I see other (35:13 - 35:19)
people doing the other cheers nobody in (35:17 - 35:20)
that raid did a cheer except for me it (35:19 - 35:22)
did he cheer twice and that the Glade (35:20 - 35:24)
the I heel cheered the I heel cheered (35:22 - 35:26)
twice I think the Glade heel cheered (35:24 - 35:27)
once (35:26 - 35:29)
whatever that last Pokemon was here (35:27 - 35:31)
here's why I will never do solo (35:29 - 35:34)
builds because you see them in group (35:31 - 35:37)
play and they're the most selfish builds (35:34 - 35:40)
ever they help no one there's not a (35:37 - 35:44)
single move on that entire T like play (35:40 - 35:46)
like if I was to do like the dosh bun (35:44 - 35:49)
solo build or whatever I would put snarl (35:46 - 35:51)
on it I would say you open with one (35:49 - 35:55)
snarl you help the entire team you help (35:51 - 35:59)
yourself because a (35:55 - 35:59)
ne1 (35:59 - 36:05)
uh tyion does significantly less (36:01 - 36:11)
damage than a full health tyion also if (36:05 - 36:12)
I if we're thinking of the same Doh bun (36:11 - 36:14)
build there was no special defense (36:12 - 36:16)
increase cuz you want all your stuff (36:14 - 36:20)
into defense to make body press better (36:16 - 36:22)
so like I can think of a million ways to (36:20 - 36:24)
make that better but you shouldn't be (36:22 - 36:28)
seeing it online because (36:24 - 36:32)
Al did we all forget what the word solo (36:28 - 36:36)
meant hey it worked out I kept him alive (36:32 - 36:38)
I knew what I had to do I knew when that (36:36 - 36:41)
person showed up what my job was as a (36:38 - 36:44)
Giant grocery chain I needed to make (36:41 - 36:47)
sure it was raining and I needed to heal (36:44 - 36:48)
and (36:47 - 36:50)
occasionally shared off a chilling (36:48 - 36:53)
Waters that I literally spent 20 minutes (36:50 - 36:56)
getting enough ckits to make For No Good (36:53 - 36:57)
Reason thank you Steve (36:56 - 37:00)
Steve you should I I have like 30 (36:57 - 37:01)
chilling Waters you got you just you (37:00 - 37:03)
just grinding out those C you always (37:01 - 37:07)
need chilling water look it took me long (37:03 - 37:09)
enough to find my (37:07 - 37:12)
Nono Kroger in my home to move it over (37:09 - 37:15)
and move it back so I could move my go (37:12 - 37:18)
one over that took way too much of my (37:15 - 37:22)
time because I have 113 disorganized (37:18 - 37:24)
boxes and I was like it's in here (37:22 - 37:27)
somewhere I'm like oh I have a shiny (37:24 - 37:29)
that oh interesting when did I get a (37:27 - 37:31)
shiny zygard what what release was that (37:29 - 37:34)
that was the (37:31 - 37:34)
2008 July GameStop event and the fact (37:36 - 37:41)
that I knew that right there means we (37:39 - 37:42)
have to take a (37:41 - 37:47)
break it's sad it's sad and when we come (37:42 - 37:49)
back uh we got some more Pokemon news so (37:47 - 37:51)
we will be right (37:49 - 37:55)
back and we are back from our break uh (37:51 - 37:57)
before we get to the Pokémon go Stu (37:55 - 37:59)
stuff cuz there is some stuff uh I I (37:57 - 38:02)
meant to bring up with the tyan being (37:59 - 38:04)
fire type Tera that means we have just (38:02 - 38:07)
samarat (38:04 - 38:10)
left and well Technic for the Hui stuff (38:07 - 38:12)
oh okay yeah like I'm (38:10 - 38:15)
sure yeah I'm sure there will be other (38:12 - 38:18)
Seven Star raids no that's but they (38:15 - 38:21)
haven't repeated a (38:18 - 38:26)
Terra for sevenstar raids so if huan (38:21 - 38:30)
decision UI was grass and huian tyion (38:26 - 38:32)
was fire you would think that Hui and (38:30 - 38:34)
samura would be water but they did water (38:32 - 38:35)
with (38:34 - 38:39)
Pikachu so I think they could do dark (38:35 - 38:42)
type because that would be its other (38:39 - 38:44)
type (38:42 - 38:44)
and I I'm sure they will eventually (38:45 - 38:50)
repeat they're G to have to there's only (38:48 - 38:52)
so many types right right we I think we (38:50 - 38:54)
only have four left we have electric (38:52 - 38:58)
dark steel and (38:54 - 39:01)
and I can't remember the last one (38:58 - 39:04)
ground I think ground I think ground I (39:01 - 39:06)
don't remember the giant Earth on (39:04 - 39:09)
anything's heads so yeah Chestnut was (39:06 - 39:13)
Rock so either they do water which makes (39:09 - 39:14)
sense with the other ones that would be (39:13 - 39:17)
our first repeating type um or they (39:14 - 39:19)
could easily do dark and I don't think (39:17 - 39:21)
anyone would question (39:19 - 39:24)
that if anything break pattern either (39:21 - 39:27)
way yeah iron iron hands would be very (39:24 - 39:33)
happy um yeah finally our time to (39:27 - 39:33)
shine so I guess we'll see there was (39:35 - 39:39)
there was some time (39:37 - 39:43)
between tyion (39:39 - 39:45)
and deui right there was like a week of (39:43 - 39:47)
nothing in between yeah yeah cuz that's (39:45 - 39:50)
when they did the Halloween stuff so it (39:47 - 39:53)
this tyan is what days is it just this (39:50 - 39:56)
weekend uh it's it's also next weekend (39:53 - 40:00)
the 9th 10th and 11th which I (39:56 - 40:05)
think next weekend is also a (40:00 - 40:07)
regionals which has always made sense (40:05 - 40:09)
usually brand new that weekend and then (40:07 - 40:11)
there's some sort of (40:09 - 40:14)
battle (40:11 - 40:14)
um and (40:14 - 40:19)
then I guess after that would be the (40:16 - 40:21)
16th 17th 18th which is before (40:19 - 40:23)
Thanksgiving and then the week of (40:21 - 40:26)
Thanksgiving mhm so they could do (40:23 - 40:28)
something there and it would just repeat (40:26 - 40:31)
into Thanksgiving weekend which is (40:28 - 40:33)
probably they probably want a raid that (40:31 - 40:36)
weekend right there's no that would (40:33 - 40:38)
there's no other (40:36 - 40:40)
events people are going to be at home (40:38 - 40:42)
with their switch right I mean they are (40:40 - 40:44)
on depends on how much they're trying to (40:42 - 40:47)
get things crammed in before the 14th (40:44 - 40:49)
like how many things do they want to (40:47 - 40:52)
have happen leading up to the 14th right (40:49 - 40:54)
I would imagine that they want to cram (40:52 - 40:55)
as much in to sort of get people back (40:54 - 40:57)
into playing their game right before (40:55 - 40:59)
their DLC comes out so I would imagine (40:57 - 41:03)
they're going to do something pretty you (40:59 - 41:04)
would you would also Imagine they would (41:03 - 41:08)
do a raid I I just I think back to (41:04 - 41:14)
like Mewtwo and how popular mewu was and (41:08 - 41:16)
then I also think back to (41:14 - 41:20)
Greninja like Greninja was so incredibly (41:16 - 41:21)
popular I mean the game was still very (41:20 - 41:24)
early on right ninja was the second no (41:21 - 41:27)
sorry the the second or the third um (41:24 - 41:31)
raid but Greninja was by far up there (41:27 - 41:34)
with like Charizard and (41:31 - 41:36)
Mewtwo I hate to say it I don't think (41:34 - 41:39)
huian samarat is up (41:36 - 41:41)
there (41:39 - 41:44)
maybe because it's Thanksgiving they go (41:41 - 41:46)
with my Flamingo idea Seven Star (41:44 - 41:48)
Flamingo flightless birds for (41:46 - 41:51)
Thanksgiving because there's no turkey (41:48 - 41:55)
Pokemon yet uh and they take a break (41:51 - 41:59)
maybe Samurai comes out in December and (41:55 - 42:01)
they just (41:59 - 42:05)
do birds for (42:01 - 42:09)
Thanksgiving or or also Le chunk for ham (42:05 - 42:10)
what other (42:09 - 42:14)
foods are D from Pokemon Slowpoke for (42:10 - 42:15)
the delicious Slowpoke tail that (42:14 - 42:17)
everybody has at every Thanksgiving (42:15 - 42:21)
feast I I still think I I I don't think (42:17 - 42:23)
it's going to be before DLC I think it's (42:21 - 42:25)
going to be after DLC to like sell more (42:23 - 42:27)
copies I still think there's going to be (42:25 - 42:29)
a Shiny Rayquaza Seven Star raid (42:27 - 42:34)
eventually oh yeah once the anime is out (42:29 - 42:38)
in uh other languages (42:34 - 42:41)
especially (42:38 - 42:41)
2024 do we have a wait do we know when (42:41 - 42:46)
Horizons comes out (42:44 - 42:49)
no I it's not this (42:46 - 42:52)
[Music] (42:49 - 42:55)
year they they still saying winter (42:52 - 42:57)
2023 (42:55 - 42:59)
there's no date on (42:57 - 43:01)
Horizons that I've seen yeah I think (42:59 - 43:03)
when Horizon eventually comes out (43:01 - 43:04)
they're going to line up uh Shiny (43:03 - 43:07)
Rayquaza cuz I you again what I just (43:04 - 43:08)
said what Pokemon is as popular as (43:07 - 43:11)
Mewtwo Charizard Greninja it's 100% (43:08 - 43:14)
Rayquaza you want you want somebody that (43:11 - 43:17)
has a bad taste in their mouth of (43:14 - 43:18)
scarlet and violet but they will come (43:17 - 43:20)
back no matter (43:18 - 43:24)

time you're going to be able to get mega (46:42 - 46:47)
Garchomp energy for a for the (46:44 - 46:49)
foreseeable future so if you want mega (46:47 - 46:51)
Garchomp if you want to Mega that (46:49 - 46:53)
Garchomp from Summer of (46:51 - 46:56)
2021 that's the day to do it that's the (46:53 - 47:00)
day you have to get those raids (46:56 - 47:00)
in (47:00 - 47:03)
yeah yeah unlike other Mega raids this (47:04 - 47:10)
is not around for two weeks at a time (47:07 - 47:15)
mhm it is a single day it is three hours (47:10 - 47:17)
didn't Niantic do something cuz the the (47:15 - 47:21)
first time they did like spend the $5 to (47:17 - 47:23)
was the (47:21 - 47:27)
Blazin Mar septile and then people were (47:23 - 47:29)
like I paid the $5 for (47:27 - 47:32)
XL wait what did I say Swampert oh (47:29 - 47:35)
Swampert oh I said martop yeah mega mega (47:32 - 47:40)
martop is crazy great it is a very (47:35 - 47:43)
unique way to get that though uh cuz (47:40 - 47:45)
people were like hey I paid the $5 I (47:43 - 47:47)
didn't get any extra XL candy compared (47:45 - 47:50)
to my friend who didn't pay the $5 I (47:47 - 47:52)
felt like Niantic did something but it (47:50 - 47:54)
was like it was like here's two raid (47:52 - 47:56)
passes where sori was broken or (47:54 - 47:59)
something like that it wasn't good (47:56 - 48:02)
that's very possible I was mostly (47:59 - 48:05)
focused on the megas that day the XL (48:02 - 48:08)
candy wasn't going to be a good bonus (48:05 - 48:11)
anyway they're not they're not generous (48:08 - 48:12)
with the (48:11 - 48:17)
XL anything yeah increased chance (48:12 - 48:20)
doesn't I mean it's broad enough where (48:17 - 48:21)
they're not guaranteeing anything (48:20 - 48:25)
increase could be an extra one candy (48:21 - 48:29)
could be an extra one per (48:25 - 48:29)
200 that's what it was for the Halloween (48:29 - 48:35)
event I I have no faith in them being (48:32 - 48:37)
generous with this candy is this going (48:35 - 48:38)
to (48:37 - 48:40)
be is this a thing Hannah I don't (48:38 - 48:44)
remember I I think this was like uh the (48:40 - 48:47)
the the not the weird deer um the cleor (48:44 - 48:50)
or The Bravery do we know if Garchomp's (48:47 - 48:53)
resetting every hour on the hour (48:50 - 48:57)
for gyms that was a norm for the last (48:53 - 49:00)
few raid days so my guess would be (48:57 - 49:03)
yes so ideally if I go to mall America (49:00 - 49:07)
there's what seven gyms but I'm getting (49:03 - 49:12)
14 raid passes so I go there at two do (49:07 - 49:15)
the whole round wait till three another (49:12 - 49:19)
round should repop up from what we have (49:15 - 49:23)
seen recently I would say yes okay but (49:19 - 49:24)
it's (49:23 - 49:27)
Niantic so who knows (49:24 - 49:30)
correct (49:27 - 49:30)
corre our game could possibly work this (49:31 - 49:40)
weekend but for $5 you may have to find (49:36 - 49:43)
out I'm G to go at it with the free (49:40 - 49:45)
passes hope that I can find enough other (49:43 - 49:48)
people who are doing the raids cuz I (49:45 - 49:50)
like the new Mega System I still like (49:48 - 49:52)
the new Mega (49:50 - 49:55)
System but having only 3 hours to get (49:52 - 49:57)
this Mega is a little bit stressful just (49:55 - 49:59)
a little (49:57 - 50:03)
bit um 3 hours that's so long but you (49:59 - 50:04)
need other (50:03 - 50:07)
people although if I found at least one (50:04 - 50:09)
other person who had highle Pokemon and (50:07 - 50:11)
could do a party play that's probably (50:09 - 50:16)
enough people to do these raids yeah (50:11 - 50:19)
probably it's time to you time to party (50:16 - 50:21)
play I'm sure a party player 4 could (50:19 - 50:24)
easily do everything as well oh yeah (50:21 - 50:27)
yeah yeah (50:24 - 50:29)
uh this came out of nowhere they (50:27 - 50:34)
announced a Pokemon go City Safari in uh (50:29 - 50:36)
I don't know how to say this I'm sorry (50:34 - 50:40)
taian Taiwan Tai well it's Taiwan so Tai (50:36 - 50:45)
Nan I think 's probably close enough (50:40 - 50:48)
it's gonna be on March 9th and (50:45 - 50:53)
10th it's going to be 300 NT which is (50:48 - 50:56)
New Taiwan dollars I think that's what (50:53 - 51:00)
that's short for um which I (50:56 - 51:05)
believe 300 is 13 of the American dollar (51:00 - 51:07)
so that should be (51:05 - 51:09)
$9 uh if you convert that you should (51:07 - 51:10)
just times it by (51:09 - 51:15)
three uh and then the safari hat Eevee (51:10 - 51:18)
will make its return which was not in (51:15 - 51:20)
the wild it was you were limited to how (51:18 - 51:22)
many you could catch in Barcelona and (51:20 - 51:24)
Mexico and (51:22 - 51:26)
Korea (51:24 - 51:29)
uh they have a lot of Pokemon spawning (51:26 - 51:30)
the wild not going to go through skadoo (51:29 - 51:34)
is coming back um but the regional (51:30 - 51:36)
exclusive is balant and if you've (51:34 - 51:38)
listened to this podcast as I traveled (51:36 - 51:42)
the world for whatever reason balant is (51:38 - 51:44)
one of the most in demand Pokemon (51:42 - 51:47)
especially in Asia countries I would say (51:44 - 51:49)
it's demand down anywhere that isn't New (51:47 - 51:52)
York in the United States as (51:49 - 51:56)
well um so interest in enough you're (51:52 - 51:58)
probably like oh (51:56 - 52:01)
uh where is (51:58 - 52:07)
tyan uh nowhere near (52:01 - 52:07)
anything it is uh they're building a (52:09 - 52:16)
Pokemon Center in Taiwan which I believe (52:12 - 52:17)
opens in December they don't have a (52:16 - 52:23)
release date for that but uh I uh the (52:17 - 52:24)
Pokemon Center is in (52:23 - 52:30)
Taipei and tyan is three hours on a (52:24 - 52:32)
bullet train south of (52:30 - 52:35)
taipe so that's a if you are flying into (52:32 - 52:37)
Taipei which I think is their biggest (52:35 - 52:39)
airport and is where the Pokemon Center (52:37 - 52:42)
is and I think is where a lot of Tourism (52:39 - 52:44)
would (52:42 - 52:47)
go 3 hours there and 3 hours back is (52:44 - 52:50)
definitely doable for a day trip but (52:47 - 52:52)
three hours on a bullet train is also a (52:50 - 52:56)
ways yeah yeah (52:52 - 52:58)
I think it's an I think it's an hour (52:56 - 53:00)
flight but probably don't want to jump (52:58 - 53:04)
on a flight from taipe to Tian I don't (53:00 - 53:08)
know bu Busan to Soul I think is also (53:04 - 53:10)
three hours in the bullet train and I (53:08 - 53:13)
did hear SLC a lot of people come from (53:10 - 53:19)
Busan to Soul to do that event um Busan (53:13 - 53:23)
busin I'm not sure which one Busan busin (53:19 - 53:25)
it might be busin somebody somebody (53:23 - 53:28)
correct me I I've heard his Busan a lot (53:25 - 53:31)
so I have no idea the sound ah is (53:28 - 53:33)
probably more likely to be in the (53:31 - 53:36)
language so also tyan is probably (53:33 - 53:40)
probably right it looks like tyan taipe (53:36 - 53:43)
Taiwan we'll get there we're this (53:40 - 53:45)
podcast is slowly becoming International (53:43 - 53:47)
we'll get there (53:45 - 53:52)
slowly so cool event uh Niantic loves (53:47 - 53:53)
their (53:52 - 53:57)
Islands they love putting these every (53:53 - 53:59)
island except Australia and New Zealand (53:57 - 54:02)
you all get nothing down (53:59 - 54:05)
there that's (54:02 - 54:08)
true (54:05 - 54:11)
um so uh I'm going to assume that (54:08 - 54:13)
there's going to be more Safari zones I (54:11 - 54:14)
think there was like maybe a rumored (54:13 - 54:16)
Safari Zone for South America and I (54:14 - 54:18)
think there was one for (54:16 - 54:22)
Australia so remember City safaris not (54:18 - 54:26)
Safari zones oh yeah sorry City Safaris (54:22 - 54:27)
different (54:26 - 54:29)
events (54:27 - 54:33)
um but the the the South Korea one went (54:29 - 54:35)
good I don't know how well the Barcelona (54:33 - 54:36)
one went I don't (54:35 - 54:39)
actually I I think tone went to (54:36 - 54:41)
Barcelona but I don't know if it was (54:39 - 54:44)
laid out the same way of like yes they (54:41 - 54:46)
put the stops in a way to make you go (54:44 - 54:48)
the way they want you to (54:46 - 54:52)
go they said in a blog post interview (54:48 - 54:54)
with gohub that that was very (54:52 - 54:55)
intentional and that they were worked (54:54 - 54:58)
with local trainers and I think guides (54:55 - 55:00)
to help Place those although I think I (54:58 - 55:02)
remember tone mentioning in the slack (55:00 - 55:04)
that one of those special stops at least (55:02 - 55:07)
one maybe two were blocked off by other (55:04 - 55:10)
events happening in the city at the time (55:07 - 55:13)
so not sure whether they could have (55:10 - 55:16)
planned for that but that seemed a bit (55:13 - 55:19)
unfortunate (55:16 - 55:19)
yeah but uh cool for sou uh cool for (55:19 - 55:29)
Taiwan um I don't know if I'll look Papa (55:24 - 55:32)
Niantic Mr John hanky uh instead of (55:29 - 55:33)
getting yourself another yacht if you (55:32 - 55:36)
would like to send me to Taiwan to play (55:33 - 55:38)
Pokémon go I will I will say yes I'll go (55:36 - 55:42)
coach uh it won't take a lot out of your (55:38 - 55:44)
very big (55:42 - 55:47)
salary I don't I don't know if John (55:44 - 55:48)
hanky has even opened Pokemon go in like (55:47 - 55:51)
the last two (55:48 - 55:51)
years B that that man was really excited (55:52 - 55:58)
about paradot when I saw him in Germany (55:56 - 56:01)
though is that still happening yeah well (55:58 - 56:05)
paradot is way more AR focused than (56:01 - 56:07)
Pokemon go I think the most AR I ever (56:05 - 56:10)
use in Pokemon go is like to make the (56:07 - 56:12)
little lunchable sandwich ad to get (56:10 - 56:14)
Hannah knows what I'm talking about you (56:12 - 56:16)
got to get that Stardust you get the you (56:14 - 56:19)
get the good berries from that make that (56:16 - 56:21)
I had I have a friend staying over with (56:19 - 56:23)
me this weekend and it was the first (56:21 - 56:25)
time he opened Pokémon go in like 2 (56:23 - 56:26)
years (56:25 - 56:27)
I was like trying to like get lucky (56:26 - 56:30)
trades out of him cuz I I cuz we played (56:27 - 56:35)
when it came out in 2018 or what 17 um (56:30 - 56:39)
and he was like this is so dumb as he (56:35 - 56:43)
starts to assemble the Lunchable AR (56:39 - 56:45)
sandwich was his sound on cuz that makes (56:43 - 56:48)
it even worse no I don't think so he was (56:45 - 56:52)
like usually I pay games to turn this (56:48 - 56:56)
off yep but at least you get Rewards (56:52 - 56:58)
yeah yeah I think the rewards are pretty (56:56 - 57:03)
good for a 30 second they are ad coming (56:58 - 57:05)
from Niantic since they are not very (57:03 - 57:07)
generous with things most of the time I (57:05 - 57:09)
am surprised that the rewards continue (57:07 - 57:13)
to be pretty good on (57:09 - 57:15)
those (57:13 - 57:17)
yeah (57:15 - 57:19)
um I I think the the last bit of Pokemon (57:17 - 57:22)
Go News which we've done a very bad job (57:19 - 57:25)
at covering is there's an exclusive (57:22 - 57:29)
twitch Prime Amazon research that you (57:25 - 57:31)
can get (57:29 - 57:35)
so if you have Amazon Prime oh boy this (57:31 - 57:36)
sounds like a twitch well it is a twitch (57:35 - 57:38)
ad if you have Amazon Prime you can (57:36 - 57:41)
connect it to your Twitch account and (57:38 - 57:43)
then you should use your Amazon you (57:41 - 57:44)
should use your you should use that on a (57:43 - 57:46)
streamer because it's free money and it (57:44 - 57:50)
supports them so if you can use if you (57:46 - 57:51)
don't know you can use it on me uh but (57:50 - 57:53)
there's a bunch of small streamers that (57:51 - 57:56)
would appreciate your Twitch Prime um um (57:53 - 57:58)
so but you get it every month you get it (57:56 - 58:00)
every 30 days so as long as you're (57:58 - 58:03)
paying the Amazon scam price of $140 a (58:00 - 58:05)
year which I am guilty of that (58:03 - 58:08)
too use it because the only person that (58:05 - 58:11)
wins is Amazon if you don't use it it is (58:08 - 58:13)
free money into somebody's pocket so if (58:11 - 58:15)
your friend is streaming or a small (58:13 - 58:16)
streamer that you like to watch or you (58:15 - 58:18)
watch a big streamer and you just don't (58:16 - 58:22)
want to see an ad every four minutes use (58:18 - 58:24)
it there because it removes the ads but (58:22 - 58:26)
more more importantly if you don't care (58:24 - 58:28)
about twitch at all you should still (58:26 - 58:32)
link it because Pokémon go does a lot of (58:28 - 58:35)
stuff with Amazon and twitch so when you (58:32 - 58:38)
link it you get an exclusive research (58:35 - 58:41)
which gives you the griver hat for free (58:38 - 58:42)
but it also gives you a bunch of other (58:41 - 58:46)
stuff um and it's it's relatively easy (58:42 - 58:48)
research but like I'm on like the final (58:46 - 58:50)
step which is defeat five rocket grunts (58:48 - 58:53)
which is asking a lot for me but I also (58:50 - 58:55)
have like three other Just A Team Rocket (58:53 - 58:58)
event I know that's why I haven't done (58:55 - 59:00)
any of it I'm saving it all for one I'm (58:58 - 59:02)
mean when I every time I do one grun (59:00 - 59:03)
it's going to check off like six (59:02 - 59:05)
different (59:03 - 59:08)
things um so again if you have Amazon (59:05 - 59:09)
Prime and you're listening and you play (59:08 - 59:12)
Pokemon go they do this like once a (59:09 - 59:14)
month they have some sort (59:12 - 59:17)
of item usually it's like one incubator (59:14 - 59:20)
or one incense or something but this (59:17 - 59:23)
time it I think it ends in a a week or (59:20 - 59:25)
two this well claiming it does (59:23 - 59:27)
this time it's a four-step event (59:25 - 59:29)
research that gives you some stuff the (59:27 - 59:30)
cool (59:29 - 59:34)
stuff so I don't know do (59:30 - 59:38)
that do that I guess uh Greg give me the (59:34 - 59:42)
state of Pokemon unite uh Pokemon night (59:38 - 59:44)
is good uh I think the Halloween (59:42 - 59:48)
event is done I think it's done I think (59:44 - 59:50)
it's done as of this recording as of (59:48 - 59:51)
this recording I think it's done I think (59:50 - 59:54)
it's out (59:51 - 59:57)
uh mimiku is great we don't have a (59:54 - 59:59)
release date on the next one which is (59:57 - 60:01)
meow Scara uh but that looks very very (59:59 - 60:04)
fun so I'm excited for that to come in (60:01 - 60:06)
I'm (60:04 - 60:06)
imagining whatever date a lot of things (60:06 - 60:11)
are happening raid wise would be the (60:09 - 60:14)
that meow Kara is (60:11 - 60:18)
released uh the New Balance patch is in (60:14 - 60:21)
it's it's made the game much much much (60:18 - 60:23)
more enjoyable the new season has (60:21 - 60:24)
started so if you really want to do (60:23 - 60:26)
ranked you can I haven't had time to (60:24 - 60:28)
play (60:26 - 60:30)
because I have a pesky thing called the (60:28 - 60:33)
job so I can't spend two hours at (60:30 - 60:36)
playing anymore shoe is on the other (60:33 - 60:39)
foot yeah no I can't be mastering cuz I (60:36 - 60:44)
got to earn dollars um I think (60:39 - 60:48)
overall after sort of The Nightmare of (60:44 - 60:50)
Mewtwo uh they nerfed Mewtwo in the (60:48 - 60:52)
ground and you just don't now you don't (60:50 - 60:54)
see Mewtwo that much anymore people are (60:52 - 60:55)
like nope I've can't hit the button to (60:54 - 60:59)
win I'm not doing it um but overall I (60:55 - 61:01)
think the game is in a good (60:59 - 61:05)
spot we don't H they haven't changed the (61:01 - 61:06)
game in a (61:05 - 61:08)
while uh we don't have a new map we (61:06 - 61:10)
don't (61:08 - 61:14)
have much much that's new so everybody's (61:10 - 61:17)
sort of bracing for when they're going (61:14 - 61:20)
to decide to switch everything up again (61:17 - 61:22)
and do a whole new map and do all the (61:20 - 61:25)
things um but otherwise if if you just (61:22 - 61:29)
want to jump in see mimiku scooch around (61:25 - 61:32)
the battlefield and big Shadow CLA that (61:29 - 61:34)
come out because everybody only plays (61:32 - 61:37)
one set right now for MIM Q so expect (61:34 - 61:39)
that to be nerfed or the other two to be (61:37 - 61:40)
buffed but they'll Nerf it because MIM (61:39 - 61:41)
is a little (61:40 - 61:44)
overpowered um it's a good time to jump (61:41 - 61:46)
in and if you haven't played in a while (61:44 - 61:48)
and you played before you'll get a lot (61:46 - 61:51)
of rewards for coming (61:48 - 61:51)
back um all right and then uh this will (61:52 - 61:59)
come out Monday so you know Wooper (61:57 - 62:01)
Community day was amazing it was so much (61:59 - 62:03)
fun I can't believe (62:01 - 62:07)
that Rayquaza appeared in the (62:03 - 62:09)
sky people (62:07 - 62:12)
got rain down whoopers on everyone was (62:09 - 62:15)
wild wild Comedia really yeah I sure (62:12 - 62:18)
hope people who care about PVP got their (62:15 - 62:20)
great League Cloud sire they're not (62:18 - 62:22)
going to be meta breaking like they were (62:20 - 62:24)
originally going to be but they're going (62:22 - 62:26)
to work well in The Meta as far as as (62:24 - 62:29)
far as we can (62:26 - 62:29)
tell um yeah there's probably (62:30 - 62:37)
some Pokemon news that we're (62:34 - 62:40)
forgetting uh but well you know we (62:37 - 62:43)
covered the big stuff so the the luxury (62:40 - 62:45)
ball is now available on Pokemon Center (62:43 - 62:47)
I don't think it's sold out it was uh (62:45 - 62:49)
more expensive than the other ones it (62:47 - 62:52)
was as expensive as the master ball it's (62:49 - 62:54)
luxury that's true no it makes sense (62:52 - 62:58)
that a premium price for luxury it's (62:54 - 63:01)
very shiny thank you to everybody who (62:58 - 63:02)
blew up my (63:01 - 63:08)
phone including people at work uh also (63:02 - 63:11)
this is the thing I my phone people (63:08 - 63:13)
texted me it's out I went to Pokemon (63:11 - 63:16)
Center I searched luxury (63:13 - 63:19)
ball nothing I just click the email (63:16 - 63:22)
nothing nothing could not search find it (63:19 - 63:24)
so I went to Google and I searched and (63:22 - 63:26)
it brought me to England and I'm like I (63:24 - 63:27)
am not in (63:26 - 63:31)
England so I went into my email hit the (63:27 - 63:33)
link and then it went there and I'm like (63:31 - 63:35)
this should not have been this difficult (63:33 - 63:37)
I should have been able to search to (63:35 - 63:42)
prevent scalpers true but I (63:37 - 63:44)
think (63:42 - 63:47)
that except for scalpers in England (63:44 - 63:48)
because that one was really easy to find (63:47 - 63:50)
so get wrecked (63:48 - 63:53)
UK yeah uh I don't I don't think the (63:50 - 63:55)
luxury ball sold out the only the only (63:53 - 63:56)
Pokeballs that I remember selling out (63:55 - 63:58)
was love ball and that was like really (63:56 - 64:00)
good marketing they put it out like what (63:58 - 64:02)
a week before Valentine's Day or (64:00 - 64:03)
something it was like super good (64:02 - 64:06)
marketing and they promised a golden (64:03 - 64:08)
love disc in each one and they didn't (64:06 - 64:09)
and the master ball sold out in a couple (64:08 - 64:11)
hours like three four hours that was (64:09 - 64:14)
gone cuz they only made 5,000 of (64:11 - 64:18)
those so it's like one catch guaranteed (64:14 - 64:19)
of course you're going to get the master (64:18 - 64:24)
ball one and done one and done um did (64:19 - 64:25)
they have any was this the last one that (64:24 - 64:27)
they announced yeah this is the last one (64:25 - 64:29)
I think they announced I don't remember (64:27 - 64:32)
seeing any I remember looking recently (64:29 - 64:34)
at their list and I don't remember (64:32 - 64:36)
seeing anything on it yeah netball and (64:34 - 64:38)
dive ball I remember them announcing at (64:36 - 64:39)
the same time and I was like oh you're (64:38 - 64:41)
doing both water balls that don't really (64:39 - 64:44)
do they kind of did different things but (64:41 - 64:47)
then not really not really anymore cuz (64:44 - 64:49)
like you can't fish in scarlet and (64:47 - 64:51)
violet and you can't dive in scarlet and (64:49 - 64:53)
violet so as long as you're on (64:51 - 64:56)
water I don't know (64:53 - 64:59)
they look different they look different (64:56 - 65:02)
there's no like this ball works on snow (64:59 - 65:04)
pokeemon there's no snowball snowball (65:02 - 65:05)
that's what they (65:04 - 65:07)
need I feel like we're due for a new (65:05 - 65:09)
Pokeball last new Pokeball we got was (65:07 - 65:12)
like what strange ball which I do love (65:09 - 65:14)
if they made a strange ball that would (65:12 - 65:17)
be so cool the Beast ball we got five (65:14 - 65:21)
new balls in Legends but they they're (65:17 - 65:23)
not new they all turn into strange balls (65:21 - 65:25)
well jet ball wings (65:23 - 65:29)
ball huan heavy ball (65:25 - 65:32)
giganta giganta giganta ball and the (65:29 - 65:33)
normal (65:32 - 65:35)
one little (65:33 - 65:39)
ball double heavy ball triple ball (65:35 - 65:42)
they're all they're (65:39 - 65:42)
like I don't know I I I I was mad at (65:42 - 65:47)
first that they turned into the strange (65:46 - 65:49)
ball and then I ended up really liking (65:47 - 65:51)
the strange ball and then when you move (65:49 - 65:54)
them back they go back into the wing (65:51 - 65:55)
ball (65:54 - 65:57)
and people thought for a long time that (65:55 - 65:58)
the wing ball was super effective on (65:57 - 66:00)
flying Pokemon but the only difference (65:58 - 66:04)
was that you just threw it farther yeah (66:00 - 66:07)
it went farther the heavy ball in that (66:04 - 66:09)
game doesn't work the same as the heavy (66:07 - 66:12)
ball in the other games which was really (66:09 - 66:13)
weird that they decided to go with that (66:12 - 66:14)
naming (66:13 - 66:17)
scheme he just kind of walked up behind (66:14 - 66:18)
things and lobbed it on the ground and (66:17 - 66:21)
hope he hit cuz that thing was Heavy (66:18 - 66:24)
here's the thing they have already so (66:21 - 66:27)
mess up the huian timeline place where (66:24 - 66:30)
they've just said they're here now deal (66:27 - 66:32)
with it we don't know how they got here (66:30 - 66:35)
it's fine just bring the balls (66:32 - 66:39)
in no I like the strange balls I mean I (66:35 - 66:42)
like bring the balls in just bring the (66:39 - 66:45)
balls in you've already have brought in (66:42 - 66:48)
the Pokemon for no reason no explanation (66:45 - 66:51)
they've just showed up just they're not (66:48 - 66:53)
in like the wild in (66:51 - 66:55)
Pala (66:53 - 66:56)
yeah but they didn't explain how they (66:55 - 66:58)
got how they got here in raids how did (66:56 - 67:00)
you get the one for free how did they (66:58 - 67:02)
show up why are they here at least in (67:00 - 67:04)
Masters they bothered to say they got (67:02 - 67:08)
sucked through space and time in these (67:04 - 67:10)
games they like they can't even get this (67:08 - 67:12)
game to run at like 12 frames a second (67:10 - 67:15)
you want them to explain (67:12 - 67:19)
yes yes I do I want one line of dialogue (67:15 - 67:23)
hidden in some dark cor was so bad his (67:19 - 67:27)
anger ripped at time hole in the (67:23 - 67:31)
space I can explain it Hoopa that is the (67:27 - 67:34)
explanation for every Pokemon issue in (67:31 - 67:37)
the world Hoopa opens a ring it goes you (67:34 - 67:39)
are lucky you were frozen for most of (67:37 - 67:42)
that and we only came back in for Hoopa (67:39 - 67:44)
does a ring so I did not get more Angry (67:42 - 67:46)
than I am right now oh I went from Kier (67:44 - 67:50)
into Hoopa either way a ring is (67:46 - 67:55)
opening Kieran is hoopa there we (67:50 - 67:59)
go they're both short people like he he (67:55 - 68:02)
shrinks even more here let me ask can I (67:59 - 68:05)
shove can I shove both like offensively (68:02 - 68:08)
I just meant like sizewise Kier is a (68:05 - 68:11)
small boy and Hoopa can also be small (68:08 - 68:14)
boy that came out very wrong here is my (68:11 - 68:16)
question can I shove both into a bottle (68:14 - 68:19)
if I can then I will follow your theory (68:16 - 68:22)
up cool let me shove Kieran into a (68:19 - 68:25)
bottle and cork it and check it off the (68:22 - 68:26)
side of blueberry Academy would you like (68:25 - 68:29)
Kieran more if he was secretly a Pokemon (68:26 - 68:33)
he was a zor the entire time no because (68:29 - 68:37)
I like Pokemon and I do not like K we (68:33 - 68:38)
kind of got that in black and white (68:37 - 68:40)
wasn't there like a a person that was (68:38 - 68:42)
like a Zoroark at one point it was like (68:40 - 68:45)
a non-talking (68:42 - 68:45)
character wasn't there a person on the (68:46 - 68:50)
side of the mountain in black and white (68:48 - 68:51)
that you talk to and then if you talk to (68:50 - 68:53)
him a second time they turned into a (68:51 - 68:55)
Zork and then ran away (68:53 - 68:58)
I I thought I thought was the trailer (68:55 - 68:59)
park wasn't that the story of the (68:58 - 69:01)
trailer park there yeah there might have (68:59 - 69:04)
been one of the trailer park too I don't (69:01 - 69:07)
remember wasn't Zorua was really hard to (69:04 - 69:08)
get in black and white (69:07 - 69:10)
right and then they made it easier in (69:08 - 69:12)
black two white I think it was just in (69:10 - 69:15)
the grass yeah I think there's only one (69:12 - 69:17)
in black and white through that event (69:15 - 69:20)
and then there was easier yeah I think (69:17 - 69:21)
that's right I don't know look that was (69:20 - 69:23)
hey did you know CIO is in the Scarlet (69:21 - 69:28)
sword and shield d what where that's (69:23 - 69:31)
wild I wonder if Reggie gigas is in that (69:28 - 69:32)
game (69:31 - 69:34)
too it's always funny when people are (69:32 - 69:36)
like there's nothing to do in Pokemon (69:34 - 69:39)
games and then they're like wait Kelly (69:36 - 69:44)

thought it was fun yeah I didn't even (69:49 - 69:54)
finish the I didn't start the gold quest (69:52 - 69:56)
line I think it only takes like an hour (69:54 - 70:00)
or so to do that and I didn't finish (69:56 - 70:03)
the ogre Clan stuff um because obviously (70:00 - 70:05)
